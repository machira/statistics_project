Literacy
Narrative
For
most
of
my
life,
writing
has
been
a
process
through
which
I
relay
to
others
what
I
have
learned.
Like
a
shadow,
it
has
followed
me
throughout
my
life
(regardless
of
how
cleverly
I
tried
to
evade
it.)
My
writing
ability
and
style
have
developed
and
changed
with
me.
The
stages
of
my
life
as
a
writer
have
progressed
parallel
to
my
advancement
through
various
writing
implements.
These
five
stages
are:
the
pencil
years,
the
pen
years,
my
transition
to
typing,
my
Apple
IIe
years,
and
my
IBM-compatible
years.
As
I
advanced
through
these
phases,
I
similarly
developed
as
a
writer.
I
will
provide
for
you
an
autobiography
of
my
life
as
a
writer.
As
I
pondered
my
approach
to
this
paper,
I
realized
that
all
the
values
by
which
I
live
I
learned
during
my
pencil
years.
The
evidence
for
this
is
documented
by
my
written
work
during
these
years.
I
learned
compromise
and
cooperation,
exemplified
by
the
following
journal
entry
for
my
third
grade
class:
January
17,
1983.
Dear
bed,
I
will
stop
jumping
on
you
if
you
will
stop
pulling
the
covers
off
me.
Your
friend,
Michelle.
In
another
entry
I
described
my
duties
as
President
of
the
United
States
as
stopping
pollution,
preserving
wildlife,
helping
the
poor
and
stopping
drunk
drivers.
I
am
now
expanding
these
ideals
that
I
learned
in
grammar
school
into
a
future
career
in
environmental
science.
My
work
during
the
pencil
years
was
a
tool
with
which
I
learned
the
basics
of
writing.
The
pencil
was
a
manifestation
of
my
writing
level
at
that
time.
Its
most
essential
quality
was
its
impermanence,
which
was
appropriate
for
my
writing
ability
then.
The
focus
of
my
writing
during
those
years
was
mastering
the
basics,
such
as
spelling,
grammar
and
syntax.
Content
was
of
secondary
concern.
My
assignments
took
the
form
of
journal
entries,
letters
to
parents
or
teachers,
and
thank
you
notes.
These
were
often
brought
home
as
cards
to
my
family,
or
in
journals
with
encouraging
notes
from
my
teachers.
It
was
during
these
years
that
I
formed
the
foundation
for
my
literary
future.
My
work
was
tentative,
yet
full
of
imaginative
tales
and
eager
dreams.
When
I
advanced
to
the
pen
years,
my
writing
ability
reached
a
level
of
permanence.
I
no
longer
had
the
freedom
to
erase
my
errors
as
before.
A
concrete
foundation
had
been
laid,
and
I
began
to
build
the
framework
around
which
I
would
develop
my
writing
skills.
In
school
I
explored
fictional
writing.
I
wove
tales
of
fantasy
and
mystery
for
my
teachers.
I
imagined
myself
an
accomplished
novelist
at
the
age
of
ten.
I
was
overflowing
with
pride
at
the
completion
of
my
first
book,
entitled
Jane's
Unseen
World.
The
ten
page
text
depicted
the
touching
drama
of
a
blind
girl
who
found
happiness
with
a
best
friend.
With
the
professional
tools
available
(colored
construction
paper
and
markers)
I
made
the
cover
of
my
book
during
art
class,
including
the
official
stamp
of
the
Newbury
book
award.
It
was
my
first
finished
book,
complete
with
a
title
page,
dedication,
table
of
contents
and
a
fake
biography
of
the
famous
author
who
has
devoted
her
whole
life
to
writing
books.
My
teachers
remained
supportive
and
positive
about
my
early
efforts
in
writing...with
one
unusual
exception.
My
assignment
was
to
write
a
poem.
No
problem.
However,
my
impression
at
that
time
was
that
all
poetry
was
grim
and
somber.
I
thought
poets
wrote
exclusively
about
subjects
like
death
or
sorrow.
Following
these
guidelines,
I
wrote
a
one
page
poem
for
my
fifth
grade
teacher
entitled
Loneliness.
I
was
pleased
with
my
creative
insight
into
the
forlorn
world
of
a
lonely
person.
Unfortunately,
my
teacher
and
parents
did
not
share
in
my
pride!
We
had
a
meeting
after
school
to
find
out
if
I
was
suffering
from
depression.
I
remember
thinking
that
if
everyone
was
concerned
that
I
was
depressed,
It
must
have
been
a
convincing
poem.
The
third
stage
of
my
life
as
a
writer
was
a
transitional
one.
I
reached
a
point
in
my
academics
where
assignments
had
to
be
handed
in
typed.
Similarly,
my
writing
was
becoming
less
juvenile
and
more
structured.
However,
rather
than
typing
my
own
papers
I
continued
to
write
them
by
hand
and
my
mother
typed
them
for
me.
Part
of
the
blame
for
this
stage
goes
to
procrastination;
I
would
consistently
complete
my
papers
the
night
before
they
were
due.
Fortunately
for
me,
my
mother
types
65
words
per
minute,
while
my
rate
at
that
time
was
approximately
half
of
that.
Not
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
(and
far
from
the
last!)
my
mother
acted
as
my
savior.
During
this
stage
the
nature
of
my
assignments
was
shifting.
More
of
my
work
was
based
on
research,
and
writing
became
a
method
of
regurgitating
facts
or
histories.
I
was
bored
with
writing
and
regarded
it
only
as
a
chore
for
school.
The
positive
aspect
of
my
boredom
was
that
I
struggled
to
find
ways
to
make
what
I
wrote
more
interesting.
I
had
to
make
my
essay
on
eskimos
stand
apart
from
the
thirty
other
eskimo
essays
that
Mrs.
Winters
had
to
watch
us
present
to
the
class.
I
addressed
this
by
trying
to
find
a
unique
approach
to
my
assignments,
in
addition
to
including
extras
such
as
maps
and
illustrations.
For
my
eskimo
presentation,
I
tried
to
age
my
paper
by
browning
it
with
weak
tea
and
then
burning
the
edges
to
make
it
look
rough.
This
also
was
a
family
effort;
my
father
helped
prevent
me
from
burning
my
report!
The
fourth
stage
of
my
writing
history
was
my
Apple
IIe
stage.
For
those
of
you
who
are
not
familiar
with
computers,
this
particular
one
would
be
considered
obsolete
today.
Similarly,
my
work
during
this
phase
was
somewhat
remote
when
compared
to
the
pieces
of
writing
I
have
produced
in
college.
This
stage
also
witnessed
two
of
the
influential
figures
in
my
life
as
a
writer:
my
father
and
my
senior*
year
Rhetoric
teacher.
I
finally
learned
how
to
type
and
relieved
my
mother
of
her
burden.
In
her
place,
my
father
entered
as
my
personal
writing
associate.
He
saved
me
from
becoming
hopelessly
entangled
in
a
web
of
wordiness.
During
the
end
of
middle
school
and
the
beginning
of
high
school
I
found
the
thesaurus.
I
also
discovered
the
wonders
of
the
prepositional
phrase.
I
was
trying
to
write
in
a
more
sophisticated
style
and
my
shortcut
to
this
was
to
create
longer
words,
phrases
and
sentences.
I
would
fill
a
paragraph
trying
to
say
what
could
have
been
effectively
stated
in
a
few
sentences.
Fortunately,
my
father
did
everything
a
good
writing
associate
should
do.
He
checked
my
papers
for
organization
and
flow,
and
helped
me
write
more
concisely
while
retaining
the
content
and
style
that
I
had
created.
My
father
was
the
first
mentor
in
my
life
as
a
writer.
By
the
end
of
high
school
my
writing
had
expanded
to
cover
several
fields
of
study.
I
worked
on
lab
reports,
essays,
poetry
and
a
great
deal
of
analytical
work.
When
I
was
a
senior,
I
enrolled
in
a
Rhetoric
class.
One
of
my
goals
for
this
class
was
to
face
my
fear
of
public
speaking.
I
never
expected
the
effect
that
my
teacher,
Mrs.
Robey,
would
have
on
my
writing
style.
She
was
demanding
and
expected
the
best
work
from
us,
which
we
did
not
yet
realize
we
were
capable
of
accomplishing.
She
challenged
me
to
look
at
written
work
with
a
learned
and
critical
eye.
Most
importantly,
she
encouraged
each
student
to
discover
and
develop
a
personal
voice
in
our
writing.
For
these
reasons,
this
class
prepared
me
for
college
writing
more
than
any
other
training
in
high
school.
Mrs.
Robey
helped
me
to
personalize
my
writing,
and
she
instilled
in
me
the
confidence
to
expand
my
limits
as
a
writer.
Her
class
was
my
best
writing
experience.
When
I
say
that
Mrs.
Robey
helped
prepare
me
for
college
writing,
I
could
not
comprehend
this
at
the
time.
I
did
not
know
what
to
expect
in
college,
but
I
imagined
the
worst.
I
had
created
a
mental
nightmare
of
college
level
work.
The
campus
was
a
castle
haunted
by
ghosts
of
unattainable
goals;
the
professors
were
lewd
ogres;
and
I
was
an
intellectually
hobbled
child.
I
guess
you
could
say
I
was
a
little
nervous
leaving
high
school.
When
I
entered
college,
I
reached
my
current
literacy
stage:
the
IBM-compatible
years.
I
had
graduated
from
the
5'
x
5'
floppy
disks
of
the
Apple
IIe
to
the
3.5'
x
3'
hard
disks
of
Lafayette
College's
IBM-compatible
computers.
Both
academically
and
electronically,
I
had
advanced
to
a
new
phase
in
my
life.
I
faced
my
worst
fears
about
college
writing
that
had
materialized
in
my
high
school
dreams.
With
the
beginning
of
my
First
Year
Seminar
class,
I
finally
awoke
from
the
nightmare
I
had
created.
I
realized
that
I
was
safe
from
the
goblins
of
my
imagination.
In
actuality,
I
found
myself
adequately
prepared
to
handle
the
writing.
I
thank
my
father
and
Mrs.
Robey
for
that
luxury.
My
introduction
to
college
writing
was
actually
distressing.
I
had
not
envisioned
the
level
of
competition
between
students
that
I
encountered.
When
I
was
in
high
school
everyone
worked
to
the
best
of
his
or
her
ability,
and
expected
others
to
do
the
same.
However,
our
agenda
had
been
solely
to
expand
our
personal
abilities.
I
quickly
discovered
that
a
student's
hard
work
in
college
often
has
a
hidden
agenda.
Success
seems
to
be
measured
according
to
the
success
of
others
and
not
by
talent.
For
example,
I
returned
to
my
dorm
room
after
class
one
day
to
find
a
desperate
message
on
my
answering
machine
from
a
fellow
student
in
my
First
Year
Seminar
class.
She
had
to
know
what
grade
I
received
on
our
first
paper
because
she
was
not
satisfied
with
hers.
I
remember
that
message
as
not
only
an
invasion
of
my
privacy,
but
as
my
introduction
to
the
competitive
nature
of
college
students.
My
work
in
college
encompassed
all
forms
of
writing.
I
realized
that
persuasive
and
effective
writing
is
essential
in
life,
regardless
of
one's
career
choice.
In
every
field
of
academics,
one's
work
must
be
presented
clearly
in
a
written
form.
I
learned
how
to
alter
my
writing
style
depending
on
the
class
for
which
I
was
writing.
My
First
Year
Seminar
taught
me
how
to
write
persuasively.
When
writing
science
labs,
I
learned
the
organization
and
specifics
the
laboratory
report
format.
I
also
explored
some
creative
writing
outside
of
the
classroom.
The
most
helpful
tool
for
me
in
college
has
been
my
job
as
a
writing
associate.
By
helping
other
people,
I
have
strengthened
and
developed
my
own
skills.
In
this
age
of
technology
I
assume
I
will
someday
proceed
to
a
more
advanced
method
of
writing.
I
also
assume
that
I
will
continue
my
education
and
further
develop
my
writing
skills.
Education
and
technology
are
the
two
tools
that
I
have
found
are
necessary
to
succeed
in
one's
career
path.
They
have
advanced
side
by
side
throughout
my
life.
As
we
cannot
be
certain
of
what
technology
will
come
in
the
future,
I
do
not
know
what
lies
in
my
literary
and
academic
future.
