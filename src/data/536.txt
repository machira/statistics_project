WA
Literacy
Narrative
In
retrospect,
my
first
night
to
dinner
at
my
boyfriendOs
household
is
genuinely
amusing.
ItOs
the
kind
of
recollection
that
draws
a
bashful
laughter
from
the
mortified;
a
memory
that
comforts
the
humiliation
of
the
past
with
the
laughter
it
now
delivers.
Preparing
for
that
night
almost
eight
years
ago,
I
fretted
over
my
makeup
and
agonized
over
my
wardrobe.
I
never
would
have
fathomed
that
those
minutes
may
have
been
more
useful
spent
scrutinizing
my
Spanish
textbook.
As
I
sat
there
in
the
midst
of
a
gush
of
Spanish
babble
amongst
members
of
the
Ayala
family,
my
meticulously
styled
hair
and
carefully
chosen
shoes
did
nothing
to
wipe
the
flabbergasted
look
from
my
face.
Being
a
lovesick
teenage
girl
at
the
time,
I
was
determined
to
remedy
the
dilemma
that
had
arisen
with
my
beauOs
family.
Thus
began
my
ambition
to
become
proficient
in
the
Spanish
language.
Initially
driven
by
my
girlish
devotion,
I
pored
over
Castilian
grammar
and
vocabulary
like
a
law
student
over
there
LSAT
book.
With
each
passing
day,
interactions
with
my
boyfriendOs
family
became
more
manageable
and
productive.
After
a
year
I
was
still
far
from
fluent,
but
my
skill
had
improved
to
the
point
where
vital
phrases
(i.e.
NMore
rice
and
beans,
please!O)
were
staples
in
my
linguistic
arsenal.
Moreover,
the
enhancement
of
my
vernacular
did
much
more
than
simply
build
a
cordial
bridge
between
the
Ayala
family
and
I.
Rather,
as
I
strengthened
my
simple
communication
abilities,
I
found
the
Ayala
family
confiding
with
me
in
much
more
profound
ways.
Apparently,
my
effort
to
learn
their
native
tongue
not
only
united
us
on
a
practical
level,
but
also
familiarized
us
with
a
deeper
common
view.
Unfortunately,
like
most
teenage
romances,
the
flame
between
Mr.Ayala
and
I
eventually
died
out.
Nevertheless,
once
ignited,
my
desire
to
master
the
Spanish
language
was
unyielding
to
extinguishment.
The
concord
I
had
felt
with
the
Ayala
family
based
on
our
mutual
understanding
was
unforgettable.
Guarding
that
sentiment
as
my
main
motivation,
I
continued
to
dutifully
study
the
language
throughout
the
remainder
of
high
school.
I
relished
in
every
opportunity
that
arose
to
practice
my
pronunciation
and
speaking
skills,
whether
it
be
with
Jos,
the
dishwasher
at
the
restaurant
I
worked
in,
or
ordering
food
on
a
family
vacation
in
Mexico.
Upon
entering
college,
I
enrolled
in
a
variety
of
Spanish
classes
to
foster
my
budding
bilingualism,
as
well
as
broaden
my
cultural
horizons.
Up
until
this
point,
my
Spanish
education
had
been
limited
to
formal
classroom
sessions
and
scattered
conversations.
While
my
technical
skills
were
observably
improving,
I
yearned
to
apply
them
in
a
real-world
setting.
No
amount
of
chalkboard
comprehension
would
provide
me
with
all
the
trimmings
that
come
attached
to
a
language:
the
colloquialisms,
the
silly
phrases,
the
nonverbal
communication
by
means
of
body
language
and
facial
expressions.
Generally,
that
kind
of
authentic
education
is
only
attainable
in
a
crash-course
with
the
real
world.
Fortunately
enough,
I
was
granted
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
such
an
amazing,
yet
terrifying
experience
when
offered
the
chance
to
study
abroad.
The
word
ecstatic
does
not
quite
capture
my
emotional
state
when
I
first
received
my
letter
of
acceptance
to
the
Cross-Cultural
Center
of
Study
in
Seville,
Spain.
Jumping
around
the
room,
it
took
a
few
minutes
for
my
roommate
to
understand
why
I
was
shrieking
and
a
few
days
for
the
broad
grin
to
slowly
fade
from
my
face.
Although
I
was
anxious
about
the
prospect
of
leaving
everything
familiar
behind,
I
knew
that
the
rewards
of
this
trip
would
far
outweigh
my
foolish
apprehension.
Before
I
knew
it,
I
was
packing
my
bags,
waving
goodbye
to
all
I
was
accustomed
with,
and
boarding
my
Iberia
flight
for
Madrid.
As
clich
as
it
may
sound,
as
a
result
of
my
time
spent
studying
abroad,
my
outlook
on
the
world
has
forever
changed.
Somehow,
Europe
was
everything
and
nothing
I
expected
at
the
same
time.
I
didnOt
experience
culture
shock
or
any
striking
epiphanies,
yet
gradually
my
frame
of
mind
in
regards
to
everything
from
family
life
to
public
displays
of
affection
began
to
transform.
There
was
no
significant
shift
in
my
behavior,
yet
I
began
to
increasingly
appreciate
those
things
I
had
taken
for
granted
and
cast
a
critical
eye
on
those
matters
that
I
had
overlooked.
What
does
this
miniature
memoir
have
to
do
with
your
role
as
a
writer?
The
answer
is:
Everything.
To
begin
with,
I
would
not
be
the
person
I
am
today-
linguistically,
mentally
or
emotionally-
had
I
missed
out
on
this
experience.
Every
new
place
and
face
I
stumbled
upon
reflect
in
my
ability
as
a
writer
as
much
as
the
dialect
and
lingo
my
host
mother
attempted
to
brainwash
me
with.
Most
importantly,
it
developed
my
sense
of
self-
a
quality
that
is
inextricably
intertwined
with
and
reflected
in
my
writing.
For
example,
that
first
step
towards
Spain
and
away
from
all
things
homespun
and
habitual
immediately
served
as
a
catalyst
for
an
increased
sense
of
maturity
and
independence.
Likewise,
my
assimilation
into
a
new
culture
not
only
opened
my
eyes
to
the
novelty
of
othersO
customs
and
beliefs,
but
helped
aid
in
understanding
my
own
values
and
biases,
as
well.
Overall,
being
thrown
into
a
world
entirely
distinct
from
what
I
was
accustomed
to
fundamentally
influenced
my
character:
an
effect
that
is
directly
translated
into
my
writing.
In
addition,
immersion
into
a
culture
where
the
natives
speak
the
target
language
obviously
was
optimal
for
the
richening
and
refinement
of
my
Spanish.
In
hindsight,
I
find
it
remarkable
how
quickly
and
effortlessly
my
communication
skills
developed
and
matured
as
a
result
of
being
constantly
surrounded
with
and
obligated
to
speak
the
tongue.
At
times,
this
was
obviously
more
frustrating
than
fulfilling.
No
matter
how
sophisticated
my
speech
in
Spanish
became,
the
inability
to
fully
express
myself
was
a
great
source
of
aggravation.
After
a
long
day,
I
sometimes
yearned
to
openly
confide
in
someone,
without
the
impediments
of
a
limited
vocabulary
holding
me
back.
Yet
my
successes
and
struggles
sum
up
to
a
greater
ability
to
identify
with
the
students
I
see
as
a
Writing
Associate
at
Lafayette
College.
With
their
blossoming
language
skills,
I
can
act
as
more
than
just
a
sounding
board
for
ideas,
organization
and
grammar.
Empathizing
with
the
struggles
the
students
face
to
grasp
the
subjunctive
tense,
or
relating
to
their
irritation
with
the
long
list
of
irregular
verbs,
we
can
literally
and
figuratively
Nspeak
the
same
language.O
The
best
part
about
this
relationship
with
my
students
is
its
reciprocal
nature.
The
journey
towards
becoming
a
better
writer
in
any
language
is
an
infinite
path,
best
traveled
with
company.
Personally,
the
next
challenge
I
am
faced
with
on
this
trail
is
my
Senior
Spanish
Thesis.
Over
the
last
couple
of
weeks,
I
have
found
the
greatest
resource
to
this
endeavor
not
isolated
and
huddled
over
a
heap
of
books
in
the
basement
of
Skillman
Library,
but
in
the
W.A.
meetings
I
hold
with
my
students.
Laboring
through
papers
together,
our
interaction
may
not
find
me
the
literary
sources
I
need,
but
it
does
provide
me
with
a
confidence
in
my
ability
and
a
constant
reminder
of
how
to
approach
and
revise
good
writing.
Clearly,
I
have
come
a
long
way
from
that
terrified
young
girl
who
may
as
well
have
been
a
mute
at
the
Ayala
dinner
table.
To
begin
with,
I
no
longer
smile
and
nod
in
utter
bewilderment
as
others
speedily
chatter
my
presence
away.
Gone
is
that
invisibility
cloak
that
I
clung
to
like
a
security
blanket.
Confident
and
poised,
my
experiences
over
the
last
couple
years
have
given
me
an
assertiveness
and
tenacity
that
extend
far
beyond
my
linguistic
skills.
By
means
of
my
struggles
with
Spanish
and
my
time
spent
abroad,
I
developed
a
greater
love
for
the
language
as
well
as
myself.
