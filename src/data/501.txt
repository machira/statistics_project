I
suspect
I
would
not
be
able
to
make
a
career
out
of
writing.
I
am
not
able
to
sit
down
and
write
without
pause
because
I
am
too
much
of
a
perfectionist.
This
is
one
of
my
greatest
flaws
as
a
writer,
the
fact
that
I
revise
grammar
and
sentences
as
I
write,
disturbing
the
meditation
of
the
exercise
mi
should
I
end
the
sentence
here
or
add
a
conjunction?
Is
memeditationmo
the
best
word
to
use
in
this
context?
Is
a
dash
or
a
semicolon
the
proper
punctuation?
This
continuous
revision
can
be
exhausting
at
times.
Everyone
knows,
or
at
least
many
people
are
taught,
that
the
best
way
to
write
is
to
start
writing
and
continue
until
finished,
then
return
and
edit.
So
how
can
I
be
expected
to
act
as
an
informed
reader,
review
someone
elseyus
work,
and
guide
him
in
his
own
writing
process
without
using
my
own
agenda
as
a
lesson
plan?
By
realizing
that
writing
must
mature
as
well
as
the
writer,
finding
the
tools
necessary
to
be
a
good
writer,
and
by
accepting
that
the
purpose
of
writing
isnyut
to
impress
the
reader
but
to
inform
and
practice,
I
have
become
a
writer
well-versed
in
the
process
through
my
own
education
and
experience.
My
education
and
experience
as
an
adolescent
in
Oregon
gave
me
tools
to
use
early
in
my
writing
career,
even
if
under-developed.
In
Oregon
all
public
schools
participate
in
a
mandatory
program
called
CIM
for
Certificate
of
Initial
Mastery.
Beginning
in
the
third
grade,
and
practicing
even
earlier,
students
are
tested
to
meet
the
standards
of
CIM
in
reading,
writing,
science,
and
math.
What
is
peculiar
about
the
math
subject
test
was
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
detailed
essay
explaining
the
studentyus
reasoning.
Knowing
how
to
clearly
and
correctly
explain
oneyus
self
is
the
goal
of
these
math
problems;
a
correct
answer
will
only
gain
the
top
score
in
one
category,
accuracy.
Other
categories
such
as
verification,
organization,
and
explanation
are
also
used
to
score
the
studentyus
answer.
In
writing,
students
are
scored
on
a
scale
of
one
through
six
in
six
categories:
voice,
word
choice,
sentence
fluency,
ideas
and
content,
organization,
and
punctuation.
A
score
of
thirty-six
is
equivalent
to
a
perfect
score
on
the
SATs.
I
almost
always
received
a
six
in
word
choice,
sentence
fluency,
and
punctuation,
but
less
frequently
in
voice,
ideas
and
content,
and
organization.
These
would
continue
to
elude
me
not
a
short
while
even
though
I
tried
to
fabricate
them
in
my
eagerness.
Early
on,
we
learned
what
criteria
exceeded
standards,
what
met
standards,
and
what
failed
to
meet
the
standards.
No
one
was
fond
of
this
nutrition-triangle
program,
especially
when
one
was
force-fed
it
through
hours
of
in-class
writing
inspired
by
a
list
of
three
prompts.
Writing
was
separated
into
five
genres
of
descriptive,
narrative,
persuasive,
expositive,
and
speech.
In
third
grade,
I
discovered
my
strength
was
in
the
description
of
ideas,
not
in
the
presentation
of
them.
I
was
rewarded
for
my
adjectives
with
three
scores
of
six
and
three
scores
of
five
on
my
story
about
Christmas
morning.
I
tried
to
reproduce
this
success
the
next
year
by
recreating
the
images
and
sentences
I
had
used
the
previous
year
from
memory,
thinking
that
I
had
discovered
what
the
object
of
writing
was,
and
all
that
was
asked
of
me
was
to
manufacture
these
structures
and
adjectives
with
little
variance.
This
theory
was
disproved,
however,
as
I
met
with
little
recognition
for
my
reproduction
and
did
not
receive
a
single
six.
After
receiving
my
humbling
scores
of
fives
and
fours,
I
resolved
to
be
as
outlandish
as
possible
with
my
metaphors
and
similes,
as
fresh
and
creative
as
possible
with
my
plots,
and
as
descriptive
and
eloquent
as
possible
with
my
adjectives.
This
method
seemed
to
please
my
teachers
who
praised
my
descriptive
ability,
which
was
largely
a
result
of
mimicking
what
I
had
read
in
books;
there
was
not
much
creative
talent
or
initiative
involved.
I
soon
came
to
realize,
however,
that
fancy
words
are
not
a
substitute
for
freshness
or
originality,
but
instead
a
short-cut
that
cost
me
a
speedy
development
in
my
writing.
The
pattern
of
a
five-paragraph
essay,
the
summary
of
a
topic
and
conclusion
sentence,
the
suggestion
of
the
introductory
and
conclusion
paragraph,
and
the
proposal
of
a
theme
were
tools
and
techniques
clearly
introduced
in
Seventh-grade
English
class.
At
last,
we
were
assigned
the
abhorred
persuasive
paper
and
were
expected
to
use
the
books
with
the
numbers
on
the
binding
instead
of
the
meFmo
for
fiction.
Poetry
was
explored
and
books
were
picked
at
and
analyzed
in
search
of
fodder
for
this
new
expectation:
we
were
supposed
to
write.
Not
cheesy
stories
about
our
first
day
of
school,
either,
but
analytical,
comprehensive
works
of
complete
sentences.
Writing
was
succored
with
reading,
and
everything
was
now
literary.
We
were
little
spider
monkeys,
grooming
literature
for
the
easily
recognizable
themes
and
skimming
our
fingers
across
the
pages
to
pick
out
the
elusive
motifs
and
symbolism
that
were
tastier
for
their
mysticism.
In
eighth
grade,
a
tree
stump
was
no
longer
a
tree
stump,
but
some
indelible
force
to
be
reckoned
with
and
written
about.
Now,
we
were
expected
to
find
similarities
between
what
we
read
and
what
we
saw
in
the
world
and
write
about
it.
It
was
an
exercise
in
struggling
to
find
meaning
in
life
and
in
words
which
we
untried
juveniles
either
found
to
be
intriguing
or
a
waste
of
time.
I
recognized
the
importance
to
my
teachers
of
what
I
was
learning
and
did
my
utmost
to
conform
to
these
new
parameters
mi
one
cannot
use
loom
if
one
does
not
have
the
correct
thread.
I
found
the
most
ease
in
making
connections
between
ideas,
motifs,
or
symbolism
of
literature
and
the
themes
of
culture,
reoccurring
motifs
of
history,
and
the
symbolism
of
current
events.
I
was
once
spotlighted
by
my
eighth-grade
teacher
for
my
comparison
of
Joan
of
Arc
and
some
character
in
a
poem.
The
most
difficult
part
was
in
knowing
enough
about
society,
history,
current
events
and
culture
to
keep
making
these
brilliant
comparisons
without
using
the
same
idea
for
lack
of
better
material.
This
is
how
I
learned
that
in
order
to
write
something
worthwhile,
an
omniscient
knowledge
of
all
subjects
was
ideal,
but
a
cursory
education
in
the
history
of
the
topic
to
be
written
about
would
suffice.
References
not
only
support
the
argument,
but
enrich
both
the
writer
and
the
audience.
Yet,
similar
in
nature
to
similes
and
metaphors,
references,
too,
become
dull
with
overuse
if
not
used
sparingly
and
with
discretion.
Throughout
elementary
and
middle
school,
each
teacher
had
given
me
tools
to
use
in
writing,
whether
in
reasoning,
analysis,
structure,
or
creativity.
As
I
would
find,
these
instruments
were
not
a
means
to
an
end,
but
on
the
contrary,
skills
I
would
need
to
continue
to
build
my
writing.
Through
the
transition
from
middle
school
to
high
school,
and
again
from
high
school
to
college,
I
became
cognizant
of
one
of
the
most
important
factors
in
writing,
the
audience.
Whether
a
teacher,
a
peer,
or
a
parent,
I
aimed
for
her
pleasure
in
my
writing,
and
thought
that
astounding
them
with
clever
words
and
subtle
phrase
the
most
apt
way
of
succeeding.
Having
found
the
difficulty
in
keeping
up
that
charade,
I
now
aim
for
communication
and
clarity,
even
if
with
the
most
hesitantly
praiseful
of
audience
members,
myself
The
next
four
years
of
high
school
I
would
spend
struggling
with
one
particular
concept
which
I
now
seek
to
avoid
every
time
I
wish
to
write.
My
freshman
English
teacher
termed
my
nemesis
overwriting.
I
can
now
recognize
when
I
become
zealous
with
my
writing,
especially
with
lofty-sounding
words,
but
as
a
naFu
e
writer
I
thought
that
the
most
profound
phrases
were
the
ones
hardest
to
understand.
Neither
was
this
barometer
restricted
to
my
structure
of
writing.
I
prided
myself
on
choosing
difficult
or
controversial
topics
to
write
about:
global
warming,
overpopulation,
or
substance
legalization.
Global
warming
was
the
subject
of
my
first
persuasive
speech,
its
existence
and
prevention
my
thesis.
My
first
expositive
speech
was
on
overpopulation,
where
I
was
introduced
to
parallelism,
one
of
the
techniques
I
use
often
as
an
effective
and
clear
way
to
make
a
point.
Still,
I
have
learned
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
overuse,
even
if
I
was
nearly
devastated
at
first
when
I
was
told
unceremoniously
that
my
technique
was
too
unclear,
too
complex,
and
what
I
interpreted
as
too
prosaic.
In
one
short
meeting
on
what
I
thought
was
a
satisfactorily
complex
paper
in
subject
and
structure,
I
was
told
to
rewrite,
something
I
had
never
before
had
cause
to
do
unless
I
had
thought
of
something
of
better.
Now
I
was
told
that
my
best
was
not
the
best
that
I
could
do.
Taking
this
criticism
and
making
it
into
something
positive
was
a
hard-earned
and
time-consuming
principle
of
writing.
The
jolt
was
softened
by
a
slow
realization
that
the
purpose
of
writing
was
not
to
compete
with
the
reader
in
an
ostentatious
use
of
words
or
ideas,
for
this
only
succeeds
in
distancing
the
writer
from
the
audience.
Another
teacher
of
mine
taught
us
the
pneumonic
device,
KISS
(
Keep
It
Short
and
Succinct
).
The
best
way
to
communicate
is
often
the
most
direct
and
shortest
way
mi
why
use
three
words
when
one
word
can
substitute?
In
order
to
persuade
the
reader
to
believe
or
think
as
the
writer
does,
even
if
temporarily,
the
writer
and
reader
must
be
able
to
understand
one
another
so
that
information
can
be
exchanged.
Writing
is
no
different
than
speaking
or
thinking.
Like
speaking,
writing
is
a
form
of
communication
of
ideas,
and
like
thinking,
it
requires
the
formation
of
thoughts
in
some
sort
of
pattern
to
reach
an
idea.
Writing
is
merely
the
formality.
Each
personyus
ability
is
unique,
like
a
fingerprint
or
voice,
because
writing
involves
an
individualyus
perception,
language,
and
pattern.
A
good
writer
uses
all
three
to
lure
people
to
understand
his
idea.
Again,
parallel
to
speech
and
thought,
writing
improves
with
age,
education,
experience,
and
practice,
reflecting
oneyus
language
and
philosophy.
What
I
have
always
cherished
about
writing
is
its
flexibility
and
versatility.
If
thought
was
bustling
New
York
City
and
speech
was
political
Washington
D.C.,
then
writing
would
be
San
Francisco,
shaped
by
steep
inclines
and
declines
but
home
to
all
manner
of
people
and
ideas.
Writing
is
the
tune
of
the
music,
the
pattern
of
the
quilt,
and
the
shape
of
the
sculpture.
A
person
is
capturing
a
thought,
a
story,
or
an
idea
in
a
tangible
item
that
can
be
studied
and
stored,
a
commodity
that
even
philosophers
and
sophists
make
use
of.
The
process
of
choosing
the
words
to
christen
our
thoughts
and
speech,
however,
defines
how
and
why
we
write.
How
one
writes
is
usually
difficult
to
depict
because
it
isnyut
altogether
a
conscious
act.
While
how
one
thinks
as
they
write
is
nearly
indecipherable,
I
can
say
that
I
will
only
write
on
a
computer.
Writing
manually,
I
would
have
to
write
so
fast
to
keep
pace
with
my
thinking
that
my
writing
would
become
illegible
and
my
hand
cramped
or
I
would
have
to
wait
for
my
pen
to
make
the
curves
of
the
letters
so
long
that
I
would
lose
my
thought
while
I
was
dotting
my
i.
Typing
is
so
much
more
loose
and
rapid
with
the
audible
sound
of
the
keys.
Any
time
I
was
forced
to
write
with
pen
on
paper,
I
felt
stymied
by
the
inability
to
make
immediate
corrections,
move
a
sentence
to
another
location
with
the
click
of
a
button,
copy
and
paste,
or
have
uniform
lettering
and
punctuation.
Because
of
its
timeliness
and
conduciveness
to
revision,
the
computer
is
my
instrument
of
choice
when
writing.
I
have
always
written
as
an
assignment.
I
find
the
challenge
of
meeting
someone
elseyus
standards
daunting
enough
without
trying
to
satisfy
my
own
much
loftier
expectations.
Teachers
have
made
the
noncommittal
comments
on
my
papers,
such
as
the
all-encompassing
megoodmo
or
menice
point,mo
but
each
red
mark
was
specific
to
the
writing,
not
the
writer.
I
have
been
told
I
am
a
good
writer,
but
never
why
anyone
thought
so.
This
made
it
easier
to
ignore
the
comments
entirely,
using
my
own
sense
of
good
writing
to
judge
myself.
Perversely,
this
made
it
harder
when
anyone
would
judge
my
writing.
I
found
that
as
I
progressed
through
high
school,
teachers
became
more
interested
in
what
I
wrote
about,
not
how
I
wrote.
As
long
as
the
student
could
write
decently
the
score
at
the
top
of
the
paper
would
most
likely
be
an
indicator
of
the
studentyus
interpretation
with
extra
points
given
for
originality
and
logic.
Of
course,
a
paper
was
more
convincing
if
it
was
clear
and
authoritative.
From
reading
other
writing,
I
concluded
that
writing
clearly
lent
itself
to
writing
authoritatively,
because
a
point
made
clearly
carries
authority,
and
so
I
usually
managed
to
convince
my
teachers
to
give
me
a
high
score
at
the
top
of
my
paper.
Revision
is
not
a
singular
step,
but
a
continual
process
I
use
even
while
brainstorming.
The
succession
from
thesis
to
outline
to
draft,
to
final
copy
is
linked
by
revision
and
augmentation.
Most
often,
I
find
even
the
structure
of
an
outline
hinders
my
concentration.
As
I
write
what
the
words
lead
me
to
say,
I
find
that
I
must
return
to
alter
my
thesis
or
supporting
paragraphs
because
I
have
realized
that
writing
is
the
best
act
to
perform
in
order
to
inform
myself
of
what
it
is
I
actually
think.
Writing
with
intent
is
necessary
when
there
is
a
specific
point
that
must
be
made
and
a
course
that
must
be
followed,
but
when
the
writing
is
open-ended,
the
intent
is
on
writing.
Writing,
whether
expositive
or
instructional,
is
much
more
impressive
than
the
intent
to
impress.
Since
I
have
entered
college,
peer-review
has
become
more
valuable
and
necessary
to
ensure
a
piece
of
writing
that
fulfills
its
intention
with
clarity.
Experience
with
the
success
and
mistakes
of
maturity,
the
usefulness
and
hindrance
of
tools,
and
the
cause
and
effects
of
purpose
allow
my
writing
to
serve
as
a
precursor
to
my
understanding
of
the
writing
of
others.
If
this
should
be
able
to
help
my
peers
become
better
writers
or
reviewers
then
I
will
consider
the
arduous
task
well
worth
the
effort.
