Veteran
WA
Literacy
Narrative
Fall
2007
After
finishing
my
junior
year
at
Lafayette
College
this
past
May,
I
admit
that
I
initially
gave
little
thought
to
my
growth
over
the
year.
I
was
happy
to
have
finished
finals
and
begin
my
summer
internships.
It
wasnOt
until
I
received
the
new
Literacy
Narrative
assignment
that
I
began
to
reflect
on
how
my
most
recent
writing
experiences,
in
addition
to
my
early
history
as
a
writer,
have
truly
influenced
me.
These
experiences
not
only
improved
my
writing,
but
have
also
enhanced
my
skill
in
helping
others
with
their
own
writing.
As
I
sit
to
write
this
narrative,
I
am
overwhelmed
by
the
realization
that
I
have
learned
so
much
about
myself
as
a
writer
simply
by
helping
others
in
my
role
as
a
WA.
I
am
extremely
grateful
for
this
newly
acquired
knowledge.
It
is
my
ultimate
goal
to
have
this
Literacy
Narrative
addendum
serve
two
purposes:
to
document
my
growth
over
the
past
year
as
a
result
of
my
WA,
writing,
and
summer
experiences,
and,
most
importantly,
to
pass
on
some
NWA
WisdomO
to
the
new
WAs
that
are
joining
the
program
for
the
Fall
2007
semester.
As
I
look
back
on
my
initial
literacy
narrative,
I
couldnOt
help
being
drawn
to
the
section
in
which
I
discuss
my
immersion
in
poetry
during
8th
grade.
That
experience
not
only
helped
me
unleash
my
own
creativity,
but
it
gave
me
the
necessary
tools
to
analyze
and
truly
appreciate
creative
work.
Although
I
took
a
few
NcreativeO
courses
during
high
school
and
college
(section
of
the
College
Writing
course
geared
toward
creativity),
I
never
experienced
a
course
that
truly
looked
at
poets
and
the
work
in
depth
until
the
fall
2006
semester
when
I
took
the
course
NWriters
in
Focus:
Plath
and
Dickinson.O
I
was
immersed
in
creative
work
once
again
during
this
course
and
I
was
delighted
to
experience
the
same
fulfillment
that
I
found
while
taking
courses
on
poetry
in
middle
school
and
high
school.
This
course
helped
me
to
analyze
the
creative
work
of
both
authors,
gave
me
more
practice
with
peer
editing,
and
gave
me
more
of
the
tools
necessary
to
appreciate
poetry
yet
look
at
it
with
a
critical
eye.
I
learned
how
an
authorOs
biographical
information
could
provide
useful
information
about
a
specific
creative
piece.
I
also
learned
about
the
styles
of
both
Sylvia
Plath
and
Emily
Dickinson
by
creating
my
own
poems
that
purposely
imitated
some
of
their
techniques.
This
reinforced
a
lot
of
things
that
I
have
learned
about
college
level
writing
such
as
the
fact
that
in
order
to
learn,
it
is
sometimes
necessary
to
imitate
the
style
of
established
authorities
in
the
field.
David
Bartholomae
suggests
this
in
his
piece
NInventing
the
University.O
Although
I
read
this
piece
for
the
WA
workshop
in
fall
2006
and
am
currently
re-reading
it
for
the
fall
2007workshop,
I
donOt
know
if
I
actually
believed
the
message
until
after
finishing
the
Plath
and
Dickinson
course
and
imitating
writers
myself.
Many
argue
that
Sylvia
Plath
began
her
career
by
imitating
other
poets
and
that
she
didnOt
develop
the
unique
voice
that
she
is
famous
for
until
later
in
her
career.
My
experiences
with
poetry
and
other
forms
of
creative
writing
extended
into
this
summer,
and
I
like
to
think
that
I
put
my
WA
skills
to
good
use.
For
three
weeks
at
the
end
of
June/beginning
of
July,
I
worked
as
a
Teaching
Assistant
for
a
course
called
NWriting
and
ImaginationO
through
the
JohnOs
Hopkins
Center
for
Talented
Youth
Summer
Programs
(JHU-CTY).
I
worked
with
gifted
6th
graders
and
helped
teach
them
various
elements
of
creative
writing
from
poetry
to
short
stories.
Perhaps
my
favorite
part
about
this
experience
was
helping
the
students
with
editing
and
group
workshops.
For
example,
after
each
lesson
on
a
poetry
device,
the
students
would
create
an
original
piece
using
that
specific
device.
They
would
then
workshop
their
poem
with
their
peers
in
small
groups.
Explaining
and
supervising
the
peer
editing
process
served
as
reinforcement
of
my
knowledge
and
will
prove
to
be
beneficial
for
my
own
writing
as
well
as
for
when
I
am
editing
the
writing
of
others.
Throughout
working
with
college
students
during
the
year
and
then
working
with
younger
students
during
the
summer
I
realized
that
peer
editing
contains
universal
elements.
The
basis
of
peer
editing
is
the
same
regardless
of
the
ages
of
those
involved,
which
brings
me
to
WA
Wisdom
#1:
It
is
all
about
Psychology.
Yes,
I
might
be
biased
because
I
am
a
Psychology
and
English
double
major,
but
it
is
necessary
to
pay
attention
to
the
feelings
and
reactions
of
the
person
you
are
conferencing
with
in
order
to
have
a
successful
conference.
It
is
essential
to
be
mindful
of
the
way
suggestions
are
framed
so
as
to
not
hurt
any
feelings.
I
find
myself
telling
students,
both
college
age
and
middle
school
age,
the
good
things
about
their
work
first.
I
tell
them
what
I
like
and
what
I
think
works
very
well
and
then
move
onto
areas
that
could
use
some
improvement.
Also,
I
make
sure
to
show
them
exactly
how
and
why
something
doesnOt
work
and
give
them
suggestions
for
how
to
fix
it
instead
of
just
saying
that
it
doesnOt
work
and
leaving
it
at
that.
The
hardest
part
about
this
is
not
actually
giving
the
students
the
answer
or
writing
the
sentence
for
them.
I
try
to
pose
questions
that
lead
students
to
come
up
with
the
corrections
on
their
own.
As
I
have
learned,
this
is
where
the
importance
of
Psychology
comes
in
again.
Because
each
student
is
different,
they
will
respond
to
conferences
in
many
different
ways.
Some
will
just
take
in
everything
you
say
and
agree
with
it
all,
others
will
act
apathetic,
some
will
be
the
NperfectO
student
and
really
work
collaboratively
with
you,
and
others
will
be
resistant
to
any
advice.
IOve
learned
that
it
is
beneficial
to
identify
what
NtypeO
of
student
you
are
working
with
in
order
to
tailor
your
conferencing
style
to
that
student.
The
apathetic
students
are
more
likely
to
not
want
to
engage
in
a
collaborative
discussion
about
their
work
and
will
be
reluctant
to
respond
to
your
helpful
questioning.
Although
the
collaborative
approach
is
preferred,
it
does
not
work
with
everyone
and
sometimes
you
will
have
to
settle
for
just
going
through
studentsO
papers
with
them
and
listing
all
of
your
comments.
Without
a
doubt,
collaborative
conferences
are
the
most
rewarding
for
me
as
a
WA.
One
college
student
this
past
spring
had
a
tough
time
figuring
out
what
she
wanted
to
say
about
her
VAST
paper
topic.
I
asked,
NDo
you
believe
that
Robert
Moses
and
his
construction
plans
benefited
New
York
City,
or
did
they
actually
harm
the
various
communities?O
She
said,
NWell,
I
think
that
he
made
everything
worse
and
caused
a
disaster.O
I
said,
NOkay,
well
in
what
ways
were
his
construction
projects
disastrous?O
She
then
began
to
list
various
ways
and
I
jotted
them
down.
I
showed
her
the
list
afterward
and
explained
that
all
of
these
things
could
be
main
points
in
her
paper
if
she
provided
enough
evidence
for
them,
and
that
she
could
organize
her
paper
using
these
main
points.
By
doing
this,
I
encouraged
her
to
come
up
with
ideas
independently
and
gained
the
confidence
to
do
so.
I
saw
similar
improvement
with
the
middle
school
children.
If
someone
asked
me
about
my
approach
to
peer
editing
at
the
end
of
this
past
school
year
I
wouldnOt
have
been
able
to
give
an
organized
answer.
The
fact
is
that
teaching
the
middle
school
students
how
to
workshop
and
peer
edit
helped
me
solidify
the
steps
in
my
own
mind.
Reminding
them
to
mention
positive
things
first,
give
specific
suggestions
for
improvement,
and
not
take
over
the
work
and
re-write
for
their
peers
helped
me
to
remember
to
do
these
things
as
well.
I
am
now
prepared
for
and
am
looking
forward
to
the
possibility
that
new
WAs
may
ask
me
questions
about
how
to
approach
their
first
conference!
My
summer
experience
at
JHU-CTY
not
only
helped
me
with
the
peer
aspect
of
conferencing
and
editing,
but
also
gave
practice
in
working
collaboratively
with
an
instructor/professor.
My
relationship
with
the
CTY
course
instructor
was
much
like
my
relationship
with
my
assigned
professor
as
a
WA.
I
had
to
be
clear
on
the
instructorOs
expectations
in
order
to
help
the
students
meet
those
expectations
and
I
also
had
to
know
how
exactly
he
wanted
me
to
work
with
the
students.
This
brings
me
to
WA
Wisdom
#2:
keep
the
lines
open.
When
assigned
to
a
professor
and
course
as
a
WA,
I
have
learned
that
it
is
easier
to
start
the
communication
right
away.
These
lines
of
communication
are
absolutely
necessary
and
the
job
of
a
WA
is
much
easier
if
the
lines
are
established
quickly
and
solidly.
WA
responsibilities
include
demonstrating
your
availability
to
help,
as
well
as
trying
your
best
to
seek
out
your
assigned
professor
to
and
get
the
communication
going
(even
if
the
professor
is
hard
to
find!).
During
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
I
thought
that
good
lines
of
communication
were
of
benefit
only
to
me
and
the
professor.
This
thinking
lead
to
initial
success
up
until
a
communication
breakdown
occurred.
The
professor
and
I
started
meeting
less
frequently
to
discuss
progress.
As
a
result,
the
professor
would
forget
to
inform
me
about
syllabus
and
assignment
requirement
changes.
Because
of
this
I
ended
up
inadvertently
giving
the
students
different
information
than
the
professor
was
giving
them
which
resulted
in
confusion
overall.
After
this
experience,
I
realized
that
I,
as
a
WA,
am
basically
the
liaison
between
the
professor
and
the
students.
Professors
rely
on
WAs
to
explain
things
to
students
if
they
need
it,
and
the
students
sometimes
use
the
WA
to
communicate
their
uncertainties
about
assignments.
This
definitely
helped
me
in
my
own
writing
as
I
noticed
myself
going
to
more
office
hours
in
the
spring
than
I
had
during
any
other
semester
at
Lafayette.
I
began
to
establish
good
communication
with
all
of
my
professors
and
am
not
the
slightest
bit
afraid
to
ask
any
questions.
I
have
been
focusing
largely
on
how
my
past
experiences
have
helped
me
with
my
WA
responsibilities.
However,
my
experiences
this
year
and
over
the
summer
have
also
contributed
to
the
development
of
my
own
writing
process.
To
my
surprise,
I
have
gained
a
new
found
love
and
respect
for
the
revision
process
beginning
during
the
NWriters
in
FocusO
course
during
the
fall
2006
semester.
The
professor
of
this
course
helped
me
to
realize
that
no
work
of
literature
is
every
truly
finished,
whether
it
be
a
creative
piece
or
a
literary
analysis.
I
remember
submitting
each
paper
at
least
twice
during
the
course
of
the
semester
after
revising
multiple
times,
and
the
professor
welcomed
these
re-submittals.
I
learned
that
sometimes
the
best
thing
to
do
is
put
a
piece
that
I
am
working
on
away
for
awhile
and
then
come
back
to
it
with
Nfresh
eyesO
at
a
later
date.
In
doing
so,
I
realize
more
areas
that
could
use
revision.
I
tried
to
reinforce
this
strategy
as
a
TA
for
CTY
this
summer
since
it
provided
me
with
success.
Although
the
students
only
wrote
short
work
such
as
poetry
and
short
stories
(and
only
had
3
weeks
in
the
program),
I
would
have
them
put
away
their
work
after
the
morning
class
session
and
come
back
to
it
in
the
late
afternoon
session
or
even
the
next
morning
session.
I
would
say,
NOkay,
time
for
fresh
eyes.
Take
out
your
poem,
read
it
over,
and
see
if
you
can
add/change
anything.O
This
brings
me
to
WA
Wisdom
#3:
learn
from
your
work
as
a
WA.
Seeing
the
revision
process
constantly
in
action
and
helping
others
with
this
process
definitely
helped
me
become
a
better
writer.
I
have
seen
the
vast
improvements
achieved
when
students
take
the
time
to
go
through
the
process
and
really
put
thought
into
their
revision
work.
I
have
also
seen
the
disappointments.
Some
students
have
papers
with
so
much
potential,
but
that
potential
is
never
realized
due
to
the
fact
that
they
neglect
the
revision
process.
I
try
hard
to
encourage
these
students
to
take
the
time
and
revise,
but
the
motivation
ultimately
comes
from
within.
My
worst
moments
as
a
WA
came
when
I
realized
that
students
could
achieve
so
much
more
if
they
only
put
the
time
into
it.
This
has
affected
me
greatly
as
a
writer.
I
no
longer
let
myself
procrastinate,
and
I
make
sure
to
devote
an
adequate
amount
of
time
to
the
revision
process.
Although
procrastinating
doesnOt
mean
that
an
assignment
wonOt
get
completed,
it
does
mean
that
the
quality
of
the
assignment
will
suffer.
This
ultimately
leads
me
into
WA
Wisdom
#4:
learn
from
other
WAs.
Throughout
the
year
I
have
definitely
realized
the
importance
and
benefits
of
asking
other
more
experienced
WAs
for
advice.
I
had
a
few
difficult
situations
with
students
and
asked
other
WAs
how
I
should
approach
the
problem.
For
example,
one
student
repeatedly
missed
conferences
and
I
was
always
open
to
rescheduling.
However,
it
got
to
the
point
where
the
student
would
miss
the
rescheduled
conferences
and
I
ended
up
wasting
a
significant
amount
of
my
time.
I
expressed
my
frustration
to
a
few
other
WAs
in
the
writing
room
that
evening
and
they
suggested
that
I
email
the
professor
about
the
problem.
They
also
gave
me
suggestions
about
how
to
talk
to
the
student
to
let
him
know
that
I
will
not
be
able
to
reschedule
any
more.
I
spoke
with
both
the
professor
and
the
student.
Although
the
student
ended
up
not
showing
up
for
the
rest
of
the
semester,
I
was
grateful
that
the
experienced
WAs
were
so
willing
to
give
me
much
needed
advice.
I
also
followed
the
advice
of
more
experienced
WAs
in
other,
happier,
situations.
I
observed
one
WA
creating
a
list
of
what
she
wanted
to
cover
in
her
conference
on
a
separate
sheet
of
paper
(instead
of
just
marking
all
over
the
studentOs
paper)
and
it
seemed
to
work
really
well.
I
tried
that
in
my
next
conference
and
met
with
similar
success.
I
learned
that
peers
(or
co-workers
in
this
case)
are
a
very
valuable
resource
in
multiple
types
of
situations.
The
last
aspect
of
my
growth
over
the
year
that
I
wish
to
touch
on
is
my
new
appreciation
for
various
forms
of
academic
writing.
I
always
struggled
with
the
gap
between
writing
for
my
English
classes
and
writing
for
my
Psychology
classes.
The
styles
are
completely
different,
and
I
was
completely
resistant
to
that
up
until
this
year.
I
wrote
my
Psychology
Lab
reports
in
the
same
style
that
I
would
write
a
Literary
Analysis.
This
spring
however,
I
felt
like
I
learned
how
to
write
for
different
academic
audiences
for
the
first
time.
I
realized
that
I
needed
to
spend
a
lot
more
time
on
Lab
reports
then
I
allowed
myself
previously
in
order
to
master
the
art
of
NscientificO
writing
(learning
how
to
be
more
concise).
I
learned
to
write
the
various
sections
of
my
lab
reports
right
away
as
soon
as
I
had
the
information
for
them
instead
of
waiting
awhile
and
relying
on
my
class
notes
which
definitely
helped
with
my
organization
and
flow.
My
appreciation
for
different
forms
of
academic
writing
was
also
enhanced
through
staffing
WA
Drop-In.
I
saw
many
different
types
of
academic
writing
during
Drop-In,
from
Lab
reports,
to
journalistic
writing,
to
graduate
school
personal
statements.
I
learned
to
respect
the
styles
of
different
academic
disciplines
and
to
focus
on
the
universals
of
editing
such
as
clarity
of
argument,
logical
presentation/order
of
ideas,
adequate
support/evidence,
organization,
and
even
grammar.
As
I
look
back
on
the
year
I
find
the
amount
that
I
learned
to
be
incredible.
If
you
asked
me
in
May
about
working
with
younger
students,
I
would
have
never
thought
that
it
would
be
anything
similar
to
working
with
college
students.
Yet,
I
discovered
that
there
are
universal
facets
to
the
editing
process.
Through
teaching
others
I
have
actually
learned
more
about
the
subject
matter.
Through
writing
this
addendum
to
my
Literacy
Narrative
I
have
learned
that
all
of
my
experiences
throughout
my
writing
history
are
linked.
My
experiences
over
the
past
year
have
all
been
complimentary
to
one
another,
and
each
has
served
to
improve
my
writing,
my
understanding
of
my
writing
process,
as
well
as
my
skills
as
a
Writing
Associate.
As
I
prepare
to
enter
my
senior
year
at
Lafayette
College
I
feel
more
prepared
then
ever
before
to
resume
my
position
as
a
WA
and
as
a
writer,
and
I
look
forward
to
helping
new
Writing
Associates
in
any
way
that
I
can.
