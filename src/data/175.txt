WA
Workshop
August
28,
1998
When
thinking
about
my
writing
of
the
past
year,
automatically
(probably
because
I
declared
myself
an
English
major
at
the
end
of
the
recent
semester
and
due
to
my
WA
experience)
I
thought
of
the
papers
I
wrote
for
my
English
classes.
I
then
realized
that
out
of
the
three
English
courses
I
took
this
year,
two
were
survey
classes;
neither
class
required
me
to
write
more
than
one
paper.
Immediately
I
discovered
that,
unlike
past
years,
the
majority
of
my
writing
was
for
school-required
courses
or
electives
that
weren't
in
my
major.
Writing
in
courses
such
as
Business
Ethics,
Women's
Studies,
and
a
scientific
research-based
VAST
course
forced
me
to
broaden
my
writing
experiences
from
mainly
literary
responses
and
criticisms
to
free-writing
exercises,
creative
writing,
lab
reports,
and
journals.
Overall,
this
shift
in
writing
assignments
taught
me
to
ioosen
up'
from
the
writing
style
and
'rules'
I
had
been
accustomed
to
using,
and
realize
that
good
or
successful
writing
need
not
always
be
academic,
formal,
or
analytical.
I
discuss
the
shift
in
my
writing
abilities
as
if
the
process
of
finding
new
approaches
to
writing
was
easy.
It
was
not
at
all.
At
first,
I
was
reluctant
to
stray
from
my
typical
writing
style
because
it
had
been
successful
for
me
in
the
past.
For
example,
in
my
Women's
Studies
class
I
had
to
write
daily
responses
to
various
essays
and
articles
in
a
graded
journal.
The
professor
wanted
the
students
to
briefly
summarize
the
theses
or
arguments
of
the
readings
and
then
to
personally
comment
in
agreement
or
disagreement
with,
to
question,
or
to
further
discuss
issues
from
the
readings.
I
found
it
easy
to
read
the
essays,
find
the
authors'
arguments,
and
discuss
issues
that
the
author
had
raised.
However,
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
let
go
of
the
conventions
of
formal
writing
that
I
was
used
to.
Frequently,
my
professor
would
comment
that
she
would
like
more
personal
feedback
and
my
opinions
about
the
issues
rather
than
simply
discussing
the
authors'
views.
Eventually,
little
by
little,
my
journal
writing
became
more
relaxed.
I
was
no
longer
afraid
to
offer
my
opinions
on
topics
such
as
welfare
and
housework,
to
share
personal
experiences
with
gender,
religion,
race,
or
class
differences,
or
to
blatantly
disagree
with
an
author's
view.
Instead
of
merely
writing
in
response
to
another
author's
writing,
I
found
that
my
journals
soon
became
more
personal
and
unique
about
my
beliefs
and
experiences.
My
writing
in
this
genre
improved
and
the
journal
entries
were
mine,
expressive
of
my
ideas
rather
than
simply
responding
to
ideas
of
others.
In
addition
to
gaining
more
experience
in
personalizing
my
writing,
this
year
I
found
more
opportunities
where
1
could
select
topics
on
which
to
write
essays.
Previously
I
had
found,
and
probably
in
the
future
I
will
find
still,
that
for
the
majority
of
my
writing
assignments
my
professors
had
chosen
the
topics
or
arguments
of
the
essays.
I
was
accustomed
to
writing
that
either
furthered
the
professor's
argument
with
my
supporting
references
or
I
would
find
faults
with
the
argument
and
develop
an
alternative
thesis.
This
year
in
my
required
VAST
course,
I
was
gi
ven
the
freedom
to
write
three
papers
about
subjects
relative
to
the
class,
but
that
were
of
particular
interest
to
me.
For
each
paper,
the
assignment
was
to
find
an
article
in
either
a
scientific
research-based
journal
or
in
a
non-scientific
source
such
as
the
National
Enquirer,
and
to
evaluate
the
article
based
on
the
scientific
method
and
the
proper
skeptical
approaches
we
had
studied
in
class.
I
loved
the
fact
that
I
could
write
a
'legitimate'
college
paper
that
scientifically
evaluated
claims
of
spontaneous
human
combustion!
I
wrote
my
other
papers
on
topics
such
as
the
debate
about
acupuncture
and
the
research
concerning
the
difference
in
learning
skills
and
self-esteem
of
young
boys
and
girls.
I
assumed
that
my
papers
for
this
course
would
be
boring
because
I
don't
have
much
interest
in
the
sciences,
and
because
I
assumed
that
scientific
writing
is
strict,
convoluted
with
'scientific'
jargon,
and
basically
dull.
I
was
more
than
surprised
when
I
ended
up
liking
my
papers
for
the
course
because
I
was
allowed
the
freedom
to
chose
my
own
topics
and
I
discovered
that
scientific
writing,
or
writing
about
scientific
subject
matter,
does
not
have
to
be
dull.
Another
experience
that
helped
to
improve
my
writing
ability
occurred
in
my
summer
class
which
was
a
cross-reference
class
between
Women's
Studies
and
English.
The
writing
for
this
course
was
daily
responses
about
the
novels
or
plays
we
had
just
read.
Although
in
the
beginning
of
the
course
the
professor
specific
questions
or
suggested
topics,
we
often
were
given
freedom
to
write
about
what
we
chose.
Again
I
initially
struggled
with
this
freedom
and
I
preferred
writing
the
responses
when
the
professor
gave
topic
suggestions.
However,
for
the
last
couple
of
papers
I
chose
to
challenge
myself
beyond
the
gains
that
I
had
made
in
journal
writing
and
choosing
topics
during
the
regular
school
year.
I
decided
to
try
creative
writing.
This
may
not
seem
like
an
extremely
adventurous
decision,
but
I
had
always
shied
away
from
creative
writing.
Besides
having
kept
a
diary
when
I
was
much
younger,
I
never
write
journals,
poems,
or
stories
for
myself.
For
one
of
the
assignments
I
assumed
the
identity
of
a
male
character
in
a
science
fiction
novel
about
humans
rescued
from
earth
and
taken
to
a
space
ship
by
aliens,
and
I
wrote
diary
entries
about
his
experiences
in
this
new
environment.
Writing
about
a
character
in
the
first
person
was
interesting
because
it
allowed
me
to
visualize
the
alien
creatures
and
a
drastically
different
environment
to
earth
and
to
imagine
and
describe
how
I
would
feel
in
the
same
situation.
For
my
next
creative
writing
assignment
in
response
to
a
novel
about
an
adopted
young
lesbian's
coming-of-age
experiences,
I
chose
to
be
the
woman
and
write
a
letter
to
her
birth
mother
about
her
experiences
growing
up,
in
college,
and
with
her
sexuality.
Again,
I
really
enjoyed
assuming
a
character's
identity
and
using
her
situations
as
the
vehicle
for
my
voice
to
express
how
I
would
act
or
feel
in
similar
situations.
Thus,
whereas
I
had
thought
creative
writing
to
be
an
intimidating
experience,
I
found
that
it
allowed
me
great
freedom
with
my
writing.
Overall,
in
this
past
year
I
think
my
writing
has
grown
because
I
have
been
given
more
freedom
to,
and
become
more
comfortable
with
my
ability
to,
stray
a
bit
from
conventional
academic
writing's
strict
theses
and
structures.
I
enjoyed
experimenting
with
different
subjects
and
genres
such
as
journal
writing,
writing
about
scientific
research,
and
creative
writing.
Although
I
am
still
more
comfortable
with
writing
formal
papers,
1
hope
that
this
coming
year
will
allow
me
to
gain
even
more
independence
in
my
writing.
My
growth
as
a
writer
was
definitely
attributable
to
my
experiences
as
a
Writing
Associate.
My
primary
concern
before
my
first
meetings
was
that
I
did
not
want
to
impose
on
other
writers
my
ideas
of
the
'proper'
steps
(the
steps
I
usually
take
in
my
writing)
when
writing
a
draft
or
what
constitutes
a
solidly
written
paper.
To
prevent
this,
I
mainly
looked
for
the
concerns
that
my
professor
felt
were
most
important
in
a
draft:
thesis,
structure,
and
clarity.
In
order
to
advise
the
students
without
telling
them
what
I
would
do
(which
they
would
often
ask
me)
I
found
it
most
helpful
to
have
them
identify
their
thesis
and
ask
how
they
went
about
organizing
the
paper.
First,
I
would
ask
the
student
what
point
or
general
idea
she
wished
to
get
across
to
the
reader.
After
the
response,
I
would
ask
her
to
show
me
the
thesis.
Often,
the
writer
would
realize
that
she
never
clearly
stated
the
purpose
of
the
paper.
She
would
then
work
on
a
solid,
concise
statement
that
would
give
the
paper
much
more
focus,
and
often
give
the
writer
more
confidence
in
her
ability
if
she
needed
it.
Also,
I
found
that
the
majority
of
students
who
told
me
that
they
thought
their
ideas
weren't
focused
did
not
organize
an
outline
before
writing.
When
we
worked
on
an
outline
together,
the
students
became
more
confident
in
their
ideas
and
clarity.
This
approach
that
I
would
offer
students
often
helps
me
if
I
am
stymied
with
a
paper.
First,
I
try
to
always
develop
a
working
thesis
and
organize
an
outline
to
support
the
ideas.
I
find
that
getting
my
ideas
out
on
paper
helps
me
focus
my
thoughts
and
organize
my
paper's
structure.
I
also
was
influenced
positively
from
reading
papers
written
by
many
different
writers
who
each
have
unique
styles.
Whereas
I
had
never
begun
my
papers
by
asking
questions,
several
of
the
students
took
this
approach,
and
when
it
was
done
successfully,
I
liked
this
style
and
tried
beginning
a
few
of
my
papers
by
asking
questions.
I
also
found
myself
benefiting
from
some
of
the
questions
that
the
students
asked.
When
one
student
asked
if
a
writer
should
always
write
the
introduction
first
and
whether
the
conclusion
should
just
be
a
re-stating
of
ideas
or
if
it
should
introduce
a
grand,
novel
idea,
my
response
was
"Well,
I
guess
that's
an
individual
choice."
Before,
I
always
wrote
my
introductions
first
and
never
varied
my
conclusions.
For
some
reason,
without
much
thought,
I
always
started
my
drafts
by
writing
the
introduction.
After
this
question,
if
I
was
ever
struggling
with
a
paper
I
would
just
dive
right
into
the
body
paragraphs,
following
my
outline
rather
than
my
introduction
.
I
found
that
ignoring
the
stress
of
writing
a
solid
introduction
immediately
allowed
me
to
simply
start
writing,
start
getting
my
ideas
on
paper.
In
addition
to
experimenting
with
my
introductions,
in
most
cases
I
had
paraphrased
the
main
points
of
my
paper
in
the
conclusion.
After
being
asked
this
question,
I
started
to
vary
my
approach
to
the
conclusions,
realizing
that
I
don't
even
need
a
conclusion
in
every
paper.
From
my
students'
questions,
I
found
myself
branching
off
from
the
rules
I
had
made
for
myself.
I
became
more
likely
to
experiment
with
different
approaches
to
writing
a
draft
because
J
saw
many
people's
different
approaches
that
were
also
successful.
My
writing
experiences
of
the
past
year
that
I
described
earlier
also
helped
my
WA
work
because
my
new
found
'adventurous'
or
self-experimental
writing
allowed
me
to
appreciate
each
writer's
individual
style.
I
wanted
the
conference
and
the
students'
drafts
to
reflect
their
abilities
and
style,
not
to
be
dominated
by
my
ideas.
I
always
ask
questions
and
offer
several
suggestions
rather
than
let
the
student
ask
me
what
I
would
do
in
the
situation.
I
think
many
first-year
students,
as
I
was,
are
confused
about
the
role
of
a
WA.
Often,
some
students
think
that
a
WA
only
corrects
spelling
or
grammar,
or
they
believe
that
a
WA
is
a
perfect
writer.
When
I
met
with
the
students
before
our
first
meetings,
I
explained
to
the
students
that
I'm
in
the
same
position
as
them
as
a
student
writer.
The
advice
I
offer
is
not
the
ultimate
answer,
and
although
I
enjoy
writing
and
have
been
successful
with
my
writing,
there
is
always
room
for
improvement
and
growth
(as
I
found
out
again
this
year).
I
think
that
remembering
my
initial
reserve
and
the
misconceptions
I
had
about
my
first
WA
meeting
as
a
freshman
helped
me
put
my
students
at
ease
and
allowed
them
to
see
me
for
what
I
am,
their
peer
who
wants
to
help
them.
Looking
ahead
to
my
second
year
as
a
WA,
I
plan
on
approaching
my
conferences
in
a
similar
manner
as
I
did
last
year
because,
on
the
whole,
I
think
the
conferences
were
beneficial
to
the
students
and
to
me.
I
plan
on
asking
questions
for
feedback
on
how
the
students
felt
about
their
writing
processes.
Students
seem
to
benefit
more
when
they
do
most
of
the
talking.
I
also
hope
to
be
a
little
creative
in
some
of
my
conferences.
My
most
memorable
conference
was
with
a
student
who
was
discouraged
because
his
paper's
ideas
were
scattered.
We
ended
up
taking
scissors
and
actually
cutting
out
his
paragraphs
and
reorganizing
them
so
the
main
ideas
flowed
together.
1
enjoyed
this
conference
because
the
student
really
got
into
it
and
was
pleased
when
he
saw
that
simply
cutting
and
pasting
his
ideas
drastically
strengthened
his
draft.
When
conferences
go
this
well,
I'm
also
excited
because
I
feel
that
I
helped
someone
become
more
confident
in
his
ability.
I
try
to
stress
to
the
students
beforehand
that
the
more
advanced
draft
that
they
bring
to
a
conference,
the
more
I
am
able
to
help
them.
I
found
the
conferences
that
I
was
less
pleased
with
were
the
ones
where
students
came
in
only
with
an
outline,
or
even
less.
This
year,
I
plan
on
asking
my
professor
to
make
sure
that
the
students
produce
an
actual
draft
of
a
paper
so
that
they
are
more
involved
in
the
writing
process
and
can
benefit
from
the
conference.
Furthermore,
I
was
always
a
bit
discouraged
when
a
student
was
unresponsive
or
disinterested
in
a
conference,
but
I
maintained
a
positive
attitude
and
tried
to
get
the
student
talking
as
much
as
possible.
In
order
not
to
get
discouraged
after
meeting
with
a
student
who
didn't
put
any
effort
into
a
conference,
I
would
just
remind
myself
of
a
conference
that
had
been
beneficial.
This
year
my
conferences
might
be
different
because
I'm
working
with
upper-class
students
who
will
possibly
be
working
on
more
involved
papers.
The
students
I
will
be
meeting
with
will
be
familiar
with
the
role
of
a
WA
and
how
much
a
conference
can
benefit
a
writer.
I'm
also
working
with
the
professor
who
was
my
FYS
professor,
so
I
think
that
this
familiarity
will
make
my
WA-professor
communication
even
greater.
A
new
experience
for
me
this
year
is
that
I'm
working
with
another
WA
as
a
team
for
one
class.
It
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
new
elements
this
teamwork
will
involve.
I
think
that
working
as
a
team
could
be
a
more
positive
experience
because
we
can
turn
to
each
other
for
advice.
Overall,
I
think
that
both
my
WA
experiences
and
my
own
writing
experiences
from
this
past
year
have
broadened
my
writing.
I'm
excited
about
the
upcoming
semester
because
I'm
now
more
open-minded
about
approaches
to
my
own
writing
and
I
have
a
semester's
worth
of
W
A
experience
upon
which
to
build
new
experiences.
