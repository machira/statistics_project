Returning

Literacy
Narrative
My
first
year
as
a
Writing
Associate
challenged
my
ability
to
effectively
communicate
ideas,
as
well
as
my
preconceived
notions
about
what
an
ideal
writing
conference
should
entail.
However
as
a
result
of
my
time
spent
as
a
writing
associate,
I
also
gained
a
new
appreciation
for
writing
as
an
art,
rather
than
simply
a
chore,
as
my
views
on
the
topic
often
stood
in
stark
juxtaposition
to
those
of
my
students.
In
this
short
narrative,
I
will
relate
my
struggle
with
the
art
of
writing
over
the
past
year
as
a
result
of
my
participation
in
the
College
Writing
Program.
In
order
to
effectively
do
so,
I
will
explain
my
mindset
with
regards
to
writing
prior
to
entering
the
program,
relate
how
my
participation
and
interaction
with
other
writing
associates
and
students
challenged
my
views
on
writing,
and
finally
conclude
with
an
explanation
of
how
such
challenges
contributed
to
an
even
greater
passion
for
the
art
of
writing.
As
a
rising
junior
at
an
elite
liberal
arts
college
working
toward
degrees
in
both
History
and
English,
I
had
already
begun
to
develop
a
strong
affinity
for
writing,
as
well
as
a
strong
and
characteristic
voice
within
my
own
compositions.
As
a
student
of
both
History
and
English,
my
writing
styles
for
each
subject
became
pronounced,
and
I
had
a
good
understanding
of
the
differences
required
in
order
to
successfully
partake
in
the
academic
dialogue
ongoing
in
each
subject.
However,
as
a
student
taking
classes,
reading
literature,
and
writing
exclusively
in
the
humanities
I
found
myself
surrounded
by
likeminded
individuals
who
generally
loved
to
write,
and
recognized
the
importance
of
writing
for
both
the
relation
of
information
and
the
art
itself.
Unfortunately,
I
was
woefully
ignorant
of
the
styles
of
writing
outside
of
my
own,
and
the
prevailing
attitudes
towards
writing
that
existed
within
other
academic
disciplines.
The
past
year
I
have
spent
as
a
member
of
the
college
writing
program
has
certainly
done
much
to
expand
my
knowledge
of
said
disciplines,
and
challenged
me
to
reevaluate
my
attitude
towards
writing
in
the
face
of
opposing,
and
less
enamored,
viewpoints.
Beginning
in
the
fall
of
2010,
I
was
assigned
to
Leonard
Van
GulickOs
First
Year
Seminar
on
modern
warfare.
Perhaps
because
Professor
Van
Gulick
is
a
stalwart
in
the
Engineering
department,
many
of
the
students
assigned
to
the
class
were
also
intent
on
majoring
in
engineering
regardless
of
their
status
as
freshmen.
Therefore,
I
believe
my
challenges
as
a
writing
associate
were
two-fold.
Primarily,
I
was
charged
with
mentoring
writers
who
had
no
experience
writing
at
the
college
level,
and
were
subject
to
all
the
pitfalls
described
in
BartholomeOs
essay
NInventing
the
University.O
Secondarily,
the
writers
in
Van
GulickOs
class
were
preoccupied
with
writing
of
a
technical
nature,
that
largely
ignored
the
importance
of
fluidity
in
writing
that
allows
readers
to
more
effectively
understand
the
material
being
transmitted.
This
is
perhaps
due
to
the
vastly
different
writing
styles
present
within
the
discipline
of
engineering
that
place
a
large
premium
on
the
transmission
of
information
in
many
different
ways,
such
as
graphs
and
charts.
Therefore,
in
order
to
help
the
students
become
proficient
writers
at
the
college
level,
I
was
forced
to
engage
with
new
writers
that
not
only
had
no
exposure
to
college
writing,
but
also
were
less
than
enamored
with
the
writing
process
in
general,
as
they
shared
backgrounds
in
disciplines
in
which
writing
is
not
a
primary
focus
at
all.
Many
of
the
students
who
were
in
my
class
were
less
than
enamored
with
the
writing
process
in
general,
and
perhaps
failed
to
grasp
the
connection
between
eloquent
writing
and
effective
writing.
While
I
have
always
been
a
believer
in
the
idea
that
fluid
writing
contributes
to
a
better
understanding
on
the
behalf
of
the
reader,
it
became
apparent
that
this
was
an
unfamiliar,
or
unimportant
idea
to
my
students.
However,
they
were
clearly
aware
of
the
need
for
plenty
of
writing
within
college.
Evidently,
writing
was
more
a
chore
than
a
pleasure
for
the
freshmen,
which
stood
in
light
of
the
school
of
thought
which
holds
that
a
passion
for
writing
greatly
contributes
to
the
creation
of
easily
understandable
writing
that
is
more
beneficial
for
a
reader.
Therefore,
my
challenge
as
a
WA
was
how
to
encourage
students
who
had
little
experience
in
higher-level
writing
and
little
regard
for
writing
in
general,
to
produce
well-written
and
comprehensive
arguments
at
the
college
level.
This
sudden
divergence
from
not
only
my
own
discipline,
but
also
from
the
higher
level
of
writing
that
I
had
been
accustomed
to
forced
me
to
reconsider
my
own
relationship
with
writing.
Was
I
too
preoccupied
with
eloquence
so
that
my
meaning
was
lost
in
complex
sentence
structure?
I
had
never
thought
so.
Yet
my
students
seemed
determined
to
construct
simple
sentence
after
simple
sentence,
rarely
leaving
any
doubt
as
to
what
was
being
said,
but
instead
forcing
me
as
the
reader
to
question
more
what
was
not
being
said.
Attempts
on
my
part
to
draw
students
out
of
their
shell
and
write
a
paper
that
actually
wrestled
with
issues
and
doubted
itself
at
times
were
met
with
confusion.
Instead,
they
were
determined
to
write
simply
what
had
already
been
said
in
the
pantheon
of
academic
writing,
and
merely
summarize
and
water
down
arguments
that
had
already
been
made.
This
is
writing
of
a
sort,
but
surely
not
academic,
college-level
writing.
Yet,
from
my
conversations
with
many
engineers,
their
writing
is
only
used
to
summarize
results,
and
Nwatering
downO
the
arguments
is
desirable,
as
the
arguments
have
already
been
made
and
proven
in
the
lab
itself.
Thus,
I
realized
that
my
students
were
accustomed
to
simplification
in
writing,
which
resulted
in
papers
of
a
decidedly
non-academic
nature.
This
issue
was
compounded
in
the
spring
of
2011,
when
I
was
assigned
to
Professor
NestorOs
VAST
about
intellectual
property
and
patent
law.
Professor
Nestor
is
a
computer
engineer,
and
the
entirety
of
his
class
was
engineers.
As
these
were
all
at
least
sophomores,
although
some
juniors
were
included
in
the
class,
they
had
all
become
accustomed
to
and
entrenched
in
the
academic
writing
style
of
the
engineer,
with
a
desire
to
simply
categorize
and
summarize
facts,
with
little
to
no
analysis
or
overarching
argument.
This
is,
again,
understandable
because
of
the
nature
of
their
lab
results
making
the
argument
in
its
own
right,
but
nevertheless
this
sort
of
writing
doesnOt
necessarily
translate
well
into
academic
and
argumentative
writing.
Furthermore,
Professor
NestorOs
method
of
assigning
papers
was
extremely
formalized,
with
an
extensive
rubric
being
completed
by
him
after
each
draft.
After
completing
the
rubric,
Professor
Nestor
would
give
the
papers
to
me,
and
I
would
hold
conferences.
Whatever
passion
and
argumentative
tendencies
that
existed
in
these
papers,
as
well
as
any
desire
to
actually
meet
with
me,
were
immediately
extinguished
by
the
rubric,
as
students
felt
as
though
they
only
needed
to
fix
what
was
mentioned
on
the
rubric
in
order
to
write
the
OperfectO
paper.
This
marginalized
the
possible
benefits
of
the
college
writing
program,
and
contributed
to
what
were,
in
my
opinion,
mostly
bland
and
catered
papers,
that
held
little
individuality
or
expression
of
actual
beliefs.
Little
was
contributed
to
any
ongoing
academic
discussion,
and
little
effort
was
made
to
do
anything
beyond
simple
summarization.
Besides
this
being
frustrating
for
me
as
a
busy
college
student,
this
hampered
my
abilities
as
a
writer,
as
I
saw
another
route
being
taken
to
create
something
that
was
perceived
as
OacademicO
writing,
but
in
my
opinion
was
not.
As
a
student
of
the
humanities,
being
confronted
by
differing
writing
styles
oftentimes
contributed
to
awkward
and
somewhat
unproductive
conferences.
I
far
preferred
working
with
the
freshmen,
as
through
careful
and
probing
questions,
I
was
able
to
get
them
to
open
up
about
their
intentions
within
the
paper,
and
take
an
argumentative
stance
on
the
topic,
citing
evidence
to
support,
not
to
summarize.
Alternatively,
with
the
VAST
class,
I
felt
extremely
marginalized,
as
the
engineers
regarded
the
conferences
themselves
as
little
else
but
an
opportunity
to
see
the
rubric
created
by
the
professor
that
held
the
key
to
the
OperfectO
paper.
Therefore,
meeting
with
me,
and
discussing
the
aims,
goals,
and
positions
taken
within
the
paper
appeared
to
be
a
waste
of
time.
In
situations
like
this,
I
found
it
to
be
important
to
get
a
bit
unorthodox,
and
perhaps
leave
the
rubrics
in
my
room,
so
that
actual
conferences
could
take
place.
In
any
case,
the
past
year
certainly
enlightened
me
towards
the
different
attitudes
taken
towards
writing
by
many
people
on
the
campus,
and
forced
me
to
create
strategies
and
analogies
to
use
in
order
to
convince
those
students
who
may
be
less
inclined
towards
writing
of
its
importance.
Some
of
them
were
simple,
such
as
asking
questions
forcing
students
to
think
deeply
and
in
a
less
simplistic
manner.
Others
were
geared
more
towards
showing
students
how
to
wrestle
with
a
deep
issue
within
a
paper,
consider
all
sides
of
a
complex
issue,
and
through
oneOs
own
reasoning
supported
by
outside
sources,
come
to
a
conclusion;
essentially,
to
perform
a
lab
experiment
inside
a
paper.
But
perhaps
most
importantly
for
my
own
purposes,
I
was
forced
to
confront
ideologies
opposite
to
mine,
which
held
writing
to
be
a
not
enjoyable
or
unimportant
activity.
In
this
case,
as
in
many
cases,
the
opportunity
to
be
confronted
with
opinions
different
to
my
own
forced
me
to
reconsider
how
important
writing
is
to
me,
but
to
eventually
remain
even
more
confident
in
the
importance
of
the
writing
process,
and
in
creating
fluid
and
complex
writing
that
can
effectively
consider
all
sides
of
an
issue
and
issue
a
well-supported
but
fresh
perspective.
Therefore,
I
feel
even
more
confident
in
my
abilities
as
a
writing
associate
for
the
upcoming
year.
With
a
real
recognition
of
how
important
the
writing
process
is,
I
hope
to
be
even
more
effective
when
dealing
with
some
of
the
more
sullen
types,
who
are
slow
to
give
academic
writing
the
level
of
respect
it
deserves.
Although
I
may
never
be
able
to
hold
the
sort
of
WA
conference
that
can
inspire
a
true
love
of
writing
within
a
student,
I
hope
to
be
able
at
least
to
impart
the
knowledge
to
students
that
good
writing
is
invaluable.
Ideally,
with
the
support
of
fellow
WAOs
from
across
all
academic
disciplines,
I
can
gain
even
more
insight
into
how
to
tailor
my
conferences
to
appeal
to
people
from
all
areas
of
academia,
and
thereby
increase
the
level
of
academic
writing
at
Lafayette
College
even
further.
