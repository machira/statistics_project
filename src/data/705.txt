Returning
WA
Narrative
19
August
2011
A
full
academic
year
has
gone
by
since
beginning
my
job
as
a
Writing
Associate
with
the
College
Writing
Program.
From
that
time
I
have
learned
more
than
I
could
have
imagined
at
its
start.
As
a
first
year
WA,
I
found
myself
having
to
deal
with
unpredictable
professors,
difficult
students,
and
crazy
schedules,
all
the
while
learning
the
duties
of
the
position.
Though
it
may
seem
that
I
had
a
lot
of
trouble
with
my
job,
the
truth
is
that
all
of
those
difficulties
have
provided
me
with
insight
into
how
necessary
it
is
to
write
well,
among
other
things.
My
expectations
did
not
entirely
prepare
me
for
the
year
I
was
to
experience,
but
at
the
same
time
they
set
up
a
foundation
for
the
education
I
was
to
get.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
has
been
a
wonderful
learning
experience,
and
continues
to
be
to
this
day.
A
WA
always
hopes
that
every
conference
of
theirs
will
embody
the
Nideal
conference,O
a
notion
relatively
simple
to
imagine
yet
almost
ephemeral
in
practice.
Of
course,
the
ideal
is
entirely
subjective
to
each
WA,
but
each
variation
of
the
ideal
ends
with
the
same
goal:
the
WA
diagnosing
the
writerOs
writing
problems
and
talking
through
different
strategies
to
solve
them
with
the
writer.
The
writer
may
have
started
out
completely
lost
or
confident
in
their
work,
but
with
the
help
of
the
WA
they
learn
a
new
way
(or
hopefully
several)
to
tackle
their
writing
and
thus
create
a
better
paper.
The
WA,
too,
senses
that
the
effort
she
invested
in
both
the
paper
and
the
preparation
for
the
conference
has
been
recognized
and
appreciated
by
the
writer.
When
the
writer
leaves
Pardee
319,
he
has
a
plan
for
the
next
draft
of
his
paper
all
ready
to
execute.
My
version
of
the
ideal
conference
mirrors
the
description
above,
but
with
another
dimension
added
to
it.
I
envisioned,
upon
accepting
the
position
last
year,
that
my
students
would
be
as
eager
as
I
was
to
discuss
their
writing.
They
would
enter
Pardee
319
with
their
papers
marked
up
and
a
list
of
questions,
thoughtfully
written
down
or
organized
in
their
head,
and
jump
right
into
the
conference
before
I
could
say
hello.
Seeing
as
I
have
always
valued
writing
and
wanted
to
improve
it
in
whatever
way
possible,
I
looked
forward
to
my
conferences
and
tried
to
make
the
most
of
them.
I
assumed
the
students
I
would
work
with
would
act
the
same
as
I
did.
What
a
trivial
and
narcissistic
notion.
As
I
began
my
conferences
in
the
fall,
I
noticed
that
a
lot
of
my
students
fell
silent
when
the
time
to
talk
about
their
paper
began.
They
looked
to
me
as
the
expert
on
their
own
writing,
when
in
reality
I
played
the
role
as
a
background
researcher
who
points
out
the
potential
flaws
in
the
paperOs
development.
There
were
writers
of
mine
who
did
come
prepared
to
talk
about
their
writing,
yet
whether
out
of
ignorance
or
apathy
about
the
conference
process,
a
lot
of
my
students
desired
short
conversations
and
quick
solutions
to
their
writing
problems.
I
think
that
is
the
dichotomous
nature
of
a
WA
conference
though:
one
slot
I
would
have
a
student
eager
to
discuss
their
work,
while
the
slot
right
after
would
see
me
trying
to
get
a
student
to
talk.
A
conference
can
be
either
comforting
and
rewarding
for
one
writer
and
completely
awkward
and
difficult
for
another.
I
believe
the
outcome
of
a
conference
depends
on
two
factors.
One
is
how
the
students
approach
the
conference.
Some
see
the
time
spent
talking
about
their
writing
to
be
completely
beneficial
and
will
more
often
than
not
willingly
discuss
their
work
and
consider
the
advice
I
have
to
give.
This
type
of
student
creates
that
ideal
conference,
as
they
want
to
explore
the
different
avenues
they
can
take
in
order
to
produce
the
best
possible
version
of
their
paper.
Some
students,
on
the
other
hand,
see
the
conference
as
a
requirement
for
the
class
and
not
much
else.
They
expect
to
get
a
list
of
whatever
errors
they
may
have
in
their
paper
in
as
little
time
as
possible.
During
my
first
year,
the
students
I
dealt
with
fell
on
a
spectrum
between
the
two
types
I
have
described,
with
more
of
them
recognizing
the
value
of
the
conferences
than
shrugging
it
off.
Despite
the
studentOs
opinion
towards
the
conference,
the
other
factor
influencing
the
conferenceOs
outcome
is
the
ability
of
the
WA
to
effectively
conduct
the
conference.
Throughout
the
weekly
staff
meetings,
WAs
learned
several
approaches
to
engage
the
writer,
whatever
their
disposition
during
a
conference,
and
help
them
create
their
own
solutions
to
their
writing
problems.
I
have
found
the
facilitative
approach
to
be
the
best
method
for
helping
a
confused
writer
work
through
their
difficulties.
In
fact,
my
most
rewarding
experience
as
a
WA
occurred
during
the
fall
semester
with
the
help
of
this
heuristic.
In
the
second
conference
I
talked
to
my
FYS
students
about
their
paper
which
required
them
to
pick
a
work
of
art
and
analyze
it.
A
pretty
basic
format,
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
goliath
for
one
student.
He
came
into
the
Watt
writing
room
with
a
painting
and
needing
a
thesis
statement.
Spurred
by
the
facilitative
method,
an
idea
entered
my
mind
and
I
ran
with
it.
I
asked
him
why
he
chose
the
painting.
He
answered
plainly
that
it
intrigued
him.
I
asked
him
why
that
was.
He
described
the
dark,
moody
colors.
I
asked
why
the
colors
jumped
out
at
him
the
most.
He
answered
with
his
opinion
that
the
colors
contrasted
the
optimistic
portrayal
of
the
city.
Right
there
I
stopped
with
the
incessant
questioning
and
casually
remarked
that
his
answer
seemed
like
a
solid
working
thesis
to
me.
He
smiled,
I
smiled,
and
the
experiment
worked.
That
is
the
success
of
the
facilitative
approach.
It
allows
for
the
WA
to
lead
the
student
into
discovering
the
balm
for
their
writing
woes
all
by
themselves.
Yet
they
still
maintain
control
over
their
writing,
which
is
essential
to
the
entire
learning
process.
Despite
its
strengths
as
a
teaching
method,
the
facilitative
approach
has
its
limitations.
I
have
found
that
it
is
not
always
applicable
to
all
of
my
students.
More
than
once
have
I
tried
utilizing
the
facilitative
approach
and
seen
it
fall
flat
on
the
ground.
This
goes
back
to
how
a
student
approaches
the
conference.
During
my
second
semester
as
a
WA,
I
was
assigned
the
Introduction
to
Comparative
Politics
class.
The
class
required
students
to
write
one
or
two
page
papers
on
different
political
topics.
Most
of
the
students
I
encountered
realized
the
facile
nature
of
the
page
length,
but
still
had
questions
about
their
writing
and
managed
to
get
full,
worthwhile
conferences.
One
student,
however,
was
particularly
difficult
during
our
meetings,
as
he
gave
off
the
impression
that
the
conferences
were
unnecessary
and
that
these
papers
should
not
have
been
held
up
to
the
same
standards
as
a
ten-page
assignment.
Our
conferences
were
trying:
he
replied
to
my
leading
questions
with
curtness
and
insisted
that
his
writing
was
fine.
When
I
tried
the
directive
approach
and
explained
to
him
the
errors
in
his
writing,
he
contradicted
me
in
almost
all
instances
instead
of
working
together
to
understand
what
I
was
trying
to
say.
I
had
exhausted
all
the
teaching
I
learned
in
the
staff
meetings
to
help
this
student,
but
by
the
end
of
each
conference
I
felt
as
though
I
hardly
reached
him
at
all.
In
this
matter
it
was
not
so
much
that
my
method
had
failed,
but
rather
the
student
was
quite
unwilling
to
reevaluate
his
writing
and
felt
that
the
conferences
were
a
waste
of
time.
It
had
to
be
the
most
frustrating
moment
in
my
time
as
a
WA.
In
tough
situations
as
these,
I
realized
that
patience
and
utilization
of
the
techniques
learned
are
necessary
to
master.
One
final
lesson
I
learned
while
working
as
a
WA
was
the
effective
communication
with
my
partner
professors
to
determine
what
they
look
for
in
their
studentsO
assignments.
The
first
meeting
with
my
professor,
I
will
admit,
was
daunting
because
I
worried
I
would
miss
asking
an
important
question
and
thus
be
unprepared
to
help
the
students.
However,
over
the
course
of
the
year,
I
became
more
and
more
comfortable
with
talking
to
the
professors
about
their
assignments.
I
even
had
the
benefit
of
working
with
a
more
experienced
WA
during
the
second
semester
when
we
shared
a
class
of
thirty
students,
in
addition
to
the
helpful
staff
meetings
when
we
addressed
these
issues.
During
my
first
semester,
though,
I
had
to
face
the
challenge
of
an
unpredictable
partner
professor
who
did
not
always
inform
me
of
my
schedule.
The
professor
hated
Moodle,
so
we
came
up
with
a
plan
in
which
I
would
email
him
my
sign
up
sheet
of
available
conference
times
and
he
would
distribute
it
to
the
class
and
return
it
to
me
after
the
students
had
signed
up.
For
the
first
two
conferences
it
worked
well,
but
right
after
those
conferences
it
became
very
difficult
to
communicate
with
him
via
his
preferred
method
of
contact,
email.
I
lent
it
mostly
to
the
busy
part
of
the
semester
when
everyone
sees
an
increase
in
work,
but
at
the
same
time
I
felt
that
my
professor
was
ignoring
me.
I
had
to
start
visiting
his
office
in
person
in
order
to
organize
schedules
and
conferences,
which
turned
out
to
be
better
communication-wise.
I
have
learned
to
be
flexible
when
it
comes
to
contacting
the
professor,
but
it
did
take
a
couple
of
frustrating
moments
to
get
that
lesson.
In
my
new
WA
literacy
narrative,
I
finished
my
conclusion
stating
that
I
had
entered
a
new
phase
in
my
writing
in
which
I
hoped
to
learn
how
to
sophistically
unify
my
desire
for
artistic
expression
with
the
scholarly
demands
of
college
writing.
I
had
my
future
position
as
a
WA
to
look
forward
to,
partly
as
an
opportunity
to
improve
the
writing
of
my
fellow
college
students,
but
also
as
a
vehicle
to
better
my
own
writing
skills.
Though
I
still
feel
as
though
my
personal
endeavor
in
improvement
is
still
a
work
in
progress,
I
can
comfortably
say
that
my
first
year
as
a
WA
has
had
a
decent
influence
on
my
writing.
Not
only
have
I
been
able
to
recognize
potential
pitfalls
during
the
writing
process
through
the
analysis
of
my
studentsO
papers,
I
have
also
learned
techniques
that
enable
me
to
avoid
those
tricky
issues
through
the
discussions
I
have
had
with
my
students.
I
feel
as
though
this
position
has
opened
up
my
mind
to
different
ways
of
thought
and
process
that
I
never
had
tried
experimenting
with.
I
have
even
used
the
Nasking
whyO
method
for
a
few
of
my
own
papers
when
I
was
struggling
to
produce
a
thesis
after
seeing
the
success
it
had
with
my
FYS
student.
Granted,
the
transformation
of
my
writing
has
not
been
so
substantial
as
to
warrant
full
credit
to
the
CWP,
but
it
has
been
significant
enough
for
me
to
notice
some
positive
change.
I
have
realized
over
this
past
year
as
a
WA
that
having
an
ideal
conference
is
not
possible
every
single
time
one
of
my
students
enters
Pardee
319,
but
I
certainly
come
close.
Not
all
of
my
students
come
in
prepared
with
questions,
but
they
do
respond
well
to
the
facilitative
method.
Irritating
experiences
such
as
the
one
I
described
above
occur
infrequently
enough
to
have
made
my
first
year
as
a
WA
enjoyable
and
fulfilling.
Upon
reflection,
the
majority
of
my
conferences
went
well
and
without
any
major
problems.
The
best
aspect
of
this
is
job
has
been
helping
improve
my
studentsO
writing,
especially
by
leading
them
to
self-discovery.
It
means
that
I
get
to
help
students
learn
about
and
deal
with
the
difficulties
of
writing.
The
best
result
is
the
overall
improvement
of
writing
at
Lafayette
College.
