Return
of
the
WA
Essay
When
I
became
a
Writing
Associate
(WA)
I
was
very
nervous.
I
felt
confident
in
my
ability
to
write
and
edit
my
own
work,
but
I
was
unsure
if
I
would
be
good
at
editing
the
works
of
others.
The
area
I
was
particularly
concerned
about
was
being
able
to
explain
finer
points
of
grammar.
I
always
believed
myself
to
be
a
good
writer.
I
enjoy
the
construction
and
manipulation
of
language,
so
writing
was
never
a
chore
for
me
as
it
seems
to
be
for
others.
I
think
my
problem
was
I
would
become
so
engrossed
with
what
I
was
writing
that
I
sometimes
lost
sight
of
how
to
write
it.
Instead
of
successfully
creating
a
sentence
containing
two
dependent
clauses,
I
would
either
write
two
different
sentences
or
I
would
comma
splice
one
large
sentence
to
death.
I
knew
I
would
have
to
explain
these
different
point
of
grammar
to
my
students,
so
I
began
taking
more
time
to
read
St.
Martin's
handbooks
and
other
handbooks,
and
I
actually
made
an
effort
to
remember
what
I
looked
up.
I
began
keeping
a
file
on
my
disk
that
gave
a
quick
summary
of
when
to
use
a
comma,
how
to
footnote
correctly,
etc.
By
learning
to
define
and
explain
concepts
such
as
the
difference
between
dependent
and
independent
clauses,
I
feel
not
only
did
the
writing
of
my
students
improve,
but
mine
did
as
well.
Grasping
the
concepts
of
finer
points
of
grammar
and
sentence
construction
helped
me
to
write
with
a
more
intellectual
and
sophisticated
style.
My
grammatical
style
also
improved
because
I
began
taking
psychology
courses
with
laboratories.
The
American
Psychological
Association
(APA)
has
a
very
strict,
specific
manner
as
to
how
every
psychology
paper
is
written,
and
all
of
my
psychology
professors
strictly
adhered
to
these
guidelines.
I
had
to
be
a
lot
more
careful
of
my
writing
because
a
misplaced
punctuation
mark
could
cost
me
points
on
a
laboratory
report.
Another
way
my
writing
has
improved
is
by
my
taking
more
time
to
edit
a
piece
before
printing
the
finished
copy.
This
strategy
came
from
my
experience
as
a
WA.
I
would
read
my
students'
papers
and
say
to
myself,
Did
any
of
them
read
this
over
before
passing
it
in
to
me?
.
Conferences
would
have
gone
much
smoother
if
several
of
the
students
had
bothered
to
proof-read
their
assignments
or
if
they
had
done
some
minor
editing
before
meeting
with
me.
Even
spell
check
would
have
been
nice.
Remembering
the
old
saying,
People
who
live
in
glass
houses
shouldn't
throw
stones,
I
turned
a
critical
eye
to
my
own
work
and
decided
it
could
use
some
editing
as
well.
A
life-long
procrastinator,
the
editing
process
was
usually
done
in
a
frantic
rush.
Although
I
always
did
my
research
for
papers
well
in
advance,
and
I
would
mentally
organize
and
structure
papers
while
doing
mundane
tasks,
the
actual
writing
process
of
the
paper
was
often
done
in
a
hurried
rush.
Just
getting
the
paper
done
and
passed
in
on
time
was
my
priority,
and
the
process
of
physically
--
not
mentally--
editing
a
paper
usually
suffered.
I
write
as
I
think
and
while
my
fingers
are
busy
trying
to
keep
up
with
my
thoughts,
I
sometimes
lose
sight
of
editing.
I
used
to
write
papers
and
essays
in
a
big
rush,
hurrying
to
get
every
word
down
before
I
forgot
it
forever.
Only
after
the
entire
assignment
was
written
would
return
to
it
for
editing.
Since
becoming
a
WA
I
believe
my
writing
has
improved
because
I
do
more
of
my
editing
as
I
write
my
assignment.
After
each
paragraph
is
written
I
read
it
over
once
or
twice
and
usually
make
minor
adjustments
to
it.
Sometimes
the
adjustments
are
not
quite
so
minor,
and
I
wind
up
re-writing
the
paragraph,
and
sometimes
even
the
one
before
it.
I
find
the
edit-while-you-work
method
has
helped
improve
the
style
and
clarity
of
my
writing.
The
experience
I
gained
as
a
WA
carried
over
into
one
of
my
summer
jobs
writing
for
a
newspaper.
Because
everything
I
wrote
would
be
read
by
5,000
people,
it
had
to
be
perfect.
Although
it
took
me
a
week
or
two
to
adjust
to
the
Associated
Press
style,
which
is
much
different
than
academic
writing,
the
transition
was
smoother
thanks
to
the
lessons
learned
as
a
WA.
Working
as
a
WA
is
great
because
not
only
is
it
a
job,
it
is
a
learning
experience
as
well.
