August

1997
My
earliest
memories
of
writing
are
from
second
grade.
Daily,
Mr.
Conway
would
present
a
large
easel
for
the
students
to
read
at
the
beginning
of
class.
To
improve
our
penmanship,
we
copied
the
few
sentences,
which
were
the
beginning
of
a
story.
Out
loud,
we
would
all
contribute
to
creating
a
story.
Then
we
would
each
draw
a
picture
to
represent
the
story.
As
the
school
year
passed,
the
easel
would
still
have
about
three
sentences
written
on
it,
but
then
it
was
turn
for
each
student
to
write
an
ending
to
the
story
and
share
it
with
the
class.
On
large
manila
paper,
the
kind
with
the
dark
blue
lines
that
dotted
the
middle
spaces,
I
wrote
of
monsters,
trips
to
amusement
parks,
my
cats,
and
my
parents.
My
masterpieces
were
just
about
a
paragraph
in
length,
but
they
were
written
with
such
excitement
Each
story
had
a
happy
ending
punctualized
with
an
exclamation
point.
As
I
wrote
by
myself
more,
I
felt
more
confident
and
independent.
By
third
grade
I
was
working
on
Haiku
poems
about
ice
cream
and
black
cats.
My
teacher,
Ms.
Winters,
also
made
us
write
in
a
journal
after
recess.
My
favorite
topic
to
write
about
was
the
game
I
had
just
played
about
a
time
machine
that
took
me
and
my
friend
Kelly
to
the
future
and
to
other
planets.
These
stories
were
my
beginnings
in
creative
writing.
I
described
the
wooded
territory
lining
the
soccer
field
as
the
green
planet
and
the
rocks
were
meteors
that
had
landed
from
outer-
space.
The
twigs
were
our
laser
swords
to
fight
aliens
hiding
behind
the
green
planet's
trees.
Every
day
I
would
write
about
the
ventures
from
which
we
had
just
returned,
narrowly
escaping
the
aliens
in
time
to
get
back
to
class.
Ms.
Winters
often
found
my
adventures
amusing
and
she
complimented
my
imagination.
Fourth
grade
was
a
milestone
for
writing
because
we
were
allowed
to
use
ink
if
we
had
perfected
our
cursive.
This
privilege
instilled
me
with
a
sense
of
pride
because
I
was
the
first
person
in
my
class
to
switch
from
dull
gray
graphite
to
bright
blue
or
black
ink.
We
were
all
so
excited
that
even
math
^vas
done
in
ink
with
erasable
pen.
However,
writing
became
more
of
a
challenge
because
we
had
to
write
two-page
reports.
I
was
only
used
to
writing
one-page
book
reports
on
books
such
as
Nancy
Drew
and
other
mysteries.
That
year,
each
student
was
given
a
state
and
I
was
assigned
to
write
about
Iowa.
Although
that
was
my
first
experience
with
a
research
paper,
it
was
not
difficult
because
it
consisted
mainly
of
restating
facts.
I
retrieved
most
of
my
information
from
encyclopedias
and
the
World
Almanac.
More
creativity
was
needed
for
the
second
report,
and
I
wrote
about
how
to
effectively
shop
for
groceries.
I
gave
tips
suggesting
consumers
should
clip
coupons
and
not
write
checks
because
they
hold
up
the
checkout
lines.
My
teacher
liked
the
advice
in
my
report
and,
along
with
some
other
students'
work,
it
was
selected
to
appear
in
the
school's
monthly
newspaper.
I
was
proud
because
I
had
never
had
any
writing
published
before.
The
next
research
paper
I
wrote
was
in
sixth
grade.
Assigned
to
write
five
pages
about
a
historical
figure
from
the
Civil
War
era,
I
chose
to
write
about
the
court
case
of
the
former
slave
Dred
Scott.
Researching
our
topics
became
more
involved
by
taking
class
trips
to
the
library,
searching
the
card
catalogue
for
books,
and
looking
for
articles
in
magazines
and
encyclopedias.
After
we
handed
in
our
reports,
I
remember
that
my
teacher
said
she
hoped
that
she
had
prepared
us
well
for
schoolwork
at
the
junior
high.
In
junior
high
English
we
began
writing
essays
responding
to
themes
of
books
we
had
been
assigned
such
as
Great
Expectations
and
Of
Mice
and
Men.
These
were
the
first
papers
to
focus
on
intellectual,
grammatically
correct
writing
that
also
required
personal
ideas.
My
first
true
experience
in
writing
a
thesis
paper
was
for
history
class
in
ninth
grade.
We
worked
on
the
paper
for
two
months,
carefully
honing
research
skills
on
the
computerized
catalogue,
constantly
improving
the
thesis
to
make
it
specific
and
well-supported,
and
learning
how
to
paraphrase
and
cite
quotations
without
plagiarizing.
The
teacher
even
collected
our
note
cards
to
ensure
we
researched
properly.
Another
difference
that
had
evolved
over
this
year
was
that
we
now
could
only
hand
in
computer-typed
assignments.
My
paper
on
Adolf
Hitler
was
twelve
pages
long
and
had
two
pages
of
endnotes.
After
ninth
grade
we
had
to
write
a
term
paper
every
year
until
senior
year.
My
senior
year
Expository
Writing
class
had
the
most
influence
on
improving
my
writing
ability.
Unlike
English
classes
in
tenth
and
eleventh
grade,
which
included
journal,
essay,
and
analytical
writing
in
response
to
literature,
this
class
focused
solely
on
writing
techniques
and
writing
in
different
genres.
First,
we
extensively
reviewed
the
basic
rules
of
structure
and
grammar,
such
as
mastering
common
mistakes
like
the
difference
between
its
and
it's.
We
also
worked
on
skills
such
as
making
sure
our
paragraphs
flowed
together
and
perfecting
sentence
variety.
Next,
we
wrote
a
variety
of
essays,
such
as
an
opinion
and
persuasion
paper,
a
compare/contrast
paper,
a
research
paper,
and
a
narrative
of
a
funny
experience.
Another
helpful
aspect
of
the
course
was
that
before
each
paper
was
handed
in
to
our
teacher,
we
would
have
peer
review
sessions
where
other
students
would
read
our
drafts
and
write
feedback
to
improve
the
draft.
The
peer
review
was
beneficial
because
it
forced
us
to
write
a
solid
first
draft
for
our
peer-
writers,
to
receive
helpful
comments
from
them,
and
then
to
revise
the
paper
thoroughly
for
the
final
draft.
In
addition,
the
day
a
paper
was
due,
our
teacher
would
anonymously
read
our
final
drafts
to
the
class.
The
reading
enabled
the
class
to
hear
how
we
each
responded
to
the
assignment,
and
we
were
then
encouraged
to
point
out
any
strengths
or
weaknesses
in
the
papers.
The
intensive,
open
nature
of
this
class
greatly
influenced
my
writing.
First,
my
grammar
and
structure
skills
were
strengthened,
which
helped
me
clearly
convey
my
thoughts
into
words.
Next,
I
experienced
writing
essays
of
multiple
genres^
Finally,
peer
review
and
reading
our
papers
out
loud
helped
because,
similar
to
the
Writing
Associate
program,
it
gave
a
writer
feedback
from
an
informed
student
on
how
to
improve
a
draft.
This
class,
above
all,
made
me
feel
prepared
for
college-level
writing.
For
freshman-year
English
I
expected
a
rigid,
repetitious
class
that
explained
and
reviewed
steps
for
improving
writing
skills.
Instead,
I
was
happily
surprised
when
I
found
out
that
at
Lafayette
each
freshman
chooses
a
different
section
of
a
First
Year
Seminar.
Even
better,
I
thought,
that
we
could
select
a
seminar
from
an
entire
range
of
topics.
For
example,
I
selected
an
architecture-based
art
history
class,
while
a
friend
took
the
seminar
on
biodiversity
and
factors
contributing
to
species
extinction.
The
first
year
seminar
was
an
excellent
program
because
it
allowed
me
to
improve
my
English
skills
while
learning
about
the
history
of
art.
Normally,
I
probably
would
not
have
taken
a
class
about
architecture,
so
it
introduced
me
to
a
different
subject
and
helped
my
writing
ability.
Other
beneficial
experiences
in
my
first
year
seminar
were
that
after
writing
drafts
of
each
of
the
three
papers,
we
would
hold
peer
review
sessions
and
meet
with
our
Writing
Associate.
Similar
to
my
high
school
review,
the
peer
sessions
helped
me
receive
informed
suggestions
on
how
to
improve
my
papers.
Also,
the
sessions
allowed
me
to
compare
my
work
with
my
classmates'
papers.
At
times,
however,
I
was
surprised
when
I
read
a
classmate's
work.
For
example,
simple
grammatical
rules
and
even
spelling
mistakes
were
common.
Through
writing
my
papers
and
reading
my
classmates'
papers,
I
found
the
most
common
weakness
was
organizing
ideas
into
a
clear,
supported
thesis
paper.
I
then
became
interested
in
the
other
advantageous
aspect
of
the
class,
the
Writing
Associate
program.
After
peer
review,
we
met
with
our
assigned
Associate
and
she
further
helped
us
improve
our
drafts
by
suggesting
ways
to
strengthen
our
papers.
The
informal
meetings
also
helped
me
feel
comfortable
enough
to
ask
questions
I
had
about
my
paper.
By
the
time
the
papers
were
handed
in
to
my
professor,
about
three
other
informed
readers
had
all
helped
me
improve
my
draft.
In
second-semester
English
110
class,
I
had
my
best
writing
experience.
First,
I
found
my
professor
very
intellectually
inspiring,
but
I
knew
he
had
a
reputation
for
tearing
apart
people's
work.
For
our
second
paper
I
wrote
about
imagery
in
the
memoir
we
had
just
read.
After
reading
our
first
draft,
the
professor
would
read
aloud
strengths,
but
mostly
weaknesses,
of
some
of
the
papers.
I
knew
I
had
written
a
solid
paper,
but
I
was
really
proud
when
my
professor
read
my
entire
six-page
essay
to
the
class.
Then
my
classmates
responded
with
comments
like
"Wow.
That
was
really
good."
A
classmate
at
a
party
a
week
later
even
complimented
me
on
my
paper.
I
was
really
proud
that
my
professor
and
my
class
respected
my
effort
and
my
writing.
In
comparison
to
my
best
writing
experience,
I've
never
had
an
all-time
worst
experience.
However,
I've
had
writer's
block
many
times.
For
example,
second
semester
I
had
only
a
one-page
paper
due
but
nothing
was
helping
to
develop
ideas.
My
friend
forced
me
to
play
frisbee
on
the
quad
with
her
to
get
my
mind
off
the
assignment.
When
I
sat
down
an
hour
later,
ideas
came
to
me
and
I
wrote
the
paper.
Learning
from
experience,
whenever
I
have
writer's
block
it
helps
to
re-read
the
assignment
to
fully
understand
it,
talk
with
classmates
to
get
ideas,
ask
my
professor
questions
and
explain
what
I'm
finding
troublesome,
or
just
wait
until
something
comes
to
me.
Although
I'm
now
in
college,
my
history
of
a
writer
is
far
from
complete.
Since
its
beginnings,
most
every
experience
I've
encountered
has
helped
my
growth
as
a
writer.
For
example,
technology
alone
has
greatly
advanced,
and
instead
of
researching
from
a
card
catalogue
as
I
did
in
fourth
grade,
I
can
now
obtain
information
from
the
computer
and
the
internet.
Personally,
my
writing
has
evolved
to
include
all
types
of
literary
genres.
Beginning
with
writing
stories,
journals,
and
poetry,
I
can
now
write
papers
such
as
thesis,
opinion,
and
response.
My
senior
year
English
class
helped
me
gain
the
most
experience
in
becoming
an
able
writer.
The
helpful,
review-oriented
nature
of
my
first
year
seminar
further
helped
strengthen
my
writing
ability.
Even
though
my
writing
has
greatly
advanced
since
my
first
attempts
as
a
writer,
my
literary
history
will
continue
because
writing
is
a
perpetual
process
of
writing,
revising,
and
improving.
