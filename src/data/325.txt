Writing
Like
an
Engineer
Generally
when
writing
a
paper
I
try
to
let
the
muse
find
me,
but
often
time
constraints
interfere.
Such
is
the
case
here,
as
I
finally
complete
this
paper
with
but
a
few
days
till
the
deadline.
This
is
too
often
the
case,
and
thus
the
subject
for
my
paper:
why
I
am
a
WA's
nightmare
writer.
I'm
not
sure
what
I
wrote
in
my
last
assignment,
since
I
wrote
it
over
a
day
on
vacation.
Thus,
should
I
repeat
myself
I
beg
forgiveness.
In
staff
conferences
last
fall
we
discussed
various
ways
to
improve
our
skills
as
both
writers
and
WAs.
During
those
meetings
I
discovered
that
many
of
my
fellow
WAs
had
many
experiences
in
common
with
each
other,
but
not
many
with
me.
Several
described
the
"five
paragraph"
format,
which
I
had
never
even
heard
of,
or
related
tales
concerning
the
use
of
outlines
or
note
cards.
Nearly
all
wrote
at
least
two
drafts
for
a
paper.
I,
on
the
other
hand,
use
none
of
these
techniques.
I
used
note
cards
and
outlines
grudgingly
when
forced,
often
forging
them
after
I
had
written
the
paper
or
churning
out
dummy
cards
that
looked
reasonable
but
had
little
to
do
with
my
paper.
In
this
I
recognize
that
I
was
wasting
my
effort,
that
it
would
have
been
far
easier
to
subscribe
to
the
form
rather
than
spend
time
working
around
it.
These
techniques
have
never
worked
for
me.
Though
I
often
write
snippets
of
my
papers
in
my
head
while
I
lie
in
bed
waiting
for
sleep
or
while
I
have
an
idle
moment
in
the
day,
these
form
only
the
core
idea
of
the
paper,
and
that
often
only
in
the
initial
paragraphs.
I
find
that
my
papers
are
best
written
by
sitting
down
and
letting
the
words
flow
from
my
hands.
There
is
a
scene
in
the
movie
"Finding
Forrester"
where
Sean
Connery
sits
at
his
typewriter
and
produces
a
page
of
text
while
talking
cheerfully
to
his
pupil.
He
shows
no
effort
toward
the
writing,
and
the
gist
of
his
speech
is
that
a
first
draft
should
be
written
with
the
heart,
and
revision
should
be
done
later
with
the
head.
I
find
this
idea
rather
romantic
and
compelling,
and
it
offers
some
vague
credibility
to
my
rather
slapdash
attempts
at
composition.
Still,
there
remains
a
good
deal
of
difference
between
''writing"
as
a
writer
does
and
writing
a
paper
for
a
class.
One
of
the
most
influential
books
I
read
in
the
last
year
was
Galatea
2.2.
The
book
discussed
among
other
things
the
idea
that
a
computer,
if
properly
instructed,
could
produce
independently
a
paper
indistinguishable
from
that
of
a
graduate
student,
simply
by
manipulation
of
recognized
symbols
and
patterns.
This
idea
also
appeals
to
me,
for
I
have
lately
taken
a
very
cynical
attitude
toward
my
writing.
Though
I
have
only
taken
two
English
classes
over
the
past
year,
I
still
found
myself
repeating
my
ideas
quite
often.
Without
delving
too
deeply
into
the
details,
I
did
well
in
both
classes.
Apparently
my
writing
pleased
both
of
my
teachers;
why
then
did
it
not
please
me?
I
have
never
been
accused
of
being
a
perfectionist.
My
writing
is
haphazard,
ill
thought
out,
self-indulgent,
and
overly
filled
with
hyphenation
and
other
questionable
word
choices
brought
on
by
hubris,
laziness,
or
a
decreasing
grasp
of
the
language.
Indeed,
at
this
point
in
the
paper
I
find
myself
growing
bored
with
what
I
have
to
say,
for
it
seems
repetitive
and
dull.
When
I
find
this
happening
I
turn
to
the
thoughts
of
other
writers;
not
to
plagiarize,
to
be
sure,
but
rather
simply
stylistically.
If
I
compare
the
timeline
of
my
writing
to
the
books
I
was
reading
at
the
time,
I
find
striking
parallels.
While
I
suspect
that
all
writers
are
influenced
at
one
time
or
another
by
their
fellows,
in
my
case
I
feel
I
borrow
from
others
because
I
lack
my
own
style.
This
returns
me
to
the
concept
of
the
writing
computer
from
Galatea.
In
writing
a
paper
I
choose
one
of
three
paths.
The
first
of
these
is
the
modification
or
outright
perversion
of
the
assignment
to
suit
my
own
ends.
When
I
find
something
about
the
paper
that
I
can
twist
in
order
to
enjoy
the
effort
more,
I
leap
at
the
chance.
The
second
path
is
to
regurgitate
an
idea
that
I
have
espoused
in
class,
with
additional
examples.
While
this
may
be
a
semi-legitimate
technique,
I
find
it
both
boring
and
lame,
to
use
the
vernacular.
The
final
option
is
to
simply
start
writing
and
see
where
I
end
up.
While
it
is
true
that
the
previous
two
options
use
this
technique
at
some
point,
in
the
extreme
case
I
start
to
write
the
paper
with
nothing
more
than
the
barest
hint
of
where
I
am
headed.
Often
these
papers
please
me
the
most,
for
the
writing
is
a
voyage
of
discovery,
and
my
thought
process
is
apparent
upon
reading.
In
most
cases
but
particularly
here
the
paper
begins
somewhat
slowly
and
builds
to
a
rather
overblown
finish
(and
here
I
get
the
distinct
suspicion
that
I
am
repeating
myself)
that
is
somewhat
exhilarating.
In
these
cases
the
most
revising
I
do
is
to
play
with
the
introductory
paragraph
a
bit
to
align
it
with
the
conclusion,
as
if
I
had
intended
it
all
along.
Since
that
paragraph
was
becoming
a
touch
long,
I
shall
shift
gears
for
a
moment
and
return
to
my
fear
that
I
steal
from
other
writers.
I
feel
that
the
most
significant
paper
I
wrote
in
the
last
year
was
the
continuing
work
in
my
spring
semester
English
class.
There
I
hit
upon
two
major
points
that
I
feel
shaped
my
writing.
The
first
of
these
is
a
quote
by
Harlan
Ellison,
easily
one
of
my
favorite
writers.
In
his
treatise
to
aspiring
writers
he
states,"
The
only
thing
worth
writing
about
is
people.
Let
me
say
that
again.
The
only
thing
worth
writing
about
is
people.
People."
While
this
may
seem
an
obvious
comment
to
the
old
hands
in
the
audience,
it
is
a
surprising
revelation
to
a
fool
like
me.
When
I
thought
back
on
the
books
I've
enjoyed
and
considered
worthy
of
my
time,
the
common
thread
was
satisfying
character
development,
or
at
the
very
least
compelling
sketches.
After
reading
that
passage
I
found
myself
focusing
much
more
on
that
aspect
of
the
works
I
read,
whereas
before
I
might
have
considered
symbolism
a
deeper
mine
for
the
paper
mill,
to
butcher
cliches.
The
second
of
the
two
points
was,
of
course,
that
of
the
writing
computer.
However,
I'm
still
out
of
breath
from
writing
about
that,
so
on
to
something
else
again.
I
feel
that
my
writing
is
too
stilted.
Even
composing
the
final
two
words
of
that
sentence,
"too
stilted"
required
half
a
minute's
thought
on
the
proper
word
choice.
I
wish
I
could
allow
myself,
as
I
have
to
some
degree
in
this
paper,
to
relax
in
my
writing
and
perhaps
then
allow
my
own
voice
to
come
through.
The
only
reason
I
can
do
that
here,
unfortunately,
is
that
I
know
that
this
paper
will
not
result
in
a
grade.
This
is
not
to
say
(he
hurriedly
adds)
that
I
don't
consider
this
paper
important,
but
rather
that
I
view
it
as
an
opportunity
to,
among
other
things,
use
contractions
for
once
in
my
life.
On
now
to
how
being
a
WA
affects
my
writing.
Thus
far,
it
has
not
to
any
degree.
I
suspect
this
has
largely
to
do
with
the
fact
that
I
have
been
WA
for
ES225
the
last
two
semesters.
This
fall,
with
an
FYS
as
my
assignment
I
hope
to
grow
as
a
writer
and
also
as
a
WA,
though
it
will
be
my
final
semester.
It
seems
that
two
things
have
defined
my
WA
experience.
The
first
is
that
as
the
engineering
VAST
WA,
I
was
somewhat
different
than
my
colleagues.
The
second
is
that
I
did
not
become
a
WA
until
my
senior
year,
and
so
was
once
again
a
rather
different
animal
than
the
other
WAs.
Given
that
I
did
not
know
many
of
the
other
WAs
and
my
natural
good
nature
kept
me
from
befriending
them,
I
view
the
entire
program
through
the
eyes
of
an
outsider.
It
is
often
difficult
for
me
to
sort
through
the
rhetoric,
of
sorts
that
the
program
promulgates
about
itself
and
the
sometimes
facetious,
sometimes
not,
comments
of
my
fellows
concerning
their
experiences.
As
a
result,
I
have
no
idea
what
being
a
WA
is
really
like
and
am
rather
at
a
loss
as
to
how
to
proceed
this
fall.
Fortunately,
I
am
dealing
with
incoming
frosh
and
by
the
time
my
comment
cards
come
in
my
diploma
will
be
in
the
mail.
Hopefully.
Though
I
am
coming
in
somewhat
under
code
here
at
around
5
pages,
I
find
myself
desiring
to
pack
it
in.
I
have
no
doubt
that
this
paper
will
never
serve
to
help
a
new
WA
learn
more
about
the
program,
nor
will
it
be
presented
a
classic
example
of
introspective
writing
at
the
training
conference.
Nonetheless
it
has
been
liberating
to
finally
ease
my
standards
and
speak
honestly
about
my
writing
process.
I
think
in
the
future
I
should
work
on
having
an
outline
first.
