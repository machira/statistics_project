Recent
Writing
History
Project
for
Workshop
August
5,
2000
I
have
this
strange
idea
that
writing
becomes
easier
as
the
years
progress,
but
as
of
yet,
I
have
not
experienced
such
ease
of
writing.
I've
found
that
introductions
are
probably
the
most
difficult
section
of
a
paper,
and
I
even
struggled
with
this
introduction.
I
am
certain
of
the
reason
why
this
section
is
such
a
foreboding
obstacle
to
a
finished
paper;
introductions
focus
a
paper,
narrow
it,
and
give
the
contained
argument
direction.
Initially,
I
looked
at
the
paper
topic
and
was
a
little
confused.
I
circled
the
phrase
"Write
like
a
WA"
and
wrote,
"What
do
you
mean?"
in
the
margin.
That
critical
nature
is
part
of
the
WA
in
me.
It
helps
me
to
understand
the
topic
and
focus
my
argument.
Before
the
question
"What
do
you
mean?"
the
focus
of
my
paper
was
flopping
in
the
breeze.
Initially,
I
thought
that
"Writing
like
a
WA"
could
be
interpreted
as
handing
in
7
pages
containing
a
paragon
of
the
English
language--as
though
my
writing,
being
a
WA
and
all,
was
supposed
to
be
impeccably
sweet
and
melodious;
I
do
not
think
that
is
the
case.
Instead,
"Writing
like
a
WA"
probably
is
interpreted
as
being
critical
and
questioning.
I
am
supposed
to
ask
questions
and
attempt
to
understand
a
problem,
regardless
of
the
identity/credentials
of
the
paper
topic's
author.
Approaching
a
paper
topic
in
this
manner
benefits
both
sides
equally.
Before
I
write
any
further,
there
will
be
an
apology.
Part
of
it
is
stupidity,
and
part
of
it
is
lack
of
planning.
In
the
beginning
of
the
summer,
I
discarded
all
of
my
old
conference
record
forms;
this
act
comes
back
to
haunt
me.
Oh,
how
instrumental
they
would
be
at
this
moment.
Nonetheless,
I
will
answer
the
paper
topic
according
to
my
memory,
which
will
probably
lack
the
subtle
intricacies
of
anything
written
down.
Not
that
writing
from
memory
will
denigrate
my
paper;
instead,
it
will
probably
force
me
to
focus
on
the
larger
or
global
picture
instead
of
particular
instances
of
my
own
WA
experience.
The
topic
for
this
year's
paper
is
perfect,
which
contrasts
greatly
with
last
year.
Between
my
sophomore
and
junior
year,
writing
the
summer
paper
was
incredibly
difficult.
My
only
experience
in
the
WA
realm
was
Political
Theory,
and
it
was
a
warped
experienced
at
best.
I
delved
deeply
into
the
necessary
mechanics
of
writing
a
good
political
theory
paper.
Here
is
an
excerpt
from
last
year's
paper:
"The
course
is
like
none
other.
It
can
be
easily
likened
to
writing
psychological
papers
in
APA
style.
In
short,
the
writing
itself
is
fastidious.
Normally
accepted
methods
of
writing
a
paper
are
forgotten
in
political
theory.
It
is
a
different
universe,
where
prior
rules
do
not
apply."
I
suppose
that
I
still
believe
this;
I
have
yet
to
understand
the
proper
way
to
write
a
political
theory
paper--let
alone
assist
other
struggling
students
with
writing
political
theory
papers.
If
I
still
believe
anything,
it
is
that
political
theory
writing
is
fastidious.
Professor
Miller
was
never
fully
pleased
with
my
contribution.
He
would
repeatedly
say
that
the
papers
were
written
well,
but
he
would
maintain
that
none
were
focused
adequately.
The
whole
experience
was
rather
frustrating.
My
experience
in
the
1999-2000
year
was
a
little
of
both
worlds.
In
the
fall
semester,
I
was
again
a
WA
for
Professor
Miller's
Political
Theory,
and
I
was
again
uncertain
of
how
to
best
contribute
to
the
papers.
One
instance
comes
to
mind.
When
I
met
the
class
for
the
first
time,
I
warned
them
about
the
different
writing
style
involved.
I
said
that
the
format
of
the
papers
was
different
than
other
forms
of
writing
and
told
the
class
not
to
worry
excessively.
Professor
Miller
immediately
said
to
me
in
front
of
the
class
"Art,
we're
going
to
have
to
work
on
these
introductions."
I
questioned
him
about
it
later,
and
he
explained
that
the
writing
style
was
not
much
different
than
other
classes;
I
never
believed
that.
My
conferences
with
the
students
only
revealed
the
truth
of
my
initial
warning.
One
student
comes
to
mind.
She
is
a
fellow
Government
and
Law
major
with
excellent
academic
standing
and
unmistakably
good
writing
skills.
However,
despite
all
these
attributes,
she
still
struggled
with
the
papers.
She
would
call
me
at
11:00PM
to
discuss
the
paper,
which
was
not
due
for
another
three
days.
I
attempted
to
focus
her
paper
into
a
workable
thesis.
She
then
decided
to
take
this
narrowed
thesis
to
Professor
Miller
the
next
day.
Once
again,
she
called
me
late
the
next
night
and
expressed
her
discontent
with
the
course
and
with
Professor
Miller's
contribution
to
it.
I
asked
why,
and
she
told
me
that
she
scrapped
her
6
pages
because
Professor
Miller
said
that
it
was
not
adequately
narrowed.
Unfortunately,
the
majority
of
my
WA
conferences
did
not
focus
on
the
body
of
the
paper.
I
spent
all
of
my
effort
on
focusing
and
narrowing
the
thesis,
which
I
could
not
effectively
do
anyway.
Once
again,
it
was
frustrating.
Each
conference
would
usually
have
a
2-5minute
conversation
that
would
focus
on
Professor
Miller
and
not
the
paper
or
the
thesis.
More
or
less,
I
felt
like
a
partner
in
crime
against
the
Political
Theory
police
with
Professor
Miller
at
its
head.
When
I
received
my
spring
2000
assignment,
I
was
unsure
of
the
reasons
why
I
did
not
receive
the
same
assignment.
Professor
Miller
still
taught
Political
Theory,
but
he
had
a
different
WA.
In
the
spring,
he
did
not
speak
to
me
much.
Usually,
we
would
converse
if
we
ran
into
each
other.
Such
was
not
the
case
now.
I
would
greet
him
on
campus
and
attempt
to
initiate
a
conversation
about
his
sabbatical,
but
he
would
immediately
turn
the
other
way
after
greeting
me
and
go
about
his
business.
I
asked
myself
if
the
reason
for
my
different
assignment
stemmed
from
my
desire
to
WA
for
another
class
or
if
it
stemmed
from
a
WA-Professor
relationship
that
was
excessively
antagonistic.
I
am
unsure.
Either
way,
in
the
Spring
2000,
I
received
a
new
assignment.
It
was
a
VAST
course
"The
Development
of
the
Bomber,"
which
Professor
Lammers
taught.
The
bomber
course
was
different
in
that
it
was
not
the
same
course,
which
is
an
obvious
though
necessary
point
to
make.
For
three
straight
semesters,
Political
Theory
was
my
only
experience
with
being
a
WA.
Thank
God
that
changed.
Professor
Lammers
differed
greatly
from
Professor
Miller.
He
was
open
to
suggestions,
and
he
welcomed
more
of
my
input
than
Professor
Miller
did.
My
first
round
of
conferences
began
with
a
2-page
summary
of
a
possible
paper
topic
and
"Why
it
interested
the
individual
student."
Professor
Lammers
explained
his
justification
for
such
an
assignment.
The
purpose
was
to
spark
an
interest
in
the
student
about
a
paper
topic.
The
final
paper
must
be
20
pages
in
length,
which
is
rather
tedious
when
the
student
has
no
interest
in
the
paper
topic.
The
assignment
was
an
attempt
to
begin
the
writing
process
and
surface
a
possible
thesis,
which,
most
importantly,
interested
the
student.
Surprisingly
enough,
the
majority
of
the
students
came
to
the
conference
with
nothing
of
the
sort.
They
talked
about
the
technological
advancements
in
bombers;
however,
they
failed
to
include
the
essential
ingredient:
why
it
interested
them.
I
was
able
to
quickly
recognize
this
problem
and
explain
to
each
student
the
need
to
write
about
his
or
her
interests.
Consequently,
the
first
round
of
conferences
went
smoothly,
and
Professor
Lammers
was
pleased.
With
the
bomber
course,
I
experimented
with
other
meeting
spots.
Instead
of
strictly
using
Pardee
319,
I
would
also
have
some
conferences
in
Gilbert's
and
Farinon.
I
would
encourage
other
students
to
grab
food
and
relax.
Pardee
319
can
sometimes
become
loud
and
create
an
intimidating
atmosphere
for
the
students.
I
think
the
new
meeting
spots
worked
well.
However,
not
everything
worked
well.
Professor
Lammers
would
instruct
the
students
to
hand
in
their
papers
24
hours
before
their
conference.
He
coupled
this
with
the
expressed
policy
of
giving
zeros
to
students
who
miss
their
meetings.
These
two
policies
were
a
dangerous
mix.
The
spring
2000
semester
was
not
only
my
most
difficult
academically,
but
it
was
also
my
most
difficult
to
plan.
I
held
three
jobs
simultaneously
along
with
varsity
track.
I
worked
in
Bethlehem
at
a
restaurant,
was
a
WA
for
the
English
department,
and
worked
in
Kirby
Library.
All
of
this
had
to
be
scheduled
and
planned.
Such
planning
became
incredibly
difficult
during
crunch-week.
I
found
myself
removing
allocated
sleep
time
in
order
to
fit
conferences.
The
24
hours
in
advance
rule
was
intended
to
give
me
adequate
time
to
read
most
papers
before
the
scheduled
conferences.
Unfortunately,
students
interpreted
the
24-hour
rule
as
the
"night
before
rule."
I
intended
to
read
most
of
the
papers
at
work,
since
I
had
a
lot
of
down
time.
However,
many
students
would
give
me
their
papers
for
an
8:00AM
conference
at
6:00PM
the
night
before.
During
that
time,
I
was
at
work.
This
put
me
at
an
impasse.
I
could
either
refuse
the
conferences
to
such
individuals
and
report
the
problem
to
Professor
Lammers
or
I
could
create
nonexistent
time
to
reschedule
the
conferences.
The
former
option
would
probably
alienate
me
from
the
students
and
create
an
unfavorable
atmosphere;
however,
the
later
option
would
probably
hurt
my
own
academics.
I
chose
the
later,
which
I
now
regret.
I
would
suggest
to
new
WA
s
that
personal
academics
always
should
come
before
rescheduling.
In
a
demanding
academic
year,
one
fair
chance
is
ample
opportunity
for
a
student;
anything
more
only
hurts
you.
Aside
from
the
rescheduling
problem,
I
had
difficulty
with
only
one
student,
but
the
difficulty
faded
as
the
rounds
of
conferences
progressed.
In
short,
the
student
was
an
excellent
writer,
and
I
had
difficulty
being
critical
about
the
paper.
He
answered
the
topic,
doing
it
in
an
eloquent
manner.
However,
he
immediately
said,
"This
paper
is
crap;
I
whipped
it
up
in
about
Vi
hour.
Apparently,
the
paper
was
not
"crap,"
and
his
assertion
that
it
qualified
as
such
forced
me
to
praise
his
work,
thereby
exalting
the
paper
even
more.
Not
one
word
of
criticism
exited
my
mouth.
Only
praise
flowed
out.
However,
through
the
conferences,
I
was
able
to
take
the
necessary
praise
and
use
it
critically.
I
would
identify
particular
passages
that
spoke
well
to
the
thesis
and
ask
him
to
expand
upon
such
passages.
The
tactic
worked
well.
Ironically,
the
worst
conferences
are
with
the
best
writers
and
vice
versa.
When
I
enter
a
round
of
conferences,
I
expect
there
to
be
errors.
In
fact,
I
welcome
and
depend
on
those
errors.
Without
visible
error,
I
have
nothing
to
contribute
in
a
conference,
and
my
function
is
no
longer
a
critical
reader.
This
upcoming
semester
will
be,
by
far,
my
most
challenging
semester
thus
far.
I
will
be
continuing
my
three
jobs
as
well
as
varsity
track.
On
top
of
those,
I
will
be
writing
a
senior
thesis,
which
is
challenging
enough
alone.
I
suppose
that
I
can
liken
track
competition
to
writing.
People
often
ask
me,
"Why
do
you
run
if
it
hurts?"
I
would
always
reply,
"Yes,
it
hurts,
but
when
I'm
done,
such
an
immense
satisfaction
overwhelms
me."
Writing
is
similar.
The
research,
the
writing,
the
re-writing
are
all
necessary
hurdles
to
a
final
draft.
When
you
finish,
the
feeling
is
overwhelming,
and
this
feeling
will
be
exponentially
stronger
when
the
work
is
published.
I
am
sure
that
my
WA
skills,
more
specifically
my
critical
nature,
will
be
instrumental
in
the
entire
process.
