Writing
Associate
Narrative
August
28,
1995
My
first
experience
as
a
writer
began
in
fourth
grade
when
my
teacher
read
our
class
a
limerick
on
St.
Patrick's
Day
and
told
us
to
try
to
write
one
of
our
own.
I
wrote
a
poem
called
The
Silly
Leprechaun
,
which
in
my
opinion
then,
had
a
perfect
rhyme
scheme
and
detail
beyond
all
human
imagination.
I
was
so
proud
to
hand
in
my
limerick
on
the
day
it
was
due.
I
had
decorated
the
borders
of
the
wide-lined
page
with
crayon
drawings
of
shamrocks
and
pots
of
gold
at
the
end
of
rainbows.
I
remember
how
I
wrote
the
poem
over
and
over
again
at
home
in
order
to
present
Miss
Nailos
with
my
most
perfect
cursive
in
black
pen.
The
day
I
turned
it
in,
my
classmates
admired
my
creation
and
I
proudly
placed
my
work
in
the
pile
on
the
teacher's
desk.
I
was
eager
to
see
her
expression
when
she
handed
me
my
poem
back
with
an
A+.
However,
I
never
got
the
opportunity
to
hear
Miss
Nailos'
praise
because
the
day
after
we
turned
in
our
limericks
she
spilled
coffee
all
over
the
pile
on
her
desk
and
threw
the
poems
away.
She
apologized
to
the
class
but
privately,
I
never
forgave
her.
I
thought
that
the
limerick
was
my
great
achievement,
and
I
wanted
to
hear
those
words
of
encouragement.
Nevertheless,
I
decided
that
I
would
write
another
poem;
something
on
a
different
topic
and
something
that
I
could
show
to
people
and
receive
praise
for
it.
Despite
all
the
pages
of
poetry
I
have
in
my
file
cabinet
today,
I
didn't
begin
to
write
poetry
on
paper.
Poetry
began
as
a
personal
experience
within,
and
I
challenged
myself
by
trying
to
create
whole
rhyming
poems
in
my
head
and
reciting
them
walking
to
and
from
school.
Poetry
was
more
like
music
to
me.
Something
that
sounded
good
when
you
said
it
and
something
that
you
could
change
the
rhythm
of
just
by
using
the
inflections
in
your
voice.
So,
after
Miss
Nailos
destroyed
my
first
creation,
I
decided
to
write
my
own
personal
limericks
based
on
what
and
how
I
was
living.
My
first
major
topics
arose
out
of
my
love
of
nature.
I
wrote
about
horses,
flowers,
the
sun,
raindrops,
and
lightning.
A
few
years
ago,
I
looked
back
on
all
of
my
nursery
rhyme
poems
and
thought
they
seemed
shallow
in
their
descriptiveness
and
in
their
lack
of
realism.
My
poems
from
about
the
fourth
to
sixth
grade
maintain
this
very
optimistic
view
untainted
with
the
reality
of
what
it
was
really
like
to
grow
up
as
a
black
girl
in
a
predominantly
white
suburb
of
Philadelphia.
Now,
at
an
older
age,
I
look
back
at
my
writings
and
understand
that
they
were
reality
for
me
when
I
was
trying
to
escape
everything
around
me.
I
also
understand
that
I
wasn't
just
talking
about
trees
and
the
moon
but
I
was
making
metaphors
out
of
the
mind
of
a
little
girl.
As
a
ten
or
twelve
year
old,
I
would
describe
horses
but
I
would
always
say
they
were
like
something
or
they
reminded
me
of
a
bigger
principle
of
life.
Simple
principles
like
freedom
or
justice
that
get
complicated
when
ignored.
To
me
then,
freedom
was
like
a
horse
because
there
is
an
aspect
of
being
free
that
is
undomesticated
and
untamed
and
exaggerated
but
also
an
aspect
of
being
beautiful,
graceful,
and
poised.
And
when
I
understand
that
about
my
fifth
grade
poems,
I
am
rather
proud
that
I
was
able
to
tackle
principles
that
few
adults
seem
to
give
much
thought
too.
During
middle
school,
there
were
people
such
as
teachers,
school
administrators,
and
especially
my
mother
who
had
discovered
I
had
a
talent
for
writing
and
that
I
should
be
given
the
chance
to
expand
on
my
abilities.
I
was
given
a
scholarship
to
take
a
two
week
workshop
at
the
University
of
Pennsylvania
Discovery
Program
for
Young
Writers.
I
was
a
young
writer
but
the
only
problem
was
that
I
was
the
youngest
writer
in
my
poetry
class.
All
the
students
that
pulled
their
chairs
into
the
writing
circle
that
first
day
of
class
were
either
sophomores,
juniors,
or
seniors
in
highschool,
and
I
had
not
even
begun
the
sixth
grade.
Instantly,
I
felt
out
of
place
and
immature.
They
talked
about
Joyce
Carol
Oates,
Fitzgerald,
and
Edgar
Allen
Poe
and
passed
around
books
like
the
Catcher
and
the
Rye
and
The
Grapes
of
Wrath.
I
can
barely
remember
what
I
was
reading
in
sixth
grade
but
it
was
none
of
those
books.
I
was
intimidated
for
the
first
two
days
of
class
but
then
I
began
to
feel
a
little
bit
more
relaxed
because
I
could
sit
back,
listen,
and
learn
something
from
these
older
kids.
I
learned
how
to
analyze
poems
even
though
I
didn't
completely
understand
them
and
how
to
mark
up
a
copy
with
my
own
interpretations.
I
looked
around
the
room
one
class
day
and
saw
how
everyone
carried
a
notebook
to
write
their
poems
in,
I
abandoned
my
looseleaf
pieces
of
paper
and
asked
my
mother
for
money
to
but
a
spiral
Mead
notebook.
By
the
end
of
the
two
weeks,
I
wasn't
afraid
to
read
my
poems
in
front
of
the
class
and
I
was
no
longer
afraid
to
talk
about
the
real
things
going
on
in
my
life.
Things
had
changed
since
the
first
day
of
class
when
I
wrote
about
sunshine
and
thunder.
The
last
day
of
class,
I
was
writing
about
my
grandmother
scrubbing
church
pews.
During
the
workshop,
I
also
got
my
first
taste
of
criticism
and
praise
from
other
writers.
There
were
two
girls
in
my
class,
Jory
and
Kellie
who
were
going
to
be
juniors
in
highschool
who
said
I
had
an
incredible
eye
for
description
and
a
great
sense
of
perception.
I
didn't
really
know
what
that
meant
but
I
did
understand
when
they
started
to
call
me
a
little
Alice
Walker
.
I
liked
the
sound
of
that
because
Alice
Walker
was
a
role
model
for
me,
and
as
my
writing
progressed
that
summer,
I
strove
to
be
the
kind
of
smart-assed
and
self-assured
writer
she
was.
After
my
mother
saw
how
much
I
liked
the
workshop,
she
continued
to
put
me
in
the
program,
at
her
own
expense.
She
bought
me
Alice
Walker's
books,
as
well
as
many
others
by
DuBois,
Wright,
Angelou,
and
Morrison.
Even
my
relatives
participated
in
my
development
as
an
educated
writer.
My
aunt
Tab
gave
me
a
thick
book
of
Shakespeare's
sonnets
and
poems
for
Christmas
when
I
was
in
seventh
grade,
although
she
understood
nothing
about
Shakespeare.
My
mom
loved
to
hear
me
read
my
poems
and
she
would
take
copies
of
them
to
her
job
to
show
them
to
her
coworkers.
Whenever
there
was
a
family
get
together,
I
read
a
poem.
If
someone
in
the
family
got
married
or
passed
away,
I
wrote
a
poem
about
it.
By
the
time
I
finished
7th
grade,
I
must
have
accumulate
about
fifty
to
sixty
poems,
all
embellished
by
the
experiences
of
a
adolescent
African-American
female
whose
father
was
a
drunk
and
whose
school
life
was
clouded
with
racism.
When
I
got
to
highschool,
I
discovered
that
I
couldn't
just
write
poems
for
assignments--I
had
to
learn
how
to
write
good
compositions,
essays,
and
summaries.
This
was
hard
for
me
because
I
had
become
very
good
at
analyzing
situations
and
writings
but
I
found
it
hard
to
stick
to
the
topic
that
was
assigned.
However,
I
believe
I
was
lucky
when
I
was
selected
to
participate
in
a
program
in
eighth
and
ninth
grade
called
the
Interdisciplinary
Program
for
Gifted
Students.
For
three
to
four
hours
of
the
day,
students
in
the
program
received
training
in
English,
social
studies,
and
science.
The
teachers
were
of
a
very
high
caliber
but
the
program
was
loosely
defined
which
was
a
great
idea
to
teach
the
students
how
to
discipline
themselves
and
be
as
creative
as
they
wanted
to
be.
My
English
teacher
in
the
program,
Mr.
Romano,
taught
me
how
to
tailor
my
details
and
ideas
to
the
assigned
topic
and
produce
a
composition
that
was
both
creative
and
expository.
His
help
aided
me
so
much
that
in
ninth
grade
I
received
no
grade
lower
than
a
100%
on
every
composition
I
wrote,
and
from
that
point
on,
I
was
able
to
find
a
writing
style
that
wouldn't
make
me
sacrifice
my
creative
abilities.
The
remainder
of
highschool,
from
10th
to
12th
grade
were
my
most
spectacular
writing
years
because
I
was
very
prolific
during
both
the
school
year
and
the
summer.
I
entered
as
many
writing
contests
as
possible
and
won
a
great
majority
of
them.
My
teachers
regarded
me
as
very
talented
and
my
mother
was
still
very
supportive.
But
what
I
found
to
be
the
most
satisfying
was
the
praise
from
my
peers
and
their
deeming
of
me
as
the
Poet
Laureate
of
North
Penn
High
School.
I
had
a
reputation
for
being
a
creative
person
and
I
enjoyed
it.
When
there
was
a
school
assembly
or
award
ceremony,
I
was
asked
to
read
a
poem.
My
poems
were
published
in
school
and
public
papers
and
in
my
junior
year
the
local
newspaper,
published
one
of
my
poems
on
the
front
page
of
the
paper
and
called
me
North
Penn's
Poet
Prodigy.
I
loved
the
praise
but
my
family
and
friends
never
let
me
get
bigheaded
about
it.
My
mother
always
told
me
that
I
could
write
a
better
poem
than
the
last.
My
teachers
challenged
me
to
attempt
new
topics
and
new
styles.
Where
highschool
taught
me
see
all
the
capabilities
I
had
as
a
writer,
college
made
me
see
my
weaknesses.
In
my
English
classes
at
Lafayette,
I
didn't
have
as
many
opportunities
to
write
poems
for
assignments
so
I
was
forced
to
try
to
make
a
significant
impression
with
expository
writing.
It
was
difficult
for
me
at
first
because
I
didn't
know
what
my
professors
would
expect.
I
was
so
used
to
teachers
knowing
what
I
could
do
and
expecting
a
level
of
writing
that
was
easy
for
me
to
achieve.
At
college,
I
had
to
reevaluate
my
own
expectations
of
how
I
wanted
to
progress
as
a
writer
and
I
discovered
that
in
order
to
progress
as
a
writer
I
would
have
to
read
more.
When
I
first
moved
into
my
dorm
room,
the
only
books
I
put
on
the
shelf
above
my
desk
were
books
by
African-American
females,
simply
because
I
had
never
exposed
myself
to
any
other
kind
of
style
or
genre.
Taking
a
first
year
seminar
on
poetry,
an
American
literature
class,
and
a
20th
century
playwrighting
class,
really
opened
me
up
to
whole
race
of
writers
from
different
parts
of
the
world
and
different
eras.
I
found
myself
just
as
lost
in
Faulkner
as
I
was
in
Alice
Walker,
and
just
as
emersed
in
Tennessee
Williams
as
I
was
in
Lorraine
Hansberry.
Although
I
still
continued
to
write
from
the
vantage
point
of
a
Black
female,
my
writing
was
no
longer
limited
to
a
certain
style
or
format.
I
experiment
with
line
arrangements,
metaphors,
and
titles
and
even
tried
my
hand
at
short
stories
and
plays.
Lafayette
also
exposed
me
to
one
of
the
more
tangible
side
of
writing-forming
relationships
with
other
writers.
I
participated
in
poetry
readings
on
the
steps
of
Farinon,
in
Hill
of
Beans,
in
the
Marlo
Room
and
even
in
downtown
Easton
during
my
freshman
year.
I
exchanged
poems
with
other
writers,
teamed
up
with
other
poets
to
present
at
the
Fringe
Festival,
and
discussed
the
theories
and
ideas
behind
some
of
the
most
inspiring
writers
in
the
world
with
other
students
on
the
Quad.
I
established
a
reputation
at
Lafayette
for
being
a
good
writer,
much
like
the
one
I
had
in
highschool,
except
this
time,
I
didn't
feel
alone
or
isolated
from
other
poets,
playwrights,
or
short
story
writers.
At
Lafayette,
I
felt
as
if
I
was
a
member
of
a
community
of
writers,
which
includes
both
students
and
professors.
Now,
whenever
I
meet
someone
for
the
first
time,
I
always
tell
them
that
I
am
a
writer.
That
is
because
writing
is
such
an
essential
part
of
my
life
that
it
keeps
me
alive
and
helps
me
to
survive
the
pain
of
being
a
minority,
a
woman,
a
youth,
and
a
dreamer.
I
still
dream
up
poems
in
my
head
like
I
used
to
do
in
fifth
grade,
but
through
highschool
and
a
year
of
college,
I
have
discovered
that
as
a
writer,
I
have
the
power
to
reach
people
through
poetry.
I
also
have
the
power
to
combine
aspects
of
my
life,
such
as
music,
and
art
with
my
poetry.
I
used
to
be
jealous
of
artists,
actors,
and
musicians
because
they
were
always
perfecting
their
craft,
until
I
discovered
that
I,
too,
was
an
artist,
and
that
my
craft
was
writing,
and
that
I
could
perfect
it
through
living
life.
It
is
a
special
thing
to
me
to
be
a
poet
and
to
be
able
to
describe
something
beautiful,
strange,
ugly,
or
sad
and
to
be
able
to
create
a
world
out
of
one
that
already
exists.
