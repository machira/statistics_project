Literacy
Narrative
Summer
2010
My
literacy
narrative
for
this
past
year,
my
junior
year
at
Lafayette,
reflects
on
my
writing
experiences
in
two
different
settings:
Lafayette
College
and
the
University
of
Auckland.
The
first
semester
of
my
junior
year
at
Lafayette
was
the
most
challenging
semester
I
have
taken
thus
far.
Three
of
my
four
courses
were
Nwriting
intensiveO
and
demanded
weekly
written
assignments.
Despite
the
amount
of
work
required,
these
three
classes
turned
out
to
be
some
of
the
best
classes
I
have
taken
at
Lafayette.
Each
class
changed
the
way
that
IOve
thought
about
my
writing
and
has
changed
my
writing
craft.
The
second
part
of
my
writing
narrative
addresses
my
second
semester
which
I
spent
in
New
Zealand.
Taking
writing
classes
in
New
Zealand
was
a
completely
different
experience;
one
that
made
me
appreciate
my
classes
and
professors
at
Lafayette.
One
of
the
classes
that
I
took
during
the
first
semester
of
my
junior
year
was
History
315:
Nation
Building:
Iraq,
Vietnam,
and
Japan.
The
class
sought
to
examine
the
similarities
and
differences
between
the
nation-building
campaigns
that
took
place
in
Japan
and
Vietnam
and
their
relevance
to
United
States
nation-building
in
Iraq.
The
colloquium
course
required
intensive
reading
and
writing
assignments.
We
were
typically
assigned
half
a
book
(approximately
200
pages)
a
week
to
read
and
analyze
for
key
events.
We
were
then
asked
to
create
a
time
line
of
the
top
5
most
significant
events
from
our
reading.
At
the
end
of
the
semester
the
timelines
were
compiled
in
order
to
help
us
write
our
final
essays.
I
found
my
final
essay
in
that
class
to
be
very
challenging
to
write.
It
required
us
to
answer
10
different
questions
while
referring
to
all
of
the
books
we
had
analyzed
throughout
the
semester.
The
prompt
itself
was
intimidating,
amounting
to
about
2
pages
of
1a,
1bE2a,
2c,
etc.
questions.
Though
the
essay
was
difficult
to
write
I
found
that
it
was
enjoyable
and
challenged
my
organizational
skills.
I
managed
to
discuss
the
complexities
of
the
War
in
Iraq
while
creating
an
overall
thesis
that
reflected
how
the
situations
in
Japan,
Vietnam,
and
Iraq
were
all
similar
(and
that
lessons
could
be
applied
from
past
wars
to
the
current
conflict
going
on
in
Iraq).
Another
essay
that
I
wrote
during
that
class
asked
us
to
analyze
primary
sources
and
how
they
effect
our
interpretation
of
historical
events.
We
analyzed
how
different
mediums,
i.e.
film,
documentary,
and
memoir
conveyed
the
same
historical
event.
The
other
history
class
that
I
took
during
my
first
semester
was
History
374:
French
Politics
and
the
Arts
1919-1945.
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
class
and
it
proved
to
be
a
great
chance
to
practice
my
writing.
Each
week
we
had
to
submit
a
five
page
journal
entry
that
reflected
on
our
thoughts
and
feelings
about
the
weekOs
readings.
What
I
liked
about
the
journals
was
that
they
forced
us
to
analyze
how
the
readings
affected
us
personally.
Though
we
would
read
approximately
300
pages
a
week
(the
class
met
once
a
week,
every
Tuesday
night),
we
would
wind
up
choosing
only
3-4
events/passages
to
write
about.
These
events
or
passages
were
usually
the
things
that
we
found
most
interesting
or
the
parts
of
the
readings
that
spoke
to
us
on
a
personal
level.
Writing
the
five
page
journal
entries
seemed
like
a
lot,
in
addition
to
the
class
readings
and
my
other
course
work,
but
in
retrospect
it
was
good
exercise
and
practice
for
me.
In
addition
to
the
journal
entries
we
had
a
mid-term
essay
to
write
on
all
of
the
course
materials
(approximately
12
pages
in
length)
and
a
semester
long
final
essay.
I
chose
to
write
my
final
essay
on
the
Maginot
Line
(French
defense
during
WWII)
and
its
ideological
conception
following
the
realities
of
the
First
World
War.
I
truly
loved
writing
this
essay
and
was
very
proud
of
my
final
piece.
I
concluded
that
although
the
Maginot
Line
is
seen
as
a
military
folly,
it
was
actually
a
success
given
its
original
purposes.
In
writing
our
final
essays
we
had
to
utilize
primary
sources,
which
I
found
somewhat
difficult
considering
that
many
primary
resources
were
in
French.
In
the
end
I
was
able
to
find
a
book
written
about
the
Line
in
the
1940s
as
well
as
many
New
York
Times
articles
that
discussed
rumors
about
the
Line
during
its
creation
and
instatement.
I
juxtaposed
these
News
Reports
with
facts
about
the
Line
and
some
original
military
maps
and
plans
that
the
French
used
in
building
it.
What
I
learned
through
writing
this
essay
was
that
I
could
really
enjoy
writing
historical
pieces
such
as
this.
Another
influential
writing
project
that
I
completed
during
my
first
semester
was
one
on
Coltan
mining
in
the
Democratic
Republic
of
Congo.
This
was
for
another
history
class
that
I
took:
History
of
Human
Rights
in
Africa.
For
our
final
assignment
we
were
asked
to
choose
an
African
human
rights
issue
(past
or
present)
and
hand
in
a
project
that
showed
our
understanding
of
the
issue.
We
were
allowed
to
utilize
any
kind
of
medium
that
we
found
would
best
communicate
our
understanding,
and
that
can
potentially
prove
useful
for
teaching
the
issue
to
others.
Although
many
people
remarked
that
it
was
childish
for
us
to
be
able
to
create
Jeopardy
Games,
board-games
and
songs,
I
thought
that
allowing
us
to
completely
the
assignment
creatively
was
much
more
useful.
Post-graduation,
most
of
us
writers
will
not
be
seeking
jobs
that
ask
us
to
answer
a
question
in
essay
form
in
1000
words.
For
my
final
project
I
chose
to
do
an
informational
brochure
explaining
the
Coltan
Human
Rights
issue
currently
going
on
in
The
D.R.C.
I
found
this
kind
of
writing
to
be
much
more
fun
and
productive
than
simply
writing
an
expository
or
argumentative
essay.
It
gave
me
practice
in
addressing
a
specific
audience
(fellow
college
peers)
about
an
issue
that
was
pertinent
and
relevant
to
their
actions
and
consumption
habits.
I
could
see
myself
using
my
writing
skills
for
productive
and
important
causes
like
this
in
the
future.
My
fourth
class
that
I
took
during
my
first
semester,
Writing
Genres:
Life
Writing,
had
the
greatest
effect
on
my
writing
out
of
all
of
the
classes
I
have
ever
taken
at
Lafayette.
In
this
class
we
learned
what
makes
an
autobiography
or
memoir
worth
reading;
what
makes
somewhat
ordinary
events
readable
and
compelling
to
another
person.
In
this
class
I
wrote
four
final
memoirs.
What
I
appreciated
about
this
class
was
the
emphasis
on
draft
writing.
Before
a
memoir
could
be
considered
a
OfinalO
memoir
it
would
have
had
to
be
in
its
third
of
fourth
final
draft.
At
least
one
draft
of
each
work
would
be
given
to
the
class.
Each
class
member
would
write
a
1-2
page
reaction
to
the
piece
and
then
share
their
feelings
and
suggestions
during
the
class
period.
At
first
I
was
intimidated
by
the
fact
that
we
had
to
share
our
draft
memoirs
with
other
people
because
the
events
that
I
wrote
about
were
very
personal
to
me.
Because
honesty
is
essential
to
the
success
of
the
piece,
I
felt
even
more
vulnerable
in
front
of
my
class
members.
Despite
my
original
discomfort,
by
the
end
of
the
semester
I
was
more
than
comfortable
sharing
my
work
with
others.
I
think
acquiring
that
skill
is
very
important,
especially
considering
going
into
the
writing
profession,
where
personal
work
is
also
critiqued
by
peers
and
editors.
I
learned
to
be
comfortable
with
my
writing
and
with
sharing
my
personal
experiences
with
others.
Also
noteworthy
about
my
writing
experiences
during
my
first
semester,
was
my
WA
position
at
ProJect
of
Easton.
That
semester
we
made
the
transition
from
group
classes
to
individualized,
one-on-one
meetings.
I
thought
this
was
much
more
effective
than
teaching
a
class
because
of
the
varying
levels
of
literacy.
I
could
address
specific
problems
and
questions
in
the
one-on-one
meetings
and
better
connect
with
my
students.
I
had
some
very
profound
experiences
that
semester
as
well.
I
found
a
man
who
had
always
been
told
that
his
writing
was
no
sufficient,
etc.
because
he
could
not
tackle
a
5
paragraph
essay.
The
truth
was,
that
this
man,
who
was
42
and
had
dropped
out
of
high
school
at
the
age
of
15,
was
far
better
than
the
coveted
5
paragraph
essay.
He
was
in
fact
an
extremely
talented
creative
writer,
who
had
skills
that
far
surpassed
those
that
are
required
to
write
a
GED
essay.
His
prose
had
feeling
and
emotion,
and
was
so
descriptive
that
I
felt
the
emotions
that
he
had
penned.
I
have
always
felt
that
writing
is
not
something
that
can
be
taught.
Just
like
some
people
are
born
singers,
or
painters,
some
people
are
just
naturally
gifted
and
amount
of
training
and
practice
can
turn
them
into
a
prodigy,
someone
truly
great.
This
man,
at
the
age
of
42Nsitting
at
a
literacy
center
and
talking
to
an
inexperienced
and
many
ways
ignorant
20
year
oldNwas
a
born
and
natural
writer,
and
no
amount
of
criticism
could
ever
take
that
away
from
him.
Just
like
some
people
can
touch
others
with
the
sound
of
their
voice,
or
the
strokes
that
they
paint,
writing
is
a
different
kind
of
painting
and
a
different
kind
of
song.
Writing
at
Lafayette
and
writing
at
the
University
of
Auckland,
while
studying
abroad
in
New
Zealand,
were
two
very
different
experiences.
To
begin
with,
the
class
sizes,
instead
of
an
average
of
25
students,
are
over
400
students
per
class.
Playing
into
the
classic
college
lingo
clich,
I
finally
knew
what
it
felt
like
to
be
a
number.
Forget
about
a
professor
knowing
your
name,
you
had
to
first
have
a
professor.
One
of
the
most
prestigious
universities
in
the
world,
at
University
of
Auckland,
you
are
not
even
guaranteed
to
have
a
coveted
NprofessorO,
rather
you
are
most
likely
to
be
in
a
class
where
you
have
a
lecturer
(although
most
classes
have
many
lecturers,
that
switch
off
making
it
hard
to
have
any
kind
of
consistency).
Lecturers
never
even
get
to
see
your
papers
because
that
is
not
in
their
job
description.
You
NtutorO,
who
is
someone
your
ageNand
who
IOve
noticed
is
most
inclined
to
hate
AmericansNgrades
your
papers,
subjectively
at
best.
I
did
not
have
the
best
luck
with
my
tutors,
nor
was
I
prepared
for
the
kind
of
writing
I
would
do
while
I
was
abroad.
Tutors
are
not
concerned
with
the
quality
of
your
writing,
but
rather
with
how
quickly
they
can
see
that
you
know
key
terms.
Word
limits
are
tantamount
and
you
face
grade
deductions
if
you
go
over
the
world
limit.
I
have
never
written
with
such
strict
word
limits
and
I
found
it
insanely
difficult
to
adjust.
I
was,
on
average,
exceeding
the
word
limit
by
1000
words.
I
had
to
take
out
my
fancy
introduction
sentences
and
witty
transitions
so
that
I
could
get
straight
to
the
point,
to
the
facts.
At
first,
I
refused
to
do
this,
I
left
in
my
pretty
little
sentences
(that
would
have
impressed
my
professors
at
home),
and
paid
the
price.
What
I
found
the
most
difficult
to
adjust
to
was
the
amount
of
sources
we
were
required
to
cite
in
our
essays.
One
of
the
first
essays
that
I
wrote
in
New
Zealand
required
that
I
cite
10
sourcesEfor
a
3
page
essay.
Even
more
troublesome
was
having
to
include
20
sources
in
a
6
page
essay.
I
spent
the
bulk
of
my
writing
time
trying
to
figure
out
how
I
was
going
to
incorporate
such
a
great
amount
of
sources.
What
also
bothered
me
about
writing
in
at
the
University
of
Auckland
was
that
it
always
felt
like
no
one
was
actually
reading
my
essays.
When
I
received
a
B+
on
one
of
my
history
essays
because
I
Nlacked
citationsO
I
went
in
to
speak
to
the
tutor.
After
showing
her
all
the
places
where
I
did
cite
she
remarked
Noh,
I
must
not
have
seen
themO
and
raised
my
grade
half
a
letter.
It
was
frustrating
to
me
that
I
was
expected
to
put
work
into
my
assignments
but
no
one
was
actually
even
reading
them.
My
semester
abroad
really
made
me
appreciate
attending
a
small
liberal
arts
college
where
I
am
more
than
just
a
number.
I
appreciate
the
fact
that
I
have
professors
who
take
the
time
to
read
my
essays
and
make
comments
that
help
me
better
my
writing.
I
probably
would
have
abandoned
my
love
of
writing
a
long
time
ago
if
I
had
attended
a
larger
university
that
didnOt
appreciate
its
relevance
or
importance.
