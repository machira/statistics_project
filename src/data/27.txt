The
Evolution
of
My
Writing
(So
Far)
Those
were
the
days.
Kindergarten--we
woke
up
late
and
went
to
school
for
half
days,
most
of
which
were
spent
playing
with
friends
and
listening
to
stories.
No
homework
was
assigned
and
the
most
difficult
writing
encountered
was
learning
how
to
form
the
letters
of
the
alphabet,
The
upper-case
letters
had
to
take
up
the
entire
space
between
two
solid
lines,
while
the
lower-case
letters
were
only
to
reach
the
dotted
line
that
lay
half-way
between
the
two
solid
lines.
Letters
were
sometimes
written
backwards
or
in
the
wrong
order,
but
eventually
they
were
mastered.
Although
my
early
years
in
school
seem
distant,
even
blurry,
I
can
still
see
the
brown/grey
paper
with
turquoise
lines
on
which
I
learned
to
write
the
letters
of
the
alphabet.
Those
sheets
of
paper,
dark,
smudgy
graphite,
and
the
alphabet
combine
to
form
my
earliest
memory
of
writing.
The
summer
following
kindergarten
my
parents
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
teaching
me
to
spell
and
write
my
name,
along
with
many
words.
When
I
got
to
first
grade,
I
already
knew
much
of
what
we
learned
in
the
first
few
months.
I
remember
being
particularly
proud
that
I
knew
the
correct
spelling
of
was
before
the
rest
of
my
classmates
did,
Unfortunately,
that's
the
extent
of
what
I
am
able
to
recall
about
my
first
grade
writing
experiences.
During
second
grade
I
learned
to
write
letters
to
friends,
my
parents,
and
Santa
Claus;
then
I
was
taught
how
to
address
envelopes
so
I
could
mail
the
letters.
These
writing
activities
were
exciting
because
I
was
doing
things
that
grown-ups
could
do,
In
addition,
I
learned
how
to
write
using
cursive
letters,
I
remember
my
friends
and
I
being
quite
excited
about
learning
cursive
because
the
sixth-graders
and
our
parents
usually
wrote
in
cursive.
Ironically,
I
now
prefer
to
print;
if
I
were
asked
to
write
the
entire
alphabet,
both
upper
and
lower-case
in
cursive
I
seriously
doubt
I
could
do
it,
While
my
memory
of
how
the
cursive
alphabet
looks
isn't
the
greatest,
I
can
recall
being
asked
to
write
quite
a
few
reports
during
my
fourth
grade
year,
I
enjoyed
writing
reports
because
they
were
usually
book
reports
and
fourth
grade
was
the
year
that
I
became
an
avid
reader,
I
believe
my
love
for
reading
stems
from
the
stories
that
my
father
read
to
me
and
my
brother.
My
father
didn't
just
read
us
bedtime
stories:
he
read
us
spooky
Disney
adventure
and
mystery
stories
complete
with
sound
effects
and
different
voices
for
all
the
characters.
Thanks
to
my
father,
I
became
hooked
on
books,
Not
surprisingly,
the
amount
of
reading
I
did,
and
continue
to
do,
has
played
a
prominent
role
in
shaping
my
writing
style
and
building
my
vocabulary.
In
sixth
grade,
I
learned
to
make
oral
presentations
that
corresponded
with
reports
I
wrote,
Though
these
presentations
were
sometimes
awkward,
I
am
grateful
that
I
began
to
acquire
the
skill
of
speaking
in
front
of
my
peers
so
early,
Another
significant
item
(at
least
to
me)
in
my
literacy
history
occurred
during
sixth
grade--I
was
finally
allowed
to
take
notes
and
complete
homework
assignments
in
pen
instead
of
pencil.
I
felt
very
sophisticated
despite
the
fact
that
I
had
to
scribble
out
mistakes
and
rewrite
lots
of
assignments.
Thank
goodness
we
now
have
White-Out!
The
years
spent
in
junior
high
are
very
formative
in
terms
of
academics.
In
many
ways,
eighth
grade
was
a
turning
point
as
far
as
my
writing
is
concerned.
My
English
teacher,
Ms.
Gable,
was
wonderful,
though
I
certainly
didn't
think
so
at
the
time.
She
drilled
the
class
on
grammar
rules
and
spelling
during
the
first
half
of
the
year.
The
grammar
rules
were
not
easy
to
learn,
but
I
knew
that
they
were
important
and
worked
hard
to
commit
them
to
memory,
During
the
second
half
of
my
year
with
Ms.
Gable
I
really
learned
to
write--not
only
reports,
but
also
responses
to
literature
that
we
read.
I
found
that
I
enjoyed
writing
about
what
I
had
read;
it
provided
an
opportunity
to
ask
questions,
then
get
answers
not
from
a
teacher,
but
from
exploring
my
thoughts
about
a
work
and
coming
up
with
my
own
answers
(which
I
was
delighted
to
find
were
neither
right
nor
wrong).
That
spring,
Ms,
Gable
was
holding
a
creative
writing
workshop
after
school,
Although
I
wasn't
sure
just
what
creative
writing
was,
I
decided
to
give
it
a
try.
I
wrote
a
great
deal
of
poetry
and
many
short
stories.
I
really
liked
the
poetry
and
can
still
remember
my
favorite
poem;
it
was
about
a
frozen
pond
that
a
little
girl
enjoyed
skating
on
late
at
night,
The
poem
conjured
images
of
a
child
in
a
red
hat
and
mittens
skating
rings
around
a
lantern
in
the
middle
of
the
pond.
Big
flakes
of
snow
fell
softly
around
her,
completing
the
peaceful
image.
Unfortunately,
I
didn't
write
that
poem.
One
of
my
classmates
did.
Poetry
was
not
exactly
my
strong
suit.
My
short
stories
on
the
other
hand,
were
quite
good.
Ms.
Gable
felt
one
story
was
good
enough
to
merit
entry
into
a
writing
contest
for
students
in
grades
seven
through
nine.
Though
I
didn't
win
the
contest,
Ms.
Gable's
confidence
in
my
writing
really
meant
a
lot
to
me.
Another
important
class
in
my
literacy
history
was
eighth
grade
history.
Mr,
Bickle,
my
teacher,
wasn't
as
tough
as
Ms.
Gable,
but
one
of
his
assignments
was.
I
was
required
to
write
a
research
report
of
considerable
length,
then
give
an
oral
presentation
lasting
approximately
half
a
class
period.
I
worked
hard
and
produced
a
fifteen
page
report,
typed
(one
of
my
first
typed
reports).
I
also
gave
a
very
thorough
oral
presentation
that
included
a
question
and
answer
period.
This
project
taught
me
the
basics
of
doing
research.
I
also
came
to
realize
that
I
had
virtually
no
typing
skills
and
had
my
mother
purchase
a
typing
tutorial
program
for
our
computer.
By
my
freshman
year,
my
typing
skills
had
improved
markedly.
I
liked
my
English
teacher
and
the
material
we
covered
in
class.
Like
the
previous
year,
my
teacher
felt
I
had
talent
as
a
writer.
I
earned
very
good
grades,
and
was
quite
sure
that
my
teacher
would
recommend
taking
Language
and
Literature
III
rather
than
Language
and
Literature
II
for
the
upcoming
school
year.
Language
and
Literature
II
was
the
standard
English
course
for
sophomore
students,
while
Language
and
Literature
III
was
more
advanced
and
generally
taken
by
juniors,
I
was
surprised
and
even
a
little
hurt
when
I
was
steered
toward
Language
and
Literature
II.
During
the
first
semester
of
my
sophomore
year
I
breezed
through
Language
and
Literature
II.
The
class
was
very
boring
and
I
wasn't
challenged
in
the
least.
I
was
scheduled
to
take
Communication
Skills
during
the
second
semester
of
that
year,
Once
again,
this
was
the
standard
course
of
study
in
English
for
sophomore
students.
I
sat
through
one
day
of
Communication
Skills;
on
the
second
day
I
excused
myself
on
the
pretence
of
using
the
lavatory,
Instead
of
going
to
the
lavatory,
I
went
to
the
guidance
office
and
asked
my
counselor
to
promptly
remove
me
from
that
class.
I
was
placed
in
Advanced
Communication
Skills
(ACS),
a
class
for
juniors.
It
was
in
this
class
that
my
writing
took
off,
My
writing
improved
dramatically
in
ACS
due
to
my
teacher,
Mrs,
Krassowski,
I
had
Mrs,
Krassowski
for
two
additional
classes
during
my
high
school
career,
and
she
remains
one
of
my
favorite
teachers.
Obviously,
she
played
a
critical
role
in
my
development
as
a
writer,
In
ACS
Mrs,
Krassowski
helped
me
become
a
more
mature
writer.
For
example,
I
learned
that
it
is
not
always
appropriate
to
use
the
words
I,
you,
and
we
in
academic
writing.
In
addition
I
was
taught
how
to
use
an
opening
paragraph.
Maturity
was
not,
however,
my
only
significant
gain
from
ACS;
it
was
in
this
class
that
I
wrote
my
first
research
paper,
Mrs,
Krassowski
took
my
class
through
the
process
step-by-step,
We
chose
topics,
gathered
source
lists,
and
recorded
information
on
numbered,
labeled
note
cards.
Most
importantly,
I
learned
to
use
the
MLA
style
of
writing
a
paper
and
citing
works.
Though
that
first
MLA
paper
was
difficult
and
I
hated
every
minute
of
writing
it,
I
am
glad
that
I
had
to
do
it.
Learning
to
use
MLA
early
in
my
high
school
career
was
a
very
valuable
experience.
Lastly,
ACS
put
the
finishing
touches
on
my
oral
presentations.
Mrs.
Krassowski
was
extremely
big
on
eye
contact,
a
clear
voice,
and
no
note
cards.
I
knew
that
if
I
showed
downcast
eyes
or
had
a
quiver
in
my
voice
Mrs.
Krassowski
would
deduct
lots
of
points
from
my
presentation
scores,
I
really
had
to
work
to
produce
good
presentations;
this
was
not
because
I
didn't
have
the
skills,
but
rather
because
I
was
nervous.
My
nerves
were
the
result
of
being
in
a
class
full
of
juniors,
many
of
whom
were
cool,
After
the
first
few
presentations,
I
overcame
my
nerves
and
performed
quite
well.
Now
I
don't
have
any
problems
speaking
or
reading
in
front
of
my
peers,
Mrs,
Krassowski
really
helped
foster
my
love
of
English.
As
a
result,
I
doubled
up
on
my
English
classes
during
my
junior
year.
I
took
Survey
of
American
Literature,
my
second
course
with
Mrs.
Krassowski,
and
Research
Paper/Shakespeare's
Tragedies
with
another
influential
and
encouraging
teacher,
Mrs.
Buckendorf.
Survey
of
American
Literature
covered
exactly
what
one
would
expect
such
a
course
to
cover,
and
then
some.
The
most
important
skills
I
learned
in
this
class
were
how
to
free-write
and
how
to
keep
a
journal.
Free-writing
was
tough
for
me
because
I
had
to
do
it
at
eight
in
the
morning--not
exactly
one
of
my
peak
hours,
I
was
good
at
keeping
a
journal,
though.
The
journal
consisted
of
what
I
felt
were
key
points
or
events
in
a
novel,
and
my
responses
to
those
points
or
events,
I
found
that
I
liked
the
explorative
nature
of
keeping
a
journal
and
really
got
into
it.
I
learned
a
great
deal
about
reading,
writing,
interpreting,
and
even
about
myself
by
keeping
that
journal.
Mrs.
Krassowski
was
quite
impressed
and
wrote
some
very
flattering
and
encouraging
remarks
in
my
journal.
As
it
turns
out,
the
journal
keeping
paid
off
during
my
second
semester
here
at
Lafayette,
If
I
were
asked
to
choose
one
or
two
classes
that
I
feel
best
prepared
me
for
college,
a
prime
candidate
would
be
Research
Paper.
It
was
a
superb
class
that
I
would
recommend
to
any
student
who
has
the
opportunity
to
take
such
a
course,
Research
Paper
made
me
absolutely
comfortable
and
confident
in
researching
a
topic
and
using
the
MLA
style
of
writing.
First
I
was
required
to
do
a
mini
research
paper
on
a
career
of
interest,
Once
that
project
was
completed,
it
was
on
to
the
big
one.
My
research
paper
topic
had
to
be
something
I
knew
nothing
about.
I
chose
to
write
about
phobias.
This
was
not
an
easy
task
because
the
topic
turned
out
to
be
quite
broad.
I
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
doing
research;
my
mom
even
helped
me
use
the
library
at
Kutztown
University
(this
paper
was
serious
business).
Once
I
had
gathered
books,
magazine
articles
and
articles
from
scientific
journals
it
was
time
to
get
to
work.
I
encountered
difficulty
when
I
used
the
scientific
articles.
The
style
that
these
articles
were
written
in
was
completely
foreign
to
me
and
it
took
me
some
time
to
slog
through
them.
Once
again
though,
what
was
a
difficult
task
in
high
school
paid
off
in
college:
I
had
to
write
in
that
scientific
style
for
Biology
101
during
my
first
semester
last
year.
The
actual
writing
of
the
research
paper
was
not
too
difficult.
I
was
already
familiar
with
MLA
and
my
note
cards
helped
me
organize
my
paper
before
I
started
writing
it.
Once
my
first
draft
was
completed,
it
was
peer-edited
and
returned,
I
made
some
significant
revisions
and
was
satisfied
with
my
paper.
I
had
only
one
task
left
to
complete:
I
had
to
write
an
outline
for
my
paper.
I
realize
that
an
outline
should
be
one
of
the
first
steps,
not
the
last
step,
but
outlines
just
aren't
my
style
and
I
couldn't
seem
to
come
up
with
a
thorough
one
before
I
wrote
my
paper.
Oddly
enough,
I
have
never
again
encountered
a
true
outline
requirement
since
writing
my
research
paper,
I
received
an
A
on
my
research
paper
and
was
quite
pleased.
I
believe
Mrs.
Buckendorf
was
impressed
with
my
writing
because
she
thought
there
were
places
in
my
paper
containing
direct
quotes
that
I
did
not
cite
or
put
in
quotation
marks.
That
was
not
the
case,
though.
I
had
written
that
entire
paper
myself
and
whatever
was
a
direct
quotation
was
noted
as
such.
At
any
rate,
my
Research
Paper
class
was
an
extremely
valuable
experience
that
played
a
key
role
in
my
college
preparation.
Another
important
course
in
my
college
preparation
was
the
English
class
I
took
during
my
senior
year
in
high
school.
Advanced
Placement
Literature
and
Composition
(what
I'll
refer
to
as
A.P.
English)
was
my
second
course
with
Mrs.
Buckendorf.
Basically,
A,P.
English
was
the
same
type
of
course
that
English
110
is
at
Lafayette.
Right
from
the
start,
Mrs.
Buckendorf
had
the
class
writing
three
papers
a
week.
Usually,
two
of
the
papers
were
written
on
the
same
piece.
One
was
a
first
draft
and
the
second
was
a
revision,
The
third
paper
was
a
first
draft
on
a
new
piece
with
the
revision
to
be
written
early
in
the
following
week.
The
prospect
of
all
that
writing
seemed
quite
daunting.
The
writing
did
get
somewhat
tedious,
but
looking
back
I
see
the
value
of
it
and
am
able
to
appreciate
the
experience.
A.P.
English
made
me
quite
proficient
at
cranking
out
papers,
which
I
found
beneficial
during
my
first
semester
of
college
when
I
wrote
about
fifteen
papers.
A.P.
English
also
began
to
teach
me
about
developing
a
hypothesis
in
the
beginning
of
a
paper
and
using
accurate
examples
from
the
text
to
reach
a
conclusion
at
the
end.
Until
I
had
A.P.
English,
my
papers'
conclusions
usually
consisted
of
a
recap
of
the
main
points;
there
was
no
so
what
at
the
end,
no
new
insights
or
conclusions
were
reached.
Finally,
A.P.
English
taught
me
how
to
analyze
poetry.
I
learned
a
multitude
of
terms
that
are
used
in
academic
writing
about
poetry,
as
well
as
how
to
decipher
the
metaphors
and
symbolism
many
poets
favor.
Though
I
have
never
found
poetry
easy
to
write
about,
my
experiences
with
it
in
A.P.
English
have
made
the
task
less
difficult,
At
the
end
of
the
school
year
I
took
the
A.P.
Literature
and
Composition
Exam.
It
was
a
challenging
exam.
I
remember
being
asked
to
write
about
two
short
stories
and
two(?)
poems
printed
in
the
exam.
Writing
essays
that
I
could
not
revise
about
works
that
I
had
never
seen
before
or
discussed
in
a
class
was
very
difficult.
However,
I
had
practiced
this
skill
during
A.P.
English
and
that
practice
paid
off.
I
received
a
four
on
the
exam
and
was
able
to
bypass
English
110
at
Lafayette.
After
the
A.P.
Exam
and
final
exams
for
my
classes
were
over,
I
forgot
about
all
things
academic.
I
did
some
summer
reading,
but
that
was
it.
Then
I
arrived
at
Lafayette.
My
first
semester
English
courses
were
real
eye-openers.
I
discovered
that
writing
safe
little
academic
papers
was
no
longer
enough.
My
writing
needed
to
gain
some
teeth
as
one
professor
put
it,
and
gain
teeth
it
did.
One
of
my
first
semester
English
courses,
obviously,
was
an
FYS.
I
was
asked
to
do
many
difficult
readings
throughout
the
course
and
learned
to
think
critically
about
the
rhetoric
of
a
text
and
its
author.
My
FYS
exposed
me
to
a
number
of
different
genres
ranging
from
the
works
of
Aristotle
to
articles
from
the
New
Yorker.
I
studied
advertising,
evangelical
preaching,
and
the
rhetoric
of
political
campaigning.
I
believe
that
what
I
learned
will
always
stick
with
me.
I
am
now
able
to
see
through
advertisements
and
discern
where
their
persuasiveness
lies
and
identify
their
target
audiences.
In
addition,
I
am
able
to
recognize
the
rhetorical
aspects
of
evangelism,
which
preys
on
the
fears
and
insecurities
of
its
followers.
The
effective
false
promises
and
mud-slinging
that
abound
in
politics
are
also
more
evident
to
me.
It
wasn't
just
my
critical
thinking
skills
that
improved,
though.
Once
again,
my
writing
matured
and
it
was
here
that
it
gained
a
few
teeth.
I
really
had
to
think
and
write
critically
and
analytically
as
well
as
devise
insightful
and
thought-provoking
conclusions.
My
other
first
semester
English
course
was
Literary
Form
and
Meaning.
This
was
unlike
any
English
course
I
had
ever
encountered.
It
began
by
emphasizing
narratives,
both
natural
and
literary,
I
understood
what
these
two
narratives
consisted
of
and
could
readily
identify
their
similarities
and
differences.
The
difficulty
I
encountered
was
in
the
text
that
was
used
to
make
the
class
consider
narratives.
We
read
Joseph
Conrad's
Heart
of
Darkness
and
spent
many
class
sessions
discussing
the
work.
Then
it
was
time
to
write
a
paper.
I
think
this
was
my
first
truly
painful
writing
experience.
Despite
all
the
in-class
discussion,
I
had
apparently
missed
the
entire
gist
of
the
work
and
wrote
a
six
page
paper
that
basically
proved
I
had
no
idea
what
I
was
talking
about.
My
professor
told
me
that
he
didn't
even
think
he
could
grade
my
paper
because
I
was
so
far
off
the
mark.
This
was
not
easy
for
me
to
hear
because
I
was
so
used
to
being
told
how
much
talent
I
had
as
a
writer.
This
paper
made
me
question
my
ability,
but
I
was
determined
to
show
the
professor
that
I
could
write
credible
papers,
I
rewrote
my
Heart
of
Darkness
paper
and
finally
hit
the
mark:
Heart
of
Darkness
is
a
narrative
about
narratives,
and
many
can
be
found
throughout
the
work
(I
can't
explain
exactly
what
this
means
here
because
it
would
take
me
four
pages
to
do
it).
I
was
very
happy
when
I
received
a
B
on
my
rewrite,
Though
it
wasn't
the
A
that
I
was
used
to
receiving
on
my
papers,
this
paper
was
something
that
I
worked
extremely
hard
on
and
really
struggled
with--a
B
was
a
winning
grade
for
me.
During
my
second
semester
at
Lafayette,
I
took
Literary
Questions.
This
proved
to
be
another
challenging
course
that
caused
me
to
question
my
writing
abilities,
though
not
to
the
extent
that
Literary
Form
and
Meaning
had.
Literary
Questions
focused
on
writing
effective,
coherent
papers.
I
was
taught
to
use
a
two
paragraph
opening
instead
of
a
one
paragraph
opening.
In
addition,
the
effective
use
of
quotations
and
examples
from
texts
in
arguing
hypotheses
and
reaching
sound
conclusions
was
emphasized.
The
first
paper
I
was
asked
to
write
for
Literary
Questions
was
the
one
that
made
me
question
my
ability
as
a
writer
again.
The
subject
was
Shakespeare's
Sonnets;
the
paper
was
not
so
great.
I
had
a
lot
of
difficulty
writing
about
the
sonnets.
I
understood
them
and
knew
what
I
wanted
to
write
about,
but
for
some
reason
(I'm
still
not
sure
why)
I
just
couldn't
seem
to
get
my
point
across
on
paper.
I
received
a
B
on
the
paper
and
needless
to
say,
I
was
not
surprised.
As
the
semester
went
on
I
was
able
to
utilize
the
new
concepts
I
was
taught
and
improve
drastically
from
my
first
paper.
I
feel
that
my
writing
became
more
polished,
effective,
and
coherent.
I
think
it
even
acquired
a
few
more
teeth,
The
third
paper
I
wrote
for
Literary
Questions
is
one
of
the
best
papers
I
have
written
to
date,
I
received
an
A
on
the
paper,
as
well
as
some
of
the
nicest,
most
encouraging
compliments
I
had
received
in
some
time,
Like
me,
my
professor
felt
that
my
writing
had
come
together
and
was
extremely
coherent
and
persuasive,
Finally
it
seemed
all
my
effort
throughout
my
English
courses
had
been
worthwhile.
I
don't
want
anyone
to
think
that
my
experiences
in
Literary
Questions
or
my
general
success
in
English
courses
have
given
me
a
big
head,
Instead,
what
I
have
come
to
realize
after
each
class
or
course
is
that
there
is
always
room
for
improvement
and
expansion
of
my
writing,
This
paper
certainly
illustrates
that
point.
Looking
ahead,
I
am
confident
that
I
will
continue
to
learn
a
great
deal
and
grow
as
both
an
academic
and
creative
writer
during
my
years
at
Lafayette,
In
fact,
I
already
have
a
suggestion
for
improvement
even
though
the
semester
has
not
yet
begun.
On
my
final
paper
for
Literary
Questions,
my
professor
wrote
that
while
I
have
an
incisive
mind
and
clear
writing
style,
I
sometimes
tend
to
fall
into
a
mechanical
say-what's-expected
mode
that
I
should
try
hard
to
avoid,
The
professor
suggested
that
I
keep
seeking
my
own
voice,
and
I
plan
to
take
his
advice
whole-heartedly,
