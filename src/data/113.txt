In
the
history
of
the
United
States,
certain
Presidents
have
left
such
endearing
marks
on
the
American
culture
that
historians
commonly
use
their
names
to
refer
to
specific
periods
of
American
history.
In
some
way,
Presidential
policies,
personalities,
and
occurrences
often
define
the
culture
of
the
country
at
a
particular
moment.
For
example,
George
Washington's
leadership
and
courage
through
the
birth
of
the
nation
resulted
in
the
Washington
Years
of
the
young
United
States.
Much
later,
the
scandalous
administration
of
Richard
Nixon
during
the
early
1970s
would
lead
to
the
dubious
distinction
of
The
Nixon
years.
And
recently,
the
domination
of
Ronald
Reagan's
administration
throughout
most
of
the
1980s
has
led
to
the
use
of
that
President's
name
in
The
Reagan
Years
.
American
history
is
marked
and
divided
with
the
names
of
these
influential
people.
This
phenomena
occurs
in
other
histories
as
well,
including
my
personal
history
as
a
writer.
It
too
is
marked
and
divided
with
the
names
of
influential
people.
The
influential
names
in
my
history
are
not
President.
In
my
case,
the
names
belong
to
people
who
have
shaped
the
course
of
my
development
as
a
writer.
These
people
have
affected
the
culture
and
heritage
of
my
writing
so
profoundly
that
their
names
are
forever
connected
to
a
specific
period
of
development
in
my
writing
history.
These
names
are
my
Presidents.
They
are
my
landmarks
and
my
timeline,
and
any
writing
narrative
would
be
incomplete
without
the
mention
and
description
of
them.
And
unfortunately,
like
the
Presidents,
some
names
are
remembered
for
better
reasons
than
others.
My
grandma
is
remembered
for
one
of
the
better
reasons.
I
credit
the
teachers
in
my
life
for
the
development
and
growth
of
my
writing
ability.
But
I
credit
my
grandmother
with
planting
the
seed
of
writing
in
the
first
place.
My
grandmother
was
the
first
audience
for
which
I
remember
writing.
I
wrote
a
book
of
poems
for
her
when
I
was
in
sixth
grade.
The
book
was
meant
as
a
gift
for
her
on
her
seventieth
birthday,
and
a
book
of
self-made
poems
bound
in
a
cheap
cover
with
a
crayon
doodle
on
the
front
page
fit
perfectly
into
an
eleven
year
old's
budget.
The
book
contained
some
truly
epic
poems:
Roses
are
red;
violets
are
blue;
grandma
is
great;
and
I
love
you.
At
the
time,
however,
this
book
represented
the
sum
of
my
writing
experience.
And
apparently,
the
simple
rhymes
and
words
spoke
volumes
to
my
grandmother
because
she
talked
about
this
book
for
weeks!
Her
sincere
and
enthusiastic
praise
for
this
simple
piece
of
writing
was
my
first
encouragement
in
the
field
of
writing.
Eventually,
the
book
faded
from
my
memory,
but
I
would
learn
that
it
never
faded
from
my
grandmother's
memory.
Six
year
later,
my
grandmother
passed
away.
My
mother
and
I
travelled
to
the
apartment
to
pack
up
her
personal
belongings.
In
a
box
next
to
my
grandmother's
bed,
I
found
the
book
of
poems.
My
grandmother
had
dated
the
book
inside
the
front
cover,
and,
dogeared
and
tattered,
it
was
showing
signs
of
age.
It
was
a
powerful
moment
because
I
had
completely
forgotten
about
the
poems.
But
apparently
my
grandmother
never
did.
She
always
kept
it
close
by
and
handy.
This
was
my
first
glimpse
into
the
power,
longevity,
and
personal
touch
that
writing
possesses.
Through
her
initial
reaction,
my
grandmother
encouraged
my
writing.
And
then,
through
her
possession
of
the
book
for
so
long,
testified
to
its
staying
power.
In
short,
I
was
deeply
impressed
by
the
power
of
the
written
word,
even
if
the
written
word
was
a
two-bit
book
of
poems.
Yet
alas,
this
idealistic
notion
of
writing
failed
to
lift
my
spirits
for
too
long.
In
grammar
school,
writing
resembled
a
chore
and
a
nuisance.
Grammar
school
was
(and
still
is)
a
hellish
collection
of
writing
memories:
a
2
0-page
report
on
the
glorious
state
of
Texas,
a
ten
page
report
on
the
mysterious
world
of
sharks,
countless
20
point
essays
on
tests,
and
of
course,
book
reports.
Writing
was
not
fun
simply
because
it
was
disguised
as
the
worst
enemy
of
the
all:
homework.
In
the
end,
though,
grammar
school
would
be
where
I
learned
the
most
basic
tools
of
writing:
grammar
itself.
And
it
happened
during
The
Dawson
Years.
I
remember
Mrs.
Dawson,
the
English
teacher
for
the
seventh
and
eight
grades,
as
the
best
grammar
teacher
I
ever
had.
Mrs.
Dawson's
teaching
routine
was
simple
and
direct.
For
weeks,
she
would
make
her
classes
break
down
sentences,
diagram
them,
put
them
back
together
frontwards,
backwards,
and
sometimes
sideways.
She
composed
jingles
to
teach
every
single
preposition
(in
alphabetical
order).
She
would
quiz
the
classes
daily
on
helping
verbs,
proper
nouns,
adverbs,
etc.
At
the
time,
the
lessons
seemed
redundant,
ineffective
and
absolutely
useless
in
our
future
careers.
But
Mrs.
Dawson
would
insist
that
one
day
we
would
use
these
tools
in
our
every
waking
thought.
Eventually,
Mrs.
Dawson
words
rang
true.
I
remember
my
first
day
in
a
high
school
english
class
as
a
tribute
to
Mrs.
Dawson.
My
teacher,
Mrs.
Reynolds,
was
trying
to
get
a
feel
for
the
knowledge
of
the
class,
and
was
quizzing
random
students
on
simple
English
vocabulary
and
grammar.
And
although
she
never
called
on
me,
I
correctly
answered
every
question
myself
while
other
students
stammered,
guessed
and
flopped
under
her
ceaseless
inquisition.
When
I
asked
my
fellow
graduates
of
The
Dawson
Years
if
they
experienced
the
same
thing,
they
all
nodded
their
heads
in
amazement.
Wow,
I
thought,
that
stuff
really
did
work.
Mrs.
Dawson
gave
me
the
most
basic
tools
for
my
writing
future:
sound
mechanics
and
an
appreciation
of
the
English
language.
But
still,
I
would
not
realize
their
full
potential
until
later
in
high
school.
I
began
to
truly
appreciate
writing
as
an
art
during
my
sophomore
year
in
high
school.
My
English
teacher,
one
Mr.
Edward
G.
Healy
(who
I
despise
to
this
day),
taught
only
one
lesson
that
really
affected
me.
In
fact,
this
one
lesson
may
be
the
only
thing
I
ever
liked
about
this
man.
On
the
blackboard,
he
drew
a
pyramid
and
divided
it
into
three
uneven
levels.
In
the
broadest
level
at
the
bottom,
he
wrote
the
word
Thoughts
.
In
the
second,
slightly
smaller
level,
he
wrote
Speech
.
And
at
the
peak
of
the
pyramid,
he
squeezed
the
word
Writing
into
the
cramped
space.
Mr.
Healy
then
turned
to
the
class
and
said
Each
ability
represents
the
level(s)
below.
This,
therefore,
is
the
challenge
of
writing:
to
represent
your
entire
essence
in
the
concise,
compact
written
word.
This
is
why
the
ability
to
write
is
crucial.
At
that
moment,
I
realized
that
I
did
not
want
my
essence
to
be
represented
by
anything
less
then
my
best
effort.
Up
to
that
point,
my
essence
was
......
lacking.
And
although
I
was
never
further
motivated
by
Mr.
Healy,
this
one
lesson
was
an
eye-opening
experience.
The
realizations
during
the
Healy
Year
helped
me
in
my
next
significant
writing
experience.
This
experience
came
only
two
years
later
during
an
AP
English
course.
The
final
paper
for
the
class
loomed
as
a
15-20
page
paper
on
a
novel
or
novels
of
our
own
choosing.
At
the
time,
the
strange,
new
freedom
in
topics
caused
both
excitement
and
fear.
There
was
no
particular
avenue
that
I
wanted
to
explore
enough
to
produce
an
interesting
paper,
although
the
oddity
of
Albert
Camus's
The
Stranger
stood
out
to
me.
But
there
seemed
nothing
about
the
work
alone
that
could
stir
me
to
15-20
pages
of
thoughtful
insights.
My
teacher,
the
wonderful
Ms.
Krumm
(who
to
this
day
I
still
admire)
,
proposed
comparing
The
Stranger
with
another
novel,
perhaps
outside
the
mainstream.
I
researched
a
little,
and
found
the
dark
novel
A
CLockwork
Orange
by
Anthony
Burgess.
In
these
two
novels,
I
found
a
distinctly
challenging
and
intriguing
parallel
to
exploit:
crime
and
punishment
in
society.
This
theme
could
have
given
me
50
pages
of
ideas,
but
I
painstakingly
narrowed
it
down
to
a
precise
thesis.
After
Ms.
Krumm
reviewed
the
final
draft,
she
pulled
me
aside
and
complimented
both
my
unusual
selection
of
works
and
the
resulting
paper.
Instead
of
taking
the
compliments
as
separate
and
distinct,
I
realized
that
the
two
compliments
were
actually
related:
I
excelled
the
most
when
I
challenged
myself
in
the
most
unusual
way.
This
eye-opening
realization
would
become
one
of
the
most
important
principles
in
my
writing
history.
I
vowed
always
to
choose
the
road
less
taken
in
my
writing
process.
My
reliance
on
this
principle,
however,
would
be
sorely
tested
during
my
First
Year
Seminar
at
Lafayette.
By
some
quirk
in
the
cosmos,
I
was
placed
in
an
engineer's
seminar
of
which
I
had
absolutely
no
interest.
As
a
future
government/law
major,
I
was
not
thrilled
to
be
placed
in
a
environmental
engineering
seminar,
where
the
class
would
discuss
various
methods
to
treat
waste
and
protect
the
environment.
Out
of
the
15
people
in
the
class,
yours
truly
was
the
only
nonengineer.
With
one
look
at
the
syllabus
and
textbook,
I
realized
that
I
would
have
no
interest
in
the
course
material.
But
rather
than
undertake
the
arduous
task
of
transferring,
I
decided
to
sit
still
and
suffer
in
silence.
In
the
end,
this
decision
stands
out
as
the
turning
point
of
my
writing
career
at
college.
Writing
in
this
course
would
be
unlike
anything
I
had
done
before.
The
course
material
allowed
little
freedom
to
explore
personal
histories
or
exploit
personal
biases.
The
writing
was
mainly
research
and
reports.
It
quickly
became
difficult
to
challenge
myself
to
write
an
interesting
paper.
The
writing,
however,
did
force
me
to
clearly
and
articulately
explain
distant
and
unknown
topics.
I
was
forced
to
deal
with
incredible
amounts
of
technical
information
in
short
concise
papers.
This
seminar
refined
the
technicalities
of
my
writing,
including
sentence
structure,
organization
and
(the
always
entertaining)
bibliographies.
I
learned
that
although
the
writing
topic
may
not
interest
me,
I
could
still
write
effective
(if
not
passionate)
papers
on
almost
any
material.
This
lesson
would
prove
invaluable
in
the
remaining
college
courses.
In
an
ideal
world,
a
writer
would
be
passionately
involved
in
any
paper
topic.
But
this
is
most
definitely
NOT
an
ideal
world,
and
a
writer
still
needs
to
write
effectively
about
any
subject.
This
seminar,
combined
with
AP
English
during
my
senior
year,
taught
me
to
write
effectively
on
both
spectrums
of
topics:
personally
interesting,
and
mundanely
boring.
This
most
recent
lessons
takes
me
to
the
present.
While
I
have
tried
to
point
out
the
major
players
and
events
in
my
literary
narrative,
it
is
impossible
to
be
completely
thorough.
Because
of
the
condition
of
anonymity
at
Lafayette
alone,
I
am
leaving
out
several
important
people.
But
it
is
difficult
to
be
thorough
for
other
reasons
as
well.
Like
the
history
of
the
United
States
of
America,
my
history
as
a
writer
is
ever
changing
and
evolving.
History
does
not
end.
New
events
will
reflect
back
onto
my
history
as
it
is.
I
am
curious
about
the
effects
of
being
a
writing
associate
on
my
writing.
I
am
curious
about
the
effects
of
graduation
and
future
careers
on
my
writing.
But
my
history
will
continue
to
be
demarcated
by
the
names
and
faces
of
the
people
who
shape
my
writing
ability.
Some
names,
of
course,
will
be
remembered
for
better
reasons
than
others.
Some
things
never
change.
