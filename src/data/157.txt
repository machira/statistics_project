Literacy
Narrative
Mom!
I
whined.
I
can't
keep
Chissy
from
coming
in
my
room.
How
can
I
make
her
stop
barging
in?
My
busy
mother
hurriedly
suggested
that
I
put
a
sign
on
my
door
that
said,
Do
Not
Come
In.
Being
as
I
was
barely
four
years
old,
the
finished
product
of
efforts
to
keep
my
sister
out
of
my
room
was
a
piece
of
scrap
paper
that
said,
simply
ON!
I
was
trying
to
write
NO!
because
writing
out
the
whole
sentence
seemed
impossible
at
the
time.
My
sister
laughed
at
me
but
it
stopped
her
from
coming
into
my
room
and
the
first
seeds
of
my
interest
in
writing
had
been
planted.
That
experience
was
my
first
cue
that
writing
could
be
used
a
form
of
communication.
When
I
entered
kindergarten,
we
had
to
draw
a
picture
of
a
ladybug
and
write
This
insect
is
black
and
red.
I
had
no
problem
drawing
the
bug
but
I
could
seem
to
write
the
sentence.
I
couldn't
write
in
lowercase
and
my
letters
were
huge,
sloppy,
and
uneven.
My
writing
grew
worse
and
worse.
Everytime
we
had
to
do
the
writing
sample
about
the
quick
fox
and
the
clever
jackal,
I
would
be
the
student
who
had
to
keep
writing
it
over
and
over
again.
By
third
grade,
my
mother
was
writing
everything
out
for
me
and
I
had
to
copy
her
writing
as
best
as
I
could.
It
was
a
major
drag
for
both
of
us.
Some
teachers
even
let
me
write
in
pen
in
hopes
that
they
would
be
able
to
read
my
handwriting.
It
didn't
help
very
much.
In
the
summer
after
third
grade,
two
things
happened
that
changed
my
writing
for
the
better.
I
started
reading
incessantly
and
I
acquired
a
pen
pal.
Reading
a
lot
of
books
spurred
my
imagination
to
write
my
own
stories
and
having
a
pen
pal
encouraged
me
to
write
neatly.
When
I
could
write
with
ease,
the
ideas
in
my
head
flowed
a
lot
more
easily
onto
paper.
My
fourth
grade
teacher
was
very
impressed
that
I
was
no
longer
writing
chicken
scratch
and
that
I
actually
enjoyed
the
creative
process
of
writing.
Fourth
grade
was
the
first
year
that
I
entered
a
poetry
contest.
We
had
to
write
a
poem
about
our
love
of
trees
for
Arbor
Day
and
I
put
my
heart
into
it.
I
lost
to
Marie
Murray,
the
girl
who
won
everything
but
my
interest
in
poetry
remained.
During
this
same
time,
I
began
to
keep
a
diary.
I
would
write
in
my
diary
in
pencil
and
it's
embarrassing
to
admit
that
the
hot
topics
included
in
my
diary
included
boys
I
liked
or
whined
about
a
fight
I
may
have
had
with
one
of
my
siblings.
This
was
also
the
year
that
I
had
to
write
my
first
serious
report
about
an
Explorer.
I
had
to
write
about
Cortez,
the
man
who
conquered
Mexico.
Even
in
1986,
these
reports
did
not
have
to
be
typed.
Rather,
just
written
very
neatly.
In
fifth
grade,
I
had
a
wonderful
teacher
named
Mrs.
Johnson
who
would
put
a
sentence
on
the
blackboard
and
asked
us
to
write
a
story
based
around
it.
I
enjoyed
this
exercise
very
much.
I
would
come
up
with
very
interesting
stories
and
my
teacher
would
praise
me
for
them.
During
this
year
in
my
schooling,
we
had
to
write
state
reports.
My
state
was
Hawaii
and
it
was
a
big
deal
because
the
reports
had
to
be
typed.
Very
few
fifth
graders
could
type
at
this
time
so
most
of
us
handed
these
reports
out
to
be
typed
by
our
mothers.
I
was
still
keeping
a
diary
but
I
had
stopped
confessing
about
boys
and
different
annoyances.
I
was
now
writing
my
feelings
and
opinions
of
most
things
that
I
was
too
shy
to
discuss
out
loud.
When
I
hit
sixth
grade,
it
was
an
explosion
of
writing.
I
was
now
in
Middle
school
and
I
was
writing
in
almost
every
class.
I
really
enjoyed
it.
In
my
Gifted
and
Talented
reading
class,
I
had
to
keep
a
weekly
journal
to
be
handed
in
to
my
teacher.
I
loved
writing
in
it
and
I
would
often
write
pages
more
than
the
three
entries
that
we
were
required
to
write.
I
also
had
a
wonderful
Language
Arts
teacher
who
would
write
something
different
on
the
board
each
day
in
class
and
we
would
have
to
write
a
paragraph
on
it.
I
was
still
keeping
a
private
diary
outside
of
school
but
now
I
called
it
a
journal
and
I
wrote
about
my
take
and
humor
on
daily
occurrences.
I
liked
to
write
funny
pieces
that
made
people
laugh
and
I
could
find
humor
in
almost
any
situation.
In
seventh
grade,
I
started
writing
for
my
school
newspaper.
I
wasn't
very
good
at
serious
pieces
but
I
really
excelled
at
humorous
pieces.
My
teachers
would
repeatedly
tell
me
that
I
was
gifted
but
I
didn't
believe
them.
I
thought
that
they
were
being
cheesy.
If
I
was
so
gifted
than
my
poems
wouldn't
keep
on
being
rejected
form
the
different
magazines
I
was
sending
them
to.
Writing
was
a
lot
of
fun
for
me
that
year.
I
would
write
different
limericks
for
my
friends
and
I
even
entered
some
work
in
a
poetry
contest.
I
was
responsible
for
more
and
more
serious
research
papers,
and
although
the
research
was
a
drag,
the
writing
component
of
the
paper
was
always
very
enjoyable
to
me.
In
eighth
grade,
my
journal
consisted
of
'many
entries
talking
heatedly
about
the
Persian
Gulf
War.
I
began
to
write
seriously
(as
serious
as
an
eighth
grade
writer
can
be)
pieces
about
our
involvement
in
the
war
and
how
wrong
I
perceived
it
to
be.
My
Math
classes
got
harder
while
my
Language,
English,
and
Writing
classes
grew
simpler.
I
couldn't
wait
to
get
to
high
school
where
I
would
be
challenged.
I
took
my
first
Creative
Writing
class
when
I
was
a
freshman.
It
was
on
of
the
best
experiences
of
my
life.
I
learned
to
write
sonnets,
short
stories,
found
poems,
and
essays.
This
class
helped
my
write
papers
in
my
English
classes
because
I
had
a
broader
understanding
of
writing.
My
teacher
would
write,
You've
got
the
gift!
on
my
papers.
However,
not
all
of
my
high
school
teachers
believed
I
was
as
gifted
as
all
that.
History
teachers
would
praise
my
writing
style
while
condemning
the
lack
of
meat
in
my
work.
My
research
papers
fell
below
the
A
line
because
they
were
simply
not
as
thorough
as
they
could
have
been.
A
few
years
into
high
school
I
got
the
guts
to
give
some
of
my
work
to
the
literary
magazine
called
Viewpoint
.
Almost
all
of
my
humorous
poems
were
deemed
fit
for
publication.
Each
work
was
discussed
by
the
Viewpoint
staff
and
the
contributors
were
allowed
to
sit
in
on
the
meeting.
I
heard
my
funny
poems
praised.
One
time
I
decided
to
enter
a
serious
work.
It
did
not
get
the
same
reception.
It
was
made
fun
of
horribly
and
it
was
very
painful
to
listen
to.
However,
I
can
see
now
that
is
wasn't
a
very
good
poem
and
I
can
even
laugh
at
it
myself.
I
had
tried
to
make
the
whole
poem
rhyme
and
it
had
become
the
definition
of
cliche,
what
with
flowers
blooming
and
darkness
falling.
It
was
really
quite
terrible
but
I
didn't
think
so
at
the
time.
At
this
same
time,
I
was
sending
out
a
monthly
newsletter
to
the
members
of
my
church
and
I
had
even
snagged
an
internship
at
out
local
paper.
I
was
reviewing
movies
and
books
and
television
shows
as
a
young
reviewer
and
I
loved
it.
My
writing
was
never
critiqued
by
the
staff
at
the
press,
which
I
would
have
liked,
but
they
just
printed
whatever
the
young
reviews
wrote.
It
was
a
great
leaning
experience,
though,
because
I
had
never
reviewed
film
and
books
before
if
you
don't
count
the
occasional
book
report.
My
senior
year
of
high
school,
I
had
to
write
a
senior
thesis
about
poet
Edna
St.
Vincent
Millay.
It
was
very
grueling
work
and
I
kept
on
revising
it
and
then
revising
it
again.
I
did
not
feel
confident
with
what
I
wrote
so
I
was
nervous
when
I
handed
it
in.
I
got
an
A
on
the
thesis
and
I
felt
relieved
that
I
had
revised
it
so
many
times.
By
now
technology
was
advanced
to
the
point
where
I
was
using
WordPerfect
to
write
all
of
my
papers.
I
even
wrote
my
college
admission
essays
on
WordPerfect
and
I
thought
that
most
of
the
essays
were
very
easy.
While
most
of
my
friends
stressed
about
them,
I
enjoyed
writing
about
my
most
courageous
moment
or
the
most
difficult
challenge
I
had
faced.
All
through
high
school
I
had
been
continuing
with
my
creative
writing.
It
was
mostly
poetry
but
some
short
stories.
I
was
also
writing
in
my
journal
faithfully
and
I
was
glad
that
I
did
in
hindsight.
It
really
gives
me
an
idea
about
my
development
at
that
point.
I
also
think
it
improved
my
academic
writing
over
time.
When
I
arrived
at
Lafayette,
my
writing
training
was
more
than
adequate.
I
had
trouble
with
my
Math
and
Sciences
courses
but
I
never
had
any
trouble
utilizing
writing
for
my
courses.
I
would
stress
out
a
lot
for
a
test
but
when
I
had
a
paper
due
I
felt
no
fear
that
it
would
come
out
poorly.
I
took
an
Advanced
Writing
class
my
sophomore
year
and
that
really
challenged
me
a
lot.
I
was
with
a
tough
professor
and
some
truly
great
writers
and
for
once
I
wasn't
top
banana.
When
I
read
the
papers
of
others,
I
could
understand
why
my
writing
was
in
need
of
improvement.
This
was
my
darkest
time
as
a
writer
because
I
felt
so
inferior
to
the
other
writers
in
the
class
but
it
was
also
the
time
that
I
learned
the
most
about
what
it
takes
to
be
a
good
writer.
Talent
only
gets
you
so
far.
You
have
to
work
to
perfect
your
art.
During
this
time
I
was
correcting
and
editing
papers
upon
my
friends'
requests.
I
enjoyed
doing
it
and
enjoyed
the
relief
they
felt
after
I
had
looked
over
their
paper.
I
was
also
active
on
the
writing
circuit
at
Lafayette,
if
such
a
thing
exists.
I
had
works
published
in
The
Toilet
Paper,
The
Marquis,
and
The
Blunt.
I
had
also
won
an
honorable
mention
in
the
Jean
Corrie
poetry
contest.
Even
though
I
was
writing
creatively,
the
practice
helped
my
academic
writing
and
my
grades
got
even
better.
