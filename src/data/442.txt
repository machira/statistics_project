WA
Essay
2004
My
neighbors
last
year
must
have
thought
I
was
insane.
For
about
a
week
during
the
first
semester,
for
intermittent
periods
of
thirty
to
forty-five
minutes,
they
surely
heard
through
the
paper-thin
dorm
wall
the
persistent
sounds
of
rapid
gunfire
and
increasing
mania,
originating
in
my
room.
Over
and
over
these
sounds
burst
forth,
undoubtedly
audible
not
only
next
door
but
down
the
hallway.
And
if
they
realized
D
which
I
am
certain
they
eventually
did
D
that
these
sounds
were
not
originating
from
real
artillery,
but
rather
from
my
television,
their
assessment
of
my
mental
state,
in
all
likelihood,
probably
did
not
change.
After
all,
watching
the
same
gun
ridden,
forty-second
clip
of
Taxi
Driver
character
Travis
BickleOs
growing
derangement
would
only
be
the
activity
of
someone
similarly
deranged.
The
only
defense
I
have
to
such
assumptions
is
that
I
was
writing
a
paper
on
the
film,
critically
studying
that
particular
forty-second
segment.
As
a
writer,
what
else
could
I
do
but
use
the
loop
function
on
my
DVD
player
and
repeatedly
view
the
scene?
From
my
point
of
view,
nothing
else
would
have
worked.
In
the
past
year,
as
a
Writing
Associate
and
as
a
writer
myself,
I
came
to
the
intuitive
D
and
in
retrospect,
somewhat
obvious
D
realization
that
good
writing
involves
submersion
of
some
kind.
Be
it
intuitive
or
learned,
I
found
that
my
best
writing
and
my
best
WA
conferencing
was
the
result
of
applying
the
concept
of
submersion.
The
idea
of
delving
into
a
project
through
submersion
can
seem
strict
and
bookish,
however
in
many
ways,
it
can
be
simplifying
and
freeing.
The
trick
to
and
the
success
of
submersion
stems
from
its
one
hard-and-fast
characteristic:
that
it
is
not
hard-and-fast.
Essentially,
it
is
not
a
rule
like
Oi
before
e
except
after
c,O
where
in
all
cases
its
application
is
assured;
instead,
it
is
a
habit
and
the
only
way
to
assure
its
success
is
to
respect
it
and
simply,
to
follow
it.
Thus,
in
each
setting
or
circumstance,
with
the
proper
attitude,
I
found
that
the
most
personally
intuitive
and
custom
solution
will
result,
making
the
writing
process
simpler
and
more
enjoyable.
For
example,
in
my
case,
I
was
writing
my
film
paper,
and
logically,
I
viewed
the
film.
But
I
knew
that
was,
of
course,
not
enough
to
produce
a
successful
paper.
So,
I
submerged
myself.
First,
I
watched
the
film,
notebook
in
hand.
Throughout
this
viewing
I
took
notes,
even
though
my
paper
was
only
on
one
particular,
short
segment
in
the
middle
of
the
film.
Eventually,
through
other
film
papers,
I
would
learn
that
these
preliminary
notes
rarely
made
a
direct
contribution
to
my
paper.
Nevertheless,
I
took
them
and
continued
to
take
them,
as
they
were
useful
in
more
indirect
ways.
Having
watched
the
film,
I
had
a
context.
I
then
set
the
notes
aside
and
looked
at
them
a
day
or
so
later.
I
viewed
and
reviewed
my
scene,
from
all
different
cinematic
aspects.
At
some
moments,
my
notes
flowed
freely,
so
much
so
that
I
even,
at
times,
had
to
pause
in
order
to
get
all
of
my
flash
insight
onto
the
page.
There
were
later
times
when
I
would
stare
in
a
kind
of
blank,
but
intense
focus
at
passing
images
or
at
one
particularly
striking
but
interpretively-elusive
still
image.
Nevertheless,
this
kind
of
activity
begat
my
notes,
which
many
times,
flowed
into
kinds
of
on-the-spot
paragraphs.
Approximately
two-thirds
of
this
paper
and
similar
papers
were,
in
essence,
written
on
my
notebook
in
front
of
the
television.
I
am
certain
that
I
would
never
have
produced
a
similar
result
had
I
attempted
to
write
in
the
formal
and
conventional
manner,
sitting
at
my
computer,
facing
a
blank
screen.
What
I
needed
was
submersion:
not
a
blank
screen
but
a
screen
that
continually
flashed
the
cinematically
rich
images
of
my
source
material.
I
applied
the
same
concept
to
my
other
papers
involving
film.
The
weekly
papers,
for
example,
were
due
each
Monday
in
class.
However,
because
the
professor
began
accepting
them
as
early
as
the
Thursday
beforehand,
and
because
we
viewed
the
films
on
Wednesday
nights,
I
would
often
leave
the
screening
and
immediately
go
back
to
my
room
to
write
my
response.
These
papers,
although
they
were
intended
to
be
reasonably
quick
responses,
ended
up
having
a
concise
depth
and
insight
that
I
believe
would
have
been
difficult
to
match,
even
with
repeated
viewings
of
the
film.
My
submersion
in
this
case
involved
not
repetition,
but
an
intensity
of
the
project.
The
note-taking
during
the
film
screening
and
the
writing
that
followed
was
characterized,
for
me,
by
a
single-mindedness
of
my
purpose,
which
introduced
in
me
a
constant
and
conscious
active
analysis.
Although
I
am
usually
fairly
analytical,
this
mindset
occurred
in
a
greater
degree.
It
almost
seemed,
thanks
to
the
time
constraint,
that
I
was
mindfully
building
my
paper,
concurrent
to
my
note-taking;
I
would
leave
the
theater
not
overwhelmed,
but
rather
with
a
paper
already
in
my
head
D
one
which
needed
only
to
be
boiled
down
and
put
onto
paper.
Many
of
my
papers
from
last
year
needed
for
me
just
to
Oput
it
on
paper.O
This
meant
that,
in
one
way
or
another,
I
had
already
done
what
I
saw
as
the
difficult
part
D
the
formulating
of
the
paperOs
essence
D
and
all
I
had
to
do
then
was
to
put
it
on
paper,
or
rather,
the
computer
screen.
This
could
mean
that
I
had
taken
copious
notes
and
basically
had
to
transcribe
them,
filling
in
bits
here
and
there;
this
could
also
mean
that
I
had
taken
some
notes
but
had
strong
source
material
highlighted,
labeled,
and
cross-referenced
from
one
page,
packet,
or
book
to
another,
and
I
just
had
to
interpret
from
the
notes
to
the
screen.
For
me,
the
process
became
organic,
the
paper
evolving
and
slowly
appearing,
like
the
generalized
to
specific
development
of
gray
tones
on
a
photograph
in
a
chemical
bath.
In
some
ways,
having
the
paper
Owritten
before
it
was
writtenO
was
wonderful,
and
in
other
ways,
it
was
quite
difficult.
Regardless,
I
am
sure
that
the
success
of
these
methods
was
a
result
of
my
pre-established
confidence
in
my
content
before
I
was
faced
with
the
task
of
putting
all
the
words
together.
In
a
way,
through
this
process,
writing
separated
itself
into
two
component
parts:
content
and
construction.
Either
I
realized
this
and
it
made
me
a
better
WA,
or
being
a
WA
made
me
realize
this.
It
was
probably
a
little
bit
of
both.
My
style
and
attitudes
towards
writing
often
naturally
falls
into
this
interlocked
nature
of
these
two
components.
This,
in
addition
to
my
single-minded
natural
tendency
to
obsess,
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
I
feel
confident
as
a
writer.
While
working
on
particularly
difficult
or
daunting
assignments,
such
as
my
film
paper
or
an
English
paper
on
metaphysical
poetry,
my
mind
considered
the
two
writing
aspects
of
content
and
construction
and
I
become
submerged
in
them.
As
a
result,
my
social
conversation
often
left
references
to
either
my
film,
VAST,
or
English
papers.
My
writing
submersion
has
been
clear
to
me
in
my
D
often
irritating
D
single-minded
clinging
to
whatever
paper
was
currently
at
hand.
However,
as
I
mentioned
before,
this
comes
natural
to
me
but
not
necessarily
to
others.
As
it
is
an
important
part
of
my
writing
process,
I
instinctively
applied
this
attitude
to
my
WA
conferences;
through
these
half-hour
meetings,
I
came
to
the
understanding
of
what
comprises
the
ingredients
in
my
writing
process:
the
elements
of
content,
construction,
and
submersion.
Taken
in
a
general
sense,
these
elements
seem
rather
straightforward.
Nevertheless,
my
realization
of
my
own
writing
methods
greatly
helped
me
to
assist
WA
students
in
their
writing.
This
really
was
a
crucial
step
in
my
conferencing,
as
I
could
always
step
back
and
look
at
their
drafts
from
these
points
of
view.
Regardless
of
whether
their
drafts
were
either
well-written
or
not-so-well-written,
applying
each
respective
area
to
each
student
paper
usually
revealed
not
only
the
appropriate
areas
to
remedy
but
the
remedy
itself.
For
example,
a
common
tendency
among
the
writers
in
my
FYS
was
to
strictly
adhere
to
content,
manifested
in
its
most
literal
sense,
as
a
list
of
facts
organized
into
sentences.
In
these
cases,
construction
presented
itself
in
its
most
minimum
form,
as
a
basic
point-to-point
structure.
In
order
to
add
coherence
to
their
papers,
I
urged
writers
to
submerge
their
selves
not
only
in
the
content
D
which
was
often
reasonably
well
established
D
but
also
in
the
construction,
by
applying
and
including
thoughtful
analysis.
Although
I
always
tried
to
focus
on
strong
analysis
in
many
of
my
papers,
I
gained
a
greater
consciousness
of
it
from
being
a
WA.
I
would
claim,
even,
that
my
analytical
abilities
improved
somewhat,
if
only
slightly,
from
actively
working
with
each
student
to
find
possible
solutions.
For
the
most
part,
I
believe
that
my
writing,
in
conjunction
with
my
WA
work,
brought
about
this
new
awareness
of
the
dynamics
of
a
paper.
This
was
something
I
attempted
to
convey
to
the
WA
students,
because
with
an
awareness
of
what
a
paper
really
is,
I
believe
a
student
can
only
fail
through
lack
of
capability
or
lack
of
effort.
Any
student
who
truly
understands
what
makes
a
paper
work,
who
puts
the
necessary
effort
into
making
it
work,
will
make
it
work.
An
example
of
how
this
applied
often
involved
the
length
requirement
of
the
paper
drafts.
For
obvious
reasons,
students
often
included
material
that
was,
although
related
somewhat
to
the
subject
matter,
extraneous.
Usually
they
would
recognize
its
irrelevance
when
they
realized
that
they
could
not
explain
its
purpose
in
the
paper.
Again,
the
role
of
analysis
made
itself
apparent
to
me.
If
proper
analysis
is
applied,
nothing
irrelevant
can
begin
to
justify
its
existence
in
a
paper.
I
became
conscious
of
this
myself,
during
both
the
first
and
second
semester.
For
my
final
film
project
at
the
end
of
the
first
semester,
I
had
a
paper
which,
despite
my
best
efforts,
continued
to
grow
on
my
outline.
Normally,
I
would
have
been
thrilled
to
have
content
filling
up
the
page
so
easily,
but
in
this
case
I
really
respected
the
paper,
and
I
wanted
the
best
possible
end
result.
Although
I
was
allowed
to
exceed
the
page
limit
and
did
in
the
end,
I
forced
myself
to
excise
a
number
of
smaller
but
reasonably
worthy
points.
I
did
this
for
two
reasons.
One,
because
of
time
constraints,
I
would
have
had
to
spread
my
attention
from
detailed
focus
on
the
most
significant
main
points
to
a
lesser
focus
on
all
of
the
points.
Second,
and
more
significantly,
I
came
to
the
conclusion
that
extraneous
material
can
refer
not
only
to
a
point
that
is
outside
the
realm
of
the
paper,
but
that
it
is
also
outside
of
the
necessary
realm.
I
realized
that
the
paper
would
be
more
powerful,
concise,
and
intact
without
the
concluding
trail
of
smaller
Ohey-I-noticed-this-tooO
points.
Then
in
the
second
semester,
in
several
projects,
I
came
upon
a
situation
in
which
I
had
a
good
quote,
point,
or
fact
from
my
source
material.
However,
in
my
attempts
to
apply
analysis,
I
was
forced
to
resign
its
use
from
my
paper.
Either
it
was
insightful
or
interesting
on
its
own
but
without
an
organic
place
in
my
paper,
or
it
would
have
had
an
organic
place
had
I
gone
to
the
trouble
to
introduce
a
side
point,
build
a
paragraph
around
the
quote,
use
the
quote,
and
then
bring
the
subject
back
again.
But
that
would
have
been
artificially
organic.
In
the
end,
I
recognized
what
I
would
have
heard
had
I
gone
to
a
WA
appointment
with
myself
as
the
WA.
I
think
this
is
one
of
the
more
notable
effects
of
being
a
WA:
when
you
write,
you
remain
in
a
permanent
conference.
Thanks
to
this
mentality,
in
my
second
VAST
paper,
I
became
concerned
about
the
confusion
that
my
abstract
content
would
cause.
I
was
discussing
what,
in
my
opinion,
it
means
to
be
a
human
being.
Because
the
term
OhumanO
encompasses
so
many
meanings
and
because
my
explanation
encompassed
so
many
levels,
I
wondered
how
I
might
clarify
my
concepts
to
the
reader.
And
partially
from
myself
and
partially
from
what
I
imagined
I
would
have
told
a
student
in
my
case,
I
developed
a
specialized
vocabulary
for
my
paper,
making
several
distinctions
between
different
kinds
of
Ohumans.O
These
definitions,
though
intended
to
help
the
reader
or
the
WA,
also
helped
me
understand
what
I
was
trying
to
explain.
The
VAST
course
offered
extremely
abstract
topics
for
its
papers
and
thankfully,
it
came
with
a
WA.
In
the
VAST
papersO
cases,
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
conference
with
a
WA
other
than
myself,
because
of
the
sheer
confusion
the
papers
could
create.
As
a
writer,
once
I
finally
clarified
the
content
of
the
paper
in
my
head,
I
could
hardly
put
myself
at
a
distance.
Working
with
another
WA
helped
quite
a
bit,
and
her
understanding
of
the
definitions
I
had
used
was
a
reassuring
foundation
on
which
I
built
my
revisions.
In
the
past
year,
I
know
I
have
learned
a
lot
about
writing.
Being
a
WA,
I
had
a
natural
inclination
to
understanding
what
did
and
did
not
work
in
writing.
However,
in
articulating
what
had
usually
been
instinct,
I
found
a
forum
for
learning
on
both
sides:
that
of
the
WA
student
and
that
of
the
WA
myself.
Day
to
day,
being
interested
in
detail
and
prone
to
overanalyzing
predisposes
me
to
many
of
writings
expectations,
I
suppose.
But
it
is
my
opinion
that
submersion
really
makes
or
breaks
the
writer,
and
it
does
not
need
to
exist
instinctively.
As
writers,
we
have
to
breed
interest
in
the
subjects
about
which
we
are
writing.
Without
the
writerOs
interest,
a
readerOs
interest
is
more
than
likely
going
to
be
nonexistent.
This
is
why,
in
the
past
year,
my
most
successful
papers
were
ones
where
I
wrote
about
something
in
which
I
was
interested.
It
was
more
than
that,
though.
I
enjoyed
them
because
I
was
enabled,
through
the
assignments,
to
write
about
something
that
was
of
interest
to
me;
more
importantly,
however,
through
the
writing,
I
was
able
to
understand
something
that
was
of
interest
to
me.
I
now
realize
D
thanks
to
my
WA
experiences
D
that
I
stress
analysis
in
WA
conferences
and
in
myself
not
because
it
is
a
text-book
requisite
of
writing,
but
rather,
because
its
capacity
for
comprehension,
articulation,
and
conversation
is,
as
I
see
it,
writing.
This
year
has
been
a
successful
year
for
me,
because
with
a
greater
understanding
about
my
writing,
in
addition
to
writing
in
general,
the
creation-revision
process
becomes
clearer
and
more
enjoyable.
