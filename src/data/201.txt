Writing
Associate
Program
Summer
Assignment
Date

August

1999
My
attitude
towards
writing
and
my
ability
to
write
has
changed
continuously
throughout
my
history
as
a
writer.
I
believe
the
individuals
who
instructed
me
have
influenced
my
attitude
most
strongly.
However,
I
also
believe
my
writing
has
been
influenced
by
my
enjoyment
and
understanding
of
the
subjects
of
which
I
am
writing.
My
earliest
memories
of
writing
consist
of
composing
sentences
using
my
weekly
spelling
words.
I
remember
my
excitement
when
I
composed
a
sentence
that
utilized
more
then
one
spelling
word
or
a
sentence
whose
length
exceeded
the
line
of
theme
paper.
Since
these
sentences
were
more
difficult
to
create,
these
were
the
ones
by
which
the
teacher
would
write
"very
good"
or
"nice."
Another
vivid
memory
of
mine
includes
my
monthly
fourth
grade
book
reports
as
well
as
my
quarterly
research
papers
of
two
written
pages.
I
still
remember
how
long
two
written
pages
seemed
as
well
as
the
topic
of
my
first
paper,
the
Iroquois
Indians.
Most
of
my
writing
prior
to
sixth
grade
was
created
using
a
pen
or
pencil.
However,
at
this
time,
I
was
introduced
to
the
importance
of
presentation.
One
of
my
teacher's
favorite
assignments
was
for
the
students
to
create
products.
We
would
then
compose
a
script
and
finally
market
our
product
to
the
class
as
a
live
presentation.
These
presentations,
complete
with
music,
choreography,
and
props,
became
known
as
our
commercials.
These
commercials
stand
out
along
my
history
as
a
writer
as
well
as
along
my
journey
of
developing
my
creativity,
public
speaking,
and
confidence.
Another
major
development
occurred
in
seventh
grade
when
I
conducted
my
first,
of
many,
science
fair
projects.
This
experience
constitutes
a
milestone
in
my
writing
history
for
several
reasons.
The
most
notable
reason
would
be
that
it
was
the
first
technical,
most
specifically
scientific,
writing
that
I
was
required
to
do.
The
first
challenge
that
I
faced
lied
in
adjusting
to
focusing
more
on
communicating
my
message
clearly
rather
then
eloquently.
Another
variation
that
I
encountered
as
a
result
of
my
first
science
fair
project
sprouted
from
the
difference
in
length.
Because
I
had
a
year
to
develop
the
project,
the
required
formal
report
consisted
of
between
twenty
and
thirty
pages.
These
pages
included
hypothesis,
research,
analysis,
and
conclusions
among
other
parts.
Finally,
because
the
results
were
unique
to
the
project
and
also
because
the
project
relied
heavily
on
technical
terms
which
the
average
individual
would
not
recognize,
I
expanded
my
experience
as
a
writer
by
learning
to
focus
on
my
audience.
Throughout
high
school,
I
constantly
heard
references
made
towards
"the
nuns
and
their
grammar."
Although
I
encountered
few
religious
in
my
elementary
education,
I
believe
that
Catholic
schools
stress
the
importance
of
grammar
and
exposing
the
many
different
definitions
and
genre
of
literature.
These
priorities
are
most
visibly
represented
in
the
language
arts
examinations
and
the
countless
hours
of
sentence
diagramming
that
I
endured.
Therefore,
I
feel
that
along
the
earlier
parts
of
my
travels
as
a
writer
I
have,
at
the
very
least,
been
exposed
to
the
many
different
kinds
of
"school
writing,"
many
of
which
I
have
created.
In
retrospect,
one
of
the
biggest
confidence
boosts
I
received
for
my
writing
occurred
in
my
sophomore
year
in
high
school.
My
teacher
that
year
was
an
eccentric
individual
with
an
extremely
sarcastic
sense
of
humor.
Mr.
Kenig
was
infamous
throughout
the
school
and
a
favorite
of
all
the
students.
Besides
his
unique
personality,
he
had
a
gift
for
relating
works
of
literature
to
a
bunch
of
sixteen-year-olds
more
interested
in
learning
to
drive
then
the
works
of
Shakespeare
and
JD
Salinger.
For
this
reason,
everyone
seemed
eager
to
impress
Mr.
Kenig,
and
his
compliments
to
individual
students
were
highly
sought.
Our
first
writing
assignment
for
the
year
manifested
itself
in
a
composition
entitled
"Why
I
Am
Unique."
After
reviewing
the
thirty
compositions
of
my
classmates,
Mr.
Kenig
expressed
his
disappointment
in
the
results
of
the
assignment
with
the
exception
of
a
few.
However,
he
classified
my
paper
as
exceptional.
Therefore,
he
read
the
reasons
why
I
was
unique
in
their
entirety
to
my
entire
class.
This
was
the
biggest
compliment
that
his
students
received.
Several
reasons
exist
why
this
incident
stands
out
in
my
growth
as
a
writer.
Although
it
was
not
the
first
compliment
I
received
for
my
writing,
it
was
the
one
I
most
highly
regarded.
Mr.
Kenig
represented
the
authority
on
writing
and
my
peers
also
valued
his
opinion.
Therefore,
I
had
not
only
managed
to
impress
the
teacher,
but
also
my
classmates.
One
of
my
major
character
flaws
lies
my
lack
of
confidence
in
myself.
This
encounter
helped
to
raise
my
opinion
of
my
abilities,
and
this
positive
attitude
carried
over
into
my
other
papers
throughout
the
years.
Around
the
same
time
that
I
was
revealing
why
I
was
a
unique
individual,
I
feel
that
I
also
learned
another
important
skill,
the
ability
to
focus
my
writing
on
a
specific
audience.
Many
of
my
high
school
history
classes
were
classified
as
advanced
placement;
therefore,
they
focused
strongly
on
preparing
for
the
Advanced
Placement
Examination
in
May.
These
Advanced
Placement
Examinations
included
Data
Based
Questions,
or
as
my
classmates
and
I
fondly
learned
to
call
them,
DBQs.
The
purpose
of
these
essays
was
to
include
both
knowledge
we
gained
throughout
the
year
in
class
along
with
the
information
supplied
in
the
documents
provided
into
a
well
organized
essay
which
represented
my
understanding
of
the
issue
in
question.
These
essays
relied
heavily
on
providing
background
information
and
drawing
conclusions
from
this
information
in
a
limited
amount
of
time.
Therefore,
the
teachers
spent
much
of
the
year
attempting
to
aid
us
in
learning
to
include
this
information,
not
as
simply
as
a
list
of
important
individuals
and
their
accomplishments,
but
a
well
written
explanation
of
how
these
dates
and
faces
support
our
conclusions
to
the
proposed
question.
However,
the
most
important
influence
and
developmental
period
in
my
history
as
a
writer
occurred
during
my
senior
year
at
Cardinal
O'Hara.
That
year
I
was
privileged
to
have
Dr.
Ciociola,
or
Dr.
Gail
as
she
affectionately
became
known,
as
my
English
teacher.
Unlike
many
of
my
previous
teachers,
Dr.
Gail
did
not
merely
focus
on
preparing
us
for
the
Advanced
Placement
Exam
at
the
end
of
the
year.
She
focused
on
changing
our
view
of
writing
as
well
as
literature
in
general.
Every
Monday,
Dr.
Gail
would
start
class
by
asking
us
to
articulate
on
our
"literary
experiences"
from
the
past
week.
Throughout
the
course
of
the
year,
she
helped
us
to
realize
that
our
literary
experiences
did
not
simply
occur
when
we
read
a
book
that
had
been
deemed
a
work
of
literature.
"Literary
experiences"
happen
not
only
through
reading,
but
also
through
movies,
plays,
and
other
works
of
drama.
I
realized
that
these
performances
began
as
written
narratives
and
later
became
performances.
These
works
allowed
the
writer
to
express
their
views
and
opinions,
and
they
also
permit
the
audience
to
inject
their
own
opinions
and
observations.
These
"literary
experiences"
also
occurred
through
music.
Finally,
these
"literary
experiences"
manifested
themselves
in
my
own
writing.
Though
our
writing,
we
present
our
views
to
our
audience.
Our
audience
may
be
the
instructor,
our
classmates,
a
professional
society,
or
possibly
ourselves.
By
realizing
the
purpose
and
the
possibilities
for
writing,
Dr.
Gail
instilled
in
me
a
desire
to
improve
my
writing
and
to
appreciate
the
literature
around
me.
Dr.
Gail
improved
our
writing
in
many
ways.
First
of
all,
she
improved
our
attitude
towards
it.
This
opened
the
doors
to
improving
our
styles
of
writing.
One
of
the
most
influential
exercises
she
fondly
referred
to
as
"trash
days."
On
these
occasions
Dr.
C
would
photocopy
randomly
selected
essays
to
distribute
to
the
entire
class.
The
class
then
picked
apart
and
complimented
these
randomly
selected
essays.
Members
of
the
class
discussed
everything
from
grammar
mishaps
to
confusing
sentences
to
styles
worth
imitating.
In
this
ways,
the
class
learned
from
the
mistakes
of
each
other.
Also,
the
rest
of
the
class
could
then
utilize
the
strong
points
of
each
writer.
Dr.
Gail
did
not
assign
typical
writing
assignments.
For
example,
in
the
month
of
February,
each
individual
selected
a
minority
author.
This
assignment
then
required
each
individual
to
read
one
of
their
author's
works
and
finally
to
research
criticisms
and
opinions
of
their
writing.
After
the
completion
of
the
final
paper,
everyone
presented
their
author
to
the
class
and
along
with
a
bibliography
of
his
or
her
works
and
criticisms.
In
this
way,
I
became
exposed
to
twenty
different
minority
writers
and
could
continue
to
study
them
on
my
own
if
I
wished.
Another
unique
assignment
of
Dr.
Gail's
was
the
ten-minute
play
I
composed.
I
had
never
before
written
my
own
work
of
drama.
This
assignment
constituted
a
unique
experience
because
I
had
to
consider
the
medium
through
which
I
was
supposedly
presenting
my
character
and
ideas.
This
assignment
helped
me
to
gain
a
deeper
appreciation
for
the
many
dramas
that
I
have
read.
Finally,
Dr.
C
was
instrumental
in
shaping
my
writing
because
of
the
harsh
standards
she
expected
from
the
class.
Two
of
my
favorite
papers
which
I
wrote
were
my
comparison
of
Long
Days
Journey
Into
Night
with
Death
of
a
Salesman
and
my
autobiography.
Through
these
papers,
Dr
Gail
helped
me
define
a
style
of
writing
that
worked
for
me.
Her
individual
attention
aided
me
in
organizing
my
papers
and
in
deciding
when
additional
background
information
increased
the
clarity
of
my
writing.
Finally,
Dr
Gail
taught
me
the
importance
of
a
well-defined
thesis
paragraph,
it
sets
the
mood
for
the
rest
of
the
composition.
My
admiration
for
my
favorite
English
teacher
could
go
on
for
pages;
however,
I
feel
that
my
gratitude
towards
her
is
best
expressed
in
my
own
attempts
to
improve
my
writing
as
well
as
my
thirst
for
"literary
experiences."
I
classify
my
time
with
Dr.
Gail
as
one
of
the
best
learning
experiences
of
my
academic
career,
and
my
best
experience
as
a
writer.
Lafayette
College
has
provided
me
with
two
classes
focusing
on
improving
my
ability
to
express
myself
through
my
writing.
My
FYS
class
left
me
feeling
that
I
had
adequately
prepared
for
the
challenges
that
I
would
face
as
a
college
writer.
To
me,
adequate
preparation
means
that
I
knew
the
style
of
writing
which
worked
for
me
and
that
my
writing
equaled
that
of
my
fellow
scholars.
However,
my
Professionalism
and
Engineering
Ethics
class
did
challenge
my
ability
as
a
writer.
This
class
focused
on
technical
writing.
In
this
type
of
writing
the
author
should
avoid
redundant
phrases
and
complicated
words
that
hinder
the
individual's
ability
to
understand
the
purpose
of
the
paper.
I
believe
that
this
class
challenged
my
writing
because,
throughout
my
career
as
a
writer,
I
have
been
instructed
on
creative
writing
as
well
as
non-scientific
research
writing.
However,
this
was
the
first
instruction
I
have
ever
experienced
in
technical
writing.
In
this
sense,
I
feel
that
I
was
inadequately
prepared
for
college
writing.
Finally,
as
I
have
examined
my
journey
as
a
writer,
I
have
realized
the
importance
that
writing
plays
outside
of
the
academic
world
in
which
I
currently
reside.
Throughout
the
past
two
summers,
I
have
constantly
relied
on
my
abilities
as
a
writer
to
communicate
my
ideas
to
the
individuals
with
whom
I
worked.
However,
I
feel
the
most
important
way
that
I
use
my
ability
to
write
is
to
express
my
daily
adventures,
trials,
successes,
and
feeling
to
my
family
and
friends
through
both
email
and
snail
mail.
Whether
brief
emails
to
my
friends
at
different
schools
or
cards
telling
my
family
how
much
they
mean
to
me,
writing
is
an
important
way
that
I
express
who
I
am
to
the
individuals
important
to
me.
My
growth
into
literacy
continues
every
day
when
I
attempt
to
articulate
my
knowledge,
conclusions,
and
feelings
to
the
world
around
me.
Many
individuals
and
experiences
have
shaped
my
style
of
writing.
The
combination
of
the
responses
I
have
received
to
my
writing,
the
insights
that
others
have
shared
with
me,
as
well
as
my
opinions
for
the
subjects
I
reflect
upon
and
the
audiences
to
whom
I
direct
my
narrative
have
become
my
history
as
a
writer.
