After
compiling
a
complete
history
as
a
writer,
from
my
first
coloring
book
to
my
last
high
school
term
paper,
reviewing
my
past
year
as
a
developing
writer
should
be
an
easy
task.
One
year
of
college
writing
assignments
and
WA
work
couldn't
possibly
be
harder
to
sift
through
than
an
entire
literary
history.
To
write
my
literary
history
I
had
to
examine
all
of
my
past
experiences
and
determine
how
I
got
to
where
I
was,
a
freshly
appointed
WA,
eager
to
change
the
lives
of
countless
writers.
Now,
in
the
addendum
to
that
history,
my
task
becomes
determining
where
I've
gone
since
then.
Am
I
still
the
same
writer?
Am
I
still
the
same
WA?
Did
I
actually
affect
anyone?
Initially,
I
thought
my
writing
didn't
change
much
at
all
over
the
past
year.
I
spent
the
year
helping
others
with
their
writing,
not
working
on
mine.
But
my
work
with
other
writers
changed
more
than
I
first
realized.
While
my
style
of
writing
and
writing
process
remained
largely
the
same,
my
perspective
on
writing
as
a
whole
expanded
and
advanced
to
include
aspects
I'd
never
considered.
Before
I
became
I
WA,
I
never
gave
much
thought
to
the
actual
writing
process.
Most
of
my
writing
is
done
without
outlines
or
countless
drafts.
This
year,
however,
the
practice
of
writing
an
outline,
one
that
I
never
found
particularly
helpful,
became
an
important
part
of
my
WA
conferences.
Going
over
an
outline
helped
the
writer
organize
his/her
thoughts
and
helped
me
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
direction
that
he/she
wanted
the
paper
to
go
in.
While
my
outlines
still
remain
absent
in
my
prewriting
process,
I've
begun
to
construct
a
post-writing
outline
from
an
already-finished
paper.
I've
found
that
this
type
of
outline,
instead
of
organizing
and
focusing
my
paper
before
writing,
helps
me
to
ensure
that
I
accomplished
all
of
the
goals
that
the
paper
required.
An
outline
made
from
the
finished
paper
can
identify
problems
in
sequence
and
clarity.
I
now
find
myself
advising
writers
to
make
some
sort
of
outline,
either
before
the
writing
actually
occurs
to
begin
the
writing
process,
or
after
the
writing
is
completed
to
make
sure
that
the
writing
process
is,
in
fact,
finished.
Before
my
work
as
a
WA,
I
never
really
thought
much
about
my
audience.
I
always
thought
of
an
audience
of
one,
the
professor
responsible
for
determining
my
grade.
But
as
a
WA
working
in
courses
outside
of
my
discipline,
I
came
to
recognize
how
important
it
can
be
to
appeal
to
an
audience
consisting
of
more
than
the
one
holding
the
red
pen.
The
first
course
I
was
assigned
to
was
an
Engineering
Ethics
class.
I
was
worried
that
I
wouldn't
be
able
to
help
the
students
with
their
papers.
I
quickly
found
that
my
lack
of
engineering
knowledge
wasn't
problematic
and
that
it
might
even
prove
to
be
beneficial.
Because
I
had
limited
knowledge
of
the
technical
aspects
of
the
paper,
I
found
it
easier
to
focus
on
developing
certain
components
of
good
writing,
specifically
clarity,
organization
and
word
choice.
A
good
paper
appealed
not
just
to
the
professor,
nor
to
only
an
uneducated
reader,
but
struck
a
nice
balance
between
advanced
knowledge
of
a
subject
and
complete
ignorance
it.
This
is
subtle
component
of
effective
writing
that
I
now
apply
to
my
own
writing,
especially
as
I
consider
future
writings
that
may
not
be
created
with
the
intention
of
earning
a
good
grade.
A
less
tangible
aspect
of
my
writing
personality
includes
a
shift
in
the
way
I
read
literary
works,
both
others
and
mine.
I've
found
that
a
change
in
the
way
I
read
literary
pieces
can
lead
to
changes
in
the
way
I
write.
While
these
changes
may
not
be
obvious,
they
aren't
as
insignificant
as
I
once
thought.
Being
a
WA
forced
me
to
read
more
critically
and
pay
attention
to
the
specifics,
but
at
the
same
time
read
the
piece
as
a
whole.
Instead
of
isolating
thesis
statements,
transition
sentences,
and
organization,
I
learned
to
appreciate
how
these
elements
combine
to
make
a
good
paper.
This
lesson
came
not
only
from
reading
good
papers
that
contained
all
the
necessary
elements,
but
also,
often
more
effectively,
from
reading
papers
that
were
missing
one
or
more
important
factions.
Almost
without
realizing
it,
I
began
to
strive
to
focus
on
developing
my
paper
as
a
whole
instead
of
writing
a
really
good
thesis
statement,
slacking
on
the
transitions
and
hoping
to
make
up
for
it
with
organization.
Constantly
reading
and
evaluating
the
writing
of
others
developed
a
consciousness
of
the
whole
paper
in
my
own
writing.
While
the
past
year
caused
my
writing
to
change
and
develop,
it
also
changed
my
ideas
of
the
purpose
of
the
WA
program
as
well
as
my
ability
to
help
other
writers.
My
first
initial
idea
of
the
WA
duty
was
one
that
included
reading
a
full
paper
and
correcting
major
writing
flaws.
I
thought
of
my
role
as
extremely
important,
thinking
that
I
had
the
power
the
change
and
improve
the
way
my
peers
wrote.
I
quickly
realized
that
I
was
mistaken
as
to
both
the
purpose
of
the
program
and
my
role
in
it.
Many
of
my
meetings
were
conducted
with
rough
drafts,
outlines
or
sometimes
even
simply
an
idea.
Instead
of
receiving
full
papers
ready
to
be
scrutinized,
I
was
stepping
in
at
the
beginning
stages
of
the
writing
process.
Because
writing
comes
fairly
easily
to
me,
I
didn't
realize
that
the
process
of
writing
can
include
numerous
steps
and
can
be
a
struggle
for
many.
Working
with
the
writers,
I
realized
that
instead
of
changing
their
writing,
I
was
helping
them
develop
it
through
a
long
and
ever-changing
process.
Working
through
this
process
with
different
writers,
I
also
came
to
realize
that
my
role
was
far
less
important
than
I
imagined.
I
wasn't
the
all-knowing,
influential
writing
guru
that
I
imagined.
The
most
important
party
in
the
WA/writer
relationship
was
definitely
not
the
WA.
I
learned
that
the
most
effective
conferences
seemed
to
be
the
ones
in
which
the
writer
did
most
of
the
talking.
The
writers'
input
on
their
own
writing
was
often
more
insightful
and
helpful
than
mine.
My
role
often
became
helping
them
realize
this.
I
think
it
surprised
both
the
writers
and
me
that
the
person
that
could
be
most
helpful
during
the
conferences
was
the
writing
him/herself.
The
past
year
taught
me
that
my
role
as
a
WA
was
far
different
than
the
editor/grammar
police/critic
that
I
might
have
first
imagined.
My
role
consisted
of
listening
and
asking
questions,
actions
I
had
initially
imagined
coming
from
the
writer.
So
not
only
did
I
develop
as
a
writer
over
the
past
year,
I
also
developed
as
a
Writing
Associate.
I
began
my
inaugural
year
as
a
WA
with
impressions,
expectations
and
hopes.
Over
the
year
my
ideas
of
myself
as
a
writer
and
myself
as
a
WA
changed
and
grew
in
ways
that
I
could
never
have
imagined.
Many
of
these
changes
at
first
seemed
insignificant
to
me.
When
I
received
this
assignment
my
worry
was
that
I
didn't
have
much
to
write
about.
Superficially,
I
couldn't
find
any
major
changes
in
my
writing
or
in
my
literary
self-concept.
Once
I
dug
deeper,
however,
I
found
slight
changes
that
combined
to
create
a
very
different
writer/WA
than
I
was
one
year
ago.
