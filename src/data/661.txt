My
history
as
a
writer
is
neither
smooth
nor
purposeful,
and
would
probably
resemble
the
flight
of
a
blind
pilot
if
mapped
visually.
My
journey
is
outlined
by
two
sides,
which
I
have
found
myself
waffling
between
during
my
twenty
years.
The
brighter
part
of
my
journey
contains
creativity,
enthusiasm,
and
the
occasional
achievement.
The
opposing
side
is
characterized
by
halts,
regressions,
and
disenchantment.
All
of
my
experiences,
good
and
bad,
have
given
me
essential
insight
and
stimulated
my
growth
as
a
writer.
I
currently
see
myself
with
a
new
clarity,
gripping
a
pen,
suspended
over
the
past
and
with
an
eye
towards
the
future.
I
was
taught
to
read
very
early
in
my
life,
a
circumstance
to
which
I
attribute
my
love
for
words
and
literature.
While
I
was
highly
successful
as
a
reader
in
elementary
school,
my
writing
career
was
hindered
by
my
fleeting
attention
span
and
tragically
banal
life.
I
received
good
grades
on
all
of
my
literary
masterpieces,
but
I
aspired
to
write
on
the
same
level
as
the
authors
whose
books
I
read
so
voraciously.
Our
teachers
encouraged
us
to
write
about
ourselves,
a
Nwrite
what
you
knowO
approach
that
produced
a
series
of
classic
assignments
such
as,
NWhat
I
Did
during
Winter
Break.O
But
I
was
not
satiated
by
these
topics.
During
a
shopping
trip,
I
childishly
coerced
my
parents
into
buying
me
a
diary
so
that
I
could
record
the
drama
of
my
young
life.
They
were
supportive
of
my
desire
to
write,
since
I
glaringly
lacked
any
musical
or
artistic
creativity.
The
diary
was
filled
with
black
pages
and
was
accompanied
by
a
set
of
creamily
fluorescent
Milky
Pens.
I
vowed
to
write
every
day
so
that
when
I
got
older
I
would
have
a
vivid
record
of
my
life.
After
a
few
days
of
dutifully
writing
in
my
diary,
I
found
myself
straying
from
my
goal.
I
found
other
things
to
do
rather
than
write.
Apathy
and
a
lack
of
patience
remain
the
largest
hazard
to
my
writing
career,
although
I
have
undoubtedly
improved
from
my
elementary
years.
I
soon
gave
up
on
that
diary,
which
still
remains
in
my
closet
as
a
ghostly
reminder
of
failure.
Months
later,
I
insisted
that
my
parents
buy
me
a
mechanical
Password
Journal,
which
only
opened
when
my
voice
spoke
the
password.
I
thought
the
novelty
of
the
high-tech
journal
would
stir
my
creative
juices
and
encourage
me
to
write
daily.
But
once
again,
my
lack
of
patience
and
frustration
with
my
inability
to
make
my
voice
heard
through
words
foiled
my
writing.
I
would
write
every
day
for
a
week,
and
then
forget
to
write
for
a
few
days.
Then
I
would
revisit
my
journal
and
continue
to
scribe
my
experiences.
Sometimes
I
would
forget
my
password
and
physically
pry
the
journal
open
so
I
could
access
my
journal,
a
humble
manifestation
of
my
struggle
with
dedication
and
boredom.
When
I
reached
middle
school,
I
was
thrust
into
the
world
of
rules.
The
approved
formula
for
a
paper
included
an
opening
paragraph,
three
body
paragraphs,
and
a
conclusion.
The
recommended
best
way
to
start
a
paper
was
to
use
a
quote
or
cite
a
source.
Language
arts
teachers
passed
out
lists
of
pre-approved
transition
phrases,
which
had
to
be
used
in
every
essay
to
obtain
an
NA.O
Grammar
and
mechanics
were
a
primary
source
of
feedback
on
revised
papers.
I
knew
that
my
writing
was
awkward,
and
there
was
nothing
I
could
do
about
it
but
bide
my
time
and
try
to
improve.
Words
stumbled
off
my
fingers
and
I
grappled
with
them
to
make
my
sentences
exactly
how
the
teacher
wanted
them.
While
my
work
ethic
improved
during
middle
school
and
I
took
a
greater
interest
in
writing,
I
became
increasingly
aware
of
my
own
lack
of
knowledge
and
authority
on
topics.
When
writing
a
paper
on
the
Titanic,
I
came
across
scholarly
sources
that
I
could
not
understand.
This
frustrated
me,
yet
I
did
not
become
discouraged.
I
persevered
in
my
quest
for
knowledge
and
became
a
better
writer
because
of
it.
Though
my
lack
of
knowledge
and
ability
was
frustrating,
I
had
an
even
worse
experience
with
the
question
of
originality.
In
fifth
grade,
I
wrote
an
essay
for
a
D.A.R.E.
program.
Six
winners
would
be
chosen
and
received
a
stuffed
D.A.R.E.
lion
and
a
gift
certificate.
I
worked
hard
on
my
essay,
following
all
the
rules
to
the
best
of
my
young
ability.
One
night
shortly
before
the
essay
was
due,
I
asked
my
father
to
read
over
my
paper.
When
he
returned
it
to
me,
he
had
slashed
the
essay
with
scribbles
and
cross-outs,
inserting
his
own
words
and
sentences
into
the
paper.
I
felt
like
the
piece
was
not
my
own
anymore,
but
I
obeyed
his
recommendations
and
corrected
the
essay
according
to
his
markings.
I
won
the
contest,
but
his
victorious
crowing
that
my
essay
would
not
have
won
without
his
sage
advice
marred
my
happiness.
While
I
was
too
immature
to
describe
my
feelings
at
that
time,
I
now
reflect
upon
the
rape
of
my
paper
and
vow
to
never
undermine
the
literary
originality
of
another
person
or
allow
someone
else
to
fully
manipulate
my
writing
again.
The
remainder
of
middle
school
passed
uneventfully,
and
I
gradually
began
to
keep
my
writing
away
from
my
parentsO
prying
eyes.
High
school
was
the
turning
point
in
my
writing
journey.
It
was
during
this
time
that
I
realized
a
passion
and
affinity
for
literature
and
for
writing.
However,
I
did
not
immediately
find
success
as
a
writer.
As
a
freshman,
I
received
a
D
on
my
first
paper
in
World
History.
I
was
a
devastated
young
perfectionist.
Following
a
spat
of
tears,
I
realized
that
I
would
have
to
be
better
if
I
wanted
to
succeed
in
a
more
demanding
academic
environment.
It
took
a
few
months
of
hard
work
before
I
fully
acclimated
to
the
strain
placed
upon
me
and
began
to
excel
as
a
writer.
During
my
first
two
years
of
high
school,
I
learned
to
write
in
an
organized,
clear
and
concise
manner.
To
indulge
in
a
clich,
I
consider
this
the
calm
before
the
storm
that
I
have
become
enveloped
in
over
the
past
four
years.
During
junior
and
senior
year
of
high
school,
I
enrolled
in
the
International
Baccalaureate
(IB)
program.
This
college
preparatory
program
included
internationally
graded
exams,
essays,
and
oral
presentations.
Suddenly,
higher-level
writing
and
analysis
skills
were
demanded
of
me.
I
was
exposed
to
a
variety
of
new
writing
formats
and
topics.
In
an
IB
psychology
class
I
learned
to
write
formal
APA-style
lab
reports.
In
my
required
Theory
of
Knowledge
course,
I
delved
into
epistemological
issues
and
reconciled
philosophical
viewpoints
in
my
papers.
Perhaps
most
demanding
was
my
senior
year
World
History
teacher,
who
forced
us
to
write
essays
constantly.
She
even
assigned
us
five
essays
over
spring
break.
The
culmination
of
the
IB
program
was
a
fifteen-page
paper
on
a
topic
of
our
choice.
I
was
overwhelmed
by
the
workload
during
these
two
years,
but
it
was
refreshing
to
be
challenged
and
the
constant
practice
helped
me
improve
my
writing
style.
It
provided
me
with
a
lot
of
experience
writing
and
a
variety
of
ways
to
approach
any
writing
task
I
might
be
presented
in
the
future.
Perhaps
equally
as
important
as
my
academic
career,
late
high
school
was
the
first
time
I
felt
myself
consciously
emulate
a
writer
and
also
marked
the
beginning
of
my
poetic
career.
In
English,
we
read
Ernest
HemingwayOs
The
Sun
Also
Rises.
I
was
struck
by
the
concise
nature
of
HemingwayOs
sentences
and
the
delicate
subtleties
hidden
beneath
simple
language.
It
was
a
stark
contrast
to
the
stereotypical
literature
that
I
had
been
exposed
to
in
middle
school
and
early
high
school.
I
began
searching
for
my
own
voice,
the
holy
grail
of
every
writer.
Amidst
the
tangles
of
navigating
the
high
school
social
scene
and
the
rise
and
fall
of
new
relationships,
I
found
comfort
in
my
developing
mastery
of
language.
Looking
back
now,
I
perceive
a
whiney,
self-absorbed
voice
in
my
writings.
I
blame
hormones
and
teen
angst.
Despite
their
greenness,
these
early
creative
products
were
essential
to
my
development
as
a
writer.
My
first
year
at
Lafayette
was
a
time
of
great
personal
and
literary
development.
When
I
first
began
writing
papers,
I
was
concerned
that
they
would
not
meet
college
standards.
Working
with
a
WA
made
me
feel
a
lot
more
comfortable
and
confident
about
my
writing.
I
discovered
that
high
school
had
adequately
prepared
me
for
college
when
I
began
receiving
positive
feedback
from
my
course
instructors.
My
first
English
class
at
Lafayette,
Literary
Questions,
broadened
my
reading
and
writing
horizons.
I
learned
about
various
forms
that
literature,
including
verse,
prose,
and
even
slam
poetry.
One
of
the
greatest
challenges
for
me
was
an
assignment
to
write
a
villanelle.
Even
though
it
was
a
brief
assignment,
it
required
more
creative
thought
and
planning
than
many
essays
I
wrote.
Also,
most
of
my
creative
writing
in
the
past
had
been
written
without
formal
constraints,
so
it
felt
strange
to
squeeze
my
ideas
into
the
confines
of
poetic
structure.
I
was
also
required
to
take
an
Introduction
to
Psychology
class,
which
included
a
lab.
This
lab
class
taught
me
how
to
construct
lab
reports
in
stricter
accordance
with
APA
guidelines.
This
style
of
writing
differed
from
my
previous
writings
in
English
classes,
because
it
required
extremely
concise
and
specialized
language.
Meetings
with
a
student
lab
assistant
greatly
aided
my
transition
into
scientific
language
and
writing.
My
freshman
year
at
Lafayette
served
as
a
developmental
time
for
me,
during
which
I
strengthened
the
foundation
of
my
writing
skills.
During
my
sophomore
year
at
Lafayette,
I
began
to
struggle
with
the
idea
of
written
communication
and
originality.
The
philosophical
ramifications
of
literary
creation
fascinated
me.
The
futility
of
language
when
trying
to
communicate
an
idea
is
an
overwhelming
thought
that
continually
daunts
me
while
I
write.
This
idea
confronted
me
most
vividly
in
my
Metaphysical
Poetry
class
during
spring
semester.
I
read
metaphysical
poets
of
the
seventeenth
century,
who
invented
functional
metaphors
that
had
not
previously
been
used
in
literature.
It
was
impressive
to
observe
their
wit
and
clever
manipulation
of
language.
One
of
the
skills
I
learned
from
that
class
was
an
ability
to
read
closely
and
to
ponder
the
purpose
behind
each
word
of
a
text.
I
also
gained
respect
for
metaphysical
poets,
which
increased
when
I
was
given
the
assignment
to
write
my
own
metaphysical
poem.
This
was
one
of
my
favorite
writing
experiences,
since
the
class
spent
a
few
hours
discussing
and
analyzing
our
individual
products.
I
wrote
a
poem
that
compared
the
action
of
a
printing
press
to
the
sexual
and
emotional
relationship
between
two
people,
focusing
primarily
on
the
impermanence
of
ink.
My
poem
was
well
received
and
I
enjoyed
discussing
the
thought
and
intent
that
each
student
writer
put
behind
their
poetry.
However,
I
still
found
it
difficult
to
communicate
my
exact
ideas
in
writing,
since
readers
did
not
share
my
experience
and
perception.
My
internal
grappling
with
originality
continues
and
there
is
no
end
in
sight.
In
my
Literary
Taboos
class,
I
read
about
taboo
subjects
such
as
sexuality.
I
realized
that
even
topics
that
were
taboo
and
unique
had
been
written
about
and
explored
frequently.
Sometimes
it
seems
as
though
everything
I
write
about
has
already
been
written
about.
Even
that
topic
(originality)
has
already
been
beaten
to
death,
yet
this
truth
cannot
be
ignored.
Also
in
Literary
Taboos,
I
learned
about
active
reading
and
writing.
In
the
concept
of
active
reading,
a
reader
changes
his
lifestyle
as
a
result
of
what
he
has
read.
I
hope
to
someday
achieve
the
ability
to
write
actively,
and
persuade
others
to
change
for
the
better
of
the
world.
My
journey
as
a
writer
has
been
tumultuous
yet
rewarding.
My
personal
creative
writings
are
greatly
impacted
by
other
writers
and
what
I
learn
in
a
scholastic
environment.
I
still
sometimes
find
myself
burdening
my
writerOs
voice
with
banal
metaphors
and
dramatic
lines,
yet
now
I
try
to
refrain.
I
seek
to
explore
my
own
experiences
through
alternative
descriptions,
and
find
satisfaction
in
choosing
suitable
and
interesting
language.
I
look
forward
to
the
continued
development
of
my
writing
skills.
