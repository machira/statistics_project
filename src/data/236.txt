Recent
Writing
History
Project
for
Workshop
July
30,
1999
In
the
recent
year,
significant
changes
have
occurred
in
my
own
writing.
A
reference
back
to
my
freshman
year
shows
that
my
writing
style
has
become
more
relaxed.
This
new
style
becomes
more
apparent
in
my
sophomore
year
writing
samples.
I
focus
my
time
more
on
the
content
of
my
conveyance
rather
than
the
poetry
of
my
conveyance.
I
changed
my
style
when
I
noticed
that
my
papers
frequently
strayed
from
the
assignment.
I
would
become
so
enraptured
in
my
own
poetic
writing
experience
that
I
would
wander
from
the
topic.
The
resulting
paper
would
be
more
stream
of
consciousness
than
precise
analysis
of
the
topic.
The
reason
for
my
former
writing
style
can
be
attributed
to
one
simple
misconception.
I
falsely
believed
that
without
lofty
poetic
diction
my
own
competence
as
a
writer
would
be
compromised.
For
quite
some
time
I
wrote
in
this
manner,
but
Professor
Miller's
course
in
political
theory
showed
me
the
error
of
my
ways.
The
class
was
exploratory
in
nature,
it
focused
little
on
grades
and
more
on
classroom
discussion.
The
semester
grade
was
comprised
of
three
papers,
which
was
little
in
comparison
to
the
amount
of
required
reading.
Strangely
enough,
my
single
outstanding
grade
was
the
exact
opposite
of
my
expectations.
The
paper
with
less
poetic
diction
and
more
analysis
pleased
the
professor
more.
This
fact
startled
me,
the
paper
with
less
poetic
diction
was
written
in
less
time.
This
realization
occurred
in
the
spring
semester
of
my
freshman
year,
which
would
be
before
August
1998.
The
paper
topic
at
hand
asks
for
experiences
after
August
1998.
Therefore,
I
am
guilty
of
including
an
experience
prior
to
the
assigned
time
span-
However,
I
do
this
for
a
purpose.
I
did
not
have
any
writing
courses
in
the
fall
of
my
sophomore
year,
and
so
I
never
fully
explored
my
new
writing
style
until
the
next
semester.
The
one
semester
that
I
lacked
a
writing
course,
strangely
enough,
was
the
one
semester
that
I
began
as
a
writing
associate.
I
felt
that
my
writing
hiatus
did
not
make
sense,
I
was
a
writing
associate
who
was
not
even
enrolled
in
a
writing
course.
Unfortunately,
this
did
not
benefit
my
peers
or
myself
in
the
first
semester
of
my
WA
employment.
I
had
realized
the
error
of
my
own
writing
style,
but
I
had
not
developed
and
implemented
a
new
style.
Consequently,
my
peers
caught
me
in
a
transition
period.
Before
I
continue,
I
need
to
explain
some
essential
mechanics
of
political
theory,
which
will
reveal
the
unique
nature
of
my
WA
experience.
The
course
is
like
none
other.
It
can
be
easily
likened
to
writing
psychological
papers
in
APA
style.
In
short,
the
writing
itself
is
fastidious.
Normally
accepted
methods
of
writing
a
paper
are
forgotten
in
political
theory.
It
is
a
different
universe,
where
prior
rules
do
not
apply.
For
example,
a
normal
paper
must
contain
an
introduction,
thesis,
body,
and
conclusion.
A
political
theory
paper
includes
two
theoretical
sides,
which
are
both
explored
in
the
introduction.
It
then
must
contain
a
thesis
and
a
"because"
clause
within
the
thesis.
It
must
include
a
specified
amount
of
text
and
analysis
and
include
a
counter-argument.
The
purpose
of
the
counter-argument
is
not
to
refute
alternate
arguments.
Instead,
it
must
acknowledge
and
argue
the
counter-argument.
In
any
regular
course,
failure
to
refute
an
argument
in
the
counter-argument
distracts
from
the
thesis.
The
opposite
is
true
in
a
theory
paper.
Finally,
the
conclusion
does
not
summarize
the
prior
arguments;
the
conclusion
collects
the
arguments
and
applies
them
to
contemporary
society
and
asks,
"what
does
this
mean?"
Simply
put,
omission
of
any
mechanism
would
severely
change
one's
final
grade.
This
unique
writing
style
not
only
changed
my
own
writing
but
also
changed
my
entire
thought
process.
This
was
evident
in
the
spring
99
when
I
enrolled
in
a
writing
course
"State
and
Local
Government."
Ironically,
I
had
the
same
WA
as
political
theory.
In
that
respect,
I
was
an
extremely
fortunate
student
because
the
paper
I
handed
to
my
WA
was
too
theoretical
in
nature
and
wavered
between
two
arguments.
My
WA
was
able
to
empathize
with
my
struggle
to
develop
one
side
of
an
argument
and
not
the
other,
an
action
that
would
be
blasphemous
in
a
theory
paper.
The
paper
topic
specifically
asked
for
one
single
argument
on
some
public
policy
issue,
and
in
my
wavering
I
had
failed
to
accomplish
such.
He
said,
"I
think
that
Professor
Miller
s
theory
course
has
brainwashed
you."
And
he
was
entirely
correct.
Being
a
WA
in
a
theory
course
while
not
being
enrolled
in
any
other
writing
course
effectively
erased
my
concept
of
standard
writing.
The
special
nature
of
a
political
theory
paper
corrupted
my
concept
of
the
WA's
function
in
a
meeting.
This
in
combination
with
my
inexperience
as
a
WA
and
the
eccentricities
of
my
Professor
made
a
horrible
mixture.
Professor
Miller,
after
encountering
many
problems
with
the
mechanics
of
a
theory
paper,
decided
to
test
a
new
way
of
writing
a
paper.
Of
the
three
required
papers,
the
first
two
would
be
"baby
steps"
to
the
completed
theory
paper
at
the
end
of
the
semester.
For
the
first
paper,
Professor
Miller
would
supply
the
entire
introduction.
His
students
would
have
to
develop
the
rest.
For
the
second
paper,
he
would
supply
only
part
of
the
introduction
and
require
students
to
choose
an
appropriate
and
interesting
thesis,
which
they
would
in
turn
develop.
For
the
final
paper,
they
were
on
their
own.
His
new
teaching
approach,
in
essence,
forced
me
to
deal
with
content.
Since
Professor
Miller
supplied
the
thesis,
I
had
to
accept
it
as
absolute.
My
function,
therefore,
was
to
ensure
that
my
peers
were
developing
his
provided
thesis
and
not
straying
from
it.
I
approached
my
first
night
of
reading
papers
as
if
I
was
writing
each
one
individually.
My
anal
retentive
personality
had
individual
index
cards
for
each
paper
with
comments
and
content
analysis.
I
also
had
index
cards
of
the
proper
way
to
write
a
theory
paper.
This
was
a
bad
move.
With
all
the
preparation,
one
would
think
that
I
would
be
confident
about
my
upcoming
meetings.
Nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth.
I
remember
the
feeling
in
my
stomach
the
night
prior
to
my
first
meeting,
and
it
was
not
pleasant;
I
hardly
slept.
I
was
still
anxious
while
walking
to
Pardee,
but
some
of
the
tension
faded
when
I
got
through
my
first
meeting.
It
went
surprisingly
well.
In
fact,
I
though
that
most
of
my
conferences
for
that
morning
went
well.
That
afternoon
Lisa
Steirman
also
had
her
conferences.
Prior
to
this,
I
was
alone,
but
now
another
WA
for
Political
Theory
was
within
my
ear.
I
eavesdropped
on
her
conferences,
and
they
shocked
me.
She
was
so
controlling
and
forceful
in
her
meetings.
Her
commanding
approach
revealed
the
disparity
between
her
WA
mentality
and
mine.
I
became
more
concerned
when
I
heard
the
sound
of
scribbling
on
papers
and
her
voice
almost
screaming,
"No!
You
have
not
developed
this
adequately.
What
does
this
say
about
Socrates...Nothing!"
Before
hearing
this,
I
focused
my
efforts
on
simply
the
mechanics
of
a
theory
paper.
I
began
each
meeting
with
a
brief
synopsis
of
the
function
and
elements
of
a
theory
paper
and
whether
those
elements
were
included.
I
spent
little
time
on
the
thesis,
which
was
a
complete
mistake.
Students
left
the
conference
with
a
concept
of
how
to
write
an
ideal
theory
paper.
Unfortunately,
they
did
not
leave
with
an
understanding
of
their
own
theory
paper
and
whether
or
not
it
addressed
the
topic.
After
hearing
other
conferences,
I
changed
my
approach
significantly.
It
became
more
like
Lisa's
conference
(ie.
dealing
with
the
thesis
first).
But
it
was
not
entirely
like
Lisa's
conferences;
I
toned
down
the
authoritative
aspect.
After
the
first
round
of
conferences,
I
seriously
considered
alternatives
to
my
former
WA
approach.
I
did
not
want
to
be
as
commanding
as
was
Lisa.
However,
I
did
not
want
to
remove
all
authority
from
the
conference.
I
examined
my
WA
approach
and
concluded
that
some
degree
of
authority
is
beneficial
to
both
the
WA
and
the
peer.
I
had
taken
the
course
and
received
good
marks;
therefore,
I
had
a
claim
to
some
amount
of
authority.
The
remainder
of
my
WA
appointments
for
the
fall
98
semester
was
somewhat
authoritative.
Once
again,
I
underwent
a
significant
change.
It
was
partly
due
to
my
lack
of
a
writing
course
in
the
first
semester
that
I
approached
the
conferences
with
such
an
aura
of
authority.
When
I
met
with
my
WA
s
for
"State
and
Local
Government"
and
"0il
and
Politics,"
I
realized
that
authority
is
not
needed
in
a
conference.
I
kept
some
amount
of
authority,
but
it
was
only
when
the
theory
paper
lacked
some
essential
structural
elements.
Even
so,
I
would
not
force
the
peer
to
change
the
structure;
I
would
only
warn
him/her
of
the
consequences
of
not
doing
so.
I
also
discovered
that
my
WA
appointments
were
shorter
in
the
second
semester.
They
would
run
about
15
to
20
minutes
as
opposed
to
25
to
30+
minutes.
I
spoke
less
in
the
second
semester
appointments.
I
also
depended
more
upon
posing
questions
that
force
the
peer
to
speak.
I
would
frequently
oppose
their
argument
in
an
effort
to
provoke
thought
and
strengthen
their
theoretical
minds.
I
barely
focused
on
the
structure
of
a
theory
paper,
which
eventually
had
some
minor
consequences.
In
terms
of
rating
which
semester
was
a
better
experience,
the
spring
99
probably
fits
this
criterion.
However,
my
responses
from
peers
have
been
completely
at
odds.
Some
students
showered
me
with
thanks
at
the
end
of
the
semester,
while
others
viewed
me
as
an
idiot.
I
received
more
praise
after
the
spring
99
than
the
fall
This
leads
me
to
believe
that
my
approach
in
the
second
semester
was
much
more
prudent
than
the
prior
semester.
This
upcoming
semester
will
probably
be
the
most
beneficial
to
myself
as
a
WA
and
my
peers
as
students.
I
enrolled
in
Professor
Miller's
"Early
American
Political
Thought."
A
higher
theory
course
will
strengthen
all
aspects
of
my
writing:
both
theoretical
structure
and
theoretical
mindset.
The
course
will
function
to
refresh
myself
as
a
writer
of
theory,
eventually
helping
my
peers
in
the
long
run.
I
must
remember,
however,
to
separate
the
two
courses.
The
worst
thing
that
I
could
do
would
be
to
confuse
and
frustrate
introductory
students
with
advanced
theory.
I
must
be
wary
of
that
drawback.
