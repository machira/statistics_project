Writing
as
a
WA
Project
for
WorkshopNReturning
WA
Although
at
first
I
felt
approaching
this
essay
would
be
more
difficult
than
it
was
to
write
last
yearOs
essay,
which
had
a
much
wider
scope,
the
more
I
began
to
think
about
it,
the
more
I
realized
that
the
changes
IOve
experienced
as
a
writer
and
a
Writing
Associate
over
the
last
year
are
perhaps
more
significant
as
they
are
changes
that
have
occurred
to
me
as
an
experienced
writer,
rather
than
as
a
developing
writer.
What
I
realized
most
from
glancing
back
through
old
essays
and
creative
pieces
is
that
over
the
last
year
I
have
secured
a
solid
voice
for
myself
as
a
writer.
I
am
no
longer
struggling
to
write
within
the
jargon
of
academia,
but
rather
am
comfortable
in
that
form
of
writing
and
have
developed
my
own
assertive
voice
that
pours
from
the
page
with
confidence.
As
any
writer
and
student
I
am
still
changing
and
learning
but
I
have
reached
a
level
of
confidence
in
my
writing
that
for
the
first
time
has
a
permanent
base.
I
have
also
expanded
my
horizon
from
spending
a
semester
in
Scotland.
While
in
Scotland
I
was
exposed
to
new
writers,
new
critiques
and
different
opinions
than
what
I
was
used
to.
This
has
expanded
my
way
of
evaluating
and
viewing
writing.
My
own
writing
has
definitely
improved
from
my
new
experiences,
as
I
feel
nothing
helps
writing
more
than
life
experience.
I
also
believe
being
well
and
widely
read
is
an
asset
to
any
writer.
I
suppose
itOs
fitting
to
continue
with
my
past
WA
experience,
which
is
turn
leads
to
my
ideas
on
the
WA
program
and
what
I
feel
I
can
contribute
this
up
and
coming
semester.
My
experience
as
a
WA
last
fall
was
certainly
not
what
I
expected.
Reflecting
back
on
my
semester
as
a
WA
is
unquestionably
much
more
interesting
now,
after
returning
from
a
semester
in
Europe,
than
my
reflections
directly
following
my
WA
experience.
The
professor
I
worked
with
had
just
returned
from
teaching
in
London
for
six
or
seven
years
(roughly
speaking,
IOm
not
sure
exactly
how
long).
His
teaching
style
seemed,
to
both
me
and
his
FYS
students,
abnormal.
His
class
required
little
written
work
until
the
end
of
the
semester,
where
work
piled
up
quickly.
Where
I
had
toyed
with
the
notion
of
apathy
on
his
part
in
my
own
reflections
of
his
teaching
style
I
now
see
I
misunderstood
cultural
difference.
After
taking
classes
in
the
UK
I
now
see
that
it
is
simply
a
cultural
difference,
classes
in
the
UK
are
typically
approached
in
such
a
manor
as
this
professor
used.
Had
I
been
aware
of
this
earlier,
I
feel
much
of
my
frustration
in
working
with
this
professor
would
have
been
lifted.
Where
at
the
time
I
felt
my
students
were
being
neglected
and
I
ignored.
Now
I
see
the
situation
clearer,
I
find
that
in
no
way
was
the
teaching
sub
par,
just
European.
With
this
understanding
I
became
interested
in
being
a
WA
again
for
I
was
able
to
look
past
the
frustration
I
had
felt
with
the
professor
to
look
at
the
time
I
actually
spend
with
the
FYS
students,
which
was
inevitably
rewarding.
Besides
my
jaunt
in
Europe
I
have
had
another
experience
since
my
last
semester
being
a
WA
that
I
feel
will
help
me
be
a
better
WA
this
semester
than
in
my
pervious
WA
work
(not
that
I
was
bad
before!).
This
summer
I
am
working
for
a
publishing
company
(interning,
more
specifically).
I
spend
a
significant
amount
of
time
reading
and
commenting
on
submitted
manuscripts.
I
find
myself
often
applying
my
WA
experiences
to
my
work
with
these
unpublished
novels,
particularly
in
regards
to
writer
sensitivity.
I
recall
a
particular
incident
at
Lafayette
where
I
was
helping
a
drop-in
student
with
a
creative
piece
the
student
had
written
that
was
a
memoir
project.
The
student
had
written
about
a
time
in
his
life
when
he
and
his
infant
brother
were
sexually
abused
by
a
babysitter.
The
topic
was
sensitive
to
begin
with,
and
though
this
young
writerOs
heart
was
in
the
piece,
he
was
an
inexperienced
writer,
which
was
very
clear
to
me
after
reading
the
piece.
However,
as
I
tried
to
help
him
with
his
writing,
separate
the
language
from
the
content,
it
became
clear
to
me
that
this
writer
didnOt
really
want
help
because
what
he
had
written
was
too
personal
for
him
to
take
criticism.
I
often
recall
this
incident
when
I
comment
on
writerOs
work
at
my
internship.
Hearing
some
of
the
authorOs
talk
about
their
books,
or
reading
the
comments
they
send
along
with
them,
you
can
see
the
pride
they
hold
in
their
work.
Their
novels
are
like
their
children,
and
it
is
important
that
any
criticism
that
may
return
to
them
be
done
constructively,
if
it
is
to
be
useful.
Otherwise
it
will
simply
be
ignored.
Likewise,
discussing
these
novels
with
my
co-workers
and
superiors
has
helped
me
better
understand
what
makes
OgoodO
writing.
With
unpublished
texts
I
donOt
have
a
canon
to
help
me
(not
that
the
cannon
is
a
fair
means
of
judgment
which
we
debated
in
great
detail
in
my
class
the
politics
of
the
canon
I
took
in
Europe).
I
feel
I
know
posses
greater
knowledge
of
recognizing
and
separating
good
elements
from
poorly
developed
elements
of
texts
still
in
the
revising
stages.
Working
as
a
WA
helped
my
prepare
for
working
in
publishing
just
as
working
in
publishing
has
helped
me
gain
important
skills
to
better
help
me
work
as
a
WA.
When
I
approached
the
students
last
fall
I
was
scared
and
nervous.
Even
though
I
knew
they
were
freshman,
I
was
scared
that
they
would
not
respect
me
as
an
advanced
writer.
I
feared
they
would
resent
me
for
thinking
I
had
the
authority
to
help
them.
I
now
feel
much
of
this
came
from
a
lack
of
confidence
in
my
own
writing.
I
am
generally
a
B+
student
and
I
couldnOt
chase
away
the
fears
that
they
would
somehow
see
through
my
own
insecurities
as
I
wondered
a
million
banal
and
pointless
questions:
what
if
they
are
A
students?
What
if
they
write
better
than
me?
Who
am
I
to
give
them
advice?
As
the
semester
progressed
I
didnOt
feel
more
confidant
with
this
as
I
was
struggling
to
gain
responsibility
from
the
studentOs
professor.
I
felt
useless
and
ignored.
However,
this
has
all
changed.
IOve
grown
up
a
lot
in
the
past
year,
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
the
Oreal
worldO
and
I
realized
that
the
WA
program,
as
you
have
been
telling
us
all
along
is
not
about
being
a
Ogreat
writer.O
And
thus
I
have
formulated
some
advise
for
new
WAs,
the
most
important
advise
is
to
always
remember
that
you
are
not
a
professor.
You
are
not
responsible
for
teaching
these
students,
but
helping
to
the
best
of
your
ability
in
whatever
the
given
situation.
For
seniors
in
particular
we
must
remember
that
we
really
have
picked
up
a
few
things
along
these
last
three
years.
We
are
well
read,
well
educated
and
well
advised.
We
have
written
essays
weeks
in
advance
and
spent
hours
on
every
sentence
as
well
as
pounded
out
essays
only
hours
before
they
were
due.
WeOve
read
the
great
classics
and
know
what
plagiarized
writing
is.
We
know
our
grammar
rules.
We
can
help
these
students,
so
long
as
they
want
us
to.
If
they
donOt,
we
donOt
need
to
force
them
because
WAs
can
only
be
as
helpful
as
the
students
allow.
Last
year
I
put
a
lot
of
pressure
on
myself,
and
I
feel
I
focused
so
much
on
making
sure
I
did
what
I
was
supposed
to
that
I
feel
I
may
have
hindered
myself
ever
so
slightly
with
my
own
fear
of
failure.
This
year
I
am
not
scared
of
making
such
a
mistake
again.
This
year
I
am
confidant
in
myself
and
that
I
am
a
good
WA.
I
know
my
OstuffO,
and
my
communication
skills
are
much
stronger.
Listening
to
the
advise
of
other
WAs
helped
me
understand
that
the
problems
I
encountered
were
common
enough
that
I
should
not
blame
myself,
and
it
lifted
a
lot
of
worry
to
know
other
people
had
gone
through
the
same
thing.
Thus
I
encourage
new
WAs
to
approached
returning
WAs
(especially
ones
that
have
been
through
this
for
several
semesters)
if
they
have
any
problems,
as
I
know
I
will
continue
to
do.
I
encourage
new
Writing
Associates
to
take
their
job
for
what
it
is,
a
way
to
help
new
students
find
their
own
voice
as
a
writer,
as
a
guide
to
direct
new
writers
down
a
positive
path
of
growth.
