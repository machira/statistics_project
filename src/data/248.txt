Writing
Like
a
WA
On
This
Past
Year
Hi
there.
What
can
I
tell
you
this
morning
-
this
evening
-
this
something
else
-
this
time
when
you
are
reading
this.
(Oh
dear...this
is
bad
already.)
Well,
I
just
spent
the
last
hour
writing
the
beginnings
of
this
paper
-
it
was
rather
long
winded
and
I
didn't
like
it
so
I
deleted
it
and
now
you
have
this
instead.
(I'm
sorry!)
Currently,
I'm
rather
nervous
because
I
am
not
happy
with
the
number
of
times
I
used
the
word
"this"
in
the
preceding
sentences.
Oh
well.
I
know
I
can
do
better
but
this
is
the
way
I
wanted
to
start.
I
have
chosen
to
start
this
way
because
I
want
to
do
what
I
want.
I
am
the
writer
-
at
least
now
-
the
one
writing
THIS.
I
am
rather
mad
right
now
so
it
is
better
if
I
don't
think
too
much
about
my
audience.
Dear
reader,
forgive
me.
I've
lost
everything
that
was
creative
and
that
was
my
own
in
the
past
year.
I
was
stupid
and
now
I'm
brooding
over
how
stupid
I
was
and
am.
I
am
dumb.
Two
weeks
ago
my
computer
picked
up
a
virus
from
an
MP3
server
on
the
internet,
and
now,
two
weeks
later,
after
getting
a
close
(computer
literate)
friend
to
alleviate
the
disaster,
my
hard
drive
is
revamped,
and
everything
that
was
on
it
is
gone
or
is
unable
to
be
opened
by
my
current
word
processor.
All
of
my
college
writing
is
gone
-
the
past
two
years,
the
past
year,
however
you
boil
it
down
-
I
never
backed
anything
up
and
I
am
a
moron.
The
thing
that
I
had
started
writing
this
summer
-
it
was
my
new,
third
attempt
at
a
novel
-
is
now
only
in
existence
through
a
printed
copy.
A
friend
who
lives
in
Wisconsin
has
it.
I
need
to
get
it
back
from
her.
I
am
annoyed
already
by
what
I
am
telling
you,
dear
reader.
I
don't
want
to
tell
any
"readers"
anything
-
at
least
not
for
a
few
more
weeks
-but
a
deadline
is
a
deadline
and
I
must
carry
out
my
responsibilities.
I
need
to
be
honest
-
I
am
really
upset
about
losing
my
writing
files
and
since
it
is
the
one
thing
I
cannot
get
out
of
my
mind,
I
feel
it
ultimately
topical
for
this
paper.
I
am
so
upset,
I
quite
frankly
don't
think
I
should
be
writing
anything
for
a
long
time
-
I
need
to
settle
down
and
deal
with
my
loss.
Unfortunately,
because
my
computer
had
some
problems
and
I
never
thought
to
back
up
my
writings
(it
would
have
been
so
easy!),
I
have
decided
to
allow
my
limitations
to
take
center
stage
for
the
time
being.
It
is
only
fair
that
I
embarrass
myself
with
such
a
presentation
as
this.
I
await
a
corner,
so
that
I
might
sit
in
it,
facing
it,
so
that
I
might
get
a
chance
to
just
hide
for
a
while.

Hours
have
passed
in
my
life,
and
maybe
now
I
can
write
on
what
I
feel
I
should
say
to
everyone
on
the
topic
of
my
last
year
in
writing.
For
one
thing,
five
months
of
writing
time
was
spent
in
Europe,
as
I
went
to
Belgium
through
a
Lafayette-affiliated
abroad
program.
I
was
away
from
the
Writing
Associate
program
during
this
time
because
my
escorting
professor
didn't
really
have
anything
for
me
to
do
in
the
realm
of
"functions"
for
abroad
Writing
Associates.
I
was
at
first
a
little
let
down
about
not
really
having
a
formal
job
as
a
Writing
Associate
for
the
spring
semester
of
this
year,
but
Europe
quickly
got
in
the
way
of
though
patterns
like
that
-the
break
was
really
nice.
During
the
span
of
the
five
months,
I
wrote
two
research
papers
for
an
Industrial
Chemistry
class.
One
was
about
detergency,
and
the
other
dealt
with
chlorofluorocarbons.
These
research
papers,
written
in
Brussels,
came
easier
to
me
than
I
had
ever
thought
possible.
While
other
members
of
my
class
put
dozens
of
hours
into
the
two
projects,
I
really
needed
only
the
minimum
amount
of
writing
time.
I
think
it
had
to
do
entirely
with
the
fact
that
the
first
semester
of
my
sophomore
year
at
Lafayette
was
spent
as
a
Writing
Associate
-
the
entire
semester
in
Brussels
seemed
like
a
streak
of
confidence
-
I
could
do
no
wrong
when
it
came
to
writing,
because
I
had
truly
worked
with
it,
struggled
for
it,
and
helped
others
with
it.
My
grip
of
the
language
was
immense
and
I
could
type
so
much
faster
than
now
-
now,
I
can't
write
as
quickly.
We
all
need
to
keep
in
constant
practice!
I
took
an
English
class
at
the
Free
University
of
Brussels'
French-speaking
campus
-
the
class
was
still
taught
in
English,
though.
Anyway,
the
class
dealt
with
American
pastoralism
-
I
fell
in
love
with
it.
I
had
to
write
a
twenty
page
term
paper
for
the
class,
and
I
decided
to
use
three
novels
for
the
backbone
of
the
discussion:
Richard
Wright's
Native
Son,
F.
Scott
Fitzgerald's
The
Great
Gatsbv,
and
Willa
Cather's
My
Antonia
all
ended
up
in
my
arguments.
I
think
I
successfully
(and
hopefully,
interestingly)
proved
that
there
has
been
somewhat
of
a
shift
in
American
pastoralism
as
seen
through
the
three
novels
-
what
was
once
a
"pure"
traditional
pastoralism
in
our
country's
authors'
schemes
is
now
a
convoluted
pseudopastoral
nightmare.
Wait...I
already
did
this
-
for
twenty
pages.
But
it,
like
my
research
papers,
now
only
remains
in
heavily
mortal
hardcopy
form,
while
everything
in
the
world
of
further
explanation
seems
too
much
of
a
mouthful
to
tolerate.
I
don't
think
I
will
have
any
problems
writing
mature
papers
in
my
last
two
years
at
Lafayette.
Mentally,
for
even
such
an
exercise
as
this
I
can
come
up
with
decent
enough
sentences
(all
of
which
are
not
filler,
I
think,
as
I
fight
my
self-consciousness).
Even
if
my
relative
success
as
a
student
of
English
changes
for
the
worse,
I
am
happy
with
what
I
have
said
in
papers
and
with
what
I
am
saying
now.
The
future
is
not
the
issue
here,
and
the
past
seems
not
a
large
enough
reservoir
to
draw
from,
despite
the
fact
that
various
anecdotes
come
to
mind
from
my
experiences
in
helping
out
the
First
Year
Seminar
on
Jazz.
For
the
time
being,
or
the
present
time
to
clarify,
the
question
I
ask
myself
before
I
sit
down
to
write
anything
for
myself
and
not
for
school
assignment
is
hard
to
admit.
Why
write?
This
is
what
I
cannot
help
but
feel
compelled
to
ask
now.
My
question
wholly
overshadows
all
other
things
I
could
say
because
it
frightens
me
to
no
end.
Why
have
I
started
to
feel
that
working
on
a
story
isn't
worth
the
fight?
I
cannot
pull
out
of
this
spin
~
I
am
aging
into
a
life
that
is
unwriterly,
when
only
last
year
all
I
wanted
to
do
was
write.
Rilke
answered
the
question
a
long
time
ago
about
why
writers
write.
They
must
write!
I
was
a
writer,
I
cannot
be
a
writer,
I
cannot
write
now,
no!
My
demons
are
too
strong
for
now.
My
will
to
write
is
weak
-
it
cannot
overcome
my
lamentations.
I
sound
like
a
fool.
I'm
sorry.
I
hear
more
than
I
want
to
hear
now...I
cannot
function
as
a
creative
writer.
Can
I?
Sure.
Will
my
self-consciousness
fight
it
down
to
the
ground?
Yes.
Will
my
self-consciousness
cause
my
pinky
finger
to
reach
for
the
backspace
key
on
my
laptop?
Yes.
I've
probably
written
around
nine
pages
up
to
this
point
for
just
this
paper,
but
still
we
are
only
on
the
fifth
"printable"
page
-so
much
I
have
erased,
so
much
I
have
lost
that
could
not
stand
up
to
my
small
time
neurosis.
The
fears
of
my
audience
in
confusion
keep
this
from
sleeping
tight.
Oh
dear,
is
this
all
a
bad
dream?
The
funny
thing
is,
I
had
kind
of
predicted
that
all
of
this
would
happen.
Idle
fears
from
a
year
ago
have
now
come
into
being
-
existence
as
a
double
major
at
this
college
is
hard
to
swing,
and
I
don't
think
there
will
be
any
time
to
write
this
semester
unless
I
force
myself
to
submit
something
to
the
Marquis
literary
magazine.
Maybe
someone
else,
a
close
friend
perhaps,
will
help
and
force
me
to
submit
something
-
there
is
bound
to
be
someone
who
will
give
me
that
last
push
to
drop
it
off
in
the
Marquis
mailbox.
But
giving
up
my
double
major
is
out
of
the
question.
I
will
graduate
from
Lafayette
in
two
years
and
my
diploma
will
say
(in
Latin,
I
presume)
Chemical
Engineering
and
English.
Even
though
that
sounds
"so
weird."
People
ask
me
why
I
am
doing
such
an
unheard
of
double
major,
and
all
I
say
is,
"because
I
must."
Rilke's
thoughts
from
Letters
To
A
Young
Poet
have
not
left
me;
however,
they
have
redirected
themselves
to
focus
on
something
they
were
not
originally
intended
for.
On
an
unrelated
note,
one
thing
remains
steadfast:
I
love
to
digress!
I
love
to
digress
and
then
digress
back
to
what
I
had
originally
digressed
from.
This
is
one
of
my
major
faults
in
writing
--but
allow
me
to
digress
for
a
moment....
I
am
really
going
to
miss
Monette
Tiernan.
I
mention
her
name
with
great
pride,
for
I
loved
her
teaching
of
Literary
Questions
here
at
Lafayette,
yet
I
also
mention
her
name
to
admit
to
the
fear
of
forgetting
her
true
essence
in
all
of
my
current
cloudy
notions.
Before
she
left
the
school,
she
was
without
any
doubt
in
my
mind
the
most
elegant
professor
of
English
I
have
met
thus
far.
Talking
with
her
in
her
office
are
times
I
will
never
forget,
times
I
wish
I
could
have
to
relive.
I'd
love
to
write
about
King
Lear,
or
anything,
again,
with
her
behind
me,
offering
her
commentary.
But
this
is
all
too
unrealistic.
One
cannot
write
English
papers
for
their
entire
life.
Will
I
lose
the
ability
to
write
after
I
leave
the
profound
climate
that
I
am
in?
I
love
the
English
department.
Will
I
ever
be
able
to
let
it
go
and
continue?
This
word,
"assignment,"
confounds
me
to
no
end.
That
was
why
Professor
Tiernan
was
so
wonderful
-
she
did
not
think
me
crazy
when
I
handed
her
extra
papers
last
semester
when
I
did
not
want
to
do
my
engineering
homework
-
all
I
wanted
to
do
was
write
about
Shakespeare.
I
handed
in
things
on
the
side
and
she
never
questioned
me
for
using
my
time
poorly,
as
I
should
have
probably
been
crunching
numbers
for
my
Chemical
Engineering
related
classes....
What
matter.
Perry's
Chemical
Engineers'
Handbook,
all
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
of
it,
rests
comfortably
right
next
to
my
beloved
Websters'
Encyclopedic
Unabridged
Dictionary
of
the
English
Language
(all
sixty
dollars
of
that!).
My
desk
is
complemented
with
both
engineering
books
and
things
like
Animal
Farm
and
Go
Tell
It
on
the
Mountain,
which
has
been
on
my
desk
for
over
a
year,
and
I
have
still
not
picked
it
up.
I
haven't
written
anything
all
summer
and
I
feel
horrible.
I
haven't
read
anything
all
summer,
except
the
first
four
chapters
of
Roth's
Portnoy's
Complaint,
and
I
feel
horrible.
I
cannot
wait
to
be
a
Writing
Associate
again
even
if
it
breaks
my
schedule
in
two
-
it
won't.
I
won't
let
it.
I
must!
