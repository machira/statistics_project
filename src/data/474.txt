Returning
Writing
Associate
Assignment
August
15,
2005
Writing
is
an
adventure,
not
only
of
the
mind
but
also
of
the
spirit.
I
have
always
marveled
at
how
a
shift
in
perspective
or
a
variation
in
experiences
can
greatly
influence
my
personality
as
a
writer.
I
recall
at
the
end
of
last
summer,
I
was
a
morose
writer
and
a
slightly
frustrated
WA.
I
had
just
finished
WAing
an
upper
level
Economics
course,
a
class
saturated
with
seniors,
eager
to
graduate,
offhand
about
the
class
and
even
more
so
about
their
writing
assignments.
I
felt
unfulfilled
and
yet
guilty
for
not
doing
enough
to
spark
their
interest.
As
a
writer,
I
was
struggling
with
putting
anything
creative
down
on
paper.
I
felt
dried
up
and
barren
of
words
and
ideas.
The
summer
was
a
lengthy
exercise
in
boredom,
most
of
which
I
spent
being
a
couch
potato,
not
interested
in
anything,
ignoring
the
begging
blinking
light
of
my
screen,
the
accusing
face
of
Microsoft
Word
that
demanded
that
I
write
something
before
my
creative
mind
closes
and
collapses
onto
itself.
Going
to
study
abroad
in
the
fall
to
the
Netherlands
provided
the
shift
in
perspective
I
needed
to
revive
my
writing.
It
provided
a
break
from
the
sometimes
stressful
job
of
being
a
critic
of
other
peopleOs
writing.
It
gave
me
a
new
background
of
experiences,
a
new,
exotic
place
reeking
with
creative
potential,
and
English
classes
taught
from
an
entirely
new
point
of
view.
I
read
Ernest
Hemingway
for
the
first
time
and
I
liked
it.
I
was
given
assignments
of
that
were
less
demanding
yet
gave
me
a
lot
more
freedom
of
expression.
I
analyzed
the
lost
generation
in
HemingwayOs
The
Sun
Also
Rises,
compared
Gertrude
SteinOs
and
Sylvia
BeachOs
autobiographies
based
on
their
purposes
and
perceptions
of
self,
and
wrote
about
the
tortured
soul
of
Van
Gogh
that
screamed
out
through
his
intense,
sometimes
twisted
paintings.
I
discovered
a
whole
new
repertoire
of
Modern
writers,
a
whole
new
movement
in
literature
which
I
had
somehow
missed
during
my
twenty-one
years
as
a
writer
and
literary
fanatic.
The
idea
that
I
wanted
to
approach
my
senior
year
thesis
as
an
entirely
creative
venture
started
to
germinate
in
my
head.
While
my
academic
writing
had
started
to
flourish,
I
was
also
rediscovering
my
imaginative
creativity.
Europe
provided
an
amazing
backdrop
for
the
birth
of
ideas
and
the
flow
of
words.
The
quaint,
old-world
cafOs,
the
parks,
the
narrow,
cobble-stoned
streets
infested
with
bicycles
and
culture
were
the
perfect
writerOs
retreat.
My
travels,
the
people
I
met,
the
overindulgences,
the
taking
off
on
a
momentOs
whim,
the
colorful
European
countryside,
the
eccentricities
and
uniqueness
of
every
person,
that
differed
as
much
as
the
florid
languages
they
spoke,
were
all
recorded
like
vivid
snapshots
in
my
writerOs
notebook,
like
scenes
out
of
a
wacky
travelogue.
December
rolled
around
way
too
soon
and
I
left
Europe
behind,
leaping
across
the
Atlantic
in
one
swoop,
and
it
became
a
memory,
a
lingering
aftertaste
of
good
times,
but
I
had
been
rejuvenated.
I
felt
like
a
new
person
and
when
I
resumed
my
WA
job,
I
went
out
there
with
all
guns
blazing.
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
discover
that
I
had
been
assigned
a
VAST
course
D
and
not
one
having
to
do
with
my
primary
major,
Economics.
I
was
happy
not
to
have
to
deal
with
any
more
senioritis-stricken
pre-graduates.
This
time
I
was
going
to
have
sophomores,
young
writers
still
in
a
developmental
stage,
and
I
will
no
longer
have
to
read
papers
about
money
markets,
and
banking
institutions
D
I
had
quite
enough
of
that
in
my
own
upper
level
Economics
courses.
Thus,
I
was
quite
excited
to
have
a
VAST
course
that
dealt
with
property
theft
and
where
the
papers
I
read
largely
consisted
of
the
exhibition
of
property
issues
in
popular
movies,
most
of
which
I
had
seen
and
liked.
Fun
as
it
was
to
read
these
papers,
I
faced
other
issues
as
a
WA,
which
I
had
not
anticipated.
My
professor
was
one
of
the
friendliest
and
most
cooperative
I
had
ever
had,
however,
her
ignorance
of
the
purposes
of
the
college
writing
program
and
my
function
as
a
WA
impeded
me
at
some
turns.
She
was
a
Math
professor,
teaching
a
VAST
for
the
first
time,
and
I
was
her
first
brush
with
the
esteemed
English
department
at
Lafayette.
My
first
apprehension
came
when
during
our
first
meeting,
she
told
me,
up-front
that
the
advice
she
gives
the
students
about
their
papers,
as
a
Math
professor
desirous
of
conciseness
might
directly
conflict
with
my
suggestions
as
a
wordy
English
major
and
an
advocate
of
flash
and
flamboyance
in
writing.
I
prepared
myself
to
adjust
my
strategy
according
to
her
desire
for
NconcisenessO.
I
wasnOt
really
a
spring
chicken
at
this;
I
had
WAed
Economics
classes
before,
I
was
an
Economics
major.
I
had
been
the
protg
of
Professor
Gamber;
I
had
been
his
WA
two
semesters
ago,
Professor
Gamber
who
liked
not
accepted
any
sentence
more
than
eight
words
long,
and
did
not
read
any
papers
who
went
a
word
above
the
barest
of
bones.
However,
I
did
not
anticipate
the
next
curve
ball
my
current
professor
threw
me.
It
hit
me
square
in
the
eye
sometime
around
the
second
round
of
WA
meetings
I
had.
It
became
apparent
to
me
that
my
students
seemed
a
little
disinterested
in
what
I
had
to
say,
that
they
seemed
slightly
impatient
and
fidgety
during
meetings,
and
that
my
suggestions
were
heard
but
obviously
not
absorbed.
They
missed
meetings
left
and
right,
and
some
of
them
even
flatly
told
me
that
they
did
not
need
to
meet
with
me
since
they
knew
exactly
what
they
had
to
do
with
their
papers
and
did
not
need
my
help.
I
was
confused,
frustrated
and
very
annoyed
until
I
found
out
that
the
professor
had
been
scheduling
meetings
with
the
students
the
week
before
I
was
to
meet
with
them
and
giving
them
very
specific
instructions
about
how
to
improve
their
papers.
It
suddenly
seemed
painfully
obvious
how
I
and
my
painstaking
reading
and
reviewing
of
the
papers
had
become
expendable.
I
suppose
here
was
where
the
NcontradictionO
she
had
mentioned
reared
its
head.
However,
like
in
any
of
the
classes
I
have
had
so
far,
the
student
pool
was
diverse
in
its
appreciation
of
the
WA
program.
Moreover,
I
found
that
the
professor
was
gratifyingly
cooperative
and
understanding
once
I
talked
to
her,
and
also
very
attentive
of
my
evaluation
of
the
papers,
which
she
asked
me
for
every
time
we
had
a
meeting
after
a
round
of
WA
conferences.
Probably
the
best
lesson
I
learned
during
this
semester,
one
that
came
after
many
disgruntled
emails
and
annoyed
phone
calls,
was
that
sometimes
you
just
have
to
give
up
on
a
student.
I
may
do
my
best
but
I
cannot
force
anyone
to
be
interested
in
my
comments
or
mindful
or
respectful
of
my
function.
One
of
my
students
this
semester
taught
me
that,
perhaps
the
most
egotistical
and
self-confident
student
I
have
ever
had.
I
suppose
I
understood
the
reasons
behind
this
overabundance
of
self-belief;
after
reading
his
papers
I
certainly
saw
the
justification
for
this
stubborn
conviction
in
his
own
writing
talent,
respected
it
almost.
His
papers
were
easily
the
best
in
the
batch,
solid
and
effortless
and
yet
strong
enough
to
leave
the
reader
reeling.
The
best
thing
about
his
papers,
which
I
found
lacking
in
almost
all
the
other
papers
I
read,
was
that
seamlessness
that
only
comes
when
the
writing
flows
freely
without
any
obvious
adherence
to
literary
conventions.
He
wrote
with
force
and
passion,
and
yet
with
tight
structure
and
form,
rather
than
with
the
painstaking
listlessness
which
makes
so
many
papers
such
a
yawn,
stringently
and
tastelessly
constructed.
Yet,
I
could
not
quite
bring
myself
to
completely
condone
the
disrespect
he
showed
me,
missing
conferences
without
fail,
without
notice,
repeating
this
every
time
I
managed
to
get
hold
of
him
to
reschedule.
The
professorOs
threats
did
not
work,
neither
did
my
harassment.
Finally,
we
both
decided
to
mutually
give
him
up
for
lost.
And
I
discovered
that
stalking
unresponsive
students
sometimes
doesnOt
work
and
it
does
not
have
to
be
my
fault.
I
managed
to
conquer
my
greatest
roadblock
as
a
WA;
i.e.
this
unflagging
guilt
that
stays
with
me
every
time
I
feel
that
I
am
unable
to
fulfill
my
duties
and
help
someone
to
the
maximum
that
I
could.
I
learned
to
feel
content
with
giving
it
my
best
shot,
and
learned
not
to
feel
responsible
when
I
fail
due
to
circumstances
and
attitudes
that
are
beyond
my
control.
The
semester,
however,
also
produced
students
who
make
the
WA
job
worthwhile.
After
putting
in
some
serious
hours
reading
and
evaluating
student
papers,
it
is
always
gratifying
to
be
recognized.
The
semester
also
produced
a
couple
of
students
who
came
prepared
with
a
list
of
questions
to
ask
me
and
who
asked
me
for
help
in
very
specific
areas.
And
at
the
end
of
a
semester,
though
you
do
not
ask
for
it,
it
is
always
good
to
get
that
token
of
appreciation
when
a
student
explicitly
tells
you
how
much
you
helped
him
and
his
writing.
This
semester,
through
my
very
diverse
writers
with
their
variegated
attitudes,
I
also
learned
how
it
does
not
always
work
to
adhere
to
a
specific
formula
when
it
comes
to
approaching
and
organizing
a
conference.
The
greatest
debate
which
was
sparked
in
the
process
of
staff
meetings
was
whether
it
is
a
good
idea
or
not
to
make
comments
on
the
student
papers.
It
was
suggested
and
widely
agreed
that
perhaps
this
is
not
such
a
good
strategy
since
the
students
do
not
tend
to
listen
as
closely
and
respond
interactively
when
the
comments
are
written
down
for
them.
However,
I
discovered
that
since
this
may
be
workable
advice
in
some
cases,
it
might
not
be
in
others.
I
observed
that
in
some
cases,
handing
back
a
pristine
paper
sometimes
leads
to
loss
of
trust,
where
the
student
believes
that
I
did
not
take
out
the
time
to
thoroughly
read
their
paper.
Heavy
handwriting
appears
to
give
some
students
confidence
in
their
WA
and
her
commitment,
while
for
some
students,
it
encourages
them
to
write
down
my
comments
themselves
in
their
own
words,
which,
of
course,
is
more
productive.
I
found
out
what
a
mixed
bag
conferences
can
be
and
how
sometimes
it
is
better
to
just
improvise
and
of
course,
to
get
to
know
your
students
and
their
writerOs
psychologies.
After
a
round
of
conferences,
the
students
automatically
become
differentiated
in
my
mind,
and
I
approach
the
conferences
accordingly.
And
I
suppose
this
contrastive
student
body
is
part
of
what
makes
the
WA
job
interesting
and
challenging.
The
semester
ended
successfully,
as
a
writer
and
as
a
WA.
I
decided
that
I
was
going
to
go
for
the
creative
thesis
and
take
a
chance
on
myself
as
a
writer.
Since
it
is
my
senior
year,
this
year
promises
a
bittersweet
beginning.
Though
there
is
a
strong
possibility
that
I
am
once
again
going
to
be
WAing
an
upper
level
Economics
course,
this
time
I
am
going
into
it
with
a
more
positive
attitude
and
a
fresher
outlook.
And
senior
writers
will
not
feel
like
such
formidable
opposition
anymore,
since
this
year,
I
myself
am
a
part
of
that
pool.
I
anticipate
that
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
my
own
classmates
have
progressed
in
their
college
writing
over
our
three
turbulent
years
and
how
this
compares
to
my
own
sometimes
shaky
but
overall
satisfying
progress.
The
WA
job
has
been
a
significant
contributor
to
my
decision
to
apply
for
a
Ph.D.
in
English
right
out
of
college.
I
feel
that
I
have
come
a
long
way,
as
a
writer
and
as
a
WA
and
look
forward
to
a
creatively
fulfilling
year,
before
I
start
a
new
intense
phase
as
a
graduate
writer
and
take
my
love
for
writing
and
the
English
language
to
the
next
level.
