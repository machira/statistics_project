Writing
on
the
Walls
By
L.
DeWitt
I
like
to
think
if
you
rounded
up
my
friends,
family,
professors,
bosses,
and
acquaintances,
they
would
all
agree
on
one
fact:
that
IOm
a
much
better
writer
than
speaker.
IOve
become
a
bit
more
outspoken
in
recent
years,
but
since
I
can
remember,
IOve
been
captivated
by
words.
Writing
has
been
both
an
inspiration
and
a
form
of
rebellion
to
me.
I
learned
to
read
and
write
early
on
in
life.
My
first
instance
of
writing
was
crafting
a
letter
for
my
dad
at
the
age
of
4
because
I
didnOt
approve
of
his
treatment
of
my
mother.
Sadly
I
donOt
remember
the
contents
of
the
letter,
but
I
know
a
significant
amount
of
it
was
detailing
how
upset
I
was
with
my
dad
and
what
I
thought
he
should
to
do
improve
our
situation.
At
the
very
least,
I
know
that
my
words
left
everyone
less
than
thrilled.
Though
my
actions
led
to
being
grounded
and
spending
most
of
my
summer
with
my
grandparents,
it
taught
me
something
that
everyone
should
learn
at
a
very
young
age;
words
have
power
and
you
need
to
be
very
careful
with
choosing
them.
Initially,
I
enjoyed
reading
words
instead
of
writing
them.
I
never
attended
kindergarten,
but
I
went
straight
to
first
grade
and
read
all
the
books
up
to
the
5th
grade
level
(or
so
they
tell
me).
Nowadays,
I
think
that
Little
Women
and
The
American
Girl
Series
are
my
favorite
books
from
first
grade.
My
experiences
with
writing
in
elementary
school
were
different
in
the
fact
that
I
always
saw
writing
as
choice,
instead
of
the
leisure
that
reading
was.
Writing
was
all
about
cursive,
grammar,
and
form,
which
meant
figuring
out
the
different
rules
of
grammar,
using
word
combinations,
making
the
transition
from
straight-edged
letters
to
loopy
ones,
and
so
on.
It
got
even
worse
in
3rd
grade
when
we
had
to
start
using
pens
instead
of
pencils
and
my
first
thought
was
Nhow
am
I
ever
going
to
get
rid
of
these
smudges?O
Thankfully
my
grandmother
was
a
teacher
and
would
absolutely
not
accept
failure,
so
I
kept
at
it,
practicing
when
I
was
home,
and
eventually,
like
all
students,
I
mastered
the
art
of
cursive.
In
6th
grade,
I
attended
a
private
school,
which
immediately
introduced
me
to
the
world
of
the
computer.
I
think
I
fell
in
love
with
it
so
quickly
mainly
because
I
wasnOt
that
big
a
fan
of
my
penmanship.
It
took
a
while
to
get
to
the
point
where
my
typing
was
as
fast
as
my
handwriting,
but
IOm
glad
I
got
the
experience
early
on,
because
itOs
become
an
invaluable
skill.
Middle
school
was
also
when
I
began
learning
rhetorical
strategies
and
conducting
research
assignments.
While
my
first
research
paper
was
about
a
relatively
simple
topic
(bees
and
their
environment),
my
teachers
did
not
go
lightly
on
us.
We
spent
days
in
the
library,
collected
sources
from
audiobooks,
websites,
magazines,
etc.,
and
had
specific
instructions
on
the
dangers
of
plagiarism
and
sourcing.
Surprising
as
it
may
sound,
I
enjoyed
my
first
research
paper
a
lot.
It
was
on
a
topic
that
I
had
been
very
interested
in,
and
it
helped
me
transition
from
thinking
of
writing
as
a
way
of
putting
down
my
thoughts
sporadically,
into
realizing
that
it
also
entailed
strategizing,
researching,
and
building
off
of
itself
by
using
sources
to
either
elevate
or
deconstruct
your
ideas.
Even
though
I
gained
an
appreciation
for
research,
I
was
thankful
that
we
were
able
to
cover
other
topics
in
middle
school,
especially
learning
about
poetry
and
short
stories.
My
brother
will
always
be
the
great
poet
within
our
family,
but
I
did
learn
a
lot
about
rhythm
and
rhyme,
which
is
helpful
for
both
poetry
and
longer
works.
It
helped
me
to
focus
on
making
my
writing
flow
like
a
river
(you
can
also
tell
this
is
when
I
learned
about
similes
and
metaphors
as
well)
instead
of
it
being
erratic
and
jumbled.
I
remember
one
of
my
teachers
telling
me
Nyour
poetry
is
very
nice
and
you
convey
emotions
well,
but
thereOs
no
structure.
You
canOt
always
write
in
free
verse
you
know?O
That
was
one
of
the
earliest
major
criticisms
about
my
writing
that
I
remember,
and
after
that,
I
started
treating
my
poetry
like
my
grammar
classes
and
practicing
them
over
and
over.
Soon
enough,
I
was
gaining
a
better
understanding
of
the
complexities
of
poetry,
and
getting
positive
feedback
from
my
teachers.
My
interest
in
poetry
didnOt
stop
at
the
academic
level,
as
I
remember
spending
most
of
my
summers
and
weekends
during
the
school
year
writing
poetry.
Sometimes
I
would
write
about
riding
home
on
the
bus
and
seeing
the
sunset,
spending
time
with
my
friends,
a
particularly
tasty
dish
that
my
grandmother
made,
and
whatever
else
I
was
feeling
at
the
time.
I
also
started
writing
songs.
I
never
put
them
to
an
official
instrument,
but
I
had
tunes
and
lyrics
for
almost
every
situation.
Even
now,
I
like
to
think
that
writing
was
one
of
the
best
hobbies
I
took
up
in
middle
school,
because
at
that
age,
youOre
always
bursting
with
emotions
but
unable
to
express
them
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
Whether
my
writing
at
the
time
was
good
or
bad,
angry
or
joyful,
it
was
mine.
And
sometimes,
you
need
something
thatOs
yours
and
only
yours.
For
me,
it
was
words.
By
the
time
I
entered
high
school,
I
was
moving
purely
into
the
world
of
logic,
literary
criticism,
and
case
studies.
Looking
back,
I
now
consider
10th
grade
to
be
the
time
when
I
started
strengthening
my
writing
and
preparing
it
for
a
college
level.
I
say
this
because
on
October
16th,
2007
I
took
my
first
logic
test.
IOll
never
forget
the
date;
because
as
dramatic
as
it
sounds,
it
was
the
first
time
I
ever
received
a
low
grade
on
an
English
test.
Roughly
half
the
class
and
I
were
attending
my
teacherOs
office
hours
almost
daily
and
trying
to
figure
out
what
we
had
done
wrong.
The
hardest
part
was
realizing
that
it
wasnOt
specifically
about
what
I
had
done
right
or
wrong,
itOs
that
my
arguments
were
poor
and
my
comments
came
across
jumbled
and
nonsensical.
My
teacher
gave
us
a
small
book
similar
to
St.
MartinOs,
and
we
wrote
papers
using
different
rhetorical
strategies
the
throughout
the
year.
It
started
out
being
tedious
and
frustrating,
but
it
compelled
me
to
think
critically,
which
was
one
of
the
most
important
skills
I
learned
throughout
high
school.
My
English
classes
also
spent
time
teaching
us
to
proofread
and
edit
each
otherOs
papers,
which
I
used
later
on
to
help
my
brother
and
his
friends
both
in
high
school
and
later
college.
I
also
have
to
give
credit
to
my
history
classes
as
well,
as
most
of
the
work
we
did
throughout
the
year
consisted
of
mini
and
larger
project
research
paper.
My
history
papers
also
made
me
think
of
the
importance
of
accuracy
and
research
when
writing
a
paper
based
on
historical
events,
because
no
matter
what
your
argument
is,
you
cannot
change
the
actual
history,
but
you
can
find
different
perspectives
about
it.
Another
way
that
my
high
school
English
and
history
classes
affected
my
writing
is
by
moving
me
from
poetry
writing
to
short
stories.
While
I
canOt
remember
showing
any
of
my
family
members
my
personal
works,
they
know
that
thereOs
nothing
I
love
more
than
writing
or
telling
a
good
story.
I
enjoy
characters
more
than
plot,
so
many
of
my
stories
are
character-driven
and
deal
with
situations
both
familiar
and
distant
to
me.
For
example,
what
does
it
feel
like
to
leave
the
U.S.
and
attend
school
in
a
different
country?
What
is
it
like
to
be
homeschooled
up
until
college?
How
does
one
survive
without
Internet
for
a
month?
Some
of
my
topics
were
sillier
than
others,
but
as
a
minority,
a
female,
and
just
a
person
with
a
slew
of
problems
like
everyone
else,
it
felt
freeing
to
research
the
culture
and
lives
of
others
to
create
my
own
stories.
By
writing
at
home
and
at
school,
I
made
language
both
a
skill
and
my
own
personal
hobby,
which
I
think
helped
me
differentiate
between
formal
and
informal
writing,
which
I
think
helped
me
just
in
time
for
college.
My
freshman
year
was
interesting
for
a
lot
of
reasons,
but
in
terms
of
academic
writing,
everything
seemed
relatively
stable.
I
enjoyed
my
FYS
and
my
English
classes,
and
the
few
times
where
I
had
to
write
a
paper
in
economics.
My
FYS
professor
and
my
WA
were
especially
helpful,
and
my
first
WA
was
the
one
who
got
me
interested
in
the
CWP
from
the
start,
even
thought
I
declined
to
apply
my
freshman
year
because
health
issues
and
grades.
I
always
imagined
writing
classes
to
be
relatively
straightforward
with
reading
multiple
literacy
classics
and
attempting
to
find
the
inner
meaning
behind
all
of
them,
so
I
appreciated
the
FYS
program
which
allowed
us
to
select
from
a
variety
of
programs
and
learn
about
a
topic
that
we
might
not
get
to
experience
anywhere
else.
Though
I
didnOt
have
to
take
college
writing,
my
writing
style
in
college
improved
significantly
not
just
through
my
different
courses,
but
the
variety
of
people
I
was
meeting.
Meeting
people
from
different
countries,
states,
ethnicities,
religions,
etc.
was
amazing
because
it
helped
me
question
how
many
assumptions
I
came
into
college
with,
and
also
what
could
I
bring
to
the
Lafayette
student
body.
This
was
also
the
first
time
I
stopped
writing
altogether
outside
of
an
academic
setting
since
middle
school.
I
think
it
was
equal
parts
stress,
family
issues,
and
a
general
sense
of
loss
that
occurred
by
coming
to
college
that
gave
me
my
writerOs
block.
It
was
an
awful
feeling,
and
I
spent
the
entire
year
feeling
NstuckO
internally.
I
knew
what
I
needed
to
do,
but
I
had
lost
all
of
my
drive
and
ambition
to
do
so.
Over
the
summer,
I
decided
that
giving
up
my
writing
and
moping
around
wouldnOt
serve
any
purpose,
and
instead
of
trying
to
create
stories,
I
went
back
to
my
middle
school
roots
and
kept
a
journal.
I
wrote
about
college,
the
friends
I
made
D
both
good
and
bad,
my
career
and
academic
goals,
being
home
again,
and
why
I
wanted
to
go
to
Lafayette
in
the
first
place.
Even
though
it
was
a
departure
from
my
usual
writing,
it
helped
me
to
figure
out
exactly
what
I
wanted
and
what
I
was
lacking.
This
time,
I
made
sure
that
whatever
I
wrote,
I
also
shared
with
my
grandmother
as
a
way
of
talking
out
what
was
going
on.
It
was
therapeutic,
and
prepared
me
amazingly
to
deal
with
both
the
social
and
academic
aspects
of
my
sophomore
year.
Now
that
IOm
moving
into
my
junior
year,
I
like
to
think
my
time
as
a
sophomore
was
more
of
an
adjustment
period
in
which
I
learned
to
deal
with
myself
and
those
around
me.
As
a
sophomore,
I
wrote
about
religion,
culture,
history,
sexism,
technology,
and
race.
I
thought
about
these
topics
both
in
my
writing
and
lecture
classes,
while
also
writing
about
them
in
my
spare
time
in
order
to
see
how
I
felt
about
these
topics
versus
what
my
classmates
and
professors
felt.
It
encouraged
me
to
feel
more
engaged
in
my
studies,
and
made
the
issues
I
was
studying
feel
relevant
to
my
peers
and
myself.
My
favorite
parts
of
sophomore
year
were
writing
on
different
technological
issues
during
my
VAST,
and
finally
getting
to
write
a
economics
paper
in
my
Econometrics
class.
While
my
skills
tend
to
lean
toward
writing
over
mathematics,
I
have
been
fascinated
by
economics
and
its
inner
workings
since
freshman
year.
But
IOve
always
wondered
what
it
might
be
like
to
put
all
of
those
mathematical
theories
and
equations
in
a
research
paper,
and
while
it
was
one
of
the
most
challenging
papers
IOve
written,
it
was
incredibly
rewarding
to
see
both
the
data
and
my
interpretation
mesh
together.
My
newest
goal
is
to
eventually
perfect
my
writing
in
the
natural
sciences,
as
I
still
need
to
familiarize
myself
with
some
of
the
terms
and
formats
that
go
into
writing
for
the
health
professions,
as
I
would
like
to
join
the
healthcare
industry
at
some
point
in
my
future.
I
also
decided
to
do
a
new
trick
in
order
to
cheer
myself
up:
I
put
up
poems
and
stories
by
some
of
my
favorite
authors
(and
a
story
or
two
that
I
wrote
myself).
The
wall
about
my
bed
looked
like
an
absolute
mess,
but
it
was
definitely
worth
it.
Overall,
I
believe
that
my
journey
as
writer
has
affected
my
journey
as
a
person:
as
I
learned
more
about
the
world
and
dealt
with
my
own
situation,
my
writing
changed
along
with
me.
I
still
have
a
ways
to
go
as
a
writer
and
a
person,
but
IOve
improved
a
lot
both
by
getting
feedback
from
my
professors,
family,
and
friends,
and
also
observing
the
change
in
my
work
on
my
own.
As
a
Writing
Associate,
I
hope
to
give
others
the
opportunity
to
grow
from
their
writing,
just
as
I
did.
