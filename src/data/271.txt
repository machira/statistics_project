Literacy
Narrative
Fall
2000
Over
the
past
year,
my
writing
experiences
have
been
diverse
with
progress
and
frustration
coming
in
equally
maddening
doses.
While
I
have
grown
extensively
as
a
writer,
progress
is
a
mixed
blessing,
as
writing
becomes
a
more
difficult
process
as
I
raise
my
personal
expectations.
As
well,
the
simple
five
and
ten
page
papers
of
Freshman
and
Sophomore
year
have
given
way
to
more
substantive
work
such
as
twenty
page
papers,
intensive
Excel
research,
and
the
beginnings
of
a
thesis.
These
struggles
have
been
amplified
by
the
feeling
that
I
am
alone
as
I
do
my
writing,
as
peer
reading
has
become
nearly
non-existent.
Only
occasionally
do
I
bother
others
with
reading
over
my
long
and
narrowly
focused
papers,
as
my
papers
are
often
as
much
of
a
chore
to
read
as
they
are
to
write.
I
find
that
during
the
writing
process,
the
bulk
of
interaction
I
have
with
peers
takes
place
while
I
formulate
ideas,
and
once
the
writing
process
begins,
I
am
alone,
usually
early
in
the
morning
with
an
ample
supply
of
coffee
or
Mountain
Dew.
Thus,
over
the
last
year,
although
it
has
been
a
difficult
process,
I
feel
that
I
have
made
great
strides
as
a
writer,
and
that
work
has
made
being
a
Writing
Associate
a
much
more
rewarding
experience.
Last
fall,
I
spent
the
semester
in
Washington,
D.C.,
and
while
I
did
not
do
a
tremendous
amount
of
writing,
the
work
I
did
was
eclectic
and
useful
for
future
use.
For
instance,
because
I
needed
to
get
an
internship,
I
had
to
make
myself
a
resume,
the
one
piece
of
writing
in
which
proof
reading
is
most
essential,
as
only
one
typo
will
almost
guarantee
a
person
not
getting
a
job.
As
well,
my
proof
reading
and
writing
skills
were
put
to
use
at
my
internship
at
Amnesty
International,
where
I
worked
in
the
media
department.
I
was
frequently
asked
to
read
or
even
draft
press
releases
on
short
notice,
and
where
accuracy
was
an
absolute
necessity.
These
press
releases,
like
my
resume,
were
written
in
simple
language,
yet
the
process
of
writing
and
proof
reading
them
helped
me
improve
my
eye
for
simple
mistakes
that
is
a
necessary
skill
for
being
a
Writing
Associate.
While
in
Washington,
I
also
took
a
foreign
policy
seminar,
in
which
I
wrote
several
three
to
five
page
papers.
My
professor
in
this
seminar,
himself
a
former
foreign
policy
officer,
gave
us
writing
assignments
in
the
form
of
foreign
policy
memos.
My
professor,
by
assigning
these
memos,
challenged
us
to
write
in
as
concise
a
way
as
possible,
as
the
point
of
such
memos
is
to
pack
as
many
coherent
ideas
into
as
few
words
as
possible.
Thus,
although
I
did
not
do
a
great
deal
of
writing
in
terms
of
page
numbers
in
this
seminar,
I
honed
a
very
important
skill,
writing
with
density
of
language.
In
much
of
my
previous
work
at
Lafayette,
I
had
relied
on
the
verbosity
of
my
language,
as
I
knew
that
professors
actually
encouraged
such
a
dynamic
writing
style.
After
handing
in
the
first
of
these
memos,
I
received
it
back
with
a
B,
a
grade
that
I
had
not
exactly
expected.
Upon
conference
with
the
professor,
he
told
me
that
while
my
ideas
were
good,
my
writing
was
too
wordy,
and
slightly
opaque.
After
he
better
described
to
me
his
expectations
for
such
memos,
I
adjusted,
and
my
subsequent
memos
were
met
with
great
approval
by
him,
and
greater
self-satisfaction.
After
awhile,
I
found
these
memos
to
be
a
great
challenge,
as
it
challenged
me
to
do
as
much
with
as
few
words
as
possible,
thus
forcing
me
to
use
vivid
language
and
express
my
ideas
in
creative
ways,
often
using
metaphors
and
other
such
language
devices.
Upon
returning
to
Lafayette
for
the
spring
semester,
a
readjustment
was
definitely
in
order.
For
the
first
time
at
Lafayette,
I
did
not
have
a
math
or
science
class,
so
with
the
exception
of
a
handful
of
small
tests,
all
my
writing
assignments
were
writing
assignments.
As
well,
I
was
taking
two
300
level
classes
and
two
upper
200
level
classes,
so
the
expectations
of
the
professors
I
had
were
higher
as
my
classmates
were
most
often
majors
in
the
particular
field
of
the
class.
Finally,
the
length
of
the
papers
was
an
adjustment,
as
no
writing
assignment
I
had
was
less
than
seven
pages
the
entire
semester.
One
endeavor
that
indirectly
helped
me
in
my
writing
was
living
in
the
McKelvy
House.
At
the
McKelvy
House,
we
had
biweekly
meetings
at
which
the
twenty
students
who
lived
there
had
a
discussion
on
a
particular
topic.
During
these
discussions,
since
there
are
so
many
other
intelligent
students
in
the
discussion,
it
is
a
necessity
to
come
up
with
a
logical,
well
informed
thought
before
speaking,
or
one
risks
being
the
victim
of
an
embarrassing
rebuke.
At
these
discussions,
substance
of
thought
and
articulation
played
equal
parts
in
any
useful
comment,
a
lesson
that
bode
well
for
the
writing
I
did
during
the
semester.
During
the
semester,
the
major
problem
that
I
encountered
when
I
wrote
was
procrastination.
Invariably,
all
my
writing
assignments
were
due
on
Monday,
and
because
I
put
things
off
the
last
minute,
I
would
not
start
until
Sunday
evening,
after
watching
basketball
all
afternoon,
eating
dinner,
and
watching
the
Simpsons
at
8:00.
When
I
started
these
papers
at
8:30
on
Sunday
evening,
more
often
that
not,
I
had
a
basic
idea
what
I
wanted
to
write
about,
and
by
9:00,1
would
realize
that
I
could
not
possibly
write
about
what
I
had
in
mind.
Upon
changing
the
scope
of
my
writing,
I
usually
paced
around
my
room
and
adjacent
hallway
for
another
hour,
throwing
ideas
around,
at
which
time,
I
would
go
to
Wawa
to
get
the
amount
of
caffeine
that
I
deemed
necessary
to
complete
the
assignment.
Finally,
at
around
10:30,1
would
truly
begin
writing,
and
thanks
to
my
equally
nocturnal
roommate,
I
was
able
to
finish
these
papers
at
about
5:00
am,
so
that
I
get
the
necessary
three
hours
of
sleep
to
make
my
9:00
class
and
not
fall
asleep
in
class.
Aside
from
unresolved
debate
on
the
merits
of
black
coffee
vs.
Mountain
Dew,
what
else
did
I
learn
from
these
intensive
writing
sessions?
One
lesson
that
I
learned
is
that
the
most
important
aspect
of
good
writing
is
a
logical
progression
of
ideas,
the
"thinking"
that
goes
into
writing.
While
I
joked
before
about
how
I
changed
my
paper
topic
at
10:00
pm
the
night
before
starting
my
assignment,
I
know
in
the
back
of
my
mind
that
I
had
been
thinking
about
my
assignment
long
before
I
sat
down
to
write.
So
much
of
the
actual
writing
process,
local
WA
concerns
such
as
language
and
grammar,
seem
to
actually
come
easier
to
me
when
I
write
under
a
great
time
pressure
constraint.
More
global
concerns,
such
as
thesis
development
and
structure,
have
become
so
internalized
in
my
writing
process
that
to
me,
they
do
not
even
seem
to
be
part
of
the
writing
process
that
I
used
to
struggle
with
earlier
in
my
academic
career.
Thus,
it
seems
my
writing
has
elevated
to
a
different
level,
in
which
thesis
development
and
structure
are
an
ongoing
process
from
the
time
the
professor
hands
out
the
assignment.
Another
change
that
I
noticed
about
my
own
writing
is
I
have
started
to
take
pride
in
my
writing
for
reasons
other
than
academic
achievement.
When
I
handed
in
papers
this
spring,
I
considered
them
complete,
and
I
often
merely
glanced
at
my
professor's
comments
upon
return.
While
this
may
seem
to
be
reek
of
overconfidence
(it
is,
I
know)
the
point
is
that
while
I
know
I
am
still
writing
to
a
particular
audience
(my
professor),
the
writing
process
has
become
a
much
more
personal
process.
This
evolution
of
the
nature
of
my
writing
hit
home
this
summer,
as
I
have
done
a
great
deal
of
writing
for
the
Excel
research.
At
first,
I
thought
that
the
nature
of
such
work,
done
for
a
professor
of
government
of
law,
would
be
more
demanding
than
normal
schoolwork
as
I
would
have
to
meet
the
high
level
set
forth
by
the
professor
with
whom
I
am
working.
The
work
I
have
done,
short
article
summaries
and
slightly
longer
biographies
of
lawyers,
has
been
demanding,
but
not
so
much
because
of
pressure
put
on
me
by
the
professor.
In
fact,
my
professor
has
been
extremely
hands-off,
and
I
have
met
with
him
on
only
a
handful
of
occasions.
The
work
has
been
demanding
because
I
am
not
being
evaluated
by
grades,
and
the
main
audience
I
have
to
satisfy
is
myself.
And
it
seems
that
recently,
especially
in
terms
of
writing,
I
have
become
my
own
most
difficult
critic.
Every
time
that
I
write,
I
try
to
surpass
the
last
work
I
did
in
terms
of
content
and
style,
which
of
course
is
nearly
impossible.
Thus
writing
recently
has
become
frustrating,
as
I
struggle
to
continue
making
progress,
while
realizing
that
every
good
paper
I
write
means
the
next
I
write
must
be
that
much
better.
Compounding
my
problem
(?)
is
the
fact
that
I
have
started
to
do
independent
research,
which
is
going
to
become
a
senior
year
thesis.
When
I
was
a
freshman,
if
somebody
had
told
me
that
I
would
be
writing
a
100-page
paper
when
I
was
a
senior,
I
would
laughed
them
off.
Now
that
I
am
about
to
embark
on
the
writing,
while
a
thesis
is
certainly
the
most
difficult
piece
of
writing
that
I
have
ever
attempted,
I
feel
confident
that
I
will
be
able
to
do
it,
and
do
it
well.
The
writing
progress
that
I
have
made
at
Lafayette,
based
on
the
writing
classes
I
have
taken,
and
augmented
by
being
a
WA
has
helped
get
to
the
point
where
I
am
actually
looking
forward
to
the
challenge
of
a
thesis.
Speaking
of
being
a
WA,
the
past
year
was
a
fairly
unremarkable
year
for
me
in
that
regard.
Upon
returning
during
the
spring
semester,
I
was
assigned
to
a
phantom
class
and
spent
the
semester
helping
out
students
mainly
through
the
drop-in
service
and
recommendations
from
professors.
Some
of
these
meetings
were
productive,
especially
meetings
with
two
students
who
were
completing
theses,
as
reading
their
work
will
help
me
in
the
future.
Unfortunately,
however,
the
meetings
I
had
during
the
spring
semester
lacked
the
breadth
of
normal
WA'ing.
Every
person
who
I
met
with
during
the
semester
had
a
particular
concern
that
they
brought
to
me,
so
I
did
not
have
to
deal
with
the
typical
Lafayette
student,
interested
only
getting
through
the
meeting,
not
concerned
with
what
the
WA
has
to
say.
While
it
was
nice
to
deal
with
such
enthusiastic
students,
it
is
not
the
reality
of
being
a
WA,
and
having
an
FYS
to
attend
to
will
undoubtedly
bring
me
to
WA
reality.
All
kidding
aside,
my
experiences
over
the
past
year
have
demonstrated
how
valuable
being
a
WA
has
been
for
my
own
writing.
I
remember
in
one
of
the
conferences
I
had
this
year,
I
was
trying
to
explain
to
a
student
that
her
writing
lacked
a
certain
"flow".
When
I
used
that
word,
she
asked
me
to
articulate,
and
after
thinking
for
a
moment,
I
told
her
that
her
writing
lacked
flow
because
through
asides,
she
was
varying
from
the
logical
proof
of
her
thesis
that
was
the
point
of
her
paper.
After
saying
those
words,
I
immediately
realized
that
I
had
made
a
personal
revelation
on
a
weakness
in
my
own
writing.
It
was
at
that
moment
that
I
realized
why
I
am
a
WA,
knowledge
of
self,
rather
than
the
rather
large
increase
in
the
stipend.
Overall,
then,
the
last
year
has
been
very
productive
as
far
as
writing
is
concerned.
I
have
learned
innumerable
lessons
about
the
nature
of
writing
and
writing
development.
For
instance,
I
learned
that
no
matter
what
kind
of
writing
you
do,
whether
it
is
a
three
page
memo,
a
fifteen
page
paper,
or
a
thesis,
you
learn
something
valuable
about
how
to
think
and
express
yourself
that
helps
you
in
every
subsequent
piece
of
writing
that
you
do.
I
have
also
learned
that
writing
is
not
necessarily
fun,
but
if
done
well,
it
can
be
among
the
most
rewarding
of
endeavors.
Hopefully,
this
next
year,
through
continued
writing
and
being
a
WA,
my
writing
will
continue
to
develop
as
it
has
the
last
three
years.
And
hopefully,
there
will
be
some
poor
Junior
WA
with
no
class
to
WA
for,
who
will
be
willing
to
proofread
my
thesis
for
me,
if
I
actually
complete
it.
