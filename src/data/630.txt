Looking
Back
In
my
experiences
last
year,
I
found
myself
challenging
what
I
thought
were
absolute
rules
while
writing
for
my
classes,
from
experimenting
in
form
in
my
creative
endeavors
to
writing
an
essay
without
a
clear
direction,
while
learning
that
creating
a
website
can
be
a
lot
like
writing.
Instead
of
being
assigned
to
a
class
as
their
Writing
Associate,
I
was
assigned
to
the
College
Writing
Programyus
website,
which
was
looking
a
little
worse
for
wear.
While
fancy
fonts
and
dull
yellows
may
have
the
same
appeal
old
books
have
to
academics,
the
new
website
uses
a
bright
green
and
clean-cut
fonts
give
the
CWP
a
more
organized
feel.
Wordpress
gave
me
the
ability
to
create
an
easy-to-navigate
website
that
both
faculty
and
students
can
use
to
access
the
information
they
need.
Writing
both
the
Frequently
Asked
Questions
page
as
well
as
the
What
Your
Writing
Associate
Wants
You
to
Know
document
helped
me
see
that
any
writing
must
be
done
well,
especially
when
it
is
for
a
website.
Ideas
need
to
be
conveyed
in
a
clear,
concise
manner.
The
Internet
is
all
about
being
quickmuyou
only
have
a
small
window
of
time
to
put
information
into
a
personyus
brain.
In
writing
an
essay
for
a
class,
you
only
have
the
first
paragraph
to
put
your
ideas
out
there
and
hook
your
reader.
The
same
goes
for
writing
a
short
story
or
even
a
poem.
I
also
had
the
experience
this
summer
of
writing
for
a
magazine
and
learned
that
the
hook
is
especially
important
in
the
editorial
industry.
The
past
year
as
a
Writing
Associate,
I
have
learned
to
focus
on
the
higher
order
concerns
in
my
writing,
like
the
thesismuor
rather
the
idea
that
shapes
my
essaymuor
the
support
for
that
idea.
Talking
to
writers
in
drop-in
hours,
whether
acting
as
another
pair
of
eyes
or
as
a
helpful
brainstormer,
has
helped
me
in
my
own
writing
because
I
plan
for
writing
differently.
I
plan
a
brainstorm,
a
time
where
I
gather
the
bare
bones
of
my
writing,
and
then
schedule
the
actual
writing
time,
whether
it
is
fifteen
minutes
or
hours
upon
hours.
Some
of
my
most
memorable
writing
experiences
from
fall
2008
until
spring
2009
included
an
essay
I
wrote
in
Eighteenth
Century
Fiction
on
Samuel
Richardsonyus
Pamela,
an
essay
discussing
Jane
Bennett
of
Jane
Austenyus
Pride
and
Prejudice,
a
short
story
on
anorexia
in
my
Advanced
Creative
Writing
class,
and
a
short
story
focusing
on
the
ethics
of
taking
those
in
persistent
vegetative
state
(PVS)
off
of
life
support
for
my
VAST.
Eighteenth
Century
Fiction
was
my
first
300-level
English
class
and
walking
into
it,
I
was
terrified.
There
was
more
reading
that
I
was
used
to
and
the
discussions
occasionally
went
over
my
head,
so
when
the
time
came
to
write
essays,
I
knew
I
needed
to
work
harder
than
I
ever
had.
I
wrote
a
thesis
and
brought
it
into
my
professor,
who
pushed
me
to
think
more
about
the
essay
and
come
up
with
something
more
creative.
I
ended
up
writing
an
essay
about
the
specific
type
of
love
prevalent
in
the
novelmua
disciplined
love
necessary
for
a
successful
relationship
between
the
Master
and
Pamela.
It
was
a
difficult
essay
to
write
because
it
forced
me,
in
my
professoryus
suggestion,
to
trust
my
own
instincts
and
become
less
formulaic
in
my
writing.
Suddenly
that
methesis,
three
paragraphs
of
support,
conclusionmo
essay
I
had
been
writing
from
eighth
grade
on
did
not
cut
it.
I
needed
to
dig
deeper
and
form
my
own
specific
idea
about
the
novel.
I
kept
reading
and
re-reading
things
I
had
written
before
moving
to
rewriting
them
entirely.
Despite
my
attempts
to
let
my
thoughts
flow
(coherently)
on
paper,
the
criticism
remained
that
I
needed
to
trust
myself
more
and
to
just
write.
My
next
essay
to
tackle
was
in
my
Jane
Austen
class
in
the
spring
semester.
It
was
my
second
300-level
English
course
with
the
same
professor.
Whenever
I
tried
to
come
up
with
a
thesis
about
Jane
Bennett,
nothing
seemed
to
work.
I
had
quotes;
I
had
passages.
My
research
was
done.
The
question
was:
what
would
I
be
writing
about?
Instead
of
a
specific
thesis,
I
focused
on
a
character
sketch
of
Jane
Bennett
that
let
me
take
closer
looks
at
aspects
of
her
character
within
Pride
and
Prejudice.
It
was
the
hardest
paper
I
have
ever
had
to
write
because
I
relied
so
much
on
my
own
thoughts
and
words
than
I
did
the
text,
though
textual
support
did
exist.
The
process
was
frightening,
not
only
because
I
had
a
102
degree
fever
at
the
time,
but
also
because
I
wasnyut
relying
on
something
I
knew,
just
something
I
was
thinking.
For
my
last
short
story
in
Advanced
Creative
Writing,
I
wanted
to
tackle
an
important
issue
that
plagues
young
women,
eating
disorders.
I
chose
to
focus
on
anorexia
and
on
the
psychological
causes
that
can
influence
it.
What
was
hardest
was
to
not
reach
for
clichShi
images,
like
the
first
I
used
to
originally
open
the
story,
which
showed
a
girl
looking
into
a
cracked
mirror
and
feeling
upset
at
her
reflection.
With
my
writing
workshop
this
summer,
I
have
learned
that
subtext
in
fiction
is
key
support
for
the
plot,
like
textual
support
is
the
bare
bones
of
an
expository
essay.
What
lies
beneath
is
more
important,
like
the
Hemingway
model
of
the
iceberg.
The
subtleties
of
a
characteryus
movement
give
way
to
how
a
character
feelsmuit
does
not
have
to
be
described
fully,
just
as
going
into
too
much
depth
can
create
a
hard-to-read
essay.
Paring
it
down
is
always
better.
This
also
helped
with
the
short
story
I
wrote
for
my
VAST
class
on
Medicine
and
Melodrama.
I
wanted
to
experiment
with
form
for
this
short
story,
so
I
chose
to
start
it
off
in
stream-of-consciousness
of
my
protagonist,
changing
form
into
a
narrator
focusing
on
another
characteryus
feelings
as
my
protagonist
loses
her
consciousness
and
is
diagnosed
with
PVS.
I
thought
it
was
a
clever
idea
to
show
what
PVS
means,
but
those
in
my
workshop
did
not.
Some
liked
it,
some
didnyut.
My
teacher
claimed
that
if
it
needed
explaining,
it
shouldnyut
be
in
the
short
story.
People
take
different
approaches
to
writing,
whether
it
is
how
to
write,
how
to
edit,
how
to
read,
review,
and
pass
judgment.
What
we
learn
as
WAs
in
orientation,
in
staff
meetings,
or
student
conferences
helps
us
form
our
own
way
of
writing,
guided
by
the
importance
of
higher
order
concerns
versus
lower
order
concerns.
A
lot
of
what
we
learn,
even
in
high
school,
is
to
focus
on
the
grammar.
But
grammar,
on
a
larger
scale,
is
what
needs
tidying
up
after
our
writing
and
revision
process
has
ended.
In
the
magazine
world,
on
the
other
hand,
grammar
is
almost
everything.
The
way
you
say
something
is
exactly
how
a
reader
will
read
it.
You
have
to
twist
the
same
sentence
around,
shorten
up
paragraphs,
and
edit
until
it
is
exactly
right.
I
sat
beside
my
editor
as
she
went
through
my
writing,
changing
things
as
she
went
along,
explaining
them.
While
asking
a
student
questions,
as
a
WA
is
trained
to
do,
is
a
good
way
to
get
the
student
thinking
about
his
or
her
own
writing,
having
her
talk
to
me
about
my
own
writing,
about
my
strengths
and
weaknesses,
about
how
I
thought
this
sentence
should
be
changed
because
it
should
be,
or
here
are
your
two
options
for
where
this
phrase
should
go.
My
editor
helped
me
go
through
what
I
had
written
and
by
sitting
with
her
as
she
made
adjustments
to
my
writing,
I
was
better
able
to
write
my
next
article
for
the
magazine.
The
last
article
I
wrote
for
the
magazine
was
on
professional
organizers,
a
recent
trend.
All
these
people
make
New
Yearyus
Resolutions
they
do
not
keep,
like
losing
weight,
getting
finances
in
order,
or
getting
organized.
I
interviewed
five
experts
and
took
a
tip
from
each
of
them,
compiling
a
list
of
the
best
tips
to
get
organized
for
the
New
Year,
including
an
extra
tip
on
the
holidays.
It
will
be
a
full
page
article
in
the
magazineyus
popular
Holiday
Issue.
When
it
came
time
to
write,
I
didnyut
ask
for
help.
I
just
wrote.
What
these
jumbles
of
sentences
and
loose
words
turned
into
was
a
pulled-together
magazine
article.
I
set
aside
time
and
put
my
thoughts
down
on
paper.
I
went
through
my
interviews
and
chose
the
tips
I
thought
were
best
without
consulting
anyone
else.
My
writing
this
past
year
has
inspired
me
to
trust
myself
more.
My
best
advice
for
the
new
Writing
Associates
is
to
relax
and
soak
it
all
in.
There
is
a
lot
to
learn
and
not
much
time
to
learn
it
in.
Also,
take
pleasure
in
the
students
you
do
help,
whether
it
is
in
your
class
or
in
drop-in.
The
rewards
outweigh
the
obstacles.
One
of
my
favorite
memories
of
being
a
Writing
Associate
last
year
is
a
drop-in
conference.
Someone
came
in
with
a
notebook
and
nothing
else
other
than
a
brief
description
of
his
assignment
and
a
request
for
help
brainstorming.
All
I
did
was
sit
as
he
went
over
the
quotes
he
had
picked
out
and
what
direction
he
thought
he
should
move
in.
I
was
a
sounding
board.
He
walked
away
feeling
better
about
the
paper
he
needed
to
write
and
I
was
happy
he
had
gotten
the
help
he
wanted.
Receiving
my
acceptance
into
the
Writing
Associate
program
last
summer,
I
was
nervous.
I
was
unsure
what
being
a
Writing
Associate
meant.
In
a
sense,
while
not
receiving
a
class
was
disappointing,
it
gave
me
a
year
to
learn
so
much
more
about
the
program.
I
know
clearly
what
is
expected
of
me.
I
know
that
while
I
might
not
be
an
engineer,
it
does
not
matter
when
I
am
reading
an
engineeryus
paper.
What
matters
is
how
well
I
can
read
his
or
her
paper
and
help
them
make
it
better.
I
feel
more
confident
in
myself
as
a
writer
and
as
a
Writing
Associate.
