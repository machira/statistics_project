CWA
Assignment
The
Learning
of
an
Art
Form
In
my
opinion,
asking
for
a
person's
history
as
a
writer
is
like
asking
someone
to
describe
themselves
in
three
words
or
less
-
virtually
impossible.
Not
impossible
actually,
just
a
very
tough
task.
It
requires
a
reflection
back
to
a
time
where
papers
were
as
brave
as
"What
I
did
on
my
Summer
Vacation"
and
"How
Romeo
Fell
in
Love
With
Juliet".
Maybe
I
find
it
a
hard
task
because
up
until
college,
writing
was
nothing
but
a
pain
in
the
butt
to
me.
Papers
were
just
an
assignment
like
any
other
assignment.
It
wasn't
until
college
that
they
became
much
more
than
that.
It
is
not
hard
to
understand
how
I
can
remember
the
papers
I
wrote
in
college
better
than
those
in
my
grade
school
years,
but
there
are
four
or
five
different
occasions
in
my
youth
where
I
wrote
something
I
was
really
proud
of.
And
I
know
I
was
proud
of
them
because
I
can
still
find
them
sitting
in
my
desk
upstairs
in
my
bedroom.
I
actually
brought
them
down
to
the
computer
with
me
so
that
I
can
read
them
again,
and
tell
you
about
them.
I
think
looking
back
into
my
past
will
help
me
realize
how
far
I've
come
in
the
fifteen
years
since
I've
been
in
school.
The
first
piece
of
writing
I
found
upstairs
was
an
infamous,
"What
I
Did
For
Summer".
I
had
gone
to
a
soccer
camp
in
Lake
Placid,
New
York
with
four
of
my
best
friends.
I
entitled
the
work,
"The
5
Placid
Rangers"
because
every
morning
at
camp,
we
had
to
sing
this
silly
song
called,
"I
want
to
be
a
Placid
Ranger".
The
funny
thing
is
that
I
still
know
all
the
words
to
this
day.
The
writing
was
a
page
and
a
half
of
pure
boy
talk
and
a
little
talk
about
the
camp
itself.
I
ended
up
writing
about
all
the
cute
boys
my
friends
and
I
were
interested
in
at
the
time.
And
at
the
end,
I
just
concluded
that
it
was
the
summer
we
all
became
best
friends.
This
writing,
although
it
may
seem
small
and
unimportant,
easily
shows
how
I
am
as
a
writer.
I
feel
like
when
I
write,
it
should
be
just
as
if
I
was
talking
to
someone.
Of
course,
modem
writing
rules
usually
don't
allow
the
informal
use
of
addressing
a
person
in
a
paper,
but
it
is
much
easier
for
me
to
speak
than
it
is
for
me
to
write.
My
first
paper
is
just
that
-
me
speaking.
It
may
not
seem
like
a
good
trait
to
some
editors
or
writing
professionals,
but
I
find
it
to
be
my
best
trait.
I
don't
really
want
to
add
"fluff'
to
a
paper
-1
want
to
tell
it
straight.
If
I
can't
find
a
sentence,
all
I
need
to
do
is
go
to
a
friend
and
say,
"look,
this
is
what
I'm
trying
to
write,
but
I
can't
get
it
down
on
paper",
and
then
I
get
it.
Although
this
paper
may
not
have
been
the
greatest
recap
of
a
summer
gone
by,
it
does
let
the
reader
know
exactly
what
the
thirteen-year-old
author
was
thinking
about:
boys!
There
are
very
few
times
in
my
writing
history
that
I
can
say
I
was
a
creative
writer.
I
feel
that
is
my
one
down
fall.
I
try
to
be
creative,
but
I
am
just
not
a
creative
person.
I
can
hardly
doodle;
it
all
ends
up
being
boxes,
and
straight
lines.
I
guess
I'm
just
square.
But
there
was
one
time
in
grammar
school
that
I
had
to
write
some
poetry.
This
could
have
been
the
one
and
only
time
in
my
life
that
I
felt
I
was
creative.
When
I
found
the
poetry
packet
in
my
desk,
it
was
a
wonderful
feeling
to
re-read
it.
Even
though
I
did
it
when
I
was
in
5
grade,
I
can
still
feel
proud
of
the
poems
I
wrote.
In
a
range
from
a
rhyming
verse
called
"Things
That
Go
Bump
in
the
Night"
to
haiku
about
hatred,
I
feel
like
I
put
together
a
splendid
display
of
talent.
But
in
my
opinion,
it
may
have
been
short
lived.
Because
I
am
so
proud
of
this
writing,
I
am
going
to
give
you
a
sample
of
two
poems
I
wrote.
The
first:
White,
tall
as
the
clouds
in
the
sky.
A
cone.
White
blood
falling
on
it's
back.
A
snowy
mountain
stands.
The
second:
Listen,
no
one
breathes.
The
man
pulls
out
his
shotgun,
And
shoots
out
his
hate.
Chances
are
that
I
will
keep
this
poetry
booklet
for
a
long
time.
It
may
just
be
my
one
claim
to
creativity.
I
know
it
sounds
terrible
that
I
can't
call
myself
creative,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
I
am
not
expressive.
I
would
like
to
think
that
when
I
write
a
story,
not
a
research
paper,
or
an
assignment,
but
when
I
write
a
story
straight
from
my
life,
I
want
people
to
feel
my
words.
When
I
was
in
8
grade,
I
lost
a
very
good
friend.
His
name
was
Geoff,
and
he
once
dated
my
older
sister,
but
then
ended
up
becoming
a
wonderful
friend
of
the
family.
He
actually
lived
with
us
for
a
month,
and
in
that
time,
I
not
only
found
a
friend,
but
I
found
a
brother
I
never
had.
In
my
8th
grade
English
class,
I
was
asked
to
reflect
on
the
year
that
I
had
just
ended.
Geoff
had
died
on
the
last
day
of
school,
so
my
reflection
on
the
year
was
tainted
with
the
tears
of
his
death.
I
wrote
a
three-page
paper
one
night
after
his
death
that
was
full
of
pain,
tears,
and
questions.
I
wrote
about
how
I
didn't
understand
why
God
had
taken
him
from
us.
I
wrote
about
how
much
I
loved
Geoff
and
how
much
I
needed
him
to
be
back
with
us.
In
this
paper,
you
can
hear,
you
can
feel
my
pain.
I
think
that
is
a
wonderful
trait
for
a
writer.
The
one
problem
might
be
that
I
can
only
be
expressive
with
things
that
hit
close
to
my
heart.
But
if
there
ever
was
a
piece
of
my
writing
that
was
emotional
and
powerful,
it
was
when
I
was
thirteen
years
old
and
in
shackles
of
pain.
I
wish
I
could
hold
on
to
that
expressive
power
through
my
writing
years,
but
I
feel
as
if
I
can
only
be
that
way
when
something
touches
my
life
personally.
That
piece
of
writing
was
the
last
thing
I
found
in
my
desk.
They
might
be
the
only
pieces
that
I
was
proud
of
when
I
was
younger,
but
I
can't
completely
say
that
because
they
are
the
only
articles
I
can
remember.
That
could
be
the
hardest
aspect
of
this
assignment.
I
don't
remember
much
beyond
a
few
papers
in
high
school.
But
high
school
writing
seems
light
years
ago.
Things
for
me
have
changed
so
much
since
I
entered
college.
I
am
not
sure
if
it's
because
I
got
a
horrible
English
education
in
high
school,
or
whether
I
am
getting
an
amazing
one
in
college,
but
something
changed.
Writing,
which
used
to
be
a
pain,
is
now
a
challenge.
I
can
honestly
say
I
never
was
the
girl
who
sat
down
to
write
a
journal,
or
sat
down
to
write
a
short
story.
I
am
so
much
a
straightforward
person,
that
anything
I
needed
to
say,
I
just
said.
So
college
has
helped
me
learn
that
writing
is
not
just
a
way
to
express
yourself,
and
it's
not
just
a
pain
in
the
butt,
but
it
is
an
art
form.
I
think
that
is
the
one
thing
that
I
tackle
in
college.
I
want
to
create
the
art
form.
I
want
every
aspect
of
the
paper
to
fit,
like
pieces
of
a
puzzle.
And
when
it's
finished,
I
want
it
to
read
with
ease
and
power.
I
hope
that
everything
I
write
has
intelligence
to
it
that
no
one
else
hit
on
the
assignment.
The
one
aspect
of
my
writing
is
that
I
am
very
thorough,
and
using
the
guidelines
given
as
well
as
my
own
need
to
fully
explain
a
situation,
then
a
paper
should
be
an
informative
article
of
writing
that
answers
all
questions.
This
is
the
one
thing
that
is
different
in
my
writing
from
high
school
to
college.
I
have
always
followed
the
rules,
and
I
have
always
tried
to
be
thorough,
but
I
have
never
put
the
two
together
as
one
and
used
it
as
a
platform
to
create
an
intelligent
paper.
When
I
first
entered
college,
I
started
writing
in
the
usual
FYS
courses.
But
it
wasn't
until
I
entered
into
a
class
that
really
peaked
my
interest
that
I
began
to
write
to
what
I
would
say
was
good.
The
first
writing
course
I
ever
took
was
Law
and
Society
taught
by
Professor
Lennertz.
I
intend
on
going
to
Law
school
after
I
leave
Lafayette,
so
courses
such
as
this
one
were
always
interesting
to
me.
I
had
assignments
ranging
from
case
briefs
to
case
notes.
The
one
that
I
remember
the
best
and
am
most
proud
of
was
the
case
note
I
wrote
on
search
and
seizures
of
vehicles
in
America.
I
know
it
may
sound
boring,
but
it
wasn't
just
an
explanation
of
search
and
seizures
of
vehicles,
it
was
a
research
paper
on
everything
that
is
affected
by
it.
It
spanned
through
the
drug
problem
in
America
to
the
rise
of
the
automobile.
It
might
have
been
the
first
time
that
I
have
been
pressed
to
see
the
larger
issue.
When
I
was
finished,
I
had
seventeen
pages
of
research
completed.
It
was
the
first
time
any
paper
went
over
ten
pages,
and
probably
the
first
time
that
I
had
so
much
to
say.
The
paper
I
appreciate
the
most
was
actually
the
most
recent
paper
that
I
have
written.
It
was
for
my
VAST
course
called,
"What
Can
Be
Automated".
I
had
to
find
an
area
of
our
society
and
tell
how
automation
has,
or
is
going
to
affect
it.
I
of
course
chose
the
area
of
law
and
I
ended
up
writing
a
twelve-page
paper
analyzing
three
different
types
of
automation
used
in
the
area
of
law
from
a
simple
computer
program
to
a
highly
intelligent
automated
legal
magistrate.
I
didn't
just
complete
the
paper,
I
actually
was
interested
and
I
tried
my
best
to
make
things
work.
I
not
only
compared
the
pros
and
cons
of
each
automated
program,
but
I
compared
all
of
them
on
a
higher
level.
I
wanted
to
let
the
readers
know,
that
it
wasn't
just
a
research
paper,
it
was
a
look
into
the
future
of
automation
in
the
area
of
law.
When
I
was
finished,
I
had
an
A
on
the
paper,
and
the
sense
of
completing
something
that
was
a
great
piece
of
writing
-
not
just
because
there
was
an
A
on
the
paper,
but
because
I
felt
I
had
done
a
great
job
of
finding
interesting
things
to
write
the
paper
on
as
well
as
analyze
them
to
make
my
paper
fully
understandable.
This
is
the
one
thing
that
I
have
accomplished
since
I
began
writing:
the
understanding
that
a
paper
isn't
a
pain,
but
a
release
into
academia.
When
I
was
in
grammar
school
and
high
school,
papers
were
made
up
of
research
papers
that
an
encyclopedia
could
easily
be
used
to
create
a
three-page
paper.
But
now,
I
have
been
pushed
to
not
just
write,
but
to
analyze,
to
shape,
to
create
something
original,
interesting,
and
understandable.
I
have
come
to
love
the
structure
of
a
well-written
paper,
and
the
fluidity
of
paragraphs
forming
together
to
make
a
whole.
Maybe
it's
because
college
is
the
first
place
where
I've
been
pushed
to
evaluate
my
education,
or
maybe
it's
because
I
have
just
found
the
love
of
writing,
but
whatever
it
is,
I
hope
to
never
stop
learning
and
improving
on
this
art
form.
