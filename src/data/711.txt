Returning
WA
Literacy
Narative
Half
way
through
my
second
semester
as
a
WA,
something
happened
that
enlightened
me.
It
didnOt
occur
in
a
writing
conference
or
in
communication
with
a
student.
It
happened
at
a
Farinon
lunch
table.
In
between
bites
of
soggy
pasta,
my
friend
leaned
over
and
said,
NIOve
got
this
huge
like
fourteen
page
paper
due
on
Thursday,
do
you
think
if
I
finished
a
draft
tonight
you
could
WA
it
for
me?O
I
was
shocked
because
this
small
interaction
taught
me
a
lot
about
being
a
writing
associate,
and
college
writing
as
a
whole.
For
starters,
I
loved
that
my
friend
used
the
word
NWAO
as
a
verb.
He
could
have
said
Nedit,O
Nread
over,O
or
any
number
of
terms
that
donOt
really
fit
the
full
nature
of
the
work
that
writing
associates
do.
Plus,
the
term
NWA-itO
holds
a
bit
of
mystery,
and
my
friendOs
use
of
the
phrase
implied
that
I
had
some
magical
process
that
all
WAs
know
that
somehow
churns
average
writing
into
classic
literature.
In
conjunction
with
that,
my
friend
didnOt
think
twice
when
I
asked
him
to
meet
up
with
me
latter
on
to
talk
about
the
piece;
it
was
understood
that
having
a
meeting
was
a
key
part
of
the
process
and
I
wouldnOt
be
just
emailing
this
paper
back
to
him
with
a
couple
notes.
When
we
met,
I
didnOt
have
some
oner-liner
piece
of
advice
that
changed
the
paper
from
a
C+
to
Shakespeare.
In
fact,
I
didnOt
have
too
much
to
say
at
all.
As
I
usually
try
to
do,
I
let
my
friend
talk,
about
his
paper
and
his
ideas.
I
asked
questions,
and
pointed
out
segments
that
confused
me
as
a
reader.
It
was
as
average
and
typical
as
a
WA
conference
can
get.
At
the
very
end
of
our
little
writing
session,
my
friend
thanked
me
profusely
and
said
he
would
never
have
gotten
through
the
process
if
I
hadnOt
helped
him.
The
two
most
important
things
I
learned
from
that
experience
were
that,
A.
the
further
you
get
into
college
writing,
sometimes
the
more
you
want
the
aid
of
a
WA,
and
B.
writing
is
a
very
personal
experience.
Starting
out
as
a
sophomore
WA,
I
thought
that
conferences
with
first
years
would
be
the
easiest
because,
naturally,
theyOre
the
ones
most
anxious
to
be
helped.
As
it
turns
out,
they
can
also
be
the
ones
most
reluctant
to
accept
help
in
the
form
of
facilitative
questions
rather
than
comments.
A
lot
of
that
reluctance
stems
from
the
second
observation;
first
year
students
are
entering
a
new
environment
where
they
will
be
graded
with
different
standards
and
they
want
to
be
told
they
belong,
specifically
in
an
area
like
writing
that
is
not
quantitatively
scored.
My
conference
with
my
friend
was
a
breeze
because,
although
he
was
a
peer,
he
understood
that
WAs
know
their
stuff
and
have
a
method
that
works
best
for
students.
I
found
similar
responses
in
writing
conferences
with
other
sophomores
my
second
semester
in
the
program.
Upperclassmen
knew
what
they
would
get
from
a
conference
and
how
to
prepare
for
one.
Sophomores
often
came
with
specific
areas
they
were
struggling
with,
because
they
knew
that
would
be
my
first
question.
First
years
were
more
reluctant
to
admit
they
were
having
a
tough
time,
or
just
the
opposite-
they
would
look
down
upon
everything
they
had
written.
My
friend
also
sank
a
bit
into
that
first
year
mentality
by
telling
me
his
paper
was
NcrapO
that
he
had
rushed
to
do
because
of
other
assignments
or
a
lack
of
interest
in
the
topic.
What
he,
and
so
many
other
students,
really
meant
was
that
he
was
unsure
about
the
paper.
This
particular
paper
was
for
a
course
which
had
mandatory
WA
meetings,
and
on
top
of
that,
the
CWP
offers
drop
in
sessions
for
three
hours
nightly.
The
fact
that
my
friend
still
chose
to
come
to
me
was
an
eye
opener.
Since
writing
is
such
a
personal
experience,
and
an
experience
he
did
not
feel
he
excelled
at,
he
only
felt
comfortable
showing
me
his
work.
This
paper
was
not
a
narrative,
a
short
story,
or
any
work
of
creative
fiction,
it
was
an
academic
paper.
Yet
when
people
form
their
words
together
in
any
manner,
theyOre
materializing
their
voice
and
their
thoughts.
Criticism
on
writing
can
often
feel
like
criticism
of
our
minds
or
ourselves
rather
than
criticism
of
our
work.
The
reason
I
agreed
to
help
this
and
other
friends
is
because
I
know
the
ones
that
reach
out
to
me
trust
me,
and
sometimes
only
me,
with
their
thoughts
and
writing.
Knowledge
about
the
personal
nature
of
writing
does
not
only
help
in
conferences
with
friends.
The
experience
of
NWAingO
friends
showed
me
how
important
it
can
be
to
establish
a
relationship
with
any
student
I
conference
with.
Instead
of
diving
into
the
paper,
itOs
great
to
ask
the
student
how
he
or
she
feels
the
course
is
going,
why
he
or
she
chose
the
course,
and
how
he
or
she
feels
about
the
professor.
The
more
talkative
students
become,
the
more
open
they
may
be
about
sharing
ideas,
a
key
element
of
the
writing
conference.
They
also
might
mention
areas
of
the
course
they
enjoy
the
most,
which
can
lead
to
research
paper
topics
at
the
end
of
the
semester.
While
itOs
important
for
WAs
to
remain
professional,
a
relaxed
atmosphere
definitely
makes
students
feel
more
engaged.
The
story
of
my
WA
experience
with
my
friend
demonstrates
an
important
aspect
of
the
writing
associate
job:
itOs
a
job
you
learn
by
doing.
Of
course,
I
didnOt
only
learn
critical
lessons
from
WAing
my
friends,
though
it
was
an
experience
that
proved
to
me
how
much
students
at
this
school
grow
to
value
WAs.
Looking
back
now,
a
year
after
first
becoming
a
WA,
the
job
was
fairly
different
than
I
expected.
I,
like
most
WAs
I
assume,
came
into
the
program
with
preconceived
notions.
I
thought
we
would
learn
exactly
how
to
read
over
papers
in
training.
WeOd
be
given
lists
of
elements
to
check
over:
are
the
paragraphs
in
just
the
right
order?
Is
the
vocabulary
college
level?
Instead
of
talking
about
the
actual
elements
of
papers,
we
spent
a
lot
more
time
talking
about
ideas
and
the
right
questions
to
ask.
When
I
was
assigned
to
WA
a
course
on
music
history,
I
honestly
thought
there
was
no
way
I
could
help
these
kids.
I
went
four
conferences
before
one
of
the
students
politely
told
me
that
Richard
Wagner
is
actually
pronounced
Richard
Vogner.
That
didnOt
exactly
instill
much
confidence
that
I
could
help
them
create
literary
genius.
Yet
as
it
turned
out,
it
was
great
that
I
knew
very
little
about
music.
The
best
writers
depicted
sound
so
well
that
I
had
no
trouble
following
along.
It
takes
the
best
of
the
best
to
explain
something
to
an
idiot,
I
suppose.
I
asked
tons
of
questions,
because
I
really
had
no
idea
what
the
material
was
about,
and
in
turn
those
questions
helped
the
students
better
clarify
their
work.
Before
my
first
conferences,
I
also
dreaded
the
blank
page.
I
thought
that
a
student
showing
up
with
little
to
no
work
would
be
an
outrage,
a
waste
of
both
our
time.
Though
every
once
in
a
while
a
blank
page
means
the
student
hasnOt
even
read
the
assignment,
most
of
the
time
it
means
the
student
is
really
lost.
This
confusion
can
be
the
perfect
time
for
a
WA
to
step
in
and
act
as
an
organizer.
IOm
pretty
good
at
moving
from
concepts
and
ideas
into
a
paper
outline,
and
that
can
be
a
transition
that
trips
up
new
writers.
A
half
hour
conference
can
easily
move
from
a
couple
vague
topics
into
a
strong
argument
with
a
bit
of
direction.
The
second
thing
that
got
my
nerves
up
was
conferencing
about
the
same
paper
twice.
I
originally
thought
if
I
got
the
writer
to
discuss
everything
I
wanted
to
in
the
first
conference,
there
would
not
need
to
be
a
second
one.
I
was
completely
wrong.
Having
two
conferences
about
one
paper
can
be
both
one
of
the
most
challenging
and
rewarding
experiences.
When
a
student
returns
with
a
piece
that
has
been
reworked
and
refined
with
ideas
that
came
up
in
the
first
meeting,
itOs
an
awesome
feeling.
You
can
tell
them
why
the
changes
are
working
and
affirm
that
the
points
are
easier
to
understand.
When
a
student
comes
back
with
the
exact
same
essay
printed
out
a
second
time,
it
can
definitely
sting.
Sometimes
the
latter
can
mean
that
the
student
really
hasnOt
looked
at
the
piece
since
the
first
draft,
but
it
can
also
mean
that
elements
discussed
in
the
first
conference
were
not
clear.
I
think
itOs
alright
to
ask
why
the
student
has
decided
to
leave
sections
unchanged,
because
perhaps
thereOs
a
reason.
In
the
end
itOs
always
important
to
remember
that
the
work
and
ideas
belong
to
the
student,
and
if
they
choose
not
to
take
information
from
the
conference
into
account
when
working
on
a
new
draft,
thatOs
their
choice.
In
the
end,
IOve
learned
that
being
a
writing
associate
has
two
main
benefits
for
the
actual
WA.
The
first
is
that
WAs
get
to
hear
so
many
voices
and
so
many
stories.
The
FYS
and
VaST
programs
that
most
of
our
WAs
work
with
offer
a
wide
array
of
interesting
topics
that
provoke
many
different
ideas
in
papers.
I
learned
so
much
from
reading
all
the
different
papers
in
the
class;
the
VaST
I
WAed
talked
about
everything
from
operas
to
Hitler.
One
of
my
students
even
interviewed
her
grandfather,
a
Holocaust
survivor.
In
drop-in
I
had
the
privilege
of
help
a
student
with
a
piece
of
creative
non-fiction.
It
was
an
instructional
tale
about
the
dos-and-donOts
of
cheating
at
Monopoly,
a
skill
the
writer
had
perfected.
I
thought
it
was
a
privilege
to
get
a
chance
to
be
a
part
of
someoneOs
creative
process
on
such
a
unique
paper.
The
truth
is,
itOs
a
privilege
to
be
a
part
of
anyoneOs
creative
process,
because
reading
student
writing
tells
you
a
lot
about
the
other
students
at
Lafayette:
their
beliefs,
their
motives,
and
their
passions.
ItOs
tough
to
be
surrounded
by
a
process
of
helping
other
writers
and
reading
so
many
other
studentsO
works
without
being
affected
yourself.
Being
a
WA
has
certainly
impacted
my
own
work,
specifically
the
way
I
edit
it.
Sometimes
I
get
so
critical
that
I
can
barely
begin
the
paper;
I
start
thinking
that
a
reader
wonOt
make
the
connections
IOm
making
between
topics,
or
a
reader
wonOt
understand
the
main
point
of
my
paper
if
I
start
with
a
vague
paragraph.
The
main
point
here
is
that
IOm
always
thinking
about
the
reader,
even
at
the
start
of
my
project.
IOll
occasionally
write
a
draft
first,
just
to
get
my
ideas
out,
but
most
of
the
time
my
inner
WA
voice
starts
yelling
at
me.
College
certainly
asks
you
to
make
the
jump
between
what
the
CWP
calls
Nwriter
based
proseO
and
Nreader
based
prose.O
With
my
students,
I
usually
point
this
out
by
talking
about
the
segments
that
I,
as
a
reader,
do
not
fully
understand.
This
exercise
starts
the
writers
on
a
path
to
realizing
that
writing
is
not
all
about
the
writer
getting
her
ideas
out
of
her
head,
itOs
about
conveying
ideas
from
the
writer
to
the
reader
through
the
medium
of
words.
Writing
with
the
reader
in
mind
means
always
having
a
clear
view
of
the
audience
of
the
paper.
I
am
constantly
wondering
if
IOve
effectively
analyzed
quotes
or
organized
paragraphs
so
that
the
professor
will
see
the
strengths
of
my
arguments,
as
most
of
my
papers
are
written
in
this
style.
The
idea
of
Nreader
based
proseO
certainly
helps
my
creative
writing
as
well,
because
words
and
meaning
are
taken
as
the
reader
interrupts
them,
not
the
way
the
writer
intends.
Being
a
WA
has
made
me
slightly
more
self
critical,
but
given
me
to
ability
to
reread
my
work
from
the
perspective
of
an
outsider,
and
ask
questions
that
I
am
then
forced
to
clarify
in
my
writing.
All
in
all,
my
first
year
as
a
WA
showed
me
that
holding
effective
writing
conferences
and
Nbeing
a
good
WAO
are
skills
you
learn
through
interactions
with
your
students.
IOve
seen
that
students,
both
first
years
and
upperclassmen,
value
the
chance
to
have
an
outside
reader
who
is
not
their
professor
speak
with
them
about
their
work.
I
no
longer
fear
conferences
that
start
with
no
essay,
and
I
know
that
conferencing
the
same
piece
several
times
can
still
be
beneficial
to
both
the
student
and
to
me.
I
understand
that
writing,
even
in
an
academic
setting,
is
very
personal,
and
an
openness
with
your
students
can
help
facilitate
much
better
discussions.
IOve
seen
all
these
elements
crop
up
in
and
aid
my
own
writing,
and
IOve
had
the
amazing
opportunity
to
enter
the
minds
of
my
peers.
