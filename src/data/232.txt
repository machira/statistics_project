Writing
as
a
Sophomore
WA:
The
Year
in
Review
Although
I
have
written
very
little
in
the
past
year,
I
think
that
I
will
be
a
stronger
writer
this
fall
than
I
was
this
time
last
year.
This
improvement
stems
not
from
intensive
efforts
in
writing
per
se,
but
rather
from
my
experiences
as
a
Writing
Associate
to
a
First-Year
Seminar
last
autumn
and
to
a
VAST
course
this
past
spring.
The
truism
that
states
something
is
easier
when
one
is
not
directly
involved
applies
to
writers
as
well
as
to
anyone
else.
Since
I
examined
so
many
papers
as
an
"informed
peer,"
able
to
see
errors
dispassionately
in
several
forms
of
writing,
an
improvement
in
my
ability
to
pick
out
mistakes
and
flaws
in
my
own
writing
was
inevitable,
thus
making
me
a
stronger
writer.
I
feel
my
increasing
strength
as
a
writer
is
clearly
demonstrated
by
the
two
major
papers
I
was
required
to
write
last
year.
These
two
papers
both
dovetailed
nicely
with
my
experiences
as
a
WA.
The
first
of
these
two
papers
was
for
the
McKelvy
Scholars
Program.
The
guidelines
for
the
assignment
were
deceptively
simple.
All
I
had
to
do
was
write
a
research
paper
on
a
topic
of
my
choice
which
would
then
be
published
in
The
McKelvy
Papers.
After
weeks
of
deliberation
I
decided
to
write
a
paper
about
the
Protestant
Reformation,
a
subject
of
considerable
personal
and
intellectual
interest.
Meanwhile,
I
began
my
first
series
of
conferences
as
a
WA.
I
was
shocked
when
I
read
through
the
first
batch
of
papers.
Many
of
the
essays
would
not
have
passed
muster
in
my
junior
English
class.
However,
I
had
to
allow
for
the
fact
that
these
essays
were
rough
drafts
and
the
exceptional
caliber
of
my
high
school's
English
Department.
After
I
set
aside
this
first
impression,
I
realized
something
else.
Many
of
the
problems
within
these
essays
mirrored
my
own
difficulties
with
writing,
albeit
on
a
larger
scale.
Sensing
a
common
ground
between
myself
and
the
freshmen
I
was
responsible
for,
I
dove
into
the
task
with
renewed
interest.
What
I
found
most
difficult
in
that
first
semester
was
resisting
the
temptation
to
rewrite
sentences
or
even
entire
paragraphs
the
way
I
would
have
phrased
them.
Many
sentences
had
what
I
perceived
to
be
an
awkward
construction.
Although
I
realized
that
I
should
not
expect
others
to
write
with
the
same
style
that
I
use,
I
found
not
imposing
my
style
on
other
writers
to
be
the
aspect
of
the
job
that
required
the
most
effort.
I
will
admit
that
on
several
occasions
I
did
impose
my
will
on
the
students,
but
this
intervention
had
ended
by
the
beginning
of
the
second
semester.
After
my
second
round
of
conferences
I
was
feeling
more
confident
about
my
role
as
a
WA
and
how
to
balance
my
vision
of
how
to
make
a
better
writer
with
that
of
the
program.
However,
fate
intervened
at
this
time.
I
had
just
begun
my
research
for
my
McKelvy
paper
when
I
grew
ill
several
times
without
any
apparent
reason.
I
would
be
fine
one
day
other
than
a
sore
throat
but
feverish
and
exhausted
the
next.
After
a
week
of
this
I
went
home
for
Thanksgiving
and
went
to
see
a
doctor
since
my
sore
throat
had
developed
to
the
point
that
drinking
water
was
a
serious
effort
and
talking
pure
torture.
I
feared
strep
throat,
but
as
soon
as
the
doctor
examined
me
he
informed
me
that
I
was
suffering
from
mononucleosis.
For
three
days
I
barely
left
my
bed,
as
both
the
illness
and
the
drugs
I
was
taking
sapped
the
energy
from
me.
I
rushed
my
return
back
to
school
and
promptly
bombed
an
organic
chemistry
exam
for
my
troubles.
I
was
forced
to
skip
my
last
set
of
meetings
for
the
semester
and
to
request
an
extension
on
my
McKelvy
paper,
since
I
had
fallen
a
week
behind
on
research
and
spent
every
moment
I
was
not
eating
or
in
class
asleep.
Over
the
semester
break
I
produced
my
paper
for
McKelvy,
a
five-thousand
word
evaluation
of
the
history
and
relevance
of
the
Protestant
Reformation.
I
then
submitted
my
paper
to
the
evaluation
board,
consisting
of
senior
members
of
the
McKelvy
program,
of
which
the
majority
had
experience
as
Writing
Associates.
The
evaluation
produced
many
of
the
results
I
anticipated,
a
few
capitalization
and
comma
errors,
but
also
one
thing
I
had
not
expected.
One
of
the
evaluators
pointed
out
my
tendency
to
use
the
vernacular.
Whereas
this
vernacular
might
sound
wonderful
inside
my
head,
the
evaluator
pointed
out
that
it
had
no
place
in
such
a
paper
intended
for
publication.
As
I
reflected
on
this
observation,
I
realized
how
heavily
I
had
come
to
lean
on
vernacular
and
slang
to
emphasize
points.
Suffice
to
say,
I
have
since
made
a
conscious
effort
to
keep
to
more
"regular"
language.
Once
I
finished
my
paper,
I
spent
a
fair
amount
of
time
pondering
my
future
as
a
WA.
I
had
applied
to
continue
for
the
spring
semester,
but
I
figured
I
would
not
be
invited
back
due
to
my
less
than
stellar
performance
and
my
not
always
seeing
eye-to-eye
with
the
program
advisors.
However,
shortly
before
the
beginning
of
the
semester
I
learned
that
I
would
once
again
be
a
Writing
Associate.
Determined
to
make
the
most
of
this
opportunity,
I
re-examined
everything
I
had
done
as
a
WA
the
previous
semester.
As
it
would
turn
out,
my
second
semester
would
go
less
smoothly
than
the
first.
The
instructor
of
the
class
I
was
attached
to
would
give
me
conflicting
orders
on
how
to
deal
with
students,
and
seemed
to
tell
me
the
assignments
but
not
the
students.
The
nature
of
the
assignments
were
also
quite
irregular,
more
along
the
lines
of
brief
engineering
memos
than
a
standard
writing
assignment.
Ironically,
I
was
forced
to
focus
on
the
mechanics
of
the
assignment
rather
than
the
content
because
very
few
of
the
students
understood
what
format
the
instructor
expected.
Around
this
time
I
began
running
into
one
of
the
most
common
and
most
frustrating
problems
that
Writing
Associates
are
forced
to
deal
with-people
forgetting
or
outright
skipping
the
meetings
they
had
signed
up
for.
This
had
not
been
a
real
problem
first
semester,
since
the
professor
required
the
students
to
meet
with
me
or
else
fail
the
assignment.
If
a
student
did
miss
a
meeting
a
brief
phone
call
usually
arranged
a
new
meeting.
The
VAST
students,
however,
were
not
as
committed
to
the
idea
of
meeting
with
me.
The
majority
of
the
students
did
come
to
the
meetings,
since
they
often
needed
guidance
on
the
assignments,
but
several
people
would
miss
each
round
of
meetings
and
never
returned
my
phone
calls
concerning
rescheduling.
The
instructor
also
told
me
that
I
must
reschedule
missed
meetings,
in
direct
conflict
with
the
guidelines
of
the
program.
I
informed
the
heads
of
the
WA
program
of
this
and
other
problems
with
this
class,
and
to
my
knowledge
that
instructor
will
not
be
teaching
a
VAST
course
this
coming
year.
Meanwhile,
my
VAST
course
had
begun
writing
with
a
vengeance.
I
was
required
to
write
a
five-hundred
word
editorial
every
week
in
response
to
some
technology
issue
in
the
news.
Also,
we
made
preparations
for
the
class
term
paper,
which
required
groups
of
three
to
write
a
paper
of
not
less
than
sixty
pages
concerning
a
major
technological
change
and
how
that
technology
changed
society.
This
project
was
difficult
not
only
because
of
the
sheer
size
of
the
assignment
but
also
because
each
person
had
to
write
a
portion
of
the
paper
that
would
complement
and
flow
with
the
other
sections.
The
research
alone
for
the
paper
was
quite
taxing.
I
had
already
started
the
research
for
my
portion
of
the
paper
when
I
received
a
telephone
call
from
one
of
my
fellow
group
members.
He
told
me
that
he
did
not
think
he
would
be
able
to
write
an
adequate
paper
on
his
topic
and
asked
that
we
swap
sections.
Faced
with
the
possibility
of
a
bad
section
wrecking
the
entire
group's
grade,
I
had
no
choice
but
to
agree
to
the
switch.
I
handed
over
to
my
group
mate
the
research
I
had
already
completed,
but
he
had
done
nothing
more
than
check
out
library
books
on
his
topic.
With
no
small
annoyance
I
began
my
research
anew.
Meanwhile,
I
continued
my
conferences
with
the
students
in
the
VAST
I
was
assigned
to.
The
majority
of
the
students
complained
on
several
occasions
about
their
instructor's
teaching
methods
and
lack
of
clarity
in
assigning
work.
I
felt
sympathetic
for
the
students,
as
I
felt
their
complaints
were
legitimate,
but
this
put
me
in
an
impossible
situation.
While
I
abhor
seeing
any
instructor
causing
a
student
grief,
a
situation
which
I
have
personally
experienced
several
times,
as
a
Writing
Associate
I
may
not
express
any
negative
feelings
towards
any
authority
figure,
especially
the
instructor
I
am
assigned
to.
What
I
finally
settled
on
doing
was
telling
the
students
to
discuss
their
problems
with
the
instructor,
and
if
that
failed
to
generate
results
than
to
complain
to
the
administration.
I
also
made
polite
suggestions
to
the
instructor
and
notified
the
heads
of
the
WA
program
of
the
problems
in
the
class.
While
I
felt
that
I
was
not
being
of
enough
assistance
to
the
students,
I
now
realize
that
this
was
the
extent
of
the
aid
I
could
provide
to
them
in
my
position.
After
spring
break
I
began
the
actual
writing
of
the
paper
for
my
VAST.
I
was
determined
to
apply
the
lessons
I
had
learned
from
my
paper
for
the
McKelvy
Scholars.
I
doubled
the
effort
I
usually
put
into
proofreading,
since
none
of
my
friends
had
the
time
to
pick
through
my
paper
and
it
would
have
been
colossally
unfair
to
expect
my
WA
to
go
through
it
checking
for
capitalization,
parallelism
and
comma
errors,
in
addition
to
the
standard
concerns
of
keeping
to
my
thesis
and
flow.
I
also
read
every
sentence
individually
as
I
wrote
it
and
again
after
I
had
finished
writing
the
paper
looking
specifically
for
use
of
vernacular
or
slang.
At
one
point
I
struck
an
entire
page
from
the
paper
and
rewrote
it
because
I
saw
it
had
too
many
problems
to
fix
them
all.
Although
this
approach
was
both
incredibly
time-consuming
and
very
short
on
excitement,
it
did
lead
to
a
better
paper.
To
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
there
was
not
a
single
problem
with
my
final
paper
in
form
or
keeping
with
the
assignment.
I
cannot
say
the
same
for
my
fellow
group
members.
Even
after
I
conducted
exhaustive
proofreading
I
believe
there
were
still
mistakes
in
their
sections.
Although
I
received
an
"A"
for
my
section
and
the
paper
earned
an
"A-"
overall,
I
would
not
care
to
write
another
paper
as
part
of
a
group.
Although
I
had
finished
my
final
paper
at
this
point,
the
students
whom
I
was
WA
for
were
still
working
on
their
final
assignments.
I
scheduled
two
meetings
with
each
student
over
the
course
of
this
paper.
The
first
session
had
been
much
like
the
others,
explaining
the
assignment
to
the
students
and
listening
to
their
complaints.
The
second
round
of
conferences
went
much
smoother,
as
the
students
had
regular
papers
which
I
could
evaluate
as
opposed
to
the
constrictive
engineering
style
of
papers
which
had
so
bewildered
them.
I
was
finally
able
to
apply
the
lessons
I
had
learned
from
my
experiences
the
first
semester.
Overall
that
was
probably
the
most
satisfactory
round
of
conferences
I
had
all
year,
as
I
was
able
to
fully
interact
with
the
students
and
help
them
in
the
way
the
program
was
intended
to.
So,
I
return
to
the
program
this
fall
somewhat
wiser
and
much
more
experienced
as
a
Writing
Associate
and
as
a
writer.
Although
the
volume
of
my
writing
last
semester
was
nothing
exceptional,
the
effort
I
put
into
the
pieces
I
did
produce
was
considerable.
My
creative
writing
skills
may
not
be
much
improved,
but
I
feel
that
my
ability
to
produce
academic
discourse
has
strengthened.
I
have
no
doubt
that
my
participation
in
the
WA
program
is
a
major
contributing
factor
to
my
increased
proficiency.
This
suggests
to
me
the
veracity
of
another
truism,
"He
who
helps
others
really
helps
himself."
While
this
may
not
be
the
ideal
recruitment
slogan
for
the
Writing
Associate
program,
it
does
tell
of
perhaps
the
greatest
benefit
one
takes
out
of
the
program.
