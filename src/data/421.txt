Narrative
NThe
giant
panda
weighs
70-125
kg
and
lives
in
the
forests
of
China.O
This
is
the
first
sentence
of
my
report
on
the
giant
panda
which
I
wrote
in
second
grade.
This
report
is
the
first
writing
memory
I
have.
I
sat
down
with
a
book
that
I
checked
out
of
the
library
and
wrote
my
rough
draft
with
my
mother.
Every
night
for
a
week
I
sat
after
dinner
to
write
more
of
my
report.
When
I
had
written
it
on
paper,
I
sat
as
my
mom
typed
it
on
the
computer.
This
four
page,
double-spaced
report
marked
my
first
A
on
a
writing
assignment.
One
thing
that
I
learned
from
this
experience,
although
I
was
young,
was
that
proper
planning
and
organization
made
the
writing
process
much
easier.
When
I
write
reports
or
research
papers
now,
although
I
do
not
have
my
mother
next
to
me
to
keep
me
on
track,
I
still
use
the
techniques
she
taught
me
in
second
grade.
My
third
grade
teacher
assigned
a
project
to
be
completed
over
winter
break.
The
assignment
was
to
write
our
own
fairytale
and
illustrate
it.
I
remember
the
excitement
that
I
felt
when
she
announced
this
to
us
in
class.
As
she
further
explained
the
assignment
I
started
to
lose
my
excitement
and
instead
began
to
feel
horrified
of
the
project.
Back
in
that
third
grade
room,
Ms.
Bronson
presented
the
first
of
many
writing
challenges
to
come
in
my
life.
I
had
to
write
three
rough
drafts,
two
final
drafts
and
illustrate
one
of
the
final
drafts.
The
horror
came
when
she
announced
that
all
of
the
drafts
had
to
be
written
in
cursive.
I
had
never
written
in
cursive,
let
alone
even
attempted
the
task.
When
I
looked
around
the
classroom
I
realized
that
I
was
not
the
only
one
terrified
by
the
assignment.
As
I
sat
at
home,
the
winter
in
California
became
the
gloomiest
time.
Sure,
the
sun
was
shining
and
it
was
eighty
degrees
but
I
needed
to
overcome
my
fear
of
writing
in
cursive.
As
I
started
to
write
I
remember
thinking
that
the
words
just
looked
like
a
lot
of
loops
and
curves.
I
did
not
know
how
to
make
some
letters,
such
as
the
NsO
so
I
would
make
a
printed
NsO
and
just
extend
the
lines
on
the
top
and
bottom
curve.
Letters
such
as
the
NzO
and
the
capital
NlO
seemed
impossible
to
me.
That
was
the
longest
winter
break
in
my
educational
experience.
I
faced
another
problem
shortly
after
conquering
writing
in
cursive.
I
did
not
have
a
story,
nor
did
I
know
how
to
write
a
fairytale.
I
decided,
after
many
days
of
deliberation,
to
write
about
a
boy
named
Jack
who
had
to
save
the
kingdom
from
an
ice
cube
spitting
dragon.
Realizing
now
that
it
was
not
very
original,
however,
I
did
overcome
my
first
fear
in
writing--I
wrote
my
very
own
fairy
tale
and
I
did
it
in
cursive.
At
such
a
young
age
I
was
given
the
opportunity
to
explore
my
handwriting
and
then
to
implement
my
new
penmanship
by
writing
a
story.
I
asked
my
mom
to
write
all
of
the
letters
in
cursive
and
leave
three
lines
after
every
letter.
I
then
re-drew
all
of
her
letters
and
thus
learned
how
to
write
in
cursive,
or
more
specifically,
my
motherOs
cursive.
This
was
the
only
help
I
received
on
that
project.
When
I
entered
fourth
grade,
I
was
assigned
yet
another
project
that
made
me
nervous.
Mrs.
Freedman
handed
out
the
paper
with
the
assignment
on
it
and
at
the
top
in
big
bold
letters
read:
YOUR
FIRST
RESEARCH
PROJECT.
I
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
this
title;
I
had
never
done
research.
As
she
explained
the
project,
she
told
us
we
needed
to
have
six
sources,
rough
drafts
and
a
final
typed
report
in
a
report
cover.
A
little
over
a
year
before
I
had
learned
how
to
write
in
cursive;
now
I
was
going
to
need
to
learn
how
to
type.
My
life
was
over.
I
did
not
have
the
luxury
this
time
of
a
long
winter
break,
but
only
three
weeks
during
school
to
complete
the
project.
The
subject
I
was
assigned
was
the
maple
leaf.
This
time
I
asked
my
mom
to
accompany
me
to
the
library,
but
she
explained
that
since
I
was
a
Nbig
boyO,
I
could
go
to
the
library
alone
and
conduct
the
research
by
myself.
Mrs.
Freedman
handed
us
another
paper
with
specific
details
on
how
to
conduct
proper
research.
After
I
checked
out
all
of
the
books
I
could
find
that
had
the
word
NleafO
in
them,
I
began
to
write
my
research
project.
Before
I
knew
it,
I
had
written
five
pages
on
the
maple
leaf.
As
I
scrolled
down
the
paper
with
the
assignment
on
it,
I
read
the
words:
MUST
BE
TYPED.
This
time
my
mother
would
not
help
me.
I
had
never
typed
anything--I
was
only
in
fourth
grade.
Nonetheless,
I
got
the
job
done.
The
many
skills
I
learned
from
this
first
research
project,
I
continue
to
use
and
develop.
When
I
do
research
projects
currently,
I
still
use
the
same
format
that
I
learned
in
fourth
grade.
That
project
taught
me
how
to
plan
out
the
research
paper,
conduct
the
appropriate
research
and
compile
all
the
information
into
a
thorough
paper.
My
years
in
junior
high
school
were
the
years
that
prepared
me
for
high
school.
At
my
junior
high
we
had
a
gifted
magnet
in
addition
to
the
traditional
school.
I
was
in
the
gifted
magnet,
but
occasionally
had
to
take
traditional
school
classes.
In
seventh
grade
I
was
put
into
a
traditional
school
English
class.
There
were
students
in
my
class
of
many
different
races
and
ethnicities,
which
often
contributed
to
the
presence
of
language
barriers.
The
focus
of
this
class
was
American
literature.
After
our
first
novel,
The
Adventures
of
Huckleberry
Finn,
was
completed,
we
were
assigned
to
write
a
persuasive
essay
on
the
novel.
With
only
a
brief
explanation
of
what
a
persuasive
essay
was
and
how
to
write
one,
as
well
as
a
prompt
that
was
written
on
the
overhead,
I
found
myself
once
again
presented
with
a
writing
challenge--my
first
persuasive
essay.
I
had
to
write
an
essay
about
whether
or
not
I
felt
that
the
novel
represented
America
both
when
it
was
written
and
presently.
As
a
seventh
grader
I
had
an
opinion
about
everything
(I
would
argue
all
the
time),
but
now
that
I
had
to
write
a
paper
and
convince
the
reader
that
my
argument
was
valid,
I
found
this
difficult.
It
was
time
to
call
in
for
backup.
My
aunt
is
an
exceptional
writer,
who
is
currently
writing
a
novel
that
will
hopefully
be
published.
Just
as
the
mayor
of
Gotham
City
called
Batman
on
the
red
telephone
to
save
the
day,
a
crying
seventh
grader,
me,
called
my
aunt
to
save
the
day.
I
did
not
have
an
opinion
on
the
novel,
and
I
certainly
did
not
know
what
America
was
like
back
when
it
was
written.
My
aunt
helped
me
form
an
opinion
and
an
argument
about
the
text
by
asking
me
a
series
of
open
ended
questions.
Some
of
these
questions
included:
NHow
did
the
story
make
you
feel
when
you
read
it?O
and
NWhat
do
you
think
the
message
Mark
Twain
was
trying
to
convey
when
he
wrote
this
novel?O
It
was
these
questions
that
helped
me
to
explain
that
Mark
Twain
captured
many
of
the
American
ideals
that
we
live
by
today
and
that
Americans
lived
by
back
then.
I
thought
the
nightmare
of
my
first
persuasive
essay
was
over
when
I
handed
it
in.
Instead,
I
was
presented
with
a
new
hurdle.
On
the
day
the
essay
was
due
in
class,
we
did
not
hand
them
in
to
the
teacher.
Instead,
we
were
instructed
to
get
into
groups
of
four
students
and
switch
essays
amongst
the
four.
I
had
never
had
anyone
aside
from
the
teacher
read
my
writing.
This
made
me
nervous.
What
if
the
other
students
did
not
like
my
essay?
What
if
their
argument
was
the
opposite
of
mine?
What
if
their
essays
were
better?
We
received
a
handout
in
our
groups
that
had
editing
symbols
on
it.
When
we
read
each
othersO
essays
we
were
told
to
give
positive
and
constructive
criticisms.
When
I
read
the
first
essay
I
realized
that
it
was
written
by
a
student
who
did
not
speak
English
very
well.
The
grammar
was
poor
and
the
spelling
was
even
worse.
I
could
also
see
that
this
same
student
whose
paper
I
was
reading
was
also
struggling
with
the
other
essays.
I
felt
that
it
was
my
duty
as
a
peer
to
help
this
student.
I
corrected
the
grammar
and
gave
suggestions
on
how
to
better
complete
his
sentences.
I
felt
good
about
myself
after
reading
his
paper,
not
because
it
made
my
essay
look
better,
but
because
I
felt
that
I
had
shared
the
knowledge
that
I
recently
learned
from
my
aunt
on
how
to
write
a
persuasive
essay.
I
received
my
essay
back
and
it
had
gotten
rave
reviews.
They
all
loved
my
essay
and
many
of
them
agreed
with
my
points
and
examples.
I
felt
confident
about
my
writing.
I
learned
more
than
just
how
to
write
a
persuasive
essay
in
Ms.
FischOs
seventh
grade
English
class;
I
learned
that
having
others
read
my
work
was
a
positive
and
important
experience
in
writing.
Without
the
input
of
my
peers
I
would
have
left
many
points
out
or
left
them
unclear.
I
currently
have
another
individual
read
and
edit
my
papers
before
I
turn
them
in,
to
make
sure,
like
that
first
persuasive
essay,
that
they
are
clear,
thorough
and
to
the
point.
After
junior
high,
I
entered
the
ninth.
I
felt
confident
because
I
had
prepared
for
this
day
for
three
years
in
junior
high.
Once
again
there
were
two
English
classes
in
my
high
school.
This
time
it
was
the
honors
English
class
and
the
regular
ninth
grade
English
class.
I
was
once
again
put
into
the
regular
English
class.
On
the
first
day,
this
woman
with
short,
dark
brown
hair,
big
glasses,
an
attitude
and
a
white
shirt
came
storming
into
the
classroom
and
shouted,
NTAKE
NO
PRISONERSO.
She
then
asked
anyone
if
they
could
recite
a
poem
from
memory.
The
only
person
who
raised
her
hand
was
a
girl
who
was
then
transferred
into
the
honors
English
class.
The
students
in
both
classes
read
the
same
books
and
did
the
same
projects.
The
difference,
however,
was
that
my
teacher
spoke
to
us
as
if
we
were
two
years-old
while
she
spoke
to
the
honors
English
students
as
if
they
were
in
college.
We
were
assigned
our
first
persuasive
essay
during
the
first
week
of
school.
Times
had
changed.
I
only
had
one
week
to
read
a
novel
and
to
complete
a
final
draft
of
a
persuasive
essay.
I
had
to
read
the
book
on
my
own
and
find
my
own
peers
to
read
and
edit
my
paper.
I
realized
then
that
maybe
junior
high
had
not
prepared
me
at
all
for
high
school.
A
red
circle
took
up
a
quarter
of
the
inside
page
of
my
essay
when
I
got
it
back.
Inside
the
red
circle,
sloppily
written,
was
the
letter
F.
I
looked
through
my
paper
but
found
no
other
red
markings.
On
the
back
there
were
three
words
written
with
the
same
red
marker:
NNOT
VALID
POINT.O
When
I
approached
the
teacher
after
class
had
ended,
she
explained
to
me
that
my
argument
was
not
worth
arguing
and
that
although
I
gave
excellent
examples
and
was
detailed
in
my
argument,
it
did
not
fit
her
criteria
for
the
novel.
I
did
not
know
if
I
should
feel
disappointed
or
mad
at
her
or
at
myself.
All
of
that
confidence
that
came
from
junior
high
was
gone
within
one
week
of
starting
high
school.
Throughout
the
course
of
the
year
we
were
giving
many
assignments,
including
a
research
paper
and
a
creative
writing
assignment.
The
highest
mark
I
received
with
the
teacher
was
a
B-;
however,
my
peers
who
would
edit
my
papers
continually
gave
me
two
thumbs
up
and
excellent
remarks.
Miraculously,
I
managed
to
receive
an
A-
in
her
class
both
semesters
of
my
ninth
grade
year,
but
I
now
felt
nervous
and
scared
to
write
anything.
She
had
taken
away
all
the
confidence
that
I
had
possessed
just
a
year
before.
As
a
result
of
attending
a
small
high
school,
we
only
had
nine
teachers,
two
of
whom
were
English
teachers.
For
my
tenth
and
eleventh
grade
years,
I
had
a
different
teacher
than
the
one
I
had
for
ninth
grade.
When
I
entered
Mrs.
BrownOs
classroom
in
tenth
grade,
it
was
completely
different
than
the
one
I
came
from
next
door.
It
was
bright
and
full
of
life
with
wonderful
novels.
Our
first
writing
assignment
was
to
write
about
our
summer.
I
was
scared
to
write
this
essay
because
of
my
experience
the
prior
year,
but
to
my
delight,
I
received
my
paper
back
with
a
smiley
face
and
one
red
word
this
time:
NWONDERFUL!O
My
tenth
grade
year
was
a
great
one.
I
learned
so
much
in
Mrs.
BrownOs
class.
Not
only
did
she
teach
me
how
to
write
a
well-rounded
essay,
but
she
also
taught
me
how
to
turn
a
prompt
into
a
full
introduction.
She
explained
to
me
that
the
thesis
sentence
is
the
road
map
to
the
essay.
She
built
up
my
confidence
as
a
writer
again
and
I
became
comfortable
writing.
In
eleventh
grade,
she
prepared
us
for
the
AP
English
exam.
This
was
the
composition
test.
We
practiced
with
the
past
yearOs
test
and
we
wrote
essay
after
essay
after
essay.
On
the
day
of
the
exam
I
felt
like
I
did
that
day
in
seventh
grade.
I
was
excited
once
again
to
share
my
work
with
others.
When
I
received
the
results
from
my
test
explaining
that
I
had
received
a
four
out
of
a
possible
five
score
on
my
exam,
I
was
revived.
I
no
longer
felt
that
I
was
a
bad
writer
and
now
I
felt
that
I
had
proof
of
this.
Unfortunately,
when
I
began
my
senior
year,
I
found
myself
back
in
my
ninth
grade
English
teacherOs
room;
this
time
I
was
in
honors
AP
English.
On
the
first
day
of
class,
she
told
me
that
she
was
hardest
on
the
students
she
loved
the
most.
I
thought
she
was
giving
an
explanation
for
her
remarks
and
behavior
two
years
prior;
what
I
did
not
realize
was
that
she
was
foreshadowing
the
year
to
come.
I
was
treated
even
worse
this
time
in
her
class.
I
received
my
essays
back
with
a
red
F,
not
in
a
circle
and
with
no
explanation.
I
could
not
satisfy
what
this
teacher
wanted.
I
once
again
felt
hopeless
and
like
a
failure
at
English.
We
prepared
for
the
AP
English
Literature
exam
this
year.
I
took
it
and
felt
that
I
did
horribly
on
it.
To
my
surprise
I
passed
the
exam
with
a
three;
however,
it
was
still
lower
than
my
previous
exam.
At
the
end
of
the
year,
I
was
chosen
to
deliver
the
graduation
speech
I
had
submitted.
It
was
an
honor,
the
principal
told
me.
When
I
delivered
the
speech,
I
could
see
members
of
the
audience
wiping
their
eyes
with
a
tissue.
I
knew
I
had
written
a
good
speech.
I
was
congratulated
by
my
ninth
and
twelfth
grade
English
teacher.
She
said
it
was
the
best
graduation
speech
she
had
ever
heard.
I
later
opened
my
report
card
to
see
that
I
received
a
C
in
the
class.
This
experience
in
high
school
not
only
changed
who
I
am
as
an
individual
but
also
who
I
am
as
a
writer.
I
never
received
any
help
or
constructive
criticism
from
my
teacher.
I
came
into
my
freshman
year
of
college
at
the
University
of
California,
Santa
Barbara
with
no
confidence
as
a
writer.
I
took
courses
that
required
as
little
writing
as
possible,
as
I
was
scared
to
write
and
express
my
opinion.
When
I
transferred
to
Lafayette
and
was
assigned
a
WA
in
my
English
110
class,
I
was
at
first
skeptic
of
the
program.
I
thought
it
was
going
to
be
my
English
teacher
screaming
at
me
that
I
wrote
a
horrible
paper
and
not
give
me
any
explanation.
Instead,
my
WA
gave
me
constructive
criticism
and
guidance
on
my
papers.
She
was
a
useful
resource
that
I
could
use
anytime
when
writing
a
paper.
She
felt
my
writing
was
excellent
and
recommended
me
to
the
WA
program.
Here
I
am
today,
accepted
into
the
program
and
ready
to
play
the
same
role
in
another
studentOs
writing
experience
as
my
WA
did
for
me.
I
feel
fortunate
to
have
this
title
and
I
am
anxious
to
start
mentoring
and
encouraging
those
students
who,
like
me,
came
into
college
feeling
like
they
did
not
write
well.
I
am
always
growing
as
a
writer
and
realizing
how
important
a
skill
it
is
to
possess.
