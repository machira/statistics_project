Putting
Together
a
Large
Piece
of
Furniture
in
the
Basement:
The
Discoveries
of
a
Returning
WA
Not
too
long
ago,
my
grandfather
and
I
were
delegated
the
task
of
assembling
a
dresser
to
be
used
as
a
storage
center
for
clothes
I
would
wear
in
the
future.
We
coasted
through
the
initial
stages
of
construction
without
a
hitch.
And
just
when
we
thought
we'd
soon
be
toasting
our
glasses
of
preferred
alcoholic
beverages,
a
hitch
came
a
knockin'.
It
wasn't
clear
why
the
hinges
on
the
door
were
incompatible
with
the
screw
targets
on
the
corresponding
areas
of
the
main
dresser
unit.
Our
lazy
Sunday
brains
struggled
for
quick,
cheap
answers.
We
experimented
with
different
physical
scenarios,
but
began
leaning
toward
the
conclusion
that
the
purchaser
of
this
forsaken
dresser
had
been
swindled.
After
some
painful
mental
acrobatics,
however,
I
found
the
not-so-obvious
way
of
positioning
both
the
dresser
and
the
hinges
so
that
our
laborious
efforts
would
ultimately
be
celebrated.
Indeed
they
were!
In
many
ways,
this
very
real
anecdote
serves
as
a
parallel
for
several
important
themes
within
the
realm
of
the
WA.
Most
significantly,
I've
picked
up
on
the
benefits
of
a
trial-and-error
approach.
One
should
not
expect
to
be
fully
prepared
for
an
individual's
conference
and
follow
this
same
template
again
and
again.
It
may
take
some
time
before
the
WA
can
grasp
how
to
best
gauge
a
writer's
style,
especially
since
it
is
clear
that
each
student
has
his/her
own
unique
history
as
a
writer.
If
there
are
three
sets
of
conferences
in
a
given
semester,
maybe
things
won't
click
until
the
second
or
third
time
around.
One
should
not
only
try
new
approaches
each
successive
semester,
but
it
also
seems
useful
to
examine
the
gradual
progress
of
each
student
writer.
Though
they
seem
cliches
at
this
point,
patience
and
open-mindedness
are
two
of
the
more
dominant
traits
I
now
rely
upon
to
fulfill
WA
responsibilities.
Patience
certainly
comes
into
play
whenever
a
student
presents
a
query
that
is
not
immediately
answerable.
The
WA,
in
this
case
me,
needs
to
be
aware
that
the
solution
will
come
in
due
time;
unless
it's
finals
week,
there
shouldn't
be
a
sense
of
sudden
death,
clock
running
down,
spectators
on
the
edge
of
their
sticky
seats,
sweaty
desperation
in
the
air.
The
prospect
of
an
open
mind
is
the
cornerstone
of
the
trial-and-error
approach.
The
WA,
again
me,
needs
to
be
willing
to
adopt
new
expectations
and
techniques,
leaving
the
outside
light
on,
prepared
for
the
likely
event
of
a
wayfaring
idea.
The
two
semesters
spanning
the
academic
year
2000-2001
were
quite
different.
For
purposes
of
this
essay,
I
shall
focus
on
the
second
semester
which
consisted
of
more
substantial
writing.
My
history
class,
for
example,
challenged
me
with
the
project
to
write
a
large-scale
term
paper.
The
last
time
I
recall
completing
something
of
this
nature
was
my
report
on
a
fatal
disease
assigned
during
my
senior
year
of
high
school.
Similar
to
my
research
of
yesteryear,
I
was
required
to:
1)
design
an
outline
of
my
topic
(The
Moral
Basis
of
Roman
Slavery),
2)
investigate
and
list
sources
I
expected
to
use,
and
3)
produce
several
drafts
of
a
coherent
paper.
I
found
this
structure
uncommon
among
the
papers
I've
written
in
college.
For
this
reason,
I
welcomed
the
assignment
and
looked
forward
to
the
single
most
satisfying
reward:
Being
done
with
it!
In
addition,
this
type
of
assignment
allowed
me
to
explore
the
specifics
of
research
methodology
within
the
field
of
history.
I
initially
expected
this
term
paper
to
be
like
all
term
papers
--
trite
and
repetitive.
It
took
some
time
to
shake
this
boorish
notion
and
realize
how
much
innovation
was
required
to
organize
long-standing
theories
in
a
new
light.
It
was
difficult
at
first
to
speak
to
an
audience
with
whom
I
had
never
made
contact.
I
found
it
an
enlightening
experience
to
branch
out
from
my
cold
and
dreary
mathematical
comer.
The
challenge
of
heightening
my
sense
of
the
professor's
expectations
was
also
a
formidable
task.
It
was
necessary
to
interpret
his
initial
comments
and
follow
up
with
any
misunderstandings.
An
English
course
based
on
the
dynamics
of
the
interrelationship
between
film
and
literature
also
proved
to
be
a
formative
writing
experience.
Here,
too,
I
learned
how
to
reach
the
nerve
endings
of
a
new
and
unfamiliar
discipline.
It
was
somewhat
eye-opening
to
be
given
the
opportunity
to
write
a
paper
about
a
classic
science
fiction
film
and
all
the
while
adhere
to
a
writing
process
typically
applied
to
Hawthorne
stories
and
Shakespeare
plays.
My
deep
interest
in
movies
was
sharpened
by
my
newfound
knowledge
of
their
roots
in
literature
(writing
for
the
screen).
I
think
it
was
healthy
for
me
to
write
seriously
about
something
that
didn't
appear
to
have
any
academic
origins.
My
WA
assignment
for
spring
semester
was
interesting
and
contributed
to
my
development
as
a
veteran
WA
in
a
couple
of
ways.
Firstly,
this
was
my
first
assignment
that
had
me
meet
with
students
and
discuss
successive
drafts
for
one
paper.
This
meant
that
I
needed
to
keep
a
mental
log
on
each
student's
previous
draft
as
we
worked
through
the
process.
I
found
such
a
circumstance
to
be
beneficial
to
my
ongoing
analysis
of
each
student's
progress.
Secondly,
the
course
called
for
a
"scientific"
paper.
I
am
not
yet
able
to
recite
a
precise
definition
of
"scientific"
in
this
context,
but
I
can
tell
you
that
the
papers
a)
were
very
structured,
b)
included
a
detailed
explanation
of
a
medical/scientific
concept,
c)
were,
at
times,
difficult
to
read
by
the
very
nature
of
the
subject,
and
d)
involved
the
use
of
clear
and
concise
language
characteristic
of
articles
that
can
be
found
in
scientific
journals.
With
these
experiences
under
my
belt,
I
feel
a
slight
tickle
below
my
right
ear
that
may
or
may
not
be
my
body's
involuntary
acknowledgement
of
the
imminent
(if
it
hasn't
happened
already)
end
of
"creative
writing"
as
I've
known
it
in
the
past.
Allow
me
to
explain.
I've
often
thought
of
creative
writing
as
the
result
of
an
open-ended
assignment
with
few
parameters.
I
don't
see
much
of
that
anymore.
Now
that
I
think
about
it
though,
perhaps
this
rant
is
more
of
an
acknowledgement
of
"Inventing
the
University"
than
anything
else.
My
film
paper,
for
instance,
required
a
substantial
effort
to
familiarize
myself
with
the
terminology,
and
then
to
apply
the
fundamental
language
of
the
genre
to
my
paper.
I
was
compelled
to
be
creative
in
my
application
of
themes
and
my
use
of
illustrative
examples.
I
think
I
like
the
idea
that
with
each
assignment
I'm
indirectly
inventing
a
new
battle
plan.
An
experience
at
work
this
summer
allowed
me
to
observe
the
injurious
nature
of
what
a
"Writing
Associate
Gone
Bad"
might
look
like.
(Any
embellishments
are
purely
accidental
to
my
memory.)
One
of
the
cooler
aspects
of
the
internship
was
the
opportunity
to
create
a
brochure,
a
booklet
outlining
facts
and
highlites
of
the
program
for
prospective
candidates.
During
an
intern
meeting,
the
ten
of
us
sat
down
and
discussed
what
we
needed
to
do
to
stay
on
track
and
get
this
project
done.
Harry
inteijected
at
some
point
and
asked
that
we
look
over
his
submission
to
the
brochure
(as
most
of
us
were
assigned
a
particular
section
to
write).
As
his
draft
made
its
way
around
the
table
for
peer
review,
the
rest
of
us
engaged
in
casual
conversation.
Finally
(for
I
was
sitting
next
to
Harry
and
thus
the
last
link
on
the
chain)
I
got
the
chance
to
peruse
Harry's
writing.
Up
to
me,
it
appeared
no
one
really
found
any
glaring
errors.
I
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
job,
with
small
boo-boos
such
as
the
lack
of
a
comma
in
a
compound
sentence.
I
hastily
pointed
it
out
to
Harry
and
started
to
return
the
document
when,
from
over
my
shoulder,
Sally
grabbed
it
and
began
marking
it
up
like
an
evil,
merciless
grade
school
teacher.
She
mumbled
phrases
like
"bad
syntax"
and
"it
just
sounds
better"
while
she
attacked
the
page.
I
was
stunned
and
disgusted.
I
caught
up
with
Harry
as
we
walked
back
to
our
respective
departments.
I
ended
up
apologizing
on
behalf
of
Sally,
embarrassed
for
her
impertinence.
As
an
apparent
defense
mechanism,
Harry
replied,
"It's
all
right.
I'm
used
to
it;
I'm
not
much
of
a
writer
anyway."
I
proceeded
to
tell
Harry,
"Regardless,
it
was
a
very
unprofessional
move
on
her
part."
Throughout
this
ordeal
I
reminded
myself
about
my
experience
as
a
Writing
Associate.
I
thought
about
the
perspective
I
gained
from
dealing
with
peers
in
similar
situations
as
above.
I
thought
about
how
Sally's
actions
lacked
compassion
and
tactfulness.
True:
As
a
group
of
interns
sitting
around
a
large
table,
we
were
not
in
the
ideal
one-on-one
environment
characteristic
of
most
WA
conferences.
Also
true:
The
corporate
atmosphere
in
which
we
worked
may
not
have
been
conducive
to
a
fireside
chat
about
grammar
guidelines.
Nevertheless,
the
interaction
I
witnessed
could
have
(and
should
have)
been
improved
in
order
to
maximize
understanding
and
respect
for
Sally's
critique.
I
am
grateful
to
have
obtained
this
perspective
from
staff
meetings,
other
WAs'
wartime
stories,
and
my
own
experiences
in
conferences.
Barring
any
unforeseen
catastrophes,
this
will
be
my
last
year
as
a
Writing
Associate,
rendering
this
my
final
literacy
narrative.
I
must
admit,
I
do
not
wish
to
face
my
mortality
and
pass
on
without
a
legacy.
Without
further
filibustering,
I
bequeath
this
short
but
valuable
list
of
"recommendations
a
future,
or
present,
WA
might
think
about
while
wondering
how
to
go
about
participating
in
the
writing
program

success
and
efficiency
as
priorities
on
their
list
of

in

there
somewhere!)
2.
