J.
WA
Narrative
Prof.
Patricia
Donahue
Entering
into
my
Junior
year
at
Lafayette,
I
was
doubtful
that
writing
would
play
a
large
role
in
my
continued
education.
After
all,
I
was
about
to
dive
head
first
into
the
hardest
year
of
the
Mechanical
Engineering
curriculum.
History
taught
me
that
I
would
be
spending
most
of
my
time
taking
partial
derivatives,
solving
ordinary
differential
equations,
and
developing
expressions
to
model
the
heat
transfer
process
through
a
coffee
cup.
At
that
time
my
apprehension
of
upcoming
academics
took
priority
over
my
personal
growth
as
a
writer.
However,
the
year
proved
to
lead
me
into
various
fields
I
had
heretofore
never
experienced.
Come
springtime,
when
I
began
to
reflect
about
academics
and
life,
I
noticed
that
I
had
been
dealing
with
a
diverse
group
of
audiences.
Modern
art
critics,
political
scientists,
engineers,
and
chemists,
to
name
a
few,
had
all
requested
some
sort
of
written
philosophizing
from
this
engineering
neophyte.
During
the
year
that
I
was
supposed
to
be
inundated
with
science,
I
instead
found
myself
further
developing
as
a
writer.
In
order
to
understand
my
mindset
in
the
fall,
a
portrait
of
the
engineer's
life
needs
to
be
painted.
Within
the
halls
of
A.H.E.
(Translation
for
A.B.
majors:
the
engineering
building)
an
apparent
pecking
order
exists
in
the
various
classes.
Freshman
and
sophomores
are
lumped
into
a
monolithic
group,
while
upperclassman
can
be
found
conferring
with
each
other,
and
questioning
professors.
Is
this
ageism?
A
silly
prejudice
based
not
upon
talent?
Or
could
there
be
an
alternative
explanation.
An
outsider
may
not
understand,
but
the
segregation
is
institutional
rather
than
cultural.
No
matter
what
discipline
a
student
wants
to
study,
they
must
first
develop
an
adequate
scientific
background
in
order
to
understand
the
theory
of
their
field
of
interest.
Therefore,
the
first
two
years
of
engineering
are
essentially
the
same
for
all
B.S.
students.
It
is
in
the
third
year,
however,
that
the
background
is
complete
and
intense
study
of
a
discipline
begins.
While
professors
often
comment
that,
this
is
when
the
fun
starts,
students
refer
to
the
time
as
hell.
Not
only
does
your
social
life
end,
all
outside
communication
with
the
world
stops.
The
vicious
cycle
torments
students
year
round.
A.H.E/Sleep/
A.H.E./Sleep.
This
is
how
I
entered
my
junior
year,
mind,
body,
and
soul
focussed
on
science,
even
my
WA
class
was
the
engineering
VAST.
Yet
when
I
reminisce
about
my
year,
I
recall
some
notable
projects
that
markedly
affected
me
as
a
writer.
My
WA
experience,
a
foray
into
the
world
of
modern
art,
and
my
first
true
intellectual
paper
all
contributed
to
what
I
feel
was
significant
growth
in
my
ability
to
write
for
a
number
of
different
purposes
and
audiences.
My
first
experience
as
a
writing
associate
was
with
the
engineering
VAST
class.
Unlike
the
majority
of
VAST's
that
try
to
expose
students
to
more
technical
and
scientific
pursuits,
the
engineering
VAST
focusses
on
developing
an
engineer's
ability
to
write
about
the
technical
issues
he
studies.
Since
I
had
taken
the
course
the
previous
year,
I
felt
justified
in
offering
advice
about
the
various
assignments.
However,
my
experience
also
threatened
to
make
the
work
monotonous.
Not
only
would
I
be
reading
twenty
papers
with
similar
topics,
I
had
also
completed
the
assignments.
One
thing
I
did
not
anticipate
that
kept
the
work
interesting
was
the
varying
range
of
ability
to
write
within
the
class.
While
some
students
had
clear,
concise
prose,
many
others
were
still
struggling
with
the
basics
of
writing
a
research
paper.
The
stereotype
of
the
inarticulate
engineer,
proficient
with
equations
but
not
words,
was
applicable
to
far
too
many
students.
My
main
challenge
with
the
class
was
not
in
offering
advice
that
could
improve
the
readability
of
papers,
but
in
convincing
engineers
that
writing
was
a
necessary
skill
for
them
to
develop.
Many
students
had
chosen
engineering
as
a
major
predominantly
because
they
did
not
enjoy
writing.
But
they
did
not
understand
that
the
most
important
aspect
of
a
professional
engineers
job
is
communicating
their
knowledge
with
others.
This
experience
challenged
me
to
not
only
help
improve
a
writers
ability
to
communicate
an
idea,
but
I
had
to
work
with
an
often
reluctant
audience.
Surprisingly
enough,
my
own
engineering
courses
did
not
require
any
term
papers.
Primarily
my
involvement
with
writing
was
limited
to
my
work
as
a
writing
associate,
however
there
were
a
few
exceptions.
One
of
these
exceptions
with
my
one
elective.
The
solitary
non-engineering,
fun
course
for
the
semester
was
an
art
history
class
focussing
on
modern
art.
This
course
had
a
structure,
much
like
modern
art
itself,
that
was
very
open
to
personal
interpretation.
The
course
only
required
two
essay
exams,
and
one
term
paper.
Adding
to
my
freedom
within
the
course
was
the
entirely
self-developed
paper
assignment.
As
long
as
I
wrote
about
something
artistic
in
the
twentieth
century,
I
could
do
anything
I
wanted.
The
main
challenge
I
faced
with
the
paper,
and
the
course,
was
learning
to
interact
with
an
audience
I
had
never
experienced
before.
Modern
art
was
always
an
interest
of
mine,
but
this
was
my
first
formal
exposure
to
the
field.
The
complete
freedom
of
the
assignment
actually
inhibited
my
ability
to
write
the
paper.
For
the
first
time
I
developed
a
serious
case
of
writers
block.
After
changing
my
topic
several
times,
I
still
could
not
make
any
notable
progress
on
the
paper.
I
fell
into
a
trap
I
frequently
noticed
in
my
WA
class,
getting
away
from
my
own
basic
writing
process.
I
was
so
worried
about
the
conventions
of
the
art
world,
and
what
was
important
to
discuss,
I
forgot
how
to
discuss
it
in
a
paper.
After
completing
my
research,
I
immediately
began
to
write
at
the
computer,
avoiding
any
brainstorming
or
outlining.
This
lack
of
forethought
manifested
itself
in
many
painful,
fruitless
sessions
at
my
computer.
Only
after
recognizing
my
lack
of
planning
was
I
able
to
finish
the
paper.
Although
the
audience
I
was
writing
for
was
foreign,
I
discovered
that
I
did
not
need
to
alter
my
style
or
process
to
be
successful.
Actually,
it
was
when
I
abandoned
my
process
that
I
had
the
most
difficulty.
When
I
recall
the
project
that
I
was
most
proud
to
be
involved
with,
and
the
one
that
I
think
marked
a
major
transition
for
me
as
a
writer,
it
is
without
question
my
involvement
with
the
McKelvy
Papers.
The
McKelvy
Papers
is
a
published
collection
of
works
produced
by
the
members
of
McKelvy
House.
Contributions
to
the
work
are
voluntary,
and
the
only
requirement
is
that
the
submissions
must
be
intellectual.
What
sparked
my
interest
in
contributing
to
the
journal
was
a
thought
I
had
while
working
as
a
WA.
A
major
revelation
I
had
while
was
how
boring
it
must
be
for
professors
to
read
and
grade
papers.
Generally,
topics
were
very
similar,
if
not
the
same,
and
identical
mistakes
were
made
time
and
time
again.
I
concluded
that
while
these
papers
may
have
been
academic,
they
were
not
intellectual.
When
there
was
a
clear
thesis,
it
was
usually
not
original.
The
research
papers
I
was
reading
were
glorified
book
reports;
summaries
of
information
that
proposed
nothing
new.
While
they
served
a
purpose
in
developing
researching
and
writing
skills,
I
realized
for
the
first
time
that
the
assignments
were
just
a
step.
My
paper
for
the
journal
was
an
opportunity
to
publish
a
hypothesis
I
had
developed,
and
attempt
to
prove
it
to
an
audience
of
professional
scholars.
Luckily,
my
experience
with
the
art
class
taught
me
how
to
avoid
being
stifled
by
complete
freedom.
For
the
first
time
I
was
not
writing
to
complete
an
assignment,
nor
was
I
using
creative
writing
as
an
outlet.
I
became
a
true
academic.
The
ability
to
write
was
just
a
tool
used
unconsciously
to
argue
my
thesis.
My
goal
was
not
a
grade.
Instead,
my
goal
was
to
discuss
an
argument
with
scholars,
and
to
convince
them
that
my
hypothesis
was
valid.
This
project
became
more
personal
and
demanding
since
it
was
entirely
my
thoughts
being
argued.
I
only
used
research
to
support
my
ideas,
instead
of
gleaning
my
ideas
from
the
research.
Although
I
am
unsure
about
how
successful
my
ideas
in
that
paper
were,
I
know
that
it
was
due
to
their
merit
and
not
because
they
were
not
fully
expressed
by
my
writing.
When
I
decided
to
apply
to
be
a
WA,
I
had
hoped
that
it
would
improve
my
own
writing
skills.
I
thought
reading
over
a
hundred
student
papers
a
year
could
help
expose
me
to
different
styles,
and
hopefully
help
my
writing
become
more
fluid.
While
I
feel
my
writing
has
definitely
improved,
it
has
not
happened
how
I
intended.
My
style
has
not
changed,
rather
my
organization,
construction,
and
thesis'
have
all
become
much
sharper.
While
what
I
think
may
not
always
be
right,
I
can
at
last
present
my
ideas
undistorted.
