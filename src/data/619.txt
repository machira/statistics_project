Literacy
Narrative
As
a
characteristically
shy,
yet
eager
new
addition
to
the
second-grade
class,
I
was
hesitant
to
become
involved
in
any
type
of
extracurricular
activity.
Even
in
pre-school,
it
is
understatement
to
say
that
I
had
a
tough
time
making
friends,
and
my
teachers
had
an
even
tougher
time
getting
me
away
from
my
mother
and
joining
the
class.
By
the
time
I
got
to
elementary
school,
I
knew
that
schoolwork
was
a
priority,
and
reading
and
writing
quickly
became
some
of
my
favorite
hobbies
so
it
was
easy
to
keep
up
with
my
work.
However,
my
preference
for
such
activities,
which
do
not
require
social
interaction,
also
made
it
easy
for
me
to
isolate
myself
and
maintain
my
quiet
disposition.
I
remember
the
routine
lunches
in
the
cafeteria,
where
my
peers
would
chitchat,
in
their
(always
pleasant)
pre-pubescent,
high-pitched
and
bird-like
voices,
each
attempting
to
win
the
attention
of
the
other
students
with
exciting
stories
about
games,
clubs,
or
groups
that
occurred
outside
of
school,
all
of
which
were
too
intimidating
and
completely
foreign
to
me.
I
stuck
to
my
role
at
lunch
as
a
listener
and
was
never
tempted
to
join
in,
until
the
day
one
of
my
friends
mentioned
a
writing
club.
The
first
writing
experience
I
can
remember
happened
during
my
time
as
a
member
of
the
writing
club
for
second
and
third-graders.
I
enjoyed
writing
because
it
gave
me
a
voice
without
having
to
literally
speak.
On
the
first
day
the
monitors
explained
that
we
could
write
about
a
personal
experience
of
our
choice,
and
that
at
the
end
of
the
writing
process
our
stories
would
be
sent
to
a
publisher
so
that
we
would
each
receive
real
hardcover
book
copies
of
our
work.
We
learned
the
reasoning
behind
all
of
the
seemingly
insignificant
pages
in
a
NrealO
book,
and
were
instructed
to
create
a
cover
page
with
a
dedication
to
someone
special
as
well
as
an
autobiography
for
a
page
at
the
end
of
the
book.
Aside
from
brief
lectures
regarding
these
technicalities,
the
writing
was
left
in
the
hands
of
the
students.
For
the
first
few
week
we
worked
on
choosing
topics
and
writing
drafts,
eventually
moved
onto
revising
and
editing
various
papers
by
peers,
created
illustrations
and
chose
colors
and
designs
for
our
book
covers,
and
finally
had
teachers
edit
just
before
publishing.
I
think
this
experience
is
so
memorable
because
it
was
the
first
time
that
I
felt
like
an
authority,
and
that
my
writing
was
significant.
I
was
given
very
little
direction
regarding
a
topic
and
the
adult
members
played
a
very
small
role
in
the
writing
process
as
a
whole,
which
was
very
different
than
the
typical
classroom
setting
I
was
familiar
with.
I
never
considered
the
works
I
produced
at
school
to
be
my
original
creation,
or
an
achievement
to
be
proud
of.
Rather,
it
seemed
more
of
a
given
task,
something
to
be
handed
in
and
graded,
a
mission
to
fulfill
the
requirements
of
my
superior.
I
was
comfortable
with
my
writing
for
school
though;
I
determined
exactly
how
to
please
a
teacher,
and
never
thought
of
writing
as
anything
but
a
liaison
in
order
to
do
so.
At
first,
I
assumed
the
lack
of
adult
involvement
in
the
writing
club
was
simply
a
representation
of
bad
teachers,
and
I
was
nervous
to
work
in
such
unfamiliar
territory.
However,
as
my
writing
progressed
I
began
to
feel
like
the
monitors
trusted
my
judgment
and,
with
that
approval,
I
gained
confidence
in
my
ability
to
write.
This
was
quite
different
than
my
instinctive
reluctance
to
trust
myself,
and
instead
religiously
utilize
the
safety
net
of
the
unlimited
source
of
help
that
my
teacher
was
willing
to
give.
My
newfound
self-assurance
in
writing
not
only
helped
in
writing
better
papers,
but
also
gave
me
the
confidence
to
generate
more
complex
ideas
and
truly
believe
my
ideas
were
worth
hearing.
Though
it
is
crucial
for
a
beginning
writer
to
develop
an
individual
voice
in
order
to
generate
innovative
and
meaningful
works,
this
is
merely
a
step
in
oneOs
journey
toward
gaining
a
firm
grasp
on
the
writing
process.
Throughout
elementary
school,
I
remember
writing
for
various
classes
and
on
various
topics.
Most
of
the
details
of
such
works
are
vague,
but
I
know
that
I
learned
many
specific
NdosO
and
NdonOtsO
in
the
fifth-grade:
NDo
not
say
OIO,O
NA
sentence
does
not
start
with
OandO,O
NUse
commas
to
show
a
pause.O
I
was
also
introduced
to
general
writing
concepts,
and
most
clearly
remember
learning
the
structure
of
a
paragraph:
topic
sentence,
3
supporting
sentences,
and
a
concluding
sentence.
We
repeated
these
elements
aloud
over
and
over
again;
I
knew
they
had
to
be
pretty
important.
In
addition,
we
wrote
in
journals
every
morning
about
a
given
topic
to
put
our
lessons
into
practice.
Our
teacher
rewarded
us
with
a
check
mark
if
we
followed
the
all
the
guidelines
that
were
expected
of
us,
since
we
needed
to
know
how
to
write
a
paragraph
in
order
to
move
on
to
essays
later
in
the
year.
After
some
time,
we
moved
on
to
this
more
complex
endeavor.
We
learned
the
importance
of
the
structure
of
an
essay:
introduction
paragraph,
three
supporting
paragraphs,
and
a
concluding
paragraph.
We
repeated
these
elements
aloud,
over
and
over
and
over
again;
I
knew
they
had
to
be
pretty
important.
We
were
often
quizzed
on
the
process,
and
by
the
time
we
were
asked
to
write
essays
we
had
it
permanently
imprinted
in
our
brains.
I
memorized
perfectly,
but
when
it
came
time
to
write
my
first
research
essay
I
was
mildly
shocked
by
the
difficulty
I
had
in
organizing.
The
extreme
focus
on
format
helped
my
understanding
of
the
way
an
essay
should
be
put
together,
but
my
understanding
was
not
complete.
Since
my
teacher
put
so
much
emphasis
on
it,
I
interpreted
the
structure
as
a
concrete
technique
in
writing.
My
first
research
paper
was
about
an
important
historical
person,
and
in
writing
I
worried
predominantly
about
abiding
by
the
format
I
learned,
which
I
assumed
was
the
only
correct
one
to
use.
Our
lengthy
assignment
sheet
instructed
us
to
include
information
about
the
personOs
childhood
and
upbringing,
education,
favorite
activities,
important
relationships,
accomplishments,
and
any
other
important
facts.
Though
the
assignment
was
clearly
stated
and
I
knew
exactly
what
to
include
and
how
to
form
paragraphs,
I
was
not
yet
able
to
grasp
the
idea
of
transitions
and
I
had
trouble
getting
my
essay
to
flow.
My
first
draft
was
probably
an
absolute
mess,
but
I
included
the
necessary
data
in
the
way
I
was
supposed
to
and
my
teacher
was
definitely
not
unsatisfied.
I
received
few
revision
comments,
mostly
minor
grammar
mistakes
and
a
few
questions
about
paragraph
placement.
I
was
generally
confident
about
writing
my
final
draft,
but
was
unsure
of
how
to
re-organize
my
paper
since
I
followed
the
assignment
sheet
in
its
presentation
of
what
to
include.
I
always
thought
that
I
was
to
follow
my
teacherOs
instructions
as
precisely
as
possible,
leading
to
my
inability
to
think
of
my
paper
in
terms
of
what
I
determined
to
sound
most
coherent.
I
realize
now
that
my
teacher
probably
decided
to
explain
the
importance
of
organization
in
this
specific,
basic
way
because
she
taught
a
very
young
group
of
kids.
However,
the
lesson
would
have
been
more
beneficial
for
me
had
I
understood
the
acceptable
flexibility
that
is
unique
to
the
subject
of
writing.
I
expected
to
receive
the
NAO
that
I
got
on
the
final
draft
since
I
wrote
what
I
was
told
to
write,
and
continued
to
do
well
in
writing
assignments
throughout
the
semester.
Though
I
was
young
and
obviously
not
capable
of
what
I
am
today,
I
assumed
that
I
knew
the
rules
that
would
guide
me
to
write
successfully
in
the
future.
What
I
did
not
know
was
that
I
had
a
lot
to
learn
and
improve,
and
my
assumption
that
writing
could
be
defined
with
a
simple
set
of
rules
and
instructions
was
extremely
premature.
I
entered
high
school
with
the
belief
that
I
was
one
of
the
better
writers
in
my
class
based
on
the
obvious
determinant
that
were
the
grades
I
received
from
teachers
and
report
cards.
By
this
time
I
was
very
confident
in
my
abilities
in
writing
and
as
a
student
generally,
but
still
considered
writing
to
be
more
of
a
chore
than
something
I
created
for
a
purpose.
As
I
learned
to
write
at
a
higher
level,
I
became
more
comfortable
with
transitions
and
gained
an
understanding
of
how
to
make
an
essay
flow.
I
became
more
comfortable
with
writing
with
a
unique
style
and
developing
a
voice
of
my
own,
and
started
to
realize
the
need
for
occasionally
Nbreaking
the
rulesO
of
writing
that
I
had
so
loyally
followed
for
many
years
prior.
Nevertheless,
my
thinking
was
still
too
sheltered
to
allow
me
to
truly
understand
how
to
write
for
a
purpose
that
was
important
to
me.
The
way
I
thought
about
writing,
and
the
way
I
wrote,
began
to
mature
in
eleventh-grade,
during
my
time
in
a
College
Writing
course
offered
at
my
school.
I
remember
meeting
my
teacher
on
the
first
day,
and
her
overwhelming
enthusiasm
in
her
discussion
of
her
lessons
that
awaited
us
in
the
future.
Her
overbearing
voice,
high
expectations,
and
utter
excitement
seemed
outlandish
and
just
plain
silly,
since
at
the
time,
I
could
not
fathom
her
over-the-top
reaction
to
what
I
considered,
plainly,
a
standard
topic
that
I
would
have
to
do
homework
for
at
school.
As
I
sat
through
class
day
after
day,
I
started
to
realize
that
I
was
having
fun
and
actually
learning
(not
memorizing),
and
that
maybe
this
teacher
was
not
so
crazy
after
all.
My
teacherOs
enthusiasm
was
definitely
the
aspect
of
class
that
sticks
out
in
my
mind.
We
had
root
word
quizzes
every
Thursday,
and
my
teacher
never
failed
to
dance
around
the
room
and
sing
her
root
word
song
(NSpell
the
word,
define
the
word,
carry
the
root,
define
the
root!O)
each
week,
occasionally
forcing
the
class
to
join
in
and
assign
solos
to
those
who
seemed
bored.
Her
enthusiasm
made
me
feel
obligated
to
do
my
part
as
a
student,
and
I
never
neglected
work
for
her
class.
I
remember
receiving
my
first
paper
back
and,
along
with
it,
my
first
B-.
Though
initially
distraught,
the
teacher
announced
that
half
of
the
class
failed
and
that
no
one
in
the
class
received
an
A,
but
also
explained
that
as
a
whole
we
did
better
than
she
expected
and
told
us
not
to
worry
about
our
grades.
I
was
certainly
not
used
to
this
type
of
response
to
my
work.
I
was
certainly
not
used
to
not
worrying
about
my
grades.
My
grades
were
the
point
of
school
to
me;
they
were
what
determined
my
intellectual
ability.
I
quickly
figured
out
that
I
was
going
to
have
to
adapt
to
this
way
of
thinking,
and
that
I
was
going
to
have
a
run
for
my
money.
This
was
the
first
class
that
I
did
not
succeed
in
easily,
and
the
first
time
that
I
was
motivated
to
take
the
course
seriously;
I
was
determined
to
become
a
better
writer
and
get
the
grade
that
was
typically
a
given.
One
of
my
most
memorable
assignments
from
that
class
was
given
around
the
middle
of
the
year.
We
were
told
to
write
two
papers,
both
aiming
to
describe
a
picture.
In
the
first
paper
we
were
to
describe
using
an
objective
voice,
and
in
the
second
we
used
a
subjective
voice.
This
was
something
I
had
never
been
asked
to
do,
and
I
was
surprised
at
how
difficult
it
was
to
write
objectively,
without
exuding
any
type
of
opinion
or
bias.
I
worked
on
those
papers
for
longer
than
I
had
ever
worked
on
an
assignment
before
(which
is
not
saying
much),
I
went
in
for
extra
help
during
lunch,
and
ended
up
getting
the
highest
grade
in
the
class.
On
that
day
I
felt
proud
of
what
I
had
done,
as
opposed
to
my
usual
lack
of
emotion
regarding
any
work
I
did
in
school.
Though
I
had
become
used
to,
and
sick
of,
receiving
high
BOs
in
the
class,
my
teacherOs
comments
always
made
me
feel
like
she
knew
I
could
do
better
and
truly
believed
that
my
writing
was
legitimate.
I
respected
this
teacher
for
her
devotion
to
her
students
and
obvious
vast
knowledge
and
love
of
the
English
language.
She
never
did
much
marking
on
the
papers
anyone
handed
in,
but
always
included
a
synopsis
at
the
end
of
the
paper
to
explain
key
problem
areas
to
work
on.
She
kept
our
class
on
our
toes
with
her
strict
yet
effective
rules
of
the
class,
and
her
unwavering
dissatisfaction
with
average
work.
She
knew
that
I
was
not
working
to
my
potential
and
was
the
first
teacher
that
would
not
accept
it.
Soon
after,
I
began
not
to
accept
it
either.
I
was
introduced
to
creative
writing
in
her
class
at
the
end
of
the
year,
and
had
to
re-write
the
ending
to
a
book
we
read
in
class.
We
had
to
work
with
partners,
and
unfortunately
my
partner
decided
to
disappear
the
day
after
the
work
was
assigned.
I
did
not
mention
her
absence
to
my
teacher,
and
went
ahead
to
do
my
assignment
alone.
When
I
got
the
assignment
back,
I
received
a
A+,
which
was
the
best
grade
I
had
ever
received
in
the
class.
The
assignment
was
long
and
tedious,
but
I
gained
a
new
confidence
and
respect
for
myself
as
writer
when
my
hard
work
paid
off.
I
discovered
my
passion
for
creative
writing,
and
realized
my
ability
to
write
without
any
guidelines
or
constraints,
using
material
that
came
solely
from
my
own
mind.
I
feel
that
I
did
not
truly
understand
begin
to
understand
the
writing
process
until
my
eleventh-grade
class,
and
I
consider
that
the
starting
point
of
my
love
for
writing.
My
high
school
was
very
small,
public,
and
offered
no
AP
classes,
so
upon
entering
Lafayette
I
was
very
intimidated.
I
was
not
used
to
the
workload
that
I
faced
at
college,
nor
was
I
used
to
working
on
an
assignment
for
more
than
a
few
days.
I
struggled
in
writing
classes
freshmen
year
and
was
placed
in
classes
with
some
of
the
toughest
professors,
and
I
had
trouble
managing
my
time.
However,
I
feel
that
I
have
met
many
brilliant
people
during
my
time
thus
far
at
Lafayette,
all
of
whom
have
pushed
me
to
write
at
a
higher
level.
I
have
realized
I
stopped
improving
during
high
school
because
I
never
felt
pressure
to
do
better.
I
was
stuck
in
a
routine
of
doing
the
same
work
IOd
been
doing,
and
receiving
good
grades
easily.
Lafayette
College
has
forced
me
to
raise
my
expectations
for
myself,
and
realize
that
I
still
have
plenty
to
learn.
