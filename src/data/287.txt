WA
Workshop
Essay
Story
of
Myself
I
would
love
to
tell
you
that
my
history
as
a
writer
is
one
big
grandiose
story--beginning
with
a
child
prodigy
and
ending
here,
as
a
WA
at
Lafayette
College.
Unfortunately,
that's
not
the
case,
and
I
will
try
to
explain
why.
Unlike
most
others
in
my
age
group,
I
actually
had
a
tremendous
amount
of
difficulty
with
writing,
right
up
until
freshman
year
of
college.
Attaining
the
ranks
of
a
"good
writer"
was
a
long,
painstaking
effort
that
oftentimes
sent
my
mind
tumbling
into
a
realm
of
negative,
self-defeating
emotions.
However,
there
apparently
was
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel--this
becoming
evident
once
I
discovered
that
I
actually
enjoyed
writing.
This
has
indeed
been
quite
the
revelation;
it
has
since
then
been
the
driving
force
in
a
fairly
rapid
shift
towards
a
more
English-oriented
major.
Honestly
though,
I
still
don't
know
exactly
what
happened,
or
rather,
why
such
a
sudden
change
occurred
at
the
time
that
it
did.
In
any
case,
it
all
started
a
long
time
ago...
I
can
clearly
recall
the
first
time
that
I
actually
had
to
write
something.
I
was
five,
in
Preschool,
and
had
an
unquestionable
obsession
with
dinosaurs.
One
day,
my
teacher
told
the
class
that
we
were
all
required
to
literally
construct
a
story--bindings,
cover,
pages,
and
the
writing
within.
We
were
granted
the
freedom
to
write
about
anything
that
our
little
hearts
desired.
So,
naturally
I
chose
dinosaurs.
Considering
that
I
had
never
previously
written
anything,
I
remember
receiving
considerable
help
from
my
mother.
I
was,
however,
quite
adept
at
drawing
my
own
pictures.
In
those
days,
drawing
(scribbling)
from
scratch
was
much
preferred
to
coloring
within
the
lines.
Two
weeks
or
fifty
minutes
of
real
work
later,
I
had
my
story.
I
can
remember
that
my
story
was
certainly
one
of
the
most
interesting,
but
unfortunately,
far
from
being
the
most
skillfully
written.
And
so
this
is
where
it
all
began,
as,
without
a
doubt,
this
little
tremor
was
a
clear
precursor
to
my
upcoming
hardships
as
a
writer.
By
the
time
second
grade
at
Sol
Feinstone
Elementary
School
rolled
around,
it
was
clear
to
those
who
knew
me
that
writing
was
obviously
not
my
academic
forte.
Beyond
the
sub-par
assignments,
it
was
becoming
apparent
that
I
was
just
incapable
of
reading
and
writing
beyond
a
snail's
pace.
As
a
result,
I
was
removed
from
regular
reading
and
writing
classes
and
placed
into
a
sort
of
learning
skills
program.
My
teacher
was
a
very
sweet
young
lady
by
the
name
of
Miss
Love.
She
assured
me
that
I
would
fit
right
in
with
the
rest
of
the
group.
For
a
while
things
seemed
to
be
going
well.
My
skills
were
finally
up
to
par
with
the
rest
of
my
class
and
I
no
longer
felt
so
uneasy
about
reading
aloud
in
class.
With
regards
to
my
writing,
progress
was
a
bit
slower
than
with
the
reading,
but
was
still
moving
in
a
positive
direction.
In
any
case,
due
to
the
lack
of
significant
progress
in
any
one
area,
I
would
remain
hear
until
my
fourth
grade
year.
By
the
time
fourth
grade
got
underway,
I
was
still
enrolled
in
the
learning
skills
program.
However,
this
was
soon
to
be
radically
altered,
unquestionably
by
god
himself.
When
students
reach
the
fourth
grade
level
in
Pennsylvania,
they
are
required
to
take
a
statewide
multiple
choice
examination,
known
as
the
CTBS.
There
are
numerous
sections
encompassing
material
from
all
major
subject
areas,
in
much
the
same
manner
the
ACT
tests
students
planning
to
attend
college.
The
purpose
of
the
CTBS,
as
far
as
I
can
remember,
is
to
take
a
brief
look
at
where
each
student
stands
against
others
in
the
state,
with
regards
to
each
particular
subject
area.
As
none
of
my
classmates
or
I
had
ever
taken
a
standardized
test
before,
no
one
knew
quite
what
to
expect.
I
am
unable
to
say
exactly
how
I
felt
at
the
time,
but
I
would
assume
that
I
was
not
especially
jubilant
when
the
test
proctor
noted
that
there
would
be
a
section
on
reading
comprehension
and
writing
skills.
Despite
the
trauma
I
was
about
to
incur,
I
sat
up
straight
and
proceeded
to
fill
in
the
circles
for
my
name:
Z,
A,
C...
A
couple
of
weeks
later
my
teacher
announced
to
the
class
that
our
scores
had
arrived.
Joy!
I
can
remember
slouching
in
my
seat
while
the
rest
of
those
at
my
table
hung
on
to
the
edge
of
their
seats
in
anticipation.
Ironically,
most
of
this
excitement
was
instantly
converted
to
uncertainty
when
the
teacher
notified
us
that
our
scores
were
being
sent
directly
to
our
parents.
"Wonderful,"
I
thought
to
myself.
Now
my
parents
would
get
to
see
first-hand
how
I
matched
up
against
everyone
else.
Strangely
enough,
when
I
got
home
they
did
not
say
a
word.
At
first
I
was
a
little
nervous
and
somewhat
wary,
but
after
a
while,
I
began
to
wonder
if
maybe
things
hadn't
turned
out
as
a
badly
as
I
had
previously
anticipated.
As
luck
would
have
it,
I
was
not
punished
for
disgracing
the
family
name,
and
was
therefore
allowed
to
spend
the
night
at
a
friend's
house.
That's
about
the
time
that
a
bright
mishap
occurred
in
my
rather
bland
history
as
a
child
writer.
The
next
morning
my
friend
had
a
little
pool
party
and
everybody
went
swimming.
As
was
customary
in
those
days,
a
hot
day
out
at
the
pool
required
the
coldest
refreshments
around,
specifically
chocolate
popsicles.
My
friend's
father
handed
everyone
a
popsicle,
then
came
back
to
me.
I
felt
as
though
I
was
about
to
be
blamed
for
something
that
I
had
not
done.
All
the
while
he
was
holding
another
popsicle
in
his
hand.
"Congratulations
on
your
reading
and
writing
scores!"
he
said.
"You
were
one
of
only
a
handful
of
people
in
the
whole
state
to
get
a
perfect
score!"
I
was
bit
little
confused,
but
one
thing
was
for
sure,
I
wanted
that
damn
popsicle.
I
would
say
that
the
shock
of
that
moment
was
a
little
larger
than
life,
but
the
popsicle
certainly
helped
keep
things
under
control.
I
went
home
that
evening
and
asked
my
parents
about
my
scores.
I
honestly
can't
remember
anyone
in
my
family
making
a
big
deal
out
of
it
at
the
time.
Things
at
school
were
apparently
a
little
different,
however,
as
soon
after
I
was
removed
from
the
learning
skills
reading
group.
I
still
wonder
to
this
day
whether
or
not
that
had
been
the
best
choice.
In
spite
of
what
might
have
been
overlooked,
I
was
thrown
back
into
general
ranks.
As
the
years
progressed,
my
ability
to
write
would
have
a
tough
time
keeping
pace.
Junior
high
was
when
I
pretty
much
hit
rock
bottom.
My
most
common
marks
on
tests
and
writing
assignments
were
D's
and
F's,
with
the
occasional
C
or
B
here
and
there.
Yes,
"D"
is
for
"delightful"
and
"F"
is
for
"fantastic."
Grammar
was
by
far
the
worst.
In
fact,
I
am
not
sure
that
I
learned
a
single
thing
in
eighth
grade
grammar
class;
only
god
knows
how
I
managed
to
pass!
Coincidentally,
I
am
unable
to
recollect
any
assignments
or
hardships
that
I
had
at
that
time.
I
can,
however,
vividly
remember
an
assignment
that
I
had
in
ninth
grade.
My
English
teacher
was
Mr.
Coal,
and
he
was
one
tough
customer
(Former
MP,
he
ran
afternoon
detention).
The
specific
assignment
in
mind
consisted
of
gathering
multiple
works
from
any
one
poet
or
writer.
Our
task
was
to
write
a
three-page
biography
and
present
a
brief
analysis
of
the
works
that
we
had
chosen.
I
remember
this
assignment,
not
because
I
remember
getting
a
C+
as
the
grade,
but
because
I
remember
putting
some
effort
into
it,
which
was
recognized
and
hence
praised
by
the
teacher.
I
can
specifically
recall
that
this
assignment
got
me
up
when
I
was
feeling
a
little
down.
As
was
my
luck
with
writing,
though,
this
aura
of
positive
emotions
was
rather
ephemeral.
In
the
end,
reality
held
true
and
I
continued
to
write
crappy
papers
for
the
rest
of
the
year.
High
school
did
not
start
out
much
different,
except
for
the
fact
that
it
was
a
different
school.
My
writing
improved
slightly,
and
I
finally
managed
to
obtain
better
marks
overall.
This
was
quite
the
change
as
I
began
to
perform
better
academically
in
all
subject
areas.
The
highlight
of
it
all
was
that,
for
the
first
time,
I
was
finally
making
the
honor
role.
All
other
subject
areas
aside,
I
was
still
having
a
somewhat
difficult
time
with
writing,
though
there
were
the
occasional
but
obvious
signs
of
improvement.
The
tenth
grade
was
the
first
year
that
I
actually
began
to
pay
serious
attention
to
my
schoolwork.
English
at
this
level
was
more
focused
on
reading
and
writing,
with
far
less
influence
on
grammar.
I
suppose
teachers
felt
that
at
this
point
their
students
would
already
have
a
general
foundation
in
grammar.
Whether
or
not
this
foundation
was
solid
would
soon
be
discovered.
As
was
the
case,
most
of
the
work
in
this
class
involved
reading
comprehension,
after
which
an
assignment
would
be
given
asking
each
student
to
explain
in
detail
what
he
or
she
had
just
read.
And
so,
I
jumped
from
one
hot
pot
into
the
next;
I
just
could
not
win
with
English.
The
worst
thing
about
the
tenth
grade
was
that
my
teacher
apparently
had
a
thing
with
Shakespeare.
Shakespeare
to
me
was
like
reading
Chinese,
and
writing
about
it
was
nearly
impossible.
So,
when
asked
to
write
a
short
essay
on
one
of
the
scenes,
I
successfully
lobbied
the
class,
and
ultimately
the
teacher,
into
acting
out
the
scenes
in
a
series
of
short
skits.
It's
not
that
I
despised
writing--I
just
despised
writing
about
Shakespeare.
So,
naturally
I
was
glad
that
most
of
what
we
dealt
with
in
class
was
not
related
to
William
Shakespeare.
Unfortunately,
it
was
in
doing
these
other
assignments
that
I
began
to
notice
something,
something
awful--that
my
writing
was
still
lagging
behind
the
rest
of
my
age
group,
somewhere
around
the
eighth
grade
level,
if
that!
This
was
completely
depressing,
and
I
knew
that
it
would
be
a
problem
if
I
wanted
to
gain
ground
in
the
hopes
of
entering
a
decent
college
or
university.
In
spite
of
it
all,
I
decided
to
soldier
on
into
unforgiving
waters--AP
American
Studies.
As
a
result
of
having
a
B-
average
after
the
tenth
grade
year,
I
was
granted
permission
by
the
dean
to
enter
into
an
advanced
history/writing
class.
There
was
no
doubt
in
anyone's
mind
that
this
course
was
the
slayer
of
giants,
and
I
was
by
no
means
any
giant
in
the
land
of
academia.
Fortunately,
this
class
involved
more
reading
than
writing.
However,
the
writing
it
did
entail
was
rather
challenging,
considering
that
we
had
to
write
about
contemporary
readings
from
writers
such
as
Whitman,
Emerson,
Thoreau
and
many
others.
The
assignment
that
I
most
clearly
remember
dealt
with
a
poem
by
Walt
Whitman
titled
"Song
of
Myself."
Our
assignment
was
rather
basic:
Write
your
own
"Song
of
Myself."
The
tough
part
about
this
was
that
I
had
never
really
dealt
with
any
contemporary
American
poetry.
I
gave
it
my
all,
though,
and
turned
out
a
surprisingly
good
"Song
of
Myself."
I
discovered
that
I
really
liked
this
type
of
assignment
because
it
had
about
it
a
certain
inherent
freedom;
the
boundaries
were
very
thin,
which
in
turn
fostered
immense
creativity
in
the
way
that
I
constructed
my
paper.
It
was
in
this
assignment
that
I
found
I
actually
enjoyed
writing.
Twelfth
grade--my
senior
year
of
high
school.
I
found
myself
once
again
amongst
those
in
my
class
who
excelled
in
English.
AP
English
was
a
bit
different
from
junior
year
in
that
everything
in
this
class
dealt
strictly
with
English.
The
work
was
more
challenging,
more
intense,
and
dealt
with
largest
stockpile
of
poetry
yet.
I
can
tell
you
that
I
felt
way
out
of
my
league
on
the
first
day
of
that
class,
especially
when
our
teacher,
Mr.Cabot,
walked
into
the
room.
That
man
had
a
reputation
for
being
a
tough
teacher.
However,
as
time
would
show,
things
did
not
turn
out
all
that
bad
after
all.
As
anyone
could
have
guessed,
poetry
was
not
my
strong
point
in
this
class.
My
classmates
and
I
were
incessantly
drilled
in
reading
and
writing
comprehension.
Every
week
we
were
given
a
piece
of
poetry
or
prose
to
read
outside
of
class.
We
were
required
to
write
an
essay
explaining
all
that
we
could
decipher
about
it.
On
a
grade
scale
of
one
to
ten
(ten
being
the
best),
I
averaged
a
five
or
six
throughout
the
year
on
my
papers,
which
was
not
that
bad
considering
most
everyone
got
between
a
five
and
eight
on
any
given
paper.
My
test
scores
were
just
under
par
with
the
rest
of
the
class,
but
that
didn't
phase
me
too
much.
In
fact,
one
day
I
was
so
determined
to
understand
poetry,
I
actually
wrote
a
poem
myself.
My
teacher
looked
pretty
impressed
when
I
showed
it
to
him
the
next
day.
Aside
from
the
effort
outside
of
the
class,
my
effort
in
class
was
more
than
apparent.
I
spent
countless
hours
that
year
in
my
teacher's
office
reviewing
class
material
and
my
own
papers.
In
the
end,
I
ended
up
with
a
B
in
the
class
and
a
shabby
score
on
the
AP
exam.
I
felt
miserable,
until
one
day
when
we
had
a
special
awards
assembly.
In
some
strange
twist
of
fate,
I
ended
up
getting
the
AP
English
Award
for
that
year.
At
first,
I
thought
that
it
was
some
sick
joke,
considering
how
much
I
struggled
throughout
the
course
of
the
year.
Then
I
realized
something--I
was
getting
the
award
because
of
my
work
ethic,
rather
than
for
the
raw
talent
that
I
certainly
did
not
possess.
What
a
way
to
end
such
a
tough
career
in
English.
"Thank
god
for
college!"
I
said
to
myself.
"Just
one
or
two
more
English
classes
to
go!"
How
sorely
mistaken
I
was.
I
had
never
felt
so
small
in
any
English
class
as
that
first
day
I
walked
into
my
FYS.
Oh
man,
I
felt
like
I
was
making
a
huge
mistake
and
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
everyone
(including
the
teacher)
realized
just
how
bad
I
really
was
at
English.
The
shit
really
hit
the
fan
when
my
teacher
walked
into
the
room
and
announced
his
plans
for
our
class.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
noticed
that
I
was
not
the
only
one
slouching
down
in
my
seat.
Still,
this
offered
little
comfort.
So,
I
did
what
I
did
in
senior
year
of
high
school--I
talked
to
the
professor
during
office
hours
and
prepared
to
bite
the
bullet.
However,
there
was
one
thing
that
was
definitely
in
my
favor.
The
first
assignment
in
this
class
struck
a
lost
chord
in
my
mind,
or
maybe
created
a
new
one,
I'm
not
quite
certain.
In
any
event,
I
did
a
really
nice
job
on
my
first
paper
and
was
given
a
B+.
I
was
absolutely
shocked--Not
only
had
I
heard
that
this
particular
teacher
was
a
bit
rough
on
the
new
kids,
some
of
the
other
student's
grades
certainly
supported
the
notion!
I
soon
discovered,
however,
that
this
was
no
fluke;
I
actually
enjoyed
writing.
As
to
what
brought
about
the
change,
I
may
never
know
exactly
what
is
was,
even
to
this
day.
College
writing
and
VAST
were
repeats
of
FYS,
though
in
some
ways
different.
I
was
fortunate
enough
in
getting
the
classes
that
I
wanted.
My
main
goal
was
simply
to
improve
my
writing,
and
I
worked
very
hard
at
achieving
this.
My
grades
continued
to
improve,
up
to
the
point
where
I
was
consistently
obtaining
the
highest
grades
in
my
class.
Not
only
that,
but
people
were
actually
calling
me
up
so
that
I
might
better
help
them
understand
the
assignments!
My
whole
English
career
reached
its
peak
when
my
teacher
asked
me
during
spring
semester
freshman
year
if
I
would
ever
consider
pursuing
the
WA
position.
It
seemed
like
one
big
surprise
after
another,
and
this
was
certainly
the
icing
on
the
cake.
I
would
have
to
say
that
my
experiences
with
English
in
college
have
most
definitely
helped
me
to
become
a
more
confident
and
skilled
writer.
So,
we
come
to
the
point
at
which
I
stand
now,
writing
a
summer
essay
for
the
WA
program.
I
am
still
baffled,
looking
back,
at
the
sheer
amount
of
progress
that
I
made
in
such
a
short
time
span.
I
went
from
being
the
poorest
writer
in
my
class
to
one
of
the
best,
all
the
while
wondering
whether
or
not
this
was
all
just
some
passing
phase,
and
at
what
point
I
would
revert
back
to
being
my
old
self
again.
That's
just
it
though--I
learned
that
it's
not
such
much
about
being
a
decent
writer
as
being
a
confident
writer.
You
can
always
improve
the
actual
skill
level
at
which
you
write.
Confidence,
however,
is
a
much
more
difficult
power
to
conquer--one
that
requires
you
believe
in
yourself,
regardless
of
what
you
might
otherwise
think.
Maybe
I
wasn't
such
a
bad
writer
after
all
these
years;
maybe
I
just
needed
the
right
environment
in
which
to
blossom.
