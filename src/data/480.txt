RETURNING
WRITING
ASSOCIATES
I
entered
the
WA
program
the
fall
semester
of
2004
not
knowing
what
to
expect.
But
now
that
I
reflect
on
my
experiences,
I
only
have
good
things
to
say
about
the
position.
Being
a
WA
taught
me
a
lot
about
my
abilities
as
a
writer.
When
looking
back
at
my
comment
sheets
I
filled
out
for
each
student,
I
realized
that
the
problems
they
were
having
were
comparable
to
errors
I
made
in
my
writing
as
well.
Such
problems
concerned
the
citation
of
authors
and
page
numbers,
the
clarity
of
the
paper
as
a
whole,
the
importance
of
analyzing
quotes,
and
superfluous
information
that
did
not
relate
back
to
the
thesis.
Through
the
constant
practice
of
reading
through
students'
papers
and
thinking
of
ways
to
improve
them,
it
became
easy
for
me
to
objectively
read
through
my
own
compositions
and
edit
them
more
quickly
and
effectively.
In
addition
to
this
constant
practice,
the
friendly
and
helpful
environment
my
coworkers
created
was
very
beneficial
for
me.
Feedback
and
advice
were
readily
available
from
other
Writing
Assistants
during
my
breaks
between
conferences
and
I
even
offered
some
of
my
own
suggestions
to
the
other
WAs
when
asked
for
my
input.
Moreover,
the
weekly
staff
meetings
were
also
very
constructive.
In
the
staff
meetings,
the
most
important
thing
I
learned
was
how
to
suggest
changes
to
students
and
meanwhile
keep
an
open
mind
to
their
explanations
instead
of
just
correcting
their
mistakes.
In
addition,
because
these
meetings
were
held
once
a
week,
the
suggestions
I
took
from
them
would
be
fresh
in
my
mind
when
I
had
my
student
conferences.
Being
a
WA
was
also
personally
rewarding.
I
was
lucky
because
all
of
my
students
were
respectful
and
listened
to
what
I
had
to
say.
Some
were
more
receptive
than
others
to
my
suggestions,
but
to
my
knowledge,
all
of
them
showed
a
great
amount
of
improvement
academically
throughout
the
semester.
Their
grades
and
especially
the
noticeable
advancement
in
their
writing
made
me
proud
to
say
that
I
was
their
Writing
Assistant.
The
most
gratifying
part
of
the
job
was
the
sincere
compliments
I
received
from
a
number
of
students.
Two
people
told
me
that
they
really
appreciated
my
help,
and
they
liked
that
I
always
pointed
out
something
for
them
to
improve
on,
even
if
their
papers
appeared
flawless.
In
addition
to
these
two
students,
at
least
5
other
students
came
up
to
me
at
the
end
of
the
semester
and
thanked
me
for
assisting
them
in
their
writing--they
were
very
happy
with
their
final
grades
in
their
FYS
and
felt
I
was
to
some
extent
responsible.
Despite
that
I
had
an
overall
good
experience,
there
were
a
few
unforeseen
obstacles
that
I
had
to
overcome
in
this
position.
One
of
my
students
was
from
Africa
and
had
a
lot
of
trouble
understanding
the
basic
format
of
college
papers.
As
a
result,
he
would
continuously
receive
a
lot
of
criticism
from
the
professor.
The
student
came
to
me
very
frustrated,
and
I
found
myself
having
to
repeat
grammatical
concepts
more
than
once
until
he
understood
them.
Because
he
had
so
many
grammar
difficulties,
I
spent
extra
time
helping
him
edit
his
papers,
but
I
made
sure
not
to
just
give
him
the
answers.
It
was
more
time
than
I
had
planned
to
put
in,
more
than
the
required
WA
hours,
but
it
was
worth
it
because
he
came
back
and
thanked
me
for
helping
get
him
a
good
grade
in
the
class.
Another
obstacle
I
encountered
was
the
lack
of
respect
one
student
failed
to
give
me
as
far
as
meeting
times
were
concerned.
Her
busy
schedule
caused
unpredicted
conflicts
and
resulted
in
having
to
change
my
whole
schedule.
That
was
understandable
because
I
realize
we
are
all
students
and
are
involved
on
campus.
However,
I
would
have
liked
to
have
been
notified
earlier.
To
make
matters
worse,
she
didnOt
even
show
up
for
her
rescheduled
meeting.
When
I
called
her
extension,
it
seemed
she
had
forgotten
(this
wasnOt
the
first
time)
and
came
an
hour
late
because
she
Nhad
to
shower.O
Luckily
there
was
another
student
who
had
an
appointment
with
me
before
the
late
studentOs
scheduled
time.
I
spent
an
additional
half
hour
with
the
first
student
so
the
time
was
not
completely
wasted.
When
the
girl
did
finally
arrive
she
acted
as
if
she
did
nothing
wrong.
I
was
very
annoyed
by
this
behavior,
but
was
patient
enough
to
help
her
with
the
outline
she
presented.
I
also
made
it
a
point
to
tell
her
that
I
could
have
left
before
she
came,
as
WAs
are
only
required
to
stay
15
minutes
into
our
scheduled
meeting
if
the
student
does
not
show
up.
Finally,
a
third
student
challenged
me
like
no
other
student
has
in
my
life.
Her
writing
skills
seemed
to
dwarf
mine
and
she
knew
it.
The
only
corrections
I
could
think
of
were
small
errors
in
grammar
or
spelling
because
the
content,
structure,
and
arguments
were
explained
extremely
well.
It
was
obvious
that
she
had
done
reading
outside
of
her
class
and
always
came
up
with
her
own
essay
topics
that
none
of
the
other
students
in
her
FYS
thought
of.
When
reading
her
papers
and
speaking
with
her,
I
was
able
to
see
the
grand
difference
between
student
writers.
She
had
the
ability
to
think
outside
of
the
box
when
coming
up
with
paper
topics.
This
is
turn
helped
me
understand
what
a
perfect
paper
for
this
particular
professor
looked
like
and
in
general
how
refreshed
teachers
feel
when
reading
a
paper
with
a
unique
new
topic.
When
I
saw
my
writers
in
conference,
I
drew
on
my
past
editing
history
including
my
AP
Grammar
credit,
being
in
an
FYS
and
VAST,
and
my
work
in
other
writing
intensive
courses.
I
also
relied
on
the
content
in
the
staff
meetings
that
we
discussed
and
the
beginning
training
seminar
we
had
in
the
fall
for
all
WAs.
In
addition
to
all
of
this
experience,
there
are
lessons
I
have
learned
in
the
spring
and
this
summer
that
I
believe
will
aid
me
in
doing
a
better
job
this
fall
compared
with
last
year.
Because
I
studied
and
lived
in
Spain
for
a
semester,
I
know
how
difficult
it
is
to
write
a
paper
in
a
second
language
(especially
papers
for
native
Spanish
professors).
All
of
my
six
classes
were
completely
in
Spanish
and
all
of
our
tests
were
in
an
essay
format.
Needless
to
say,
I
did
not
get
a
break
from
writing
in
spring
of
2005.
From
when
I
arrived
to
when
I
departed
Spain,
I
made
great
improvements
in
my
writing
especially
with
grammar.
But
I
remember
struggling
in
the
beginning
because
the
rules
didnOt
seem
logical
to
me.
Also,
it
was
a
problem
because
some
of
the
Spanish
grammar
rules
were
not
easily
translated
into
English
or
an
English
grammar
rule
that
conflicted
with
those
of
Spain.
This
dilemma
brought
me
back
to
the
memory
with
the
student
from
Africa
and
his
struggle
with
English
grammar.
Now
I
understand
where
he
was
coming
from
and
was
able
to
sympathize
with
his
frustration.
This
summer,
in
the
absence
of
a
lot
of
my
good
friends,
I
got
a
job
as
an
EXCEL
Scholar
and
I
ended
up
getting
close
to
a
lot
of
international
students.
This
required
me
to
live
on
campus
from
June
13th
to
August
12th.
Luckily
I
was
placed
randomly
into
a
court
with
three
girls
I
had
met
in
the
past,
but
only
knew
them
as
acquaintances.
One
of
them
was
from
Argentina
and
the
other
from
Morocco.
Before
I
knew
it,
they
were
inviting
me
to
go
out
with
them,
and
I
even
met
a
student
from
Greece
who
had
graduated
in
the
spring.
Soon,
I
met
someone
from
Ethiopia,
another
from
Bulgaria,
and
finally
another
from
Paraguay.
The
list
goes
on,
but
the
point
is
that
I
was
the
minority
when
we
spent
time
together.
I
really
appreciate
the
fact
that
I
met
them
and
spent
so
much
time
with
them.
I
enjoyed
their
company
and
especially
their
input
on
America
and
how
their
experiences
in
their
native
countries
differed
from
those
here.
After
becoming
very
close
to
these
students,
I
feel
IOll
be
able
to
relate
to
international
students
better
than
I
did
before.
After
my
experiences
(listed
above)
and
now
that
I
consider
myself
knowledgeable
about
the
position
and
what
to
expect,
there
are
some
techniques
that
I
would
like
to
improve
on
next
year.
First,
I
would
like
to
communicate
with
the
professor
more,
asking
questions
about
the
assignment,
relaying
student
questions
to
the
professor,
and
taking
the
position
as
the
liaison
between
both
parties.
This
is
important
because
by
understanding
what
the
professor
wants,
students
will
be
better
able
to
meet
the
professorOs
expectations.
I
know
the
WA
I
had
for
my
FYS
asked
our
professor
a
fair
number
of
questions
for
us,
and
it
was
very
helpful.
I
also
plan
to
have
more
patience
with
the
students
who
show
up
to
a
conference
with
an
outline
or
just
one
paragraph
written,
and
be
more
willing
to
help
them
with
whatever
they
give
me.
I
realize
now
that
coming
to
the
conference
with
even
a
small
part
of
the
assignment
is
better
than
not
attending
at
all.
In
the
same
sentiment,
I
will
also
attempt
to
find
a
better
balance
between
being
helpful
and
being
taken
advantage
of.
One
example
of
this
is
the
problem
of
late
papers
(I
was
not
able
to
peruse
and
edit
them
beforehand)
which
I
hope
to
prevent.
I
intend
to
do
this
by
asking
the
professor
to
collect
the
papers
from
all
of
the
students
on
a
certain
date,
and
then
leaving
them
in
his/her
mailbox.
This
way,
it
will
not
be
left
up
to
the
students
to
place
the
papers
in
my
box
and
I
will
be
able
to
read
all
of
the
papers
beforehand
because
they
will
be
handed
in
on
time.
Finally,
I
will
familiarize
myself
with
the
books
the
students
are
reading
in
the
class.
This
way
the
time
during
their
meetings
will
not
be
taken
up
by
a
spoken
summary
of
the
book
they
wrote
their
papers
about
to
aid
my
understanding
of
their
argument.
More
time
will
be
spent
on
editing.
As
for
advice
for
new
WAs,
I
discovered
two
things
that
proved
to
be
very
effective
for
this
position.
The
first
is
positive
reinforcement.
Make
sure
you
always
praise
something
in
the
writerOs
paper
even
if
there
are
a
considerable
amount
of
errors.
Not
only
will
this
raise
their
self-esteem
and
put
you
in
good
standing
so
they
will
respect
you
in
the
future,
but
it
will
also
cause
them
to
work
harder
if
they
have
something
as
an
example
in
their
paper
to
work
from.
I
know
personally
I
would
be
less
likely
to
fix
all
of
my
mistakes
if
the
paper
was
covered
in
red
comments
and
cross-outs
and
no
encouraging
messages
were
found.
IOm
sure
you
feel
the
same
way.
The
other
idea
is
to
ask
the
students
what
their
papers
are
about.
Despite
that
you
already
read
them,
and
have
somewhat
of
an
idea,
this
will
cause
them
to
share
their
main
ideas
with
you
(probably
the
thesis).
You
can
find
out
how
much
they
really
understood
the
assignment
and
if
theyOre
confident
in
their
arguments.
If
they
are
a
bit
confused,
you
can
explain
what
the
professor
is
looking
for.
I
wasnOt
fortunate
enough
to
work
with
a
professor
helpful
in
this
way
because
his
assignments
were
always
free
writes.
So
instead,
I
judged
a
particular
paper
against
other
papers
I
read
from
the
students
in
class.
This
way,
I
could
see
who
was
on
the
right
track,
and
who
needed
help.
If
the
student
was
still
wary
about
their
thesis,
I
helped
them
brainstorm
better
more
developed
theses
ideas.
I
have
learned
a
great
amount
since
I
was
a
WA
in
the
fall
of
last
year,
and
I
am
very
excited
to
apply
my
new-found
knowledge
to
the
position
this
year.
