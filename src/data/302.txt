The
History
of
My
Writing
For
as
long
as
I
can
remember
I
have
loved
to
write.
I
have
forever
yearned
to
make
writing
an
important
part
of
my
life.
This
year,
with
my
acceptance
into
the
WA
program,
I
feel
as
though
this
goal
has
become
more
realistic
than
ever.
From
the
days
before
I
knew
my
alphabet
to
practicing
for
ever
Friday's
spelling
test
in
grade
school,
all
the
way
to
lengthy
and
complicated
research
papers
for
300-level
college
courses,
my
writing
has
clearly
come
a
long
way.
My
earliest
memory
as
a
writer
deals
with
my
mother
and
father
reading
me
story
books
before
bedtime.
They
would
read
me
such
tales
so
often
(of
course
on
my
demand)
that
I
would
begin
to
memorize
the
words.
After
not
too
long,
T
would
make
my
parents
let
me
"read"
the
stories
to
them,
remembering
the
exact
words
to
go
with
every
page's
picture.
Once
I
had
come
this
far
I
would
often
abandon
my
Barbie
dolls
during
the
day
to
"write"
the
very
stories
I
was
read
at
night.
Since
I
was
merely
three
years
old
and
not
yet
familiar
with
the
alphabet,
I
would
sit
for
long
hours
drawing
random
shapes
and
lines
as
T
recited
my
favorite
bedtime
stories
aloud
to
myself.
Upon
the
completion
of
my
writing,
I
would
run
to
my
parents
with
the
story
I
had
"written"
with
great
pride.
In
second
grade
I
recall
my
teacher,
Mrs.
Miller,
assigning
a
creative
writing
assignment
in
which
we
had
to
write
and
illustrate
our
own
short
story.
She
handed
out
booklets
of
construction
paper
and
left
us
to
create.
My
story
was
a
tale
about
a
cat
Fluffy
who
ran
away
from
home
and
caused
her
8-year-old
owner
to
cry.
In
the
end,
Fluffy
returns
home
safe,
happier
than
ever
to
see
her
owner.
This
tale,
based
on
my
own
cat
Fluffy's
disappearance
and
return
won
the
class
prize
for
writing,
as
it
was
complete
with
an
author
biography
on
the
back
inside
cover!
I
was
admittedly
Mrs.
Miller's
class
pet
and
favorite
student,
so
when
T
had
to
move
halfway
through
the
school
year,
she
assigned
the
class
to
each
write
me
an
individual
letter
(of
course
on
the
popular
large-lined
grade
school
paper
which
also
had
room
for
illustrations).
About
three
weeks
after
my
move,
I
was
sitting
in
class
and
my
new
principal
entered
the
classroom
and
delivered
to
me
a
large
heavy
envelope.
Inside
was
a
personal
letter
from
each
of
my
old
friends
and
classmates!
As
one
could
have
perhaps
guessed,
1
took
many
hours
that
evening
and
wrote
each
of
my
classmates
back!
This
memory
will
forever
be
a
poignant
one
in
both
my
history
as
a
student
and
also
as
a
writer.
Now
comfortable
in
my
new
school,
Mrs.
Luongo,
my
third
grade
teacher,
assigned
each
member
of
the
class
a
letter
of
the
alphabet,
and
told
us
we
were
to
chose
any
topic
that
began
with
our
letter
and
write
a
report
on
it.
My
letter
was
"K"
and
I
chose
the
koala
bear
as
my
topic.
It
was
on
this
topic
that
I
wrote
my
first
grade
school
report,
which
was
essentially
a
task
at
collaborating
information
from
various
encyclopedias.
I
remember
this
new
type
of
writing
coming
as
quite
a
change
to
me.
With
my
transition
to
junior
high
school
also
came
a
change
in
what
was
expected
of
me
as
a
writer.
In
sixth
grade,
my
language
and
social
studies
teacher,
Mrs.
Riva,
assigned
the
class
a
paper
on
one
of
the
US
Presidents.
Although
we
had
not
really
studied
the
Presidents
yet,
this
was
Mrs.
Riva's
way
of
making
us
acquire
information,
have
us
write
about
it,
and
then
present
it
to
our
classmates.
I
chose
Woodrow
Wilson.
This
paper
was
the
first
in
my
writing
history
where
strict
rules
on
form,
content,
and
the
importance
of
avoiding
plagiarism
were
enforced.
We
were
to
have
a
title
page,
use
an
ordinary
font,
and
not
use
pictures
or
photographs
of
any
kind
in
our
reports.
Having
always
been
a
part
of
the
Gifted
&
Talented
program
in
grade
school,
I
remember
hearing
the
warning
of
the
"eighth
grade
term
paper"
years
in
advance.
Finally,
that
time
came
and
all
of
my
anticipation
was
over.
The
20
of
us
in
the
program
had
conferences
with
our
coordinator
to
chose
topics.
Because
HIV/AIDS
has
touched
my
life
in
a
very
serious
way,
I
decided
to
do
my
term
paper
on
AIDS.
At
that
time
I
did
not
realize
how
huge
of
a
topic
I
had
decided
on.
This
paper
was
a
very
big
deal.
It
had
to
be
handed
in
with
both
a
short
and
detailed
outline
and
we
were
required
to
use
very
strict
and
respectable
sources.
I
put
everything
I
had
in
me
as
far
as
writing
skills
go
into
this
paper!
I
vividly
recall
spending
my
entire
Christmas
break,
day
and
night,
making
this
paper
as
perfect
as
possible.
My
endless
diligent
efforts
paid
off!
We
were
given
two
grades
on
the
paper-one
for
scientific
content
and
another
for
form,
strategy
and
grammar.
I
received
an
A+/A+
while
none
of
the
other
nineteen
students
even
got
one
A,
and
only
a
small
handful
had
received
an
A-.
I
obviously
still
take
pride
in
this
accomplishment.
As
I
moved
from
middle
to
high
school,
probably
the
biggest
change
in
my
writing
was
in
the
amount
that
I
wrote.
Instead
of
perhaps
three
writing
assignments
per
month,
I
was
now
required
to
write
nearly
in
every
class
on
a
nightly
basis.
This
new
and
increased
writing
load
immediately
made
me
more
comfortable
writing.
"Practice
makes
perfect,"
I
thought
to
myself
and
my
confidence
grew
steadily.
Furthermore,
the
school
district
required
that
every
freshman
take
a
course
entitled
"Research
and
Writing."
This
was
a
singlesemester
course
designed
to
have
students
learn
how
to
thoroughly
research
various
types
of
sources
and
complete
a
lengthy
and
comprehensive
research
paper.
In
a
conference
with
my
teacher
I
explained
that
I
had
written
a
very
detailed
research
paper
on
AIDS
for
the
G&T
program
in
the
8th
grade.
I
explained
how
I
had
chosen
AIDS
not
realizing
how
huge
of
a
topic
it
was,
and
asked
if
I
could
perhaps
focus
on
one
single
aspect
of
AIDS
and
make
that
my
topic
for
the
class.
She
readily
agreed,
and
1
chose
AIDS
education
as
my
topic.
Meanwhile,
I
was
given
my
first
taste
of
lab
reports
in
my
Honors
Biology
course.
Although
I
had
done
simple
experiments
before,
I
had
never
done
a
formal
standard
write-up
before
my
freshman
year.
I
recall
disliking
writing
these
labs
because
of
the
lack
of
creative
leniency
I
was
granted.
I
should
also
mention
that
all
throughout
my
life
I
have
kept
diaries
and
journals
of
my
thoughts
and
emotions.
I
also
kept
a
journal
of
places
I
visited
as
well
as
my
reactions
to
these
places.
I
also,
over
the
course
of
my
childhood,
have
filled
many
books
(unlined
white
paper
was
all
I
could
use
for
some
reason)
with
poetry.
However,
it
wasn't
until
my
junior
year
in
high
school
that
I
invested
in
locks--when
my
mom
got
nosy.
My
sophomore
year
in
high
school
is
when
I
first
encountered
Mr.
Morone.
He
was
without
a
doubt
the
most
feared
teacher
in
the
high
school.
Rumors
circulated
about
his
one-question
pop
quizzes,
impossible
objective
tests,
and
his
raging
temper.
As
a
student
in
his
English
II
honors
class,
I
was
just
as
scared
as
the
rest
of
the
school.
And
although
the
rumors
did
pretty
much
prove
true,
Mr.
Morone
taught
me
an
amazing
amount
about
writing.
I
wrote
countless
papers
for
this
course,
including
one
on
my
writing
past
and
another
on
my
plans
for
the
future
and
how
writing
would
be
necessary.
Mr.
Morone's
class
was
the
first
time
I
was
made
to
pay
strict
attention
to
audience.
Mr.
Morone
graded
us
very
harshly,
requiring
that
we
concentrate
on
our
styles
and
techniques
carefully.
We
were
required
to
write
papers
as
characters,
outsiders,
authors,
critics,
and
we
were
also
instructed
to
write
with
very
different
audiences
in
mind.
For
this
course
I
also
wrote
a
lengthy
research
paper
on
the
Black
Death.
Simultaneously,
I
was
mastering
the
art
of
lab
reports
in
Chemistry
Honors.
My
junior
year,
in
Ms.
Heller's
English
III
Honors
class,
I
wrote
a
very
difficult
paper
comparing
three
of
William
Faulkner's
novels.
I
used
Absolom,
AbsolomL
As
I
Lav
Dying,
and
A
Light
in
August.
I
had
to
find
a
common
theme
or
idea
that
Faulkner
used
in
these
novels
and
form
a
thesis.
My
thesis
was
that
Faulkner's
ties
to
the
land
where
he
lived
in
the
South
helped
greatly
in
the
construction
of
his
novels.
This
was
a
difficult
paper,
and
one
that
I
worked
on
extremely
hard.
All
the
while
I
was
also
writing
boring
lab
reports
for
my
Physics
Honors
course.
Senior
year
I
was
back
with
Mr.
Morone
for
Advanced
Placement
English
as
well
as
for
Public
Speaking.
Another
year
was
accompanied
with
yet
another
long
research
paper.
This
time
I
wrote
on
Henry
VIII
and
his
creation
of
the
Church
of
England,
which
I
found
to
be
an
extremely
interesting
topic.
For
Public
Speaking,
I
wrote
numerous
speeches,
including
an
entertaining
speech,
a
pet
peeve
speech,
a
humorous
speech,
a
demonstration
speech,
and
an
improv
speech.
This
year
I
also
wrote
a
eulogy,
which
I
read
for
my
class.
This
eulogy,
for
my
close
aunt
who
passed
away
very
prematurely
of
carbon
monoxide
poisoning,
was
perhaps
the
most
moving
thing
that
I
had
ever
written.
It
is
also
not
only
my
most
rewarding
experience
through
writing,
but
one
of
the
most
valuable
experiences
of
my
life.
It
provided
me
with
feelings
of
internal
sensation,
and
unbelievable
fulfillment.
lam
so
glad
that
I
was
able
to
share,
through
my
perfectly-constructed
words,
some
of
my
aunt's
last
spoken
memories
to
her
loved
ones.
In
my
senior
year
I
also
took
over
the
school
newspaper.
I
went
from
being
the
Features
editor
the
prior
two
years
to
editor-in-chief.
Through
this
job,
the
type
of
audience
I
aimed
for
became
even
more
apparent
and
important
to
me.
Also
in
my
senior
year,
I
of
course
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
working
on
my
college
essay.
I
also
ended
up
writing
a
significant
amount
of
poetry
as
it
was
quite
an
emotional
year
for
me,
which
always
aids
my
writing,
even
if
it
dampens
my
mood.
Finally
I
was
on
to
my
Lafayette
writing
career.
My
freshman
year
I
came
in
confident,
as
my
teachers
had
all
told
me
T
would
undoubtedly
succeed
and
I
also
scored
a
5
on
the
AP
test
and
a
710
on
the
SAT
TT
subject
test
in
writing.
However,
inside
I
was
still
a
bit
nervous,
as
I
was
now
in
college,
and
that
was
quite
a
steep
step
from
high
school!
In
FYS,
T
wrote
a
paper
answering
the
question
"What
is
evil?,"
a
rather
difficult
paper.
I
also
analyzed
a
website
and
a
chapter
in
a
critical
journal.
As
our
main
project,
I
produced
a
30+
page
paper
contrasting
different
satanic
churches
and
their
evolution
over
time.
I
managed
to
get
A's
on
all
of
my
papers
and
moved
right
on
to
Eng
205
rather
than
taking
College
Writing.
Meanwhile,
I
experienced
my
first
taste
of
college
lab
reports
my
freshman
year
in
Psychology
110.
Never
before
have
I
experienced
something
so
boring
(despite
my
love
for
psychology)!
I
was
sure
once
and
for
all
after
all
of
those
lab
reports,
that
1
certainly
loved
creative
and
analytic
writing,
and
not
the
dry
formatted
writing
of
such
reports.
Still
in
my
freshman
year,
now
in
Eng
205,1
wrote
a
paper
incorporating
the
central
scene
in
King
Lear
(storm)
with
Freud's
psychoanalytic
approach
as
seen
in
Dora.
I
analyzed
the
storm
scene
as
though
it
were
a
dream
being
psychoanalyzed
by
Freud
himself.
Also
in
my
Eng
205
class
I
wrote
a
play
by
piecing
together
excerpts
from
the
course's
many
texts,
which
was
also
very
challenging.
During
my
freshman
year,
and
continuing
into
the
present
day,
by
the
request
of
my
psychologist
I
keep
a
detailed
journal
of
my
feelings.
This
entirely
different
form
of
writing
has
helped
me
in
an
amazing
way
to
overcome
a
very
serious
case
of
depression.
I
would
write
in
my
journal
and
then
at
my
bi-weekly
meetings
T
would
read
to
my
doctor
what
T
had
written.
This
was
an
extremely
valuable
experience,
proving
amazingly
helpful
in
my
recovery.
Finally
1
come
to
my
sophomore
year
in
college.
For
both
semesters
(English
210
and
English
344)
I
kept
reading
journals
which
I
thought
were
an
excellent
idea
and
a
great
way
to
trace
my
thoughts
on
the
reading.
This
was
an
exceptionally
valuable
tool
for
me
as
a
writer.
For
English
344
I
also
wrote
a
very
lengthy
paper
comparing
Quentin
Compson
of
Faulkner's
The
Sound
and
the
Fury
to
Salinger's
Holden
Caulfield
of
The
Catcher
in
the
Rye.
In
this
paper
I
drew
my
own
theses
to
write
a
very
critical
paper
that
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
writing.
This
paper
was
neither
as
mindless
or
as
mundane
as
many
of
the
other
papers
I
had
written,
even
for
my
English
courses.
Once
we
had
an
idea,
we
had
to
keep
going
with
it,
for
pages
and
pages.
It
took
much
skill
and
thought.
At
the
same
time
I
also
was
doing
much
writing
for
my
Hinduism
and
Alternative
Religious
Movements
classes.
In
the
second
semester
for
my
VAST
I
wrote
a
research
paper
on
AIDS
and
the
Catholic
church,
which
I
did
not
find
to
be
particularly
interesting,
as
there
was
simply
no
information
available.
However,
in
this
class
I
also
completed
the
most
challenging
writing
task
I've
ever
done.
I
had
to
take
three
papers,
one
on
the
immune
system,
one
on
the
structure
of
HIV
and
one
on
the
life
cycle
of
HIV,
each
which
were
four
pages
and
condense
them
in
to
one
single
paper.
This
single
paper
had
to
be
only
three
pages
and
was
supposed
to
serve
as
an
"article"
for
The
Lafayette.
I
had
to
pick
and
choose
very
selectively
as
to
what
would
be
said
about
structure,
life
cycle
and
HIV's
effects
on
the
immune
system.
I
had
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
audience
I
was
writing
for
knew
nothing
about
AIDS.
Yet
I
had
to
incorporate
all
aspects
of
the
virus
into
a
concise
paper
which
would
adequately
inform
the
reader
without
overwhelming
him
or
her.
This
was
without
a
doubt
the
hardest
thing
I
have
done
as
a
writer,
although
I
managed
to
succeed
(but
not
without
a
significant
amount
of
frustration).
So
here
lies
my
history
as
a
writer.
I
hope
this
year,
to
improve
through
the
WA
program,
both
through
the
help
of
my
fellow
WAs
as
well
as
through
my
hard
work
and
dedication
to
the
students
in
FYS
099
that
I
am
able
to
work
with!
