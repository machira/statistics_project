Literacy
Narrative
2008
The
fluidity
of
writing
and
the
way
in
which
writers
can
adapt
to
or
develop
different
styles
and
techniques
are
important
factors
that
contribute
to
writingOs
place
as
a
necessary
and
lifelong
skill.
Useful
in
almost
every
discipline
as
a
communication
mechanism,
writing
and
the
way
in
which
one
can
improve
his
or
her
writing
are
important
to
learn.
The
College
Writing
Program
understands
and
practices
these
ideas.
The
program
believes
in
collaboration
and
students
working
amongst
their
peers.
Through
working
with
other
students,
and
filling
the
role
as
Writing
Associate,
facilitating
conversations
about
their
writing,
I
have
learned
a
great
deal
about
myself
and
my
own
approach
to
writing.
I
have
experienced
the
positives
and
negatives
of
working
with
other
students,
as
well
as
the
importance
of
professionalism
in
the
program.
Two
semesters
as
a
Writing
Associate
opened
my
eyes
to
the
realities
of
the
job,
as
well
as
the
many
ways
in
which
people
write
and
approach
writing.
Working
with
both
first
year
students,
as
well
as
upperclassmen
who
were
at
the
time
my
peers,
proved
to
be
both
challenging
and
rewarding
in
different
ways.
I
witnessed
my
approach
to
my
own
writing
assignments
change
over
the
course
of
the
year,
as
I
began
to
think
about
my
assignments
and
the
process
of
completing
them,
before
I
began
to
write
them.
I
was
never
a
fan
of
the
outline
method,
and
it
surprised
me
when
I
began
bulleting
and
making
notes
for
paragraph
structure
and
sources
to
be
used
instead
of
jumping
into
the
body
of
my
assignment
and
typing
away.
Though
it
at
times
seemed
mundane,
all
of
the
conversations
about
the
writing
process
paid
off,
and
I
am
happy
to
have
developed
that
skill
and
added
it
to
my
own
writing
repertoire.
It
has
made
my
writing
more
organized
and
concise,
and
helps
to
clear
my
head
when
I
look
to
begin
an
assignment.
2
During
my
third
semester
working
as
a
Writing
Associate,
I
was
again
assigned
to
a
first
year
seminar
class.
I
enjoyed
my
experience
with
first
year
students,
and
I
was
looking
forward
to
getting
to
know
both
them
and
the
professor
with
whom
I
would
be
working.
Based
on
my
previous
experience,
I
was
under
the
impression
that
such
a
class
was
NeasierO
to
work
with.
I
thought
that
because
first
year
students
were
new
to
the
program,
as
well
as
to
the
college,
they
would
be
more
nervous
and
conscientious
about
the
repercussions
and
consequences
that
may
come
with
missing
a
conference
or
not
submitting
their
work
on
time.
My
assumption
got
the
best
of
me,
as
I
was
faced
with
a
class
full
of
students
who
were
not
at
all
convinced
by
my
enthusiasm
for
and
strong
belief
in
the
WA
program,
or
their
professorOs
comments
about
its
usefulness
and
necessity
to
their
class
and
their
final
grades.
I
wanted
the
students
to
respect
me
as
someone
who
could
help
them
improve
their
work
and
had
good
ideas
to
share,
but
also
treat
me
as
a
fellow
student,
and
not
someone
who
they
were
forced
to
meet
with.
It
was
not
always
easy,
and
though
I
worked
hard,
I
cannot
say
that
I
successfully
convinced
each
and
every
student
at
the
importance
of
conferences,
as
well
as
the
validity
of
my
position.
Logistically,
the
class
was
difficult
to
contact
and
meet
with,
and
I
quickly
had
to
learn
how
to
be
able
to
be
more
flexible
with
my
time.
Many
students
had
multiple
extra
curricular
commitments,
which
resulted
in
little
available
time
for
conferences.
Throughout
the
semester
I
focused
on
maintaining
a
professional
and
stern
stance
toward
the
ideals
of
the
program,
the
professorOs
rules
and
grading
criteria,
and
my
own
time
and
school
commitments.
I
learned
how
to
work
with
my
professor
by
explaining
to
her
the
truth
of
what
was
going
on
with
her
students,
3
and
asking
for
advice
on
how
I
should
proceed.
I
struggled
with
many
students
who
did
not
understand
or
care
to
see
the
importance
of
reviewing
their
work,
and
who
often
settled
for
the
quickest
result
with
the
least
amount
of
effort.
It
was
difficult
to
work
with
students
who
didnOt
strive
to
be
their
best,
and
it
took
multiple
attempts
to
realize
the
best
way
to
work
with
them
and
encourage
them
to
continue
working.
Not
every
student
in
the
class
was
difficult
to
work
with,
and
the
class
did
provide
a
diverse
background
which
allowed
them
to
bring
different
perspectives
to
their
assignments.
I
was
able
to
learn
different
ways
to
approach
a
task
or
writing
assignment,
by
watching
how
the
students
approached
their
work
due
to
their
different
strengths
or
interests.
Some
students
wrote
more
personally,
some
students
had
a
knack
for
incorporating
dialogue
and
vignette
style
story-telling,
while
other
students
preferred
dynamic
research
and
comparative
descriptions.
My
experience
as
a
Writing
Associate
has
not
been
perfect.
There
have
been
times
where
I
question
my
work
or
the
help
that
I
am
giving
the
students
I
work
with.
Working
with
other
people
is
not
always
easy,
and
different
people
require
different
kinds
of
treatment.
What
I
have
learned,
and
what
has
remained
consistent
over
my
years
as
a
Writing
Associate,
is
the
importance
of
carrying
myself
in
a
confident
and
professional
manner.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
has
taught
me
the
importance
of
professionalism,
and
the
ways
in
which
to
work
with
your
peers,
as
well
as
your
superiors.
I
have
learned
both
how
to
communicate
with
the
students
I
am
working
with,
as
well
as
the
professors,
and
how
to
work
together
and
share
ideas
with
one
another,
for
the
best
of
the
class.
Over
the
past
year,
my
writing
has
continued
to
move
away
from
the
disciplines
I
am
most
comfortable.
As
I
broadened
my
course
load,
I
began
writing
for
different
kinds
of
classes,
4
and
needed
to
develop
the
necessary
style
in
which
my
ideas
would
best
be
presented.
The
kind
of
writing
I
most
enjoy
is
the
kind
that
comes
completely
naturally
to
me,
and
can
be
done
without
much
thought.
My
most
natural
writing
is
very
raw,
and
often
comes
out
onto
the
paper
just
the
way
I
think
about
an
idea
in
my
head.
I
often
write
the
way
I
speak,
and
I
create
an
informal
but
descriptive
conversation
with
my
work.
I
enjoy
this
style
that
I
have
developed
and
began
to
call
my
own,
however,
it
is
important
for
me
to
branch
out
and
attempt
other
kinds
of
writing
within
other
kinds
of
disciplines.
Successfully
writing
something
that
lies
outside
of
my
comfort
zone
is
an
extremely
rewarding
experience,
and
builds
up
my
confidence
as
a
writer.
My
goal
is
to
be
able
to
express
myself,
and
through
working
with
other
writers
and
trying
out
different
kinds
of
writing
myself,
I
am
learning
more
and
more
ways
that
that
can
be
accomplished.
As
I
moved
away
from
my
work
as
a
Writing
Associate,
the
College
Writing
program,
and
Lafayette
College,
to
study
in
Barcelona
for
the
semester,
I
did
not
anticipate
changing
my
writing
style
or
practices.
Taking
classes
in
a
different
country,
and
in
a
different
language,
was
extremely
intimidating.
The
first
few
days
of
my
semester
were
nerve
racking
and
stressful,
and
I
was
unsure
about
my
ability
to
communicate
in
Spanish,
as
well
as
English
because
of
the
various
levels
of
English
proficiency
within
the
city.
Even
speaking
in
my
natural
language
was
at
times
difficult,
and
I
still
encountered
confusion
and
misunderstanding
on
a
daily
basis.
I
realized
that
writing
to
my
classmates
and
professors
in
English,
often
needed
to
be
edited
and
abridged,
to
result
in
short
and
concise
sentences
that
were
used
solely
to
get
my
point
across.
I
began
to
see
writing
in
a
new
way,
and
understood
its
communicative
purpose.
Being
in
Spain
also
made
me
aware
of
the
differences
in
writing,
for
those
non-native
English
speakers.
Many
5
people
I
corresponded
with
attempted
to
create
perfect
grammatical
structures,
that
in
the
end
seemed
entirely
too
formal
for
our
common
everyday
conversations.
They
were
not
always
aware
of
colloquial
terms
and
certain
words
were
often
lost.
At
times
reading
the
broken
English
and
misused
phrases
seemed
amusing,
and
I
will
admit
I
had
a
few
laughs
over
some
of
my
foreign
friends,
teachers,
and
classmatesO
expressions,
not
realizing
the
struggles
they
were
enduring,
just
to
tell
me
a
simple
story
or
ask
me
a
question.
That
is,
not
until
I
had
to
respond
to
them
or
write
my
own
midterm
papers.
Having
taken
Spanish
classes
for
years,
including
high
level
Spanish
that
focused
on
writing
longer
papers
with
a
professor
who
picked
apart
our
grammar
mistakes,
I
was
not
that
phased
the
idea
of
writing
my
assignments
in
Spanish,
and
assumed
it
would
not
be
a
big
deal.
I
considered
myself
to
be
better
at
writing
in
Spanish
than
speaking
in
Spanish.
I
thought
that
if
I
was
not
always
able
to
say
the
right
thing
in
person,
I
would
most
certainly
be
able
to
write
it
correctly.
I
underestimated
the
effort
and
the
struggles
that
come
along
with
learning
a
new
language,
and
attempting
to
write
and
correspond
with
a
native
speaker.
My
tenses
were
not
consistent,
and
I
was
trying
to
use
some
of
my
English
writing
style
and
favored
tricks,
that
just
did
not
translate,
literally.
I
had
a
difficult
time
getting
used
to
not
writing
perfectly,
and
not
writing
in
a
way
that
resulted
in
praise.
Many
times
my
writing
was
seen
as
mediocre,
decent,
or
just
okay.
All
my
life
I
was
used
to
getting
lengthy
comments
from
professors
and
teachers,
and
I
had
always
been
told,
NYou
write
so
well!O
Even
though
it
was
another
language
and
the
writing
was
bound
to
be
different,
the
perfectionist
in
me
had
could
not
accept
these
struggles
and
mistakes.
Throughout
6
these
struggles
and
moments
of
self-doubt,
I
thought
about
my
job
as
a
Writing
Associate,
and
the
ways
in
which
comments
and
corrections
can
be
used
to
improve
oneOs
writing.
My
experience
in
Barcelona
humbled
me
and
taught
me
that
even
Writing
Associates
need
help
with
their
writing.
As
the
fall
semester
approaches,
I
am
a
bit
anxious
about
my
first
writing
assignments.
Having
the
experience
of
not
getting
my
ideas
across
as
clearly
as
I
would
have
hoped
has
grounded
me
and
made
me
realize
that
revision
and
review
can
help
oneOs
writing
in
any
language.
I
am
not
sure
what
kind
of
class
I
will
be
assigned
to,
or
what
kinds
of
students
I
will
be
working
with,
but
I
hope
to
have
students
who
can
respect
me,
my
suggestions,
and
the
strength
of
the
College
Writing
Program.
