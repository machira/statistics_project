Writing
Memoirs
Bob
and
Rob.
That
was
the
title
of
my
first
real
story.
It
was
the
tale
of
two
boys
who
went
to
the
video
arcade
and
got
sucked
into
the
game
they
were
playing.
Very
deep,
right?
Well,
to
me
it
was.
The
story
came
complete
with
intricate,
action
packed
illustrations
of
the
adventure.
My
parents
thought
that
it
was
the
best
piece
of
writing
they
had
ever
seen
and
they
didn't
have
to
convince
me
that
I
was
brilliant.
While
this
may
seem
trivial,
it
was
the
beginning
of
my
love
of
writing.
I
learned
to
be
creative
before
I
learned
to
write,
so
once
I
could
actually
write
my
thoughts
down
(in
crayon)
I
knew
that
I
was
the
best
thing
since
Judy
Blume.
When
you're
in
first
grade,
teachers
and
parents
see
anything
that
you
write
as
a
masterpiece,
but
once
you
hit
second
grade
you're
in
for
it.
Every
morning
I
would
come
into
class
and
take
out
my
lined
paper
and
practice
my
cursive.
"Try
and
make
the
bubble
on
your
d
first..
.before
the
line."
What
was
this
all
about?
Why
all
of
a
sudden
are
they
making
such
a
big
deal
out
of
such
little
things?
Last
year
I
could
do
anything
and
get
praise
for
it.
Then
came
the
paper
assignment.
"Tonight
I
want
you
each
to
write
a
paper
on
what
it
means
to
be
an
American.
It
will
be
graded."
What
happened
to
the
creativity?
Where
are
Bob
and
Rob
going
to
fit
into
this?
Why
is
everything
changing?
I
had
no
idea
what
lay
ahead
of
me
in
the
following
13
years.
Anyway,
in
the
end
the
paper
came
out
okay.
My
parents
helped
me
put
what
I
wanted
to
say
onto
paper
and
I
thought
that
I
had
done
a
great
job
in
the
end.
My
teacher
agreed
that
it
was
a
good
paper
(I
should
clarify
that
the
"paper",
at
the
time,
was
only
about
two
paragraphs)
but
said
that
I
needed
to
work
on
my
structure.
Structure?
This
was
all
getting
too
complicated.
It's
amazing
how
difficult
everything
seems
when
you
are
going
through
it,
and
how
simple
it
seems
when
you
look
back
on
it.
In
middle
school,
research
papers
were
basically
a
reiteration
of
what
the
textbook
said.
A
paper
on
volcanic
rock
contained
the
information
in
the
section
of
the
science
book
entitled
"Volcanic
Rock".
As
long
as
you
could
read
the
chapter,
you
could
write
the
paper.
But
when
you
are
in
5th
and
6th
grade,
this
is
very
tedious
work
that
takes
a
very
long
time.
It
was
at
this
point
in
my
academic
career
that
I
began
to
realize
that
an
extra
bit
of
effort
goes
a
long
way
with
the
teacher.
At
the
end
of
my
volcanic
rock
paper
I
added
in
my
own
opinion
about
what
I
had
read
in
the
text.
The
teacher
loved
it,
and
thus
I
was
motivated
to
experiment
in
the
years
to
come.
In
7th
or
8th
grade,
I
was
introduced
to
my
least
favorite
type
of
paper
writing
--
the
group-paper.
Making
the
transition
from
writing
simple
papers
to
writing
papers
that
involved
actual
research
is
a
tough
one.
Many
teachers
thought
that
assigning
a
paper
to
a
group
of
kids
rather
than
an
individual
was
a
more
effective
way
of
learning
this
process.
In
my
mind
there
are
three
kinds
of
kids
in
every
group
paper
assignment.
There
is
the
kid
who
blatantly
does
nothing,
the
one
who
pretends
to
know
what
they
are
doing,
and
the
kid
who
write
the
paper.
I
was
the
kid
who
wrote
the
paper.
Research
is
not
fun
when
it
is
on
a
topic
that
is
of
no
interest
to
anyone
in
the
group.
In
middle
school,
the
topics
are
rarely
of
any
interest
to
the
student.
I
did
not
want
to
write
a
paper
on
the
colonization
of
Africa
any
more
than
the
next
kid
did,
but
its
got
to
be
done
and
this
is
what
sited
out
the
go-getters
from
the
moochies.
As
ambitious
as
I
was,
structure
and
coherence
were
scarcely
found
in
my
middle
school
papers
(although,
at
the
time,
they
were
considered
fine
pieces
of
writing).
I
knew
about
introductions
and
conclusions,
but
I
did
not
know
how
to
make
all
that
"stuff'
in
the
middle
flow
together
in
an
organized
fashion.
This
is
where
my
greatest
struggle
began.
I
was
no
longer
a
good
writer.
High
school
standards
were
different
and
my
grades
flip-flopped
around
in
the
B-C
range
until
one
day,
as
if
the
clouds
parted
and
I
saw
the
light,
I
got
it.
I
wish
that
I
could
explain
what
I
mean
by
this,
but
something
just
clicked.
It
was
really
not
until
my
junior
year
of
high
school
when
my
AP
U.S
history
teacher
told
me,
"Kate,
you
need
to
reared
your
paper
like
you
know
nothing
bout
the
subject
on
which
you
are
writing."
That
was
it.
What
would
a
stranger
say
about
my
paper?
What
would
they
question
about
it?
What
would
be
confusing
to
them?
Is
it
logically
organized?
I
began
to
ask
myself
these
questions
and
adjusting
my
papers
accordingly.
"This
paragraph
has
no
business
being
here
without
an
explanation
of
why
it
fits
in
with
my
thesis."
With
these
questions
came
more
praise
from
my
teachers
and
better
grades
on
my
report
card.
By
the
end
of
high
school
I
had
really
learned
how
to
write
an
effective
paper.
I
must
admit
that
when
the
first
draft
of
my
first
paper
was
due
for
FYS,
I
was
more
than
a
little
shocked
at
my
experience
during
peer
criticism.
I
was
fairly
confident
that
I
was
a
good
writer,
but
I
thought
that
other
freshman
would
be
just
as
competent..
.and
although
many
of
them
were,
the
paper
that
I
read
for
one
of
my
peers
had
no
structure,
no
form,
and
the
grammar
was
atrocious.
It
was
then
that
I
realized
that
writing
might
not
come
naturally
to
many
people.
I
had,
up
to
this
point,
had
a
fairly
easy
time
with
papers
and
through
that
it
was
a
simple
skill
that
every
18-year-old
had
to
have
mastered
by
college.
I
was
very
wrong.
I
saw
many
students
struggle
with
voicing
their
opinion
clearly
through
writing
and
begin
to
think
that
maybe
writing
was
just
"my
thing."
I
had
no
idea
that
sophomore
year
would
be
one
which
would
raise
many
questions
as
to
my
success
as
a
writer.
I
won't
lie.
The
reason
that
I
took
Intro
to
U.S.
Politics
was
because
I
needed
it
for
graduation
requirements.
On
the
first
day
of
classes
the
professor
told
us
that
there
would
be
a
25-page
research
paper
due
at
the
end
of
the
semester
that
could
be
on
any
political
topic
of
our
choice.
I
thought
that
this
would
be
a
breeze
because,
although
politics
is
not
my
area
of
expertise,
I
knew
that
I
would
find
something
to
interest
me.
Over
the
course
of
the
semester
there
were
reference
lists,
annotated
bibliographies
and
much
more
due
in
order
to
prepare
us
for
the
final
draft.
I
met
with
the
professor
about
3
times
and
discussed
my
progress
and
after
the
first
draft
was
due,
I
received
a
B-.
Not
bad,
I
thought,
considering
I
had
another
chance
to
raise
the
grade.
Unfortunately,
the
second
draft
did
not
exactly
pan
out
the
way
I
thought
it
would.
I
pulled
one
of
my
only
all-nighters
and
practically
rewrote
the
paper.
When
I
got
it
back
I
was
shocked
at
what
the
professor
had
written.
He
said
that
it
was
worse
than
my
first
draft
and
that
he
was
very
disappointed.
This
is
the
only
time
that
I
had
ever
had
a
paper
go
down
a
grade.
I
was
devastated,
but
knew
that
this
was
not
a
kind
of
writing
that
I
was
going
to
frequent.
This
experience,
along
with
a
few
others
nasty
writing
battles
that
I
had
that
year,
really
shook
my
confidence
as
a
writer.
I
wondered
if
writing
really
was
my
niche,
and
if
it
wasn't,
what
was?
I
feel
that
this
is
an
appropriate
time
to
intervene
and
discuss
teacher
comments
and
how
my
feelings
have
changed
over
the
past
7
years.
In
high
school,
teacher
comments
were
the
worst.
It's
amusing
to
think
about
now
because
papers
in
high
school
were
only
4
pages
long,
but
once
they
were
written,
I
wanted
nothing
else
to
do
with
them.
I
hated
teacher
comments
and
I
hated
the
way
that
I
felt
when
they
were
negative.
It
wasn't
until
I
got
to
college
that
I
realized
that
these
comments
were
not
malicious,
but
rather
they
were
constructive
criticism
that
was
meant
to
help
in
future
papers.
I
stopped
taking
the
comments
personally
(although
no
one
really
likes
receiving
anything
but
praise)
and
started
paying
attention
to
what
my
professors
were
saying.
This
changed
my
writing
a
lot.
Rather
than
tucking
away
a
paper
that
was
less
than
perfect,
I
worked
on
changing
it
and
making
it
more
academic
and
presentable.
My
writing
improved
immensely.
With
the
realization
that
constructive
criticism
was...well....constructive,
I
also
changed
my
feelings
on
drafts.
I
am
the
kind
of
person
who
works
well
under
pressure.
If
I
sit
down
and
know
that
I
have
a
deadline
tomorrow
at
10am,
my
paper
will
flow
out
of
me
and,
for
the
most
part,
get
more
than
adequate
results.
This
is
the
way
things
worked
for
years.
This
was
all
well
and
good
until
I
started
having
a
much
heavier
workload
and
realized
that
having
things
done
in
advance
would,
in
the
long
run,
probably
cause
me
a
lot
less
stress
and
save
me
from
getting
an
ulcer
at
the
age
of
20.
Now,
I
never
write
a
paper
without
writing
a
first
draft
and
meeting
with
my
professor.
I
would
rather
receive
all
this
constructive
criticism
before
I
hand
in
my
final
draft,
and
professors
respect
you
more
as
a
student
if
they
know
that
you
really
care
and
want
to
do
well.
I
would
say
that
this
is
the
most
important
realization
that
I
have
come
across
in
my
3
years
at
Lafayette.
At
any
rate,
first
semester
junior
year
provided
me
with
an
eye
opening
experience
that
I
will
never
forget-
Creative
Writing.
This
was,
by
far,
the
most
amazing
experience
of
my
college
career
to
date.
I
have
never
enjoyed
writing
as
much
as
I
did
during
this
class.
I
hadn't,
since
I
was
much
younger,
done
much
creative
writing
and
I
now
found
it
to
be
one
of
the
most
liberating
experiences
of
my
life.
At
the
beginning
I
was
timid,
but
then
took
advantage
of
the
freedom
that
I
was
being
handed.
There
was
no
structure
and
there
were
no
limits.
I
could
write
about
anything
I
wanted
in
any
genre
that
I
wanted
using
any
type
of
language
that
I
wanted.
I
was
fascinated
by
what
other
students
wrote
and
read
during
the
class
time,
but
moreover,
I
was
astonished
at
what
I,
myself,
was
putting
on
paper.
I
really
surprised
myself
and
learned
a
lot
about
myself
during
the
process.
Some
of
the
assignments
were
very
challenging,
but
the
results
were
always
well
worth
the
effort.
Not
only
did
I
learn
a
lot
during
this
class,
but
I
also
came
away
from
the
class
a
changed
person.
I
write
a
lot
on
my
own
now
and
let
my
emotions
come
through
in
poetry
or
short
stories
or
journals.
One
day
my
writing
might
be
for
others
to
read,
but
not
today.
Today
it
is
like
a
form
of
therapy-too
personal
for
other
eyes.
So,
in
my
senior
year
at
Lafayette
College,
I
feel
that
I
am
ready
to
share
what
I
have
learned
with
other
students
just
starting
their
4-year
journey.
I,
in
no
way,
want
to
sound
conceited,
but
I
do
want
to
sound
confident.
I
am
confident
that
I
have
learned
invaluable
techniques
that
will
help
students'
understand
what
it
is
to
write
a
respectable
paper
and
tackle
all
the
frustrations
that
accompany
that
task.
I
cannot
call
myself
a
poet
or
a
short
story
writer,
or
even
a
writer
at
all.
I
am
a
student
who
will
never
learn
all
there
is
to
know
about
writing.
I
am,
however,
ready
to
share
what
I
have
learned
so
far
and
know
that
I,
in
turn,
will
learn
things
from
the
students
who
I
am
helping.
These
memoirs
may
seem
somewhat
insignificant
when
examined
individually,
but
as
a
whole
they
have
shaped
me
into
the
writer
that
I
am
today.
