My
Literacy
Narrative
D
WA
Writing
Assignment
When
I
was
five
years
old,
I
sat
at
a
small
wooden
table,
in
a
tiny
New
York
City
office.
It
was
in
this
office
where
I
experienced
my
first
writing
act.
More
specifically,
I
was
in
the
domain
of
my
speech
therapist,
waiting
patiently
for
my
mother
to
finish
conversing
with
my
therapist.
Being
a
typical
restless
and
impatient
five-year
old,
and
desperately
needing
to
occupy
myself,
I
took
a
piece
of
notebook
paper
and
a
pencil,
and
began
to
write.
With
an
unsteady
and
inexperienced
hand,
I
wrote
a
one-page
narrative
about
why
I
went
to
the
office
in
New
York
City
two
or
three
times
a
week
and
why
it
was
extremely
important
that
I
attended
these
meetings
consistently.
After
I
finished
writing
the
paper,
which
I
assume
only
took
ten
minutes
to
complete,
I
recall
handing
it
over
to
my
speech
therapist,
who
after
reading
it,
called
it
Nthe
most
beautiful
thing
she
had
ever
read.O
Today,
at
the
age
of
nineteen,
I
look
back
at
the
paper
that
I
wrote
nearly
fourteen
years
ago,
and
it
never
fails
to
put
a
smile
on
my
face.
It
wasnOt
until
my
mid-teenage
years
that
I
finally
stopped
laughing
at
my
own
shortcomings
in
this
paper.
My
speech
therapist
had
called
it
a
masterpiece,
and
while
I
agreed,
I
initially
considered
it
to
be
a
repetitious
piece
of
work.
I
had
nearly
used
the
same
sentence
over
and
over;
run-on
sentences
were
prevalent,
as
well
as
spelling
errors
and
other
grammatical
errors.
However,
after
criticizing
my
own
paper,
I
took
a
step
back
and
truly
thought
about
what
I
had
written.
Instead
of
looking
at
the
paper
for
its
individual
flaws,
I
looked
at
the
short
narrative
as
a
whole;
an
entirety.
At
that
moment,
I
realized
that
it
was
the
content
of
the
paper
that
my
speech
therapist
found
remarkable.
It
shocked
me
that
in
all
the
times
that
I
had
read
my
own
first
piece
of
writing,
I
had
never
looked
at
it
for
its
true
beauty
and
ultimate
success.
In
this
paper,
I
had
proclaimed
my
own
independence
and
determination
to
overcome
all
obstacles
to
get
where
I
am
today.
I
had
made
it
clear
that
I
was
a
self-reliant
person
and
that
nothing
could
stand
in
my
way
and
prevent
me
from
achieving
my
goals.
From
a
five-year
oldOs
perspective,
I
realized
that
this
paper
was
saying
quite
a
lot.
Even
though
most
of
the
sentences
in
my
paper
were
repetitive,
it
only
made
my
determination
appear
stronger.
Once
I
was
done
looking
at
the
paper
from
this
unique
perspective,
I
said
to
myself,
NThis
is
a
masterpiece.O
Because
of
the
personal
revelation
that
I
had
experienced,
I
have
learned
that
it
is
the
content
of
a
paper
that
matters
the
most,
not
its
numerous
errors.
I
have
used
this
way
of
thinking
for
all
of
the
papers
that
I
have
written
to
this
day.
While
I
am
a
perfectionist
and
can
hardly
tolerate
spelling
and
grammar
errors,
I
clearly
recognize
that
the
most
striking
feature
of
a
paper
should
be
what
it
is
saying
to
the
reader,
as
every
piece
of
literature
should
captivate
its
audience.
Because
of
this
understanding,
instead
of
devoting
so
much
time
to
making
sure
that
a
paper
is
in
accordance
with
proper
English,
I
focus
on
the
substance
of
the
paper
and
how
I
can
make
it
interesting
and
simultaneously,
informative
to
the
reader.
I
can
honestly
say
that
the
paper
I
wrote
when
I
was
just
a
child
was
the
most
personal
piece
of
literature
that
I
have
ever
produced.
Simply,
it
was
because
I
did
not
worry
about
grammatical
errors;
instead,
I
was
only
concerned
about
letting
my
audience
know
about
the
kind
of
person
I
really
was.
While
I
was
too
young
at
the
time
to
fully
comprehend
the
impact
that
this
paper
would
eventually
make
on
my
writing,
reading
numerous
books
also
helped
pave
the
way
for
me
to
become
a
successful
writer.
My
parents
introduced
me
to
books
at
a
young
age
and
thus,
initiated
my
passion
for
reading.
I
read
books
almost
every
day,
anytime
and
anywhere
I
could
possibly
read.
I
recall
a
time
in
kindergarten
when
my
teacher,
who
felt
that
my
reading
skills
were
notable,
had
asked
me
if
I
would
like
to
go
to
the
principalOs
office,
along
with
two
other
classmates,
to
read
a
book
to
the
principal.
Oblivious
to
the
true
reason
why
my
teacher
had
chosen
me,
I
hesitatingly
accepted,
afraid
that
the
real
reason
I
had
to
go
to
the
principalOs
office
was
because
I
was
in
trouble
for
a
school
misdemeanor
of
some
sort.
However,
once
I
realized
that
I
was
only
in
the
principalOs
office
to
read
a
book,
I
was
honored
that
my
teacher
had
recognized
my
reading
abilities
and
asked
me
to
display
it
to
the
principal.
This
slightly
boosted
my
ego
and
confidence,
and
as
a
result,
I
found
myself
engaging
in
more
challenging
and
difficult
books.
Because
of
my
persistent
desire
to
be
challenged,
I
became
more
aware
of
different
writing
styles,
as
well
as
the
typical
structure
of
most
literary
works.
Truthfully,
I
learned
more
about
grammar
from
reading
childrensO
and
young
adult
books
and
merely
viewing
the
way
that
authors
used
quotation
marks,
commas,
semi-colons,
et
cetera.
My
vocabulary
was
also
greatly
enhanced
by
attempting
(I
cannot
say
that
I
succeeded
all
the
time)
to
read
books
that
were
beyond
my
reading
level.
All
of
the
bits
and
pieces
that
I
gained
from
reading
constantly
have
been
applied
to
all
of
my
writings.
Starting
to
read
at
an
early
age,
I
believe,
is
essential
to
any
writerOs
success
and
greatness,
and
I
strongly
attribute
most
of
my
writing
abilities
to
all
of
the
reading
that
I
have
done
over
the
years.
One
writer
in
particular
that
greatly
inspired
me
is
Roald
Dahl,
author
of
numerous
childrensO
books
such
as
Matilda,
Charlie
and
the
Chocolate
Factory,
James
and
the
Giant
Peach,
and
so
forth.
An
avid
reader
of
Dahl,
I
was
(and
still
am)
fascinated
by
his
ability
to
create
such
great
stories
that
were
so
unique
and
somewhat
peculiar,
yet
incredibly
appealing.
I
must
have
read
Matilda
about
ten
times,
as
I
found
that
I
could
never
tire
of
the
book.
DahlOs
unique
writing
style,
combined
with
his
remarkable
creativity
and
ability
to
come
up
with
such
unusual
stories,
created
a
whole
new
imaginative
world
for
me.
Because
of
Roald
Dahl,
I
understood
how
important
it
was
to
possess
creative
abilities
and
imagination
and
to
utilize
these
two
qualities
in
oneOs
own
writing.
While
I
knew
that
I
could
never
reach
to
DahlOs
level
and
become
a
successful
creative
writer
like
him,
I
strived
to
make
sure
that
most
of
my
creative
pieces
of
writing
were,
in
fact,
original
and
one-of-a-kind.
In
addition
to
being
inspired
by
Roald
DahlOs
ingenuity
and
wanting
to
possess
his
unique
abilities,
keeping
journals
for
most
of
the
books
that
I
have
read
throughout
my
high
school
career
has
heightened
my
creative
skills.
Beginning
in
eighth
grade,
all
of
my
English
professors
required
us
to
keep
a
journal
for
every
book
that
we
read
in
class.
While
I
initially
thought
that
this
was
a
tedious
process,
I
realized
the
significance
and
benefits
of
keeping
a
journal.
By
doing
so,
I
was
able
to
put
down
my
thoughts
and
feelings
about
whatever
I
had
read,
and
I
was
able
to
use
my
imagination
to
make
predictions
about
what
would
happen
next
in
the
story.
Keeping
a
journal
forced
me
to
expand
the
limits
of
my
mind
and
look
beyond
the
obvious.
I
became
more
aware
of
metaphors,
similes,
allusions,
personifications,
and
other
literary
devices
that
writers
employed
in
their
literature.
Because
of
my
accuracy
and
detailed
descriptions
in
these
journals,
most
of
my
teachers
rewarded
me
for
excellent
Njournal-keeping.O
I
realized
that
teachers
love
details
and
accurate
insights
into
what
a
character
is
thinking
or
feeling.
By
writing
down
my
personal
opinions
and
thoughts,
I
was
improving
my
ability
to
create
characters.
Journal-keeping
allowed
me
to
analyze
particular
characters
and
by
doing
this
in-depth,
I
have
been
able
to
see
characters
three-dimensionally.
Also,
by
looking
more
closely
at
character
developments,
I
have
been
able
to
recognize
what
makes
a
character
successful
in
that
it
is
appealing
to
the
reader,
and
the
reader
is
able
to
relate
to
that
character.
Thus,
keeping
a
journal
has
enabled
me
to
improve
my
writing
abilities
in
terms
of
the
many
individual
components
that
make
a
piece
of
writing
successful.
In
my
tenth
grade
English
class,
I
was
able
to
put
my
creative
skills
to
use,
with
a
twist.
My
teacher
gave
us
an
assignment
in
which
we
had
to
act
as
journalists
and
write
an
article
about
a
particular
issue
that
greatly
affected
us.
After
thorough
brainstorming,
I
decided
to
write
about
the
controversy
regarding
parents
and
their
obsessive
need
to
be
too
involved
with
the
sports
that
their
children
participate
in.
I
was
quite
excited
about
writing
this
article
as
it
was
a
topic
that
I
was
passionate
about.
In
order
to
make
it
the
best
that
it
could
be,
I
underwent
intensive
research,
looking
for
previous
published
articles
that
reported
incidents
where
parents
went
to
extreme
measures
during
a
sporting
event.
After
I
organized
all
of
the
documents
that
I
procured,
I
wrote
an
article
about
parents
and
sports
and
how
they
were
trying
to
live
vicariously
through
their
children.
As
a
result,
they
felt
the
need
to
make
their
children
the
absolute
best,
regardless
if
it
meant
physically
or
emotionally
hurting
other
parents,
a
coach,
a
referee,
or
other
persons
involved
in
a
particular
sport.
In
a
way,
the
article
that
I
had
written
became
a
psychological
analysis
of
parents,
and
it
was
a
very
interesting
piece
of
work.
Once
I
had
made
it
obvious
that
parents
had
flaws
that
needed
to
be
addressed,
I
cleverly
created
my
own
solution
to
the
problem:
a
new
version
of
the
Ten
Commandments.
However,
it
was
the
Ten
Commandments
of
Parents
and
Sports,
as
I
re-titled
it.
My
English
teacher
was
impressed
with
the
article
that
I
had
written
and
encouraged
me
to
submit
it
to
the
school
newspaper.
After
doing
so,
I
had
a
greater
desire
to
become
more
involved
with
the
school
newspaper.
I
ended
up
writing
a
few
more
articles
for
the
newspaper,
and
this
short
experience
with
journalistic
writing,
I
feel,
has
also
helped
me
become
a
better
writer.
Because
of
dabbling
in
different
writing
fields,
I
have
become
more
experienced
with
various
writing
styles
and
as
a
whole,
it
has
helped
me
to
become
a
more
successful
writer.
My
experience
in
writing
newspaper
articles
also
introduced
me
to
argumentative
writing.
In
most
of
the
articles
that
I
had
written,
I
was
trying
to
persuade
the
reader
to
think
a
certain
way,
providing
substantial
evidence
and
other
documents
that
helped
support
my
argument.
I
found
my
experience
in
working
with
the
school
newspaper
to
be
quite
useful
in
college,
especially
regarding
research
papers.
I
took
American
Studies
in
the
fall
semester,
and
the
last
assignment
was
to
write
a
research
paper
on
any
topic
that
we
had
discussed
in
class.
Once
again,
I
chose
to
explore
a
topic
that
I
was
extremely
interested
in,
and
set
off
to
find
as
many
other
sources
that
agreed
with
my
thesis
statement.
Already
familiar
with
how
to
set
up
my
argument
in
a
creative
way,
I
did
not
have
much
difficulty
in
organizing
my
paper.
However,
when
I
met
with
my
professor
to
discuss
the
rough
draft
of
my
paper,
I
was
surprised
at
how
dramatically
his
suggestions
improved
my
paper.
In
high
school,
most
of
the
editing
that
we
did
was
through
peer-editing,
so
the
majority
of
my
teachers
did
not
read
a
rough
draft
of
my
paper
before
it
was
due.
I
was
new
to
having
one
of
my
own
professors
read
a
paper
and
genuinely
care
about
improving
it.
Many
of
my
other
professors
were
also
willing
to
look
over
my
papers
before
they
were
due,
and
make
any
comments
and/or
suggestions.
After
my
meeting
with
my
professor,
I
realized
that
no
matter
how
good
I
consider
my
paper
to
be,
it
can
always
be
improved.
After
fixing
my
paper
and
utilizing
my
teacherOs
suggestions,
I
read
my
paper
over
and
noticed
a
big
difference.
His
suggestions
greatly
improved
the
tone
of
my
paper,
and
made
my
argument
appear
much
stronger
and
valid.
I
am
lucky
enough
that
I
took
his
class
in
the
fall
semester
because
I
was
able
to
use
most
of
my
professorOs
suggestions
in
future
papers
as
they
could
be
applied
to
almost
any
kind
of
writing.
I
do
not
think
that
most
of
my
papers
would
be
as
successful
if
I
had
not
had
that
single
meeting
with
my
professor,
as
well
as
with
the
other
professors.
I
think
that
it
is
for
this
exact
reason
why
I
was
so
intrigued
by
the
writing
program
that
Lafayette
offers.
I
knew
that
students
would
get
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
the
writing
associates
to
discuss
a
paper
before
it
was
due,
and
because
of
my
experiences
with
my
American
Studies
professor
and
other
professors,
I
know
that
editing
and
working
with
a
rough
draft
greatly
enhances
the
final
copy.
Thus,
I
think
that
it
is
important
that
students
fully
take
advantage
of
this
program
because
the
benefits
greatly
outweigh
the
disadvantages.
When
I
experienced
my
first
writing
act
fourteen
years
ago,
I
never
thought
that
it
would
serve
as
inspiration
for
future
pieces
of
writing.
Reflecting
back
on
what
I
wrote
over
ten
years
ago
has
constantly
reminded
me
that
it
is
the
content
of
the
paper
that
matters
the
most.
In
elementary
school,
we
are
taught
the
basics
of
grammar
and
most
teachers
highly
stress
the
importance
of
being
able
to
use
grammar
properly.
At
the
beginning
of
high
school,
most
teachers
limit
most
written
essays
to
the
typical
five-paragraph
format,
and
while
this
is
useful
for
beginning
writers,
most
writers
stick
to
this
format.
However,
I
believe
that
this
is
a
negative
thing
because
I
find
the
five-paragraph
format
to
be
quite
restrictive.
Teachers
sometimes
neglect
to
remind
us
that
creativity
and
imagination
goes
a
long
way.
Because
of
this
reason,
most
writers
have
a
skewed
vision
of
what
makes
a
piece
of
writing
succeed
with
its
readers.
Fortunately,
I
consider
myself
lucky
enough
to
have
had
excellent
Nteachers,O
both
inside
and
outside
of
the
classroom,
who
have
taught
me
that
it
is
the
heart
of
the
paper
that
creates
the
biggest
effect.
