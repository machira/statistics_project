My
Writing
Experience
in
the
Last
Year
By
Most
people
who
do
this
assignment,
I
believe,
will
attempt
to
describe
their
writing
experiences
of
the
last
year
in
a
very
broad,
macro
way.
While
it
is
difficult,
and
usually
inaccurate,
to
attempt
to
sum
up
a
year
of
experiences
in
terms
of
one
day
or
one
event,
I
will
attempt
to
do
so
in
describing
the
process
I
went
through
in
writing
a
paper
from
Saturday
March
28th
to
Monday
March
30th.
Hopefully,
this
will
demonstrate
the
malaise,
intensity,
luck
and
cool
calculation
that
goes
into
writing
a
paper.
The
process
I
go
through
in
the
days
up
to
and
including
the
day
of
writing
a
paper
is
similar
to
a
foot
chase
in
a
television
cartoon.
Let's
take
Scooby
Doo
for
example.
After
seeing
a
ghost,
Scooby,
Shaggy
and
Scrappy
take
chase
to
flee
this
ghost.
We
find
Scooby,
Scrappy
and
Shaggy
running
in
single
file,
with
several
feet
of
distance
between
them.
While
they
are
obliquely
aware
of
each
other's
existence,
they
are
physically
(and
emotionally,
as
they
are
thinking
of
their
own
needs
ie.
Getting
away
from
the
ghost)
detached
from
each
other.
This
mirrors
the
thought
process
that
takes
places
in
the
days
(or
weeks)
leading
up
to
the
actual
writing
of
a
paper.
The
ideas,
details,
and
specific
wordings
of
the
paper,
similar
to
Shaggy,
Scrappy
and
Scooby
are
running
through
my
head,
physically
and
intellectually
detached
from
one
another.
These
facts
and
details
exist
but
are
physically
independent
of
one
another.
The
several
physical
feet
of
detachment
between
them
is
filled
by
the
other
things
that
might
fill
ones
head
through
the
course
of
a
day
or
a
week:
other
classes,
social
and
family
issues,
meetings,
television
and
other
diversions
etc.
However,
a
funny
thing
happens
to
Scooby
and
the
gang
after
several
seconds
of
running.
The
ghost
whom
they
have
been
running
from
uses
his
magical
powers
to
conj
ure
himself
up
directly
in
front
of
them.
Scooby,
who
is
leading
the
pack,
comes
to
a
screeching
halt
several
feet
in
front
of
the
ghost.
Scrappy,
directly
behind
Scooby
and
oblivious
to
Scooby's
actions,
runs
right
into
Scooby,
flattening
him
into
Scooby's
back.
Shaggy
does
the
same,
flattening
himself
into
Scrappy.
The
three
characters,
at
one
point
j
ust
several
seconds
earlier
three
independent
figures,
are
now
absolutely
aware
of
one
another's
existence
and
needs.
The
feet
of
physical
and
emotional
distance
between
the
three
characters
have
been
eliminated.
This
mirrors
the
process
when
I
write
a
paper.
After
the
details
and
ideas
of
a
paper
have
been
bouncing
around
in
my
mind,
fairly
detached
from
one
another,
they
are
forced
to
coalesce
into
a
coherent
single
object
by
a
force
not
unlike
a
ghost:
a
due
date.
Also,
the
process
of
the
ideas
and
details
coming
together
is
undertaken
with
the
same
urgency,
as
I
usually
do
wait
until
the
last
minute
to
write
my
papers.
The
paper
which
I
wrote
in
the
last
weekend
of
March,
1998
was
no
exception.
The
paper
was
assigned
four
weeks
before
the
due
date.
While
I
had
ample
time
to
write
the
paper
(including
ten
days
over
spring
break,
a
spring
break
in
which
I
was
at
home
and
fairly
inactive),
I
let
the
idea
run
around
in
my
head,
detached
from
one
another.
I
almost
let
the
ideas
run
around
a
bit
too
much
I
my
head
as
I
returned
from
Spring
Break
on
Sunday
March
22nd
with
no
research
done,
no
paper
written
and
a
due
date
of
the
following
Friday,
which
was
5
days
away.
Scooby
was
in
danger
of
running
right
smack
into
the
ghost,
in
which
case
Scrappy
and
Shaggy's
imminent
collision
would
be
the
least
of
his
concerns.
Fortunately,
the
benevolent
ghost
(ie
the
professor)
changed
the
due
date
to
the
following
Monday,
the
30th.
How
foolish
of
me
to
think
that
the
extra
weekend
to
work
on
the
paper
would
provide
enough
of
a
net
for
me
to
comfortably
finish
the
paper.
Through
the
course
of
that
week,
I
downloaded
about
30
articles
from
Lexus-Nexus.
That's
it.
I
didn't
read
the
articles
or
organize
my
paper,
I
just
downloaded
the
articles.
On
Saturday
March
28th,
at
10:30
AM,
with
thirty
or
so
unmarked
articles
my
only
piece
of
work,
my
story
begins.
I
woke
up
at
10
:30
that
morning
with
about
five
and
a
half
hours
of
sleep
under
my
belt,
1
awoke
to
begin
my
work
study
as
a
monitor
at
the
Kirby
Library,
located
in
the
basement
of
South.
Working
this
three
hour
shift
allowed
me
to
read
and
highlite
the
thirty
articles
which
I
had
downloaded.
Luck
rears
its
beautiful
face,
for
if
I
didn't
have
to
wake
up
to
work,
I
certainly
would
have
slept
several
hours
more,
and
would
certainly
not
have
had
the
discipline
to
read
for
three
hours.
Unfortunately,
it
is
easier
for
Scooby,
Shaggy
and
Scrappy
to
close
the
feet
of
distance
between
them
that
it
is
for
me
to
block
out
everything
else
in
my
life
to
allow
the
details
of
the
paper
to
come
together
in
my
mind.
For
that
reason,
my
friends
and
other
social
conditions,
NCAA
basketball,
and
a
few
hours
at
the
gym
prevented
me
from
doing
any
more
work
on
the
paper
that
day.
I
was
in
a
huge
hole.
At
10
am
on
Sunday,
the
day
before
the
paper
was
due
I
found
myself
several
hours
behind
where
I
wanted
to
be
on
my
paper.
Fortunately
again,
I
spontaneously
woke
up
about
an
hour
before
I
was
planning
on
it.
After
showering,
and
organizing
my
paper,
I
walked
outside
to
get
lunch.
1
found
myself
in
the
middle
of
the
nicest
spring
weather
imaginable.
I
had
seven
pages
of
writing
ahead
of
me,
and
I
only
wanted
to
be
outside.
I
walked
to
my
brother's
dorm
(he
also
goes
to
Lafayette)
to
commiserate
as
he
also
had
a
paper
to
write.
Apparently
everyone
else
on
campus
was
enjoying
the
weather
more
than
I
could.
"Have
you
been
outside
today?"
I
said
to
my
brother
when
I
got
over
to
his
room.
"Yeah"
he
said
"Doesn't
anyone
on
this
campus
have
any
work
to
do?"
After
eating
lunch
in
my
brother's
room,
I
walked
back
to
my
room
(slowly)
and
began
writing
my
paper.
After
finally
writing
a
page,
I
decided
my
garbage
can
was
dirty,
and
needed
to
be
cleaned.
Since
I
had
no
sponges,
I
needed
to
walk
to
Wawa
to
get
them.
On
the
way
to
Wawa,
I
ran
into
a
friend
of
mine,
talked
to
him
for
15
minutes,
stopped
at
my
brother's
room,
stopped
at
Farinon
and
bought
a
Snapple
Iced
Tea.
Patiently
waited
in
line
at
Wawa
to
purchase
my
sponges
(I
have
never
been
so
patient
while
waiting
in
line
in
my
life)
and
slowly
walked
back
to
my
room.
When
I
returned
to
my
room,
I
actually
was
able
to
make
some
ground
on
my
paper,
finishing
about
four
of
the
required
six
pages.
The
paper
was
actually
taking
shape
in
my
mind
now,
and
I
realized
it
was
just
a
matter
of
discipline
before
I
finished
it.
Scooby
had
stopped,
and
had
been
rear
ended
by
Scrappy.
Shaggy
was
on
his
way.
With
about
a
page
remaining
in
my
paper,
the
clock
struck
(or
rather
digitally
flipped
to)
six
o'
clock.
"I'll
eat
dinner,
finish
the
paper,
watch
the
Simpsons,
revise
the
paper,
go
to
the
library
from
9:30
until
12
to
work,
and
then
I'll
be
able
to
relax"
I
thought.
I
should
have
figured
that
I
would
be
done
writing
for
the
day.
After
dinner,
I
decided
I
had
worked
hard
enough
for
a
while
(of
course
I
hadn't)
and
that
I
would
take
a
break
until
8:30
when
the
Simpsons
was
over.
After
that,
I
would
finish
the
paper,
work
until
midnight,
revise
the
paper
after
midnight,
and
then
be
done.
Then,
after
the
Simpsons
the
plan
changed
again.
I
would
watch
King
of
the
Hill,
write
from
9
until
9:30,
work
from
9:30
until
midnight,
finish
the
paper
after
midnight
and
then
revise
it
in
the
morning.
Then
after
King
of
the
Hill,
the
plan
changed
again.
I
would
clean
my
room
from
9
until
9:30,
work
from
9:30
until
12,
finish
the
paper
after
midnight,
and
wake
up
early
and
revise
it
in
the
morning.
Then
at
midnight,
the
plan
changed
again.
I
would
watch
TV
until
1
am,
go
to
bed,
wake
up
early,
finish
the
paper,
and
revise.
Yeah,
I
thought,
that
is
a
good
plan.
Luck
and
waking
up
came
into
effect
for
a
third
time
in
three
days
on
Monday
morning.
I
had
set
my
alarm
for
10am,
so
that
I
could
write
my
paper
for
an
hour
before
my
1
lam
class,
then
I
could
revise
it
and
print
it
between
12
and
1pm,
so
that
it
could
be
handed
in
at
1pm.
Again,
I
spontaneously
woke
up
well
before
when
I
had
set
my
alarm,
this
time
at
8:30am.
To
understand
how
freakish
this
was,
I
guarantee
that
these
were
the
only
two
times
all
semester
that
I
had
woken
up
before
my
alarm,
and
not
gone
back
to
sleep.
By
waking
up
early,
I
thought
that
I
would
be
able
to
comfortably
finish
my
paper
by
lpm.
After
showering
and
grabbing
some
breakfast
I
quickly
whipped
out
the
last
page
of
the
paper.
Following
my
typical
routine
for
writing
a
paper,
I
printed
out
that
paper,
and
read
it
for
any
ackwardly
worded
sentences,
poorly
articulated
ideas,
incomplete
sentences
and
spelling
errors
that
spell
check
might
not
have
picked
up.
After
this
I
make
my
corrections
and
print
out
the
final
copy.
Well,
as
I
was
proof
reading
the
first
copy
I
realized
that
I
had
made
a
hugely
time
consuming
error.
When
I
write
papers,
as
I
footnote,
instead
of
writing
in
the
documentation,
I
write
in
a
letter
or
number
that
corresponds
to
a
number
that
I
have
marked
the
article
with.
Well
as
I
read
the
paper,
I
realized
that
I
had
not
written
in
any
of
the
footnotes.
Since
their
were
about
forty
footnotes,
which
documented
about
thirty
different
articles.
This
would
take
at
least
an
hour.
Ironically
enough,
I
had
gotten
up
about
an
hour
earlier
than
I
had
planned
to.
After
making
my
corrections
from
reading
the
paper
the
first
time
through,
I
laboriously
typed
in
the
footnotes
and
printed
the
paper
out
as
I
left
for
my
1
lam
class.
Regrettably,
there
were
two
major
problems
with
my
printer:
First,
it
tends
to
skip
off
line.
When
this
happens,
it
stops
printing.
While
this
is
easily
remedied
by
simply
pressing
a
button,
someone
has
to
be
physically
present
to
press
this
button.
I
was
not
physically
present
to
press
this
button
when
my
printer
skipped
offline
after
printing
half
a
page.
When
I
returned
from
class
and
realized
my
problem,
I
was
quickly
reminded
of
the
second
problem
of
my
printer.
After
printing
about
four
lines,
it
pauses
for
about
fifteen
seconds.
This
can
be
quite
irritating,
as
a
six
page
paper
(or
like
mine,
which
had
jumped
to
eight
pages
with
the
footnotes)
can
take
forty
five
minutes
to
print.
I
impatiently
waited
while
my
printer
whirred
and
stuttered
until
eight
pages
were
finally
spit
out.
I
looked
at
the
clock.
It
said
1:08.
My
class
began
at
1:10.1
quickly
grabbed
the
paper,
double
checked
to
make
sure
the
paper
was
in
the
right
order,
and
stapled
the
pages
together.
I
looked
at
the
front
page
and
realized
that
I
had
no
cover
page.
The
clock
said
1:09.1
had
no
time
to
wait
for
my
printer
to
cough
up
a
cover
page,
so
I
grabbed
a
piece
of
computer
paper,
and
hand
wrote
a
cover
page.
Luckily
my
class
was
located
in
close
proximity
to
where
I
lived,
so
I
made
it
to
class
before
the
teacher
had
begun
to
collect
the
papers.
In
Scooby
Doo
cartoons,
after
Scooby,
Scrappy
and
Shaggy
encounter
the
ghost,
they
some
how
manage
to
escape
him,
solve
the
mystery
and
become
the
heroes.
After
things
look
bleakest,
the
boys
manage
to
come
out
on
top.
Cartoons,
and
most
Television
programs
thrive
on
this
predictability
or
people
would
not
watch
them.
Similarly,
no
matter
how
dire
the
circumstances
are
when
writing
a
paper,
no
matter
how
little
sleep
I
think
J
am
going
to
get,
or
bow
much
time
J
am
going
to
crunch,
I
always
know
that
J
will
end
up
not
only
finishing
the
paper,
but
finishing
it
successfully.
This
can
be
seen
in
this
paper
that
I
frenetically
wrote
in
those
forty
eight
hours.
While
I
endured
severe
crises
of
time
and
motivation.
I
never
once
had
a
crisis
of
confidence.
1
knew
that
what
I
was
writing
was
good
J
believe
that
this
confidence
gave
me
the
strength
to
overcome
the
other
obstacles
that
I
had
created
for
myself
Perhaps
I
subconsciously
created
these
crises
just
to
give
myself
a
challenge
as
I
wrote
the
paper.
As
it
is,
having
the
paper
returned
was
anticlimactic
compared
to
handing
it
in.
I
had
run
into
the
professor
about
a
week
after
I
handed
it
in,
and
about
a
week
before
it
was
handed
back
He
told
me
that
it
was
one
of
the
best
papers
in
the
class,
and
that
it
was
so
good
that
he
wanted
me
to
give
an
oral
presentation
on
it.
Once
again,
Scooby,
Scrappy
and
Shaggy
had
solved
the
crime
and
captured
the
villain.
