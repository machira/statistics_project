Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative
As
I
reflect
on
my
last
year,
I
realize
that
being
a
Writing
Associate
has
greatly
influenced
the
way
I
view
writing,
and
in
particular
student
writing.
Through
my
first
two
semesters
of
WA
work,
I
learned
what
aspects
attributed
to
a
good
conference,
and
why
a
good
conference
was
beneficial
to
both
the
student,
and
myself.
Additionally
I
had
to
adjust
to
working
with
my
peers
and
initially
struggled
to
find
a
comfortable
and
balanced
conference
environment
but
succeeded
by
considering
each
student
on
an
individual
basis.
During
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
I
worked
with
upperclassmen
in
an
Italian
art
history
course.
Because
this
was
my
first
assignment,
I
was
initially
nervous
about
the
fact
that
I
was
a
first
semester
sophomore,
and
most
of
my
students
were
juniors
and
seniors.
By
talking
to
each
student
in
conferences,
and
exploring
their
writing
style
and
personality,
I
learned
that
when
working
as
a
WA,
age
really
did
not
matter.
The
most
important
thing
for
me
was
establishing
a
personal
connection
with
each
student
and
working
to
remain
understanding
of
their
needs,
while
pushing
them
to
get
their
work
done,
well.
In
order
to
gain
the
studentsO
respect,
I
had
to
help
them
navigate
their
papers,
in
a
way
that
most
addressed
their
specific
concerns
and
difficulties.
After
the
initial
WA
training
I
had
what
I
thought
was
a
concrete
idea
of
how
a
conference
should
work
and
be
structured.
However,
I
soon
understood,
through
the
process
of
working
with
my
first
group
of
students,
that
each
conference
is
different
as
it
depends
on
the
student
and
how
best
to
serve
their
needs
while
creating
a
comfortable
environment.
For
example,
I
once
held
a
conference
over
dinner
with
a
friend
who
was
taking
the
class.
I
learned
that
she
worked
best
with
me
when
she
was
relaxed,
and
the
environment
was
informal,
and
Nfriendly.O
After
my
first
semester,
I
found
that
a
successful
conference
was
simply
one
when
the
student
was
able
to
take
something
away
that
they
found
useful
to
revising
their
paper,
or
even
something
that
impacted
their
writing
as
a
whole,
on
a
more
general
basis.
During
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
I
also
began
to
understand
the
importance
of
the
relationship
between
the
partner
professor
and
the
WA.
Unfortunately
my
relationship
with
the
partner
professor
was
quite
limited,
and
I
learned
that
this
lead
to
many
difficulties
in
communicating
properly
about
assignments
with
the
students.
The
students
in
the
course
were
way
behind
on
the
work,
and
the
professorOs
expectations
were
very
high.
Although
the
students
met
with
the
professor
to
discuss
concerns,
it
would
have
helped
for
me
to
meet
with
her
as
well.
In
my
second
semester
of
WA
work
I
was
assigned
to
a
VAST
course.
Unlike
my
first
semester
experience,
from
the
beginning
of
this
past
semester
I
worked
alongside
the
professor
and
communicated
with
him
throughout
the
semester
about
my
work
as
a
WA,
and
the
studentsO
work.
I
found
that
this
was
beneficial
to
me
as
well
as
to
the
students.
In
general
it
helped
everyone
to
stay
on
the
same
page,
and
to
share
a
mutual
understanding
of
what
was
expected
and
how
best
to
achieve
it
through
writing.
I
was
able
to
share
my
thoughts
about
how
the
conferences
were
progressing
as
well
as
what
students
were
showing
up,
and
which
were
not.
The
professor
and
I
were
also
able
to
discuss
how
to
help
students
who
were
grappling
with
understanding
the
assignment,
and
how
to
structure
their
papers.
I
feel
that
my
experience
this
past
semester
was
ultimately
shaped
and
greatly
enhanced
by
my
constant
communication
with
my
partner
professor.
Overall
I
learned
that
communication,
or
as
in
the
last
semester,
lack
thereof,
with
a
partner
professor
can
greatly
impact
the
experience
of
the
students
taking
the
course,
and
my
own
ability
to
assist
them.
The
students
taking
the
VAST
course
were
students
from
my
year,
and
I
found
that
with
them
it
was
important
to
ask
what
they
hoped
to
accomplish
during
the
conference
in
order
to
show
them
that
I
was
not
there
to
dictate
the
writing
process,
but
to
help
them
as
they
navigated
it.
As
I
continued
to
do
this,
I
was
able
to
see
that
by
letting
the
students
choose
what
they
wanted
to
address
during
the
conferences,
I
was
able
to
have
much
more
productive
conferences,
with
more
positive
outcomes
than
in
the
last
semester.
Beginning
to
see
that
most
students
were
eager
to
have
their
conferences,
and
had
begun
to
choose
areas
they
wanted
to
work
on
before
the
conference
was
very
rewarding.
Although
this
previous
semester
went
very
smoothly
as
a
whole,
there
were
individual
students
who
did
not
show
up
for
conferences.
I
found
this
to
be
the
most
frustrating
and
difficult
part
of
being
a
WA.
There
is
nothing
harder
than
trying
to
help
a
student
who
does
not
even
take
the
time
to
have
a
conference.
Unfortunately,
the
students
who
do
not
always
show
up
are
often
those
who
need
the
most
guidance
and
assistance
with
their
writing.
The
most
frustrating
conference
I
had
this
past
semester
was
with
a
student
who
had
missed
two
previous
conferences
and
constantly
rescheduled.
When
I
finally
met
with
this
student,
the
assignment
due
date
was
quickly
approaching
and
the
paper
needed
a
lot
of
work.
With
twenty
minutes
left
in
our
conference,
there
was
not
nearly
enough
time
to
help
the
student
with
everything
that
needed
attention.
From
this
experience
I
learned
that
sometimes
you
can
only
do
so
much,
and
as
a
WA
I
do
not
have
the
power
to
determine
the
productivity
and
commitment
of
a
student
to
their
writing.
The
choice
to
work
hard
and
to
utilize
conference
time
and
my
help
is
theirs,
and
they
must
make
it
themselves.
I
think
the
most
rewarding
thing
about
being
a
WA,
and
the
best
conference
experiences
I
have
had
are
those
when
I
am
able
to
see
the
progress
a
student
is
making
from
assignment
to
assignment.
It
is
so
reassuring
when
a
student
begins
to
understand
and
grow
as
a
writer
because
of
something
you
worked
on
together
in
a
conference.
For
example,
if
a
student
struggled
with
something
like
structuring
a
paper,
and
we
worked
on
it
in
a
conference,
it
is
incredible
to
witness
the
changes
that
they
make
on
their
writing
and
the
improvements
they
make
on
their
own,
in
subsequent
assignments.
I
think
that
after
working
with
students
on
a
regular
basis,
for
a
two
semesters,
I
learned
that
everyone
has
their
own
style
and
method
of
working
and
accomplishing
an
assignment.
This
helped
me
to
consider
my
own
writing,
and
the
idea
that
writing
is
a
continual
process
and
dialogue.
Sometimes
I
find
that
when
writing,
I
finish
something
and
make
a
few
changes,
and
am
happy
with
it.
However,
after
being
a
WA
I
feel
that
it
is
important
to
constantly
re-read
and
reconsider
my
own
writing,
and
to
engage
in
dialogues
with
both
professors
and
students.
The
most
important
thing
that
I
have
taken
away
is
that
each
person
who
reads
a
piece
of
writing
will
be
able
to
find
different
things
that
they
feel
are
strong,
and
different
areas
that
may
need
more
consideration
and
additional
work.
