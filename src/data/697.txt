I
remember
the
first
book
I
wrote.
I
had
drawn
pictures
of
different
creatures
that
lived
in
the
Arctic,
including
a
polar
bear,
krill,
and
a
penguin,
because
Mom
had
given
me
a
Learn
to
Draw
book
with
pictures
of
different
animals
in
it.
I
was
only
seven
or
eight,
but
even
I
could
read
the
four
sentences
under
each
picture
that
described
the
different
animalsO
characteristics.
I
copied
two
sentences
down
word
for
word
under
the
pictures
I
drew
in
my
book.
Then
I
colored
in
my
drawings.
Mom
helped
me
make
a
cover.
And
then
she
sewed
all
the
pages
together,
using
strands
of
green
floss
and
a
needle
to
bind
my
scattered
drawings
into
a
book.
We
still
have
it,
and
it
sits
on
the
shelf
next
to
all
the
childrenOs
books
Mom
read
me
throughout
my
childhood.
And
that
is
just
the
first
example
of
me
writing
what
I
read
in
other
books.
My
next
work
did
not
have
nearly
as
many
pictures,
and
none
of
its
pages
were
colored.
I
had
consumed
every
single
book
in
the
Little
Maid
series
(rather
boring
books
about
the
American
Revolution,
as
I
look
back
on
them
now),
and
then
I
read
them
again.
And
again.
And
again.
Finally,
I
got
a
pencil
and
a
journal
notebook
and
started
writing
my
own
American
Revolution
story,
complete
with
its
own
ten-year-old
heroine.
It
was
easy.
I
had
memorized
the
Little
Maid
story
template,
and
I
knew
how
the
story
needed
to
progress.
I
was
good
at
describing
the
muslin
dresses
the
heroines
wore,
dresses
with
pink
ribbons
and
blue
sashes
that
were
painstakingly
described
in
minute
detail.
And
I
was
good
at
making
sure
my
stories
did
not
have
sad
endings.
If
someone
was
shot
by
a
Redcoat
bullet,
that
person
would
be
sure
to
make
it
through.
Because
I
was
not
ready
to
accept
that
books
could
have
imperfect
characters
and
unhappy
endings.
This
was
a
plague
that
permeated
my
writing
for
years,
until
finally
I
was
able
to
escape
it
in
the
summer
of
my
17th
year.
But
that
was
not
until
I
had
written
story
after
story
in
which
main
characters
got
shot
only
to
survive,
were
poisoned
but
miraculously
recovered,
and
went
into
comas
only
to
emerge
unscathed
before
the
story
concluded.
Before
the
summer
of
2008,
I
was
never
ready
to
say
goodbye
to
characters.
Death
was
serious,
final,
and
something
felt
wrong
about
introducing
death
into
my
stories.
A
death
in
the
story
meant
irreversible
pain
for
those
characters
left
behind.
It
was
just
too
real.
For
instance,
I
was
unable
to
deal
with
it
in
the
story
my
friends
and
I
crafted
called
Dornthalia.
But
before
I
can
really
get
into
what
Dornthalia
actually
was,
I
have
to
explain
a
few
things.
Like,
I
was
homeschooled
until
I
went
to
Lafayette
College.
I
took
online
classes
from
a
billion,
okay,
it
was
more
like
four,
online
high
schools,
picking
and
choosing
what
courses
to
take
throughout
four
years
of
home-school
high
school.
And
one
of
those
high
schools
was
called
Regina
Coeli.
Latin,
for
Queen
of
the
Heaven.
It
was
a
Catholic
school.
And
Regina
Coeli,
or
RC,
had
these
really
awesome
message
boards
for
the
students
to
use,
so
that
we
could
get
to
know
each
other.
The
message
boards
were
all
on
an
online
forum
site
for
students
only.
We
needed
a
user
name
and
password
(provided
by
the
school)
just
to
enter
the
site.
One
day,
when
I
was
surfing
around
these
forums,
I
found
one
called
RPG.
Well,
I
had
no
idea
what
that
even
meant,
but
that
soon
changed.
RPG
stands
for
Role
Playing
Game,
and
RC
Academy
gave
RPGs
a
special
twist.
The
RPG
threads
on
the
RPG
forum
were
really
just
collaborative
stories,
written
by
many
different
authors.
Every
personOs
post
became
an
integral
part
of
the
story.
Each
story
had
its
own
rules
and
regulations,
formulated
by
the
storyOs
authors.
For
instance,
a
person
could
not
post
twice
in
a
row.
Characters
were
not
permitted
to
talk
for
other
characters.
Characters
could
not
kill
each
other.
I
was
intrigued,
and
I
checked
out
the
different
RPGs
until
I
found
one
that
sparked
my
interest.
It
was
a
fantasy
RPG
reminiscent
of
J.R.R.
TolkeinOs
Lord
of
the
Rings.
And
when
I
found
it,
my
eyes
lit
up
when
I
thought
of
how
much
fun
writing
a
story
like
this
could
be.
I
can
still
remember
the
character
I
created
for
this
gameNKiara.
Blue
eyed
blonde
haired
Kiara
was
a
rider
and
an
archer,
a
fierce
warrior
whose
parents
had
been
killed
in
a
fire
set
by
(as
it
unfolded
later
in
the
story)
another
writerOs
character,
the
cruel,
yet
entrancing,
Baritrahanu.
Kiara
was
bent
on
revenge
throughout
the
story,
and
she
allied
with
a
dragon
and
a
dwarf,
in
her
search
for
Baritrahanu
and
revenge.
The
dragon
and
dwarf
characters
were
authored
by
a
girl
from
Louisiana,
Laura,
whom
I
had
met
in
one
of
my
classes
at
RC.
I
became
really
close
friends
with
after
we
had
both
been
posting
in
Dornthalia
for
a
while.
Laura
and
I
started
calling
each
other
once
a
week,
and
although
we
talked
about
a
lot
of
different
things,
as
long
as
Dornthalia
existed,
we
strategized
about
how
to
write
our
next
posts
and
how
to
conclude
the
story
with
the
best
possible
ending.
WeOre
still
friends
today,
she
called
me
a
few
weeks
ago
to
catch
up
before
we
both
go
back
to
college.
Dornthalia
was
really
the
first
time
I
posted
anything
I
had
written
in
public
for
other
people
to
read.
It
wasnOt
so
much
about
the
grammar
and
the
structure
of
what
we
wrote
as
it
was
about
the
story
that
we
were
creating
together.
When
it
finally
came
time
for
Dornthalia
to
end,
we
authors
were
so
attached
to
our
characters
that,
despite
rules
that
in
the
final
round
of
battle
characters
actually
had
to
die
if
the
injuries
inflicted
on
them
by
another
were
reasonable
and
severe
enough
to
cause
death,
our
characters
clung
to
life,
evading
maces,
dodging
arrows,
and
surviving
bloody
wounds.
I
remember
that
in
the
last
several
posts,
I
made
my
character
Kiara
declare
her
love
for
Baritrahanu,
following
which,
after
some
more
fighting,
Kiara
and
Baritrahanu
collapsed
next
to
each
other.
But
like
I
said
before,
I
was
still
unable
to
accept
death
in
my
stories,
so
I
made
sure
Kiara
survived
against
all
odds.
At
the
same
time
I
was
involved
in
Dornthalia,
around
the
year
2005
or
2006,
I
was
also
writing
my
own
fictional
stories,
which
ranged
from
150
to
250
pages
typed.
One
was
about
mock
trial,
something
I
knew
a
lot
about
because
my
dad
was
a
mock
trial
coach
and
because
I
was
on
a
mock
trial
team
in
high
school.
The
next
story
I
wrote
involved
environmental
issues
and
pollution.
When
I
wrote
that
story,
I
was
a
student
liaison
to
the
Ocean
City
Environmental
Commission,
and
I
also
had
read
a
healthy
dose
of
Clive
Cussler,
whose
marine
biologist
characters
were
among
my
favorite
literary
creations.
And
then
when
I
was
17,
I
wrote
about
New
York
in
the
late
1890s,
a
time
I
was
fascinated
with
because
of
political
corruption,
the
infusion
of
immigrants
from
Europe,
and
the
wealth
possessed
by
the
few
and
fortunate.
The
New
York
story
is
my
favorite
of
everything
that
IOve
written.
Because
in
this
story,
I
finally
realized
that
everything
I
wrote
couldnOt
have
a
happy
ending.
Life
is
not
perfect,
and
I
did
not
want
my
characters
or
stories
to
be
either.
One
of
the
main
characters,
Margo,
dies
about
half
way
through
the
story,
and
her
death
haunts
the
other
characters.
At
the
end
of
the
story,
the
main
character
Lily
ends
up
engaged
to
her
long-time
beau
and
enemy
James.
But
James
is
still
in
love
with
Margo,
and
Lily
is
in
love
with
an
immigrant
who
also
was
killed
in
a
riot.
Both
of
them
become
alcohol
abusers
to
cope
with
their
losses,
and
despite
their
vast
wealth
and
the
opportunities
they
have
in
the
future,
when
the
story
ends
Lily
and
James
are
both
deeply
unhappy.
I
learned
that
for
a
fictional
story
to
really
say
something,
for
a
story
to
have
meaning,
the
story
has
to
evoke
emotion
in
the
reader.
It
must
make
the
reader
think.
And
in
order
to
do
so,
the
story
must
have
characters
that
the
reader
can
love,
empathize
with,
or
dislike.
When
the
reader
closes
the
book
and
places
it
back
on
the
shelf,
she
should
feel
something.
A
story
should
have
characters
that
are
affected
by
the
events
that
happen
throughout
the
story,
with
reactions
to
those
events
that
are
realistic
and,
even
if
it
is
just
in
some
small
way,
relatable.
Even
though
the
story
is
fictional,
the
starring
characters
and
their
emotions
have
to
be
realistic.
In
real
life,
stories
do
not
have
happy
endings.
People
are
not
perpetually
happy.
And
this
makes
experiencing
happiness
so
much
more
special.
When
I
read,
I
want
to
challenge
myself
by
reexamining
my
preconceptions.
And
I
want
my
writing
to
excite
the
same
kind
of
intellectual
exploration.
Unfortunately
for
me,
a
lot
of
the
writing
IOve
completed
is
not
creative.
Like
most
students
at
Lafayette,
IOve
spent
a
good
amount
of
time
at
school
writing,
whether
it
was
papers,
homework
assignments,
or
exam
short
answer
and
essay
questions.
In
some
ways,
IOve
found
school
writing,
especially
writing
papers,
to
be
different
from
the
creative
writing
I
enjoy
so
much.
It
is
so
much
harder
for
me
to
write
an
essay
on
Portia
in
the
Merchant
of
Venice
than
it
is
for
me
to
create
my
own
story
about
life
in
16th
c.
England.
So
to
make
it
easier,
I
bring
my
passion
for
story-telling
to
the
papers
I
write.
One
of
the
most
important
aspects
of
any
story
is
in
its
tellingNhow
it
flows
from
one
section
to
another
and
the
effortlessness
of
this
flow.
This
applies
to
papers
and
to
short
stories,
essays
and
novelettes
alike.
Getting
a
flow
of
ideas
down
on
a
page
in
an
organized
fashion
is,
for
me,
the
most
important
step
in
writing
a
good
piece.
And
because
writing
in
most
of
my
classes
involves
multiple
sources,
one
of
my
goals
while
writing
has
been
to
integrate
those
sources,
while
citing
them
properly,
seamlessly
into
my
papers.
I
also
consider
what
I
think
of
as
the
interesting-factor
when
IOm
working
on
an
assignment
for
school.
IOm
not
going
to
say
that
all
of
the
topics
IOve
written
about
for
classes
have
been
riveting
ones,
or
even
ones
that
I
have
been
personally
invested
in.
But
that
does
not
mean
that
I
should
throw
in
the
towel
and
make
what
I
perceive
to
be
a
boring
subject
even
more
boring.
Any
fictional
story
has
to
capture
a
readerOs
interest
for
it
to
be
worthwhile,
and
I
donOt
want
my
professors
to
fall
asleep
when
they
are
reading
my
papers.
Even
if
IOm
writing
about
the
driest
topic
ever,
I
want
to
make
it
interesting,
and
I
find
I
can
do
this
if
I
focus
on
diction,
sentence
structure,
and
set-up.
IOm
not
saying
that
this
is
a
perfect
way
to
attack
writing
for
school,
but
I
know
that
it
helps
keep
me
engaged
in
and
focused
on
my
writing.
When
IOm
finished
with
my
paper
and
turn
it
in,
I
feel
that
I
put
effort
not
only
into
getting
my
ideas
across,
but
also
getting
them
across
in
an
easy
to
read,
attractive
format.
At
least,
thatOs
what
I
try
to
do.
I
donOt
have
the
time
to
write
like
I
used
to.
But
when
IOve
had
a
really
bad
day,
I
pull
out
this
little
blue
book
my
mom
gave
me
a
few
years
ago.
ItOs
full
of
quickly
jotted
down
poems.
ItOs
just
me,
thinking
out
loud.
ItOs
not
always
easy,
putting
down
what
I
feel,
but
it
makes
it
better.
ItOs
as
if
that
little
blue
book
and
the
poems
scratched
inside
help
me
sort
out
my
thoughts
enough
for
me
to
make
it
through
another
day.
IOve
come
a
long
way
since
my
floss-bound
copy
of
Arctic
Animals,
but
the
love
of
writing
IOve
had
ever
since
I
was
a
little
kid
is
still
going
strong.
And
itOs
a
good
thing,
too.
Because
I
donOt
know
what
IOd
do
without
it.
