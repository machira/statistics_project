From
"Dear
Daddy"
to
Othello:
A
Literacy
Narrative
Gripping
the
tat
pencil
in
my
left
hand,
1
began
writing
with
the
trademark
backward
slant
of
a
southpaw.
I
can
still
remember
the
grey
paper
with
the
blue
and
red
dotted
lines
that
left
an
airport
for
my
humble
attempts
at
letter
formation.
My
first
grade
teacher
watched
us
labor
over
our
little
assignment--a
short
letter
to
our
parents.
Since
I
never
had
the
occasion
to
meet
my
father,
my
six-year-old
mind
thought
that
writing
him
a
letter
would
be
an
excellent
idea.
Showing
my
mother
the
finished
product,
on
the
other
hand,
brought
her
to
tears,
as
she
looked
at
the
crooked
letters
that
spelled
out
"Dear
Daddy"
and
cried.
The
emotional
response
that
this
piece
of
writing
elicited
is
probably
why
this
is
the
first
writing
experience
I
can
recall.
Perhaps
it
made
me
aware
of
how
writing
was
a
powerful
tool
that
would
almost
always
make
some
kind
of
impression.
As
I
moved
on
through
elementary
school,
the
spaces
between
the
lines
on
the
paper
gradually
grew
smaller.
Writing
was
centered
less
on
the
physical
act
of
creating
manuscript
and
more
on
the
actual
application
of
those
dexterity
skills
Creating
a
proper
sentence
that
made
sense
was
more
important
than
the
precise
formation
of
letters
within
a
word.
I
remember
receiving
weekly
word
lists
in
fourth
grade,
each
with
twenty
words.
Miss
Keller's
assignment
was
sometimes
to
write
sentences
using
our
new-found
vocabulary,
but
she
usually
asked
us
to
write
a
short
story
and
"challenged"
(bribed)
us
to
write
the
best
story
we
could
using
all
the
words.
Every
week
she
picked
someone's
story
as
the
best
and
made
him
read
it
aloud
to
the
class.
The
real
reward
was
a
chance
for
the
winner
to
choose
something
from
"the
vault",
a
box
which
contained
everything
from
shiny
pencils
to
cartoon
character
eraser
tops.
My
teachers
were
always
impressed
with
my
sentences
and
my
stories,
and
I
never
heard
any
constructive
comments.
Perhaps
my
teachers
never
had
anything
bad
to
say
about
the
writing
of
the
top
students
in
the
class
because
those
with
inferior
skills
would
have
been
left
with
a
lower
opinion
of
themselves.
Or
perhaps
my
skills,
although
not
perfectly
refined,
were
"plenty
good
enough"
for
a
fourth
grader.
I
do
remember
trying
to
create
the
longest
sentences
with
the
biggest
words
I
knew
so
that
1
could
best
impress
my
teachers.
Caring
more
about
making
myself
shine
than
about
the
actual
stories
I
was
writing,
I
even
recall
trying
to
make
my
writing
distinctive
by
using
unusual
names
for
characters
and
by
setting
scenes
in
real
but
far-off
places
I
had
heard
of--like
Buenos
Aries
or
Czechoslovakia.
1
once
wrote
a
story
about
a
girl
named
Aphrodite
who
lived
in
Helsinki
and
gave
her
boyfriend
roses
at
the
restaurant
on
top
of
the
Eiffel
Tower
when
they
were
on
their
honeymoon
in
Paris.
I
remember
watching
it
get
posted
to
the
bulletin
board
and
later
putting
the
ugly
green
sheets
of
paper
on
our
refrigerator
at
home
for
all
to
see.
My
mother
probably
still
has
that
prize-winning
piece
of
classic
literature
tucked
away
in
a
box
somewhere.
1
suppose
1
was
a
bit
confident
and
showy
as
a
fourth
grade
writer.
But
when
1
think
about
it
now,
how
many
of
us
would
tell
a
ten-year-old
to
tone
down
his
wi
lting?
Throughout
elementary
school,
writing
was
almost
always
done
in
class,
sitting
upright
in
an
uncomfortable
chair.
But
in
junior
high,
as
assignments
grew
longer,
class
time
was
too
limited.
Writing
short
compositions,
book
reports,
and
stories
could
now
be
done
easily
at
home.
And
for
those
very
special
occasions,
1
asked
my
grandfather
to
dust
off
the
old
manual
typewriter
so
that
those
assignments
would
have
that
professional
touch
1
needed
as
a
seventh
grader.
Pecking
away
slowly
at
the
keys,
I
typed
short
reports
about
civics
and
music
and
earth
science
and
geography.
But
none
of
these
assignments
were
very
formal;
it
didn't
matter
where
I
put
my
title
or
how
1
numbered
the
pages.
And
there
was
certainly
no
need
for
anything
as
impressively
foreign
as
parenthetical
notations
or
a
bibliography--at
least
not
until
Mrs.
Kelshaw
assigned
our
ninth
grade
English
class
the
"official"
research
paper,
a
joint
project
with
our
biology
class.
1
remember
thinking,
"Eight
typed
pages?!
She
must
be
on
crack
"
It
seemed
as
though
every
topic
I
proposed
was,
in
her
words,
"far
too
broad";
she
finally
agreed
that
I
could
write
about
new
treatments
for
cystic
fibrosis.
Then
our
class
was
introduced
to
the
fat
grey
MLA
handbook,
something
that
none
of
us
had
ever
seen
before.
Its
scripture-like
status
loomed
over
us
as
my
teacher
explained
the
importance
of
following
all
its
rules.
"This
is
how
they
do
it
in
college,"
she
declared.
A
little
timid,
but
looking
forward
to
the
challenge
of
doing
work
"college-style",
I
made
a
trip
to
the
public
library
to
do
research.
Writing
had
never
before
required
this
level
of
preparation,
and
1
quickly
saw
that
I
not
only
had
to
write
the
paper,
but
also
had
to
brainstorm,
find
source
materials,
and
then
read
a
great
deal
more
than
I
had
expected.
As
the
project
took
shape,
1
began
to
see
how
writing
from
now
on
had
to
be
a
multi-faceted
process
that
meant
more
than
sitting
down
with
a
pen
in
hand
on
my
comfortable
bed.
I
worked
through
my
cystic
fibrosis
paper,
spending
a
good
deal
of
time
writing
each
individual
paragraph,
engineering
every
little
detail
of
the
paper
to
fit
the
specified
guidelines.
I
was
proud
of
my
finished
paper,
proud
of
the
time
I
had
spent
in
preparation
(most
of
which
was
outside
of
class),
and
proud
of
the
fat
red
"95"
the
appeared
at
the
top
of
it.
While
this
sort
of
structured
academic
writing
continued
each
year
in
high
school,
1
finally
had
the
chance
to
sign
up
for
a
creative
writing
class
my
senior
year.
The
first
day
of
school,
Mrs.
Jackson
handed
each
of
us
a
journal
and
told
us
to
decorate
it,
to
personalize
it,
and
to
make
it
completely
our
own.
This
little
spiral
notebook
would
become
a
special
place
for
us
to
write
every
single
day
in
class
for
at
least
fifteen
minutes
about
all
sorts
of
topics.
Short
in-class
writing
assignments
were
balanced
with
larger
out-of-class
projects.
Sometimes
we
wrote
typical
short
story
and
poetry
fare,
but
those
common
assignments
were
offset
by
everything
from
commercial
scripts
to
word
collages.
Writing
poetry
gained
much
appeal
because
there
were
virtually
no
rules;
it
could
be
written
anywhere,
anytime,
and
about
any
topic.
Love,
death,
French
onion
soup,
and
the
color
magenta
were
all
viable
subject
matter.
In
fact,
poetiy
(as
well
as
other
forms
of
creative
writing)
was
sometimes
the
hardest
type
of
writing
because
it
challenged
convention.
There
was
no
handbook
to
follow,
and
it
seemed
that
the
meaning
behind
the
writing
took
on
a
greater
importance
than
the
specific
format
and
organization.
All
the
things
that
were
"essentials"
in
academic
writing
were
optional
or
even
out-of-place
in
creative
works.
The
strong
grammar
skills
and
precise
structure
of
academic
writing
that
were
drilled
into
us
in
most
other
writing
classes
were
necessary
but
secondary
to
innovation,
improvisation,
and
ideas.
While
my
more
"academic"
classes
in
high
school
showed
me
the
formal
process
of
writing,
creative
writing
helped
to
put
writing
in
perspective
and
forced
me
to
question
what
it
was
all
about
anyway.
Before
that,
1
had
never
really
considered
what
was
so
important
about
analyzing
a
poem
by
Walt
Whitman
or
why
The
Picture
of
Dorian
Gray
was
a
fascinating
novel
after
all.
My
experience
with
Mrs.
Jackson's
creative
writing
class
broadened
my
range
as
a
writer
and
gave
me
the
courage
to
strike
out
on
my
own
in
later
academic
writing--to
try
different
and
innovative
approaches
to
expressing
the
ideas
behind
the
words,
which
turned
out
to
be
the
most
important
part
of
writing
anyway.
Although
each
year
of
high
school
did
add
a
layer
of
complexity
to
my
understanding
of
and
approach
to
academic
writing,
teachers
always
handed
back
papers
with
a
big
red
"A+"
or
a
sweeping
"100"
written
across
the
top.
I
knew
that
writing
in
college
couldn't
be
that
easy.
Even
so,
I
felt
prepared
for
college
writing
because
1
felt
I
had
at
least
a
sound
basis
for
improvement--a
good
grasp
of
fundamentals
of
structure
and
form
along
with
good
grammar
and
a
strong
vocabulary.
I
also
carried
with
me
the
multi-dimensional
thinking
I
learned
from
creative
writing.
Expecting
more
of
a
challenge
from
college
writing,
I
came
prepared
to
work
hard.
But
I
never
realized
the
challenge
would
be
in
rereading,
revising,
editing,
changing,
experimenting,
and
making
a
first
draft
a
messy,
confusing
conglomeration
of
arrows
and
symbols
that
only
I
could
understand.
Computers
became
the
universal
standard
for
paper-writing,
and
1
learned
to
"cut
and
paste"
with
my
eyes
shut.
The
high
grades
on
papers
still
appeared,
but
only
as
a
product
of
many
nights
spent
staring
at
a
bright
white
screen
in
the
Alumni
Hall
of
Engineering
computer
laboratory.
Many
evenings
found
me
there,
armed
with
my
Tori
Amos
CD's,
my
headphones,
and
contraband
snack
food
and
water
tucked
away
in
my
backpack.
Writing
became
a
job,
and
1
took
it
more
seriously
than
the
calculus
problems
to
which
1
churned
out
answers
while
chatting
on
the
phone
before
going
to
bed.
Unlike
in
high
school,
professors'
comments
were
actually
food
for
thought
and
amounted
to
more
than
a
few
words
on
the
last
page.
I
remember
looking
at
all
the
blue
ink
on
the
first
draft
of
a
paper
I
had
written
at
the
beginning
of
my
first-year
seminar.
"She
hates
my
writing,"
I
assumed
before
reading
the
comments.
I
was
working
through
an
analysis
of
a
poem,
and
1
remember
handing
in
the
draft
while
I
patted
myself
on
the
back
for
thinking
I
did
an
excellent
job.
What
1
found
out
was
that
my
first
attempt
was
a
good
framework
of
ideas;
I
just
needed
to
deepen
my
analysis,
sharpen
my
thesis,
and
force
myself
to
examine
the
poem
from
every
possible
angle--even
asking
other
people
what
they
thought
about
it.
Although
1
knew
writing
was
a
gradual
process,
I
was
finally
able
to
watch
a
paper
take
shape,
paragraph
by
paragraph.
Because
I
did
receive
a
strong
background
in
writing
at
my
high
school,
1
didn't
have
too
many
problems
doing
what
was
necessary
to
succeed.
But
it
was
also
in
my
first
year
at
Lafayette
that
I
learned
a
bit
of
humility.
My
friends
came
to
respect
my
writing,
and
often
asked
for
help,
assuming
that
everything
1
wrote
would
always
receive
an
"A".
And
1
must
admit
to
being
rather
sure
of
myself
I
was
not
used
to
hearing
people
say
anything
bad
about
my
writing.
Even
an
assignment
completed
slightly
below
par
was
still
a
fairly
solid
piece
of
writing
for
a
freshman.
That's
why
I
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
"B-"
\
received
on
a
paper
for
my
Literary
Questions
class.
I
completed
the
first
paper
of
the
semester
with
flying
colors
and
was
proud
of
my
hard-earned
"A".
Our
second
assignment
was
a
paper
on
Othello,
a
text
with
which
I
felt
quite
comfortable.
I
gathered
my
ideas,
sat
down
to
write
the
paper
late
one
night,
revising
and
reworking
it
until
the
due
date,
when
I
handed
in
what
1
felt
was
an
incisive
expose
on
gender
in
Othello.
Well,
that
wasn't
quite
what
my
professor
thought,
and
I
was
unhappy
with
my
grade.
What
bothered
me
most
was
that
I
had
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
writing
and
revising
a
paper
that
paled
in
comparison
to
my
other
essays.
A
few
days
later,
before
we
I
started
working
on
our
next
essay
assignment,
I
pulled
out
the
infamous
Othello
paper
and
took
a
closer
look.
I
reread
the
assignment,
looked
over
our
class
discussion
notes,
and
asked
some
of
my
friends
specific
questions
about
their
take
on
my
paper.
I
saw
that
my
professor's
comments
were
valid:
I
didn't
push
my
discussion
far
enough
or
discuss
the
implications
of
the
ideas
I
presented.
After
I
dissected
and
scrutinized
the
paper,
1
saw
that
I
hardly
even
answered
the
questions
the
assignment
posed
in
the
first
place.
Although
I
had
to
deal
with
the
blow
of
a
lower
grade
than
normal,
I
value
that
experience
with
college
writing
more
than
any
other
so
far.
As
a
more
mature
writer,
1
learn
something
new
about
the
writing
process
from
every
assignment
I
complete,
regardless
of
the
grade
I
receive.
I
look
in
retrospect
on
the
way
I
saw
writing
in
elementary
school,
and
I
see
how
my
concept
has
evolved
from
a
physical
act
of
creation
to
a
character-building,
intriguing
process
that
I
will
never
understand
completely.
J
am
anxious
to
see
how
my
experience
as
a
writing
associate
will
affect
my
own
writing.
Will
it
make
me
more
aware
of
my
own
problems?
Will
reading
numerous
papers
for
the
same
class
show
me
how
the
similar
topics
can
be
presented
in
different
wTays?
1
hope
it
will.
The
biggest
lesson
1
learned
as
a
writer
at
Lafayette
is
that
every
work
is
a
work
in
progress--even
this
literacy
narrative,
