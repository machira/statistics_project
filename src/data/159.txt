Writing
Associate
Paper
8/28/98
When
I
attempt
to
look
back
on
the
earliest
experiences
I
have
had
with
writing,
I
realize
that
at
a
very
early
age
writing
was
an
integral
part
of
my
education.
As
early
as
kindergarten
I
was
learning
useful
tools
that
would
help
me
to
read
and
write.
With
each
passing
year
it
was
apparent
that
writing
would
become
a
vital
part
of
my
life.
When
I
think
of
what
writing
is
now,
my
earliest
experiences
do
not
seem
to
really
be
writing
experiences,
but
they
were.
Learning
to
say
and
write
the
alphabet
certainly
constitutes
as
part
of
the
writing
experience.
It
was
this
tool
that
began
the
life-long
journey
into
writing.
Although
I
am
not
exactly
sure
when
my
first
writing
experience
occurred,
I
do
have
several
early
memories
concerning
writing.
In
kindergarten
I
remember
making
an
alphabet
book.
It
was
the
first
book
that
I
ever
wrote
and
it
only
consisted
of
a
capital
letter
and
lowercase
letter
and
a
picture
of
something
that
began
with
the
same
letter.
For
example,
the
C
page
would
have
the
letters
C
and
c
in
the
top
corner
and
a
picture
of
a
cat
on
the
page.
In
order
to
write,
you
must
learn
the
alphabet
and
several
words
to
help
you
write
sentences.
Another
early
experience
I
remember
also
occurred
in
kindergarten.
Although
I
myself
did
not
write
the
story,
I
dictated
to
the
teacher
who
wrote
what
I
said
and
I
drew
pictures
to
go
along
with
it.
The
earliest
experiences
with
writing
seemed
to
be
mostly
creative.
As
I
gained
more
and
more
knowledge
about
the
details
of
writing,
the
assignments
became
more
and
more
difficult.
Instead
of
using
personal
experience
as
the
base
of
an
entire
paper,
I
would
be
asked
to
use
personal
experience
while
writing
a
formal,
critical
argumentative
paper.
It
was
at
this
point
that
I
realized
that
writing
was
not
only
used
to
tell
a
story,
but
also
as
a
means
of
voicing
an
opinion.
In
order
to
create
an
effective
and
persuasive
argument
rules
were
preached
to
students
year
after
year.
Writing
is
a
part
of
everyone's
life,
but
despite
basic
similarities,
the
art
of
writing
is
unique
to
each
individual.
For
some,
writing
comes
naturally
and
others
must
work
extremely
hard
at
finding
their
own
personal
writing
style.
When
I
look
back
on
my
writing
experiences
over
the
years,
I
look
back
favorably,
but
I
know
that
throughout
the
years
my
sister
has
despised
writing
and
struggled
with
writing
assignments.
Coming
to
college
I
realized
how
unique
each
persons
educational
experiences
were
and
how
those
differences
affected
the
way
they
write.
I
have
always
enjoyed
writing.
I
think
my
love
for
writing
stemmed
from
two
things;
first,
my
love
of
reading
and
second,
my
love
for
drama
and
story
telling.
My
earliest
memories
about
writing
all
seem
to
revolve
around
personal
experiences.
In
elementary
school,
I
learned
to
write
by
telling
or
repeating
stories.
Every
first
day
of
school
from
first
grade
through
sixth
grade
I
remember
writing
about
my
summer
vacation.
I
enjoyed
writing
about
good,
positive,
fun
experiences
and
that
seemed
to
be
how
I
first
learned
to
write.
I
have
always
loved
telling
stories
and
writing
was
just
a
different
way
to
tell
a
story,
at
first.
Obviously,
as
I
matured
so
did
my
writing.
Writing
for
pleasure
and
for
the
purpose
of
revealing
a
story
quickly
passed
and
I
was
forced
to
research
or
read
to
write
a
paper.
For
some
who
may
have
initially
enjoyed
writing,
this
may
have
been
a
point
where
it
took
a
turn
for
the
worst.
Although
I
loved
writing
stories,
I
found
that
I
loved
writing
formal
papers
and
essays
even
more.
I
loved
having
to
do
research
as
long
I
was
the
one
able
to
select
the
research
topic.
Again
the
different
genres
of
writing
reveal
how
people
look
at
writing
very
differently.
While
I
enjoyed
writing
early
on,
I
soon
found
myself
much
better
at
writing
formally
than
I
was
at
writing
about
personal
experiences.
The
most
difficult
genre
for
me
to
master,
but
the
one
I
have
grown
to
love
the
most
is
critical
writing.
High
school
was
the
first
time
I
really
had
to
spend
lengthy
amounts
of
time
writing
my
papers.
Critical
writing
took
the
longest
time
to
master,
but
has
become
the
most
beneficial
in
the
end.
The
way
I
look
at
critical
writing
is
almost
as
a
combination
of
the
two
earlier
methods.
In
order
to
effectively
write
critically,
you
must
be
able
to
incorporate
personal
experiences
and
beliefs
into
a
paper
that
is
based
on
fact,
research
or
readings.
I
truly
feel
that
I
was
well
educated
in
writing
because
when
it
came
time
to
write
critical
papers,
I
was
able
to
combine
the
skills
I
had
learned
from
previous
writing
experiences
to
create
a
critical
essay.
My
senior
year
of
high
school
I
decided
to
add
a
creative
writing
class
to
my
schedule.
Obviously,
every
year
I
had
to
take
an
English
class.
As
I
mentioned
earlier,
high
school
writing
consisted
mostly
of
critical
papers
so
when
I
took
creative
writing
senior
year,
I
was
in
for
a
very
big
surprise.
For
the
first
time,
I
found
out
the
kind
of
writing
that
is
most
difficult
for
me.
The
class
met
five
days
a
week
for
forty-five
minutes
each
day.
We
learned
to
write
poems,
short
stories
and
essays.
Essays,
I
could
handle,
short
stories
and
poems
are
a
whole
other
story.
I
found
out
that
I
am
not
a
poet.
Although,
it
was
impossible
to
fail
this
type
of
class,
I
found
myself
struggling
and
working
very
hard
to
come
up
with
creative
things
to
write
about.
It
was
one
of
the
classes
that
I
found
the
most
challenging
and
time
consuming.
In
addition
to
learning
the
skills
to
writing
in
all
different
genres,
this
class
was
also
in
charge
of
publishing
the
high
school's
literary
magazine.
Most
of
the
work
in
the
magazine
was
written
by
students
in
the
creative
writing
class,
but
several
other
students
submitted
work
as
well.
This
was
the
first
time
my
writing
was
ever
published.
It
was
at
this
time
that
I
was
introduced
to
another
aspect
of
writing;
editing.
I
was
a
co-editor
of
the
literary
magazine
and
found
out
what
a
great
skill
I
had.
Editing
the
magazine
took
a
lot
of
time
and
a
lot
of
effort,
but
in
the
end
well
worth
it.
I
noticed
my
own
papers
improving
and
I
enjoyed
watching
other
students
papers
expand.
I
am
hoping
to
gain
the
same
kind
of
experience
this
semester
as
a
writing
associate.
The
next
milestone
in
the
writing
process
was
definitely
coming
to
college
and
taking
the
first-year
seminar.
Although
this
course
was
at
eight
in
the
morning
it
was
my
favorite
class
that
semester.
I
had
to
write
more
than
I
had
ever
written
before,
and
I
loved
it.
This
course
and
one
other
that
I
took
that
first
semester
improved
my
writing
more
that
one
year
than
all
other
years
combined.
I
succeeded
in
the
class,
but
I
worked
hard
in
order
to
do
so.
I
felt
well-prepared
by
my
English
teachers
from
high
school,
but
that
did
not
mean,
I
knew
it
all.
I
learned
a
lot
about
grammar
and
using
structure
for
effect.
The
skills
I
learned
in
those
first
classes
have
made
me
the
writer
I
am
today.
In
my
first
year
seminar
class
I
was
asked
by
my
professor
to
submit
one
of
my
papers
to
a
competition.
I
was
so
excited
and
surprised
when
this
occurred,
I
instantly
was
on
the
phone
with
my
parents.
My
parents
have
always
been
very
supportive
when
it
comes
to
my
writing.
My
mother
is
a
teacher
and
it
is
obvious
to
me
how
much
she
has
influenced
and
helped
my
writing.
Although
I
had
been
asked
before
to
submit
or
publish
my
papers,
I
was
very
excited
that
as
a
freshmen
in
college
a
professor
found
my
work
good
enough
for
a
college
level
competition.
I
thought
I
was
excited
until
I
called
home.
I
often
read
my
papers
over
the
phone
to
my
mother;
I
appreciate
her
opinion
and
it
is
also
a
chance
for
me
to
hear
the
paper
being
read
aloud.
She
knew
exactly
which
paper
my
professor
liked
so
much
because
she
was
impressed
with
it
as
well.
Despite
the
fact
that
I
did
not
win
the
competition,
I
learned
a
lot
from
the
experience.
The
forms
of
writing
I
have
discussed
have
all
been
used
in
the
academic
environment.
There
are
several
other
times
in
my
life
where
writing
has
been
important
outside
of
education.
I
have
kept
a
journal
since
the
seventh
grade.
Although
I
do
not
write
as
frequently
as
I
used
to,
writing
in
a
journal
is
a
form
of
release
for
me.
I
remember
being
assigned
to
write
in
journals
and
not
enjoying
it
because
it
wasn't
completely
personal.
The
reason
I
enjoy
journal
writing
so
much
is
because
it
is
so
free;
I
don't
have
to
concentrate
on
grammar,
punctuation
or
structure.
Another
great
aspect
about
journal
writing
is
that
it
is
most
often
hand
written
which
obviously
is
more
personal
than
a
typed
paper.
Writing
is
a
process
which
began
at
a
very
early
age
and
is
still
continuing
to
develop
now.
I
have
really
enjoyed
the
writing
experiences
I
have
had.
I
am
really
looking
forward
to
being
a
writing
associate
this
semester
and
adding
this
aspect
of
writing
to
my
other
memorable
experiences.
Writing
is
challenging
even
to
those
that
it
comes
naturally
to
because
it
is
a
process
that
continues
to
evolve.
I
am
glad
that
I
can
look
back
at
most
of
my
writing
experiences
as
favorable
ones.
