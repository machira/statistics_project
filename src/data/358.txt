Queen
of
Metaphors
WA
Summer
Assignment
by
I
would
like
to
introduce
you
to
the
"Queen
of
Metaphors."
My
title
reflects
my
passion
for
detailed
expressions,
which
I
have
shared
and
conveyed
for
many
years.
My
descriptive
nature
can
be
attributed
to
an
early
exposure
to
creativity.
At
a
young
age
I
found
myself
describing
artwork
on
my
walls
with
my
mother,
as
we
pretended
to
venture
into
the
scenery
of
the
painting
itself,
allowing
our
imaginations
to
soar.
As
a
child
I
would
never
be
without
a
notepad,
writing
poetry
and
stories.
These
experiences
of
free
expression
had
only
been
nurtured
further
as
I
entered
first
grade
at
my
non-traditional
Quaker
school,
Moorestown
Friends.
A
quote
that
I
so
often
associate
with
Moorestown
Friends
School
is
that
of
Elizabeth
Kubler
Ross,
who
had
so
eloquently
noted
that,
"People
are
like
stained
glass
windows.
They
sparkle
and
shine
when
the
sun
is
out,
but
when
the
darkness
sets
in,
their
true
beauty
is
revealed
only
if
there
is
a
light
from
within."
This
inner
light
connects
one's
soul
to
the
outer
world,
and
it
seems
as
if
the
core
of
my
inner
light
is
illuminated
by
numerous
descriptive
adjectives,
metaphors,
and
similes.
My
earliest
memory
of
a
formative
literary
experience
was
that
of
journal
writing
in
first
grade.
I
can
recall
jotting
down
aspects
of
my
adventures
at
home,
playing
in
the
backyard,
and
trips
to
my
grandparent's
house,
noting
every
and
any
detail
that
came
to
mind.
What
made
this
journal
experience
so
unique
and
fruitful
was
our
instruction
to
sound
spell
words.
Although
some
individuals
may
view
this
learning
technique
as
harmful,
it
was
in
fact
this
strategy
that
allowed
my
descriptive/creative
nature
to
flourish
at
an
early
age.
As
I
wrote
in
my
journal
I
did
not
feel
compelled
to
stop
and
check
my
spelling
which
would
have
interrupted
my
creative
flow.
Instead,
I
found
myself
describing
every
detail
to
the
fullest.
A
sense
of
caution
did
not
exist
in
using
more
complicated
words
or
phrases
due
to
lack
of
knowledge
in
proper
spelling.
In
my
first
and
second
grade
journal
I
discussed
sections
of
books
that
"drew
me
in"
due
to
association
with
characters
"I
could
relate
to."
Therefore,
my
classmates
and
I
found
ourselves
using
much
more
advanced
language
in
both
written
and
spoken
word.
Following
the
learning
strategy
of
encouraging
sound
spelling,
our
teachers
began
to
not
only
comment
on
specifics
in
journal
entry
content,
but
also
made
note
of
words
that
were
improperly
spelled.
The
combination
of
critiques
and
compliments
eliminated
any
sentiments
of
frustration
with
our
errors.
We
had
already
learned
to
express
ourselves
with
certain
words
and
phrases;
therefore
we
saw
the
correction
of
our
spelling
as
a
welcomed
challenge
to
improve
our
writing
skills
even
more.
Various
genres
of
writing
were
included
in
our
lower
school
curriculum.
In
addition
to
traditional
book
reports,
we
focused
on
writing
our
own
poetry,
creative
stories,
and
research
papers,
which
could
have
been
submitted
to
our
lower
school
literary
magazine.
These
writing
exercises
and
genres
continued
to
be
used
as
we
progressed
in
Moorestown
Friends
School.
However,
I
am
a
firm
believer
that
the
journal
was
the
most
productive.
Journal
writing
played
a
significant
role
in
our
middle
school
years
during
our
Intensive
Learning
period.
Another
non-traditional
learning
experience,
Intensive
Learning,
consisted
of
a
week
long
focus
on
a
particular
subject
or
idea
such
as
Quakerism,
Architecture,
Urban
Planning,
Ecology,
etc.
During
this
week,
regular
classes
were
cancelled
and
daily
trips
to
museums,
citywide
urban
planning
meetings,
or
overnights
to
ecological
sites
were
carried
out.
The
focus
of
these
Intensive
Learning
periods
not
only
consisted
of
learning
the
particular
subject
itself,
but
carrying
out
teamwork,
cooperation,
and
most
important
both
personal
and
group
reflections.
Personal
reflections
of
the
day
were
recorded
in
small
blue
journals
which
the
school
had
provided.
I
can
recall
finding
a
quiet
comer
in
a
building
or
sitting
under
a
tree,
and
writing
page
upon
page
about
my
experiences
of
the
day.
As
time
passed,
I
discovered
that
my
journal
entries
progressed
from
listing
actives,
to
more
elaborate
entries
concerning
my
emotions,
internal
goals
and
aspirations.
It
was
through
this
written
expression
that
I
discovered
more
about
myself,
which
was
an
experience
I
will
value
forever.
Writing
was
and
always
will
be
a
passion
of
mine,
and
I
can
attribute
only
part
of
my
ardor
to
the
teachers
at
Moorestown
Friends.
In
addition,
there
were
other
institutions
and
individuals
who
contributed
to
my
growth
as
a
writer.
After
the
completion
of
my
sophomore
school
year
I
found
myself
seeking
more
exposure
to
writing.
It
was
then
that
I
decided
to
attend
Earlham
College
Summer
Writing
Program.
Upon
entering
this
program,
I
was
filled
with
excitement
to
venture
into
a
land
of
freedom
and
independence,
but
also
anxiety
in
entering
a
new
"writing"
world,
that
would
be
different
from
the
writing
environment
that
I
had
grown
accustomed
to
for
10
years.
Everyday
I
found
myself
challenged
in
a
positive
way
to
learn
a
new
genre
or
to
improve
those
that
I
was
familiar
with.
I
wrote
analytical,
creative,
argumentative,
narrative,
poetry,
and
research
pieces.
Not
only
did
I
have
experiences
with
new
genres,
but
also
subject
matter.
During
this
formative
adventure
I
found
myself
experimenting
with
novel
thoughts
and
ideas,
and
challenging
my
mind
to
construct
writing
assignments
with
various
styles
and
formats.
This
program
provided
me
with
a
new
sense
of
self-confidence
in
my
written
work.
Some
individuals
whom
I
have
encountered,
unfortunately
associate
writing
only
with
English
Class.
However,
I
have
had
the
fortunate
experience
of
writing
research
papers
in
Physics,
abstracts
in
Chemistry,
term
papers
in
History
on
the
evolution
of
Jazz,
in
addition
to
analytical
interpretations
in
English
of
such
books
as
Wallace
Stegner's
Crossing
to
Safety.
I
feel
privileged
to
have
never
obtained
a
restrictive
view
on
the
ways
in
which
writing
can
be
used
in
our
life.
Writing
at
Moorestown
Friends
was
not
presented
as
a
solitary
pencil,
but
as
an
array
of
watercolors
with
vibrant
textures
and
hues
which
could
remain
separate
or
blended
together
upon
the
decision
of
one's
paintbrush.
In
addition
to
exposure
to
various
styles
of
writing,
an
essential
component
of
learning
is
the
role
the
teacher
plays.
At
Moorestown
Friends,
the
teacher's
effort
to
effectively
teach
went
beyond
following
their
syllabi.
These
individuals
sought
a
relationship
with
their
students
in
order
to
attain
a
connection
that
would
make
the
learning
environment
nurturing
and
comfortable.
Personal
attention
is
a
weak
phrase
to
describe
what
the
teachers
offered
to
me.
Specifically
in
writing,
I
found
the
comments
on
the
pages
more
satisfying
and
more
significant
than
the
letter
grade.
It
was
from
these
comments
that
I
was
able
to
grow
as
a
writer,
learning
how
to
strengthen
what
seemed
to
be
weak,
and
how
to
improve
and
continue
to
use
what
they
felt
were
successful.
As
well
as
their
written
words
on
paper,
what
shaped
me
into
the
writer
I
am
today
were
the
individual
discussions
regarding
my
work.
These
encounters
were
never
one
sided,
but
instead
an
interchange
of
thoughts.
I
discovered
that
throughout
these
discussions
teachers
were
able
to
help
me
find
more
appropriate
and
fruitful
ways
of
expressing
myself.
Before
I
began
to
work
on
this
assignment
I
decided
to
travel
down
memory
lane,
and
read
over
written
work
spanning
from
first
grade
to
the
present.
I
was
intrigued
to
see
my
progression
and
some
aspects
of
my
style
that
remained
constant.
What
I
found
even
more
interesting
was
the
consistency
of
the
comments
the
teachers
had
written
on
my
work,
such
as
"passionate,
insightful,
and
descriptive."
The
constructive
criticism
that
I
had
received
was
that
of
organization
and
refining
the
amount
of
information,
and
I
was
pleased
to
see
that
I
had
worked
to
improve
in
those
areas
in
this
review
of
my
written
pieces.
These
comments
and
reactions
from
my
teachers
pushed
me
to
challenge
myself,
since
I
enjoyed
creating
a
well-polished
piece.
It
was
not
until
entering
my
College
Writing
course
at
Lafayette
that
I
had
received
the
biggest
written
challenge
of
my
life...
my
style
had
been
questioned.
Initially
I
viewed
this
comment
as
disheartening
since
it
was
my
style
that
had
always
been
praised
in
high
school.
After
accepting
this
criticism,
I
realized
that
it
was
time
to
push
my
writing
to
the
next
level.
I
began
to
examine
both
past
and
present
work
looking
for
the
unnecessary
description
and
detail,
and
overused
metaphors.
I
was
even
presented
with
a
new
challenge
of
having
a
section
of
one
of
my
primary
pieces
of
College
Writing
passed
out
to
the
class
to
"clean-up."
Once
again,
I
initially
looked
at
this
in
an
intimidating
way,
believing
that
my
writing
was
truly
blemished.
However,
I
was
grateful
for
my
professor's
new
constructive
criticism
of
my
writing,
since
the
comments
I
received
both
from
the
professor
and
the
students
were
quite
effective,
and
did
not
significantly
alter
my
personal
style
or
ideas.
Throughout
the
semester
I
sought
out
more
constructive
criticism
with
a
passionate
drive
to
improve
my
writing
even
more.
My
professor
lightheartedly
commented
in
class
that
I
was
the
"Queen
of
Metaphors"
and
explained
how
such
detail
can
be
quite
essential
and
fruitful
to
a
point
(we
exchanged
smiles
at
that
moment).
Even
after
I
realized
that
this
class
had
been
one
of
the
most
challenging
and
yet
rewarding
classes
I
had
ever
participated
in,
I
was
faced
with
another
unique
task.
My
mind
had
frozen
and
my
jaw
had
dropped
when
my
College
Writing
professor
asked
us
to
write
an
assignment
on
our
cultural
determinant,
or
in
other
words
why
we
write
the
way
we
do.
After
many
drafts,
crumpled
papers,
frustrated
walks,
and
long
moments
staring
at
a
blank
screen,
I
came
to
an
epiphany
that
I
will
never
forget.
This
piece
was
quite
difficult
to
write
since
it
could
not
be
fiction,
there
was
no
book
to
consult,
no
topic
to
research,
I
could
only
draw
from
inside.
This
was
a
new
experience
for
me
even
though
much
of
my
writing
was
personal,
but
now
I
was
faced
with
the
question
of
"why".
I
had
learned
that
my
style
was
quite
descriptive
and
detailed
there
was
no
question
there.
After
much
time
pondering
what
I
could
attribute
my
writing
style
to,
I
discovered
that
throughout
my
life
I
have
always
been
explaining
everything
to
the
fullest
detail
in
conversations,
writing,
and
almost
anything.
Growing
up
in
an
upper-middle
class
world
I
have
always
felt
the
need
to
justify
that
I
have
worked
hard
and
have
not
been
fed
with
a
silver
spoon.
I
have
tried
to
avoid
ignorance
and
judgments
and
have
found
myself
explaining
everything
and
anything
to
the
fullest
in
order
to
avoid
any
assumptions
or
invalid
conclusions
that
people
may
draw.
So
in
fear
of
these
unfair
judgments,
or
lack
of
understanding
of
pieces
I
have
written
or
words
I
have
spoken
I
have
provided
every
detail,
leaving
nothing
left
for
the
reader
or
person
to
question
or
discover.
Following
this
epiphany
I
have
struggled
and
triumphed
in
the
quest
to
tame
my
fear
of
judgment
and
allow
some
opinions
to
be
formed
after
conversations,
and
pieces
to
be
left
covered
in
my
writing.
I
look
forward
to
continuing
my
journey
as
a
writer.
I
wish
not
for
a
monotonous
smooth
path,
but
yet
for
one
with
hills
and
bumps
in
the
road,
that
challenge
me
to
grow
and
excel.
There
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
after
I
have
received
my
final
diploma,
that
I
will
continue
to
express
myself
through
written
pieces,
in
my
poetry,
stories,
and
songs.
