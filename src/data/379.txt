Writing
Associate
Assignment
Lafayette
College
18AUG2003
The
Writer
Within
Me
As
a
young
child,
I
would
regularly
lie
in
my
bed
and
listen
to
my
mother
read
me
exciting,
imagination
inspiring
stories.
We
would
regularly
make
visits
to
the
library
and
participate
in
the
reading
programs
they
sponsored.
My
imagination
was
not
only
sparked
by
the
written
word.
I
loved
arts
and
crafts.
I
spent
hours,
days,
even
weeks
painting
colorful
pictures,
attending
art
camps
and
workshops,
and
continuously
stretching
my
imagination
to
its
limit.
Writing
allowed
me
to
share
myself,
my
thoughts
and
my
imagination
like
no
other
way
I
had
ever
experienced.
I
was
able
to
combine
my
love
of
reading
and
art
and
use
it
to
create
a
NnewO
form
of
communication.
A
new
chapter
in
my
life
had
begun.
I
had
become
a
writer.
Since
I
was
little,
I
have
always
been
fond
of
animals.
Behind
my
house
there
is
a
mountainous
forest.
Wildlife
is
abundant.
Deer,
birds,
squirrels,
chipmunks,
and
groundhogs
-
I
believe
we
have
seen
them
all
and
again
many
times.
But
living
in
the
country
was
not
enough
for
my
parents,
particularly
my
mother.
We
often
visited
the
Bronx
Zoo
during
the
summer
where
I
saw
hundreds
of
species.
All
of
these
creatures
fascinated
me
and
inspired
me
to
write.
One
of
my
first
stories,
or
should
I
say,
collection
of
stories,
conveys
this
love
of
animals
and
the
great
outdoors.
Entitled
The
Bird
and
the
Pig
and
Three
More
Storys,
the
book
was
hardly
eligible
to
make
the
New
York
Times
best
sellerOs
list
(or
win
an
award
from
a
spelling
bee,
for
that
matter),
but
it
most
certainly
marked
a
turning
point
in
my
life.
I
still
keep
this
story
in
my
possession
to
this
very
day
as
a
reminder
of
where
I
started
out
so
many
years
ago.
As
my
first
writing
experience,
it
paved
the
way
towards
my
future
writings
inside
and
outside
of
school.
The
story
marked
the
beginning
of
the
long
journey
to
where
I
find
myself
today.
It
is
not
my
intention
to
dwell
on
the
actual
wording
of
my
writings,
but
I
feel
that
since
The
Bird
and
the
Pig
and
Three
More
Storys
was
one
of
my
first
writing
experiences,
it
is
necessary
to
share
at
least
part
of
it.
I
have
kept
sentence
structure
and
spelling
unchanged
from
the
original
stories
(the
writings
below
are
unedited).
These
stories
were
written
more
than
12
years
ago
on
the
26th
of
May
1991.
The
Bird
and
the
Pig
Once
there
was
a
farm
with
a
pig
and
then
a
pig
said
I
see
something
in
the
sky.
It
was
a
bird!
So
the
pig
became
the
birds
friend
The
End
The
Big
Snow
Once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
boy
who
loved
snow.
So
he
wished
for
it
to
come
and
one
day
the
snow
Came
and
the
boy
got
his
wish!
And
it
snowed
for
Days
and
for
years
and
years
and
the
boy
was
very
Happy!
Until
he
became
bored.
So
he
wished
for
it
To
stop
and
it
did
and
so
he
lived
happily
ever
after
The
End
Now
where
oh
where
was
my
Writing
Associate
back
then?
All
kidding
aside,
these
and
my
other
stories
in
this
precious
booklet
reflected
my
own
experiences,
wishes,
desires
and
thoughts.
I
continued
to
write
similar
stories
with
the
encouragement
of
my
mother,
who
always
seemed
to
enjoy
seeing
my
work.
By
the
time
I
was
nine
years
of
age,
my
family
had
recently
acquired
a
computer
with
a
word
processor.
I
quickly
learned
to
use
this
fascinating
piece
of
machinery
as
the
ultimate
tool
for
my
writing.
By
now,
I
had
ventured
into
a
different
form
of
writing,
poetry.
I
am
not
quite
sure
if
my
poetry
matched
any
predefined
types
of
poetry,
but
I
enjoyed
writing
with
rhyming
words
and
sounds.
I
believe
I
was
partially
inspired
by
Shel
SilversteinOs
The
Light
in
the
Attic,
a
book
of
short
and
humorous
poems
I
read
often
during
my
childhood.
In
the
following
short
poems,
written
on
the
16th
of
April
1993,
I,
as
the
writer,
pretend
to
be
the
different
forces
of
nature
giving
advice
to
the
reader.
I
am
the
fog.
I
bring
moist
and
a
yucky
day
My
idea
is
to
spoil
your
driving
I
will
not
spoil
your
day
So
stay
out
of
my
way.
The
above
poem,
along
with
the
others
in
the
series,
further
expresses
my
fascination
of
nature
during
my
childhood.
I
am
certain
that
my
many
undiscovered
childhood
masterpieces
contributed
more
to
my
writing
ability
today
than
anything
else.
These
were
the
years
that
my
imagination
was
able
to
freely
dictate
the
words
that
I
wrote
on
the
paper
without
any
outside
influences.
Writing
Nwithout
rulesO
helped
me
to
develop
a
sense
of
confidence
in
my
work
at
a
very
young
age,
which
has
only
improved
my
writing
ability.
As
I
entered
middle
school,
much
emphasis
was
placed
on
the
analysis
of
famous
poetry,
rather
than
actually
writing
an
original
work.
Perhaps
the
single
exception
was
during
my
eighth
grade
English
course.
The
assignment
was
simple:
write
nine
different
types
of
poems
utilizing
special
writing
techniques,
including
alliteration
and
simile.
My
final
poetry
booklet
contained
poems
ranging
from
a
six-line
limerick
to
a
six-stanza
ballad,
including
a
catchy
refrain.
Because
the
teacher
gave
us
no
requirements
regarding
the
subjects
of
the
nine
poems,
I
was
free
to
be
creative.
The
topics
of
the
poems
I
wrote
ranged
from
weather
to
pets
to
romance
to
Moses
and
the
Ten
Commandments.
My
mother,
my
personal
writing
tutor,
helped
me
with
some
of
the
wording
and
phrasing.
The
nature
of
this
assignment
encouraged
thought
and
imagination
and,
as
such,
I
did
not
place
much
emphasis
on
the
academic
nature
of
it.
Although
I
was
more
than
satisfied
with
my
grade,
the
real
accomplishment
was
the
final
product.
Middle
school
also
marked
a
new
beginning
in
my
writing
career:
research-oriented
papers.
Table
of
contents,
citing
resources,
bibliography
and
double-spacing
were
terms
completely
new
to
me.
I
soon
discovered
that
research
papers
are
wonderful
for
increasing
knowledge,
but
do
little
to
inspire
creativity
or
the
imagination.
Nevertheless,
this
was
school
and
increasing
knowledge
is
one
of
the
primary
goals
of
school,
so
I
had
to
accept
reality
and
start
the
typing.
My
first
experience
with
a
research
paper
was
an
astounding
success.
My
sixth
grade
English
research
paper,
entitled
Genetic
Engineering,
offers
readers
a
broad
overview
of
this
highly
complicated
profession.
Contained
within
the
report
was
a
lengthy
introduction
to
the
nature
of
the
work,
a
completed
sample
resume
detailing
the
academic
requirements
of
the
career,
job
opportunities
within
the
field,
and
expected
earnings
and
benefits.
My
father,
a
biologist
himself,
helped
me
create
the
resume
and
allowed
me
to
interview
him
for
my
research.
The
report
turned
out
to
be
one
of
my
greatest
accomplishments
to
date
due
to
its
sheer
length
and
the
quality
of
its
content.
Apparently,
my
sixth
grade
English
teacher
and
my
middle
schoolOs
principal
thought
so
as
well.
They
were
impressed
with
my
work,
and
I
was
impressed
with
my
grade.
My
first
experience,
and
hardly
my
last,
with
a
research-oriented
paper
was
an
astounding
success
by
any
measure.
Other
middle
school
research
papers
included
a
nine-page
report
on
Rome
D
The
Glory
that
was
Rome,
filled
with
pictures
and
somewhat
detailed
explanations
relating
to
the
government
of
the
empire
and
the
culture
of
the
Romans.
Perhaps
the
only
significant
aspect
of
creating
this
paper
was
that
it
was
my
first
ever
use
of
an
electronic
encyclopedia.
While
writing
The
Glory
that
was
Rome,
I
quickly
discovered
that
an
electronic
encyclopedia
was
one
of
the
greatest
contributions
to
the
world
of
academic
research.
In
eighth
grade
science,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
research
the
great
Greek
inventor
and
mathematician
Archimedes.
This
report
was
unique
in
such
a
way
that
the
assignment
required,
in
addition
to
the
actual
report,
a
project
related
to
the
inventor.
I
created
a
simple
lever,
one
of
the
most
important
inventions
of
Archimedes.
At
the
same
time,
I
discovered
the
benefits
of
such
a
machine
hands
on.
I
also
added
a
few
new
words
to
my
Nscientific
vocabulary,O
including
EUREKA,
the
Greek
term
for
I
have
found
it.
Following
the
discovery
relating
water
displacement
and
density
in
his
bathtub,
the
naked
Archimedes
shouted
this
word
as
he
ran
with
excitement
through
the
streets
of
ancient
Greece.
High
school
opened
the
doors
to
more
exciting
(and
certainly
more
lengthy)
research
and
analytical
reports.
Ninth-grade
biology
required
weekly
laboratory
reports
based
on
the
experiments
performed
in
class.
The
Drosophilia
Cross
was
the
mother
of
all
such
labs.
My
45-page
report
included
extensive
research
on
the
Drosophilia,
the
fruit
fly,
Gregory
Mendel,
the
founder
of
modern
genetics,
and
other
topics
relating
to
genetics
and
the
use
of
the
Drosophilia
in
genetic
research.
The
report
also
included
a
detailed
log
of
daily
events
during
the
three-month
project.
This
paper
was
my
very
first
purely
technical
piece
of
writing,
as
well
as
my
longest.
My
father,
a
biologist,
helped
me
extensively
with
this
report.
My
efforts
paid
off
well;
I
received
a
perfect
score
for
what
amounted
to
nearly
50%
of
my
final
grade.
Although
most
of
my
scientific
writing
occurred
during
the
ninth-grade,
typical
English-related
writing
did
not
truly
materialize
until
my
tenth-grade
year.
My
tenth-grade
English
teacher,
Ms.
Stout,
was
one
of
my
favorite
teachers
in
high
school.
This
teacher
is
a
writing
perfectionist.
Full-length
essays,
typically
analyzing
some
sort
of
literature
or
poetry,
were
assigned,
written
and
graded
on
a
weekly
basis.
Did
you
find
any
problems
with
the
previous
sentence?
For
every
passive
sentence
in
an
essay,
the
Ngrammar
gradeO
dropped
by
a
half.
Grammatical
errors
had
similar
effects.
To
put
it
simply,
the
average
grade
on
such
an
assignment
was
a
D.
Thankfully,
Ms.
Stout
graded
separately
for
creativity
and
content.
Here,
the
average
grade
was,
thankfully,
within
the
A
category.
My
mother
was,
or
at
least
believes,
that
it
was
her
proofreading
that
allowed
me
to
stay
ahead
of
the
average
student.
By
the
middle
of
tenth-grade,
passive
voice
became
extinct
within
my
writing.
My
grammar
and
technique
improved
drastically
and,
for
the
first
time,
I
was
able
to
correct
and
criticize
my
own
academic
writings,
as
well
as
the
writings
of
others.
One
might
say
that
graduating
tenth-grade
English
was
my
first
step
towards
becoming
a
Writing
Associate,
even
though
I
had
obviously
never
considered
such
an
opportunity
at
the
time.
Before
I
knew
it,
my
high
school
career
was
coming
to
a
close.
My
eleventh-grade
English
class
came
and
went
very
quickly.
Writing
assignments
were
easy
for
me
and
I
always
did
well,
especially
after
surviving
Ms.
StoutOs
class
in
tenth-grade.
I
wrote
my
first
major
literary
analysis
paper
in
the
eleventh-grade.
The
fifteen-page
paper
analyzed
works
of
Hemingway,
including
The
Old
Man
and
the
Sea
and
The
Sun
Also
Rises.
The
goal
of
the
assignment
was
to
prepare
the
class
for
twelfth-grade
Advanced
PlacementS
(AP)
English.
The
teacher
guided
us
through
all
major
components
of
the
assignment.
He
assisted
students
with
choosing
an
author,
choosing
the
novels,
filling
out
index
cards
and
collecting
and
managing
sources.
Although
I
was
somewhat
intimidated
with
the
idea
that
I
had
to
write
a
fifteen-page
paper
about
an
author
I
had
previously
known
close
to
nothing
about,
my
teacherOs
guidance
alleviated
my
nervousness
and
allowed
me
to
produce
a
successful,
organized
literary
analysis
of
Hemingway.
I
used
the
majority
of
the
techniques
taught
by
my
eleventh-grade
English
teacher
in
my
AP
English
course.
Outside
of
English,
I
also
produced
a
research
paper
presenting
my
argument
for
the
privatization
of
the
governmentOs
social
security
program.
Unlike
my
English
paper,
I
did
have
background
knowledge
on
this
topic
and
enjoyed
writing
my
opinions
on
the
social
security
Nproblem.O
Within
the
paper,
I
cited
many
sources
that
supported,
as
well
as
opposed,
my
Republican-sided
opinions
of
the
matter.
Although
I
found
it
interesting
to
challenge
those
opinions
that
opposed
my
own,
I
also
learned
much
by
reading
the
views
of
Nthe
other
side.O
My
history
professor,
undoubtedly
a
liberal
minded
man,
also
made
his
views
quite
clear.
Perhaps
the
most
enjoyable
part
of
the
project,
however,
was
the
assignment
to
review
and
critique
a
classmateOs
paper.
As
I
had
known
the
writer
of
the
paper
I
critiqued
for
quite
some
time,
I
chose
to
make
the
best
of
it
without
worrying
too
much
about
offensiveness.
The
following
is
a
small
excerpt
from
my
critique:
Indeed,
Nick
does
have
a
decent
research
paper.
Was
the
class
not
supposed
to
be
proving
a
particular
belief
or
taking
a
side
in
a
controversy
by
creating
a
powerful
thesis
statement
and
using
quotes
and
statistics
to
prove
a
point?
What
I
saw
in
NickOs
paper
was
a
weak
attempt,
possibly
an
accident,
at
what
could
have
been
an
interesting
thesis
statement.
NAlso,
prohibition,
might
have
actually
increased
the
consumption
of
alcohol
in
the
United
StatesO
(Carcone
1).
The
issue
of
whether
or
not
prohibition
actually
helped
Americans
reduce
their
alcohol
consumption
is
a
controversy
among
historians.
Nick,
although
appearing
take
a
side,
does
so
in
apathetic
manner
and
completely
mangles
the
thesis
sentence
(If
one
can
call
that
pitiful
combination
of
words
a
sentence,
that
is).
He
starts
his
thesis
statement
with
the
word
NAlso.O
I
do
not
mind
NalsoO
that
much,
although
I
do
yell
at
several
people
when
they
use
it
every
other
sentence.
By
using
it
to
start
the
most
important
sentence
of
the
paper,
however,
Nick
fails
to
truly
capture
the
readerOs
interest.
When
there
are
so
many
other
words
that
can
spark
interest,
using
NalsoO
is
simply
pathetic
and
shows
lack
of
effort.
An
alternate
thesis
statement
will
be
needed
when
Nick
writes
his
final
paper
next
marking
period.
Try
using
this
as
a
guideline:
During
the
1920Os,
the
controversial
legislation
related
to
Prohibition
not
only
failed
at
reaching
its
intended
goal,
but
actually
increased
the
use
and
sale
of
alcohol
in
this
country
among
people
of
all
ages.
Please
remember
this
is
only
a
guideline,
and
thus
should
not
be
seen
in
NickOs
final
paper.
The
class
received
a
much-needed
comical
relief
when
Nick
read
my
critique
out
loud,
and
I
believe
Nick
received
a
much-needed
NgoodO
grade
on
his
final
paper.
Do
not
worry
too
much
about
my
past
experiences
as
a
writing
critic/reviewer
D
I
would
never
use
such
language
towards
a
Lafayette
writer.
While
on
the
subject
of
Lafayette,
it
might
as
well
be
best
to
conclude
this
documentary
with
my
brief
writing
experiences
at
college.
My
high
school
writing
experience
paid
off
by
the
end
of
senior
year,
and
I
was
able
to
receive
credit
for
freshman
English
110
by
receiving
a
high
grade
on
the
AP
English
exam.
Because
of
this,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
I
am
a
computer
science
major,
I
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
express
myself
in
writing
for
much
of
my
freshman
year.
I
did,
however,
have
the
opportunity
to
write
a
bit
in
my
FYS
Globalization
course
first
semester.
Topics
ranged
from
an
analysis
of
EnronOs
unethical
activity
in
India
to
cultural
imperialism.
Perhaps
the
most
NdifferentO
type
of
paper
I
was
assigned
was
the
comparison
of
different
writing
styles.
Although
this
was
undoubtedly
the
most
boring
assignment
to
write
of
the
three
assigned
papers,
it
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
see
and
read
the
many
ways
a
single
topic
can
be
discussed.
This
is
important
for
me,
as
a
writer,
to
acknowledge,
because
my
audiences
will
always
be
constantly
changing.
My
writing
style
must
adapt
to
my
audience,
as
it
would
be
foolish
to
assume
that
my
audience
would
adapt
to
me.
So
that
just
about
sums
my
life
as
a
writer
thus
far.
I
will
continue
to
hold
on
to
my
early
works
as
a
reminder
of
where
I
started
so
many
years
ago.
My
current
goal
as
a
writer
is,
simply,
improvement
D
continuous
improvement.
I
feel
that
this
Writing
Associate
position
will
only
help
to
improve
my
writing.
Undoubtedly,
I
will
read
studentsO
works
that
will
easily
surpass
my
own
in
terms
of
organization,
clarity,
and
a
host
of
other
characteristics.
I
am
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
my
peers.
Likewise,
I
will
also
be
able
to
help
my
fellow
Lafayette
students
communicate
through
writing
more
effectively
by
teaching
them
the
skills
I
have
picked
up
during
the
past
ten
years
of
my
life.
I
am
proud
that
my
writing
ability
has
given
me
the
privilege
to
take
advantage
of
this
incredible
opportunity
as
a
Writing
Associate.
