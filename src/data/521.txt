This
past
academic
year,
I
found
myself
as
both
a
Writing
Associate
and
a
WA
Mentor.
I
remember
the
day
last
summer
when
I
found
in
my
inbox
the
email
that
asked
me
to
be
a
Mentor;
I
felt
honored
as
well
as
excited
at
the
prospect
of
doing
so.
I
accepted,
of
course,
and
several
weeks
later
found
myself
at
the
front
of
Jaqua
auditorium
along
with
the
other
Mentors
conducting
the
same
workshop
I
had
attended,
incredibly
overwhelmed,
just
the
year
before!
The
workshop
was
just
one
of
my
experiences
as
a
Mentor,
and
just
as
that
was
a
positive
learning
experience,
so
was
the
2005-2006
year
as
a
WA.
The
position
of
Mentor
enhanced
my
experience
as
a
WA
in
many
aspects.
Although
I
had
already
served
as
a
WA
for
two
semesters
prior
to
being
a
Mentor,
there
were
certain
duties
as
a
Mentor
that
required
more
responsibility
and
professionalism
than
I
had
previously
experienced
as
a
WA.
Planning
the
workshop
with
the
other
Mentors
was
my
first
duty
in
this
position,
and
the
collaboration
and
preparation
required
of
this
duty
resulted
in
what
I
remember
as
a
creative,
effective
training
workshop.
I
was
definitely
apprehensive
about
the
position,
and
my
anxiety
was
probably
the
worst
on
workshop
day!
After
the
initial
nervousness,
though,
I
began
to
feel
comfortable
as
a
Mentor,
and
as
this
comfort
began
to
settle
in,
I
think
other
WAs
felt
comfortable
approaching
me
with
their
questions
and
concerns.
The
most
formative
and
rewarding
experiences
for
me
as
a
Mentor
this
past
year
were
the
ones
in
which
fellow
WAs
approached
me,
whether
through
email,
phone,
or
in
person,
with
a
question
or
concern
about
their
own
WA
situations.
Specifically,
one
encounter
in
which
I
was
contacted
at
8:50
at
night
(ten
minutes
before
the
close
of
Drop-In)
by
a
WA
with
a
pressing
concern
about
Drop-In
overflow
due
to
a
professor
requiring
his
students
to
attend
Drop-In
as
a
component
of
a
paper
(!)
was
rewarding
for
me
because
it
showed
me
not
only
that
other
WAs
felt
comfortable
approaching
me
as
a
Mentor,
but
that
I
was
capable
of
handling
their
concerns.
While
these
pressing
matters
were
not
the
norm
for
me
as
a
Mentor,
they
were
certainly
the
most
rewarding.
I
would
say
the
most
typical
experiences
as
a
Mentor
would
be
ones
that
involved
leadership
and
interaction
with
both
other
WAs
and
faculty.
In
interactions
with
other
WAs,
a
typical
experience
would
be
sitting
(sometimes
commiserating)
with
other
WAs
in
the
WA
room
during
conference
weeks
and
sharing
our
experiences,
often
comparing
them
and
offering
advice
to
each
other.
In
this
regard,
my
2005-2006
experience
as
a
Mentor
didnOt
differ
greatly
from
my
experience
as
a
WA;
the
degree
to
which
WAs
came
to
me
for
advice
was
slightly
more
noticeable,
but
in
all
four
of
my
semesters
as
a
WA
I
have
generally
found
the
entire
group
to
be
open,
approachable,
friendly
people.
My
interactions
with
faculty,
as
a
Mentor,
were
actually
quite
shocking
and
differed
greatly
from
my
previous
year
as
a
WA.
I
attended
a
faculty
training
session
luncheon
led
by
Professor
Falbo,
which
was
directed
towards
professors
who
were
new
to
the
FYS
and
VAST
programs
and
couldnOt
believe
my
earsNprofessors
talking
badly
about
their
students!
I
guess
it
shouldnOt
have
come
as
such
a
shockNwe
students,
after
all,
are
just
as
guiltyNbut
the
total
absence
of
professionalism
during
this
meeting
(to
which
I
wore
a
blazer,
expecting
a
total
different
scenario)
came
out
of
left
field
for
me.
To
add
to
this,
I
was
in
a
setting
in
which
I
was
the
authority,
along
with
Professor
Falbo
and
another
Mentor;
the
professors
were
addressing
their
questions
and
concerns
to
us!
This
reversal
of
authority
rendered
the
professors,
some
of
whom
I
had
taken
as
a
student,
as
students
and
myself
as
the
expert!
Bizarre
to
say
the
least.
This
meeting
generally
epitomizes
my
interactions
with
faculty
as
a
MentorNauthority-bending,
causal
discourse.
Shocking
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time!
Moving
away
from
my
Mentoring
experiences,
IOd
like
to
move
to
my
past
year
as
a
WA.
Both
semesters
this
year
I
was
a
WA
to
an
English
professor,
which
was
heaven
for
me!
Of
course
IOm
just
a
biased
English
major
who
has
struggled
through
ES
225
and
with
professors
to
whom
the
WA
program
is
a
bit
more
foreign,
so
having
a
full
academic
year
of
English
papers
was
like
a
dream
to
me!
David
Luis-BrownOs
FYS
was
a
great
experience
for
me
because
I
had
never
WAed
for
freshmen;
what
a
difference
I
noticed
in
a
first
yearOs
writing
from
even
a
second
yearOs.
The
students
were
so
fresh
(no
pun
intended)
and
eager,
and
most
of
them
hadnOt
yet
developed
that
stodgy
academic-sounding
writing
that
puts
most
of
us
to
sleep.
They
were
really
creative
and
open
to
comments,
and
besides
the
couple
wanderers
who
didnOt
show
to
meetings
(which
IOve
had
with
each
semester)
I
had
a
really
eye-opening
semester.
I
learned
that
freshmen
have
a
lot
of
insight
and
that
their
lack
of
college
experience
is
actually
more
conducive
to
creativity
than
being
an
experienced
upper-level
English
student!
Their
command
and
authority
as
writers
was
both
encouraging
and
surprising!
Similarly,
my
experience
with
Ian
SmithOs
Shakespeare
class
was
a
big
surprise
with
respect
to
the
authority
issue.
Again,
I
had
never
been
a
WA
for
upper-level
English
majors,
but
I
went
into
the
assignment
completely
excited
and
ready
to
have
many
heady
discussions.
Wrong.
Aside
from
a
select
few,
the
Shakespeare
students
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
me.
My
comments
were
taken
as
insults
to
their
intelligence,
my
attempts
at
discussion
were
usually
met
with
a
speedy
attempt
to
flee
the
conference,
and
the
first
batch
of
meetings
lasted,
on
average,
four
minutes
or
so.
I
was
shattered.
What
was
I
doing
wrong?
I
brought
up
my
concerns
at
the
next
staff
meeting
and
we
ended
up
talking
about
authority
againNwas
I
assuming
too
much
of
it?
Before
going
into
the
next
round
of
conferences,
I
NloweredO
myself
a
bit
and
began
to
conduct
conferences
with
more
of
a
curiosity
and
(sometimes
feigned)
appreciation
for
what
the
student
was
trying
to
express,
rather
than
focus
on
how
she
was
doing
so
on
paper.
Whether
not
I
agree
with
this
extremely
meek
approach
(I
donOt),
it
saved
me
from
a
slew
of
shattering
experiences,
and
actually
gave
the
students
what
they
were
looking
for:
a
captive
audience.
I
donOt
mean
to
sound
negative;
on
the
contrary,
this
particular
experience
was
a
challenging
and
productive
one
that
ultimately
led
to
a
proposal
for
an
independent
study,
which
led
to
acceptance
into
a
writing
conference.
All
in
all,
though,
I
guess
I
understand
where
these
twelve
moody,
ultra-sensitive
students
were
coming
from:
I
am
one.
I
hate
people
reading
what
I
write,
not
to
mention
if
they
dare
to
comment
upon
it!
Serving
as
a
WA
has
helped
that
issue,
which
I
wrote
about
last
year,
and
I
have
actually
been
spotted
asking
for
input
on
my
writing
once
and
awhile.
For
the
most
part,
though,
maybe
the
main
reason
I
didnOt
mesh
with
the
Shakespeare
students
is
because
weOre
too
similar!
In
my
personal
life
a
writer,
I
donOt
think
I
performed
as
well
junior
year
as
I
have
in
past
years.
Burnout
was
a
major
issue
for
me,
especially
first
semester
when
I
overloaded
on
NWO
courses,
and
being
constantly
bombarded
with
papers,
I
didnOt
enjoy
writing
as
much
as
I
had
when
my
assignments
were
larger
but
more
infrequent.
I
definitely
enjoyed
the
subject
matter
more
this
year
than
ever
before,
and
as
I
move
away
from
required
classes
and
take
what
I
love
instead,
I
perform
much
better
in
the
classroom
discussion
and
have
a
much
higher
interest
and
energy
level
for
learning
the
material.
As
for
the
writing
itself,
though,
I
think
it
suffered.
Meaningless
sentences
and
prepositional
phrases
abounded
this
year.
NFluffO,
as
my
AP
English
teacher
called
it
in
high
school.
The
more
overworked
I
became,
the
less
substance
I
produced
which
resulted
in
lots
and
lots
of
this
NfluffO,
and
I
was
never
quite
satisfied
with
my
papers
this
year
as
a
result.
I
never
seemed
to
have
time
to
substitute
NmeatO
for
NfluffO,
though,
because
I
had
already
moved
on
to
the
next
paper!
I
noticed
this
trend
in
many
of
my
friends
as
well,
and
am
looking
forward
to
this
semester
when
I
conduct
my
independent
study
with
Professor
Seetch
on
junior
year
burnout!
As
for
what
I
learned
about
myself
as
a
writer
this
year,
besides
that
I
was
overextended,
was
actually
a
very
pragmatic
lesson:
always
save
my
work.
In
my
Milton
class
second
semester
I
labored
for
days
straight
on
what
was
probably
my
best-written
paper
of
the
entire
year.
I
didnOt
sleep,
didnOt
eat
much,
just
focused
on
the
paper.
The
night
before
the
paper
was
due
I
went
to
print
it
out
and
it
was
gone.
The
whole
thing.
Not
only
was
I
too
tired
to
begin
again,
but
I
was
so
delirious
from
the
intense
week
of
writing
that
I
hardly
remembered
what
I
had
written
about!
I
was
given
an
extensionEand
then
it
happened
again.
I
shouldOve
learned
my
lesson
the
first
timeNprint
out
my
work!
Save
to
a
disk!
But
I
didnOt,
and
I
had
to
pull
my
act
together
once
I
lost
the
paper
again.
Needless
to
say,
after
that
fiasco
I
was
mentally,
physically
and
emotionally
worn
out
beyond
belief.
What
I
took
away
from
it,
though,
was
a
sense
of
preparedness
and
pacing
myself
that
I
had
never
known
as
a
writer.
I
had
always
bought
into
the
stigma
that
a
writer
needs
pressure
to
perform,
a
writer
needs
to
stay
up
all
night
and
work
uninterrupted
to
produce
her
best
work.
While
I
still
am
the
person
who
performs
better
under
pressure,
I
realize
that
there
are
different
degrees
of
pressureNand
the
kind
of
pressure
that
involves
a
week
of
all-nighters
and
crying
on
my
professorOs
answering
machine
is
NOT
the
kind
IOd
like
to
experience
ever
again!!
I
think
this
lesson
of
preparation
and
caution
is
a
good
one,
especially
as
I
enter
my
senior
year
and
seek
out
jobs
in
the
world
of
publishing
where
deadlinesNand
NO
extensionsNabound.
As
I
do
enter
into
senior
year,
I
do
it
with
much
anticipation
of
whatOs
ahead
for
me
as
both
a
student
and
a
WA.
I
am
thrilled
about
my
class
lineupNChildrenOs
Books,
Emily
Dickinson
and
Sylvia
Plath,
my
independent
study
on
junior
year
burnout,
and
an
acting
and
improvisation
classNand
I
think
itOs
just
enough
of
challenging
and
fun
subject
matter
that
I
wonOt
have
the
burnout
syndrome
that
I
did
last
year.
IOm
also
excited
for
my
year
as
a
WA,
as
I
participate
in
the
pilot
service
learning
program,
which
will
require
3
hours
a
week
of
Drop-In
service
and
two
hours
a
week
of
volunteering
at
Project
with
ESL.
I
think
this
program
will
be
an
interesting
contrast
to
my
past
two
years
of
WA
service,
and
the
community
outreach
aspect
is
really
appealing
to
me,
especially
with
my
interest
in
the
Spanish
language.
I
often
hear
of
the
NLafayette
BubbleO
around
campus,
and
it
really
is
true:
weOre
so
privileged
in
our
resources
on
campus,
and
our
mindset
tends
to
close
if
we
stay
within
this
NbubbleO
for
too
long.
This
summer
I
was
a
full-time
nanny
for
two
children,
and
one
of
them
has
a
learning
disability.
It
was
shocking
to
me
to
see
a
nine
year
old
who
could
barely
read
or
write,
but
I
still
sat
with
her
for
half
an
hour
each
day
and
read
with
her.
We
didnOt
make
much
progress,
but
the
constant
support
and
encouragement
gave
her
a
sense
of
encouragement
that
I
hope
she
brings
with
her
to
fourth
grade
this
year.
I
hope
to
have
the
same
effect
in
my
WA
experiences
this
year,
bringing
confidence
and
results
to
the
ESL
students
as
Project.
IOm
very
lucky
as
a
Lafayette
student,
and
IOm
thrilled
for
the
opportunity
to
spread
some
of
the
good
fortune
around
outside
of
our
NbubbleO.
Finally,
my
advice
to
new
WAs.
Enjoy
your
work.
Even
if
the
subject
matter
is
beyond
your
grasp
(it
often
is),
remember
that
youOre
there
as
an
active
listener,
drawing
the
writers
out
into
a
conversation
about
their
work.
They
are
the
authority
on
their
writing,
not
you;
you
are
still
a
peer.
Get
to
know
other
WAsNthey
are
a
great
resource.
Use
staff
meetings
to
your
benefitNlearn
from
them,
and
use
the
opening
few
minutes
to
share
your
experiences.
Chances
are,
someone
else
can
relate
to
you
or
offer
you
advice.
Enjoy
this
position
and
know
you
made
it
through
a
very
selective
interviewing
process
to
be
where
you
are
now.
Best
of
luck!
