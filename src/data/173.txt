My
History
as
a
Writer
1997-1998
August
1998
I
always
feel
that
my
most
unproductive
WA
conferences
are
with
writers
like
myself.
Writing
has
never
been
a
conscious
or
meticulous
act
for
me.
I
do
not
think
about
writing
as
a
decision
process
like
I
think
about
a
calculus
problem
or
what
to
wear
tomorrow.
Despite
my
years
of
training,
I
do
not
strategize
before
I
sit
down
to
write
a
paper
for
class.
My
prewriting
activities
do
not
include
brainstorming
or
clustering,
but
rather
refolding
all
of
my
socks,
organizing
my
paper
clips,
and
anything
else
that
I
can
possibly
waste
time
doing
around
my
room.
Whereas
my
prewriting
activities
drag
on
as
long
as
possible,
my
postwriting
process
is
allotted
just
enough
time
to
scan
the
piece
or
writing
and
run
the
spelling
check.
After
a
year
of
being
a
WA,
my
writing
process
is
still
rather
delinquent
(notice
the
present
tense
of
the
preceding
paragraph),
but
I
have
realized
how
significantly
my
writing
could
benefit
from
the
textbook
steps
of
prewriting,
writing,
and
postwriting.
This
past
year
I
have
seen
how
other
students'
writing
can
really
blossom
with
the
help
of
the
revision
process,
and
I
have
witnessed
a
student's
face
illuminate
during
a
WA
conference
as
brainstorming
suddenly
unfurls
a
way
that
she
can
relate
to
a
professor's
assignment.
I
also
had
the
rude
awakening
of
a
300
level
English
class
in
which
my
first
draft
of
a
paper
was
not
good
enough
to
get
by,
at
least
not
by
my
standards.
During
my
sophomore
yearf
I
realized
not
only
the
merits
of
the
writing
process
but
also
the
value
of
considering
appropriate
style
of
writing.
When
writing
on
topics
about
which
I
feel
passionately,
the
words
just
seem
to
flow
naturally.
Unfortunately
most
of
my
writing
is
done
for
class
assignments
in
which
I
do
not
necessarily
feel
a
personal
connection
to
the
topic.
The
style
of
these
papers
always
seems
to
vacillate
between
the
two
extremes
of
the
spectrum:
either
very
formal,
forced,
and
unnatural
sounding
or
very
colloquial.
As
I
have
engaged
in
more
and
more
upper
level
writing
courses,
I
am
being
forced
to
control
the
pendulum
of
my
writing
style.
It
has
been
difficult,
but
I
am
trying
to
write
on
even
the
most
incredibly
boring
paper
topics
with
the
grace
which
I
so
naturally
muster
when
writing
about
a
topic
close
to
my
heart.
I
encountered
this
obstacle
in
my
VAST
seminar
course
especially.
The
course
required
a
total
of
five
papers
incorporating
scientific
thinking,
two
of
which
I
was
able
to
write
about
topics
very
near
and
dear
to
me--feminism
and
religion.
My
professor
was
fairly
impressed
with
these
papers
and
expected
my
other
papers
to
meet
if
not
exceed
their
standards.
I
wrote
the
remaining
papers
for
the
class
on
supposed
alien
sightings
and
facilitated
communication,
phenomenon
which
seemed
obviously
bogus
to
me
and
consequently
not
worthy
of
passionate
writing.
Within
each
of
these
papers
the
style
of
writing
was
inconsistent
with
sarcastic
informal
comments
sandwiched
by
stiff
monotonous
introductions
and
conclusions.
My
grades
reflected
the
differences
between
the
papers
I
found
easy
to
write
and
the
papers
which
I
had
to
force
myself
line-by-line
to
write.
I
realized
that
just
because
I
do
not
feel
strongly
about
a
subject
matter
does
not
mean
that
I
cannot
feel
passionately
about
my
writing.
I
reminded
myself
that
poor
writing
cannot
be
blamed
on
a
poor
assignment.
When
following
the
stringent
guidelines
of
an
assignment,
boring
subject
matter
cannot
always
be
helped,
but
how
that
topic
is
presented
can.
An
assignment
might
be
the
invention
of
a
professor,
but
the
paper
in
response
to
that
assignment
is
my
own
for
which
I
must
take
responsibility--even
if
I
do
not
like
the
assignment.
I
encountered
the
issue
of
informal
as
opposed
to
formal
writing
in
not
only
my
VAST
course
this
past
year
but
also
in
my
200-level
literature
survey
courses.
I
took
American
Literature
and
British
Literature
in
the
same
semester,
and
both
courses
required
one
or
two
weekly
journal
entries
on
our
current
readings.
In
the
beginning
of
the
semester
I
treated
all
journal
entries
as
a
chance
to
ramble
on
about
some
of
the
thoughts
that
had
occurred
to
me
while
doing
the
reading.
For
my
American
Literature
professor,
this
was
completely
acceptable.
He
simply
wanted
the
writing
exercise
to
start
us
thinking
about
the
readings
so
that
the
class
discussions
would
be
more
lively.
The
journals
were
not
graded
very
harshly,
and
sometimes
not
even
collected.
On
the
other
hand,
my
British
Literature
professor
was
not
satisfied
with
an
informal
journal
entry.
He
collected
the
entries
religiously
and
expected
the
journal
to
be
a
well
written
essay
in
which
an
argument
was
introduced,
supported,
and
concluded.
After
the
first
few
unsatisfactory
grades
on
my
British
Literature
journals,
I
learned
to
approach
these
journals
differently
than
I
approached
my
informal
American
Literature
journal
entries.
Although
I
enjoyed
and
got
more
out
of
(at
least
as
far
as
reading
comprehension
and
application
were
concerned)
the
more
informal
journal
style,
the
formal
British
Literature
journals
strengthened
my
writing
skills
more.
The
importance
in
considering
my
audience
and
appropriate
style
is
a
lesson
I
revisited
several
times
last
year.
My
class
schedule
was
rather
evenly
divided
between
English
courses
and
Psychology
courses.
The
opinionated
style
which
I
exercised
in
my
English
courses
had
no
place
in
the
scientific
writing
of
some
of
my
Psychology
courses.
Before
last
year,
the
overwhelming
majority
of
my
writing
had
been
done
for
humanities
classes.
My
sophomore
year,
however,
I
had
three
Psychology
courses
which
involved
an
extensive
amount
of
technical
writing.
Although
this
technical
writing
of
the
sciences
was
fairly
new
to
me,
I
applied
some
of
the
basic
principles
of
all
writing,
such
as
clarity
and
coherence.
My
extensive
history
of
writing
for
humanities
courses
without
a
doubt
helped
me
when
I
switched
to
scientific
writing,
but
surprisingly
my
technical
writing
in
turn
strengthened
my
nonscientific
writing.
The
straightforwardness
and
explanation
necessary
in
technical
writing
is
just
as
applicable
to
opinion
essays
or
journal
entries
written
for
a
literature
course.
Just
as
I
had
to
clearly
explain
the
steps
for
a
certain
procedure
that
was
performed
in
the
laboratory,
I
learned
to
precisely
outline
my
reasoning
for
supporting
a
certain
argument
or
making
a
comparison
between
two
characters
in
a
novel.
Although
I
would
not
consider
this
past
year
a
milestone
in
my
history
as
a
writer,
I
do
feel
that
I
have
learned
the
importance
of
thinking
of
writing
as
a
process.
By
process
I
do
not
necessarily
mean
the
textbook
definition
of
the
writing
process
with
its
delineated
stages
of
prewriting,
writing,
and
postwriting.
I
use
the
word
process
in
the
sense
of
an
ongoing
development.
What
I
learn
as
a
writer
I
can
take
to
my
WA
conferences,
and
what
I
learn
from
my
WA
experience
I
can
turn
around
and
reapply
to
my
own
writing.
At
the
same
time
as
I
utilize
my
experience
writing
for
humanities
courses
while
learning
how
to
write
for
a
science
class,
I
can
take
the
clarity
and
explanation
of
technical
writing
back
to
my
literature
journals
and
argumentative
essays.
I
remember
that
someone
once
said
during
one
of
our
WA
staff
meetings
last
year
that
writing
is
a
conversation,
an
ongoing
interaction
between
the
writer
and
the
reader.
I
agree
with
this,
but
I
think
that
transformative
writing
is
also
a
conversation
within
the
writer.
During
this
soliloquy,
the
writer
takes
responsibility
for
her
or
his
writing,
discusses
writing
strategy
(even
if
that
may
be
alphabetizing
her
CD
collection
before
starting
the
paper),
different
styles
of
writing,
audience,
and
assignment,
and
answers
the
question
What
have
I
learned
from
other
writers
or
other
assignments
which
I
can
apply
now?
.
Maybe
those
people
who
talk
to
themselves
while
they
write
are
not
so
crazy
after
all.
