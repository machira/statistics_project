WA
intro
narrative
August
28,
1995
Writing
has
careened
in
and
out
of
my
awareness
at
all
of
the
various
stages
of
life
I've
so
far
encountered.
Sometimes
it
arrives
with
fluttering
birds
and
glowing
motes
of
sunshine,
sometimes
it
comes
in
with
a
the-very-fabric-of-the-universe-is-ripping-apart
sound
accompanying
it.
This
leads
me
to
admit
to
being
hard
pressed
to
find
a
time
when
it
first
became
important,
or
when
it
became
what
it
means
now,
or
what
it
means
now
.
.
.
rhetoric
aside,
I
don't
know
exactly
what
has
gone
on
with
it
or
what
is
going
on
with
it
at
any
given
time.
The
most
I
can
do
is
approximate.
Thus,
I
shall
attempt
to
do
so.
The
most
important
aspect
of
writing,
from
my
perspective,
is
the
word
that
can
optionally
be
placed
in
front
of
it:
creative.
Though
writing
runs
a
wide
gamut
of
styles
and
purposes,
I'm
heavily
biased
toward
the
creative
varieties.
What
has
become
the
importance
of
writing
started
out
as
not
even
being
writing,
just
an
interest
in
creativity
and
storytelling,
and
writing
happened
to
be
the
most
conducive
medium
to
fulfilling
that
interest.
Since
then,
with
the
natural
characteristics
of
imaginative
and
artistic
writing
sometimes
overlapping
with
more
mundane
writing
styles,
I've
found
points
of
common
interest
betwixt
the
many
varieties.
Curiosity
needled
its
way
in
and
led
me
to
explore
those
styles,
as
well,
so
I
discovered
that
they
too
could
be
useful,
if
slightly
more
tedious.
My
first
instance
of
creative
storytelling
was,
as
I
hinted
earlier,
completely
removed
from
the
realm
of
words
on
paper
(this
may
be
breaking
the
boundaries
of
the
assignment
a
little,
so
hold
on
tightly).
I
moved
to
Pennsylvania
in
third
grade,
at
whatever
age
third-graders
are,
and
experienced
the
realities
of
a
rural
neighborhood
as
opposed
to
suburban
one:
children
of
any
age
were
hard
to
find
close
by,
and
the
ones
that
were
fell
a
bit
below
my
expectations.
Hence,
a
loner
was
born.
I
didn't
smoke,
there
were
no
light
poles
to
lean
against,
and
I
was
neither
rebellious
nor
lacking
in
a
cause,
but
I
was
a
loner
nonetheless,
of
my
own
variety.
That
meant
that,
at
whatever
mysterious
third
grade
age
I
was
at,
I
was
forced
to
entertain
myself
with
the
swarms
of
G.I.Joe,
Transformers,
and
Legos
products
that
I
had
managed
to
collect.
Without
an
arch-nemesis
to
control
an
opposing
army,
then,
I
had
to
create
delving
and
intense
plotlines
involving
the
lives,
deaths,
and
thoughts
of
the
toys
to
keep
some
sense
of
value
and
importance
to
their
inanimate
plastic
forms.
But
what
about
writing?
It's
all
integral,
never
fear.
Toys
break,
are
outgrown,
and
most
importantly
have
limits.
They
are
designed
to
look
certain
ways
and
even
do
certain
things.
These
factors
culminated
in
my
leaving
them
behind.
I
tried
drawing,
tried
reading
comic
books
.
.
.
it
should
be
obvious
here
that
no,
I
haven't
devoted
my
entire
life
to
writing
or
known
that
I
wanted
to
do
it
since
the
womb.
It
just
happened
to
coincide
with
what
I
liked,
what
I
was
good
at,
and
what
I
had
the
gumption
to
do.
It
began
by
making
parole
schedules
and
character
backgrounds
for
my
toys,
and
culminated
in
the
creation
of
stories
based
on
characters
I
created
myself.
I
was
just
entering
middleschool
when
the
self-created
stories
began
to
pop
into
existence
.
.
.
before
that,
my
only
remembrance
of
non-fiction
writing
was
in
books
that
I
read,
not
from
things
I
had
written.
I
was
a
miserable
pen-pal;
I
managed
to
disappoint
two
children
from
Austria
and
one
from
Australia,
all
three
in
one
year
(I
regret
that
a
bit,
now).
So,
despite
my
horrible
handwriting
and
distaste
for
having
to
write
for
anyone,
I
managed
to
scribble
enough
stories
down
to
keep
myself
happy.
Then
we
began
creative
writing
in
school
.
.
.
new
horizons?
A
newly
opened
doorway
or
two,
at
least.
My
middleschool
english
teachers
were
the
first
ones
to
truly
boost
my
confidence.
My
sixth
grade
English
teacher,
in
particular,
was
by
good
fortune
my
homeroom
teacher
as
well.
My
mornings
habitually
included
being
in
awe
of
the
speed
with
which
she
deciphered
Crypto-quotes,
followed
by
a
question
or
two
on
the
statement
that
was
revealed
and
the
man
or
woman
who
wrote
it.
I
won't
attempt
to
convince
anyone
that
I
actually
remembered
and
was
influenced
by
those
quotes,
but
they
were
a
good
way
to
arouse
my
curiosity
about
writing.
Seventh
grade
contained
within
its
span
of
days
my
ticket
to
what
seemed
like
stardom,
fame,
and
a
guaranteed
career
as
a
writer;
my
ego
was
given
such
an
inflation
by
the
fact
that,
as
part
of
an
exercise
in
imaginative/descriptive
writing,
my
small
splurge
of
thought
was
read
to
the
entire
class
as
an
outstanding
example.
I
was
labeled
from
then
on
as
that
teacher's
favorite;
it
wasn't
quite
true,
but
what
truth
it
did
have
I
didn't
mind
at
all.
I
was
flattered
and
respected
her
very
much,
and
ended
up
speaking
to
her
more
than
I
had
ever
been
brave
enough
to
speak
to
a
teacher
before.
Eighth
grade,
as
the
sequential
saga
continues,
was
my
first
and
possibly
last
journey
to
the
realm
of
consistent
and
well-received
prose.
I
amazed
my
father
with
a
science
fiction
story
that,
upon
reflection,
lacked
originality;
I
amazed
my
friend
with
a
fantasy
story
full
of
neat
ideas
that,
unfortunately,
lack
depth.
Most
importantly
to
me,
though,
I
amazed
my
english
teacher
with
a
spin-off
on
a
Jack
London
plotline
that
included
enough
drama,
feeling,
and
precision
for
those
factors
to
outweigh
what
it
lacked.
Her
response
to
the
tale,
submitted
as
a
final
project
for
the
class,
was
something
along
the
lines
of
a
request
for
my
first
novel,
whenever
it
should
happen
to
come
out.
That
convinced
me
that
writing
might
actually
be
something
I
was
good
at,
and
was
worth
investing
time
in
(as
opposed
to
everything
else
I
had
tried,
which
mostly
yielded
a
fearfully
low
return).
As
is
usually
the
case
with
middleschool,
after
that
point
I
felt
a
certain
necessity
to
take
things
under
my
own
wing.
I
began
writing
again
without
the
insistence
or
praise
of
teachers,
harking
to
my
younger,
more
carefree
days
(irony
intended).
Upon
entrance
to
ninth
grade,
though,
my
spree
in
self-instruction
was
brought
an
abrupt
and
violent
halt.
The
ninth
grade
honors
English
teacher,
Mr.
Sheaffer,
was
a
legendary
and
feared
creature
whose
origins
were
said
to
be
demonic.
That
entire
year,
which
is
the
hardest
course
I've
ever
taken
(including
college),
consisted
of
me
scrambling
to
keep
up
with
Mr.
Sheaffer's
absurdly
impeccable
standards
for
expository
writing.
My
feeling
for
creative
writing
was
overwhelmed,
and
possibly
drowned.
I
managed
to
resuscitate
it
in
tenth
grade,
however,
with
a
slightly
less
intense
teacher
and
continuing
urgings
from
the
friend
from
middleschool.
Contests
abounded
at
this
point,
National
Scholastics
Writing,
etc.,
and
we
were
encouraged
and
sometimes
forced
to
enter
them
all.
Poems,
stories,
plays,
and
essays
all
went
into
the
entry
packet,
and
the
prize
yield
was
successful
enough
but
not
what
I
had
hoped
for.
Every
year
since
then
has
seen
an
absurd
packet
of
entries
from
me,
two
or
three
in
each
category
of
writing
if
allowed.
This
zealousness
occasionally
caused
me
to
miss
school
to
get
it
all
in
on
time,
and
I'm
sure
hurt
my
ratio
of
wins-to-losses
for
my
entries.
As
should
seem
evident,
though,
that
ratio
was
not
the
main
point
at
the
time;
it
was
simply
to
churn
out
as
much
as
I
possibly
could.
It
wasn't
until
senior
year
that
I
began
to
realize,
after
sending
my
entries
in,
how
embarrassed
I'd
be
at
getting
one
semi-finalist
award
from
among
twelve
to
eighteen
entries.
I
suppose
the
concept
of
public
judgement
hit
me
full
force,
then,
and
I
realized
that
I
was,
in
fact,
writing
for
other
people.
That
hurt,
and
seemed
to
remove
my
innocence
in
a
way;
in
another,
it
probably
made
me
realize
that
I
might
have
to
cater
to
my
teachers'
preferences,
when
it
came
to
writing,
more
than
I'd
have
liked
to.
It
can
be
an
unpleasant
skill,
vaguely
reminiscent
of
the
term
kissing
up,
but
is
eventually
necessary
and
pain-saving.
I,
luckily
for
my
self-esteem,
managed
to
get
quite
a
few
awards
from
my
twelve
to
eighteen
entrees,
including
one
that
made
it
to
nationals,
publication,
and
a
$50
publishing
prize.
That
was
the
real-world
version,
or
so
I
thought
then,
of
having
my
story
read
aloud
to
the
class
.
.
.
I've
come
to
realize
that
the
whole
real-world
thing
is
only
a
myth
right
now,
though
looming
ever
closer
in
the
shadows
and
valleys.
The
one
taste
of
that
world
that
I
did
realize,
though,
as
a
result
of
the
twelfth
grade
contest,
was
that
it
can
be
more
of
a
prize
to
not
get
the
awards
than
it
is
to
receive
them.
A
certain
poem,
for
instance,
The
Ode
to
Peo,
described
in
jaunting
meter
and
poor
half-rhymes
the
fun
and
frolicking
of
the
Smurfs.
It
was
a
hilarious,
enjoyable
poem,
but
structurally
and
technically,
the
entire
class
agreed
that
it
was
crap;
the
poem
was
entered
as
a
joke.
Yet,
it
won
a
gold
key,
the
highest
prize
on
the
regional
level.
At
that
point
I
realized
the
true
meaning
of
subjectivity,
enough
to
feel
proud
at
winning
but
not
broken
up
about
losing,
and
enough
to
want
to
write
for
myself,
again,
more
than
for
contests.
So
that's
the
point
I'm
at
now.
Writing
for
oneself
is
not
such
a
paradisiacal
state,
though,
it's
filled
with
tantrums
and
throes
and
maybe
later,
when
I
have
more
time
attitudes.
I've
been
stymied
by
incidents
like
not
making
it
into
Governor's
School
for
the
Arts,
a
free
Pennsylvania
summer
program
that
provides
and
intense
delving
into
of
a
child's
favored
art
form;
that
set
me
back,
a
bit,
in
terms
of
self-confidence,
and
probably
a
lot
in
terms
of
technical
ability.
College
entrance
essays
weren't
my
high
point,
either,
I
found
it
very
difficult
to
come
out
with
even
one
good
one
(although
I
believe
that
for
Lafayette
I
succeeded
in
writing
well
for
my
target
audience).
And,
of
course,
college
.
.
.
well,
the
atmosphere
was
bad,
but
the
tension,
the
pushing
of
professors
Upton
and
Poggi,
the
distance
from
home
.
.
.
it
led
to
me
being
able
to
write
acceptable
essays
while
in
a
semi-coma
state,
and
pretty
good
ones
when
I
try.
I
don't
like
to
write
essays,
especially,
and
it
requires
a
good
bit
of
inspiration
to
get
started,
but
when
I'm
done
with
them
I
always
feel
very
satisfied
and
content.
As
for
the
beginning
of
it
all,
that
creative
aspect,
it's
still
around
somewhere.
I
think
it
flourished,
actually,
in
my
first
year
at
Lafayette
.
.
.
mostly
because
I
had
angst,
and
angst
is
a
wonderful
inspiration
for
poetry.
Lately
I've
been
more
content,
so
it's
harder
to
need
to
write,
there's
less
I
need
to
force
out.
I
suppose
I'd
have
to
give
credit
for
last
year's
creative
bursts
my
girlfriend
at
the
time
from
home
.
.
.
writing
was
nearly
everything
to
her,
and
her
intensity
and
productivity
were
large
influences
on
me.
I
suppose
I'd
have
to
say
that
she
taught
me
how
to
write
poetry
as
I
know
it,
even
if
indirectly.
She
was
several
hours
away,
very
difficult
to
deal
with
at
times,
I
was
less
than
happy
at
school
for
most
of
the
first
year
.
.
.
between
those
two
influences
and
their
varied
powers,
I
managed
to
find
plenty
to
write
about,
and
plenty
reason
to
do
so.
Then
I
signed
up
for
the
WA
program.
