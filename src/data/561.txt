When
I
first
read
over
the
description
of
the
literacy
narrative
assignment,
I
was
somewhat
overwhelmed,
primarily
due
to
the
fact
that
I
thought
I
had
retained
only
a
few
memories
about
the
beginnings
of
my
history
as
a
writer.
However,
after
consulting
my
parents,
I
began
to
remember
more
and
more
about
my
early
writing
experiences.
I
also
realized
that
many
of
my
writing
assignments
from
middle
school
and
high
school
were
still
saved
on
my
familyOs
computer,
which
would
enable
me
to
monitor
improvements
in
my
writing
over
the
past
eight
years.
After
using
the
assignments
from
my
computer
and
speaking
with
my
parents,
I
compiled
a
representative
sample
of
information
regarding
my
writing
history,
beginning
with
my
first
substantial
writing
assignments
as
a
first
grade
student.
Prior
to
first
grade,
I
had
minimal,
if
any,
experience
writing
compositions
that
were
longer
than
a
few
sentences.
My
first
grade
teacher,
though,
helped
me
develop
my
writing
skills
by
encouraging
me
to
simply
write
about
whatever
I
was
thinking
without
care
for
spelling,
grammar,
punctuation,
or
any
other
details.
She
explained
that
the
focal
point
of
my
writing
assignments
should
be
whether
or
not
a
hypothetical
reader
would
be
able
to
understand
and
follow
what
I
was
attempting
to
convey.
I
learned
to
structure
my
writing
linearly
so
that
it
was
logical
and
relatively
easy
to
comprehend.
These
papers
were
obviously
not
written
very
well,
but
they
were
important
because
they
enabled
me
to
master
the
fundamentals
of
writing
early
on
in
my
academic
career.
By
keeping
the
papers
simple
but
understandable,
I
was
able
to
gradually
improve
the
readability
of
my
writing
in
the
years
following
first
grade
up
until
elementary
school
before
fully
harnessing
the
necessary
formatting
details.
In
elementary
school,
the
style
and
purpose
of
my
writing
assignments
began
to
change.
Instead
of
writing
about
whatever
I
was
thinking,
I
now
had
to
use
my
writing
to
describe
something
else
that
I
was
not
personally
involved
in.
The
initial
transition
into
this
type
of
writing
primarily
consisted
of
book
reviews,
where
I
would
read
a
short
story
or
book
and
write
a
brief,
one
page
summary
report
on
it.
The
reports
would
usually
discuss
the
plot
of
the
book,
but
they
would
not
extend
deeply
past
the
surface
of
the
story.
In
retrospect,
this
writing
was
rather
introductory,
but
it
was
still
important
in
my
development
as
a
writer
because
it
taught
me
how
to
remove
myself
from
the
writing
by
not
using
personal
and
possessive
nouns
and
pronouns
and
by
using
the
passive
voice
instead
of
the
active
voice.
Once
I
reached
middle
school,
I
began
to
write
longer
papers
that
were
graded
more
on
the
basis
of
grammar
than
on
content.
The
aspects
of
grammar
that
my
teachers
focused
on
consisted
of,
but
were
not
limited
to,
subject-verb
agreement,
proper
word
usage
(vocabulary,
redundancy,
etc.),
tense
consistency,
and
plagiarism.
I
typically
did
not
have
problems
with
subject-verb
agreement
and
plagiarism,
but
I
constantly
had
trouble
with
tense
consistency
and
word
usage.
I
always
had
to
read
through
my
papers
multiple
times
to
make
sure
that
all
of
my
verbs
were
in
the
same
tense
and,
since
my
vocabulary
was
not
very
extensive,
I
reused
the
same
words
and
phrases.
My
mother
proofread
many
of
my
papers
during
this
time,
but
she
would
usually
indicate
that
a
specific
sentence
or
paragraph
had
an
error
in
it
and
encourage
me
to
locate
and
fix
the
mistake
myself,
without
her
help.
Before
effectively
grasping
the
concepts
that
she
laid
emphasis
on,
I
continued
to
make
many
grammatical
errors
in
my
papers.
This
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
when
my
writing
style
and
presentation
was
scrutinized
and,
as
expected,
this
was
also
the
first
time
when
I
started
to
dislike
writing
and
reading.
Not
only
was
I
frustrated
by
always
having
my
returned
papers
covered
in
red
ink,
but
I
also
did
not
enjoy
the
books
that
I
was
assigned
to
read.
Regardless
of
whether
or
not
they
actually
were,
when
I
was
a
middle
school
student,
I
found
the
stories
boring
and
difficult
to
understand.
As
a
result,
I
began
to
use
sparknotes
and
cliffnotes
as
supplements
to
the
reading
assignments.
However,
after
a
few
months,
I
began
to
completely
replace
the
books
with
the
supplementary
material.
At
the
time,
this
may
have
made
my
academic
life
easier,
but,
in
retrospect,
this
greatly
hampered
my
writing
development.
Since
most
of
the
papers
I
wrote
in
middle
school
focused
on
the
plot
and
themes
of
the
stories,
areas
that
were
extensively
covered
by
the
supplementary
material,
I
could
easily
gather
enough
information
for
the
assigned
essay
topics.
However,
although
I
maintained
a
respectable
grade
point
average
in
my
English
courses
throughout
middle
school,
using
the
reading
supplements
in
place
of
the
books
hindered
my
writing
ability
and
prevented
me
from
improving.
Consequently,
after
taking
high
school
English
placement
examinations,
I
enrolled
in
the
normal
level
English
course
instead
of
the
honors
course
my
freshman
year.
After
freshman
year,
I
went
on
to
enroll
in
AP
and
Honors
courses
in
every
math
and
science
subject,
but
never
in
any
English
or
writing
based
course.
In
high
school,
I
became
more
aware
of
the
limitations
in
my
writing
caused
by
my
laziness
in
middle
school.
I
had
trouble
transitioning
different
ideas
to
one
another
and
I
realized
that
my
writing
was
choppy
and
difficult
to
follow.
Another
problem
that
I
encountered
can
be
traced
back
to
the
fact
that
I
rarely
read
books
for
class
as
a
middle
school
student
and
I
almost
never
read
anything
other
than
a
sports
magazine
for
leisure.
The
weak
vocabulary
created
by
the
absence
of
reading
caused
my
writing
to
remain
redundant
and
repetitive.
I
grew
frustrated
because,
during
high
school,
I
finally
recognized
that
being
an
efficient
writer
is
a
valuable
and
vital
skill
to
have
in
life,
yet
I
could
not
seem
to
hone
my
writing
skills
and
improve
in
the
subject.
I
feared
that
I
might
fall
behind
with
the
reading
and
writing
coursework
in
college,
but
I
entered
higher
education
with
an
open
and
eager
mind
nonetheless
and
hoped
to
improve
the
weak
point
in
my
academic
abilities.
Upon
arriving
at
Lafayette,
I
frequently
participated
in
my
FYS
class
discussions
and
utilized
the
office
hours
that
my
professor
offered
in
the
hopes
of
improving
my
writing.
I
also
made
it
a
point
to
effectively
study
and
learn
from
the
reading
assignments
in
all
of
my
classes,
not
only
in
my
FYS,
in
the
hopes
of
improving
my
weak
vocabulary.
My
FYS
professor
specialized
in
teaching
students
to
write
clearly
and
concisely
and,
since
one
of
the
main
problems
with
my
writing
was
that
it
was
not
clear
or
concise,
I
felt
like
it
was
a
great
opportunity
for
improvement.
I
initially
found
it
odd
that
the
papers
that
this
professor
assigned
were
shorter
in
length
than
my
high
school
papers,
but
I
quickly
discovered
that
shorter
papers
are
not
necessarily
easier
to
write.
My
professor
required
so
much
detailed
information
to
be
included
in
each
paper
that
I
had
to
carefully
polish
each
sentence
that
I
wrote.
If
I
included
unnecessary,
OfillerO
sentences
in
my
papers
then
I
would
easily
exceed
the
length
requirements.
Eventually,
after
a
full
semester
of
reading
efficiently
and
learning
from
and
practicing
the
concise
writing
technique,
I
began
to
recognize
and
appreciate
improvements
in
my
writing.
I
also
observed
a
steady
increase
in
the
magnitude
of
my
vocabulary
from
gradually
learning
a
few
new
words
from
each
reading
assignment.
I
went
on
to
take
two
more
English
classes
with
the
same
professor
and
I
eventually
decided
to
minor
in
writing.
Although
I
learned
a
great
deal
from
this
professor,
I
knew
that
if
I
kept
taking
writing
classes
that
were
taught
by
the
same
instructor
that
I
would
become
a
creature
of
habit
and
cater
my
writing
style
to
that
professorOs
grading
methods
instead
of
to
my
own
skills
and
techniques.
In
order
to
prevent
this
from
happening,
I
contacted
the
professor
during
the
spring
2007
semester
for
advice
on
selecting
a
course
for
the
fall
semester
that
would
allow
me
continue
improving
and
expanding
my
writing
skills.
The
professor
recommended
a
course
that
focused
on
science-based
writing
with
a
longer,
research
based
final
paper
and
presentation.
This
would
be
a
change
from
the
literary
analysis
and
in-class
discussion
material
primarily
covered
in
my
previous
three
writing
courses,
but
I
felt
that
I
would
still
benefit
from
taking
the
scientific
writing
course
since
I
am
a
civil
engineering
major
and
much
of
my
writing
is
based
on
scientific
research
and
experimentation.
Also,
taking
a
course
based
around
out
of
class
reading
and
in-class
discussion
with
a
large,
end
of
semester
research
report
would
aid
in
diversifying
my
writing
abilities.
Prior
to
enrolling
in
this
class,
I
had
only
written
two
major
research
papers
at
Lafayette,
one
in
my
VAST
course
and
one
in
a
government
and
law
course,
both
of
which
were
based
on
topics
of
my
choice.
I
did
not
submit
a
well-written
paper
for
my
government
and
law
class
and
I
wrote
a
slightly
better
paper
for
my
VAST
class,
but
I
felt
that
I
still
needed
some
improvement
in
my
research
paper
writing
abilities.
Keeping
this
is
mind,
I
kept
up
with
all
assigned
readings
and
assembled
sufficient
reference
and
research
material
in
an
effort
to
enhance
another
aspect
of
my
writing.
I
ultimately
benefited
from
taking
the
scientific
writing
course
not
only
from
gaining
insight
on
writing
from
a
professor
other
than
my
FYS
professor,
but
also
by
specifically
improving
my
research
analysis,
paper
writing,
and
presentation
skills.
After
successfully
making
my
writing
more
concise
and
improving
my
research
writing
abilities,
in
the
spring
2008
semester,
I
enrolled
in
a
journalistic
writing
course
with
another
new
professor.
The
journalism
course
focused
on
presenting
unbiased
recounts
of
different
events.
The
course
taught
me
to
report
factual
events
without
including
my
own
opinions
or
views
in
the
writing.
Although
unbiased
writing
is
typically
associated
with
news
articles,
it
is
still
important
to
practice
when
writing
any
type
of
paper.
Also,
for
the
courseOs
final
paper,
I
had
to
write
an
extensive,
unbiased
profile
of
Lafayette
College.
I
essentially
had
to
describe
what
it
would
be
like
to
attend
Lafayette
to
someone
who
knows
nothing
about
the
school.
The
writing
skills
I
acquired
in
the
journalism
course
helped
me
structure
the
article,
but
I
also
utilized
the
research
abilities
that
I
developed
in
the
scientific
writing
course
to
gather
enough
information
to
complete
the
paper.
Although
I
have
always
saved
the
notes
and
assignments
from
courses
that
I
took
in
high
school
and
college
regardless
of
whether
or
not
I
thought
I
would
need
them,
this
was
one
instance
where
I
realized
how
beneficial
it
is
to
retain
material
from
previous
courses.
Looking
back
on
the
progression
of
my
writing
over
the
past
fifteen
years,
from
my
first
writing
assignments
as
a
first
grade
student
to
the
lengthy
research
papers
that
I
have
grown
accustomed
to
at
Lafayette,
it
is
clear
that
I
have
made
significant
progress
in
my
writing
abilities
.
By
focusing
on
improving
a
few
aspects
of
my
writing
at
a
time,
over
the
past
three
years
at
Lafayette,
I
have
successfully
changed
my
overall
writing
skills
for
the
better.
However,
just
as
any
other
writer
would
say,
I
do
not
expect
to
terminate
my
development
anytime
soon.
There
is
always
something
to
alter
or
improve
in
every
paper
that
I
write
or
read,
and,
at
this
point,
I
anticipate
developing
and
expanding
my
writing
abilities
even
more
in
the
screen
writing
course
that
I
am
enrolled
in
for
the
fall
2008
semester
as
well
as
in
my
work
as
a
writing
associate.
