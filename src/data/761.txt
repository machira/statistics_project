Literacy

August
2012
It
was
my
second
semester
as
a
W.A.
and
I
was
excited
to
be
assigned
to
a
class
that
was
full
of
sophomores.
There
would
be
no
temptation
to
talk
down
to
them
like
there
is
with
freshman
in
a
first
year
seminar.
These
students
are
on
the
same
level
as
I
was,
taking
a
VAST
class
at
the
same
time
I
was.
NThis
will
be
interesting,O
I
thought.
Sure
enough,
these
conferences
turned
out
to
be
some
of
the
best
I
had
as
a
first
year
W.A.
I
had
even
heard
from
a
friend
that
one
of
my
students
told
him
his
conference
with
me
was
the
first
time
a
W.A.
actually
helped
improve
his
paper.
It
felt
good.
Hearing
that
toward
the
end
of
my
first
year
as
a
W.A.
helped
me
to
see
how
far
I
had
come
and
how
much
the
experience
had
taught
me.
My
time
as
a
Writing
Associate
has
made
me
a
better
writer,
communicator,
and
even
a
better
person.
In
sports,
a
lot
of
coaches
say,
Npractice
makes
perfect,O
even
though
in
most
cases
itOs
impossible
to
achieve
complete
perfection.
Practice
certainly
brings
improvement,
but
with
improvement
it
almost
seems
that
more
problems
come
to
the
surface.
This
is
something
that
became
very
clear
during
my
time
as
a
W.A.
I
was
constantly
exposed
to
writing.
Whether
it
was
during
staff
meetings,
conferences,
or
drop-in
hours,
there
was
student
writing
all
around
me.
Reading
all
of
this
and
practicing
constructive
criticism
of
student
writing
had
truly
improved
my
writing
process.
It
fundamentally
changed
the
way
I
look
at
every
sentence
that
I
write.
It
didnOt
change
necessarily
because
I
was
a
better
writer,
but
because
I
was
practicing
more
than
I
ever
had.
All
that
practicing
allowed
me
to
see
more
problems.
In
reading
so
many
student
essays
I
began
to
develop
a
real
set
of
things
I
hated
to
see
in
a
paper.
I
hated
things
like
NfillerO
paragraphs
that
were
only
there
to
reach
the
page
limit.
I
hated
to
read
an
essay
that
wasnOt
structured
well.
I
hated
these
things
but
I
knew
very
well
that
I
had
done
the
same
thing
in
the
past.
So
I
saw
myself
in
great
position
to
help
fix
them,
whether
they
were
my
own
mistakes
or
a
fellow
studentOs
because
I
was
far
from
being
perfect.
After
spending
time
as
a
Writing
Associate,
I
have
developed
new
writing
habits.
Since
the
structure
of
papers
had
been
a
repeated
problem
in
many
of
the
papers
I
read,
I
began
holding
myself
to
the
same
standard
I
would
hold
a
studentOs
paper.
By
the
middle
of
my
second
semester,
I
began
outlining
studentsO
papers
as
I
read
them.
When
I
was
done
outlining,
I
would
ask
the
student
if
that
was
how
they
wanted
the
paper
to
be
structured.
In
most
cases
my
outline
matched
what
the
student
had
in
mind,
but
for
some
students
this
revealed
structural
weakness
in
the
paper.
I
hoped
that
in
every
case,
this
brought
more
attention
to
the
importance
of
the
outline
of
the
paper.
IOve
started
to
do
the
same
thing
to
my
own
papers
and
have
found
that
I
do
not
always
adhere
to
the
outline
I
had
in
mind.
Acknowledging
that
I
am
vulnerable
to
the
same
mistakes
as
my
students
makes
me
a
better
writer
and
a
better
W.A.
I
learned
that
can
be
a
very
powerful
thing.
Recognizing
your
own
mistakes
can
really
help
others
to
recognize
their
own.
During
the
school
year,
one
of
my
friends
asked
me
to
read
his
paper
and
provide
some
feedback.
I
did,
and
while
I
was
reading
his
paper
I
realized
that
he
was
making
the
same
error
I
had
made
just
a
year
before.
He
had
a
well-written
paper
that
had
a
heavily
researched
argument.
Unfortunately,
the
argument
that
he
had
developed
in
the
body
of
his
paper
did
not
match
the
one
he
had
announced
in
his
thesis.
I
learned
a
year
ago
that
this
is
a
great
problem
to
have
because
instead
of
changing
the
whole
paper,
all
that
was
needed
was
to
tweak
the
thesis.
It
was
a
small
change
that
greatly
improved
the
paper.
I
was
in
an
especially
good
position
to
help
him
with
that
problem
because
I
had
been
there
before.
I
asked
him
what
he
thought
his
paper
was
about,
and
then
asked
him
to
read
his
thesis
and
he
realized
that
something
needed
to
change.
I
asked
him
instead
of
telling
him
because
of
my
training
in
the
facilitative
approach.
The
facilitative
approach
is
based
on
the
idea
that
it
is
more
valuable
for
a
student
to
come
to
his
or
her
own
conclusions
on
how
to
improve
a
paper
than
to
be
told
to
change
something.
This
is
something
I
have
started
to
believe
in
over
the
last
year.
I
have
come
to
find
that
this
is
better
for
both
the
student
and
the
W.A.
during
conferences.
As
a
W.A.
I
am
more
comfortable
when
IOm
not
lecturing
a
student.
The
student
has
enough
classes
to
sit
through
without
me
telling
them
what
to
do.
Furthermore,
this
hands-off
approach
allows
a
W.A.
to
build
a
relationship
with
a
student
and
relate
to
them
on
an
even
level.
Ideas
flow
more
freely
and
that
is
the
goal
of
any
W.A.
conference.
A
successful
W.A.
conference
is
one
from
which
a
student
leaves
with
the
desire
to
do
more
with
the
paper
he
or
she
brought
into
the
room.
Sometimes
this
is
difficult
to
accomplish.
I
have
experienced
conferences
in
which
students
give
me
complaints
about
the
professor
or
the
assignment
instead
of
thoughtful
questions
about
the
paper.
This
can
be
an
easy
fix
with
the
facilitative
approach.
By
asking
the
student
a
few
thoughtful
questions
of
your
own
about
the
paper,
a
W.A.
can
engage
the
student
effectively.
Of
course,
this
does
not
work
with
every
student.
Some
students
are
only
there
because
it
is
a
requirement.
I
struggled
to
work
with
these
students.
I
know
I
could
do
better
and
I
hope
to
have
more
success
in
the
future
in
such
situations.
One
thing
that
I
learned
can
greatly
increase
the
value
of
a
W.A.
in
the
eyes
of
the
student
is
a
good
relationship
with
the
partner
professor.
As
I
mentioned
earlier,
it
has
not
been
uncommon
in
my
experience
to
have
students
complain
about
the
vagueness
of
a
professorOs
assignments.
One
of
the
best
things
a
W.A.
can
do
is
speak
to
his
or
her
partner
professor
to
get
an
understanding
of
what
the
professor
will
be
looking
for
and
what
the
students
should
know
for
the
assignment.
This
was
especially
helpful
during
the
spring
semester
of
last
year.
The
professor
I
worked
with
did
not
issue
a
specific
prompt
for
each
essay
but
rather
gave
a
very
brief
description
of
the
two
essays
students
were
to
write
during
the
semester
in
the
syllabus.
The
syllabus
simply
said
the
students
were
to
write
a
case
study
on
a
topic
discussed
in
class.
Most
of
the
students
didnOt
know
what
a
case
study
was
or
how
to
write
one.
In
this
case
I
was
happy
that
I
had
discussed
this
with
the
professor.
It
added
legitimacy
to
everything
that
I
told
the
students.
I
was
able
to
describe
what
a
case
study
was
as
well
as
inform
the
students
that
the
professor
places
a
strong
emphasis
on
using
assigned
readings
in
essays.
This
knowledge
also
gave
me
the
chance
to
offer
something
helpful
to
the
students
who
would
typically
have
no
interest
in
the
things
I
had
to
say.
It
took
me
some
time
to
learn
this,
but
a
good
relationship
with
the
partner
professor
can
be
a
W.A.Os
strongest
asset
during
conferences.
Although
connecting
with
a
partner
professor
can
be
a
huge
help
for
a
Writing
Associate,
it
can
also
be
very
frustrating.
During
the
spring
semester
I
discovered
this
first
hand.
My
partner
professor
offered
me
insight
into
what
he
wanted
out
of
his
students,
and
this
was
very
helpful.
However,
he
had
to
be
coerced
into
revealing
these
things
and
the
few
times
that
I
met
with
him,
I
felt
that
he
was
not
very
respectful
to
the
writing
program
or
me.
It
was
difficult
to
work
with
someone
like
that.
In
the
end,
he
was
able
to
provide
me
with
what
I
needed
to
conduct
conferences
but
offered
me
nothing
more
and
showed
no
interest
in
how
conferences
were
going.
This
was
a
frustrating
experience
for
me
but
it
is
an
example
of
a
way
being
a
Writing
Associate
has
helped
me
to
be
a
better
person.
One
of
the
surprising
aspects
of
being
a
W.A.
is
all
that
I
have
learned
that
isnOt
related
to
writing.
By
encountering
situations
like
this,
I
learned
how
to
respectfully
deal
with
people
who
arenOt
necessarily
helpful
to
my
cause.
In
staff
meetings,
we
are
taught
to
nod
and
agree
with
the
partner
professor
even
when
we
disagree.
There
were
certain
times
when
I
wanted
to
see
if
I
could
change
the
professors
mind
when
he
denied
my
request
for
access
to
the
course
moodle
page,
or
chose
not
to
reply
to
my
emails,
but
instead
I
learned
to
do
best
with
what
I
had.
It
is
difficult
to
deal
with
professors
and
students
in
a
professional
manner
when
they
do
not
respect
your
suggestions,
but
being
a
W.A.
has
given
me
a
lot
of
practice
at
doing
so.
I
think
this
will
be
a
great
advantage
for
me
in
the
professional
world.
One
of
the
first
things
I
learned
as
a
new
Writing
Associate
last
year
is
something
that
I
think
will
have
a
lasting
impact
on
my
life.
From
the
first
day
of
training,
it
is
emphasized
that
before
any
criticism
of
a
paper
is
offered,
it
is
best
to
provide
positive
feedback.
All
W.A.Os
know
to
do
this
during
conferences
because
it
establishes
a
respectful
relationship
with
the
student.
I
have
learned,
however,
that
this
is
also
useful
outside
of
conferences.
Offering
respect
for
other
peopleOs
ideas
and
opinions
is
a
great
way
to
start
a
productive
discussion
of
any
topic.
The
overarching
theme
of
my
first
year
as
a
W.A.
was
the
value
of
respect
for
others.
As
I
mentioned
earlier,
I
was
excited
for
the
new
experience
of
working
with
students
that
were
my
age
last
semester.
I
thought
it
was
a
unique
opportunity
to
feel
comfortable
speaking
to
students
that
were
on
my
level.
As
I
look
back
on
my
first
year,
though,
this
seems
foolish
to
me.
In
reality,
every
conference
is
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
students
on
the
same
level.
It
is
no
wonder
why
this
last
semester
of
conferences
were
my
best.
This
year
I
hope
to
carry
this
attitude
into
every
conference
that
I
have.
I
wanted
to
be
a
Writing
Associate
because
I
liked
writing
and
helping
people
with
writing.
When
I
applied
for
the
position,
I
had
no
idea
how
much
I
would
learn
in
the
process.
My
experiences
have
taught
me
the
value
of
having
respectful
discussion
with
others,
recognizing
my
own
mistakes,
and
taking
the
time
to
read
thoughtfully.
Being
a
W.A.
has
helped
me
to
become
a
better
writer,
communicator,
and
person.
As
I
look
forward
to
this
year,
I
hope
that
I
will
be
able
to
keep
all
of
these
lessons
in
mind,
pass
them
down
to
others,
and
learn
even
more
from
this
great
experience.
