By
Most
of
my
early
writing
comprised
of
sentence
completions.
It
wasnOt
the
GRE
style
of
sentence
completions
where
you
had
to
pick
the
best
word
that
fits,
but
rather
we
were
given
a
word,
and
were
asked
to
use
it
in
a
sentence.
While
this
was
one
of
the
first
forms
of
writing
that
I
undertook,
it
is
something
I
use
even
today.
There
is
no
better
way
to
learn
the
meaning
of
OassiduousO
for
the
GRE,
than
to
recognize
that
your
mother
never
really
appreciated
how
assiduously
you
did
the
chores
around
the
house.
But,
the
more
I
think
about
those
sentence
completions
(and
it
is
only
the
first
time
that
I
am
having
to
look
back
at
my
first
experiences
with
writing),
the
more
I
am
convinced
that
the
idea
back
then
wasnOt
to
learn
how
to
use
the
word,
but
rather
for
us
to
start
thinking.
I
believe
the
first
time
I
started
writing
was
when
I
started
to
let
myself
think.
It
probably
was
before
I
learnt
the
grammar
rules
of
the
two
languages
our
pre-kindergarten
school
required
us
to
learn.
I
believe
the
first
time
I
started
writing
was
when
I
colored
in
a
tree
with
red
instead
of
green.
To
me,
that
was
writing
because
I
started
to
think
of
what
would
a
red
tree
look
like.
Can
a
tree
be
red?
Do
red
trees
exist?
I
like
red,
and
I
like
trees.
I
would
love
red
trees.
Writing
is
essentially
a
means
of
communication,
and
I
was
communicating
that
I
liked
red
trees
better
than
green
ones.
And
then
I
started
talking.
Well,
I
wasnOt
exactly
quiet
and
shy
before
that,
but
by
the
time
I
got
to
second
grade
I
had
started
to
engage
in
public
speaking.
My
specialty
was
extemporaneous
speaking.
I
use
the
term
specialty
rather
loosely.
I
received
early
encouragement
in
the
form
of
public
appreciation
for
being
ObraveO
enough
to
speak
extemporaneously.
Looking
back
I
realize
that
the
more
I
grew
interested
in
speaking
extemporaneously,
the
less
I
appreciated
structured
and
stylized
writing.
Because
in
my
word
of
extemporaneous
speaking,
I
could
talk
about
whatever,
whenever
I
wanted.
I
didnOt
feel
like
I
needed
a
purpose
to
talk;
I
could
just
talk.
At
this
point
an
interlude
is
necessary
because,
well,
because
of
because.
You
see,
my
K-12
English
teachers
would
frown
upon
this.
I
may
have
committed
the
cardinal
sin
of
writing
D
I
started
a
sentence
with
because.
Because
you
donOt
start
a
sentence
with
ObecauseO.
Because
you
just
donOt
do
that.
And
itOs
rude.
Because
it
shows
you
donOt
want
to
take
the
effort
of
saying
the
full
sentence.
Because
it
means
you
are
lazy.
Because
thatOs
what
they
believed.
So,
I
was
talking
about
how
I
had
started
talking.
There
really
was
no
format
to
my
extemporaneous
speeches
D
they
were
just
comprised
of
stuff
I
conjured
up
and
then
said
it.
Looking
back,
I
think
I
was
still
thinking.
But
was
I
thinking
responsibly?
By
the
time
5th
grade
rolled
around,
we
had
started
doing
all
sorts
of
formal
writing.
There
was
a
format
for
formal
letters
to
bosses,
a
different
format
for
formal
letters
of
inquiry.
Formal
letters
to
the
editor
had
to
be
signed
off
on
the
bottom
right
hand
corner
as
opposed
to
the
bottom
left
hand
corner.
But
everything
else
was
signed
off
at
the
bottom
left
hand
corner.
Formal
letters
to
the
principal
must
be
dated
at
the
bottom
as
well.
And
the
coup
de
grce
was
the
rigid
format
of
informal
letters.
I
was
confused.
Why?
Because
isnOt
the
whole
idea
of
an
informal
letter,
that
it
is
supposed
to
be
informal?
And
I
got
reprimanded
for
starting
a
sentence
of
the
conversation
with
because.
Why?
Because
you
just
donOt
do
that.
We
started
having
exams.
There
were
no
longer
just
quizzes,
we
had
legitimate
3
hour
long
exams
for
every
subject.
And
in
English,
we
had
to
write
letters
and
memos.
Now
being
in
the
tide
of
rote
learning
that
I
had
been
trained
to
excel
at,
I
simply
wrote
down
what
the
format
of
a
letter
should
be.
I
received
a
mere
2/10
for
that
question.
It
then
occurred
to
me,
that
the
point
of
the
format
wasnOt
to
have
it
memorize
and
ready
for
reproduction
when
asked,
but
rather
to
understand
how
my
ideas
should
be
presented.
The
purpose
wasnOt
to
preclude
the
use
of
original
thought,
but
rather
to
supplement
it.
In
5th
grade,
we
also
had
to
start
learning
a
3rd
language,
in
addition
to
the
mandatory
English
and
Hindi.
I
decided
to
choose
German.
Writing
in
a
non-native
language
was
challenging.
At
this
point,
a
clarification
is
necessary.
While
English
technically
isnOt
my
native
language,
I
have
been
learning
it
for
as
long
as
long
as
I
can
remember.
The
difference
is,
that
I
can
think
in
English.
With
a
new
language
(German),
I
was
thinking
in
English/Hindi
and
then
translating
it
into
German.
This
made
writing
a
significant
challenge,
because
phrases
wouldnOt
translate
literally
and
the
sense
of
the
languages
was
different.
Puns
in
English
no
longer
made
sense
or
appeared
witty
in
German.
At
the
same
time,
grammar
became
another
beast
that
I
needed
to
deal
with
in
German.
While
I
was
making
my
writing
more
and
more
intricate
and
complex
in
English,
I
had
to
do
the
opposite
in
German.
I
had
to
simplify
my
ideas
and
condense
them
into
simple
words
that
I
had
the
vocabulary
base
for.
It
was
the
first
time
I
truly
appreciated
the
power
of
a
strong
vocabulary
in
communicating
ideas,
expressions
and
thoughts.
During
my
junior
year
of
high
school,
I
started
participating
in
Model
United
Nations
(MUN).
One
of
the
key
requirements
for
an
MUN
was
to
be
able
to
prepare
a
draft
resolution
that
would
inform
other
delegates
of
your
stance
on
the
agenda
items.
Resolutions
had
a
very
rigid
format
even
when
compared
to
the
informal
and
formal
letters.
However,
6
years
of
formal
writing
had
prepared
me
well
for
this.
I
was
now
using
archaic
Shakespearean
phrases
to
make
very
contemporary
arguments.
I
considered
this
one
of
the
most
different
forms
of
writing
I
had
encountered,
primarily
because
now
sentences
could
start
with
because.
Evidently,
the
United
Nations
did
not
hold
itself
to
the
standards
of
writing
set
by
my
English
teachers.
And
then
I
became
an
active
writer.
No,
I
did
not
start
publishing
best
selling
novels
claiming
that
the
bible
was
in
fact
a
work
of
fiction
created
by
some
Pagan
emperor.
Instead,
I
was
being
literal.
I
was
now
writing
in
active
voice.
When
I
got
to
college,
I
realized
that
one
of
the
major
differences
between
the
American
style
of
writing
and
the
Indian
(British)
style
of
writing
was
that
in
India
writers
used
the
passive
voice,
whereas
in
the
United
States,
writers
used
the
active
voice.
Because
the
passive
voice
was
no
longer
used
by
me,
I
started
using
the
active
voice.
And
then
something
magical
happened.
In
one
of
my
earlier
writing
classes,
the
professor
broke
the
age-old
superstition,
that
the
thing
we
believed
in
most
was
a
lie.
He
said
it
was
okay
to
start
a
sentence
with
because.
Because
because
made
an
argument.
Because
there
is
no
code
in
English
against
such
use
of
that
word.
Because
if
it
made
your
writing
better,
why
not?
I
felt
like
the
floodgates
had
been
opened.
Throughout
middle
school
and
high
school
I
had
been
taught
how
to
create
this
wall
between
the
reader
and
the
writer.
The
use
of
formal
sentences,
the
employment
of
the
passive
voice
and
the
complete
and
utter
disdain
for
even
the
slightest
hint
of
colloquialism
resulted
in
this
demarcation
between
the
reader
and
me.
Now,
I
could
speak
to
the
reader.
I
could
tell
the
reader
exactly
what
I
meant.
I
did
not
need
to
hide
behind
my
words.
My
professor
asked
me
to
own
my
writing.
This
is
perhaps
the
most
important
lesson
I
have
learned
in
my
writing
career.
If
I
donOt
feel
comfortable
owning
what
I
wrote,
then
what
was
the
point
of
writing.
Either
that,
or
I
simply
hadnOt
put
in
enough
effort.
Whichever
the
case,
I
felt
my
writing
take
a
big
leap
during
that
semester.
Instead
of
saying
None
would
believeO
and
None
would
thinkO,
I
was
now
writing,
NI
believeO
and
NI
thinkO.
For
the
first
time,
I
felt
like
I
meant
what
I
was
writing.
I
felt
what
I
was
writing.
Eventually,
I
learnt
different
styles
of
writing.
I
learnt
what
it
meant
to
do
economic
writing
and
econometric
writing.
I
learnt
how
to
write
mathematically.
There
was
structure
to
both
these
forms
of
writing,
but
a
very
different
kind
than
the
formal
and
informal
letters.
I
started
keeping
in
mind
the
target
audience,
the
individuals
who
would
be
reading
my
paper.
In
my
odyssey
as
a
writer,
I
have
learnt
to
appreciate
the
power
of
the
written
word
as
a
means
of
communication
and
as
an
organized
guide
to
effective
thinking.
I
am
looking
forward
to
my
experience
as
a
WA
and
how
it
further
helps
me
shape
otherOs
writing
abilities,
and
also
my
own.
