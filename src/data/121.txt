Literacy
Narrative
The
Pen
is
Mightier
than
the
Crayon
I
was
one
of
those
kids
who
could
never
manage
to
color
within
the
lines.
I
tried,
but
my
crayon
always
seemed
to
leave
its
intended
figure.
Thankfully,
I
do
have
other
redeeming
skills,
but
when
our
first
grade
teacher
wanted
us
to
create
our
own
picture
books,
I
was
at
best
befuddled.
None
of
us
had
ever
written
a
story
before,
and
I
knew
drawing
the
accompanying
pictures
would
be
a
true
test.
For
these
pictures,
I
wouldn't
even
have
lines
to
follow.
I
was
on
my
own.
Next
to
the
daunting
artistic
task
before
me,
writing
the
story
seemed
like
a
piece
of
cake.
So,
I
proceeded
to
write
a
story
in
first
grade
fashion
describing
my
family
and
our
house.
I
informed
the
reader
about
how
beautiful
my
mother
was,
my
father's
big
black
beard,
and
my
two
little
brothers.
(I
now
have
three.)
Each
page
was
adorned
with
a
non-descript
stick
figure.
The
children
with
superb
pictures
had
their
stories
displayed
around
the
room.
Needless
to
say,
mine
didn't
quite
make
it.
However,
I
did
receive
praise
for
my
writing,
which
lacked
a
single
misspelled
word.
Clearly,
my
future
was
mapped
out
before
me
from
that
point
forward.
While
some
of
my
classmates
became
artists,
I
pursued
the
art
of
language.
As
is
the
case
for
anyone
developing
a
particular
skill,
I
had
my
share
of
setbacks.
When
we
were
asked
to
begin
writing
in
script,
I
had
major
problems.
Like
my
drawing,
my
penmanship
was
dreadful.
A
sustained
period
of
writing
left
my
hands
covered
with
ink
and
the
paper
full
of
cross-outs
and
smudges.
The
lowest
grades
I
have
ever
received
in
my
life
were
for
handwriting.
I
was
relieved
to
learn
that
handwriting
would
not
be
a
part
of
the
curriculum
for
the
sixth
grade,
as
were
many
of
my
classmates.
Then,
in
what
seemed
like
a
deliberate
attempt
to
burst
our
collective
bubble,
our
English
teacher,
Mrs.
MacBurney,
required
that
all
written
assignments
be
completed
in
script.
I
was
heartbroken.
So,
I
began
turning
in
assignments
and
having
them
immediately
handed
back
to
me
because
they
weren't
neat
enough.
Eventually,
my
cursive
improved
a
little,
but
I
think
it
always
put
a
damper
on
her
perception
of
my
work.
For
all
the
difficulty
I
had
in
that
sixth
grade
class,
I
also
derived
quite
a
bit
of
benefit.
(I
wish
it
always
worked
that
way
in
life.)
Mrs.
MacBurney
frequently
gave
us
creative
writing
assignments.
She
presented
us
with
a
great
variety
of
topics
and
writing
tasks,
ranging
from
essays
to
short
stories
to
poetry.
She
would
never
just
assign
us
to
write
a
poem,
however.
We
were
always
given
something
to
think
about
or
an
interesting
topic
to
consider.
One
of
her
favorite
assignments
(and
one
of
mine)
was
to
give
us
a
list
of
obscure,
unrelated
words
which
we
had
to
include
in
a
story.
It
always
produced
varied,
funny
responses.
I
can
remember
one
story
for
which
we
had
to
use
the
words
navy,
blueberry
pie,
Y.M.C.A.,
front
tooth,
and
moon
crater.
I
wrote
about
an
officer
in
the
navy
who
lost
a
tooth
while
eating
blueberry
pie.
Another
seamen
commented
that
the
hole
left
behind
was
the
size
of
a
moon
crater,
and
he
left
the
navy
in
disgrace.
He
rebuilt
his
life,
becoming
a
muscle-bound
instructor
at
a
local
Y.M.C.A.
As
it
turned
out,
Mrs.
MacBurney
was
my
English
teacher
for
three
years
in
a
row.
I
started
typing
everything,
eliminating
my
handwriting
altogether.
To
this
day,
my
entire
writing
process
takes
place
in
front
of
the
computer.
I
type
as
I
think.
It's
infinitely
easier
to
revise
my
work
on
a
word
processor,
and
things
move
much
quicker.
Just
for
the
record,
my
lack
of
artistic
ability
was
still
apparent
as
I
grew
older.
In
sixth
grade,
I
made
a
lop-sided
clay
pot.
In
seventh
grade,
the
lid
to
my
cookie
jar
exploded
in
the
kiln.
Then,
in
eighth
grade,
the
bear
I
made
in
wood
shop
had
four
very
different
looking
legs
and
the
thread
didn't
quite
hold
up
on
the
football-shaped
pillow
I
sewed.
The
stuffing
was
all
over
my
attic.
Luckily,
I
avoided
art
courses
throughout
high
school
by
playing
in
the
band.
Meanwhile,
my
writing
continued
to
improve.
In
eighth
grade,
our
class
delved
into
the
world
of
poetry
once
again.
We
experimented
with
many
different
forms,
learning
about
rhyme
schemes
and
meter.
The
best
poem
I
wrote
at
that
time
was
a
cute
one
called
Mixed
Vegetables.
It's
not
particularly
profound,
but
its
Dr.
Seuss-style
rhythm
still
brings
a
smile
to
my
face.
Mixed
Vegetables
I'm
not
too
fond
of
vegetables,
Carrots,
broccoli,
or
peas.
I
do
not
want
to
eat
them
With
a
side
of
cottage
cheese.
This
dish
just
doesn't
suit
me,
I
hate
the
special
sauce.
I
advise
that
you
don't
eat
it,
For
it
looks
and
tastes
like
moss.
Brussel
sprouts,
turnips,
beets,
Some
potatoes,
tomatoes,
and
corn.
When
you
eat
this
delicacy,
It
will
surely
make
you
scorn.
Stay
away
from
the
mixed
vegetables,
They
are
not
the
way
to
go.
Try
instead
the
sausage
roll,
Cause
it
s
made
of
meat
and
dough.
My
freshman
year
in
high
school
brought
on
new
challenges.
We
didn't
realize
it
(or
care)
at
the
time,
but
our
school
did
a
great
job
of
preparing
us
for
college.
Class
hadn't
been
in
session
for
more
than
a
week
when
our
geometry
teacher
announced
that
we
were
going
to
write
a
thirteen-page
paper
about
non-Euclidean
geometry.
We
stared
back
at
him
and
at
each
other
in
disbelief.
It
was
our
first
lengthy
research
paper,
and
we
were
in
math
class!
Furthermore,
none
of
us
knew
anything
about
Euclidian
geometry,
let
alone
the
opposing
school
of
thought.
Writing
that
paper
was
a
major
stepping
stone
for
the
thirty
or
so
kids
in
our
accelerated
math
program.
I
needed
more
than
one
library
for
my
research.
(Our
school
library
wasn't
quite
up
to
the
task
of
refuting
the
works
of
Euclid.)
My
father
helped
me
out
quite
a
bit,
pointing
me
in
the
right
direction
and
helping
to
decipher
some
wordy
mathematical
gibberish.
We
found
out
that
non-Euclidian
disciples
were
convinced
that
parallel
lines
must
eventually
meet.
This
became
the
basis
for
a
whole
different
geometry.
In
time,
my
friends
and
I
came
up
with
enough
information
to
make
our
papers
long
enough.
As
a
whole,
however,
it
was
as
if
we
had
never
even
gotten
our
feet
wet
before
and
we'd
been
thrown
in
over
our
heads.
Compared
to
that
first
experience,
subsequent
high
school
writing
assignments
were
much
less
stressful.
Once
I
was
able
to
put
all
the
information
in
front
of
me,
I
never
had
trouble
banging
out
the
text
of
a
paper.
I
wrote
papers
in
high
school
about
Jackie
Robinson,
the
jazz
tradition
of
New
Orleans,
and
the
impact
of
literature
on
American
history.
In
addition,
I
completed
works
of
literary
criticism
for
English
class
studying
the
poetry
of
e.
e.
cummings
and
Edwin
Muir.
My
senior
year,
I
decided
to
drop
A.
P.
Chemistry
in
favor
of
Creative
Writing.
Besides
getting
me
out
of
a
second
year
of
Chemistry,
that
class
afforded
me
the
opportunity
to
write
in
a
variety
of
different
genres,
and
to
consider
topics
I
might
not
have
written
about
in
my
regular
English
classes.
I
wrote
plays,
essays,
opinion
pieces,
short
stories,
and
a
multitude
of
poetry.
For
several
weeks
in
the
Spring,
the
class
lacked
a
formal
structure.
Each
day,
we
brought
in
compact
discs
and
played
music
to
get
the
creative
juices
flowing.
We
all
sat
there
listening
to
the
music,
writing,
and
reading
aloud
what
we
had
written.
I
started
a
very
helpful
habit
in
Creative
Writing
which
I
still
use
today.
Whenever
I
have
an
idea
for
a
poem,
story,
or
even
a
possible
research
question,
I
immediately
write
it
down.
It's
not
always
possible
to
write
when
the
thoughts
come
to
mind.
A
particular
event,
sound,
or
smell
may
inspire
my
writing
at
any
given
moment.
If
I
put
the
fledgling
ideas
on
paper
and
save
them,
the
rest
of
it
will
come
when
I
have
the
time
to
put
my
thoughts
into
words.
Throughout
high
school,
I
received
a
lot
of
positive
feedback
about
my
work.
My
poetry
was
published
in
a
few
school
anthologies,
I
had
work
recommended
for
the
local
and
county
teen
arts
festivals,
and
my
letter
to
the
editor
was
published
in
the
students'
forum
of
the
Star
Ledger.
As
for
my
more
scholarly
pieces,
my
father
(a
high
school
English
teacher)
read
most
of
my
lengthy
papers
in
high
school
before
I
turned
them
in.
He
always
had
insightful
comments,
and
helped
me
develop
the
ability
to
revise
my
own
work.
Now,
he
reads
my
papers
after
I
get
them
back,
and
greets
them
with
nothing
but
smiles.
In
any
case,
when
I
began
writing
at
Lafayette,
I
was
fairly
confident
in
my
abilities.
After
years
of
maturing
as
a
writer,
I
knew
I
would
be
prepared
mentally
for
the
assignments
I
would
receive.
Of
course,
I
was
also
ready
to
continue
improving.
The
biggest
adjustment
was
the
sheer
volume
of
writing
which
I
had
to
produce,
plus
the
more
severe
time
constraints.
In
high
school,
I
had
months
to
complete
lengthy
writing
assignments,
but
college
papers
would
need
to
be
written
in
just
a
few
weeks.
Often
times,
those
few
weeks
can
turn
into
a
few
days.
I
quickly
learned
to
begin
collecting
my
thoughts
early
on
and
to
not
leave
the
writing
for
the
last
second.
In
the
first
semester,
three
of
my
five
classes
had
significant
writing
requirements.
My
first
year
seminar
was
interesting,
and
we
explored
a
number
of
different
writing
forms.
In
that
course,
I
had
my
first
experience
working
with
a
writing
associate,
and
witnessed
first-hand
how
helpful
they
can
be
in
making
a
good
paper
even
better.
I
also
had
to
do
quite
a
bit
of
writing
for
my
history
class.
We
wrote
two
ten-page
papers
during
the
course
of
the
semester.
The
first
one
I
wrote,
a
comparison
of
Martin
Luther
and
Charlemagne,
is
probably
the
best
paper
I've
written
thus
far.
I
made
some
insightful
comments
which
even
our
professor
admitted
he
had
not
considered.
I
also
turned
some
heads
by
selecting
a
topic
which
most
people
shied
away
from.
The
third
of
my
classes
which
necessitated
some
heavy
writing
was
Experimental
Psychology.
I
learned
to
create
in
a
completely
new
writing
genre,
the
scientific
lab
report.
This
is
a
skill
which
I
will
continue
to
refine
throughout
my
four
years
at
Lafayette
as
a
psychology
major.
So
far,
I
can
tell
it
will
be
prudent
to
be
as
descriptive
as
possible
without
being
too
verbose.
It
has
taken
some
discipline
for
me
to
avoid
the
techniques
of
creative
writing
which
I
have
acquired
over
the
years.
For
example,
it
isn't
necessary
to
change
sentence
beginnings
or
use
different
words
to
describe
the
same
object
or
action.
The
more
concise
and
consistent
I
can
be,
the
better.
Without
a
doubt,
I
will
continue
to
progress
as
a
writer
in
the
rest
of
my
time
at
Lafayette.
By
working
as
a
writing
associate,
I
will
receive
exposure
to
other
students'
approaches
to
writing.
Also,
I
will
acquire
more
knowledge
about
the
language.
The
best
way
to
learn
something
inside
and
out
is
by
teaching
it
to
someone
else.
