WA
Literacy
Narrative
August
2012
As
a
Chemical
Engineering
Major,
my
exposure
to
the
creative
and
literary
arts
is
rather
limited.
I
do
have
my
somewhat
out-of-place
Religious
Studies
minor
but
usually
my
day
consists
of
staring
down
equations,
chemical
formulas,
and
energy
diagrams
hoping
that
they
offer
the
answer
I
need.
There
is
very
little
self-expression
in
such
a
field
because
things
are
what
they
are.
There
are
no
creative
interpretations:
if
a
graph
says
NfiveO,
that
means
the
answerOs
five.
As
a
WA
and
a
writer,
however,
a
completely
different
approach
is
required.
Each
person
has
a
unique
writing
style
in
which
NfiveO
may
not
actually
mean
NfiveO,
and
in
most
situations
it
doesnOt.
Symbolism
and
Metaphors
add
a
richness
to
writing
that
seems
to
escape
the
sciences
that
makes
writing
both
more
difficult
and
rewarding.
Over
the
past
year,
through
struggles
and
victories
with
my
mentees,
I
have
learned
a
great
deal
about
the
huge
variation
in
writing
styles
and
how
differently
individuals
can
approach
the
same
question.
Through
this
narrative,
I
hope
to
share
how
my
experiences
as
a
WA
have
shaped
me
as
a
writer,
some
tips
to
a
successful
conference,
and
how
conferences
can
both
frightening
and
calming
for
students
and
how
you
can
help
to
prevent
the
former.
My
first
class
that
I
worked
with
as
a
WA
was
an
English
110
class
that
was
truly
unique.
The
professor
informed
me
from
day
one
that
the
entire
class
was
completely
new
and,
to
put
it
bluntly,
he
was
flying
by
the
seat
of
his
pants.
There
were
no
definitive
assignments
or
timetables,
just
one
project
at
a
time
and
even
those
could
change
if
need
be.
But
I
think
the
most
challenging
aspect
of
working
with
this
class
was
the
incredibly
large
range
of
interpretations
and
directions
the
prompts
could
elicit
from
students.
During
my
first
round
of
conferences,
I
quickly
learned
how
little
nuances
could
make
a
huge
impact
on
the
progression
of
a
paper.
While
it
was
overwhelming
at
first,
trying
to
separate
each
idea
which
was
perfectly
acceptable,
it
soon
became
clear
that
separation
isnOt
always
the
right
answer.
During
a
meeting
for
the
first
paper,
one
of
my
students
was
having
a
particularly
difficult
time
trying
to
figure
out
exactly
what
he
wanted
to
say
and
how
to
say
it.
We
talked
for
about
fifteen
minutes,
bouncing
ideas
back
and
forth,
trying
to
find
that
Ndiamond
in
the
roughO.
Through
the
course
of
this
discussion,
I
remembered
a
conference
I
had
with
a
previous
student
and
it
stuck
with
me.
It
kept
nagging
at
me
that
I
should
divulge
what
I
had
discussed
previously.
But
I
felt
as
if
that
would
be
too
much
of
a
directive
approach,
that
the
student
would
simply
hear
NTake
this
idea
and
run
with
itO
rather
than
NWhat
do
you
think
of
this
idea?O.
Thankfully,
I
was
dead
wrong.
Divulging
those
details
lead
to
a
NEureka!O
moment
for
my
student.
It
was
as
if
he
found
the
missing
link
for
his
thought
process
and
it
was
now
completely
crystal
clear.
He
said
that
looking
at
the
story
in
that
manner
had
never
occurred
to
him
but
after
hearing
it
made
perfect
sense
and
perfected
what
he
was
so
desperately
trying
to
say.
I
realized
that
day
how
important
collaboration
can
be
even
if
it
is
simply
discussing
how
you
view
a
prompt
of
passage
in
a
book.
Since
that
I
conference
I
have
learned
to
take
multiple
views
of
a
prompt,
trying
to
approach
it
from
many
angles.
I
canOt
always
see
the
different
facets,
but
when
I
have
my
epiphany
moments,
the
piece
I
am
writing
always
seems
to
be
so
much
more
vivid
and
colorful.
But
more
importantly,
these
conferences
have
pushed
me
to
talk
more
with
my
classmates
and
professors,
not
only
to
understand
what
the
prompt
is
asking
but
to
understand
the
many
ways
in
which
the
prompt
can
be
answered.
During
my
VaST
class,
I
did
this
for
every
assignment
and
every
time
I
discovered
a
new
way
of
thinking,
one
that
had
escaped
me
because
my
brain
worked
in
a
slightly
different
manner.
DonOt
be
afraid
to
talk,
to
share,
and
to
question
when
writing
because
inevitably
we
always
miss
something
or
blind
ourselves
to
one
or
more
viewpoints.
That
is
the
most
important
less
the
WA
program
taught
me
and
I
use
both
for
every
essay
I
write
and
every
conference
I
have.
This
exchange
of
ideas
is
one
of
my
go-to
methods
for
successful
conferences,
but,
through
trial
and
error,
I
have
learned
a
few
more
that
make
every
minute
work
to
my
advantage,
which
is
extremely
important
when
each
conference
is
only
thirty
minutes
long.
One
of
my
favorite
tricks
I
learned
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
is
reading
through
an
assignment
during
the
conference.
At
first
I
was
very
skeptical
as
I
like
to
know
ahead
of
time
what
the
paper
says
so
I
can
focus
on
problem
areas.
However,
that
meant
the
conference
only
focused
on
what
I
deemed
to
be
problems.
If
the
student
felt
that
his
or
her
paper
was
lacking
somewhere
else,
my
old
method
would
push
those
concerns
to
the
side.
ThatOs
not
to
say
I
wouldnOt
ask
about
them
towards
the
end
but
by
that
time
the
student
may
be
worn
thin
and
not
want
to
talk
anymore.
This
trick,
which
I
learned
during
drop-in
conferences
where
there
is
no
time
to
prep
before-hand,
helped
to
alleviate
the
problem
of
me
controlling
the
conference
too
much.
To
make
it
even
easier,
I
would
offer
to
read
the
paper
so
that
the
student
would
not
feel
bashful
or
embarrassed.
More
often
than
not,
these
were
the
most
rewarding
conferences.
As
I
would
read,
students
would
stop
me
realizing
what
they
wrote
is
not
what
they
meant
or,
if
I
would
stumble,
that
it
wasnOt
very
clear.
Because
this
process
would
happen
in
front
of
them,
they
became
more
engaged,
actively
participating
by
asking
me
questions
and
having
discussions
in
order
to
fix
the
issue.
Additionally,
when
prepping
for
a
conference,
sometimes
the
reasons
for
a
particular
note
or
mark
can
be
forgotten.
If
it
is
read
during
that
conference,
that
canOt
happen.
Overall,
I
noticed
a
much
more
relaxed
and
active
conference
as
compared
to
my
first
few.
Another
tip
I
learned
was
before
reading
ask
the
student
a
few
questions:
What
did
that
prompt
say?
How
did
you
answer
that
question?
What
should
I
understand
after
reading
your
paper?
Before
reading
a
paper
aloud,
I
would
always
ask
a
similar
set
of
questions.
This
allowed
me
to
a)
make
sure
the
student
truly
understood
that
assignment
and
b)
make
sure
I
understood
it
as
well
since,
more
often
than
not,
extra
details
are
given
in
class
to
which
WAOs
arenOt
privy.
If
I
donOt
understand
that
assignment
then
there
is
very
little
I
can
do
to
help
the
student
in
a
useful
and
constructive
manner.
The
first
of
those
questions
confirmed
whether
or
not
a
student
read
the
prompt
or
NguessedO
at
what
it
said.
If
it
was
the
later,
often
requirements
were
left
out
of
papers
which
occasionally
caused
some
major
problems.
Ensuring
that
the
student
not
only
reads
the
prompt
but
understands
it
as
well
is
critical.
The
second
question
allows
the
student
to
reflect
upon
his
or
her
paper
before
beginning
the
conference
while
at
the
same
time
allowing
the
WA
to
understand
the
studentOs
point
of
view
or
thesis.
It
can
also
help
to
ensure
that
sufficient
evidence
or
sources
were
utilized
and
were
applied
properly.
The
third
question
is
one
of,
in
not,
the
most
important
question.
Asking
the
student
what
a
reader
should
learn
after
reviewing
his
or
her
paper
brings
everything
together
and
creates
the
perfect
mindset
to
begin
reading
the
paper.
If
a
student
can
answer
this
question
it
means
they
not
only
understand
the
prompt
but
have
a
very
clear
vision
of
how
they
want
their
paper
to
come
together.
If
they
canOt,
than
some
further
discussion
before
and
while
reading
the
paper
will
be
needed
to
make
sure
that
the
student
adopts
a
thesis
or
vision
for
the
paper
so
that
they
donOt
wander
while
writing
it
and
revising.
However,
just
because
they
can
answer
the
question,
doesnOt
always
mean
the
student
is
golden
but
it
does
make
revisions
and
conversations
much
easier.
As
a
WA,
knowing
exactly
what
a
student
wants
to
say
rather
than
guessing
is
key.
It
allows
us
to
focus
more
and
guarantee
that
the
suggestions
or
discussions
we
have
are
actually
helpful.
This
idea
works
hand-in-hand
with
reading
a
paper
aloud
and
working
through
the
difficulties
together.
Finally,
the
last
tip
I
learned
is
always
try
to
find
a
good
component,
no
matter
how
small,
and
tell
the
student
you
think
they
did
a
nice
job
with
it.
Not
only
does
this
encourage
those
who
may
not
enjoy
write
or
feel
it
is
their
forte,
but
it
offers
an
example
for
them
to
learn
from.
By
pointing
out
things
that
a
student
does
well,
it
causes
that
student
to
want
to
repeat
that
action,
which
can
help
improve
the
paper,
but
more
importantly
the
studentOs
writing
overall.
Say
for
example,
a
mentee
does
a
really
nice
job
describing
something
but
s/he
doesnOt
realize
it
because
s/he
feels
that
her
or
his
writing
is
no
good.
Pointing
out
how
well
that
student
did
may
make
him
or
her
feel
less
self-conscious
and
more
willing
to
work
towards
improvement.
Sometimes
a
little
encouragement
is
all
that
is
takes
to
unlock
a
hidden
talent.
It
wonOt
happen
all
the
time,
but
those
few
moments
were
it
does
are
one
of
the
most
rewarding
experiences
of
this
job.
Those
moments
are
what
make
the
job
so
special;
helping
someone
to
realize
their
full
potential
is
one
of
the
best
feelings
in
the
world.
But
conferences
arenOt
always
fun,
happy,
and
light.
Sometimes
they
can
be
dreadfully
frightening
for
students.
The
dichotomy
seems
almost
unreal
after
hearing
all
of
the
good
that
can
come
of
these
meetings.
But
many
times
the
fear
stems
from
a
deep-seated
hatred
of
getting
papers
back
with
red
marks
scribbled
everywhere.
Very
few
people
take
criticism
with
a
smile
and
even
fewer
people
enjoy
it,
which
is
what
red
pen
screams
when
it
covers
a
paper.
What
usually
occurs
is
that
students,
especially
those
new
to
the
WA
program,
donOt
realize
that
we
have
a
completely
different
MO
from
grade
school
and
high
school
teachers.
First,
we
are
not
teachers;
we
are
simply
students
trying
to
help
our
peers,
which
for
some
can
be
both
comforting
and
disconcerting.
Second,
the
WA
program
operates
under
the
idea
of
the
facilitative
approach,
a
method
in
which
discussions
allow
the
student
to
come
up
with
solutions
and
suggestions
to
problem,
rather
than
the
directive
approach
where
papers
are
marked,
handed
back
to
be
fixed,
and
students
are
told
what
to
fix.
I
have
heard
more
times
than
I
care
to
count
that
part
of
the
reason
students
disliked
English
class
was
because
of
the
prospect
that
they
would
receive
a
paper
back
so
covered
in
red
it
would
look
blood-stained.
Understandably,
that
is
a
huge
turn
off,
to
be
nit-picked
for
every
little
comma
or
period.
Conversely
though,
the
best
way
to
learn
those
rules
and
to
see
less
red
marks
is
through
trial
and
error
but
someone
has
to
point
out
the
mistakes
initially.
However,
what
happens
is
students
become
accustomed
to
this
method,
whether
with
good
or
negative
associations,
and
carry
those
feelings
with
them
to
the
WA
program.
So
before
conferences
even
begin,
before
a
WA
even
introduces
him-
or
herself
to
the
class,
students
have
pre-conceived
notions
about
how
the
whole
experience
will
turn
out.
But
by
the
same
token,
these
conferences
can
be
extremely
calming
if
students
come
in
with
an
open
mind.
As
a
WA,
I
do
my
best
to
stress
that
I
am
there
to
help,
not
to
play
teacher
or
Grammar
Nazi
(unless
it
is
to
the
point
where
those
errors
are
obscuring
their
ideas).
By
the
end
of
almost
every
conference
that
began
with
doubts,
students
are
walking
away
more
confident
because
they
understand
the
prompt
better
or
they
had
an
epiphany
for
their
paper
just
because
we
talked
through
it.
Everything
has
a
light
and
dark
side,
some
less
balanced
than
others,
but
if
you
can
work
through
the
tough
times
the
truly
amazing
ones
more
than
make
up
for
it.
This
job
is
a
truly
rewarding
experience
and
hopefully
these
few
tips
will
help
make
that
experience
even
better.
