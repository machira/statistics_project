I
had
high
hopes
of
becoming
a
Writing
Assistant
when
I
began
my
sophomore
year
at
Lafayette.
I
let
my
WA
and
my
Professor
know
this
from
the
start
and
both
gave
me
the
same
answer:
with
the
condition
my
writing
was
in,
I
was
in
for
an
uphill
battle.
And
so,
knowing
the
challenges
I
was
up
against,
fully
warned
by
my
WA
that
I
would
have
to
Nwork
my
butt
off,O
I
swallowed
my
pride
(in
addition
to
numerous
cups
of
coffee)
and
began
to
change.
NChangeO
required
learning.
Throughout
the
semester,
I
tore
up
my
own
papers,
reconstructing
and
revising
them
until
they
were
fluid
and
connected.
And
eventually,
something
clicked.
The
five-paragraph
method
was
banished
and
the
new,
improved,
college
way
of
writing
filled
with
counter-evidence
and
thesis
evolution
was
instilled
in
my
mind
for
the
many
papers
to
come.
And
so,
this
is
where
my
journey
as
a
writer
takes
hold.
As
a
Writing
Assistant,
I
plan
to
break
the
students
who
still
writes
by
the
five-paragraph
method
of
their
chains
and
expose
them
to
the
reality
of
college
writing.
IOm
a
prime
example
of
how
people
can
grow
as
writers
while
surviving
typical
high
school
writing
techniques.
I
understand
the
fear
of
being
forced
out
of
a
comfort
zone
(believe
me,
my
first
all
nighter
wasnOt
pretty)
but
know
there
is
a
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel.
I
fully
believe
while
working
with
and
learning
from
others
that
these
students
will
be
able
to
strengthen
and
develop
their
capabilities
as
writers.
And
knowing
I
get
to
help
is
the
most
exciting
thing
of
all.
The
excerpt
above
is
from
my
WA
narrative
assignment
from
last
summer.
Looking
at
it
now,
I
find
myself
laughing
at
my
side
note
comments
and
admire
the
intonation
of
my
voice
in
the
piece.
I
feel
the
excerpt
is
cohesive
and
Npaints
a
picture,O
per
say.
I
feel
if
someone
were
to
read
it
that
they
would
feel
they
were
actually
hearing
me
speak.
Aside
from
the
positive
notes,
I
also
feel
that
some
changes
within
the
paragraphs
are
called
for.
For
example,
in
what
ways
am
I
going
to
be
able
to
help
a
student?
Can
I
be
more
specific
on
how
I
plan
to
expose
them
to
the
reality
of
college
writing?
Perhaps
I
could
consider
the
option
of
making
my
conclusion
a
bit
stronger
by
elaborating.
All
of
these
comments
and
ideas
are
things
I
may
have
not
noted
or
considered
a
year
ago.
However,
I
can
say
with
complete
confidence
that
I
attribute
these
thoughts
to
my
time
spent
being
a
part
of
the
College
Writing
Program
and
being
a
WA.
I
still
remember
the
day
I
was
accepted
to
the
College
Writing
Program.
I
received
an
e-mail
a
week
before
classes
started,
assigning
me
to
an
FYS
with
a
professor
who
had
taught
me
in
the
past
but
a
topic
of
which
I
was
clueless.
I
was
terrified.
I
had
no
idea
what
was
expected
of
me
or
whether
or
not
I
was
actually
cut
out
to
be
a
good
WA.
I
also
didnOt
want
to
disappoint
the
partner
professor.
I
found
myself
doubting
my
abilities,
rather
than
finding
confidence
within
them.
Obviously
someone
within
the
program
had
faith
in
me;
the
question
was,
though,
why
didnOt
I?
And
so,
with
my
stomach
in
knots,
I
had
my
first
conference.
I
was
petrified
and
I
felt
like
the
weight
of
the
world
was
on
my
shoulders
to
do
a
good
job.
What
a
Ngood
jobO
consisted
of,
however,
I
had
no
idea.
It
also
didnOt
help
that
I
felt
personally
responsible
if
the
paper
didnOt
receive
a
high
mark,
as
the
student
was
one
of
my
friends.
I
knew
Anna
took
her
work
extremely
seriously,
(as
in
sit
in
on
a
Friday
night
studying
chemistry
equations
for
an
exam
in
a
week
in
a
half),
and
I
didnOt
want
to
let
her
down.
Surprisingly,
the
conference
wasnOt
a
train
wreck.
Though
it
revolved
around
creating
an
outline
from
a
prompt
and
not
necessarily
a
paper
itself,
Anna
still
left
feeling
more
confident
than
when
she
had
arrived.
She
also
had
created
some
new
ideas
that
originated
from
our
discussion.
I
had
helped
her
simply
by
being
there
for
her
to
bounce
ideas
off
of,
to
listen
and
address
her
concerns
with
the
structure
of
the
outline,
and
to
challenge
her
intellectually,
adding
new
insight
and
perhaps
a
new
angle
to
her
paper.
At
the
end
of
the
conference,
Anna
was
smiling
ear
to
ear
and
so
was
I.
I
had
had
a
successful
WA
conference
without
knowing
any
true
protocol,
guidelines,
or
having
any
strict
training.
The
knots
in
my
stomach
were
finally
gone
and
I
had
regained
some
of
the
confidence
I
had
once
lost.
I
was
ready
to
take
on
conferences
with
students
I
didnOt
know
and
was
comfortable
addressing
topics
I
wasnOt
knowledgeable
in.
I
had
proven
to
myself
that
I
could
actually
be
a
WA.
Not
all
conferences
run
smoothly,
though.
I
believe
I
lucked
out
with
my
first
conference
being
my
friend.
True,
I
felt
an
extraordinary
amount
of
pressure
to
have
a
good
conference,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
Anna
was
still
my
friend.
Even
if
she
were
upset
with
our
meeting,
Anna
most
likely
wouldnOt
have
told
me.
She
was
engaged
in
the
conference
and
truly
wanted
something
out
of
it.
Not
all
students
care
as
much
as
Anna
did
and
that
was
something
that
took
me
a
while
to
learn.
Also,
not
all
students
took
the
time
to
prepare
for
a
discussion
of
their
assigned
topic
nor
did
they
always
put
in
the
same
amount
of
effort
that
I
as
a
WA
put
in
to
try
and
help
them
succeed.
ThatOs
just
a
fact
of
life.
Once
I
accepted
this
(though
it
took
some
time)
I
found
the
majority
of
the
pressure
I
previoulsy
felt
disappear.
I
realized
the
pressure
was
coming
from
myself;
I
was
my
own
worst
enemy.
I
realized
I
couldnOt
take
personal
responsibility
for
someone
elseOs
work.
I
could
only
strive
to
help
students
with
concepts
such
as
structure,
cohesiveness,
and
details;
I
couldnOt
judge
what
was
right
or
wrong
in
their
papers.
Simply
put,
that
wasnOt
part
of
my
job.
I
could,
however,
eliminate
the
feeling
that
I
was
responsible
for
a
particular
studentOs
success
and
instead
focus
on
being
the
best
WA
I
could
be
to
help
motivate
students
to
want
to
succeed
on
their
own.
Regaining
my
confidence
and
becoming
comfortable
with
the
responsibilities
of
my
position
allowed
me
to
embrace
the
many
benefits
of
being
a
WA.
Conferences
allow
me
to
meet
a
multitude
of
people
that
I
may
never
have
spoken
to
if
I
wasnOt
their
WA.
Being
such
a
small
school,
one
may
assume
that
everyone
on
the
Lafayette
College
campus
knows
one
another
but
that
simply
isnOt
the
truth.
If
I
hadnOt
been
a
WA,
the
chance
of
me
personally
becoming
friends
with
an
engineering
major
born
in
Kenya
would
be
slim
as
IOm
studying
biology,
live
in
a
suburb
outside
New
York
City,
and
have
never
been
to
Africa.
The
opportunity
to
meet
people
when
youOre
a
WA
is
endless.
I
find
that
another
important
benefit
of
being
a
WA
is
being
able
to
help
others.
I
came
into
Lafayette
feeling
like
my
writing
skills
were
superb
and
that
I
was
right
where
I
needed
to
be.
I
was
the
one
in
high
school
editing
my
friendsO
papers
and
so
I
thought
I
had
something
special
walking
into
college.
I
was
wrong.
It
took
a
lot
of
effort
to
break
out
of
the
conventional
high-school
writing
standard
of
the
five-paragraph
method
and
to
understand
the
true
meaning
of
concepts
such
as
Nthesis
evolution.O
Though
IOm
confident
in
my
skill
set
now,
it
took
two
years
of
hard
work
and
effort
to
break
the
writing
habits
I
had
been
taught
in
high
school.
Experiencing
the
struggle
first-handedly
made
me
want
to
be
a
WA.
I
know
that
many
people
struggle
with
writing
just
as
I
did
in
the
past
and
I
enjoy
the
fact
that
I
can
hold
a
conference
with
a
student
who
is
terrified
of
a
prompt
and
know
that
by
working
with
them,
they
are
able
to
leave
having
made
progress
in
the
assignment
in
addition
to
being
confident
in
their
writing.
I
also
enjoy
the
fact
that
I
can
make
a
student
think
outside
the
box
by
asking
them
indirect
questions
about
their
writing
or
by
simply
asking
them
to
elaborate
on
an
idea
I
find
interesting
within
their
paper.
By
probing
them,
the
students
are
able
to
come
up
with
their
own
ideas
instead
of
me
simply
suggesting
ones
to
them.
I
like
to
think
of
these
Naha!O
moments
during
conferences
as
some
of
the
most
rewarding
experiences
that
happen
when
being
a
WA.
They
reassure
me
that
IOm
doing
my
job
well.
As
much
as
I
love
to
help
others,
it
would
be
silly
not
to
discuss
the
how
the
writing
program
has
helped
me.
IOm
able
to
learn
about
subjects
that
I
otherwise
wouldnOt
be
able
to
encounter
given
my
major.
For
example,
the
FYS
class
I
NWA-edO
revolved
around
environmental
sustainability
within
the
subject
boundaries
of
engineering
and
technology.
Though
I
wasnOt
the
biggest
fan
of
the
technical
aspects
of
the
topic,
I
was
able
to
absorb
a
large
amount
of
information
regarding
mankind
and
its
impact
on
the
environment.
Were
you
aware
that
even
if
an
object
is
plugged
into
an
outlet
and
is
turned
off
that
it
still
consumes
energy?
I
wasnOt.
That
tidbit
(along
with
others)
is
a
fact
that
I
simply
wouldnOt
know
without
reading
studentsO
papers
from
that
particular
class.
Something
simple
like
learning
a
new
fact
truly
makes
me
appreciate
my
time
spent
as
a
WA.
Being
a
WA
has
also
personally
helped
me
with
my
writing.
The
constant
reading
of
papers
and
discussion
with
students
has
led
me
to
create
a
whole
new
approach
to
writing.
I
find
myself
using
tactics
that
I
use
in
conferences
on
my
own
assignments.
For
example,
during
a
conference
with
a
student
who
is
struggling
with
a
prompt,
I
like
to
first
have
the
student
explain
what
they
feel
the
assignment
asks
them
to
do.
I
then
follow
with
brainstorming
and
then
finally
have
the
student
organize
his
ideas,
therefore
creating
a
structure
for
which
he
can
use
to
write
his
paper.
I
would
like
to
think
I
have
a
high
success
rate,
as
most
students
tend
to
leave
the
conferences
feeling
much
more
secure
with
their
assignments.
I
find
itOs
easier
for
me
to
write
my
paper
when
I
follow
the
same
protocol
that
I
use
with
students.
After
all,
why
recommend
a
particular
way
of
doing
something
if
in
the
end,
that
way
doesnOt
work?
All
of
the
experiences
one
has
when
they
are
a
WA
arenOt
necessarily
positive,
though.
Problems
other
than
those
associated
with
conferences
also
exist.
For
example,
I
ran
into
a
huge
problem
my
second
semester
being
a
WA.
My
partner
professor
didnOt
penalize
students
for
missing
conferences
and
as
a
result,
the
students
didnOt
take
the
conferences
or
me
seriously.
As
a
result,
I
spent
countless
hours
in
the
Skillman
caf
wasting
my
money
on
chai
lattes
to
keep
me
awake
in
addition
to
wasting
my
time.
These
experiences
are
inevitable.
Perhaps
it
wonOt
be
a
partner
professor
that
a
WA
has
a
problem
with;
maybe
itOs
one
particular
student
who
refuses
to
engage
in
a
conference
or
a
different
student
who
text
messages
you
five
minutes
before
theyOre
supposed
to
show
for
a
conference
only
to
cancel.
These
are
learning
experiences
and
a
WA
must,
though
itOs
hard,
remain
positive.
Sometimes
the
problems
will
work
out
without
any
additional
help
and
sometimes
they
wonOt.
The
most
important
thing
I
learned,
though,
is
that
there
isnOt
any
harm
in
asking
for
help.
If
I
were
to
offer
any
advice
to
the
new
WAs,
it
would
be
to
enjoy
yourselves.
Though
at
times
it
can
be
strenuous,
(no
doubt,
conferences
will
always
fall
on
the
weeks
where
you
have
three
exams
and
a
project
due),
it
really
is
rewarding
to
be
able
to
know
you
had
an
impact
on
someone.
Take
advantage
of
the
information
you
obtain
and
the
opportunities
you
have
to
meet
people.
And
most
of
all,
be
confident.
Someone
in
the
College
Writing
Program
had
faith
in
you.
You
should,
too.
