Thinking
back
on
my
first
attempts
as
a
writer
in
elementary
school,
I
can't
help
but
remember
how
much
I
hated
writing
on
that
pasty,
yellow
paper
with
ruled
lines
that
were
probably
about
three
inches
wide.
Just
erasing
on
that
paper
used
to
drive
me
crazy.
We
were
always
given
pencils
who's
erasers
had
been
worn
down,
and
all
they
accomplished
doing
was
to
scratch
the
paper
and
leave
yellow
fibers
all
over
the
tip
of
your
pencil.
I
remember
practicing
my
"cursive",
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
over
and
over
on
that
same
paper,
hoping
that
I
would
soon
graduate
onto
that
white
paper
reserved
for
those
who
had
mastered
the
alphabet
and
actually
moved
on
to
writing
something
constructive.
The
first
memory
I
have
of
an
actual
writing
assignment
was
in
second
grade,
when
we
were
told
to
write
a
short
story
about
our
summer
vacations.
The
exciting
thing
about
it
was
that
we
got
to
cut
out
a
pair
of
construction
paper
sunglasses
and
illustrate
scenes
from
our
vacation
along
with
the
story,
which
I
guess
was
a
pretty
clever
move
on
the
part
of
our
teacher
because
I
remember
thinking
that
it
was
not
such
a
bad
assignment
after
all.
I
was
always
grateful
anyway
because
I
never
had
to
use
one
of
those
neon
angular
grips
on
my
pencil.
The
only
purpose
they
served,
as
far
as
second
graders
were
concerned
anyway,
was
to
point
out
exactly
who
was
having
trouble
with
their
writing,
which
was
of
course
something
you
always
wanted
to
avoid.
Between
the
first
stages
of
learning
how
to
write,
and
that
Junior
High
period
during
which
I
felt
like
all
that
I
ever
did
was
write
book
reports,
I
don't
really
recall
having
an
overload
of
writing
assignments.
The
teachers
always
tried
to
make
the
writing
process
a
little
more
creative
by
disguising
our
so
called
writing
assignments
as
book
covers,
poster
narratives,
etc.
I
never
really
minded
writing
book
reports
because
there
was
always
something
else
that
went
along
with
them,
like
a
diorama,
a
poster,
a
mobile,
etc.
Anything
that
allowed
me
to
do
something
artistic
along
with
the
writing
always
took
the
sting
out
of
the
whole
assignment.
I
enjoyed
doing
those
reports
sometimes.
I
liked
how
they
were
so
structured
and
outlined,
just
list
the
characters
and
write
something
descriptive
and
brief
about
each,
that
wasn't
so
bad.
It
didn't
really
resemble
a
paper
that
way
anyway,
When
Junior
High
finally
came
to
a
close
and
I
entered
High
School,
the
writing
assignments
seemed
to
lose
their
creative
edge,
and
the
study
of
grammar
and
the
proper
ways
to
compose
letters,
reports,
journals,
etc.
replaced
everything
about
writing
that
I
had
ever
considered
fun.
My
freshman
year
in
high
school
I
had
Mrs.
Knight
for
English.
No
one
liked
Mrs.
Knight
because
she
made
you
keep
a
journal
for
the
entire
year
where
you
had
to
write
down
your
feelings
about
the
assignments,
how
you
thought
you
were
progressing,
what
you
thought
of
the
class,
etc.
Basically,
to
us,
all
it
was
was
a
huge
addition
to
all
of
the
other
writing
assignments
that
we
dreaded
doing
anyway.
It
was
my
first
attempt
at
a
journal,
and
I
must
say
that
it
was
a
very
weak
one
at
that.
I
hated
trying
to
come
up
with
something
thoughtful
and
insightful
about
English
class
everyday.
So
far
my
experiences
with
writing
hadn't
proved
to
be
too
successful.
My
sophomore
year,
I
decided
to
interview
for
a
position
on
the
school
newspaper
staff.
I
think
it
was
the
idea
of
writing
something
that
the
entire
school
and
town
would
be
exposed
to
that
really
got
me
interested.
It
was
a
welcome
change
from
the
average
writing
assignments
that
you
did
in
school
and
it
also
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
write
about
anything
that
I
wanted.
I
interviewed
for
the
position
and
was
awarded
the
position
as
Feature
Editor,
as
well
as
being
a
staff
reporter.
As
Feature
Editor,
I
was
responsible
for
creative
additions
to
the
paper,
as
opposed
to
reporting
on
current
issues,
sports,
and
school
issues.
It
was
a
new
twist
to
writing
that
I
ended
up
really
enjoying.
I
was
allowed
to
write
in
any
form
that
I
wanted,
from
surveys
to
poems
to
fictional
stories.
I
also
was
able
to
write
joint
articles
with
other
editors
on
the
staff
which
was
a
rewarding
experience
for
me
in
that
it
gave
me
the
first
constructive
feedback
I
had
ever
received
from
my
peers.
I
enjoyed
working
with
other
writers
on
the
same
stories
because
it
allowed
me
to
concentrate
on
my
strong
points
as
a
writer
and
leave
the
rest
to
someone
else.
Before
every
issue
was
submitted
to
the
layout
staff,
our
advisor,
who
was
also
a
teacher
in
the
English
department,
would
go
over
our
articles
with
us.
I
think
that
this
was
especially
beneficial
to
a
writer
like
myself,
because
this
teacher
was
exposed
to
our
writing
over
a
period
of
an
entire
year,
so
he
really
got
a
good
look
at
our
progression.
I
ended
up
becoming
really
good
friends
with
this
teacher,
and
he
helped
most
of
us
with
our
writing
even
after
the
newspaper
quotas
had
gone
out.
I
used
to
bring
all
of
my
other
papers
to
him
during
the
year,
and
he
would
point
out
my
strong
points,
and
give
me
feedback
as
to
what
my
general
oversights
were
and
how
I
could
improve
my
writing
style
as
a
whole.
I
continued
writing
for
the
paper
for
the
next
two
years,
and
I
can
honestly
say
that
if
I
had
not
been
a
part
of
the
newspaper
staff,
I
don't
think
that
my
writing
skills
would
have
been
adequately
prepared
for
college.
When
the
time
came
to
apply
to
college,
I
was
absolutely
dreading
having
to
write
a
collection
of
essays
for
the
applications.
My
confidence
as
a
writer
has
always
been
pretty
low.
Our
high
school
English
department
has
never
been
one
of
the
strongest
departments
in
the
school,
in
fact,
it
is
notorious
for
being
outright
horrible.
Unless
you
were
placed
in
Honors
English
by
grade
6,
you
remained
in
the
general
level,
and
were
basically
overlooked.
We
were
never
required
to
read
the
majority
of
the
classics,
and
I
am
finding
out
now
that
I
have
really
missed
out
on
an
entire
portion
of
my
education.
Books
that
I
should
have
read
in
high
school
are
constantly
being
referred
to
now
that
I
am
in
college,
and
the
bulk
of
it
is
completely
foreign
to
me.
Despite
this
lack
of
instruction,
I
did
find
one
aspect
of
my
high
school,
education
to
be
particularly
outstanding,
and
I
chose
this
as
the
subject
of
my
application
essay's.
My
sophomore
year
a
group
of
students
that
were
enrolled
in
Spanish
classes
were
selected
to
travel
to
Bilbao,
Spain
to
be
the
pioneers
for
an
exchange
program
that
my
high
school
was
trying
to
start
up
with
another
school
in
Bilbao.
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
one
of
those
selected,
and
I
went
with
eleven
others,
most
of
whom
turned
out
to
be
my
good
friends,
and
we
spent
three
weeks
with
families
similar
to
our's
back
in
the
United
States.
The
family
that
I
lived
with
had
three
children,
one
of
which
was
a
daughter
very
close
to
my
age.
I
went
to
school
with
her
everyday
and
went
through
a
series
of
her
classes,
all
taught
in
Spanish.
I
was
required
to
keep
a
journal,
written
in
Spanish,
of
what
they
did
in
classes,
my
reactions
to
their
styles
of
teaching,
the
student
teacher
relations,
etc.
At
the
end
of
the
trip,
we
all
put
our
journals
together
to
compare
our
different
reactions
to
their
high
school
experience.
For
me,
it
was
an
incredible
opportunity
because
I
was
interested
in
continuing
my
Spanish
once
I
got
into
college,
and
we
were
really
forced
to
use
the
language
while
we
were
there,
not
only
verbally,
but
written
as
well.
I
liked
it
because
it
was
a
much
different
experience
from
writing
a
paper
in
your
Spanish
class
back
in
the
United
States.
We
became
used
to
their
methods
of
speech,
and
we
began
to
pick
up
the
slang
and
abbreviations
that
the
kids
our
age
used,
not
just
the
formal,
grammatical
language
that
we
were
taught
in
the
classroom.
We
really
became
a
part
of
their
culture,
and
we
were
able
to
communicate
with
the
other
students
on
a
much
more
personal
level.
I
think
that
this
experience
with
writing
on
a
foreign
level
got
me
more
interested
in
writing,
and
eventually
brought
me
to
my
major
today.
As
a
Spanish
Literature/Art
History
major,
I
am
writing
papers
all
the
time,
most
of
them
in
another
language.
It
has
made
me
aware
of
the
grammatical
aspects
of
writing,
as
I
am
always
going
over
my
Spanish
papers
again
and
again,
finding
new
errors
all
the
time.
I
have
found
it
very
useful
to
bring
them
to
a
Spanish
speaking
student
here
at
Lafayette
who
sort
of
acts
as
my
WA,
and
helps
me
to
correct
all
of
my
stylistic
and
grammar
errors.
This
past
Fall
semester,
I
went
to
Florence,
Italy
to
complete
my
Art
History
major.
One
of
the
classes
that
I
was
taking
was
called
The
Dawn
of
the
Renaissance,
and
we
were
required
to
keep
a
journal
of
our
observations
from
all
of
the
field
trips
and
site
visits
that
we
conducted
as
a
class.
The
professor
asked
that
included
in
our
journal,
we
have
a
sketch
of
that
days
subject,
it's
proper
name
in
Italian,
our
estimates
about
it's
date
and
origin,
and
our
general
feelings
about
the
structure,
whether
we
liked
it,
and
if
not,
why?
Although
this
at
first
seemed
like
more
trouble
than
it
was
worth,
I
came
to
realize
that
recording
my
feelings
and
observations
as
I
progressed
in
the
class
helped
me
to
learn
it
much
more
thoroughly
than
if
I
had
just
taken
it
in
at
the
time,
and
then
tried
to
learn
it
in
one
night
before
the
exam.
It
was
great
to
be
able
to
look
back
on
this
journal
and
see
a
semester's
work,
with
sketches,
as
bad
as
they
may
be,
of
everything
that
we
had
covered
in
that
class.
At
the
close
of
the
semester,
we
were
required
to
turn
our
journals
in
to
the
professor,
and
she
would
in
turn
give
them
back
to
us
with
comments
about
the
conclusions
that
we
had
come
to.
In
general,
her
comments
were
encouraging,
but
she
was
honest
with
us,
and
she
did
tell
me
that
I
tended
to
be
a
little
wordy,
and
that
it
seemed
as
though
this
wordiness
may
be
taking
the
place
of
succinct
conclusions
in
my
writing.
This
did
not
come
as
a
surprise
to
me,
as
I
have
been
told
this
by
my
professors
before,
if
you
can't
already
tell.
I
have
gotten
into
the
habit
of
always
writing
my
papers
on
paper
before
going
to
the
computer.
I
don't
know
if
this
comes
from
always
having
written
them
out
in
high
school,
or
from
the
fact
that
I
am
not
a
very
fast
typist,
but
despite
all
that,
I
continue
to
constantly
start
out
this
way.
It
may
seem
completely
ridiculous
to
go
through
that
long
process
of
always
starting
over
and
scribbling
out,
but
for
me
it
is
so
much
easier
to
get
a
feeling
for
what
I
have
written
if
I
can
hold
it
in
my
hand
and
be
able
to
cross
out
and
add
as
I
please.
Now,
I
know
that
you
would
argue
with
me
and
say
that
yes,
you
can
do
this
on
a
computer
as
well,
but
this
method
has
always
worked
for
me.
I
guess
I
am
a
little
stubborn
in
my
ways,
but
I
will
stand
by
the
fact
that
when
I
write
it
on
paper
first,
my
work
always
turns
out
better.
People
are
always
telling
me
that
this
is
such
a
long
and
drawn
out
way
to
write,
and
I
do
admit
that
after
finishing
a
twenty
page
paper
and
still
having
the
burden
of
transferring
it
all
to
computer
does
get
a
little
discouraging
sometimes,
but
it
always
works
out
better
for
me
in
the
end.
When
I
first
attempted
to
tackle
my
writing
assignments
at
Lafayette
using
this
method,
I
did
find
that
it
was
significantly
harder
than
in
high
school.
Freshman
year
I
was
extremely
critical
of
my
writing
because
I
wasn't
confident
with
my
background
as
a
writer.
I
found
myself
starting
over
again
and
again
before
I
could
even
decide
on
a
thesis
statement
for
most
of
my
papers.
I
remember
one
of
my
first
assignments
being
to
write
a
poem
that
was
eventually
going
to
be
read
to
the
class
and
I
can
honestly
say
that
I
was
absolutely
terrified.
Poetry
has
never
been
my
forte,
but
that
wasn't
my
main
concern,
it
was
the
part
about
reading
it
to
the
class
that
really
got
me.
We
had
been
working
on
a
poetry
unit,
and
I
guess
I
was
feeling
pretty
bad
about
the
class
in
general.
I
felt
like
my
interpretations
were
never
as
insightful
as
the
others,
and
I
used
to
always
ask
the
guy
next
to
me
to
help
me
out
every
time
the
professor
wasn't
looking.
This
probably
came
from
my
lack
of
an
English
background,
and
it
really
bothered
me
that
I
was
already
feeling
out
of
place
and
it
was
only
my
freshman
year.
Needless
to
say,
I
made
it
through
my
first
English
class
at
Lafayette
without
any
serious
wounds,
and
I
actually
did
pretty
well.
Although
I
was
discouraged
from
becoming
an
English
major,
I
wasn't
exactly
scarred
for
life.
Our
next
assignment
turned
out
to
be
more
of
a
response
paper
rather
than
a
work
that
was
entirely
our
own,
so
my
confidence
was
mildly
restored.
By
the
end
of
my
freshman
year
I
felt
significantly
better
about
the
whole
situation
when
I
realized
that
the
majority
of
my
friends
were
all
feeling
the
same
way.
I
guess
it's
just
one
of
those
things
that
you
go
through
as
a
freshman,
and
now
that
I
think
about
it,
I
felt
the
same
way
my
freshman
year
in
high
school.
Now
that
I
look
back
on
the
heaps
of
papers
that
I
have
done,
I
can
confidently
say
that
I
actually
made
it
through
OK.
I
think
that
my
two
different
majors
helped
me
grow
as
a
writer,
and
I
can
honestly
say
that
if
I
had
to
do
it
again,
I
would
have
picked
the
same
majors.
Just
being
exposed
to
writing
in
two
different
languages
has
helped
me
to
become
aware
of
so
many
more
styles
and
periods
of
writing
than
I
had
expected.
Now
that
I
think
about
it,
I
am
so
much
closer
to
an
English
major
than
I
had
ever
anticipated.
I
hope
that
doesn't
come
across
as
an
insult
to
English
majors,
(and
I
can
see
where
it
might
after
having
read
this
feeble
attempt
at
writing
in
the
middle
of
the
summer),
but
I
feel
that
I
have
done
so
much
more
with
my
writing
than
I
had
ever
expected.
I
hope
that
as
a
WA
I
can
do
even
more
as
a
writer,
and
learn
from
being
exposed
to
others'
writing.
