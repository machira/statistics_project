A
Written
History
W.A.
Project
8/28/95
My
first
attempt
at
writing,
as
well
as
I
can
remember,
was
in
second
grade.
My
elementary
school
had
a
yearly
program
that
required
all
students
in
the
school
to
write
a
creative
story
based
on
a
single
introductory
sentence
given
to
all
students.
The
stories
would
then
be
judged
and
an
award
given
to
the
student
in
each
grade
level
who
was
deemed
to
have
written
the
best
story.
The
introductory
sentence
that
year,
which
I
thoroughly
hated,
was
sci-fi
in
nature,
and
the
story
was
to
take
place
many
years
in
the
future.
I
did
not
want
to
write
about
this
and
found
a
normally
active
imagination
almost
out
of
ideas.
This
experience
in
writing
taught
me
early
on
something
invaluable
about
myself
as
a
writer:
being
forced
to
write
on
a
topic
that
I
dislike
for
whatever
reason
is
bound
to
produce
a
work
that
I
consider
dull
and
unimaginative.
A
similar
experience
involving
that
same
writing
program
occurred
my
sixth
grade
year.
Again,
I
did
not
like
the
introductory
sentence
that
much.
However,
I
implemented
irony,
a
writing
technique
that
I
had
learned
about
that
year.
My
story
was
selected
as
the
winner
at
the
sixth
grade
level,
probably
because
I
used
irony.
Keeping
this
experience
in
mind,
I
realized
that
I
might
consider
a
story
or
paper
dull
if
I
do
not
like
the
topic
only
because
I
do
not
have
a
good
experience
writing
it.
I
learned
that
I
consider
a
paper
interesting
if,
as
I
am
writing
it,
the
story
seems
to
flow
easily.
In
my
freshman
year
in
high
school,
my
English
teacher
required
the
class
to
keep
a
writer's
journal
for
a
marking
period.
The
instructions
were
to
limit
the
journal
basically
to
observations
and
nothing
you
would
not
want
anyone
else
to
read.
At
first
this
was
a
hassle
being
that
the
class
was
told
to
write
in
their
journals
at
least
three
times
a
week.
I
disliked
trying
to
be
more
observant,
looking
around
for
things
just
to
write
about
in
my
journal
to
fulfill
my
teacher's
requirement.
At
the
end
of
the
first
month,
I
began
to
notice
that
my
entries
seemed
to
come
much
more
naturally.
I
began
to
enjoy
writing
about
how
the
things
I
saw
affected
me,
sometimes
determining
whether
or
not
I
had
a
good
day.
By
the
conclusion
of
the
marking
period,
I
had
become
a
much
more
observant
person.
I
also
began
to
look
at
things
in
different
ways.
It
was
at
this
point
in
my
life
that
I
became
sensitive
to
the
actual
effects
of
actions
on
people.
Cause
and
effect
became
real.
This
realization
made
my
writing
more
sensitive
because
I
learned
that
not
only
huge
catostrophes
have
effects
on
people,
but
also
little
things.
I
had
my
first
experience
with
term
papers
in
my
sophomore
year
of
high
school.
As
it
turned
out,
I
had
to
write
two
the
last
marking
period
of
that
school
year.
For
my
history
class,
the
term
paper,
of
course,
had
to
be
something
historical.
For
my
English
class,
the
term
paper
could
be
on
any
subject
as
long
as
it
met
the
teacher's
approval.
I
had
been
dreading
the
term
paper.
It
seemed
all
the
educational
horror
stories
I
had
heard
up
until
this
point
in
my
career
involved
either
term
papers
or
calculus.
Now
I
had
two
term
papers
to
deal
with.
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
learn
that,
after
selecting
a
topic,
a
term
paper
is
not
that
much
more
difficult
than
any
other
paper.
The
only
problems
were
following
the
teacher's
exact
instructions
and
meeting
the
page
requirement.
Upon
finishing,
I
felt
that
I
had
done
a
good
job
writing
my
term
papers
and
I
was
rewarded
with
good
grades.
My
teachers
complemented
my
work
and
I
felt
really
good
about
my
writing
for
the
first
time.
In
my
junior
year
I
participated
in
a
science
fair
that
required
a
ten
minute
presentation
to
explain
a
project
that
the
participants
had
performed.
I
was
nervous;
this
was
the
first
time
I
had
to
present
a
fairly
long
speech
and
on
an
experiment
that
I
had
devised.
To
make
it
even
harder,
the
presenters
had
to
incorporate
transparencies
into
their
speeches.
This
meant
that
I
had
to
know
my
information
inside
and
out
so
that
index
cards
would
not
be
in
the
way
as
I
manuevered
transparencies.
I
worked
hard
on
this
speech.
My
work
involved
much
research,
checking
facts,
and
finding
ways
to
say
things
so
that
they
were
understandable
and
maybe
a
little
bit
entertaining.
I
found
that
what
I
had
originally
thought
was
such
a
long
time
to
present
became
a
huge
limitation
to
getting
my
point
across.
By
the
time
the
event
rolled
around,
however,
I
was
completely
familiar
with
my
presentation
and
the
whole
thing
went
smoothly.
I
earned
a
first
place
and
learned
that
I
am
not
as
bad
at
giving
speeches
as
I
thought.
My
English
teacher
junior
year
was
unlike
any
I
had
ever
had
before.
He
actually
wanted
a
paper
almost
every
two
weeks.
This
was
an
alien
concept.
Up
until
then,
I
had
been
pampered
by
teachers
who
never
demanded
much
of
anything.
I
mark
this
as
the
beginning
of
thinking
of
myself
as
a
writer.
It
was
also
in
this
class
that
I
realized
that
with
a
little
work
I
could
become
a
decent
writer.
Through
my
teacher's
encouragement
and,
yes,
his
criticism,
I
learned
how
to
make
a
paper
or
a
story
something
that
was
mine.
I
guess
I
developed
a
style.
Though
not
anything
impressive,
it
was
a
style
that
was
mine
and
could
be
recognized
as
such.
My
teacher
also
taught
me
not
to
be
afraid
of
the
vocabulary
that
I
had
learned
through
years
of
avid
reading.
My
papers
became
something
that
I
could
be
proud
of
because
they
were
distinctly
mine.
Reading
over
things
I
wrote
then,
I
recognize
a
style
similar
to
what
I
use
in
my
writing
now.
The
following
year,
much
of
the
writing
I
did
centered
around
reading
literature
and
writing
papers
on
how
I
interpreted
it.
Mrs.
Kudlick,
my
English
teacher,
wanted
the
interpretations
to
be
backed
up
by
facts
from
reading
material
and
be
persuasive
enough
so
that
a
reader
would
believe
whatever
interpretation
you
held.
This
was
challenging,
but
it
taught
me
not
to
make
judgements
without
supporting
them.
It
may
seem
obvious
to
support
my
ideas
with
facts
now,
but
up
until
that
time
writing
in
this
way
was
something
that
I
had
taken
for
granted
and
only
done
part
of
the
time.
Mrs.
Kudlick's
constant
demands
that
her
students
make
her
believe
made
my
writing
more
persuasive
and
prepared
me
for
what
I
could
expect
in
college.
Writing
in
college
was
something
I
dreaded.
Up
until
this
point,
almost
all
my
papers
had
been
thrown
together
the
night
before
they
were
due.
I
was
not
sure
if
I
would
be
able
to
give
myself
enough
time
to
put
a
paper
together
the
right
way.
Also,
even
if
I
did
give
myself
enough
time,
would
the
finished
product
be
up
to
par
with
college
standards?
If
my
writing
was
not
good
enough,
would
this
mean
I
had
to
change
my
writing
habits?
Then
that
whole
computer
thing.
I
knew
my
papers
would
all
have
to
be
typed,
so,
to
help,
my
parents
bought
me
a
computer.
I
was
computer
illiterate
and
not
necessarily
ready
to
change
my
ways.
I
had
always
just
written
my
papers
in
pen
and
handed
them
in
that
way.
All
normal
college
anxiety
with
computer-phobia
thrown
in.
Thankfully,
I
acquainted
myself
with
my
computer
quickly
and
learned
to
write
while
typing
at
the
keyboard.
Still,
I
had
to
work
hard
to
write
at
what
I
thought
college
level
would
be.
Then
I
had
to
overcome
my
fear
of
letting
others
read
my
writing.
I
found
out
quickly
that
to
know
exactly
what
a
professor
wants
requires
sharing
ideas
among
students.
This
was
hard
for
me
because
all
through
high
school,
the
only
people
that
read
what
I
wrote
were
teachers
and
then
only
because
I
had
to
let
them.
I
always
thought
that
writing
was
a
very
personal
thing
and
a
way
to
really
get
to
know
how
someone
thinks.
This
romantic
vision
of
mine
was
soon
dashed
through
lab
partners,
peer
critics,
and
W.A.'s.
However,
getting
over
all
my
little
fears
made
my
writing
much
better.
The
first
assignment
I
got
in
my
first
year
seminar
seemed
utterly
impossible.
I
was
certain
that
I
would
fail
the
paper
and
probably
the
course.
After
sitting
down
and
thinking
for
a
long
time,
I
realized
that
I
had
ideas,
but
I
still
was
not
sure
how
to
present
them.
That
is
when
I
made
friends
with
my
W.A.
It
was
good
to
know
that
there
was
someone
there
to
let
me
know
if
I
was
headed
in
the
right
direction.
After
working
for
what
seemed
like
forever,
I
handed
in
my
paper
and
waited
to
see
what
my
professor
thought
of
it.
When
the
papers
were
handed
back,
I
knew
this
was
the
moment
of
truth:
how
horrible
is
my
writing?
Thankfully,
my
professor
did
not
think
it
was
too
bad,
nor
did
she
think
is
was
all
that
great.
I
had
to
revise,
but,
all
in
all,
I
had
a
clue
as
to
what
was
going
on.
After
revising,
I
handed
my
paper
back
and
my
grade
improved.
I
realized
then
that
I
was
capable
of
writing
at
the
level
I
was
expected
to,
but
I
just
had
to
work
harder
and
take
advantage
of
resources.
Office
hours
and
W.A.'s
are
very
important
to
understanding
what
is
expected
in
an
assignment
and
I
was
lucky
to
find
this
out
as
early
as
I
did.
My
next
challenge
in
my
seminar
was
a
paper
about
a
poet
whose
poetry
was
almost
impossible
for
me
to
understand.
If
I
had
not
failed
the
first
paper,
this
was
the
one
I
was
going
to
fail.
I
did
not
know
how
to
write
about
something
I
did
not
understand,
but
I
did
what
I
could
with
what
I
learned
in
class
about
the
poet's
style
and
made
up
a
thesis
statement
and
went
from
there.
After
what
seemed
like
a
never-ending
struggle,
I
finished
my
paper
and
handed
it
in.
I
was
shocked
to
find
out
that
my
professor
wanted
my
permission
to
make
copies
of
my
paper
to
hand
out
to
the
rest
of
the
class.
At
this
point,
I
was
surprised
to
find
that
my
professor
thought
highly
of
my
writing
and
truly
started
to
believe
that
hard
work
was
definitely
the
key
to
good
writing.
Then
there
was
the
lab
issue.
All
through
high
school,
I
had
taken
many
science
courses,
but
lab
reports
were
never
required.
Now
I
had
to
learn
how
to
write
them
and
quickly
because
labs
were
required
in
three
of
my
first
semester
classes.
I
was
embarrassed
to
ask
anyone
how
to
write
them
the
right
way
because
I
thought
it
was
something
everyone
should
know.
Luckily,
most
of
my
instructors
for
labs
graded
easily
on
the
first
few
lab
assignments.
I
was
able
to
get
the
hang
of
scientific
writing
and
I
got
pretty
good
at
writing
lab
reports.
Still,
I
always
felt
like
I
was
forgetting
something
or
using
incorrect
phrasing.
The
biggest
problem
was
the
calculus
lab.
I
did
not
understand
how
to
write
about
math.
In
addition
to
doing
a
problem,
I
now
had
to
explain
what
theories
were
applicable
and
why.
I
am
still
not
comfortable
writing
about
calculus
after
two
semesters
of
labs.
However,
I
adjusted
to
chemistry
and
biology
labs
much
more
easily.
It
was
also
during
first
semester
freshman
year
that
I
learned
about
writing
grant
proposals.
This,
to
me,
seemed
really
interesting.
It
was
like
the
science
fairs
that
I
used
to
participate
in
on
a
much
larger
scale.
There
was
much
research
involved,
but
it
was
research
on
a
topic
that
I
chose
myself.
After
developing
a
project,
it
was
necessary
to
write
about
the
research
that
was
done
and
give
valid
reasons
for
doing
the
proposed
project.
Once
the
paper
was
written,
a
budget
had
to
be
made
to
determine
the
costs
of
the
experiment.
This
was
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
papers
I
ever
wrote.
This
paper
was
also
a
good
test
of
the
skills
I
had
learned
by
writing
lab
reports.
I
got
a
fairly
good
grade
and
was
pleased
with
the
overall
results.
The
following
semester,
I
had
to
write
another
grant
proposal.
I
looked
over
my
mistakes
from
the
first
paper
and
learned
what
I
could
do
to
write
a
better
paper.
After
finding
a
new
topic
and
doing
research,
I
finished
the
paper
of
which
I
am
the
most
proud
through
all
my
years
of
writing.
This
feeling
was
intensified
when
my
professor
asked
for
a
copy
of
the
paper
for
use
in
other
classes.
It
was
this
paper
that
gave
me
the
sense
that
I
could
be
a
W.A.
and
gave
me
the
extra
push
I
needed
to
apply
for
a
position
in
the
Writer's
Program.
Up
until
this
point,
I
felt
my
writing
was
okay,
nothing
too
impressive.
Though
my
writing
still
is
not
impressive,
with
the
encouragement
of
my
biology
professor,
I
learned
that
I
have
the
potential
to
be
a
good
enought
o
look
at
other's
papers
and
offer
suggestions
on
improvement.
