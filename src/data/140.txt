WRITING
LIKE
A
W.A.
August

Project
for
Workshop
Fall
1997
The
dominant
theme
during
my
past
year
as
a
writer
was
the
importance
of
preparation.
I
found
that
in
order
to
obtain
optimum
quality
in
my
work,
as
well
as
my
life,
it
was
necessary
to
take
time
to
formulate
and
organize
my
thoughts
before
I
jumped
directly
into
middle
of
a
difficult
assignment.
Developing
a
solid
structure
to
my
papers
eliminated
the
overwhelming
sense
of
stress
which
had
often
accompanied
me
while
I
sat
and
attempted
to
express
what
felt
like
a
thousand
separate
thoughts
onto
a
mere
seven
sheets
of
paper.
Armed
with
one
single
piece
of
paper
which
contained
my
basic
structure
for
the
paper,
I
was
able
to
easily
combat
the
frustration
of
those
agonizing,
unorganized
thoughts
which
seem
to
be
impossible
to
express
in
one
coherent
writing.
I
owe
much
of
my
wonderful
discovery
of
structure
to
my
writing
students
who
graciously
allowed
me
to
share
their
writing
experiences
with
them.
As
a
fellow
writer,
I
know
just
how
personal
the
entire
process
of
developing
a
paper
can
be.
Many
of
my
writing
students
came
to
me
feeling
deeply
frustrated
and
overwhelmed
by
their
assignment.
The
assignments
which
were
administered
were
papers
which
required
a
deep
amount
of
thought
process
while
only
allowing
for
a
brief
amount
of
actual
writing
(about
five
pages).
Students
often
opened
an
appointment
by
complaining
about
how
impossible
it
was
to
fit
all
their
thoughts
and
ideas
into
such
a
short
paper.
These
same
students
were
the
ones
whose
first
drafts
seemed
too
jumbled
and
incoherent
to
even
read.
When
I
read
these
first
drafts,
my
initial
reaction
was
to
think
that
the
writer
either
was
not
interested
enough
or
did
not
care
enough
about
the
assignment
to
write
a
proper
paper.
After
I
met
with
these
same
students,
I
found
out
that
the
exact
opposite
was
actually
true.
These
students
were
the
ones
who
were
so
interested
in
the
assignment
that
they
were
overwhelmed
by
their
own
thoughts
and
ideas.
It
was
not
that
they
had
no
thoughts
or
ideas
to
express,
but
rather
that
they
had
too
many
ideas
and
thoughts
to
express.
As
I
began
to
realize
the
obvious
frustration
that
my
writing
students
were
feeling,
I
became
aware
that
I
often
encounter
the
same
exact
inability
to
adequately
express
my
thoughts
in
an
organized
fashion
on
paper.
I
proceeded
to
attempt
to
aid
the
students
by
forcing
them
to
organize
their
thoughts.
I
did
this
by
having
each
individual
writing
student
state
each
separate
idea
out
loud.
This
helped
the
writing
student
separate
one
idea
from
another.
Next,
I
had
the
writing
student
proceed
to
tell
me
which
ideas
were
more
important
than
others.
After
these
first
two
steps
were
completed,
the
writing
student
would
write
down
on
paper
her
individual
ideas
in
order
of
importance
in
her
upcoming
paper
assignment.
Now
the
writing
student
had
a
much
easier
time
developing
a
paper
outline
which
consisted
of
her
ideas
in
order
of
their
importance.
After
each
main
idea,
the
writing
student
could
write
down
what
important
aspects
of
the
idea
he/she
would
like
to
cover
in
his/her
paper.
If
the
writing
student
felt
that
he/she
had
too
many
ideas
to
bring
into
the
brief
assignment,
he/she
could
easily
eliminate
one
of
his/her
ideas
from
the
bottom
of
his/her
list.
The
writing
students
genuinely
appreciated
my
help.
Upon
their
second
visits,
their
faces
seemed
to
show
much
less
stress
and
there
attitude
seemed
much
more
optimistic
toward
their
second
assignment
than
it
had
for
their
first
assignment.
After
realizing
the
large
benefits
that
structure
had
given
my
writing
students,
I
had
a
brilliant
epiphany
that
I
should
possibly
take
my
own
advice.
I
began
to
follow
the
same
simple
guidelines
that
I
had
taught
my
writing
students.
I
could
not
believe
how
much
easier
it
was
to
tame
my
wild
and
tangled
thoughts
with
the
help
of
an
outline
rather
than
endlessly
struggle
with
a
confusing
first
draft.
Once
my
basic
thoughts
were
staring
up
at
me
from
a
piece
of
paper,
I
could
begin
a
more
coherent
first
draft
which
flowed
with
consistent
ideas
and
arguments.
I
was
free
from
the
cruel
restraint
of
ideas
which
seem
too
abstract
and
too
confusing
for
any
audience
to
possibly
understand.
This
freedom
allowed
me
to
concentrate
on
what
I
was
truly
trying
to
argue
in
my
paper.
The
end
result
were
papers
of
a
much
higher
caliber.
Structure
has
also
played
a
new
role
for
me
when
dealing
with
my
responsibilities
as
a
writing
associate.
This
past
year
I
learned
that
in
order
to
successfully
perform
my
job
as
a
responsible
wa,
it
was
crucial
for
me
to
first
set
up
a
structured
plan
concerning
my
responsibilities.
Before
I
began
my
conferences,
I
wrote
down
all
the
responsibilities
which
I
would
have
to
maintain
throughout
the
year.
For
example,
after
speaking
to
my
professor
(whose
name
will
be
conveniently
withheld),
I
wrote
down
the
exact
times
that
I
would
be
meeting
with
him
throughout
the
semester.
By
developing
a
type
of
schedule
in
advance,
I
easily
eliminated
any
future
anxieties
over
finding
a
time
when
both
my
professor
and
I
would
be
available.
I
also
spoke
to
my
professor
in
advance
about
what
my
responsibilities
were
and
what
my
responsibilities
were
not.
The
Xerox
entitled,
"
What
your
writing
associate
wants
you
to
know",
was
very
helpful
at
this
time.
I
asked
my
professor
many
questions
about
what
he
expected
from
me
as
a
writing
associate,
as
well
as
what
he
expected
of
his
students
as
writing
students.
I
also
made
sure
that
I
was
well
informed
about
the
format
of
his
papers
and
what
exactly
he
expected
from
each
assignment.
By
learning
about
my
professor's
expectations
in
advance,
I
was
better
able
to
adequately
prepare
myself
for
the
responsibilities
which
lay
ahead
as
well
as
structure
my
writing
associate
meetings
in
the
most
productive
style.
Having
knowledge
of
my
responsibilities
in
advance
proved
to
be
essential
in
one
particular
confrontation
between
my
professor
and
myself.
My
professor
had
scheduled
the
last
set
of
writing
associate
meetings
for
his
class
during
the
week
of
finals.
He
attempted
to
defend
his
choice
be
claiming
that
there
was
simply
not
enough
time
for
him
to
give
the
papers
any
earlier.
He
told
me
that
although
he
knew
it
would
be
extremely
hard
on
me
to
attempt
to
give
both
writing
associate
meetings
and
study
for
my
finals,
he
had
no
other
choice.
If
I
had
not
previously
informed
my
professor
of
when
I
was
available
for
wa
appointments,
I
may
have
buckled
in
to
his
request
and
given
the
wa
appointments
despite
the
crippling
effect
they
would
have
probably
had
on
my
grades.
But,
having
already
informed
my
professor
that
a
wa
has
absolutely
zero
responsibility
to
hold
any
kind
of
writing
meetings
during
the
week
of
finals,
I
felt
secure
enough
to
deny
his
request.
Although
I
felt
bad
that
he
would
have
to
cram
all
his
papers
into
a
shorter
period
of
time,
it
was
not
my
responsibility
as
a
wa
to
hold
appointments
because
I
needed
to
concern
myself
with
my
own
school
work.
I
also
found
it
absolutely
mandatory
for
me
to
develop
an
outline
in
advance
which
allowed
me
to
clearly
see
when
I
was
available
on
any
given
day
of
the
week.
This
written
schedule
allowed
me
to
quickly
see
when
I
could
schedule
my
wa
appointments
for
the
upcoming
semester.
This
schedule
also
proved
itself
to
be
invaluable
when
desperate
writing
students
would
call
me
and
ask
me
for
a
last
minute
appointment.
Without
this
schedule,
I
would
probably
have
scheduled
many
meetings
which
I
could
not
attend.
The
past
year's
theme
of
preparation
also
carried
over
into
the
realm
of
my
authority
as
a
wa.
During
my
writing
associate
orientation,
I
was
warned
that
many
writing
students
attempt
to
take
advantage
of
their
writing
associate.
I
was
told
that
it
is
important
to
have
a
firm
understanding
of
exactly
what
the
wa
job
entails
and
what
it
does
not
entail.
After
hearing
this
warning
several
times,
I
knew
that
I
must
decide
in
advance
what
I
would
tolerate
as
a
wa
and
what
I
would
not
tolerate.
I
wrote
down
what
my
policies
would
be
as
a
wa.
For
example,
I
would
not
reschedule
any
appointments
made
by
students
who
had
stood
me
up
at
their
original
scheduled
time.
I
would
only
allow
a
student
to
reschedule
an
appointment
if
that
student
had
called
to
cancel
in
advance,
with
a
valid
excuse.
I
would
also
not
allow
for
any
student
to
come
to
the
appointments
without
a
draft
for
me
to
read.
This
eliminated
my
merely
being
an
idea
giver
rather
than
someone
who
is
there
to
help
them
improve
a
tangible
draft
of
a
paper.
By
developing
a
structure
concerning
my
expectations
and
authority
as
a
wa,
I
was
able
to
inform
my
students
of
the
boundaries
and
rules
which
I
felt
I
deserved.
One
particular
example
where
stating
my
expectations
in
advance
proved
to
be
absolutely
crucial
dealt
with
a
student
(whose
name
will
be
withheld
due
to
the
obvious
embarrassment)
who
continuously
missed
appointments.
This
student
called
in
advance
when
the
first
time
she
missed
an
appointment,
and
in
accordance
to
my
set
rules,
I
allowed
the
student
to
reschedule
an
appointment.
But,
to
my
utter
dismay,
this
same
student
completely
stood
me
up
for
our
rescheduled
appointment.
She
left
me
waiting
in
the
wa
room
wondering
why
any
student
would
take
the
time
to
reschedule
an
appointment
only
to
completely
disrespect
their
wa
by
blowing
the
appointment
off.
The
next
day
this
same
student
telephoned
me
and
explained
how
truly
sorry
she
was
and
how
she
had
simply
forgotten
our
appointment
due
to
her
very
busy
schedule.
She
also
asked
if
I
could
find
it
in
my
heart
to
give
her
another
appointment
time
because
without
a
meeting
with
the
wa
she
would
write
a
paper
that
was
doomed
to
receive
an
'
f.
I
reminded
her
that
I
has
set
up
rules
at
the
beginning
of
our
first
meeting
which
had
to
be
kept.
I
told
her
that,
although
I
was
sorry
about
her
possibly
receiving
a
low
grade
on
her
paper,
I
could
not
bend
the
rules
for
her
because
then
everybody
would
demand
that
I
bend
the
rules
for
them
as
well.
I
reminded
them
that
my
policy
was
to
not
reschedule
any
appointments
made
by
students
who
had
stood
me
up.
Although
the
student
hung
up
the
phone
in
a
far
from
polite
manner,
I
did
not
feel
bad
at
all
because
I
knew
that
the
student
had
been
notified
of
my
rules
in
advance
and
had
chosen
to
ignore
them.
Preparation
also
proved
itself
to
be
an
absolutely
crucial
component
in
my
attempts
to
conquer
one
particular
advanced
political
theory
class
this
past
year.
I
feel
it
necessary
to
mention
that
the
professor
of
this
advanced
course
was
also
the
professor
of
the
beginning
political
theory
course
to
which
I
am
assigned
as
a
wa
(have
you
figured
out
this
mystery
man
yet?).
Of
course,
being
a
student
of
the
professor
who
is
also
the
professor
who
has
enough
respect
for
your
abilities
to
allow
you
to
be
his/her
wa
is
very
stressful.
I
wanted
to
prove
to
my
professor
that
I
deserved
all
of
the
literary
praise
that
he
so
often
bestowed
upon
me.
My
enthusiasm
about
writing
a
brilliant
paper
led
to
my
developing
what
felt
like
a
ton
of
different
thoughts
and
ideas
which
all
seemed
to
be
fighting
to
take
precedence
inside
my
head.
As
I
began
to
write
the
papers,
it
was
absolutely
mandatory
for
me
to
prepare
an
outline
of
my
thoughts
in
advance
in
order
to
write
a
paper
of
high
quality
which
held
a
coherent
argument.
Without
the
outline,
I
would
have
stumbled
upon
the
same
inability
to
express
my
thoughts
which
plagued
my
writing
students.
This
summer
I
worked
as
a
camp
counselor
at
a
traveling
day
camp.
Every
day
needed
to
be
carefully
planned
out
in
advance
in
order
to
eliminate
massive
boredom
and
inevitable
chaos.
As
I
carefully
wrote
down
each
days
specific
activities,
I
was
reminded
of
the
similarities
between
living
a
successful
life
and
writing
a
good
paper.
In
both
scenarios,
it
is
mandatory
to
take
the
time
to
prepare
yourself
for
all
important
tasks
in
order
to
prevent
immense
frustration
and
incompetence.
Although
we
may
sometimes
sporadically
choose
a
certain
path
in
life
or
jump
directly
into
the
middle
of
a
first
draft,
we
almost
always
find
ourselves
lost
and
frustrated
later
on.
Therefore,
I
firmly
believe
preparation
is
one
of
the
strongest
pieces
of
advice
anyone
can
give.
