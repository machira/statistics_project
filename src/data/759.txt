WA
Summer
Writing
Assignment
The
Evolution
of
an
Author
It
is
pretty
difficult
for
me
to
remember
a
time
when
I
did
not
use
a
computer
to
write
papers.
I
vaguely
remember
practicing
my
cursive
and
signing
my
name
on
any
pieces
of
paper
I
could
find
lying
around
the
house,
but
I
never
used
a
paper
and
pen
to
write
formal
papers.
The
first
paper
I
did
write
on
the
computer
that
I
remember
truly
identifying
as
my
own
was
my
book
report
on
the
Call
of
the
Wild
in
elementary
school.
I
had
written
a
summary
about
the
book
and
included
my
thoughts
on
the
plot
and
characters.
I
felt
that
it
was
perfect
and
a
masterpiece.
However,
my
father
and
editor
at
the
time,
did
not
agree.
His
various
corrections
to
my
spelling
and
grammar
infuriated
me.
I
felt
that
he
had
completely
changed
my
report
and
ruined
my
voice
in
the
paper.
Whether
that
was
true
or
not,
I
do
not
recall,
but
I
know
that
it
was
the
first
time
I
saw
the
power
of
writing
to
express
my
own
voice
and
always
tried
to
make
personal
voice
come
through
in
all
my
writing
from
that
point
onward.
My
relationship
with
writing
before
that
book
report
was
not
one
of
love.
I
would
purposely
get
up
to
go
to
the
bathroom
or
get
a
drink
of
water
whenever
we
had
writing
tasks
because
I
could
not
stand
to
sit
for
thirty
minutes
and
make
up
a
story.
After
that
book
report,
however,
I
was
able
to
throw
myself
into
my
writing
more
and
began
to
enjoy
the
assignments
I
got
from
my
teachers.
I
did
not
always
write
papers,
though.
When
I
was
in
middle
school
I
really
began
to
look
into
poetry.
I
thought
it
was
a
wonderful
way
to
write
about
my
emotions
without
being
overly
dramatic
and
lengthy.
I
thought
it
was
amazing
that
such
few
words
could
create
such
an
impact
on
others.
My
religion
class
asked
me
to
write
a
poem
for
a
contest
that
the
Archbishop
was
having.
I
had
a
pretty
difficult
time
figuring
out
what
to
do,
but
I
was
able
to
outline
what
I
wanted
to
write
about
and
made
a
rough
copy.
I
edited
and
changed
that
poem
so
many
times
that
by
the
time
it
was
done,
I
had
a
totally
different
poem.
I
ended
up
winning
fourth
place
in
the
contest,
but
that
gave
me
great
confidence
in
my
writing,
as
well
as
helped
me
better
understand
the
editing
process.
In
high
school,
I
really
enjoyed
writing
analytical
papers
in
AP
U.S.
and
AP
European
History
in
which
I
was
able
to
use
facts
to
persuade
others.
I
learned
how
to
use
other
sources
to
support
my
arguments
as
well
as
critically
analyze
another
individualOs
writing
for
bias.
It
was
one
of
the
first
times
I
thought
to
question
the
writing
of
a
reputable
source,
but
it
taught
me
that
every
piece
of
literature
is
writing
by
a
human
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
completely
remove
perspective
from
that
process.
In
the
end,
every
essay
or
article
is
influenced
somewhat
by
the
thoughts
and
experiences
of
the
individual
writing
it.
I
also
began
to
write
more
scientific
papers,
such
as
lab
reports.
This
was
a
very
different
type
of
writing.
As
opposed
to
using
facts
to
support
your
opinion,
scientific
papers
were
completely
void
of
opinion
and
simply
reported
the
observations
made.
These
papers
also
had
a
very
specific
structure.
Where
my
English
literature
class
allowed
me
to
expand
upon
ideas
and
use
beautiful
descriptions
to
paint
a
picture
in
somebodyOs
mind,
my
AP
Chemistry
class
removed
that
freedom
and
replaced
it
with
a
formula
that
had
little
room
for
changes.
I
didnOt
realize
it
at
the
time,
but
those
would
be
the
types
of
papers
I
would
be
writing
for
several
years
to
come.
Towards
the
end
of
high
school,
I
was
required
to
write
somewhat
of
a
personal
statement
for
my
college
applications.
This
was
the
first
paper
I
really
wrote
that
explored
my
inner
self.
I
had
expressed
my
opinions
and
thoughts
on
paper
before,
but
it
was
most
certainly
a
challenge
to
capture
my
most
basic
self
in
one
essay.
I
struggled
to
find
a
topic
and
ended
up
choosing
the
moment
that
I
decided
to
go
in
to
medicine.
The
next
obstacle
I
had
to
face
was
how
to
make
the
moment
seem
as
important
to
others
as
it
had
been
to
me.
It
seemed
strange
that
mailing
an
essay
to
a
complete
stranger
would
allow
them
to
feel
the
same
emotions
I
felt
during
that
time.
I
was
also
slightly
uncomfortable
sharing
those
emotions
with
somebody
I
did
not
know.
It
wasnOt
until
college
that
I
became
fascinated
by
the
influence
ink
can
have
on
other
individuals
and
how
amazing
it
is
that
something
non-physical,
like
words,
can
manifest
themselves
in
thoughts
and
actions.
My
neuroscience
professor
amazed
me
by
pointing
out
that
something
as
insignificant
in
the
world
as
words
can
cause
a
physical
change
in
another
individual.
For
example,
a
cook
book
causes
someone
to
go
out
to
a
store,
buy
the
ingredients,
put
them
all
together,
bake
them,
and
eat
the
product
in
a
very
directed
way
without
the
individual
ever
seeing
somebody
make
the
same
food.
Through
my
FYS
and
my
VAST,
I
was
really
introduced
to
the
level
of
writing
expected
of
me
in
college.
When
I
left
high
school,
I
was
unsure
as
to
whether
I
was
prepared
for
college
level
writing.
I
really
didnOt
know
what
to
expect.
However,
when
my
FYS
was
introduced,
I
was
glad
to
learn
that
my
AP
classes
had
taught
me
how
to
research
and
construct
an
effective
paper
well
and
that
it
had
given
me
a
good
basis
for
college
level
writing.
However,
I
learned
that
there
were
some
important
differences.
For
example,
my
FYS
professor
did
not
want
us
to
write
in
the
typical
five-paragraph
essay
I
had
learned
at
the
beginning
of
high
school.
My
AP
English
class
definitely
began
to
break
me
out
of
that
habit,
but
it
was
most
certainly
still
present
by
the
time
I
came
to
college.
I
also
learned
that
I
would
have
to
do
a
lot
more
research
for
college
papers
due
to
their
complexity.
At
first,
I
was
overwhelmed
by
the
number
of
resources
we
have
on
campus
to
find
different
articles,
but
I
slowly
became
more
comfortable
with
them
as
the
time
went
on.
I
also
became
less
dependent
on
the
physical
books
that
are
available
in
the
library
and
became
more
reliant
on
the
inter
library
loan
program.
It
was
really
a
life
saver
when
doing
research
that
required
a
specific
article
that
was
not
available
at
Lafayette.
While
my
writing
process
of
outlining,
researching,
writing,
and
editing
did
not
change
dramatically
in
college,
I
learned
a
lot
about
the
steps
from
my
WA.
I
had
never
worked
with
anyone
besides
my
father
on
editing
my
papers
and
it
took
me
a
while
to
adjust
to
being
comfortable
with
others
reading
my
papers
and
helped
me
through
the
process;
I
had
always
prided
myself
on
not
needing
several
individuals
to
read
my
writing
before
the
final
product
was
done.
It
was
quite
an
experience
to
work
with
a
WA,
but
I
believe
it
ultimately
got
me
to
think
more
about
my
writing
and
how
it
is
perceived
by
others.
My
experience
working
with
a
WA
became
extremely
useful
when
I
wrote
my
personal
statement
for
medical
school
last
year.
I
was
not
quite
sure
where
to
start,
but
I
was
able
to
use
some
techniques
I
had
learned
from
my
past
WAs
in
order
to
organize
my
thoughts
and
choose
a
topic
to
write
about.
I
was
also
more
willing
to
let
others
read
my
writing
since
I
had
become
more
comfortable
with
it
through
the
years
of
college
writing.
One
of
the
most
challenges
aspects
of
writing
my
personal
statement
was
that
I
never
wanted
to
stop
editing
it.
I
always
felt
that
there
was
a
more
effective
way
to
express
my
emotions
and
motivations
to
others,
or
that
what
I
had
written
did
not
correctly
portray
the
extent
to
which
these
emotions
and
motivations
overcame
me.
Now
that
I
am
taking
on
a
thesis,
I
feel
that
my
past
writing
experiences
are
going
to
manifest
themselves
in
yet
another
way.
I
have
never
worked
on
a
writing
piece
quite
this
long
or
for
such
an
extended
amount
of
time
before.
I
feel
that
I
will
need
my
editing
and
critical
reading
skills
that
I
have
built
up
over
the
past
few
years
in
order
to
write
a
well-formed
paper,
but
that
I
will
also
have
to
depend
on
others
to
provide
me
with
a
fresh
insight
and
ensure
that
my
thoughts
are
clearly
expressed.
I
have
learned
the
value
of
peer
editing,
organizing
thoughts,
and
critical
thinking
as
a
whole
through
my
life
as
a
writer
and
I
am
sure
that
I
will
continue
to
evolve
and
learn
from
it
for
many
years
to
come.
