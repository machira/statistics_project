WA
Summer
Assignment
When
I
was
asked
my
favorite
subject
throughout
elementary
and
middle
school,
English
and
Language
Arts
were
never
even
an
option.
I
hated
not
knowing
the
NrightO
answer
like
I
did
in
Math
and
Science.
And
discovering
how
to
write
well
seemed
like
a
secret
code
I
just
could
not
break.
It
took
an
amazing
English
teacher
in
junior
and
senior
year
of
high
school
for
me
to
realize
that
I
was
approaching
writing
the
wrong
way.
It
is
not
a
noun,
it
is
a
verb.
It
is
not
a
physical
thing
you
reach
out
and
touch
and
say,
NYes,
I
did
it!
I
have
attained
good
writingO
it
is
a
process
that
you
learn
and
create
and
grow
with
over
time,
an
action
that
you
continue
to
do
and
build
on
over
your
lifetime.
NLife
isnOt
about
finding
yourself,
itOs
about
creating
yourselfO
and
I
have
learned
that
writing
is
the
same
way;
it
cannot
be
found,
it
is
created.
Just
like
a
paper
that
you
turn
in
is
not
the
finished
product
and
can
still
be
improved
on,
your
writing
style
as
a
whole
is
something
that
can
be
improved
upon
and
changed
throughout
the
course
of
your
life.
And
in
the
saga
of
my
ongoing
personal
relationship
with
writing,
there
were
definitely
a
few
things
I
picked
up
this
year,
not
even
through
my
own
experiences,
but
through
working
with
students
in
the
College
Writing
Program.
This
was
my
first
year
not
working
with
Professor
WashingtonOs
VAST
course
during
the
spring
and
so
it
provided
me
with
new
challenges.
The
first
new
experience
was
the
longer
drafts.
In
my
previous
courses
the
longest
writing
I
received
was
two
to
three
pages.
But
with
this
new
course
I
was
swamped
with
10
to
15
page
drafts
for
each
student
in
a
much
larger
class.
Before
my
meetings
were
more
focused
on
brainstorming
and
I
considered
the
meeting
a
success
if
the
students
left
with
a
great
outline
and
confidence
in
what
they
needed
to
work
on.
With
these
much
larger
drafts
I
felt
that
the
students
were
much
further
along
in
their
writing
process
and
the
meetings
were
more
based
on
what
had
already
been
written.
So
for
this
VAST
course
a
successful
WA
meeting
was
one
where
I
had
given
a
list
of
things
for
them
to
work
on
and
pay
special
attention
to
when
editing,
and
also
that
they
felt
good
about
the
direction
of
their
paper.
This
professor
also
had
a
penchant
for
directions
with
multiple
parts.
This
meant
that
a
majority
of
the
meetings
were
spent
making
sure
that
the
students
completely
understood
the
prompt
and
that
their
papers
were
directly
answering
the
questions.
A
successful
conference
is
one
in
which
the
student
and
I
felt
that
the
nearly-finished
paper
would
fit
the
instructions
of
the
assignment
by
the
time
it
was
turned
in.
It
was
challenging
reading
such
long
drafts
and
paying
particular
attention
to
ensure
that
they
covered
everything
asked
by
the
prompt.
This
meant
that
I
also
had
to
make
sure
the
studentsO
theses
were
concise
while
still
covering
everything
the
professor
was
looking
for.
The
type
of
assignment
was
different
for
me
this
year
as
well
as
the
content.
Professor
WashingtonOs
courses
usually
deal
with
diversity
and
readings
are
often
from
a
minority
perspective.
But
my
newest
VAST
assignment
was
focused
on
Ancient
Rome,
a
topic
I
do
not
know
in
depth,
but
one
I
am
familiar
with.
One
thing
I
really
love
about
being
a
WA
is
the
chance
I
receive
to
learn
about
diverse
topics
that
I
otherwise
might
not
know
anything
about.
Not
only
will
u
learn
more
about
your
own
writing
and
effective
ways
to
talk
about
writing,
you
also
get
the
chance
to
learn
about
different
subjects.
After
learning
so
much
about
diversity
and
minority
perspectives
through
working
with
Professor
Washington,
as
well
as
pulling
from
my
own
experiences
and
courses
I
have
taken
before,
I
began
to
develop
a
strong
opinion
on
topics
related
to
this
issue.
I
received
a
shock
this
year
when
I
helped
a
student
with
a
paper
during
drop-in
that
dealt
with
affirmative
action.
The
student
was
a
foreign
student
from
Eastern
Europe
and
brought
a
really
interesting
perspective
to
an
argument
I
had
made
up
my
opinion
on
a
long
time
ago.
As
an
African-American
student
I
am
a
proponent
of
affirmative
action
and
I
think
that
concerted
efforts
to
bring
diversity
into
higher
education
are
beneficial
to
everyone
in
a
higher
education
setting.
But
this
student
had
a
really
different
perspective.
She
was
a
foreign
student
from
Eastern
Europe
so
according
to
American
designations
on
entrance
exams
and
applications,
she
was
considered
white.
But
in
reality
her
experience
was
more
similar
to
that
of
students
typically
labeled
minorities.
She
came
from
a
lower-income
family,
she
was
raised
speaking
a
different
language,
and
she
wasnOt
born
in
the
US.
Her
struggle
was
similar
to
minority
students
and
her
odds
of
getting
into
college
were
just
as
low
as
some
minorities.
Yet,
because
of
the
color
of
her
skin,
she
was
not
eligible
for
certain
awards
and
scholarships
that
could
have
made
college
easier
for
her.
When
I
first
read
that
her
draft
would
be
arguing
against
affirmative
action
I
was
ready
to
defend
it
as
I
have
in
the
past
in
a
different
course
I
was
taking
with
another
Lafayette
student.
For
the
first
time
I
was
able
to
see
this
issue
from
a
different
perspective
and
I
learned
more
about
this
topic.
The
argument
of
her
paper
was
that
affirmative
action
was
not
effective
and
that
maybe
a
better
measure
of
need
would
be
socio-economic
status
rather
than
skin
color.
I
think
I
got
a
little
more
of
an
international
perspective
to
this
topic
and
reading
her
paper
and
helping
her
develop
her
topic
and
edit
her
paper
allowed
me
to
learn
as
well.
If
nothing
else,
helping
others
with
their
writing
allows
us
to
challenge
our
preconceived
notions
and
to
see
things
from
another
viewpoint.
However
this
year
was
not
filled
with
all
amazing
experiences.
One
thing
that
is
always
challenging
for
me
is
students
that
do
not
seem
as
interested
in
their
WA
meetings
as
I
am.
In
past
years
I
have
had
students
who
do
not
contribute
at
all
and
expect
me
to
just
tell
them
exactly
what
they
will
do.
This
is
really
frustrating
because
I
enjoy
meetings
that
are
a
conversation
where
they
are
telling
me
what
they
think
needs
work,
just
as
much
as
I
am
telling
them
what
they
need
to
make
sure
and
include.
But
this
year,
along
with
a
few
episodes
of
apathy,
I
also
had
a
really
disappointing
meeting
where
the
student
seemed
to
have
given
up
hope.
I
mentioned
how
this
professor
loved
to
give
assignments
with
multiple
parts
and
in
this
case
the
student
seemed
really
overwhelmed
with
the
assignment.
He
had
trouble
understanding
what
he
was
supposed
to
do
and
had
no
confidence
in
the
12
pages
he
had
already
written.
But
this
student
was
not
just
overwhelmed,
he
was
also
irritated.
So
instead
of
coming
to
our
meeting
willing
and
ready
to
get
as
much
help
as
he
could,
he
came
with
a
defensive
and
unreceptive
attitude.
This
made
it
a
difficult
and
painful
WA
meeting.
Every
time
I
made
a
suggestion
he
would
say,
NI
just
donOt
get
it,
what
does
he
expect
me
to
do?O
Even
his
body
language
was
not
receptive
to
any
advice
as
he
sat
leaned
back
in
his
who
chair
instead
of
close
up
to
the
table
looking
at
his
paper
and
trying
to
make
effective
changes.
In
such
cases,
it
is
really
useful
to
ask
leading
and
open-ended
questions.
Yes-or-no
questions
result
in
very
short
and
somewhat
awkward
meetings.
Open-ended
questions
require
the
students
to
engage
in
the
conference
and
commit
to
working
on
their
paper.
Students
who
are
quiet
or
refuse
to
talk
are
definitely
the
hardest
type
of
student
for
me
to
work
with.
If
I
cannot
find
a
way
to
get
them
engaged
then
I
usually
end
up
just
giving
specific
feedback
and
hoping
that
they
can
make
the
appropriate
edits.
To
some
degree
it
is
up
to
the
student
though
and
I
can
only
do
so
much.
If
a
student
really
wants
to
benefit
from
a
conference
then
they
will
put
in
the
appropriate
amount
of
effort.
One
of
the
best
experiences
this
year
was
when
I
helped
a
fellow
WA
and
then
she
immediately
turned
around
and
helped
me
with
a
very
similar
assignment.
She
had
received
another
of
those
infamously
long,
multi-step
assignments
and
had
trouble
with
outlining
the
assignment
in
order
to
include
all
of
the
components.
We
talked
it
out
step
by
step
and
ended
the
meeting
with
an
outline
she
felt
very
comfortable
with
and
I
could
tell
she
felt
really
optimistic
about
the
rest
of
the
paper.
Not
even
a
week
later
I
received
a
similar
assignment
that
was
complicated
and
had
multiple
steps
on
the
topic
of
the
causes
of
WWI.
I
struggled
for
a
week
trying
to
outline
the
paper
but
every
time
I
started
writing
I
felt
that
it
wasnOt
organized
effectively.
This
fellow
WA
helped
me
outline
the
whole
paper
on
the
chalkboard
to
ensure
that
I
had
included
every
step
and
was
answering
every
part
of
the
prompt
in
a
logical
way.
The
paper
was
due
the
following
morning
and
I
was
still
caught
up
in
trying
to
make
sure
that
I
even
understood
what
the
teacher
was
looking
for,
let
alone
actually
writing
the
paper.
This
situation
really
helped
me
with
a
project
that
I
was
stressing
over.
It
also
reinforced
for
me
the
true
message
of
the
WA
program.
No
one
person
is
higher
than
the
other.
That
is
why
it
is
called
peer
tutoring.
In
some
ways
we
are
equals.
As
WAs
we
have
more
experiences
with
writing,
but
we
can
learn
just
as
much
from
students
as
they
can
learn
from
us
at
times.
I
can
aid
a
WA
who
is
one
of
my
courses
and
she
can
turn
around
and
help
me
during
drop
in.
Then
I
can
turn
around
and
help
a
student
during
drop-in
whose
opinions
and
stance
on
a
topic
can
open
my
eyes
and
teach
me
something
equally
as
important
as
how
to
get
the
best
grade
possible
on
a
paper.
I
think
that
understanding
this
concept
has
been
critical
for
my
writing
process.
And
as
someone
who
is
about
to
enter
the
workforce
and
approach
an
entirely
different
kind
of
writing
than
what
I
have
done
in
undergraduate
work
the
past
four
years
I
am
grateful
for
finally
understanding
this
concept.
My
hope
is
that
the
skills
I
have
learned
and
the
understanding
that
writing
is
not
a
finished
product
will
help
me
as
I
make
the
transition
to
the
workforce.
So
although
I
will
no
longer
be
writing
essays
on
various
subjects,
hopefully
the
skills
I
have
gained
will
allow
me
to
transfer
my
success
in
writing
as
an
undergraduate
into
successful
writing
in
the
work
place.
