Literacy
Narrative
The
first
sharp
memory
I
have
of
writing
concerns
its
building
blocks.
In
nursery
school,
the
class
would
break
for
recess
a
couple
of
times
every
day.
Many
kids
would
spend
this
time
outside
on
the
playground,
or
inside
playing
with
blocks
or
toy
trucks.
I
apparently
had
better
things
to
do.
Instead
of
joining
the
others,
I
marched
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
alphabet
chart,
the
one
with
the
big,
colorful
letters
shaped
like
animals
starting
with
said
letter,
and
sounded
them
out.
Loudly
and
with
clear
relish,
I
stalked
the
hallway
for
the
periodus
duration:
rAyyyy,
beeee,
seeeeis
As
disconcerting
as
this
probably
was
to
my
fellow
teacher,
I
couldnut
help
myself.
Even
as
early
as
five
years
old,
language,
and
soon
after,
writing,
held
a
certain
wonder
to
me
that
didnut
always
work
in
my
favor.
The
reason
this
sense
of
wonder
hasnut
always
worked
in
my
favor
is
because
wonder
is
a
distancing
emotion.
The
other
side
of
wonder
tends
to
be
fear.
As
a
natural
procrastinator,
fear
of
writing
amplifies
this
part
of
me.
There
are
plenty
of
moments
I
can
think
of,
particularly
in
elementary
school
and
middle
school,
where
I
actually
avoided
writing,
whether
academic
or
creative,
because
of
such
fear,
however
undefined
it
was
to
me
at
the
time.
I
remember
being
especially
frustrated
being
assigned
in
fourth
grade
to
write
a
report
on
clouds.
The
assignment
was
simple:
take
down
the
various
information
we
learned
in
class
about
clouds,
go
to
the
library
to
read
a
book
or
two
about
clouds,
and
collect
all
the
information
into
a
single
report.
Easy
peasy,
no?
Other
kids
in
the
class,
the
Susie
Derkins
of
the
world
I
suppose,
seemed
to
go
through
this
process
without
a
hitch.
They
took
notes,
read
a
book
or
two,
and
pounded
out
a
page
or
two
on
clouds.
I
just
didnut
get
it.
How
on
earth
could
they
approach
it
so
casually,
so
calmly?
I
put
it
off,
and
put
it
off,
and
put
it
off,
finagling
my
way
into
a
deadline
extension
before
finally
closing
my
eyes
and
taking
the
plunge
into
some
good
olu
fashioned
C+
work.
I
think
now
in
hindsight
that
it
was
so
hard
for
me
to
get
rolling
on
that
little
fourth
grade
assignment
because
even
then
I
saw
writing
as
somehow
an
extension
of
oneself.
What
the
hell
did
I
know
about
clouds?
By
putting
a
collection
of
information
that
I
gathered
into
written
form,
I
would
necessarily
be
putting
an
aspect
of
myself
that
I
didnut
for
a
second
trust
into
written
form,
giving
that
part
a
level
of
accountability
that
I
wanted
to
avoid.
I
couldnut
then,
and
am
still
hard-pressed
to
now,
think
of
anything
that
leaves
one
more
open,
more
vulnerable,
than
putting
the
direct
product
of
oneus
self
and
body
of
knowledge
onto
paper.
Although
this
was
not
my
first
venture
into
creative
writing,
for
some
reason
I
recall
a
story
that
I
wrote
in
seventh
or
eighth
grade
as
an
important
moment.
We
were
assigned
to
write
a
Halloween
story,
five
or
six
pages
long,
to
put
into
some
class
publication
to
send
home
to
all
the
parents.
I
put
off
the
writing
to
the
last
minute,
as
per
my
custom,
but
then
the
oddest
thing
happened.
I
finished
the
story,
some
idiotic
riff
on
rThe
Legend
of
Sleepy
Hollows
that
I
canut
for
the
life
of
me
remember
more
specifically
than
that
at
the
moment,
and
had
the
fiercest
rush
of
pride
about
it.
I
loved
it.
I
read
it
over
and
over,
furious
at
the
teacherus
editing
suggestions.
I
donut
know
why
exactly
I
felt
this
then
and
not
beforehand,
but
it
was
an
amazing
and
empowering
thing
to
have
created
something
like
that
story,
however
silly
and
poorly
written
it
may
have
been.
The
writing
held
a
great
deal
of
risk,
but
a
great
deal
of
reward
as
well,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
writing
was
successful.
I
suppose
that
the
above
showed
me
the
flipside
of
the
writerly
coin.
After
all,
if
one
can
accept
the
idea
that
the
act
of
writing
somehow
includes
putting
a
part
of
oneself
onto
paper,
it
can
follow
that,
depending
on
the
writing,
one
can
be
terribly
protective
and
proud
of
the
result
in
addition
to
just
being
frightened.
I
found
soon
after
that
this
pride-inspiring
aspect
must
be
contained.
I
donut
remember
to
whom
this
phrase
about
writing
was
attributed,
but
rkill
your
darlingss
comes
to
mind
here.
While
marrying
oneself
to
oneus
writing
is
important
in
giving
one
respect
for
the
writing
and
in
taking
sheer
pleasure
in
the
writing,
there
is
no
way
that
such
pride
should
get
in
the
way
of
the
writingus
quality.
For
some
reason,
high
school
was
not
marked
for
me
by
any
particular
individual
writing
experiences,
except
that
I
did
it
(academic
writing,
I
mean)
a
lot
more
than
I
had
been
in
middle
school
and
elementary
school.
I
suppose
that
the
very
fact
that
no
individual
rwriting
experiencess
stand
out
is
significant.
I
got
so
used
to
the
process
of
writing
essays,
of
writing
a
satisfactory
thesis
and
developing
it
over
the
course
of
3-7
pages
that
it
had
lost
some
of
the
wonder
of
previous
years.
As
a
result,
my
writing
didnut
improve
terribly
much.
It
was
fairly
steady
B/B+
level
work,
but
afflicted
by
the
same
problem
as
hurt
the
middle
school
writing
assignment:
lack
of
editing.
I
didnut
see
any
reason
to
change
it
as
my
aspirations
at
the
time
were
only
in
the
B
range
anyway,
and
editing
seemed
like
a
lot
of
work.
It
meant
having
to
constantly
step
back
and
rethink,
a
concept
which
is
really
anathema
to
essays
that
are
comfortably
and
almost
mindlessly
churned
out.
This
kind
of
casual
approach
to
writing
continued
through
my
first
two
years
or
so
of
college
(not
at
Lafayette).
After
all,
the
work
was
significantly
harder.
The
process
of
procrastinate
and
cram
at
the
last
second
without
editing
was
not
cutting
it
as
B
level
work.
Often
the
grades
would
dip
into
the
Cs,
sometimes
below.
It
still
seemed
to
hold
that
writing
acted
as
an
externalization
of
some
part
of
the
writer,
but
this
meant
that
as
the
subjects
of
academic
writing
became
more
difficult,
the
writing
process
itself
had
to
change.
It
had
to
become
as
mutable
and
adaptable
as
the
thought
that
drove
it.
It
did
not.
I
left
college
two
years
after
I
started.
A
funny
thing
happened
in
the
time
away
from
academic
writing.
I
had
been
away
from
it
so
long
that
I
regained
some
of
the
foreignness
that
writing
originally
had
for
me.
Lafayetteus
College
Writing
course
helped
a
great
deal
with
enhancing
this
ability
to
distance
myself
from
the
writing.
That
particular
course
had
us
look
at
a
wide
variety
of
writing
formats
and
styles,
whether
journalistic,
personal,
academic,
etc.
We
were
never
allowed
to
get
ourselves
set
into
any
one
mindset
about
writing,
but
rather
had
to
constantly
shift
our
perspective
as
students
and
writers.
Such
distancing
and
objectivity
now
carried
over
to
other
academic
subjects.
For
whatever
reason,
I
more
often
started
writing
earlier
rather
than
cramming
at
the
last
minute.
I
found
this
combination
of
distance
and
time
to
be
intensely
important
in
successful
academic
writing.
After
all,
thinking
through
college-level
theses
is
hard.
Developing
those
theses
is
a
difficult
and
arduous
process.
I
think
back
now
to
a
recent
essay
I
wrote
this
last
year.
The
essay
itself
was
no
great
shakes,
but
the
process
I
went
through
to
write
it
is
something
I
strive
now
to
replicate
with
most
assignments
I
get.
The
essay
was
due
in
something
like
two
weeks.
Rather
than
letting
the
thesis
stew
about
in
my
head
idly
for
a
week,
I
immediately
wrote
a
page
or
two
to
act
as
a
working
thesis.
Now
that
some
ideas
were
sitting
in
the
clear
light
of
day
outside
of
the
murky
twilight
of
my
head,
I
could
help
them
move
beyond
their
current
state.
The
editing
and
revision
of
such
a
paper
was
merely
a
continuation
of
this.
Iud
look,
now
from
a
distance
(since
eyes-to-paper
is
a
farther
distance
than
brain-to-brain),
at
where
my
thoughts
were
at
so
far,
and
simply
develop
and
revise,
develop
and
revise.
There
were
certainly
other
ways
for
this
rrevision
by
distances
to
happen.
Talking,
for
instance.
By
talking
to
other
students,
to
my
professors
during
office
hours,
and
to
my
father,
by
repeating
aloud
what
sounded
good
in
my
head
and
on
paper,
I
brought
the
idea
even
further
into
the
sunlight.
It
makes
it
very
difficult
for
an
idea
to
stagnate
when
three
or
four
other
people
give
you
their
perspectives
on
what
stage
the
idea
is
at,
where
it
might
go
from
its
current
state,
and
how
to
get
there.
It
took
a
while
to
get
used
to
such
open
discussion.
At
first
I
was
resistant,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
A
major
reason
is
that
talking
to
people,
extracting
ideas
from
the
mind
and
page
onto
the
tongue,
can
be
horribly
embarrassing.
At
times,
when
I
even
started
to
think
about
opening
my
mouth,
I
might
see
how
an
idea
is
flawed.
Elements
of
pride
and
fear
that
I
described
before
lingered
still.
I
didnut
want
to
have
to
show
someone
else
my
thoughts
and
my
writing
because
I
simply
didnut
want
them
to
knock
down
something
that
I
created.
Kill
your
darlings,
kill
your
darlings.
The
strongest
barrier
I
believe,
even
now,
to
a
writer
bringing
their
ideas
out
into
the
open
early
and
often,
whether
via
talking
to
others
or
just
putting
the
idea
on
paper
early,
is
the
barrier
of
laziness.
It
is
simply
the
case
that
the
act
of
distancing
oneself
from
oneus
writing
is
hard,
and
often
not
necessary
to
get
beyond
a
minimum
level.
It
is
hard
to
talk
about
oneus
writing,
it
is
hard
to
see
the
point,
it
is
hard
do
when
you
have
seemingly
more
pressing.
Why
revise
a
paper
when
you
can
do
it
later,
when
you
have
a
different
paper
due
sooner?
Tomorrow
is
the
busiest
day
of
the
year
and
all
that
business.
There
is
no
real
way
around
this
hump
that
I
have
discovered
in
my
writing
other
than
constant
vigilance.
Whenever
I
cite
the
above
reasons
to
myself
as
reasons
to
avoid
going
through
the
often
painful
process
of
revision,
a
little
alarm
goes
off
that
I
am
somehow
fooling
myself,
and
I
try
to
push
past
my
doubts
and
worries.
