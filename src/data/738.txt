I
suppose
I
could
say
Ieve
been
a
writer
since
before
I
was
actually
born.
While
this
is
clearly
an
exaggeration,
I
began
my
writing
endeavors
before
I
could
read
or
write
in
the
quintessential
form
of
approved
communication,
that
being
the
English
language.
I
would
depict
the
triumphs
and
tribulations
of
stick
figures
on
post-it
notes,
presenting
my
creations
to
preschool
playmates
and
family.
Eventually,
several
Dr.
Seuss
books
later,
I
grasped
phonetic
understanding
and
began
writing
stories
using
actual
words.
I
vividly
remember
the
first
time
I
used
the
written
language
to
communicate
my
feelings.
I
was
four
years
old,
sitting
at
the
kitchen
table.
vHow
do
you
spell
dlove?eg
I
asked
my
mother,
who
was
busy
preparing
breakfast
before
dropping
me
off
at
St.
Peteres
Preschool.
vL-O-V-E,g
she
responded.
vWhy?g
was
the
natural
follow-up
question.
I
didnet
answer,
for
on
a
yellow
post-it
note
snatched
from
my
fatheres
office,
in
blue
ink,
I
had
scrawled
unabashed
feelings
for
my
preschool
paramour.
vI
love
you,g
was
all
I
had
written.
Obviously,
I
did
not
love
himShchI
was
four.
My
handwriting
was
something
to-be
desired,
and
yet
I
still
entrusted
this
note
to
a
mutual
pal
in
the
hopes
that
she
would
pass
the
message
onto
him.
These
were
the
earliest
means
of
passive
aggressive
communication.
Before
the
days
of
texting,
my
generation
had
post-it
notes,
or
perhaps
I
was
only
the
one
to
take
advantage
of
the
sticky
square
of
multicolored
paper.
I
can
still
recall
the
feeling,
as
I
watched
from
across
the
classroom
in
an
emerald
green
corduroy
dress
(hey,
it
was
1995).
He
read
the
note,
and
laughed!
Not
exactly
the
response
I
was
hoping
for,
so
I
presume,
reflecting
17
years
later,
that
he
did
not
reciprocate
my
feelings.
In
this
scenario,
at
four
years
of
age,
I
learned
a
very
important
lesson.
Sometimes,
it
is
not
in
onees
best
interest
to
allow
them
self
to
be
so
vulnerable,
and
secondly,
the
written
word,
especially
in
terms
of
revealing
onees
feelings,
is
a
pretty
powerful
concept.
My
belief
in
the
written
word
led
me
to
become
a
rather
voracious
reader
during
my
elementary
school
years.
I
read
anything
I
could
get
my
hands
on,
even
an
edition
of
Pride
and
Prejudice
in
which
author
Jane
Austenes
flowery
language
proved
too
tedious
for
even
the
most
determined
of
readers
to
comprehend.
Try
and
try
as
I
did,
Austenes
tale
of
five
English
sisters
was
not
intended
for
an
eight
year-old.
In
doing
all
of
this
reading,
I
naturally
began
writing
intensely
and
regularly,
as
well:
song
lyrics,
journals,
poems,
short
stories,
plays,
anything
and
everything
was
subject
to
inspiration.
Eventually,
I
lured
my
classmates
into
participating
in
my
efforts,
as
well,
staging
original
works
written
by
yours
truly.
Though
the
end
results
often
proved
rather
shaky
(organizing
eight
year-olds
is
no
easy
feat),
the
proof
was
in
the
countless
plays,
written
works
just
short
of
staged
production;
I
loved
writing.
It
was
around
this
time
I
ditched
the
pen
and
paper
in
exchange
for
emerging
software,
the
more
techno-chic
Microsoft
Word.
At
a
massive
nineties-style
Dell
in
my
fatheres
office,
I
would
stay
up
past
my
bedtime,
writing
scripts
and
short
stories.
Some
of
these
creations
debuted
at
family
gatherings,
in
which
Ied
bribe
my
cousins
to
participate
as
characters
in
the
plays
I
had
written.
Most
of
these
pieces,
however,
remained
confined
to
the
virtual
realm,
never
reaching
their
full
potential
via
the
printer.
Nonetheless,
my
many
ventures
into
creative
writing
did
not
go
unnoticed.
I
never
truly
realized
the
weight
of
my
familyes
support
in
my
writing;
family
is
supposed
to
cheer
you
on,
serve
as
onees
biggest
fan.
Today,
however,
I
thank
my
family
for
their
support
and
encouragement,
and
of
course,
for
tolerating
the
countless
run-throughs
and
readings.
My
peers,
too,
were
intrigued
by
my
forays
into
writing.
In
fifth
grade,
I
gained
the
recognition
of
my
classmates
after
a
creative
writing
exposition,
of
sorts.
The
assignment
was
fairly
simple:
write
a
creative
story
about
any
topic
of
choice.
Well,
I
got
pretty
into
writing
my
story,
creating
a
chilling
tale
about
an
elderly
man
in
a
chartreuse
chair
that
ended
up
being
a
lengthy
21
pages.
The
spooky
narrative
gave
the
entire
class
nightmares,
and
while
I
felt
badly
for
the
missing
hours
of
sleep,
I
relished
the
vividness
of
storytelling
and
being
able
to
bring
my
imagination
to
life.
After
this
level
of
exposure,
Ieve
been
editing
the
papers
of
my
peers
since.
While
peer
recognition
was
encouraging,
it
was
the
support
of
my
teachers
that
truly
nurtured
my
growth
as
a
writer.
I
stand
firm
by
the
clichd
statement
that
a
special
educator
can
really
make
a
difference
in
a
studentes
life;
I
was
lucky
to
encounter
several
special
teachers
in
my
lifetime.
From
Mrs.
Buonomo,
my
fifth
and
sixth
grade
English
teacher,
to
my
wonderful
high
school
mentor
and
chair
of
the
English
department,
Mrs.
Marcus,
amazing
teachers
have
both
promoted
my
passion
for
writing
and
helped
in
honing
this
craft
and
ultimately
leading
me
to
consider
writing
as
a
profession
and
livelihood.
It
was
Mrs.
Marcus
who
in
fact
helped
me
find
a
life-changing
internship
the
summer
before
my
senior
year
of
high
school.
I
was
given
the
opportunity
to
assist
at
a
boutique
literary
agency
and
publishing
consulting
company.
A
liaison
between
writer
and
publisher,
my
internship
at
Joelle
Delbourgo
Associates
shed
light
on
a
side
of
the
industry
many
people
fail
to
consider,
and
also
forged
lifelong
relationships
and
invaluable
experiences.
At
Delbourgo
Associates,
I
was
entrusted
with
reading
through
submission
letters
and
deciding
the
fate
of
many
hopeful
authors
based
on
these
submissions.
This
level
of
responsibility
helped
me
pinpoint
important
aspects
of
writing,
and
also
differentiate
between,
succinctly
put,
the
good
and
the
bad.
Despite
the
generally
positive
praise
for
my
writing,
my
writing
experiences
were
not
without
any
speed
bumps.
My
junior
year
of
high
school,
a
teacher
challenged
my
writing
style,
demanding
a
more
serious
tone
to
my
creatively
driven
method.
The
class
was
AP
United
States
History,
and
although
I
had
been
accustomed
to
writing
thesis-driven
essays,
it
was
the
first
time
a
teacher
had
demanded
I
really
prove
my
thesis
with
examples,
and
lots
of
them.
Thorough
research
and
multiple
edits
to
every
paper
there
afterward
were
a
requisite
to
success.
The
hard
work
paid
off,
as
I
also
took
a
moment
to
reevaluate
my
writing
methods
and
tailor
these
different
styles
to
varying
purposes.
For
instance,
the
way
in
which
one
might
compose
an
English
essay
is
not
the
same
way
one
might
write
a
Politics
paper.
Part
of
the
writing
process
is
embracing
the
learning
experience,
and
with
the
right
attitude,
criticism
can
be
a
helpful
guide.
All
this
being
said,
I
felt
very
prepared
to
tackle
Lafayettees
rigorous
curriculum.
In
meeting
with
a
professor
during
my
freshman
year
to
discuss
a
midterm
paper,
he
was
pleased
to
find
that
I
indeed
knew
what
a
thesis
was,
and
how
to
construct
one.
I
was
shocked
when
he
told
me
that
students
in
my
class
had
never
even
heard
the
word,
nor
knew
anything
of
the
concept
and
its
importance
in
composing
a
paper.
The
conversation
cemented
my
belief
in
the
strength
of
my
high
school
writing
program
and
in
preparing
me
for
college.
Nonetheless,
similar
issues
with
providing
concrete
examples
rooted
in
explanations
haunted
me
again
in
a
class
during
my
freshman
spring.
A
professor
asked
that
I
prove
myself
in
a
more
thorough
manner;
while
he
praised
my
writing
stylistically,
in
red
ink
on
every
page
were
clear
directions
to
provide
more
examples.
I
felt
frustrated
when
a
friend
earned
a
better
grade
on
the
assignment
than
I
did,
because
she
provided
more
examples
and
in
turn,
supported
them.
I
realized,
however,
that
frustration
would
not
get
me
anywhere,
and
the
sole
mechanism
of
redemption
was
my
own
determination
and
competitiveness
with
myself
to
achieve
my
personal
best.
I
reflected
back
to
my
days
in
AP
United
States
History,
and
again
reassessed
my
technique
as
a
writer.
The
next
assigned
paper,
I
made
sure
to
provide
valid
proof
and
support
every
claim
made
in
arguing
my
thesis.
While
I
despised
writing
outlines
in
high
school,
I
found
that
they
were
in
fact
an
organized
way
to
plan
writing.
I
liken
an
outline
to
the
blueprint
of
a
house;
it
is
essentially
the
foundation
of
the
final
draft.
In
response
to
these
experiences,
I
now
utilize
outlines
before
writing
all
papers,
and
the
previous
writing
issues
have
not
arisen
since.
This
being
said,
despite
feeling
prepared
to
write
on
a
college
level,
I
am
still
very
much
a
learner.
As
a
student,
and
more
specifically,
a
student
writer,
it
is
important
to
admit
there
is
always
room
for
growth
and
improvement.
One
of
the
aspects
I
am
most
excited
about
in
serving
as
a
Writing
Associate
is
sharing
my
own
experiences
with
students.
Although
I
love
to
write
and
take
much
pride
in
doing
so,
I
have
certainly
had
my
fair
share
of
frustrations
when
writing
papers.
I
want
students
to
know
that
once
these
frustrations
are
conquered,
not
only
is
a
lesson
learned,
but
also
more
experience
is
gained,
thus
ensuring
a
smoother
writing
process
in
the
future.
After
a
plethora
of
roadblocks
in
my
own
writing
career,
I
was
pleased
to
earn
a
writing-intensive
internship
this
summer,
composing
freelance
articles
several
times
a
week
for
emcBlue.com.
The
experience
was
sweetened
when
my
pieces
were
published,
garnering
headline
status
on
the
main
page
of
the
website.
In
taking
my
passion
for
writing
outside
of
academia
and
into
a
professional
environment,
I
learned
to
alter
pieces
for
a
particular
audience.
While
the
notion
of
a
thesis
and
maintaining
my
voice
as
an
author
remained
present
throughout
my
internship,
I
kept
in
mind
the
content
of
the
pieces
and
the
desired
audience
when
writing,
as
well.
Though
I
was
not
writing
lengthy
papers
on
academic
subject
material,
the
general
concepts
of
writing
etiquette
drummed
through
my
mind,
and
ultimately,
I
believe,
assisted
in
maximizing
my
success
and
positive
experiences
at
my
internship
this
summer.
From
the
prehistoric
means
of
post-it
note
communication
to
my
Mac
nestled
in
a
cubby
on
the
second
floor
on
Skillman,
writing
has
been
an
integral
part
of
my
life.
The
unsightly
bump
on
my
right
ring
finger,
made
apparent
by
long
periods
of
manual
writing,
used
to
cause
embarrassment.
Nowadays,
I
am
proud
to
have
attained
a
vwriteres
finger,g
as
it
was
dubbed
by
Mrs.
Marcus,
for
it
identifies
my
passion
as
a
writer
in
the
past,
present,
and
future.
