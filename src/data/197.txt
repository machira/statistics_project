Treading
in
Landless
Sea
A
BOY'S
IMPROBABLE
JOURNEY
TO
WRITERHOOD
by
Department
of
English
Professor

Falbo
27
August
1999
I
was
treading
in
a
vast
sea
of
clear,
creative
thought.
There
was
no
land
in
sight.
Not
even
a
buoy
could
be
found.
I
soon
faced
the
possibility
of
drowning
in
my
own
imagination.
I
always
envisioned
a
noble
departure
from
this
earth.
Not
this!
How
pathetic!
It
was
at
this
moment
of
utter
despair
that
I
realized
my
fate.
I
needed
to
write.
I
needed
to
write
like
I've
never
written
before.
The
realization
gave
me
an
unmistakable
feeling
of
rejuvenation.
Allow
me
to
tell
you
how
I
stand
where
I'm
standing.
Here's
my
story.
PREFACE
Every
teacher
in
my
scholastic
career,
from
Mrs.
Feldherr
in
first
grade
to
Sister
Nora
in
eleventh,
stressed
that
reading
made
the
writer.
In
my
early
days
I
indifferently
shrugged
off
this
shrewd
advice.
As
maturity
and
logic
gained
a
tighter
grasp
on
my
way
of
thinking,
however,
I
came
to
appreciate
what
they
had
been
pounding
into
us
all
those
years.
And
so
I
read.
Granted,
I
staunchly
refused
to
sacrifice
'play
time'
and
give
up
quality
recreation
to
read
books.
But
gradually
I
made
it
a
point
to
delegate
priority
status
to
the
act
of
reading.
Reading,
perhaps
second
only
to
movies,
has
paid
off
in
greater
dividends
than
any
other
medium
in
my
life.
It
has
provided,
in
immeasurable
amount,
personality,
entertainment,
and
the
will
to
write.
Indeed
reading
makes
the
writer!
The
pivotal
role
reading
has
played
in
my
development
as
a
writer
will
be
included
with
frequency
in
this
story.
If
it
seems
I
overindulge,
it
is
only
because
I
view7
reading
and
writing
as
one
in
the
same.
They
are
symbiotically
engaged
in
a
perpetual
relationship
with
no
hope
or
reason
to
be
otherwise.
Poetry,
if
you
will.
CHAPTER
1
I
think
it
all
started
with
a
crayon.
You
know,
one
of
those
jumbo
monsters
that
I
could
barely
get
my
fledgling
fingers
around.
At
this
point,
it
wasn't
the
content
of
my
written
word
that
made
the
difference;
it
was
the
act,
the
physical
motion
that
laid
down
the
first
bricks.
We,
my
pre-school
classmates
and
I,
embarked
on
our
journeys
by
signing
our
drawings
with
our
first
name.
It
may
be
noted
that
there
was
very
little
aesthetic
value
to
the
piece
save
its
simplicity.
While
we
didn't
fully
understand
what
was
going
on
(our
teacher
was
the
driving
force),
it
was
clear
that
writing
had
stitched
its
place
in
all
of
our
lives.
The
few
years
that
followed
were,
for
the
most
part,
uneventful.
I
recall
vividly
being
a
member
of
the
remedial
reading
group
in
first
through
fourth
grade.
My
comprehension
and
analytical
skills
were
dull
and
required
extra
attention.
Nowadays
I
look
at
this
circumstance
not
as
a
setback
or
weakness,
but
as
a
blessing
in
disguise.
Perhaps
it
gave
me
the
needed
incentive
to
strive
for
progress.
Maybe
it
sharpened
my
abilities
even
further
than
my
peers
in
the
advanced
groups.
Whatever
the
result,
it's
a
piece
of
the
puzzle.
Fourth
grade
marked
the
year
of
book
reports.
There
was
some
form
of
contest
wherein
my
class
competed
to
write
as
many
book
reports
as
we
could
in
a
given
amount
of
time.
I
think
it
was
sponsored
by
Pizza
Hut.
Anyway,
before
I
continue,
I
think
I
should
outline
what
was
expected:
get
a
book
approved
by
the
teacher,
read
it,
and
summarize
it.
The
competition
was
fierce.
There
were
elbows
and
bloodshed
abound.
I
performed
with
stunning
mediocrity
but
learned
an
invaluable
lesson
in
writing:
Don't
plagiarize!
Yes
sir,
I
was
caught
red-handed.
I
flimsily
attempted
to
take
what
someone
else
had
put
on
the
back
of
the
book
and
make
it
look
like
it
was
mine.
Originality
now
held
a
significant
meaning.
In
the
midst
of
the
Gulf
War,
my
teacher
Mrs.
Mancuso
had
us
write
about
Saddam
Hussein,
Iraq's
aggressive
behavior,
and
our
general
feeling
toward
war.
As
far
back
as
I
can
remember,
this
was
the
first
writing
assignment
that
was
completely
based
on
my
individual
opinion.
Frankly,
it
was
daunting.
If
she
made
me
read
this
in
front
of
the
class,
what
would
everyone
think?
"They'd
laugh,
for
sure,"
I
naively
thought.
It
was
a
battle
against
conformity.
A
raging
brawl
with
self-consciousness.
Good
versus
Evil.
I
think
I
ended
up
giving
in.
I
wrote
something
really
conservative,
something
that
built
a
wall
around
me
protecting
me
from
hurled
tomatoes,
demeaning
words,
rocks,
and
other
sharp
objects.
I
have
since
changed.
The
wall
I
erected
came
down
with
Berlin.
CHAPTER
2
Seventh
through
tenth
grade
brought
entirely
new
aspects
to
the
table.
I
was
introduced
to
classic
literature,
formal
essay
writing,
and
what
later
became
known
to
me
as
a
desire
to
write.
At
some
point
during
this
period
I
found
out
that
it
was
OK
to
write
on
my
own,
abandoning
the
imperious
encouragement
of
school.
Writing
can
be
fun,
and
just
might
require
some
free
time
in
order
to
be
properly
nourished.
It
was
the
seventh
grade
when
my
English
teacher
Mr.
Hendrickson
was
gallant
enough
to
have
us
write
an
autobiography.
I
reveled
in
the
opportunity
to
reach
back
into
my
past
and
explain
who
I
had
become.
As
I
w?orked
on
the
project,
however,
it
appeared
that
I
was
somewhat
hasty
in
my
reaction
to
the
assignment.
This
called
for
more
than
the
usual
fluff
I
spewed
out
in
elementary
school.
I
used
this
insight
to
my
advantage
and
went
a
step
beyond
the
crowd.
Receiving
an
'A'
on
that
paper
w7as
meaningful
to
me;
it
marked
the
beginning
of
something.
Simultaneously,
I
grew
ever
so
close
to
the
pinnacle
of
leadership:
correspondent
of
a
three-man
social
studies
group.
It
was
a
role
that
landed
in
my
lap
without
forewarning,
but
I
accepted
the
challenge
with
headstrong
ambition.
My
confidence
escalated
as
I
prepared
in-class
essays
and
my
group's
consensus
to
various
baffling
questions.
Writing
now
became
my
ticket
to
politics.
Eighth
grade
is
noteworthy
only
because
Shakespeare
and
other
well-established
authors
came
into
the
picture.
I
tasted
a
fine
sample
of
what
my
predecessors
had
been
busy
with
in
the
past.
I
was
just
as
astonished
as
their
closest
disciples.
Ninth
and
tenth
grade
were
most
important
in
reinforcing
the
basic
outline
of
a
formal
essay:
introduction,
body,
conclusion.
Through
no
other
means
than
frequent
practice
did
this
art
become
a
common,
efficient
form
of
writing.
Global
studies
transformed
essay
writing
into
a
routine
more
familiar
than
writing
my
name.
I
was
also
further
exposed
to
the
genre
of
poetry
and
the
benefits
of
journal
writing.
Reading
a
diversified
bank
of
poetry
was
particularly
influential
to
my
recent
writing
penchant.
Before,
it
was
an
absurdity
for
me
to
think
about
writing
poetry'.
After,
I
had
no
inhibitions
whatsoever.
CHAPTERS
I
have
devoted
this
chapter
alone
to
my
developments
in
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
grade.
It
also
covers
the
advent
of
the
personal
computer
in
my
life.
Together
they
have
forged
the
greatest
attack
on
my
illiteracy.
The
SAT
w'asn't
just
a
fleeting
exam
for
me.
For
a
considerable
time,
it
was
a
religious
obsession.
I
didn't
enroll
in
a
course
or
anything,
but
I
made
it
a
personal
test
to
see
how
well
I
could
prepare.
I
did
substantial
work
in
vocabulary
and
reading
comprehension.
The
work
has
enhanced
my
writing
skills
to
the
point
where
I
almost
wish
there
was
more
of
its
kind.
The
vocabulary
element
to
the
exam
further
stimulated
Now
to
the
computer.
I
recall
using
a
typewriter
to
do
some
papers
in
middle
school
and
the
beginning
of
high
school.
I
even
used
a
word
processor
for
a
month
or
two.
Once
that
first
modem
PC
arrived
on
my
doorstep,
everything
else
was
for
the
birds.
I,
myself,
can't
explain
why
it's
such
an
inviting
piece
of
machinery.
Who
could've
predicted
that
some
of
the
most
inspiring
writing
would
stem
from
people
who
dropped
their
pen
and
jabbed
their
fingers
at
a
keyboard?
I
don't
know
what
would
happen
if
the
millenium
bug
handicaps
my
access
to
a
computer.
It's
dreary
to
think
another
Dark
Age
might
fall
upon
us.
CHAPTER
4
If
there's
one
thing
that
placates
my
parents
about
their
decision
to
send
me
to
private
school,
it's
that
I
was
sufficiently
prepared
to
take
on
the
rigors
of
college
writing.
And
so,
it
was
with
this
comforting
thought,
that
I
enrolled
in
my
first
year
seminar.
There
were
some
comers
that
my
carpet
didn't
reach.
I
admit
that
up
front.
Nevertheless,
I
maintained
exemplary
reading
habits
and
followed
the
writing
assignments
with
a
watchful
eye.
Not
long
into
our
first
assignment
my
rough
draft
was
set
aside
by
the
professor
to
be
commended
for
its
adherence
to
a
workable
thesis
statement.
As
far
as
I'm
concerned,
that
will
probably
remain
one
of
my
most
exalted
moments
as
a
human
being
on
this
planet.
Where
am
I
now?
Well,
I'm
still
writing.
A
recent
revelation
has
uncovered
my
desire
to
tackle
not
one
specific
area
of
writing,
but
to
instead
pursue
a
wide
variety
of
genres.
For
example,
I
am
currently
most
intrigued
in
writing
short,
satirical
essays
describing
my
observations
of
real
experiences.
my
interest
in
the
language
as
a
whole.
To
this
day
I
attribute
my
insatiable
hunger
for
words
to
the
SAT.
College
admission
essays
inevitably
infiltrated
my
hard
drive
space
with
supreme
prospect.
With
the
help
and
guidance
of
my
father
I
constructed
about
ten
of
the
aforementioned.
They
were
each
singularly
different
as
the
questions
belonged
to
a
broad
spectrum
of
subjects.
My
father
was
more
than
content
with
my
efforts
as
were
the
schools
I
enthusiastically
sent
them
to.
The
extraordinary
part,
however,
was
the
promptness
and
fervor
with
which
I
undertook
the
task.
I
looked
forward
to
delving
into
the
next
story
just
as
much
as
reviewing
the
finished
product.
My
junior
and
senior
year
writing/English
courses
were
without
comparison
in
their
preparatory
exercises.
I
finally
came
to
fully
understand
the
concept
behind
critically
analyzing
literature
and
carefully
pulling
a
thesis
from
intricate
pieces.
Research
papers
no
longer
required
the
teacher's
assistance
in
collecting
appropriate
data
from
reliable
sources.
Literary
devices
like
symbolism
and
alliteration
were
easily
tracked
by
my
heightened
awareness.
Proofreading
and
accepting
constructive
criticism
became
tolerable
endeavors.
I
also
began
to
appreciate
writers
(Hemingway,
Faulkner,
etc.)
for
their
uncanny
ability
to
weave
a
story.
Due
to
a
class
study
of
various
Hawthorne
works,
I
now
avidly
read
his
most
cherished
creations.
It
seemed
my
mentors
knew
exactly
what
we
were
to
face
in
the
future.
I
think
it
was
the
summer
preceding
senior
year
when
I
started
contributing
to
a
teen
literary
newspaper.
I
mainly
wrote
poetry,
but
I
also
submitted
letters
to
the
editor,
film
critiques,
and
a
couple
of
short
stories.
For
several
reasons,
all
of
my
stuff
was
published.
The
newspaper
isn't
the
most
reputable
source
for
literature
in
the
country,
but
it
gave
me
an
enthralling
feeling
that
somebody
out
there
was
actually
reading
what
I
had
printed.
CHAPTER
5
Reactions
to
my
writing
have
been
more
than
fulfilling.
Two
instances
stand
out
in
my
mind.
A
few
months
ago
I
wrote
a
brief
letter
of
appreciation
to
a
professor
that
highly
recommended
me
for
a
program.
Shortly
after,
a
graded
test
was
returned
with
a
note
from
the
professor
on
the
bottom.
I
was
praised
as
an
"excellent
writer."
I
subsequently
concluded
that
if
I
could
impress
someone
with
a
thank-you
letter,
I
must
be
doing
something
right.
Senior
year
of
high
school
I
chose
public
speech
as
an
elective
course.
One
of
our
first
assignments
was
to
write
a
concise
story
about
a
time
in
our
life
when
we
experienced
our
worst
fears.
After
reading
mine
aloud
to
the
class,
my
teacher
commented
on
my
clever
word
selection
and
skillful
flow.
I
realized
that
I
had
applied
all
that
was
taught
to
me
to
a
non-traditional
setting
for
writing.
This
wasn't
a
research
paper.
I
wasn't
exploring
a
new
realm
with
poetry.
I
related
a
unique
experience
to
an
audience
with
words
I
selected
to
be
structured
in
sentences,
organized
into
paragraphs.
What
a
beautiful
thing!
EPILOGUE
Certainly
my
writing
has
come
a
long
way
since
I
first
signed
my
name.
It
has
transcended
simple
school
assignments
and
frivolous
e-mails
between
friends.
The
miraculous
part
about
the
whole
thing
is
that
writing
seems
to
gain
momentum
as
each
piece
of
the
puzzle
is
affixed.
That
is,
with
every
completed
letter
or
essay
or
thesis
paper,
I
am
a
better
writer.
With
every
completed
book
and
magazine
or
newspaper
article,
I
am
a
better
writer.
The
incentive
to
read
and
write
with
passion
has
never
been
more
enticing.
In
retrospect,
I
can
still
find
a
great
deal
of
things
I
could
have
done
to
improve
on
my
writing
skills.
My
history
undoubtedly
has
voids
that
others
do
not
possess.
The
future,
however,
holds
undeniable
promise.
I
will
continue
reading
and
writing
until
the
voids
are
cemented
shut
with
pure,
unadulterated
literacy.
That's
all
folks!
