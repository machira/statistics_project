Writing
the
University:
One
Discipline
at
a
Time
It
is
shocking
to
think
that
I
have
been
at
Lafayette
College
for
three
years
now,
and
that
I
have
been
a
Writing
Associate
for
two
of
those
years.
I
hope
of
course
that
my
writing
has
greatly
improved;
that
all
of
those
common
mistakes
and
writing
weaknesses
I
wrote
about
two
years
ago
have
disappeared
or
diminished.
I
have
not
yet
overused
dashes
or
parenthesis
or
scattered
comas
or
written
any
paragraph
long
sentences,
so
perhaps
things
really
have
changed
over
the
past
three
years.
One
can
certainly
hope.
If
nothing
else
however
this
past
year
of
writing
has
given
me
a
great
deal
of
exposure
to
different
types
of
writing.
I
took
few
English
classes,
and
so
I
was
forced
to
think
about
and
learn
how
to
write
in
other
disciplines
and
in
forms
common
to
those
disciplines.
Over
the
past
year
I
also
continued
to
wrestle
with
what
it
means
for
me
to
twrite
as
a
WA.u
And
of
course
I
was
a
WA
for
two
classes,
continuing
to
enjoy
working
with
first
year
writers.
Also
during
the
second
semester
I
expanded
from
working
with
different
types
of
writing
for
my
own
classes
to
WAing
a
different
type
of
writing
with
upper
class
students.
Overall
it
was
a
year
spent
realizing
that
writing
exists
outside
of
the
English
discipline,
and
in
a
myriad
of
forms
and
styles.
Last
fall
two
of
the
classes
I
was
taking
forced
me
to
write
as
I
had
never
written
before.
The
first
was
a
Gov/Law
class,
rGender
and
the
Law,s
which
I
thoroughly
enjoyed,
actually
to
the
point
where
I
decided
to
seriously
consider
law
school
and
the
legal
profession.
Although
I
obviously
warmed
to
the
subject,
at
first
I
was
completely
thrown
by
the
concept
of
a
tlegal
brief.u
Writing
in
the
legal
field
is
highly
regimented,
everything
is
written
in
what
is
considered
the
most
useful
manner.
I
certainly
would
not
say
that
English
papers
are
completely
free
formiaany
paper
without
an
organizational
structure
will
generally
be
unwelcome
in
any
discipline.
However,
I
was
very
used
to
taking
a
paragraph
from
a
novel
and
writing
about
it
for
four
or
five
pages,
going
deeply
into
its
potential
meanings
and
implications
for
the
rest
of
the
work.
To
be
told
to
take
a
complex
and
lengthy
document
and
reduce
it
to
less
than
a
page
was
quite
uncomfortable
at
first.
English
had
taught
me
to
take
something
small
and
be
able
to
talk
about
it
ad
nauseam
(a
slightly
unfair
characterization),
and
here
I
was
being
asked
by
a
professor
to
do
just
the
opposite.
I
will
not
say
that
writing
concisely
is
exactly
one
of
my
strengths,
but
with
continued
practice
I
was
able
to
get
fairly
good
at
writing
briefs
that
were
within
the
guidelines
of
the
discipline.
Another
class
I
took
that
semester
challenged
me
in
an
entirely
different
way,
forcing
me
to
write
about
art.
The
class
was
actually
in
the
American
Studies
discipline,
my
first
major,
and
so
I
was
not
expecting
anything
out
of
the
ordinary.
To
my
chagrin,
but
also
likely
my
benefit,
the
professor
did
an
excellent
job
of
really
making
the
class
multi-disciplinary.
I
have
written
about
film
in
the
past
and
always
found
that
incredibly
challengingiafirst
of
all
it
is
not
like
a
book
where
you
can
write
the
paper
with
paragraph
three
on
page
fifty-two
staring
you
right
in
the
face,
and
then
of
course
there
are
levels
and
sublevels
in
film,
something
needs
to
be
said
about
the
sounds
and
cinematography,
not
just
the
dialogueiabut
I
had
never
written
a
paper
based
on
a
painting
before.
I
found
the
experience
similar
to
my
transition
from
writing
about
books
to
writing
about
films,
some
of
the
skills
were
transferable,
but
I
always
had
to
keep
in
mind
the
differences
between
the
two
mediums.
There
are
obviously
things
that
a
book
can
do
that
a
painting
cannot,
and
vice
versa.
I
did
not
enjoy
this
experience
nearly
as
much
as
I
enjoyed
my
work
with
briefs,
because
I
still
found
myself
struggling
to
be
certain
that
what
I
was
saying
about
the
painting
could
be
substantiated.
Due
to
the
continued
difficulty
I
would
not
exactly
say
I
enjoyed
this
foray
into
writing
about
paintings,
but
I
did
enjoy
having
the
opportunity
to
try
new
types
of
writing.
This
past
spring
semester
two
more
of
my
classes
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
write
in
new
ways,
although
in
contrast
to
my
two
experiences
in
the
fall
semester
I
did
not
find
the
transition
as
difficult
or
as
stimulatingiaas
in
the
case
of
the
briefs
leading
me
to
work
toward
a
career
in
law.
In
rPolitical
Parties
and
Electionss
our
semester
long
project
was
to
take
notes
a
few
times
a
week
on
a
website
or
media
outlet
of
some
sort
related
to
the
Presidential
election
using
a
coding
sheet.
With
our
coding
sheet
we
could
keep
track
of
things
like,
number
of
times
women
voters
were
referenced
on
the
main
page,
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
semester
create
our
own
statistics
using
those
numbers.
I
followed
Hillary
Clintonus
website,
and
made
an
incredibly
elaborate
coding
sheet
which
I
filled
out
at
least
twice
a
week.
I
am
generally
a
dismal
failure
when
things
turn
mathematical,
but
I
was
able
to
create
some
fairly
simple
percentage
statistics
and
make
verifiable
statements
about
the
frequency
of
certain
topics
on
her
site,
which
did
suggest
some
interesting
things
about
her
campaign.
The
paper
that
came
from
this
research
was
certainly
nothing
like
anything
I
have
ever
written
before
as
I
have
never
before
had
a
topic
where
it
made
sense
to
craft
and
incorporate
my
own
statistical
data
on
the
subject.
Despite
my
math
anxiety
I
found
the
paper
fairly
easy
to
write,
although
a
bit
frustrating
because
there
was
so
little
room
in
the
paper
for
real
detailed
analysis
with
the
statistics
taking
up
space.
I
doubt
I
will
ever
write
such
a
paper
again,
but
I
did
feel
like
I
was
getting
an
excellent
liberal
arts
education
as
I
worked
with
this
new
type
of
writing.
The
final
new
type
of
writing
was
the
least
different
from
my
typical
English
class
sort
of
papers,
History
writing.
The
professor
did
put
an
interesting
spin
on
the
assignment
that
I
sure
made
it
a
new
experience
for
most;
we
were
writing
about
the
ideals
of
the
revolution
using
only
our
textbook
and
newspaper
articles
of
the
time.
The
textbook
gave
the
definitions
of
the
ideals
reflecting
what
historians
have
decided
over
the
years,
but
until
recently
most
historians
did
not
have
access
to
this
many
newspaper
articles.
The
recent
digitization
of
the
articles
made
it
possible
for
our
class
of
mere
undergrads
to
take
on
the
task
of
comparing
the
articles
with
the
textbook
and
considering
if
the
historians
were
really
correct
in
their
definitions
of
concepts
like
liberty,
equality,
sovereignty,
and
interest.
I
had
never
written
a
paper
quite
like
this
one,
using
primary
sources
to
evaluate
secondary
sources
written
by
historians
who
have
had
their
PhDs
longer
than
I
have
been
alive,
but
thanks
to
a
class
I
took
my
sophomore
year
I
was
already
quite
comfortable
using
the
newspaper
database
and
researching
and
using
primary
sources
in
papers.
Of
course
those
were
English
papers,
but
the
skills
still
transferred.
Writing
the
paper
making
sure
to
keep
the
focus
on
the
history,
and
not
just
delving
into
word-by-word
analysis
of
the
primary
source
was
slightly
difficult.
Also
writing
Chicago
style
rather
than
MLA
took
a
bit
of
time
to
adjust
to,
although
I
would
actually
say
that
after
having
used
both
I
find
Chicago
much
more
convenient.
There
is
no
need
to
construct
a
works
cited
page
at
the
end,
and
all
of
the
references
are
right
there
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
making
it
easy
for
the
writer
to
keep
track
of
what
s/he
is
doing,
and
easy
for
the
reader
to
look
up
a
source
if
necessary.
All
of
these
varied
writing
experiences
combined
to
make
it
a
year
of
exploration.
I
discovered
new
things
about
myself,
about
disciplines,
and
about
how
to
adapt
writing
skills
and
styles.
While
I
was
learning
all
these
new
writing
styles
and
forms
within
disciplines
I
was
also
a
WA.
And
writing
as
WA
takes
a
certain
amount
of
getting
used
to
as
well.
I
have
always
been
a
fairly
good
writer,
able
to
bang
out
a
paper
in
a
matter
of
hours
if
necessary.
Being
a
WA
and
reviewing
the
writing
process
with
first
year
writers
always
causes
me
to
recall
the
process
to
my
own
writing.
I
obviously
feel
the
need
to
practice
what
I
preach,
and
there
was
at
first
some
discomfort
in
reintroducing
practices
I
had
dropped.
And
of
course
I
still
do
not
write
as
carefully
as
I
should,
still
knowing
that
I
am
a
decent
writer
without
putting
in
much
time.
Although
I
do
think,
and
I
have
heard
many
other
WAs
say
this
as
well,
being
a
WA
helps
you
improve
your
own
writing.
Even
if
I
do
not
painstakingly
read
through
my
papers
as
though
I
am
both
student
and
WA,
the
questions
are
still
there
in
my
headiatWhy
did
I
decide
to
put
this
paragraph
here?u
or
tWhat
is
it
that
Ium
trying
to
get
across
with
this
sentence?u
Perhaps
the
more
difficult
component
to
writing
as
a
WA
is
that
all
of
your
professors
know
that
you
are
a
WA
and
it
raises
their
expectations.
I
had
one
small
English
class
this
past
year
where
the
professor
knew
I
was
a
WA
and
not
only
did
he
talk
up
the
program
as
being
a
great
place
to
get
another
set
of
eyes
on
your
paper,
but
he
specifically
suggested
to
the
class
that
I
was
a
WA
and
in
a
great
position
to
be
useful
to
them
as
I
knew
both
how
to
WA
papers
in
general
and
the
material
of
the
class
specifically.
But
no
pressure
or
anythingi
And
of
course
when
the
professor
knows
that
you
are
a
WA
and
you
do
not
do
well
on
a
paper
that
may
be
the
most
difficult
writing
experience.
First
of
all
most,
maybe
all,
WAs
know
that
they
are
good
writers
and
expect
excellent
grades
on
their
writing
and
so
to
get
a
B+
even
is
a
terribly
humbling
and
humiliating
experience.
I
am
no
exception
to
this
rule,
and
the
most
difficult
class
I
took
over
the
school
year
involved
writing
papers
of
the
sort
I
was
used
toiaresponses
to
booksiabut
I
just
could
not
get
the
A.
And
of
course
the
professor
knew
that
I
was
a
WA,
which
made
the
experience
all
the
worse.
I
finally
did
get
the
hang
of
exactly
what
it
was
he
was
looking
for,
but
not
before
severely
bruising
my
WA
ego.
Moving
from
my
own
writing
into
my
WA
work,
I
had
the
joy
of
having
two
interesting
classes
full
of
great
students.
I
always
enjoy
working
with
first
year
writers
because
it
is
so
easy
to
help
them.
Also
for
most
of
these
writers
it
would
just
never
occur
to
them
not
to
come
to
their
WA
conference.
And
while
they
do
not
necessarily
come
prepared,
especially
at
first
when
they
still
are
not
quite
sure
what
exactly
a
WA
does,
there
is
always
plenty
to
discuss
as
they
become
accustomed
to
writing
at
the
college
level.
This
past
fall
I
worked
with
the
FYS
on
Asian
Immigration,
not
a
topic
I
would
ever
have
chosen
to
take
a
class
on
myself,
but
it
turned
out
to
be
fascinating
material.
I
actually
watched
some
of
the
films
and
read
one
of
the
books
just
because
they
sounded
so
interesting
from
the
student
papers
and
from
the
studentus
descriptions.
And
the
professor
was
organized
and
very
positive
about
using
the
WA
program,
which
always
makes
things
so
much
easier.
The
only
difficulty
with
the
class
was
that
there
was
one
student
for
whom
English
was
not
his
first
language
and
he
was
still
struggling
with
it.
It
was
challenging
for
me
to
help
him,
often
not
knowing
myself
exactly
why
things
are
written
in
a
certain
way,
just
knowing
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong.
I
did
get
him
to
go
to
a
writing
tutor
a
few
times,
but
I
doubt
they
are
much
more
equipped
to
handle
ESL
students.
I
realize
few
Lafayette
students
fall
into
this
category,
but
it
still
seems
like
a
real
gap
in
filling
the
needs
of
the
students.
With
that
one
difficulty
put
to
the
side,
it
was
an
enjoyable
semester,
as
I
always
find
it
to
be
when
working
with
an
FYS.
My
most
recent
WA
work
relates
more
to
my
own
experiences
over
the
course
of
the
year
writing
in
new
ways.
The
class
was
entirely
upper
class
students,
one
or
two
sophomores
and
the
rest
juniors
and
seniors,
and
so
consequently
they
knew
how
to
write.
Their
assignment
however
was
still
a
challenging
one,
and
despite
their
writing
proficiency
the
class
was
my
favorite
WA
assignment
of
my
two
years.
The
class
was
on
Folklore,
and
the
students
were
charged
with
the
task
of
finding
twenty
pieces
of
folklore
and
writing
short
papers
about
each
in
the
appropriate
format.
Only
one
student
in
the
class
was
familiar
with
the
format,
and
until
I
asked
the
professor
for
examples
of
good
papers
and
read
through
them,
I
had
never
read
anything
in
this
particular
A&S
format.
And
yet
by
the
end
all
of
them
were
masters,
hitting
all
the
essential
points
in
the
right
places.
I
hope
that
learning
a
new
kind
of
writing
was
as
enjoyable
for
them
as
it
was
for
me
in
all
my
classes
this
past
year,
but
beyond
hoping
I
know
I
enjoyed
reading
their
papers
tremendously.
Never
twenty-five
copies
of
the
same
thing,
always
vastly
different
pieces
of
folklore,
although
when
two
or
three
of
them
were
working
on
the
same
thing
I
was
able
to
let
them
know
so
they
could
share
books
for
annotation
of
their
piece
of
folklore.
One
of
the
challenges
of
the
class
was
the
sheer
volume
of
papers
I
had
to
read,
each
time
we
meet
we
discussed
between
3
and
5
of
their
short
papers,
but
each
paper
was
so
interesting
making
time
was
not
an
unpleasant
task.
And
because
they
were
all
already
proficient
writers
almost
every
conference
centered
around
HOCS
and
not
LOCS,
as
some
conferences
will
with
first
year
writers
who
may
really
need
to
just
talk
about
the
difference
between
first,
second,
and
third
person.
I
fervently
hope
that
I
have
the
opportunity
to
WA
this
class
again.
I
would
love
it
to
be
the
last
class
I
WA,
and
I
am
certain
that
I
would
have
another
semester
full
of
interesting
papers
and
high
level
WA
conferences.
For
my
WA
students
and
myself
I
would
say
this
past
year
was
characterized
by
new
kinds
of
writing.
The
first
year
students
delved
into
writing
at
the
college
level,
the
upper
class
students
and
I
were
forced
to
adapt
our
writing
skills
to
serve
us
in
writing
in
disciplines
with
different
styles
and
formats
than
those
we
were
used
to.
I
loved
both
the
classes
I
had
the
privilege
of
WAing
for,
and
I
mostly
enjoyed
exploring
new
writing
forms.
Even
those
experiences
I
found
less
satisfying
still
broadened
my
experience
as
a
writer,
which
is
never
a
bad
thing.
