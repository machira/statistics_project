I
have
no
memory
of
learning
how
to
write.
I
know
that
I
learned
to
read
when
I
was
about
two
and
a
half
years
old,
and
proceeded
to
read
anything
and
everything
that
I
was
handed,
even
memorizing
the
back
of
a
cereal
box
after
having
read
it
so
many
times
during
breakfast.
The
first
distinct
memory
I
have
of
writing
is
being
told
off
for
holding
a
pencil
wrong.
Apparently,
the
method
I
used
to
write
would
cause
a
lump
to
rise
on
my
fingers.
Although
the
way
I
was
writing
wasnOt
causing
me
any
pain,
I
changed
methods
because
I
felt
I
might
as
well
appease
the
teacher.
Quite
early
in
my
school
years,
I
also
remember
having
an
argument
with
a
girl
called
Anna
about
the
proper
way
to
write
an
NaO.
Anna
insisted
that
it
must
be
done
in
the
way
it
appears
in
Times
New
Roman
font,
while
I
had
been
taught
that
there
was
no
need
to
make
the
stroke
over
the
top.
Anna
informed
me
that
I
wouldnOt
be
allowed
to
write
that
way
in
private
school.
As
I
was
probably
five
or
so
and
had
no
ambition
to
go
to
private
school,
I
ignored
her.
The
first
thing
I
remember
writing
was
a
story
called
NThe
Fall
of
the
ElvesO
Treehouse,O
a
seven-page
attempt
at
creative
writing,
featuring
a
girl
riding
through
the
forest
and
finding
elves.
All
of
the
characters
had
names
that
were
vaguely
ripped
off
of
Pokmon
creatures,
and
in
fact
many
of
my
early
attempts
at
writing
stories
had
elements
taken
from
other
literature.
I
think
I
read
so
much
that
anything
I
wrote
came
out
in
the
form
of
not-so-veiled
mash-ups
of
books.
Fortunately
for
me,
my
parents
have
also
told
me
that
I
made
very
strange
connections
when
I
was
young,
which
probably
hid
the
fact
that
I
was
just
mixing
up
stories
I
already
knew.
I
wasnOt
actually
trying
to
copy
anything,
my
mind
was
just
full
of
books
IOd
read,
so
those
were
the
elements
I
drew
from
while
writing.
Age
seven,
I
actually
did
go
to
private
school,
where
I
was
elated
to
find
out
that
Anna
was
wrong
about
the
strictness
of
private
schools
in
regards
to
formation
of
the
letter
NaO.
However,
we
were
made
to
write
with
fountain
pens
and
in
joined-up
handwriting,
something
every
English
school
child
can
do
in
their
sleep
but
is
totally
unfamiliar
to
Americans.
It
isnOt
cursive;
it
is
more
like
printed
handwriting
but
most
of
the
letters
are
connected,
except
for
all
capital
letters,
and
some
that
donOt
connect
well.
It
seems
fairly
ridiculous
now
that
we
were
made
to
write
like
that,
because
itOs
neither
elegant
nor
particularly
easy
to
read,
but
that
was
what
the
teachers
wanted.
We
were
told
all
the
time
that
we
had
to
write
with
fountain
pens
in
joined-up
handwriting
because
otherwise
the
teachers
in
senior
school
wouldnOt
read
our
essays.
Furthermore,
if
we
made
a
mistake
while
writing,
we
had
to
take
a
ruler
and
pencil
and
make
a
single
line
through
the
incorrect
word.
Similarly,
all
titles
had
to
be
underlined
using
a
ruler
and
pencil.
I
donOt
remember
typing
anything
in
prep
school,
or
writing
any
type
of
research
paper.
We
focused
instead
on
writing
short
essays
in
books
that
we
had,
mostly
fictional
or
from
a
personal
perspective,
which
suited
me
fine,
as
I
still
read
novels
voraciously
and
unintentionally
mimicked
the
style
of
the
books
I
read.
We
always
wrote
everything
as
fast
as
possible,
were
usually
praised
for
finishing
quickly,
and
had
absolutely
no
concept
of
rewriting
or
editing
anything
weOd
done
D
once
it
was
finished,
it
was
finished.
Towards
the
end
of
prep
school,
when
I
was
ten
years
old,
I
had
to
sit
a
number
of
entrance
exams
to
decide
where
I
would
go
to
senior
school.
I
remember
being
handed
various
essay
prompts,
thinking
most
of
them
were
ridiculous,
and
writing
something
that
I
found
contrived.
For
the
school
I
actually
did
go
to,
I
had
to
write
an
essay
involving
one
of
the
four
natural
elements,
and
wrote
about
a
dog
called
Cody
nearly
drowning.
As
usual,
I
had
borrowed
the
name
Cody
from
somewhere,
in
this
case
a
horror
film.
IOd
never
heard
the
name
Cody
before
so
I
used
it
because
I
thought
it
was
unique.
I
thought
the
story
I
wrote
was
fairly
stupid,
and
was
amazed
that
the
school
actually
liked
it.
I
hated
writing
for
situations
where
I
knew
it
was
only
so
someone
could
see
how
well
I
wrote.
Writing
for
writing
examinations
didnOt
appeal
at
all
to
me,
so
the
tests
never
reflected
how
I
normally
wrote.
In
senior
school,
writing
was
taken
a
bit
more
seriously.
There
were
several
instances
where
writing
was
used
as
a
punishment:
a
boy
had
to
write
an
essay
on
clowns
after
he
spent
one
of
his
classes
Nclowning
around,O
I
had
to
write
an
essay
on
the
importance
of
chemistry
in
my
life
after
failing
to
turn
in
my
chemistry
homework
two
times
out
of
three,
and
subsequently
had
to
copy
school
rules
for
the
rest
of
the
detention
hour.
Despite
the
many
assurances
of
teachers
from
years
past,
the
senior
school
staff
couldnOt
have
cared
less
whether
we
wrote
in
fountain
pen
or
not,
as
long
as
the
writing
was
legible.
Joined-up
handwriting
became
a
thing
of
the
past
for
most
students.
The
only
restriction
on
how
we
wrote
was
that
we
absolutely
had
to
use
a
pencil
for
mathematics,
and
some
type
of
blue
or
black
pen
for
every
other
subject,
the
logic
behind
this
being
that
mathematics
was
where
we
would
make
the
most
mistakes.
Writing
was
not
a
very
memorable
part
of
my
life
at
that
time.
However,
in
eighth
grade,
my
first
year
in
the
U.S.,
I
remember
one
essay
in
particular.
Our
first
major
assignment
of
the
year
was
to
write
an
essay
about
honor
codes.
I
spelt
the
word
honor
with
a
NuO
in
the
paper:
Nhonour
code,O
and
my
teacher
subsequently
went
through
and
crossed
out
every
NuO
in
honor.
I
didnOt
like
the
fact
that
she
thought
doing
it
once
wasnOt
sufficient,
and
felt
insulted.
I
also
encountered
works
cited
for
the
first
time,
which
was
a
change
from
just
listing
the
titles
of
books
or
websites
I
had
referenced
at
the
end
of
the
paper.
The
librarian
was
in
charge
of
correcting
the
works
cited,
and
was
extremely
strict
about
every
detail
of
the
document,
which
seemed
slightly
unnecessary
given
the
scope
of
the
assignments,
but
which
probably
prepared
me
well
for
citing
sources
in
the
future.
The
most
unfamiliar
part
of
assignments
in
U.S.
schools
was
that
they
came
with
a
rubric
attached,
which
IOd
never
seen
before.
I
was
accustomed
to
handing
essays
to
a
teacher
and
allowing
them
to
decide
whether
it
was
NgoodO
or
NbadO
based
on
personal
subjectivity,
and
therefore
thought
of
the
process
of
grading
writing
as
entirely
subjective.
I
was
therefore
thoroughly
dubious
about
the
ability
of
a
table
to
give
me
a
grade,
feeling
that
it
couldnOt
possibly
cover
all
the
factors
that
made
NgoodO
writing
good.
In
high
school,
the
quantity
of
writing
assigned
increased
greatly,
and
we
were
also
assigned
research
papers
more
frequently.
The
first
time
I
wrote
a
long
research
paper,
it
was
on
the
historical
mystery
of
who
really
discovered
America,
as
there
is
a
theory
that
the
Chinese
discovered
the
continent
in
1492.
Although
it
seemed
daunting
to
have
to
write
a
paper
that
was
about
seven
pages
long,
the
teacher
broke
up
the
work
into
so
many
smaller
chunks
that
it
was
fairly
manageable.
In
other
papers,
when
we
were
given
more
independence
with
the
writing
timeline,
I
occasionally
struggled
to
break
it
up
well
and
ended
up
doing
it
all
in
one
sitting.
Either
I
would
start
writing,
and
write
so
little
that
hardly
anything
had
been
accomplished,
or
I
would
sit
down,
start
writing,
and
want
to
get
it
all
over
with.
In
retrospect
this
was
definitely
not
the
best
technique
for
writing
good
papers,
but
fortunately
I
managed
to
get
away
with
it
for
most
of
high
school.
Research
papers
were
assigned
to
me
every
year
of
high
school,
in
various
formats.
The
paper
I
most
enjoyed
writing
was
an
essay
set
by
our
A.P.
U.S.
History
teacher,
and
was
a
twenty-page
collection
of
letters
between
fictional
characters
from
the
Civil
War
era.
I
liked
the
paper
because
it
reminded
me
of
the
type
of
writing
I
had
done
when
I
was
younger,
and
I
also
found
it
easier
to
write
fiction
based
around
facts
than
solid
factual
writing.
Being
allowed
to
invent
a
perspective
was
interesting.
On
the
other
hand,
I
was
not
a
fan
of
writing
literary
analyses.
I
felt
like
everything
I
was
writing
was
really
contrived
and
rarely
thought
that
I
was
actually
uncovering
the
authorOs
intention.
Because
I
wrote
most
things
at
face
value
without
a
lot
of
symbolism,
I
found
it
hard
to
believe
my
teachersO
assurances
that
virtually
everything
in
a
story
was
representative
of
something
else.
In
particular,
I
remember
my
freshman
English
teacher
telling
us
that
because
a
characterOs
house
was
painted
black
and
white,
it
meant
that
she
was
accepting
of
all
races,
and
thinking
that
it
probably
just
meant
that
she
like
colonial-style
exteriors.
I
attempted
to
find
symbolism
in
the
literature
we
read
and
usually
managed
to
come
up
with
an
approximation
of
what
the
teacher
deemed
right,
but
I
never
felt
particularly
genuine
doing
it.
The
final
type
of
writing
we
encountered
in
high
school
was
the
college
application
essay.
I
started
working
on
these
the
summer
before
senior
year
and
had
a
number
of
ideas,
but
as
most
people
do,
I
had
a
hard
time
knowing
how
to
sum
myself
up
in
five
hundred
words.
I
also
tended
to
read
through
essays
I
had
previously
written
and
think
that
it
didnOt
sound
like
something
I
would
write
at
all,
and
I
wanted
to
avoid
this
happening
in
my
college
essay.
In
our
English
class
senior
year,
our
teacher
helped
edit
our
essays
and
we
showed
them
to
the
class
for
critique.
This
was
one
of
the
first
times
I
had
shown
personal
writing
to
other
people
and
it
was
a
bit
daunting.
Fortunately
it
was
fairly
well
received
and
even
though
I
spent
the
whole
time
it
was
being
critiqued
trying
to
distract
myself
because
I
was
embarrassed,
the
comments
the
class
made
did
help
me
edit.
College
essays
were
also
challenging
because
I
had
to
write
so
many
variations
that
concentrating
on
every
single
supplementary
essay
became
very
difficult.
I
was
happy
to
finally
submit
them
all
so
that
I
could
stop
trying
to
condense
myself
into
two
hundred
and
fifty
words.
The
SATs
were
another
writing
obstacle
to
be
surmounted.
Despite
the
fact
that
I
thought
I
was
a
better
writer
than
mathematician,
relative
to
other
students,
I
did
much
better
on
the
math
portion
of
the
exam
than
the
writing
part.
I
suppose
this
was
due
to
the
fact
that
I
have
a
hard
time
trying
to
prove
a
point
in
so
few
words,
and
relied
more
on
theoretical
argument
than
actual
examples.
I
might
have
done
better
if
I
had
listened
to
the
advice
to
just
make
up
examples
to
prove
a
point
rather
than
trying
to
think
of
real
examples.
I
did
not
like
the
writing
portion
of
the
SAT
because
it
was
so
short,
contained
such
random
topics,
and
was
graded
on
such
strict
guidelines.
After
all
the
essays
were
over
and
IOd
actually
arrived
at
college,
I
encountered
a
different
approach
to
writing
from
what
I
had
done
in
the
past.
Rather
than
being
given
an
assignment
and
a
due
date,
as
in
so
many
high
school
classes,
editing
became
a
forced
part
of
the
process.
In
high
school,
we
had
sometimes
had
to
submit
a
Nrough
draftO
a
few
days
before
the
actual
paper
was
due,
but
in
most
cases
that
meant
turning
in
a
paper
that
was
two-thirds
complete,
or
one
that
had
no
introduction
and
conclusion.
In
college,
I
quickly
learned
that
a
Nrough
draft,O
meant
a
complete
copy
of
the
paper,
basically
what
I
would
have
previously
turned
in
as
a
final
draft.
The
final
draft
was
a
rewritten
and
edited
copy
of
the
first
or
second
(or
even
third)
drafts.
Initially,
I
found
it
hard
to
edit
an
essay
once
it
was
already
complete
D
after
all,
it
was
finished.
The
first
few
times
I
had
to
edit
an
essay,
I
made
superficial
changes
or
changed
things
for
no
particular
reason
other
than
needing
to
produce
an
essay
that
was
different
from
my
first
one.
However,
after
hearing
feedback
on
the
first
drafts
from
my
professors
and
writing
associates
a
few
times,
I
started
looking
at
my
own
writing
more
critically
and
noticing
what
changes
needed
to
be
made
to
make
it
a
more
effective
paper.
My
First
Year
Seminar
was
a
rather
frustrating
writing
experience
for
me,
because
we
were
mostly
asked
to
write
very
factual
essays,
and
making
an
argument
without
every
aspect
of
it
being
backed
by
solid
fact
was
frowned
upon.
I
had
a
hard
time
with
this
because
I
was
used
to
writing
more
rhetorically,
and
although
I
did
know
the
importance
of
backing
everything
up
with
fact
I
had
never
taken
it
to
the
level
that
was
demanded
by
my
seminar.
Although
I
didnOt
particularly
enjoy
writing
for
that
class,
I
do
think
it
helped
teach
me
how
to
edit
my
writing
because
the
unfamiliar
style
forced
me
to
review
everything
I
wrote
several
times
and
try
to
see
it
from
my
professorOs
perspective.
I
almost
entirely
rewrote
my
final
paper
three
or
four
times
before
I
was
able
to
produce
a
copy
that
my
professor
found
satisfactorily
free
of
possible
rebuttal
points.
For
me,
the
seminar
also
emphasized
that
I
needed
to
learn
to
adapt
my
style
of
writing
to
different
contexts.
As
Bartholomae
says
in
NInventing
the
Universe,O
Na
student
(E)
must
learn
to
try
on
a
variety
of
voices
and
interpretive
schemes,O
something
I
tried
to
do
both
in
high
school
literary
analyses
and
also
in
my
seminar.
Another
voice
to
be
Ntried
onO
in
college
was
a
scientific
one:
I
had
to
write
several
lab
reports
for
my
introductory
biology
courses.
The
physics
reports
I
wrote
in
my
last
two
years
of
high
school
were
mostly
based
on
mathematics,
and
I
hadnOt
written
a
biology
report
since
freshman
year
of
high
school.
Trying
to
condense
my
writing
and
sound
scientific
was
a
challenge,
because
I
never
knew
what
the
knowledge
level
of
my
audience
was.
For
example,
I
didnOt
know
if
it
was
appropriate
to
mention
that
I
had
used
a
volumetric
flask
to
mix
the
two
solutions,
or
if
this
was
something
that
was
so
obvious
to
a
professional
scientist
that
there
was
no
point
in
bringing
it
up.
Reading
a
lot
of
scientific
papers
at
the
beginning
of
the
EXCEL
research
I
did
this
summer
was
helpful
in
clarifying
to
me
what
should
be
included
in
a
lab
report.
Similarly
to
how
I
imitated
fiction
when
I
was
learning
to
write
short
stories,
reading
scientific
papers
gave
me
something
to
imitate
when
learning
to
summarize
my
own
research
D
although
now
I
am
more
conscious
of
the
difference
between
imitating
a
general
style
of
writing
and
copying
someone
elseOs
specific
style.
Although
I
have
never
thought
of
writing
as
being
a
major
component
of
my
life,
it
is
something
that
has
been
present
throughout
my
school
years,
and
I
am
thankful
for
being
taught
not
only
how
to
write
letters
and
words,
but
how
to
write
arguments
and
express
myself
through
the
medium
of
writing.
