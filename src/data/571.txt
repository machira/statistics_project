A
History
of
Writing
When
thinking
back
to
my
first
experiences,
mostly
struggles,
as
a
writer,
the
awkwardly
worded
phrase
rToday
Ii
did
my
tToday
Ius
always
comes
to
mind.
I
remember
in
second
grade,
my
teacher
would
give
the
class
a
daily
writing
exercise
at
the
end
of
each
school
day.
The
exercise
called
the
rToday
Is
was
pretty
self-explanatory.
All
that
was
required
of
me
and
my
fellow
students
was
to
write
a
few
brief
sentences
in
our
notebooks
about
what
we
did
in
school
that
day,
whether
it
was
in
the
classroom,
the
gym,
or
the
playground.
Thinking
back
now,
I
cannot
imagine
how
difficult
it
was
to
reflect
on
what
I
did
during
the
seven
hour
school
day,
but
I
remember
it
being
such
a
struggle
for
me
then.
My
fellow
classmates
and
I
dreaded
the
exercise.
Perhaps
our
disdain
for
the
assignment
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
school
day
was
coming
to
a
close
and
we
were
all
excited
to
go
home
and
watch
Power
Rangers
and
play
Sega
Genesis.
In
order
to
get
through
the
exercise
quickly
my
friends
and
I
simply
wanted
to
write
that
the
only
activity
we
did
that
day
was
our
rToday
Is
assignment.
I
guess
I
could
say
that
small
quip
was
also
my
first
attempt
at
writing
humor.
Ium
sure
The
Tonight
Show
will
be
calling
me
for
a
job
soon.
As
much
as
I
dreaded
that
daily
writing
assignment,
I
soon
became
grateful
for
all
the
skills
it
taught
me.
It
caused
me
to
be
more
observant
throughout
my
daily
routine,
trying
to
look
for
something
interesting
to
write
about
at
the
end
of
the
day.
It
also
taught
me
to
use
my
creativity,
because
I
would
sometimes
give
myself
a
little
leeway
and
perhaps
embellish
some
details
to
make
my
writing
more
interesting.
It
also
taught
me
right
away
that
writing
was
a
process
that
would
not
always
be
easy
for
me.
I
grew
to
appreciate
the
challenge
of
putting
pen
on
paper
or
characters
on
a
computer
in
order
to
formulate
a
cohesive
story.
As
I
advanced
throughout
elementary
school
I
began
to
undertake
more
complex
writing
assignments.
I
was
armed
with
greater
tools
from
instruction
in
vocabulary,
spelling,
and
grammar
lessons.
I
began
to
combine
creative
and
analytical
writing
through
the
common
assignment
of
the
book
report.
I
always
enjoyed
the
book
reports
where
there
were
no
restrictions
on
the
type
of
book
I
could
choose.
I
would
usually
pick
books
regarding
sports.
I
remember
being
a
big
fan
of
professional
athlete
biographies,
reading
about
some
of
the
great
90us
athletes
like
Eric
Lindros,
Hakeem
Olajuwon,
and
Steve
Young,
as
well
as
some
athletes
from
the
past
like
Mickey
Mantle
and
Bobby
Orr.
I
was
not
as
interested
in
some
categories
such
as
historical
fiction.
Whatever
the
topic
of
the
book,
I
was
able
to
learn
valuable
lessons.
For
starters,
reading
books
helped
me
improve
my
writing,
because
I
was
able
to
take
pointers
in
terms
of
word
choice,
sentence
structure,
and
style
from
some
of
my
favorite
writers.
Book
reports
also
offered
good
precursors
for
the
countless
literary
analysis
papers
I
have
done
in
numerous
English
classes
in
grade
school,
high
school,
and
at
Lafayette.
With
some
book
reports,
I
was
also
able
to
improve
on
my
creative
writing.
I
remember
one
common
required
question
for
some
book
reports
was
rIf
you
were
to
re-write
the
bookus
ending,
how
would
you
have
it
end?s
I
though
that
was
an
interesting
question
that
required
a
great
deal
of
creative
thinking.
I
remember
having
a
good
amount
of
difficulty
trying
to
come
up
with
new
ways
to
end
stories.
It
seemed
like
the
endings
of
the
stories
fit
so
well
that
there
was
no
other
way
that
I
could
make
it
work
with
an
ending
of
my
own.
I
was,
at
first,
unable
to
imagine
another
way
the
book
could
actually
end.
It
took
a
good
amount
of
creative
process
for
me
to
try
to
come
up
with
endings
that
were
both
interesting
and
coherent
with
the
rest
of
the
story.
I
think
creating
my
own
endings
to
stories
helped
out
greatly
in
my
creative
writing
process,
because
when
I
write
entire
stories
on
my
own,
I
still
have
to
come
up
with
an
ending
that
fits
in
with
the
rest
of
the
story.
Reading
many
books
for
book
reports
also
helped
me
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
structure
of
the
story.
In
my
early
years
of
school,
I
learned
that
all
stories
had
a
beginning,
middle,
and
end.
I
learned
there
were
rising
action,
a
conflict,
and
falling
action.
Reading
a
plethora
of
books
and
stories
made
me
realize
that
every
story
did
not
have
to
completely
adhere
to
that
exact
pattern.
As
I
advanced
in
my
school
years
I
learned
that
a
writer
has
more
freedom.
I
did
not
have
to
follow
a
set
structure.
I
learned
that
changing
the
form
of
a
story
from
what
people
expect
may
actually
make
the
story
more
interesting.
As
I
advanced
into
my
middle
school
years,
I
began
to
develop
stronger,
but
mixed
feelings
towards
writing.
There
were
some
parts
of
it
that
I
disliked,
especially
some
of
the
writing
assignments
I
had
to
do
in
my
middle
school
classes.
In
school,
some
writing
became
more
frustrating
because
I
had
to
read
more
difficult
books
and
undertake
more
tricky
and
challenging
assignments.
I
also
began
to
work
more
extensively
on
research
papers,
which
added
the
extra
challenge
of
a
fact-finding
mission.
I
went
from
having
to
read
an
assigned
book
or
article
to
have
to
actually
go
to
a
library
or
on
the
internet
to
find
sources
that
pertained
to
the
overall
theme
of
my
paper.
One
positive
aspect
of
research
was
it
helped
me
gain
a
better
understanding
of
how
find
sources
to
back
up
my
argument
or
position.
I
also
learned
more
about
how
to
use
a
library
and
the
constantly
changing
computer
technology.
In
addition
to
research
papers,
I
also
sometimes
struggled
with
writing
lab
reports
for
science
classes,
because
I
usually
had
to
write
them
in
a
form
I
was
not
used
to-
passive
voice-
and
had
to
write
about
material
with
which
I
was
not
always
familiar.
I
also
remember
having
some
early
struggles
with
sentence
structure
and
grammar
as
well.
In
seventh
grade,
I
remember
having
to
do
rDaily
Edits
each
day.
My
teacher
would
put
a
few
sentences
on
the
chalkboard,
each
filled
with
one
or
more
mistakes.
My
fellow
students
and
I
had
to
copy
the
sentences
in
our
notebooks
and
then
find
and
correct
the
mistakes.
My
teacher
was
very
observant
of
her
studentsu
writing,
so
she
would
put
common
mistakes
we
made
in
the
rDaily
Edits
sentences.
This
made
the
rDaily
Edits
more
challenging,
because
it
was
often
difficult
for
my
fellow
students
and
me
to
notice
the
mistakes
we
commonly
made.
I
later
realized
how
valuable
this
practice
was,
because
it
allowed
me
to
correct
my
errors
in
grammar.
I
know
now
that
no
matter
how
interesting
a
storyus
content
is,
if
it
is
not
written
in
a
correct
manner
that
makes
sense
to
the
reader,
the
story
will
be
disagreeable
for
its
readers.
These
early
grammar
lessons
proved
valuable
for
all
types
of
writing,
because
no
matter
if
I
was
writing
a
book
report
or
a
creative
short
story,
it
had
to
contain
proper
grammar.
Learning
grammar
also
helped
me
in
my
position
of
a
newspaper
editor
in
both
high
school
and
here
at
Lafayette
College.
Another
valuable
lesson
about
writing
that
I
learned
as
I
grew
older
was
that
writing
was
a
process
in
which
I
could
partake
outside
of
the
academic
realm.
I
began
to
write
for
fun,
scribbling
various
thoughts
with
a
pen
into
a
notebook
that
became
a
personal
journal
for
me.
I
began
to
see
the
skills
I
had
picked
up
as
a
writer
in
school
could
translate
into
an
outlet
of
dealing
with
the
stresses
that
come
along
with
being
a
teenager.
I
was
able
to
keep
writing
very
personal
for
me,
because
I
was
able
to
write
about
whatever
I
wanted
in
whatever
form
I
wanted.
I
could
write
a
stream
of
consciousness
(although
I
am
sure
I
was
not
aware
of
what
that
was
in
seventh
grade),
some
song
lyrics,
a
creative
story,
or
even
a
poem
or
two.
Writing
in
this
journal
helped
me
keep
a
passion
for
writing.
During
school,
the
constant
research
papers
and
lab
reports
made
writing
seem
like
a
chore,
so
keeping
a
journal
made
me
remember
that
writing
was
something
enjoyable
that
I
could
do
for
fun.
As
I
entered
high
school,
I
was
further
exposed
to
the
various
genres
of
literature
and
writing.
In
freshman
year
I
was
reading
Shakespeare,
Salinger,
and
Achebe.
I
took
a
lot
from
these
great
writers,
and
I
was
able
to
learn
more
about
writing
both
from
my
teachers
and
fellow
students.
Before
high
school,
I
was
not
really
exposed
to
the
concept
of
peer
review.
I
had
never
really
shown
assignments
to
anyone
other
than
my
teachers
or
my
parents,
who
would
help
give
me
pointers
and
would
want
to
look
at
completed
assignments.
I
admit
I
was
unsure
at
first
if
I
was
ready
to
share
my
work
with
others.
I
thought
my
writing
was
decent,
but
since
I
had
not
read
my
fellow
studentsu
works
either,
I
was
unsure
as
to
how
my
writing
would
be
perceived
by
others.
Thankfully
my
freshman
year
English
teacher
helped
all
the
students
out
by
giving
us
checklists
and
guidelines
for
peer
editing.
I
am
extremely
grateful
that
I
was
able
to
participate
in
the
process
of
peer
review.
My
friends
and
classmates
gave
me
countless
amounts
of
helpful
advice
to
make
me
a
better
writer.
It
is
sometimes
very
difficult
for
me
to
evaluate
my
own
writing,
so
getting
a
peerus
perspective
was
valuable
to
me.
I
was
also
glad
to
be
able
to
share
my
knowledge
of
writing
with
others.
I
enjoyed
giving
advice
to
my
classmates,
and
always
tried
to
do
my
best
to
help
them
out
with
their
writing.
I
also
was
able
to
help
myself,
because
I
may
have
noticed
a
mistake
in
their
writing
that
I
had
not
noticed
in
my
own,
or
I
could
take
something
from
a
paper
that
I
particularly
liked
and
apply
it
to
my
own
writing.
My
ninth
grade
English
teacher
also
gave
valuable
feedback
to
help
improve
my
writing.
I
learned
not
to
be
upset
at
criticism,
but
to
use
it
constructively
to
help
me
become
a
better
writer.
In
tenth
grade
I
took
a
class
called
academic
writing
that
really
exposed
me
to
a
wide
range
of
writing
assignments.
I
was
able
to
do
research
papers,
creative
writing,
short
stories,
rhow
tos
papers,
personal
narratives,
comparison
and
contrast
papers,
arguments,
and
a
few
others.
In
this
class,
I
also
read
one
of
my
all-time
favorite
books,
Tom
Perottaus
Bad
Haircut.
That
collection
of
short
stories
helped
inspire
me
to
try
to
further
my
creative
writing.
In
this
class,
I
was
also
subject
to
extensive
amounts
of
peer
review,
which
furthered
my
skill
as
a
writer.
My
teacher
also
was
very
good
about
allowing
my
fellow
students
and
me
to
submit
drafts
of
papers
to
him
to
give
us
feedback
before
a
final
draft.
I
thought
this
was
very
helpful,
because
I
was
able
to
make
sure
my
papers
were
going
in
the
right
direction.
One
of
my
favorite
assignments
from
that
class
was
the
comparison
and
contrast
paper.
One
aspect
of
that
class
I
liked
was
the
freedom
we
had
in
topic
selection.
For
this
paper,
we
were
allowed
to
compare
and
contrast
any
two
objects,
people,
ideas,
moods,
etc.
I
was
grateful
for
this
choice,
because
I
was
able
to
pick
a
topic
in
an
area
of
great
interest
for
me.
I
chose
to
compare
to
NFL
quarterbacks,
Peyton
Manning
and
Donovan
McNabb.
I
compared
and
contrasted
many
aspects
of
the
two
superstars,
from
their
play
on
the
field
to
their
personality
and
demeanor
off
of
it.
That
was
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
papers
for
me,
because
doing
research
about
those
topics
was
amusing.
I
liked
looking
up
and
comparing
their
statistics
as
well
as
reading
some
of
their
quotes
and
interviews.
It
was
fun
for
me
to
compare
their
numbers
season
by
season.
I
think
my
passion
for
the
project
was
evident
in
the
paperus
final
outcome,
as
it
was
the
highest
grade
I
received
in
the
class.
My
teacher
said
it
was
my
best
written
paper
of
the
year,
and
I
recall
showing
it
to
my
parents
who
said
it
was
one
of
my
better
academic
papers
they
had
read.
Assignments
like
that
compare
and
contrast
furthered
my
interest
in
studying
writing
and
English
at
the
college
level,
and,
coupled
with
my
love
of
sports
(but
an
inability
to
play
them
well),
also
gave
me
the
desire
to
be
a
sports
editor
for
both
my
high
school
and
Lafayetteus
newspaper.
Taking
the
two
AP
English
classes
junior
and
senior
years
helped
me
gain
a
better
knowledge
of
the
nuances
of
writing.
In
junior
year,
I
was
exposed
to
the
study
of
rhetoric
and
diction
which
helped
me
better
formulate
points
in
argument
papers.
I
learned
to
avoid
poor
argument
techniques
like
ad
hominem
arguments
and
non
sequiturs.
I
was
also
fortunate
enough
to
have
a
very
passionate
teacher
who
made
learning
the
material
pleasurable
by
showing
great
enthusiasm
and
care
for
her
students.
We
would
act
out
Shakespeare
plays,
which
actually
ended
up
being
similar
to
the
theater
in
Shakespeareus
time
as
men
had
to
play
the
parts
of
women
in
my
all-male
high
school.
She
also
gave
us
daily
quizzes
to
make
sure
we
were
keeping
up
with
reading
and
studying
material.
My
senior
year
was
somewhat
similar,
where
I
again
was
able
to
act
out
some
plays
as
well
as
hone
my
writing
skills
by
frequently
turning
in
smaller
writing
assignments
based
on
nightly
readings.
My
teacher
was
a
rough
grader,
but
the
tough
standards
made
me
push
myself
to
keep
improving.
My
college
experience
with
writing
has
been
similar
to
that
of
my
senior
year
of
high
school,
with
complicated
assignments
and
knowledgeable
professors
to
help
me.
It
has
been
beneficial
for
me
to
have
resources
like
the
Writing
Associates,
my
peers,
and
professorsu
office
hours
to
help
me
succeed.
I
have
pushed
myself
even
further
in
my
higher
education,
and
while
I
may
not
have
as
much
freedom
with
paper
topic
selection,
I
have
still
been
able
to
enjoy
writing
through
my
duties
as
sports
editor
of
the
newspaper
and
my
thoughts
I
record
in
my
personal
journal.
I
hope
that
becoming
a
WA
will
help
me
take
pleasure
from
writing
even
more
as
I
will
be
able
to
share
my
abilities
with
my
peers
and
hopefully
have
the
same
positive
affect
on
them
as
countless
peers
and
educators
have
had
on
me.
While
my
history
as
a
writer
thus
far
may
seem
long
due
to
myriad
challenging
assignments
and
papers,
I
hope
it
is
just
the
introductory
chapter
of
many
accomplishments
to
come.
