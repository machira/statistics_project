From
Writing
to
NWAOingO:
My
Experiences
as
Both
Student
Writer
and
Student
Reviewer
Lafayette
College
Prof.
Bianca
Falbo
Before
I
started
college,
I
had
full
confidence
in
my
ability
and
technique
in
writing.
That
is,
I
knew
how
to
develop
an
idea
and
to
support
it
with
evidence.
Like
the
papers
that
I
would
ultimately
be
doing
in
college,
the
papers
that
I
had
done
for
my
Advanced
Placement
courses
in
high
school
were
based
on
valid,
credible
argumentation.
By
the
time
I
had
to
write
my
first
college
paper,
I
was
therefore
already
well-versed
in
the
abilities
that
were
asked
of
me.
The
assignments
for
my
first
year
seminar
class
demanded
intensive
library
research,
as
well
as
the
ability
to
fully
expound
an
argument.
The
one
salient
difference,
of
course,
between
the
writing
that
I
did
for
this
seminar
and
that
which
I
had
done
in
the
past
was
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
papers
was
harder.
Two
of
the
three
papers
that
I
submitted,
for
instance,
discussed
legal
theory;
the
third,
on
Franz
KafkaOs
The
Trial,
touched
on
existential
philosophy.
There
was
another
difference,
as
well.
While
I
had
yet
to
reach
the
point
where
my
work
might
be
confused
with
something
out
of
The
New
Yorker
D
a
veritable
end-all
standard
for
me
D
I
could
feel
myself
approaching
that
juncture
much
more
rapidly
than
I
had
before.
Indeed,
I
noticed
that
I
had
become
more
adept
at
analyzing
my
thoughts
on
paper,
at
vetting
and
completely
tearing
apart
an
idea.
In
middle
school
and
especially
in
high
school,
I
had
frequently
displayed
trenchant
insight
in
my
writing.
It
was
during
this
course,
however,
that
my
faculties
of
analysis
really
started
to
flourish.
This
past
academic
year
saw
the
continuation
of
my
growth
as
a
writer,
in
part
because
I
was
writing
in
unfamiliar
genres,
but
also
because
I
was
serving
my
first
year
as
a
Writing
Associate.
As
I
struggled
with
my
own
writing,
trying
to
live
up
to
the
standards
that
I
had
staked
out
for
myself,
I
had
to
at
the
same
time
dispense
advice
to
my
fellow
classmates
according
to
what
I
believed
was
commendable
writing.
Such
questions
as
NIs
there
such
a
thing
as
a
good,
but
poorly
written,
paper,O
and
NWhat
are
the
key
elements
of
a
personal
style
of
writing,O
which
I
had
wrestled
with
before,
took
on
a
pressing
new
significance.
For
the
first
time
in
my
academic
career,
I
found
myself
worrying
about
more
than
simply
my
own
papers.
If
nothing
else,
my
experience
as
a
writer
this
year
allowed
me
to
sample
the
distinctive
styles
of
various
academic
disciplines.
From
the
rigors
of
philosophical
analysis
to
the
more
permissive
flow
of
the
literature
paper,
I
was
thrust
into
writing
for
audiences
whose
expectations
I
was
only
vaguely
familiar
with.
To
be
sure,
each
discipline
has
its
own
vernacular,
its
own
preferred
method
of
presenting
ideas,
and
its
own
tone.
That
is,
while
a
well-put
but
somewhat
wordy
sentence
might
be
acceptable
in
an
English
course,
it
would
probably
be
unacceptable
in
a
philosophy
or
science
course.
Inevitably,
I
developed
a
taste
for
some
styles
and
a
distaste
for
others.
Although
an
intellectual
challenge
to
compose
a
cogent
philosophy
paper,
I
soon
began
to
feel
stifled
by
the
style
of
writing
required
for
such
a
paper.
I
found
the
format
of
the
research
paper
to
be
similarly
restrictive.
My
most
enjoyable
and
rewarding
experiences
came
from
the
writing
that
I
did
for
my
Literary
Questions
class
and
VAST
seminar.
To
my
dissatisfaction,
my
identity
as
a
writer
has
remained
essentially
unchanged
from
previous
years.
Organizing
my
writing
into
a
coherent
unit,
providing
evidence
for
my
claims,
and
developing
an
argument
have
always
ranked
among
my
stronger
points.
I
have
also
long
prided
myself
on
my
ability
to
articulate
my
thoughts
with
precision.
During
this
past
year,
however,
I
looked
at
my
writing
style
more
critically
and
found
that
I
was
bored
of
the
same
syntactical
patterns,
the
same
cadence
which
my
writing
often
falls
into.
None
of
my
professors
had
said
anything.
For
the
most
part,
they
enjoyed
what
I
wrote.
In
high
school,
as
well,
my
teachers
had
always
praised
my
work.
Yet,
until
last
year,
I
never
really
took
a
step
back
from
my
work
and
tried
to
look
at
it
from
an
outsiderOs
vantage
or
compare
it
with
the
articles
in
professional
journals
and
magazines.
My
style,
I
concluded,
had
a
tendency
to
come
off
as
too
grandiose.
I
did
have
some
works
that
I
could
objectively
say
met,
or
exceeded,
my
standards.
But,
by
and
large,
I
felt
that
my
style
was
in
need
of
change.
The
one
difference
that
I
did
notice,
though,
was
that
I
was
writing
more
effortlessly
and
perhaps
more
loosely.
Almost
out
of
necessity,
I
also
chose
to
re-evaluate
the
way
that
I
approached
the
revision
process.
Whereas
in
years
past
I
would
find
myself
poring
over
the
same
sentences
for
what
seemed
like
hours,
I
would
now
make
it
a
point
to
use
my
initial
drafts
simply
as
a
groundwork,
or
frame,
for
my
ideas.
It
was
only
when
this
groundwork
was
firmly
in
place
that
I
then
considered
how
to
go
about
polishing
and
refining
those
ideas.
This
frequently
involved
inserting
new
paragraphs,
tweaking
others,
and
shifting
information
from
place
to
place,
until
I
was
convinced
that
what
I
had
written
read
as
smoothly
as
possible.
My
change
in
attitude
was
more
or
less
spontaneous
and
unconscious,
though
I
believe
that
it
has
enabled
me
to
write
more
efficiently.
As
I
mentioned
at
the
outset,
working
as
a
WA
has
helped
to
cultivate
my
talent
as
a
writer.
As
I
gained
more
confidence
in
identifying
what
most
often
went
wrong
in
the
writing
of
my
peers,
I
grew
more
diligent
in
looking
for,
as
well
as
more
adept
in
solving,
those
same
problems
in
my
own
work.
Moreover,
I
believe
that
working
as
a
WA
has
improved
my
ability
not
only
in
thinking
analytically
about
the
arguments
that
others
posit,
but
in
considering
the
logic
of
my
own
thoughts
and
in
examining
the
manner
in
which
I
chose
to
express
them
on
paper.
Conversely,
my
own
background
as
a
student
writer
has
played
a
role
in
defining
the
snags
and
pitfalls
that
I
typically
look
for
as
a
WA
when
reading
other
studentsO
papers.
The
help
that
I
provided
to
my
peers
was
influenced
by
some
of
the
difficulties
that
I
might
have
been
having
at
the
time,
as
well
as
some
of
the
criticism
that
I
had
received
from
my
professors.
For
instance,
during
the
fall
semester,
while
I
was
taking
the
first
philosophy
course
of
my
college
career
and
was
still
learning
about
the
form
and
style
of
arguments
that
philosophers
use
in
their
writing,
I
was
inclined
to
make
suggestions
about
logical
organization.
The
ability
to
write
clearly
and
succinctly,
something
that
was
stressed
in
a
psychology
methods
course
that
I
took
last
spring,
was
another
area
that
I
gravitated
toward
when
looking
at
studentsO
papers.
As
I
began
conferencing
with
my
peers,
I
noticed
that
certain
patterns
of
errors
emerged.
Superficial
grammatical
mistakes
from
comma
splices
to
dangling
modifiers
were
common,
for
instance.
I
also
found
that
the
student
who
could
develop
his
argument
fully
in
clear,
understandable
terms
was
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule.
In
general,
the
papers
that
I
saw
were
poorly
organized
and,
sometimes,
plain
sloppy.
Yet,
although
I
could
intuitively
point
out
to
myself
areas
that
I
felt
needed
improvement,
communicating
my
thoughts
to
the
students
proved
an
entirely
different
story.
It
is
difficult
to
tell
a
student
that
his
writing
lacks
a
consistent
thread
of
argument,
or
that
before
starting
a
discussion
of
a
term,
it
helps
to
define
what
the
term
is.
What
is
more,
while
I
frequently
found
myself
wanting
to
draw
on
my
authority
as
a
knowledgeable
peer
reviewer,
I
was
constantly
aware
of
how
thin
a
line
I
walked
between
attempting
to
draw
on
that
authority
and
becoming
an
authoritarian
who
might
potentially
alienate
an
already
frustrated
writer.
Making
communication
even
more
difficult
was
the
fact
that
while
some
students
were
willing
to
discuss
their
thoughts
very
freely,
others
were
not
so
candid.
Further,
some
students
came
unprepared
to
their
conferences,
which
forced
me
to
read
their
drafts
and
make
comments
on
the
spot
D
a
skill
which
is
hard
to
come
by.
I
found
that
the
structure
of
the
WA
conference,
therefore,
must
necessarily
be
adaptive;
that
is,
it
must
be
flexible
enough
to
adjust
to
the
differing
needs
of
different
students.
For
those
students,
for
instance,
whose
drafts
I
read
before
meeting
them,
I
could
delve
into
the
more
subtle
points
of
their
writing,
such
as
diction
and
grammar.
On
the
other
hand,
for
those
students
whose
papers
I
received
on
the
day
of
the
conference,
I
would
concentrate
on
the
broader
concerns
of
thesis,
organization,
and
evidence.
Sometimes,
I
would
simply
concentrate
on
thesis.
During
the
earlier
part
of
the
year,
I
might
have
felt
guilty
if
I
had
helped
one
of
my
peers
with
only
one
area
of
concern.
Toward
the
end
of
the
spring
semester,
however,
I
realized
that
even
this
much
assistance
could
prove
valuable
to
the
struggling
student
writer.
Although
I
strove
to
uphold
many
of
the
principles
of
writing
that
I
encouraged
my
peers
to
heed,
there
were
some
that
I
thought
would
be
inappropriate
to
follow
at
times.
For
instance,
the
central
tenet
of
the
training
that
WAOs
receive
is
that
papers
should
have
an
explicit
thesis
statement.
Yet,
there
was
at
least
one
instance
(The
assignment
was
a
book
review
for
my
VAST
seminar)
in
which
I
felt
that
an
outright
argument
was
not
warranted.
Because
the
review
was
intended
to
read
more
descriptively
and
less
argumentatively,
I
opted
not
to
include
a
thesis
statement.
I
was
still
careful,
however,
to
maintain
a
consistent
thread
of
argument.
My
impression
of
the
thesis
was,
and
still
is,
that
it
is
more
a
tool
for
the
writer
than
for
the
reader.
It
not
only
forces
the
writer
to
explicitly
formulate
his
most
important
claims,
but
allows
him
to
refer
back
to
these
thoughts
throughout
the
writing
process.
Aside
from
only
a
handful
of
the
students
whom
I
helped,
therefore,
I
probably
would
not
have
suggested
this
strategy.
The
most
important
advice
that
I
have
learned
from
another
WA
has
to
do
with
the
natural
distribution
of
writing
abilities
that
one
will
encounter.
As
in
every
discipline,
he
said,
there
will
always
be
A
students,
B
students,
C
students,
and
so
on.
My
experience
has
borne
this
hypothesis
out.
Some
students
have
a
natural
affinity
for
writing,
and
others
do
not.
What
is
more,
some
students
are
more
interested
in
improving
themselves
than
others.
I
have
come
to
believe
that
the
job
of
the
WA,
therefore,
is
not
necessarily
to
transform
the
C
student
into
the
B
student,
or
the
B
student
into
the
A
student.
(That
is
not
to
say
that
it
cannot
be
done;
in
some
cases,
this
might
be
possible.)
The
job
of
the
WA
is
instead
to
pass
along
to
oneOs
fellow
writers
a
passion
for
writing.
Of
course,
the
WA
should
also
strive
to
pass
along
all
the
knowledge
that
she
can
to
her
peers
D
knowledge
about
her
own
personal
style,
what
she
does
when
she
is
at
a
seeming
impasse
and
can
find
nothing
more
to
write
about,
as
well
as
other
suggestions.
As
a
returning
WA,
I
see
myself
going
about
the
conferences
a
bit
differently.
For
one
thing,
I
intend
to
refrain
from
my
impulse
to
correct
every
single
grammatical
mistake
D
unless
they
begin
to
interfere
with
the
way
in
which
the
paper
reads.
I
also
intend
to
make
fewer
written
comments
on
the
drafts
that
students
bring
to
me.
As
we
discussed
at
one
of
the
weekly
WA
meetings
(and
as
I
know
myself),
when
there
are
many
comments,
students
often
read
the
first
few
lines
and
then
give
up.
If
more
writing
needs
to
be
done
during
the
conference
so
that
the
writer
can
have
some
sort
of
memory
prompt,
then
I
intend
to
let
the
writer
make
his
own
notes.
Finally,
I
see
myself
trying
to
help
other
student
writers
to
the
best
of
my
ability.
Unlike
last
year,
however,
I
refuse
to
allow
myself
to
feel
guilty
about
not
getting
through
to
those
writers
who
simply
do
not
seem
to
care.
