Many
might
claim
man's
attempt
to
master
fire
is
the
aspect
which
separates
man
from
the
animals
and
changed
the
course
of
history.
Writing,
however,
has
most
influenced
who
I
am
and
who
I
am
becoming.
As
a
child,
I
wrote
thank-you
notes
to
my
grandparents
consisting
of
a
greeting
and
four
or
five
basic
sentences.
Years
of
writing
experience,
in
school
and
out,
have
helped
transform
those
blunt
and
brief
messages
into
multi-page
journal
entries,
with
stories
and
details
crammed
together
as
tightly
as
space
allows.
My
history
as
a
writer
spans
more
than
fourteen
years,
beginning
before
school
and
running
through
the
present,
my
sophomore
year
in
college.
This
history
is
built
from
blocks
of
experiences,
steps
to
learning
how
to
convey
my
thoughts,
emotions,
and
ideas
in
a
coherent
and
organized
fashion.
In
my
work
as
a
writing
associate,
I
expect
I
will
draw
on
much
of
what
I
have
learned
in
my
history
as
a
writer.
My
earliest
writing
was
in
journals
I
wrote
in
first
and
second
grade.
Every
morning,
following
the
flag
salute,
there
was
a
quiet
time
reserved
for
writing
journal
entries
in
a
small
notebook.
We
were
expected
to
write
about
something,
anything,
for
five
minutes.
Most
of
my
entries
were
about
common
things
-
my
cat
or
my
mom,
going
to
Girl
Scouts
after
class
on
Tuesdays
or
piano
lessons
on
Wednesdays.
If
I
couldn't
spell
a
word,
I
could
ask
the
teacher,
but
most
often
I
spelled
it
the
way
it
sounded.
The
teachers
didn't
seem
to
mind;
the
main
goal
was
encouraging
students
to
write.
By
third
grade,
the
subject
matter
had
gotten
harder.
Rather
than
only
writing
in
journals
and
learning
basic
punctuation
and
spelling,
my
teacher
devoted
at
least
an
hour
every
day
to
English.
Students
now
had
English
books
and
folders
for
English
homework
and
reading.
Students
were
expected
to
write
more
than
in
previous
years.
My
teacher,
Mrs.
Brigham,
made
all
the
students
write
a
story
for
Valentine's
Day.
I
enjoyed
writing
the
story,
creating
dialogues
for
the
characters
and
describing
the
scene,
but
I
didn't
appreciate
peer
reading
and
editing.
I
brought
my
story
to
class
neatly
written
in
black
ink
and
heard
Mrs.
Brigham
tell
the
class
to
give
our
papers
to
a
classmate
and
have
them
read
and
comment
on
our
stories.
Mrs.
Brigham
had
gone
over
the
structure
of
the
plot
using
a
diagram
which
looked
like
a
witch's
hat
and
made
it
all
sound
easy.
I
was
certain
I
had
done
the
assignment
correctly
and
I
would
do
well.
I
was
horrified
and
bewildered
by
the
comments
my
paper
received.
The
student
who
read
my
paper
thought
my
story
was
"dumb
and
boring."
This
experience
gave
me
a
dislike
of
the
peer
reading
and
editing
process
that
still
persists.
In
theory,
peer
reading
sounds
like
a
great
idea;
students
read
each
others
work
and
give
input,
finding
weak
points
and
suggesting
possible
solutions
or
spotting
strong
spots
and
explaining
why
these
parts
worked
well.
In
reality,
third
graders
were
critical
and
unforgiving;
no
one
liked
anyone
else's
papers
as
much
as
their
own,
deciding
that
everyone
else
wrote
"dumb
and
boring"
stories
while
theirs
was
stellar
and
worthy
of
immediate
publication
in
the
school
literary
magazine.
In
third
grade,
I
learned
that
it
was
easy
to
be
a
critic,
and
my
own
experience
introduced
me
to
the
idea
that
criticism
without
a
measure
of
tact
or
forethought
could
be
deflating
to
a
young
writer.
Finally,
I
decided
that
I
didn't
like
other
people
reading
what
I
wrote,
that
I
absolutely
hated
having
my
papers
critiqued
by
someone
my
own
age,
even
when
the
comments
were
well
meaning
or
not
as
harsh
as
I
imagined.
Fifth
grade
marked
a
period
of
change
for
me
as
a
writer,
with
the
introduction
of
computers
in
the
classroom,
my
first
encounter
with
a
research
paper,
and
some
serious
work
on
grammar.
Prior
to
fifth
grade,
blue
or
black
pens
were
required
school
supplies,
with
all
written
responses,
journal
entries,
or
papers
written
by
hand
in
ink.
My
fourth
grade
report
on
the
California
Gold
Rush
was
written
in
black
pen
on
lined
paper
the
morning
it
was
due.
My
fifth
grade
famous
person
report
was
required
to
be
typed
using
either
a
typewriter
or
a
computer.
Each
student
selected
a
famous
person
and
wrote
a
biography
on
that
person.
Ms.
Nemgar,
my
fifth
grade
teacher,
was
very
specific
about
what
she
wanted
done,
which
parts
had
to
be
turned
in
and
when,
and
what
she
expected
from
the
students.
This
was
my
first
research
project
and
was
challenging
for
me
because
I
had
to
read
books,
many
of
which
were
intended
for
adults,
and
glean
bits
of
information
to
be
used
in
my
report.
We
also
had
to
turn
in
an
outline
and
a
rough
draft.
Ms.
Nemgar
was
a
"tough"
grader,
one
who
read
critically
and
was
very
picky.
She
was
the
first
teacher
I
had
who
checked
for
grammar
and
misspellings,
sentence
fragments
and
run
on
sentences.
Additionally,
every
other
day,
we
had
Daily
Oral
Language
sets,
two
sentences
with
errors
in
punctuation
and
general
grammar.
Students
had
to
copy
down
the
sentences
and
mark
corrections.
We
also
had
thick
pink
grammar
books,
with
sections
we
had
to
read
on
commas,
periods,
and
other
forms,
as
well
as
the
proper
and
improper
uses
of
punctuation.
Correcting
the
sentences
for
Daily
Oral
Language
was
fun
because
at
the
end
of
the
month,
the
students
who
had
gotten
the
most
answers
correct
got
a
piece
of
candy.
Reading
about
grammar
and
punctuation
was
dry
and
dull,
an
activity
I
dreaded
and
only
did
because
I
had
to
do
the
reading
just
in
case
there
was
a
quiz.
While
fifth
grade
was
my
introduction
to
research
papers
and
proper
punctuation,
sixth
grade
reexposed
me
to
creative
writing.
The
first
homework
assignment
my
teacher,
Mr.
Purdie,
gave
us
was
to
list
as
many
descriptive
color-words
as
possible.
In
my
excitement,
I
went
through
every
crayon,
colored
pencil,
clothing
catalogue,
and
Sunset
magazine
in
my
house,
scrounging
every
color-word
I
could
find.
I
arrived
at
school
the
next
morning
with
my
list
of
over
two
hundred
words
and
was
a
bit
embarrassed
while
at
the
same
time
pleased
to
learn
that
most
students
had
much
shorter
lists
than
mine.
The
next
week's
assignment
was
to
create
a
list
of
all
the
adjectives
we
could
find
to
describe
a
way
of
speaking,
including
loud,
soft,
and
others.
These
lists
were
my
teacher's
method
of
introducing
us
to
description
and
figurative
language.
Mr.
Purdie
would
read
us
excerpts
from
books
filled
with
colorful
descriptions,
asking
us
to
pick
out
words
which
represented
the
five
senses.
Every
day,
we
wrote
a
journal
entry,
a
minimum
of
one
page
in
length;
the
prompts
for
these
entries
would
be
to
describe
something,
such
as
a
favorite
pair
of
shoes
or
a
messy
room.
On
occasion,
Mr.
Purdie
would
pick
a
couple
especially
good
entries
to
read
to
the
class,
never
telling
the
class
who
had
written
the
works.
One
of
my
best
experiences
was
sitting
quietly
at
my
desk
as
he
read
something
of
mine,
knowing
that
he
was
reading
something
I
had
written
because
it
was
"good".
In
sixth
grade,
I
learned
to
enjoy
creative
writing
assignments.
My
teacher
thought
that
I
wrote
well
and
the
few
friends
I
allowed
to
read
my
writing
agreed
with
his
comments.
Receiving
supportive
comments
or
glowing
compliments
of
my
work
boosted
my
confidence
in
my
writing
ability.
Through
creative
writing
in
sixth
grade,
I
learned
to
love
description
and
started
filling
all
my
writing
with
as
much
of
it
as
I
could.
In
seventh
and
eighth
grade,
the
school
I
attended
required
"writing
across
the
curriculum,"
meaning
writing
in
all
areas
of
learning.
There
were
written
reports
required
in
English,
science
and
even
P.
E.
My
math
teachers
assigned
Problems
of
the
Week.
Once
a
week,
a
math
word
problem
was
assigned;
the
solutions
had
to
include
a
restatement
of
the
problem,
an
outline
of
how
to
solve
the
problem,
and
the
math
and
the
work
required
to
reach
the
answer.
At
first,
writing
these
papers
was
a
struggle
because
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
translate
the
steps
to
solving
a
problem
and
the
math
techniques
from
symbols
and
numbers
into
words.
With
practice,
I
was
better
able
to
write
out
what
the
math
was
accomplishing.
In
teaching
me
to
present
something
mathematical
with
words,
these
assignments
helped
me
improve
my
ability
to
explain
math,
both
to
myself
and
to
others.
I
could
better
understand
the
point
and
practical
applications
of
the
math
I
was
learning
because
it
seemed
more
logically
connected
with
everyday
life
and
more
worthwhile
to
learn.
Two
projects
in
eighth
grade
were
important
to
my
life
as
a
writer.
In
March
of
my
eighth
grade
year,
I
and
most
of
the
students
in
my
grade
went
on
a
school
sponsored
trip
to
Yosemite
National
Park
for
a
week
to
attend
the
Yosemite
Institute,
a
program
for
junior
high
school
students
to
learn
more
about
nature
and
the
natural
world
through
hands-on
experience.
While
we
were
there,
we
went
hiking
in
small
groups,
had
mess
hall
duties,
and,
most
importantly,
kept
a
journal
of
our
trip.
We
had
to
write
an
entry
for
each
day,
recounting
what
we
had
learned
that
day,
where
we
had
gone,
and
our
reactions.
The
journals
were
small
notebooks
of
approximately
twenty
pages
each,
and
each
student
had
to
turn
in
their
journal
to
their
English
teacher
upon
returning
from
the
trip.
When
the
notebooks
were
handed
out,
the
head
of
the
program
explained
the
assignment
to
the
students
and
said
that,
if
needed,
additional
journals
would
be
available.
I
returned
from
Yosemite
with
three
full
notebooks.
I
had
written
about
everything
I
could
think
of,
describing
all
I
saw
as
well
as
I
could.
My
English
teacher
and
the
head
of
the
Yosemite
trip
program
were
impressed
with
my
journals,
and
as
a
result,
a
copy
of
a
few
of
my
journal
entries
are
now
shown
to
new
students
in
preparation
for
the
Yosemite
trip
as
an
example.
I
felt
proud
that
something
I
had
written
was
recognized
and
useful
to
someone
else.
The
second
eighth
grade
project
was
a
research
assignment
which
resulted
in
the
creation
of
a
magazine,
complete
with
editorials,
diagrams,
an
interview,
and
a
political
cartoon.
For
my
subject,
I
chose
the
depletion
of
the
ozone
layer.
At
first,
it
seemed
like
a
very
daunting
task
because
there
was
so
much
material
to
look
through
and
absorb.
This
project
differed
from
other
research
projects
I
had
done
because
ozone
depletion
was
much
more
technical
and
little
information
was
available
in
an
encyclopedia;
most
up-to-date
information
was
to
be
found
in
scientific
magazines.
Over
the
course
of
my
project,
I
wrote
up
questions
and
arranged
an
interview
with
a
scientist
at
NASA.
The
scientist
worked
with
computer
software
that
analyzed
samples
from
the
ozone
layer
and
monitored
levels
of
toxins.
Through
this
project,
not
only
did
I
learn
a
great
deal
about
the
chemical
make-up
of
ozone
and
the
toxins
destroying
ozone,
but
I
also
learned
interviewing
skills
and
further
developed
my
skills
in
writing
a
research
paper.
Tenth
grade
held
further
adventures
in
creative
writing
for
me.
I
took
a
Creative
Writing
class
in
which
the
teacher
introduced
us
to
the
technical
aspects
of
a
story
as
well
as
the
style
and
unique
parts
the
writer
himself
puts
into
the
story.
My
teacher
elaborated
on
the
witch's
hat
plot
diagram
first
seen
in
third
grade,
explaining
and
redefining
some
parts
of
the
diagram.
We
read
a
number
of
short
stories
to
see
how
other
writers
had
chosen
to
use
the
plot
diagram
and
the
benefits
of
such
methods.
For
each
unit
we
learned
about,
we
wrote
our
own
stories.
The
aspect
I
liked
best
about
the
course,
next
to
simply
writing
the
stories
and
the
creativity
in
that
which
I
adored,
was
the
process
of
writing
drafts
and
having
my
work
peer
edited.
This
was
an
odd
thing
for
me,
considering
my
overall
dislike
of
and
lack
of
faith
in
the
system
of
peer
editing.
However,
in
this
course,
all
the
students
seemed
to
be
afraid
of
the
same
thing
I
was
-
that
someone
wouldn't
like
their
work
and
would
tear
it
to
pieces.
Even
the
jocks
and
the
tough
students
who
were
seemingly
afraid
of
nothing
were
not
entirely
comfortable
with
having
someone
other
than
the
teacher
critiquing
their
paper.
I
actually
felt
more
at
ease
with
the
process
because
of
this
shared
fear.
I
expected
my
fellow
students
would
be
more
tactful
and
kind
while
still
trying
to
be
honest.
In
reality,
I
found
that
students
were
too
kind,
almost
so
kind
as
to
not
be
at
all
helpful,
making
the
whole
process
pointless.
I
learned
more
about
writing
short
stories
and
the
techniques
involved
as
well
as
more
about
myself
and
the
give-and-take
involved
in
the
peer
editing
process.
I
still
did
not
like
the
process
very
much
and
did
not
believe
it
to
be
entirely
useful.
Another
aspect
of
tenth
grade
which
influenced
me
was
my
world
history
teacher's
writing
requirements.
Mr.
Mann
believed
that
the
introductory
paragraph
of
any
essay
should
consist
of
five
carefully
drafted
sentences
which
held
all
the
basic
information
in
its
most
distilled
form.
Who,
what,
when,
where,
and
how
were
all
to
be
answered
in
this
paragraph,
to
be
further
explained
in
the
three
body
paragraphs
and
then
restated
in
the
concluding
paragraph.
This
process
of
writing
was
the
most
challenging
for
me
because
I
had
to
cut
down
on
all
the
description
I
was
accustomed
to
including.
I
could
not
include
all
the
interesting
details
I
had
at
my
fingertips;
instead,
I
had
to
stick
to
just
the
facts
and
pertinent
details,
ignoring
many
things
which
seemed
to
me
to
give
character
and
life
to
the
history,
to
make
the
history
more
than
dry
and
dull
dates.
Still,
Mr.
Mann's
requirements
taught
me
the
beginnings
of
editing,
how
to
cut
out
details
which
I
thought
were
important
but
that
might
not
be
as
necessary
to
a
basic
understanding
of
the
subject.
I
learned
how
to
structure
a
tight
five-sentence
paragraph
and
a
five-paragraph
essay.
Although
I
didn't
particularly
enjoy
the
process,
what
I
learned
was
valuable.
During
my
junior
year,
I
took
a
course
entitled
Writing
For
College,
which
was
intended
to
introduce
students
to
various
types
of
papers
and
explain
how
to
write
them.
I
loved
writing
essays,
appreciating
the
structure
of
the
paper
and
the
orderliness
the
form
gave
me.
I
returned
to
including
more
details
in
my
papers
than
my
writings
for
Mr.
Mann
had
allowed.
Writing
essays
took
less
time
than
writing
stories
and
involved
a
different
sort
of
creativity.
However,
I
was
often
frustrated
because
the
students
who
read
my
paper
would
only
make
comments
about
punctuation.
The
peer
reader
would
write
their
comments
on
the
back
of
the
final
page
of
the
paper,
noting
that
maybe
there
should
be
a
paragraph
change
here,
a
comma
there,
and
then
conclude
that
the
paper
was
"good"
or
"needed
work",
without
further
explanation.
When
I
would
ask
for
specifics,
often
they
couldn't
explain
why
they
felt
the
way
they
did
about
the
paper.
More
disappointing,
I
found
myself
doing
the
same
to
other
people's
papers.
I
gradually
learned
that
it
might
not
hurt
to
explain
my
comments
and
to
hope
that
others
would
do
the
same,
or
persistently
ask
them
to
do
so.
As
a
senior,
I
began
to
wonder
if
my
classes
were
preparing
me
for
college.
I
had
heard
stories
about
college
classes
from
my
older
friends:
I
had
heard
that
grades
depended
upon
a
few
papers,
professors
didn't
offer
much
help
on
rough
drafts
or
brainstorming,
and
often
graduate
students
rather
than
the
professor
graded
the
papers.
One
course,
in
my
senior
year
of
high
school,
was
taught
differently
than
others
I
had
taken
and
I
think
best
prepared
me
for
college
classes.
In
my
British
Literature
class,
there
were
no
quizzes,
multiple-choice
tests,
group
projects,
or
extra
credit;
my
grades
were
based
on
some
participation
points
and
four
required
papers.
These
papers
were
more
challenging
than
assignments
I
had
been
given
in
previous
classes.
In
one
paper,
we
were
asked
to
compare
values
in
Celtic
and
Anglo-Saxon
societies
as
presented
through
sample
literature
from
both
societies.
In
another
assignment,
we
had
to
create
ten
modern-day
pilgrims
and
described
them
in
the
style
of
Chaucer's
Canterbury
Tales.
A
third
paper
required
us
to
analyze
one
of
Shakespeare's
sonnets
on
the
basis
of
several
areas,
including
style
and
symbolism.
These
papers
required
more
thought
and
planning
than
other
writing
assignments.
It
also
required
creativity
in
presentation
in
order
to
make
the
papers
interesting
and
entertaining
to
read
as
well
as
informative.
Another
aspect
of
the
class
that
prepared
me
for
college
was
the
independence
the
teacher
gave
us
and
the
self-motivation
she
expected.
My
teacher
gave
us
a
lot
of
reading
and
we
spent
most
of
the
class
period
discussing
in
depth
what
we
had
read.
The
teacher
didn't
check
to
make
sure
we
were
doing
our
work
along
the
way,
collecting
rough
drafts
or
outlines;
instead,
we
were
asked
to
prepare
these
and
bring
them
to
class
to
ask
any
questions
and
have
other
students
look
over
our
work.
It
was
a
different
kind
of
class
for
me
and
required
me
to
be
more
organized.
While
it
may
not
have
been
everything
that
college
English
classes
have
turned
out
to
be,
British
Literature
taught
me
a
great
deal
about
what
I
might
expect
and
how
I
would
best
learn
and
write.
The
college
course
which
has
most
influenced
me
so
far
was
my
second
semester
College
Writing
course.
The
papers
we
were
asked
to
write
were
as
complicated
as
any
I
had
written
before,
but
the
professor
expected
even
more
motivation
on
the
student's
part.
For
one
of
our
papers,
the
professor
left
it
up
to
each
student
to
decide
what
to
write
about,
providing
sample
prompts
but
expecting
students
to
choose
a
subject
for
themselves;
while
this
made
writing
the
paper
more
difficult
because
I
had
to
create
a
question
to
evaluate
before
I
could
get
started,
the
paper
was
more
interesting
to
write
because
I
was
allowed
to
choose
for
myself
what
I
wanted
to
write
about
and
how
to
structure
my
paper.
While
my
professor
did
sometimes
collect
our
rough
drafts,
if
I
had
any
questions
or
wanted
the
professor's
input
I
had
to
find
the
professor
during
office
hours
and
know
exactly
what
I
was
asking.
Gone
were
the
days
when
the
teacher
would
kindly
look
over
the
entire
essay
and
proofread
it
as
well
as
checking
for
content
and
flow.
Now,
my
professor
expected
me
to
proofread
on
my
own
and
to
come
with
specific
difficulties.
Other
important
things
I
learned
from
my
College
Writing
course
were
about
writing
in
general.
Previously,
I
had
not
given
much
thought
to
any
cliches
or
hyperbole
that
might
appear
in
my
papers.
I
had
to
learn
to
identify
these
aspects
in
my
writing,
an
activity
which
required
that
I
learn
to
read
my
own
papers
more
closely,
looking
not
just
at
the
paper
overall
but
at
the
words
and
phrases
themselves.
These
last
skills,
as
well
as
others
I
have
developed
over
time,
I
expect
will
come
in
handy
in
my
work
as
a
writing
associate
and
with
my
own
writing.
I
can
remember
how
uncomfortable
I
felt
having
anyone,
especially
someone
my
age,
read
my
work;
knowing
how
I
felt
and
now
realizing
that
it
is
possibly
a
universal
feeling
helps
me
to
anticipate
another
writer's
reactions
and
relate
to
other
students.
I
have
also
learned,
from
reflecting
on
my
writing
history,
conditions
in
which
I
best
enjoyed
writing
and
in
which
I
felt
most
productive.
When
a
teacher
or
fellow
student
looked
at
what
I
had
written
and
cited
portions
that
disturbed
the
flow
of
the
paper
or
somehow
stood
out
for
good
or
bad
reasons,
I
knew
where
to
start
making
corrections,
changes,
and
improvements.
When
someone
read
something
I
had
written
and
explained
why
they
reacted
this
way,
even
if
their
reasoning
hung
only
on
a
certain
phrase
or
feeling,
it
was
more
helpful
and
a
better
experience
than
having
someone
go
through
my
paper
with
red
pen
and
mark
grammar
and
spelling
mistakes.
Having
a
reader
ask
about
my
purpose
for
the
paper
or
ask
what
I
was
trying
to
accomplish
helped
me
return
to
the
assignment
with
a
question
in
mind
that
would
enable
me
to
self-correct
and
make
my
writing
clearer.
All
of
my
experiences,
including
the
composing
of
this
paper
on
my
personal
writing
history,
are
steps
in
my
development
as
a
writer.
