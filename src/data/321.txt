The
History
of
the
World
According
to
Liza,
Part
One
There's
a
photograph
in
one
of
our
family
albums
of
my
twin
brother's
first
example
of
writing.
He
wrote
the
words
ZZ
Top
on
a
playskool
chalkboard
we
both
shared.
See,
my
brother
sort
of
fit
the
prototype
of
one
of
those
child
prodigy
geniuses
who
could
read
before
school,
prepre-school
if
you
will.
He
was
only
two
at
the
time
the
photograph
was
taken,
smiling
knowingly
at
the
camera,
with
the
purple
chalk
in
his
hand
and
the
early
versions
of
MTV
videos
on
the
television
set.
I
guess
I
was
more
of
the
average
child
of
the
twinset
at
first
glance,
since
I
myself
didn't
start
reading
and
writing
until
age
three.
My
mom
saved
just
about
everything
I
ever
wrote.
I
don't
know
why,
but
my
theory
is
that
some
angel
or
weird
time
traveler
from
the
future
stopped
my
mom
on
the
street
one
day
and
said,
"Liza
will
need
to
write
a
seven
page
essay
detailing
the
history
of
her
writing.
If
you
save
it,
she
will
write!!"
So
there
are
several
huge
white
cardboard
boxes
stacked
in
our
otherwise
useless
attic
that
have
"Liza's
Stuff'
scrawled
in
black
magic
marker
on
them.
{Liza's
stuff?
Jeez,
couldn't
my
mom
have
thought
of
something
a
little
more
eloquent?
We're
talking
about
a
whole
history
here!!
Oh
well.)
I
used
to
rifle
through
those
boxes
every
now
and
then,
reminiscing
about
elementary
school
teachers
and
assignments
and
projects
and
games
my
brother
and
sister
and
I
used
to
play.
In
one
of
the
boxes,
there's
this
paper
from
my
kindergarten
class.
The
assignment
was
one
like
many
we
had
gotten
in
the
class
each
week
-
a
color-by-number.
We
had
to
use
a
crayon
to
discover
the
secret
shape
inside
the
puzzle,
and
then
write
a
few
words
about
the
picture
we
revealed.
Each
week
it
was
a
different
shape
and
a
new
color-
a
red
heart,
a
blue
ball,
etc.
I
always
worked
hard,
coloring
within
the
lines
and
really
thinking
about
interesting
words
I
could
write
to
describe
the
shape.
This
was
my
first
experience
with
descriptive
adjectives!
And
every
week
my
teacher
Mrs.
Heidelberger
would
return
my
paper
with
the
red
inked
"GOOD!"
on
the
top.
That
word
made
me
so
happy,
until
I
would
look
over
at
my
twin
brother's
page.
"EXCELLENT!"
Always!
Always
an
"EXCELLENT!,"
and
I
always
had
a
"GOOD!"
I
tried
and
tried
and
tried,
generating
the
most
creative
and
sassy
description
words
my
little
five
year
old
brain
could
muster.
But
I
never
lived
up
to
my
brother.
One
day,
in
the
last
month
of
school
or
so,
I
was
running
out
of
time.
I
was
determined
to
get
the
coveted
"EXCELLENT,"
so
I
put
my
best-ever
effort
forth.
I
pressed
that
fat
yellow
crayon
so
hard,
and
I
brainstormed
for
creative
adjectives
for
the
yellow
star
that
appeared
on
my
color
by
number
puzzle.
I
handed
in
my
paper
with
a
knot
in
my
stomach
and
my
fingers
crossed.
"Shining,
bright,
pretty,
sparkling"
-
pretty
good
words
for
a
five
year
old,
right?
No,
EXCELLENT
words.
I
thought
so
anyway.
And
sure
enough,
so
did
my
teacher.
I
got
my
paper
back
and
there
it
was,
a
energetic
cursive
"EXCELLENT!"
in
red
ink.
My
teacher's
fine
papery
skin
crinkled
into
a
wink
when
she
handed
it
out
to
me.
I
almost
cried
I
was
so
happy.
I
looked
over
at
my
brother's
paper
expecting
to
see
a
matching
EXCELLENT,
finally,
but
instead
of
smiling
contentedly,
I
made
a
loud
yelping
kind
of
a
sound.
A
new
word,
one
I'd
never
seen
before,
graced
the
top
of
Andrew's
page.
"MARVELOUS"
it
said
in
a
wavy
elegant
banner
of
red
ink.
I
couldn't
believe
it.
Oh
well.
That
taught
me
to
forget
about
competing
with
my
brother,
or
anyone
for
that
matter,
and
just
concentrate
on
my
own
writing.
I
loved
writing,
and
comparing
myself
to
Andrew
wasn't
going
to
take
that
away
from
me.
I
wrote
tons
of
stories
and
poems
whenever
I
had
spare
time
-
for
the
longest
time,
my
answer
to
the
"when
you
grow
up"
question
was
an
author.
My
second
grade
teacher,
whose
curriculum
was
heavily
steeped
in
expression
and
communication,
really
fostered
my
interest
in
writing.
Mrs.
Zanetti,
a
good
old
Italian
red
head,
would
have
us
create
our
own
books,
all
of
which
I
still
have
saved
in
the
boxes.
Each
one
is
based
on
a
theme,
with
titles
like
"The
Seasons
of
the
Year,"
or
"All
About
Manners,"
or
"All
About
Me."
We
were
required
to
illustrate
them
and
provide
our
own
personal
anecdotes
or
opinions.
It
was
great.
I
think
we
did
about
one
book
a
month,
and
it
was
always
my
favorite
part
of
the
curriculum.
The
visionary
Mrs.
Zanetti
also
fostered
creative
writing
in
another
way.
For
extra
credit,
we
could
leaf
through
pictures
from
magazines,
cut
them
out,
paste
them
onto
a
sheet
of
lined
paper,
and
then
build
a
story
around
them.
We
could
interpret
the
picture
any
way
we
wanted.
So
maybe
I
was
a
bit
losery
and
did
the
extra
credit
more
often
than
I
needed,
but
telling
stories
was
fun
for
me,
so
I
did
the
projects.
A
lot.
And
I
kept
every
one
of
them.
I
think
that
my
imagination
got
a
lot
of
exercise
that
year,
and
it's
been
strong
ever
since.
In
third
grade,
my
dream
of
being
writer
got
slightly
skewed.
I
now
wanted
to
be
a
singer/songwriter.
I
still
wanted
to
write,
but
now
I
wanted
some
extra
added
glory.
(Ahhh,
the
American
dream
at
such
a
young
age....)
So
I
started
collecting
my
songs
in
a
black
and
white
marble
composition
book.
It
has
the
most
hilarious
lyrics
in
it;
for
example,
"Too
much
of
me,
Too
much
of
You,
that's
too
much
of
what
we
can't
do,
just
rocking,
oh-oh-oh
just
rolling."
But
I
was
self-expressing,
and
it
was
healthy.
Writing
always
calmed
me
down.
My
first
experience
with
writing
about
literature,
I
mean
really
writing
intelligently
about
real
literature,
occurred
in
fourth
grade.
We
read
The
Twenty-
One
Balloons
in
a
reading
enrichment
group
of
which
I
was
a
member.
The
teacher
assigned
us
wonderful
projects
relating
to
the
book;
we
had
to
illustrate,
elaborate,
associate,
and
postulate.
We
were
assigned
to
be
reporters
to
write
a
news
article
about
the
events
in
the
book.
We
were
assigned
to
be
co-authors
and
create
a
new
character
for
the
adventures.
We
had
to
design
our
own
advertisement
for
the
book.
Project
after
project,
it
was
fantastic.
I'd
never
before
read
a
book
in
such
detail,
with
such
activity.
I
remember
seeing
my
marking
period
evaluation
from
that
teacher
that
year,
and
how
her
comments
said
in
this
very
sophisticated
cursive,
"Liza
has
a
flair
for
writing."
That
impressed
me,
I
guess
because
it
was
the
first
time
I
had
heard
such
praise
for
something
I
loved
to
do
so
much.
That
little
evaluation
gave
me
the
security
my
little
10
year
old
mind
needed
to
keep
writing,
to
keep
daring
to
put
my
feelings
down
on
paper.
Something
happened
in
fourth
grade
with
another
teacher
that
could
have
turned
me
off
to
writing
forever.
She,
(and
the
rest
of
the
world
for
that
matter,
hee
hee,)
is
damn
lucky
it
didn't,
but
her
irresponsibility
caused
us
fourth
graders
a
lot
of
heartache
that
year.
Mrs.
Carlberg
was
her
name,
and
whatever
good
ideas
she
had
throughout
the
year
were
always
tainted
by
lack
of
follow-through.
The
classic
example
was
the
fourth
grade
newspaper.
It
was
1990,
and
she
announced
that
to
celebrate
the
new
decade,
we
were
to
put
out
a
news-magazine
type
of
publication
encapsulating
the
year,
and
the
decade
past,
to
be
handed
out
at
Promotion.
We
never
worked
so
hard
on
anything
in
our
lives.
We
stayed
after
school,
thinking
of
story
ideas
and
organization
techniques,
assigning
artwork
and
articles.
I
was
the
Lifestyles
editor,
in
charge
of
entertainment,
TV,
music,
books,
fads,
and
trends.
My
personal
article
was
on
the
Simpsons,
which
had
just
come
out.
(See
what
vision
I
had?)
My
brother
was
the
sports
editor,
and
worked
hard
on
a
piece
about
the
1986
Mets
World
Series.
Anyway,
to
make
a
long
heartbreaking
story
shorter,
we
worked
our
butts
off
for
six
months
and
then
handed
the
work
to
Mrs.
Carlberg
to
get
printed,
and
to
this
day
I
am
still
waiting
for
the
fruits
of
our
efforts.
She
never
printed
it!!!
I
hated
her
for
that.
But
luckily
I
was
still
riding
high
off
the
"Liza
has
a
flair
for
writing"
comment
that
I
didn't
let
Mrs.
Carlberg's
traumatic
experience
scar
me.
Since
I
loved
to
read
so
much,
book
reports
stand
out
in
my
mind
as
far
as
writing
assignments
go.
Book
reports
were
big
items
for
my
5th
through
8th
grade
years,
and
I
remember
every
book
I
read
and
every
book
I
chose
to
report
on.
Ok,
well
maybe
I
just
remember
because
all
my
reports
are
carefully
stowed
away
in
those
cardboard
boxes.
But
I
did
love
to
read
and
had
so
much
fun
creating
book
reports
about
each
new
book
I
read.
To
answer
the
question
that
you
are
thinking
right
now,
yes,
I
was
definitely
a
dork,
there's
no
question.
My
favorite
presents
at
Christmas
time
were
always
the
books
the
Santa
left
me.
The
newest
American
Girls
collection
(you
know,
Meet
Molly
and
Meet
Samantha
and
Kirsten
Saves
the
Day!
and
all
that
bullshit,
remember
them?),
a
new
Babysitters
Club
set,
Nancy
Drew,
Sweet
Valley
High,
the
newest
Newbury
award
book.
I
was
hooked.
And
writing
about
them
seemed
only
natural.
I
really
didn't
mind
book
reports.
I
actually
liked
them.
Honestly!
Yep,
dork.
As
a
rule,
I
don't
really
talk
about
the
middle
school
years
much.
Too
painful....
Bergenfield
High
School
was
good
to
me.
I
had
good
teachers
who
put
writing
high
on
the
list
of
priorities
for
learning,
which
was
great
for
me
because
that
was
my
talent,
(or
should
I
say
flair?)
Dr.
Engsberg
was
my
freshman
honors
English
teacher,
and
he
reorganized
my
perspective
about
my
writing.
He
basically
crushed
all
my
dreams
of
being
a
writer.
He
said
to
the
whole
class
on
the
first
day
of
school,
"If
you
were
meant
to
be
a
writer,
you'd
be
doing
it
already."
He
articulated
the
words
so
it
sounded
like
this:
yewdah
(pause)
b-he
(pause)
dew-ingah-//ah
(pause)...
(pause)..
.{dramatic
pause)...
aaaaal-red-ee.
This
scared
the
crap
out
of
me!
I
mean,
yes,
I
wrote
everyday
and
I
knew
I
had
a
talent,
but
I
surely
wasn't
producing
masterpieces
at
age
14.
I
know
Keats
did
that,
but
jeez-
did
the
guy
have
to
dash
all
our
hopes
for
the
future
on
the
first
day
of
highschool?
Anyway,
I
was
definitely
discouraged
about
creative
writing.
But
my
essays
for
Dr.
Engsberg,
well
-
they
were
in
a
league
of
their
own.
My
first
real
literary
essays
came
from
that
class-
and
I
had
found
what
I
had
a
knack
for.
My
first
analysis
was
about
the
short
story,
"The
Necklace."
I
remember
how
simple
he
made
it
sound.
"Write
a
good
introduction,
with
an
argument
in
the
first
sentence
and
five
more
sentences
that
tell
a
reason
why
your
argument
is
right.
Then,
use
your
introduction
like
an
outline
to
finish
the
paper."
I
turned
in
an
essay
that
was
seven
paragraphs
long
--
an
intro,
five
supporting
paragraphs,
and
a
conclusion.
The
comments
on
my
returned
paper?
"Near
perfect
organization
and
structure,
great
argument,
good
support,
A+."
WHO
AH--my
first
try
and
it's
near-perfect??
A
far
cry
from
my
struggle
with
Mrs.
Heidelberger.
I
liked
this
guy,
and
I
liked
this
new
genre
of
writing
-
literary
analysis!
Not
every
paper
came
that
easily
I'll
admit,
but
I
definitely
enjoyed
literature
enough
to
really
apply
myself
when
it
came
to
writing
essays.
I
also
got
involved
by
chance,
lucky
for
me,
with
a
high
school
journalism
program
that
is
tops
in
the
nation.
BHS's
Bear
Facts
was
the
number
one
newspaper
in
the
state,
and
ranked
pretty
high
in
national
contests.
I
wanted
to
be
a
part
of
it,
but
getting
on
staff
was
so
exclusive
that
students
first
had
to
take
a
freshman
course
in
journalism,
earn
an
A
in
that
and
then
join
the
staff
as
a
reporter
as
a
sophomore.
Fortunately,
I
took
the
right
steps
and
was
Editor
in
Chief
by
the
time
I
was
a
junior.
Writing
the
stories,
coming
up
with
ideas,
laying
out
the
pages
in
daring
graphic
designs,
editing
everyone's
work-
it
all
came
with
the
job,
and
the
job
was
just
something
that
I
was
really
good
at.
Okay,
my
conscience
is
screaming
at
me.
I
was
co-editor
in
chief.
There
was
another
girl,
Nancy,
who,
uh,
helped
me
out.
Ok,
she
did
as
much
work
as
I
did.
But
the
real
reason
I
mention
her
anyway
is
to
mention
the
fact
that
I
really
hit
it
off
with
Nancy.
We
worked
so
well
together.
We
weren't
afraid
to
question
each
other's
decisions,
and
what
resulted
was
usually
a
better
story,
a
better
idea,
a
better
page.
We
both
decided,
you
see,
on
different
but
equally
important
primary
objectives
for
the
paper.
I
said,
Nancy,
the
most
important
thing
we
should
be
doing
is
Entertaining
our
reader.
It's
a
highschool
newspaper!
Our
audience
members
are
young
impressionable
highschool
students!
She
said,
Liza,
the
most
important
thing
we
should
be
doing
is
Informing
our
reader.
It's
a
high
school
newspaper!
Our
audience
members
are
young
impressionable
highschool
students!
Well,
it
was
a
beautiful
balance.
We
got
our
facts
straight,
we
provided
useful
information,
and
made
it
fun
and
accessible
to
our
audience.
That's
why
we
continued
to
be
one
of
the
best
newspapers
in
the
country.
Time
warp,
fast
forward
to:
Highschool
graduation,
where
I
wrote
and
delivered
a
speech
for
the
ceremony.
It
was
special
and
I
will
never
forget
it,
but
sometimes
I
wish
I
could
go
back
and
do
it
again.
My
English
teacher
turned
my
accessible
fun
speech
into
something
worthy
of
an
intense
political
campaign.
It
was
technically
an
excellent
speech,
but
not
something
I
would
have
wanted
to
give
to
my
highschool
peers.
I
did
managed
to
throw
in
some
references
to
great
lyrics
of
rock
and
roll,
to
which
the
students
responded
eagerly.
I
was
slowly
learning
-
audience
appeal
is
foremost
in
writing.
WELCOME
TO
LAFAYETTE
COLLEGE!
I
pretty
much
decided
right
away
that
I
would
be
an
English
major.
My
classes
in
this
subject
are
my
favorite
at
Lafayette.
I've
written
so
many
essays
and
papers
on
literature
and
drama
that
I
lost
count.
But
two
classes
stand
out
in
my
mind
as
really
shaping
the
way
I
write.
One
was
Creative
Writing,
which
fired
within
me
a
love
for
writing
poetry
that
I
had
never
before
uncovered.
I
still
write
poetry
everyday
and
have
since
shaken
Dr.
Engsberg's
prediction
that
I
could
never
be
a
writer.
It
is
now
a
goal
of
mine
to
one
day
get
my
MFA
in
Creative
writing
and
maybe
even
publish
a
book
or
two
of
poems.
Another
was
my
modem
drama
class,
which
combined
my
love
of
theater
with
my
love
for
writing.
I
had
never
before
written
so
intensely
about
plays
and
the
theater,
and
I
think
this
class
gave
me
a
new
avenue
to
think
about
for
my
future:
I
think
eventually
I
will
get
a
Phd
in
Drama
and
Theater.
But
my
first
exposure
to
college
writing
had
just
as
much
influence
on
my
future
as
these
other
classes
did.
The
first
class
I
ever
took
was
my
First
Year
Seminar.
My
topic
was
"Myths
of
Masculinity,"
and
my
final
project
was
something
of
which
I
am
still
very
proud.
We
had
to
choose
an
ancient
male
mythical
figure
and
write
an
essay
connecting
it
to
a
pop
culture
retelling
of
the
myth.
I
chose
the
film
Jerry
Maguire
as
a
modem
Neptune
myth,
and
it
was
a
great
essay.
In
fact,
the
connection
of
mythology
to
pop
culture
excited
me
so
much
that
I
plan
to
explore
mythological
approaches
to
drama/
literature
throughout
different
periods
and
regions,
specifically
looking
at
similarities
and
differences
in
the
ways
females
are
represented.
I
will
explore
the
mythological
images
relating
to
women
that
recur
in
drama
and
literature.
Myths
and
archetypes
of
the
mother,
the
virgin,
the
seductress,
the
saint,
the
sinner,
the
lover,
etc,
might
all
be
explored.
I
will
read
many
plays
and
texts
across
many
genres
and
time
periods,
possibly
including
ancient
texts
of
Greek,
Roman,
Native
American,
West
African,
Egyptian,
Northern
European
and
Eastern
mythological
tales,
and
try
to
locate
retellings
of
these
myths
throughout
time.
After
this
preliminary
research,
I
hope
to
have
a
general
knowledge
of
the
woman
portrayed
in
theater
through
myth,
and
have
a
basis
for
selecting
a
specific
myth
or
topic
for
the
next
portion
of
my
thesis.
Part
One
will
perhaps
yield
the
introductory
chapters
of
my
thesis.
Based
on
my
findings
in
part
one,
I
hope
to
find
a
common
image
or
myth
that
is
retold
in
many
ages
of
drama
or
literature.
I
would
like
to
create
an
argument
based
on
these
findings
to
be
presented
in
an
analytical
paper.
An
example
something
I
might
do
would
be
to
study
the
myth
of
Medea,
and
show
the
connections
between
the
Greek
and
Roman
dramatic
tellings
of
Medea,
and
the
contemporary
retellings
in
Beloved
and
the
American
musical
Marie
Christine.
The
Medea
myth
is
just
on
example;
hundreds
of
myths
exist
and
are
retold
throughout
time
in
different
forms
and
characters.
My
goal
is
to
find
one
that
sparks
my
interest
and
to
read
and
analyze
all
the
different
forms
it
has
taken
on
throughout
time.
My
third
and
final
part
of
my
thesis
will
be
an
original
play
that
is
a
contemporary
retelling
of
the
myth
on
which
I
chose
to
concentrate
in
part
two
of
my
thesis.
I
will
include
issues
that
are
specific
to
my
generation
of
women
but
also
reflect
inherent
universal
similarities
of
all
woman
everywhere.
For
example,
I
might
use
abortion
as
an
issue
to
reflect
Medea's
killing
of
her
children
in
a
modem
way.
I
hope
I
will
push
the
boundaries
of
traditional
drama
using
a
very
poetical
and
imagistic
approach
to
writing
the
script.
I
am
very
excited
about
my
thesis
and
can't
wait
to
make
a
mark
on
the
scholarly
world,
to
achieve
some
immortality
on
the
scope
of
theater.
Aside
from
academic
work,
writing
has
helped
me
through
a
lot
of
hard
times.
Last
semester,
when
I
was
struggling
with
depression
and
an
eating
disorder,
writing
was
therapy
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
word.
I
will
treasure
the
outlet
it
gave
me,
the
poems
that
helped
me
connect
with
what
I
was
feeling
deep
down
inside.
So
looking
back,
even
if
I
don't
pass
my
thesis
defense
and
make
a
mark
on
the
Lafayette
English
Department
let
alone
the
whole
scholarly
world,
I
cherish
the
words
that
have
guided
me
through
life.
I
have
always
written,
and
in
a
way
I
have
my
own
sort
of
immortality
stuffed
into
those
cardboard
boxes
and
journals
and
songs
and
poems.
