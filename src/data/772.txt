Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative
Reflect
on
your
experience
working
for
the
College
Writing
Program
over
the
last
year,
and
consider
how
the
experience
has
shaped
your
relationship
to
writing
and
your
interactions
with
other
writers.
You
can
tell
a
lot
about
a
person
by
their
rough
drafts.
In
reading
over
the
outlines,
partial
paragraphs,
and
final
copies
of
the
work
of
my
FYS
students
in
the
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
before
our
conferences
last
year
I
would
get
to
know
them
before
even
meeting
them.
Through
their
papers,
I
was
not
only
exposed
to
my
studentsu
opinions,
arguments,
and
thought
processes
but
I
could
see
how
they
approached
their
work.
Did
they
read
over
their
essays
before
they
handed
them
in?
Were
they
in
a
rush?
Had
they
thought
about
their
ideas
before
they
began
to
write?
Did
they
make
an
outline?
Often,
I
didnut
even
have
to
ask
these
questions
because
the
answers
were
already
on
the
page.
rIum
not
a
very
good
writeris
many
of
my
students
would
start
by
saying
when
they
arrived.
They
would
sit
across
from
me
in
Skillman
Caf#
a
bit
apprehensively,
as
First
Years
usually
are,
unsure
of
what
exactly
a
WA
was
or
how
to
initiate
a
peer
conference.
I
soon
began
to
realize
that
the
College
Writing
Program
was
much
more
than
just
reading
another
studentus
essay
and
checking
it
for
punctuation
as
I
had
originally
thought.
Writing,
it
soon
became
clear,
is
actually
very
personal
and
as
a
result
critiquing
it,
discussing
it,
and
editing
it
is
also
personal.
rDonut
be
so
hard
on
yourself,
lets
take
a
look
at
what
you
wrote,s
I
would
respond.
One
of
the
things
about
being
a
WA
that
surprised
me
the
most
was
how
difficult
it
was.
Sometimes
it
seemed
that
it
would
almost
be
easier
to
return
the
studentus
work
covered
in
red
marks,
reworked
and
adjusted
to
sound
just
right.
rJust
correct
these
mistakes
and
add
my
name
to
the
by-line,s
I
could
say
and
the
conference
would
be
over.
But,
after
meeting
with
a
few
students
I
began
to
realize
that
it
was
not
the
essay
that
mattered
but
the
writer
and
their
process
especially
if
their
work
was
going
to
get
better
over
the
course
of
the
semester.
Giving
constructive
criticism
and
making
critical
adjustments,
it
turned
out,
was
not
always
easy
especially
because
it
was
so
personal
and
so
much
of
the
student
was
exposed
in
their
writing.
What
do
you
say?
Helping
the
student
and
not
just
the
essay
proved
to
be
more
difficult
than
I
had
anticipated
when
I
first
signed
up
to
become
a
WA.
In
our
weekly
meetings
as
a
WA
staff
we
would
talk
about
these
central
problems
and
learn
different
ways
to
approach
a
WA
conference.
While
it
was
always
helpful
to
listen
to
other
WAs
and
their
experiences,
learning
about
different
techniques
for
holding
an
effective
conference
could
get
theoretical
and
in
practice,
I
found,
giving
constructive
criticism
was
always
more
difficult.
Over
time
I
found
that
certain
methods
worked
better
for
me
than
others.
Eventually,
I
began
to
try
to
help
my
students
by
using
the
same
processes
I
draw
upon
in
my
own
writing
because
they
are
so
comfortable
for
me.
I
always
start
with
an
outline
so,
as
a
result,
creating
a
cohesive
outline
was
one
of
the
first
things
I
would
stress
to
my
students.
Unsurprisingly,
one
of
the
exercises
I
found
most
effective
in
my
conferences
was
rreverse
outlinings
where
using
their
completed
essay
the
student
and
I
would
try
to
recreate
their
outline
to
decide
if
their
writing
followed
a
well
developed
structure.
This
helped
to
expose
unnecessary
paragraphs
or
areas
where
the
purpose
and
flow
of
the
essay
was
unclear.
I
also
often
had
my
students
read
sections
of
their
essays
out
loud
to
listen
for
run-on
sentences,
awkward
syntax,
or
grammar
errors.
This
was
something
I
had
always
done
in
my
own
writing
without
ever
really
thinking
about
it
but
it
proved
to
also
be
an
effective
tool
for
showing
my
students
when
something
just
didnut
sound
rightiaa
problem
that
could
be
so
hard
to
articulate
especially
to
non-native
speakers.
I
soon
found
that
in
trying
to
make
my
students
better
writers
I,
almost
accidentally,
became
a
better
writer
myself
because
I
was
more
aware
of
my
process
and
what
it
took
to
make
my
writing
sound
its
best.
Thinking
about
it
now,
its
difficult
to
say
for
sure
what
it
is
that
makes
a
good
writer.
I
donut
think
that
there
are
any
specific
qualities
that
make
some
writers
better
than
others.
But,
after
working
through
countless
conferences,
I
have
come
to
believe
that
confidence
is
one
of
the
most
important
factors
in
writing
an
rAs
paper
or
a
National
Best
Seller.
The
author
has
to
have
the
confidence
to
believe
that
what
they
are
writing
matters
and
that
their
opinion,
even
if
its
unconventional,
is
correct.
This
is
why
I
would
always
try
to
end
my
conferences
making
my
students
feel
more
confident
by
highlighting
the
areas
where
they
excelled.
This,
I
think,
helped
to
show
them
the
different
stylistic
and
mechanical
choices
that
really
worked
for
the
reader
that
they
could
use
in
other
papers
in
order
to
devote
more
time
to
the
more
problematic
areas.
With
more
confidence
in
their
writing
I
hoped
my
students
wouldnut
have
to
attach
that
warning
label,
rIum
not
a
very
good
writer,s
to
their
future
essays.
While
helping
my
FYS
class
was
my
primary
job
as
a
WA
last
year
I
found
that
over
the
course
of
the
semester
the
College
Writing
Program
became
about
more
than
just
my
students.
By
spending
so
much
time
thinking
about,
talking
about,
and
editing
writing
my
relationship
changed
to
not
only
to
writing
but
also
to
reading.
I
began
to
think
more
critically
about
the
writing
styles
of
the
books
I
read,
the
accuracy
with
which
people
answered
pointed
questions,
and
how
to
deconstruct
essays
and
articles
that
I
read
in
class
to
look
for
holes
in
their
structure.
I
no
longer
passively
read
but
instead
I
find
myself
constantly
asking
why.
Why
did
the
author
use
that
word?
Why
did
she
include
that
paragraph?
Why
did
he
word
the
title
like
that?iaquestions
I
used
I
used
to
pose
to
my
FYS
students
all
of
the
time.
Now
see
that
even
for
professionals
writing
isnut
an
effortless
flow
of
words
but
a
culmination
of
specific
choices
in
everything
from
individual
words
to
overall
style
as
a
means
to
elicit
a
reaction
from
the
reader.
In
my
own
writing,
I
too
have
become
more
conscious
of
my
choices
and
my
process
when
I
begin
a
writing
assignment.
This
new
approach
to
thinking
about
writing,
which
I
developed
from
working
with
the
College
Writing
Program,
has
allowed
me
to
communicate
more
effectively
with
other
writers
from
my
FYS
students,
to
my
peers,
to
my
professors
because
I
have
a
better
sense
of
the
mechanics
of
writing.
When
I
started
working
at
the
College
Writing
Program
last
year
I
never
could
have
guessed
that
in
helping
my
FYS
students
I
would,
in
many
ways,
be
helping
myself
become
a
better
writer.
