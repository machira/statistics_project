Not
Exactly
What
A
Writer
Ordered
ThereOs
a
little
more
to
writing
than
beginning
with
the
words
Nonce
upon
a
time.O
A
starting
point
that
grounds
the
reader
into
a
realm
of
the
writerOs
creation
is
a
difficult
feat
to
accomplish
in
our
increasingly
high-speed
world.
If
a
reader
canOt
sink
into
Nthe
zoneO
hardly
a
moment
is
wasted
and
the
reader
moves
onto
processing
information
that
hooks
their
attention
instantly.
Over
and
over
again
I
see
that
the
world
dismisses
writing
as
an
effective
means
of
communication.
Instead,
writing
is
abandoned
in
favor
of
visual
or
auditory
information
that
is
chopped,
diced,
and
sliced
into
micro-manageable
morsels
that
provide
consumers
with
merely
a
diluted
taste
of
stories.
Experiencing
the
true
robustness
of
description
requires
patience
to
engage
in
a
NstoryO
from
beginning
to
endEand
many
have
lost
the
appetite
to
enjoy
the
complexities
a
great
piece
of
writing
can
provide.
From
disinterest
in
reading,
often-scholarly
works
or
complicated
texts
with
discipline
specific
jargon,
an
aversion
towards
writing
also
emerges.
Both
reading
and
writing
involve
a
rather
large
investment
of
time
to
process
and
communicate
information.
Even
the
speediest
of
readers
(or
writers
though
I
tend
to
believe
speedy
writers
are
somewhat
of
a
myth)
have
to
go
over
different
passages
in
order
to
fully
comprehend
the
material
read
or
written.
Of
course,
a
majority
of
my
time
at
school
is
spent
in
the
company
of
other
students,
and
as
a
Writing
Associate
I
have
spent
more
time
observing
how
the
mind
of
a
student
writer
operatesEor
at
least
theorizing
how
the
average
student
writer
thinks
about
writing.
For
the
overachieving
students,
stress
from
writing
comes
stems
from
the
fear
that
professors
will
be
unimpressed.
Students
simply
going
through
the
motions
to
Nget
it
doneO
stress
about
having
enough
time
to
write
something
decent
enough
to
achieve
the
minimum
requirements.
Both
attitudes
towards
writing
transforms
the
task
into
a
detestable
chore
that
professors
assign
regularly
and
precludes
students
from
taking
full
advantage
of
every
social
opportunity.
The
collegiate
experience
favors
speed
within
the
classroom
and
the
demands
set
by
professors
for
studentsO
catalysts
dispassion
for
completing
coursework.
Dispassion,
in
my
relatively
inexperienced
opinion,
is
the
greatest
challenge
facing
student
writers.
ItOs
something
that
is
so
debilitating
to
the
writing
and
learning
process
that
employing
means
to
cope
with
dispassion
requires
an
exhausting
amount
of
energy.
Over
the
past
year,
the
pattern
of
battling
dispassion
became
somewhat
of
a
recurring
theme
for
certain
classes.
During
the
fall
semester,
my
least
favorite
course
was
Introduction
to
Political
Theory.
Though
I
will
keep
the
name
of
the
professor
anonymous,
I
will
admit
that
the
class
was
the
most
poorly
organized
one
of
my
college
experience.
Every
time
I
went
to
class
on
Tuesday
and
Thursday
mornings,
I
dreaded
sitting
in
my
seat
for
75
minutes
to
listen
to
complete
nonsense
and
babble.
In
most
of
my
classes
(even
the
boring
ones)
I
could
always
NreplayO
the
class
period
and
articulate
one
interesting
or
useful
piece
of
information
or
idea
I
learned.
However,
my
attempts
to
find
anything
remotely
palatable
to
my
mind
were
feeble.
When
it
came
to
writing
papers
for
the
class,
I
could
feel
myself
mired
in
a
pit
of
mud.
No
matter
how
much
I
reread
passages
of
Manchiavelli
or
Karl
Marx,
I
could
never
synthesize
my
analyses
into
acceptable
political
theory
papers.
Even
when
I
went
to
the
professor
for
help,
he
could
never
explain
what
was
NwrongO
with
my
papers.
Although
I
would
like
to
blame
the
professor
for
my
grade
in
the
course,
I
think
that
my
ultimate
disinterest
in
the
class
probably
was
more
of
a
detriment
to
me.
ThereOs
nothing
wrong
with
possessing
distaste
for
a
class,
but
the
unfortunate
fact
is
that
the
professor
must
ultimately
report
a
grade
for
a
student.
I
suspect
that
even
if
what
I
wrote
was
communicated
well,
I
am
sure
that
my
dispassion
for
political
theory
was
apparent.
Even
as
I
revisit
some
of
my
writing
from
that
particular
class,
I
am
bored
to
tears
with
how
disinteresting
my
material
presents
itself.
The
words
are
words
and
the
sentences
are
sentences,
but
there
is
no
sense
of
a
desire
to
instill
a
new
point
to
the
reader.
To
sum
it
all
up,
my
lack
of
interest
in
the
class
led
to
a
lack
of
interest
in
the
writing
process.
Therefore,
the
words
on
the
page
presented
my
points
but
never
inspired
the
reader
to
think
and
question
the
points
presented
as
a
means
to
reexamine
personal
thoughts
and
opinions
on
the
subject
matter.
Looking
back
on
that
class
now,
I
can
relate
my
difficulties
with
writing
for
Political
Theory
with
the
difficulties
in
NWAingO
the
students
in
the
FYS.
The
partner
professor
I
worked
with
for
the
FYS
provided
students
with
lengthy
prompts
that
confused
the
students
as
to
what
the
central
focus
of
the
paper
was
supposed
to
adhere
to.
Of
course,
I
felt
that
the
prompts
were
similar
for
each
writing
assignmentEso
it
was
no
surprise
to
me
that
most
students
quickly
disconnected
from
completing
the
assignments
with
quality.
As
I
tried
to
facilitate
the
writing
process
for
the
students,
I
quickly
discovered
that
the
lack
of
quality
in
the
writing
related
not
only
to
the
Nboring
writing
assignmentsO
but
also
to
complete
disinterest
in
the
class.
With
such
apathy
came
a
complete
annoyance
at
the
thought
of
writing
a
paper
on
how
scientific
articles
are
written
for
readersEa
detestable
chore.
At
minimum,
I
was
able
to
identify
how
the
students
could
reexamine
and
revise
their
work
to
make
arguments
flow
better.
But
the
grimaces
on
their
faces
are
something
I
know
all
too
wellEthat
even
if
a
paper
improves
nothing
could
makeup
for
the
torture
that
ennui
sets
upon
the
mindset
of
the
student
writer.
So
how
can
someone
be
a
NgoodO
writer
even
when
material
is
believed
disinteresting
to
the
writer?
That
is,
a
writer
should
find
some
angle
to
approach
a
given
assignment
that
disguises
dispassion
for
the
subject
if
in
fact
such
an
attitude
exists
towards
the
assignment.
The
type
of
writing
I
like
best
involves
writing
about
either
film
or
literature
(though
in
the
non-academic
arena
I
enjoy
writing
short
stories
when
I
find
myself
inspired).
Writing
about
these
subjects
is
very
rewarding
for
it
gives
me
a
chance
to
ground
myself
in
the
humanity
expressed
through
these
arts.
The
classes
where
I
was
able
to
write
about
such
topics
were
also
the
classes
that
I
enjoyed
the
mostEeven
when
I
did
not
like
a
particular
film
or
book
I
could
always
find
a
means
to
write
something
meaningful.
In
order
to
overcome
my
distaste
for
such
particulars,
I
always
found
a
means
to
connect
with
the
material
I
was
writingEnot
exactly
finding
a
match
to
my
own
personal
life,
but
to
relate
the
material
to
something
more
straightforward
in
the
human
experience.
That
is,
rather
than
concentrating
on
my
dislike
for
the
subject,
I
found
ways
to
put
the
lessons
from
class
into
a
more
comprehensive
perspective
to
explicate
the
successful
elements
of
a
piece
as
well
as
explanations
for
certain
reactions
and
opinions.
In
other
words,
through
writing
I
could
also
figure
out
why
I
disliked
something
even
more
successfully
than
why
I
would
love
something
until
the
end
of
time.
As
spring
semester
continued,
I
experimented
with
writing
about
topics
I
would
not
normally
gravitate
towards.
Exercising
my
will
power
to
resist
writing
about
things
I
loved
prepared
me
to
handle
communicating
ideas
outside
my
comfort
zone.
The
best
case
study
to
illustrate
this
approach
is
my
experiences
in
my
VaST
course.
As
luck
would
have
it,
I
was
assigned
to
a
class
that
was
my
absolute
last
choiceEI
was
less
than
enthralled
with
the
idea
of
engaging
in
discussions
about
the
ethics
of
growing
corn
and
raising
cattle.
Within
the
first
two
weeks
of
the
class,
I
had
to
present
a
final
paper
topic
to
my
professor
and
I
could
not
help
but
feel
rather
annoyed
at
the
prospect
of
having
to
write
a
paper
about
the
agricultural
industry.
On
a
rainy
day
in
February
I
found
myself
zoning
out
in
class
so
I
could
solve
my
topic-choosing
dilemma.
See,
the
problem
was
that
thinking
about
such
a
thing
was
so
frustrating
and
boring
that
I
ended
up
doodling
for
75
minutes
instead
of
listening
to
a
lecture
on
the
diabolical
certainty
that
feeding
cattle
and
chickens
corn
would
destroy
the
idea
of
a
healthy
American.
At
some
point,
I
started
writing
my
short
paper
for
my
American
Studies
seminar
called
Women
and
Gender
in
SocietyEand
that
was
when
I
had
a
crazy
idea.
What
if
my
VaST
paper
paralleled
with
the
material
I
was
learning
in
the
seminar
course?
I
decided
that
my
paper
would
detail
how
the
debate
of
population
control
(as
a
means
to
preserve
agricultural
viability)
affected
women.
Essentially,
I
viewed
my
final
paper
as
a
way
of
humanizing
the
NscientificO
topics
discussed
in
VaST.
Although
the
class
ended
up
not
as
a
favorite
of
mine,
writing
my
final
paper
was
a
rewarding
experience
because
I
found
a
way
to
care
about
what
I
was
writing
(even
if
I
did
not
initially
like
the
topic
or
the
focus
of
the
course
in
the
first
place).
Another
peculiarity
of
spring
semester
was
that
I
was
also
assigned
as
a
WA
to
work
with
students
in
a
different
VaST
course.
In
every
single
conference,
the
students
all
expressed
the
complete
horror
about
the
class
organization
and
assignment
prompts
(I
was
never
provided
with
any
guidelines
other
than
vague
verbal
instructions).
It
was
clear
that
no
matter
how
hard
I
tried
to
help
the
students
put
their
dispassion
and
annoyance
aside
the
negative
feelings
towards
completing
assignments
for
the
class
continued
to
grow.
Once
again,
I
found
myself
helping
the
studentsO
sort
out
their
organization
and
addressing
the
requirements
of
the
assignment
but
I
never
felt
successful
at
dispelling
some
of
the
Ngloom.O
So,
curing
dispassion
and
apathy
for
writing
means
viewing
a
much
hated
class,
assignment,
etc.
in
a
different
light.
Great
writers
seem
to
have
a
knack
for
drawing
in
even
the
most
disinterested
readersEthey
find
ways
to
creatively
humanize
the
points
communicated
in
their
writing.
And
though
I
have
my
own
ways
to
put
words
on
blank
pages,
I
know
that
the
average
student
struggles
to
grapple
with
a
task
they
hate
to
have
on
their
agenda.
Yes,
I
can
help
anyone
with
the
basic
structure
of
a
paper
and
provide
feedback
on
PowerPoint
presentations,
but
I
cannot
alter
the
attitude
a
student
has
towards
writing.
No
matter
what
anecdotes
I
recount,
the
student
must
decide
for
himself
or
herself
that
reading
and
writing
is
a
useful
investment
of
their
time
because
it
allows
them
to
overcome
feelings
of
dispassion.
Whatever
the
NmagicO
is
in
a
great
piece
of
student
writing,
a
student
cannot
look
up
a
spell
or
a
recipe
to
make
their
papers
interesting
or
articulate.
What
I
continue
to
find
is
that
the
art
of
writing,
in
any
capacity,
is
much
more
mystifying.
The
more
I
learn,
the
more
I
am
confused
as
to
how
writing
improves
and
whatOs
good
or
whatOs
badEthe
list
could
go
on
forever.
Sometimes
I
feel
as
though
I
benefit
from
my
experiences
as
a
WA
more
than
the
students
who
come
for
Nhelp.O
Ultimately,
I
relate
everything
that
goes
on
in
conferences
to
my
life
and
internalize
different
anecdotes
to
help
my
writing.
So
the
challenging
part
of
helping
students
is
not
necessarily
digging
up
what
works
well
in
the
paper,
but
understanding
how
a
student
thinks
and
approaches
the
assignment.
I
think
so
much
differently
than
most
of
the
students
who
come
to
my
conferencesEI
always
know
how
I
would
write
something.
But
I
always
fear
that
my
suggestions
(or
prescriptions)
hinder
the
creative
connections
a
student
might
create
within
their
writing.
I
fear
that
by
giving
advice,
I
take
away
the
rewards
of
the
writing
processEwithout
struggle
there
is
no
epiphany
and
without
epiphany
there
is
no
way
to
ensure
that
a
student
will
find
the
best
solution
to
infuse
inspiration
into
their
writing
process.
