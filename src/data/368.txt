Returning
WA
Essay
Fall
2002
The
previous
academic
year
has
barely
settled
into
my
memory
and
the
coming
semester
is
already
upon
me.
Once
again
I
will
be
performing
my
duties
as
a
Writing
Associate.
And
once
again
I
question
my
sanity
as
I
take
on
a
job
that
entails
countless
hours
of
reading
and
counseling
eager
(or
not
so
eager)
writers
on
the
pitfalls
of
writing
for
demanding
college
professors.
Meanwhile
I
will
be
trying
to
keep
my
own
classes
in
order.
I
find
the
need
to
review
the
logic
that
led
to
my
decision
to
return
as
a
WA.
Last
summer
when
I
returned
to
school,
I
was
fully
prepared
to
receive
training
to
become
a
WA.
I
expected
the
training
session
to
reveal
all
the
secrets
of
how
to
turn
any
conference
into
a
successful
one,
no
matter
what
the
writer
threw
at
me.
Unfortunately,
no
great
magical
secrets
were
given
out,
although
I
did
receive
some
helpful
advice,
though
not
as
much
as
I
would
have
liked.
I
think
that
I
probably
would
have
benefited
more
from
mock
conferences
than
just
conversations
about
how
to
write
on
a
topic.
Although
I
did
use
some
of
these
techniques
not
only
in
my
conferences,
but
also
in
my
writing,
I
think
that
I
probably
needed
a
little
more
experience
interacting
with
a
writer
(even
a
role-play)
at
that
point.
My
expectations
for
the
professor
for
my
first
assignment
as
a
WA
were
very
high.
I
expected
him
to
have
a
bevy
of
papers
for
me
at
our
first
meeting
and
to
be
able
to
put
out
before
me
exactly
what
was
expected
of
me
for
the
semester.
I
was
startled
when
I
found
out
that
although
he
had
taught
the
fys
before,
he
was
very
laid
back
and
was
really
looking
for
me
to
not
only
set
the
agenda
for
the
meeting,
but
for
how
I
would
like
my
participation
in
the
course
to
go.
He
believes
that
writing
is
a
process
(which
I
also
believe).
He
said
therefore
that
students
would
have
chances
to
earn
back
points
lost
on
papers
if
their
drafts
improved.
At
first
I
thought
this
was
a
brilliant
idea.
It
was
exactly
the
kind
of
situation
I
would
want
in
a
writing
class--the
ability
to
keep
working
towards
a
more
perfect
paper.
I
was
not
thinking
of
the
implications
that
his
plan
would
have
on
my
part
as
a
WA.
The
first
round
of
conferences
went
well.
I
had
a
well-rounded
group
of
freshmen,
from
the
serious
writers
to
the
ones
who
I
would
know
I
would
need
to
help
more.
I
even
had
one
girl
ask
what
was
involved
in
becoming
a
writing
associate.
I
thought
I
was
set
for
the
semester.
This
was
going
to
be
easy.
My
first
time
doing
drop-in
hours
was
not
too
difficult
either.
I
was
able
to
help
one
student
in
particular
whom
I
became
good
friends
with
in
a
class
in
the
spring
semester.
I
was
beginning
to
wonder
what
I
had
been
so
apprehensive
about.
Then
Murphy's
Law
kicked
in.
Anything
that
could
go
wrong
did.
My
professors
started
to
pile
on
the
work.
I
was
constantly
doing
lab
work
for
my
teaching
assistant
position.
I
was
going
to
crew
practice
sometimes
twice
a
day.
And
then
it
hit
like
a
Mack
truck--conference
week.
Suddenly
every
free
moment
(and
some
not
so
free)
were
spent
in
Pardee
319.
I
was
reading
papers
late
into
the
night
and
learning
that
my
students
were
not
always
faithful
about
coming
to
conferences.
Things
only
got
worse
when
I
would
try
to
reschedule
conferences
only
to
be
stood
up
again.
I
learned
that
it
was
not
worth
my
effort
to
spend
extra
time
in
319
when
the
professor
could
help
my
situation
much
easier
by
speaking
to
the
negligent
students.
Things
improved
some
and
by
the
third
round
of
conferences
most
of
the
students
were
coming
on
time
even.
My
biggest
success
that
semester
was
with
a
student
who
told
me
from
the
beginning
that
writing
had
always
been
difficult
for
him.
His
first
couple
papers
were
rough,
but
he
showed
the
willingness
to
work.
He
even
took
it
upon
himself
to
ask
me
to
look
over
his
new
drafts
to
resubmit
to
the
professor.
I
felt
like
I
was
finally
making
progress
with
a
student.
I
was
finally
doing
what
I
thought
was
my
job.
By
the
third
paper
there
was
a
significant
level
of
improvement
in
his
writing.
He
had
learned
to
write
a
decent
draft
of
a
research
paper.
He
was
even
able
to
point
out
to
me
where
he
thought
he
needed
to
expand
and
what
he
was
planning
on
revising.
Maybe
someone
was
listening
to
my
advice
after
all.
After
many
of
the
students
assuming
that
I
was
there
only
to
edit
grammar
I
was
amazed
that
I
was
able
to
help
someone
with
the
process--not
just
the
clean-up.
The
end
of
the
semester
survey
posed
an
interesting
question--what
sort
of
course
would
I
like
to
be
assigned
to
for
the
second
semester.
The
first
semester
I
hadn't
had
any
input
in
the
decision.
I
was
not
unhappy
to
have
a
first
year
seminar
as
my
first
assignment.
I
just
wish
the
topic
had
been
different.
All
Writing
Associates
work
on
techniques
to
deal
with
a
wide
range
of
fields.
We
are
equipped
with
the
basic
rules
of
writing
for
English,
history,
science,
and
engineering.
I
would
have
felt
adequate
dealing
with
any
of
these
topics.
Mexico
is
not
something
I
am
very
familiar
with
though.
I
could
help
my
students
with
any
structural
or
technical
part
of
their
research
papers.
I
unfortunately
could
not
tell
them
if
what
they
had
written
seemed
correct
and
accurate
for
what
the
professor
was
expecting
for
the
topic.
This
provided
me
with
a
little
bid
of
perspective
when
answering
the
question
of
what
class
I
would
like
to
be
assigned
to.
Though
I
know
that
most
people
think
you
must
be
an
English
major
to
be
a
WA,
I
am
a
biology
major
and
thus
find
myself
more
comfortable
dealing
with
scientific
papers.
I
thought
that
the
numerous
VaST
classes
offered
in
the
second
semester
would
be
the
perfect
opportunity
for
me
to
really
be
effective.
I
could
not
only
help
out
with
the
technical
details,
but
also
with
the
factual
part
of
the
paper.
My
request
seemed
to
have
been
granted
as
I
was
assigned
to
a
VaST
class
for
the
spring
semester.
The
professor
was
from
the
engineering
department,
which
was
a
change
from
the
previous
professor
I
had
worked
with
in
the
foreign
language
department.
Though
some
of
their
outlooks
on
my
responsibilities
were
similar,
on
the
issue
of
keeping
appointments
they
differed
greatly.
My
new
professor
looked
upon
the
meetings
with
me
as
sort
of
a
practice
run
for
meetings
in
his
students'
future
careers.
He
told
me
at
our
first
meeting
that
in
the
real
world
people
don't
just
miss
meetings
without
warning
and
that
his
students
shouldn't
miss
meetings
without
contacting
me
first.
I
was
to
inform
him
of
any
students
who
failed
to
show
up
for
meetings.
I
believe
that
although
this
professor
was
not
from
a
traditional
"writing"
department,
that
his
outlook
toward
what
he
expected
from
his
students
and
I
was
much
easier
to
follow
than
my
previous
professors.
At
this
time
I
was
also
enrolled
in
a
VaST
course.
Though
my
professor
had
told
me
that
I
need
not
attend
WA
meetings
since
I
was
one
myself,
I
went
anyway.
It
was
my
first
time
having
a
WA
conference
since
being
hired
as
a
WA.
It
was
also
my
WA's
first
time
having
a
WA
as
a
student.
I
found
that
the
meeting
went
a
lot
smoother
than
some
of
my
conferences
were
going.
My
WA,
since
he
knew
that
I
was
a
WA,
didn't
focus
at
all
on
the
technical
details,
but
instead
helped
me
refocus
where
I
strayed
and
helped
me
recognize
what
style
I
was
using
in
the
good
passages
so
I
could
replicate
it
in
the
rougher
passages.
There
was
no
awkwardness
since
we
both
knew
the
devices
the
other
was
speaking
of
and
did
not
have
to
worry
about
the
usual
grammar
issues
that
come
up
when
many
students
attend
conferences.
My
meetings
with
my
WA
not
only
helped
improve
my
writing,
but
also
made
me
take
a
look
at
how
I
was
conducting
my
own
conferences.
I
compared
my
conferences
with
a
typical
student
with
that
of
my
one
student
who
was
also
a
WA.
I
found
that
with
the
students
who
weren't
WAs,
I
spent
the
majority
of
the
conference
on
thesis
and
structure,
but
found
myself
spending
significant
time
going
over
grammar
mistakes
and
awkward
wordings.
It
was
as
though
I
assumed
that
the
mistakes
were
due
to
lack
of
knowledge
rather
than
a
lack
of
editing
which
is
what
I
would
usually
attribute
my
WA
student's
grammar
mistakes
to.
I
also
found
that
my
students
were
less
attentive
to
the
grammar
part
of
the
conferences
since
most
were
probably
planning
on
using
grammar
check
instead
of
learning
the
proper
rules.
I
started
to
refer
my
students
who
made
frequent
errors
to
either
the
St.
Martin's
Handbook
or
to
the
grammar
lab.
Meetings
became
less
frustrating
when
I
wasn't
having
discussions
with
students
about
what
was
or
was
not
a
run
on
sentence.
My
WA
is
responsible
for
this
change
in
my
methods
and
I
find
the
program
keeps
feeding
back
on
itself
My
own
writing
over
the
year
changed
in
some
aspects.
Previously
I
had
always
tried
to
write
my
first
draft
as
if
it
were
my
final
draft
to
be
handed
in
to
the
professor
for
a
grade.
I
left
no
room
for
revision
without
radical
changes
being
required.
Usually
I
used
all
my
ideas
in
the
paper
and
had
none
left
over
in
case
something
didn't
mesh
well
or
I
needed
to
expand.
At
staff
meetings
we
often
talked
about
how
to
encourage
our
writers
to
make
suggestions
during
the
conference,
while
they
were
still
in
the
draft
process.
For
my
first
VaST
paper
I
tried
this
new
strategy
of
picking
out
more
topics
than
would
fit
into
the
page
limit.
I
kept
a
couple
of
quotes
on
reserve
in
case
the
paper
didn't
flow
well.
I
found
that
the
revision
process
went
a
lot
easier
if
I
helped
myself
out
in
the
early
brainstorming
stages
of
the
writing.
Writing
for
a
VaST
was
also
slightly
novel
for
me.
Most
of
my
previous
writing
experiences
were
for
English
or
history
classes.
My
scientific
writing
consisted
of
short
essays
on
exams
and
the
occasional
short
report.
It
seemed
as
if
the
two
sides
of
my
brain
would
not
mesh.
I
could
write,
and
I
could
understand
the
science,
but
could
I
write
so
that
my
professor
would
understand
the
science?
Again,
I
owe
my
success
in
my
writing
to
my
wonderful
WA.
As
our
conference
was
winding
down
we
were
talking
about
my
friend
in
the
VaST
class
and
he
commented
on
how
different
our
papers
were.
He
said
that
my
friend
wrote
very
technically,
using
much
of
the
science
with
explanations
only
where
absolutely
needed.
I
on
the
other
hand,
seemed
to
write
using
many
examples,
both
common
and
scientific,
to
make
my
point
for
me.
Previously
I
had
never
viewed
my
writing
to
take
on
this
style,
but
upon
rereading
the
paper,
I
found
what
he
said
to
be
absolutely
correct.
On
the
next
assignment
I
tried
to
just
write
"normally."
I
decided
not
to
try
to
use
any
style
specifically
and
just
see
what
came
out
on
paper.
When
I
read
the
draft
I
found
that
I
subconsciously
fell
into
the
style
of
making
examples
to
prove
my
thesis.
From
then
on
I
decided
to
use
this
style
and
the
grades
on
my
papers
showed
that
I
seemed
to
have
found
my
groove
in
scientific
writing.
Thus
the
second
semester
ended
and
I
had
to
decide
if
I
wanted
to
continue
being
a
writing
associate
for
the
following
semester.
I
talked
it
over
with
some
of
my
friends
and
my
parents
to
get
different
perspectives.
It
seemed
that
the
majority
of
them
told
me
I
needed
to
keep
being
a
WA.
When
I
asked
why
most
said
that
I
have
a
natural
attention
to
detail
that
could
be
helpful
to
other
students.
While
I
did
have
my
share
of
bad
WA
moments
(being
stood
up
twice
in
24
hours
by
the
same
student,
doing
10
hours
of
drop-in
the
last
week
of
the
semester
which
I
was
not
scheduled
for),
overall
I
enjoyed
being
able
to
help
students
with
some
aspects
of
their
writing.
Over
the
year,
I
had
learned
that
although
I
did
not
have
to
revolutionize
their
papers
by
creating
new
theses
or
completely
revamping
the
structure,
I
could
still
help
them
think
of
something
for
their
papers
that
maybe
they
hadn't
thought
of
before.
One
student
told
me
that
the
idea
I
had
given
them
of
writing
the
body
of
the
paper
before
the
intro
to
help
determine
what
they
were
going
to
prove
led
to
less
frustration
in
the
writing
of
the
draft.
Conferences
were
not
meant
to
create
a
perfect
paper.
I'm
just
supposed
to
point
them
down
the
path
to
a
better
draft.
So
as
I
anticipate
my
return
to
Easton,
I
am
looking
forward
to
helping
a
new
batch
of
students
with
their
anxieties
about
writing.
Besides,
I
have
always
said
that
there's
no
fun
in
doing
the
"sane"
thing.
