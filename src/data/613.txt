Literacy
Narrative
New
Writing
Assistant
My
earliest
memories
of
writing
are
full
of
terror.
As
the
unlucky
son
of
elementary
school
teachers,
the
lazy
leisure
of
my
summer
was
frequently
interrupted
by
calls
back
inside
the
house.
My
brother
and
I
were
instructed
to
practice
math,
reading
and
writing
for
whatever
standardized
test
the
following
year
promised.
As
I
argued
to
my
parents
that
Nsummer
vacationO
meant
I
was
better
not
working,
my
parents
responded
I
would
be
smarter
for
it.
I
do
not
know
whether
the
testing
improved
anything,
but
I
found
writing
to
be
dreadful.
Most
importantly,
I
hated
the
physical
process
of
writing.
My
penmanship
was
notoriously
awful
among
my
elementary
school
teachers,
and
I
refused
to
use
rubber
grips
on
my
pencils
because
they
were
not
comfortable.
My
embarrassment
coupled
with
boredom;
no
topic
seemed
to
arouse
my
interest
enough
for
me
to
write.
I
do
not
remember
exactly
how
I
began
to
enjoy
writing,
but
I
often
credit
the
change
to
my
fifth
grade
teacher.
She
was
tough,
but
she
encouraged
students
to
write
about
things
that
interested
them.
The
opportunity
allowed
me
to
harness
my
imagination,
generally
devoted
to
Star
Wars,
and
direct
it
towards
quirky
stories
about
aliens
who
meant
to
take
over
Earth
but
instead
are
convinced
to
make
peace.
I
remember
feeling
determined
to
portray
aliens
not
as
evil
invaders
but
as
complicated
characters
just
like
humans.
Around
this
time,
I
decided
that
I
wanted
to
write
a
book.
However,
I
was
so
afraid
of
people
reading
my
work-in-progress
that
I
would
try
to
wake
up
at
five
in
the
morning
to
type
as
much
as
I
could
onto
the
computer.
Waking
up
so
early
proved
to
be
a
nearly
impossible
task
and,
fifteen
pages
and
almost
a
year
later,
I
lost
all
enthusiasm
for
my
story.
I
started
to
enjoy
academic
papers
in
sixth
grade.
As
a
member
of
my
elementary
schoolOs
advanced
studentsO
program,
I
was
encouraged
to
pursue
an
independent
study.
My
plan
to
write
an
essay
was
blander
than
the
poster
presentations
and
board
games
my
friends
designed,
but
I
was
deeply
interested
in
my
topic.
I
wanted
to
find
out
whether
God
existed.
I
arranged
interviews
with
a
diverse
array
of
religious
people
in
my
town,
including
my
priest,
the
reverend
who
lived
on
my
street,
a
rabbi
and
a
Buddhist.
I
asked
them
questions
about
the
problem
of
evil,
free
will
and
afterlife
and
tried
to
understand
their
complicated
responses.
My
paper
did
not
decisively
side
with
theism
or
atheism,
but
it
fostered
my
interest
in
philosophy.
I
was
very
proud
of
the
paper.
It
was
my
first
attempt
at
serious
research,
and
while
I
struggled
to
understand
thinkers
like
Thomas
Aquinas
and
Friedrich
Nietzsche,
I
summarized
the
arguments
as
decently
as
I
could
for
my
age.
While
I
maintained
a
similar
pride
in
the
academic
papers
I
wrote
for
my
classes,
I
was
most
passionate
about
the
poetry
I
wrote
privately.
It
was
dreadful
work,
and
almost
all
of
the
formless
rants
shared
the
theme
of
teenage
angst.
I
stopped
writing
these
towards
the
end
of
high
school,
but
in
college
I
challenged
myself
to
write
better
poetry.
In
my
sophomore
year
at
Lafayette,
I
was
awarded
the
Jean
Corrie
Poetry
Prize
for
a
poem
I
had
written
about
a
friend
of
mine.
Since
winning
that
award,
I
have
continued
write
poetry
and
have
developed
an
interest
in
writing
sonnets.
While
I
find
free
verse
the
easiest
way
to
convey
images
and
channel
emotions,
I
enjoy
the
sonnetOs
ability
to
say
so
much
in
only
fourteen
lines.
Most
of
my
pieces
are
either
political
or
philosophical
in
scope,
and
while
I
enjoy
employing
obscure
references
to
Greek
of
Biblical
mythology,
I
also
find
that
such
references
are
far
overused
in
modern
poetry,
and
probably
poetry
in
general.
I
also
like
to
write
fiction
in
my
free
time.
With
the
academic
year
being
too
busy,
I
attempt
to
write
at
least
one
short
story
every
summer.
I
find
myself
constantly
revising
pieces
that
I
have
already
written,
and
I
generally
do
not
mind
approaching
friends
or
family
to
hear
their
thoughts
on
my
stories.
I
share
almost
everything
I
write
with
my
brother,
who
recently
graduated
from
Lehigh
University.
He
has
a
keen
eye
for
detail
and
takes
in
interest
in
what
I
write
both
for
myself
as
well
as
for
my
philosophy
classes.
As
he
is
interested
in
my
study
of
philosophy,
I
took
an
interest
in
the
essays
he
wrote
for
his
religion
major.
We
frequently
edit
each
others
papers
and
our
styles
have
grown
to
become
very
similar.
I
have
found
a
harsher
critic
in
my
mother.
When
I
was
in
high
school,
I
would
present
my
essays
to
her
for
editing.
She
was
not
always
constructive,
but
I
actually
preferred
that;
through
a
process
of
brainstorming
and
debate,
portions
of
my
writing
would
be
revised
in
a
way
that
satisfied
both
of
us.
My
family
loves
the
writing
process,
and
my
mother
seems
to
genuinely
enjoy
reading
papers.
While
I
have
very
rarely
asked
for
her
insight
during
my
college
career,
I
consult
her
and
others
in
my
family
frequently
regarding
the
personal
statement
I
plan
to
include
in
my
application
to
law
school.
The
interaction
I
have
shared
between
my
mother
and
my
brother
is
immensely
similar
to
the
way
Donald
M.
Murray
describes
the
writing
conference
in
NThe
Listening
Eye:
Reflections
on
the
Writing
Conference.O
Through
helping
my
brother
and
being
helped
by
both
him
and
my
mother,
I
agree
with
Murray
that
the
student
often
already
has
the
ability
to
improve
his
or
her
writing,
but
simply
needs
the
presence
of
another
to
actually
see
how
the
improvement
needs
to
happen.
Sometimes
I
find
parts
of
an
essay
to
revise
simply
by
the
thought
of
presenting
it
to
someone
for
advice.
Often,
when
my
brother
and
I
share
papers
with
each
other,
one
would
only
need
to
point
out
a
problem
in
the
paper
for
the
other
to
know
exactly
how
to
improve
it.
MurrayOs
piece
also
reminds
me
of
my
sophomore
English
teacher
in
high
school
who
would
refuse
being
thanked
for
suggesting
improvements
to
papers
after
class.
She
insisted
that
the
student
did
all
of
the
editing,
that
she
merely
sat
and
watched.
She
would
never
admit
that
her
few
questions
were
helpful
enough
to
encourage
immense
changes.
Murray
seems
similarly
reluctant
to
admit
this,
though
he
sees
the
evidence
of
his
success
in
his
studentsO
improvement.
Even
if
the
students
already
ask
to
themselves
the
questions
he
plans
to
ask,
they
do
so
more
effectively
because
they
know
they
will
meet
with
Murray.
Advisors
like
Murray
and
Writing
Associates
may
do
their
best
when
they
simply
reflect
the
studentOs
thoughts
in
a
new
light.
My
high
school
teachers
placed
a
strong
emphasis
on
good
writing,
and
because
they
did
so,
I
feel
I
was
well
prepared
for
writing
in
college.
In
addition
to
the
efforts
of
my
English
teachers
to
foster
good
writing
habits,
I
enrolled
in
a
course
about
current
political
events
during
my
senior
year;
during
this
course
my
classmates
and
I
wrote
lengthy
policy
papers
about
a
multitude
of
issues
in
different
styles.
However,
when
discussing
our
first
assigned
essay
in
my
First
Year
Seminar
at
Lafayette,
one
student
in
my
class
asked
what
a
thesis
was.
I
was
shocked;
I
have
been
asked
to
write
papers
with
theses
since
middle
school,
and
in
my
senior
year
of
high
school
my
classmates
and
I
frequently
wrote
lengthy
papers
and
were
instructed
how
to
conduct
research
and
to
cite
sources.
Fortunately,
I
have
found
the
standards
for
college
writing
at
Lafayette
to
be
much
higher.
My
professors
have
usually
been
able
to
adapt
to
the
needs
of
different
students,
and
I
can
often
learn
from
the
challenges
my
professors
provide
me.
Further,
I
have
been
pushed
to
write
in
a
variety
of
styles
since
entering
Lafayette.
My
majors
are
in
Philosophy
and
Government
and
Law,
and
both
of
these
classes
present
interesting
opportunities
for
writing.
In
philosophy,
most
classes
include
small
discussions
as
to
what
exactly
constitutes
writing
philosophy.
This
issue
is
of
particular
interest
to
me,
because
while
our
philosophy
department
embraces
the
analytic
method
featured
in
Anglo-American
universities,
I
am
more
interested
in
the
existentialism
and
postmodernism
of
continental
Europe,
and
have
studied
these
philosophies
in
my
political
theory
classes.
Anglo-American
philosophy
and
continental
philosophy
employ
radically
different
methods
and
styles,
and
I
have
learned
much
from
my
reading
and
writing
of
both.
While
I
have
come
to
admire
Anglo-American
philosophyOs
commitment
to
logical
precision,
I
am
also
impressed
by
the
literary
passion
exhibited
by
Continental
thinkers,
as
well
as
their
commitment
to
answering
the
important
questions
which
make
philosophy
such
a
worthwhile
pursuit.
As
a
result,
I
have
found
that
the
essays
I
have
written
for
my
political
theory
classes
about
Continental
philosophy
are
particularly
analytic,
and
the
pieces
I
have
written
for
my
philosophy
classes
often
refer
more
to
the
larger
questions
of
philosophy
than
they
do
to
the
linguistic
technicalities
embraced
by
Anglo-American
thinkers.
Similarly,
my
Government
and
Law
classes
have
also
pushed
me
to
expand
my
abilities
as
a
writer.
LafayetteOs
department,
unlike
most
political
science
departments,
features
a
particular
emphasis
on
the
study
of
the
law,
and
therefore
offers
many
classes
about
the
study
of
the
Constitution
and
legal
history.
As
a
result,
professors
have
asked
me
to
write
legal
decisions
as
if
I
were
a
judge
presiding
over
hypothetical
cases.
I
find
these
assignments
enjoyable
because
I
am
able
to
justify
my
own
political
and
legal
convictions
through
these
hypothetical
situations
and
by
appealing
to
real
constitutional
precedents.
My
classes
for
this
major
have
also
required
me
to
write
lengthy
research
papers.
This
has
helped
me
not
only
improve
my
knowledge
of
gathering
research
but
also
of
how
to
synthesize
my
findings
and
present
a
strong
analysis.
My
writing
has
faced
its
biggest
challenges
on
the
Speech
and
Debate
team.
Normally,
my
writing
style
often
includes
lengthy
sentences
with
many
clauses.
Speechwriting,
however,
demands
clarity
and
concision.
Further,
while
I
can
often
agree
with
a
critic
about
specific
flaws
in
a
piece
I
have
written,
my
reactions
to
such
criticism
are
often
tense
or
defensive
in
tone.
Through
my
work
in
Speech
and
Debate,
I
have
learned
to
adapt
to
a
completely
new
style
of
writing,
and
have
also
learned
how
to
accept
criticism
more
easily.
Like
most
competitors
on
the
team,
my
speeches
endure
multiple
drafts
and
many
revisions.
The
process
can
often
be
frustrating,
but
the
speeches
that
have
resulted
from
this
process
have
usually
been
well-received.
This
summer
has
been
my
second
summer
interning
at
a
civil
rights
law
firm.
Given
that
law
is
the
field
of
study
I
plan
to
pursue
after
college,
this
internship
has
provided
me
with
my
first
real
experience
of
legal
writing.
The
attorneys
I
worked
for
would
suggest
interesting
briefs
for
me
to
read,
and
many
would
ask
me
to
edit
their
own
drafts
for
grammatical
errors.
I
have
found
legal
writing
not
too
different
from
normal
academic
writing,
though
it
uses
complicated
jargon
and
a
heavy
reliance
on
cases
for
authority.
Further,
while
legal
writing
is
immensely
different
from
the
legal
decisions
I
have
written
for
my
Government
and
Law
classes,
those
essays
have
actually
helped
me.
They
helped
me
to
understand
how
all
legal
writing
is
intimately
connected
with
the
cases
and
precedents
it
cites.
A
legal
brief
does
not
merely
cite
cases.
Instead,
it
attempts
to
prove
that
its
arguments
flow
naturally
and
completely
from
the
arguments
it
cites.
It
is
tense
and
demanding,
yet
legal
writing
nevertheless
allows
lawyers
the
opportunity
to
develop
their
own
written
voice.
