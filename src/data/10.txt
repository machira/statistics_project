A
Long
Captivating
Trip
WA
Assignment
August
28,
1995
Christmas,
Easter,
Valentine's
Day,
and
my
birthday
are
some
of
the
most
treasured
memories
of
my
early
childhood.
My
family
had
a
special
knack
at
making
an
ordinary
holiday
into
a
deliciously
magical
affair.
Although
my
extended
family
is
spread
out
across
the
country
and
would
rarely
be
with
us
on
these
days,
I
could
always
count
on
cards
and
packages
arriving
at
my
home.
I
would
tear
into
these
gifts
with
the
utmost
joy
and
excitement
thrilled
that
I
had
gotten
something
in
the
mail.
But
my
silent
appreciation
was
not
enough.
Several
days
after,
when
my
family
had
returned
to
living
normally
Mom
would
call
me
into
the
kitchen
and
sit
with
me
at
the
table,
patiently
drawing
lines
on
writing
paper
so
that
I
could
write
my
thank
you
notes.
Although
the
lines
were
about
an
inch
apart
and
I
only
had
to
write
about
two
sentences
I
remember
these
times
as
being
very
long,
difficult
and
tedious.
I
would
begin
to
write
but
I
had
to
stop
every
word
or
two
and
ask
how
it
was
spelled.
I
couldn't
imagine
how
anyone
could
enjoy
writing
or
even
bear
it
enough
to
write
a
seven
page
paper.
In
fact,
up
until
a
year
ago,
writing
still
seemed
like
a
long
and
tedious
process
offering
little
to
no
rewards.
I
can
remember
completing
my
first
essay
in
second
grade.
It
was
a
construction
paper
book
with
pictures
of
my
family,
friends
and
home.
My
teacher
and
I
worked
on
it
for
what
seemed
like
an
eternity
and
when
it
was
done
I
proudly
printed
My
Move
To
New
Hampshire,
by
Christy
Seed
on
the
cover.
But
I
must
have
felt
that
it
was
not
clear
that
it
was
an
essay
so
on
a
sheet
of
construction
paper
which
I
stapled
to
the
very
front
I
printed
S.A.
I
still
smile
when
I
think
of
my
innocent
mistake
and
when
I
think
of
how
my
teacher
must
have
sighed
when
she
saw
my
new
spelling
of
the
word
essay.
Writing
never
seemed
to
come
easily
to
me.
I
recall
having
a
very
difficult
time
with
spelling-a
tool
which
teachers
seem
to
think
is
essential
until
you
are
taught
how
to
use
a
wordprocessor
with
spellcheck
capabilities.
In
third
grade
I
was
initially
placed
in
an
advanced
spelling
group.
I
still
don't
know
why
I
was
placed
in
that
group,
perhaps
it
was
an
oversight
by
the
teacher
but
I
was
quickly
switched
back
to
the
average
spelling
group.
I
remember
the
agony
I
felt
in
fourth
and
fifth
grades
when
we
were
required
to
diagram
sentences
and
learn
the
difference
between
a
noun,
verb,
and
adjective.
I
couldn't
understand
why
my
teachers
would
want
us
to
learn
these
things
or
why
any
of
it
was
important.
I
also
remember
the
difference
between
there,
their
and
they're
eluded
me
up
until
I
was
in
high
school.
In
sixth
grade
I
remember
enjoying
Language
Arts
class
for
the
first
time
ever.
Perhaps
it
was
because
it
was
creative
writing
course
and
our
teacher
allowed
us
to
sit
anywhere
in
the
classroom
and
write.
My
friends
and
I
would
cluster
under
a
table
to
share
secrets
pretending
to
write
for
the
required
amount
of
time.
At
the
time
we
thought
we
were
really
sharp
to
hide
out
and
get
out
of
writing
yet
somehow
our
teacher
got
us
to
write
more
in
that
year
than
I
had
ever
written
in
my
life.
We
also
kept
journals,
a
practice
which
I
still
keep.
I
enjoyed
our
journal
time
because
for
the
first
time
writing
didn't
seem
like
such
a
chore.
I
was
writing
about
things
that
seemed
relevant
rather
than
about
Dick,
Jane,
and
Spot.
I
was
proud
of
my
writing
and
I
still
have
all
of
the
stories,
essays,
and
journals
I
completed
in
that
class.
Unfortunately,
after
sixth
grade
I
returned
to
language
arts
and
english
classes
which
never
seemed
interesting.
Although
I
didn't
enjoy
writing
I
loved
to
read
but
the
required
reading
in
my
english
classes
was
easy
and
bored
me
making
the
related
writing
assignments
even
more
tedious.
We
were
constrained
and
taught
about
rules
and
their
exceptions,
rather
than
learning
english
as
an
art
it
was
more
of
a
science
with
specific
stipulations.
Although
I
was
not
interested
in
writing,
in
my
Junior
year
I
went
against
my
teachers
wishes
and
placed
myself
in
the
Advanced
Placement
english
composition
course.
I
was
required
to
hand
in
a
paper
every
other
week
on
a
new
book
that
I
had
read.
Although
it
seemed
like
a
lot
of
writing
I
managed
to
do
well.
My
teacher
met
with
me
several
times
to
go
over
my
papers
often
times
she
would
shake
her
head
in
amazement
questioning
how
I
never
learned
grammar.
Somehow
I
received
the
nickname
grammar
impaired
idiot
and
even
though
she
was
joking
I
knew
that
my
writing
had
a
long
way
to
go.
I
completed
my
high
school
english
requirements
with
little
passion
or
interest.
English
and
writing
still
seemed
like
a
chore.
The
only
writing
that
I
enjoyed
was
writing
letters
to
my
friends.
I
attended
summer
camp
for
ten
years
where
I
developed
some
of
my
closest
friendships.
We
managed
to
stay
close
by
writing
letters
during
the
year.
When
I
got
a
letter
in
the
mail
I
would
rush
up
to
my
room
and
spend
hours
writing
pages
and
pages
back
to
them.
I
preferred
letters
than
the
telephone
because
I
always
felt
I
was
better
at
expressing
myself
on
paper
than
through
speech.
I
must
have
written
hundreds
of
pages
in
letters
to
friends
each
year
and
although
there
was
no
teacher
checking
over
or
grading
my
writing
I
believe
that
my
writing
and
english
improved
significantly
more
through
writing
so
many
pages
of
in
letters
than
at
any
other
point
in
my
life.
When
I
got
to
Lafayette
I
was
surprised
that
my
writing
earned
me
A's.
My
first
year
seminar
which
was
on
natural
medicines,
perfumes,
and
chemicals
was
a
good
introduction
to
college
writing.
Erin
was
assigned
to
me
as
my
writing
associate
and
through
her
I
gained
confidence
in
my
papers
and
writing
ability.
She
also
explained
a
lot
of
the
rules
of
gammer
in
a
way
that
I
finally
understood.
Because
I
had
such
a
good
experience
with
the
program
when
I
was
a
freshman
I
still
will
bring
papers
to
fellow
writing
associates
for
them
to
read
over.
My
first
year
seminar
professor
recommended
me
to
the
Writing
Associate
program,
an
act
which
boosted
my
confidence
in
my
writing
more
than
any
paper,
course
or
teacher.
When
I
was
offered
the
position
as
a
writing
associate
I
was
very
nervous
about
not
being
qualified
enough.
After
all
I
was
a
grammar
impaired
idiot
student
in
high
school!
I
attended
the
writing
associate
orientation
with
apprehension
and
a
bit
of
fear.
I
was
overwhelmed
when
we
were
told
that
we,
the
writing
associates,
were
the
cream
of
the
crop.
I
wanted
to
raise
my
hand
and
ask
if
there
had
been
a
mistake
in
the
application
process
and
I
had
been
an
oversight.
I
was
nervous
for
my
first
meetings
with
students
but
I
found
that
my
role
came
easily
to
me.
I
found
myself
enjoying
the
time
I
spent
helping
students.
Most
importantly
I
realized
that
by
helping
other
people
with
their
own
writing
I
was
improving
my
own
writing
by
identifying
mistakes
in
my
own
papers
that
I
had
spotted
in
their
papers.
I
also
found
myself
being
more
attentive
when
I
1was
writing
and
more
conscious
of
reading
over
my
papers
and
rewriting
before
I
handed
them
in.
Most
important
is
that
I
found
myself
enjoying
to
sit
down
and
write
a
paper.
It
no
longer
seemed
like
a
chore
but
rather
a
challenge
to
create
a
piece
of
writing
that
was
fluid,
clear
and
interesting
to
read.
I
made
a
complete
change
around
from
those
early
days
when
I
was
struggling
over
thank
you
notes.
I
have
found
that
I
enjoying
trying
to
put
words
on
a
paper
that
can
change
a
person's
attitude
or
day
and
put
a
smile
on
their
face.
I
hate
to
admit
it
but
I
now
like
to
sit
down
and
write
thank
you
notes.
In
addition,
I
no
longer
dread
spending
hours
in
front
of
my
computer
or
sitting
on
the
floor
with
pages
laid
out
in
front
of
me.
Writing
no
longer
seems
like
a
chore
but
instead
it
seems
like
an
exciting
challenge
with
no
true
destination
just
a
long
captivating
trip.
