Writing
as
a
WA
I
started
my
work
as
a
WA
with
a
lot
of
hopes
and
expectations
but
also
fears
and
insecurities.
My
experience,
I
believe,
was
rather
untypical
but
for
me
very
beneficial,
and
for
current
and
future
WAs
potentially
interesting.
First
of
all,
the
fact
that
I
did
manage
to
become
a
WA,
was
for
me
a
culmination
of
the
months
of
hard
work
I
put
into
perfecting
my
English.
Now
not
only
were
my
skills
good
enough
to
get
by
in
an
English
speaking
academic
environment,
they
were
good
enough
to
make
me
eligible
to
serve
as
an
advisor
to
native
speakers.
What
certainly
made
my
experience
rather
untypical
was
the
fact
that
the
professor
I
was
to
work
with
was
my
academic
advisor
thus
a
person
I
knew
very
well
even
before
we
started
working
together.
Therefore
I
knew
what
to
expect
and
was
not
surprised
by
his
approach
or
attitude
towards
me,
the
students
in
his
FYS
class
or
the
WA
program
as
a
whole.
I
call
this
fact
untypical
because
on
the
staff
meetings
during
the
year
we
would
many
times
hear
of
problems
that
WAs
had
cooperating
with
the
faculty
members.
Given
the
fact
that
both
me
and
the
professor
are
foreigners
and
therefore
we
are
not
native
speakers
of
English,
we
immediately
found
a
common
ground
and
started
our
WA-
professor
cooperation
with
a
long
conversation
about
the
problems
that
foreign
students
might
have
in
his
class
and
at
Lafayette
in
general.
The
professor
gave
me
a
long
lecture
about
what
he
expected
of
me
and
quickly
I
realized
that
as
long
as
my
WA
training
and
the
guidelines
of
the
writing
program
had
me
focused
on
the
structure
and
form
of
writing,
the
professor
saw
my
role
as
a
proof
reader
and
grammar
tutor.
This
difference
later
proved
to
me
my
greatest
problem
while
working
with
the
students.
I
found
myself
reconciling
the
roles
that
the
program
and
the
professor
assigned
me
and
many
a
time
I
felt
that
I
do
not
fulfill
either
of
them
well
enough.
With
some
papers
I
focused
on
structure
and
organization
whereas
with
others
I
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
correcting
grammar
and
spelling.
I
felt
that
I
could
not
do
both
but
at
the
same
time
I
felt
guilty
towards
the
students
and
towards
the
professor
if
I
did
not
work
on
the
linguistic
problems
of
the
paper.
The
most
important
experience
I
had
during
the
past
year,
that
influenced
me
as
a
writer,
was
the
realization
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
absolute
in
writing.
There
is
no
set
of
rules
that
apply
always
and
in
an
unchanged
manner.
There
are
however,
different
styles
and
manners
in
which
students
write,
and
they
all
can
prove
to
be
correct
as
long
as
they
communicate
the
writer's
intentions.
The
students
I
worked
with
ranged
from
well-formed
writers,
with
clear
ideas
in
their
minds,
to
students
with
basic
linguistic
problems.
I
believe
however,
that
my
conferences
with
all
these
students
thought
me
significant
things
about
writing.
Interestingly
enough,
I
would
be
taking
an
important
class,
a
senior
seminar,
in
the
Spring,
with
the
same
professor
I
worked
with
in
the
Fall.
What
I
observed
at
the
beginning
of
the
year,
to
my
surprise,
the
professor
gave
very
similar
writing
assignments
to
our
class
as
he
did
to
his
FYS.
The
most
peculiar
experience
I
had
in
that
class
was
the
fact
that
my
grade
for
the
first
paper
was
much
higher
than
the
class
average
but
not
because
the
paper
was
particularly
good
or
my
insights
incredibly
innovative.
I
simply
knew
what
the
professor
expects
from
the
paper,
I
knew
what
it
should
be
structured
like,
what
words
should
I
use
or
not
use,
just
because
of
my
'insider
knowledge'.
I
learned
that
the
professors
will
always
have
their
preferences
that
do
not
have
necessarily
anything
to
do
with
our,
the
students',
ability
to
write
well.
This
past
year
I
was
writing
a
little
bit
less
than
in
the
previous
years
because
of
the
types
of
classes
I
was
taking
but
I
noticed
that
I
do
not
pay
as
much
attention
as
I
used
to,
to
the
style
and
structure
of
my
work.
I
gained
enough
confidence
in
my
own
ability
to
write
well,
that
I
abandoned
completely
my
old
habit
of
multiple
proofreading.
This
past
year
I
left
myself
enough
time
to
research
the
content
well,
but
no
to
focus
more
closely
on
the
style.
I
believe
I
developed
a
satisfactory
writing
style
that
allows
me
to
write
on
an
acceptable
level
all
the
time.
I
feel
confident
as
a
writer.
This
statement
being
even
stronger
granted
the
fact
that
I
refer
to
writing
in
a
foreign
language.
The
language
issue
is
also
very
interesting.
I
developed
a
writing
identity
in
my
native
language,
Polish,
at
a
very
early
age.
I
was
used
to
writing
long
research
papers
but
also
literary
critiques
and
short
narratives
and
was
rather
confident
about
the
quality
of
that
writing.
Switching
to
English
proved
to
be
easier
than
I
thought
it
would
be
but
it
also
required
a
complete
change
of
my
writing
style.
Polish
is
a
language
of
long
sentences,
complicated
structures
and
intricate
grammar.
Writing
in
English
requires
different
abilities.
Today
however,
I
see
myself
as
a
writer
only
in
English.
I
lost
the
ability
of
writing
well
in
Polish,
which
brings
me
to
the
conclusion
that
we
do
not
become
good
writers
for
life.
We
need
to
practice
our
skills,
we
need
to
develop
our
style
or
else
we
lose
the
facility
of
creating
clever
sentences
and
well-structured
papers.
Working
with
students
showed
me
the
array
of
problems
they
might
have
when
they
are
faced
with
a
writing
assignment
and
at
the
same
time
I
became
aware
of
problems
I
might
face
in
the
future
and
ways
to
solve
them.
The
only
major
writing
assignment
I
had
last
year,
was
an
independent
study
paper
in
art
history.
I
was
writing
a
stylistic
analysis
of
works
by
a
certain
Italian
painter.
This
kind
of
writing
differs
greatly
from
anything
else
I
did
in
college
before
and
therefore
apart
from
researching
the
topic
of
my
paper
I
also
researched
the
form
of
writing
I
was
attempting
at.
I
read
several
analyses
of
style
written
by
various
art
historians
in
order
to
familiarize
myself
with
the
specifics
of
this
type
of
writing.
This
experience
came
in
handy
when
I
started
the
first
set
of
my
WA
conferences.
The
students
were
supposed
to
write
a
book
review
and
many
of
them
had
questions
and
doubts
about
the
required
form
of
expression.
My
advice
to
them
was
to
look
into
scholarly
journals
and
read
the
book
reviews
that
can
be
found
there.
From
the
feedback
I
got
from
students
I
know
that
my
suggestion
did
indeed
help
some
of
them
in
understanding
the
assignment.
The
most
important
writing
experience
of
last
year
however,
was
for
me
the
realization
that
I
came
to
use
writing
primarily
as
a
tool
to
express
research
findings
or
ideas.
In
the
aforementioned
art
paper,
I
did
work
on
the
form
because
it
was
unfamiliar
to
me,
I
did
not
however
focus
too
much
on
the
language,
sentence
structure
or
the
like.
The
topic
was
complicated
and
required
a
great
deal
of
thought
and
therefore
I
was
not
left
with
enough
time
and
energy
to
reread
my
paper
before
submitting
it
and
I
was
worried
about
the
outcome.
The
paper
was
given
back
to
me
with
an
A
and
hardly
any
corrections
from
the
professor
and
I
came
to
understand
that
I
write
correctly
and,
indeed,
well,
subconsciously,
without
putting
an
effort
into
it.
This
fact
influenced
the
way
I
approached
my
next
big
assignment
last
year,
but
also
my
WA
work.
On
one
hand
I
could
focus
more
on
the
content,
without
worrying
about
the
form,
on
the
other
hand
I
realized
that
it
became
hard
for
me
to
express
advice
to
students.
My
first
impulse
when
faced
with
a
student's
paper
was
to
rewrite
it,
many
a
time
I
would
hear
myself
tell
a
student:
"The
way
I
would
write
it,
is...".
The
second
big
writing
assignment
of
last
year
was
a
peace
plan
for
the
Middle
East
that
I
had
to
write
after
an
entire
semester
of
studying
the
history
of
the
Arab-Israeli
conflict.
This
assignment
was
the
most
pleasurable
writing
experience
I
had
in
college.
Creative
yet
pragmatic
and
based
in
reality
and
at
the
same
time
not
confined
with
rules
or
conventions.
I
devoted
all
my
energy
to
that
paper
and
was
very
happy
with
the
outcome
and
again
I
realized
that
for
me
writing
is
a
tool
much
more
than
a
result
in
itself.
It
is
a
tool
that
I
use
to
communicate
my
ideas
and
to
establish
a
contact
with
my
reader.
I
learned
that
putting
my
point
across
in
a
clear
and
understandable
manner
is
more
important
that
following
the
rules
that
are
often
imposed
on
writers
(by
tradition,
by
professors).
The
most
distinctive
and
the
most
difficult
problem
I
faced
last
year
as
a
WA
was
the
'perfect
paper'.
One
of
the
students
submitted
a
paper
well
and
interestingly
written,
without
a
single
mistake.
During
the
conference
we
discussed
the
assignment,
I
asked
the
student
to
tell
me
about
his
paper
and
I
still
wonder
whether
there
was
anything
else
I
could
have
done
for
him.
This
coming
year
I
plan
to
communicate
better
with
the
students
I
will
work
with
and
make
sure
that
I
give
them
advice
that
is
universal.
Advice
that
they
can
apply
to
the
paper
they
are
working
on
at
the
moment
but
also
to
the
papers
they
will
work
on
in
the
future.
I
realize
that
last
year
on
many
occasions
I
got
caught
up
in
correcting
particular
errors
in
the
papers
without
trying
to
find
the
cause
of
these
errors
in
the
student's
earlier
writing
history.
Today
I
know
that
it
is
far
more
important
to
know
that
history
in
order
to
root
out
the
errors
permanently
and
not
only
from
a
single
specific
assignment.
