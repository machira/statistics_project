If
I
am
a
writer,
then
I
am
a
writer
at
something
of
an
impasse.
Though,
surely,
every
literate
person
is
in
some
sense
a
"writer,"
there
is
something
more
to
the
term
as
I
understand
it.
To
be
a
"writer"
is
to
bend
the
written
word
to
your
needs,
to
use
writing
as
part
of
your
emotional,
intellectual
life,
to
make
language
your
own
by
using
it
for
yourself.
It
is
in
this
sense
that
I
find
myself
at
this
impasse
-
I
write,
but
not
yet
truly
for
myself.
My
earliest
memory
of
writing
is
a
fairly
unassuming
one.
That
is,
I
distinctly
recall,
not
long
after
I
had
begun
my
first
lessons
on
how
to
form
the
strokes
of
a
letter,
running
eagerly
to
my
parents
with
a
piece
of
paper
in
hand,
asking
if
the
characters
I
had
scralled
formed
a
word.
I
was
diplomatically
informed
that,
while
they
were
not
any
known
word,
perhaps
I
had
stumbled
upon
a
new
one.
They
declined
to
help
me
pronounce
my
discovery,
however.
I
also
remember
how
I
enjoyed
writing
and
illustrating
small
books
when
I
was
in
grade
school.
At
my
school,
it
was
a
common
practice
among
the
teachers
of
the
lower
grades
to
type-up
copies
of
our
work
and
have
the
pages
bound
into
small,
cloth-covered
books,
which
we
then
got
to
illustrate.
Though
I
now
forget
some
of
my
earliest
attempts
at
this
exercise
(works
such
as
"My
House,"
and
"The
Raffi
Concert"),
I
to
this
day
remember
one
of
these
"publications."
It
was
about
a
troll,
or
some
such
creature,
as
I
recall;
all
1
really
remember
is
that
this
short,
rather
affable
character
was
a
member
of
a
species
distinguishable
by
their
large,
bare
feet.
I
also
remember
a
scene
in
which
my
trol
1-hero
visited
a
house
with
a
wonderful,
very
deep
carpet.
I
am
not
sure
what
exactly
to
make
of
that
detail,
in
retrospect.
Yet
this
is
to
this
day
perhaps
the
most
pronounced
memory
I
have
of
any
of
my
early
works
of
writing.
In
perhaps
fourth
or
fifth
grade,
my
elementary
school
had
for
its
Artist
in
Residence
a
poet
-
whether
a
person
of
any
great
distinction
or
not
I
simply
do
not
know.
He
worked
with
my
class
towards
the
goal
of
staging
a
poetry
reading
towards
the
end
of
his
time
there
--
not
one
of
the
cool,
relaxed
poetry
readings
that
one
encounters
these
days,
but
something
more
akin
to
a
reading
by
Lord
Tennyson
to
a
roomful
of
Victorian
dowagers
-
a
formal
affair
requiring
proper
diction,
proper
posture,
and
proper
dress.
Or
at
least
that
is
how
I
remember
it.
While
the
reading
itself
was
somewhat
nerve-racking,
I
found
writing
the
poems
quite
a
pleasurable
experience.
I
distinctly
remember
one
poem
I
wrote
describing
a
magnificent,
luminous
golden
boat
that
I
had
encountered
a
big-city
jeweler's
shop
the
previous
summer.
I
was
rather
proud
of
that
one.
I
also
remember
a
second
poem
of
mine
that
talk
about
the
intense
color
of
blood.
I
do
not
think
that
that
one
was
quite
as
good
as
the
other.
I
know
that
my
poetry
then
was
more
than
a
trifle
silly
from
any
serious
standpoint;
in
fact,
it
was
positively
melodramatic
and
affected,
but
I
was
proud
of
it,
and
my
parents,
if
no
one
else,
said
good
things
about
it.
In
my
own
defense,
I
did
have
a
pretty
advanced
notion
of
imagery
for
my
age.
All
of
this
perhaps
planted
in
my
mind
the
idea
that
I
might
have
a
knack
for
this
poetry
stuff.
I
do
not
know
when
my
written
work
first
won
recognition
from
a
teacher;
I
am
sure
that
my
elementary
school
or
early
middle
school
teachers
gave
me
encouragement,
but
I
am
not
sure
that
they
paid
any
special
attention
to
my
writing.
Yet
I
do
distinctly
remember
how
enthusiastically
my
eighth
grade
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Davidson,
praised
my
writing,
on
more
than
one
occasion
reading
it
to
the
class
as
a
good
example.
She
would
not
tell
the
class
who's
paper
she
was
reading,
but
when
it
was
yours,
you
would
always
"know"
the
author's
identity.
This
brought
pride,
but
with
it
frustration
when
mine
was
not
the
paper
read.
Her
recognition
fixed
in
my
head
the
notion
that
I
was
a
"good"
writer.
The
idea
had
perhaps
occurred
to
me
before,
but
it
now
became
almost
a
role
I
expected
myself
to
play,
I
suppose.
My
ninth
grade
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Banks,
treated
me
similarly.
Once
again,
my
work
was
read
approvingly
to
the
class
and
consistently
given
very
high
marks.
I
came
more
and
more
to
expect
myself
to
earn
this
level
of
recognition.
As
the
year
came
to
an
end,
I
was
encouraged
by
Mrs.
Banks
to
apply
for
a
position
on
the
editorial
board
of
our
school
literary
magazine,
of
which
she
was
one
of
the
two
faculty
advisors.
Membership
in
the
board
was
won
by
taking
a
special
exam
in
which
all
of
the
candidates
had
to
weigh
the
merits
of
three
poems
-
and
have
their
merits
wieghed
by
their
responses.
Some
time
after
the
exam
was
administered,
after
the
results
showing
my
acceptance
as
the
only
sophomore
onto
the
board
were
posted,
Mrs.
Banks
informed
me
that
my
essays
for
the
exam
had
been
the
best
submitted.
My
tenth
grade
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Hansen,
showed
me
just
as
much
encouragement,
just
as
much
praise,
as
did
Mrs.
Banks
and
Mrs.
Davidson.
For
her,
we
did
a
year-long
project,
compiling
an
anthology
on
a
theme
of
our
choosing,
drawing
works
from
different
literary
genres
and
writing
a
justification
for
each
work's
inclusion.
It
was
a
somewhat
daunting
task.
When
all
was
said
and
done,
I
received
a
perfect
score
on
the
project,
and
was
informed
that
I
was
in
fact
the
first
person
in
the
many,
many
years
that
this
assignment
had
been
given
to
do
so.
That
was
a
nice
thing
to
hear.
That
same
year,
I
joined
the
literary
magazine's
editorial
board.
In
a
session
towards
the
end
of
the
year,
I
sat
in
the
committee
as
they
discussed
a
poem
that
I
had
submitted,
recommending
revisions
to
be
suggested
to
the
author.
Though
some
board
members
supported
it,
the
reaction
in
general
was
not
all
that
charitable.
I
had
never
really
involved
myself
in
any
process
of
revision.
Throughout
my
life
to
that
point,
homework
was
always
something
to
be
done
only
when
it
became
absolutely
necessary
to
have
it
done
-
in
other
words,
almost
unfailingly
it
was
done
the
night
before
it
was
due.
This
never
lent
itself
to
any
process
of
self-revision.
My
projects
for
my
teachers
had
always
been
well
receive,
my
poems
often
winning
a
great
deal
of
praise;
in
some
sense,
revision
had
not
been
necessary.
But
now
I
had
to
question
the
quality
of
my
work
--that
is,
to
look
at
it
with
a
critical
eye.
The
need
to
incorporate
the
critical
sense
that
I
was
developing
on
the
board
into
my
own
writing
would
continue
to
be
a
significant
struggle
as
I
continued
through
high
school
and
entered
college.
My
junior
year,
I
had
Ms.
Masar
for
English.
She
introduced
my
class
to
freewriting,
to
stream-of-consciousness
writing;
she
had
us
keep
a
journal
of
sorts.
Like
my
other
teachers,
she
said
very
nice
things
about
my
writing,
on
more
than
one
occasion.
But
the
thing
I
remember
most
about
her
is
what
she
said
about
one
particular
paper
of
mine.
I
do
not
remember
precisely
the
assignment
or
precisely
what
I
wrote;
I
think
my
paper
had
something
to
do
with
relating
some
literary
style
with
Impressionist
painting.
I
believe
I
got
an
A-minus
on
the
essay.
But
Ms.
Masar
told
me
something
that
sort
of
shook
me
up.
She
said
that
my
writing
was
beautiful,
but
that
I
was
convincing
by
weight
of
the
eloquence
of
my
words
rather
than
by
the
force
of
my
argument
-
she
said
that,
with
the
idea
I
was
writing
about,
my
paper
should
have
gotten
an
A-plus.
My
work
was
good,
but
it
should
be
better.
I
could
make
it
better.
I
needed
to
revise,
to
write
drafts,
to
put
some
time
into
the
thing.
I
needed
to
work
for
more
than
the
grade
-
I
could
get
that
easily
enough.
I
needed
to
work
for
the
sake
of
being
a
good
writer.
The
next
year,
I
was
required
to
do
quite
a
lot
of
writing,
not
only
for
my
English
class,
but
also
for
my
history
class.
Though
my
English
teacher
for
the
most
part
said
very
positive
things
about
my
work
-
my
A-paper
on
the
assignment
that
he
"doesn't
give
A's
on"
stands
out
in
my
memory
-
my
history
teacher,
Mr.
Hancock,
was
something
of
different
story.
Mr.
Hancock
required
that,
as
we
finished
each
unit
in
our
course,
we
submit
short-essay
answers
to
a
set
of
questions
which
he
distributed
with
our
course
materials;
there
were
usually
around
ten
questions,
and
each
essay
was
to
be
no
more
than
one
page
long.
I
detested
this
assignment.
I
have
always
procrastinated
to
some
degree,
but
with
this
assignment,
I
found
it
increasingly
difficult
to
make
myself
sit
down
and
write.
I
considered
the
questions
painfully
uninteresting,
and
I
did
not
like
the
sort
of
answers
he
was
looking
for
-
answers
straight
out
of
our
notes,
straight
out
of
the
textbook,
or
straight
out
of
some
other
source.
Not
only
would
I
put
the
assignment
off
until
the
night
before
it
was
due,
but
I
would
do
any
other
homework
I
had
first,
not
starting
to
write
until
late
in
the
evening.
Even
then
(and
remembering
that
this
was
not
college,
and
therefore
I
would
have
some
very
grumpy
parents
to
deal
with
if
I
pulled
an
all-nighter),
I
simply
could
not
make
myself
write
these
essays.
It
took
me
over
an
hour
to
write
a
half-page
of
text,
barely
able
to
write
one
miserable,
uninteresting,
uninformative
sentence
before
I
felt
the
irresistible
urge
to
get
up,
to
walk
away
from
the
computer
screen
as
though
I
could
not
bare
to
look
at
the
words
a
moment
longer.
I
frequently
barely
managed
to
complete
these
assignments
on
time.
I
believe,
however,
that
this
experience
was
more
than
a
matter
of
time
management,
or
eye
fatigue
brought
on
by
a
computer
screen;
rather,
I
think
it
is
representative
of
a
larger
problem
of
mine
as
a
writer
-
the
problem
of
self-motivation,
willing
myself
to
write
for
myself,
be
it
connected
to
an
academic
requirement
or
not.
Also
during
my
senior
year,
I
achieved
the
rank
of
editor-in-chief
of
our
literary
magazine.
Though
the
experience
was,
for
the
most
part,
an
excellent
one,
there
was
one
seeming
downside.
It
seemed
that,
the
more
time
I
spent
judging
other
people's
poetry,
looking
at
it
with
a
wholly
critical,
perhaps
sometimes
over-critical,
eye,
the
harder
I
found
it
to
write
poetry
myself.
I
became
unsure
of
myself
as
a
poet,
barely
able
to
complete
a
poem
--
and
only
truly
motivated
to
do
so
by
my
English
teacher's
policy
of
"publish
or
perish."
The
poem
that
I
got
accepted
into
our
magazine
that
year
was
in
the
very
last
group
that
we
voted
on
and
was
submitted,
in
fact,
written,
quite
some
time
after
the
deadline
for
submissions
had
already
past
-
allowed
to
slip
in
basically
because
of
my
position
and
my
friendship
with
our
advisors.
Writing
poetry
was
not
as
pleasant
as
it
had
been
when
I
was
in
fifth
grade.
At
roughly
the
same
time,
I
started
the
first
correspondence
of
any
significance
in
my
life
-
that
is,
I
started
to
write
a
fair
number
of
letters.
The
precise
reasons
why
need
not
be
discussed.
This
letter
writing
would
continue
into
my
first
two
semesters
of
college,
at
which
time
it
evolved
into
email
writing.
There
is
no
question
as
to
whether
this
is
part
of
my
formal
writing,
however;
I
frequently
write
rough
drafts
of
letters,
and
spend
as
much
as
a
few
hours
composing
some
more
serious
email
messages.
In
fact,
I
am
convinced
that
some
of
my
best
writing
has
been
in
the
form
of
letters
and
email.
Writing
for
someone
else
frees
me
to
write
for
myself,
to
form
my
ideas
into
words
and
my
words
into
ideas.
In
this
medium,
far
more
than
in
the
area
of
academic
writing,
I
enjoy
writing,
escaping
the
difficulties
and
doubts
which
I
have
come
to
feel
both
with
my
poetry
and
my
prose.
Through
my
FYS
and
my
other
academic
and
personal
experiences
during
my
first
two
semesters
at
college,
I
came
to
be
convinced
more
and
more
of
the
potential
power
of
writing
for
self-exploration,
for
communication,
and
for
the
formation
of
ideas.
I
was
required
to
write
poems
again,
and
found
myself
enjoying
it
--
and
getting
recognition
for
it
again.
I
found
that,
as
I
was
given
the
opportunity
to
write
about
subjects
which
interested
more
keenly,
I
could
better
engage
myself
as
a
writer.
Evenings
spent
reading
poetry
in
the
library
taught
me
that,
even
if
I
am
not
destined
to
be
a
poet,
I
can
perhaps
still
use
writing
as
my
own
personal
tool,
not
thinking
of
it
as
a
chore
to
be
done
for
such-and-such
a
professor,
but
rather
as
an
opportunity
to
clarify
my
own
thoughts
and
to
re-teach
myself
the
thoughts
my
courses
expose
to
me.
Yet
I
have
yet
to
learn
to
truly
write
for
myself.
While
I
have
come
close
in
my
letter
writing,
there
are
some
parts
of
my
life,
both
emotionally
and
intellectually,
that
do
not
find
their
expression
in
that
form.
Intellectually,
I
need
the
development
that
my
academic
assignments
offer
me.
But
there,
I
have
run
into
the
same
difficulty
that
I
ran
into
with
Mr.
Hancock's
assignments,
into
the
same
problem
I
encountered
with
Ms.
Masar's
comment
about
my
paper
for
her.
During
both
of
the
past
two
semesters,
I
procrastinated,
I
refused
to
write
drafts
of
paper
(unless
specifically
required),
I
found
it
almost
painfully
difficult
to
make
myself
sit
down
and
write
any
formal
assignment.
Even
when
I
had
to
work
on
a
research
paper
for
a
professor
who
I
liked
immensely,
in
a
course
in
which
I
was
very
interested,
and
on
a
subject
by
which
that
I
was
deeply
intrigued,
I
could
barely
make
myself
sit
down
and
write
the
paper,
even
as
the
due
date
loomed
dangerously
close.
Now
I
will
say
in
my
own
defense
that
I
truly
do
think
that
I
work
best
late
at
night
when
there
are
a
minimum
of
distractions
and
that
I
also
seem
to
be
most
productive
when
I
am
under
stress,
but
this
is
still
not
a
good
way
of
writing
if
one's
goal
is
to
be
as
good
a
writer
as
possible.
In
this
sense,
I
have
yet
to
let
myself
really
write
the
way
I
need
to
write;
to
write
for
myself,
I
need
to
motivate
myself
to
do
my
best,
looking
beyond
any
deadline
or
grade
to
the
pure
gain
to
be
had
from
taking
control
of
my
own
writing
process.
Not
only
do
I
have
difficulty
writing
academically,
but
I
have
the
same
difficulty
in
trying
to
write
a
journal
or
put
my
own
ideas
into
words.
I
have,
for
about
a
year
now,
fallen
into
the
habit
of
keeping
some
note-cards
or
a
small
note-pad
with
me
much
of
the
time,
so
that,
when
a
thought
that
I
consider
worth-while
occurs
to
me,
I
can
write
it
down
immediately.
I
feel
surely
that
this
individual
thoughts
can
and
should
we
further
explored,
and
in
many
cases,
woven
together,
but
I
know
that
the
way
to
achieve
this
is
through
a
more
lengthy
form
of
writing
--
through
truly
writing
for
myself.
Yet,
as
though
it
were
an
assignment
for
a
particularly
dull
and
unthoughtful
teacher
or
professor,
I
cannot
bring
myself
to
actually
sit
down
and
write.
This
is
my
dilemma,
this
is
where
the
past
six
or
so
years
of
development
and
experience
as
a
writer
have
left
me.
I
want
to
write
an
academic
paper
that
is
as
good
as
I
can
personally
make
it,
not
just
as
good
as
I
could
manage
two
in
the
morning
the
night
before
it
was
due.
I
want
to
write
to
express
myself,
to
explore
my
own
ideas.
Perhaps
it
is
melodramatic
to
think
myself
at
some
great
crossroads,
to
imagine
myself
at
a
moment
of
decision,
but
it
feels
as
though
I
am,
at
the
least,
engaged
in
a
true
struggle
--
a
struggle
with
myself,
trying
to
take
control
of
my
own
creative
process
as
a
writer
and
as
a
thinker.
