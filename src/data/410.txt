Learning

rAll

It
is
safe
to
say
that
the
2002
academic
year
was
far
from
typicalianot
bad,
mind
you,
but
far
from
the
status
quo
Lafayette
College
experience
I
had
lived
to
date.
Although
it
certainly
cannot
claim
complete
credit,
the
WA
program
was
a
major
factor
in
this
departure
from
my
academic
comfort
zone.
You
see,
almost
every
human
is
uncomfortable
with
change
despite
the
fact
that
most
people
with
a
pulse
know
that
change
is
often
the
catalyst
for
incredible
growth.
Maybe
it
is
confronting
the
unknowniathe
anxiety
that
comes
with
gambling
the
sure
thing,
letting
it
ride,
and
possibly
losing
it
all.
Or
maybe,
it
is
not
having
all
the
answers
that
frighten
us.
Well
as
it
turns
out,
I
am
as
human
as
the
next
person.
I
know
what
you
are
thinkingi
What
on
earth
does
this
have
to
do
with
writing
and
being
a
WA?
Quite
possibly,
everything.
Last
summer,
I
was
watching
the
American
film
classic
My
Cousin
Vinny.
Joe
Pesci
plays
a
street
wise,
but
green
Brooklyn
lawyer
who
is
sent
to
Alabama
to
defend
his
nephew
(the
ever-cool
Ralph
Macchio)
who
was
erroneously
charged
with
murder.
It
is
a
comedy,
trust
me.
Anyway,
one
particular
scene
in
this
film
summed
up
my
last
year
in
writing.
Marisa
Tomei,
girlfriend
of
Pesci,
had
hustled
$200
in
a
local
pool
hall
and
the
loser
had
refused
to
pay
her.
Pesci
had
gone
to
collect
from
the
deadbeat.
Vinny:
I
understand
that
you
played
a
game
of
pool
for
$200
and
lost.
Ium
here
to
collect.
Local
Redneck:
How
about
I
just
kick
you
butt?
Vinny:
Oh,
a
counter
offer.
This
is
a
tough
decision
you
give
me
here.
Get
my
butt
kicked
or
collect
200
dollars.
To
be
perfectly
honest
with
you,
I
could
use
a
good
butt
kickingi
Obviously,
Pesci
was
having
fun
at
the
dimwitted
localus
expense.
But,
as
funny
as
it
sounds
I
felt
like
my
writing
needed
a
butt
kicking.
I
had
grown
bored
of
cranking
out
the
same
predictable
history
papers.
Was
I
ready
to
walk
out
on
that
ledge?
Little
did
I
know
my
choice
had
already
been
made.
My
schedule
for
the
fall
and
my
appointment
as
a
new
Writing
Associate
made
sure
of
that.
rA
writer
is
a
person
for
whom
writing
is
more
difficult
that
it
is
for
other
people.s
Thomas
Mann
It
all
started
at
the
WA
conference.
Brimming
with
confidence
and
mentally
fresh
following
a
poolside
margarita-drenched
summer,
I
was
ready
to
showcase
my
writing
skills.
Almost
immediately
we
were
given
a
challenging
assignment
and
only
a
small
time
to
compose
our
thoughts
and
commit
them
to
paper.
I
froze.
Out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye,
I
saw
pencils
moving
feverishly
and
the
rustle
of
pages
turning
while
my
paper
remained
white.
The
blue
lines
on
my
paper
began
to
fade
and
swirl
like
hot
blacktop
as
I
blankly
stared
at
the
paper.
I
could
not
decide
what
to
write.
After
all,
I
did
not
know
for
whom
I
was
writing.
What
did
this
mystery
reader
want
to
read?
What
was
the
right
answer
to
this
assignment?
With
time
running
down
and
completely
frustrated,
I
scrawled
a
couple
of
sentences
down
and
then
spent
the
next
fifteen
minutes
trying
desperately
not
to
make
eye
contact
with
the
professors.
I
certainly
did
not
want
to
share
my
work
with
my
WA
peers.
On
the
heels
of
this
less
than
confidence
inspiring
performance
at
the
WA
conference,
I
started
the
fall
semester.
It
promised
to
be
my
most
challenging
semester
to
date
complete
with
a
notoriously
difficult
history
seminar
and
an
upper-level
political
theory
class
that
I
finessed
my
way
into
without
the
prerequisite.
Needless
to
say,
I
was
filled
with
equal
amounts
of
anxiety
and
intrepidation.
And
then,
I
met
my
first
WA
assignment,
FYS-107iaInnovations
in
Warfare.
rI
was
working
on
the
proof
of
one
of
my
poems
all
the
morning
and
took
out
a
comma.
In
the
afternoon,
I
put
it
back
again.siaOscar
Wilde
I
was
excited
by
the
FYS
assignment.
World
War
II
had
always
been
a
fascinating
subject
and,
the
way
I
figured
it,
my
seven
years
in
the
Navy
could
do
nothing
but
help.
The
first
writing
assignment
was
due
relatively
early
in
the
semester,
and
as
a
result,
my
first
round
of
conferences
were
upon
me
quickly.
The
professorus
paper
topic
was
a
straightforward,
compare-contrast
assignment.
It
appeared
to
be
a
real
lay-up
and
a
good
start
for
freshman
that
were
undoubtedly
still
struggling
with
their
new
college
lifestyle.
I
eagerly
picked
up
their
rough
drafts
and
began
leafing
through
them.
I
was
appalled.
Questions
raced
in
my
head.
What
school
taught
them
to
write
like
this?
Had
they
even
attended
school?
Through
some
catastrophic
oversight
in
admissions,
fourteen
students
were
admitted
to
Lafayette
without
attending
high
school.
None
of
the
papers
were
what
I
expected
to
see.
I
read
the
assignment
and
I
knew
the
right
way
to
attack
this
paper.
Itus
a
good
thing
they
had
me
for
a
WA.
After
all,
I
was
a
junior
with
a
whopping
seven
hours
of
training!
It
was
time
to
educate,
I
mean,
help.
Meanwhile,
in
the
aforementioned
government
and
history
classes,
I
was
getting
an
education
of
my
own.
Political
theory
requires
a
writing
style
unlike
anything
I
had
seen
before.
My
first
paper
was
returned
withi
gaspia
B!
My
narrative
in
the
history
class
did
not
fare
well
either.
This
promising
semester
was
spiraling
down
quickly;
I
had
to
rededicate
and
redouble
my
efforts,
and
I
would
start
with
the
freshman
trusted
in
my
writing
care.
I
learned
early
on
that
it
is
easy
to
pick
a
paper
apart,
especially
when
it
is
not
your
own.
This
tendency
to
over
scrutinize
can
destroy
good
writing.
I
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
grammar
is
unimportant;
but
in
the
scope
of
a
WAus
duty,
it
certainly
is
a
distant
second
to
style
and
organization.
Paradoxically,
I
was
learning
different
writing
styles
from
freshman
that
were
required
to
seek
out
my
help.
After
discussing
each
paper
with
the
author,
I
discovered
that
there
was
nothing
fundamentally
wrong
with
what
they
were
saying.
The
style
was
simply
different
from
the
way
I
was
accustomed
to
writing.
However,
as
rookies
often
do,
they
were
attempting
to
mold
their
papers
into
the
rveteranuss
vision
of
their
opinion.
This
phenomenon
seems
silly,
even
on
a
perfunctory
examination,
but
this
tragedy
happens
more
frequently
than
I
would
like
to
admit.
In
a
perfect
world,
I
could
confidently
tell
you
that
I
recognize
when
this
is
happening
and
stop
it
immediately,
but
no
sane
person
can
claim
that
we
live
in
a
perfect
world.
I
think
the
best
we
can
hope
for
as
WAus
is
to
keep
the
writerus
voice
in
the
writing.
In
that
FYS,
there
were
some
fantastic
writers
that
I
know
have
influenced
my
own
writing
style.
My
final
narrative
for
American
intellectual
history
used
some
techniques
that
I
was
first
exposed
to
while
helping
a
fellow
writer,
who
happened
to
be
a
freshman.
A
lesson
was
learned.
Never
write
off
the
rookies.
I
never
did
make
the
call
about
those
diplomas.
rSay
all
you
have
to
say
in
the
fewest
possible
words,
or
your
reader
will
be
sure
to
skip
them;
and
in
the
plainest
possible
words,
or
he
will
surely
misunderstand
them.siaJohn
Ruskin
We
have
a
tendency,
as
students,
to
overstate.
Ok,
overstate
may
be,
well,
overstating.
I
think
that
procrastination
has
a
large
hand
in
it.
An
old
Marine
sergeant
used
to
tell
me
to
rIf
you
donut
know
what
you
want
to
say
exactly,
dazzle
them
with
BS.s
Early
on,
savvy
students
learn
that
you
can
say
eight
pages
of
nothing
eloquently.
I
believe
that
no
one
exemplifies
that
adage
better
than
the
average
college
sophomore.
These
seasoned
college
veterans
know
exactly
how
to
maximize
their
effort
by
which
I
mean
they
can
bang
out
a
serviceable
ten-page
paper
in
four
hours.
My
VAST
class
in
the
spring
semester
was
filled
with
such
sophomores.
I
am
well
read
but
some
of
these
authors
used
words
I
had
never
seen
before.
I
confronted
one
student
who
used
the
word
contumely
not
once,
but
twice
in
the
same
paragraph.
I
asked
if
she
could
use
contumely
in
a
sentence
that
did
not
appear
on
her
paper.
She
looked
me
in
the
eye
and
said,
rI
am
not
exactly
sure
if
I
know
what
contumely
means.s
Well,
it
was
at
least
a
sentence.
I
had
to
give
her
that.
That
got
me
to
thinking.
If
I
am
consistently
seeing
this
trend,
I
wonder
if
I
have
ever
done
it
myself.
I
went
rummaging
through
my
file
of
graded
papers
from
the
past
year.
As
it
turns
out,
I
was
(and
still
am,
undoubtedly)
guilty
of
the
same
crime.
There
is
an
old
police
adage
that
says
to
catch
a
criminal
you
have
to
think
like
a
criminal.
I
am
not
trying
to
imply
that
writers
who
are
liberal
with
a
thesaurus
are
criminals
and
should
be
fined
or
jailed.
But
it
was
obvious
why
I
identified
their
thinly
veiled
attempts
to
obscure
the
meaning
of
their
writings;
I
was
a
card-carrying
member
as
well.
I
was
determined
to
figure
out
why
we,
as
student
writers,
would
use
words
that
detracted
from
our
writing.
The
answer
was
obvious.
We
did
not
know
what
we
wanted
to
say.
My
VAST
students
had
opened
my
eyes
to
the
fact
that
we
were
all
trying
to
dazzle
with
BS.
It
all
came
back
to
procrastination.
The
problem
with
waiting
until
the
last
minute
to
write
a
paper
is
that
it
is
the
last
minute.
Wait,
I
know,
it
sounds
a
little
too
much
like
Kung-Fu
theater
philosophyiaso
patently
obvious
that
it
must
be
profound.
It
is
even
simpler
than
that.
I
have
never
completely
bought
into
the
idea
of
writing
papers
well
before
they
are
due
and
allowing
some
incubation
period
where
the
paper
will
suddenly
mature
like
fine
wine.
Frankly,
I
write
my
best
under
extreme
stress.
I
am
talking
about
the
kind
of
stress
that
would
make
an
air-traffic
controller
snap.
In
fact,
I
am
writing
this
paper
on
the
day
before
it
is
due
despite
the
fact
that
the
English
department
was
kind
enough
to
send
it
out
in
June.
With
that
in
mind,
it
might
be
tempting
to
say
that
I
have
not
learned
a
damn
thing
about
writing
and
that
the
last
paragraph
is
irrelevant
filler.
Just
about
half
of
that
is
rightiaalmost.
In
the
zero
hour,
it
is
not
the
writing
that
suffers
as
much
as
the
thought
behind
the
writing.
With
45
minutes
notice,
I
could
write
a
four-page
paper
on
the
feeling
of
sailing
into
the
Persian
Gulf
on
a
warship.
Similarly,
I
could
produce
500
words
on
the
1999
New
York
Yankees
in
less
than
an
hour.
The
reason
is
simple:
I
have
thought
about
both
of
those
subjects
in
great
length.
There
is
no
substitute
for
preparedness
when
it
comes
to
writing.
I
would
not
feel
the
need
to
hide
behind
obscure
adjectives
because
I
would
know
exactly
what
I
wanted
to
say.
More
importantly,
I
would
want
the
reader
to
understand
the
message
I
was
trying
to
convey
because,
ideally,
it
would
be
well
reasoned
and
thought
provoking.
You
may
disagree;
that
is
your
prerogative,
which
brings
me
to
my
last
point.
rAbout
the
most
originality
that
any
writer
can
hope
to
achieve
honestly
is
to
steal
with
good
judgment.siaJosh
Billings
One
thing
that
writing
this
paper
has
brought
to
light
is
how
writers
sometimes
imitate
one
another.
It
is
not
a
theft
of
substance,
but
rather
a
borrowing
of
certain
aspects
of
style.
From
the
tenured
professor
to
the
greenhorn
freshman,
we
are
constantly
experimenting
and
hopefully
evolving
as
writers.
However,
writing
is
a
craft
that
does
not
reward
complete
imitation.
My
last
year
of
writing
has
taught
me,
if
nothing
else,
this
vital
fact:
Without
the
authors
voice,
sterility
sets
in
irreparably.
Many
times,
the
WA
end
of
meetings
is
little
more
than
well-orchestrated
sound
bites.
I
used
to
worry
about
that,
but
the
past
year
has
taught
me
differently,
hence
the
quotes
that
are
randomly
inserted
throughout
this
paper.
Taking
chances
and
being
true
to
the
vision
of
the
paper
is
the
best
advice
a
WA
can
both
give
and
receive.
That
way,
both
participants
in
the
conference
are
able
to
ante
up,
learn
from
the
experience,
and
grow
as
writers.
