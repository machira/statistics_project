Some
of
my
earliest
childhood
memories
involve
writing
and
the
English
language.
Being
the
oldest
of
three
children,
I
received
constant
attention
during
my
early
stages
of
maturation.
My
parents,
especially
my
mother
who
spent
the
majority
of
her
days
with
me,
always
explored
methods
of
increasing
my
intelligence
and
stimulating
my
mind
at
an
early
age.
My
mother
went
as
far
as
to
purchase
literature
illustrating
methods
of
stimulating
the
minds
of
toddlers
and
even
infants.
My
mother
and
father
would
consistently
read
to
me
before
I
went
to
bed,
and
I
always
sat
quietly
and
listened,
regardless
of
my
ability
to
comprehend
the
material.
I
was
able
to
fully
recite
the
alphabet
well
before
my
developing
friends
were
able
to
do
so.
Even
at
the
ages
of
two
and
three,
I
can
remember
my
mother
taking
me
to
friends'
and
relatives'
houses,
and
she
proudly
showed
how
quickly
I
had
developed
at
my
tender
age.
I
would
sing
songs
and
dance
before
most
of
my
peers
were
forming
semi-coherent
sentences.
My
fascination
with
learning
and
being
challenged
was
not
limited
to
speaking
and
writing,
but
stretched
across
almost
all
subject
matter.
As
a
three
year
old
I
was
taken
to
a
child
psychologist
who
observed
my
development
and
abilities.
I
was
presented
with
basic
challenges
dealing
with
logic
and
physical
abilities.
After
observing
my
behavior,
the
doctor
told
my
parents
that
he
had
never
seen
a
child
with
such
confidence
in
his
abilities.
Almost
to
a
fault,
I
felt
I
could
do
anything
in
the
world.
Once
the
regimen
of
testing
was
completed,
I
sought
out
other
means
of
flaunting
my
skills
to
the
doctor
and
my
parents.
I
still
remember
betting
the
doctor
that
I
could
cross
the
monkey
bars
that
were
present
in
the
facility,
something
I
subsequently
did.
My
zeal
for
life
and
my
drive
to
do
my
best
in
all
aspects
of
my
young
existence
were
very
instrumental
in
shaping
my
writing
in
grade
school.
In
the
early
grades
writing
and
the
English
language
became,
once
again,
second
nature
to
me.
My
first
grade
class
would
consistently
take
spelling
tests
on
a
weekly
basis.
Without
fail,
these
tests
would
include
ten
words
that
were
given
to
the
class
the
prior
week.
Refusing
to
even
glance
at
the
words
prior
to
examination
time,
I
would
confidently
scribe
the
correct
answers
on
our
half
sheets
of
brown,
recycled
paper
and
wait
proudly
for
my
test
to
return
with
a
large
"10/10"
written
on
the
top.
The
customary
grade
school
sticker
with
"way
to
go"
or
"nice
job"
could
always
be
found
next
to
my
score.
Near
the
end
of
first
grade,
I
successfully
passed
a
reasoning
test
for
placement
into
the
gifted
program.
In
a
class
that
met
biweekly
in
place
of
my
regular
schooling,
I
was
given
the
resources
and
attention
needed
for
further
development
of
my
academic
interests.
The
class,
with
exception,
was
structured
almost
as
a
guide
for
its
young
students
to
consult
as
they
explored
their
own
ideas.
In
it,
I
often
read
and
composed
poetry.
Although
my
interests
were
again
not
limited
to
reading
and
writing,
I
undertook
many
projects
and
participated
in
many
activities
related
to
the
English
language.
One
of
the
more
memorable
projects
I
completed
was
in
the
form
of
a
childrens'
book
that
I
wrote
and
illustrated.
My
love
for
art
began
at
an
early
age,
and
I
felt
that
writing
a
childrens'
book
would
display
my
ability
to
write
on
a
specific
level
and
illustrate
exactly
what
I
had
in
mind
while
I
was
writing.
The
story,
which
I
wrote
in
second
grade,
was
about
a
young
snake
and
his
mother.
The
snake's
mother
tried
to
teach
her
son
not
to
go
outside
by
himself
because
the
owl
was
always
looking
for
a
convenient
meal.
The
young
snake,
however,
was
overcome
with
curiosity
and,
one
day,
went
outside
alone.
After
a
day
of
excitement
and
adventure
culminating
with
a
dangerous
owl
encounter,
the
young
snake
learned
to
listen
to
his
mother's
advice.
Writing
this
book
allowed
me
to
combine
art
and
writing,
both
areas
that
I
used
to
and
very
much
still
do
enjoy.
My
grade
school
approached
writing
differently
than
other
grade
schools
did.
Our
short
works,
which
were
always
composed
on
paper
with
overly
large
spaces
between
lines,
were
not
critiqued
or
corrected
the
way
other
grade
schools
did
so.
Instead,
teachers
focused
simply
on
content
and
ideas.
This
was
done
not
to
encourage
poor
grammar
with
frequent
misspellings,
but
rather
was
an
attempt
to
make
reading
and
writing
an
enjoyable,
creative
process
for
our
young
minds.
Elementary
school
writing
became
less
mathematical
with
respect
to
grammatical
rules.
The
style
of
teaching
that
I
experienced
in
my
early
grade
school
years
undoubtedly
had
a
positive
effect
in
my
later
compositions.
As
elementary
school
continued,
my
written
works
showed
more
maturity
and
creativity.
My
vocabulary
quickly
improved
at
a
young
age
which
affected
my
writing
both
positively
and
negatively.
Many
of
my
works
were
significantly
enhanced
by
my
more
mature
style
of
writing.
Teachers
would
often
comment
how
immense
my
vocabulary
had
become.
However,
I
fell
into
the
trap,
as
many
young
writers
do,
where
my
writing
style
focused
too
much
on
word
choice
and
too
little
on
coherence
and
proper
transitions.
Often,
I
found
myself
focusing
excessively
on
specific
words
in
a
written
work
rather
than
overall
content.
I
can
still
recall
intently
analyzing
my
thesaurus
in
hopes
of
finding
a
synonym
that
neither
my
classmates
nor
my
teachers
had
ever
heard.
Often
I
found
that
the
word,
although
a
synonym
in
some
instances,
did
not
function
correctly
in
my
specific
sentences.
Some
teachers
would
suggest
that
I
place
less
emphasis
on
vocabulary
and
spend
more
time
improving
the
overall
flow
of
my
writing
samples.
At
the
time,
my
stubborn,
know-it-all
attitude
prevented
me
from
taking
that
advice
seriously.
I
felt
that
their
advice
would
not
actually
improve
my
writing;
instead,
I
felt
that
the
advice
was
simply
a
suggestion
that
would
hinder
the
maturation
of
my
writing.
Although
my
overzealous
pursuit
of
intellectually
superior
written
works
often
set
my
writing
back,
compositions
became
a
perfect
outlet
for
my
adolescent,
creative
mind.
My
writing
in
grade
school
was
definitely
among
the
most
creative
writing
I
had
accomplished
in
my
life.
Regardless
of
the
assigned
writing
topic,
I
would
always
find
a
way
to
write
the
most
creative
story
I
could
derive.
In
third
grade
I
can
remember
receiving
an
assignment
that
instructed
the
students
to
write
about
a
lively
day
in
the
autumn.
The
exercise
was
supposed
to
be
a
showcase
of
the
students'
abilities
to
use
good
description,
particularly
when
describing
the
September
leaves
and
atmosphere.
My
paper,
however,
took
a
completely
different
approach.
It
began
normally;
the
first
paragraph
painting
a
vivid
picture
of
an
autumn
stroll
down
the
sidewalk.
Careful
attention
was
paid
in
describing
the
descending
leaves
and
colorful
foliage.
The
second
paragraph,
however,
took
a
strange
turn.
After
seeing
two
shadowy
figures
in
the
window
of
my
vacationing
neighbors'
home,
I
decide
to
investigate
and,
armed
with
my
space
age
weaponry,
I
fend
off
an
evil
team
of
aliens
determined
to
destroy
the
earth.
Writing
became
a
means
of
sharing
my
premature
ideas
with
my
family
and
friends,
a
purpose
I
continue
to
utilize
today.
As
my
education
progressed,
my
interests
and
areas
of
focus
developed
and
altered.
After
elementary
school
and
through
middle
school,
I
continued
to
excel
in
a
broad
range
of
subjects.
A
poor
mark
on
my
report
card
was
a
rarity,
and
because
of
this
I
became
very
confident
in
my
intellectual
abilities.
As
I
grew
older,
I
was
always
under
the
impression
that
persons
of
the
highest
intellect
were
interested
in
and
found
success
in
scientific
fields.
My
more
intelligent
friends
were
all
intrigued
by
science,
and
I
almost
associated
some
sort
of
inferiority
in
all
other
subjects.
Scientific
and
mathematical
revolutionists
such
as
Albert
Einstein
and
Frank
Lloyd
Wright
were
among
the
individuals
I
idolized.
Being
very
confident
in
my
abilities,
I
decided
that
following
a
scientific
track
was
the
only
way
to
fully
reach
my
potential.
I
did
continue
on
an
honors-based
English
curriculum
throughout
my
education;
however,
I
concentrated
my
attention
on
my
science
and
math
classes.
Feeling
that
my
time
could
be
used
more
effectively
elsewhere,
I
would
sometimes
put
in
less
than
a
maximum
effort
on
my
high
school
English
assignments.
Many
of
my
assignments
were
not
properly
proofread,
an
obvious
sign
that
the
overall
quality
of
my
work
was
not
among
my
priorities.
My
growing
disinterest
in
writing
and
the
English
language
was
only
increased
during
my
eleventh
grade
honors
English
class.
The
honors
class
I
entered
in
eleventh
grade
was
thought
to
be
the
most
difficult
English
course
offered
in
the
school
district.
The
class
was
taught
by
one
of
the
most
elder
teachers
in
the
district,
Mr.
Leininger.
Ironically,
this
particular
teacher
taught
my
mother
during
his
earliest
teaching
days.
My
mother
would
always
rave
about
how
excellent
a
teacher
Mr.
Leininger
was
and
how
much
he
cared
about
the
students
and
influenced
her
in
her
adolescence.
I
was
very
eager
to
meet
such
an
influential
and
powerful
educator.
My
first
day
of
eleventh
grade
English
class
remains
a
very
lucid
memory.
Mr.
Leininger
did
indeed
remember
my
mother
as
a
student.
He
did
not
neglect
to
make
it
obvious
how
fondly
he
thought
of
her
abilities
as
a
student
and
how
arduously
she
worked
during
her
high
school
English
career.
Mr.
Leininger
went
as
far
as
to
describe
her
as
"his
favorite
student
of
all
time."
Unfortunately
for
me,
Mr.
Leininger
expected
my
interest
in
reading
and
writing
to
rival
that
of
my
mother's,
something
that
was
simply
not
the
case.
My
class
schedule
was
very
difficult
for
an
eleventh
grade
program;
it
consisted
of
two
AP
science
classes
with
honors
classes
in
English
and
history
to
accompany
the
required,
general
curriculum.
My
interests
were
mostly
in
the
scientific
fields,
and
some
of
my
early,
somewhat
mediocre
efforts
in
that
class
were
met
with
rather
negative
results.
It
was
obvious
that
I
needed
to
increase
my
work
effort
in
order
to
raise
my
grade.
I
meticulously
began
to
handle
my
assignments,
carefully
crafting
my
essays
and
diligently
reading
the
required
material.
Much
to
my
dismay,
the
work
that
I
considered
"excellent"
continued
to
receive
less
than
excellent
results.
Try
as
I
might,
I
was
unable
to
consistently
produce
work
worthy
of
A's.
I
was
extremely
discouraged
by
this,
and
came
to
the
realization
that
English
was
too
subjective
a
course.
My
work
was
undeniably
on-par
with
my
peers'
efforts;
however,
they
were
rewarded
with
the
highest
grades
while
I
was
rewarded
with
much
less.
My
mother
also
felt
that
my
work
was
being
graded
unfairly,
but
there
was
really
not
too
much
that
could
be
done.
Discouraged,
I
enrolled
in
a
general
English
class
the
following
year,
the
first
time
I
had
enrolled
in
a
non-accelerated
class
during
my
high
school
career.
My
twelfth
grade
English
class
may
still
be
considered
the
easiest
class
I
have
ever
taken.
My
efforts
in
that
particular
class
were
minimal
at
best,
and
my
results
were
nothing
less
than
immaculate.
The
class
provided
no
challenge
whatsoever,
which
I
very
much
relished
at
the
time.
My
focus
remained
on
science.
By
this
time
I
began
to
consider
medical
school
as
my
future.
Just
as
I
had
convinced
myself
to
take
a
science
based
curriculum,
I
was
incidentally
influenced
to
believe
that
the
most
intelligent
individuals
commenced
a
career
in
medicine.
While
anatomy
and
chemistry
never
appealed
to
me,
I
thought
appreciation
for
the
material
would
increase
as
I
studied
it.
I
enrolled
at
Lafayette
College
determined
to
progress
my
career
as
a
medical
doctor.
My
freshman
schedule
was
undeniably
centered
on
a
scientific
track.
Before
entering
the
school
year,
I
decided
that
my
major
should
be
biochemistry,
and
I
structured
a
course
schedule
consistent
with
the
major.
My
general
biology
and
general
chemistry
classes
did
not
present
a
significant
challenge.
I
was
well
experienced
in
the
two
subjects
from
my
detailed
high
school
studies,
and
the
courses
were
basically
a
review.
The
class
lectures
themselves
were
excruciating;
I
had
very
little
interest
in
the
subject
matter
which
I
attributed
to
the
fact
that
the
classes
were
of
a
"general"
format.
As
an
eventual
upperclassman,
I
looked
forward
to
the
freedom
I
would
have
to
explore
specific
topics
in
the
scientific
fields.
Meanwhile,
my
freshman
FYS
writing
course
took
a
different
turn
than
I
had
anticipated.
Eager
to
start
my
college
career
on
the
right
foot,
I
endeavored
to
remain
up
to
date
with
my
work.
I
spent
an
appropriate
amount
of
time
preparing
my
essays
for
the
class.
After
reviewing
my
works,
I
realized
that
the
creativity
I
was
commended
for
in
elementary
school
was
still
a
vital
part
of
my
works.
Other
aspects
of
my
style,
however,
had
matured
and
improved.
While
my
grammar
had
always
been
stellar,
my
coherence
greatly
improved.
One
assignment,
a
creative
piece
centered
in
Mexico,
required
imagination
as
well
as
proper
mechanics.
I
was
amazed
at
how
well
I
constructed
the
story;
it
was
a
five
page
piece
on
the
theft
of
some
artifacts
from
an
ancient
Aztec
temple.
Not
only
was
I
able
to
generate
an
imaginative
story,
something
I
had
not
attempted
in
many
years;
but
I
was
also
able
to
incorporate
excellent
descriptive
details
that
flowed
nicely.
With
a
regimen
of
research
papers
being
my
most
recent
writing
efforts,
it
was
refreshing
to
write
a
piece
that
went
a
whole
new
direction.
I
was
actually
able
to
integrate
the
research
paper
style,
one
that
had
excellent
grammar
and
carefully
chosen
vocabulary,
with
the
style
I
began
to
develop
in
my
early
writing
years.
What
made
the
paper
even
more
effective
were
the
developing
coherence
and
pertinent
transitions
used
in
the
work.
My
writing
continued
to
improve
as
college
advanced.
My
style
and
clarity
continued
to
improve
into
my
sophomore
year.
While
taking
mandatory
writing
classes,
I
proceeded
in
my
science
curriculum.
However,
my
grades
were
not
up
to
my
usual
standards.
I
was
having
trouble
with
the
workload,
and
my
efforts
to
find
a
solution
to
this
predicament
were
largely
futile.
I
altered
my
study
habits
on
a
weekly
basis.
Although
my
grades
were
by
no
means
terrible,
they
were
not
where
I
expected
them
to
be,
especially
if
I
planned
to
enroll
in
medical
school.
I
finally
came
to
the
realization
that
my
slight
academic
decline
was
not
due
to
the
amount
of
time
and
energy
I
invested
in
the
classes,
but
rather
was
a
byproduct
of
my
general
apathy
toward
the
subject
matter.
Despite
my
best
effort,
the
topics
discussed
in
my
advanced
science
classes
neither
excited
nor
interested
me
whatsoever.
It
was
obvious
that
I
did
not
enjoy
science
as
much
as
I
had
thought
and
hoped
I
did,
but
my
experiences
in
Lafayette's
college
writing
classes
showed
me
what
did
in
fact
interest
me.
I
really
did
enjoy
the
language,
reading
and
writing
it,
and
I
decided
that,
rather
than
push
myself
towards
a
goal
I
knew
I
would
never
savor,
I
should
concentrate
on
something
that
I
found
interesting
and
rewarding.
I
decided
to
become
more
involved
in
the
writing
program
at
Lafayette,
changing
my
major
to
a
more
English-based
curriculum.
Feeling
that
my
writing
had
the
potential
to
considerably
improve,
I
resolved
to
immerse
myself
much
more
often
in
the
language.
My
interest
in
becoming
a
WA
was
a
direct
result
of
this
resolution.
During
the
year
I
hope
to
guide
students
through
their
writing
dilemmas
while
I
improve
my
own
writing,
something
that
I
think
will
happen
simple
through
the
constant
exposure
to
others'
written
works.
My
writing
has
definitely
progressed
throughout
my
lifetime,
and
I
hope
that
it
will
persist
in
making
positive
strides
during
my
tenure
as
a
WA.
