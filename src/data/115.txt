Literacy
Narrative
W.A.
Workshop--Fall
1997
Elementary
school
has
become
a
bit
blurry,
especially
in
the
whirlwind
of
the
college
years,
but
what
I
remember
quite
clearly
is
that
I
decided
at
an
early
age
that
both
reading
and
writing
were
extremely
boring
and
something
I
could
do
without.
I
did
well
enough
in
class,
but
I
didn't
enjoy
it--the
readings
didn't
hold
my
attention
and
I
had
no
desire
to
write
beyond
the
requirements
of
school.
Writing,
as
far
as
I
could
tell,
consisted
of
practicing
row
upon
row
of
cursive
letters
and
writing
the
week's
spelling
list
in
sentences.
Who
needed
it?
I
remember
being
in
third
grade
when
my
mom
started
buying
me
a
series
of
books
about
a
little
girl
named
Ramona
Quimby
by
Beverly
Cleary.
Once
I
started
reading
I
couldn't
stop.
I
adored
those
books
because
I
felt
as
if
I
was
going
on
all
the
adventures
of
the
story
with
Ramona.
Not
long
after
I
began
reading
this
series
my
teacher
assigned
me
to
write
a
report
on
a
book
of
my
choice.
Naturally
I
choose
one
of
my
Ramona
books,
and
for
the
first
time
the
writing
came
easily.
It
wasn't
boring
at
all
because
I
was
actually
enjoying
myself.
I
continued
reading
lots
of
books
on
my
own,
but
it
wasn't
until
several
years
later
that
I
began
to
explore
writing.
I
kept
a
journal
beginning
when
I
was
in
seventh
grade
and
at
first
I
just
wrote
about
my
activities
during
the
day--what
I
ate,
what
games
I
played,
what
I
learned
in
school.
I
never
offered
any
commentary
or
reactions--just
a
simple
recording
of
activities.
Then
I
started
writing
about
the
boys
I
had
crushes
on
and
my
insecurities
as
a
teen-ager.
I
started
to
realize
how
free
I
could
be
when
I
was
writing.
Writing
in
my
journal
was
almost
like
I
was
telling
someone
a
story--it
helped
me
think
things
through,
or
cool
off
if
I
was
angry.
Before
long
I
was
writing
pages
and
pages,
but
it
was
all
unstructured
thoughts.
The
journal
was
my
personal
belonging
so
I
didn't
care
if
it
would
make
sense
to
anyone
else--it
was
just
thoughts
that
poured
out
as
I
was
thinking
them.
Writing
in
a
journal
was
the
extent
of
my
creative
abilities
outside
of
the
classroom
until
my
junior
year
in
high
school.
I
was
recommended
for
an
advanced
placement
program
course
and
it
required
a
bit
more
than
I
was
used
to,
but
it
was
a
challenge
and
I
enjoyed
it.
Towards
the
end
of
the
year
my
class
was
reading
The
Color
Purple,
a
novel
which
is
told
through
a
series
of
letters.
My
teacher
assigned
us
to
write
a
paper
about
anything
we
wanted
using
the
same
format.
An
open
ended
assignment
with
no
true
question
to
answer?
I
panicked.
What
in
the
world
could
I
possibly
write
about?
I
spent
more
time
worrying
than
I
did
thinking,
as
I
have
a
tendency
to
do,
until
finally
I
thought
of
something
that
I
might
be
able
to
write
about.
My
grandmother
had
spent
the
better
part
of
the
past
two
years
battling
cancer
and
she
had
passed
away
just
before
the
assignment
was
given.
I
could
barely
deal
with
her
death
in
my
own
mind
and
it
wasn't
my
style
to
be
so
personal
in
my
writing,
but
for
some
reason
I
wanted
to
put
it
down
on
paper.
The
assignment
clicked
for
me--it
came
out
exactly
the
way
I
wanted
it
to
and
my
professor,
who
had
praised
my
writing
in
the
past,
called
it
my
best
work
to
date.
I
felt
that
for
the
first
time
I
had
expressed
myself
the
way
I
wanted
to
be
understood.
The
experience
with
that
assignment
prompted
me
to
try
writing
more
personal
pieces--poetry,
short
stories--just
things
for
myself,
usually
about
people
I
knew
or
things
that
had
happened
to
me.
This
type
of
writing
combined
with
the
standard
research/report
style
typically
given
in
high
school
gave
me
a
chance
to
really
work
on
my
style
and
I
thought
I
was
a
pretty
good
writer.
And
then
I
started
writing
for
my
college
classes.
All
of
a
sudden
my
writing
was
too
vague
,
my
sentences
too
choppy
and
I
lacked
smooth
transition
.
What?
I
was
getting
good
enough
grades
but
I
wasn't
satisfied.
Somewhere
along
the
line
I
began
taking
writing
seriously
so
the
sudden
barrage
of
criticism
was
a
big
deal.
Finally
the
professor
I
was
assigned
to
for
my
first
year
seminar
sat
me
down
for
a
chat
and
told
me
that
I
had
to
start
paying
attention.
He
told
me
he
thought
I
was
extremely
bright
and
that
I
had
a
lot
of
potential
(I
guess
so
he
wouldn't
totally
devastate
my
ego)
but
that
I
didn't
pay
close
enough
attention
to
what
I
was
writing.
It
was
the
truth
and
I
realized
that
I
wasn't
half
the
writer
I
thought
I
was--I
had
a
lot
to
learn.
The
next
time
I
was
assigned
a
paper
I
did
thorough
research
and
then
tried
to
imagine
that
I
was
going
to
be
reading
whatever
I
was
writing.
It
was
a
whole
different
perspective--it
made
me
realize
that
my
style
failed
to
guide
the
reader
because
I
wrote
as
if
the
reader
was
inside
my
head.
Paying
attention
to
what
I
was
writing
should
have
been
the
most
obvious
and
basic
step
to
take
towards
good
writing,
but
I
didn't
start
until
my
freshmen
year
in
college.
Once
I
did
my
writing
improved
tremendously
and
I
started
getting
excellent
grades
and
positive
comments
and
I
thought
to
myself--I've
got
this
writing
thing
figured
out.
I
remember
when
I
received
the
first
paper
I
wrote
for
an
Advanced
Writing
class
I
took
my
sophomore
year--not
a
sentence
was
left
unmarked.
It
seemed
as
if
there
was
nothing
right
about
the
entire
paper
and
I
remember
the
overwhelming
feeling
of
frustration,
because
I
had
worked
hard,
yet
the
paper
obviously
wasn't
close
to
being
good
enough.
I
think
the
semester
that
I
took
that
class
taught
me
more
about
writing
than
I
had
ever
thought
I
would
know.
I
began
trying
to
show
the
reader
how
I
got
from
one
idea
to
the
next
and
to
present
and
argue
ideas
in
my
own
way.
It
was
this
class
that
finally
made
me
realize
that
I
would
never
be
a
perfect
writer,
but
knowing
that
made
me
a
good
writer.
I
think
I
have
learned
quite
a
bit
about
writing,
particularly
in
the
three
years
I
have
spent
at
Lafayette.
The
attention
to
detail
is
the
most
important
I
think.
A
writer
must
be
aware
of
who
the
audience
is
and
write
accordingly.
It
is
important
for
college
writers
especially,
to
address
the
questions
that
are
being
asked.
The
most
well
written
paper
does
not
deserve
a
high
mark
if
it
does
not
answer
thoroughly
the
question
proposed.
I
think
a
good
writer
also
needs
to
pay
attention
to
their
sentence
structure
and
word
choice.
A
paper
can
contain
the
necessary
information
and
answer
the
question
but
a
poor
presentation
can
ruin
its
effect.
A
professor
I
had
suggested
that
I
write
a
draft
of
a
paper
and
then
not
work
on
it
for
a
few
days.
I
tried
this
and
when
I
re-read
my
original
draft
I
was
amazed
at
how
many
areas
sounded
unclear
or
awkward,
even
to
my
own
ears
days
after
I
had
written
the
exact
words
thinking
they
sounded
wonderful.
My
writing
has
changed
quite
a
bit
over
the
years,
but
the
one
constant
is
that
I
am
aware
that
I
don't
know
everything
and
that
I
can
always
improve.
