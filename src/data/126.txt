Over
the
course
of
my
life
my
feelings
toward
writing
have
changed
greatly.
At
a
very
young
age
I
concluded
that
writing
was
not
for
me
because
of
the
struggles
that
I
had
encountered.
For
me,
writing
was
an
unnecessary
chore
brought
about
by
disgruntled
teachers
that
were
not
willing
to
prepare
exams.
This
attitude
stayed
with
me
for
a
number
of
years,
in
fact,
the
first
papers
that
I
actually
enjoyed
writing
did
not
arrive
until
my
freshman
year
of
college.
Since
that
time,
I
no
longer
see
writing
as
chore
but
as
a
challenge
to
create
an
articulate
work
based
on
my
opinions
and
feelings.
My
earliest
memories
of
writing
are
from
a
very
young
age.
I
can
still
remember
the
short
messages
to
my
mother
that
I
would
attach
to
my
finger
paintings
and
collages
in
kindergarten.
Of
course,
none
of
the
words
were
mine
and
I'm
sure
that
they
were
not
at
all
legible,
yet
I'll
never
forget
my
mother's
expressions
upon
their
arrival.
However,
the
feelings
of
happiness
that
copying
words
off
the
board
brought
soon
changed
to
frustration.
With
the
arrival
of
second
and
third
grade
came
the
task
of
producing
my
own
words
and
sentences,
a
task
not
welcomed
by
a
boy
with
a
limited
vocabulary
and
poor
reading
skills.
Because
of
this,
my
projects
continued
to
be
works
of
plagiarism
as
I
borrowed
a
tiny
piece
from
each
student.
Despite
my
god
given
ability
to
edit,
I
was
not
able
to
fool
my
third
grade
teacher,
Mrs.
Graff.
It
was
under
her
tutelage
that
I
began
to
sharpen
my
reading
skills
which
in
time
elevated
my
ability
to
write.
Over
the
next
two
years
my
writing
skills
blossomed.
During
this
time
I
could
not
get
my
hands
on
enough
writing
assignments.
In
fact,
my
writing
became
so
strong
that
one
of
my
teachers
recommended
journalism
as
a
possible
career
to
my
parents.
However,
this
new
found
success
made
me
complacent
and
once
again
writing
became
a
chore.
Unfortunately,
I
new
that
my
writing
had
come
so
far
that
I
could
wait
until
the
last
minute.
Because
of
this,
I
would
hand
in
unresearched
work
and
still
due
a
sufficient
enough
job
to
receive
good
grades.
This
lack
luster
attitude
stayed
with
me
throughout
grammar
school
and
into
high
school.
I
know
that
my
negative
feelings
toward
writing
have
affected
my
present
work
because
of
a
lack
of
experience.
Because
I
viewed
writing
as
a
chore
rather
than
a
hobby,
I
never
wrote
for
the
sake
of
writing.
Unlike
most
English
majors
I
meet,
I
never
wrote
poetry,
pros,
or
kept
a
diary
as
a
child.
My
writing
consisted
of
school
assignments
such
as
personal
essays
and
book
reports.
Upon
entering
High
School,
my
writing
was
probably
still
above
average
despite
my
negative
outlook.
Because
of
this,
I
continued
to
write
only
for
scholastic
purposes.
When
a
paper
was
due
I
wrote
it
and
that
was
the
end.
On
one
occasion
a
poem
that
I
wrote
was
recommended
to
an
English
teacher
as
a
possible
edition
to
the
school
paper.
After
reading
the
poem
the
teacher
summoned
me
and
suggested
that
we
meet
after
school.
When
I
met
the
teacher
she
told
me
that
with
a
few
after
school
sessions
we
could
polish
the
work
enough
to
not
only
put
in
the
paper
but
to
also
enter
in
the
school's
poetry
contest.
Because
I
viewed
this
as
unnecessary
writing,
I
denied
her
request
and
never
entered
the
contest.
Months
later,
the
same
teacher
suggested
that
I
come
write
for
the
school
newspaper
and
the
yearbook
committee,
once
again
I
decided
against
the
added
writing
assignments.
This
attitude
stayed
with
me
for
much
of
high
school,
in
fact,
it
was
not
even
partially
swayed
until
the
end
of
my
senior
year.
As
a
requirement
for
graduation,
all
seniors
must
hand
in
a
term
paper
on
a
possible
career
choice.
Similar
to
most
high
school
assignments,
this
term
paper
was
to
be
handed
in
periodically
in
separate
sections.
Once
again,
every
one
of
my
sections
was
done
at
the
last
minute,
just
enough
to
receive
an
acceptable
grade.
However,
unfitting
to
my
master
plan
when
my
stack
of
sections,
that
had
been
prepared
for
grades
only,
was
returned
they
did
not
equal
a
paper.
Instead,
I
was
left
with
a
pile
of
index
cards
and
pages
that
resembled
a
number
of
book
reports.
Unfortunately,
my
teacher
also
knew
of
my
feelings
towards
writing
and
this
was
her
chance
to
teach
me
a
lesson
about
the
preparation
needed
for
acceptable
college
work.
Unfortunately,
this
last
minute
lesson
left
me
with
only
one
weekend
to
write
a
term
paper
that
was
required
for
graduation.
Obviously,
the
paper
was
finished,
I
actually
received
a
very
good
grade,
and
I
learned
my
lesson.
However,
unknown
to
Miss
Debow,
her
lesson
taught
me
a
lot
more
than
she
had
hoped.
Her
goal
was
to
teach
me
about
the
need
for
preparation
and
research.
Her
lesson
was
successful
because
as
I
researched
and
wrote
my
paper
that
Saturday
afternoon
I
fell
in
love
with
writing.
For
the
first
time
since
I
was
in
the
fourth
grade
I
truly
enjoyed
putting
words
on
paper
and
reading
the
end
result.
Unfortunately,
her
mission
to
teach
me
a
lesson
about
preparation
was
not
fully
accomplished,
because
once
again
I
received
a
quality
grade
on
last
minute
work.
However,
I
can
definitely
say
that
that
one
weekend
in
June
prepared
me
for
my
college
writing
more
than
any
other
string
of
events
in
my
four
year
career.
Despite
my
new
found
love
for
writing,
I
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
jump
right
into
college
as
an
English
major.
As
my
freshman
year
at
Siena
progressed
it
became
more
and
more
evident
to
me
that
I
would
be
declaring
myself
as
an
English
major.
As
I
had
hoped
writing
remained
fun
for
me
and
I
continued
to
enjoy
not
only
my
end
products
but
the
entire
production.
My
most
memorable
work
from
freshman
year
was
not
an
English
assignment
but
a
History
one.
I
was
assigned
a
fifteen
page
paper
on
the
history
of
woman's
clothing
in
Europe.
Obviously,
I
definitely
was
enjoying
the
act
of
writing
by
this
time
because
the
topic
sure
wasn't
interesting.
Anyway,
I
had
made
it
through
my
longest
writing
assignment
to
date
and
I
still
was
interested,
so
I
knew
this
feeling
was
for
Sophomore
year
was
even
more
enjoyable
because
of
the
addition
of
more
English
classes
to
my
curriculum.
With
three
English
classes
in
the
first
semester
alone,
I
had
all
of
the
writing
assignments
that
I
could
handle.
Yet,
I
still
enjoyed
every
paper
and
continued
to
look
forward
to
the
next.
In
fact,
I
came
to
the
point
were
I
would
hope
for
papers
rather
than
exams,
no
matter
what
the
required
length.
While
registering
for
classes
for
the
second
semester
I
recalled
the
suggestion
of
my
fifth
grade
teacher
and
enrolled
in
a
Journalism
class.
Unfortunately,
my
teacher
was
not
a
professor
but
a
local
newspaper
reporter
and
she
conducted
our
class
as
if
it
was
an
assignment
and
not
a
lecture.
On
the
first
day
she
told
us
that
the
only
way
to
improve
our
writing
was
through
practice
and
that
was
what
we
were
going
to
do.
Although
my
writing
improved
my
journalism
skills
did
not.
Upon
the
return
of
our
work
we
would
read
comments
such
as
this
is
a
good
article
but
it
wouldn't
be
published
in
my
paper!
These
comments
were
not
accompanied
by
any
instruction
and
because
of
this
I
was
turned
off
of
journalism.
The
next
significant
writing
that
I
can
remember
doing
that
year
was
a
throwback
to
the
writing
I
had
been
doing
two
years
before.
Once
again,
I
found
myself
writing
college
essays
as
I
prepared
to
transfer.
Luckily,
I
only
had
to
write
one
but
during
the
process
I
looked
back
at
the
essays
I
had
written
only
two
years
before.
The
improvement
was
amazing
and
once
again
my
feelings
towards
writing
became
even
stronger.
My
first
year
at
Lafayette
has
produced
an
even
greater
improvement
in
my
writing
skills.
Even
upon
the
conclusion
of
my
summer
classes
last
year
I
felt
that
the
professors
had
helped
my
by
leaps
and
bounds.
Similarly,
throughout
the
first
semester,
the
input
that
I
received
from
both
my
professors
and
my
WA's
molded
me
into
a
much
stronger
writer
both
grammatically
and
structurally.
However,
it
was
not
until
the
second
semester
that
I
feel
I
really
felt
confident
about
my
writing.
After
the
completion
of
a
few
papers
one
of
my
professors
recommended
that
I
apply
for
a
position
as
a
WA.
In
the
past,
I
had
thought
of
applying
but
never
felt
my
writing
was
strong
enough.
Fortunately,
she
convinced
me
the
day
before
the
applications
were
due.
As
I
prepared
my
application
and
went
through
the
interviewing
process
I
began
to
feel
confident
enough
in
my
writing
to
help
others.
I
feel
that
I
will
be
successful
as
a
WA
because
their
are
a
number
of
student's
at
Lafayette
who
feel
the
same
way
I
used
to
about
writing.
I
believe
that
my
previous
bouts
with
poor
writing
skills
and
a
lack
of
confidence
will
help
me
when
working
with
others.
In
conclusion,
my
feelings
about
both
the
processes
of
writing
and
my
ability
to
write
have
changed
drastically
over
the
years.
In
this
time
I
have
gone
from
a
total
lack
of
confidence
to
the
belief
that
I
will
be
able
to
help
others
with
their
problems.
Similarly,
I
feel
that
through
this
program
not
only
will
I
be
able
to
help
others
but
I
also
believe
that
my
writing
will
continue
to
improve.
