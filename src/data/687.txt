While
writing
exists
in
many
different
forms
and
styles,
all
writing
shares
the
common
purpose
of
portraying
oneOs
opinions
or
ideas
concerning
a
specific
subject
matter.
Throughout
my
life,
I
have
come
to
appreciate
this
function
of
writing
through
the
various
different
methods
IOve
used
to
write
and
the
different
writing
exercises
IOve
been
required
or
chosen
to
complete.
My
first
significant
memory
of
writing
is
from
first
grade,
when
I
wrote
a
sports
column
for
the
weekly
school
bulletin.
I
would
begin
my
articles
at
home
at
the
kitchen
table
with
a
pencil
and
paper
and
then
finish
them
during
class
time
while
I
sat
to
the
side
and
typed
up
what
I
had
written
on
one
of
the
computers.
As
I
was
lucky
enough
to
attend
my
live
sporting
events
in
person,
I
would
try
to
write
about
a
game
IOd
actually
been
to
that
week
(unfortunately
this
was
not
always
possible)
and
coined
the
catchphrase
NI
was
thereO
as
the
signature
line
of
all
of
my
pieces.
What
I
remember
most
about
these
early
writing
experiences
was
the
ease
with
which
I
was
able
to
write
and
how
natural
and
enjoyable
it
felt
to
be
writing
the
articles.
Being
an
avid
sports
fan,
writing
articles
about
my
greatest
passion
was
a
pleasure
rather
than
a
chore.
It
did
not
feel
as
though
I
was
being
forced
to
do
something
or
even
that
I
had
a
task
to
complete
but
rather
that
my
writing
was
a
manifestation
of
my
enjoyment
and
exploration
of
sporting
events.
I
loved
watching,
playing
and
analyzing
sports;
I
wasnOt
required
to
write
in
this
instance
but
rather
I
choose
to
write
in
order
to
try
and
engulf
myself
in
the
topic
I
loved
as
much
as
possible.
While
this
particular
early
writing
experience
was
not
the
most
structured,
it
required
imagination
and
creative
and
to
this
day
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
writing
experiences
I
have
ever
had,
making
it
invaluable
to
my
overall
development
as
a
writer.
One
of
my
next
memorable
writing
experiences
came
in
fifth
grade
when
I
encountered
a
new
form
of
writing
that
I
had
yet
to
experiment
with:
poetry.
I
had
just
moved
overseas
to
London,
where
I
still
live
today,
and
our
class
held
a
poetry
unit
in
which
each
of
us
was
required
to
create
our
own
portfolio
consisting
of
a
selection
of
different
styles
and
forms
of
poetry.
While
moving
to
England
had
immediately
created
some
challenges
in
terms
of
writing
as
a
result
of
slight
differences
in
spelling
and
style
between
two
different
dialects
of
English,
experimenting
with
a
new
form
of
writing
for
the
first
time
was
altogether
a
different
challenge.
Writing
poetry
involved
following
a
specific
structure
and
often
there
were
predetermined
rules
that
had
to
be
adhered
to
D
the
trick
was
to
allow
these
rules
and
structures
to
aide
you
as
writer
rather
than
letting
them
holding
you
back.
While
poetry
did
present
new
challenges
for
me
as
a
writer,
in
many
ways
it
reminded
me
of
my
early
writing
days
for
the
school
bulletin.
Just
as
previously
I
was
writing
about
my
passions
and
what
most
interested
me,
poetry
gave
me
a
further
opportunity
to
explore
topics
of
interest
and
even
more
intimately
express
my
emotions.
In
a
poem,
I
could
start
with
any
topic
I
wanted
and
express
whatever
opinions
I
held
towards
it
in
the
manner
I
deemed
appropriate.
While
this
was
certainly
not
my
last
experience
with
poetry,
I
will
always
remember
it
as
the
time
when
I
discovered
poetry
as
a
viable
way
to
express
oneOs
feeling
and
thoughts
through
writing.
As
I
advanced
through
the
school
years,
I
remember
my
academic
writing
requirements
existing
in
many
different
formats.
In
my
middles
and
early
high
school
years,
I
was
required
to
complete
many
different
projects
that
involved
writing.
Many
of
these
involved
writing
that
was
accompanied
by
visual
features
such
as
posters
or
diagrams
that
helped
aide
the
writing.
Without
a
doubt,
my
most
memorable
writing
project
from
this
time
period
was
my
essay
for
my
personal
project.
The
personal
project
was
a
project
that
every
ninth
grade
student
at
my
school
was
required
to
complete
as
the
culmination
of
the
middle
years
program
D
the
project
was
very
open
and
allowed
the
students
to
undertake
any
activity
or
venture
that
they
were
interested
in.
For
my
project,
I
elected
to
hold
a
charity
auction
for
Special
Olympics.
While
the
soliciting
of
items
for
donation
and
the
preparation
for
night
of
the
auction
took
most
of
my
efforts,
it
was
an
analytical
essay
on
the
entire
process
that
I
was
required
to
write
which
was
evaluated
and
in
turn
assessed
as
the
sole
factor
influencing
my
final
grade.
The
combination
of
having
to
fit
several
months
of
complicated
procedures
into
a
single
essay
and
having
to
accomplish
the
task
at
as
high
a
level
as
possible
due
to
the
significance
of
the
essay
made
for
a
unique
writing
experience.
As
I
had
accomplished
so
much
with
my
project,
I
felt
a
pressure
to
convey
all
my
achievements
to
an
acceptable
degree
through
my
written
words.
My
personal
project
was
one
of
the
first
times
I
discovered
the
significance
of
writing
and
how
crucial
it
can
be
when
it
comes
to
portraying
significant
moments.
By
the
time
I
reached
my
junior
year
of
high
school,
I
had
experimented
with
many
different
forms
of
writing
as
is
explained
above.
However,
it
was
when
I
reached
this
year
of
my
academic
progress
that
I
faced
the
greatest
educational
task
of
my
life
to
that
point:
the
International
Baccalaureate.
The
IB,
as
it
is
called,
is
a
program
that
takes
place
during
the
final
two
years
of
high
school
and
requires
a
student
to
take
six
subjects,
three
at
higher
level
and
three
at
standard
level.
From
the
moment
I
began
the
IB,
I
was
aware
that
the
demands
on
the
quality
and
thoroughness
of
my
writing
were
going
to
be
greater
than
ever.
Perhaps
the
greatest
challenge
presented
by
the
IB
was
the
emphasis
of
the
importance
of
research
that
was
place
on
our
work.
Whereas
in
our
early
high
school
years
we
had
focused
on
presenting
our
ideas
on
the
paper,
we
were
now
being
asked
to
incorporate
the
ideas
of
others
and
to
blend
these
ideas
with
our
own
to
create
a
cohesive
argument.
My
IB
experience
helped
shift
my
perception
of
writing
from
a
presentation
of
only
my
opinions
to
a
collection
of
ideas
and
information
that
is
considered
and
then
portrayed
by
an
individual.
This
realization
and
the
incorporation
of
research
into
my
writing
was
certainly
an
important
step
for
me
as
a
writer.
If
the
IB
program
marked
a
step
up
in
terms
of
the
required
level
of
competence
as
a
writer,
then
college
was
also
certainly
another
rung
on
the
ladder.
While
the
IB
improved
me
as
a
writer,
I
realized
once
I
arrived
at
Lafayette
and
began
classes
that
there
were
greater
demands
still
to
be
met.
In
the
early
stages,
I
found
myself
having
to
adapt
quickly
to
the
new
demands
of
college
writing
and
realized
that
I
would
have
to
improve
further
as
a
writer
to
meet
the
increased
demands
of
the
collegiate
level.
Perhaps
the
greatest
difference
I
found
between
high
school
and
college
writing
was
the
level
of
detailed
analysis
that
was
required
for
writing
at
the
college
level.
For
example,
when
writing
about
literature,
it
was
no
longer
sufficient
to
only
identify
major
themes
and
symbols
from
texts
and
summarize
them
in
a
paper.
Instead,
it
was
now
necessary
to
look
at
the
specific
language
in
a
text
and
identify
specific
moments
in
a
text
that
lent
themselves
to
the
major
themes
and
concepts
of
the
work.
Similarly,
when
looking
at
a
historical
source,
the
main
ideas
and
facts
of
the
text
could
not
just
be
summarized
but
rather
specific
quotes
and
significant
passages
had
to
be
recognized
and
appropriately
analyzed
in
my
own
writing.
This
emphasis
on
detail
and
using
specific
evidence
to
support
a
written
argument
is
one
of
the
many
things
I
have
learned
as
a
writer
since
coming
to
Lafayette.
Finally,
one
of
the
aspects
of
college
writing
I
have
most
enjoyed
is
creative
writing.
For
years,
almost
all
of
my
writing
had
been
focused
on
academics
and
research
paper
and
little
time
was
left
for
the
kind
of
creative
writing
I
had
enjoyed
so
much
as
a
kid.
However,
at
Lafayette
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
take
creative
writing
courses
that
I
have
thoroughly
enjoyed.
While
the
level
of
writing
in
these
courses
is
certainly
greater
than
the
one
from
first
grade
and
my
NI
was
thereO
articles,
I
have
found
the
same
amount
of
enjoyment
and
passion
in
being
able
to
explore
my
creative
side
as
I
did
back
then.
Furthermore,
I
have
found
that
the
skills
I
have
learned
throughout
my
years
as
an
academic
writer
have
been
extremely
useful
and
have
helped
me
to
be
able
to
present
my
creative
pieces
in
a
coherent
and
engaging
manner.
Out
of
all
of
my
academic
experiences
in
college,
I
am
most
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
be
able
to
use
the
writing
skills
that
I
have
acquired
over
the
years
in
a
creative
manner.
Whether
it
is
a
greeting
card
or
a
PHD
thesis,
writing
is
an
invaluable
way
of
expressing
emotion,
information,
and
opinions.
I
have
learned
many
things
about
writing
over
the
course
of
my
life
and
know
that
I
will
continue
learning
as
I
continue
to
write
more
and
gain
experience.
