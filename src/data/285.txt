Beth
For
as
long
as
I
can
remember,
I
have
always
enjoyed
learning
and
writing,
but
not
because
of
any
deeply
rooted
yearning
for
knowledge.
I
have
enjoyed
school
and
liked
my
classes
and
writing
assignments
because
they
have
always
been
easy
for
me.
I
could
grasp
concepts
and
memorize
things
word
for
word
without
much
unnecessary
thought.
As
I
get
older,
I
realize
that
I
have
cheated
myself
because
of
my
ease
in
the
classroom.
Only
trying
hard
enough
to
get
grades
deemed
acceptable
has
made
it
difficult
for
me
as
I
progress
to
new
heights
in
my
education.
In
the
schools
I
have
attended
throughout
my
academic
career,
creative
thinking
and
independent
writing
have
always
been
stressed.
I
fulfilled
my
duties
as
a
student
writer
with
pleasure,
enjoying
writing
because
it
was
a
simple
task.
I
breezed
through
the
advanced
writing
and
literature
classes
in
both
grade
and
high
school
both
unscathed
and
undaunted.
Even
as
my
classes
failed
to
challenge
me,
I
also
failed
to
challenge
myself
by
going
the
extra
few
steps
to
make
a
good
paper
a
great
paper,
or
to
strive
for
the
best
I
could
possibly
produce.
Remembering
my
earliest
writing
attempts,
what
comes
to
mind
most
clearly
is
an
old
Macintosh
computer.
In
the
third
grade,
my
best
friend
Kelly
and
I,
practically
attached
at
the
hip
as
we
were,
sat
in
front
of
her
Mac,
and
having
thus
exhausted
every
other
function
of
the
computer,
discovered
the
wonderful
world
of
word
processing.
I
would
make
up
poems
and
Kelly
would
type
them
out,
seeing
as
my
typing
skills
were
hardly
substantial.
I
have
yet
to
find
the
floppy
disk
we
saved
the
poetry
on,
but
it
is
surely
awash
with
the
hearty
literature
that
only
a
nine
year
old
can
unlock.
I
remember
my
frequent
trepidation
at
impending
writing
assignments.
I
would
dread
each
grade
because
of
the
increasing
amount
of
writing
that
was
required
of
me.
The
beginning
of
fourth
grade
was
a
particular
burden
because
it
was
the
first
year
we
were
required
to
participate
in
the
Invention
Convention.
This
milestone
was
the
real
initiation
into
life
on
the
second
floor
of
St.
Luke's
School.
Gone
were
the
days
of
being
on
the
first
floor
with
the
Kindergarteners
and
the
First,
Second,
and
Third
graders.
Fourth
grade
was
the
time
to
leave
your
childhood
behind,
and
begin
the
long
road
to
the
eighth
grade.
Unfortunately,
this
road
began
with
the
Invention
Convention,
a
frightening
task.
I
was
anxious,
not
for
lack
of
imagination,
for
any
fourth
grader
has
a
long
list
of
perfect
inventions
to
ease
the
trials
of
everyday
life
that
they
would
be
more
than
willing
to
unleash
had
they
the
time
and
the
eager
listener,
but
because
of
the
two
page
report
which
was
required
to
accompany
the
aforementioned
Invention.
In
accordance
with
my
tendency
to
procrastinate,
I
put
off
writing
the
report
till
the
night
before
the
project
was
due,
and
per
usual,
I
got
an
acceptable
grade.
Another
particularly
intimidating
writing
assignment
was
my
Independent
Study
Project
(ISP)
in
my
junior
year
of
high
school.
I
dreaded
the
coming
of
this
seven
page
analysis
of
three
related
literary
works.
Although
it
was
not
much
longer
than
other
papers
I
had
written
in
the
past,
this
paper
was
used
to
help
determine
placement
in
the
Advanced
Placement
(A.P.)
English
class.
No
different
from
in
fourth
grade,
except
the
stakes
were
higher,
I
began
the
paper
the
night
before
it
was
due,
and
eked
out
a
paper
that
was
given
a
B-,
which
fortunately
balanced
out
by
my
high
quiz
and
test
grades.
My
grades,
combined
with
a
score
of
5
on
my
English
Language
A.P.
exam,
made
me
eligible
to
be
placed
in
the
A.P.
English
class.
My
senior
year
of
high
school
was
more
difficult
for
me
than
the
years
before.
I
was
unable
to
whiz
through
papers
as
I
had
in
the
past,
and
was
required
to
put
more
thought
into
my
writing,
but
I
was
seldom
interested
in
the
subjects
the
papers
were
to
be
written
about,
so
again,
I
put
no
more
effort
into
my
writing
than
necessary.
The
first
time
I
realized
that
writing
could
be
a
rewarding,
worthwhile
pursuit,
was
when
I
was
required
to
write
a
final
paper
for
my
A.P.
Art
History
class
at
the
end
of
my
senior
year.
As
usual
I
didn't
begin
my
paper
until
a
week
or
so
before
it
was
due,
but
as
the
due
date
approached,
I
became
more
and
more
enthralled
with
the
subject
of
my
paper,
the
history
of
gravestone
artwork.
Researching
my
subjects
by
observing
them
first
hand
in
cemeteries
in
my
area,
then
supplementing
this
with
information
from
the
Internet,
helped
me
to
come
to
the
realization
that
not
all
analytical
writing
had
to
be
done
with
the
aid
of
books
that
seemed
like
they
hadn't
been
lifted
off
the
shelves
for
decades.
This
seems
such
a
simple
realization,
hardly
an
epiphany,
but
this
was
truly
a
turning
point
in
my
writing
career.
This
began
the
point
in
my
life
where
I
began
really
writing
for
my
own
enjoyment,
and
realizing
the
power
of
words.
Since
then,
I
have
begun
writing
in
a
journal,
and
I
also
write
down
quotations
that
I
see
or
hear
that
move
me.
I
have
also
begun
writing
poetry
whenever
I
feel
strongly
about
something,
and
talking
about
it
just
doesn't
seem
fitting.
It
was
with
this
new
approach
to
writing
that
I
entered
Lafayette
College.
I
was
very
excited
about
going
away
to
college,
the
appeal
of
living
on
my
own
and
making
new
friends
glittered
delightfully
in
my
mind.
I
was
apprehensive
about
the
work
load,
but
having
become
friendly
with
my
First
Year
Seminar
(FYS)
instructor
before
classes
began,
I
entered
college
optimistically.
Given
that
the
majority
of
my
courses
were
very
broad-based
lecture
classes,
I
didn't
expect
any
of
them
to
be
terribly
interesting.
The
only
class
I
looked
forward
to
unfailingly,
every
day,
was
my
FYS.
This
class
was
not
only
my
most
interesting
class
that
semester,
but
it
was
one
of
the
more
interesting
writing
classes
I
had
ever
taken.
The
lecture
material
was
engaging,
and
the
topic,
Evil
in
Western
Society
was
finally
an
issue
that
I
enjoyed
discussing.
Unlike
my
classes
in
the
past,
the
literature
we
investigated
was
applied
many
aspects
of
our
society.
We
then
used
various
media
available
to
further
analyze
and
evaluate
our
theories.
By
bringing
this
topic
across
the
boundaries
into
all
areas
of
our
society,
our
professor
thusly
engaged
our
entire
class
in
worthwhile
discussions
and
investigations.
Since
coming
to
college,
not
only
have
my
ideas
about
writing
changed,
but
also
my
entire
outlook
on
learning.
I
have
developed
an
unquenchable
thirst
for
knowledge.
Every
new
thing
I
learn
simply
heightens
the
realization
that
I
know
only
a
very
small
portion
of
the
vast
pool
of
information
available
to
me.
This
yearning
for
knowledge
opens
up
an
entirely
new
set
of
problems
for
me,
as
I
am
sure
it
also
does
for
others
who
have
also
had
an
easy
time
of
school.
At
this
point
in
my
life,
I
am
in
the
process
of
teaching
myself
to
learn.
Because
of
lack
of
experience
in
doing
so,
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
absorb
information
rather
than
simply
memorizing
and
regurgitating
it.
I
am
not,
however,
proposing
that
I
have
not
learned
anything
in
my
time
at
school,
for
one
invariably
learns
things,
at
the
very
least,
inadvertently,
and
even
animals
are
said
to
learn.
I
am
suggesting
that
I
have
infrequently
gone
out
of
my
way
to
learn
anything,
so
now
I
am
forced
to
sit
myself
down
and
be
patient
enough
to
take
in
what
I
need
to
be
well-versed
in
my
field
and
to
stimulate
my
mind.
This
is
what
I
refer
to
when
I
say
I
have
cheated
myself.
I
have
not
taken
advantage
of
all
that
has
been
offered
to
me
in
the
past,
and
have
put
myself
at
a
disadvantage.
Others
who
have
had
to
struggle
through
their
classes,
thereby
appreciating
that
which
they
have
learned,
have
received
a
far
more
valuable
education
in
that
realization
than
students
such
as
myself
have
received
throughout
our
entire
academic
careers.
