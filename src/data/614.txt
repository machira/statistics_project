Summer
Assignment

August

"Cher
Journal,
Demain
je
celebre
mes
dix
ans!!
On
vient
de
terminer
la
decoration
pour
ma
fete
d'anniversaire
et
je
trouve
qu'elle
est
parfaite.
Il
y
a
des
ballons
roses
partout
ansi
que
des
banderoles
et
du
confetti
(...)"
Suddenly
I
was
back
in
1999,
looking
at
my
younger
self
as
she
scribbled
feverishly
in
her
diary
in
an
attempt
to
convey
in
words,
the
excitement
she
felt
for
her
upcoming
birthday
party.
Bewildered,
I
jerked
around
trying
to
get
my
bearings
and
pinched
myself
to
see
if
I
would
wake
up.
"One's
past
is
what
one
is.
It
is
the
only
way
by
which
people
should
be
judged.
Oscar
Wilde
-poet,
dramatist"
I
jumped
at
the
voice
and
twisted
round
to
face
the
intruder,
but
was
amazed
to
see
Eoin
Colfer,
my
favorite
author
when
I
was
growing
up.
Puzzled,
I
wondered
what
he
was
doing
in
my
dream...
"I
saw
you
struggling
with
the
WA
assignment.
I
know
you
get
anxious
when
you
have
to
write
about
yourself.
So,
I
thought
I
would
take
you
for
a
walk
down
memory
lane
and
remind
you
what
type
of
writer
you
are".
Feeling
uneasy
that
the
man,
who
has
written
such
amazing-beyond-description
stories,
might
see
my
most
embarrassing
writing
moments,
I
quietly
turned
back
to
watch
Little
continue
her
narrative
in
French.
I
have
always
been
proud
of
my
background
which
is
comparable
to
a
colorful
quilt.
I
was
born
in
Mauritius,
a
tropical
island
where
one
might
use
English
to
write
a
school
essay,
read
the
newspapers
in
French
and
chat
in
Creole,
Bhojpuri
or
Hindi
with
a
friend.
This
cultural
diversity
is
reflected
in
the
maturity
of
my
writing
for
I
have
seen
first
hand
how
showing
compassion,
tolerance
and
interest
can
blossom
into
a
friendship
so
nurturing
that
sometimes
I
wonder
how
others
do
without
the
experience.
"J'espere
que
toutes
mes
amies
pourront
venir
et
qu'elles
passeront
une
journee
inoubliable
(...)"
continued
Little
as
she
expressed
her
doubts
and
nervousness
about
the
flow
of
scheduled
events
for
her
party.
What
she
wanted
above
all
was
for
her
friends
to
have
fun!
"You
see,
writing
can
be
personally
rewarding
and
enriching;
an
outlet
for
your
anxieties
rather
than
a
cause
of
them"
noted
Eoin
Colfer.
Indeed,
for
many
years
I
have
kept
a
journal,
a
place
where
I
expressed
my
thoughts
and
feelings
about
the
different
experiences
in
my
life.
My
journal
was
a
private
place
that
no
else
ever
visited
and,
without
the
pressures
of
deadlines
or
grades,
such
private
writing
was
relaxing,
therapeutic
and
even
fun.
As
I
thought
about
that,
Little
finished
her
entry
for
the
night,
got
up
and
stashed
the
thick
diary
behind
the
dictionaries
lining
the
shelf
in
her
room.
I
felt
a
freezing
breeze
blow
across
my
face
and
I
shivered.
I
wrapped
my
arms
around
my
body
and
closed
my
eyes
as
the
breeze
intensified.
The
next
moment
everything
was
calm
and,
curiously
I
peeked
through
my
semi-closed
eyelids,
wondering
what
had
just
happened.
I
jumped
back
and
bumped
into
a
wall
when
I
realized
that
I
had
landed
in
a
classroom
full
of
students
following
an
English
course.
We
were
now
in
2004.
"What
did
you
expect?
A
car
which
can
burst
through
time
and
space
in
a
multicolored
tunnel
with
past
events
from
your
life
swirling
by?
If
you
ask
me,
the
time
travelling
scenes
in
Back
To
The
Future
were
so
overkill"
Incredulous
that
Eoin's
only
reaction
to
time
travelling
was
his
annoyance
at
the
scenes
of
a
movie
which,
according
to
him,
did
not
reflect
"reality",
I
was
about
to
bombard
him
with
questions
when
the
teacher's
homework
assignment
caught
my
attention.
"For
next
week,
you
are
to
write
an
essay
about
the
following:
If
you
had
to
be
someone
else
for
one
day,
who
would
that
be
and
why"
That
is
when
I
saw
my
teenage
self,
sitting
at
the
front
row,
with
her
eyes
sparkling
because
she
had
just
had
an
inventive
idea.
I
remembered
that
day;
I
knew
exactly
who
I
wanted
to
write
about
and
I
also
knew
that
no
one
else
would
have
thought
of
writing
about
him.
"Without
creativity,
there
would
be
no
progress,
and
we
would
be
forever
repeating
the
same
patterns.
Edward
de
Bono
-
physicist,
author"
I
understood
the
suitability
of
Eoin's
quote
because
during
that
period
of
my
life,
I
strived
to
stand
out.
I
had
developed
a
unique
sense
of
style
and
embraced
my
artsy
persona.
I
would
research
for
hours
about
a
new
painting
technique,
spend
a
fortune
on
yarn
when
I
decided
to
take
up
crochet
class,
I
also
secretly
tried
poetry
and
spent
hours
reading
because,
as
Carl
Ally
-
CEO
of
Ally
&
Gargano
Advertising
Corp
had
once
said,
"the
creative
person
wants
to
be
a
know-it-all.
He
wants
to
know
about
all
kinds
of
things:
ancient
history,
nineteenth-century
mathematics,
current
manufacturing
techniques,
flower
arranging,
and
hog
futures.
This
is
because
he
never
knows
when
these
ideas
might
come
together
to
form
a
new
idea.
It
may
happen
six
minutes
later
or
in
six
months,
or
even
in
six
years
down
the
road.
But
he
has
faith
that
it
will
happen."
As
I
watched
my
teenage
self
rush
to
the
library
to
borrow
autobiographies
and
news
articles
about
Lance
Armstrong,
I
realized
that
freewriting
had
never
been
my
style.
I
never
felt
comfortable
to
just
grab
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
and
compose
at
the
same
time
as
new
ideas
flashed
into
my
brain.
I
wrote
best
only
when
I
had
developed
a
clear
list
of
topics
and
subtopics
that
I
wanted
to
cover
and
did
enough
research
to
strengthen
the
quality
of
my
work.
In
fact,
before
starting
any
draft,
I
needed
to
gather
as
many
notes
as
possible
to
deepen
my
understanding
of
the
context
around
my
topic;
first
by
developing
a
broad
understanding,
and
then
later
going
into
depth.
I
smiled
as
I
noticed
how
my
"writing
kit"
had
evolved;
the
pink
pens
and
thick
diary
were
replaced
by
a
sleek
laptop
connected
to
the
internet
and
to
a
printer.
There
were
bookmarked
books,
opened
books
and
loose
sheets
of
notes
scattered
on
the
desk
and
on
the
floor
as
Teen
touch
typed
her
essay
on
Microsoft
Word.
Her
fingers
were
flying
across
the
keyboard
as
she
incorporated
a
very
recent
statement
that
Lance
made
on
his
website
into
her
essay;
I
could
feel
the
passion
that
possessed
her
when
she
was
creating
something
unique
and
offering
the
reader
up-to-date
information.
Then
I
remembered
how
that
Essay
Episode
of
my
life
ended:
my
English
teacher
was
extremely
pleased
with
my
work,
mentioning
that
it
was
not
only
inspired
but
also
well
developed,
and
then
she
started
to
read
it
aloud
to
the
whole
classroom.
I
was
mortified,
paralyzed,
I
could
not
breathe
anymore.
Even
though
I
shied
away
from
conformity,
I
was
not
ready
to
have
the
whole
class
judge
my
work,
to
tear
it
down
to
pieces
and
analyze
every
word...
At
that
moment,
I
felt
the
breeze
on
my
face
again
and
braced
myself
for
another
jump
in
time.
I
was
in
my
summer
course
which
took
place
just
a
few
months
after
the
Essay
Episode.
Teen
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
room
with
around
thirty
other
students
and
mentors
staring
at
her
as
she
tried
to
deliver
her
speech
about
Eczema;
a
skin
condition.
After
stuttering
and
blanking
repetitively,
she
managed
to
get
to
the
end
of
it.
"The
public
is
wiser
than
the
wisest
critic.
George
Bancroft
-
historian,
statesman."
Eoin
knew
exactly
what
issue
Teen
was
facing
at
that
time.
She
felt
inadequate
and
confused,
thinking
that
yet
again
she
had
failed
to
meet
the
objective
as
she
noticed
more
and
more
yawns
spreading
across
the
crowd.
That
year's
course
dealt
with
public
speaking
and
we
were
to
write
and
give
short
talks
on
the
topic
of
our
choice,
while
keeping
in
mind
the
objectives
of
the
week
such
as:
improving
our
communication
skills,
mastering
our
body
language
or
getting
our
point
across.
However,
Teen
was
inexperienced
with
that
type
of
writing
which
involved
an
audience
larger
than
a
single
person;
her
teacher.
Yet,
on
that
day,
she
learnt
more
about
"good
writing
principles"
than
she
actually
expected.
"I
really
liked
the
distinctiveness
of
your
topic
and
I
discovered
a
lot
about
it
from
what
you
covered
but,
I
found
it
kind
of
hard
to
follow
when
you
used
too
many
specific
medical
terms
and
at
time
I
had
trouble
understanding
your
argument.
On
the
other
hand,
your
explanation
was
well
structured"
commented
a
student
from
the
audience.
After
a
speaker
ends
his
speech,
he
must
yield
the
floor
to
questions
and
constructive
criticism
but
usually,
Teen
did
not
receive
much
input
since
most
students'
attention
would
drift
after
her
first
couple
of
sentences
and
hence
they
would
not
have
much
to
contribute
at
the
end
of
the
speech.
Yet,
that
one
observation
seemed
to
generate
a
lot
of
nods
from
the
others.
Mulling
over
that
as
she
walked
back
to
her
seat,
it
unexpectedly
hit
her
that
good
writing
was
much
more
than
just
correct
writing,
it
was
writing
that
responded
to
the
interests
and
needs
of
her
readers
and
listeners.
Remembering
that
the
popularity
of
my
speeches
increased
after
I
had
carefully
identified
the
members
of
my
audience
and
tuned
into
them,
I
realized
that
as
a
writer,
I
always
tried
to
analyze
who
I
was
writing
for
and
tailor
my
work
to
their
expectation,
while
still
contributing
something
new
and
exciting.
This
time,
I
was
ready
for
the
freezing
breeze
as
I
travelled
through
time.
The
breeze
propelled
us
into
2008;
the
fall
semester
of
my
freshman
year.
We
landed
on
the
second
floor
of
Watson
Hall,
Lafayette
College
and
I
peeked
into
the
room
252.
Sitting
at
her
desk
in
front
of
her
laptop
was
Freshman
Laura.
She
was
focused;
her
stare
would
not
waver
from
the
screen
and
sometimes
a
little
frown
would
crease
her
forehead
as
she
backspaced
and
then
inserted
a
better
substitute
for
her
word.
There
was
a
tower
of
books
stacked
up
on
the
corner
of
the
desk,
several
opened
books
in
the
keyboard
tray
and
Xeroxed
loose
pages
covering
the
surface,
it
looked
like
the
battlefield
of
an
author
hit
with
the
writing
frenzy.
A
closer
look
at
the
titles
of
the
books
-the
history
of
daylight-saving
time,
Seize
the
daylight,
Daylight
Saving
Change:
Energy
Boon
or
Waste
of
Time?
-
revealed
that
Freshman
Laura's
FYS
paper
was
in
progress.
I
had
decided
to
write
my
research
paper
about
Daylight
Saving
Time
to
illustrate
the
applications
of
the
textbook's
problem-solving
techniques
in
real
life.
Suddenly,
the
tension
evaporated
from
the
room
and
Freshman
burst
into
a
chuckled.
Intrigued
that
she
could
find
her
work
hilarious,
I
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
at
the
laptop's
screen...
"A
writer
is
someone
whose
skill
is
improved
by
a
deadline:
the
more
time
he
has,
the
worse
he
writes.
Karl
Kraus
-
Journalist,
Satirist"
The
facebook
webpage
was
open
and
the
chat
option
was
active.
She
was
chatting
with
her
high
school
friend
Sandra
and
she,
the
Queen
of
Procrastination,
was
ordering
her
to
sit
down
and
at
least
deliver
the
draft
v1.0.
by
tomorrow!
"To
tell
good
stories
with
information,
you
must
figure
out
what
you
have
learned
and
what
you
want
to
say!
And,
this
requires
thinking"
she
went
on.
Indeed,
Freshman
had
enjoyed
doing
research;
in
what
other
domain
could
you
possibly
go
anywhere,
see
anything,
read
anything,
talk
to
anyone,
and
still
claim
that
this
was
all
field-WORK!
However
the
volume
of
notes
and
data
collected
had
a
tendency
to
expand
exponentially
and
get
out
of
hand
and
that
was
exactly
the
case
for
Freshman
Laura.
The
information
was
cramming
every
space
of
her
room
and
disk
drive,
yet
only
a
few
sentences
were
compiled
into
the
research
paper.
The
daunting
task
of
writing
a
strong
data-driven
paper
on
a
single
topic
had
led
her
to
procrastinate
but
Sandra's
words
forced
her
to
face
the
truth;
the
end
would
not
get
closer
unless
she
get
started.
As
I
watched
Freshman
going
over
her
facts
sheets
again,
thinking
and
gathering
impressions,
I
understood
that
this
episode
of
my
life,
where
I
felt
overwhelmed
by
a
twenty
pages
paper,
made
me
into
a
more
organized
person.
As
a
researcher,
I
would
classify
and
analyze
bite
size
chunk
of
information
and
as
a
writer
I
would
set
multiple
deadlines
before
the
ultimate
one
to
prevent
the
last
minute
panic
and
cramming.
"Fearfulness,
contrary
to
all
other
vices,
makes
a
man
think
the
better
of
another,
the
worse
of
him.
Sir
Philip
Sidney
-
British
poet"
quoted
Eoin
Colfer
in
a
last
attempt
to
boost
my
confidence,
knowing
that
I
would
never
cave
in
under
fear
but
rise
to
the
challenge.
I
woke
up
with
a
gasp
and
bolted
upright.
I
was
at
my
desk
in
my
summer
housing,
with
highlighted
sections
of
the
WA
summer
reading
next
to
my
open
laptop.
Recovering
from
the
weirdest
and
most
vivid
dream,
I
paced
around
the
room.
Abruptly,
I
twisted
around,
dropped
in
my
chair
and
started
to
recount
my
ethereal
experience.
This
would
actually
make
a
good
essay
for
my
WA
assignment,
I
thought.
