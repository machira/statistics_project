Fall
WA
Writing
Assignment
08/16/04
Growing
With
Writing
I
believe
my
first
conscious
writing
experience
only
begun
in
earnest
once
I
had
a
vague
idea
of
how
to
read.
In
fact,
my
first
instruction
on
how
to
read
and
write
came
from
my
grandmother
who
has
never
spoken
a
complete
sentence
in
English
her
entire
life.
From
the
humble
lessons
of
my
grandmother
to
the
much
more
demanding
lessons
in
school,
my
writing
experiences
have
always
been
a
challenging
exposition
of
my
ability
as
writer.
Today,
I
regard
my
writing
style
as
one
that
has
been
influenced
through
the
practice
of
a
number
of
different
genres
that
I
have
been
exposed
to
over
the
years,
but
also
as
a
writing
style
that
is
still
evolving.
At
the
age
of
three,
using
little
cubes
of
drawing
paper
on
which
my
mother
had
printed
the
letters
of
the
alphabet,
my
grandmotherOs
first
exercise
would
be
to
coach
me
through
pronouncing
each
letter.
Next,
I
performed
the
more
excitable
task
of
printing
all
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
as
my
mother
had,
under
the
watchful
eye
of
my
grandmother.
However,
the
more
letter
cubes
I
printed,
the
more
pronunciation
exercises
I
had
to
endure.
Hence
before
I
attended
kindergarten
I
had
received
considerable
practice
in
letter
writing
and
begun
my
writing
history.
As
I
gradually
learnt
to
read
more
complex
words
and
books,
I
found
that
my
writing
skills
improved
whether
in
it
was
in
English
or
in
Kiswahili.
Under
the
education
system
in
Kenya,
English
and
Kiswahili
are
compulsory
subjects
for
all
students
up
until
the
completion
of
high
school.
Hence
both
language
syllabi
were
structured
in
similar
ways.
For
instance
when
we
covered
prepositions
in
English
we
would
do
the
same
topics
in
Kiswahili.
However,
given
that
English
is
the
major
language
of
instruction
in
most
schools
as
it
was
in
the
schools
that
I
attended,
my
writing
skills
in
Kiswahili
were
limited
due
to
the
lack
of
frequent
usage
of
the
language
in
the
classroom.
In
primary
(elementary)
school,
I
was
able
to
gauge
my
writing
ability
by
reviewing
my
results
on
compositions
(essays)
and
OinshaO,
which
is
the
Swahili
term
for
an
essay.
In
my
first
four
years
of
primary
school,
my
essays
were
very
limited
in
creativity
largely
due
to
the
fact
that
I
was
still
learning
competency
in
both
languages.
Every
week
we
would
have
one
hour
essay
lessons
in
both
languages
where
we
had
to
write
about
200
words
on
topics
such
as
NMy
best
friend,O
or
NMy
family,O
or
NThe
happiest
day
of
my
life,O
and
so
on.
However,
in
the
last
four
years
of
primary
school,
the
essay
topics
gradually
became
more
creative
and
indirect.
The
subsequent
change
in
writing
style
once
in
upper
primary
proved
to
be
one
of
my
most
demanding
transitions
in
writing
style
as
it
forced
me
to
be
creative
in
my
stories
rather
than
merely
stating
facts
in
the
right
language
tenses.
The
essay
titles
in
upper
primary
were
either
based
on
proverbs
or
NmethaliO
in
Kiswahili,
for
essay
titles
or
on
starting
or
completing
essays
with
a
given
sentence.
Both
exercises
would
also
demand
that
we
each
give
our
essays
our
own
unique
titles
and
giving
an
essay
a
good
title
still
remains
to
be
one
of
my
biggest
agonies
in
writing.
I
generally
preferred
the
second
option
of
either
starting
off
or
ending
with
a
given
sentence
because
it
gave
one
complete
freedom
and
creativity
as
to
what
a
story
would
cover.
This
idea
of
freely
owning
a
story
gave
me
great
encouragement
to
be
creative
with
my
writing
and
I
often
obtained
perfect
or
near
perfect
scores
in
these
exercises.
However,
with
the
former
writing
option,
my
biggest
fear
was
always
that
I
might
not
understand
the
true
meaning
of
the
proverb
or
NmethaliO.
The
above
circumstance
would
usually
lead
to
hastily
concluded
essays
where
the
proverb
is
thrown
in
at
the
conclusion
in
an
attempt
to
piece
together
all
the
pieces
of
the
story.
One
usually
obtained
lower
scores
if
oneOs
conclusion
failed
to
explain
the
meaning
of
the
proverb
or
OmethaliO
fairly
well.
However,
despite
the
limited
scope
of
creativity
that
the
proverb
or
NmethaliO
essay
imposed
on
my
writing,
I
also
feel
that
I
was
in
a
way
trained
to
learn
how
to
write
by
capturing
the
meaning
of
a
saying
into
our
daily
lives.
Unfortunately,
during
my
first
two
years
of
high
school,
I
was
painfully
aware
that
my
creative
writing
skills
were
severely
ignored
due
to
the
school
curriculum.
The
syllabi
of
both
English
and
Kiswahili
placed
a
great
emphasis
on
gaining
grammatical
competency
in
each
language.
Today,
I
feel
that
this
form
of
teaching
was
misguided
due
to
the
fact
that
we
rarely
wrote
any
creative
pieces
of
writing.
Instead
we
focused
on
answering
questions
related
to
given
comprehensions
and
filling
in
the
blanks
with
the
correct
grammatical
tenses
or
punctuations.
However,
in
the
final
two
years
of
high
school
under
the
Kenyan
system,
language
instruction
involves
reading
and
writing
about
literature
but
circumstances
did
not
permit
me
to
go
through
this
second
phase
of
instruction.
During
my
third
year
of
high
school,
I
transferred
to
the
Braeside
High
School
in
Nairobi
where
my
mother
was
the
head
of
the
English
department.
Braeside
is
a
private
school,
which
follows
the
International
British
Curriculum,
which
is
taught
in
many
parts
of
the
world
where
the
British
have
had
considerable
colonial
influence.
The
advantage
of
receiving
this
kind
of
international
education
certificate
is
that
one
can
gain
entry
into
many
universities
around
the
world
easily
because
they
hold
a
certificate
that
is
recognized
internationally.
In
my
case,
it
was
at
Braeside
that
I
began
to
learn
how
to
write
keeping
in
mind
that
I
was
writing
for
an
international
audience.
At
Braeside,
my
cravings
for
creative
writing
were
satisfied,
as
it
was
mandatory
for
each
student
to
write
a
creative
and
a
factual
term
paper
on
any
topic.
These
assignments
were
referred
to
as
OcourseworkO
because
students
worked
on
them
over
the
period
of
the
first
semester
of
oneOs
final
year.
Furthermore,
the
grades
from
our
coursework
counted
as
part
of
oneOs
final
English
grade
because
they
counted
for
forty
percent
of
oneOs
final
grade
without
the
written
exam.
The
assignments
proved
to
be
interesting
in
that
we
could
write
on
any
topic
and
this
challenged
me
because
I
had
just
spent
two
years
writing
only
what
I
was
directed
to
write.
However,
another
expected
challenge
was
becoming
accustomed
to
having
my
mother
as
my
teacher
and
my
greatest
critic.
My
mother
later
told
me
that
she
was
particularly
strict
when
grading
my
papers
because
she
feared
that
if
she
was
lenient
with
me,
in
the
end
when
my
papers
would
be
graded
in
England
by
foreigners
I
would
receive
lower
grades.
Hence
in
order
to
avoid
being
accused
of
favoritism
she
made
sure
that
I
always
answered
the
questions
and
used
the
correct
writing
styles
as
directed.
For
my
final
piece
of
creative
writing
I
wrote
a
sequel
to
the
final
scene
to
the
classic
play
by
Nikolai
Golgol,
NThe
Government
InspectorO.
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
writing
this
piece
as
it
offered
an
alternative
conclusion
and
continuation
to
the
play
but
still
retained
the
original
plot
and
pace
of
the
play.
However,
when
it
came
to
the
factual
piece,
I
once
again
felt
slightly
constrained
because
whatever
we
choose
to
write
had
to
be
proven
by
facts
and
I
think
I
eventually
wrote
a
paper
about
the
planets.
Despite
the
fact
that
coursework
was
a
generally
frustrating
process
of
writing
and
rewriting
about
six
pages
with
very
strict
guidelines,
I
feel
that
this
was
one
of
the
major
turning
points
in
my
writing
history.
Through
coursework
I
learnt
how
to
soundly
present
either
creative
or
factual
writing
in
a
style
that
would
allow
any
audience
to
appreciate
the
extensive
nature
of
any
topic.
In
addition
the
written
exam
component
of
our
final
English
exam
also
offered
me
an
opportunity
to
practice
writing
in
different
genres.
In
the
first
part
of
the
exam
we
were
guaranteed
to
answer
questions
on
given
comprehension
passage.
However,
the
second
part
of
the
exam
was
always
more
nerve
racking
because
the
question
would
randomly
direct
one
to
use
a
specific
kind
of
genre
for
a
particular
audience.
Hence
we
could
be
asked
to
write
official
letters,
love
letters,
complaints
to
an
editor,
slogans
for
an
advertising
campaign
or
the
first
ten
pages
of
a
childrenOs
reading
book
or
a
recipe
book
or
to
summarize
newspaper
articles
D
the
choices
seemed
to
be
endless.
While
I
enjoyed
the
learning
experience
of
writing
in
different
genres
the
anxiety
and
anticipation
endured
while
waiting
to
find
out
what
the
exam
questions
would
be
was
simply
unbearable.
However,
the
exams
tested
our
ability
to
understand
what
kind
of
audience
we
would
be
writing
for
and
how
to
fulfill
the
needs
of
the
question
at
hand.
Regardless
of
the
given
genre,
I
was
pleased
with
the
fact
that
I
could
come
up
with
a
satisfactory
piece
of
writing
in
under
pressure
and
writing
a
given
time
constraint.
After
high
school,
I
proceeded
to
take
courses
in
the
British
Advanced
Level
high
school
system.
A-levels
as
they
are
called,
are
a
two
year
program
that
are
the
British
equivalent
to
pre-university
courses
and
a
student
usually
picks
three
of
four
subjects
to
study
that
are
directed
to
oneOs
expected
course
of
study
in
university.
In
my
case
I
chose
to
pursue
English
literature,
economics
and
mathematics.
Economics
proved
to
be
my
most
difficult
subject
because
aside
from
stating
learnt
facts
and
definitions,
it
challenged
one
to
think
and
write
responses
in
a
logical
way
that
was
consistent
with
the
theories
as
taught
in
class.
While
I
failed
to
capture
the
precise
and
cogent
writing
skill
that
was
demanded
in
Economics,
I
was
at
least
able
to
excel
in
the
more
broad
interpretations
of
English
literature.
We
studied
three
novels
and
one
collection
of
poems
each
year
and
the
choice
of
the
texts
either
fell
within
the
nineteenth
or
in
the
twentieth
century
category.
The
texts
we
covered
included
Macbeth
and
Othello
by
William
Shakespeare,
The
Duchess
of
Malfi
by
John
Webster,
A
Streetcar
Named
Desire
by
Tennessee
Williams,
Things
Fall
Apart
by
Chinua
Achebe,
Sense
and
Sensibility
by
Jane
Austen,
and
collection
of
poems
in
the
novel
Touched
with
Fire
by
Jack
Hydes
and
a
collection
of
poems
by
T.S.
Eliot.
With
the
above
broad
range
of
writing
genres
our
main
task
was
to
critically
analyze
the
characters
and
issues
discussed
in
the
texts
with
the
aim
of
justifying
each
characterOs
role.
Our
exams
focused
on
writing
approximately
four
essay
questions
in
two
hours.
While
the
questions
usually
focused
on
a
particular
quality
of
a
character
or
of
the
author
or
poet,
we
were
urged
to
incorporate
our
knowledge
of
the
entire
novel,
play
or
poem
in
our
responses.
I
received
great
insights
about
the
complexities
of
life
through
reading
our
assigned
texts
but
even
more
satisfactory
was
the
skill
to
extensively
explain
the
complexities
of
the
characters
or
authors
lives
on
paper.
After
completing
my
A-level
studies
I
felt
that
I
was
adequately
prepared
for
college
writing
as
I
had
learnt
how
to
critically
analyze
an
issue
and
state
my
personal
feelings
about
the
issue
at
hand.
However,
I
must
admit
that
I
did
have
some
trouble
writing
essays
for
college
because
the
entire
focus
shifted
from
general
understanding
of
an
issue
to
my
personal
feelings
only.
Hence,
although
I
felt
prepared
to
write
at
great
length
about
specific
issues
as
raised
in
exam
questions,
when
it
came
to
writing
about
Ome,O
I
was
slightly
stumped.
With
some
practice,
I
was
finally
able
to
produce
about
four
essays
that
I
used
alternately
for
the
Common
Application
to
colleges
in
the
US.
My
First
Year
Seminar,
NThe
Art
of
Letter
Writing,O
was
a
brilliant
eye
opener
into
the
amazing
skills
that
some
authors
use
by
conveying
their
messages
through
letters.
We
practiced
writing
a
wide
range
of
letters
from
official
letters
to
love
letters
to
job
application
letters
and
so
on.
However,
my
favorite
part
of
the
class
was
the
texts
we
studied
which
included
Dangerous
Liaisons
by
Choderlos
de
Laclos
and
So
Long
a
Letter
by
Mariama
Ba.
These
novels
are
formed
entirely
thorough
the
letter
correspondence
of
the
characters
and
to
me
that
was
a
very
interesting
but
unexplored
genre
of
writing.
Currently,
I
have
taken
very
few
writing
courses
at
Lafayette.
Initially,
quite
a
few
professors
commented
that
my
writing
style
was
difficult
to
follow
but
my
aim
has
been
to
gradually
make
my
writing
more
direct
so
as
to
meet
college
expectations
and
standards.
Similarly,
I
feel
that
with
every
writing
course
I
take
or
term
paper
that
I
write,
I
improve
my
writing
skills
by
becoming
more
cogent,
precise
and
thoughtful.
My
hopes
are
high
that
by
the
time
I
complete
college
I
will
be
a
proficient
writer
in
a
number
of
genres
so
that
my
writing
can
be
understood
clearly
by
different
audiences.
