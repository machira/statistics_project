Literary
Narrative
Writing--as
both
an
education
al
task
and
a
creative
pastime--has
always
been
a
noteworthy
part
of
my
life.
Even
before
I
could
read
and
successfully
write
down
all
of
my
own
thoughts,
I
have
memories
of
attempting
to
write.
I
guess
the
first
substantial
attempt
came
when
I
was
about
four
years
old.
I
remember
looking
out
the
window
on
a
gorgeous
spring
day
and
explaining
to
my
mother
that
it
was
snowing
outside.
This
"snow"
was
in
fact
the
cherry
blossoms
from
the
tree
in
my
backyard
blowing
gently
in
the
wind.
My
mother
must
have
been
intrigued
by
my
observation
because
she
encouraged
me
to
write
a
story
about
what
I
saw
outside.
She
recorded
my
elementary
attempts
at
plot
and
sentence
structure
and
she
wrote
it
all
in
a
little
booklet
that
I
later
illustrated
and
bound
with
cardboard
and
some
leftover
pieces
of
our
kitchen
wallpaper.
I
still
have
the
little
book
today,
along
with
others
produced
in
a
similar
fashion,
and
although
they
are
far
from
anything
deserving
of
literary
criticism,
I
guess
you
could
say
that
even
at
the
tender
age
of
four
I
was
proud
to
see
the
fruits
of
my
labor.
Since
then
I
have
been
exposed
to
a
multitude
of
different
writing
styles
and
techniques.
Throughout
elementary
school,
I
learned
to
master
some
of
these
and
adopt
them
as
part
of
my
own
writing
process.
However,
being
forced
to
stay
within
the
boundaries
of
a
certain
teacher's
writing
method
often
frustrated
me.
I
felt
like
the
minute
I
finally
understood
exactly
what
the
teacher
wanted,
the
year
would
be
over
and
I
would
have
to
get
used
to
a
whole
new
system
with
a
new
teacher.
I
can
remember
specifically
the
transition
from
third
to
fourth
grade.
In
third
grade
we
had
learned
what
I
thought
to
be
the
ultimate
method
of
writing
book
reports.
There
were
specific
questions
detailed
on
a
worksheet
to
answer
and
a
definitive
style
in
which
to
answer
them.
By
the
end
of
the
year
I
felt
that
I
understood
everything
and
I
was
ready
to
start
fourth
grade
being
able
to
write
book
reports
perfectly.
However,
when
the
first
fourth
grade
assignment
arrived,
I
was
alarmed
to
learn
that
we
would
not
be
allowed
to
follow
the
same
format
from
the
previous
year.
I
timidly
confronted
my
teacher
about
my
desire
to
use
the
third
grade
book
report
worksheet,
and
she
replied--rather
vehemently--that
I
would
never
learn
and
grow
as
a
writer
if
I
refused
to
try
new
writing
styles.
Although
I
returned
grumpily
to
my
seat
that
day,
I
know
now
that
her
theory
is
correct.
In
the
end,
she
turned
out
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
teachers
because
she
always
encouraged
my
classmates
and
me
to
express
ourselves.
For
example,
I
had
a
journal
topic
to
write
about
each
day
upon
entering
the
classroom.
Questions
ranged
from
telling
about
my
weekend
to
reacting
to
poetry.
I
guess
it
was
in
fourth
grade,
then,
that
I
first
took
up
freestyle
writing
on
my
own
time.
I
have
kept
a
journal
almost
continuously
since
then
(except
for
those
few
years
when
I
was
too
scared
that
my
sister
would
find
it
and
embarrass
me
with
all
my
secrets.)
Journal
writing
for
me
was
always
a
way
to
escape
from
the
strict
forms
that
my
teachers
often
imposed
on
me.
I
was
never
a
rebellious
student,
but
I
found
it
comforting
to
write
on
my
own
without
worrying
about
grammar
and
structure
and
all
the
details
that
teachers
must
teach
in
order
to
produce
students
who
understand
how
to
write
well.
Meanwhile,
I
eagerly
tackled
all
of
the
various
writing
assignments
presented
to
me
in
middle
school
with
much
vigor.
Middle
school
stressed
writing
as
a
creative
process.
With
the
help
of
the
new
computer
lab,
my
teachers
expected
me
to
produce
more
than
one
draft
of
an
assignment
to
illustrate
the
progression
of
my
work.
Before
using
the
computers
to
complete
my
work,
I
had
to
"brainstorm"
on
paper
the
basic
structure
of
the
assignment.
I
learned
several
styles
for
brainstorming,
including
a
branching
strategy
that
centered
around
a
topic
sentence
or
a
few
main
characters
or
ideas
and
a
free-writing
style
in
which
I
would
just
record
my
thoughts
for
a
main
idea
on
paper
as
they
came
to
me.
As
the
computer
became
less
of
a
luxury
and
more
of
a
standard
tool,
I
can
remember
getting
annoyed
when
teachers
would
still
require
the
rough
draft
to
be
handwritten.
However,
I
admit
that
even
now
I
often
start
my
first
stages
of
writing
on
paper
because
it
gives
me
a
more
natural
ability
to
let
my
random
thoughts
escape
onto
the
paper
through
a
pen
instead
of
through
a
keyboard.
This
process
of
brainstorming
was
especially
helpful
to
me
in
seventh
grade
when
my
English
teacher
encouraged
us
to
produce
original
poetry.
Writing
poetry
had
always
felt
like
I
was
crashing
into
a
brick
wall;
I
was
hesitant
to
read
and
try
to
understand
it
and
even
more
hesitant
to
write
it
myself
because
I
thought
that
I
lacked
the
creative
capability
to
write
anything
worth
reading.
It
was
daunting
to
me
because
writing
poetry
differed
so
much
from
writing
prose.
I
recall
one
day
when
my
teacher
put
Paul
Simon's
"The
Sound
of
Silence"
on
and
asked
my
class
to
record
the
emotional
response
that
we
had
from
listening
to
the
music.
Once
I
got
used
to
writing
with
music
in
the
background
I
found
it
comforting
and
encouraging
to
hear
beautifully
constructed
words
while
I
myself
was
trying
to
compose
poetry.
I
wouldn't
say
that
this
strategy
cured
me
of
my
fear
of
poetry,
but
it
did
help
me
to
feel
a
little
more
comfortable
with
forms
of
writing
other
than
basic
prose.
By
the
end
of
middle
school
I
was
ready
for
more
challenging
assignments.
At
the
end
of
eighth
grade
I
had
my
first
major
research
paper
assignment.
I
had
to
use
note
cards
and
produce
a
limited
bibliography
and
then
write
a
five-page
paper
on
the
topic
of
my
choice.
Now
I
can
spit
out
a
legible
five-pager
in
matter
of
hours,
but
to
the
precarious
eighth-grader,
writing
five
pages
was
quite
an
arduous
and
seemingly
impossible
task.
I
simply
could
not
imagine
having
enough
to
say
about
one
topic.
However,
after
researching
extensively
my
topic--The
Interpretation
of
Dreams--I
had
my
first
of
many
experiences
with
the
problem
of
having
too
much
to
say.
It
was
this
paper
that
first
taught
me
the
value
of
revision.
Peer
and
individual
revision
had
always
been
a
part
of
the
writing
process
throughout
middle
school.
We
often
got
into
groups
to
discuss
our
writing,
and
we
had
to
revise
assignments
after
the
teacher
had
read
and
commented
on
them.
My
eighth
grade
term
paper,
however,
forced
me
to
revise
seriously
on
my
own
for
the
first
time.
I
had
to
make
my
paper
the
proper
page
limit
and
make
sure
that
what
I
was
writing
made
sense
with
the
research
that
I
had
done.
Needless
to
say,
I
was
thankful
that
we
had
a
computer
in
my
house
by
that
time!
Another
form
of
writing
that
emerged
as
an
important
part
of
my
educational
career
was
writing
in
the
"scientific
method."
Even
in
elementary
school
I
had
designed
projects
for
the
science
fair
centered
around
basic
ideas
like
observation,
hypothesis,
and
conclusion.
In
middle
school
I
had
to
elaborate
on
these
ideas
and
do
basic
lab
write-ups
that
followed
a
specific
format.
The
format
was
uniform
throughout
all
of
middle
school
so
that
students
got
used
to
writing
about
science
in
the
same
way,
a
strategy
that
illustrated
to
me
how
rigid
scientific
writing
must
be
in
order
to
abide
by
the
rules
of
writing
in
the
regular
scientific
community.
I
had
difficulty
conforming
to
this
system
at
first
because
the
words
and
sentence
structure
that
I
could
use
were
so
limited.
It
was
not
until
high
school
that
I
really
came
to
understand
why
scientific
writing
had
to
be
so
strict
and
exact.
By
then
I
was
expected
to
produce
more
extensive
lab
reports,
concentrating
on
answering
questions
based
on
observations
and
then
effectively
making
conclusions
about
these
observations.
Along
with
refining
my
ability
to
write
according
to
the
scientific
method,
my
writing
assignments
in
high
school
helped
to
develop
more
mature
writing
skills.
The
most
prevalent
writing
form
throughout
high
school
was
the
infamous
5-paragraph
essay.
This
form
dominated
my
English
assignments
for
three
years.
Just
like
my
paper
on
dream
interpretation,
the
papers
I
wrote
using
the
5-paragraph
format
caused
me
much
grief
because
I
had
to
condense
my
writing
into
an
introduction,
three
distinct
paragraphs,
and
a
strong
conclusion.
In
my
opinion,
this
format
left
little
room
for
me
to
use
my
imagination
and
to
showcase
my
ability
as
a
writer.
I
became
more
worried
about
the
length
of
my
paragraphs
than
the
content.
As
much
as
I
grew
to
loathe
this
composition
style,
however,
I
see
its
value
now.
It
did
limit
my
creativity,
but
it
forced
me
to
read
and
revise
my
work
well
enough
that
it
fit
into
the
confines
of
the
assignment.
Plus,
it
stressed
the
importance
of
a
coherent
introduction
and
a
strong
conclusion,
elements
that
I
could
then
carry
with
me
to
less
conforming
writing
styles.
Ultimately
this
ubiquitous
writing
form
was
abandoned
my
senior
year
in
A.P
English.
That
year--thanks
to
the
most
influential
teacher
of
my
entire
education
thus
far--was
by
far
the
most
significant
in
developing
my
writing.
His
expectations
were
high
and
his
grading
system
ruthless,
but
there
was
not
a
day
the
whole
year
that
I
didn't
look
forward
to
attending
his
class.
My
enthusiasm
originated
in
my
desire
to
write
according
to
his
standards.
I
would
revise
to
the
point
that
I
thought
there
were
no
conceivable
grammar
mistakes,
only
to
get
back
a
paper
that
one
would
have
guessed
had
been
to
World
War
II
and
back.
My
friends
and
I
even
got
together
for
"revision
parties,"
hoping
that
our
collective
brains
would
be
enough
to
combat
his
virulent
red
pen.
In
truth,
no
one
could
ever
earn
a
perfect
grade
on
a
composition;
even
low
"As"
were
hard
to
come
by.
But
he
taught
me
that
no
matter
how
hard
you
work
to
revise
a
paper,
you
are
never
truly
finished.
You
can
always
go
back
and
make
adjustments,
or
consider
comments
from
educated
readers
of
your
work.
Although
my
grades
were
significantly
lower
in
that
class
than
they
ever
had
been
in
English,
I
enjoyed
the
challenge.
I
liked
knowing
that
I
had
put
all
of
my
energy
into
one
concentrated
task,
because
the
extra
effort
made
me
feel
proud
of
the
finished
product
that
I
had
created.
Plus,
my
teacher's
praise
meant
so
much
more
knowing
that
he
only
complemented
work
that
truly
deserved
to
be
complemented.
I
carried
these
skills
of
revision
and
dedication
with
me
to
college.
So
far
I
have
had
a
similar
experience
as
I
did
in
my
A.P
English
class.
The
writing
that
is
most
meaningful
to
me
is
the
writing
to
which
I
dedicate
extensive
revision
time.
I
feed
off
of
the
comments
of
my
professors,
especially
when
the
comments
encourage
me
to
work
harder
or
offer
alternative
ways
of
interpreting
what
I
have
written.
Although
A.P
English
gave
me
a
preview
of
what
to
expect
in
college,
my
most
significant
area
of
adjustment
was
changing
the
focus
of
my
writing
efforts
from
style
to
content.
In
high
school
I
was
mostly
concerned
with
fitting
a
system
and
doing
what
I
had
to
do
to
get
a
good
grade.
Now
that
I
know
how
to
write
in
several
different
styles,
I
have
to
concentrate
more
on
saying
something
meaningful
instead
of
saying
something
the
right
way
to
make
it
work
with
the
style
of
writing
that
the
teacher
wants.
My
biggest
difficulty
thus
far
in
college
came
last
year
when
I
took
an
introductory
philosophy
course.
For
the
first
time
I
stepped
away
from
rules
of
grammar
and
proper
form
completely
so
that
I
could
embrace
my
true
emotions.
I
had
to
make
conclusions
and
support
these
conclusions
about
my
beliefs
and
ethical
values
in
writing
before
I
even
understood
these
beliefs
in
my
own
mind.
It
was
persuasive
writing
at
its
most
core
form
because
I
had
to
persuade
myself
at
the
same
time
that
I
was
persuading
my
potential
audience.
That
philosophy
class
helped
me
to
mature
as
both
a
thinker
and
a
writer,
and
it
served
as
a
model
for
how
I
want
my
writing
to
improve
in
the
future.
The
issues
that
I
struggled
with
in
my
writing
for
that
class
are
those
that
I
think
I
will
spend
the
next
two
trying
to
work
out.
Now
that
I
know
how
to
write
well,
I
have
to
turn
my
efforts
to
finding
creative
and
fulfilling
ideas
to
incorporate
into
my
writing.
Looking
back
on
all
that
I
have
learned
throughout
my
writing
career,
I
have
come
to
understand
the
value
of
concentrated
revision
and
working
through
a
challenging
assignment.
Although
I
look
back
on
some
of
my
writing
assignments
throughout
my
life
as
repetitive
and
overly
structured
tasks,
I
appreciate
them
for
what
they
were
worth.
In
the
words
of
E.
B.
White,
one
must
understand
the
rules
before
breaking
them.
For
me,
my
whole
history
of
learning
to
write
has
been
grasping
the
concepts
of
different
writing
forms
under
the
supervision
of
my
teachers
so
that
I
can
later
go
off
and
integrate
these
different
forms
with
my
own
personal
style.
That
way,
I
can
produce
the
style
of
writing
that
is
most
appropriate
in
any
given
circumstance.
The
most
interesting
and
rewarding
characteristic
of
my
writing
process
is
that
it
will
never
stop
changing.
I
will
continue
to
learn
more
and
integrate
new
ideas
and
experiences
into
my
writing
style.
