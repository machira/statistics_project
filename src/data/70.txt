LITERACY
NARRATIVE
Project
for
Workshop
August
22,
1996
With
a
pencil,
my
small,
clumsy
hand
scrawled
words
across
the
paper.
My
head
was
cocked
toward
my
right
shoulder
and
my
brown
pigtails
swayed
and
hit
the
table
top.
A
look
of
concentration
was
etched
on
my
face
as
my
tongue
pressed
hard
against
my
bottom
lip.
Earlier
that
day,
my
first
tooth
fell
out
while
I
was
moving
it
back-and-forth
with
my
tongue.
When
I
showed
my
mother
my
tooth,
she
revealed
that
little
girls
and
boys
receive
a
present
from
the
tooth
fairy
when
they
put
their
tooth
underneath
their
pillow
at
night.
I
was
writing
this
letter
to
the
tooth
fairy,to
make
sure
that
she
would
give
me
something
in
return
for
my
tooth.
Smiling,
I
finished
my
written
masterpiece
that
read,
"Here
is
my
tooth
now
give
me
my
money."
Some
of
the
words
were
spelled
incorrectly
and
an
occasional
letter
was
written
backwards.
When
my
mother
saw
the
note,
she
smiled,
patted
my
small
back,
and
said
words
of
reassurance.
When
it
grew
dark,
I
put
that
piece
of
paper
and
my
tooth
under
my
soft
pillow
and
fell
asleep.
My
first
attempts
at
writing
were
clumsy
and
messy.
At
one
time,
I
wondered
why
my
mother
never
corrected
the
errors
I
wrote
in
that
note
to
the
tooth
fairy.
Now,
I
realize
that
she
did
not
modify
the
defects
in
my
best
interest.
One
way
for
my
writing
skills
to
grow,
at
that
young
age,
was
to
boost
my
self
confidence
whenever
I
wrote.
My
mother
did
that
by
encouraging
me
that
what
I
created
was
wonderful.
Simply
encouraging
me
to
write
was
the
first
step
in
allowing
my
writing
skills
to
grow
and
to
be
explored.
It
was
by
growing,
with
age
and
education,
that
I
would
realize
mistakes
and
my
capability
to
write.
Writing,
in
large
lengths,
was
never
an
issue
in
elementary
school.
It
was
in
middle
school
where
I
was
formally
introduced
to
the
research
paper.
On
the
first
day
of
sixth
grade
English,
my
teacher
gave
a
writing
assignment
of
a
three
page
paper
about
a
famous
author
using
five
sources.
Mrs.
Dorghety
explained
that
our
class
would
go
to
the
library
and
research
the
author
we
chose.
I
was
very
scared
because
I
had
never
used
the
library
as
a
place
to
do
research
and
I
had
never
written
anything
that
long
in
elementary
school.
Before
now,
the
library
was
the
place
to
have
stories
read
to
me
and
where
I
could
check
out
story
books.
I
was
very
intimidated
at
the
idea
of
using
books
to
write
a
paper.
The
next
day,
my
class
was
introduced
to
Mrs.
Taylor,
the
librarian.
For
that
whole
period,
my
English
class
discovered
how
the
library
was
used
to
investigate
the
author
we
would
write
about.
I
watched
as
the
white-haired
librarian
bounced
from
room
to
room
teaching
us
how
to
find
books
using
the
card
catalogs,
by
subject,
title
and
author,
and
how
to
use
the
overhead
projectors
and
videos.
My
tension
was
released
when
she
concluded
because
she
made
the
library
seem
to
be
more
of
a
helping
factor
than
a
threat.
My
pulse
rose
when,
the
next
day,
I
was
acquainted
with
bibliographies
and
footnotes.
I
did
not
realize
that
research
papers
would
take
that
much
work.
Where
do
I
put
the
periods
and
the
commas?
Was
that
underlined
or
in
quotation
marks?
The
whole
idea
was
frightening.
I
was
confused
and
I
began
to
hate
the
idea
of
writing.
I
knew,
though,
that
I
had
to
succeed
in
the
English
class
or
I
would
never
pass
the
sixth
grade.
Mrs.
Dorghety's
English
class
was
the
stepping
stone
in
my
formal
writing
experience.
From
this
class
on,
I
was
required
and
expected
to
understand
how
to
write
research
papers
of
substantial
lengths.
Elementary
school
had
prepared
me
for
the
nature
of
writing
that
was
proposed
to
me
in
middle
school.
The
fundamental
drills
in
grammar
and
spelling
helped
me
tackle
the
challenge
of
writing
lengthy
papers.
When
I
entered
Mrs.
Cooper's
English
class,
in
the
seventh
grade,
I
began
writing
a
daily
journal.
Mrs.
Cooper
allotted
fifteen
minutes
at
the
beginning
of
every
class
for
me
to
comment
on
the
topic
that
was
written
on
the
blackboard.
The
topics
that
I
wrote
about
varied
from
reflecting
on
the
reading
I
completed
the
night
before
to
writing
about
current
issues
in
the
news.
She
explained
that
daily
spontaneous
writing
would
strengthen
my
ideas
and
writing
skills.
Writing
in
a
journal
every
day
allowed
me
to
expand
my
thoughts
and
to
become
more
creative.
It
also
helped
me
build
a
stronger
vocabulary
and
to
reflect
on
issues
that
were
happening
around
me.
I
began
to
see
that
there
were
other
methods
of
writing
other
than
the
writing
in
research
papers.
Writing
was
becoming
less
of
a
chore
because
I
was
doing
it
routinely.
My
creativity
was
allowed
to
emerge
when
I
was
challenged
to
write
an
"imaginative"
essay
for
my
English
class
in
eighth
grade.
Dr.
Lane
wanted
me
to
be
as
creative
as
possible
when
I
wrote
my
essay.
I
could
not
comprehend
that
she
wanted
me
to
make
writing
playful.
Until
then,
writing
had
been
so
bland
and
stodgy,
but
that
unsuspected
assignment
stirred
up
my
"creative
juices".
I
wrote
about
a
"wild
thing"
that
had
ten
arms,
three
eyes,
and
a
purple
body
with
red
spiked
hair
all
over
it.
This
intriguing
and
exciting
essay
made
me
realize
that
there
was
much
more
to
writing
than
"copying"
out
of
an
encyclopedia
for
a
research
paper.
Writing
this
imaginative
essay
was
the
first
time
that
any
teacher
required
me
to
write
about
anything
I
invented.
In
the
past,
I
was
obligated
to
write
about
themes
that
were
previously
written
about.
I
recall
being
troubled
by
this
unique
outlook
on
writing
because
it
was
unexplored
to
me.
I
did
overcome
my
complications,
though,
and
I
enjoyed
writing
and
examining
my
vast
ideas.
Previously,
I
believed
that
the
bulk
of
my
writing
would
be
exclusively
in
English
classes.
I
was
wrong
because
writing,
coupled
with
research,
played
a
sizable
part
in
Science.
In
my
eighth
grade
Earth
Science
class
I
was
exposed
to
a
high
level
of
research.
When
I
picked
thermal
pollution
for
my
topic
in
the
science
fair,
my
teacher
demanded
that
I
write
letters
to
business
companies,
that
dealt
with
thermal
pollution,
for
information.
On
top
of
that,
he
also
made
it
mandatory
that
I
use
the
library
as
a
resource
for
my
paper.
I
wrote
countless
drafts
that
were
checked
by
my
teacher,
until
the
final
product
was
shown
at
the
fair.
When
1
reflect
back
on
my
experience
with
Mr.
Rylko,
I
realize
that
he
pushed
me
to
excel
in
writing.
He
stressed
multi-draft
papers
and
would
even
check
them
so
he
was
sure
that
each
draft
was
improving.
His
class
prepared
me
for
the
next
step
of
writing
in
high
school.
When
I
was
a
freshman
in
high
school,
I
had
the
luxury
to
have
Mrs.
Cooper
teach
my
English
class
a
second
time.
In
her
class,
I
wrote
a
daily
journal
that
Mrs.
Cooper
took
to
another
level.
As
a
ninth-grader
I
was
getting
more
involved
in
reading
lengthier
books.
That
year,
Mrs.
Cooper
assigned
me
to
read
I
Know
Why
the
Caged
Bird
Sings,
Catcher
In
the
Rye,
and
A
Separate
Peace.
She
also
included,
in
the
assignment,
a
journal
that
I
would
have
to
write
while
reading
the
books.
In
the
journal,
she
wanted
me
to
spontaneously
write
about
anything
that
came
to
my
mind
while
I
read.
At
the
conclusion
of
each
book,
she
collected
the
journal
and
commented
on
what
I
had
written.
She
added
some
ideas
that
I
did
not
ponder
and
supported
ideas
that
she
agreed
with.
The
journals
from
Mrs.
Cooper's
English
class
attributed
to
the
depth
of
my
writing.
As
in
seventh
grade,
my
ideas
became
more
spontaneous
and
my
vocabulary
grew.
I
did
not
use
writing
solely
for
school
work.
Writing
became
a
tool
for
my
everyday
use
to
explore
myself.
The
journal
did
not
feel
like
work
because
I
was
allowed
to
express
my
own
ideas
without
someone
continuously
correcting
what
I
said.
In
later
years,
my
writing
became
more
confident
and
self
assured
because
Mrs.
Cooper
did
not
focus
on
negatively
criticizing
my
ideas.
Her
opinion
about
my
thoughts
and
my
writing
techniques
were
very
favorable.
From
the
ninth
grade
to
the
twelfth
grade,
my
writing
was
focused
around
books
that
I
read.
I
answered
questions
and
wrote
papers
about
the
central
meaning"
of
a
certain
text
or
reasons
why
particular
characters
acted
in
certain
ways.
For
every
book
I
argued
the
same
issues
and
themes.
I
was
never
allowed
to
write
about
any
topic
that
I
chose.
There
always
seemed
to
be
guidelines
that
restricted
what
I
wished
to
say.
Writing
became
monotonous
and
dull
and
I
grew
uninterested
in
it.
The
greatest
advancement
in
my
writing
occurred
when
I
was
a
senior
in
high
school.
The
ideas
shared
in
Mrs.
McLaughlin's
English
class
allowed
me
to
write
like
I
had
never
written
before.
She
was
exciting
and
I
could
never
predict
what
her
assignment
would
consist
of.
Some
of
her
writing
techniques
brought
out
the
most
polished
papers
that
I
have
ever
written.
My
most
creative
and
personal
works
were
a
result
of
her
class.
In
the
beginning
of
the
year,
Mrs.
McLaughlin
assigned
The
Canterbury
Tales
to
read.
At
the
end
of
a
four
week
time
period,
in
which
the
class
read
the
book
and
tore
apart
every
little
detail
it
contained,
Mrs.
McLaughlin
revealed
a
very
challenging
project.
She
required
each
student
to
write
his
own
"Canterbury
Tale".
I
was
obligated
to
write
a
tale
about
twenty
one
individual
pilgrims,
all
going
to
the
same
destination,
in
the
iambic
pentameter.
Her
assignment
seemed
to
be
a
phenomenal
task
that
would
necessitate
months
to
accomplish.
I
eventually
did
complete
it
while
enjoying
myself
and
realizing
the
exciting
things
that
writing
could
offer.
The
Canterbury
Tales
assignment
brought
out
the
most
creative
side
of
me.
While
having
to
develop
twenty
one
different
characters,
I
had
to
write
a
sensible
tale
with
rhyming
ending
lines.
There
were
no
limitations
on
the
types
of
characters
that
I
wanted
to
travel
on
the
pilgrimage
that
I
chose.
This
assignment
was
tremendous
because
I
was
allowed
to
enjoy
what
I
was
writing
about
by
permitting
my
imagination
to
run
wild.
One
writing
technique
that
I
was
introduced
to,
in
Mrs.
McLaughlin's
class,
was
peer
evaluations.
In
the
beginning,
I
was
a
bit
timid
to
let
other
people
read
what
I
wrote
because
I
did
not
know
how
people
would
react.
I
soon
realized
the
power
of
this
tool
because
the
evaluations
allowed
me
to
spot
what
other
people
liked
in
my
writing,
while
I
encountered
parts
in
my
writing
that
could
be
improved.
It
was
useful
to
have
an
outsider
read
my
papers
because
I
got
a
point
of
view
that
I
could
not
give
myself.
Classmates
pointed
out
mistakes
that
I
did
not
see
because
I
labored
over
the
paper
for
too
much
time.
I
found
my
forte
in
writing
when
I
wrote
a
personal
essay
for
Mrs.
McLaughlin's
class.
One
required
paper,
for
the
year,
was
to
write
about
a
personal
experience
using
peer
evaluations
and
multiple
drafts.
This
was
the
first
time
that
I
was
truly
able
to
explore
mvself
when
I
wrote.
My
teacher
gave
me
the
freedom
to
choose
any
personal
topic
that
I
desired
to
write
about.
I
wrote
about
my
sister's
problem
with
drug
abuse
and
how
it
affected
my
life.
The
moment
I
completed
that
paper,
I
felt
very
confident
that
it
was
the
finest
I
had
ever
written.
The
finished
product
amazed
me
because
I
never
realized
how
much
talent
was
hidden
inside
of
me.
The
response
that
I
got
from
readers
was
unlike
any
that
I
had
ever
received.
Mrs.
McLaughlin
enjoyed
it
so
much
that
she
asked
me
if
I
"ever
thought
of
sending
it
in
as
my
college
essay."
She
was
astonished
that
I
could
write
something
so
personal
and
powerful.
When
I
brought
it
home
for
my
mother
to
read,
she
said
that
it
was
the
best
that
she'd
ever
seen
me
write.
That
paper
boosted
the
esteem
and
confidence
in
my
writing.
I
followed
my
English
teacher's
advice
and
wrote
a
spin-off
of
that
paper
in
several
of
my
college
essays.
Writing
about
personal
experiences
drove
me
to
love
writing
and
what
I
was
writing
about.
The
feeling
that
I
captured,
from
writing
personal
experiences,
was
tremendous.
My
writing
became
more
vivid
and
alive
by
writing
about
happenings
that
impacted
my
life
than
writing
about
subjects
I
read
from
a
book.
When
I
began
college,
I
was
unsure
where
my
writing
would
take
me.
The
requirements
that
college
writing
would
ask
of
me
were
vague.
I
imagined
students
sitting
in
a
library
with
sweat
pouring
down
the
sides
of
their
faces
trying
to
finish
their
perfect,
one
hundred
page
term
papers.
I
was
intimidated
by
the
fact
that
some
college
students
were
able
to
publish
their
writing.
I
did
not
believe
that
my
talent
came
even
close
to
those
in
college.
I
was
not
sure
that
I
was
prepared
to
meet
the
challenge
of
writing
intelligently
and
sharing
it
with
the
world.
I
carried
my
loving
feeling
toward
writing
and
my
fears
from
high
school
into
college.
My
First
Year
Seminar
did
not
allow
me
to
write
on
any
topic
that
I
wished
because
it
was
focused
around
Germany
from
1945
to
the
present.
Although,
I
found
out
that
I
loved
writing
no
matter
what
the
topic
was.
Something
happened
to
me
in
Mrs.
McLaughlin's
class
that
spurred
me
to
love
writing.
I
believe
that
it
was
the
self
confidence
that
her
class
gave
me
that
allowed
me
to
believe
in
whatever
I
wrote.
The
introduction
to
the
Writing
Associate,
conferences
with
my
professor,
and
the
continuance
of
peer
evaluations,
in
the
class,
allowed
my
writing
to
grow
even
more
because
I
had
the
continued
view
of
others
on
what
I
wrote.
I
became
more
confident
that
I
could
keep
up
with
the
high
expectations
that
I
had
of
college
writers.
When
I
was
introduced
to
the
topic
of
my
First
Year
Writing
class,
it
was
a
dream
come
true.
My
professor
had
unbelievable
proposal
in
store
for
the
class.
She
proposed
that
each
student
choose
any
topic
that
he/she
felt
comfortable
writing
about
for
the
whole
semester
and
begin
to
write
a
book.
In
the
beginning,
I
felt
that
my
professor
was
out
of
her
mind
when
she
expected
us
to
do
something
of
that
magnitude,
but
as
time
went
on
I
had
confidence
that
I
could
be
successful.
In
the
First
Year
Writing
class
I
kept
a
journal
to
monitor
my
writing
progress
as
I
wrote
about
my
sister's
problem
with
drug
abuse
and
my
life
with
her.
I
valued
the
writing
journal
because
if
I
was
lost
for
words,
I
could
look
at
past
journals
and
maybe
spot
an
idea
that
I
had
forgotten
about.
Also,
in
the
class,
I
used
peer
evaluations
and
teacher
conferences
to
assist
me
in
developing
vivid
and
interesting
papers
that
stayed
focused
around
the
conflict
at
hand,
from
an
outsider's
point
of
view.
I
am
truly
amazed
at
the
reactions
of
my
latest
writing.
I
feel
that
it
is
the
best
that
it
has
ever
been,
but
still
subject
to
growth.
My
First
Year
Writing
professor
seemed
to
relate
with
my
excitement
in
writing
about
personal
experiences.
The
remarks
on
my
finished
papers
make
me
feel
that
all
of
the
hard
work
and
multiple
drafts
has
paid
off.
Comments
such
as
"Bravo"
and
I
am
"excited
to
have
you
as
a
student
in
my
class"
make
me
feel
that
people
are
truly
enjoying
what
I
have
to
write.
My
writing
does
not
have
the
feeling
of
schoolwork
anymore
because
I
love
what
I
am
writing
about.
Statements
that
classmates
have
written
on
peer
evaluations,
such
as
"I
would
really
like
to
read
this
book"
and
"I
hope
you
do
finish
this
book",
have
given
me
the
confidence
to
show
my
papers
to
my
family
and
friends.
After
my
mother
read
my
latest
paper,
from
my
First
Year
Writing
class,
she
cried
and
told
me
how
wonderful
it
was
because
she
could
actually
see
everything
happening
while
reading
it.
My
sister
agreed
with
my
mother
and
even
asked
for
a
copy
for
her
to
keep.
Remarks
such
as
these
boost
my
confidence
that
my
writing
will
improve
as
I
continue
my
education.
