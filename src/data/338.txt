Writing
like
a
WA
Eight
months
ago,
I
felt
that
my
writing
had
improved
over
the
fall
semester;
not
just
because
of
the
new
assignments
I
had
been
writing,
but
because
of
a
newly
critical
eye
with
which
I
judged
my
own
writing.
Before
becoming
a
WA,
I
had
expected
to
be
emphasizing
revision
and
rewriting
during
my
conferences,
but
I
hadn't
realized
what
an
impact
that
would
have
on
my
own
writing.
I
would
have
felt
hypocritical
stressing
the
need
for
students
to
take
our
discussions
and
use
the
ideas
to
rework
their
papers
while
I
continued
to
write
last-minute
papers
that
were
often
not
even
proofread,
never
mind
rewritten.
I
thought
about
my
bad
writing
habits
before
beginning
fall
semester
and
decided
to
take
a
second
look
at
the
quality
of
papers
these
habits
had
produced.
The
class
I
worked
with
last
fall
happened
to
be
the
same
FYS
that
I
had
taken
during
my
freshman
year
at
Lafayette.
Before
returning
to
school,
I
dug
up
my
old
papers
and
re-read
them,
trying
to
get
a
feel
for
my
own
writing
as
a
freshman,
and
also
for
the
assignments
I
would
be
reading.
Looking
at
my
papers,
I
realized
there
were
many
things
I
would
like
to
change
about
them.
I
started
looking
for
points
to
improve
upon,
rather
than
merely
checking
to
see
if
the
paper
was
good
enough
to
turn
in
to
the
professor.
This
was
perhaps
the
biggest
flaw
in
my
writing
style:
whereas
most
of
my
papers
were
always
"good
enough"
I
realized
that
most
were
also
not
as
good
as
they
could
have
been.
Many
writers
that
I
worked
with
were
similar
to
me
in
this
aspect.
Improvement
was
one
of
the
points
I
tried
to
stress
in
conferences
where
I
felt
that
the
paper
in
front
of
us
was
already
of
high
quality.
During
my
writing
conferences,
one
or
two
of
the
better
writers
ceased
to
bring
in
first
drafts
of
their
papers,
explaining
that
their
work
would
receive
an
"A"
without
their
effort
to
retool
the
first
draft.
Since
this
had
been
my
attitude
in
a
number
of
previous
classes,
I
understood
their
position,
but
as
a
WA
I
could
not
accept
it.
I
explained
to
these
students
that
even
if
their
writing
was
already
meeting
this
professor's
standards,
there
was
no
guarantee
that
it
would
meet
the
standards
of
the
next
teacher.
I
told
them
that
throughout
my
college
career,
I
had
been
called
upon
to
submit
writing
samples
for
many
different
applications,
from
scholarships,
to
internships,
to
study
abroad
programs.
For
these
applications
I
needed
my
writing
to
stand
out,
to
set
me
apart,
and
to
communicate
not
only
the
subject
I
was
writing
about,
but
also
the
fact
that
I
was
a
bright
student
who
could
intelligently
convey
my
ideas.
Moreover,
some
of
these
applications
called
for
papers
I
had
previously
written
for
a
class
in
order
to
gauge
my
ability
as
an
academic
writer,
so
it
was
necessary
to
have
some
papers
I
could
truly
be
proud
of.
I
tried
to
explain
how
important
it
is
to
have
writing
that
is
not
just
decent,
but
of
superior
quality.
And
when
I
explained
this
to
the
students
I
was
working
with,
I
realized
it
really
rang
true
for
myself,
and
I
think
it
was
this
realization
that
most
affected
my
writing
while
I
was
a
WA.
As
I
have
mentioned,
my
biggest
problem
in
my
writing
has
always
been
the
fact
that
I
write
just
before
the
deadline,
and
so
often
do
not
have
time
to
proofread
or
revise
papers.
At
worst,
this
gives
my
writing
an
unorganized,
confused
feeling,
with
too
much
detail
on
some
points,
and
bare
outlines
of
others.
At
best,
I
let
a
few
misused
words
escape
into
my
papers.
I
cannot
say
I
totally
lost
this
habit
during
my
time
as
a
WA,
but
I
did
make
more
of
an
effort
to
reread
and
revise
my
papers
before
they
had
already
been
graded.
This
worked
better
in
some
cases
than
others.
In
a
government
class
I
took
on
Eastern
Europe
the
professor
required
us
to
write
one
to
two
page
arguments
based
on
our
readings
and
lectures
of
the
past
week.
In
these
papers,
she
wanted
us
to
completely
summarize
the
readings,
present
an
original
viewpoint
based
on
these
readings,
and
argue
this
new
hypothesis
fully
and
clearly.
With
a
minimum
of
two
hundred
pages
of
readings
per
week,
condensing
this
information
into
four
or
five
paragraphs
was
difficult,
and
my
first
few
papers
were
returned
with
bad
marks
because
I
had
excluded
key
facts
or
support.
I
was
too
hung
up
on
summarizing
the
readings
and
did
not
spend
enough
time
arguing
my
thesis.
If
I
tried
cutting
down
on
summary
though,
the
paper
was
returned
with
criticisms
saying
I
didn't
demonstrate
my
knowledge
of
the
readings.
Finally,
by
pure
luck,
I
earned
an
"A"
on
a
paper.
I
reread
this
paper
and
tried
to
differentiate
it
from
my
past
failures.
I
noticed
that
my
introduction
had
served
a
double
purpose
as
the
review
of
the
information,
and
although
it
was
very
brief,
mentioned
all
the
topics
that
my
professor
had
also
discussed
in
class.
From
there
on,
the
paper
was
entirely
my
argument
against
one
of
the
author's
theories,
using
his
own
quotations
almost
entirely
for
my
support.
In
this
way,
I
demonstrated
an
understanding
of
the
material,
but
was
still
able
to
spend
less
time
on
summarization
than
argumentation.
It
took
me
four
papers
and
a
month
of
the
course,
but
I
figured
out
the
acceptable
format
for
these
papers,
and
from
then
on
carefully
read
all
of
my
response
papers
to
ensure
they
followed
this
format
before
turning
them
in.
This
worked
well
for
me,
and
when
it
came
time
to
write
a
term
paper
for
this
course
I
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
revising
my
fifteen
pages
of
writing
to
fit
an
extended
version
of
this
format.
Again,
my
efforts
paid
off.
I
was
not
so
lucky
in
my
other
government
class:
a
seminar
on
political
parties
in
the
US.
This
professor
required
only
three
written
assignments
over
the
course
of
the
semester.
The
first
assignment
was
a
take-home
midterm
exam
in
which
we
were
to
compose
ten
to
twelve
pages
answering
two
questions
that
drew
upon
our
classroom
learning,
past
reading
assignments,
and
outside
research.
We
had
a
week
to
complete
the
exam.
I
spent
the
first
three
days
researching
both
questions
and
the
next
three
days
perfecting
my
answer
to
the
first
question.
I
had
seven
pages
of
clear,
well
thought
out
writing
that
I
had
read
and
revised
numerous
times
while
writing
it.
I
kept
changing
words
to
find
a
better
nuance,
and
rearranging
sentences
to
make
sure
my
reader
could
follow
my
argument
easily,
even
though
I
knew
my
response
was
already
"good
enough."
This
revision,
however,
left
me
almost
no
time
for
the
second
essay.
It
was
sloppy,
and
not
only
did
I
not
have
enough
time
to
revamp
the
second
essay;
I
barely
had
time
to
write
it.
I
ended
up
with
three
pages
of
research
clumsily
thrown
together.
I
had
answered
the
question,
but
it
was
hard
to
understand
what
my
answer
was.
I
realized
that
unless
I
could
devote
a
great
deal
more
time
to
the
next
exam,
I
would
have
to
concentrate
less
on
improving
the
first
question,
and
more
on
simply
writing
both
responses.
The
professor
was
not
expecting
a
project
with
only
a
week's
worth
of
work
to
be
of
the
same
quality
as
a
term
paper
and
so
I
didn't
need
the
same
attention
to
revision
that
I
would
have
paid
a
term
paper.
I
took
my
efforts
to
improve
my
writing
out
of
the
best
context
for
this
situation
and
ended
up
creating
a
piece
of
lower
quality
than
my
normal
compositions.
The
final
exam
for
this
class
was
of
the
same
format,
and
I
allotted
my
time
more
appropriately
the
second
time
around.
This
same
class
had
a
fifteen-page
term
paper
assigned
on
a
topic
of
our
own
choosing.
Our
grade
for
this
paper
depended
on
our
first
draft,
our
peer
review
of
a
classmate's
first
draft,
and
our
final
copy
averaged
together.
I
knew
my
first
draft
was
a
great
introduction
to
my
paper;
its
only
flaw
was
that
I
had
yet
to
actually
begin
my
argument
in
the
six
pages
I
handed
in.
I
knew
this
was
a
problem
but
I
simply
did
not
have
enough
time
to
start
drawing
my
conclusions
and
proving
my
thesis.
Also,
all
six
of
my
introductory
pages
were
necessary
for
my
paper.
Besides
proving
my
topic
worthy
of
discussion,
I
had
to
defend
all
my
data
and
definitions
from
the
beginning
to
strengthen
my
argument
as
much
as
possible.
It
was
even
possible
to
expand
the
discussion
in
those
six
pages
to
fill
the
entire
fifteen-page
requirement.
Of
course
I
realized
I
needed
to
narrow
my
topic
by
this
time,
but
it
was
too
late.
My
research
was
not
transferable
to
any
other
relevant
topic
and
it
would
take
too
long
to
first
choose
and
then
research
a
completely
new
thesis.
I
decided
to
turn
in
this
very
rough
draft
and
continue
my
research
and
writing.
My
professor
immediately
noticed
the
fault
in
the
paper
I
turned
in,
and
commented
on
it
in
her
evaluation.
She
said
she
was
clear
on
what
I
intended
my
topic
to
be,
but
not
clear
that
I
had
actually
written
a
paper
on
that
topic.
She
suggested
clarifying
my
thesis
somewhat,
explaining
why
so
much
definition
and
specification
was
necessary,
and
beginning
to
incorporate
my
research.
My
peer
review
was
just
as
helpful,
mentioning
that
just
when
they
felt
I
was
getting
into
my
topic,
the
paper
ended.
I
knew
all
of
this
already,
so
the
critique
of
my
first
draft
was
not
helpful
to
me.
By
the
time
I
finished
the
final
copy,
these
issues
were
no
longer
a
problem;
although
my
paper
was
more
vague
than
I
would
have
liked,
it
was
at
least
a
completed
paper,
and
formed
a
cogent
argument.
It
still
needed
some
polishing
though,
and
I
remember
thinking
that
I
would
be
better
off
if
I
could
have
handed
in
this
completed
paper
for
my
first
peer
review.
Besides
beginning
to
place
more
of
an
emphasis
on
revision
of
my
papers,
the
most
meaningful
lesson
I
have
learned
about
my
writing
since
becoming
a
WA
is
that
I
need
constant
practice
to
keep
it
at
a
decent
quality.
A
semester
spent
studying
abroad
in
Seville,
Spain
honed
my
Spanish
grammar
and
vocabulary
skills,
but
weakened
their
English
counterparts.
My
English
writing
was
restricted
to
emails
and
journal
entries,
as
I
had
no
cause
to
write
an
academic
composition.
Even
now,
sitting
down
at
my
computer
to
write
an
organized,
thoughtful
essay
has
been
difficult
for
me,
since
I
have
not
tried
this
in
over
eight
months.
Everything
I
wrote
while
in
Spain
was
a
complete
departure
from
my
normal
writing
style.
I
had
to
adjust
to
a
new
way
of
life
and
with
it,
a
new
way
of
writing.
I
lived
with
an
elderly
Spanish
senora
who
spoke
no
English,
and
took
all
but
one
of
my
five
classes
in
Spanish.
All
of
my
interactions
with
the
Sevillanos
took
place
in
Spanish,
from
ordering
food
and
explaining
the
haircut
I
desired,
to
booking
trips
to
Germany
and
the
Canary
Islands
in
the
local
travel
agencies.
In
order
to
travel
outside
of
Spain,
I
also
learned
basic
phrases
and
vocabulary
in
French,
German,
and
Italian.
And
although
I
had
American
friends
with
whom
I
could
speak
English,
most
of
my
four
months
overseas
was
spent
speaking
Spanish.
I
am
now
able
to
understand
nearly
everything
I
hear
spoken
in
Spanish
and
my
writing
and
verbal
skills
are
only
slightly
secondary
to
my
comprehension.
What
I
did
not
realize
until
I
returned
home
was
that
this
growth
was
slowly
replacing
the
more
sophisticated
English
vocabulary
that
allowed
me
to
explore
subtle
nuances
and
to
express
more
sophisticated
thoughts.
I
had
taken
Spanish
classes
at
Lafayette
before
I
left
which
had
required
me
to
write
essays
entirely
in
Spanish,
but
these
were
essays
for
an
English-speaking
professor,
and
usually
on
topics
of
my
own
choosing.
In
Spain,
three
of
my
professors
spoke
no
English.
Two
of
these
professors
determined
our
grades
based
solely
on
three
examinations
in
essay
form
composed
during
the
class
period.
The
most
important
objective
in
writing
these
essays
was
to
compress
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
information
into
each
composition.
For
my
art
class
the
professor
would
show
slides
of
works
we
had
studied
on
a
screen
for
five
minutes
each.
We
were
expected
to
list
the
title
of
the
piece,
its
creator,
the
era
it
was
done
in,
and
then
go
on
to
describe
the
work
in
detail,
including
any
anecdotes
she
had
mentioned
about
it
during
class,
and
our
personal
response
to
the
artwork
in
front
of
us.
After
doing
this
for
the
first
slide
of
the
first
exam,
I
quickly
realized
that
the
organization,
wording,
and
grammar
of
my
writing
were
not
important
considerations.
Remembering
all
the
information
I
had
crammed
into
my
head
about
the
hundreds
of
slides
we
had
studied,
racking
my
brain,
and
searching
my
dictionary
for
appropriate
vocabulary
in
Spanish
was
all
I
had
time
for.
Every
fact
I
remembered
was
scribbled
down
as
soon
as
it
came
into
my
head.
My
history
essays
were
composed
in
much
the
same
way,
although
for
these
compositions
I
at
least
had
a
rough
chronological
outline
to
guide
me.
Yet
still,
if
I
remembered
an
important
quote
by
General
Franco
late
in
the
exam,
I
would
not
hesitate
to
toss
it
into
the
middle
of
an
unrelated
paragraph
on
the
transition
to
the
European
Union.
Getting
all
of
the
facts
I
remembered
unto
the
paper
took
precedence
over
all
other
concerns.
This
type
of
writing
was
unlike
anything
I
have
ever
attempted;
not
even
in
high
school
did
I
write
essays
like
these.
Besides
the
fact
that
they
were
usually
three
or
four
pages
of
a
foreign
language,
written
over
the
space
of
an
hour,
they
were
simply
repetitions
of
the
facts
and
trivia
I
had
memorized.
In
other
written
essays
I
had
been
assigned,
there
was
always
an
element
of
analysis,
hypothesis,
or
contemplation
of
the
material
at
hand.
In
Spain,
the
professors
only
cared
that
you
could
recite
their
lessons
back
to
them.
In
a
way,
I
suppose
this
method
of
writing
was
good
for
me.
The
essays
were
easier
for
me
to
write
in
a
foreign
language,
because
I
was
not
struggling
for
words
to
express
a
new
concept;
rather,
my
task
was
simply
to
quickly
reword
phrases
I
had
memorized
from
my
notes.
Furthermore,
I
felt
much
less
pressure
to
write
well
during
these
exams,
because
I
knew
that
was
nearly
impossible
for
me.
Instead,
I
concentrated
completely
on
the
content,
and
wrote
down
every
thought
I
had.
My
normal
writing
style
is
almost
exactly
the
opposite
of
this,
with
a
very
careful
emphasis
on
the
wording
and
style
of
my
sentences.
Sometimes
I
will
be
so
frustrated
by
my
inability
to
express
an
idea
in
a
style
that
pleases
me,
that
I
will
eliminate
that
idea
from
the
paragraph.
This
obviously
impedes
my
writing
at
times.
I
am
hoping
that
I
can
take
a
lesson
from
my
writing
in
Spain
and
begin
to
jot
down
each
and
every
thought
I
want
to
include
as
it
comes
to
me,
and
only
later
choose
the
exact
phrasing
and
style
for
each
sentence.
As
for
writing
in
the
English
language
while
abroad,
I
kept
a
journal
regularly
and
wrote
close
to
twenty
pages
each
week
chronicling
my
experiences,
my
travels,
my
adventures,
and
my
pitfalls.
I
had
not
done
writing
like
this
for
nearly
seven
years,
but
when
I
was
younger,
I
wrote
in
a
diary
every
night
and
described
all
the
high
and
low
points
of
each
day.
I
also
wrote
many
short
stories
at
this
age,
and
each
story
was
filled
with
small
details
that
I
would
never
think
to
include
if
writing
a
fiction
today.
During
the
years
since
I
stopped
doing
descriptive
writing,
it
would
seem
I
had
forgotten
how
to
use
an
adjective.
I
realized
sometime
in
my
first
month
of
journal
writing
that
I
was
going
to
have
to
concentrate
more
on
the
details
if
I
wanted
my
writing
to
paint
an
accurate
and
lively
picture
of
my
life
in
Seville.
I
wanted
to
be
able
to
read
my
stories
in
five
years
and
still
laugh
or
cry
because
my
writing
brought
back
such
vivid
memories.
I
started
describing
the
location
where
I
was
writing
each
entry;
relaying
what
I
was
seeing,
hearing,
smelling
and
feeling
even
before
I
began
writing
about
what
I
planned
on
writing
about.
I
tried
to
stop
saying
generalities
such
as
"The
Coliseum
was
really
amazing,
and
our
tour
guide
was
really
informed
and
interesting
too,"
and
move
to
a
more
specific
description:
"The
stray
cats
lazily
sunning
themselves
on
the
grassy
ruins
of
the
Coliseum's
bleachers
seemed
out
of
place
as
our
tour
guide
described
the
Emperor
Caligula's
growing
insanity
and
its
gruesome
manifestations
in
the
battles
he
orchestrated."
This
reminds
me
of
the
cats
which
ran
rampant
all
over
Rome,
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
tour
in
my
opinion,
and
what
it
was
like
to
see
the
Coliseum
today
while
picturing
it
in
its
former
glory.
My
early
journal
entries
don't
give
me
a
clear
impression
of
what
I
was
feeling
and
seeing,
and
although
at
times
my
later
entries
might
sound
as
if
a
cheap
romance
novelist
wrote
them,
at
least
they
trigger
more
colorful
memories.
I
hope
that
I
can
keep
improving
my
descriptive
writing
over
time,
because
although
I
do
not
use
it
often,
it
makes
every
story
I
tell
that
much
more
interesting.
Like
my
newfound
talent
for
speedwriting
in
Spanish,
I
hope
to
incorporate
this
type
of
writing
into
my
academic
papers
over
the
coming
year.
So
how
has
my
writing
changed
since
I
have
been
a
WA?
Well,
I
now
take
it
more
seriously,
so
although
I
continue
to
write
as
close
to
the
deadline
as
possible,
I
now
leave
enough
time
to
work
through
at
least
two
drafts.
And
although
my
writing
skills
are
rusty
from
my
time
spent
in
Spain,
I
think
my
efforts
to
improve
my
writing
have
paid
off.
I
can
only
wait
and
see
if
my
new
habits
from
Spain
will
ingrain
themselves
in
my
written
style,
or
if
I
will
have
any
opportunities
this
year
to
cultivate
these
skills.
Regardless,
I
hope
that
the
year
to
come
brings
even
greater
improvements
in
both
my
writing
and
my
conferences.
