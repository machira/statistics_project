Literary
Narrative
Project
for
WA
Workshop
Fall
2002
When
I
was
approximately
four
and
a
half
years
old,
I
spent
much
of
my
time
drawing
scenes
of
my
family,
my
friends,
my
stuffed
animals,
and
myself.
I
think
these
pictures
could
be
considered
my
first
attempts
at
writing
because
they
conveyed
through
images
what
I
was
not
yet
able
to
articulate
in
words:
my
imagination
and
my
reactions
to
the
surrounding
world.
To
compare
these
primitive
crayon
portrayals
to
any
kind
of
cave
painting
or
hieroglyphics
would
be
a
tremendous
exaggeration,
but
I
think
the
idea
of
expression
that
I
had
then
was
the
beginning
of
the
way
I
express
myself
now.
I
had
my
own
code
of
scribble
that
explained
my
drawings,
and
I
was
able
to
read
back
to
my
parents
what
it
said.
Thus,
I
must
have
had
some
concept
of
language
and
letters
at
that
time.
My
first
attempts
at
coherent
physical
writing
occurred
within
the
following
year,
when
I
learned
how
to
spell
and
print
my
own
name
and
the
names
of
others.
Even
so,
these
names
still
only
served
as
captions
for
my
drawings;
a
transition
from
pictures
to
words.
This
shift
was
accelerated
when
my
mother
began
to
record
stories
as
I
dictated
them-
usually
they
were
journal
entries
describing
where
I
had
gone
and
with
whom,
and
my
feelings
about
my
day.
At
the
same
time,
my
parents
were
teaching
me
to
read
and
also
reading
to
me
constantly;
this
introduced
me
to
the
idea
of
poems,
rhymes
and
"chapter
stories."
In
response,
I
wrote
many
very
early
poems
titled
"For
Dad"
or
"For
Mom"
about
topics
I
thought
they
liked,
such
as
horses,
our
family
dog,
and
hugs.
I
also
invented
several
chapters
called
"The
Witch
Family"
about
a
family
of
witches
(who
were
basically
my
parents,
my
younger
"baby"
sister,
our
dog,
and
myself)
and
their
rivalry
with
the
evil
girl,
Megan
(who
happened
to
share
her
name
with
my
older
sister).
In
retrospect,
it
is
very
interesting
that
the
major
unifying
theme
in
all
these
pieces
was
that
they
were
done
for
fun.
I
wrote
them
either
to
do
something
nice
for
my
parents
or
to
entertain
myself,
long
before
I
even
considered
that
writing
could
be
assigned
as
homework
or
that
there
were
so
many
different
forms
of
writing.
These
realizations
came
about
over
the
next
several
years
during
elementary
school
and
junior
high.
There
I
learned
how
intricate
the
different
types
of
writing
could
be.
I
remember
one
elementary
school
unit
in
which
we
composed
a
series
of
letters
about
the
same
topic,
however
each
was
done
in
a
different
letter
format
(business,
personal,
etc).
I
was
also
taught
the
process
of
writing,
including
drafts,
revision,
peer
editing,
and
constructive
criticism.
Everything
was
very
carefully
explained,
and
the
different
genres
of
writing
were
emphasized
through
countless
book
reports,
poetry
and
creative
writing
projects,
mini
research
assignments,
and
even
class
contests
to
send
argument
papers
to
the
television
show,
"Assignment
the
World,"
on
PBS.
A
key
experience
that
incorporated
almost
all
of
these
newly
learned
writing
forms
took
place
in
sixth
grade.
Every
year,
each
local
elementary
school
formed
their
own
debate
team
comprised
of
sixth
graders
in
L.E.P.,
the
Learning
Enrichment
Program,
and
these
teams
competed
against
each
other.
I
was
placed
in
L.E.P.
in
kindergarten,
and
from
that
very
first
year
I
was
excited
for
sixth
grade,
when
I
would
be
able
to
participate
in
the
debate.
During
the
preparation
for
our
debate
on
capital
punishment,
my
team
and
I
had
to
write
a
lot:
countless
letters
to
receive
information
about
our
topic,
weekly
proposals
to
our
teacher
in
order
to
update
her
on
our
plans,
a
journal
documenting
our
progress,
reports
on
information
we
received
from
different
sources,
several
rebuttals
and
arguments
to
serve
as
the
core
of
our
debate,
and
brief
creative
pieces
for
our
introduction
and
closing.
This
debate
was
basically
the
peak
of
everything
I
had
learned
about
writing
during
elementary
school
primarily
because
it
encapsulated
such
a
variety
of
forms
and
took
so
much
time-
about
half
the
school
year
in
preparation
for
one
night
of
debate.
It
was
a
great
opportunity
to
utilize
everything
I
had
been
taught
and
a
good
marker
of
how
much
of
that
information
I
had
retained.
Throughout
all
of
these
new
experiences,
I
continued
writing
journal
entries
on
my
own
from
time
to
time-
particularly
during
the
summer
when
we
went
on
family
vacations.
It
is
amazing
how
different
the
tone
of
my
journal
narrative
was
from
that
of
my
school
assignments:
I
sounded
much
more
my
age
in
my
journal
than
I
did
in
my
schoolwork.
During
one
trip
to
Cape
Cod
when
I
was
eleven,
I
wrote:
In
the
morning
we
drove
to
Hyannis
and
got
on
a
ferry
to
Martha's
Vineyard.
The
ride
on
the
ferry
took
one
and
a
half
hours.
We
met
the
Goldstein's
at
the
dock
and
they
took
us
straight
to
Longpoint
beach.
The
waves
there
were
the
biggest
I
had
ever
seen.
Rebecca
and
I
managed
to
swim
for
a
little
while
and
eventually
I
got
crashed
on
by
a
tidal
wave
so
we
decided
to
go
to
the
pond
that
was
nearby
the
beach...
After
dinner
we
went
to
Mad
Martha's
for
ice
cream
and
then
got
back
on
the
ferry
back
home.
The
entries
were
done
on
our
old
word
processor,
and
since
I
was
only
beginning
to
learn
to
use
computers
they
were
filled
with
grammatical
and
spelling
errors.
However,
I
did
not
show
the
journal
to
anyone
else,
so
it
must
have
given
me
a
chance
to
write
more
freely
and
balance
out
the
expectations
of
teachers
associated
with
school
assignments.
I
was
just
writing
the
journal
entries
to
remember
certain
things
and
vent
feelings,
not
to
attain
any
standard
or
receive
a
grade.
I
also
went
through
a
phase
in
which
I
started
recording
the
dreams
I
remembered
when
I
woke
up.
I
never
wrote
down
any
of
the
actual
dates,
but
they
are
numbered
chronologically
and
cover
a
wide
range
of
topics.
Of
everything
I
have
written,
these
entries
are
probably
the
most
unique
because
they
are
based
solely
on
what
I
remember
from
my
"subconscious."
I
did
not
take
the
time
to
write
down
my
reactions
to
them
or
explanations
for
them,
rather
they
are
just
descriptive
fragments
and
phrases
trying
to
recapture
what
I
had
dreamt
the
previous
night.
For
example,
in
a
shorter
one
I
wrote:
Roller
coaster
ride
w/
Tebbano
family.
Dark,
metal
structures,
very
high
up,
water
below?,
maybe
city
nearby.
Then
I'm
all
alone
and
have
to
be
in
car
going
over
huge
gap.
Falling
->
sometimes
I
make
it,
sometimes
it
changes.
Usually
@
night,
stars,
I'm
really
frightened
of
something.
Looking
back
I
can
think
of
a
few
possible
explanations,
but
I
cannot
be
entirely
sure
why
I
might
have
had
that
dream,
what
it
really
meant
at
the
time,
or
even
if
that
was
the
entire
dream.
The
importance
of
these
entries
is
the
style:
for
some
reason
the
fragmented
format
is
able
to
trigger
the
same
images
that
I
saw
when
I
was
asleep,
and
for
that
reason
alone
I
think
recording
them
was
very
valuable.
Even
though
no
one
else
is
probably
able
to
relate
to
a
particular
dream,
and
I
have
never
really
shown
anyone
the
entries,
it
is
as
if
by
writing
them
down
I
am
able
to
preserve
extra
memories
that
I
otherwise
would
have
forgotten.
These
entries
are
also
very
unique
because
they
contrast
so
much
with
the
other
forms
of
writing
I
was
required
to
do
for
school,
particularly
in
high
school.
Throughout
high
school
I
was
in
AP
classes,
and
it
was
in
these
classes
that
I
started
having
at
least
one
long
essay
to
write
per
week.
I
remember
benefiting
very
much
from
these
essays
at
first-
they
taught
me
to
analyze
the
literature
we
were
reading,
trace
themes,
respond
to
other
peoples'
ideas,
and
work
within
time
and
word
count
constraints.
While
the
purpose
was
to
train
us
to
produce
solid
essays,
I
felt
like
the
process
got
really
repetitive
after
a
while.
In
many
ways
I
felt
like
I
had
stopped
thinking
about
what
I
was
doing
and
instead
was
just
following
a
formula
to
receive
a
good
grade.
Peer
editing
was
not
really
valuable
at
the
time
because
everyone
was
learning
to
procrastinate
and
focus
on
the
social
aspects
of
high
school
rather
than
the
academic
aspect
of
it.
In
addition,
most
of
the
teacher
comments
I
received
during
the
first
two
years
of
high
school
were
minimal:
"Great
job!
A!
Nice
work!"
There
would
be
the
occasional
spelling
or
grammar
marking,
or
a
sporadic
question
about
what
I
was
saying,
but
all
in
all
it
felt
like
I
was
just
writing
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again.
Fortunately,
in
eleventh
grade
I
had
a
very
bright
English
teacher
who
did
not
believe
in
"learning
to
write
for
an
exam"
and
opted
to
re-introduce
us
to
a
variety
of
writing
over
the
traditional
back-to-back
essay
assignments.
In
one
case,
he
assigned
a
massive
project
in
which
we
not
only
had
to
write
a
long
research
paper
about
our
topic,
but
we
also
had
to
keep
a
journal,
come
up
with
a
creative
presentation,
and
write
a
reflective
paper
on
"lessons
learned"
from
our
projects.
For
the
first
time
in
a
while,
I
benefited
a
lot
from
the
feedback
I
was
given.
He
filled
my
project
with
comments,
questions
and
advice-
not
just
about
the
information,
but
about
the
process
of
writing
it
and
how
I
felt
about
what
I
had
learned.
While
he
wrote
many
positive
things
about
my
project,
one
of
the
most
valuable
pieces
of
advice
he
gave
to
me
came
at
the
end
of
his
comments:
"Just
don't
be
too
cynical."
I
was
somewhat
taken
aback
because
I
had
never
had
a
teacher
respond
to
my
work
like
that,
but
I
looked
back
through
what
I
had
written
and
realized
that
my
"formula
writing"
was
getting
somewhat
sarcastic
and
not
reflective
of
what
I
actually
felt
about
the
work.
This
was
not
really
a
dramatic
turning
point
by
any
means,
but
it
did
help
me
realize
that
I
needed
to
think
more
about
what
I
was
writing
in
order
to
convey
what
I
really
meant.
Just
as
my
crayon
pictures,
dream
and
journal
entries
had
done,
my
essays
and
assignments
needed
to
be
an
expression
of
what
I
felt
about
something.
I
had
mixed
emotions
about
what
to
expect
in
terms
of
college
writing.
On
one
hand,
I
had
already
taken
the
AP
English
exam
and
had
done
very
well,
so
I
not
only
placed
out
of
College
Writing
but
I
also
had
a
reassurance
of
my
abilities
as
a
writer.
On
the
other
hand,
I
knew
that
Lafayette
was
a
good
school
and
there
would
be
countless
other
good
writers.
I
knew
I
wanted
to
be
challenged
by
my
professors
and
have
the
opportunity
to
write
well
about
interesting
topics,
but
beyond
that
I
really
had
no
idea
what
the
level
of
writing
would
be.
I
did
not
even
know
what
a
WA
program
was
before
my
first
FYS
class,
and
I
did
not
know
that
I
would
be
utilizing
it
in
any
way.
During
my
first
semester
I
had
two
particularly
good
professors
who
challenged
me
to
write
well.
I
thought
my
FYS
professor
was
somewhat
eccentric
in
the
beginning,
but
he
was
also
very
intelligent
and
analytical
about
my
writing.
He
required
us
to
not
only
meet
with
our
WA,
but
to
turn
in
a
rough
draft
of
our
papers
so
he
would
have
a
chance
to
tear
through
them
before
we
handed
them
in
for
a
grade.
I
was
scared
of
this
method
at
first,
but
ultimately
I
found
his
suggestions
and
criticisms
very
helpful;
they
forced
me
to
tackle
my
thesis
from
every
possible
angle
and
be
sure
that
I
was
actually
proving
what
I
had
set
out
to
prove.
It
was
also
a
rare
opportunity
to
completely
rewrite
a
paper
and
realize
a
totally
different
approach
without
having
to
worry
about
making
a
mistake
the
first
time
through.
The
other
professor
I
found
to
be
very
effective
was
my
English
teacher
in
the
first
semester,
whose
comments
often
rivaled
the
length
of
my
papers.
She
had
us
write
two
weekly
responses
to
the
texts
we
were
studying
in
class-
one
about
a
choice
of
assigned
topics
that
she
would
give
us
for
that
particular
week
and
the
other
about
a
theme
we
had
chosen
to
trace
throughout
the
semester.
While
these
papers
were
only
a
page
or
two
in
length,
she
forced
me
to
make
every
sentence
important
and
demonstrative
of
my
point.
One
example
of
her
comments
was,
"Obviously,
most
of
your
sentences
could
be
the
basis
for
longer
discussions..
.If
you
develop
this
topic
into
your
paper,
here
are
a
couple
of
things
to
think
about..."
From
there,
she
listed
off
a
typed
page
of
ideas
and
reactions
to
what
I
wrote,
compelling
me
to
re-examine
each
sentence
and
consider
how
it
related
to
the
whole.
Even
though
I
received
good
grades
on
these
assignments,
her
emphasis
was
clearly
that
the
thought
and
revision
did
not
end
with
the
grade.
She
wanted
us
to
be
constantly
thinking
about
our
work
and
challenging
ourselves
to
be
our
own
toughest
critics.
As
a
result
of
what
I
was
learning,
my
writing
continued
to
improve.
Probably
not
the
best
example
of
my
writing,
but
one
of
my
best
experiences
as
a
writer
happened
during
second
semester
in
a
history
class.
We
were
assigned
a
huge,
semester-long
research
paper
relating
to
the
Battle
of
Vicksburg
on
a
thesis
of
our
choice.
I
spent
more
time
on
that
paper
in
the
library,
researching
material,
learning
about
the
battle
and
its
participants,
revising
and
completely
starting
over
than
I
had
ever
done
before
on
any
one
paper
in
my
entire
life.
By
the
time
it
was
due,
three
months
had
passed,
and
I
had
honestly
not
procrastinated
or
slacked
off
on
it
at
any
point.
Working
on
that
paper
was
the
hardest
I
had
ever
worked
at
any
assignment,
and
when
I
finally
stopped
toying
with
it
to
hand
it
in,
I
still
found
things
that
I
wanted
to
change
or
research
more
thoroughly.
I
was
really
proud
to
see
that
I
had
gone
from
knowing
absolutely
nothing
about
a
topic
to
making
myself
very
knowledgeable,
and
then
formulating
my
own
ideas
about
it
in
the
form
of
a
well-written
paper.
I
am
not
quite
sure
what
the
phrase
"college
level
writing"
means,
but
I
do
feel
that
I
was
very
well
prepared
to
handle
what
was
given
to
me
in
the
last
year.
I
definitely
acquired
the
ability
to
be
more
thoughtful
about
what
I
was
writing,
revise
my
work
more
thoroughly,
and
learn
from
other
peoples'
ideas
and
criticism.
I
got
a
lot
of
experience
in
improving
my
work.
One
of
the
nicest,
yet
random,
changes
that
I
have
noticed
since
last
fall
is
my
ability
to
write
equally
as
well
in
Spanish
as
in
English.
All
of
the
advice
and
revision
I
encountered
changed
my
process
of
writing
Spanish
papers.
Rather
than
writing
them
first
in
English
and
then
attempting
to
translate
them,
I
gained
the
ability
to
think
in
Spanish
while
I
was
doing
the
writing.
It
may
be
minor,
but
it
never
would
have
happened
if
I
had
not
been
constantly
forced
to
re-evaluate
my
writing
and
my
process
of
writing
in
the
past
year.
Just
as
my
writing
evolved
last
year
and
has
evolved
throughout
my
"history
as
a
writer,"
I
hope
that
it
continues
to
do
so
in
the
upcoming
years
of
college
writing.
Inevitably,
being
a
WA
this
fall
will
give
me
an
opportunity
to
learn
more
about
my
writing
style
as
well
as
to
pass
on
to
others
some
of
the
advice
I
have
received.
