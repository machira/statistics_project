Literacy
Narrative
In
contemplating
the
history
of
my
personal
writing
it
is
not
surprising
that
my
memories
of
composition
extend
as
far
as
I
can
remember.
One
of
the
biggest
troubles
that
I
have
had
to
overcome,
and
indeed
still
struggle
with,
is
being
stopped
before
I
even
begin.
I
tend,
at
least
in
my
personal
writing,
to
emulate
other
great
writers
and
brainstorm
to
an
excessive
degree,
to
the
point
of
being
paralyzed
by
the
fear
that
no
matter
what
I
write
it
will
never
be
as
great
as
them,
or
as
great
as
I
desire
it
to
be.
Over
time
I
have
also
realized
that
I
am
a
very
independent
writer,
in
the
sense
that
I
give
little
credence
to
what
others
think
my
writing
should
be
or
do.
While
I
once
saw
this
as
a
great
strength,
I
have
come
to
realize
that
this
was
in
fact
one
of
my
greatest
weaknesses.
Whilst
I
have
strived
to
overcome
the
faults
of
my
youth,
there
are
some
patterns
I
simply
cannot
break,
lending
to
a
distinctive
writing
style
permeates
my
body
of
work.
My
earliest
memory
of
writing
was
in
first
grade
when
we
were
required
to
keep
a
journal.
At
this
time
writing
was
deeply
connected
with
pictures
and
drawing.
We
were
given
a
theme
to
draw
a
picture
from,
then
commented
on
the
picture
with
a
couple
of
sentences.
Writing
wasnOt
tedious
or
forced;
it
was
what
we
wanted
to
do
to
express
ourselves
and
show
what
it
was
that
we
found
important.
It
wasnOt
until
fifth
grade
that
I
took
a
legitimate
independent
interest
in
writing.
The
first
formal
school
assignment
that
I
remember
was
a
short
story
composition,
very
open
ended.
I
used
think
I
unconsciously
used
pieces
from
popular
movies
such
as
Homeward
Bound
coupled
with
my
affinity
for
animals
to
create
a
quest
narrative
about
a
boy
who
has
lost
his
dog
and
then
must
go
on
an
adventure
to
find
him.
As
I
still
tend
to
do
today
with
creative
writing,
I
borrowed
heavily
from
real
life
experiences
and,
to
a
lesser
extent,
other
books
and
movies.
For
example,
the
dog
was
the
same
breed
and
had
the
same
name
as
family
friendOs
pet.
Peer
editing
was
done
by
the
sixth
graders
and
I
remember
after
reading
the
comments
I
was
quite
insulted.
My
problem
I
realize
is
that
I
took
them
as
a
personal
affront,
a
way
of
being
told
that
I
am
not
competent
or
donOt
know
how
to
write.
Another
aspect
of
this
problem
is
that
I
viewed
some
changes
as
contrary
to
what
I
am
trying
to
convey,
so
if
I
actually
implemented
them
the
work
wouldnOt
be
mine,
or
wouldnOt
be
showing
my
ideas,
but
rather
someone
elseOs.
While
their
analysis
was
completely
warranted,
I
think
that
was
the
start
of
my
avoidance
of
criticism
of
my
work.
Also
at
this
time
I
had
my
first
foray
into
creative
writing
for
pleasure,
though
my
motives
were
fairly
dubious.
The
impetus
for
this
writing
came
from
seeing
a
friendOs
short
story
work.
He
had
written
a
science
fiction
narrative.
Though
never
having
read
it,
I
marveled
at
its
incredible
length
and
ambition.
I
figured
if
he
could
write
an
epic
story
then
I
should
have
no
problem
in
doing
the
same
(I
was
rather
self-righteous
and
stubborn
as
a
child).
It
was
a
story
about
the
end
of
the
world
with
the
clich
nuclear
power
plant
accident
inciting
the
whole
matter.
I
am
certain
that
I
took
that
idea
from
some
movie
or
videogame
and
based
my
monsters
on
those
from
a
popular
computer
game
at
the
time.
As
I
think
back
now
I
have
as
a
rule
borrowed
elements
from
other
works
to
incorporate
into
my
own,
be
they
visuals,
writing
styles
or
simply
moods
that
I
got
when
I
viewed
them.
For
example,
in
a
subsequent
piece
I
based
the
setting
on
an
island
similar
to
that
in
the
short
story
The
Most
Dangerous
Game.
I
underscored
the
one
characterOs
perdition
by
borrowing
liberally
from
a
scene
from
the
movie
What
Dreams
May
Come
where
the
character
is
in
a
state
of
purgatory
in
a
room
filled
with
murky
water,
floating
objects
and
most
tragically
a
doomed
sense
of
confusion
and
anguish.
Finally
I
used
the
shapeless
wisp
of
dark
cloud
that
portrayed
the
enemies
in
the
videogame
Ico
to
personify
my
villain.
This
was
never
taken
to
an
extreme
(as
I
saw
it),
however,
as
I
only
used
inspiring
pieces
and
made
them
part
of
my
whole
work.
I
see
the
inherent
danger
in
this
as
an
adult,
though,
given
the
current
preoccupation
with
plagiarism
and
the
post-James
Frey
climate
of
the
literary
world
fixated
with
authenticity
(not
that
anything
of
mine
has
ever
been
published).
The
next
significant
event
in
my
writing
formation
came
in
the
seventh
grade.
Our
English
teacher
highly
valued
writing
so
for
her
class
we
had
to
write
a
journal
every
night
on
any
topic
we
liked,
provided
that
it
be
100
words
or
more.
This
was
very
daunting
at
first,
not
having
written
much
up
to
that
point.
I
remember
struggling
for
starting
ideas
at
times,
but
was
always
surprised
how
easy
it
was
to
write
once
I
had
started.
Though
I
wrote
about
some
of
the
most
inane
subjects
sometimes,
such
as
stooping
to
describe
a
magazine
I
had
received
one
day,
my
writing
and
confidence
in
my
abilities
grew
immensely.
Knowing
I
had
to
write
every
night
and
seeing
my
common
mistakes
took
the
mystery
out
of
composition.
It
was
also
in
this
year
that
I
was
chosen
to
be
published
in
a
compilation
of
middle
school
works
for
a
poem
that
I
wrote
as
an
assignment.
This
came
recently
after
the
passing
of
my
uncle
so
I
wrote
my
poem
as
a
reaction
to
that.
I
focused
more
on
putting
my
feelings
into
a
physical
form
than
recounting
any
actual
events.
I
found
it
incredibly
therapeutic.
That
was
really
the
start
of
my
personal
writing
to
express
myself.
The
first
two
years
of
my
tenure
at
high
school
were
marked
by
more
creative
writing
assignments
and
comments
on
literary
works,
though
nothing
as
formal
as
a
full
paper.
It
was
in
this
time
that
I
read
and
was
strongly
influenced
by
Poe,
just
as
I
was
strongly
affected
by
science
fiction/horror
movies
and
books
in
my
youth.
It
was
the
combination
of
all
three
that
gave
my
creative
writing
a
macabre
touch
and
proclivity
for
twist
endings.
This
was
also
the
first
time
that
I
wrote
a
persuasive
essay,
but
it
was
far
from
wholehearted.
I
never
have
been
one
to
be
fanatic
over
any
specific
issue
so
I
used
most
of
the
arguments
on
a
religious
website
to
argue
against
abortion.
The
problem
was
that
I
donOt
think
there
was
any
issue
on
which
I
was
completely
decided;
I
have
always
been
able
to
see
both
sides
of
an
issue.
At
any
rate
the
focus
of
our
writing
shifted
in
the
last
two
years
to
emphasize
the
proper
construction
of
research
papers.
We
had
to
buy
a
book
similar
to
the
St.
MartinOs
Handbook
and
we
had
workshops
on
common
questions
and
problems
concerning
paper
writing.
The
biggest
challenge
I
faced
was
differentiating
between
the
purpose
of
the
assignment:
to
write
a
report
on
a
topic
or
to
prove
a
thesis.
In
this
time
and
before
I
consistently
did
the
former.
I
entered
into
my
college
career
with
a
certain
trepidation
in
reference
to
my
skills
because
let
the
media
give
me
a
false
idea
of
what
the
expectations
of
college
writing
were.
IOm
not
saying
that
it
doesnOt
require
work,
just
that
you
donOt
have
to
write
some
mind-blowing,
genre
defining
piece
filled
with
ten
cent
words.
The
majority
of
my
writings
at
college
have
been
research
papers,
critical
essays
and
economic
reports.
Research
papers
have
never
really
been
much
of
a
problem
for
me,
you
just
need
to
purport
a
thesis
then
through
a
logical
process
develop
it,
aided
by
credible
evidence.
The
researching
part
itself
was
daunting
at
first
but
I
have
since
come
to
understand
the
rhythm
of
researching
-
where
to
find
good
sources
and
how
to
work
through
them
as
quickly
as
possible.
I
still
tend
to
get
more
sources
than
I
need,
but
I
donOt
see
this
as
much
of
a
problem
given
that
I
donOt
generally
use
sources
excessively,
and
when
I
do
it
is
in
the
correct
context.
Critical
essays
have
always
been
the
easiest
to
do
for
me
because
I
enjoy
teasing
out
ideas
and
meaning
of
novels
using
extensive
in
text
materials.
The
economic
reports
are
the
driest
things
I
have
had
to
write.
While
the
form
is
set
in
stone
I
have
learned
that
the
content
is
malleable
to
the
personality
of
the
writer,
so
I
have
taken
what
I
like
to
call
a
Nhumanities
approachO
to
the
social
sciences,
infusing
my
reports
with
my
own
writing
style
while
maintaining
the
appropriate
tone
for
the
assignment.
Looking
back
I
struggled
with
some
behaviors
learned
in
high
school
but
have
since
learned
how
to
deal
with
most
of
them.
For
example,
I
was
taught
that
use
of
NIO
should
be
avoided
at
all
costs,
making
passive
voice
a
perfectly
acceptable
option,
only
to
learn
that
this
was
frowned
upon
by
most
professors.
I
also
worked
on
differentiating
between
writing
a
report
and
writing
a
paper
or
essay
where
you
have
to
prove
an
idea
that
you
introduce.
Undoubtedly
the
greatest
thing
that
I
have
received
from
college
writing
is
the
importance
of
revising
and
third
party
editing,
as
WAs
and
my
friends
have
pointed
out
several
foolish
mistakes
over
the
years.
What
differentiates
my
history
from
many
other
majors
is
that
I
did
this
work
in
English
and
Spanish
as
well.
So
there
was
the
added
complication
of
lacking
a
full
vocabulary
and
fluency
to
express
yourself.
I
have
come
to
be
very
comfortable
expressing
myself
in
Spanish,
though
I
still
have
some
problems
at
times.
Despite
this
fact
one
of
my
greatest
writing
achievements
is
a
satirical
poem
that
I
wrote,
given
a
specific
structure,
rhyme
scheme
and
syllabification.
Last
semester
I
studied
abroad
and
for
the
first
time
wrote
about
other
subjects
than
literature
and
culture
in
Spanish,
such
as
art
and
economics.
It
was
immeasurably
beneficial
to
me.
In
this
time
I
also
kept
a
journal.
I
have
had
one
since
I
was
about
fifteen
but
wrote
in
it
quite
infrequently,
usually
when
I
was
really
upset.
In
Spain
I
took
to
writing
in
it
several
times
a
week
about
my
experiences
or
whenever
something
was
inspiring
to
me.
As
my
experience
was
happening
in
Spanish
for
those
five
months
I
wrote
solely
in
Spanish.
I
continued
doing
this
when
I
got
back
to
the
US,
but
my
entries
unfortunately
have
become
much
more
infrequent.
While
looking
over
old
papers
this
summer
it
is
apparent
that
I
have
grown
over
the
years,
but
at
the
same
time
I
have
much
to
learn
before
I
could
consider
myself
a
good
academic
writer.
However
on
the
personal
side
of
writing
I
discovered
this
past
semester
how
enjoyable
it
is.
I
wholeheartedly
intend
to
continue
and
have
even
entertained
the
idea
of
being
a
writer.
This
is,
of
course,
more
of
a
passing
idea
but
I
still
think
that
I
have
a
great
deal
to
say
and
the
best
way
for
me
to
do
that
is
writing,
even
if
it
is
only
in
my
journal.
So
my
writing
remains
much
like
my
personality;
filled
with
vestiges
of
the
past
but
constantly
changing
to
fit
the
present.
