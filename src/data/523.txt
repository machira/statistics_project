During
the
spring
semester,
I
experienced
writing
from
a
different
perspective.
Over
the
course
of
four
months,
my
writing
went
through
the
full
cycle
of
development,
alternating
between
challenging,
eye-opening,
frustrating,
technical,
creative
and
rewarding,
among
other
things.
Sometimes
it
was
a
primitive
struggle
to
find
the
correct
word
to
express
my
thoughts,
other
times,
elaborate
descriptions
flowed
freely
from
the
tip
of
my
pen.
I
spent
four
months
with
endless
thoughts
in
my
mind,
but
not
enough
words
to
do
them
all
justice;
I
was
an
under-developed
writer
at
best.
Last
semester,
I
was
a
second-language
writer.
I
have
been
a
student
of
Spanish
language
for
the
better
part
of
nine
years.
I
studied
Spanish
from
seventh
grade
all
through
high
school.
When
I
got
to
Lafayette
as
a
freshman,
I
took
Advanced
Spanish,
and
then
continued
on
to
other
major
requirements
within
the
department
during
my
first
three
years
as
an
undergraduate.
I
had
hoped
to
study
abroad
in
a
Spanish-speaking
country
during
high
school,
but
that
was
not
a
possibility,
and
my
dream
was
delayed
until
college.
Finally,
on
January
10,
2006,
I
realized
my
nine-year
dream
when
I
stepped
off
the
plane
in
Madrid,
Spain.
When
you
go
to
a
new
place,
especially
on
a
long-anticipated
trip,
you
canOt
help
but
have
expectations.
Because
of
our
nature,
those
expectations
are
usually
overly-positive
with
little
consideration
for
the
challenging
aspects
of
assimilating
into
a
new
culture,
a
new
lifestyle.
I
came
to
realize
during
my
journey
(even
when
I
wasnOt
physically
traveling,
I
was
still
progressing)
that
not
all
things
about
living
in
another
country
would
be
positive.
Little
did
I
know
that
a
Spanish
diet
regularly
included
seafood
D
which
my
diet
did
not,
regularly
or
otherwise.
Little
did
I
know
that
8:00
am
is
a
regular
bedtime
after
staying
up
all
night
dancing
for
any
day
after
Tuesday,
with
little
regard
to
next-day
obligations.
But
these
issues
were
minor,
temporary,
and
avoidable.
Writing
in
Spanish
was
none
of
those
things.
My
course
load
through
the
study
abroad
program
of
St.
Lawrence
University
was
just
as
challenging
as
Lafayette,
both
work-load-
and
subject-material-wise.
And
it
was
all
in
Spanish.
Imagine
your
FYS,
VaST
or
other
writing
intensive
course,
then
multiply
the
time
it
normally
takes
to
write
for
those
classes
by
about
five.
Or
ten,
depending
on
the
assignment.
In
the
end,
the
majority
of
work
I
did
for
all
of
my
classes
was
writing,
and
it
didnOt
matter
to
my
professors
that
Spanish
was
my
second
language.
My
first
assignment:
an
on-site
interviewing
in
a
small
town
to
write
a
12-
to
15-page
guide
to
the
community.
Aside
from
the
daunting
tasks
of
living
in
a
city
with
only
two
other
Americans
and
having
to
conduct
interviews
in
disjointed
Spanish,
the
final
paper
presented
a
challenge
all
in
itself.
My
vocabulary
warehouse
was
stocked
full
of
literary
criticism,
historical
analysis
and
Latin
American
colonization
words
and
phrases,
but
the
shelves
on
Ndemographics
of
isolated
Spanish
wine-producing
townsO
were
completely
empty.
I
sat
in
my
apartment
in
Valdepeas
after
a
long
day
of
trying
to
get
the
locals
to
open
up
to
me
about
their
town
and
culture,
typing
up
not
just
responses
to
interview
questions,
but
combining
similar-themes
into
an
interesting
guide
that
would
attempt
to
reveal
the
true
character
of
the
community.
It
didnOt
go
as
smoothly
as
I
thought
it
would.
When
my
host
mother
in
Valdepeas
asked
to
proof-read
my
guide
of
her
town,
I
must
admit
that
I
was
intimidated.
Sure,
there
were
Spanish
words
filling
13
pages,
but
I
honestly
didnOt
know
if
there
were
complete
sentences
or
thoughts.
After
all,
I
had
only
been
in
the
country
for
two
weeks,
and
I
was
quickly
learning
just
how
much
I
didnOt
know.
The
moment
of
that
realization
came
when
a
nine-year-old
girl
named
Ana
told
me
that
she
knew
the
words
I
was
saying
but
that
I
Ntalked
strangely.O
I
began
to
doubt
my
own
abilities,
and
I
feared
my
host
momOs
criticism
more
so
about
my
writing
skills
than
about
the
actual
content
of
the
report.
It
felt
like
forever,
sitting
beside
my
host
mom
as
she
read
over
my
report,
correcting
rudimentary
problems
that
I
had,
especially
with
verb
and
preposition
confusion.
The
Spanish
equivalent
of
Nto
beO
is
either
NserO
or
Nestar,O
but
because
there
are
two
choices,
it
is
difficult
for
English-speakers
to
know
the
appropriate
one
to
use.
I
thought
I
knew
how
to
use
them
properly,
but
as
it
turns
out,
I
chose
the
wrong
one
most
of
the
time.
I
felt
inferior.
A
nine-year-old
could
write
better
than
I
could.
And
I
was
finally
able
to
empathize
with
the
non-native
English-speaking
students
IOve
encountered
during
my
tenure
as
a
WA.
I
made
some
basic
corrections
that
were
essentially
elementary
grammar
issues.
I
didnOt
have
the
opportunity
to
edit
for
higher-level
concerns,
since
I
basically
didnOt
know
how.
I
wouldnOt
receive
a
grade
on
that
assignment
until
the
end
of
my
semester
since
it
was
part
of
a
long-term
cultural
emersion
course
that
didnOt
meet
regularly.
So
I
plunged
right
into
the
semester
without
any
feedback
on
my
writing,
flailing
around
blindly
in
the
dark
hoping
to
encounter
some
type
of
foundation
upon
which
to
develop
my
Spanish
writing
skills.
Upon
my
arrival
in
Madrid
at
the
end
of
January
to
meet
up
with
15
other
American
students
and
to
begin
the
core
courses
of
the
semester,
I
was
immediately
immersed
in
more
classroom
writing.
My
grammar
professor
assigned
a
free-write
assignment
for
the
first
day
of
class
in
which
we
were
basically
supposed
to
expound
our
own
ideas
so
that
she
could
observe
and
critique
our
writing.
The
two-page
handwritten
paper
I
turned
in
was
the
result
of
several
hours
of
wracking
my
brain
thinking
about
how
to
not
sound
like
an
unsophisticated
child.
I
found
myself
pushing
the
limits
with
my
vocabulary
while
I
struggled
to
find
my
voice
in
another
language.
I
began
to
understand
the
frustration
of
ESL
writers,
because
sometimes
I
just
couldnOt
get
the
words
out
to
convey
exactly
what
I
meant,
even
though
the
thoughts
were
in
my
mind.
I
probably
could
have
flown
through
all
of
those
2-page
expositions
for
my
grammar
class
like
others
did
using
primary
grammar
and
simple
sentence
structure,
but
my
efforts
did
not
go
unrewarded.
Because
I
always
strived
to
push
the
envelope,
even
knowing
I
was
making
mistakes,
my
professor
was
able
to
provide
criticisms
on
my
writing
upon
which
I
began
to
build
a
my
Spanish
writing
foundation.
Several
assignments
gained
the
compliments
of
my
grammar
instructor,
which
I
took
as
high
praise
and
began
to
gain
confidence
in
my
abilities.
After
all,
my
goal
of
the
semester
was
to
come
out
fluent
in
Spanish,
and
this
was
the
only
way
to
do
it.
Through
my
five
courses,
I
would
come
to
learn
how
to
write
in
many
different
styles.
In
addition
to
the
free-writes
I
regularly
did
for
my
grammar
class,
I
also
wrote
for
NThe
History
of
Women
in
Spain,O
NEconomics
of
the
EU
and
Latin
America,O
NLandscapesO
and
NSpanish
Novels
of
the
20th
Century.O
Each
subject
area
demanded
a
different
style,
exactly
as
in
English.
While
I
was
beginning
to
feel
comfortable
and
confident
when
free-writing
for
my
grammar
class,
I
found
myself
still
searching
for
each
appropriate
voice
and
style
among
subjects.
NThe
History
of
Women
in
SpainO
was
a
history/sociology
course
for
which
I
wrote
mostly
thesis
papers
expanding
upon
historical
evidence
about
the
evolution
of
the
role
of
women
in
the
patriarchal
Spanish
society.
The
economics
course
was
technical
writing,
with
which
I
had
just
started
to
become
familiar
in
English
during
the
previous
few
semesters
on
campus.
I
found
that
type
of
technical
writing
to
be
frustrating,
and
I
learned
that
while
English
is
the
international
language
of
economics,
there
are
many
inconsistencies
that
emerge
between
countries
in
policies
and
vocabulary.
I
remember
my
first
brush
with
writing
in
the
vernacular
of
economics
during
financial
accounting
with
Professor
Rosie
Bukics
during
my
sophomore
year.
After
many
students
failed
the
first
writing
assignment
for
not
being
concise
or
quantitatively
specific,
Professor
Bukics
explained
that
in
order
to
write
successfully
for
economics,
we
first
had
to
learn
the
language
of
economics.
If
Spanish
is
my
second
language
and
Italian
my
third,
then
music
is
my
fourth
language
and
economics
my
fifth.
Combine
the
fifth
language
with
the
second
language
and
that
was
my
struggle
at
the
beginning
of
my
economics
course
in
Spanish.
However,
I
was
on
a
fast-track
to
learn
both
Nlanguages,O
and
I
found
it
progressively
easier
to
express
my
concise
ideas
supported
by
quantitative
evidence
as
a
result
of
my
constant
risk-taking
in
a
foreign
language.
Perhaps
the
criticisms
of
the
first
assignments
were
brutal,
but
in
the
long
run
my
writing
benefited
from
the
growth.
Prior
to
studying
in
Spain,
the
only
intensive
writing
I
did
in
Spanish
revolved
around
literary
analysis
and
criticism.
Since
high
school
where
I
was
in
a
college
co-op
Spanish
class,
I
had
been
reading
the
works
of
Pablo
Neruda,
Gabriel
Garca
Mrquez
and
Frederico
Garca
Lorca.
On
several
occasions,
we
utilized
the
resources
at
the
University
of
Connecticut
to
complete
extensive
literary
analyses
and
criticisms
of
these
authors
and
others,
some
of
them
resulting
in
papers
of
up
to
ten
pages
in
length.
My
teacher
had
us
attend
Spanish
plays
in
New
York
City
and
write
reviews.
In
this
genre
I
felt
most
comfortable
writing
in
Spanish
for
the
sheer
reason
that
I
had
done
it
for
so
long,
but
I
was
still
wary
of
how
a
native
Spanish
professor
would
view
my
work.
On
the
first
day
of
my
20th-Century
Spanish
Novels
course
which
was
reading-
and
writing-intensive,
five
students
attended.
The
professor
began
the
class
with
introductions,
then
by
saying,
Nsometimes
I
forget
that
I
am
speaking
to
non-native
speakers,
so
if
I
speak
too
quickly,
please
just
ask
me
to
slow
down.O
Shortly
thereafter,
she
took
off
at
lightening
speed
in
the
way
that
many
Spaniards
do
when
they
get
excited,
and
it
was
clear
that
there
would
be
no
slowing
her
down.
On
the
second
day
of
class,
three
students
returned.
With
such
individualized
attention,
I
was
both
excited
and
nervous,
and
I
knew
that
this
course
would
yield
a
heavy
work
load.
We
had
to
read
five
full-length
novels,
and
write
three
short
responses,
a
ten-page
midterm
and
a
fifteen-page
final.
The
professor
had
ample
time
to
nit-pick
each
essay,
since
there
were
only
three
of
us
in
the
class.
She
handed
back
the
first
short
response,
and
to
my
surprise
I
got
a
3.5
out
of
4.0.
Her
comments
were
constructive
but
not
as
critical
as
I
expected.
My
professor
held
individual
conferences
with
us
to
go
over
her
comments
and
it
was
obvious
that
she
honestly
cared
about
our
improvement.
For
anything
that
was
unclear
to
me,
she
would
ensure
that
I
did
not
leave
the
conference
still
confused.
Even
when
I
had
difficulties
finding
an
equivalent
Spanish
expression
to
an
English
one,
my
professor
would
listen
to
my
explanation
then
offer
her
feedback
in
a
true
dialog
about
my
writing.
Each
graded
paper
came
back
higher
than
before
D
3.6,
3.75,
3.8,
until
I
received
a
4.0
on
the
last
two
assignments.
There
was
no
better
sense
of
accomplishment
for
me
than
receiving
such
high
praise
as
a
second
language
writer.
Midway
through
the
semester,
I
was
asked
to
tutor
a
student
from
the
university,
named
Pilar,
who
wanted
to
take
The
Official
English
as
a
Foreign
Language
(TOEFL)
exam
so
that
she
could
attend
St.
Lawrence
University
in
New
York
through
the
exchange
program.
TOEFL
exams
are
similar
to
the
verbal
and
writing
sections
of
the
SAT,
but
include
tricky
questions
about
the
nuances
in
differences
between
the
languages.
Through
working
with
Pilar,
I
was
able
to
reflect
on
my
own
foreign
language
comprehension
by
seeing
things
from
the
reverse
direction.
TOEFL
exams
also
include
a
section
on
thesis
writing,
which
is
the
area
in
which
Pilar
needed
the
most
help.
I
learned
that
Spanish
students
arenOt
familiar
with
thesis-style
writing
since
they
are
taught
in
more
of
a
lecture
environment
with
one
final
exam
as
a
measure
of
comprehension.
To
most
Spanish
students,
writing
lengthy
papers
is
a
foreign
concept
in
itself,
let
alone
writing
a
thesis,
with
which
even
American
students
struggle.
Even
though
Pilar
had
a
TOEFL
book,
it
explained
the
concept
of
a
thesis
using
the
English
language,
and
the
purpose
of
a
thesis
was
so
convoluted
that
we
needed
to
start
from
the
basics.
Over
the
course
of
several
weeks,
Pilar
and
I
made
several
breakthroughs
in
thesis
writing
in
a
non-native
language,
and
my
parallel
experience
of
writing
in
Spanish
facilitated
our
discussions
and
allowed
us
to
learn
from
each
other.
Working
with
Pilar
also
helped
my
writing
improve
as
I
gained
insight
from
the
other
perspective
and
learned
the
nuances
of
translating
my
thoughts
into
phrases
that
would
make
sense
to
a
Spaniard.
In
just
one
semester
in
Spain,
I
achieved
my
goal
of
becoming
a
fluent
speaker
and
writer.
I
can
attribute
my
growth
to
risk-taking
in
a
language
not
my
own,
while
gaining
an
important
perspective
on
how
other
cultures
view
writing.
Not
only
did
my
Spanish
writing
improve,
but
my
English
did
as
well,
since
I
now
consider
how
different
people
may
comprehend
my
words
and
thoughts.
I
am
confident
that
I
will
be
a
stronger
WA
with
this
cross-cultural
understanding,
and
I
am
looking
forward
to
putting
my
experience
to
the
test
with
ESL
writers
this
fall.
