Returning
WA
August
18,
2003
Dear
New
WAs,
I
have
spent
both
semesters
of
my
sophomore
year
as
a
Writing
Associate,
learning
the
trade
and
sharpening
my
ability
to
interact
with
fellow
students
and
their
papers.
The
metamorphosis
I
underwent
as
a
WA
was
enormous,
at
least
from
my
viewpoint.
I
began
in
the
fall
a
little
uncertain
and
a
little
nervous
about
how
I
would
relate
to
the
students
and
wondered
if
I
would
be
effective
in
helping
them
with
their
papers.
But
by
the
close
of
the
spring
semester,
I
felt
very
confident
in
my
abilities.
Most
importantly,
I
felt
comfortable
in
my
conferences
with
students
because
I
had
developed
a
sort
of
routine
and
methodology
that
kept
me
organized
and
focused.
Of
course,
as
I
worked
at
becoming
a
better
WA,
I
also
experienced
changes
in
my
own
writing.
I
found
myself
butting
heads
with
my
familiar
demon,
Time.
IOve
never
had
difficulty
writing
well,
but
finding
the
time
to
do
so
became
more
and
more
difficult
as
my
sophomore
year
progressed.
Because
I
was
busy
with
classes
and
activities
and
errands
during
the
day,
I
discovered
nighttime
to
be
the
ideal
writing
time.
Only
night
accorded
me
a
considerable
duration
of
undisturbed,
quiet
time
where
I
could
think
and
write
in
peace.
The
only
problem
with
this
solution
was
that
by
nighttime,
I
was
tired
from
the
dayOs
demands
and
wanted
to
sleep
rather
than
work,
but
more
on
this
later.
My
purpose
in
writing
this
letter
is
twofold:
I
donOt
consider
myself
an
expert
WA
and
donOt
pretend
to
be
such,
yet
I
feel
I
have
learned
some
important
things
that
may
be
of
benefit
to
those
new
to
the
program.
Secondly,
I
donOt
suggest
that
anyone
should
necessarily
emulate
my
personal
writing
techniques.
I
acknowledge
that
they
are
rather
idiosyncratic
(but
whose
arenOt?)
and
certainly
eccentric,
if
not
outright
ridiculous.
But
I
put
them
down
here
because,
after
a
year,
this
is
where
my
writing
has
evolved
to
and
this
is
what
seems
to
work
for
me.
But
enough
with
introductions.
I
began
my
WA
career
in
the
fall
semester
assigned
to
an
FYS
course.
As
I
mentioned
earlier,
I
was
a
bit
uncertain
about
how
it
would
all
work
out,
but
I
just
held
my
breath
and
took
the
plunge.
Since
I
didnOt
have
any
real
peer
editing
experience,
I
let
my
own
knowledge
of
writing
and
common
sense
guide
me
through
conferences.
The
first
set
of
conferences
were
the
most
stressful
but
the
most
educational.
I
learned
quickly
what
worked
and
what
didnOt
work
and
adjusted
my
approach
accordingly.
When
I
think
back
to
the
first
few
conferences
that
I
had,
I
canOt
help
but
feel
sorry
for
those
students
who
served,
unwittingly,
as
my
guinea
pigs.
Although
I
had
the
general
idea
of
how
the
conferences
would
proceed,
actually
participating
in
them
was
another
matter.
I
sort
of
waded
through
them,
testing
the
water,
trying
different
things,
sometimes
tripping
myself
up
but
just
managing
to
keep
afloat.
Still,
the
conferences
went
well,
and
I
had
no
problems
working
with
any
of
the
students.
I
kept
in
touch
with
the
professor
of
the
class,
meeting
with
him
several
times
throughout
the
semester
to
discuss
the
next
paper
or
the
last
set
of
conferences.
Not
only
was
it
important
to
keep
him
abreast
of
what
took
place
during
the
conferences,
but
by
meeting
with
him
periodically,
I
better
understood
what
to
emphasize
when
meeting
with
the
students.
By
the
end
of
the
fall
semester,
I
felt
well
acquainted
with
the
responsibilities
of
a
WA
and
was
comfortable
performing
them;
moreover,
I
enjoyed
performing
them.
I
felt
good
knowing
that
I
was
helping
students
with
their
writing
and
I
enjoyed
meeting
and
working
with
them.
Whereas
I
had
learned
the
essentials
of
being
a
WA
in
my
fall
semester,
I
began
to
revise
and
improve
these
skills
in
the
spring
semester.
The
spring
found
me
assigned
to
a
VAST
course,
where
I
worked
with
other
sophomores
(as
opposed
to
working
with
freshman
my
fall
semester).
(Coincidentally,
there
were
two
sections
of
this
course,
so
another
WA
was
assigned
to
the
other
section.
This
was
rather
nice,
because
we
would
often
talk
about
our
conferences
and
share
advice
for
approaching
the
papers.)
I
began
to
better
formulate
a
method
for
reading
papers
and
working
with
students
in
conferences,
and
things
began
to
click
into
place.
I
became
adept
at
reading
papers
quickly
but
analytically,
picking
up
on
any
writing
problems
that
existed.
Again,
the
professor
of
the
class
aided
me
a
great
deal
by
encouraging
me
to
write
a
good
amount
of
notes/questions
on
the
papers
to
which
the
students
could
later
refer.
I
discovered
that
writing
notes
on
the
papers
was
key
to
a
successful
conference
because
it
gave
the
discussion
both
a
starting
point
and
structure.
I
also
began
to
view
the
papers
from
a
different
perspective.
In
the
fall,
I
had
focused
more
on
grammar-related
issues,
but
in
the
spring
I
learned
to
shift
my
focus
to
higher
order
concerns,
like
organization,
paragraph
cohesion,
thesis
and
thesis
development.
For
me,
this
was
a
challenge,
because
it
was
extremely
tempting
to
mark
grammar
mistakes
and
I
liked
to
closely
view
a
paper.
Yet,
I
realized
that
it
was
more
productive
and
helpful
to
view
a
paper
further
off,
and
to
address
the
larger
issues
at
play.
Overall,
I
felt
that
my
spring
semester
as
a
WA
was
highly
successful.
Conferences
went
smoothly,
and
I
felt
that
I
helped
the
students
in
some
fashion.
Any
of
my
uncertainty
from
the
fall
semester
had
completely
vanishedNI
felt
confident
and
comfortable
in
the
role
of
WA,
and
this
came
with
the
time
and
experience
of
two
semesters.
So
after
a
year
of
being
a
WA,
here
are
some
guidelines
IOve
learned
when
working
with
students
in
conferences:
1.
Smile,
smile,
smile.
ItOs
amazing
what
a
good
attitude
and
a
smiling
face
will
do!
Not
only
does
it
set
the
tone
for
the
conference,
but
it
also
puts
the
student
at
ease
knowing
that
the
conference
will
be
a
positive
experience.
2.
When
in
doubt,
write
it
out.
IOve
found
that
most
students
are
grateful
for
any
notes
or
suggestions
that
I
write
out
on
their
papers.
Not
only
is
it
helpful
when
discussing
the
paper
during
a
conference,
but
it
gives
the
student
a
record
of
what
was
discussed
when
he/she
goes
to
revise
the
paper.
And
there
is
no
such
thing
as
writing
too
much.
Be
detailed,
but
concise,
and
fully
explain
your
train
of
thought.
3.
But
if
you
write
it
out,
write
legibly.
This
should
go
without
saying,
but
IOve
had
many
students
thank
me
for
writing
neatly
and
clearly,
explaining
that
their
past
WAs
hadnOt.
If
youOre
going
to
the
trouble
to
write
notes
on
a
studentOs
paper,
make
sure
itOs
legible.
4.
Come
prepared.
Everyone
has
days
when
they
feel
theyOre
being
squeezed
through
the
meat
grinder,
but
I
always
found
it
best
to
come
to
conferences
having
read
(or
at
least
skimmed)
the
paper
and
having
notes
written
on
it
to
jog
my
memory
and
guide
the
conference.
It
helps
me
to
stay
organized
and
relaxed,
especially
when
I
have
a
long
block
of
conferences
ahead
of
me.
5.
But
if
you
donOt
have
time
to
prepareE.
There
were
a
couple
of
times
(usually
in
Drop-In)
when
I
hadnOt
read
a
paper
and
the
student
came
or
when
someone
just
wanted
a
quick
opinion
on
a
paper.
In
such
a
situation,
there
isnOt
time
to
necessarily
read
an
entire
paper,
so
an
alternate
approach
must
be
employed.
A
lot
can
be
done
by
reading
the
first
page
of
a
paper.
Major
problems,
if
any
exist,
can
usually
be
recognized
and
diagnosed
right
away,
and
such
a
conference
can
be
very
productive.
However,
I
wouldnOt
recommend
this
method
to
new
WAs.
It
takes
confidence,
quick
thinking,
and
familiarity
with
identifying
writing
issues
that
come
with
experience.
6.
What
do
you
want
to
talk
about?
Before
I
offer
any
of
my
suggestions,
I
always
ask
the
student
this
question.
The
focus
is
on
the
student
writer,
and
I
want
the
conference
to
reflect
the
studentOs
concerns,
more
so
than
my
own.
The
student
knows
his/her
strengths
and
weaknesses
and
what
he/she
wants
to
achieve
with
the
paper.
This
gives
the
student
control
over
the
conference
and
helps
to
get
him/her
talking
about
the
paper.
I
donOt
want
the
student
to
see
me
as
a
teacher
or
someone
whose
job
it
is
to
point
out
his/her
mistakes,
but
rather
as
a
fellow
student
whoOll
listen
and
share
advice.
7.
Save
time.
I
used
to
allot
5
minutes
in
between
each
conference
when
I
had
several
in
a
row.
However,
very
few
conferences
run
30
minutes
long.
Most
last
about
10-15
minutes,
so
I
found
I
was
able
to
schedule
conferences
directly
back
to
back
without
a
problem.
When
I
had
a
block
of
5
or
6
conferences
in
a
row,
this
was
a
big
time-saver.
8.
Body
language
says
it
all.
As
a
WA,
I
prepared
for
each
conference
and
began
each
with
the
same
upbeat
and
courteous
attitude.
But
sometimes,
a
student
is
simply
in
no
mood
to
be
in
a
conference.
ItOs
easy
to
pick
up
on
this,
and
in
such
a
situation,
itOs
wise
to
keep
the
conference
as
short
and
sweet
as
possible,
so
to
avoid
wandering
eyes,
vacant
stares,
and
impatient
fidgeting.
The
student
will
appreciate
this,
and
you
will
too!
In
terms
of
my
own
writing,
being
a
WA
has
made
me
a
more
critical
and
analytical
writer.
I
am
more
aware
of
various
writing
problems
and
I
can
identify
them
and
correct
them
in
my
own
writing
more
readily.
But
the
biggest
changes
that
my
writing
underwent
this
past
year
had
not
so
much
to
do
with
being
a
WA
as
with
being
a
student
trying
to
find
herself
as
a
writer.
As
I
already
mentioned,
I
have
never
found
writing
difficult
and
I
always
took
pride
in
my
ability
to
write
well.
However,
the
thing
that
I
found
most
difficult
was
beginning.
I
suppose
IOm
what
one
might
call
a
temperamental
writerNI
have
to
be
Nin
the
moodO
to
write,
or
I
canOt
bring
myself
to
do
it.
For
me,
writing
is
an
experience
much
akin
to
painting
or
drawing
(IOm
an
artist):
once
I
actually
begin,
some
strange
power
takes
over
and
propels
me
through
my
work,
and
IOm
scarcely
conscious
of
what
IOm
doing.
ItOs
almost
as
if
the
paper
writes
itself,
it
all
happens
so
quickly
and
effortlessly.
Yet
the
problem
with
this
is
that
when
I
have
deadlines
and
due
dates
to
adhere
to,
I
donOt
have
the
luxury
of
timeNwhether
IOm
in
the
mood
or
not,
there
comes
a
point
where
I
have
to
write
the
paper
and
get
it
done.
And
this
was
the
hard
partNhow
do
I
get
in
the
mood?
I
had
always
held
the
conceit
that
as
soon
as
a
paper
was
assigned,
I
must
begin
it
once
my
immediate
homework
was
completed.
My
goal
was
to
finish
my
schoolwork
early,
so
that
it
would
be
done
and
I
could
relax.
And
so
I
acted
accordingly.
I
more
or
less
stuck
to
this
because
I
hated
late
nights
with
little
sleep.
I
liked
to
write
out
my
papers
by
hand
one
day
and
then
type
and
revise
them
the
next,
and
I
liked
to
reserve
this
work
for
the
weekend
when
I
could
lock
myself
in
my
room
and
work
undisturbed.
I
had
devised
this
method
in
high
school
and
it
had
worked
well
for
me
ever
since,
but
I
was
slowly
realizing
that
it
wasnOt
as
practical
as
it
once
was.
Other
homework
or
obligations
over
the
weekend
impeded
my
work
and
I
often
could
not
dedicate
myself
entirely
to
my
paper,
as
I
would
like.
The
first
change
to
occur
was
that
I
began
to
write
on
weekdays.
This
may
sound
odd,
but
I
purposely
saved
my
writing
assignments
for
the
weekend
when
I
wouldnOt
be
harried
by
classes
or
tired
from
them.
Breaking
myself
of
this
habit
was
awkward;
I
was
loath
to
break
it
and
had
resisted
breaking
it
for
some
time.
Like
I
said,
I
could
only
write
when
I
was
in
the
mood,
and
I
was
accustomed
to
writing
only
on
weekends.
So
to
write
on
weekdays,
I
had
to
retrain
myself,
so
to
speak.
The
second
change
was
a
natural
result
of
the
first.
Because
I
couldnOt
just
write
on
the
weekend,
I
had
to
write
during
weekdays,
and
the
only
length
of
quiet
time
that
existed
during
a
weekday
was
at
night.
I
was
used
to
writing
during
the
day,
but
I
slowly
became
comfortable
writing
at
night,
late
into
the
morning
hours.
It
was
here
that
I
became
acquainted
with
another
demon,
Caffeine.
With
a
cup
of
coffee,
IOd
make
myself
comfortable
on
my
bed,
in
my
pajamas,
and
write
my
papers,
and
I
was
quite
content
and
productive.
By
the
end
of
the
fall
semester,
the
metamorphosis
was
almost
complete.
I
was
comfortable
writing
at
any
time
of
the
day,
just
so
long
as
I
had
a
cup
of
coffee
by
my
side
to
stimulate
my
writerOs
brain.
I
also
began
to
compose
my
papers
directly
on
the
computer;
for
some
reason,
my
creativity
flourished
through
my
typing
fingers.
Yet
as
the
spring
semester
commenced,
I
found
that
coffee
wasnOt
enough
to
aid
me
in
my
writing
endeavorsNI
needed
something
else
to
keep
me
focused
and
in
the
mood
to
write.
So
I
brainstormed.
My
first
thought
was
location.
Perhaps
IOd
write
better
in
a
different
location,
so
I
tried
writing
in
the
lounge
one
night.
The
change
of
location
did
help
a
little,
and
I
finished
my
paper,
but
I
still
preferred
the
confines
of
my
roomNI
just
felt
more
comfortable
there.
Then
another
thought
came
to
me:
often,
when
IOm
painting,
I
have
the
radio
playing
because
it
keeps
me
focused
somehow;
maybe
this
would
work
when
I
wrote
too,
I
thought.
So
I
tried
it,
and
the
result
was
an
astounding
success.
I
distinctly
recall
the
last
paper
I
wrote
for
the
spring
semester.
It
was
around
ten
oOclock
at
night,
and
I
was
sitting
at
my
computer
in
my
room.
I
had
just
finished
my
hazelnut
coffee,
and
I
was
singing
along
to
my
favorite
CD
as
I
wrote
my
paper.
As
silly
as
this
image
must
seem,
I
was
very
focused
and
I
finished
my
10-page
paper
within
six
hours.
When
I
had
finished,
I
remember
feeling
exhilarated
from
my
effort
and
proud
of
what
I
had
written.
The
most
important
thing
that
I
learned
about
myself
as
writer
was
that
itOs
paramount
that
IOm
comfortable
when
I
write.
And
IOm
most
comfortable
when
IOm
in
my
room,
drinking
coffee
and
listening
to
music.
It
took
me
two
semesters
to
come
to
these
realizations,
and
IOm
glad
that
I
came
to
them
because
they
make
writing
so
much
easier
for
me.
Overall,
I
feel
that
I
learned
a
lot
about
myself
as
a
writer
this
past
year,
and
that
I
am
now
a
more
flexible
writer.
Although
it
is
still
a
bit
of
a
challenge
piecing
together
the
time
to
write,
I
now
know
that
when
I
do
have
that
spare
bit
of
time,
I
can
sit
down
and
write
and
be
productive.
My
advice
to
other
student
writers
is
that
they
should
try
to
find
out
what
makes
them
comfortable
and
then
embrace
that
when
they
sit
down
to
write.
For
some
people,
having
music
playing
could
be
a
distraction,
as
could
drinking
too
much
coffee,
but
thatOs
what
worked
for
me.
It
takes
some
experimenting
and
some
time
to
figure
it
out,
so
donOt
be
afraid
to
try
different
things
and
donOt
get
discouragedNyouOll
eventually
stumble
upon
it.
In
terms
of
finding
the
time
to
write,
I
try
to
get
my
more
quickly-completed
homework
done
during
the
day
so
that
I
can
dedicate
my
night
to
writing.
It
helps
when
you
know
what
time
of
day
youOre
most
comfortable
writing,
and
then
to
make
sure
to
reserve
that
time
for
writing.
IOm
grateful
for
all
that
IOve
learned
this
past
year,
both
as
a
writer
and
as
a
WA,
because
I
know
it
will
make
this
coming
year
that
much
easier!
Hopefully,
some
of
my
advice
will
be
helpful
or
at
least
interesting,
as
you
embark
on
your
WA
careers
and
continue
your
writing
careers!
Good
luck
with
the
semester!
Sincerely,
