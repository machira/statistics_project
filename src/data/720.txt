When
I
add
up
my
experience
after
completing
my
second
year
as
a
writing
associate
(WA),
I
can
calculate
that
IOve
helped
roughly
72
students
(18
per
semester)
four
times
apiece.
That
said,
if
I
felt
that
after
288
WA
conferences
that
I
had
not
changed
as
both
a
writer
and
a
writing
associate,
I
think
I
would
have
wasted
my
time.
Fortunately,
my
experience
has
been
quite
the
opposite
and
I
have
changed
both
my
own
writing
and
my
approach
to
WA
conferences
as
a
result
of
the
time
I
have
spent
with
the
College
Writing
Program.
I
have
discovered
that
writing
is
a
talent,
just
as
baseball
or
music,
and
not
just
a
skill.
Writing
is
something
I
have
come
to
embrace,
and
like
other
talents
I
see
myself
as
having,
I
have
altered
my
techniques
and
skill
sets
to
improve.
So
how
does
working
for
the
College
Writing
Program
fit
into
the
transformation
of
my
writing?
Well
I
think
that
spending
such
a
significant
amount
of
time
in
conferences
about
studentsO
writing
as
well
as
attending
staff
meetings,
when
combined
with
the
rigorous
amount
of
writing
in
my
own
coursework,
does
not
allow
me
to
escape
writing.
Being
a
WA
has
forced
writing
to
be
a
constant
part
of
my
life,
just
like
eating
is.
And,
unbeknown
to
me,
I
have
learned
to
enjoy
writing
much
more
than
I
like
most
other
academic
activities.
When
reflecting
back
on
the
last
year
as
a
WA,
it
is
hard
to
forget
about
the
two
classes
I
was
assigned
to
and
the
professors
I
worked
with.
My
third
semester
as
a
WA
was
in
Professor
TiernanOs
FYS
on
war
in
the
nineteenth
century
last
fall.
Even
though
I
had
no
past
experiences
with
Professor
Tiernan
and
minimal
exposure
in
college
to
World
War
I
or
II,
I
approached
the
assignment
with
an
open
mind.
The
major
obstacle
I
faced
right
away
with
Professor
TiernanOs
class
was
contacting
the
instructor
to
set
up
times
to
meet
with
him
and
visit
the
class.
Similar
to
my
first
WA
class
the
year
before,
phone
calls
and
e-mails
were
oftentimes
not
enough
during
the
semester.
This
time,
my
partner
professor
was
oftentimes
not
in
his
office
during
office
hours
and
thus
visiting
the
weekly
class
became
my
way
of
keeping
up
with
assignments
and
conferences.
Aside
from
the
communication
difficulties,
this
FYS
proved
to
be
an
enjoyable
class
for
me
due
to
the
content
of
the
course.
For
each
of
the
four
assignments,
each
student
was
given
a
different
topic
to
write
about
and
this
made
the
processes
of
reading
the
papers
and
discussing
them
with
the
writers
much
more
enjoyable.
Although
I
never
imagined
at
the
beginning
of
the
course
I
would
eventually
say
this,
Professor
TiernanOs
class
is
one
that
I
would
actually
not
mind
having
again.
As
second-year
WA,
I
feel
as
if
I
did
lend
a
hand
to
new
WAs
who
were
unsure
at
times
about
situations
they
were
in
during
the
year.
In
relation
to
my
assignment
in
Professor
TiernanOs
FYS,
I
advised
new
WAs
to
avoid
prejudging
their
partner
professors
or
the
class
they
are
assigned
and
instead
look
to
the
bright
points
of
the
class
such
as
cooperative
students
and
interesting
course
content.
Not
giving
the
professor
or
class
a
fair
chance
is
something
I
definitely
did
as
a
first-semester
WA
and
should
not
have.
I
have
also
encouraged
new
WAs,
and
will
continue
to
do
so,
not
to
listen
to
the
preconceived
notions
their
peers,
and
particularly
veteran
WAs,
have
about
certain
professors.
To
that
end,
I
would
warn
new
WAs
also
against
judging
the
book,
or
professor,
by
its
cover.
The
spring
semester
presented
a
much
more
optimal
assignment
as
I
worked
with
sophomores
enrolled
in
Professor
SmithOs
VAST
centered
around
the
ethics
of
gambling
and
the
applicable
laws
and
regulations
in
states
including
Pennsylvania.
One
of
the
primary
reasons
it
was
much
easier
to
work
with
this
class
was
their
level
of
interest
in
it.
Although
I
had
never
worked
with
or
even
met
Professor
Smith
before
meeting
him
for
the
first
time
to
discuss
the
class
schedule,
we
got
along
very
well
and
it
was
easy
to
understand
why
his
students
thought
so
much
of
him.
His
assignments
were
straightforward
and
he
was
easily
able
to
communicate
to
me
the
schedule
for
conferences
that
he
had
already
created
and
had
placed
on
the
course
syllabus.
This
allowed
me
to
be
on
the
same
page
with
the
student
writers
and
thus
made
for
much
more
effective
conferences.
Working
with
Professor
SmithOs
class
also
led
me
to
realize
that
a
lot
of
students
perform
better
when
in
a
classroom
environment
that
they
enjoy.
With
the
students
I
worked
with
last
semester,
it
became
evident
that
they
looked
forward
to
attending
this
particular
VAST
and
in
response
their
writing
was
full
of
passion
and
interesting
to
read.
I
donOt
believe
that
these
18
students
were
brighter
or
better
writers
coming
into
the
semester
than
the
students
I
had
in
the
VAST
I
worked
with
in
the
Spring
of
2010,
but
they
certainly
took
more
out
of
the
class
and
their
writing
improved
more
in
one
semester
than
any
class
I
had
worked
with
in
the
past.
I
should
also
mention
that
I
believe
that
having
three
semestersO
worth
of
experience
going
into
last
semester
must
have
had
some
impact
on
the
studentsO
improvement
during
the
class.
IOm
not
claiming
to
be
a
god
of
writing
but
it
makes
sense
that
I
would
be
able
to
help
students
more
after
having
bountiful
experience
in
similar
situations.
To
that
extent,
I
think
the
College
Writing
Program
might
benefit
from
a
NWA-shadowingO
training
program
in
which
new
WAs
would
have
to
sit
in
on
real
conferences
that
veteran
WAs
conduct
during
their
first
semester.
Looking
back
on
my
first
WA
assignment,
I
realize
that
the
only
real
conference
I
had
was
as
an
FYS
student
with
no
inclination
that
I
would
eventually
be
in
the
other
role.
Therefore,
I
think
new
WAs
would
be
able
to
help
their
students
more
if
they
had
to
watch
ten
to
twenty
conferences
with
people
who
have
at
least
two
semesters
of
experience
conducting
WA
conferences.
While
on
the
topic
of
WA
conferences,
it
should
be
noted
that
I
have
discovered
over
the
last
two
years
the
several
different
ways
conferences
can
take
shape.
First,
there
is
the
conference
which
every
WA
dreams
of
D
the
Nperfect
conference.O
To
be
such
a
meeting,
a
few
things
must
fall
into
place.
First,
the
student
must
not
only
shows
up
on
time
but
they
must
be
prepared
for
the
conference.
This
means
that
either
the
WA
has
received
the
studentOs
paper
beforehand
and
in
plenty
of
time,
or
if
the
ProfessorOs
policy,
the
student
brings
the
material
to
be
conferenced
on
to
the
meeting.
Second,
the
student
must
be
cooperative
during
the
meeting.
This
entails
not
only
be
willing
to
listen
to
the
WA
but
more
importantly
be
willing
to
communicate
their
thoughts
to
them,
without
which
the
facilitative
approach
cannot
work.
Lastly,
in
order
for
a
perfect
conference
to
take
place,
the
student
must
leave
the
conference
having
a
very
thorough
understanding
of
what
he
or
she
needs
to
do
to
improve
the
paper.
And
this
understanding
must
be
reached
through
a
relevant
discussion
that
takes
place
between
the
WA
and
student.
In
other
words,
if
the
WA
simply
tells
the
student
what
to
do
with
their
paper
the
conference
has
not
been
a
perfect
one.
Having
a
perfect
conference,
or
even
better
having
many
in
a
single
round
of
conferences,
is
the
most
rewarding
experience
a
WA
can
have.
Knowing
that
youOve
truly
made
the
difference
in
your
job
and
also
knowing
that
the
student(s)
appreciate(s)
that
you
have
helped
them
is
the
largest
feeling
of
success
that
comes
with
the
job
of
being
a
WA.
And
while
perfect
conferences
may
be
a
rarity,
they
have
become
much
more
frequent
occurrence
as
I
have
had
more
experiences
in
the
position.
The
next
type
of
conference,
letOs
call
it
the
Nmediocre
conference,O
isnOt
as
clear
cut
or
easily
defined.
And
it
should
also
be
mentioned
that
there
could
be
any
number
of
intervals
in
between
the
types
of
conferences
that
I
am
writing
about.
The
mediocre
conference,
in
general,
is
one
in
which
the
student
shows
up
but
the
conference
does
not
fully
accomplish
what
it
is
meant
to.
It
could
be
that
the
student
only
brings
an
outline
to
the
conference
when
they
were
supposed
to
e-mail
the
WA
a
five
page
paper
almost
a
week
ago.
And
although
they
are
eager
to
listen
to
advice,
the
WA
is
hard
pressed
to
help
the
person
because
they
have
not
completed
the
assignment.
Another
example
of
a
mediocre
conference
would
be
one
in
which
the
regular
assignment
was
received
in
time
but
the
student
does
not
communicate
effectively
with
the
WA
and
thus
the
optimal
conference
outcome
is
impossible
to
reach.
Obviously,
the
mediocre
conference
can
take
many
forms
but
must
hold
to
the
basic
qualification
that
the
meetingOs
potential
was
not
fully
reached
due
to
one
or
more
circumstances.
Finally,
some
conferences
take
the
shape
of
a
Nfailed
conference.O
Though
something
that
all
WAs
try
to
avoid,
when
the
student
either
does
not
show
up
at
all
or
pretends
to
be
mute
for
the
entire
meeting
it
can
be
hard
to
avoid
a
failed
conference.
This
is
one
in
which
nothing
at
all
gets
accomplished
within
the
30
minute
time
frame.
It
should
be
noted
that
even
if
a
student
shows
up
to
the
conference
with
no
part
of
the
assignment
done,
the
conference
does
not
necessarily
have
to
be
a
failed
conference.
If
a
WA
is
still
able
to
really
help
the
student
understand
the
assignment
and
what
they
need
to
do
to
and
the
student
can
then
go
on
and
write
a
successful
paper,
the
conference
may
actually
be
a
high-end
mediocre
conference.
For
an
experienced
WA,
a
failed
conference
should
only
occur
when
the
student
fails
to
show
up
at
all
because
they
will
have
learned
things
both
in
their
experience
in
conferences
and
in
staff
meetings
to
help
them
avoid
failed
conferences.
For
the
new
WA
however,
avoiding
failed
conferences
is
another
skill
of
being
a
WA
that
shadowing
experienced
WAs
for
a
semester
could
help
them
to
build.
In
order
to
get
them
up
to
speed,
I
think
it
is
very
important
to
let
new
WAs
know
the
situations
that
they
are
going
to
encounter
in
their
conferences.
This
is
also
important
because
it
is
hard
to
avoid
being
discouraged
at
many
times
as
a
new
WA
and
knowing
what
to
expect
in
advance
will
make
them
feel
better.
First
of
all,
they
should
know
that
students
will
miss
conferences
and
that
there
is
relatively
little
a
WA
can
do
to
avoid
this
after
providing
the
class
with
their
contact
information.
New
WAs
should
also
know
to
expect
students
to
come
to
conferences
that
do
not
care
at
all
about
what
their
WA
has
to
say
and
this,
along
with
students
missing
conferences,
is
what
can
lead
to
the
dreaded
failed
conference.
I
also
mentioned
that
being
a
WA
has
helped
to
improve
my
own
writing
in
the
past
year.
As
an
American
Studies
major,
writing
is
the
most
prominent
element
of
my
curriculum
and
writing
major
term
papers
as
opposed
to
taking
final
exams
is
standard
instead
of
abnormal.
Helping
other
people
with
their
writing
after
reading
what
they
wrote
helps
me
by
allowing
my
mind
to
recognize
problems
in
my
studentsO
papers
that
are
oftentimes
also
evident
in
my
own
work.
There
have
been
several
times
that
I
am
reading
a
studentOs
paper
and
I
realize
that
my
paper
lacks
the
same
element
of
an
assignment
that
one
of
my
own
papers
that
I
happen
to
be
working
on
is
in
need
of.
I
am
also
able
to
ask
students
to
explain
the
decisions
they
made
in
their
papers
and
this
often
enlightens
me
as
to
what
can
improve
my
own
papers.
Additionally,
reading
and
discussing
staff
meeting
assignments
allow
me
to
reflect
on
how
I
can
improve
my
own
writing.
Analyzing
the
pros
and
cons
of
Paper
A
versus
Paper
B,
even
when
doing
for
the
umpteenth
time
gives
WAs
the
opportunity
to
think
through
what
makes
a
good
paper.
Other
readings
encourage
me
to
think
about
aspects
of
writing
prompts
and
individual
writing
exercises.
And
importantly,
discussing
writing
with
others
who
excel
at
it
gives
WAs
the
opportunity
to
hear
what
other
people
have
done
in
their
experiences
both
with
their
studentsO
writing
and
their
own.
So
there
you
have
it.
As
an
experienced
WA,
IOve
realized
that
as
I
have
more
and
more
conferences
with
students
I
am
able
to
help
students
improve
more
and
more
while
also
boosting
my
own
writing
skills.
And
while
not
all
classes
will
have
the
benefit
of
having
an
experienced
WA,
there
are
steps
that
could
be
taken
such
as
a
WA
shadowing
program
that
could
help
get
new
WAs
up
to
speed
and
allow
them
to
develop
their
skill
sets
more
quickly.
This
would
prevent
many
failed
conferences
and
help
first
and
second-year
students
who
need
to
make
large
strides
in
their
writing
in
order
to
succeed
at
writing
at
the
collegiate
level.
