Writing
Like
a
WA
Before
retrieving
my
first
set
of
WA
papers
from
my
mailbox
in
Pardee
310,1
had
no
idea
what
to
expect.
Because
I
tend
to
doubt
my
capabilities
in
most
circumstances,
my
greatest
fear
was
that
the
students
would
all
write
stellar
papers
far
above
the
level
of
my
own
writing.
I
was
deeply
concerned
with
proving
myself'
to
the
students,
and
I
wanted
to
give
them
reasons
to
respect
my
knowledge
and
seriously
consider
my
advice.
When
I
actually
picked
up
the
papers
and
began
to
delve
into
them,
I
discovered
that
my
fears
were
completely
off
track.
I
found
myself
faced
with
a
completely
different
but
still
daunting
problem:
I
felt
most
of
the
papers
had
so
many
major
flaws
that
I
didn't
know
where
to
begin.
Some
of
the
students
had
completely
misinterpreted
the
assignment,
according
to
my
understanding
of
it.
Many
of
them
had
also
glossed
over
the
fact
that
their
paper
should
have
a
thesis.
The
students
who
had
bothered
to
include
theses
had
stuck
them
awkwardly
in
the
middle
of
the
introductory
paragraph
and
then
never
thought
about
them
again.
There
were
only
about
two
or
three
papers
that
I
felt
were
headed
in
the
right
direction.
Once
again
I
began
to
doubt
myself.
I
couldn't
imagine
how
the
majority
of
the
papers
could
be
so
off
base.
I
frantically
tried
to
call
Rachel
Pilling,
a
friend
of
mine
who
had
previously
WA-ed
for
the
same
professor.
But
Rachel
wasn't
in
her
room,
so
I
flopped
back
down
on
my
beanbag
to
try
to
sort
things
out
on
my
own.
After
reading
through
the
papers
a
second
time,
I
decided
that
my
initial
assessment
of
them
had
been
more
or
less
correct,
and
I
focused
on
conjuring
up
nice,
friendly,
encouraging
ways
to
tell
people
to
scrap
most
of
what
they
had
written
and
try
again.
Thus,
the
majority
of
my
first
conferences
consisted
in
helping
the
students
devise
a
working
thesis
or
helping
them
find
ways
to
support
the
thesis
they
had
already
invented.
In
doing
so,
I
quickly
became
aware
of
my
limitations
as
a
WA.
Many
of
the
students
had
no
idea
how
to
go
about
finding
a
thesis.
They
hadn't
done
(and
most
didn't
seem
willing
to
do)
the
amount
of
research
necessary
to
formulate
their
own
unique
interpretation
of
the
information.
They
had
never
learned
to
think
critically,
synthesizing
information
and
developing
a
new
way
of
looking
at
it.
These
aren't
skills
that
can
be
taught
in
one
half-hour
conference.
Many
of
the
students
really
needed
someone
to
sit
next
to
them
and
guide
them
through
the
whole
writing
process,
as
my
mother
did
with
me
in
fifth
grade.
I
gingerly
made
my
way
through
that
difficult
first
set
of
conferences,
and
I
didn't
even
have
to
clean
egg
yolks
off
my
windows
the
following
day.
Quite
the
contrary,
I
felt
that
most
of
the
students
had
been
very
open,
attentive,
and
respectful.
Although
they
certainly
weren't
looking
forward
to
re-working
their
papers,
most
of
them
could
see
why
an
overhaul
was
necessary,
and
many
even
expressed
gratitude
for
my
help.
As
the
students
met
with
me
for
their
second,
third,
and
fourth
conferences,
I
was
thrilled
to
watch
them
correct
problems
we
had
spoken
about
previously.
However,
I
found
it
disheartening
when
a
student
had
fixed
the
problem
discussed
at
the
previous
conference,
only
to
commit
a
new
major
error
that
once
again
necessitated
rewriting
most
of
what
he
or
she
had
done.
I
wanted
the
students
to
see
the
success
they
had
achieved
in
fixing
the
old
problem,
but
they
often
could
only
focus
on
the
fact
that
they
needed
to
start
from
scratch
once
again.
There
was
one
fairly
common
progression
of
errors"
that
I
saw
in
several
of
my
students.
This
typical
progression
began
with
a
student
who
didn't
understand
the
concept
of
presenting
a
thesis
early
in
the
paper
and
then
using
the
remainder
of
the
paper
to
support
the
thesis.
When
this
typical
student
grasped
the
idea
of
a
thesis,
his
next
mistake
was
often
to
create
a
thesis
that
could
be
easily
supported
but
didn't
involve
much
critical
thinking.
The
third
paper
in
this
little
progression
would
often
contain
a
more
comprehensive
thesis,
but
the
support
was
confusing
or
unconvincing.
At
first
I
couldn't
understand
why
these
mistakes
hadn't
been
sifted
out
years
ago.
However,
that
was
a
good
reminder
for
me
of
the
fact
each
student
has
a
unique
writing
history.
I
wasn't
able
to
continue
my
WA
work
at
Lafayette
last
semester
because
I
spent
the
semester
in
Belgium.
However,
I
did
help
out
a
bit
in
the
writing
center
at
Vesalius
College,
the
institution
where
I
studied.
Vesalius
was
an
American
style
school
with
all
classes
taught
in
English;
however
it
was
a
very
international
college,
and
the
vast
majority
of
the
students
had
learned
English
as
their
second
or
third
language.
Working
in
the
Vesalius
writing
center,
I
found
myself
faced
with
the
same
difficult
problems
I
had
encountered
at
Lafayette,
but
now
with
the
added
challenge
of
assisting
students
who
couldn't
necessarily
write
English
fluently.
Even
before
I
was
trained
as
a
Writing
Associate
at
Lafayette,
I
understood
the
need
to
first
help
writers
discover
the
flaws
in
their
papers
and
then
provide
minimal
guidance
as
they
devise
their
own
solutions
to
the
problems.
There
were
many
instances
in
my
work
at
Vesalius
in
which
this
technique
simply
did
not
work.
For
example,
I
would
come
across
a
sentence
that
was
worded
awkwardly,
and
I
would
point
this
out
to
the
student.
Often
the
student
could
not
even
see
what
was
wrong
with
the
sentence
because
it
didn't
sound
wrong
to
him.
When
I
encouraged
him
to
correct
the
sentence
on
his
own,
the
student
would
usually
formulate
another
sentence
that
was
worded
just
as
awkwardly.
I
found
myself
rewording
sentences
for
the
students
so
we
wouldn't
sit
staring
at
the
same
sentence
for
an
hour.
I
never
did
remedy
this
problem,
and
I'm
not
sure
that
a
quick
solution
exists.
I
believe
that
reading
is
such
an
instrumental
tool
for
improving
one's
writing.
If
we
don't
constantly
expose
ourselves
to
higher
levels
of
writing,
our
own
writing
will
never
improve.
I
felt
that
most
of
the
students
at
Vesalius
needed
to
do
more
reading
in
English
before
they
would
be
able
to
recognize
quality
writing
and
understand
how
to
make
their
own
writing
approach
that
level.
I
believe
the
same
is
true
for
many
Lafayette
College
students,
myself
included.
Reflecting
on
how
these
two
WA
experiences
have
affected
my
own
writing,
I
thought
of
two
specific
ways
my
job
as
a
WA
has
improved
the
way
I
write.
First,
my
interactions
with
my
FYS
students
during
the
first
semester
helped
me
to
realize
the
power
and
efficiency
of
a
thesis
paper
that
is
well
organized
and
well
structured.
A
couple
of
my
students
wrote
papers
that
were
like
collections
of
amazing
artifacts
haphazardly
thrown
in
a
display
case
by
the
museum
curator.
These
papers
contained
excellent
theses
and
advanced
ideas,
but
their
brilliance
was
hidden
in
the
disorganization
of
the
paper.
During
a
conference
with
one
of
these
students,
the
student
and
I
would
reorganize
the
paper
so
that
the
supporting
ideas
were
separated
from
one
another,
yet
clearly
linked
together.
We
made
sure
that
each
idea
was
clearly
supportive
of
the
thesis.
When
these
students'
papers
were
properly
organized
to
display
their
ideas,
the
reader
could
easily
see
the
their
ingenuity.
Recognizing
that
structure
can
either
greatly
interfere
with
a
paper
or
showcase
its
brilliance,
I
have
tried
to
focus
on
the
organization
of
my
own
papers.
I
have
found
however,
that
such
lack
of
clarity
is
difficult
to
recognize
in
one's
own
writing.
This
leads
me
to
the
second
major
lesson
that
being
a
WA
has
taught
me:
the
value
of
a
second
opinion.
I
have
always
been
hesitant
to
share
my
writing
with
others.
A
major
reason
for
this
is
the
fact
that
I
have
difficulty
judging
the
quality
of
my
own
writing.
When
I
hand
someone
a
paper
of
mine
to
read,
I
usually
preface
it
with
a
comment
like,
Yeah,
this
is
one
of
the
worst
papers
I
have
ever
written.
If
I
think
the
paper
has
some
redeeming
qualities,
I
might
tone
my
comment
down
a
little
and
just
say,
This
paper
isn't
really
that
great,
but
do
you
think
you
could
read
it
for
me?
Only
after
an
esteemed
reader
has
praised
a
work
I
have
written
do
I
gladly
give
the
piece
to
others
to
read.
Even
though
I
don't
normally
have
a
high
opinion
of
my
writing,
I
almost
always
have
difficulty
accepting
criticism
of
it.
When
I
write,
I
usually
put
a
great
deal
of
time
into
the
paper,
mulling
over
it
and
perfecting
each
sentence
to
the
best
of
my
ability.
As
I
spend
more
and
more
time
on
a
paper,
it
becomes
very
much
an
extension
of
myself,
reflecting
my
best
ideas
and
my
best
writing.
Thus,
I
often
take
criticism
of
my
papers
the
same
way
I
take
criticism
of
myself:
not
very
well.
My
response
to
criticism
is
usually
to
become
very
embarrassed,
giggle
a
little
to
hide
my
embarrassment,
and
withdraw
from
the
person
criticizing
me.
This
is
of
course
very
counterproductive
in
the
case
of
my
writing,
since
most
people
who
criticize
something
I've
written
are
doing
so
constructively,
with
the
intention
of
helping
me
improve.
Yet
I
am
learning
how
to
smother
my
pride
and
humbly
request
and
consider
the
suggestions
of
others.
I
have
found
others'
opinions
to
be
indispensable
tools
in
my
efforts
to
eliminate
two
of
my
major
writing
flaws:
my
wordiness
and
my
inclusion
of
useless
facts
that
are
fantastically
interesting
to
me
but
completely
irrelevant
to
the
paper.
Although
I
specifically
noticed
these
two
results
of
my
WA
experience,
being
a
WA
has
brought
about
other
changes
in
my
writing
that
have
been
more
gradual
and
less
apparent.
And
my
WA
experience
certainly
isn't
the
only
factor
that
has
contributed
to
my
growth
as
a
writer
over
the
past
year.
The
improvement
has
been
aided
by
a
variety
of
factors,
including
conversations
with
people,
books
I
have
read,
and
especially
my
own
attempts
at
writing.
This
past
semester,
I
completed
my
most
enjoyable
research
paper
thus
far.
My
topic
was
Rembrandt
Van
Rijn,
the
great
Dutch
painter,
etcher,
and
draughtsman.
I
believe
that
one
of
the
reasons
I
enjoyed
this
project
so
much
was
the
fact
that
I
had
ample
time
to
research
my
topic.
Being
a
frustrated
perfectionist
,
I
have
a
compulsive
desire
to
know
everything
there
is
to
know
about
a
topic
before
I
start
writing.
If
I
can't
do
the
paper
perfectly
and
completely,
I
don't
want
to
do
it
at
all.
I
also
find
that
the
more
I
research
a
subject,
the
more
it
interests
and
intrigues
me.
This
has
held
true
even
for
topics
that
initially
don't
fascinate
me
in
the
least.
I
have
come
to
believe
that
my
lack
of
interest
in
many
areas
of
study
actually
lies
in
the
fact
that
I
just
don't
know
enough
about
them
to
understand
them.
This
leads
me
to
wonder
if
the
same
is
true
for
the
students
I
work
with
in
the
writing
center.
Understanding
people
is
so
intriguing
to
me,
and
I
get
very
excited
when
writing
helps
me
learn
something
new
about
myself
or
other
people.
In
doing
my
Rembrandt
paper,
I
recognized
how
two
facets
of
my
personality
affected
my
writing.
First,
I
noticed
my
compelling
desire
to
categorize.
I
wanted
to
put
Rembrandt
into
a
category
of
people
with
which
I
was
familiar
so
that
he
would
be
more
real
and
understandable
to
me.
I
understood
and
appreciated
the
tenderness
and
love
that
was
so
apparent
in
Rembrandt's
paintings
of
his
wife.
However,
I
couldn't
comprehend
how
such
man
could
also
be
disrespectful
and
uncompromising
in
his
dealings
with
patrons.
I
caught
myself
conveniently
disregarding
the
aspects
of
Rembrandt's
character
that
didn't
fit
into
the
box
I
had
squeezed
him
into.
Somewhat
linked
to
my
desire
to
categorize
is
a
second
aspect
of
my
essence,
which
is
my
tendency
to
idealize.
I
often
allow
my
optimism
and
idealism
to
twist
the
facts
I
am
reading
into
what
I
would
like
them
to
be.
For
example,
I
wanted
Rembrandt
to
be
a
man
who
truly
loved
his
God
and
did
his
artwork
with
the
genuine
intention
of
bringing
glory
to
his
creator.
Rembrandt
was
a
Christian,
but
his
devotion
probably
didn't
go
as
far
as
I
wanted
to
believe.
Another
of
my
formative
writing
experiences
during
the
past
year
was
a
less
formal
one:
the
e-mails
I
wrote
to
the
States
about
my
traipsing
through
Europe.
Because
I
had
left
so
many
friends
and
family
members
at
home,
I
had
to
resort
to
mass
e-mails
to
keep
in
touch
with
everyone.
As
time
went
on,
these
e-mails
became
more
involved
and
began
to
sound
more
like
stories
than
just
a
shopping
list
of
places
I
had
seen.
I
occasionally
even
managed
to
be
funny.
This
was
different
for
me
because
I
don't
usually
achieve
humor
when
I
talk
-
at
least
not
intentionally.
I
wrote
one
e-mail
about
my
skiing
retardation
,
and
I
got
about
fifteen
messages
the
next
day
in
which
people
thanked
me
for
giving
them
a
good
laugh.
I
was
never
quite
sure
which
e-mails
people
would
find
more
entertaining
than
others.
When
I
returned
from
studying
in
Spain
for
the
summer,
my
Dad
told
me
that
he
had
really
enjoyed
the
writing
style
I
used
in
my
e-mails.
He
said
that
sometimes
I
described
people,
events,
and
sights
in
original
ways
that
helped
him
think
about
them
differently
or
visualize
them
better.
I
knew
the
types
of
descriptions
he
was
referring
to
because
I
have
enjoyed
such
twists
of
language
when
I
come
across
them
in
books.
However,
I
read
over
my
e-mails
again
and
I
wasn't
able
to
spot
any
of
those
little
creative
word
choices.
My
dad
also
said
he
had
been
disappointed
when
he
received
an
e-mail
that
wasn't
quite
as
good
as
some
of
the
others.
Reading
over
the
e-mails
again,
I
had
no
idea
which
ones
were
better
written
than
the
others.
I'm
not
sure
why
I
have
such
difficulty
noticing
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
my
own
writing.
I
have
always
loathed
keeping
a
journal,
but
I
loved
writing
those
mass
e-mails
from
Europe.
I
never
do
writing
just
for
myself;
I
always
need
some
kind
of
motivation,
such
as
a
good
grade
or
an
interested,
approving
audience.
(I
love
to
share
my
writing
with
people
if
I
am
fairly
sure
they
will
be
interested
and
approving!)
When
I
do
have
an
audience
for
my
writing,
I
tend
to
be
easily
swayed
by
the
opinions
of
that
audience.
Many
people,
like
my
dad,
really
enjoyed
reading
my
e-mails.
Other
people
complained
that
they
were
too
long
and
detailed
and
told
me
that
they
didn't
read
them.
One
of
my
friends
commented,
Wow,
you
must
have
been
really
bored.
My
view
of
the
quality
of
writing
in
my
e-mails
could
change
daily,
depending
on
who
had
last
given
me
their
opinion.
I
hope
that
my
writing
history
progresses,
I
will
become
less
influenced
by
the
opinions
of
others.
Writing
the
e-mails
from
Spain
was
also
refreshing
because
it
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
communicate
in
my
native
language.
I
found
writing
in
Spanish
so
awkward
and
frustrating
at
times
because
I
am
unaccustomed
to
having
the
level
of
my
thoughts
exceed
the
level
of
my
writing.
When
I
wrote
a
mass
e-mail
each
week,
I
was
delighted
for
the
opportunity
to
play
with
words
and
express
my
emotions
exactly
as
I
felt
them.
Thus
another
year
of
my
writing
history
has
passed.
In
the
coming
year,
I
hope
to
continue
to
enhance
my
writing
and
my
work
as
a
WA.
My
major
goal
as
a
WA
is
to
improve
my
ability
to
help
the
students
discover
their
own
mistakes.
As
I
writer,
I
will
continue
my
crusade
against
wordiness
and
useless
information.
I
will
seek
to
better
recognize
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
my
papers
both
on
my
own
and
with
the
help
of
others.
At
the
same
time,
I
will
endeavor
to
not
be
too
heavily
swayed
by
the
opinions
of
others.
I
will
continue
to
appreciate
writing
as
an
indispensable
tool
for
heightening
my
interest
in
a
variety
of
subject
areas
and
expressing
my
thoughts
and
emotions
to
others.
