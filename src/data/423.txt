My
History
as
a
Writer
I
have
always
felt
like
writing
is
my
greatest
strength
as
a
student.
Although
I
have
experienced
my
fair
share
of
writerOs
block
and
have
written
a
few
papers
that
I
am
not
particularly
proud
of,
most
of
my
memories
of
writing
are
positive
ones.
My
first
real
memory
of
myself
as
a
writer
is
from
first
grade.
We
came
into
school
every
morning
and
wrote
several
sentences
about
what
we
had
done
the
day
before.
I
do
not
actually
remember
anything
specific
that
I
wrote
in
my
journal,
but
my
mom
still
has
it
and
I
have
looked
at
it
a
few
times
since
then.
It
is
fascinating
to
see
how
my
mind
worked
back
then.
It
is
strange
to
think
that
even
though
I
have
changed
so
much
since
then,
I
am
still
essentially
the
same
person.
Memory
is
a
peculiar
thing.
Today
I
remember
only
a
select
few
of
the
events
that
I
recorded
in
my
journal,
so
it
is
strange
to
look
at
my
journal
and
know
that
I
actually
wrote
about
these
things
which
today
I
have
no
recollection
of.
Fifth
grade
was
the
first
time
that
our
English
classes
were
broken
down
into
levels.
There
were
four
different
levels,
and
I
was
placed
in
the
top
class.
Although
I
do
not
really
remember
specific
assignments
from
the
class,
I
know
that
I
worked
harder
for
that
class
than
I
was
used
to.
I
was
used
to
getting
straight
AOs
in
English,
but
I
got
BOs
every
marking
period
in
that
class.
Our
teacher
treated
us
like
we
were
in
middle
school
and
gave
our
class
more
reading
and
writing
assignments
than
any
of
us
were
used
to,
but
it
was
definitely
an
excellent
growing
experience
for
me.
Even
though
I
disliked
that
class,
I
remember
I
was
happy
that
I
worked
as
hard
as
I
did
because
it
helped
prepare
me
for
middle
school.
I
remember
my
sixth
grade
English
teacher
particularly
well.
The
big
emphasis
in
that
class
was
on
grammar.
We
did
sentence
diagrams
in
class
almost
every
day,
and
worked
on
things
like
identifying
the
subjects,
verbs,
prepositional
phrases
and
other
components
of
sentences.
In
some
ways
I
liked
learning
grammar
because
I
thought
it
was
interesting
how
sentences
could
be
analyzed,
and
I
hoped
that
it
would
make
me
a
better
writer.
However,
at
the
same
time,
I
remember
thinking
that
diagramming
sentences
seemed
like
too
much
of
a
scientific
practice
to
apply
to
English
(and
I
have
always
hated
science).
Despite
my
mixed
feelings
on
learning
grammar,
I
respect
my
sixth
grade
teacher
for
teaching
it
to
us,
because
I
remember
when
it
came
time
to
review
grammar
during
the
rest
of
middle
school
and
high
school,
everyone
who
had
that
teacher
was
always
better
prepared
than
the
other
students.
Another
thing
I
remember
about
that
class
is
a
poem
that
I
wrote.
Our
assignment
was
to
write
a
ten
line
poem
about
a
color.
Everyone
else
in
the
class
picked
a
basic
color
like
red
or
blue,
but
I
wanted
to
be
different
so
I
picked
Nclear.O
Saying
that
my
teacher
loved
my
poem
would
be
an
understatement.
She
read
it
to
the
class
(which
is
always
slightly
embarrassing
when
you
are
in
middle
school)
and
suggested
that
I
enter
it
in
a
poetry
contest.
I
ended
up
entering
it
in
a
Pennsylvania
young
poets
contest
(or
something
of
that
nature)
and
it
was
published
in
a
book
of
poems.
I
still
have
the
book
today
and
feel
an
enormous
sense
of
pride
when
I
think
about
that
poem.
I
do
not
really
remember
that
much
about
my
English
classes
in
seventh
or
eighth
grade.
One
thing
from
eighth
grade
I
do
remember
was
writing
a
paper
that
was
five
pages
long
and
feeling
a
real
sense
of
accomplishment
because
that
was
the
longest
paper
I
had
ever
written.
The
paper
was
on
John
Hancock,
and
I
was
really
proud
of
that
paper,
so
I
was
shocked
when
I
got
a
NC
plusO
on
it.
That
was
the
lowest
grade
I
had
ever
gotten
on
a
piece
of
my
writing,
and
it
was
a
real
blow
to
my
ego.
What
bothered
me
about
that
paper
was
that
I
knew
I
had
worked
really
hard
and
felt
like
I
deserved
a
better
grade.
That
is
one
of
the
only
times
that
I
remember
getting
a
grade
(good
or
bad)
that
I
did
not
deserve.
I
took
Seminar
English
for
my
freshman,
sophomore
and
junior
years
in
high
school.
Out
of
everything
I
have
ever
written,
there
are
only
a
few
pieces
that
really
stand
out
in
my
memory,
and
a
research
paper
I
wrote
in
my
freshman
year
was
one
of
them.
I
had
to
write
a
research
paper
on
the
author
of
my
choice.
I
desperately
wanted
to
learn
about
Edgar
Allan
Poe,
so
I
chose
to
write
about
him.
That
paper
was
my
first
real
introduction
to
the
process
of
writing
a
real
research
paper.
We
had
requirements
for
the
number
of
sources
that
we
had
to
use,
had
to
do
a
real
bibliography
and
had
to
cite
a
certain
number
of
quotes.
Almost
everything
I
know
about
writing
research
papers
came
from
writing
that
one
paper.
My
paper
ended
up
being
fourteen
pages,
which
was
by
far
the
longest
paper
I
had
ever
written.
I
am
still
proud
of
that
paper,
especially
since
I
got
an
NA
plusO
on
it.
Eleventh
grade
I
was
very
ill
for
most
of
the
year
and
ended
up
turning
in
a
lot
of
assignments
late.
My
teacher
definitely
thought
that
I
was
just
slacking
off
and
probably
did
not
deserve
to
be
in
a
seminar
English
class
(and
understandably
so).
However,
he
understanding
about
my
circumstances
and
let
me
turn
in
quite
a
few
papers
that
were
weeks,
if
not
months
late,
at
the
end
of
the
last
marking
period.
Considering
the
fact
that
I
had
to
write
almost
an
entire
marking
periodOs
worth
of
papers
in
the
span
of
about
a
week,
I
was
not
sure
that
the
quality
of
my
writing
would
be
up
to
par,
and
I
was
just
hoping
for
a
passing
grade.
When
I
got
my
papers
back
from
my
teacher,
he
had
this
shocked
look
on
his
face.
At
first
I
thought
he
was
angry
at
me
for
getting
away
with
turning
in
so
much
work
late,
but
he
looked
at
me
and
said
NKathryn,
you
never
told
me
you
were
brilliant.O
Apparently
he
was
blown
away
by
my
writing.
Even
though
it
was
under
the
worst
of
circumstances,
that
was
one
of
the
best
compliments
I
have
ever
received
with
regard
to
my
writing.
Even
though
I
knew
I
was
capable
of
taking
seminar
English
my
senior
year,
I
had
heard
the
teacher
was
less
than
understanding
when
it
came
to
students
missing
class,
so
I
made
the
huge
mistake
of
taking
honors
English.
I
learned
absolutely
nothing
that
year,
and
when
I
think
about
it,
I
still
regret
not
taking
seminar
English
my
senior
year.
When
I
got
to
American
University
(I
transferred
to
Lafayette
my
sophomore
year),
I
was
not
sure
what
to
expect.
My
AP
scores
fulfilled
the
college
writing
requirement,
so
I
did
not
end
up
doing
that
much
writing
while
I
was
there.
There
are
two
papers
that
stand
out
from
my
freshman
year
though.
The
first
is
a
paper
I
wrote
for
my
Cinema
class
about
a
movie
called
NPunch
Drunk
Love.O
Even
though
I
was
not
really
used
to
writing
analysis
papers
on
anything
other
than
books,
I
really
enjoyed
writing
the
paper.
I
focused
my
paper
on
the
symbolism
throughout
the
movie,
and
was
thrilled
with
the
end
results
of
my
paper.
My
professor
ended
up
loving
the
paper
too,
and
I
ended
up
getting
an
NAO
on
it,
which
I
was
shocked
by
considering
that
he
only
gave
out
five
NAOsO
to
our
class
of
one
hundred
people.
He
called
out
everyoneOs
names
who
got
NAOsO
on
the
paper
and
had
us
stand
up
in
front
of
the
class
and
tell
them
what
our
papers
were
about.
That
paper,
along
with
another
paper
I
wrote
in
the
second
semester
for
my
NVictorian
Literature
and
SocietyO
class
is
one
of
the
best
three
papers
I
have
ever
written.
I
struggled
with
my
NVictorian
Literature
and
SocietyO
class.
The
first
paper
I
turned
in
for
the
class,
even
though
I
got
a
respectable
grade
(I
think
it
was
a
NBO),
my
professor
completely
tore
to
shreds.
There
were
red
marks
on
almost
every
sentence,
and
I
was
considerably
shaken
by
his
less
than
enthusiastic
comments.
When
he
said
he
would
allow
us
to
revise
our
papers,
I
jumped
at
the
opportunity
and
I
think
I
met
with
him
three
or
four
times
just
to
discuss
that
one
paper.
I
ended
up
bringing
my
grade
up
to
around
an
NA
minus,O
but
what
was
more
valuable
to
me
was
how
much
I
learned
from
working
on
the
paper
with
him.
That
class
was
definitely
one
of
the
hardest
classes
I
have
ever
taken,
yet
it
was
the
most
rewarding
because
I
learned
so
much
about
my
writing.
For
our
final
papers,
the
assignment
was
pretty
open
ended:
we
had
to
do
a
creative
piece
involving
at
least
five
of
the
authors
that
we
had
read.
I
ended
up
writing
a
paper
in
which
I
held
a
trial
for
NSalomeO
and
had
various
authors
as
character
witnesses
either
for
or
against
Salome.
When
my
professor
was
reading
my
paper
during
our
final
exam,
he
called
me
up
to
the
front
of
the
class
and
told
me
that
he
thought
my
paper
was
outstanding.
I
was
so
proud
of
myself
and
felt
like
I
had
come
such
a
long
way
in
just
one
semester.
I
am
not
really
that
happy
with
any
of
the
English
papers
I
have
written
so
far
at
Lafayette.
I
can
not
quite
put
my
finger
on
the
reason
why,
but
for
some
reason
I
have
struggled
with
assignments
I
have
been
given.
This
is
a
huge
problem
for
me
because
I
am
such
a
perfectionist
when
it
comes
to
my
writing.
If
I
do
not
feel
like
a
paper
of
mine
is
up
to
my
standards,
I
would
almost
rather
not
turn
it
in
than
turn
it
in
and
feel
ashamed
of
it.
I
am
quite
happy
with
the
history
papers
I
have
written,
one
in
particular.
I
wrote
a
paper
on
HitlerOs
rise
to
power
for
my
Introduction
to
History
class,
and
it
was
definitely
one
of
the
best
three
papers
I
have
ever
written.
I
think
the
reason
both
my
professor
and
I
loved
the
paper
was
because
I
made
an
honest
attempt
to
not
just
write
a
cut
and
dry
history
paper.
I
used
several
metaphors
and
tried
to
make
the
paper
as
interesting
and
well
written
as
possible.
I
just
hope
that
I
have
not
set
an
impossible
standard
for
all
of
my
other
history
papers
in
the
future
to
live
up
to,
because
part
of
me
is
not
sure
that
I
can
ever
write
a
history
paper
that
good
again.
My
family
has
always
been
supportive
of
my
writing.
My
mom
loves
reading
everything
I
write.
I
used
to
have
her
proofread
my
papers
when
I
was
in
middle
school
and
high
school.
I
still
email
her
a
large
percentage
of
the
papers
I
write
today,
but
now
I
do
it
because
I
know
she
thoroughly
enjoys
reading
them,
not
because
I
really
need
her
advice.
Sometimes
if
she
thinks
a
paper
is
particularly
good,
she
prints
it
out
and
shows
it
to
some
of
her
coworkers
and
my
grandparents.
I
think
reading
my
writing
and
sharing
it
with
other
people
makes
her
genuinely
happy,
which
boosts
my
self-esteem
as
a
writer.
In
general,
I
enjoy
hearing
feedback
about
my
writing,
positive
or
negative.
Obviously,
it
is
always
nice
to
hear
good
things
about
my
writing,
but
often
I
like
getting
constructive
criticism
more
than
praise
because
I
am
always
looking
for
new
ways
to
improve
my
writing.
Even
though
I
love
writing,
there
are
only
a
few
types
of
writing
in
which
I
consider
myself
to
be
adept.
For
instance,
I
love
writing
anything
in
which
I
have
to
make
an
argument
for
or
against
something.
Fortunately
for
me,
a
lot
of
my
college
papers
fall
into
that
category.
I
also
have
never
minded
doing
research
papers,
as
long
as
I
finding
the
topic
to
be
at
least
somewhat
interesting.
Most
of
my
friends,
many
of
whom
are
science
or
economics
majors,
can
not
fathom
why
I
would
want
to
be
an
English
and
History
major.
Even
my
sister,
who
is
a
business
major,
can
not
understand
why
I
would
willingly
subject
myself
to
countless
writing
papers.
They
all
say
that
they
would
much
rather
take
exams
than
write
papers.
However,
I
have
a
completely
different
stance
than
them;
if
given
the
choice
between
writing
a
paper
about
something
or
taking
a
test
on
it,
I
would
much
rather
write
a
paper,
which
is
one
of
the
many
reasons
why
science,
economics,
and
similar
subjects
have
never
appealed
to
me.
Even
though
I
enjoy
writing,
there
are
a
few
types
of
writing
that
I
have
never
liked.
I
am
not
sure
if
I
dislike
them
because
I
do
not
think
I
am
any
good
at
them,
or
if
it
is
because
they
simply
do
not
appeal
to
me.
I
have
a
feeling
it
is
a
combination
of
the
two,
although
the
former
probably
factors
in
more
than
the
latter
because
I
am
a
consummate
perfectionist
when
it
comes
to
writing.
One
type
of
writing
I
have
never
liked
is
creative
writing
of
any
kind.
I
have
convinced
myself
this
is
the
case,
although
there
are
the
obvious
exceptions
to
this,
considering
the
fact
that
two
of
my
favorite
things
I
have
ever
written
have
been
creative
pieces
(my
NClearO
poem
in
sixth
grade
and
my
paper
on
NSalomeO
during
my
freshman
year
of
college).
I
guess
my
problem
with
creative
writing
is
not
the
actual
writing
process
as
much
as
it
is
finding
the
inspiration
to
write
something
that
is
truly
creative.
Whenever
I
think
about
trying
to
write
something
creative,
like
maybe
trying
to
contribute
something
to
a
literary
magazine,
I
always
feel
like
I
am
condemned
to
end
up
writing
something
clich
and
unoriginal.
So
ultimately,
my
problem
with
creative
writing
is
not
so
much
about
the
process
of
the
actual
writing,
but
the
creative
process
in
general.
I
have
the
completely
opposite
problem
for
the
second
type
of
writing
that
I
dislike.
I
have
never
liked
writing
anything
about
myself.
Whenever
I
am
required
to
do
so
(which
fortunately,
is
not
too
often),
I
never
suffer
from
a
lack
of
ideas,
but
I
am
plagued
by
the
feeling
that
my
writing
does
not
adequately
express
my
ideas.
There
is
something
about
writing
in
the
first
person
that
just
does
not
sit
well
with
me.
Maybe
one
of
the
reasons
I
feel
this
way
is
because
when
I
am
writing
a
paper
in
which
I
am
making
an
argument,
even
though
the
ideas
are
my
own,
I
get
to
let
my
ideas
speak
for
myself
and
do
not
have
to
actually
involve
myself
in
the
actual
paper.
Writing
in
the
first
person
always
seems
so
informal
to
me
as
well,
and
I
think
I
have
always
been
better
at
more
formal,
structured
styles
of
writing.
