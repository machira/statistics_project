Literacy
Narrative
Summer,
2001
The
pen
between
my
fingers
is
sensuous,
alive
almost,
I
can
feel
its
power,
the
power
of
the
words
it
contains.
Pen
Is
Envy,
Aunt
Lydia
would
say,
quoting
another
Center
motto,
warning
us
away
from
such
objects.
And
they
were
right,
it
is
envy.
Just
holding
it
is
envy.
I
envy
the
Commander
his
pen.
It's
one
more
thing
I
would
like
to
steal.
(Atwood,
186)
As
my
classmates
discussed
this
passage
from
Margaret
Atwood's
The
Handmaid's
Tale
in
terms
of
phallicism
and
penis
envy,
my
thoughts
drifted
from
Sigmund
Freud's
theories
to
my
work
as
a
Writing
Associate
(which,
in
most
cases
remains
entirely
unconnected
to
Freudianism).
I
recalled
a
staff
meeting,
a
discussion
focused
on
the
importance
of
placing
the
pen
in
front
of
the
writer.
Ok,
I
had
thought
during
the
meeting,
this
is
another
gesture
aimed
at
making
the
writer
feel
comfortable.
Not
until
encountering
a
Writing
Associate
who
seemed
to
have
dismissed
this
lesson
did
I
begin
to
understand
the
strength
of
Atwood's
impotent
envy
and
the
significance
of
such
a
small
gesture
to
a
successful
conference.
I
sat
down
next
to
my
WA,
crossed
my
legs
and
turned
my
body
toward
her--our
positions
mirrored
each
other
as
we
assumed
the
postures
of
two
students
eagerly
willing
to
connect
through
academic
discussion.
She
was
pleasant;
she
asked
leading
questions
that
provoked
my
thoughts;
she
made
thoughtful
suggestions
and
marginal
notes
of
sections
requiring
clarification.
There
was
only
one
problem:
not
until
the
conclusion
of
our
twenty
minute
conference
did
my
Writing
Associate
relinquish
her
grasp
of
my
paper
and
the
pen
that
had
marked
its
margins.
I
began
to
experience
the
envy
Atwood
describes--an
envy
unrelated
to
gender,
and
entirely
contingent
upon
the
empowerment
of
validating
one's
self
through
writing.
Like
Atwood's
narrator,
I
found
myself
wanting
to
snatch
the
pen,
to
steal
it
because
it
seemed
to
symbolize
control
over
my
writing.
And,
after
all,
this
paper
was
mine--which
is
not
to
say
that
I
did
not
value
my
WA's
suggestions
and
comments.
But,
to
me,
the
beginning
of
the
conference
signaled
my
repossession
of
my
paper.
When
my
WA
held
on
to
my
paper,
her
pen
hovering
over
its
white
margins,
I
felt
like
a
mother
trying
to
retrieve
her
child
from
daycare--except
the
sitter
refused
to
let
go
of
the
child's
hand.
Taken
to
it
furthest
extent,
my
metaphor
likens
the
writing
process
to
childbirth,
and
I
cannot
deny
that
the
two
are
ultimate
acts
of
creativity
and
self-expression.
And,
as
humans,
we
become
protective
and
sensitive
whenever
we
reveal
a
glimpse
of
ourselves
to
the
public
eye;
however
critical
a
writer
or
parent
may
be
of
her
own
creation,
we
are
rather
less
receptive
to
exterior
imposed
authority.
So,
if
we
consider
the
writing
process
as
an
act
of
empowerment
and
self-validation--then
the
writing
conference
becomes
more
than
a
discussion
of
thesis
and
conclusion;
it
becomes
a
discussion
of
the
self--
and
it
can
become
a
power
struggle
or
a
violation
if
we
as
Writing
Associates
are
not
careful
to
recall
that
the
power
of
a
paper
is
not
our
own.
Perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
to
consider
our
writing
(in
keeping
with
the
parent-child
metaphor)
as
an
extension
of
ourselves,
a
public
voice
through
which
we
can
be
bolder
and
more
provocative
than
our
self-consciousness
often
allows
in
classroom
debates.
This
boldness
in
writing
gives
permanence
to
the
radical
and
the
uncertain
that
we
often
squelch
without
the
protective
detachment
of
separating
our
faces
and
mouths
from
our
written
words.
Writing
is
a
safe
outlet
for
our
boldest
ideas
and
our
hesitant
thoughts
because
it
is
so
often
detached
from
us:
we
write
a
journal,
a
paper,
and
we
can
turn
this
work
in
without
discussing
the
self-consciousness
lurking
beneath
the
black
and
white
text.
But
the
writing
conference
changes
all
of
that.
One
of
the
greatest
challenges,
then,
for
the
Writing
Associate
is
to
encounter
both
the
public
and
private
voices
in
the
writing
conference.
In
my
own
conference,
I
have
met
the
articulate
speaker
with
the
rambling
paper
and
the
tight-lipped
student
with
the
eloquent
written
work.
By
controlling
the
pen
and
paper
during
a
conference,
a
WA
fosters
the
disconnection
between
a
writer
and
her
written
work--hindering
the
conference's
progress
because
the
WA
is
unable
to
view
the
writer
as
a
whole,
both
public
and
private,
person.
Without
the
merger
of
the
physical
and
written
voices
to
reveal
a
coherent
self,
a
conference
results
in,
at
best,
a
hesitant
writer
and
limited
productivity.
In
a
more
extreme
situation,
Frederick
Douglass
(in
his
autobiography)
explains
"the
act
of
writing
for
the
slave
constituted
the
act
of
creating
a
public,
historical
self'
(5).
Contemporary
society
reminisces
of
Douglass
as
a
charismatic
speaker;
yet
the
former
slave
acknowledges
that
he
achieves
a
potency
in
writing
that
he
could
not
attain
in
his
private
life.
Imagine,
then,
the
explosive
power
of
merging
Douglass's
written
eloquence
with
his
impassioned
speaking,
a
combination
that
required
nineteenth
century
society
to
acknowledge
both
the
public
and
private
voices
of
Frederick
Douglass.
For
the
Writing
Associate,
a
truly
successful
conference
requires
a
similar
affirmation
of
the
public
self
and
the
constant
recognition
of
a
private
self
lurking
behind
the
printed
text.
One
of
my
most
challenging--and
I
must
admit,
least
successful--conferences
centered
around
this
struggle
of
balancing
the
public
and
private
selves
of
the
writer.
Before
me
was
a
paper
containing
the
seeds
of
ideas
that
could
blossom
into
a
well-argued,
provocative
paper.
I
was
sure
I
could
cultivate
these
ideas
by
probing
the
writer.
And
so
I
followed
our
introduction
with
a
series
of
questions
about
her
goals,
her
connecting
ideas.
.
.
and
the
results
were
disastrous.
Rather
than
feeling
challenged
by
my
approach,
this
writer
seemed
to
feel
attacked.
She
recoiled
into
herself,
and
by
the
time
I
shifted
to
a
less
invasive
tactic
she
had
closed
herself
off
from
me
and
from
the
conference.
Other
writers
had
(and
still
do)
responded
to
this
approach--encouraged
by
my
boisterous
interest
in
their
work
and
stimulated
by
the
developing
connection
of
their
written
and
spoken
words.
This
writer
seemed
to
feel
violated
(much
as
I
had
when
my
own
Writing
Associate
clutched
her
pen
over
my
paper
for
the
entire
conference);
my
questions
were
threatening
the
public
voice
she
had
boldly
set
forward
in
her
writing.
Still,
I
wanted
to
challenge
this
writer,
to
encourage
her
to
consider
why
she
wrote
as
she
did--but
I
needed
to
take
a
gentler,
more
individualized
approach
that
would
prompt
her
to
say
more
than
"I
don't
know."
I
wish
I
could
claim
an
overwhelming
success
for
this
second
meeting;
instead
we
seemed
to
make
only
a
small
step.
When
I
consider
this
situation
in
relation
to
Atwood's
text,
it
seems
only
logical
that
the
more
we
put
ourselves
into
our
writing,
the
more
sensitive
we
become
to
sharing
any
authority
over
our
work--resulting
(in
this
case
at
least)
to
a
forced
detachment
between
public
and
private
selves,
an
unwillingness
to
claim
any
connection
to
the
written
work,
and
a
string
of
"I
don't
know"
responses
to
probing
questions.
This
fall
semester
experience
was
echoed
in
my
spring
Creative
Writing
class.
Almost
every
class
period,
each
member
of
the
class
was
required
to
stand
at
the
central
podium
and
read
her
work
aloud.
Before
our
first
session
one
student
confided
in
me,
describing
how
difficult
the
writing
assignment
had
been
for
him.
He
said
he
feared
putting
too
much
of
himself
into
the
poem
because
he
knew
while
writing
it
that
he
would
have
to
share
it
while
fifteen
pairs
of
eyes
stared
at
him.
Throughout
the
semester
my
Creative
Writing
professor
urged
us
to
stand
behind
our
words,
to
read
with
confidence
the
ideas
we
had
scrawled
on
our
papers.
The
public
readings
became
easier
for
me
as
I
learned
that
my
private
writing
does
not
necessarily
mirror
my
personal
life--and
I
may
have
even
learned
to
transfer
some
of
the
private
boldness
into
my
public
readings.
Somehow
this
gradual
convergence
of
the
private
and
public
voices
seems
like
it
should
be
the
ultimate
goal
for
writers
and
writing
conferences;
the
Writing
Associate's
role
in
this
convergence
is
to
encourage
the
writer
to
connect
with
her
text--to
encourage
the
boldness
of
creativity
and
self-expression
as
an
empowering
experience
for
both
the
written
and
spoken
words.
This
idea
was
reinforced
by
my
experience
with
a
Writing
Associate
who--probably
without
even
realizing
the
discomfort
her
action
caused--distanced
me
from
my
work
with
her
pen
poised
over
my
work.
And,
by
failing
to
take
an
individual
approach
in
my
conference
with
a
hesitant
writer,
I
caused
the
same
breach.
Possibly
one
of
the
most
disquieting
aspects
of
Atwood's
passage
is
the
reader's
recognition
that
the
situation
is
awry--a
pen
is
not
supposed
to
be
a
coveted
item
that
provokes
envy.
As
readers
we
realize
that
Atwood's
narrator
and
Frederick
Douglass
make
their
statements
from
extenuating
circumstances
the
everyday
writer
will
never
experience
(except
vicariously
through
such
texts).
The
pen
is
intended
as
a
tool
of
ultimate
self-expression--as
a
means
of
transferring
the
private
self
to
the
public
realm.
Yet
there
are
few
opportunities
for
this
convergence
in
the
standard
academic
world:
written
assignments
encourage
the
private
voice
while
classroom
discussions
foster
the
public
voice.
The
writing
conference
is
a
unique
institution
in
its
emphasis
on
discussing
the
written
words--and
Writing
Associates
should
note
the
careful
balance
that
must
be
maintained
to
achieve
the
most
successful
conference.
