The
primary
tenet
of
the
CWP
is
stated
on
our
home
webpage:
NWA
support
is
not
an
editorial
service
designed
to
eliminate
mechanical
errors
in
writing,
but
rather
a
way
of
improving
studentsO
critical
reasoning
and
analytical
skills
through
meaningful
conversations
with
peers.O
So
I
have
wondered
why,
for
all
my
years
as
a
writer,
I
have
had
a
tendency
to
focus
on
the
intricacies
of
grammar,
syntax,
and
the
like.
And
it
was
not
until
I
underwent
the
application
process
for
the
CWP
that
I
began
to
realize
the
mechanics
of
writing
are
perhaps
the
least
important
part
of
the
writing
process.
Now,
donOt
be
mistaken,
a
good
writer
is
most
often
a
competent
speller
and
grammarian,
but
for
some
of
the
best
writers,
this
does
not
necessarily
hold
true.
Take
Jane
Austen,
for
example
and
the
misuse
of
a
singular
Otheir.O
I
have
come
to
learn
through
course
work,
CWP
instruction,
and
personal
writing
endeavors
that
the
key
to
maturing
as
a
writer
is
the
writing
process
itself.
It
comes
as
no
surprise
that
our
staff
meetings
revolve
around
this
ideology
and
that
the
CWPOs
pedagogy
is
derived
from
the
notion
that
our
service
is
intended
to
create
a
dialogue
between
associate
and
student
aimed
to
provide
Oinformed
and
intelligent
readings
of
works-in-progressEto
help
students
formulate
and
answer
difficult
questions
about
their
own
writing.O
This
thought
is
not
only
the
dogma
of
our
program
and
focal
point
of
our
instruction,
but
truly
seems
to
be
the
most
logical
avenue
to
completing
the
writing
process
successfully.
But
recently,
in
an
interview
with
a
WA
candidate,
the
student
expressed
a
habit
of
nitpicking
grammatical
elements
of
a
paper.
And
so,
I
have
come
to
realize
through
my
experience
as
a
WA
that
I
am
far
from
alone
in
this
engagement
and
recognize
the
importance
of
imparting
the
conception
of
writing
as
a
process
upon
students
-
a
process
that
involves,
time,
forethought,
and
prognostication.
But
the
process
does
not
end
there;
revision,
re-revision,
peer
consultation,
more
revision,
and
a
holistic
examination
of
a
completed
work
all
contribute
to,
and
are
perhaps
necessary
to
the
transformation
from
a
work-in-progress
to
one
that
is
competent,
cogent,
and
complete.
My
realization
has
taken
time
and
effort
and
did
not
necessarily
occur
consciously.
But
in
reflection
I
am
fully
ware
that
it
is
a
direct
result
of
working
with
an
array
of
assignment
lengths,
types,
styles,
and
the
accompanying
student
writers.
To
that
degree
I
view
my
participation
in
the
program
as
beneficial
in
two
distinct
ways.
For
one,
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
contribute
to
the
campus
environment,
striving
to
act
as
a
resource
to
students
in
need
of
help
with
the
writing
process.
And
secondly,
this
position
has
lead
me
to
feel
like
a
stronger,
more
competent
writer.
To
first
speak
to
my
own
development
as
a
writer,
I
believe
that
much
of
my
own
maturation
is,
in
fact,
due
to
my
work
with
the
CWP.
In
addition
to
staff
meeting
instruction,
simply
undergoing
dialogue
with
other
student
writers
gives
rise
to
insight
that
may
otherwise
be
arrived
at
much
more
arduously
or
not
at
all.
For
example,
I
have
worked
with
students
who
frequently
struggle
in
assignment
interpretation.
Often
a
professor
may
assign
a
writing
prompt
that
is
highly
specific
or
contrarily,
broadly
ambiguous.
Not
only
have
I
come
to
realize
that
the
professor
may
do
so
intentionally,
but
through
dealing
with
the
studentsO
struggle
of
assignment
interpretation,
I
consider
myself
to
now
possess
a
skill
set
of
interpretation
and
in
turn
synthesis
of
assignments
in
a
creative
manner.
If
performed
successfully,
creativity
is
often
a
way
of
differentiating
oneself
from
twenty
different
papers
about
materially
identical
topics.
A
second
progression
that
my
writing
process
has
undergone
is
one
of
increased
structure.
In
the
early
stages
of
writing
education,
I
found
myself
spilling
ink
as
quickly
as
the
thoughts
flowed
into
my
head.
Albeit,
in
creative
writing
and
informal
assignments,
this
may
be
a
useful
form
of
expression,
but
in
terms
of
technical
writing,
participation
in
the
CWP
has
acted
as
what
I
consider
to
be
a
remedy
to
this
less
sophisticated
approach.
My
writing
process
D
at
least
when
approaching
a
research,
analytical,
or
technical
writing
assignment
D
is
one
of
disciplined
regimen:
a
page
of
roman
numerals
is
my
first
strategy
to
organize
thoughts.
This
consists
of
a
vague
outline
to
orient
my
written
discussion.
Next,
these
numerals
are
expounded
by
bullets
that
comprise
my
original
(or
somewhat
derived)
ideas.
And
finally,
this
pre-write
document
is
populated
by
page
numbers,
quotations,
and
alternative
sources
that
provide
support
to
what
is
soon-to-be
written.
From
here,
I
have
found
that
the
actual
writing
becomes
fare
more
concise
and
fluid.
It
is
obvious
to
me
during
the
review
process
that
my
thoughts
were
organized
before
they
became
characters
on
a
page.
The
regimen
that
I
have
developed
is
not
surprisingly
a
product
of
working
with
a
countless
number
of
student
writers
who
are
currently
facing
difficulty
with
their
writing.
It
seems
to
me
that
the
only
thing
more
effective
than
learning
from
your
mistakes
is
learning
from
your
mistakes
and
the
mistakes
of
others.
This
thought
gives
rise
to
the
other
facet
of
CWP
mentoring,
that
the
opportunity
to
help
other
students
progress
their
writing
styles
contributes
to
the
sentiment
of
participation
in
a
value-added
experience.
Now
donOt
get
me
wrong,
some
students
seem
to
despise
their
WA
conferences.
They
show
up
late,
bring
no
material
to
work
with,
and
seem
disinterested
during
conferences.
But
those
students
who
bring
work
to
our
meetings
that
they
are
obviously
proud
of
their
progress
are
those
who
reciprocate
the
efforts
of
a
WA.
Furthermore,
after
a
conference
one
who
continues
inquiries
via
email
late
into
the
nights;
those
are
the
students
that
make
me
feel
as
if
my
role
as
a
WA
really
carries
significance
to
the
advancement
of
the
CollegeOs
academic
goals.
I
have
spent
my
past
year
as
a
WA
trying
to
determine
how
and
why
a
WA
conference
may
go
well
or
poorly
(and
Tatu
has
spend
much
more
than
a
year
doing
the
same).
Much
of
the
outcome
is
determine
by
a
studentOs
personality,
but
there
are
a
number
of
factors
we
as
WAs
can
control,
the
facilitative
approach
being
paramount.
It
is
often
tempting
to
red-mark
a
studentOs
document
and
analyze
each
miniscule
error
and
in
turn,
convey
these
revisions.
This
approach
will
invariably
lead
to
tension
and
derision
for
both
the
student
writer
as
well
as
the
WA.
The
best
conferences,
instead,
are
truly
a
dialogue.
I
like
to
think
of
my
conferences
as
a
good
interview
where
the
WA
is
the
interviewee.
It
is
important
to
think
of
the
student
as
the
interviewer
because,
just
like
a
successful
job
interview,
a
successful
WA
conference
is
most
usually
indicated
when
the
interviewer
is
doing
most
of
the
talking.
The
facilitative
approach
allows
the
students
to
express
themselves
and
their
thought
processes
to
the
writing
associate.
It
is
this
exact
pedagogy,
in
my
eyes,
that
leads
to
self-realization.
Whereas
a
critical
instructor
may
spoon-feed
the
writer
suggestions
for
correction
and
improvement,
the
facilitative
instructor
is
ultimately
the
most
productive
way
to
teach
a
student
how
to
coherently
express
himself
or
herself
on
paper.
The
reason
being
that
the
writer
learns
to
develop
a
methodology
that
is
reflective
and
gets
them
thinking
about
their
own
writing
and,
furthermore,
can
be
utilized
in
future
writing
endeavors.
My
experiences
that
speak
best
to
this
discussion
are
not
those
of
formal
writing
conferences
but
instead
during
those
inevitable
times
when
a
friend
asks
the
imminent
question
that
is
to
be
expected
in
holding
this
position:
Nbro,
are
you
a
WA?
Can
you
read
my
paper?O
These
are
the
individuals
who
expect
us
WAs
to
go
through
their
paper
with
a
fine-toothed
comb
and
seed
out
the
errors.
I
tend
not
to
comply.
Instead,
I
encourage
my
friends
to
work
with
me,
if
just
for
a
short
while,
to
let
me
know
what
problems
they
are
having
with
the
prompt.
More
often
than
not,
this
leads
to
the
beloved
dialogue
so
desired
by
a
writing
associate
during
which
time
a
discussion
about
the
challenges
and
obstacles
faced
while
writing
may
be
kneaded.
Through
my
experiences
as
a
WA,
I
have
come
to
learn
how
the
pedagogy
of
the
CWP
encourages
a
learning
process
for
both
student
and
associate.
It
is
the
reason
why
the
program
is
in
high
demand
and
it
is
the
reason
why
the
program
is
so
successful.
Nonetheless,
whether
it
be
cooperation,
interpretation,
or
organization,
challenges
as
an
associate
will
occur.
But
as
long
as
you
can
get
to
the
first
step,
that
is
arriving
at
the
conference,
I
remember
an
important,
but
often
overlooked
piece
of
information:
the
conferences
are
intended
to
be
a
dialogue
and
a
dialogue
can
only
occur
if
both
parties
are
contributing
to
the
discussion.
And
so,
I
look
forward
to
another
year,
and
another
learning
experience
as
part
of
the
Lafayette
College
CWP.
