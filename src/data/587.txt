Literacy
Narrative
The
ability
to
write
well,
as
with
many
endeavors,
stems
from
a
combination
of
natural
talent,
practice
and
experience.
As
writers,
we
must
learn
to
allow
our
experiences
to
shape
us,
but
we
must
also
be
able
to
mold
our
experiences
into
useable
and
formative
events
from
which
we
can
extract
meaning.
We
must
be
able
to
survey
our
experiences
like
photographs
so
that
we
can
analyze
them,
whether
we
do
so
in
order
to
write
about
them,
or
whether
we
merely
desire
to
grow
as
writers
from
them.
In
the
past
year,
I
have
often
found
myself
in
this
state
of
literary
reflection.
In
large
part,
this
is
because,
from
last
summer
to
the
present,
I
have
engaged
in
several
forms
of
writing
that
I
was
previously
unfamiliar
with.
Primarily,
I
began
last
summer
with
my
first
foray
into
journalism,
a
writing
form
that
forced
me
to
rearrange
my
preconceived
notions
on
how
to
both
research
and
write.
Secondly,
and
most
importantly,
I
chose
to
spend
the
2007-2008
school
year
abroad
in
Ireland
at
Trinity
College
Dublin,
where
I
was
thrown
into
a
school
system
and
way
of
learning
so
different
from
our
American
customs
that
I
thought
I
might
never
grow
accustomed
to
them.
However,
despite
my
atypical
and
sometimes
extremely
trying
writing-related
experiences
over
the
past
year,
I
have
never
been
quite
so
aware
of
how
my
experiences
have
improved
my
ability
to
express
myself
as
a
writer.
I
have
learned
just
how
far
I
can
stretch
my
literary
limbs,
and
I
feel
I
have
become
something
of
a
chameleon,
able
to
insert
myself
into
various
forms
of
writing
without
losing
my
personal
perspective
or
point
of
view.
I
have
without
a
doubt
grown
as
a
writer
in
the
past
year,
and
I
am
confident
that,
due
to
my
many
and
varied
experiences
with
different
forms
of
writing,
I
can
be
a
more
effective,
sensitive
and
knowledgeable
WA
than
I
have
ever
been
previously.
One
of
the
more
rewarding
new
writing
experiences
I
engaged
in
over
the
past
year
was
my
first
journalistic
article,
written
for
a
small,
fledgling
magazine
called
The
Wildlife
Professional.
I
have
been
an
intern
at
the
ProfessionalOs
parent
company,
The
Wildlife
Society,
for
three
summers
now,
each
year
moving
my
way
up
within
the
Publications
and
Information
Resources
Office,
where
the
Professional
is
produced.
As
a
second
year
intern
at
the
Professional,
I
was
given
the
chance
to
write
an
article
for
one
of
the
magazineOs
rotating
features,
an
opportunity
that
I
eagerly
accepted.
Of
course,
writing
a
magazine
article
is
not
an
easy
feat,
especially
when
one
is
accustomed
to
writing
academic
essays.
Because
of
my
lack
of
familiarity
with
the
process,
I
had
to
re-train
myself
to
write
and
research
in
the
less
formal
journalistic
style
required
for
the
magazine.
For
instance,
rather
than
doing
a
close
reading
of
a
passage
from
a
book
or
poem,
or
quoting
a
scholarly
article,
my
research
took
the
form
of
conducting
interviews
with
relevant
persons
or
reading
other
magazine
or
newspaper
pieces
on
topics
pertinent
to
my
article.
I
had
to
train
myself
to
keep
the
style
and
tone
of
my
article
less
formal
and
more
witty.
I
even
had
to
familiarize
myself
with
swapping
the
all-important
thesis
for
a
nutgraf,
and
transitional
sentences
for
headings
and
subheadings.
Though
this
was
a
difficult
transition,
it
was
also
both
exciting
and
beneficial.
For
example,
because
journalistic
writing
must
be
concise
but
informative,
I
became
very
familiar
with
the
process
of
editing
a
story
so
that
it
was
anchored
in
fact,
but
was
padded
with
enough
details
so
that
it
remained
interesting.
This
skill
was
especially
useful
for
me,
since
I
have
always
been
an
extremely
wordy
writer,
and
it
was
something
I
saw
myself
taking
back
to
my
academic
writing
once
I
returned
to
college.
It
became
easier
for
me
to
omit
superfluous
details
that
were
unnecessary
to
make
my
point
or
prove
my
thesis.
I
suspect
that
next
year,
when
I
return
to
my
job
as
a
WA,
I
will
be
able
to
apply
this
skill
to
my
studentsO
papers
as
well.
Additionally,
journalism
allows
for
a
considerable
amount
more
creativity
than
does
academic
writing.
Thus,
I
was
able
to
hone
my
story-telling
abilities
and
find
a
voice
different
than
the
one
that
I
had
used
in
all
my
academic
assignments.
Instead
of
discontinuing
this
voice
and
creativity
when
I
went
back
to
school,
I
did
my
best
to
combine
them
with
the
more
formal,
structured
process
that
I
use
when
writing
college
essays.
I
found
that
this
allowed
me
to
be
more
original
when
constructing
theses
or
designing
essay
topics,
and
it
also,
I
feel,
improved
my
ability
to
remain
engaging
rather
than
dull
throughout
an
essay.
As
a
WA,
I
believe
I
will
be
better
able
to
assist
students
in
finding
their
own
voices
as
writers
now
that
I
have
a
more
concrete
idea
of
my
own.
Finally,
after
struggling
through
my
first
article,
repeating
the
process
for
the
article
I
wrote
this
summer
was,
comparatively,
a
breeze.
The
research
was
easier,
I
agonized
less
over
my
lede,
and
the
angle
I
chose
to
take
on
the
story
was
much
simpler
to
execute.
Not
only
have
I
improved
as
an
academic
writer
because
of
my
experiences
writing
for
a
magazine,
but,
thankfully,
I
have
also
improved
as
a
journalist.
Another
crucial
writing-related
experience
I
had
this
past
year
involved
my
year
spent
at
Trinity
College
Dublin,
IrelandOs
most
prestigious
university.
Before
embarking
on
my
journey
to
Dublin,
the
academic
environment
was
my
biggest
concern
and
the
aspect
of
my
experience
that
I
was
most
worried
about
adjusting
to.
In
the
end,
the
academics
were
certainly
manageable,
but
they
were
more
difficult
than
anything
I
have
encountered
to
date.
In
part
this
is
because
Trinity
has
extremely
high
standards
for
its
students,
but
it
is
also
partly
because
I
was
sent
through
the
rigorous
process
of
adjusting
to
an
unfamiliar
school
system
with
requirements
far
removed
from
anything
I
was
accustomed
to
in
America.
This
was
true
for
almost
all
facets
of
TrinityOs
academia;
from
the
way
classes
were
conducted,
to
class
sizes,
to
the
way
professors
behaved
and
taught,
to
what
was
required
of
students.
Nowhere,
however,
were
the
differences
greater
(at
least
in
my
opinion)
than
in
what
was
expected
from
a
student
essay,
especially
the
English
essays.
At
Trinity,
for
the
second
time
in
a
year,
I
had
to
re-teach
myself
to
research
and
write
using
unfamiliar
methods
and
practices.
In
my
experience,
the
biggest
disparity
between
American
and
Irish
college
essays
is
that
essays
written
at
Trinity
are
always
research-based,
regardless
of
the
department
they
are
being
written
for.
To
be
fair,
of
the
two
departments
I
was
involved
in,
history
and
English,
this
requirement
is
only
unusual
for
English
essays.
For
these,
instead
of
writing
oneOs
own
close
analysis
of
a
novel,
play
or
poem
into
an
essay,
students
at
Trinity
are
always
required
to
use
critical
sources
to
back
up
their
ideas.
As
such,
every
essay
is
what
American
college
students
might
regard
as
a
research
paper,
in
which
at
least
five
critical
sources
are
expected
as
support
for
each
essay.
At
first,
this
system
made
it
extremely
difficult
to
insert
any
of
my
own
ideas
into
the
essays;
instead
it
felt
more
like
I
was
agreeing
or
disagreeing
with
one
group
of
critics
rather
than
attempting
my
own
analysis
of
a
certain
work.
Adding
to
the
difficulty
of
this
system
was
the
projected
length
of
the
essays,
which
were
meant
to
be
approximately
seven
to
eight
pages
each.
With
such
limited
space,
research
had
to
be
perfectly
balanced
with
oneOs
own
ideas
so
that
the
essay
was
not
simply
a
regurgitation
of
ideas
from
critical
works,
a
harmony
that
was
challenging
to
achieve.
Moreover,
the
way
professors
at
Trinity
react
to
and
assess
essays
is
much
more
subjective
than
at
American
colleges.
In
addition
to
grading
an
essay
based
on
the
strength
of
and
support
for
a
particular
argument,
professors
also
give
grades
based
on
whether
or
not
they
agree
with
a
particular
argument.
Of
course,
as
in
any
college,
this
tendency
varies
from
professor
to
professor,
but,
in
my
experience,
if
a
Trinity
studentOs
opinion
differs
from
a
professorOs
opinion,
the
student
is
likely
to
be
penalized
for
it.
Though
these
unusual
customs
were
at
times
very
difficult
to
adjust
to,
they
without
a
doubt
broadened
my
horizons
as
a
writer.
For
instance,
over
time,
I
learned
to
adjust
my
usage
of
critical
texts
so
that
they
were
working
for
and
validating
my
ideas
rather
than
the
other
way
around;
the
texts
became
the
support
for
my
argument
rather
than
my
entire
argument
itself.
I
also
became
a
far
more
proficient
and
efficient
researcher,
learning
where
to
look
for
the
best
sources
and
also
how
to
best
apply
them
to
my
essays.
Once
I
got
better
at
this,
my
grades
began
to
improve,
not
because
I
was
pandering
to
professors,
but
because,
with
a
more
solidly
constructed
and
balanced
essay,
professors
were
likely
more
swayed
towards
my
opinions
than
they
had
been
previously.
Excellent
research
abilities
are
an
invaluable
asset
for
a
writer,
and
I
have
already
noticed
how
my
improved
researching
skills
make
my
role
as
a
writer
infinitely
easier.
This
is
also
a
skill
I
can
apply
to
my
job
as
a
WA,
since
I
will
be
able
not
only
to
better
direct
students
to
the
best
web-based
and
print
resources,
I
will
also
be
able
to
assist
them
in
properly
applying
and
integrating
their
research
into
their
essays.
Also
at
Trinity,
I
had
my
first
experience
with
a
historiography
course
and
writing
historiographical
essays.
Historiography,
or
the
study
of
the
way
in
which
history
is
both
obtained
and
transmitted,
is
a
fascinating
historical
discipline.
At
Trinity,
the
course
I
took
was
centered
on
the
historiography
of
colonialism
in
India,
and
the
ways
in
which
the
methods
of
collecting
and
writing
history
shaped
how
IndiaOs
past
is
perceived.
Naturally,
when
writing
essays
for
this
class,
we
were
required
to
write
historiographical
essays,
something
I
had
never
before
done.
Unlike
a
typical
history
essay
in
which
students
analyze
primary
and
secondary
sources
in
an
effort
to
make
conclusions
about
historical
periods
or
events,
historiographical
essays
require
students
to
focus
on
how
scholarly
articles
or
books
are
written,
what
they
say,
or
even
who
wrote
them,
in
order
to
make
conclusions
on
what
this
information
implies
about
how
history
has
been
portrayed.
In
order
to
do
this,
I
had
to
train
myself
not
to
automatically
analyze
the
text
I
was
reading;
rather,
I
needed
to
try
to
determine
how
authors
understood
or
portrayed
Indian
culture,
why
they
did
this,
and
what
the
conclusions
they
came
to
signified.
Again,
learning
this
new
method
of
writing,
though
hard
to
get
used
to,
was
in
the
end
extremely
rewarding.
In
taking
this
class,
I
proved
to
myself
that
I
have
the
ability
to
turn
certain
writing
habits
on
and
off,
such
as
the
urge
to
analyze
a
work
in
a
certain
way.
I
have
shown
myself
that
I
am
a
versatile
writer
capable
of
learning
and
adjusting
to
various
literary
genres.
This
skill
will
certainly
enhance
my
skills
as
a
WA,
since
I
will
now
be
better
able
to
assist
my
students
with
more
and
varied
forms
of
writing.
I
will
also
be
able
to
advise
them
on
how
to
tailor
their
own
writing
skills
to
work
within
unfamiliar
areas
of
academia,
as
I
now
have
a
considerable
amount
of
experience
with
doing
so
myself.
Obviously,
since
I
chose
to
go
abroad
last
year,
I
was
not
able
to
participate
in
the
College
Writing
Program.
As
such,
I
did
not
have
the
chance
to
further
hone
and
improve
my
skills
as
a
WA.
However,
I
do
not
think
I
will
be
a
rusty
or
inexpert
WA
because
of
this.
Instead,
I
believe
that
my
experiences
both
in
Ireland
and
at
The
Wildlife
Professional
have
helped
me
to
locate
my
own
identity
as
a
writer.
They
have,
through
forcing
me
to
learn
new
disciplines
and
write
in
unfamiliar
ways,
allowed
me
to
focus
on
and
stretch
my
own
abilities
in
a
way
I
have
been
unable
to
do
thus
far.
They
have
both
shown
me
my
limits
and
offered
me
ways
to
overcome
these
limits,
and
they
have
without
question
strengthened
my
academic
resilience.
My
experiences
in
the
past
year
have
surely
made
me
a
better
writer,
and
have
allowed
me
time
to
reflect
on
why.
I
believe
that
this
ability
will
make
me
a
better
WA;
because
I
understand
myself
as
a
writer
more
clearly,
I
will
be
able
to
empathize
with
and
help
my
students
more
effectively
than
I
have
in
the
past.
