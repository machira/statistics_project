WA
Literacy
Narrative
This
past
year
as
a
WA
has
been
a
challenging
yet
ultimately
rewarding
experience.
My
first
semester
as
a
WA,
I
worked
with
a
300-level
Economics
class,
a
field
in
which
I
had
no
prior
experience.
My
second
semester
I
WAed
for
a
VAST
class
that
discussed
perceptions
of
science
and
scientists.
This
past
summer,
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
have
the
opportunity
to
work
as
a
WA
for
the
SPAL
program,
working
with
ten
incoming
freshman
students.
I
feel
as
though
I
have
fully
immersed
myself
in
the
College
Writing
Program
and
experienced
the
many
scenarios
it
offers.
During
the
past
year,
I
have
had
many
positive
experiences
and
a
few
negative
experiences
as
a
WA,
which
have
greatly
impacted
my
perceptions
of
an
ideal
conference
and
affected
my
own
writing.
During
my
first
semester
as
a
WA,
I
was
thrust
into
the
position
of
WAing
for
an
upper-level
Economics
course.
I
had
never
taken
an
economics
class
in
my
life,
so
I
was
hesitant.
I
was
highly
dubious
of
my
ability
to
understand
the
papers
I
would
read,
but
I
found
that
utilizing
the
facilitative
approach
to
conferencing
was
ideal
for
this
type
of
situation.
As
only
a
junior
I
frequently
found
myself
working
with
seniors
who
had
far
more
experience
writing
economics
papers.
Yet
I
found
that
my
lack
of
knowledge
in
the
field
of
economics
ultimately
benefitted
the
conference
process
and
the
students.
Using
the
facilitative
approach,
I
would
ask
the
students
to
explain
the
meaning
of
some
terms.
By
requiring
the
students
to
define
some
terms,
their
own
understanding
of
the
concepts
was
solidified
and
I
could
then
understand
the
nuances
of
their
arguments.
I
would
also
prompt
them
to
explain
their
arguments
in
their
own
words,
without
relying
on
the
terminology,
which
was
also
helpful.
This
experience
also
led
me
to
believe
that
sometimes
it
is
best
to
have
someone
who
does
not
know
the
material
read
your
paper.
Most
papers
are
supposed
to
be
written
for
an
educated,
yet
not
expert,
audience.
Because
of
this
audience
specification,
it
made
my
particular
situation
ideal.
Students
benefitted
from
the
facilitative
approach
by
answering
the
questions
I
asked
about
their
arguments.
My
second
semester
was
also
challenging,
yet
for
a
different
reason.
During
my
time
spent
as
a
WA
for
a
VAST
course,
I
encountered
sophomore
students
who
were
generally
indifferent
to
the
idea
of
writing
papers.
They
were
being
taught
by
a
science
professor
who
did
not
seem
to
place
great
value
on
writing
or
care
very
much
about
their
papers.
There
was
also
a
wide
range
of
writing
aptitude
among
the
students,
and
I
think
this
was
a
cause
of
some
frustration
and
discomfort
during
conferences.
Some
students
were
internally
motivated
to
improve
their
papers,
and
these
individuals
were
more
likely
to
show
up
to
conferences
with
an
open
mind.
They
were
receptive
to
suggestions
and
eagerly
discussed
their
papers.
On
the
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum,
I
dealt
with
students
who
did
not
take
their
VAST
course
seriously
and
only
cared
about
getting
a
good
grade.
It
was
frustrating
to
work
with
these
students
because
they
did
not
respond
well
to
the
facilitative
approach.
They
were
more
likely
to
be
quiet
during
conferences
and
shrug
off
my
questions
and
suggestions.
I
learned
to
appreciate
the
students
who
were
intellectually
invested
in
their
papers.
My
most
rewarding
experience
as
a
WA
occurred
over
this
summer.
I
was
selected
to
WA
for
the
SPAL
program.
I
worked
with
ten
incoming
freshman
during
a
six-week
condensed
College
Writing
course.
During
this
time,
the
students
wrote
three
papers.
Obviously,
it
was
rather
hectic
finding
time
to
read
all
of
the
papers
and
to
schedule
conferences.
Yet
it
was
immensely
rewarding
to
work
with
these
students.
Because
I
also
spent
time
with
them
during
lunch
and
programs
that
I
helped
organize,
we
developed
strong
friendships.
And
when
it
came
to
WA
conferences,
the
students
took
my
advice
very
seriously
and
showed
much
appreciation
and
respect.
They
seemed
intimidated
by
the
depth
of
thought
expected
of
them
by
their
professor,
and
turned
to
me
with
their
questions
and
concerns.
They
had
never
had
WA
conferences
before
and
soon
learned
how
beneficial
it
could
be
to
discuss
their
ideas
with
another
person.
One
of
the
most
rewarding
moments
I
have
had
was
when
one
student
said,
NWow,
that
was
really
helpful.O
It
is
comforting
to
know
that
all
the
time
put
into
reading
many
essays
is
actually
helping
students
improve.
I
feel
as
though
my
work
as
a
WA
for
the
SPAL
program
gave
these
students
a
highly
favorable
first
impression
of
the
College
Writing
Program
as
a
whole.
The
experiences
I
have
had
over
the
past
year
have
helped
me
to
define
the
elusive
Nsuccessful
WA
conference.O
A
successful
WA
conference
is
one
in
which
both
the
WA
and
the
student
are
actively
engaged
in
the
pursuit
of
bettering
a
paper.
Prior
to
beginning
my
role
as
a
WA,
I
might
have
said
that
a
successful
WA
conference
is
more
results-focused,
but
through
experience
I
have
learned
that
the
process
of
exploring
a
paper
is
the
most
rewarding
part
of
a
conference.
Obviously,
the
point
of
a
conference
is
to
improve
a
studentOs
paper,
but
the
most
successful
WA
conferences
go
beyond
that
point.
When
a
student
and
the
WA
share
an
interest
in
making
a
paper
better,
the
conference
is
more
productive
and
intellectually
stimulating.
It
is
extremely
satisfying
to
see
a
student
empowered
by
a
new
idea
for
their
paper
or
an
alternative
direction
for
their
argument
to
pursue.
It
can
sometimes
feel
like
a
waste
of
time
if
I
have
read
a
paper
over
a
couple
of
times
and
written
suggestions
and
the
student
responds
with
apathy
or
just
simple
agreement.
When
the
two
individuals
work
together
to
fully
plumb
the
potential
depth
of
a
paper,
it
is
highly
rewarding
for
both
the
student
and
the
WA.
My
experience
as
a
WA
has
greatly
benefitted
my
own
writing.
After
reading
so
many
papers,
I
have
become
adept
at
recognizing
common
errors
and
stylistic
flaws
that
I
can
then
check
my
own
papers
for.
I
now
recognize
when
the
passive
voice
does
not
sound
academic
enough,
or
when
a
transition
is
needed
between
ideas.
Yet
primarily,
being
a
WA
has
taught
me
mostly
about
organization.
In
order
to
write
a
decent
paper,
it
is
crucial
that
the
information
logically
flows
and
presents
a
coherent
argument.
A
tip
that
has
helped
both
my
students
and
me
is
to
check
each
paragraph
for
its
overall
meaning
during
editing.
I
will
go
through
a
paper
and
write
a
few
words
beside
each
paragraph
summarizing
the
purpose
of
that
paragraph.
This
helps
me
assess
if
the
paper
is
progressing
in
a
way
that
makes
sense
and
that
ideas
are
not
being
repeated.
I
attribute
this
technique
to
being
a
WA.
Many
times
I
have
asked
a
student,
NSo,
whatOs
the
point
of
this
paragraph?O
and
be
met
with
a
confused
look.
Often
students
are
just
trying
to
fit
all
the
information
they
know
about
a
topic
into
their
paper
and
disregarding
the
need
for
organization.
By
forcing
them
to
identify
the
purpose
of
each
paragraph,
they
have
to
think
critically
about
the
presented
information
in
the
greater
context
of
the
paper.
This
technique
is
extremely
beneficial
to
the
organization
of
a
paper
and
is
one
that
I
utilize
often.
My
time
spent
as
a
WA
has
been
challenging
yet
rewarding.
I
have
worked
with
an
upper-level
Economics
class,
a
VAST
class,
and
the
SPAL
program.
The
College
Writing
Program
has
definitely
fostered
in
me
an
appreciation
for
the
facilitative
approach
to
conferencing.
I
also
have
learned
that
the
most
successful
WA
conferences
may
not
necessarily
be
one
in
which
a
paper
is
perfected,
but
one
in
which
the
student
thinks
critically
about
their
paper
and
the
topic.
On
a
more
personal
level,
this
year
has
taught
me
about
the
importance
of
a
well-organized
paper.
I
now
look
carefully
at
my
own
papers
to
make
sure
that
they
present
a
logical,
well-articulated
argument.
My
past
year
as
a
WA
has
been
a
time
of
much
intellectual
growth.
