rYour
handwriting
looks
like
chicken
scratch.s
My
mom
said
this
phrase
to
me
about
a
thousand
times
during
my
childhood.
I
knew
that
chicken
were
birds,
they
made
obnoxious
noises,
and
were
quite
tasty
dunked
in
apple
sauce.
I
did
not
know
what
business
a
chicken
had
holding
a
pencil,
or
whatever
any
of
this
rchicken
scratchs
nonsense
was.
Chickens
werenut
running
around
the
farm
trying
to
rewrite
Shakespeare
with
their
footprints,
so
I
didnut
see
how
this
comment
was
relevant.
I
was
an
average
first
grade
student.
I
liked
painting
rainbows
and
singing
along
to
Britney
Spears
without
understanding
her
sexual
innuendos.
But
the
bane
of
my
six
year
old
existence
was
writing,
because
writing
implied
handwriting
and
handwriting
required
precise
motor
skills
that
I
still
lack
at
eighteen.
All
the
first
grade
students
at
Manito
Elementary
were
given
a
Handwriting
Workbook
which
was
blue
and
essentially
the
spawn
of
Satan.
I
groaned
every
time
cheery
Ms.
Hellesto
would
have
us
whip
out
the
workbook
and
write
the
letter
Qi
eighty-six
times
in
a
row.
Qus
were
bad
because,
like
Ous,
I
had
to
make
a
perfect
circle
and
end
up
right
where
I
started.
Then
I
had
to
cross
a
line
through
it
at
just
the
right
angle.
Thatus
asking
too
much
from
the
group
of
kids
who
think
glue
is
a
food
group.
One
particular
letter
got
me
in
a
bit
of
trouble
with
my
mom.
When
a
rGs
popped
up
on
my
report
card
next
to
handwriting,
she
had
to
have
a
talk
with
me
about
practicing
penmanship.
Elementary
school
students
are
clearly
too
feint
at
heart
to
be
presented
with
the
real
alphabet,
so
we
werenut
given
the
basic
A,
B,
or
C
rating
in
a
subject.
Our
special,
less
honest
grades
were
E
for
Excellent,
V
for
Very
Good,
and
G
for
Good.
Good
having
the
meaning
of
not
good,
at
all.
Quite
inadequate,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
From
this
point
on,
writing
was
mathematic.
I
had
to
practice
writing
a
certain
amount
per
day
so
that
my
handwriting
would
move
from
illegible
to
slightly
decodable
by
the
end
of
fifth
grade.
Between
that
time,
sentences
moved
to
paragraphs.
I
have
no
recollection
of
what
I
wrote
about,
as
most
of
it
had
little
substance.
In
the
third
grade
we
were
only
allowed
to
eat
snack
once
we
wrote
fifteen
sentences
in
our
journals.
I
wrote
the
same
thing
every
day
because
by
ten
thirty
I
was
craving
those
chocolate
mini
muffins
in
my
backpack.
I
know
we
started
writing
longer
papers
and
essays
in
fourth
grade,
when
we
took
the
state
mandated
writing
exam
GEPA.
I
wasnut
held
back
so
I
figured
I
must
have
been
doing
alright,
but
never
really
thought
about
writing
as
a
skill.
There
are
only
two
things
about
writing
from
my
elementary
school
memories
that
stand
out:
typing
and
privacy.
Unfortunately,
those
two
things
were
at
odds
with
each
other.
As
bad
as
I
was
at
handwriting,
you
might
suspect
that
I
would
jump
at
the
chance
to
completely
skip
over
writing
with
a
pencil
and
type
everything
on
the
computer.
Ultimately
that
did
happen,
because
I
almost
never
handwrite
drafts
today.
In
second
and
third
grade
though,
my
typing
abilities
consisted
of
staring
at
the
keys
and
pressing
them
like
buttons
on
the
microwave.
This
process
took
hours
and
an
attention
span
that
I
didnut
possess.
Instead,
I
hand
wrote
drafts
of
my
papers
and
brought
them
home
for
my
mom
to
type.
She
was
given
only
one
condition.
She
wasnut
allowed
to
read
them.
I
had
some
privacy
issues
about
my
work,
like
any
great
writer
would,
so
in
order
to
make
perfectly
certain
my
mom
wasnut
reading
my
papers
while
she
typed
them
out,
I
dictated
them
aloud
to
her.
Based
on
eight
year
old
logic,
she
would
never
know
what
I
was
writing
about.
Paragraphs
moved
to
papers
in
middle
school.
We
wrote
about
dead
presidents
and
school
uniforms.
There
are
a
lot
of
dead
presidents
and
from
sixth
to
eighth
grade
someone
always
wants
to
debate
you
on
the
issue
of
school
uniforms,
for
whatever
reason.
English
then
was
a
breeze,
and
I
got
Aus
in
every
class
once
I
was
deemed
tough
enough
to
earn
them.
Probably
one
of
the
biggest
aides
to
my
writing
came
in
seventh
grade
when
I
downloaded
an
instant
messaging
program.
I
felt
connected
to
all
my
friends;
I
was
the
first
to
know
when
Becky
broke
up
with
Brian
and
Sam
had
to
shave
her
head
because
of
lice.
At
the
same
time
my
typing
ability
almost
replaced
my
speaking,
as
it
was
my
new
means
of
communication
with
all
my
peers.
Having
the
choice
to
type
something
out
and
edit
it
before
sending
is
something
my
generation
is
really
fortunate
to
have,
and
the
practice
typing
to
friends
made
me
feel
more
free
writing
essays.
The
only
thing
scarier
than
an
elementary
school
kid
going
to
middle
school
and
having
to
face
the
real
alphabet
on
report
cards
is
of
course
a
middle
school
kid
going
to
high
school
and
having
their
actual
faces
shoved
into
lockers.
My
guidance
counselor
warned
me
that
high
school
was
terrifying
and
would
eat
up
my
lunch
and
soul
if
wasnut
careful.
So
I
wanted
to
take
things
slowly
with
school
work
and
decided
to
sign
up
for
all
of
the
highest
level
classes
except
for
one.
I
chose
to
leave
out
English
because
I
thought
writing
about
dead
presidents
was
slightly
more
interesting
than
writing
about
school
uniforms,
selecting
to
take
honors
history
instead.
Skipping
honors
English
set
me
behind
all
the
other
honors
students
in
my
high
school,
made
me
unqualified
for
the
freshmen
honors
society,
and
damaged
my
GPA.
It
was
one
of
the
best
decisions
Iuve
ever
made.
Ms.
Henry
was
short,
spunky,
and
always
sat
on
top
of
her
desk
instead
of
in
her
chair.
I
never
would
have
met
her
if
I
didnut
take
regular
English,
and
I
would
have
missed
out
on
an
amazing
instructor.
I
was
a
little
disappointed
in
her
when
she
asked
us
to
write
about
school
uniforms,
but
she
showed
us
ways
to
research
our
own
information
and
ways
to
make
stronger
arguments
with
facts
in
a
full
paper.
She
also
had
us
write
creatively
and
never
hindered
anyoneus
expression.
Since
I
had
a
stronger
background
in
writing
than
the
other
students,
I
felt
very
open
to
trying
new
things
and
experimenting.
We
learned
in
high
school
that
five
paragraph
essays
needed
to
have
a
rgrabbers
in
the
opening
paragraph,
and
I
spent
hours
trying
to
think
of
artful
ways
to
draw
a
reader
into
a
paper
that
was
pretty
boring
after
that
first
sentence
anyway.
I
enjoyed
every
second
of
it
though,
and
it
led
me
to
take
more
challenging
courses
in
the
future.
High
school
puttered
along
and
I
knew
I
had
an
easier
time
writing
than
most
of
the
other
students.
I
was
getting
100us
on
every
paper,
even
rough
drafts
of
research
papers.
I
normally
didnut
give
writing
a
second
thought
because
I
was
so
focused
on
math
that
I
didnut
want
to
embrace
the
creative
mindset.
I
started
college
calculus
at
fifteen
and
finished
all
of
calc
before
even
graduating
high
school,
so
I
was
just
happy
I
didnut
have
to
waste
time
trying
too
hard
at
writing.
During
a
bored
summer
off
after
sophomore
year
I
saw
a
writing
competition
on
a
website
I
frequently
visited.
It
seemed
like
a
fun
challenge
so
I
entered,
even
though
it
was
fantasy
writing
which
I
never
tried
before.
Thirty
people
started
in
the
competition
and
I
lost
in
the
final
round,
coming
in
second
place.
I
started
to
like
this
whole
writing
thing,
and
gave
it
a
little
more
attention.
Junior
year
I
decided
to
take
the
ultimate
writing
challenge
at
Indian
Hills
High
School.
I
took
two
AP
classes
with
teachers
known
to
be
intense
about
their
writing
assignments.
I
was
warned
by
a
many
people
about
the
classes.
I
heard
a
lot
of
ryouull
have
to
take
days
off
to
finish
The
Roeser
Paper,s
ryou
wonut
sleep,s
and
the
very
true
rbuy
extra
pencils.s
Ms.
Roeser
taught
AP
Composition
at
my
high
school
since
the
dawn
of
time
and
was
known
for
assigning
at
least
two
essays
a
week,
on
top
of
a
yearlong
research
paper
rumored
to
be
the
equivalent
of
a
college
thesis-
about
150
pages
long.
At
one
point
the
paper
was
actually
over
the
100
page
mark,
but
in
recent
years
Ms.
Roeser
has
gotten
more
reasonable
and
set
the
guidelines
only
to
say
that
the
paper
has
to
be
at
least
25
pages.
The
Roeser
Paper
was
a
headache,
but
it
taught
me
almost
everything
I
needed
to
know
about
John
Steinbeck
and
college
writing.
Ms.
Roeser
was
a
little
bit
anal,
and
required
that
we
show
her
where
every
bit
of
information
from
the
paper
came
from.
That
included
me
submitting
a
five
inch
binder
full
of
all
my
research,
complete
with
sticky
notes
numbered
to
correspond
with
my
footnotes
that
were
at
the
end
of
almost
every
sentence.
Her
goal
was
simple.
She
wanted
to
show
that
when
ideas
arenut
your
own,
you
have
to
site
them,
every
last
detail.
On
one
spring
morning
while
I
was
walking
lazily
to
history,
I
was
stopped
abruptly
at
the
classroom
door.
rCan
I
ask
you
something,
Kelly?s
My
teacher,
Iull
call
her
Ms.
Gand
because
I
like
using
fake
names
for
people
if
Ium
going
to
say
something
less
than
super
about
them,
was
blocking
my
entrance.
rUh..
Sure.s
Ms.
Gand
had
a
bad
gap
tooth
that
was
regularly
stained
with
fifty
cent
lipstick.
I
took
a
glance
inside
and
saw
a
crate
full
of
my
classu
research
papers
and
I
had
a
dropping
feeling
in
my
bowls.
It
could
have
been
the
fake
cheese
tacos
from
lunch
kicking
in,
but
the
real
culprit
was
the
brewing
thought
in
my
mind.
The
one
big
fear
of
all
honors
studentsi
plagiarism.
Most
students,
in
fact
all
that
I
know,
wouldnut
consider
plagiarizing
ever,
but
the
reality
is
that
sometimes
you
reword
things
unknowingly,
and
paragraphs
match
up.
rWhat
is
it?s
I
replied
in
a
terrified
mutter.
rYour
research
paper
was
the
best
one
Iuve
read
in
all
my
years
teaching.
Would
you
mind
if
I
photocopied
it
and
sent
it
to
someone?
I
donut
want
to
copy
it
without
your
permission.s
Well,
it
was
the
best
of
both
worlds
for
me.
I
got
paid
the
highest
compliment
Iuve
ever
received
for
writing,
and
I
was
still
right.
It
was
about
plagiarism.
Ms.
Gand
was
known
for
ripping
students
apart,
so
the
conversation
was
extra
sweet.
Of
course,
to
have
ups
in
a
career
you
have
to
have
downs.
Some
of
the
worst
moments
in
my
writing
history
came
my
senior
year
of
high
school.
I
made
the
horrible
decision
to
take
an
online
class
and
the
even
worse
choice
to
make
the
online
class
French
5.
I
procrastinated
until
the
end
of
the
year
and
had
to
write
eleven
essays
on
various
topics,
in
French,
to
gain
credit
and
to
keep
my
position
in
the
National
French
Honor
Society.
I
spent
my
entire
spring
break
writing
essays
that
barely
got
passed,
and
was
once
accused
of
using
an
online
translator
because
the
work
was
so
poor.
Though
I
wouldnut
call
myself
even
nearly
proficient
in
the
language,
it
wasnut
really
my
lack
of
understanding
the
grammar
that
posed
such
a
challenge.
The
essays
were
just
questions
about
things
I
didnut
care
about,
and
I
wasnut
able
to
put
any
creative
flair
to
the
work
because
I
didnut
know
how
to
structure
humor
or
prose
in
French.
From
the
experience
I
realized
I
didnut
like
French
as
much
as
I
thought,
but
I
loved
English
even
more.
I
entered
college
as
a
potential
double
major
in
English
and
misery
(read:
Physics),
and
realized
after
the
first
semester
of
Mechanics
that
Physics
was
the
perfect
storm
of
boring
and
impossible.
Yet
majoring
in
English
is
actually
a
lot
of
fun.
I
donut
really
see
writing
papers
as
an
assignment
if
I
love
the
topic
enough,
and
Iuve
been
fortunate
to
get
professors
who
will
let
me
write
what
I
want
to
write.
The
research
process
makes
me
feel
like
Ium
discovering
something
new,
even
if
thousands
of
people
smarter
than
me
have
written
papers
better
than
me
on
the
topic.
I
was
nervous
when
I
started
my
college
writing
career
because
I
had
no
idea
where
I
stood
with
other
students.
At
the
first
chance
I
got
to
ask
a
teacher
if
my
writing
was
rcollege
levels
I
was
surprised
to
hear
that
it
was
on
par
with
expectations.
My
own
WA
told
me
there
wasnut
much
she
could
help
me
with,
and
Ium
still
shocked
that
Iuve
yet
to
get
less
than
an
A-
on
a
writing
assignment.
Though
the
most
shocking
of
all
my
college
writing
experiences
didnut
come
from
a
professor,
it
came
from
a
peer.
For
my
FYS
the
students
were
broken
up
into
groups
for
a
presentation,
and
four
of
us
were
plopped
down
on
the
comfy
contemporary
couches
of
Skillman
library.
rOk,
we
should
cover
the
morality
issue
firstis
my
group
mate
suggested.
rHold
on,
I
have
a
pen,
Iull
write
it
down.s
I
flipped
over
my
sheet
of
printer
paper
and
started
writing
down
the
presentation
order
slowly.
rWow!s
I
glanced
up.
My
group
mate
was
staring
at
my
paper.
rYour
handwriting
is
like...
Really
amazing.s
I
smiled
and
tried
to
chuckle
only
to
myself.
Without
lifting
my
head,
I
answered
her.
rThanks!s
I
paused.
rIuve
been
told
itus
good.s
