A
literary
narrative
The
chronicles
of
my
written
work
attest
to
the
fact
that
creativity
and
imagination
apparently
fled
my
being
around
the
same
time
that
puberty
overtook
it.
As
a
ten-year-old,
I
gave
life
to
bubblegum,
strawberries,
pencils
and
nickels
through
my
writing.
I
had
a
strange
ability
and
desire
to
personify
things
and
wrote
incessantly
about
this
theme.
Sammy,
a
piece
of
pink
Wrigley's,
stands
out
vividly
in
my
mind,
with
his
tribulations
of
being
stuck
in
the
pocket
of
a
little
boy's
jeans
and
then
thrown
into
the
washing
machine.
There
was
also
Betty,
the
strawberry,
who
experiences
the
horror
of
being
picked
ferociously
from
her
stem
amongst
the
strawberry
village,
then
is
separated
from
her
brother
and
thrown
into
a
small
green
basket.
From
there,
Betty
either
befriends
the
other
strawberries
in
her
pint
and
spends
the
rest
of
her
days
in
the
refrigerator,
or
she
meets
her
fatal
destiny
in
a
strawberry
rhubarb
pie.
Rarely
however,
do
I
remember
sharing
these
stories
with
anyone.
Passionate
and
creative,
I
was
also
reserved
and
private
and
writing
was
a
method
through
which
I
could
release
my
thoughts.
Before
I
began
to
write
in
school,
I
was
never
coaxed
into
or
pressured
to
write
at
home.
Expressing
my
thoughts
and
imagination
through
pen
and
paper
was
easy
for
me,
and
I
suppose
because
I
was
a
reserved
child,
writing
was
soothing
and
therapeutic
in
ways
I
did
not
understand
then.
My
imagination
was
most
prevalent
and
alive
when
I
could
channel
it
onto
paper.
In
the
first
through
fourth
grade
my
school
published
a
collection
of
students'
writing
called
Paw
Prints.
We
were
encouraged
to
write
short
stories,
poetry
or
essays
and
our
teachers
then
helped
to
submit
the
pieces
to
the
publication
that
was
handed
out
at
local
grocery
stores,
libraries
and
community
events.
It
was
a
fantastic
little
book
that
encouraged
kids
to
write
and
allowed
their
writing
to
be
exposed.
I
wrote
incessantly
for
that
little
book,
from
little
three
line
poems
about
my
brother's
smelly
feet
to
short
stories
about
alien
abductions
on
the
playground.
The
greatest
aspect
of
the
book,
looking
back
at
it
now
(I
of
course
have
saved
all
the
copies!)
is
the
lack
of
editing.
The
stories
and
poems
are
genuine
second-grade
writing,
loaded
with
spelling
mistakes,
missing
words
and
tangled
ideas.
For
me
it
represents
a
time
in
my
life
when
I
could
write
without
apprehension,
when
my
imagination
was
limitless.
The
key
to
imagination
however,
is
freedom
and
self-assurance.
In
middle
school,
my
creativity
especially
in
the
context
of
writing
was
conquered
by
adolescent
mayhem.
I
recall
being
given
many
creative
writing
tasks,
usually
at
the
beginning
of
class
to
get
our
minds
into
motion.
I
was
always
anxious
about
these
assignments.
We
were
to
write
about
anything
we
wanted,
and
I
remember
never
being
able
to
think
of
anything,
my
mind
becoming
blank.
A
good
five
out
of
the
ten
minutes
we
were
given
to
write
were
consumed
by
my
anxious
staring
at
the
empty
paper
in
front
of
me.
Those
assignments
spurred
my
hatred
for
free
writing.
I
hated
not
being
given
any
direction,
and
looking
back,
I
think
it
was
then
that
I
began
to
lose
my
creativity,
or
perhaps
I
just
distrusted
it.
I
developed
an
aversion
for
being
forced
to
write
creatively.
I
despised
when
teachers
gave
me
fifteen
minutes
in
class
to
write
a
poem
about
anything
I
wanted.
I
felt
restricted,
and
I
felt
that
forced
writing
defeated
the
purpose
of
creativity.
I
do
not
remember
receiving
much
praise
from
my
teachers
for
my
free
writing,
and
I
never
volunteered
to
share
my
samples
to
my
classmates.
Frustration
set
in
because
I
truly
did
love
to
write
creatively
on
my
own
time,
and
I
felt
that
I
had
trusted
and
encouraged
a
talent
that
did
not
exist.
Entering
high
school,
I
knew
internally
that
writing
was
a
strength
of
mine.
Nonetheless,
it
wasn't
until
I
really
began
to
receive
encouragement
and
praise
for
my
style
of
writing
from
several
high
school
teachers
that
I
accepted
my
ability.
Due
to
steady
acknowledgement
of
my
writing
strengths
by
teachers,
I
spent
time
on
developing
my
writing.
I
would
write
several
drafts
and
have
my
teachers
read
them
prior
to
the
paper's
due
date,
and
I
would
spend
the
time
I
should
have
been
spending
on
math
or
science
homework,
proofing
my
English
papers.
Unlike
most
high
school
freshman,
I
took
peer
editing
seriously.
I
liked
that
interaction,
I
enjoyed
receiving
the
feedback
and
I
liked
being
able
to
compare
my
writing
to
that
of
my
classmates.
My
weakness
in
creative
writing
followed
me
still
into
my
high
school
years.
I
had
a
difficult
time
writing
creative
short
stories
as
well
as
poetry,
and
admired
those
of
my
peers
who
excelled
at
this
type
of
writing.
My
forte
then
and
also
now
was
in
writing
essays
and
research
papers.
As
a
junior
in
High
School
I
was
required
to
write
two
twenty-page
research
papers,
one
for
the
English
department
and
one
for
the
History
department.
Each
semester
of
my
junior
year
in
both
of
these
courses
was
dedicated
to
producing
these
papers.
Although
it
was
the
first
time
writing
something
of
such
great
length,
I
remember
feeling
that
my
teachers
were
holding
my
hand
too
tightly
through
the
process.
The
length
did
not
trouble
me,
nor
did
the
organization
process.
I
wrote
a
brief
biography
of
Truman
Capote
and
also
a
criticism
of
two
of
his
major
works.
For
my
history
requirement
I
wrote
about
Native
Americans
and
their
involvement
in
the
running
of
several
casinos
as
a
means
of
financial
security.
What
I
found
through
writing
both
of
these
papers
was
my
interest
in
researching
and
my
ease
at
organizing
such
broad
topics.
I
received
very
positive
comments
on
both
papers,
but
was
also
informed
that
I
needed
to
work
on
some
grammatical
aspects
of
my
writing,
particularly
the
placement
and
use
of
commas.
The
process
of
writing
both
of
these
lengthy
papers
in
high
school
initiated
me
to
what
would
later
be
expected
of
me
in
college.
I
have
produced
similar
papers
since,
with
the
same
ease
and
organizational
qualities,
but
incessantly
receive
the
comma
comment.
This
grammatical
bad
habit
continues
to
weaken
the
flow
and
appearance
of
my
writing
today.
As
a
junior
in
college,
I
still
am
having
meetings
with
English
professors
about
how
to
use
commas.
It
is
sometimes
embarrassing,
but
mainly
just
frustrating,
as
teachers
acknowledge
my
positive
writing
abilities,
but
the
grammatical
errors
harshly
interfere
with
the
quality
of
my
writing,
as
well
as
the
level
of
my
grade.
As
an
English
and
Spanish
Literature
double
major,
I
have
done
a
great
deal
of
writing
at
Lafayette.
Most
of
my
writing
has
been
either
research
papers
or
literary
critical
analysis
in
both
English
and
Spanish.
I
feel
as
though
my
writing
is
improving
extremely
slowly,
almost
as
though
I
hit
a
peak
around
my
freshman
year
in
college,
and
have
maintained
a
steady
quality
that
is
neither
exceptional
nor
poor.
I
do
receive
positive
comments
from
professors,
that
I
write
well
am
perceptive,
persuasive
in
my
critical
analysis
and
that
my
overall
style
is
impressive.
However,
I
do
not
feel
as
though
I
have
exerted
enough
effort
to
improve
my
weaknesses.
Every
semester
I
internally
urge
myself
to
take
a
creative
writing
course,
but
am
afraid
that
I
will
hit
the
same
blank
wall
I
ran
into
when
I
was
in
middle
school.
I
love
to
read
poetry,
and
try
to
write
my
own,
but
am
overly
self-conscious
about
it
and
do
not
trust
any
creativity
that
somehow
seeps
through
me
onto
paper.
I
have
not
pushed
nor
encouraged
myself
enough
to
write
in
unconventional
ways.
Journals
are
even
difficult
for
me
to
write,
although
I
do
attempt
them.
I
am
confident
in
proclaiming
that
I
have
a
writing
talent,
but
I
do
not
see
it
going
anywhere.
I
can
write
a
college
essay
with
little
struggle,
however
I
wish
that
the
ounce
of
creativity
that
lives
inside
me
would
reveal
itself
in
these
essays
to
make
them
stronger
and
more
alive.
I
feel
as
though
my
writing,
although
well
organized,
and
perhaps
persuasive,
is
at
times
very
dry
and
standard.
My
goal
is
to
take
more
risks
with
my
writing,
to
be
more
uninhibited
like
I
was
as
a
ten-year-old
writer,
and
also
of
course
to
fix
my
comma
crisis.

History
as
a
Writer
Human
beings
have
spent
millions
of
years
establishing,
altering,
and
perfecting
a
form
of
oral
and
written
communication.
This
means
of
expression
has
been
handed
down
and
changed
through
generations;
often
studied
and
mastered
by
individuals
in
a
society.
This
is
obviously
not
my
last
essay
of
my
lifetime;
nor
am
I
even
close
to
a
master
of
written
communication.
One
may
even
argue
as
to
whether
my
writing
has
even
improved
since
the
stories
I
created
in
kindergarten.
I
would
like
to
think,
however,
that
the
hundreds
of
hours
I
have
spent
in
English
class
writing
short
stories,
poems,
articles
and
research
papers
have
had
some
type
of
a
positive
impact
on
my
written
communication
skills.
Nevertheless,
my
writing
has
been
influenced
by
several
people,
classes
and
situations
over
the
past
nineteen
years;
transforming
my
mechanics,
style,
and
even
my
preferences
dramatically.
As
a
child,
my
love
of
reading
was
fostered
by
my
parents
and
relatives.
My
father
is
a
publisher
and
often
brought
home
books
from
his
office
for
my
brother
and
sister
and
me.
Bedtime
was
always
preceded
by
story
time
and
when
our
books
were
done,
I
always
begged
for
"just
one
more
story."
Although
I
recognize
the
fact
that
this
was
probably
one
of
my
many
attempt
to
postpone
the
inevitable
"lights
out,"
I
always
did
enjoy
being
read
to
and
later
reading
books
on
my
own.
I
was
not
old
enough
to
write
at
the
time,
but
I
spent
car
rides
and
long
waits
in
line
creating
and
acting
out
stories
with
my
sibling.
In
grade
school,
my
love
of
reading
continued
and
I
also
became
very
interested
in
writing
and
illustrating
my
own
stories.
One
of
my
earliest
memories
of
"formal"
writing
is
a
book
we
created
in
third
grade.
Each
child
in
the
class
was
to
write,
edit,
and
illustrate
a
story.
We
eventually
bound
the
pages
and
we
each
had
an
actual
book
that
we
had
created
ourselves.
Although
I
enjoyed
creating
my
very
own
book
I
also
was
beginning
to
consider
writing
a
burden.
It
was
not
the
actual
writing
that
I
minded,
but
rather
the
process
that
went
along
with
it.
I
always
dreaded
all
of
the
peer-editing
and
rewriting.
I
was
happy
with
my
story
the
first
time
and
found
any
changing
of
the
story
and
rewriting
to
be
monotonous
and
burdensome.
Still,
I
did
enjoy
the
creative
outlet
and
liked
to
write
on
my
own
time
when
I
did
not
have
to
be
bothered
with
the
formal
process.
One
thing
I
particularly
enjoyed
was
writing
in
our
journals
in
school.
This
journal
writing
gave
me
a
chance
to
express
myself
without
worrying
about
the
"i
before
e
rule"
or
remembering
a
period
at
the
end
of
the
sentence.
Most
of
the
writing
I
did
in
this
journal
and
at
home
was
fictional
stories
involving
talking
animals
who
often
found
themselves
to
be
in
the
same
predicaments
I
was
once
in.
Another
type
of
writing
I
became
involved
with
at
this
time
was
play
writing.
At
large
family
gatherings
it
literally
became
a
ritual
for
my
cousins
and
my
sibling
and
me
to
write
a
script,
create
scenery
and
costume,
and
act
out
the
play
for
our
family.
Again,
these
plays
often
involved
characters
who
faced
problems
extremely
similar
to
my
own
or
remarkably
similar
to
problems
faced
by
characters
in
books
that
I
had
read.
My
relatives
proved
to
be
a
good
audience
for
my
plays,
always
providing
praise
and
acclaim
for
all
of
our
work.
My
teachers
in
school
echoed
similar
words
of
approval
for
the
work
of
my
classmates
and
myself
and
their
editing
of
our
writing
was
usually
limited
to
mechanical
errors.
After
years
of
uncriticized
writing,
fifth
grade
with
Mr.
Basiak
was
certainly
a
surprise.
This
was
my
first
class
in
elementary
school
when
I
was
not
required
to
write
in
a
journal.
In
fact
fictional
writing
became
a
thing
of
the
past
as
we
focused
on
state
reports
and
diagramming
sentences.
Next
to
my
father,
Mr.
Basiak
has
had
the
largest
impact
on
my
writing.
I
believe
that
it
was
in
this
class
where
I
could
first
be
considered
a
"good"
writer.
While
the
other
fifth
grade
classes
were
learning
to
read
and
write
through
the
whole-language
approach,
we
were
learning
about
predicate
nominative
and
objects
of
prepositions.
I
learned
more
about
grammar
in
fifth
grade
than
most
of
my
classmates
learned
thorough
out
their
four
years
in
high
school
and
I
feel
that
this
gave
me
an
edge
over
others
in
later
years
and
sometimes
even
today.
Along
with
grammar,
Mr.
Basiak
introduced
me
to
another
aspect
of
writing
which
would
change
my
work
forever--
criticism.
Although
he
encouraged
us
to
read
and
write,
not
all
of
our
writing
attempts
were
hailed
as
perfect
or
flawless.
All
of
a
sudden
I
did
not
find
peer-editing
to
be
so
burdensome
or
rewriting
to
be
such
a
hassle.
When
I
asked
my
father
to
edit
my
papers
for
school
I
pushed
him
to
point
out
all
my
mistakes
he
could
find,
knowing
that
if
he
did
not,
Mr.
Basiak
would.
It
was
during
this
time
when
my
father
began
to
play
a
larger
role
in
my
writing.
Not
only
was
he
often
the
first
editor
of
my
paper,
but
I
began
to
feel
as
though
he
influenced
my
grades;
a
serious
consideration
of
mine.
Although
he
never
had
more
than
a
few
changes,
I
often
felt
that
if
handed
in
a
paper
before
he
had
corrected
it
I
would
surely
never
receive
an
A.
This
reliance
on
my
father's
criticism
continued
through
intermediate
school,
when
our
writing
again
focused
on
the
more
informative
styles
of
writing,
such
a
book
reports,
rather
then
on
creative
writing
such
as
story
telling.
Like
Mr.
Basiak's
class,
sixth
grade
was
another
influential
year
with
regards
to
my
writing.
It
was
in
sixth
grade
when
we
were
exposed
to
different
forms
of
writing
including
persuasive
writing,
letter
writing,
professional
writing
and
even
poetry.
I
found
our
course
on
poetry
to
be
very
exciting
and
different
than
anything
I
had
been
involved
with
before
and
I
loved
it.
I
again
started
writing
at
home
for
the
first
time
since
grade
school
and
enjoying
the
new
type
of
written
expression
recently
exposed
to
me.
To
this
day,
poetry
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
forms
of
writing
although
I
rarely
write
during
my
own
time.
Seventh
and
eighth
grade
writing
consisted
mainly
of
book
reports
or
fact
essays
which
by
now
were
becoming
fairly
routine
and
easy
for
me.
I
found
myself
no
longer
enjoying
the
writing
I
was
doing
for
school
but
instead
wrote
for
the
soul
purpose
of
receiving
a
good
grade.
I
was
always
happy
with
the
grades
I
received
on
my
essays
and
my
teachers
seemed
pleased
with
the
work
I
was
turning
in.
Even
in
English
class
I
was
rarely
criticized
for
my
written
work.
I
learned
what
each
teacher
was
looking
for
and
I
could
construct
my
essays
to
please
each
individual.
My
papers
did
not
have
much
style,
but
rather
followed
the
form
I
was
taught
and
I
knew
my
teachers
were
looking
for.
In
high
school
I
think
my
writing
took
another
dramatic
turn
because
I
could
no
longer
follow
the
form
five-paragraph
essay
that
had
been
drilled
into
my
head
for
the
past
three
years.
I
certainly
was
not
prepared
for
the
failing
grade
I
receive
on
my
first
English
paper
of
freshmen
year.
After
crying
for
an
hour
or
so
I
realized
that
it
was
not
my
actual
writing
which
was
bad,
but
rather,
the
format
that
I
had
used.
After
several
more
days
in
the
class,
I
was
quickly
able
to
figure
out
what
this
teacher
was
looking
for
and
adapted
my
writing
to
receive
above
average
grades
the
rest
of
the
semester.
It
was
around
this
time
when
my
father
began
pressing
me
to
develop
a
style
of
writing.
He
realized
that
I
was
happy
with
the
grades
I
was
getting
and
that
I
really
did
not
have
any
desire
to
change
the
way
I
was
writing
when
what
I
had
been
doing
was
working
so
well.
He
explained
to
me
however,
that
just
because
I
got
good
grades
does
not
necessarily
mean
it
was
good
writing.
I
understood
what
he
was
explaining
but
was
not
ready
to
exert
the
extra
energy
and
spend
the
time
to
develop
this
"style"
which
apparently
was
not
necessary
to
appease
my
teachers.
My
dad,
however,
continued
to
pressure
me
to
work
on
each
essay,
always
pointing
out
where
my
writing
became
dull
and
form-like
and
where
things
needed
to
be
changed.
Eventually,
my
writing
began
to
evolve
and
although
I
still
find
myself
striving
to
write
the
essay
that
I
think
my
professor
is
looking
for,
I
also
spend
time
making
sure
that
when
I
read
it,
I
can
tell
that
I
have
written
it.
During
my
senior
year
in
high
school,
my
English
class
focused
on
preparing
us
for
the
A.P.
English
test.
It
seemed
to
me
throughout
that
year
that
my
writing
had
regressed.
After
spending
so
much
time
trying
to
get
away
from
the
form-like
essays
we
had
used
earlier,
we
were
again
trained
to
cater
our
writing
style
to
that
which
the
test
graders
are
looking
for.
Although
we
did
not
return
to
the
five-paragraph
essay,
we
did
learn
a
similarly
simplistic
type
of
essay
guaranteed
to
receive
a
high
score
on
the
A.
P.
test.
Senior
year
writing
was
also
unique
in
that
it
was
the
first
time
I
had
done
any
creative
writing
since
grade
school.
While
preparing
to
write
essays
for
our
college
applications,
our
teachers
stressed
that
the
essays
should
be
as
creative
as
possible,
so
that
ours
would
stick
out
from
the
thousands
of
other
essays
the
schools
received.
This
was
a
great
challenge
to
me;
to
create
an
essay
that
was
formal
and
creative
at
the
same
time.
I
know
that
my
writing
is
not
naturally
humorous
and
I
felt
to
force
that
humor
would
be
more
costly
than
beneficial.
Instead
I
tried
to
be
as
creative
as
possible
without
sacrificing
the
professional
approach
that
I
felt
was
necessary
for
the
occasion.
When
preparing
for
college,
I
was
unsure
as
to
what
to
expect
with
regards
to
my
writing
skills.
Receiving
a
high
score
on
the
A.P.
English
test
made
me
hopeful
that
my
writing
was
at
least
at
"college
level,"
whatever
that
meant.
My
writing
in
high
school
had
always
seemed
at
least
satisfactory
in
my
honors
courses
and
other
than
my
lack
of
style,
I
had
never
received
any
major
criticism
concerning
my
work.
So
although
I
feared
the
vast
volumes
of
pages
I
would
be
forced
to
write,
I
was
fairly
certain
that
my
writing
itself
was
at
least
up
to
par.
One
day
however,
I
realized
that
in
college,
my
father
would
no
longer
be
available
every
night
to
review
and
edit
each
of
my
writing
assignment.
For
weeks
I
seriously
considered
e-mailing
home
each
of
my
assignments,
but
eventually
realized
that
it
was
time
for
me
to
stop
relying
on
my
dad's
comments
and
suggestions
and
I
needed
to
learn
how
to
edit
my
own
writing.
This
idea,
however,
certainly
did
not
come
without
reservation.
This
reservation
and
uncertainty,
however,
proved
to
be
unnecessary
as
I
began
my
classes
at
Lafayette.
Not
only
did
I
realize
that
my
writing
was
adequate
without
my
father's
changes,
but
I
was
often
surprised
with
how
much
my
writing
was
actually
praised.
In
fact,
many
of
my
new
friends
began
coming
to
me
to
edit
their
essays;
something
which
I
certainly
not
expect
but
was
happy
to
oblige.
By
correcting
the
essays
of
others,
I
was
able
to
better
recognize
the
same
mistakes
in
my
own
writing.
Also
through
this
experience,
I
learned
that
although
my
father
often
had
numerous
corrections
or
"suggestions"
about
my
writing,
it
did
not
mean
that
my
writing
was
wrong
or
bad.
It
simply
meant
that
my
dad
and
I
might
have
different
tastes
in
writing.
Similarly,
when
editing
the
writing
of
others,
I
found
it
necessary
to
remember
that
there
are
several
different
but
correct
ways
to
express
a
thought.
And
even
if
I
did
not
agree
with
the
manner
in
which
something
was
written,
it
does
not
mean
that
it
was
written
incorrectly.
My
first
year
seminar
also
provided
me
with
tremendous
confidence
in
my
writing
skills.
My
professor
praised
each
paper
I
completed
and
he
was
constantly
commending
me
on
the
assignments
I
did
for
his
class.
On
the
other
hand,
his
class
has
also
helped
me
to
recognize
some
of
my
major
setbacks
as
a
writer.
For
example,
I
now
recognize
that
I
often
assume
when
I
am
writing
that
the
reader
is
thinking
the
same
way
I
am.
I
sometimes
fail
to
completely
explain
my
ideas
and
instead
simply
leave
off
the
details
of
the
complex
thoughts
which
I
am
trying
to
explain.
By
editing
my
own
papers
I
have
come
to
recognize
many
other
problems
I
often
experience
as
a
writer.
Simple
things
like
being
sure
the
entire
paragraph
is
based
on
the
introductory
sentence
are
errors
that
I
recognize
when
reading
over
and
scrutinizing
my
papers.
My
first
year
seminar
is
only
one
class
which
required
me
to
do
a
great
deal
of
writing.
My
psychology
lab
course
and
my
philosophy
courses
also
required
many
papers
or
essays.
Because
I
had
to
do
so
much
writing
for
so
many
different
professors,
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
find
one
technique
or
"form
essay"
which
would
be
adequate
for
each.
Instead,
I
found
myself
finally
beginning
to
develop
the
style
about
which
my
father
had
spent
years
lecturing
me.
On
the
other
hand,
I
also
became
more
focused
on
asking
each
professor
exactly
how
he
or
she
wanted
his
paper
completed.
I
believe
this
simple
task
is
what
ultimately
led
to
my
success
during
my
freshmen
year.
Too
many
times
I
saw
someone
receive
a
poor
grade
simply
because
he
did
not
follow
directions.
It
is
hard
for
us
as
students
to
write
up
lab
reports
simply
stating
the
facts
that
are
requested.
For
the
past
eight
years
we
have
been
taught
to
add
detail
and
explanation
to
our
writing.
Realizing
this
helped
me
to
write
well
in
psychology
where
the
type
of
report
and
style
of
writing
was
different
than
any
I
had
ever
experienced
before.
This
new
adaptability
has
had
a
profound
influence
on
my
writing
in
other
classes
as
well.
With
at
least
three
more
years
left
in
college
and
perhaps
several
more
in
graduate
school,
I
am
certain
that
my
writing
will
change
drastically
over
the
next
few
years;
just
as
it
has
in
the
past.
With
new
classes
and
new
professors,
I
will
have
new
and
different
sources
of
criticism
and
feedback
which
I
look
forward
to
with
the
hopes
of
becoming
a
better
writer.
One
of
my
goals
right
now
as
a
writer
is
to
continue
developing
my
own
sense
of
style
and
learning
to
incorporate
that
style
into
every
type
of
writing
in
which
I
engage.
Another
goal
of
mine
is
to
begin
writing
more
on
my
own
time
and
to
find
types
of
writing,
such
as
poetry,
which
I
enjoy
doing.
I
have
learned
that
the
best
way
to
improve
your
writing
is
to
write
as
much
as
possible.
If
I
am
a
writing
associate
again
next
year
I
hope
that
I
have
a
lot
of
new
experiences
to
elaborate
upon
as
beneficial
to
my
writing
skills.
