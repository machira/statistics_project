A
Year
in
the
Life
of
a
NWAO
If
someone
had
told
me
as
a
first
semester
freshman
at
Lafayette
that
I
would
go
on
to
become
a
WA
and
have
some
kind
of
passion
for
writing
I
would
have
literally
laughed
in
their
face.
However
over
the
past
year,
I
have
clearly
transformed
from
a
math
and
science
guru
who
loved
numbers
and
equations
to
someone
who
favors
writing
as
both
an
art
and
a
crucial
part
of
the
academic
world.
I
could
ask
myself
if
it
was
solely
my
experience
as
a
writing
associate
(WA)
that
instilled
this
change
of
interests
within
me.
I
feel
that
the
job
had
a
significant
impact
in
my
altered
interests
but
the
experiences
I
have
had
within
the
last
year
outside
of
being
a
WA
have
also
been
large
contributors.
In
other
words,
academic
writing
including
both
my
duties
as
a
WA
and
my
own
class
work
have
combined
with
the
more
informal
writing
I
have
taken
up
over
the
last
twelve
months
to
advance
my
interest
in
writing.
My
experiences
as
a
WA
in
particular
though,
can
now
be
used
in
the
form
of
advice
to
new
incoming
WAs
and
will
help
to
make
me
a
better
WA
and
writer
in
the
future.
My
first
experience
as
a
WA
was
in
Professor
WinfieldOs
FYS
on
community
service
and
involvement
last
fall
semester.
Although
I
had
no
past
experiences
with
either
Professor
Winfield
or
community
service,
my
roommate
had
had
this
FYS
which
revolved
around
the
Easton
community
as
a
freshman
and
I
therefore
knew
the
basics
of
what
the
class
was
about
and
the
types
of
assignments
it
included.
It
was
a
fairly
standard
FYS
with
three
major
papers
which
Professor
Winfield
and
I
agreed
would
fit
well
into
a
conference
schedule
with
three
individual
conferences
and
a
group
conference
on
the
final
paper.
This
group
conference
served
as
a
way
for
classmates
to
share
their
ideas
for
the
assignment
before
putting
pen
to
paper
and
actually
writing
it;
a
brainstorming
session
if
you
will.
The
major
problem
I
ran
into
in
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
was
being
able
to
effectively
communicate
with
my
partner
professor.
Although
we
admittedly
got
along
very
well
and
were
able
to
effectively
discuss
particular
studentsO
writing
and
the
goals
for
assignments,
Professor
Winfield
was
very
hard
to
get
in
touch
with.
I
would
always
eventually
get
in
touch
with
her,
but
oftentimes
after
countless
attempts
of
e-mailing,
calling,
and
visiting
a
locked
door
during
supposed
office
hours.
This
lack
of
availability
on
my
partner
professorOs
end
led
to
difficulties
in
constant
communication
between
I
as
a
WA
and
she
as
a
professor;
communication
which
after
a
year
in
the
position
I
feel
is
optimal.
As
veteran
WA,
I
do
plan
on
trying
to
lend
a
hand
when
needed
and
helping
out
the
new
WAs
this
year
because
I
remember
how
helpful
it
was
for
me
last
year
to
be
Nwelcomed
to
the
clubO
by
my
experienced
co-workers.
In
relation
to
my
first
assignment,
I
will
advise
new
WAs
to
avoid
prejudging
their
partner
professors
or
the
class
they
are
assigned.
Not
giving
the
professor
or
class
a
fair
chance
is
something
I
definitely
did
as
a
first-semester
WA
due
to
my
roommateOs
previous
experiences
with
my
partner
professor.
Even
though
rumors
new
WAs
may
have
heard
about
the
professor
or
the
way
he
or
she
runs
their
class
and
assignments
may
turn
out
to
be
true,
as
they
were
for
the
most
part
in
my
situation,
there
is
not
any
hurt
in
waiting
to
find
out
for
yourself.
Even
if
someone
has
had
a
professor
for
a
different
class,
or
for
that
matter
been
a
student
in
the
particular
class
they
are
assigned
to,
the
class
and
assignments
may
be
restructured
and
in
many
ways
unlike
any
preconceived
notions
would
have
them
expect.
So
when
a
new
WA
gets
their
first
assignment,
I
would
warn
them
to
avoid
complaining
about
it
or
making
it
an
issue
before
they
have
their
first
experience
with
the
class
and
meet
their
partner
professor.
The
spring
semester
presented
a
different
situation
as
I
worked
with
fellow
members
of
the
class
of
2012
enrolled
in
Professor
NestorOs
VAST
which
featured
an
intellectual
property
theme.
At
first
the
idea
of
working
with
more
advanced
writers
and
classmates
seemed
a
bit
scary.
Why
should
people
my
own
age
or,
in
most
cases,
older
than
me
respect
my
opinion
on
their
writing?
And
additionally,
why
would
the
students
in
this
VAST
class
trust
advice
from
myself,
a
liberal
arts
student,
on
papers
written
about
subjects
like
engineering
which
I
know
little
to
nothing
about?
As
it
turned
out,
I
had
no
problems
working
with
second
semester
sophomores
and
the
fact
that
they
had
more
advanced
writing
abilities
in
the
majority
of
instances
made
my
job
somewhat
easier.
Conferences
with
friends
and
teammates
seemed
to
be
even
easier
for
me
to
conduct
because
I
knew
these
students
outside
of
writing
conferences
so
they
not
only
took
the
conferences
and
my
advice
seriously,
but
the
constant
contact
with
these
individuals
outside
of
the
WA
room
allowed
us
to
talk
about
papers
more
than
just
during
scheduled
conference
times.
This
second
assignment
seemed
to
be
significantly
easier
than
the
previous
one
also
because
of
my
semester
of
experience.
Admittedly,
everything
always
seems
to
be
easier
once
you
have
some
experience
doing
it
but
I
noticed
several
other
reasons
which
helped
things
go
smoother
with
the
new
partner
professor,
particularly
the
preparation
on
Professor
NestorOs
end.
He
had
a
syllabus
ready
for
me
to
look
over
during
the
first
week
of
the
semester
so
I
knew
right
away
what
the
assignments
would
be
and
during
what
time
of
the
semester
I
would
need
to
hold
conferences.
This
allowed
me
to
plan
accordingly
for
my
own
activities
and
school
work
well
in
advance
of
the
four
rounds
of
conferences.
Professor
Nestor
was
also
very
good
with
responding
to
e-mails
or
phone
calls
and
constantly
discussing
assignments
and
issues
with
him
helped
things
on
both
of
our
ends
to
run
smoothly
with
minimal
issues.
He
always
encouraged
and
sometimes
requested
I
drop
in
and
see
him
during
his
office
hours
and
I
took
advantage
of
the
invitation
several
times.
Another
experience
I
had
in
both
the
fall
and
spring
was
holding
different
kinds
of
conferences.
In
the
fall
I
facilitated
group
conferences
and
then
in
the
spring
I
was
able
to
have
two
different
experiences
with
conferences
on
alternate
media.
I
had
individual
conferences
on
PowerPoint
presentations
with
the
VAST
I
was
assigned
to,
and
the
WA
for
my
own
VAST
class
actually
conducted
group
conferences
with
my
classmates
and
I
on
web
pages
that
we
had
designed.
Something
I
would
therefore
advise
New
WAs
on
based
on
my
year
of
experience
is
to
be
open
to
holding
all
kinds
of
conferences.
Although
the
standard
1-on-1
conference
on
a
writing
assignment
is
definitely
needed
during
the
semester,
there
are
several
possibilities
which
can
be
discussed
as
options
with
partner
professors.
For
example,
some
classes
have
only
one
or
two
papers.
Conferencing
more
than
once
on
a
paper
is
certainly
an
option,
but
if
there
are
supplementary
assignments
such
as
a
presentation
or
a
speech
that
accompany
the
paper,
conferences
can
definitely
be
held
on
these.
New
WAs
should
know
that
different
medias
can
be
combined
with
options
of
individual
or
group
conferences
to
perhaps
help
get
the
four
required
conferences
completed
within
the
semester
timeframe.
Being
a
WA
for
me
is
more
than
about
helping
the
students,
although
that
is
the
reason
I
am
employed.
I
have
learned
several
important
things
as
a
WA,
the
most
important
of
which
is
time
management.
It
did
not
take
long
as
a
beginning
WA
to
realize
how
hard
it
can
be
to
balance
school
and
a
job.
Four
times
each
semester,
for
about
a
week
at
a
time,
I
practically
lived
in
Pardee.
This
was
not
because
the
building
has
comfortable
furniture
(even
though
the
sofas
are
pretty
amazing),
but
because
it
was
what
I
had
to
do
to
get
student
writers
my
feedback
in
conferences
while
keeping
up
with
my
own
various
class
work
and
outside
activities.
This
goes
back
to
the
point
of
how
important
it
is
at
the
beginning
of
the
semester
to
outline
a
plan
with
your
partner
professor.
As
advice
to
incoming
WAs,
I
would
lie
if
I
said
the
time
management
part
of
the
job
is
easy,
but
communication
can
certainly
help
you
avoid
making
it
worse.
It
is
such
an
advantage
to
be
able
to
plan
out
the
large
events
in
your
semester
during
the
first
few
weeks.
Knowing
the
expectations
of
your
professor
and
the
basics
of
the
assignments
will
allow
you
to
be
able
to
plan
what
assignments
you
can
conference
on
and
when
those
four
rounds
will
take
place.
So
many
people
have
told
me
that
the
most
important
things
you
learn
while
in
college
are
not
directly
related
to
what
you
learn
in
the
classroom.
And
that
is
definitely
true
as
being
a
WA
has
forced
me
to
learn
to
time
manage
my
life
even
beyond
the
level
I
had
before
committing
to
the
job.
A
final
key
contributing
factor
to
my
Nwriting
revivalO
is
the
amount
of
free
writing
I
have
taken
up.
I
never
knew
how
stimulating
and
satisfactory
jotting
down
thoughts
on
certain
things
happening
in
my
life
could
be.
Starting
in
the
winter,
I
have
been
writing
things
down
in
instances
when
I
have
strong
feelings
about
an
issue.
Or
when
something
fairly
large
in
my
life
comes
up
I
will
jot
down
how
I
feel
about
it
or
simply
compose
a
note
on
the
computer.
This
has
helped
me
remember
my
previous
thoughts
when
the
issue
comes
back
again
or
when
I
think
of
it
at
a
later
point
in
time
and
possibly
add
to
the
previous
writing.
This
not
only
relates
to
my
experiences
as
a
writer
but
it
can
have
something
to
do
with
my
duties
as
a
WA.
For
example
I
may
be
sitting
in
class
one
day
taking
notes
and
all
of
a
sudden
something
that
I
write
down
in
my
notebook
will
relate
to
the
papers
I
have
been
conferencing
on.
I
would
most
likely
underline
or
highlight
this
information
and
later
reference
it,
possibly
in
a
conference,
to
help
a
student
with
his
or
her
paper.
This
kind
of
informal
writing
is
something
new
in
the
last
eight
or
ten
months
for
me
but
it
is
a
habit
I
have
fortunately
acquired.
As
a
reflection
on
the
job
of
a
writing
associate,
I
do
feel
like
it
can
be
a
very
rewarding
position.
Both
semesters
I
saw
significant
improvements
in
the
writing
of
that
class
as
a
whole.
There
were
obviously
some
students
who
advanced
their
skills
much
further
than
others,
and
I
noticed
that
these
students
were
most
often
the
ones
who
made
it
their
goal
to
get
something
out
of
their
conferences
and
came
to
see
me
with
their
own
questions
for
the
conference
which
made
my
job
significantly
easier.
The
appreciation
of
my
partner
professors
for
the
work
I
did
also
made
me
feel
good,
and
the
potential
relationships
I
feel
that
can
be
developed
with
faculty
as
a
WA
are
great
ways
in
into
bigger
and
better
things.
I
have
found
that
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
and
encouraging
parts
of
being
a
WA
are
the
conferences
themselves.
Gradually
noticing
improvements,
as
indicated
in
the
previous
paragraph,
was
certainly
rewarding.
But
before
my
first
conferences,
I
never
imagined
how
the
conversations
I
would
have
with
these
students
would
give
me
so
much
information.
Reading
papers,
as
boring
as
it
can
be
depending
on
the
student
writer,
oftentimes
supplies
me
with
seemingly
endless
information
I
never
would
have
discovered
without
reading
the
papers.
And
asking
the
student
writers
to
explain
what
they
meant
by
something
or
to
expand
on
a
point
in
their
own
words
often
led
to
conversations
between
the
two
of
us
which
did
not
directly
relate
to
their
paper
but
instead
helped
both
of
us
understand
a
particular
point
better
which
could
then
be
translated
into
improvement
in
the
writing.
These
particular
in
depth
conversations
with
the
writers
fed
my
own
curiosity
while
often
either
directly
or
circuitously
assisting
the
student
with
their
writing.
My
job
as
a
WA
has
also
made
me
think
further
about
getting
into
some
kind
of
writing
or
journalism
profession
after
graduation,
something
I
most
likely
would
not
have
considered
as
a
freshman.
I
recently
interviewed
for
a
job
with
an
academic
journal
and
I
feel
that
my
experience
as
a
WA
may
give
me
an
advantage
in
the
selection
process.
I
have
also
begun
reading
much
more
frequently
in
the
last
year,
mainly
because
of
my
acquired
curiosity
about
authorsO
styles
and
motivation
for
writing.
As
a
WA,
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
see
so
many
different
kinds
of
writing
and
approaches
to
assignments.
Hopefully
this
new
habit
will
make
it
a
lot
easier
on
me
this
semester
when
I
have
to
read
long
books
in
short
periods
of
time
in
some
of
my
writing-based
classes.
So
after
a
year
of
being
a
WA
I
have
suddenly
become
a
student
who
would
rather
write
numerous
papers
than
have
to
take
a
test.
To
reiterate
earlier
points,
events
in
my
own
academic
and
personal
writing
life
have
also
played
a
large
part
in
my
interest
in
writing,
and
these
experiences
will
undoubtedly
also
assist
me
in
my
future
as
a
writing
associate.
My
experiences
as
a
WA
will
most
certainly
help
me
in
the
future
as
a
writer
and
I
can
share
the
knowledge
I
have
acquired
with
new
WAs
this
semester.
I
will
admit
that
I
am
nervous
to
receive
my
assignment
for
the
upcoming
fall
semester
because
I
know
that
some
professors
at
Lafayette
who
are
much
easier
to
work
with
than
others.
I
have
also
discovered
that
being
able
to
fit
four
rounds
of
conferences
into
my
schedule
is
a
fairly
large
challenge
so
I
am
looking
forward
to
sitting
down
with
my
partner
professor
to
optimally
agree
on
some
dates
which
will
make
both
of
our
jobs
significantly
easier.
Working
as
a
WA
is
an
experience
I
would
also
recommend
for
those
Lafayette
students
interested
in
the
position.
The
rewards
of
helping
others
and
increasing
my
own
writing
and
time
management
skills
have
been
an
excellent
experience
and
I
look
forward
to
my
future
tasks
with
the
college
writing
program.
