Project
for
WA
Workshop:
Literary
Narrative
Fall
2002
From
the
moment
I
was
thrust
into
my
formal
education,
I
was
immediately
introduced
to
the
act
of
writing.
I
can
remember
coming
home
from
nursery
school
as
a
mere
four
year
old
and
showing
my
parents
popsicle
stick
figures
that
demonstrated
the
letters
of
the
alphabet.
And,
I
can
remember
getting
so
excited
when
my
parents
and
I
would
sit
down
at
night
and
try
to
form
words
out
of
these
figures,
while
also
naming
every
word
I
associated
with
the
letter
each
figure
represented.
Although
these
earliest
acts
may
not
constitute
writing
,
they
were
the
basis
for
the
writing
I
was
to
perform
in
the
future,
as
word
association
and
overall
knowledge
of
the
alphabet
are
the
keys
to
any
beginner
level
writer.
I
can
clearly
remember
my
very
first
writing
act.
In
Mrs.
Ziegler's
first
grade
classroom,
I
was
instructed
to
read
a
copy
of
I
Skate,
We
Skate,
a
book
designed
to
instruct
students
to
form
simple,
although
original
sentences.
I
think
the
first
few
sentences
I
constructed
were
along
the
lines
of
I
swim.
We
swim.
For
the
remainder
of
first
grade,
the
goal
was
for
students
to
achieve
basic
reading
and
writing
levels.
Hence,
I
think
a
good
majority
of
my
writing
was
based
on
such
reading
as
the
aforementioned
example.
By
the
time
I
was
a
second-grader,
however,
the
focus
of
writing
became
more
individual.
I
was
instructed
to
view
myself
as
an
outsider
to
the
books
and
short
stories
that
I
read
in
class
and
react
to
them
in
such
a
manner,
creating
myself
as
either
a
figure
within
the
framework
of
the
story,
or
simply
describing
how
I
would
respond
in
a
similar
situation
as
those
characters
in
the
stories
I
had
just
read.
While
in
second
grade,
I
remember
my
teacher
trying
to
instill
a
sense
of
excitement
when
it
came
to
writing.
Everything
from
writing
holiday
cards,
list
wishes
to
Santa,
or
Valentine's
Day
cards
to
that
special
crush
was
thrilling
because
it
was
new
and
because
I
was
the
one
doing
the
writing.
By
the
end
of
second
grade,
I
know
I
had
reached
a
level
in
my
writing
that
had
surpassed
some
of
my
peers.
I
was
so
avid
a
reader
of
Nancy
Drew
detective
stories
that
I
would
set
out
to
write
similar
stories
of
my
own,
even
when
they
were
not
assigned
to
me.
And,
as
I
was
introduced
to
the
most
basic
forms
of
poetry,
such
as
Haiku
and
Limericks
while
in
second
grade,
my
interests
started
to
shift
in
the
direction
of
poetry.
I
kept
a
journal
of
lines
for
the
poems
I
would
write
because
I
had
trouble
focusing
on
a
particular
theme
for
any
of
my
poetry.
I
can
remember
at
least
five
different
versions
of
a
poem
I
had
written
called
My
Special
Place
,
as
I
could
not
get
the
second
stanza
to
follow
along
with
what
I
had
written
in
the
first
stanza.
At
that
time
in
the
summer
between
second
and
third
grades
when
my
third
grade
teacher
assignment
became
available,
my
mother
became
oveijoyed
when
she
learned
I
was
to
have
Ms.
Dorfman
as
my
teacher.
Ms.
Dorfman
was,
after
all,
the
teacher
within
my
school
district
that
was
most
obsessed
with
writing.
My
mother
had
heard
rumors
that
students
of
Ms.
Dorfman's
were
writing
two,
sometimes
three
hours
out
of
the
school
day.
For
someone
that
was
that
attuned
to
the
act
of
writing,
Ms.
Dorfman
and
I
were
to
be
a
perfect
match.
As
a
third
grader
in
Ms.
Dorfman's
class,
I
learned
more
about
the
act
of
writing
than
in
any
other
class
from
elementary
school
to
high
school.
Because
the
rumors
that
my
mother
had
heard
were
true,
I
was
taught
that
in
order
to
be
a
good
writer,
you
simply
had
to
write.
Within
each
school
day
we
would
focus
primarily
on
creative
writing,
albeit
different
forms
of
creative
writing.
I
kept
a
daily
journal
of
my
day
at
school,
with
an
entry
in
the
morning
and
an
entry
just
before
the
school
day
had
ended.
And,
throughout
the
course
of
the
day,
creative
writing
workshops
were
conducted
that
promoted
one-on-one
interaction
between
students
and
Ms.
Dorfman.
Overall,
if
one
aspect
of
Ms.
Dorfman's
teaching
has
impacted
my
writing
style
over
the
years,
it
has
been
the
support
she
garnered
from
parents
of
those
students
she
taught.
Sponsoring
a
young
authors'
day
where
parents
could
come
and
listen
to
the
writing
their
children
had
done,
for
example,
Ms.
Dorfman
successfully
promoted
a
parent-student
writing
relationship
that
has
carried
over
even
into
my
college
years.
Although
I
favor
one
parent
over
the
other
in
terms
of
reading
my
writing,
I
have
never
been
afraid
to
ask
for
help
or
encouragement
from
either
of
my
parents
because
I
have
always
felt
I
had
an
active
support
system
in
place
whenever
I
needed
assistance
with
my
writing.
And,
although
I
am
not
the
best
at
taking
criticism
from
readers
of
my
work
because
I
sometimes
take
comments
too
directly,
I
have
always
appreciated
a
second
set
of
eyes
and
ears.
For
the
remainder
of
my
elementary
school
years,
I
built
a
solid
foundation
of
writing
from
which
to
work
in
the
next
level
of
my
education.
I
was
introduced
to
the
ever
popular
genre
of
the
research
paper
in
fifth
grade,
as
I
had
to
research
two
states
within
the
United
States
and
write
papers
on
my
findings.
It
is
from
this
marked
genre
that
I
could
springboard
to
the
next
level
because
I
was
found
sufficient
enough
to
not
only
perform
research,
but
to
also
present
that
research
in
a
certain,
specialized
format,
a
task
that
was
used
continuously
throughout
my
middle-school
days.
When
I
reached
middle-school,
I
found
that
a
whole
area
of
writing
that
had
formerly
been
suppressed
had
now
been
brought
to
the
surface.
Whereas
writing
in
elementary
school
was,
for
the
most
part,
done
on
topics
such
as
history
and
literature,
writing
in
middle-school
was
also
expected
in
the
areas
of
mathematics
and
science.
I
remember
writing
on
topics
such
as
pollution
and
ozone
depletion,
while
also
writing
for
the
first
time
laboratory
reports
in
my
science
classes.
I
was
introduced
to
the
scientific
method
and
was
expected
to
remember
all
the
steps
that
came
along
with
this
processed
style
of
thinking
and
writing.
Along
with
the
introduction
to
these
other
areas
of
writing,
I
was
also
expected
to
become
more
creative
in
my
literature
classes.
I
remember,
for
instance,
a
story
I
had
written
in
seventh
grade
where
I
wrote
from
the
perspective
of
a
worker
in
a
florist
shop
that
specialized
in
selling
poinsettias.
Because
the
story
had
been
written
during
the
Christmas
season,
my
teacher
was
impressed
with
my
unique,
chosen
point-of-view.
My
teacher
commented,
Kim,
I
loved
the
line
about
the
Christmas
tree
protecting
the
city.
Where
did
you
come
up
with
the
idea
for
this
piece?
Looking
back
on
those
comments
almost
eight
years
removed,
I
still
feel
a
sense
of
pride
in
my
writing.
Perhaps
this
sense
of
pride
is
what
distinguishes
me
from
other
writers.
When
I
am
finished
writing
a
piece,
although
I
know
good
writing
is
never
finished,
I
feel
as
if
I
have
accomplished
what
it
is
I
set
out
to
accomplish
when
writing
that
particular
work.
As
I
moved
along
in
middle-school,
I
found
that
I
grew
apart
from
my
writing.
The
learning
approaches
that
were
used
in
my
literature
courses,
combined
with
my
new
affinity
for
the
sciences,
had,
for
the
first
time
in
my
life,
guided
me
along
a
different
pathway
in
my
writing.
I
even
stopped
composing
the
poetry
that
I
had
written
for
years
because
it
all
just
seemed
so
drab
and
lifeless.
I
must
say
that
I
was
not
altogether
unhappy
with
my
writing
at
this
stage;
I
just
felt
as
if
there
were
other,
more
interesting
routes
to
follow
in
my
education.
However,
when
it
became
time
to
start
my
high
school
courses,
I
think
I
was
eagerly
awaiting
an
English
teacher
that
would
renew
my
interest
in
writing.
Thankfully,
my
ninth
grade
English
teacher
lived
up
to
and
moved
beyond
my
expectations
of
high-
school
level
writing.
At
this
particular
point
in
my
history
as
a
writer,
I
was,
for
the
first
time,
challenged
when
it
came
to
writing.
Not
since
my
experiences
with
my
third
grade
teacher
had
a
teacher
ever
stimulated
me
so
much
when
it
came
to
writing.
Introducing
me
to
the
art
of
analyzation
of
literature,
my
ninth
grade
teacher
had,
in
a
sense,
introduced
me
to
a
new
style
of
writing.
Similar
to
the
processed
science
writing
I
had
done
in
middle
school
and
similar
to
the
creative
writing
I
had
done
all
my
life,
analyzation
writing
,
if
I
can
so
properly
label
it
so,
became,
for
me,
the
ideal
genre
in
which
to
write.
