Junior
year
as
a
student
proved
incredibly
constructive
and
challenging
for
me.
As
one
should
expect,
such
growth
isnOt
initiated
by
a
simple
semester
at
Lafayette,
that
is,
by
taking
easy
courses
or
only
putting
forth
enough
effort
to
pass.
I
believe
that
confronting
a
challengeNleaving
oneOs
comfort
zoneNis
the
best
catalyst
for
positive
change.
The
field
of
writing
is
no
exception
to
this
rule.
Two
experiences
that
promoted
my
growth
as
a
writer
include
employment
as
a
writing
associate
and
attendance
at
KingOs
College
in
London
last
semester.
First
thing
first:
meeting
with
the
CWP
staff
before
classes
start.
Beginning
fall
semester
with
a
brief
indoctrination
into
the
WA
program,
WAOs
are
given
considerable
freedom
to
conduct
meetings
with
student
writers
as
we
see
fit.
While
the
openness
of
the
process
is
crucial
to
the
meaningful
development
of
both
parties
involved,
I
found
the
task
difficult.
Though
I
consider
myself
a
NgoodO
writer
(whatever
that
means),
knowing
how
to
convey
oneOs
self
well
is
not
the
same
as
sharing
knowledge
for
othersO
benefit.
I
really
didnOt
know
what
to
expect.
How
would
students
receive
my
advice?
What
were
their
backgrounds
in
English?
What
would
the
professor
expect
from
students
on
their
first
assignments?
I
remember
my
first
appointments
as
lackluster
but
sufficient:
some
positive
feedback
and
some
disappointments
can
be
noted.
LetOs
start
with
the
good
news.
To
my
surprise,
most
freshmen
students
in
my
assigned
class
accepted
advice
happily,
often
offering
insights
and
critiques
of
their
own
when
prodded
a
bit.
Students
seemedNor
at
least
pretended
to
beNenthusiastic
about
the
nature
of
the
assignment
and
the
year
ahead.
Most
students
agreed
that
the
personal,
open
quality
of
the
short
essay
was
dissimilar
from
what
they
had
experienced
in
high
school,
and
contended
that
the
format
was
conducive
to
genuinely
deeper
thinking
and
writing.
We
began
to
build
rapports,
sharing
ideas
and
questions
interchangeably.
I
shared
some
issues
I
face
when
writing
in
an
attempt
to
show
students
that
I
am
not
necessarily
an
authority
in
writing,
but
instead
a
peer
writer
facing
many
of
the
same
struggles.
Since
I
had
taken
two
classes
with
my
host
professor,
I
understood
some
of
the
peculiarities
of
her
style
and
expectations,
and
shared
these
clues
with
students.
Professor
Fabian
gave
some
specific
advice
willingly,
and
encouraged
me
to
let
students
know
Nhow
things
workedO
in
her
class.
Fortunately,
she
was
very
open
and
communicated
well
with
me.
Now
for
the
not-so-good
aspects
of
the
experience.
First
of
all,
the
majority
of
the
papers
I
received
were
virtually
unreadable.
The
writing
was
so
poor
that
I
sometimes
could
not
even
understand
what
students
were
trying
to
say.
While
this
problem
remained
prominent
throughout
the
semester,
even
to
the
third
major
writing
assignment,
the
intention
of
the
first
assignment
proved
incomprehensible
for
many
students,
and
the
quality
of
the
essays
demonstrated
this
point.
The
writing
was
sub-par,
the
intended
theme
of
the
papers
untouched,
and
grammar
usage
disturbingly
inadequate.
While
WAOs
are
instructed
to
focus
chiefly
on
higher
level
concerns,
such
as
the
paperOs
theme
and
thesis,
I
found
myself
unable
to
even
comprehend
these
aspects.
Poor
writing
often
clouds
primary
concerns.
When
conferences
began,
I
remained
positive.
I
avoided
overbearing
tones.
But
on
the
inside
I
wanted
to
pick
up
studentsO
pens
and
rewrite
their
papers.
Actually,
I
provided
so
much
NcommentaryO
that
one
could
barely
read
around
my
pencil
marks
to
see
the
original
text.
I
over-critiqued
for
sure,
and
some
students
were
taken
aback
by
the
breadth
of
the
criticisms.
While
this
response
is
expected,
I
realize
after
a
semester
of
working
as
a
writing
associate
that
I
conducted
the
first
conferences
incorrectly.
I
took
control
of
the
meetings
and
criticizedNhowever
politely
is
irrelevantNaspects
of
studentsO
work
that
I
found
particularly
egregious.
While
my
goal
was
and
remains
to
help
students
convey
themselves
in
the
best
way
possible,
I
began
to
realize
more
effective
means
of
achieving
this
end
as
the
year
progressed.
Through
the
course
of
the
semester,
we
learned
how
to
foster
an
environment
conducive
to
student-run
conferences
rather
than
those
in
which
the
tone
of
discussion
is
set
solely
by
the
writing
associate.
If
the
WA
eases
up
on
his
critiques
and
criticisms,
the
conference
becomes
very
quiet.
When
students
seem
unwilling
to
provide
any
discussion
on
their
own,
the
situation
becomes
awkward.
In
a
way,
the
silence
gives
the
WA
a
chance
to
open
discussion
on
the
studentOs
terms.
In
most
cases,
students
will
come
up
with
some
aspects
of
the
assignment
to
discuss
themselves,
in
order
to
avoid
staring
at
their
paper
in
uneasy
silence.
In
other
cases,
the
WA
may
be
forced
to
begin
discussion
by
asking
questions
about
certain
passages
or
highlighting
possible
issues
in
the
paper.
Nonetheless,
the
experience
enlightens
both
WA
and
student
writer,
since
one
writer
is
expected
to
explain
his
or
her
own
work
to
another
writer.
Through
the
ensuing
discourse,
both
of
us
can
catch
a
glimpse
into
the
processes
that
comprise
another
personOs
writing,
and
the
writer
can
hear
a
spectatorOs
opinion
of
his
or
her
piece.
Students
rediscover
their
own
writing
when
they
look
deeper
into
weak
points.
It
is
most
constructive
when
they
recognize
areas
in
need
of
improvement
themselves.
When
this
self-investigation
takes
place
during
conferences,
student
writers
become
the
chief
authority
of
their
own
papers,
and
the
WAOs
contribution
becomes
secondary.
Though
in
my
case
I
served
as
a
mentor
or
resource
for
freshmen
students
with
little
or
no
knowledge
of
college
writing,
taking
part
in
this
process
helps
show
both
parties
involved
how
to
work
through
rough
spots
in
papers
or
assignments.
In
other
words,
as
I
better
understand
my
purpose
as
a
mentor,
I
become
increasingly
cognizant
of
my
own
advice
as
a
WA
and
instruction
by
CWP
staff.
I
am
not
self-aggrandizing;
what
I
mean
to
say
is
that
I
use
the
skills
gained
as
a
writing
associate
in
my
own
writing
to
confront
the
challenges
faced
in
academia.
When
writing
papers
or
conveying
ideas,
I
second-guess
my
instincts
and
notice
flaws
more
often.
I
realize
when
I
fall
into
the
bad
habits
of
fellow
students
whose
writing
I
criticized.
Just
as
importantly,
I
am
more
open
to
the
peculiarities
and
styles
of
othersO
writing.
At
the
beginning
of
first
semester,
as
previously
stated,
I
could
barely
understand
what
the
class
of
freshmen
was
attempting
to
convey.
But
learning
to
look
past
the
grammatical
and
organizational
concerns
to
see
the
broader
concepts
and
ideas
hidden
beneath
the
surface
has
improved
my
reading
comprehension
and
interaction
with
fellow
students.
My
work
as
a
WA
has
helped
me
help
others
for
sure,
but
has
also
helped
me
help
myself.
It
is
fortunate
that
I
grew
as
a
student
and
writer
first
semester
of
junior
year.
Every
skill
and
bit
of
ingenuity
I
could
muster
proved
crucial
to
the
semester
I
spent
at
one
of
the
most
respected,
challenging
universities
in
Great
Britain.
The
differences
between
the
American
and
British
education
systems
are
immense,
not
to
mention
the
divergence
between
a
large,
international
university
and
a
small
liberal
arts
college
like
Lafayette.
One
of
the
most
shocking
realizations
about
KingOs
College
is
formality
of
the
teacher-student
relationship
and
the
strictness
of
the
curriculum.
While
studentsO
instruction
is
the
primary
concern
of
all
educators,
there
is
little
room
for
questions
about
the
material,
no
impromptu
discussions
with
professors,
little
feedback
regarding
academic
progress,
and
barely
any
discourse
between
the
administration
and
student
body.
Students
read
from
the
assigned
reading
list
(if
the
books
are
available
in
the
library)
and
attend
class
once
or
twice
a
week
for
broad
lectures
and
short
discussions,
neither
of
which
are
particularly
or
necessarily
pertinent
to
the
grading
process.
These
differences
caught
me
by
surprise.
Studying
subjects
in
both
the
Department
of
Social
Science
(War
Studies)
and
Department
of
Humanities
(History)
further
complicated
the
transition
to
KingOs,
because
each
department
has
its
own
set
of
expectations,
rules,
and
practices.
In
the
War
Studies
Department,
students
are
expected
to
attend
classes
for
only
eight
weeks:
a
one
to
two-hour
lecture
session
and
a
one
hour
discussion
session
take
place
each
week.
During
class
time,
students
are
reminded
that
only
vigilant
ingestion
of
dozens
of
books
and
articles
warrants
passage
of
the
one
and
only
examination,
given
over
a
month
after
the
last
class
session.
Class
time
essentially
serves
as
an
arena
to
discuss
topics
with
which
students
are
supposedly
already
acclimated.
In
England,
studentsO
course
of
study
includes
only
classes
designed
specifically
for
one
major,
which
means
that
my
British
counterparts
had
been
studying
topics
relevant
to
War
Studies
for
two
years,
while
I
had
barely
studied
anything
specifically
useful.
Someone
without
a
strong
background
in
the
subject
canOt
help
but
be
intimidated.
More
disturbing,
the
American
grading
system
seems
grossly
inflated
compared
to
the
British
system,
in
which
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
receive
an
NA.O
How
did
I
prepare
for
classes
or
the
examination?
I
wrote.
I
remembered
the
struggles
of
my
students
in
the
Writing
Room,
and
I
recalled
the
weekly
CWP
meetings
when
we
discussed
ways
to
jump
the
hurdles
of
academic
writing.
Every
week
a
question
on
the
syllabus
served
as
the
focus
of
the
lecture,
and
I
searched
through
available
sources
to
address
each
question.
Writing
isnOt
synonymous
with
transcription;
it
is
a
way
to
study,
a
way
to
learn,
and
a
way
to
train
the
mind.
Nowhere
else
is
that
idea
stressed
more
than
in
the
Watt
Writing
Room.
When
the
time
came
to
write
the
3,000-word
unassessed
paper,
I
was
ready.
As
for
the
most
important
task
of
the
War
Studies
semester,
the
final
examinations,
I
had
fortunately
created
a
series
of
papers
that
doubled
as
exam
review
sheets.
My
performance
on
the
exams
was
satisfactory.
For
my
European
history
course,
spring-semester
students
are
to
write
six
2,500-word
papers
in
the
span
of
eight
weeks.
After
students
write
the
papers,
then
their
commentary
is
discussed
in
a
small
group
for
one
hour
each
week.
Allow
me
to
clarify:
we
essentially
wrote
research
papers
every
week
on
topics
that
we
had
never
spoken
about
in
the
classroom,
and
only
after
finishing
the
assignment
was
it
discussed.
Students
are
not
granted
a
second
chance
to
edit
or
revise.
Never
before
had
I
experienced
anything
so
seemingly
preposterous
in
all
my
years
of
schooling.
Though
I
donOt
think
that
any
undergraduate
course
should
be
conducted
in
this
manner,
I
still
needed
to
learn
how
to
write
these
papers,
and
adequately.
Aside
from
searching
through
books
every
week
and
taking
copious
notes,
I
was
forced
to
change
the
way
I
conducted
my
research
and
wrote
my
papers.
To
be
perfectly
honest,
I
never
fully
understood
the
topics
being
discussed.
A
week
is
hardly
enough
time
to
gain
an
understanding
of
topics
as
tremendous
as
the
revolutions
of
1848
or
the
intricacies
of
the
NFinal
Solution.O
Without
a
professorOs
insight,
personal
discretion
in
tackling
these
topics
becomes
the
most
important
and
sometimes
the
only
way
to
explore
otherwise
unknown
topics.
I
noted
a
link
between
the
processes
of
writing
as
discussed
during
staff
meetings
and
this
new
way
of
teaching
myself
material.
I
was
forced
to
reevaluate
my
own
writing
and
thinking.
The
professors
at
KingOs
never
told
us
how
to
fix
errors.
Metaphorically
speaking,
they
served
as
learning
associates,
prompting
students
to
discover
and
improve
the
ways
in
which
they
learn,
record
information,
and
write.
Learning
how
to
operate
in
a
foreign
system
and
working
to
acclimate
myself
to
new
expectations
put
all
my
years
of
education
to
the
test.
More
than
ever,
I
realized
that
how
generally
useful
writing
is
in
the
academic
world.
I
wrote
in
my
last
literacy
narrative
that
at
its
best,
writing
is
a
mode
of
expression
and
exploration:
a
way
to
delve
into
the
self,
ponder
the
past,
and
comprehend
lifeOs
most
daunting
questions.
I
don't
mean
to
imply
that
writing
is
required
for
introspection;
instead
it
is
a
means
of
investigating
the
world.
The
past
year
has
only
strengthened
that
conviction,
and
I
am
sure
that
senior
year
will
do
the
same.
