When
a
professional
artist
becomes
well-known,
he
usually
has
a
unique
style.
He
practices
the
style
over
and
over
until
he
masters
it,
and
then
one
day
some
patron
recognizes
it
as
true
art.
He
then
can
branch
out
from
that
style,
trying
what
makes
him
truly
happy
after
already
finding
his
link
to
success.
Over
the
course
of
my
lifetime,
I
likewise
established
my
NstyleO
as
a
writer.
I
use
a
journalistic
and
often
witty
style
for
newspaper
articles,
and
a
formal
and
NacademicO
style
for
papers
and
essays.
Yet
during
the
past
year,
I
came
to
the
realization
that
there
were
not
many
times
in
my
writing
history
where
I
really
Nbranched
outO,
or
wrote
in
new
ways
that
felt
extremely
challenging
or
different.
Of
course
I
had
tried
new
types
of
writing,
but
each
type
that
I
completed
consistently
began
to
have
same
feel.
I
therefore
sought
to
expand
my
writing
palette
during
the
past
two
semesters
and
this
summer.
In
regard
to
academic
writing,
the
majority
of
my
freshman
and
sophomore
English
classes
were
literature
and
literary
history
courses
that
required
response
papers,
literary
criticisms,
and
poetry
analysis
essays.
While
I
was
able
to
improve
my
writing
in
each
of
these
classes,
I
felt
I
was
still
only
utilizing
the
same
NformalO
writing
style
in
each
class.
For
this
reason,
I
wanted
to
take
English
courses
that
seemed
interesting
and
different
to
meNones
that
would
allow
me
to
expand
my
writing
repertoire
and
look
at
the
writing
of
others
in
a
whole
new
light.
With
The
Lafayette
newspaper,
I
also
began
to
attempt
techniques
that
I
knew
would
set
my
recent
articles
apart
from
my
old
ones.
And
with
a
summer
internship
that
offered
the
potential
to
finally
combine
my
interests
in
finance
and
writing,
I
embarked
on
a
journey
that
would
ultimately
help
me
identify
my
future
career.
Through
all
of
these
experiences,
I
was
able
to
grow
as
both
a
writer
and
a
WA
and
help
my
students
improve
their
writing
just
as
I
felt
I
had
improved
mine.
I
began
my
academic
writing
last
fall
in
a
class
entitled
NThe
English
Language.O
Completely
different
from
any
English
course
I
had
taken
at
Lafayette,
this
was
my
first
true
language
class
since
NLanguage
ArtsO
in
seventh
grade.
Not
only
did
we
learn
the
basics
of
grammar,
syntax,
and
word
formations,
but
we
also
studied
dialects,
pronunciation,
discourse,
and
conversation
frameworks.
I
learned
how
to
analyze
both
spoken
and
written
conversations,
looking
at
pauses,
interruptions,
tone,
underlying
meaning,
word
choice,
and
sentence
length.
Not
only
did
this
course
give
me
a
greater
appreciation
for
the
English
language,
but
it
also
allowed
me
to
think
more
carefully
about
my
own
writing.
Analyzing
othersO
speech
and
writing
enabled
me
to
see
varying
techniques
of
conveying
a
thought,
argument,
or
emotion
that
might
not
have
been
in
my
usual
writing
style.
And
by
learning
these
techniques,
I
also
feel
I
was
able
to
be
a
better
WA.
By
looking
carefully
at
studentsO
word
choices,
syntax,
verb
usage,
tone,
and
stylistic
techniques
(like
back
channeling),
I
could
more
easily
identify
their
writing
methods
and
the
way
in
which
they
were
trying
to
convey
their
ideas.
I
feel
that
a
course
like
this
is
one
that
all
WAOs
should
take,
as
it
gave
me
a
firmer
grasp
on
the
English
language
and
allowed
me
to
think
about
my
writing
and
speech
in
ways
I
had
not
previously
done.
In
the
spring,
I
took
another
class
that
helped
me
explore
new
styles
and
methods
of
writingNWriting
About
Food.
This
class
was
particularly
interesting
not
only
in
its
subject
matter,
but
also
the
types
of
media
we
used
to
learn.
Besides
completing
movie
reviews,
article
summaries,
and
reading
responses
to
memoirs
and
novels,
we
were
able
to
develop
creative
blog
entries,
restaurant
reviews,
recipe
presentations,
and
a
food
and
living
magazine.
I
learned
how
to
alter
my
usually
formal
tone
in
my
online
blog
entries
and
food
magazine,
taking
on
a
more
NcasualO
style
full
of
descriptive
adjectives,
shorter
sentences,
and
humor.
While
this
was
a
challenge
at
first,
I
felt
I
truly
grew
as
a
writer
by
completing
these
non-typical
assignments;
they
forced
me
to
put
forth
greater
effort
and
try
types
of
writing
that
I
was
not
accustomed
to
doing
in
an
academic
setting.
Working
on
the
food
magazine
also
made
me
reminiscent
of
the
writing
I
did
as
Yearbook
Editor
in
high
school,
as
it
forced
me
to
keep
my
audience
in
mind
throughout
the
entire
writing
process.
Thinking
about
the
audience
of
a
piece
also
helped
my
work
as
WA,
as
I
found
myself
asking
students
about
the
intent
of
their
writing
and
the
audience
for
whom
they
had
written
it.
By
considering
their
audience,
students
began
to
define
more
technical
terms,
alter
their
tone,
or
explain
examples
in
a
way
that
made
their
papers
more
reader-friendly
and
clear.
In
addition
to
taking
English
courses,
I
also
continued
to
write
for
The
Lafayette
throughout
the
fall
and
spring
semesters.
While
I
felt
that
I
wrote
many
good
feature
articles
and
reviews
over
the
course
of
the
year,
I
also
began
to
feel
that
some
of
my
articles
were
rather
Nsafe.O
While
of
course
I
had
included
quotes,
humor,
and
student
opinions
in
each
piece,
I
began
to
see
that
I
often
molded
my
thoughts
and
opinions
into
ones
that
did
not
fully
portray
my
take
on
an
event.
I
have
always
tried
to
please
others
with
my
writing,
and
for
fear
of
offending
anyone
had
never
written
a
truly
negative
review
or
controversial
article.
Yet
after
having
a
terrible
experience
at
the
opening
of
LafayetteOs
new
nightclub,
I
decided
to
divulge
the
angry
opinions
of
myself
and
many
other
students
despite
the
sincere
efforts
to
make
the
event
an
enjoyable
one.
While
I
know
that
those
who
were
involved
with
the
event
may
have
been
upset
by
my
article,
I
felt
that
it
was
my
duty
as
a
journalist
to
expose
the
miscommunication,
misinformation,
and
complications
surrounding
event.
By
writing
this
article,
I
became
less
afraid
to
express
my
true
opinions
in
spite
of
not
being
able
to
please
all
of
my
readers.
This
again
helped
me
to
be
a
better
WA,
allowing
me
to
identify
NsafeO
or
vague
writing
in
student
papers
and
asking
them
to
expand
their
examples
and
opinions
into
ones
that
truly
expressed
their
beliefs.
My
last
and
most
recent
experience
with
writing
was
during
my
summer
internship
at
Merrill
Lynch.
Within
the
Investment
Strategies
Group,
I
worked
with
a
manager
who
writes
thematic
investing
pieces
to
inform
clients
of
long-term
themes
or
ideas.
I
spent
my
ten
weeks
helping
to
write
several
research
reports,
sometimes
doing
research
and
making
outlines
for
my
manager
and
sometimes
doing
the
writing
myself.
For
example,
I
helped
to
write
a
piece
on
the
growing
trend
of
obesity
in
America,
and
the
companies
one
can
invest
in
related
to
this
theme.
(Such
companies
included
plus-size
apparel
stores,
pharmaceutical
companies
making
anti-obesity
drugs,
and
gaming
companies
such
as
Nintendo
who
have
created
exercise
games
like
the
Wii
Fit).
This
exposed
me
to
a
new
type
of
writing,
as
the
reports
at
Merrill
Lynch
typically
highlighted
the
main
ideas
or
conclusions
on
the
front
page
and
then
outlined
the
points
in
more
explanation
and
detail
throughout
the
report.
I
learned
how
to
present
my
writing
in
a
clear
and
explanatory
manner
for
clients,
since
not
all
of
those
reading
the
report
have
the
same
levels
of
knowledge
about
each
topic
or
strategy.
When
two
of
these
reports
were
published
and
received
praise
from
others
within
the
firm,
I
truly
felt
like
an
accomplished
writer.
One
of
the
reports
was
even
featured
on
CNBC,
for
which
my
manager
had
a
live
interview
on
a
finance
show.
When
my
manager
himself
told
me
how
impressed
he
was
with
the
work
I
had
done,
I
realized
how
glad
I
was
that
I
had
chosen
to
pursue
writing
in
addition
to
my
finance
major.
Learning
to
write
well
is
a
skill
that
is
necessary
in
almost
any
career
path,
and
is
what
ultimately
helped
me
to
receive
a
full-time
job
offer
for
next
year
from
Merrill
Lynch.
One
of
the
best
pieces
of
advice
I
was
given
throughout
the
summer
was
to
consider
what
the
client
would
really
want
to
know
about
the
topic,
and
if
that
was
not
always
clear,
to
ask
him
directly.
This
was
another
parallel
to
my
work
as
a
WA,
and
the
importance
of
considering
oneOs
audience
in
order
to
express
ideas
clearly
and
informatively.
By
stepping
outside
the
report
(or
WA
paper),
we
can
ask
ourselves
what
WE
would
want
to
know
about
the
topic.
When
transitioning
from
writer
to
reader,
we
can
better
judge
if
the
paper
is
organized,
detailed
enough,
and
free
of
errors.
The
WA
staff
meeting
where
we
discussed
reader-based
prose
has
therefore
been
most
applicable
to
my
experiences,
as
writing
for
the
reader
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
important
lessons
a
writer
can
learn
and
a
WA
can
share.
All
of
my
academic,
extracurricular,
and
work
experiences
involving
writing
helped
to
both
prepare
me
and
improve
my
abilities
as
a
WA
throughout
the
fall
and
spring
semesters
of
this
year.
I
began
my
year
as
the
WA
for
an
upper-level
economics
class
of
juniors
and
seniors
entitled
Women
and
the
Economy.
The
studentsO
primary
project
over
the
course
of
the
semester
was
to
complete
an
econometric
analysis
paper
on
a
topic
of
their
choice,
provided
that
it
related
to
a
social
or
economic
issue
discussed
in
class.
I
was
happy
to
draw
from
my
economics
background
in
order
to
help
the
students,
and
initially
assumed
that
juniors
and
seniors
would
be
much
more
advanced
in
their
writing
abilities.
I
soon
came
to
find,
however,
that
many
of
these
students
struggled
more
with
their
writing
than
the
freshmen
or
sophomore
writers
I
had
encountered
in
drop-in
hours.
This
became
both
a
challenging
and
rewarding
experience,
as
these
older
students
were
extremely
appreciative
of
my
help
and
desired
to
know
all
of
my
suggestions
and
advice.
One
student
even
asked
to
schedule
an
additional
conference
on
a
draft,
as
she
was
concerned
about
her
writing
and
wanted
additional
feedback
from
her
WA.
I
became
a
friend
to
all
of
my
student
writers,
and
learned
that
working
as
a
team
(as
opposed
to
NstudentO
and
Nwriting
authorityO)
creates
a
successful
environment
for
discussing
and
bettering
student
papers.
During
the
spring,
I
was
paired
with
a
VaST
class
on
mental
illnesses
and
psychological
disorders.
While
this
seemed
like
an
interesting
topic
on
which
to
read
papers,
it
also
proved
to
be
both
draining
and
challenging.
The
students
struggled
with
putting
their
personal
thoughts
and
opinions
into
the
writing,
as
well
as
learning
to
harness
their
emotions
and
experiences
to
make
the
papers
more
detailed.
I
also
oftentimes
found
it
difficult
to
read
through
twenty
papers
on
memoirs
of
depression
or
other
saddening
disorders.
I
also
learned
how
what
may
be
just
a
writing
assignment
to
one
person
can
be
extremely
meaningful
to
someone
else;
I
had
to
prevent
myself
from
crying
during
a
conference
when
discussing
a
studentOs
paper
about
the
Virginia
Tech
tragedy
after
having
experienced
it
firsthand
with
the
death
of
a
Lafayette
student
whom
I
had
known.
The
experience
with
the
class
also
proved
particularly
challenging
in
that
the
professor
had
not
set
clear
due
dates
or
maintained
an
organized
method
for
sign-ups.
This
caused
many
of
the
students
to
turn
in
drafts
just
hours
before
a
conference,
or
sometimes
not
at
all.
As
I
struggled
to
maintain
organization
between
the
professor,
the
students,
and
myself,
I
also
learned
that
some
of
the
best
conferences
are
those
to
which
the
students
do
not
come
completely
prepared.
One
night
one
of
the
more
conscientious
students
came
ten
minutes
late
to
the
conference,
crying
because
she
had
nothing
done
and
no
time
to
write
a
paper.
After
talking
for
a
few
minutes
and
helping
her
to
calm
down,
we
discussed
some
of
her
thoughts
and
ideas
and
eventually
drafted
a
thorough
outline
of
what
she
could
write
about.
The
student
was
extremely
appreciative
and
felt
much
better
afterwards,
causing
me
to
realize
that
it
is
not
how
students
come
into
a
conference
that
is
important,
but
rather
how
they
come
out
of
it.
Perhaps
the
most
memorable
and
significant
experiences
for
me
as
a
WA,
however,
occurred
during
drop-in
hours.
These
several
hours
over
the
course
of
two
semesters
led
me
to
experience
scenarios
I
had
not
anticipated,
conferences
I
had
not
thought
of
as
typical
NWA
conferences.O
Once
such
experience
occurred
with
a
foreign
student
from
an
FYS
class
whose
second
language
was
English.
This
student
needed
help
with
some
of
the
most
basic
writing
concepts,
such
as
structuring
sentences
correctly,
organizing
her
thoughts
clearly
into
a
paper,
and
learning
how
to
use
quotations
without
plagiarizing.
The
student
had
copied
and
pasted
an
entire
page
from
a
source
as
an
explanation
for
one
of
the
questions
in
the
prompt,
and
I
became
frustrated
at
how
difficult
it
was
to
help
someone
with
concepts
I
was
not
even
sure
how
to
explain.
Yet
after
spending
an
hour
and
a
half
with
her
discussing
how
she
could
improve
the
paper,
I
felt
that
we
had
made
progress.
I
explained
grammatical
concepts
such
as
subject-verb
order,
and
other
concepts
such
as
how
to
write
an
introduction
and
how
to
prepare
a
bibliography.
Though
the
paper
still
had
a
long
way
to
go
(and
I
recommended
that
she
return
to
see
another
WA),
I
felt
accomplished
in
that
I
helped
solidify
her
knowledge
of
the
writing
process.
The
experience
taught
me
that
dealing
with
these
non-typical
students
is
something
that
all
WAOs
can
discuss
with
one
another,
and
attempt
to
prepare
for
during
training
and
staff
meetings.
A
last
experience
from
drop-in
hours
that
had
a
significant
impact
on
me
was
with
a
student
who
had
written
a
paper
for
an
FYS
dealing
with
race
issues.
This
student
had
grown
up
in
an
inner-city
school,
and
had
made
parallels
in
her
paper
to
experiences
she
had
gone
though
as
a
teenager.
She
described
the
poor
quality
of
the
books,
furniture,
and
even
the
administration
in
her
school
compared
to
the
nearby
NwhiteO
school,
telling
me
that
many
of
her
friends
ended
up
pregnant,
in
gangs,
or
dead.
I
was
so
shocked
by
her
experiences
that
I
continued
to
ask
her
questions,
brining
up
new
issues
that
she
found
she
could
include
in
the
paper.
She
realized
that
while
blacks
such
as
Martin
Luther
King
had
spent
so
many
years
fighting
for
freedom,
the
blacks
in
her
community
were
degrading
themselves
and
allowing
their
children
to
receive
poor-quality
education.
She
left
the
conference
with
many
new
personal
examples
to
add
to
her
paper,
and
I
left
the
conference
with
the
realization
that
each
student
writer
has
an
extremely
unique
background
full
of
experiences
to
draw
upon,
experiences
that
may
be
drastically
different
from
those
we
go
through
each
day
in
our
NLafayette
bubble.O
All
of
the
experiences
I
had
as
a
WA
over
the
course
of
the
year
led
me
to
appreciate
the
individuality
of
each
student
writer,
and
tailor
my
advice,
questions,
and
suggestions
in
ways
that
I
feel
could
be
most
helpful.
My
academic
experiences,
as
well
as
my
experiences
on
the
newspaper
and
at
my
internship,
also
enabled
me
to
realize
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
in
my
own
writing
and
apply
what
I
learned
to
my
WA
work.
And
so,
to
any
new
WAOs,
I
would
say
this:
get
to
know
your
student
writers.
Work
as
a
team,
and
be
a
friend
to
each
person;
he
or
she
will
respect
you
more
if
you
can
laugh
at
the
fact
that
his
or
her
roommate
inserted
a
not-so-appropriate
sentence
at
the
end
of
the
paper
than
if
you
act
condescending
or
authoritative.
Offer
suggestions,
but
truly
listen
to
what
each
student
has
to
say
as
well.
If
youOre
successful,
youOll
come
out
of
each
conference
feeling
you
learned
as
much
from
the
students
as
they
learned
from
youNand
thatOs
perhaps
the
most
rewarding
and
eye-opening
experience
of
all.
