WA
Essay
Fall
2008
Prospective
Writing
Associate
applicants
are
always
told
that
being
a
WA
will
improve
their
writing
skills.
I
have
to
admit
that
when
I
first
heard
that
claim
I
was
a
little
skeptical
about
what
affect
being
a
WA
might
actually
have
on
my
own
writing.
I
didnOt
doubt
the
claim
directly,
but
I
was
a
little
unsure
how
it
all
actually
happened.
Would
I
gain
some
kind
of
literary
insight
in
our
weekly
meetings?
Would
I
receive
some
sort
of
secret
knowledge
passed
down
through
generations
of
WAs?
It
was
all
a
little
hazy.
After
my
first
several
conferences,
however,
I
began
to
grasp
what
the
College
writing
program
actually
meant,
it
was
a
more
subtle
knowledge
that
is
accumulated
over
time,
and
a
sudden
epiphany.
I
can
generally
divide
my
lessons
from
my
work
as
a
WA
into
two
different
categories.
The
first
are
more
abstract
concepts
and
ideas
that
have
affected
my
writing
since
becoming
a
WA,
things
like
methodology
and
perspective.
The
second
category
can
be
more
loosely
defined
as
rules
and
styles
and
that
my
experience
since
becoming
a
WA
taught
me
that
I
had
not
learned
anywhere
else.
Meeting
with
students
for
the
first
time
as
a
Writing
Associate
can
be
a
stressful
experience.
During
my
first
conferences
I
concerned
about
interacting
with
the
students.
ItOs
a
struggle
to
strike
a
balance
between
being
a
peer,
and
also
critiquing
their
work.
Most
of
them
were
my
age
and
older,
and
the
topic,
ChildrenOs
Literature,
was
not
an
area
that
I
was
familiar
with.
I
followed
the
professorOs
advice
and
constructed
the
first
conference
as
a
discussion-based,
get-to-know-you
meeting.
This
format
allowed
me
to
become
familiar
and
comfortable
with
the
writers,
while
also
asking
questions
about
their
work.
I
was
surprised
at
how
productive
it
was,
and
how
easy
it
seemed
to
interact
with
them
as
peers
and
equals.
After
my
initial
conferences
meetings
with
students
became
easier,
but
not
always
easy.
ThereOs
a
real
gap
between
student
interest
levels,
and
there
are
conferences
that
have
attentive
students
who
are
looking
for
help,
and
then
there
are
conferences
every
so
often
that
really
try
oneOs
patience.
The
trick
is
to
not
get
discouraged
and
always
ask
lots
of
questions
to
keep
the
writer
thinking.
Although
it
sometimes
frustrates
students,
I
find
that
itOs
best
to
lead
them
to
answers
rather
than
just
tell
them
what
to
do.
A
Writing
Associate
must
make
students
revise
their
own
work
by
asking
the
right
questions
about
their
writing.
During
meetings
I
sometimes
struggled
with
explaining
my
suggestions
clearly.
I
knew
what
I
meant,
but
unfortunately
most
of
the
students
I
worked
with
were
unable
to
read
my
mind.
Through
trial
(and
a
lot
of
error)
I
found
that
the
easiest
way
for
me
was
to
use
concrete
examples,
either
by
rearranging
sentences
and
ideas
in
the
writerOs
own
work
or
by
giving
other
examples.
It
also
helps
me
if
I
write
the
paper
while
I
explain
concepts,
and
it
allows
me
to
organize
my
thoughts.
Also
in
the
first
category
is
one
of
my
most
valuable
lessons,
objectivity
in
my
own
writing.
One
of
the
most
valuable
skills
I
have
learned
as
a
WA
is
to
be
able
to
take
a
step
back
and
evaluate
my
own
work
as
if
I
were
a
student
I
was
WAing.
One
conference
in
particular
showed
me
the
importance
of
stepping
back
from
my
own
writing
and
seeing
the
flaws
and
mistakes
that
I
sometimes
make.
The
conference
occurred
two
years
ago,
the
last
time
I
served
as
a
WA.
The
assignment
was
a
literary
analysis
comparing
and
analyzing
two
different
examples
of
childrenOs
literature.
While
I
was
reading
one
studentOs
work
in
preparation
for
a
conference
it
suddenly
struck
me
how
familiar
the
writing
seemed.
The
essay
was
nearly
exactly
how
I
had
imagined
I
would
have
done
the
assignment.
The
organization,
the
word
choice,
the
grammar
and
construction
all
seemed
like
choices
I
would
have
mad.
It
posed
a
problem
when
I
tried
to
evaluate
his
work,
not
because
I
thought
that
I
could
produce
a
perfect
essay,
but
because
it
seemed
to
be
the
limit
of
my
ability,
the
very
best
paper
I
could
write.
If
I
couldnOt
shape
my
own
work
to
be
better
than
what
this
student
produced,
if
I
couldnOt
find
flaws
in
my
own
writing
that
I
could
see
in
his,
then
how
could
I
produce
something
better?
It
took
me
several
read-throughs
and
a
mild
headache
before
I
could
really
deconstruct
the
essay.
I
had
to
keep
reminding
myself
to
see
the
bigger
picture,
to
think
about
what
would
work
best
in
the
paper,
not
just
what
I
would
do.
By
reviewing
that
paper
I
learned
to
rethink
the
way
I
write,
and
began
approaching
my
work
more
objectively,
which
has
helped
me
with
the
organization
and
flow
of
my
writing.
The
second
category
of
skills
I
have
learned
recently
from
my
academic
and
Writing
Associate
experience
while
somewhat
less
exciting
than
the
more
abstract
arts
of
writing,
are
still
just
as
relevant
in
my
work.
During
my
second
semester
as
a
WA
I
worked
with
a
professor
who
could
generously
be
called
NdifficultO
to
work
with.
He
didnOt
think
WAs
were
very
valuable
and
was
nearly
impossible
to
contact.
The
class
pivoted
around
a
large,
long-term
research
project.
Each
student
wrote
a
proposal,
an
annotated
bibliography
and
finished
the
semester
with
a
long,
in
depth-analysis
on
the
subject
of
their
choice.
I
ascertained
from
the
professor,
during
one
of
the
few
opportunities
I
had
to
meet
him
in
person,
that
he
had
high
expectations
for
the
papers.
The
professor,
and
accomplished
researcher
and
writer
held
the
class
to
high
expectations,
and
he
was
vocally
unhappy
with
the
quality
of
the
proposals.
Naturally
it
fell
on
to
me
to
help
the
students
plan
out
their
research
projects.
The
meetings
about
the
paper
became
a
learning
project
for
me
too-I
had
never
written
such
a
long
and
intense
research
paper,
and
I
felt
a
lot
of
pressure
to
prove
the
value
of
the
College
Writing
Program
to
the
Professor.
I
never
had
to
prepare
for
conferences
as
much
as
I
had
for
those.
I
reviewed
the
St.
MartinOs
Handbook,
I
studied
the
assignment,
and
I
tried
to
learn
as
much
as
I
could
about
research
papers.
I
did
my
best
when
meeting
with
the
students.
It
seemed
like
most
of
them
just
wanted
someone
to
complain
to
about
the
difficulty
of
the
assignment.
I
did
my
best
to
teach
them
all
I
knew,
and
to
encourage
the
students
to
spend
as
much
time
on
the
paper
as
possible.
IOm
not
sure
how
the
projects
eventually
turned
out
but
the
process
definitely
helped
me
learn
a
lot
more
about
academic
research,
and
I
hope
that
I
imparted
that
knowledge
onto
the
students
I
was
working
with.
When
I
wrote
my
first
WA
essay
it
was
fascinating
for
me
to
see
the
ways
that
my
writing
changed
from
my
childhood
to
the
beginning
of
my
time
in
college.
Writing
is
not
a
static
process,
and
I
have
learned
that
audience
and
environmental
can
have
a
huge
impact
oneOs
writing.
I
spent
last
semester
studying
in
Hong
Kong,
and
one
of
the
first
things
I
noticed
at
the
university
was
the
difference
in
writing
styles
and
experience.
All
of
the
local
students
at
the
university
wrote
in
near-perfect
English
but
even
excluding
the
occasional
grammatical
error
I
could
still
tell
that
the
localsO
writing
style
was
very
different.
A
friend
of
mine
there
asked
me
to
proofread
some
of
his
papers
for
him,
and
I
was
happy
to
oblige.
Immediately
I
was
struck
by
the
more
meandering
tone
the
papers
took.
His
writing,
while
thoughtful
and
clear
had
a
tendency
to
veer
off
course
and
took
a
somewhat
roundabout
way
to
the
point.
My
experience
writing
and
editing
for
the
newspaper
taught
me
the
importance
of
being
clear
in
concise
in
writing,
and
I
found
it
challenging
to
explain
the
concept
to
my
friend,
who
saw
the
less
direct
style
as
the
norm.
My
own
work
began
to
take
on
characteristics
of
my
new
writing
culture.
After
receiving
less-than-ideal
grades
on
my
own
work
I
tried
to
incorporate
the
local
studentsO
writing
style.
I
found
that
a
less
direct
style
and
much
longer
papers
were
received
much
more
favorably
by
my
professors.
The
university
in
Hong
Kong,
it
seemed,
preferred
quantity
over
quality.
Before
my
trip
to
Hong
Kong
I
was
unaware
how
cultural
differences
permeated
writing,
and
I
hope
that
the
skills
I
learned
in
crossing
those
cultural
boundaries
can
be
used
in
my
work
as
a
Writing
Associate.
I
am
a
little
concerned
that
these
bad
habits
may
have
followed
me
back
to
Lafayette,
but
I
hope
that
I
will
be
able
to
recognize
and
overcome
them.
One
of
my
professors
at
Hong
Kong,
an
American,
did
teach
me
an
important
lesson
about
academic
research
that
I
plan
to
use
as
a
WA.
He
assigned
a
packet
of
primary
sources
pertaining
to
the
decision
to
use
atomic
weapons
against
Japan
at
the
close
of
World
War
II.
It
seemed
like
a
simple
assignment;
I
didnOt
think
it
could
be
very
difficult
to
write
a
research
paper
if
the
research
was
already
done
for
us.
After
perusing
the
packet
I
quickly
figured
out
what
the
catch
was
D
many
of
the
sources
contradicted
each
other,
our
job
was
to
evaluate
the
sources
and
determine
which
were
the
most
historically
reliable.
Are
presidential
diary
entries
written
with
assumed
privacy,
or
with
the
assumption
that
they
may
one
day
be
revealed
publicly?
Whose
word
can
you
trust?
The
assignment
was
challenging,
and
required
a
lot
of
critical
thinking
that
is
normally
absent
in
most
research
papers.
I
probably
spent
more
time
on
that
assignment
than
I
ever
have
writing
research
papers.
The
analysis
was
challenging,
but
very
eye
opening
into
the
world
of
research.
I
learned
that
a
writer
canOt
always
trust
every
source,
and
that
good
research
sometimes
has
to
assume
that
some
primary
sources
might
be
contradictory;
it
seems
like
a
logical
assumption,
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
before.
Although
the
lesson
is
content
based,
I
still
think
it
can
be
used
in
my
work
as
WA.
Too
often
WAs
overlook
important
content
issues
that
are
as
much
a
part
of
good
writing
as
grammar
is.
Research
papers
make
up
a
large
percent
of
the
work
that
Writing
Associates
do,
and
itOs
good
to
have
parts
other
than
the
thesis
to
concentrate
on.
Since
becoming
a
WA,
and
even
since
beginning
my
college
career
I
have
learned
a
lot
about
writing
and
editing.
ItOs
not
always
a
simple
process,
and
a
writer
has
to
make
tough
decisions
about
what
to
include
in
a
paper,
and
how
to
structure
it.
The
experiences
IOve
had
over
the
past
two
years
have
helped
me
to
become
a
better
writer.
Experience
with
the
more
abstract
ideas
of
writing,
like
organization
and
the
art
of
the
conference
are
important
for
WAs,
but
just
as
relevant
are
the
real-world
experiences
and
specific
knowledge
that
a
WA
could
use
to
help
others
write
better.
In
the
past
two
years
IOve
become
more
practiced
in
looking
at
my
own
work
more
objectively;
IOve
learned
the
intricacies
of
the
WA
conference,
and
how
to
deal
with
difficult
professors.
The
wide
range
of
papers
IOve
read
has
expanded
my
writing
experience.
In-depth
research
papers,
analysis
of
childrenOs
literature,
and
the
work
of
non-native
English
speakers
each
taught
me
something
about
the
writing
process.
The
things
a
WA
learns
donOt
always
come
in
ways
one
would
expect.
A
Writing
Associate
learns
from
the
students
he
works
with,
and
takes
lessons
away
from
the
diverse
number
of
assignments
and
ideas
he
comes
across.
ItOs
not
always
easy
to
be
a
WA,
and
it
can
demand
a
lot
from
a
person,
but
the
experience
can
be
rewarding.
For
new
WAs
just
beginning
their
experience
the
most
important
piece
of
advice
I
can
offer
is
to
be
open
to
new
ideas
and
new
ways
of
doing
things.
DonOt
see
the
students
as
writers
who
need
guidance,
but
as
people
who
can
provide
a
WA
with
valuable
experience
and
perspective.
The
knowledge
and
improved
writing
that
comes
from
being
a
WA,
will
materialize,
but
most
of
it
comes
from
hands-on
experience
that
canOt
be
transmitted
through
books
or
lessons.
