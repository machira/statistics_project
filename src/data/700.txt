I
canOt
recall
exactly
when
it
was
that
I
started
to
form
words.
The
act
of
putting
crayon
to
paper
was
an
arduous
process:
the
extracting
of
the
crayon
from
its
box,
opening
up
my
fatherOs
world
atlas,
racking
my
three-year-old
mind
for
inspiration.
Oftentimes
my
father
would
find
me
on
the
floor
of
our
living
room,
my
left
hand
quaking
as
my
fingers
traced
unintelligible
shapes
along
the
outlines
of
continents.
A
four-legged
ant
reposing
on
Morocco,
a
fuzzy
spider
afloat
on
the
Indian
Ocean,
and
my
father
would
pat
me
on
the
head
before
placing
his
atlases
high
upon
a
bookshelf,
beyond
my
reach.
From
shapes
came
words.
Fat
pencils
would
be
positioned
in
my
chubby
right
hand,
and
I
would
promptly
drop
them.
NWrite,O
my
mother
would
urge,
tracing
letters
D
in
English
and
Bengali
D
on
scrap
paper,
expecting
me
to
follow
suit.
I
would
swap
my
pencil,
grip
it
confidently
in
my
left
hand,
much
to
the
befuddlement
of
my
mother.
NThis
one,
this
one
is
different,O
my
grandmother
would
boom,
rapping
my
knuckles
with
the
back
of
a
wooden
spatula.
NThe
first
in
the
family.O
Left-handedness,
it
seems,
was
akin
to
a
family
disgrace.
And
soon
enough,
a
societal
one.
The
first
day
of
kindergarten,
after
introductions
were
made
and
seats
were
assigned,
my
teacher
found
me
lingering
by
her
table.
NWhatOs
the
matter?O
she
asked,
and
I
pointed
to
the
desks.
Thirty
right-handed
desks,
facing
the
sunny
window
of
the
brick-and-mortar
classroom,
and
no
seat
for
me.
NI
have
nowhere
to
sit.O
My
teacher,
perplexed,
rang
up
my
mother
to
ask
what
could
be
done.
The
next
week
a
left-handed
desk
was
procured,
an
oddity
in
the
room,
positioned
in
an
angle
so
that
my
elbow
wouldnOt
bump
into
those
of
my
more
reasonable
classmates.
NWhy
donOt
you
just
try
writing
with
your
right
hand?O
my
teacher
asked
me,
the
relative
simplicity
of
the
writing
habits
of
my
other
classmates
clearly
more
desirable
than
my
need
to
be
different.
NI
canOt,O
I
told
her,
and
when
she
called
me
up
to
the
blackboard
to
spell
my
good
name
(my
official
name,
my
school
name,
the
name
that
would
go
on
my
transcripts
and
my
passport
and
my
report
cards,
a
name
that
was
yet
unknown
to
me)
I
looked
at
her
blankly
and
she
sent
me
back,
while
my
classmates
sniggered
with
their
hands
cupped
over
their
mouths.
My
struggle
to
assert
myself
as
a
left-handed
non-conformist
in
a
sea
of
right-handed
normal
people
went
along
the
same
vein
as
the
concept
of
reconciling
my
Ngood
nameO
persona
to
my
Npet
name
one.O
In
accordance
to
Bengali
culture,
my
parents
christened
me
with
two
names
D
one
to
be
called
at
home,
amongst
family,
a
term
of
endearment.
And
then
there
was
my
second
name,
my
other
name,
a
name
cobbled
together
by
my
father
in
a
stroke
of
inspiration,
a
name
with
no
roots
in
either
Bengali
or
Islamic
culture:
Shehtaz.
A
name
that
I
could
not
spell
when
first
learning
the
English
alphabet,
getting
my
zOs
backwards,
stumbling
over
the
two
syllables.
And
then,
as
I
proceeded
through
elementary
school,
the
nagging
need
to
correct
the
frequent
mispronunciations,
the
stress
on
the
second
NhO
and
the
emphasis
on
the
NzO
(NNo,
itOs
not
ShehtajO).
The
mispronunciations
lingered,
past
elementary
school
and
into
my
voyage
to
America,
and
I
brought
to
Texas
my
exotic
name
and
my
familyOs
apprehensions
about
my
intent
to
become
a
writer.
I
had
decided
quite
early
on
that
I
wanted
to
be
a
writer.
When
I
was
eight,
a
head
injury
left
me
virtually
bed-ridden.
Forbidden
to
see
the
light
of
day,
to
play
with
the
neighborhood
kids
or
accompany
my
parents
to
the
store
or
on
family
visits,
I
whiled
away
the
endless
hours
doodling
in
my
pink
heart-shaped
diary,
a
gift
from
my
father.
I
wrote
page-long
entries,
dating
them
at
the
top,
starting
off
my
thoughts
with
NDear
Diary,O
writing
in
English
even
as
the
rest
of
my
family
spoke
Bengali
around
me.
I
started
to
think
bilingually,
and
the
more
I
wrote
the
more
I
felt
that
I
was
having
a
first-graderOs
version
of
an
inner
monologue.
I
spoke
to
myself
D
in
my
head,
and
sometimes
out
loud
D
in
English,
and
wrote
to
myself
in
English,
and
made
it
a
point
to
find
Nickelodeon
and
Cartoon
Network
on
television
so
that
I
could
watch
Hey
Arnold
and
The
Rugrats
and
DexterOs
Laboratory,
letting
the
syntax
sink
in,
letting
the
language
seep
into
my
porous
little
mind.
I
grew
an
affinity
for
the
language.
Speaking
it
and
writing
it,
honing
my
grasp
of
it
even
when
I
didnOt
need
to.
I
spent
twelve
years
in
a
private
English-medium
school,
where
even
though
the
mandated
language
of
teaching
was
meant
to
be
English
the
rules
never
quite
stuck.
And
the
whole
while
I
went
about
my
business,
exhausting
one
diary
after
the
next,
exploring
the
vista
that
Microsoft
Word
opened
up
to
me,
navigating
the
keyboard.
Oftentimes
my
mother
would
find
me
in
the
near
dark,
my
nine-year-old
feet
dangling
a
few
inches
off
the
floor
as
I
camped
out
on
her
swivel
chair,
the
glow
of
her
computer
bluish-white
on
my
face.
NIOm
typing,O
I
told
her,
and
she
would
nod
and
turn
on
the
lights
and
let
me
be.
Writing
was
a
way
to
cope
with
my
injury-bound
exile.
Writing
in
English
was
a
way
to
escape.
Seeking
refuge
in
a
second
language,
probing
the
depths
of
words
and
their
myriad
meanings,
became
woven
into
my
days.
Twenty-two
diaries
and
a
dozen
essay
competitions
later,
my
parents
had
to
acknowledge
that
I
had
something
of
a
Nwriting
streakO
within
me.
NItOs
all
she
wants
to
do,O
they
told
their
friends,
torn
between
encouragement
and
concern.
NBut
what
is
to
come
of
this?
Writing
wonOt
get
her
into
college.
She
needs
to
be
a
doctor,
an
engineer,
a
fixer.
Writing
is
for
dreamers.O
I
was
vehemently
opposed
to
that
train
of
thinking.
I
had
no
qualms
with
being
a
fixer,
but
I
shunned
science
and
math
with
a
vengeance,
switching
out
of
ninth-grade
Pure
Mathematics
to
become
the
fourth
person
in
my
grade
to
take
English
Literature.
I
applied
to
the
only
English
teen
magazine,
three
months
before
my
sixteenth
birthday,
and
became
the
youngest
person
to
be
employed.
Every
Thursday
I
spent
an
hour
and
a
half
in
a
frigid,
air-conditioned
conference
room,
sitting
around
an
oval
table
as
people
five,
ten
years
older
than
me
planned
issues
and
made
suggestions
and
cobbled
together
layouts.
I
was
one
of
those
voices,
my
name
appearing
in
print
almost
every
week,
floating
beneath
blocks
of
text.
From
celebrity
news
to
reviews
to
cover
stories,
I
dabbled
with
it
all,
before
finally
finding
my
niche
in
autobiographical
fiction.
To
write
about
life
as
I
knew
it,
in
a
voice
that
was
mine
and
yet
wasnOt
quite,
was
a
liberating
window,
a
short-lived
escape
from
the
humdrum
days
of
school
and
homework
and
the
crushing
expectation
to
be
something
that
I
knew
I
could
not
be.
Writing
became
a
vehicle.
Writing
was
my
rebellion.
I
wrote,
partly
because
it
was
undesirable
territory,
partly
because
the
thrill
of
tapping
into
something
that
was
both
uniquely
mine
and
yet
a
shared
experience
was
intoxicating.
I
wrote,
essays
for
board
exams
and
articles
for
my
work,
and
when
I
came
to
America
I
wrote
for
my
Pre-Advanced
Placement
English
class,
which
was
where
IOd
first
heard
of
a
thesis
statement.
I
learned
about
ethos
and
pathos
and
logos,
not
just
the
rote
learning
of
similes
and
idioms
and
other
figures
of
speech.
I
read
books
for
school
that
would
have
been
considered
indecent
in
the
English
curriculum
of
my
high
school
in
Bangladesh,
books
like
Catcher
in
the
Rye
and
To
Kill
a
Mockingbird.
We
discussed
in
AP
English
Language
things
that
would
have
never
come
up
in
my
literature
classes
in
Bangladesh,
drugs
and
sex
and
teenage
angst,
things
that
were
analyzed
and
dissected
and
deconstructed.
Mr.
Brissman,
my
eleventh-grade
English
teacher,
made
it
all
right
for
his
students
to
pepper
his
classes
with
questions,
insights,
even
the
occasional
random
comment
or
two.
After
all,
he
would
often
stay
back
so
that
stragglers
could
come
in
and
perch
themselves
on
top
of
the
desks
and
while
away
after-school
hours
talking
about
stuffed
frogs
and
how
to
make
rocks
talk.
He
taught
me
the
art
of
writing,
but
in
a
different
way.
His
style
was
about
crafting
a
voice,
not
the
step-by-step
breakdown
of
the
AP
grading
rubric.
NI
donOt
want
you
to
write
essays
to
get
that
5
on
your
AP
score,O
he
would
tell
us.
NI
want
you
to
get
something
more
out
of
this.O
NWhat
exactly,
Mr.
Brissman?O
I
asked
him
once,
after
his
eighth-period
class
had
dispelled,
and
Mr.
Brissman
was
in
the
process
of
switching
his
screensaver
from
that
of
cats
to
a
cartoon
frog.
NYou
need
to
think
of
writing
as
something
done
not
for
this
class,
or
for
the
AP
test
in
May,O
he
told
me.
NYou
need
to
think
of
this
as
a
stepping
stone,
a
way
to
broaden
your
scope.
Crafting
your
voice,
working
on
your
analytical
skills.
Will
you
ever
need
to
write
a
five-page
paper
on
A
Farewell
to
Arms
in
a
corporate
job?
Probably
not.
But
will
you
need
to
think
on
your
feet,
to
put
disjointed
thoughts
together,
to
make
an
argument
right
on
your
feet?
Probably.
And
thatOs
what
writing,
writing
well,
will
prepare
you
for.O
I
took
his
advice.
I
worked
at
my
papers,
trying
not
to
cater
my
essays
to
my
phantom
grader.
For
the
timed
practice
essays
that
we
had
to
write
in
class,
I
tried
to
keep
in
mind
Mr.
BrissmanOs
patchwork
quilt
of
advice.
Voice,
tone,
inflection.
I
dropped
fragmented
sentences
into
my
prose,
enjoying
the
flow
of
my
disjointed
thoughts,
even
when
my
papers
came
back
underlined
in
Mr.
BrissmanOs
purple
pen
with
comments
on
the
margins
like
NFragment?
Perhaps
complete
your
thought?O
I
toned
down
my
affinity
for
incomplete
thoughts,
a
concession
to
the
AP
grading
rubric,
but
they
did
not
disappear.
Mr.
Brissman
let
them
slide,
even
as
he
stressed
the
importance
of
maintaining
grammatical
structure,
knowing
that
for
all
his
talks
on
personal
voice
and
tone
he
would
be
wrong
to
suggest
his
students
try
to
fit
into
the
mold
of
a
high-scoring,
AP-paper-writing
pro.
My
scores
on
my
AP
English
test
enabled
me
to
test
out
of
College
Writing
110.
When
my
acceptance
letter
from
Lafayette
College
found
itself
on
my
table,
a
thick
manila
envelope
with
endless
brochures
and
catalogs,
I
knew
that
I
was
ready
for
college.
I
was
ready
to
board
a
plane
and
leave
behind
my
adopted
homestead,
the
trimmed
lawns
and
the
strip
malls
and
the
sprawling
red-brick
high
school
for
Easton,
Pennsylvania.
The
May
of
my
senior
year
I
wrote
endless
yearbook
inscriptions
to
my
friends,
wishing
them
the
best
of
luck
and
penning
remnants
of
fond
memories,
and
I
wrote
my
way
into
my
tentative
first
taste
of
freedom.
I
signed
the
dotted
line,
mailed
off
my
acceptance,
left
cards
and
thank-you
notes
in
the
sleeves
of
envelopes.
I
wrote
to
my
friends
back
in
Bangladesh
D
snail
mail,
postmarked
and
smudged
from
the
ink
of
my
pen
D
about
this
moment
in
my
life.
Our
futures
were
taking
shape,
intangible
no
doubt,
and
it
was
easier
not
to
fret
just
yet.
It
was
easier
to
let
my
penmanship
fill
up
sheets
of
single-lined
notebook
paper,
to
bequeath
pieces
of
my
American
life
to
my
Bengali
one,
before
a
giant
metal
bird
took
me
to
a
different
life
altogether.
I
came
to
college
not
knowing
what
to
expect,
getting
lost
on
my
way
to
the
bathroom,
walking
into
someone
elseOs
dorm.
I
put
up
my
dry-erase
calendar
up
on
the
wall,
the
dates
written
in
red,
the
frenzied
schedule
of
orientation
week
tacked
haphazardly
to
the
board.
I
wrote
in
appointments
and
advisor
meetings
and
events,
and
every
addition
was
a
milestone.
The
first
weeks
of
classes,
the
first
assignments,
the
first-year
seminar
workshop
on
what
was
to
be
expected
of
a
college
paper,
the
clueless
traipses
through
the
aisles
of
Skillman
Library
D
finding
my
bearing,
in
short
D
kept
me
in
a
mild
state
of
panic.
NI
donOt
know
what
to
do,O
I
told
my
mother
over
the
phone,
in
the
first
weeks
of
my
freshman
year.
And
my
mother,
born
in
a
different
land,
under
a
different
time,
could
not
tell
me
how
to
be.
NIt
will
pass,O
she
said.
NYou
will
get
the
hang
of
things.O
But
when
the
first
deadline
came
creeping
up
on
the
horizon,
and
writerOs
block
left
my
fingers
paralyzed
on
the
well-worn
keys
of
my
beloved
laptop,
I
was
at
a
complete
loss.
Coffee
and
a
yogurt
parfait
and
three
hours
in
the
tomato-red
chairs
of
SkillmanOs
upper
level
produced
my
first
five-page
endeavor
at
a
college
paper.
Comparative
art
in
pre-World
War
I
Europe,
and
I
had
spent
many
hours
skimming
through
glossy
art
textbooks
and
lingering
outside
my
professorOs
office
door,
trying
to
get
a
grasp
on
this
alien
prompt.
About
thirty-odd
papers
and
a
year
of
college
later,
I
am
no
seasoned
pro
at
writing.
I
sense
that
my
voice
has
changed,
that
my
style
is
different
from
my
days
of
high
school
Advanced
Placement
English.
The
assignment
deadlines
from
my
two
majors
keep
me
producing
papers
on
a
regular
basis.
I
know
how
itOs
done,
and
how
to
turn
in
assignments
to
Moodle
without
incurring
the
wrath
of
my
English
professors.
I
am
occasionally
summoned
by
my
friends
to
peer-edit
their
papers.
Friends
still
in
high
school
email
me
their
college
essays
in
a
frenzied
panic,
asking
for
advice,
reminding
me
of
myself.
Film
screenings
for
my
World
Cinema
class
had
me
looking
for
text
in
dialogue,
and
Literary
Questions
had
me
redefining
the
nature
of
text
itself.
As
summer
rolls
into
fall
semester,
and
preparations
for
sophomore
way
start
trickling
into
my
agenda,
I
look
back
on
my
freshman
year.
I
think
of
the
panic,
the
frenzy,
the
disorientation,
and
know
that
the
madness
will
continue.
Except
now
that
I
will
be
a
Writing
Associate,
at
the
giving
end
of
the
advice,
and
even
as
I
embark
on
this
endeavor
I
will
have
my
friends
to
take
this
plunge
with
me,
and
my
beloved
Toshiba
laptop
D
with
its
well-worn
keys,
and
its
memories
of
countless
words
D
to
keep
me
sane.
