WA
Literary
Narrative
So
here
I
am,
sitting
in
fifth
grade
amongst
my
classmates
that
I
have
known
since
pre-school.
Things
today
just
did
not
run
their
usual
course.
All
the
years
prior
to
now,
I
was
praised
for
my
exceptional
work
and
creative
writing.
Now
as
I
stared
at
my
first
English
assignment,
I
realized
that
perhaps
the
praises
were
nothing
more
than
slight
exaggerations
of
the
truth.
Mrs.
Gold
had
given
me,
Sefcik,
previous
straight-A
student,
a
C!
I
felt
my
eyes
begin
to
swell
with
tears,
as
if
they
were
two
giant
rain
clouds
waiting
to
explode.
I
would
not
let
anyone
see
me
upset
like
this,
so
I
fought
crying
until
I
got
home
that
afternoon.
To
my
amazement,
my
paper
looked
like
it
had
just
undergone
a
messy
surgery
with
red
blood
marks
all
over
it!
My
teacher's
corrections
crushed
my
self-esteem
to
an
all-time
low.
Her
comments
included
simple
suggestions
like
"use
stronger
vocabulary"
to
more
critical
remarks
such
as
"weak
idea"
and
"needs
more
creativity."
This
was
my
first
experience
with
what
is
called
"constructive
criticism."
I
was
not
ready
to
hear
that
my
hard
work
wasn't
good
enough.
I
had
spent
numerous
hours
on
that
assignment
and
for
me
to
get
a
C
was
just
plain
ridiculous.
Even
the
under-achieving
students
received
C's,
placing
me
on
their
level.
I
was
an
over-achiever!
I
learned
that
if
I
wanted
to
get
an
A
in
the
class,
I
would
have
to
conference
with
Mrs.
Gold,
find
out
exactly
what
she
was
looking
for
in
a
paper,
and
adapt
my
writing
style
accordingly.
Hoping
to
please
Mrs.
Gold,
I
took
her
criticism
and
used
it
to
work
to
my
full
potential.
On
the
last
day
of
class,
Mrs.
Gold
approached
me
and
told
me
privately
that
she
was
going
to
retire
after
that
year.
I
was
really
upset
about
her
leaving
because
I
was
actually
looking
forward
to
having
her
again
for
English
in
sixth
grade,
even
though
I
absolutely
hated
her
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
for
giving
me
a
C.
Mrs.
Gold
filled
me
in
on
a
little
secret
that
afternoon.
She
had
explained
to
me
how
she
had
heard
about
my
perfectionist
attitude
as
a
student
prior
to
having
me
in
class
and
she
was
determined
to
teach
me
how
to
relax
and
not
be
afraid
of
failure.
Therefore,
she
had
given
me
a
C
on
the
first
paper
although
she
said
I
truly
deserved
an
A
in
comparison
to
the
rest
of
the
class!
My
immediate
reaction
was
anger
and
I
just
wanted
to
scream.
How
could
she
have
made
me
work
so
hard
all
year
long
to
get
the
grade
that
I
simply
deserved
all
along?
Before
I
could
say
a
word,
this
powerful,
yet
graceful
woman
standing
before
me
leaned
in
and
gave
me
a
hug.
And
for
that
moment,
she
was
not
my
teacher,
but
my
friend.
I
learned
a
lot
about
myself
that
year,
and
to
this
day,
Mrs.
Gold
and
I
still
keep
in
touch,
however,
there
was
no
greater
reward
from
that
experience
than
watching
myself
evolve
as
a
strong
and
confident
writer.
It
was
then
I
noticed
my
passion
for
writing
and
just
how
successful
I
could
be
with
a
little
determination
and
hard
work.
The
next
year
was
basically
just
a
lot
of
practice
for
me.
Sixth
grade
was
the
highest
grade
our
elementary
school
housed,
so
it
was
a
big
deal
to
move
on
to
Middle
School
for
grades
seven
and
eight.
The
transition
was
similar
to
starting
high
school
and
going
off
to
college:
new
and
unforeseen
challenges
lie
ahead.
I
realized
then
the
potential
I
had
to
write,
so
I
started
to
use
my
free
time
to
express
my
thoughts.
I
began
a
journal
and
in
it
was
included
everything:
home
information,
school
stories,
and
of
course,
boys.
I
also
had
a
special
section
devoted
to
poetry,
where
I
would
try
to
capture
vivid
inspirations
in
an
abstract
way.
My
new
English
teacher
actually
noticed
that
I
had
written
some
exceptional
poems
for
a
few
class
assignments
and
asked
me
if
I
ever
considered
publishing.
Publishing?
Was
she
crazy?
I
was
only
twelve
years
old!
But
to
my
amazement
there
was
a
book
designed
especially
for
young
writers
like
myself.
It
was
called
the
Anthology
of
Poetry
by
Young
Americans.
I
believe
that
3
of
my
poems
were
published
in
the
edition
that
year,
and
in
doing
so,
my
confidence
in
writing
only
grew.
Moving
on
to
Middle
School
was
a
pretty
big
step.
Not
only
did
we
have
to
adjust
socially,
but
we
also
had
to
adapt
academically.
Instead
of
4
classes,
there
was
now
8
periods
in
the
day.
Naturally,
the
work
got
harder
and
the
inevitable
pressure
of
standardized
tests
fell
upon
us.
For
those
two
years,
I
changed
my
writing
style
to
conform
to
the
protocols
of
the
test,
called
the
EWT
or
Early
Warning
Test.
It
was
no
longer
appropriate
to
write
aimlessly
and
creatively
about
any
topic
I
so
desired.
I
was
forced
to
learn
to
how
to
write
a
five-paragraph
essay
in
forty
minutes
on
a
topic
I
had
no
control
over.
Sounds
pretty
difficult,
huh?
Well,
I
happened
to
think
so
at
the
time,
but
like
anything
else,
a
little
hard
work
would
fix
the
problem.
I
practiced
all
different
types
of
essays,
persuasive,
argumentative,
problem/solution,
and
informative,
until
I
was
confident
enough
in
my
ability
to
not
only
pass,
but
ace
the
test.
(I
never
said
my
perfectionism
was
cured!)
I
eventually
took
the
test
and
wrote
what
I
thought
was
an
excellent
essay
in
only
forty
minutes.
Apparently,
the
testing
staff
enjoyed
my
piece
as
well,
and
I
received
a
perfect
score!
I
was
extremely
excited
that
I
was
able
to
master
yet
another
style
of
writing,
and
with
that,
I
anxiously
awaited
high
school.
The
real
work
started
in
ninth
grade
when
I
enrolled
in
an
honors
English
course.
My
teacher,
Mr.
Sheridan,
assigned
us
random
articles
and
some
classic
books
to
read
that
year.
The
work
was
basically
split
between
fiction
and
non-fiction,
and
the
class
discussions
were
always
intuitive.
Mr.
Sheridan,
however,
did
not
believe
in
multiple
choice
or
other
objective-style
tests.
He
felt
that
essays
were
the
only
true
way
of
measuring
how
well
you
read
the
book
because
information
was
not
provided
to
you
on
the
writing
paper.
To
master
his
class,
I
found
myself
memorizing
a
lot
of
information,
from
character
names
to
specific
events
and
times
and
simply
regurgitating
them
to
paper
on
the
day
of
the
test.
I
was
basically
just
writing
plot
summaries
and
surface
material,
which
was
rather
mundane
and
uncreative.
Sophomore
year
I
took
yet
another
enriched
course
entitled
World
Studies.
Primarily,
we
would
read
works
of
fiction
and
nonfiction
written
by
foreign
authors
and
about
distant
lands
and
cultures.
My
teacher,
Mrs.
Callendar,
felt
that
objective
tests
were
the
most
comprehensive
and
appropriate
ways
of
assessing
our
knowledge
on
a
particular
topic.
Therefore,
I
did
not
do
any
substantial
amount
of
writing
for
the
entire
year.
I
did,
however,
keep
up
with
my
journal
writing
and
I
even
composed
several
more
poems,
which
I
created
a
special
book
for.
At
this
time,
my
younger
brother
was
going
through
Middle
School
and
likewise
preparing
for
the
Early
Warning
Tests.
He
does
not
enjoy
writing
and
never
did
exceptionally
well
in
his
English
classes.
He
had
asked
me
to
help
him
write
both
knowledgeably
and
expeditiously
so
he
could
score
well
on
the
exam.
So
in
comparison
to
the
Writing
Associate's
job,
I
behaved
as
a
W
A
to
my
brother.
He
would
write
various
essays
and
I
would
proofread
and
comment
on
their
strengths
and
weaknesses.
Not
only
did
he
improve
his
writing,
but
he
also
helped
me
to
better
understand
and
appreciate
the
composition
styles
of
other
writers.
Having
Mr.
Sheridan
again
in
my
junior
year,
I
knew
what
to
expect.
Although
we
read
many
more
books,
the
style
of
the
tests
did
not
change
at
all;
they
were
still
all
essay
exams.
I
found
myself
recalling
information
and
simply
copying
it
all
to
the
test
papers.
I
always
did
well
in
that
class
because
he
was
not
asking
for
much
analysis
or
creativity.
I
found
that
simply
spitting
out
facts
took
a
lot
less
time
and
thought,
and
so
I
never
stressed
out
about
really
reading
into
the
stories
themselves.
My
essays
seemed
perfectly
acceptable
at
the
time,
but
I
was
in
for
an
unexpected
surprise.
My
senior
year,
I
enrolled
in
AP
English,
taught
by
a
fairly
new
teacher
to
the
school
system.
Only
three
years
out
of
graduate
school,
her
ideas
seemed
very
modem
and
she
wanted
to
conduct
the
class
in
a
coming-of-age
manner.
This
meant
deviating
from
the
styles
of
writing
that
we
were
all
most
familiar
with
in
order
to
try
some
innovative
masterpieces.
The
problem
was
that
she
did
not
have
time
to
inform
us
of
these
teaching
methods
prior
to
the
first
test,
which
fell
on
the
second
day
of
the
school
year.
When
I
received
the
essay
exam
back
the
following
week,
I
once
again
saw
a
large
red
C
on
the
top
of
the
paper!
The
sight
was
all
too
familiar
and
it
just
insinuated
that
another
year
of
intense
writing
was
in
store
for
me,
but
this
time
the
rest
of
my
classmates
had
also
performed
way
under
their
own
averages.
Shocked,
we
conducted
a
class
discussion
with
our
teacher
who
then
explained
to
us
exactly
what
she
was
going
to
be
looking
for
in
our
writing.
Basically,
she
told
us
that
all
of
our
writing
skills
and
styles
were
out
of
date
and
not
adept
enough
for
the
college
level.
Our
skills
gained
from
previous
assignments
of
plot
summaries
and
repeated
information
were
out
of
date
and
obsolete
in
this
class.
Now,
we
were
going
to
analyze
the
obscure
information.
The
days
of
skimming
novels
were
over
and
now
I
found
myself
deeply
reading
every
single
sentence
of
the
books.
Although
the
work
was
demanding
and
I
was
forced
to
learn
yet
another
style
of
writing,
I
became
more
aware
of
the
themes
and
the
deeper
meanings
that
encompasses
every
piece
of
literature.
I
realized
that
I
was
missing
the
point
in
a
lot
of
the
stories
I
read
because
I
was
only
absorbing
the
obvious
material,
and
not
looking
for
what
hidden
meanings
could
exist.
This
was
probably
the
most
valuable
lesson
that
I
received
about
college
level
writing.
So
one
day
I
am
a
high
school
student
and
the
next
I
find
myself
in
college.
I
ask
myself,
"Am
I
prepared
for
the
challenges
ahead?"
I
believe
I
was
prepared
to
the
fullest
extent.
Having
graduated
as
valedictorian,
I
was
confident
that
I
would
succeed
in
college.
I
am
still
certain
that
I
am
going
to
succeed
here
at
Lafayette
College;
however,
my
first
year
proved
that
it
is
going
to
take
a
lot
more
work
than
I
had
expected.
Coming
from
a
very
small
high
school,
the
classes
were
challenging
but
not
as
rigorous
as
the
course
the
friends
I
met
were
used
to
taking
in
their
respective
high
schools.
The
first
day
in
my
First
Year
Seminar
when
my
professor
told
us
we
would
be
writing
two
ten
page
papers
during
the
semester,
I
think
I
gasped
out
loud!
I
had
never
written
a
five-page
paper,
let
alone
ten
pages.
I
began
to
stress
about
the
assignment
and
thought,
"How
am
I
ever
going
to
get
this
accomplished?"
Soon
I
relaxed
and
realized
that
the
assignment
would
not
be
so
difficult
if
I
just
used
all
of
the
writing
lessons
taught
throughout
the
years.
Much
to
my
amazement,
when
I
completed
the
paper,
it
actually
turned
out
to
be
not
ten,
but
15
pages
long!
The
most
gratifying
part
of
the
process
was
when
I
found
out
my
professor
gave
me
an
A!
The
FYS
is
the
only
writing
experience
I
have
had
thus
far
at
Lafayette,
but
I
am
sure
it
will
not
be
the
last.
Well,
that
is
my
history
as
a
writer.
I
am
even
gaining
experience
as
I
sit
here
now
and
write
this
narrative.
Eight
years
ago
when
I
was
sitting
in
Mrs.
Gold's
class,
I
would
have
been
horrified
if
I
was
assigned
a
seven
page
essay
that
was
due
in
only
two
days.
But
here
I
am,
expeditiously
typing
away
at
the
computer,
trying
to
sum
up
nineteen
years
of
my
life
in
only
seven
pages.
Without
the
skills
that
I
have
learned
and
applied
to
the
best
of
my
ability,
this
paper
would
not
even
exist.
Writing
is
such
an
important
part
of
our
daily
lives
and
it
is
often
taken
for
granted
how
each
one
of
us
exists
as
an
author.
Regardless
of
how
we
all
learned
to
read
and
write,
we
all
finally
developed
our
own
unique
styles
of
writing.
Being
a
W
A
this
semester
will
prove
to
be
a
most
enjoyable
experience,
as
I
will
use
it
as
an
opportunity
not
only
to
better
my
own
composition
techniques,
but
also
to
reflect
on
the
past
and
appreciate
how
far
my
writing
has
come
throughout
the
years.
