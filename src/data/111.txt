My
Personal
Writing
History
From
Crayons
to
the
Laptop
I've
been
asked
when
I
first
learned
to
walk
or
speak,
but
never,
until
now,
have
I
ever
been
asked
to
recall
when
I
first
learned
to
write.
I
suppose
it
was
a
lot
like
we
I
was
learning
to
walk
or
speak.
I
staggered
or
slurred
often
at
first,
but
slowly
I
got
the
hang
of
it.
I
started
with
just
the
basics...my
name,
MOM,
DAD,
DYDEE(the
name
of
my
favorite
teddy
bear)
et
cetera.
Eventually
I
graduated
to
full
sentences,
paragraphs
and
before
I
knew
it.,
.book
reports!
In
later
years
I
would
move
on
to
other
types
of
writing
such
as
lab
reports,
research
papers
and
essays.
Although
I
didn't
realize
it
at
the
time,
all
of
this
preparation
would
help
me
out
further
down
the
road.
Book
reports
and
phonics
are
the
building
blocks
of
my
writing
ability
that
I
have
today!
A
trendy
hobby
of
urban
youth
is
to
mark
their
territory
by
spray
painting
their
name
on
a
specific
area,
usually
a
side
of
a
building,
bridge
or
sidewalk.
Using
an
assortment
of
colors
and
artistry,
they
consume
large
areas
of
space
on
public
edifices
to
leave
their"
tag!'
When
I
was
younger,
I
shared
a
similar
experience.
My
earliest
memory
of
my
first
writing
act
occurred
in
the
upstairs
family
room
of
my
house
in
Needham.
I
had
just
learned
to
write
my
name
and
I
decided
to'tag'my
family's
home.
Using
red
crayon,
I
scribbled
the
five
letters
of
my
name
across
the
mantle
of
the
upstairs
fireplace.
I
was
so
proud
of
what
I
was
now
able
to
accomplish
that
I
didn't
realize
I
had
done
anything
wrong.
Although
I
can't
remember
the
consequences
of
my
act,
I'm
sure
my
parents
weren't
too
happy
with
the
display
of
my
new
ability,
or
at
least
where
I
chose
to
display
it.
After
that
incident,
my
earliest
memories
of
writing
occurred
in
Mrs.
Mahoney's
kindergarten
class.
I
remember
the
first
day
of
class.
Each
student
was
assigned
a
cubby
for
their
lunch
box
and
jacket
and
we
each
received
a
box
of
new
Crayola
crayons.
The
box
was
flat,
6x6
inches
with
green
and
gold
packaging
on
the
outside.
Inside
lay
six,
fat,
perfectly
sharpened
crayons.
For
that
academic
year,
these
would
be
my
writing
tools.
Being
careful
not
to
break
any,
I
would
use
them
everyday
to
complete
class
work.
My
favorite
assignment
was
when
we
were
given
paper
books
with
the
storyline
already
written
in
with
dotted
lines.
We
were
told
to
trace
the
dotted
lines
in
order
to
familiarize
ourselves
with
the
letters
and
words
and
when
we
were
finished,
we
were
allowed
to
go
back
and
color
in
the
pictures.
First
through
third
grade
is
a
blur
of
learning
to
read,
weekly
spelling
tests,
basic
mathematics
and
my
least
favorite
assignment,
phonics.
For
some
reason,
I
had
such
a
difficult
time
distinguishing
between
long
and
short
vowels.
I
could
never
remember
whether
a
straight
line
or
a
U
belonged
above
a
certain
letter.
Nevertheless,
I
graduated
from
the
third
grade
using
pencils
and
continued
on
to
fourth
grade
and
was
finally
allowed
to
use
pens.
I
think
it
was
in
the
fourth
grade
that
I
wrote
my
first
book
report
and
learned
how
to
write
a
first
and
final
draft.
The
task
was
simple.
First,
read
a
book.
Then
on
paper,
describe
the
characters
and
setting,
write
a
summary
and
rate
the
book
telling
why
or
why
not
it
should
be
recommended
to
a
friend.
The
rough
draft
was
to
be
done
in
pencil,
double-spaced
on
yellow
paper
(which
I
hated
using
because
it
always
tore
when
I
erased)
and
the
final
draft
was
to
be
written
in
cursive
writing,
using
blue
ink
and
on
white
lined
paper.
I
usually
had
no
problem
constructing
the
report
but
I
remember
always
trying
to
stretch
it
so
it
would
appear
longer
on
paper.
I
would
leave
one
inch
spaces
between
each
word
thinking
Ms.
Cohen
wouldn't
notice
and
would
simply
think
I
had
put
in
a
lot
of
effort
because
it
appeared
to
be
so
long.
Shortly
thereafter,
I
came
to
the
realization
that
what
matters
is
the
quality
of
the
work
on
the
paper,
not
the
quantity
of
paper
used
to
do
the
work.
In
the
fifth
grade
I
had
my
first
encounter
with
a
weekly
journal.
Each
Monday
morning
the
class
was
instructed
to
take
out
our
blue
books
and
write
for
fifteen
minutes
about
anything
that
came
to
our
minds.
It
always
seemed
at
that
moment
I
could
not
think
of
a
single
thing
to
write
about.
Everyone
around
me
would
scramble
to
cram
anything
and
everything
into
their
books
during
the
allotted
fifteen
minutes.
I
would
sit
at
my
desk
and
panic,
wondering
about
what
everyone
else
was
writing
and
what
I
should
write
about.
Eventually
I
would
describe
the
events
of
my
soccer
game
or
other
weekend
activities
to
fill
the
empty
space
of
my
book.
Then
by
the
end
of
the
week
Ms.
Fisch
would
return
the
journals
with
comments
to
our
responses.
I
always
looked
forward
to
reading
her
comments,
but
it
was
torture
to
have
to
write
the
entry.
I
think
journals
should
be
spontaneous
writing
and
you
shouldn't
have
to
feel
compelled
to
write.
When
the
entry
is
not
mandatory,
I
feel
able
to
explain
what
I
am
thinking,
feeling
or
whatever
instead
of
just
making
something
up
to
kill
time.
In
the
sixth
grade,
I
had
my
last
class
of
Language
Arts
with
Mrs.
Pileski.
In
the
following
years,
the
class
where
I
studied
literature
would
be
known
as
English.
I
was
glad
to
be
finished
with
Language
Arts
because
its
primary
focus
was
proper
grammar
usage.
Obviously
I
knew
that
this
was
important,
but
I
hated
being
tested
on
identification
of
correct
verb
tenses,
modifiers
and
direct
objects.
The
work
was
very
monotonous
and
I
preferred
to
write
in
response
to
specific
essay
questions
or
topics
rather
than
circling
the
indirect
object
in
a
sentence.
In
Mr.
Nelson's
class,
I
got
my
first
dose
of
lab
write-ups.
The
procedure
was
very
formal
and
extremely
dull.
Each
lab
consisted
of
five
components
that
were
to
be
arranged
in
a
specific
set-up.
The
lab
began
with
a
Hypothesis
which
usually
started
out
something
like
this:"
In
this
lab
we
studied
the
effects
of.....yadda
yadda
yadda"
This
was
followed
by
the
Procedure
where
we
discussed
the
steps
we
took
to
complete
the
experiment.
The
Data/Observation
section
followed
the
Procedure
and
revealed
our
specific
calculations
and
any
important
notes
we
had
made
during
the
experiment.
This
was
finally
followed
by
a
Conclusion
where
we
were
supposed
to
explain
whether
the
hypothesis
had
been
proved
or
disproved
and
the
reason
why.
The
last
section
was
called
Sources
of
Error.
In
this
section
we
were
supposed
to
indicate
if
there
was
any
time
during
the
experiment
when
something
went
wrong
which
would
yield
inaccurate
results.
This
was
the
set
up
each
teacher
required
from
seventh
grade
Earth
Science
until
my
senior
year
Physics
class.
Needless
to
say,
science
was
my
least
favorite
subject.
I
found
this
format
very
boring
and
routine.
After
a
while
I
just
started'going
through
the
motions*
when
I
was
doing
a
lab
write
up.
I
did
the
work
just
to
get
it
done
and
didn't
really
think
much
about
what
I
was
writing
because
lab
write-ups
are
very
systematic
and
uncreative.
The
Conclusion
is
the
only
section
where
it
would
be
appropriate
to
introduce
your
own
ideas
about
the
results
of
the
experiment;
but
even
so,
if
the
conclusions
are
incorrect,
the
teacher
will
take
points
off
the
final
grade.
Just
like
high
school
is
supposed
to
prepare
one
for
college,
middle
school
is
supposed
to
prepare
one
for
high
school.
And
just
like
the
situation
is
now
with
college
writing,
the
question
when
I
finished
middle
school
was
Do
you
feel
adequately
prepared
for
high
school
writing?
When
I
completed
eighth
grade
I
felt
very
confident
with
my
writing.
By
then,
I
knew
that
math
and
science
were
not
my
strongest
suits
and
that
I
tended
to
perform
better
in
classes
like
English,
Spanish
and
History.
When
I
registered
for
classes
as
a
freshman,
I
decided
to
enroll
in
all
Honors
courses.
In
my
high
school,
Honors
was
the
middle
of
the
road,
above
Standard
Level
but
below
Accelerated
classes.
I
had
a
solid
first
year
but
I
noticed
a
significant
increase
in
the
amount
of
reading
and
writing
required
for
English
and
History
classes.
Instead
of
multiple
choice
and
short
answer
tests
I
had
experienced
in
middle
school,
essay
tests
were
used
to
test
student's
knowledge
of
the
material.
However,
I
preferred
essay
tests
to
single
answer
tests
because
they
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
explain
my
own
ideas
when
answering
a
question.
Therefore,
as
long
as
the
essay
was
well
thought
out
and
coherent,
there
was
always
the
possibility
for
more
than
one
answer...unlike
science
and
math
class.
After
my
freshman
year
of
high
school
I
decided
to
step
up
to
the
next
level
and
take
Accelerated
English.
During
my
sophomore
year
I
noticed
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
writing
assignments
but
the
work
was
not
overwhelming.
When
I
started
my
junior
year
I
thought
I
belonged
in
the
Accelerated
level
but
soon
I
began
to
think
that
I
may
be
in
over
my
head.
We
were
constantly
writing
papers
about
anything
we
had
read
or
discussed
in
class.
I
felt
like
I
couldn't
keep
up
with
the
work
and
I
came
very
close
to
dropping
back
down
to
Honors.
I
think
junior
year
can
be
classified
as
the
Year
of
the
Breakdown.
I
can
remember
countless
nights
when
I
would
end
up
in
tears
because
I
just
wasn't
able
to
get
anything
down
on
paper.
I
had
writer's
block
at
its
worst!!
However,
I
finished
the
year
in
the
class
and
although
it
was
a
struggle,
I
learned
some
very
valuable
techniques.
First,
before
any
draft
was
turned
in,
it
had
to
be
read
by
a
classmate
and
evaluated.
Other
high
school
teachers
had
required
that
we
exchange
drafts
for
criticism
but
usually
we
just
ended
up
quickly
initialing
the
draft
and
rewriting
it
for
a
final
grade.
In
Mrs.
Fleming's
class
we
not
only
had
to
read
eachother's
papers
and
make
comments
but
we
had
to
write
them
down
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
turn
it
in
with
the
final
draft.
Sometimes
I
was
a
little
self
conscious
of
my
writing
because
I
felt
like
I
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
totem
pole
and
that
my
writing
could
never
compare
to
some
of
the
brilliant
writers
in
my
class.
Over
time,
however,
I
got
used
to
the
idea
of
having
someone
read
my
work
and
it
was
helpful
to
hear
what
they
liked
and
disliked
about
the
paper.
Another
thing
that
Mrs.
Fleming's
class
helped
me
learn
was
that
each
paper
should
have
a
certain
structure...thesis,
body,
conclusion.
This
is
fundamental
to
writing
and
Mrs.
Fleming
helped
drill
it
into
my
head.
Although
I
hated
having
to
do
constant
revisions,
it
was
worth
it
because
my
writing
improved
significantly
that
year.
Overall
I
had
a
good
experience
in
junior
English
but
I
decided
to
drop
back
and
not
take
AP
English
as
a
senior.
Instead
I
opted
for
Honors
and
it
was
a
joke.
I
think
I
probably
wrote
three
papers
all
year.
At
the
time
I
thought
it
was
fun
because
it
demanded
little
effort
but
towards
the
end
of
the
year
I
began
to
worry
about
the
effects
this
would
have
on
my
transition
to
college
writing.
Throughout
high
school
and
even
middle
school,
my
English
teachers
continually
reminded
us
that
each
assignment
we
completed
would
help
us
prepare
for
college
level
writing.
At
the
time,
the
term
college
level
sounded
scary
and
I
wondered
whether
I
would
ever
feel
prepared.
My
high
school
teachers
always
warned
us,"In
college,
the
professors
don't
have
time
for
rewrites.
When
you're
writing
a
paper,
you
only
get
one
shot."
Well,
maybe
this
is
true
for
a
large
university,
but
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
I
learned
in
my
First
Year
Seminar
that
revisions
would
be
a
major
part
of
the
writing
process.
During
that
semester
I
wrote
only
three
papers
but
I'm
sure
I
wrote
at
least
ten
drafts.
I
loved
this
aspect
of
my
FYS.
Revisions
were,
if
not
mandatory,
always
encouraged
by
our
professor
and
I
know
my
writing
improved
over
the
semester
because
of
it.
I
learned
to
push
myself
and
go
farther
with
my
ideas
rather
than
just
put
words
on
paper
so
I
could
turn
the
assignment
in
on
time.
In
that
respect,
Lafayette
challenged
my
original
perecption
of
college
writing
.
Literary
Questions
205
was
one
of
my
favorite
classes
this
year
for
the
same
reasons
I
enjoyed
FYS.
They
both
were
oriented
around
group
discussion
and
group
work
and
most
importantly,
both
professors
were
extremely
encouraging
of
students
to
revise
and
expand
our
ideas.
Nothing
was
ever
etched
in
stone
and
I
found
this
helpful
as
a
first
year
writer.
I've
come
a
long
way
from
Crayola
crayons
but
I'm
always
looking
for
suggestions
of
ways
to
improve
a
paper
or
my
writing
in
general.
