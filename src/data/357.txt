Mv
History
as
a
Writer:
A
Personal
Narrative
When
I
was
a
small
child,
two
things
motivated
my
love
of
writing:
the
storybooks
read
to
me
before
bedtime
and
my
penchant
for
drawing
with
crayons.
Using
stacks
of
computer
paper
my
father
brought
home
from
the
office,
I
wrote
my
own
tales
of
princesses,
dinosaurs,
dolls
that
came
to
life,
and
a
brother
and
sister
perhaps
not
so
coincidentally
named
"Christina"
and
"Andrew"
like
my
brother
and
me.
I
would
print
one
sentence
on
a
page
with
my
black
crayon
and
then
pause
to
illustrate
before
moving
onto
the
next.
The
next
page
began
when
I
was
happy
with
the
picture,
and
the
story
ended
when
it
was
time
to
clean
up
for
lunch.
These
innocent
"storybooks"--though
little
more
than
my
own
"make
believe"
fairytales,
were
my
first
attempts
at
establishing
myself
as
a
writer.
The
beginnings
of
writing
for
academic
purposes
began
in
the
first
grade.
Writing
only
when
prompted
to,
my
classmates
and
I
jotted
down
our
perceptions
of
what
was
going
on
in
an
illustration,
explained
what
we
did
in
class,
and
explored
what
we
might
want
to
be
when
we
"grew
up."
That
same
year,
I
received
a
present
from
my
aunt
and
uncle
that
I
had
not
expected:
a
tiny
pink
book
covered
in
hearts,
inscribed
with
a
single
word:
"Diary."
"What
do
you
use
this
for?"
I
asked
politely.
"You
write
down
whatever
you
like
in
it,"
said
my
grandmother.
"Every
day
has
a
space
for
you
to
write
what
you
did
that
day
so
you
don't
forget
later."
That
seemed
simple
enough
to
me.
On
the
days
that
I
remembered,
I
printed
as
neatly
as
I
could
in
my
diary
what
I
had
done
that
day,
always
beginning
entries
with:
"I
woke
up."
Simply
written
in
youthful
innocence,
they
lacked
feeling
or
emotion,
yet
they
captured
some
of
my
earliest
attempts
at
expressing
myself
on
paper.
As
I
progressed
from
elementary
school
through
middle
school,
my
teachers
introduced
the
formalities
of
writing
while
encouraging
creativity.
The
first
formal
writing
lesson
that
I
recall
focused
on
the
importance
brainstorming.
Our
teachers
taught
us
several
ways
of
mapping
out
ideas
so
that
when
given
free
time
to
write,
we
would
have
an
idea
of
where
to
begin.
Initially,
we
made
lists
of
possible
ideas
for
our
stories
or
narratives;
before
we
knew
it,
we
were
drawing
immense
webs
with
endless
details
branching
off
of
main
ideas.
As
my
ability
to
map
out
my
ideas
expanded,
so
did
my
ability
to
write
about
my
feelings
and
emotions.
The
entries
in
my
diaries
no
longer
began
with
the
first
event
of
the
day,
but
with
the
event
that
meant
the
most
to
me
that
I
needed
to
get
out
of
my
head
or
that
I
wanted
to
remember.
I
wrote
down
my
most
embarrassing
moments
and
my
happiest
moments
before
locking
up
the
little
book
with
a
tiny
silver
key
I
kept
in
my
pillowcase.
My
diary
had
become,
and
continues
to
be
my
secret
best
friend.
As
the
cup
of
my
imagination
filled
and
overflowed,
my
teachers
encouraged
my
classmates
and
me
to
expand
our
writing
portfolios.
We
began
supplementing
our
fictional
stories
and
personal
narratives
with
persuasive
essays
and
research
papers.
Identifying
effective
means
of
reaching
out
to
others
and
communicating
our
opinions,
we
practiced
by
writing
letters
to
non-existent
congressmen
trying
to
convince
them
to
vote
for
a
proposed
bill
or
by
imploring
troubled
imaginary
friends
to
change
their
ways.
We
also
began
checking
out
library
books
on
historical
events,
famous
people,
and
current
events
as
we
learned
to
explore
the
importance
or
significance
of
a
particular
topic
on
paper.
By
the
eighth
grade,
we
were
getting
our
first
lessons
in
"the
big
stuff':
thesis
statements,
topic
sentences,
and
formal
outlining.
Initially,
I
found
these
new
rules
very
frustrating
and
confining.
The
thesis
statement,
I
was
told,
should
touch
on
every
major
topic
to
be
covered
in
the
paper
and
should
give
the
reader
a
clear
idea
of
where
the
paper
was
headed.
In
addition,
I
needed
to
have
sentences
at
the
beginning
of
my
paragraphs
that
would
sum
up
the
paragraph
and
relate
back
to
the
original
thesis.
"In
a
good
paper,"
one
teacher
explained,
"I
should
be
able
to
read
your
thesis
and
your
topic
sentences
and
get
a
very
good
idea
of
what
this
paper
is
about."
Initially,
I
felt
dizzy;
I
couldn't
imagine
how
I
could
write
a
single
sentence
that
would
encompass
the
entire
scope
of
what
I
wanted
to
accomplish
in
a
paper.
Furthermore,
I
couldn't
fathom
how
I
could
create
sentences
that
would
both
state
clearly
the
main
issues
discussed
in
each
paragraph
and
relate
back
to
the
thesis!
I
had
brainstormed
in
the
past,
but
often
did
not
know
exactly
what
the
direction
of
my
paper
would
be
before
I
started
writing.
How
could
I
possibly
write
all
of
these
sentences
before
I
wrote
the
rest
of
the
body?
As
I
advanced
through
high
school,
I
worked
continuously
to
improve
my
ability
to
use
thesis
statements
and
topic
sentences
to
my
advantage.
I
began
by
trying
to
plan
or
outline
my
major
issues
and
goals
prior
writing
sentences
for
them.
It
didn't
take
my
long
to
discover,
however,
that
my
ideas
often
changed
and
expanded
as
I
wrote,
rendering
this
method
useless.
The
thesis
and
even
the
topic
sentences
I
drafted
prior
often-needed
drastic
revisions
before
they
could
come
close
to
fitting
the
paragraph
as
well
as
they
needed
to.
I
undoubtedly
needed
to
try
a
new
technique.
Out
of
that
first
attempt
at
designing
the
perfect
thesis
and
topic
sentences
for
my
paper
came
the
exact
opposite:
I
wrote
these
sentences
last,
after
I
had
gotten
my
ideas
down
on
paper.
I
stuck
with
this
method
for
years
because
I
loved
the
fact
that
I
was
now
able
to
get
ideas
down
before
I
worried
about
the
sentences
I
needed
to
fit
the
paragraphs.
These
sentences
still
captured
what
I
had
written
about,
but
without
confining
my
ideas.
I
stuck
with
this
method
through
high
school
until
my
junior
year
of
high
school,
when
I
was
enrolled
in
an
honors
expository
writing
class.
It
occurred
to
me
that
I
was
tired
of
being
told
that
my
papers
tended
to
be
"wordy."
I
was
faced
with
the
realization
that
the
thesis
statement
and
topic
sentences
play
a
huge
role
in
making
a
paper
strong
yet
concise.
A
handful
of
my
teachers
commented
that
while
my
ideas
were
well
developed,
my
sentences
were
filled
with
unneeded
words
and
phrases
that
took
away
from
my
papers'
overall
effectiveness.
The
reason?
I
wasn't
always
sure
where
I
was
going
when
I
started
my
paragraphs!
I
decided
that
I
needed
to
find
a
middle
ground:
I
had
to
spend
some
time
planning
my
paper
before
I
wrote
it
while
still
allowing
myself
the
freedom
to
modify
and
change
my
thesis
and
topic
sentences
as
I
wrote.
As
I
used
this
technique,
my
papers
began
to
flow
more
freely.
I
felt
like
I
had
a
sense
of
direction
sitting
down
to
write,
yet
I
was
no
longer
so
confined
by
pre-existing
plans
that
I
prevented
myself
from
modifying
my
original
plans
as
my
thoughts
took
shape.
This
method
has
continued
to
work
well
for
me
today.
I
always
identify
the
key
points
I
want
to
discuss,
but
I
also
find
myself
changing
my
topic
sentences
and
thesis
statement
as
I
feel
necessary.
As
a
result,
my
writing
has
become
clearer;
it
seems
to
flow
much
more
easily,
a
key
in
overall
effectiveness.
Thesis
statements
and
topic
sentences
were
not
my
only
target
when
I
began
addressing
the
weaknesses
in
my
writing.
Like
many
students,
I
was
told
that
I
needed
to
work
on
the
transitions
between
my
paragraphs.
How
did
you
get
from
there
to
here?
my
teacher
would
ask.
It
didn't
take
me
long
to
realize
that
what
seemed
like
an
easy
transition
to
me
was
not
always
an
easy
transition
for
a
reader.
In
the
past,
I'd
felt
that
if
a
teacher
couldn't
understand
why
my
paragraphs
were
next
to
each
other,
then
they
just
didn't
belong
together.
Out
of
the
blue,
I
discovered
that
their
complaint
simply
stemmed
from
my
neglecting
to
guide
the
reader
along
my
train
of
thought.
Having
realized
that
I
needed
to
more
clearly
bridge
my
ideas
to
keep
the
reader's
attention,
I
sat
down
and
reviewed
the
simplest,
most
efficient
methods
of
linking
two
paragraphs
in
a
sentence
or
two.
I
began
paragraphs
by
mentioning
something
in
the
previous
paragraph,
relating
back
to
my
original
thesis,
and/or
using
key
words
and
phrases
such
as
however
or
in
contrast
to
indicate
the
direction
in
which
I
intended
to
continue.
These
techniques
added
to
the
overall
flow
of
the
paper
and
also
tended
to
add
weight
to
my
arguments.
Another
component
of
my
writing
that
I
sought
to
improve
was
my
grammar.
After
middle
school
graduation,
I
found
that
most
English-based
courses
focused
on
literature
and
writing
skills.
The
topics
covered
in
composition,
however,
rarely,
if
ever,
touched
upon
the
mechanics
of
writing.
Having
done
well
in
grammar
classes
in
elementary
school
and
middle
school,
I
felt
comfortable
with
basic
grammar,
but
still
recognized
the
"gray
areas"
in
my
knowledge
base.
I
needed
a
review.
When
I
was
preparing
to
take
the
SAT
II
writing
exam,
I
bought
several
study
guides
covering
basic
elements
of
English
grammar.
I
realized
that
while
dozens
of
the
rules
had
become
instinct
to
me,
others
were
strange
and
unfamiliar.
While
it
was
frustrating
to
realize
this,
studying
grammar
for
a
writing-based
exam
forced
me
to
keep
in
mind
that
grammar
could
add
or
take
away
from
the
credibility
of
my
paper.
Junior
year
I
got
even
luckier,
although
I
didn't
realize
it
at
first.
I
arrived
at
my
expository
writing
course
to
find
that
our
teacher
planned
to
incorporate
basic
grammar
lessons
into
our
curriculum.
"Most
teachers
don't
spend
much
time
on
this,"
he
told
us.
"But
it's
important."
We
all
rolled
our
eyes
expecting
the
same
grammar
lessons
we'd
been
taught
over
and
over
again.
But
to
my
surprise,
we
didn't
study
commas
and
semicolons
as
I
had
feared,
nor
did
we
spend
time
discussing
the
difference
between
"they're,"
"there"
and
"their."
Instead,
we
focused
on
elements
of
our
language
that
could
assist
us
in
writing
better
papers.
We
talked
about
the
structure
of
different
sentences,
the
use
of
the
passive
voice,
and
so
on.
Though
I
always
found
the
lessons
tedious,
the
review
he
provided
was
well
worth
the
effort.
By
the
time
I
had
finished
the
class,
I
knew
I
could
use
grammar
to
my
advantage.
As
a
new
arrival
at
Lafayette
last
fall,
I
found
myself
nervous
but
largely
confident
that
I
would
be
able
to
handle
writing
at
the
college
level.
Looking
back
on
my
time
in
high
school,
I
realized
that
my
honors
and
advanced
placement
literature
and
composition
courses
taught
me
the
true
meaning
of
the
phrase
"learning
never
ends."
When
I
read
the
papers
I
wrote
four
years
ago,
I
could
see
that
my
skills
had
both
grown
and
expanded.
The
flow
of
my
writing
smoothed,
my
paragraphs
grew
more
concise,
and
my
personal
writing
style
continued
to
develop.
I
still
had
a
lot
to
learn
but
also
felt
that
my
experiences
in
high
school
provided
me
with
a
good
starting
point.
Overall,
my
expectations
were
confirmed.
My
professors
told
me
that
my
writing
was
very
well
developed
and
organized,
yet
they
continued
to
challenge
me
to
improve
my
writing
skills
and
style.
I
spent
hours
on
each
one
of
my
papers:
sifting
through
the
sentences
looking
for
unneeded
words
or
phrases,
clarifying
vague
ideas,
organizing
paragraphs,
and
modifying
my
thesis
and
topic
sentences.
I
begin
my
sophomore
year
at
Lafayette
with
a
hope
that
I
will
continue
in
my
ongoing
quest
to
become
a
great
writer.
It's
my
hope
that
in
being
a
writing
associate,
I'll
be
able
to
help
others
to
reach
their
full
potential
while
also
helping
myself
to
better
identify
weak
areas
in
my
own
writings
and
to
improve
my
skills.
I've
come
a
long
way,
but
for
me,
the
journey
has
only
begun.
