Writing
Pinball
The
literacy
journey
that
I
have
been
on
has
been
comparable
to
game
of
pinball.
The
whole
time
I
have
bounced
back
and
forth
between
compliments
and
disappointments.
The
journey
has
been
highlighted
by
many
struggles
and
painful
lessons
that
have
knocked
me
down,
but
in
the
overall
picture
have
pushed
me
to
be
where
I
am
now.
Where
am
I
now?
That
is
a
very
good
question.
I
believe
I
have
finally
reached
a
point
in
my
writing
career
where
I
have
just
scored
an
"extra
ball"
bonus.
The
journey
has
been
long
and
hard,
so
we
had
better
get
started
if
there's
any
hope
of
anyone
understanding
where
I've
come
from.
My
first
work
of
writing
came
in
either
kindergarten
or
first
grade,
when
we
were
concentrating
on
illustrating
one-sentence-a-page
narratives.
Everyone
in
the
class
was
asked
to
go
out
in
the
hall
with
the
teacher's
aid,
and
come
up
with
a
story,
which
the
aid
would
then
write
up
in
a
nice
little
book,
which
would
then
be
our
job
to
illustrate.
It
wasn't
much
of
a
writing
assignment,
but
I
do
remember
going
out
into
the
hall
when
my
name
was
called
and
rather
than
dictating
my
story
to
the
aid,
I
wrote
it
down.
My
story
was
about
our
summer
vacation,
when
we
had
gone
up
to
our
cottage
on
a
lake
in
the
Poconos.
The
main
thing
I
remember
from
that
was
not
being
able
to
spell
"cottage".
The
rest
of
the
assignment
did
not
go
quite
as
well,
for
my
art
skills
were
not
as
developed
as
they
are
today.
However,
the
teacher's
aid
was
impressed
that
I
had
written
out
the
story,
and
when
the
book
returned
from
being
laminated
in
the
library
there
were
some
good
compliments
written
on
the
back
page.
This
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
I
was
given
an
assignment,
thought
it
through,
and
then
generated
my
work
onto
paper
by
myself.
It
was
a
very
satisfying
moment
as
I
began
my
writing
career,
especially
since
some
of
my
classmates
couldn't
understand
what
the
teacher's
aid
had
written
in
their
stories,
making
a
rough
time
for
illustration.
The
only
major
feeling
I
remember
having
at
the
time
was
that
while
everyone
else
was
praising
me
for
having
written
the
story
on
my
own,
I
was
upset
because
my
drawings
looks
nothing
like
our
cottage.
Third
grade
marked
the
beginning
of
any
real
form
of
writing.
It
was
right
around
third
grade
that
I
was
becoming
an
avid
Hardy
Boys
and
Three
Investigators
reader.
This
was,
of
course,
reflected
in
my
writing.
I
was
beginning
my
mastery
of
the
use
of
dialogue.
My
stories
would
be
in
Franklin
W.
Dixon's
Hardy
Boy-style.
This
was
also
a
time
when
plot
began
to
actually
matter.
Our
assignments
always
included
brainstorming
ideas
using
a
web
diagram
to
try
to
relate
ideas
together
to
try
to
form
a
plot.
It
was
amazing
how
much
my
reading
influenced
my
writing.
I
actually
even
wrote
a
Three
Investigators
book.
At
the
time
we
were
studying
London,
England,
and
our
books
had
to
be
about
London.
Since
I
was
into
the
Three
Investigators
so
much,
I
made
London
the
setting
for
their
mystery.
It
was
this
sort
of
plot
work
that
helped
me
to
start
becoming
a
real
writer.
The
brainstorming
and
web
diagrams
were
always
composed
so
that
I
could
bring
different
ideas
together
in
creative
ways.
Third
grade
was
spent
developing
the
ideas
of
plot,
and
setting
and
the
basic
elements
of
writing
fictional
stories,
but
the
thing
that
stayed
with
me
more
than
anything
was
the
Hardy
Boys
style.
I
yearned
to
be
able
to
write
a
Hardy
Boy
just
like
the
ones
I
was
reading,
but
we
were
never
allowed
to
write
more
than
one
sentence
a
page
in
our
books,
and
the
length
of
a
Hardy
Boy,
and
complexity
of
the
plot
was
too
overwhelming
for
me.
However,
my
love
of
Hardy
Boys
would
remain,
as
well
as
my
writing
desires.
As
we
skip
ahead
to
seventh
grade,
my
writing
development
is
focusing
on
two
new
areas;
creative
writing,
and
research
papers.
In
English
class
we
began
focusing
on
new
types
of
writing.
No
longer
were
we
just
writing
stories
and
illustrating
them.
The
word
"essay"
was
becoming
painful,
as
we
were
given
topics
to
write
about
such
as
what
kind
of
impact
would
a
pill
that
eliminated
human's
need
for
sleep
have
on
the
human
race.
They
were
forcing
us
to
think
about
issues,
weighing
pros
and
cons
and
defending
our
viewpoints.
We
also
studied
different
types
of
poetry,
and
we
even
had
to
write
some.
The
point
when
we
arrived
at
poetry
was
equivalent
to
the
point
when
the
ball
rolls
right
between
the
two
flippers
and
you
lose
your
pinball.
Poetry
was
so
abstract
that
I
could
not
handle
it.
The
type
of
person
that
I
am,
still
keeps
me
from
being
able
to
appreciate
and
understand
poetry.
I
am
a
logical,
methodical,
clear,
concise
thinker,
and
when
words
began
taking
on
two
meanings,
and
we
are
forced
to
dig
around
for
a
deeper
meaning
my
brain
shorts
out.
Poetry
is
one
of
the
most
frustrating
forms
of
writing
I
have
ever
encountered.
I
can't
stand
that
the
person
next
to
me
might
find
a
completely
different
meaning
from
it
than
I
did,
and
it
hurts
even
more
to
find
out
that
the
poet
was
on
the
same
page
as
that
other
person
and
not
my
page.
In
seventh
grade
poetry
was
like
a
reminder
that
eventually
you
will
lose
that
pinball
game.
We
were
learning
that
form
didn't
always
matter,
there
wasn't
necessarily
a
"right"
way
to
write,
and
that
there
can
be
hidden
meanings.
We
learned
all
this
while
I
needed
to
know
the
correct
form
to
write
in,
the
right
way
to
form
an
essay,
and
a
logical
way
to
interpret
literature.
I
was
discouraged,
and
writing
began
to
become
boring
and
tedious
to
me.
Social
studies
in
seventh
grade
was
a
little
different
than
English
class.
We
were
writing
reports
using
a
three-point
format
on
topics
that
we
were
assigned.
Our
assignments
told
us
what
areas
of
research
we
should
concentrate
on,
and
gave
us
questions
to
answer.
Here
I
found
myself
in
a
situation
suited
much
better
for
me.
We
learned
how
to
write
our
essays
in
a
standard
five
paragraph,
three-point
format.
This
provided
me
with
a
form
that
I
could
duplicate
each
time
I
sat
down
to
write.
I
could
write
my
introduction,
first
point,
second
point,
third
point,
and
conclusion
in
five
nice
paragraphs
and
not
worry
that
I
had
missed
something
else.
These
essays
began
the
awful
use
of
the
"word
count"
tool.
Our
one
assignment
was
1,000
words.
That
was
an
incredible
length
for
a
kid
who
hadn't
written
anything
longer
than
500
words
before
in
his
life.
However,
1,000
words
wasn't
as
long
as
I
had
thought
and
soon
I
had
put
together
an
impressive
essay
that
made
me
feel
great
just
because
I
had
been
able
to
reach
the
1,000
words.
On
top
of
that,
I
was
using
analogies
in
my
essay
that
my
teacher
thought
were
really
good.
I
remember
comparing
something
in
Greek
mythology
to
the
relationship
between
natural
grass
and
Astroturf.
My
teacher
thought
it
was
a
perfect
analogy,
and
my
dad
was
happy
I
had
used
an
analogy
that
related
to
baseball.
This
type
of
writing
and
mostly
my
results
encouraged
me,
and
essays
never
seemed
to
scare
me,
because
I
had
always
seemed
to
be
successful
with
them.
However,
less
structured
writing
gave
me
many
headaches.
When
I
burst
upon
the
high
school
scene
I
had
the
most
writing
oriented
English
class
I
have
ever
had.
We
had
to
write
for
five
minutes
at
the
beginning
of
each
class
in
a
journal
about
whatever
word
the
teacher
decided
to
write
on
the
board.
This
sort
of
spur
of
the
moment,
stream
of
consciousness
writing
was
a
big
help
in
letting
my
writing
flow,
and
not
always
stopping
and
composing.
These
journals
were
full
of
unedited,
flawed
thoughts
that
often
times
didn't
even
make
sense.
But
they
taught
me
to
get
things
down
on
paper
without
worrying
how
they
sounded,
or
whether
or
not
it
was
the
best
way
to
say
what
I
meant.
This
set
up
an
extensive
revision
process.
We
also
had
to
write
an
essay
each
week
due
on
Friday.
On
top
of
that
we
had
to
write
three
twenty-page
research
papers
on
guided
topics.
All
of
our
long
lessons
of
grammar
were
also
now
being
thrown
into
our
own
writing.
Ninth
grade
was
not
really
about
quality
of
writing
although
it
was
needed
to
get
an
A,
but
it
was
more
about
quantity.
I
did
more
writing
that
year
than
I
did
the
rest
of
high
school,
and
even
in
college.
Of
course,
everyone
wanted
to
get
A's
in
ninth
grade,
but
it
was
very
satisfying
if
we
had
something
to
turn
in
for
each
assignment
no
matter
how
bad
it
was.
The
three
research
papers
taught
me
an
awful
lot
about
writing.
This
was
my
first
exposure
to
heavy
duty
research
papers.
Our
teacher
gave
us
a
category
of
topics
to
pick
from,
and
then
we
had
to
go
through
the
whole
process
of
doing
research
to
write
a
twenty
page
paper.
We
learned
about
the
process
of
picking
a
topic,
including
doing
preliminary
research
to
make
sure
our
topic
would
provide
enough
information
to
make
a
twenty
page
paper.
Thesis
statements
were
formed
so
that
our
papers
had
direction.
Then
we
took
trips
to
our
local
college
library
to
make
bibliography
cards
so
that
we
could
reference
our
sources.
Then
we
were
asked
to
do
our
actual
research
on
our
own.
When
we
gathered
our
sources
together
we
had
to
make
note
cards
for
each
different
aspect
of
our
topic
color
coding
them
by
source
so
that
we
could
eventually
document
them
in
our
drafts.
We
were
required
to
have
at
least
one
hundred
note
cards
for
each
paper.
Then
we
had
to
form
an
outline
of
our
selected
aspects
to
form
a
backbone
to
our
papers.
The
last
part
was
to
make
an
actual
draft.
The
draft
came
pretty
easily
in
terms
of
length,
since
we
had
everything
already
laid
out.
The
trick
was
that
our
draft,
as
well
as
every
step
along
the
way,
was
graded.
The
final
step
was
to
revise
the
draft
and
submit
our
final
copy.
Arriving
at
the
final
copy
was
tough,
because
we
were
expected
to
make
changes
from
our
draft
even
if
we
had
received
a
good
grade
on
the
draft.
This
process
extended
over
much
of
a
semester,
so
it
was
not
as
terribly
overwhelming
as
it
first
appeared.
The
emphasis
on
the
first
research
paper
was
mostly
on
the
procedure.
Our
teacher
graded
each
step
along
the
way,
and
held
strict
deadlines
for
each
step.
From
this
we
learned
that
by
doing
each
little
step,
the
actual
writing
of
the
paper
would
not
be
as
dreadful
as
we
always
thought.
This
approach
also
prevented
us
from
the
popular
write-the-paper-the-night-
before
technique.
The
real
beauty
to
this
course
was
when
the
second
research
paper
came
around.
This
time
we
were
not
so
guided
in
our
approach.
The
hope
was
that
we
would
use
what
we
had
learned
and
arrive
at
the
final
copy
the
same
way
as
the
first
paper,
but
this
time
by
ourselves.
I
remember
being
impressed
with
how
easy
the
first
paper
had
been
to
write
that
I
actually
did
the
same
process
on
the
second
paper.
However,
most
of
my
peers
did
not.
The
second
paper
taught
me
to
use
the
research
process
we
had
learned,
but
since
this
time
we
had
about
half
the
time
some
of
the
minor
steps
could
be
left
out.
By
the
third
paper,
which
we
had
three
weeks
to
write,
I
knew
exactly
what
I
had
to
do
to
be
able
to
write
a
good
research
paper
and
be
able
to
have
enough
worthy
information
to
make
it
twenty
pages.
The
next
wall
I
hit
in
my
pinball
game
of
writing
was
AP
English
my
senior
year
of
high
school.
This
turned
out
to
be
my
hardest
year
as
a
writer.
To
start
the
year
off,
I
found
out
that
I
missed
being
a
National
Merit
Finalist
from
the
PSAT
test
by
ten
points.
Based
on
my
scores,
those
ten
points
obviously
were
from
the
writing
part
that
I
had
blundered
quite
well.
Several
classmates
of
mine
were
National
Merit
Finalists,
all
of
whom
I
had
a
much
better
combined
score
excluding
writing.
With
this
upsetting
news,
I
began
AP
English.
My
teacher
was
the
sweetest
lady
I
have
ever
had,
and
I
really
liked
the
atmosphere
in
her
class.
However,
when
we
got
down
to
doing
actual
writing
I
felt
like
I
hit
a
brick
wall.
All
of
the
sudden,
I
found
that
I
could
not
interpret
literature
well
enough
to
write
good
papers.
This
was
a
point
in
my
academics
that
I
was
having
success
in
fields
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
from
writing.
It
was
clear
that
I
was
excelling
in
math,
physics,
and
chemistry,
and
English
was
falling
from
an
area
of
talent
for
me.
It
was
then
that
I
decided
I
was
really
going
to
work
hard,
and
figure
out
how
to
write
analysis.
I
spent
the
rest
of
the
year
trying
my
best
to
learn
how
to
write.
By
the
end
of
the
year
I
was
far
from
the
best
writer
in
the
class,
but
I
was
getting
grades
on
my
papers
that
satisfied
me.
Along
the
way
I
also
scored
below
average
on
the
Writing
section
of
the
SAT
IT
s.
By
the
time
the
AP
test
rolled
around
I
was
doing
much
better
at
analyzing
literature,
and
trying
to
understand
how
the
authors
were
making
their
points.
Inevitably,
I
got
a
three
on
the
AP
test,
and
had
to
take
English
in
college.
As
disappointed
as
I
was,
I
had
really
learned
a
lot
in
my
attempts
to
master
writing.
The
one
thing
I
really
grasped
from
that
year
was
that
everyone's
writing
style
is
different.
Around
the
time
of
graduation
I
remember
my
English
teacher
talking
about
myself,
and
two
of
my
best
friends.
She
described
my
friend
who
was
going
to
be
an
English
major
as
a
thorough
writer,
and
my
friend
who
was
going
into
premed
as
creative
and
flavorful,
and
she
described
me,
the
engineering
major,
as
a
clear,
logical
and
concise
writer.
She
knew
that
we
each
had
our
different
types
of
writing
styles,
but
each
one
was
fine
by
her.
However,
they
both
passed
the
test,
and
I
didn't,
but
I
was
happy
nevertheless.
In
anticipation
of
my
freshman
year
at
Lafayette
College,
I
was
very
concerned
about
my
writing
capabilities.
I
was
coming
off
of
a
year
in
which
I
had
received
many
setbacks,
so
I
was
very
concerned
about
"college
writing".
The
first
semester
started
off
with
my
FYS,
which
dealt
with
science
and
science
fiction.
This
was
a
great
help
to
me,
because
it
was
a
topic
that
I
enjoyed.
When
it
came
around
to
writing
our
papers,
I
made
a
concerted
effort
since
this
was
my
first
exposure
to
college
writing.
The
assignments
were
nothing
out
of
my
comfort
zone,
and
I
cranked
out
my
first
paper
pretty
easily.
Being
a
science
focused
seminar,
we
were
asked
to
look
into
science
topics,
so
we
had
to
do
research,
which
made
it
quite
easy
to
provide
quantity.
With
my
professor's
help,
I
was
able
to
provide
some
quality,
as
he
guided
me
in
areas
that
needed
more
development,
and
better
references.
My
grades
were
satisfying,
but
not
overly
exciting
to
me.
However,
for
some
reason
my
professor
liked
my
work,
and
apparently
my
grades
were
better
than
I
had
thought,
and
that
is
the
reason
that
I'm
writing
this
paper.
I've
always
tried
to
figure
out
how
to
write
on
my
own,
often
times
to
no
avail,
but
within
the
last
few
years
teachers
and
professors
have
tried
to
show
me
ways
that
I
can
become
a
better
writer.
That
is
why
I
wanted
to
become
a
writing
associate,
because
I
believe
that
writing
should
not
be
a
mystery,
but
a
working
process
with
lots
of
different
steps
along
the
way
to
help
one
grow.
Looking
back
at
my
writing
history,
it
certainly
has
been
up
and
down,
back
and
forth.
It
took
me
a
long
time
to
realize
that
writing
was
not
an
awful,
horrible
ordeal,
and
it
could
be
a
nice
logical
progression.
For
me,
it
just
took
some
time
to
find
out
what
the
right
progression
was.
Now
I
can
tell
when
I've
written
a
good
paper,
and
when
I've
written
something
just
to
get
it
over
with.
It
feels
like
my
writing
history
has
hit
every
square
inch
of
that
pinball
machine,
but
for
some
reason
I'm
sure
there
are
uncharted
waters
left
out
there.
