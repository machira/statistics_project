Writing
As
a
WA
When
I
visited
Lafayette
as
a
senior
in
high
school,
I
attended
a
presentation
given
by
writing
associates
to
describe
their
purpose
within
the
College
Writing
Program.
I
was
surprised
to
find
that
writing
associates
applied
to
multiple
subjects
and
disciplines,
not
just
the
common
English
classes
I
had
suspected
would
profit
from
such
a
program.
However,
at
the
time,
I
did
not
fully
realize
what
a
prominent
and
influential
role
writing
plays
in
every
field
of
study.
This
was
something
I
didnOt
fully
comprehend
until
the
second
semester
of
my
sophomore
year
at
Lafayette,
when
as
a
writing
associate,
I
was
assigned
to
a
computer
science
engineering
class
with
a
subject
matter
I
knew
nothing
about.
Yet
because
of
WA
training,
staff
meetings,
fellow
WAs,
and
the
professor
and
students
of
the
computer
science
class,
I
gained
a
greater
appreciation
for
the
importance
of
clear
and
understandable
writing
throughout
all
areas
of
interest.
I
quickly
learned
that
writing
is
the
means
through
which
people
are
able
to
convey
their
thoughts
and
arguments
to
others,
regardless
of
oneOs
intended
field
of
study.
Even
scientists,
who
tend
to
initially
disregard
writing
in
their
discipline,
need
to
be
able
to
express
themselves
and
their
ideas
clearly
through
their
writing
if
they
want
to
successfully
interact
within
their
academic
communities.
I
was
very
lucky
in
my
fall
class
assignment
last
year
when
I
worked
with
a
first
year
seminar
class
in
the
government
and
law
department.
The
professor
was
very
familiar
with
the
WA
program,
and
he
actually
contacted
me
to
set
up
a
schedule
for
the
class
before
we
even
returned
to
Lafayette.
He
provided
a
very
open
yet
serious
atmosphere
for
the
class
that
thrived
on
communication
and
accuracy,
which
was
very
helpful
during
my
first
semester
as
a
WA.
The
class
was
also
very
well
organized,
which
proved
to
be
invaluable
once
I,
and
the
students,
realized
that
for
each
writing
assignment
throughout
the
semester,
each
student
was
to
have
a
different
topic.
That
resulted
in
sixteen
different
subject
matters
for
each
paper,
providing
me
with
not
only
a
wide
variety
of
writing
styles
from
the
students,
but
a
vast
expanse
of
world
issues
as
well.
At
first,
I
was
worried
about
the
great
degree
of
differences
between
each
studentOs
subject
matter.
I
didnOt
know
how
I
was
going
to
be
able
to
help
the
students
reflect
on
their
writings,
while
fulfilling
the
requirements
of
the
professor,
when
I
couldnOt
even
find
a
common
ground
among
all
the
papers.
However,
after
about
four
or
five
conferences
with
the
students,
I
found
myself
giving
them
similar
advice
regarding
how
to
approach
their
topics.
I
then
realized
that
despite
their
wide
variety
of
detail,
the
issues
the
students
chose
to
write
about
all
related
to
common
themes
of
politics
discussed
in
their
seminar
class.
Right
in
the
middle
of
a
conference,
I
had
a
moment
of
understanding
about
the
papers
the
students
were
writing,
and
the
professorOs
purpose
of
the
papers
became
much
clearer.
As
I
continued
to
talk
with
this
particular
student,
I
mentioned
what
was
similar
between
his
paper
and
those
of
his
fellow
classmates.
As
a
result,
it
was
almost
as
if
he
too
suddenly
realized
how
the
themes
of
his
class
tied
together
all
the
different
paper
topics
of
the
individual
students.
As
a
result
of
our
conferences,
everyone
was
able
to
benefit
from
the
conclusions
drawn
from
each
separate
meeting
in
a
way
that
otherwise
might
not
have
been
discovered.
Despite
the
many
positive
aspects
of
my
FYS
class,
there
were
a
few
obstacles
throughout
the
semester.
While
the
professor
was
very
well
organized,
he
sometimes
had
such
preconceived
notions
regarding
how
he
wanted
papers
written
that
he
did
not
clearly
express
his
views
to
the
class.
He
often
assumed
that
the
students
knew
what
he
meant
without
going
into
further
detail,
which
was
not
usually
the
case
(especially
given
the
fact
that
the
students
were
in
the
first
semester
of
their
freshmen
year
and
not
entirely
used
to
the
format
of
college
classes).
During
my
first
round
of
conferences,
I
quickly
realized
that
there
were
many
questions
left
unanswered
by
the
professor
that
could
help
the
students
learn
to
adjust
their
writing
skills
to
what
the
professor
was
looking
for.
Luckily,
the
professor
was
very
easy
to
contact
and
approach,
so
I
was
able
to
compile
a
detailed
list
of
criteria
for
the
paper.
Because
of
these
early
incidents
of
confusion,
I
learned
to
ask
for
a
clear
set
of
guidelines
for
each
assignment,
and
I
knew
what
questions
to
ask
the
professor
before
beginning
my
conferences.
One
of
my
most
rewarding
experiences
as
a
WA
was
watching
a
particular
studentOs
writing
evolve
from
a
level
where
he
was
uncomfortable
with
writing
to
a
point
where
he
was
so
proud
of
his
own
work
that
he
had
a
new
confidence
for
not
only
his
writing
in
the
FYS,
but
also
in
his
other
classes.
During
our
first
conference,
he
explained
to
me
that
he
was
the
only
one
out
of
his
friends
from
high
school
who
had
gone
to
college
instead
of
staying
at
home
and
finding
a
job,
or
doing
nothing
at
all.
He
was
determined
to
continue
with
his
education,
but
once
he
arrived
at
Lafayette,
he
worried
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
keep
up
with
the
demanding
workload
and
strong
competition
from
other
students.
What
impressed
me
the
most
during
our
initial
meeting
was
his
eagerness
to
thoroughly
discuss
areas
of
his
paper
until
he
felt
he
had
a
stronger
grasp
on
what
he
was
trying
to
say,
instead
of
the
common
shyness
I
had
found
in
many
of
the
other
students.
As
the
semester
progressed,
this
particular
student
often
sent
me
multiple
revisions
of
his
papers
even
after
our
meetings,
and
we
always
discussed
the
comments
the
professor
provided
on
the
work
he
returned.
The
student
knew
the
class
was
demanding,
and
often
expressed
feelings
of
frustration
regarding
the
unusually
heavy
workload
of
his
own
class
compared
to
that
of
other
FYS
courses.
However,
at
the
end
of
the
semester,
I
met
with
the
student
to
discuss
his
growth
as
a
writer
over
the
course
of
the
term.
He
was
proud
of
himself
for
surviving
his
first
challenging
semester
of
college,
and
it
was
nice
to
know
that
even
in
some
small
way,
I
was
able
to
help
him
achieve
his
goal.
I
loved
working
with
this
particular
FYS
class
as
my
first
WA
assignment
because
I
felt
like
a
definite
link
between
the
students
and
the
professor.
Not
only
was
I
able
to
help
them
with
their
writing,
but
due
to
the
reoccurring
confusion
between
the
professorOs
expectations
and
what
he
explained
in
class,
I
was
able
to
encourage
the
students
to
schedule
private
meetings
with
their
professor
and
speak
up
when
they
did
not
understand
what
he
was
asking
of
the
class.
I
also
loved
being
able
to
see
the
growth
in
many
of
the
studentsO
writing.
Each
round
of
conferences
became
more
and
more
intricate,
and
with
many
students,
I
was
able
to
progress
in
what
we
discussed
during
our
meetings.
Many
students
became
aware
of
common
mistakes
that
they
fell
into
while
writing
and
were
able
to
recognize
these
patterns
on
their
own.
In
turn,
I
found
myself
becoming
more
critical
of
my
own
writing.
I
began
to
pay
more
attention
to
the
focus
and
central
purpose
of
my
papers,
while
at
the
same
time
looking
for
areas
of
difficulty
that
I
had
discussed
with
the
students
in
my
WA
class.
It
wasnOt
until
my
second
semester
as
a
WA
that
I
surprised
myself
and
realized
that
while
reading
my
own
paper
for
a
class,
I
was
reading
it
as
if
I
was
reading
one
of
my
studentOs
papers.
I
was
able
to
detach
myself
from
my
own
writing,
and
it
was
amazing
how
many
errors
I
found.
I
also
recognized
how
many
passages
were
clear
to
myself,
the
writer,
but
might
not
be
easily
understood
by
others
reading
my
work.
By
reading
my
paper
out
loud
(something
I
always
advised
my
students
to
do
as
well),
I
was
able
to
catch
awkward
phrasing,
spelling
errors,
and
organizational
errors.
It
was
as
if
by
opening
my
mind
to
other
studentsO
writing,
I
heightened
my
awareness
of
my
own
writing
as
well.
My
spring
semester
was
also
interesting
because
while
being
a
WA,
my
VAST
class
also
had
a
WA
assigned
to
it.
I
loved
my
meetings
with
my
WA,
because
there
was
an
additional
sense
of
openness
and
free
communication
available
to
us
since
we
both
had
gone
through
the
same
training
and
staff
meetings
to
know
how
to
formulate
a
successful
conference.
We
were
able
to
discuss
things
with
a
certain
level
of
clarity
and
comfortableness
from
the
very
beginning.
Also,
as
the
student,
I
wasnOt
afraid
to
ask
questions
about
my
writing
D
which
differed
from
some
of
my
first
conferences
with
freshmen,
since
there
seemed
to
be
an
inevitable
sense
of
shyness
that
came
from
our
age
difference
and
college
experience.
For
my
second
semester
as
a
WA,
I
was
assigned
to
a
computer
science
class,
which
not
only
consisted
of
a
subject
that
was
completely
foreign
to
me,
but
also
contained
students
who
continuously
missed
meetings.
However,
there
were
two
or
three
students
who
were
extremely
appreciative
of
our
conferences,
and
they
took
advantage
of
the
resources
available
to
them.
Despite
the
additional
obstacles
of
the
class,
I
learned
a
great
deal
from
the
experience.
In
terms
of
writing
techniques,
the
papers
were
often
difficult
to
read
because
of
the
excessive
amount
of
detailed
and
specific
terminology
that
applied
only
to
the
scientific
matters
at
hand.
Because
of
this,
I
often
asked
the
students
to
explain
themselves
out
loud
during
our
conferences.
As
they
were
speaking
with
words
and
phrases
that
were
not
in
their
papers,
they
realized
that
there
were
other
ways
to
organize
what
they
were
trying
to
say
while
providing
more
clarity
to
the
passage.
This
coincided
with
my
advice
to
students
to
also
read
their
papers
out
loud
or
have
someone
else
read
them
to
them,
allowing
them
to
hear
a
different
version
of
what
they
are
trying
to
say.
There
are
many
techniques
and
lesssons
I
learned
from
all
aspects
of
being
a
WA.
The
subjects
explored
during
staff
meetings,
such
as
our
continued
discussion
of
the
student
writer
as
a
novice
or
an
expert,
carried
over
into
multiple
areas
of
discussion,
and
are
constantly
applicable
to
situations
WAs
find
themselves
in.
It
is
also
extremely
beneficial
for
me
to
hear
the
experiences
of
other
WAs,
because
it
is
nice
to
know
if
someone
else
is
encontering
the
same
situations
I
am
with
my
class.
It
is
also
comforting
to
know
that
if
issues
arise
with
our
classes,
we
have
many
other
WAs
to
turn
to
as
sources
of
advice
and
support.
When
speaking
with
new
WAs,
I
hope
to
advise
them
to
take
advantage
of
all
that
is
available
to
them.
For
example,
drop-in
hours
are
a
great
time
to
keep
your
WA
skills
sharp,
without
having
the
familiarity
of
reading
a
paper
from
a
student
you
have
worked
with
all
semester.
Drop-in
hours
keep
WAs
on
their
toes
and
force
us
to
not
become
too
accustomed
to
only
working
with
a
certain
set
of
students.
Drop-in
conferences
also
further
prove
that
the
specific
subject
context
of
a
paper
does
not
need
to
be
known
in
order
for
a
paper
to
clearly
convey
ideas
or
arguments.
I
would
also
advise
WAs
to
encourage
their
students
to
take
notes
of
things
discussed
during
their
meetings.
Students
often
come
up
with
so
many
creative
and
solid
ideas
during
conferences
when
they
are
focused
on
their
papers,
yet
they
might
forget
everything
by
the
time
they
return
to
work
on
the
paper.
By
having
the
students
themselves
write
down
what
is
discussed
during
the
conference
or
take
notes
on
what
they
want
to
work
on,
they
are
using
their
own
words
to
revise
their
papers.
My
first
year
as
a
WA
provided
me
with
a
wide
variety
of
experiences
that
have
greatly
contributed
to
both
my
own
writing
skills
and
how
I
can
hopefully
help
the
writing
of
others.
I
cannot
wait
to
work
with
a
new
group
of
students
this
upcoming
year,
both
as
my
fellow
WAs
and
students
in
the
classes.
