Senior
Writing
Associate
Reflective
Essay
Reflections
of
a
Lafayette
Senior
My
name
is
and
I
am
a
senior
Writing
Associate
for
Lafayette's
Comprehensive
Writing
Program.
I
have
been
involved
with
the
program
for
one
year,
as
an
active
WA
in
fall
'96,
and
an
inactive
member
abroad
in
London,
England
spring
'97.
In
fall
'96,1
was
a
WA
for
Prof.
Seetch's
FYS
Why
Poetry
Matters?,
and
now
as
a
senior,
this
fall
'97
I
have
a
second
opportunity
to
be
an
active
Writing
Associate
for
Prof.
Ahl's
Italian
Renaissance
art
class.
As
an
aspiring
writer
who
focuses
on
the
human
experience,
I
have
had
the
ability
this
past
year
to
observe
present
student
behavior
and
present
and
past
human
behavior,
in
the
United
States
and
in
Europe.
As
a
Lafayette
WA
exposed
to
multiple
student
ideas
on
writing,
I
was
able
to
fit
my
styles
and
techniques
into
the
bigger
picture,
to
focus
on
writing's
universality
instead
of
stressing
about
my
own
writing
dilemma.
In
Great
Britain
and
Europe,
I
was
able
to
expose
myself
to
new
cultures,
countries,
lives,
and
people
which
added
to
my
wealth
of
experience
and
human
knowledge.
Reflecting
on
the
past
year,
a
division
already
hinted
at
above
between
the
fall
at
Lafayette
and
the
spring
in
London
sticks
out.
As
an
active
WA
I
focused
on
how
to
write,
and
abroad
my
focus
shifted
to
what
I
could
write.
What
is
a
Writing
Associate?
Put
most
simply,
a
writing
associate
is
a
member
of
Lafayette's
Comprehensive
Writing
Program
who
schedules
twenty
minute
one-to-one
conferences
with
fourteen
to
twenty
students
at
least
three
times
a
semester
to
revise,
advise,
and
edit
student
writing.
In
helping
to
improve
student
writing,
the
head
Professor
of
the
WA
Program
holds
weekly
staff
meetings
to
discuss
issues
involved
in
the
writing
and
WA
process.
WA's
are
responsible
for
attending
these
meetings
and
for
scheduling
monthly
"drop-in"
hours.
As
an
experienced
WA,
I
believe
that
the
above
definition
succinctly
recites
the
requirements
and
responsibilities
of
being
a
WA.
However,
I
also
believe
that
my
personal
experience
can
shed
light
on
the
resume
definition.
Spring
semester
sophomore
year,
I
decided
to
apply
to
the
Comprehensive
Writing
Program
to
place
myself
in
the
realm
of
the
educated.
The
VAST
class
I
was
taking
at
the
time
required
a
total
of
twenty
pages
written
by
May:
twenty
pages
on
any
topic,
any
format,
any
style.
My
professor
had
inherited
the
great
American
principle
of
freedom
of
choice
and
willingly
passed
it
on
to
our
class.
Great.
At
first,
I
was
excited
by
the
countless
possibilities
running
through
my
mind.
However,
I
became
increasingly
weary
as
the
ideas
kept
galloping
and
sprinting
around
and
around
without
a
direction.
It
was
the
VAST's
WA
who
threw
the
lasso
which
helped
me
tie
one
idea
down
to
ride
it
to
a
finished
thought
and
a
completed
paper.
The
lasso
he
threw
included
five
strings
tied
together:
a
thesis,
organization
and
structure
(paper,
paragraphs,
&
sentences),
verb
tenses,
punctuation
and
grammar,
and
MLA
Documentation.
He
showed
me
how
to
grab
hold
of
the
beginning
of
the
rope,
a
thesis,
known
as
a
problem
or
question
I
wanted
to
solve.
Then,
the
second
and
longest
part
of
the
lasso
he
explained
as
the
gathering
of
information
and
ideas
to
support
my
position.
After
I
got
all
my
ideas
on
paper,
then
I
reached
the
loop
of
the
rope
which
would
lasso
down
the
finished
idea
and
paper.
This
loop
included
all
forms
of
revision--
organization
and
structure,
verb
tense,
punctuation,
grammar,
and
MLA
documentation--
and
was
the
hardest
part
to
accomplish
entirely
correct.
The
WA
told
me
that
he
was
still
trying
to
get
the
last
part,
the
successful
lasso-ing
of
thought
and
paper,
down
pat.
His
suggestions
helped
me
realize
that
I
only
possessed
a
minute
knowledge
of
what
the
writing
process
entailed.
He
seemed
to
break
writing
down
to
some
form
of
science
and
helped
me
look
at
my
writing
in
a
practical
and
clear
manner.
As
a
result,
my
interest
in
the
writing
and
WA
process
grew,
caused
me
to
apply
to
the
program
to
help
clarify
personal
ideas
into
the
universal
process.
I
became
a
WA
after
completing
a
first-year
seminar,
first-year
writing,
Literary
Questions,
a
VAST
class,
other
required
English
and
Art
History
courses,
in
the
fall
of
my
junior
year.
As
a
double
English/
Art
major,
I
had
already
accomplished
my
share
of
writing
and
hoped
not
only
to
share
what
I
had
learned,
but
to
learn
what
my
students
shared.
My
experience
proved
to
be
beneficial
and
educational.
Not
only
was
I
able
to
communicate
with
eighteen
individual
students
about
writing,
I
was
also
able
to
see
the
writing's
universality
and
destroy
personal
fears
and
anxieties
about
my
own
writing
process.
My
FYS
students
came
to
their
conferences
most
likely
how
they
attended
class:
a
few
forgot
and
either
came
late
or
had
to
be
reminded,
a
handful
came
attentive
and
prepared,
and
a
select
few
came
prepared
with
reference
material,
armed
for
attack
with
specific
questions
to
probe
my
mind.
The
professor-ran
training
session
of
the
Comprehensive
Writing
Program
did
its
best
to
guide
me
in
these
conferences,
but
I
found
the
best
way
to
learn
was
through
the
experience
itself.
Each
student
who
attended
the
conferences
had
her/his
own
history
as
a
writer.
As
freshmen
at
Lafayette
College,
my
students
had
the
stress
of
being
away
from
home
the
first
time
adding
to
their
unawareness
of
the
writing
process
as
a
writing
process.
They
first
needed
to
be
broken
into
the
Program
on
a
psychological
level,
and
then
an
intellectual
level.
Most
students
eased
into
this
transition,
as
I
eased
into
learning
how
to
deal
with
each
one.
However,
more
than
less
students
spent
extra
time
with
me,
an
upperclassmen
who
had
had
the
freshmen
experience,
wanting
to
pick
my
brain
for
advice
not
just
about
their
papers,
but
about
the
college
life.
These
conferences
benefit
students
because
they
are
twenty
minutes
of
one-on-one
communication
focusing
on
writing,
and
any
topic
concerning
the
student.
To
handle
these
conferences
successfully,
a
Writing
Associate
must
respond
to
her/his
students
on
an
emotional
and
intellectual
level.
A
WA
must
understand
the
history
of
a
writer
by
asking
a
few
broad
questions
such
as,
"How
did
you
like
the
assignment?",
"How
do
you
think
your
paper
is?"
Through
continuous
meetings,
the
WA
to
student
relationship
should
become
an
active
dialogue
of
question
upon
question
to
help
the
writer
come
to
conclusions
about
her/his
own
paper
and
writing.
The
above
idealistic
version
of
"how
a
WA
should
approach"
a
meeting
does
not
always
work
out.
As
a
WA,
I
have
been
frustrated
with
a
student
who
refused,
possibly
because
he
did
not
know
how,
to
expand
his
analysis
of
the
life/death
cycle
in
Robert
Frost's
poem
"Nothing
Gold
Can
Stay."
I
have
also
been
frustrated
by
a
student
I
could
not
help
because
I
kept
pushing
my
ideas
onto
him,
without
trying
a
different
approach.
As
a
WA,
I
learned
to
search
for
different
and
alternative
options
to
help
get
my
point
or
the
student's
point
across.
The
unlimited
knowledge
my
brain
holds
locked
up
seemed
to
poured
forth
in
the
twenty
minute
conferences.
Seventy-two
conferences
in
one
semester
drained
me
mentally
and
emotionally.
I
felt
that
I
gave
my
students
everything
I
could.
My
experience
proved
the
saying,
you
get
out
of
it
what
you
put
into
it.
From
my
efforts,
I
received
the
ability
to
understand
multiple
viewpoints
writers
voice
in
papers
and
the
ability
to
distinguish
between
workable
and
poor
techniques.
I
was
able
to
ignore
personal
hang-ups
which
prevented
my
writing
process
to
expand
because
I
realized
they
were
not
individual
problems,
but
universal.
Knowing
that
many
students
shared
my
problems
with
active
and
passive
verbs,
establishing
theses,
structuring
papers,
and
organizing
ideas
helped
me
take
a
deep
breath
and
focus
on
my
writing.
As
a
result,
I
learned
how
to
write
and
think
simultaneously
and
successfully
to
produce
an
American
Renaissance
paper
on
the
heroines
in
Hawthorne's
The
Scarlet
Letter
and
Fanny
Fern's
Ruth
Hall:
one
of
my
best
papers
at
Lafayette.
The
WA
for
my
American
Renaissance
class
helped
me
increase
the
level
of
my
paper.
As
a
senior
WA
and
English
major,
my
WA
possessed
the
similar
background
of
what
goes
on
in
a
conference
from
the
WA's
perspective,
and
what
teacher's
expect
out
of
an
English
paper.
Together,
we
were
able
to
by-pass
the
universal
problems
with
writing
and
focus
on
the
argument
imbedded
within
my
paper.
These
conferences
between
two
English
majors
who
were
both
WA's
proved
to
discuss
advanced
issues
of
writing.
Unfortunately,
my
semester
as
an
inactive
WA
has
damaged
the
level
to
which
my
writing
had
risen.
Abroad,
I
did
not
focus
on
writing.
I
had
class
assignments
to
write
papers
and
journals,
but
I
did
not
spend
much
time
on
revising
and
editing.
As
a
writer,
I
wrote
from
the
first-hand
experience
of
what
I
was
witnessing
and
seeing.
This
idea,
which
was
a
new
way
of
thinking
for
me,
was
reinforced
by
the
newness
surrounding
me.
While
in
London,
I
lived
in
a
flat
with
seven
other
strangers,
had
an
internship
with
the
Royal
Opera
House,
and
traveled
within
England
and
on
the
European
continent
to
Paris,
Amsterdam,
cities
in
Italy,
Barcelona,
Salzburg,
Vienna,
and
Budapest.
Everything
was
new
around
me,
and
I
could
not
absorb
it
all
and
write
it
down.
As
a
result,
my
personal
journal
became
a
list
of
fragmented,
disjointed
phrases,
thoughts,
ideas,
sentences,
and
experiences.
My
actual
writing
process
came
to
a
halt,
but
my
wealth
of
knowledge
and
experience
upon
which
I
could
draw
to
write
about
increased
tenfold.
Although
I
had
an
unbelievable,
eye-opening
experience
abroad,
my
writing
suffered.
It
suffered
to
the
extent
that
this
summer,
when
I
began
this
assignment,
I
had
a
writer's
heart
attack
called
writer's
block.
Asking
me
to
reflect
on
my
past
year
as
a
writer
was
asking
me
to
reflect
on
everything
I
had
experienced
in
the
past
year.
Being
back
at
Lafayette
as
an
active
WA
and
attending
classes
with
regular
writing
and
papers
due,
I
have
only
recently
begun
to
recover
from
this
summer's
writer's
block.
Idea
by
idea,
paper
by
paper,
the
words
are
starting
to
flow.
In
fact
this
essay
has
helped
me
rediscover
what
I
had
started
to
find
at
the
end
of
fall
'97:
my
own
personal
lasso.
