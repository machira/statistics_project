Literacy
Narrative
My
first
writing
experience
that
I
clearly
remember
was
in
Beehive,
the
name
given
to
my
school's
preschool,
when
I
scribbled
a
short
story
about
a
horse
named
Beauty.
The
title
of
the
book
was
simply,
Beauty,
and
had
a
colorful,
four
legged
animal
bound
to
the
cover
which
stood
for
the
magical
beast.
Although
this
childhood
book
typifies
many
American
little
girl
fetishes
about
horses,
it
was
unique
and
more
significantly
it
was
well
received
by
my
elders.
I
wrote
the
book
at
home,
which
soon
developed
into
a
pattern
and
hobby
for
me.
The
positive
feedback
that
I
received
from
my
teachers,
mom,
and
big
brother
was
fortunate
for
it
encouraged
me
to
continue
for
the
sure
pleasures
of
creating,
expressing
and
writing.
Through
out
grade
school
Beauty
was
followed
by
The
Wish,
and
many
other
fables
too
numerous
to
all
be
remembered.
I
enjoyed
these
times
of
solitude
and
inspiration,
when
I
could
take
a
blank
sheet
and
any
writing
utensil
available
to
make,
create,
build
my
ideas
on
paper.
Along
with
the
short
stories
that
I
wrote
in
younger
years,
I
gradually
expanded
my
writing
to
include
diaries,
observation
journals
of
my
family
and
my
moods,
travel
logs,
want
to
do
lists
which
ballooned
beyond
many
short
stories,
short
term/long
term
future
goal
lists,
and
pen
pal
letters.
Since
Beehive
I
have
been
compassionately
and
continuously
writing.
The
process
alone
excites
me,
and
I
have
made
an
effort
to
regard
my
style
and
writing
processes.
In
the
beginning
of
my
writing
career
the
criteria
for
writing
was
more
broad
and
required
less
preparation.
Where
as
today,
I
know
that
there
are
always
certain
habits,
or
writing
rituals,
that
I
must
preform
in
order
to
be
able
to
write
successfully,
much
less,
write
at
all.
For
example,
I
know
that
prefer
to
write
with
cheap
Bic
ball
point
pens.
I
need
blue
ink,
for
black
intimidates
me
and
is
a
symbol
of
something
concrete,
and
unchangeable.
Something
that
I
know
my
writings
not.
I
enjoy
pencils,
or
I
should
express
that
it
is
more
the
old
fashioned
work
ethic
that
goes
into
pencil
sharpening,
yet
they
are
so
slow
on
paper.
Until
I
studied
in
Paris
my
sophomore
year,
I
was
religious
about
Eraser
Mate
brand
pens.
At
first,
I
went
to
great
lengths,
both
by
metro
and
economically,
to
purchase
these
rare
American
pens
in
Paris.
I
thought
they
were
wonderful
for
to
me
they
were
the
best
of
both
worlds,
a
quick
pen
yet
smooth
pencil
eraser.
The
French
taught
me
otherwise.
I
was
criticized
to
humiliation
for
using
such
a
messy,
unaesthetic,
bizarre
hybrid
of
a
STYLO!
It
was
clearly
unacceptable
and
understood
that
I
would
find
a
new
method
at
once.
Although
I
did,
and
am
grateful
for
the
lesson,
I
am
not
sure
that
my
Bics
are
much
higher
up
on
the
French
Scale
for
stylos.
Unlike
in
France,
in
the
United
States
papers
are
written
using
computers,
and
there
is
little
compromising
with
professors.
This
was
another
adaptation
to
my
writing
style
that
began
in
high
school.
When
I
could
I
cheated.
I
wrote
the
paper
out
by
hand
then
I
typed
it
up
fresh
and
clean,
thinking
that
I
had
beaten
the
system.
In
fact,
I
had
not.
I
had
lengthen
and
slowed
down
the
process.
I
had
damaged
and
unfinished
the
process,
but
I
had
not
beaten
it.
In
college
I
learned
to
brain
storm
on
the
computer,
write
and
easily
rewrite
and
redraft
,and
add
and
dramatically
change
my
papers
so
that
they
ended
up
looking
like
vague
siblings
of
the
papers
I
turned
in.
This
became
my
new
definition
of
writing.
Although
I
would
not
chose
to
write
poetry,
a
letter
to
Mom,
or
my
journal
on
the
computer
I
am
admirable
of
those,
like
Doogie
Howser
M.D.,
who
do
document
their
emotions
on
floppy
disks.
Yet
in
the
passion
of
inspiration,
I
still
grab
the
Bic
first.
My
hardest
challenges
in
writing
have
been
in
French.
My
essays
often
tend
to
take
on
battles
of
conflict
between
my
mother
tongue
and
the
foreign
language.
Partly
this
is
due
to
my
limited
vocabulary,
but
a
greater
reason
is
that
one
can
not
write
beautiful
French
if
they
are
thinking
in
English.
So
I
mentally
prepare
myself
for
each
writing
piece,
on
say
Baudelaire's
Les
Fleures
du
Mal,
by
listening
to
French
music
all
weekend,
maybe
calling
a
French
friend,
or
going
to
a
museum
(a
habit
of
Paris
habitation).
I
try
to
trick
my
mind
into
thinking
that
I
am
still
in
France.
If
I
can
associate
enough
memories
to
make
me
feel
more
French,
then
my
mental
barrier
comes
down
and
I
will
no
longer
by
trying
to
translate
English
into
French.
This
has
been
my
greatest
disability,
and
at
times,
advantage
in
writing.
Individualism
developed
gradually
in
my
writing
and
wasn't
fine
tuned
or
even
realized
until
I
got
to
college.
The
professors
at
Lafayette
asked
me
to
look
at
how
I
write,
and
maybe
why
I
write,
but
to
be
very
conscious
of
where
and
when
I
feel
comfortable
writing.
This
exercise
asked
me
to
individualize
my
style
and
form,
and
see
that
indeed
it
was
unique.
Therefore
I
should
respect
it
and
honor
my
edge.
What
I
mean
by
to
honor
one's
edge,
is
to
realize
when
you
are
getting
into
a
personal
danger
zone
and
get
yourself
out
of
it.
For
me
this
could
mean
leaving
the
library
within
the
first
ten
minutes,
if
I
am
too
distracted.
Or
it
could
also
mean
going
for
a
jog
before
hitting
the
computer
in
order
to
brain
storm
and
unwind.
Being
aware
that
I
need
these
circumstances
in
order
to
write
is
enormously
helpful.
Lafayette
has
made
me
realize
that
I
am
a
writer
and
that
writing
is
a
personal,
and
chosen
emotional
path
for
me.
In
high
school
I
felt
that
my
writing
was
seriously
challenged
and
criticized
in
my
teachers
attempt
to
demolish
what
ever
prior
notion
I
had
about
how
to
write
a
paper.
They
wanted
to
revolutionize
the
three
paragraph
essay,
kill
the
to
conclude
statements,
while
keeping
original
thesis.
My
history
papers,
along
with
those
of
my
sparse
classmates,
were
returned
covered
in
red,
and
barring
codes
such
as
IRRELEVANT,
INSIGNIFICANT,
POINTLESS,
and
CRAP!
K.I.S.S
(Keep
It
Short
And
Simple)
had
new
meaning
to
us
as
freshman,
and
key
board
cramps
soon
became
second
nature.
I
was
drilled,
grilled
and
pounded
to
learn
how
to
write
in
high
school
and
was
therefore
dumbfounded
by
Lafayette
expectations.
I
was
intimidated
by
college,
and
resigned
to
English
101
as
a
Frosh.
I
couldn't
believe
the
preparation
many
of
my
classmates
lacked.
Basic
skills,
and
abilities
were
shocking.
The
class
participated
in
peer
editing
and
revision,
while
I
seemed
to
be
going
though
a
confusing
step
of
displacement.
Could
this
be
college
writing?
I
thought.
While
I
eventually
learned
to
explore
new
territories
my
first
year
such
as
creative
fictions,
something
my
high
school
didn't
emphasize,
my
sophomore
year
was
completely
different.
I
was
studying
French
literature,
language
and
politics
in
Paris
taught
by
natives
in
their
native
language.
I
was
thrilled
to
learn
everything
over
again,
along
with
a
cultural
style
for
writing
as
well.
For
a
year
I
forgot
English
and
English
traditional
tools
of
writing.
It
came
as
a
refreshing
and
long
awaited
challenge
which
I
tackled
head
on.
Last
year,
returning
to
Lafayette,
I
was
meet
with
new
and
equally
challenging
assignments
as
I
changed
one
of
my
majors
from
Politics
to
A&S.
Group
writing
soon
became
a
pattern
in
each
Anthropology
course
and
hit
me
like
a
ton
of
bricks.
The
skill,
which
I
had
never
before
tried,
made
my
blood
boil.
Was
it
possible
to
create
a
single,
solid
piece
of
literature
out
of
several
random
students?
Yes!
Not
only
does
this
method
succeed,
but
often
it
is
more
likely
to
succeed
over
solo
efforts.
Collegiate
writing
has
been
a
job
because
my
majors,
Anthropology
and
Sociology/French,
require
the
skill
with
out
lapse.
Each
semester
requires
that
my
writing
format
adapts
to
new
demands.
Each
semester
has
forced
me
to
manipulate
my
comfortable
style
of
writing,
and
create
new
ones.
Through
practice
and
effort
at
the
computer
I
want
to
create
a
high
level
of
confidence
and
aptitude
that
will
fulfill
each
ethnography,
thesis,
French
poem
or
science
lab.
Hopefully
though
my
experiences
as
a
writing
assistant
I
will
be
able
to
teach
and
learn
these
writing
goals.
