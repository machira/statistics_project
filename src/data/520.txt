My
Literacy
Narrative
D
WA
Writing
Assignment
When
I
look
back
at
the
past
year
and
at
my
role
as
a
writing
associate,
I
find
myself
constantly
reminding
myself
that
it
has
only
been
a
year.
The
truth
is,
considering
the
Ngrowth
processO
that
I
went
through
as
a
writing
associate,
it
could
easily
have
the
lifespan
of
an
entire
childhood.
Childhood
is
a
crucial
time
in
the
development
of
an
individual.
Thus,
being
a
Psychology
major,
I
am
a
firm
believer
in
that
what
occurs
in
our
childhood
greatly
impacts
our
future
lives
and
behavior.
Every
single
event
leads
up
to
a
greater
event
and
it
is
during
our
childhood
that
we
learn
how
to
deal
with
these
particular
situations.
In
doing
so,
our
actions
map
out
who
we
choose
to
become
as
individuals.
In
this
same
way,
I
feel
as
if
being
a
writing
associate
has
enabled
me
to
grow,
both
as
an
individual
and
as
a
writer,
in
more
ways
that
I
could
ever
imagine.
However,
this
personal
growth
process
would
not
have
occurred
if
I
had
not
been
faced
with
the
particular
challenges
that
every
writing
associate
inevitably
experiences.
When
I
first
started
my
position
as
a
WA,
I
was
quite
apprehensive
and
unsure
of
my
abilities.
Like
a
child,
I
was
still
trying
to
figure
out
my
position
in
the
NWA
world,O
as
well
as
attempting
to
determine
what
methods
I
liked
best
and
what
I
was
the
most
comfortable
with.
I
had
to
try
countless
different
ways
of
approaching
a
paper
and
approaching
a
conference
until
I
found
one
that
I
was
the
most
comfortable
with.
However,
this
was
not
an
easy
process.
After
the
first
training
session
that
took
place
during
the
summer,
I
recalled
feeling
unstable
and
unsure
of
what
was
expected
out
of
me,
but
now
I
realize
that
if
I
had
never
felt
that
way,
I
never
would
have
formed
my
own
techniques
and
my
own
ways
of
conferring
with
students.
Upon
entering
the
training
session,
I
expected
to
be
taught
how
to
be
a
good
WA,
but
when
this
was
not
accomplished,
I
gradually
realized
that
I
had
to
teach
myself.
As
children,
we
are
taught
to
find
out
what
we
enjoy
doing
best,
which
enables
us
to
develop
our
strengths
and
weaknesses.
We
accomplish
this
by
dabbling
in
various
sports
and
extracurricular
activities.
Additionally,
creating
interactions
and
social
connections
with
others
helps
us
find
what
we
like
doing
best.
All
of
the
above
ultimately
allow
us
to
create
our
own
paths
in
life.
Similarly,
as
a
WA,
I
initially
found
myself
experimenting
with
various
methods.
In
the
process
of
doing
so,
I
encountered
obstacles,
but
eventually
overcame
them.
When
I
found
that
I
did
not
like
one
method
that
I
was
using,
or
that
a
student
was
not
responding
well
to
a
particular
method,
I
would
try
a
different
method
the
next
time.
I
quickly
learned
that
every
student
is
different
and
that
more
often
that
not,
I
would
have
to
adjust
my
typical
techniques
for
a
specific
student.
Remarkably,
when
I
look
back
at
my
conferences
from
the
fall
semester
and
compare
them
with
the
conferences
that
took
place
in
the
spring
semester,
I
am
able
to
see
such
a
dramatic
difference.
During
the
fall
semester,
I
worked
with
freshmen
who
were
unfamiliar
with
the
WA
program
and
how
to
approach
conferences.
As
a
result,
I
found
myself
taking
the
lead
in
these
conferences,
by
asking
them
questions
and
giving
them
suggestions.
In
the
second
semester,
I
worked
with
sophomores
who
were
very
familiar
with
the
writing
program.
However,
they
were
different
from
the
freshmen
in
that
they
took
more
charge
of
the
conferences
and
often
had
more
to
say.
However,
my
authority
was
still
mainly
present
in
the
majority
of
these
conferences.
While
I
enjoyed
the
authority
I
possessed,
I
still
felt
as
if
something
was
missing.
After
the
majority
of
the
first
conferences
took
place,
I
realized
that
student
involvement
was
the
crucial
aspect
missing
and
that
something
had
to
be
done
to
fix
this.
While
the
sophomores
that
I
worked
with
were
mostly
responsive
and
more
talkative
during
conferences,
I
knew
that
their
participation
could
be
further
heightened.
As
for
the
freshmen,
they
needed
to
be
realize
that
communication
is
key
in
a
WA
conference.
Before
I
actually
started
my
position
as
a
WA
and
held
conferences
with
the
students,
I
asked
myself
what
my
expectations
were
D
what
I
expected
out
of
myself
and
out
of
the
students.
One
of
the
top
items
on
my
list
was
student
participation
and
to
encourage
the
students
to
correct
their
own
mistakes.
After
all,
they
are
the
ones
who
understand
their
paper
the
best.
I
knew
that
I
did
not
want
to
be
the
one
telling
the
students
how
to
re-word
a
sentence
or
make
an
idea
more
coherent
and
logical.
Simply,
I
felt
that
my
job
was
to
guide
them.
Thus,
after
the
first
conferences
took
place,
I
reminded
myself
of
my
initial
expectations
and
thought
of
ways
to
fulfill
these
expectations.
By
heeding
the
advice
of
my
fellow
WAOs
and
watching
how
the
students
I
worked
with
responded
to
my
suggestions,
I
was
able
to
come
up
with
various
ways
to
encourage
student
participation.
Of
course,
I
quickly
learned
that
every
WA
is
always
going
to
encounter
students
who
are
simply
unwilling
to
participate.
When
I
was
faced
with
this
type
of
obstacle,
I
found
myself
feeling
very
frustrated
and
unable
to
fulfill
my
duty
as
a
WA.
I
learned
that
you
cannot
let
this
type
of
student
hinder
you,
but
at
the
same
time,
you
cannot
give
up
on
them.
No
matter
how
frustrated
I
felt,
I
refused
to
allow
the
student
to
overwhelm
me
and
prevent
me
from
doing
my
job.
As
told
in
my
narrative
from
last
year,
I
was
instilled
with
a
firm
belief
in
never
giving
up,
and
I
refused
to
abandon
this
belief.
Instead
of
succumbing
to
a
particular
student,
as
I
initially
thought
I
would
do,
I
used
their
lack
of
motivation
to
motivate
me
even
further
and
to
try
even
harder
with
him
or
her.
In
order
to
accomplish
this,
I
would
employ
various
techniques
with
the
student
and
try
to
formulate
ways
to
make
them
participate
more
and
care
more
about
the
paper.
Additionally,
I
would
ask
questions
during
staff
meetings
regarding
solutions
to
this
specific
problem.
Whatever
suggestions
I
received,
I
would
use
these
in
the
next
conference
with
the
student.
In
general,
I
took
advantage
of
the
tools
that
were
put
out
in
front
of
me
and
try
to
use
every
possible
one.
In
the
end,
although
the
change
in
a
studentOs
level
of
involvement
was
never
as
drastic
as
I
imagined
it
to
be,
it
was
still
significant.
Also,
because
I
had
tried
as
many
possible
ways
of
encouraging
more
participation,
I
felt
more
than
satisfied
in
knowing
that
I
tried
everything
that
I
possibly
could.
On
the
other
hand,
there
were
also
the
students
who
were
NidealO
WA
students
D
they
actively
participated,
asked
questions,
wrote
down
their
own
suggestions
and
corrections,
et
cetera.
I
greatly
enjoyed
working
with
these
students
because
I
always
felt
a
huge
sense
of
accomplishment
after
the
conferences.
However,
I
have
to
say
that
I
probably
liked
working
with
the
more
difficult
students
better
than
the
easy
ones.
I
enjoy
a
challenge,
and
it
is
true
that
every
obstacle
that
we
face
only
makes
us
stronger
in
the
end.
In
working
with
the
more
difficult
and
unwilling
students,
I
was
forced
to
be
more
creative,
more
thoughtful,
more
responsive,
patient,
and
encouraging
D
all
in
an
attempt
to
somehow
motivate
the
student
to
actively
and
vocally
participate
in
the
conference.
In
doing
all
of
this,
I
gained
more
out
of
the
challenging
conference
than
I
normally
would
have
with
a
successful
one
because
I
learned
something
new.
I
believe
that
in
the
process
I
became
a
stronger
WA
and
better
able
to
do
my
job.
After
all,
whatever
I
learn
or
achieve
in
one
conference
often
carries
itself
over
to
another
conference.
This
greatly
benefits
the
student,
as
well.
While
I
became
a
stronger
WA,
I
also
became
stronger
as
an
individual.
Going
back
to
my
childhood
theory
--
as
children,
we
also
gradually
achieve
our
sense
of
self-confidence
and
self-esteem
and
our
successes
and
failures
greatly
influence
these
levels.
Similarly,
successes
and
failures
that
I
have
encountered
in
the
past
year
as
a
WA
have
both
affected
and
altered
my
level
of
confidence.
As
I
previously
mentioned,
going
into
the
conferences
that
I
had
with
students,
I
was
extremely
nervous
and
uncertain
of
my
abilities.
At
that
point,
I
had
not
yet
felt
as
if
I
was
entirely
suitable
to
be
a
WA.
Acting
as
if
I
was
a
pessimist
(which
is
unlike
me),
I
had
convinced
myself
that
things
would
go
terribly
wrong,
that
I
would
not
do
a
satisfactory
job,
that
the
students
wouldnOt
like
me,
et
cetera.
These
are
only
a
few
of
the
many
fears
that
I
faced.
I
always
considered
myself
to
be
a
confident
person,
especially
in
my
abilities.
However,
when
I
realized
that
my
confidence
was
being
challenged
before
the
very
first
conferences,
I
forced
myself
to
push
aside
any
doubts
that
I
may
have
had.
When
I
realized
that
the
conferences
were
going
as
well
as
they
could
possibly
go
at
the
time
and
that
the
students
were
not
wary
of
my
abilities,
I
was
able
to
regain
my
self-confidence.
I
finally
understood
that
the
students
thought
that
I
was
their
WA
for
a
reason,
and
I
was.
Throughout
the
course
of
the
year,
I
have
had
to
remind
myself
(at
the
risk
of
sounding
conceited)
that
the
advisors
picked
me
to
be
a
WA
because
they
thought
that
I
could
do
the
job.
If
they
thought
that
I
was
insufficient
to
be
a
WA,
then
they
certainly
would
not
have
hired
me
for
the
position.
Similarly,
the
students
knew
this
(probably
better
than
I
did,
at
the
time)
and
understood
that
I
was
quite
capable.
As
a
result,
their
eagerness
to
see
what
I
could
do
for
them
and
their
papers
encouraged
me
to
be
confident
in
my
abilities.
Regaining
my
confidence
greatly
played
a
role
in
allowing
me
to
feel
as
if
I
have
been
a
good
WA.
As
I
look
back
on
memorable
conferences
that
I
have
had
in
the
past
year,
I
have
been
trying
to
figure
out
what
else
allowed
for
successful
conferences.
I
think
that
one
extremely
important
part
of
being
a
WA
is
having
the
ability
to
create
a
good
balance
between
being
a
WA
and
also
being
a
peer.
Often
times,
I
have
forgotten
that
the
students
that
I
work
with
are
no
more
than
about
three
years
older
or
younger
than
me.
They
are
my
peers
and
I
am
theirs.
It
can
be
difficult
for
some
to
create
this
fine
balance
and
to
use
their
authority
while
at
the
same
time,
trying
to
be
a
peer
or
friend
to
the
student.
However,
I
found
it
easy
to
establish
this
balance
between
the
two
because
I
am
a
comfortable
person
and
I
have
always
thought
that
I
have
the
unique
ability
to
put
people
at
ease.
I
will
admit
that
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
be
both
a
WA
and
a
peer
to
your
students
and
that
I
have
certainly
been
put
in
awkward
situations
before.
I
think
that
it
can
take
some
time
to
overcome
this,
but
every
WA
has
the
ability
do
to
so!
Once
this
balance
is
achieved,
I
think
that
every
WA
will
find
their
future
conferences
to
be
extremely
successful.
Gaining
utmost
confidence
in
my
abilities
is
probably
the
most
influential
thing
that
I
have
received
from
being
a
WA
for
the
past
year.
However,
while
I
think
about
it
now,
I
am
realizing
that
being
a
WA
has
changed
how
I
view
my
own
papers
that
I
write
to
this
day.
I
have
noticed
that
I
proofread
my
papers
from
a
much
more
analytical
perspective
than
from
a
grammatical
or
Nfine-tuningO
perspective.
Instead
of
rereading
papers
for
simple
errors,
I
reread
them
for
analytical
and
thought
errors.
I
look
for
ideas
that
do
not
make
sense
or
seem
illogical
or
out
of
place.
I
make
sure
that
I
have
a
firm
and
concise
thesis
and
that
the
body
of
my
paper
supports
this
thesis.
I
look
for
a
strong
introduction
and
conclusion.
Basically,
I
look
for
things
that
I
look
for
in
every
single
paper
that
I
read
and
I
can
honestly
say
that,
in
the
past,
I
did
not
do
this
too
often.
Gradually,
I
have
been
NweanedO
from
the
whole
Ngrammar
is
essentialO
theory
and
this
is
reflected
in
my
own
papers
that
I
write.
Having
looked
back
on
the
past
year
and
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
it
has
been
a
very
good
year
as
a
WA,
I
am
extremely
confident
that
this
upcoming
year
will
be
even
more
successful
and
productive.
It
definitely
seems
like
this
past
year
has
been
my
NchildhoodO
as
a
WA
and
now
I
am
ready
to
move
onto
the
NadulthoodO
phase.
I
have
experimented
with
various
methods
and
learned
from
every
single
conference
that
I
have
had,
and
as
a
result,
I
will
use
my
successes
and
failures
to
mold
future
conferences.
This
past
year
has
helped
me
reach
the
level
of
confidence
that
I
would
like
to
be
at
and
since
this
confidence
is
already
established,
this
next
year
will
be
very
rewarding.
I
am
quite
certain
that
it
will
hold
many
more
successes
and
failures
for
me,
but
it
will
somehow
benefit
me
and
the
student
in
some
way.
Being
a
WA
is
a
constant
learning
process
and
as
long
as
you
are
receptive
and
willing
to
change
your
ways,
you
are
putting
yourself
on
the
path
for
ultimate
success
as
a
WA.
I
can
certainly
say
that
it
is
a
very
rewarding
experience
and
I
am
excited
to
see
the
future
rewards
and
benefits
that
being
a
WA
will
bring.
