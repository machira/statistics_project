NMy
History
as
a
WriterO
My
parents
always
considered
me
Nthe
reader
of
the
family.O
Although
not
entirely
a
bookworm,
I
regularly
read
more
books
than
both
of
my
older
siblings;
thus,
from
a
young
age
I
was
aware
of
my
inclination
towards
reading.
In
addition,
as
I
became
a
better
reader,
I
realized
that
I
enjoyed
writing
as
well.
I
can
clearly
remember
all
of
my
teachers
from
elementary
school
preaching
the
importance
of
reading,
as
well
as
how
it
is
essential
in
order
to
be
a
great
writer.
Therefore
I
read
and
wrote
as
much
as
possible
so
that
I
could
attain
both
talents.
I
ultimately
learned
that
a
great
writer
always
begins
as
a
great
reader.
Additionally,
because
as
a
youth
I
was
primarily
a
fan
of
reading
fiction,
I
was
prone
to
writing
fiction
creatively
at
an
early
age.
I
would
write
complete
stories
from
my
own
imagination
or
simply
develop
my
own
revolving
around
familiar
characters
(whether
it
be
Spider-Man,
Buzz
Lightyear,
or
another).
Moreover,
in
hindsight,
I
think
that
my
admiration
for
creative
writing
while
young
has
ultimately
made
me
a
better
writer
altogether.
As
opposed
to
students
who
only
wrote
when
he
or
she
needed
to
and
were
graded
upon
it
(assigned
essays,
for
example),
I
was
writing
in
both
this
fashion
and
the
more
stress-free,
creative
writing
sphere.
Throughout
elementary
school
there
were
two
distinct
and
separate
worlds
in
which
I
wrote:
my
own
imaginative
world
and
the
strict,
factual
realm
of
rhetoric.
Alas,
it
was
only
when
I
was
halfway
through
high
school
when
I
realized
that
these
two
approaches
to
writing
need
not
be
so
separated.
Indeed,
I
believe
that
I
truly
realized
my
potential
when
I
blended
these
two
approaches
based
upon
creativity
and
realism
within
my
writing.
I
had
never
particularly
enjoyed
my
English
and
Literature
classes
up
until
my
junior
year.
Each
essay
I
wrote
was
predictably
about
discussing
or
comparing
literary
devices
between
one
text
and
another.
Furthermore,
I
never
felt
engaged
or
worried
whilst
writing
these
essays.
In
my
mind
they
were
fairly
simple
because
I
was
confident
in
my
reading
and
writing
prowess;
however,
my
English
teacher
in
my
junior
year
issued
an
assignment
that
I
finally
found
challenging.
The
assignment
initially
seemed
easy;
the
class
was
allowed
to
develop
his
or
her
own
thesis
while
incorporating
literature
read
over
the
course
of
the
year.
Moreover,
this
essay
did
not
need
to
be
written
as
a
NtraditionalO
essay
and
could
contain
elements
of
fiction,
as
well.
Originally
I
thought
that
this
essay
would
be
as
easy
as
I
had
come
to
expect
from
an
English
essay,
however,
I
eventually
found
it
incredibly
difficult
to
decide
what
to
write
about.
I
started
the
essay
as
I
would
any
other,
without
planning
and
in
one
sitting;
however,
I
ultimately
found
myself
struggling
to
develop
a
comprehensive
thesis.
Therefore,
it
was
while
writing
this
essay
that
I
finally
discovered
the
importance
of
planning.
When
planning
an
essay
prior
to
writing
it,
I
have
found
that
the
writing
is
always
a
bit
more
cohesive.
Rather
than
simply
ramble
off
whatever
comes
to
mind,
planning
an
essay
beforehand
will
help
the
writer
connect
the
thesis
throughout
the
entirety
of
the
argument.
In
addition,
I
felt
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
develop
an
all-encompassing
thesis
for
this
particular
essay
because
there
was
no
prompt
for
guidance.
As
I
struggled
more
and
more
to
establish
my
argument,
I
eventually
realized
that
planning
was
a
necessity.
In
addition,
the
essay
ultimately
turned
out
to
be
one
of
my
most
prized
writings.
I
received
an
A
on
the
paper
and
wonderful
feedback
from
my
teacher.
I
was
particularly
ecstatic
by
my
teacherOs
reaction
because
the
essay
was
one
of
the
first
pieces
that
I
worked
on
vehemently.
Moreover,
the
essay
could
have
been
about
anything
that
I
wanted,
thus,
I
was
proud
that
I
was
able
to
develop
an
efficient
thesis
as
well
as
make
it
compelling.
Furthermore,
the
next
essay
that
I
spent
a
great
amount
of
effort
on
was
the
one
that
I
wrote
for
my
college
application.
Most
college
essays
are
merely
about
how
one
overcame
a
hardship
and
learned
from
their
mistakes,
however,
I
didnOt
want
to
write
an
essay
that
was
simple.
As
I
mulled
over
different
ideas,
I
found
myself
remembering
my
love
of
fiction
and
writing
creatively
as
a
child.
I
started
to
develop
a
Nrealistically
fictionalO
story
that
corresponded
to
a
period
of
growth
in
my
life.
For
example,
I
was
heartbroken
after
the
death
of
my
dog,
Roxie.
Months
later
my
family
seemingly
replaced
Roxie
with
a
new
dog,
Bino.
While
planning
an
essay
in
which
I
discussed
my
feelings
of
loss
for
Roxie
and
apprehension
towards
Bino,
I
couldnOt
quite
figure
out
how
to
make
the
essay
different
than
the
prototypical
essays
that
college
administrators
have
probably
come
to
expect.
At
last
I
incorporated
an
imaginative
plot
point
in
which
I
conversed
with
Roxie,
and
later
Bino.
The
tone
of
the
conversations
changed
as
I
dealt
with
RoxieOs
death,
as
well
as
mirroring
the
internal
changes
I
made
to
become
a
more
responsible
young
man.
To
this
day
I
still
think
that
it
is
one
of
the
best
pieces
I
have
ever
written.
Furthermore,
one
reason
that
I
think
I
was
so
satisfied
with
my
work
was
because
I
spent
such
an
extensive
amount
of
time
on
each
individual
draft.
Additionally,
I
think
my
incorporation
of
fiction
into
the
essay
effectively
reflected
my
writing
method.
I
have
been
a
fan
of
fiction
and
creative
writing
since
my
youth;
thus,
I
feel
that
integrating
it
into
an
essay
that
is
supposed
to
reflect
my
sense
of
self
to
others
really
induced
its
quality.
Likewise,
this
realization
that
multiple
drafts
are
necessary
in
order
to
write
a
great
essay
would
later
on
help
me
once
I
went
to
college,
however,
the
realization
did
not
come
easy.
My
first
semester
at
school
was
easily
my
weakest.
I
figured
that
I
would
be
able
to
get
by
with
the
same
amount
of
effort
that
I
utilized
while
in
high
school.
Whereas
I
would
be
able
to
get
great
grades
without
working
too
hard
in
high
school,
it
took
me
an
entire
semester
to
learn
that
I
must
try
harder
in
college.
In
addition,
I
got
a
severe
wake-up
call
in
my
First
Year
Seminar
class.
I
submitted
a
paper
that
I
had
written
the
night
before
it
was
due
and
didnOt
attach
a
bibliography
(which,
unbeknownst
to
me,
is
a
necessity
for
nearly
every
college
paper).
I
was
livid
after
receiving
a
D
on
this
essay,
however,
I
donOt
regret
it.
If
I
didnOt
receive
such
a
bad
grade
then
I
might
not
have
learned
to
put
forth
more
effort
when
working
on
an
assignment.
The
following
semester
I
worked
harder
and
longer
on
my
assignments.
One
of
the
prime
examples
of
my
newfound
work
ethic
would
be
the
final
paper
that
I
wrote
for
my
NFantasyO
class.
More
specifically,
it
easily
reflects
the
importance
of
multiple
drafts
in
my
writing.
Writing
a
paper
that
is
expected
to
be
ten
pages
or
more
was
extremely
daunting
to
me
when
I
first
came
to
Lafayette.
Although
I
had
recently
realized
that
papers
should
not
be
written
in
just
one
sitting,
I
did
usually
only
spend
a
few
days
at
most
on
a
single
paper.
For
this
final,
however,
I
figured
that
it
would
satisfy
me
best
if
I
wrote
as
many
drafts
as
possible
over
a
significant
amount
of
time.
Eventually
I
found
that
not
only
are
longer
papers
easier
to
write
when
written
in
multiple
sessions,
but
also
help
when
editing
and
reflecting
said
paper.
It
is
much
easier,
in
my
opinion,
to
edit
a
paper
when
one
hasnOt
read
it
recently.
I
feel
that
this
waiting
period
gives
the
reader
a
bit
of
distance
to
more
adequately
revise
the
writing.
Moreover,
utilizing
multiple
drafts
was
very
helpful
for
the
evolution
of
oneOs
thesis.
The
ideas
and
opinions
that
are
incorporated
into
the
thesis
can
be
organized
differently,
as
well
as
more
effectively,
when
developing
oneOs
argument.
I
have
also
found
it
helpful
to
save
all
of
my
drafts
even
if
I
have
gone
a
different
direction
with
the
paper.
Oftentimes
I
have
found
ways
to
incorporate
some
of
my
older
ideas
into
new
arguments.
The
importance
of
multiple
drafts
has
grown
on
me
even
more
after
taking
creative
writing
my
last
semester
at
Lafayette.
I
have
certainly
written
creatively
prior
to
the
class,
however,
I
havenOt
had
to
face
criticism.
Oftentimes
ideas
that
I
did
not
like
while
originally
writing
were
welcomed
later
on
whilst
working
on
my
next
draft
and
vice
versa.
Furthermore,
this
class
really
opened
up
my
eyes
when
it
comes
to
editing
the
work
of
others
as
well
as
my
own.
Initially
it
was
a
bit
awkward
discussing
texts
and
openly
criticizing
it
in
front
of
the
writer,
yet,
it
was
an
extremely
helpful
experience.
It
really
made
me
more
comfortable
discussing
problems
that
I
experience
with
my
own
writing.
Just
as
often
as
I
would
read
the
work
of
another
individual
and
feel
that
mine
was
superior,
I
would
read
a
piece
and
feel
like
mine
was
like
a
childrenOs
book
in
comparison.
The
class
was
liberating
in
that
sense;
I
was
able
to
see
how
others
my
age
were
writing
and
use
it
to
alter
my
own
writing.
Additionally,
although
I
was
no
stranger
to
creative
writing
prior
to
this
class,
I
was
completely
unfamiliar
with
writing
poetry.
There
were
some
students
in
my
class
who
could
seemingly
write
elaborate,
elegant
poems
while
half
asleep.
I
had
never
been
a
big
fan
of
poetry,
either.
Therefore
I
found
it
extremely
difficult
initially
to
not
only
write
a
poem,
but
to
more
specifically
write
an
enjoyable
poem.
I
never
particularly
read
poetry
in
my
spare
time,
thus
I
wasnOt
aware
that
there
were
so
many
diverse
poetic
devices
that
a
writer
must
keep
in
mind.
For
example,
I
struggled
significantly
with
meter.
How
was
I
supposed
to
create
a
sophisticatedly
sounding
poem
with
a
consistent
syllable
count
while
also
rhyming?
This
was
a
new
dilemma
that
I
experienced
in
the
realm
of
writing
that
I
had
not
previously
dealt
with.
I
found
that
reading
the
poetry
of
others,
both
famed
poets
and
students
alike,
really
helped
form
my
own
approach
to
poetry.
Furthermore,
it
also
led
me
to
entirely
new
genres.
For
example,
prose
poetry
was
a
genre
that
I
had
been
completely
unaware
of.
Another
student
in
my
class
wrote
an
incredibly
whimsical
short
story
that
read
extremely
poetic,
as
well.
I
initially
thought
that
it
was
her
specific
method
of
writing
that
astonished
me
so;
however,
I
later
learned
that
it
was
actually
an
entire
genre
of
writing.
This
approach
ended
up
really
appealing
to
me
because
I
felt
that
it
was
a
more
amicable
entry
into
the
realm
of
poetry.
My
approach
to
writing
has
consistently
changed
over
the
years.
As
I
write
more
often,
I
feel
that
I
put
more
effort
into
each
new
piece.
I
have
spent
more
time
planning
and
editing
my
essays,
as
well
as
working
on
each
individual
draft.
Furthermore,
I
have
broadened
my
horizons
in
terms
of
the
different
genres
that
I
am
accustomed
to.
Rather
than
simply
approach
each
academic
assignment
with
the
rhetorical
mindset,
I
now
try
to
find
new
ways
to
diversify
my
writing
from
others.
Most
importantly
perhaps,
though,
I
have
never
stopped
reading.
I
still
believe
that
my
prowess
in
writing
while
I
was
young
was
developed
by
my
love
for
reading.
Thus,
to
continue
to
improve
my
writing
skills,
I
continue
to
read
more
and
more.
