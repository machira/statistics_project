My
Literary
Narrative
Purple
squiggly
hair,
a
blue
triangle
head,
red
high
heels,
and
a
flat,
two-dimensional
smile.
Doesn't
the
saying
go
"A
picture
says
a
thousand
words?"
My
love
for
drawing
developed
when
I
was
extremely
young.
I
enjoyed
reading
and
liked
capturing
my
imagination
in
pictures.
However,
as
my
drawings
and
paintings
became
more
abstract,
well,
as
abstract
as
any
four-year-old's,
I
realized
that
my
"masterpieces"
required
somewhat
of
an
explanation
to
those
viewing
them.
Pictures
no
longer
sufficed
as
a
clear
and
concise
means
of
communication.
In
kindergarten
and
first
grade
I
discovered
my
ability
and
talent,
if
you
could
call
it
that,
to
spell.
Perhaps
those
evenings
of
reading
the
dictionary
helped
my
spelling
and
increased
my
vocabulary.
However,
I
needed
to
surmise
a
way
to
incorporate
these
perfectly
spelled
and
"grown-up"
sounding
words
into
sentences
that
involved
more
than
a
subject,
verb,
and
an
inkling
of
a
thought.
Thank
goodness
for
me,
I
had
a
few
more
years
that
would
allow
me
to
draw
and
express
my
creativity
while
attempting
to
write
to
the
best
of
my
ability
as
an
elementary
school
student.
Perhaps
the
most
challenging
task
for
me,
one
that
tested
my
skills
as
a
novice
writer,
was
writing
a
hardly
scientific
report
about
Jupiter.
The
assignment
required
me
to
actually
research
in
my
favorite
place
I
had
only
known
before
as
the
place
I
went
to
for
story
time--the
library!
As
I
perused
the
shelves
studying
the
detailed
illustrations,
I
realized
that
my
report
could
possibly
mimic,
of
course
on
a
smaller
scale,
one
of
the
many
books
I
was
now
fascinated
with.
I
embarked
upon
a
great
journey
into
the
unexplored
world
of
science.
Much
to
my
satisfaction,
I
was
able
to
place
these
facts
and
newly
discovered
research
onto
paper.
With
the
assistance
of
illustrations
drawn
to
the
best
of
my
seven-year-old
ability,
the
report
on
Jupiter
enabled
me
to
express
myself,
as
well
as
what
I
learned.
Now
that
I
pretty
much
had
drawing
under
my
belt,
as
well
as
regurgitating
facts,
third
grade
still
presented
me
with
another
challenge.
In
addition
to
writing
more
complexly,
I
could
no
longer
depend
on
a
book
for
the
information
I
needed
to
complete
a
report.
My
teacher
decided
to
actually
make
me
express
my
own
opinion
by
asking
a
question
to
each
student
in
the
class.
I,
along
with
my
classmates,
had
to
provide
various
reasons
supporting
our
individual
answers
in
a
journal.
I
was
required
to
learn
how
to
express
myself,
and
I
knew
this
task
would
be
a
challenge
when
I
received
assignments
back
with
comments
that
repeatedly
posed
questions
of
"Why?"
and
"How
come?"
and
"Why
do
you
think
that?"
Initially
my
reaction
was
"She's
[my
teacher]
not
reading
this
right!"
However,
after
my
stubbornness
subsided,
I
realized
that
perhaps
I
was
not
conveying
my
thoughts
as
clearly
as
I
hoped,
and
maybe
people
really
didn't
understand
me.
This
judgment
only
made
me
think
less
of
myself,
and
I
truly
wondered
if
anyone
understood
my
thoughts.
While
I
still
"made
the
grade"
in
elementary
school,
it
was
not
until
sixth
grade
that
I
realized
my
ability
to
convey
my
thoughts
and
ideas
hindered
my
desire
to
be
understood.
By
my
failure
to
write
clearly,
I
eventually
realized
I
was
not
working
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
my
utmost
potential.
I
was
finally
in
middle
school.
My
first
year
there
was
a
big
adjustment.
I
had
new
friends,
new
teachers,
and
new,
more
advanced
assignments.
The
time
came
for
me
to
write
a
three-page
paper.
Perhaps
the
assignment
was
for
science
class
or
perhaps
it
was
for
social
studies;
I
had
the
same
teacher
for
both.
Regardless,
I
was
scared
of
both
him
and
his
assignments.
As
a
child,
I
was
very
insistent
to
do
things
myself
and
very
rarely
would
I
seek
help
unless
I
was
in
grave
danger.
My
parents
never
checked
to
see
if
I
completed
my
assignments
because
they
knew
I
was
responsible.
They
always
offered
me
help,
but
never
did
my
homework
for
me.
I
never
allowed
them
to
read
a
"masterpiece"
until
the
assignment
was
already
graded.
However,
this
first
major
assignment
for
me
in
sixth
grade
caused
me
great
despair.
I
was
extremely
frustrated
with
the
topic
because
I
was
not
interested
in
whatever
it
was,
and
I
had
no
idea
on
how
to
conduct
sixth
grade
level
research.
Little
did
I
know
that
this
period
of
frustration
and
angst
would
be
a
major
turning
point
in
my
writing
experience.
As
I
reluctantly
handed
my
paper
over
to
my
father,
I
stared
out
the
window
of
my
living
room
while
wringing
my
hands
and
shifting
from
side
to
side
on
the
sofa.
I
feared
his
comments;
I
knew
that
I
had
not
completed
the
assignment
to
the
best
of
my
ability
because
I
knew
what
I
truly
was
capable
of.
I
was
uncertain
on
how
to
write
more
sophisticatedly.
After
many
cross-outs,
arrows,
and
some
stem,
yet
encouraging
words,
my
tears
dried
and
I
became
motivated
to
prove
to
others
and
myself
that
I
could
express
myself
and
my
newly
acquired
knowledge
with
pictures
and
words.
From
that
evening
forward,
my
perspective
of
writing
changed.
As
my
career
at
middle
school
continued,
I
still
viewed
each
assignment
as
a
challenge,
but
I
had
much
more
confidence
than
ever
before.
Seventh
grade
brought
me
more
advanced
vocabulary.
Eighth
grade
permitted
me
to
gain
better
knowledge
of
grammar,
ultimately
allowing
me
to
understand
aspects
of
the
English
language
that
had
never
really
been
taught
to
me
before
like
when
to
use
"whom"
and
"who."
I
also
learned
how
to
write
more
descriptively
and
creatively,
by
incorporating
better
vocabulary,
sharply
focusing
on
a
topic,
as
well
as
using
vivid
verbs.
Upon
entrance
into
high
school,
I
concluded
after
first
reading
the
syllabus
for
my
freshman
AP
English
class,
that
as
much
as
I
found
middle
school
a
challenge,
my
assignments
did
not
prepare
me
as
well
as
I
had
hoped
for
high
school.
This
assumption
proved
correct
when
I
entered
sophomore
AP
English
class.
The
curriculum
for
sophomore
AP
English
was
world
literature.
Perhaps
I
created
my
own
doom
when
I
waited
until
the
last
possible
day
before
school
started
to
read
the
assigned
summer
reading:
The
Illiad
and
The
Odyssey.
In
addition,
we
read
Ibsen,
Shakespeare,
Rostand,
and
Angelou,
just
to
name
a
few.
I
enjoyed
the
readings,
and
I
thought
I
understood
them
to
the
best
of
my
ability.
However,
when
it
came
time
to
write
various
papers,
such
as
comparative
essays
and
character
analyses,
I
struggled
to
stick
to
my
proposed
thesis.
Mrs.
Koch
was
my
sophomore
AP
English
teacher.
I
remember
her
handing
my
first
writing
assignment
back
to
me
and
my
heart
sank.
The
white
paper
was
unidentifiable
under
all
the
red.
My
first
thought
was:
"Is
this
my
paper?
There
is
another
Stephanie
in
the
class,
maybe
it's
hers?"
However,
despite
my
wishes,
the
marred,
red-stained
paper
was
mine.
I
read
her
comments,
but
never
fully
identified
what
Mrs.
Koch
was
suggesting
I
do
to
improve
my
work.
This
lack
of
understanding
only
made
me
realize
that
I
needed
to
seek
extra
help--so
I
did.
Ever
since
that
evening
in
sixth
grade
when
I
sat
with
my
father
and
we
worked
on
my
paper,
I
had
no
reservations
to
ask
for
help
when
it
was
necessary.
With
each
additional
assignment,
I
steadily
progressed.
The
last
marking
period
that
year
in
English
class
was
titled
"Six
Books
in
Six
Weeks."
Each
student
was
required
to
read
a
book
a
week
for
six
weeks,
and
after
each
reading,
we
each
had
to
complete
a
unique
writing
assignment
of
our
choosing.
This
part
of
the
curriculum
was
less
structured
than
the
first
part
of
the
year,
so
I
felt
as
though
I
had
much
more
liberty
to
write
about
what
I
wished.
After
finishing
the
quarter
with
an
"A"
for
my
grade,
my
teacher
complimented
me
on
my
dedicated
effort
and
was
so
happy
to
see
how
much
I
had
improved.
When
I
entered
my
junior
year,
I
was
excited
for
my
AP
English
class.
The
curriculum
focused
on
American
literature.
I
was
enthusiastically
looking
forward
to
reading
works
by
authors
I
had
always
heard
about,
but
never
read
nor
knew
what
they
wrote.
My
teacher,
Mrs.
Leese,
had
us
write
creatively,
scholarly,
poetically,
and
with
each
project
and
assignment,
I
uncovered
my
ability
to
write
in
a
variety
of
genres.
The
pivotal
assignment
in
my
high
school
career
was
my
paper
comparing
Arthur
Miller's
play
Death
of
a
Salesman
to
its
film
version.
After
hours
researching
literary
and
film
criticism
in
the
county
library,
brainstorming,
outlining,
writing,
and
revising,
I
earned
an
"A."
Never
had
I
written
so
clearly,
so
concisely,
and
so
consistently
well.
Mrs.
Leese
provided
plenty
of
criticism
and
ways
to
improve
my
writing,
but
not
before
she
made
sure
to
compliment
the
"good"
aspects
of
my
work.
She
made
me
realize
that
although
I
had
written
this
paper
well,
there
was
still
much
room
for
improvement.
Her
marks
all
over
my
paper,
in
purple
pen,
not
red,
proved
to
me
that
no
matter
how
well
an
assignment
is
completed,
there
is
always
a
chance
to
make
a
work
better.
This
realization
has
driven
me
to
become
motivated
and
dedicated
to
my
assignments,
so
much
so
that
I
have
permitted
myself
to
become
somewhat
of
a
perfectionist
when
I
write.
This
characteristic
of
myself
as
a
writer
has
become
even
more
prominent
in
college.
My
last
year
in
high
school
AP
English
proved
to
involve
preparation
for
the
AP
test.
Perhaps
what
I
learned
about
writing
that
year
was
not
in
my
English
class,
but
was
actually
involved
with
my
college
application
process.
Mrs.
Leese
assisted
me
with
my
necessary
and
very
important
college
essay.
I
spent
hours
after-school
with
her
cutting
down,
focusing
on
a
topic,
and
writing
concise
and
descriptive
images.
She
helped
me
hone
my
very
large
topic
of
my
trip
to
Russia
into
a
narrative
of
my
experience
of
living
with
a
Russian
girl
for
three
days.
Her
input
and
dedication
to
me
truly
made
my
high
school
writing
experience
a
transformational
and
maturing
one.
After
the
summer
of
my
senior
year
in
high
school
ended,
I
was
a
nervous
wreck.
Besides
the
whole
change
of
moving
away
from
family
and
friends,
I
really
was
anxious
about
my
preparation
for
college
academics.
Not
really
knowing
what
to
expect,
I
remember
fretting
to
one
of
my
newfound
friends
about
our
first
writing
assignment
for
our
FYS.
The
assignment
was
a
paper
focusing
on
some
aspect
of
an
historical
event.
However,
I
did
not
know
what
research
to
use,
how
to
write
the
paper,
and
what
to
expect
for
a
grade.
Thank
goodness
for
my
WA.
She
helped
to
calm
my
fears,
and
she
did
sympathized
with
my
anxieties.
After
my
first
real
college
assignment
was
over,
I
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief.
I
had
made
it
through
the
first
of
the
many
academic
challenges
here
at
Lafayette.
During
my
sophomore
year,
I
enrolled
in
three
classes
that
required
a
lot
of
writing.
I
enjoyed
my
college
writing
class,
and
my
professor
opened
my
eye
to
detail.
She
also
provided
me
with
positive
and
negative
feedback.
The
addition
of
peer
review
sessions
also
enabled
me
to
learn
more
about
my
writing
and
how
others
interpret
it.
The
realization
that
still
not
everyone
understood
my
writing
made
me
focus
on
and
correct
those
aspects
of
my
writing.
Vague
descriptions
and
long,
circuitous
sentences
were
modified
and
fixed,
so
that
my
fellow
peers
could
understand
my
thesis
and
the
examples
I
used
to
support
it.
Perhaps
one
of
the
most
honest
and
funny
incidents
occurred
on
one
of
my
assignments
for
a
200-level
history
class.
My
professor
mailed
my
end
of
semester
graded
work
home
in
a
manila
envelope
to
allow
me
to
read
his
comments
on
my
work.
After
ripping
open
the
envelope
and
seeing
my
final
paper
and
comparative
book
review
covered
in
red,
I
began
to
read
the
comments
on
the
pages.
The
last
page
of
the
comparative
book
review
stated
some
positive
comments
praising
my
work;
however,
the
negative
comments
focused
on
the
need
for
me
to
read
my
assignments
aloud
to
pick
up
on
any
run-ons
and
fragments.
However,
my
professor's
suggestion
had
already
been
implemented.
I
read
every
assignment
aloud,
including
my
comparative
book
review.
I
guess
I
was
not
the
perfectionist
I
thought
I
was.
His
suggestions
came
as
a
result
of
some
sentences
being
redundant
and
"monotonous,"
thus
making
the
paper
quite
"boring."
After
recovering
from
the
initial
shock
of
such
blunt
statements,
I
smiled
and
laughed
because
I
knew
I
tried
as
best
I
could
and
still
received
a
good
grade,
but
that
his
comments
reminded
me
that
there
is
still
always
room
for
improvement.
My
VAST
course
urged
me
to
become
even
more
self-disciplined
because
of
its
lack
of
structure.
However,
this
provided
me
with
the
opportunity
to
explore
topics
I
never
thought
I'd
be
able
to
explore.
Again
like
my
FYS,
I
was
anxious
as
to
what
to
expect
and
my
WA
provided
me
with
encouragement
and
suggestions,
while
making
me
continually
support
my
thesis.
While
I
still
sat
in
nervousness
as
my
WA
read
my
paper,
I
knew
that
all
her
suggestions
would
be
worthwhile
to
consider
so
that
I
could
write
to
the
best
of
my
ability.
As
I
reflect
back
to
childhood
and
see
its
connection
to
now,
I
have
realized
that
my
freedom
to
express
my
thoughts,
my
goals,
and
myself
has
always
been
an
integral
part
to
my
person.
My
transformation
from
a
picture
drawing
abstract
artist,
to
a
fearful
child
afraid
of
failing
in
sixth
grade,
to
a
still
struggling,
yet
more
confident
writer
in
high
school,
to
a
more
concise
and
assistance-seeking
college
student,
I
am
happy
with
my
progress.
I
hope
that
my
transformation
as
a
writer
continues
as
I
venture
throughout
my
college
journey.
Although
my
love
for
drawing
and
art
still
remains
strong,
I
have
realized
that
pictures
only
capture
thoughts,
but
words
carry
them.
