Returning
WA
assignment
As
I
often
do
when
asked
to
comment
on
myself
as
a
writer,
I
will
inform
the
reader
that
I
do
not
like
to
write.
I
find
it
to
be
a
slow
process
that
accomplishes
little
for
myself.
Perhaps
this
seems
like
the
wrong
thing
for
a
writing
associate
to
begin
the
semester
by
saying,
but
it
holds
as
true
today
as
it
did
when
I
first
started
writing.
I'm
not
against
written
work
by
any
means,
I
enjoy
reading
very
much
and
take
as
much
from
it
as
I
can.
I
enjoy
assisting
the
students
that
I
am
a
writing
associate
for.
When
I
read
a
work
by
another
person
I
am
learning
something
and
taking
in
new
information.
When
I
write
I
am
just
repeating
something
I
already
know.
I
feel
as
though
the
growth
from
the
writing
process
is
the
research
and
prewriting
experience
that
an
author
must
accomplish
before
actually
presenting
a
finished
work.
I
know
this
idea
isn't
widely
shared,
but
as
an
engineer
whose
writing
assignments
often
are
the
presentation
of
accumulated
scientific
knowledge,
I
don't
feel
enchanted
like
some
school-boy
sitting
under
a
tree
and
scribbling
while
observing
the
beauty
before
him.
With
that
now
said,
I
can
focus
on
the
task
at
hand
and
answer
the
questions
before
me.
I
find
it
necessary
to
alert
you
to
the
fact
that
I
won't
be
including
any
dreamy
images
of
the
night
I
came
home
from
a
WA
meeting
and
discovered
the
writer
inside
who
has
been
yearning
to
shine
all
these
years.
Because
writing
is
obviously
part
of
society,
and
if
I
ever
wish
to
have
someone
teach
me
with
their
writing,
I
must
produce
some
of
my
own.
This
has
required
that
I
evolve
as
a
writer.
For
me,
Writing
like
a
WA
translates
more
into
reading
like
a
WA.
The
first
words
I
put
down
on
a
paper
aren't
usually
going
to
be
the
words
which
appear
on
the
final
draft.
The
original
writing
process
is
only
there
to
present
the
ideas
that
I
will
write
about.
Much
as
when
a
student
will
come
to
a
conference
with
a
relatively
raw
draft,
my
first
attempt
is
only
a
mere
sketch
of
what
is
to
come.
I
have
learned
from
my
time
as
a
writing
associate
to
mold
a
random
piece
into
something
that
others
will
understand,
enjoy,
and
take
something
from.
This
learning
has
often
come
from
viewing
the
mistakes
made
by
the
students
in
their
papers.
An
example
of
this
was
when
I
made
a
mistake
that
one
of
the
writers
I
was
a
WA
for
made.
I
was
writing
a
paper
at
the
same
time
as
him
and
struggling
with
my
own
assignment.
I
was
trying
to
cover
the
entire
architecture
of
Vienna
in
one
eight
page
paper.
Although
it
seems
foolish
now,
at
the
time
I
thought
it
was
necessary
to
fit
in
everybody
and
every
building.
It
wasnTt
until
I
was
helping
a
student
who
had
twenty
sources
for
a
three
page
essay
that
I
discovered
the
problem
with
my
paper.
I
am
one
the
laziest
perfectionists
I
know.
I
drives
me
crazy
to
not
be
able
to
fit
everything
into
a
paper
and
therefore
I
would
let
it
overwhelm
me.
I
ended
up
putting
it
off
and
doing
a
poor
job.
I
eventually
would
narrow
my
scope
because
of
time
constraints.
Now
I
start
small
and
focussed
and
can
produce
better
works
because
of
it.
Although
not
a
monumental
revelation,
this
cheesy
example
shows
that
what
is
obvious
about
a
students
paper
may
not
always
be
obvious
about
my
own
work,
even
when
the
problem
is
the
same.
One
of
the
things
I
like
to
do
with
the
papers
from
the
students
I
WA
for,
is
to
organize
them
as
I
read
them.
I
have
always
been
told
to
write
outlines
before
I
actually
sit
down
to
produce
a
draft.
It
hasn't
been
until
this
last
year
that
I
have
actually
heeded
this
advice
and
started
to
believe
that
a
little
organization
might
help.
As
in
the
way
I
will
sit
with
a
student
and
ask
them
why
they
chose
to
order
their
piece
the
way
they
did,
I
try
to
prepare
with
an
outline
that
will
help
me
not
waste
valuable
time
floundering
and
rewriting
each
part
of
my
original
draft.
Often
in
the
past
I
would
find
myself
repeating
too
much
and
not
relying
on
the
reader
to
tie
the
ideas
together
when
they
weren't
on
the
same
page.
Now,
after
reading
the
papers
for
the
WA
program,
I
realize
the
fact
that
when
a
student's
paper
repeats
the
same
message
it
becomes
tiresome
for
me
to
read.
It
can
be
equally
annoying
when
a
paper
is
missing
key
information.
This
can
also
be
avoided
by
the
use
of
an
outline.
Often
I
will
be
reading
a
student's
paper
and
a
new
idea
will
be
presented
to
me
that
is
based
on
past
knowledge
that
the
paper
is
yet
to
present.
As
I
try
to
make
my
students
aware
that
they
must
include
ideas
that
are
easily
known
to
them
but
not
all
readers,
I
must
also
remember
that
I
tend
to
do
the
same.
A
majority
of
my
papers
are
lab
reports.
Granted
there
is
not
a
large
amount
of
room
for
poetic
grace
(not
a
problem
for
me)
,
but
there
should
still
be
an
inclusion
of
the
basic
facts.
Last
semester
I
was
the
writing
associate
for
a
class
I
had
already
taken,
therefore;
I
knew
the
concepts
and
specific
information
on
paper
topics.
This
made
it
difficult
to
distance
myself
from
the
class
and
realize
that
for
a
paper
to
be
effective,
the
writer
must
include
ideas
that
were
obvious
to
me.
This
also
carries
over
into
my
writing
outside
of
the
science
field.
When
I
wrote
a
paper
this
last
year
about
the
librettist
for
Mozart,
I
knew
that
my
music
professor
possessed
a
certain
amount
of
information
on
the
subject.
I
knew
incredible
amounts
after
the
research
I
conducted
for
the
paper
and
thus,
had
to
walk
the
fine
line
of
not
being
overly
simplistic
while
not
omitting
necessary
details.
Another
important
improvement
that
I
have
drawn
from
my
year
as
a
writing
associate
is
the
attention
to
supporting
each
claim
made.
Perhaps
this
comes
from
my
engineering
background,
but
I
notice
often
that
the
students
will
make
a
claim
and
then
not
back
it
up.
This
most
often
comes
from
an
assignment
calling
for
something
to
be
discussed
and
the
writer
not
really
knowing
what
to
say.
Therefore,
I
try
to
make
sure
that
if
a
student
claims
that
airbags
are
unsafe
for
short
drivers,
they
also
explain
why
the
position
of
the
head
of
the
driver
makes
it
unsafe.
It
leads
to
a
more
complete
understanding
if
the
reader
isn't
made
to
attempt
and
guess
the
reasons
for
a
statement
being
made.
Just
as
I
will
read
a
paper
with
no
pre-knowledge
of
what
the
writer
is
discussing,
I
must
proofread
my
own
papers
with
a
blank
slate.
What
I
have
learned
from
being
a
writing
associate
may
seem
obvious,
because
it
is
just
that;
an
attention
to
the
reader's
ability
to
fully
grasp
the
ideas
presented
in
a
paper
comes
from
an
attention
to
the
obvious.
Other
aspects
of
the
program
have
also
taught
me
important
lessons.
Although
not
directly
related
to
writing
in
the
physical
sense,
I
have
learned
ways
to
have
a
better
final
paper.
Often
the
professor
will
give
an
assignment
to
the
students
and
include
a
copy
for
me.
While
the
task
set
before
the
students
may
seem
relatively
straight-forward,
often
there
are
certain
aspects
that
I
know
will
sway
the
professor's
liking
or
disliking
of
a
paper.
Usually
after
I
receive
the
assignment
I
will
go
to
the
professor
and
ask
what
he
or
she
wants
from
the
paper.
This
is
important
because
the
students,
and
myself
included,
will
be
giving
an
answer
for
the
question
posed
while
not
really
addressing
the
problem
at
hand
in
the
proper
way.
This
has
carried
over
into
my
writing
in
that
I
now
will
go
to
my
professors
and
ask
the
questions
I
have
learned
to
ask
through
the
program.
I
will
make
sure
that
the
direction
I
am
headed
doesn't
just
come
close
to
that
which
it
should
be,
but
that
I
am
on
the
path
the
instructor
had
in
mind
when
posing
the
assignment.
As
I
have
often
told
my
students
to
seek
out
the
professor
and
make
sure
that
they
aren't
straying,
I
have
learned
to
do
so
myself.
A
part
of
the
writing
associate
program
which
has
been
very
rewarding
to
me
has
been
the
growth
of
the
students
from
paper
to
paper.
Often
on
the
first
assignment,
each
of
them
will
have
some
certain
aspect
of
their
writing
which
needs
attention.
After
having
the
first
conferences,
I've
wondered
if
they
would
change
their
paper
based
on
my
suggestions,
and
it
was
always
satisfying
to
see
the
progress
that
they
would
make.
In
particular,
there
was
a
student
whose
paper
was
extremely
difficult
to
even
read
through.
It
was
extremely
frustrating
to
see
the
same
mistakes
page
after
page.
He
wrote
in
a
way
that
broke
down
the
entire
paper.
With
my
help,
we
were
able
to
make
the
paper
so
that
it
could
be
turned
in,
but
it
wasn't
the
best
it
could
be.
By
the
end
of
the
semester
his
papers
not
only
were
presentable,
but
the
best
of
the
class.
There
was
a
very
talented
writer
that
was
producing
subpar
work
because
he
had
never
gotten
over
one
hump.
That
is
what
I
take
out
of
the
program
the
most.
There
is
really
a
reward
that
is
visible
over
the
course
of
the
semester.
Rather
than
helping
and
seeing
no
return,
there
is
the
opportunity
to
watch
real
growth
-
not
only
in
the
students
but
also
the
writing
associates.
I
directly
help
them
and
through
that
process
am
able
to
learn
about
what
makes
a
better
writer,
especially
in
myself.
