Writing
on
Writing
No
matter
how
many
assignments
I
have
already
digested,
nor
numerous
pages
of
response
I
have
previously
produced,
setting
out
to
write
again
has
always
proven
a
daunting
task.
Daunting,
not
in
the
negative
sense
of
immediately
discouraging.
Rather,
daunting
as
a
recognizable
challenge,
always
ready
to
greet
me
with
expectations
of
novelty
and
further
insight
than
my
previous
excursions
along
the
continuous
lines
of
a
notebook
or
into
the
white
oblivion
of
a
fresh
Word
Document.
Thus,
I
begin
recording
the
recollections
of
the
past
fourteen
years
of
my
writing
history
at
11:47
pm,
four
days
after
reading
over
and
considering
the
daunting
mission
that
my
fingers,
my
laptop,
and
I
now
face.
Ordinarily
I
prefer
to
transfer
the
wisps
of
different
threads
of
thoughts
onto
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
before
beginning
a
formal
draft.
Recently,
the
blank
sheet
that
contains
these
potential
elements
of
a
written
piece,
like
so
many
other
aspects
of
modern
life,
resides
not
perpendicular
to
me
on
a
desk,
but
paralleled
upright
in
front
of
me
on
the
desktop
of
my
computer.
I
suppose
that
this
shift
in
mediums
has
occurred
out
of
ease,
as
these
days
my
laptop
fills
the
role
of
Nphysically
closest
friendO
D
never
failing
to
turn
up
when
I
need
it
most.
I
did
not
always
rely
so
heavily
on
a
set
of
keys
to
convey
my
ideas,
though.
Once
upon
a
time
when
the
single
household
desktop
computer
was
appreciated
as
a
novelty,
and
my
own
typing
skills
had
much
room
for
improvement,
my
written
pieces
existed
exactly
how
they
claimed
to
be
D
conceived
from
the
intimate
touch
of
a
pencil
to
a
paper.
My
first
solid
memory
involving
a
distinctly
plot-driven
piece
carries
me
back
to
the
third
grade,
when
I
wrote
and
illustrated
a
short
story
involving
a
mermaid
and
her
missing
magical
comb.
Entitled
NThe
MermaidOs
Tail,O
the
fantasy
narrative
represents
my
first
and
only
published
work,
distributed
to
fellow
students
at
Dufief
Elementary
School.
To
this
day
I
am
unsure
as
to
what
set
it
apart
from
the
other
third
grade
entries,
yet
I
cannot
help
but
envy
the
unencumbered
imagination
that
commandeered
my
thoughts
and
steered
my
third
grade
fingertips
to
glory.
I
do
not
mourn
the
loss
of
such
fantastical
ideas;
rather,
I
seek
the
path
to
find
them,
wherever
they
might
be
buried
beneath
the
depths
of
years
and
years
of
real-world
lessons
and
practicality.
My
imagination-driven
fictions
met
their
alter
ego,
the
Research
Paper,
in
fifth
grade.
As
the
written
component
to
a
science
fair
entry,
an
essay
involving
sources
and
quotes
was
assigned
to
all
fifth
grade
students.
Organization
was
heavily
emphasized
and
carefully
monitored;
index
cards,
housed
in
a
recipe
box
and
color-coded
by
the
role
the
facts
they
contained
would
potentially
serve
in
the
paper,
quickly
became
the
most
valuable
sources
of
information
and
pride
in
my
backpack.
While
my
recollections
register
a
final
essay
on
the
camera
whose
entire
substance
(and
length
for
that
matter)
equated
to
an
outline
of
the
background
information
section
of
a
future
college-level
research
paper,
my
fifth
grade
teacher
suggested
that
I
submit
it
to
the
writing
competition
through
which
NThe
MermaidOs
TailO
had
been
recognized.
I,
however,
believed
that
the
judges
would
find
my
fact-driven
essay
on
cameras
unimpressive
compared
to
the
other
entries,
and
I
submitted
my
short
story
on
garden
fairies
instead.
Twenty-six
pages
of
the
comings
and
goings
of
a
large
family
of
fairies
with
assorted
flower
names,
this
was
my
true
pride
and
joy
of
fifth
grade.
Each
time
I
completed
a
page,
I
circled
the
freshly-finished
page
number
and
added
the
sheet
of
lined
notebook
paper
to
a
growing
pile
on
the
corner
of
my
desk.
Fourteen
years
later,
I
cannot
accurately
recount
any
of
the
character
names,
the
details
of
the
setting,
or
the
general
plot.
Fortunately,
it
did
not
take
me
fourteen
years
to
become
aware
of
the
vast
difference
between
conciseness
and
verbosity.
Though
I
still
struggle
with
run-on
sentences
and
wordy
papers,
I
have
begun
the
process
of
recognizing
importance
and
the
unmistakable
value
of
the
writing
process:
the
numerous
benefits
of
multiple
drafts,
the
rewards
of
a
detailed
discussion
of
a
work,
and
the
satisfaction
and
pride
of
handing
in
a
completed,
fully-reviewed
work
to
another
person
(usually
an
educator
of
some
sort).
Like
passing
the
relay
baton
off
to
the
next
runner,
knowing
that
what
I
have
written
represents
the
very
best
effort
I
could
present
to
another
person
to
read,
digest,
and
interpret
from
the
hand-off
point
is
one
of
the
greatest
mixtures
of
relief
and
excitement.
This
lesson
struck
me
rather
instantaneously
at
the
end
of
fifth
grade,
when
the
other
girl
who
had
submitted
her
research
paper
on
volcanoes
took
home
the
writing
award
certificate.
Her
paper,
not
unlike
mine
on
the
history
and
structure
of
the
camera,
had
endured
a
rigorous
process
of
notecards,
outlines,
drafts,
and
peer-editing,
whereas
the
magic
of
my
fairy
saga
had
appeared
solely
before
my
eyes.
I
have
always
strived
to
please
other
people.
I
now
perceive
this
character
trait
as
a
bit
of
a
flaw,
as,
in
the
instance
of
my
day-to-day
routine,
it
possesses
the
potential
of
costing
me
my
sense
of
individualism
and
dignity.
In
the
written
realm,
however,
it
buys
me
much
of
my
external
motivation
and
(frequently)
purchases
the
excitement
I
(usually)
experience
before
receiving
the
baton
for
the
final
time,
a
finished
paper,
read,
commented
upon,
and
evaluated
by
a
person
of
higher
education
than
myself.
I
do
not
mean
that
writing
to
impress
another
reader
is
my
only
motivator
and
goal
when
I
sit
down
at
my
computer
or
notebook.
Rather,
I
look
forward
to
reading
the
recorded
reactions
of
another
reader,
so
that
I
can
learn
from
the
criticisms
and
recycle
the
favored
writing
strategies
in
future
papers.
My
first
distinct
encounter
with
meaningful
feedback
occurred
in
sixth
grade,
when
my
English
teacher
handed
back
my
first
major
research
paper
for
the
class.
She
had
assigned
us
a
controversial
issue
for
which
we
had
to
take
a
stand;
I
researched
and
composed
a
paper
on
the
importance
of
protecting
the
wetlands.
Through
this
initial
lesson
in
persuasive
writing,
I
learned
how
to
harness
the
energy
of
passion
about
a
topic
and
transform
it
into
a
piece
intended
to
better
inform
and
potentially
change
the
mind
of
another
reader.
I
learned
how
to
structure
an
essay
so
that
it
attracts
attention
from
the
first
sentence,
fully
supports
its
thesis
throughout,
and
ends
(like
any
good
movie
or
book)
with
the
reader
not
only
craving
more,
but
also
considering
its
importance
after
setting
aside
the
physical
paper.
I
learned
to
concede
and
refute,
to
anticipate
doubts
and
wield
them
as
weapons
for
my
cause.
I
learned
to
expect
detailed
comments
and
even
personal
discussions
about
a
work
with
truly
devoted
English
teachers.
Finally,
I
learned
to
take
my
essays
seriously,
because
my
teacher
had
done
just
that.
During
our
conference
she
informed
me
that
she
had
brought
my
paper
home
for
her
husband
to
read
because
he
too
harbored
an
interest
in
the
disappearing
wetlands.
So
from
the
process
of
completing
this
essay,
I
also
learned
about
the
power
that
one
piece
of
writing
holds
as
an
idea,
before
it
is
even
composed
of
sentences
to
influence,
to
inspire,
and
to
induce
change.
As
part
of
the
Humanities
program
offered
at
my
high
school,
I
was
taught
by
the
quality,
writing-identity-shaping
English
teachers
that
seventh
and
eighth
grade
had
not
offered.
I
practiced
structure
in
the
ninth
grade,
through
the
use
of
multiple
outlines.
Though
I
found
them
repetitive
and
tedious
to
complete,
they
ingrained
the
general
essay
format
(hook,
thesis,
areas
of
support,
intro
sentence
for
first
area
of
support,
integrated
quote,
analysis,
integrated
quote,
analysis,
integrated
quote,
analysis,
concluding
sentence,
and
on
and
on
until
I
finally
hit
the
concluding
paragraph)
into
my
mind
forever,
so
that
when
I
was
called
upon
to
write
with
more
sophistication
and
variety,
I
felt
comfortable
enough
with
the
basic
idea
of
an
essay
to
stray
from
the
structured
outline
and
sculpt
my
own
form
to
better
address
the
task
at
hand.
Four
years
of
high
school
English
classes
taught
me
several
important
lessons
about
my
personal
writing
style.
Specifically,
redundancy
bothers
me.
So,
in
order
to
remedy
the
frequent
use
of
certain
transition
words,
I
created
a
mental
list
of
several
that
could
serve
as
replacements
for
words
such
as
Nfor
exampleO
and
NshowsO.
I
admit
that
I
find
it
hard
to
ignore
repetition
of
those
two
phrases
when
I
read
other
papers,
and
I
used
to
write
other
possibilities
in
the
margins
in
order
to
equip
the
writer
with
his
or
her
own
toolbox
of
terms.
Yet
I
have
begun
to
realize
that
this
eagerness
to
mark-up
papers
blurs
the
unique
identity
that
separates
the
work
of
one
writer
from
another.
After
learning
from
a
Lafayette
English
professor
that
each
author
writes
with
a
certain
voice
and
that
readers
well-versed
in
an
authorOs
work
can
identify
the
author
through
his
or
her
writing
style,
I
no
longer
felt
compelled
to
correct
such
minor
errors
because
in
doing
so
I
disguise
the
authorOs
true
distinctiveness
with
my
own.
Instead,
I
strive
to
ask
general
questions
about
the
content
of
the
work
so
that
the
author
may
answer
them
in
his
or
her
own
voice.
I
have
also
developed
a
preference
for
quality
analysis
over
quantity
of
quotes.
While
both
partners
of
the
pair
are
certainly
important,
I
find
myself
able
to
dissect
smaller
units
of
a
quote,
such
as
a
significant
adjectiveOs
relationship
to
its
respective
noun
separately,
rather
than
attempting
to
solve
the
whole
quote
in
a
sentence
or
two.
This
technique
does
strengthen
my
wordy
tendency,
though,
and
I
try
to
return
to
the
drafts
to
trim
my
sentences.
In
one
memorable
case,
I
composed
an
essay
assigned
by
my
twelfth
grade
English
teacher
that
was
two
or
three
pages
over
the
limit.
I
found
the
topic
very
interesting
and,
since
writing
has
always
come
more
easily
to
me
than
speaking
in
front
of
large
groups,
I
imprinted
on
the
pages
everything
that
I
did
not
say
in
class.
I
worried
about
the
number
of
pages
though,
as
I
did
not
want
to
anger
my
teacher
or
resurrect
my
fifth
grade
catastrophe.
The
night
before
the
due
date,
I
saved
the
original
and
cut
everything
I
could
and
(in
many
cases)
could
not
bare
to
cut
out
of
a
copy.
I
brought
the
two
printed
versions
of
the
essay
to
class
and
asked
him
which
he
would
prefer.
After
the
slightest
hesitation
(at
such
an
odd
question
I
presume)
he
declared
that
he
would
like
the
shorter
version,
which
I
handed
off
to
him.
Cutting
out
so
much
of
an
essay
for
which
I
truly
held
so
much
pride
was
one
of
the
hardest
points
in
my
writing
career.
And
while
I
may
have
regretted
that
my
teacher
did
not
have
the
chance
to
read
about
some
of
my
findings
at
the
time,
I
believe
that
we
both
would
hold
the
same
positions
that
we
do
today
had
he
read
the
extra
three
pages.
I
admit,
however,
that
I
try
to
avoid
that
situation
whenever
possible,
through
peer
editing.
At
my
high
school,
I
became
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
writing
center,
where
I
befriended
one
of
the
most
intelligent
women
I
have
ever
known.
I
would
watch
as
she
read
my
paper
with
a
distinct
rhythm,
her
head
and
pencil
in
sync
as
if
she
were
tapping
out
the
syllables
of
my
sentences.
She
did
not
read
for
grammar
or
punctuation,
though
if
a
glaring
error
could
not
be
ignored,
she
would
make
a
notation.
Her
strategy
mandated
an
entire
read-through
of
the
paper,
with
periodic
markings
in
the
margins
to
signal
a
trouble
spot
that
would
need
attention
upon
the
second
read.
In
this
way,
the
editing
mirrored
the
holistic
concept
that
the
paper
should
ultimately
convey.
We
would
discuss
our
thoughts
in
all
stages
of
the
process
D
mine
as
the
initiator
and
the
writer,
and
hers
as
the
reader
so
that
both
of
us
were
usually
satisfied
with
the
future
of
the
essay
by
the
end
of
the
session.
I
benefited
from
these
meetings
immensely
and
I
quickly
came
to
realize
how
much
I
looked
forward
to
meeting
with
her.
She
represented
dependability
D
someone
I
could
always
count
on
to
read
my
papers
and
tell
me
truthfully
where
I
needed
to
improve.
Which
brings
me
(finally)
to
the
most
recent
past
and
fast
approaching
future:
writing
in
college
and
the
College
Writing
Program.
Fortunately,
I
felt
well
prepared
by
my
previous
years
of
schooling
so
that
I
did
not
have
to
worry
about
format
or
the
overall
effort
needed
to
write
a
satisfying
essay.
College
writing,
as
a
concept
however,
signifies
a
higher
level
of
commitment
and
depth
in
writing
than
my
earlier
efforts.
In
my
First
Year
Seminar,
I
learned
about
the
importance
of
detailed
documentation
of
sources
and
their
facts.
I
learned
how
to
succinctly
but
accurately
and
uniquely
summarize
proven
information
and
then
use
it
in
a
novel
way.
Through
numerous
Film
Studies
papers
I
experienced
first
hand
the
relationship
between
a
fact
and
itOs
role
in
the
whole
setting,
just
like
the
film
elements
I
so
thoroughly
analyzed.
My
French
classes
demanded
comparisons
between
different
mediums
such
as
film
and
written
excerpts
in
a
different
language,
which,
although
daunting
at
first,
turned
out
to
parallel
English
essays
D
the
essay
structure
now
a
seemingly
universal
language.
And
through
much
practice
in
Literary
Questions,
I
find
myself
more
aware
and
critical
of
my
own
work
and
of
the
work
others
place
before
me
to
read,
a
new
trait
that
I
hope
can
help
me
to
be
a
better
editor.
College,
even
in
my
day-to-day
life,
has
taught
me
more
than
I
could
have
ever
expected.
Being
surrounded
by
peers
and
professors
every
day
fosters
so
much
discussion
that
sitting
down
to
talk
about
a
class
and
a
paper
related
to
that
class
feels
like
an
extension
of
a
lunchtime
conversation,
or
a
casual
chat
after
class.
The
sheer
number
of
essays
I
wrote
last
year
alone
astounds
me,
especially
since
every
one
I
wrote
demanded
a
commitment
to
quality,
a
shifted,
unexplored
perspective,
and
a
piece
of
me.
I
hope
to
sharpen
my
short
history
as
a
writer
so
that
I
can
serve
as
an
approachable
and
dependable
editor
who
can
relate
to
the
experiences
of
incoming
freshmen,
helping
them
through
the
initial
challenge
of
an
assignment
and
the
many
trips
to
the
printers
at
Skillman.
I
cannot
wait
to
pass
on
my
baton,
which
has
felt
the
hands
of
so
many
editors
and
has
reflected
the
light
of
so
many
lonely
bulbs
of
late-night
changes
and
finalizations,
to
my
fellow
Lafayette
students
as
a
Writing
Associate.
