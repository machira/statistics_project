SCHOOL.
It
seemed
easy
to
think
about,
write
about,
and
analyze
my
reading
and
writing
experiences
throughout
my
life.
It
all
began
with
my
little
chalkboard
and
the
words
above
at
age
four.
My
skills
and
habits
developed
and
improved
(hopefully)
over
the
next
several
years.
Through
elementary,
junior
high,
and
high
school,
there
was
a
string
of
language
arts
and
English
classes,
some
better
than
others,
but
all
that
required
some
degree
of
writing.
In
second
grade,
we
were
given
a
topic
and
told
to
write
a
one
page
creative
story
with
an
illustration.
(Even
then
it
was
clear
the
writing
would
be
easier.)
In
high
school,
it
was
more
often
a
research
paper
that
required
sources,
proper
documentation,
and
other
tedious
details.
I
wrote
book
reports
in
the
earlier
years
that
turned
into
essays
later
when
I
learned
that
what
one
writes
should
have
a
clear
point.
The
thought
of
writing
a
book
report
today
as
we
all
knew
it
then
is
just
silly;
there
is
more
to
reading
a
book
than
noting
the
author,
illustrator,
main
characters,
the
action,
and
what
your
opinion
of
the
book
was.
The
essay,
in
fact,
may
be
just
an
advanced
book
report.
However,
there
is
a
clear
dividing
line
between
the
two.
It's
easy
to
chronicle
your
progressions
in
reading
and
writing
when
the
line
is
that
divisive.
It
becomes
more
difficult
when
that
line
is
not
so
easily
defined.
The
developments
and
improvements
on
makes
at
this
stage
in
education,
college,
are
not
always
so
obvious
and,
consequently,
are
more
difficult
to
understand
and
explain.
Overall,
I
see
a
difference
in
my
writing
from
my
first
college
paper
to
one
I
might
write
today
under
similar
guidelines.
Beyond
the
first
few
weeks
of
freshman
year,
however,
I
can't
really
pinpoint
what
changed
when
and
why.
I
had
English
classes
that
required
well
thought
out,
peer-edited,
five
draft
papers,
and
other
classes
that
required
a
one
draft
quick
paper
to
achieve
the
same
results.
At
the
same
time,
I
had
science
classes
that
followed
an
entirely
different
set
of
guidelines
when
it
came
to
writing
a
successful
lab
report.
While
each
individual
situation
may
be
distinct,
I
think
each
affects
the
others,
and
the
level,
skill,
and
type
of
writing
I
know
how
to
do
is
really
a
constantly
changing
balance
between
any
type
of
writing,
or
reading,
with
which
I
come
in
contact.
It's
interesting
to
note
that
reading
actually
plays
a
large
part
in
my
writing
style.
I
suppose
it
always
has.
I
used
to
copy
every
word
of
a
short
children's
book
onto
my
own
paper
to
show
I
knew
how
to
write.
Later,
I
noticed
how
others
wrote
when
we
exchanged
papers
in
school
or
how
an
author
wrote
a
certain
novel.
I
knew
how
my
friends
would
be
writing
their
papers
in
high
school
after
we
sat
and
discussed
the
assignment
and
ideas.
What
I
don't
think
is
that
I
realized
how
much
that
reading
directly
affected
my
own
writing.
In
my
last
two
years
as
a
WA,
especially
this
past
one,
I
think
I've
discovered
exactly
that.
I,
myself,
have
not
had
the
most
exciting
writing
experiences
in
the
recent
year.
I
turned
in
plenty
of
lab
reports
and
am
learning
how
to
write
a
scientific
paper
if
there
is
any
hope
of
getting
it
published.
It's
not
quite
the
same
format
as
typical
paper
for
an
English
class.
So,
instead
of
much
writing,
my
experiences
this
past
year
have
focused
far
more
on
the
reading
and
WA-ing
of
others
writing.
As
a
WA
and
TA
first
semester
I
met
about
forty
new
freshmen
and
had
the
opportunity
to
see
how
their
writing
experiences
prepared
them
for
college.
In
the
second
semester,
it
was
a
group
of
sophomores
who
agonized
over
their
professor's
assignments
and
a
group
of
upperclassmen
who
cranked
out
the
lab
reports
I
assigned
with
no
problem.
The
differences
I
couldn't
see
in
my
own
writing
was
evident
in
the
differences
between
some
of
the
freshmen
and
sophomores
in
these
classes.
First
semester,
I
was
assigned
to
a
professor
who
did
not
push
the
"WA
system",
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
challenge
to
get
the
students'
response
without
the
professors
support.
It
made
me
work
harder
to
actually
do
the
job
I
thought
others
were
doing
far
better
in
their
own
classes.
Some
WAs
complained
because
they
had
to
meet
with
their
students
so
many
times
or
because
the
professor
changed
the
assignment
or
due
date
without
informing
them;
I
was
disappointed
because
my
professor
found
no
need
to
let
me
schedule
appointments
with
his
students.
With
the
exception
of
a
few
students
who
took
my
offer
and
sought
me
out
when
an
assignment
was
given,
I
met
with
almost
all
of
them
one
time,
in
the
few
days
before
their
final
twenty
page
research
paper
was
due.
At
that
stage,
it
was
awfully
difficult
to
point
out
the
lack
of
a
thesis
to
a
student
who
had
spent
hours
typing
out
twenty
pages
of
description
without
a
point
to
make.
I
must
admit
that
I
would
have
had
very
little
motivation
to
undertake
a
major
paper
overhaul
and
revision
at
that
time.
How
did
I
expect
them
to?
I
must
also
admit
that
I
learned
a
lot
about
WAing
from
that
class.
I
thought
if
I
could
go
back
and
start
the
semester
over,
the
outcome
could
be
far
more
successful.
While
I
couldn't
redo
first
semester,
I
was
lucky
enough
to
get
a
similar
opportunity
in
the
spring.
My
professor
then
was
also
not
what
one
might
call
the
biggest
advocate
of
the
WA
system.
The
one
thing
that
saved
me
and
allowed
me
to
improve
on
my
lacking
WA
work
of
the
first
semester
was
that
I
mentioned
to
him
the
first
time
we
met
that
he
should
make
it
clear
the
students
were
actually
supposed
to
make
appointments
and
even
keep
them.
He
did,
although
he
then
found
it
sensible
to
neither
pass
around
the
sign
up
sheets
I
dropped
off
(or
not
leave
for
me
the
sign
up
sheets
when
they
were
completed),
collect
the
papers
from
the
class,
inform
the
class
and
me
of
the
same
due
date
for
an
assignment,
and
other
such
things.
(I
guess
I
didn't
make
those
points
obvious?!?!)
While
this
may
have
been
a
recipe
for
disaster,
I
took
advantage
of
what
I
had
learned
from
the
previous
semester,
and
the
class
and
WA
experience
turned
out
to
be
excellent.
Now,
I
realize
most
students
only
came
to
the
first
conferences
because
five
points
of
their
grade
depended
on
it;
however,
no
one
told
them
to
call
me
two
more
times,
or
ask
to
meet
with
me
twice
to
brainstorm
or
go
over
a
specific
problem.
I
even
made
time
available
for
a
group
sort
of
meeting
when
one
assignment
was
particularly
confusing
-
especially
to
me!
-
and
we
just
sat
and
tried
to
come
to
some
conclusions
on
what
exactly
the
professor
was
looking
for
in
their
final
drafts.
I
know
I
was
not
required
to
meet
extra
times
or
go
out
of
my
way
to
meet
with
students
who
hadn't
completed
a
draft
by
their
scheduled
appointment.
I
found,
however,
that
it
was
far
more
useful
to
them
to
work
with
schedules
and
trust
they
were
not
taking
advantage
of
me.
As
it
turned
out,
I
did
not
have
a
single
problem
with
canceled
appointments,
papers
not
turned
in,
or
with
anything.
I
feel
like
I
have
a
better
grasp
this
year
on
how
to
work
with
both
the
students
and
a
professor.
In
addition
to
this,
it
was
useful
to
me
to
see
the
students
own
writing
style
and
process.
Instead
of
simply
seeing
a
final
first
draft
and
not
knowing
whether
a
student
spent
four
days
or
four
hours
on
a
paper,
I
had
a
good
idea
at
which
point
they
stood
in
the
writing
process.
Not
only
did
this
help
me
to
help
them
but
I
was
more
conscious
of
my
own
writing
process
and
style
in
the
few
papers
I
did
write
last
year
as
I
followed
them
through
theirs.
I
had
the
opportunity
to
see
how
fifteen
or
so
different
people
attacked
the
same
writing
assignment.
That's
not
an
opportunity
we
usually
have
in
our
own
classes,
regardless
of
how
much
peer
editing
is
done.
Overall,
I
feel
that
I
definitely
improved
as
a
WA
last
year.
The
professor
I
WA'd
for
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
was
excellent
at
the
time.
She
supported
the
program
and
the
WAs,
distributed
sign-up
sheets,
collected
papers,
gave
me
adequate
time
to
meet
with
students,
and
made
it
clear
that
keeping
appointments
was
required.
It
was
a
good
introduction
to
the
program.
My
second
semester
as
a
WA
forced
me
to
take
control
when
that
organization
and
commitment
was
not
handed
to
me
on
a
silver
platter.
All
I
can
say
about
that
semester
was
that
it
was
a
learning
process
.
..
and
lucky
for
me,
I
got
to
take
advantage
of
my
newfound
knowledge
and
assertiveness
soon
after
in
what
turned
out
to
be
an
excellent
semester.
Now,
not
only
do
I
feel
prepared
to
deal
with
any
circumstances
thrown
in
front
of
me,
but
I
can
take
what
I
saw
in
the
students
writing
and
particularly
their
individual
writing
processes
and
use
it
in
the
writing
I
will
be
doing
in
my
final
year
of
college
and
beyond.
I'm
taking
my
first
English
classes
in
two
years
and
will
probably
be
grateful
for
whatever
help
they
may
have
offered
me.
