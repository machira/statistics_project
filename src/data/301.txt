A
WRITER'S
PASSION
When
I
think
back
over
the
years
that
I
have
spent
writing,
I
discover
that
those
moments
of
my
writing
life
that
I
remember
most
vividly
all
have
something
in
common.
This
commonality
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
grade
received
or
even
the
praise
or
criticisms
garnered
by
a
piece
of
writing.
Quite
the
opposite--that
special
characteristic
linking
these
memorable
moments
is
passion.
I
have
written
hundreds
of
pages
over
the
course
of
my
life,
some
for
school,
others
for
my
own
pleasure.
Through
it
all,
a
passion
for
the
subject
of
my
work
is
what
sets
apart
my
favorite
writings
from
those
that
were
done
only
because
I
had
to
do
them.
I
would
also
venture
to
say
that
the
relative
quality
of
those
works
for
which
I
have
felt
true
passion
is
significantly
higher
than
those
for
which
I
have
not.
Having
found
the
tie
that
binds
together
the
high
points
of
my
writing
history,
it
is
time
to
ask
the
logical
question:
what,
exactly,
impassions
me
when
I
write?
The
obvious
answer
to
this
question
is
that
I
am
impassioned
when
I
am
free
to
choose
what
I
want
to
write
about
and
how
I
want
to
write
about
it.
This,
of
course,
refers
to
my
own
creative
writing.
I
much
prefer
creative
writing
to
the
structured
assignments
that
are
so
often
given
in
school.
I
find
it
confining
and
bothersome
to
be
given
an
assignment
that
says,
"Discuss
the
differences
between
the
mitochondria
of
cells
X,
Y,
and
Z,"
or
some
similar
narrow
topic.
Unless
I
am
an
avid
biologist
with
a
special
focus
on
the
internal
workings
of
the
cell--and
I
am
not--such
an
assignment
holds
absolutely
no
excitement
or
interest
for
me.
I
will
write
the
paper,
but
only
because
if
I
do
not,
my
grade
will
be
hurt.
This
is
not
an
assignment
that
I
would
ever
choose
to
undertake
on
my
own.
When
I
undertake
creative
writing,
however,
I
am
not
bound
by
a
limiting
paper
topic;
I
am
free
to
explore
and
create
whatever
worlds
I
want,
whatever
characters
I
want.
There
are
no
limits.
And
I
am
able
to
write
using
whatever
style
I
wish.
I
can
use
as
many
stylistic
fragments
as
I
want
and
not
worry
about
being
chided
or
marked
down.
Freedom.
AMihhhh,
what
a
wonderful
thing.
It
should
come
as
no
small
surprise,
then,
that
I
choose
to
focus
much
of
my
literary
history
on
my
creative
writing.
Indeed,
were
I
not
to,
I
would
more
than
likely
have
no
passion
for
writing
this
narrative,
and
instead
of
producing
what
I
hope
is
a
lively,
entertaining,
and
informative
document,
I
would
be
subjecting
my
poor
reader
to
a
boring,
repetitive,
and
sterile
dissertation
on
how
cell
X
really
does
have
superior
mitochondria.
I
shall
begin
by
hearkening
back
to
the
dawn
of
my
writing
career.
My
very
first
memories
of
writing
come
at
what
I
would
roughly
place
as
the
beginning
of
my
elementary
school
career.
I
was
a
young
child
fascinated
with
fantasy
tales
and
stories
of
adventure.
And
at
this
tender
age
I
had
also
acquired
a
deeply
abiding
love
of
J.R.R
Tolkien
and
his
epic
fantasy
trilogy
Lord
of
the
Rings.
At
this
point
in
my
life,
I
was
still
a
tad
too
young
to
read
Tolkien's
books,
so
I
instead
watched
two
cartoon
movies
that
had
been
made
some
years
ago.
What
I
saw
fascinated
me--elves,
dwarves,
wizards,
ores,
magic
rings,
dragons,
grand
adventure.
I
set
out
to
create
my
own
adventure
story,
so
I
began
writing
a
story
about
a
group
of
human
warriors
that
were
journeying
into
a
cave
and
fighting
their
way
through
the
humanoid,
pig-like
ores
that
guarded
it.
Not
only
did
I
work
on
writing
this
story,
but
I
took
on
the
additional
role
of
illustrator
and
gave
visual
life
to
the
tale
I
was
crafting.
I
must
fast
forward
a
few
years
to
reach
my
next
memorable
writing
experience.
This
time,
as
some
may
be
glad
to
hear,
I
am
remembering
a
school
assignment.
I
was
in
the
fifth
grade,
and
my
class
had
just
read
The
Westing
Game,
a
delightful
mystery
that
was,
at
the
time
I
read
it,
quite
a
difficult
book
for
my
age.
The
class
had
split
up
into
groups
to
read
the
book,
and
we
were
directed
in
our
groups
to
write
a
report
about
it.
My
group
approached
the
teacher
and
asked
if
we
could
write
our
own
mystery
instead
of
writing
the
report.
The
teacher
seemed
very
pleased
with
the
idea,
and
my
group
set
out
to
craft
a
tale
of
mystery
that
was,
we
hoped,
at
least
nearly
as
clever
as
The
Westing
Game.
Alas,
we
ran
short
on
time
and
money--well,
time
at
least--and
were
not
able
to
create
the
visionary
work
that
we
had
imagined
at
the
outset.
We
did
succeed,
however,
in
writing
a
neat
little
mystery,
the
climax
of
which
revolved
around
the
fact
that
Chinese
teacups
have
no
handles.
The
next
year,
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
have
as
my
teacher
Mrs.
Paresky,
a
wonderful
woman
who
was
always
smiling,
always
friendly,
and
always
encouraging.
In
her
class,
I
began
to
build
upon
the
foundations
of
my
elementary
school
experience
to
create
more
significant
and
more
memorable
pieces
of
writing.
The
piece
I
remember
best
was
based
on
a
charming
book
called
Aliens
for
Breakfast
that
I
had
just
read.
From
the
outset,
I
set
up
my
work
like
a
book.
I
began
writing
Chapter
1,
and
when
I
had
finished,
I
gave
it
to
my
teacher.
She
loved
it,
and
was
so
excited
by
it
that
she
published
it
in
a
literary
magazine
she
printed
up
for
our
class.
I
was
beyond
ecstatic.
My
classmates,
even
those
who
didn't
hang
around
with
me
much,
gave
me
compliments
and
suggestions
about
it.
I
was
so
proud
of
what
I
had
done.
Chapter
2
and
Chapter
3
soon
followed,
and
both
of
these
were
also
given
to
my
teacher.
Writing
three
chapters
was
about
all
I
could
handle
in
sixth
grade,
however,
and
after
beginning
Chapter
4,
my
book
soon
languished
and
was
eventually
forgotten.
I
would
begin
a
new
story
next
year
for
the
journal
we
were
required
to
keep
in
our
seventh
grade
English
class.
This
story
was
based
on
the
series
of
books
I
was
then
reading,
the
Pern
series,
by
Anne
McCaffrey.
As
of
this
point
in
my
writing
career,
I
was
still
basing
my
creative
writing
directly
on
books
or
movies
that
I
had
seen
and
that
had
captured
my
fancy.
The
Pern
series
is
a
futuristic
series
about
men
and
dragons
that
have
learned
to
coexist
on
a
far-off
planet.
My
story
was
set
along
similar
lines.
Indeed,
it
was
almost
like
another
episode
in
the
Pern
series.
This
journal
was
shown
to
very
few
people.
I
don't
even
remember
if
my
parents
saw
it
or
not.
I
continued
writing
this
story
for
the
whole
school
year,
but
when
the
year
was
over
and
I
was
no
longer
required
to
write
a
certain
number
of
pages
in
my
journal
each
month,
this
story
also
languished
and
was
never
again
worked
on.
When
I
think
back
to
eighth
and
ninth
grade,
I
am
beginning
to
have
memories
of
noncreative
writing.
I
have
to
say
that
upon
reflection,
my
essays
and
papers
produced
in
these
years
were
quite
primitive
compared
to
the
level
of
sophistication
I
had
achieved
in
my
creative
writing
at
that
same
age.
Perhaps
the
unbridled
freedom
of
creative
writing
had
freed
my
mind
and
allowed
it
to
advance
and
grow
much
faster
than
it
could
in
a
confined
classroom
context.
This
is
something
that
I
still
feel
is
true
today.
I
feel
that
I
am
at
my
best
when
I
am
exercising
my
creative
writing
skills.
My
analytical
and
argumentative
writing
was
quickly
growing
and
improving,
however,
even
though
I
didn't
enjoy
it
nearly
as
much
as
my
creative
writing.
In
ninth
grade
we
had
to
write
a
2000-3000
word
essay--at
the
time
a
very
great
amount--about
The
Mosquito
Coast.
I
received
one
of
three
A's
in
a
class
of
perhaps
twenty,
which
certainly
made
me
happy
and
proud.
It
was
a
different
sort
of
pride,
though,
than
the
pride
I
had
felt
when
I
was
complimented
on
my
creative
stories.
This
new
pride
was
the
sort
of
pride
I
take
in
my
schoolwork,
in
getting
good
grades.
The
pride
I
felt
with
my
creative
writing
was
a
more
of
a
pride
in
an
artistic
creation,
a
pride
in
this
story
that
I
myself
had
conceived
and
created
from
the
beginning.
I
believe
that
this
highlights
a
fundamental
difference
in
how
I
view
creative
writing
versus
how
I
view
assigned
writing.
Creative
writing
is
something
fun,
something
that
I
undertake
on
my
own,
for
my
own
pleasure.
Assigned
writing
is
work,
and
even
if
the
subject
is
one
that
does
interest
me
to
some
degree,
it
still
always
feels
like
work.
There
is
a
deadline
to
meet,
there
is
a
grade
that
will
be
received.
And
the
mere
production
of
the
paper
is
work;
I
must
revise,
edit,
proofread,
revise
again.
The
words
are
slower
to
come.
On
the
other
hand,
when
I
am
engaged
in
creative
writing,
the
words
flow
out
of
me
so
fast
that
I
sometimes
cannot
type
fast
enough
to
keep
up
with
my
brain.
And
when
I
go
back
to
edit
and
revise,
it
feels
like
play,
and
not
work.
Perhaps
this
is
why
I
so
enjoy
creative
writing.
My
preference
for
creative
writing
notwithstanding,
I
feel
that
I
am
still
a
very
good
academic
writer.
When
I
look
back
on
my
writing
career,
I
believe
that
much
of
my
writing
success
stems
from
my
experience
in
eleventh
grade
with
my
honors
English
teacher,
Mr.
Hazzard.
Mr.
Hazzard
is
one
of
the
most
passionate
and
dedicated
people
I
have
ever
met.
He
taught
me
that
I
could
experience
the
flame
of
passion
not
only
in
my
creative
writing
but
in
my
academic
writing
as
well.
This
flame
is
a
more
ephemeral
one
than
the
creative
writing
flame.
It
is
not
always
found
when
I
am
working
on
papers
for
class.
But
I
know
that
the
possibility
is
there,
especially
if
I
am
writing
about
something
that
especially
excites
or
interests
me,
that
I
will
experience
the
same
rush
of
power
and
flow
of
words
that
come
when
I
am
writing
adventure
stories.
This
happened
in
one
particular
instance
much
more
than
any
other.
The
assignment,
if
I
remember
correctly,
was
to
discuss
good
and
evil
in
William
Horwood's
novel
Duncton
Wood.
This
novel
follows
in
the
tradition
of
Watership
Down
and
chronicles
the
adventures
of
a
community
of
moles
as
they
live
their
lives
and
strive
for
love
and
goodness.
I
was
so
touched
by
the
power
and
the
beauty
of
the
book
that
I
wrote
a
massively
detailed
thirteen-page
essay
for
the
assignment.
This
was
at
least
fifty
percent
longer
than
any
other
essay
I
had
ever
produced
to
this
point.
I
certainly
don't
mean
to
imply
that
length
is
all-important,
but
I
believe
that
the
length
of
a
work
often
bears
testimony
to
the
level
of
interest
and
inspiration
behind
it.
Not
only
did
Mr.
Hazzard
help
me
find
my
academic
muse--or
at
least
teach
me
that
it
can
be
found--but
he
also
helped
me
improve
the
content
of
my
writing.
I
entered
eleventh
grade
feeling
that
I
was
a
very
good
writer,
but
it
only
took
one
or
two
essays
for
me
to
realize
that
I
still
had
much
to
learn.
Mr.
Hazzard
is
the
only
teacher
to
date
that
I
have
had
that
has
critiqued
the
content,
style,
organization,
and
transitions
of
an
essay
more
so
than
the
grammar
of
the
paper.
It
is
from
him
that
I
learned
how
to
write
an
introduction,
how
to
write
a
conclusion,
how
to
link
ideas
together
in
a
paper.
Mr.
Hazzard
taught
me
that
there
is
a
lot
more
to
writing
an
essay
than
an
introduction,
three
body
paragraphs,
and
a
conclusion.
I
believe
that
it
is
from
him
more
so
than
any
other
person
that
I
owe
my
subsequent
writing
successes.
I
also
believe
that
the
link
between
my
academic
writing
and
my
creative
writing
was
shown
more
clearly
in
my
junior
year
of
high
school
than
it
ever
has
been
before
or
since.
I
would
say
that
my
junior
year
is
the
first
year
that
I
began
to
produce
truly
high-quality
work
for
my
academic
writing
assignments.
Junior
year
is
also
the
year
that
I
began
what
is
my
largest
and
longest-running
creative
writing
venture
ever.
I
set
out
to
write
a
novel.
This
novel
is
not
based
on
any
one
particular
book,
like
my
earlier
works.
I
am
much
beyond
that
now.
Instead,
this
novel
is
a
creation
of
my
very
own
fantasy
world.
I
am
writing
my
very
own
fantasy
adventure
story,
one
which
I
hope
some
day
will
be
published.
I
have
been
working
on
this
novel
for
three
or
four
years
now,
and
I
am
happy
to
say
that
I
am
still
working
on
it.
I
have
not
put
it
down
and
cast
it
aside
like
my
earlier
works.
It
is
certainly
true
that
I
have
gone
through
periods
where
I
have
not
worked
on
it
for
a
fair
while,
but
I
invariably
pick
up
the
same
story
and
continue
right
where
I
left
off.
I
believe
that
the
full
blooming
of
my
academic
writing
and
this
full
blooming
of
my
creative
writing
are
intertwined.
They
feed
off
of
each
other.
The
additional
technical
and
stylistic
skills
gained
from
Mr.
Hazzard
have
made
my
creative
writing
even
better,
and
the
excitement
and
passion
of
my
creative
writing
has
helped
me
to
produce
more
interesting
and
powerful
academic
essays.
I
believe
that
by
eleventh
grade,
by
writing
had
reached
a
level
of
sophistication
where
I
no
longer
improved
in
leaps
and
bounds
such
as
were
accomplished
in
that
year.
Since
my
junior
year,
my
writing
has
gradually
matured
and
grown
to
become
what
it
is
now.
My
English
12
AP
class
in
particular
helped
provide
some
seasoning,
as
I
was
writing
for
a
very
particular
and
demanding
teacher.
Now
that
I
have
been
at
college,
I
feel
that
my
writing
has
continued
to
evolve
in
a
more
gradual
and
gentle
way.
The
most
noticeable
recent
change
in
my
writing
may
be
an
increase
in
verbosity.
I
have
noticed
that
I
have
very
little
trouble--comparatively
speaking,
of
course--producing
very
long
papers.
I
believe
this
is
very
much
a
product
of
what
I
have
settled
into
as
my
natural
style
of
writing:
I
prefer
to
write
in
an
intellectual
yet
casual
and
entertaining
manner.
I
will
frequently
phrase
sentences
in
such
as
manner
as
will
attempt
to
bring
a
smile
to
my
reader's
face.
Perhaps
this
conversational
tone
lends
itself
to
long-windedness.
I
am
not
sure.
At
any
rate,
this
is
currently
my
greatest
focus
with
my
writing.
When
I
write
papers
and
essays,
I
attempt
to
go
back
through
them
to
make
sure
that
I
have
not
been
overly
verbose
in
my
treatment
of
the
subject
matter.
I
must
confess
that
I
do
not
find
college
writing
to
be
any
different
or
any
more
difficult
than
the
writing
I
did
in
high
school.
In
fact,
I
would
say
that
the
essays
I
wrote
for
my
eleventh
and
twelfth
grade
teachers
were
the
most
demanding
essays
I
have
ever
written.
If
anything,
collegiate
writing
has
been
easier.
The
history
papers
I
have
done
here
at
Lafayette
have
been
my
most
interesting
collegiate
writing,
but
they
have
not
been
overly
difficult
for
me
to
write.
Any
difficulty
I
find
in
them
tends
to
be
self-applied,
as
I
seek
to
provide
an
extra-close
examination
of
an
issue
or
attempt
a
sweeping
analysis
of
an
historical
phenomenon.
I
find
my
history
papers
exciting,
however,
because
they
are
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
from
the
literary
analysis
I
was
growing
sick
of
in
my
English
classes.
I
am
minoring
in
European
history,
and
I
am
absolutely
fascinated
by
the
topic.
This
has
led
to
a
fusion
of
passion
with
my
academic
writing
that
has
helped
me
to
produce
detailed
and
interesting
work.
The
form
of
a
history
paper
is,
I
feel,
much
looser
than
the
form
of
an
English
paper,
and
within
this
framework
I
am
able
to
exercise
some
of
my
creativity.
The
ultimate
work--besides
my
novel--that
I
feel
I
have
produced
has
been
just
one
such
history
paper.
Each
semester
I
have
had
to
write
a
research
paper
for
my
history
class.
However,
the
topic
of
this
paper
is
not
assigned
by
the
professor;
rather,
each
student
picks
his
own
topic.
I
am
therefore
able
to
pick
topics
that
are
of
profound
interest
to
me.
The
second
semester
of
my
freshman
year
I
wrote
a
research
paper
that
was
a
military
history
of
the
Hundred
Years
War.
I
was
so
excited
and
impassioned
by
the
project
that
I
checked
a
dozen
books
out
of
the
library,
read
at
least
parts
of
all
of
them,
and
proceeded
to
write
a
sixty-four
page
paper
that
covered
most,
but
not
all,
of
the
major
issues
and
battles
I
wished
to
discuss.
The
actual
writing
of
the
paper
was
entirely
accomplished
in
a
three-day
period.
I
did
not
move
from
my
computer.
And
yet,
even
though
I
was
writing
for
perhaps
ten
or
twelve
hours
a
day,
I
have
never
had
so
much
fun
working
on
a
piece
of
academic
writing.
I
felt
like
I
was
playing
one
of
my
fantasy
adventure
computer
games.
The
fusion
of
passion,
creativity,
and
interest
has
always
led
me
to
produce
writing
that
is
of
the
highest
caliber.
It
is
an
elusive
combination,
one
that
I
would
say
I
have
only
truly
found
in
a
few
instances.
Writing
produced
without
it
can
vary
from
insufferably
boring
to
tolerable
to
even
slightly
enjoyable,
but
when
these
three
muses
have
been
discovered
and
brought
together
in
one
place
at
one
time,
writing
is
so
much
more.
It
is
a
dragon
spreading
its
wings
in
flight.
It
is
a
crystal
stream
winding
through
a
lush
and
verdant
valley.
It
is
a
gleaming
jewel
atop
a
king's
crown.
It
is
the
pounding
in
the
blood
at
love's
first
kiss.
It
is
the
fevered
rushing
and
blending
together
of
emotion
and
power
into
heartfelt,
triumphant
song.
Writing
is
all
this
and
more.
When
true
passion
is
brought
to
writing,
simple
words
on
a
page
become
the
very
heartbeat
of
the
human
soul.
