Writing
has
always
been
a
means
of
expression
and
exploration
in
my
life.
It
is
one
of
the
few
actions
that
has
continually
been
there
from
the
time
I
was
very
young
and
will
continue
to
be
there
until
the
day
I
die.
As
I
begin
to
look
back
at
my
very
first
memories
of
writing,
I
envision
my
first
grade
classroom.
I
remember
the
excitement
and
anticipation
of
learning
how
to
write.
However,
my
anticipation
immediately
dissolved
when
we
were
instructed
that
we
could
only
use
large
ugly
black
pencils
made
especially
for
small
hands.
I
was
extremely
disappointed
because
I
felt
it
differentiated
me
from
the
rest
of
the
known
world.
I
knew
I
was
extremely
capable
of
holding
a
skinny
yellow
pencil
just
like
my
father.
Nonetheless,
we
were
strictly
forbidden
from
writing
with
anything
other
than
these
large
obtuse
objects.
Everyday
we
had
to
write
sentences
with
these
unbearable
objects
we
referred
to
as
pencils.
I
even
hated
writing
the
sentences.
This
routine
continued
until
my
last
week
in
the
first
grade
when
I
finally
obtained
my
freedom.
Our
teacher
told
the
class
that
we
were
allowed
to
write
with
whatever
writing
utensil
we
saw
fit.
I
could
write
with
a
pencil,
pen,
marker,
crayon
or
whatever
other
writing
device
I
chose.
I
was
finally
free
to
explore
the
writing
world.
I
was
no
longer
confined
to
the
ugly
black
pencils
and
the
rote
sentences
every
morning.
My
mind
was
now
free
to
explore.
After
achieving
this
new
found
freedom
and
a
bit
more
experience
with
English,
I
stumbled
upon
what
I
thought
was
my
future.
I
was
determined
to
become
an
author
and
so
I
began
testing
my
hand
at
many
different
types
of
literature.
I
began
by
trying
to
be
a
poet
and,
although
I
mastered
Haiku,
I
became
very
frustrated
with
poetry.
It
seemed
to
be
too
confining
for
me.
Later
I
thought
that
I
could
write
children's
stories,
but
I
found
this
to
be
too
childish;
after
all,
I
was
eight
years
old.
Finally,
I
realized
that
my
writing
passion
was
for
novels.
I
began
to
write
about
fifteen
different
novels
before
I
abandoned
this
dream.
I
never
was
able
to
get
farther
than
a
few
pages.
The
story
always
seemed
to
end
after
I
had
written
one
event.
I
remember
sitting
in
my
living
room
with
a
stack
of
papers
on
the
table
and
a
pen
in
my
hand.
I
would
wear
eyeglass
frames
so
I
would
look
more
studious.
I
tried
to
imagine
what
a
real
author
would
do.
I
would
write
my
thoughts
on
a
page
until
I
was
disgusted
with
what
I
wrote.
I
would
then
crumble
the
paper
and
throw
it
onto
the
ground
until
I
was
swimming
in
wrinkled
papers.
I
felt
like
an
author
out
of
the
movies.
Finally,
a
brilliant
idea
would
come
to
me
and
I
would
scrawl
down
a
three-page
story.
With
the
elation
of
a
job
well
done,
I
would
run
to
my
parents
and
share
my
exciting
story.
They
were
always
very
supportive
and
encouraged
me
to
continue
writing.
As
I
grew
older,
my
writing
began
to
change.
I
no
longer
wanted
to
be
a
novelist,
but
I
did
not
want
to
stop
writing
stories.
I
would
frequently
write
for
myself
and
use
writing
as
an
expression
of
how
I
was
feeling.
I
would
write
many
stories
about
young
girls
and
the
struggles
that
they
faced
growing
up.
Writing
was
the
one
form
that
I
could
use
to
escape
any
of
the
troubles
that
I
was
facing.
Even
now
I
can
look
back
at
these
stories
and,
although
the
names
are
different,
I
can
easily
recognize
the
situations
that
were
happening
in
my
life.
At
this
point,
I
enjoyed
writing.
I
could
not
think
of
anything
better
to
do
than
to
record
everything
that
was
happening
around
me.
However,
as
I
grew
older
and
school
placed
more
demands
upon
my
writing,
I
began
to
loathe
it.
Once
high
school
came,
any
of
the
desire
to
do
creative
writing
was
squelched
with
the
need
for
academic
discourse.
My
writing
life
became
filled
with
lab
reports
and
research
papers.
I
no
longer
had
the
time
or
the
desire
to
write
for
myself.
My
freshman
year
English
course
concentrated
solely
upon
how
to
write
a
research
paper.
My
teacher
spent
weeks
ingraining
into
us
the
concept
of
a
thesis,
introductory
paragraph,
body
and
conclusion.
These
principles
would
become
the
four
commandments
of
my
writing
life.
Any
writing
I
did
through
high
school
followed
this
very
determined
pattern,
and
any
derivation
from
this
was
frowned
upon
and
immediately
corrected.
Nevertheless,
this
conditioning
did
nothing
to
prepare
me
for
what
I
faced
my
junior
year
of
high
school.
Suddenly
I
was
in
Argentina
and
desperately
trying
to
learn
not
only
to
speak
Spanish
but
also
to
write
it.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
could
not
express
myself
at
all;
even
writing
a
simple
note
was
virtually
impossible.
Any
intellectual
suave
that
I
may
have
had
in
English
had
vanished.
I
wrote
as
if
I
was
two
years
old
(supposing
a
two-year
old
could
write).
Nothing
made
any
sense.
I
can
remember
sitting
in
class
and
copying
notes
from
a
neighbor,
only
this
time
I
was
not
copying
the
words
nor
the
letters
but
simply
the
lines
on
the
page.
It
was
a
very
scary
experience
to
be
writing
something
that
I
could
not
even
understand.
With
time
and
patience,
I
learned
not
only
how
to
speak
Spanish
but
also
how
to
write
it.
By
the
end
of
my
junior
year,
I
was
able
to
take
my
own
notes
in
all
of
my
classes.
I
once
again
felt
independent
and
very
accomplished.
However;
this
feeling
quickly
disappeared
during
my
twelfth
grade
year,
when
I
returned
to
the
United
States
where
I
continued
to
write
in
the
same
mechanical
fashion
that
I
had
learned
in
high
school.
The
transition
from
high
school
to
college
brought
with
it
many
writing
fears
and
false
confidences.
As
I
entered
my
first
year
at
Lafayette
College,
I
was
convinced
that
my
writing
would
meet
every
expectation
that
any
professor
could
have
of
me;
after
all,
I
had
mastered
the
technique
taught
in
high
school.
For
my
first
paper
in
my
First
Year
Seminar,
I
ordered
my
thoughts
in
the
manner
that
I
had
always
done.
My
paper
was
returned
to
me
with
a
large
comment
written
in
the
top
corner.
The
professor
explained
that
he
had
expected
a
lot
more
from
me.
I
was
dumbfounded.
I
had
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
on
this
paper
and
I
felt
like
a
failure.
The
entire
semester
was
filled
with
bitterness
and
struggles.
I
could
not
understand
what
to
change
and,
as
far
as
I
knew,
I
had
the
elements
that
every
paper
needed.
Finally,
with
tear
filled
eyes
I
approached
my
professor
with
a
feeling
of
absolute
defeat.
My
third
and
final
paper
was
once
again
a
disappointment
to
him.
I
explained
my
frustration
at
not
knowing
what
to
do.
He
told
me
that
he
wanted
me
to
take
out
all
the
junk
.
He
said
that
he
did
not
want
a
thesis
statement
or
any
other
flowers
.
He
just
wanted
the
facts.
I
was
completely
shocked.
I
began
to
realize
that
writing
was
not
simply
research
papers
and
lab
reports.
Just
as
in
first
grade,
my
eyes
began
to
open
and
the
possibilities
began
to
show
themselves.
My
writing
also
began
to
change
in
another
way.
Throughout
high
school
and
college
I
had
become
accustomed
to
writing
using
a
computer.
However,
my
junior
year
of
college
I
was
once
again
faced
with
the
task
of
writing
with
a
pencil.
I
now
had
to
write
mathematical
proofs.
I
had
never
done
this
type
of
writing
before.
It
was
a
very
precise
form
of
writing,
which
in
many
ways
defied
many
of
the
principles
that
I
had
learned
in
my
English
classes.
Every
sentence
began
with
next
,
then
,
as
a
result
or
any
term
similar
to
these.
It
was
a
type
of
writing
meant
for
a
very
specific
group
of
people
mathematicians.
Any
remaining
flowers
in
my
writing
had
to
vanish.
Learning
how
to
write
proofs
was
very
tedious.
As
with
any
writing,
I
copied
the
styles
of
any
mathematician
I
encountered.
Professors
would
correct
me
and
then
I
would
try
something
new.
I
began
to
notice
that
as
my
proof
writing
evolved
there
was
also
a
change
in
my
other
forms
of
writing.
As
I
began
to
write
more
concise
proofs,
my
writing
outside
of
my
math
classes
also
became
more
concise.
I
never
imagined
how
changing
writing
in
one
portion
of
my
life
would
have
such
a
dramatic
impact
upon
the
other
areas
in
which
I
wrote.
This
summer
I
was
faced
with
my
latest
writing
challenge.
I
had
an
internship
with
an
insurance
company
and
I
had
to
learn
how
to
write
business
letters
and
memos.
After
learning
how
to
write
mathematical
proofs,
I
was
sure
that
there
were
no
extras
left
in
my
writing
and
that
I
wrote
as
clearly
as
I
ever
would.
Little
did
I
know
what
was
waiting
ahead.
This
summer
as
I
began
to
write
for
my
manager,
she
would
lecture
and
re-lecture
me
about
what
needed
to
be
said
as
quickly
and
concisely
as
possible.
She
would
say
that
there
is
no
need
to
say
something
in
three
sentences
what
could
be
said
just
as
easily
in
one.
As
I
wrote
for
her
this
summer,
I
was
able
to
get
a
glimpse
of
what
business
writing
was
like.
It
has
been
very
exciting
to
be
challenged
throughout
my
life
with
writing.
I
enjoyed
exploring
the
world
of
writing
when
I
was
younger
and
then
slowly
breaking
down
the
barriers
that
I
had
built
when
I
was
older.
As
a
young
girl
I
never
dreamed
that
my
writing
would
have
so
many
personalities.
Currently,
I
am
faced
with
a
new
challenge
of
being
a
Writing
Associate.
This
carries
with
it
many
fears,
yet
at
the
same
time
I
am
filled
with
the
anticipation
and
excitement
of
looking
at
the
world
of
writing
in
an
entirely
new
way.
