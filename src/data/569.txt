Everything
I
DidnOt
Know
about
My
Life
as
a
Writer
and
Never
Wanted
to
Ask
Before
I
address
the
question
at
hand,
I
have
to
admit
that
this
has
been
the
most
frustrating
paper
I
have
ever
been
assigned.
Considering
how
and
why
I
have
developed
as
a
NwriterO
seems
as
strange
to
me
as
contemplating
how
I
became
right-handed
or
why
I
sleep
on
my
side.
Just
as
trying
to
be
a
lefty
or
sleeping
on
my
back
would
be
unnatural,
living
without
writing
would
make
me
feel
in
some
way
less
comfortable,
less
myself.
Writing
just
feels
right;
I
have
rarely
wondered
why.
If
I
had
my
druthers
(and
if
I
did
not
have
to
fill
seven
pages),
I
would
leave
it
at
that.
However,
I
am
compelled
to
explore
at
least
some
of
the
gory,
biographical
details
and
attempt
to
piece
together
from
them
some
explanation
of
my
relationship
with
writing.
What
follows
is
the
written
equivalent
of
thinking
out
loud.
I
have
probably
been
doomed
to
write
since
birth
D
possibly
even
before.
Hours
of
reading
Dr.
Seuss
with
my
mother
and
watching
Star
Trek
and
Doctor
Who
with
my
father
instilled
in
me
a
love
of
stories
at
a
very
early
age.
Before
long,
I
was
spending
almost
all
of
my
time
making
up
sagas
that
expanded
to
include
my
Barbie
dolls,
my
stuffed
animals,
and
the
secret
lives
of
all
of
the
people
I
met
on
the
street.
Without
knowing
how
to
put
words
on
paper,
I
wrote
about
the
princess
who
hid
from
her
wicked
stepmother
by
waiting
tables
at
my
local
diner
and
about
the
reason
my
motherOs
car
always
looked
so
sad.
I
never
shared
these
stories
with
anyone
else.
I
felt
no
need
to
do
so.
All
I
wanted
from
the
mental
exercise
was
entertainment
and
the
thrill
of
creating
a
world
of
my
own.
That
intrinsic
rather
than
extrinsic
reasons
motivate
my
efforts
has
remained
important
to
me
ever
since
and
has
governed
my
experience
as
a
creative
writer.
Although
the
most
significant
tenet
of
my
approach
to
creative
writing
was
developed
at
an
early
age,
I
was
a
literary
late-bloomer.
In
early
elementary
school,
my
teachers
assigned
simple
writing
tasks
D
never
more
than
a
few
sentences
D
that
I
enjoyed
but
which
were
not
at
all
creative.
Because
I
was
taught
to
write
in
an
academic
setting
and
using
formulaic
exercises,
I
failed
to
connect
the
act
of
putting
words
on
paper
with
the
idea
that
those
words
could
come
not
from
a
workbook
but
from
my
imagination.
Until
I
was
taught
otherwise,
I
believed
that
writing
required
a
prompt
and,
although
I
continued
to
NwriteO
stories
in
my
head,
I
did
not
set
any
of
them
down
on
paper.
In
third
grade,
I
was
finally
introduced
to
the
concept
of
creative
writing
through
a
patriotic
poetry
contest
organized
in
celebration
of
some
special
event
that
escapes
my
memory.
My
entry,
a
clumsily
written
poem
about
Johnny
Appleseed,
won
first
place.
Although
I
appreciated
my
teachersO
and
parentsO
praise,
I
was
pleased
with
my
poem
mostly
because
it
was
mine.
I
felt
the
pride
of
a
craftsman
who
knows
the
hard
work
that
went
into
producing
a
pretty
thing,
and
that
feeling
meant
more
to
me
than
any
blue
ribbons
or
compliments
I
could
have
received.
Looking
back
on
the
poem
now,
I
realize
my
first
poem
is,
to
be
honest,
fairly
lousy,
but
I
appreciate
it
for
what
it
was:
a
beginning.
That
little
poem
and
the
confidence
its
modest
success
encouraged
me
to
write
more
and
to
be
more
willing
to
share
the
fruits
of
my
labor.
To
this
day,
I
like
when
other
people
acknowledge
that
I
have
done
a
good
job,
but
I
prefer
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
my
efforts
have
produced
worthy
results.
In
the
latter
years
of
grade
school,
I
began
to
keep
journals
and
to
experiment
with
writing
in
my
free
time.
I
read
as
many
books
as
I
could,
and
every
book
gave
me
new
ideas
to
put
on
paper.
As
a
fifth
grader,
I
created
fictional
characters
and
wrote
journals
about
their
doings,
both
the
mundane
and
the
fantastic.
When
I
was
in
sixth
grade,
I
decided
that
I
would
write
1,000
haiku
in
a
year.
I
read
The
Lord
of
the
Rings
in
seventh
grade
and
was
inspired
to
try
writing
in
Elvish.
Nobody
told
me
to
do
any
of
these
things.
I
just
wanted
to
see
if
I
could.
I
succeeded
at
everything
but
the
Elvish.
Although
I
wrote
prolifically
when
I
was
younger,
very
little
of
it
remains
because
very
little
of
it
was
committed
to
paper.
When
I
was
in
fourth
grade,
my
family
got
our
first
computer,
Frankenstein,
a
hodge-podge
of
parts
culled
from
old
machines
and
assembled
by
my
uncles,
two
mad
computer
geniuses
who
did
not
realize
that
their
gift
would
further
influence
how
I
write.
Before
Frank
arrived,
my
grandfather
used
to
allow
me
to
use
his
typewriter,
but
I
had
no
interest
in
it.
Typing
was
difficult
for
me,
and
I
liked
the
way
my
cheap
ballpoint
pens
would
leak,
covering
my
hands
in
ink
spots.
It
made
me
feel
like
a
real
writer.
However,
my
love
affair
with
cheap
Bic
biros
was
not
to
last.
The
first
time
I
realized
I
could
use
Frank
to
compose
stories
and
write
school
assignments,
I
fell
in
love
and
abandoned
pen
and
paper
almost
completely.
It
is
only
now
that
I
am
forced
to
think
about
it
that
I
understand
why.
I
do
not
prefer
computers
to
other
writing
media
because
they
have
cool
blinking
lights
and
helpful
animated
paperclips
that
check
my
spelling,
although
I
am
all
for
nifty
fonts.
I
like
computers
because
they
are
untrustworthy
and
tend
to
crash.
Since
I
rarely
show
my
non-academic
writing
to
anyone
because
I
do
not
particularly
crave
approval,
it
all
tends
to
sit
around
on
my
hard
drive
gathering
dust
until
the
inevitable
blue
screen
of
death
obliterates
it
all.
There
is
little
in
life
that
I
find
more
liberating
than
having
months
or
years
of
work
wiped
away
in
an
instant.
Nothing
beats
a
clean
slate.
My
creative
writing
continued
largely
uninterrupted
and
unobserved
by
outsiders
until
eighth
grade.
That
year
my
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Ford,*
decided
to
show
my
writing
to
the
world
regardless
of
my
very
vocal
protests.
In
addition
to
repeatedly
displaying
my
assignments
to
other
students
without
my
permission,
she
submitted
one
of
the
poems
I
wrote
for
her
class
to
be
judged
in
a
contest.
I
knew
nothing
about
it
until
Mrs.
Ford
announced
to
all
of
sixth
period
English
that
I
had
won
the
fabulous
first
prize:
the
chance
to
read
my
poem
in
front
of
almost
the
entire
populace
of
my
hometown
at
its
annual
Christmas
tree
lighting
ceremony.
This
was
a
significant
problem
for
me
for
two
reasons.
First,
I
did
not
want
to
stand
out
in
the
cold
and
read
a
poem
I
thought
was
mediocre
in
front
of
a
huge
crowd
who
in
all
probability
did
not
want
to
hear
it,
and
second,
my
poem
was
the
result
of
a
particularly
bad
habit
of
mine.
Because
I
was
easily
bored
and
frustrated
by
Ncreative
writingO
assignments
that
allowed
no
room
for
actual
imagination,
I
tended
to
resort
to
being
a
bit
of
a
wise
guy
in
order
to
maintain
interest
in
my
work.
In
recent
years,
I
have
become
a
more
disciplined
writer,
but
in
eighth
grade
I
had
yet
to
learn
much
self-control
in
this
respect.
For
months,
I
had
been
quietly
rebelling
against
Mrs.
Ford
by
writing
poems
and
stories
that
were
as
schmaltzy,
trite,
and
horrible
as
I
could
possibly
make
them.
Because
it
was
the
Christmas
of
2001,
the
poem
I
unwittingly
composed
for
the
contest
was
a
patriotic,
homespun
ode
to
America
at
Christmas
that
appeared
for
all
the
world
to
have
been
taken
from
a
greeting
card
or
the
caption
to
a
painting
by
Thomas
Kinkade.
In
reality,
it
was
as
full
of
dark
irony
as
an
eighth
grader
could
possibly
make
it,
which
is
not,
I
now
realize,
very
dark
at
all.
Although
I
was
confident
that
only
a
few
people
would
listen
closely
enough
to
realize
my
poem
was
as
insincere
as
possible,
I
was
still
uneasy.
However,
Mrs.
Ford
had
already
called
to
congratulate
my
parents,
so
I
could
not
refuse.
In
the
end,
I
read
the
poem
and
nobody
was
any
the
wiser
about
my
attitude
toward
my
schoolOs
creative
writing
program.
I
burned
every
copy
of
the
poem
I
could
find,
but
I
have
not
forgotten
that
violation
of
privacy
or
the
secret
thrill
of
getting
away
with
something.
As
a
result,
I
am
even
more
reticent
to
share
my
creative
work
with
others
and
even
more
prone
to
do
literary
mischief
when
I
can
get
away
with
it.
Despite
the
aforementioned
negative
experience,
I
look
back
on
my
childhood
as
a
time
when
I
began
to
have
fun
with
language.
It
was
during
this
period
that
I
developed
a
taste
for
wordplay.
In
late
elementary
school,
I
learned
about
puns.
I
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
understand
why
grown-ups
groan
whenever
I
made
one.
I
still
donOt.
For
my
part,
I
have
always
found
puns
hilarious.
My
friends
and
I
used
to
have
punning
contests
over
lunch
and
at
recess.
Although
we
grew
out
of
those
when
others
began
to
tease
us
for
being
nerds
enough
to
have
them
in
the
first
place,
they
instilled
in
me
a
hearty
respect
for
people
brave
enough,
quick-witted
enough,
and
fun-loving
enough
to
pun
openly.
Even
now,
my
favorite
authors
are
those
who
demonstrate
that,
although
language
is
serious
business,
it
is
also
a
fantastic
toy.
Formal
writing
was
not
a
large
part
of
elementary
and
middle
school.
A
few
basic
research
papers
and
a
persuasive
essay
every
now
and
then
was
more
or
less
the
extent
of
it
as
far
as
I
can
remember.
When
they
gave
any
sort
of
NseriousO
assignment,
my
teachers
always
walked
the
class
through
the
writing
process
in
baby
steps,
thereby
rendering
the
work
very
easy
and
terribly
dull.
In
high
school,
however,
I
was
forced
to
work
on
my
own
to
write
a
twenty
page
research
paper
every
year.
This
was
part
of
an
enrichment
program
dictated
by
something
called
an
IEP
that
meant
I
was
smart
enough
to
need
extra
work
but
not
smart
enough
to
get
out
of
doing
it.
Although
I
was
assigned
an
advisor,
I
had
free
reign
to
do
more
or
less
whatever
I
wanted
provided
the
paper
was
well-written,
accurately
researched,
and
was
submitted
on
time.
Although
it
sounded
like
a
drag
at
the
beginning,
writing
twenty
pages
on
a
subject
of
my
choice
turned
out
to
be
a
lot
of
fun.
I
preferred
the
freedom
and
independence
of
my
thesis
to
the
seemingly
oppressive
restrictions
of
normal
classroom
work.
I
also
enjoyed
doing
research,
learning
new
things,
and
sharing
them
with
others.
In
high
school,
my
teachers
played
key
roles
in
my
formation
as
a
writer.
Mrs.
April
NIs
the
Cruelest
MonthO
Zielinski
assigned
notoriously
difficult
work
in
her
AP
Language
and
Composition
course.
On
the
first
day
of
class,
she
announced
that
the
passive
voice
and
linking
verbs,
being
weak,
were
forbidden.
Then
she
assigned
a
twenty-five
page
term
paper.
I
have
never
been
more
proud
of
anything
than
I
was
D
and
still
am
D
of
my
twenty-seven
pages
of
exhaustively
researched
background
on
popular
perceptions
of
the
Beat
Generation.
Mr.
Newman,
a
pony-tailed
hippie-type
who
never
quite
made
it
out
of
1969,
taught
me
to
appreciate
Shakespeare,
Chaucer,
and
the
rest
of
the
classic
Ndead
white
guysO
on
my
own
terms.
The
canon
is
not,
I
learned,
perfect
or
unassailable.
A
work
of
great
literature
does
not
die
when
its
author
does;
it
changes
as
its
readers
change.
Sra.
Tcherviakova,
my
first
and
favorite
Spanish
teacher,
ushered
me
into
a
brand
new
world
of
literary
possibilities.
From
then
on,
I
dreamed
of
writing
and
reading
in
both
languages
and
of
bridging
the
gap
between
them
by
learning
to
translate
the
literature
I
love.
When
I
left
high
school,
I
felt
prepared
for
college
and
for
the
continuation
of
my
education
in
literature,
language,
and
writing.
I
knew
how
to
take
both
compliments
and
criticism
with
grace
and
to
learn
from
them.
At
the
same
time,
I
understood
myself
enough
to
realize
that
not
having
the
urge
to
display
my
NstuffO
and
not
having
confidence
in
my
abilities
are
different
things.
I
was
familiar
with
the
painstakingly
detailed
process
of
researching,
pre-writing,
outlining,
organizing,
drafting,
editing,
and
formatting
various
types
of
academic
writing
and
had
adapted
each
step
until
I
could
compose
a
research
paper
almost
as
comfortably
as
I
could
a
letter
to
a
friend.
On
my
computerOs
hard
drive,
I
built,
lost,
and
re-built
an
array
of
creative
works
ranging
from
my
abortive
sci-fi
comedy
novel
to
a
series
of
color-coded
love
poems.
Most
importantly,
I
had
integrated
into
the
formalities
of
more
serious
genres
the
love
of
play
that
had
colored
my
earliest
experiences
with
writing.
Looking
back
over
the
history
of
my
relationship
with
writing,
I
am
surprised
to
find
how
little
I
have
changed.
I
have
a
greater
arsenal
of
technical
skills
and
a
deeper
knowledge
of
the
structure
and
function
of
written
language,
but
deep
down
I
am
still
the
little
girl
who
writes
mostly
for
fun.
I
take
my
work
seriously,
but
my
motivation
is
still
strictly
intrinsic.
I
still
write
almost
everything
on
my
computer
and
take
secret
pleasure
in
erasing
my
hard
drive
and
starting
over.
Despite
my
education
in
more
serious
literary
forms,
I
still
think
limericks
and
puns
are
some
of
the
best
things
ever
written.
What
shocks
me
most,
however,
is
that
I
was
completely
unaware
of
all
of
these
important
factors
in
my
life
until
writing
this
essay
brought
them
to
my
attention.
It
is
only
at
this
moment,
as
I
sit
trying
to
write
this
paper,
that
I
realize
just
how
much
the
act
of
putting
words
in
order
means
to
me.
Yes,
we
actually
called
her
that
D
behind
her
back,
of
course.
