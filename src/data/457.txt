WA
essay
A
WriterOs
Confidence
The
first
writing
assignment
that
I
remember
completing
during
the
past
year
is
the
WA
reflection
piece
that
I
wrote
before
returning
to
Lafayette
for
my
sophomore
year.
Because
I
was
nervous
about
what
the
job
required
and
because
I
was
not
sure
how
this
piece
would
affect
my
status
within
the
program,
I
labored
over
this
assignment
for
weeks.
I
meticulously,
and
also
nervously,
read
and
reread
what
I
had
written,
making
sure
that
each
sentence
was
as
clear
as
I
could
make
it
and
that
the
overall
quality
of
the
work
was
of
highest
value.
I
did
this
mostly
because
I
felt
that
something
was
at
stake;
if
I
did
not
prove
the
quality
of
my
writing
with
this
first
assignment
I
may
not
be
asked
to
continue
working
as
a
WA,
which
was
a
job
I
had
hoped
to
have
since
the
beginning
of
my
freshman
year.
When
I
mailed
in
my
essay,
it
was
something
that
I
was
proud
and
confident
about.
I
could
hear
in
the
words
that
I
had
written
the
natural
flow
of
good
writing
and
I
felt
that
the
time
and
effort
that
I
put
into
it
was
shown
in
the
final
product.
But
when
I
arrived
on
campus
for
WA
training,
the
essays
were
given
little
direct
attention
and
other
students
talked
about
having
written
up
their
narratives
the
night
before.
Though
I
should
not
have,
I
felt
embarrassed
for
myself.
Why
had
I
taken
so
much
time
on
a
task
that
could
have
been
completed
much
quicker?
Why
had
I
worried
so
much
about
the
quality
of
my
essay?
Had
those
extra
hours
of
work
really
benefited
me
or
would
I
have
been
just
as
well
off
if
I
had
not
obsessed
over
my
first
WA
essay?
Judging
from
the
students
around
me,
I
could
have
easily
written
my
piece
within
a
few
hours
and
recorded
the
jist
of
what
my
history
as
a
writer
has
been.
It
was
not
until
a
few
months
later
that
I
came
upon
that
essay
while
I
was
cleaning
through
my
Word
documents
folder.
I
reread
the
narrative
with
much
pride.
I
remembered
how
silly
I
had
felt
in
having
spent
so
much
time
on
a
project
that
had
so
little
consequence
on
my
overall
job
as
a
WA
but
I
also
realized
how
valuable
the
assignment
had
been.
Because
of
the
effort
that
I
put
into
the
assignment,
I
made
many
realizations
about
my
writing
that
I
otherwise
would
not
have.
Mainly,
I
began
to
take
myself
seriously
as
a
writer.
I
had
always
been
a
person
who
wrote,
but
I
was
never
an
actual
writer.
Writer
implied
a
certain
authority
which
I
had
never
attributed
to
myself.
But
in
looking
back
over
my
career
in
writing
and
realizing
the
progress
that
I
had
made,
I
was
able
to
see
myself
in
a
new
light.
For
the
first
time,
I
began
to
think
of
myself
as
a
writer.
Drawing
up
my
writerOs
history
also
helped
me
to
develop
a
new
consciousness
about
my
writing.
I
was
asked
to
think
about
the
mistakes
the
I
had
made,
the
progress
that
I
had
achieved
and
the
place
where
I
currently
stood.
This
task
allowed
me
to
see
writing
as
a
process,
as
something
fluid
and
evolving.
This
helped
to
liberate
me
from
the
fear
that
I
often
faced
when
I
sat
down
in
front
of
my
computer
to
compose.
I
was
able
to
recognize
that
writing
constantly
presents
new
challenges
but
that
my
own
history
was
proof
that
these
challenges
can
be
overcome.
The
worst
case
scenario
was
that
I
would
have
to
write
a
few
bad
pieces
before
I
could
write
a
few
good
ones.
I
became
less
intent
on
writing
perfectly
the
first
time
and
became
much
more
open
to
revising
and
drafting
my
work.
With
a
new
frame
of
reference
and
a
new
attitude
about
the
value
of
my
writing,
I
entered
my
sophomore
year
with
confidence.
Thinking
about
writing
and
working
with
other
writers
helped
me
to
become
less
demanding
upon
myself.
I
began
to
read
my
work
in
the
same
way
that
I
read
the
essays
of
other
student
writers.
I
no
longer
expected
to
read
a
perfect
draft,
simply
because
such
a
draft
does
not
exist.
I
realized
that
each
version
is
an
approximation
of
a
set
of
ideas
that
the
writer
is
trying
to
communicate
and
there
are
infinite
ways
in
which
the
writer
can
compose
these
ideas.
The
job
of
the
writer
is
to
anticipate
the
version
which
will
best
communicate
with
her
reader.
Knowing
this,
and
seeing
the
process
in
motion,
helped
me
to
feel
less
intimidated
in
my
own
writing.
My
goal
when
I
sat
down
to
write
was
to
first
get
my
thoughts
down
on
paper
and
I
rested
with
the
assurance
that
I
could
always
go
back
and
change
what
I
had
written.
Suddenly,
my
writing
became
much
easier.
I
no
longer
procrastinated
as
much
and
I
found
myself
writing
more
and
more
often.
Writing
became
something
I
did
by
choice
rather
than
by
assignment.
Because
I
was
no
longer
intimidated
by
words,
they
became
a
mechanism
by
which
I
could
cope
with
and
understand
my
daily
world.
If
I
needed
a
break,
if
I
needed
piece
of
mind,
if
I
needed
to
rant,
I
would
go
to
my
computer.
I
had
always
been
surprised
to
hear
professional
authors
say
that
they
had
known
they
would
become
writers
simply
because
they
could
not
imagine
their
lives
without
writing.
Rarely
a
day
went
by
that
they
did
not
find
themselves
needing
to
write.
I
could
not
understand
this!
I
could
easily
get
by
without
writing
on
a
daily
basis.
But
the
easier
that
writing
became
and
the
more
enjoyable
that
it
felt,
I
began
to
understand
comments
like
these.
By
the
end
of
my
sophomore
year,
I
too
could
not
imagine
a
life
without
writing.
I
also
came
upon
one
of
the
biggest
challenges
I
have
yet
to
face
as
a
writer.
It
came
in
the
form
of
criticism
from
one
of
my
professors.
Throughout
my
education,
writing
had
always
been
a
strongpoint
for
me.
Though
I
was
intimidated
by
my
own
personal
standards
of
perfection,
I
had
never
been
directly
challenged
by
one
of
my
teachers.
Just
as
I
was
coming
into
my
own
as
a
writer,
I
had
a
professor
who
undermined
this
new
confidence.
After
turning
in
our
first
papers,
he
had
written
in
bold
across
the
top
of
my
front
page
NSEE
ME.O
I
could
not
think
of
anything
more
foreboding
and
could
not
imagine
what
he
had
wanted
to
Nsee
meO
about.
When
I
went
to
visit
him
in
his
office
later
that
week,
he
asked
me
to
consider
the
possibly
of
dropping
his
course.
He
was
not
sure
if
I
was
able
to
work
at
course
level.
My
paper,
he
said,
neglected
to
discuss
major
points
that
he
had
expected
in
the
essay
and
he
worried
that
because
I
did
not
include
them,
I
was
showing
a
lack
of
understanding
of
the
course
material.
I
was
so
surprised
at
these
comments
that
I
left
his
office
in
tears.
I
had
never
felt
this
sort
of
direct
challenge
to
my
academic
worth
before.
I
had
failed
multiple
choice
tests
before
and
received
less
than
satisfactory
grades
on
papers
but
there
was
always
the
possibility
of
studying
more
to
do
better.
But
what
my
professorOs
comments
suggested
to
me
was
that
I
was
not
capable
of
being
a
student
in
his
course.
It
was
not
a
matter
of
trying
harder
but
simply
a
lack
of
ability.
To
my
fragile
writerOs
confidence,
these
comments
came
as
a
severe
blow.
Young
writers
are
not
only
self-conscious
about
their
work,
but
also
very
protective.
And
to
have
my
skills
as
a
writer
questioned
by
an
authority
only
scared
me
into
believing
that
my
professor
was
right.
The
authority
that
I
had
felt
after
completing
my
writerOs
history
was
lost.
Once
again,
I
felt
the
same
fears
that
I
had
at
the
beginning
of
college
when
I
sat
down
at
my
computer
to
write
and
the
doubt
that
I
felt
about
my
writerOs
skills
had
returned.
This
same
professor
asked
me
to
rewrite
the
paper
and,
to
me,
this
task
stood
as
a
test
as
to
whether
or
not
I
would
be
able
to
continue
in
his
class.
On
a
larger
level,
it
was
a
test
to
my
skills
as
a
writer.
And
as
afraid
as
I
was
to
show
any
more
of
my
work
to
this
professor,
I
did
not
have
a
choice
but
to
retackle
the
assignment.
I
wracked
my
mind
trying
to
think
of
how
I
could
change
the
essay
in
front
of
me,
which
had
obviously
disappointed
him,
into
one
that
would
prove
my
worth
as
his
student.
I
was
never
more
self-conscious
than
at
that
moment
about
my
writing.
I
began
to
nervously
reread
what
I
had
written,
making
suggestions
to
myself
in
the
margins
as
to
what
changes
I
could
possibly
make,
and
slowly
my
pen
began
to
flow
again.
These
side-notes
became
ideas
for
new
arguments
and
I
was
able
to
rewrite
parts
of
the
paper
in
ways
I
hoped
would
improve
it.
I
do
not
remember
the
specifics
of
rewriting
that
paperNonly
that
I
knew
I
had
no
choice
but
to
make
some
serious
changes
and
that
there
was
no
guarantee
that
these
changes
would
suffice.
What
I
came
to
rely
on
in
this
fog
of
fear
was
my
experience
as
a
writer.
I
leaned
upon
sixteen
years
of
past
writing
and
used
the
challenge
the
professor
set
before
me
as
an
obstacle
that
I
had
no
choice
but
to
overcome.
To
write
about
it
now
makes
the
event
sound
overdramatic;
these
paragraphs
read
as
though
the
assignment
came
as
a
challenge
that
I
would
either
conquer
or
be
conquered
by.
And
as
biblical
as
these
terms
make
the
experience
out
to
be,
it
was
a
point
in
my
writing
career
that,
if
I
did
not
overcome
it,
I
probably
would
not
have
continued
believing
in
myself
as
a
writer.
This
is
because
writing
requires
a
leap
of
faith
and
also
a
bit
of
arrogance.
In
a
form
where
there
is
no
right
or
wrong
answers
it
is
difficult
to
know
what
the
true
value
of
oneOs
work
is.
To
go
by
other
peopleOs
opinions
is
not
always
the
best
route
to
finding
the
value
of
your
work,
but
only
listening
to
your
own
voice
is
highly
dangerous
as
well.
The
perfect
balance
is
to
listen
to
outside
criticisms
and
have
a
writerOs
intuition
that
knows
what
to
make
of
them.
Writers
need
confidence
and
experience
to
place
criticism
of
their
work
within
a
context
that
includes
their
own
voice
as
well
as
the
opinions
of
others.
This
way,
you
do
not
take
yourself,
or
any
other
editor,
too
seriously.
Unfortunately,
this
balance
is
difficult
to
strike.
It
is
hard
to
take
criticism
about
your
own
work,
especially
when
you
have
put
time,
effort,
and
a
piece
of
yourself
into
it.
The
criticisms
automatically
become
directed
towards
you,
not
just
your
work,
though
this
is
rarely
the
intention
of
the
editor.
Learning
to
distance
myself
from
my
work
was
one
lesson
that
I
was
given
this
past
semester.
And
I
also
learned
to
make
the
leap
of
faith
that
writing
requires.
I
had
to
work
in
spite
of
my
professor;
I
had
to
write
without
his
voice
echoing
through
my
ears.
This
task
was
made
all
the
more
difficult
knowing
that
he
would
be
the
one
to
eventually
read
the
paper.
The
strategy
that
I
ended
up
using
was
one
that
arose
out
of
the
assignment
that
I
wrote
about
earlierNmy
writerOs
history.
For
that
piece,
I
had
put
significant
effort
into
it,
not
for
a
grade
or
a
comment,
but
for
the
value
that
it
had
in
helping
me
realize
something
about
myself
and
about
the
world
that
I
live
in.
This
same
philosophy
guided
me
through
the
revision
of
my
rejected
paper.
If
I
closed
myself
off
from
criticism,
if
I
did
not
worry
so
much
as
to
how
I
might
achieve
a
grade,
but
more
about
putting
my
thought
into
the
paper
so
that
I
learned
something
from
the
product
that
I
was
creating,
then
it
would
inevitably
have
personal
value
regardless
of
what
material
(grade)
value
came
out
of
it.
The
paradox
of
writing
is
that
you
must
believe
that
you
are
a
good
writer
before
you
can
begin
to
write
well.
This
requires
a
healthy
dose
of
outside
encouragement
from
those
who
you
admire
but
it
also
needs
a
strong
internal
belief.
For
someone
like
myself
who
is
usually
more
shy
and
humble
than
she
is
proud,
writing
is
inherently
difficult.
My
natural
mode
is
to
sit
down
at
my
computer
and
think,
Nthis
is
difficult
and
I
have
a
challenge
in
front
of
me.O
The
mentality
of
a
good
writer
is
much
like
that
of
an
athlete,
who
feels
prepared
and
confident
about
the
task
in
front
of
her.
The
more
that
I
write
and
the
more
feedback
that
I
get,
the
more
I
am
able
to
adopt
the
athleteOs
attitude.
I
am
beginning
to
feel
as
though
writing
is
something
I
am
able
to
do,
and
with
a
little
convincing,
I
believe
that
I
can
do
it
well.
I
have
faced
the
first
of
what
is
probably
a
series
of
challenges
to
the
words
that
I
put
to
page,
but
I
am
also
learning
how
to
contextualize
these
criticismsNhow
to
learn
from
them
and
take
them
seriously
without
letting
them
convince
me
that
I
am
not
a
writer.
