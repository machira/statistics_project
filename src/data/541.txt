Returning
WA
Summer
Assignment
Professor
DeTora
Mix
Confidence
with
Experience
and
Stir
I
believe
that
successful
writing
is
achieved
when
the
writer
is
confident-
confident
that
she
understands
the
assignment,
the
guidelines,
the
deadlines,
the
type
of
piece
the
assignment
requires,
and
the
confidence
that
she
will
be
able
to
produce
such
a
piece
of
writing.
The
confidence
that
she
will
be
able
to
complete
the
assignment,
as
well
as
the
actual
success
of
the
paper,
comes
from
experience.
It
would
be
difficult
to
pin
point
the
specific
ways
my
writing
has
improved
over
the
past
two
years
that
I
have
been
a
WA,
and
exactly
what
points
in
time
I
made
these
improvements.
What
I
can
say,
is
that
reading
papers
from
all
different
levels
of
writers,
as
well
as
papers
in
a
different
language,
and
engaging
in
countless
discussions
about
writing
and
specific
papers
has
contributed
to
my
confidence
as
a
reader
and
a
writer.
This
confidence,
combined
with
the
experience
that
I
have
received
from
writing
intensive
classes
at
Lafayette,
has
enabled
me
to
grow
as
a
writer.
Surprisingly,
I
believe
that
I
learned
the
most
about
writing
and
being
a
WA
in
general
through
Waing
a
200
level
Spanish
class.
While
I
was
thrilled
to
be
given
the
opportunity
to
WA
a
Spanish
class-
I
was
nervous
that
I
was
not
qualified
or
prepared
to
take
on
such
a
task.
I
felt
a
little
how
I
did
when
I
Waed
my
first
class
the
year
before-
I
lacked
the
confidence
that
I
should
be
in
the
position
to
be
helping
others
with
their
writing.
Waing
a
Spanish
class
helped
me
realize
that
no
matter
the
topic
or
language
of
a
piece,
there
are
certain
elements
and
processes
that
need
to
go
into
a
paper
in
order
for
it
to
be
considered
a
success.
Although
I
came
across
different
obstacles
being
a
WA
for
a
Spanish
class
rather
than
and
English
class,
every
situation
was
comparable
to
something
I
had
dealt
with
as
a
WA
for
an
English
class.
The
biggest
challenge
I
faced
was
focusing
on
the
actual
writing
as
it
pertained
to
the
assignment-not
grammatical,
translation
errors
(lower
orders
of
concern).
Once
I
was
able
to
find
a
balance
between
the
two-
I
was
able
to
have
discussions
with
students
about
how
writing
an
essay
in
Spanish
is
almost
exactly
the
same
as
writing
it
in
English.
I
discussed
with
the
students
different
techniques
they
used
for
writing
an
essay
and
how
these
processes
could
be
applied
to
their
Spanish
assignments
as
well.
Although
this
is
something
I
have
always
told
myself
when
writing
for
a
Spanish
class,
I
did
not
start
to
truly
believe
it
until
after
working
with
these
students
on
their
papers.
The
two
main
problems
students
in
my
Spanish
class
faced
were
that
they
lacked
the
confidence
to
write
an
essay
in
Spanish,
as
well
as
the
experience
of
writing
more
than
a
short
response
or
page
long
essay.
The
lack
of
confidence
led
to
problems
with
the
content,
style,
length,
grammar
and
even
led
some
students
to
go
as
far
as
plug
an
essay
written
in
English
into
an
online
translator-which
is
considered
plagiarism
in
the
Language
department.
When
I
used
to
look
at
assignments,
the
number
of
pages
require
stood
out
very
bold
for
me.
Especially
in
Spanish
classes,
it
always
made
me
nervous
that
the
professor
knew
almost
exactly
how
many
pages
I
would
need
to
complete
an
assignment.
This
was
an
issue
a
lot
of
my
Spanish
class
students
faced-
they
were
so
worried
about
getting
the
right
number
of
pages
filled-
they
spent
less
time
actually
focusing
on
what
ideas
and
words
they
were
using
to
fill
the
space.
This
produced
stylistic
and
content
problems.
When
too
much
effort
is
put
into
length-
the
content
as
well
as
the
style
suffers-
and
ideas
can
become
repetitive
and
weak.
I
think
that
issues
such
as
length
are
given
more
focus
when
the
student
lacks
confidence
and
experience.
None
of
the
students
in
the
class
had
ever
written
an
actual
paper
in
Spanish-
and
doubted
that
they
even
knew
enough
words
in
Spanish
to
fill
up
the
3-5
required
pages.
As
the
year
progressed
however-
their
papers
improved.
Most
importantly,
what
I
learned
from
Waing
the
Spanish
class
is
how
important
it
is
to
understand
not
only
the
assignment,
but
also
the
material
that
the
assignment
is
based
on.
When
I
look
at
assignments-
no
matter
how
straightforward
they
might
seem,
I
always
read
them
over
several
times.
I
will
underline
and
highlight
where
I
see
necessary.
I
have
also
made
it
a
habit
to
talk
with
my
professors
about
assignments-
even
if
I
donOt
have
an
specific
questions
or
problems.
Through
discussion
I
have
often
found
that
I
do
have
doubts
or
ideas
that
need
clarification.
Understanding
the
material
is
a
process
that
involves
keeping
up
with
homework,
actively
participating
in
class,
and
speaking
with
the
professor
when
necessary.
Any
doubt
about
material
or
an
assignment
is
relative
and
important
to
the
success
of
the
paper.
What
I
have
learned
from
both
the
classes
I
have
Wa-ed
as
well
as
the
my
own
writing
is
that
the
content
of
the
paper,
no
matter
how
well
it
is
written,
is
an
essential
ingredient
for
a
successful
piece.
A
lot
of
my
students
in
the
past
have
said
to
me,
IOm
just
not
naturally
a
good
writer.
I
am
still
not
sure
if
I
think
that
there
are
natural
and
non
natural
writers-
but
I
do
believe
that
everyone
has
an
equal
shot
at
producing
a
solid
essay
or
paper.
In
addition
to
logical
sequencing,
varied
sentence
structure,
and
appropriate
vocabulary-
the
backbone
of
a
successful
piece
of
writing
is
the
content.
With
out
the
content,
none
of
the
other
elements
we
as
WAOs
consider
higher
orders
of
concern
matter.
That
is
why
understanding
the
material
that
we
write
about
is
so
important.
I
agree
with
the
WA
principle
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
read
the
course
material
to
help
students
with
their
writings.
The
students
I
have
WAOed
in
the
past
have
all
been
surprised
that
I
was
not
an
informed
reader-
because
they
did
not
understand
that
I
was
not
there
focus
on
their
argument
or
content,
but
rather
their
style.
But
what
I
realized
while
WA
ing
my
Spanish
class
is
that
without
accurate
or
strong
content-
the
paper
is
compromised.
This
happens
in
other
classes,
but
many
of
my
students
had
not
understood
the
story
they
had
read,
or
even
the
assignment
(because
it
was
in
Spanish).
While
there
was
a
lot
to
talk
about
style
wise-
it
was
hard
to
focus
my
attention
away
from
the
content
which
I
knew
was
inaccurate/did
not
make
any
sense.
This
also
happened
to
me
while
WAing
an
anthropology
class
in
which
several
different
students
defined
a
method
from
their
book
differently
than
the
professor
had
explained
it
to
me.
I
have
also
found,
that
whether
or
not
I
have
read
the
course
material,
or
know
if
a
students
content
is
accurate,
engaging
her
in
a
discussion
about
her
specific
work
helps
her
to
realize
if
the
content
is
or
is
not
accurate.
When
I
am
having
a
content
issue
with
a
piece
of
my
own
writing,
I
find
it
is
easiest
to
speak
with
an
uninformed
reader
about
my
ideas
and
interpretations
to
see
if
they
appear
logical.
Speaking
about
things
in
general
helps
me
understand
them-
which
I
think
is
true
for
many
things.
I
also
think
it
is
why
I
try
to
focus
my
WA
conferences
on
speaking
about
the
writing-
instead
of
looking
at
the
paper
and
going
through
it.
While
in
situations
where
the
material
or
assignment
was
misinterpreted
I
was
able
to
give
general
instruction
about
writing
a
solid
paper,
and
engage
the
student
in
conversation
about
her
writing-
my
time
working
on
the
specific
paper
was
not
always
productive
in
that
the
paper
would
have
to
be
re
written
before
handed
in,
not
simply
revised.
What
ended
up
happening
with
these
students
was
that
they
requested
a
second
conference
with
me-
after
they
had
spoke
to
their
professor
about
the
assignment/material.
Although
I
did
have
to
spend
extra
time
with
these
students,
I
was
able
to
learn
from
their
mistakes
and
save
time
working
on
my
own
writing.
Although
I
have
always
given
special
attention
to
my
writing
style,
I
have
come
to
learn
that
the
content
of
the
paper
is
equally
as
important.
This
seems
like
an
obviously
conclusion,
however
without
having
read
so
many
pieces
that
contain
underdeveloped
or
inaccurate
content,
I
would
not
have
seen
truly
how
much
a
piece
can
suffer
without
out
the
proper
substance.
Getting
the
content
right
also
leads
into
other
stylistic
areas
that
I
tend
to
focus
on
as
a
WA.
The
content
of
the
paper
might
suffer
because
of
poor
choice
or
words,
repetition,
failure
to
put
all
thoughts
into
the
actual
paper
or
express
ideas
accurately.
Good
content
can
lead
to
good
writing.
I
have
found
that
if
the
ideas
are
solid,
the
styles
is
more
likely
to
be
successful
as
well.
These
are
all
issues
I
focus
on
as
a
WA-
and
am
now
able
to
focus
on
in
my
own
writing.
This
is
also
why
I
feel
that
most
students
have
an
equal
chance
of
producing
a
successful
piece-
whether
they
are
naturally
OgoodO
writers
or
not.
To
grow
as
a
writer
I
think
it
is
also
important
to
grow
as
a
reader.
Peer
editing
was
given
a
lot
of
attention
through
out
my
history
as
a
writer.
I
have
always
loved
reading
other
papers
as
well
as
having
my
own
read.
To
be
a
good
WA
you
really
have
to
believe
in
this
process.
No
matter
how
good
I
think
a
piece
of
my
writing
is,
I
always
want
to
have
at
least
one
other
set
of
eyes
look
it
over.
As
a
senior,
with
my
experiences
as
a
WA,
as
well
as
my
classroom
experience,
I
believe
more
than
ever
in
the
peer
editing
process.
My
reader
does
not
have
to
be
someone
in
my
class,
who
has
the
same
ideas
as
me,
someone
who
I
consider
to
be
a
better
writer-
they
just
have
to
be
someone
who
can
read,
and
someone
who
is
honest.
As
a
paper
reader
I
try
to
be
as
honest
as
possible,
if
I
am
confused
and
need
clarification
I
will
say
so,
if
I
think
an
area
was
better
explained
out
loud
then
written
I
will
say
so.
I
believe
that
there
are
still
a
lot
of
improvements
I
need
to
make
in
my
own
writing-
even
as
a
senior
and
third
year
writing
associate.
While
I
think
that
my
creative
and
well
as
analytical
writing
has
improved,
I
still
struggle
with
assignments
that
require
me
to
draft
and
prove
my
own
thesis.
Specifically,
I
run
into
problems
when
I
am
asked
to
come
up
with
a
thesis
and
write
a
paper
on
an
issue
in
a
book
or
story.
I
have
difficult
coming
up
with
an
idea
that
is
considered
a
thesis-
and
the
support
I
need
to
prove
the
thesis.
This
seems
like
a
very
important
aspect
of
writing,
and
I
think
it
is.
I
lack
confidence
and
experience
in
this
area
which
is
why
I
was
able
to
deduce
that
confidence
and
experience
leads
to
successful
writing.
I
have
learned
a
lot
about
the
type
of
writing
that
I
think
I
am
bad
at
through
the
papers
I
have
read
Waing
as
well
as
the
professors
I
have
WAed
for.
I
am
now
more
confident
that
I
know
what
I
supposed
to
do
and
how
I
am
supposed
to
approach
such
assignments.
However
I
still
lack
the
other
significant
part
of
the
equation
which
is
experience.
Part
of
becoming
a
good
writer
is
getting
experience.
A
lot
of
people
who
consider
themselves
bad
writers
have
also
taken
every
opportunity
possible
to
avoid
classes
or
situations
where
they
are
forced
to
write-
and
this
only
makes
things
worse.
No
matter
how
much
how
frustrating
it
can
be,
I
know
its
important
that
I
try
to
gain
more
experience
writing
the
traditional
thesis
essays
because
it
will
help
me
become
a
stronger
writer,
as
well
as
reader,
overall.
