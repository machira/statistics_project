Literacy
Narrative
I
canOt
recall
a
time
when
I
have
not
preferred
reading
or
writing
over
solving
math
problems
or
conducting
a
laboratory
experiment.
As
a
child
I
was
an
avid
reader,
often
times
turning
a
flashlight
on
under
my
sheets
so
I
could
continue
to
read
after
my
mother
had
come
in
and
said
it
was
time
to
turn
the
light
off
and
go
to
bed.
I
believe
this
early
enjoyment
of
reading
enabled
me
to
build
the
strong
vocabulary
and
knowledge
of
grammar
that
allowed
me
to
become
a
confident
writer.
Other
than
tracing
dotted-line
letters
with
extra
fat
pencils
in
preschool,
I
have
no
clear
memory
of
learning
how
to
write,
or
of
my
first
compositions.
I
think
the
first
time
I
made
a
conscious
effort
to
write
something
original
was
when
I
started
attending
second
grade
at
a
new
elementary
school.
This
school
had
a
program
called
the
Eastover
Publishing
Center.
Students
from
every
grade,
kindergarten
through
fifth,
had
the
opportunity
to
write
stories,
autobiographies
or
short
reports
in
class
and
then
have
them
NpublishedO
in
the
Publishing
Center.
Located
in
a
corner
of
the
library,
the
Publishing
Center
was
staffed
by
studentsO
mothers
who
volunteered
their
time.
After
writing
something
in
class
you
took
it
over
to
the
Publishing
Center
where
you
had
to
read
it
to
one
of
the
moms
(to
make
sure
they
could
decipher
the
sometimes
creative
spelling)
who
then
typed
it
up.
Afterwards,
there
was
always
a
short
interview
conducted
to
gather
biographical
information
to
be
included
in
the
Nabout
the
authorO
page
at
the
end.
Finally,
students
got
to
pick
from
a
selection
of
fabrics
with
which
the
book
would
be
covered.
Several
days
later
a
nicely
bound
book
could
be
picked
up
at
the
Publishing
Center
and
taken
back
to
the
classroom
for
illustration.
This
experience
with
writing
was
very
positive
for
me;
for
a
while
I
even
wanted
to
become
an
author
when
I
grew
up.
The
Publishing
Center
made
writing
fun
and
rewarding,
because
you
got
a
great
end
product
to
show
for
your
work,
which
also
encouraged
students
to
take
their
writing
seriously.
I
certainly
never
produced
any
especially
impressive
writing
in
those
elementary
days,
but
it
helped
shape
my
attitude
towards
writing
in
general.
The
greatest
influences
on
my
writing
came
in
rapid
succession
throughout
my
middle
and
high
school
years.
In
seventh
and
eighth
grade,
my
history
teacher
was
a
dynamic
man
in
his
late
twenties,
Mr.
Hansberry.
He
and
I
immediately
hit
it
off
and
his
class
soon
became
one
that
I
looked
forward
to.
His
class
was
the
first
in
which
midterm
and
final
evaluations
were
given
largely
in
the
form
of
a
series
of
long
and
short
essays.
While
Mr.
Hansberry
was
always
positive
and
commended
my
writing,
he
recognized
aspects
of
it
which
needed
to
be
sharpened.
The
two
biggest
points
he
always
kept
after
me
about
where
detail
and
context.
He
explained
to
me
that
he
knew
I
studied,
paid
attention
and
participated
in
class
and
thus
had
a
firm
grasp
of
the
course
content,
much
of
which
came
across
in
the
essays.
However,
in
my
writing
I
tended
to
mention
only
the
big
conceptions,
which
of
course
are
important,
but
can
be
greatly
strengthened
by
use
of
specific
details.
This
made
sense
to
me
and
I
made
an
effort
to
include
relevant
details
in
my
writing.
This
is
still
something
I
am
working
on
today.
In
high
school
I
had
a
teacher
that
would
always
tell
me
Nshow,
donOt
tell,O
meaning
that
I
needed
to
give
specific
examples.
While
I
understand
the
need
for
detail,
it
is
still
something
that
I
have
to
think
about
and
work
hard
to
incorporate
into
my
writing.
Mr.
HansberryOs
second
main
observation
came
from
reading
my
journal
and
notes.
I
vividly
remember
reading
through
his
comments,
always
written
in
green
felt
pen,
and
seeing
NcontextO
underlined
twice,
on
many
of
my
pages.
At
first,
this
concept
was
a
little
hard
for
me
to
grasp,
but
I
eventually
got
it.
In
order
for
the
points
I
try
to
make
in
my
writing
to
be
relevant
and
meaningful,
they
must
be
written
within
a
clear
context.
I
later
connected
this
to
a
comment
that
a
Lafayette
professor
frequently
writes
on
studentsO
papers:
Ns.w,O
which
stands
for,
Nso
what?O
This
simply
means
that,
in
order
for
certain
details
and
anecdotes
to
be
properly
included
in
a
writing,
they
must
support
or
relate
to
something.
In
high
school,
I
had
the
great
fortune
of
having
two
excellent
English
teachers;
one
my
freshman
year
and
the
other
in
my
senior
year.
Mr.
Batty
was
one
of
those
teachers
that
everybody
loved.
As
well
as
teaching
all
levels
of
English,
he
coached
the
girlsO
track
team
and
boysO
varsity
basketball
and
was
a
comforting
combination
of
parent
and
friend.
The
greatest
thing
Mr.
Batty
did
for
me
as
a
writer
was
giving
me
confidence
and
pleasure
in
writing.
Up
to
this
point,
IOd
never
disliked
writing,
but
it
wasnOt
something
I
especially
enjoyed.
Each
week
in
freshman
English,
Mr.
Batty
assigned
the
class
a
topic
to
write
two
pages
on.
The
short
length
and
freedom
within
the
topic
was
what
I
think
made
the
writing
so
much
fun.
The
topics
themselves
were
things
that
I
liked
to
think
and
write
about:
your
favorite
or
secret
place,
a
special
family
or
holiday
tradition,
or
a
family
pet,
to
name
a
few
of
my
favorites.
This
was
writing
that
I
could
really
get
into
because
it
meant
something
to
me
on
a
personal
level.
Mr.
Batty
always
wrote
wonderful,
encouraging
comments
on
my
papers.
Looking
back,
IOm
not
sure
how
good
the
writing
actually
was,
but
at
that
time
of
my
life
as
a
writer
that
support
and
praise
was
what
I
believe
I
needed
in
order
to
have
confidence
and
take
pride
in
my
writing.
My
senior
year
I
took
AP
Literature
and
Composition
with
Mr.
Kennedy.
Mr.
Kennedy
was
one
of
those
teachers
known
for
being
tough,
but
good.
More
than
anything,
he
taught
me
how
to
analyze
literature
and
how
to
support
my
theses
with
evidence
from
the
literature.
In
addition
to
improving
my
analytical
writing,
Mr.
Kennedy
helped
me
become
a
more
aware
and
critical
reader.
As
all
good
teachers
do,
Mr.
Kennedy
challenged
me
and
would
not
accept
anything
less
than
my
best
work.
My
high
school
teachers
and
experiences
with
writing
prepared
me
well
for
the
writing
I
have
been
asked
to
do
at
Lafayette;
I
knew
how
to
formulate
a
thesis
and
support
it
through
research
and
writing.
Though
I
realize
there
is
always
room
for
improvement,
I
am
confident
in
my
ability
to
write
research
papers,
thesis-based
papers,
and
other
nonfiction
types
of
writing.
However,
I
am
not
nearly
as
comfortable
writing
nonfiction.
I
believe
there
are
two
main
reasons
for
this.
First,
I
have
never
considered
myself
an
especially
artistic
or
creative
person
and
as
such
I
have
a
difficult
time
creating
a
creative
and
original
work
of
nonfiction.
Second,
I
have
had
much
more
experience
writing
nonfiction
in
my
academic
career.
Perhaps
if
I
had
been
asked
to
write
as
much
fiction
as
nonfiction,
I
would
feel
equally
capable
of
both
types
of
writing.
It
could
also
be
that
I
am
overly
critical
of
my
own
fiction
writing;
somehow
it
just
never
seems
good
to
me.
I
occasionally
use
writing
as
a
therapeutic
outlet
in
the
form
of
journal
writing
or
poetry.
It
is
soothing
to
me
to
get
thoughts
onto
paper,
sometimes
it
seems
like
once
I
write
them
down
I
can
get
them
out
of
my
head
for
awhile.
This
writing
is
extremely
private
and
personal
to
me;
I
wouldnOt
even
let
my
best
friend
read
most
of
it.
Even
my
academic
writing,
though,
I
am
often
hesitant
to
let
other
people
read.
I
have
no
problem
handing
my
papers
over
to
WAs
and
professors
to
read,
but
I
have
never
been
one
to
readily
offer
up
my
paper
for
friends
and
family
to
read,
especially
not
before
the
final
draft
is
complete.
IOm
not
entirely
sure
why
this
is,
since
IOve
never
had
any
particularly
harsh
criticism
of
my
writing.
Being
more
comfortable
with
people
reading
my
work
is
something
I
am
trying
to
work
on
and
I
did
become
a
little
better
at
it
last
year.
It
wasnOt
until
middle
school
that
I
started
typing
papers
on
the
computer.
Prior
to
this,
all
of
my
work
had
been
done
with
paper
and
pencil.
In
elementary
school,
we
were
always
told
to
write
in
pencil
so
that
we
could
erase
errors
and
make
corrections
more
easily.
I
never
liked
this
because
I
prefer
to
use
a
pen
when
writing
simply
because
it
feels
better
to
me.
I
know
some
people
who
feel
ideas
flow
better
when
you
are
working
with
a
pen
and
paper
instead
of
typing
on
a
keyboard
and
others
who
feel
the
opposite
is
true.
Personally,
I
canOt
discern
a
drastic
difference
between
the
two,
but
if
I
am
doing
academic
writing,
I
prefer
to
do
it
on
the
computer
because
I
find
I
write
faster
and
more
freely
knowing
that
I
can
easily
make
changes.
For
example,
there
have
been
many
times
when
I
finish
a
paragraph,
reread
it,
and
decide
to
change
the
order
of
a
couple
sentences
or
even
place
the
entire
paragraph
in
another
part
of
the
paper
because
I
find
it
fits
better
there.
For
my
personal
writing,
however,
I
like
to
use
one
of
my
journals
and
a
nice
pen.
I
have
always
loved
stationary
shops;
I
could
spend
hours
and
hundreds
of
dollars
in
them.
Having
special
writing
tools
can
motivate
me
to
sit
down
and
write.
One
of
my
professors
last
year
asked
that
we
all
find
or
buy
a
NsexyO
pen
to
write
with.
A
regular
Bic
pen
would
not
do,
it
had
to
be
one
that
you
liked
the
look
and
the
feel
of.
I
immediately
knew
what
I
would
use;
for
my
high
school
graduation
present
my
grandma
gave
me
a
gorgeous
ballpoint
pen.
ItOs
a
light
golden
color,
which
my
grandma
said
reminded
her
of
my
hair,
and
has
a
nice
weight
and
smooth
feeling
to
it.
My
professor
said
that
writing
is
an
art,
and
just
as
you
need
a
good
brush
to
paint
well,
all
writers
should
have
a
good
pen
to
write
with.
IOd
never
thought
about
it
like
that
before,
but
I
do
realize
now
that
I
take
my
writing
more
seriously
and
enjoy
it
more
when
I
am
writing
with
a
sexy
pen.
One
of
my
greatest
struggles
with
writing
came
last
semester.
For
one
of
my
classes
I
had
to
write
a
20
page
research
paper.
It
wasnOt
really
the
writing
itself
that
I
found
difficult,
but
my
perceived
inability
to
conduct
research
and
come
up
with
something
to
write
that
was
original.
As
I
wrote
the
paper
I
felt
I
was
just
churning
out
the
research
I
had
done
in
new
words,
but
with
essentially
the
same
meaning.
I
went
in
to
discuss
this
with
my
professor
to
see
what
advice
he
might
have
to
offer.
To
my
relief,
he
said
that
as
an
undergraduate
student
writing
a
relatively
short
paper,
he
was
not
expecting
me
to
come
up
with
a
brand
new
and
earth-shattering
thesis
because
that
just
wasnOt
reasonable.
Rather,
the
project
was
meant
to
familiarize
me
with
a
certain
type
of
research
and
the
work
I
was
doing
could
later
become
the
basis
for
a
deeper
study,
perhaps
my
honors
thesis,
in
which
I
could
attempt
to
support
a
more
original
thesis.
One
of
the
best
things
about
writing
is
that,
no
matter
how
much
you
write
or
how
much
you
learn
about
writing,
you
can
always
improve
it.
I
know
there
will
never
come
a
time
when
I
can
say,
NWell,
I
think
IOve
become
the
best
writer
I
can
be.O
Although
I
get
frustrated
when
a
professor
doesnOt
like
my
writing
style
or
asks
me
to
make
significant
changes
in
a
paper,
I
know
this
is
how
I
improve
myself
as
a
writer.
For
me,
writing
is
frustrating
and
rewarding
almost
simultaneously.
I
have
stayed
up
late
countless
nights
struggling
to
finish
a
paper
when
all
I
want
to
do
is
give
up
and
go
to
bed.
In
the
morning
though,
when
that
paper
is
printed
and
stapled
and
ready
to
turn
in,
if
I
gave
it
my
all,
thatOs
a
great
feeling.
