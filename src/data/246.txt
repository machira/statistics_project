Year

Review:
1998-99
Block
of
Writing
August
27,
1999
Due
to
several
overlapping
priorities
and
looming
deadlines,
the
personal
satisfaction
I
had
once
received
in
my
writing
dropped.
Assignments
which
I
would
otherwise
enjoy
became
burdens
as
I
rushed
to
complete
them,
thereby
cutting
down
on
research
and
proofreading
time.
Although
no
less
prolific
than
previous
years,
I
printed
out
weaker
papers.
Coming
into
junior
year,
I
was
very
pleased
with
myself
to
have
been
published
in
Lafayette
College's
"VaST"
brochure.
My
essay,
I
am
told,
exemplifies
the
mix
of
scientific
jargon
and
ethical
discussion
that
the
class
hopes
to
elicit.
Funny,
I
never
remembered
putting
much
time
into
the
paper
(after
all,
it's
a
VaST
class),
and
upon
rereading
it,
I
realized
I
never
did
labor
over
it!
In
places,
there
were
syntax
errors
and
shaky
grammar
which
I
would
have
noticed
had
I
reread
it
before
submission;
even
the
arguments
have
some
questionable
conclusions.
I
did
not
like
my
own
essay--granted,
it
was
probably
a
first
draft
which
had
been
published.
Nevertheless,
I
determined
that
the
praise
was
not
over
a
good
paper,
but
rather
a
good-sounding
paper.
Therefore,
I
can
bang
the
keyboard
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
hand
in
a
"quality"
paper,
leaving
time
to
tackle
my
tough
biology
courses
and
to
study
for
my
post-graduate
admissions
test.
(Despite
this
initial
conviction,
track
competition
and
college
jobs
took
most
of
my
time--too
many
bloody
priorities.)
This
strategy
worked
well
for
laboratory
reports
and
biology
papers.
In
fact,
such
a
"keyboard-banging"
strategy
is
exactly
what
scientific
papers
require:
a
concise,
no
b.s.,
factual
description
with
no
creative
conclusion
and
lots
of
past
tense
that
would
make
an
English
professor
cringe.
However,
such
writing
began
to
spill
over
into
my
English
courses
as
well.
First
semester,
I
was
faced
with
the
"toughest
205
class"
offered.
Dr.
Westfall,
I
was
told,
is
a
harsh
grader
and
assigns
much
more
work
than
the
other
Literary
Questions
classes.
Perhaps,
but
her
high
standards
and
constant
barrage
of
assignments
kept
me
"in
the
class";
i.e.,
if
I
didn't
feel
there
was
work
to
do,
I
would
have
let
the
course
slip
as
a
"blow-off'.
I
put
in
a
lot
of
time
because
I
both
enjoyed
the
discussion
and
the
works
we
reviewed.
Still,
I
felt
I
got
away
with
weaker
writing
that
I
would
have
liked.
Ideas
and
editions
saved
me.
The
initial
draw
to
my
works,
and
the
resulting
good
marks,
come
from
the
thoughts
and
twists
I
give
in
analyzing
the
works.
For
instance,
I
"banged
out"
a
psychoanalysis
of
Sigmund
Freud's
character
in
The
White
Hotel.
The
writing
was
less
than
perfect,
but
the
ideas
and
the
attempt
to
tackle
a
tough
argument
had
merit.
However,
ideas
don't
take
much
time
to
develop--writing
them
does.
Luckily,
that
class
required
a
final
portfolio,
in
which
I
could
edit
my
lax
papers
to
a
slightly
better
quality.
Still,
I
knew
I
was
getting
away
with
something--with
taking
it
easy,
with
handing
in
papers
I
did
not
approve
myself.
Next
semester
brought
my
first
300
level
English
class,
Shakespeare.
Again,
I
was
intrigued
with
the
subject
and
class
discussion,
but
I
could
not
find
the
time
to
fully
develop
my
ideas
in
papers.
Dr.
Smith,
with
whom
I
had
worked
before,
noticed
the
change
and
brought
it
to
my
attention.
I
already
knew.
I
had
fallen
into
a
rut.
Mind
you,
a
writer's
rut
differs
from
a
writer's
block:
I
had
the
ideas,
but
I
developed
bad
habits
that
made
the
ideas
fade
in
an
array
of
poor
writing.
Dr.
Smith
worked
with
me
on
flow--perhaps
if
my
thoughts
had
better
transition,
my
papers
would
come
together.
Paper
to
paper,
nevertheless
found
myself
back
in
the
same
rut.
Delaying
my
assignments
(not
out
of
laziness,
but
the
opposite--I
was
doing
too
much!),
I
did
not
have
the
time
to
do
more
than
get
ideas
on
the
paper
in
a
meaningful
order.
At
a
300
level,
that
is
not
enough.
Again,
I
ended
up
with
decent
marks,
but
these
marks
were
based
on
effort
and
ideas,
not
on
excellent
writing--at
least,
not
by
my
standards.
No
matter.
"The
most
important
essay
of
my
life"
took
front
stage
to
any
dissatisfying
class
work.
During
the
latter
first
semester
and
throughout
the
second,
I
slowly
worked
on
a
paper
of
giant
proportions:
the
Association
of
American
Medical
Colleges
required
a
personal
statement
essay
which
would
serve
as
the
backbone
of
every
application--the
most
scrutinized
paper
of
my
career.
Doctors
from
Harvard,
Penn,
Johns
Hopkins
and
the
like
would
have
a
stack
of
essays--they'll
be
sick
of
reading
them--and
mine
had
to
stand
out,
I
had
to
look
like
I
deserved
to
be
at
medical
school.
The
requirements
were
simple:
one
page,
single
spaced.
I
would
be
thrilled
with
a
one-pager
in
any
of
my
courses,
but
this
assignment
was
all
too
important
to
bang
any
keyboard.
I
was
hoping
that
my
first
draft
would
need
only
minor
changes,
that
the
advising
professors
would
be
impressed
with
my
initial
attempt.
Fat
bloody
chance.
I
have
never
written
a
paper
which
had
to
be
so
concise,
so
loaded:
one
page
which
says
everything
about
me
and
why
I
want
to
be
a
doctor.
Likewise,
my
audience
came
largely
into
play.
Professors
who
are
not
easily
impressed
and
who
have
heard
it
all
before.
It
would
take
about
five
months
of
effort
to
get
this
right.
Still
saved
on
my
computer
are
about
30
drafts
of
my
personal
statement.
Like
a
game
of
grapevine,
"Sally
sells
sea
shells"
became
"How
much
wood
could
a
wood
chuck
chuck."
At
first,
the
tone
had
to
change.
I
sounded
haughty
and
upset
with
the
medical
profession.
A
few
simple
words
and
phrases
could
set
the
entire
tone
of
the
paper.
Next,
the
order
required
revision.
It
would
be
more
potent
if
my
academic
achievements
preceded
my
personal
afflictions.
This
new
order
required
another
change
of
tone,
something
more
professional
and
less
depressing
and
melodramatic.
More
order
revision
followed,
as
well
as
a
grammatical
refacing
to
make
the
paper
clearer.
Then,
I
had
to
find
some
way
to
minimize
word
repetition:
one
word
stated
twice
in
a
one
page
paper
might
demonstrate
a
lack
of
vocabulary.
(Actually,
it
shows
a
computer
without
a
thesaurus
function.)
As
the
paper
came
closer
to
completion,
the
revisions
became
easier.
I
enjoyed
writing
the
paper
as
I
had
once
enjoyed
putting
the
time
into
class
assignments.
I
believe
that
change
in
my
own
feelings
towards
the
paper
reflects
the
difference
between
my
writing
as
fun
versus
my
writing
as
work:
if
I
am
fully
confident,
fully
satisfied
with
the
work
I
am
"banging
out"
on
the
keyboard,
I
truly
delight
in
the
effort.
Finally,
about
a
month
into
the
summer,
I
happily
sent
away
my
personal
statement--with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
satisfaction.
This
painstaking
proofreading
and
revision
period
made
me
realize
the
huge
effort
that
must
go
into
a
near-perfect
paper.
More
importantly,
by
completing
this
essay,
I
have
freed
up
some
time
and
relieved
the
stress
involved
with
the
medical
school
application.
Therefore,
I
have
gained
some
confidence
that
I
can
complete,
with
satisfaction,
any
number
of
assignments
thrown
at
me
this
fall.
Likewise,
I
can
better
guide
my
peers
as
a
WA
since
I
have
further
developed
the
ability
to
read
a
paper
and
see
what
most
needs
to
be
revised.
Indeed,
it
took
the
toughest,
most
time-consuming
assignment
of
my
life,
but
I
feel
I
am
out
of
the
writer's
rut.
