An
Excess
of
Words
Since
the
dawn
of
my
academic
career
I
have
had
but
one
saving
grace.
For
much
of
my
life
there
has
existed
only
one
educational
stage
on
which
I
have
been
able
to
guarantee
success.
In
any
class,
at
any
institution,
I
have
relished
the
opportunity
to
perform
only
a
singular
assigned
responsibility:
the
oral
report.
I
have
always
like
describing
things.
One
day
however,
my
simple
love
for
words
spawned
many
more
complex
and
coherent
results.
My
parents
aside,
only
one
person
had
foreseen
this
inevitable
intellectual
development.
That
is
precisely
why
a
proud
and
amused
Mrs.
Rabitor
appeared
not
to
be
as
surprised
as
I
was
at
the
time.
In
the
midst
of
my
class's
voyage
through
the
wonderful
world
of
literary
terms,
we
were
asked
one
at
a
time
to
deliver
a
descriptive
statement
which
reflected
on
our
current
surroundings.
Wasting
no
time
and
in
fact
cutting
several
other
students
off
I
calmly
declared:
we
are
all
sitting
here
squished
together
like
a
bunch
of
moist
crayons
in
a
deluxe
Crayola
crayon
set.
As
if
on
cue,
the
class
applauded;
Mrs.
Rabitor
smiled
softly.
I
was
in
the
ninth
grade
and
had
discovered
my
first
simile.
My
sophomore
year
was
noticeably
more
challenging
and
Mrs.
Moulding
was
certainly
not
as
nurturing
as
my
initial
literary
mentor.
It
was
under
her
auspicious
however,
that
I
first
began
to
develop
as
a
writer.
Like
so
many
teachers
at
my
amply
endowed,
suburban
private
school
she
employed
a
rather
detailed
and
comprehensive
grading
procedure.
In
fact,
often
times
her
students
(although,
it
seemed
like
I
was
the
only
one)
received
back
a
paper
with
two
distinct
and
equally
significant
grades.
The
letter
to
the
left
of
the
pretentiously
strait
red
line
sought
to
evaluate
form
and
content,
while
the
one
to
the
right
represented
an
honest
appraisal
of
one's
grammar,
punctuation,
and
spelling.
My
difficulties,
both
consistent
and
comical
were
well
documented
and
appreciated
by
my
fellow
classmates.
Rarely
if
ever
did
I
drop
below
an
A-
on
the
content
side
of
the
line.
However,
with
respect
to
the
latter
grading
criteria,
I
seemed
to
have
been
plagued
by
an
insurmountable
urge
to
exit
the
house
before
actually
engaging
the
spell
checker.
Indeed,
some
of
my
more
noteworthy
blunders
wasted
no
time
rearing
their
ugly
heads
on
the
stray
notebooks
and
bathroom
walls
of
the
sophomore
hallway.
In
addition
to
being
my
basketball
coach
and
academic
advisor,
Tom
Manning
was
also
head
of
the
English
department.
His
third
year
writing
courses
were
always
filled
within
minutes
after
registration
opened.
I
was
informed
however,
that
he
was
saving
me
a
spot
in
his
afternoon
seminar.
He
said
I
brought
an
enthusiastic
voice
to
the
class
discussion.
I
was
by
then
notorious
for
being
easily
excitable
and
quick
to
pounce
on
any
who
opposed
my
position,
regardless
of
the
legitimacy
to
their
argument.
Little
did
I
know
however
that
his
afternoon
seminar
was
filled
with
mostly
seniors
and
some
outspoken
ones
at
that.
He
had
pitted
me
against
students
whom
I
considered
to
be
seasoned
intellectuals,
the
school's
elite
-
including
some
of
the
more
prominent
members
of
the
newspaper
staff.
It
was
in
that
atmosphere
where
I
first
began
to
understand
the
true
nature
of
debate.
When
engaged
in
both
verbal
ballistics
as
well
as
the
written
word,
it
became
obvious
that
an
argument
of
any
kind
required
that
a
theoretical
map
be
drawn
and
consequently
followed.
It
was
fine
and
reasonable
to
become
emotional.
Nevertheless,
without
honest
reason,
facts,
or
consistency
I
soon
realized
that
I
would
be
heard,
but
never
listened
to.
My
evolution
as
a
writer
has
taken
a
long
and
windy
path
often
stopping
along
the
way
due
to
a
lack
of
energy
or
unshakable
apathetic
tendencies.
At
every
stage
I
have
noticed
how
often
a
slow
progression
in
my
vocabulary
has
triggered
an
occasional
barrage
of
creative
and
coherent
sentences
and
generally
improved
the
quality
of
my
everyday
output.
The
summer
in-between
my
junior
and
senior
year
in
high
school
was
clearly
a
stop
which
provided
ample
insight
into
the
source
of
my
intellectual
ammunition.
Looking
back
it
should
have
at
the
very
least
been
painfully
clear
where
my
vocabulary
came
from.
Up
until
that
point
the
only
major
research
paper
I
had
written
was
on
Arnold
Red
Auerbach
the
greatest
basketball
mind
in
the
history
of
the
sport.
Every
reference
in
my
writing
to
success,
loss,
attitude,
and
lifestyle
came
from
the
annals
of
the
sports
section.
In
fact,
often
times
I
found
(or
forced)
a
place
in
practically
all
my
work
for
a
silky
smooth
quotation
right
out
of
that
day's
paper.
Whenever
possible
and
in
any
academic
subject,
my
goal
was
simply
to
incorporate
some
facet
of
athletic
competition
into
the
body
of
my
writing.
After
all,
it
was
what
I
knew
best
-
perhaps
better
than
any
of
my
other
peers.
It
was
something
that
was
first
recognized
by
an
insightful
Mrs.
Rabitor,
acknowledged
by
Mrs.
Moulding
and
effortlessly
fostered
by
an
encouraging
Mr.
Manning.
As
my
last
year
of
high
school
came
to
an
end
I
made
the
extraordinarily
difficult
decision
to
forgo
the
last
month
of
classes
and
embark
into
the
previously
uncharted
waters
of
the
senior
project.
I
was
lucky
enough
to
walk
into
an
incredible
opportunity.
Seemingly
a
match
made
in
educational
heaven,
I
worked
as
a
research
assistant
for
ghost
writer
William
Novak
as
he
prepared
to
finish
the
autobiography
of
Ervin
Magic
Johnson.
For
several
weeks
I
went
to
libraries
looking
for
obscure
magazine
issues
that
he
and
his
staff
had
previously
not
been
able
to
locate.
I
would
hand
in
a
short
summary
along
with
the
article
and
continue
on
my
way.
Unfortunately
that
for
me
was
the
only
problem.
I
wanted
to
hang
out,
talk
about
the
guys
he
had
interviewed,
and
read
the
editor's
copy.
He
just
wanted
me
to
leave.
Such
is
the
life
writer,
I
thought.
My
one
moment
of
glory
came
when
one
afternoon's
assignment
sounded
familiar.
I
asked
him
to
hold
on
while
I
put
down
the
phone
and
galloped
away
to
my
room.
I
returned
with
an
unshakable
grin.
You
mean
the
one
with
him
and
another
guy
on
the
cover
-
and
it
says
Super
Sophs,
I
said.
Yeah.
Why?
Well,
I
have
it.
You're
kidding
me?
He
said
in
a
voice
that
sounded
almost
intimidated.
Hey
listen,
I'll
be
happy
to
let
you
borrow
it
-
I
mean
it's
really
no
problem.
Uh,
ya
great.
Why
don't
you
bring
it
over
later
today
with
the
rest
of
the
stuff.
I
thought
he
was
going
to
cry,
but
he
didn't.
A
few
days
later
he
called
to
tell
me
that
he
was
back
from
Los
Angeles
where
he
just
finished
up
interview
sessions
with
Pat
Riely
(Magic's
coach)
and
Kareem
Abdul
Jabbar
(one
of
the
greatest
centers
to
ever
live).
He
asked
if
I
was
busy.
I
was
actually
having
dinner.
Nevertheless,
I
was
at
his
front
door
before
he
had
hung
up
the
phone.
He
returned
my
magazine;
It
was
signed
with
an
inscription
that
read
Dear
Josh,
Thanks
for
all
your
help
-sincerely,
Magic
Johnson.
After
that
summer
I
was
only
more
infatuated
with
the
seemingly
perfect
life
of
the
sports
writer.
I
began
to
incorporate
into
my
work
ever
more
jargon
from
the
columns
I
read
than
ever
before.
One
morning
there
was
a
well
crafted
and
incredibly
perceptive
article
by
Dan
Shaunessey,
the
award
winning
sports
editorialist
from
the
Boston
Globe.
In
it
he
described
a
recent
victory
by
the
Celtics
as
a
definite
turning
point
in
a
rather
tumultuous
season.
In
one
of
the
most
well
conceived,
simple
and
accurate
sentences
I
have
ever
read,
he
wrote
that
after
the
game
even
the
normally
stoic
Robert
Parrish
Grinned.
Immediately,
I
cut
it
out.
Now,
three
years
later
I
realize
that
since
the
moment
I
discovered
it,
I
have
most
certainly
claimed,
redefined
and
generally
abused
the
word
stoic.
I
think
the
pinnacle
of
literary
obsession
came
when
I
used
the
word
to
describe
my
sleeping
newborn
brother.
It
was
clear
at
least
to
me,
that
when
I
entered
Lafayette
College
a
new
chapter
was
about
to
written
in
my
life
as
a
writer.
My
first
college
course
was
English
101
with
Professor
June
Schlueter,
then
the
head
of
the
English
department.
Throughout
the
semester
we
wrote
four
or
five
papers
which
had
to
be
peer
critiqued
before
they
could
be
handed
in.
This
bothered
me
tremendously.
However,
I
was
surprisingly
close
with
one
other
kid
in
the
class
so
we
decided
to
become
editing
partners
for
the
duration
of
the
course.
Jeff
was
a
decent
writer.
He
thought
he
was
an
incredible
writer.
Moreover,
after
every
exchange
of
papers,
he
would
proceed
to
explain
to
me
how
what
I
had
written
was
entirely
wrong.
It
annoyed
me
that
he
felt
justified
in
handing
out
unrequested
literary
advice.
I
felt
he
was
in
no
position
to
offer
criticism,
after
all,
he
too
was
an
unrefined
first
year
writer.
I
wanted
simply
to
hand
in
the
paper
and
then
discuss
it
with
the
professor
at
the
appropriate
time.
At
the
end
of
the
semester
Prof.
Schlueter
called
Jeff
and
I
into
her
office.
She
explained
how
much
our
work
had
progressed
as
we
continued
to
edit
and
critique
each
other.
She
felt
that
we
had
been
one
of
the
best
peer
critiquing
pairs
that
she
had
seen
in
a
while
and
she
hoped
we
would
continue
to
work
together
next
semester
in
English
205.
We
were
the
only
two
students
from
her
section
of
English
101
to
move
on
to
the
advanced
class
and
at
the
request
of
the
professor,
we
both
submitted
work
to
The
Marquis
magazine.
English
205
for
me
was
more
of
an
exercise
in
clearly
expressing
my
views
orally
rather
than
through
writing
cohesive
papers.
I
enjoyed
a
new
challenge
everyday
as
I
had
consistently
managed
to
pit
myself
against
some
unexpecting
member
of
the
class.
Guessing
that
no
other
English
class
would
be
as
appealing
as
the
many
Government
classes
available,
I
opted
for
a
major
in
the
latter.
I
became
accustomed
to
research,
analysis
and
argument.
However,
I
longed
for
a
forum
where
I
could
allow
my
more
naturally
sarcastic
writing
style
to
feed
and
grow.
Then
one
evening
last
year
the
Reverend
Al
Sharpton
came
to
speak
on
campus.
After
hearing
him
and
the
questions
he
was
asked,
I
became
unusually
motivated.
That
was
it.
I
decided
I
was
going
to
write
something,
refine
it
and
then
send
it
to
the
newspaper.
Even
though
it
was
a
serious
piece,
after
that
experience
I
decided
that
the
only
good
place
to
enjoy
a
more
sarcastic
style
was
in
a
newspaper.
So,
when
asked
to
join
the
95
-
96
staff,
I
gladly
excepted.
To
be
rather
honest
however,
it
has
indeed
taken
me
some
time
to
learn
how
to
value
a
thoughtful
reaction
to
something
I
have
written.
In
fact,
even
to
this
day,
before
I
hand
in
any
paper
I
call
my
parents
and
read
it
to
them
over
the
phone.
I
figure
if
I
can't
take
what
my
parents
dish
out,
how
will
I
ever
be
able
to
work
with
anyone
else.
I
wonder
what
my
mother
would
say
about
this
one?
