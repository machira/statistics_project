Returning
WA
Narrative
8/19/11
Drafting
Writing
this
essay,
I
am
facing
the
beginning
of
my
third
year
as
a
WA
and
my
final
year
of
my
college
career.
The
pressure
to
have
a
wealth
of
knowledge
and
sage
advice
to
pass
down
is
mounting
and
I
feel
almost
as
anxious
to
excel
in
my
role
as
a
NmentorO
as
I
felt
on
my
first
day
as
a
WA.
I
find
myself
drafting
this
essay
looking
for
the
perfect
sentence,
the
perfect
word,
on
the
very
first
try.
However,
these
past
two
years
have
taught
me
to
embrace
the
failed
attempts,
false
starts,
and
red
marks
on
paper
that
are
part
of
reaching
the
finished
process.
I
believe
that
the
greatest
lesson
that
my
WA
experience
has
taught
me
about
my
own
writing
(and
life
as
well)
is
to
lighten
up;
to
not
put
so
much
pressure
on
myself
to
be
instantaneously
perfect
and
realize
that
working
through
something
is
just
as
valuable
as
the
end
result.
There
have
been
times
as
a
WA,
especially
when
I
was
just
starting,
where
I
found
myself
questioning
my
adequacy.
I
anxiously
wondered
if
I
was
doing
this
right,
if
I
really
had
what
it
took
to
help
my
fellow
students.
There
will
always
be
those
brief
moments
of
panic
for
me,
but
now
IOve
learned
to
keep
in
mind
the
reason
I
became
a
WA:
I
love
writing.
I
love
to
go
over
sentences,
paragraphs,
and
playing
with
words.
I
love
helping
people
write.
Yes,
there
have
been
frustrating
moments
as
a
WA,
stressful
periods
of
marathon
conferences
and
times
when
juggling
your
own
work
and
work
as
a
WA
has
seemed
overwhelming,
but
I
can
not
picture
my
years
at
Lafayette
complete
without
this
experience.
My
first
draft
would
be
my
sophomore
year,
my
first
year
as
a
WA.
My
excitement
in
August
upon
receiving
the
email
that
I
was
chosen
to
be
a
WA
was
quickly
matched
by
my
own
self-doubt
and
fears.
All
right,
so
the
College
Writing
Program
had
seen
something
in
me
that
they
thought
was
the
material
of
a
good
Writing
Associate,
but
I
was
a
little
less
convinced.
My
anxieties
were
somewhat
alleviated
during
our
WA
orientation.
I
now
had
a
few
lifelines
to
go
off,
tips
for
conferences,
and
specifics
to
look
out
for
in
student
papers.
However,
facing
my
first
round
of
conferences,
I
began
thinking
of
all
the
worst
possible
scenarios.
I
looked
at
the
other
WAs,
all
of
whom
seemed
to
me
to
be
old
pros,
and
assumed
that
they
had
had
all
the
correct
answers
right
away.
Looking
back
on
it
now,
I
can
see
how
absurd
that
assumption
was.
My
preconceived
notion
of
the
College
Writing
Program
was
not
unlike
the
Navy
SEALS
or
the
Marines-
something
like
an
elite
squad
of
highly
trained
writers
and
editors.
While
we
do
host
some
of
the
best
and
brightest
in
the
school
on
our
staff
without
question,
I
have
also
learned
through
the
years
and
many
staff
meetings
that
being
a
WA
is
just
as
much
about
learning
and
perfecting
our
skills
as
WAs
as
it
is
for
the
students
we
work
with.
We
are
always
revising
and
re-working
techniques
and
theories
to
improve
ourselves
and
the
help
we
can
offer
our
peers.
I
began
to
realize
this
as
my
sophomore
year
progressed
and
started
to
feel
more
confident
during
conferences
and
they
quickly
became
an
integral
and
my
favorite
part
of
my
WA
experience.
This
self-consciousness
I
felt,
I
saw
reflected
in
the
students
who
were
sitting
in
front
of
me.
ItOs
no
secret
that
conferences
can
go
two
ways:
either
it
can
be
an
energetic
and
productive
meeting
where
the
student
is
responsive
and
involved,
or
it
can
be
a
silent,
awkward
or
stilted
affair
with
little
accomplished
despite
a
WAs
best
efforts.
The
two
key
elements
that
separate
these
two
conference
atmospheres
is
confidence
and
trust.
If
you
really
stop
to
think
about
it,
writing
is
very
personal.
It
is
the
reflection
of
a
personOs
own
words
and
ideas
on
paper
and
although
it
is
not
the
responsibility
of
a
WA
to
grade
the
studentsO
work,
there
have
been
times
when
I
have
sensed
that
is
what
the
student
I
am
working
with
is
bracing
for.
IOve
had
some
students
who
hesitantly
walk
through
the
door
of
Pardee
319
with
dread
written
all
over
their
faces.
Other
conferences
have
started
where
the
student
strides
in,
plops
their
essay
on
the
table
in
between
the
two
of
us,
and
already
has
a
list
of
things
they
want
to
discuss
and
go
over
together.
The
difference
between
these
two
types
of
students
is
confidence:
confidence
in
their
writing
ability,
confidence
in
the
WA
program.
However
the
attitudes
of
the
students
are,
as
a
WA
I
still
must
work
with
both
kinds,
and
that
is
where
trust
comes
into
play.
If
you
can
relate
to
that
hesitant
or
discouraged
student,
establish
a
relationship
thatOs
more
of
a
partnership
than
you
can
work
against
reducing
those
awkward
or
unproductive
conferences.
NIOm
really
not
a
writer.N
NIOve
never
really
been
good
at
writing
essays.O
Over
the
years
IOve
heard
those
statements,
or
a
variation
of
either
of
those,
every
other
conference
or
drop-in
hour.
The
most
rewarding
experience
IOve
had
as
a
WA
is
when
I
was
working
with
a
Freshman
Year
Seminar.
The
very
first
conference
I
had
with
the
class
was
just
to
introduce
myself
and
get
to
know
the
students
I
would
be
working
with.
One
girl
began
our
first
meeting
by
apologizing.
NIOm
really
sorry,
youOre
going
to
have
to
read
my
essays
this
semester,
so
IOm
just
apologizes
in
advance,O
she
said
to
me.
I
assured
her
that
no
apologies
were
necessary,
save
them
for
when
sheOd
miss
a
conference.
I
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
her,
and
was
surprised
when
I
read
her
writing
for
the
first
time
that
she
had
been
far
too
hard
on
herself.
Working
with
her
over
the
semester,
I
saw
her
move
past
her
own
hesitations
and
self-
made
road
blocks
and
by
our
last
conference
she
was
asking
me
information
on
how
to
apply
to
be
a
WA
herself.
Her
transformation
I
think
shows
one
of
the
strengths
of
the
facilative
approach
we
use
in
the
College
Writing
Program.
We
try
to
guide
the
students
towards
the
finished
product
rather
than
lead
them,
which
I
think
helps
establish
a
comfortable
atmosphere
in
a
conference
and
builds
trust
and
confidence
in
the
students
we
work
with.
Some
students
expect
to
give
their
papers
to
a
WA
and
like
spell-check
on
Word,
they
will
be
given
back
an
error
free,
perfect
copy.
That
kind
of
conference
benefits
neither
the
WA
nor
the
student.
By
asking
questions
to
the
student
and
putting
the
initiative
back
on
their
part
to
work
through
their
paper,
realize
the
weak
parts
as
well
as
the
strong
ones,
I
think
we
are
helping
them
in
the
moment
and
for
the
future.
The
facilitative
approach
relies
on
the
drafting
process
and
through
working
with
students
and
talking
about
different
strategies
and
theories
with
other
WAs
in
my
staff
meetings,
I
have
also
seen
its
impact
on
my
own
writing
and
views
towards
my
own
writing.
ItOs
easy
to
be
discouraged
or
frustrated
when
you
find
yourself
in
the
middle
of
an
essay,
with
all
of
your
fantastic
and
intelligent
points
collecting
in
your
head,
but
refusing
to
coherently
form
on
the
page
in
front
of
you.
With
the
facilitative
approach,
students
talk
out
there
paper
and
their
problems
with
the
WA
and
with
help,
analyze
their
own
paper
to
better
understand
where
they
went
wrong.
ItOs
through
this
Ntalking
outO
process
that
I
have
seen
students
achieve
mini
epiphanies
about
their
papers
or
points
and
I
began
to
use
the
same
techniques
in
my
own
assignments
for
other
classes.
For
an
Art
History
course
I
was
taking
in
my
junior
year,
the
big
assignment
of
the
semester
was
to
write
a
20-page
research
paper.
I
was
confident
in
my
topic,
my
argument,
and
began
researching
and
writing.
At
around
page
twelve,
I
stopped
myself.
I
had
been
on
a
roll,
so
sure
of
the
direction
I
was
heading
in
and
had
written
myself
in
circles.
Trying
to
create
the
perfect
paper
from
my
first
try
I
had
created
a
complicated
structure
and
organization
and
had
only
managed
to
confuse
myself.
NTime
to
WA
it!O
I
thought
to
myself,
and
went
through
a
mock
WA
conference
with
myself,
asking
myself
the
very
questions
I
would
ask
a
student
in
drop-in.
I
realized
that
the
topic
of
my
paper
was
far
too
broad
and
I
had
drifted
away
from
the
main
point.
I
was
able
to
bring
the
focus
in
and
clarify
and
what
was
ironic
about
this
situation
was
that
at
the
same
time
I
was
working
with
a
student
who
was
experiencing
the
same
problems
I
was.
The
student
was
writing
a
paper
about
charismatic
figures
and
had
chosen
Fidel
Castro.
However,
he
was
so
enthusiastic
about
his
topic
and
wanted
the
reader
to
get
the
best
possible
understanding
that
his
paper
had
trailed
off
into
a
history
lesson
about
Cuba,
Russian
Communism,
and
even
a
discussion
on
the
science
behind
missiles.
At
one
of
our
conferences,
he
confidently
answered
my
question
about
how
his
paper
was
going
with,
Ngot
it
all
figured
out,
research
is
done
and
everything,
just
need
to
put
it
all
in
there.O
He
was
so
sure
that
he
didnOt
need
my
help
that
I
knew
any
suggestions
I
made
about
the
paper
to
him
would
be
dismissed,
but
if
I
could
get
him
to
see
the
problems
in
the
paper
for
himself
then
progress
would
happen.
Using
the
facilitative
approach,
I
asked
him
to
identify
what
he
thought
his
thesis
statement
was.
Once
he
established
that,
I
then
went
through
almost
every
paragraph
with
him,
asking
first
what
each
one
was
about
and
when
he
told
me
what
it
was
supposed
to
be
about,
we
saw
together
what
he
had
actually
written.
NI
think
youOve
gone
a
little
off-track,O
I
told
him
at
the
end
of
the
conference.
NI
see
what
you
mean,
N
he
replied.
Of
course,
this
approach
to
conferences
depends
greatly
on
the
participation
of
the
student,
and
if
the
student
is
not
willing
to
participate,
then
it
can
lead
to
some
pretty
tricky
conferences.
I
was
working
with
one
student
who
without
fail
would
always
come
to
our
conferences
unprepared
and
uncommunicative.
He
never
had
a
full
draft
of
his
essay
or
if
he
did,
he
gave
one-word
answers
to
my
questions
about
it.
In
moments
like
these,
it
is
easy
to
get
frustrated
and
feel
like
giving
up.
Several
times
IOve
thought
to
myself,
why
am
I
wasting
both
of
our
times?
However
tenacity
works
out
in
the
end,
sometimes
you
just
have
to
keep
working
through
it,
even
when
the
conference
seems
to
be
heading
in
a
downward
spiral.
It
takes
experience
and
many
tries;
help
from
other
WAs
too,
to
figure
out
which
questions
to
ask
to
get
a
response
from
a
student.
IOve
had
plenty
of
times
when
one
conference
with
a
student
would
not
go
the
way
I
wanted,
but
our
next
meeting
I
tried
a
different
approach
or
method
and
learned
from
the
last
conference.
No
one
is
supposed
to
have
it
all
figured
out
the
first
time,
isnOt
that
one
of
the
assumptions
the
College
Writing
Program
is
based
on?
Just
as
I
was
helping
students
realize
this,
I
was
learning
it
as
well.
Each
semester
as
a
WA
has
been
a
subsequent
draft
in
the
story
of
my
experience
with
the
College
Writing
Program
and
my
own
growth
as
a
writer
and
peer-
editor.
Each
time
I
make
a
mistake
or
start
a
new
copy,
has
been
easier
than
the
last.
Just
as
I
have
seen
students
gain
confidence
in
their
own
writing
abilities,
I
realize
now
that
I
have
too.
To
say
that
as
a
senior
I
have
it
all
figured
out
would
be
a
false
statement.
Yet,
just
as
every
time
you
start
a
new
draft,
you
have
a
little
bit
more
to
work
with
than
before,
I
have
three
years
of
college
and
two
years
of
being
a
WA
as
my
foundation
to
begin
scripting
this
last
year.
It
is
nice
now
to
be
able
to
offer
advice
or
help
to
my
other
WAs
beginning
their
experience
or
continuing
their
journey
and
to
learn
things
from
them.
While
writing
is
a
personal
act,
the
writer
can
always
benefit
from
help
and
guidance
from
others.
I
have
learned
that
first
and
foremost
one
needs
confidence
in
yourself
and
the
confidence
to
make
a
mistake,
cross
out,
and
keep
writing.
