Writing
Associate
Literacy
Narrative
From
the
moment
my
knowledge
of
the
English
language
went
beyond
penmanship
lessons
and
evolved
into
the
most
basic
kind
of
understanding,
I
found
great
joy
in
expressing
myself
through
writing.
On
my
sixth
or
seventh
birthday
I
received
my
first
journal,
and
I
was
overjoyed.
Day
after
day
I
recorded
the
details
of
my
somewhat
simplistic
life.
Whether
I
was
writing
about
what
I
ate
for
lunch,
who
I
NgotO
in
tag,
or
who
I
sat
next
to
on
the
bus
ride
home,
I
excitedly
filled
every
page.
Throughout
the
year
my
writing
would
steadily
improve,
the
sentences
becoming
more
coherent
and
grammatically
correct.
By
my
next
birthday
I
was
ready
for
a
new
journal,
a
fresh
supply
of
blank
pages
for
me
to
scribble
my
childish
renditions
of
day
to
day
life.
My
parents
took
note
of
my
inclination
to
journaling
and
supplied
me
with
another
diary.
The
emptiness
of
the
pages
left
me
with
a
feeling
of
new
possibilities,
and
somehow
nothing
that
happened
meant
as
much
until
it
was
in
my
juvenile
scribble.
By
the
next
year
receiving
journals
was
a
tradition,
and
every
year
after
that
I
was
reassured
that
I
could
always
guess
at
least
one
of
my
presents
and
I
would
always
be
satisfied
about
at
least
one
present.
Each
year
the
journals
filled
faster
and
faster
as
I
learned
to
write
in
greater
detail.
I
believe
these
journals
helped
me
build
a
great
foundation
for
my
future
as
a
writer.
Learning
how
to
express
myself
in
writing
has
been
an
invaluable
tool
and
this
medium
forged
a
love
of
the
written
word
at
a
very
young
age.
Eventually
I
was
ready
to
entertain
the
idea
of
showing
others
my
writing
capabilities.
Although
I
was
proud
of
my
journals,
and
wanted
to
show
my
parents
and
peers
my
work,
the
writing
within
these
notebooks
was
too
private.
To
expand
my
audience,
formally
of
only
one,
I
began
writing
letters
to
friends
and
family.
I
wrote
about
events
in
my
own
life,
from
things
I
was
learning
in
school
to
fun
things
I
had
done
on
the
weekends.
Homework,
family
vacations,
shopping
trips
or
new
pets,
it
all
became
part
of
the
content
of
my
letters.
I
pushed
myself
to
write
in
letters
what
I
could
have
communicated
easily
by
phone.
These
correspondences,
some
of
which
continue
to
this
day,
have
become
incredibly
important
to
me.
Not
only
did
these
letters
expose
me
to
the
styles
and
expressions
of
more
mature
writers,
but
they
helped
me
to
develop
my
own
voice
when
communicating
with
others
rather
than
just
writing
for
myself.
These
letters
now
have
immense
sentimental
value.
Aside
from
the
correspondences
I
kept
up
with
friends
and
family
members
my
parents
required
me
to
write
thank
you
letters
after
my
birthday
and
Christmas.
I
believe
this
experience
helped
me
to
expand
my
vocabulary
and
literary
skills,
as
my
parents
would
not
accept
30
cards
with
Nthank
you
very
muchO
simply
written
inside.
Throughout
my
early
school
years
every
class
seemed
the
same
to
me.
I
had
no
particular
love
for
one
class
over
another
(except
gym
obviously,
but
what
young
child
doesnOt
love
dodgeball?)
and
no
particular
difficulties
with
any
subject
over
another.
Although
I
was
indifferent
towards
the
subjects
I
studied
I
consistently
was
earning
higher
marks
in
whatever
classes
required
writing.
Starting
in
third
grade,
when
book
reports
and
research
papers
were
required
regularly,
I
learned
how
to
describe
the
writing
of
others
with
my
own.
This
experience
was
integral
to
my
development
as
a
writer,
and
created
a
solid
foundation
for
learning
how
to
comprehend
and
synthesize
information.
Being
asked
to
read
books
that
were
at
a
challenging
level
showed
me
how
writing
was
meant
to
be.
Learning
the
skills
it
took
to
summarize
and
make
inferences
also
helped
me
to
analytically
examine
what
I
read.
We
were
encouraged
to
include
weekly
vocabulary
in
our
reports,
with
extra
points
as
motivation.
This
cemented
the
new
words
in
my
mind
and
expanded
my
vocabulary
greatly.
Through
basic
research
papers
such
as
reports
about
a
species
of
animal
or
short
biographical
essays,
I
gained
the
ability
to
not
only
express
my
thoughts
accurately
and
elaborately,
but
also
to
research
and
support
my
opinions
and
present
arguments
in
an
articulate
fashion.
It
was
in
doing
these
assignments
that
I
also
began
to
learn
certain
fundamentals
of
writing,
such
as
grammar,
quotations,
and
citations.
I
distinctly
remember
my
fourth
grade
teacher
being
instrumental
in
my
growth
as
a
writer.
We
were
regularly
given
blank
outlines
to
fill
out,
with
spaces
for
a
standard
five
paragraph
essay,
topic
sentences,
and
supporting
points.
These
lessons
in
organization
have
continued
to
help
me
all
the
way
into
college.
I
have
learned
the
importance
of
an
outline
for
the
success
of
any
strong
paper.
With
each
new
class
I
take,
and
each
different
prompt
I
receive,
I
find
that
although
my
outline
needs
to
be
adapted
a
little
the
same
basic
concept
has
worked
for
me
as
a
solid
basis
for
outlining
and
brainstorming.
In
middle
school,
I
began
to
learn
about
possibly
the
most
important
concept
in
writing:
the
thesis.
This
was
also
the
beginning
of
writing
becoming
more
of
a
creative
process
of
expression,
and
less
simple
plot
descriptions
and
summaries.
At
this
point,
writing
took
on
a
whole
new
meaning
for
me.
It
was
not
only
something
to
do
in
my
spare
time,
but
became
a
passion
and
something
I
could
see
myself
doing
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
I
think
my
growth
as
a
writer
was
particularly
noticeable
in
my
eighth
grade
literature
class
where
my
teacher
and
I
constantly
butted
heads.
It
seemed
to
me
she
was
never
satisfied
with
me
as
a
person,
nothing
I
did
was
right.
It
was
not
until
I
received
the
Literature
Award
on
graduation
day
from
her
that
I
realized
it
was
not
a
personal
struggle
between
us
but
her
way
of
pushing
me
to
be
a
better
writer.
She
had
pulled
a
fast
one
on
me
because
honestly,
with
each
new
draft
of
a
paper
I
would
think
to
myself
Nha,
IOll
show
her,
this
one
will
have
to
knock
her
off
her
feet,
she
canOt
yell
at
me
for
anything
once
she
reads
thisO.
High
school
became
the
place
where
I
could
really
stretch
my
wings
as
a
writer.
There
were
many
more
reports
and
essays
to
be
written,
therefore
many
more
opportunities
to
expand
my
knowledge
and
ability.
In
9th
grade,
creative
writing,
as
well
as
persuasive
and
argumentative
essays,
were
immensely
helpful.
It
was
with
these
assignments
that
I
learned
how
to
clearly
and
concisely
formulate
and
support
an
argument.
I
also
learned
how
to
analyze
and
describe
characters
in
a
novel
on
a
higher
level,
which
helped
as
I
developed
my
own
characters
in
creative
writing.
Another
helpful
writing
experience
in
high
school
came
in
the
form
of
the
document
based
question
essays
we
were
required
to
write
for
our
history
classes.
These
essays
were
an
incredible
help
in
learning
how
to
use
quotations
appropriately
and
effectively
as
well
as
getting
information
about
audience,
tone,
etc.
with
time
constraints.
My
English
teacher
in
10th
grade
was
a
very
important
figure
in
my
journey
to
become
a
better
writer.
He
provided
each
of
his
students
with
a
journal
in
which
we
were
to
write
5
pages
a
week
about
any
topic.
He
never
read
these
journals,
unless
we
wanted
his
feedback,
but
told
us
it
was
important
for
students,
writers
and
non-writers
alike,
to
take
time
each
week
to
just
write.
This
writing
was
not
supposed
to
be
beautifully
composed
or
about
any
specific
topic,
it
was
rather
a
stream
of
thoughts
we
were
to
put
down
on
paper
to
lift
them
off
our
minds.
It
was
a
great
outlet,
and
showed
me
that
writing
can
be
therapeutic
and
beneficial
on
a
personal
level.
Both
11th
and
12th
grades
are
a
blur
of
SAT
and
AP
preparation.
This
was
the
most
intensive
expansion
of
my
ability
as
a
writer,
as
well
as
the
greatest
test
of
what
I
had
learned.
In
preparation
for
my
English
and
Literature
APOs,
I
learned
how
to
write
quickly,
as
the
essays
are
timed,
while
still
arguing
and
supporting
a
point
effectively.
I
believe
this
experience
helped
me
to
correct
my
bad
habit
of
being
long-winded
in
my
writing.
It
helped
me
to
keep
my
writing
clear
and
concise
and
finally
pulled
me
away
from
my
terrible
habit
of
run-on
sentences.
After
my
first
year
in
college,
I
am
confident
that
my
experiences
in
high
school
prepared
me
incredibly
well
for
what
I
will
face
in
the
future,
not
only
in
school
but
after
that
as
well.
I
found
my
FYS
class,
where
freshmen
are
supposed
to
be
taught
to
write
on
a
Ncollege
levelO,
a
breeze.
I
was
almost
shocked
at
how
easy
it
was
to
please
my
teacher
with
essays
that
I
had
written
at
1
AM
the
night
before
and
hadnOt
even
had
a
chance
to
re-read.
That
was
the
point
when
I
came
to
accept
that
I
had
mastered
the
basic
essay
forms
such
as
persuasive,
argumentative,
narrative,
descriptive,
compare
and
contrast,
change
over
time,
etc.
Calling
my
FYS
class
a
breeze
was
not
to
say
I
did
not
struggle
with
writing
in
my
first
year
at
Lafayette.
The
basic
outline
I
had
always
worked
with
fit
perfectly
into
the
writing
required
of
me
from
that
class,
but
I
could
not
say
the
same
for
my
other
courses.
In
a
philosophy
class
I
took
first
semester
our
only
essays
were
part
of
tests.
We
would
be
given
a
large
list
of
questions
in
our
study
guides
to
think
about
without
knowing
which
ones
would
actually
appear
on
the
exam.
Once
given
our
exams
we
usually
had
a
choice
of
what
topics
to
discuss.
What
I
found
difficult
about
these
essays,
other
than
the
time
constraints
that
still
clashed
with
my
long-windedness
(although
I
had
gotten
better
at
being
concise
from
my
SAT,
ACT,
and
AP
preparations)
was
that
the
professor
gave
just
a
list
of
questions
per
topic
and
we
were
expected
to
make
our
separate
answers
to
each
question
into
a
flowing
response
to
one
topic.
Without
ample
time
to
brainstorm
and
organize
my
ideas
I
found
these
essays
to
be
quite
a
challenge.
Practice
and
taking
care
to
understand
and
utilize
my
professorOs
scribbled
correction
notes
helped
me
improve
throughout
the
course.
I
had
the
most
difficulty
writing
essays
for
a
politics
class
I
was
also
taking
first
semester.
It
was
nothing
like
the
elementary
essays
I
had
written
up
until
then,
therefore
it
in
no
way
fit
into
my
basic
outline.
The
professor
asked
us
to
make
a
question
about
a
political
theory
concerning
whatever
book
we
were
reading,
answer
that
question
with
the
body
of
our
essay,
supporting
it
with
fifteen
to
twenty
references
to
the
book,
and
then
prove
the
exact
opposite
point
at
the
end.
I
did
not
know
where
a
thesis
fit
into
there.
I
did
not
know
how
to
use
that
many
citations
with
out
losing
my
voice
as
the
writer
and
depending
on
the
text.
I
did
not
understand
how
I
could
make
up
a
question,
answer
it,
and
then
fight
against
it.
After
multiple
visits
to
my
professor
during
office
hours
and
many
drafts
of
the
same
papers,
as
well
as
the
help
of
the
WA
drop-in
service,
I
became
somewhat
comfortable
with
this
form
of
writing.
It
was
great
to
finish
the
first
semester
with
the
knowledge
that
I
had
broken
from
my
elementary
outline
and
adjusted
myself
as
a
writer
to
two
completely
foreign
essay
formats.
Learning
to
be
a
flexible
writer
has
been
my
most
invaluable
lesson
to
date,
because
even
through
high
school
I
felt
my
papers
all
seemed
to
sound
the
same
regardless
of
the
great
variance
in
topic.
Learning
to
write
my
essays
in
a
different
format
has
brought
me
to
the
understanding
that
I
am
capable,
of
course
with
practice,
of
writing
for
any
type
of
class
and
in
any
style
my
professor
requests
of
me.
