As
I
think
back
to
my
earliest
memory
of
writing,
I
realize
that
even
then
I
was
challenging
myself.
It
was
the
day
before
kindergarten
open
house,
and
my
five
year
old
peers
and
I
were
making
cards
to
put
on
display
for
our
parents.
As
I
carefully
cut
a
heart
shape
out
of
a
piece
of
red
construction
paper
with
a
pair
of
clunky
child-proof
scissors,
I
looked
around
at
the
other
childrenOs
designs
for
inspiration.
Some
kids
were
drawing
stick
figure
versions
of
their
families;
others
were
scrawling
flowers
and
clouds
all
over
their
cards.
However,
I
very
distinctly
remember
that
the
majority
of
my
classmates
were
simply
scribbling
all
over
their
cards,
two
or
three
crayons
in
each
little
hand.
I
wanted
mine
to
be
pretty,
but
most
importantly
I
wanted
it
to
be
stand
out
to
my
parents
amongst
a
wall
of
doodles.
By
the
time
I
had
finished
cutting,
I
thought
of
a
way
to
set
my
card
apart.
Before
we
started
our
projects,
the
teacher
had
announced
that,
in
the
interest
of
coherency,
she
would
be
writing
any
words
that
we
wanted
to
include
in
our
cards
for
us
when
we
were
finished
making
them.
Deciding
to
be
a
three
and
a
half
foot
tall
rebel,
I
took
matters
into
my
own
hands
and
sounded
out
my
very
first
piece
of
writing.
As
it
turned
out,
I
did
a
fairly
good
job.
My
teacher
wasnOt
angry
that
I
had
written
the
words
myself,
and
I
think
my
mom
and
dad
were
delighted
with
the
message
they
saw
scrawled
in
blue
crayon
on
a
jaggedly
cut
red
construction
paper
heart:
i
Lov
mY
PArEns.
IOm
a
bit
disappointed
to
admit
that
the
next
few
years
are
something
of
a
blur
when
it
comes
to
writing.
I
know
it
seems
strange
that,
after
such
a
promising
beginning
as
a
renegade
kindergartner
author,
the
following
years
would
proceed
without
any
notable
written
progress.
However,
it
was
during
that
time
period
that
I
discovered
the
influences
that
would
teach
me
more
about
writing
than
I
would
ever
learn
in
a
classroom:
books.
In
first
grade
I
cracked
open
The
MagicianOs
Nephew,
the
first
novel
in
the
classic
series
authored
by
C.
S.
Lewis
known
as
the
Chronicles
of
Narnia.
It
was
difficult
at
first;
in
fact,
there
were
some
parts
of
the
book
that
my
dad
had
to
read
out
loud
to
me.
But
after
I
finished
that
book,
I
never
looked
back.
I
tore
through
the
rest
of
LewisO
series
with
a
dictionary
sitting
at
my
side,
patiently
looking
up
every
word
I
couldnOt
understand.
When
I
finished
that
series,
I
ran,
pulling
my
mother
behind
me,
into
the
local
library
looking
for
a
new
one.
I
dabbled
until
I
discovered
the
Nancy
Drew
series.
If
anyone
was
wondering
how
many
original
Nancy
Drew
novels
there
are,
I
could
clarify
that
there
are
56
because
I
read
every
single
one.
I
could
also
say
that
there
are
119
other
Nancy
Drew
books,
of
which
I
read
about
half.
Then
came
Redwall,
and
later
on
Harry
Potter
and
Artemis
Fowl;
much
of
my
elementary
school
years
were
spent
with
my
nose
buried
in
a
book.
My
appetite
for
reading
was
insatiable.
My
mom
took
me
to
the
library
once
a
week
to
get
two
books
which
I
would
exchange
for
two
more
the
next
week.
When
other
kids
spent
ten
dollars
at
the
book
fair
on
the
new
book
with
the
sparkly
cover,
I
figured
out
how
to
get
twelve
books
for
my
ten
dollars.
I
read
all
day,
and
when
I
absolutely
couldnOt
put
it
down
to
go
to
sleep,
I
read
my
novel
by
the
light
of
my
alarm
clock.
Soon
enough,
the
eyestrain
led
to
the
deterioration
of
my
eyesight
and
I
had
to
get
glasses.
But
I
couldnOt
have
cared
less;
I
was
a
four-eyed
bookworm
who
saw
reading
as
a
privilege.
What
I
didnOt
realize
was
that
I
wasnOt
just
getting
to
know
and
love
hundreds
of
characters,
learning
new
things,
and
generally
losing
myself
in
enjoyable
books.
I
was
learning
how
to
write.
The
next
memory
I
have
of
my
writing
was
in
fourth
grade,
somewhere
between
Redwall
and
Harry
Potter.
By
this
time,
I
wrote
with
nearly
perfect
grammar,
which
had
far
less
to
do
with
what
I
learned
in
school
and
more
to
do
with
the
incessant
flow
of
excellent
literature
I
exposed
myself
to.
I
knew
that
dependent
clauses
cannot
be
sentences
in
themselves,
how
to
use
a
semicolon,
and
the
difference
between
OthenO
and
Othan,O
even
though
I
had
no
formal
instruction
as
to
doing
any
of
these
things.
In
fact,
if
I
was
asked
what
a
dependent
clause
was
in
fourth
grade,
I
highly
doubt
that
I
could
give
a
definition.
But
I
knew
how
to
use
it
and
how
to
use
it
correctly,
and
I
had
no
problem
notifying
my
teacher,
Mrs.
Cornman,
if
she
wasnOt
doing
so
(thank
goodness
she
was
a
very
patient
woman).
Mrs.
Cornman
was
particularly
fond
of
social
studies,
and
we
were
in
the
middle
of
a
unit
on
government
when
she
instructed
us
to
write
a
letter
to
our
local
legislator
about
a
hypothetical
regulation,
law,
or
policy
that
we
were
opposed
to.
Most
kids
groaned
as
she
wrote
the
assignment
on
the
board,
but
in
my
twisted,
nerdy
little
mind
I
was
excited
to
write
it.
I
got
home
from
school
that
day
and
hardly
said
hello
to
my
mother
as
I
threw
my
backpack
on
the
floor
and
ran
up
to
my
room.
IOm
not
really
sure
why
I
thought
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
write
a
letter
in
pink
pen
on
rainbow
colored
stationary
to
my
imaginary
legislator,
but
thatOs
exactly
what
I
selected.
I
remember
very
clearly
how
I
began
the
letter:
To
Assemblywoman
Swanson,
It
has
come
to
the
attention
of
the
good
people
of
Chester
that
your
policy
concerning
waste
management
is
inconvenient,
expensive,
and
generally
detrimental
to
the
citizens
of
this
townE
As
my
mom
strained
to
read
the
pink
lettering
on
the
obnoxiously
colorful
stationary,
she
looked
a
bit
perplexed.
When
she
finished,
she
looked
at
me
and
said,
NSweetheart,
how
exactly
did
you
write
a
three
paragraph
letter
on
an
imaginary
waste
management
policy?
Are
you
sure
Mrs.
Cornman
wanted
it
to
be
this
long
withEso
many
big
words?O
With
a
smile,
I
happily
took
the
letter
out
of
my
motherOs
hands
and
tucked
it
away
in
my
backpack.
The
next
day
I
placed
my
letter
in
a
plain,
boring
pile
of
white
letters
on
Mrs.
CornmanOs
desk.
By
the
end
of
the
day,
Mrs.
Cornman
was
approaching
my
desk,
rainbow
parchment
in
hand.
NDid
you
write
this
yourself?O
she
asked.
When
I
nodded
my
head,
confused
at
what
the
problem
was,
she
mumbled
something
about
Ngood
jobO
and
went
back
to
her
desk.
From
that
point
on,
Mrs.
Cornman
was
sold
on
my
writing.
She
loved
everything
I
turned
into
her.
IOd
even
written
a
silly
little
poem
for
an
assignment
once
and
she
told
my
mother
she
would
see
what
she
could
do
about
getting
it
published.
Of
course,
there
was
nothing
outstanding
about
the
poem;
it
rhymed,
and
it
made
sense,
and
everything
had
been
spelled
correctly.
I
thought
nothing
of
it.
In
fact,
without
grades
as
an
indicator,
I
wouldnOt
have
any
idea
of
the
quality
of
my
writing.
As
far
as
I
was
concerned,
there
was
the
correct
way
to
write
and
the
wrong
way,
and
I
was
doing
a
pretty
good
job
of
doing
it
the
right
way.
The
very
next
memory
I
have
of
writing
was
a
turning
point
for
me,
and
it
happened
only
a
year
later.
I
was
in
fifth
grade
and
praising
the
Lord
that
the
D.A.R.E.
(drug
abuse
resistance
education)
program
was
coming
to
an
end.
The
only
good
that
D.A.R.E
ever
did
me
was
that
it
got
me
out
of
math
class
and,
on
special
occasions,
I
got
to
hold
Daren,
the
D.A.R.E.
lion.
Our
instructor
explained
that
our
very
last
task
for
this
program
was
to
write
an
essay
explaining
what
D.A.R.E.
taught
us
and
why
we
were
going
to
dedicate
ourselves
to
being
drug
free.
The
best
essay
would
be
chosen
from
each
class,
and
the
student
who
wrote
it
would
have
the
honor
of
reading
it
at
graduation.
To
be
perfectly
honest,
fifth
grade
was
the
absolute
peak
of
my
nerdiness,
and
even
I
could
not
get
excited
about
this
assignment.
I
didnOt
want
anything
to
do
with
winning
that
NhonorO
because
I
wasnOt
particularly
interested
in
putting
two
hundred
people
to
sleep
at
our
quasi-graduation
with
the
most
vapid
piece
of
writing
they
had
ever
heard.
When
I
got
home
from
school
and
explained
this
to
my
mom,
she
agreed
that
the
topic
made
for
a
boring
essay.
NSo
challenge
yourself,O
she
encouraged
me.
NMake
the
uninteresting,
well,
interesting.O
I
thought
about
this
for
a
moment,
and
soon
my
mind
wandered
back
to
my
fourth
grade
self.
I
remembered
how
excited
Mrs.
Cornman
got
about
that
poem
I
had
written,
and
so
I
figured
IOd
give
that
genre
a
try.
By
this
time
my
family
had
just
gotten
a
computer,
so
I
sat
down
and
got
to
work.
By
this
I
mean
I
played
with
the
formatting
for
about
an
hour
before
my
mom
came
over
and
yelled
at
me,
and
then
I
actually
began
typing
out
my
poem.
I
made
sure
it
rhymed
and
made
sense,
making
good
use
out
of
one
of
the
newest
resources
I
had
discovered:
the
thesaurus.
When
I
had
finished,
my
parents
looked
it
over
and
were
pleased
with
it,
so
I
printed
it
out
to
bring
for
school
the
next
day.
Sure
enough,
amidst
a
pile
of
drawling
papers
about
abstinence
from
drugs,
my
poem
won.
I
was
actually
a
little
bit
proud
that
I
was
getting
to
read
my
first
real
piece
of
creative
writing
at
graduation.
As
it
turns
out,
no
one
fell
asleep.
Looking
back,
I
find
it
interesting
how
my
writing
evolved.
I
learned
how
to
write,
then
how
to
write
well,
and
then
how
to
write
creatively,
making
my
work
my
own.
Then
I
got
to
middle
school
and
high
school,
where
I
quickly
realized
that
I
was
looking
at
the
end
of
my
progress
for
a
while.
In
New
York
State,
and
particularly
at
Chester
Academy,
the
Regents
Exams
are
a
huge
deal.
Depending
on
how
an
individual
did
on
the
exam,
he
or
she
could
earn
honors
at
graduation
or
even
a
scholarship.
But
more
importantly
(to
the
faculty,
at
least),
the
better
a
class
did
as
a
whole,
the
better
the
chance
that
that
classO
teacher
wouldnOt
get
fired.
Consequently,
every
department
began
teaching
specifically
for
the
various
Regents
Exams,
and
the
English
department
was
no
exception.
However,
to
make
matter
worse,
because
the
English
Regents
was
administered
to
eleventh
graders,
my
classmates
and
I
were
not
privilege
to
just
one
year
but
about
four
years
of
less
than
exemplary
English
education.
Simply,
they
drilled
the
Regents
method
of
writing
into
us
for
one
exam,
and
after
that
test
we
were
to
forget
everything
we
learned.
ThatOs
correct;
for
four
years
we
were
taught
the
way
we
would
never
have
to
write
again
for
the
rest
of
our
lives;
a
way
of
writing
that
was
a
sure
way
to
fail
senior
year
and
college
English.
Not
surprisingly,
those
were
some
of
the
most
frustrating
years
of
my
life
when
it
came
to
writing.
The
basic
premise
of
Regents
writing
was
to
analyze
literary
elements
in
a
generalized
and
rigidly
organized
manner.
I
appreciate
literary
elements
as
much
as
anyone,
but
by
eleventh
grade
I
was
sick
of
the
symbolism
and
characterization
and
tone.
Did
Harper
Lee
really
plan
on
naming
her
main
character
Scout
because
she
has
a
curious
personality
and
is
always
searching
for
answers?
Well
that
certainly
makes
sense,
but
maybe
she
chose
it
by
chance.
If
it
really
wasnOt
a
coincidence,
which
IOm
sure
it
wasnOt,
it
is
certainly
something
to
think
about
and
maybe
a
reason
to
marvel
the
writing
skills
of
the
author.
But
it
isnOt
something
to
write
a
terrible
essay
about,
not
something
to
drawl
on
about
for
sentences
because
you
know
itOs
what
the
teacher
is
looking
for.
To
Kill
a
Mockingbird
is
one
of
my
favorite
books,
but
it
started
out
for
me
as
a
piece
of
writing
that
I
loathed
because
we
were
forced
to
pick
through
the
first
few
chapters
for
elements,
details,
and
quotes
to
put
in
our
essays.
Before
I
let
my
teacher
ruin
the
book
for
me,
I
read
through
the
entire
remainder
of
the
book
and
I
enjoyed
it,
believing
that
Harper
Lee
would
have
wanted
first
for
her
reader
to
appreciate
her
book
and
the
message
it
brought.
Maybe
then
she
would
have
wanted
us
to
analyze
every
symbol
she
tucked
into
her
masterpiece.
But
even
then,
I
donOt
think
she
would
have
endorsed
the
bland
format
of
the
Regents
essays.
I
wrote
so
many
of
them
that
the
format
is
engrained
in
my
memory;
they
were
always
five
paragraphs
in
length,
requiring
an
analysis
of
four
elements
between
two
books,
and
they
never
did
justice
to
the
literature
they
described.
By
the
end
of
this
ridiculous
writing
stint,
not
only
was
I
horrified
at
the
way
I
treated
so
many
of
the
most
classic
works
of
literature
of
all
time,
but
I
hadnOt
written
a
single
piece
of
original
writing
in
which
the
content
came
from
myself.
I
hadnOt
even
gotten
the
chance
to
discuss
something
about
which
I
was
passionate.
I
ended
up
getting
a
99
on
the
Regents,
but
aside
from
gaining
a
larger
vocabulary,
I
didnOt
feel
like
I
had
gained
anything
that
made
me
a
better
writer.
Then,
as
a
senior,
I
got
to
college
English,
and
as
promised,
we
were
told
to
forget
everything
we
had
learned
for
the
past
few
years
about
writing.
I
was
finally
able
to
enjoy
writing
again,
and
right
away
I
began
to
push
myself.
The
first
essay
that
I
was
assigned
had
to
be
about
the
single
greatest
hardship
in
my
life
and
how
it
was
affecting
me.
I
chose
soccer,
my
single
favorite
activity,
and
wrote
a
convincing
essay
about
how
regardless
of
my
love
for
it,
the
sport
was
leading
to
my
physical,
mental,
and
emotional
deterioration.
For
my
next
essay,
I
had
to
write
about
three
situations
that
taught
me
life
lessons,
but
since
I
thought
the
real
situations
werenOt
entertaining
enough,
I
made
up
completely
new
ones
and
wrote
about
them
in
great
detail.
I
learned
how
to
write
my
first
research
paper,
which
discussed
the
Romanov
mystery,
a
subject
that
I
was
especially
interested
in
learning
and
writing
about.
For
each
assignment,
I
sat
blissfully
scribbling
pages
and
pages
of
writing
with
a
pencil,
furiously
crossing
things
out
and
adding
things
in
until
I
created
seven
or
eight
drafts
from
which
I
would
eventually
type
up
my
final
version.
Just
as
I
thought
I
had
escaped
high
school
writing,
I
entered
into
the
second
half
of
the
year
to
realize
that
literary
elements
were
sneaking
back
into
my
life.
However,
this
wasnOt
high
school
English:
I
no
longer
had
to
suspend
the
kind
of
passionate,
thorough,
and
interesting
brand
of
writing
that
I
enjoyed
so
much.
I
got
to
pick
one
aspect
of
the
literature
and
analyze
its
importance
and
meaning
to
me,
the
reader.
This
was
such
a
welcome
change
from
producing
a
bland
and
inadequate
discussion
of
what
I
thought
the
teacher
wanted
me
to
say
about
what
the
author
was
trying
to
accomplish
(Confused?
Welcome
to
Regents
English).
It
was
an
incredibly
successful
year;
I
loved
my
teacher,
I
loved
my
writing,
and
I
felt
prepared
for
my
writing
courses
at
Lafayette.
And
then
suddenly,
I
found
myself
in
freshman
year
seminar
at
Lafayette.
I
was
pleased
to
see
that
I
had
gotten
into
a
class
that
I
had
placed
near
the
top
of
my
list
of
choices.
I
had
originally
selected
that
particular
class
thinking
that
it
was
about
urban
legends
and
myths,
topics
which
I
pictured
myself
enjoying
both
learning
and
writing
about.
I
was
about
to
find
out
that
it
was
about
far
more
than
just
those
subjects,
and
that
this
class
wasnOt
like
any
other
English
course
I
had
ever
taken.
As
soon
as
I
met
my
professor,
I
knew
we
had
almost
nothing
in
common.
His
interests
fell
mainly
within
the
subject
of
philosophy;
mine
lie
with
the
hard
sciences.
He
was
an
atheist,
and
I
was
raised
a
Catholic.
He
was
a
skeptic,
and
I
a
believer.
However,
we
did
share
one
thing;
a
passion
for
discussion
and
debate.
As
it
turned
out,
we
had
a
lot
to
talk
about;
those
subjects
which
I
thought
were
the
substance
of
the
course
were
a
mere
part
of
the
class
content.
We
were
calling
into
question
the
process
by
which
and
the
many
reasons
why
people
believe
what
they
believe
in,
be
it
in
luck,
ghosts,
psychics,
myths,
magic,
bewitchment,
or
the
ideals
of
cults.
We
touched
on
an
incredible
number
and
variety
of
subjects,
from
weightier
topics
like
religion
to
smaller,
simpler,
everyday
things,
like
having
a
hot
streak.
You
can
imagine
my
surprise
when
the
concept
of
a
hot
streak,
something
I
believed
whole-heartedly
in
and
seemed
to
forever
elude
for
the
duration
of
my
entire
softball
career,
was
debunked
before
my
very
eyes.
My
first
writing
assignment
for
the
class
was
a
research
paper
that
emphasized
the
sheer
ridiculousness
of
the
belief
that
immunizations
cause
autism;
it
was
pretty
dry,
but
well-argued
and
informative.
I
didnOt
care
much
about
it
because
I
saw
it
as
just
another
research
paper.
The
next
assignment,
however,
I
took
on
as
a
personal
challenge.
The
paper
had
to
be
an
argument
to
either
support
or
refute
the
idea
that
an
all-good,
all-knowing,
all-powerful
God
exists.
I
knew
perfectly
well
where
my
professor
stood
on
this
particular
issue,
and
I
also
knew
that
the
arguments
that
we
had
gone
over
in
class
were
much
stronger
for
the
refutation
of
the
existence
of
this
kind
of
God.
I
considered
my
somewhat
shaky
faith;
especially
because
I
am
a
science
major
and
a
somewhat
logical
person,
itOs
hard
for
me
to
not
doubt
the
existence
of
the
God
Christianity
describes.
I
could
have
easily
written
the
paper
to
agree
with
most
of
my
skeptical
classmates
and
my
professor,
but
I
chose
instead
to
take
on
the
challenge
of
proving
what
seemed
so
impossible
to
argue
during
class
discussions.
It
seemed
wrong
to
me
to
take
the
easy
way
out
when
I
knew
that
there
was
room
for
belief.
I
started
writing
the
paper
as
soon
as
I
got
out
of
class,
which
is
something
procrastinators
like
myself
almost
never
do.
IOd
say
that
I
ended
up
writing
about
five
typed
pages
that
I
didnOt
even
end
up
using,
and
when
I
was
finally
finished
I
still
had
a
paper
that
was
twice
the
required
length.
When
I
got
the
assignment
back
from
the
professor,
I
could
see
I
hadnOt
made
a
believer
out
of
him.
He
took
issue
with
several
of
my
points.
However,
he
was
very
pleased
with
the
apparent
effort
that
I
had
put
into
the
project,
and
although
I
hadnOt
convinced
him,
I
had
come
up
with
some
very
well
thought
out
arguments.
Seeing
a
98
at
the
top
of
my
paper
made
me
happier
than
any
A
I
had
received
on
a
science
midterm.
I
realize
that
the
recount
of
my
journey
from
crayons
to
pondering
the
existence
of
God
is
not
an
epic
one,
and
I
understand
that
Daren
the
D.A.R.E.
lion
really
isnOt
very
entertaining
anymore.
But
for
me,
it
has
been
a
path
to
discovery
of
my
own
ability
and
creativity,
a
constant
effort
to
challenge
and
better
myself,
and
an
invaluable
learning
experience.
I
canOt
find
my
heart-shaped
kindergarten
card,
so
I
really
have
no
proof
that
I
was
the
rebel
five
year
old
I
say
I
was.
To
Mrs.
CornmanOs
dismay,
I
will
probably
never
be
published.
And
unfortunately,
I
have
not
read
a
book
for
pleasure
in
a
long
time.
But
when
my
brother
asks
me
for
help
with
his
Regents
essay,
I
will
reluctantly
show
him
how
to
write
it.
I
will
never
be
afraid
to
challenge
others
or
myself.
And
I
have
the
upmost
faith
in
my
creativity.
However,
if
my
chemistry
professor
asks
for
my
homework,
I
do
not
think
I
will
hand
him
a
poem.
