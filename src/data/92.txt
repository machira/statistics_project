Writing
Like
A
WA
Being
a
WA,
you
still
have
to
write
your
own
paper.
For
the
past
year,
I
have
done
quite
some
writing
for
various
purposes.
However,
one
particular
writing
experience
stands
out
in
my
memory.
It
is
a
very
difficult
writing
experience,
though
with
a
happy
ending.
It
is
a
case
brief
I
wrote
for
my
Constitutional
Law
class.
It
means
a
lot
to
me,
not
only
because
it
took
so
much
time
and
effort,
but
because
it
is
the
single
most
rewarding
writing
experience
I
have
had.
Writing
in
that
particular
setting
is
no
longer
writing
itself,
it
is
the
presentation
of
one's
thought
and
a
learning
process.
Since
it
involves
legal
writing--a
totally
new
style
for
me,
it
also
better
prepared
me
for
my
role
as
aWA.
The
course
is
Constitutional
Law
and
Politics.
One
of
the
major
projects
of
the
class
is
that
we
have
to
collaboratively
write
a
case
brief
and
then
base
on
the
brief,
argue
the
case
in
front
of
a
panel
of
real
judges
and
lawyers.
And
the
first
step,
the
case
brief
itself.
It
is
called
a
brief.
But
it
is
in
no
way
brief.
Since
very
few
of
us
had
the
experience
of
writing
such
a
thing
before,
the
professor
handed
out
a
sample
brief
from
previous
students.
20
pages.
What's
worth
mentioning
is
that(we
found
this
out
later),
because
of
the
requirement
of
conciseness
of
legal
writing,
the
twenty
pages
is
actually
the
size
of
a
thirty-page
ordinary
paper.
It
would
be
much
better
if
we
only
had
to
worry
about
the
number
of
words
to
write.
The
first
obstacle
was
that
most
of
us
had
never
even
read
a
case
brief
before,
not
to
mention
written
one.
We
were
all
used
to
the
style
of
Writing
we
read
in
the
newspapers,
or
some
form
of
academic
writing.
However,
the
requirement
of
legal
writing,
especially
in
a
case
brief,
is
totally
different.
Conciseness,
poignant,
and
compactness
are
what
are
needed,
(which
I
now
believe
should
be
applied
to
more
fields
of
writing.)
Secondly,
the
format
of
a
case
brief--
how
to
describe
a
case,
the
order
to
approach
an
issue;
and
what
to
include
and
exclude--
is
very
strictly
specified.
Since
we
would
submit
this
brief
for
the
review
by
real
judges,
without
too
many
warnings
from
the
professor,
we
knew
we
had
to
at
least
make
the
format
right.
Otherwise,
we
would
have
already
lost
the
case
when
we
submitted
our
brief.
We
took
out
the
sample
paper
and
read
it
again
and
again.
But
it
seemed
that
the
cases,
arguments,
quotes
and
examples
were
just
overwhelming.
It
took
me
at
least
five
readings
of
that
paper
to
finally
have
a
faint
idea
of
how
a
case
brief
should
look
like.
That
is
the
just
the
beginning.
Once
we
started
to
actually
work
on
our
case,
we
found
out
that
dozing
off
in
class
was
really
not
a
good
thing.
The
case
involves
several
important
issues
concerning
the
Constitution.
In
order
to
support
our
argument,
we
have
to
know
what
the
Constitution
actually
says.
Superficially
knowing
what's
going
on
is
far
from
enough.
In
order
to
be
able
to
convince
a
judge
our
point
and
able
to
point
out
the
errors
in
our
opponent's
arguments,
we
have
to
master
the
material.
Voluntarily,
like
reviewing
for
a
final
exam(though
actually
there
was
no
final),
we
opened
the
text
book
and
read
word
by
word.
This
writing
experience
involved
a
tremendous
amount
of
outside
information.
Only
listing
the
main
issues
involved
in
the
case
is
far
from
enough.
One
of
the
most
important
technique
in
a
case
brief
is
to
cite
relevant
old
cases.
I
had
thought
that
the
professor
would
gave
us
a
list
of
cases
for
our
reference.
Instead,
what
was
given
to
us
was
Lexis-Nexus.
We
actually
went
into
the
database
to
make
the
search
ourselves.
This
is
one
of
the
hardest
part
in
the
whole
writing
experience.
It
is
a
constant
comparison
between
the
case
we
are
reading
from
the
computer
screen
and
the
case
we
have
in
hand.
While
reading
the
summaries,
several
issues
have
to
be
considered
before
we
can
make
a
decision
whether
to
read
the
whole
case
at
all.
First
of
all,
is
the
case
relevant
to
our
current
case?
Does
it
address
the
issues
we
want
to
address?
If
so,
does
it
work
for
our
side?
or
does
it
work
for
our
opponent.
For
those
cases
that
work
for
our
opponents,
we
still
have
to
study
them,
because
they
will
appear
in
their
case
brief
and
we
have
to
incorporate
in
ours
evidence
to
discredit
those
arguments.
The
actual
writing
process
after
all
the
information
gathering
took
several
nights.
The
four
of
us
were
on
one
team.
It
was
very
painful.
The
language
we
were
going
to
use
had
to
be
very
concise
and
poignant.
I
remember
we
spent
at
least
several
hours
just
trying
to
summarize
what
happened
in
the
case.
We
had
to
present
it
in
a
way
that
would
be
almost
"fat
free",
yet
at
the
same
time
retaining
the
basic
facts.
This
is
also
an
exercise
in
language.
In
the
summery
of
the
case
facts,
we
have
to
present
the
facts
such
that
it
will
work
for
our
argument
later
in
the
case
brief.
However,
this
manipulation
of
language
has
to
be
very
subtle.
Because
once
you
cross
the
line
and
the
reader
thinks
your
bend
the
truth,
you
lose
the
case.
The
heart
of
the
paper
is
the
arguments.
Not
only
do
we
have
to
come
up
with
a
decent
number
of
arguments
that
can
support
our
case,
but
we
also
have
to
find
an
internal
logic
that
will
link
these
arguments
into
an
integrated
case
brief.
We
struggled
with
different
arguments
to
prove
our
case,
constantly
negating
ourselves
and
coming
up
with
new
arguments.
We
had
to
remind
ourselves
from
time
to
time
the
logic
under
all
the
arguments
and
facts
we
had,
so
that
we
would
not
be
overwhelmed
by
the
materials
we
gathered.
Our
research
work
turned
out
to
be
pretty
good
and
we
had
several
cases
and
documents
that
would
solidly
prove
our
case.
However,
as
we
progressed,
we
sometimes
also
found
out
facts
and
cases
that
would
strike
us
dead.
Suddenly,
all
we
had
done
seemed
in
vain.
Because
black
and
white
in
that
book
it
says
just
the
opposite.
At
that
time,
it
seemed
the
mission
of
defending
that
case
was
just
impossible.
We
hoped
that
our
opponents
would
not
find
them,
only
to
realize
that
the
panel
of
judges
would
still
haunt
us
with
these
facts.
Only
then
did
we
realize
the
only
way
is
to
fact
them
and
try
to
come
up
with
answers.
That's
probably
the
essence
of
legal
writing.
During
those
writing
weeks,
the
case
brief
had
become
part
of
our
life.
From
the
point
of
writing
itself,
several
aspects
of
this
experience
proved
to
be
valuable.
First
of
all,
as
writers,
we
are
truly
keeping
our
readers
in
mind.
I
remember
that
whenever
I
wrote
something
in
high
school,
my
teacher
would
always
ask
me
to
think
about
who
would
read
my
writing
and
what
they
would
think
if
they
read
what
I
wrote.
I
never
felt
the
urgent
need
to
do
that.
However,
for
the
case
brief
writing,
this
had
become
one
of
our
biggest
concerns.
We
had
to
keep
in
mind
that
every
argument
we
wrote
would
be
under
the
scrutiny
of
our
opponents.
Any
mistakes
or
oversight
might
result
in
a
total
defeat
in
the
courtroom.
Therefore,
during
our
writing
process,
we
were
constantly
asking
ourselves
questions
such
as:
what
if
they
found
something
that
would
counter
this
argument.
At
the
same
time,
our
readers
also
includes
the
panel
that
is
going
to
decide
who
win
the
case.
Their
role
in
the
final
argument
will
be
reading
the
brief
and
asking
questions
that
they
think
the
brief
failed
to
answer.
The
brief
had
to
be
waterproof.
With
such
readership
in
mind,
our
writing
was
logical
and
every
single
claim
was
well
supported.
Though
it
took
several
times
the
effort
to
do
a
similar
length
paper
in
another
subject,
we
found
our
efforts
worthwhile.
The
second
valuable
aspect
of
this
experience
is
collaborative
work.
I
remember
when
we
had
to
do
collaborative
writing
before,
it
was
one
of
the
two
cases:
either
I
would
do
the
whole
thing
and
ask
my
partner
to
revise
it
or
we
divided
it
by
two
and
I
would
do
the
first
half
and
my
partner
would
do
the
second.
However,
for
this
writing
project,
it
seemed
that
neither
would
work.
First
of
all,
the
project
is
too
big
for
any
one
person
to
handle.
The
cases
were
divided
into
several
issues,
and
for
every
issue,
we
had
to
come
up
with
several
arguments.
What's
more
important
is
from
time
to
time,
one
just
feels
that
his
talent
is
exhausted
and
only
through
another
person's
mind
can
there
be
another
argument
to
support
the
case.
Secondly,
the
inner
logic
is
one
of
the
most
important
aspect
of
a
case
brief.
Artificially
separating
the
writing
task
would
result
in
a
paper
that
would
not
stand
scrutiny.
Therefore,
we
needed
true
collaboration:
We
roughly
divided
the
issues
among
the
four
of
us
and
each
one
went
out
to
find
cases
and
documents.
When
we
got
together
to
write
the
paper,
each
reported
what
he
had
found
and
what's
more
important,
described
to
the
group
the
whole
picture
of
the
issue
he
was
in
charge
of
so
that
everyone
else
would
get
a
view
of
that
aspect
of
the
case.
Then
together
we
tried
to
think
of
ways
to
support
our
case.
Collaborative
work
definitely
took
more
time,
but
it
did
gave
better
results.
Such
a
writing
experience
worked
well
for
us
in
the
final
oral
argument.
We
beat
our
opponents
in
every
one
of
the
four
issues
involved
in
the
case.
It
is
obvious
from
the
actual
argument
that
because
we
thought
actively
about
the
possible
reactions
from
our
opponent
and
the
judges,
we
were
prepared
for
their
questions
and
argument.
That
is
one
of
the
reasons
we
won.
