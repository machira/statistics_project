Literacy
Narrative
MOMMY.
DADDY.
ERICA.
BABY.
BOOK.
SCHOOL.
There
it
is.
I
believe
this
is
a
rather
accurate
sample
of
my
first
attempt
at
writing.
If
only
the
world
knew
the
time
and
effort
put
into
painstakingly
scrawling
such
a
masterpiece
on
my
little
blackboard
each
night.
In
reality,
only
my
two
parents
truly
understand.
When
I
explained
this
particular
summer
assignment
to
them,
they
immediately
laughed
and
reminded
me
of
how
I,
their
overly
ambitious
three
year
old,
would
insist
on
learning
and
writing
a
new
word
each
evening
before
bed.
I
would
write
and
re-write
the
same
words
until
I
was
positive
my
weary
parents
really
meant
it
when
they
insisted
I
was
doing
it
right.
(
I
may
have
been
only
three,
but
it
doesn't
take
much
to
know
when
parents
say
things
just
to
get
you
to
finally
lay
down!)
I
personally
do
not
remember
doing
any
such
thing
but,
as
usual,
am
outvoted
two-to-one.
I
suppose
it's
ironic
that
I
don't
remember
my
first
attempts
at
writing.
It
all
began
as
a
blur
and
as
far
as
I
can
tell
has
continued
in
the
same
manner
for
years.
In
my
opinion,
those
few
words
that
took
me
days
to
master
are
on
par
with
an
academic
college
paper
I
may
have
written
a
few
months
ago.
While
every
aspect
of
my
writing
has
changed
over
the
years,
I
see
my
attitudes
and
opinions
reflected
not
only
in
the
finished
product,
but
in
the
means
of
reaching
that
point,
and
that
is
one
thing
I
know
will
never
change.
I'd
like
to
think
my
writing
has
improved
since
I
was
three,
and
in
many
ways,
I
know
it
has.
On
the
other
hand,
I
can
still
see
the
little
girl
working
so
hard
and
being
so
determined
to
meet
the
expectations
I
think
others
have
of
me
and
reach
the
standards
I
have
of
myself.
At
the
time
I
began
to
learn
to
read
and
write,
I,
of
course,
thought
nothing
of
all
this
subconscious
thinking
and
analyzing.
I
was
content
to
practice
my
writing
by
copying
word
upon
word
from
any
book
I
could
get
my
hands
on.
Before
my
brother
was
bom,
I
used
to
sit
and
pore
over
baby
name
books
with
my
mom
and,
like
her,
copy
any
combination
of
names
onto
paper.
I'm
sure
she
was
trying
desperately
to
find
a
name
everyone
would
be
happy
with
before
this
baby
was
bom;
I
simply
did
what
Mommy
did
because
I
could.
Now
that
I
think
about
it,
that
has
always
been
a
good
enough
reason
to
do
anything:
because
I
could.
I
remember
in
kindergarten
I
was
so
proud
of
myself
because
I
could
read
Little
House
in
the
Big
Woods,
one
of
the
Laura
Ingalls
Wilder
books.
Of
course,
I
understood
little
of
it,
but
I
could
sound
out
the
big
words,
and
that
was
all
that
mattered.
There
was
also
the
fact
that
the
little
boy
down
the
street
could
barely
recognize
the
letters
of
the
alphabet.
But
that
wasn't
what
was
important
was
it?
Well
.
.
.
maybe.
We
used
to
play
school
in
his
sandbox,
and
I
would
trace
letters
in
the
sand
so
we
both
could
learn
together.
Perhaps
this
was
another
rather
unconventional
first
writing,
but
what
can
I
say?
I
wasn't
even
really
in
school
yet.
Once
I
was
in
first
grade,
things
became
a
bit
more
interesting.
I'm
haunted
to
this
day
by
those
awful
yellow
sheets
of
paper
we
were
forced
to
use
daily.
The
railroad
track
lines
on
the
paper
were
the
first
tiling
that
bothered
me
about
this
whole
process.
We
were
told
over
and
over
to
make
our
uppercase
letters
go
from
the
top
solid
line
to
the
bottom
one.
Our
lowercase
ones
were
allowed
to
reach
only
to
that
sacred
dotted
middle
line.
Who
knows
what
might
have
happened
if
we
strayed
from
these
carefully
set
boundaries.
Life
as
we
knew
it
would
have
ended,
I'm
sure.
Above
these
lines
was
that
terrible
blank
space
in
which
we
were
allowed
to
illustrate
our
wonderful
two-line
stories
with
a
picture
before
they
were
hung
on
the
wall
or
stamped
with
a
smiley
face
to
show
Mom
and
Dad.
I
don't
feel
it's
too
self-serving
to
say
I
think
I
have
succeeded
at
many
things
in
my
lifetime
because,
in
the
next
breath,
I
am
the
first
to
admit
that
drawing
was
never
one
of
them!
Along
with
these
first
school
writings
came
the
problems
of
the
pencil
and
the
left-handed
student.
It
was
never
a
question
of
trying
to
make
me
a
righty
as
was
done
when
my
parents
were
in
school.
I
have
always
been
a
definite
lefty
just
like
my
uncle
who
years
ago
had
his
knuckles
rapped
repeatedly
by
the
loving
sisters
in
his
Catholic
school
who
truly
believed
a
left-handed
child
was
sent
from
the
devil.
(That,
however,
would
be
an
entirely
different
story.)
It
was
the
pencil
that
I
had
problems
with.
I
was,
thankfully,
never
taught
to
hold
my
hand
and
paper
twisted
like
a
contortionist
as
most
lefties
were,
and,
as
a
result,
turned
in
many
slightly
smeared
yellow
composition
papers
and
went
home
daily
with
pencil
lead
covering
the
side
of
my
hand.
Despite
how
it
appears,
though,
I
don't
think
there
was
any
permanent
scarring,
and
through
it
all
I
managed
to
bring
home
a
few
Pulitzer
prize
winning
writings
that
remain
to
this
day
in
the
Erica
-
first
grade
box
buried
deep
in
storage.
It
was
a
move
in
second
grade
that
molded
my
next
few
years
of
writing.
I
should
probably
mention
that
during
this
time
I
was
in
Catholic
school
but
also
that
the
system
had
come
a
long
way
from
when
my
mom
and
left-handed
uncle
were
there.
It
was
here
I
was
first
allowed
to
write
in
pen
and
learned
cursive
writing
that
for
years
people
say
pegged
me
a
Catholic
school
girl.
The
railroad
track
lines
were
still
there,
but
they
were
on
white
paper
and
in
my
handwriting
book.
That
I
could
handle.
I
used
these
new
freedoms
and
skills
to
write
my
first
long
report
ever.
The
subject
was
koala
bears,
and
I
learned
a
new
word:
eucalyptus.
We
used
an
encyclopedia
to
help
us
and
thought
we'd
never
worked
so
hard
in
our
lives.
I'll
never
forget
I
got
an
A-plus
on
that
one-page
report
and
really
do
credit
my
second-grade
teacher
with
giving
me
a
boost
of
confidence
that
pushed
me
a
long
way
towards
what
I
do
today.
The
next
big
change
I
recall
was
not
until
after
we
moved
again
when
I
was
in
fourth
grade,
this
time
to
the
area
I
still
live
in
today.
I
was
introduced
to
the
world
of
power-writing.
We
wrote
powergraphs
instead
of
paragraphs,
and
it
all
seemed
quite
odd
to
me
for
years.
It
is
a
concept
that
I'm
sure
is
common
all
over,
but
it
sure
was
new
to
me.
Powerwriting
is
a
system
that
the
English
teachers
in
my
school
district
apparently
applauded
and,
over
the
years,
drilled
into
our
impressionable
young
minds.
It
followed
us
through
the
grades
so
that,
even
as
seniors
long
past
the
days
of
powergraphs,
we
would
still
joke
about
the
things
they
used
to
make
us
do.
This
is
probably
sounding
more
like
some
sort
of
medieval
torture
device
rather
than
a
logical
approach
to
teaching
students
to
write
properly.
Let
me
explain.
All
our
powergraphs
followed
patterns
such
as
1-2-2
or,
later,
1-2-3-2-3,
or,
if
you
were
really
advanced,
1-2-3-3-2-3-3.
It
was
simply
a
way
of
obeying
the
rules
that
each
paragraph
began
with
a
topic
sentence
and
was
followed
by
supporting
thoughts.
Powerwriting
was
certainly
not
a
new
concept,
but
who
else
was
ever
given
an
assignment
to
write
a
1-2-3-2-3
powergraphs
about
their
dog.
I
think
I
must
have
written
at
least
a
powergraph
a
day
for
years.
However,
while
we
complained
then
and
thought
our
teachers
simply
enjoyed
putting
us
through
such
torture,
I
can
look
back
now
and
finally
see
the
method
behind
the
madness.
It
is
rare
for
me
to
not
automatically
check
to
be
sure
each
paragraph
at
least
loosely
follows
guidelines
I
was
taught
seven
years
ago.
I
guess
that
makes
me
a
textbook
example
that
their
process
is
worthwhile,
but
I
can
handle
that
because
I
can
also
laugh
when
my
seventh-grade
sister
comes
home
complaining
about
teachers
and
powergraphs.
Although
it
may
appear
to
be
the
case,
powerwriting
did
not
entirely
consume
the
next
few
years
of
my
life.
My
teachers
were
also
quite
fond
of
oral
reports.
We
called
them
O.C.'s,
short
for
Oral
Communications
and
classified
as
either
informative,
persuasive,
or
entertaining.
Every
report
I
wrote
from
fourth
to
seventh
grade
was
accompanied
by
an
oral
presentation
with
visual
aids
of
all
sorts.
I
can
remember
several
book
reports
on
Newberry
Award
winning
books
when
my
fifth
grade
teacher
informed
us
we'd
be
reading
two
of
them
a
month.
I
debated
everything
from
what
the
United
States
should
do
to
help
third
world
countries
to
whether
or
not
we
should
be
allowed
to
sit
where
we
wanted
in
the
lunchroom.
I
taught
my
friends
how
to
make
a
bowtie
out
of
a
dollar
bill
and
how
to
make
edible
mudpie.
I
loved
standing
in
front
of
the
class
trying
to
impress
my
expertise
on
my
friends
and
classmates.
While
I'm
not
sure
my
friends
were
any
more
excited
about
my
stunning
presentations
than
I
was
of
theirs,
I
did
discover
a
few
interesting
bits
of
information
over
these
years.
The
ability
to
procrastinate
is
a
trait
I'm
certain
has
been
passed
down
through
my
family
for
generations.
I
found
by
doing
a
report
or
O.C.
a
month
for
almost
four
years
that
this
is
not
necessarily
a
fault.
I
could
not
begin
to
count
the
number
of
papers
I
have
began
less
than
two
days
before
the
deadline.
I
also
found
that
I
could
get
away
with
this
and
still
do
quite
well.
I
used
to
drive
my
parents
crazy
until
they
finally
realized
I
would
get
everything
done
on
time
and
let
me
stress
by
myself.
I
work
well
under
pressure
and
always
preferred
to
sit
and
spend
one
entire
day
writing
a
paper
rather
than
work
a
little
at
a
time.
The
day
has
yet
to
come
where
I
have
completely
stopped
doing
this.
I
guess
it's
true
that
old
habits
die
hard.
The
difference
now
is
that
I
know
when
I
can
get
away
with
it
and
when
it
just
won't
work.
My
history
class
in
eighth
grade
was
one
time
I
knew
from
the
start
I
couldn't
get
away
with
my
usual
system.
We
were
assigned
a
topic
by
the
teacher
to
research
and
later
report
what
we
learned.
We
were
studying
the
period
of
the
Revolutionary
War,
so
the
topics
were
such
things
as
the
Declaration
of
Independence
and
the
Bill
of
Rights.
I,
however,
was
assigned
the
XYZ
Affair,
a
little
known
incident
involving
three
men
who
travelled
to
France
attempting
to
negotiate
an
agreement
to
protect
U.S.
shipping.
Not
only
was
this
quite
possibly
the
least
exciting
topic
given;
there
was
almost
no
information
available
in
the
school
library
where
all
research
was
to
be
done.
Besides
this,
it
was
the
first
paper
any
of
us
had
ever
been
assigned
where
the
final
presentation
was
to
be
done
entirely
without
notecards.
We
were
allowed,
or
should
I
say
required,
to
use
any
visual
aids,
but
the
outlines
we
had
written
and
were
to
follow
sat
in
the
hands
of
our
teacher
throughout
our
presentation.
As
nerve-racking
as
it
was
in
eighth
grade,
everything
turned
out
well
in
the
end,
and
on
I
went
into
the
much
feared
ninth
grade
biology
world
of
bug
collections,
lab
reports,
and
the
dreaded
term
paper.
The
first
real
term
paper
I
ever
wrote
was
in
Mr.
Stevens'
biology
class.
I
admit
it
was
a
bit
of
a
shock
to
this
system
I'd
been
following
and
procrastination
threatened
to
catch
up
with
me.
It
was
a
long-term
assignment
to
research
a
topic
related
to
biology
and
write
a
ten-page
paper
on
our
findings.
Over
the
three
months,
there
were
a
few
deadlines
we
had
to
meet.
One
month,
we
just
had
to
tell
our
teacher
our
topic.
I
made
my
final
decision
as
the
words
came
out
of
my
mouth
when
he
called
my
name
in
class.
It
wasn't
that
I
didn't
try;
there
were
just
too
many
choices.
My
topic
was
the
systems
and
diagnosis
of
lupus.
The
next
month
we
had
to
show
the
teacher
at
least
three
sources
and
the
work
we
had
done
so
far.
I
checked
out
three
books
from
the
library
the
day
before
and
spent
half
the
night
taking
notes
on
them.
In
the
last
month,
I
pulled
my
act
together
and
finished
punching
out
the
last
words
of
my
ten-source
bibliography
on
our
old
electric
typewriter
two
days
before
the
paper
was
due.
I
ended
up
doing
quite
well
and
even
got
the
extra
credit
points
for
turning
it
in
early.
I
may
have
driven
myself
crazy
doing
this,
but
no
one
else
had
to
know.
Anyway,
it
was
the
end
result
that
mattered.
Tenth
grade
and
high
school
came
with
a
whole
new
set
of
teachers
and
expectations.
My
tenth
grade
teacher
had
us
write
reactions
to
what
we
read
or
discussed
in
class
several
times
a
week.
Often,
these
were
just
quick
freewriting
style
paragraphs
that
were
then
used
to
begin
the
discussion
for
the
next
day.
These
were
simple
and
didn't
require
too
much
deep
thinking.
What
was
interesting
was
that
he
collected
and
kept
these
for
awhile.
Every
so
often,
we
would
get
them
back
with
comments
and
had
to
use
these
papers
to
put
together
a
longer,
revised
answer
to
the
same
question.
Thanks
to
this
teacher,
the
idea
of
freewriting
was
not
new
to
me
by
the
time
I
reached
college.
It
was
something
I
had
automatically
been
doing
for
three
years.
Tenth
grade
was
also
the
year
I
wrote
my
first
and
only
play
of
my
life.
What
is
important
to
know
now
about
my
English
teacher
that
year
was
that
he
yelled
on
a
regular
basis
and
informed
us
that
we
knew
nothing
about
writing
or
literature.
He
enjoyed
criticizing
past
teacher
we
had
and
telling
us
they,
too,
knew
nothing
about
the
subjects
they
taught.
So
he
decided
to
make
it
his
personal
goal
to
teach
us
everything
he
knew,
which,
he
informed
us,
was
almost
everything.
That
said,
he
assigned
us
to
write
a
play.
That
was
it.
There
were
no
instruction,
no
guidelines.
We
were
given
one
week
and
a
ten-page
minimum.
Needless
to
say,
my
friends
and
I
were
all
rather
bitter
and
upset
by
the
whole
ordeal
and
spent
the
week
complaining
about
the
play
and
our
teacher
in
general.
However,
the
night
before
it
was
due
I
spent
at
my
best
friends
computer
making
up
what
I
still
think
was
the
worst
play
ever
written.
It
was
a
mystery
about
two
friends
who
were
kidnapped
and
held
for
ransom.
The
key
to
the
whole
plot
was
in
the
red
hat
the
one
girl
had
been
wearing.
It
like
everything
else
I
ever
did
in
school,
is
buried
in
a
box
somewhere
in
storage
where,
if
I
have
my
way,
it
will
stay
forever.
Our
real
shock
came
when
these
feeble
attempts
at
playwriting
were
returned
to
us.
The
average
grade
was
a
50%.
We
were
told
they
were
awful,
had
no
plots,
no
turning
points,
and
should
just
be
thrown
in
the
trash.
Incidentally,
some
were
thrown
away,
and
I
have
a
few
friends
who
never
saw
their
papers
again.
He
also
told
us
he
had
been
easy
in
grading
them,
and
we
should
be
thankful.
My
grade
was
an
eighty,
the
only
one
he
gave.
Go
figure!
Surprisingly
enough,
my
class
made
it
through
the
rest
of
tenth
grade.
The
following
year,
the
writing
I
most
remember
was
actually
in
French
class.
We
translated
a
children's
book,
and
I
used
one
that
had
been
a
favorite
as
long
as
I
could
remember:
The
Night
Before
Christmas.
For
this
project,
my
left-handed
uncle
came
in
handy;
he
also
happens
to
be
fluent
in
French
and
taught
it
for
years.
I
had
more
fun
with
that
assignment
than
any
I
could
think
of
in
years.
It
was
most
certainly
a
different
genre
than
what
I
was
used
to
writing.
Besides
that,
I
don't
remember
anything
all
that
memorable
that
year.
I
wrote
a
tediously
long
research
paper
on
Charlie
Chaplain
as
a
joint
history/English
project,
but
if
it
was
half
as
boring
to
write
about
now
as
it
was
to
do,
I
wouldn't
dream
of
ruining
anyone's
day
with
the
details.
Life
was
a
much
more
interesting
in
A.P.
English
senior
year.
My
teacher
that
year
was
also
our
yearbook
advisor
where
I
was
an
editor
and
one
of
the
best
teacher
I
ever
had.
It
is
because
of
her
that
I
really
felt
prepared
when
I
came
to
college.
For
the
first
time,
we
discussed
and
wrote
about
what
we
found
interesting
instead
of
listing
characters
and
taking
notes
on
plot
structure.
She
treated
my
class
like
adults
and
gave
us
enough
freedom
to
actually
write
for
ourselves.
At
the
same
time,
she
was
tough
on
us
and
critical
of
everything
we
put
on
paper.
It
was
perfect.
I
find
nothing
more
discouraging
than
if
I
get
a
paper
back
with
comments
like
fine
or
OK
.
If
I
have
taken
the
time
and
effort
to
write
something
I
might
be
satisfied
with
enough
for
someone
else
to
read,
I'd
rather
see
it
returned
covered
with
criticism
or
suggestions
and
know
that
someone
besides
me
cares.
I
did
well
in
that
class
because
I
worked
for
it.
To
receive
a
good
grade
or
comment
from
her
could
put
me
in
a
good
mood
for
the
day.
At
the
same
time,
I
wasn't
disappointed
if
I
didn't;
it
just
made
me
work
harder
the
next
time.
I
really
believe
that
people
will
try
harder
to
please
the
people
they
like
and
respect.
I
know
I
do.
Coming
to
Lafayette
was,
I
admit,
an
eye-opening
experience.
However,
it
was
not,
for
me,
the
shock
everyone
warns
you
about.
I
think
eighteen
years
of
living
and
almost
as
many
of
schooling
had
taught
me
that
I
could
handle
whatever
came
my
way.
My
First
Year
Seminar
and
professor
reminded
me
a
lot
of
my
senior
English
class
and
teacher.
The
difference
that
most
stands
out
in
my
mind
is
that
where
in
high
school
I
knew
there
was
so
much
I
could
improve,
in
college
I
had
to
actually
do
it.
I
had
always
revised
papers,
but
never
quite
as
much.
I
wrote
I
liked
criticism
but
thought
twice
about
such
a
remark
when
my
first
paper
seemed
to
have
more
of
the
professor's
thoughts
on
it
than
mine
and
the
grade
was
a
C-.
With
that
as
a
starting
point
I
was
sure
there
was
no
way
to
go
but
up,
and
by
the
end
of
the
semester,
the
A-
I
finally
ended
up
with
on
my
transcript
was
worth
more
to
me
than
any
other
grade.
It
wasn't
that
the
assignments
were
too
hard
or
even
that
I
often
put
things
off
until
the
last
minute.
I
always
knew
what
I
wanted
to
say;
the
problem
I
had
was
how
to
say
it.
Comparing
a
paper
I
wrote
only
a
year
ago
to
my
final
paper
first
semester,
there
is
no
denying
the
difference.
Coming
to
college
just
forced
me
to
try
to
make
that
change.
All
this
reflection
has
brought
me
almost
to
the
present.
I
choose
to
refrain
from
saying
much
about
English
class
second
semester
except
that
it
could
have
been
much,
much
better.
Maybe
I
was
spoiled
by
having
a
worthwhile
class
first
semester,
but
I
expected
a
lot
more
than
what
I
got.
That
said,
I
guess
I
am
at
the
present
and
the
end
of
this
particular
paper.
It
is
interesting
to
see
the
steps
I
have
taken
to
get
me
where
I
am
today,
and
through
it
all,
I
really
do
feel
like
the
same
little
girl
who
begged
to
learn
that
coveted
new
word
every
day.
I
may
look
a
bit
different
and
spit
words
out
on
my
computer
screen
now,
but
if
I
can
write
something
I'm
satisfied
with,
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
two
words
or
a
college
thesis
paper.
