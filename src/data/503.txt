My
Literacy
Narrative
Just
because
you
know
what
something
is
does
not
mean
you
like
it.
At
the
same
time,
just
because
you
do
not
like
something
does
not
mean
that
it
does
not
play
a
large
role
in
your
life.
This
idea
explains
my
relationship
with
writing
when
I
was
first
old
enough
to
understand
what
writing
was.
As
much
as
I
may
not
have
been
interested
in
writing,
my
writing
has
always
had
its
own
style;
a
style
that
has
evolved
with
my
writing
abilities.
The
first
thing
I
can
remember
writing
is
the
names
of
everyone
in
my
family.
My
favorite
names
to
write
were
my
sisterOs
and
my
own
because
they
had
NEOsO
in
them
(after
all,
as
far
as
I
knew
my
parentsO
given
names
were
Mommy
and
Daddy).
NEOsO
were
my
favorite
letter,
because
to
me
there
were
only
two
rules
for
writing
EOs:
they
were
always
capitalized,
and
there
were
as
many
lines
to
an
E
as
you
could
fit
between
the
top
and
the
bottom
lines.
Kindergarten
soon
taught
me
everyone
elseOs
rules
of
writing
an
E,
and
it
soon
became
time
for
my
writing
style
to
change
and
to
begin
first
grade.
My
writing
advanced
in
this
time
periodNI
was
writing
more
than
one
word
at
a
time,
but
not
by
much.
Once
a
week,
everyone
in
my
first
grade
class
had
a
chance
to
use
the
classroom
computer
on
their
own
to
write
a
short
story,
which
we
could
illustrate
at
the
end.
My
stories
went
something
like,
NI
like
dogs.
I
have
a
dog.
His
name
is
Snookie.
The
End.O
My
accompanying
illustrations
however,
were
quite
detailed.
I
could
articulate
a
much
more
detailed
story,
but
I
did
not
have
the
patience
to
sit
down
and
write
it,
I
suppose.
To
me,
that
was
what
the
illustrations
were
forNto
really
explain
the
stories.
That
was
how
my
writing
style
changed
in
first
gradeNone
word
to
one
sentence,
with
the
most
important
details
in
my
illustrations.
Over
that
summer,
my
older
sister
and
I
began
writing
short
stories
togetherNshe
wrote
and
I
illustrated.
The
stories
were
very
creative
all
around!
Second
grade
began,
with
the
teacher
that
everyone
said
was
very
tough.
She
seemed
very
nice
to
me,
until
she
told
us
that
by
the
end
of
the
school
year
we
would
each
be
responsible
for
writing
our
own
story.
Surprisingly,
by
the
time
the
end
of
the
year
came
around,
I
wanted
to
write
this
story.
When
it
was
time
to
write
my
story,
I
was
so
excited
that
I
got
to
illustrate
and
write
the
story
entirely
on
my
own.
Not
only
that,
but
it
was
just
like
a
Nbig
personO
story
because
I
got
to
write
my
final
draft
with
a
pen.
Mrs.
Schechter
had
made
learning
fun,
and
I
learned
that
that
was
the
key
to
my
newfound
interest
in
writingNit
had
to
be
fun.
When
I
look
back
now,
this
was
the
turning
point
in
my
writing.
I
still
had
my
own
style,
but
it
was
now
becoming
a
style
with
some
character.
That
summer
when
my
sister
and
I
wrote
stories,
we
took
turns
making
up
the
sentences.
Over
the
next
few
years
in
school,
my
writing
(as
well
as
my
interests
in
general)
continued
to
expand.
I
feel
that
these
few
years
were
crucial
to
my
development
as
a
writer,
because
this
is
when
I
started
to
feel
most
like
a
writer.
When
I
wrote
anything,
I
was
using
pens
(even
if
they
were
erasable)
instead
of
pencils,
which
meant
my
work
was
more
permanent,
more
lasting.
At
the
same
time,
I
was
required
to
use
cursive
writingNthe
writing
I
saw
so
many
adults
useNand
even
to
help
teach
my
struggling
classmates
how
to
write
in
such
a
manner
because
my
teacher
was
admittedly
horrible
at
cursive
writing.
Furthermore,
towards
the
end
of
fifth
grade,
my
teacher
mentioned
to
us
that
all
of
the
writing
we
had
done
and
submitted
to
our
folder
(everything
that
we
were
able
to
look
at
and
reminisce
upon
while
she
told
us
this
information)
was
going
to
be
sent
to
the
Middle
School
with
us
for
the
upcoming
fall,
and
that
this
folder
would
go
to
each
of
our
English
teachers
until
the
day
we
graduated
high
school,
when
it
would
be
returned
to
us.
I
remember
feeling
intimidated
by
this
information
because
I
understood
that
any
of
my
teachers
would
be
able
to
see
my
writing,
and
I
felt
a
sense
of
self-encouragement
to
try
my
hardest
so
that
my
teachers
would
be
impressed
by
my
work
over
the
years,
rather
than
expressing
any
other
sentiment
in
review
of
my
work.
Most
importantly,
as
the
teachers
began
to
expect
more
of
us,
I
began
to
expect
even
more
of
myself.
My
first
opportunity
to
demonstrate
my
new
expectations
of
myself
came
in
seventh
grade,
in
the
form
of
a
research
paper.
The
comfort
here
came
in
knowing
that
the
paper
would
be
on
Thomas
Jefferson
and
the
Declaration
of
IndependenceNone
of
my
favorite
topics
at
the
time
and
something
I
knew
a
lot
about,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
I
would
get
to
illustrate
what
I
wrote
(I
said
that
my
writing
style
had
advanced,
not
that
it
changed
all
together).
I
enjoyed
writing
this
paper
because
I
learned
a
lot
of
information
and
I
got
to
pretend
I
was
Thomas
Jefferson.
In
other
words,
I
did
not
feel
like
I
was
merely
writing
an
informative
paper,
but
that
I
was
expressing
myself
in
a
new
way,
and
I
loved
it.
The
day
before
our
papers
were
returned
to
us,
my
teacher
asked
me
to
come
see
him
during
extra
help.
Quite
nervous,
I
went,
and
Mr.
Hayden
told
me
that
both
he
(my
Social
Studies
teacher)
and
the
seventh
grade
English
teachers
were
so
impressed
by
my
paper
that
they
wanted
me
to
be
Thomas
Jefferson
in
a
mock
meeting
of
Congress.
When
I
got
my
paper
back
the
next
day,
I
saw
a
large,
red,
100%
at
the
end,
with
no
corrective
comments.
Instead,
the
teachersO
commentsNboth
my
Social
Studies
and
my
English
teachersO
commentsNwere
finally
and
completely
laudatory
instead
of
being
critical.
My
English
teacher
that
year
encouraged
me
to
do
some
writing
on
my
own.
She
said
I
should
write
about
anything
that
interested
me,
anything
that
I
was
feeling,
and
in
any
style.
I
had
already
told
her
that
I
kept
a
journal,
but
that
everything
was
expressed
through
sketches.
She
suggested
that
I
continue
to
draw,
but
that
I
should
illustrate
what
I
wrote
so
that
I
could
express
myself
in
numerous
ways.
By
mid-year,
my
first
haiku
poem
was
selected
to
be
in
the
Anthology
of
Poetry
by
Young
Americans.
I
had
written
a
few
poems
that
I
liked,
and
picked
the
one
that
I
thought
sounded
the
most
mature
because
I
thought
that
was
what
the
Anthology
was
looking
for.
Luckily,
the
editors
picked
the
same
poem,
and
I
was
published!
I
think
the
most
important
contribution
to
my
continued
change
in
writing
style
this
particular
year
was
a
product
of
greater
self-confidence,
and
my
desire
to
emulate
my
sister.
She
loved
to
write,
and
was
the
editor-in-chief
of
the
high
school
literary
arts
magazine
and
the
newspaper.
I
remember
her
interviewing
our
United
States
congressman,
Peter
King,
on
my
birthday,
and
I
was
not
angry
that
she
was
not
home,
but
jealous
because
I
liked
history
and
politics,
and
I
wanted
to
be
able
to
do
that
some
day.
That
summer
I
continued
to
write,
but
this
time
I
was
not
writing
short
stories.
I
started
my
own
notebook
of
poems,
which
I
used
to
express
my
feelings
instead
of
pictures
(although
I
still
illustrated
some
of
my
and
my
sisterOs
poems).
Eighth
grade
awarded
me
my
favorite
teacher
of
all
times
(my
Social
Studies
teacher
that
year),
learning
in
depth
about
the
Civil
WarNwhat
came
to
be
my
favorite
time
period
in
history,
and
a
real
love
for
writing.
Just
after
Christmas
and
New
YearOs,
we
were
assigned
to
groups
in
our
Social
Studies
class,
each
of
which
had
a
month
to
work
on
a
biography
of
their
chosen
President,
to
be
eight
pages
in
length.
Perhaps
it
was
a
combination
of
being
a
part
of
a
group
that
wanted
to
do
the
bare
minimum
of
work,
if
they
chose
to
do
any
at
all,
and
the
enormous
crush
I
had
on
my
teacher
that
pushed
me
to
write
this
paper
on
my
own.
Somehow,
I
handed
in
a
25
page
paper
on
Abraham
Lincoln,
(life-size)
illustrations
included,
that
he
still
uses
as
a
model
for
his
classes.
In
another
couple
of
weeks,
I
used
all
the
information
I
learned
while
doing
the
research
for
the
paper
to
write
a
poem
about
Lincoln.
My
Social
Studies
teacher
submitted
my
poem
to
the
high
school
literary
arts
magazine,
where
it
was
accepted
and
selected
to
be
the
Nfeature
poem.O
I
was
beginning
to
see
myself
grow,
just
in
time
to
begin
high
schoolNa
high
school
where
NLittle
LutzO
would
have
the
reputation
of
her
sister
to
uphold;
it
was
perfect
timing.
Over
the
course
of
my
four
years
in
high
school,
English
remained
my
favorite
class
and
my
favorite
subject
(well,
next
to
band).
This
was
the
class
that
made
a
bad
day
good
and
a
good
day
better.
In
English,
I
was
always
able
to
truly
express
myself
and
challenge
myself
equally.
When
senior
year
came
around
and
brought
with
it
AP
English,
I
was
in
all
my
glory,
and
finally
was
not
nervous
for
an
AP
exam.
As
it
turns
out,
I
was
not
the
only
one
who
acknowledged
my
efforts
over
the
past
13
years
or
so.
June
2,
2003
marked
the
eighth
straight
year
that
the
family
received
the
English
Achievement
Award.
In
fact,
the
writing
abilities
I
had
obtained
over
the
years
had
extended
to
Spanish,
where
I
received
recognition
for
my
achievements
as
well.
Most
importantly,
I
was
recognized
for
my
achievements
and
not
the
achievements
of
another
by
my
AP
English
teacher.
This
was
a
sense
of
accomplishment
like
no
other
I
had
gotten
to
experience
yet.
As
an
afterward,
something
that
makes
this
even
sweeter
is
that
my
AP
English
teacher,
Mr.
Steven
Bongiovi,
was
the
2005
New
York
State
Teacher
of
the
Year.
Even
with
all
the
improvements
and
maturation
I
had
gone
through
since
the
days
of
the
NEOsO,
I
did
not
feel
entirely
ready
for
college
writing.
Everyone
I
had
talked
to,
and
what
I
knew
from
talking
to
my
sister
about
the
work
she
was
doing
in
college
made
the
writing
requirements
of
college
seem
unmanageable.
However,
once
college
was
underway
it
did
not
seem
this
like
the
demon
I
had
expected
it
to
be.
I
was
expected
to
do
a
lot
more
writing
than
I
had
ever
had
to
do
before,
but
it
was
never
too
much
to
handle
(granted,
I
did
not
leave
it
to
the
night
before
it
was
due).
After
three
years,
I
am
used
to
it
and
am
sometimes
surprised
at
how
second-nature
it
feels.
I
appreciate
the
effort
it
has
taken
to
succeed.
My
friends
(and
sometimes
even
my
mom)
ask
me
to
write
formal
letters
and
emails
for
them
because
they
admire
how
easily
it
seems
I
am
able
to
write
them.
All
in
all,
college
has
provided
me
with
the
best
and
worst
experiences
I
have
encountered
in
my
career
as
a
writer:
lab
reports.
Lab
reports
are
the
most
abundant
of
the
papers
I
have
written
in
college,
and
also
the
most
structured.
Often,
this
is
incredibly
frustrating
to
me,
because
this
is
not
the
style
I
came
to
be
accustomed
to
or
comfortable
with
over
the
years.
I
am
not
able
to
express
myself
the
way
I
want
to,
or
write
as
much
as
I
would
like.
At
the
same
time,
it
has
taught
me
how
to
limit
my
words
when
necessary
and
how
to
follow
precisely
structured
guidelines.
After
all,
that
is
what
college
is
aboutNthe
learning
experiences.
For
about
17
years,
my
writing
style
and
the
maturity
that
it
has
displayed,
has
mirrored
my
growth
and
maturation
as
an
individual.
I
find
it
very
rewarding
and
helpful
to
explore
tangible
ways
that
showcase
my
development.
In
much
the
same
way,
being
a
writer
has
become
a
large
part
of
who
I
amNboth
in
the
sense
of
personal
accomplishments,
as
well
as
who
I
am
to
others.
I
am
a
college
student.
I
am
a
science
major.
I
am
a
writer.
The
End.
