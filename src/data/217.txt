WA
Summer
Writing
8/10/99
A
Work
in
Progress
I
must
be
honest;
honesty
is
always
a
good
friend
to
start
with
and
so
we'll
commence
at
her
front
door.
To
whom
it
may
concern:
the
assignment
of
a
seven-page
paper
detailing
my
adventures
and
exploits
as
a
writer
was
perhaps
the
least
appealing
of
my
summer
pass-time
choices,
and
even
as
I
sit
here
typing
my
thoughts
are
tiptoeing
back
to
the
Tom
Chapin
concert
I
just
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying.
Nevertheless,
I've
always
considered
myself
a
person
who
can
make
the
best
of
most
situations,
so
I
decided
earlier
thi
s
evening
that
I'd
do
some
hardcore
reflecting
and
turn
this
into
a
worthwhile
experience.
Besides,
I
have
about
four
days
before
I
return
to
Lafayette
for
RA
training
and
I
doubt
that
will
afford
me
much
time
to
breathe
much
less
ponder
the
nature
of
my
past
and
future
as
a
scribe;
I
suppose
summer's
humid
rays
are
beginning
to
fade
for
me
already....
I
do
some
of
my
best
pensive
work
while
snuggling
with
my
journal,
so,
as
no
specific
or
formal
outline
was
suggested
in
the
paper
description,
I
think
I'll
be
as
loose
and
personable
as
possible.
At
this
point,
my
life
as
a
writer
has
dwindled
down
to
these
habitual
confessions,
the
pretty
poems
and
short
stories
of
high-school
years
long
since
sacrificed
to
the
higher
education
gods.
Yes,
sadly,
I
too
fell
victim
to
the
torrential
downpour
of
papers
and
reading
assignments
college
has
to
offer.
I
became
aware
of
my
situation
earlier
this
year
as
I
thought
to
myself
how
long
it
had
been
since
a
poem
had
dripped
from
my
pen.
I
was
always
told
by
my
father
that
writing
requires
practice.
At
age
fourteen,
when
words
woke
me
up
every
night
at
3,
clamoring
to
find
their
way
from
brain
to
paper,
this
seemed
insignificant
advice.
Now
I
realize
that,
just
as
I
cannot
run
my
normal
six
miles
after
taking
a
two-week
vacation,
I
also
cannot
expect
myself
to
write
a
decent
work
of
fiction
without
a
bit
of
rehearsal.
Lafayette
has
certainly
honed
my
research
paper
writing
abilities,
but
I
find
my
recent
collection
severely
lacking
in
light
prose
and
verse.
Alas
and
alack,
this
is
a
condition
that
I
hope
to
remedy.
In
my
day,
I
was
considered
a
young
writer
of
promise
and
potential,
lacking
in
polish
but
with
many
years
of
creative
writing
ahead.
I
hope
to
once
again
release
the
steady
stream
of
ideas
that
once
threatened
to
flood
the
basement
of
my
mind,
meanwhile
infusing
as
much
creativity
as
possible
into
my
papers
on
Czechoslovakian
foreign
policy
and
French
history
and
culture.
My
senior
year
in
high
school
was
similarly
fact-based,
as
I
spent
most
of
my
time
revamping
the
school
newspaper.
I
suppose,
however,
that
it
is
most
efficient
to
begin
at
the
beginning,
and
if
we
are
going
to
do
it
that
way
it
all
comes
back
to
Buttons
and
Rusty.
Ah
yes,
Buttons
and
Rustv.
that
second-grade
masterpiece
of
bygone
years.
Marshall
Street
Elementary
School
bore
witness
to
my
early
greatness
in
animal
form,
as
my
second
grade
teacher
Mrs.
Bloomenstock
had
our
class
write
our
very
own
stories.
An
avid
fan
of
horses,
I
resolved
to
pen
a
little
history
of
the
one
and
only
horse
I
had
ever
ridden
-
White
Knight.
Of
course,
I've
been
told
multiple
times
afterwards
that
he
was
a
scrawny
little
pony
I
sat
on
after
hours
in
line
at
the
World's
Fair
in
North
Carolina,
but
in
my
mind,
that
noble
white
steed
was
(and
still
is)
the
most
handsome,
courageous,
gentle
yet
fiercely
loyal
companion
a
girl
could
ever
hope
for.
I
was
ready
to
tell
the
world
about
him!
That
is,
until
Kristen,
the
girl
I
thought
was
my
best
friend
got
to
Bloomenstock
first
and
undermined
my
inspiration
by
deciding
to
write
about
some
horse
she
claims
to
have
sat
on
once
somewhere.
I
doubt
she
even
got
to
hold
the
reins...Of
course,
I'm
over
it
now
but,
at
the
time,
it
was
quite
a
crushing
blow
to
find
that
someone
else
had
stolen
the
horse
story
monopoly.
Nonetheless,
I
quickly
resolved
to
rebound
with
an
even
better
tale.
Enter
Buttons
and
Rustv.
the
story
of
two
stray
pets
who
befriend
each
other
while
searching
for
food
and
kind
owners.
It
may
seem
like
your
typical
children's
tale,
but
Buttons
and
Rustv
was
different.
A
great
divide
separated
the
two
good
friends,
that
ancient
gulf
created
not
by
class
or
culture,
race
or
creed,
but
species.
Yes,
shockingly,
Buttons
was
a
cat
and
Rusty
a
dog,
but
through
it
all,
they
managed
to
forge
a
friendship
that
defied
the
pet
kingdom's
norms.
Profound,
I
know;
and
this
was
just
the
beginning!
It
was
the
tradition
at
Marshall
Street
for
one
student
from
each
grade
to
read
to
principle
of
the
school,
Ms.
Kelly,
every
month.
To
be
chosen
was
an
honor
coveted
by
many
and
an
undertaking
feared
by
even
more.
Weeks
of
practice
after
school
were
required
and,
if
one
was
lucky
enough
to
read
their
own
work,
they
got
to
make
their
own
hardcover
book
with
wallpaper-covered
cardboard
binding
and
everything.
My
little
story
was
deemed
worthy
to
represent
the
entire
second
grade
at
this
monthly
ordeal,
and
I
set
to
work
binding
my
book
and
polishing
my
reading
voice.
I
don't
actually
remember
how
the
reading
part
went,
but
this
recognition
of
my
writing
set
some
wheels
to
turning;
perhaps
I'd
be
a
novelist
as
well
as
a
cowgirl,
doctor,
astronaut,
horse
trainer,
teacher,
and
veterinarian.
My
elementary
school
career
progressed
steadily
as
I
moved
from
Norristown
to
Mont
Clare
in
third
grade,
but
it
wasn't
until
sixth
grade
that
my
writing
really
began
to
take
off.
Middle
School
itself
was
a
huge
transition,
but
one
of
the
best
parts
of
being
in
the
big
school
(next
to
lockers
and
homeroom,
naturally)
was
my
Language
Arts
teacher,
Mr.
DeAngelo.
After
a
year
of
experimentation
with
cool
things
like
metaphor
and
personification,
I
was
given
the
Writer
of
the
Year
award
for
my
sixth
grade
class.
The
year
had
seemed
successful
and
enjoyable
up
to
that
point;
after
then,
I
realized
that
it
had
served
as
a
fantastic
stepping
stone.
Mr.
D.
had
been
supportive
of
me
the
entire
year,
taking
an
interest
in
the
myths
and
poems
that
fell
from
my
pen.
To
me,
the
works
seemed
average,
but
Mr.
D.
must
have
seen
something
I
did
not.
He
actively
engaged
me
in
the
joy
of
writing...
and
revising,
and
re-writing
(actually,
I
have
yet
to
discover
the
joy
in
the
latter
two
tasks,
but
the
march
goes
on...).
After
Mr.
D.
took
an
interest
in
my
so-called
talent,
writing
developed
a
whole
new
appeal.
Hey,
I
thought
to
myself,
I
could
get
used
to
little
plaques
with
my
name
on
them.
At
age
twelve,
I
actually
started
to
think
of
myself
as
a
writer
Seventh
grade
brought
boys,
frog
dissections,
and
Mrs.
Campbell.
A
matronly
woman
with
a
mop
of
curly
brown
hair
and
a
huge
mole
that
dwarfed
one
of
her
perpetually
pink
cheeks,
she
always
seemed
larger
than
life
to
me.
Her
laugh,
her
excited
voice,
her
concern
-
all
were
exaggerated
to
almost
comic
proportions.
Despite
her
dramatic
appearance,
however,
Mrs.
Campbell's
place
in
my
life
will
forever
be
reserved
as
the
one
who
got
me
out
there,
and,
yes,
the
one
who
stemmed
my
exponentially
growing
ego.
She
apparently
picked
up
on
whatever
it
was
that
Mr.
D.
had
sensed
in
me
and
began
firing
extra
poetry
assignments
as
me
from
the
get-go.
She
saw
that
writing
came
easily
to
me,
as
I
tossed
off
short
stories
in
homeroom
and
snuck
books
into
class
to
read
while
everyone
else
worked
diligently
on
their
time
machine
narratives.
Instead
of
reprimanding
me,
however,
she
took
me
on
as
her
pupil
and
began
entering
my
poems
into
local
contests.
I
won
recognition
in
several
papers
and
was
appropriately
excited
when
one
of
my
poems
was
published
in
an
anthology
of
American
students,
but
it
wasn't
until
I
won
a
$25
grand
prize
from
the
Women's
Club
of
Royersford
that
I
began
to
take
the
competitions
seriously.
Soon
after,
I
accepted
Mrs.
Campbell's
offer
to
enter
me
in
an
oral
communications
contest
for
the
Optimist
Club
(yes,
such
a
thing
exists,
it
seems),
but
not
without
some
measure
of
hesitation.
Never
before
had
I
written
and
delivered
a
speech
on
my
own,
much
less
a
timed
and
judged
presentation
touting
the
benefits
of
optimism!
I
had
previously
stuck
to
my
accustomed
route
of
pretty
fantasy
and
nature
tales,
but
this
woman
wanted
me
to
delve
into
comedy
and
persuasion!
I
thought
she
was
insane
and
I
even
resented
her
for
trying
to
change
my
style
.
Be
that
as
it
may,
it
was
Campbell
who
quelled
my
fears
and
urged
me
to
compete,
so,
after
months
of
preparation
lead
to
a
silver
medal,
it
was
Campbell
who
earned
my
gratitude.
By
encouraging
me
to
broaden
my
scope
and
write
what
didn't
come
easily,
she
helped
me
to
grow
in
ways
I
am
only
beginning
to
realize.
I
continued
to
enter
contests
and
have
fun
with
my
paper
assignments
through
the
next
few
years,
always
relishing
the
first
few
weeks
of
school
when
my
English
teacher
for
that
term
would
be
clueless
and
give
me
easy
writing
work
and
lavish
grades.
High
school
rolled
around
with
all
the
fluidity
of
Route
22
during
construction,
but
by
eleventh
grade
I
was
pretty
well
settled
into
my
surroundings
and
secure
in
my
identity
(well,
kind
of...).
I
had
been
writing
for
the
school
newspaper,
the
Rampage,
since
eighth
grade
and
was
complacently
enjoying
my
position
as
a
staff
writer
and
sometime
photographer
when
ambition
hit
me
right
smack
in
the
face.
I
started
to
notice
the
disorganization
and
injustice
inherent
in
the
student-run,
faculty-oppressed
system.
I
asked
for
more
demanding
article
assignments
and
became
committed
to
publishing
at
least
one
kernel
of
interesting
information
within
that
paper's
leaves.
Then,
my
junior
year
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Giambrone,
decided
to
take
hold
of
my
fate
and
throw
me
headlong
into
the
journalistic
arena
by
suggesting
to
the
paper's
faculty
advisor
that
I
become
the
next
year's
editor
in
chief.
I
was
called
to
Mrs.
Pupo's
homeroom
one
gloomy
February
morning,
where
she
and
the
current
editor
offered
me
the
job,
looking
not
unlike
a
pair
of
jackals
waiting
to
fall
upon
their
prey.
I
knew
it
would
be
a
terrible
time
commitment,
and
my
friends
called
my
crazy
for
sacrificing
the
fun
of
my
senior
year
for
the
Rampage,
but
I
couldn't
deny
the
chance
to
turn
that
paper
upside
down!
My
senior
year
was
saturated
with
other
activities,
of
course
-
my
job,
other
clubs,
horseback
riding,
my
boyfriend;
but
the
Rampage
ran
my
life
otherwise.
A
child
of
the
computer
age,
I
knew
just
enough
technical
stuff
to
get
by,
mostly
typing
papers
on
our
ancient
AT&T
computer
at
home.
However,
when
I
realized
that
the
paper's
layout
was
still
done
using
glue
and
scissors,
and
that
the
editors
for
each
section
had
to
type
each
article
in
the
computer
themselves,
I
thought
to
myself
that
something
was
horribly
wrong.
How,
I
asked
myself,
could
a
school
district
with
such
high
taxes
have
a
newspaper
staff
that
was
still
cutting
and
pasting?
Thus
began
my
crusade
to
efficiently
computerize
the
paper.
Along
the
way,
I
tried
my
best
to
infuse
as
much
controversy
as
possible
into
the
publication,
landing
me
in
the
principle's
office
countless
times.
Perhaps
one
of
the
most
important
lessons
I
learned
from
that
experience
(besides
how
to
organize
an
entire
year,
plan
and
run
meetings,
fight
for
free
speech
and
honesty
in
the
face
of
a
disgustingly
conservative
administration,
and
negotiate
what
got
printed
and
what
did
not)
was
that
not
everyone
is
a
competent
writer.
The
first
edition's
rough
drafts
very
nearly
caused
me
to
break
down.
Since
I
had
conducted
try-outs
of
a
sort
and
had
picked
the
staff
myself,
and
since
membership
was
completely
voluntary,
I
thought
I'd
have
a
group
of
writers
that
loved
to
write
-or
were
at
least
good
at
writing.
I
assumed
that
most
of
the
articles
would
at
least
be
written
in
the
third
person
inverted
triangle
format,
with
quotes
credited
to
the
proper
people
and
paragraphs
longer
than
a
sentence.
I
was
horribly
mistaken.
I
was
appalled
at
the
sight
of
so
many
poorly
composed
articles;
I
had
no
idea
that
the
concept
of
a
well-organized,
five-point
essay
(or
inverted
pyramid-style
article,
for
that
matter)
was
so
foreign
to
most
students
my
age!
I
was
discouraged
at
first,
and
ended
up
simply
rewriting
most
of
the
thirty-something
articles
in
that
edition.
I
turned
to
my
father
in
tears
that
night,
and
it
was
then
that
I
received
some
valuable
advice:
it
never
pays
to
do
someone
else's
work
for
them.
My
dad
assured
me
that
I
didn't
have
to
re-write
the
articles,
just
hand
them
back
with
comments
and
perhaps
hold
general
conferences
on
basic
writing
skills
for
those
who
cared
enough.
It's
their
paper
too,
he
said,
and
they'll
have
to
put
their
name
on
it
eventually.
If,
after
all
your
suggestions
and
editing
and
effort,
it
sucks,
it's
not
your
problem.
I
had
a
revelation:
I
realized
that
none
of
these
people
were
benefiting
from
my
handholding.
When
I
finally
started
conversing
with
my
reporters
about
their
strengths
and
weaknesses,
I
was
rewarded
not
only
with
better
articles,
but
appreciation
when
their
newly
found
skills
were
applied
in
the
classroom.
I
truly
enjoyed
the
editing
process,
the
feeling
of
accomplishment
when
looking
at
a
finished
writing
product
that
I
had
helped
to
create.
Harsh
advice
it
may
seem,
but
Dad's
words
got
me
through
my
senior
year
and
I
can
proudly
say
that
1997-98
was
the
Rampage's
most
successful
and
groundbreaking
year.
I
don't
regret
accepting
Mrs.
Pupo's
challenge
for
a
moment.
As
a
first-year
student,
I
was
excited
to
discover
the
WA
program
upon
first
arriving
at
Lafayette.
Although
I
had
always
considered
writing
to
be
one
of
my
strongest
assets,
the
opportunity
to
share
my
work
with
a
student
more
experienced
than
I
in
the
ways
of
college
writing
seemed
invaluable.
However,
after
an
unimpressive
experience
with
the
WA
assigned
to
my
First
Year
Seminar
class
and
multiple
hours
spent
helping
to
revise
my
dorm-mates'
papers,
I
decided
that
perhaps
I
myself
would
be
able
to
help
other
students
with
their
writing.
Freshman
year
was
a
humbling
yet
positive
experience
for
me.
My
FYS,
International
Conflict
and
Cooperation,
was
fantastic
save
the
WA.
The
writing
assignments
I
received
throughout
the
year
were
challenging
but
not
unreasonable,
and
I
feel
that
my
writing
progressed
steadily
from
one
semester
to
the
next.
Hopefully,
therefore,
I've
come
far
enough
in
my
life
as
a
writer
to
handle
the
responsibilities
I
will
be
faced
with
as
I
hurtle
toward
my
sophomore
year
as
an
RA,
WA,
and
research
assistant.
If
not,
well,
then
I
guess
I'm
in
trouble,
but
who
knows
what
invaluable
lessons
lie
in
wait
for
me
in
this
my
most
challenging
year
as
a
writer.
For
now,
though,
I'm
off
to
enjoy
the
