Writing
as
a
WA
Summer
2005
AWA:
A
New
Era
in
Writing
I
suppose
that
if
the
history
of
man
can
be
divided
into
Before
and
After
the
Common
Era
(or
Christ,
depending
on
your
preference),
then
my
own
personal
history
of
a
writer
during
the
past
year
must
similarly
be
separated:
Before
and
After
Becoming
a
WA
(BWA
and
AWA).
I
completed
this
assignment
last
year
detailing
various
anecdotes
of
my
development
as
a
writer
from
Tom
the
Turkey,
my
first
work,
written
and
illustrated
on
my
grandfatherOs
monogrammed
stationary,
up
to
and
including
the
infamous
Five
Paragraph
Essay
of
the
horrible
era
called
junior
high.
First
year
writing
at
Lafayette
hadnOt
drastically
altered
my
world
(sorry),
and
I
was
basically
the
same
writer
that
I
had
been
in
high
school.
Becoming
a
WA,
however,
gave
me
quite
a
different
perspective
on
reading,
writing,
and
the
importance
of
punctuality,
and
this
is
why
I
must
now
detail
my
life
After
Becoming
a
WA.
After
spending
my
first
year
of
college
as
an
ambitious
Spanish
and
International
Affairs
dual
major,
I
finally
realized
that
while
the
goings-on
of
the
world
interest
me,
the
ins
and
outs
of
when
the
Mongols
raided
Pakistan
for
the
156th
time
didnOt
quite
peak
my
interest;
needless
to
say,
once
I
figured
out
that
I
could
suffice
my
need
for
world
news
on
CNN.com,
I
quickly
dropped
the
IA
major
and
retreated
back
into
my
happy
world
of
Espaol.
Something
was
still
missing
thoughNI
missed
reading
and
writing!
I
was
inundated
with
reading
material
and
writing
assignments
in
my
Spanish
classes,
of
course,
but
thereOs
something
about
opening
a
brand
new
Hemingway
novel
and
feeling
excitement
about
running
my
pen
over
its
crisp
white
pages
that
is
irreplaceable
for
me.
My
love
of
Spanish
springs
directly
from
my
passion
for
my
own
language,
and
once
I
became
aware
of
this
I
made
my
decision
to
become
a
double
major
again,
but
this
time
in
Spanish
and
English.
The
day
I
became
an
English
major
was
one
of
those
days
that
my
soul
was
just
happy,
and
thatOs
the
only
way
I
can
describe
it.
My
writing
took
a
huge
turn
after
I
came
to
terms
with
my
literary
self
and
began
taking
classes
in
which
I
didnOt
want
to
gouge
out
my
eyes.
I
genuinely
loved
my
English
classes
and
as
a
result,
my
writing
became
more
authentic.
Professor
Cefalu,
in
his
Literary
Questions
class,
encouraged
us
to
apply
any
school
of
literary
criticism
to
Joseph
ConradOs
The
Heart
of
Darkness,
and
although
Conrad
wasnOt
particularly
known
for
his
feminism
(!),
I
chose
to
illuminate
the
work
through
a
feminist
lens.
This
assignment
challenged
me
to
combine
my
own
interpretation
of
a
text,
which
I
had
done
dozens
of
times,
with
a
methodical,
disciplined
approach
that
has
existed
for
several
decades,
and
the
mixture
of
structured
and
abstract
really
appealed
to
me.
I
was
floored
when
Professor
Byrd
told
our
Literary
Women
class
that
our
final
assignment
had
to
be
a
creative.
I
panicked:
Me?
Creative?
WasnOt
creativity
something
we
were
supposed
to
leave
behind
after
grade
school?
After
trying
out
a
few
drafts,
however,
I
found
myself
really
Ngetting
into
itO,
and
my
final
product,
Sex
and
the
Acropolis,
a
modern
day
telling
of
the
Lysistrata,
was
actually
pretty
funny!
I
began
to
see
that
a
writer
has
the
opportunity
with
each
assignment
to
broaden
his
repertoire,
and
one
of
the
most
exciting
changes
I
have
noticed
in
my
own
writing
this
past
year
is
that
IOm
not
the
boring
expository
kind
of
girl
I
always
thought
I
was;
if
I
want
to
do
comedy,
I
can
do
comedy!
If
I
want
to
be
serious
and
erudite,
I
can
do
that,
too!
This
flexibility
as
a
writer
is
not
only
fun
for
me,
but
I
have
a
feeling
it
will
come
in
handy
in
the
future.
As
I
was
encountering
changes
in
my
own
writing,
I
was
simultaneously
embarking
on
my
first
semester
of
being
a
WA
for
ES
225.
I
was
understandably
nervous
about
this
assignment
because
not
only
was
it
a
class
of
engineers,
but
it
was
a
class
of
male
engineers
who
did
not
like
to
write.
Apparently
this
class
still
held
to
the
notion
that
girls
still
have
cooties,
because
I
felt
like
a
leper
for
each
and
every
conference.
The
student
would
arrive,
sit
down
(at
least
3
feet
away
from
me),
give
me
a
few
polite
nods,
and
leave
after
about
five
minutes.
I
tried
my
darndest
to
provoke
a
conversation
between
reader
and
writer,
but
these
students
did
not
consider
themselves
writers
and
therefore
had
nothing
to
say
about
the
piece
that
many
had
admitted
to
writing
the
night
before.
Thesis,
logical
structure,
and
other
apparently
stupid
suggestions
I
had
were
nodded
into
silence,
and
the
constant
lack
of
enthusiasm
in
the
students
despite
each
tactic
I
tried
(NWant
an
M&M?O
was
one
of
the
more
pathetic
attempts),
left
me
feeling
like
a
Bad
WA,
convinced
that
I
just
wasnOt
working
hard
enough.
I
kept
in
constant
communication
with
the
professor,
who
was
never
too
impressed
with
the
studentsO
papers,
but
that
seemed
to
make
matters
worse.
In
my
mind,
a
WA
should
be
a
neutral,
mediating
force
between
professor
and
student,
but
Professor
Hornfeck
and
I
became
somewhat
of
a
team,
complaining
to
each
other
about
the
students
and
their
lifeless
papers;
this
of
course
worsened
student-WA
relations,
and
I
would
be
lying
if
I
said
I
didnOt
hear
several
snickers
whenever
I
would
walk
by
the
students
in
Farinon
that
semester
(because
apparently
weOre
all
still
in
third
grade).
ES
225,
to
my
knowledge,
is
a
class
hated
by
all
engineers
(I
conducted
an
informal
poll),
and
I
think
a
large
part
of
my
lack
of
success
fall
semester
lay
in
the
disparity
between
what
the
Engineering
Department
and
what
the
English
department
considers
a
Ngood
paperO.
While
ignoring
even
the
slightest
stylistic
issues
goes
against
everything
in
me,
Professor
Hornfeck
and
his
colleagues
were
looking
only
for
Content,
Organization
and
Punctuation,
and
I
had
to
respect
their
wishes.
Perhaps
if
the
Engineering
Department
hired
several
proficient
engineers
to
NWAO
for
ES
225,
future
WAs
will
avoid
the
painful
experience
of
meeting
with
apathy
all
semester
long.
I
was
able
to
draw
some
encouragement
(in
a
sick,
twisted
sort
of
way)
from
the
whole
experience
when
I
received
my
feedback
sheets
from
the
students.
Professor
Seetch
may
remember
that
I
was
almost
in
tears
this
day
as
I
read
sheet
after
sheet
about
nothing
conference
related,
but
of
numerous
requests
for
my
phone
number,
and
suggestions
that
I
wear
a
bikini
next
time
to
better
the
overall
experience.
I
realized
that
a
class
of
male
engineers
paired
with
a
female
WA
sadly
did
not
work
in
my
case,
and
although
I
was
upset
at
the
outcome,
I
was
able
to
realize
that
it
wasnOt
my
fault.
Too
bad
I
wasted
all
that
time
writing
comments
at
the
end
of
the
papers
when
I
could
have
just
done
my
best
Vanna
White
and
walked
away
with
stellar
reviews!
Ready
for
the
worst
possible
scenario
second
semester,
I
changed
my
approach
to
the
writing
conference
before
I
even
met
the
class.
Although
IOm
sure
my
ES
225
experience
was
a
rare
one,
I
did
feel
that
I
had
talked
too
much,
written
too
much,
and
was
overall
just
over-zealous
about
the
papers
when
I
would
rather
see
that
enthusiasm
come
from
the
writers.
To
promote
more
of
a
balance
of
enthusiasm
during
my
conferences,
I
began
taking
my
notes
on
a
separate
notepad
rather
than
writing
directly
on
the
papers,
skimming
over
them
right
before
the
conference,
and
entering
into
the
conference
with
the
same
paper
the
student
turned
in
to
me.
This
new
approach
placed
much
more
responsibility
on
the
writer,
provoked
more
conversation
about
the
papers,
and
led
to
an
actual
exchange
between
student
and
WA
instead
of
just
head
nodding.
I
was
thrilled
to
work
with
Michelle
Geoffrion-Vinci,
one
of
the
most
enthusiastic
and
energetic
professors
IOve
had
at
Lafayette,
and
her
students
shared
that
positive
energy.
Not
only
did
they
take
to
my
new
approach
at
handling
conferences,
but
most
of
them
came
to
the
conferences
with
more
questions
than
I
could
answer
in
the
30
minute
time
slot!
Again,
this
class
was
an
exception
because
the
papers
were
written
in
Spanish,
and
many
questions
I
received
were
of
a
grammatical
nature.
While
I
understood
that
the
WA
program
is
not
an
editing
service,
I
recognized
many
recurring
grammatical
problems
in
the
studentsO
papers,
and
I
did
end
up
addressing
many
of
them
to
prevent
future
errors.
The
only
problem
I
had
with
the
collaboration
between
CWP
and
Foreign
Language
Departments
was
the
native
speaking
student
hired
by
Foreign
Languages
to
assist
me
with
this
class.
The
class
was
relatively
largeN24
studentsNand
part
of
the
reason
IOm
sure
was
a
matter
of
convenience,
but
because
the
student
hadnOt
been
trained
as
a
WA
or
was
even
aware
of
the
purpose
of
the
program,
I
ended
up
doing
just
as
much
work
conducting
damage-
control.
Perhaps
CWP
could
hire
WAs
specifically
designated
for
foreign
language
classes?
I
think
both
student
and
WA
could
benefit
from
a
more
integrated
systemNbetter
communication
all
around.
My
first
year
of
being
a
WA
changed
me
not
only
in
my
approach
to
developing
othersO
writing,
but
it
significantly
altered
my
approach
to
my
own
writing.
One
of
the
methods
I
use
that
makes
students
uncomfortable
but
also
makes
a
huge
difference
in
their
writing
is
bracketing
a
paragraph
and
then
moving
it
to
a
completely
different
page;
as
I
helped
others
destroy
NnormsO
and
patterns
in
their
writing,
I
was
able
to
recognize
similar
norms
in
my
own
writing.
I
had
never
been
one
for
revisingNI
hadnOt
written
a
draft
until
freshman
year
of
college,
and
even
then
I
would
usually
just
print
out
a
dumbed-
down
version
of
my
final
productNand
I
would
never
have
considered
asking
someone
else
for
input
on
one
of
my
papers.
Unfortunately,
the
WA
program
didnOt
exactly
coincide
with
what
I
thought
was
a
brilliant
editing
system,
so
I
needed
to
change
my
tune.
Feeling
like
a
total
hypocrite,
I
soon
began
to
break
my
own
rules,
and
before
I
knew
it
I
was
printing
out
the
same
paragraph
five
or
six
times,
marking
it
up,
and
then
printing
it
out
again.
This
was
definitely
uncharted
territory
for
me,
the
anti-reviser,
but
to
my
surprise,
I
was
creating
more
complex,
well
thought-out
papers
then
ever!
I
also
began
asking
a
select
few
what
they
thought
about
my
writing.
Surprisingly,
I
received
lots
of
helpful
feedback,
and
I
began
to
wonder
why
I
had
kept
my
writing
to
myself
all
these
years.
My
entire
writing
process
has
been
completely
turned
upside
down
since
becoming
a
WA,
and
although
my
new
system
is
neither
speedy
nor
eco-friendly
(at
least
I
recycle!),
it
is
thorough,
and
I
donOt
think
IOll
ever
go
back
to
my
old
ways.
As
I
prepare
to
enter
into
my
second
year
of
the
writing
program
as
a
WA
Mentor,
I
hope
to
bring
with
me
a
yearOs
worth
of
hard-earned
experience,
both
inside
the
WA
room
and
out.
This
summer
I
spent
roughly
fifty
hours
a
week
nannying
for
an
eight
year
old
girl,
Jill,
and
Jill
has
changed
my
entire
world.
In
a
society
that
makes
us
grow
up
so
quickly,
I
have
softened
as
a
human
being
as
I
have
spent
the
summer
viewing
the
world
through
a
childOs
eyes.
There
is
no
room
for
criticism
or
judgment
in
a
realm
where
clouds
still
assume
shapes
of
animals
and
Easy
Mac
is
the
preferred
entre;
indirectly,
Jill
has
prepared
me
to
be
the
best
WA
Mentor
I
can,
because
IOve
been
gently
guiding
her
all
summer.
I
await
the
coming
school
year,
just
as
Jill
does,
with
anticipation;
we
bought
our
pencils
and
notebooks
the
other
day,
and
we
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
in
the
checkout
lane,
knowing
that
the
best
is
ahead
for
us.
Even
though
Jill
and
I
are
experiencing
completely
different
stages
of
life,
we
relate
to
and
better
each
other,
and
as
a
Mentor
I
hope
to
do
these
same
things:
relate
to
the
WA
team,
be
there
for
support
and
guidance,
and
experience
life
AWA
as
fully
as
possible!
Cheers
to
a
great
year
ahead.
