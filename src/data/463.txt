My
Literary
Narrative
My
earliest
memories
involving
writing
date
back
to
kindergarten.
Sadly,
I
do
not
remember
very
much
from
that
year,
but
sprinkled
in
amongst
vague
memories
of
sandboxes,
oversized
Clifford
books,
and
finger
paintings
do
in
fact
lay
my
very
first
memories
of
writing.
Although
not
exactly
up
to
par
with
William
Faulkner,
my
initial
writings
were
products
of
the
incredibly
underrated
NcutesyO
genre:
drawings
of
stick
figure
families,
smiling
suns,
and
pointy-roofed
houses,
all
accompanied
by
a
small
paragraph
describing
the
scene
and
why
it
represented
the
wonderful
nature
of
my
life.
It
was
here
that
I
began
to
understand
the
basic
manipulation
of
the
English
language,
how
to
construct
a
simple
yet
complete
sentence,
and
learned
some
of
the
more
elementary
rules
of
writing
(i.e.
how
every
sentence
needs
to
have
a
subject,
verb,
etc.).
While
not
very
complex,
these
short
descriptions
served
as
the
foundation
upon
which
each
successive
year
of
writing
would
be
built.
Much
of
the
growth
my
writing
experienced
during
my
elementary
school
years
was
centered
on
core
concepts
such
as
grammar,
punctuation,
penmanship,
and
spelling.
I
remember
in
Kindergarten
we
used
to
spend
each
week
focusing
on
a
different
letter
of
the
alphabet.
We
learned
how
to
actually
write
the
letter,
how
it
is
pronounced
depending
upon
where
it
lies
within
a
word,
and
a
plethora
of
words
that
begin
with
that
particular
letter.
The
alphabet
is
the
base
of
the
English
language,
and
each
letter
is
a
building
block
that
can
be
used
to
construct
anything
from
the
simplest
of
words
to
the
most
complex
stories
and
analyses.
Throughout
my
early
years
in
elementary
school,
I
continued
to
strengthen
my
command
of
the
alphabet,
with
the
emphasis
placed
upon
spelling
and
punctuation.
Thus,
little
Krebs,
with
his
overstuffed
backpack
and
Ninja
Turtle
fruit
snacks,
was
doing
splendidly
in
school.
I
was
truly
maturing
not
only
as
a
fine
student
but
as
a
quality
writer
as
well.
Then,
seemingly
out
of
nowhere,
came
the
dreaded
cursive
lessons
in
third
grade.
Cursive,
or
script
as
we
called
it
in
school,
is
in
my
opinion
completely
and
utterly
useless.
Perhaps
it
is
wrong
of
me
to
feel
this
way
about
script;
perhaps
society
expects
a
newly
selected
Lafayette
College
Writing
Associate
such
as
myself
to
embrace
this
classic
form
of
writing
but
I
do
not.
In
all
honesty,
I
have
never
understood
the
point
of
cursive.
In
third
grade,
similar
to
the
alphabet
exercises
I
performed
in
kindergarten,
we
studied
a
different
cursive
letter
each
week.
Each
of
us
was
assigned
our
very
own
cursive
workbook,
and
we
would
have
to
write
the
letter
of
the
week
over
and
over
(in
both
uppercase
and
lowercase)
until
we
developed
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
(or
the
stereotypical
overly
exaggerated
third
graderOs
equivalent
of
carpal
tunnel
syndrome).
After
weeks
of
performing
these
grueling
exercises,
I
actually
became
comfortable
enough
with
cursive
to
begin
using
it
instead
of
traditional
freehand.
However,
after
I
graduated
from
third
grade
and
moved
up
to
fourth,
I
was
no
longer
forced
to
write
in
cursive.
Thus,
being
the
sane
child
I
was
at
the
time,
I
opted
not
to
use
script
any
longer,
and
within
months
soon
forgot
how
to
write
many
of
the
letters
from
the
cursive
alphabet.
Maybe
this
should
bother
me,
but
it
does
not.
I
have
never
had
any
need
for
cursive,
and
the
only
time
I
ever
use
it
is
when
I
sign
my
name,
and
even
then
half
of
the
letters
are
mere
scribbles.
To
put
a
cap
on
this
rant
I
will
say
this:
cursive
taught
me
that
there
are
some
aspects
of
the
English
language
that
I
more
or
less
despise.
As
I
continue
to
grow
as
a
writer
and
occasionally
encounter
one
of
these
despicable
aspects,
it
only
strengthens
my
appreciation
for
those
qualities
of
the
language
that
I
so
greatly
adore.
Not
all
of
my
elementary
school
experiences
were
so
horrifying.
Ironic
as
it
is,
around
the
same
time
cursive
was
making
my
life
miserable,
my
passion
for
writing
was
becoming
stronger
than
ever.
In
an
attempt
to
feed
my
growing
passion,
my
teachers
provided
me
with
an
endless
supply
of
blank
hardcover
books.
These
provided
me
with
the
means
to
take
many
of
the
stories
and
ideas
that
I
had
been
cultivating
in
my
mind
and
actually
formulate
them
into
full-blown
stories.
All
of
a
sudden
evolved
from
being
another
typical
suburban
fourth-grader
into
a
published
author
and
illustrator.
I
became
so
obsessed
with
creating
these
books
that
I
would
start
working
on
my
next
masterpiece
before
the
current
one
was
even
completed.
I
designed
the
covers,
handwrote
the
entire
stories,
and
then
made
sure
to
share
the
books
with
everyone
in
the
classroom.
The
writing
did
not
stop
as
the
school
day
came
to
an
end,
though,
and
I
soon
began
dedicating
more
and
more
time
to
writing
at
home.
I
had
one
friend
in
particular
who
enjoyed
writing
almost
as
much
as
I
did,
and
we
would
plan
sleepovers
just
to
give
us
a
chance
to
make
a
new
book
together.
Yes,
as
odd
as
it
may
seem,
while
most
children
were
busy
playing
their
Sega
Genesis
or
building
forts
out
of
couch
cushions,
my
friend
and
I
would
be
writing
everything
that
came
to
our
minds
in
a
constant
state
of
fervor
that
was
paramount
to
that
of
many
students
twice
our
age.
This
newfound
passion
was
in
all
certainty
a
major
leap
forward
for
my
progress
as
a
writer,
because
it
was
the
first
significant
instance
that
I
can
remember
in
which
I
wrote
based
solely
upon
my
own
free
will.
I
was
not
simply
fulfilling
an
assignment
or
writing
for
a
grade,
but
rather
I
was
writing
because
I
enjoyed
it.
Typically,
when
a
student
takes
an
interest
in
something
he
has
learned
in
the
classroom
and
then
takes
it
several
steps
further
in
his
own
free
time,
it
is
a
sign
of
good
things
to
come.
This
is
a
premise
to
which
I
can
personally
attest.
As
my
elementary
school
years
came
to
an
end
and
middle
school
became
my
new
home,
I
began
learning
about
many
different
types
and
styles
of
writing
that
had
previously
been
alien
to
me.
As
far
as
I
remember,
during
my
last
few
years
of
elementary
school
(primarily
fourth
and
fifth
grade)
I
began
to
learn
how
to
write
academic
papers.
In
fourth
grade
I
remember
writing
a
short
research
report
on
humpback
whales
and
musk
oxen,
and
in
fifth
grade
I
wrote
several
book
reports.
Other
than
that,
a
great
deal
of
my
writing
was
fiction,
in
addition
to
many
self-reflection
assignments
and
journal
entries.
In
middle
school,
however,
I
delved
much
deeper
into
academic
writing.
I
was
always
placed
in
the
gifted
and
talented
English
classes,
and
so
I
was
exposed
to
many
different
types
of
writing
at
a
much
faster
pace
than
most
of
my
peers.
Over
the
course
of
the
seventh
and
eight
grades,
I
covered
everything
from
writing
in-depth
biographical
reports
to
sociological
newsletters.
My
teachers
were
usually
very
encouraging
when
it
came
to
writing,
and
they
made
sure
to
inform
me
of
how
talented
they
believed
me
to
be.
They
were
also
very
influential
in
helping
me
to
discover
my
own
literary
voice.
As
I
am
sure
you
have
noticed,
my
writing
style
is
quite
elaborate,
and
I
tend
to
construct
long
sentences
containing
flowery
language
and
a
hearty
supply
of
commas.
I
can
at
times
experience
great
difficulties
when
required
to
write
in
short,
concrete
sentences
(such
as
with
a
science
lab
report).
While
my
writing
style
is
the
product
of
nineteen
years
of
experiences,
writings,
readings,
and
mentors,
I
believe
it
is
due
in
large
part
to
my
seventh
grade
English
teacher.
She
was
an
ardent
believer
in
elaboration,
and
would
often
encourage
us
to
construct
long,
complex
sentences,
complemented
by
shorter
ones
when
necessary.
It
was
also
stressed
to
us
that
there
is
a
great
difference
between
using
descriptive,
elaborate
language
and
simply
writing
Na
whole
lot
of
nothingO
just
to
fill
up
space
or
meet
a
page
requirement.
I
take
pride
in
being
able
to
recognize
this
important
distinction,
and
I
always
make
sure
that
no
matter
how
long
my
sentences
are
I
am
always
saying
NsomethingO.
Another
milestone
for
me
occurred
in
eighth
grade,
when
I
decided
to
submit
one
of
my
creative
writing
pieces
to
the
WritersO
Showcase.
The
WritersO
Showcase
was
a
highly
anticipated
awards
ceremony
(believe
it
or
not
it
actually
was
highly
anticipated,
this
is
not
yet
another
attempt
on
my
part
to
demonstrate
my
sardonic
wit)
that
recognized
the
most
talented
writers
from
kindergarten
to
twelfth
grade.
Each
year
hundreds
of
students
would
submit
their
pieces
with
the
hopes
of
being
celebrated
as
their
gradeOs
most
talented
writer.
In
eighth
grade
I
submitted
a
fictional
story
I
had
written
that
year
about
a
young
drug
addict
who
finds
his
life
spiraling
out
of
control,
and
eventually
loses
his
beloved
older
brother
as
a
result
of
his
failure
to
pay
a
bloodthirsty
neighborhood
dealer.
When
my
English
teacher
called
me
at
home
one
evening,
and
informed
me
that
I
had
been
that
yearOs
winner,
I
was
ecstatic.
I
had
always
had
the
support
and
praise
of
my
family
and
teachers,
but
I
had
yet
in
my
career
as
a
writer
to
be
recognized
publicly
for
my
talents
in
front
of
my
peers.
I
find
it
difficult
to
put
into
words,
but
this
recognition
provided
me
with
a
sense
of
exuberance
and
pride
that
was
different
from
any
other.
Perhaps
this
is
an
indication
of
an
insecurity
lurking
somewhere
beneath
my
skin,
but
it
felt
great
to
finally
prove
to
the
world
that
I
could
write.
It
did
not
hurt
that
I
won
the
following
year
as
well!
I
entered
high
school
with
the
utmost
confidence
in
my
writing
ability,
and
I
was
quickly
realizing
that
when
it
came
to
writing
I
was
far
more
advanced
than
most
of
my
peers.
I
continued
to
excel
at
all
different
types
of
academic
writing,
and
began
experimenting
with
new
forms
of
creative
writing
as
well.
One
piece
that
I
have
particularly
fond
memories
of
is
a
stage
play
I
wrote
in
ninth
grade.
The
reason
I
remember
this
play
so
clearly
is
that
it
represents
one
of
the
few
times
I
have
written
a
story
in
which
the
characters
and
conflicts
are
for
the
most
part
reflections
of
my
own
life.
Most
of
the
stories
I
write
are
focused
on
some
great
ideal
or
belief
of
which
I
feel
strongly,
and
the
story
is
designed
to
demonstrate
the
virtue
and
wisdom
behind
the
said
principle.
Also,
staying
true
to
my
roots
as
a
Thomas
Hardy
aficionado,
I
view
the
world
to
be
hopelessly
tragic,
and
so
many
of
my
stories
result
in
pain
and
suffering
for
all
and
utopian
bliss
for
none.
When
I
wrote
this
stage
play,
though,
I
decided
to
deviate
from
my
usual
style
and
inject
the
characters
with
a
lot
of
my
own
history
and
life
experiences.
The
end
result
was
a
story
that
provided
the
reader
with
a
direct
window
into
my
heart
and
soul,
an
expos
of
the
complex
relationship
that
exists
between
my
family
and
I.
On
the
one
hand,
writing
about
something
so
close
to
my
heart
was
scary,
and
left
me
feeling
cheap
and
vulnerable
for
advertising
the
intimate
details
of
my
life
to
anyone
who
cared
to
listen.
At
the
same
time,
however,
it
felt
good
to
release
a
lot
of
the
pent-up
feelings
and
emotions
that
had
been
building
up
inside
of
me
over
the
years.
All
in
all,
writing
this
play
taught
me
how
powerful
the
written
word
can
be,
especially
when
it
comes
directly
from
oneOs
own
heart.
Of
course,
oneOs
work
is
oftentimes
only
as
good
as
the
opinions
of
those
who
read
it,
and
so
as
my
senior
year
quickly
approached
I
decided
to
join
the
school
newspaper
staff.
Being
the
strongly
opinionated
young
man
I
am,
I
decided
to
apply
for
the
editor
position
for
the
Feature
staff,
which
would
allow
me
to
write
a
monthly
column
in
addition
to
my
other
articles.
It
did
not
take
long
for
the
Kennebunk
High
School
population
to
learn
who
was,
and
I
was
quickly
becoming
one
of
the
administrationOs
most
beloved
thorns.
Let
us
just
say
that
my
columns
produced
a
love-hate
relationship
with
my
fellow
peers
and
teachers.
As
much
as
some
people
hated
to
admit
it,
the
first
thing
the
readers
did
when
the
new
issue
was
released
was
turn
right
to
my
column.
By
mid-day
the
buzz
would
already
be
circulating
throughout
the
school,
and
the
letters
to
the
editor
would
be
rolling
in
like
fresh
bread
off
a
bakery
assembly
line.
And
I
loved
every
minute
of
it.
As
far
as
I
am
concerned,
if
a
writer
can
evoke
such
impassioned
responses
from
his
readers,
then
he
is
doing
something
right.
The
more
mail
we
received
in
response
to
my
columns,
the
more
determined
I
became
to
take
my
next
editorial
a
step
further
and
really
push
the
envelope
(in
fact,
I
can
proudly
state
that
one
of
my
articles
was
taken
out
of
circulation
at
the
last
minute
because
the
administration
believed
it
to
be
too
NsuggestiveO).
Finally,
my
writing
was
receiving
the
type
of
overwhelming
recognition
and
thought
that
I
have
always
believed
it
to
deserve.
I
hate
to
sound
like
a
broken
record,
but
it
felt
absolutely
wonderful.
This
narrative
would
not
be
complete
if
I
did
not
include
my
freshman
year
at
Lafayette.
This
same
time
last
year,
I
was
preparing
to
embark
upon
the
grandest
adventure
of
my
life,
and
I
was
experiencing
a
whole
bundle
of
emotions
from
sheer
excitement
to
trenchant
fear.
Then
of
course
there
was
the
part
of
me
that
wondered
if
I
indeed
had
what
it
would
take
to
get
through
college.
I
became
so
used
to
excelling
at
everything
I
did
in
high
school,
especially
as
a
writer,
that
I
feared
my
life
could
only
go
downhill
from
that
point
forward.
Before
I
even
knew
what
hit
me,
I
was
loading
my
belongings
into
my
new
humble
abode
(my
abode
was
especially
humble)
and
waving
goodbye
to
my
parents.
It
did
not
take
long,
however,
for
me
to
realize
that
I
was
in
the
same
boat
as
everyone
else,
and
that
I
was
an
achiever
who
would
always
achieve,
and
college
would
be
no
different
than
the
previous
14
years
of
schooling.
My
very
first
paper
was
written
for
a
professor
whom
had
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
collegeOs
tougher
graders,
and
yet
sure
enough
he
handed
it
back
to
me
with
an
A-
on
it.
After
the
first
couple
weeks
of
classes
I
felt
as
strongly
as
I
had
ever
felt
about
myself,
and
was
fully
confident
in
my
abilities
as
a
student
and
as
a
writer.
My
toughest
challenge
by
far
was
my
psychology
lab,
because,
as
I
mentioned
above,
I
have
a
hard
time
writing
in
short,
concise
sentences.
Even
that,
though,
was
only
a
temporary
challenge,
as
I
was
soon
able
to
adjust
to
the
style
and
produce
a
top-notch
lab
report.
I
finished
my
freshman
year
with
a
near
perfect
GPA,
and
I
cannot
wait
to
confront
the
challenges
this
next
year
will
provide.
