For
the
first
eighteen
years
of
my
life,
I
was
terrified
of
writing.
The
idea
of
making
my
thoughts
into
something
concrete
never
appealed
to
me.
It
was
not
until
I
entered
college
that
I
found
my
strength
as
a
writer.
I
wish
my
literacy
narrative
was
filled
with
poetry
awards
and
published
works,
but
it
is
not.
I
never
gave
myself
an
opportunity
to
have
my
work
put
on
display.
I
spent
the
majority
of
my
life
hiding
my
writing
or
not
writing
at
all.
My
literacy
narrative
begins
with
my
father.
My
father
is
a
writer
and
has
been
his
entire
life.
He
graduated
from
the
University
of
Pennsylvania
with
a
bachelorOs
degree
in
English
and
Communications.
From
there,
he
took
any
writing
jobs
that
came
his
way.
For
a
while
he
free-lanced,
then
worked
as
a
writer
for
a
major
oil
company,
penned
a
few
non-fiction
books,
and
eventually
opened
up
his
own
public
relations
firm.
He
started
his
firm
when
I
was
one,
so
IOve
watched
his
business
grow
my
entire
life.
At
the
time,
I
didnOt
know
what
a
PR
firm
did,
but
I
did
know
that
my
Dad
was
a
writer.
My
fatherOs
passion
for
writing
should
have
made
my
own
foray
into
the
field
easy.
I
should
have
been
encouraged
by
his
success
and
used
him
as
a
literacy
mentor.
Instead,
it
overwhelmed
me.
I
enjoyed
writing,
but
was
always
plagued
with
doubt.
How
could
my
own
writing
ever
be
a
good
as
my
fatherOs?
How
could
I
ever
reach
the
same
level
of
success?
To
avoid
my
own
feelings
of
inadequacy,
I
hid
my
interest
in
writing.
The
only
space
I
allowed
myself
a
voice
was
in
a
small
journal,
which
I
locked
in
a
plastic
safe
under
my
bed.
My
second-grade-self
loved
my
journal.
It
was
where
I
kept
the
secrets
of
the
boys
that
I
liked,
what
I
really
thought
about
my
teachers,
and
how
mean
my
siblings
were.
I
told
no
one
about
its
existence
and
made
sure
to
only
write
in
it
once
everyone
went
to
bed.
ItOs
easy
to
assume
that
my
secretiveness
was
due
to
the
sensitivity
of
the
journalOs
topics
(imagine
if
it
fell
into
the
wrong
hands
and
Nicholas
Chapaleare
found
out
that
I
liked
him),
but
that
was
not
the
main
reason
I
kept
it
hidden.
I
was
more
concerned
that
if
someone
read
it,
they
would
tell
me
that
I
was
a
bad
writer.
As
I
said
before,
I
enjoyed
writing,
but
was
terrified
of
it.
Terrified
of
my
words
being
leached
out
into
the
world
where
everyone
would
laugh
at
my
misspellings
and
run-on
sentences.
I
was
especially
worried
that
my
writing
would
fall
into
the
hands
of
my
father,
where
he
would
be
so
discouraged
in
my
inability
to
write
that
he
would
enroll
me
in
a
school
that
only
taught
math.
My
journal
turned
into
my
writing
sanctuary,
a
place
where
I
could
engage
in
my
interest
in
language
without
being
judged
for
my
usage
of
it,
or
thatOs
what
I
thought.
One
day,
my
older
brother
caught
me
writing
in
my
journal
late
at
night.
I
was
horrified
because
my
brother
was
not
a
secret
keeper
and
had
an
all-encompassing
curiosity.
It
only
took
him
two
days
after
discovering
the
existence
of
the
journal
to
get
his
hands
on
it
and
read
its
contents.
I
waited
for
days
to
hear
him
taunt
me
about
my
writing,
but
it
never
came.
Instead,
he
turned
to
my
father
to
discuss
what
he
had
read.
In
the
middle
of
a
normal
family
dinner
my
brother
blurted
out,
NDad,
when
you
die
you
should
leave
your
company
to
Megan.O
Obviously,
my
father
was
shocked
to
hear
my
brother
planning
his
will,
so
he
replied,
NWhat
makes
you
say
that?O
and
without
a
momentOs
hesitation
he
blurted
out,
NWell,
have
you
read
her
writing?
ItOs
great.O
That
was
the
first
compliment
I
ever
received
about
my
writing
and
to
this
day
it
still
makes
me
smile.
My
brotherOs
endorsement
of
my
writing
encouraged
me
to
continue
working
in
my
journal.
I
decided
my
new
work
was
going
to
be
even
better
than
the
original.
As
I
grew
older,
my
knowledge
about
writing
also
grew.
I
soon
learned
that
there
were
better
ways
to
say
certain
phrases
than
others.
By
fourth
grade,
I
had
written
my
way
through
four
journals,
but
I
was
not
satisfied
with
their
contents.
I
deemed
that
my
fifth
journal
would
be
better.
It
would
be
well-written
and
explore
a
variety
of
topics,
more
than
just
boys
and
my
siblings.
I
opened
the
first
page
of
my
new,
proper
journal
and
began
writing,
NMy
This
journal
is
only
for
me
will
be
written
to
talk
about
what
I
do
each
day
detail
the
events
of
the
life
of
M.
Matusky.O
I
could
barely
make
it
through
one
sentence
without
crossing
it
out
and
re-writing
it
three
times.
This
made
my
journaling
slow
work.
I
would
sit
down
to
write
an
installment
each
night,
but
do
to
my
obsessive
editing,
never
made
it
more
than
four
sentences
before
giving
up.
I
would
rip
out
poorly
written
pages,
scribble
over
full
paragraphs
in
black
pen,
and
re-transcribe
entries
again
and
again
until
I
got
the
wording
just
right.
In
my
mind,
this
was
a
form
of
writing
discipline
to
keep
myself
from
writing
anything
that
could
be
considered
bad.
My
critical
glances
also
made
my
writing
exceptionally
boring.
I
learned
to
edit
out
my
own
voice.
This
ability
came
in
handy
once
I
entered
middle
school.
I
attended
a
large
public
middle
school,
where
it
was
easy
to
get
lost
in
your
own
education.
I
was
also
lucky
enough
to
reach
middle
school
right
when
Bushes
brilliant
NNo
child
left
behindO
law
was
passed.
Large
middle
schools
like
mine
needed
a
lot
of
money
to
keep
them
running,
which
is
why
the
government
money
promised
to
schools
who
performed
well
on
standardized
tests
was
taken
seriously.
My
middle
school
needed
the
money,
which
meant
the
kids
needed
to
do
well
on
the
tests.
I
felt
my
education
shift
in
the
next
few
years.
I
saw
teachers
eliminate
unique
and
interesting
lessons
for
standard,
test-directed
curriculums.
We
would
spend
class
time
learning
test
taking
techniques
and
taking
practice
tests
to
prepare
ourselves
for
D-Day.
The
humanities
were
curbed
to
make
room
for
math
and
science,
but
nothing
took
a
bigger
hit
than
English.
The
English
curriculum
was
whittled
down
to
focus
on
one
thing,
the
five
paragraph
essay.
No
writing
form
stifles
creativity
and
writing
ability
more.
Its
purpose
was
to
teach
students
to
argue
a
point
concisely.
Any
good
five
paragraph
essay
is
set
up
as
follows,
introduction
(ending
with
a
thesis
usually
beginning
with
although),
first
body
paragraph
(arguing
the
piece
of
evidence
that
fits
best
with
your
thesis),
second
body
paragraph
(the
paragraph
where
you
hide
your
weakest
piece
of
evidence),
third
body
paragraph
(whatever
you
have
left),
and
conclusion
(rewrite
the
introduction
in
different
words).
These
types
of
essays
were
what
was
expected
on
standardized
tests
and
therefore
drilled
into
every
public
school
student.
This
was
when
my
relationship
with
writing
was
the
weakest.
I
stopped
any
creative
pursuits
of
my
own
language
and
focused
my
energy
on
writing
in
one
static
form.
This
mechanical
form
of
writing
continued
until
10th
grade.
In
10th
grade
I
took
English
2
with
one
of
the
most
eccentric
teachers
in
my
high
school.
She
wasnOt
the
best
teacher
by
any
stretch,
but
I
loved
her
because
she
veered
off
the
typical
English
curriculum.
She
introduced
us
to
poetry,
short
stories,
and
mythology.
My
favorite
unit
was
classic
mythology,
where
the
entire
class
was
assigned
to
write
their
own
myth
featuring
a
heroOs
journey.
I
had
never
been
asked
to
write
a
piece
of
creative
writing
for
a
class
and
I
couldnOt
be
more
excited.
The
moment
I
received
the
assignment
I
began
working
on
it
and
concocted
an
elaborate
myth
set
in
modern
times.
I
included
allegories,
illusions,
foreshadowing,
anything
I
could
to
make
my
myth
as
strong
as
it
could
be.
No
piece
of
writing
in
my
English
career
have
I
been
more
proud
of.
After
I
handed
in
my
story,
I
anxiously
waited
for
it
to
be
returned
to
me
with
my
teacherOs
comments,
but
that
day
never
came.
My
10th
grade
teacher
went
the
entire
year
without
ever
returning
our
stories
and
when
we
asked
about
them
on
the
last
day,
she
said
she
dropped
them
in
a
puddle
and
wouldnOt
be
able
to
return
them.
I
couldnOt
help
but
mourn
the
loss
of
my
proudest
work.
High
school
English
continued
along
the
same
path.
I
would
write
five
paragraph
essays
and
receive
contrived
comments
or
occasionally
write
creative
pieces
and
have
them
pass
unnoticed
by
my
teachers.
I
felt
as
though
my
writing
stood
out,
yet
I
never
received
any
feedback
that
my
writing
ability
was
slightly
more
than
ordinary.
I
was
discouraged
from
writing
and
came
to
terms
with
that
fact
that
maybe
the
writing
gene
was
not
passed
down
from
my
father.
For
that
reason,
I
enrolled
in
Lafayette
College
as
undecided.
I
still
knew
that
I
enjoyed
English,
but
I
felt
that
I
was
not
talented
enough
to
pursue
it
as
a
major.
I
avoided
taking
an
English
class
first
semester,
but
after
not
finding
an
interest
in
the
myriad
of
other
courses,
I
broke
down
and
took
Literary
Questions
second
semester.
It
was
in
that
class
that
I
fell
in
love
with
English
all
over
again
and
decided
that
no
matter
my
lack
of
feedback,
I
was
going
to
pursue
it.
It
wasnOt
until
sophomore
year
where
I
found
myself
in
a
class
solely
focused
on
writing.
The
class
was
entitled
Writing
Genres
and
we
spent
the
semester
focused
on
writing
personal
essays.
It
took
me
a
while
to
fall
out
of
my
five
paragraph
essay
mold,
but
eventually
I
fell
in
love
with
the
form
of
the
personal
essay.
I
was
finally
able
to
use
my
own
voice
in
writing.
I
could
be
funny,
unique,
and
sometime
grammatically
incorrect,
but
the
form
allowed
for
it.
I
wrote
essays
in
my
own
voice
about
Computer-Televisions
and
running
a
400
and
for
the
first
time
since
elementary
school,
I
felt
as
if
I
was
writing
in
my
journal
again.
I
felt
that
I
had
my
voice
back.
I
was
ecstatic
about
writing
again,
until
the
day
the
professor
asked
me
to
meet
him
in
his
office
about
one
of
my
essays.
I
was
terrified
and
began
to
wish
I
hadnOt
been
so
bold
with
my
writing
choices.
We
met
during
office
hours
and
the
first
thing
out
of
the
professorOs
mouth
was,
Nwhere
did
you
learn
to
write
like
this?O
The
question
took
me
aback.
For
a
second,
I
couldnOt
tell
if
he
was
asking
because
he
was
concerned
for
my
education
or
impressed,
but
a
smile
spread
over
his
face
and
I
knew
it
to
be
the
latter.
I
racked
my
brain
for
a
valid
answer,
high
school---T.S.
Elliot---online,
but
nothing
was
accurate.
Finally
I
blurted
out,
Nmy
dad.O
He
seemed
satisfied.
That
night,
I
sent
the
same
essay
to
my
dad
and
asked
him
for
his
feedback.
All
I
received
in
return
was,
NAwesome.O
Since
then,
I
added
a
writing
concentration
to
my
English
major
and
began
to
embrace
writing
for
the
first
time.
I
learned
to
feel
comfortable
reading
my
own
work
to
others
and
even
more
comfortable
hearing
their
feedback
afterwards.
I
now
know
that
not
everything
I
write
is
good,
but
I
am
accepting
of
that.
IOve
come
to
enjoy
hearing
others
criticism
of
my
work
and
take
it
to
heart,
so
that
I
can
become
better
the
next
time
I
write.
In
three
years
of
college,
I
learned
more
about
writing
than
I
had
in
my
entire
life
combined.
My
literacy
narrative
ends
for
the
time
being
with
my
summer
internship,
where
I
was
hired
by
my
fatherOs
PR
firm
to
write.
I
spent
the
last
two
summers
working
in
a
new
form,
the
blog.
To
me,
the
blogosphere
is
nothing
more
than
thousands
of
journals
read
out
loud
by
older
brothers.
There
is
nothing
I
find
more
thrilling.
I
hope
to
continue
writing
in
the
blog
form
because
it
combines
my
two
favorite
writing
styles,
journaling
and
personal
essays.
I
am
excited
to
see
how
my
literacy
narrative
continues
in
the
future.
I
am
no
longer
terrified
of
writing.
