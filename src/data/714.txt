Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative
August
3,
2011
Although
I
am
by
title
now
a
Nveteran
WAO,
I
barely
see
myself
that
way.
I
really
only
have
one
semester
of
WA-ing
under
my
belt,
since
I
spent
all
last
semester
(January-
June)
abroad
in
New
Zealand.
Spending
an
entire
semester
(and
then
some)
abroad
means
that
most
things
pertaining
to
life
at
Lafayette,
be
that
academics,
social
life,
or
extracurricular
activities,
were
nowhere
near
the
top
on
my
list
of
priorities,
and
often
not
on
my
mind
at
all.
So,
sitting
here
now
and
reflecting
on
my
experience
as
a
WA,
it
feels
like
I
am
looking
back
on
a
rather
distant
part
of
my
life,
if
only
because
the
past
year
has
been
so
full
and
exciting
for
me.
Even
so,
there
are
still
some
specific
conferences
that
I
have
held
that
come
to
mind
when
thinking
back
over
what
I
have
learned
from
this
program
so
far.
After
being
assigned
the
professor
whose
class
I
was
to
WA,
the
first
really
concrete
emotion
I
remember
feeling
can
most
closely
be
described
as
fear.
Did
I
really
have
to
go
meet
this
professor
all
on
my
own,
and
tell
her
how
I
wanted
things
to
be
done?
Was
it
really
going
to
be
my
responsibility
to
make
sure
that
the
type
and
number
of
assignments
she
had
planned
fit
accordingly
with
the
WAOs
required
three
meetings
with
each
student?
And
was
I
really
going
to
have
to
report
back
to
the
professor,
telling
her
which
students
didnOt
collaborate
with
me,
and
which
ones
didnOt
even
show
up
to
our
conferences?
I
started
out
by
emailing
my
professor;
I
must
have
reread
the
simple
draft
about
seven
times
before
finally
clicking
NsendO.
As
it
turns
out,
there
was
no
need
for
such
close
examination
and
concern
D
for
I
had
sent
it
to
the
wrong
professor.
Apparently,
there
were
two
Lafayette
professors
with
the
same
last
name,
and
as
luck
would
have
it,
I
had
picked
the
wrong
one
off
of
the
email
list.
From
here
on
out,
however,
almost
nothing
in
the
program
met
my
expectations
D
and
I
mean
this
in
the
best
way
possible.
When
I
finally
did
meet
my
professor,
I
found
her
to
be
extremely
relaxed
and
open-minded,
which
was
perfect
for
my
first
semester
as
a
WA.
Her
hours
were
flexible,
as
were
her
assignments
and
her
overall
attitude.
She
didnOt
require
a
meeting
or
a
report
from
me
after
every
student
meeting;
instead,
she
asked
that
I
email
her
only
if
some
sort
of
ongoing
problem
developed.
As
an
added
bonus,
the
class
she
was
teaching
was
one
that
interested
me,
so
I
found
that
as
the
semester
progressed
and
I
read
paper
after
paper,
my
interest
was
still
pretty
steadily
maintained.
This
is
where
one
of
my
first
suggestions
for
new
WAOs
comes
up.
The
class
that
you
are
assigned
to
WA
for
might
not
fall
under
your
major,
and
a
good
chance
exists
that
it
is
one
that
you
will
never
even
have
heard
of;
however,
do
not
immediately
write
it
off
as
boring
or
Nbelow
youO.
Instead,
view
the
class
not
only
as
a
part
of
your
responsibility
as
a
WA,
but
also
as
a
chance
to
learn
something
completely
new.
If
you
can
maintain
a
level
of
interest
in
the
papers
that
you
read
and
edit,
you
are
sure
to
be
more
focused
on
what
your
are
reading,
and
thus
more
likely
to
invest
more
time
and
attention
into
the
overall
success
of
each
individual
paper.
In
my
experience,
I
actually
found
some
of
the
papers
I
read
to
be
intriguing
enough
that
I
went
out
of
my
way
to
do
extra
research
on
the
studentOs
topic.
This
allowed
me
to
be
able
to
give
him/her
additional
and
more
accurate
criticism;
but
as
a
personal
bonus,
it
expanded
my
own
knowledge,
too.
Another
thing
that
I
found
reassuring
was
that,
since
my
professor
taught
two
FYSOs,
she
had
another
WA
working
with
her,
too
(in
addition
to
me).
This
second
WA
was
a
first
year
WA,
too,
so
we
were
able
to
discuss
potential
problems
before
they
arose,
and
if
one
of
us
had
a
question
about
deadlines
or
meeting
dates,
we
both
served
as
an
additional
resource
to
each
other.
While
not
all
professors
will
have
two
WAOs
(I
think
the
majority
probably
do
not),
it
is
important
to
remember
that
all
other
WAOs
in
the
program
can
also
be
of
help
when
a
problem
arises:
even
if
they
have
worked
with
a
different
professor
and
with
different
students,
the
tasks
and
problems
that
WAOs
encounter
year
to
year
are
probably
quite
similar.
This
makes
veteran
WAOs
the
very
best
resource
available
whenever
you
are
faced
with
a
sticky
dilemma
with
a
student
(or
even
with
your
professor).
Although
I
am
always
critical
of
myself,
being
a
WA
has
forced
me
to
be
even
more
aware
of
tiny
details
in
my
writing.
My
theory
is
this:
if
I
am
going
to
tell
other
students
to
mind
their
commas
and
clauses
and
so
forth,
I
better
be
doing
so
myself.
If
students
are
going
to
rely
on
me
to
edit
and
improve
their
papers,
then
I,
I
turn,
feel
a
need
to
be
entirely
confident
in
my
grammar.
One
place
I
especially
felt
this
responsibility
is
when
it
comes
to
citing
books
and
articles:
the
formatting
for
works
cited
pages
are
so
specific
and
so
easy
to
mess
up,
that
I
started
taking
an
outline
sheet
with
me
to
every
meeting.
This
meant
that
I
could
help
students
modify
their
works
cited
pages
without
having
to
worry
if
I
was
misinforming
them
on
punctuation
and
indentation.
Early
on,
in
one
of
my
meetings,
I
noticed
that
a
student
was
constantly
misusing
commas,
more
often
than
not
entirely
forgetting
to
use
them
at
all.
As
I
kept
correcting
her
sentences,
she
finally
asked
me
why
all
of
these
places
needed
commas,
and
while
I
knew
the
answer
instinctively,
I
could
not
actually
explain
it.
This
forced
me
to
go
back
home
and
look
up
this
grammar
rule,
so
that
I
could
later
explain
it
to
her.
That
same
night,
I
emailed
her
the
explanation,
using
some
of
her
own
sentences
to
further
illustrate
my
point.
And,
the
next
week,
when
she
emailed
me
a
revised
draft
of
the
same
paper,
the
majority
of
the
previously
problematic
commas
were
resolved.
Although
I
certainly
notice
smaller
changes
in
my
writing,
I
cannot
say
that
my
overall
writing
process
has
changed
significantly.
Generally
speaking,
I
still
do
some
sort
of
pre-writing,
but
nothing
very
formal;
instead,
I
just
start
writing,
and
see
what
ideas
come
out
the
most
coherently.
In
WA
meetings,
this
is
what
I
advise
my
students
to
do,
as
well.
It
is
not
the
format
of
prewriting
that
matters
D
it
can
be
bulleted,
or
in
paragraphs,
or
mere
words,
as
long
as
that
is
what
helps.
Often
times,
as
I
read
a
studentOs
paper,
what
becomes
apparent
is
that
he/she
has
many
ideas,
but
that
they
pertain
to
different
topics
and
ultimately
to
different
theses.
My
advice
then
is
to
pick
apart
the
paper,
and
place
each
of
these
ideas
into
categories;
in
the
end,
whichever
category
has
the
most
written
underneath
it,
is
probably
the
one
they
should
stick
with
for
their
final
paper.
Looking
even
further
back,
to
when
I
was
the
younger
student
in
WA
conferences,
I
definitely
found
the
idea
of
a
WA
conference
simultaneously
comforting
and
slightly
awkward.
For
the
most
part,
when
I
handed
papers
in
to
my
WA,
I
didnOt
understand
that
they
really
were
being
handed
in
only
to
her,
and
not
also
to
the
professor.
This
meant
that
I
never
submitted
half-finished
or
rough
drafts:
instead,
they
were
polished,
and
almost
ready
to
be
handed
in
for
a
grade.
This,
in
turn,
meant
that
my
WA
had
a
hard
time
picking
out
small
errors
that
could
be
fixed,
since
I
had
already
gone
through
on
my
own
and
fixed
them.
I
remember
my
freshman
year
WAOs
personal
rule
that
all
of
her
meetings
had
to
be
at
least
twenty
minutes
long,
even
when
there
wasnOt
twenty
minutes
worth
of
material
to
discuss.
This
led
to
awkwardly
forced
and
pointless
discussions.
This
has
played
a
major
part
in
my
now
trying
to
hold
WA
meetings
that
are
not
necessarily
short,
but
simply
to
the
point:
although
we
are
allotted
thirty
minutes
for
each
meeting,
most
meetings
do
not
take
up
that
much
time,
and
I
also
do
not
feel
pressure
to
keep
the
students
for
that
long.
That
being
said,
I
have
had
conferences
in
which
students
want
to
discuss
literally
every
paragraph,
sentence
by
sentence;
if
this
is
what
they
are
looking
for,
I
do
not
hesitate
to
help
them
out,
even
if
these
meetings
stretch
over
the
intended
thirty-minute
period.
Ultimately,
I
think
that
WA
conferences
are
greeted
by
similar
emotions
from
both
the
student
writer
and
the
WA.
The
idea
of
a
first
WA
meeting
is
probably
awkward
for
both
parties,
as
neither
knows
the
other.
I
would
imagine
that
the
student
writer
feels
(as
I
did)
a
bit
intimidated
by
the
WA,
especially
since,
for
the
most
part,
the
WA
is
an
older
student.
And,
for
the
WAOs
part,
perhaps
wariness
is
a
more
accurate
term
than
awkwardness:
having
never
met
the
student
nor
seen
much
of
his/her
writing,
he/she
could
turn
out
to
be
absolutely
anybody,
with
any
given
range
of
reactions
to
the
WA.
Post-meeting
emotions
can
obviously
vary,
too:
if
the
meeting
went
well,
a
feeling
of
reward
probably
accompanies
it,
as
the
WA
managed
to
convey
her
message,
and
the
student
accepted
and
understood
it.
The
most
frustrating
thing
for
me,
as
a
WA,
is
when
a
student
shows
up
with
a
completely
haphazard
draft
that
consists
of
a
couple
poorly
written
sentences,
and
an
apology
that
he/she
simply
ran
out
of
time.
Rather
than
wasting
my
time
working
with
a
student
who
has
put
absolutely
minimal
thought
into
his/her
paper,
I
would
rather
that
they
reschedule
the
meeting
for
a
later
date,
when
they
are
prepared
to
develop
an
idea.
I
have
a
vivid
memory
of
my
most
challenging
experience
with
a
student.
One
of
the
students
in
my
assigned
FYS,
a
varsity
basketball
player,
would
routinely
miss
meetings
we
set
up.
He
missed
the
first
meeting
altogether,
hours
later
emailing
me
that
he
had
had
a
last-minute
practice
that
he
wasnOt
allowed
to
miss
and
that
he
was
sorry
for
missing
our
meeting.
We
rescheduled
for
a
couple
days
later,
but
again,
without
notice,
he
failed
to
show.
After
another
such
unsuccessful
attempt
at
meeting,
he
finally
showed
up
to
meet
me
with
a
wrinkled
piece
of
scrap
paper,
on
which
he
had
scrawled
a
couple
of
vague
ideas.
Apologetically
he
told
me
that
he
had
had
a
crazy
week,
what
with
all
of
his
classes
and
basketball
practice,
and
that
he
just
kept
forgetting
about
our
meetings,
and
that
this
was
all
he
had
had
time
to
create.
It
took
everything
I
had
not
to
blow
him
off
when
he
finally
showed
up,
telling
him
to
go
back
and
write
something
coherent.
Instead,
I
sat
down
with
him,
and
had
him
read
aloud
to
me
what
he
had
written
so
far.
What
developed
from
thereon
out
was
an
in
depth
conversation,
during
which
he
took
notes
and
starting
making
a
logical
outline
for
his
paper.
Several
days
later,
he
emailed
me
a
very
polite
email,
asking
if
I
could
look
over
the
paper
he
had
attached
to
the
email
and,
if
I
had
time,
send
him
back
some
comments.
When
I
opened
the
attachment
I
found,
to
my
surprise,
a
full
length
paper,
complete
with
a
title
and
works
cited
page;
I
read
it,
and
found
that
although
it
did
have
technical
errors,
that
it
had
fully
developed
ideas
and
an
interesting
thesis.
This
time,
I
emailed
him
back
with
equally
in
depth
responses,
telling
him
specific
places
where
he
had
done
well,
and
others
where
he
could
improve.
This
just
shows
exactly
how
much
of
a
collaborative
and
reciprocal
experience
a
WA
meeting
is:
effort
from
one
side
will
be
rewarded
with
effort
from
the
other,
and
a
lack
of
attention
or
enthusiasm,
too,
is
sure
to
be
reflected.
So,
ultimately,
this
experience
ended
up
being
highly
rewarding,
although
the
road
to
getting
there
was
anything
but.
