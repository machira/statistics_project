My
Writing
History
When
my
older
sister
and
I
were
young,
we
knew
how
to
answer
the
question,
NWhat
do
you
want
to
be
when
you
grow
up?O
She
wanted
to
be
a
Ncolorer,O
and
I
wanted
to
be
a
writer.
Today,
she
is
an
illustration
major
in
art
school,
and
IOm
an
English
major.
ItOs
funny
how
things
work
out
sometimes,
particularly
because
if
someone
would
have
asked
me
a
year
ago
what
I
planned
to
do
after
college,
I
would
have
expressed
my
interest
in
becoming
a
biologist.
I
never
would
have
thought
IOd
once
again
hope
to
become
a
writer,
as
I
did
when
I
was
eight
years
old.
My
earliest
memory
of
writing
anything
other
than
my
name
occurred
in
first
grade.
I
sat
at
a
desk
in
Mrs.
KalpOs
classroom
in
Center
Grove
School,
writing
a
sentence
with
a
vocabulary
word,
maybe
the
word
office.
I
wrote
in
huge
DONealian
handwriting
on
that
paper
endemic
to
elementary
schools-
large,
soft,
gray
sheets
covered
in
lines
two
inches
thick,
each
with
a
dotted
line
in
the
middle.
I
recall
thinking
that
I
could
be
creative
in
writing
this
sentence-
that
I
could
create
something
entirely
from
my
own
mind.
From
then
on,
Language
Arts
was
my
favorite
school
subject,
with
writing
constituting
a
great
part
of
that
enjoyment.
Center
Grove
was
proud
of
the
book-binding
machine
it
owned.
All
students
composed
their
own
stories,
which
were
converted
into
real
books,
adorned
with
thick
covers
of
cardboard
wrapped
in
patterned
fabric.
The
bookOs
title
was
written
in
puffy
paint
by
a
parent
helper,
a
dedication
was
inscribed
on
page
one,
the
last
page
featured
a
short,
but
serious,
author
biography,
and
each
page
bore
the
authorOs
colorful
illustrations.
I
recall
two
such
creations,
both
written
in
second
grade.
The
first
assignment
involved
a
futuristic
story,
and
my
tale
featured
a
trip
to
a
metropolis
gone
awry.
I
turned
in
a
rough
draft
and
later
received
a
marked-up
copy
from
my
teacher,
who
had
transformed
my
cute,
but
plot-less,
story
into
a
real
story,
complete
with
a
conflict
and
resolution.
The
other
book
featured
a
fable
entitled
How
a
Bee
Got
His
Stinger,
and
naturally,
it
recounts
the
legend
behind
the
beeOs
acquisition
of
his
dreaded
stinger.
To
an
eight-year-old,
these
childish
creations
were
prized
possessions.
To
own
a
physical
representation
of
one
of
my
ideas-
something
that
closely
resembled
one
of
the
real
books
I
loved
to
read-
was
special
and
unique,
particularly
to
an
aspiring
writer.
Beyond
the
classrooms
and
book-binding
machine
of
Center
Grove
School,
I
was
busy
composing
dozens
of
stories
in
my
spare
time.
I
even
attempted
to
bind
some
myself.
One
such
creation
sits
on
my
bookshelf
today.
Made
of
green
construction
paper
stapled
and
taped
together,
the
book
is
called
The
Baby.
The
story
is
six
pages
long
and
features
a
family
of
turtles
as
its
main
characters.
The
book
even
has
a
publisher;
on
the
front
cover,
a
fuzzy
sticker
of
a
troll
and
the
words
NA
Troll
BookO
tell
me
that
it
was
probably
published
by
Troll
Publishers.
As
I
advanced
through
second
and
third
grade,
I
loved
to
write
long,
rambling
stories
about
children
my
age
and
older.
I
usually
opened
with
an
exciting
line
of
dialogue,
and
often,
a
twist
awaited
the
reader
at
the
storyOs
conclusion.
I
stored
pages
of
such
stories
in
Trapper
Keepers
and
folders
and
wrote
them
on
pink
or
white
composition
paper,
occasionally
with
a
teal
or
purple
pen,
and
sometimes
I
created
a
cover
to
accompany
the
story.
As
I
grew
older,
I
even
incorporated
horror
and
science
fiction
motifs
into
these
small
masterpieces.
Many
stories
remain
unfinished
today,
and
others
have
no
conflict
or
resolution,
just
a
protagonist
and
a
detailed
exposition.
I
was
proud
of
my
writing,
and
in
third
grade,
I
stood
in
front
of
my
entire
Language
Arts
class
and
read
aloud
a
10-page
story
about
friends
who
rode
their
bikes
together.
In
fifth
grade,
I
encountered
for
the
first
time
the
essay-
a
writing
form
that
all
soon-to-be
middle
schoolers
dreaded.
In
my
Social
Studies
class,
I
wrote
page-long
essays
that
my
teacher,
who
also
taught
Language
Arts,
often
complimented
and
sometimes
made
me
read
aloud
to
the
class.
To
some
extent,
I
began
to
understand
the
structure
of
an
essay:
an
introduction,
which
usually
restated
the
question,
several
body
paragraphs,
each
with
a
topic
sentence,
of
course,
and
a
conclusion,
which
generally
reiterated
the
introductionOs
content.
Throughout
the
next
three
or
four
years,
my
classmates
and
I
constantly
relearned
the
proper
way
to
write
an
essay,
as
well
as
the
many
types
of
essays
that
populate
the
wide
world
of
academia.
In
seventh
grade,
I
wrote
a
thoroughly
researched
persuasive
essay
on
capital
punishment.
Though
I
thought
the
essay
was
simply
terrific,
I
earned
a
B+
grade
because
I
did
not
provide
a
proper
conclusion.
I
was
angry
with
the
grade
because
1)
it
was
not
an
A;
2)
I
distrusted
my
Language
Arts
teacher,
who
did
her
makeup
during
class
and
frequently
accidentally
spilled
her
coffee
on
the
floor;
and
3)
I
was
impressed
with
my
conclusion-
an
ending
that
would
stick
with
the
reader.
At
that
time,
I
loved
to
conclude
essays
with
a
NkickerO;
this
essay
ended
with
an
authoritative
and
memorable
line
like
NSo
next
time
you
think
about
whipping
out
a
protest
sign,
consider
the
facts
first.O
I
rewrote
the
essay
to
improve
my
grade
but
didnOt
learn
much
from
the
experience.
I
had
been
nurturing
my
own
style
of
creative
essay
writing,
and
today
when
I
write
informal
or
persuasive
essays,
I
still
like
to
end
with
a
kicker-
integrated
into
some
form
of
conclusion,
of
course.
By
eighth
grade,
I
was
fairly
confident
in
my
ability
to
write
well,
but
one
class
forced
me
to
improve
my
skills
on
a
constant
basis.
ACE
was
a
required
course
whose
three
letters
stood
for
something
I
now
forget,
and
each
marking
period
of
the
class
focused
on
a
different
subject.
During
the
first
quarter
of
eighth
grade,
Mrs.
Irwin
sought
to
improve
my
classOs
writing
skills
through
implementing
strict
rules.
We
were
not
allowed
to
use
any
slang
whatsoever,
writing
the
word
get
was
forbidden,
impeccable
grammar
was
a
requirement
for
a
satisfactory
grade,
and
all
essays
had
to
be
handwritten.
This
last
rule
presented
a
particular
challenge,
for
by
this
point
in
my
writing
life,
the
computer
had
become
a
powerful
and
necessary
tool.
Somehow
I
could
better
formulate
my
thoughts
with
a
keyboard,
and
my
sentences
sounded
more
sophisticated
when
typed
in
Microsoft
Word.
With
each
assignment,
my
writing
skills
gradually
improved.
For
assignment
one,
we
had
to
write
a
narrative
describing
our
plans
if
we
knew
the
world
would
end
in
12
hours;
I
wrote
about
my
quest
to
acquire
tickets
to
the
final
Stanley
Cup
game,
featuring
my
favorite
team,
the
New
Jersey
Devils.
I
ended
the
story
in
a
classic
cliffhanger
and
was
proud
of
its
informal,
playful
tone.
My
confidence
was
soon
crushed,
when
I
received
a
score
of
2.8
out
of
4.0:
a
big,
fat
B.
Always
told
I
was
an
excellent
writer,
I
was
accustomed
to
excelling
in
Language
Arts
courses,
so
I
wasnOt
thrilled
to
learn
that
my
writing
didnOt
deserve
an
A.
I
reluctantly
rewrote
the
essay
for
a
better
grade,
replacing
get
with
receive
and
blow
up
with
explode.
For
assignment
two,
a
characterization
piece
about
an
admirable
person,
I
wrote
about
a
favorite
camp
counselor
and
earned
a
slightly
higher
grade
of
3.2:
still
a
B.
Again,
I
revised
the
essay
but
now
felt
more
motivated
than
ever
to
impress
my
teacher
with
the
next
assignment,
a
narrative
completing
the
plot
of
the
short
story
NThe
Lady
and
the
Tiger.O
I
diligently
followed
all
of
Mrs.
IrwinOs
seemingly
crazy
rules
and
was
ecstatic
upon
receiving
the
final
draft
with
a
grade
of
4.0
stamped
on
it.
Through
this
experience,
I
learned
the
important
lesson
that
I
can
always
improve
my
writing.
In
addition,
Mrs.
Irwin
instilled
in
me
greater
discipline
in
my
writing,
and
her
strictly
enforced
rules
remain
valuable
today.
I
generally
avoid
meaningless
verbs
like
get
and
hackneyed,
unoriginal
language,
including
slang
and
clichs,
and
I
meticulously
proofread
my
papers
for
grammatical
errors;
however,
I
still
rely
on
a
computer
for
the
vast
majority
of
my
assignments.
Though
by
eighth
grade
I
had
abandoned
the
bike-riding
stories
of
elementary
school,
I
still
spent
time
writing
on
my
own.
Throughout
middle
school
I
filled
notebooks
with
advertisements
for
fake
products,
lists,
rants
and
raves,
attempted
movie
reviews,
and
quizzes
modeled
off
those
in
teen
magazines.
Here
I
could
express
myself
creatively,
without
worrying
about
grammar,
slang,
contractions,
or
grades.
In
addition,
my
hobby
of
journal
writing
began
during
this
time.
What
seems
like
hundreds
of
journals
are
now
stacked
throughout
my
room,
and
though
this
continuous
exploit
seems
silly
at
times,
writing
often
keeps
my
writing
fresh
and
forces
me
to
think
about
writing
constantly.
These
journals
also
contain
experiments
with
poetry
and
stream
of
consciousness,
as
well
as
many
products
of
NPass
the
Story,O
a
game
my
sister
and
I
created,
in
which
each
player
writes
a
sentence
to
a
continuing
story
before
passing
it
to
the
next
person.
Creativity
is
a
strict
requirement
for
NPass
the
Story,O
the
results
of
which
are
dozens
of
outrageous
two-
to
three-page
stories
with
elaborate
plots,
quirky
characters,
and
plenty
of
middle
school
and
high
school
vocabulary
words.
In
high
school,
NLanguage
ArtsO
became
NEnglish,O
and
my
writing
skills
improved
enormously.
Much
of
this
growth
occurred
during
tenth
grade,
thanks
to
two
important
courses:
English
II
Honors,
a
notoriously
difficult
class
that
aimed
to
weed
out
students
who
couldnOt
handle
a
500-page
vocabulary
book,
and
Creative
Writing.
In
my
English
class
I
learned
how
to
write
a
thesis
paper,
but
I
also
began
feeling
insecure
about
my
writing
due
to
the
fear
and
anxiety
my
demanding
teacher
inspired.
I
pored
over
the
details
of
every
final
draft,
checking
and
re-checking
each
word,
sentence,
and
punctuation
mark.
Two
other
factors
contributed
to
this
attention
to
detail,
aside
from
genetics:
plagiarism
and
grammar.
A
plague
of
plagiarism
swept
through
my
high
school
that
year,
and
at
the
forefront
of
its
extermination
was
my
teacher,
who
instilled
in
her
students
a
sense
of
moral
duty
when
writing
a
works
cited
page;
since
then,
IOve
always
been
attentive
to
citation
issues.
For
grammar
quizzes,
I
memorized
dozens
of
quirky,
nitpicky
rules
and
became
so
fixated
on
grammar
that
I
began
analyzing
sentences
in
my
mind
and
correcting
my
friendsO
common
grammatical
mistakes.
I
still
cringe
when
I
see
or
hear
a
split
infinitive,
but
this
command
of
the
language
has
undoubtedly
strengthened
my
writing.
Creative
Writing
provided
a
stark
contrast
to
my
intimidating,
yet
instructive,
English
course.
Mrs.
McConnell
encouraged
individuality
and
motivated
me
to
write
creatively.
I
received
constant
praise
from
her
and
learned
to
love
both
reading
and
writing
poetry,
after
always
dreading
it.
The
products
of
that
course
included
a
30-page
science
fiction
short
story,
which
unsurprisingly,
begins
with
a
line
of
dialogue;
a
variety
of
poems,
from
the
ode
to
the
villanelle,
several
of
which
appeared
in
the
school
literary
magazine;
and
a
bound
booklet
compiling
that
yearOs
work.
Due
to
my
seriousness
in
school,
especially
in
science
and
math
courses,
I
thought
I
were
incapable
of
writing
creatively
but
fortunately
proved
myself
wrong.
As
a
high
school
sophomore
and
junior,
I
encountered
scientific
writing
for
the
first
time
and
quickly
realized
that
I
had
to
adapt
to
this
writing
style.
Writing
math
essays
in
tenth
grade
was
difficult,
for
IOd
been
focusing
heavily
on
writing
for
English
courses,
in
which
verbosity
and
elaborate
sentence
structure
are
generally
more
accepted
than
they
are
in
math
classes.
I
learned
that
these
essays
were
best
executed
when
written
in
a
logical,
stepwise
manner.
Lab
reports
for
my
biology
classes
also
presented
a
challenge;
I
frequently
wrote
too
much
and
soon
recognized
that
a
concise,
straightforward
style
is
preferred
in
more
scientific
arenas.
In
eleventh
grade,
English
III
AP
further
strengthened
my
writing
skills,
thanks
to
another
tough
teacher,
Ms.
Porrazzo,
who
expected
college-level
writing
from
her
students.
She
encouraged
ample
use
of
figurative
language
and
imagery
in
thesis
papers
and
once
distributed
to
the
class
two
classmatesO
exemplary
essays,
in
hopes
of
encouraging
students
to
emulate
their
peers
and
thus
improve
their
own
writing.
I
donOt
think
this
tactic
was
effective,
for
most
of
my
classmates
seemed
more
puzzled
than
impressed
when
admiring
these
apparently
perfect
papers;
yet
everyoneOs
analytical
skills
and
writing
abilities
undoubtedly
improved
that
year.
Though
writing
assignments
for
this
class
sometimes
inspired
more
fear
than
creativity,
receiving
positive
comments
from
my
teacher
cultivated
greater
confidence
in
my
writing.
Ms.
Porrazzo
nominated
me
for
two
writing
awards
during
the
year,
and
though
I
did
not
win
either
award,
I
was
proud
of
the
recognition
my
writing
received.
An
end-of-year
portfolio
allowed
me
to
experiment
with
many
writing
forms.
Notable
pieces
in
this
collection
included
an
ode
to
challah
bread
entitled
NOf
Challah,O
based
on
Francis
BaconOs
NOf
Studies,O
and
a
rant
about
my
ultimate
pet
peeve-
bad
grammar,
of
course.
At
various
points
throughout
the
project,
we
reflected
on
our
progress,
and
though
at
the
time
I
detested
writing
about
writing,
after
two
years
of
college,
IOve
begun
to
recognize
the
value
of
assessing
oneOs
own
writing.
Two
classmates,
my
mom,
and
my
teacher
all
wrote
glowing
comments
in
reaction
to
the
portfolio;
their
positive
reviews
gave
me
greater
confidence
with
which
to
enter
my
senior
year
of
high
school
English.
This
fun
project
contrasted
with
the
yearOs
strictly
academic
assignments,
and
through
it
I
developed
a
more
informal,
humorous
tone.
In
the
fall
of
2004,
after
four
years
of
difficult
English
courses,
including
two
years
of
AP
English
and
much
exposure
to
writing,
I
felt
prepared
for
college-level
writing.
Though
I
brought
to
college
essays
from
high
school,
to
consult
in
case
of
a
lapse
in
my
writing
skills,
I
never
needed
to
look
at
them,
for
my
ability
to
write
well
was
confirmed
in
my
first-year
seminar
and
in
several
subsequent
English
courses.
After
just
two
years
of
college,
my
writing
style
and
my
view
of
writing
have
changed
greatly.
The
five-paragraph
formula
for
essay-writing
that
my
high
school
favored
was
scrapped
early
in
college,
and
I
discovered
an
appreciation
for
rough
drafts.
While
my
high
school
teachers
rarely
collected
rough
drafts,
my
college
professors
frequently
evaluate
a
rough
draft
before
the
final
draft
is
written.
Rough
drafts
are
sometimes
distressing
because
I
can
be
unreceptive
to
suggested
revisions;
however,
I
have
become
more
accustomed
to
rough
drafts
and
now
value
the
opportunity
they
provide
to
enhance
an
assignment
through
revision.
In
college
I
have
also
encountered
different
writing
styles,
which
have
forced
me
to
stray
from
my
usually
formal
manner
of
writing.
This
past
spring
in
English
250,
for
example,
I
enjoyed
each
assignment
and
was
surprised
by
the
creative,
funny,
informal
essays
that
I
created.
Due
to
the
encouraging
feedback
I
received
from
my
classmates
and
professor,
I
feel
more
confident
in
my
writing
and
am
interested
in
exploring
differing
writing
forms.
This
summer
I
have
delved
into
the
genre
of
scientific
or
technical
writing
as
an
intern
in
the
Scientific
Affairs
department
of
a
medical
communication
company.
I
have
contributed
to
many
projects,
mostly
continuing
medical
education
pieces
for
doctors,
by
writing
Power
Point
slides
and
slide
notes,
outlines,
and
even
a
full-length
essay.
This
experience
has
exposed
me
to
a
technical,
concise
writing
style
that
requires
the
writer
to
fit
much
information
into
few
words.
The
editing
process
is
integral
to
the
success
of
these
projects;
every
word,
punctuation
point,
and
acronym
is
scrutinized
for
accuracy
and
precision.
Though
I
love
the
process
of
rewriting
a
sentence
so
that
it
sounds
exactly
right,
I
donOt
think
I
could
edit
othersO
writing
for
the
rest
of
my
life
because
I
would
miss
writing
on
my
own.
Maybe
thatOs
partly
the
reason
why
I
switched
majors
from
biology
to
English;
coincidentally
two
of
my
most
influential
high
school
English
teachers
did
the
same.
One
was
told
in
college
that
she
wrote
too
well
to
be
a
science
major.
At
the
time,
I
didnOt
understand
that
logic,
but
now
I
think
I
do.
