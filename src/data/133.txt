Returning
WA
writing
assignment--Fall
1997
(Sorry
it's
so
short.
It
has
been
a
slow
year!)
Over
the
past
year,
many
new
experiences
have
influenced
both
my
writing
style
and
my
approach
to
writing.
Not
the
least
of
these
experiences
has
been
working
as
a
WA.
While
helping
students
acquire
writing
skills
and
experience,
I
have
learned
a
lot
about
my
own
writing.
As
a
WA
I
have
learned
to
take
a
step
back
from
my
own
writing;
I
try
to
see
it
objectively,
as
though
I
am
reading
it
for
the
first
time.
To
do
this
successfully,
I
have
found
it
best
to
write
the
assignment,
whether
it
be
a
ten
page
mid-term
paper
of
a
two
page
what-do-you-think
assignment,
and
then
put
it
way
for
a
while.
When
I
come
back
to
it
I
can
usually
read
it
with
new
insight
and
distance.
I
do
this
because
I,
like
probably
many
others,
can
write
something
and
then
read
it
over
and
over
without
seeing
any
grammatical
errors
or
lack
of
logic
in
arguments,
just
because
I
have
read
it
so
often.
By
distancing
myself
I
can
at
least
attempt
professional
WA-ism.
If
my
plan
of
distancing
myself
from
my
paper
fails--if
my
writing
seems
too
awful
or
too
good
to
be
true--I
never
hesitate
to
ask
the
advice
of
my
fellow
WAs.
Sometimes
I
think
that
some
WAs
see
themselves
as
the
final
authority
on
writing.
If
they
cannot
find
mistakes
or
questionable
elements
in
their
writing,
then
there
must
not
be
any.
(These
are
the
ones
who
tend
to
blow
off
their
own
appointments
with
a
WA,
at
least
in
my
experiences.)
But
I
have
found
that
someone
who
is
truly
objective
to
the
paper
makes
the
best
editor.
It
does
not
mean
that
you
have
failed
as
a
WA,
but
that
you
have
learned
as
one.
Along
with
my
work
as
a
WA,
my
writing
has
developed
under
the
influence
of
a
year
of
new
classes
and
professors.
Two
classes,
in
particular,
stand
out.
In
Professor
Briggs'
English
131,
Writing
for
Publication,
I
had
to
learn
a
whole
new
style
of
writing.
Don't
let
the
fact
that
this
is
a
one
hundred
level
class
fool
you.
It
was
one
of
the
most
intensive
classes
that
I
have
taken
at
Lafayette.
I
put
a
considerable
amount
of
time
and
effort
into
it
and
it
was
well
worth
it.
Learning
a
whole
new
style
of
writing
is
hard
to
do
at
any
time,
but
especially
when
you
are
so
thoroughly
trained
in
a
different
style
of
writing.
As
an
English
major,
I
have
spent
three
years
perfecting
(at
least
attempting
to
perfect!)
the
art
of
the
argument.
Most
papers
I
write
have
an
arguable
thesis
that
I
defend
at
all
costs.
If
something
doesn't
quite
agree,
I
discard
it.
Long
complex
sentence
structure
and
eloquent
words
are
often
applauded
in
such
papers.
Not
so
in
journalism!
I
had
to
learn
to
write
in
short,
concise
sentences
with
words
that
the
average
reader
could
understand.
I
could
no
longer
write
for
the
educated
professor
who
knew
the
plot
of
whichever
book
I
wrote
about.
Instead
I
wrote
for
the
average
person,
too
busy
to
read
a
wordy
story,
wanting
to
know
only
the
most
essential
facts.
It
took
a
semester
but
I
finally
got
the
hang
of
it.
I
am
by
no
means
an
expert,
nor
would
I
want
to
write
journalistically
for
a
living,
but
I
can
and
do
incorporate
it
into
my
own
style
of
writing.
I
try
to
be
more
direct
and
concise.
I
try
to
stay
focused
and
eliminate
tangents.
It
does
not
always
work,
as
you
can
probably
tell
from
this
paper,
but
it
is
a
start.
Another
style
of
writing
that
I
had
to
contend
with
came
from
quite
a
different
source.
Throughout
the
course
of
Professor
Lammers'
Contemporary
Religious
Issues
class,
we
read
many
works
by
people
who
deemed
themselves
authorities
on
issues
of
rights
and
religion.
For
both
our
midterm
paper
and
our
final
exam,
we
were
asked
to
answer
questions
concerning
these
issues
from
the
point
of
view
of
an
author
we
had
read.
Not
only
did
I
have
to
remember
what
the
person
said
about
the
issue
but
how
he
or
she
said
it.
Were
they
confident?
Did
they
show
doubt?
Did
they
give
evidence
to
support
their
argument
or
was
the
reader
left
to
take
it
on
faith?
I
found
it
very
difficult
to
write
as
a
person
about
whom
I
knew
nothing,
other
than
what
I
read
in
a
short
reading.
And
while
I
have
never
had
to
use
this
style
of
writing
before
and
do
not
foresee
much
of
it
in
my
future,
it
challenged
me
and
my
writing
skills.
The
exercises
made
me
examine
closely
the
writing
styles
of
published
authors.
It
was
simply
another
way
of
distancing
myself
from
my
own
writing.
I
guess
that
the
best
advice
that
I
can
give
to
new
WAs
is
to
learn
from
your
experiences,
as
both
a
WA
and
a
student.
Don't
be
intimidated
by
your
peers.
You
are
here
because
you
have
good
writing
skills,
communication
skills,
and
the
potential
to
learn.
But
keep
in
mind
that
you
are
not
the
be
all
and
end
all
of
writing,
either.
Don't
be
afraid
to
consult
St.
Martin's
or
another
WA.
And
if
you
have
a
WA
for
a
class
you
are
taking,
don't
stand
her
up.
How
will
our
peers
learn
that
we
are
a
valuable
resource
if
we
don't
show
them?
