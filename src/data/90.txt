My
History
as
a
Writer
Over
the
Last
Year
At
the
beginning
of
my
junior
year
I
felt
relatively
confident
in
my
abilities
as
both
a
Writing
Associate
and
as
a
writer.
I
felt
much
more
at
ease
counseling
students
and
aiding
them
in
their
writing
endeavors
and
had
learned
a
few
things
from
them
as
well.
Last
year
I
was
faced
with
obstacles
in
both
my
personal
writing
and
my
approaches
and
attitudes
as
a
WA.
I
believe
that
I
may
have
written
more
papers
last
year
that
the
rest
of
my
life
combined
and
this
had
a
dramatic
effect
on
my
somewhat
laid-back
manner
of
writing
for
my
classes.
Also
during
this
time
I
was
assigned
as
a
Writing
Associate
for
the
Engineering
Ethics
course.
This
experience
opened
up
a
whole
new
way
to
look
at
writing-
a
technical,
fact-based
approach
that
I
was
relatively
unused
to.
As
well
as
this
novel
view
of
writing
I
encountered
problems
between
myself
and
the
students
in
these
classes.
Stereotypes
about
writing
and
its
usefulness
for
the
Engineering
field
abounded
among
these
students
and
it
was
a
struggle
to
get
some
of
them
to
be
active
in
the
writing
process
and
excited
about
their
writing.
These
two
aspects
of
my
junior
year,
my
experience
as
an
Ethics
WA,
and
the
extensive
amount
of
writing
required
for
my
classes,
shaped
my
view
on
writing.
Despite
the
multitude
of
papers
and
journals
required
by
my
classes
last
year,
my
writing
process
has
remained
very
stable,
with
a
few
minor
alterations.
My
general
approach
to
writing
a
paper
is
to
procrastinate
to
a
dangerous
degree
until
the
pressure
on
my
head
is
so
strong
I
Have
to
write
it
or
take
some
aspirin.
Although
I
may
get
a
late
start,
I
am
always
thinking
about
the
paper
and
how
I
will
approach
the
assignment.
This
mental
process
is
difficult
to
verbalize
but
it
is
almost
as
if
I
have
the
paper
written
in
my
head
and
need
only
to
write
or
type
it
out.
I
do
use
sketch
outlines
but
these
are
so
sparse
as
to
be
incomprehensible
to
anyone
who
can
not
see
my
though
patterns.
Basically,
once
I
have
written
a
paper
it
is
done,
with
the
exception
of
re-writing
conclusions,
introductions,
and
the
necessary
spell
checking.
As
uninteresting
as
this
writing
process
may
appear
it
works
for
me.
I
have
tried
to
change
it
numerous
times
because
the
stress
of
waiting
until
the
last
minute
to
start
writing
can
be
very
exhausting,
but
papers
that
I
have
written
more
that
a
week
ahead
of
time
tend
to
get
so
over-worked
that
I
do
poorly
on
them.
The
mass
influx
of
writing
assignments
I
received
last
year
only
served
to
complicate
my
life
with
procrastination,
not
alter
my
writing
approach.
It
is
very
frustrating
not
being
able
to
change
my
process
because
I
know
it
is
awful.
One
of
my
most
excruciatingly
insane
experience
last
year
was
writing
a
12
page
paper
for
a
Religion
class
in
three
hours
the
day
it
was
due.
One
would
think
that
this
kind
of
experience
would
whip
me
into
shape,
however,
because
I
got
the
grade
I
wanted,
it
did
not.
One
trend
which
I
have
noticed
in
my
writing
dilemmas
began
last
year.
My
interest
in
the
class
and/or
the
assignment
for
the
paper
or
draft
for
a
class
greatly
affect
my
willingness
to
procrastinate
(although
I
would
classify
procrastination
as
more
of
a
disease
than
a
decision).
If
the
assignment
was
provoking
or
I
had
my
mind
was
so
full
of
the
ideas
for
the
paper,
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
to
refrain
from
writing,
while
papers,
especially
research,
which
did
not
excite
me
or
seemed
to
practically
beg
for
BS
to
be
included
became
the
prey
of
my
less
advantageous
writing
approach.
One
of
my
most
influential
writing
experiences
of
last
year
was
the
writing
of
a
group
lab
report
for
an
experiment
we
had
designed
and
conducted
in
a
psychology
class
I
took
second
semester.
This
lab
report
became
our
four-person
group's
living
nightmare
as
it
expanded
from
a
respectable
10
pages
to
around
30
or
35.
The
amount
of
time
spent
revising
and
researching
and
changing
and
crying
in
the
library
was
incalculable
but
the
pay
off
for
out
efforts
was
very
good.
I
think
this
experience
was
very
formative
for
me
because
of
the
team
work
which
was
required.
This
was
the
first
lab
report
for
which
we
had
completely
come
up
with
the
entire
experiment.
The
fact
that
it
could
have
been
publishable
and
interesting
to
the
psychology
academic
community
was
thrilling.
This
also
helped
me
to
hone
my
technical
writing
skills
to
the
APA
format
and
it
was
almost
refreshing
to
collaborate
on
a
paper
where
no
sentence
was
unimportant
and
the
information
and
analysis
were
all
concrete.
My
experience
as
an
Ethics
WA
for
both
semesters
last
year
was
enlightening
and
disheartening
at
the
same
time.
Many
of
the
students
I
encountered
share
Joe
Lafayette's
attitude
that
"writing
just
isn't
an
important
issue
in
my
life
and
I
just
want
to
do
whatever
it
takes
to
get
an
acceptable
grade
so
that
my
parents
won't
make
me
leave
and
stop
drinking".
As
sad
as
it
is
to
try
to
reach
these
people
most
of
them
leave
my
aquaintanceship
without
having
gained
much
by
discussing
various
issues
with
me.
Others
in
the
Engineering
class
are
not
quite
so
distant
but
they
maintain
that,
for
practical
purposes,
focusing
on
writing
is
not
worth
their
time.
This
is
because
they
hold
the
misconception
that,
in
their
chosen
field,
writing
is
secondary,
if
not
peripheral,
to
the
equations
and
comprehension
of
concepts.
These
students
need
a
fast
wake-up
call
to
the
fact
that
writing
is
essential
for
any
major
in
order
to
be
able
to
communicate
their
wonderful
ideas
and
to
be
able
to
present
themselves
as
educated
and
knowledgeable
individuals.
I
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
every
student
I
had
in
those
two
semesters
falls
into
one
of
these
two
unfavorable
categories.
There
were
also
a
number
of
truly
dedicated
students
who
wished
to
discuss
their
writing
in
a
sophisticated
and
interactive
manner.
These
people
also
tended
to
be
the
writers
who
required
the
least
amount
of
help,
yet
they
were
still
trying
to
improve.
I
had
one
particularly
rewarding
experience
with
a
foreign
student
who's
writing
outshines
most
native
speakers.
Despite
his
obvious
proficiency,
this
student
approached
me
for
additional
meetings
for
each
assignment
and
really
seemed
to
appreciate
the
discussions
we
had
about
his
paper
and
writing
in
general.
My
experience
as
an
Ethics
WA
exposed
me
to
a
whole
new
genre
of
writing
in
which
clearly
stated
facts
in
a
stringently
organized
manner
was
held
to
be
the
ideal.
The
highly
structured
fashion
in
which
the
students
were
expected
to
write
appeared
very
forced
and
superficial
to
me
and
it
was
difficult
to
refrain
from
asking
students
not
to
rely
on
the
structure
to
dictate
their
papers.
I
also
experienced
problems
in
that
both
the
students
and
myself
questioned
my
authority
to
discuss
with
these
authors
papers
and
assignments
I
had
never
experienced.
It
was
very
hard
to
convince
some
students
of
the
general
laws
of
writing
which
applied
to
all
genres
when
they
doubted
the
merit
of
advice
coming
from
a
non-engineer.
Because
of
certain
attitudes
I
encountered
in
students
I
had
to
dramatically
change
my
approach
to
conferences.
I
found
myself
working
harder
than
ever
to
involve
the
students
in
writing
papers
for
which
most
seemed
to
lack
enthusiasm.
Many
of
the
issues
we
discussed
in
WA
staff
meetings
we
helpful
in
this
respect
such
as
making
the
student
do
all
the
writing
on
his
or
her
paper
and
asking
many
questions
to
find
the
root
of
what
an
author
meant
to
say.
It
was
very
difficult
to
withstand
the
various
silences
ranging
from
bewildered
to
hostile,
but
this
method
clearly
worked
in
that
most
students,
when
given
time
to
ponder
their
writing
problems,
can
find
the
solutions
on
their
own
and
feel
better
about
this.
One
aspect
of
being
positioned
as
an
Ethics
WA
which
I
especially
found
enjoyable
was
the
extreme
organization
that
the
professors
enforced
in
the
course.
The
papers
were
handed
in
in
class
and
given
to
me
so
that
the
student
was
forced
to
come
to
the
conference
if
only
to
receive
the
draft.
I
think
my
WA
experience,
in
general,
last
year
made
me
question
many
of
my
views
about
writing.
Instead
of
the
rather
lopsided
view
that
writing
is
a
means
of
creativity
and
self-expression
meant
to
engage
the
reader,
I
expanded
my
definition
to
included
a
more
dry
style
which
holds
its
main
purpose
in
educating
and
communicating
ideas
in
an
organized
manner.
I
also
because
painfully
aware,
through
my
WA
experience,
of
the
stereotypes
that
envelop
this
campus
about
writing
and
its
usefulness
to
science
and
engineering
majors.
I
think
that
this
view
stems
from
an
even
greater
problem
which
is
the
respective
negative
views
that
are
exchanged
between
BS
and
AB
majors.
BS
majors
tend
to
view
AB
classes
as
easy,
with
no
real
substance
or
purpose.
AB
majors,
as
well,
seem
to
hold
the
stereotype
that
students
in
the
sciences
can
not
write
and
lack
creativity.
For
these
reasons
our
staff
group
last
semester
attempted
to
organize
a
brown
bag
for
engineering
students
on
the
merit
and
necessity
of
writing.
I
believe
that
both
the
intense
concentration
of
my
classes
on
writing
last
semester
and
my
experiences
in
the
position
of
an
Ethics
WA
have
formulated
for
me
a
different
view
of
writing
which
is
less
judgmental
and
more
flexible.
Although
my
experiences
as
a
WA
last
semester
were
difficult
I
think
that
the
amount
I
gained
from
working
with
these
students
greatly
outweighs
the
negative.
