Reflections
in
Writing
My
first
memory
of
writing,
though
Ium
not
sure
if
I
actually
remember
it
or
if
I
only
think
I
do
because
my
dear
mother
has
mentioned
it
so
many
times,
comes
from
a
poem
that
I
wrote
as
a
child.
It
went
like
this:
I
blew
bubbles.
I
had
troubles.
I
got
one
in
my
eye.
Sadly,
the
aspiring
poet
took
a
backseat
to
other
interests,
leaving
this
undeniable
raw
to
the
wayside
p
neglected,
forgotten,
silenced.
So
sad.
Nevertheless,
writing
has
always
been
something
that
Iuve
enjoyed,
which
probably
shouldnut
come
as
too
much
of
a
surprise.
Unfortunately,
my
strained
adult
memory
canut
conjure
up
all
that
much
from
my
formative
years,
but
Iull
share
the
little
that
it
can.
I
remember
thinking
that
I
was
a
pretty
cool
cat
because
I
never
got
tripped
up
on
run-on
sentences
like
some
of
my
less
fortunate
classmates.
I
also
remember
crying
extensively
in
the
second
grade
when
I
failed
my
first
assignment:
a
reading
quiz
intended
for
third
graders
p
none
of
us
stood
a
chance.
Looking
back,
the
tear
shedding
probably
should
have
raised
a
red
flag
or
two
in
regards
to
the
whole
rcool
cats
business,
but
Ium
not
going
to
complain
that
it
didnut.
Middle
school
rolled
around
and,
as
a
whole,
it
was
just
bad.
During
my
elementary
years,
my
mom
and
dad
had
gone
through
the
painstaking
effort
of
checking
my
homework
every
night.
I
suppose
I
had
proven
myself
as
a
good,
reliable
student
in
their
eyes,
so
they
let
me
act
on
my
own
accord
once
I
hit
sixth
grade.
Things
went
smoothly
for
a
couple
years
because
I
was
a
good
student,
but
by
eighth
grade,
I
had
drastically
cut
down
on
the
amount
of
work
that
I
did
outside
of
class.
A
bright
kid
in
a
public
school
doesnut
need
to
do
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
to
get
good
grades,
and
I
was
beginning
to
catch
on.
In
the
back
of
my
mind
I
felt
like
I
should
have
been
taking
school
more
seriously,
but
watching
midday
reruns
of
Late
Night
with
Conan
OuBrien
seemed
liked
a
pretty
good
idea
too.
Unlike
middle
school,
which
is
mentionable
only
because
it
marks
my
tragic
decline
from
the
hard-working
youngster
that
I
once
was,
high
school
provides
a
very
important
point
of
reference
for
me
as
a
writer.
Prior
to
it,
I
didnut
focus
on
the
writing
process
at
all.
I
simply
wrote,
didnut
mess
up
as
badly
as
everyone
else,
and
went
home
happy.
With
high
school
came
academic
segregation,
and
all
of
the
sudden,
there
were
good
writers
at
every
turn,
and
consequently,
my
academic
strategy
of
half-assing
went
into
a
two
year
remission
as
I
grew
accustom
to
the
new
system.
This
worked
out
for
the
best,
though,
because
my
writing
underwent
a
pretty
spectacular
transformation.
When
I
think
of
the
defining
moment
for
my
evolution
as
a
writer,
it
comes
from
very
humble
means.
I
was
in
eleventh
grade,
taking
my
first
AP
English
class
with
a
teacher
named
Mr.
Howie.
The
fact
that
it
was
an
AP
course
actually
has
very
little
to
do
with
the
anecdote,
because
the
influential
writing
lesson
of
which
I
speak
was
not
a
product
of
the
coursework,
but
rather
the
spawn
of
my
teacherus
frustration
over
our
collective
inability
to
use
a
comma
correctly.
Up
to
this
point,
we
had
all
assumed
that
we
knew
what
we
were
doing
when
it
came
to
commas,
but
our
usage
honestly
proved
quite
atrocious.
The
lesson
was
simple
p
he
covered
appositives,
splitting
independent
clauses,
how
to
deal
with
introductory
clauses,
and
other
things
along
those
lines.
The
results
were
substantial.
As
a
challenge
to
the
class,
he
asked
us
to
use
as
many
of
the
comma
techniques
that
we
could
in
our
next
paper.
I
had
about
as
much
fun
finishing
that
assignment
as
is
humanly
possible
while
writing
an
academic
paper.
I
had
gained
access
to
a
whole
new
repertoire
of
sentence
structure
and
variety.
What
English
lover
wouldnut
have
a
good
time
with
that?
My
junior
year
also
saw
my
return
to
the
poetry
scene.
We
were
given
an
experimental
assignment
designed
to
unleash
the
inner
poet
that
lurks
within
us
all.
The
gist
of
it
was
that
we
would
write
prose
a
topic,
love,
and
then
have
a
classmate
edit
out
anything
that
didnut
feel
poetic.
Unfortunately
for
me,
writing
the
prose
slipped
my
mind
the
night
before,
so
I
had
to
hastily
scrawl
a
paragraph
about
love
in
the
minute
that
I
had
before
class
began.
I
pity
the
poor
guy
who
had
to
edit
it,
because
it
really
was
a
piece
of
garbage.
That
night,
we
were
supposed
to
go
home
with
our
edited
prose
and
transform
it
into
a
poem.
I
remembered
to
do
it
this
time,
but
my
product
turned
out
just
as
dreadful.
Iud
blame
the
poor
foundation
that
I
built
for
myself
at
the
beginning
of
the
assignment,
but
I
feel
as
if
I
was
destined
to
fail
no
matter
what
I
did.
I
simply
hadnut
written
creatively
in
ages
and
was
self
conscious
about
my
feelings
at
the
time,
making
writing
about
love,
of
all
topics,
a
pretty
tough
thing
to
do.
We
turned
in
our
assignments
and
a
few
days
later
he
showed
us
some
of
the
best
that
the
class
had
produced.
As
expected,
mine
was
nowhere
to
be
found.
The
oneus
that
he
showed
were
actually
really
good.
So
good,
that
I
questioned
my
classmates
who
wrote
them.
They
admitted
that
they
ditched
the
original
prose
they
had
written
and
started
a
poem
from
scratch.
Cheaters.
All
of
tem.
When
I
got
my
assignment
back,
I
received
a
grade
a
grade
of
rre-do,s
which
I
begrudgingly
did
to
a
slightly
less
horrible
avail.
With
a
passing
grade
given
only
out
of
pity,
I
disposed
of
my
poem
in
the
nearest
trash
receptacle,
never
to
see
it
again.
Despite
my
best
efforts
to
rid
myself
of
it
for
good,
the
poem
haunted
me
a
year
later
when
Mr.
Howie
stumbled
into
a
poetry-reading
contest
which
I
had
just
been
eliminated
from
and
sarcastically
barked
rA
poetry
contest
and
didnut
win?!
Nois
The
assignment
was
one
of
the
most
dismal
failures
that
I
have
yet
faced
p
a
humbling
experience,
if
I
do
say
so.
My
following
year
saw
some
of
the
most
important
shifts
in
writing.
For
most
of
high
school,
I
had
been
getting
mostly
B+us
and
some
A-ts
which,
while
certainly
acceptable,
wasnut
desirable.
More
and
more,
I
felt
like
I
wanted
to
study
English
in
college,
but
I
wasnut
sure
if
I
could
do
it.
I
remember
going
into
my
senior
year
and
seeing
it
as
a
testing
ground
for
college.
I
thought
that
if
I
diligently
applied
myself
and
got
over
the
B+
hump,
I
could
go
into
college
as
an
English
major
with
confidence.
As
such,
I
tackled
the
first
major
assignment
from
my
new
teacher,
Mrs.
OuPella,
with
a
tenacity
that
I
have
since
been
unable
to
duplicate.
We
had
just
read
a
short
story
by
Gabriel
Garcia
Marquez
and
were
expected
to
write
a
literary
criticism
on
it.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
wrote
the
essay
many
days
in
advance
and
meticulously
went
over
it.
I
even
got
a
good
friend
of
mine
to
look
it
over
a
couple
of
times.
All
of
this
was
pretty
unheard
of
for
me.
My
previous
years,
I
hated
to
proofread
because
I
wasnut
able
to
get
my
essays
exactly
the
way
that
I
wanted
them.
When
I
had
to
submit
my
papers
to
peers,
I
would
always
try
to
pair
up
with
someone
that
I
didnut
care
about
too
much
p
that
way
if
they
gave
me
negative
feedback,
my
friends
would
be
wholly
unaware
of
the
fact
that
I
was
not
a
flawless
writer.
In
short,
my
writing
was
good,
but
not
great,
and
that
bothered
me.
This
assignment
marked
the
first
time
that
I
sat
down
and
stared
my
writing
in
the
face,
wrestled
with
it,
and
then
stared
at
it
some
more.
I
took
the
imperfections
and
tried
to
make
them
the
way
that
I
wanted
instead
of
finishing
the
essay
with
the
resounding
rGood
enough!s
that
I
so
often
do.
I
have
to
admit,
it
worked
out
really
well.
I
got
an
A+
on
the
paper
with
some
encouraging
feedback
from
my
new
teacher.
I
was
brimming
with
pride
because
I
had
given
it
my
all
and
actually
succeeded
p
it
was
a
lot
like
the
ending
of
The
Karate
Kid
except
with
fewer
knee
injuries
and
Crane
Kicks.
Unfortunately,
since
I
got
the
best
grade
that
I
could,
I
had
nowhere
to
go
but
down.
I
had
considered
myself
proven,
so
it
was
back
to
my
old
slacking
ways.
I
suppose
I
assumed
that
if
I
got
into
a
tight
bind
at
college,
I
could
just
conjure
up
the
same
vigor
I
had
used
here.
While
I
didnut
exhibit
the
same
dedication
to
my
writing
that
I
showed
on
my
first
essay,
I
still
made
quite
a
few
improvements
throughout
the
year.
Before
I
get
into
them,
though,
I
think
itus
important
to
explain
my
teacher.
She
was
unlike
any
that
I
had
before,
because
she
would
outright
tell
a
student
that
their
ideas
were
wrong.
This
woman
had
deep-seeded
opinions
on
literature
and
writing
and
rarely
took
interest
in
hearing
opposing
views
unless
they
had
serious
textual
support.
We
all
learned
quickly
that
you
simply
did
not
present
your
homegrown
pet-theories
on
a
text
in
her
class.
She
would
make
you
feel
quite
silly
if
you
did.
Fortunately
for
us,
Mrs.
O
knew
what
she
was
talking
about,
so
while
we
rarely
looked
at
a
text
from
more
than
one
angle,
the
angle
from
which
we
approached
it
was
always
sound.
The
most
useful
lesson
that
she
taught
me,
much
like
the
one
that
had
occurred
the
previous
year,
came
from
an
impromptu
decision
on
her
part
to
correct
a
perceived
error
in
the
classus
writing.
After
reading
our
summer
submissions
(which
occurred
prior
to
the
fabled
essay
that
I
made
mention
of
earlier),
she
was
none
too
impressed
and
demanded
that
we
stop
using
avoidable
rto
bes
verbs,
like
the
one
I
used
earlier
in
this
sentence.
She
claimed
that
they
weakened
writing,
and
it
turns
out
that
sheus
right.
I
noticed
an
encouraging
change
in
my
writing
when
I
cut
down
on
the
number
of
rto
beuss
in
my
papers,
replacing
them
with
more
active
verbs.
When
I
looked
back
at
earlier
works
of
mine,
I
noticed
giant
strings
of
consecutive
sentences
starting
with
the
verb
ris.s
Unacceptable.
I
canut
say
that
I
miss
those
days.
As
if
that
werenut
enough,
she
combined
her
lesson
on
rto
bes
verbs
with
a
second
one
on
proper
tense
p
a
stylistic
one-two
punch
that
left
me
reeling
for
days
as
I
struggled
to
purge
bad
habits
twelve
years
in
the
making.
She
stressed
that
in
a
formal
literary
criticism,
present
tense
was
the
only
tense,
and
that
if
you
ended
up
writing
in
the
past
tense
for
some
other
kind
of
piece,
you
better
stay
there.
Now
to
me,
it
seems
intuitive
to
write
about
literature
in
the
past
tense.
I
read
a
book
a
week
or
so
before
I
write
an
essay
on
it,
so
when
I
sit
down
to
type,
Holden
Caulfield
doesnut
go
to
Mr.
Antolinius
house
p
he
went
there.
He
went
there
last
weeki
when
I
read
it.
Right?
Wrong.
To
be
honest,
Ium
still
kind
of
fuzzy
on
this
one.
If
I
lose
focus
while
writing,
I
find
myself
reverting
back
to
my
old
ways.
Itus
not
an
altogether
rare
occurrence
that
Iull
get
a
quarter
of
the
way
through
and
essay
and
notice
that
the
whole
thing
is
written
in
the
past
tense.
Changing
all
those
verbs
can
be
a
real
pain,
but
itus
a
necessary
one.
After
bringing
up
all
the
great
things
that
Mrs.
OuPellaus
class
did
for
me,
I
feel
itus
important
to
say
that
it
wasnut
all
sunshine
and
grammar
lessons.
As
I
mentioned
earlier,
she
had
some
pretty
strong
opinions,
and
one
of
them
was
that
formalism
was
the
only
viable
point
of
view
for
serious
literary
analysis.
We
glanced
over
historical,
feminist,
and
a
few
other
approaches,
but
were
never
asked
to
experiment
with
them
ourselves.
And
the
deconstructionist
view,
you
might
ask?
She
skipped
that
one
altogether,
believing
it
to
be
a
bunch
of
poppycock
that
stood
as
an
insult
to
literature.
To
this
day,
my
knowledge
of
deconstruction
is
limited
to
merely
what
its
descriptive
name
implies.
I
suppose
you
could
say
I
set
out
for
college
with
a
narrow
scope
of
how
literary
criticism
ought
to
be
done.
I
lacked
no
bit
of
confidence
coming
into
my
freshman
year,
all
the
same.
I
figured
it
would
be
a
lot
like
high
school
but
maybe
a
little
more
work.
To
my
gleeful
surprise,
it
was
a
lot
like
high
school
but
less
work,
if
such
a
thing
is
imaginable.
Okay,
maybe
not
less
work,
but
definitely
less
time.
As
for
writing
specifically,
there
was
an
initial
hurdle
that
I
had
to
jump
during
the
transition
p
my
B+
writing
became
B
writing
p
but
other
than
that,
I
felt
like
any
change
that
existed
in
the
expectations
for
my
college
writing
as
opposed
to
the
writing
that
I
did
in
high
school
came
by
so
gradually
that
I
hardly
noticed
it.
One
thing
professors
seemed
to
emphasize
more
was
having
a
point
to
your
writing,
but
mostly
just
more
in
general
p
more
discussion,
more
explanation,
more
more
more.
In
fact,
you
as
a
reader
might
want
me
to
explain
this
point
more,
but
if
thatus
the
case,
weure
both
going
to
be
disappointed.
The
most
important
thing
that
Iuve
learned
while
being
in
college
is
that
you
get
about
as
much
out
of
writing
as
you
put
in.
Less
and
less
are
things
being
hand-fed
to
me
as
a
student.
While
the
lessons
in
high
school
that
beat
me
over
the
head
with
grammatical
rules
helped
fix
the
errors
in
my
writing,
improving
as
an
actual
writer
has
been
more
about
practice
on
my
own
part
than
anything
else.
The
assignments
that
Iuve
half-assed
the
night
before
they
are
due
havenut
done
anything
for
me.
I
get
a
B
and
some
pointers
that
Ium
not
really
interested
in
because
I
never
invested
myself
into
the
paper.
The
oneus
where
Ium
challenging
myself
with
revision
and
taking
ideas
the
extra
step
p
even
if
they
end
up
in
strange
places
p
have
given
me
the
best
results.
Ium
not
entirely
sold
on
the
idea
that
a
college
education
is
worth
the
money
that
we
all
pay
for
it.
Iuve
definitely
learned
some
great
stuff
while
being
here,
but
I
feel
that
most
of
the
results
come
internally.
Even
in
college,
it
doesnut
take
much
effort
to
pass
a
class
and
Iuve
gone
through
a
few
now
where
I
havenut
learned
much
of
anything.
What
I
am
certain
of,
however,
is
that
I
am
not
nearly
driven
enough
to
take
the
time
to
extensively
teach
myself
without
grades,
professors,
and
due
dates
constantly
nipping
at
my
heels,
so
I
suppose
I
have
that
to
be
thankful
for.
Plus,
a
Bachelorus
Degree
isnut
a
bad
perk
either.
