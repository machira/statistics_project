A
Literary
History
WA
Project
August
15,
1997
I
have
been
waiting
all
my
life--waiting
for
writing
to
become
fun.
Just
one
time,
I
would
like
to
sit
down
and
write
something
for
the
sheer
joy
of
it.
It
seems
as
though
every
time
I
put
words
on
paper
there
are
strings
attached.
I
have
to
write
papers
so
my
professors
know
what
grades
to
give
me.
I
have
to
write
a
narrative
during
the
summer
so
WA's
can
pick
out
my
mistakes.
I
am
waiting
for
a
voice
to
come
from
within
and
inspire
me
to
write
something
that
would
make
me
content.
However,
until
I
can
hear
that
voice,
my
inspiration
must
come
from
others.
Throughout
my
life,
it
has
been
teachers,
relatives,
and
friends
that
have
guided
my
growth
as
a
writer,
and
I
will
continue
to
depend
on
these
people
until
the
day
when
I
sit
down
and
write
something
that
does
not
have
a
due
date.
My
earliest
memory
involving
self-expression
on
paper
is
from
nursery
school.
I
remember
being
given
a
piece
of
graph
paper
and
a
marker,
and
being
told
to
draw
whatever
filled
my
head.
I
thought
of
watching
my
brother's
Little
League
baseball
games,
and
how
happy
I
was
to
be
climbing
on
the
bleachers
and
eating
at
the
snack
stand.
With
this
pleasant
image
in
my
head,
I
drew
a
picture
of
my
impression
of
a
baseball
diamond.
In
fact,
the
picture
appeared
more
like
the
geometric
figure
than
the
actual
playing
field;
yet,
the
nursery
school
teachers
loved
it
and
put
it
on
display.
I
was
extremely
proud
of
my
work,
and
I
showed
it
off
to
my
parents
and
my
brother.
Of
course,
my
parents
loved
it
and
slapped
it
on
the
refrigerator
door.
My
brother,
on
the
other
hand,
disappointed
by
the
loss
of
prime
refrigerator
door
real-estate,
could
only
point
out
that
I
had
drawn
homeplate
backwards.
When
I
made
the
jump
from
drawing
pictures
to
spelling
words
with
letters,
I
faced
some
difficulty.
It
happens
that
I
am
left-handed.
As
the
teacher,
who
was
right-handed,
would
place
each
letter
next
to
one
another
as
her
hand
glided
across
the
board,
I
would
do
the
same
on
my
paper,
only
my
hand
was
moving
in
the
opposite
direction.
Therefore,
each
word
I
wrote
was
backwards,
such
as
my
name,
which
was
changed
to
NEVETS
.
As
this
problem
continued,
some
felt
I
was
dyslexic.
Fortunately,
however,
I
correctly
write
to
learned
eventually.
The
next
hurdle
I
faced
as
my
education
continued
was
learning
to
write
in
script.
Not
only
am
I
left-handed,
as
I
mentioned
earlier,
but
I
also
grip
a
pen
awkwardly,
as
if
someone
were
trying
to
take
it
from
me.
Therefore,
as
I
attempted
to
write
in
the
faster
and
neater
method
of
script,
my
words
and
sentences
became
even
less
legible.
Just
about
every
year
since
the
third
grade,
at
least
one
teacher
has
tried
to
help
me
improve
my
penmanship,
and
every
year,
it
has
failed
to
get
better.
It
is
almost
embarrassing
that
I
have
bad
handwriting.
No
matter
how
bright
an
idea
or
eloquent
a
statement,
when
I
write
it
down
it
looks
like
garbage.
It
is
also
difficult
when
teachers
ask
me
to
hand
in
written
work
or
when
there
are
essays
on
tests,
because
I
often
receive
complaints
about
my
penmanship.
Although,
sometimes
I
think
it
has
helped
me
because
certain
teachers
chose
not
to
tax
their
eyes
by
reading
my
essays
and
just
gave
me
decent
grades.
My
memories
of
the
final
year
of
elementary
school
are
much
clearer
thanks
to
my
sixth-grade
teacher,
Mrs.
DiMeo.
On
the
first
day
of
class
she
gave
each
student
a
notebook,
which
would
serve
as
a
journal.
The
events
of
the
previous
week
were
recorded
faithfully
each
Friday
in
our
journals.
When
I
first
received
this
journal,
I
was
reluctant
to
partake
in
this
exercise
wholeheartedly.
I
felt
that
diaries
were
for
girls,
and
the
only
purpose
they
served
was
to
be
hidden
so
that
friends
and
siblings
could
attempt
to
find
them
in
order
to
learn
one's
secrets.
Each
week,
I
would
write
only
a
few
sentences
in
my
journal,
passing
the
extra
writing
time
by
doodling
pictures
in
the
margins.
Due
to
the
risk
of
it
being
read
by
other
classmates,
I
never
wrote
anything
that
was
personal
or
my
opinions
of
what
was
going
on
in
my
life
at
the
time.
Today,
I
wish
I
had
included
these
things.
This
journal,
which
remains
in
my
room,
serves
to
bring
my
sixth
grade
year
to
life
with
descriptions
of
roller-skating
parties
and
accounts
relating
to
the
tribulations
of
being
a
safety
patrolman.
When
I
read
these
short
stories,
I
cannot
help
but
think
how
much
fuller
my
memories
would
be
had
I
continued
to
keep
such
a
journal.
However,
once
sixth
grade
ended,
so
too
did
the
journal,
thus
leaving
future
remembrances
to
rest
at
the
whim
of
my
memory.
When
I
think
of
middle
school
in
terms
of
writing,
the
images
that
flash
before
me
are
those
tree-like
figures
which
my
classmates
and
I
used
to
diagram
sentences.
This
exercise
was
used
to
show
the
basic
elements
of
grammar
and
the
relationship
between
the
parts
of
speech
in
the
English
language.
English
classes
in
those
two
years
revolved
around
thick,
rectangular
grammar
books
that
were
similar
to
The
St.
Martin's
Handbook,
and
rarely
did
we
read
a
story
or
write
a
creative
piece.
However,
now
that
I
reflect
upon
them,
those
two
years
seem
to
have
been
most
valuable
in
shaping
my
writing
ability.
As
a
result
of
that
intensive
study
of
grammar,
I
was
well
trained
in
the
basic
components
of
writing,
therefore
making
it
easier
for
myself
to
pursue
more
complicated
patterns
of
expression
and
to
stretch
my
writing
capabilities.
Often,
in
trying
to
sound
more
intelligent
by
writing
an
intricate
expression,
I
forget
the
basics
that
were
taught
to
me
in
middle
school.
Although
they
were
not
the
most
interesting,
now
when
I
think
about
it,
middle
school
English
classes
were
possibly
the
most
important.
In
my
opinion,
being
a
Writing
Associate
has
a
lot
to
do
with
having
a
firm
grasp
of
grammar
which
was
taught
in
earlier
levels
of
education.
In
order
for
us
to
help
others,
we
should
be
proficient
at
using
the
laws
of
the
English
language
to
express
ideas
clearly.
Never
was
this
more
evident
to
me
than
when
I
became
a
tutor
in
high
school.
I
was
assigned
to
help
a
young
boy
from
the
Virgin
Islands.
A
bright
student,
he
was
doing
well
in
all
of
his
subjects
with
the
exception
of
English.
As
a
seventh
grader,
he
was
involved
in
the
same,
intense
study
of
grammar
that
I
described
in
the
previous
paragraph.
At
first,
I
was
extremely
bored
as
we
pored
over
the
various
rules
found
in
the
textbook.
However,
one
day
when
I
attempted
a
writing
assignment
soon
after
a
tutoring
session,
I
found
that
it
was
easier
for
me
to
write.
I
discovered
that
by
studying
grammar
and
practicing
it
with
another,
I
became
a
better
writer.
As
the
boy
from
the
Virgin
Islands
improved
in
his
writing
ability,
so
too
did
I.
In
high
school,
I
preferred
classes
that
emphasized
reading
and
writing
as
opposed
to
math
or
science
classes.
It
seemed
that
in
high
school,
the
longer
a
paper
was,
the
better
grade
it
received.
Therefore,
for
most
classes,
I
simply
would
write
as
much
as
I
could
about
any
given
subject
and
hope
that
what
the
teacher
was
looking
for
could
be
found
in
what
I
had
written.
Born
in
high
school
was
the
write
too
much
and
then
chisel
it
method
of
writing
that
I
sometimes
use
today.
Although
I
have
done
well
so
far
using
this
method,
I
find
that
I
often
take
too
much
time
writing
unnecessary
things
or
cut
out
important
information.
I
hope
that
by
the
time
I
graduate
from
Lafayette,
I
will
have
improved
my
writing
ability
and
will
be
able
to
focus
my
writing
on
what
is
important.
I
learned
in
high
school
that
if
you
are
a
decent
writer,
more
responsibility
falls
into
your
lap.
When
working
on
group
projects,
I
often
found
myself
in
charge
of
summarizing
everyone's
ideas.
In
lab
classes,
I
usually
had
to
field
the
questions.
My
classmates
were
not
the
only
ones
who
called
on
me
to
write
something
for
them.
After
our
football
team
won
the
New
Jersey
State
Championship
during
my
junior
year,
we
were
invited
to
Trenton
in
order
to
be
recognized
before
the
Assembly.
When
asked
to
prepare
a
proclamation,
my
coach
admitted
to
me
that
his
writing
ability
rested
solely
on
X's
and
O's
and
then
asked
me
to
prepare
the
speech
for
him.
Under
pressure,
I
wrote
the
speech,
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
success.
I
am
convinced
I
received
more
playing
time
my
senior
year
because
of
it.
When
I
entered
my
freshman
year
at
Lafayette,
I
did
not
worry
about
the
volume
of
work
I
would
receive.
I
had
a
pretty
tough
schedule
in
high
school,
and
I
had
written
ten
page
labs
and
twenty
page
term
papers
before.
What
I
did
worry
about,
though,
was
how
my
work
would
be
received.
I
wondered
if
teachers
in
college
were
like
teachers
in
high
school.
Did
they
give
you
second
or
third
chances?
Would
they
meet
with
you
on
an
individual
basis
if
you
had
a
question
about
a
certain
assignment?
Although
I
found
that
teachers
were
always
accessible
and
often
flexible,
I
learned
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
easy
A
.
In
some
classes,
I
would
write
what
I
thought
were
the
best,
most
well-thought
out
papers
I
had
ever
written,
only
to
receive
low
grades.
I
learned
that
in
college,
how
much
you
have
written
and
how
grammatically
correct
it
is
matters
little
unless
you
have
a
clear
idea
of
the
question
that
is
supposed
to
be
answered
and
the
point
that
you
wish
to
make.
I
also
learned
that
different
classes
call
for
different
styles
of
writing.
One
would
not
write
matter-of-factly,
as
they
would
a
history
paper,
if
he
or
she
was
writing
a
theory
paper,
which
relies
heavily
on
the
author's
opinions.
I
have
also
learned
that
writing
is
a
dynamic
process
When
we
perfect
our
work
through
the
process
of
editing
and
revision,
a
mediocre
paper
lacking
direction
and
sound
grammar
can
turn
into
a
masterpiece.
Although
writing
still
cannot
be
found
in
my
top
ten
list
of
interesting
activities,
I
realize
how
important
writing
actually
is.
Even
though
I
do
not
have
a
grin
on
my
face
when
I
am
sitting
at
the
word
processor,
perhaps
someone
else
will
smile
when
they
read
what
I
have
written.
Writing
is
a
building
block,
a
means
to
make
us
better
at
other
things
which
we
do.
I
realize
that
all
these
writing
exercises
with
strings
attached
have
an
important
purpose:
to
make
me
a
better
writer
I
relate
writing
to
practices
in
sports.
Granted,
not
many
people
like
to
practice,
but
when
it
comes
to
game
time,
those
who
have
practiced
most
and
tried
their
hardest
will
see
the
best
results.
All
the
teachers
I
have
had,
since
nursery
school
have
encouraged
me
to
work
to
my
potential
and
to
improve
my
writing
ability.
The
term
papers
and
lab
reports
were
not
intended
to
be
fun--they
were
intended
to
make
me
a
better
writer.
The
joy
in
writing,
I
believe,
comes
from
being
able
to
write
well
with
ease.
Hopefully,
as
I
encounter
more
writing
challenges
in
the
future,
I
will
reach
this
step
and
the
wait
will
be
over.
