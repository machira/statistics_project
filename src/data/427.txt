Sitting
here
on
the
living
room
couch
with
my
laptop
appropriately
balanced
on
my
lap,
I
stare
at
the
white
screen
of
the
computer
and
reflect
on
the
earliest
writing
experience
I
can
truly
recall.
I
remember
kneeling
on
my
dining
room
floor,
peering
out
the
window
at
the
white
snow
piled
outside.
With
my
brand
new
notebook
with
kittens
on
the
cover
propped
up
on
the
window
ledge,
I
suddenly
felt
inspired
to
write
poetry.
With
the
words,
NA
foot,
a
foot
of
fun/
ItOs
here
for
everyone!O
my
poetry
notebook
began.
Though
I
canOt
exactly
place
this
memory
at
a
specific
time,
I
know
that
it
was
in
the
mid-years
of
elementary
school.
For
many
years,
poetry
was
my
passion:
poetry
in
the
sense
of
cute
little
phrases
with
perfect
rhymes
about
the
simple
things
I
loved:
the
outdoors,
pets,
my
family,
holidays
and
other
such
topics
upon
which
the
life
of
an
under-ten
year
old
girl
might
revolve
around.
Though
my
range
of
topics,
genres,
techniques,
and
writing
skills
has
thankfully
broadened,
writing
still
provides
a
similar
benefit
as
it
did
with
that
early
experience:
a
release,
a
mode
of
expressing
myself,
a
form
of
communication
often
louder
than
spoken
words.
Though
my
poetry
notebook
is
the
earliest
writing
experience
I
can
remember,
I
have
evidence
of
even
earlier
works
by
myself.
My
mother,
who
saves
every
Nimportant
projectO
I
ever
attempted,
has
enabled
me
to
look
back
at
my
first
steps
towards
becoming
a
writer.
There
are
the
sheets
of
paper
where
the
top
is
empty
white
space
and
the
bottom
has
wide
lines
so
that
young
children
can
draw
pictures
and
then,
below
the
artwork,
explain
in
writing
what
the
drawing
is
supposed
to
depict.
Apparently,
I
created
several
books
on
such
paper,
including
one
about
a
zoo
where
all
of
the
animals
have
names
that
use
the
technique
of
alliteration
(ex.
Ellie
the
Elephant)
though
I
certainly
did
not
know
what
that
meant
at
the
time.
There
are
also
the
books
I
made
in
Kiddie
Korner
(aka
Nursery
School)
that
were
put
together
in
a
similar
fashion.
Accompanying
my
drawings,
I
attempted
to
write
a
story
and
then
the
teacher
would
write,
under
my
writing,
the
corrected
version
of
what
I
was
trying
to
say.
Despite
the
teacherOs
assistance,
it
was
clear
the
stories
were
my
original
creations,
involving
characters
from
Sesame
Street,
including
Cookie
Monster
(my
favorite!),
and
another
story
about
the
wild,
baby
rabbits
that
were
born
in
a
nest
in
our
front
yard.
Like
my
poetry
notebook,
these
stories
encouraged
creativity,
allowing
me
to
use
my
imagination
and
go
in
whatever
direction
I
chose.
Later
in
Elementary
School,
I
learned
how
to
write
based
on
instruction.
The
first
specific
writing
assignment
I
remember
was
the
requirement
to
write
a
personal
narrative
or,
as
my
teacher
described
it,
a
true
story
from
your
own
life
where
you
can
and
must
use
the
word
NIO.
I
wrote
about
my
memory
from
kindergarten
when
I
was
called
out
of
class
to
the
office
to
find
out
that
my
mother
had
given
birth
to
my
little
brother.
My
writing
memories
from
Middle
School
reflect
general
growth
in
my
understanding
of
writing
as
opposed
to
specific
examples.
I
remember
important
instruction
such
as
lessons
on
writing
thesis
statements
and
topic
sentences.
I
also
remember
being
introduced
to
the
concept
of
writing
a
distinct,
five-part
paper.
The
three
general
parts
were
the
introduction,
the
body
and
the
conclusion:
in
other
words,
the
beginning,
middle,
and
end.
However,
the
complexities
grew
upon
a
closer
look
at
the
body
section
which
itself
consisted
of
three
main
parts.
These
three
parts
would
be
the
three
main
arguments
of
your
paper,
supporting
your
thesis
(given
at
the
end
of
the
intro)
and
then
reemphasized
and
tied
together
in
a
powerful
concluding
paragraph.
While
this
newly
defined
concept
for
writing
an
argumentative
or
persuasive
essay
seemed
to
me
much
more
sophisticated
than
my
freestyle
creative
writing,
my
teachersO
mode
of
remembering
this
technique
was
hardly
intellectual.
We
were
told
to
think
of
the
three
parts
of
the
body
section
as
NBing,
Bang,
and
Bongo,O
and
we
actually
had
worksheets
where
we
would
fill
in
what
we
planned
to
use
for
each
of
these
allotted
spaces.
In
my
three
years
of
middle
school,
I
became
quite
the
expert
at
this
five-part
way
of
writing.
My
high
school
experience
with
writing
was
like
the
high
school
experience
with
everything
else:
lots
of
new
options,
contradictions
in
advice,
different
opportunities.
No
longer
was
the
five-part
paper,
which
I
had
become
incredibly
attached
to,
the
only
recommended
form
of
writing.
As
my
one
teacher
put
it,
NIf
you
only
have
a
Bing
and
a
Bang,
thereOs
no
point
in
making
up
a
Bongo
just
for
the
sake
of
having
one!O
On
one
hand,
this
new
freedom
was
encouraging,
allowing
me
to
again
write
more
of
what
I
personally
felt
was
needed.
On
the
other
hand,
this
flexibility
was
challenging;
no
longer
could
I
merely
fall
back
on
the
standard
mold.
I
had
to
think
about
what
I
wanted
to
write,
what
I
wanted
to
argue,
and
then
go
with
what
I
thought
was
wisest.
This
chance
to
make
decisions
also
allowed
for
a
greater
window
of
criticism.
However,
much
to
my
happiness,
my
teachers
continued
to
praise
my
writing,
and
contently,
I
regained
my
confidence
in
my
ability
to
whip
out
a
good
paper.
With
the
new
flexibility
in
style
and
form
came
new
assignments
of
varying
genres.
In
high
school,
I
was
required
to
write
many
more
research
and
scientific
based
papers.
This
genre
was
harder
for
me
to
like
because
it
felt
much
less
personal,
and
I
often
found
myself
writing
about
topics
that
barely
(if
at
all)
peaked
my
interest.
Journalism
class
provided
me
with
various
new
opportunities
for
writing
in
different
styles.
I
had
to
write
concise,
factual
articles,
which
proved
to
be
much
more
difficult
than
I
imagined.
It
was
in
journalism
class
that
I
realized
just
how
wordy
my
writing
can
be.
These
articles
with
specific
word
counts
helped
me
to
recognize
a
weakness
of
mine
in
getting
to
the
point.
Perhaps
my
favorite
writing
style
I
developed
on
the
newspaper
staff
was
that
of
the
editorial.
Though
I
had
written
persuasive
papers
as
class
assignments
before,
the
editorials
mostly
dealt
with
much
more
personal
topics.
Instead
of
writing
about
worldly
issues
such
as
saving
the
rainforests,
the
death
penalty
and
other
such
topics
that
involve
worthy
causes
yet
often
fail
to
relate
to
teenage
students,
I
wrote
about
problems
in
the
cafeteria,
studentsO
clothes,
gossip,
and
also
articles
involving
religion,
values,
and
choices.
While
I
had
fun
writing
these
articles,
they
also
made
me
slightly
uncomfortable
because
I
was
putting
a
part
of
me
out
there
for
the
whole
school
to
read,
inviting
criticism
on
something
I
personally
believed.
The
struggle
between
wanting
to
express
and
defend
what
I
believe
versus
being
accepted
and
receiving
praise
continues
to
be
a
concern
with
my
writing.
While
journalism
was
a
great
learning
experience
for
me,
my
teacher
for
junior
and
senior
year
English
was
the
most
brilliant
teacher
I
ever
had.
His
intent
focus
on
not
only
the
technical
and
grammatical
aspects
of
our
writing
but
also
on
our
skill
at
expressing
our
voice
significantly
helped
me
to
develop
my
writing.
He
would
often
give
us
several
options
for
paper
topics,
allowing
us
to
select
the
angle
that
we
could
most
relate
to
in
terms
of
the
novel
we
had
just
completed.
Writing
analytical
essays
about
the
books
we
had
read
quickly
became
a
favorite
writing
style
of
mine
and
remains
so.
This
teacher
also
expanded
my
ability
to
think
and
write
quickly.
Though
I
thoroughly
enjoy
the
advantages
of
a
computer
word-processing
program,
I
remain
an
adherent
to
the
brainstorming
process
I
was
taught
already
in
elementary
school.
I
can
rarely
write
a
paper
without
first
sitting
down
with
my
pencil
and
paper
and
scratching
out
a
general
outline
of
the
main
points
I
want
to
address.
For
me,
this
process
of
outlining
first
helps
me
to
toss
around
ideas
so
that
when
I
sit
down
at
the
computer
my
mind
is
not
as
blank
as
the
screen.
Still,
I
often
found
myself
stuck
when
attempting
to
start
my
papers;
getting
started
is
always
the
most
difficult
part.
Though
I
still
struggle
with
overcoming
that
initial
brain
freeze,
my
high
school
teacher
helped
me
to
work
through
this
weakness
by
requiring
us
to
write
several
in-class
essays.
While
these
timed
in-class
writings
helped
us
prepare
for
the
Advanced
Placement
exam,
they
also
helped
me
to
learn
how
to
think,
and
write,
on
my
feet.
These
in-class
essays
also
made
me
even
more
grateful
for
the
ease
of
typing
a
paper
on
the
computer.
No
more
hand
cramps
and
perhaps
the
greatest
features
of
all,
the
spell
check
and
the
thesaurus
made
my
computer
my
new
best
friend.
While
I
always
had
a
paper
dictionary
and
thesaurus,
I
made
minimal
use
of
these
resources.
However,
when
the
programs
were
right
there,
a
mouse
click
away,
my
use
quickly
increased.
Though
I
tend
to
be
a
good
speller,
the
convenience
of
the
automatic
spell
check
and
corrections
allows
me
to
type
faster
and
not
worry
about
those
tiny
mistakes
that
the
computer
fixes.
(And
thanks
to
the
insistence
of
my
high
school
teacher,
I
have
become
obsessed
with
the
necessity
of
extensively
editing
my
paper
once
I
have
initially
finished
writing
it
so
that
I
can
catch
the
mistakes
that
the
computer
did
not
pick
up
on.)
My
use
of
the
thesaurus
has
truly
improved
my
writing.
While
the
thesaurus
itself
has
been
helpful
in
working
through
those
moments
when
that
perfect
word
just
wonOt
come
to
me,
it
has
been
more
beneficial
as
a
mode
of
awareness.
The
thesaurus
feature,
along
with
the
instruction
of
several
of
my
teachers,
has
convinced
me
of
the
importance
of
word
choice
or
language.
Yet
as
effective
as
the
thesaurus
was
in
showing
me
that
the
difference
between
two
words
can
make
a
huge
difference,
nothing
was
as
effective
in
convincing
me
of
the
power
of
language
and
also
the
general
room
for
improvement
in
my
writing,
as
one
of
my
early
college
writing
experiences.
I
went
through
my
freshman
year
writing
classes
with
general
ease.
Skipping
college
writing
thanks
to
my
AP
exam,
I
started
with
English
205.
The
professor
in
this
class
mistook
me
for
a
sophomore
and
asked
who
had
trained
me
to
write
in
my
freshman
year.
I
explained
to
this
professor
that
it
was
my
high
school
teacher
who
had
prepared
me
so
well,
and
I
confidently
went
about
my
writing.
Then
in
my
American
Studies
class,
it
came
time
to
peer
edit
our
early
drafts
of
our
final
papers.
These
papers
required
an
extensive
amount
of
research
and
sources
but
also
asked
us
to
make
a
personally
developed
argument
and
defend
our
stance.
When
it
came
time
to
exchange
papers
with
the
other
students
in
our
small
peer-editing
groups,
I
felt
sure
that
my
paper
was
on
its
way,
practically
ready
to
turn
in.
The
shock
of
my
paperOs
weakness
was
immediate
as
soon
as
I
looked
at
the
other
two
studentsO
paper.
My
writing
style
was
much
more
casual,
and
basically,
my
paper
was
simply
not
of
the
caliber,
in
terms
of
focus,
flow,
and
clarity,
as
the
papers
of
the
other
students.
I
quickly
realized
that
my
habit
of
just
quickly
turning
out
a
NgoodO
paper
would
no
longer
carry
me
through
school.
I
spent
hours
upon
hours
revising,
editing,
reorganizing
and
fine-tuning
this
paper.
In
the
end,
I
was
pleased
though
not
thrilled
with
the
final
product.
I
learned
I
had
much
more
growing
to
do
in
terms
of
my
abilities
as
a
writer.
Last
year,
I
again
had
an
American
Studies
course
and
found
myself
writing
a
paper
similar
to
the
one
that
I
had
struggled
to
bring
up
to
par.
However,
this
time
I
made
use
of
the
valuable
lessons
I
had
already
learned
at
college.
I
invited
the
criticism
that
I
found
so
hard
to
shoulder
because
I
knew
that
it
was
only
in
taking
this
advice
and
reflecting
on
its
use
in
my
paper
that
my
writing
would
improve.
I
conferenced
with
my
professor
about
my
final
paper,
and
I
attended
the
optional
group
editing
sessions
that
my
professor
provided.
Though
I
can
think
of
a
whole
list
of
other
activities
I
would
have
preferred
to
sitting
around
the
quad
with
a
few
of
my
fellow
students
on
a
sunny
day
at
the
end
of
the
semester
and
discussing
our
final
papers,
I
know
without
a
doubt
that
that
opportunity
helped
me
to
develop
my
paper
as
I
had
desired.
Reflecting
on
my
experiences
as
a
writer,
I
realized
that
my
best
memories
and
the
times
when
I
wrote
the
most
effective
papers
were
the
times
when
I
wrote
about
something
personal
to
me.
Probably
the
greatest
difference
between
my
ability
to
write
my
first
American
Studies
final
paper
as
compared
to
the
most
recent
is
that
in
the
better
paper
I
chose
a
topic,
the
American
failure
to
act
in
the
Rwandan
genocide,
that
really
struck
a
personal
note
with
me.
Looking
back
at
the
process
I
have
found
for
writing
a
solid
paper
that
communicates
my
point,
I
realize
how
far
I
have
come
in
my
understanding
of
writing.
From
my
early
days
of
writing
sing-songy
poetry
to
my
most
recent
semester
analyzing
Victorian
poetry,
my
writing
has
developed
into
possibly
the
best
way
I
have
to
express
my
thoughts
and
communicate
my
position
on
what
I
have
learned.
