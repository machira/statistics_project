Literacy
Narrative
I
remember
sitting
on
the
couch.
I
remember
being
in
my
familyOs
quaint
cabin
in
New
Hampshire.
I
was
eight
years
old,
and
I
was
inspired.
Not
inspired
to
simply
make
more
mud
pies
or
run
around
the
house
yelling,
but
inspired
to
write.
It
was
the
first
time
I
experienced
this
feeling.
It
was
different
because
I
didnOt
just
want
to
write
my
name
in
pretty
letters
or
create
a
note
for
my
dad,
but
felt
compelled
to
create
a
unique
and
intricate
story.
I
had
all
these
creative
and
imaginative
thoughts
piled
up
in
my
toddler-sized
body,
and
finally
knew
what
I
wanted
to
do
with
them.
So,
I
sat
down
with
a
blue
pen
and
a
pad
of
yellow
lined
paper
and
wrote
down
the
profound
title
of
my
ingenious
first
work
of
fiction:
Willy
the
Walrus
and
His
Blue
Hat.
Needless
to
say,
I
ended
up
spending
the
majority
of
my
time
perfecting
the
illustration
on
the
cover
page,
but
I
do
believe
I
got
a
few
sentences
down
before
getting
distracted
by
the
alluring
smell
of
dinner.
Even
though
it
didnOt
become
a
New
York
Times
Bestseller,
I
was
still
proud
of
my
extremely
short
story.
After
completing
my
first
story,
I
became
obsessed
with
dreaming
up
colorful
stories
and
manipulating
words
into
interesting
sentences.
I
also
liked
the
support
and
attention
my
family
gave
me
upon
reading
my
story.
To
this
day,
my
first
story,
all
three
sentences
of
it,
and
the
intricate
cover
page
hang
in
my
cabin
in
New
Hampshire
as
a
reminder
to
me
of
what
it
feels
like
to
be
inspired
to
write.
In
Elementary
School,
I
was
required
to
write
stories
a
bit
longer
than
three
sentences
and,
much
to
my
dismay,
without
an
elaborate
cover
page.
A
particular
assignment
that
stands
out
in
my
memory
was
one
that
required
us
to
select
an
inanimate
object
and
describe
the
way
it
might
experience
the
world.
A
million
ideas
instantly
rushed
into
my
head,
especially
upon
hearing
my
teacher
urge
us
to
be
as
creative
as
possible.
The
idea
that
I
chose
was
a
story
about
a
little
button
that
gets
lost
and
eventually
travels
all
over
the
world
by
being
passed
from
stranger
to
stranger.
Pencil
and
paper
in
hand,
I
began
to
describe
a
little
girl
who
loses
a
button
on
her
overalls
after
playing
with
her
younger
sibling
on
the
playground.
The
adventure
begins
when
a
family
visiting
from
Australia
picks
up
the
button
and
decides
to
take
it
back
down
under
with
them.
The
story
continued
like
this
with
the
button
traveling
all
over
the
world,
only
to
find
his
way
back
to
his
original
owner.
This
was
the
first
time
I
successfully
completed
a
story
and
I
was
exhilarated.
I
felt
like
I
was
swooshing
a
basket
every
time
I
picked
the
perfect
word
and
created
intricate
twists
and
turns
in
my
story.
I
remember
my
teacher
telling
me
that
she
loved
it
and
reading
her
comments
put
me
on
cloud
nine.
Writing
made
me
feel
good
and
knowing
that
otherOs
enjoyed
it
made
it
even
better.
Throughout
my
toddler
and
pre-teen
years,
I
created
dozens
of
imaginative
and
unique
pieces
of
fiction.
This
all
changed,
however,
when
we
were
assigned
a
new
fearsome
task:
A
book
report.
Just
when
I
had
gotten
used
to
unleashing
my
imagination
on
paper,
I
was
forced
to
harness
this
desire
to
summarize
an
autobiography
on
the
famous
person
of
our
choice.
I
chose
Eleanor
Roosevelt.
Instead
of
having
to
decide
what
to
name
my
main
character
and
how
to
describe
them,
I
had
to
use
a
piece
of
non-fiction
to
write
a
report
highlighting
the
life
and
achievements
of
Mrs.
Roosevelt.
It
took
me
a
while
to
fully
adjust
to
this
style
of
writing,
but
I
eventually
found
it
easier.
I
didnOt
have
to
make
creative
decisions
or
strive
to
create
an
interesting
story;
I
just
had
to
do
a
good
job
of
describing
someoneOs
life.
It
was
my
first
taste
of
research
writing,
and
I
enjoyed
it.
During
my
freshman
and
sophomore
years
in
high
school,
I
disliked
writing.
As
a
result,
my
papers
were
desultory
and
weak.
My
teachers
always
gave
me
a
hard
time
about
my
grammar
and
punctuation
and
I
found
it
quite
frustrating.
English
seemed
so
tedious
and
subjective;
in
my
math
classes
I
could
see
why
I
got
a
B,
but
in
my
writing
classes
there
would
be
no
marks
and
just
a
letter
grade.
I
hated
the
enigmatic
grades
and
the
fact
that
my
grade
depended
on
whether
the
teacher
liked
my
style
of
writing
or
not.
Therefore,
I
decided
to
focus
on
science
and
mathematical
classes.
I
felt
comfortable
in
those
classes
because
I
could
study
formulas
and
do
problems
to
practice
but
I
felt
like
there
was
no
real
way
to
study
or
prepare
myself
for
an
in-class
essay.
I
eventually
learned
that
to
study
and
prepare
for
English
tests
and
essays
you
must
simply
make
writing
a
habit.
Throughout
high
school,
the
teachers
and
administration
stressed
the
importance
of
being
prepared
for
college
level
writing.
Therefore,
we
were
required
to
experience
all
different
genres
or
writing.
In
tenth
grade,
I
probably
faced
my
most
difficult
writing
assignment:
a
fifteen-page
research
paper.
As
a
child,
I
really
enjoyed
creative
writing
and
as
a
teenager,
I
started
to
enjoy
literary
analysis.
Thus,
the
idea
of
writing
fifteen
pages
analyzing
and
reporting
on
a
specific
topic
was
stressful.
The
assignment
outlined
the
important
areas
to
cover
and
required
us
to
use
at
least
ten
hard
copy
sources.
I
chose
the
topic
of
blood
diamonds.
The
assignment
was
heavily
structured
which
made
it
difficult
for
me
to
write
freely.
I
was
so
concerned
with
meeting
all
the
criteria
and
using
the
correct
sources
that
I
didnOt
take
the
time
to
write
beautifully.
The
end
result
was
forced
and
poorly
written
and
despite
the
fact
that
I
got
a
B-,
I
felt
like
I
had
failed.
Things
changed
in
eleventh
grade,
however,
upon
meeting
an
English
teacher
named
Mrs.
Lanza.
She
wasnOt
the
most
popular
teacher,
but
is
one
of
the
people
responsible
for
the
level
my
writing
has
reached
today.
I
also
credit
her
with
showing
me
the
beauty
and
power
in
eloquent
writing.
Before
her
class,
I
never
really
thought
about
the
power
of
symbolism
and
word
choice.
However,
after
reading
The
Scarlet
Letter
and
One
Flew
Over
the
Cuckoos
Nest
I
began
to
truly
embrace
books
for
their
details.
NThe
author
chooses
every
single
word
for
a
reason,O
Mrs.
Lanza
would
tell
us,
and
I
never
forgot
this.
I
began
to
reflect
on
titles
and
opening
sentences
for
hours.
For
example,
I
came
to
greatly
admire
how
instead
of
just
telling
us
that
Roger
Chillingworth
is
an
evil
character,
Hawthorne
selects
an
ominous
name
and
emphasizes
his
eerie
physical
attributes.
It
is
then
the
readerOs
responsibility
to
notice
these
clever
descriptions
and
interpret
them
accordingly.
It
may
have
seemed
obvious
to
others,
but
for
me,
it
was
new
and
exciting.
I
had
never
noticed
little
details
such
as
the
description
of
the
weather
or
the
colors
that
the
characters
are
wearing;
I
never
took
the
time
to
think
about
their
importance.
In
that
class
I
learned
that
if
you
want
to
truly
embrace
and
experience
an
authorOs
writing,
you
must
give
the
details
the
attention
they
deserve.
I
used
this
lesson
to
improve
my
own
writing.
Before,
I
had
never
really
put
much
effort
into
word
choice
or
selecting
powerful
quotes
because
I
was
focused
on
getting
the
essay
done.
After
multiple
in-class
essays
and
language
lessons,
my
writing
had
completely
transformed.
My
diction
went
from
simplistic
and
youthful,
to
colorful
and
collegiate.
Once
I
found
the
beauty
in
writing,
it
made
me
really
care
about
my
essays.
From
that
day
on,
I
never
passed
in
a
piece
of
writing
I
didnOt
find
powerful
or
that
I
wasnOt
proud
of.
Throughout
my
middle
school
and
high
school
years
I
went
from
avoiding
writing,
to
tolerating
writing,
to
loving
and
appreciating
writing.
In
the
last
two
years
of
high
school,
my
English
teachers
assigned
us
to
writing
projects
in
an
array
of
different
genres.
For
example,
after
reading
The
Catcher
in
the
Rye,
Mrs.
Lanza
had
us
write
a
letter
to
HoldenOs
parents
from
the
point
of
view
of
his
psychologist.
We
had
to
research
physiological
terms
and
diagnoses,
while
focusing
on
carefully
describing
Holden.
It
was
difficult
because
I
had
never
really
done
anything
like
that
before,
but
the
majority
of
my
classmates
and
I
enjoyed
it.
My
senior
year
we
were
also
asked
to
write
a
movie
review.
After
completing
The
Importance
of
Being
Earnest
by
Oscar
Wilde,
I
was
instructed
to
watch
the
movie
and
harshly
critique
it.
This
was
a
whole
new
field
of
writing
for
me.
I
had
to
be
witty,
critical
and
professional.
The
process
was
entirely
different
than
that
of
a
literary
analysis,
but
it
was
fun
and
helped
to
further
expand
my
writing
repertoire.
Other
genres
that
I
tapped
into
included
persuasive
essays
and
poetry,
but
one
of
my
favorite
papers
that
I
have
ever
written
was
a
Npathway
paper.O
My
teacher
described
this
as
an
essay
that
carefully
studies
the
power
of
a
specific
word
or
motif
in
a
novel.
I
chose
to
study
the
meaning
and
importance
of
the
word
NdustO
in
George
OrwellOs
1984.
This
essay
forced
me
to
think
more
analytically
and
critically
than
I
ever
had
before.
I
had
to
come
up
with
interesting
inferences
and
patiently
search
the
entire
book
for
this
four-letter
wordOs
appearance.
It
was
one
of
the
most
difficult
paperOs
I
had
ever
written,
and
by
far
the
most
rewarding.
My
teacher
commented
on
the
powerful
verbs
I
selected
and
the
interesting
topic
sentences.
I
got
a
one
hundred
on
the
essay
from
a
really
tough
teacher
and
was
completely
thrilled.
It
was
a
fun
and
rewarding
essay
to
write
because
I
felt
like
I
had
come
up
with
profound
ideas
that
were
completely
my
own.
I
had
my
parents
read
my
essay
before
I
handed
it
in,
and
I
will
never
forget
their
reaction.
When
I
was
in
middle
school,
my
Dad
would
always
take
out
a
pen
and
completely
rearrange
and
improve
everything
and
I
always
found
it
quite
frustrating.
After
reading
this
essay,
however,
he
put
the
paper
down,
looked
at
me
and
simply
said,
Nwow.O
He
and
my
mother
continued
on
to
tell
me
how
much
my
writing
has
transformed
throughout
the
years
and
how
wonderful
of
a
writer
I
have
become.
His
reaction
delighted
me
and
reassured
me
that
I
am
a
talented
writer.
Around
the
end
of
my
junior
year,
I
started
to
write
in
a
journal.
Writing
had
become
quite
an
addiction
for
me
and
I
figured
that
so
much
would
be
going
on
in
my
last
year
of
high
school
that
I
wanted
to
take
it
all
in
and
remember
it.
I
bought
a
small
simple
journal
at
Barnes
and
Noble
and
started
writing.
This
informal
means
of
expression
really
allowed
me
to
unleash
my
artistic
and
creative
side.
The
majority
of
school
assignments
are
structured
and
have
specific
guidelines
but
when
I
chose
to
write
in
my
journal,
I
could
write
with
complete
freedom.
I
originally
described
what
kind
of
day
I
had
had
or
different
issues
going
on
in
my
life.
Then,
I
decided
to
start
writing
down
powerful
quotes
that
I
found
in
books
or
online.
Every
day,
I
started
writing
down
different
quotes.
Everyone
from
Gandhi
to
John
Lennon
made
an
appearance
in
my
journal.
I
was
hypnotized
by
brilliant
words
and
clever
quotes.
By
seeking
out
great
quotations,
not
only
did
I
start
loving
writing,
but
I
also
fell
in
love
with
words.
I
admired
the
power
of
a
great
quote
and
began
to
realize
how
meaningful
sentences
and
phrases
can
be.
I
kept
up
with
my
formal
schoolwork,
of
course,
which
involved
writing
a
definition
paper
on
the
word
NdreamO
and
constructing
legal
briefs
for
my
criminal
law
class.
I
had
never
truly
realized
how
many
different
forms
writing
has,
but
my
school
did
an
excellent
job
exposing
me
to
them.
To
start
my
definition
essay,
I
sat
down
in
front
of
my
computer.
For
about
fifteen
minutes
I
sat
and
thought
about
hundreds
of
unique
and
fanciful
words,
words
that
were
interesting
open
to
interpretation.
The
one
I
selected
was
dream.
I
wrote
a
three-page
paper
on
the
many
interpretations
of
the
word
dream.
Unlike
many
of
my
peers,
I
did
not
find
this
essay
challenging.
It
was
whimsical
and
fun,
unlike
a
research
paper.
The
genre
that
captured
my
attention
the
most,
however,
was
the
writing
I
experienced
in
my
criminal
and
civil
law
classes.
It
was
in
these
classes
that
I
found
my
passion
for
the
law.
I
loved
the
logic
and
reasoning
when
dealing
with
the
cases
and
was
enamored
by
the
legal
style
of
writing.
After
concluding
these
two
courses,
I
was
determined
to
study
law
in
college
and
ultimately
go
to
law
school.
After
my
four
years
of
high
school,
I
felt
prepared
for
writing
in
college.
My
senior
year
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Bucholc,
was
quite
challenging
and
repeatedly
stressed
the
importance
of
completing
every
assignment
and
dealing
with
her
tough
grading
in
order
to
be
prepared
for
college.
We
read
challenging
books,
plays,
and
poetry
and
were
given
equally
challenging
assignments
upon
completing
them.
This
teacher,
despite
being
extremely
tough
and
critical,
ended
up
being
one
of
my
favorites.
She
skillfully
molded
us
and
taught
us
all
she
could
about
the
wonderful
English
language
and
the
importance
of
literature.
We
learned
about
satire,
Shakespeare,
dystopias,
Chaucer,
topic
sentences,
flow,
and
the
importance
of
elegant
diction.
In
summation,
we
went
in
high
school
seniors,
and
came
out
college-bound
intellectuals.
Upon
arriving
at
Lafayette,
I
was
slightly
nervous
about
my
writing.
My
junior
and
senior
year
had
really
been
confidence
boosting,
but
I
thought
that
maybe
Mrs.
Lanza
and
Mrs.
Bucholc
would
be
the
only
ones
who
liked
my
writing.
I
worried
that
the
professors
here
wouldnOt
like
my
style
or
have
different
requirements
and
tastes.
These
worries
quickly
dissolved
after
my
first
five
papers.
Much
to
my
delight,
my
professors
werenOt
too
hard
on
my
essays
and
commented
on
my
analytical
thinking.
Seeing
that
NAO
on
my
first
ever
college
paper
was
extremely
rewarding.
After
all
those
frustrating
years
of
dealing
with
being
a
weak
writer
and
not
receiving
the
instruction
I
needed,
I
was
finally
able
to
create
polished
pieces
of
writing.
I
cannot
accept
credit
for
the
level
my
writing
has
reached
today,
however.
Those
two
English
teachers
in
high
school
taught
me
everything
they
could
about
English
and
writing,
but
more
than
that,
they
taught
me
how
to
love
English
and
writing.
