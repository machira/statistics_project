My
Writing
History
-
by
My
very
first
attempts
at
writing
were
nearly
sixteen
years
ago.
I
had
not
yet
entered
kindergarten,
but
I
became
interested
in
reading
and
writing
because
of
my
older
brother,
who
was
learning
how
to
do
these
things
in
elementary
school.
I
had
always
looked
up
to
my
brother
and
tried
to
imitate
him
in
many
ways.
However,
now
I
was
faced
with
an
interesting
dilemma
because
I
could
not
merely
imitate
his
actions,
but
rather
I
had
to
learn
how
to
do
what
he
was
doing.
Hence,
I
went
to
my
mother
and
told
her
that
I
wanted
to
learn
how
to
read
and
write.
Rather
than
tell
me
to
wait
until
I
started
school
to
learn
these
skills,
my
mother
began
to
teach
me
them
on
her
own.
I
can
recall
sitting
on
her
lap
for
hours
trying
to
make
sense
of
the
words
in
my
books,
which
I
had
previously
ignored,
contenting
myself
with
the
pictures
above
them.
Several
days
passed,
and
my
mother's
lap
must
surely
have
been
growing
numb,
but
the
results
were
worth
the
time
and
effort.
In
a
matter
of
a
week
I
had
learned
how
to
read
basic
books.
Shortly
thereafter
I
began
to
tackle
the
task
of
writing.
I
started
by
copying
the
alphabet
in
capital
letters
over
and
over
again.
Luckily
the
paper
I
was
writing
on
was
the
paper
my
brother
had
brought
home
from
school,
which
meant
that
it
had
several
different
types
of
lines
on
it,
which
told
me
exactly
how
high
to
write
each
letter,
and
also
where
the
middle
of
each
letter
was
supposed
to
be.
As
helpful
as
the
paper
was
trying
to
be,
I
still
remember
becoming
very
frustrated,
because
I
kept
ripping
it
with
my
pencil.
Finally,
after
what
seemed
like
millions
of
hours
of
practice,
I
could
hold
the
pencil
at
the
proper
angle
and
produce
beautiful
capital
letters
without
tearing
the
paper.
Next
came
lower-case
letters,
which
did
not
seem
to
be
much
trouble
at
all,
now
that
I
had
mastered
the
art
of
not
ripping
the
paper.
In
retrospect,
it
seems
hard
to
believe
that
I
did
not
begin
writing
stories
before
elementary
school,
due
to
the
fact
that
I
knew
how
to
both
construct
letters
and
read
words.
I
guess
that
I
was
content
with
these
skills,
and
did
not
feel
the
need
to
take
them
any
further
at
that
stage
in
my
life.
Hence,
my
first
"stories"
did
not
come
until
the
following
year
when
I
began
kindergarten.
My
very
first
stories
were
not
creative
ones;
rather,
they
were
merely
recounting
events
that
had
happened
in
my
life,
e.g.
how
I
spent
my
summer.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
in
first
grade
I
was
required
to
keep
a
weekly
journal,
which
was
graded
on
both
content
and
length,
which
encouraged
me
to
use
embellishment
in
my
writing.
I
distinctly
remember
the
fact
that
constructing
the
journal
out
of
colored
paper
and
decorations
was
far
more
fun
than
writing
in
it,
which
became
somewhat
of
a
chore
on
Friday
afternoons.
My
first
creative
writing
assignment
that
I
can
recall
came
in
elementary
school
in
a
program
called
Challenge
&
Enrichment.
I
was
supposed
to
create
a
story
that
had
multiple
endings,
based
on
selections
the
reader
made
at
several
different
points
in
the
text.
Before
writing
the
story
itself,
I
was
required
to
make
a
flowchart
depicting
the
different
outcomes
and
how
each
one
was
to
be
obtained.
I
chose
an
adventure
story
where
a
couple
of
friends
were
searching
for
treasure.
I
liked
the
idea
that
the
reader
could
control
the
outcome
of
the
story,
based
upon
choices
that
he/she
made.
The
part
that
I
did
not
care
for
was
mapping
out
the
story
ahead
of
time.
I
would
have
rather
liked
to
see
each
different
path
unfold
along
the
way.
I
am
not
quite
sure
why
I
did
not
like
to
plan
writing
ahead
of
time,
perhaps
because
it
eliminates
some
spontaneity
and
creativeness
if
one
feels
that
they
must
follow
their
"outline",
which
was
something
that
often
had
to
be
handed
in
before
the
completed
assignment,
and
grades
were
based
partly
on
how
well
the
outline
was
followed.
The
assignments
I
liked
the
most
were
the
ones
in
which
I
was
free
to
choose
the
topic,
such
as
in
a
research
report.
Conversely,
the
assignment
I
liked
the
least
were
those
in
which
I
was
forced
to
write
in
a
particular
manner.
For
instance,
in
fourth
grade,
my
class
learned
about
several
different
types
of
poems,
and
after
learning
about
a
new
kind
of
poem,
we
were
told
to
write
a
poem
in
that
fashion.
Hence,
if
we
had
just
learned
about
haiku,
I
had
to
write
a
haiku,
selecting
and
counting
the
words
very
carefully.
I
believed
then,
and
I
still
believe
today,
that
poetry
is
the
essence
of
creativity,
and
that
not
everyone
can
write
poetry,
which
is
why
forcing
someone
to
do
so
is
"cruel
and
unusual
punishment".
Poetry
can
be
interpreted
in
many
different
ways,
which
made
it
hard
for
me
to
understand
how
teachers
could
assign
a
grade
to
a
poem
based
on
how
"good"
it
was,
when
the
level
of
goodness
was
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder,
namely
the
teacher.
I
never
wrote
poems
on
my
own,
perhaps
due
to
the
fact
that
I
did
not
have
an
enjoyable
experience
with
them
from
the
very
beginning.
Junior
high
school
brought
out
the
best
and
the
worst
in
my
writing,
but
not
in
that
order.
In
junior
high
school
I
was
in
an
accelerated
English
program,
as
I
had
been
in
elementary
school.
My
seventh
grade
teacher
tended
to
make
assignments
boring
and
routine,
and
also
wasted
the
beginning
of
every
class
checking
for
book
covers,
handing
out
detentions
to
those
students
who
did
not
have
them.
Consequently
I
was
unmotivated
that
year,
and
my
writing
was
more
going
through
the
motions
than
it
was
a
learning
experience.
Although,
throughout
my
year
of
little
to
no
motivation,
I
was
still
able
to
receive
good
grades,
because
I
knew
what
my
teacher
wanted
out
of
my
writing
and
I
produced
accordingly,
receiving
such
comments
as
"nice
job"
on
my
papers.
Eighth
grade
was
an
entirely
different
experience.
I
knew
from
day
one
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
fun
class,
not
only
from
what
I
had
heard
about
this
English
teacher,
but
also
from
my
first
impressions
of
her.
She
was
the
most
lenient
teacher
I
had
ever
encountered
up
to
this
point,
stressing
that
the
important
thing
is
that
an
assignment
be
completed
to
the
best
of
our
ability,
rather
than
handing
in
something
lesser
just
to
adhere
to
a
deadline.
She
encouraged
us
to
work
in
groups
as
well,
which
was
also
a
new
idea
to
me
as
far
as
writing
was
concerned.
By
allowing
us
to
work
in
groups
several
times,
we
received
constructive
criticism
from
our
peers
as
well
as
the
teacher
which
was
beneficial
in
improving
our
writing
style.
The
focus
of
the
year
was
to
create
interesting
papers,
not
worrying
as
much
about
grammar
as
about
content;
because,
as
my
teacher
often
said,
"An
android
can
be
trained
to
correct
grammar,
but
an
android
can
not
be
made
to
be
interesting".
One
project
that
I
liked
especially
that
year
was
working
together
on
writing
a
play.
I
had
never
been
interested
in
plays
before,
and
they
do
not
hold
a
dear
place
in
my
heart
today,
but
for
some
reason
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
that
project.
My
group
chose
to
have
each
member
create
two
characters.
The
characters
were
then
thrown
together
in
a
story
which
we
all
created,
and
somehow
a
play
emerged,
which
we
later
read
aloud
to
the
rest
of
the
class.
Despite
the
fact
that
I
received
A's
in
English
for
both
seventh
and
eighth
grade,
I
learned
and
tried
much
harder
in
eighth
grade,
noting
that
my
teacher
noticed
the
effort.
I
remember
the
comment
"some
of
the
most
distinguished
prose
I
have
ever
seen
for
someone
your
age"
-
a
long
way
away
from
the
comment
"nice
job".
My
ninth
grade
English
teacher
was
clearly
the
most
influential
in
my
later
writings.
She
is
the
one
who
taught
me
how
to
write
an
essay
-
making
sure
that
the
introduction
tells
what
the
paper
is
about,
that
the
body
does
what
the
introduction
said
it
would,
and
that
the
conclusion
ties
everything
together.
Ninth
grade
writing
was
laborious,
and
essay
after
essay
seemed
to
be
assigned,
but
in
the
long
run,
I
was
a
more
effective
writer.
Ninth
grade
also
marked
the
first
year
that
I
had
to
write
formal
speeches.
One
assignment
even
allowed
us
to
write
stand-up
comedy
and
perform
it
as
well,
if
we
so
chose.
In
both
tenth
and
twelfth
grades,
I
had
the
same
teacher
for
math.
He
greatly
influenced
my
life
in
that
I
received
several
math
awards
both
locally
and
nationally,
and
I
also
ended
up
attending
the
same
college
as
he.
However,
Mr.
Clark's
knowledge
was
not
only
limited
to
offering
advice
on
how
to
prepare
for
math
meets,
but
he
also
made
me
write
papers
and
lab
reports
for
math.
I
was
allowed
to
select
a
topic
of
my
choice,
and
had
to
understand
the
math
related
to
the
topic,
as
well
as
present
the
information
in
a
manner
which
anyone
could
understand,
even
if
their
math
background
was
limited.
This
task
proved
to
be
difficult,
because
he
also
imposed
length
restrictions,
which
meant
that
I
could
not
merely
oversimplify
every
difficult
concept.
After
several
drafts,
I
successfully
turned
in
a
coherent,
easy
to
understand
paper
on
Boolean
Algebra.
Mr.
Clark
taught
me
the
importance
of
clarification,
because
it
did
not
matter
if
I
understood
something
-
what
really
mattered
was
that
I
understood
something
and
was
able
to
explain
it
in
such
a
way
that
others
could
understand
it
as
well.
Advanced
Placement
English
also
was
an
interesting
class.
It
was
the
first
time
that
I
was
required
to
write
movie
reviews
for
a
class.
The
class
taught
me
much
about
writing
just
by
reading
what
other
people
thought
about
my
own
work,
i.e.
more
peer
evaluation.
This
class
also
taught
me
to
rely
on
what
I
know
and
to
consider
myself
already
prepared
for
anything.
A
perfect
example
of
this
was
the
week
before
the
Advanced
Placement
Exam.
Rather
than
studying
past
exams
and
trying
to
predict
what
would
be
on
the
coming
exam,
my
teacher
told
us
that
we
had
worked
hard
enough
all
year,
and
that
now
it
was
time
to
relax,
so
we
watched
The
Blues
Brothers
all
week
long.
Incidentally,
everyone
in
the
class,
except
for
one
student,
received
a
4
or
a
5
on
the
exam.
By
the
time
I
reached
college
I
felt
that
I
was
adequately
prepared
for
the
writing
requirements.
I
already
knew
that
I
was
exempt
from
English
110,
hence
the
only
writing
course
I
took
during
my
freshman
year
was
my
FYS,
although
I
did
write
papers
for
several
other
classes.
I
had
come
into
college
expecting
that
the
assignments
would
be
extremely
lengthy
and
arduous.
Much
to
my
delight,
the
assignments
were
not
overly
long,
and
the
deadlines
were
extremely
reasonable.
I
felt
that
my
high
school
had
prepared
me
extremely
well
for
college,
and
I
tackled
my
first
paper
with
the
hopes
of
obtaining
an
A.
After
waiting
for
the
professor
and
my
WA
to
read
and
hand
back
my
first
two
drafts,
my
final
draft
finally
came
back
with
an
A\A-,
which
pleased
me
greatly.
Last
year,
my
writing
became
more
technical,
due
to
the
fact
that
I
had
to
produce
laboratory
reports
for
psychology.
I
had
to
learn
what
information
was
essential
in
duplicating
an
experiment,
and
also
how
to
write
in
American
Psychological
Association
(APA)
format.
I
quickly
learned,
with
the
aid
of
my
professor,
which
material
to
include
in
a
report
and
which
to
leave
out.
Consequently,
my
laboratory
writing
skills
improved
immensely,
and
I
am
now
confident
in
all
of
my
reports,
regardless
of
which
class
it
is
for.
Incidentally,
the
writing
I
did
in
Linear
Algebra
as
well
as
in
my
VAST
course
involved
presenting
math
in
a
way
that
can
be
readily
understood
by
"non-math
types
,
a
skill
that
I
had
learned
in
high
school.
All
in
all,
I
have
gained
confidence
in
myself
as
a
writer
and
look
forward
to
the
challenges
of
the
next
two
years,
as
well
as
later
in
life.
