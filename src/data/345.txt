Literary
Narrative
Fall
2002
This
year's
great
find
during
our
annual
house
cleaning
occurred
as
I
was
rummaging
through
the
bottom
drawer
of
the
desk
I
had
used
while
growing
up.
The
discovery
was
of
an
8
V"
x
7"
tan
and
brown
composition
book.
On
the
front
it
read,
Name:
My
fifth
grade
dairy
I
immediately
placed
myself
back
in
my
fifth
grade
classroom,
sitting
next
to
Chad
and
Daniella
on
the
very
first
day
of
school.
I
could
hear
Mrs.
Guenzel
explaining
to
each
of
my
classmates
and
me
how
every
morning
she
would
write
a
question
on
the
blackboard
to
which
we
would
respond
in
these
little
brown
books
as
a
way
to
practice
our
cursive
handwriting.
9/6/91
I
have
brown
hair
and
brown
eyes.
My
hair
is
pretty
short.
I
am
4
foot
8
inches.
Sometimes
I
wear
jewlry,
but
I
don't
have
my
ears
peirced.
I
have
braces
on
my
top
and
bottom
teath.
I
do
not
wear
glasses.
When
I
grow
older
I
would
like
to
be
a
lawyer
because
I
like
stiking
up
for
people
who
I
think
are
wright.
I
want
to
go
to
the
college
named
Prinston.
I
flipped
through
the
journal
seeing
the
progression
as
my
handwriting
changed
from
straight
up
to
slanted.
I
also
observed
my
spelling
and
punctuation
improvements
over
the
course
of
the
year.
Although
surely
I
made
prior
efforts,
this
journal
is
my
first
memory
of
a
writing
assignment
that
allowed
me
to
begin
to
develop
my
own
writing
style.
Knowing
the
journal
entries
were
not
for
the
sake
of
perfecting
the
writing
process,
I
became
more
comfortable
in
conveying
my
thoughts.
Thus,
a
style
of
writing
unique
to
me
began
to
emerge
as
I
began
writing
with
greater
ease.
The
next
transition
I
can
recall
in
my
literary
development
came
during
the
start
of
eighth
grade.
Ms.
Fox
set
forth
a
series
of
writing
assignments
intending
to
teach
us
how
to
analyze
texts.
I
began
to
recognize
the
individual
parts
that
comprise
a
paper
as
I
learned
about
introductory
and
conclusion
paragraphs
and
what
should
be
included
in
the
body
of
a
formal
paper.
Most
importantly
though,
this
was
the
first
time
I
heard
the
term
"thesis"
(which
is
still
following
me
today).
I
can
remember
the
great
emphasis
that
was
placed
on
this
concept
of
developing
a
thesis,
which
is
evident
by
the
underlining
of
it
in
my
first
paper
on
To
Kill
A
Mockingbird.
Prejudice
is
a
part
of
life
that
everyone
experiences
at
some
time
or
another.
Children
often
do
not
know
what
prejudice
is,
but
over
time,
they
begin
to
learn
more
and
more
about
it.
In
the
town
of
Maycomb,
racism
and
classism
are
two
prejudicial
influences
that
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
community.
From
Tom
Robinson's
trial
the
town
begins
to
understand
how
prejudices
can
affect
people's
judgment,
resulting
in
biased
and
unfair
behavior.
As
someone
who
is
terrified
of
insects,
my
assignment
to
sit
in
the
woods,
recording
my
thoughts
and
observations
in
a
journal,
was
a
dreaded
one.
I
sat
and
listened
to
Mr.
Allen
as
he
described
to
my
fellow
11th
grade
classmates
and
me
what
he
expected
us
to
do.
He
described
how
we
would
each
have
a
"spot"
in
the
woods
that
we
would
study
from
the
ending
summer
until
late
fall.
My
classmates,
pleased
with
the
thought
of
spending
the
45
minute
class
period
outside,
quickly
gathered
their
belongings
to
head
outside.
I
reluctantly
gathered
my
notebook
and
pen
to
join
them.
Once
outside,
I
timidly
approached
the
opening
in
the
trees
where
a
path
led
down
to
a
stream.
As
everyone
else
dispersed
to
claim
their
"spot,"
I
stayed
at
the
edge
of
the
woods,
feeling
itchy
and
sweaty.
Mr.
Allen's
enthusiasm
for
nature
was
inconceivable
to
me
and
this
journal
assignment
was
sure
to
be
my
downfall.
Despite
my
initial
unwillingness
to
immerse
myself
in
nature
and
the
assignment,
I
found
myself
wandering
a
bit
further
into
the
woods
each
day.
Unlike
the
rest
of
the
students,
who
had
a
specific
spot
to
which
they
returned
everyday,
I
wandered.
My
early
journal
entries
were
superficial
descriptions
of
the
trees
and
flowers
that
surrounded
me.
But,
as
the
term
progressed,
my
creativity
surfaced.

In
college,
my
journal
entries
transitioned
from
reflective,
handwritten
pieces
to
informed,
word-processed
ones.
During
my
semester
in
London,
I
was
required
to
keep
a
daily
journal
of
my
experiences
working
in
a
law
firm
to
compile
into
a
final
report.
During
the
day,
I
would
scratch
notes
to
myself
on
a
legal
pad
as
I
observed
trials,
interoffice
presentations,
or
meetings
with
judges.
Each
night,
I
would
transform
my
notes
into
coherent
journal
entries
on
the
computer
where
I
had
a
folder
on
the
C:/
drive.

Dec.
2001
In
working
on
the
Porton
Down
case,
I'm
learning
a
great
deal
about
how
much
effort
goes
into
preparing
for
a
single
trial.
Additionally,
I
have
been
able
to
speak
with
Alan
on
numerous
occasions
to
discuss
his
strategies
for
approaching
the
case.
For
example,
today
I
learned
that
in
order
to
be
successful
in
suing
for
damages
in
this
particular
case,
one
of
the
most
crucial
things
to
accomplish
is
creating
shock
value
for
the
judge.
The
negative
consequences
the
veterans
suffered
from
the
experiments
(specifically
to
their
health)
must
be
portrayed
to
the
judge
such
that
he
fully
understands
the
severity
of
the
injustice
that
was
done
at
Porton
Down.
The
skills
I
learned
from
keeping
a
journal
in
London
have
been
useful
for
the
writing
I
do
for
the
mock
trial
team.
The
way
in
which
I
prepare
my
closing
argument
greatly
depends
on
my
ability
to
reactively
record
notes
during
the
trial.
Although
I
prepare
an
argument
prior
to
the
start
of
the
competition,
being
able
to
make
last
minute
changes
based
on
the
information
that
emerges
during
the
trial
is
crucial
to
being
a
success.
One
key
difference
between
journal
entries
and
preparing
an
oral
argument,
however,
is
the
consideration
for
the
audience.
Being
straightforward
is
essential
in
a
closing
argument
so
the
jury
or
judge
can
clearly
follow
the
points
being
made.
Thus,
rather
than
writing
an
essay
that
I
would
simply
read
or
recite
word
for
word,
an
outline
form
is
often
a
more
effective
way
of
writing
a
closing
argument.
Throughout
the
course
of
this
trial,
we
have
shown
you
that
Roger
Holman,
as
the
owner
of
the
Everest
Experience
had
a
duty
to
exercise
due
care
for
the
safety
of
P
J.
Gilbertson.

The
challenges
I
have
met
as
a
writer
continue
even
today.
Just
this
past
semester,
writing
for
the
newspaper
introduced
me
to
a
completely
different
genre
of
writing
than
anything
I
had
ever
known.
My
entire
education
had
been
based
on
expressing
my
thoughts
and
ideas
mainly
through
the
use
of
descriptive
language
-
adjectives
and
adverbs.
Yet
for
the
newspaper,
the
use
of
either
of
such
embellishment
was
almost
fully
off
limits.
While
simultaneously
taking
the
course,
"Writing
for
Publication"
how
to
write
for
The
Lafayette
became
clearer
to
me.
An
emphasis
on
being
concise
rather
than
verbose
seemed
to
be
key
in
creating
a
good
story.
Reaching
the
main
point
or
climax
of
a
story
in
the
opening
paragraph
was
at
first
foreign
to
me,
yet
I
can
now
appreciate
how
important
this
aspect
of
writing
for
publication
is
in
drawing
a
reader
into
the
story.

Each
year
hordes
of
Lafayette
Students
flee
their
cozy
campus
on
the
hill
to
take
part
in
abroad
study
programs
that
seem
more
an
escape
than
an
academic
experience.
While
the
administration
boasts,
"Lafayette
ranks
11th
among
the
nation'
s
50
top-ranked
liberal
arts
colleges
in
the
number
of
students
that
study
abroad,"
they
do
not
reveal
the
reasons
why
students
are
choosing
to
venture
away
from
Lafayette.
The
ability
to
tell
the
reader
what
the
article
is
about
without
giving
away
the
entire
point
of
it,
leaving
them
intrigued
enough
to
actually
read
on,
is
a
great
challenge
in
writing
for
publication.
As
a
final
reflection
on
the
evaluation
of
my
literary
process,
I
must
underscore
the
impact
that
my
teachers
and
professors
have
had
on
my
ability
as
a
writer.
Mrs.
Guenzel's
blackboard
queries
each
morning,
Ms.
Fox's
incessant
reminders
about
creating
a
thesis,
the
coaxing
Mr.
Allen
gave
me
about
understanding
nature
(a
topic
I
clearly
was
not
interested
in
writing
about),
and
the
encouragement
I
have
received
at
Lafayette
to
explore
alternative
genres
of
writing
have
all
contributed
to
shaping
me
into
the
writer
I
am
today.
Seeing
the
transitions
I
have
already
made
as
a
writer,
I
have
no
doubt
that
the
writing
process
still
continues
for
me
today.
Now,
as
I
begin
working
as
a
WA
I
hope
to
continue
to
enhance
my
own
ability
to
write
through
my
reading
of
others'
literary
pieces.
