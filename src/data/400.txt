Before
I
could
write,
I
could
speak.
Before
I
could
speak,
I
could
imagine.
My
mother
ran
a
theatre
for
18
years,
before
she
decided
to
pursue
a
masterOs
degree
in
drama
therapy
at
NYU.
She
has
one
more
year
to
go
.
.
.
thesis
mode
now.
The
goal
of
my
motherOs
theatre
has
always
been
the
importance
of
process,
not
product.
At
the
time
I
didnOt
realize
how
that
mentality,
process
over
product,
would
become
part
of
my
approach
to
writing.
Students
in
the
theatre
would
take
classes
such
as
mime,
theatre
games,
story
movement,
or
improvisation
for
a
number
of
years
before
being
asked
to
audition
for
the
theatre
company.
The
company
would
create
two
to
three
shows
a
year,
each
show
starting
from
scratch.
Piece
by
piece,
an
exercise,
a
story
or
a
quick
snap
shot
of
an
image
suddenly
would
morph
into
an
idea,
and
the
actors
would
have
a
product.
This
was
my
childhood.
I
would
play
with
fabrics
slated
to
be
part
of
a
battle
between
two
gods,
eat
breadcrumbs
backstage
intended
as
a
prop,
and
stand
in
the
glow
of
a
rose-colored
gel
used
for
lighting.
I
was
given
permission
to
create
stories.
Around
the
age
of
five,
I
started
to
take
classes
and
perform
in
my
momOs
theatre.
I
was
no
longer
an
internal
little
bug.
I
was
asked
to
articulate
my
ideas,
to
vocally
engage
people
in
what
I
had
to
say-
to
speak.
Looking
back,
the
expectations
were
quite
high.
Not
only
was
I
the
directorOs
daughter,
but
I
was
a
five-year-old
trying
to
communicate
with
teenagers.
I
was
introduced
to
my
first
writing
style-
playwriting.
Although
our
plays
were
ensemble-based,
they
were
a
great
way
to
develop
my
own
voice
and
simultaneously
maintain
a
degree
of
humility.
I
learned
to
receive
criticism,
to
have
my
voice
challenged
and
to
accept
its
alterations.
The
shows
were
always
a
culmination
of
what
everyone
had
to
say,
not
just
one
person.
We
all
learned
to
be
unselfish.
Writing
was
a
sand
castle
throughout
elementary
school.
I
would
build
towers
and
moats
and
some
of
it
would
get
washed
away
as
the
summer
allowing
me
to
forget
everything.
My
third
grade
teacher
Mr.
Kenny,
who
resembled
Jack
Nicholson
in
NThe
Shining,O
asked
us
to
keep
a
journal.
Each
night
we
had
to
read
a
book
and
summarize
it.
I
found
myself
not
only
summarizing
it,
but
questioning
how
it
made
me
feel,
whether
I
liked
the
story
and
comparing
it
to
others.
Although
it
was
only
a
two-month
assignment,
I
kept
the
journal
the
entire
school
year.
A
classmate
snickered
when
he
saw
that
I
had
continued
to
read
stories
and
write
about
them.
I
was
not
ashamed.
I
explained
that
it
was
fun
and
did
not
feel
like
work.
One
day
Mr.
Kenny
asked
us
to
describe
our
favorite
food.
I
described
macaroni
and
cheese-Nthe
velvety
bed
of
orange
cheese
upon
which
lay
the
noodles.O
Mr.
Kenny
read
the
paragraph
to
the
class.
I
grinned
from
ear
to
ear.
It
was
the
first
time
I
received
absolute
validation
for
my
writing.
And,
I
loved
grammar.
I
relished
the
concept
of
a
comma
or
an
apostrophe
and
thinking
of
examples
on
the
spot.
I
was
a
master
speller,
but
due
to
being
nervous
I
forgot
the
NrO
in
Arkansas
in
the
second
round
of
a
fifth
grade
spelling
bee.
I
began
to
keep
a
composition
book
of
poems,
simple
verses
that
made
me
feel
special
when
I
found
words
that
rhymed.
I
was
drawn
to
poetry
because
it
asked
me
to
use
my
voice
in
a
different
way.
It
challenged
the
way
I
was
used
to
speaking
about
things.
In
sixth
grade,
I
won
a
contest,
and
I
read
my
poem
at
our
awards
ceremony.
It
was
wonderful
to
win,
nerve
wracking
to
present.
In
seventh
grade
I
was
the
grand
prize
winner
of
the
Karen
Ann
Quinlan
contest
in
which
the
theme
was
NThank
you.O
It
was
a
gooey,
sentimental
poem
about
a
daughter
thanking
her
mother
that
had
diedEI
thinkEI
canOt
really
remember.
But
the
winning
kept
my
eyes
open
to
the
use
of
writing
as
an
outlet,
as
something
that
could
grow
with
me.
The
summer
before
eighth
grade
I
attended
OThe
Young
PlaywrightsO
high
school
playwriting
program
in
its
inaugural
summer.
I
was
thrown
into
a
sea
of
high
school
students
at
the
age
of
13.
The
first
day
of
the
program,
we
imagined
ourselves
as
inanimate
objects
and
wrote
monologues.
I
was
a
dish
waiting
to
be
cleaned.
I
hated
the
product
of
the
summer.
We
had
to
create
a
seven
minute
play
and
we
were
only
allowed
certain
objects
like
a
rubber
chicken
and
an
empty
pint
of
Haagen
Daaz
ice
cream.
I
loved
the
process.
It
was
the
mini
exercises,
little
dips
into
creative
pockets
of
my
imagination
that
would
have
otherwise
remained
stationary.
Throughout
my
playwriting
classes
in
my
theatre
training,
those
were
what
I
loved
most.
My
junior
high
school
years
focused
on
personal
journals
and
poetry.
It
was
another
way,
besides
the
theatre,
for
me
to
materialize
my
imagination.
I
loved
the
tactile
sensation
of
penning
a
thought
down,
of
creating
something
permanent.
Through
the
journals,
I
could
track
a
journey
and
review
it
in
later
years.
I
stopped
keeping
a
journal
after
eighth
grade
because
I
found
that
articulating
my
ideas
vocally
was
more
fulfilling.
I
didnOt
want
to
talk
to
myself.
I
wanted
to
talk
to
people.
I
wanted
to
develop
my
external
voice.
My
family
has
given
me
the
foundation
to
harness
creativity
and
allow
it
to
be
a
catalyst
in
all
that
I
do.
My
dad
writes.
It
was
not
his
writing
that
prompted
me
to
delve
into
it
as
a
hobby
or
a
pursuit,
rather,
he
encouraged
me
to
find
joy
in
it,
as
with
everything.
I
have
never
been
afraid
to
show
him
my
writing
in
order
to
seek
his
advice,
just
as
I
never
hesitate
with
teachers.
In
high
school
I
would
show
him
drafts,
but
these
days
I
usually
share
the
final
copy
with
him.
My
mom
is
a
good
thesaurus.
In
eighth
grade
came
the
best
decision
I
ever
made.
My
town
is
heavily
over-
populated
and
that
year,
my
eighth-grade
class
was
put
into
the
high
school.
My
parents
got
a
glimpse
of
what
education
would
be
like
for
the
next
four
years.
They
were
not
pleased.
Although
I
hated
it
at
the
time,
we
decided
to
pursue
private
school.
With
all
my
heart
I
know
that
had
I
not
made
that
change,
I
would
be
an
entirely
different
person.
Intellectual
curiosity,
pride
in
academics
and
education
and
the
vision
to
see
where
that
love
can
lead
you
--to
name
a
few
benefits
--
are
what
my
new
high
school,
Newark
Academy,
did
for
me.
It
was,
like
the
theatre
and
my
home,
another
safe
place
to
go
through
a
personal
and
intellectual
process.
And
I
took
my
time.
I
savored
my
relationships
with
teachers,
novels
we
read,
the
person
I
was
becoming
and
making
roots
in
my
academic
institution.
It
was
difficult
at
times
because
I
was
surrounded
by
renaissance
types,
both
an
inspiration
and
a
curse.
People
had
permission
to
try
everythingEand
I
did.
My
love
of
analytical
writing
began
at
Newark.
The
bits
and
pieces
took
four
years
to
come
together.
High
school
writing
was
a
long
road
trip:
I
took
detours,
like
the
NI-donOt-
believe-I-can-do-thisO
exit
or
the
Ntake-time-to-be-creativeO
U-turn.
High
school
also
sparked
my
love
of
the
process
of
writing,
and
with
my
theatre
roots,
process
was
always
praised.
Freshman
year,
I
took
a
wonderful
literature
class
with
novels
specifically
aimed
at
those
coming-of-age
years
such
as
This
BoyOs
Life
and
Catcher
in
the
Rye.
I
returned
to
the
realization
that
if
I
was
going
to
write
it,
I
had
to
speak
it.
I
loved
that
the
other
students
challenged
my
voice.
My
teacher
was
inspirational
and
brand
new.
I
was
the
first
student
of
his
teaching
career
to
whom
he
ever
gave
an
A.
American
Literature
came
sophomore
year.
I
found
myself
unchallenged
by
my
teacher.
I
sought
criticism,
not
simply
an
A.
I
didnOt
feel
myself
improving.
I
believe
that
pre
senior
year,
I
was
just
enjoying
the
ride
of
finding
my
own
voice
through
which
I
could
articulate
my
ideas.
I
began
to
appreciate
the
dialogue
that
I
would
engage
in
with
other
students
and
my
teachers.
In
all
my
years
of
high
school,
we
would
work
through
the
internal
narrative
to
draw
it
out
its
specific
voice.
Junior
year
was
a
writing
slump.
I
took
my
first
A.P
course
and
the
caliber
of
writing
was
much
higher
than
I
was
used
to.
I
couldnOt
find
my
voice.
I
didnOt
grasp
the
Nfacts,O
therefore
I
had
nothing
say.
I
was
a
Bad
WriterE.until
May
when
I
wrote
a
term
paper
on
Angela
Davis,
the
70Os
African-American
female
communist
icon.
I
was
enthralled
in
the
research,
as
if
I
were
brushing
away
the
dirt
on
the
drawings
of
LascauxOs
caves.
I
received
an
A,
which
wasnOt
nearly
as
validating
as
the
approval
from
my
teacher.
Junior
year
threw
a
number
of
different
writing
styles
at
me.
I
nearly
drowned,
then
began
to
tread
water
and,
by
the
end,
was
swimming
again.
I
experienced
a
different
kind
of
writing
in
my
Theory
of
Knowledge
class.
The
difficulty
in
these
papers
was
organization
and
confidence
in
my
thoughts.
The
papers
required
a
personal
voice,
yet
it
was
easy
to
fall
into
one
repetitive
style.
Through
I.B
Art,
I
returned
to
personal
writing
in
which
I
had
to
focus
on
myself
through
my
sketchbook.
This
was
a
two-year
journal
of
the
process,
research
and
thoughts
of
my
art.
I
also
wrote
my
first
newspaper
article
for
our
school
paper.
Now
I
had
to
be
concise,
yet
engaging.
British
Literature
was
a
challenge
due
in
part
to
the
teacher,
in
which
I
received
little
constructive
criticism.
I
remember
telling
one
of
my
teachers
andbest
friends
that
I
felt
I
had
completely
regressed
and
had
had
little
growth
as
a
writer
since
freshman
year.
Little
did
I
know,
I
would
be
saved
senior
year
and
see
that
I
still
had
some
writer
in
me.
Junior
year
shook
my
comfortable
writing
cubicle
because
I
was
no
longer
answering
questions,
but
asking
them.
Senior
year
I
would
write
papers
with
joy.
I
gained
an
independence
from
my
classmates,
as
writing
became
something
fluid
in
my
mind
as
opposed
to
staccato
mental
notes.
I.B.
Philosophy
forced
me
to
ask
questions
and
answer
them
and
answer
them
again
and
again.
Additionally,
as
the
arts
editor
of
our
school
newspaper,
I
experienced
the
grunt
work
of
journalism,
and
by
that
I
mean
grammar,
corrections
and
editing.
I
also
developed
a
love
of
strengthening
my
peersO
papers,
of
finding
the
heart
of
the
writerOs
voice
in
the
article
and
deepening
it.
I
began
to
read
my
peersO
papers
for
class
and
experience
a
writerOs
voice
other
than
my
own.
I
liked
the
dialogue
in
my
head
--
the
classmateOs
voice,
then
mine
as
I
would
read
their
prose.
This
year
became
a
remarkable
culmination
of
what
I
have
absorbed
over
the
years.
If
I
were
a
sponge,
this
year
I
was
rung
out.
I
revisited
the
importance
of
the
process
over
product
mentality
that
was
pounded
into
me
when
I
was
younger.
I
made
the
most
growth
in
the
way
that
I
approach
writing,
mainly
by
refining
my
process
of
outlining,
revising
and
freely
thinking.
I
did
not
come
into
college
with
any
specific
expectations
about
writing,
just
the
hope
that
I
would
find
a
way
to
become
better.
I
had
a
very
rewarding
freshman
year
as
a
writer,
particularly
in
the
spring.
I
received
praise
for
many
genres
of
writing
across
a
spectrum
of
classes,
such
as
sociology,
art
history,
and
college
writing.
I
received
an
honorary
mention
in
the
Jean
Corrie
Poetry
Contest,
and
had
a
letter
to
the
editor
published
in
The
New
York
Times.
Coming
to
Lafayette,
I
felt
that
Newark
Academy
gave
me
a
great
foundation
as
a
writer.
I
looked,
and
look
forward
to
building
upon
that.
What
they
donOt
tell
you
in
high
school
is
the
freedom
you
are
given
in
college-level
writing.
Students
have
to
adjust
the
blanket
outline
they
get
in
high
school.
At
this
point
in
my
life,
I
am
surrounded
with
each
style
of
writing
I
have
only
touched
upon
over
the
years.
I
write
poetry
when
I
have
something
to
say
that
simple
every
day
language
canOt
do
justice
to.
I
have
retraced
my
steps
back
to
journal
writing
and
am
harnessing
the
wanderings
of
my
mind
throughout
the
day.
Analytical
writing
has
taken
on
new
forms
as
I
learn
to
grasp
the
facts
so
that
they
become
second
nature
in
the
process.
I
desire
to
challenge
my
stylistic
voice
as
a
writer,
to
build
a
different
framework
for
getting
my
ideas
across.
I
fear
that
because
I
jump
around
in
many
types
of
writing,
my
voice
tends
to
be
muddled.
Writing
can
be
a
roller
coaster.
The
entire
process
is
that
fear,
yet
excitement
of
slowly
having
a
metal
car
creep
thousands
of
feet
above
the
ground.
And
you
know
itOs
safe,
but
your
hands
still
shake
as
you
grip
the
bar
or
break
your
friendOs
fingers.
Writing
is
floating
on
your
back
in
the
ocean.
The
give
and
take
between
you
and
the
wave
as
it
carries
you
from
shore,
and
then
you
do
the
work
to
get
back.
The
treasures
just
below
the
surface
can
only
be
seen
when
the
sun
shines
just
right
upon
the
water.
It
is
a
peaceful
calm,
yet
chaos
can
ring
in
your
ears
when
they
get
clogged
with
the
sea.
Writing
is
a
mud
bath
as
you
sit
with
your
thoughts
and
they
stiffen
around
you,
clumping
together
in
a
finale
of
cohesion.
