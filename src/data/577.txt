My
Writing
History
I
suppose
my
writing
history
started
out
as
any
normal
childOs,
in
grammar
school.
I
am
a
little
unsure
as
to
how
and
when
I
started
writing,
but
there
are
some
vague
memories
as
far
back
as
kindergarten.
The
writer
I
am
today
was
basically
born
in
high
school,
specifically
the
high
school
I
attended
for
my
sophomore
through
senior
years.
Obviously,
I
once
again
matured
as
a
writer
upon
arrival
in
college,
where
I
was
subsequently
forced
to
churn
out
lengthy,
analytical
compositions.
I
know
that
until
I
reached
my
sophomore
year
of
high
school
writing
was
a
dreaded
word
for
me
to
hear.
In
grammar
school
and
my
first
year
of
high
school
writing
was
associated
with
torture
in
my
mind.
It
was
not
until
I
reached
my
second
high
school
that
I
found
the
ability
to
enjoy
and
even
take
pride
in
my
writing.
My
earliest
recollection
of
writing
goes
back
to
when
I
was
in
kindergarten.
During
that
year
I
was
formally
introduced
to
both
reading
and
writing.
I
had
a
textbook,
of
sorts,
devoted
to
my
learning
how
to
write
the
letters
of
the
alphabet.
Pencils
were
the
tools
of
the
trade,
and
having
the
ability
to
write
even
the
simplest
of
words
brought
me
some
sense
of
accomplishment.
Things
carried
on
a
rather
steady
pace
of
development
until
second
grade,
where
my
breakthrough
was
learning
how
to
write
in
cursive.
However,
the
most
important
early
year
for
my
writing
was
third
grade,
the
year
I
developed
my
loathing
of
writing.
My
teacher
would
occasionally
have
us
do
short
written
assignments.
One
assignment
was
for
us
to
write
a
short
dialogue
between
ourselves
and
an
animal
of
our
choice.
I
dreaded
that
assignment.
I
have
never
been
a
creative
writer,
so
I
became
distraught
over
the
piece
and
wrote
the
bare
minimum.
This
problem
followed
me
through
most
of
my
years
in
elementary
school.
In
forth
grade
we
had
to
write
a
minimum
of
one
page,
hand
written
for
our
seasonal
essays.
I
have
always
lived
a
fairly
sedentary
life
and
my
family
is
fairly
small,
thus
I
was
given
no
exciting
anecdotes
to
include
in
the
page
I
was
to
write
about,
Nwhat
I
will
do
for
Thanksgiving,O
or
Nwhat
I
will
do
for
winter
break.O
I
tried
to
hide
my
dull
life
with
worse
than
normal
penmanship,
ultimately
leading
to
more
problems
when
I
was
forced
to
read
my
piece
in
front
of
the
whole
class.
Negative
feedback
from
my
teacher
and
the
blank
stares
of
my
classmates
ensured
that
writing
was
a
curse
for
me.
My
troubles
greatly
grew
once
I
reached
the
sixth,
seventh,
and
eighth
grades,
where
I
was
forced
to
take
on
a
new
level
of
challenge
for
my
writing:
poetry.
I
absolutely
hated
my
English
courses
during
these
years.
Boring
as
they
were,
I
would
have
always
preferred
to
read
the
grammar
text
book
or
whatever
vapid
stories
were
contained
in
our
readers
than
be
forced
to
fit
in
the
confines
of
one
sort
of
poetry
or
another.
My
troubles
also
increased
during
these
years
because
of
my
lack
of
ability
to
spell.
The
grades
on
my
spelling
tests
were
always
horrid
and
assignments
written
in
class
were
usually
covered
with
red
ink.
Thankfully,
I
was
allowed
to
use
a
computer
for
homework
assignments.
Microsoft
WordOs
spell
check
became
my
greatest
ally,
although
it
has
been
known
to
lead
me
astray
from
time
to
time.
To
make
matters
worse,
my
eighth
grade
English
teacher
felt
we
were
not
devoting
enough
class
time
to
English,
so
once
a
week
we
had
to
have
an
extra
writing
class
during
our
free
period.
Generally,
we
were
given
a
prompt
of
some
sort
and
told
to
write.
Our
class
took
place
in
the
computer
lab
and
I
remember
being
so
dismayed
that
one
day
I
bolded
certain
letters
in
my
paragraph
to
write,
NI
hate
this
stupid
assignment.O
Needless
to
say,
it
did
not
go
over
well
with
my
teacher.
The
issue
of
writing
did
not
get
any
better
in
my
first
year
of
high
school.
I
spent
my
whole
grammar
school
career
in
Catholic
school,
not
because
my
family
is
that
devout,
but
because
my
mother
has
a
fear
of
public
institutions.
After
being
placed
on
the
waiting
list
of
the
local
private
school,
I
had
no
other
option
but
to
go
to
the
public
school
for
my
first
year
of
high
school.
In
school,
I
always
did
well
in
history
and
foreign
language.
So,
when
I
went
into
the
public
school
it
made
sense
for
me
to
take
the
honors
history
class.
There
was
only
one
catch:
for
the
freshman
year
the
history
and
English
classes
were
joined
together.
The
idea
was
to
learn
about
an
era
in
history
and
learn
more
about
it
by
studying
its
literature.
Thus,
I
was
placed
into
not
only
an
honors
history
class,
but
also
an
honors
English
class.
My
fear
of
writing
went
from
bad
to
worse.
My
teacher
was
a
cranky
woman
facing
her
last
year
before
retirement.
She
had
no
patience
and
did
not
appreciate
my
writing
style.
In
addition
to
various
projects
and
essays
based
on
the
literature,
she
would
make
use
write
page
and
a
half
essays
in
class
about
once
a
month.
Generally,
when
I
wrote
something
I
was
pleased
with
it
was
returned
with
a
bad
grade.
I
never
got
much
feedback
on
my
papers,
either.
For
the
most
part,
there
was
an
arbitrary
letter
grade
placed
on
the
last
page
of
the
assignment.
After
a
yearOs
worth
of
mediocre
grades
with
no
feedback
I
was
beginning
to
feel
that
I
was
inept
at
writing.
But,
things
changed
when
I
switched
schools.
I
protested,
but
no
matter
what
my
mother
was
not
going
to
budge.
She
insisted
that
I
had
to
go
to
the
same
high
school
as
my
brother.
For
one
reason
or
another
the
public
school
was
not
good
enough;
rather,
the
private
school
was
magically
better,
partially
because
the
teachers
and
students
both
had
a
strict
dress
code.
My
personal
feelings
about
the
atmosphere
of
the
school
aside,
I
did
learn
a
lot
in
class,
especially
in
English.
Touted
as
a
college
preparatory
school,
I
must
concede
that
I
was
prepared
for
college
with
all
the
writing
I
did
in
various
courses
at
the
school.
Somehow,
somewhere
along
the
line
in
grammar
school
I
never
fully
learned
how
to
write
an
essay.
The
word
essay
did
not
really
mean
anything
to
me.
Previously,
all
that
was
required
from
me
was
a
paragraph
or
two
of
my
ideas
or
concrete
examples,
say
from
history,
and
I
was
done.
The
words
introduction
and
conclusion
made
sense
in
my
mind,
but
I
did
not
know
how
to
apply
them
to
my
writing.
It
was
easy
enough
for
me
to
write
a
paragraph
or
two
in
response
to
a
question
about
a
story
or
poem,
but
I
did
not
know
how
to
write
at
length
or
how
to
organize
my
thoughts.
I
suppose
I
owe
the
majority
of
my
writing
skills
to
my
sophomore
English
teacher,
a
laid
back
ex-hippie
who
tried
to
get
the
most
out
of
his
students.
The
first
book
we
read
was
Beowulf
and
shortly
after
completing
the
story
we
were
given
a
series
of
essay
topics
to
write
about.
Unlike
my
previous
English
classes,
however,
the
teacher
made
the
task
manageable
by
breaking
the
assignment
into
parts.
The
first
step
was
for
him
to
give
us
a
special
outline
and
an
introduction
to
the
five-paragraph
essay.
It
all
seemed
so
simple
after
that.
English
had
always
been
a
grey
area
in
my
mind,
it
was
all
subjective,
but
this
English
teacher
had
brought
something
concrete
to
this
world.
Having
the
elusive
subject
of
English
anchored
with
instructions
made
sense
to
me.
Writing
an
essay
took
similar
steps
assembling
a
toy
or
piece
of
furniture.
Step
1:
Write
a
thesis.
Step
2:
Come
up
with
three
main
ideas
that
support
that
thesis.
Step
3:
Have
each
of
those
three
ideas
backed
up
by
three
details,
preferably
quotes,
taken
from
the
reading
itself.
Step
4:
Put
the
thesis
and
three
ideas
into
a
paragraph
and
make
it
your
introduction,
and
so
forth.
Additionally,
this
teacher
brought
in
another
useful
element,
peer
readers.
The
day
before
the
final
essay
was
due,
we
brought
three
copies
to
class
and
gave
them
to
three
people.
During
class
we
would
read
three
other
peopleOs
essays
and
fill
out
an
evaluation
sheet.
It
was
a
wonderful
experience.
I
no
longer
felt
like
a
complete
idiot
when
it
came
to
writing.
For
the
first
time
in
my
writing
career,
I
was
finally
getting
positive
feedback
from
both
my
peers
and
my
teacher.
Writing
was
no
longer
associated
with
torture
in
my
mind.
Also,
my
English
class
success
was
carrying
over
to
my
other
classes.
My
essays
in
French
class
were
more
coherent
and
the
arguments
in
my
history
essays
became
stronger
and
tighter.
Perhaps
the
biggest
shock
of
all
came
towards
the
end
of
the
year
when
my
English
teacher
recommended
me
for
advanced
placement
English.
In
one
year
I
had
gone
from
getting
bad
grades
on
my
writing
assignments
to
being
lauded
for
my
writing
talent.
My
junior
year
marked
another
first
in
my
writing
career.
Previously,
I
had
never
written
outside
of
the
classroom.
Writing
was
not
something
I
enjoyed;
rather,
it
was
merely
a
part
of
school.
But,
that
year
I
started
writing
for
the
school
newspaper
as
the
satire
writer.
Whenever
we
managed
to
get
an
issue
out,
it
was
always
accompanied
by
a
piece
of
mine
poking
fun
at
something
in
the
school
or
in
the
world
around.
The
shocking
part
was
that
I
fully
enjoyed
it.
In
the
past,
it
would
take
me
lengthy
amounts
of
time
to
write
anything.
Suddenly,
I
was
able
to
write
things
quickly
and
with
little
effort.
Given
a
topic
I
liked,
I
could
write
an
800
word
article
in
roughly
fifteen
minutes.
My
classmates
and
friends
would
read
the
articles
and
tell
me
they
enjoyed
them.
I
would
be
on
the
lunch
line
and
a
teacher
would
commend
me
for
my
satire
of
the
administration.
It
felt
good
to
be
praised
for
my
writing
after
all
my
years
of
feeling
humiliated
by
my
work.
Academically,
my
junior
year
did
not
differ
much
from
my
sophomore
year.
Once
again
I
found
myself
writing
the
five-paragraph
essay
and
succeeding.
I
used
it
in
my
English,
French,
and
history
classes.
The
only
change
to
my
system
came
at
the
end
of
the
year.
My
assignment
was
to
write
a
twelve
page
thesis
driven
research
paper
for
my
United
States
history
course.
Previously,
the
most
I
had
ever
written
on
any
assignment
was
seven
or
eight
pages.
Twelve
pages
seemed
like
the
unattainable.
However,
using
lesson
from
my
sophomore
English
class
I
calmly
outlined
what
I
wanted
to
say
and
found
supporting
evidence
for
my
thesis.
By
doing
so
I
was
able
to
write
all
twelve
pages,
although
the
experience
was
not
enjoyable.
My
senior
year
changed
my
writing
style
for
the
worse.
During
the
course
of
my
senior
year
I
dropped
the
idea
of
an
outline.
All
of
this
was
due
to
my
history
course,
Advanced
Placement
European
History.
The
culprit
was
preparation
for
the
written
portion
of
the
exam.
Every
other
week
I
had
to
hand
write
a
three
page
essay
for
homework.
Because
of
the
time
constraints
of
the
exam,
I
was
expected
to
write
a
miniature
version
of
the
five
paragraph
essay
in
thirty
minutes
or
less.
While
I
was
allowed
to
cheat
a
bit
on
the
time
at
home,
I
was
forced
to
abide
by
the
strict
time
constraints
on
test
days.
Gone
was
the
idea
of
taking
time
to
plan
out
an
essay
and
become
completely
organized.
I
used
to
take
anywhere
from
half
an
hour
to
an
hour
to
plan
out
my
essays,
now
I
had
five
minutes
at
the
most.
My
process
once
again
turned
into
something
sloppy.
I
would
formulate
a
thesis
and
come
up
with
a
point
or
two
in
my
mind.
As
soon
as
I
got
that
far
I
would
start
to
write
my
introduction
in
hopes
of
the
rest
coming
to
me
by
the
end
of
it.
Currently,
I
do
not
start
with
an
outline;
rather,
after
thinking
about
the
assignment
for
some
time
I
start
to
type.
My
thinking
process
is
tied
into
that
of
my
history
class.
I
come
up
with
a
thesis
that
I
think
I
can
support
and
start
writing
an
introduction.
The
introduction
is
my
new
form
of
an
outline.
With
my
thesis
written
down,
I
know
what
I
ultimately
intend
to
say.
Writing
down
supporting
ideas
also
helps
to
reaffirm
what
I
want
to
further
express.
From
there,
I
proceed
to
write
a
very
rough
first
draft.
My
rough
draft
then
allows
me
to
see
what
I
need
to
improve.
Using
the
first
draft,
I
construct
a
minimal
outline
to
make
sure
that
I
cover
everything
I
intend
to
say.
I
suppose
it
is
a
very
backward
way
of
writing,
but
it
has
worked
out
very
well
for
me.
Although
rather
stressed
out,
this
approach
worked
perfectly
for
me
when
I
was
assigned
three,
ten
page
research
papers
during
the
second
semester
of
my
freshman
year
of
college.
From
start
to
finish
my
writing
style
has
changed
numerous
times,
but
I
have
finally
reached
a
style
that
works
for
me.
I
feel
happy
with
what
I
write
and
the
comments
I
receive
about
my
writing.
Currently,
I
am
an
academic
writer
and
I
see
no
reason
to
change
that.
I
would
not
say
that
I
enjoy
writing;
instead,
it
is
a
tool
that
I
use
for
my
education.
If
I
really
enjoyed
writing,
I
would
probably
continue
to
write
for
a
newspaper
or
would
do
so
in
my
free
time.
Being
slightly
lazy
and
happy
with
my
current
situation,
I
hope
not
to
change
my
style
or
purpose
of
writing
anytime
soon.
