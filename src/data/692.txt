Writing
Narrative
8/14/11
When
I
was
younger,
reading
and
writing
were
not
exactly
my
strongest
points.
In
the
third
grade,
I
left
my
friends
and
teachers
behind
to
start
fresh
at
a
new
school.
Needless
to
say,
this
was
not
my
idea.
Petrified
in
my
little
blond
pigtails
I
walked,
alone,
into
the
strange
classroom
that
faithful
September
day.
Being
a
fairly
shy
child
I
was
pleased
at
how
welcoming
the
teacher
seemed
and
for
my
new,
fearlessly
outgoing,
friend
Liz,
who
volunteered
to
help
me
out
that
day.
As
class
began,
I
pulled
my
pencils
and
notebooks
out
of
my
Scooby-Doo
backpack.
Looking
at
the
board
only
moments
later,
however,
I
realized
neither
would
be
necessary:
this
class
could
read
script.
I
had
no
idea
what
was
written
on
the
board.
When
I
returned
home
later
that
day
I
was
emotionally
exhausted.
I
loved
my
new
friends
but
I
was
too
timid
to
approach
the
teacher
about
how
far
behind
I
was
in
writing:
I
convinced
myself
I
wasnOt
as
smart
as
these
students.
Over
the
next
few
months,
my
mother
and
teacher
helped
me
to
catch
up.
My
reading
began
to
improve
little
by
little,
and
soon
enough
I
discovered
my
love
for
the
imaginative
Harry
Potter
series.
At
first
I
needed
to
read
the
J.K.
Rowling
books
slowly,
with
my
mother
constantly
correcting
my
shaky
diction.
As
frustrating
as
the
whole
ordeal
was,
I
became
utterly
glued
to
the
characters
story,
and
still
enjoy
reading
them
today.
Although
my
grades
began
to
improve,
I
was
never
quite
the
top
of
my
class.
I
struggled
in
nearly
every
subject,
and
my
teachers
merely
brushed
me
off
as
not
as
bright
as
some
of
the
other
students.
The
first
teacher
to
recognize
me
(crouched
and
quiet
in
the
back
of
the
classroom)
was
my
seventh
grade
language
arts
teacher,
Mrs.
Mucci.
I
hated
her
right
off
the
bat.
She
noticed
I
was
fading
into
the
background
and
began
to
call
me
out
in
class:
asking
me
to
answer
questions
I
didnOt
volunteer
answers
for,
coming
up
to
the
board,
and
so
on.
She
petrified
me,
but
as
the
year
progressed,
she
drove
me
to
better
myself.
It
was
as
though
a
small
fire
was
lit
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
and
it
burned
brighter
with
every
remark.
I
wanted
to
impress
her,
and
by
the
end
of
the
year,
I
did.
My
skills
in
reading
and
writing
improved
dramatically.
When
I
decided
to
apply
to
more
prestigious
Manhattan
High
Schools,
as
opposed
to
settling
for
the
usual
options
in
the
Bronx,
she
became
my
advocate.
Despite
my
guidance
councilorOs
discouraging
remarks,
I
began
my
freshman
year
at
Loyola
School,
on
83rd
and
Park
Avenue.
This
is
where,
for
the
first
time,
I
found
my
voice.
In
total,
Loyola
High
School
contains
two
hundred
students:
fifty
in
each
graduating
class.
The
class
sizes
ranged
from
fifteen
to
eight,
and
I
could
no
longer
disappear
into
the
back
of
the
room.
My
high
school
teachers
challenged
me
to
challenge
myself,
especially
in
various
forms
of
writing.
IOve
taken
AP
history
courses
that
taught
me
reading
comprehension
and
how
to
properly
structure
a
document
based
question.
My
required
labs
encouraged
accurate
documentation,
and
how
to
compose
a
clear,
concise
lab
report.
In
English
classes
I
wrote
research
papers,
persuasive
essays,
speeches,
letters,
poetry,
short
stories
and
once
I
even
wrote
seven
pages
in
iambic
pentameter.
Freshman
year
went
by
in
a
blur
of
new
faces,
longer
commutes,
and
academic
obstacles
to
overcome.
Sophomore
year
is
where
my
journey
as
a
writer
really
began.
One
of
the
toughest
grammar
critics
I
ever
met
was
my
theology
teacher
that
year,
Mr.
Paladino.
All
of
his
exams
were
essays
tests,
and
all
of
his
papers
made
you
think
and
consider
a
variety
of
opinions,
without
making
assumptions,
or
taking
sides.
It
wasnOt
his
assignments
that
made
him
stand
out,
however,
but
his
grading
method:
every
paper
and
exam
was
studied
twice:
first
for
content,
clarity,
and
ability
to
answer
the
question,
then
for
grammar.
He
would
take
off
a
quarter
of
a
point
for
every
spelling
mistake,
typo
and
punctuation
error,
and
half
a
point
for
passive
voice.
Mr.
Paladino
never
curved
his
grades,
and
on
multiple
occasions
sent
students
home
with
negative
marks
on
quizzes.
As
with
Mrs.
Mucci,
this
particular
teacher
made
me
hate
him,
and
then
want
to
impress
him.
Before
long
I
found
myself
looking
up
definitions
and
examples
of
all
the
grammar
mistakes
I
made
in
the
past,
even
practicing
picking
them
out
in
other
assignments
until
they
became
second
nature.
There
was
this
one
paper
that
IOll
never
forget:
I
spent
so
much
time
completely
focused
on
making
my
grammar
immaculate
that
I
completely
missed
the
point
of
one
of
the
questions.
I
was
beyond
aggravated,
but
didnOt
stop
moving.
It
made
me
focus
on
reading
each
question
with
care,
and
keeping
my
answers
as
clear
as
possible.
By
the
end
of
the
course,
my
final
paper
came
back
with
a
ninety-eight
percent
and
the
respect
of
a
great
teacher.
The
second
teacher
that
comes
to
mind
remains
my
favorite
of
all
time,
Mr.
Gregory.
Mr.
Gregory
was
my
English
teacher
sophomore
year,
and
later
my
Writing
Fiction
teacher
senior
year.
For
now,
however,
IOll
focus
on
what
I
learned
from
him
sophomore
year.
One
of
the
first
classes
that
sticks
out
in
my
mind
was
a
grammar
lesson
on
verbs,
gerunds
and
prepositional
phrases.
Mr.
Gregory,
being
an
unpredictably
eccentric
man,
walked
into
the
classroom,
sat
on
the
desk,
and
proclaimed
his
love
for
my
classmateOs
shoes.
He
then
asked
her
if
he
could
borrow
one.
The
rest
of
the
period
consisted
of
him
tossing
shoes
and
various
other
items
about
the
room,
successfully
relating
them
to
the
grammar
at
hand,
and
having
the
students
do
the
same.
He
never
feared
straying
to
other
grammatical
areas
when
a
worthy
comparison
arose.
I
swear
IOve
never
learned
more
in
a
single
class
then
I
did
that
day.
If
there
is
one
thing
that
Mr.
Gregory
gave
me
that
no
other
teacher
had,
it
was
confidence
in
my
own
writing,
particularly,
as
I
will
later
discuss,
in
my
senior
year.
I
like
to
look
at
my
writing
up
to
this
point
as
a
brand
new
car:
all
the
tools
for
success
were
now
available;
I
just
needed
to
start
them
up.
My
junior
year
was
an
entirely
different
story,
and
frankly
an
academic
road
bump.
Due
to
my
newfound
confidence,
improved
grades,
and
teachers
praises,
the
little
girl
who
couldnOt
read
the
board
in
third
grade
stumbled
her
way
into
honors
English.
Now
this
class
was
a
serious
rollercoaster.
Ms.
Smith,
my
teacher
for
this
course,
was
new
to
Loyola,
and
extremely
eager
to
prove
herself
to
the
administration.
Being
that
I
was
still
a
fairly
quite
student,
she
initially
walked
all
over
me.
When
I
did
speak
up,
we
often
did
not
agree,
and
in
my
papers,
she
criticized
my
then
free-spirited
writing
style.
When
it
came
to
literature,
she
firmly
followed
the
textbook
and
disapproved
when
I
offered
counter
explanations.
Looking
back
at
my
work
now,
I
see
that
a
good
majority
of
the
time,
I
was
wrong
in
my
views.
I
failed
to
fully
examine
the
texts
and
understand
why
she
taught
one
idea
over
another.
She
never
explained
any
of
that
to
me,
and
I
was
loosing
confidence.
Then
Ms.
Smith
assigned
Jane
AustinOs
novel,
Pride
and
Prejudice;
things
began
to
look
up.
I
fell
in
love
with
the
writing,
the
intricacy
of
the
characters
personalities
and
the
story
as
a
whole.
I
sat
up
late
into
the
night
reading
that
book;
I
simply
couldnOt
put
it
down.
In
the
next
few
classes
Ms.
Smith
assigned
a
closed
reading
of
a
chapter
to
each
student,
giving
me
chapter
eighteen.
I
knew
this
was
my
chance
to
prove
myself
to
her.
I
volunteered
to
go
first.
I
finished
Pride
and
Prejudice
before
the
allotted
date,
marking
up
the
pages
with
notes,
ideas,
and
inquiries.
Then,
I
did
some
research
on
various
takes
on
the
novel,
and
anything
I
could
find
in
regards
to
the
on
goings
of
chapter
eighteen.
I
stayed
up
until
two
in
the
morning
perfecting
my
closed
chapter
analysis,
with
no
introduction,
and
no
conclusion
(just
as
instructed),
I
wrote,
quoted,
and
in
some
instances
mimicked
the
language
for
affect.
When
I
read
my
perfectly
structured,
accurate
paper
in
front
of
the
class,
they
were
all
shocked.
I
am
enormously
proud
of
that
paper.
My
senior
year
was
the
perfect
balance:
I
took
AP
English
and
Writing
fiction
as
my
two
writing
based
classes.
Dr.
Meade,
my
AP
teacher,
was
strictly
a
by-the-book
type
of
teacher,
and
he
was
good
at
it.
His
discussion-based
class
was
rather
difficult,
full
of
complicated
pop
quizzes
and
weekly
papers.
Dr.
Meade
helped
my
jumble
of
connections
and
imaginative
ideas
flow
in
an
intellectually
sound
structure,
while
Mr.
Gregory
dared
me
to
break
that
structure,
and
make
writing
feel
like
art.
This
is
when
I
put
the
key
into
the
ignition
of
my
shy-new
car,
and
leaned
the
importance
of
road
signs.
Whenever
I
wrote
something
my
junior
year,
I
had
the
tendency
to
sound
unprofessional,
and
sometimes
story-like.
Senior
year,
I
fully
began
to
understand,
and
separate
different
forms
of
writing,
while
establishing
my
own
style.
I
owe
my
love
for
creative
writing
to
Mr.
Gregory.
Writing
Fiction
was
my
smallest
class:
eight
students
and
a
teacher
sitting
in
a
circle.
We
spoke
openly,
practiced
all
sorts
of
sporadic
writing
drills,
and
were
challenged
to
push
past
our
limits;
the
impossible
was
possible
in
this
class.
We
began
the
year
writing
short
stories,
and
later
moved
to
poetry,
where
I
found
my
niche.
Although
I
consider
myself
a
mediocre
poet,
the
freedom
to
say
what
I
wanted,
to
paint
it
with
words,
became
my
guilty
pleasure.
After
seeing
my
enthusiasm
for
the
class,
Mr.
Gregory
approached
me
about
co-editing
that
yearOs
Literary
Magazine.
This
Magazine
is
entirely
student
run,
and
open
to
all
submissions.
Having
been
published
in
the
magazine
before,
I
was
aware
of
the
workload
involved
with
editing,
and
decided
to
take
on
the
responsibility.
My
co-editor
and
I
were
in
charge
of
everything
from
the
magazineOs
theme,
creating
the
covers
and
page
layouts,
to
weeding
through,
organizing,
and
making
editorial
remarks
on
all
of
the
submissions.
Before
I
knew
it
my
work,
and
my
high
school
career
was
over:
I
was
the
freshman
again.
Coming
into
college
I
was
both
nervous
and
excited:
it
was
a
whole
new
world
of
academic
and
extra-curricular
possibilities.
Keeping
with
my
driving
analogy,
college
is
a
defensive
course
in
highway
driving:
IOm
learning
not
just
to
keep
both
eyes
on
the
road,
but
to
check
my
mirrors
and
handle
whatever
comes
my
way.
As
orientation
came
to
a
close,
and
classes
began
I
was
practically
shaking
with
anticipation:
would
I
be
able
to
compete
with
my
new
classmates?
What
would
my
professors
be
like?
I
was
petrified
of
not
being
able
to
hold
a
candle
to
my
classmates
in
writing,
but
lucky
for
me,
it
seems
that
my
high
school
education
did
a
fair
job
of
keeping
me
up
to
scratch.
Math
on
the
other
hand,
is
a
whole
other
story.
FYS
was
fantastic;
Stories
and
Possibilities
was
the
perfect
fit
for
me,
and
my
professor
and
classmates
were
incredibly
welcoming.
I
enjoyed
the
books
we
read,
and
the
papers
were
manageable.
I
was
particularly
excited
when
we
got
the
opportunity
to
write
a
historical
fiction
at
the
end
of
the
semester.
This
final
paper,
which
I
wrote
after
studying
the
diary
of
James
Boyde,
a
young
man
who
attended
Lafayette
in
its
early
years,
was
a
challenge
I
would
take
again
in
a
heartbeat.
Another
challenge
I
took
that
first
semester
was
jumping
straight
into
English
205.
This
class
was
a
wake
up
call.
Since
AP
credits
enabled
me
to
skip
English
110,
I
thought
why
not
take
this
requirement
and
see
how
I
do?
All
in
all
I
did
fairly
well
in
the
class
despite
my
bumpy
start.
I
was
unfamiliar
with
a
lot
of
the
terminology,
and
I
was
so
nervous
about
how
I
would
score
on
my
first
two
hundred
level
college
papers
that
I
spent
a
majority
of
my
homework
time
fussing
over
them.
To
be
completely
honest,
if
I
didnOt
have
my
WA
telling
me
to
calm
down,
and
helping
me
with
a
few
things,
I
think
my
stress
level
would
have
rocketed.
Altogether,
as
in
High
School,
freshman
year
blew
by
in
a
whirlwind
of
exciting
and
new
people
and
ideas.
Sophomore
year
went
fairly
fast
as
well,
come
to
think
of
it.
As
of
now,
my
courses
in
every
semester
seem
to
show
a
similar
pattern:
I
begin
nervous;
unaware
of
the
new
professor
IOm
facing,
and
end
in
confidence.
For
example,
in
my
VAST,
AIDS
a
Modern
Pandemic,
I
was
nervous
about
leaving
my
comfort
zone
in
such
a
science
based
writing
course,
but
ended
with
a
much
improved
writing
style
and
confidence
in
my
knowledge
of
a
new
topic.
I
donOt
want
to
discuss
too
many
specifics
about
Professors
and
particular
courses
IOve
taken
in
college,
because
this
journey
is
still
in
progress.
I
do
however
want
to
mention
that
IOve
furthered
my
capabilities
in
reading
and
writing
in
more
ways
then
I
thought
possible,
and
I
am
eager
to
learn
more.
The
WA
Program
has
been
a
huge
help
to
me
in
the
past,
and
I
hope
that
I
can
learn
to
be
an
asset
to
the
program.
