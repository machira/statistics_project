My
Story
In
middle
school,
my
sixth
grade
English
teacher
explained
that
stories
should
reflect
a
bell
curve
with
a
clear
beginning,
middle,
and
end.
A
problem
or
event
should
occur
in
the
beginning
which
alters
the
charactersO
lives
and
which
must
be
overcome
by
the
conclusion
so
that
the
characters
can
live
Nhappily
ever
after.O
Case
closed,
end
of
story.
As
I
reflect
on
my
encounters
with
writing,
however,
I
find
my
own
story
is
anything
but
that
perfect
bell
curve.
In
a
word,
my
experience
has
been
tumultuous,
characterized
by
times
when
writing
was
as
my
one
of
my
greatest
joys
and
an
outlet
for
my
creativity
to
times
when
it
served
as
a
leading
cause
of
stress
and
unhappiness.
Moreover,
as
I
reflect,
I
realize
that
this
roller
coaster
of
experiences
has
shaped
the
strong
and
confident
writer
I
have
become
but,
more
importantly,
has
shown
me
that
my
story
is
far
from
a
conclusion.
My
earliest
memory
of
writing
is
from
kindergarten
with
an
activity
called
NWriterOs
Workshop.O
Each
student
was
given
a
few
sheets
of
paper
and
asked
to
write
and
illustrate
a
story
about
an
event
in
his
or
her
life.
Most
of
the
stories
were
the
same,
NHow
I
Got
My
DogO
or
NHow
I
Got
My
CatO
accompanied
by
a
few
other,
more
creative
tales,
such
as
one
boyOs
riveting
account
of
NHow
I
Got
My
Hernia.O
For
me,
WriterOs
Workshop
fostered
an
early
love
of
writing
and
story-telling.
Whereas
my
reading
skills
were
slow
to
develop,
writing
came
naturally
and,
thus,
to
makeup
for
my
inability
to
read
book
independently,
I
created
my
own
stories.
Throughout
elementary
school,
I
aspired
to
be
a
childrenOs
author
and
began
using
WriterOs
Workshop
as
a
time
to
craft
my
own
adventures
books
such
as
one
tale
I
wrote
in
second
grade
about
a
boy
who
lived
in
the
woods
with
an
evil
witch
until
a
family
rescued
him
and
invited
him
to
live
in
their
cottage
in
the
village.
By
fourth
grade,
my
stories
became
more
complex
as
I
started
adding
chapters
to
my
works
and
tried
to
include
every
detail
I
could
imagine.
Creative
writing
opened
the
door
for
my
imagination.
I
was
enchanted
by
the
immense
liberty
writing
offered
D
the
opportunity
to
spill
out
my
ideas
onto
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
and
transport
my
reader
into
a
world
completely
of
my
own
invention.
I
looked
up
to
authors
like
C.S.
Lewis
and
J.K.
Rowling
whose
imaginations
had
taken
me
to
the
magical
land
of
Narnia
and
introduced
me
to
Wizarding
World
and
characters
like
Lord
Voldemort,
Albus
Dumbledore,
and
Dobby,
the
house
elf.
It
was
with
these
authors
in
mind
that
I
worked
throughout
fourth
grade
to
create
my
own
fantasyland
in
a
story
that,
when
the
school
year
was
over,
amounted
to
some
twenty
pages.
From
what
I
remember,
the
plotline
involved
a
group
of
children
who
journeyed
to
a
magical
land
deep
in
the
woods
on
a
quest
to
find
three
hidden
objects
and,
in
doing
so,
free
the
land
from
the
wrath
of
an
evil
sorcerer.
Along
the
way,
the
children
befriended
a
cheerful
dwarf
named
NBlueO
who
helped
them
overcome
obstacles.
Throughout
elementary
school
writing
was
unquestionably
my
favorite
subject
and
one
at
which
I
excelled
with
a
natural
talent.
E
Writing
in
middle
school
followed
with
the
same
relative
ease,
yet
less
excitement.
I
still
enjoyed
English
class,
however,
I
no
longer
had
the
same
desire
to
spill
my
thoughts
out
onto
a
page
and
invent
a
new
story.
What
had
once
served
as
one
of
my
greatest
joys,
an
outlet
for
my
imagination
and
a
source
of
pride
and
self-expression
for
my
elementary
school
ego,
became
more
of
a
chore.
Instead,
I
grew
much
more
interested
in
social
studies
and
history.
As
I
reflect
today,
I
wonder
whether
perhaps
my
new-found
enthusiasm
for
non-fiction
historical
narratives
replaced
not
only
my
excitement
for
creative
writing
and
fiction
but
also
my
need
for
them
as
a
source
of
entertainment.
Nevertheless,
my
decreased
interest
in
writing
was
the
first
turning
point
in
the
story
of
writing
history,
the
first
bump
in
my
roller
coaster.
E
I
entered
high
school
a
strong
and
confident
writer.
Although
writing
was
no
longer
my
favorite
subject,
I
had
still
managed
to
do
well
in
it
up
until
that
point.
Little
did
I
know,
however,
just
how
much
everything
would
change
as
I
marched
through
the
doors
of
Jeremiah
Hill's
ninth
grade
English
class,
boldly
choosing
a
seat
at
the
head
of
the
room.
In
short,
writing
that
year
was
a
nightmare.
Up
until
ninth
grade,
my
encounters
with
writing
consisted
of
primarily
creative
writing,
poetry,
book
reports,
and
countless
journal
entries.
The
introduction
of
the
analytical
essay
threw
me
off
guard
D
it
was
something
new
and
completely
foreign.
Whereas
my
previous
writing
assignments
all
offered
the
creative
liberty
to
respond
to
them
as
I
saw
most
fit,
the
analytical
essay,
by
contrast,
symbolized
the
exact
opposite;
an
end
to
my
freedom
as
a
writer.
Mr.
Hill
loved
making
rules:
all
essays
must
contain
an
introduction,
three
body
paragraphs,
and
a
conclusion;
avoid
the
Nto
beO
verb;
when
you
can,
always
write
in
the
present
tense;
and
never
use
contractions.
For
the
first
time,
writing
had
a
format.
Failure
to
comply
resulted
in
a
lower
grade
as
I
experienced
with
one
paper
when
I
did
not
include
topic
sentences
at
the
beginning
of
my
body
paragraphs
and
thus
received
a
C.
Even
more
overwhelming
for
me
than
the
technical
restrictions
were
the
subject
matter
restrictions
imposed
by
these
analytical
essays.
With
fiction
writing,
I
could
express
my
ideas
and
invent
my
characters
and
my
magical
lands.
With
analytical
writing,
I
now
had
to
explain
someone
elseOs
thoughts
and
choices.
The
whole
concept
baffled
me.
How
was
I
to
explain
PlatoOs
thoughts
on
human
existence
in
NThe
Allegory
of
the
CaveO
or
discuss
the
significance
of
the
sentence
NJesus
weptO
in
the
Gospel
of
John?
With
each
paper,
I
faced
tremendous
writerOs
block
and
as
a
result
of
that
an
enormous
amount
of
stress
and
anxiety.
I
will
never
forget
sobbing
at
my
desk
and
staring
at
a
blank
document
on
my
computer
screen
as
I
tried
to
craft
an
essay
exploring
the
underlying
meaning
behind
Baz
Lurhman's
use
of
water
in
his
film
adaptation
of
Romeo
and
Juliet.
My
ideas
would
not
translate
onto
the
page;
the
words
simply
would
not
come
to
me.E
I
felt
ashamed
in
myself.
Once
an
enthusiastic,
confident,
and
prolific
writer
whose
words
flowed
freely
onto
the
page,
I
struggled
to
fill
up
the
length
requirements
on
my
assignments.
At
a
time
when
I
wished
to
become
an
even
stronger
writer
and
move
forward
on
the
bell
curve,
I
felt
I
had
taken
a
major
step
back.
Sophomore
year
English
began
just
as
miserably
as
Freshman
year
had
ended.
Writing
continued
to
be
a
struggle
and
each
assignment
brought
increased
stress
and
loads
of
tears.
I
feared
I
would
never
understand
the
analytical
essay
and
was
convinced
my
days
as
a
writer
were
over.E
Realizing
I
needed
help,
I
met
reluctantly
with
my
teacher,
David
Weintraub.
Like
Mr.
Hill,
Mr.
Weintraub
had
high
standards
and
expected
nothing
less
than
perfection
from
his
students.
I
looked
up
to
him
as
a
brilliant
teacher
but,
at
the
same
time,
feared
disappointing
him.
As
I
walked
into
his
classroom
early
one
morning
and
timidly
handed
him
what
I
considered
a
terrible
draft
of
my
latest
paper,
his
response
surprised
me.
NSo
whatOs
the
problem?O
he
asked
after
skimming
the
pages.
What
do
you
mean
what
the
problem,
I
thought
to
myself.
Look
at
it,
this
paper
is
awful.
It
makes
no
sense.
I
donOt
even
know
what
IOm
trying
to
say.
IOm
ashamed
to
even
be
bringing
it
to
you.
NWell,
Mr.
Weintraub,O
I
began,
N
IOve
had
a
lot
of
trouble
with
this
paper.
I
feel
that
my
thesis
doesnOt
match
my
conclusion.
My
topic
sentences
are
not
clear.
I
donOt
know
if
I
should
use
the
present
or
past
tense
in
this
paragraph
and,
look
here,
I
used
the
Nto
beO
verb
three
times
on
one
page.O
After
reading
the
paper
again,
he
nodded
and
admitted
NWell,
I
see
what
you
mean
about
the
topic
sentences,
and
the
conclusion
could
use
a
little
fine-tuning,
but
overall,
Audrey,
this
is
a
good
paper.
Your
thesis
is
strong
and
your
comments
in
class
have
demonstrated
that
you
understood
the
book
and
have
a
solid
grasp
of
your
topic.O
After
discussing
the
strengths
of
paper
in
greater
detail
as
well
the
areas
in
which
I
could
improve,
I
bolted
out
of
the
classroom
and
headed
straight
to
the
library
where
I
plopped
down
at
a
computer
and
began
typing.
I
did
not
stop
to
think,
I
just
wrote.E
My
ideas
flowed
out
onto
the
page
just
as
they
had
in
WriterOs
Workshop
years
before.
By
the
time
the
bell
rang,
I
had
written
a
page
and
a
half,
my
most
productive
work
on
an
analytical
essay.
By
no
means
was
the
paper
perfect,
but,
for
the
first
time
in
all
of
high
school,
I
was
proud
of
what
I
had
written.
My
meetings
with
Mr.
Weintraub
continued
throughout
the
year.
In
the
days
before
a
paper
was
due,
I
brought
him
draft
after
draft
and
together
we
discussed
my
strengths
and
weaknesses,
both
in
grammatical
terms
and
in
my
overall
analysis.
Over
the
course
of
the
year,
Mr.
Weintraub
resolved
the
major
problem
I
faced
with
analytical
essays.
With
Mr.
Hill,
I
viewed
analytical
writing
as
a
restrictive
rather
than
liberating
experience.
I
became
so
concerned
with
abiding
by
Mr.
HillOs
rules,
making
sure
my
essays
followed
the
required
formats
and
my
responses
accuratey
answered
the
questions
posed,
I
lost
my
own
voice
as
a
writer.
Mr.
Weintraub
taught
me
I
was
mistaken.
Although
the
technical
rules
of
writing
are
important,
he
showed
me
that
analytical
writing
is
first
and
foremost
a
reflection
of
my
thoughts,
my
reactions
to
the
authorOs
work,
and
my
emotions.
I
realized
that,
just
like
creative
writing,
analytical
essays
are
a
mode
for
self-expression,
driven
by
my
opinions
rather
than
technical
rules
or
essay
prompts.
Mr.
Weintraub
restored
my
confidence
in
my
ideas
and,
more
importantly,
my
ability
to
express
myself,
a
confidence
that
fueled
my
success
in
elementary
school.
I
finished
sophomore
year
earning
straight
AOs
each
semester
in
English
from
a
teacher
who
admitted
he
rarely
gave
above
a
B
+.
After
Sophomore
year,
the
rest
of
my
high
school
experience
followed
with
much
less
stress
and
even
some
enjoyment.
At
the
recommendation
of
Mr.
Weintraub,
I
enrolled
in
Honors
English
Junior
year
and
took
AP
Journalism
Senior
Year.
By
the
time
I
entered
Lafayette,
I
had
conquered
my
fear
of
the
analytical
essay
and
was
confident
in
my
writing
abilities
once
again.
Nevertheless,
my
story
was
far
from
a
resolution.
Throughout
high
school,
my
experience
with
analytical
writing
focused
mainly
on
literature.
Since
starting
Lafayette,
I
have
learned
how
to
combine
the
writing
skills
I
learned
in
high
school
with
my
passion
for
history
and
government.
Today,
I
am
writing
about
issues
that
matter
most
to
me.
For
example,
I
expressed
my
opinions
on
the
Constitutionality
of
the
Individual
Mandate
in
a
paper
for
my
Introduction
to
U.S.
Government
Class.
In
a
sense,
I
feel
I
have
come
full
circle
in
my
writing
experience.
Writing
began
as
an
outlet
for
my
creativity
and
has
once
again
become
a
thrilling
vehicle
for
me
to
express
my
views
on
issues
that
matter
most
to
me.
At
the
same
time,
however,
I
realize
that
my
story
will
never
reach
a
conclusion
as
I
am
constantly
improving
and
learning
what
a
powerful
a
tool
writing
can
be.
I
look
forward
to
continuing
my
story
and
helping
those
of
my
peers
shape
their
stories
this
year
as
a
WA.
