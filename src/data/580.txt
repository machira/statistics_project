Falling
in
and
out
of
love
with
writing.
My
interest
in
writing
has
been
a
gradual
derivative
of
my
love
for
books,
word
games
and
the
ever-present
hunger
for
a
good
story.
To
say
the
least,
I
do
enjoy
reading
much
more
than
writing
and
I
am
certainly
better
at
the
former.
Throughout
my
career
as
a
student
writer,
I
have
had
moments
of
enthusiasm
and
despise
towards
writing.
My
developing
interest
in
writing
has
not
only
been
facilitated
by
my
other
hobbies
like
reading
but
also
by
the
teaching
environment
in
which
I
have
been
nurtured
as
a
writer.
However,
these
same
factors
have
at
some
point
destroyed
my
love
of
the
art.
I
recall
with
amusement
my
first
reading
experience
that
at
the
time,
made
writing
seems
ludicrous.
The
British
rreading
for
beginnerss
book
series
entitled
rPeter
and
Janes
were
my
worst
and
unfortunately
first
reading
exercise.
As
a
young
precocious
girl
with
siblings
who
were
ten
or
more
years
older,
these
books
were
a
complete
bore
that
in
my
eyes,
also
ridiculed
the
work
of
writers.
The
writing
did
not
in
any
way
challenge
my
thinking.
I
understood
that
they
were
written
to
aid
young
readers
but
the
writing
was
too
simple
to
be
of
interest
to
me.
If
I
had
been
asked
to
consider
writing
as
one
of
my
interests
at
the
time,
I
would
have
laughed
at
the
absurdity
of
the
idea.
At
the
age
of
eight,
my
elder
sister
having
established
that
I
was
capable
of
reading
rPeter
and
Jane"
from
cover
to
cover,
introduced
me
to
the
world
of
funner
reading.
I
remember
the
two
distinctly
different
Wakefield
sisters,
Jessica
and
Elizabeth
in
the
popular
Sweet
Valley
High
books.
In
these
books,
I
found
a
new
kind
of
writing
that
was
not
only
entertaining
but
one
that
also
challenged
my
early
vocabulary.
It
was
this
particular
book
series,
together
with
others
like
Nancy
Drew
and
Famous
Five
that
sparked
my
interest
in
reading
and
later
on,
writing.
As
the
years
passed
by,
and
I
continued
to
read
my
sisterus
books,
I
found
myself
picking
an
interest
in
more
rmatures
literature
especially
books
by
African
writers.
I
remember
marveling
at
the
ability
of
writers
like
Nguigi
wa
Thiong
to
beautifully
express
themselves
in
a
foreign
language.
One
day,
my
father,
quite
impressed
by
my
failing
effort
to
comprehend
the
first
page
of
Peter
Abrahams'
Mine
Boy
,
allowed
me
to
join
the
family
pass-time
game,
Scrabble.
To
me,
a
scrabble
player
was
like
a
writer
who
laid
down
his/her
random
thoughts
on
the
table.
As
my
interest
in
words
grew,
it
didnut
take
much
for
my
conception
about
writing
to
change.
Later,
in
primary
school,
when
the
time
came
for
me
to
practice
developing
and
writing
a
particular
trend
of
thought,
I
was
a
very
eager
student.
Even
though
I
had
written
a
few
compositions
in
primary
school,
it
was
in
my
English
literature
class
in
secondary
school,
that
I
tackled
my
first
real
writing
exercise.
At
the
time,
we
were
reading
Thomas
Hardyus
rTess
of
the
duUrbervilless
for
class.
I
remember,
with
vivid
amusement,
my
very
rcontroversials
essay
that
failed
to
conceal
my
sympathy
for
Alec
Stoke-d'Urberville,
Tessus
rapist.
It
instead
portrayed
my
anger
towards
Angel
Clare
her
estranged
husband
whose
departure,
I
believed,
was
the
start
of
Tessus
downfall.
My
teacher
was
quite
impressed
with
my
work
and
I
started
to
believe
that
like
reading,
writing
was
going
to
come
easy.
She
continued
to
demand
creative
analysis
of
texts,
themes-however
controversial
or
socially
inappropriate.
It
was
this
class
that
promoted
my
critical
thinking
skills
and
the
ability
to
reasonably
argue
on
paper.
Two
years
later,
seated
comfortably
in
the
front
row
of
the
English
Literature
class,
with
a
new
teacher,
I
experienced
my
first
writing
horror.
Reading
out
loud
from
my
English
composition,
Miss
rCow
Shits
(nicknamed
so
because
of
her
continual
usage
of
the
word
in
reference
to
our
compositions,
and
quite
emphatically,
I
must
add)
unkindly
criticized
my
work,
with
the
least
amount
of
euphemism
I
have
ever
known
man
to
possess.
rWorst
sentence
structure
ever!
Didnut
you
learn
tenses?
Wrong
word
use!
Poor
punctuation!
Poor
grammar,
poor
grammar,
poor
grammaris
she
went
on
and
on.
It
was
not
so
much
as
the
criticism
but
the
way
she
rudely
gave
it
that
made
me
mad.
As
I
saw
more
and
more
of
Miss
rCow
Shits
and
the
more
I
remained
a
victim
of
her
destructive
criticism,
I
begun
to
lose
my
interest
in
writing.
It
became
a
bother
like
digging
in
the
rshambas-it
was
something
you
had
to
painfully
do
if
you
wanted
good
farm
produce.
With
time,
in
an
effort
to
avoid
my
teacherus
abuses,
I
dedicated
more
hours
to
my
writing.
Thankfully,
by
the
end
of
the
year,
the
abuses
had
become
rare
and
the
change
in
my
writing
was
tremendous.
In
such
a
short
period
of
time,
I
had
had
two
good
teachers
who
had
promoted
and
destroyed
my
love
for
writing.
My
first
teacher,
for
two
consecutive
years
had
praised
and
appreciated
the
creativity
and
originality
of
my
thoughts
in
my
writing
pieces.
I
had
mistakenly
thought
that
her
praise
had
been
directed
towards
my
abilities
as
a
writer.
In
reality,
I
had
never
bothered
to
master
basic
writing
skills.
My
second
teacher
taught
me
to
write
well
but
for
all
I
learnt,
I
paid
with
my
desire
and
fondness
of
the
art.
In
addition,
my
first
teacher
had
facilitated
critical
thinking
and
argumentative
writing.
Miss
rCow
Shits
for
all
her
good
efforts,
had
continuously
discouraged
us
from
tackling
argumentative
essays.
She
believed
that
it
was
important
to
learn
to
write
first
before
attempting
to
argue
in
our
writing.
For
two
years,
we
had
practiced
writing/telling
personal
stories
in
proper,
well-constructed
sentences.
As
I
learnt
the
basic
writing
skills
in
relation
to
grammar,
tense
use,
flow
etc,
I
lost
touch
with
my
creative
side.
I
remember
my
last
attempt
at
creativity
during
my
last
year
of
high
school.
It
was
a
poem
I
had
entitled
rMurder
by
mes
in
which
I
tried
to
convey
a
relationship
that
I
had
allowed
to
prosper
but
which
as
a
result,
had
caused
me
a
lot
of
pain.
On
reading
the
poem,
one
of
my
best
friends
had
asked
what
it
meant
to
portray.
My
other
friend,
the
kind
one,
had
shrugged
her
shoulders
in
response.
This
was
the
first
and
last
time
that
anyone
other
than
my
teachers
or
peer
editors
has
read
my
work.
Even
my
mother,
an
English
teacher
herself,
had
occasionally
begged
to
do
so
but
in
fear
of
receiving
polite/
kind,
neutral
responses,
I
refused
to
yield
to
her
whims.
Much
as
I
hate
to
admit
it,
my
early
writing
experience
was
strongly
built
on
a
pile
of
praises.
I
believed
that
this
pile
had
started
to
crumble
with
the
meeting
of
my
second
English
Literature
teacher,
who
had
given
the
term
rcriticisms
a
negative
meaning.
I
feared
that
any
further
criticism
especially
from
my
parents
and
friends
would
completely
destroy
my
potential
to
write
well.
Despite
the
steady
improvement
in
my
writing,
I
remained
disgruntled
for
I
believed
my
work,
lacking
in
thought
or
analysis,
was
boring,
uncreative
and
monotonous.
At
the
end
of
my
O'
Level
career,
I
felt
no
different
from
the
Peter
and
Jane
writers
that
I
had
mocked
during
my
early
reading
years.
I
was
capable
of
writing
a
series
of
well
constructed
sentences
but
incapable
of
capturing
the
reader's
attention.
Even
though
I
passed
English
at
OuLevel
with
an
A,
pursuing
the
subject
at
Au
Level
was
out
of
the
question.
However,
two
years
down
the
road,
having
pursued
pure
science
courses
for
my
A'
Level
education,
I
terribly
missed
the
discussions
and
interactions
that
went
on
in
the
humanities
and
social
science
classes.
Science,
in
a
way,
was
too
factual
to
allow
for
a
meaningful
debate.
I
missed
writing
about
literature
or
social
issues.
It
was
this
yearning
for
intellectual
freedom,
critical
writing
and
discussions
that
pushed
me
to
pursue
my
college
degree
at
a
liberal
arts
engineering
school.
Upon
enrolling
at
Lafayette
College,
I
had
goals
of
improving
my
writing
skills
to
incorporate
originality,
perspectives
and
creativity.
I
had
hope
of
regaining
my
interest
in
writing
and
was
very
excited
about
the
idea.
However,
like
my
second
writing
teacher,
my
first
writing
exercise
was
like
a
big
blow
to
the
head.
In
my
First
Year
Seminar
entitled
rGreat
Breakthroughss,
I
was
introduced
to
Scientific,
research-paper
writing
and
the
new
word
plagiarism
.
Throughout
high
school,
I
had
continually
passed
on
other
writers'
work
as
my
own
and
so
trying
to
avoid
this
was
scary
and
awkward
for
me.
Even
though
I
loved
the
class
discussions,
laboratory
sessions
and
the
course
as
a
whole,
the
reading
material
and
writing
exercises
were
always
so
scientifically
factual
and
technical
for
my
liking.
However,
doing
research
for
different
papers,
led
me
to
investigate
and
browse
the
work
of
several
authors
who
wrote
for
science
or
history.
In
addition
to
learning
how
to
present
scientific
findings
in
a
written
document,
I
discovered
the
art
of
hooking
the
reader-even
with
a
technical
paper.
However,
I
still
hungered
for
more.
It
was
in
my
English
110,
College
writing
course
entitled
rThe
American
Dreams
that
I
finally
found
the
writing
experience
that
I
had
imagined
all
my
life.
As
the
title
suggests,
the
class
encouraged
and
facilitated
several
different
perspectives.
Similarly,
the
writing
exercises
were
open
to
new
ideas
or
a
different
course
of
argument.
This
course
recreated
the
atmosphere
of
my
first
English
Literature
class.
It
rekindled
my
excitement
for
reading.
I
began
to
feel
that
I
could
connect/
relate
to
a
topic
and
build
relationships
with
characters
in
a
story.
And
so
like
I
had
expected
as
I
packed
for
college,
my
fondness
for
writing
returned
with
all
the
rediscovered
adrenaline
for
reading.
Unlike
a
certain
previously
mentioned
English
teacher,
my
professorus
criticism
of
my
work
was
nothing
short
of
constructive.
She
made
helpful
suggestions
in
response
to
my
work
and
remembered
to
give
due
praise
where
deserved.
In
addition,
my
work
was
examined
by
fellow
students
during
the
peer
editing
sessions.
Not
only
did
my
classmates
bring
a
fresh
perspective
to
my
writing
style,
they
also
helped
my
writing
by
letting
me
peer
edit
their
work.
Reading
my
classmatesu
work
allowed
me
to
recognize
common
mistakes
that
I
sometimes
missed
in
my
own
work.
It
was
this
atmosphere
that
finally
allowed
me
to
grow
as
into
the
writer
I
wanted
to
be.
Much
as
my
process
of
writing
became
easier
and
lovable
as
I
progressed
through
this
writing
course,
I
started
to
feel
anxious
after
the
midterm.
I
was
beginning
to
experience
some
difficulty
while
attempting
some
writing
exercises.
It
could
have
been
because
of
the
increasing
school
workload
towards
the
end
of
the
semester
that
caused
me
to
dedicate
less
time
to
my
writing.
However,
I
also
realized
that
a
lot
of
this
difficulty
was
due
to
the
fact
that
I
found
the
texts
presented
during
the
second
half
of
the
course
hard
to
read.
Usually,
it
is
much
easier
to
write
about
something
that
one
enjoyed
reading
than
to
discuss
a
text
that
was
difficult
to
read,
or
one
that
did
not
please
the
reader.
Furthermore,
my
tendency
to
become
too
involved
with
a
text,
character
or
topic
at
times
prevented
me
from
being
objective
a
piece
of
writing.
For
example,
Art
Spiegelmanus
In
the
Shadow
of
No
Towers
about
the
9/11
saga
in
Manhattan
was
one
of
the
hard
books
I
had
to
read.
Spiegelman
took
a
topic
that
I
found
so
disturbing
and
poignant
and
told
in
it
in
a
way
that
I
felt
trivialized
its
importance.
There
is
no
doubt
that
In
the
Shadow
of
No
Towers
is
a
brilliant
book.
However,
Spiegelmanus
excessive
dedication
of
symbolism
and
metaphors
made
the
text
hard
for
me
to
follow.
In
addition,
his
application
of
comics
and
humor
to
such
a
distressing,
painful
topic
was
infuriating
and
prevented
me
from
appreciating
his
obvious
skill.
Therefore,
when
asked
to
examine
his
contribution
towards
the
revelation
of
the
horrors
of
9/11,
my
work
was
lacking
in
objectivity.
My
anger
towards
Spiegelmanus
writing
style
hindered
me
from
writing
well.
At
the
end
of
the
course,
I
realized
that
the
very
thing
that
had
helped
me
to
become
a
better
writer
and
to
love
writing
had
also
become
my
greatest
worry.
Today,
I
feel
that
my
personal
feelings
and
attachment
to
a
text
or
particular
topic
continue
to
impede
objectivity
and
may
impair
my
abilities
as
a
critical
reader
and
therefore
a
critical
writer.
In
my
first
year
of
college,
I
have
learned
a
lot
about
writing,
scientifically
and
non-scientifically.
I
have
learnt
that
while
it
is
good
to
write
correctly,
beautiful
writing
comes
with
inclusion
of
oneus
mind,
feelings
and
perspectives.
However,
I
have
also
discovered
that
too
much
emotion
can
easily
lead
a
writer
off
course.
As
I
progress
to
the
next
chapter
of
my
writing
process,
I
hope
to
learn
to
exercise
the
right
amount
of
feeling
and
to
avoid
unnecessary
attachment
to
literature
and
my
writing.
