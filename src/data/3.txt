I
honestly
can't
recall
a
beginning.
There
was
no
clarifying
moment
when
the
lightbulb
flashed
above
my
head
and
I
suddenly
knew
I
wanted
to
write.
Most
of
my
early
memories
of
writing
are
compilations
of
the
stories
I
continue
to
hear
over
the
years.
I've
heard
the
stories
so
many
times
that
I've
begun
to
wonder
if
I'm
remembering
the
story
or
the
experience
itself.
Before
I
could
even
read,
my
mother
explained,
I
would
insist
that
she
read
to
me
every
night
until
I
fell
asleep.
She's
a
teacher
and
would
bring
home
all
the
books
she
could
get
her
hands
on
so
I
would
have
something
new
to
read.
Then
she
would
complain
that
I
read
the
books
faster
than
she
could
get
them
home.
I
guess
writing
was
the
obvious
next
step.
I
wanted
to
create
what
I
loved
to
hear
and
explore.
One
story
that
my
mother
tells
me
over
and
over
again
involves
my
first
poetic
endeavor
in
the
second
grade.
It
was
National
Nutrition
month
at
my
school
and
I
wrote
a
poem
about
fruits,
vegetables,
and
regular
exercise.
My
mom
had
loved
it
so
much
that
she
brought
it
into
school
with
her.
She
made
copies
and
handed
them
out
to
her
each
of
her
students.
She
even
gave
a
copy
to
the
principal
who
read
it
aloud
over
the
loudspeaker
during
homeroom.
I
don't
remember
feeling
mortified
that
my
secret
little
poem
had
been
trumpeted
through
the
halls
of
that
entire
school.
Fortunately,
I
was
too
young
to
think
about
humiliation,
failure,
and
vulnerability.
I
was
just
happy
that
someone
could
get
enjoyment
out
of
something
I
had
created.
It
would
be
so
much
easier
if
all
writers
could
still
think
in
simpler,
more
child-like
terms.
As
I
grew
older,
I
inevitably
began
to
think
about
consequences.
The
standard
threats
of
failure,
criticism,
and
even
praise
prevented
me
from
showing
others
what
I
loved
to
do.
It
was
through
journal
writing
that
these
threats
no
longer
held
any
meaning.
This
type
of
free,
spontaneous
writing
allowed
me
to
create
a
separate
world
where
my
mind
could
wander
beyond
the
limits
I
set
for
myself
in
an
academic
setting.
My
journal
kept
me
sane.
When
everything
in
my
life
was
coming
undone,
I
could
always
pick
up
a
pen
and
speak
without
worrying
about
expectations,
dissention,
compliments,
or
explanations.
It
sounds
pretty
strange,
but
I
sometimes
I
felt
as
though
the
paper
was
a
bottomless
ocean.
When
no
one
was
looking,
I
could
empty
out
the
chaos
that
was
inside
my
head,
let
it
drift
away,
or
decide
that
I
want
to
scoop
it
back
out
again
before
it
sinks
into
blackness.
The
thoughts
that
would
never
escape
my
lips
would
seep
out
through
the
tip
of
my
pen.
Somehow
it
was
no
longer
chaos
when
I
read
it
on
the
paper.
There
are
so
many
small
and
large
moments
when
I
felt
I
took
a
step
forward,
a
few
steps
to
the
side,
and
countless
steps
in
reverse.
I
remember
seventh
grade
English
class
with
Mrs.
Bol.
We
were
about
to
receive
our
graded
book
reports.
I
had
done
my
report
on
A
Christmas
Carol
by
Charles
Dickens.
While
I
didn't
want
to
admit
it
to
myself,
I
couldn't
wait
to
see
her
response
to
my
paper.
The
next
day
in
class,
we
received
our
papers
back.
I
remember
carefully
turning
to
the
last
page
and
staring,
mouth
gaping,
at
that
horrifying,
enormous
scarlet
red
F.
I
felt
the
tears
burning
to
roll
down
my
face,
but
I
stiffened
my
lip
and
read
her
harsh
request
to
go
see
her
after
class.
She
was
probably
going
to
tell
me
that
my
report
made
no
sense,
that
she
had
recommended
me
for
remedial
help.
At
the
end
of
class,
the
bell
seemed
to
ring
forever.
I
made
the
long
journey
up
to
her
hard,
wooden
desk.
When
all
the
other
children
had
left
the
room,
she
explained
to
me
that
she
would
not
tolerate
plagiarism
in
her
classroom.
How
could
I
have
even
thought
of
copying
out
of
the
text
without
getting
caught?
So
much
for
my
stiff
upper
lip.
The
tears
poured
down
my
face
and
I
could
barely
make
a
response.
I
managed
to
blurt
out,
through
racks
of
sobs,
that
I
hadn't
copied
anything.
The
next
day,
when
I
brought
in
my
book
and
some
writing
samples,
she
didn't
say
that
much.
She
never
apologized
either.
I
was
enrolled
in
honors
English
the
following
fall.
While
there
were
teachers
who
continued
to
misread
and
mistreat
their
students,
there
were
also
a
handful
who
sincerely
saw
promise
in
the
people
sitting
in
desks
before
them.
During
my
sophomore
year
of
high
school,
I
took
a
Shakespeare
class.
I
really
hadn't
had
any
real
exposure
to
Shakespeare
and
didn't
really
know
what
to
expect.
As
the
course
progressed,
I
began
to
admire
the
dedication
my
teacher
had
toward
improving
his
students'
papers.
I
don't
think
he
realized
what
an
large
impact
he
had
on
my
perception
of
academic
writing.
He
was
the
first
to
show
me
the
mystical
powers
of
writers
bewilder,
delight,
anger,
awaken,
comfort,
and
energize
their
readers,
while
never
meeting
them
face
to
face.
Grades
no
longer
seemed
to
be
the
final
verdict.
When
you
accepted
a
grade
on
a
paper,
you
could
no
longer
improve
on
what
you
had
begun.
I
began
to
revise
my
papers
more
and
more.
I
wanted
my
words
to
be
clear,
supported,
forceful,
convincing.
I
didn't
want
to
put
limits
on
myself
by
declaring
a
paper
finished.
I
began
to
see
that
I
didn't
have
to
be
structured
all
of
the
time.
Some
things
needed
spontaneous
exploration,
random
probing,
to
arrive
at
any
conclusions.
Some
explorations
only
lead
to
more
questions.
I
tried
to
forget
about
grammar
for
a
while
and
focus
on
letting
my
mind
wander.
I
was
surprised
where
my
mind
could
take
me
when
I
wasn't
setting
limits
or
expectations.
During
my
junior
year
in
high
school,
I
attended
the
funeral
of
my
sophomore
year
history
teacher.
I
was
deeply
affected
by
the
experience
and
wrote
a
poem
afterward
describing
the
loss
and
regret
I
was
feeling.
A
few
months
later,
I
was
informed
that
a
scholarship
was
being
offered
in
her
memory.
While
filling
out
the
application,
I
thought
of
the
poem
I
had
written.
I
had
kept
it
hidden
safely
in
my
journal
since
the
day
I
had
written
it.
I
took
it
out
and
carefully
copied
it
onto
a
separate
piece
of
paper.
Before
I
even
realized
what
I
was
doing,
I
had
slipped
it
into
the
application
envelope
and
sealed
it
tightly
shut.
I
mailed
it
immediately,
before
I
had
time
to
think
or
rip
open
the
envelope
to
retrieve
its
contents.
It
was
done.
I
had
to
force
myself
to
stop
thinking
of
the
consequences.
A
couple
of
weeks
later,
I
received
a
phone
call
from
my
Shakespeare
teacher.
He
sounded
so
genuinely
pleased
when
he
told
me
I
had
won
the
scholarship.
He
also
added
that
he
and
others
on
the
selection
committee
had
been
especially
impressed
with
my
poem.
He
told
me
it
hammered
on
something
sincere,
emotional,
and
real.
While
a
few
other
students
had
received
money
as
well,
I'm
not
sure
that
each
of
them
received
such
a
phone
call.
I
can
still
feel
the
rush
of
pleasure
as
I
hung
up
the
phone,
not
sure
whether
to
scream
the
news
to
the
world,
or
just
savor
it
alone.
When
I
gave
myself
time
to
think
about
it,
I
tried
to
convince
myself
that
it
wasn't
really
a
big
deal.
I
still
wasn't
sure
if
I
wanted
people
to
know
what
I
could
do.
With
brilliant
writers
everywhere,
why
would
someone
listen
to
what
I
had
to
say?
As
I
headed
into
my
senior
year
of
high
school,
these
doubts
didn't
disappear.
I
did
manage
to
push
them
onto
the
sidelines
for
a
while
as
I
focused
on
getting
people
to
hear
what
I
had
to
say.
I
desperately
needed
input,
some
way
to
evaluate
the
success
of
my
own
writing.
When
someone
has
something
important
to
say,
they
have
to
discover
some
way
to
convince
others
that
their
ideas
are
significant
in
some
way,
that
their
thoughts
are
not
confined
to
a
single
body
and
mind.
If
just
one
person
could
find
take
away
some
truth
from
what
I
have
written,
something
that
sparked
an
interest,
probed
another
question,
or
gave
them
a
new
understanding,
I
wouldn't
feel
disappointment.
Sometimes
this
understanding
would
be
different
from
my
own,
and
I
would
get
a
glimpse
through
a
new
pair
of
eyes.
In
order
to
see
new
images
of
reality,
I
had
to
first
lead
people
closer
to
the
bottomless
waters
of
my
written
thoughts.
These
waters
were
only
getting
darker
and
dirtier
when
I
refused
to
let
anyone
near
them.
There
have
been
a
few
times
when
I
let
certain
people
dip
their
feet
in
and
test
out
the
temperature
of
these
waters.
My
family
had
recently
been
going
through
some
rough
times
and
I
turned
to
writing
when
no
one
seemed
to
want
to
talk
to
one
another.
At
the
time,
I
had
trouble
verbalizing
anything
to
my
mother.
Most
of
my
true
feelings
came
out
in
poems.
These
poems
made
sense
to
me,
comforted
me,
encouraged
me
to
be
strong
for
the
rest
of
the
family.
I
wanted
someone
else
to
feel
this
comfort
and
this
strength.
I
showed
one
of
these
poems
to
my
mother
because
I
didn't
want
her
to
lose
hope,
to
feel
alone,
even
when
the
house
was
filled
with
eerie
silence.
The
risk
I
took
when
I
handed
my
mother
my
poem
was
no
longer
important
when
I
looked
at
her
face
as
she
read
it.
There
were
tears
in
her
eyes,
but
she
radiated
happiness.
I
knew
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
someone
had
reached
out
to
her,
made
an
effort
or
a
gesture
of
some
understanding.
It
had
been
a
long
time
since
I
had
seen
a
real
smile
on
her
face.
Written
words
had
bridged
some
kind
of
gap
that
existed
between
us.
I
don't
think
either
of
us
knew
it
was
there
until
we
overcame
it.
This
event
encouraged
me
to
enter
the
poem
in
a
poetry
contest
later
that
year.
A
few
months
later,
the
poem
was
published
in
a
poetry
anthology.
I
hoped
that
someone
reading
it
might
relate
to
the
energy
of
feeling
I
had
wanted
to
express.
As
graduation
drew
closer,
I
began
to
write
all
the
time.
I
entered
writing
samples
in
the
literary
art
journal,
wrote
for
the
sports
page
of
the
school
newspaper,
and
continued
to
revise
as
many
papers
as
I
could.
More
of
my
teachers
began
to
comment
on
my
writing,
read
my
papers
aloud
in
class,
and
encourage
me
to
talk
more
in
class.
Despite
the
confidence
that
these
teachers
had
in
my
writing,
I
continued
to
remain
primarily
mute.
Verbal
confrontation
still
terrified
me.
I
wanted
so
badly
to
speak
the
words
that
seemed
to
flow
so
easily
onto
the
paper.
I
just
didn't
know
where
I
was
going
to
find
the
confidence
I
need
to
take
a
risk.
I
entered
college
with
a
mind
twisted
with
excitement,
confusion,
and
fear.
I
knew
that
college
professors
would
be
expecting
a
lot,
but
I
wasn't
really
sure
what
a
lot
meant.
I
was
ready
to
work
and
I
was
prepared
to
be
criticized
severely.
I
soon
realized
that
I
didn't
need
to
mentally
divide
what
I
wrote
into
separate
categories.
The
writing
I
did
for
school
didn't
need
to
exist
apart
from
the
writing
I
did
for
my
own
needs.
It
took
me
a
while
to
realize
that
I
could
combine
the
two,
that
my
experiences
could
help
me
react
intellectually
to
a
piece
of
literature
or
a
historical
event.
Writing
was
no
longer
purely
academic.
I
still
remember
my
first
year
seminar
pretty
clearly.
It
was
a
poetry
seminar
and
everyone
seemed
so
hesitant
to
speak
about
their
writing
experiences.
I
loved
to
hear
everyone
else
talk.
We
were
all
so
different,
but
we
were
all
their
to
learn
about
written
expression,
hidden
images,
meaningful
emotions.
Our
different
backgrounds
seemed
insignificant
when
we
began
to
examine
poems.
While
I
had
expected
to
write
more
poetry
than
we
were
actually
asked
to
do,
I
became
more
comfortable
letting
others
hear
my
thoughts.
I
hadn't
let
my
guard
down,
but
I
was
eager
to
hear
reactions
and
to
give
my
response
to
what
I
was
hearing.
While
grades
were
no
longer
my
primary
goal,
a
solid
A+
from
a
deeply
respected
professor
could
certainly
give
me
confidence
when
I
start
to
doubt
why
I
even
try
to
write
in
the
first
place.
The
support
and
advice
I
received
from
students
and
faculty
last
semester
gave
me
enough
confidence
to
look
for
a
job
where
I
could
do
what
I
love.
This
summer,
I
worked
with
a
graphic
artist
at
an
advertising
agency
near
my
house.
We
would
spend
hours
at
his
drawing
desk,
discussing
a
specific
copy
or
graphical
concept.
I
never
realized
how
much
thought,
how
much
of
yourself,
could
fit
into
a
single
word
or
phrase.
We
would
talk
about
the
type
of
audience
that
would
be
receiving
the
ad,
the
possibility
of
misreading,
the
words
and
images
that
open
eyes
and
persuade
minds.
I
loved
it.
I
loved
that
the
work
wasn't
disconnected
from
the
real
world,
real
thinking,
the
experiences
that
make
up
who
I
am.
Just
as
I
can't
really
recall
a
profound
beginning
to
my
writing
experience,
I
know
there
will
never
be
a
final
destination,
a
place
where
I
uncover
the
whole
truth,
put
my
mind
to
rest,
create
a
perfect
piece
of
writing.
I
am
thankful
that
there
is
no
finality,
no
outer
limits,
to
my
thinking
and
writing.
When
I'm
writing,
I
can
talk
about
my
early
childhood
while
acknowledging
my
leg
falling
asleep
or
the
running
water
in
the
bathtub.
Sometimes
there
is
order
in
being
disordered.
I
don't
want
to
be
limited
to
one
world,
one
group
of
people,
one
pair
of
eyes.
I
crave
feedback,
disagreement,
consenting
murmurs,
shaking
of
heads,
stubborn
smirks.
I
think
that
the
last
two
years
of
college
have
helped
to
extinguish
many
of
my
illusions
and
fears
about
revealing
myself
through
my
writing.
I
try
to
keep
my
eyes
and
ears
open,
really
listen
to
the
people
who
don't
speak
just
to
hear
themselves
speak.
I
don't
want
to
go
through
life
only
seeing
through
one
pair
of
eyes.
I
can
give
others
a
glimpse
into
my
world
through
my
writing,
but
it
doesn't
simply
end
when
that
writing
is
put
to
rest.
