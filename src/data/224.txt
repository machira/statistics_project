A
Good
Write
Spoiled
Writing,
in
an
ideal
state,
is
a
painless
task.
Private
journals
and
books
can
be
a
pleasurable
and
purifying
outlet
for
the
mind.
Jotting
down
quick
ideas
and
story
lines
is
exciting,
while
free
writing
about
random,
unrelated
thoughts
on
a
fresh
sheet
of
paper
is
cathartic
and
relaxing.
This
ideal
state,
my
ideal
state,
buckles
easily
under
outside
pressure.
Parents,
professors,
friends,
classmates,
peers,
employers,
rule
makers,
and
grammatical
wizards
who
offer
suggestions,
guidelines,
or
advice
can
create
heavy
tension,
because,
while
they
cannot
pry
open
my
skull
to
examine
the
source
of
my
ideas,
they
will
judge
the
finished
product
as
a
representation
of
my
intellect.
This
pressure
has
made
writing
both
exciting
and
challenging
to
me
throughout
my
development
as
a
writer.
I
have
enjoyed
communicating
on
paper
because
it
is
an
art
aimed
at
perfection
and
self-awareness.
For
me,
an
impeccable
performance
has
been
much
easier
to
come
by
via
paper
than
by
public
speaking
or
debate,
which
may
involve
unnecessary
blunders
or
serious
embarrassment.
I
have
been
writing
for
my
personal
enjoyment
since
I
learned
how
to
spell
in
kindergarten,
and
I've
been
in
love
with
the
writing
experience,
the
feel
of
a
sharpened
pencil
or
new
pen
between
my
fingers,
the
clean
blank
paper
opened
up
to
my
mind,
the
rush
of
ideas
onto
a
page,
ever
since
those
early
days.
Last
week
I
found
a
large
cardboard
box
in
my
basement
filled
with
hundreds
of
my
writing
samples
and
stories.
Delving
into
these
works,
I
have
realized
not
only
how
drastically
my
skills
and
style
have
developed,
but
also
how
fun
writing
can
be.
The
oldest
books
I
found
were
probably
written
in
first
grade,
the
age
I
started
reading
simple
books
and
drawing.
The
books
were
crude,
made
of
folded
colored
paper
and
stapled
together
once
or
twice
down
the
side.
I
must
have
kept
them
in
a
drawer
or
other
safe
place,
because
they
were
mostly
intact.
The
majority
of
these
early
books
were
filled
with
pictures
of
what
I'm
guessing
were
animals
and
only
a
few
words.
The
preexisting
circumstances
limited
me.
At
this
point
in
my
writing
career,
the
biggest
word
I
knew
was
my
own
name,
so
I
had
to
keep
things
brief.
Also,
and
this
may
be
the
first
time
I've
admitted
this
in
15
years:
I
had
a
problem
finishing
anything.
I
sometimes
only
made
it
to
step
one,
the
all-too-critical
Title-Making
phase,
before
new
ideas
would
suddenly
pop
into
my
head
for
a
better
story.
And
so
I'd
go
off
stapling
more
colored
paper
together,
envisioning
dozens
of
characters
and
plot
lines
while
actually
producing
nothing
in
the
end.
Satisfaction
came
to
me
through
the
idea
making
and
thought
processes,
not
with
a
finished
product.
Sadly,
my
capricious
writing
tendencies
have
not
changed
much
over
the
years.
In
addition,
since
first
grade
my
vocabulary
has
miraculously
increased
to
include
some
handy
words,
like
procrastination.
I
started
using
our
huge,
Atari
styled
computer
with
the
joystick
and
tri-colored
screen
to
write
stories
in
third
grade.
It
was
cumbersome,
it
was
dreary,
and
it
was
hard
to
learn
the
whole
typing
thing.
Still,
the
computer
screen
brought
a
sense
of
professionalism
to
my
writing
that
construction
paper
and
markers
never
did.
To
see
words
magically
appear
on
the
screen
was
a
new
thrill
for
me.
(In
the
80's,
anything
that
could
be
plugged
in
was
magic)
Using
the
printer
was
even
more
exciting
because
each
page
began
resembling
text
from
a
real
book.
Since
the
printer
needed
a
full
day
to
make
one
page,
however,
I
never
wrote
novels
over
four
paragraphs.
The
computer
made
writing
a
more
serious
project
for
me
because
it
allowed
me
to
save
tidbits
and
snippets
on
a
daily
basis.
I
could
work
on
one
or
two
stories
over
a
few
weeks
before
surrendering
to
boredom
and
moving
on.
Although
I
was
assigned
a
few
interesting
papers
to
write
in
third
and
fourth
grades,
I
wrote
mainly
for
myself.
Time
spent
writing
alone
in
my
room
or
typing
furiously
on
the
primitive
computer
downstairs
was
important
to
my
happiness.
I
felt
physically
relaxed
yet
mentally
energized,
and
I
appreciated
the
brief
retreat
from
outside
stress.
My
writing
is
no
longer
this
private
restful
refuge.
The
time
I
used
to
spend
dreaming
and
rambling
away
on
paper
is
now
spent
on
larger
academic
assignments
and
responsibilities.
I
no
longer
have
an
hour
slotted
in
my
day
to
write
animal
adventure
tales,
starring
character
favorites
such
as
Greedy
Gut
Grimer,
Selfish
Slug
Slimer,
and
Fluffy.
I
can't
say
that
I've
experienced
any
serious
story-writing
withdrawal
symptoms,
in
fact
I
still
do
not
understand
why
I
chose
such
annoying
names
for
the
animal
characters.
It's
no
wonder
these
embarrassing
tales
were
stored
away
in
a
dusty
cardboard
box
near
the
furnace.
I
will
admit,
however,
how
much
I
miss
taking
up
memory
on
a
computer
simply
for
silly
outpourings
of
my
mind.
Fortunately
the
decline
of
personal
story
writing
was
gradual,
and
the
new
assignments
in
school
became
more
interesting.
One
story
I
remember
well,
but
could
not
find
in
the
old
box,
is
my
fifth
grade
gem
Pegasus
Lost
Her
Wings.
I
cannot
recall
the
details
of
the
story,
only
the
exciting
circumstances
it
created.
Our
class
entered
a
statewide
contest
for
the
best
creative
story,
and
somehow
my
Pegasus
won
over
all
other
fifth
graders.
I
found
my
face
gracing
every
local
newspaper
in
town,
and
I
was
invited
to
Towson,
Maryland
later
that
month
to
read
my
story
at
an
academic
convention.
The
purpose
of
this
convention,
and
I'm
still
positive
of
this,
was
to
entertain
two
hundred
adults
with
a
buffet
of
tasty
food
and
five
terrified
children.
I
can't
remember
how
I
felt
during
this
day
of
torture,
but
in
all
246
pictures
my
mother
took
of
me
on
stage,
my
cheeks
matched
the
color
of
my
hot
pink
dress.
I
had
to
go
up
on
stage
last,
being
the
fifth
grade
winner,
and
stand
behind
a
7-foot
high
podium
to
read
my
story.
I
flew
through
it
with
the
style
and
finesse
of
a
beached
whale,
but
I
did
manage
to
finish
speaking
at
some
point
in
the
story
and
return
to
my
parents'
table
again.
Everyone
clapped,
probably
after
the
"applause"
sign
was
lowered
from
the
rafters
behind
my
head
on
stage.
Later,
on
the
ride
home,
after
a
hearty
back
slapping
and
hand
shaking
celebration,
my
mom
told
me
she
thought
I
had
skipped
a
page
up
there.
Considering
that
my
novel
was
only
three
or
four
pages
long,
missing
one
would
be
a
dire
mistake.
I
checked
through
my
little
stapled
book,
and
sure
enough,
there
was
a
page
stuck
to
another
that
I
hadn't
seen.
The
error
hadn't
phased
me
out
of
my
dazed
stupor
on
stage,
but
the
after
the
fact
pain
was
immense.
From
this
embarrassing
milestone
in
my
life,
I've
learned
that
mistakes
will
happen
that
I'll
have
to
struggle
through,
but
in
the
end,
my
biggest
critic
will
usually
be
my
own.
In
sixth
grade
I
crossed
another
landmark
on
my
writing
journey:
I
wrote
my
first
book
with
someone
else.
My
best
friend
Laura
and
I
both
loved
horses
and
writing,
so
we
foolishly
decided
to
publish
a
book
together.
We
thought
our
material
was
worth
publishing,
at
least.
Our
highly
competitive
natures
combined
with
my
realization
that
I
wasn't
the
only
creative
writer
in
the
universe
made
co-authoring
difficult.
The
book,
which
ended
up
being
about
30
pages,
was
impressive,
but
it
almost
cost
us
our
friendship.
I'm
glad
we
never
became
famous
for
it,
because
then
there'd
be
real
trouble.
From
that
blunder
in
my
writing
history,
I've
learned
not
to
involve
friends
closely
with
work.
I
think
I
have
a
point,
because
Benjamin
Franklin
said
the
same
thing.
High
school
brought
new
challenges
to
me
because
extensive
writing
was
required
for
many
subjects;
English,
Spanish,
history,
even
biology.
I
remember
my
AP
European
history
class
as
a
time
of
maturation
in
my
writing
style.
A
terrific
exercise
for
my
procrastinating
brain
was
the
daily
timed
essays,
requiring
fast
planning
and
clever
thinking
on
complex
issues
in
history.
A
journalism
class
also
inspired
efficiency
and
wit
in
my
writing
style.
We
wrote
under
pressure
and
within
length
limits
on
a
variety
of
real
and
creative
topics.
And
twice
a
week,
my
creative
writing
class
in
12th
grade
allowed
for
an
hour
of
creative
freestyle
I
had
craved
like
cookie
dough
since
childhood.
Writing
was
a
confidence
builder
in
high
school.
While
fights
with
boyfriends,
floundering
on
the
volleyball
court,
and
frustration
in
AP
Calculus
beat
me
down,
getting
back
many
A
papers
lifted
me
up.
As
I
headed
off
for
college,
I
had
many
anxieties
and
concerns,
but
writing
was
not
one
of
them.
If
beer
were
as
easy
to
come
by
as
writing
in
college,
I
would
be
in
good
shape.
Since
arriving
at
Lafayette,
I
have
grown
into
a
comfort
zone
with
writing.
I've
learned
the
basics
of
grammar
and
style,
and
may
have
even
developed
some
writing
quirks
of
my
own.
My
personal
system
has
been
well
supported
here
at
Lafayette,
as
professors
have
encouraged
elaboration
and
perseverance
rather
than
stylistic
makeovers
of
my
writing.
I
haven't
been
asked
into
any
elite
Best
Writers
guild,
but
I
have
gained
acceptance
as
a
writer.
The
first
professor
to
embrace
my
abilities
at
college
was
my
First
Year
Seminar
professor,
Suzanne
Westfall.
Her
enthusiasm
and
intelligence,
along
with
the
friendly,
open
discussions
she
provided,
inspired
me
to
voice
my
opinions
in
class
and
later
on
a
computerized
conference
board.
This
was
not
only
an
opportunity
to
write,
but
to
carry
out
lively
drawn
out
debates
with
classmates.
I
had
never
used
a
conference
board
before
this
point,
and
it
was
actually
a
lot
of
fun
posting
messages
and
waiting
for
a
response.
I
think
my
excitement
also
built
on
the
high
intelligence
of
my
classmates
at
Lafayette.
A
group
somewhat
different
than
my
high
school
peers,
these
students
were
my
equals
and
superiors,
thus
constantly
hitting
the
ball
back
in
my
court
and
keeping
my
mental
toes
dancing.
Professor
Westfall's
class
encouraged
more
than
glib
words
on
a
page,
it
demanded
clever
thinking.
At
the
end
of
the
semester
she
asked
us
to
write
our
own
"Chatauqua",
a
paradigm
for
living,
based
on
a
novel
we
had
studied
in
class
about
chatauquas.
I
enjoyed
this
assignment
for
the
chance
to
elaborate
on
memories
of
my
life
that
were
important
to
me,
and
to
reflect
on
ideas
and
discussions
brought
up
in
seminar
that
might
be
relevant.
One
of
the
most
comprehensive
and
complex
papers
I've
written
in
two
years
of
college
turned
out
to
be
a
successful
one,
as
both
my
professor
and
myself
praised
it.
(Then
again,
she
may
have
just
been
excited
that
this
paper
would
be
the
first
I
actually
completed
and
handed
in
on
time
all
semester.)
Preparing
for
my
major
in
behavioral
neuroscience
has
forced
me
to
digress
from
my
happy
trail
of
writing.
Labs
may
be
the
only
assignments
that
require
whole
words
and
actual
sentences;
chemical
hieroglyphics
will
be
my
primary
language
for
the
remainder
of
my
time
in
school.
Lafayette
does
require
writing
classes
for
Bachelor
of
Science
majors,
which
I
will
secretly
anticipate
as
a
welcome
refuge
from
organic
chemistry
and
molecular
biology.
While
fulfilling
a
major
is
important
for
graduation,
it
will
not
quell
my
thirst
for
a
clean
sheet
of
white
paper,
a
new
click
pen,
and
an
hour
to
myself
for
writing.
Writing
is
an
inevitable
part
of
intelligent
life,
a
certainty
I
will
relish
in
until
I'm
too
old
and
arthritic
to
hold
a
pen
in
my
teeth,
once
my
arms
have
fallen
off.
In
other
words,
nothing
can
spoil
this
passion.
My
love
for
writing
is
here
to
stay.
