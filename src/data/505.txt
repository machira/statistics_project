Writing
Reflection
Essay
As
I
reflect
on
my
history
as
a
writer,
I
am
reminded
that
growth
in
writing
is
anything
but
an
isolated
process.
I
became
a
more
effective
and
opinionated
writer
from
a
variety
of
sources
over
a
large
amount
of
time.
Following
my
writing
from
its
first
stages
to
the
present
quickly
reveals
an
evolutionary
development,
always
bringing
change.
This
change
has
been
caused
by
learning
in
the
classroom,
and
to
even
a
greater
extent,
living
in
society.
From
my
first
writing
experiences
in
first
grade
to
my
most
recent
twenty
page
research
paper,
I
have
always
been
exposed
to
different
writing
techniques.
New
people
and
new
opinions
influence
me;
this
in
turn
affects
how
I
communicate.
My
history
as
a
writer
starts
out
ordinary
but
practical.
Standard
assignments
and
formats
defined
my
writing
for
many
years.
As
I
gained
a
good
foundation,
I
slowly
gained
more
freedom
in
how
I
could
express
myself
in
writing.
It
is
when
I
could
add
a
more
personal
tone
to
my
essays
or
reflections
(actually
any
literary
genre),
that
I
understood
how
powerful
writing
could
be.
In
my
experience,
I
have
found
that
writing
is
often
more
effective
in
relaying
ideas
and
view
points
than
direct
conversation.
A
convincing
research
report
can
disclose
a
new
way
to
cure
a
disease
to
the
scientific
community.
A
compelling
short
story
can
challenge
the
way
someone
views
a
certain
societal
norm.
Writing
can
be
powerful,
influential,
and
instructive.
In
order
to
achieve
those
objectives
and
more
however,
it
must
be
done
correctly.
An
effective
writer
needs
a
strong
background
to
grow
and
improve
their
works.
They
must
have
a
distinct
beginning,
where
practicing
and
repeating
the
basics
are
essential.
They
must
then
begin
to
incorporate
their
own
ideas
into
set
structures
and
formats.
Lastly,
a
new
writer
must
expand
off
of
those
common
formats
into
more
creative
and
personal
techniques.
This
development
is
ongoing,
but
is
critical
in
creating
an
effective
writer.
It
is
also
the
general
progression
I
have
gone
through
to
become
the
writer
I
am
today.
My
first
memories
as
a
writer
come
from
the
home.
Even
before
I
entered
preschool,
I
would
listen
as
my
parents
read
me
short
stories
such
from
Corduroy,
Sesame
Street,
and
Disney.
For
many
evenings
I
was
kept
entertained
by
the
vivid
pictures
and
humorous
stories
that
went
along
with
them.
Little
did
I
know
that
lessons
such
as
Oclean
your
roomO
werenOt
the
only
facts
being
taught.
I
was
slowly
beginning
to
recognize
letters,
followed
by
patterns
of
letters,
and
then
finally
words
themselves.
My
first
experiences
reading
were
right
on
my
living
room
couch.
I
would
then
take
this
knowledge
to
the
classroom
in
kindergarten
and
first
grade
to
make
my
own
short
stories.
It
was
then
that
I
understood
reading
and
writing
went
hand
in
hand.
It
quickly
became
apparent
that
practice
and
repetition
were
the
primary
parts
of
improving
what
I
wrote.
The
early
grades
focused
on
having
us
describe
or
imagine
an
event
and
writing
it
down.
By
learning
from
our
mistakes,
we
slowly
improved
our
grammar
and
sentence
structure.
Once
the
basics
were
fairly
mastered,
it
was
in
third
and
fourth
grade
that
the
ideas
themselves
were
what
we
worked
on.
We
began
taking
our
first
notes
from
the
blackboard.
This
required
us
to
write
neatly
and
maintain
organization.
We
followed
these
guidelines
when
we
continued
to
write
our
own
stories
or
small
reports.
The
ideas
were
no
longer
randomly
entered;
they
had
to
follow
a
logical
and
sequential
pattern.
This
marked
the
first
time
that
my
writing
actually
became
interesting
and
informative;
it
started
to
flow.
I
was
creating
skeleton-like
structures
of
the
books
that
I
had
been
reading.
Middle
school
marked
new
milestones
in
my
growth
as
a
writer.
For
the
first
time,
fellow
students
got
involved
in
my
writing
progress.
Many
writing
classes
included
time
for
peer
review
and
peer
discussion,
so
that
we
could
learn
from
each
other
on
how
to
improve
our
papers.
I
was
much
more
comfortable
in
these
settings
because
I
was
more
relaxed
talking
to
someone
I
knew
and
related
to.
I
sometimes
remember
getting
better
feedback
from
a
classmate
then
I
did
reading
red
ink
on
my
paper.
This
format
continued
to
be
helpful
in
high
school
and
I
am
glad
that
the
opportunity
still
exists
at
college.
It
was
around
sixth
or
seventh
grade
that
I
was
introduced
to
the
five
paragraph
essay.
This
essay
was
useful
in
middle
school
because
it
helped
me
to
become
more
organized
in
my
writing.
I
had
to
clearly
state
an
argument
in
the
introduction.
I
had
to
back
up
this
argument
with
supporting
facts
and
details,
in
a
logical
order.
I
then
had
to
summarize
and
conclude
my
thoughts.
My
writing
became
more
convincing
as
well
as
interesting.
Unfortunately,
this
format
got
old
rather
quickly.
As
long
as
I
stuck
within
the
five
paragraph
guidelines,
I
was
basically
guaranteed
a
good
grade.
Not
until
high
school
was
I
allowed
to
experiment
outside
of
this
Ofive-sided
box.O
It
was
at
the
end
of
eighth
grade
that
I
noticed
what
an
impression
good
writing
could
make
on
people.
Everyone
in
my
social
studies
class
was
required
to
write
something
for
a
book
to
be
given
to
the
incoming
fifth
grade
class.
The
topics
ranged
from
the
school
band
to
cafeteria
lunches.
I
chose
to
write
about
something
a
little
more
deep:
peer
pressure
and
insecurity.
As
one
of
many
students
who
faced
influences
from
peers,
I
felt
it
my
duty
to
teach,
or
even
warn,
the
incoming
children.
I
hoped
that
my
paper
would
at
least
stop
some
of
them
to
think
before
they
made
wrong
decisions.
My
teacher
was
impressed.
That
spring,
I
was
surprised
to
hear
my
name
called
at
the
eighth
grade
award
ceremony.
No,
I
had
not
won
the
science
award
as
I
had
hoped,
but
something
even
better.
I
was
co-recipient
of
the
Junior
Humanitarian
Award.
My
article
about
fighting
peer
pressure
had
earned
me
the
praise
of
my
teachers.
In
their
eyes,
I
was
on
my
way
in
becoming
a
good
person.
That
day
I
realized
that
an
effective
piece
of
writing
should
not
just
be
well
constructed,
it
must
be
written
with
meaning
and
feeling
as
well.
I
began
thinking
of
what
changes
could
be
made
by
simply
arguing
my
view
point.
High
school
brought
change,
and
writing
was
no
exception.
It
was
there
that
I
was
allowed
to
escape
the
conformed
structure
of
the
five
paragraph
essay
and
begin
to
experiment
with
new
methods
of
expression.
Short
stories
and
research
papers
were
two
new
methods
that
allowed
more
freedom
in
writing
style.
The
one
class
that
stands
out
the
most
is
the
creative
writing
class
that
I
took
senior
year.
From
day
one
I
was
impressed
by
the
lack
of
rules
in
nearly
every
assignment.
No
longer
was
a
standard
format
required
or
a
set
number
of
paragraphs
emphasized.
It
was
there
that
I
wrote
my
first
childrenOs
book,
a
few
poems,
and
some
of
my
favorite
short
stories.
I
also
found
that
sharing
more
personal
writing
was
not
as
intimidating
as
I
had
originally
thought.
My
classmates
and
teachers
were
very
supportive
of
my
writing,
and
were
very
positive
in
their
comments
or
criticisms.
It
was
clear
that
working
with
others
helps
to
produce
stronger
writing
from
new
ideas
and
suggestions.
I
only
wish
other
classes
I
took
emphasized
creativity
and
self
expression
through
writing
as
much
as
that
class
did.
Another
strong
element
that
began
in
middle
school
and
was
carried
to
high
school
was
the
reading-writing
connection.
Books,
growing
in
complexity,
were
not
only
analyzed
and
critiqued,
but
were
written
about
as
well.
Writing
reports
on
class
novels
began
as
five
paragraph
essays.
I
believe
this
was
the
first
time
we
put
this
format
to
use,
for
theme
or
symbol
evaluation
in
a
book.
I
enjoyed
nearly
every
book
I
read
in
high
school;
in
fact
IOve
purchased
most
of
them
over
the
past
few
years
to
reread
them.
Novels
such
as
The
Catcher
in
the
Rye
and
Ethan
Frome
were
entertaining
and
valuable.
Our
teachers
chose
these
novels
for
us
because
they
knew
they
spoke
of
deeper
meanings
and
lessons.
It
is
very
clear
now
that
most
of
those
meanings
are
universal.
To
write
about
these
books
in
more
complex
essays
wasnOt
as
much
of
a
chore
as
earlier
five
paragraph
essays
had
been.
This
is
because
I
actually
related
and
agreed
with
the
themes
I
was
explaining.
School
writing
was
finally
serving
a
purpose
above
just
getting
a
grade.
Overall,
I
am
pleased
of
how
my
writing
progressed
in
grade
school.
The
middle-high
school
transition
is
an
ideal
time
to
begin
working
with
new
forms
of
writing.
By
that
age
I
was
well
accustomed
to
standard
rubrics
and
was
ready
to
build
on
my
knowledge.
More
creative
pursuits
inspire
the
writer
and
engage
the
reader.
They
allow
the
writer
to
create
unexpected
turns,
original
writing
styles,
and
a
free
voice.
During
the
early
grades,
I
was
encouraged
and
applauded
for
my
efforts
in
following
strict
guidelines.
Creativity
was
important,
but
seemed
more
of
a
goal
in
art
class
than
it
did
in
writing.
As
I
got
older,
I
was
allowed
to
experiment
more
with
writing
and
forge
my
own
path
in
some
respects.
Grading
was
tougher
and
could
be
discouraging,
but
the
opportunity
to
do
more
with
classic
assignments
still
existed.
I
was
much
fonder
of
the
freedom
than
the
restriction.
Upon
arriving
at
Lafayette,
I
felt
prepared
and
ready
for
college
writing.
By
prepared
I
mean
that
I
had
been
exposed
to
many
different
forms
of
writing
and
had
a
good
amount
of
time
to
practice
them.
I
could
explain
myself
better
and
had
improved
my
ability
to
analyze
and
understand
more
complex
writings.
Of
course,
there
was
much
more
to
learn,
but
I
had
a
good
foundation.
To
my
surprise,
I
received
very
few
O20
page
papersO
or
thought
provoking
writing
assignments
I
heard
about
from
other
students
and
relatives.
As
a
chemistry
major,
I
knew
that
lab
reports
would
be
a
primary
task,
but
not
my
only
task.
History
classes
and
my
first
year
seminar
gave
few
writing
tasks.
In
a
way
I
felt
under
challenged
and
over
prepared.
I
asked
myself,
OisnOt
writing
a
major
aspect
of
all
subjects?O
After
my
first
year
however,
my
responsibilities
in
writing
grew
and
I
was
asked
to
write
and
evaluate
more.
I
will
even
be
submitting
a
research
report
for
publication
into
an
inorganic
chemistry
journal
next
year.
This
report
will
be
based
on
my
ongoing
independent
research.
Writing
in
science
tends
to
sound
very
official,
focused,
and
honestly,
boring.
I
understand
that
its
purpose
is
to
report
data,
explain
findings,
and
observe
the
natural
world.
Sometimes
writing
in
this
restricted
form
is
very
tedious
and
tiresome
because
of
its
dull
format
and
advanced
vocabulary.
However,
writing
in
chemistry,
biology,
or
any
scientific
fields
needs
this
structure
to
be
effective.
Scientific
findings
need
to
be
read
and
understood
around
the
world
and
by
a
broad
audience.
New
discoveries
need
to
be
reproducible
so
that
medicines
and
consumer
products
can
be
created.
Therefore
a
concise
report
of
all
steps,
decisions,
and
results
must
be
put
forth.
Writing
in
science
is
critical
to
establishing
improvement
and
advancement
in
changing
field.
While
I
find
writing
about
chemistry
rather
repetitive
and
stale,
chemistry
itself
is
exciting.
I
have
had
several
other
personal
experiences
in
writing
that
have
impacted
my
life.
One
special
item
is
my
journal.
I
love
to
record
things.
Journal
writing
lets
me
organize
my
thoughts
and
feelings
in
one
location.
It
serves
as
a
back-up
memory
as
well.
It
is
humanly
impossible
to
remember
all
of
the
important
events,
inspirations,
and
emotions
that
fill
someoneOs
mind
everyday.
A
journal
keeps
these
moments
on
paper,
so
that
the
creator
and
anyone
else
can
read
and
reflect
on
them.
I
have
kept
a
journal
on
and
off
for
over
ten
years.
One
of
my
favorite
things
to
do
is
read
how
I
viewed
things
as
kid.
There
is
no
better
way
to
do
this
than
to
actually
read
what
I
wrote
then!
Journals
are
like
people
textbooks
to
me.
They
teach
you
about
a
person
and
give
examples
of
what
is
important
to
them.
They
also
allow
writers
to
express
themselves.
I
also
have
an
interest
in
music.
I
can
listen
to
practically
all
kinds,
but
classic
rock,
punk,
and
emo
are
my
favorites.
I
like
the
music
because
it
is
fun
(I
play
the
drums
and
can
appreciate
a
good
beat).
I
like
the
lyrics
because,
as
is
the
case
in
many
genres
of
music,
they
have
deeper
meaning.
They
are
written
to
convey
a
message
and
let
out
a
viewpoint.
There
are
many
artists
that
I
relate
too
and
that
have
influenced
how
I
think
about
life
situations
for
the
better.
I
rarely
write
my
own
music,
but
I
spend
a
lot
of
time
listening
to
it.
This
form
of
writing
has
had
a
large
impact
on
my
growth
as
a
person.
Another
form
of
writing
comes
from
other
time
periods.
Since
middle
school,
I
have
been
a
huge
fan
of
local
history
as
well
as
currency
collecting.
My
work
at
the
Lafayette
College
Archives
as
well
as
my
high
school
archives
has
given
me
great
exposure
to
historical
documents.
Reading
old
literary
works,
whether
it
is
a
newspaper
or
senior
thesis,
is
not
only
informative
about
a
particular
person
and
time,
it
is
fun.
I
enjoy
thinking
what
it
must
have
been
like
to
live
in
a
time
period
where
a
particular
book
was
written.
I
enjoy
looking
at
the
signatures
from
two
dollar
bill
from
1865,
created
mere
miles
from
my
house.
This
form
of
writing
takes
a
message
and
transcends
it
across
generations
spanning
several
centuries.
Much
more
history
can
be
learned
from
a
personal
account
than
a
textbook.
I
think
many
individuals
overlook
the
power
of
writing,
I
being
one
of
them.
Writing
educates
others,
records
materials,
expresses
ideas,
and
reflects
on
events.
Personally,
I
think
that
through
writing
I
have
become
a
better
communicator
and
even
a
better
listener.
I
know
that
there
is
much
more
to
be
gained
from
others
in
writing
and
through
conversation.
I
know
I
have
a
great
deal
to
improve
on
in
writing:
some
style
techniques,
vocabulary,
and
creating
more
simple
sentences.
Looking
back
on
my
experience
thus
far
shows
that
writing
plays
a
more
important
role
in
my
life
than
I
previously
thought.
I
also
realize
that
it
can,
and
hopefully
will,
play
an
even
larger
one.
Writing
should
be
used
to
its
full
potential.
I
have
gained
a
lot
from
beginnings
and
have
improved
greatly.
However,
I
believe
good
writers
are
always
learning
and
experimenting
with
new
techniques.
I
hope
to
write
my
first
autobiography
within
the
next
two
years.
When
beginning
this
project,
I
need
to
ask
myself,
Ohow
do
I
want
to
be
remembered?O
Should
I
confine
my
life
story
within
a
dry
five
paragraph
type
report?
Or
do
I
dare
expand
what
I
know
now
and
create
an
inviting
book
that
is
both
fun
and
easy
to
read?
I
look
forward
to
expanding
my
potential
as
a
writer
for
the
rest
of
college
and
beyond.
I
know
that
it
will
be
something
worth
remembering.
