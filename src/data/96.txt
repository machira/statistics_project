My
First
Writing
Experiences
by
I
don't
remember
my
exact
first
writing
experience.
While
Fm
sure
it
must
have
been
some
type
of
composition
about
my
summer
vacation
when
I
was
in
the
first
grade,
it
wasn't
anything
memorable.
The
first
writing
experience
I
had
that
really
stands
out
for
me
actually
took
place
when
I
was
about
9
or
10,
and
it
wasn't
a
school
related
writing
experience.
When
I
was
in
the
third
grade
I/like
most
kids
my
age)
had
become
obsessed
with
baseball.
While
my
poison
was
the
New
York
Mets,
I
also
became
enthralled
with
the
great
players
of
yesteryear.
So
one
evening
(or
afternoon,
or
actually
it
could
have
been
a
morning)
I
took
pencil
and
paper
to
hand
and
attacked
my
World
Book
encyclopedia.
In
those
books
I
found
the
brief
biographical
summaries
of
the
careers
of
such
greats
as
Ted
Williams,
Hank
Aaron,
Willie
Mays,
and
Roberto
Clemente.
Although
what
I
wrote
on
my
sheets
of
red
lined
paper
was
basically
a
summary
of
what
was
written
in
the
encyclopedias,
I
was
pleased
with
what
I
had
written
and
even
more
pleased
with
the
length
of
my
writing-nearly
two
pages!
My
career
as
a
writer
had
begun.
Every
fifth
grader
in
the
country
has
to
take
a
standardized
writing
test,
with
the
highest
possible
score
to
be
received
a
16.
For
months,
my
classmates
and
I
prepared
with
Mrs.
Hoffman
for
the
test
which
consisted
of
two
essay
questions.
The
questions
were
a
tricky
lot,
ranging
from
such
subjects
as
"What
would
I
do
if
I
had
1
million
dollars"
to
"What
have
I
accomplished
in
my
life
that
I
am
the
most
proud
of'.
While
I
don't
remember
what
I
wrote,
I
do
remember
the
topic
of
one
of
the
essays
"What
would
you
do
if
you
met
your
exact
twin^Mhis
topic
allowed
me
to
employ
what
I
believe
is
my
best
strength
as
a
writer,
my
creativity.
I
received
a
15
out
of
16
and
had
the
second
highest
grade
in
my
class.
As
I
got
older,
and
school
got
more
difficult,
more
breezy
topics
for
writing
assignments,
such
as
''what
would
I
do
if
I
had
a
million
dollars"
were
abandoned
for
heavier
topics.
When
I
was
in
8th
grade,
I
had
to
write
my
first
real
research
paper
on
a
current
event.
Throughout
elementary
school
and
junior
high,
I
was
in
accelerated
classes.
In
most
of
these
accelerated
classes
a
rigid
structure
for
writing
was
emphasized
(I
would
say
even
enforced).
For
every
paper
we
were
given
a
topic.
We
were
then
required
to
brainstorm
on
the
topic,
free
associating
as
many
ideas
as
we
could
with
the
given
topic.
We
were
then
required
to
organize
our
thoughts
on
little
diagrams.
Once
our
thoughts
were
organized,
we
were
required
to
write
rough
copies,
followed
by
final
copies,
which
had
to
differ
in
some
small
way
from
the
rough
copy.
While
this
may
have
been
helpful
for
research
papers,
we
were
also
required
to
do
this
in
our
poetry
writing
unit,
which
I
believe
stifled
creativity
by
making
the
creative
process
nearly
cumbersome.
We
were
also
required
to
do
this
in
every
accelerated
class
with
writing
through
junior
high
and
through
our
senior
year
in
high
school.
I
think
by
the
time
we
were
18,
we
should
have
been
able
to
decide
for
ourselves
whether
or
not
we
wanted
to
use
such
an
archaic
method
of
writing.
For
someone
like
myself,
whose
attributes
in
writing
were
rooted
in
my
creativity,
this
method
of
writing
was
always
more
hurtful
than
helpful.
I
would
find
myself
writing
the
paper
first,
then
going
back
and
filling
in
the
brainstorm,
organize
and
rough
copy
steps
later.
While
the
papers
I
wrote
in
high
school
were
fairly
received
(usually
scoring
in
the
range
of
80-90)
I
also
looked
at
my
writing
as
underachieving.
A
prime
example
of
my
desire
to
write
freely
and
creatively
conflicted
with
the
rigid
writing
structure
presented
to
us
in
high
school
involves
the
story
"The
Scarlet
Letter".
In
my
eleventh
grade
english
class,
we
(like
every
other
eleventh
grade
english
class
in
the
country)
were
required
to
read
"The
Scarlet
Letter".
On
the
day
before
our
two
week
Christmas
break
was
to
begin,
the
class
was
split
into
4
groups
and
each
given
a
creative
assignment
related
to
"The
Scarlet
Letter"
to
present
before
the
rest
of
the
class.
After
completing
my
assignment,
I
was
asked
by
several
of
my
classmates
to
help
them
with
their
projects.
One
of
the
projects
was
a
David
Letterman
style
Top
Ten
list
about
the
story.
The
three
or
so
items
I
contributed
to
the
top
ten
list
were
incredibly
well
received
by
the
class.
During
my
two
week
Christmas
vacation,
I
began
to
work
on
a
paper
for
that
English
class
about
"The
Scarlet
Letter".
I
was
disappointed
that
I
could
not
apply
my
creativity
to
an
analytical
paper
about
"The
Scarlet
Letter".
Thus,
I
went
through
the
motions
and
wrote
a
lackluster
paper
about
the
book,
which
I
received
an
85
on.
Despite
my
ability
to
write,
my
English
grades
were
always
my
lowest.
If
I
could
figure
out
a
way
to
reconcile
this
conflict
between
structure
and
creativity,
I
would
be
at
the
top
of
my
class.
When
I
was
a
senior
in
high
school,
I
took
a
class
called
British
Literature.
My
teacher,
Bob
Odum,
allowed
us
more
freedom
in
our
writing
assignments.
For
example,
when
we
read
the
Shakespearean
love
sonnets,
instead
of
having
us
analyze
them,
he
told
us
simple
to
write
an
essay
about
what
love
means
to
us.
I
still
have
this
essay
saved
in
a
drawer
two
and
a
half
years
after
I
wrote
it,
because
it
is
the
only
essay
I
ever
wrote
in
high
school
that
I
received
a
perfect
score
of
100
on.
Still,
since
that
essay
was
primarily
a
creative
writing
assignment,
it
didn't
help
me
overcome
my
inability
to
juxtapose
creativity
and
good
structure
in
a
single
essay.
This
was
accomplished
in
my
First
Year
Seminar.
The
first
essay
I
had
to
write
in
my
First
Year
Seminar
was
a
simple
analytical
essay
of
a
book
we
had
read
in
my
seminar.
I
applied
the
same
boring
techniques
I
had
learned
in
high
school.
Imagine
my
shock
when
I
received
my
paper
back
with
a
grade
of
68.
For
starters,
for
every
grammatical
error
we
made,
we
lost
a
point.
In
a
three
page
paper,
I
made
8
grammatical
errors.
Which
proves
one
thing:
I
didn't
know
anything
about
grammar.
I
still
don't.
When
our
teachers
were
teaching
us
brainstorming
and
organization,
they
should
have
been
teaching
us
grammar.
The
professor
also
said
that
my
ideas
were
well
organized
but
not
very
well
executed.
It
was
then
that
I
realized
that
first
of
all,
since
I
was
a
Government
and
Law
major,
I
would
fail
out
if
I
couldn't
figure
out
how
to
write
correctly.
Second
of
all,
and
most
importantly,
I
figured
out
that
there
isn't
one
set
technique
to
writing
a
paper.
I
realized
that,
unlike
how
I
was
taught
in
high
school,
I
needed
to
approach
each
paper
differently,
depending
on
how
I
felt
about
it.
Since
then,
I
have
used
the
writing
techniques
I
learned
in
high
school,
but
only
when
I
needed
to.
I
have
also
written
papers
straight
through
,
in
one
sitting,
without
a
brainstorm,
organize
step
or
rough
copy.
The
two
techniques
have
been
equally
successfully,
only
because
they
have
been
used
properly.
I
have
grown
since
my
days
as
a
chronicler
of
baseballs
great
players,
and
I'm
sure
I
will
continue
to
grow.
