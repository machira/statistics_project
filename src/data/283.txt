I've
done
it.
I've
broken
the
mold
of
the
"traditional"
introduction
and
my
usual
tactics
for
getting
the
attention
of
the
reader.
The
safe
crutch
of
continually
relying
on
a
quotation
(my
classic
paper
starter
technique)
to
be
the
catalyst
for
my
paper
has
been
voluntarily
discarded
and
replaced
with
an
invisible
support
of
self-confidence
and
an
allowance
to
risk
as
well
as
to
fail.
While
this,
of
course,
has
not
occurred
over
night,
throughout
the
past
year,
several
writing
experiences,
both
as
the
author
and
as
the
audience,
have
brought
me
to
the
realization
that
I
had
become
what
I
disliked
the
most--
an
inflexible
writer.
Three
laboratory
classes
in
one
semester,
all
with
set
patterns
of
writing
and
development
to
be
stringently
followed,
are
enough
to
make
even
William
Faulkner
fall
into
a
habit
of
writing
in
a
traditional
way.
No
risk,
no
failure.
Biology
requires
a
format
so
strict
that
we
are
given
a
paper
before
each
laboratory
detailing
absolutely
everything
that
is
needed
for
the
report
we
are
to
write
to
be
"quality."
Chemistry
tradition
forces
our
teaching
assistants
to
write
up
most
of
the
information
they
are
looking
for
in
our
lab
reports
on
the
board,
and
psychology
is
so
set
in
its
pattern
of
writing
in
American
Psychological
Association
style
that
it
even
has
a
voluminous
reference
manual
that
must
be
adhered
to
if
one
desires
to
write
"professionally."
However,
nothing
is
inherently
corrupt
with
these
patterns
of
forming
written
works.
The
need
to
write
in
a
patterned,
set
way
reveals
the
need
to
enable
everyone
to
gain
access
to
and
understand
information
in
a
chosen
field.
Unfortunately,
these
patterns
of
writing
were
corrupting
my
authorship
and
even
the
very
way
I
thought
about
writing
in
general.
Instead
of
delving
into
the
creative
causeways
of
my
mind,
I
found
myself
simply
"going
through
the
motions"
of
writing
what
I
had
to
get
the
grade
that
I
desired.
My
motives
for
writing
were
all
skewed.
At
one
point,
I
didn't
even
feel
as
though
I
was
learning
the
material;
I
was
just
learning
the
pattern
of
what
I
had
to
say
in
my
laboratory
reports
to
get
an
A.
Experiences
as
a
WA
during
the
first
semester
of
last
year
also
inadvertently
helped
to
strengthen
my
ignorance
of
how
to
do
more
than
simply
write
what
the
audience
wanted
to
see.
For
instance,
I
continually
had
students
asking
me
if
I
thought
that
their
papers
were
"good
enough"
to
earn
them
the
grade
they
desired.
I
can
even
recall
one
specific
conference
in
which
a
girl
came
out
and
directly
asked
me,
"So
what
exactly
do
I
really
have
to
do
to
get
an
A?"
While
I
would
tell
the
students
that
it
was
necessary
to
follow
the
instructions
given
in
order
to
write
a
high
quality
paper,
I
would
usually
fail
to
mention
that
it
was
the
motive
behind
following
those
directions
that
separated
quality
papers
from
the
masses
of
mediocre
ones.
I
further
realized
the
debilitating
effects
that
writing
a
paper
for
the
wrong
reasons
can
have
on
people
when
I
went
into
an
afternoon
conference
with
a
boy
named
Andrew.
This
was
the
second
meeting
in
which
we
had
conferenced
together
regarding
one
specific
assignment,
and
he
approached
our
meeting
with
no
more
confidence
than
he
had
in
the
first
one.
Andrew
went
on
to
explain
that
he
was
having
difficulty
composing
a
suitable
working
thesis,
and
he
seemed
to
become
more
frustrated
as
we
spoke.
After
awhile,
it
dawned
on
me
that
he
had
come
to
me
in
the
hope
that
I
would
compose
his
thesis
for
him
since
I
had
an
"in"
as
to
what
the
professor
wanted.
In
other
words,
he
was
more
interested,
not
in
actually
thinking
and
learning
about
the
topic
he
was
to
write
about,
but
in
what
was
required
to
write
an
"A"
paper.
His
thoughts
were
only
set
on
this,
and
he
was
becoming
inflexible.
It
was
at
this
moment
that
I
further
realized
my
inadvertent
approval
of
writing
for
the
wrong
reasons
since
I
had
only
told
the
students
that
they
should
write
what
the
professor
wanted,
not
that
they
should
do
this
in
order
to
write
a
quality
paper
instead
of
to
simply
get
a
good
grade.
To
make
matters
worse,
several
other
students
began
coming
to
me
with
"writer's
block,"
asking
if
I
had
ideas
for
a
thesis
or
any
thoughts
about
how
to
set
their
paper
up
even
though
they
had
not
really
tried
to
do
so
themselves.
Instead
of
asking
questions
and
forcing
them
to
talk
about
the
assignment
itself
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
a
thesis
or
original
idea
from
them,
I
found
myself
giving
the
students
thesis
topic
suggestions
directly
since
this
seemed
to
be
what
assuaged
their
fears
of
writing
the
most.
This
was
practically
the
same
as
what
had
happened
in
the
three
labs
I
was
taking
that
semester--
the
ingredients
to
write
a
high
quality
paper
were
being
given
out,
and
the
writers
weren't
being
forced
to
bend
their
own
minds
to
achieve
quality
work
themselves.
In
other
words,
they
were
being
given
the
chance
to
become
inflexible
and
to
not
have
to
think.
At
the
time,
I
didn't
realize
that
this
action
of
handing
out
direct
thesis
suggestions
without
even
attempting
to
get
the
students
to
think
up
some
on
their
own,
as
well
as
my
leading
them
to
believe
that
it
was
OK
to
write
well
solely
to
receive
an
A,
was
turning
the
students
into
invariable
writers
set
on
only
one
goal:
to
write
what
others
wanted
to
hear.
The
need
to
change
my
motives
for
writing
became
apparent
to
me
when
I
was
relaxing
and
an
idea
for
a
poem
popped
into
my
head.
However,
when
I
went
to
elaborate
on
it,
I
found
I
couldn't
find
the
words
adequate
enough
to
express
myself.
I
had
lost
the
ability
to
think
outside
of
"the
box"
of
a
writing
assignment
sheet
or
a
lab
write-up
outline,
and
I
realized
that
when
there
was
no
grade
associated
with
writing,
it
was
virtually
impossible
for
me
to
do
it
and
feel
that
it
was
quality
work.
This
light
bulb
of
a
realization
began
a
reversal
process
in
my
writing
patterns
during
the
end
of
the
first
semester
of
last
year.
An
upper
level
English
class
called
Literary
Questions
during
the
second
semester
of
last
year
also
served
as
a
great
impetus
to
this
change.
It
was
in
here
that
we
were
given
very
open-ended
writing
assignments--
none
of
the
picky,
detail
by
detail
layouts
like
those
in
laboratory
classes.
Because
of
this,
I
had
no
crutch
on
which
to
lean
that
would
directly
show
me
what
to
write
in
order
to
get
an
A.
The
ideas
for
producing
an
excellent
paper
had
to
come
from
my
head.
I
recall
struggling
over
the
first
assignment
and
even
going
to
the
professor
to
see
if
I
could
have
her
read
the
paper
while
I
was
in
her
office
so
that
I
might
be
able
to
catch
her
"gut"
reaction
to
it.
Not
knowing
what
would
get
me
an
A
and
not
having
control
over
whether
or
not
I
covered
all
of
the
items
on
the
"checklist"
for
mentioning
everything
the
audience
wanted
to
see
was
very
frustrating
to
me,
but
it
helped
to
break
me
from
the
habit
of
writing
for
the
wrong
motivation.
Japanese
class
also
freed
me
from
inflexible
writing
because
all
we
needed
to
do
to
obtain
an
A
was
turn
in
our
assignments.
We
were
continually
encouraged
to
try
to
compose
new
sentences
even
if
we
weren't
sure
that
the
structure
or
organization
was
correct.
This
was
wonderful
because
then
I
could
create
stories
in
any
fashion
I
chose
without
the
added
worry
that
my
creativity
might
not
be
enough
to
earn
me
an
A.
This
completely
erased
the
fear
of
failure,
and
it
gave
me
a
great
sense
of
accomplishment
when
I
did
actually
compose
a
story
with
correct
tenses
and
sentence
patterns.
However,
the
event
that
led
most
to
the
vanquishing
of
my
inelastic
writing
style
was
one
specific
WA
conference
with
a
girl
named
Beth
during
my
first
semester
of
WAing.
She
would
always
come
to
our
conferences
late,
smelling
of
cigarette
smoke,
and
wearing
clothes
that
were
falling
off
of
her
frame.
Furthermore,
in
our
two
previous
conferences,
Beth
seemed
as
though
she
would
rather
have
been
in
boot
camp
than
writing
her
assignments.
Needless
to
say,
I
wasn't
expecting
too
much
when
I
went
into
this
particular
conference.
She
walked
into
the
WA
room
in
her
usual
garb
with
her
usual
stench
of
smoke.
However,
she
did
not
have
her
usual
"I'd
rather
be
doing
100
push-ups"
aura
about
her.
Instead,
she
came
in
smiling,
and
when
she
sat
down,
she
immediately
began
telling
me
about
her
ideas
of
how
she
wanted
to
compare
the
people
in
The
Iliad
to
the
hippies
of
the
60's.
She
had
pages
of
notes
that
she
had
scribbled,
and
so
many
ideas
that
she
must
have
talked
for
about
10
minutes
straight.
It
was
so
refreshing
to
see
this
in
any
student,
let
alone
Beth.
However,
at
the
end
of
her
colossal
list
of
ideas
came
a
frown
and
a
discouraged
look.
She
was
questioning
whether
or
not
this
would
be
an
"appropriate"
way
to
approach
the
assignment
because
she
feared
that
the
professor
might
not
find
it
amusing
that
she
decided
to
compare
The
Iliad
to
the
"free
love"
generation
of
the
recent
past.
In
other
words,
she
was
worried
about
the
end
result,
the
grade.
We
talked
over
additional
ideas
for
awhile
until
we
decided
together
that
it
would
be
best
to
take
the
risk
and
write
about
the
idea
she
was
passionate
over
even
if
it
might
mean
not
getting
a
decent
grade.
If
it
was
a
well-written
paper
but
the
professor
happened
to
not
approve
of
it,
it
was
still
a
well-written
paper.
I
think
it
was
a
turning
point
in
writing
for
her,
but
this
made
me
realize
that
my
thoughts
about
writing
were
changing
from
what
they
had
been
in
the
semester
beforehand,
and
it
spurred
me
to
"put
my
money
where
my
mouth
is,"
take
my
own
advice
in
the
future,
and
get
away
from
invariable
writing
patterns.
After
this
conference,
the
way
I
WAed
changed.
Furthermore,
learning
to
write
my
own
assignment
without
the
motivation
solely
to
get
an
A
also
transformed
how
I
WAed.
I
went
into
my
job
as
Writing
Associate
for
my
VAST
class
extremely
excited
and
ready
to
help
others
write
quality
papers
that
allowed
them
to
express
themselves
in
areas
they
were
passionate
about
rather
than
only
in
areas
that
would
always
guarantee
them
an
acceptable
grade.
However,
I
didn't
have
any
students
like
Beth.
In
fact,
most
students
resented
my
attitude
that
writing
shouldn't
be
centered
on
getting
the
best
grade
possible.
All
they
wanted
to
do
was
zip
through
the
assignment
in
the
shortest
amount
of
time
that
would
still
allow
them
to
pass
the
course.
I
didn't
know
how
to
convey
what
I
was
feeling
to
students
who
didn't
want
to
hear
what
I
had
to
say,
and
because
of
this,
some
of
the
conferences
were
done
solely
because
it
was
mandatory,
not
because
I
or
the
student
thought
it
would
be
beneficial.
However,
these
conferences
made
me
realize
that
I
was
now
being
inflexible,
not
in
how
I
was
writing
or
in
how
I
was
telling
others
to
write,
but
in
thinking
that
everyone
would
have
the
same
ideas
about
writing
as
I
had.
I
just
automatically
thought
that
everyone
could
be
like
Beth
had
been,
if
only
they
had
some
motivation,
but
I
had
to
learn
that
being
unwavering
and
inflexible
in
how
I
was
conveying
my
newfound
ideas
about
writing
wasn't
helping
these
students
any
more
than
it
had
helped
the
others
when
I
indirectly
told
them
it
was
OK
to
solely
write
for
a
desired
grade.
While
it
was
OK
to
tell
them
how
I
felt
about
writing,
it
was
never
OK
to
force
them
to
agree
with
me.
They
would
need
to
learn
their
own
motives
for
writing
in
their
own
time.
This
process
of
transforming
how
I
think
about
writing
did
not
stop
at
the
end
of
last
semester,
however.
Even
when
I
received
the
new
Writing
Associate
assignment
and
reviewed
what
I
had
written
for
the
assignment
last
year,
I
was
reminded
of
what
writing
for
the
wrong
reasons
can
turn
into.
As
I
flipped
through
the
pages
that
contained
my
attempt
at
last
year's
writing
assignment,
I
was
disgusted
by
the
quality
of
my
writing.
Actually,
it
was
not
so
much
the
quality
of
the
writing
that
I
was
turned
off
by.
I
actually
felt
as
though
it
was
a
well-written
paper,
but
I
could
tell
by
the
way
I
had
written
it--in
the
words
and
phrases
chosen
and
simply
in
the
preachy
tone
throughout
the
paper--that
I
had
done
so
mainly
to
impress
the
audience
who
would
be
reading
it,
not
simply
to
try
to
write
a
good
quality
paper.
This
is
something
I
struggle
with
even
now
as
I
write
this
current
paper,
but
what
concerns
me
most
as
I
look
back
at
the
previous
pages
written
is
that
I
may
be
conveying
an
idea
I
don't
wish
others
to
think
I
am
talking
about.
I
am
not
saying
one
should
not
consider
the
audience
at
all
when
one
writes.
Indeed,
one's
work
should
be
reader-based
and
not
focused
solely
within
oneself.
However,
it
is
important
to
understand
why
one
is
making
a
piece
of
work
reader-based.
If
the
answer
is
simply
because
"it
will
impress
my
audience"
or
because
"it
will
earn
me
the
grade
I
want
in
return,"
then
I
feel
as
though
the
work
is
corrupted.
If
one
can
write
sincerely
and
write
with
passion
instead
of
simply
to
get
an
A,
there
will
be
no
need
to
try
to
write
simply
to
impress
one's
audience
because
I
believe
that
it
will
happen
on
its
own.
In
this
way,
one's
work
is
still
truly
a
genuine
reflection
of
oneself,
but
it
can
most
certainly
still
be
directed
to
a
certain
audience
at
the
same
time.
The
past
year
of
WAing
as
well
as
writing
my
own
papers
has
shown
me
this
lesson
time
and
time
again.
I
am
confident
that
I
will
now
be
able
to
approach
the
upcoming
academic
year
and
responsibility
of
WAing
with
more
flexibility
and
less
desire
to
use
the
crutch
of
knowing
what
to
write
to
obtain
a
certain
grade.
I
want
the
fear
of
risk
and
of
failure
over
the
ease
of
knowing
exactly
what
to
say.
Hopefully,
work
that
is
enjoyable
to
its
readers
as
well
as
its
author
will
result
from
this
freedom.
I
might
possibly
even
run
into
some
elephants
with
water
guns
or
someone
traveling
with
computer
speakers
and
Jell-0
in
Peru
at
night.
Who
knows?
