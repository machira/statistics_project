The
NAcademicO
Research
Paper
More
than
anything
else,
in
the
past
year,
I
have
learned
to
question
my
own
understanding
of
the
nature
of
academic
writing.
I
have
come
to
understand
that
features
such
as
focusing
an
essay
around
a
thesis
statement,
writing
in
a
dispassionate
and
reserved
voice,
and
attempting
emotional
disconnection
from
the
material
at
hand
are
not
inherently
beneficial
to
writing.
Rather,
they
are
(often-desired)
attributes
that
academic
writing
can
possess,
which
allows
it
to
better
serve
its
authors
and
its
audience.
Moreover,
I
have
realized
that
there
is
no
clear-cut
process
for
effective
research
or
writing;
it
is
always
a
matter
of
refining
what
you
already
have,
regardless
of
how
incomplete
it
may
be,
or
how
polished.
The
fact
that
academic
papers
need
not
always
follow
the
same
form
was
perhaps
made
most
clear
to
me
by
a
writing
assignment
for
a
history
course
I
took
on
the
nature
of
Jewish
life
in
Poland.
In
this
assignment,
we
were
asked
by
the
professor
to
NadoptO
a
shtetl
(a
small,
predominantly
Jewish
village).
As
records
for
shtetls
are
scarce,
and
seldom
contain
much
detail,
we
were
asked
to
interpolate
based
on
accounts
of
other
shtetls,
making
the
assumption
that
there
would
have
been
distinct
parallels
or
similarities
in
our
own
shtetl.
Therefore,
we
were,
in
a
certain
sense,
creating
a
work
of
fictionNa
more
vivid
account
than
what
historical
evidence
alone
might
support.
Nevertheless,
we
strove
for
accuracy,
and
explained
(in
footnotes)
why
and
how
we
made
this
inferences.
I
decided
that
the
best
way
to
explain
the
nature
of
life
in
the
shtetl
I
chose,
Wolbrom,
was
to
write
a
narrative
in
the
form
of
a
short
story.
At
first,
I
was
intimidated,
not
having
written
much
in
the
way
of
fiction.
However,
I
realized
that
it
would
be
valuable
to
approach
it
in
much
the
same
way
writing
associates
are
asked
to
encourage
students
to
approach
writing
assignments:
attempt
to
define
my
purpose,
and
see
what
choices
in
writing
would
allow
me
to
best
accomplish
this
purpose.
Accordingly,
I
made
a
list
of
aspects
of
Wolbrom
life
that
I
wanted
my
readers
to
understand,
and
I
took
each
one,
and
decided
how
best
to
demonstrate
it,
effectively
creating
an
outline
of
the
short
story.
Curiously,
a
process
that
I
have
most
associated
with
somewhat-artificial
persuasive
writing
assignments
worked
very
well
in
this
assignment,
allowing
me
to
impose
some
structure
on
what
otherwise
might
have
been
a
daunting
assignment.
This
caused
me
to
realize
something
important:
just
because
some
types
of
writing
do
not
have
stated
theses,
clear
and
elaborate
argumentation,
and
carefully
researched
evidence,
does
not
mean
that
they
do
not
have
well-thought-out
purposes,
or
that
they
do
not
use
the
same
types
of
writing
strategies
to
accomplish
those
goals.
Perhaps
this
should
have
been
less
of
a
surprise
to
me,
given
how
much
I
had
had
to
demonstrate
this
very
same
point
to
many
students
writers
the
previous
semester.
My
partner
professor
assigned
students
an
essay
or
which
they
conducted
an
interview
of
a
veteran.
Although
most
of
the
students
were
enthusiastic
to
try
writing
this,
most
were
also
unsure
of
how
to
proceed,
having
previously
written
essays
that
were
primarily
some
combination
of
persuasive
and
expository;
this
assignment,
however,
called
for
a
more
narrative
approach.
Nevertheless,
the
first
drafts
I
received
and
read
usually
attempted
to
force
some
sort
of
argument
onto
the
story,
creating
an
awkward
and
forced
text.
After
having
discussed
this
question
with
my
partner
professor,
I
attempted
to
advise
students
that
not
focusing
their
essays
on
a
thesis
in
the
formal
sense
of
the
word.
Rather,
I
tried
to
help
them
find
a
way
to
create
a
meaningful
narrative
by
focusing
on
particular
themes
within
the
stories
that
the
veterans
had
told
them.
In
that
sense,
I
tried
to
help
them
expand
their
repertoire
to
include
an
additional
variety
of
academic
writingNone
they
had
not
likely
realized
even
existed.
Perhaps
the
other
important
thing
I
have
come
to
understand
better
is
that
it
is
difficult
to
differentiate
between
the
research
process
and
the
writing
processNindeed,
there
is
a
certain
feedback
between
the
two.
This
was
probably
best
illustrated
by
the
research
project
I
undertook
for
a
Russian
history
classNI
was
given
a
great
deal
of
freedom
as
to
the
choice
of
topic,
which
I
initially
found
daunting,
not
knowing
anything
about
the
subject
at
hand.
Having
the
whole
semester
available
to
work
on
the
project,
I
found
it
easy
to
procrastinate
for
the
first
two
weeks,
rather
than
figuring
out
how
to
proceed.
Eventually,
what
I
concluded
is
that
I
needed
to
try
putting
together
an
outline
based
on
what
I
did
already
know,
and
see
what
research
made
sense
from
that
point.
At
this
early
juncture,
I
was
mainly
able
to
rule
out
possible
ideas
of
topics
to
research.
Accordingly,
I
initially
found
that
the
books
and
articles
I
was
reading
were
mostly
uninteresting
and
irrelevant.
This
frustrated
me,
to
say
the
least,
especially
given
how
long
it
took
to
find
additional
resources
after
this.
However,
as
I
continued
to
work,
I
found
that
I
was
able
to
find
increasingly
useful
sources,
as
I
began
to
be
more
familiar
with
a
number
of
important
areas
of
knowledge.
First,
I
became
more
familiar
with
where
research
that
had
been
done
previously
had
been
focused.
This
both
allowed
me
to
determine
what
research
I
might
be
able
to
find,
as
well
as
to
have
some
intuition
into
what
areas
might
merit
further
explanation.
Second,
I
became
familiar
with
the
terms
used
in
the
research,
allowing
me
to
better
locate
additional
research
in
catalogs
and
databases,
as
well
as
to
better
understand
those
that
I
did
find.
Finally,
I
was
able
to
locate
a
greater
number
of
locations
I
could
find
information
about
my
topic,
making
it
easier
to
find
obscure
research.
The
key
point
about
all
of
this,
however,
is
that
the
way
I
gained
this
information
was
iterative:
that
is
to
say,
it
was
only
through
outlining
what
information
I
had
already
found
that
I
was
able
to
see
the
commonalities
that
allowed
me
to
proceed.
Merely
collecting
the
research
was
not
sufficient,
nor
was
taking
notes
on
sourcesNactively
attempting
to
piece
together
the
writing,
even
when
I
knew
I
would
revise
(and
probably
fully
replace)
all
of
it
was
the
only
way
I
was
able
to
come
to
a
better
understanding
of
my
research
subject.
It
is
perhaps
unfortunate
that
I
did
not
realize
this
until
after
this
year,
as
I
now
see
in
retrospect
that
many
of
the
student
writers
I
worked
with
had
also
not
come
to
understand
this.
In
particular,
most
seemed
to
view
research
primarily
as
an
effort
to
collect
relevant
sources,
and
then
locating
within
these
pieces
of
information
that
would
help
support
the
argument
they
were
making.
This
may
have
been
somewhat
effective,
but
it
often
meant
that
there
were
additional
connections
they
made
almost
immediately
before
turning
the
assignment.
This
was
not
inherently
problematic,
but
it
often
meant
that
these
student
writers
did
not
have
the
time
to
explore
other
avenues
of
research
that
might
have
improved
their
papers,
as
they
did
not
attempt
to
piece
together
the
evidence
they
did
have
until
too
late
in
the
process
of
composing
the
paper.
This
was
(perhaps
ironically)
particularly
true
of
a
paper
about
which
I
held
two
rounds
of
conferencesNI
had
agreed
with
my
partner
professor
that
the
best
plan
was
to
discuss
only
research,
and
not
the
written
paper
itself,
on
the
first
meeting.
Therefore,
we
agreed
that
students
would
bring
in
a
brief
outline
of
their
argument,
as
well
as
a
working
bibliography,
so
they
we
could
discuss
what
further
research
might
be
appropriate.
Unfortunately,
this
resulted
in
most
students
not
having
actually
read
the
sources
they
had
collectedNthey
instead
mainly
assumed
what
they
would
contain,
and
how
those
would
pertain
to
the
paper.
As
a
result,
I
accomplished
less
in
these
conferences
than
I
had
hoped
to,
as
the
student
writers,
while
having
found
many
sources,
had
not
yet
learned
anything
from
themNaccordingly,
they
did
not
have
sufficient
background
knowledge
of
their
subject
either
to
be
able
to
discuss
what
about
it
they
wanted
to
focus
on,
or
to
be
able
to
address
possible
shortcomings
in
their
research.
Thus,
when
I
met
with
the
students
for
a
second
time,
I
found
that,
instead
of
talking
about
issues
around
the
composition
of
their
papers,
I
needed
to
focus
on
concerns
I
had
hoped
to
address
in
the
first
round
of
conferences.
While
this
was,
I
hope,
helpful
to
the
student
writers,
it
did
mean
that
I
had
far
less
time
to
spend
on
compositional
questions,
and
I
fear
that
their
papers
may
have
suffered
as
a
result.
In
the
future,
therefore,
I
would
prefer
having
a
first-round
conference
that
focused
less
on
argument,
less
on
breadth
of
sources,
and
more
on
that
actual
content
of
the
sources
the
student
writers
had
already
read.
What
student
writers
might
prepare
for
such
a
conference
would
probably
take
the
form
of
something
like
an
annotated
bibliography,
but
with
a
focus
on
the
information
in
each
source.
It
strikes
me
as
ironic
that,
in
order
to
promote
critical
thinking
and
writing
in
student
writers,
I
am
proposing
that
they
be
required
to
summarize.
But
I
think
that
it
is
what
is
necessary
in
this
particular
case:
the
problem
is
not
that
students
learning
college
writing
are
incapable
of
summarizing
well.
On
the
contrary,
I
suspect
they
are
so
confident
in
these
abilities
that
they
are
willing
to
put
off
doing
so
until
soon
before
a
paper
must
be
completed.
The
problem
is
that
the
critical
skills
we
as
writing
associates
aim
to
help
student
writers
develop
are
crucially
based
in
the
non-critical
tasks
of
comprehension
and
summarization;
non-critical
and
critical
tasks
are
intertwined
in
a
way
that
makes
completing
the
latter
impossible
without
considering
the
former.
Accordingly,
since
this
point
seems
unclear
to
many
student
writers
(and,
indeed,
was
until
recently
to
me),
there
may
need
to
be
more
guidance
to
students:
assigning
the
NcollectingO
of
sources
separately
from
the
evaluation
thereof
might
clarify
to
students
that
both
tasks
are
important,
but,
more
importantly,
that,
in
college
writing,
both
must
be
done.
Moreover,
creating
a
multi-step
process
may
reinforce
the
idea
that
writing,
at
its
heart,
is
a
process
for
creating
knowledge,
not
merely
generating
papers.
The
crucial
component
in
all
of
this,
of
course,
is
also
making
clear
that
both
collecting
sources
and
evaluating
them
are
iterative
processes,
and
that
both
draw
on
each
other.
This,
I
fear,
is
something
that
can
probably
only
be
understood
through
experience.
Nevertheless,
we
should
try
to
allow
students
to
learn
this
for
themselves
as
early
as
possible
in
their
writing
careers.
Still,
I
think
this
points
to
a
need
to
better
explain
to
students
what
it
is
that
we
(and,
more
centrally,
our
partner
professors)
want
students
writers
to
learn
in
their
courses,
not
only
topically,
but
in
terms
of
writing
skills.
Indeed,
one
of
the
things
that
helped
me
the
most
was
the
explanation
that
accompanied
my
Wolbrom
paperNit
not
only
explained
what
a
good
research
process
would
be
and
what
resources
were
available,
but
what,
in
terms
of
writing
skills
we
might
be
able
to
learn.
Additionally,
and
importantly,
my
professor
had
us
discuss
our
progress
with
our
papers
often,
even
though
we
had
nearly
a
month
to
complete
the
assignment.
Besides
the
professor
offering
advice,
discussing
our
work
with
the
class
meant
that
we
were
able
to
benefit
from
what
other
people
had
learned.
On
a
more
cynical
note,
it
gave
us
some
external
motivation
to
continue
working
and
not
putting
of
the
projectNwhich
turned
out
to
be
extremely
important,
given
the
numerous
problems
many
of
us
ran
into
with
our
projects.
Notably,
we
were
not
graded
on
these
intermediate
stepsNI
think
that
may
have
cheapened
the
exercise,
and
made
us
more
likely
to
attempt
to
overstate
what
research
we
had
done.
Rather,
the
act
that
we
were
responsible
to
our
peers
seems
to
have
motivated
us
to
take
the
assignment
seriously.
In
sum,
what
I
think
has
become
clear
to
me
is
that,
when
it
comes
to
writing,
it
is
oten
not
the
act
of
composing
papers
that
students
(if
particularly
advanced
students)
struggle
with,
but
rather
the
process
of
creating
the
paper,
broadly
defined,
from
choosing
a
topic,
to
researching
sources,
to
organizing
the
argument,
to
understanding
the
rhetorical
devices
best
suited
to
their
purpose.
What
we,
as
writing
associates,
ought
to
try
to
do,
is
guide
students
through
that
process,
and
facilitate
our
partner
professors
doing
the
same
thing.
