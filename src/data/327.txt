Writing
Associate
Workshop
Project
My
history
as
a
writer
over
the
last
year,
particularly
the
second
semester,
not
only
includes
my
experiences
as
a
writer;
it
also
entails
that
which
I
encounter
in
my
writing
conferences
with
my
students.
I
have
learned
much
over
the
course
of
my
junior
year,
both
from
my
own
courses
and
from
the
one-on-one
interactions
I
have
had
with
the
students
in
the
classes
I
have
been
a
Writing
Associate
for
and
the
laboratory
sections
for
which
I
have
been
a
Psychology
Teaching
Assistant.
The
problems
I
have
stumbled
upon
and
rewards
I
have
received
thereafter
have
contributed
to
my
journey
as
both
a
reader
and
a
writer.
I
never
thought
that
picking
up
foreign
language
again
would
be
such
a
learning
experience.
I
felt
like
I
was
in
elementary
school
again
in
my
attempt
to
remember
the
various
rules
and
regulations
of
a
language.
I
almost
wished,
at
times,
that
there
was
a
St.
Martin's
Handbook
for
Spanish,
and
indeed,
I
must
have
committed
the
twenty
most
common
surface
errors
of
Spanish
on
a
weekly
basis.
Although
I
had
taken
Spanish
in
high
school,
the
Lafayette
foreign
language
department
obviously
moves
much
more
quickly
than
my
high
school
instructors,
and
by
the
end
of
the
first
five
weeks,
everything
I
had
learned
in
three
years
of
high
school
Spanish
was
reviewed.
I
had
to
write
compositions
of
approximately
250
words,
which
in
English
would
have
taken
no
time.
I
felt,
in
some
ways,
like
students
in
the
First-Year
Seminars
I
have
WA-ed
;
I
was
not
sure
where
to
begin
at
first,
but
with
some
assistance
and
practice,
I
got
accustomed
to
reading,
writing,
and
speaking
in
the
jargon
that
was
appropriate
for
this
course.
Another
course
I
took
in
the
spring
semester
was
Social
Psychology.
This
class
was
one
of
the
most
informative
courses
I
have
taken
thus
far
because
everything
we
learned
in
class
was
applicable
to
the
real
world.
Response
papers,
which
in
this
course
ranged
from
topics
of
alcohol
myopia
to
the
ethical
treatment
of
human
participants,
are
common
for
many
classes,
and
they
involved
the
usual
summarizing
of
articles
and
explaining
how
they
relate
to
the
current
coursework
at
hand.
There
were
two
longer
papers
assigned,
and
they
were
slightly
unlike
other
papers
I
have
completed
in
the
past.
No
research
was
involved!
The
first
assignment
required
each
student
to
break
a
social
norm
and
write
about
the
experience
and
how
the
reactions
received
were
exemplary
of
social
psychology
and
the
theories
I
had
learned
in
the
first
half
of
the
semester.
Writing
the
six-page
paper
was
not
the
problem;
the
problem
was
thinking
of
a
social
norm
that
I
was
comfortable
breaking.
Finally,
I
decided
to
wear
a
prom
gown
to
the
grocery
store
one
day,
and
I
was
off
to
writing
am
A
paper.
The
second
assignment
involved
observing
television
programs
and
writing
about
how
the
media
relates
to
social
psychological
theories
in
daily
life.
For
example,
women
often
compare
themselves
to
women
they
see
on
television,
and
therefore,
they
feel
the
need
to
be
slender
and
flawless
(social
comparison
theory).
Although
this
assignment
does
not
seem
very
difficult,
it
may
be
a
problem
for
someone
who
barely
watches
television.
Both
of
the
assignments
I
received
in
Social
Psychology
class
forced
me
to
write
in
a
way
that
was,
at
least
in
my
experience,
not
traditional
for
a
college
course.
Rather
than
researching
a
topic,
I
was
encouraged
to
expand
the
realm
in
which
I
tend
to
write
and
draw
from
my
own
experiences
and
observations
within
society.
This
spring
must
have
been
a
semester
of
atypical
coursework.
I
was
enrolled
in
Sex
and
Gender:
A
Cross-Cultural
View,
which
was
an
Anthropology
and
Sociology
Writing
class.
Unfortunately,
it
was
taught
by
an
awful
adjunct
who
was
finishing
up
her
Masters'
Thesis,
and
although
her
stories
of
her
travels
to
Africa
and
the
Middle
East
were
interesting,
her
class
was
uneventful
to
say
the
least.
However,
her
major
writing
assignments,
similar
to
that
of
Professor
Shaw,
did
not
involve
research--
she
too
expected
her
students
to
observe
society
and
connect
what
they
saw
with
readings
and
lectures
from
the
course.
My
first
assignment
entailed
locating
magazine
advertisements
and
writing
at
least
ten
pages
about
how
they
all
fulfilled
a
specific
gender
stereotype.
I
found
this
experience
to
be
quite
disheartening;
each
magazine
I
perused
had
a
multitude
of
ads
that
showed
women
in
roles
that
were
either
domestic
or
subservient
to
men.
I
was
disappointed
that
I
had
so
much
to
write
about.
Professor
Montgomery-Rhinehart'
s
other
assignment
required
the
class,
as
she
called
it,
to
write
like
anthropologists.
As
a
psychology
major,
it
took
several
drafts
in
order
to
convince
her
that
my
writing
was
truly
anthropological.
This
paper
included
working
with
a
partner,
which
is
something
else
I
was
not
accustomed
to.
I
thoroughly
enjoy
working
independently,
so
writing
a
ten-page
paper
with
another
person
(even
if
she
was
a
sorority
sister)
for
an
anthropological
audience
certainly
seemed
to
provide
an
outlet
for
a
minor
case
of
academic
misery.
Observing
individuals
in
two
different
settings
that
were
similar,
yet
different
enough
to
compare
and
watching
out
for
the
different
ways
in
which
males
interacted
with
males,
females
with
females,
and
males
with
females
did
not
seem
like
an
enticing
task;
I
felt
our
findings
were
going
to
be
quite
obvious,
and
in
all
honestly,
I
do
enjoy
writing
for
the
purpose
of
learning,
but
not
as
a
means
of
completing
the
twenty-page
requirement
that
is
necessary
for
a
course
to
be
designated
a
[W].
Although
there
were
few
opportunities
for
research
in
these
three
courses,
the
first
semester
of
Thesis
more
than
compensated
for
it.
I
had
never
encountered
an
academic
experience
that
was
both
difficult
and
frustrating,
yet
simultaneously
rewarding.
Every
adjective
and
question
stated
in
the
Writing
Like
A
WA
project
description
accurately
illustrates
my
Thesis
experience--
yes,
I
did
establish
a
writing
identity
that
involved
a
different
writing
process,
and
I
did
encounter
obstacles,
new
expectations
from
different
audiences,
and
certainly
new
research
methodologies
and
theories.
Perhaps,
more
than
anything,
I
developed
new
expectations
of
my
own.
As
I
read
the
third
paragraph
of
the
assignment
for
returning
writing
associates,
the
dreaded,
yet
exhilarating,
word
THESIS
resounded
repeatedly
in
my
mind.
During
the
first
few
weeks
of
the
semester,
I
met
with
my
thesis
advisor
on
a
weekly
basis
to
discuss
my
progress,
new
ideas,
and
possible
obstacles.
Approximately
half
way
through
the
semester,
I
was
instructed
that
I
had
to
start
writing;
it
was
time
to
start
constructing
in
writing
the
research
I
had
accumulated
and
delved
into
over
the
past
six
or
seven
weeks.
I
sat
at
my
computer
to
write,
and
I
never
remembered
feeling
such
anxiety
over
writing
before,
except
for
while
I
was
a
student
in
Professor
Schneiderman's
First-Year
Seminar.
I
handed
in
five
pages
a
few
days
later,
and
when
I
met
with
my
advisor,
I
never
saw
so
many
red
markings
in
such
a
small
space.
I
was
surprised
because
the
level
of
writing
that
I
had
turned
in
was
equivalent
to
that
which
had
earned
me
multiple
A's
with
this
professor
in
the
past.
He
explained
that
it
was
not
Thesis
appropriate
writing,
and
he
wanted
those
five
pages
revised
with
at
least
another
ten
pages
added
to
it
by
our
next
meeting.
He
also
went
on
to
tell
me
that
I
wasn't
sticking
to
my
topic...
the
famous
dreaded
WA
phrase--
I
had
become
one
of
my
students.
The
inexperienced
writer
who
Linda
Flower
talks
about
in
Inventing
the
University
was
me!
I
was
unable
to
compose
reader-based
prose
(p.
446);
I
knew
what
I
wanted
to
write,
but
I
could
not
write
as
if
I
was
writing
for
a
psychological
scholarly
journal.
After
submitting
my
second
attempt,
I
saw
even
more
red
ink,
even
on
the
sections
that
I
had
revised
according
to
how
my
advisor
asked.
I
walked
out
of
my
advisor's
office,
and
slowly,
the
tears
began
to
trickle
down
my
frustrated
face.
I
was
not
used
to
having
my
writing
criticized
so
harshly,
and
the
first
thing
that
came
to
mind
was,
DO
I
MAKE
MY
STUDENTS
FEEL
THIS
WAY?
I
assured
myself
that
I
am
not
that
tough
on
my
students
because
I
actually
received
evaluations
the
prior
semester
for
being
too
nice
and
not
critical
enough.
The
next
few
weeks
were
overwhelming.
I
sent
multiple
e-mail
attachments
at
3:00
A.M.,
left
various
hard
copies
of
drafts
with
the
psychology
department
secretary
at
4:55,
and
spent
hours
upon
hours
revising
my
thesis.
I
even
had
a
separate
disk
for
this
endeavor,
and
I
began
naming
each
revision
Thesis
Attempt__
as
I
began
to
number
my
efforts.
I
believe
the
final
draft
was
Thesis
Attempt
15
or
so.
However,
after
completing
and
passing
my
hour
and
a
half-long
defense,
I
felt
so
proud
to
be
granted
permission
to
do
this
again
for
the
upcoming
semester!
Perhaps
writing
an
Honors
Thesis
has
given
me
a
new
perspective
on
writing
conferences.
Of
course,
I
will
still
have
students
in
the
classes
I
work
with
read
passages
aloud,
even
though
as
Bartholomae
points
out
in
The
Study
of
Error
,
students
often
read
what
they
intended
to
say
rather
than
what
is
on
paper
in
front
of
them.
I
really
do
believe
that
this
is
helpful
if
the
students
realize
that
they
should
not
write
in
the
same
way
that
they
speak.
I
refuse
to
be
as
harsh
as
my
advisor
was
with
me,
because
in
all
reality,
there
is
no
need
for
it--
I
am
only
the
Writing
Associate!
However,
I
intend
to
challenge
my
students
in
that
I
am
going
to
strive
to
have
them
truly
understand
what
they
are
writing
instead
of
simply
regurgitating
the
material
they
have
researched.
I
encourage
new
Writing
Associates
to
question
the
professor
they
are
working
with
as
much
as
possible
in
regards
to
their
expectations
of
both
themselves
and
the
students
enrolled
in
the
course.
Moreover,
all
Writing
Associates
must
recall
that
each
writer
we
work
with
does
have
a
past,
both
as
an
individual
and
a
writer,
and
in
order
to
be
successful
in
helping
first-year
students
especially,
we
must
probe
our
students'
minds
to
discover
that
history
and
use
it
to
benefit
the
draft
at
hand.
