Class
of
2005
A
person
never
knows
what
they
are
truly
thinking
until
they
write
it
down.
Perhaps
the
most
valuable
writing
lesson
that
I
have
learned,
the
aforementioned
expression
is
a
great
way
to
remind
oneself
that
what
we
think
in
our
head
is
not
always
what
appears
on
paper.
A
key
aspect
of
good
writing
comes
from
the
ability
to
effectively
organize
our
thoughts.
Organizational
skills,
however,
are
not
an
innate
human
quality.
They
are
a
learned
behavior
that
takes
practice.
While
many
students
know
that
rewrites
are
an
essential
part
of
essay
writing,
many
do
not
realize
that
brainstorming
and
free
writing
can
also
be
useful
tools.
While
there
is
no
universal
formula
for
good
writing,
an
individual
can
build
his
or
her
own
unique
method.
Personally,
my
formula
has
been
derived
from
the
way
in
which
I
learned
writing
techniques
over
the
course
of
my
education.
My
first
memory
that
involves
writing
comes
in
the
form
of
shapes
and
colors,
rather
than
the
alphabet.
As
a
child,
I
used
my
drawings
to
depict
stories.
Though
at
first
glance,
my
drawings
may
have
made
little
sense
to
others,
within
each
picture
there
was
an
immensely
detailed
story.
It
was
with
these
first
drawings
that
I
would
retell
a
story
to
my
mother,
or
sisters,
using
each
color
and
line
in
the
picture
to
describe
my
tale.
My
mother
used
to
joke
that
a
drawing
of
one
stick
figured
person
would
have
hours
and
hours
of
story
behind
it.
Needless
to
say,
I
had
a
large
imagination.
My
first
use
of
letters
and
numbers,
however,
came
in
Kindergarten,
where
teachers
would
ask
students
questions
about
their
favorite
birthday
party
or
holiday,
and
then
the
teacher
would
write
down
everything
the
student
said.
The
kindergartener
would
then
draw
a
picture
next
to
the
text,
about
what
he
or
she
had
just
told
the
teacher.
Eventually,
these
pictures
and
texts
would
be
bound
together
to
form
a
makeshift
book.
Using
this
same
idea,
teachers
in
older
grades
would
have
students
write
down
their
favorite
holiday
or
birthday.
What
began
as
a
sense
of
storytelling
through
pictures
led
to
a
recounting
of
events
through
paper
medium.
Thus,
I
was
first
taught
to
orally
express
my
thoughts,
then
to
record
my
recounting
of
events
onto
paper.
By
the
time
I
was
in
6th
grade,
I
was
taught
the
meaning
of
free
writing;
a
task
that
I
found
annoying
back
then,
but
cherish
now
as
a
key
tool
in
deciphering
my
own
thoughts.
Free
writing
is
a
method
used
by
many
middle
school
teachers
as
a
way
of
helping
students
put
ideas
onto
paper
without
the
boundaries
of
organization,
punctuation,
or
proper
grammatical
structures.
A
student
is
allowed
to
write
about
anything
her
or
she
wants
for
a
set
amount
of
time,
in
any
way
in
which
he
or
she
desires.
The
only
rule
is
that
the
student
is
not
allowed
to
stop
writing
until
the
free
writing
time
is
up.
Thus,
students
must
constantly
be
writing
throughout
the
exercise.
The
beauty
of
free
writing
is
that
it
affords
a
student
the
ability
to
record
his
or
her
thoughts
without
the
structural
binds
of
grammar,
punctuation,
and
the
like.
Because
many
students
try
to
put
their
thoughts
onto
paper
in
the
proper
grammatical
and
structural
manner,
many
of
their
ideas
can
be
lost
if
they
do
not
know
how
to
grammatically
fit
an
idea
into
a
sentence.
It
falls
under
the
same
principle
that
a
person
may
know
what
he
or
she
is
feeling,
but
doesnOt
know
how
to
express
that
emotion.
Free
writing
is
a
way
in
which
students
can
strip
themselves
of
formal
boundaries,
and
record
thoughts
on
paper
in
their
most
basic
form.
In
the
beginning
of
my
eighth
grade
year,
I
struggled
with
my
writing.
All
of
my
life,
my
writing
had
been
commended
by
teachers
and
family.
In
eighth
grade,
however,
my
English
grades
were
slipping.
Though
I
was
happy
with
the
flow
and
topic
of
the
essays
that
I
turned
in,
my
teacher
was
not.
She
stressed
the
necessity
of
rewriting
our
essays,
and
rewarded
those
students
who
were
able
to
effectively
rewrite
whole
pages
of
their
essays,
without
changing
its
topic
or
flow.
Though
at
the
time
I
loathed
her
for
what
I
thought
to
be
busy
work,
I
later
realized,
and
eventually
appreciated,
her
purpose.
She
wanted
her
students
to
realize
that
no
writing
is
ever
set
in
stone.
The
same
event
can
be
recounted
a
hundred
different
ways
and
still
be
just
as
effective.
More
importantly,
she
taught
me
that
I
should
never
fall
in
love,
or
be
satisfied,
with
a
first
draft
because
I
can
always
do
better
on
the
next
revision.
Though
in
the
beginning
of
my
eighth
grade
year
I
struggled
with
my
writing
style,
by
the
end
of
that
same
year,
I
had
once
again
come
into
my
own
voice.
That
year
was
by
far
the
most
important
year
in
my
writing
evolution,
as
it
taught
me
the
most
painful
truth:
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
perfect
paper.
By
my
sophomore
year
in
high
school
I
was
quite
confident
in
my
writing
capabilities.
I
was
receiving
a
great
deal
of
praise
by
my
professors
for
my
writing
style,
and
I
was
convinced
that
I
had
finally
mastered
the
art
of
paper
writing.
However
in
May
of
my
freshman
year
I
had
been
accepted
into
a
special
program
at
my
high
school
which
used
a
more
hands
on
approach
to
learning.
I
was
to
be
one
of
twenty
four
students
who
took
part
in
the
program
for
my
sophomore
and
junior
years
in
high
school.
In
applying
I
knew
that
it
was
going
to
involve
a
great
deal
of
writing,
but
I
did
not
realize
that
the
audience
for
whom
I
was
writing
was
not
only
going
to
be
my
teachers,
but
was
also
going
to
include
my
peers.
The
program
enabled
students
to
use
the
world-wide
web
to
accomplish
everything
from
finding
out
homework
assignments
through
e-mail
from
their
teachers,
to
creating
individual
homepages
on
which
our
class
work
would
be
published.
Our
class
had
its
own
homepage
on
a
string
of
academic
sites
on
which
all
twenty-four
of
us
would
post
everything
from
our
essays
to
our
homework
assignments.
Thus,
my
audience
base
jumped
from
a
close
knit
circle
of
my
private
school
teachers
to
countless
web
browsers
world
wide!
Also
on
the
site,
our
e-mail
addresses
were
posted,
so
that
readers
could
e-mail
us
their
comments
and
criticisms
about
our
writing.
We
used
the
websites
mainly
for
purposes
of
peer
editing,
but
occasionally
we
would
receive
e-mails
from
people
online
who
had
read
our
postings.
Aside
from
the
fact
that
my
fear
of
criticism
had
immensely
multiplied,
I
began
to
realize
that
my
writing
style
was
going
to
have
to
change
due
to
the
broader
nature
of
my
audience
base.
While
I
had
grown
accustomed
to
using
a
more
formal
tone
in
most
of
my
essays,
I
now
had
to
worry
about
what
type
of
writing
tone
I
would
use
to
address
not
only
my
peers,
but
also
the
vast
array
of
audiences
that
may
be
perusing
my
work
over
the
world-wide
web!
Though
at
first
I
struggled
back
and
forth
between
writing
papers
that
were
either
too
formal
or
too
informal,
eventually,
I
found
that
there
is
a
happy
median
between
the
two
that
can
be
used
to
address
audiences
of
various
backgrounds.
Though
learning
to
change
my
writing
style
according
to
my
audience
base
proved
to
be
a
valuable
lesson,
the
most
rewarding
experience
was
the
dialogue
that
occurred
between
my
peers
and
I
as
a
result
of
our
ability
to
easily
access
each
othersO
work.
Hearing
comments
and
criticisms
from
my
peers
was,
at
first,
a
bit
more
difficult
than
hearing
those
of
my
teachers.
I
expected
criticisms
from
teachers,
but
from
my
fellow
classmates
I
was
confounded
that
they
would
dissect
my
work
with
as
much
ease
as
they
did.
However
once
I
accepted
their
critiques
as
helpful
comments,
and
not
malicious
remarks,
I
began
to
appreciate
and
even
welcome
criticism.
I
found
that
criticism
was
much
more
helpful
than
praise,
when
it
came
to
my
writing
style.
It
forced
me
to
begin
analyzing
my
work
from
the
perspective
of
my
peers.
When
sitting
down
to
write
an
essay
or
an
analysis,
I
started
looking
at
research
projects
and
even
creative
writing
assignments
from
the
point
of
view
of
my
reader,
and
not
just
myself.
Though
I
liked
to
write
long,
thesaurus-boosted
sentences,
peer
editing
forced
me
to
realize
that
shorter
sentences
are
many
times
just
as
effective,
if
not
more.
The
final
key
to
the
programOs
peer
editing
curriculum
was
an
open
forum,
in
which
we
discussed
the
final
draft
of
our
peersO
works.
Many
times
we
would
be
asked
to
read
a
classmatesO
essay,
so
that
the
author
could
hear
his
or
her
writing
from
the
perspective
of
their
audience
base.
Learning
to
be
both
author
and
audience
is
something
I
still
struggle
with
today.
However
I
find
that
forcing
myself
to
do
so
is
a
great
writing
tool
because
not
only
does
it
allow
the
author
to
view
their
work
from
their
audienceOs
perspective,
but
more
importantly,
it
subconsciously
compels
the
author
to
add
another
level
of
scrutiny
to
his
or
her
writing.
In
writing,
there
is
always
room
for
improvement.
From
my
senior
year
in
high
school
to
the
present,
I
have
experienced
many
more
approaches
to
writing.
In
my
high
school
Advanced
Placement
classes,
I
was
taught
how
to
write
quickly,
yet
effectively
while
in
a
timed
environment.
In
a
Constitutional
Law
class
that
I
took
freshman
year
while
attending
American
University,
I
was
taught
how
to
write
legal
briefs,
as
well
as
how
to
format
research
papers
on
legal
documents
and
court
cases.
During
my
first
semester
of
college,
I
took
a
college
writing
course
with
a
Professor
whose
goal
was
to
dispel
all
of
the
myths
and
outdated
rules
for
sentence
structure,
grammar,
and
writing
style.
He
focused
on
dispelling
the
idea
that
sentences
could
not
start
out
with
but
or
and,
and
required
his
students
to
use
sentences
beginning
with
those
words
at
least
two
times
on
every
page
of
their
writing
assignments.
I
was
also
taught
to
use
short
yet
effective
sentences
at
the
beginning
of
every
indent,
in
an
effort
to
easily
draw
the
reader
in
to
the
purpose
of
each
new
paragraph.
While
I
do
not
agree
with
all
that
he
taught,
I
do
agree
with
this
professor
that
many
rules
for
writing
are
outdated
and
too
rigid
for
modern
forms
of
writing.
Where
I
differ
in
opinion
from
the
professor
is
in
that
I
believe
that
breaking
the
rules
of
writing
should
be
done
on
an
individual
basis,
and
should
only
be
done
if
it
is
necessary
for
the
effectiveness
of
a
sentence
or
paragraph.
Many
teachers
and
professors
of
the
years
have
taught
their
opinions
on
the
rules
for
different
types
of
writing.
Their
opinions,
however,
have
many
times
clashed
and
I
have
finally
come
to
the
conclusion
that
writing
technique
and
style
should
be
assessed
on
a
personal
basis
for
most
types
of
writing.
Writing
should
be
a
comfortable
process.
The
more
at
ease
the
author
is
with
his
or
her
work,
the
better
the
writing
quality
because
there
is
more
than
just
information
that
can
be
read
from
a
personOs
writing
style.
Too
many
short
and
choppy
sentences
can
signify
that
the
authorOs
thoughts
may
not
have
been
collected
and
organized
while
writing.
Likewise,
other
styles
can
send
messages
to
the
reader
about
the
authorOs
state
of
mind
while
he
or
she
was
writing.
That
is
why
it
is
important
that
writing
is
a
comfortable
and
enjoyable
process.
Moreover,
in
my
opinion,
style
and
technique
should
be
assessed
on
a
personal
basis.
I
have
learned
over
the
years
that
while
it
is
important
to
try
using
different
writing
styles
that
professors
have
stressed,
when
it
comes
down
to
it,
personal
preference
in
writing
style
always
proves
to
be
the
most
effective.
Regardless
the
style
used,
there
is
always
room
for
improvement
when
it
comes
to
writing,
no
paper
is
perfect,
and
no
method
is
flawless.
That
is
the
beauty
of
the
evolution
of
reflecting
on
my
personal
writing
history
D
the
more
I
write,
the
better
my
writing
becomes.
