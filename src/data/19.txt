WA
Paper
Thinking
back,
he
says,
it's
hard
for
me
to
remember
particularly
well
any
of
my
early
writing
experiences.
A
few
random
ones
emerge
from
the
jumble
of
ideas
that
are
rolling
through
his
head.
However,
we
are
supposed
to
give
our
life
history
as
a
writer,
so
it's
probably
best
to
begin
with
the
birth
of
his
writing
life
and
work
towards
the
present.
I
don't
believe
that
he
did
much
writing
when
he
was
a
little
guy.
Actually,
that
may
or
may
not
be
true,
since
he
does
not
remember
doing
any
writing
at
a
young
age,
regardless
of
whether
he
did
or
not.
One
particular
thought
that
sticks
in
his
mind
is
in
regard
to
the
period
of
time
where
he
was
sentenced
to
Catholic
school.
During
this
period,
the
artist
entered
his
blue
phase.
Unlike
Picasso,
this
period
did
not
center
around
various
shades
of
blue
paint
splashed
onto
a
canvas,
but
rather
the
subject's
psychological
mindset.
The
subject
did
not
particularly
enjoy
his
confinement
in
such
carefully
restricted
quarters.
He
responded
to
this
by
beginning
to
write,
to
express
his
feelings
of
resentment
and
anger.
Abysmal
experimental
poetry
came
first.
The
emphasis
lay
more
on
rhyme
than
on
content.
The
focus
was
directed
more
towards
imitating
previously
discovered
thoughts
and
forms,
rather
than
turning
inward
and
examining
his
soul.
These
first
horrid
attempts
at
written
self-expression
were
called
by
the
names
of
Day
of
Spring
and
Toys.
These
simplistic
titles
implied
a
total
lack
of
content.
And
that
is
what
these
works
suffered
from.
The
writer
had
much
to
learn
as
he
grew
and
matured.
Following
this
brief
flirtation
with
creativity,
he
momentarily
emerged
from
his
shell
to
author
a
number
of
different
pieces.
These
were
from
a
wide
variety
of
interesting
exercises
that
centered
on
the
completion
of
a
storyline.
They
were
mimeographed
pages
that
came
from
a
book
filled
with
short
paragraphs
followed
by
blank
lines.
The
young
writer
was
also
given
a
picture
depicted
some
item
of
interest
to
the
story.
One
particularly
memorable
one
involved
an
abominable
snowman
who
was
attacking
a
group
of
skiers,
including
the
writer.
This
story
was
accompanied
by
a
horrifying
picture,
meant
to
strike
fear
into
the
hearts
of
little
children.
Most
just
found
it
mildly
amusing.
At
any
rate,
the
story
was
concluded
by
the
writer
by
having
Batman
coming
flying
to
the
rescue
on
a
flying
reindeer.
Although
completely
absurd,
our
young
hero
found
that
he
did
not
lack
for
a
creative
impulse,
merely
the
means
of
effectively
expressing
it.
More
practice
and
development
was
required.
His
next
attempts
occurred
with
the
collaboration
of
a
catholic
school
friend.
This
time
the
model
was
the
famed
Choose-Your-Own-Adventure
books
that
many
young
boys
our
age
had
read.
These
books
allowed
one
to
follow
his/her
own
path
through
the
story.
The
two
foolish
young
co-conspirators
decided
that
the
could
do
better
than
what
was
currently
available
on
the
library
bookshelves.
For
these
books,
all
of
the
writing
and
artistry
was
done
by
the
subject
and
his
friend.
In
this
particular
venture,
the
most
important
aspect
came
to
be
the
presentation.
The
friend
attempted
to
use
calligraphy
to
write
the
story.
However,
this
came
after
the
hours
of
intense
debate
and
discussion
over
appropriate
storylines
while
watching
G.I.
Joe
on
the
afternoon
cartoons.
It
was
no
coincidence
that
many
of
the
stories
bore
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
cartoon
fare
playing
in
the
background.
Eventually
the
interest
in
writing
these
stories
waned
in
favor
of
more
elaborate
ventures,
and
the
two
partners
went
their
separate
ways.
The
next
step
for
the
writer
was
a
huge
report
on
the
state
of
California.
Rather
than
advance
to
the
next
step
in
technological
advancement,
the
typewriter,
the
young
fourth
grader
decided
to
stick
to
his
longhand.
Although
the
report
was
very
broad
and
informative,
it
had
very
little
direction
to
it.
Of
course
Mrs.
Pope
(ironic
name
for
a
catholic
school
teacher?)
was
not
on
the
literary
council
for
the
Newbery
or
Nobel
prize
committees
so
this
did
not
yield
any
negative
affects
for
the
young
protagonist.
However,
it
is
very
indicative
of
other
things.
At
this
point
in
his
life,
the
writer
was
feeling
extremely
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
world.
He
was
unhappy
with
his
schooling
and
found
it
both
extremely
boring
and
only
mildly
challenging.
Therefore
he
sought
his
own
challenges
by
wandering
between
as
many
different
areas
of
interest
as
possible.
He
also
read
even
more
voraciously
than
he
had
previously.
Due
to
the
feelings
of
isolation
he
felt,
he
began
to
find
familiarity
and
solace
in
the
readings
of
others.
From
this
starting
point,
he
began
to
move
towards
his
own
style
of
writing.
Inevitably,
he
imitated
his
most
currently
read
author,
ranging
from
Mark
Twain
to
Herman
Wouk,
Melville
to
Hawthore,
and
Austen
to
Shelley.
He
tended
towards
fantasy
and
science
fiction
writing,
since
it
admitted
him
to
an
imaginary
world
that
was
not
his
own.
While
in
this
world,
he
imitated
such
tales
as
the
Chronicles
of
Narnia/Lion
in
the
Wardrobe
series.
Battles
were
fought
between
the
forces
of
good
and
evil.
Heroes
and
villains
rose
up
and
were
crushed.
Tolkein
and
The
Hobbit
became
great
influences
on
his
writing.
Upon
reaching
sixth
grade
and
leaving
the
confinement
of
catholic
school,
he
won
a
grade
level
writing
award
for
a
science
fiction/fantasy
short
story.
However,
he
never
felt
as
if
his
writing
were
truly
his
own.
In
seventh
grade,
he
became
disillusioned
and
encountered
stiff
opposition.
It
seemed
that
his
writing
in
English
class
was
just
never
good
enough.
He
always
got
a
B
or
B+
on
his
writing,
rather
than
the
A's
he
was
accustomed
to
from
previous
years.
He
kept
pushing
himself
to
write
something
better
and
better,
but
he
always
seemed
to
fall
short.
Following
these
experiences,
he
decided
to
write
for
no
one
but
himself.
He
spent
much
of
his
free
time
the
following
summer
writing
stories
centered
on
lonely
characters.
In
particular,
he
turned
to
protagonists
who
were
robots
or
androids,
to
contrast
their
feelings
with
the
cold
analytical
nature
of
their
comrades
and
fellow
beings.
In
his
eighth
year
of
schooling,
he
received
his
first
failing
grade
on
a
paper.
He
had
been
presented
with
the
problem
of
what
he
would
ask
if
he
had
a
crystal
ball
and
could
see
anything
in
it.
He
responded
by
questioning
the
wisdom
in
reading
a
particular
book
for
class.
The
teacher
did
not
take
too
kindly
to
that
form
of
insolence
and
forced
him
to
write
another
paper.
He
in
turn
acted
defiantly
and
turned
the
paper
in
late,
which
resulted
in
his
receiving
a
C
grade.
Several
years
later,
he
admits
that
he
deserved
it.
Ironically,
his
early
works
for
this
same
teacher
had
been
well
received
as
pieces
of
writing.
He
had
written
a
number
of
short
stories.
One
of
these
he
was
asked
to
submit
to
the
student
writing
publication
Merlin's
Pen.
Although
it
was
not
accepted
for
publication,
he
still
keeps
the
returned
writing
with
its
comments
on
what
needed
work
and
what
was
good
about
the
piece.
In
many
ways
the
writer's
first
years
of
writing
were
marked
mostly
by
other
events.
He
was
unable
to
find
the
proper
voice
for
his
feelings,
nor
to
overcome
the
resentment
and
apathy
which
had
settled
into
him.
The
summer
before
his
entrance
to
high
school
resulted
in
a
Joyceian
epiphany
of
sorts.
He
found
that
he
was
finally
comfortable
with
his
writing
in
a
sort
form.
He
began
to
keep
a
journal
composed
of
disjointed
thoughts,
shards
of
poetry
and
short
stories.
It
was
this
journal
that
finally
helped
to
find
his
voice
as
a
writer.
Although
he
has
slacked
off
from
it
over
the
past
few
years,
he
still
finds
that
his
able
to
return
to
it
whenever
he
is
stuck
for
ideas
on
a
paper
or
project.
Invariably,
the
closely-kept
personal
thoughts
held
within
its
pages
helped
to
force
out
a
thought
amidst
the
jumble
of
ideas.
His
writing
and
technical
aspects
improved
steadily
with
every
piece.
It
became
such
that
he
was
the
one
chosen
in
groups
and
projects
to
handle
the
writing
duties.
Although
there
was
nothing
particularly
memorable
about
his
ninth
grade
writing,
he
became
very
consistent.
During
tenth
grade,
he
further
explored
the
variations
of
writing.
Although
he
had
always
had
a
creative
impulse
for
such
problems
as
an
abominable
snowman
and
had
attempted
many
different
forms,
he
tried
even
more.
He
wrote
his
historical
survey
of
Mussolini
in
the
form
of
a
letter
to
his
wife
chronicling
ever
mistake
he
had
made,
before
his
lifeless
body
was
hung
by
his
heels
next
to
his
mistress
in
a
small
northern
Italian
town.
He
also
played
around
with
dramatic
presentation
in
the
form
of
play
manuscripts
for
the
first
time.
He
based
his
story
on
a
group
of
hippies
who
were
just
trying
to
get
to
Woodstock.
The
basis
for
this
can
from
the
Is
that
freedom
rock,
man?
infomercials
on
television.
Although
many
of
his
classmates,
and
the
teachers
as
well,
found
it
extremely
amusing
in
its
absurdity
and
its
of
mockery
of
the
hippie
culture,
it
was
not
well
received
by
some.
His
teachers
had
decided
to
put
together
a
compilation
of
the
best
pieces
from
the
class.
They
had
chosen
three
students
to
do
this.
Due
to
the
time
period
it
was
addressing,
it
included
references
to
marijuana,
LSD
and
peyote.
One
of
the
student
evaluators
commented
that
it
advocated
drug
use
and
violence
for
personal
gain.
Interesting,
considering
that
this
piece
chronicled
a
group
of
hippies
during
the
summer
of
love,
where
drug
use
was
rampant
and
violence
non-existent.
Another
decried
it
as
so
poorly
written
it
did
not
deserve
to
be
published
with
[my]
works,
she
certainly
did
not
want
this
piece
anywhere
near
her's.
The
final
evaluator
enjoyed
the
piece
immensely
and
said
it
should
be
included
for
its
originality,
creativity
and
sarcastic
look
at
an
interesting
period
of
time.
To
this
day
the
writer
still
remembers
the
exact
quotes
these
three
wrote.
The
final
two
years
of
high
school
produced
mainly
poetry,
which
he
had
finally
returned
to
after
a
long
hiatus.
It
also
yielded
a
sixty-five
page
paper
detailing
his
senior
research
project.
Further
writing
included
his
college
essays,
which
he
claims
for
the
life
of
him
he
does
not
remember.
Although
he
does
recall
writing
about
music,
the
affect
of
his
senior
research
project
on
his
maturity,
the
bombing
of
Pearl
Harbor
and
computer
processor
chips.
Due
to
his
emphasis
on
engineering,
his
college
career
has
included
only
a
minimal
number
of
writing
courses.
The
two
that
stand
out
the
most
were
taken
during
his
first
year.
It
was
these
two
courses
and
the
overwhelming
positive
comments
that
he
received
from
his
WA
and
his
professors
that
encouraged
him
to
become
a
WA
himself.
Additionally,
he
also
spent
time
writing
for
both
The
Lafayette
and
The
Vid,
which
became
an
outlet
for
his
creative
and
poetic
impulses.
He
began
to
produce
a
number
of
poetry
pieces
and
to
write
even
more
in
his
journal.
Sophomore
and
junior
writing
was
evident
as
well,
although
it
was
focused
on
specific
research
topics.
These
included
political
theory
papers
and
evaluations
of
ethical
concerns
in
engineering.
Additionally,
he
wrote
on
the
influence
of
Huey
Newton
and
the
Black
Panthers
on
the
status
of
African-Americans.
He
also
spent
two
semesters
refining
research
papers
detailing
radiation
absorption
effects
on
human
physiology,
as
well
as
mutagenetic
effects
on
human
reproduction.
His
favorite
works
were
a
research
paper
on
Marc
Chagall
and
a
personal
essay
for
English
110,
as
well
as
a
twenty-one
page
paper
on
the
Korean
war
for
his
first
year
seminar.
At
this
time,
he
had
come
full
circle,
he
found
that
instead
of
being
held
back
by
other
concerns,
he
demanded
the
most
from
his
writing.
He
felt
that
it
was
something
he
did
extremely
well,
and
he
took
an
incredible
amount
of
pride
in
his
ability
to
express
himself
in
the
written
word.
Although
he
does
not
feel
he
has
stopped
his
growth
as
a
writer,
he
also
believes
that
has
come
a
long
way
in
his
literary
maturity.
