NWriting
as
a
WAO
Due
August
11,
2006
Fidgeting
nervously
while
I
listened
to
the
instructions
for
my
first
paper
due
at
the
National
University
of
Ireland,
Galway,
I
was
thinking
of
how
I
would
have
to
learn
a
new
style
of
references,
figure
out
the
expectations
of
Irish
professors,
and
condense
almost
half
a
semesterOs
worth
of
discussion
into
no
more
than
1500
words,
without
knowing
where
or
who
to
ask
for
advice.
I
felt
a
headache,
or
maybe
more
of
a
panic
attack,
starting.
But
then
the
professorOs
sentence,
and
the
sneaky
grin
that
accompanied
it,
brought
back
my
attention;
Nin
my
experience
of
teaching
Irish
and
American
students,O
she
said,
Nthere
is
one
major
difference
between
the
two
styles
of
writing.
Whereas
Irish
students
write
poorly
about
something,
American
students
write
well
about
nothing.O
I
stopped,
feeling
like
she
was
talking
directly
to
me.
In
fact,
I
almost
laughed
out
loud
she
was
so
accurate.
Carrying
this
NskillO
over
from
high
school,
where
teachers
drilled
me
in
how
to
write
the
quickest
paper
that
would
earn
the
highest
SAT
score,
I
have
always
felt
that
it
was
often
easier
to
skip
real
analysis
and
instead
concentrate
on
writing
a
decent
paper
that
was
grammatically
correct
and
stylistically
advanced,
though
lacking
depth.
IOd
never
had
any
reason
not
to
do
this;
professors
graded
my
papers
well
and
complimented
my
writing
ability.
When
I
became
a
WA,
I
liked
how
everyone
focused
on
the
ideas
behind
and
in
the
writing,
talking
about
the
subject
matter
and
topic
rather
than
the
actual
paper
and
style,
which
could
be
worked
out
later.
Yet,
I
didnOt
quite
believe
it.
I
liked
the
idea,
but
practically-speaking,
I
thought
it
was
too
much
effort,
too
drastic,
for
me
to
incorporate
into
my
own
writing
when
my
set
style
seemed
to
be
working.
Over
the
last
year,
however,
by
comparing
my
writing
at
Lafayette
to
my
writing
at
NUIG,
I
realized
that
focusing
on
the
ideas
is
what
makes
a
good
paper,
despite
the
grade.
Essentially,
the
whole
point
of
writing
is
to
convey
oneOs
ideas
and
thoughts
and
to
work
through
oneOs
thought
process,
not
a
means
to
mask
oneOs
lack
of
understanding
or
oneOs
ability
to
rephrase
another
personOs
ideas.
After
reviewing
my
work
over
the
past
year,
I
noticed
that
my
best
writing
is
my
honest
work,
the
papers
where
I
feel
passionate
about
my
topic
and
am
earnestly
using
my
writing
to
learn
more
about
the
subject.
They
might
not
be
my
best-written
papers,
but
the
writing
samples
that
stick
out
in
my
mind
as
the
ones
that
I
am
most
proud
of
for
the
year,
the
ones
I
actually
kept,
are
the
ones
in
my
journal
for
my
womenOs
studies
single
motherhood
class.
Perhaps
because
it
was
not
a
formal
assignment,
its
percentage
in
my
overall
grade
was
not
mentioned,
or
because
the
professor
was
so
relaxed,
I
felt
like
I
could
experiment
with
the
journal
and
use
it
as
a
means
to
further
work
out
to
readings
I
was
being
exposed
to.
I
would
type
the
three
page
assignments
in
less
than
forty
minutes,
yet
it
was
some
of
my
best
work.
The
topics
intrigued
me;
IOd
read
accounts
of
pregnant
teenage
girls
and
how
they
had
come
to
be
single
moms
and
realize
that
there
was
this
wealth
of
new
perspective
and
lifestyles
that
I
had
never
really
contemplated;
my
writing
responses
helped
me
sort
out
my
previous
feeling
on
the
topics
with
the
new
information
that
was
changing
those
perspectives.
My
professor
noticed
and
I
never
received
lower
than
the
highest
grade;
she
commented
on
my
honesty,
my
progression,
my
use
of
textual
evidence.
For
once,
I
wasnOt
using
the
text
as
an
easy
way
to
base
my
argument
and
reiterate
the
main
ideas
in
three
set
points;
I
was
using
the
stories
and
information
to
shape
my
ideas
and,
in
turn,
support
my
new
thoughts.
I
didnOt
try
too
hard
with
my
journals;
I
didnOt
feel
the
need
to
prove
myself
to
my
professor
or
to
write
pretending
I
was
knowledgeable;
she
knew
we
were
all
learning
and
working
through
the
new
topic
and
she
was
more
interested
in
seeing
how
our
new
views
were
being
changed
and
shaped
through
the
texts,
not
to
read
how
we
all
were
suddenly
experts
on
single
motherhood.
In
fact,
having
this
same
professor
for
two
classes,
I
also
had
to
write
another
journal
for
her
other
class
about
the
Irish
literary
Renaissance.
My
approach
to
this
journal
was
slightly
different;
I
knew
that
I
was
supposed
to
be
analyzing
the
texts
for
literary
components
and
responding
to
the
author
and
the
techniques
rather
than
just
expressing
my
personal
opinions
on
the
works.
Accordingly,
I
would
have
to
take
a
more
intellectually
analytical
approach,
which
I
found
a
difficult
task
based
on
the
works.
Yet,
by
slowly
looking
at
them
line
for
line
and
outlining
my
ideas,
I
could
string
together
enough
of
a
meaning
based
on
the
evidence
to
present
the
ultimate
meaning
I
derived
from
the
work.
As
hesitant
as
I
was
at
first
to
turn
the
journal
in,
knowing
that
it
did
count
towards
my
grade
and
feeling
uneasy
about
whether
I
derived
the
right
meaning
out
of
the
works,
I
soon
found
that
for
once,
it
wasnOt
my
style,
but
my
ideas,
that
were
being
graded.
One
particular
instance
stands
out
where,
after
passing
in
an
entry
outlining
how
I
believed
a
poem
to
be
romantic
and
selfless,
the
class
discussed
how
the
poem
was
actually
incredibly
sexist.
I
wanted
to
sneak
my
paper
out
of
the
pile
and
take
the
zero,
but
surprisingly
when
I
got
it
back,
I
had
received
an
A.
The
comments
stated
that
as
much
as
my
analysis
was
a
bit
off,
it
was
well
supported
and
thought
out
and
since
thatOs
the
purpose
of
reading,
analyzing,
and
writing,
I
received
full
credit.
Oddly,
that
paper
made
me
feel
confident
in
my
abilities
more
than
any
other,
knowing
that
with
enough
effort
and
evidence,
any
paper
could
be
a
quality
one.
When
I
was
faced
with
writing
my
papers
in
Ireland,
however,
that
confidence
vanished
and
I
felt
like
a
freshman
all
over
again.
The
journals
and
the
ease
and
honesty
with
which
I
wrote
them
seemed
far
away.
Instead
I
was
overwhelmed
with
the
new
expectations
and
audience;
were
Irish
students
more
intellectual
and
thoughtful,
graded
more
harshly,
supposed
to
write
with
more
polish?
My
writing
and
my
original
ideas
didnOt
seem
eloquent
or
important
enough
to
earn
a
good
grade.
In
my
big
lecture
classes,
we
had
one
paper,
one
chance,
to
earn
a
decent
grade.
I
panicked.
I
hadnOt
read
all
the
assigned
books,
the
ones
I
did
read
I
didnOt
feel
any
particular
passion
for,
and
the
essay
topics
didnOt
seem
very
interesting
to
me.
Following
what
my
friend
did,
I
buried
myself
in
research
to
hide
my
lack
of
knowledge.
I
spent
hours
going
through
criticism,
finding
other
and
more
knowledgeable
peopleOs
ideas,
to
base
my
own
ideas
around
since
I
didnOt
feel
confident
enough
in
my
own
opinions.
I
perfectly
exemplified
BartholomaeOs
idea
that
students
assume
that
teachers
and
other
literary
critics,
Nhave
a
way
of
talking
about
the
town
that
is
ObetterO
(and
for
arbitrary
reasons)
than
theirsO
(447).
Seven
pages,
which
would
take
me
a
few
hours
at
Lafayette,
took
me
days
to
write
in
Ireland.
In
the
end,
I
felt
like
I
was
quilting
a
paper,
not
writing
it.
I
would
try
to
take
the
research
ideas
and
string
them
together,
sometimes
daring
to
insert
my
own
opinion
which
usually
just
reinforced
the
criticsO
original
thoughts.
I
found
it
much
more
difficult
to
establish
a
flow
to
the
paper,
to
connect
all
the
ideas,
whereas
my
previous
methods
of
working
with
my
own
ideas
and
using
other
criticism
to
demonstrate
my
thoughts
made
for
a
much
more
interesting,
original,
and
fluid
paper.
Like
Batholomae
notes,
I
was
the
writer
who
Nlost
himself
in
the
discourse
of
his
readersO
(446).
Even
though
I
had
plenty
of
textual
evidence
and
I
had
spent
more
time
than
usual
on
my
papers,
I
felt
uneasy
passing
them
in
as
if
they
could
be
anyoneOs,
they
had
so
little
originality
to
them.
In
fact,
the
only
class
I
took
in
Ireland
where
I
felt
comfortable
enough
in
the
situation
to
experiment
with
my
writing
was
taught
by
the
professor
who
so
accurately
categorized
American
versus
Irish
writing.
Capped
at
thirteen
students,
the
class
was
small
enough
to
give
me
the
chance
to
know
the
professor
and
her
expectations.
I
kept
up
with
the
reading
materials
and
participated
in
the
class
discussions
enough
that
I
formed
and
voiced
my
opinions
on
the
texts
enough
to
feel
confident
in
them.
Papers
for
these
classes
I
could
write
easily;
in
fact,
my
only
problem
was
condensing
all
my
ideas
into
the
word
limit.
I
didnOt
get
bogged
down
with
outside
research;
my
ideas
were
enough
and
with
the
textual
evidence
in
the
novels
themselves,
I
had
a
strong
argument
to
support
my
theories.
Moreover,
I
knew
that
my
paper
was
original
and
consisted
of
my
own
ideas
that
were
supported,
not
characterized,
by
outside
research.
I
had
used
my
writing
as
a
tool
to
convey
my
thoughts
on
the
texts
as
a
critic,
even
if
I
was
taking
liberties
in
playing
that
role,
as
Bartholomae
discusses.
However,
by
experimenting
with
that
role,
I
was
also
able
to
write
passionately
and
with
confidence
more
than
I
would
have
if
I
were
quilting
together
another
peopleOs
thoughts
on
the
topic.
That
confidence,
believing
in
the
ideas
that
you
are
writing
about
and
having
a
passion
for
them,
is
what
I
have
found
to
be
the
key
to
good
writing.
Flawless
grammar
and
advanced
sentence
structure
will
not
make
a
good
writer
if
he
or
she
is
talking
about
nothing.
Good
writing
comes
from
good
ideas;
how
many
famous
authors
NbreakO
grammatical
rules,
but
produce
brilliant
literature?
After
working
on
my
own
writing
and
being
a
WA,
I
think
IOve
finally
been
able
to
understand
the
truth
and
brilliance
in
the
simple
strategy
of
the
college
writing
center
to
encourage
student
writers
to
focus
on
ideas
instead
of
writing
mechanics.
The
class
I
was
assigned
to
work
with
last
year
was
a
first
year
seminar
about
testing.
The
students
were
typical
freshman;
meeting
with
them
immediately
reminded
me
how
unsure
I
felt
about
my
writing
during
my
first
year
of
college.
The
professor
had
the
students
fill
out
a
form
about
their
writing
history
and
many
of
them
expressed
anxiety
that
their
previous
experiences
may
not
be
adequate
enough
for
college.
I
remembered
my
first
year
seminar,
feeling
like
my
professors
were
so
much
more
intelligent
and
experienced
than
even
the
high
school
teachers
I
was
used
to
as
my
audience
and
that
these
professors
were
accustomed
to
a
much
higher
caliber
of
work
than
mine.
This
mindset
made
my
professors
seem
unapproachable
and
unrelenting
so
I
would
spend
hours
pouring
over
my
work,
unsure
of
its
quality.
Even
my
WA
seemed
so
much
smarter
and
rather
than
having
a
conversation
with
him
about
my
work,
I
would
wordlessly
agree
with
his
suggestions.
Remembering
this,
I
tried
to
be
careful
in
my
techniques;
IOd
read
over
each
personal
profile
before
reading
the
student
papers,
paying
special
attention
to
the
writersO
concerns
and
evaluating
what
the
best
approach
to
the
conference
would
be.
One
student
who
stood
out
in
my
mind
proved
the
most
difficult
and
he
was
far
from
lazy,
unmotivated,
or
unintelligent.
Rather,
he
lacked
confidence,
the
key
to
writing.
He
made
it
clear
in
his
personal
writing
history
profile
that
he
thought
he
was
a
bad
writer
and
that
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
to
improve
it.
Reading
his
work,
it
did
need
some
help,
but
it
was
far
from
unsalvageable.
The
only
problem
was
that
he
was
convinced
he
couldnOt
produce
better
work.
I
made
my
comments
as
constructive
and
positive
as
possible
and
tried
to
engage
the
student
in
a
discussion
of
the
topic
and
ideas,
rather
than
the
mechanics,
but
he
was
so
focused
on
remembering
my
comments
and
asking
about
grammar
that
it
seemed
pointless.
He
was
uptight
and
seemed
to
think
I
was
an
authority
on
writing
and
I
realized
that
in
order
to
have
a
productive
conference,
he
needed
to
see
that
he
was
the
authority
on
his
writing.
If
he
believed
that
he
was
the
authority
on
his
writing,
if
he
owned
his
ideas,
and
wrote
about
them
passionately,
his
paper
would
already
be
greatly
improved.
Neglecting
mechanics,
his
writing
just
needed
to
be
assertive,
to
discuss
the
topic
with
some
real
analysis
that
he
believed
in.
Once
he
got
past
that
and
believed
that
his
ideas
were
worth
reading,
his
paper
would
fall
into
place.
In
fact,
this
student
was
the
exact
opposite
of
one
of
his
classmates.
No
more
talented
than
her
peer,
this
girlOs
writing
mechanics
could
also
be
improved,
but
she
had
passion
and
cared
about
the
topics.
She
owned
her
ideas;
she
took
the
topic
and
ran
with
it,
researching
different
perspectives,
obtaining
different
views,
and
forming
her
own
opinions.
This
student
was
passionate
about
her
papers
and
made
them
important
to
her,
which
made
her
more
inclined
to
spend
time
and
research
them.
Although
her
writing
style
wasnOt
perfect,
it
wasnOt
a
problem.
Her
writing
skills
were
adequate
enough
to
convey
her
otherwise
brilliant
ideas
and
her
enthusiasm
came
through
in
her
writing,
making
the
other
details
unimportant.
The
substance
in
her
paper
was
better;
she
made
sure
it
had
body
and
evidence
and
that
she
proved
each
of
her
thoughts.
If
a
writer
can
write
strongly
about
issues,
the
rest
is
easy
to
fix;
it
is
much
harder
to
rethink
ideas
and
form
opinions
and
issues
on
an
entire
topic
than
it
is
to
review
the
proper
usage
of
commas.
In
realizing
this,
that
confidence
in
oneOs
ideas
is
the
key
to
strong
writing,
I
reshaped
my
conferences.
Rather
than
delving
right
into
the
papers
and
discussing
organization
and
major
problems,
IOd
discuss
the
topic
with
the
students
and
get
a
feel
for
their
thoughts
on
the
assignment,
their
individual
take
on
the
subject
matter,
and
the
thoughts
they
conveyed
through
their
writing.
The
dialogue
led
to
a
much
fuller
discussion
of
the
paper
and
ended
up
solving
many
of
the
initial
problems
in
a
more
constructive
way.
I
tried
to
make
writing
a
conversation,
to
show
that
the
paper
should
reflect
that;
it
was
their
own
discussion
of
the
topic
and
their
chance
to
demonstrate
their
views
on
the
subject
matter.
Once
the
students
talked
about
it
and
felt
confident
in
their
opinions,
they
could
convey
those
ideas
with
passion,
the
flow
of
the
paper
moving
with
their
thoughts,
and
the
writing
mechanics
easily
solved
later
in
the
process.
Especially
after
the
past
year,
comparing
my
formal
and
informal
writing
assignments
as
well
as
writing
in
two
different
environments,
IOve
finally
realized
that
confidence
and
passion
are
the
keys
to
writing.
One
must
feel
passionate
about
oneOs
paper
topic
to
the
point
that
they
are
confident
about
the
ideas,
even
if
those
ideas
are
just
the
recognition
that
the
author
isnOt
fully
sure
of
their
ideas
and
are
using
their
writing
to
explore
their
different
options.
The
substance
in
the
paper
is
what
is
important,
just
as
the
college
writing
program
stresses
and
just
as
I
am
beginning
to
realize,
because
itOs
better
to
write
poorly
on
something
than
it
is
