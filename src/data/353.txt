Literary
Narrative
A
Narrative
of
my
Growth
in
Literacy
To
best
describe
my
history
as
a
writer
I
find
it
most
fitting
to
begin
with
the
act
of
reading
rather
than
the
act
of
writing,
since
it
has
been
my
experience
that
the
former
stimulates
and
improves
the
latter.
I
began
reading
at
an
early
age
and
quickly
discovered
it
to
be
my
favorite
past
time.
Growing
up
amongst
three
elder
siblings
who
also
enjoyed
reading
gave
me
an
array
of
challenging
reading
material
at
my
disposal.
Novels
like
Black
Beauty,
Anne
of
Green
Gables
and
Moby
Dick
are
some
examples
of
favorite
books
that
both
challenged
and
enticed
me
as
a
young
reader.
The
stories
in
books
like
these
always
interested
me,
but,
as
an
eight-year-old
child,
my
full
reading
experience
was
often
curbed
by
the
barricade
of
extensive
vocabulary.
However,
by
the
use
of
context
clues,
the
dictionary
or
simply
by
repetition,
I
soon
began
to
discover
the
meaning
of
these
challenging
words.
When
this
occurred,
reading
took
on
a
new
form
for
me
and
I
enjoyed
it
even
more.
I
was
amazed
at
how
creatively
thoughts,
ideas
and
experiences
could
be
expressed
through
writing.
I
think
this
experience
sparked
my
earliest
interest
in
writing
to
express
myself.
I
remember
thinking
how
wonderful
it
was
to
be
able
to
relate
ideas
and
thoughts.
The
first
act
of
writing
that
I
can
remember
is
writing
in
my
personal
journals.
Happy
or
sad,
disturbed
or
simply
satisfied,
I
wrote
in
my
journals
on
a
daily
basis.
My
journals
began
as
a
recording
of
the
day's
events
and
included
some
observations
of
moments
that
I
did
not
want
to
forget.
After
I
had
filled
one
journal,
it
was
onto
the
next.
At
the
age
of
ten
I
had
over
fifteen
journals
and
was
still
writing
almost
everyday.
I
found
that
this
type
of
free
writing
was
very
relaxing
and
helped
me
sort
out
emotions
and
ideas.
As
I
got
older
and
my
journals
kept
increasing,
I
enjoyed
paging
through
my
earlier
journals
and
realizing
how
I
had
grown
or
what
I
had
learned.
Writing
in
journals
was
my
first
real
experience
with
writing
and
I
still
write
in
a
journal
today.
Although
I
do
not
have
the
time
or
the
motivation
to
write
in
a
journal
every
day
of
the
week,
I
try
to
set
aside
time
every
month
to
write
something.
I
currently
have
thirty-four
journals
since
I
started
writing
in
them
at
the
age
of
eight
and
I
treasure
each
one
as
they
are
a
written
recording
of
my
thoughts,
ideas
and
experiences.
Although
writing
in
journals
was
my
first
writing
experience,
these
journals
were
personal
and
I
did
not
share
them
with
family
or
friends.
My
earliest
experience
in
writing
something
with
the
intent
to
show
it
to
others
was
during
my
free
time
with
my
friends
as
a
young
child.
In
fourth
grade,
my
friends
and
I
formed
a
Drama
Club
in
which
we
would
meet
in
my
playhouse
and
create
plays
with
the
intention
to
eventually
perform
them
in
front
of
an
audience.
I
was
always
assigned
as
the
chief
writer
and
editor
of
these
plays
and
I
took
my
position
very
seriously.
I
can
remember
staying
awake
long
past
my
bedtime
in
order
to
finish
a
scene
of
the
play
I
was
currently
writing.
This
was
my
first
experience
in
writing
something
that
would
be
viewed
by
someone
else.
I
enjoyed
doing
this
very
much
and
it
was
in
knowing
that
others
would
read
my
work
that
kept
me
eager
and
motivated
to
produce
something
well
written
and
interesting.
The
feedback
I
received
from
my
peers
was
always
positive
and
I
think
this
experience
helped
me
to
gain
the
confidence
in
my
writing
that
I
possess
today.
Writing
in
journals
gave
me
self-satisfaction
and
writing
for
my
friends
granted
me
positive
feedback,
however
I
had
yet
to
experience
writing
in
the
academia
setting
in
which
my
aim
was
to
satisfy
a
teacher.
In
fifth
grade
of
elementary
school
I
had
my
first
real
experience
in
writing
for
this
type
of
thing.
Every
student
in
my
grade
was
expected
to
write
an
essay
for
a
contest
entitled
"What
an
American
President
Means
to
me."
Although
I
had
written
small
essays
or
papers
for
my
teachers
before,
the
assignments
were
neither
competitive
nor
challenging
like
this
essay
writing
contest.
This
was
the
first
time
I
saw
writing
as
a
challenge
that
I
wanted
to
overcome.
I
worked
very
hard
on
my
essay
and
did
not
hand
in
my
essay
until
I
thought
it
was
the
best
I
could
possibly
do.
A
week
later
it
was
announced
that
I
had
won
second
place
in
the
contest
and
was
invited
to
read
my
essay
in
front
of
my
peers,
teachers
and
principal
at
a
class
assembly.
I
felt
proud
and
almost
empowered
as
I
started
to
realize
what
my
capability
to
write
could
offer.
Up
until
this
point
in
my
life
writing
had
only
been
personal
reflection
and
a
fun
past
time
with
my
friends,
but
this
incident
made
me
realize
the
hard
working
and
competitive
academic
side
to
writing
which
I
had
not
experienced
before.
This
experience
is
a
fond
memory
and
I
think
it
is
here
that
I
first
learned
what
it
was
like
to
write
at
an
academic
level.
After
this
experience
I
realized
I
had
a
talent
for
writing
that
I
wished
to
pursue.
The
following
summer
I
attended
a
seven-day
writing
camp
at
Penn
State
University.
Confident
and
excited
I
went
to
the
camp
eager
to
learn.
However,
within
the
first
few
hours
at
my
first
writing
workshop
I
soon
realized
that
every
student
there
was
an
excellent
writer.
My
confidence
quickly
dwindled
and
I
knew
that
although
I
had
talent
I
was
going
to
have
to
work
hard
for
the
next
seven-days.
The
camp's
itinerary
consisted
of
three
writing
workshops
everyday
in
which
students
could
engage
in
creative,
expository
and
critical
writing.
At
the
end
of
the
week
the
students
were
required
to
submit
their
best
work
into
the
professors
who
in
turn
compiled
this
work
into
a
book
that
was
published
at
the
end
of
the
week.
As
if
this
wasn't
intimidating
enough,
the
students
who
attended
this
camp
were
ages
ten
to
fourteen
and
I
had
only
recently
turned
eleven.
For
the
first
time
I
felt
very
pressured
and
extremely
conscientious
about
my
writing.
I
had
never
experienced
this
type
of
high
intensity
writing
with
other
writers
that
were
equal
or
above
my
level.
However,
this
type
of
experience
was
very
valuable
to
shaping
the
type
of
writer
I
am
today.
My
seven
days
spent
at
the
writing
camp
taught
me
that
I
was
capable
of
pushing
myself
to
literary
levels
that
I
was
not
aware
I
could
reach.
I
learned
how
to
write
above
my
level
as
well
as
read
works
of
others
that
were
on
a
higher
level
as
well.
Although
I
wasn't
as
confident
as
a
writer
when
I
left
the
camp
seven
days
later,
I
knew
the
things
I
needed
to
learn
to
become
the
writer
I
wanted
to
be.
The
next
few
years
leading
into
high
school,
I
kept
the
skills
I
learned
at
the
camp
and
the
skills
I
knew
I
could
perfect
in
my
mind
and
used
them
to
become
a
stronger
writer.
My
writing
experiences
in
high
school
were
very
positive.
Freshman
year
I
placed
into
the
high
level
reading
and
writing
class
and
this
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
take
Honors
English
and
a
creative
writing
class.
Although
these
classes
and
assignments
were
challenging,
it
was
not
until
my
junior
year
of
Advanced
Placement
English
that
I
experienced
my
most
difficult
challenges
in
writing.
This
class
was
taught
on
a
college
level
by
a
former
English
professor
of
a
local
college.
The
amount
and
caliber
of
work
expected
for
this
class
was
intense
and
extremely
difficult.
The
class
emphasized
expository
writing
on
essays
and
literary
works
by
such
authors
as
Henry
David
Thoreau,
John
Milton
and
Friedrich
Nietzsche.
The
teacher
of
this
class
was
highly
concerned
with
grammar
and
essay
structure.
Her
grading
was
very
tough
and
every
paper
was
scrutinized
to
the
highest
degree.
This
was
the
first
time
I
began
to
dislike
writing.
The
assignments
were
difficult
and
tedious
and
the
feedback
I
received
from
my
papers
was
mostly
negative.
I
began
to
feel
as
if
my
writing
skills
would
never
improve
and
I
dreaded
every
new
writing
assignment.
However,
the
year
ended
and
I
received
a
satisfactory
grade
in
the
class
as
well
as
new
writing
knowledge
that
I
will
never
forget.
I
think
this
writing
class
was
the
most
difficult
English
class
I
have
ever
taken
and
it
was
also
the
most
beneficial.
Although
I
struggled
through
the
class
and
received
much
negative
feedback
that
frustrated
me
and
made
me
feel
as
if
I
would
never
learn
to
write
well,
this
class
is
the
reason
I
felt
so
prepared
to
write
on
a
college
level.
My
teacher
and
the
class
requirements
took
my
writing
skills
and
made
me
refine,
revise,
and
reevaluate
them
until
I
was
ready
to
quit.
As
much
as
I
have
always
loved
to
write,
this
class
made
me
hate
it,
dread
it
and
even
fear
it.
However,
I
left
that
class
with
a
newfound
respect
for
writing,
for
my
teacher
and
most
importantly
for
myself.
Entering
my
freshman
year
of
college
I
was
a
little
nervous
to
write
my
first
college
paper.
Although
I
felt
prepared,
I
was
unsure
of
what
to
expect
and
if
my
preparation
would
be
enough
to
succeed.
My
first
semester
I
wrote
many
lab
reports
and
a
few
papers
for
History,
but
it
wasn't
until
my
English
110
class
during
my
second
semester
that
I
began
to
get
excited
about
writing
again.
In
this
class
we
wrote
various
papers
on
novels
and
essays.
However,
none
of
these
papers
were
officially
graded.
Instead
the
professor
wrote
comments
in
which
the
student
could
revise
and
perfect
their
paper.
At
the
end
of
the
semester
the
student
was
required
to
pick
one
paper,
revise
it
completely
and
hand
it
in
as
a
final
draft
that
would
be
graded.
In
addition
to
this,
the
professor
arranged
conferences
during
the
semester
in
which
the
student
could
be
evaluated
on
their
work
thus
far.
I
enjoyed
this
type
of
itinerary
because
it
allowed
and
encouraged
progression
in
the
student's
writing.
Personally,
I
think
that
I
progressed
as
a
writer
extensively
in
this
class.
Since
there
was
so
much
emphasis
placed
on
revision
and
refining
I
had
the
opportunity
to
evaluate
what
I
really
wanted
to
express
in
my
paper.
I
think
this
is
a
very
important
aspect
of
writing
because,
as
I
learned
from
this
class,
many
writers
crowd
their
papers
with
unneeded
words
and
sentences.
Revising
my
papers
in
this
class
taught
me
that
when
writing,
sometimes
simplicity
is
better.
It
also
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
recognize
my
progression
as
a
writer
and
as
a
result,
understand
my
literary
strengths
and
weaknesses.
My
past
experiences
as
a
writer
has
shaped
the
type
of
writer
I
am
today.
It
was
reading
that
first
sparked
my
desire
to
write
and
make
use
of
words
and
different
vocabulary.
My
personal
journals
gave
me
the
freedom
to
do
this
in
creative
self-reflection
and
descriptions
of
everyday
experiences.
Elementary
school
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
first
expose
my
writing
to
others
in
both
a
positive
comfortable
atmosphere
and
also
a
more
competitive
academic
atmosphere.
The
literary
confidence
I
gained
from
these
experiences
was
then
challenged
as
my
writing
skills
were
put
to
the
test
and
forced
to
rise
to
a
higher
level
at
the
Penn
State
Writing
Camp
I
attended.
Although
High
School
brought
me
much
success
in
my
writings,
my
Advanced
Placement
writing
class
showed
me
the
hard
work,
frustration
and
tedium
that
good
writing
can
entail.
Lastly,
my
College
110
English
class
taught
me
the
importance
of
revision,
simplicity
and
most
of
all,
progression
in
one's
writing.
Reflecting
on
my
writing
experiences
this
far,
I
think
that
I
have
had
enough
difficult
challenges
as
well
as
positive
feedback
to
make
me
into
the
confident
but
also
hardworking
writer
that
I
am
today.
I
understand
that
writing
is
a
constant
process
that
is
never
really
completed,
but
in
working
towards
that
completion
one
can
learn
many
thing
about
himself
and
his
ability.
