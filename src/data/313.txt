WA
ESSAY--
I
fail
to
recall
my
first
experiences
with
the
written
word.
Chances
are
that
the
first
time
I
picked
up
one
of
those
clunky
oversized
pencils
I
merely
nibbled
on
its
shiny
wood
exterior,
not
knowing
or
caring
exactly
for
what
the
instrument
was
made.
At
an
older
age
I
probably
began
to
doodle,
filling
sheets
of
blank
white
paper
with
circles
or
squiggly
lines
as
I
pleased--
carelessly,
thoughtlessly,
at
first.
Sometime
later,
I
find
my
first
memories
of
real
writing.
I
remember--with
regret--the
tedious
process
of
writing
book
reports
in
elementary
school
on
the
likes
of
Deputy
Dan
or
alien
stories
by
Bruce
Coville.
I
enjoyed
the
reading
per
se
but
summarizing
never
interested
me
because
it
had
no
real
function.
Giving
other
children
in
the
class
a
synopsis
of
what
I
had
read
could
not
deliver
the
same
suspense
I
had
felt
wondering
how
a
certain
story
would
reach
its
conclusion,
how
the
bad
guy
would
get
his
due,
or
how
an
alien's
identity
would
be
discovered.
In
fact,
summarizing
deprived
me
of
the
very
thing
I
loved
and
still
love
most
about
reading--analysis,
the
process
of
"figuring
out"
so
to
speak.
I
liked
to
observe
the
psychology
of
the
characters
and
attempt
to
see
the
ways
that
the
seemingly
insignificant
events
of
their
lives
shaped
them,
as
it
turned
out
by
page
98,
so
significantly.
Somehow,
listing
facts
like
"Bobby--
son;
Jonathan--father;
Rover--dog;
in
this
story
Bobby
goes
to
get
Rover
from
the
store
and
his
father
gets
very
angry,"
did
not
delve
into
meaning
of
the
book
for
me.
It
conveyed
no
other
information
except
that
I
had
read
the
book.
Of
course,
this
insulted
me
because
I
read
all
the
books
and
felt
that
there
was
no
need
to
do
these
little
reports
to
show
that
to
the
teacher,
who
should
know
me
well
enough
to
know
I
had
done
the
reading
anyway.
Luckily
Pizza
Hut
(r)
gave
away
individual
pan
pizzas
to
elementary
school
kids
for
reading
a
certain
amount
of
books,
so
all
of
that
mindless
summarization
at
least
went
to
increasing
my
Calorie
intake,
contributing
to
future
heart
disease,
and
preparing
me
for
late
night
college
binges.
Book
reports,
however,
were
not
the
sole
hair
on
the
literary
education
head
of
my
elementary
school.
Thankfully,
my
teachers,
Ms.
Sterling
and
Mrs.
Zanzucchi,
encouraged
our
creative
writing
as
well,
even
in
the
first
grade.
Mrs.
Zanzucchi
submitted
a
poem,
entitled
"A
Bug's
Life,"
which
I
had
written
for
a
class
project,
to
a
children's
magazine.
It
printed
my
poem
about
a
certain
bug's
life
patrolling
toadstools,
making
me
the
happiest
first-grader
on
the
planet
at
the
time.
I
personally
showed
my
poem
to
all
the
teachers
I
knew
and
gave
them
autographed
copies,
just
like
the
truly
beneficent
celebrity
that
I
was.
I
would
like
to
reveal
the
deep
symbolism
and
great
revelations
on
the
dismal
nature
of
the
tedium
of
life
contained
within
that
poem
of
my
early
years,
but,
sadly,
there
is
none.
Then,
at
some
point
in
my
life
there
must
have
been
a
gigantic
city-wide
course
for
current
teachers
in
which
each
one
learned
that
she
should
have
all
of
her
students
keep
journals
as
the
new
number-one
teaching
tool.
I
would
like
to
shoot
whomever
it
was
who
taught
that
course.
Then
again,
perhaps
shooting
them
would
be
a
tad
strong--instead
I
might
make
him
journal
every
day
of
his
elementary
school
life
and
see
how
he
likes
it
when
there
is
a
teacher
waiting
in
the
wings
to
read
it
and
bestow
upon
the
class
a
new
"journal
question
of
the
day."
Soon,
however,
I
found
that
I
could
make
my
journal
entries
have
a
purpose
entirely
different
from
simply
annoying
me--political
gain
at
the
most,
and
comical
relief
at
the
least.
Do
not
misunderstand
me
and
think
that
by
"political
gain"
I
mean
"brown-nosing;"
no,
instead,
it
was
the
exact
opposite.
I
would
rant
about
everything
I
didn't
like
that
the
teacher
might
have
the
slightest
control
over,
things
that
we
could
not
complain
about
in
class
because
we
would
get
in
trouble
for
having
"smart
mouths."
Well,
I
turned
my
"smart-mouth"
into
"smart-writing."
I
recently
reviewed
some
of
my
eighth-grade
journal
entries,
and
discovered
that
most
were
dedicated
to
ranting
about
how
gym
class
was
taken
away
from
us
for
one
reason
or
another,
such
as
setting
up
for
an
assembly,
or
the
weather
being
too
cold
outside.
Of
course,
none
of
those
entries
actually
earned
us
extra
or
better
gym
time,
but
as
I
said
before,
they
were
at
least
good
for
my
own
amusement.
Some
of
my
most
memorable
experiences
in
writing
have
come
from
writing
with
my
imagination,
and
most
of
those
outside
of
the
classroom.
My
first
serious
creative
writing
project,
however,
did
come
as
a
result
of
a
classroom
assignment
in
sixth
grade.
The
teacher,
Ms.
Elsey,
was
good
enough
to
give
us
the
challenge
of
writing
our
own
short
story.
While
most
students
grumbled
about
having
to
write
a
three-page
story,
I
was
ecstatic
and
adopted
the
project
as
a
seriously
fun
undertaking.
I
had
never
completed
a
whole
story
before,
but
now
getting
a
good
grade
motivated
me
to
finish
what
I
began.
I
typed
every
day
after
school,
and
delivered
to
Ms.
Elsey
a
20-page
manuscript
of
epic
proportions
entitled,
"Flyboy,"
which
I
immediately
sold
to
make
a
movie
and
the
appropriate
action
figures.
All
right
so
I
named
characters
with
variations
of
names
from
"I
Love
Lucy,"
and
there
was
no
epic
storyline,
but
it
was
new
for
me.
Writing
"Flyboy,"
was
the
first
time
I
had
tried
to
incorporate
serious
issues
like
child
abuse
and
the
responsibilities
and
definitions
of
a
"parent"
in
my
work.
I
had
to
learn
to
build
suspense
as
my
favorite
writers
had,
learn
the
benefits
of
planning
before
I
wrote
(though
much
of
the
story
I
wrote
spontaneously
from
my
mind)
and
learn
to
edit
afterwards
to
make
sure
everything
"fit."
I
think
that
the
funniest
thing
about
"Flyboy,"
as
I
read
it
now
is
that
I
was
so
specific
about
times
in
the
story
when
I
wrote
it.
I
wrote
sentences
like,
"I
went
to
get
the
bread
at
9:38
am,
seven
minutes
later
at
about
10:45
I
was
able
to
leave
the
house."
That
went
on
throughout
the
piece.
Well
I
guess
I
wrongly
supposed
that
it
made
the
story
more
believable
if
all
the
times
were
exact,
but
now
I
realize
the
benefits
of
not
clogging
the
story
too
much
with
details
or
too
much
with
generalities.
"Flyboy"
taught
me
more
about
writing
and
writing
creatively
then
I
could
ever
imagine
at
the
time
as
I
typed
away
furiously
at
the
computer.
Sometimes,
we
learn
lessons
the
fun
and
exciting
way,
as
it
was
with
"Flyboy,"
but
then,
of
course,
we
learn
the
hard
way..
.sometimes
we
get
"D's"
on
our
first
AP
History
papers.
A
"D"
when
we
thought
the
grade
would
be
an
"A,"
just
like
in
every
other
class
at
the
time.
The
"D"
Mrs.
Giampetro
gave
me
on
my
first
AP
History
paper
stood
for
"discovery."
Perhaps
initially
it
stood
for
"demeaning,"
"despicable,"
and
"depressing"
as
well.
For
the
purposes
of
writing
this
paper
however,
I
will
leave
the
meaning
of
the
"D"
to
"discovery."
I
discovered
that
the
style
of
writing
that
suited
me
to
that
point
in
subjects
like
religion
or
English
would
not
earn
me
the
same
grades
in
History.
I
had
developed
a
metaphor
that
depicted
the
first
thirteen
colonies
as
footsteps
on
a
path
and
so
forth
only
to
discover
a
large
"x"
on
the
whole
introduction
and
a
"see
me"
at
the
end
of
the
paper.
This
was
not,
unfortunately,
a
"you
just
did
the
best
job
in
the
whole
class"
see
me,
but
rather
an
"I
hate
your
writing,"
see
me.
Very
different.
I
never
improved
at
writing
those
papers
until
the
next
year,
in
the
second
half
of
the
course.
I
simply
could
not
grasp
the
feeling
of
"history
writing"
as
I
had
adapted
so
easily
before
in
other
courses.
Mrs.
McGraw,
my
senior
AP
History
teacher,
made
the
process
much
easier
by
fully
explaining
it
to
our
class.
After
that
lecture
I
steadily
improved
my
papers
until
I
was
able
to
write
them
far
better
in
class
than
I
could
out
of
class
spending
hours
toiling
away
at
a
computer.
I
developed
a
cleaner,
cut-to-the-chase
style
of
writing
with
smoother
transitions
and
complex
theses.
It
was
actually
this
second
semester
of
AP
History
with
Mrs.
McGraw
that
improved
my
writing..
.Mrs.
Giampetro
remained
content
tormenting
me
and
leaving
me
in
the
writing
abyss
of
anguish.
Soon
after
my
AP
History
II
class
and
the
AP
History
test
came
graduation
and
summertime.
I
was
ready
to
begin
college,
and
therefore
ready
for
the
co-requisite
of
"college
writing."
I
did
not
know
exactly
what
that
term
was
to
hold
in
practical
use--was
it
really
any
different
than
my
AP
writing?
I
had
passed
the
AP
English
exam,
and
therefore
opted
out
of
taking
English
101.
I
opted
in,
however,
to
English
205
-
Literary
Questions,
and
took
the
required
FYS.
Although
writing
in
English
205
with
Dr.
Westfall
proved
not
significantly
different
than
AP
English
4
writing,
drafting
for
my
FYS,
Political
Humor
with
Professor
Lennertz,
shocked
me.
Until
his
course,
I
was
used
to
writing
a
paper
once,
handing
it
in,
and
getting
it
back
with
a
few
comments
and
a
grade.
My
mouth
dropped
to
the
floor
the
first
time
I
handed
in
a
draft
to
Professor
Lennertz
expecting
a
few
easy-to-make
corrections
only
to
have
it
returned
with
green
ink
and
comments
all
over.
Not
only
were
they
comments,
but
they
were
questions,
something
to
which
I
was
barely
familiar
to
seeing,
and
completely
aloof
to
answering.
By
this
I
mean
that
a
teacher
in
the
past
might
have
put
a
question
on
my
paper,
but
it
was
a
final
draft
so
I
never
actually
had
to
write
and
return
an
answer
to
him
or
her.
It
was
a
moot
issue.
I
had
never
seen
so
much
writing
on
my
papers,
even
with
Ms.
Giampetro.
The
difference
between
Professor
Lennertz
and
Ms.
Giampetro,
however,
is
that
as
each
paper
progressed
with
Professor
Lennertz,
I
actually
felt
my
writing
and
style
becoming
clearer,
more
definitive,
more
opinionated,
and
all-around
better.
It
became
easier
to
swallow
my
pride,
peruse
the
questions
and
comments
painted
like
artwork
in
green
ink,
and
ultimately
crumple
up
my
first
draft
that
I
had
spent
hours
on
to
write
a
stronger,
better
organized,
and
typically
longer,
paper.
The
culmination
of
my
efforts
with
Professor
Lennertz
in
Political
Humor
was
a
Supreme
Court
Simulation
Opinion
on
the
"State
v.
Vanderjaak."
After
many
hours
and
multiple
rewrites
I
produced
a
single-spaced,
1"
inch
margin,
12-pt
font,
8
page
opinion
with
the
strongest
arguments,
complex
theses,
and
logical
organization
than
I
had
ever
written
before.
I
believe
it
is
probably
one
of
maybe
two
of
the
most
scholarly
papers
I
have
ever
written.
Professor
Lennertz's
FYS
definitely
introduced
me
to
a
new
level
of
writing--not
only
"college
writing"
but
"well-crafted
writing."
At
the
same
time
I
was
toiling
away
in
Professor
Lennertz's
class
I
was
also
learning
a
new
type
of
writing
in
Ethics
class.
Professor
McLeod
introduced
his
papers
in
this
way:
"There
will
be
five
papers,
each
2-3
pages--but
they'll
be
the
most
difficult
and
intensive
2-3
page
papers
that
you
have
ever
written."
By
the
end
of
the
class,
I
both
agreed
and
disagreed.
I
agreed
because
before
his
class
I
always
wrote
in
a
somewhat
lengthy
and
at
times
flowery
style,
so
his
papers
challenged
me
to
get
rid
of
both
the
"garbage"
and
sometimes
relevant
(but
not
most
relevant)
points
in
my
writing.
The
simple
format,
however,
most
definitely
suited
me.
I
would
state
the
logical
argument
at
hand
in
list
form,
define
key
words
in
near-list
format,
and
then
defend
and
attack
the
argument.
To
this
end,
the
ethics
papers
might
be
described
as
a
type
of
lab
report,
with
a
set
format
and
logical
procedure--only
much
easier.
There
was
no
real
calculation,
but
your
argument
could
flow
clearly
and
concisely.
He
directed
us
to
write
no
introduction
and
no
conclusion,
so
I
never
felt
like
I
was
writing
"garbage."
I
always
felt
proud
of
the
papers
because
I
could
reread
them
and
see
so
much
put
into
so
little
a
space,
and
see
that
nearly
all
of
it
was
my
own
creation,
not
regurgitating
what
had
been
taught
to
us.
It
was
this--the
creation
of
"something"
from
"nothing"
by
my
own
mind,
building
on
the
thoughts
of
others,
or
by
striking
them
down--that
made
Owen
Mcleod's
class
my
favorite
last
year.
It
is
what
made
my
final
paper
for
his
class
the
most
fun,
challenging,
and
prominent
of
my
writings
ever.
I
have
never
been
prouder
of
a
piece
of
work
in
my
life,
which
is
a
large
honor
considering
that
this
paper
was
short--four
pages.
Our
assignment
was
to
create
a
new
ethical
theory,
and
it
took
me
almost
the
whole
week
before
I
wrote
it
to
think
and
prewrite.
I
developed
the
theory
of
"Virtue-Utilitarianism,"
combining
two
previous
theories
in
a
way
that
I
don't
think
has
ever
been
done
before.
I
have
tried
to
research
such
a
thing
on
the
Internet
after
writing
the
paper,
but
have
yet
to
find
anything
close.
The
"A+"
was
nice,
but
far
sweeter
was
that
McLeod,
ever
the
antagonist,
didn't
write
much
against
my
theory,
and
further
recommended
me
for
McKelvy
house.
I
owe
thanks
to
Professor
McLeod,
therefore,
not
only
for
a
great
class
experience
or
a
great
writing
and
thinking
experience
but
also
for
furthering
my
whole
college
experience,
as
I
will
be
in
McKelvy
House
next
semester.
My
most
recent
experiment
in
the
science
and
art
combination
we
deem
"writing"
was
also,
perhaps,
the
most
important
for
my
future.
I
called
the
animal
which
endured
my
numerous
metaphorical
pokes,
prods,
tweaks,
and
perchance
taunting
and
expletives,
"Resume."
Of
course
sometimes
I
probably
referred
to
it
as
"My
#@##-ing
Resume,"
but
for
now
I'll
just
say
"Resume."
That
term
for
me,
however,
describes
not
only
that
one
piece
of
paper
that
describes
my
previous
work
and
activities,
but
the
far
more
difficult
"Cover
Letter."
Let
me
just
begin
by
saying
that,
like
this
choice
7
page
assignment
I
am
in
the
process
of
writing,
the
Cover
Letter
requires
one
to
write
about
himself,
something
that
I
absolutely
HATE
doing
directly.
Indirectly
in
the
form
of
poems
or
stories
I
can
handle,
but
directly
writing
an
autobiographical
type
do-ma-job-y
I
hate.
I
think
I
simply
find
myself
boring.
That
aside,
it
is
exponentially
more
difficult
for
me
to
write
something
that
is
supposed
to
be
what
I
consider
to
be
the
cockiest
statement
possible:
I
am
great,
I
am
the
best
person
for
your
position,
hire
me.
What
a
ridiculous
requirement.
I'm
sorry
but
I
am
one
of
those
people
who
needs
to
be
liked,
and
I
want
my
potential
employer
to
hire
someone
they
will
like--I
cannot
begin
to
imagine
how
any
of
those
Cover
Letters
can
both
in
essence
brag
and
be
likeable.
More
comical
is
the
Cover
Letter
for
an
internship,
because
you
and
the
employer
both
know
that
the
employer
has
a
greater
chance
of
being
of
use
to
you
than
you
do
to
the
employer,
and
yet
you
have
to
tell
him
why
you
will
be
of
such
great
import
to
the
office.
Well,
I
did
my
Cover
Letters
and
Resume
and
landed
an
internship
with
the
Montgomery
County
District
Attorney's
office
in
Pennsylvania.
My
Resume
may
have
been
"impressive,"
but
how
did
I
really
get
the
shot
at
the
job,
which
slipped
through
the
hands
of
hundreds
of
other
students?
A
recommendation
by
a
well
respected
ex-Montgomery
County-DA
and
Lafayette
alum
(who
is
the
one
who
called
my
paper
impressive
in
the
first
place)
did
the
trick.
There's
a
life
lesson--but
don't
all
experiences
in
writing
serve
as,
or
lead
to,
life
lessons?
Not
exactly.
