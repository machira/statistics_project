My
Literacy
Narrative
I
would
like
to
think
that
I
was
a
natural
writer.
It
would
have
been
nice,
if
by
some
strange
occurrence
I
popped
directly
from
my
mother's
womb
capable
of
writing
with
skill
of
Tolstoy
or
Whitman.
Perhaps,
with
a
silver
pen
in
my
mouth.
Unfortunately,
that
has
not
been
the
case.
My
growth
as
writer
has
come
in
fits
and
starts.
While
I
have
succeeded,
my
quest
to
become
a
good
writer
can
only
be
expressed
in
the
words
of
Tom
Cruise
in
Top
Gun
when
he
said:
"I
crashed
and
burned
the
first
time
around."
The
first
writing
experiences
that
I
can
remember
were
the
assignments
of
first
grade.
I
was
given
huge
sheets
of
paper
that
covered
my
entire
desk.
Despite
its
size,
the
paper
had,
maybe,
six
actual
lines
to
write
on.
Looking
back
on
those
lines
today,
I
realize
that
I
could
write
an
entire
essay
within
the
space
of
one
of
those
single
lines.
Despite
my
condescending
attitude
now,
those
big
spaces
had
value.
Between
the
blue,
solid
lines
that
denoted
the
top
and
bottom,
was
a
single
dotted
line.
Ostensibly,
this
line
was
remind
me,
the
writer
in
training,
to
keep
my
lower
case
letters
small
(below
the
dotted
line)
and
my
capital
letters
big
(filling
the
entire
space
between
the
solid
lines).
However,
the
image
of
the
two
solid
lines
with
a
dotted
line
in
between
struck
me
as
being
a
road.
So
I
imagined
my
hand
to
be
a
car
which
left
all
sorts
of
very
elaborate
skid
marks
over
the
paper.
So
while
I
occasionally
cracked
my
pencil
tip,
or
tore
my
paper
with
the
force
of
a
sudden
swerve
,
I
probably
had
my
first
positive
writing
experience
as
I
saw
it
as
a
fun
task
to
be
completed.
It
was
not
long
after
learning
to
write
that
I
had
my
first
negative
writing
experience.
Upon
entering
the
third
grade,
I
was
told
that
we
could
no
longer
print,
but
instead
had
to
learn
something
called
Cursive
Writing
.
So
on
the
first
day
of
lessons,
I
once
again
labored
to
create
letters
in
the
huge
lines
as
I
had
done
two
years
before.
But
as
Mrs.
Storm
walked
down
the
row
of
desks,
complementing
my
fellow
students
on
their
effort.
Upon
reaching
my
desk
though,
she
suddenly
shouted,
Christopher,
you
don't
write
like
THAT
do
you
!!!
.
The
THAT
she
was
referring
to,
was
the
way
in
which
I
held
my
pencil.
Over
the
course
of
the
past
two
or
more
years
my
classmates
had
all
learned
to
write
in
the
appropriate
manner,
pencil
gently
clasped
between
the
index
and
middle
finger
and
the
thumb.
I,
on
the
other
hand,
had
a
veritable
death
grip
in
the
pencil,
clutching
it
between
my
ring
and
middle
fingers
and
my
thumb,
while
my
index
finger
rested
unused.
From
that
point
on
Mrs.
Storm
tried
to
later
my
strange
grip.
Her
methods
of
persuasion
varied
from
syrupy,
vanilla
kindness,
to
a
strange
Gestapo-like
technique
of
binding
my
hand
(in
the
proper
position)
to
the
pencil
using
rubber
bands.
It
was
a
battle
that
made
every
writing
assignment
frustrating
for
me.
While
most
everyone
else
in
my
class
was
able
to
complete
their
writing
exercises
and
head
outside
for
extra
recess,
I
was
left
inside
to
fight
my
awkwardness.
By
the
end
of
the
year
both
Mrs.
Storm
and
I
had
failed.
She
failed
to
get
me
to
change
my
grip,
and
I
accordingly
failed
the
writing
section
of
third
grade.
While
my
failure
in
third
grade
did
not
stunt
my
intellectual
growth,
it
is
telling
of
what
I
thought
good
writing
was.
In
those
early
years,
a
good
writer
was
someone
like
my
classmate
Lauren.
Her
handwriting
was
perfect.
It
was
a
curvy
and
smooth
line
that
flowed
effortlessly
from
her
pen.
Her
lower
case
letters
never
strayed
beyond
the
dotted
line,
and
every
i
was
primly
dotted
with
a
heart.
Her
proficiency
at
forming
letters
made
her
Mrs.
Storm's
favorite,
and
my
antithesis.
Looking
back
it
seems
funny,
but
I
thought
all
it
took
to
be
a
great
writer
was
superb
penmanship.
My
imaging
my
hand
to
be
a
car,
was
just
an
extension
of
my
notion
of
a
purely
mechanical
writing
process.
Over
time
though,
forming
words
became
crafting
sentences,
then
assembling
paragraphs,
and
then
drafting
full
papers.
While
I
did
many
insignificant
book
reports,
and
small
presentations,
it
was
in
Mrs.
Rinaldi's
seventh
grade
social
studies
class
that
I
first
did
what
I
thought
was
a
"real"
report.
I
still
vividly
remember
how
horrified
I
was
on
the
first
day
of
class
when
she
told
us
we
would
be
writing
six
"focus
country"
reports.
She
then
went
on
how
these
were
to
be
"real"
reports,
about
an
individual
countries
of
our
choosing.
What
really
made
me
sweat
though
was
how
we
had
to
have
strange
things
like
sources
and
a
bibliography.
For
that
reason,
I
found
myself
pouring
over
the
World
Almanac
and
the
Encyclopedia
Britannaca,
dutifully
noting
West
Germany's
gross
national
product,
or
the
average
age
of
the
population
of
Libya.
I
would
then
string
these
random
numbers
and
percentages
into
a
few
seemingly
coherent
paragraphs,
and
then
list
my
sources.
Each
time
I
would
receive
my
report
back
covered
with
a
multiplicity
of
checks
and
a
comment
like
"Super
Job,
!!!!",
and
I
inevitably
think
how
easy
it
was
to
write
a
"real"
report.
In
retrospect,
I
was
merely
enacting
the
role
of
a
eighteenth
or
nineteenth
century
scribe.
I
would
copy
or
"paraphrase"(I
had
no
idea
what
that
meant)
an
assortment
of
facts
and
figures
and
present
them
to
my
teacher.
I
must
admit
too,
that
I
really
thought
that
transcribing
these
facts
had
meaning
and
that
they
were
some
how
more
than
just
the
dry
as
dust
numbers
that
they
were.
Consequently,
while
the
vocabulary
and
structure
improved
with
each
grade,
the
genuine
content
of
my
writing
really
did
not.
This
fatal
flaw
became
evident
in
my
tenth
grade
English
class.
I
turned
in
what
I
thought
was
a
perfect
paper
on
Mary
Shelly's
Frankenstein,
and
received
it
back
looking
as
if
it
had
been
attacked
by
a
red
pen
wielding
Zorro.
After
each
paragraph
was
the
grim
epithet
"SO
????",
and
on
the
final
page
was
a
note
that
read
"Chris,
please
talk
to
me
after
class,
Mrs.
Cook.".
Full
of
righteous
anger,
I
went
to
talk
to
her
after
class
determined
to
defend
my
cherished
writing
to
the
death.
After
vehemently
arguing
that
I
had
described
the
book
perfectly
she
said,
"That's
the
problem
Chris".
She
went
on
to
explain
that
I
did
in
fact
give
her
an
excellent
plot
summary
of
the
book,
but
the
problem
was
she
had
already
read
the
book,
several
times
in
fact.
It
took
her
some
time,
but
she
explained
to
me
that
she
wanted
the
"why"
not
the
"what"
of
the
book.
She
repeatedly
said
things
like,
"Well
WHY,
is
that
instance
of
the
monster
seeing
himself
for
the
first
time
important
?".
Mrs.
Cook
then
handed
me
back
my
paper,
and
said
"Now
try
it
again."
So
I
did
try
again
...
and
again
...
and
again.
My
Frankenstein
paper
was
a
genuine
literary
monster.
It
had
strange
appendages
of
insight
sporadically
attached
to
plot
summary,
and
vise
versa.
It
was
probably
the
most
generously
awarded
C+
in
the
entire
history
of
teaching
the
English
language.
Despite
this
feeling,
I
learned
the
most
important
lesson
of
my
writing
career:
content
is
king.
So
unlike
the
ill-fated
Dr.
Frankenstein
I
continued
to
create
monsters.
Each
time
I
wrote
a
paper
I
would
methodically
chant
"What
is
the
WHY
???".
I
learned
slowly,
but
each
paper
did
get
better.
I
looked
deeper
into
the
text
for
more
meaning
with
each
draft,
while
I
continually
edited
out
large
chunks
of
plot
summary
that
I
had
slipped
into
previous
drafts.
It
was
a
two
year
process
in
which
I
wrote
some
great
papers,
some
average
papers,
and
some
absolutely
terrible
papers.
The
culmination,
of
this
effort,
was
a
paper
I
wrote
on
the
Tonkin
Gulf
incident
and
its
after
effects
on
US
foreign
and
domestic
policy.
When
it
was
done,
I
had
twenty-two
pages
and
a
huge
bibliography.
Not
only
was
it
long,
but
it
had
the
proverbial
"content"
I
had
craved.
I
was
eventually
asked
to
present
the
paper
at
the
Honors
Colloquium,
in
which
the
best
student
work
of
the
academic
year
was
presented.
As
I
read
the
paper,
and
saw
my
teachers
and
friends
nod
at
the
arguments
I
made,
I
felt
that
I
had
created
something
truly
my
own.
It
was
perhaps
the
best
feeling
I
had
in
my
high
school
career.
Despite
my
writing
in
college
for
the
past
two
years,
I
still
look
upon
that
paper
as
something
special.
Not
because
I
haven't
written
anything
better,
but
because
that
was
the
first
paper
that
I
can
point
to
and
say
with
pride,
"I
wrote
that."
Today
I
write
papers
without
much
of
the
distress
that
I
felt
before.
While
I
still
get
confused,
angry,
and
stressed
occasionally,
I
do
not
feel
the
utter
mental
paralysis
that
I
felt
after
Mrs.
Cook
told
me
to
write
about
the
"why".
Over
all,
one
can
say
that
while
I
have
grown
up,
my
writing
did
the
same.
In
my
early
years
I
was
only
concerned
with
understanding
the
process
of
forming
words
and
sentences.
This
focus
on
the
task
is
somewhat
similar
to
how
simply
a
child
sees
the
world.
As
my
life
grew
increasingly
more
and
more
complex,
my
writing
was
forced
to
evolve.
Now
as
a
young
adult,
I
feel
that
while
I
have
certainly
not
mastered
the
art
of
writing,
I
have
at
least
found
a
successful
way
of
doing
it.
And
here
again
I
find
meaning
in
Top
Gun.
After
Kelly
Macgillis
asks
what
happened
after
he
crashed
and
burned
the
first
time,
Tom
Cruise
replies,
"
I
am
working
on
it."
Yeah
Tom,
so
am
I.
