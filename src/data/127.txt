To
Criticize
is
Human,
But
to
Encourage
is
Divine

Writing
Workshop

Tiernan

August
1997
My
first
recollection
of
writing
dates
back
to
the
days
of
kindergarten.
Having
mastered
printing
the
letter
h
in
school,
I
proudly
demonstrated
my
new
found
love
of
the
written
language
by
scribbling
the
aforementioned
letter
across
the
walls
of
my
house
with
a
red
marker
that
I
had
procured
from
my
older
sister's
book
bag.
My
parents
did
not
share
my
sense
of
enthusiasm,
to
say
the
least.
Thus
began
my
experiences
with
the
process
of
writing,
and
with
the
aggravation
of
negative
criticism.
In
the
first
grade,
with
the
use
of
a
thick
pencil
and
wide
lined,
light
green
paper,
I
learned
to
print
the
remaining
twenty
five
letters
(both
in
upper
and
lower
case).
From
this
point,
it
was
but
a
simple
matter
to
grasp
the
concepts
of
the
noun,
verb,
adjective,
adverb,
gerund,
phrase,
and
clause.
Well,
perhaps
I
am
getting
ahead
of
myself.
The
actual
act
of
writing
did
not
come
easily.
Images
of
triangular,
rubber
pencil
grips
reeking
of
conformity
still
comprise
a
large
portion
of
my
academic
nightmares.
To
this
day,
I
continually
receive
criticism
regarding
my
unique
approach
to
pencil
holding.
Furthermore,
few,
if
any,
of
my
teachers
shared
my
view
concerning
the
superiority
of
left
handers.
One
of
my
religious
education
teachers
actually
muttered
something
about
a
sign
of
Satan.
If
my
parents
had
been
less
than
encouraging
in
my
early
stages
of
writing,
they
dutifully
overcompensated
for
it
later.
Since
the
time
that
I
could
print
coherent
sentences,
my
parents
insisted
that
I
write
thank
you
notes
to
all
of
my
friends
and
relatives
for
birthday
and
Christmas
gifts.
I
hated
writing
those
notes
as
a
young
boy
and
generally
dislike
writing
them
now.
Fortunately,
I
developed
a
structured
format
to
reduce
the
time
and
effort
needed
to
complete
the
letters.
The
format
consisted
of
four
parts:
thanking
the
person
for
the
gift,
describing
how
much
I
use
the
gift,
asking
how
the
person
was
doing,
and
wishing
them
luck
until
I
saw
them
again.
The
format
was
flexible
to
add
more
or
less
detail
depending
on
the
quality
of
the
gift.
Generally,
better
gifts
inspired
better
letters.
My
thank
you
letters
today,
although
usually
more
elaborate
than
those
of
my
youth,
follow
the
same
basic
form.
Writing
these
notes
taught
me
an
invaluable
lesson,
namely,
to
stay
with
what
works.
The
second
grade
introduced
me
to
the
art
of
cursive
writing.
Unfortunately,
it
also
delivered
a
crushing
blow
to
all
desire
to
express
my
creativity
in
the
written
language.
From
the
beginning,
I
have
always
performed
better
in
mathematics
and
science
than
in
the
subjects
of
English
and
history.
I
generally
took
little
interest
in
the
assignments
of
the
latter
subjects.
One
project,
however,
sparked
my
creativity.
My
class
was
to
write
a
very
short
story
describing
an
adventure
in
an
exotic
place.
The
story
was
to
be
written
on
large
piece
of
paper
with
lines
on
the
bottom
half.
We
were
instructed
to
draw
a
picture
of
the
story
in
the
blank
top
half
of
the
paper.
Inspired
by
I
know
not
what,
I
began
writing
a
fantastic
story
of
a
young
boy
landing
on
Mars
who,
after
discovering
bloodthirsty
Martians
and
their
diabolic
plot
to
conquer
Earth,
single-handedly
infiltrated
their
base
of
operations,
destroyed
their
entire
computer
weapons
systems,
and
saved
planet
Earth.
The
illustrations
depicted
scenes
of
wondrous
buildings,
hideous
aliens,
as
well
as
an
amazing
laser
gun
fire
fight
to
rival
that
of
Star
Wars.
At
the
time,
I
had
never
written
anything
like
it.
Completed,
the
story
spanned
four
pages
front
and
back.
When
I
turned
the
story
in,
I
expected
not
only
a
superior
grade,
but
perhaps
even
recognition
before
my
class
and
parents.
The
rest
of
the
students
wrote
lame
half
page
stories
about
traveling
to
Florida
and
saving
a
whale.
Incidentally,
I
heard
somewhere
that
one
of
those
stories
inspired
the
equally
lifeless
Free
Willy
movies.
The
returned
paper
carried
no
marks
of
recognition
except
a
large
letter
B
.
Rather
disappointed,
I
resolved
to
focus
on
math
and
science
and
leave
creativity
to
girls.
Only
many
years
later
did
I
recover
a
sense
of
joy
at
creative
writing.
The
third
grade
marked
the
major
transition
from
pencil
to
pen.
The
public
school
system
had
conveyed
a
symbolic
message:
Mistakes
would
no
longer
be
tolerated.
The
lines
of
the
paper
became
smaller
and
smaller,
as
the
amount
of
work
grew
larger
and
larger.
My
third
grade
teacher
usually
required
research
papers
and
reactions
to
class
readings.
Once
in
a
while
she
asked
the
students
to
compose
a
poem
or
short
story.
She
may
have
explained
the
genres
of
writing,
but
I
do
not
recall.
As
previously
mentioned,
my
interest
in
writing
had
significantly
dwindled.
Both
the
fourth
and
fifth
grade
continued
the
routine
of
reading
and
writing.
These
grades
focused
more
on
grammar
than
the
previous
grades.
I
can
only
recall
two
incidents
as
noteworthy
to
my
writing
history.
In
the
fourth
grade,
my
teacher
gave
me
a
very
severe
verbal
lashing
for
falling
behind
in
my
reading
and
writing.
Without
exaggerating,
it
would
have
brought
a
lesser
child
to
tears
for
she
was
a
large
and
very
emotional
woman.
She
threatened
to
have
me
dropped
from
the
highest
reading
level,
as
if
I
cared,
but
to
hear
her
someone
would
think
that
she
was
threatening
my
life.
The
public
school
system
had
graciously
given
me
yet
another
reason
to
concentrate
on
math
and
science.
My
fifth
grade
teacher
was
both
friendly
and
encouraging,
in
critiquing
our
writing
as
well
as
everything
else.
I
specifically
remember
her
commenting
that
I
had
the
nicest
handwriting
that
she'd
ever
seen.
Years
later,
to
my
total
surprise
and
chagrin,
I
discovered
that
the
majority
of
my
class
had
heard
the
same
praise.
Nevertheless,
she
had
started
to
renew
my
interest
in
writing
which
would
grow
in
time.
The
final
year
of
elementary
school
rejuvenated
my
creativity.
Much
of
this
desire
stemmed
from
my
growing
interest
in
reading
fiction.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
was
reading
on
a
regular
basis
for
entertainment.
Realizing
the
limitless
possibilities
of
fiction
writing,
I
now
saw
the
importance
of
the
written
language.
I
tried
experimenting
with
different
types
of
styles
and
genres.
The
paper
that
I
remember
best
was
a
one
page
essay
describing
my
favorite
supermarket.
Although
I
did
not
have
a
favorite
supermarket,
I
hated
a
nearby
supermarket
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
So,
without
knowing
the
meaning
of
the
word
satire,
I
ridiculed
the
supermarket's
flaws
in
my
paper.
One
sentence
read,
When
they
are
not
on
strike,
the
employees
can
be
quite
friendly.
It
was
my
first,
and
according
to
one
teacher
my
last,
successful
attempt
at
humor
in
the
written
form.
Fortunately,
over
the
next
six
years
of
public
schooling,
I
was
blessed
with
some
exceptional
English
teachers.
This
set
of
teachers,
combined
with
my
love
of
reading,
did
more
than
any
other
factor
to
enhance
my
writing
ability.
Additionally,
writing
was
now
required
a
great
deal
more
in
the
other
subjects.
As
I
have
mentioned,
I
was
not
a
natural
at
English,
and,
throughout
high
school,
it
was
the
only
class
that
I
consistently
failed
to
ace.
Nevertheless,
it
continued
to
be
my
favorite
class
and
I
worked
to
become
a
better
writer.
In
the
ninth
grade,
the
positive
feedback
from
my
teacher
encouraged
me
to
try
different
approaches
to
writing.
Specifically,
I
remember
writing
a
rather
clever
ending
to
a
story
that
we
had
read
in
class
and
a
parody
of
a
Sherlock
Holmes
detective
story.
Two
exercises
that
my
teacher
used
to
develop
writing
skills
particularly
impressed
me.
The
first
consisted
of
writing
a
spontaneous
short
story
based
on
a
photograph
that
he
would
show
us
for
one
minute.
The
second
required
the
students
to
write
continuously
for
five
minutes
in
response
to
a
statement
that
he
would
make.
Ninth
grade
also
marked
the
first
time
that
students
critiqued
each
others
papers.
Contrary
to
my
original
notion,
I
found
that
such
measures
helped
my
papers
and
my
understanding
of
the
writing
process.
I
completed
my
first
real
research
paper
that
year.
The
science
and
English
teachers
concocted
a
devious
project
to
challenge
both
comprehension
of
biology
and
writing
skill.
The
paper,
a
minimum
of
ten
typed
pages,
accounted
for
one
quarter
of
the
semester
grade
in
each
class.
Up
until
this
point,
I
had
handwritten
almost
all
of
my
reports.
The
very
few
that
needed
to
be
typed
were
done
so
by
my
loving
mother.
I
myself
knew
not
how
to
type.
I
finished
writing
the
paper
at
ten
p.m.
the
night
before
it
was
due.
Not
wanting
to
explain
to
my
mother
that
I
had
waited
until
the
last
minute
and
that
I
needed
her
to
type
over
ten
pages
by
tomorrow
morning,
I
woke
up
at
three
a.m.
and
typed
for
my
first
time
on
an
antique
typewriter
until
sunrise.
The
experience
taught
me
well
the
folly
of
procrastination.
In
the
tenth
grade
I
learned
the
basic,
five
paragraph
format
for
writing
essays.
The
first
paragraph
describes
the
topic
of
the
essay
and
introduces
the
thesis
statement.
The
next
three
paragraphs
provide
major
supporting
arguments
of
the
thesis.
Within
each
paragraph
are
specific
examples
to
support
each
of
the
major
arguments.
The
final
paragraph
concludes
the
essay
by
elaborating
on
the
thesis
statement.
I
successfully
used
this
format
for
the
majority
of
my
high
school
essays.
While
it
provided
a
solid
foundation
for
clear,
logical
writing,
the
format
required
serious
alterations
upon
my
arrival
at
college.
The
following
summer,
I
spent
two
weeks
in
western
Maryland
fixing
houses
for
the
homeless.
During
the
two
weeks,
I
kept
a
journal
of
my
experiences
and
impressions.
The
journal
expanded
my
individual
writing
style
and
revealed
to
me
the
joy
of
capturing
personal
thoughts
and
preserving
them
for
later
reflection.
Unlike
my
high
school
essays,
in
the
journal
I
actually
wrote
exactly
what
I
thought
without
fear
of
retribution.
Those
two
weeks
contained
some
of
the
most
worthwhile
experiences
of
my
life,
and
writing
the
journal
was
not
least
among
them.
The
next
two
years
continued
to
develop
my
skill
and
my
interest
in
writing.
My
English
class
focused
a
great
deal
on
poetry
in
the
eleventh
grade.
Not
only
did
we
have
to
analyze
this
strange,
new
form
of
language,
but
we
in
fact
had
to
create
our
own
pieces.
The
twelfth
grade
consisted
of
more
analysis
and
reaction
writing.
In
the
twelfth
grade
I
met
the
minions
of
hell
in
the
\
form
of
college
applications.
A
hectic
year
indeed,
but
I
managed
to
save
my
soul,
get
accepted
into
college,
and
learn
something
about
the
art
of
exaggeration
in
the
process.
My
only
concern
about
writing
at
the
college
level
dealt
with
the
lengths
of
papers.
In
high
school,
I
had
written
countless
three
to
five
page
hand
written
essays
and
believed
them
to
be
adequate
preparation
for
short
college
essays.
What
worried
me
was
formulating
enough
ideas
and
maintaining
decent
structure
for
longer
essays.
My
experience
greatly
lacked
in
this
area.
My
predictions
concerning
the
difficulties
of
writing
longer
essays
proved
correct.
At
first,
I
tried
simply
to
incorporate
more
examples
to
support
my
arguments.
When
this
failed,
and
it
did,
my
professor
instructed
me
to
limit
my
paper
to
a
few
good
examples
and
focus
in
depth
on
them.
I
have
been
following
this
advice
and
have
seen
significant
improvements
in
my
papers
ever
since.
My
experiences
at
Lafayette
have
noticeably
enhanced
my
writing
ability.
The
frequency
of
writing
papers
in
a
variety
of
subjects,
combined
with
the
advice
of
a
number
of
professors,
has
generated
this
development.
I
now
type
all
of
my
papers
on
computer,
complete
with
formatting
and
spell
check.
I
feel
that
I
have
matured,
if
only
a
little,
from
that
young
boy
with
a
red
marker
in
his
hand
and
a
huge
grin
on
his
face.
The
desire
to
improve
my
writing
continues
to
motivate
me
from
the
courses
that
I
select
to
the
future
careers
that
I
consider.
