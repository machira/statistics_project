My
History
as
a
Writer
Nostalgia
envelopes
me,
but
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
remembrance
does
not.
Early
experiences
as
a
writer
escape
my
memory
except
for
the
rather
fat
green
pencils
I
used.
I
also
remember
that
the
paper
I
was
given
had
the
appearance
of
recycled
paper
as
it
was
grayish
in
color
and
of
low
quality.
One
thing
I
can
recall
about
learning
to
write
was
that
I
wrote
my
name-
Lucinda
Brolin-
quite
proudly
and
largely
on
the
wide
lined
paper.
Later,
because
of
much
teasing,
in
about
mid-first
grade,
I
began
to
despise
my
given
name
and
print
-Cindy-
more
humbly.
This
was
probably
the
first
time
that
what
and
how
I
wrote
was
affected
by
the
opinions
of
others.
The
way
I
wrote
and
still
write
is
a
result
of
all
the
feedback
I
have
received
for
my
writing
from
professors
and
friends.
The
subject
matter
for
all
my
writing
was
pretty
much
dictated
by
the
professors,
as
was
the
writing
style
Until
high
school.

fostered
free

Mr

We
were

Yet
the
seemingly
terrific
part
about
all
this
was
that
he
allowed
us
to
create
our
own
schedule
of
due
dates
for.
each
one.
The
schedule
had
to
be
cleared
with
him
before
we
would
begin*
but
then
the
rest
was
up
to
us.
No
