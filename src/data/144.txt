Literacy
Narrative
As
I
enter
my
senior
year
at
Lafayette
College,
I
am
also
beginning
my
third
and
final
year
as
a
writing
associate.
Both
the
variety
of
my
experiences
as
a
WA
and
my
writing
grew
junior
year.
Through
an
economics
class
I
was
immersed
in
an
unfamiliar
area
of
fairly
technical
writing.
Meanwhile,
I
continued
to
write
the
all
too
familiar
research
papers
for
my
classes
in
history
and
government.
In
writing
I
continued
to
apply
the
same
techniques
I
have
discussed
countless
times
in
WA
conferences:
how
to
make
a
strong
thesis,
how
to
organize
ideas
well,
learning
when
to
paraphrase
and
when
to
quote,
and
watching
common
grammar
mistakes.
However,
in
many
ways
I
do
not
believe
that
the
quality
of
my
writing
changed
significantly
over
the
course
of
the
past
year.
What
did
change
significantly
was
the
depth
of
my
interactions
with
students
in
the
WA
conferences.
Communication
between
the
writer
and
the
WA
is
integral
to
having
a
successful
meeting.
I
found
out
very
early
in
September
of
both
my
sophomore
and
junior
years
just
how
important
all
aspects
of
communication
are
to
the
writing
process,
even
when
you
are
your
own
peer
reviewer.
While
my
writing
last
year
exhibited
some
of
the
same
problems
present
in
the
papers
of
many
students
I
talked
to
in
WA
conferences,
what
I
learned
about
the
role
of
communication
in
the
writing
process
continued
to
vary.
During
my
first
year
as
a
WA
I
encountered
an
international
student
in
a
First
Year
Seminar
who
neither
read
nor
spoke
English
well.
This
introduced
a
situation
for
which
I
had
never
been
prepared.
My
role
as
a
writing
associate
diminished
because
the
student
was
not
able
to
write
English
well
enough
to
construct
a
logical
and
clear
paper.
However,
the
peer
advocate
side
of
my
job
as
a
WA
developed
as
I
directed
the
student
to
the
services
of
English
as
a
Second
Language.
In
addition
close
interaction
with
the
professor
of
the
class
became
increasingly
necessary
under
those
circumstances.
During
my
second
year
as
a
WA,
again
I
encountered
a
situation
where
my
role
as
a
peer
advocate
outweighed
my
role
as
a
writing
associate.
One
of
my
first
conferences
of
the
year
was
starting
out
poorly.
The
student
showed
up
fifteen
minutes
late
having
confused
the
time
of
our
meeting.
Furthermore,
her
paper
was
a
mess.
My
first
impression
when
I
read
the
paper
the
night
before
our
meeting
was
that
the
student
wrote
the
paper
at
the
last
minute
and
did
not
put
forth
any
real
effort.
The
paper
was
on
the
role
of
art
in
Russia,
but
it
lacked
any
focus
and
was
riddled
with
grammatical
mistakes
that
rendered
it
incomprehensible.
It
was
unclear
based
on
sentence
structure
what
was
the
beginning
and
what
was
the
end.
I
was
unable
to
tell
what
pages
followed
each
other
because
ideas
seemed
to
be
randomly
thrown
on
the
page.
Just
as
I
was
about
to
leave
the
student
showed
up
and
I
decided
to
make
the
best
of
the
time
we
had
left.
As
I
described
ways
to
give
the
paper
a
focus
and
make
it
stronger,
I
found
the
student
to
be
unresponsive.
She
buried
her
head
in
her
arms
on
the
table
and
seemed
to
be
mortified
by
the
entire
process.
Something
made
me
stop
and
take
a
good
long
look
at
the
young
woman
sitting
next
to
me.
At
that
point
the
purpose
of
the
conference
shifted.
After
some
prodding
the
student
confided
that
she
had
a
learning
disability
which
made
it
hard
for
her
to
read
and
write
quickly.
She
found
it
hard
to
take
notes
in
class
and
researching
her
topic
was
very
tedious.
I
went
with
the
student
to
see
some
of
her
professors
and
to
the
Dean's
Office.
Even
though
I
never
read
a
strong
draft
from
the
student,
I
had
learned
another
valuable
lesson
about
being
a
writing
associate.
For
the
second
time
I
had
had
to
act
as
a
peer
advocate,
and
I
had
to
rely
on
conversation
not
solely
based
on
the
paper
in
front
of
me.
I
had
to
probe
into
a
student's
entire
writing
process
in
the
hopes
of
building
a
bridge
to
a
middle
ground.
From
then
on,
every
time
I
read
the
paper
of
a
student
I
did
not
yet
know
anything
about,
I
did
not
make
assumptions
about
the
conditions
under
which
the
student
wrote.
I
have
found
that
for
any
one
instance
in
which
a
student
did
not
write
a
paper
out
of
sheer
laziness,
there
was
another
student
who
had
a
legitimate
reason
why
their
draft
did
not
accurately
represent
their
writing
skills.
Communication
with
students
as
to
how
they
view
the
writing
and
researching
process
sometimes
takes
a
lot
of
time.
However,
I
have
found
that
unless
a
strong
attempt
is
made
to
understand
where
the
student
is
coming
from,
neither
one
of
us
gains
as
much
from
the
conference
as
we
could.
Each
individual
has
his
own
writing
history.
Every
time
I
begin
a
conference
with
someone
new
I
try
to
think
of
the
meeting
as
an
introduction
into
their
writing
history.
While
the
draft
of
their
paper
is
my
first
formal
experience
with
this
history,
it
is
not
the
writer's
entire
history
and
so
should
not
be
treated
as
such.
By
asking
the
writer
questions
and
asking
her
to
explain
her
ideas,
she
retains
a
measure
of
control
over
the
conference.
I
have
found
that
when
students
feel
empowered
and
comfortable
in
a
conference,
they
are
more
likely
to
share
their
true
anxieties
about
the
work
at
hand
and
their
overall
writing
process.
That
in
itself
constitutes
a
successful
conference
from
my
point
of
view.
First,
the
student
is
comfortable
asking
important
questions
about
her
work.
Second,
she
is
more
likely
to
integrate
the
new
ideas
and
techniques
into
both
her
work
and
her
total
writing
process.
Third,
the
student
is
more
likely
to
show
up
at
her
next
scheduled
conference
if
she
feels
there
is
something
to
be
gained.
The
communication
process
which
I
believe
is
just
as
important
as
the
actual
process
of
writing
is
something
I
hope
to
build
on
in
the
coming
year.
A
form
of
communication
exists
even
when
an
individual
is
her
own
WA.
To
write
effectively
a
person
must
be
able
to
step
back
from
her
work
and
question
it
the
way
a
reader
might.
She
must
ask
herself
the
same
questions
that
would
be
asked
of
her
in
a
WA
conference.
In
this
manner,
a
dialogue
is
maintained
throughout
the
brainstorming,
writing,
and
revising
process.
Recently,
I
have
had
to
reflect
upon
how
strong
this
internal
dialogue
was
as
a
part
of
my
writing
process
during
the
past
year.
A
famous
American
diplomat
once
wrote
in
a
letter
I
would
have
written
a
shorter
letter
if
I'd
only
had
the
time.
Due
to
my
writing
experiences
throughout
the
past
year
my
variation
of
that
quote
would
be,
I
would
have
written
a
better
developed,
more
concise
and
tighter
paper
with
fewer
simple
grammar
mistakes
if
I'd
only
had
more
coffee.
The
bulk
of
the
writing
I
did
junior
year
was
done
second
semester.
I
juggled
constant
research
and
writing
in
four
out
of
five
classes;
in
one
class
I
had
to
analyze
and
concisely
explain
ideas
in
a
new
writing
discipline.
In
my
economics
class
I
had
to
research
the
large
scale
economic
policies
of
a
specific
Latin
American
country.
In
addition,
I
frequently
wrote
short
papers
in
which
I
analyzed
the
implications
of
the
economic
policies
in
place
at
various
times
in
a
particular
nation's
history.
Never
before
did
I
have
to
digest
such
complex
material
in
a
short
amount
of
time,
while
at
the
same
time
presenting
the
material
in
a
manner
easily
accessible
to
any
reader.
While
I
enjoyed
the
challenge
of
a
more
technical
and
less
abstract
form
of
writing,
I
was
not
able
to
fully
adapt
to
the
style
of
writing
until
the
end
of
the
semester.
At
times
I
suffered
from
the
same
problems
I
point
out
to
students
in
WA
conferences.
Some
of
those
problems
were
the
need
for
better
organization,
the
need
to
concisely
state
the
thesis,
and
simple
grammatical
mistakes
such
as
subject
and
verb
agreement.
After
getting
back
my
papers
I
would
look
at
the
comments
and
a
strange
feeling
of
deja
vu
set
in.
While
I
knew
I
had
made
simple
mistakes,
I
felt
like
I
was
the
student
at
the
WA
conference
and
not
the
writing
associate.
Each
time
I
was
given
back
an
assignment
the
same
thoughts
went
through
my
head.
Overall
the
papers
were
acceptable,
but
how
come
I
did
not
catch
many
mistakes
even
though
I
proofread
the
paper
at
least
three
times?
Have
my
writing
skills
degenerated
over
the
past
year?
When
I
took
a
step
back
and
analyzed
my
writing
process
I
saw
two
big
flaws:
I
had
not
drank
enough
coffee
and
I
was
not
continuing
a
dialogue
in
my
writing
process.
As
a
result
of
my
experiences
with
the
student
who
had
a
learning
disability
I
learned
that
I
cannot
make
assumptions
about
anyone's
writing,
including
my
own.
Throughout
the
year
I
expended
so
much
energy
in
a
variety
of
activities,
that
I
it
was
not
until
the
end
of
the
school
year
and
the
beginning
of
the
summer
that
I
was
able
to
take
a
hard
look
at
the
direction
my
writing
was
taking.
Only
then
did
I
begin
to
understand
why
my
papers
written
junior
year
did
not
take
shape
as
planned.
I
have
found
that
due
to
class
schedules,
the
demands
of
campus
jobs
(such
as
being
a
WA),
and
the
other
rigors
of
campus
life,
many
papers
do
not
begin
to
take
shape
until
9:30
or
10
pm.
I
have
always
believed
that
my
brain
is
the
least
cluttered
and
the
most
receptive
to
writing
at
night.
Moreover,
I
never
write
papers
the
night
before
they
are
due
because
I
always
want
at
least
one
day
to
look
over
the
paper
and
make
any
corrections.
Nevertheless,
I
found
that
as
second
semester
wore
on,
the
length
of
time
I
had
to
be
a
WA
for
each
paper
shrank
considerably.
Instead
of
spending
hours
revising
and
making
the
paper
stronger,
I
learned
how
to
quickly
digest
material
and
spit
words
out
on
a
paper.
Then
I
quickly
moved
on
to
the
next
assignment
for
my
next
class.
Rather
than
worrying
if
each
paper
represented
my
best
work,
I
worried
that
I
still
had
two
more
papers
to
do
by
the
end
of
next
week
and
the
effect
of
my
coffee
was
beginning
to
wear
off.
A
lengthy
brainstorming
process
was
no
longer
an
integral
part
of
my
writing
process.
Instead
I
sought
to
write
a
ten
page
research
paper
in
five
hours,
edit
it
in
one
and
a
half
hours,
and
start
my
next
paper
after
dinner.
I
no
longer
read
between
the
lines,
but
I
maintained
the
ability
to
write
a
decent
paper
in
a
very
short
period
of
time.
However,
due
to
the
fact
that
I
continued
to
make
very
basic
mistakes
in
structure
and
grammar,
I
knew
that
the
quality
of
my
writing
did
not
increase
even
though
the
sheer
quantity
did.
It
is
my
hope
in
the
coming
year
that
I
will
improve
my
writing
technique
so
that
I
do
not
sacrifice
the
quality
of
my
writing
when
I
am
forced
to
write
under
pressure.
To
do
so
I
may
need
to
drink
a
little
more
coffee.
When
I
think
about
the
things
I
wish
I
had
known
going
into
my
first
writing
conferences,
the
most
important
thing
for
me
would
be
the
value
of
good
communication.
It
is
not
necessary
to
sit
and
chat
for
hours
with
each
student.
However,
by
letting
people
know
that
you
are
not
just
going
through
the
motions,
they
are
more
likely
to
be
honest
about
their
work
in
a
conference.
A
WA
should
never
start
a
conference
with
a
student
they
do
not
know
thinking
that
they
already
fully
understand
that
student's
writing
process.
Even
when
a
WA
thinks
that
he
knows
a
student,
extenuating
circumstances
still
occur
from
time
to
time.
Most
importantly,
a
WA
should
not
think
of
himself
as
above
the
student.
We
are
merely
trained
readers
who
often
make
similar
mistakes
in
our
own
writing
if
we
do
not
pay
close
enough
attention.
First
and
foremost,
we
are
peer
advocates.
Our
job
is
help
the
writer
present
his
work
in
the
way
that
best
represents
his
writing
skills.
We
are
there
to
voice
the
students'
concerns
to
their
professor
and
to
try
to
help
foster
a
beneficial
writing
experience
for
all
involved.
Moreover,
by
acting
as
a
trained
reader
and
through
interactions
with
students
in
conferences
the
WA
will
hopefully
be
better
able
to
address
problems
in
his
own
writing.
It
is
this
knowledge
that
I
believe
will
most
benefit
me
and
other
writing
associates
in
the
coming
year.
