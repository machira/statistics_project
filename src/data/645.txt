The
timeline:
journey
to
WA
As
the
popular
saying
goes,
NWatch
your
thoughts
they
become
words;
watch
your
words
they
become
actions;
watch
your
actions
they
become
habits;
watch
your
habits
they
become
character;
watch
your
character
they
become
you.O
Many
people
often
doubt
the
authenticity
of
this
well-known
proverb,
I
however,
immediately
saw
the
truth
of
these
words
when
I
enrolled
in
the
poetry
club
in
middle
school.
It
dawned
on
me
during
the
composition
of
my
literary
pieces,
that
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
writing
and
spent
most
of
my
time
engaging
in
different
forms
of
literary
expression.
From
daily
diary
entries
to
constantly
reading
all
types
of
novels,
my
pastime
favorites
were
and
continue
to
be
literature-oriented.
I
blamed
it
on
the
thoughts
and
actions
of
my
childhood.
As
a
child,
I
preferred
fantasizing
under
our
mango
tree
than
playing
tag
with
my
sisters.
I
never
enjoyed
conversing
with
my
family
on
account
of
my
speech
impediment.
The
pages
of
my
diary
never
laughed
or
made
fun
of
my
accent
as
people
did.
Consequently,
my
thoughts,
my
opinions
and
basically
everything
I
wanted
to
say,
I
said
on
paper.
In
middle
school,
I
was
introduced
to
the
poetry.
Initially,
I
struggled
to
grasp
the
technicalities
of
composing
poetry
however
with
the
passing
of
my
grandfather
and
my
parentsO
divorce
my
feelings
somehow
ended
up
bypassing
protocol.
Everybody
seemed
to
thoroughly
enjoy
my
dark
yet
stimulating
pieces
on
love,
relationships
and
death.
I
was
strongly
encouraged
to
enter
essay
competitions.
I
always
placed
second
and
never
first
place.
Upset
and
feeling
unappreciated
I
decided
to
abandon
my
writing.
Much
to
my
motherOs
chagrin,
I
begun
focusing
more
on
my
other
love:
the
natural
sciences.
My
mother
is
a
lawyer
and
a
writer.
She
has
written
a
number
of
manuscripts
and
expects
my
two
sisters
and
I
to
do
the
same.
After
declaring
my
love
for
science
and
my
resignation
from
writing,
my
mother
became
upset
with
me
stating
I
was
breaking
the
family
tradition.
Disregarding
what
was
considered
the
norm
in
my
family,
I
took
the
most
challenging
science
courses
and
pushed
myself
to
excel.
But
becoming
a
writer
was
a
family
tradition
and
family
traditions
were
rarely
broken.
How
they
begin
and
how
they
are
upheld
were
a
mystery
to
me.
The
pieces
of
the
puzzle
finally
came
together
when
I
began
high
school.
Traditions,
I
believe,
begin
with
a
single
bold
step;
a
step
which
is
escalated
and
upheld
and
supported
by
members
of
the
family.
My
step
was
in
the
form
of
a
single
essay.
Irrespective
of
what
everyone
else
thought,
I
was
not
destined
to
become
a
writer.
My
childhood
games,
my
academic
success,
my
habits
and
my
interests
all
leaned
towards
the
world
of
science
as
much
as
it
did
literature.
How
could
I
not
reject
the
arts
when
I
was
in
inexplicably
in
love
with
the
sciences?
Life
is
too
short
as
I
had
learnt
from
the
sudden
death
of
my
friend
Yvonne
and
so
I
was
not
about
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
becoming
something
I
did
not
yearn
to
be.
At
the
same
time,
I
was
not
fully
prepared
to
forgo
a
hobby
I
thoroughly
enjoyed.
Therefore,
in
high
school
I
entered
my
first
essay
competition
since
my
earlier
years
in
middle
school.
I
was
really
excited
about
the
essay
because
I
gave
it
my
best.
The
excitement
that
bubbled
in
me
came
to
an
abrupt
halt
when
I
received
a
letter
thanking
me
for
my
entry
and
recognizing
my
essay
as
second
best.
Like
all
the
other
times,
my
essay
did
not
win.
I
became
displease
yet
again.
I
had
complete
faith
in
my
abilities
as
a
writer
and
so
did
my
family
members,
my
teachers
and
everyone
else
around.
I
could
not
comprehend
how
or
why
the
judges
did
not
feel
the
same
way.
Blinded
by
rage,
I
submitted
my
essay
to
the
head
of
the
English
department
instead
my
English
professor,
my
writing
mentor.
Shortly,
I
received
an
email
from
Mrs.
Baafour-Awuah,
the
head
of
the
English
department,
summoning
me
to
her
office.
I
remember
that
day
like
it
was
yesterday.
I
sat
in
the
secretaryOs
office
anxious
and
ferociously
biting
my
nails
waiting
for
that
dreadful
moment.
I
was
called
in
after
a
twenty-minute
wait.
Mrs.
Baffour-Awuah
in
a
span
of
forty-five
minutes
transformed
my
writing
style
completely.
She
managed
to,
as
it
is
often
said,
Nhit
the
nail
on
the
head.O
The
trick
to
writing
was
not
so
much
the
words
but
the
punctuations
that
transformed
the
words
into
images.
I
never
gave
thought
to
punctuations
before.
I
used
commas
sparingly
and
never
dreamed
of
incorporating
semi-colons
or
colons.
My
sentences
were
run-on
and
readers
failed
to
fully
understand
the
picture
I
attempted
to
create
due
to
lack
of
punctuations.
In
the
past,
my
teachers
had
always
placed
the
commas
and
other
punctuation
symbols
where
they
were
needed
and
I
never
questioned
why.
Mrs.
Baffour-Awuah
explained
to
me
the
uses
of
each
symbol
and
the
effect
each
on
had
on
a
sentence.
Gradually
I
began
to
incorporate
her
pointers
in
my
essays.
I
am
so
grateful
for
her
feedback
because
after
her
comments
I
won
my
first
essay
competition.
Winning
an
essay
competition
was
one
of
the
many
things
I
achieved
from
using
appropriate
punctuations.
In
addition
to
my
stellar
essay,
my
academic
writing
also
experienced
a
great
improvement.
It
was
during
my
high
school
years
that
I
realized
the
importance
of
being
a
good
writer
as
well
as
an
excellent
scientist.
A
competent
scientist
is
one
who
is
able
to
perform
experiments,
adequately
document
his/her
methods
and
procedures
and
explain
his/her
findings
in
a
well-written
publication.
Without
the
gift
of
proper
writing
a
scientist
is
not
able
to
share
his/her
knowledge
with
the
public
and
therefore
fails
to
impact
the
scientific
field.
Every
scientist
desires
to
contribute
to
the
world
of
science.
Being
equipped
with
proper
writing
tools
eases
the
process
as
I
learnt
in
high
so
much
to
my
mothers
delight
I
began
writing
again.
Together
with
my
sister,
I
wrote
and
directed
a
Christmas
play.
Our
play
was
performed
at
our
high
school
and
received
a
ten-minute
standing
ovation.
My
mother
never
looked
so
proud
standing
in
the
crowd.
She
had
plums
tears
rolling
down
her
supple
brown
cheeks
and
she
mouthed
to
my
sister
and
I
how
proud
she
was
of
us.
Naturally
one
would
think
she
would
have
mouthed
the
same
thing
as
I
stood
on
stage
and
received
the
biology
prize
for
scoring
the
best
among
my
peers.
Unfortunately,
this
was
not
the
case.
As
my
work
load
picked
up
I
gradually
drew
away
from
my
writing
hobbies.
No
longer
did
I
write
in
my
diary
nor
create
fictional
pieces
on
love.
Neither
did
I
have
the
time
to
participate
in
recreational
reading.
By
my
senior
year
of
high
school,
I
had
chosen
my
career
path:
to
become
a
medical
doctor.
In
my
determination
to
succeed
I
abandoned
the
poetry
club
and
the
literary
book
club.
As
I
started
writing
my
college
application
essay,
I
realized
what
a
disservice
I
had
done
to
myself.
Another
matter
I
came
to
acknowledge
was
the
importance
of
continuously
writing
and
reading
broadly.
I
encountered
many
challenges
expressing
myself
in
my
common
application
essay.
It
baffled
everyone
who
knew
me
that
it
took
almost
eight
weeks
to
write
my
essay.
I
knew
it
was
because
I
had
been
solely
focused
on
writing
scientific
reports.
Even
though
I
was
taking
a
course
in
English
Literature,
I
focused
more
on
biology,
chemistry
and
physics
and
did
badly
in
literature.
Once
again
I
knew
the
solution
to
the
problem
and
implemented
it.
I
picked
up
reading
historical
romance
novels,
criminal
novels,
magazines,
science
fiction
and
many
other
genres.
I
needed
to
expose
myself
to
how
people
write
and
try
to
come
to
terms
with
my
specific
writing
style.
I
managed
to
formulate
my
own
writing
style
and
stuck
to
it
by
occasionally
creating
a
fictional
10
to
20-page
book
on
a
spectrum
of
topics.
By
the
end
of
high
school
I
was
certain
that
I
was
a
very
competent
writer
and
enrolled
at
Lafayette
College
without
any
worries
about
my
performance
in
writing.
Little
did
I
know
that
the
whimsical
expectations
of
high
school
writing
varied
greatly
from
the
demands
of
college
writing.
I
surreptitiously
entered
the
classroom
where
I
was
to
endure
my
English
110
course.
I
was
amazed
at
the
array
of
faces
that
scrutinized
me;
Black,
Asian,
Caucasian,
males
and
females.
My
first
day
of
college
writing
was
going
to
be
a
bore
I
thought
to
myself.
I
assertively
picked
the
nearest
seat
to
the
entrance
and
stiffly
sat
down,
not
turning
left
or
right.
I
was
confident
in
my
writing
and
was
not
anxious
at
all.
The
scene
in
the
classroom
however
was
unlike
the
others
I
was
accustomed
to.
Born
and
raised
by
a
single
mother
in
a
small
community,
I
had
not
been
exposed
to
a
great
deal,
especially
diversity.
My
days
were
filled
with
little
homogenous
Ghanaian
children
and
my
nights
with
my
little
single-sexed
family
of
four.
Thus,
I
was
rather
shocked
at
the
array
of
opinions
being
expressed
by
the
students.
I
always
had
a
problem
with
vocalizing
my
thought
and
being
exposed
to
people
who
were
not
made
me
feel
dumb.
In
English
110,
I
learnt
how
to
take
great
care
in
mentally
writing
out
my
thought
and
views
before
I
spoke
them
out.
Although
some
will
not
consider
it
a
writing
skill,
I
believe
oral
expression
is
as
much
a
writing
skill
as
writing
down
thoughts
on
a
piece
of
paper.
Though
I
struggled
at
first,
I
somehow
managed
to
improving
my
public
speaking
by
first
constructing
the
sentences
in
my
head
first
before
voicing
them.
After
completing
English
110,
my
professor,
Ms.
Havreneck
nominated
me
for
the
Writing
Associate
(WA)
position.
I
was
elated
and
honored
by
her
nomination
and
rushed
to
apply
for
the
position.
Sadly,
I
was
not
given
the
position.
This
time
around
this
bump
in
the
road
did
not
deter
me
from
writing.
Neither
did
it
discourage
me.
It
rather
inspired
me
to
read
more
about
how
I
could
grammatically
improve
my
writing.
I
also
sort
out
my
peers
who
did
get
the
position
and
asked
them
what
it
entailed
to
be
an
outstanding
WA.
I
was
told
that
a
WA
did
not
only
note
grammatical
errors
but
aided
students
in
critical
reading
and
analytical
skills.
A
WAOs
responsibilities
include
effective
communication
and
unambiguous
feedback.
I
took
sometime
in
improving
and
acquiring
the
skills
a
WA
is
required
to
have
and
then
applied
again
for
the
position.
This
time
around
I
was
given
the
position.
My
journey
to
become
a
great
writer
included
many
trials,
many
of
which
most
writers
encounter
in
their
journeys
as
well.
Being
able
to
share
my
knowledge
and
providing
a
quicker
route
in
improving
writing
aptitude
is
something
I
am
looking
forward
to
accomplishing
as
a
WA.
In
middle
school
my
writing
aptitude
was
like
a
box
of
only
brown
crayons.
It
was
fairly
established
but
lack
diversity
and
variety.
In
high
school
my
writing
was
comparable
to
box
of
36
different
colored
crayons.
It
had
a
little
more
creativity
and
versatility.
At
Lafayette
my
literary
proficiency
is
like
box
of
240
different
colored
crayons.
I
am
now
able
to
write
address
various
assignments
from
various
academic
genres
with
ease
and
excel
at
them.
Thinking
back
on
the
successful
way
the
my
third
year
at
Lafayette
ended,
I
can
assert
with
strong
conviction
that
I
have
matured
as
a
writer;
a
lifestyle
that
has
made
me
open
minded,
more
confident,
more
accepting
and
eager
to
learn
about
other
ways
of
self-expression.
Empowered
by
my
enhanced
writing,
I
have
developed
significantly
in
the
academic
realm,
especially
in
scientific
writing,
much
to
my
motherOs
surprise
who
still
insists
that
I
would
only
succeed
as
a
writer.
I
have
become
a
successful
scientist
and
writer.
Even
though
I
did
not
follow
the
family
tradition,
I
believe
I
have
started
one.
My
dedication
to
a
science
and
literature
has
inspired
many
of
my
cousins
to
pursue
writing
as
diligently
as
their
other
talents
to
maximize
their
competency
and
to
keep
the
family
tradition.
In
conclusion,
I
would
say
I
have
had
quite
a
number
of
obstacles
on
my
journey
to
self-discovery,
self-development
and
self-success
as
a
writer.
I
have
experienced
many
challenges,
which
I
have
overcome.
I
hope
that
by
being
a
WA
I
am
able
to
improve
my
writing
and
the
writing
of
the
students
I
will
be
assigned.
