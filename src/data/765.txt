How
I
Became
a
Veteran
WA
Around
a
year
ago,
I
was
sitting
at
my
desk
looking
through
the
window
thinking
if
becoming
a
WA
was
a
good
decision.
I
had
the
contract
printed
on
my
hands
and
it
only
needed
a
signature
before
becoming
an
official
commitment.
I
remember
I
did
not
know
what
to
expect
from
the
job.
I
had
many
ideas
and
preconceptions
jumping
on
my
head.
I
did
not
know
the
dynamics
of
the
work
of
the
professors
I
was
assigned.
Working
with
first
year
students
made
me
nervous
because
I
thought
they
might
not
take
me
or
the
conferences
seriously.
The
time
the
job
required
also
worried
me
since
I
was
taking
five
courses.
All
those
thoughts
were
confusing
me
and
making
me
hesitated.
However,
after
remembering
how
much
I
learned
from
my
WA
as
first
year
student,
I
took
a
deep
breath
and
finally
signed
the
contract.
Today,
sitting
at
the
same
desk
I
did
a
year
ago,
I
look
back
at
the
experiences
I
had
working
for
the
College
Writing
Program
and
at
how
much
I
learned
from
them,
in
order
to
decide
whether
or
not
I
am
going
to
sign
the
contract
for
next
year.
As
a
student
for
whom
English
is
a
second
language,
I
always
felt
my
writing
was
not
strong
enough.
I
always
thought
that
the
mistakes
in
grammar
and
phrasing
would
make
the
understanding
of
my
papers
difficult
or
even
impossible.
During
the
conferences
with
my
WA
in
my
first
year
in
college,
I
learned
that
my
ideas
and
voice
were
the
real
focus
of
our
conversations
and
work.
The
grammar
mistakes
my
papers
had
were
small
and
we
would
not
go
over
them
unless
they
jeopardized
the
meaning
or
explanation
of
an
idea.
Working
with
my
WA
changed
how
I
felt
about
writing
while
I
learned
to
become
a
more
skillful
and
critical
writer.
When
I
started
working
as
a
WA
for
an
Advance
Spanish
course
during
fall
semester,
I
could
not
believe
my
job
was
so
closely
related
to
what
I
experienced
as
a
first
year
student.
Spanish
was
the
second
language
for
all
the
students
I
was
working
with.
During
our
first
conferences
I
was
very
surprised
when
I
could
see
myself,
as
a
first
year,
reflected
on
their
eyes.
From
the
very
beginning
I
could
see
how
the
students,
NmyO
students
as
I
used
to
call
them,
were
nervous
and
uncomfortable
speaking
and
writing
in
their
second
language.
I
immediately
felt
attached
to
them.
I
wanted
them
to
have
a
similar
experience
to
the
one
I
had;
in
other
words,
I
wanted
to
help
them
improve
their
writing
and
confidence
in
their
second
language.
The
connection
I
felt
made
me
feel
more
dedicated
to
my
job
and
more
closely
related
to
NmyO
students.
At
the
beginning
of
fall
semester,
my
journey
as
a
WA
started.
My
professor
had
a
very
organized
calendar
for
the
whole
semester,
which
helped
me
organized
my
own
schedule.
During
the
first
round
of
conferences,
I
mainly
had
to
introduce
myself
to
the
students
who
had
previously
filled
a
form
with
a
couple
of
basic
questions
that
helped
me
get
to
know
them
better
in
addition
to
giving
me
a
clear
picture
of
their
background
knowledge
in
Spanish
.
This
meeting
was
very
important
since
I
wanted
the
students
to
see
me
as
a
friend
who
they
could
talk
to
and
someone
who
could
help
them
improve
their
writing.
After
reflecting
on
that
meeting,
I
understood
the
importance
of
creating
an
environment
in
which
the
students
feel
comfortable,
heard
and
respected.
I
was
also
glad
they
recognized
the
significance
of
the
conferences.
I
must
admit
I
also
made
sure
they
knew
it
would
be
very
hard
for
me
to
reschedule
a
missing
meeting
since
my
schedule
was
demanding
that
semester.
The
conferences
and
the
staff
meetings
I
had
throughout
the
semester
taught
me
a
lot.
One
of
the
most
important
things
I
learned
is
that
a
WA
cannot
predict
how
exactly
a
conference
is
going
to
work.
A
WA
has
to
be
ready
to
adapt
to
the
specific
dynamics
of
each
conference
and
student.
I
also
learned
that
the
outcome
of
the
conferences
is
also
unpredictable.
Some
conferences
run
smoothly
and
at
the
end
you
feel
rewarded
and
proud
of
your
work.
On
the
other
hand,
some
conferences
are
challenging
and
at
the
end
they
are
not
always
reassuring.
A
perfect
example
of
a
successful
conference
as
a
WA
is
the
conference
I
had
around
the
middle
of
the
semester
with
Ana*.
At
this
point,
she
felt
more
comfortable
speaking
in
Spanish
so
almost
the
entire
conference
was
spoken
in
that
language.
I
remember
I
had
previously
read
the
paper
she
sent
me
and
made
some
notes
to
make
sure
I
remember
what
I
wanted
to
talk
about
during
the
meeting.
Her
paper
had
already
good
ideas,
but
there
was
some
room
for
improvement.
I
could
see
she
had
had
put
a
lot
of
work
into
her
paper
and
she
was
ready
for
the
meeting.
I
always
thought
that
a
successful
meeting
works
like
a
friendly
conversation
in
which
both
sides
talk
and
answer
questions.
From
the
very
beginning
this
conference
worked
that
way.
She
was
not
only
eager
to
talk
about
her
paper,
but
she
also
took
control
over
it
when
she
decided
to
take
her
own
notes
on
a
copy
of
her
paper.
I
felt
really
happy
because
in
a
way
I
knew
that
I
was
being
helpful
and
I
invited
her
to
see
her
own
writing
from
a
different
view,
a
more
critical
one.
With
the
questions
I
asked
her,
and
the
comments
I
made,
she
explained
her
initial
thoughts
more
deeply.
When
she
analyzed
those
thoughts
she
realized
her
explanations
could
go
further.
We
also
worked
on
the
order
of
her
paper
which
only
needed
small
revisions.
At
the
end
of
the
conference,
I
asked
her
if
she
had
any
questions,
after
saying
she
did
not,
she
looked
happy
and
pleased.
I
could
tell
she
felt
she
had
the
ownership
of
her
work
and
she
knew
what
changes
she
was
going
to
make
on
her
paper.
What
really
made
feel
this
was
a
successful
conference
is
the
feeling
that
Ana
felt
that
the
time
she
spent
on
the
conference
was
useful,
and
she
left
feeling
she
could
analyze
her
paper
to
see
how
she
could
improve
it
herself.
If
only
all
the
conferences
would
run
that
way,
being
a
WA
would
be
a
very
easy
and
rewarding
job.
In
reality,
that
it
is
not
the
case.
For
example,
one
of
the
most
frustrating
experiences
I
had
as
a
WA
is
a
clear
example
of
an
unsuccessful
conference.
I
had
planned
meetings
at
the
end
of
the
semester
to
talk
about
the
final
papers
for
the
class.
This
student,
John,
was
planning
to
write
a
five-page
paper
that
had
to
surpass
his
previous
writings
to
improve
his
final
grade.
He
had
an
interesting
topic,
even
though
it
was
a
bit
broad.
I
read
his
paper,
which
he
brought
to
the
meeting,
and
I
had
a
hard
time
understanding
what
the
main
focus
was,
and
what
evidence
he
wanted
to
show.
When
I
talked
to
him,
I
realized
he
did
not
know
either.
I
also
realized
he
had
not
read
the
book
the
paper
was
based
on.
He
was
confused,
and
a
bit
overwhelmed
with
the
work.
He
just
wanted
to
finish
the
paper
as
fast
as
possible.
Since
he
did
not
have
enough
information
from
the
book,
he
decided
to
compare
a
scene
with
some
sports
events.
He
had
included
at
least
more
than
three
paragraphs
with
information
about
important
competitions
and
players
that
was
not
very
related
to
the
topic.
I
decided
to
use
the
facilitative
approach
with
him,
so
I
started
asking
him
a
couple
of
questions.
I
wanted
to
see
what
his
ideas
about
the
topic
were
to
help
him
write
them
down
and
build
and
outline
from
there.
He
did
not
seem
very
interested
or
motivated
to
work.
I
could
tell
he
was
a
bit
hangover
and
he
was
not
eager
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
I
was
asking
him.
He
was
sitting
on
his
chair
looking
around
avoiding
looking
at
his
paper
or
me.
I
tried
to
get
his
attention
but
it
was
hard.
I
had
to
write
down
almost
every
word
he
was
saying
to
make
sure
he
had
his
ideas
on
paper
to
be
able
to
analyze
them
later.
I
finally
asked
him
to
write
an
outline
with
the
thoughts
he
told
me.
I
gave
him
a
couple
of
minutes
but
he
then
he
told
me
he
was
too
tired
to
finish
it.
Moreover,
the
student
that
had
the
next
conference
with
me
had
arrived.
Since
we
had
better
conferences
earlier
on
the
semester,
I
asked
him
if
he
would
like
to
meet
again
right
before
finals
week.
He
agreed
and
he
said
he
would
email
me
once
he
had
his
paper
almost
done.
I
waited
for
the
email,
but
he
never
contacted
me.
I
supposed
he
had
a
lot
work
and
he
might
have
finished
the
paper
right
before
the
due
date.
The
experience
I
had
with
John
throughout
our
last
conference
was
very
frustrating,
but
he
reminded
me
that
the
facilitative
approach
does
not
always
work.
Sometimes
some
students
need
a
direct
response
to
understand
exactly
what
a
WA
is
trying
to
suggest.
Even
though,
the
facilitative
approach
worked
for
most
of
my
conferences,
there
were
times
when
I
needed
to
specifically
give
a
suggestion
to
get
my
point
across.
When
those
occasions
happened,
I
never
felt
comfortable
telling
the
student
what
to
do.
By
giving
a
direct
instruction
I
felt
the
paper
was
also
mine
so
I
felt
responsible
for
the
outcome.
On
the
other
hand,
when
I
only
used
the
facilitative
approach,
I
realized
that
the
next
conferences
with
the
students
were
a
bit
easier
since
they
knew
the
decisions
to
be
taken
about
the
paper
were
entirely
up
to
them.
The
ownership
they
felt
also
made
them
come
to
the
conferences
more
prepared
because
they
realized
they
get
more
out
of
the
conferences
if
they
put
more
work
into
them.
They
also
learned
to
objectively
criticize
their
own
work
and
challenge
their
ideas
and
the
way
in
which
they
phrase
them.
Sometimes
the
students
felt
they
were
on
the
spotlight,
but
I
tried
to
avoid
awkward
silences
and
kept
the
conversation
going
in
a
friendly
manner.
After
a
while,
my
students
adjusted
to
the
dynamics
of
the
conference
and
started
feeling
comfortable
doing
the
talking.
Something
I
learned
from
the
staff
meetings
that
I
found
very
useful
during
the
conferences
is
that
the
WA
has
to
imitate
the
body
language
of
the
students
that
seem
distracted
or
bored.
When
my
students
saw
their
body
language
mirrored
by
me,
they
felt
uneasy
and
unconsciously
tried
to
get
closer
to
their
paper
and
work
harder.
Having
the
studentOs
paper
in
the
middle
of
the
table
or
sometimes
a
bit
closer
to
the
student
also
helped
them
pay
attention
and
follow
what
part
of
the
paper
I
was
pointing
out.
Even
though,
being
a
WA
took
an
important
portion
of
my
time,
I
can
say
I
felt
truly
rewarded
by
my
job.
I
never
taught
I
would
be
passionate
about
helping
other
students
improve
their
writing.
The
impact
the
job
has
had
on
me
and
on
my
writing
was
something
I
was
not
expecting.
I
met
amazing
people
from
whom
I
learned
a
lot.
The
weekly
staff
meetings
were
refreshing
because
they
were
fun
and
it
was
niece
to
share
my
experiences
with
people
who
were
living
similar
ones.
Those
meetings
also
helped
me
become
a
better
WA
since
I
learned
from
the
experiences
of
my
coworkers.
I
cannot
even
count
the
times
in
which
I
encountered
a
situation
similar
to
the
one
someone
had
already
described
in
a
meeting.
Having
that
group
of
friends
helped
me
keep
track
of
my
work
while
I
felt
strongly
supported
by
my
team.
The
impact
of
what
I
learned
during
that
semester
on
my
writing
is
fascinating;
at
least
that
is
how
I
see
it.
Every
time
I
read
a
piece
of
my
own
writing,
I
start
building
an
outline
on
my
head
to
make
sure
all
I
write
is
relevant
to
the
topic.
I
also
tend
to
condense
information
that
is
not
very
relevant
to
my
discussion
faster.
I
feel
a
bit
less
attached
to
what
I
write,
what
makes
editing
easier.
I
read
my
pieces
with
a
different
perspective,
a
perspective
that
allows
me
to
question
what
I
write
and
how
I
explain
it.
Proofreading
and
having
a
peer
proofreading
my
writing
has
also
become
important
to
my
improvement.
I
am
glad
I
decided
to
sign
that
contract
a
year
ago.
Taking
that
risk
was
gratifying.
After
reflecting
on
the
positive
and
negative
experiences
I
had
as
a
WA,
I
feel
I
cannot
wait
to
sign
the
new
contract
this
year.
