From
Handwriting
to
Academic
Writing
In
first
grade
I
remember
being
jealous
of
Andrew
Chang.
While
I
was
forced
to
do
every
handwriting
exercise
numerous
times,
he
got
to
sit
in
the
back
of
the
room
and
draw.
This
was
before
cursive
even
existed
in
our
worlds.
The
almost
unobtainable
goal
of
all
of
us
boys
(besides
Andrew)
was
to
keep
our
letters
straight
and
clear
and
our
spacing
consistent
and
reasonable.
The
only
concern
was
how
well
we
could
duplicate
the
given
sentences
onto
our
own
papers.
The
girls
were
great
and
the
boys
were
sloppy.
By
fourth
grade
we
had
mastered
dotting
our
i's
and
crossing
our
t's.
We
also
realized,
thanks
to
cursive,
that
the
letters
did
not
have
to
be
all
that
straight
and
the
spacing
between
them
was
worthless.
I
could
finally
reproduce
simple
facts
and
the
ideas
of
others
onto
paper
well
enough
that
mostly
every
one
of
my
teachers
with
above
average
eyesight
could
read
my
work.
I
thought
the
game
was
over
and
I
had
won!
That
was
when
explorer
Leif
Erikson
was
introduced
to
our
fourth
grade
Social
Studies
class.
My
first
research
paper
was
to
be
five
pages
long
and
we
had
only
about
four
months
to
complete
the
process.
I
could
not
understand
why
I
had
to
write
his
biography
when
there
were
already
so
many
books
about
him,
not
to
mention
the
research
papers
of
the
previous
year's
class.
I
remember
when
our
teacher,
Mr.
Ziegler,
gave
us
that
thick,
blue
folder
filled
with
note
cards,
bibliography
slips
and
the
locally
renowned
Centennial
School
District
Research
Paper
Writing
Packet.
I
felt
both
nervous
and
proud.
Our
focus
was
on
making
a
coherent
outline
comprised
of
all
the
separate
parts
of
Leif
Erikson's
life
and
then
sticking
to
that
game
plan.
We
made
the
outline,
gathered
information,
wrote
facts
on
note
cards,
re-wrote
the
facts
on
new
note
cards
so
the
teacher
could
read
them,
did
a
few
more
random
tasks
and,
by
the
end,
we
had
all
produced
extremely
orderly,
yet
simplified,
accounts
of
Leif
Erickson's
life.
The
content
of
my
paper
was
deemed
very
good
by
Mr.
Ziegler
and
I
received
a
100%
for
that
portion.
However,
my
overall
grade
for
the
paper
was
a
B;
I
still
could
not
spell
very
well
and
my
handwriting
left
a
lot
to
be
desired.
Almost
all
the
writing
we
did
throughout
elementary
school
and
middle
school
came
in
the
context
of
our
English
classes.
The
next
stage
I
clearly
remember
was
that
of
becoming
a
good
speller.
This
meant
that
by
concentrating
on
learning
to
spell
for
a
long
time,
we
were
also
putting
our
development
as
writers
off
to
the
side.
Therefore,
I
cannot
recall
much
about
my
writing
from
my
last
year
in
Davis
Elementary
School
or
from
my
first
year
in
Klinger
Middle
School.
I
do
remember,
however,
misspelling
the
word
stir
and
the
subsequent
disappointment
and
shame
I
felt
from
being
an
unexpected
early
round
loser
in
the
fifth
grade
spelling
bee.
By
the
time
I
reached
the
seventh
grade,
I
had
figured
out
how
to
spell
almost
all
the
important
words
(besides
necessary
and
successful)
and
was
ready
to
write
thought-provoking
book
reports.
I
was
now
entering
the
seventh
grade
and
still
had
not
really
received
any
type
of
feedback
on
my
writing
abilities.
Any
types
of
writing
exercises
I
may
have
done
were
judged
by
criteria
such
as
length,
spelling,
handwriting
and
ideas.
Words
like
clarity,
conciseness,
and
fluidity
had
still
not
entered
my
vocabulary.
Over
the
following
two
academic
years
(seventh
and
eighth
grade)
I
wrote
close
to
three
million
book
reports.
These
book
reports
were
merely
book
summaries,
as
we
were
only
responsible
for
providing
the
who,
what,
where,
when,
and
why
of
the
given
novel.
My
first
glimpse
of
literary
analysis
came
through
the
two-sentence
book
recommendation
I
had
to
include
in
the
conclusion
of
one
of
these
reports.
If
we
wanted
to
show
our
creativity
as
writers,
we
could
include
a
cover-page
(for
extra-credit,
of
course)
with
a
drawing
that
we
deemed
representative
of
the
book.
Although
I
do
not
remember
learning
very
much
about
being
a
good
writer
between
seventh
and
ninth
grade,
the
mere
practice
I
received
from
writing
what
seemed
like
a
countless
number
of
book
reports
surely
increased
my
comfort
level
for
written
expression.
In
ninth
grade
I
grew
up
as
a
writer.
Mr.
Lacy
was
a
no
nonsense
type
of
teacher
who
never
hesitated
to
show
his
cynicism.
We
wrote
one
paper
each
month
in
his
class,
but
even
when
we
were
not
writing,
we
were
becoming
better
writers.
Mostly
all
of
his
classes
turned
into
some
type
of
debate.
He
was
not
concerned
with
the
subject
of
the
discussions,
just
that
we
learned
to
make
strong
arguments,
which
were
both
convincing
and
credible.
This
was
very
important
for
me
because
when
I
would
normally
argue
something,
either
written
or
verbally,
I
would
be
so
sure
that
I
was
right
that
I
would
only
show
my
point
of
view,
thus
taking
away
from
my
credibility
and
the
overall
effectiveness
of
my
point.
I
realized
that
Mr.
Lacy
clearly
had
a
different
approach
to
writing
(and
education
in
general)
when
he
spent
nearly
an
entire
class
explaining
what
he
expected
from
our
written
work
without
even
mentioning
format,
length
expectations,
nor
our
grades.
My
poor
handwriting
would
hold
me
back
no
longer-
our
papers
were
all
to
be
typed.
Mr.
Lacy
was
also
my
English
teacher
for
the
following
year
(no
I
did
not
fail
the
ninth
grade)
as
he
was
switched
to
the
tenth
grade
English
classes
after
my
freshman
year
in
high
school.
In
his
class
I
learned
about
the
conflict
found
within
each
novel.
He
prefaced
his
explanation
by
showing
that
there
were
many
types
of
conflicts:
man
versus
man,
man
versus
nature,
man
versus
machines,
etc.
Then
he
threw
in
the
three
words
that
indirectly
catapulted
me
into
being
a
more
informed
reader
and
writer:
on
the
surface.
Mr.
Lacy
continued,
"No
matter
what
the
conflict
is
on
the
surface,
the
true
conflict
in
the
novel
is
man
versus
man."
Those
three
words
opened
me
to
a
whole
new
dimension
in
reading
and
writing.
The
first
dimension
of
on
the
surface
I
had
pretty
much
mastered.
It
took
me
close
to
ten
years,
but
I
had
done
it!
I
could
explain
all
of
the
facts
of
a
novel
and
memorize
their
sequence
as
explained
by
the
author.
The
new
dimension
was
called
beneath
the
surface.
This
one,
I
quickly
learned,
would
never
be
mastered.
This
dimension
did
not
just
apply
to
the
main
conflict
of
a
novel,
but
to
every
single
aspect
of
it.
There
was
a
beneath
the
surface
in
each
chapter,
page,
and
word.
By
the
end
of
tenth
grade,
I
had
become
a
competent
and
confident
writer.
I
learned
to
view
literature
as
more
than
just
a
simple
account
of
occurrences.
I
could
express
my
views
and
analysis
of
a
given
work
in
a
more
mature
way.
I
was
straightforward
and
well
organized,
yet
still
displayed
a
good
understanding
of
complex
issues
and
could
subtlety
inject
fifty-cent
vocabulary
words
into
most
sentences
(I
made
a
point
of
using
the
word
loquacious
two
to
three
times
each
paper).
My
progression
as
a
writer,
however,
was
to
take
a
year
sabbatical.
In
eleventh
grade
I
had
an
AP
English
class
which
focused
on
reading
and
analyzing
many
classical
short
stories.
I
enjoyed
the
class
very
much,
but
most
of
the
analysis
was
done
verbally.
I
cannot
concretely
recall
writing
one
out-of
-class
paper
during
that
year.
I
do
remember
writing
various
in-class
essays,
but
I
always
felt
so
rushed
and
distracted
that
I
knew
I
was
not
putting
forth
anything
that
even
closely
resembled
my
best
work.
In
my
other
classes
that
year,
I
did
write
some
other
random
academic
essays,
but
all
the
feedback
I
received
was
regarding
the
content
and
not
the
actual
writing.
Going
into
my
senior
year,
I
figured
I
would
be
a
great
writer
based
on
the
following
logic:
I
was
a
reasonably
good
writer
in
tenth
grade
and
now
I
was
two
years
older
and
smarter.
The
problem
with
this
logic
was
that
I
overlooked
my
not
writing
or
receiving
feedback
on
my
writing
for
over
a
year.
Not
only
had
my
progression
stopped,
I
had
become
an
example
of
the
time
old
adage
if
you
don't
use
it,
you
lose
it.
Even
though
I
should
have
been
trying
to
write
similarly
to
the
way
I
was
at
the
end
of
tenth
grade
and
allowing
my
natural
progression
to
continue,
I
had
already
decided
that
I
was
now
a
great
writer
(see
the
aforementioned
logic).
As
a
great
writer,
I
felt
compelled
to
constantly
put
on
display
my
extensive
vocabulary
(<desultory
had
replaced
loquacious)
and
I
could
now
offer
extremely
esoteric
and
vague
concepts
without
feeling
obligated
to
neither
explain
nor
justify
them.
I
had
thought
getting
my
driver's
license
was
fun,
but
I
was
not
even
prepared
for
the
euphoria
that
accompanied
my
self-proclaimed
poetic
one!
The
feedback
from
my
twelfth
grade
English
teacher
was
very
appropriate.
She
said
that
my
writing
was
fairly
good,
but
it
was
too
stilted
and
dramatic.
I
am
normally
very
receptive
to
criticism,
providing
that
I
respect
the
source
from
which
it
comes.
I
did
not
respect
this
teacher
very
much
and
usually
referred
to
her
class
as
a
#$@%A&#
joke!
We
routinely
spent
the
majority
of
each
period
either
doing
busy
work
or
listening
to
her
berate
the
unruly
students
(usually
me).
Nonetheless,
she
was
very
accurate
with
her
evaluation
of
my
work.
As
the
year
progressed
and
I
started
to
do
a
lot
of
writing
for
the
college
application
process,
I
slowly
began
toning-down
my
style
and
focusing
more
on
the
quality
and
consistency
of
my
work.
The
words
clarity,
conciseness
and
fluidity
reentered
my
vocabulary
(they
apparently
escaped
sometime
after
I
finished
the
tenth
grade)
and
they
were
making
their
way
into
my
writing
again.
This
refinement
of
my
writing
could
have
been
attributed
to
many
circumstances,
but
more
than
anything,
I
feared
the
new
academic
endeavor
college
presented
and
knew
I
would
not
be
able
to
impress
my
professors
with
big
words
and
obscure
references
alone.
I
kept
that
idea
harbored
in
my
mind
throughout
that
summer
and
up
until
it
was
time
to
write
my
first
FYS
(First-Year-Seminar)
paper.
I
was
always
very
much
turned
off
by
the
educational
realities
of
my
high
school,
for
it
seemed
that
grades
and
most
of
the
other
evaluation
mechanisms
had
very
little
to
do
with
the
content
of
the
student's
work
and
even
less
to
do
with
his/her
overall
academic
prowess.
My
grades
were
good
throughout
high
school,
but
not
great.
Although
I
was
able
to
identify
the
shortcomings
of
my
high
school
and
understand
that
my
grades
there
did
not
define
my
worth
as
a
student,
I
was
not
able
to
truly
internalize
this.
Going
into
my
freshman
year
at
Lafayette,
I
did
not
have
a
tremendous
amount
of
confidence
in
my
academic
abilities.
One
paper
later,
I
was
a
different
student.
My
first
paper
as
a
Lafayette
student
was
for
my
FYS
class
and
had
to
be
only
a
few
pages
long.
I
wrote
about
the
many
archetypes
concerning
men
that
suggest
they
cannot
achieve
true
intimacy
with
each
other.
I
would
have
rather
written
about
the
prevalence
of
iron
deficiencies
in
prematurely
balding
men
or
the
role
of
the
earthworm
in
the
animal
food
chain.
Regardless
of
the
topic,
I
knew
I
was
going
to
try
my
hardest
to
write
a
coherent,
well-organized,
thought-provoking
and
overall
solid
paper.
After
a
short
writing
process,
a
few
meetings
with
our
Writing
Associate,
and
the
teacher
finally
grading
the
paper,
I
was
convinced
that
I
had
found
a
good
blueprint
for
my
future
writings
and
that
I
would
continue
my
development
as
a
writer.
Over
the
rest
of
my
FYS
course
and
that
entire
year,
my
progression
continued.
Once
again,
however,
that
progression
was
to
be
hindered
as
I
spent
my
sophomore
year
studying
in
Malaga,
Spain.
This
past
year
in
Spain
has
served,
in
many
ways,
as
a
microcosm
of
my
lifelong
developmental
process
as
a
writer.
Although
I
brought
with
me
many
of
the
necessary
tools
that
would
allow
me
to
become
a
good
writer
and
communicator
in
Spanish,
it
has
still
been
a
long
process.
Remembering
accent
mark
placement
has
replaced
my
adolescent
troubles
of
learning
to
spell.
My
still
existent
American
accent
is
like
my
bad
childhood
handwriting.
In
Spain,
I
sometimes
had
to
struggle
to
remember
simple
vocabulary
words,
while
here
I
had
to
fight
myself
not
to
abuse
the
complex
ones.
My
progression
in
Spanish
was
a
lot
faster
than
in
learning
to
be
a
good
writer,
but
also
more
painful
(especially
that
first
day
when
I
had
to
explain
why
I
had
overflowed
the
toilet
in
my
house).
I
have
written
two
papers
in
English
over
the
past
year
(both
for
the
WA
Program)
and
each
one
has
been
rather
challenging.
It
takes
a
little
more
time
now
for
that
perfect
word
to
jump
into
my
mind;
I
have
to
scream
a
few
more
four-letter
words
while
trying
to
uncover
that
precise
analogy.
All
of
these
setbacks,
however,
are
minor.
They
cannot
undo
a
lifetime
of
development
as
a
writer-
unless
I
let
them.
I
am
pleased
with
my
progress
as
a
writer
and
I
am
certain
that
I
will
continue
to
improve.
But,
most
importantly,
I
am
not
so
jealous
of
Andrew
Chang's
perfectly
shaped
letters
anymore!
