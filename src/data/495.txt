My
History
as
a
Writer
One
evening,
after
I
returned
home
from
college
for
the
summer,
I
was
helping
my
ten
year
old
brother
with
a
fifth
grade
language
arts
assignment.
The
teacher
wanted
him
to
construct
a
creative
journal
with
short
stories,
drawings,
and
essays.
Although
I
was
helping
him
with
his
grammar
and
giving
him
ideas,
he
was
doing
all
of
the
writing.
I
sat
by
and
watched
him
as
he
wrote.
Every
letter
had
to
be
perfectly
aligned
with
the
paper
and
had
to
look
like
a
professional
wrote
it.
If
the
words
were
not
written
flawlessly,
he
erased
them
until
there
were
small
holes
throughout
the
paper!
I
looked
at
him
and
could
not
believe
how
meticulous
he
had
to
be
with
his
writing.
When
I
told
him
it
didnOt
have
to
be
perfect,
my
mom
and
dad,
sitting
nearby,
simply
laughed
out
loud.
That
is
when
they
told
me
that
since
I
was
five
years
old;
learning
to
write
the
alphabet,
I
was
always
concerned
with
what
I
wrote
and
how
I
wrote
it-
making
sure
it
was
written
to
perfection.
As
I
watched
my
brother
I
hoped
that
he
would
continue
to
work
as
hard
as
I
had
on
my
writing
skills.
I
could
only
smile
in
delight
as
I
realized
how
glad
I
was
that
at
only
five
years
old
I
was
diligently
erasing
and
rewriting
my
assignments;
beginning
my
journey
as
a
writer.
Since
I
was
in
elementary
school,
I
have
always
enjoyed
more
creative
writing
coursework.
Math
and
science
projects
were
always
so
difficult
for
me,
but
writing
came
naturally.
One
of
my
greatest
writing
accomplishments
was
a
short
story
I
wrote
and
illustrated;
eventually
making
it
a
real
book.
I
worked
on
my
book
for
two
months
as
my
teacher
was
always
there
to
help
answer
spelling
and
grammatical
questions.
Although
the
whole
class
had
this
assignment,
I
will
never
forget
how
proud
I
was
to
write
my
own
fictional
story
and
NpublishO
it
in
my
elementary
school.
I
occasionally
find
this
book
I
wrote
and
flip
through
the
pages
that
are
discolored
from
age.
It
clearly
looks
like
a
seven
year
old
created
it,
but
at
that
time
I
enjoyed
writing
it
and
that
love
of
writing
has
always
stayed
with
me.
I
have
clear
memories
of
carefully
thinking
about,
planning,
and
writing
all
my
assignments
since
I
was
young.
Personally,
I
always
wanted
to
write
the
perfect
story,
the
perfect
essay,
or
even
the
perfect
poem.
Before
I
had
anything
written
out,
I
would
plan
for
hours.
Planning
consisted
of
finding
a
quote
that
would
spark
the
readersO
interest
or
end
my
assignment
leaving
the
reader
enthralled.
I
always
needed
to
ask
the
teacher
to
specifically
explain
what
he/she
wanted
in
my
work.
My
writing
as
a
child
was
more
to
satisfy
others.
I
tried
to
write
my
best
to
receive
an
A+
in
my
classes.
All
of
these
writing
forms
were
generally
assigned
to
me
and
most
of
the
papers
I
wrote
before
I
was
twelve
were
school
related
work.
It
would
not
be
until
I
spent
some
time
with
my
grandmother
one
summer
that
I
learned
what
I
could
really
do
with
pen
and
paper
and
how
to
sincerely
enjoy
writing.
My
ability
as
a
writer
began
to
change
when
I
entered
middle
school,
around
the
age
of
ten.
When
I
was
twelve
years
old,
my
sister
and
I
spent
two
weeks
with
my
grandparents.
I
always
loved
to
go
there
not
only
because
I
loved
every
second
I
spent
with
my
grandparents,
but
because
my
grandma
would
delve
into
deep
conversations
about
all
things
in
life
with
my
sister
and
I;
regardless
of
our
age.
We
were
never
too
young
to
discuss
anything
with
her.
The
fondest
memory
I
have
about
my
grandmother
was
her
love
for
poetry.
Since
she
was
a
child
she
wrote
poems
that
were
unforgettable
and
extremely
introspective.
When
I
visited
she
would
take
out
all
of
her
old
poetry
books
and
her
personal
poetry
notebooks
and
we
would
read
for
hours.
At
such
a
young
age
I
was
already
beginning
to
admire
the
work
of
poets
such
as;
Robert
Service,
Robert
Louis
Stevenson,
and
Carl
Sandburg.
Just
as
these
poets
had
inspired
my
grandma,
she
inspired
me.
That
summer
I
stayed
at
her
house,
she
bought
me
my
own
poetry
notebook.
She
helped
me
understand
how
poetry
could
be
personal,
emotional,
or
simply
tell
a
story.
I
immediately
fell
in
love
with
writing
poems
and
one
day
I
hoped
I
could
write
similar
to
my
grandma.
As
I
wrote
poem
after
poem,
I
would
show
her
my
work
and
I
could
tell
how
proud
of
me
she
was.
This
form
of
expression
has
always
been
so
personal
to
me.
Today
I
have
taken
my
grandmotherOs
love
of
poetry
and
I
continue
to
write
on
my
own.
While
I
may
not
show
my
journal
to
many
people
now,
I
will
always
keep
memories
and
stories
of
the
past
written
down
inside
so
I
can
remember
them
forever.
While
I
had
always
enjoyed
creative
writing
assignments
and
personal
writing,
I
originally
feared
research
papers
and
argumentative
pieces.
This
was
due
to
the
fact
that
I
felt
I
did
not
have
the
ability
to
clearly
present
an
argument
and
because
everything
I
wrote
always
had
to
be
perfect
in
my
mind.
I
thought
that
the
finished
product
of
my
work
was
not
efficient
and
strong.
However,
since
eighth
grade
my
feelings
have
changed.
As
an
eighth
grader,
all
students
were
expected
to
complete
a
research
paper
after
four
months
of
researching.
Every
week
I
was
assigned
time
in
the
library
with
a
teacher
to
read
books
concerning
my
topic
of
capital
punishment.
While
reading
I
wrote
meticulous
notes
and
eventually
created
an
outline.
This
process
helped
teach
me
the
necessity
of
research
and
background
information
before
even
writing
a
single
page
of
an
argumentative
paper.
Also,
I
learned
the
value
of
understanding
both
sides
of
an
argument
before
writing.
Sometimes
the
strongest
papers
I
wrote
were
due
to
the
fact
that
I
knew
more
about
the
opposing
side
and
could
refute
it.
While
writing
many
variations
of
my
paper
I
realized
how
important
the
drafting
process
was.
To
this
day
in
college
I
write
many
drafts
before
I
submit
my
final
copy
because
there
is
always
room
for
improvement
in
my
writing.
While
I
had
my
teachers
read
many
drafts,
sometimes
it
was
difficult
to
accept
their
constructive
criticism.
Through
high
school
and
now
college,
however,
I
have
learned
that
when
other
professors
and
students
critique
my
work
it
is
because
I
am
working
to
write
to
the
best
of
my
ability.
While
it
was
originally
hard
to
accept
others
giving
me
their
ideas,
it
has
only
been
for
my
benefit.
Overall,
my
final
research
paper
was
informative
yet
concise.
I
can
definitely
say
it
is
the
one
piece
I
am
extremely
proud
of.
I
will
always
remember
the
writing
process
involved;
long
but
worthwhile.
By
the
time
I
entered
high
school,
not
only
had
my
outlook
on
writing
changed,
but
my
abilities
also.
All
types
of
writing
were
assigned
as
I
continued
to
take
honors
level
English.
After
enduring
four
years
of
higher
level
English
courses
in
high
school,
I
can
credit
my
teachers
and
my
hard
work
staying
focused
for
all
the
writing
skills
I
have
learned.
During
freshmen
year
I
became
acquainted
with
the
mechanics
of
writing
and
different
formats
for
various
assignments.
Students
at
my
high
school
were
expected
to
write
essays,
journals,
creative
writing
pieces,
research
papers
and
analyze
novels
and
plays.
The
curriculum
was
extremely
rigid
and
intense.
Sometimes
when
I
felt
that
the
writing
was
impossible
and
thought
that
I
could
never
write
as
well
as
other
students
at
my
level,
the
help
of
my
teachers
got
me
through.
Looking
back,
I
was
sufficiently
prepared
for
college
and
ultimately
had
little
reservations
about
writing
for
my
college
professors.
My
junior
year
of
high
school
stands
out
in
my
mind
as
a
turning
point
in
my
writing
career.
The
honors
English
course
I
took
was
incredibly
intense
due
to
the
constant
reading
and
writing.
Many
assignments
included
the
assessment
of
books
and
poetry.
My
teacher
always
had
me
analyzing
everything
I
read
and
explaining
what
every
detail
meant.
Every
time
a
paper
was
due,
we
submitted
one
rough
draft
before
the
final
copy.
I
would
work
diligently
to
write
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
every
time
I
received
a
draft
back
it
looked
as
if
a
red
pen
had
exploded
on
my
paper.
My
teacher
basically
tore
apart
what
I
had
written
offering
different
ideas
and
asking
questions.
I
always
thought
I
would
never
be
able
to
write
a
well-written,
A-type
paper.
However,
the
constant
dissection
of
my
writing
was
what
ultimately
prepared
me
for
college-level
writing
and
made
me,
I
believe,
the
writer
I
am
today.
While
grammar
and
spelling
is
necessary
to
understand
when
writing,
I
realized
during
my
junior
year
how
to
place
all
my
cluttered
thoughts
into
a
clear
and
concise
discussion
and
write
it
down
on
paper.
Similar
to
many
new
students
at
college,
I
was
nervous
to
attend
my
first
college
course.
I
feared
I
would
not
be
prepared
for
what
I
expected
to
be
the
most
challenging
classes
of
my
life.
I
soon
learned
that
college,
like
high
school,
was
just
another
step
forward
in
my
education
and
I
was
extremely
prepared
for
what
the
professors
expected
of
me.
The
first
paper
I
submitted
in
college
was
during
my
First-year
Seminar.
It
was
a
dramaturgical
analysis
concerning
the
performance
of
sports
teams
in
society.
Like
my
peers,
I
was
hesitant
to
hand
over
my
final
draft,
but
when
I
received
it
back
with
a
B+,
I
realized
that
my
hard
work
was
worthwhile
and
I
actually
was
prepared
for
college
level
writing.
Of
course
not
all
of
my
writing
assignments
have
been
simple
to
write
since
then,
but
I
have
developed
my
own
method
for
writing
different
types
of
pieces
and
I
try
to
improve
it
with
every
final
paper.
My
sophomore
year
at
Lafayette
College
helped
me
to
further
validate
my
career
as
a
writer.
While
I
enjoyed
writing
assignments
over
exams
and
other
assignments
and
considered
myself
to
be
a
decent
writer,
I
never
thought
I
was
a
great
writer.
Professors
generally
commented
on
my
work,
some
giving
me
praise
and
others
always
telling
me
what
I
needed
to
work
on.
However,
I
believed
my
work
to
be
acceptable
and
what
the
professor
was
looking
for.
One
day,
during
second
semester,
changed
my
opinions
on
what
my
professors
really
thought
of
my
writing
potential.
I
received
a
letter
in
my
mailbox
suggesting
that
I
should
apply
to
be
a
writing
associate
at
Lafayette.
Apparently
one
of
my
professors
believed
my
work
and
my
peer
reviews
in
class
to
be
outstanding.
During
the
class
time
we
were
expected
to
read
the
work
of
other
students
in
the
class
and
write
an
extensive,
thoughtful
peer
review.
As
a
writer
I
realized
that
I
had
the
ability
to
read
assignments
of
others
in
detail
and
help
them
improve.
While
it
was
a
lot
of
work
to
review
other
papers,
usually
taking
up
to
forty-five
minutes
for
a
five
page
draft,
I
realized
some
important
things.
My
writing
experience
in
the
past
and
today
has
given
me
the
ability
to
evaluate
the
work
of
others
even
better
than
my
own.
Sometimes,
as
the
writer
of
my
own
work,
I
have
a
bias
attitude
towards
what
I
write
because
I
fail
to
find
as
many
faults
in
the
work
as
there
are.
However,
when
examining
writing
completed
by
my
peers
I
have
a
more
open
mind.
When
I
received
the
recommendation
from
my
professor
I
was
extremely
proud
and
honored.
From
elementary
school
all
the
way
through
high
school
and
my
first
year
of
college,
my
hard
work
had
improved
my
writing
ability.
Applying
for
the
job
as
a
writing
associate
gave
me
more
confidence
in
my
writing
and
ability
to
understand
the
process
of
writing.
As
I
glimpse
back
into
my
childhood
and
reflect
on
my
history
as
a
writer
I
realize
it
was
a
long
process
that
could
never
be
learned
over
night.
The
amount
of
effort
I
have
always
put
into
my
work,
from
writing
short
stories
in
second
grade
to
dramaturgical
analysisO
in
college,
has
benefited
my
capabilities
as
a
writer.
Originally
only
enjoying
creative
writing
pieces,
I
have
grown
to
understand
the
value
of
research
and
argumentative
pieces.
I
feel
comfortable
submitting
writing
assignments
to
my
professors,
only
after
having
written
various
drafts
and
trying
to
write
the
best
I
can.
I
have
learned
how
to
utilize
constructive
criticism
from
professors
and
peers,
rather
than
ignore
it.
Overall
I
feel
that
the
most
important
aspect
of
my
writing
is
that
I
am
proud
of
every
work
I
submit.
With
effort
and
hard
work
my
experience
as
a
writer
has
grown
with
the
expectations
placed
on
me
every
year.
While
I
have
more
to
learn
in
order
to
become
a
great
writer,
I
can
look
back
and
realize
how
much
I
have
already
improved.
