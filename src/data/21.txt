Literacy
Narrative
My
experience
as
a
writer
began
a
very
long
time
ago.
In
my
childhood
years
I
was
fascinated
by
books,
so
learning
how
to
write
was
an
amazing
discovery.
It
meant
that
I
could
also
aspire
to
write
amazing
stories
about
journeys
into
the
Far
East
and
invent
my
own
legends.
That,
of
course,
took
a
long
while.
My
very
first
memory
of
writing
was
during
my
early
teenage
years.
I
had
received
a
diary
for
Christmas,
and
I
promised
to
myself
that
I
would
keep
a
thorough
record
of
my
thoughts
and
teenage
adventures.
I
kept
that
promise
for
about
a
year
and
a
half.
The
diary
consisted
mostly
of
day-to-day
events,
along
with
the
particular
feelings
that
these
events
evoked.
Along
with
the
journal,
I
began
to
write
poetry.
It
was
quite
awkward
at
first,
for
I
began
writing
it
in
English,
my
second
language.
I
had
already
studied
English
for
several
years,
but,
for
the
first
time,
I
felt
comfortable
enough
to
describe
emotions.
Slowly,
I
became
accustomed
to
the
language,
and
my
poetry
improved.
The
range
of
feelings
that
I
wrote
about
was
very
extensive.
Love,
hate,
joy,
loneliness,
life,
death,
all
of
them
had
a
place
in
my
collection.
However,
I
always
felt
my
best
poetry
came
through
in
times
of
despair.
My
freshman
and
sophomore
years
in
high
school
were
quite
uneventful
in
terms
of
writing.
I
wrote
the
required
papers
without
any
clear
idea
of
the
purpose
or
technique
involved
in
the
assignments.
I
had
gained
enough
experience
with
English
to
write
successful
papers,
but
I
never
worked
on
them
in
a
systematic
manner.
The
rebirth
of
my
writing
came
during
my
junior
year
in
high
school.
I
owe
this
rebirth
entirely
to
Dr.
Young,
my
English
professor
at
the
time.
He
had
been
a
professor
at
Columbia
University,
at
the
graduate
level.
As
a
consequence,
he
was
extremely
demanding.
The
first
paper
I
turned
in
for
his
class
was
a
complete
failure.
There
was
no
organization
or
structure
in
the
paper,
and
the
main
thesis
had
not
been
present
in
the
assignment.
Since
the
class
consisted
of
weekly
book
reports
of
rather
difficult
reading,
I
had
to
shape
up
quickly.
By
the
end
of
my
junior
year,
I
had
developed
a
systematic
method
for
writing
English
assignments.
During
my
senior
year,
I
continued
to
improve
my
writing
abilities,
earning
the
respect
of
several
of
my
professors.
It
was
also
during
my
senior
year
that
I
resumed
my
poetry
writing.
However,
I
decided
to
experiment
with
Spanish.
It
had
been
a
long
time
since
I
had
written
any
assignments
or
done
any
creative
writing
in
my
native
tongue.
Also,
my
themes
were
different.
My
efforts
were
geared
into
descriptive
poetry,
and
the
Mexican
landscape
and
culture
became
my
background.
My
poetry
became
much
more
mature,
and
I
reveled
in
the
beauty
and
extensiveness
of
my
own
language.
Writing
in
college
became
a
much
more
interesting
enterprise.
My
background
had
been
very
instructive
and
useful,
but
I
was
not
prepared
to
encounter
the
variety
of
topics
available
in
college
assignments.
Also,
becoming
acquainted
with
a
computer
was
a
completely
new
experience.
All
throughout
high
school
I
had
worked
with
an
old
typewriter,
which
meant
that
the
paper
had
to
be
fully
organized
before
I
began
typing
it.
As
I
became
familiar
with
computers,
I
learned
to
be
much
more
flexible
with
the
ideas
that
came
into
my
mind.
Now,
if
a
great
idea
came
to
me
in
the
middle
of
a
paper,
I
was
not
forced
to
discard
it
in
order
to
avoid
repeating
the
entire
paper.
I
could
actually
type
my
idea
and
incorporate
it
to
the
paper,
therefore
creating
much
more
interesting
assignments.
As
a
freshman,
I
took
the
First
Year
Seminar,
which
enabled
me
to
write
about
a
completely
different
set
of
topics.
My
First
Year
Seminar
was
rather
unique
in
its
approach.
The
topic
was
fairly
common
in
the
United
States;
however,
to
me
it
was
a
completely
new
experience,
and
a
new
way
of
looking
at
people.
No
longer
was
I
doing
simple
reports
to
turn
in
to
a
professor.
This
time
I
actually
had
to
state
a
point
of
view,
give
my
own
impressions
on
subjects
I
was
not
particularly
familiar
with,
and
actually
convince
people
of
my
thesis.
That
proved
to
be
a
very
interesting
challenge,
and
I
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it.
As
organized
as
my
writing
had
become,
it
needed
polishing.
In
doing
so,
I
created
my
own
writing
style,
combining
the
old
trends
I
was
familiar
with,
along
with
the
new
trends
that
I
came
in
touch
with
in
college.
The
second
English
class
I
took
in
college
proved
to
be
a
further
challenge
to
me.
Aside
from
my
brushes
with
poetry,
I
had
barely
done
any
creative
writing
on
my
own.
When
I
joined
English
110,
and
learned
that
we
would
be
doing
creative
writing,
I
was
filled
with
a
mixture
of
exhilaration
and
fear.
Exhilaration
because
I
wanted
to
create
something
completely
different
from
what
I
had
been
doing
so
far.
This
class
would
give
me
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
Fear,
because
I
did
not
know
if
the
creative
spark
was
still
alive
within
me.
It
was
quite
hard
for
me
at
the
beginning
This
English
class
forced
me
to
concentrate
on
my
creativity
and
imagination.
The
spark
had
to
be
lit
again.
It
was
a
wonderful
exercise,
in
which
I
learned
how
to
let
go,
how
to
follow
my
own
ideas,
and
shape
them
into
stories,
journals,
or
anecdotes.
I
enjoyed
this
class
immensely,
because
it
forced
me
to
get
reacquainted
with
a
side
of
my
writing
that
had
been
left
behind.
Also,
now
I
could
incorporate
the
scholarly
side
of
my
writing
with
the
creative
side,
therefore
creating
a
new,
completely
different
set
of
assignments.
I
still
had
a
lot
to
learn.
My
first
history
class
taught
me
the
difference
between
writing
English
papers
and
history
papers.
The
format,
the
methodology
were
completely
different.
My
experience
with
this
history
class
enabled
me
to
discern
the
differences
in
methods
and
objectives
of
each
field.
I
was
finally
able
to
understand
the
methodology
involved
in
a
research
paper.
I
was
also
able
to
apply
that
knowledge
constantly.
Also,
I
took
the
opportunity
in
college
to
write
papers
in
my
own
language.
I
joined
an
upper-level
Spanish
class,
which
allowed
me
to
read
and
write
about
several
Spanish
authors,
and
also
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
apply
all
my
newfound
knowledge
in
a
Spanish
setting.
This
was
an
interesting
challenge,
for
writing
a
paper
in
Spanish
involves
a
somewhat
new
set
of
rules,
combining
the
knowledge
I
acquired
in
my
English
assignments
with
the
differences
present
in
the
Spanish
language.
I
further
enhanced
my
experience
when
I
went
to
Europe
for
a
semester.
This
journey
introduced
me
to
a
different
style
of
writing.
European
professors
have
a
distinct
technique
for
teaching,
which
in
turn
influences
the
sort
of
written
assignments
that
they
expect
from
a
student.
Their
writing
assignments
tend
to
be
more
narrow,
which
helps
the
student
to
become
focused
on
just
one
aspect
of
the
theme
involved.
Of
course,
this
involves
a
much
deeper
analysis
of
the
topic
at
hand.
I
found
this
training
to
be
extremely
useful,
as
it
helped
me
to
stay
focused
on
one
issue,
without
expanding
into
other
unrelated
subjects.
My
most
recent
lesson
in
writing
was
in
the
Economics
department.
I
had
written
papers
for
English,
history,
government,
sciences,
even
a
couple
of
reports
for
a
previous
economics
class.
However,
I
did
not
have
extensive
experience
with
scholarly
economics
papers.
Since
I
was
used
to
the
different
methods
involved
in
the
previous
fields
that
I
had
studied,
I
was
not
completely
unprepared
for
the
changes
in
methodology.
However,
I
still
had
to
learn
the
proper
methodology
for
writing
successful
economics
assignments.
After
a
semester
of
hard
work,
I
became
accustomed
to
this
new
technique.
As
my
writing
assignments
have
increased
during
my
college
career,
and
the
themes
involved
a
much
greater
variety
of
subjects,
I
have
learned
how
to
be
methodic
in
my
research
and
my
writing.
The
practice
of
doing
papers
at
the
last
minute
did
not
suit
me
from
the
beginning.
I
attempted
it
a
couple
of
times
at
the
beginning
of
my
college
years,
and
understood
that
such
a
practice
did
not
work
for
me.
I
got
too
nervous
and
the
results
were
not
particularly
favorable.
I
began
to
set
my
own
deadlines,
and
to
follow
my
own
schedule
for
brainstorming,
researching,
doing
drafts,
and
finally
presenting
a
polished
finished
paper.
All
the
hard
work
has
paid
off
so
far.
The
papers
I
have
presented
so
far
demonstrate
the
effort
that
I
have
put
into
them,
and
the
professors
I
have
had
have
been
very
pleased
with
the
results.
