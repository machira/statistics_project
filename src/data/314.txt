Literary
Narrative
Fall
2001
I
remember
from
even
very
early
on
in
my
childhood
that
I
have
always
had
a
very
active
imagination.
My
family
still
teases
me
about
the
songs
I
used
to
write,
the
imaginary
friends
I
had,
and
the
elaborate
stories
I
would
construct
about
these
imaginary
people.
They
always
tell
me
about
how
I
could
entertain
them
for
hours
with
my
stories.
I
suppose
somewhere
along
the
way
my
creativity
took
the
form
of
writing
and
I
began
to
write
little
stories
and
draw
pictures
to
illustrate
them.
I
always
loved
to
read
and
write.
My
parents
read
to
me
all
the
time
when
I
was
a
child,
which
is
where
my
love
of
reading
began.
I
have
always
done
well
with
grammar
and
working
to
develop
my
vocabulary,
which
I
suppose,
in
combination
with
my
creativity,
translated
into
becoming
a
good
writer.
If
I
had
to
pinpoint
it,
I
would
have
say
that
I
really
began
to
think
of
English
as
one
of
my
favorite
school
subjects
at
the
end
of
sixth
grade.
Prior
to
this
point
I
had
done
very
well
in
English,
but
still
did
not
think
too
much
of
it
and
preferred
my
history
classes.
My
sixth
grade
teacher
gave
everyone
in
the
class
a
different
award
for
something
that
we
excelled
in,
and
for
me
that
was
the
best
in
literature.
I
think
something
about
it
must
have
gone
to
my
head
because
I
started
to
enjoy
it
more
and
more.
When
I
was
in
eighth
grade
we
all
had
to
write
short
stories
for
our
writing
assignment.
A
couple
of
weeks
later,
our
English
teacher
surprised
us
by
nominating
several
of
us
for
a
scholastic
writing
award
and
reading
to
the
class
those
which
he
considered
to
be
the
best
stories.
Mine
was
one
of
those
nominated;
however,
it
failed
to
win
any
awards.
At
first
I
felt
discouraged,
but
eventually
I
bounced
back
when
I
continued
to
do
well
on
papers
in
high
school.
I
did
well
in
my
English
and
writing
classes
in
high
school,
but
then
when
I
got
to
college,
I
was
thrown
for
a
complete
loop.
In
FYS
I
was
in
for
a
rude
awakening
and
when
I
got
the
grade
back
on
my
first
paper,
it
was
like
a
slap
in
the
face.
I
thought
I
was
a
good
writer
when
I
got
to
college,
but
after
my
first
writing
experience
there
I
seriously
began
to
think
otherwise.
All
of
these
feelings
of
self-doubt
began
to
slowly
subside
as
the
year
went
on
and
my
writing
improved.
In
fact,
my
FYS
professor
nominated
me
to
apply
to
be
a
Writing
Associate
for
the
next
year.
I
debated
back
and
forth
and
finally
applied,
but
I
had
no
grand
hopes
of
actually
being
picked.
Considering
that
there
were
twice
as
many
applicants
as
positions
available,
I
was
not
shocked
when
I
did
not
get
it.
Looking
back
now
I
am
glad
that
I
did
apply,
but
I
realize
that
I
was
not
ready
for
the
position.
I
realize
now
that
first
I
had
to
grow
as
a
writer
before
I
could
help
others
improve.
By
learning
from
my
mistakes,
my
writing
style
improved
and
changed
over
the
course
of
my
freshmen
year
to
eventually
achieve
the
college
level
standard.
Throughout
my
high
school
and
college
writing
career,
I
have
been
asked
to
produce
different
styles
of
writing.
I
have
found
that
the
types
that
I
prefer
have
changed
over
the
years,
as
my
writing
style
has
matured.
In
the
past
I
have
been
assigned
to
write
poetry,
creative
writing
pieces,
short
stories,
thesis
papers,
and
research
papers.
I
never
really
liked
to
read
or
to
write
poetry.
I
used
to
prefer
creative
writing
pieces,
but
now
I
would
much
rather
work
on
a
research
paper
or
an
analytical
paper
on
a
given
piece
of
literature.
My
preferences
now
seem
odd,
considering
my
writing
past.
It
is
funny
because
I
used
to
love
to
do
imaginative
creative
writing.
Now
I
suppose
with
experience,
maturity,
and
changes
in
my
personality
to
some
degree,
I
prefer
more
logical,
fact-based
writing
and
analysis.
Now
I
despise
free
writing
and
dread
it
when
I
have
to
do
any
type
of
creative
writing.
Even
this
type
of
paper
I
am
writing
right
now
was
somewhat
difficult
for
me
to
begin.
As
I
sit
here
and
type,
ideas
are
coming
to
me,
but
I
would
still
rather
be
writing
about
something
other
than
myself!
Regardless
of
how
good
of
a
writer
one
is,
it
is
great
to
receive
praise
from
teachers
and
professors.
In
my
mind,
my
high
school
teachers
were
not
tough
enough
on
us
and
they
seemed
to
have
babied
us
too
much.
By
doing
so,
we
were
sent
to
college
more
or
less
blindly
and
far
from
being
adequately
prepared
for
the
demands
we
were
to
be
faced
with
there.
Professors
are
far
more
critical
and
demanding
of
us,
and
for
the
most
part
they
do
not
sugar
coat
our
mistakes
to
the
extent
which
high
school
teachers
tend
to
do.
At
times
this
criticism
makes
me
doubt
my
abilities
and
it
makes
me
feel
like
I
cannot
write
at
all;
however,
in
the
end
it
is
better
for
me
because
I
must
take
it
in
stride
and
learn
from
what
they
say
to
me
when
they
comment
on
my
writing.
One
thing
that
I
have
found
to
be
extremely
helpful
is
to
go
and
talk
to
the
professor
after
receiving
a
graded
paper.
It
helps
to
understand
how
they
derived
the
particular
grade
and
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
professor's
expectations.
By
doing
so,
I
have
found
that
I
will
usually
do
better
on
the
next
assignment,
once
I
know
what
is
expected
of
me.
Unfortunately
I
am
stubborn
and
do
not
like
to
ask
for
help
at
times,
which
is
why
it
usually
takes
until
after
the
first
assignment
has
been
returned
for
me
to
go
and
ask
for
help.
In
the
spring
of
my
sophomore
year
of
college,
when
it
came
time
to
apply
to
be
a
WA,
I
basically
chickened
out.
For
some
reason
I
had
convinced
myself
that
I
was
a
terrible
writer
and
I
had
no
business
even
thinking
that
I
should
be
entrusted
with
other
students'
papers.
I
am
still
not
sure
where
this
irrational
fear
came
from
because
I
did
very
well
in
all
of
my
classes
that
semester--in
fact
it
was
one
of
my
best
semesters
in
college.
Regardless,
I
did
not
apply
for
the
position.
I
do
not
know
that
I
would
have
made
it,
but
I
still
regret
not
trying.
I
think
a
big
part
of
it
was
fear
of
rejection
and
somehow
in
my
mind
that
would
have
meant
that
I
really
cannot
write
and
then
wonder
why
I
was
an
English
major.
My
parents
and
the
rest
of
my
family
have
always
made
positive
comments
on
my
writing
ability.
It
helps
me
greatly
when
my
parents
encourage
and
praise
me.
It
seems
that
writing
is
the
one
thing
that
I
am
confident
that
I
can
do
well
and
it
really
helps
me
when
they
reinforce
it
and
they
let
me
know
that
they
are
proud
of
me.
I
remember
the
first
'A'
that
I
earned
on
a
paper
my
freshman
year
in
one
of
my
government
classes.
I
was
so
excited
when
I
called
home
and
told
my
parents.
I
remember
it
was
around
Easter
because
my
mom
told
me
to
bring
it
with
me
when
we
went
to
visit
family.
I
had
my
aunt
and
my
parents
read
it.
They
all
told
me
what
a
wonderful
paper
it
was
and
that
really
gave
me
a
great
deal
of
confidence
to
return
to
school
with.
I
still
get
excited
about
calling
home
when
I
do
well
on
a
paper,
simply
because
I
know
I
will
be
praised
by
my
parents.
Also,
I
love
to
bring
my
papers
home
for
my
parents
to
read
and
comment
on.
I
have
always
liked
it
when
we
had
to
do
peer-editing
in
classes
in
college.
I
really
do
like
reading
my
classmates'
papers
and
helping
them
when
I
am
able
to.
Also,
my
younger
brother
likes
it
when
I
read
his
papers.
During
his
senior
year
in
high
school,
he
took
some
classes,
one
of
which
was
writing,
at
a
local
community
college.
When
I
was
home
for
breaks
or
for
the
weekend,
he
always
seemed
to
have
something
for
me
to
read.
I
must
admit,
I
loved
taking
a
red
pen
and
just
making
corrections
left
and
right.
Part
of
this
is
a
bit
of
sibling
rivalry
(by
the
way,
he
will
be
attending
Lehigh
in
the
fall)--writing
and
language
is
one
of
the
things
that
I
have
always
been
better
at,
while
he
is
better
at
math
and
science.
This
is
an
excellent
example
of
much
needed
reinforcement
from
my
parents
that
I
am
a
good
writer.
One
of
the
greatest
changes
in
my
writing
is
the
manner
in
which
I
construct
papers.
When
I
was
younger
I
usually
tended
to
wait
until
close
to
the
deadline
to
start
things.
I
will
admit
it--I
am
a
procrastinator.
In
high
school
when
I
would
procrastinate,
it
caused
some
problems
at
home
because
my
parents
would
end
up
helping
me
and
my
mother
would
get
mad
because
it
was
not
done
sooner.
My
brother
does
the
same
thing
and
it
drives
our
mother
crazy.
Our
father
understands
us
a
little
bit
better
because
he
tends
to
do
the
same
thing.
We
just
happen
to
work
better
under
pressure,
which
is
a
foreign
concept
to
my
mom.
She
likes
to
have
things
done
so
she
can
relax
knowing
it
is
done.
I,
on
the
other
hand,
cannot
get
things
done
until
the
pressure
is
on.
I
know
that
this
work
method
could
possibly
cause
problems,
but
thus
far
it
is
working
out
for
me.
If
I
sit
down
to
start
a
paper
well
in
advance,
I
simply
cannot
find
the
words
with
which
to
begin
to
write.
I
open
up
a
new
word
document
and
stare
a
blank
computer
screen
for
a
while
until
I
give
up.
It
just
seems
that
I
write
better
when
I
know
that
the
pressure
is
building
and
I
have
to
get
things
done.
In
a
way
it
is
like
my
adrenaline
kicks
in
and
helps
to
get
my
thought
process
in
motion.
In
high
school,
I
used
to
sit
down
and
write
out
my
entire
paper
and
then
slowly
type
it
into
the
computer.
My
dad
would
always
tell
me
that
it
would
be
easier
if
I
would
just
type
it
and
then
make
corrections
from
there,
but
I
was
too
stubborn
to
listen,
I
guess.
Now
I
have
found
that
if
I
just
jot
down
a
few
notes
and
then
just
start
typing,
I
accomplish
much
more
and
produce
better
writing.
The
way
the
process
of
writing
a
paper
usually
goes
is
that
I
will
sit
and
think
for
a
few
minutes,
write
my
notes,
and
then
I
will
just
sit
and
type
for
an
hour
or
two
without
moving
until
the
words
stop
flowing.
My
best
friend
always
teases
me
about
my
writing
style
and
does
not
understand
how
I
am
able
to
just
sit
down
and
start
typing
like
that.
I
will
allow
myself
to
take
a
short
break
and
then
will
begin
typing
again.
Once
I
think
I
have
covered
everything
that
I
intended
to,
I
will
print
out
a
copy
of
my
paper
and
make
corrections
by
hand.
It
seems
to
me
that
I
will
catch
more
mistakes
and
be
able
to
work
on
problem
sentences
much
better
if
I
see
it
in
front
of
me,
rather
on
than
the
computer
screen
that
I
have
been
staring
at
for
hours
on
end.
After
I
make
my
revisions
by
hand,
I
type
them
in
and
make
other
corrections
as
I
go
through
the
paper.
By
this
point,
I
am
usually
sick
of
whatever
subject
I
am
writing
on,
so
I
will
put
it
aside
and
work
on
something
else
or
relax
for
a
while.
After
my
break,
I
usually
print
it
out
again
if
I
am
having
problems
with
certain
aspects
of
the
paper.
Once
I
think
I
have
all
of
my
revisions
made
I
will
usually
persist
in
reading
through
it
several
more
times
and
agonizing
over
how
I
could
make
it
better.
Not
only
am
I
a
procrastinator,
but
I
am
also
a
perfectionist.
These
two
characteristics
do
not
always
make
a
very
good
combination.
I
want
to
make
it
absolutely
perfect,
but
sometimes
there
is
not
enough
time
in
the
world
to
make
something
perfect.
In
the
back
of
my
mind,
I
know
that
no
one
is
a
perfect
writer.
It
still
drives
me
crazy
when
I
get
a
paper
back
and
the
professor
has
pointed
out
problems
that
I
overlooked
because
I
was
too
busy
worrying
about
what
I
thought
was
an
imperfect
sentence.
I
would
have
to
say
that
there
is
one
professor
in
the
English
department
that
has
had
a
tremendous
impact
on
my
college
career.
I
have
had
this
professor
for
two
classes
and
had
very
positive
experiences
in
both
of
them.
I
did
not
receive
A's
in
these
classes,
but
nonetheless,
they
were
a
couple
of
my
favorite
classes.
This
professor
had
a
great
impact
on
my
writing
and
helped
me
to
improve
greatly.
She
was
always
available
for
extra
office
hours
if
someone
needed
help
with
something.
Not
only
did
this
professor
help
my
writing,
but
also
after
taking
these
classes
I
gave
serious
consideration
to
majoring
in
English
as
well
and
Government
&
Law.
The
reason
I
focused
primarily
on
my
college
writing
is
because
that
is
where
I
feel
truly
became
a
writer.
My
experience
prior
to
that
basically
just
laid
the
foundation
for
my
future
writing
ability.
All
of
my
experiences
as
a
writer
have
led
to
where
I
am
now.
I
am
a
Writing
Associate,
which
is
a
position
that
I
had
hoped
to
get
since
my
freshman
year.
I
had
a
couple
of
really
great
WAs
that
helped
to
show
me
the
type
of
WA
that
I
would
like
to
be.
I
am
not
saying
that
I
am
so
wise
and
all
knowing,
but
I
would
like
to
think
that
my
experiences
as
a
writer
will
enable
me
to
help
others
improve
upon
their
writing
skills.
