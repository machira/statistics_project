O'Harra
Literacy
Narrative
To
begin,
I
apologize
for
the
quasi-confessional
style
in
which
I
will
proceed.
I've
no
introduction,
no
thesis,
and
little
in
the
way
of
logical
development.
In
short,
I
intend
to
present
little
more
than
a
loosely
connected
series
of
anecdotes
that
respond
to
the
queries
formulated
in
Beth's
assignment.
Maybe
it's
senior
lackadaisy,
maybe
it's
maturity,
but
what
follows
is
primarily
the
ministrations
of
a
tired,
oft
kicked
around
WA
who
knows
his
audience.
I
write
this
for
me;
this
paper
is
my
opportunity
at
introspection.
Whomever
else
may
read
it
-
enjoy.
As
an
undergraduate,
my
prose
is
bad;
I
know
this.
It's
bad
not
because
it's
unclear
(though
it
may
sometimes
be)
or
because
I
lack
linguistic
competence
but
because
it
is,
more
often
than
not,
merely
an
attempt
to
meet
my
professors'
expectations.
Placating
--
that's
my
racket.
However,
I'm
working
on
it.
I've
found,
over
the
course
of
the
last
year,
that
formulating
a
style
(a
voice,
if
you'll
excuse
the
banality)
begins
with
finding
a
mentor.
I've
been
lucky
in
that
last
year
I
met
someone
who
was
willing
to
fill
this
role.
I
was
attracted
to
the
elegance
of
this
man's
mind
and
the
humanity
of
his
prose
before
I
ever
met
him.
You
see,
I
read
an
article
in
Society
during
my
sophomore
year
entitled
Economics
and
Distributive
Ethics
by
Harold
Hochman
and
discovered,
at
the
article's
conclusion,
that
the
author
was
a
faculty
member
at
Lafayette.
While
much
of
the
piece's
substance
was
beyond
me,
I
was
impressed
by
the
author's
ability
to
enliven
the
often
pedantic
or
preachy
tone
of
social
scientific
discourse
with
a
genuine
approachability.
It's
not
that
his
writing
was
simplistic,
it
was
best
described
as
comfortable.
Booth
Tarkington,
another
writer
I
enjoy
(though
in
a
different
genre)
once
described
a
house
as
follows:
[i]t
lacks
style,
but
it
also
lacks
pretense
and
I've
always
held
that
anything
that
doesn't
have
to
pretend
at
all
has
all
the
style
it
needs.
So
too
with
Hal.
As
fortune
had
it,
the
next
week
I
was
seated
to
the
author's
immediate
left
at
a
dinner
sponsored
by
the
economics
department.
To
make
a
long
story
short,
we
became
fast
friends
and
found
we
shared
many
of
the
same
intellectual
interests.
I
don't
pretend
to
share
Hal's
erudition,
but
the
comfort
with
which
he
writes
attracts
me.
In
fact
I
often
find
my
self
reading
and
re-reading
his
scholarship
not
because
I'm
fascinated
by
optimal
taxation
schemes
or
income
transfers
but
because
his
writing
retains
wit,
social
consciousness,
and
a
charming
self-deprecation.
Further,
I
never
thought
that
I
could
emulate
his
style
or
that
it
would
rub
off
on
me.
However,
a
few
weeks
ago
I
was
told
by
one
of
Hal's
colleagues
who
was
proofing
a
report
for
me
that
my
writing
was
similar
to
his.
I
guess
I
share
this
with
you
because
my
acquaintance
with
Professor
Hochman
qualifies
as
a
recent
formative
writing
experience.
Since
I've
already
(sort
of)
shared
both
a
typical
writing
experience
(one
in
which
I
pontificate
to
appease
a
professor)
and
a
formative
one,
I
should
turn
to
the
circumstances
under
which
writing
becomes
difficult
for
me.
Situations
where
professors
presribe
strict
adherence
to
some
(often
idiosyncratic)
orthodoxy
trouble
me.
That
is
not
to
say
that
grammatical,
syntactical,
semantic,
etc.
conventions
should
not
be
maintained
but
some
professors
circulate
seven
page
manifestos
that
attempt
to
spell
out
their
expectations.
Many
professors
may
consider
a
thorough
outline
of
their
expectations
propitious
to
students
who
endeavor
to
please
them;
ironically,
however,
those
professors
hinder
students
insofar
as
they
(the
professors)
seem
to
have
too
exact
an
image
of
what
every
paper
should
look
like.
In
many
disciplines
such
conformity
may
be
required
for
professional
advancement,
but
in
the
anecdote
I'm
about
to
relay
I
could
see
no
reason
for
it.
My
most
frustrating
writing
experience
this
year
was
in
Prof.
Miller's
course
Early
American
Political
Thought.
On
the
first
day
he
distributed
a
seven
page
document
spelling
out
the
format
that
he
would
like
each
paper
to
follow.
Initially,
I
was
pleased.
It
appeared
that
the
hoops
through
which
I
would
have
to
jump
would
be
that
much
easier
because
they
were
so
clearly
defined.
However,
after
each
paper
was
returned
I
was
left
confused.
When
approached,
the
professor
would
always
simply
refer
me
to
the
lengthy
document
rather
than
offer
any
paper-specific
assistance.1
It
really
became
something
of
a
cop
out.
I'm
going
to
digress
for
a
few
lines
to
reflect
not
so
much
on
how
being
a
WA
has
helped
me
as
a
writer
(as
the
assignment
requires)
but
rather
to
discuss
a
bit
how
it
has
hurt
me.
I've
noticed
that
some
of
my
WA
colleagues
seem
to
think
that
because
they've
been
anointed
as
one
of
Beth's
apostles
they
are
beyond
literary
reproach.
In
short,
that
they
are
the
talented
tenth
when
it
comes
to
writing
on
this
campus.
While
I
would
hope
to
transcend
such
a
mentality,
I
cannot
help
but
occasionally
become
a;djfa
by
it.
Consider
this
paper:
I
know
it's
not
going
to
be
good
so
I
probably
won't
spend
much
time
proofing
it.
However,
being
a
WA
sometimes
deludes
me
into
thinking
that
I
need
not
always
proof.
In
part,
I
may
think
that
because
I
spend
so
much
time
puzzling
over
what
makes
college
writing
good
or
preaching
the
virtues
of
clear
prose,
that
I
naturally
produce
adj;lkj
on
first
attempts.
It's
a
or
sort
of
literary
hubris
that
one
develops
as
a
WA
(and
that
the
WA
program
administrators
do
little
to
debunk).
I
sometimes
think
that
had
I
not
taken
a
position
as
a
WA
I
would
consider
my
writing
ability
to
be
less
than
it
is
and
that
I
would,
consequently,
feel
obligated
to
spend
more
time
on
each
paper.
The
result
would
probably
make
for
better
writing
(and
more
humility).
Finally,
I
guess,
I
should
spend
some
time
addressing
my
experiences
as
a
WA
this
year.
I
didn't
really
get
any
lessons
in
technique
from
my
advisees.
I
did
feel
I
had
the
authority
to
help
them.
Even
when
I
question
my
competence
as
a
WA,
I
justify
the
time
and
advice
I
give
my
advisees
by
telling
myself,
I
know
this
experience
isn't
going
to
make
the
paper
any
worse.
That
is,
at
least
the
requirement
that
they
meet
with
me
has
them
thinking
about
the
project
sooner
than
they
would
otherwise.
I
also
regret
to
say
that
none
of
the
experiences
I
had
last
year
really
did
anything
to
bring
my
WA-work
into
clearer
focus.
There
were
these
two
students
in
the
first
year
seminar
for
which
I
WAed
who
I
met
with
repeatedly.
They
took
much
of
what
I
said
to
heart
and
were
(I
think)
rewarded
for
it.
However,
the
amount
of
time
I
spent
with
them
on
each
paper
(maybe
an
hour
and
a
half)
was
more
than
my
schedule
would
normally
allow.
Consequently,
I
can't
really
pretend
that
getting
these
students
to
become
better
writers
(because
I
did
notice
that
the
first
drafts
improved
as
time
progressed)
is
something
that
I
could
replicate
for
every
advisee.
To
close,
I
see
myself
beginning
this
academic
year
as
a
WA
more
set
in
my
ways
than
ever.
I'll
continue
to
be
flexible,
accessible
and
approachable
(I
hope)
while
insisting
that
my
advisees
leave
each
meeting
feeling
as
bad
about
their
writing
as
possible.
At
a
school
like
Lafayette,
so
many
feel
so
entitled
to
so
much.
I
want
them
to
leave
my
conferences
feeling
like
they're
not
going
to
get
an
A
for
two
reasons:
first,
I
don't
want
to
deal
with
recrimination
if
they
don't
succeed;
and
second,
I
don't
want
to
delude
them
into
thinking
their
writing
can't
improve.
As
I
writer,
I
hope
to
use
this
year
to
concentrate
on
simplifying
my
writing.
I
hope
to
replace
my
penchant
for
pomposities
with
a
more
direct,
more
simple
elegance.
I
would
like,
eventually,
to
go
on
to
graduate
school
but
I
think
that
too
often
meaningful
academic
dialogue
is
hindered
by
the
obfuscating
(or
sometimes
esoteric)
terms
of
professional
discourse.
If
I
can
use
my
senior
year
to
correct
some
of
this
deficiency
in
myself,
I
would
be
pleased.
Wish
me
luck!
