New
Writing
Associate
Essay
Looking
back
on
my
years
of
education,
it
is
hard
to
recall
when
I
began
writing.
I
do
not
know
the
first
time
I
picked
up
a
pencil
and
actually
formed
letters,
or
words,
or
even
sentences.
I
do
not
know
when
I
first
used
such
words
to
tell
a
story.
It
is
quite
difficult
to
pinpoint
the
first
time
I
completed
a
paper.
Yet,
amongst
all
the
ambiguity
of
my
history
as
a
writer,
several
distinct
memories
have
remained
intact.
It
is
these
moments
that
have
helped
me
to
develop
into
the
writer
I
am
today.
Like
most
people,
my
writing
career
began
in
elementary
school.
During
the
first
years
of
elementary
school,
writing
was
used
as
a
tool
to
describe
pictures.
I
remember
having
to
draw
a
picture
and
write
a
few
sentences
about
it
underneath
the
picture.
Using
crayons
and
the
little
vocabulary
that
I
knew
at
the
time,
I
attempted
to
form
a
coherent
sentence
or
two.
Soon
this
progressed
to
writing
several
sentences
at
a
time
to
describe
things
that
were
happening
in
my
life
as
opposed
to
describing
a
picture.
For
instance,
every
Monday
in
class
we
were
required
to
write
about
the
past
weekend.
One
memory
of
my
grammar
school
years
that
has
always
stuck
out
is
that
each
year
a
friend
of
mine
would
give
me
a
diary
for
my
birthday.
I
wrote
in
these
diaries
every
night
before
I
went
to
bed.
I
would
write
about
the
events
of
my
life,
and
any
interesting
thoughts
I
may
have
had.
Looking
back,
I
feel
that
it
was
these
diaries
that
taught
me
to
open
up
and
bring
my
personal
life
in
to
my
writing.
In
junior
high
school,
my
writing
abilities
shined
through,
both
in
and
out
of
school.
During
my
first
year
of
junior
high,
my
family
purchased
a
Brother
Word
Processor.
I
was
in
awe
of
this
new
typing
machine.
I
began
to
type
constantly,
therefore
constantly
thinking
of
new
things
to
write
about
so
that
I
could
use
the
machine.
Each
week
I
would
think
of
a
new
story
to
tell.
I
would
sit
at
the
Word
Processor
and
watch
as
the
words
would
unfold.
I
would
turn
the
blank
screen
in
to
a
marvelous
tale.
My
imagination
ran
wild,
as
I
realized
that
through
my
writings,
I
could
be
anyone
that
I
wanted
to
be.
Most
characters
I
created
lived
lives
of
which
I
had
only
dreamed,
while
others
dealt
with
the
same
issues
I
was
dealing
with
in
my
life
at
the
time.
To
me,
the
Word
Processor
was
magic.
I
thought
that
it
could
bring
me
into
new
worlds.
It
was
only
later
in
life
that
I
realized
it
was
I
who
brought
myself
into
these
worlds,
through
the
magic
of
writing.
Although
most
of
my
narratives
were
created
for
my
own
personal
amusement,
my
writing
abilities
were
also
required
in
class
during
junior
high.
I
found
sixth
grade
assignments
to
be
quite
easy.
The
majority
of
the
writing
assigned
consisted
of
using
vocabulary
words
correctly
in
sentences.
I
was
often
asked
to
write
my
sentences
on
the
chalkboard
to
show
the
rest
of
the
class,
since
the
teacher
knew
that
my
sentences
would
be
properly
constructed.
I
took
pride
in
the
fact
that
the
teacher
was
using
my
work
as
an
example.
My
sixth
grade
teacher
was
also
a
stickler
for
grammar.
She
drilled
the
class
with
grammar
exercises
each
day,
until
the
entire
class
had
learned
the
point
she
was
attempting
to
make.
It
was
at
this
time
that
I
began
correcting
the
grammar
of
all
those
around
me.
My
father
made
a
deal
with
me
that
every
time
he
used
the
word
good
instead
of
well,
he
would
pay
me
a
nickel.
The
deal
only
lasted
a
day
or
two
because
he
was
slowly
going
broke!
To
this
day,
I
thank
my
sixth
grade
teacher
for
all
of
her
countless
grammar
drills.
Over
the
next
few
years,
my
assigned
writing
progressed
on
to
essays
and
papers
much
more
formal
than
the
vocabulary
sentences
of
sixth
grade.
In
order
to
prepare
for
standardized
tests,
all
seventh
graders
were
required
to
take
a
writing
course.
The
course
focused
mainly
on
different
types
of
essays,
including
persuasive
writing
and
compare
and
contrast
essays.
I
thrived
in
the
course.
I
distinctly
remember
how
impressed
the
teacher
was
with
my
writing
ability.
Another
major
writing
development
during
my
middle
school
career
involved
an
extra
curricular
activity,
the
school
yearbook.
After
writing
articles
for
the
yearbook
for
two
years,
I
was
selected
as
the
copy
editor.
With
this
position,
I
was
in
control
of
all
articles
to
be
published
in
the
yearbook.
I
helped
decide
what
topics
to
write
about
and
to
whom
the
articles
would
be
assigned.
In
addition,
all
articles
were
handed
in
to
me
to
proof,
edit,
and
make
any
necessary
changes.
The
experience
as
a
copy
editor
further
helped
develop
my
editing
skills,
which
I
would
learn
to
use
on
my
own
work
as
well
as
the
work
of
others.
As
I
approached
high
school,
my
workload
became
much
more
intense
and
my
writing
abilities
were
required
more
than
ever.
Once
again,
I
used
my
writing
skills
for
work
assigned
in
school
as
well
as
in
my
personal
life.
Often
during
my
high
school
years,
my
father
would
ask
me
to
look
over
my
older
sister's
writing.
Although
several
years
older
than
I,
and
already
in
college,
my
sister's
writing
skills
were
not
as
well
developed
as
mine.
As
I
would
proofread
the
papers,
I
thought
of
my
sixth
grade
teacher
who
had
so
diligently
drilled
me
in
grammar.
I
wondered
if
my
sister
would
have
still
needed
help
editing
her
papers
if
she
had
also
had
the
same
teacher.
Not
only
was
I
asked
to
correct
simple
grammar
mistakes,
but
I
was
also
asked
to
provide
suggestions
on
the
overall
papers.
The
faith
that
my
sister
and
father
had
in
me
to
read
and
edit
her
papers
helped
me
to
further
build
the
confidence
I
had
in
my
writing
skills.
The
editorial
skills
I
used
in
correcting
my
sister's
papers
assisted
me
later
in
high
school
as
well.
When
I
was
selected
as
editor
in
chief
of
the
high
school
yearbook,
such
skills
were
once
again
necessitated.
My
experience
as
the
copy
editor
of
my
middle
school
yearbook
had
helped
prepare
me
for
my
new
position.
As
before,
I
had
to
bring
my
writing
skills
in
to
an
extra
curricular
activity.
Once
again,
I
was
in
charge
of
all
the
written
material
to
be
published.
I
felt
a
great
boost
of
self-confidence
as
I
read
the
final,
printed
version
of
the
book,
knowing
that
my
writing
and
editing
skills
were
responsible.
Another
major
step
in
my
writing
career
occurred
when
I
was
asked
to
write
an
inspirational
speech
for
a
religious
retreat.
The
speech
was
to
be
composed
of
personal
anecdotes
and
lessons
I
had
learned
throughout
my
life.
I
thought
back
to
the
many
years
of
diaries
in
which
I
had
divulged
my
personal
life
onto
paper.
The
main
difference
was
that
my
diaries
were
confidential,
whereas
the
speech
would
be
presented
to
over
one
hundred
of
my
peers.
Also,
the
secret
crushes
that
I
wrote
of
in
my
elementary
school
days
could
not
rival
the
serious
life
problems
of
my
adolescence.
Yet,
I
decided
to
accept
the
offer
and
give
a
speech
at
the
retreat,
hoping
that
my
words
could
help
others
to
deal
with
situations
in
their
own
lives.
The
final
version
of
my
speech
was
approximately
thirteen
pages
long.
When
I
read
of
the
trials
and
triumphs
of
my
life
to
the
large
group
of
individuals
in
front
of
me,
time
seemed
to
stand
still.
I
was
opening
up
to
all
of
these
people,
and
it
was
my
writing
that
had
allowed
me
to
do
so.
Many
people
cried
during
my
speech
because
it
had
touched
them
so
deeply.
After
my
speech
was
over,
I
was
swarmed
with
compliments,
as
countless
people
told
me
how
they
related
to
my
speech,
or
how
much
they
admired
me.
It
seemed
that
my
once
daily
ritual
of
writing
in
diaries
throughout
my
youth
had
apparently
prepared
me
to
reveal
my
innermost
thoughts
and
feelings
to
the
world.
With
my
speech,
I
realized
that
not
only
could
writing
help
me
deal
with
problems
in
my
personal
life,
but
it
could
also
be
used
to
help
others.
I
discovered
that
I
could
use
my
writing
to
touch
others
in
ways
that
I
had
previously
not
been
aware
existed.
In
addition,
I
realized
how
helpful
it
was
for
me
to
deal
with
the
trials
of
my
own
life
through
writing.
I
have
since
written
about
many
hard
times
in
order
to
help
myself
cope
and
work
through
such
problems.
Besides
the
several
ways
in
which
I
used
writing
in
my
personal
life
during
high
school,
it
was
also
a
tool
widely
used
in
the
classroom.
More
than
ever
before,
term
papers,
essays
and
all
types
of
reports
were
being
demanded
of
me.
In
addition,
"essay
tests"
were
introduced.
Such
tests
consisted
of
three
to
four
essays
to
be
completed
in
a
forty-five
minute
period.
Some
would
even
include
several
readings
on
which
the
essays
were
to
be
based,
all
to
be
read
within
the
same
amount
of
time.
My
advanced
placement
history
teacher
used
only
essay
tests.
In
order
to
help
us
prepare
for
this
testing
method,
she
informed
us
of
how,
in
her
view,
an
essay
should
be
written.
She
compared
a
well-written
essay
to
a
court
case.
She
explained
that
the
thesis
of
the
paper
should
be
like
the
opening
argument
of
the
case,
presenting
the
idea
to
be
discussed,
and
giving
some
indication
of
how
it
will
be
proven.
The
body
of
the
paper
should
include
evidence
towards
the
thesis.
In
many
papers,
such
as
a
research
paper
and
most
essays,
the
evidence
should
include
direct
quotations.
The
teacher
described
that
when
enough
evidence
has
been
presented
to
prove
the
case,
the
concluding
statement
should
be
presented.
Similar
to
the
opening
arguments,
the
concluding
statement
should
state
what
was
just
presented
and
how
it
was
proved
throughout
the
paper.
The
analogy
of
a
paper
and
court
case
has
always
stuck
with
me,
and
I
still
it
in
mind
each
time
I
sit
down
to
write
a
paper.
Perhaps
it
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
government
and
law
is
now
one
of
my
majors!
When
junior
year
of
high
school
rolled
around,
it
was
time
to
begin
applying
both
to
colleges
and
for
local
scholarships.
I
soon
learned
that
this
process
would
call
upon
my
writing
abilities.
Each
application
required
a
written
essay,
many
either
asking
to
describe
a
personal
experience,
or
highlight
my
own
specific
characteristics
and
qualifications.
Often,
there
was
the
option
of
writing
a
more
formal
generic
essay.
Since
I
had
learned
to
freely
write
about
myself
and
my
experiences
in
the
past,
both
through
the
diaries
of
my
youth
and
the
speech
I
had
written
for
the
religious
retreat,
I
felt
adequately
prepared
for
such
assignments
and
chose
to
write
about
my
personal
life.
For
many
of
my
college
applications,
I
wrote
either
about
being
diagnosed
with
a
chronic
illness
as
a
teenager,
or
about
a
volunteer
trip
I
had
taken
to
Kentucky
to
build
homes
for
the
less
fortunate.
Having
lived
the
actual
experiences,
I
felt
that
I
had
plenty
of
information
for
such
topics.
After
being
accepted
to
many
good
colleges
and
awarded
with
numerous
excellent
scholarships,
I
realized
that
I
had
apparently
made
the
correct
choice
in
writing
about
these
things.
I
felt
as
though
my
writing
abilities
were
being
applauded
by
others
each
time
I
received
a
new
scholarship
or
acceptance
letter.
While
preparing
for
college
during
my
senior
year
of
high
school,
I
decided
to
take
the
writing
SAT
II.
Eventually
this
would
be
an
act
that
would
boost
my
confidence
as
a
writer.
Although
while
writing
the
actual
essays
of
the
exam
I
was
unsure
of
how
well
I
was
doing,
I
was
reassured
the
day
I
received
my
scores
in
the
mail.
Out
of
a
possible
800
points,
I
had
scored
a
790.
Only
ten
points
away
from
a
perfect
score!
I
could
not
believe
my
eyes.
After
re-reading
the
scoring
instructions
several
times,
I
realized
that
I
had
actually
achieved
such
a
phenomenal
score.
Teachers
had
been
telling
me
for
years
that
I
had
excellent
writing
skills,
and
now
a
standardized
test
was
confirming
it.
With
all
the
confidence
in
my
writing
that
I
had
gained
in
the
past,
I
felt
decently
prepared
for
college,
but
was
still
uncertain
of
what
was
to
come.
I
figured
that
I
would
simply
write
the
same
way
as
I
had
always
done,
at
least
until
someone
told
me
to
change.
If
my
writing
style
had
worked
in
the
past,
I
reasoned,
it
should
also
work
in
college
as
well.
My
FYS
professor
seemed
to
be
quite
strict
and
I
thought
that
he
would
be
a
very
tough
grader.
I
hoped
that
he
would
appreciate
my
work,
as
the
teachers
of
my
past
had,
but
was
still
quite
tentative
when
handing
in
my
first
paper.
After
receiving
a
good
grade
on
the
paper,
I
was
relieved
and
decided
that
the
style
of
writing
to
which
I
had
become
accustomed
works
and
I
would
stick
with
it.
A
recent
memory
highlighting
my
writing
abilities
in
college
occurred
one
morning,
while
blow
drying
my
hair.
I
suddenly
remembered
that
I
had
an
essay
due
in
class
that
morning.
I
had
ten
minutes.
My
roommate
looked
at
me
in
shock
and
asked
"What
are
you
going
to
do?
Are
you
going
to
skip
class?"
As
I
started
my
computer,
I
responded,
"no,
I
am
going
to
write
it
now."
As
she
looked
at
me
in
awe,
I
proceeded
to
write
my
essay.
Within
ten
minutes,
I
blew
my
hair
dry
and
wrote
my
essay,
and
arrived
to
class
on
time.
When
I
got
the
essay
back
a
week
later,
my
roommate
was
furious.
Although
we
usually
congratulated
each
other
on
good
grades,
she
started
screaming
at
me.
She
was
upset
that
I
had
spent
ten
minutes
to
write
on
essay,
while
blow
drying
my
hair
at
the
same
time,
and
had
received
an
A
on
the
paper.
I
attempted
to
explain
that
writing
just
came
easily
to
me,
but
she
still
could
not
quite
comprehend
the
idea.
Perhaps
the
essay
tests
I
became
accustomed
to
in
high
school
helped
prepare
me
to
work
under
such
pressure
and
lack
of
time.
This
incident
helped
me
to
realize
how
lucky
I
am
that
I
have
the
ability
to
sit
at
a
computer
and
formulate
several
ideas
in
to
a
well
written
essay,
even
with
a
time
constraint.
College
life
has
demanded
numerous
writing
assignments
of
me,
yet
I
feel
that
I
have
handled
them
quite
well.
Looking
back
on
my
writing
history,
I
see
that
it
is
exactly
that
which
has
provided
me
with
the
necessary
skills
to
excel
in
college.
When
others
complain
about
having
to
write
fifteen
page
papers,
I
think
of
the
ten
page
ones
that
were
required
of
me
in
high
school
and
realize
that
the
extra
five
pages
do
not
warrant
any
concern.
I
use
the
court
case
analogy
whenever
an
essay
is
presented
to
me,
and
think
of
the
stories
I
would
write
on
my
Word
Processor
each
time
I
am
assigned
a
narrative.
The
various
opportunities
I
have
had
in
the
past
to
write
of
my
personal
life
have
allowed
me
to
connect
my
personal
experiences
with
my
writing
when
necessary.
In
addition,
my
experiences
of
editing
both
yearbook
articles
and
my
sister's
papers
have
helped
me
to
edit
my
own
work.
As
I
enter
my
junior
year
of
college
and
prepare
to
be
a
writing
associate,
I
once
again
question
whether
or
not
my
abilities
will
be
sufficient.
With
such
doubts
in
mind,
I
think
of
the
many
occasions
when
my
work
was
admired,
either
by
my
peers,
family,
professors,
or
even
standardized
tests.
I
look
back
on
my
writing
history
and
note
that
my
writing
abilities
have
always
been
up
to
par.
I
have
come
a
long
way
since
the
sentences
I
would
write
crayons
in
elementary
school.
Whereas
my
writing
career
began
by
describing
pictures,
I
realize
that
now
it
is
my
words
that
create
the
pictures.
