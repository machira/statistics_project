WA
Literacy
Narrative
8
August
2008
In
preparation
for
writing
this
assignment,
I
reread
my
literacy
narrative
from
last
year.
Six
pages
or
so
seemed
barely
enough
to
chronicle
my
literary
life
from
kindergarten
through
freshman
year
of
college;
but
now,
the
analysis
of
one
year
seems
inadequate
material
and
filling
seven
pages
a
daunting
task.
What
have
I
learned
from
this?
Obviously
I
should
not
reread
my
old
papers!
However,
in
briefly
reliving
my
writing
evolution,
I
had
a
flash
of
insight:
this
reflection
on
my
literacy
history
of
the
past
year
is
not
going
to
be
a
dictatorial,
paint
by
numbers
assessment
of
my
experience
as
a
Writing
Associate
and
the
expectations
a
new
WA
should
have.
Rather,
this
is
going
to
be
a
somewhat
loosely
linked,
possibly
boring,
exploration
of
what
I
learned
as
a
writer
and
how
my
role
as
a
WA
contributed
to
my
current
literacy
status:
still
working
on
it.
So
let
me
begin
with
the
first
semester.
My
fall
classes
were
not
very
writing-centric.
Psychology
lab
reports
were
the
only
written
assignments
I
had,
and
I
admit
I
spent
more
time
than
was
necessary
making
sure
each
section
was
the
best
example
of
Nscientific
writingO
that
I
could
produce.
As
a
science
major
with
a
closet
life
as
a
Writing
Associate,
I
came
to
fully
appreciate
the
need
for
good
writing
in
a
science
class.
It
was
my
first
experience
with
lab
reports,
and
I
attacked
the
writing
process
somewhat
like
a
gem
cutter
looking
at
a
diamond,
paying
attention
to
the
NcutO
or
format,
always
going
for
a
little
color,
clarity
above
all
else,
and
realizing
that
while
the
length
(carat?)
was
important,
content
took
precedence.
I
realized
that
there
is
no
difference
between
good
writing
and
good
NscientificO
writing:
for
the
task
to
be
well-executed,
the
writer
must
make
his
or
her
points,
support
them
with
clear
evidence,
and
engage
with
the
reader
as
the
argument
unfolds.
As
I
developed
my
scientific
writing
style,
I
also
developed
a
pet
peeve
along
with
it.
To
my
mind,
writing
a
lab
report
is
not
that
different
than
writing
a
critical
analysis
of
Shakespeare,
yet
I
was
always
surprised
at
the
mental
block
many
students
had
erected
when
it
came
to
applying
their
considerable
communication
skills
to
documenting
a
psychology
experiment.
Many
classmates
and
some
students
I
worked
with
in
my
capacity
as
a
WA
felt
that
Ngood
writingO
had
no
place
in
science,
and
likewise,
that
science
didnOt
care
for
the
niceties
of
composition
such
as
metaphor,
flow,
illustrative
examples,
or
(gasp!)
English-y
vocabulary
words.
I
say
it
now,
and
must
have
said
it
in
every
conference:
just
because
itOs
fact
does
not
mean
it
must
be
dry.
In
the
fall
semester,
I
counted
on
my
work
as
a
WA
to
help
my
keep
my
head
in
the
writing
game
since
I
had
so
few
opportunities
to
write
myself.
I
think
this
helped
me
in
a
few
ways.
First,
it
put
a
little
distance
between
me
and
the
task;
I
found
it
easier
to
workshop
with
student
writers
when
my
own
deadlines
werenOt
breathing
down
my
neck.
I
stifled
the
impulse
to
provide
quick
fixes
that
I
knew
I
would
look
for
in
their
position,
and
took
the
time
to
conscientiously
evaluate
each
writer
and
his
or
her
desired
areas
of
improvement.
There
were
16
students
in
the
class
I
worked
with,
and
among
them,
I
think
I
encountered
every
writing
NdonOtO
that
we
discussed
in
staff
meetings
as
well
as
a
few
new
ones.
That
said,
I
also
read
amazing,
thoughtful,
and
insightful
intellectual
efforts
and
had
the
supreme
satisfaction
of
watching
the
students
gain
confidence
in
their
own
voices
and
abilities.
Also,
I
found
it
easier
to
work
with
students
who
did
not
consider
themselves
Nwriters,O
classifying
themselves
as
engineers,
math,
or
science
students
instead.
Given
my
own
experience
with
science
and
writing,
I
could
sympathize
with
their
self-doubts.
Maybe
my
ever-present
chemistry
and
statistics
books
put
the
literary
skittish
more
at
ease.
I
like
to
think
it
was
my
warm
and
winning
smile.
Whatever
the
reason,
I
had
a
much
easier
time
convincing
students
that
they
could,
in
fact,
competently
produce
five
to
seven
pages
of
a
coherent,
cohesive
thesis
that
even
they
could
stand
to
read
and
reread.
Finally,
but
most
important
to
my
personal
writing
development,
I
found
myself
questioning
whether
I
honestly
put
as
much
effort
into
analyzing
my
writing
style
and
process
as
these
students
did.
Although
it
took
some
persuasion
at
times,
I
was
always
impressed
by
the
way
student
writers
would
lay
their
literary
souls
bare
to
praise
or
censure
from
a
peer.
After
a
round
of
conferences,
I
would
sometimes
go
reread
papers
from
my
past
classes
and
in
a
fit
of
inspired
energy,
produce
revision
facelifts
for
even
Joan
Rivers
to
envy:
tightened
loose
ends,
smoothed
wrinkles,
and
an
overall
fresh
and
exuberant
appearance.
I
really
enjoyed
getting
to
know
the
students
in
the
class
as
writers
with
a
history,
not
just
the
people
who
produced
whatever
draft
was
in
front
of
me.
There
were
some
challenges
for
me
as
a
WA
that
I
had
never
encountered
as
a
writer
or
reviewer.
One
girl
was
an
international
student
who
had
never
actually
written
a
paper
before;
her
schooling
experience
up
until
Lafayette
had
consisted
mostly
of
standardized
exam
courses.
Another
struggled
with
writing
in
English
as
second
or
third
language.
Some
looked
as
though
tears
might
ensue
if
I
made
any
criticism.
Others
dared
me
to
criticize,
if
I
had
the
nerve
to
question
them.
In
each
case,
I
had
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board.
A
lot
of
the
time,
I
doubted
my
own
authority.
The
students
respected
my
status
for
what
it
was,
a
peer
reviewer,
but
also
seemed
to
grant
me
more
credit
for
knowing
what
I
was
talking
about
than
I
did
sometimes.
However,
navigating
my
way
to
providing
helpful
answers
to
their
questions
certainly
helped
my
confidence,
as
did
the
conviction
that
despite
what
Mrs.
Whoever
had
said
in
high
school,
certain
things
were
not
acceptable
in
a
college
level
paper.
Looking
back,
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
seems
almost
like
a
fairytale.
It
wasnOt,
but
hindsight
is
20-20.
Somewhere
between
the
thrice-rescheduled
conferences,
the
so-broad-it-becomes-limiting-because-I-have-no-idea-where-or-what-to-start-writing-about
prompts,
and
the
occasional
difficult
customer
(read:
didnOt
give
a
damn)
I
was
able
to
distill
the
more
important
and
valuable
aspects
of
the
experience.
Namely,
I
learned
how
to
read
a
paper
and
identify
weak
points,
how
to
talk
someone
through
a
solid
outline
or
brainstorming
session,
how
to
apply
what
I
learned
to
my
own
writing,
and
how
to
share
the
tips
I
learned
in
a
way
that
would
do
more
than
resolve
the
immediate
issue.
In
the
spring
semester,
I
had
two
writing
classes,
my
VAST
and
Literary
Questions.
Both
were
also
discussion
based,
which
I
knew
from
my
experience
as
a
WA
was
a
great
way
to
go
about
beginning
the
writing
process.
My
experience
in
both
continued
to
shape
me
as
a
writer
as
I
learned
to
meet
texts
in
a
new
way,
and
in
fact
to
meet
new
texts,
period.
The
VAST
I
took
was
Influenza
Pandemics.
We
read
a
variety
of
texts,
including
childrenOs
books,
medical
journal
articles,
historical
nonfiction,
and
some
medical
philosophy.
We
also
viewed
several
films,
both
educational
and
Hollywood,
and
critically
analyzed
the
content
of
corporate
and
commercial
websites.
From
the
sheer
range
of
material,
not
to
mention
the
subject
matter,
this
class
forced
me
to
hone
my
integration
skills.
It
was
a
different
experience
for
me
to
write
about
web
sites,
movies,
novels,
and
nonfiction
on
the
same
level.
The
texts
were
linked
sometimes
only
by
the
common
theme
of
influenza,
which
forced
me
to
look
at
the
unusual
mediums
for
something
more
than
their
face-value.
I
enjoyed
digging
into
the
hidden
or
underlying
messages
given
by
such
use
of
a
relatively
common
disease.
My
final
project,
which
I
really
got
into,
analyzed
a
series
of
texts
across
several
mediums
in
terms
of
the
way
they
portrayed
disease
and
societyOs
ability
to
cope
with
it.
This
type
of
writing
was
really
helpful
in
terms
of
developing
my
ability
to
see
and
intelligently
write
about
the
big
picture,
something
that
most
writing
classes
teach
students
to
avoid
because
with
the
big
picture
comes
the
danger
of
generality.
Having
the
overarching
theme
of
influenza
pandemics,
though
at
first
seeming
a
bit
limiting,
actually
provided
a
framework
that
forced
me
to
polish
my
writing
style.
The
structure
of
my
essay
writing
evolved
from
chronicling
broad,
general
topics
to
developing
and
building
specific
discussion
points
within
a
focused
essay.
My
analysis
of
literature
and
media
grew
exponentially,
going
from
focusing
mostly
on
subject
matter
exclusively
within
the
structure
of
a
work
to
a
thoughtful
analysis
based
on
a
workOs
place
in
a
larger
social
context.
In
addition,
short
papers
routinely
challenged
me
to
consider
the
impact
of
my
expectations
by
requiring
a
conscientious
compare-contrast
style
evaluation
of
my
impressions
before
and
after
reading
a
work.
This
was
a
theme
that
my
Literary
Questions
class
explored
on
a
daily
basis,
and
in
fact
sometimes
discussion
about
paratext
went
for
a
week.
In
this
class,
we
started
with
three
questions:
what
is
literature,
how
do
we
read
it,
and
how
do
we
write
about
it.
Pretty
straightforward,
right?
Wrong.
Not
only
did
it
turn
my
entire
previous
English
education
on
its
head,
this
class
opened
my
eyes
to
a
much
broader
spectrum
of
what
we
call
Nliterature.O
Oddly
enough
I
ended
up
doing
a
little
psychology
along
the
wayNand
I
learned
to
dissect
some
texts
as
scientifically
as
a
lab
report.
We
started
the
course
with
The
White
Hotel,
and
I
really
had
no
idea
what
I
was
getting
into.
It
was
actually
the
perfect
point
from
which
to
begin
building
my
grasp
of
different
modes
of
critical
analysis,
as
I
learned
that
analyzing
my
reader
response
and
its
evolution
was
a
valid
approach
to
understanding
a
text.
We
read
a
variety
of
texts,
only
one
of
which
could
be
safely
considered
part
of
the
accepted
canon
of
literature.
But
realizing
that
NliteratureO
is
a
nebulous,
undefined,
and
highly
debatable
label
for
a
work
was
perhaps
the
most
valuable
lesson
I
could
have
learned.
I
also
learned
that
reading
different
texts
in
different
ways
is
as
important
in
shaping
my
writing
as
actually
writing
about
them.
New
modes
of
critical
analysis
challenged
me
to
write
in
new
ways,
some
more
comfortable
than
others.
Each
new
text
forced
me
to
don
a
different
hat
as
a
writer
and
channel
my
thoughts
and
conclusions
accordingly.
But
to
do
so,
I
first
had
to
figure
out
how
to
read
the
works
themselves,
to
glean
more
from
them
than
initially
met
the
eye.
So
it
seems
IOve
experienced
a
bit
more
literary
development
in
the
last
year
than
I
had
thought.
Overall,
I
think
my
time
as
a
WA
did
a
lot
to
inform
the
way
I
returned
to
writing
in
the
second
semester.
Working
as
a
WA
really
opened
my
eyes
to
the
fact
that
writing
is
a
mutual
growth
process
that
happens
when
you
share
ideas
and
knowledge
with
others.
I
learned
something
new
from
nearly
all
the
student
writers
I
saw,
and
I
hope
that
they
found
their
time
with
me
as
valuable.
Having
had
two
writing
intensive
classes
with
such
impact
on
the
way
I
write
and
think
about
the
writing
process
will
no
doubt
influence
the
way
I
approach
my
writing
conferences
in
the
fall.
Without
a
doubt,
I
will
start
discussions
with
questions
about
the
texts,
as
I
have
a
newfound
appreciation
for
their
importance.
As
far
as
advice
to
new
WAs
goes,
IOm
not
sure
that
I
have
any
truly
profound
nuggets
to
offer.
The
best
I
can
do
is
hope
that
hearing
about
my
experiences,
and
reading
my
less
than
perfectly
organized
paper,
inspires
some
confidence
and
ideas
about
how
to
hold
a
successful
discussion
about
the
writing
process.
