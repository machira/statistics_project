My
First
Year
as
a
Writing
Associate
Allowing
oneOs
personal
aspirations
to
fall
victim
to
lifeOs
hardships
may
be
a
desirable
solution,
but
also
a
costly
sacrifice.
It
takes
great
perseverance,
drive,
and
passion
to
rise
above
difficulties
and
long-term
goals.
My
goal
is
simple:
academic
enrichment
through
the
use
of
my
knowledge
to
help
those
in
need
of
a
helping
hand.
My
writing
experience
as
a
Writing
Associae
(WA)
has
helped
me
to
appreciate
the
value
of
this
goal,
and
I
look
forward
to
continue
reaching
it
with
the
program
this
year.
In
fall
of
2007,
I
transferred
from
St.
MaryOs
College
of
CA
in
the
East
Bay
of
San
Francisco
to
Lafayette
College.
I
was
ripe.
After
two
semesters
of
a
successful
academic
career,
I
felt
ready
to
conquer
and
to
topple
Nthe
Lafayette
MountainO.
Upon
beginning
the
fall
semester
of
my
sophomore
year,
I
attended
a
panel
geared
towards
newly
admitted
Psychology
Majors.
I
remember
the
emphasis
put
on
acquiring
skills
that
transfer
from
discipline
to
discipline
D
the
cornerstone
of
a
liberal
arts
education.
Both
professors
and
alumni
alike
encouraged
campus
involvement
from
a
variety
of
perspectives.
I
agreed
-
in
order
to
truly
finish
my
undergraduate
career,
I
knew
I
wanted
to
be
involved
in
varying
facets
of
the
campus
community.
I
barely
knew
my
classmates
yet,
and
I
had
more
free
time
after
classes
than
I
would
prefer
to
admit.
I
immediately
joined
a
sorority,
took
a
directing
position
in
the
house,
and
resided
on
the
Residence
Hall
Council.
Although
the
sorority
maintained
a
consistent
bond
of
friendships
and
study
buddies,
I
knew
I
wanted
to
continue
my
personal
development
in
the
academic
realm
outside
the
classroom.
Lafayette
has
a
variety
of
lab
assistants,
mentors,
and
tutors;
I
knew
one
of
these
positions
would
be
a
wonderful
opportunity.
In
my
spring
semester,
I
took
a
VAST
course
with
an
assigned
Writing
Associate.
After
experiencing
the
benefits
of
a
trained
eye
reviewing
my
drafts,
I
asked
Danielle
about
the
WA
program.
She
explained
her
involvement
in
the
association
and
attested
to
her
accomplishment
in
assisting
students
with
tough
written
prose.
She
encouraged
me
to
apply
for
the
position.
Soon
after,
I
started
attending
Drop-in
sessions
when
I
had
papers
due
to
experience
more
with
what
the
program
was
able
to
offer.
When
the
time
came
to
apply
for
WA
positions,
I
decided
to
follow
in
my
friendOs
footsteps
and
try
the
program.
As
I
filled
out
the
application
and
re-read
my
example
paper
for
the
admission
requirements,
I
was
racked
with
ambivalence.
How
was
I
going
to
be
a
Writing
Associate
and
not
be
an
English
major?
Worst
possible
scenario
-
what
kind
of
help
could
I
provide
another
student
reading
obscure
text
in
an
upper-division
English
course?
I
didnOt
feel
prepared
to
take
on
some
potential
challenges
about
my
own
writing
let
alone
another
peer.
I
knew
I
would
have
to
go
the
extra
mile
to
brush
up
on
grammar
and
other
writing
basics
to
ensure
I
would
be
helpful
on
those
levels.
I
submitted
a
psychology
lab
report
as
my
writing
example
with
confidence
that
this
writing
was
an
excellent
example
of
my
ability
to
express
written
thought.
I
had
established
a
written
identity
different
from
many
of
the
writing
associates
with
a
scientific
background.
However,
I
didnOt
know
if
this
technique
and
new
identity
was
enough
for
the
esteemed
program.
Although
I
have
to
admit
that
those
fears
of
not
being
prepared
still
cross
my
mind
depending
on
my
placement,
I
know
that
the
writing
program
is
more
than
just
a
group
of
English
majors
correcting
younger
studentsO
work.
Upon
acceptance,
I
felt
a
rush
of
excitement
over
something
new
and
was
so
excited
to
continue
developing
my
skill
as
a
writer
and
peer
reviewer.
I
was
assigned
to
Professor
Worthen,
Dean
of
Students,
for
a
First
Year
Seminar
titled
NThe
American
College
StudentO.
The
unorthodox
seminar
text
and
open-ended
writing
topics
provided
me
with
ease
in
knowing
that
higher-order
concerns
in
writing
can
be
successfully
addressed
in
my
assigned
meetings.
My
initial
sessions
were
rocky
in
terms
of
over-preparing
for
a
discussion
only
to
find
a
complete
change
in
agenda
once
the
student
arrives.
In
addition,
it
took
me
a
while
to
build
the
self-confidence
needed
to
feel
comfortable
giving
other
students
suggestions
about
writing
topics
and
transitions.
I
didnOt
want
to
take
away
from
the
studentOs
voice.
However,
after
a
while
the
difficulty
subsided,
and
I
began
to
gauge
my
facilitative
role
for
what
it
was
-
a
peer
relationship,
without
the
classroom
hierarchy
or
the
authoritarian
professor
scrutinizing
every
grammatical
oversight
with
a
sharp
red
pen.
I
was
just
another
helpful
ear,
just
as
Danielle
had
described.
I
would
come
to
each
meeting
with
a
few
major
suggestions
and
points
to
cover,
but
also
acknowledge
that
everything
I
want
to
discuss
in
the
meeting
would
not
be
according
to
my
agenda.
The
studentOs
needs
are
my
main
priority.
My
second
placement
was
with
my
original
VAST
course
taught
by
Dr.
Waters
in
the
biology
department.
I
was
so
excited
to
work
with
this
professor
again,
only
to
remember
my
20-page
research
paper
at
the
end
of
the
term.
Now
I
have
fifteen
or
more
20-page
papers
to
read!
Even
with
these
long
research
papers
on
my
agenda,
I
will
happily
admit
that
this
placement
was
in
my
comfort
zone
with
scientific
writing.
While
trucking
through
the
variety
of
difficult
topics
in
this
NEthics
in
the
Pharmaceutical
IndustryO
course,
I
was
confronted
ironically
with
my
most
difficult
ethical
decision
to
date.
One
of
the
students
had
submitted
a
NWA
ready
draftO
consisting
of
multiple
excerpts
from
online
websites
with
few
word
or
sentence
changes.
No
citations
present.
I
spoke
to
the
Professor
about
potential
plans
of
action
to
discuss
this
problem
with
the
student.
We
agreed
that
I
would
remind
the
student
repeatedly
about
the
appropriate
method
of
citation,
and
then
I
should
see
the
progress
with
the
next
WA
ready
draft.
I
confronted
the
student
at
the
meeting
calmly
so
the
student
knew
I
was
only
trying
to
better
his
or
her
writing;
however,
I
made
it
clear
that
this
behavior
is
considered
plagarism
and
needs
to
come
to
an
end
for
academic
and
moral
sake.
The
student
responded
with,
Nthe
paper
is
only
a
draft,
and
I
was
planning
on
adding
the
citations.O
I
gave
the
student
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
hoped
he
or
she
understood
the
gravity
of
the
situation,
regardless
of
the
seriousness
of
the
draft.
From
my
perspective
as
a
WA,
the
student
submitted
this
paper
to
a
peer
reader
with
the
intention
that
this
paper
was
his
or
her
own
words.
Unfortunately,
the
same
behavior
was
presented
again
on
an
alternative
movie
response
paper
a
month
later.
I
was
floored.
I
knew
that
if
the
Professor
received
this
draft,
then
the
student
would
not
be
allowed
to
pass
the
VAST
course.
On
the
other
hand,
I
had
searched
an
oddly
phrased
paragraph
on
Google
for
this
particular
studentOs
paper
when
I
had
not
searched
for
other
peers.
Is
it
fair
or
just
to
only
Google
one
peerOs
paper
because
that
student
had
plagiarized
earlier
in
the
course?
After
thoughtful
consideration,
I
presented
the
evidence
to
the
partner
Professor,
and
the
situation
was
handled
accordingly.
Only
during
those
moments
do
I
fully
comprehend
my
role
in
this
program
as
more
than
Njust
another
helpful
ear.O
I
have
come
to
terms
with
the
fact
that
this
studentOs
outcome
occurred
because
of
his
or
her
own
actions,
but
part
of
me
still
feels
torn
by
my
involvement
as
more
than
a
peer
editor.
Dr.
Waters
was
very
thankful
that
I
had
the
ability
to
come
forward
with
this
difficult
information,
and
I
do
not
regret
the
tough
decision.
At
the
end
of
the
year,
I
found
it
interesting
that
my
most
difficult
challenges
did
not
come
from
actual
writing
or
peer
editing,
but
from
the
implications
of
writing.
I
struggled
the
most
with
taking
the
ProfessorOs
requirements,
the
studentOs
needs,
and
my
agenda
and
personal
growth
into
account
when
making
some
of
these
complicated
decisions.
Regardless,
from
my
WA
experience
IOve
learned
that
Lafayette
students
are
heterogeneous
and
come
from
very
different
backgrounds.
As
such,
sometimes
all
a
student
really
needs
is
the
reassurance
that
they
are
doing
satisfactory
written
work.
Other
times,
students
require
specific
writing
assistance
ranging
from
performing
close
reading
to
assisting
unfinished
conclusions.
In
either
case,
I
attempted
to
structure
WA
sessions
based
on
an
individualOs
immediate
need
while
addressing
potential
long-term
writing
goals.
I
tell
anyone
who
needs
writing
assistance
inside
or
outside
the
classroom
to
visit
the
WA
room
and
become
familiar
with
its
resources.
After
all,
Lafayette
students
and
parents
are
paying
for
it,
and
we
know
by
now
that
education
is
expensive.
My
experience
as
a
WA
has
underscored
much
of
my
academic
success
at
Lafayette
College
so
far.
Not
only
have
I
assisted
others
in
his
or
her
writing
progress
in
terms
of
grammar
and
content,
but
also
have
learned
strategies
and
lessons
from
the
Writing
Associate
program
that
are
sometimes
overlooked
in
the
classroom.
Through
my
peer
meetings
and
staff
meetings,
several
seemingly
small
guidelines
have
made
me
a
more
thorough
reader
and
writer.
I
want
to
share
three
suggestions
to
the
new
Writing
Associates.
First,
students
should
give
themselves
plenty
of
time
to
write
a
paper.
Many
times,
students
only
take
a
day
or
two
to
write
an
essay.
As
a
rule
of
thumb,
I
generally
give
myself
two
weeks
to
write
a
five-page
paper.
Of
course
this
is
not
always
possible.
In
those
cases
give
yourself
as
much
time
as
you
can.
And
remember:
you
can
always
revise
drafts.
But
if
you
donOt
go
through
several
drafts,
youOll
find
yourself
revising
underdeveloped
ideas.
Although
the
writing
associate
program
requires
we
meet
with
each
student
four
times
during
the
semester,
the
WA
and
professor
decide
when
these
meetings
take
place.
I
always
try
to
meet
with
my
students
at
least
one
and
a
half
weeks
before
the
paper
is
due.
This
timeline
forces
students
to
at
least
come
up
with
a
brief
paper
outline,
which
can
usually
result
in
a
constructive
meeting
by
developing
a
thesis
and
by
developing
the
paragraph
transitions.
Next,
writing
is
not
instantaneous,
nor
do
students
tend
to
become
a
good
writer
overnight;
it
is
part
of
a
larger
process
of
self-growth
that
takes
practice.
Every
student
is
unique
and
has
had
different
preparation
and
quality
of
education.
So,
if
you
experience
anything
like
I
did,
try
not
to
compare
yourself
to
peers
and
classmates.
You
need
to
find
where
you
are
and
what
techniques
work
for
you,
and
then
work
from
there.
Oftentimes,
students
just
need
help
developing
an
idea
that
hasnOt
instantly
come
to
them
upon
receiving
an
assignment.
Only
until
the
student
knows
his
or
her
personal
writing
development
and
the
WA
knows
how
to
adapt
according
to
the
needs
of
varying
peers
can
this
personal
growth
begin.
WAs
need
to
be
sensitive
to
these
differences
and
have
multiple
tools
to
address
studentOs
difficulties.
Finally,
students
shouldnOt
be
afraid
to
seek
out
advice
outside
of
the
WA
program
or
WA
meetings.
The
program
has
a
drop-in
service
in
place
for
these
important
instances.
In
addition,
WAs
need
to
be
available
to
students
if
extra
help
is
needed
as
long
as
time
is
respected.
IOve
told
the
students,
Nthe
more
eyes
that
see
your
essay
(or
hear
your
ideas),
the
more
likely
you
will
be
able
to
identify
problem
areas,
thus
increasing
your
chances
of
getting
that
choice
grade
and
making
writing
progress.O
Overall,
all
of
these
ideas
are
intertwined.
After
a
year
of
WA
program
participation,
I
realized
how
wide
these
transferrable
writing
skills
extend.
I
used
these
time
management
and
diligent
skills
in
all
my
Lafayette
courses
and
IOm
sure
I
will
continue
beyond
my
undergraduate
career.
WAs
do
not
need
to
be
experts
in
grammar
and
writing
technique
to
have
a
thoughtful
and
facilitative
opinion
about
a
peerOs
draft.
There
are
going
to
be
difficult
moral
decisions
regarding
our
roles
in
the
program
if
challenged
by
our
peers,
but
the
outcome
is
worth
the
struggle.
My
goal
to
achieve
academic
enrichment
through
my
knowledge
to
help
those
in
need
has
been
an
interesting
role
travelled.
My
organization
and
time
management
are
tested
everyday;
however,
the
self-growth
is
beyond
what
I
expected.
