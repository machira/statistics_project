Program
I
cannot
recall
the
first
time
I
picked
up
a
pencil
or
scribbled
down
my
first
letters,
as
I
am
sure
most
individuals
cannot.
Looking
back,
writing
always
seemed
to
be
a
constant
in
my
life,
with
no
beginning
and
no
visible
end.
At
times,
writing
appeared
to
be
an
ability
that
I
was
inherently
given.
Although
I
do
not
remember
the
first
time
I
ever
wrote
words
down
on
paper,
I
do
remember
key
moments
from
my
personal
writing
history,
from
its
humble
beginning
in
kindergarten
to
its
current
unfolding
at
Lafayette
College.
My
writing
story
is
like
most
others,
is
composed
of
highs
and
lows,
successes
and
failures,
joys
and
frustrations.
It
is
a
story
that
will
not
stop
after
college
or
after
law
school
(hopefully!),
but
will
continue
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
My
first
significant
piece
of
NwritingO
that
I
can
recall
was
in
Mrs.
LabargeOs
kindergarten
class.
Each
student
had
a
composition
notebook
that
served
as
their
writing
journal,
and
the
teacher
allowed
time
everyday
for
students
to
sit
down
and
scribble
down
whatever
they
wanted
in
their
journals.
I
can
still
picture
my
writing
journal.
It
was
an
obnoxious
Caribbean
blue,
and
was
sophisticatedly
decorated
with
glittery
Lisa
FrankS
tiger
and
pony
stickers.
Adorning
the
front
cover
was
my
name,
carefully
written
in
the
large,
perfect
typewriter
print
that
all
elementary
school
teachers
seem
to
possess.
In
my
young
mind,
it
was
the
prettiest
journal
Neva.O
Inside
my
journal
were
all
of
my
five-year
old
selfOs
deepest
thoughts.
There
were
stick
figure
drawings
of
my
family,
as
well
as
pictures
of
cats
and
flowers.
Each
picture
had
a
NmeticulouslyO
written
label
to
help
the
viewer
grasp
what
I
intended
for
my
drawing
to
depict.
At
the
bottom
of
each
page
was
a
simple
sentence
along
the
lines
of,
NI
love
my
family,O
and
NI
love
cats.O
These
small
compositions
were
practically
chiseled
into
the
paper
with
my
fat
blue
pencil,
my
letters
in
all
different
sizes,
and
my
sentences
seemed
to
slant
at
a
45A
angle.
While
these
small
sentences
were
far
from
perfect,
they
provided
me
with
my
first
taste
of
writing,
and
in
a
sense,
introduced
me
to
the
world
of
academic
writing
that
fully
engrosses
me
today.
After
my
kindergarten
journal,
my
writing
memory
jumps
to
2001,
and
skips
over
my
entire
elementary
school
career.
It
was
February,
and
in
honor
of
Black
History
Month,
my
sixth
grade
teacher
assigned
the
class
an
essay
about
the
legacy
of
Martin
Luther
King
Jr.
The
essay
had
to
be
at
least
three
pages
in
length,
and
was
one
of
the
first
extensive
essays
ever
assigned
to
me.
I
did
plenty
of
research
for
my
essay:
I
read
encyclopedia
biographies,
scanned
articles
on
the
Internet,
and
watched
the
famous
NI
Have
a
DreamO
speech.
After
my
initial
research,
I
sat
down
at
the
computer
and
churned
out,
what
I
believed
to
be,
a
stunning
piece
of
academic
prose.
Upon
my
paperOs
completion,
I
asked
my
mother
to
read
over
my
work
and
checked
it
for
spelling
and
grammatical
errors.
Despite
the
fact
that
I
practically
believed
I
was
a
writing
prodigy,
I
had
not
developed
confidence
in
my
editing
abilities
yet.
When
my
mom
returned
my
paper,
pencil
marks
and
corrections
decorated
all
the
white
spaces
on
the
page.
My
mother
informed
me
that
not
only
was
my
paper
riddled
with
grammatical
errors,
but
it
had
little
flow
due
to
my
lack
of
Ntransition
sentences.O
Of
course,
this
criticism
was
not
the
response
I
wanted
to
hear
from
her.
I
wanted
my
mommy
to
tell
me
that
I
was
a
genius,
and
that
mine
was
the
best
paper
she
had
ever
laid
eyes
on.
After
my
mother
finished
listing
out
her
laundry
list
of
critiques,
I
yelled
and
cried,
informing
her
that
my
paper
was
perfect,
and
therefore,
I
refused
to
fix
it.
I
eventually
calmed
down,
and
when
I
did,
my
mother
offered
to
sit
down
with
me
and
teach
me
how
to
write
good
transition
sentences
that
would
tie
my
paragraphs
together.
The
lesson
seemed,
at
least
to
my
11-year
old-self,
to
take
fifteen
hours
of
hellish
sentence
revision
and
reconstruction.
Finally,
with
my
motherOs
help,
I
completed
my
paperOs
revision,
and
I
was
more
than
happy
to
turn
it
in
and
never
look
at
it
again.
I
was
certainly
not
expecting,
or
willing
for
that
matter,
to
reexamine
my
Martin
Luther
King
Jr.
paper
only
a
week
after
my
trying
experience
in
my
motherOs
editing
boot
camp.
However,
just
seven
short
days
after
I
submitted
my
paper,
my
teacher
pulled
me
aside
and
asked
me
if
we
could
discuss
my
paper.
Instantly,
my
mind
began
racing
with
thoughts
like,
NOH
NO,
I
am
not
looking
at
that
again,O
and
NGod,
what
could
possibly
be
wrong
with
it
now!O
To
my
surprise,
and
relief,
he
asked
if
he
could
photocopy
my
paper
and
hand
it
out
to
the
class
as
an
example
of
a
stellar
paper.
I
was
so
happy!
I
was
beaming
with
pride
for
the
rest
of
the
day,
and
I
could
not
wait
to
get
home
and
tell
my
mom
the
good
news.
Of
course
she
told
me
how
proud
she
was
of
me,
and
I
suspect
was
simultaneously
thinking
to
herself,
NYup.
Yet
another
example
of
how
mom
is
always
right.O
My
Martin
Luther
King
Jr.
paper
and
my
motherOs
subsequent
writing
lesson
also
provided
me
with
lasting
benefits
that
continue
to
this
day.
I
continue
to
follow
the
rules
that
NMommyO
set
out
for
me
when
I
write
my
papers.
I
look
back
at
my
paragraphs
and
ask
myself,
NDo
these
paragraphs
flow
well?
Do
these
ideas
carry
over
into
following
paragraphs?O
Asking
myself
these
questions
helped
me
write
much
stronger
papers
in
all
of
my
courses,
including
those
in
college.
Of
course
taking
the
time
to
evaluate
my
work
so
closely
adds
hours
to
the
time
I
take
to
edit
and
review
my
papers,
but
I
know
that
this
is
time
well
spent
because
it
ensures
that
I
produce
a
much
higher
quality
of
work.
After
the
Martin
Luther
King
Jr.
paper,
my
writing
history
rockets
ahead
a
few
years
and
lands
in
2005.
At
this
time,
I
was
in
the
tenth
grade,
and
beginning
my
first
year
of
Honors
English.
The
classO
first
major
assignment
was
a
critical
lens
on
the
autobiography
Black
Boy.
From
the
moment
I
read
the
assignment,
I
knew
this
essay
would
not
be
simple
task.
Not
only
did
I
not
understand
the
prompt,
but
I
also
couldnOt
fathom
how
Black
Boy
applied
to
the
task
presented
to
us.
However,
because
I
was
15,
a
teenager,
and
stubborn,
I
refused
to
spend
any
extended
period
of
time
concentrating
on
understanding
my
essay,
or
asking
my
teacher
for
assistance.
Needless
to
say,
I
waited
until
the
night
before
the
five
page
essay
was
due
to
even
start
putting
coherent
sentences
down
on
paper.
I
finally
began
composing
my
piece
at
about
five
oOclock
in
the
evening,
and
finally
finished
at
ten.
The
only
problem
was
that
I
knew
my
paper
needed
a
great
deal
of
editing
because
I
just
threw
down
any
random
assortment
of
ideas
that
popped
into
my
head
in
order
to
fill
blank
space.
Once
again,
Mom
came
to
my
rescue
and
offered
to
help
me
edit
after
I
told
her
my
plight.
So,
the
two
of
us
sat
down
at
the
kitchen
table
with
my
paper
and
cups
of
tea,
and
hoped
that
we
would
be
in
bed
before
the
sun
started
to
rise.
As
I
had
expected,
my
mother
found
multiple
errors
and
entire
paragraphs
in
desperate
need
of
improvement.
My
mom
tried
to
help
as
best
she
could,
but
there
was
only
so
much
she
could
do
because
the
core
themes
and
ideas
of
the
paper
are
flawed.
All
too
aware
that
my
time
had
run
out,
all
I
could
do
was
make
the
changes
Mom
suggested,
and
go
to
sleep.
As
I
handed
in
my
horrendous
Black
Boy
paper
in
the
next
day,
I
knew
that
I
would
not
receive
the
NAO
I
was
used
to.
I
realized
that
I
did
not
deserve
a
high
grade,
and
even
my
mother
had
warned
me
the
night
before
not
to
expect
my
usual
marks
because
this
paper
was
not
the
usual
high
quality
that
I
produced.
Even
though
my
mom
was
only
restating
what
I
already
knew
myself,
her
words
really
upset
me.
Hearing
someone
else
point
out
my
failure
caused
me
great
embarrassment.
Needless
to
say,
my
teacher
agreed
with
my
mother,
and
gave
me
a
NB+O
on
the
paper.
I
actually
thought
that
this
grade
was
rather
generous
of
her,
considering
my
paper
lacked
a
strong
argument,
failed
to
display
a
firm
understanding
of
the
task,
required
tighter
transitional
flow.
After
I
got
my
paper
back,
I
was
so
angry
with
myself
for
not
putting
in
the
effort
necessary
to
produce
a
praise-worthy
essay
worthy
of
the
NAO
I
desired.
Even
though
I
did
not
earn
the
grade
I
desired,
I
learned
a
great
deal
from
the
Black
Boy
critical
lens.
Since
that
fateful
assignment,
if
I
do
not
understand
an
assignment
or
I
am
unclear
on
any
portion
of
a
paper,
I
ask
for
assistance
right
away.
This
paper
made
me
realize
that
taking
a
half-hour
of
my
day
to
ask
for
clarification
helps
me
avoid
the
hours
of
anxiety
and
stress
that
I
experience
when
I
try
and
figure
out
all
the
solutions
myself,
and
it
helps
me
compose
a
much
stronger
piece.
In
addition,
I
no
longer
put
off
writing
papers
until
the
night
before
the
due
date.
While
I
still
write
entire
papers
in
one
sitting
because
I
am
not
the
type
of
writer
that
can
write
one
or
two
pages
at
a
time
and
come
back
to
it.
However,
I
now
leave
at
least
two
days
for
the
review
and
revision
of
my
work.
Taking
so
much
time
for
review
helps
me
ensure
that
the
core
arguments
of
my
paper
are
well
developed
and
supported,
and
that
I
have
effectively
communicated
my
ideas
in
a
clear
and
concise
manner.
I
learned
these
lessons
by
accepting
my
mistakes
and
growing
from
them,
rather
than
dwelling
on
them,
thus
allowing
me
to
become
a
much
more
confident
and
effecting
writer.
One
of
my
favorite
writing
memories
came
just
one
year
after
my
infamous
Black
Boy
essay,
in
my
junior
year
Honors
English
class.
Instead
of
having
an
in
class
final
exam,
my
teacher
required
students
to
compose
an
author
analysis
essay.
This
paper
called
for
students
to
read
at
least
two
novels
by
an
approved
author,
and
identify
themes
and
writing
styles
that
transcend
all
of
the
authorOs
works.
My
chosen
author
was
Tracy
Chevalier,
who
is
best
known
for
her
bestselling
novel
The
Girl
with
the
Pearl
Earring.
I
became
quickly
engrossed
in
the
project
because
I
fell
in
love
with
my
authorOs
novels`.
I
spent
most
of
my
free
time
pouring
over
the
three
novels
I
had
chosen
to
include
in
my
essay:
The
Girl
with
the
Pearl
Earring,
The
Lady
and
the
Unicorn,
and
Fallen
Angels.
I
covered
the
pages
of
these
novels
with
underlines
and
Post-it
Notes
S,
marking
any
sentence
that
I
thought
would
bring
me
one
step
closer
to
developing
my
thesis.
After
reading
my
first
novel,
The
Girl
with
the
Pearl
Earring,
I
had
a
few
scattered
ideas
of
what
my
proposed
thesis
could
be,
but
I
had
no
concrete
theme
to
construct
an
academic
analysis
around.
However,
after
reading
ChevalierOs
second
novel,
The
Lady
and
the
Unicorn,
the
underlying
theme
across
both
novels
jumped
out
at
me
with
astonishing
clarity:
societyOs
subjugation
and
oppression
of
women,
regardless
of
class,
throughout
history.
Armed
with
my
ingenious
thesis,
I
sat
in
my
bed
for
hoursNmy
theory
is
that
if
youOre
going
to
be
sitting
for
so
long
you
had
mind
as
well
be
comfortableNand
wrote
the
entire
first
draft
of
my
lengthy
seventeen-page
analysis.
About
a
week
after
I
turned
my
preliminary
draft
into
my
teacher,
I
had
a
private
meeting
with
him
to
discuss
the
content
and
progress
of
my
work,
and
whether
or
not
he
felt
my
analysis
was
moving
in
a
positive
direction.
Of
course
I
was
nervous
about
what
my
teacher
would
say
about
my
paper.
Even
though
I
thought
I
wrote
a
strong
and
compelling
paper,
I
knew
that
there
was
a
chance
that
he
could
feel
completely
differently
about
my
work.
At
the
start
of
the
conference,
he
pulled
out
my
paper
and
sat
quietly
for
a
moment.
This
prolonged
silence
made
my
stomach
flutter
and
my
jaw
to
chatter
audibly
with
nerves.
Finally,
he
looked
at
me
and
said,
NI
have
not
read
a
first
draft
this
strong
in
years.
You
did
an
incredible
job.O
I
was
ecstatic
for
two
reasons:
one,
my
teacher
truly
enjoyed
my
work,
and
two,
the
true
teenager
inside
me
was
thrilled
that
I
would
not
have
to
do
much
revision
over
the
weekend.
That
weekend,
I
made
the
few
grammatical
and
syntax
corrections
that
my
teacher
had
suggested,
and
that
following
Monday,
I
confidently
submitted
my
final
draft
in
a
manila
envelop
with
my
name
stamped
across
the
front.
Weeks
past,
and
truth
be
told,
I
somewhat
forgot
about
my
author
analysis
because
of
the
SATs,
ACTs,
finals,
AP
and
regents
exams,
and
college
visits.
Then
one
day,
our
teacher
announced
that
he
would
be
returning
out
research
papers.
I
instantly
froze
with
anticipation
and
nervousness.
I
knew
that
he
had
liked
my
first
draft,
but
for
some
reason,
I
was
still
nervous
about
my
final
grade.
With
my
last
name
beginning
with
a
NW,O
I
knew
I
would
be
the
last
person
in
the
class
to
get
their
paper
back,
and
would
therefore
be
subjected
to
at
least
five
minutes
of
anxious
agony
as
I
watched
all
my
peers
receive
their
final
grades.
At
last,
my
teacher
placed
the
manila
folder
on
my
desk,
and
I
tore
into
it
in
a
fury.
I
ripped
out
the
paper,
and
across
the
top
in
large
red
letters
a
note
read,
N97.
A
masterwork.O
I
was
on
cloud
nine
after
such
praise
because
for
the
first
time,
I
received
praise
for
a
paper
that
I
felt
was
entirely
mine:
the
ideas
were
not
prompted
by
my
teacher,
and
the
thesis
was
not
generic.
Looking
back,
I
truly
feel
that
it
was
at
this
point
that
I
really
came
into
my
own
as
an
academic
writer,
and
realized
my
strength
for
analytical
writing.
From
here,
my
memorable
writing
history
lapses
again,
and
begins
again
in
my
freshman
year
at
Lafayette.
I
have
no
specific
writing
assignment
from
this
past
year
that
truly
stands
out
in
my
memory
yet,
probably
because
they
are
so
recent
and
it
is
too
early
to
see
how
they
have
helped
me
grow
as
a
writer.
That
does
not
mean
that
I
did
not
write
a
lot
in
the
past
year.
In
fact,
I
wrote
constantly
for
all
my
courses,
from
my
FYS,
to
my
International
Politics
class,
to
my
Food
Histories
course.
I
usually
had
about
one
paper
a
week
to
write,
from
short
two-page
reading
responses
to
long
twenty-page
take-home
exams.
What
I
have
found
is
that
high
school
prepared
me
extremely
well
for
the
world
of
college
academic
writing,
even
though
the
caliber
of
writing
expected
at
college
is
higher
than
that
required
in
my
high
school
courses.
I
have
been
able
to
apply
everything
that
I
had
learned
from
my
years
of
academic
writing
in
high
school
to
my
college
assignments
because
the
core
principles
of
writing
that
I
learned
held
true:
plan
your
ideas
well
in
advance,
make
sure
you
have
all
questions
clarified,
and
review
and
revise
your
work.
Of
course,
now
that
I
am
in
college,
each
step
is
much
more
extensive
and
requires
a
great
deal
more
time.
However,
spending
this
addition
time
on
my
writing
has
truly
helped
me
perfect
the
skills
necessary
to
be
an
effective
academic
writer.
The
largest
difference
in
my
writing
process
that
developed
in
college
is
that
I
spend
much
more
time
revising
my
papers.
Due
to
this
constant
revision,
my
writing
has
vastly
improved
in
the
past
year.
I
am
able
to
concisely
express
my
ideas,
which
was
always
a
problem
for
me
before.
In
high
school
and
the
beginning
of
my
freshman
year
at
Lafayette,
I
would
have
to
use
0.2
margins
on
papers
so
that
I
would
not
exceed
the
assigned
page
count.
Now,
I
can
convey
all
of
my
ideas
within
assigned
page
limits
using
standard
one-inch
marginsNa
small
feat
to
some,
but
a
huge
one
for
me.
In
addition
to
helping
me
become
more
concise,
continuous
review
of
my
work
has
improved
my
writing
processes
and
skills
in
many
other
ways.
First,
revision
has
allowed
me
to
write
without
using
the
passive
voice,
allowing
my
papers
to
sound
more
eloquent
and
logical.
In
addition,
I
now
know
the
benefits
of
constructing
a
formal
outline
because
it
allows
you
to
thoroughly
plan
out
and
organize
your
ideas
before
you
sit
down
to
write,
making
the
actual
writing
process
so
much
simpler.
By
obtaining
and
honing
these
skills,
my
writing
has
improved
tremendously,
and
the
process
of
completing
papers
is
no
longer
a
source
of
anxiety.
I
can
confidently
say
that
college
has
polished
the
skills
that
I
began
to
develop
in
high
school,
and
has
made
me
the
strong
academic
writer
that
I
am
today
by
providing
me
with
the
guidance
and
practice
needed
for
improvement.
From
my
first
kindergarten
journal
to
my
collegiate
research
papers,
my
personal
writing
history
has
been
a
long
journey.
As
with
any
adventure,
mine
has
been
full
of
challenges,
failures,
and
triumphs.
I
know
that
my
story
does
not
end
at
Lafayette
College
or
graduate
school,
and
that
it
will
continue
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
I
donOt
know
where
life
will
take
me,
but
I
know
that
writing
will
be
a
constant,
and
will
continue
to
influence
my
daily
activities.
I
am
looking
forward
to
taking
on
my
next
writing
challenges,
including
my
new
tasks
as
a
Writing
Associate,
and
adding
to
my
writing
story
that
began
nearly
fifteen
years
ago.
I
know
there
will
be
challenges
and
discouragements
in
my
writing
future,
but
I
know
that
these
difficult
moments
provide
me
with
the
learning
experiences
that
will
help
shape
my
writing
and
change
it
for
the
better.
I
am
waiting
to
welcome
the
next
writing
task
that
comes
my
way
with
open
arms
and
an
eager
mind
because
I
know
that
I
am
have
never
been
so
ready
and
fully
prepared
to
tackle
the
challenge
with
everything
IOve
got.
