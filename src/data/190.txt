whether

the

I
enrolled
in

the

that
taught

or.
for

something
completely
unseen
in
me.
T
became
completely

in

the

were

boring
I

I

Unfortunately,
it
was
still

There
is
of

an
enormous
and
contrary
side
to
this
upsetting
experience
Regardless
of
how
my
own
writing
temporarily
suffered,
being
a
writing
associate
was
something
T
would
never
have
changed
nor
can
I
regret
Tn
fact
if
I
had
not

all

and
weakly

to

unenlightened
by

First
and

being
a
writing
associate
has
greatly
improved

The

pushed

to

and.
more
importantly,
it
finally
forced

to
make

changes
Also,
the
iob
reauired
me
to
understand
and
encourage
the
need
for
multiple
drafts
in
completing
a
written
draft
I
was
always
the
tvoe
of
student
to
throw
together
the
one
and
only
draft
about
an

before

Sitting
in

at

with

no

and

to

difficulties
I
must
in

apply
my
advice
to
mvself
When
F
finally
came
to
terms
with
mvself
and
mv
shortcomings.
T
realized
that
I
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
of
multiple
drafts
Multiple
drafts,
as
T
eventually
admitted,
is
in
fact
an
asset
of
good
writing
and
reflects
characteristics
of
a
good
writer
Unfortunately
not
all
of
mv
experiences
as
a
writing
associate
were
rewarding
or
perhaps
even
helpful
I
would
commonly
receive
drafts
of
noor
duality
and
knowing
completely
that
the
problem
stemmed
from
a
lack
of
effort
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
ability,
mv
frustration
brewed
I
often
felt
after
hours
of
trying
to
pick
apart
the
sloppy
piecemeal
papers
and
racking
mv
brain
in
attempt
to
uncover
the
writer's
meaning
and
ideas,
that
T
was
wasting
mv
time
and
energy
Student

student
would
arrive
late
and
unprepared
with
an
unappreciative
attitude
such
that
I
was
twisting
their
arm
and
forcing
them
to
be
in
mv
presence
That
is
not
even
considering
the
students
who
failed
to

up
at
all.

I
must
admit
it
was
often
auite
hard
to
refrain
from
lashing
out
in
bordering
anger
or
stop
mvself
from
totally
giving
up
on
every
student
in
the
class
and
canceling
all
future
meetings
However.
I
found
the
strength
and
energy
to
continue
in
mv
auest
of
assistance
and
developed
a
hard
outer
shell
to
those
forced
feelings
of
worthlessness
and
uselessness.
Like
all

there
is
bad
and
in
this
case,
like
all
bad
there

I
strongly
believe
that
mv
ability
to
communicate
mv

has
largely
improved
as
a
result
of
mv
position
as
a
writing
associate
T
was
always
a
passionately
opinionated
and
sometimes
stubborn
individual,
but
often
1
would
find
mvself
trapped
within
mv
own
chosen
language
and
even
more
commonly
T
would
be
at
a
loss
for
words
simply
because,
vocally.
I
could
not
describe
the
thoughts
that
iumped
around
my
mind
Usuallv
I
had
no
difficulty
at
all
in
communicating
through
writing
because
the
task
allowed
me
time
to
think
and
room
to
manipulate
and
correct
mv
words
Still,
again
and
again,
when
it
came
to

with
the
fear
of

T

to

and

thoroughly

about

T
chose
to

With
practice
T
soon
noticed
mvself

and

Basically,
I
figured
out
how
best
to
help
the
student
bv
working
with
their
own
ideas
and
expansions
The
position
of

associate
came
with
great
responsibility
and

a

writer,
but
during
the
first
few
meetings
T
had
to
force
mvself
to
correct
the
students
faulty
ideas
and
guide
them
in
the
right
direction
As
a
sophomore
T
was
basically
the
same
aae
as
the
students
in
mv
assigned
class
which
created
a
small
conflict
I
did
not
feel
that
T
had
the
authority
to
tell
another
student
how
to
improve
their
paper.
And
F
will
admit
that
there
were
a
few
students
who
T
truly
had
little
to
no
advice
for
simply
because
those
students
wrote
with
a
t
least
mv
same
ability.
Tn
cases
such
as
these
T
usually
attempted
to
let
the
student
run

would

Often
the
best
advice
and
possible
help
to
give
these
students
is
to
simply
talk
about
the
paper.
The
students
usually
discover
for
themselves
where
their

exist
and
iust
talking
over
themes
and

In
an
overview,
being
a
writing
associate
has
greatly
molded
and
changed

of

and
my
ability
to

I
developed
much
