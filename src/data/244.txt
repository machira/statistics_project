^College
has
been
detrimental
to
my
writing
habits.
Through
the
last
year,
I
spent
most
of
my
hours
engulfed
in
menial
work
and
plagued
with
assignments
that
failed
to
spark
my
interest.
From
the
distant
past
and
slowly
fading
memories
I
can
recall
a
time
when
I
sat
up
at
night
painfully
discovering
and
frantically
documenting
a
chaos
of
thoughts
and
emotions.
Much
or
the
writing
is
fragmented
and
disoriented,
but
never
since
then
have
I
felt
so
compelled
to
write.
It
was
a
time
when
writing
engulfed
and
directed
my
existence.
But
now
I
lack
the
time
and
motivation.
I
am
left
somehow
empty,
and
no
matter
what
assignment
I
tackle,
it
does
nothing
to
cure
me,
but
perhaps
drained
me
further.
I
experienced
slight
but
tainted
release
my
first
semester
junior
year.
I
enrolled
in
Creative
Writing
in
an
attempt
to
revive
my
suffocating
imagination
and
rediscover
the
pleasure
of
writing.
However,
the
class,
though
more
fun
than
most,
was
a
quick,
strong
let
down.
My
writing
was
crushed
into
neatly
structured
categories
and
easily
identified
meanings.
I
did
not
want
to
be
assigned
a
topic
for
a
poem
or
a
story.
I
did
not
want
to
be
required
to
include
particulars.
But
most
of
all,
I
did
not
want
to
debate
the
meaning
with
or
receive
criticism
from
a
class
full
of
my
equals.
writing
wasn't
to
be
published
and
despite
the
idea
of
being
graded,
I
wanted
to
keep
it
as
my
ownTj
They
were
my
thoughts,
experiences
and
emotions
poured
over
the
lined
pages
and
I
could
hardly
excuse
myself
for
getting
attacked.
Day
after
day
I
sat
at
my
desk
with
the
regimented
assignment
before
me
wondering
why
creative
writing
was
so
restrictive.
And
why
it
was
that
nothing
I
wrote
could
be
charged
with
the
same
energy
that
fueled
my
previous
passion.
I
was
suffering
severely
from
a
mental
block
and
it
was
tearing
apart
my
every
notion
of
writing.
I
drudged
through
the
semester
placing
difficultly
summoned
words
on
paper
and
concocting
as
many
stories
as
possible.
I
had
traveled
a
complete
circle,
one
that
started
with
a
frenzy
of
possession
and
ended
in
mental
anguish.
I
continued
to
take
degenerative
steps
in
my
writing,
struggling
to
reclaim
the
initial
attraction
of
the
written
word.
The
semester
soon
ended,
but
my
condition
did
not
improve.
A
practice
I
once
held
very
dear
was
now
nothing
but
a
source
of
frustration
and
annoyance.
I
severed
my
attraction
to
writing
thinking
it
was
the
only
way
to
prevent
future
misery,
but
the
large
void
left
years
ago
grew
relentlessly.
I
could
no
longer
write
and
even
reading
became
a
chore.
Quietly
debating
the
change
I
had
not
welcomed,
my
mind
soon
grew
too
cloudy
to
think
properly
or
deeply.
The
weeks
passed
on,
and
I
tired
desperately
to
get
used
to
a
world
without
thought
or
words.
I
busied
myself
with
thousands
of
activities
and
finally
excuses
as
to
why.
Meanwhile,
second
semester
quickly
approached.
I
went
ito
it
with
a
grim
attitude,
but
when
summer
dawned,
I
had
rescued
a
tiny
piece
of
the
familiar
days.
I
was
presented
with
information
and
writing
and
concepts
so
foreign
that
I
was
required
to
think
and
reason.
Initially,
my
mind
revolted,
refusing
to
participate,
but
throughout
the
semester
it
grew
comfortable
and
easy.
My
mental
world
was
slowly
being
restored
and
I
reacted
with
enthusiasm.
Ideas
could
once
again
penetrate
my
shell
and
create
a
body
wide
tremor.
They
no
longer
fell
dead
at
the
openings
of
my
ears,
but
rather
creeped
inside
to
frighten,
comfort,
and
confuse.
I
was
pleased
to
say
the
least,
but
as
I
sat
down
to
write,
the
block
was
feverishly
reconstructed.
I
had
all
the
energy
racing
through
my
body,
but
nothing
would
drip
out
onto
paper.
I
was,
however,
making
some
progress
so
I
grew
more
relaxed
about
the
failed
writing.
At
least,
I
had
restored
portions
of
a
previously
wurowu
passion.
And
so
I
read.
I
read
constantly,
as
often
and
as
much
as
my
schedule
would
allow.
My
early
frenzies
of
writing
have
not
returned
and
a
small
hole
still
burns
it's
way
through
my
consciousness,
but
I
have
redirected
myself
merely
with
reading
and
it's
contemplation.
Slowly
the
mighty
flame
will
rekindle
and
I
will
rediscover
the
power
of
writing.
