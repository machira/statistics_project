WRITING
ASSOCIATE
WORKSHOP
PAPER
BY
JACQUELINE
HARRIS
I
guess
the
first
thing
I
ever
wrote
was
my
name.
I
used
to
get
a
lot
of
sympathy
from
my
classmates
because
my
name
has
ten
letters
in
it.
All
of
the
Toms,
Sues,
and
Jeffs
knew
they
really
had
it
easy.
I
overcame
the
challenge,
however,
and
was
extremely
excited
when
my
name,
complete
with
a
backwards
J
,
was
taped
to
the
front
of
our
refrigerator,
its
wide-lined
and
dotted
paper
taking
a
very
prominent
location
in
our
home.
This
was
a
day
filled
with
pride.
My
continued
role
as
an
elementary
writer
was
made
up
mostly
of
the
infamous
reports
,
so
frequently
assigned
to
the
young
student.
I
wrote
knowledgeably
on
subjects
such
as
Jupiter,
the
Panda
Bear,
Italy,
and
Zaire.
And,
although
I
always
received
respectable
marks
on
my
reports,
I
never
attributed
any
praise
a
direct
result
of
my
writing.
I
was
scared
to
rely
solely
on
my
writing
to
get
myself
an
A
.
Therefore,
all
of
my
reports
included
elaborate
covers,
pictures,
drawings,
and
in
one
case,
homemade
spaghetti
sauce.
At
this
point
in
my
life,
I
was
not
a
writer,
just
an
eager
student.
Emerging
from
this
sea
of
good
progress,
but
in
hindsight,
very
little
development,
is
my
fifth
grade
year.
I
was,
and
still
am,
a
horrendous
speller.
And,
although
I
was
able
to
pass
my
weekly
written
spelling
tests,
my
that
at
13
years
old,
when
nothing
made
sense
and
hormones
had
taken
away
any
chance
I
had
at
rationality,
I
was
able
to
express
my
self
through
my
writing.
Yes,
it
was
scary,
and
with
every
word
written
I
still
fear
failure,
but
the
high
that
comes
with
success
is
unsurmountable.
The
written
word
truly
is
a
power
that
continually
leaves
me
in
awe.
I
entered
high
school
knowing
that
no
matter
what,
I
was
good
at
something.
I
was
placed
in
honors
English,
one
of
two
sophomores
in
a
junior
and
senior
class,
and
BAM!
the
rude
awakening
I
received
left
me
sleepless
for
months.
I
was
no
longer
in
a
world
of
informative
reports
or
even
emotional
fiction.
I
was
suddenly
exposed
to
great,
complicated
works
of
literature
and
expected
to
evaluate
and
discuss
them
intelligently.
From
my
position,
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
anything
I
had
to
say
about
Shakespeare
or
Hawthorne
would
ever
be
intelligent.
In
desperation,
I
finally
approached
my
teacher
about
my
quality
of
writing.
He
then
gave
me
very
valuable
advice.
He
told
me
to
Practice,
develop
your
skills
like
an
athlete
or
a
musician.
You
can
never
be
great
at
something
occasional,
it
takes
repetition
to
develop
talent.
Basically,
he
told
me
to
keep
a
journal,
and
I
thought,
that's
it?,
the
great
words
of
wisdom
from
the
head
of
the
department
are
to
keep
a
diary?
Who
would
of
thought
that
the
old
man
was
right?
I
wasn't
completely
faithful
to
the
idea
of
a
journal,
but
in
increasing
the
youth
returned
with
every
jolly
good
I
received
in
praise
of
my
efforts.
When
you
asked
me
to
write
about
my
history
as
a
writer,
I
thought,
but
I'm
not
a
writer
.
Perhaps
I
always
figured
to
be
one
I'd
need
to
be
old
and
wrinkly,
maybe
starving,
most
definitely
wearing
a
beret
and
a
lot
of
bangle
bracelets,
and
that
brilliant
ideas
and
words
would
continually
flow
from
my
mouth.
In
thinking
back,
I
realize
that
I,
too,
am
a
writer,
even
though
I
often
just
wear
running
shoes
and
a
tee-shirt.
I
am
a
writer
because
I
do
share
something
with
my
fictional
image,
I
love
the
expression.
I
need
the
therapeutic
process
of
writing.
The
birth
and
development
of
an
idea
or
emotion
is
important
to
me,
as
it
is
to
any
writer.
I
thrive
on
being
moved
by
stories
and
pieces
that
I
read.
I
get
simply
light
headed
at
the
thought
that
something
I
write
could
give
the
same
feeling
to
someone
else.
I
said
earlier
that
I
became
a
writer
when
I
discovered
the
power
behind
the
written
word.
The
lessons
I've
learned
on
how
to
improve
and
develop
that
power
are
invaluable
to
me.
The
resulting
high
is
my
addiction.
It
is
ironic
to
think
that
I
am
indeed
a
writing
junkie,
and
I
still
can't
spell
a
darn
thing.
