This
essay
will
examine
my
writing
experiences
within
the
last
one
year.
These
experiences
have
been
varied
and
none
can
be
said
to
be
ObetterO
than
the
other.
Each
however
has
been
formative
and
has
contributed
to
the
development
of
my
particular
writing
voice
and
style.
I
will
examine
my
experiences
starting
with
my
semester
as
a
WA,
then
look
at
writing
experiences
during
my
semester
abroad.
This
will
then
lead
to
an
examination
of
my
summer
course
and
my
personal
reading
agenda
and
how
each
has
been
formative.
During
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
there
were
many
new
things
to
contend
with.
For
one,
it
was
different
interacting
with
the
class
professor
in
a
dynamic
different
from
that
of
teacher-student
and
form
more
of
a
partnership.
Secondly,
having
to
call
on
my
meager
writing
background,
and
use
that
as
the
authority
with
which
to
conduct
writing
conferences
with
writers
was
daunting.
The
experiences
seemed
so
little
in
light
of
the
task
ahead
and
yet
I
got
the
chance
to
not
only
try
out
my
own
advice
to
writers
but
also
the
College
Writing
ProgramOs.
Testing
different
methodology
given
for
doing
one
task
and
using
it
to
do
another
was
innovative
and
gave
my
writing
experience
a
different
twist
that
was
exciting.
Far
from
the
dull
outlook
I
had
predicted,
being
involved
in
othersO
writing
process
gave
me
a
privileged
vantage
point
from
which
to
organize
my
own
writing.
Asking
myself
what
I
would
have
done
in
the
same
situation
was
humbling
and
showed
me
how
great
an
effort
some
writers
put
into
their
work,
and
how
little
others
did,
but
always
a
variety.
My
spring
semester
abroad
in
Sydney
will
remain
etched
in
my
mind
as
one
of
the
best
educational
experiences
during
my
college
career.
In
addition
to
living
in
a
city
that
offered
cultural
events
ranging
from
Police
museums
to
Writing
Festivals,
the
Post-Colonial
class
I
took
also
contributed
greatly
to
enhance
my
experience.
As
an
English
class,
Post-Colonial
Literature
was
a
writing
intensive
course.
Australian
universities
expect
very
different
material
from
what
is
taught
here
in
the
US.
While
American
colleges
might
emphasise
the
OIO
to
appear
as
strongly
as
possible
in
order
to
take
possession
of
the
ideas
and
own
them,
the
Australian
system
relies
on
tradition.
A
student
is
expected
to
build
upon
what
has
been
said
by
earlier
experts
and
then
towards
the
end,
come
up
with
own
ideas
and
reflections,
but
only
after
establishing
what
has
been
done
in
the
particular
field
of
study
so
far.
The
differences
between
these
two
systems
were
quite
frustrating
when
I
began
to
write
for
my
Post-Colonial
class.
It
seemed
that
I
would
never
be
able
to
summarise
all
that
had
been
done
earlier
in
the
field
in
order
to
get
to
the
point
where
I
would
be
making
my
own
conclusions.
Soon,
however,
the
beauty
of
this
way
of
writing
was
revealed
to
me.
It
required
a
lot
of
research
which
was
easily
visible
rather
than
being
lost
in
between
my
own
words
as
might
happen
when
I
tend
to
use
too
much
of
the
OIO
in
my
essays.
Furthermore,
the
particular
way
of
writing
an
introduction
that
the
class
required
was
very
useful.
Each
introduction
served
more
than
just
a
heads-up
of
what
the
paper
would
be
about.
It
served
as
a
road
map
letting
the
reader
know
where
and
how
the
paper
was
going,
in
this
way,
avoiding
both
surprises
and
confusion.
I
know
that
I
intend
to
pursue
English
at
a
post-grad
level,
and
thus
this
class
was
useful
to
widen
my
background
and
prepare
me
for
future
studies.
The
particular
writing
style
that
I
acquired
will,
however,
be
useful
even
out
of
the
English
discipline.
It
was
a
formative
writing
experience
that
will
influence
the
way
I
not
only
do
my
own
writing,
but
also
how
I
conduct
conferences
with
other
writers
and
WAOs.
This
summer,
I
took
English
128:
American
Jewish
Literature.
Before
I
went
to
the
class,
I
had
had
no
expectations,
and
considered
it
to
be
just
another
class
which
while
different
from
what
I
had
done
before,
would
soon
be
forgotten,
how
wrong
I
was.
The
material
in
the
class
proved
to
be
quite
fascinating.
It
was
exciting
to
bury
myself
in
the
collective
memory
of
the
Jewish
community
in
the
US.
It
became
clear
to
me
quite
early
on
that
there
is
great
diversity
in
this
term
OJewO.
From
the
Orthodox
sects
to
the
Reformed
variety,
there
was
a
lot
more
than
I
had
picked
up
on
from
Jerry
SeinfeldOs
one-liners.
That
variety
increased
with
the
different
writers
who
attempted
to
communicate
their
experiences.
As
we
drew
farther
and
farther
from
the
early
period
of
immigration;
Seventeenth
century,
female
voices
began
to
appear
in
the
collection
of
material
providing
a
whole
new
way
to
look
at
the
American
Jewish
community.
The
clear
articulation
of
these
writers
left
me
inspired.
It
was
enlightening
to
read
about
the
generation
gap
problem
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
Cornell
college
student.
So
too
was
reading
about
the
Russian
pogroms
from
a
newly-arrived
immigrant.
The
suffering,
the
hope
and
the
renewal
that
these
writing
had
could
not
leave
anybody
untouched.
It
therefore
was
no
surprise
when
I
started
dabbling
with
poetry.
I
have
attempted
to
write
poems
before
but
after
a
short
period
of
time
I
would
give
up
and
stop,
discouraged
that
I
had
nothing
OimportantO
to
say.
The
summer
class
however
showed
me
that
nothing
is
worthless,
and
that
every
experience
I
have
is
worth
contemplating
and
trying
to
put
in
words.
Writing
my
own
poetry
and
reading
it
out
loud
in
class
was
an
experience
I
would
recommend
to
any
young
writer.
It
is
one
thing
to
write
and
edit
and
revise
on
the
computer,
it
is
quite
another
to
offer
your
work
to
an
audience
and
listen
as
they
tear
it
apart
for
meaning.
I
would
flinch
each
time
something
I
had
tried
to
say
was
misinterpreted,
I
would
also
get
elated
when
the
audience
saw
my
words
in
totally
new
ways
and
made
associations
I
had
not
thought
of
while
writing.
This
experience
has
taught
me
that
the
reader
will
always
bring
something
to
the
partnership
of
writing.
Rather
than
viewing
the
writing
and
so
too
the
WA
process
as
a
one
way
stream
where
the
writer
comes
to
me,
the
WA,
I
now
look
at
it
as
a
bridge
where
the
writer
and
I
attempt
to
bring
our
experiences
to
a
common
point.
The
closer
we
get,
I
feel,
the
more
chances
that
the
writer
has
managed
to
bring
across
many
of
the
issues
at
hand
and
thus
the
less
tedious
the
editing
process
will
be.
It
however
is
necessary
to
point
out
that,
my
experiences
that
I
come
with
as
a
reader,
will
not
necessarily
be
the
same
as
that
of
the
professor
or
fellow
students
that
the
writer
in
question
is
trying
to
communicate
to.
It
thus
cannot
be
taken
for
granted
that
what
works
for
one
reader
will
work
for
all.
What
the
professor
may
love
might
make
absolutely
no
sense
to
a
WA.
This
leaves
the
student
confused
and
yet
at
a
great
vantage
point.
Understanding
that
writing
is
a
very
specific
act,
and
that
it
involves
decisions
on
whom
to
include
or
exclude
is
vital
to
bettering
oneOs
writing
voice.
These
very
conflicts
are
what
make
writing
so
exciting,
demanding
and
fulfilling
at
the
end
when
one
understands
how
difficult
it
is
to
transmit
ideas
from
one
mind
to
another
and
have
them
understood
exactly
as
one
wishes.
It
is
indeed
awe-inspiring
to
have
that
kind
of
power.
This,
truly
a
kind
of
veneration,
is
the
right
attitude
with
which
to
approach
each
writing
task.
One
particular
experience
that
has
helped
me
challenge
my
way
of
thinking
about
writing
has
ironically
not
being
about
writing
exactly,
but
about
the
one
thing
that
goes
hand
in
hand
with
writing:
reading.
I
have
taken
it
upon
myself
to
read
as
widely
as
possible,
literature
in
not
only
English,
my
third
language,
but
also
in
my
two
other
languages
from
Kenya.
Reading
in
another
language
is
an
experience
that
challenges
my
expectations
in
writing.
The
difference
in
grammatical
formations
affects
the
style
of
the
writing
making
it
either
more
or
less
accessible
to
me
as
a
reader.
These
experiences
affect
me
as
a
writer
by
putting
me
off
from
writing
using
the
realism
style,
and
urging
me
to
be
more
experimental.
While
not
many
students
in
US
colleges
are
totally
proficient
in
a
second
language
to
the
level
of
English,
they
never
the
less
have
unique
idiosyncrasies
from
their
backgrounds.
The
kind
of
writing
they
have
bee
exposed
to,
in
addition
to
the
kind
of
education
affects
this.
Just
like
I
enjoy
reading
in
either
Kikuyu
or
Swahili,
they
too
would
have
particular
styles
they
have
adopted
as
ObestO
for
particular
types
of
writing
labeling
and
categorising
while
useful
in
the
early
years
might
pigeon-hole
a
writer
to
keep
doing
the
same
thing
over
and
over
without
any
innovations
and
development.
It
is
crucial
for
one
to
be
open
and
lend
themselves
to
the
process
and
see
where
it
takes
them.
To
accept
the
way
a
piece
of
writing
is
turning
and
not
lock
it
off
is
one
of
the
advice
Richard
Bausch
gives
students
in
The
Norton
Anthology
of
Short
Fiction.
Furthermore,
by
reading
ground
breaking
works
by
renowned
writer
Ngugi
wa
Thiongo
in
his
mother
tongue
Kikuyu
it
has
become
clear
to
me
that
style
is
malleable
and
can
be
remolded
to
fit
a
particular
purpose.
In
conclusion,
the
one
thing
that
all
these
experiences
have
shown
me
is
the
great
variety
there
is
and
can
be
within
writing.
Any
essay
on
a
particular
subject
can
be
written
in
many
ways,
it
is
up
to
the
writer
to
make
conscious
choice
and
settle
on
one
rather
than
the
other
style.
This
point
of
awareness
will
be
the
main
point
I
will
try
to
bring
across
to
writers
during
my
writing
conferences.
Appreciation
of
the
power
a
writer
has
over
the
readerOs
understanding
places
the
writing
process
in
the
proper
context;
as
something
personal
that
cannot
be
delegated
by
WAOs
or
professors.
Until
such
a
time
that
a
writer
can
decide
of
his/her
own
volition
to
do
OaO
rather
than
ObO,
not
because
that
is
what
every
other
student
will
do,
but
because
it
brings
out
a
particular
point
better,
writing
will
remain
a
daunting
if
not
unnecessary
task
to
many.
Appreciating
the
power
of
a
comma
here,
rather
than
there,
the
use
of
one
word
rather
than
another
will
bring
out
the
importance
of
looking
carefully
at
details
that
would
otherwise
be
considered
minute
and
inconsequential.
