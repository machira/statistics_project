Life
or
Learning:
My
Year
as
Student
of
Human
Rights
and
Literature
For
every
student
of
writing
there
exists
an
equal
number
of
year-long
paths
of
structural
evolution
or
creative
atrophy;
all
differ,
further,
and
retreat
in
unique,
singular
patterns.
These
patterns
shape
every
individual
student
into
an
individual
writer.
As
a
self-identified
individual
thinker
and
writer,
I
may
have
just
erected
an
unfair
binary,
isolating
the
predicable
structured
from
the
feral
creative;
however,
such
assumptions
and
observations
became
the
beauty
of
my
year
as
a
writer
and
student
of
the
world.
Every
perspective
changes
within
a
greater
perspective,
as
does
every
assignment
within
a
greater
curriculum;
composition
changes
from
idiom
to
idiom,
as
it
does
from
culture
to
culture.
This
I
learned
studying
abroad
in
Argentina
last
fall
as
a
self-elected
student
of
human
rights,
and
a
compulsory
student
of
castellano.
In
one
Argentina,
the
the
id
and
the
creative
mind
became
the
evolved,
while
uniformity,
and
the
composition
of
the
establishment,
became
the
easy
and
unlearned.
Artistic
growth
characterized
the
Argentina
before
the
dictatorship,
and
the
Argentina
that
preceded
it.
While
I
have
evolved
freely
as
both
structural
and
creative
writer,
Argentines
suffered
through
seven
years
of
government-sponsored
restriction
of
the
creative
process.
In
my
year
as
a
writer,
learning
of
ArgentinaOs
choice,
life
or
education,
has
guided
my
own
work
into
restrained,
applied
creativity.
By
studying
social
movements
and
human
rights,
the
assignments
became,
NDescribe
la
crisis
del
2001.
Seale
de
qu
manera
los

polticos,
econmicos
y
sociales
recientes
afectaron
en
el

la
Argentina,O
or,
NDescribe
the
crisis
of
2001.
Indicate
in
what
ways
the
recent
political,
economic,
and
social
changes
affected
the
rise
of
new
social
movements
in
Argentina,O
from
NWhat

you
Ostrike

between
a
modernist

and
a
contemporary?
Is
it
dangerous?
Do
they
argue?
Is
a
clear
path
of
creative
evolution
identifiable,
and
are
there
gaps?
O
Creative
movement
within
the
assignments
quickly
shrunk,
though
it
seemed
that
my
discomfort
with
the
language
actually
had
its
advantages.
Rather
than
toy
with
syntax
and
semantics,
I
got
to
the
point,
then
handed
it
in.
My
insights
were
into
the
connection
between
the
international
media
coverage
of
the
1978
FIFA
World
Cup
in
Argentina
and
the
toppling
of
the
Leopoldo
GaltieriOs
terror-led
dictatorship,
rather
than
into
a
deconstructionist
reading
of
KeatsO
NWhen
I
Have
Fears
That
I
May
Cease
to
Be.O
My
incomplete
thoughts
on
paper
were
evidence
of
an
ongoing
learning
process-
and,
for
some
reason,
my
writing
was
at
ease.
Perhaps
as
I
became
surrounded
in
a
world
of
living
history,
I
felt
more
like
a
juvenile
reporter
than
a
disjointed
scholar;
perhaps
I
did
not
have
to
convince
the
world
of
everything
I
knew,
and
nothing
I
did
not.
At
any
rate,
it
was
evident
that
as
I
typed
tildeOs
and
upside-down
question
marks
onto
my
computer
screen,
I
found
myself
in
unfamiliar
territory,
and
thrived
within
it.
As
I
reflect
on
my
development
as
a
writer
in
one
year
I
see,
unapologetically,
that
these
last
twelve
months
have
been
the
most
significant
in
my
writing
history
for
their
regression,
rather
than
advancement.
As
my
ideas
began
to
be
lost
in
translation,
I
learned
to
write
all
over
again.
In
the
forthcoming
year,
I
foresee
a
channeling
of
my
linguistic
regression
into
healthy,
structural
advancement.
Upon
my
arrival
in
Buenos
Aires,
I
quickly
swapped
identities
from
the
Writing
Associate
to
the
WA-ed,
not
only
in
class
but
in
my
own
cultural
experiences.
My
Universidad
de
Buenos
Aires,
Facultad
de
Filosofia
y
Letras
professors
highlighted
my
misconceptions
in
social
movement
theory
and
Spanish
language
composition,
while
in
casual
conversation
my
porteo
friends
corrected
my
lunfardo,
or
colloquial
Spanish
of
Buenos
Airesians.
In
the
pristine
local
and
national
museums,
Spanish
exhibit
text
and
its
English
translations
served
as
guides
to
my
own
translations
from
an
English
thinking
brain
to
a
Spanish
speaking
mouth.
No
doubt,
the
sentence
structure
does
not
change
a
great
deal
from
one
Western
language
to
the
next,
but
the
words
that
compose
them
certainly
do.
This
is
where
I
arrived
at
Argentine
WA
revelation
number
one:
even
though
the
WA
and
her
or
his
student
may
speak
the
same
official
language,
the
steps
towards
its
comprehension
can
seriously
differ
between
them.
Variety
is
the
spice
of
life,
but
in
certain
conference
situations
preferences
in
sentence
structure
can
impede
grammatical
correctness.
Directly
related
is
Argentine
WA
experience
number
two:
as
English
to
Spanish
translation
can
lose
meaning
in
translation,
so
can
what
is
thought
by
the
WA
student,
and
what
is
actually
communicated.
In
my
own
WA
experience,
this
has
led
me
to
rid
conferences
of
all
questions
with
yes
or
no
answers,
and
to
emphasize
those
which
require
interaction
by
the
student.
I
recall
making
certain
one-word-answer
missteps
in
my
initial
conferences
with
the
questions:
NDo
you
think
that
you
accomplished
the
goals
of
this
assignment?O
Or,
NDo
you
understand
what
I
am
suggesting
for
revision?O
Both
can
be
answered
with
a
head
nod
or
a
hesitant
Nyes,O
and
such
an
answer,
even
if
true,
tells
nothing
about
why
the
student
feels
she
or
he
adequately
completed
the
assignment,
or
how
she
or
he
can
successfully
revise
the
composition.
Also,
movement
from
statements
that
clearly
point
out
errors
to
instead
asking
neutral
questions
allows
the
student
to
find
her
or
his
own
errors,
and
is
essential
to
opening
communication
in
a
conference
session.
In
my
own
experience,
getting
back
an
ejercicio
escrito
covered
in
red
marks
in
abbreviated,
somewhat
unintelligible
Spanish
felt
a
lot
worse
than
a
few
bulleted
questions
at
the
end
of
the
document.
Rather
than
hop
the
subte
to
my
homestay
with
a
magnifying
glass
and
a
box
of
Kleenex,
those
few
questions
led
me
to
a
group
peer
review
session,
caf,
and
a
friendly
appointment
with
my
professor.
Unfortunately,
in
a
story
unlike
those
of
many
other
public
education
systems,
Argentine
public
schools
have
oft
been
denied
the
government
funding
necessary
for
beneficial
student-teacher
ratios,
facility
maintenance,
and
the
sustainability
of
offices
contributing
to
student
success
and
retention.
Professors
were
often
difficult
to
contact
outside
of
the
classroom,
and
inside
the
classroom,
they
seemed
overtired,
distracted,
and
fed
up
with
the
lack
of
heat
and
classroom
resources.
Therefore,
after
half-understanding
a
lecture
on
the
depressed
villas
de
emergencia
that
have
developed
on
the
fringes
of
major
cities
and
attempting
to
find
the
professor
during
his
office
hours
in
la
Facultad
de
Derechos
across
the
city-
to
only
realize
that
such
hours
were
very
flexible-
any
real
efforts
to
meet
for
an
essay
revision
were
seriously
hampered.
This
was
in
major
contrast
with
Lafayette,
where
WAs
and
WA-ees
have
countless
factors
working
in
their
favor.
Although
it
may
come
close,
students
are
never
relegated
to
seating
outside
the
door
of
a
lecture
hall
and
professors
are
required
to
hold
steady,
weekly
office
hours.
Students
are
encouraged
and
often
required
to
meet
with
professors
outside
the
classroom
and,
on
a
small,
undergraduate
residential
campus
of
2,300
students,
peer
review
can
easily
become
an
unplanned
event.
In
comparison,
la
Universidad
de
Buenos
Aires
hosts
a
graduate
and
undergraduate
program
of
approximately
289,526
students
across
a
city
of
12,129,819,
with
no
main
campus.
In
the
UBA
system,
as
in
other
large
universities,
students
can
easily
fall
through
the
cracks
and
writing
skills
go
unchecked,
then
unrefined.
Until
I
took
a
step
away
from
my
Lafayette
identity
as
the
WA
and
the
WA-ed,
I
did
not
realize
how
valuable
both
of
these
positions
truly
were.
In
a
major
way,
my
writing
style
regressed
in
complexity
not
only
as
a
result
of
the
language
barrier,
but
from
the
lack
of
a
College
Writing
Program.
I
was
initially
wary
to
conference
with
my
homestay
mother
even
after
her
repetitive
demands
of,
N!Dmelo,
dmelo!
S
que
tens
ideas
brillantes!O
simply
because
I
was
afraid
to
appear
a
grammatical
fool.
At
the
same
time,
my
stubbornness-
which
seemed
to
impede
my
learning
process-
may
have
proved
essential
in
my
return
to
the
basics.
I
had
to
learn
to
mold
direct
object
pronouns,
verbs,
and
proper
nouns
together
again
using
the
correct
conjugations
and
transition
words
to
get
to
the
point,
rather
than
make
the
point
seem
pretty.
Spanish
class
lecturas,
or
lessons,
not
only
examined
the
proper
construction
of
a
sentence
in
the
past
subjunctive,
but
transformed
transition
words
from
overused
English
paper
linkages
to
Spanish
tools
of
power
in
the
debate
over
the
rights
of
piqueteros,
or
the
mobilized
Argentine
unemployed,
and
the
right
to
an
abortion
in
a
country
heavily
rooted
in
the
Catholic
Church,
for
example.
Not
surprisingly,
my
attentiveness
to
English
diction
has
evolved;
I
have
overcome
a
serious
case
of
the
Nthereforeitis,O
or
the
use
of
therefore
to
convince
both
oneOs
audience-
namely
professors
of
the
major
sciences
and
oneself-
that
oneOs
knowledge
of
the
subject
matter
is
much
more
extensive
than
it
in
reality
is.
Over
the
course
of
four
months,
the
enormous
growth
of
my
Spanish
writing
skills
mirrored
my
reconnection
with
the
English
compositional
styles
that
I
had
once
assumed
intuitive.
My
field-based
abroad
experience
culminated
in
the
Independent
Study
Project
(ISP),
a
School
for
International
Training
trademark
that
consists
of
an
oral
presentation
and
forty
page
minimum
research
paper
incorporating
extensive
background
investigation,
lengthy
personal
interviews,
and
innovative
analysis-
all
in
polished
Castillian
Spanish.
My
final
project
was
a
week-late
sixty-five
page
masterpiece
entitled
RLa
Marcha
de
los
Militantes,
la
Marcha
de
la
Mercadera
o
la
Marcha
de
las
Molestias?:
Magnificando
Cada
Color-
Y
Cada
Distorsin-
del
Arco
Iris
en
La
XVI
Marcha
Del
Orgullo
LGBTI
Buenos
Aires.
In
the
five
weeks
of
its
completion,
I
experienced
first-hand
the
development
of
a
primary
source
through
field
work,
a
side
to
the
research
process
that
I
had
not
previously
encountered
in
my
secondary
source
pursuits.
Through
careful
planning
of
general
questions
such
as,
NDo
you
identify
as
part
of
the
march,
part
of
the
contramarch,
or
as
an
onlooker?O
and,
NHow
did
you
find
out
about
the
event,O
I
was
able
to
organize
each
of
the
thirty
interviewees
qualitatively
by
their
roles
in
the
march,
and
analyze
the
significance
of
their
role-based
answers.
This
field
work
was
certainly
no
JSTOR;
with
a
strong
gringa
accent
and
within
the
MarchOs
strict
six
hour
timeframe,
I
compiled
into
my
cuaderno
de
campo
photographs,
moving
personal
stories
and
artifacts
from
participating
protesting
and
organizations.
After
several
meetings
with
my
ISP
advisor,
program
director,
Spanish
professor,
and
all
of
the
unofficial
WAs
of
my
Argentine
support
system,
my
project
was
ultimately
picked
up
by
a
major
publisher-
myself-
and
handed
in.
My
study
abroad
experience
had
reached
its
end,
and
its
synthesis
had
begun.
After
paying
careful
attention
to
the
wording
and
symbolic
representations
on
Argentine
billboards
and
traffic
signals,
all
North
American
text
was
suddenly
up
for
equal
scrutiny.
A
McDonaldOs
sign
became
more
than
a
textual
representation
of
the
restaurant
that
lies
behind
it,
but
became
a
carefully
engineered
piece
of
symbolism.
McDonald-
the
California
country
bumpkin
who
clearly
grilled
at
each
and
every
McDonaldOs
in
North
America-
captured
customerOs
eyes,
hearts,
and
wallets
with
his
image
as
a
traditional
American
icon
who
put
perfect
grill
marks
on
every
patty,
and
stayed
consistent,
even
as
the
world
changed.
The
signs,
nor
the
menu
inside,
mentioned
anything
about
the
NMacDonaldizationO
of
119
countries,
or
that
the
McDonald
brothers
have
had
no
fiscal
connection
to
the
corporation
since
1961.
Clearly,
I
could
not
resist
analyzing
my
surroundings,
and
quickly
became
disgusted
with
books
I
had
once
enjoyed,
blogs
I
had
once
frequented,
and
the
Cape
Cod
Times.
If
the
grammar
was
not
good,
I
was
not
interested.
When
spring
semester
at
Lafayette
had
finally
started,
I
began
to
lose
my
grammatical
snobbery,
as
I
came
to
the
realization
that
I
was
not
the
queen
of
grammar,
and
I
could
never
write
a
grammatically
perfect
seven-book
series
about
a
wizard
from
Surrey
and
his
precarious
adolescence.
As
I
reacquainted
myself
with
the
English
writing
discipline,
I
found
my
wording
more
careful,
my
paragraphs
denser,
and
papers
taking
me
twice
as
long.
Something
had
clearly
been
learned;
my
syntax
was
tighter,
my
paragraphs
were
denser,
and
I
became
a
voracious
self
editor.
As
a
peer
reviewer,
I
found
myself
weighing
content
more
than
linguistic
finesse.
Though
my
small-scale
preoccupations
had
not
disappeared,
my
editing
lens
was
macro,
rather
than
micro;
I
saw
where
paragraphs
could
move,
where
new
ideas
could
be
inserted,
and
where
my
understanding
of
the
composition
fell
into
a
black
hole.
Each
word
did
matter,
and
as
peer
reviewer
I
could
certainly
provide
organizational
and
ideational
guidance.
It
was
up
to
the
student,
however,
to
put
her
or
his
thoughts
into
her
or
his
own
words.
I
have
also
learned
that,
while
not
everyone
may
be
a
WA,
anyone-
roommate,
home
stay
mother,
morning
milkman-
cam
be
a
WB,
or
Writing
Buddy.
Even
without
proper
training,
a
writer
should
never
turn
down
another
set
of
eyes.
The
spring
semester
at
Lafayette
was
a
term
of
quick
adjustment.
Both
inspired
by
great
Argentine
novelists
Borges,
Sabto,
and
Hernndez,
and
by
a
perhaps
even
stronger
desire
to
finish
my
major
before
senior
year,
I
threw
my
bilingual
self
into
modern
poetry,
an
NAncient
MarinerO
and
NAncyent
Marinere,O
300
years
of
American
literature,
and
the
music
and
lyrics
of
John
DonneOs
black
melancholic
bile.
Altogether,
the
semester
was
a
successful
one;
as
I
broke
my
bad
writerOs
habit
of
taking
a
few
liberties
with
deadline
-
not
for
partying,
but
for
an
artistOs
reluctance
to
finish
that
which
can
never
justly
be
finished,
I
toyed
with
writing
for
activism.
This
took
the
form
of
on
campus
extracurricular
work,
as
I
worked
with
QuEST
and
LEAP
to
formulate
more
current,
inclusive
mission
statements
and
digitally
reconnected
with
my
summer
employer,
The
Provincetown
Center
for
Coastal
Studies
(PCCS).
I
had
already
experienced
fundraising
and
applied
communications
as
the
non-profitOs
Marine
Education
and
Community
Outreach
Intern
in
the
summer
of
2006,
and
one
summer
later,
had
worked
with
the
then-head
of
PCCS
Marine
Education
to
translate
her
wealth
of
cetological
knowledge
into
alluring,
informative,
and
most
importantly
factual,
exhibit
text.
This
text
was
then
transformed
by
our
visual
artist
into
eight
attractive
posters,
as
I
hunted
down
long-lost
photo
credits,
fact
checked,
shadowed
the
layout
process,
hoisted
whale
bones
out
of
truck
beds
and
organized
interactive
touch
tables,
and
whale
identification
charts.
This
summer,
no
finback
whale
scapulas
needed
tagging
and
heavy
lifting.
Instead,
as
PCCS
Exhibit/Store
Attendant,
I
worked
to
educate
fin-struck
visitors
about
the
marine
mammal
population
in
the
nearby
Stellwagen
Bank
National
Marine
Sanctuary,
the
research
and
rescue
programs
pioneered
thirty
years
ago
by
the
CenterOs
founders,
and
current
pro-conservation
governmental
legislation,
and,
as
visitors
were
overcome
by
pure
education-induced
euphoria,
I
snuck
in
a
PCCS
membership
plug.
For
me,
it
was
a
real
game
with
rhetoric.
Working
in
such
close
quarters
with
the
CenterOs
executive
director
had
its
perks.
Within
a
self-crafted
internship,
I
wrote
articles
for
the
quarterly
membership
newsletter,
dabbled
in
commercial
visual
art,
led
a
search
for
NOAA
and
NSF
grants
through
the
ESRI
Grant
Application
Assistance
Program,
and
attended
meetings
of
the
Massachusetts
Ocean
Partnership,
a
government-funded
agency
that
has
achieved
the
state
recognition
of
the
first-in-the-nation
Ocean
Act.
Over
one
year,
I
moved
from
quiet
sponge
of
Argentine
activist
literature
to
confident
environmental
law
enthusiast,
and
I
began
to
write-
for
only
the
second
time-
for
a
living.
Even
though
my
research
led
to
The
Provincetown
Banner
rather
than
the
Antioch
Review,
I
was
still
passionate,
interested,
and
driven,
while
unafraid
to
dive
firsthand
into
writing
disciplines
outside
of
those
within
my
Lafayette
career.
There
were
undoubtedly
major
crossroads;
both
Ahab
and
the
Provincetown
Center
for
Coastal
Studies
had
at
least
one
common
target,
only
with
very
different
objectives.
