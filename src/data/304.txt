New
WA
Writing
Assignment
It
all
began
with
my
need
for
attention.
I
was
the
first
in
my
grade
to
write,
and
my
efforts
as
a
child
earned
me
praise
both
in
school
and
at
home.
In
kindergarten
I
was
even
sent
to
a
special
teacher
who
worked
with
my
"excelled
needs."
From
plays,
to
narratives,
to
simple
poetry,
after
I
mastered
the
basics
I
was
quick
to
display
what
I
had
the
potential
to
do.
After
some
time,
writing
quickly
transformed
from
a
display
of
education
and
creativity
to
a
personal
release
and
true
love
for
expression
and
language.
Both
my
writing
and
my
motives
for
writing
have
undergone
many
changes.
Over
the
course
of
the
past
14
years,
writing
has
gone
from
an
attention
grabbing
opportunity
for
personal
enjoyment
to
an
introspective
outlet
for
complicated
thoughts
and
feelings
and
academic
ideas.
The
summer
after
kindergarten,
I
was
ready
to
start
writing
the
next
"great
American
novel."
This
novel,
or
shall
we
say
extremely
short
story,
focused
on
Jill's
journey
home
from
school
and
all
those,
animals
and
humans
alike,
she
encountered
along
the
way.
The
story
was
published
in
my
kitchen
with
the
help
of
my
mother.
The
publication,
which
took
about
one
month
to
produce,
was
fully
illustrated
and
was
written
in
my
painfully
perfect
first
grade
penmanship.
Every
time
I
was
given
the
opportunity
to
share
my
work
with
friends
or
family,
I
felt
as
if
the
pride
I
felt
would
cause
me
to
write
forever.
After
completing
the
next
great
American
novel,
I
ventured
into
the
cynical,
cutthroat
genre
of
theater
at
age
7.
As
an
enthusiastic
playwright,
my
area
of
expertise
centered
on
plays
involving
my
cousins
at
family
bar-be-ques
and
lengthy
puppet
shows
performed
in
my
backyard.
These
puppet
shows
involved
such
intricate
plots
as
Penny
the
Penguin
stealing
George
the
Giraffe's
wallet,
and
Lucy
losing
her
dog
and
finding
it
with
the
assistance
of
Steve
the
Sheriff.
However,
my
largest
accomplishment
as
a
playwright
came
at
age
8.
I
spend
most
of
my
second
grade
year
drafting
a
version
of
"Stone
Soup."
Although
I
basically
adapted
a
copyrighted
story
into
a
play
with
the
vernacular
of
second
graders,
I
thought
that
I
had
truly
written
something
worthwhile.
I
approached
my
second
grade
teacher
and
asked
if
I
could
perform
the
play
in
school.
After
making
costumes,
I
casted
my
friends
as
characters
and
held
several
rehearsals,
which
I
remember
as
if
they
occurred
yesterday.
Between
the
organization
of
the
play
and
the
performance
of
the
play,
I
believe
I
may
have
been
the
only
second
grader
to
truly
understand
the
meaning
of
stress.
The
production
of
"Stone
Soup"
satisfied
my
need
for
recognition
through
creative
writing
for
quite
some
time.
Before
the
age
of
10,
writing
was
purely
a
creative
outlet
and
a
way
to
earn
praise.
However
as
I
entered
later
elementary
school
and
junior
high,
writing
became
mostly
academic
and
at
times
very
tedious.
Between
the
ages
of
11
and
14,
major
technical
improvements
occurred
in
my
writing.
For
the
most
part,
these
improvements
were
practiced
through
various
forms
of
academic
writing
and
journaling.
One
of
my
predominant
memories
of
writing
at
the
junior
high
level
involved
Mrs.
Burd,
my
middle
school
language
teacher,
going
through
every
single
form
of
all
the
words
on
the
board.
This
time
was
also
marked
by
long
lists
of
vocabulary
words
to
be
copied
down
and
definitions
to
be
precisely
memorized.
All
of
the
mundane
necessities
that
were
pounded
into
my
head
at
the
time
became
the
foundation
for
the
less
than
mundane
writing
that
I
would
do
in
high
school.
As
is
the
case
for
many
individuals,
high
school
was
an
intellectual
jolt,
much
like
the
electric
currents
used
to
awaken
a
heart
that
is
not
beating.
Academically,
it
was
the
first
time
I
had
ever
been
forced
to
critically
evaluate
both
the
context
and
the
style
of
my
writing,
and
realize
that
they
were
not
up
to
the
highest
standards.
I
was
exposed
to
many
different
genres
of
writing,
and
was
forced
to
break
the
writing
routines
into
which
I
had
fallen.
Then
I
came
to
the
realization
that
was
both
frustrating
and
liberating.
That
realization
was
that
no
matter
how
I
write,
it
will
never
right
for
every
individual.
A
paper
that
may
be
the
archetype
of
an
ideal
paper
according
to
one
teacher,
may
be
absolute
rubbish
for
another
teacher.
At
that
junction,
is
when
I
realized
that
I
must
write
for
no
one
but
myself.
While
I
completed
(and
still
do
complete)
all
my
assignments
based
on
the
specifics
of
the
assignment
and
the
teacher,
I
realized
that
the
world
of
writing
is
so
subjective
that
not
only
would
I
never
become
close
to
perfect,
I
could
also
never
put
my
own
writing
on
a
pedestal.
I
realized
that
that
is
exactly
what
it
is...
it
is
my
writing,
not
the
wrong
way,
but
not
necessarily
the
only
right
way
either.
This
realization
allowed
me
to
better
connect
with
other
students
struggling
with
their
writing
and
to
better
look
objectively
at
my
own
writing.
Then
I
met
Ajay,
a
fellow
freshman.
Never
had
I
thought
of
the
world
in
quite
the
way
that
Ajay
perceived
the
world.
Reading
his
writing
was
like
opening
my
eyes
for
the
first
time.
He
made
great
use
of
obscure
metaphors
to
convey
complicated
feelings
in
a
clear,
concise
way.
Journaling
and
poetry
had
always
been
apart
of
my
writing
life,
but
not
until
I
met
Ajay
did
those
activities
become
so
important.
His
writings
inspired
me
to
incorporate
more
depth
and
description
into
my
own
writing,
especially
into
poetry.
It
was
during
my
freshman
year
of
high
school
that
my
own
writing
style
completely
changed.
It
was
the
first
time
that
I
was
able
to
break
away
from
all
the
lessons
that
I
had
been
taught
on
the
blackboard,
and
truly
use
language,
in
any
way
necessary,
to
convey
what
needed
to
be
said.
The
combination
of
increased
technical
ability
and
anew
mindset,
took
my
writing
from
elementary
to
relatively
sophisticated
in
both
a
creative
writing
sense
and
an
academic
writing
sense.
I
had
very
strong
English
teachers
throughout
high
school.
One
such
individual
was
my
freshman
year
English
teacher
who
taught
me
to
read
critically
and
write
in
the
same
fashion.
To
this
day
I
still
consult
her
for
a
second
opinion
on
papers.
Over
the
course
of
high
school,
I
developed
as
a
writer
until
I
was
ready
to
face
the
ultimate
challenge
as
a
high
school
teacher,
my
senior
AP
English
teacher.
He
had
a
reputation
for
ripping
students
apart
and
turning
them
off
to
writing.
As
expected,
he
scrutinized
and
criticized
every
piece
of
writing
I
submitted,
often
contradicting
lessons
that
I
had
learned
from
many
other
teachers
in
the
past.
It
was
at
this
point
in
my
writing
career
that
the
lesson
I
learned
regarding
the
necessity
to
write
only
for
myself
had
its
full
impact.
I
continued
to
write
academic
papers
for
him,
taking
what
advice
I
could,
but
being
faithful
to
myself
as
a
writer
and
not
completely
altering
my
style.
As
high
school
continued
and
I
matured,
I
realized
with
the
help
of
this
teacher,
that
my
writing
was
never
as
strong
as
I
had
hoped
it
was
at
the
time.
By
the
end
of
my
senior
in
high
school,
the
poems
that
I
wrote
freshman
year,
which
at
that
time
were
revolutionary,
all
sounded
sub
par
and
overdone.
I
make
it
my
mission
my
senior
year
to
take
all
the
poems
I
had
written
earlier
in
my
high
school
career
and
revise
them,
focusing
on
originally
and
sophistication.
I
submitted
these
revised
poems
as
a
creative
writing
sample
to
the
same
AP
English
teacher.
The
teacher
had
no
idea
what
guts
it
took
for
me
to
submit
the
poetry,
since
very
rarely
do
I
let
anyone
read
my
poetry,
let
alone
a
substantial
amount
of
it.
After
I
received
a
100
on
the
assignment,
I
realized
that
this
teacher
truly
had
been
influential,
because
for
one
of
the
first
times
in
my
life
I
could
honestly
say
that
I
did
not
really
care
what
grade
I
received
on
the
assignment.
The
process
of
the
revision
led
to
the
personal
enlightenment
that
I
could
advance
my
writing
to
the
next
level.
While
there
have
been
many
times
like
the
year
I
spent
with
that
AP
English
teacher
struggling
with
negative
writing
critiques,
there
have
also
been
times
when
I
have
been
grateful
that
my
writing
was
well
received.
The
scholarship
application
time
senior
year
of
high
school
was
one
time
during
which
I
wish
I
did
not
have
the
ability
to
write.
I,
along
with
my
fellow
classmates,
was
being
asked
to
produce
cliched
essay
after
cliched
essay.
It
got
tiresome,
and
I
will
even
admit
to
submitting
to
the
tearjerker
status
quo
of
a
scholarship-winning
essay.
However,
there
was
one
contest
that
inspired
me
to
write
more
truthfully
than
I
even
realized
I
could.
In
response
to
a
national
essay
contest
that
posed
the
question
what
have
sports
taught
you?
,
I
responded
in
the
most
honest
fashion
I
could.
I
wrote
3000
words
on
why
sports
have
taught
me
not
to
value
sports.
As
a
12
varsity
letter
winner
in
high
school
this
may
have
appeared
to
be
a
hypocritical
essay.
However,
the
essay
that
was
produced
as
a
result
of
that
contest
was
personally
one
of
my
favorite
pieces
of
writing.
When
the
judges
agreed
with
me
and
awarded
me
all
the
prizes
that
went
along
with
winning,
including
money
and
tickets
to
championship
game
of
the
NCAA
basketball
tournament,
it
simply
concluded
one
major
positive
writing
experience
in
my
life.
However,
some
writing
tasks
were
far
from
natural
for
me.
One
of
the
most
challenging
writing
assignments
of
my
entire
life
occurred
at
the
end
of
my
senior
year.
I
had
to
compose
the
valedictorian
address
for
my
high
school
graduation.
The
complete
freedom
to
have
the
attention
of
thousands
among
thousands
of
people
and
say
whatever
I
wished
was
one
of
the
most
daunting
tasks
I
had
ever
faced
as
a
writer.
I
had
so
much
freedom
it
was
almost
restraining.
I
put
a
tremendous
amount
of
pressure
on
myself
to
be
innovative,
interesting,
and
unique.
My
speech
would
have
to
be
captivating,
yet
intelligent.
At
the
time
of
high
ambition,
I
did
not
even
comprehend
how
difficult
that
task
was
going
to
be.
When
I
could
not
think
of
anything
earth
shattering
to
say,
I
felt
like
an
athlete
choking
on
the
day
of
the
championship.
My
graduation
speech
was
the
first
writing
assignment
that
I
had
ever
revised
more
than
twice
in
my
life;
I
revised
twice
the
day
of
graduation
alone.
Delivering
the
speech
that
I
had
written
was
one
of
the
proudest
days
of
my
life.
While
that
speech
was
not
earth
shattering
by
any
means
and
would
never
even
be
ranked
on
a
scale
with
the
best
speeches
that
I
have
read
in
my
life,
it
was
written
for
my
classmates
and
myself.
I
spent
the
entire
day
worrying
about
whether
or
not
my
classmates
and
the
audience
would
enjoy
my
speech.
However,
days
after
the
speech
was
delivered
and
long
forgotten
in
most
people's
minds,
I
realized
how
much
fun
the
struggle
to
write
an
original
speech
had
been.
The
training
that
I
received
in
high
school
made
my
college
writing
transition
fairly
smooth.
For
me
the
switch
to
college
writing
was
very
similar
to
the
switch
from
writing
for
one
teacher
as
opposed
to
writing
for
another
teacher.
While
every
teacher
has
their
specific
preferences,
I
did
not
notice
enough
of
a
vast
difference
between
the
requirements
of
high
school
writing
and
college
writing
to
create
a
problem.
The
only
significant
difference
that
I
discovered
in
college
writing
was
the
extreme
focus
on
a
very
narrow
subject
as
opposed
to
the
broader,
more
open-ended
topics
that
I
was
used
to
focusing
on
in
high
school.
This
change
helped
my
writing
to
stay
more
focused,
since
I
tend
to
be
wordy
when
covering
a
broad
topic.
My
first
grade
on
a
college
writing
paper
was
slightly
below
excellent.
While
it
was
not
incredibly
low,
it
showed
me
that
I
had
room
to
adjust
to
the
added
depth
of
topic
coverage,
and
it
forced
me
to
really
concentrate
on
what
specific
professors
expected
the
students
to
analyze.
I
also
found
that
in
college
my
creative
writing
has
waned
greatly
due
to
the
demands
on
my
time
with
academic
writing
I
believe
that
as
I
have
grown
as
a
person,
I
have
grown
as
a
writer,
almost
in
a
paralleling
fashion.
My
writing
went
from
the
clear-cut,
simple
writing
of
why
tigers
have
stripes,
to
compositions
containing
the
intricate,
complex
argument
as
to
why
God
does
not
exist.
From
writing
with
pencils
and
pens
to
typing
everything
on
my
laptop,
I
have
spent
so
many
hours
struggling
over
the
right
word,
or
where
to
continue
from
a
mental
block.
At
every
stage
along
the
way
I
did
not
fully
realize
the
extent
to
which
I
still
needed
to
grow
as
both
a
writer
and
a
person.
Therefore,
I
do
not
consider
my
development
as
a
writer
anywhere
near
complete.
