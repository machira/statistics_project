I
have
had
many
positive
experiences
with
writing,
which
is
probably
why
I
continue
to
do
it.
From
the
time
I
was
very
young,
writing
was
always
an
activity
and
product
that
was
encouraged,
whether
by
my
teachers
or
my
parents.
I
can
imagine
that
someone
who
was
not
praised
or
applauded
for
his
or
her
early
attempts
at
writing
would
have
a
fairly
stifled
writing
career.
My
experiences
have,
therefore,
played
in
my
favor
to
becoming
a
better
and
diverse
writer.
My
earliest
writing
experience
was
in
a
fairly
unorthodox
medium.
I
would
cite
my
first
attempt
at
writing
creatively
at
2
years
of
age.
Granted,
my
penmanship
was
that
of
a
two-year-old:
non-existent.
I
was
in
the
bathtub
and
was
floating,
letting
my
hair
fan
out
from
my
head.
I
guess
in
the
back
of
my
mind,
it
struck
some
kind
of
creative
nerve
in
my
2-year-old
brain.
My
mother
is
the
only
one
that
remembers
at
the
time,
but
she
remembers
me
beginning
to
improv
a
song
about
mermaids.
And
since
I
was
two,
this
moment
needed
to
be
documented
(of
course).
So
my
mother
took
a
legal
pad,
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bathtub,
and
wrote
down
the
lyrics
that
she
heard
me
singing.
Of
course
the
song
had
no
reason
to
it,
something
about
mermaids
and
briefcases.
The
point
is
that
this
was
the
first
time
where
anyone
can
remember
me
being
even
slightly
creative
with
words.
Despite
the
fact
that
I
did
not
actually
pen
the
song
on
paper
myself,
the
combination
of
the
creative
or
logical
mind,
fused
with
words
and
penmanship
created
my
first
piece
of
writing,
no
matter
who
actually
physically
wrote
the
song
on
paper.
What
makes
writing
a
specific
art
that
is
unique
from
sculpture
or
painting
is
that
it
involves
words.
Even
theater,
for
example,
is
a
kind
of
writing
because
it
all
starts
out
or
ends
up
with
words,
usually
on
some
sort
of
medium
that
can
be
used
and
passed
on
for
others.
With
respect
to
my
writing,
elementary
school
was
kind
of
stagnant
and
uninteresting.
The
first
few
years,
the
teachers
expect
very
little,
if
anything,
out
of
you.
As
long
as
you
can
get
out
of
first
grade
with
some
decent
times
tables,
writing
ability
was
not
going
to
be
a
strong
priority.
Most
of
first
grade
was
filled
with
writing
a
sentence
or
two
about
my
two
goldfish
and
then
illustrating
an
entire
book
to
go
along
with
my
two
sentences.
These
days,
kindergarten
teachers
are
teaching
their
students
how
to
write
their
first
novel,
but
for
some
reason,
the
late-80Os
curriculum
requirements
for
first
graders
were
a
little
less
aggressive.
Critical
writing
and
the
writing
of
N5
paragraph
essaysO
came
in
to
use
around
4thgrade.
Learning
the
structure
to
an
essay
with
the
hourglass
for
introduction
and
conclusion,
3
body
paragraphs
with
three
examples
in
each,
a
structure
that
I
still
find
it
difficult
to
break
out
of.
Essays
in
my
writing
experience
have
grown
on
me
slowly
and
I
only
recently
began
to
appreciate
and
truly
enjoy
the
art
of
the
essay.
However,
for
this
point
in
the
narrative,
it
is
necessary
to
stick
to
my
disillusionment
with
the
form
of
the
essay.
One
of
the
most
painful
aspects
of
the
essay
was
the
medium
in
which
we
were
force
to
use
to
write
them.
Sometime
in
the
early-
to
mid-90Os,
IBM
invented
these
NniftyO
things
called
laptops,
full
clunky
keyboards
with
a
screen
at
the
top
of
them
that
was
a
about
the
length
and
width
of
a
pencil,
and
displayed
only
the
last
10
words
you
had
written.
You
could
only
see
your
full
and
final
product
by
plugging
them
into
the
desktop
computers
and
waiting
45
minutes
for
it
to
upload
into
a
Word
document.
I
found
it
extremely
difficult
to
get
an
essay
written
in
this
fashion.
When
writing
an
essay,
it
is
necessary
to
be
able
to
look
back
to
previous
paragraphs
and
your
thesis
to
strengthen
your
body
paragraphs.
At
that
point,
I
should
have
just
written
the
essay
by
hand.
I
have
no
significant
memory
of
specific
essays
I
wrote
in
elementary
school
but
with
no
regrets.
I
am
sure
many
of
them
were
simply
elongated
book
reports.
I
think
my
sarcasm
and
bitterness
in
writing
about
writing
in
school
comes
from
my
lack
of
faith
in
the
process
and
institutions.
Just
as
it
is
impossible
to
drive
a
car
without
being
taught,
it
is
very
difficult
to
learn
how
to
write
without
being
taught
not
only
the
techniques
but
the
importance
and
manners
of
writing
and
expression,
which
is
something
that
my
districtOs
schools
system
was
in
severe
lack
of.
One
piece
of
writing
that
I
have
a
distinct
memory
of
producing
in
elementary
school
was
something
I
wrote
in
3rd
grade.
It
was
a
creative
writing
piece
that
was
prompted
by
an
in-class
assignment
to
write
about
one
of
Norman
RockwellOs
paintings.
We
had
been
studying
Americana,
I
suppose,
and
Mr.
Pollans
had
hung
various
prints
of
RockwellOs
pieces
around
the
classroom.
It
is
amazing
that
something
that,
at
the
time,
I
had
considered
just
a
writing
assignment
that
I
wanted
to
get
over
with
could
turn
into
the
catalyst
for
my
interest
and
passion
for
creative
writing.
The
Rockwell
piece
was
from
an
early
Saturday
Evening
Post
cover
and
it
portrayed
a
mailman
looking
at
a
postcard,
standing
in
front
of
a
various
mail
slots.
It
is
difficult
to
remember
exactly
how
a
plot
line
comes
about.
It
was
a
fairly
elementary
story
line
but
the
writing
was
unique
and
fairly
advanced
for
a
third
grader.
I
titled
it
NPostcards
for
HenryO
and
wrote
about
how
Henry
the
mailman
would
never
get
postcards
so
he
would
always
read
other
peopleOs
mail
until
one
day
he
was
fired.
A
copy
that
my
mother
still
has
in
a
box
of
my
older
writing
is
typed
and
printed.
Re-reading
the
piece
recently,
I
do
not
ever
recall
handwriting
the
piece.
It
has
a
kind
of
spontaneity
in
the
dialogue
that
makes
it
seem
as
though
it
was
written
quickly
and
never
re-worked
for
anything
besides
grammar.
It
is
interesting,
however,
that
the
spontaneity
in
the
dialogue
does
not
hinder
the
piece
but
makes
it
more
unique
and
authentic,
which
is
something
I
consider
a
great
quality
of
creative
writing.
Age
has
certainly
affected
my
creative
writing,
in
both
positive
and
negative
ways.
An
increase
in
general
understanding
of
how
the
world
works,
other
people
and
how
they
act,
and
experience
in
a
variety
of
situations
increases
a
writer's
ability
to
write
creatively.
It
was
difficult
for
me
as
a
third
grader
to
create
a
very
strong
character
because
I
had
very
little
experience
with
how
someone
in
his
situation
would
react
to
his
environment.
Another
benefit
that
comes
with
age
is
an
increased
vocabulary.
The
use
of
words
is
so
important
in
both
creative
and
critical
writing.
I
used
a
very
age
appropriate
vocabulary
for
NPostcards
for
HenryO.
It
is
very
apparent
to
the
reader
that
this
is
being
written
by
an
elementary
school
student.
If
I
were
to
write
that
story
now
with
the
same
plot,
my
more
mature
vocabulary
would
allow
me
to
create
a
more
fluid
line
of
thought,
as
well
as
expand
descriptions
to
be
more
vivid
for
the
reader.
I
would
never
want
to
re-write
this
piece
because
the
language
and
the
subject
mark
a
very
specific
time
in
my
childhood.
Just
as
people
have
photo
albums
and
home
videoOs,
I
have
a
piece
of
writing
that
clearly
defines
not
only
the
environment
I
created
for
the
character
but
also
defines
my
own
personal
environment.
Many
of
the
details
I
placed
in
the
story
were
from
aspects
of
my
life
at
the
time.
For
example,
one
of
the
postcards
that
the
character,
Henry,
reads
is
signed,
NWish
you
were
here,
Millie-KimO.
Now,
Millie-Kim
is
kind
of
a
creative
and
out-of-the-blue
name
for
a
third
grader
to
come
up
with.
To
a
reader,
it
may
just
seem
like
a
cute
anecdote.
However,
I
know
that
Millie-Kim
was
a
co-worker
of
my
mother
at
the
time
who
I
had
met
and
also
heard
my
mother
talk
about
at
home.
In
this
sense,
my
early
creative
writing
can
be
seen
as
somewhat
of
a
looking
glass
into
what
my
life
consisted
of
as
a
child.
One
of
the
drawbacks
to
becoming
more
mature
is
self-censorship.
Creative
writing
is
such
a
great
art
because
it
is
freeing
and
unconstrained,
unlike
critical
writing
that
is
most
of
the
time
a
very
tight
and
exact
art.
The
problem
with
growing
up
is
that
you
censor
your
own
writing.
Even
as
I
am
writing
this
essay,
I
am
both
actively
and
intuitively
editing
what
I
am
saying
based
upon
the
audience,
the
expected
appropriateness
of
the
writing,
as
well
as
the
constant
need
to
keep
the
audience
focused
and
interested
in
the
material.
This
is
a
skill
or
by-product
of
maturity
and
education.
In
my
early
years,
when
I
wrote
about
my
goldfish
or
when
I
created
the
character
of
Henry
the
mailman,
I
was
hardly
concerned
with
any
of
the
things
that
plague
my
writing
today.
I
did
not
care
about
how
NgoodO
it
sounded
to
the
reader,
or
who
the
reader
was
for
that
matter.
I
just
wrote
a
story
with
a
beginning,
a
middle,
an
end,
and
some
characters
and
that
was
it.
As
I
began
to
grow
out
of
this
elementary
school
state
of
mind,
creative
writing
became
harder
for
two
reasons.
One
it
became
less
and
less
common
for
a
teacher
in
junior
high
or
high
school
to
assign
you
a
creative
writing
piece
and
two,
my
self-censorship
had
taken
over
and
the
two
sides
of
my
brain
were
in
constant
competition
over
which
one
would
get
to
write
the
piece
for
me.
The
summer
between
7th
and
8th
grade,
I
attended
Kent
School
for
Creative
Writing.
At
this
point,
creative
writing
had
become
a
secondary
talent
to
my
5-paragraph
essay
writing,
but
my
mother
insisted
and
so
I
went.
This
is
the
period
of
time
in
my
life
when
I
realized
that
I
was
talented
at
creative
writing.
Even
despite
my
intense
self-censorship,
the
writing
I
produced
during
my
two
summers
at
this
camp
is
still
some
of
my
best.
What
inspired
this
writing
is
anyoneOs
guess.
The
teachers
at
this
particular
camp
were
the
closest
I
have
ever
come
to
true
connoisseurs
of
art,
in
general.
One
of
my
teachers
who
taught
my
afternoon
class
was
an
actress
who
wrote
her
own
one-woman
show
and
had
it
produced
in
Greenwich
Village,
she
played
every
instrument,
wrote
beautiful
poetry
that
combined
English
and
African
languages,
she
improvised
poetry
and
combined
it
with
movement
to
create
new
and
exciting
art
forms.
She
was
and
still
is
an
inspiration
to
everyone
she
meets.
My
morning
teacher
was
Arthur
MillerOs
personal
assistant
and
that
is
really
all
that
is
necessary
to
say
about
her.
A
genuine
artist
and
person,
she
cared
so
honestly
about
freeing
your
brain
of
the
conceptions
of
form
poetry
or
form
prose
and
pushed
us
to
create
whatever
felt
natural
to
us.
This
camp
was
one
of
my
first
experiences
in
showing
my
creative
writing
to
someone
other
than
my
mother.
Teachers,
of
course,
had
graded
some
of
my
poetry
or
prose
that
I
had
handed
in
for
an
assignment,
but
I
never
got
the
feeling
that
they
read
what
I
was
writing.
It
was
more
seeing
if
I
had
fit
the
criteria
and
not
reading
for
enjoyment
or
in
order
to
make
me
a
better
artist.
It
is
from
this
experience
at
camp
that
I
associate
Kent
School
with
a
very
open
and
inspiring
feeling.
Surrounded
by
the
Berkshires
and
right
on
the
Housotonic,
I
could
write
for
days.
It
is
here
at
Kent
that
I
began
to
understand
that
I
produce
two
kinds
of
writing.
The
first
kind
of
writing
I
produce
is
for
myself,
and
the
second
kind
is
for
others.
When
I
write
poetry,
I
usually
write
it
for
myself
and
use
it
as
therapy
to
release
feelings
and
emotions
that
I
do
not
want
stored
away.
When
I
am
writing
for
others,
I
usually
censor
myself
and
build
up
somewhat
of
a
superficial
writing
wall
that
protects
the
reader
from
seeing
my
personal
weaknesses
or
learning
too
much
about
me
as
a
person.
I
remember
two
instances
at
Kent
that
I
broke
free
from
these
constraints.
Both
of
these
experiences
happened
much
later
when
I
returned
to
Kent
as
a
teaching
assistant
during
my
college
summer
breaks.
My
first
year,
I
wrote
a
personal
essay
about
love.
The
topic
that
the
teacher
had
assigned
in
class
was
to
agree
or
disagree
with
the
statement
NIt
is
better
to
have
loved
and
lost
than
to
never
have
loved
at
allO.
I
had
just
recently
suffered
heartbreak
and
this
particular
essay
topic
was
a
sensitive
subject,
or
so
I
thought
at
the
time.
I
sat
in
my
room
with
my
laptop
and
brainstormed.
I
replayed
all
of
my
thoughts
about
how
much
I
had
suffered,
etc.
Being
a
teaching
assistant,
it
was
not
required
to
read
aloud
in
class
so
I
figured
I
would
just
write
whatever
came
to
me.
I
began
to
write
an
essay
disagreeing
with
the
statement.
I
made
it
a
little
personal
but
I
generally
tend
to
be
a
funny
writer
so
the
essay
still
contained
some
sarcastic,
bitter
remarks
that
I
love
to
use
in
my
writing.
The
next
day
in
class,
all
of
the
kids
had
read
and
the
teacher
turned
to
me
and
smiled,
NMiss
Jenkins,
you
havenOt
shared
anything
for
awhile,
why
donOt
you
go
ahead?O
The
teacher
had
broken
the
little
superficial
wall
I
had
built
in
order
to
protect
myself
from
these
middle
school
kids
knowing
too
much
about
my
life
outside
of
camp.
I
read
the
essay
aloud
and
kind
of
shuddered
when
I
came
to
the
Nanti-loveO
remarks.
I
was
teaching
this
kids
that
love
was
a
terrible
thing!
Once
I
was
finished,
the
class
laughed
and
I
looked
around.
The
teacher
looked
extremely
pleased,
NWhat
kind
of
techniques
did
Miss
use
in
her
writing
that
made
this
essay
exceptional?O
Exceptional?
That
word
had
never
been
used
to
describe
my
writing.
NGoodO
maybe,
NdetailedO
even
but
not
Nexceptional.O
I
felt
so
vulnerable
in
front
of
the
class
that
day
but
it
was
the
kind
of
vulnerability
that
made
me
a
stronger
writer
and
more
willing
to
share
my
work
with
others.
The
last
year
I
taught
at
Kent,
I
became
infatuated
with
Haiku
and
extended
Haiku
poems.
It
took
me
so
long
to
break
out
of
form
poetry
and
writing
but
now
that
I
understood
and
had
the
ability
to
do
free
write
poetry,
I
felt
that
a
return
to
form
poetry
would
be
interesting
and
more
educational
than
it
had
been
earlier
in
my
writing.
I
began
to
write
a
multiple
stanza
haiku
about
my
February
vacations
to
Paris
when
I
was
in
high
school.
I
used
ideas
I
had
gathered
from
some
of
the
teachers
and
combined
both
English
and
French
language
to
create
a
more
unique
haiku.
When
the
haiku
was
in
French,
I
wrote
about
my
mother.
I
had
gone
to
Paris
with
my
mother
and
I
felt
that
writing
haiku
about
her
and
my
favorite
parts
of
the
trip,
it
would
show
my
appreciation
for
her,
even
if
she
would
never
see
the
piece
of
writing.
I
wrote
about
how
beautiful
my
mother
was
and
how
I
wanted
to
thank
her
for
all
the
opportunities
she
had
given
me.
The
haiku
was
published
in
the
camp
literary
journal
and
I
took
a
copy
home
with
me.
My
mother,
later
that
summer,
stole
the
journal
from
my
room
and
read
the
poem
I
had
written.
I
was
kind
of
embarrassed
because
even
though
it
was
about
her
and
things
I
wanted
her
to
know,
I
felt
that
just
writing
it
was
enough
for
me
to
know
and
feel
that
she
was
appreciated.
My
mother
was
flattered
and
complimented
me,
NYou
really
know
how
to
make
your
mother
cry.O
These
two
experiences
have
helped
me
in
breaking
down
my
self-censorship
and
hesitancy
to
share
my
work
with
others.
Sharing
and
opening
yourself
and
your
writing
up
to
others
makes
you
a
better
writer,
hands
down.
Whether
it
is
simply
a
compliment
or
a
strong
critique
of
your
writing,
every
comment
helps
you
as
both
a
writer
and
a
person.
The
Writing
Associate
program
works
towards
this
goal
and
it
is
such
a
positive
resource
for
us
to
have
on
the
Lafayette
Campus.
Sharing
my
essays
with
my
WA
during
my
VAST
class
helped
me
so
much
as
an
essay
writer,
just
as
my
experiences
at
Kent
helped
me
as
a
creative
writer.
The
WA
program
is
a
benefit
to
the
campus
and
encourages
students
to
keep
writing
and
expanding
their
talent,
which
is
important
in
both
school
and
our
lives
in
general.
