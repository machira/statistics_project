A
Journey
Through
Writing
I
find
the
process
of
going
over
my
own
story
and
journey
through
writing
to
be
an
interesting
exercise.
It
is
not
very
often
that
I
decide
to
take
time
out
of
my
day
to
day
activities
and
consider
how
I
have
progressed
as
a
writer,
and
how
writing
has
truly
shaped
my
life.
Now
that
I
actually
have
stopped
and
spent
a
moment
of
reflection
I
am
amazed
to
see
what
an
influence
my
writing
ability
has
had
on
many
large
decisions
that
I
have
made.
My
writing
truly
is
an
integral
part
of
my
life.
My
first
recollection
of
writing
occurred
in
pre-school.
I
have
memories
of
spending
time
learning
my
letters
and
printing.
At
this
point
in
my
writing
career
I
was
not
creating
short
stories,
but
I
was
quite
proficient
at
reciting
that
alphabet.
As
I
entered
into
kindergarten
I
have
more
memories
of
those
wide
ruled
yellow
sheets
of
paper.
I
would
spend
large
amounts
of
time
copying
sentences
again
and
again.
When
I
entered
the
first
and
second
grade
I
was
no
longer
an
amateur,
or
so
I
thought.
I
wrote
my
first
book
during
one
of
these
years.
It
was
a
small
flipbook
that
discussed
space.
I
recall
having
been
so
proud
of
that
book.
I
just
recently
re-read
this
little
book
and
was
amazed
to
think
that
I
had
had
so
much
pride
in
it.
This
is
the
first
memory
that
I
have
of
a
piece
of
writing
though.
It
was
during
these
years
that
the
school
system
approached
my
mother.
Apparently
the
school
felt
that
my
handwriting
was
so
abysmal
that
I
should
just
stop
writing.
The
school
was
extremely
proud
of
its
new
laptops
and
they
intended
to
give
me
one
so
that
I
could
type
everything
as
apposed
to
writing
it.
My
mother
was
appalled
by
this
idea
and
refused.
I
continued
writing
with
my
number
two
Ticonderoga
pencil
just
as
all
the
other
students
were.
I
only
learned
of
this
discussion
a
few
years
ago,
and
at
that
point
I
just
found
it
to
be
amusing
and
I
took
no
offense
to
it.
In
fourth
grade
I
was
entered
into
the
advanced
spelling
group.
In
this
group
we
strove
to
improve
our
vocabulary,
and
to
enhance
our
spelling.
I
was
actually
not
very
good
at
spelling,
but
I
had
spoken
to
my
teacher
asking
if
I
could
be
placed
in
the
advanced
group.
He
was
impressed
with
my
motivation
so
he
bumped
me
into
that
level.
The
ironic
thing
is
that
I
was
actually
asking
to
be
placed
in
the
advanced
math
group,
but
he
had
misunderstood
me.
I
did
not
complain
though.
I
did
all
of
the
work
through
fourth
and
fifth
grade
and
I
succeeded.
At
the
end
of
fifth
grade
was
the
next
big
writing
assignment
that
I
remember.
It
was
a
project
that
was
called
me,
myself,
and
I.
It
was
overall
a
reflection
of
my
elementary
school
years.
It
included
such
sections
as
family
life,
your
dream
job,
favorite
memories.
I
remember
having
spent
hours
writing
that
book.
I
did
draft
after
draft,
just
to
throw
it
out
and
restart
because
I
decided
I
had
a
different
favorite
memory,
or
that
my
favorite
subject
was
actually
something
else.
I
got
off
on
a
very
good
start,
but
I
unfortunately
began
to
procrastinate
as
the
end
of
the
project
neared.
The
week
before
the
project
was
due
I
locked
myself
in
my
room
and
just
focused
on
finishing.
On
the
due
date
I
walked
to
school
with
such
pride.
My
work
was
complete
and
I
was
confident
in
what
I
had
done.
As
I
entered
the
classroom
all
the
other
children
had
ornately
decorated
binders,
I
merely
had
a
plain
blue
binder.
I
immediately
began
to
doubt
myself.
I
turned
in
my
work,
and
got
a
good
grade
on
the
project.
Self-doubt
did
continue
to
haunt
me
though.
This
project
is
not
what
caused
me
to
doubt
my
writing
ability.
It
was
most
likely
just
the
age
I
was
getting
to,
but
I
did
indeed
begin
to
doubt
myself.
This
is
an
issue
that
I
still
deal
with
in
my
writing,
and
it
was
around
the
end
of
fifth
grade
when
I
first
noticed
it.
Middle
school
was
enjoyable
to
me.
I
did
not
find
it
very
difficult,
but
I
liked
most
of
my
teachers.
My
seventh
grade
year
was
my
favorite
year
by
far
though.
I
believe
this
is
mainly
due
to
the
fact
that
I
had
one
of
my
favorite
teachers
during
that
academic
year.
Her
name
was
Ms.
Beam
and
she
was
my
English
teacher.
I
loved
getting
to
go
to
English.
We
were
required
to
keep
weekly
journals
of
our
lives.
I
regret
not
having
put
more
effort
into
these
journals
now,
but
I
enjoy
getting
to
go
back
and
see
what
I
was
doing
and
thinking
during
that
time
period.
It
was
also
that
year
that
I
began
to
get
into
poetry.
A
poet
came
in
to
my
class
to
run
a
workshop
with
us.
The
workshop
ran
for
about
a
week
and
I
loved
every
minute
of
it.
I
wrote
poems
that
mainly
dealt
with
the
wintertime
in
New
England.
I
had
just
read
Robert
FrostOs
poem
NStopping
by
the
Woods
on
a
Snowy
EveningO.
I
became
obsessed
with
my
attempts
to
capture
the
utter
peacefulness
that
I
experience
while
walking
through
the
snow
onto
paper
in
the
form
of
poetry.
I
was
so
proud
to
get
all
of
my
poems
back
with
excellent
or
great
scrawled
across
the
front
of
them.
I
was
exposed
to
many
forms
of
poetry
in
Ms.
BeamOs
class.
I
chose
a
poem
titled
N
The
hippopotamusO
to
analyze
and
write
a
paper
on.
I
unfortunately
forget
what
analysis
I
provided
for
that
poem
though.
One
piece
of
poetry
that
I
will
never
forget
was
William
ShakespeareOs
monologue
in
Henry
V
titled
the
NSt.
CrispenOs
day
SpeechO.
I
found
it
to
be
one
of
the
most
rousing
pieces
of
writing
that
I
have
ever
read.
To
this
day
whenever
I
need
to
get
excited
to
write,
or
in
general
I
begin
to
quote
that
speech.
It
has
a
lot
of
significance
to
me.
Kim
Beam
really
shaped
the
way
that
I
looked
at
the
subject
of
English.
She
was
the
first
person
that
began
to
truly
shape
my
writing.
I
admire
her
greatly,
and
she
was
actually
at
my
house
last
week
paying
a
visit
to
catch
up.
She
has
become
a
close
friend
of
mine,
and
it
is
in
part
due
to
her
that
I
am
the
writer
that
I
am
today.
In
eighth
grade
I
did
not
enjoy
English
nearly
as
much
as
I
had
through
seventh
grade,
and
my
previous
passion
for
poetry
began
to
fade.
I
did
write
one
large
research
paper
that
I
was
proud
of
though.
I
read
the
biography
of
the
scientist
Charles
Steinmtez,
and
I
wrote
a
report
on
his
life.
My
writing
was
very
thorough,
and
I
thought
well
organized.
Looking
back
now
I
see
that
I
had
a
lot
of
progress
ahead
of
me.
That
is
the
fantastic
thing
about
writing.
A
person
never
reaches
the
point
where
they
can
comfortably
say
that
their
writing
needs
to
progress
no
farther.
No
person
can
claim
to
be
the
perfect
writer.
In
my
opinion
writing
is
a
constant
journey
which
leads
to
more
and
more
satisfaction
the
more
you
pursue
it.
That
is
what
high
school
was
for
me.
It
was
a
lot
of
traveling
down
that
road
to
better
writing.
I
attended
an
extremely
rigorous
preparatory
school
called
St.
JohnOs
Prep.
My
first
year
I
was
immediately
exposed
to
literary
works
such
as
Of
mice
and
men,
Lost
Horizon,
and
To
Kill
a
Mockingbird.
Again
I
began
to
enjoy
English.
I
even
began
to
write
poetry
again.
I
really
enjoyed
my
teacher.
I
found
him
to
be
energetic
and
passionate
about
English.
A
good
teacher
makes
a
large
difference
to
how
much
can
be
obtained
from
a
class.
In
conjunction
with
the
writing
I
was
doing
in
English,
I
found
that
I
was
doing
a
lot
more
writing
for
History.
My
Sophmore
year
I
was
in
Mr.
D.
SmithOs
class.
He
was
known
for
being
an
extremely
difficult
teacher
who
would
turn
average
writers
into
good
writers.
His
goal
was
to
train
his
students
to
group
similar
historical
topics
together
with
a
main
idea.
This
is
more
difficult
than
it
may
seem.
I
had
to
develop
a
keen
eye
in
order
to
see
how
certain
subject
matters
that
were
apparently
unrelated
could
be
compared
with
one
another.
Over
the
course
of
that
year
I
wrote
a
large
research
paper
on
the
Life
of
Toussaint
LOOuverture,
the
leader
of
the
Haitian
rebellion.
As
I
was
writing
this
paper
I
began
to
see
a
large
difference
in
my
academic
writing.
My
thoughts
were
more
organized,
and
I
was
able
to
describe
things
in
much
clearer
and
more
concise
fashion
than
I
had
previously
been
able
to.
It
was
at
this
point
that
I
began
to
love
writing
papers
for
history
class.
I
loved
the
academic
nature
of
it,
and
I
love
getting
to
blend
my
own
analysis
with
the
facts
and
information
that
I
had
researched.
I
began
to
look
for
opportunities
to
do
more
historical
writing.
In
my
Junior
year
I
had
to
write
a
research
paper
for
English.
I
decided
that
I
was
going
to
combine
two
of
my
favorite
subjects
for
the
paper.
I
wanted
to
combine
history
and
music
together.
The
final
topic
that
I
settled
on
was
an
analysis
of
the
juxtaposition
between
classical
and
jazz
music
present
in
The
Great
Gatsby
and
itOs
overall
effect
on
the
book.
In
order
to
complete
this
paper
it
required
that
I
do
a
lot
of
research
about
the
presence
of
classical
music
and
jazz
music
in
the
1920Os.
I
found
the
work
to
be
fascinating.
I
truly
enjoyed
writing
the
paper,
and
I
felt
that
I
got
a
lot
out
of
it.
At
the
same
time
I
was
doing
quite
a
lot
of
writing
for
my
history
class
as
well.
I
was
studying
early
American
history
and
I
had
to
do
a
good
amount
of
writing
dealing
with
the
formation
of
the
nationOs
government,
political
ideals,
the
Revolution
in
general,
and
many
other
various
subjects.
I
continued
to
enjoy
writing
for
history,
but
I
still
doubted
my
writing
as
I
had
previously
mentioned.
During
my
senior
year
I
decided
that
I
wanted
to
double
major
in
History
and
Archaeology
in
college.
I
therefore
began
to
put
more
effort
into
my
history
course.
I
was
writing
a
lot
of
Document
Based
Questions,
and
various
papers
of
that
sort,
but
nothing
that
I
truly
enjoyed.
At
the
end
of
the
year
I
spoke
to
my
teacher
and
asked
him
if
he
thought
that
it
was
a
good
choice
for
me
to
major
in
history.
He
informed
me
that
he
thought
that
my
writing
was
a
little
weak.
I
was
slightly
surprised
by
this
response
for
previously
in
the
year
I
had
brought
one
of
my
college
essayOs
to
my
English
teacher
to
proof.
He
informed
me
that
my
essay
was
one
the
best
written
and
most
moving
essays
that
he
had
read.
I
did
not
argue
my
history
teacherOs
point
though,
instead
I
graciously
accepted
the
advice
and
walked
away.
As
I
walked
away
from
that
conversation
I
made
a
goal
for
myself.
I
decided
that
I
would
work
much
harder
to
improve
my
writing
skills,
and
that
I
would
give
my
complete
and
total
best
on
every
paper
that
I
wrote
from
that
point
onward.
When
I
arrived
at
college
I
felt
very
well
prepared,
but
I
had
doubts
about
how
my
writing
style
would
be
received.
My
doubts
were
soon
laid
to
rest
for
all
of
my
professors
seemed
to
like
my
writing.
I
was
so
relieved.
I
was
getting
very
positive
feedback,
and
I
really
enjoyed
writing
for
all
of
my
courses.
I
was
able
to
put
much
more
of
myself
into
my
work
because
I
had
more
time
at
my
disposal,
and
because
I
was
more
interested
in
the
subject
material.
I
was
ecstatic
to
realize
that
I
indeed
was
a
strong
writer,
and
that
my
high
school
teacher
may
have
been
mistaken
about
my
writing
capabilities.
I
enjoy
getting
to
write
in
college
very
much.
My
freshman
year
many
people
on
my
dorm
floor
would
bring
their
papers
to
me
and
I
would
edit
them.
I
enjoyed
getting
to
do
that
as
well.
I
found
that
the
more
papers
I
read,
the
more
I
learned
about
my
own
writing
style.
This
helped
me
to
progress
even
more.
I
then
took
an
anthropology
course
second
semester.
I
found
the
material
covered
in
the
class
to
be
amazingly
interesting.
I
spent
weeks
writing
my
first
research
paper
for
the
class,
and
though
I
was
extremely
nervous
handing
it
in,
I
was
also
extremely
proud.
I
had
good
reasons
to
be
nervous
for
the
book
that
I
had
been
reviewing
was
actually
written
by
my
professor.
When
I
received
it
back
I
was
extremely
pleased
to
see
that
I
had
gotten
a
good
mark.
It
was
at
this
point
that
I
became
truly
confident
in
my
writing.
No
longer
did
I
feel
like
I
was
merely
pretending
to
be
a
writer,
I
realized
that
I
was
a
good
writer.
My
writing
is
very
important
to
me.
I
want
to
pursue
a
career
in
academia
and
in
order
to
do
so
I
must
be
a
very
strong
writer.
I
now
know
that
I
am
a
solid
writer
but
I
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do.
My
journey
down
the
road
to
better
writing
is
truly
just
starting.
I
am
excited
to
begin
working
as
a
WA
so
that
I
am
not
only
able
to
help
other
people
improve
their
writing,
but
so
my
own
writing
can
improve.
My
journey
so
far
has
been
a
good
one.
I
am
excited
to
see
all
that
I
can
learn
about
writing,
and
about
myself
through
my
writing
in
the
years
to
come.
