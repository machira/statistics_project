Literacy
Narrative
As
a
child,
if
someone
had
told
me
I
was
going
to
graduate
from
college
as
an
English
major,
I
think
I
would
have
laughed.
I
was
going
to
study
math,
stick
with
numbers,
and
be
an
accountant
like
my
mother.
I
hated
writing;
book
reports
were
the
bane
of
my
early
existence.
Now,
as
a
college
senior
who
hopes
one
day
to
be
a
book
editor,
I
can
fully
appreciate
the
irony
of
my
childish
distaste
for
writing.
I
have
not
had
a
math
class
since
the
eleventh
grade
and
never
in
my
life
have
I
taken
a
single
business
course.
Looking
back
on
my
life
thus
far,
itus
funny
to
see
how
I
have
changed
and
what
factors
have
influenced
my
development.
In
spite
of
my
resistance
to
writing
book
reports,
one
thing
that
was
as
true
then
as
it
is
now,
is
that
I
love
to
read.
I
always
have
and
probably
always
will.
In
pre-school,
my
mother,
at
my
insistence,
requested
permission
for
me
to
read,
instead
of
sleep,
during
rnap-times.
My
parents
would
open
the
door
to
my
room
at
night,
after
they
had
put
me
to
bed,
only
to
find
me
with
a
flashlight,
reading
under
the
covers.
In
sixth
grade,
my
friends
would
take
my
books
away
from
me
during
recess
and
drag
me
outside.
My
chronic
problem
with
book
reports,
then,
did
not
stem
from
any
aversion
to
reading;
it
was
the
writing
over
which
I
agonized.
Book
reports
are
the
first
type
of
paper
I
remember
being
asked
to
write.
As
a
fifth
grader,
two
pages
seemed
endless.
Throughout
elementary
school
and
even
into
middle
school,
teachers
made
the
same
kind
of
notes
on
the
bottom
of
my
papers,
comments
to
the
effect:
rWhat
you
have
is
good,
but
you
need
to
write
more.s
It
is
true
that
my
writing
was
concise;
after
all,
why
use
a
whole
paragraph
to
explain
something
which
could
be
expressed
in
a
single
sentence?
This
logic
to
an
extent
sticks
with
me
even
today;
although
I
no
longer
struggle
to
write
longer
assignments,
I
try
to
avoid
repetitive
writing
and
unnecessary
wordiness.
In
a
book
report,
I
had
no
desire
to
reiterate
everything
the
author
said;
I
thought
if
anyone
wanted
to
know
what
the
book
was
about,
he
or
she
should
just
read
the
book,
get
the
story
straight
from
the
author
and
draw
his
or
her
own
conclusions.
I
did
not
learn
the
value
of
book
reports
until
middle
school,
when
we
did
a
project
in
which
each
of
us
read
a
different
book,
made
a
poster
and
presented
our
reports
to
the
class
that
I
realized
that
those
papers
could
entice
others
to
read
a
particular
book
or
turn
off
potential
readers
from
ever
lifting
the
cover.
Even
then,
I
did
not
really
understand
that
what
I
learned
from
a
book
and
what
someone
else
picked
up
from
the
same
book
might
be
completely
different
and
that
by
sharing
our
observations
or
debating
conflicting
opinions
we
might
both
learn
something
new.
As
a
child,
writing
was
a
chore
over
which
I
labored
intently,
writing
in
my
black-bound
rcomposition
notebook.s
I
scribbled
wobbly
letters
with
my
favorite
mechanical
pencil,
only
to
painstakingly
erase
them
when
I
changed
my
mind
about
what
I
wanted
to
say.
My
mom
proofread
all
of
my
assignments
in
those
days,
making
note
of
all
her
suggested,
and
by
suggested,
I
mean
obligatory,
changes
lightly
in
pencil,
so
her
corrections
could
be
erased
as
if
they
were
never
written.
She
was
far
more
difficult
to
please
than
any
of
my
elementary
school
teachers.
I
stopped
giving
her
my
papers
to
read
in
the
sixth
grade,
but
it
wasnut
until
tenth
grade
that
I
had
a
teacher
who
challenged
my
writing
as
much
as
she
did.
My
first
assignment
from
Mrs.
McLaughlin,
my
English
teacher
sophomore
year
of
high
school,
was
to
write
ten
journal
entries
on
varied
topics
related
to
our
summer
reading,
which
incidentally
was
comprised
of
Aldous
Huxleyus
Brave
New
World,
and
Fyodor
Dostoyevskyus
Crime
and
Punishment,
over
vacation,
to
be
handed
in
on
the
first
day
of
school.
The
whole
class
completed
the
assignment
in
typical,
lazy,
summer
fashion,
as
we
assumed
expectations
would
be
fairly
low
for
a
paper
written
during
our
break.
I
received
a
serious
reality
check
the
next
day,
when
I
casually
flipped
through
my
notebook
to
the
last
page,
and
nearly
cried
when
I
saw
the
grade-
a
79?
Even
more
appalling-
it
was
the
highest
grade
in
the
class!
Right
then
and
there
I
envisioned
the
devastation
of
my
GPA
and
destruction
of
my
college
dreams.
Contrary
to
my
melodramatic
expectations,
instead
of
ruining
my
future
plans
for
college,
it
was
Mrs.
McLaughlin
who
prepared
me
for
college-level
writing.
Over
the
course
of
the
year,
she
was
determined
to
teach
me
and
my
classmates
to
become
better
writers.
She
forced
us
to
experiment
with
different
types
of
writing,
to
write
from
perspectives
with
which
we
did
not
necessarily
agree,
to
edit
our
own
work
as
well
as
that
of
our
classmates,
and
to
cut
out
unnecessary
and
unclear
rfiller
materials
we
used
when
we
ran
out
of
things
to
say
in
our
papers.
I
learned
to
enjoy
writing
in
her
class;
it
became
a
challenge
to
try
and
write
a
rperfects
paper,
to
receive
as
few
corrections
as
humanly
possible.
I
began
to
think
before
I
wrote
a
single
word,
always
trying
to
make
my
sentences
clearer,
and
use
the
word
that
most
exactly
conveyed
my
meaning,
even
if
it
meant
pulling
out
a
dictionary
or
flipping
through
a
thesaurus.
I
never
did
manage
a
flawless
paper,
but
I
did
receive
some
of
the
hardest-earned
rAss
of
my
life.
Then
as
a
senior,
Mrs.
McLaughlin
re-appeared
on
the
scene,
this
time
as
the
Advanced
Placement
English
Literature
teacher.
In
addition
to
the
wide
range
of
classics
I
read
for
the
course,
Mrs.
McLaughlin
helped
me
write
the
first
real
research
paper
of
my
academic
career.
In
the
past,
other
assignments
had
been
given
that
designation,
but
this
paper,
a
whopping
12
pages
in
length,
intended
as
a
cross-course
task
in
conjunction
with
the
AP
European
History
class
many
of
us
were
taking
simultaneously,
marked
a
serious
step,
or
rather
leap,
in
my
writing
experience.
I
had
to
combine
elements
of
Shakespeareus
King
Lear
with
the
historical
context
of
the
period,
provided
by
my
history
class,
in
a
gargantuan
(in
my
opinion
at
the
time)
paper,
which
required
hours
of
outside
research.
At
the
time,
I
didnut
think
Iud
survive
the
assignment,
but
I
now
know
that
paper
laid
the
foundation
for
writing
at
a
collegiate
level.
As
part
of
our
preparation
for
both
the
AP
Exam
and
college
writing,
in
addition
the
research
paper,
I
mainly
recall
sitting
in
class,
writing
practice
essays
for
the
test.
I
was
almost
as
worried
about
the
practice
tests
as
the
AP
Exam
itself.
Mrs.
McLaughlin
tried
to
simulate
the
environment
in
which
we
would
take
the
AP
exam
with
strict
classroom
discipline
and
inflexible
time
constraints,
while
we
alternately
scribbled
as
quickly
as
we
could
and
frantically
chewed
our
number
two
pencils
in
thought.
One
of
those
practice
essays
is
still
among
my
favorite
papers
Iuve
ever
had
to
write,
made
all
the
better
the
r49/50s
scrawled
by
Mrs.
McLaughlin
at
the
bottom.
I
know
she
deserves
the
five
I
received
on
that
AP
Exam
more
than
I
do,
but
more
importantly,
she
encouraged
me
to
study
English,
to
learn
to
enjoy
writing,
and
to
see
a
poor
grade
as
a
reason
to
persevere,
not
give
up.
Without
these
high
school
experiences,
I
think
I
would
have
been
lost
as
a
freshman
at
Lafayette
College.
As
it
was,
I
was
nervous
about
my
first
college
level
writing
courses.
Fall
semester,
I
took
a
Freshman
Year
Seminar,
of
course,
as
well
as
an
English
course
called
Literary
Questions.
In
Literary
Questions,
I
was
put
at
ease
almost
immediately
by
the
syllabus,
which
contained
books
of
a
variety
of
literary
genres,
and
the
assignments,
which
included
weekly
two
page
papers
and
two
larger
projects
over
the
course
of
the
semester.
After
writing
two
or
three
short
papers,
I
discovered
the
expectations
were
not
terribly
different
from
those
of
my
AP
course
the
year
before.
The
next
semester,
when
I
took
my
first
300-level
English
class,
rThe
Romanticss
I
discovered
the
value
of
incorporating
knowledge
I
had
from
other
classes
into
my
assignments,
of
applying
information
learned
elsewhere,
to
write
a
more
informed
paper.
For
example,
I
attended
a
Christian
high
school
and
when
I
entered
a
secular
university,
I
assumed
my
previous
religion
classes
would
not
provide
much
in
the
way
of
academic
advantages.
However,
I
soon
learned
to
use
my
background
in
Biblical
knowledge
to
better
understand
the
allusions
in
many
of
the
texts
we
read
from
the
Romantic
Period
(especially
when
we
read
William
Blake).
The
more
classes
I
took,
the
more
significant
the
ability
to
apply
the
things
I
had
learned
in
other
areas
seemed
to
be.
I
had
a
bit
more
trouble
trying
to
figure
out
the
Freshman
Year
Seminar.
One
of
the
topics
perhaps
not
covered
adequately
in
my
education
prior
to
that
point
was
free-writing.
I
had
not
been
allowed
to
use
the
word
rIs
in
an
assignment
for
years,
and
I
was
at
a
loss
as
to
how
to
begin
again.
When
I
write
a
paper
on
a
book,
I
can
hide
behind
the
author
and
take
advantage
of
the
relative
anonymity
and
assumed
objectivity
of
a
faceless
informed
reader.
If
asked
to
write
about
myself,
I
start
to
tense
up
as
I
try
to
decide
what
I
could
write
about
myself
that
might
be
of
interest
to
the
reader.
Creative
writing
assignments,
like
this
one,
are
in
fact
still
the
type
of
writing
with
which
I
am
least
comfortable.
I
have
long
since
grown
accustomed
to
the
formerly
despised
rbook
reportss
and
their
higher-level
equivalents,
critical
essays,
even
to
lengthy
arguments
and
in-depth
research
papers,
but
still,
writing
a
journal
entry,
basic
though
it
seems,
presents
me
with
problems.
How
does
one
decide
on
a
tone?
A
journal
is
meant
to
be
informal,
but
one
doesnut
want
to
be
too
informal
with
oneus
teacher.
On
the
other
hand,
few
things
are
as
boring
as
an
overly
formal
journal
entry,
because
formality
limits
what
can
be
said,
what
kind
of
anecdotes
can
be
included;
in
short,
all
the
interesting
parts.
I
am
often
left
wondering
which
parts
of
my
story
are
vital
and
which
are
better
left
out.
The
only
writing
of
this
kind
that
I
remember
doing
in
all
of
high
school
was
in
a
religion
class,
when
we
were
asked
to
write
an
in-class
essay
on
how
we
defined
ourselves.
I
remember
feeling
foolish,
looking
at
my
paper,
and
thinking
that
a
first-grader
could
have
written
it,
as
it
began
rMy
name
is
i
and
I
am
14
years
oldis
Luckily
for
me,
my
teacher
graded
the
assignment
largely
on
content,
not
style.
I
recall
thinking
that
if
he
had
asked
me
to
write
about
my
favorite
character
from
a
book,
or
even
the
person
next
to
me,
I
could
have
written
a
much
more
satisfactory
paper,
something
that
strikes
me
now
as
rather
backwards.
While
my
rcreative
writings
has
come
a
long
way
from
that
time,
I
still
seek
to
improve
that
aspect
of
my
writing.
As
they
say,
practice
makes
perfect,
so
I
guess
the
only
way
to
improve
is
to
keep
writing.
I
hope
that
I
may
improve
in
this
area
through
Lafayetteus
College
Writing
Program,
in
the
VAST
course
that
I
will
take
in
the
spring,
and
perhaps
even
in
some
of
my
English
classes.
If
I
have
learned
anything
in
my
experience
thus
far
as
a
student,
it
is
the
value,
and
indeed,
the
necessity
of
working
on
areas
with
which
I
struggle,
whether
that
area
is
a
form
of
writing,
or
another
subject,
or
something
unrelated
to
the
classroom,
a
hobby
or
sport
(in
my
case,
swimming),
and
of
trying
again
and
again,
until
I
get
it
right.
I
would
like
to
help
others
realize
their
potential
in
their
writing
as
college
students.
I
personally
have
come
a
long
way
from
the
stubborn
little
kid
who
hated
writing.
As
an
English
and
Spanish
double
major,
a
graduating
senior,
contemplating
graduate
school
and
working
as
a
Writing
Associate
in
college,
I
remember
the
days
when
rLanguage
Artss
was
my
least
favorite
subject
with
amusement.
I
once
considered
three
simple
sentences
an
appropriate
length
paragraph,
when
now
I
sometimes
struggle
to
limit
myself
to
three
pages
when
writing
an
essay.
I
hope
that
as
a
writing
associate
I
can
help
other
students
to
realize
that
even
if
they
dislike
writing,
even
if
they
do
not
believe
they
are
talented
writers,
with
a
little
bit
of
encouragement
and
a
lot
of
effort,
they
can
become
better
writers
and
may
even
find
that
they
enjoy
writing,
after
all.
