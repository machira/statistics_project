I
first
began
writing
when
I
was
five.
I
can
see
myself
sitting
on
a
swing
in
my
backyard
writing
the
lyrics
to
my
sure-to-be
number
one
hits
in
my
Lisa
Drank
diary.
After
completing
what
I
considered
my
masterpiece,
I
would
lock
the
diary
and
hide
it
in
my
Nvery
secretO
hiding
place
in
my
dresser.
Writing
began
as
a
very
personal
experience;
I
wrote
alone,
I
hid
my
works
for
others,
and
I
never
told
anyone
what
I
had
written
or
that
I
had
written
anything
at
all.
This
remains
true
for
my
creative
writing
even
today.
In
first
grade
I
did
feel
comfortable
letting
others
see
my
writing,
though.
We
were
required
to
keep
a
journal
in
a
marble
notebook.
This
journal
was
simply
a
short
response,
three
to
five
sentences
in
messy
six-year-old
handwriting,
to
questions
such
as
NWhat
did
you
do
this
weekend?O
and
NWhat
us
your
favorite
animal?O
These
responses
were
also
accompanied
by
small,
equally
messy
drawings.
Though
only
a
few
sentences,
this
journal
helped
teach
me
simple
grammar
and
spelling.
It
also
made
me
more
comfortable
with
criticism
from
a
teacher.
The
combination
of
writing
and
drawing
undoubtedly
helped
make
a
connection
between
the
words
and
the
images
to
help
me
better
understand
the
English
language.
Throughout
elementary
school,
journals
such
as
this
were
assigned,
though
they
increased
in
the
complexity
of
the
questions
asked
and
the
responses
required.
This
gave
me
even
more
experience
in
the
world
of
personal
and
informative
writing
and
helped
hone
my
writing
skills
with
continued
editing
from
teachers
and
aides.
Other
forms
of
writing
were
also
introduced
in
elementary
school.
In
second
grade,
I
was
required
to
do
a
project
on
any
animal
that
included
a
short
paper
and
a
diorama.
Like
the
first
grade
journal,
visual
art
was
again
combined
with
writing
to
further
the
connection
between
the
words
themselves
and
what
they
represented.
The
diorama
here
also
helped
my
peers
and
me
present
the
information
we
gathered
to
others.
This
short
research
paper
was
the
first
of
many
I
was
assigned
throughout
elementary
school.
Each
project,
like
each
journal,
was
accompanied
by
a
visual
aid
and
increased
in
complexity
and
continued
to
help
me
develop
my
writing
style
and
skill.
The
project
was
often
accompanied
by
a
list
of
questions
or
a
set
of
bullet
points
including
information
required
in
the
paper.
These
points
helped
shape
the
organization
of
the
paper,
which
helped
for
future
papers
where
such
aid
was
not
given.
Alongside
these
informative
research
papers,
in
third
grade
I
was
introduced
to
document-based
essays.
Here,
a
story
was
read
aloud
or
a
short
essay
was
presented
and
followed
by
a
set
of
questions
or
an
essay
question
based
on
the
reading.
Unlike
the
research
paper,
the
document-based
essay
required
me
to
analyze
given
information
and
use
that
information
to
answer
a
specific
question.
This
was
very
different
from
the
research
paper,
where
I
was
required
to
find
the
information
on
my
own
and
could
decide
what
information
to
use.
The
document-based
essay,
though,
was
less
structured
than
the
research
paper,
which
gave
an
outline
as
to
how
to
organize
the
paper.
Document-based
essays
continued
to
be
an
important
writing
style
well
into
middle
and
high
school.
While
writing
research
papers,
creating
visual
aids,
and
answering
document-based
essay
questions,
I
kept
up
my
personal
writing
as
well.
As
in
my
days
on
the
swing,
I
continued
to
write
alone
in
notebooks
and
continued
to
keep
my
writing
private.
I
switched
from
songs
to
poems
and
also
began
to
keep
a
diary.
Writing
continued
to
serve
as
a
leisurely
activity
as
well
as
a
way
to
release
inner
emotions
in
a
private
atmosphere,
free
from
the
criticism
and
judgment
of
teachers
and
family.
I
also
continued
to
hide
my
notebooks
in
their
Nvery
secretO
spot
in
my
dresser
to
make
my
writing
even
more
private.
In
middle
school,
most
writing
forms
form
elementary
school
continued
-
research
papers
and
document-based
essays.
As
expected,
the
writing
I
was
asked
to
do
in
class
continued
to
become
more
complex.
Research
papers
required
more
in-depth
research
and
more
independence
in
regards
to
organization
and
choice
of
information
included.
Document-based
essays
now
provided
more
documents
and
often
included
visual
documents,
such
as
graphs
and
pictures.
I
was
now
required
to
connect
the
written
word
in
the
form
of
stories,
poems,
and
articles
with
visual
imagery.
Middle
school
also
introduced
me
to
even
more
forms
of
writing.
I
was
now
asked
to
write
literature-based
essays
in
my
English
classes.
These
essays
focused
on
specific
aspects
of
the
works
we
read
and
discussed
in
class
such
as
characterization,
plot,
and
other
simple
literary
elements.
Though
seemingly
simple,
this
primed
me
for
future
literature-based
essays
in
high
school
that
required
more
literary
elements.
I
was
also
required
to
write
in
classes
I
was
not
expecting
to
-
math
and
science.
Here
I
was
asked
to
explain
how
I
got
answers
to
previous
questions
that
required
formulas
and
the
principles
or
theorems
that
supported
my
answers.
Instead
of
analyzing
and
presenting
other
writing,
I
was
explaining
numbers
in
an
informative
way.
This
type
of
writing
was
very
different
than
any
I
had
done
before.
It
was
much
more
technical
and
much
less
creative
than
other
forms
of
writing
and
helped
expand
my
writing
experience
immensely.
This
technical
writing
as
well
as
the
literature
based
essays,
document-based
essays,
and
research
papers
all
followed
me
into
high
school.
It
was
during
high
school
that
I
began
to
write
many
of
my
papers
at
home
using
a
computer.
This
was
very
different
than
writing
in
class,
where
time
constraints
and
the
classroom
setting
made
for
stressful
writing
environments
and
led
to
rushed
papers
that
lacked
organized
thought.
At
home,
I
could
edit
my
work
as
I
wrote
on
the
computer
and
take
all
the
time
I
wanted
to
create
more
thought-out
papers
for
every
class.
There
were
many
more
distractions
when
writing
at
home,
however,
so
more
focus
was
necessary
to
complete
papers.
The
writing
I
did
in
high
school,
though,
was
very
formulaic.
During
the
first
two
years
of
high
school
every
class
was
preparing
for
the
New
York
State
Regents,
a
series
of
tests
created
by
the
state
that
each
student
must
pass
in
each
subject
in
order
to
graduate.
As
a
result,
most
classes
were
geared
toward
passing
the
Regents
in
that
subject.
This
meant
that
the
writing
required
by
each
class
was
also
guided
by
the
RegentsO
handbook.
As
a
result,
most
teachers
graded
by
the
RegentsO
standards.
To
guide
students
to
pass,
these
teachers
developed
a
series
of
steps
to
be
followed
when
writing
in
each
style
that
conformed
with
the
Regents
in
that
subject.
While
it
left
little
room
for
creativity,
this
method
did
help
me
pass
each
Regents.
It
also
created
a
strong
stepping
stone
for
future
writing.
In
the
future,
I
expanded
on
the
steps
given
to
me
by
past
teachers
to
write
more
creative,
college-level
papers.
The
expansion
on
these
formulaic
papers
was
made
in
my
junior
year
during
my
AP
Language
class.
In
this
class,
I
learned
the
importance
of
syntax,
grammar,
and
word
choice
when
reading
and
writing
in
every
style.
This
class
honed
my
use
of
the
English
language
in
essay
writing.
Though
in
class
this
was
used
typically
in
argumentative
or
literature
based
essays,
the
skills
I
gained
applied
to
all
types
of
writing.
The
next
year,
my
AP
Literature
class
further
developed
my
individual
writing
style.
Here,
I
wrote
literature-based
essays
regarding
authorsO
intentions.
In
this
class,
I
was
able
to
apply
all
of
the
knowledge
gained
throughout
my
education
to
a
topic
I
loved
to
write
about
and
planned
on
studying
for
the
next
four
years.
In
both
of
these
classes,
I
had
to
face
harsh
criticism
from
my
teachers.
Both
teachers
often
criticized
my
lack
of
transitions
and
inclusion
of
unnecessary
information.
Although
it
took
time,
I
worked
on
fixing
these
problems
and
by
the
end
of
my
senior
year,
I
produced
multiple
papers
that
I
was
extremely
proud
of
-
free
of
the
problems
that
had
plagues
my
writing
before.
I
now
felt
that
I
had
truly
grasped
college-level
writing:
I
was
able
to
analyze
and
interpret
literary
works
and
write
informative
papers
that
successfully
presented
my
analysis
in
a
clear,
concise
way.
I
was
now
prepared
enough
by
my
high
school
courses
to
take
on
writing
courses
in
Lafayette.
Throughout
middle
and
high
school,
I
still
maintained
a
journal
of
personal
creative
writing.
My
personal
writing
became
even
more
personal
as
the
confusion
and
anxiety
of
my
teenage
years
weighed
on
me.
This
was
a
turning
point
for
my
creative
writing
as
it
began
to
take
on
the
function
of
an
emotional
outlet
rather
than
a
way
to
pass
the
time.
I
stopped
keeping
a
diary
as
my
poems,
short
stories,
and
prose
served
the
same
purpose
as
one.
The
many
writing
styles
I
was
introduced
to
in
middle
and
high
school
as
well
as
the
skills
I
learned
through
them
greatly
impacted
my
writing.
It
gave
my
words
more
meaning
and
helped
me
develop
my
own
personal
style
of
writing.
I
truly
feel
that
my
writing
has
grown
over
the
years.
I
have
still
kept
my
old
habits
though;
I
write
alone,
and
I
write
for
myself.
It
is
my
safe
haven,
and
I
will
continue
to
regard
it
as
such.
Feeling
prepared,
I
looked
forward
to
writing
my
first
English
paper
at
Lafayette.
It
was
in
my
first
English
class
that
I
had
both
my
best
and
worst
writing
experiences.
My
worst
writing
experience
occurred
when
I
received
a
B
on
my
first
paper.
I
thought
that
I
was
more
than
prepared
for
college-level
writing
and
was
expecting
higher
grades
than
Bs.
Unfortunately,
I
received
Bs
on
the
first
four
of
ten
short
papers
for
the
semester,
as
well
as
on
the
first
five
page
paper.
After
meeting
with
the
professor
multiple
times,
I
came
to
understand
that
a
B
is
a
gift
-
it
allows
for
room
to
grow.
I
went
over
the
papers
I
had
written
thus
far
and
noted
both
my
strengths
and
my
weaknesses.
I
realized
that
in
high
school,
generalizations
were
necessary
for
AP
tests
due
to
time
restrictions.
In
college,
there
were
no
time
restrictions,
so
there
was
no
reason
to
be
so
general.
In
college,
it
was
more
important
to
focus
on
specific
points,
which
ultimately
leads
to
greater
insight
on
the
work
itself.
On
the
fifth
paper,
I
did
just
that.
I
focused
on
a
specific
aspect
of
the
work
I
was
studying
and,
in
doing
so,
finally
received
the
A
I
had
been
searching
for
all
semester.
Although
the
rest
of
my
papers
were
not
all
As,
they
were
all
significant
improvements
over
the
first
four.
My
best
writing
experience
came
at
the
end
of
my
first
semester.
After
a
rough
start,
followed
by
papers
going
from
A
to
B
and
back
again,
it
was
time
for
the
final
ten
page
paper.
I
focused
all
of
my
energy
on
this
paper
and
would
not
settle
for
anything
less
than
an
A.
I
wrote
a
thorough
rough
draft
and
met
with
the
professor,
who
advised
me
to
be
even
more
specific.
With
this
in
mind,
I
did
just
that
and
again
focused
on
the
paper
at
hand.
On
the
last
day
of
class,
I
handed
in
the
final
copy,
proud
of
the
work
that
I
had
done
and
the
effort
I
had
put
into
it.
At
that
point,
the
grade
meant
close
to
nothing
to
me.
I
knew
that,
regardless
of
the
grade,
I
had
absolutely
learned
how
to
be
a
better
writer,
how
to
convey
my
ideas
in
a
more
sophisticated
manner,
and
how
to
focus
on
even
more
specific
aspects
of
literary
works.
The
grade
did
still
mean
something,
of
course,
and
I
was
ecstatic
when
I
discovered
that
I
received
an
A.
The
transformation
I
had
made
during
the
semester,
the
final
A,
made
all
of
the
Bs
worth
it.
I
know
that
I
am
still
far
from
being
a
perfect
writer,
but
I
also
know
that
the
journey
to
become
one
makes
every
B
an
amazing
experience.
