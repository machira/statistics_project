Personal
Writing
History
Throughout
the
years,
my
writing
has
been
primarily
based
around
school.
I
rarely
write
stories
or
poems
outside
of
school
and
rarely
let
others
read
my
work.
Writing
that
is
unrelated
to
my
education
is
very
personal
for
me.
When
my
thoughts
and
feelings
are
expressed
in
writing
I
feel
more
vulnerable.
The
words
are
more
permanent
and
potent
than
those
that
are
merely
spoken.
However,
at
times,
writing
is
the
only
way
I
can
truly
express
my
reality.
My
first
memory
of
writing
isn't
very
clear.
I
vaguely
remember
writing
my
name
with
crayons
in
my
coloring
books
and
random
pieces
of
paper.
Before
kindergarten
my
writing
consisted
primarily
of
the
names
of
my
family:
mom,
dad,
and
Ali.
I
don't
remember
doing
any
constructive
writing
before
I
arrived
at
13th
and
Union,
my
elementary
school.
I
was
recently
told
that
I
was
not
a
strong
reader
during
my
first
few
years
at
that
fine
educational
institution.
I
have
no
memory
of
this,
but
I
was
actually
a
slow
reader.
I
realize
now
how
this
explains
why
I
was
tracked
into
the
second
smartest
classes
until
the
greater
part
of
my
secondary
educationNeveryone
was
placed
by
their
reading
level.
Thus,
I
spent
my
first
few
years
in
my
NbetaO
classes
learning
how
to
count
and
read
aloud
to
the
class
all
the
while
trying
desperately
to
reach
the
intellectual
level
of
the
Nalphas.O
My
earliest
solid
recollection
involving
writing
involves
that
grayish-brown
paper
with
green
lines
halved
by
dotted
red
lines.
Those
red
and
green
lines
plagued
my
existence
in
third
grade,
for
our
teacher
was
determined
to
use
this
implement
of
torture
in
the
hopes
of
teaching
us
how
to
write
in
cursive.
We
saw
little
use
for
cursive.
It
was
difficult,
time-consuming,
extremely
messy,
and
required
this
special
paper
that
made
oneOs
writing
very
large.
To
us
this
was
irrational.
God
forbid
if
your
NmO
didnOt
stay
below
that
red
dotted
line
or
your
lowercase
NtO
accidentally
touched
the
top
green
line.
You
would
be
punished
further
with
additional
letter
exercises.
Apparently,
the
daily
repetition
of
practicing
the
same
letters,
uppercase
and
lower
case,
workedNI
still
continue
to
use
that
cursed
cursive
today.
However,
like
everyone
else
in
the
class,
I
was
never
fully
proficient
in
writing
the
true
cursive
uppercase
forms
of
NF,O
NQ,O
and
NZ,O
so
I
refuse
to
use
them
to
this
day
simply
to
defy
my
third
grade
teacher.
As
I
became
an
upperclassman
at
13th
and
Union
I
began
reading
more
books,
and
as
we
all
know,
with
books
come
book
reports.
I
generally
received
good
marks
on
all
of
my
writings,
but
I
never
felt
especially
proud
of
these
grades.
These
grades
required
little
work;
the
assignments
were
straightforward
and
required
minimal
thinking.
Practically
anyone
could
achieve
an
NAO
if
he
or
she
had
read
the
book.
However,
fourth
and
fifth
grade
did
mark
a
new
stage
in
my
writing
abilities:
white
paper
with
thin
blue
lines
and
the
demand
that
cursive
is
used
at
all
times.
Good-bye
printing.
This
brings
us
to
Northeast,
my
middle
school,
which
is
just
a
few
blocks
down
13th
Street
from
my
elementary
school.
Sixth
grade
marked
the
arrival
of
that
shrewish
teacher
Ms.
Cafferelli.
This
English
class
was
unchallenging
and
consisted
mainly
of
reading
unstimulating
plays
from
our
Weekly
Reader.
By
seventh
grade
many
of
my
other
classes
required
us
to
write.
We
had
to
learn
to
write
differently
for
Mr.
NDisco
DaveO
RenningerOs
joke
of
a
science
class
than
Mr.
WaltonOs
history
class.
WaltonOs
class
is
where
I
started
to
really
appreciate
writing.
Using
the
observations
of
the
eyes,
ears,
nose,
mouth,
and
touch,
we
were
to
describe
a
day
in
the
life
of
a
Cro-Magnon,
Egyptian,
lady
in
waiting,
and
so
on.
This
was
my
first
taste
of
semi-creative
writing,
and
it
intrigued
me.
My
tryst
with
creative
writing
began
and
sadly
ended
in
eighth
grade
with
the
wacky
Ms.
Smith.
She
gave
us
such
imaginative
assignments.
One
of
my
favorites
was
when
she
asked
us
to
write
a
story
from
partial
pictures
she
randomly
handed
out
to
the
class.
They
resembled
a
screw,
antennae,
and
fork.
Every
story
was
different
and
equally
enthralling
for
the
most
part.
My
story
involved
a
mysterious
new
teacher
who
was
later
discovered
to
be
an
alien
who
wanted
to
steal
human
slaves
for
his
planet.
I
had
to
write
my
first
scary
story
in
her
class.
Seeing
as
how
I
was
going
through
my
obsession
with
vampires,
it
was
only
too
obvious
that
I
would
base
my
story
upon
those
blood-sucking
creatures
of
the
night.
These
were
the
first
assignments
that
really
required
innovative
thinking
on
my
part.
How
could
I
convincingly
have
Sam
become
a
vampire?
How
could
I
relate
this
to
modern
life?
These
tasks
were
more
challenging
than
the
usual
regurgitation
of
facts
and
summaries
of
stories.
My
imagination
had
never
been
given
a
challenge
that
great.
My
second
favorite
assignment
given
by
Ms.
Smith
was
called
Ngroup
writing.O
This
form
of
expression
consists
of
pulling
desks
into
a
circle
and
giving
a
piece
of
paper
to
every
student.
Each
student
is
allowed
to
write
the
beginning
of
a
story
for
one
minute.
Then
the
papers
are
switched
to
the
right.
Each
student
writes
for
one
minute
and
then
switches
again.
This
continues
until
every
student
has
contributed
a
few
lines
to
each
story.
The
results
were
hilarious,
and
the
assignment
itself
was
liberating.
For
the
first
time,
writing
was
fun
and
not
the
usual
intimidating
and
confining
means
of
communication.
It
was
in
this
class
that
I
first
tried
what
Ms.
Smith
called
Nflow
writing.O
We
sat
at
our
desks
and
wrote
whatever
we
were
thinking
at
the
moment
no
matter
how
insignificant
while
completely
ignoring
all
rules
of
grammar.
I
realized
that
writing
could
be
freeing.
If
I
ignored
my
tendency
to
create
perfect
sentences,
I
was
able
to
express
myself.
I
fumbled
over
words
in
daily
conversation
but
was
able
to
take
the
time
to
find
the
right
words
to
express
my
exact
feelings
in
writing
Although
Ms.
SmithOs
class
was
fun
and
imaginatively
challenging,
we
had
no
solid
training
in
grammar.
My
seventh
grade
student
teacher
had
done
a
poor
job
when
it
came
to
teaching
the
basics
of
any
English
class:
how
to
diagram
a
sentence,
name
at
least
5
prepositions,
determine
when
to
use
commas,
etc.
Every
teacher
since
seventh
or
eighth
grade
has
simply
assumed
that
we
understand
why
we
use
the
word
NwhomO
when
asking,
NWhom
is
the
telephone
for?O
By
eighth
grade,
my
classmates
and
I
had
a
minimal
knowledge
of
grammar.
I
myself
am
a
comma
whore,
using
seemingly
erratic
commas
through
my
sentence.
Although
reading
Woe
is
I
remedied
my
problem
to
an
extent,
I
still
have
a
poor
understanding
as
to
why
some
rules
are
followed.
However,
this
was
least
of
my
problems.
High
School
writing
provided
more
challenges
than
merely
following
the
few
grammar
rules
I
was
or
was
not
taught.
I
was
oblivious
to
the
worse
that
was
about
to
come:
the
critical
essay.
As
we
enrolled
in
English
9X,
or
honors
English,
we
had
no
idea
of
the
pain
summer
reading
would
soon
inflict
upon
us.
Not
only
would
we
have
to
read
more
serious
books
like
The
Old
Man
and
the
Sea,
A
Separate
Peace,
and
Of
Mice
and
Men,
but
we
also
had
to
write
a
five-page
paper
on
these
three
books.
I
was
lost.
I
had
never
written
a
formal
essay
before.
I
read
the
books,
analyzed
them
as
best
I
could,
and
wrote
a
fairly
comprehensible
essay.
I
received
good
grades
on
that
paper
and
all
of
my
others
that
year,
but
I
got
little
satisfaction
in
them.
Again,
if
one
was
a
respectful
student
that
simply
threw
a
few
half-baked
ideas
onto
a
piece
of
paper,
one
could
expect
a
good
grade.
Getting
an
NAO
presented
no
real
challenge.
Mrs.
Korenda,
my
ninth
grade
English
teacher,
spent
more
time
on
performing
Romeo
and
Juliet
than
teaching
us
basic
skills
in
writing.
By
the
end
of
the
year
I
thought
I
had
become
a
better
writer,
but
looking
back,
I
see
there
was
little
improvement
in
the
way
I
wrote.
My
ideas
may
have
been
more
advanced,
but
my
techniques
I
used
to
express
myself
were
not.
As
we
expected,
we
were
given
more
difficult
reading
material
and
a
seven
page
paper
discussing
the
theme
of
coming
of
age
in
Jane
Eyre,
Go
Tell
it
On
the
Mountain,
The
Catcher
in
the
Rye,
and
To
Kill
a
Mockingbird
in
tenth
grade.
My
new
teacher,
Mrs.
King
thought
the
papers
were
atrocious,
so
she
immediately
tried
to
teach
us
the
art
of
the
critical
essay.
The
Nweather
forecastO
format
was
drilled
into
our
heads.
This
format
starts
with
a
cute
intro,
then
a
thesis
statement,
four
to
five
proofs
of
your
thesis,
and
ends
with
a
conclusion.
Although
the
class
did
not
receive
a
full
understanding
of
the
process
and
purpose
of
a
critical
essay,
we
had
at
least
been
introduced
to
some
kind
of
writing
scheme.
Mrs.
King
also
taught
us
to
enjoy
poetry
by
reading
the
great
poems
of
others
and
writing
our
own.
We
learned
how
to
examine
a
poem
critically
and
tried
to
explain
our
thoughts
in
poetic
writing.
I
had
to
express
myself
in
carefully
chosen
and
rather
poetic
words.
I
found
this
most
challenging.
I
wasNand
still
amNnot
completely
comfortable
expressing
my
feelings
with
words.
To
this
day
I
still
have
a
difficult
time
choosing
between
writing
a
poem
or
a
critical
essay.
The
ability
to
arrange
common
words
to
convey
some
kind
of
considerable
feeling
or
depiction
of
an
image
is
still
beyond
me.
Harder
still
was
our
next
task:
a
term
paper.
I
found
this
assignment
fairly
easy
because
we
were
held
by
the
hand
every
baby
step
of
the
way.
Although
Mrs.
King
never
thoroughly
covered
the
technique
to
writing
a
term
paper,
I
feel
IOm
relatively
competent
when
it
comes
to
researching
and
organizing
my
thoughts.
Since
her
class
IOve
had
many
science
and
history
courses
that
demanded
I
have
the
ability
to
research
and
write
clearly,
and
I
feel
IOm
fairly
competent
at
this
kind
of
writing.
In
terms
of
writing,
eleventh
grade
was
uneventful.
I
learned
no
new
writing
skills
unless
one
wants
to
count
the
joke
of
a
speech
we
had
to
write
for
my
new
teacher,
Ms.
Hall.
This
class
consisted
mainly
of
learning
about
different
periods
of
writing
and
then
regurgitating
answers
to
the
bookOs
questions.
I
came
out
of
eleventh
grade
with
Ms.
Hall
worse
than
I
had
entered
her
room
at
the
beginning
of
the
year.
My
writing
had
become
lazy
and
unorganized,
because
she
allowed
it.
Again,
simply
reading
the
material
and
making
a
general
effort
granted
you
an
NAO
for
the
quarter,
so
I
rarely
put
forth
my
best
effort.
Finally,
in
twelfth
grade
came
a
teacher
who
whipped
our
grammar
lacking,
fact
regurgitating,
and
Nweather
forecastingO
kids
into
shape.
Her
name
was
Mrs.
Ely.
The
best
thing
she
did
was
to
grade
our
summer
reading
papers
using
relatively
college
level
standards.
By
demanding
more
of
her
students,
we
supplied
more.
She
requested
that
we
pick
two
of
our
summer
reading
papers
to
rewrite,
and
this
time,
Nfor
godOs
sake,
make
them
more
interesting.O
Ely
wasnOt
happy
with
the
formulaic
model
we
had
been
taught.
From
then
on,
we
couldnOt
simply
plug
in
the
correct
info
into
the
appropriate
place
and
get
an
NAO
quality
essay.
For
the
first
time,
I
was
rewriting
a
paper.
I
had
never
seriously
rewritten
a
rough
draft
before;
a
paper
was
always
a
last-of-the-minute
assignment
for
me.
Now
I
had
a
chance
to
reorganize
my
thoughts
and
even
rethink
my
initial
reasoning.
Even
though
writing
outlines
and
rough
drafts
seemed
worthless
and
too
time
consuming,
I
was
beginning
to
learn
that
by
using
them
I
could
write
a
higher
quality
paper.
My
writing
became
more
organized.
There
was
less
redundancy,
and
my
ideas
were
more
concentrated
in
my
papers.
My
tendency
to
write
papers
at
the
last
minute
was
also
slowly
beginning
to
wane.
All
of
a
sudden
I
was
in
college.
Did
I
feel
prepared?
Looking
back,
I
was
fairly
calm
when
imagining
the
writing
I
would
be
doing
in
the
near
future.
I
felt
that
I
wasnOt
a
great
writer,
but
I
could
hold
my
own.
First
Year
Seminar
was
my
first
writing
class
here
at
Lafayette.
I
believe
my
writing
skills
grew
that
semester
not
because
I
had
a
great
teacher,
but
merely
because
I
was
in
college.
I
thought
it
was
expected
of
me
to
put
more
effort
into
everything
I
did.
Reading
my
FYS
papers,
I
see
a
significant
improvement
in
my
writing
from
high
school.
My
arguments
were
clear
and
fairly
persuasive.
IOm
still
baffled
how
I
managed
to
write
a
coherent
research
paper
on
Buddhism,
a
religion
I
had
previously
known
nothing
about.
The
next
required
English
class
came
next
semester
in
the
form
of
College
Writing.
Finally,
I
was
brought
back
to
the
days
of
Ms.
Smith.
Although
the
writing
we
did
wasnOt
what
I
would
call
Ncreative,O
it
was
more
artistic
and
inspired
than
my
lab
reports,
term
papers,
and
answers
to
essay
questions.
This
new
professor
gave
traditional
writing
assignments
a
twist.
I
took
full
advantage
of
the
situation.
Where
else
would
I
be
allowed
to
write
a
paper
called
NParties
and
Alcohol:
an
Effective
Combination
for
Integrating
High
School
SubculturesO
which
examines
the
purpose
and
existence
of
a
teenage
social
hierarchy
in
the
movie
CanOt
Hardly
Wait?
Although
I
learned
no
technical
skills
that
semester,
I
learned
how
to
Njazz
usO
my
writing
up
to
make
it
more
enjoyable
to
read.
It
allowed
me
to
loosen
up
by
ignoring
some
grammar
rules
some
of
the
time.
It
felt
liberating
and
I
was
not
as
intimidated
by
the
writing
process
while
in
that
course.
The
next
semester
I
had
a
comparative
literature
course
that
I
barely
wrote
in.
The
professor
was
happy
receiving
a
collection
of
unsubstantiated
and
fragmentary
statements
as
long
as
it
seemed
as
if
the
student
had
made
an
effort,
so
this
is
what
I
provided.
I
find
that
if
a
teacher
does
not
demand
the
highest
quality
from
me
in
the
first
few
days
that
I
rarely
try
to
achieve
it.
However,
my
latest
required
writing
course
was
quite
the
opposite
of
this.
My
VAST
professor
was
unlike
any
other
I
had
ever
had.
If
you
handed
in
average
work
you
received
an
average,
NC,O
grade.
After
my
fellow
students
and
I
stopped
our
groaning,
my
writing
truly
began
to
improve.
Because
he
demanded
superior
writing
almost
every
class
session,
I
was
continually
writing
and
improving.
Seeing
as
this
happened
only
a
few
months
ago,
it
is
difficult
to
truly
reflect
on
how
the
class
affected
my
writing,
but
IOm
sure
it
made
a
dramatic
change
for
the
better.
I
have
recently
been
spotted
willingly
using
outlines
and
correcting
multiple
rough
drafts.
That
within
itself
is
a
great
improvement.
In
closing,
IOm
a
decent
writer.
IOve
had
an
average
writing
education
with
both
helpful
and
seemingly
useless
teachers.
Reflecting,
I
realize
that
I
am
most
comfortable
with
the
two
extremes
types
of
assignments,
because
it
is
clear
what
style
of
writing
is
appropriate.
I
find
it
easy
to
write
a
lab
report
or
a
satirical
movie
review
but
find
it
difficult
to
write
at
a
level
between
these
two
papers.
If
I
had
to
make
any
future
goals
involving
my
writing
they
would
definitely
include
finally
buckling
down
and
learning
more
grammar,
cutting
back
on
my
use
of
commas,
becoming
more
comfortable
with
others
reading
my
writing,
and
finally
learning
how
to
write
that
capital
NFO
in
cursive.
