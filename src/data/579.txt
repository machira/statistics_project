Literary

I
have
always
constructed
a
rather
romantic
picture
of
what
I
believed
the
life
of
a
writer
to
be.
The
image
of
a
frazzled
author
buried
under
mounds
of
books,
scribbling
furiously
on
crumpled
sheets
of
paper,
animated
by
sudden
bursts
of
inspiration,
had
a
certain
appeal
to
it
but
I
was
conscious
that
I
was
as
far
from
that
reality
as
I
could
possibly
be
and
I
therefore
never
considered
myself
as
a
writer.
My
opportunities
to
put
my
ideas
on
paper
have
always
been
strictly
confined
to
school
assignments
or
essay
competitions.
Yet,
despite
the
compulsory
aspect
of
my
writing
experience,
I
have
always
enjoyed
the
challenge
of
communicating
my
thoughts
to
an
objective
reader
and
potentially
convincing
the
latter
of
the
validity
of
my
ideas.
As
time
passed
by,
my
writing
assignments
changed
and
so
did
my
writing
style
but
my
relationship
with
this
art
form
stayed
the
same.
The
circumstances
which
pushed
me
to
write
shaped
the
way
that
I
responded
to
this
activity
and
perhaps
set
the
conditions
in
which
I
could
excel
as
writer.
Writing
is
a
game
which
is
invariably
accompanied
by
a
reward,
be
it
a
grade,
a
prize,
a
scholarship
or
simply
the
recognition
for
a
job
well
done
and
it
is
a
game
that
I
have
always
tried
my
best
to
win.
Although
the
reward
can
provide
sufficient
motivation
for
success,
it
is
the
pressure
that
accompanies
strictly
timed
writing
assignments
that
defines
me
as
a
writer.
My
writing
experience
truly
started
when
I
turned
twelve
and
somehow
got
cornered
by
my
father
into
entering
a
national
French
program
which
revolved
around
annual
competitions
in
essay
writing,
grammar
and
spelling.
My
coach,
an
eccentric
lady
with
the
enthusiasm
of
a
six-year
old,
quickly
infected
me
with
her
love
of
linguistics
and
literature
and
from
that
moment
on
I
knew
I
would
follow
a
literary
path
in
high
school.
My
secondary
school
experience
therefore
consisted
primarily
in
writing
long,
tortuous
essays
centered
on
the
numerous
flaws
of
Man.
Be
it
for
a
grade
or
a
prize,
in
English
or
in
French,
I
always
had
to
go
through
the
same
processes
in
order
to
accomplish
my
task.
I
usually
had
a
couple
of
hours
to
write
about
a
particular
topic
and
the
key
to
success
was
to
think
well
and
to
think
fast.
I
am
not
quite
sure
whether
or
not
I
truly
savored
my
writing
experience
in
such
moments
but
the
rush
of
adrenaline
that
came
with
the
ominous
ticking
clock
and
the
urgency
to
fill
the
blank
paper
screaming
at
me
always
provided
enough
excitement
to
gear
my
brain
into
action.
The
good
thing
about
timed
writing
was
that
it
trained
me
to
organize
my
thoughts
as
though
my
life
depended
on
it.
A
cow
could
have
been
performing
Swan
Lake
in
a
tutu
and
I
would
not
have
stopped
writing.
Everything
that
I
wrote
required
that
I
obliterate
the
world
around
me
and
immerse
myself
in
my
assigned
topic.
Since
all
my
writing
assignments
were
paper-based,
I
also
got
to
train
my
hand
to
run
a
marathon
against
the
clock.
Writing
the
best
paper
almost
always
demanded
that
I
write
as
much
as
I
could,
as
fast
as
I
could
in
order
to
fully
cover
a
topic.
Aside
from
resulting
in
my
right
forearm
being
more
muscled
than
my
left
one,
this
painful
exercise
allowed
me
to
think
as
fast
as
I
wrote
and
to
write
as
fast
as
I
thought.
Writing
in
such
conditions
never
allowed
me
to
contemplate
whether
or
not
I
was
a
good
writer.
It
almost
never
allowed
me
to
wonder
whether
or
not
I
was
writing
a
good
paper.
I
wrote
what
made
sense
to
me
at
that
moment
and
I
let
out
a
small
part
of
myself
in
everything
I
wrote.
Every
minute
spent
questioning
myself
was
equal
to
a
sentence
lost
and
a
potentially
vital
idea
not
making
it
onto
my
creased
sheets
of
paper.
So
I
threw
caution
to
the
wind
and
battled
with
time,
paper
and
slippery
pens
to
win
my
reader
with
my
thoughts
and
convictions.
Every
assignment
was
a
unique
experience
to
me,
one
in
which
the
probability
of
failure
matched
that
of
success.
Getting
an
A
or
winning
a
prize
did
not
affect
my
level
of
confidence
in
writing
my
next
paper.
Each
topic
set
in
motion
new
sets
of
ideas
and
beliefs
which
I
had
no
time
to
question
and
yet
had
no
way
of
evaluating.
Therefore,
no
matter
if
my
ideas
were
wrong
or
right,
to
win
the
game
I
simply
had
to
resort
to
persuasion.
Developing
an
argument
and
backing
it
up
became
a
second
nature
and
the
time
constraint
made
sure
that
I
was
focused
enough
to
choose
the
most
powerful
ideas
to
either
drag
an
uncertain
reader
into
my
camp
or
prevent
a
tough
one
from
saying
that
I
was
wrong.
College
writing
therefore
threw
me
in
an
unknown
terrain
which
I
had
to
conquer
in
order
to
succeed.
Despite
choosing
a
major
which
was
once
again
writing-intensive,
I
was
thrown
out
of
my
comfort
zone
upon
seeing
my
professors
boil
down
my
writing
assignments
to
a
science.
One
would
think
that
having
my
deadline
of
two
hours
suddenly
extend
itself
to
weeks
would
elicit
squeals
of
joy
out
of
me
and
that
the
numerous
methodic
approaches
put
forward
by
my
smiling
professors
would
somehow
calm
my
nerves.
Instead,
I
struggled
not
to
run
out
the
door
screaming
my
lungs
out.
With
so
much
time
on
my
hands,
I
found
myself
unable
to
align
two
sentences
together
without
wondering
if
I
was
following
my
professorsO
directions.
Doubt
started
to
become
an
integral
part
of
my
writing
experience.
I
would
stare
at
my
computer
for
days
on
end
without
ever
being
able
to
write
a
coherent
paragraph.
My
professorsO
advice
to
write
bits
and
pieces
of
a
paper
never
worked
too
well
for
me.
I
had
always
thought
my
papers
out
in
a
linear
fashion,
first
formulating
an
argument
and
then
fleshing
it
out
in
the
most
effective
manner.
Constructing
my
paper
like
a
collage
was
something
new
for
me,
which
I
knew
could
only
worked
if
one
was
using
a
computer.
Although
I
was
quite
familiar
with
numerous
computer
programs,
typing
out
my
ideas
did
not
prove
to
be
easy.
The
process
of
deleting
words,
sentences
and
whole
paragraphs
was
so
easy
that
it
became
irresistible.
Furthermore,
since
I
typed
much
slower
than
I
wrote,
I
often
lost
track
of
my
thoughts
as
my
mind
would
wander
off
in
between
sentences.
The
weeks
that
I
was
given
to
write
my
papers
would
thus
be
wasted
as
I
would
painfully
stare
at
a
screen
as
blank
as
my
mind.
Listening
to
my
classmates
talk
about
the
number
of
pages
they
had
down
certainly
did
not
help
the
matter.
My
weeks
would
slowing
dwindle
down
to
days
while
my
fear
of
failure
would
swell
with
the
due
date
looming
ahead.
I
would
eventually
find
myself
sitting
at
my
computer
one
night
before
the
due
date,
feverishly
typing
my
paper
out
with
the
somewhat
comforting
sound
of
the
ominous
ticking
clock.
Although
writing
was
a
familiar
exercise
to
me,
I
spent
my
first
year
of
college
adjusting
to
the
new
circumstances
which
would
now
shape
my
writing
experience.
Although
I
never
could
bring
myself
to
gradually
write
my
paper
over
days
or
weeks,
I
nevertheless
put
that
time
to
good
use
by
trying
to
understand
the
mechanism
behind
a
good
paper.
I
learnt
about
cohesive
structures,
the
exposition
of
oneOs
thesis
in
an
introduction
and
its
reiteration
in
oneOs
conclusion.
I
learnt
how
to
write
bibliographies,
how
to
cite
works
of
reference.
I
learnt
the
logic
behind
a
strong
idea
and
an
irrelevant
one.
I
began
to
spot
redundant
words
and
to
replace
them
with
new
ideas.
Becoming
familiar
with
the
basic
characteristics
of
a
strong
paper
proved
to
be
extremely
valuable
and
applicable
to
all
my
writing
assignments;
be
it
a
history
paper
or
an
economics
paper,
a
research
paper
or
a
movie
critique,
they
were
all
constructed
according
to
the
same
fundamental
rules.
I
therefore
learnt
to
be
versatile
with
my
topics,
ideas
and
vocabulary
but
to
conform
to
the
same
guidelines
which
would
help
me
produce
a
strong
and
coherent
paper.
As
I
advanced
through
my
college
years,
I
found
myself
combining
the
skills
that
I
had
acquired
both
in
secondary
school
and
in
my
college
courses.
I
always
found
myself
seeking
the
pressure
that
invariably
accompanies
a
tight
deadline
and
my
papers
always
got
written
a
day
or
two
before
my
deadline.
However,
I
was
now
able
to
gauge
with
reasonable
accuracy
whether
or
not
my
paper
was
well-written.
If
I
had
been
sloppy,
I
could
spot
the
flaws
in
my
paper
and
correct
them
just
as
I
could
identify
my
strengths
while
quickly
scanning
my
work.
Understanding
why
a
paper
was
strong
or
weak
eliminated
a
certain
amount
of
uncertainty
about
the
paper
I
was
writing.
However,
it
is
still
impossible
for
me
to
view
each
and
every
paper
that
I
write
as
anything
but
a
distinct
challenge
which
needs
to
be
overcome
all
over
again.
I
can
never
be
sure
whether
or
not
my
ideas
will
be
well-received,
whether
I
have
gone
too
far
or
not
far
enough.
Every
paper
that
I
write
is
a
game
that
needs
to
be
won
once
again,
a
game
which
I
try
my
best
to
win
but
a
game
which
offers
no
guarantee
of
success
no
matter
the
number
of
hours
that
I
devote
to
it.
I
sometimes
tend
to
think
that
writing
has
proved
to
be
an
enjoyable
experience
primarily
because
of
the
excitement
and
urgency
that
often
accompanies
it.
I
still
find
it
hard
to
consider
myself
as
a
writer
and
I
have
never
thought
myself
good
enough
to
make
a
career
out
of
it.
My
writing
experience
has
always
been
controlled
by
external
factors
such
as
writing
assignments
or
competitions.
I
have
never
tried
to
write
anything
that
was
not
a
required
assignment
and
I
am
not
quite
sure
whether
or
not
I
would
be
very
successful
at
it,
should
I
give
it
a
try.
In
the
meantime,
the
world
still
fades
away
while
my
fingers
run
their
customary
race
against
time
and
my
mind
churns
out
ideas
which
sit
uncertainly
on
my
screen,
waiting
to
be
judged.
This
is
the
only
way
that
writing
can
ever
make
sense
to
me
and
it
is
perhaps
the
only
way
I
can
ever
succeed
as
a
writer.
