History
of
a
Writer
When
I
read
the
title
of
this
paper
my
first
thought
is
that
I
should
be
writing
it
on
a
famous
author
or
literary
genius,
not
on
myself.
I
never
considered
myself
to
be
a
writer.
To
me
a
writer
was
more
than
someone
who
wrote
research
papers
and
jotted
down
stories
in
a
journal.
My
writing
career
pertained
to
mundane
writing
assignments
with
some
occasional
enjoyable
moments.
There
were
times
that
I
thought
writing
was
a
waste
of
time
and
then
there
were
other
times
that
I
thought
writing
was
the
only
way
to
express
how
I
was
feeling
at
a
particular
moment.
And
now
as
I
sit
down
about
to
write
this
paper
I
will
reflect
upon
my
experiences
and
try
to
describe
my
history
as
a
writer.
Writing
at
an
early
age
was
more
than
just
school
work
it
was
torture.
The
thought
of
having
to
write
a
summary
on
a
book
made
me
want
to
hide
in
bed
for
the
rest
of
the
school
year.
It
was
not
because
I
did
not
read
the
book,
but
I
had
a
difficult
time
writing
all
my
thoughts
in
a
concise
manner.
At
the
time
I
did
not
realize
that
my
dislike
for
writing
was
due
to
the
fact
that
I
did
not
know
the
proper
techniques
to
help
me.
However,
what
I
did
realize
was
that
my
problem
with
spelling
also
hindered
my
writing
career
as
early
as
first
and
second
grade.
I
have
a
learning
disability,
which
is
known
as
auditory
discrimination.
This
condition
makes
it
difficult
to
sound
out
words
because
I
can
not
hear
the
letters,
nor
do
I
know
how
to
pronounce
the
letters
to
form
the
word.
Due
to
this
problem
I
was
embarrassed
to
write
papers
without
fear
that
my
peers
and
my
teacher
would
make
fun
of
me.
This
problem
also
stopped
me
from
using
more
complex
words
in
my
hand
written
assignments
because
I
am
not
sure
how
to
spell
them.
Because
of
this
a
lot
of
papers
would
come
back
with
comments
written
on
them
referring
to
better
word
choices
or
encouraging
me
to
incorporate
more
complex
words
into
the
paper.
When
I
was
younger
this
challenge
had
a
larger
impact
on
my
writing
since
the
assignments
were
done
in
class
and
with
out
the
use
of
spell
check
on
the
computer.
As
I
progressed
in
school
and
technology
progressed
also
my
spelling
problem
has
improved
greatly.
However,
every
now
and
again
when
a
hand
written
essay
is
due
in
class
my
spelling
insecurity
will
creep
up.
I
still
see
this
as
a
problem,
but
I
am
working
on
over
coming
it
by
taking
my
time
and
explaining
to
my
teachers
that
I
have
this
condition
and
welcome
any
suggestions
they
may
have.
The
spelling
difficulty
is
my
most
vivid
memory
of
the
first
years
of
my
writing
career.
My
fondest
memory
as
a
writer
occurred
in
the
fifth
grade.
My
school
sponsored
a
writing
contest
for
each
grade
level.
From
each
grade
level
each
classroom
had
to
select
one
person
to
represent
the
class
in
the
contest.
Along
with
every
other
kid
in
my
class
I
began
thinking
of
how
great
it
would
be
to
be
chosen
to
represent
our
class.
But
then
there
was
also
the
part
of
me
that
doubted
I
could
write
well
enough
to
be
chosen.
I
explained
the
contest
to
my
mom,
and
she
encouraged
me
to
write
the
best
story
I
could
think
of.
I
immediately
began
writing
my
very
own
mystery
story.
I
even
included
a
drawing
on
the
cover
like
a
real
book.
I
was
so
proud
to
hand
the
assignment
in,
and
anxiously
waited
to
hear
the
results.
Weeks
went
by
and
we
heard
no
news
about
the
contest,
until
one
day
my
teacher
went
to
the
front
of
the
classroom
and
announced
that
my
story
had
been
selected
to
represent
the
class.
I
could
not
believe
that
I
wrote
something
that
others
believed
was
good
enough
to
be
chosen.
The
following
week
a
school
assembly
was
held
were
the
selected
stories
were
read
out
loud.
It
was
an
honor
to
hear
my
story
read,
and
to
this
day
that
event
has
inspired
me
to
write
with
pride
and
effort.
The
next
few
years
in
middle
school
were
uneventful
in
the
writing
department
compared
to
my
big
moment
in
the
fifth
grade.
Then
two
years
later
I
was
introduced
to
my
first
typewriting
class.
This
class
was
dreading
by
the
whole
school.
Along
with
everyone
else
I
could
not
understand
the
point
of
the
class,
since
we
did
not
use
typewriters
anymore
why
did
we
need
the
class.
It
was
not
until
my
freshman
year
in
high
school
did
I
understand
that
the
typewriting
class
showed
me
how
to
be
an
efficient
writer
while
typing
at
a
computer.
I
could
concentrate
on
expressing
my
thoughts,
rather
than
concentrating
on
where
the
letters
were
located
on
the
keyboard.
The
class
also
taught
me
that
there
are
useful
and
diverse
tools
for
writing.
The
creative
writing/research
class
of
my
freshman
year
in
high
school
put
these
tools
and
techniques
to
the
test.
.
It
was
my
first
true
introduction
to
the
different
types
of
research
papers
and
assignments
along
with
a
heavy
concentration
on
computers.
Until
this
class
I
still
wrote
a
lot
of
my
reports
by
hand
and
had
limited
knowledge
on
the
wide
variety
of
writing
styles
and
genres
of
writing.
The
creative
writing
class
was
not
a
class
I
looked
forward
to
going
to
everyday.
It
was
difficult
to
understand
how
you
could
write
and
rewrite
a
paper
improving
it
each
time.
Until
this
point
I
was
use
to
turning
a
paper
in
and
getting
it
back
with
a
grade
on
it
and
some
minor
corrections.
But
now
I
was
writing
a
paper
and
instead
of
a
grade
there
were
comments
by
the
teacher
and
then
later
on
my
peers.
It
was
at
this
point
that
my
earlier
problem
with
being
concise
and
having
flow
to
my
paper
began
to
show.
Thankfully
at
this
time
I
learned
to
make
an
outline
to
help
structure
my
papers
in
a
more
organized
manner.
But
even
though
I
had
this
tool
to
help
me
I
rarely
took
advantage
of
it
or
implemented
it
as
often
as
I
should
have.
This
is
why
I
still
have
to
push
myself
to
do
an
outline
if
I
want
to
improve
my
writing.
The
creative
writing
class
taught
me
about
my
weaknesses
as
a
writer,
but
it
also
made
me
leery
of
peer
review.
All
through
high
school
and
including
my
freshman
year
of
college
I
dreaded
peer
review.
The
fear
had
to
do
with
my
spelling
as
well
as
my
lack
of
confidence
as
a
writer.
This
lack
of
confidence
came
from
my
uneasiness
of
knowing
there
is
no
right
answer
in
writing.
I
have
always
been
drawn
to
math
and
science
because
there
are
structured
rules
and
formulas
and
if
you
follow
them
your
answer
should
be
correct.
For
example
two
plus
two
is
four,
one
can
not
raise
their
hand
and
argue
that
the
answer
is
five.
But
in
writing
there
are
rules
but
those
guide
the
way
you
write,
but
not
what
you
write.
For
others
this
may
seem
liberating,
but
at
the
time
I
thought
it
was
terrifying.
What
if
the
others
did
not
like
what
I
was
saying
or
that
they
were
utterly
confused
by
the
point
I
was
trying
to
make?
I
did
not
handle
the
constructive
criticism
well
or
the
lack
of
structure.
I
felt
very
awkward
to
have
others
read
and
judge
my
work.
The
awkwardness
of
having
others
read
my
work
did
no
pertain
to
school
alone.
Through
the
early
years
of
my
writing
career
my
mom
was
the
one
who
read
all
of
my
papers
before
I
handed
them
in.
She
would
make
little
corrections
on
the
paper
and
then
later
discuss
them
with
me.
I
would
get
frustrated
if
she
tried
to
reword
something
or
take
out
a
sentence.
And
this
was
what
I
was
like
with
my
own
mom
reading
my
work,
so
imagine
how
I
was
with
strangers.
However,
as
that
class
came
to
an
end
I
realized
that
my
mom
and
my
classmates
are
not
trying
to
pass
judgment
on
me
they
are
trying
to
help
me
improve
my
writing.
From
this
class
I
learned
that
there
is
always
room
for
improvement,
and
I
slowly
began
to
welcome
comments
from
others.
That
class
also
helped
with
another
English
class
I
was
taking.
In
this
class
we
had
to
keep
a
journal
for
five-minute
exercises.
Each
morning
my
teacher
would
have
a
topic
or
question,
and
we
had
five
minutes
to
write
as
much
as
we
could
about
the
topic/question
without
worrying
about
spelling
or
grammatical
points.
This
was
a
wonderful
experience
for
me
because
I
could
express
myself
with
out
fear
of
being
judged
on
my
spelling
or
writing
style.
The
writing
exercises
gave
us
a
chance
to
write
our
first
thoughts
on
the
topic
since
we
only
had
five
minutes
and
this
somewhat
exciting
and
interesting
to
see
what
those
thoughts
were.
Then
every
two
weeks
my
teacher
would
collect
the
books
and
discuss
with
us
each
topic
and
why
we
chose
to
write
what
we
did.
I
enjoyed
these
meetings
with
the
teacher
since
it
gave
me
a
chance
to
discuss
my
writing
one
on
one
and
get
feed
back
from
him,
which
before
I
was
scared
to
get.
High
school
opened
my
eyes
to
a
wide
variety
of
writing
besides
journal
entries
and
book
reports.
I
learned
how
to
write
debate
speeches,
opinion
papers,
research
papers,
biographies,
and
the
dreaded
senior
thesis
paper.
Since
I
was
a
freshman
in
high
school
I
remember
hearing
about
the
senior
thesis
paper.
I
was
very
nervous
about
writing
a
paper
that
made
up
over
50
percent
of
my
final
grade.
This
paper
made
all
the
other
writing
assignments
seem
insignificant.
But
as
the
time
approached,
and
I
wrote
the
paper
I
realized
that
those
insignificant
assignments
were
not
as
unimportant
as
I
first
thought.
They
were
like
practice
runs
for
the
main
event
and
also
for
what
there
was
to
come.
The
senior
paper
took
time
and
effort,
but
those
other
little
experiences
helped
prepare
me,
and
made
the
experience
pleasant.
By
the
time
my
freshman
year
of
college
came
along
I
was
feeling
more
confident
in
my
writing.
My
first
writing
class
was
First
Year
Seminar
Class.
That
class
helped
build
my
confidence
as
a
college
writer.
I
was
prepared
for
the
teacher
comments
and
also
the
peer
reviews.
And
after
just
finishing
my
senior
thesis
I
felt
I
was
ready
for
what
college
writing
had
to
offer.
The
FYS
class
allowed
me
to
put
my
techniques
that
I
picked
up
as
a
writer
to
use.
What
also
helped
was
that
the
class
was
enjoyable
and
I
enjoyed
the
topic
of
the
class,
which
was
on
race
and
stereotypes.
I
feel
that
writing
on
something
one
enjoys
helps
improve
the
quality
of
the
writing
and
makes
writing
more
interesting.
The
more
a
person
dreads
a
topic
the
less
enthusiastic
they
are
and
it
shows
in
the
writing.
The
FYS
class
also
showed
me
that
the
saying
Nquality
over
quantityO
is
true.
I
use
to
be
intimidated
by
papers
with
no
page
limits,
but
I
soon
realized
that
I
could
write
a
lot
about
nothing
or
I
could
write
less
and
feel
proud
and
confident
in
what
I
am
turning
in.
The
attitude
and
quality
of
a
writer
is
not
so
much
in
the
mechanics,
but
in
the
way
they
convey
their
thoughts
and
opinions
to
the
reader.
Another
important
factor
is
the
confidence
the
writer
has
in
them.
If
the
writer
does
not
believe
in
themselves
than
how
can
the
readers
believe
what
they
are
reading?
This
confidence
takes
time
as
well
as
practice.
My
confidence
and
practice
in
writing
was
gained
in
my
college
writing
class
the
second
semester
of
my
freshman
year.
This
class
challenged
me
as
a
writer
and
as
a
student.
The
class
focused
on
revising
work
and
keeping
a
portfolio
of
our
work
along
with
notes
commenting
on
the
revision
of
the
assignments.
As
mentioned
earlier
I
had
a
hard
time
with
taking
comments
from
others,
and
to
take
a
class
based
solely
on
peer
review
and
self-evaluation
was
a
challenge
for
me.
I
thought
of
dropping
the
class
because
it
did
not
sound
like
something
I
could
handle
or
do
well
in.
But
after
speaking
with
my
teacher
and
with
my
family
I
realized
that
this
class
was
exactly
what
I
needed.
I
had
to
confront
the
problem
of
commenting
on
my
own
work
and
revising
it.
If
I
did
not
take
that
class
that
writing
flaw
would
follow
me
where
ever
I
went.
It
is
remarkable
to
look
back
at
my
writing
before
the
college
writing
class.
The
change
in
my
writing
is
drastic
and
I
am
not
the
only
one
who
has
noticed
it.
When
I
now
show
my
mom
the
papers
I
write
she
can
not
believe
the
drastic
improvement
in
my
writing
style
and
mechanics.
The
college
writing
class
also
changed
my
outlook
on
peer
review.
It
is
not
a
negative
tool,
but
a
way
to
help
one
another.
I
now
welcome
others
to
read
my
writing
and
point
out
ways
to
improve
my
paper
or
correct
spelling
mistakes.
The
ironic
thing
about
writing
this
particular
paper
is
that
I
wrote
about
how
I
can
not
comment
on
my
own
writing
or
self
evaluate,
but
yet
I
just
wrote
an
entire
paper
on
it.
Which
just
goes
to
show
I
have
improved.
It
also
shows
that
I
do
have
a
history
as
a
writer
and
also
a
future
as
one.
A
writer
does
not
have
to
be
published
or
famous.
They
can
be
someone
like
me
who
uses
it
to
convey
everyday
thoughts
and
opinions
on
important
topics.
Writing
is
an
important
tool
that
should
not
be
feared.
I
no
longer
fear
writing,
but
appreciate
it
for
allowing
me
to
express
who
I
am.
