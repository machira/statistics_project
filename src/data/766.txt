Returning
WA
Narrative
Working
as
a
WA
this
past
year
has
influenced
my
writing
by
making
me
more
self-aware
of
what
I
write,
and
also
how
it
is
perceived
by
others.
I
was
a
strong
believer
in
writing
and
turning
in
one
draft
of
an
assignment,
unless
it
was
something
particularly
challenging
or
something
for
which
a
professor
mandated
multiple
drafts.
However,
after
working
with
students
on
revising
their
papers,
I
have
come
to
see
the
importance
of
self-revision,
and
have
begun
to
use
that
process
more
in
my
own
writing.
One
experience
in
particular
that
influenced
me
was
working
with
Professor
SunderlinOs
First
Year
Seminar
on
multiple
drafts
of
their
final
paper.
Very
few
of
the
students
began
and
ended
with
a
paper
of
the
same
quality;
rather,
most
students
improved
drastically
in
achieving
the
goal
of
clear
self-expression
between
drafts.
One
student
came
in
with
so
many
ideas
that
he
described
them
to
me
continuously
for
twenty
minutes,
yet
very
few
of
these
ideas
were
expressed
in
his
writing.
The
WA
conference
helped
him
to
narrow
down
his
ideas
to
critical
points
and
to
actually
lay
these
points
out
in
writing.
Another
student
was
overwhelmed
by
the
amount
of
development
of
ideas
that
was
necessary
to
write
a
longer
paper
D
for
her,
the
multiple
drafts
allowed
her
to
expand
and
fully
explain
each
idea.
Viewing
the
helpfulness
of
the
rewriting
process
has
caused
my
writing
process
now
to
involve
writing
more
than
one
copy
of
a
particular
assignment,
and
putting
more
care
into
reading
through
each
draft
from
an
NoutsiderOsO
perspective
to
see
if
I
am
expressing
myself
well.
The
disparity
that
is
sometimes
evident
between
a
studentOs
paper
and
the
ideas
the
student
mentions
in
a
conversation
with
a
WA
has
also
highlighted
to
me
that
it
does
not
matter
the
depth
or
breadth
of
your
idea
for
an
assignment
if
that
idea
is
not
expressed
on
the
paper.
The
paper
must
be
able
to
speak
for
itself
when
being
read.
Some
students
had
to
talk
a
lot
to
answer
a
question
that
pertained
to
their
writing,
and
only
after
explaining
it
all
out
loud
did
they
realize
that
their
paper
did
not
contain
enough
information
or
detail
to
stand
alone
and
be
well
understood.
As
mentioned,
WA
conferences
often
reveal
a
division
between
the
WAOs
interpretation
of
the
paper
D
based
on
what
the
student
has
written
down
D
and
the
writerOs
interpretation
of
the
paper
D
based
on
what
thoughts
the
writer
has
in
his
or
her
head.
The
most
important
moments
in
WA
conferences,
for
me,
have
been
moments
where
students
have
become
cognizant
of
that
disparity.
Students
in
the
VaST
for
which
I
was
a
WA
had
to
write
strategies
for
eliminating
a
disease
of
their
choosing
from
the
world.
The
strategy
was
supposed
to
be
written
succinctly
yet
accurately;
however,
many
writers
included
broad
sentences
in
their
first
drafts
without
explaining
how
such
a
goal
would
be
executed.
When
I
asked
them
to
explain,
virtually
every
single
person
could
tell
me
what
execution
of
the
goal
would
look
like
in
reality,
and
then
realized
that
they
needed
to
put
that
on
the
paper
to
achieve
the
goals
of
the
summary.
Frequently,
a
seemingly
under-developed
paper
was
accompanied
to
a
conference
by
a
student
who
had,
in
fact,
put
a
lot
of
time
into
developing
ideas
and
has
many
workable
ones:
they
just
were
not
yet
in
the
paper,
as
with
some
of
the
FYS
students
mentioned
above.
Therefore,
after
a
year
as
a
WA,
my
notion
of
what
makes
a
successful
conference
is
very
idea-based
D
a
good
conference
helps
writers
to
express
fully
the
ideas
in
their
head
on
a
piece
of
paper.
Another
important
moment
in
WA
conferences
involves
helping
students
to
develop
ideas
in
their
head
before
they
start
putting
them
onto
paper.
Sometimes,
the
underdeveloped
paper
is
accompanied
by
a
student
with
underdeveloped
ideas,
who
has
had
no
time
to
think
about
the
assignment
or
who
has
developed
a
mental
block
about
being
able
to
Ndo
wellO
on
a
particular
piece
of
writing.
The
method
taught
at
WA
meetings
of
asking
many
probing
questions
during
a
conference
is
particularly
effective
here
in
helping
students
to
develop
an
idea
and
become
excited
about
writing
it
down.
A
VaST
class
I
was
the
WA
for
was
responsible
for
writing
several
creative
pieces,
which
often
led
to
writers
becoming
stuck
mentally
as
they
struggled
with
an
unfamiliar
type
of
writing.
Asking
a
lot
of
questions
about
their
pieces
forced
them
to
come
up
with
some
type
of
answers,
and
often
they
struck
upon
an
idea
that
made
them
more
enthusiastic
about
creative
writing.
The
idea
of
WA
conferences
as
a
forum
for
encouraging
successful
self-expression
is
occasionally
challenged
by
a
student
that
has
pressing
concerns
about
their
grammar
or
certain
stylistic
issues.
While
it
is
still
possible
to
discuss
ideas
with
such
students,
I
have
found
it
is
often
first
necessary
to
address
their
worries
about
their
use
of
grammar
or
punctuation
D
at
least
to
some
degree
D
before
moving
on
to
the
Nbigger
pictureO
of
the
conference.
While
at
first
difficult
for
me
to
tackle,
dealing
with
writers
who
really
want
to
know,
immediately,
whether
they
have
used
too
many
commas,
has
become
easier
with
a
few
conferences.
The
facilitative
approach
is
useful
for
helping
people
with
grammatical
problems.
Although
many
writers
expect
to
just
be
told
whether
or
not
their
grammar
is
acceptable,
asking
them
to
read
a
sentence
out
loud
using
the
punctuation
they
are
currently
using,
for
example,
is
often
far
more
helpful
than
instructing
someone
to
remove
a
comma.
A
particular
example
of
someone
who
was
insisting
on
a
Ngrammar
checkO
was
a
student
who
came
to
drop-in
with
a
paper,
handed
it
to
me,
asked
me
to
check
for
grammar
mistakes,
and
started
texting.
I
had
to
explain
to
him
that
I
could
help
him
with
grammar
issues,
but
he
had
to
be
engaged
in
the
process,
and
that
perhaps
I
could
also
help
him
examine
some
Nhigher
order
concernsO
of
the
paper.
The
conference
ended
up
going
alright,
but
was
definitely
a
clear
example
of
working
with
someone
who
was
not
used
to
the
typical
method
of
WA
conferences.
Beyond
helping
people
with
grammar
issues,
the
facilitative
approach
is
helpful
for
aiding
writers
who
want
to
develop
their
ideas
further.
As
I
wrote,
helping
students
to
express
the
ideas
in
their
head
on
paper
and
helping
students
to
develop
their
own
ideas
are
two
aspects
of
WA
conferences
that
I
consider
very
important.
The
facilitative
approach
is
definitely
helpful
in
achieving
both
of
these
goals
because
it
pushes
students
to
think
for
themselves
and
come
to
realizations
about
their
writing.
It
is
especially
important
in
situations
in
which
reading
the
studentOs
paper
makes
you
think
they
mean
a
certain
thing,
but
a
conversation
with
them
using
the
facilitative
method
reveals
that
they
meant
something
else
entirely.
If
the
facilitative
method
had
not
been
used,
it
would
be
easy
to
tell
students
how
to
NfixO
their
paper,
while
actually
pushing
their
paper
in
a
different
direction
from
the
one
to
which
they
wanted
to
take
it.
Another
idea
we
have
discussed
in
WA
meetings
that
has
helped
me
in
conferences
is
BartholomaeOs
paper
NInventing
the
UniversityO.
NInventing
the
UniversityO
expanded
my
understanding
of
the
challenges
students
face
when
tackling
an
unfamiliar
subject,
and
emphasized
the
importance
of
developing
an
authoritative,
yet
reasonable,
voice
when
writing.
Being
able
to
partially
summarize
the
themes
of
NInventing
the
UniversityO
to
writers
in
conferences
has
enabled
me
to
steer
people
away
from
making
grandiose
statements,
as
well
as
to
encourage
people
to
use
a
confident
tone
in
their
writing,
even
when
exploring
new
subjects.
The
different
emotions
experienced
during
WA
conferences
D
finding
them
Ncomforting,
reassuring,
and
rewarding
(Eor)
difficult,
uncomfortable,
awkward,
or
even
frighteningO
seems
to
me
like
it
is
often
due
to
the
attitude
with
which
students
approach
conferences.
Students
who
have
had
past
bad
marks
on
writing,
or
have
never
been
encouraged
much,
may
come
in
and
expect
to
hear
more
negative
feedback.
In
that
instance,
having
a
non-critical
conversation
about
their
writing
may
be
encouraging
for
them.
However,
being
pushed
to
answer
questions
about
their
writing
could
also
be
awkward
or
difficult
for
someone
who
is
not
used
to
talking
about
their
writing
or
who
is
expecting
negative
feedback.
Someone
who
was
initially
very
confident
in
their
paper
may
also
find
a
WA
conference
difficult,
since
they
have
to
deal
with
someone
pushing
their
paper
even
further
and
finding
areas
in
which
it
could
be
improved,
even
though
the
writer
may
have
thought
it
was
already
NfinishedO.
I
think
that
it
is
difficult
to
control
how
a
writer
will
feel
during
their
first
WA
conference
since
they
are
coming
in
with
various
expectations,
but
it
is
obviously
possible
to
react
to
their
mood
and
make
them
as
comfortable
as
possible.
Hopefully,
in
the
next
few
meetings,
writers
should
feel
increasingly
comfortable
in
conferences
and
find
them
rewarding,
as
they
are
now
more
used
to
the
process
of
discussing
their
writing.
It
definitely
seems
as
if
the
more
comfortable
a
student
is
during
the
WA
conference,
the
greater
benefit
they
get
out
of
it
in
terms
of
their
writing.
Some
of
my
most
rewarding
moments
working
as
a
WA
have
come
from
helping
people
who
were
initially
skeptical
about
the
process,
or
came
in
frustrated
and
feeling
like
their
writing
was
never
going
to
turn
out
well.
Asking
a
lot
of
questions
about
their
writing
and
showing
some
enthusiasm
about
it
by
putting
emphasis
on
the
good
points
of
it
sometimes
resulted
in
the
attitude
of
the
student
changing,
and
him
or
her
leaving
and
being
much
more
excited
to
continue
work
on
the
paper.
Students
who
are
enthusiastic
or
at
least
confident
about
their
writing
seem
to
enjoy
working
on
it
much
more,
so
helping
to
give
people
a
more
positive
attitude
is
one
of
the
best
aspects
of
the
job
for
me.
On
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
the
more
frustrating
moments
in
WA
conferences
are
usually
fuelled
by
a
poor
attitude
from
students.
Fortunately
most
students
eventually
end
up
putting
some
kind
of
effort
into
the
conference
if
pushed,
but
it
can
be
frustrating
to
have
to
work
to
engage
someone
at
all.
Another
frustrating
moment
for
me
was
working
with
a
student
who
seemed
like
she
really
did
have
good
ideas,
but
could
not
express
them
either
verbally
or
in
writing.
It
was
very
difficult
to
work
out
which
questions
to
ask
her
to
enable
her
to
express
her
ideas.
The
more
questions
I
asked,
the
more
frustrated
she
became
that
she
could
not
come
up
with
a
straight
answer:
she
kept
changing
her
mind
mid-sentence
and
ending
with
NI
donOt
knowO.
It
was
hard
to
know
whether
to
keep
pushing
her
to
try
and
reach
a
more
successful
conclusion,
or
whether
to
stop
asking
questions
in
case
she
ended
up
totally
discouraged.
Her
writing
improved
between
drafts
but
I
do
not
think
it
ever
got
quite
as
good
as
it
could
have
been,
and
it
was
frustrating
not
to
be
able
to
work
out
to
say
to
help
her
achieve
her
best
possible
work.
WA
conferences
are
ultimately
very
writer-driven,
whether
that
is
in
the
form
of
accepting
the
idea
of
discussing
grammatical
concerns
first,
or
in
the
form
of
a
writer
having
a
totally
different
idea
than
the
one
I
thought
they
did,
and
throwing
all
prepared
questions
out
and
coming
up
with
new
discussion
points
on
the
spot.
Realizing
how
writer-based
WA
conferences
are
has
allowed
me
to
use
some
of
the
same
techniques
I
use
with
students
on
my
own
writing
D
although
it
seems
less
instinctive
to
ask
myself
questions
about
my
writing
and
see
how
it
differs
from
my
ideas,
it
is
definitely
possible
to
do.
It
has
also
helped
me
to
tailor
my
writing
to
specific
audiences
since
I
am
more
cognizant
of
how
student
writing
is
viewed
by
other
readers.
Despite
some
frustrations,
I
enjoyed
my
WA
conferences
during
my
first
year
of
work
and
hope
to
continue
working
well
with
students
this
year,
while
turning
the
frustrations
into
learning
points
upon
which
I
can
build.
