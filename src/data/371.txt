Returning
WA
In
terms
of
my
own
personal
writing
and
my
responsibilities
as
a
WA,
this
year
has
been
a
test
of
both
confidence
and
humility.
I
have
needed
the
confidence
to
effectively
express
myself
to
professors
and
students
through
conversation
and
writing,
especially
in
situations
in
which
effective
communication
was
a
struggle.
I
have
needed
the
humility
to
listen,
instead
of
instruct,
and
to
accept
when
my
way
is
not
the
only
way,
or
in
terms
of
my
own
writing,
is
not
the
way
the
professor
prefers.
In
order
to
express
how
my
writing
has
developed
as
a
consequence
of
becoming
a
WA,
I
will
first
outline
important
aspects
of
my
experiences
as
a
WA
this
past
year.
(This
extremely
direct,
obvious
writing
style
in
which
one
lays
out
explicitly
what
he
or
she
plans
to
do
in
the
piece
of
writing
is
a
style
that
I
have
been
taught
all
my
life
to
avoid.
Both
of
the
professors
with
whom
I
worked
this
year
appreciated
such
a
style.
Consequently,
I
have
found
myself
incorporating
what
I
was
looking
for
in
students'
writing
for
these
two
professors
into
my
own
writing
style.)
My
first
year
as
a
WA
started
with
a
fairly
overwhelming
assignment.
I
was
to
be
a
WA
for
Econ
323:Money,
Finances,
and
Financial
Intermediaries.
I
had
no
formal
economics
background.
I
had
never
taken
an
economics
course
in
my
life;
I
am
not
even
sure
if
I
am
a
close
friend
with
any
econ
majors.
I
thought
the
subject
matter
would
be
incomprehensible,
and
therefore
my
task
to
assist
the
students
(23
seniors)
would
be
unachievable.
Not
only
was
I
facing
a
social/authority
issue
by
being
a
sophomore
WA
for
a
class
of
seniors,
I
was
facing
a
new
discipline
in
which
I
had
no
right
to
demand
authority.
As
I
began
to
read
the
students'
papers,
I
quickly
realized
that
although
I
stumbled
over
terminology,
it
truly
did
not
matter
that
I
had
no
economics
background.
I
realized
the
students
had
major
concerns
that
stemmed
solely
from
their
faults
in
writing
as
opposed
to
actual
economics.
I
began
to
view
everyone
with
which
I
spoke
as
a
writer
instead
of
an
econ
student.
This
realization
affected
the
way
in
which
I
wrote.
In
the
past,
when
I
was
writing
for
a
science
class,
I
viewed
myself
as
a
scientist,
when
writing
for
philosophy,
a
philosopher.
Because
of
this,
I
completely
changed
my
writing
style
for
different
classes
and
even
further
for
personal
writing.
I
thought
that
my
personal
writing
would
never
be
linked
to
my
science
papers
and
my
science
papers
could
never
be
linked
stylistically
to
my
philosophy
papers.
While
audience
and
purpose
are
obviously
major
aspects
of
writing
that
vary
over
subject
and
genre,
from
being
a
WA,
I
began
to
realize
that
being
able
to
integrate
all
of
the
various
types
of
writing
styles
I
possessed
may
be
adventitious.
Doing
so
allowed
me
the
ability
to
write
more
clearly,
while
developing
a
more
consistent
writing
style
that
I
could
use
for
all
genres.
Therefore,
the
act
of
viewing
my
first
semester's
students
as
writers,
instead
of
merely
economic
students
that
had
to
write
a
paper,
helped
me
to
integrate
my
different
writing
styles
to
make
one
complete
writer
as
opposed
to
a
scientist
or
a
philosopher.
In
my
first
semester
as
a
WA,
one
of
my
major
concerns
was
gaining
respect.
However,
I
quickly
realized
gaining
respect
was
not
going
to
be
as
much
of
an
issue
as
I
had
originally
believed.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I
had
some
overachieving
seniors
that
would
request
to
meet
with
me
2,
3,
or
even
4
times
as
a
paper's
due
date
approached.
I
had
students
knocking
on
my
dorm
room
door
at
2
am
in
the
morning
the
day
their
papers
were
due,
officially
making
me
an
"on-call"
WA.
(Do
not
worry;
I
did
not
let
this
occur
often.)
Many
times
the
students
that
partook
in
these
behaviors
were
actually
revising
too
much.
I
was
once
told
in
high
school
that
performing
too
many
revisions
was
impossible.
From
watching
the
development
of
these
students'
papers,
I
realized
that
there
is
a
point
at
which
too
much
revision
occurs.
By
indefinitely
revising
minor
wording
choices
or
other
superficial
writing
characteristics,
these
students
were
losing
their
own
voice,
stressing
themselves
out,
and
taking
time
away
from
their
other
academic
tasks.
They
were
suffering
these
negative
consequences
without
achieving
a
better
quality
paper
or
better
grade
outcome.
Observing
these
students
behavior
made
me
examine
my
own
revision
process,
particularly
whether
the
revisions
I
made
were
truly
beneficial
to
my
paper.
Before
this
year,
I
was
under
the
impression
that
writing
can
always
be
improved.
However,
after
my
first
semester
as
a
WA,
I
realized
that
unless
you
have
new
information,
a
new
way
of
analyzing
the
old
information,
or
a
more
sensible
way
to
organize
your
argument,
the
revision
process
might
be
complete
and
useless
revisions
may
actually
harm
a
piece
of
writing.
Therefore,
this
experience
has
allowed
me
to
question
whether
I
am
spending
enough
time
making
the
important
revisions
in
my
papers,
the
revisions
that
require
more
thought
and
effort,
or
if
I
am
wasting
my
time
making
useless
revisions
just
to
say
that
I
revised
one
last
time.
Through
my
first
semester
WA
experience,
I
also
realized
that
professors
truly
are
available
to
help
you
and
in
most
cases
they
really
do
care
about
your
personal
and
academic
well
being.
This
realization
helped
me
to
become
a
better
writer
and
a
better
WA.
First
semester,
I
worked
with
Ed
Gamber,
a
professor
that
was
readily
available
to
help
both
his
students
and
me
with
the
revision
process.
The
students
often
shared
with
me
his
willingness
to
accommodate
them
and
assist
them
in
any
way
he
could.
Throughout
the
semester,
he
gave
me
a
significant
amount
of
feedback
and
at
the
end
of
the
semester
even
invited
me
to
his
house
for
dinner
to
meet
his
family.
In
addition
to
our
work
with
his
econ
class,
we
collaborated
to
organize
and
lead
a
hike
for
Marquis
Scholars.
His
willingness
to
interact
with
students
in
every
way
possible
showed
me
that
professors
really
are
available
and
here
to
help
students.
Before
my
first
semester
as
a
WA,
I
was
still
a
fairly
new
Lafayette
student,
and
therefore
was
still
unsure
as
to
what
responsibility
professors
had
to
the
students.
Because
of
my
WA
experience
during
the
first
semester,
my
writing
improved
because
I
am
no
longer
afraid
to
approach
my
professors
with
any
writing
concerns.
I
now
realize
that
most
professors
are
willing,
if
not
thrilled,
when
a
writer
approaches
them
for
advice.
I
learned
that
it
is
not
a
sign
of
weakness,
but
rather
a
sign
of
academic
curiosity,
to
ask
a
professor
for
extra
help.
Because
of
this,
I
have
been
able
to
improve
my
writing
and
achieve
better
grades
by
gearing
specific
papers
towards
the
wishes
of
the
professor.
When
I
learned
of
my
WA
assignment
for
the
second
semester,
I
had
mixed
emotions.
I
was
relieved
that
it
was
in
an
area
with
which
I
was
very
familiar,
but
it
was
also
with
a
professor
that
I
would
have
concurrently
for
another
class.
In
addition
to
having
her
for
another
class,
several
of
the
students
in
my
WA
class
would
be
my
classmates
in
another
class
taught
by
her.
I
was
to
be
a
WA
for
a
VaST
entitled
Bioterriorism
with
Professor
Caslake
who
I
had
previously
had
for
Bacteriology
and
Mycology
and
would
concurrently
have
for
Molecular
Biology.
It
seemed
like
the
perfect
match;
I
thought
I
knew
exactly
what
she
would
want
from
her
VaST
students.
That
was
until
I
realized
that
she
had
no
idea
what
she
wanted
from
the
students.
As
a
scientist,
she
had
little
formal
writing
training
and
was
not
sure
how
to
approach
teaching
a
mixed
discipline
class.
Throughout
the
semester,
my
role
as
a
WA
was
ever
changing
and
questionable.
At
times,
I
felt
like
I
was
asked
to
be
a
curriculum
developer,
grader,
and
a
confidant
to
both
the
students
and
the
professor.
I
learned
many
important
things
as
both
a
WA
and
a
writer
second
semester.
I
learned
that
the
best
thing
I
can
ever
do
as
a
WA
is
to
objectively
analyze
a
student's
writing,
addressing
their
concerns
and
helping
them
improve
the
writing
any
way
possible,
while
remaining
painfully
neutral
on
it's
quality.
I
developed
strategies
for
diffusing
complaints
about
the
professor
and
steering
the
conference
back
in
a
positive
direction.
Because
the
professor's
wishes
were
not
clear
to
the
students,
I
learned
the
importance
of
being
in
frequent
contact
with
the
professor.
I
was
forced
to
develop
strategies
for
lengthening
conferences
and
brainstorming
new
ideas
for
papers
since
none
of
the
papers
were
required
to
be
over
4
pages
long
(as
opposed
to
the
first
semester
during
which
I
met
with
students
4
times
each
for
10
page
papers
each
time).
During
the
second
semester
I
had
some
experiences
that
forced
me
to
change
my
outlook
on
being
a
WA.
From
a
few
students
in
particular
who
did
not
wish
to
be
in
the
WA
conferences,
I
realized
that
there
is
always
a
way
to
make
them
talk,
but
there
is
not
necessarily
always
a
way
to
help
them
if
they
do
not
wish
to
improve
their
writing.
Along
the
same
lines,
I
realized
that
I
should
not
be
so
stubborn
in
taking
advice
about
my
own
writing.
Often,
in
less
advice
came
from
a
professor,
I
found
myself
taking
peer
advice
less
seriously.
After
this
year,
I
realized
that
peer
advice
could
be
truly
helpful
in
improving
my
writing.
However,
I
also
realized
that
peer
advice
means
nothing
if
the
recipient
is
not
a
willing
participant.
While
I
have
not
found
myself
mimicking
writing
behaviors
that
I
see
in
students'
writing,
I
do
find
myself
looking
at
my
own
writing
in
the
same
fashion
as
I
view
other
students'
writing.
Being
a
WA
has
revised
my
revision
process.
In
the
past,
I
basically
had
no
revision
process,
with
the
exception
of
a
reread
to
find
wording
mistakes
or
grammatical
errors,
when
it
came
to
my
own
writing.
Now
I
print
out
my
paper
and
read
it
as
I
would
read
another
student's
paper.
I
have
found
that
by
doing
this,
I
locate
the
major
mistakes,
such
as
organizational
or
content
mistakes,
that
I
would
never
take
the
time
to
deal
with
in
the
past.
It
also
serves
as
practice
for
reading
students'
papers
with
similar
writing
styles
to
my
own.
In
terms
of
new
developments
with
my
own
writing,
this
year
proved
to
be
the
year
in
which
I
lost
my
need
for
rules.
In
addition
to
being
a
BS
major,
I
am
a
philosophy
minor.
My
philosophy
courses
allow
me
the
most
opportunity
to
develop
my
writing.
In
my
experience
with
philosophy
professors,
they
give
little
regard
to
"fluff'
and
style
but
instead,
they
focus
on
whether
thoughtful
ideas
are
presented
in
a
clear
fashion.
I
had
a
major
writing
leap
at
the
end
of
this
year.
The
final
assignment
for
my
Ethics
philosophy
class
was
a
4-page
paper
on
one
of
12
topics.
Each
of
the
topics
had
many
questions
that
were
to
be
answered.
After
carefully
reading
all
the
topics,
one
of
the
topics
inspired
me
to
attempt
something
I
never
would
have
done
before
this
year.
In
response
to
the
topic,
I
handed
in
a
total
of
5
pages.
The
first
page
was
my
title
page
in
which
I
wrote
my
name
with
the
last
name
of
the
philosopher
whose
voice
I
was
attempting
to
embody.
The
second
page
stated
"I,"
the
third
page
stated
"am,"
the
fourth
page
stated
"truth."
The
fifth
page
was
a
one-page
defense
of
my
three-word
paper.
In
the
defense,
I
attempted
to
answer
all
of
the
questions
by
laying
out
a
definite
statement
and
then
citing
works
and
passages
from
which
I
deduced
the
statement.
Each
of
the
statements
followed
the
form
of
the
philosopher's
autobiography.
Never
before
this
year
would
I
have
had
the
guts
to
turn
in
a
4-page
paper
that
consisted
of
3
words
and
a
one-page
defense
of
those
three
words.
I
received
an
A
on
the
paper
and
consequently
an
A-for
the
course.
From
this
experience,
I
realized
that
my
perception
of
writing
had
changed
from
a
form
of
communication
dictated
by
rules
and
algorithms
to
an
art
that
is
developed
as
a
way
to
convey
thoughts
and
ideas.
This
realization
has
helped
me
to
accept
and
appreciate
different
writing
styles
in
regard
to
other
people
and
has
freed
myself
to
take
risks
such
as
my
three-word
paper.
My
advice
to
new
WA's
-
be
an
overachiever
when
preparing
for
conferences.
Take
the
time
to
read
students
papers
carefully
and
think
about
various
ways
to
improve
the
paper,
other
than
simply
grammar.
Then
sit
back
and
be
an
underachiever
in
conferences.
Let
students
talk
about
their
writing.
If
students
are
willing
to
be
vocal,
listen
to
and
address
all
of
their
concerns
before
inteijecting
you
own
concerns
and
advice.
Remember
that
you
are
not
a
professor,
but
rather
a
trained
peer.
And
in
remembering
that
fact,
realize
that
it
is
extremely
important
to
interact
with
the
professor
as
often
as
possible
in
order
to
help
the
students
to
the
best
of
your
ability.
Overall,
both
you
and
the
students
will
get
out
of
the
WA
program
whatever
you
are
willing
to
put
into
it.
