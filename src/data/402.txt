W.A.
Narrative
Summer
2003
Writing
As
A
WA,
Junior
Year
When
I
first
approached
this
assignment
I
thought
to
myself,
NI
only
had
one
writing
course
this
past
year,
what
will
I
be
able
to
say
about
my
history
as
a
writer
in
the
past
year?O
After
much
careful
consideration
and
analysis
I
realized
that
the
number
of
college-determined
writing
courses
I
had
didnOt
mean
I
wasnOt
writing
in
my
other
classes.
I
re-evaluated
the
work
I
had
done
in
all
my
classes
and
realized
I
had
written
in
many
different
disciplines
and
had
grown
a
lot
this
past
year.
Also,
the
work
I
did
with
my
WA
classes
and
outside
of
school
have
continued
to
broaden
my
scope
of
writing
knowledge.
My
experience
as
a
writer
and
as
a
WA
has
continued
to
shape
me
in
the
breadth
and
depth
in
which
I
was
writing.
As
a
psychology
major,
most
of
the
writing
I
did
in
the
past
year
was
for
psychology
courses,
such
as
Child
Development
and
Advanced
Social
Psychology.
In
my
Child
Development
class
I
had
the
opportunity
to
get
extra
credit
by
volunteering
at
the
local
daycare
center.
In
order
to
receive
the
extra
credit,
I
had
to
analyze
the
behaviors
of
the
children
in
the
form
of
a
journal.
I
recorded
the
actions
of
the
children
in
a
journal
after
meeting
with
them
each
week
and
then
incorporated
elements
of
the
course
into
my
analysis.
The
assignment
for
the
journal
was
rather
vague
compared
to
assignments
IOve
had
in
the
past.
Most
of
the
assignments
IOd
had
before
were
very
structured
and
the
journal
assignment
was
very
open-ended.
I
began
to
work
on
the
journals
the
same
as
I
did
other
assignments;
I
did
the
required
research,
outlined
my
ideas,
and
began
to
write
the
first
draft.
Because
of
the
vague
nature
of
the
assignment
I
took
my
own
advice
that
I
give
to
confused
and
wandering
WA
students;
I
asked
to
meet
with
my
professor
about
the
assignment.
She
was
kind
enough
to
look
at
my
progress,
answer
my
questions,
and
give
me
some
advice
about
my
work.
It
was
very
helpful
to
me
to
have
some
extra
guidance
on
the
vague
assignment.
Using
the
professorOs
advice
I
did
some
extra
research
and
analysis,
redrafted,
and
polished
my
final
journal
to
turn
in.
I
was
still
unsure
of
the
outcome
of
my
work
but
the
professor
asked
to
keep
my
journals
as
an
example
for
future
classes.
I
took
that
as
a
sign
of
my
success
in
decoding
and
understanding
the
vague
assignment.
The
journal
assignment
was
very
different
compared
to
most
of
the
other
assignments
IOve
had
in
the
past;
it
was
still
formal
writing,
but
the
process
was
completely
different.
I
had
to
dig
a
little
deeper
to
create
what
I
felt
was
a
product
up
to
my
own
personal
standards
of
writing.
I
feel
that
if
I
hadnOt
gone
the
extra
steps
that
my
work
would
not
have
been
as
clear
and
I
would
not
have
fully
completed
the
assignment.
I
feel
that
my
experience
working
with
writers
who
have
been
faced
with
similar
confusion
and
vague
assignments
helped
me
to
overcome
my
own
roadblock.
ItOs
sometimes
hard
to
take
your
own
advice
or
even
to
realize
that
you
could
use
help,
but
I
think
that
because
I
have
encountered
this
situation
so
many
times,
I
was
able
to
solve
it
easier.
IOve
noticed
that
many
times
when
students
are
trying
to
decode
a
tough
or
vague
assignment
that
they
just
shut
down
and
donOt
try
anything,
instead
of
starting
somewhere
and
taking
small
steps
to
completion.
I
also
felt
that
my
experience
with
a
new
style
of
writing
helped
to
widen
my
experiences
as
a
writer
and
the
ways
I
can
relate
to
young
writers
in
the
same
position.
My
experience
with
analytic
journal
writing
was
only
one
of
my
experiences
writing
with
psychology
this
past
year.
My
only
real
NwritingO
class,
as
classified
by
the
college,
was
Advanced
Social
Psychology,
a
300-level
psychology
lab
course
that
required
me
to
write
weekly
response
papers
about
in-class
readings
and
three
full
lab
reports.
The
weekly
response
papers,
though
only
two
pages
long,
were
some
of
the
most
challenging
pieces
of
writing
I
had
over
the
entire
year.
The
professor
put
a
two
page
limit
on
the
papers
that
forced
me
as
a
writer
to
make
my
arguments
concise
and
well
planned
out.
For
longer
assignments
it
is
either
hard
to
reach
the
page
minimum
or
the
writer
is
able
to
ramble
on
and
go
off
on
tangents
without
realizing
it.
The
two
page
limit
left
me
often
times
re-reading
what
I
had
written
trying
to
find
ways
to
cut
parts
out
or
make
my
argument
shorter.
It
once
again
presented
me
with
a
new
style
of
writing
where
I
had
to
write
out
of
my
comfort
zone.
The
short
response
papers
helped
me
to
learn
how
to
tailor
my
arguments
and
focus
the
main
points
of
my
response,
which
I
feel
is
a
very
important
skill
to
have
as
a
writer.
I
think
that
short
responses
will
be
very
pertinent
in
Nreal
worldO
writing,
where
a
9
page
paper
is
unnecessary
when
2
pages
can
suffice.
Also,
having
more
skills
and
abilities
as
a
writer
allows
me
to
write
more
freely
and
draw
on
these
different
skills
to
tailor
my
writing
style.
The
more
significant
part
of
my
Social
Psychology
class
were
the
lengthy
lab
reports,
often
20
pages
or
more
each
lab
report.
The
lab
reports
required
me
to
call
on
another
set
of
skills
because
it
required
me
to
follow
APA
style
in
addition
to
writing
clearly
and
concisely.
APA
format
is
very
specific
in
terms
of
how
each
section
is
written
and
worded.
The
way
in
which
I
pre-wrote
and
wrote
my
lab
reports
presented
a
new
challenge
for
me.
The
typical
outline
style
pre-writing
I
used
for
my
other
classes
would
have
left
me
with
insufficient
reports.
I
did,
however,
write
in
the
same
fashion
in
terms
of
drafting
and
revising.
I
found
this
very
important
with
the
lab
report,
to
make
sure
that
I
was
saying
what
I
wanted
in
the
clearest,
most
concise
manner.
Once
during
this
past
year,
I
was
presented
with
a
lab
report
while
on
drop-in
duty.
I
found
that
the
way
I
read
the
lab
and
how
I
approached
my
comments
was
greatly
molded
by
my
experience
in
Social
Psychology.
I
felt
that
my
experience
with
the
scientific
style
of
writing
and
my
efforts
in
perfecting
my
labs
allowed
me
to
understand
better
where
the
concerns
of
the
student
were
coming
from.
It
would
have
been
tough
for
me
to
read
constructively
and
effectively
if
I
hadnOt
had
the
experience
myself
earlier
in
the
year.
Also,
I
feel
that
my
experience
in
lab
writing
will
be
useful
Nreal-lifeO
experience
in
whatever
my
future
job
ends
up
being.
My
ability
to
write
clearly
and
technically
in
memos
or
reports
will
be
much
better
as
a
result
of
lab
writing.
I
had
fewer
opportunities
to
write
during
the
second
semester,
but
I
was
still
presented
with
various
challenges
in
the
writing
I
did.
In
my
Cultural
Anthropology
class
I
had
to
write
two
essays;
they
were
ethnographic
studies,
the
first
about
of
a
group
of
people
and
the
second
on
a
specific
ritual.
I
had
to
pull
experiences
from
my
everyday
life
and
analyze
them
in
a
completely
different
way,
using
new
terminology
and
a
different
thought
process.
I
found
myself
relying
more
on
my
notes
from
class
that
explained
the
terms,
ideas,
and
processes
I
would
need
more
than
turning
to
outside
research
to
help
me.
These
essays
were
challenging
because
anthropology
was
a
completely
new
discipline
to
me,
though
it
has
some
similarities
to
psychology,
I
was
starting
completely
from
scratch.
I
used
my
resources,
including
the
wisdom
of
my
professor,
to
their
fullest
extent
to
produce
two
solid
ethnographic
studies.
My
other
class
that
required
me
to
do
a
good
amount
of
writing
was
a
music
elective
course
studying
the
musical
history
of
America.
Once
again,
the
writing
was
not
typical
intro-body-conclusion
style
essays.
For
my
first
paper
I
wrote
a
response
to
a
musical
event
I
attended.
I
learned
a
valuable
lesson
from
that
experience
about
expectations.
I
wrote
my
response
in
a
more
casual
manner
but
the
professor
expected
something
more
formal
and
polished.
The
differences
in
style
did
not
affect
my
grade
or
the
quality
of
my
ideas,
but
did
make
me
realize
the
importance
of
understanding
the
expectations
of
the
professor.
It
is
sometimes
assumed
that
our
WA
students
all
understand
their
assignment
or
assumed
that
the
professor
of
the
class
was
very
clear
about
his/her
expectations;
however,
this
is
often
not
the
case
and
it
is
always
important
as
a
WA
to
double
check
with
the
professor
what
his/her
expectations
are,
convey
them
to
the
students
as
you
work
with
them,
and
double
check
that
the
students
are
clear.
My
experience
was
nominal
because
it
had
not
been
made
totally
clear
to
me
and
I
was
not
penalized
because
of
the
style
of
my
paper;
however,
it
was
a
good
reminder
of
something
to
be
aware
of
when
working
with
a
class
of
students
and
as
a
writer.
The
rest
of
the
writing
I
did
for
that
class
was
all
in
the
form
of
take-home
essays
as
part
of
our
exams.
We
were
given
questions
and
had
to
craft
well
thought
out,
complete
answers
to
the
questions
that
fit
within
a
certain
number
of
pages.
Luckily,
I
had
done
take-home
essays
in
previous
classes
and
had
some
idea
of
how
to
approach
them.
A
take-home
essay
can
be
a
very
daunting
task
when
you
think
about
how
much
of
your
grade
it
effects.
However,
I
used
the
method
I
had
used
before
and
it
proved
to
be
just
as
effective.
I
began
by
carefully
choosing
the
questions
I
wanted
to
respond
to,
because
if
I
couldnOt
think
of
some
information
off
the
top
of
my
head
to
answer
it,
I
knew
that
I
wouldnOt
have
enough
interest
to
answer
the
question
completely.
Then,
for
each
question
I
outlined
my
response
and
began
to
collect
quotes,
page
numbers
to
paraphrase,
citations,
and
examples.
I
then
drafted
and
revised
like
I
do
with
any
essay.
Do
to
the
professorOs
request,
I
couldnOt
bring
my
take-home
essay
to
drop-in
for
proofreading
and
some
suggestions.
Therefore,
I
made
sure
to
check
through
it
very
clearly
and
read
it
several
times
myself.
It
gave
me
a
lot
of
faith
in
my
ability
to
proof
my
own
work
because
they
turned
out
well.
Although
I
may
not
actually
read
take-home
essays
for
WA
students,
I
can
at
least
give
some
good
advice
to
students
faced
with
similar
assignments.
Once
again,
my
experience
with
a
new
style
of
writing
has
given
me
a
different
perspective
and
broadened
my
abilities.
The
two
classes
I
worked
with
as
a
WA
also
broadened
my
experiences
with
different
styles
of
writing.
In
the
fall
semester
I
was
the
WA
for
an
FYS
that
was
focused
on
the
concepts
of
civil
engineering.
The
students
were
given
many
unconventional
assignments,
such
as
writing
a
childrenOs
story
or
an
architectural
review.
It
was
a
learning
experience
for
myself
and
the
students
at
the
same
time
in
many
ways,
we
both
had
to
adapt
to
the
assignments
and
interpret
the
professorOs
expectations.
Although
I
did
not
write
the
assignments
myself,
I
did
have
a
very
thorough
experience
with
the
various
styles.
Also,
I
had
never
really
worked
in
the
realm
of
engineering
and
very
technical
writing.
It
was
not
a
big
problem
as
a
reader
because
the
students
were
all
new
to
it
as
well,
but
I
did
learn
a
lot
about
the
style.
During
the
second
semester
I
worked
as
the
WA
for
a
200-level
math/statistics
class.
As
a
part
of
their
grade,
they
were
required
to
complete
a
statistical
analysis
and
report
for
an
outside
client.
I
worked
with
the
students
in
groups
to
make
their
memos
and
reports
clear.
I
found
this
assignment
more
challenging
first
because
I
had
to
work
with
the
students
in
a
group.
Often
times
the
students
had
divided
up
the
reports
and
did
not
know
what
each
other
had
written,
this
made
the
reports
and,
often
times,
the
conferences
disjointed
as
we
all
tried
to
connect
and
discuss
the
sections.
The
writing
was
more
similar
to
the
writing
I
had
encountered
in
the
FYS
I
worked
with
the
previous
semester.
As
the
summer
drew
nearer
I
also
had
to
start
looking
for
summer
work
and
a
fall
internship.
For
this
task
I
had
to
write
cover
letters
and
revise
my
resume.
That
experience
was
another
way
in
which
my
scope
of
writing
continued
to
expand.
I
had
to
think
completely
differently
and
consulted
my
dad,
a
seasoned
businessman,
about
wording,
style,
and
length
of
my
cover
letters.
Although
not
many
writers
approach
drop-in
for
help
with
such
things,
itOs
good
to
have
some
idea
because
that
is
a
task
most
students
will
be
faced
with
very
soon.
As
a
word
of
advice
to
all
new
WAOs,
I
would
remind
them
to
keep
an
open
mind
when
faced
with
new
types
of
writing,
as
the
writer
or
as
the
WA.
It
can
only
help
to
give
you
a
clearer,
more
educated
perspective
when
helping
other
writers.
Many
WAs
find
that
their
best
advice
comes
from
how
theyOve
dealt
with
different
types
of
assignments
themselves.
If
I
only
knew
how
to
write
lab
reports,
then
I
wouldnOt
be
of
very
much
help
to
someone
in
a
poetry
analysis
class.
I
canOt
say
IOm
a
master
of
all
the
styles
IOve
encountered,
but
IOm
always
ready
to
learn
and
incorporate
things
into
my
range
of
abilities.
Over
the
past
year,
the
different
types
of
assignments
IOve
encountered
have
prepared
me
to
deal
with
new
styles
of
writing
and
assignments
both
as
a
writer
and
as
a
WA.
I
have
formulated
some
new
methods
of
pre-writing
and
organization,
while
revising
some
of
my
old
methods.
I
feel
confident
that
my
experiences
will
give
me
a
wider
range
of
advice
to
offer
to
new
students.
I
also
feel
that
my
classes
and
activities
this
year
will
further
my
knowledge.
I
will
have
more
experience
with
psychology
lab
reports,
both
as
a
writer
and
as
a
PLA
working
with
new
psychology
students
trying
to
deal
with
a
complete
change
of
style.
Also,
I
will
have
independent
research,
an
internship,
and
experience
working
in
the
Technology
Clinic
that
will
allow
me
to
write
more
thoroughly,
technically,
and
professionally.
I
look
forward
to
the
experiences,
and
even
challenges,
that
I
will
face
this
coming
year
and
feel
confident
that
my
works
as
a
writer
and
WA
in
the
past
year
have
prepared
me
well
for
it.
