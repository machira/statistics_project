W.A.
Assignment
The
Development
of
My
Writing
For
as
long
as
I
can
remember,
I
have
loved
to
read.
As
a
child,
I
would
read
everything
that
I
could
get
my
hands
on
and
if
the
writing
was
too
challenging
for
me
to
read,
I
would
talk
my
parents
into
reading
it
to
me.
My
early
favorite
authors
included
Shell
Silverstein
and
Bill
Peete,
but
soon
I
learned
to
cherish
the
magic
pen
of
Roald
Dahl,
and
read
as
many
of
his
stories
as
I
could
find.
This
early
love
affair
with
the
written
word
was
the
genesis
of
my
own
writing
career
as
I
often
dreamed
of
the
day
when
I,
myself,
would
be
an
author
and
have
my
own
book
published.
While
I
have
given
up
the
idea
of
becoming
an
author,
my
infatuation
with
publishing
my
work
is
a
common
theme
throughout
my
writing
development.
Throughout
elementary
school,
my
teachers
devoted
a
lot
of
class
time
to
writing.
I
remember
that
I
had
to
learn
how
to
write
haiku's
just
about
every
year
from
second
grade
through
seventh
and
that
we
had
continual
conferences
with
the
teacher
to
discuss
what
we
were
working
on.
However,
my
most
prominent
memory
occurred
in
second
grade
when
I
produced
a
very
long
(about
ten
pages)
story
about
a
snowman
that
came
to
life.
In
one
of
the
multiple
conferences
I
had
with
Mrs.
Theirs,
my
teacher
at
the
time,
about
this
particular
story
she
mentioned
the
possibility
of
submitting
it
to
"Fine
Lines",
an
annual
magazine
filled
with
students'
pictures,
stories,
and
poems.
I
was
so
thrilled
by
the
notion
of
having
my
story
appear
in
the
pages
of
"Fine
Lines"
that
I
dreamt
about
it
for
nearly
a
week.
My
excitement
turned
to
heartbreak
howeve^when
I
found
out
that
it
would
not
be
published
due
to
its
length.
From
third
grade
on,
I
made
sure
that
I
had
at
least
one
work
in
every
"Fine
Lines"
by
submitting
several
at
a
time,
so
that
even
if
one
or
more
got
rejected,
the
odds
were
still
in
my
favor
that
at
least
one
would
be
accepted.
And
every
time
the
magazine
came
out,
I
was
exstatic
to
see
my
name
printed
in
the
table
of
contents.
One
of
the
defining
moments
in
the
development
of
my
writing
occurred
in
third
grade
when
my
family
bought
our
first
computer.
This
was
especially
significant
because
my
penmanship
was,
and
is
awful,
and
the
computer
allowed
me
a
means
to
express
my
thoughts
on
paper
in
a
legible
way.
It
also
introduced
me
to
the
wonders
of
spell
check,
a
device
that
I
have
grown
to
rely
on.
During
fifth
and
sixth
grades,
my
writing
showed
great
improvement,
largely
due
to
the
work
of
two
English
teachers,
Mr.
Grosky
and
Mr.
Buckly.
These
two
men
helped
to
foster
my
love
of
books
by
encouraging
me
to
challenge
myself
with
more
difficult
works
than
I
was
accustomed,
such
as
Captains
Courageous
by
Rudyard
Kipling
and
Stephen
Crane's
The
Red
Badge
of
Courage.
Exposure
to
this
sort
of
literature
helped
to
progress
my
writing
development.
In
addition
to
challenging
my
reading,
these
two
teachers
required
much
more
out
of
papers
than
any
previous
teacher.
For
book
reports,
they
demanded
that
their
students
give
them
more
than
the
standard
plot
outline
and
expected
reports
to
be
inquisitive.
Students
were
not
permitted
to
regurgitate
the
story
and
instead
had
to
explain
what
message,
if
any,
the
author
was
attempting
to
convey.
This
experience
was
my
first
exposure
to
writing
analytically.
In
Mr.
Buckly's
class,
my
ability
to
write
creatively
also
improved
significantly.
He
was
the
most
critical
teacher
that
I
had
ever
had.
For
most
of
the
year,
I
worked
on
a
fantasy
story
involving
two
contemporary
teenagers
who,
through
a
time
warp,
traveled
back
in
time
to
medieval
England.
Mr.
Buckly's
redundant
criticism
was
the
lack
of
any
real
character
development.
It
took
me
just
about
the
whole
year,
but
eventually
I
was
able
to
develop
the
characters
to
the
point
of
Mr.
Buckly's
satisfaction.
Since
his
tutelage,
not
one
teacher
has
criticized
my
characters
for
being
underdeveloped.
The
most
important
thing
that
I
took
out
of
this
period,
however,
was
that
writing
was
a
very
enjoyable
way
to
express
myself.
As
I
underwent
the
tough
adolescent
times
of
seventh
and
eighth
grades,
I
realized
the
therapeutic
nature
of
writing,
and
used
it
to
search
within
myself
while
I
went
through
my
rebellious
and
self-alienating
stages.
At
the
time,
I
was
writing
primarily
poetry
in
free
verse
because
its
unrestrained
nature
seemed
to
fit
with
my
combustible
emotions.
When
I
look
over
these
writings
now,
they
seem
to
document
my
rite
of
passage
into
adulthood.
In
hopes
of
polishing
my
poetry,
I
took
a
creative
writing
course
the
summer
before
my
freshman
year
of
High
School,
where
I
learned
some
basic
poetic
forms,
such
as
sonnets
and
blues.
This
experience
broadened
my
writing
by
proving
the
importance
other
poetic
styles
aside
from
free
verse.
I
found
that
some
of
the
more
structured
styles
actually
enabled
me
to
convey
certain
emotions
more
intensely
than
could
be
accounted
for
by
free
verse.
At
the
end
of
the
summer,
our
class
published
a
journal
that
I
was
eager
to
have
as
many
of
my
poems
printed
in
as
I
could.
I
was
so
excited
with
the
finished
project,
which
featured
five
of
my
poems,
that
I
showed
it
to
any
family
member
or
friend
who
came
near.
Although,
I
have
not
published
anything
creative
since
that
class,
the
thrill
of
distributing
my
writing
to
an
audience,
regardless
of
its
size,
stayed
with
me
through
high
school.
I
joined
"The
Spectrum",
the
school
newspaper,
at
the
beginning
of
my
sophomore
year.
Initially,
I
desired
to
write
for
the
news
department
but
a
disagreement
with
the
news
editor
prompted
me
to
switch
over
to
the
entertainment
section.
Writing
for
that
section
was
extremely
enjoyable
because
it
permitted
me
to
write
about
one
of
my
primary
loves-
music.
Reviews
were
much
harder
to
write
than
I
had
expected,
however,
because
the
reviewer
is
asked
to
translate
relatively
abstract
musical
expressions
into
easy
to
understand
language.
Attempting
this
task
regularly
greatly
impacted
my
analytical
development.
It
was
also
during
my
sophomore
year
that
I
was
forced
to
explore
the
uses
of
the
thesis
statement.
My
history
teacher,
Mr.
Donaldson,
required
our
class
to
write
three
papers
during
the
year.
The
first
two
papers
were
reactions
to
books;
Mr.
Donaldson
demanded
that
these
papers
be
very
critical
and
thorough.
For
example,
my
first
paper
was
a
reaction
to
a
biography
about
Daniel
Webster
and
I
had
to
not
only
analyze
Webster's
role
in
history
but
also
examine
any
biases
that
may
have
influenced
the
author's
writing.
The
purpose
of
these
first
two
papers
was
to
prepare
us
for
a
final
twelve-page
research
paper,
which
would
be
my
first
exposure
to
a
true
research
paper.
I
chose
to
look
at
how
railroads
affected
the
development
of
the
western
half
of
the
country
following
the
Civil
War.
I
was
fairly
happy
with
the
product
I
turned
in,
but
my
teacher
tore
it
to
shreds.
Everything
from
the
extent
of
the
research
to
the
thesis
was
criticized.
This
type
of
feedback
was
shocking
and
caused
me
to
doubt
my
ability
to
write
intelligently.
To
make
things
worse,
about
a
week
after
I
got
my
history
paper
back,
my
English
teacher
handed
back
harsh
criticisms
of
my
analysis
of
A
Raison
In
the
Sun.
As
a
result
of
these
two
reactions,
I
ended
my
sophomore
year
with
my
tail
between
my
legs,
uncertain
about
my
ability
to
convey
coherent
thoughts
onto
paper.
Things
did
not
start
out
any
better
the
next
year,
either.
My
new
English
teacher
had
unusual
demands
for
the
writing
passed
in
to
her.
For
example,
we
were
forbidden
from
using
"to
be"
verbs
for
the
entire
year.
Also,
the
majority
of
our
writing
had
to
be
done
during
class
time
in
a
computer
lab.
Although
at
first
it
was
very
hard
to
adjust
to
all
of
her
demands,
she
was
responsible
for
strengthening
my
writing
a
great
deal.
In
her
class,
I
was
unable
to
rely
on
words
such
as
"am"
and
"was"
and
instead,
had
to
use
more
creative
verbs.
Also,
by
writing
primarily
in
the
computer
lab,
I
became
conditioned
to
writing
under
stressful
situations.
The
learning
process
during
my
junior
year
did
not
end
in
my
English
class.
There
was
a
fifteen-page
research
paper
on
an
issue
relevant
to
the
past
hundred
years
in
US
society
assigned
for
my
History
class.
My
paper
analyzed
the
role
that
the
television
media
has
had
in
contributing
to
public
opinion
of
foreign
affairs,
specifically
dealing
with
the
differences
between
the
television
coverage
of
the
Vietnam
conflict
and
of
the
Gulf
War.
This
paper
was
a
tremendous
learning
experience,
because
although
I
did
extensive
research,
my
thesis
statement
was
not
well
organized.
This
crucial
mistake
prepared
me
well
for
future
attempts.
This
experience
got
me
ready
for
a
senior
year
in
which
I
had
to
write
a
number
of
research
papers,
the
most
significant
one
being
for
International
Relations.
I
elected
to
examine
the
roots
of
the
conflict
in
Rwanda
and
Burundi.
Since
this
topic
was
so
current,
I
had
to
utilize
a
number
of
contemporary
sources
such
as
magazines
and
television
reports,
unlike
earlier
reports,
where
I
relied
primarily
on
books
for
information.
My
previous
research
attempts
provided
me
with
the
experience
necessary
to
produce
a
much
stronger
and
coherent
paper
this
time
around.
In
my
senior
English
class,
I
learned
to
be
creative
in
all
my
writing
attempts,
something
that
has
proved
to
be
invaluable.
My
teacher,
who
incidentally
was
one
of
my
favorites
in
high
school,
encouraged
his
students
to
break
out
of
conventions
when
writing
both
creatively
and
analytically.
In
this
class,
I
learned
the
value
of
attacking
problems
from
different
angles
than
are
standard.
This
skill
was
extremely
important
through
my
first
year
of
college,
because
not
only
is
it
more
enjoyable
to
write
an
analytical
paper
that
has
some
sort
of
edge
to
it,
most
professors
have
seemed
to
appreciate
attempts
at
doing
things
that
are
less
conventional
as
well.
When
I
graduated
from
high
school
I
really
did
not
know
what
I
would
encounter
in
the
upcoming
years
at
Lafayette,
except
that
I
would
have
a
lot
of
writing
assignments.
I
thought
that
I
was
probably
adequately
prepared
for
what
I
would
encounter
because
people
from
my
high
school
have
tended
to
do
fairly
well
at
college;
I
think
I
just
assumed
that
my
writing
would
be
"okay,"
but
I
was
reluctant
to
think
too
much
about
it.
It
has
turned
out
that
I
was
right
about
having
a
lot
of
writing
assigned
and
that
my
high
school
has
seemed
to
have
prepared
me
well.
On
my
first
significant
college
writing
assignment,
I
followed
my
senior
English
teacher's
advice
and
took
a
creative
angle
on
a
paper
about
modem
day
American
pilgrims.
In
this
paper
for
my
first
year
writing
seminar,
I
compared
certain
visitors
of
the
Vietnam
War
Memorial
with
ancient
pilgrims
to
Rome.
My
professor
praised
the
paper
and
the
angle
I
choose.
This
positive
feedback
gave
me
a
huge
boost
of
confidence
and
encouraged
me
to
continue
to
be
creative
with
future
assignments.
The
most
positive
writing
experience
at
college
thus
far,
however,
came
in
an
Anthropology
course
that
I
took
in
the
first
semester.
My
professor
required
a
twenty-
page
paper,
to
be
done
with
partners,
handed
in
at
the
end
of
the
semester.
The
partner
I
ended
up
with,
turned
out
to
be
an
unmotivated
junior
and
I
wrote
nearly
the
entire
paper
myself.
All
the
extra
work
that
I
had
to
put
into
the
paper
to
counterbalance
the
lack
of
effort
on
my
partners
behalf,
made
the
"A"
we
received
feel
that
much
better.
After
that
moment
I
took
on
the
attitude
that
I
could
write
anything,
no
matter
how
hard
the
assignment,
as
long
as
I
put
my
full
effort
into
it.
My
writing
is
in
the
midst
of
improving
drastically.
After
just
one
year
of
college
I
can
see
a
marked
change,
for
the
better,
in
the
way
that
I
am
able
to
communicate
ideas
and
thoughts
on
paper.
I
have
no
reason
to
doubt
that
this
will
continue
to
occur
as
I
progress
through
college,
which
makes
me
very
optimistic
about
the
future.
I
see
the
ability
to
communicate
as
increasingly
important
in
today's
information
society
and
desire
to
continue
to
improve
my
own
abilities
to
correspond
with
the
rest
of
the
world.
I
also
continue
to
look
forward
to
any
opportunities
that
may
come
up
to
publish
my
work.
