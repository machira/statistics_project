Writing
Associate
Summer
Assignment
When
I
wrote
my
essay
to
become
a
WA,
I
placed
a
large
amount
of
emphasis
on
the
lack
of
self-confidence
I
had
in
my
writing.
In
my
own
experience
I
have
found
that
the
large
majority
of
individuals
either
have
no
confidence
in
their
writing
ability
while
others
might
display
too
much.
With
past
experiences
weighing
heavily
in
my
decision
of
which
end
of
the
spectrum
I
figured
in,
I
concluded
that
I
represented
somewhat
of
a
happy
medium.
In
last
year's
WA
summer
assignment,
I
mainly
wrote
about
the
horrible
experiences
I
have
had
with
writing
and
how
these
all
have
led
up
to
my
present
status
as
a
writer.
Yet,
I
still
do
not
consider
myself
a
good
writer.
What
I
have
discovered,
however,
is
that
there
is
a
large
difference
in
my
views
of
what
a
"good
writer"
is.
The
difference
lies
in
the
fact
that
I
have
figured
out
why
I
do
not
consider
myself
a
good
writer.
I
held
plenty
of
conversations
with
the
professors
I
WA'ed
for
concerning
what
a
"good
writer"
is.
Of
course,
the
definitions
varied.
At
the
risk
of
being
smart
enough
to
actually
utilize
something
I
have
read,
Bartholomae
actually
makes
a
valid
point
in
his
all-too-familiar
"Inventing
the
University".
The
definition
of
a
good
writer
is
based
loosely
on
some
concrete
aspects.
The
knowledge
of
sentence
structure,
for
instance,
is
something
that
is
most
likely
non-negotiable.
A
jumble
of
words
may
have
potential
to
become
great
but
until
they
make
sense,
they
undoubtedly
will
not
be
impressive.
I
have
found
the
key
to
being
a
successful
writer
is
believing
ni
what
you
are
writing.
And
of
course,
writing
to
fit
the
university.
Instead
of
being
a
good
writer,
I
have
come
to
the
realization
that
I
have
developed
a
decent
understanding
of
how
a
paper
should
come
together.
This
understanding
includes
knowing
that
sometimes
it's
ok
to
write
a
body
of
a
paper
instead
of
sitting
for
hours
trying
to
come
up
with
a
thesis.
And
I
still
fall
victim
to
the
phenomenon
of
using
large,
impressive
words
strung
together
instead
of
a
simple
sentence,
which
is
more
times
than
none
more
effective.
A
factor
that
was
key
in
my
fight
of
this
addiction
was
my
accidental
spilling
of
water
on
my
keyboard,
rendering
the
thesaurus
key
useless.
While
grasping
to
some
last
minute
miracles,
I
entered
my
sophomore
year
still
hoping
to
be
a
Biology
major.
I
kept
making
excuses
for
myself,
thinking
that
my
first
year
was
just
a
slump,
that
once
I
was
focused,
I
could
do
this
bio
thing
.
Yet,
with
some
of
those
humanity
requirements
to
fulfill,
I
enrolled
myself
into
Literary
Questions.
Inteijected
with
some
newfound
confidence,
having
been
entrusted
as
a
WA,
I
figured
that
this
class
would
be
easy.
And
like
the
previous
year,
I
struggled
once
again
with
the
biology
courses
I
had
foolishly
decided
to
take.
And
although
Literary
Questions
was
not
exactly
the
easiest
course
I
had
ever
taken,
it
certainly
looked
better
than
realizing
whether
I
liked
it
or
not,
I
was
going
to
be
spending
the
entire
semester
sitting
in
Kunkel
with
my
genetics
professor.
Right
around
the
time
that
I
felt
like
I
spent
more
time
in
a
certain
professors
office
than
in
my
own
dorm
room,
my
literary
questions
class
received
an
assignment
that
required
several
out-of-class
meetings
with
the
professor.
It
was
when
I
was
meeting
with
these
two
professors,
who
specialize
in
complete
opposite
areas,
that
I
encountered
situations
that
were
eerily
similar.
Yet
the
outcome
to
both
situations
made
me
truly
realize
what
a
WA
is,
what
my
writing
is,
and
more
importantly
what
"good
writing"
is.
Through
talk
about
Punnett
squares,
replication,
and
other
genetic
terms
that
still
make
no
sense
to
me,
it
was
revealed
that
I
was
a
WA.
My
genetics
professor
seemed
impressed
and
asked
me
more
about
the
job
and
my
writing.
One
of
the
few
jobs
in
life
that
I
have
actually
enjoyed
doing,
I
talked
about
the
WA
program
with
enthusiasm.
And
although
this
certain
professor
affirmed
my
fears
that
I
was
heading
in
the
wrong
direction
with
the
question
why
aren't
you
an
English
major?
,
(which
in
conjunction
with
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
an
degree
in
English?
could
generate
a
completely
separate
paper),
I
was
encouraged
with
her
praise
and
enthusiasm
when
she
found
that
I
was
a
WA.
This
confidence
was
extremely
short-lived
when
I
went
to
go
meet
with
my
other
professor.
After
arriving
a
couple
minutes
late
to
our
scheduled
meetings,
I
apologized,
explaining
that
I
had
just
had
a
WA
meeting
that
had
run
longer
than
expected.
The
professor
than
asked
what
other
class
I
was
taking
that
had
a
WA.
When
explaining
that
I
was
actually
the
WA,
she
promptly
responded
with
you're
a
WA?
With
the
thought
in
mind
that
this
particular
individual
that
was
questioning
my
status
as
a
WA
had
read
my
papers
and
other
assignments
that
I
had
handed
in
throughout
the
semester,
I
became
very
hurt
and
very
surprised.
With
this
hurtful
comment
in
mind,
which
I
thought
clearly
insinuated
that
I
was
not
good
enough
to
be
a
WA,
I
prepared
myself
to
get
fired
from
the
WA
program
upon
completion
of
my
first
semester.
Although
another
professor
had
only
a
day
before
instilled
confidence
in
my
ability
to
be
a
WA,
clearly
she
knew
nothing
about
the
subject.
Clearly
the
opinion
of
an
English
professor
overrides
that
of
a
Biology
professor.
But
coupled
with
my
work
with
my
assigned
class
through
the
WA
program,
I
realized
one
of
the
most
common
misconceptions
about
the
WA
program,
particularly
the
people
involved
in
it.
This
is
that
all
WA's
must
be
excellent
writers.
In
response
to
this
belief,
I
must
say
that
the
majority
of
WA's
are
excellent
writers.
After
reading
some
of
the
sample
essays
from
last
years
veteran
WA's,
this
is
clearly
evident
to
me.
You
know
that
someone
is
a
good
writer
when
you
read
something
and
think
to
yourself
that
you
wish
you
could
write
like
that
or
find
yourself
copying
that
particular
writing
style.
I
am
not
disillusioned
enough
to
believe
that
I
fall
into
that
category.
My
writing
needs
so
much
work
that
I
often
feel
overwhelmed.
This
is
how
I
have
found
that
you
do
not
have
to
be
a
good
writer
to
be
a
WA.
Instead
I
feel
as
if
WA's
have
a
certain
understanding
of
how
a
paper
should
come
together.
One
might
counteract
that
if
someone
understands
how
a
paper
should
be
written,
then
that
consists
of
a
good
writer.
However,
I
believe
that
I
understand,
mainly
through
the
WA
training,
that
I
have
a
good
understanding
of
how
a
paper
should
be
written,
and
I
still
consider
myself
very,
very
far
from
being
an
excellent
or
established
writer.
Although
not
a
very
strong
argument
to
this
counteraction,
I
believe
that
it
is
the
only
thing
that
keeps
me
from
becoming
overly
confident.
And
although
some
might
think
that
I
have
not
reached
any
new
conclusions
from
this
past
year,
considering
that
fact
that
I
still
do
not
consider
myself
a
good
writer,
I
know
that
my
acknowledgement
of
this
aspect
has
changed
and
that
is
what
I
have
learned.
I
find
it
strange
that
someone
would
request
my
advice
to
new
WA's.
I
feel
like
I
have
learned
a
lot
over
the
past
year,
but
not
nearly
enough
to
be
asked
questions
or
be
looked
upon
for
help.
Although
everything
I
have
discussed
has
helped
me
grow
in
a
writing
sense
over
the
past
year,
there
are
also
a
couple
of
other
factors
that
I
have
discovered
through
the
WA
program.
I
have
learned
that
being
nice
often
gets
you
nowhere.
I
have
also
learned
that
no
matter
how
many
times
you
reschedule
with
someone,
if
they
do
not
show
up
the
first
time,
they
most
likely
aren't
going
to
show
up
the
second
time.
Or
the
third.
And
even
after
all
these
no-shows,
when
you
can
recite
the
Lafayette
Alumni
Newsletter
by
heart,
partly
because
it's
oftentimes
the
only
reading
material
in
Pardee
319,
you,
out
pure
sympathy
for
the
student's
really
busy
schedule
offer
to
read
the
paper
and
email
your
comments.
Unfortunately
I
am
guilty
of
trying
this
email
tactic.
And
from
each
time
I
learned
nothing
from
the
anger
I
felt
when
the
student
neglected
to
even
email
me
back
a
thank
you.
Just
coming
out
of
my
first
year
as
a
WA,
I
would
like
to
think
that
I
will
stop
these
habits
of
bending
over
backwards
for
these
students,
but
I
know
I
will
not.
And
I
know
this
because
the
last
week
in
the
semester,
while
sick,
I
stayed
up
to
almost
4
in
the
morning
helping
a
student
with
their
paper.
I
almost
could
justify
this
if
the
WA
program
paid
by
the
hour.
