Writing,
for
me,
is
the
ultimate
freedom.
It
provides
a
forum
to
put
forth
all
that
I
feel
and
think
with
impunity.
To
put
my
ideas
and
thoughts
onto
paper
is
to
separate
them
from
me,
giving
them
their
own
identity,
or
form,
from
the
abstractions
they
once
were.
Once
on
paper,
these
words
speak
for
me
from
a
distance.
In
the
end
they
may
be
praised
or
persecuted,
but
I
am
never
harmed.
Paradoxically,
we
become
independent
of
one
another
while
still
innately
tied.
Uttered
words
die
a
thousand
deaths,
but
my
voice
on
paper
lives
on.
It
is
for
this
reason,
this
legacy
that
writing
creates,
and
its
inability
to
be
destroyed,
censored,
or
constrained,
that
I
feel
it
is
the
ultimate
of
freedoms.
It
is
the
voice
that
echoes
throughout
time.
My
earliest
recollection
of
writing
comes
from
kindergarten.
At
this
early
level
writing
was
introduced
to
us
through
coloring.
I
can
still
remember
worksheets
with
block
letters
on
them
which
we
would
color
and
then,
as
a
class,
attempt
to
write
words
which
began
with
those
letters.
As
the
year
progressed,
our
assignments
became
more
detailed.
For
example,
I
can
recall
a
certain
assignment
in
which
we
were
told
to
draw
a
picture
of
our
family
and
then
attempt
to
describe
it.
Sentences
such
as
,
My
dad
is
tall
and
My
mom
is
pretty
were
all
too
common.
These
were
my
first
experiences
in
learning
to
express
myself
through
writing.
First
grade
marks
the
point
where
the
focus
shifted
from
coloring
to
writing.
Tedious
assignments
of
writing
and
rewriting
manuscript
letters
on
lined
sheets
of
paper
were
common.
Letter
games
were
played
and
stories
were
often
read
to
us
by
our
teachers.
I
believe
that
these
served
their
purpose,
which
was
to
make
students
excited
about
reading
and
writing
and
demonstrate
to
them
that
they
are
fun.
Other
assignments
were
standard,
usually
just
a
few
sentences
about
a
standardized
topic.
Creativity
did
not
have
a
role
in
this
early
stage
of
writing.
Second
and
third
grades
were
quite
similar.
Topics
for
assignments
usually
had
some
shared
interest
by
the
class,
such
as
holidays,
birthdays,
and
vacations.
Assignments
were
short,
usually
about
three
or
four
paragraphs,
as
we
were
still
learning
the
fundamentals
of
writing.
Some
creativity
was
displayed
in
composing
these
short
stories,
but
at
that
early
of
an
age
most
students
shared
common
interests
within
the
specified
topics.
The
only
real
individuality
that
was
displayed
was
in
our
choices
of
books
for
book
reports.
The
format
at
first
was
oversimplified
but
it
also
grew
increasingly
more
demanding.
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
reading
and
related
summaries
to
my
classmates,
especially
because
we
could
work
at
our
own
pace.
In
third
grade
alone
I
wrote
close
to
thirty
book
reports,
by
far
the
most
in
the
class.
Finally
allowing
us
some
room
to
grow,
my
fourth
grade
teacher
began
assigning
open
ended
topics
so
that
we
could
be
more
creative.
The
first
time
I.......
and
Late
one
night....
replaced
the
restricted
topics
of
the
past.
Most
were
assigned
with
a
certain
amount
of
words
necessary
to
receive
credit.
While
most
students
aimed
at
getting
as
close
to
the
target
number
as
possible,
my
best
friend
and
I
would
challenge
each
other
to
writing
the
longest
stories
in
the
class.
Filled
with
fourth-grade
level
intrigue
and
deceit,
we
would
write
mysteries
and
horror
stories,
all
the
while
exchanging
papers
and
helping
one
another.
As
I
now
look
back
at
this,
I
owe
much
of
my
writing
talent
to
these
interactions
with
my
best
friend.
Our
friendly
competition
aided
me
in
becoming
both
the
person
and
the
writer
that
I
am.
The
remainder
of
elementary
school
went
the
same
way.
Essay
assignments
were
open-ended
or
we
were
allowed
to
choose
our
own
topics.
The
lengths
of
said
assignments
grew
longer
progressively
until
they
reached
some
seven
hundred
and
fifty
to
one
thousand
words.
However,
the
genre
remained
the
same.
We
were
not
assigned
argumentative
or
research
topics
and
did
not
free
write
or
brainstorm
until
junior
high.
I
feel
that
I
grew
the
most
as
a
writer
in
junior
high.
For
two
years
I
had
the
same
advanced
English
teacher
and
he
was
extremely
supportive
of
my
work.
Most
teachers
had
always
praised
my
work,
as
I
just
had
some
ability
for
expressing
myself
effectively
on
paper.
But
this
teacher
was
different.
While
expressing
his
satisfaction
with
my
work,
he
found
ways
of
enlightening
me
about
how
to
excel
further.
His
commentaries
at
the
ends
of
my
papers
were
like
essays
themselves.
He
pushed
me,
and
for
that
I
am
eternally
grateful.
Our
assignments
varied.
Sometimes
it
was
a
report
on
a
book
while
others
it
was
a
How
to...
oral
report
in
front
of
the
class.
We
learned
how
to
begin
outlining
our
work
in
order
to
demonstrate
greater
adherence
to
our
topics
in
lengthier
works.
We
wrote
a
great
deal
in
class
frequently,
exactly
what
a
writer
needs
to
do
in
order
to
get
progressively
better.
My
interest
in
writing
was
increased
by
other
positive
feedback,
specifically
a
strong
showing
in
local
writing
competitions.
Essays
and
poems
that
I
wrote
were
entered
in
various
competitions
both
in
my
school
and
our
school
district
and
were
judged
to
be
of
high
quality.
Nothing
feels
more
satisfying
than
having
your
writing
accepted
favorably.
I
took
a
great
deal
of
pride
in
my
work
and
it
was
paying
off.
High
school
changed
my
writing
forever.
Again
I
was
blessed
with
a
brilliant
and
supportive
teacher
who
assisted
me
in
bringing
about
my
voice
in
my
writing.
For
two
years
I
worked
through
a
wide-array
of
genre.
At
the
beginning
of
each
English
class
we
free
wrote
for
five
to
ten
minutes
and
before
all
assignments
we
brainstormed.
Research
papers
were
introduced
and
became
a
substantial
part
of
my
writing.
Besides
writing
prose,
we
were
also
assigned
poetry
and
studied
masters
of
the
past.
Some
assignments
were
formed
on
an
argumentative
basis
while
others
centered
on
persuasion,
like
in
advertisements.
To
say
the
least
my
literary
arsenal
was
advancing
quickly.
It
seemed
as
though
every
day
some
new
point
was
highlighted
and
reinforced.
I
continued
submitting
my
work
to
local
competitions
and
I
continued
winning
them.
The
harder
I
worked
the
greater
the
reward
that
I
reaped.
The
introduction
of
these
genres
brought
with
them
a
new
and
greater
interest
in
writing.
It
seemed
as
though
there
was
little
that
my
writing
could
not
accomplish.
As
we
studied
Shakespeare
we
attempted
to
write
in
iambic
pentameter.
As
we
studied
Homer
we
attempted
to
create
an
epic
of
our
own
or
to
re-create
a
part
of
his.
After
reading
Chaucer
we
created
a
tale
of
our
own
pilgrim,
one
not
included
in
his
famous
pilgrimage.
The
past
was
given
a
new
life
through
our
assignments
and
in
the
same
way
my
writing
was
reborn.
These
same
positive
experiences
continued
through
eleventh
grade,
which
led
me
to
take
on
a
whole
new
endeavor.
As
everything
in
high
school
was
going
so
well,
I
enrolled
in
night
courses
at
a
local
university.
The
first
writing
course
that
I
entered
into
there
was
English
composition
102.
I
was
the
youngest
student
by
at
least
two
years,
but
I
was
well
prepared
for
what
was
to
come.
We
spent
most
of
our
in-class
time
dissecting
prose
and
poetry
and
writing
about
them.
One
paper
that
I
submitted
analyzed
the
similarities
between
Shakespeare's
Hamlet
and
Macbeth
,
while
others
drew
parallels
between
various
short
stories.
Still
other
papers
just
analyzed
individual
elements
of
single
pieces
of
literature,
such
as
symbolism
or
speculation
over
motive.
The
final
for
the
class,
a
research
paper,
was
assigned
at
the
beginning
of
the
semester.
Choosing
Shakespeare's
Hamlet,
I
wrote
A
Method
to
His
Madness:
Hamlet's
True
Sanity
by
analyzing
the
works
of
various
British
scholars.
Perhaps
it
was
the
environment,
surrounded
by
older
students,
that
caused
me
to
step
up
my
level
of
performance
but,
whatever
the
reason,
the
experience
was
incredible.
It
went
so
well
that
I
next
enrolled
in
an
intensive
writing
course
concerning
basic
social
questions
in
philosophy.
Now
the
youngest
student
by
some
ten
years,
I
was
accepted
warmly
into
a
community
of
adults
and
was
treated
as
one.
All
writing
assignments
were
argumentative,
dealing
with
concepts
introduced
by
philosophers
in
our
readings
or
by
our
professor
in
class.
Every
idea
that
I
had
and
every
rationale
that
I
used
had
to
be
carried
out
fully,
as
philosophical
reasoning
is
highly
complex
in
its
interwoven
cause
and
effect
relationships.
I
believe
that
I
began
by
arguing
against
a
feminist
stance
on
abortion.
Later
I
tackled
active
euthanasia
and
argued
that
it,
as
opposed
to
passive,
is
immoral.
Other
topics
included
murder,
drug
use,
affirmative
action,
and
pornography.
As
a
whole,
I
believe
this
class
to
have
been
the
most
valuable
that
I
have
ever
taken.
Every
opinion
is
totally
worthless
without
substantiation,
without
some
argument
behind
it,
and
this
class
focused
on
sharpening
the
skills
necessary
to
form
opinions.
I
feel
that
it
made
me
a
more
critical
writer,
one
who
analyzes
his
own
work
with
as
much
enthusiasm
as
a
reader
would.
In
some
odd
way
the
class
made
me
feel
whole,
as
if
I
would
be
removing
bias
and
prejudice
from
my
work
forever.
As
much
as
I
would
like
to
believe
that,
these
elements
can
appear
at
any
time,
so
it
is
important
to
be
vigilant
with
my
constructive
self-criticism.
My
senior
year
English
class
was
not
intensive
by
my
new
standards,
hence
I
was
quite
disappointed
in
it.
In
order
to
make
up
for
it
I
decided
to
take
another
night
class,
this
one
in
an
attempt
to
tie
up
all
of
the
loose
ends.
Having
a
strong
literary
background,
including
some
strong
written
skills
in
debate,
I
wondered
if
my
written
skills
now
exceeded
my
oral
ones.
Therefore
I
enrolled
in
a
public
speaking
course.
This,
I
hoped,
would
allow
me
to
compose,
pick
an
angle
of
debate,
research,
and
expose
lies
and
injustices
for
my
classmates
in
the
form
of
a
speech.
I
set
out
to
tackle
controversial
topics,
such
as
suppressed
information
on
AIDS
by
the
CDC,
or
center
for
disease
control,
as
well
as
White
House
dirty
dealings
involving
Indonesian
funding
of
the
reelection
campaign
as
well
as
Travelgate
and
the
death
of
Vincent
Foster.
All
of
the
writing
I
had
been
doing
for
the
previous
four
years
had
really
distracted
me
from
how
difficult
it
is
to
be
concise
in
a
prescribed
time
period.
My
papers
end
when
I
have
said
all
that
I
have
to
say,
but
that
all
changes
when
the
professor
is
holding
a
stopwatch.
It
brings
about
a
journalistic
side
to
an
assignment,
as
reporters
are
often
limited
to
a
certain
amount
of
lines.
It
was,
by
far,
the
most
difficult
course
I
had
taken
in
some
time,
but
from
it
I
learned
a
long
forgotten
art
form,
brevity.
I
suppose
the
next
writing
experience
that
is
worth
writing
about
concerns
college
entrance
essays.
All
of
my
years
of
experience
culminated
with
this
assignment.
Topics
varied
from
how
I
spent
my
previous
summer,
to
people
of
influence
in
my
life,
books,
movies,
and
the
future.
I
chose
to
apply
to
eight
schools
and
because
of
this
I
had
my
writing
cut
out
for
me.
As
I
wrote
earlier,
I
believe
that
writing
creates
an
identity
independent
of
you.
My
writing
had
always
been
accepted,
but
would
these
two
independents
converge,
would
/
be
accepted
for
it?
The
simple
answer
is
not
necessarily.
The
writing
that
I
had
been
so
proud
of
did
not
gain
me
acceptance
everywhere
I
applied,
but
it
did
enough.
Needless
to
say,
my
pre-Lafayette
writing
experiences
were
more
than
ample
in
preparing
me
for
four
years
here.
My
first
year
seminar
was
quite
interesting,
but
it
was
not
an
intensive
writing
course.
Assignments
were
challenging,
but
more
so
for
students
who
never
experienced
college
work
before.
Having
already
fulfilled
my
first
year
writing
requirement,
I
was
free
to
take
a
Russian
history
course
with
a
most
interesting
professor.
All
assignments
were
written
and
quite
enjoyable.
Whether
it
be
sifting
through
communist
propaganda,
analyzing
post-soviet
Russia,
or
using
writing
skills
to
discuss/critique
classic
films
pertinent
to
the
field
of
study,
my
literary
background
had
me
quite
ready
for
the
challenge.
I
greatly
look
forward
to
taking
a
comparative
literature
course
in
the
future
and
am
focused
on
becoming
a
well
respected
writing
assistant.
