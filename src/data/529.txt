Writing
Narrative
2005-2006
Regardless
of
the
type
of
writing
I
am
undertaking,
I
find
myself
clinging
to
certain
habits
as
essential
steps
within
my
writing
process.
Any
piece
of
writing
that
is
important
to
me
always
begins
with
my
current
pen
of
choice
and
a
notepad.
Sometimes
I
have
formulated
an
outline
in
my
mind
to
put
down
on
the
paper,
but
at
other
times,
the
frictionless
motion
of
physically
writing
allows
me
to
begin
the
initial
brainstorming
of
ideas.
Over
the
last
year,
this
routine
has
seen
me
through
many
nontraditional
writing
attempts.
As
a
junior
premedical
biology
major,
I
was
in
the
thick
of
science
courses
with
decreasing
quantities
of
writing.
There
was
little
time
to
long
for
my
beloved
literature
courses
because
I
faced
difficult
coursework
and
fresh
writing
issues.
The
engulfing
nature
of
college
courses
and
demanding
professors
causes
students
to
focus
too
narrowly
on
limited
types
of
writing.
After
completing
my
sophomore
year,
I
had
learned
a
great
deal
about
my
ability
to
write
in
response
to
literature,
and
my
writing
style
evolved
around
literary
criticism
papers.
Therefore,
it
was
fortunate
that
as
a
junior,
I
took
a
freshman
level
course,
which
forced
me
to
return
to
non-literature
based
writing.
In
Sociology
101,
the
assignments
were
typical
and
usually
asked
us
to
consider
ideas
discussed
in
class
and
write
a
paper
about
them
utilizing
the
class
reading
and
video
screenings.
For
the
first
draft
I
wrote
for
this
class,
I
made
the
classic
mistake
of
writing
an
essay
outlining
the
points
we
had
made
in
class.
Upon
rereading
my
paper,
it
did
not
meet
my
personal
expectations;
it
was
dull
and
unoriginal.
This
experience
in
my
junior
year
reinforced
the
fundamental
idea
that
successful
writing
requires
unique
ideas
that
are
separate
from
those
discussed
in
class
or
read
in
books.
Another
component
of
writing
that
I
believed
to
have
mastered
in
high
school
was
appropriate
grammar.
In
Molecular
Biology,
I
wrote
a
manuscript
for
a
semester
long
project,
and
the
scientific
writing
assignment
challenged
me
to
reevaluate
my
understanding
of
syntax.
As
a
Lafayette
freshman,
I
struggled
to
overcome
my
poor
habit
of
using
passive
voice
in
my
writing.
The
professor
assigning
the
manuscript
not
only
allowed
passive
voice,
but
also
encouraged
it.
This
contradiction
in
the
rules
for
proper
writing
is
frustrating
when
I
switch
between
disciplines.
Another
grammar
issue
that
I
had
previously
not
considered
was
how
to
make
certain
science
related
words
plural.
For
instance,
a
common
mistake
is
that
the
word,
bacteria,
is
actually
the
plural
form
of
bacterium.
Although
this
is
a
minor
error
when
speaking,
the
professor
reading
my
paper
finds
a
small
mistake
like
that
careless
and
therefore
harmful
to
oneOs
grade.
Another
manuscript
criterion
of
the
professorOs
was
the
need
for
my
writing
to
be
as
concise
as
possible.
This
certainly
applies
well
to
scientific
and
technical
writing,
and
I
tried
my
best
to
comply.
When
considering
this
concise
style,
I
began
to
consider
how
it
overlaps
with
other
writing
disciplines.
Perhaps
it
is
not
so
detrimental
to
attempt
more
concise
writing
even
when
the
genre
of
writing
is
less
restrictive.
Since
considering
this
idea,
I
have
experimented
with
cutting
down
the
excess
words
and
phrases
in
my
papers
for
a
more
direct
approach.
It
is
a
challenge
to
dissect
my
writing
into
the
necessary
components
and
the
excessive
verbiage,
and
I
do
not
feel
it
is
a
style
that
I
have
mastered.
In
the
spring
of
2006,
my
course
load
consisted
solely
of
science
courses
with
little
to
no
writing.
However,
I
did
encounter
a
new
writing
situation
in
my
preparation
for
the
Medical
College
Admissions
Test.
One
portion
of
the
test
is
a
writing
portion,
which
consists
of
two
timed
essay.
The
test
provides
a
prompt
and
then
the
test
taker
has
thirty
minutes
to
compose
an
organized
essay
fulfilling
the
three
components
of
the
prompt.
For
three
months,
I
practiced
this
type
of
writing,
and
by
test
day,
the
essays
I
wrote
were
formula
writing
at
its
finest.
I
knew
exactly
how
many
paragraphs
I
would
write
and
what
angle
each
of
them
would
take.
The
only
variety
was
the
examples
I
selected
in
order
to
correspond
with
the
correct
prompt.
As
a
writer,
I
felt
extremely
lazy
and
phony.
The
other
new
issue
resulting
from
the
MCAT
writing
section
was
timed
writing.
It
was
challenging
to
come
up
with
a
creative
response
and
example
within
a
limited
time.
I
usually
found
that
if
I
came
up
with
a
good
idea
to
write
about,
I
would
run
out
of
time
to
proofread
my
writing.
For
this
reason,
the
quality
of
the
essay
often
suffered
out
of
necessity
for
a
complete
essay
with
few
technical
errors.
Having
a
limited
time
to
craft
an
essay
was
frustrating
because
it
does
not
reflect
the
environment
in
which
I
normally
complete
my
writing.
Rarely
would
I
ever
sit
down
and
write
something
important
in
the
small
time
span
of
thirty
minutes
without
later
returning
to
the
piece
for
revision
and
editing.
One
aspect
of
the
MCAT
writing
section
that
I
truly
enjoyed
was
the
fact
that
it
was
my
only
opportunity
to
write
during
a
semester
lacking
any
other
creative
outlet.
Although
the
writing
sample
section
was
important,
I
knew
that
the
graders
were
more
concerned
with
your
ability
to
write
an
organized
sentence
than
the
content
of
the
essay.
For
this
reason,
I
felt
a
bit
of
guilty
freedom
when
choosing
examples
to
fulfill
the
writing
prompts.
During
the
practice
sessions,
I
often
enjoyed
playing
devilOs
advocate
in
my
essays
by
supporting
my
arguments
with
radical
ideas.
Unsurprisingly,
the
fun
ended
on
the
actual
test
day.
The
writing
section
no
longer
seemed
like
entertainment,
but
rather
a
stressful
thirty-minute
period
during
which
I
used
the
most
concrete
examples
I
could
fathom.
The
follow
up
to
my
MCAT
writing
was
my
personal
statement
for
my
medical
school
applications.
The
personal
statement
portion
of
the
application
does
not
actually
have
a
specific
prompt
to
follow,
but
rather
it
is
common
knowledge
that
applicants
should
somehow
write
something
that
reveals
why
exactly
they
want
to
be
a
doctor.
As
an
aspiring
physician,
this
essay
felt
like
the
most
important
and
difficult
writing
assignment
of
my
life.
When
writing
my
personal
statement,
I
felt
the
pressure
to
be
unique
and
interesting
to
a
vague
audience.
The
audience,
as
far
as
I
knew,
would
be
a
veteran
physician
who
had
read
hundreds
of
essays
on
NWhy
I
want
to
be
a
doctorO
before.
As
I
struggled
through
drafts,
I
was
frustrated
that
there
was
no
professor
that
had
assigned
me
to
write
the
personal
statement.
Unlike
my
college
writing,
I
could
not
seek
out
someone
to
clarify
if
I
was
in
fact
addressing
the
assignment
properly.
The
personal
statement
is
not
a
piece
of
writing
that
will
be
graded
by
one
person,
but
rather
it
will
be
critiqued
by
a
multitude
of
people
with
different
writing
preferences.
Perhaps
this
type
of
writing
is
a
glimpse
of
the
types
of
writing
I
will
face
beyond
my
college
level
courses.
The
vicious
cycle
continued,
and
I
began
to
receive
secondary
applications
to
the
medical
schools,
each
with
one
to
two
new
essays.
Because
I
applied
to
twenty-one
schools,
this
meant
I
needed
to
write
about
thirty
essays
as
fast
as
I
could
in
order
to
stay
on
top
of
the
rolling
admissions
process.
I
found
myself
continuously
trying
to
find
ways
to
make
the
essays
overlap
so
that
I
would
not
have
to
write
an
entire
new
one
for
each
school.
However,
I
could
not
ignore
the
need
for
these
essays
to
be
impressive
to
admissions
committees.
Writing
about
positive
qualities
I
possess
was
not
only
difficult,
but
also
annoying.
Somewhere
around
essay
number
fifteen,
I
began
to
see
my
extracurricular
activities
as
repetitive
examples
rather
than
proof
that
I
am
qualified
for
medical
school.
The
most
frustrating
aspect
of
this
type
of
writing
was
the
fear
that
as
one
of
thousands
of
applicants,
my
essays
would
not
even
be
read.
Despite
my
constant
focus
on
the
sciences
and
getting
into
medical
school,
I
had
constant
exposure
to
writing
through
my
duties
as
a
Writing
Associate.
As
a
veteran
WA,
I
gained
confidence
in
myself
and
my
abilities
to
assist
my
peers
with
their
writing.
In
the
previous
year,
I
had
felt
that
handing
a
writer
a
writing
utensil
at
the
beginning
of
a
conference
was
presumptuous
and
imposing.
Now
I
felt
confident
enough
to
hand
the
writer
a
pen
and
explained
that
if
they
thought
of
something
they
wanted
to
change
or
add
in
their
paper
that
they
should
feel
free
to
write
it
down.
In
my
second
year
as
a
WA,
I
also
learned
to
persist
with
questions
even
if
the
writer
seemed
quiet
or
hesitant
to
talk.
By
being
more
aggressive
than
passive
during
conferences,
students
were
further
engaged
into
a
productive
conversation.
The
two
professors
I
worked
with
during
my
junior
year
taught
me
a
lot
about
the
process
of
creating
writing
assignments.
One
professor
was
a
veteran
WA
professor
and
significant
participant
in
the
College
Writing
Program.
When
I
worked
with
the
veteran
professor,
I
discovered
that
she
was
genuinely
interested
in
my
input
and
conference
feedback.
Because
of
this
show
of
respect,
I
took
my
role
in
the
course
more
seriously,
and
I
spent
more
time
thinking
about
how
different
writing
assignments
could
benefit
the
students
within
the
class.
In
particular,
I
saw
that
because
the
students
had
the
option
of
picking
one
of
a
few
assignments,
some
were
prone
combining
the
assignments
rather
than
addressing
one
clearly.
I
discussed
with
the
professor
the
idea
of
ensuring
that
the
students
pick
one
clear
assignment
before
beginning
to
write.
With
this
veteran
professor,
we
decided
to
utilize
the
group
conference
technique
in
order
to
increase
the
amount
of
peer
review
and
communication.
However,
I
found
that
the
groups
often
lacked
a
certain
balance.
More
outgoing
members
of
the
class
typically
dominated,
while
quieter
members
spoke
little
throughout
the
entire
conference.
From
this,
I
learned
that
in
group
conferences
like
this,
I
need
to
work
to
facilitate
a
more
balanced
communication
between
the
varying
members.
Even
though
it
is
a
group
conference,
my
role
of
directing
the
focus
is
just
as
important
as
in
a
one-on-one
conference.
Working
with
a
professor
teaching
a
V.A.S.T.
for
the
first
time,
I
saw
first
hand
the
struggles
involved
in
teaching
writing.
I
benefited
from
the
professor
in
that
he
consistently
requested
my
advice
on
how
to
prepare
assignments
that
would
draw
in
the
types
of
papers
he
wanted
from
the
students.
When
the
professor
received
the
papers
for
his
second
assignment,
the
fact
that
the
papers
were
nothing
like
what
he
had
expected
completely
stunned
him.
It
was
difficult
for
him
to
generate
assignments
that
were
open
enough
to
allow
unique
ideas
without
the
students
moving
too
far
away
from
the
general
writing
focus,
and
he
therefore
ended
up
making
the
next
assignment
too
specific.
The
papers
for
the
next
assignment
were
almost
all
exactly
the
same
without
much
thought
put
into
writing
them.
This
caused
me
to
reflect
back
to
my
sociology
class
when
I
had
struggled
with
writing
about
my
own
ideas
rather
than
someone
elseOs,
and
I
tried
to
use
my
own
experience
to
assist
the
students
in
this
situation.
Working
with
these
two
professors
had
the
combined
affect
on
me
to
be
more
forward
when
dealing
with
my
own
professors.
By
working
so
closely
with
the
WA
professors,
I
learned
that
most
professors
want
their
students
to
approach
them
about
their
writing
assignments.
Going
to
see
a
professor
can
help
clarify
issues
with
the
assignment
for
both
the
student
and
the
professor.
Writing
assignments
should
not
be
a
guessing
game,
but
rather
an
open
conversation
about
writing
technique
and
content.
Although
I
stand
by
my
conclusions
from
previous
years
that
writing
is
not
about
determining
what
the
professor
wants
to
read,
I
now
see
that
professors
can
be
a
resource
for
technical
issues
and
discussion
of
ideas.
As
my
junior
year
progressed,
I
felt
that
I
was
not
doing
much
writing
and
that
my
growth
as
a
writer
was
temporarily
paused.
Upon
reflection,
I
realized
that
in
fact
I
accomplished
many
feats
throughout
the
year
as
I
completed
assignments
that
were
out
of
my
comfort
zone.
The
writing
I
completed
showed
me
that
a
pressure
to
impress
a
specific
audience
exists
even
when
the
audience
is
a
range
of
people.
I
almost
consider
myself
lucky
when
writing
in
college
because
I
typically
only
need
to
reach
one
person
as
my
audience.
Although
I
am
pleased
with
my
progress
in
my
junior
year,
I
look
forward
to
more
creative
writing
assignments
in
my
final
year
at
Lafayette.
