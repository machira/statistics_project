WA
paper
The
history
of
my
recent
writing
development
is
largely
a
record
of
inaction.
This
is
especially
true
spring
semester,
which
I
spent
studying
in
the
Netherlands
and
only
wrote
a
single
five-page
paper.
Despite
my
lack
of
writing
time
recently,
circumstances
permitted
me
to
make
realizations
regarding
the
importance
of
writing
towards
an
audience.
Since
these
developments
began
in
the
fall,
during
a
semester
in
which
I
was
still
an
active
writer,
that
is
the
best
place
to
begin
this
narrative.
When
I
returned
to
campus
last
fall,
I
had
a
years
Waing
experience
under
my
belt
and
was
excited
to
be
assigned
to
a
position
which
I
was
extremely
comfortable
with.
I
was
reassigned
to
the
same
professor
and
same
FYS
I
had
waed
for
the
previous
fall.
The
professor
and
I
had
a
good
relationship
and
I
understood
the
type
of
work
he
anticipated
out
of
his
students.
This
allowed
for
a
smooth
semester
with
only
one
traumatic
incident.
One
of
the
students
in
the
class
tended
to
approach
the
assignments
differently
than
the
rest
of
the
students.
She
was
obviously
a
talented
and
creative
writer
and
her
excitement
made
conferences
enjoyable.
From
her
grades
on
the
first
two
papers
it
seemed
as
though
the
professor
appreciated
her
non-convential
approach,
as
well.
On
the
third
and
final
assignment,
her
draft
was
very
original
and
innovative,
even
more
so
than
the
other
first
drafts
had
been.
Despite
this
level
of
creativity
I
felt
she
was
able
to
meet
the
professors
expectations,
so
I
encouraged
her
to
maintain
her
creativity
in
the
final
draft.
In
all
honesty,
I
felt
it
was
the
best
paper
out
of
the
batch
and
assumed
that
the
professor
would
have
the
same
opinion.
Unfortunately
for
this
student,
I
misread
the
professor's
tastes.
I
received
a
telephone
call
from
him
asking
for
details
about
the
student's
first
draft
and
our
conference.
He
explained
to
me
that
he
felt
that
she
had
missed
the
goals
of
the
paper
and
was
forced
to
give
her
an
extremely
low
mark.
However,
since
her
work
had
always
been
of
high
quality,
he
was
allowing
her
a
rewrite.
I
was
told
that
I
might
receive
a
phone
call
from
her
setting
up
another
conference.
That
this
call
never
occurred
did
not
surprise
me,
since
she
no
doubt
blamed
me
for
encouraging
her
to
write
a
paper
that
her
professor
disliked.
In
many
ways
I
felt
as
if
I
had
let
her
and
the
professor
down.
To
the
student
it
must
have
seemed
as
if
I
had
not
listened
to
the
professor's
expectations
of
the
assignment,
and
I
began
to
ask
this
question
to
myself.
It
appeared
to
me
that
I
had
not
understood
the
professor's
goals
and
I
even
felt
that
I
had
overstepped
my
boundaries
as
a
WA
by
abandoning
the
professors
issues
in
favor
of
a
paper
that
was
fun
to
read.
I
am
still
unsure
if
this
is
true
or
not,
and
do
not
know
how
to
draw
the
line
between
encouraging
creativity
and
tailoring
papers
to
get
the
highest
possible
grade.
To
me,
WA's
appear
to
heave
to
deal
with
a
large
gray
area
where
creative
papers
that
appear
to
follow
the
assignment's
guidelines
fall,
since
our
stated
goal
is
to
help
students
develop
their
writing
skills.
The
most
important
lesson
that
I
took
away
is
that
there
is
no
way
to
truly
understand
the
tastes
of
the
audience,
one
needs
to
maker
the
best
educated
guess
possible
and
hope
for
the
best.
Those
were
the
Wa
ing
questions
I
was
grappling
with
at
the
end
of
the
fall
semester.
In
a
way,
they
seem
to
be
the
Holy
Grail
of
WA
questions
because
they
strike
at
the
core
of
the
position.
Unfortunately,
there
was
no
way
to
bring
closure
since
I
was
going
abroad
and
therefor
not
WAing
for
a
semester.
As
a
result,
they
are
the
issues
that
continue
to
disturb
me
as
I
begin
this
new
year.
However,
I
do
believe
that
I
will
be
more
cautious
in
encouraging
too
creative
of
an
approach
towards
assignments
this
year.
But
even
having
said
that,
I
can
not
honestly
say
that
I
would
not
encourage
that
student
to
remain
creative
on
another
assignment
if
I
were
to
have
another
conference
with
her.
It
just
seems
that
to
do
so
would
do
a
great
disservice
to
her
writing.
Last
semester
the
issue
of
audience
came
up
in
a
very
different
context.
I
guess
that
I
may
have
overstated
the
inaction
of
my
writing
last
semester
earlier,
because
although
I
was
not
employed
as
a
WA
in
the
Netherlands,
I
became
a
nonofficial
writing
associate
for
other
students
living
in
my
building.
The
University
of
Maastricht
is
international
and
about
half
the
student
body
is
from
outside
the
Netherlands.
In
order
to
do
make
this
work,
the
courses
are
taught
in
either
English
or
Dutch.
Because
of
this,
a
large
percentage
of
students
take
courses
in
a
language
that
is
not
their
native
tongue.
Professors
are
also
forced
to
teach
in
a
language
that
they
do
not
speak
naturally.
This
formula
creates
the
potential
for
miscommunication,
which
is
very
often
realized.
In
this
environment,
English
speakers
are
a
precious
commodity
in
the
classroom
and
often
were
asked
to
play
the
role
of
a
pronunciation
guide.
This
had
the
unfortunate
result
of
weakening
my
own
grammatical
skills,
however,
since
I
was
constantly
exposed
to
mispronounced
and
non-existent
words.
After
a
few
months,
I
began
to
use
phrases
that
would
give
my
third
grade
teacher
fits
because
I
had
been
so
immersed
in
poor
English.
This
corruption
of
the
English
language
did
not
stop
at
the
oral
language,
and
neither
did
the
responsibility
of
the
English
speakers
to
help
assist
communication.
I
found
myself
becoming
a
writing
aid
to
students
in
my
building.
It
was
bizarre
at
first,
because
I
have
become
used
to
my
role
as
a
WA
of
trying
to
focus
on
the
higher
order
concerns
of
structure
and
clarity
and
there
I
was
asked
to
deal
intensively
with
the
lower
order
concern
of
grammar.
In
fact,
since
a
number
of
the
students
were
doctoral
candidates
in
either
law
or
economics
and
wrote
extremely
technical
papers,
I
could
not
understand
the
concepts
of
the
paper.
I
also
do
not
know
what
the
established
style
of
the
particular
field's
demands,
so
I
could
not
help
too
much
with
organization.
Actually,
some
parts
of
the
experience
were
similar,
like
when
desperate
students
came
running
up
to
me
so
I
could
help
them
with
their
paper,
hours
before
it
was
due,
bringing
back
flashbacks
to
phonecalls
I
have
received
from
some
procrastinating
first
year
students.
The
experience
also
resulted
in
some
interesting
intercultural
incidents.
For
example,
I
helped
one
of
my
Italian
friends
on
a
few
of
his
law
papers.
The
combination
of
legalistic
terms
and
his
lack
of
grammatical
mastery,
I
could
only
understand
about
half
of
his
sentences.
Many
of
his
paragraphs
were
extremely
drawn
out
and
could
be
summed
up
clearly
in
a
phrase
or
two.
After
cutting
about
a
page
off
of
his
paper,
he
turned
to
me
and
said
I'm
Italian,
I
like
words.
All
Italians
like
words.
For
us,
its
better
to
use
fifty
words
than
5
concise
ones.
I
am
not
sure
if
his
affinity
for
wordiness
represents
his
entire
culture,
but
it
did
make
me
realize
just
how
hard
it
must
be
for
these
foreign
students.
They
not
only
need
to
master
another
languages
vocabulary
and
grammar,
but
also
they
need
to
conform
to
the
cultures
written
expectations.
I
was
never
able
to
discover
what
the
Netherlands
written
expectations
consisted
of
because
I
was
only
assigned
one
five
page
paper,
but
my
experience
taught
me
how
important
the
audience
is
when
composing
a
paper.
Really,
the
importance
of
making
the
audience
happy
has
haunted
me
in
the
past
year.
And
as
I
return
this
fall,
WA
a
new
class
and
ambitiously
starting
a
thesis,
it
does
not
appear
as
if
the
problems
of
pleasing
the
audience
will
go
away
any
time
soon.
