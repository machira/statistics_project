Summer
Writing
Assignment
August
9,
2002
WA
Program
I
must
confess
that
only
recently
have
I
become
a
fan
of
the
writing
process,
in
all
of
its
complexity
and
demands.
I
remember
being,
from
a
very
early
age,
almost
actively
opposed
to
the
whole
idea
of
the
written
assignment.
I
thrived
on
the
standard
examinations
that
characterized
much
of
my
elementary
school
years.
In
recollection,
I
believe
this
was
so
because
of
the
inherent
nature
of
the
examination.
Examinations,
as
well
as
the
preparation
leading
up
to
them,
were
much
more
deliberate,
much
more
objective.
There
was
no
real
gray
area:
If
one
studied
what
she
was
supposed
until
she
knew
it
down
pat,
chances
were
that
the
grade
would
reflect
as
such.
One
either
circled
the
correct
answer
or
one
did
not.
Written
assignments
were
much
more
ambiguous:
There
really
is
no
perfect
way
to
evaluate
an
essay.
Subjectivity
is
the
norm.
I
didn't
like
that,
and
still
to
some
extent
still
do
not.
After
all,
your
tangible
reward
(which
is
by
no
means
the
end
all,
be
all
of
the
academic
experience)
boils
down
to
an
opinion,
for
better
or
worse.
To
say
it
plainly,
I
preferred
the
objective
assignment
to
the
subjective
because
it
was
much
more
conducive
to
feeding
my
competitive
impulses:
I
could
prove
I
was
better
than
someone
else
with
a
test
score
whereas
a
grade
on
a
writing
assignment
only
reflected
an
opinion
and
was
therefore
fallible.
I
truly
believe
that
I
only
really
started
to
enjoy
writing
when
I
began
to
care
less
and
less
about
the
subsequent
grade
I
would
receive.
This
isn't
to
say
I
lack
the
drive
I
once
had
but
merely
reflects
the
fact
that
I
don't
care
nearly
as
much
about
proving
myself
to
anyone
else.
I
will
always
remember
my
first
piece
of
writing
because
I
still
keep
it
with
me.
It
was
a
very
brief
rehashing
of
my
first
trip
to
the
Danbury
Mall
in
Connecticut;
It
still
amazes
me
how
far
I
have
come
in
the
last
10+
years
in
my
life.
The
little
booklet
was
really
no
more
than
8
pages
long
with
no
more
than
10
words
on
each
page
while
the
text
is
badly
outdone
by
my
poor
attempts
at
visual
representation.
I
could
never
draw
very
well
and
the
piece
makes
that
quite
clear.
And
yet
the
fact
that
each
picture
takes
up
almost
all
of
each
page
is
further
proof
of
what
used
to
be
my
general
distaste
for
writing.
My
writing
style
was
very
direct,
deliberate
and
boring;
filled
with
sentences
typical
of
young
children-
you
know,
of
the,
"and
then......",
variety.
I
think
this
"style"
was
typical
of
my
writing,
with
the
usual
increased
use
of
diction
and
detail
of
course,
until
nearly
junior
high
school.
The
lone
exception
that
comes
to
my
mind
was
any
instance
that
came
to
pass
which
involved
writing
about
sports.
Soccer
and
basketball
was
what
I
did,
loved
and
talked
throughout
much
of
my
youth.
Even
my
dislike
of
writing
couldn't
dissuade
me
from
expressing
myself
textually
when
it
came
to
sports.
I
still
remember
the
football
"book"
(if
you
can
call
it
that)
that
I
made
during
the
first
grade.
It
contained,
surprise,
a
series
of
pictures
and
very
little
text.
But
they
were
less
pictures
than
diagrams
of
football
plays.
I
would
draw
pages
and
pages
of
plays
and
formations
and
even
try
to
describe
them.
My
teacher
probably
would
have
sworn
that
I
was
destined
to
be
a
football
coach
by
the
look
of
the
things.
A
nascent
John
Madden
for
sure.
I
even
wrote
an
extensive
essay
about
my
first
competitive
soccer
game,
complete
with
a
conclusion
and
everything
in
which
I
tried
to
explain
that
I
understood
that
winning
and
losing,
while
important
at
the
time
for
sure,
was,
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things,
minor.
I
have
difficulty
remembering
any
specific
pieces
of
creative
writing
that
I
produced
even
through
middle
school.
Come
to
think
of
it,
this
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
creative
writing
was
never
really
stressed
to
me
during
that
time
period.
I
recall
doing
a
lot
of
short-story
reading
and
vocabulary
exercises
but
very
little
actual
writing.
I
always
did
well
with
history
or
science
assignments
because
of
the
empirical
element
that
they
maintain.
I
recall
making
it
a
point
of
mine
to
be
very
detailed
and
thorough
in
my
assignments,
sort
of
adopting
the
mentality
that
creativity
and
innovation
were
less
important
to
the
teacher
than
was
the
mass
accumulation
of
facts,
figures
and
sources.
I
am
sure
that
I
didn't
comprehend
the
idea
that
writing
was
more
than
just
a
different
medium
for
the
regurgitation
of
learned
material.
To
me,
all
writing
used
to
represent
was
a
more
tedious
and
difficult
version
of
a
short
answer
question
on
an
exam.
I
do
consider
myself
to
be
a
good
writer
at
this
point
in
my
life.
Just
how
I
became
one
I
cannot
say.
All
I
can
say
is
that
I
think
the
transformation
occurred
sometime
during
high
school.
There
are
no
specific
instances
that
I
can
point
to
as
seminal
in
my
writing
career.
I
think
like
most
personal
changes
that
one
undergoes
throughout
their
high
school
years,
my
transformation
as
a
writer
was
uneventful
and
undetected
but
very
real
when
viewed
with
some
circumspection.
I
arrived
at
Lafayette
with
the
capacity
to
write
capably
without
ever
knowing
where
that
capacity
came
from.
I
can
definitely
say
that
writing
was
much
more
of
a
way
of
life
in
high
school
then
it
was
in
junior
high.
I
was
expected
to
write
essay
after
essay
in
almost
all
of
my
classes.
Practice
and
repetition
no
doubt
were
responsible
for
a
measure
of
my
transformation.
I
guess
I
had
no
choice
but
to
become
a
good
writer,
given
the
preponderance
of
written
assignments
I
was
given.
I
am
almost
positive
that
two
English
teachers
from
early
on
in
high
school
were
most
responsible.
I
actually
liked
English
classes
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
and
enjoyed
coming
to
class.
The
courses
were
like
nothing
I
had
ever
experienced
before.
The
students
did
much
more
talking
than
the
teacher
did.
My
peers
and
I
handed
out
almost
as
many
answers
as
my
teachers
had
questions.
And
I
was
right
in
the
middle
of
it
all.
I
paid
more
attention
to
my
subsequent
writing
assignments
because
I
enjoyed
the
thought
of
the
praise
it
might
receive
or
the
discussion
it
might
evoke.
I
have
always
liked
to
argue
and
scrutinize
and
writing
offered
a
perfect
opportunity
to
do
so.
I
believe
this
is
when
I
began
to
see
writing
as
an
opportunity
rather
than
a
requirement.
My
writing
began
to
incorporate
logic
and
hypotheses
and
arguments
and
started
to
diverge
from
mere
enumeration.
Structure
played
an
increasingly
important
role.
I
had
always
been
an
organized
writer
but
became
even
more
so.
I
vividly
remember
asking
many
more
questions
in
my
essays.
Instead
of
trying
to
keep
essays
vanilla
and
to
the
point,
I
would
open
them
up
to
new
complexities;
offering
a
variety
of
opinions
and
presenting
numerous
possibilities.
A
senior
Constitutional
Law
class
offered
a
perfect
example
of
how
far
I
had
come.
I
thrived
in
the
class
because
of
my
ability
to
write
and
because
of
the
nature
of
the
assignments.
Instead
of
essays
I
was
writing
argument
briefs
and
legal
notes.
I
found
that
creating
syllogisms
and
forming
conclusions
based
on
logical
arguments
came
very
easily
for
me.
I
could
process
a
lot
of
information
and
make
a
causal,
logical
argument
without
too
much
trouble.
There
was
a
specific
writing
assignment
that
sticks
out
in
my
mind.
After
listening
to
a
debate
held
in
class,
the
teacher
informed
those
of
us
that
did
not
participate
that
we
all
had
to
decide
upon
a
winner
and
produce
a
single,
written
decision-
much
like
the
Supreme
Court
renders
a
decision
through
a
written
majority
opinion
signed
by
its
supporters.
After
much
deliberation,
we
decided
to
make
outlines
of
our
individual
arguments
and
reconvene
to
consolidate
our
works
into
a
final
piece.
Instead
of
doing
so,
I
went
home
and
wrote
out
a
complete
majority
opinion
of
my
own.
The
other
students
in
my
group
read
it
over
and
agreed
to
accept
it
as
the
final
piece.
They
all
signed
it
the
next
morning
and
we
received
an
A
on
the
project.
I
can't
ever
remember
enjoying
a
writing
assignment
as
much
as
that
one.
I
must
have
sat
up
in
my
room
for
3
or
4
hours
straight
one
night
and
produced
3
different
drafts.
I
had
never
really
done
that
before,
despite
my
teachers'
pleas
to
the
contrary.
To
this
day
I
still
write
out
my
papers
by
hand
before
I
do
anything
else
because
of
how
well
it
worked
for
me
during
that
assignment.
It
was
also
during
my
high
school
years
that
I
began
writing
seriously
outside
of
the
classroom.
I
was
a
frequent
contributor
to
the
school
newspaper
in
both
the
news
and
sports
section
and
was
even
named
sports
editor
for
my
senior
year.
I
wrote
a
lengthy
article
about
our
basketball
team
during
the
winter
of
my
senior
year
that
may
have
been
one
of
my
better
pieces
of
writing.
I
couldn't
play
with
the
team
that
year
because
I
had
badly
broken
my
leg
earlier
in
the
fall
during
the
soccer
season
so
I
decided
to
help
the
new
coach
out
as
an
assistant
during
the
year
and
kept
the
school
up
to
date
through
the
paper.
I
was
crutching
along
through
campus
one
day
when
an
English
teacher
I
had
had
the
previous
year
stopped
me
and
said
that
she
loved
my
article
and
was
very
impressed.
She
asked
if
I
would
be
writing
anything
else
soon
and
if
I
would
continue
on
during
my
college
years.
I
hadn't
given
it
much
thought
but
was
flattered
by
the
compliment.
I
think
more
than
anything,
my
growth
as
a
critical
reader
was
the
catalyst
for
my
growth
as
a
writer.
I
have
thought
about
the
concept
before-
how
do
people
become
good
writers?
I
can't
think
of
anything
better
than
reading.
I
know
my
writing
style
is
an
eclectic
blend
of
all
of
the
authors'
works
that
I
have
read
throughout
my
lifetime.
I
incorporate
all
sorts
of
ideas
from
different
authors
into
my
own
writings,
be
it
diction,
tone,
structure,
ect.
I
catch
myself
now
and
then
while
I
am
writing
trying
to
remember
where
I
got
the
idea
I
had
just
put
down
on
paper
because
I
sense
somehow
that
I
have
heard
it
before.
In
that
sense,
I
really
must
credit
my
success
as
a
writer
to
all
of
the
authors
that
have
influenced
me
throughout
my
life.
When
I
write
an
essay,
the
ideas
are
be
mine
but
the
way
I
express
and
convey
them
is
due
in
large
part
to
my
experiences
as
a
reader.
1
do
believe
that
I
was
prepared
to
write
effectively
at
the
college
level
when
I
first
arrived
Lafayette.
I
have
never
felt
incapable
or
inadequate
in
that
respect
but
have
experienced
situations
where
I
have
felt
overwhelmed
by
the
amount
of
work
assigned.
I
fully
expected
college
to
throw
these
types
of
situations
at
me
and
believe
I
am
a
better
writer
for
it.
I
do
think
that
I
need
to
focus
on
my
preparation
as
I
head
into
my
3rd
year.
I
have
been
stuck
pulling
the
proverbial
all-nighter
on
more
than
one
occasion
and
fully
intend
on
never
letting
that
happen
again.
I
have
found
that
my
difficulties
lie
not
in
grasping
the
material
or
conveying
it
clearly
and
concisely
enough
but
rather
in
accumulating
a
far
greater
array
of
resources
and
information
and
producing
an
assignment
in
a
shorter
period
of
time.
My
challenge
lies
in
learning
to
spread
out
my
work
load
more
efficiently
so
that
the
quality
of
my
writing
doesn't
suffer
due
to
a
lack
of
time.
I
can
say
that
as
a
current
history
major,
writing
has
taken
on
center
stage
in
my
academic
life.
I
have
found
that
writing
in
the
history
department
has
been
a
demanding
challenge,
what
with
trying
to
analyze,
cite
and
combine
endless
amounts
of
information
into
a
coherent
and
meaningful
essay
that
actually
has
a
message
and
point.
It
can
be
a
very
daunting
task
but
it
has
helped
me
better
grasp
the
importance
and
utility
of
constructing
a
central
theme
or
thesis.
More
than
once
it
has
seemed
nearly
impossible
to
develop
one
but
I
have
grown
much
in
that
department,
finding
that
my
thesis
might
not
even
be
discovered
until
the
essay
is
nearly
complete.
This
might
sound
like
the
wrong
way
of
going
about
the
writing
process,
but
it
works
for
me
and
has
even
been
suggested
by
a
few
teachers.
This
is
not
to
say
that
I
delve
into
an
assignment
blindly,
hoping
to
find
some
footing
later
on.
I
have
found
that
essay
writing
is
not
possible
without
some
form
of
direction
to
keep
me
in
line
and
in
focus.
I
rely
on
outlines
and
notes
to
form
that
direction
and
have
learned
to
be
patient
with
the
construction
of
a
thesis
statement.
I
map
out
a
direction
and
as
I
write,
I
form
new
ideas
that
I
can
always
find
a
way
to
tie
together.
I
think
this
would
be
an
important
message
for
all
students,
especially
those
seeking
help
from
a
WA.
So
many
times
I
have
heard
that
students
come
to
those
meetings
unprepared
because
they
are
unable
to
come
up
with
a
thesis.
The
thesis
statement
can
catch
people
off
guard
and
cause
frustration.
It
does
for
me
on
occasion.
Instead
of
concentrating
on
the
beginning,
start
thinking
about
the
middle
and
the
end-
it
may
lead
back
to
a
beginning
never
even
thought
of.
I
am
happy
to
say
that
I
have
taken
up
writing
as
a
hobby
in
recent
years.
I
would
even
consider
myself
a
student
of
writing.
I
have
repeatedly
asked
other
students
to
critique
my
own
essays
and
have
been
asked
to
do
the
same
in
return.
I
have
sought
out
fellow
students
and
asked
to
borrow
samples
of
their
writing,
just
to
see
what
kinds
of
things
they
do
differently
that
might
give
me
some
insight
as
to
how
I
can
become
a
better
writer.
I
have
even
skimmed
through
some
old
term
papers
that
teachers
have
suggested
to
gain
some
ideas
about
the
structure
a
certain
assignment
should
take.
I
think
it
is
this
willingness
to
look
for
new
ideas
is
what
has
made
me
the
writer
that
I
am
today.
