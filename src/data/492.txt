My
Personal
Writing
History
For
as
long
as
I
can
remember,
writing
has
played
an
important
role
in
my
life.
It
was
one
of
my
strengthsiasomething
I
knew
I
could
feel
good
aboutiaand
it
was
one
of
my
releasesiasomething
I
knew
would
make
me
feel
better.
Not
only
in
school,
but
on
my
own,
Iuve
grown
up
through
writing.
I
can
look
back
at
my
stacks
of
writing
binders,
notebooks,
and
journals,
and
relive
how
Iuve
become
who
I
am.
I
began
writing
towards
the
end
of
kindergarten
and
learned
to
convey
my
thoughts
through
writing
at
a
very
early
age:
rdonut
forget
my
tooth
but
still
give
me
my
dollar.
Love
Allison.
to
the
tooth
fairy.
I
Love
you
A
Lot.s
So
I
was
a
little
confused
about
format
and
capitalizationiabut
I
got
my
message
across.
I
was
in
the
full
swing
of
things
by
first
grade,
writing
weekly
science
journals
which
described
experiments
we
had
done
and
making
my
first
fully
illustrated
and
bound
story
called
rGarfield
and
Odie.s
Thereus
a
bit
of
a
gap
in
my
memory
until
third
grade,
when
I
wrote
my
first
poem.
It
was
called
rMy
Poems
and
I
was
extremely
proud
of
it.
I
showed
it
to
my
teacher
who
put
a
giraffe
sticker
on
it
(yes,
I
still
remember
the
sticker).
rMy
Poems
is
the
first
page
in
a
collection
of
several
3-ring
binders
which
include
pages
upon
pages
of
my
personal
and
academic
childhood
writing.
I
had
also
kept
some
third
grade
narrative
stories
and
a
few
poems,
but
the
work
that
stands
out
the
most
in
my
mind
is
another
illustrated
book
about
a
frog
named
Lily.
I
remember
my
teacher
handing
me
back
the
graded
version
of
the
story,
on
which
she
made
a
single
correction
which
bothered
me
very
much.
I
wrote
that
Lily
had
rscarfed
downs
her
lunchiaa
slang
term
meaning
she
ate
it
extremely
fastiabut
my
teacher
crossed
it
out
and
wrote
rscoffed
down.s
I
remember
getting
very
angry
because
I
knew
that
that
was
not
the
word
I
meant.
I
had
said
it
the
right
way
and
she
just
didnut
understand
what
I
was
trying
to
say.
This
is
a
problem
Ium
sure
is
not
unique
to
my
own
experience
and
which
didnut
just
stop
with
Lily
and
her
lunch.
Knowing
what
you
want
to
say,
yet
being
unable
to
convey
it,
is
a
frustration
that
has
affected
all
writers
throughout
their
writing
careers.
How
you
deal
with
thisianot
getting
mad
at
Mrs.
DelGrego
but
instead
working
out
a
better
way
to
convey
what
you
meaniais
the
important
part,
and
one
that
Iuve
worked
on
since
rthe
Lily
incident.s
Fourth
grade
marked
the
beginning
of
a
deeper
interest
in
poetry.
In
my
binder
are
dozens
of
poems,
the
majority
of
which
were
modeled
after
the
silly
writing
style
of
Shel
Silverstein.
Some
were
assignments
for
school
but
most
were
written
on
my
own
time.
I
donut
remember
showing
many
of
them
to
anyone,
although
I
had
planned
to
type
them
all
up
to
be
put
into
my
own
book
of
poetry
to
share.
Fifth
grade
brought
about
more
poems;
however,
their
content
was
more
emotional
rather
than
silly.
Fifth
grade
also
marked
the
beginning
of
timed
writing
prompts,
a
task
which
I
can
honestly
say
I
despised.
I
always
did
well,
getting
a
5
or
6
out
of
6
on
the
scoring
rubric,
but
I
hated
the
pressure
of
a
time
limit,
especially
since
it
was
a
random
topic
that
was
thrown
at
me.
I
remember
wondering
how
such
a
rushed
and
random
exercise
was
at
all
like
real
life
writing.
A
less
rushed,
yet
still
very
much
time-sensitive
assignment
from
fifth
grade
was
our
final
research
paper.
Everything
was
on
a
timetableiachoosing
a
topic,
finding
research
materials,
writing
down
questions
I
wanted
answerediaall
had
a
deadline,
to
help
spread
out
what
felt
like
an
overwhelming
process.
This
is
a
method
I
have
tried
to
carry
with
me
throughout
the
yearsiataking
assignments
bit
by
bit
and
keeping
things
organized
to
avoid
the
night-before-cram.
I
did
my
paper
on
the
concentration
campsiamy
first
serious
writing
topic.
My
teacher
gave
me
an
A
and
acknowledged
the
courage
it
took
to
write
about
such
a
difficult
subject.
These
types
of
research
papers,
as
well
as
essay
arguments,
became
more
frequent.
The
setup
of
an
essay
with
an
introduction,
three
main
points,
and
a
conclusion
was
drilled
into
our
heads.
Ium
both
thankful
for
and
resentful
of
learning
this
cookie-cutter
approach
to
writing.
I
knew
it
was
necessary
to
get
us
writing
in
a
consistent
and
organized
manner,
but
it
always
felt
so
mechanical.
By
then,
writing
on
my
own
had
become
a
favorite
hobby.
I
was
constantly
writing
stories
in
my
free
time,
mostly
narratives
written
in
the
first
person
of
girls
growing
up
and
dealing
with
the
difficulties
in
their
lives.
It
was
my
way
of
venturing
into
worlds
older
and
more
complicated
than
mine.
I
must
have
started
about
a
dozen,
but
never
finished
any
or
showed
them
to
anyone.
In
school
the
prompts
became
more
frequent
and
so
did
the
personal
narratives.
One
narrative
that
stands
out
in
my
mind
is
one
I
wrote
about
a
camping
trip
I
took
with
my
family
and
two
other
families
to
a
place
called
Burr
Pond.
I
received
an
A
for
it,
but
more
importantly,
going
back
and
reading
it
helped
me
cope
with
the
loss
of
a
friend
who
was
on
that
trip
with
me.
I
had
written
another
narrative
later
in
seventh
grade
when
he
became
sick
and
during
the
difficult
times
surrounding
his
illness
and
eventually
his
passing,
it
was
a
real
source
of
peace
to
be
able
to
feel
the
fun
we
had
again
through
my
writing.
My
favorite
kind
of
writing,
as
shown
through
the
writing
I
did
on
my
own,
was
creative
writing.
I
loved
the
freedom.
rLost
Times
was
a
short
story
I
wrote
in
fifth
grade
as
well,
which
received
comments
such
as
rgreat
description,s
rnice
touch,s
rgood
word,s
and
rexcellent
job
developing
setting
and
characters.s
I
got
an
A
on
the
story,
however,
the
ending,
which
involved
an
Epilogue,
was
marked
as
rconfusing.s
The
rLily
Problems
had
appeared
againiaknowing
how
I
wanted
to
resolve
the
mystery
of
the
story,
but
not
being
able
to
present
it
so
that
the
reader
could
understand
my
train
of
thought.
I
remember
not
even
being
happy
with
the
grade
because
I
was
so
frustrated
that
I
didnut
piece
the
ending
together
in
a
clear
enough
manner,
and
in
a
mystery
story,
that
was
the
most
important
part.
My
writing
always
seemed
to
be
well
received
by
my
teachers.
When
I
entered
junior
high
in
7th
Grade,
I
received
comments
on
a
legend
I
was
assigned
to
write
such
as,
rnice
beginning,s
rgood
suspense,s
and
rexcellent
style.s
A
first
day
8th
Grade
free-writing
assignment
yielded
a,
rYou
are
an
excellent
writer!
Nice
work.s
Although
I
kept
it
to
myself,
I
was
proud
of
my
writing
ability.
Everyone
has
their
rthingsiaand
writing
was
mine.
I
continued
writing
poetry
from
junior
high
into
high
school,
but
its
style
and
themes
had
changed
drastically.
Poetry
had
become
my
coping
method.
My
poems
were
increasingly
personal
and
since
it
was
an
emotional
release
for
me,
mostly
dealt
with
more
difficult
topics
like
heartbreak
and
the
usual
inner
turmoil
teenagers
tend
to
feel.
Apparently
there
was
no
more
room
for
Shel
Silverstein
in
my
poetryiaI
was
growing
up.
I
wound
up
entering
one
of
my
poems
to
my
high
school
literary
magazine.
Since
I
was
part
of
the
group
I
was
there
when
it
was
critiqued
and
was
extremely
pleased
with
the
feedback.
The
group
loved
its
imagery
and
theme,
and
it
was
published
in
the
end-of-the-year
magazine.
High
school
brought
about
more
challenging
writing
assignments.
I
was
in
the
rdreaded
English
teacherus
classs
my
freshman
year,
and
although
it
was
challenging
and
frustrating
at
times,
when
I
look
back
I
am
grateful
for
the
preparation
it
gave
me
for
the
years
to
come.
Despite
questions
on
tests
such
as,
rWhat
time
did
it
say
on
the
clock
when
such-and-such
happened
in
Great
Expectations?s
the
essays
which
we
were
given
on
tests
for
works
such
as
Romeo
and
Juliet,
Great
Expectations,
and
To
Kill
A
Mockingbird
taught
me
to
really
analyze
information
and
make
deeper
connections
instead
of
simply
looking
at
the
surface
of
the
works.
Freshman
year
was
a
little
rough
on
my
pride
because
I
was
used
to
being
the
best
at
writingiaI
had
never
struggled
in
it
before.
Seeing
a
B+
at
the
end
of
an
essay
was
horrifying
for
me.
Swallowing
my
pride
and
learning
from
my
mistakes
were
big
lessons
I
had
to
learn
freshman
year.
My
favorite
assignments
in
high
school
were
creative
ones
in
which
I
had
to
adapt
my
writing
style,
tone,
and
language
to
fit
the
novel
or
play
we
were
reading.
For
example,
writing
an
alternative
ending
to
The
Scarlet
Letter
in
old
English
or
creating
an
additional
episode
for
The
Adventures
of
Huckleberry
Finn
in
Huckus
playful
voice
and
southern
twang,
were
two
assignments
I
truly
enjoyed.
My
worst
writing
experience
came
about
in
my
sophomore
year,
when
I
took
a
test
in
order
to
get
into
Junior
Year
AP
English.
I
was
unable
to
attend
the
exam
and
was
given
a
different
makeup
test
shortly
afterwards.
I
panicked
under
the
pressure
and
time
limit,
continually
thinking,
rWhat
if
I
donut
get
in?s
My
own
nerves
and
expectations
for
myself
kept
me
from
writing
the
way
I
was
capable,
and
I
did
not
get
into
the
class.
Needless
to
say
I
was
extremely
disappointed.
AP
English
my
senior
year
brought
with
it
a
wide
array
of
authors
and
genres
and
was
a
class
I
enjoyed.
I
found
myself
actually
liking
Shakespeare
and
began
to
appreciate
the
intricacy
of
his
works.
It
was
the
first
time
I
was
really
asked
to
analyze
tone
and
style,
especially
during
the
poetry
section
of
the
class,
which
in
turn
helped
me
with
my
own
poetry.
We
analyzed
the
ins
and
outs
of
every
work,
and
Heart
of
Darkness
was
one
of
the
densest
novels
I
had
ever
read.
It
was
a
taxing,
but
interesting
job
to
pick
its
many
symbols
and
connections
apart.
My
teacher
liked
my
writing
on
essay
tests
and
short
response
papers,
acknowledging
connections
I
made
in
critically
analyzing
the
material.
By
this
point
I
had
three
journals
filled
with
my
own
poetry
and
thoughts.
Some
rhyming,
some
completely
unorganized,
some
in
such
terrible
handwriting
I
can
hardly
read
them,
some
happy,
some
filled
with
anguish,
some
in
Spanish,
but
all
straight
from
the
heart.
Those
pages
helped
me
through
a
lot
of
difficult
times,
and
shared
a
lot
of
triumphs
and
happiness
with
me.
I
knew
no
matter
what
happened,
my
pen
and
paper
would
always
be
there
for
me,
and
they
have
been
an
important
part
of
reminding
me
how
Iuve
come
to
be
the
person
I
am
today.
I
will
admit
I
was
scared
when
I
came
to
college.
Half
of
me
thought,
rIum
a
good
writer
Ium
going
to
do
well,s
while
the
other
half
of
me
thought,
rPrepare
yourself
for
a
big
slap
in
the
face.s
My
first
paper
was
assigned
in
my
FYS
and
it
was
a
difficult
writing
process.
The
assignment
was
broad
and
poorly
defined
and
I
remember
my
entire
class
feeling
lost.
However,
when
I
met
with
my
WA
she
assured
me
I
was
going
in
the
right
direction
and
we
worked
on
how
I
could
improve.
I
got
an
A
on
the
paper
which
helped
boost
my
confidence
as
I
moved
ahead
in
the
realm
of
college
writing.
I
was
also
hit
freshman
year
with
a
challenge
in
a
Political
Theory
class,
when
I
was
asked
to
write
a
theoretical
paperiathe
format
of
which
was
completely
new
to
me.
Until
college
I
had
a
very
difficult
time
asking
for
help
on
writing
assignments,
but
in
this
class
I
knew
I
was
going
to
need
as
much
feedback
and
help
as
possible.
I
met
with
my
professor
during
the
draft
process,
and
although
I
was
unsure
along
the
way,
the
paper
turned
out
well.
A
copy
of
it
was
even
placed
in
the
Kirby
Library
as
a
sample
to
other
unsure
theory
students.
My
First
Amendment
class,
however,
brought
about
my
biggest
writing
challenges
and
successes.
As
David
Bartholomaeus
article
discusses,
I
was
asked
to
step
into
a
new
voiceiaa
voice
extremely
unfamiliar
to
me.
The
assignment
required
that
I
become
a
Supreme
Court
Justice
ruling
on
a
case
involving
the
first
amendment.
I
had
read
few
formal
judgeus
opinions
in
the
past
and
was
now
being
asked
to
write
one.
I
felt
completely
lost
and
had
no
idea
where
to
start.
I
remember
wondering
if
anyone
else
in
the
class
felt
like
that
too.
I
worked
for
days
organizing
my
thoughtsiahow
to
use
the
details
in
the
hypothetical
case,
what
my
majority
and
dissenting
opinions
would
consist
of,
which
cases
I
would
need
to
use
as
precedent.
Once
I
finally
decided
I
had
done
enough
planning
I
dove
into
writing
the
majority
opinion
and
really
surprised
myself.
Not
only
were
the
words
flowing,
but
they
were
coming
out
in
a
style
which
very
closely
resembled
that
of
the
judgesu
opinions
I
had
read.
My
paper
was
close
to
15
pages
and
I
canut
tell
you
how
many
times
I
read
and
re-read
it.
I
was
not
only
proud
of
that
paper
but
once
I
got
going
I
truly
enjoyed
writing
it.
The
three
papers
I
was
assigned
for
that
class
were,
as
a
whole,
my
best
writing
experiences;
however,
I
must
say
that
the
100
I
received
on
one
of
them
holds
a
special
place
in
my
writing
career.
Writing
has
always
been
an
important
part
of
my
academic
and
personal
life,
and
as
a
law
school
hopeful
and
a
Spanish
double
major,
Ium
sure
it
will
continue
to
beiain
two
languages!
Despite
my
frustrations
and
setbacks,
I
have
continued
to
write
and
strive
to
improve,
and
I
know
that
much
more
lies
ahead
in
my
writing
career.
Moreover,
I
hope
that
through
the
WA
program
I
can
become
a
positive
part
of
someone
elseus
personal
writing
history,
and
they
can
become
a
part
of
mine.
