Pacing
the
Tiles
August
14,
1999
My
head
was
pounding
as
I
slowly
rocked
back
and
forth
on
my
heals
with
my
knees
tucked
tight
against
my
chin.
The
utter
blandness
of
the
bone
colored
walls
that
surrounded
me
seemed
to
be
mere
reflections
of
the
dullness
of
my
thoughts.
I
leaped
from
the
corner
of
my
bed
onto
the
hard,
cold
floor
in
an
attempt
to
jump
start
my
brain.
Nothing
was
working.
I
spent
an
eternity
pacing
the
eight
square
tiles
between
my
closet
and
my
desk.
It
had
been
three
days
since
I
received
the
dreadful
news;
I
had
one
week
to
produce
a
paper
on
the
topic
of
my
choice.
I
can
think
of
no
greater
torture
than
such
open-ended
assignments.
As
I
completed
my
thirteenth
lap
of
my
tiny
dorm
room,
I
vowed
to
one
day
leave
the
agony
of
creative
writing
behind.
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
be
exposed
to
a
wide
diversity
of
writing
styles
and
formats,
but
creative
writing
has
always
been
incredibly
challenging
for
me.
A
three
page
lab
report
is
a
stroll
around
the
block
compared
to
the
exhausting
marathon
that
follows
a
creative
writing
assignment
of
the
same
length.
The
technical
writing
process
has
been
easy
for
me;
assignments
with
less
structure
cause
me
great
aggravation.
With
each
additional
element
of
freedom,
I
bang
my
head
against
a
few
more
walls
as
I
rip
out
a
few
more
handfuls
of
hair.
Although
I
ultimately
have
more
pride
in
most
of
my
creative
writings
than
any
lab
report
I
have
ever
produced,
I
did
not
shed
any
tears
at
the
thought
of
leaving
my
days
of
creative
writing
assignments
in
the
past.
I
walked
out
of
First
Year
Writing
and
into
the
science-oriented
schedule
of
my
sophomore
year
with
visions
of
remaining
safe
within
the
confines
of
structured
reports
and
memos.
I
was
wrong.
In
my
quest
to
move
beyond
assignments
that
did
not
include
a
pre-defined
format,
I
could
not
have
been
happier
to
be
assigned
as
a
writing
associate
for
a
first
year
seminar
that
focused
on
science
and
technology.
I
was
confident
in
my
ability
to
help
the
students
in
that
the
type
of
writing
that
would
be
required
of
them
was
the
style
with
which
I
was
most
experienced
and
believed
to
be
most
simplistic.
I
later
discovered
that
the
ease
with
which
the
writing
came
for
me
could
be
as
much
of
a
burden
as
a
benefit
and
that
simplicity
lies
in
the
eyes
of
the
author.
I
had
anticipated
the
challenges
of
working
with
students
from
drastically
different
levels
of
writing
abilities
and
educational
backgrounds,
but
I
had
not
recognized
the
challenges
that
would
arise
for
students
with
no
experience
or
even
interest
in
technical
writing.
I
only
truly
began
to
understand
their
struggles
as
I
attempted
to
compose
my
first
philosophy
paper.
Although
my
schedule
was
filled
with
science
and
engineering
courses,
one
humanities
elective
somehow
ended
up
on
my
list
of
classes.
I
had
mistakenly
overlooked
the
significance
of
my
Philosophy
105
Ethics
Course
when
I
predicted
a
painless
year
of
writing
for
my
sophomore
year.
Merely
comprehending
the
general
theme
of
what
the
professor
was
talking
about
took
all
of
my
concentration
and
focus.
The
ideas
and
arguments
were
abstract
to
the
point
of
absurdity
in
my
mind
and
producing
a
paper
which
coherently
defended
a
side
of
one
of
these
debates
was
nearly
impossible
for
me.
I
was
in
awe
of
the
philosophy
majors
who
so
effortlessly
drafted
their
papers
the
night
before
the
deadlines.
I
longed
for
the
concrete
style
of
the
scientific
writing
to
which
I
was
accustomed.
I
felt
like
I
was
learning
to
write
in
a
new
language
for
the
first
time.
Suddenly
I
realized
that
was
how
so
many
of
the
first
year
students
must
feel
in
facing
technical
writing
for
the
first
time.
Although
it
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
courses
I
have
taken
to
date,
my
ethics
class
made
me
both
a
better
writer
and
a
better
writing
associate.
The
course
not
only
strengthened
my
writing
abilities
by
exposing
me
to
the
writing
style
of
a
new
discipline,
but
gave
me
a
new
level
of
understanding
and
appreciation
for
students
who
lack
experience
with
technical
writing.
My
utter
lack
of
direction
in
applying
ethical
theories
mirrored
the
students'
confusion
in
incorporating
calculations
and
statistics
into
their
papers.
These
enlightening
reflections
prompted
me
to
attempt
to
provide
the
guidance
that
I
was
seeking
in
my
own
writing.
Ultimately,
my
confidence
in
my
abilities
as
a
writing
associate
were
strengthened
not
by
my
competency
in
writing
as
an
engineer,
but
in
my
inadequacies
in
writing
as
a
philosopher.
The
lessons
I
learned
throughout
the
writing
experiences
of
my
first
semester
were
crucial
to
my
success
as
a
writing
associate
second
semester.
I
was
again
assigned
to
a
course
which
required
very
scientific
writing
which
a
majority
of
the
students
enrolled
found
foreign
and
bizarre.
This
time
I
was
able
to
foresee
the
problems
and
help
solve
the
difficulties
that
arose
for
students
who
were
facing
a
new
discipline
for
the
first
time.
However,
there
were
students
in
the
class
who
were
very
skilled
and
experienced
in
technical
writing,
and
I
soon
found
that
these
conferences
would
be
my
most
challenging.
These
students
were
often
very
confident
in
their
writing
and
often
unwilling
to
listen
to
the
advice
I
had
to
offer.
Again,
I
found
my
experiences
in
my
own
writing
course
to
be
very
relevant
to
the
students
that
I
was
trying
to
help.
However,
this
time
my
experiences
did
not
influence
how
I
handled
the
conferences
as
much
as
the
conferences
altered
my
behavior
as
a
writer.
Throughout
my
years
of
high
school
writing,
my
greatest
obstacle
was
the
revision
process.
Whether
I
was
receiving
constructive
criticism
from
a
teacher
or
just
knew
deep
down
that
my
focus
was
not
quite
right,
I
often
grew
far
too
attached
to
the
temporary
words
of
first
drafts.
I
suffered
great
pains
in
watching
the
cursor
swallow
up
the
letters
I
had
so
carefully
typed,
and
I
frequently
fought
to
keep
irrelevant
sentences
or
misplaced
phrases
within
my
papers
just
because
I
could
not
bare
to
part
with
them.
I
thought
the
relentless
revision
processes
that
I
was
forced
to
endure
throughout
the
writing
courses
of
my
freshmen
year
had
cured
me
of
my
disease.
Time
and
time
again
I
saw
the
benefits
of
heeding
the
advice
of
other
readers,
and
the
incredible
difference
in
quality
of
my
tenth
draft
as
compared
to
the
original
composition
proved
beyond
a
doubt
that
the
tediousness
of
revisions
are
worthwhile.
However,
as
I
faced
the
assignments
of
my
sophomore
writing
course,
I
was
haunted
by
my
former,
stubborn,
writing
self.
The
second
semester
writing
course
of
my
sophomore
year
was
the
first
time
I
would
be
required
to
meet
with
a
writing
associate
since
I
had
become
one.
The
WA
for
my
course
had
taken
the
course
himself
and
was
majoring
in
the
same
field
as
me.
So,
I
was
looking
forward
to
receiving
advice
from
such
a
skilled
reader.
However,
as
I
sat
down
for
my
first
conference
as
the
''student,"
I
found
myself
slipping
into
a
trap
from
which
I
believed
I
had
been
set
free
long
ago.
I
cringed
at
the
blocks
of
red
suggestions
splattered
throughout
the
pages
of
my
paper
and
silently
argued
with
each
critical
remark.
Later,
as
I
began
my
revision
process,
I
found
the
temptation
to
keep
paragraphs
that
the
writing
associate
had
deemed
extraneous
to
be
overwhelming.
Only
as
I
thought
back
to
the
conferences
that
I
had
conducted
as
a
writing
associate
did
I
allow
the
cursor
to
swallow
my
letters.
I
had
often
been
amazed
at
the
students
who
seemed
so
uninterested
in
the
help
I
had
to
offer.
They
were
not
intentionally
disrespectful,
but
through
wandering
eyes
and
vacant
nodding
heads
they
clearly
relayed
the
message
that
they
were
not
really
listening
to
my
words
and
had
no
intentions
of
following
through
with
any
of
the
suggested
revisions.
I
found
it
difficult
to
understand
why
the
students
would
be
so
unwilling
to
accept
the
help
I
offered
for
the
papers
that
to
me
seemed
obviously
unfocused
or
disconnected.
I
soon
realized
the
significance
of
a
new
perspective
in
reviewing
papers.
I
again
acknowledged
my
good
fortune
in
having
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
such
a
knowledgeable
reader,
and
I
vowed
not
be
another
nodding
head.
Through
all
of
the
shattered
expectations
and
surprising
revelations
of
my
self
as
a
writer
throughout
the
past
year,
the
aspect
that
I
would
have
been
most
shocked
by
one
year
ago
lies
between
a
dictionary
and
a
high
school
year
book
on
my
bedroom
book
shelf.
Somewhere
between
the
moment
on
Christmas
morning
when
I
freed
the
pale
blue
book
from
its
shiny
wrappings
and
the
moment
I
placed
that
same
journal
in
the
bottom
of
a
cardboard
box
as
I
left
my
dorm
room
for
the
last
time,
I
had
become
the
writer
I
had
sworn
I
would
never
be.
I
not
only
fell
into
the
habit
of
making
regular
entries,
but
I
became
dependent
on
those
writings
to
clear
my
head
and
organize
my
thoughts.
The
pages
were
not
filled
with
organized,
coherent
paragraphs;
they
contrasted
my
preferential
writing
style
in
every
way
possible.
When
writing
in
that
journal
I
traded
in
my
mechanical
pencils
for
fluorescent
markers.
I
ignored
the
designated
lines
and
often
felt
the
need
to
write
diagonally
across
the
pages.
The
random
thoughts
and
poems
ideas
and
doodles
have
no
assigned
spaces;
the
creations
and
colors
intertwine.
The
pages
ooze
of
the
unrestricted
creativity
that
would
have
caused
me
to
rip
out
my
hair
just
one
year
ago.
Now,
I
depend
on
the
unstructured
form
of
expression
to
keep
me
sane.
As
a
writer,
I
have
learned
to
expect
the
unexpected
and
assume
nothing.
Every
perception
I
had
of
myself
as
a
writer
was
shattered
throughout
the
past
year.
Ironically,
my
weaknesses
in
writing
in
unfamiliar
disciplines
helped
me
to
become
a
better
writing
associate,
and
my
most
awkward
writing
conferences
with
nonchalant
students
made
me
a
better
writer.
I
ultimately
became
reliant
on
the
free
writing
I
had
run
from
for
so
long
to
organize
my
thoughts
enough
to
produce
the
structured
type
of
writing
that
I
had
always
viewed
as
a
safety
net.
While
I
still
prefer
lab
reports
to
assignments
with
no
restrictions,
I
have
come
to
the
realization
that
the
benefits
that
I
obtain
in
expanding
my
abilities
as
a
writer
are
worth
the
struggle
of
climbing
out
of
the
safety
net
long
enough
to
pace
the
tiles
of
my
dorm
room.
