MY
PARTING
WORDS
Lafayette
College
Writing
Associate
Assignment
August
16,
1997
The
implicit
meanings
of
a
piece
of
writing
are
the
tip
of
an
iceberg
of
meaning;
the
larger
part
lies
below
the
surface
of
the
text
and
is
composed
of
the
reader's
own
relevant
knowledge
(E.
D.
Hirsch,
Jr.).
Hirsch
contends
that
this
lack
of
relevant
knowledge
in
individuals
is
the
cause
of
illiteracy.
I
contend
that
lack
of
relevant
knowledge
is
also
the
cause
of
many
frustrations
in
the
writing
process.
Obstacles
often
arise
when
a
writer
attempts
to
apply
his/her
background
knowledge
to
pertinent
documents.
This
can
cause
a
writer
to
state
little
more
than
the
explicit
meaning
of
these
documents
that
were
researched.
Over
the
past
year
I
have
discovered
this
burdensome
problem
as
a
writer
and
Writing
Associate.
Encountering
this
problem
has
prolonged
my
journey
down
the
road
that
I
have
taken.
Offering
advice
on
ways
to
remedy
this
frustrating
situation
that
writers
face
has
become
my
focus.
This
has
always
given
me
the
opportunity
to
offer
my
parting
words
on
my
experiences
this
past
year
as
a
writer
and
WA.
My
Fall
semester
courses
enabled
me
to
realize
the
troubles
that
a
writer
can
experience
firsthand.
My
Transport
lab
course
is
one
particular
course
that
I
remember.
In
many
ways,
Transport
lab
was
like
starting
school
all
over
again.
Lab
reports
had
a
specific
form
with
certain
guidelines
and
requirements
.
One
of
these
requirements
was
the
statistical
analysis
of
data
that
had
to
be
incorporated
into
the
report.
Experimental
design
was
another
important
factor
that
required
insight
on
how
to
randomize
and
replicate
data
to
provide
better
data
analysis.
On
top
of
this,
was
the
required
need
to
utilize
and
master
computer
programs
like
Microsoft
Excel
and
Minitab.
Initially
this
course
was
overwhelming.
My
trepidation
was
due
to
my
lack
of
relevant
knowledge
and
the
urgent
need
to
acquire
it
while
meeting
the
demands
of
other
courses.
Furthermore,
this
situation
offered
no
quick
remedy,
just
the
scientific
way
of
extensive
hours
of
trial
and
error.
As
my
first
lab
report
rapidly
approached,
I
had
progressed
in
learning
the
computer
programs
*
the
essential
tools
of
the
lab.
This
progress
was
a
necessary
ingredient
to
the
writing
process.
Before
I
could
write
about
the
experiment,
I
needed
perform
statistical
analysis
on
the
data
collected.
Only
then
was
it
possible
to
really
comment
on
the
lab.
Statistical
analysis
required
several
hours
to
complete
though.
After
completing
this
task,
I
began
to
write
the
first
draft
of
my
lab
report.
I
followed
the
specific
format
demanded
by
describing
the
background
information,
lab
equipment,
and
lab
procedure.
Then
I
started
to
write
the
results
and
discussion
section.
I
began
by
pondering
(as
many
writers
do)
how
I
was
going
to
begin
the
section
and
incorporate
the
statistical
analysis.
This
section
was
very
frustrating
to
write.
Much
thought
and
time
was
required
to
overcome
this
section.
With
some
guidance,
I
was
able
to
figure
out
what
the
statistical
analysis
meant.
This
enlightenment
and
newly
acquired
relevant
knowledge
allowed
me
to
complete
the
results
and
discussion
section.
Upon
receiving
my
first
draft
back,
I
realized
that
an
experiment
is
continuous
and
does
not
end.
The
feedback
from
my
draft
reinforced
this
concept.
The
next
step
was
to
further
investigate
the
lab
design
and
equipment,
suggest
improvements,
and
to
carry
out
further
trials.
This
information
was
then
used
to
accentuate
the
discussion
of
the
lab
results.
This
further
investigation
enabled
me
to
expose
the
weaknesses
of
the
lab
(which
I
lacked
relevant
knowledge
about)
and
provide
explanation.
More
importantly,
this
analysis
and
lab
experiment
provided
me
background
information
to
ease
the
burdens
of
future
lab
reports.
This
experience
made
me
realize
the
importance
of
providing
insight
and
a
new
perspective
to
aid
others
in
understanding
the
relevant
knowledge
for
a
particular
topic.
This
experience
made
me
realize
the
importance
of
being
a
Writing
Associate.
My
new
awakening
as
a
WA
provided
me
with
the
chance
to
impart
relevant
knowledge
and
insight
in
my
meetings.
I
looked
forward
to
my
first
meetings
with
anticipation.
One
main
objective
in
each
meeting
was
to
attempt
to
help
each
student
understand
the
importance
of
background
information
-
relevant
knowledge.
I
focused
on
areas
of
each
student's
paper
that
required
further
investigation,
and
the
need
to
go
beyond
the
explicit
information
found
in
sources.
In
the
meetings,
the
student
and
I
discussed
these
areas
and
how
to
make
improvements.
We
also
discussed
how
increased
background
information
enables
one
to
provide
a
better
argument
and
even
critique
the
finer
points
of
an
opposing
(possibly
majoritarian)
view.
As
students
begin
to
realize
that
further
information
could
enhance
the
argument
of
a
paper,
students
spent
more
time
doing
research
from
different
perspectives.
Instead
of
looking
at
part
of
the
big
picture,
students
began
to
look
from
different
angles
of
understanding
to
see
more
of
the
big
picture.
The
student
began
to
realize
that
the
writing
process
is
a
continuing
process
of
investigation
and
revision
much
like
a
lab
experiment.
I
think
many
students
write
papers
with
the
misconception
that
after
they
have
done
research
for
their
paper
the
first
time,
they
are
finished
doing
research.
As
a
WA,
I
focused
on
dispelling
this
myth
and
emphasizing
the
importance
of
obtaining
more
information
to
improve
a
paper.
The
successive
drafts
of
the
students
improved,
and
seemed
more
interesting
and
thought-provoking.
My
next
lab
report
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
implement
and
improve
this
approach
in
my
writing
process.
After
completing
the
steps
that
I
had
taken
in
the
previous
lab,
I
researched
the
models
and
their
assumptions
that
I
was
using
to
compare
with
my
experimental
data.
I
learned
that
the
particular
assumptions
of
a
model
are
crucial
in
comparing
data.
Often
discrepancies
in
comparing
data
result
from
these
assumptions
not
being
met
in
the
lab
experiment.
As
a
result,
it
is
necessary
to
provide
explanations
and
statistics
to
postulate
why
certain
assumptions
were
not
met.
Other
models
can
also
be
used
to
compare
data
and
obtain
more
information
about
the
lab
experiment.
This
notion
of
seeking
more
information
enabled
me
to
obtain
more
results
to
include
in
my
lab
report.
The
final
lab
report
was
well
over
ten
pages,
with
detailed
analysis.
I
ended
up
receiving
a
good
grade
on
a
lab
report
that
I
initially
dreaded.
My
success
motivated
me
to
continue
to
sharpen
the
skills
of
others
at
understanding
the
conitinuing
writing
process.
In
the
second
round
of
conferences,
I
continued
to
build
from
what
I
had
achieved
in
previous
meetings.
I
specifically
focused
on
analyzing
papers
from
an
opposing
viewpoint.
Then
I
presented
the
counter
arguments
to
each
student,
challenging
him/her
to
seek
information
to
expose
the
weaknesses
of
these
arguments.
The
counter
arguments
also
led
me
to
direct
the
attention
of
each
student
to
the
weaknesses
in
his/her
argument
that
an
opposing
view
would
expose.
Then
I
encouraged
each
student
to
integrate
this
information
to
strengthen
his/her
paper.
This
challenge
of
each
meeting
was
the
ultimate
for
each
student.
I
was
able
to
comfort
pose
this
challenge
to
these
upper-class
students
who
were
proficient
writers.
The
upperclassmen
were
responsive
to
the
challenge
as
well,
and
began
to
realize
that
a
piece
of
writing
is
never
finished.
My
Spring
semester
courses
offered
me
a
new
experience
as
a
writer.
Unit
Operations
lab
still
provided
me
with
lab
reports
and
presentations
that
last
semester
had
offered.
On
the
other
hand,
my
Religion
course
provided
me
a
unique
writing
experience.
Instead
of
ten
pages
of
detailed
analysis,
I
was
asked
to
summarize
twenty
to
thirty
pages
of
text
in
a
one
page
report.
This
assignment
placed
emphasis
on
identifying
and
describing
the
relevant
knowledge
of
an
article
or
text.
My
prior
experiences
were
very
useful
in
accomplishing
this
assignment.
I
was
able
to
identify
and
examine
the
foundation
of
an
argument
in
a
text.
By
focusing
on
the
foundation
of
the
argument
and
its
main
points,
I
was
able
to
summarize
a
text
in
a
succinct
manner.
I
did
not
allow
the
fear
of
describing
thirty
pages
of
text
in
only
one
page
overcome
me.
Instead,
I
condensed
the
text
to
its
main
points
(like
letters
are
combined
to
form
words)
to
present
the
relevant
knowledge
of
the
text
in
a
one
page
report.
This
unique
writing
experience
made
me
realize
the
importance
of
not
only
understanding
the
relevant
knowledge
of
a
text,
but
identifying
this
relevant
knowledge
as
well.
My
Spring
semester
WA
conferences
allowed
me
to
reinforce
this
concept
to
the
students
of
an
engineering
VAST
course
entitled
Professionalism
and
Ethics.
This
course
added
further
emphasis
on
the
need
incorporate
relevant
knowledge
and
examine
an
issue
from
different
sides.
In
my
meetings
I
worked
at
trying
to
make
students
aware
of
this
concept.
I
highlighted
areas
of
their
papers
where
more
information
was
needed
to
validate
their
argument.
I
also
attempted
to
help
them
in
identifying
how
to
think
from
different
perspectives
to
aid
in
presenting
their
arguments.
These
conferences
began
to
open
the
students'
eyes
to
realize
that
the
more
background
and
knowledge
one
acquires
on
a
topic,
and
inevitably
the
farther
one
progresses
in
the
writing
process,
the
better
a
report
will
become
in
its
polished
version.
This
past
year
!
have
come
to
realize
that
a
large
part
of
writing
is
based
on
relevant
knowledge.
The
more
relevant
knowledge
one
acquires
in
a
particular
topic
and
in
general,
the
easier
a
piece
of
writing
will
be
to
create
and/or
understand.
I
had
worked
at
trying
to
increase
this
awareness
of
relevant
knowledge
for
others
as
well
as
for
me.
More
importantly,
I
have
had
some
success
as
a
WA
at
helpings
others
understand
and
acquire
the
relevant
knowledge
needed
for
a
particular
topic.
In
a
sense,
!
have
helped
students
realize
that
writing
Is
a
continuing
process
that
requires
more
than
one
attempt
at
gathering
research.
In
the
process
I
have
also
realized
the
importance
of
being
a
WA.
And
as
a
WA,
I
know
the
importance
other
communicating
and
sharing
information
for
the
benefit
of
others.
For
this
reason
I
offer
my
parting
words
for
future
writers
and
Writing
Associates.
