Summer
Writing
Assignment
Like
many
people,
I
have
not
always
liked
to
write.
English
was
not
my
favorite
subject
in
grade
school,
and
writing
papers
was
basically
an
annoyance
to
me
until
my
senior
year
in
high
school.
I
remember
learning
to
write
in
cursive
in
third
grade,
and
how
I
loved
to
practice
my
letters,
but
this
fascination
with
cursive
did
not
indicate
that
I
would
ever
apply
to
be
a
Writing
Assistant
because
I
thought
it
would
be
fun.
Just
like
everyone
else
in
my
classes,
I
complained
when
a
teacher
assigned
a
paper
that
I
thought
was
too
long
(two
hundred
words
always
seemed
like
a
perfect
length
to
me).
While
I
dreaded
these
assignments,
I
still
wrote
on
my
own
outside
of
school.
I
kept
a
daily
journal
about
my
ever-so-rough
life
as
a
sixth
grader.
I
was
quite
committed
to
it,
and
I
wrote
in
it
almost
every
day
for
years.
When
I
read
it
now,
I
laugh
hysterically
because
it
seems
like
someone
else
wrote
it
under
my
name.
I
never
really
thought
of
this
journal
as
something
that
would
fit
into
my
history
as
a
writer,
it
was
just
something
that
I
enjoyed
doing.
My
definition
of
writing
would
not
have
included
the
word
"fun"
until
recently
because
when
I
was
younger,
writing
meant
research
reports,
book
reports
or
analytical
essays.
None
of
these
types
of
writing
seemed
to
encourage
expression
or
having
fun.
Now,
I
see
that
my
early
commitment
to
my
journal
actually
began
my
writing
career.
While
the
thrill
of
writing
in
a
journal
wore
off,
a
new
interest
came
up.
I
began
to
write
poetry.
Like
the
journal,
I
did
it
on
my
own,
and
it
is
funny
to
read
now.
Unlike
the
journal,
this
is
a
hobby
that
I
have
kept
up
throughout
the
years,
although
I
never
show
it
to
anyone
because
it
is
certainly
nothing
to
be
admired.
My
feelings
about
writing
for
school
had
still
not
changed
by
the
time
I
took
up
poetry,
and
I
believe
this
is
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
my
diary
and
poetry
were
based
on
subjects
that
I
chose,
not
ones
that
my
teachers
chose
for
me.
Through
my
poetry,
I
expressed
myself
and
my
opinions,
and
even
though
no
one
has
ever
read
any
of
it,
it
is
still
a
great
release
for
me.
Perhaps
through
my
attempt
at
becoming
a
poet,
I
realized
that
release
is
what
writing
offers
authors.
However,
doing
assigned
writing
in
school
still
seemed
like
a
chore
to
me.
Where
poetry
was
a
release,
assigned
writing
was
a
hassle.
The
first
release
that
assigned
writing
offered
me
appeared
in
the
form
of
what
we
called
"Country
Reports"
in
my
Global
Studies
course
in
ninth
grade.
In
order
to
write
these
reports,
we
had
to
look
up
our
assigned
country
and
spit
out
facts
about
it,
such
as
the
literacy
rates
or
the
ratio
of
men
to
women.
These
reports
did
not
give
me
a
chance
to
express
myself,
but
they
were
definitely
an
easy
grade.
From
ninth
grade
to
my
senior
year,
"an
easy
grade"
is
what
a
writing
assignment
meant
to
me.
I
would
gladly
write
a
paper,
knowing
that
another
"A"
would
go
in
the
book,
but
it
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
I
was
good
at
writing.
People
never
read
my
country
reports
and
said
that
I
was
a
remarkable
writer
for
my
age.
Now,
I
know
that
my
teachers
gave
out
good
grades
on
reports
such
as
the
country
reports
because
they
knew
how
much
time
we
put
into
them.
In
tenth
grade,
my
English
teacher
made
us
write
children's
books
about
an
environmental
issue,
and
this
was
actually
fun.
I
am
still
really
proud
of
the
book
that
my
friend
and
I
created
for
that
class.
The
arrangement
we
made
was
that
I
would
write
the
story
if
she
would
illustrate,
and
our
book,
"Without
the
Flowers,"
ended
up
great.
Our
book
even
has
an
official
copyright.
With
this
assignment
came
the
startling
revelation
that
maybe
some
writing
could
be
fun
and
rewarding
even
if
it
was
assigned.
Although
I
enjoyed
writing
"Without
the
Flowers,"
my
Advanced
Placement
English
class
was
where
my
love
for
writing
really
came
into
the
forefront.
My
teacher
for
this
class,
Miss
Snow,
was
amazing.
She
assigned
the
longest
papers
I
had
ever
seen,
and
she
gave
the
worst
grades
that
I
had
ever
seen.
Miss
Snow
taught
me
the
most
of
anyone
in
my
high
school,
and
her
class
was
the
only
one
that
I
feel
prepared
me
adequately
for
the
challenge
that
college
presents
to
freshmen.
The
other
senior
English
class
busied
themselves
playing
human
games
of
chess
and
doing
satirical
skits
while
we
(all
eight
of
us)
wrote
paper
after
paper,
and
did
research
upon
research.
Despite
all
of
the
hard
work
and
her
strict
grading
policy,
she
was
a
very
fair
teacher.
By
the
end
of
the
year,
we
all
earned
respectable
grades,
and
we
were
much
better
writers
than
when
we
began
the
class.
Miss
Snow
was
also
the
first
teacher
to
tell
me
that
I
was
a
good
writer.
I
had
received
good
grades
in
the
past,
but
no
one
ever
told
me
that
I
was
good
at
what
I
was
doing.
To
hear
that
from
Miss
Snow
was
the
greatest
compliment
I
had
ever
been
given.
I
got
the
highest
grade
in
that
class,
I
had
worked
hard
for
it,
and
I
ended
up
enjoying
it.
Although
all
of
Miss
Snow's
assignments
were
outlined
by
her,
telling
us
exactly
what
we
were
to
prove
through
our
writing,
we
were
given
a
significant
amount
of
freedom
in
expressing
what
we
wanted
to
in
the
papers.
This
helped
me
to
realize
that
writing
of
any
sort
is
an
expression
of
the
author.
It
also
proved
to
me
how
every
person
solves
problems
through
writing
in
a
different
way
from
everyone
else.
Thanks
to
Miss
Snow,
my
First
Year
Seminar
at
Lafayette
was
not
like
a
cold
bucket
of
water
thrown
into
my
face,
but
more
like
a
chilly
one.
Of
course,
college
writing
was
even
more
demanding
than
that
of
my
Senior
English
class,
and
I
was
bound
to
hate
it.
However,
I
did
not
hate
it
at
all.
Much
like
the
entire
concept
of
college
itself,
the
ultimate
amount
of
freedom
was
given
to
me
in
my
FYS.
My
class
was
assigned
a
certain
amount
of
reading
every
time
we
met,
and
at
the
end,
the
professor
would
say
that
we
had
to
write
something
about
the
reading.
We
always
asked
her
exactly
what
she
wanted
us
to
write
about,
but
she
always
told
us
to
write
about
whatever
we
wanted
to.
It
drove
me
crazy
at
first
because
I
wanted
to
write
what
she
wanted
to
read,
but
after
a
few
papers,
I
began
to
get
used
to
the
idea.
Without
a
restriction
on
what
we
could
write
about,
we
were
able
to
actively
take
part
in
our
education
by
exploring
the
ideas
we
found
interesting
or
puzzling.
My
professor
also
had
another
interesting
idea.
We
were
not
given
grades
until
we
received
our
reports
over
Christmas
Break.
She
made
comments
on
all
of
our
papers,
and
assessed
their
quality,
but
no
letter
grades
were
ever
given
out.
She
called
this
The
Real
University,
where
learning
was
the
goal
instead
of
a
letter.
So,
instead
of
learning
to
improve
our
grades,
we
had
to
learn
to
write.
Her
comments
were
always
helpful,
and
they
shaped
what
she
expected
from
us.
What
she
did
not
want
us
to
do
is
reiterate
what
she
had
said
in
class.
She
was
interested
only
in
what
we
learned
or
experienced
through
the
reading
or
discussions.
I
thought
this
class
was
amazing.
I
was
not
stressed
out
to
receive
a
good
grade,
but
I
worked
really
hard
anyway.
Who
would
have
thought
that
students
of
today
could
be
dedicated
without
a
rating
system
to
defeat?
My
dedication
and
excitement
about
FYS
was
illustrated
when
I
was
assigned
a
paper
where
we
had
to
create
a
Chautauqua
modeled
after
the
one
Robert
Pirsig
created
in
his
book,
Zen
and
the
Art
of
Motorcycle
Maintenance.
The
purpose
of
the
Chautauqua
was
to
take
an
intellectual
journey.
Pirsig
related
repairing
and
maintaining
a
motorcycle
to
the
concepts
of
Zen
and
his
insights
on
life.
We
were
told
to
try
and
do
this
same
basic
thing,
except
create
our
own
motorcycle,
and
compare
that
to
high
culture
and
pop
culture.
For
some
reason,
I
wrapped
myself
entirely
up
in
this
paper
for
about
a
week
and
a
half.
I
even
gave
up
going
out
and
socializing
so
that
I
could
write,
rewrite
and
fine
tune
my
Chautauqua
about
tree
climbing
and
culture.
After
I
printed
and
changed
the
ten
page
paper
about
twenty
times,
I
thought
I
finally
had
it.
When
I
put
it
together
and
handed
it
in,
I
felt
a
sense
of
relief
and
great
pride.
The
Chautauqua
was
a
test
on
how
well
we
could
express
our
creative
views,
and
essentially
evaluated
our
use
of
our
new-found
creative
freedom.
I
felt
that
I
had
conquered
the
test
and
utilized
the
freedom
given
to
me
to
the
fullest,
and
what
is
more,
I
loved
doing
it.
My
delusions
of
how
much
freedom
college
students
were
given
in
English
classes
were
corrected
the
next
semester.
The
Real
University
was
replaced
by
a
normal
grading
system,
and
I
thought
that
would
be
the
end
of
my
writing
career.
I
was
sure
that
I
was
not
good
enough
to
keep
up
with
the
upperclassmen
in
my
Literary
Questions
class,
so
the
grades
would
put
a
quick
end
to
my
grade
point
average.
As
it
turned
out,
everything
went
alright.
Surprisingly,
my
goals
remained
the
same
as
they
were
in
FYS,
and
instead
of
working
for
a
good
grade,
I
worked
to
write
well
and
get
suggestions
on
how
to
make
my
writing
better.
I
remembered
the
way
my
FYS
teacher
taught
us
to
write
and
express
ourselves
and
I
tried
to
do
that
the
best
that
I
could.
I
did
not
get
many
outstanding
compliments
in
my
Literary
Questions
class,
but
I
got
decent
marks
and
I
never
gave
up
my
enjoyment
of
writing
and
reading.
After
we
got
a
paper
back
one
day,
the
girl
next
to
me
exclaimed,
"I
have
never
gotten
anything
but
an
A
on
a
paper
in
my
life!"
She
had
only
received
a
B.
She
quickly
filed
the
paper
in
the
back
of
her
folder
and
ran
out
of
class,
and
never
touched
that
paper
again,
I
am
sure.
I
also
received
a
B
on
that
paper,
but
I
read
all
of
the
comments
that
the
teacher
made,
and
made
note
of
them
in
my
mind
so
that
I
did
not
make
the
same
mistakes
twice.
I
probably
did
make
some
of
the
same
mistakes
in
the
next
paper,
but
the
point
is
that
a
single
letter
discouraged
a
person
from
her
writing
and
her
expression
of
herself.
She
might
have
found
the
professor's
comments
interesting
and
helpful,
but
the
grade
written
on
the
top
of
that
paper
stopped
her
from
caring
what
the
professor
thought
was
wrong
with
her
paper.
I
think
a
B
is
a
very
respectable
grade,
but
she
was
obviously
upset
so
much
by
this
letter
that
she
blocked
off
her
entire
learning
opportunity
on
the
spot.
I
do
not
believe
that
the
teacher
meant
that
the
grade
should
be
taken
as
the
final
word
on
all
of
the
papers,
I
think
that
her
comments
within
the
paper
were
meant
to
be
the
most
important
part
of
the
grade.
However,
because
the
system
requires
a
grade
to
be
given,
teachers
and
students
are
trapped
into
thinking
that
all
reactions
to
one's
writing
can
be
summed
up
in
one
letter.
Teachers
know
what
good
writing
is,
and
they
have
found
the
pleasure
in
it
for
themselves,
but
now
it
seems
it
is
difficult
to
pass
that
joy
on
when
they
are
confined
by
such
a
system.
Comparing
my
experiences
in
First
Year
Seminar
with
those
in
Literary
Questions
with
respect
to
different
grading
or
evaluation
situations
has
helped
to
bring
me
to
where
I
am
now.
Although
most
of
my
high
school
career
was
focused
on
getting
good
grades,
I
realize
that
writing
in
my
journal
or
composing
poetry
is
really
what
writing
is
about.
It
is
about
expression
and
trying
to
make
your
reader
interested
in
what
you
are
writing.
So,
as
I
write
in
the
future,
I
have
decided
to
take
the
excitement
I
feel
about
my
poetry
and
apply
it
to
everything
I
compose.
My
First
Year
Seminar
seemed
to
be
more
focused
on
this
excitement
for
writing,
and
Miss
Snow's
class
was
focused
on
that
excitement
as
well
as
the
technical
aspects
of
writing,
and
I
believe
the
combination
of
both
of
these
classes
has
accurately
portrayed
to
me
what
writing
means
to
those
who
do
it
for
a
living.
Back
when
I
was
writing
my
journal
or
beginning
my
Country
reports,
I
never
thought
that
I
would
care
what
"Real"
writers
felt
about
their
jobs.
Throughout
the
years
that
I
have
had
to
write,
my
feelings
toward
the
task
have
changed
drastically.
However,
it
was
not
until
my
senior
year,
or
perhaps
even
the
end
of
my
first
semester
in
college
that
I
realized
how
much
fun
writing
is.
I
am
not
a
grammar
whiz
or
a
perfect
writer
by
any
means,
but
because
I
enjoy
it,
my
friends
continually
ask
me
to
help
them
by
reading
and
making
suggestions
about
their
papers.
Through
reading
other
people's
work,
I
have
discovered
it
helps
me
to
decide
what
I
like
and
dislike
about
my
own
writing.
Although
I
do
not
intend
to
become
a
professional
writer,
I
feel
I
should
develop
my
communication
skills
to
the
highest
level
because
expressing
yourself
appropriately
is
one
of
the
most
important
concepts
in
the
world
today.
If
nothing
else,
my
evolution
as
a
writer
has
taught
me
that,
and
I
now
enjoy
the
challenge
writing
offers.
