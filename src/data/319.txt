WA
writing
assignment
August
17,
2001
As
a
young
child,
one
of
my
favorite
pastimes
was
reading.
Reading
was
a
good
way
for
me
to
stretch
my
imagination
and
improve
my
vocabulary
skills.
When
I
started
elementary
school,
I
was
able
to
borrow
books
from
the
library
allowing
me
to
read
a
variety
of
genres
and
styles.
I
was
fascinated
by
the
way
authors
could
use
words
to
create
such
a
realistic
image
in
my
mind.
Because
of
these
experiences,
I
often
dreamed
of
becoming
a
writer
myself.
This
dream
of
becoming
a
writer
helped
me
focus
on
improving
my
writing
skills
throughout
my
life.
From
the
earliest
assignments
in
grade
school
to
the
research
papers
in
college,
I
tried
hard
to
present
well-written
papers
and
to
absorb
as
much
feedback
from
teachers
and
peers
as
possible.
I
continued
to
read,
exposing
myself
to
different
styles
and
expanding
my
vocabulary.
I
wrote
in
many
different
styles
with
different
audiences.
My
English
teachers
provided
me
with
the
knowledge
for
the
proper
use
of
grammar.
My
life
has
provided
me
with
experiences
for
subject
matter.
Technology
has
provided
me
with
different
means
of
organizing
my
thoughts.
Through
these
mediums,
I
have
worked
hard
to
achieve
this
dream
of
becoming
an
author
from
child
to
teen
and
adolescent
to
adult.
My
earliest
memories
of
writing
are
of
my
experiences
in
the
gifted
program,
known
as
G.A.T.E.
in
my
school
district.
As
a
young
child-
a
second
or
third
grader-1
was
required
to
do
an
independent
study.
I
was
allotted
a
time
each
week
where
the
gifted
students
in
my
grade
and
I
met
for
different
mind
expanding
activities.
During
this
time,
we
could
also
research
the
topic
for
our
independent
study.
The
format
of
this
independent
study
consisted
of
a
written
packet
and
two
visual
aids.
The
packet
was
not
in
a
formal
writing
style;
however,
it
was
a
good
tool
for
organizing
thoughts
into
different
"chapters."
It
helped
me
learn
to
take
the
information
I
read
and
reorganize
it
into
my
own
words.
It
also
helped
me
decide
which
headings
were
most
important
to
my
topic.
My
teacher
read
over
our
rough
drafts
and
proofread
them,
providing
us
with
valuable
feedback.
These
projects,
which
continued
until
junior
high,
helped
my
practice
and
improve
my
skills
in
the
writing
process.
In
addition
to
my
experiences
in
G.A.T.E.,
Gifted
and
Talented
Enrichment,
I
learned
about
the
writing
process
and
other
elements
of
writing
throughout
grade
school.
In
second
grade,
my
teacher,
Ms.
Rogers,
had
us
compile
a
collection
of
poems.
Each
student
found
their
favorite
poem
and
copied
it
down
for
the
anthology.
Throughout
the
process,
we
learned
about
the
conventions
of
poetry.
Poetry
gradually
became
an
interest
of
mine
because
of
this
experience.
I
found
it
beautiful
and
intriguing.
I
began
to
write
poetry
of
my
own
in
my
spare
time
at
home
or
at
school.
In
fourth
grade,
I
was
exposed
to
book
reports.
My
teacher
was
particular
in
the
documentation
and
presentation
of
the
books.
I
was
required
to
write
a
summary
of
the
book
and
to
make
a
visual
aid
for
presentation
purposes.
I
learned
to
write
good,
concise
summaries
because
the
teacher
encouraged
us
to
do
it
in
a
particular
style.
During
this
year,
I
was
also
exposed
to
the
writing
process
more.
Any
paper
written
had
to
follow
the
writing
process.
My
teacher
expected
us
students
to
brainstorm,
outline,
write
a
first
draft,
proofread,
and
write
a
final
draft.
My
teacher
usually
proofread
the
papers,
but
she
explained
why
things
should
be
corrected,
which
helped
us
learn
proper
grammar
and
writing
techniques.
Also,
I
was
introduced
to
different
writing
purposes
in
elementary
school.
The
main
purposes
we
covered
were
descriptive,
narrative,
and
explanatory.
Each
year
I
was
required
to
do
one
assignment
in
each
category.
While
learning
about
these
forms,
I
learned
other
important
writing
elements.
I
learned
about
verb
tense,
transition
words,
comma
usage
and
others.
I
also
had
a
chance
to
write
creative
narratives.
This
was
when
I
started
aspiring
to
become
an
author
professionally.
I
enjoyed
trying
to
create
stories
as
interesting
as
the
authors
of
the
books
I
was
reading.
My
teachers
told
me
that
my
writing
skills
were
above
average;
therefore,
they
helped
encourage
me
to
attempt
to
achieve
my
goal.
Junior
high
presented
different
aspects
of
the
English
language
and
writing
than
elementary
school.
Vocabulary
became
more
important.
I
had
a
weekly
list
of
vocabulary
words
that
would
be
tested
at
the
end
of
the
week.
I
was
tested
on
spelling,
definition,
sentence
usage,
and
synonyms
and
antonyms.
The
vocabulary
lessons
continued
through
my
junior
year
of
high
school.
There
was
also
a
focus
on
expository
writing.
I
learned
to
write
with
a
better
focus
and
in
a
scholarly
style.
At
this
time,
I
began
to
use
peer
editing
in
addition
to
the
teacher's
edits.
I
learned
how
to
give
and
accept
constructive
criticism.
Because
I
was
exposed
to
the
writings
of
others
my
age,
it
improved
my
skills
as
a
writer
by
showing
me
how
my
writing
was
perceived
through
another's
eyes.
It
also
taught
me
what
common
mistakes
to
look
for
in
my
own
writing.
These
skills
helped
prepare
me
to
be
a
writer
in
high
school
and
in
college.
In
my
history
classes
throughout
junior
high,
I
began
to
write
small
research
papers.
The
papers
were
not
in
a
particular
documentation
format.
I
was
only
required
to
include
a
bibliography;
however,
I
practiced
gathering
information,
organizing
a
paper,
and
recording
resources.
This
experience
showed
me
how
to
utilize
my
resources
and
how
to
use
a
library
efficiently.
Unfortunately
at
this
time,
I
began
to
put
down
my
casual
reading
books.
I
found
myself
with
less
free
time
and
less
interest
in
reading
for
leisure.
I
lost
my
interest
in
writing
in
the
future.
I
was
more
focused
on
scholastics
and
athletics.
Because
my
workload
increased
academically,
I
thought
that
reading
was
boring
and
that
I
needed
to
use
my
time
to
relax
my
brain.
I
was
also
in
a
stage
where
children's
books
were
not
challenging
enough
anymore,
but
I
was
not
exposed
to
classic
literature
or
a
more
mature
reading
selection.
Then,
when
I
started
high
school,
I
was
required
to
read
novels
for
class.
The
books
assigned
were
not
the
most
exciting
books
I
had
ever
read;
however,
they
were
considered
to
be
some
great
pieces
of
literature.
Now
that
I
had
assigned
reading,
reading
for
pleasure
was
almost
out
of
the
question;
although,
the
discussions
I
had
in
class
about
the
works
helped
me
to
view
and
analyze
the
stories
in
a
different
way.
In
addition,
it
showed
me
a
new
world
of
reading
I
had
never
known.
When
I
reached
eleventh
grade,
my
view
as
a
writer
and
as
a
student
changed
forever.
Mr.
Nellas,
who
was
my
English
teacher,
was
new
to
the
school
district.
He
told
us
about
himself
and
what
he
had
done
since
college,
which
included
writing
a
novel.
This
information
immediately
caught
my
attention.
Mr.
Nellas
pushed
my
classmates
and
I
to
work
hard.
He
wanted
us
to
be
well
prepared
for
college.
He
continuously
related
stories
of
his
college
experiences
preparing
us
for
the
social
and
academic
nature
of
a
secondary
institution.
All
of
our
work,
including
tests,
was
on
a
level
that
none
of
us
had
ever
experienced
with
any
of
our
other
teachers.
This
attitude
toward
the
classroom
was
what
made
Mr.
Nellas
my
favorite
teacher
and
one
of
my
mentors.
After
each
literary
assignment,
we
wrote
papers
related
to
the
novel.
Each
assignment
was
roughly
five
pages
and
was
a
creative
extension
of
the
story.
Mr.
Nellas
pushed
us
to
do
our
best
work;
he
would
settle
for
nothing
less.
He
did
not
believe
in
perfect
papers.
Therefore,
if
anyone
had
an
exceptionally
well-written
paper,
he
would
review
it
with
great
care
to
find
the
smallest
errors.
My
writing
had
to
excel
so
that
I
could
receive
good
grades.
During
this
year,
I
was
assigned
my
first
research
assignment.
Our
paper
was
to
be
on
an
American
author
and
one
of
their
works.
Mr.
Nellas
taught
us
how
to
use
MLA
format,
how
to
write
a
good
bibliography,
and
how
to
research
our
topic.
Because
of
the
limited
resources
in
the
school
library,
I
was
forced
to
go
to
the
community
library
to
find
information
on
literary
criticisms.
Mr.
Nellas
helped
direct
me
and
the
other
students
to
the
kinds
of
books
needed
to
fulfill
the
assignment.
Throughout
the
entire
process,
he
was
there
to
proofread,
suggest,
and
encourage.
To
me,
this
assignment
was
the
first
real
steps
I
would
take
toward
being
a
collegiate
level
writer.
Throughout
the
year,
Mr.
Nellas
taught
me
how
to
prepare
for
college.
He
helped
me
develop
my
skills
as
a
writer
in
order
for
me
to
continue
my
academic
excellence.
My
senior
year,
I
had
a
writing
independent
study
with
Mr.
Nellas.
He
proofread
my
application
and
scholarship
essays.
Because
of
his
experiences
in
college
and
his
profession
as
an
English
teacher,
he
helped
me
improve
the
focus
of
my
writing;
he
showed
me
how
to
avoid
overstatement;
and
he
helped
me
present
myself
well
to
the
reviewers
of
the
applications.
Also
that
year,
he
finished
writing
a
play
of
his
own.
He
asked
me
to
proofread
it
for
him
because
he
was
confident
in
my
skills.
Through
what
he
taught
me,
I
was
able
to
objectively
review
his
writing.
Mr.
Nellas
was
an
inspiration
to
me
in
my
personal
writing
experiences.
I
decided
to
go
back
to
reading
and
writing
on
my
own.
I
started
to
write,
and
am
currently
still
writing,
a
novella
of
my
own.
Because
of
his
teaching
and
from
reading
his
works,
I
felt
that
I
was
well
equipped
to
write
something
of
a
larger
scale.
Writing
became
something
I
used
as
a
release
from
the
stress
I
was
feeling.
Mr.
Nellas
and
I
also
have
plans
to
possibly
collaborate
on
his
second
novel.
After
my
experiences
in
writing
during
high
school,
I
felt
I
was
prepared
to
be
a
college
student.
When
I
got
to
college,
however,
I
found
there
were
still
some
things
I
had
to
learn.
On
the
whole,
I
felt
that
my
writing
was
of
a
higher
standard
than
when
I
was
a
freshman
in
high
school.
I
was
proficient
at
expressing
myself
with
better
elocution.
I
found
that
some
of
my
stylistic
perspectives
were
not
quite
high
enough.
I
have
always
presented
my
papers
with
a
broad
base.
I
thought
that
lots
of
supporting
information
helped
make
a
good
paper.
I
found
out
in
college
that
that
is
not
always
true.
An
abundance
of
supporting
facts
is
good;
however,
the
facts
must
cover
a
narrow
subject
matter.
Writing
on
a
collegiate
level
is
extremely
focused
compared
to
secondary
school.
Through
my
First
Year
Seminar
class,
I
learned
to
improve
that
aspect
of
my
writing.
It
still
is
not
where
it
should
be,
but
I
will
continue
to
learn
throughout
my
life.
I
also
found
that
there
is
more
peer
editing
in
college,
which
opens
one
up
to
more
criticism
on
a
higher
level.
In
College
Writing,
I
had
a
chance
to
work
with
my
fellow
classmates,
in
addition
to
my
professor,
to
improve
my
writing
skills
as
well
as
others.
Now
that
I
am
going
to
be
a
Writing
Associate
I
hope
to
continue
learning
about
writing
and
the
writing
process
in
college.
For
sixteen
years,
I
have
been
preparing
and
developing
myself
as
a
writer,
from
reading
as
a
youngster
to
writing
research
papers
in
college.
I
have
learned
many
things
along
the
way.
I
have
written
many
kinds
of
papers
and
read
many
kinds
of
books.
I
expect
that
I
will
never
stop
learning.
I
hope
that
some
day
I
will
have
something
of
my
own
published,
whether
scholarly
or
not.
Either
way,
I
will
continue
to
try
my
hardest
to
become
the
best
writer
I
can
be.
