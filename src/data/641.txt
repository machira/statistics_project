WA
Assignment
August
21,
2009
As
I
have
started
to
focus
my
studies
in
the
Anthropology
and
Sociology
department
during
my
sophomore
and
junior
years
at
Lafayette,
I
developed
and
became
comfortable
with
a
standard
writing
process
and
style.
Writing
socialogical
pieces
was
within
my
comfort
zone
and
the
more
and
more
I
practiced
this
familiar
form
of
writing,
the
more
and
more
I
excelled.
This
past
year,
however,
I
took
classes
that
have
broadened
my
writing
experiences
in
a
way
that
has
both
challenged,
enhanced,
and
expanded
my
writing
process
and
style.
Though
some
of
these
writing
experiences
were
difficult
at
times,
working
through
different
sets
of
expectations
for
various
writing
disciplines
has
been
a
rewarding
learning
experience
that
has
expanded
my
writing
repertoire.
Fall
semester
of
junior
year
I
took
a
Qualitiative
Methods
class
for
my
Anthropology
and
Sociology
major
that
consisted
of
a
semester-long
group
project
resulting
in
a
collaborative
paper.
This
was
the
first
time
I
had
to
write
a
paper
with
two
other
people,
and
in
doing
so,
I
learned
how
difficult
it
can
be
to
incorporate
three
voices,
opinions,
writing
organization
and
skills
in
one
narrative.
Looking
back
on
this
experience,
I
feel
that
a
group
paper
helped
me
view
each
step
of
the
writing
process
in
a
more
detailed
way.
For
example,
I
couldnOt
just
decide
on
a
topic
for
the
paper
myself;
as
a
group
we
needed
to
discuss
and
collaborate
our
ideas
to
develop
a
strong
topic
that
everyone
would
be
interested
in
writing
about.
After
deciding
to
write
the
paper
on
the
Easton
FarmerOs
Market,
I
found
that
brainstorming
with
the
other
people
in
my
group
was
more
of
a
conversation
than
an
individual
paper
and
pen
idea
session.
During
these
conversations,
listening
and
responding
to
othersO
ideas
seemed
to
be
the
most
important
writing
skills.
I
had
to
listen
to
the
others
in
my
group
so
my
ideas
and
eventual
part
of
the
paper
were
consistent
with
the
rest
of
the
group.
While
brainstorming,
I
was
definitely
frustrated
that
some
of
my
ideas
were
not
as
well
received
by
the
other
members
of
my
group,
but
I
learned
that
collaborative
group
papers
require
a
little
bit
of
give
and
take
for
all
members
of
the
group
to
be
happy
with
the
topic
and
final
paper.
I
think
the
most
helpful
component
of
the
brainstorming
and
conversation
process
was
the
immediate
feedback
I
received
from
the
other
people
in
my
group.
Whenever
I
wanted
an
opinion
on
my
ideas,
I
had
two
people
readily
willing
and
interested
in
developing
my
thoughts.
The
basis
of
conversation
in
the
brainstorming
and
preliminary
writing
process
often
reminded
me
of
the
conversation
I
try
to
start
with
other
students
during
WA
conferences.
I
found
that
a
lot
of
students
get
so
caught
up
in
actually
writing
that
they
forget
writing
is
actually
just
a
written
form
of
a
conversation.
Thus,
to
overcome
initial
writerOs
block,
I
encourage
students
to
talk
about
what
they
want
to
include
in
their
paper
as
I
take
notes
on
their
ideas
they
can
use
while
writing.
Writing
my
component
of
the
group
paper
was
probably
the
easiest
part
of
the
group
writing
process,
which
is
ironically
the
part
that
takes
me
the
longest
when
IOm
writing
an
independent
paper.
Each
member
of
the
group
worked
on
their
own
section
of
the
paper,
of
course
incorporating
other
peopleOs
ideas
in
their
written
section
as
well.
During
this
stage,
I
found
that
I
needed
to
trust
that
each
personOs
section
would
be
complete
by
the
date
we
all
agreed
on
and
that
other
people
will
include
what
they
need
to
in
their
part.
In
group
projects,
I
tend
to
worry
about
whether
other
members
in
the
group
are
fulfilling
their
duties,
but
each
of
us
had
such
a
large
amount
of
writing
to
complete
that
time
only
allowed
me
to
be
concerned
with
my
part
and
trust
in
the
others
in
my
group.
During
the
writing
period,
I
found
comfort
in
abiding
by
a
timetable
and
chart
of
responsibilities
our
group
routinely
covered
and
reiterated
at
weekly
meetings.
When
writing
papers
independently,
I
usually
donOt
set
aside
enough
time
to
re-read
and
edit
my
paper
even
though
I
know
I
should.
For
this
paper,
however,
we
had
to
edit
our
paper
to
ensure
our
parts
of
the
paper
flowed
together
in
a
coherent
fashion.
By
dedicating
a
sufficient
time
to
edit,
we
did
our
best
to
overcame
obstacles
that
would
naturally
arise
with
three
different
writing
styles;
for
example,
we
focused
on
collectively
writing
transition
sentences
and
paragraphs
to
ease
the
flow
into
a
new
section
of
the
paper.
Everyone
in
the
group
also
read
over
the
entire
rough
draft
and
made
suggestions
to
improve
certain
elements
of
another
memberOs
writing
like
integrating
various
sentence
structures,
correcting
grammar
mistakes,
or
improving
vocabulary.
Our
discussion
of
suggestions
was
similar
to
a
WA
conference
in
that
we
pointed
out
strong
elements
of
each
personOs
work
as
well
as
points
in
the
paper
we
thought
could
be
stronger.
Because
part
of
our
grade
was
dependent
on
the
whole
paper,
everyone
knew
we
had
to
be
honest
with
one
another
about
improvements,
but
as
a
group
that
had
to
work
together,
everyone
also
knew
that
we
had
to
share
constructive
criticism
rather
than
unjustified
opinions.
Even
though
writing
a
group
paper
was
probably
one
of
the
hardest
writing
assignments
I
have
done
because
it
took
so
much
planning,
trust,
and
communication,
I
definitely
learned
how
to
write
effectively
with
other
people
and
benefit
from
exchanging
ideas
and
receiving
feedback
from
others.
As
I
had
with
the
group
paper
a
semester
prior,
this
past
spring
semester
I
studied
abroad
in
Croatia
and
had
an
equally
different
experience
with
an
independent
study
project
I
conducted.
My
research
and
paper
looked
at
how
a
feminist
organization
in
Croatia
informs
the
public
of
their
feminist
initiatives
through
public
outreach
in
the
form
of
media,
performances,
or
brochures.
The
first
difference
I
experienced
with
this
paper
was
that
I
had
to
gather
information
from
interviews
and
participant
observation
notes.
In
the
past,
I
conducted
a
majority
of
my
research
for
writing
assignments
within
the
confines
of
a
library,
gathering
most
information
from
the
internet
or
books.
This
time,
however,
I
used
primary
sources
as
my
main
support
in
my
paper
with
texts
and
internet
research
to
support
my
findings.
I
found
that
this
form
of
research
was
a
lot
more
time
consuming
because
it
involved
contacting,
meeting
with,
and
following
up
with
other
people
who
also
have
very
busy
schedules.
I
also
had
to
be
more
flexible
with
my
time
because
I
often
scheduled
interviews
with
people
who
cancelled,
forgot,
or
remembered
two
hours
later
than
we
originally
scheduled.
Nonetheless,
I
knew
I
had
to
be
coincidingly
persistent
and
polite
with
people
I
wanted
to
speak
with
because
I
needed
certain
perspectives
and
input
from
interviewees
to
give
a
complete
argument
in
my
paper.
Looking
back,
I
think
I
prefered
research
in
the
form
of
interviews
over
researching
at
the
library
because
I
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
many
personalities
and,
if
the
interview
went
well,
I
found
that
I
could
gather
a
lot
of
valuable
information
in
just
an
hour.
The
greatest
limitation
I
found
in
interviewing
women
in
Croatia
was
a
language
barrier.
One
of
my
interviewees
mentioned
to
me
at
the
conclusion
of
an
interview,
NI
have
a
complex
because
you
are
from
the
United
States
because
of
your
English,
not
because
you
are
from
the
United
States.O
The
language
barrier
limited
some
of
my
interviewees,
which
may
have
limited
the
details
interviewees
could
relay
to
me.
Additionally,
my
inability
to
carry
out
an
interview
in
Croatian
limited
me
in
who
I
could
interview.
There
were
a
few
knowledgeable
women
I
could
not
interview
because
I
did
not
speak
Croatian.
I
encountered
another
obstacle
with
conveying
background
information
on
feminism
in
Croatia
before
going
into
my
research.
While
I
knew
providing
background
information
was
essential
to
framing
my
research,
I
overestimated
how
much
my
audience
might
know
about
the
topic.
I
had
to
make
sure
I
explained
every
detail
I
knew
from
my
personal
background
research
in
my
paper
so
that
my
readers
knew
why
my
research
was
important
and
what
research
I
was
presenting
to
them.
Keeping
the
audience
in
mind
is
something
I
have
always
struggled
with
because
I
can
get
so
caught
up
in
more
developed
ideas
that
I
forget
to
write
for
a
reader
who
is
reading
about
my
topic
for
the
first
time.
In
both
major
writing
experiences
I
had
over
the
past
year,
I
think
I
have
developed
in
a
way
that
broadened
my
writing
identity.
Writing
a
group
paper
and
interviewing
people
from
a
different
country
with
a
different
native
tongue
both
contributed
to
my
research
and
writing
skills.
I
know
that
my
broadened
expereinces
and
set
of
skills
will
help
me
approach
my
position
as
a
WA
with
much
more
confidence
in
helping
other
students
with
unique
or
unfamiliar
assignments.
Whenever
I
felt
completely
lost
in
writing
over
the
past
year,
I
always
referred
to
a
brainstorming,
outlining,
writing,
and
editing
process
that
structured
my
new
experiences
in
a
way
I
could
easily
understand.
It
is
this
structure
that
I
hope
to
pass
on
to
other
WAOs
and
students
I
hold
conferences
with
so
that
they
may
have
some
sort
of
standard
guidance
when
confronted
with
an
unfamiliar
assignment.
Working
as
a
WA
has
played
an
equally
important
role
as
my
experiences
in
developing
my
writing
skills
in
the
past
year.
For
example,
I
found
that
conferencing
and
talking
about
a
topic
before
starting
to
write
a
paper
proved
to
be
a
successful
brainstorming
technique
to
get
ideas
flowing.
I
have
often
used
conversation
with
family
members
or
friends
to
develop
my
ideas
before
outlining
a
writing
assignment.
Like
WA
conferences
provide,
the
conversations
I
have
provide
feedback
on
my
ideas
and
suggestions
on
ways
to
further
my
thoughts.
Working
as
a
WA
has
also
played
a
role
in
how
much
time
I
dedicate
to
editing
my
writing
assignments.
As
I
mentioned
earlier,
I
have
always
been
someone
who
writes
a
paper
and
hands
it
in
without
dedicating
time
to
editing.
So
I
found
myself
in
a
contradictory
position
where
I
was
encouraging
students
to
finish
their
papers
a
few
days
earlier
I
would
have
time
to
read
the
papers
and
they
would
have
time
to
edit,
but
I
was
not
doing
the
same.
Even
though
I
tend
to
work
best
under
pressure
and
end
up
not
having
enough
time
to
edit,
fulfilling
my
position
as
a
WA
has
helped
me
understand
how
much
editing
can
help
clarify
and
organize
an
argument
as
well
as
correct
little
mistakes
like
grammar,
spelling,
and
word
choice.
Now
that
I
make
a
conscious
effort
to
read
my
paper
over
at
least
once
and
even
ask
friends
to
do
the
same,
I
feel
that
little
corrections
I
make
to
my
transition
sentences,
thesis,
or
conclusion
strengthen
my
paper
as
a
whole.
As
a
WA
for
the
first
time
last
fall
semester,
the
orientation
before
classes
helped
me
put
my
job
into
perspective.
I
though
the
veteran
WAs
offered
a
lot
of
useful
suggestions
as
to
what
to
expect
from
professors
and
students
and
what
conferences
should
accomplish.
Further
advice
from
other
WAs
at
weekly
staff
meetings
put
my
worries
at
ease
as
well.
For
example,
my
professor
only
wanted
his
students
to
meet
with
me
for
one
paper
even
though
WAs
are
technically
required
to
meet
with
each
student
four
times
throughout
the
entire
semester.
I
brought
this
up
at
one
of
the
first
staff
meetings,
and
some
veteran
WAs
suggested
meeting
with
students
for
an
Nintroduce
yourselfO
conference
or
a
brainstorming
conference
in
addition
to
an
editing
conference
a
week
or
a
few
days
before
the
assignment
is
due.
Additionally,
I
learned
from
veteran
WAs
to
be
flexible
with
time
and
persistent
in
meeting
with
students
who
may
make
every
excuse
in
the
world
not
to
sit
down
for
a
conference.
When
I
fist
saw
my
student
writers
in
a
conference
setting,
I
focused
on
introducing
myself
as
a
fellow
student
so
I
presented
myself
as
someone
who
is
easily
approachable
and
comfortable
to
talk
with.
To
further
a
WA-student
relationship,
I
also
asked
the
first-year
student
writers
how
they
liked
Lafayette
so
far,
what
they
were
planning
to
major
in,
what
dorm
they
were
living
in,
and
other
general
questions.
I
additionally
used
this
first
conference
to
introduce
what
the
College
Writing
Program
offered
as
far
as
drop-in
hours
and
one-on-one
conferences
with
writing
associates
like
myself.
Furthermore,
I
pointed
out
what
I
expected
to
accomplish
during
conferences
and
what
my
student
writers
needed
to
do
to
be
prepared
for
conferences.
I
would
suggest
that
all
new
WAs
take
a
little
bit
of
time
at
the
beginning
of
their
first
conference
to
interact
with
the
student
writer
on
a
personal
basis
to
develop
a
relationship
that
will
make
the
writer
feel
more
comfortable
about
asking
questions
and
open
to
feedback.
I
think
itOs
also
important
for
new
WAs
to
understand
that
not
everyone
at
Lafayette
is
a
strong
writer.
I
remember
being
shocked
the
first
time
I
read
through
some
papers,
so
much
so
that
I
thought
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
turn
this
student
into
a
strong
writer.
ThatOs
where
I
learned
that
as
a
WA
I
couldnOt
change
every
student
writer
into
an
excellent
writer;
instead,
I
should
focus
on
improving
elements
of
a
personOs
writing
like
their
paper
organization,
thesis
construction,
or
transisition
sentences
between
paragraphs.
I
think
that
new
WAs
should
know
that
every
little
improvement
in
their
student
writerOs
paper
is
a
success
no
matter
what
the
improvement
is.
I
am
very
excited
to
begin
the
academic
year
as
a
veteran
WA.
Although
I
have
only
worked
as
a
WA
for
one
semester
due
to
studying
abroad,
I
feel
more
comfortable
with
my
responsibilities
and
expectations
for
the
upcoming
year.
Reflecting
on
my
writing
experiences
and
work
as
a
WA
has
helped
me
understand
where
I
stand
as
a
writer
and
how
I
can
further
help
student
writers
to
expand
their
thoughts
and
improve
their
writing.
