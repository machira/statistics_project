R
On
September
9,
1991,
I
embarked
on
a
literary
journey.
Although
I
didnyut
know
it
at
the
time,
I
was
molding
myself
into
the
writer
that
I
am
today
and
that
which
I
will
become
in
the
future.
1991
was
the
year
I
established
the
creative
and
grammatical
foundation
upon
which
I
have
built
an
understanding
of
the
written
language.
The
ninth
of
September
was
my
first
week
in
first
grade
at
Gilead
Hill
School,
the
first
journal
entry
of
my
life,
and
the
first
writing
obstacle
that
I
had
to
overcome.
I
had
to
learn
to
put
my
thoughts
on
paper.
Scrawled
unevenly
in
pencil
across
stained
and
faded,
gray
recycle
paper
that
is
stapled
into
a
manila
folder,
are
my
six-year-old
thoughts:

By
the
end
of
first
grade,
I
was
writing
like
a
pro:
On
Sunday,
my
uncles
and
my
grandma
came
to
my
house.
They
stayed
for
lunch
and
supper.
Me
and
my
uncles

ducks

On

me
and
my

to

On

I
went

marched
in
the
Memorial

parade.
It
was
a
long
parade.

my
cousinyus

Thursday,
Mary
B.
came
to
my
house
and
we
got
my
sisters
towul
all
derttey!
In
first
grade,
I
learned
three
important
lessons
about
writing.
One,
always
write
in
pencil
so
that
it
is
possible
to
erase
(of
which
I
did
a
lot
in
first
grade).
Two,
even
if
you
donyut
know
the
word,
do
the
best
that
you
can
(you
can
always
erase
a
mistake
or
fill
in
the
blanks).
And
three,
keep
writing
(ityus
the
best,
and
only,
practice).
R
A
House
is
a
House
for
Me
To:
All
my
best

and

A
school
is
a
house
for
learning
A
brain
is
a
house
for
thinking
A
book
is
a
house
for
stories
And
a
house
is
a
house
for
me.
An
ear
is
a
house
for
hearing
A
tongue
is
a
house
for

An
eye
is
a
house
for
seeing
And
a

is
a
house
for

is
a
house

On
June
7,
1993,
I
was
on
the
verge
of
two
major
events.
I
was
about
to
finish
second
grade,
and
my
massive
collection
of
stories
was
nearly
complete.
Lisayus
Second
Grade
Stories
is
a
compilation
of
my
written
work
from
second
grade
that
is
typed,
illustrated,
and
neatly
spiral
bound.
Its
pages
are
houses
for
many
stories,
both
written
and
untold.
I
can
remember
the
latter
now,
as
I
nostalgically
look
through
the
sticky
pages.
It
took
me
three
days
to
write
the
eight-sentence
story,
meCorduroy
at
the
Zoo,mo
another
two
weeks
to
edit,
and
a
classmateyus
generous
mother,
five
minutes
to
type.
If
I
can
correctly
recall,
the
winter
of
1992-1993
was
also
the
first
time
I
got
my
hands
on
my
dadyus
old
typewriter
and
would
sit
next
to
my
fireplace
for
hours
on
end
just
typing
the
thoughts
that
fluttered
through
my
head.
Tap,
tap,
tap,
and
instantly
my
thoughts
came
alive.
In
second
grade,
I
learned
two
more
lessons
about
writing.
One,
edit,
edit,
edit
until
the
ideas
are
ready
for
publication.
And
two,
let
creativity
run
free.
R
In
third
grade,
I
continued
to
write
while
learning
how
to
type
on
a
computer
and
print
my
thoughts
in
black
and
white.
My
greatest
accomplishment
that
year
was
teaching
myself
how
to
use
Microsoft
DOS
on
the
ancient
computer
we
had.
A:\go
would
send
me
to
a
white
screen
with
a
black,
blinking
I-bar,
prompting
me
to
hunt-and-peck
for
each
letter.
Although
it
took
an
eight-year-oldyus
forever,
I
could
easily
delete
mistakes
and
rearrange
my
sentences.
In
third
grade,
I
learned
that
diligence
and
patience
pay
off
when
you
finally
hit
print.
R
In
fourth
grade,
I
learned
how
to
research
various
topics
and
follow
rubrics.
Neatly
typed,
illustrated,
and
bound
in
a
white
report
folio
is,
Native
American
People:
The
Algonquians
noThe
Algonquian
people
were
polite
and
generous.
They
shared
everything
around
their
villages.
They
worked
together
building
canoes,
preparing
tools
and
weapons,
planting
vegetables
and
building
homesno
While
the
men
were
out
hunting
and
fishing,
the
women
and
children
would
collect
lobsters,
crabs,
and
shellfish
along
the
shore.
After
the
men
set
animal
traps,
the
women
and
children
checked
them
daily.
They
also
worked
in
the
fields
planting
crops.
It
was
the
childrenyus
responsibility
to
chase
the
birds
away
from
the
cropsno
1994-1995
was
the
school
year
in
which
I
learned
how
to
use
a
card
catalog
in
the
library
to
locate
books
about
specific
topics
and
cite
sources
in
a
reference
page.
I
also
learned
how
to
manage
long-term
projects
and
that
hard
work
provides
tremendous
gratification
in
the
end.
R
Fifth
and
sixth
grades
passed
as
I
continued
on
my
expressive
written
journey.
Those
years
found
me
writing
adventure
stories
and
invention
proposals
for
my
Challenge
&
Enrichment
class.
Book
reports,
research
projects,
and
creative
stores
found
a
way
into
my
repertoire
through
dutiful
editing
and
precise,
cursive
penmanship.
I
became
an
expert
at
following
assignments
and
completing
them
thoroughly.
Middle
school
brought
with
it
a
new
challenge.
The
Open
Assignment.
My
first
assignment
as
a
seventh
grader:
write
a
creative
story.
That
was
it.
No
rules,
no
rubric,
no
limits,
no
suggestions.
Between
1997
and
1999,
I
learned
to
take
a
blank
piece
of
paper
and
make
it
mine
by
decorating
it
with
my
own
unique
thoughts.
I
learned
how
to
explore
the
same
story
from
several
points
of
view,
I
learned
how
to
fill
a
red,
paper
leaf
with
an
autumn
poem,
and
I
learned
how
to
illustrate
a
12-page
fable
using
only
construction
paper
and
glue.
And
I
prepared
for
writing
in
high
school.
R
Prior
to
autumn,
1999,
I
never
really
explored
the
depths
of
my
writing
capabilities.
Everything
I
authored
was
one
of
two
things:
prompted
by
a
strict
assignment,
or
restricted
by
my
naFu
e
belief
that
all
stories
should
have
nothing
less
than
the
most
optimistic
tone.
Both
my
freshman
year
English
and
Spanish
teachers
promoted
creative,
open-minded
thinking,
helping
me
to
realize
that
not
all
things
in
life
are
necessarily
uplifting.
I
was
so
inspired
by
Latin-American
literature
that
I
wrote
a
bi-lingual
poem.
In
ninth
grade
Spanish,
I
learned
how
to
express
the
emotion
in
my
heart
with
a
different,
beautifully
poetic
language.
English
class
that
year
proved
to
be
the
most
eventful
and
influential
writing
experience
thus
far.
My
teacher
published
several
of
my
pieces
in
the
school
literary
magazine.
One
piece
was
a
creative
story
that
filled
six
full,
two-column
pages
in
the
48-page
publication,
several
others
were
short
poems,
and
one
was
a
childhood
memory
of
my
beloved
grandfather.
Earlier
in
the
year,
I
had
been
nominated
to
attend
the
first
annual
Connecticut
Writing
Conference
at
the
University
of
Connecticut.
Although
the
program
was
only
designed
for
juniors
and
seniors,
they
made
an
exception
for
me
at
my
teacheryus
request.
I
attended
several
workshops
throughout
the
day,
most
of
which
offered
different
approaches
to
creative
writing.
I
vividly
remember
sitting
around
a
discussion
table
with
my
UConn
legal
pad
in
hand,
furiously
scribbling
down
thoughts
about
a
bittersweet
memory.
The
assignment:
write
about
the
earliest
emotional
moment
you
can
remember.
Grandpayus
Little
Angel
For
Grandpa
Wallace,
d.
M
ay
30,
1991
I
am
my
grandpayus
little
angel,
Or
so
he
proclaims
right
now
As
I
sit
on
his
lap
at
the
table.
He
compliments
me
on
my
pretty,
dark
hair
And
on
my
favorite
dress,
that
I
wore
today
especially
for
him.
He
compliments
me
like
the
charming,
young
soldier
That
still
thrives
within
him,
And
he
always
makes
me
feel
like
a
princess.
He
shows
me,
with
a
grin,
That
Grandpa
the
Great
and
Wonderful
Can
pull
a
nickel
from
my
ear,
As
I
lean
over
to
unlock
the
brakes
to
his
wheelchair.
I
always
wondered
why
there
were
brakes
on
a
wheelchair
mi
Where
would
it
roll
while
Grandpa
was
sitting
in
it?
He
notices
and
calls
me
a
little
rascal,
And
he
tickles
me
so
hard
that
I
canyut
squirm
Because
I
am
drowning
in
laughter.
Grandpa
lets
me
have
a
sip
of
his
coffee
From
his
faded
white
mug
Covered
in
blue
bunny
rabbits,
Something
I
can
only
get
away
with
once
I
escape
My
parentsyu
watchful
eyes.
Something
I
can
only
do
With
Grandpa.
He
tells
me
that
when
I
dance
The
whole
world
smiles
As
I
twirl
in
my
pretty
pink
dress.
Grandpa
takes
a
puff
of
his
cigarette
And
the
smoke
fades
upward
Past
his
full
head
of
white
hair
To
join
the
gray
patch
on
the
ceiling.
I
ask
Grandpa
if
I
can
see
his
stubs.
He
laughs
his
hearty
laugh
As
he
yanks
up
his
crisp
brown
pants
To
reveal
his
amputated
legs.
They
truly
are
stubs,
cut
just
above
the
knees.
I
trace
the
fourteen
stitches
on
his
right
leg
With
a
shaky
finger
He
says
his
stubs
would
make
the
perfect
footballs
With
symmetrical
stitches
right
down
the
middle.
Grandpa
takes
a
sip
of
coffee
Then
places
his
blue,
bunny-covered
mug
down
on
the
table
Right
next
to
his
small,
brown
bottle
of
insulin.
And
he
sets
his
cigarette
in
the
dirty
ashtray.
On
the
faded,
floral
tablecloth.
Grandpa
reaches
for
the
old
radio
With
a
mischievous
grin
And
early
swing
music
Dances
through
the
room.
We
laugh
And
I
dance
As
he
applauds
And
he
laughs
some
more.
After
many
moments,
hours
it
seems,
Of
tireless
laughter
and
smiles
and
twirls
and
dancing,
We
turn
off
the
radio
And
sigh
in
a
happy,
relaxed
way.
Grandpa,
How
can
you
be
so
happy
When
all
you
have
are
stubs
And
medicine
in
a
little
brown
bottle?
My
Fairy
Princess,
he
replies,
I
will
have
a
happy
heart
As
long
as
you
are
my
little
angel.
Grandpa
takes
a
sip
of
coffee
And
then
a
puff
of
the
dying
cigarette,
He
silently
smiles
at
me
with
his
tired
blue
eyes,
But
I
know
what
Grandpa
means
mi
I
will
always
be
his
little
angel.
Timeyus
up.
Put
your
pencils
down.
Weyure
going
to
go
around
the
table
and
share
what
we
wrote.
Share?
I
didnyut
know
if
I
could
re-read
the
poem
to
myself
without
letting
a
tear
escape.
And
now
I
have
to
read
it
to
a
group
of
strangers?
It
went
extremely
well,
despite
the
obvious
waver
in
my
voice.
The
workshop
director
invited
me
to
read
it
at
the
closing
ceremonies
as
an
example
of
a
mebeautiful
emotional
piece.mo
My
teacher
fell
in
love
with
its
interwoven
happiness
and
pain.
I
had
learned
to
write
about
something
sad.
Several
months
later
when
the
poem
came
out
in
the
literary
magazine,
my
mother
read
my
account
of
her
father
who
passed
away
almost
a
decade
earlier,
right
around
the
time
of
my
earliest
memory
of
him.
She
cried,
in
silence,
overwhelmed
by
emotion.
All
she
said
to
me
was,
meyou
remember
him?mo
as
I
nodded.
I
fell
asleep
that
night,
uneasy
at
my
motheryus
reaction
to
a
piece
that
I
never
told
her
I
wrote.
The
next
morning,
she
handed
me
three
pages
of
paper,
covered
front
and
back
with
black
ink.
She
was
infuriated
at
my
teacher
for
publishing
something
so
personal
and
angry
that
I
didnyut
consult
her
before
I
allowed
it
to
appear
in
the
magazine.
The
letter
she
handed
me
was
a
detailed
argument
about
why
my
poem
should
not
have
been
published
and
was
the
result
of
her
disturbed,
sleepless
night.
It
started
out
infused
with
anger
and
violation.
It
changed
into
a
detailed
account
about
my
grandfatheryus
difficult
life
and
the
reasons
for
his
sicknesses
that
I
could
not
have
possibly
known
before.
It
concluded
with
an
apology
for
being
so
sensitive,
then
with
a
word
or
two
of
gratitude
for
finally
being
able
to
release
the
pent-up
emotion
that
was
almost
ten
years
in
the
making.
Through
my
writing,
I
created
a
vehicle
of
healing
for
my
mother,
who
had
been
trying
to
deal
with
her
fatheryus
death
for
a
long
time.
I
created
a
pathway
for
the
information
that
she
proceeded
to
bestow
upon
me,
and
I
opened
up
a
line
of
communication
between
us
that
had
never
existed
before.
That
day,
I
learned
how
powerful
words
are
and
vowed
to
use
them
carefully
from
that
point
on.
R
Writing
became
a
constant
part
of
my
high
school
life,
and
often
times,
I
had
five
assignments
due
in
one
week.
I
had
guidelines,
but
for
the
most
part,
I
was
allowed
to
be
creative.
In
tenth
grade,
we
focused
on
contemporary
literature
analysis.
In
eleventh
grade,
I
wrote
at
least
three
papers
each
week
in
varying
genres
and
styles
for
my
AP
Language
and
Composition
class.
In
the
beginning
of
twelfth
grade
in
my
UConn
Co-op
English
course,
we
watched
Finding
Forrester.
I
learned
that
even
if
it
is
difficult
to
make
an
idea
materialize
into
a
coherent
story,
all
you
have
to
do
is
write
the
first
things
that
come
to
mind,
then
sift
through
the
ideas
and
pick
out
a
few
good
ones
upon
which
to
build
a
story.
I
proceeded
to
write
25-page
literary
analysis,
expository,
and
research
term
papers
in
preparation
for
college.
R
Freshman
year
of
college
came
and
went,
and
at
all
times
I
felt
ready
to
conquer
the
writing
assignment
on
a
new
level,
using
all
the
tools
I
had
picked
up
and
saved
since
1991.
I
wrote
a
brief
research
paper
every
other
week
for
my
FYS,
and
a
psychology
lab
report
once
a
month.
I
wrote
literary
analyses
in
Spanish
and
observations
about
the
economy.
My
little
sister
began
emailing
me
her
middle
school
papers
to
review
before
she
handed
them
in.
She
expected
that
I
would
correct
every
detail,
but
I
sent
them
back
to
her
with
general
suggestions
about
structure
and
focus.
This
angered
her
at
first,
but
once
she
started
following
the
suggestions,
she
started
earning
Ayus.
My
college
friends
dropped
by
with
their
papers
for
VASTs
and
other
classes
when
I
had
some
downtime,
and
I
showed
them
how
to
maintain
a
clear
focus
on
the
thesis
throughout
the
paper.
As
I
sit
here
now,
reflecting
on
the
13
years
of
writing
experience
I
have
tucked
under
my
belt,
I
am
amazed.
In
first
grade,
when
it
all
started,
I
never
planned
to
mold
myself
into
a
Writing
Associate
at
Lafayette
College.
I
wrote
only
for
the
day,
about
my
feelings
at
that
exact
moment
in
time,
and
I
did
the
best
I
knew
how.
Everything
I
learned
has
been
a
building
block
in
a
strong
foundation
that
has
supported
me.
Over
the
years,
my
development
as
a
writer
has
paralleled
my
growth
in
first
grade.
Get
the
ideas
down
on
paper
first,
and
then
slowly
build
upon
them
until
all
the
words
are
spelled
correctly
and
the
thoughts
in
order.
Even
now,
if
I
find
myself
at
a
loss
for
a
word
or
phrase,
I
leave
a
blank
to
fill
in
later.
There
is
always
an
opportunity
for
change
and
editing
is
always
possible.
I
have
learned
many
valuable
lessons
since
I
first
began
expressing
myself:
write
in
pencil,
donyut
be
afraid
of
reality,
and
donyut
attempt
to
harness
creativity.
This
is
how
I
get
my
thoughts
from
my
mind
to
paper.
