Literary
Narrative
My
earliest
memories
of
writing
in
school
are
from
the
second
grade.
I
lived
in
Philadelphia
at
the
time
and
was
attending
Greenfield
School,
kindergarten
through
eighth
grade.
While
my
memories
dating
back
to
second
grade
when
I
was
only
seven
are
scattered
and
few,
I
virtually
remember
our
library
and
our
writing
workshops.
I
loved
my
second
grade
teacher,
Mrs.
Straub.
She
was
very
influential
in
my
life
at
that
time.
It
was
that
year
that
I
really
developed
an
interest
in
reading
and
writing.
In
fact,
I
was
convinced
that
I
was
going
to
be
a
famous
author
and
illustrator
when
I
grew
up.
We
wrote
a
lot
in
that
class.
One
of
our
big
projects
was
a
book
of
baby
memories.
Each
student
in
the
class
wrote
a
story
about
one
of
their
earliest
memories
when
they
were
infants.
Each
of
our
short
anecdotes
and
corresponding
illustrations
were
bound
together
in
one
book,
and
at
the
end
of
the
year
we
each
received
a
copy
of
our
book
of
memories.
I
wrote
about
a
time
when
my
mom
and
I
were
in
a
food
market
and
I
was
sitting
in
the
shopping
cart
when
I
realized
I
had
lost
my
favorite
stuffed
animal.
It
was
quite
traumatizing
but
created
the
avenue
for
a
great
story!
That
year
I
also
vividly
remember
reading
several
stories
about
Stuart
Little.
These
were
the
original
stories
before
the
recent
motion
picture.
One
of
our
creative
writing
assignments
was
to
write
our
own
piece
of
fiction.
I
wrote
my
own
book
about
the
Littles.
I
was
very
proud
and
thought
I
was
well
on
my
way
to
fame
and
fortune!
I
suppose
some
of
my
interest
in
becoming
an
author
faded
over
the
next
couple
of
years.
I
soon
had
my
heart
set
on
becoming
a
veterinarian,
although
my
love
for
reading
had
certainly
grown.
Due
to
an
hour-long
bus
ride
to
and
from
school
every
morning
in
fourth
grade,
I
was
averaging
two
or
three
children's
books
a
week.
Fourth
grade
was
also
the
year
I
wrote
my
first
research
report.
My
paper
was
about
the
planets
and
it
was
one
of
the
first,
if
not
the
first
assignment
that
had
to
be
typed.
However,
I
did
not
know
how
to
type
so
my
mom
helped
me
in
that
area.
This
first
research
assignment
marked
the
beginning
of
my
mom's
involvement
with
my
papers
because
I
did
not
start
typing
my
own
papers
until
sometime
in
the
seventh
or
eighth
grade.
Now
I
think
I'm
a
faster
typist
than
she
is.
With
less
than
a
month
left
in
my
fourth
grade
year,
my
dad's
job
forced
us
to
move
from
West
Philadelphia
to
Central
New
Jersey.
I
finished
up
fourth
grade
at
Stony
Brook
Elementary
School
in
Branchburg.
I
don't
remember
too
much
from
this
year
except
that
the
classes
were
smaller
and
some
of
the
material
was
new.
I
didn't
have
to
take
any
quizzes
or
tests
in
that
last
month
but
I
still
tried
to
join
in
with
the
other
activities
in
class.
I
found
that
I
was
really
behind
some
of
the
other
students
in
certain
areas,
most
likely
due
to
the
different
school
districts
and
the
more
personal
attention
available
in
Branchburg.
In
fifth
grade,
it
took
me
the
first
couple
of
marking
periods
to
catch
up
with
everyone
else
and
adjust
to
some
of
the
differences.
About
half
way
through
that
year,
we
began
writing
another
research
paper.
In
my
class,
each
student
picked
a
state
to
write
about.
I
chose
Virginia
because
we
were
going
to
be
visiting
our
cousins
in
Williamsburg
in
the
winter.
At
first
I
thought
I
was
away
ahead
of
everyone
else
in
the
class,
because
I
had
already
written
a
similar
paper
and
this
was
their
first
one.
Instead,
I
quickly
realized
that
I
had
a
lot
of
new
things
to
learn.
This
was
the
first
time
that
we
utilized
an
outline,
both
subject
and
sentence,
and
this
technique
really
helped
me
to
organize
my
information.
I
also
enjoyed
writing
this
paper
a
lot
more
than
the
one
on
the
planets
because
I
found
the
material
more
interesting
and
more
personal
because
much
of
my
family
is
from
Virginia.
Since
I
liked
the
subject
more,
the
paper
itself
was
more
fun
to
write
and
the
experience
left
a
nice
impression
on
me.
My
teacher
gave
me
a
100
on
the
paper,
which
I
was
thrilled
about,
but
I
was
also
a
little
confused
because
there
were
a
few
errors
in
the
body
of
the
paper
that
she
had
marked.
When
I
asked
her
about
it,
she
said
that
those
small
errors
were
not
the
focus
of
her
grading
and
the
content
and
overall
grammar
deserved
the
A.
Her
comments
helped
me
to
understand
that
while
grammar
and
technique
are
important
for
clearly
expressing
ideas
and
main
points,
the
message
of
the
paper
has
higher
priority.
In
sixth
grade,
I
moved
to
the
middle
school.
This
was
the
first
year
that
I
had
separate
teachers
for
every
subject,
and
I
had
an
English
teacher
with
a
degree
in
English
rather
than
in
elementary
education.
In
my
English
class
we
were
constantly
writing.
I
distinctly
remember
three
large
projects.
The
first
was
a
fiction
story
that
we
each
wrote
to
enter
into
a
national
contest.
The
topic
for
these
fiction
short
stories
was
the
future.
I
remember
having
some
trouble
with
getting
started
with
my
story.
However,
once
I
got
some
ideas,
the
words
started
rolling
out.
After
I
had
the
basic
story
line,
I
actually
thought
of
an
exciting
ending
and
wrote
the
last
paragraph
of
my
story
before
I
started
anything
else.
I
didn't
win
the
contest
or
anything,
but
I
felt
pretty
good
about
my
story.
Our
second
project
was
another
research
paper.
This
time
I
chose
the
topic
of
Jewish
holidays
because
part
of
my
family
is
Jewish,
and
I
wanted
to
learn
more
about
their
religion.
On
this
paper,
my
teacher
focused
a
lot
on
the
note
cards
so
I
learned
how
to
extrapolate
interesting
and
pertinent
information
from
my
sources
and
how
to
organize
them
on
separate
note
cards.
Our
last
project
was
probably
the
most
interesting.
We
each
had
to
choose
a
topic
and
then
put
together
a
portfolio.
I
created
a
portfolio
on
dolphins,
and
the
portfolio
consisted
of
poetry
and
prose,
both
published
and
personal,
artwork,
and
any
other
medium
that
positively
contributed
to
the
collection.
I
was
exposed
to
many
types
of
poetry
and
to
interpreting
these
poems.
This
project
was
good
exposure
to
some
of
the
work
I
would
be
doing
in
the
future.
In
seventh
and
eighth
grade,
I
wrote
two
more
research
papers,
and
by
this
time
they
were
significantly
easier
to
put
together.
In
eighth
grade,
I
also
spent
the
entire
year
participating
in
a
Writing
Workshop
with
my
English
teacher.
The
workshop
was
set
up
to
allow
a
weeks
worth
of
class
time,
on
alternating
weeks,
for
independent
writing,
peer
editing,
teacher
conferences,
and
the
like.
We
had
the
liberty
to
write
about
anything
of
our
choice
from
fiction
to
poetry
to
nonfiction.
I
really
enjoyed
this
time
because
I
was
able
to
explore
many
different
styles
of
writing
and
we
were
free
from
strict
deadlines,
topics,
and
other
restrictive
guidelines.
Looking
back,
it
was
one
of
the
last
times
that
I
spent
so
much
time
on
creative
writing,
which
I
sometimes
miss.
A
highlight
for
me
was
having
my
poem
about
growing
up
in
Philadelphia
published
in
a
national
anthology
of
eighth
grade
poets.
When
I
got
into
high
school,
a
lot
of
things
changed.
The
bar
was
lifted
and
we
were
constantly
reminded
that
we
were
not
in
middle
school
anymore.
My
freshman
English
teacher
was
strict
and
difficult,
but
I
learned
and
retained
more
from
her
then
any
of
my
other
teachers
that
year.
We
wrote
numerous
essays
on
books,
both
in
and
out
of
class,
we
kept
weekly
journals
consisting
of
at
least
three
entrees
each,
we
were
immersed
in
grammar
and
proper
writing
techniques,
and
we
spent
an
entire
marking
period
writing
my
first
term
paper.
Our
first
book
essay
was
on
Charles
Dickens'
Great
Expectations.
It
was
a
take
home
essay
with
a
pre-selected
topic.
Our
high
school
grades
English
papers
on
a
split
scale,
half
content
and
half
style.
I
received
a
B/B
on
this
first
paper.
I
wasn't
really
used
to
receiving
Bs
but
when
I
saw
some
of
the
other
students'
grades
I
felt
better.
However,
in
addition
to
a
slightly
lower
grade,
which
at
this
point
in
my
life
I
am
very
accustomed
to,
my
entire
paper
was
marked
up,
crossed
out,
and
scribbled
over.
This
became
a
common
occurrence
in
her
class,
regardless
of
the
grade.
I
finally
received
an
A/A
on
my
last
paper
of
the
year
yet
the
multiple
corrections
seemed
to
indicate
a
much-reduced
grade.
My
biggest
learning
experience
that
year
was
our
third
marking
period
project.
Our
task
was
to
chose
an
American
author
and
a
piece
of
their
work
and
connect
the
book
with
the
author's
life.
It
was
the
first
time
I
had
to
research
a
piece
of
literature,
find
literary
criticism,
and
draw
parallels
to
the
author.
This
was
also
the
first
time
that
I
was
exposed
to
MLA
and
endnotes.
These
skills
proved
to
be
priceless
in
many
of
my
future
English
endeavors.
Finally,
I
have
never
forgotten
all
of
the
rules
of
grammar
that
were
drilled
into
my
head
that
year.
By
the
end
of
the
year
I
can
officially
say
that
I
had
stopped
making
the
same
errors
over
and
over
again
and
can
now
help
other
students,
even
at
Lafayette,
with
some
of
their
technical
errors
in
their
writing.
Eleventh
grade
was
the
year
of
my
next
big
learning
experience.
In
my
English
class,
in
addition
to
a
normal
course
load
of
work
with
novels,
plays,
poetry
and
essays,
we
spent
the
entire
year
working
on
a
thesis-centered
term
paper.
Our
object
was
to
choose
an
author
and
three
of
his
works
from
which
a
thesis
and
antithesis
could
be
developed.
I
chose
William
Faulkner,
two
of
his
novels
and
three
short
stories.
Throughout
the
year,
we
read
the
material,
wrote
up
plot
and
theme
summaries,
character
sketches,
and
researched
numerous
outlets
of
criticism
on
our
topics.
Through
this
experience
I
became
very
comfortable
with
finding
reliable
sources,
with
developing
and
systematically
supporting
both
a
thesis
and
antithesis,
and
with
utilizing
many
different
primary
and
secondary
sources
in
one
paper.
The
biggest
difference
from
this
paper
and
some
of
the
papers
I
have
written
in
college
however
is
the
time
length.
We
virtually
worked
on
this
project
for
an
entire
year,
while
many
of
the
papers
I
write
now
are
completed
in
a
few
weeks
or
less.
My
junior
year
was
also
my
senior
year,
more
or
less.
I
graduated
from
high
school
a
year
early
and
combined
these
two
years.
I
was
not
permitted
to
take
AP
English
however
because
I
had
not
technically
completed
my
junior
English
class
since
I
was
taking
them
both
at
the
same
time.
My
senior
English
class
was
not
much
to
talk
about
but
I
did
get
some
help
with
my
college
essays.
Some
of
my
other
classes
and
extra
curricular
activities
in
high
school
also
contributed
to
my
writing
abilities.
I
participated
in
a
debate
group
for
two
years
and
took
a
public
speaking
class
for
one
semester.
Both
of
these
exposed
me
to
writing
speeches
and
writing
in
away
that
could
be
clearly
expressed
audibly
to
a
live
audience.
These
public
speaking
skills
parallel
many
of
the
techniques
I
have
since
used
in
some
of
my
writing.
When
I
got
to
Lafayette,
I
was
hopeful
that
I
would
be
well
prepared
for
my
college
writing
classes,
but
I
was
still
slightly
worried.
During
the
first
semester,
my
freshman
seminar
was
my
only
writing
class.
At
first
I
was
a
bit
intimidated
because
our
first
five-page
paper
was
due
the
second
day
of
class.
The
class
only
met
once
a
week
so
we
virtually
had
a
week
for
the
paper
and
technically
even
less
because
of
WA
appointments.
We
also
had
no
topic
for
our
paper,
only
the
broad
subject
of
Popular
Culture,
the
name
of
my
seminar.
Many
students
indicated
their
worry
over
this
first
assignment,
and
at
first
I
shared
their
concern.
However,
I
soon
began
to
appreciate
the
freedom
we
had
and
actually
really
enjoyed
writing
the
paper.
While
some
of
the
others
were
intimidated
by
the
lack
of
topic
and
time,
I
worked
well
under
the
pressure
and
relished
the
opportunity
to
write
on
something
in
which
I
was
interested.
I
did
well
on
this
paper
and
continued
in
the
same
fashion
for
the
rest
of
the
semester.
For
each
assignment
I
was
able
to
chose
topics
and
develop
arguments
about
which
I
felt
very
strongly,
and
I
think
my
personal
interest
in
the
subject
matter
significantly
added
to
the
content
of
the
work.
My
performance
in
the
FYS
along
with
other
factors
such
as
writing
samples
and
SAT
scores
allowed
me
to
opt
out
of
College
Writing
and
I
took
Literary
Questions
in
the
second
semester.
This
was
probably
my
favorite
class
of
the
entire
year,
although
many
others
were
also
very
enjoyable.
We
read
very
interesting
material,
which
was
all
new
to
me,
we
had
stimulating
class
discussions,
and
I
loved
the
way
in
which
we
wrote
and
edited
our
papers.
Throughout
the
semester
we
wrote
six
papers
from
three
to
six
pages
in
length.
Each
paper
was
read
and
commented
on
by
the
professor
and
then
returned
for
revising.
At
least
one
of
the
six
was
distributed
to
the
entire
class
for
discussion
and
then
returned
for
further
revising.
At
the
end
of
the
semester,
we
had
to
choose
four
of
the
six
papers
to
hand
in
for
grading.
These
four
papers
made
up
a
portfolio
including
all
first
and
final
drafts.
I
felt
this
was
a
great
assessment
of
our
progress
throughout
the
semester,
and
it
really
helped
me
to
improve
my
writing,
both
of
each
individual
paper
and
in
general.
For
example,
I
noticed
obvious
improvements
in
the
papers
from
first
draft
to
final
draft
and
also
from
the
first
paper
to
the
sixth
paper.
In
writing
these
papers
I
also
gained
more
experience
in
research,
literary
criticism
and
thesis
development.
Two
of
the
skills
I
benefited
from
the
most
were
learning
to
turn
simple
plot
summaries
into
support
and
evidence
for
my
claims
and
how
to
develop
more
of
my
own
ideas
about
literature
by
utilizing
many
literary
schools
of
thought.
I
hope
that
my
future
English
classes
will
be
as
stimulating
as
this
one.
As
I
look
back
over
all
of
my
writing
experiences,
I
am
amazed
at
how
much
I
have
learned
and
grown.
I
can
now
see
that
I
have
always
had
an
interest
in
reading
and
writing
and
this
interest
has
developed
into
a
goal
for
the
future.
I
hope
to
continue
improving
my
writing
skills
and
exploring
new
realms
of
the
English
world
both
at
Lafayette
and
in
all
my
future
endeavors.
