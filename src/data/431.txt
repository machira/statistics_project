It
all
began
in
first
grade
with
poster-board-sized
paper
that
had
one
inch
lines
for
writing
and
five
inches
of
free
space
for
a
drawing:
my
career
as
a
writer.
Back
in
elementary
school,
the
main
purpose
of
my
writing
was
to
stretch
my
imagination,
work
on
my
penmanship,
and
improve
my
spelling.
I
loved
that
I
could
record
my
ideas
and
create
stories
to
share
with
my
mother
and
teacher.
In
fact,
I
thought
I
was
creative
and
brilliant
with
my
four
sentence
tales
of
animals
and
best
friends.
And
why
shouldnOt
I
have?
The
responses
I
received
from
my
family
and
teacher
were
all
positive
--
my
penmanship
was
decipherable,
my
stories
clever,
and
my
drawings
colorful.
The
only
criticisms
were
that
I
often
had
NfloatingO
letters
(the
letters
would
steadily
rise
above
the
line
as
I
wrote
a
word)
and
my
sentences
tended
to
be
run-ons,
neither
of
which
was
surprising
as
I
tried
to
write
as
quickly
as
I
thought
in
order
to
remember
the
ideas.
Yet,
at
that
point,
the
ideas
behind
the
writing
were
more
important
than
the
grammar,
and
I
enjoyed
using
my
writing
as
an
outlet
for
my
overactive
imagination.
Fifth
grade
seemed
to
be
the
turning
point
of
my
elementary
school
career,
when
it
started
becoming
more
of
a
hobby
than
a
school
subject.
This
began
when
I
opted
not
to
play
a
musical
instrument
with
the
majority
of
students
in
my
grade,
but
to
take
a
writing
class
instead.
I
found
that
I
enjoyed
this
class
more
than
others
and
even
looked
forward
to
it
--
I
loved
telling
stories,
making
up
characters,
and
creating
the
world
in
which
they
lived.
I
learned
how
to
write
a
rough
draft
and
proofread
it,
checking
for
spelling
and
grammar.
I
was
practicing
how
to
make
a
paragraph
with
a
topic
and
concluding
sentence
and,
for
first
time,
began
to
work
on
my
writing
technique.
In
eighth
grade,
I
took
another
creative
writing
class,
which
made
me
realize
just
how
much
I
enjoyed
writing,
and
not
just
for
the
praise
my
work
received.
While
there
were
grammar
lessons
and
assigned
readings
to
get
through,
the
majority
of
the
class
consisted
of
allowing
the
students
to
write
papers
based
on
a
given
topic.
I
liked
spending
the
class
time
brainstorming,
outlining
my
ideas,
and
typing.
The
computer
was
helpful
in
eliminating
the
need
to
double-check
spelling,
write
neatly,
and
measure
the
margins.
It
also
helped
me
work
on
my
still-persistent
problem
of
run
on
sentences.
Since
I
could
type
faster
than
I
could
write
by
hand,
I
could
concentrate
more
on
making
concise
sentences
rather
than
trying
to
write
down
all
my
thoughts
before
I
forgot
them.
My
favorite
part
of
the
class
was
typing
creative
stories
and
papers,
long
and
thorough.
The
purpose
was
not
about
answering
the
question
correctly,
but
focusing
on
writing
one
quality
paper.
My
short
stories
were
similar
to
the
mystery
novels
I
was
reading
at
the
time
and
I
was
proud
at
the
way
I
had
time
and
space
to
set
up
the
plot,
planting
clues
in
the
beginning
pages
that
would
play
out
later
in
the
story.
I
finally
began
to
write
for
enjoyment,
not
just
for
grades.
My
eight
grade
teacherOs
final
comments
on
my
work
were
very
complimentary
--
she
wrote
that
she
could
see
me
becoming
a
famous
author
and
invited
me
to
send
her
my
future
work
to
review.
While
the
compliment
made
me
think
more
seriously
about
whether
writing
was
really
something
I
was
talented
at,
I
doubted
my
formal
writing
skills.
That
summer,
my
older
sister,
Jenn,
began
assigning
Kara
and
I
essays
to
keep
us
busy
and
to
help
improve
our
writing
skills
(an
English
major
in
college
at
the
time,
she
did
this
after
reading
some
of
the
poorly
written
essays
my
other
sister
Kara
had
passed
in
and
received
AOs
on).
She
would
correct
our
first
draft,
we
would
make
the
changes,
pass
it
in
again,
and
the
cycle
would
continue
until
it
was
perfect.
Jenn
made
sure
to
assign
papers
that
would
be
interesting
for
us
to
write
and
she
taught
me
how
to
research
a
topic,
support
an
argument
with
evidence,
and
how
to
proofread.
She
took
time
to
look
over
the
papers
and
thoroughly
comment
on
them,
not
just
what
we
did
well,
but
what
we
needed
to
fix.
I
had
never
had
such
thorough
and
honest
feedback,
and
while
it
was
hard
to
take,
it
helped
my
writing
immensely.
There
were
definitely
a
few
tears
in
the
beginning,
when
it
would
seem
that
Jenn
had
found
errors
in
nearly
every
sentence,
convincing
me
that
I
was
an
awful
writer,
but
I
later
realized
that
she
was
only
holding
me
to
a
higher
standard.
It
was
not
that
I
wasnOt
talented,
I
was
just
better
than
what
I
was
passing
in.
In
the
coming
years
of
high
school,
as
I
got
used
to
JennOs
more
rigorous
proofreading,
I
recognized
that
it
taught
me
more
about
writing
than
most
teachers
ever
did.
It
was
not
until
my
tenth-grade
English
class
that
I
encountered
a
teacher
who
reviewed
my
essays
as
carefully
and
as
thoroughly
as
Jenn,
concentrating
on
my
improvement
as
an
individual
writer.
Ms.
Fox,
a
new
teacher
in
the
English
department,
spent
at
least
two
weeks
reviewing
the
classOs
papers
and
while
it
was
hard
to
wait
that
long
for
a
grade,
it
was
well
worth
it.
Every
paper
contained
grammatical
corrections,
side
notes,
and
a
paragraph
at
the
end
detailing
Ms.
FoxOs
reactions
--
what
we
did
well
on
and
what
we
needed
to
improve
both
on
this
and
future
papers.
She
identified
our
weaknesses
as
writers,
such
as
my
lack
of
sentence
variety
and
a
tendency
to
write
too
much
rather
than
short,
concise
ideas
(my
new
version
of
run-on
sentences).
This
thoroughness
was
new,
a
more
formal
version
of
my
sisterOs
proofreading.
I
began
practicing
my
own
writing
style
with
the
help
of
these
new
suggestions.
One
way
Ms.
Fox
helped
us
develop
our
style
was
with
journals.
It
was
the
first
time
I
had
to
write
so
informally
for
school
--
the
assignments
did
not
need
to
be
typed
and
were
often
personal
questions
that
were
loosely
related
to
the
novels
that
the
class
was
reading.
Although
this
assignment
was
intended
to
make
us
think
about
the
novels
in
a
more
personal
sense
and
to
seek
meaning
in
it
that
applied
to
our
lives,
it
also
helped
my
writing.
I
was
much
more
relaxed
and
casual
in
this
setting
because
it
was
only
worth
a
homework
grade
and
was
meant
to
focus
on
thoughts,
not
writing.
Once
I
became
used
to
using
a
more
casual
tone,
I
was
able
write
more
informally
in
my
essays,
making
them
less
stiff
and
more
enjoyable.
Also,
the
journal
was
a
perfect
way
to
think
through
my
thoughts.
Since
I
was
writing
them
by
hand,
I
just
wrote
what
came
to
mind,
without
worrying
about
editing.
This
allowed
my
mind
to
wander
without
focusing
on
the
paper
structure,
making
for
more
honest,
well-thought-out
ideas.
These
journals
showed
me
that
writing
was
a
perfect
outlet
for
sorting
out
thoughts.
I
realized
that
it
was
easier
to
think
through
problems
and
ideas
as
I
wrote
about
them,
so
I
bought
my
own
journal.
Using
a
pencil,
I
was
again
able
to
let
my
thoughts
flow
without
worrying
about
organization
or
run-ons.
Also,
since
it
was
for
my
own
personal
use,
my
entries
were
completely
honest.
When
I
had
a
too
much
on
my
mind,
I
would
write
down
everything
that
was
troubling
me.
By
the
time
I
was
done,
I
could
pinpoint
my
main
problem
and
solve
it.
After
writing
so
many
formal
essays
and
typing
all
day,
I
found
that
I
enjoyed
the
casual
and
personal
feel
of
a
journal.
Nonetheless,
I
still
loved
the
feeling
of
writing
a
well-received
formal
school
paper.
In
tenth
grade,
I
was
assigned
my
first
term
paper,
a
major
research
project
that
counted
for
almost
half
of
my
final
grade.
The
topic
assigned
was
to
discuss
a
turning
point
in
society
and
I
choose
to
write
about
the
development
of
photography
as
an
art
form.
I
had
never
worked
so
hard
on
a
paper.
Asking
art
teachers
for
advice,
taking
the
train
into
Boston
to
research
at
the
public
library,
and
making
conferences
with
Ms.
Fox
to
discuss
my
progress
took
more
time
than
I
imagined.
Yet,
for
the
first
time,
I
was
really
excited
about
my
work.
It
was
an
interesting
topic
and
I
liked
finding
more
research
to
make
my
paper
more
persuasive.
At
times,
however,
I
hated
it.
It
had
to
go
through
my
sisterOs
strict
review
multiple
times,
it
was
time
consuming,
and
often
very
frustrating.
I
wrote
the
whole
rough
draft
--
twelve
pages
--
and
then
had
to
reorganize
the
entire
paper.
Not
just
moving
paragraphs
around,
but
cutting
and
pasting
ideas
from
each
paragraph
to
create
new
ones,
which
also
meant
writing
new
transitions,
topic,
and
concluding
sentences,
an
aspect
of
writing
I
never
liked.
After
about
three
conferences
with
Ms.
Fox,
five
proofreads
by
Jenn,
and
my
own
personal
review,
I
passed
in
the
term
paper
and
received
an
A.
The
grade
was
definitely
a
reward
in
itself,
but
the
best
part
was
everyoneOs
reaction
to
it.
Ms.
Fox
had
all
good
comments
on
it
--
she
knew
it
was
my
best
work
and
her
praise
meant
a
lot
to
me,
since
she
was
not
one
to
use
it
lightly.
Even
Jenn,
my
toughest
critic,
was
impressed
with
my
work.
My
mother,
who
had
stopped
reading
my
tedious
English
essays,
asked
to
read
it
and
was
impressed
with
how
much
my
writing
had
improved.
Though
I
received
plenty
of
criticism
while
I
was
writing
it,
the
final
draft
only
received
praise
and
it
was
great
knowing
that
I
had
improved
my
first
draft
so
drastically
that
I
was
proud
and
wanted
to
share
it
with
others.
As
a
junior
in
high
school,
I
was
assigned
another
term
paper,
this
time
a
persuasive
argument
on
a
controversial
issue.
I
decided
to
argue
for
the
legalization
of
same
sex
marriages.
At
first,
I
was
uncertain
about
which
side
to
argue
but
since
I
was
not
anti-homosexual,
I
choose
to
argue
for
civil
unions.
The
more
I
researched,
the
more
certain
I
was
that
I
choose
the
correct
side.
It
made
me
angry
to
read
about
peopleOs
ignorance
and
disgust
of
an
entire
population
that
most
of
them
had
never
personally
encountered.
The
stories
of
hate,
crime,
and
prejudice
made
me
all
the
more
eager
to
write
my
thoughts
on
the
subject.
In
fact,
the
vehemence
with
which
I
disagreed
with
the
opposing
side
made
it
easy
to
write.
I
focused
on
five
main
points
and
presented
the
other
sideOs
position
first,
then
disproved
it
with
my
own
reasoning
and
research.
I
never
had
to
hide
facts
or
make
a
weak
argument
because
I
had
enough
materials,
facts,
and
research
to
make
all
of
the
other
arguments
as
weak
as
I
saw
them
to
be.
I
knew
exactly
what
I
was
doing
this
time
and
did
not
need
to
make
a
conference
with
my
teacher
--
I
wrote
my
paper
in
one
rough
draft.
The
topic
was
on
my
mind
all
the
time,
so
by
the
time
I
wrote
it,
I
had
organized
and
presented
it
in
my
head.
Even
when
Jenn
did
her
first
revision,
she
was
impressed
with
how
few
changes
she
had
to
make.
My
personality
came
through
on
this
paper
and
gave
it
a
definite
tone
and
style
because
I
wrote
exactly
how
I
felt.
I
was
proud
of
this
paper
more
than
any
others
and
wanted
to
share
it
with
people
to
test
whether
it
was
as
persuasive
as
I
hoped.
The
true
test
would
be
someone
who
was
on
the
opposing
side
and
was
willing
to
read
a
fifteen
page
high
school
studentOs
paper:
my
dad.
My
father
never
read
my
papers
and
I
was
surprised
when,
after
hearing
the
family
discuss
it
at
the
dinner
table,
he
asked
to
read
it.
I
was
curious
to
see
what
his
opinion
was,
both
of
my
writing
in
general
and
of
my
position.
Knowing
that
it
made
him
think
differently
meant
the
most
to
me.
His
opinion
on
the
topic
did
slightly
change:
he
was
still
not
in
favor
of
the
legalization
of
marriage,
but
he
did
believe
the
partners
should
at
least
receive
the
legal
benefits
of
a
civil
union.
Seeing
that
I
was
capable
of
using
my
writing
to
alter
my
stubborn,
middle-aged
fatherOs
set
beliefs
was
more
acknowledgement
of
the
success
of
my
paper
than
the
grade.
This
experience
made
me
see
how
well
I
could
write
when
the
topic
interested
me
and
I
enjoyed
the
feeling
of
believing
in
my
work.
By
the
time
senior
year
came,
this
enjoyment
of
writing
was
steadily
declining
with
the
increasing
numbers
of
papers,
responses,
and
college
essays
assigned.
Although
I
again
had
Ms.
Fox
for
a
teacher,
something
had
changed.
The
class
was
now
an
Advanced
Placement
one,
which
meant
the
pressure
of
passing
the
final
test
in
order
to
earn
college
credit.
We
were
being
taught
not
only
to
write
well,
but
to
write
quickly.
Since
the
AP
test
only
allowed
for
45
minutes
to
write
an
essay,
we
stopped
receiving
take-home
essays
and
began
writing
times
ones
in
class.
My
penmanship
was
becoming
indecipherable
as
I
rushed
to
finish
my
long-winded
thoughts
in
so
little
time.
However,
I
could
write
a
complete
and
well
written
essay
with
three
major
points
in
less
than
forty
five
minutes.
Though
I
could
do
it,
I
did
not
enjoy
it.
The
pressure
prohibited
me
from
exploring
new
techniques
or
being
creative
in
any
way.
There
was
too
little
time
to
prepare
an
interesting
or
original
essay;
as
long
as
the
prompt
was
fully
answered,
grammatically
correct,
and
the
time
limit
not
exceeded,
the
paper
was
a
success.
I
realized
that
I
was
losing
all
creativity;
when
assigned
a
rare
creative
writing
assignment,
I
had
trouble
adjusting.
My
formal
writing,
however,
was
definitely
improving.
My
demanding
teacher
consistently
graded
my
papers
as
AOs
and
used
them
in
the
class
as
an
example
of
good
writing
more
often
than
as
bad.
When
the
class
reviewed
my
work,
they
would
provide
insight
on
aspects
of
the
paper
that
I
had
overlooked,
and
they
often
identified
problems
I
was
struggling
with,
reinforcing
my
need
to
work
on
those
areas.
Despite
all
my
preparation
for
college
writing,
I
was
still
worried
when
I
came
to
Lafayette
that
I
would
not
be
as
qualified
as
the
other
students
or
that
I
would
not
meet
college
standards.
Perhaps
I
heard
one
too
many
stories
of
students
passing
in
their
first
papers
to
college
professors
only
to
have
them
returned
covered
in
red
ink,
and
so
I
was
petrified
to
write
my
first
college
assignment,
especially
after
months
of
no
schoolwork.
Despite
the
fact
that
this
first
paper
was
an
informal
response
to
a
sociology
question,
I
spend
hours
perfecting
my
two
page
answer.
The
more
I
wrote,
though,
the
easier
it
became.
My
informal
responses
took
less
time
to
write
and
I
did
equally
as
well.
I
was
happy
with
my
grades
and
reactions,
especially
since
I
did
not
have
Jenn
proofreading
them,
but
I
still
had
a
nagging
feeling
of
inadequacy.
The
moment
that
finally
reassured
me
that
I
was
satisfactorily
prepared
was
my
final
paper
for
a
womenOs
studies
class.
The
assignment
was
a
seven-page
paper
in
which
we
were
to
relate
a
current
news
article
to
a
topic
that
we
discussed
in
class.
I
choose
to
research
the
portrayal
of
political
wives
in
the
media
and
was
surprised
with
all
the
available
material.
It
was
a
topic
I
rarely
thought
about
before
my
research,
but
once
I
started
reading
articles,
I
found
it
incredible
how
similarly
each
women
was
portrayed
and
how
it
related
to
so
many
aspects
of
my
womenOs
studies
class.
It
was
easy
to
write
my
paper,
focusing
on
a
few
articles
that
stood
out
the
most,
and
I
was
happy
with
the
rough
draft.
I
passed
it
in
early
in
order
to
receive
my
professorOs
feedback
and
was
thrilled
with
her
comments:
she
told
me
that
even
if
I
passed
it
in
as
it
was,
it
would
be
adequate.
I
chose
to
make
the
corrections,
however,
so
that
it
would
be
something
I
was
really
proud
of
instead
of
another
average
paper.
When
I
passed
in
the
final
draft,
the
professor
indeed
graded
it
as
an
A,
but
also
said
that
it
was
one
of
the
best
in
the
class
and
recommended
that
I
consider
entering
in
a
womenOs
studies
conference.
Since
this
professor
was
a
member
of
the
English
department
and
my
class
was
filled
with
juniors
and
seniors,
I
was
finally
reassured
that
my
writing
was
adequate
for
college.
During
the
class
discussion
of
my
paper,
my
fellow
students
also
had
positive
comments.
Hearing
seniors
compliment
my
work
and
take
it
seriously
showed
me
that
I
was
just
as
capable
as
being
in
the
class
as
anyone.
My
familyOs
response
--
proud
but
not,
my
mother
said,
surprised
--
also
reassured
me
that
I
was
capable
of
writing
a
good
paper
on
my
own.
When
my
family
visited
me
for
Easter,
they
all
asked
to
read
it
and
had
good
things
to
say
about
it,
discussing
not
just
my
writing,
but
the
topic
and
my
ideas.
I
was
proud
to
spark
a
conversation
about
current
events,
hearing
their
ideas
on
the
both
the
subject
and
my
individual
findings.
I
finally
felt
confident
that
my
writing
and
the
ideas
behind
it
were
sufficient
for
the
college
level.
