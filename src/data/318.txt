"New
Writing
Associate"
Assignment
August,

Literary
Evolution
I
gazed
in
disgust
at
the
blank
yellow
sheet
of
paper
that
rested
upon
the
desk.
I
then
looked
up
and
regarded
my
fifth
grade
teacher
with
a
look
of
equal
of
contempt.
"Now,"
Mr.
Espo
was
saying,
"I
want
all
of
you
to
write
a
story
about
your
favorite
pet."
I
groaned
inwardly.
I
didn't
own
a
pet.
I
disliked
animals
primarily
because
they
made
my
brother,
who
had
severe
allergies,
sick.
Animals
also
tended
to
smell
funny--
especially
wet
dogs.
"Your
story,"
he
continued,
"must
be
at
least
250
words
long."
250
words!
The
class
gasped
in
horror.
Surely,
the
man
had
lost
his
mind.
I
wasn't
even
sure
I
knew
how
to
count
that
high!
How
was
I
supposed
to
write
something
on
a
topic
in
which
I
had
no
interest,
and
manage
to
make
it
an
astounding
250
words?
At
that
moment,
I
decided
I
hated
writing.
After
Mr.
Espo
had
passed
around
extra
sheets
of
yellow,
lined
composition
paper,
I
cautiously
raised
my
hand.
Mr.
Espo
peered
at
me
over
thick,
horn-rimmed
reading
glasses.
"Yes,
Ms.
Terzella?"
I
cleared
my
throat
nervously.
Speaking
in
front
of
a
class
always
made
me
a
bit
uneasy.
"What
if
we
don't
have
a
favorite
pet?"
I
queried.
"Well,
pretend
that
you
do,"
was
the
abrupt
answer.
"Oh."
I
wasn't
quite
sure
how
to
respond
to
that,
so
I
remained
silent.
Pretend?
Indeed,
that
was
an
interesting
concept.
I
shuffled
the
papers
on
my
desk,
attempting
to
stall.
Obviously,
there
was
no
way
out
of
this
assignment,
so
the
sooner
I
began,
the
sooner
I
could
finish
and
move
on
with
my
life.
I
sat
staring
straight-ahead,
mulling
over
animals
that
might
provide
an
interesting
topic
for
writing.
Snakes
and
reptiles
of
any
sort
were
definitely
out.
I
never
cared
much
for
cats.
Bunnies
were
okay,
but
they
weren't
the
most
intelligent
creatures.
Hmm..
.that
left
dogs.
Dogs
were
friendly
and
some
were
cute,
even
if
they
did
emit
a
displeasing
aroma
when
wet.
Besides,
I
always
had
a
bit
of
a
soft
spot
for
Lassie.
Of
course!
I
could
write
about
a
collie
dog.
I
grasped
my
pencil,
and
began
to
write
furiously.
Suddenly,
I
was
the
owner
of
a
3-year-old
collie
named
Daisy,
and
she
and
I
were
inseparable.
I
grew
more
and
more
exhilarated
as
I
wrote,
chronicling
the
adventures
between
my
hypothetical
pet
and
me.
The
words
seemed
to
flow
from
my
stubby
pencil,
and
when
I
finally
put
it
down,
I
had
managed
to
fill
three
pages,
front
and
back,
of
the
yellow
composition
paper.
I
sauntered
over
to
Mr.
Espo's
desk
and
placed
my
masterpiece
before
him
with
a
flourish.
He
regarded
me
with
raised
eyebrows.
"Finished?"
I
nodded
enthusiastically.
Mr.
Espo
put
on
his
horn-rimmed
reading
glasses
and
began
to
read
my
work.
I
anxiously
awaited
his
response.
He
finished
reading,
picked
up
his
red
pen,
and
after
pausing
briefly,
marked
a
glittering
"A"
at
the
bottom
of
the
last
page.
"Excellent,
Ms.
Terzella.
Keep
up
the
good
work."
I
cannot
even
begin
to
articulate
the
sense
of
elation
and
self-satisfaction
that
washed
over
me
at
those
words.
Maybe
this
writing
gig
isn't
that
bad
after
all,
I
thought.
Every
week
after
that,
Mr.
Espo
would
present
us
with
a
writing
topic,
and
we
would
have
to
formulate
either
a
composition
or
a
story.
I
found
myself
looking
forward
to
these
assignments.
I
was
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
be
creative
and
to
be
able
to
express
myself
through
writing.
I
found
that
I
enjoyed
writing
fiction
in
particular.
I
had
discovered
an
outlet
for
my
emotions,
and
I
was
able
to
express
my
ideas
through
the
development
of
characters
that
I
alone,
had
created.
I
was
in
total
control
of
my
writing--and
it
was
quite
a
heady
feeling.
The
years
passed,
and
I
continued
to
pursue
my
interest
in
creative
writing,
whether
with
anecdotes
about
my
life,
or
works
of
fiction.
Before
I
knew
it,
I
was
ready
to
embark
on
that
inevitable
tumultuous
journey
that
they
call
"high
school."
Mr.
Wasson
was
my
ninth
grade
English
teacher.
He
was
a
man
of
few
words,
who
possessed
an
exceedingly
dry
sense
of
humor
that
was
oftentimes
singed
with
sarcasm.
I
liked
him
immediately.
I
had
not
experienced
such
intense
grammatical
training
prior
to
his
class
or
since.
The
class
was
required
to
memorize
sheets
filled
with
grammar
rules
and
regulations.
We
were
then
given
"rote
quizzes"
from
the
sheets
on
a
regular
basis.
I
still
recall
50
of
the
most
common
prepositions
of
the
English
language
in
alphabetical
order!
Each
class
was
a
lesson
where
we
diagrammed
sentences
in
order
to
identify
coordinating
conjunctions,
direct
and
indirect
objects,
prepositional
phrases,
gerund
phrases,
participial
phrases,
adverbial
clauses,
and
so
forth.
Admittedly,
grammar
is
not
the
most
interesting
subject,
yet
Mr.
Wasson
made
it
enjoyable.
Perhaps
it
was
the
manner
in
which
he
presented
it,
discreetly
poking
fun
at
the
class
and
at
himself.
Perhaps
it
was
the
sentences
that
he
wrote--sentences
that
while
grammatically
perfect,
were
of
the
most
unique
subject
matter!
I
was
also
formally
introduced
to
the
writings
of
Shakespeare,
primarily
that
of
Macbeth.
I
clearly
recall
furiously
taking
notes
as
we
combed
through
the
tragedy
line-by-line,
identifying
symbolisms
and
foreshadowings,
and
discussing
their
pertinence
thereof.
These
discussions
allowed
me
to
begin
to
interpret
literature
on
a
different
level.
I
found
myself
looking
past
the
concrete
words
on
the
page
into
the
ideas
that
they
conveyed.
It
was
here
that
I
had
my
first
true
taste
of
literary
analysis.
I
wrote
countless
essays
regarding
the
themes
and
symbolisms
of
both
Macbeth,
and
other
works.
Each
essay
was
allotted
only
three
spelling
and
grammar
errors,
otherwise
it
was
returned,
and
then
rewritten.
This
class
forced
me
to
recognize
the
importance
of
diligent
writing.
Mr.
Wasson
stressed
that
a
literary
work
was
never
completely
finished,
and
that
improvements
could
always
be
made.
Proofreading
was
imperative,
and
one
should
take
complete
pride
in
one's
work.
Yet,
he
also
encouraged
the
development
of
original
ideas
surrounding
a
literary
work.
New
perspectives
were
always
welcomed,
and
an
answer
was
never
considered
"incorrect."
The
skills
I
acquired
in
this
class
are
skills
that
I
still
carry
with
me,
nearly
six
years
later.
And
so
passed
the
high
school
years,
accompanied
by
minor
teenage
crises
such
as
disastrous
first
dates,
acne,
and
of
course,
the
incessant
flood
of
English
papers.
Most
of
these
papers
were
analytical,
and
very
seldom
would
I
write
a
creative
paper
for
a
class.
I
found
that
I
missed
creative
writing
tremendously.
Granted,
I
would
occasionally
write
a
story
or
essay,
generally
for
a
family
member,
but
due
to
time
constraints,
I
was
unable
to
write
as
much
as
I
would
have
liked.
It
wasn't
until
senior
year
of
high
school
that
I
was
reunited
with
my
first
"love."
I
took
a
creative
writing
class,
and
truly,
it
was
one
of
the
most
emotionally
rewarding
classes
of
my
high
school
career.
College
application
deadlines
loomed
before
me,
and
I
suppose
one
might
say
that
I
was
on
the
verge
of
"freaking
out."
My
world,
as
I
knew
it,
was
about
to
become
upset:
a
new
school,
new
friends,
and
a
new
life.
These
issues
profoundly
affected
my
writing,
and
I
had
re-discovered
the
wonderful
emotional
outlet
of
writing--a
discovery
I
had
first
made
seven
years
prior,
in
Mr.
Espo's
class.
My
creative
writing
teacher,
Mr.
Albano,
was
hardly
one
who
adhered
to
literary
conventions.
He
bombarded
the
class
with
writing
genres:
dramatic
monologues,
poems,
plays,
autobiographical
stories,
"in
media
res"
pieces,
and
so
on.
However,
I
particularly
enjoyed
the
"free
choice"
assignments,
whereupon
we
were
allowed
to
write
in
any
genre,
and
upon
any
topic
we
chose.
"Be
original!"
Mr.
Albano
would
bellow,
pacing
across
the
front
of
the
room.
"Say
what
you
feel
and
to
hell
with
everything
else!"
These
declarations
were
generally
followed
by
his
fist
pounding
on
the
chalkboard,
his
feet
stamping
the
floor,
or
his
arms
flailing
wildly.
"If
you
want
to
write
about
your
neighbor
who
is
holding
aliens
hostage
in
the
dog
house
in
his
backyard,
then
do
it!"
A
few
chuckles
were
emitted
from
the
class.
"If
you
wish
to
tell
about
your
Uncle
Charlie
who
can
burp
the
alphabet
in
twelve
languages
while
standing
on
his
head,
then
do
it!"
This
time
the
class
roared
with
laughter.
"You
may
rant,
you
may
rave,
but
you
must
writel
"
No,
I've
never
met
anyone
else
quite
like
Mr.
Albano.
His
unbounded
enthusiasm
had
a
profound
effect
upon
me.
He
often
told
me
I
possessed
a
certain
flair
for
writing,
and
he
continuously
encouraged
me
to
cultivate
my
ability.
Two
years
later,
I
found
myself
sitting
in
a
rather
sunny
classroom
while
my
English
professor
outlined
the
requirements
for
our
next
paper.
"Now,"
he
began,
brushing
the
seemingly
perpetually
present
chalk
dust
from
his
sports
coat,
"I
am
basically
going
to
leave
the
topic
for
the
next
paper
to
your
discretion.
All
I
require
is
that
you
write
on
one
of
the
works
we
have
studied
thus
far.
Pick
out
any
area
within
any
one
of
these
works
that
you'd
like
to
explore
further."
I
suppressed
a
groan
of
despair.
There
were
so
many
areas
of
the
readings
that
could
be
explored!
I
was
hardly
thrilled
at
the
prospect
of
choosing
a
topic.
I
do
not
consider
myself
to
be
a
decisive
person.
"Are
there
any
questions?"
A
student's
hand
shot
into
the
air,
and
he
posed
that
vital
question
to
which
all
college
students
enrolled
in
literary
writing
courses
must
have
an
answer.
"How
long
does
it
have
to
be?"
"Only
four
to
five
pages
in
length,
due
next
Thursday,"
my
professor
responded,
now
brushing
chalk
dust
off
of
his
leather
briefcase.
"I
really
want
you
to
hone
in
on
a
topic."
He
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair.
"Are
there
any
other
concerns?"
The
students
shifted
restlessly.
It
was
nearly
4:00pm
on
a
gorgeous
Thursday
afternoon,
and
everyone
was
hoping
that
there
were
no
further
concerns.
He
began
to
gather
up
the
sea
of
papers
on
his
desk.
"Okay,
you
guys
can
go."
The
sound
of
books
slamming
mingled
with
the
excited
conversing
of
students
as
they
exited
the
room.
As
I
haphazardly
dumped
my
belongings
into
my
backpack,
I
began
to
wonder
how
I
was
going
to
write
this
paper.
I
decided
that
having
few
boundaries
in
a
paper
was
far
worse
than
being
assigned
to
a
paper
that
must
follow
an
exceedingly
strict
outline.
I
promised
myself
that
I
as
soon
as
I
arrived
at
my
room,
I
would
sit
at
my
desk
until
I
had
devised
a
topic...
Two
days
before
the
paper
was
due,
I
had
a
revelation.
I
decided
upon
a
topic,
and
was
quite
pleased
with
my
decision.
I
immediately
launched
into
the
assignment,
relieved
that
the
revelation
had
occurred
before
the
paper
was
due.
I
thought
I
had
a
valid
argument,
and
after
submitting
the
finished
work,
I
was
anxious
to
learn
of
my
professor's
reaction.
A
week
later,
my
professor
stood
before
us,
holding
the
stack
of
graded
papers.
A
streak
of
unnoticed
chalk
dust
meandered
down
the
front
of
his
sports
coat.
He
wore
a
rather
somber
expression.
"I
thought
you
guys
would
have
done
better
with
these
papers."
This
statement
was
hardly
encouraging.
I
began
to
grow
a
trifle
uneasy.
"I'm
not
sure
what
happened,"
he
continued.
"Perhaps
I
wasn't
clear
enough
on
the
assignment."
He
paused
for
a
few
moments.
No
one
stirred.
"So,
I
guess
I'll
hand
them
back,
and
then
entertain
questions."
I
could
practically
see
the
red
ink
oozing
from
my
paper
before
it
was
even
placed
on
my
desk.
I
winced
slightly,
then
briefly
glanced
through
the
pages,
noting
the
dreaded
remark
on
the
last
page:
See
me
after
class.
I
was
already
into
the
third
semester
of
my
college
career,
and
I
had
never
received
a
graded
paper
such
as
this.
I
was
absolutely
mortified.
I
reluctantly
approached
my
professor
after
class,
as
per
demand
on
the
last
page
of
the
red
ink-ridden
paper.
"Christine,
what
happened?"
he
questioned
bluntly.
"I-I-don't
know,"
I
stammered.
"I-I-thought
I
had
a
strong
argument."
"Well,
you
did,"
my
professor
acknowledged,
"but..."
Thus
began
our
45-minute
discussion
about
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
my
paper.
As
we
went
through
page
by
page,
my
errors
became
increasingly
apparent.
I
was
thoroughly
disgusted
with
myself
for
not
having
realized
them
while
writing
the
paper,
yet
I
was
very
grateful
to
my
professor
for
taking
the
time
to
review
the
paper
and
further
explain
his
notations.
I
suppose
he
sensed
my
disappointment.
"Christine,"
he
began,
handing
the
paper
to
me,
"you
are
a
good
writer.
I've
seen
your
other
work.
Do
not
let
this
one
grade
sour
you
on
future
assignments.
Now
you
know
what
mistakes
to
look
out
for.
Try
to
view
this
as
a
learning
experience,
and
apply
what
you've
learned
towards
the
next
assignment,
okay?"
I
nodded,
and
even
managed
a
smile.
Perhaps
he
was
correct.
Developing
as
a
writer
is
an
ongoing
process.
Isn't
that
what
my
teachers
had
been
telling
me
all
of
these
years?
Writing
is
not
about
failing.
Writing
is
about
growing;
it's
about
straightening
yourself
up
after
stumbling,
dusting
the
chalk
dust
from
your
sports
coat,
and
beginning
again
with
renewed
vitality.
Maybe
next
time
I'll
write
about
my
favorite
pet.
