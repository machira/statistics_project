Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative
Project
for
Workshop
August,
2003
Each
summer
as
I
prepare
to
write
the
Writing
Associate
literacy
narrative,
I
try
to
think
carefully
about
all
of
my
writing
experiences
over
the
course
of
the
past
year
and
how
my
writing
has
improved
because
of
them.
As
I
search
for
something
profound
to
say
about
my
growth
as
both
a
writer
and
a
Writing
Associate,
I
find
that
I
often
exaggerate
the
significance
that
a
particular
experience
had
on
my
writing
or
I
dedicate
hours
of
my
time
attempting
to
recall
a
specific
event
that
forever
impacted
my
work
as
a
writer
or
a
Writing
Associate.
In
my
desperate
quest
to
type
something
meaningful
on
the
page,
I
now
realize
that
I
expended
too
much
effort
thinking
about
how
my
writing
had
changed
or
recalling
conversations
with
students
in
WA
conferences
that
were
particularly
productive.
In
my
attempt
to
be
poignant
I
never
considered
what
I
valued
most
in
the
writing
process:
organization,
not
just
of
a
piece
of
writing,
but
of
assignments
and
professorOs
expectations.
I
am
a
compulsive
organizer
and
planner.
Without
my
daily
planner
I
feel
anxious
and,
as
many
of
my
closest
friends
will
attest
to,
spontaneity
is
not
my
forte.
These
sentiments
correspond
to
my
attitude
of
writing
and
the
writing
process.
When
given
an
assignment,
I
expect
to
be
told
exactly
what
the
professor
is
looking
for:
the
length,
format,
general
argument,
and
topics
to
be
discussed
in
the
body
of
the
paper.
My
most
frustrating
experiences
with
writing
assignments
at
Lafayette
came
from
a
professor
I
had
for
three
courses,
the
last
of
which
was
first
semester
of
the
past
year.
His
assignments
were
long
and
complicated,
printed
in
8-point
font
and
consuming
over
three
pages.
While
his
descriptions
were
lengthy,
they
were
anything
but
clear
and
precise.
For
example,
while
nearly
half
a
page
was
dedicated
to
describing
a
thesis
the
need
for
the
statement
to
be
argumentative,
there
was
no
indication
of
what
the
thesis
should
argue
or
what
the
substance
of
the
paper
should
include.
The
remainder
of
the
assignment
was
vague
and
filled
with
rhetorical
questions
the
professor
expected
us
to
address
in
the
paper;
however,
he
never
was
satisfied
with
our
answers
to
the
dilemmas
he
presented.
In
addition
to
my
need
to
plan
and
organize
nearly
every
aspect
of
my
life,
I
admit
that
I
am
somewhat
of
a
perfectionist.
After
three
semesters
of
reading,
dissecting,
analyzing,
and
attempting
to
conquer
my
professorOs
cryptic
assignments,
I
became
frustrated
in
my
seeming
inability
to
meet
his
vague
expectations.
I
spent
hours
in
his
office
discussing
assignments
and
asking
questions,
but
I
was
never
given
a
clear
answer
--
in
fact,
I
often
left
a
conversation
with
the
professor
with
more
questions
than
I
started
with.
Eventually,
I
realized
that
achieving
perfection
in
one
of
this
particular
professorOs
assignments
was
an
impossible
task.
Since
I
have
never
been
(and
do
not
presume
to
be)
a
creative
writer,
in
part
due
to
my
need
to
adhere
to
a
clear
assignment,
I
came
to
despise
writing
assignments
from
this
professor.
After
completing
an
essay
for
his
class,
I
was
overwhelmed
with
frustration
and
attempts
to
analyze
every
word
I
wrote
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
discern
what
was
learned
by
completing
the
essay.
At
the
end
of
the
semester,
I
consoled
myself
with
the
thought
that
while
my
writing
my
not
have
improved,
at
least
I
could
share
my
experience
with
others
who
encounter
similar
frustrations
with
assignments
and
professors.
Although
a
large
portion
of
my
time
and
effort
during
the
first
semester
was
dedicated
to
decoding
my
professorOs
vague
assignments,
I
was
relieved
to
be
taking
another
course
in
which
the
professor
was
extremely
organized
and
straightforward
in
her
presentations
to
the
class
and
the
assignments
she
wrote.
Moreover,
when
approached
with
a
question
regarding
the
assignment,
her
responses
were
easy
to
understand
and
after
discussing
the
assignment
with
her
I
left
feeling
confident
in
my
ability
to
produce
a
quality
piece
of
writing.
This
professor
encouraged
the
class
to
be
creative
in
writing
styles,
but
we
did
not
need
to
waste
time
and
become
frustrated
in
attempts
to
creatively
interpret
the
professorOs
assignments
(unlike
the
situation
in
the
class
I
described
previously.)
During
the
first
semester
of
my
junior
year
I
came
to
recognize
what
I
value
most
about
writing
assignments
and
the
teaching
methods
of
my
professors.
While
this
insight
was
helpful
to
me
in
my
approach
to
future
writing
assignments,
it
was
also
helpful
to
me
as
a
Writing
Associate.
Throughout
the
second
semester,
I
asked
the
professor
I
was
working
with
to
send
me
a
copy
of
the
classesO
writing
assignments
before
she
distributed
them
so
that
we
could
discuss
any
areas
that
I
thought
may
be
in
need
of
clarification.
This
process
made
my
conferences
with
the
students
more
successful
because
I
was
able
to
better
answer
questions
about
the
assignment
and
I
was
aware
of
aspects
of
the
writing
that
the
professor
was
particularly
concerned
about.
Although
I
realize
that
the
perfect
assignment
may
never
exist,
my
experience
has
taught
me
how
to
cope
with
difficult,
confusing,
and
vague
directions
both
as
a
writer
and
as
a
Writing
Associate.
I
strongly
recommend
that
new
Writing
Associates
be
sure
to
discuss
assignments
with
the
professors
of
the
courses
they
are
assigned
in
order
to
clarify
confusions
they
might
have
in
reading
the
papers
and
to
have
more
productive
conferences.
The
most
valuable
advice
I
have
for
new
Writing
Associates
is
to
be
diligent
in
communicating
with
both
the
professor
and
students
you
are
working
with.
While
I
am
not
suggesting
that
it
is
your
duty
send
out
daily
email
reminders
for
meetings,
it
is
important
that
the
students
and
professor
are
aware
of
your
expectations
for
them,
and
that
you
understand
their
expectations
of
you.
Open
communication
will
eliminate
many
stresses
that
Writing
Associates
face
and
will
make
conferences
more
productive.
Furthermore,
it
is
critical
to
set
up
basic
Nground
rulesO
at
the
start
of
the
semester:
make
your
policy
for
missed
or
unprepared-for
conferences
clear,
distribute
your
contact
information,
and
explain
your
role
as
a
peer
who
is
available
to
discuss,
rather
than
correct
the
studentsO
writing.
With
these
clarifications,
your
work
as
a
Writing
Associate
will
be
more
rewarding
and
you
will
not
have
any
misgivings
about
enforcing
your
policies
throughout
the
semester.
During
the
spring
semester
of
my
junior
year
I
took
my
first
course
in
the
Lafayette
English
Department.
In
high
school
I
took
AP
English
and
therefore
College
Writing
was
not
a
requirement
I
needed
to
fulfill
at
Lafayette.
Although
my
second
semester
English
class
was
only
a
200-level
course,
I
was
nervous
about
writing
in
a
discipline
I
had
not
studied
since
high
school.
The
assignments
differed
greatly
from
those
I
was
accustomed
to.
In
the
majority
of
my
courses
at
Lafayette,
my
writing
focused
on
interpretations
others
had
of
writing
or
politics
and
required
me
to
argue
for
one
opinion
over
the
other.
The
assignments
in
the
English
course
required
me
to
produce
and
analyze
my
own
interpretations
of
literature.
Despite
my
confidence
in
my
understanding
of
the
material
discussed
in
class,
I
was
uneasy
about
translating
my
thoughts
into
writing
because
I
was
unfamiliar
with
the
expectations
of
English
professors
and
how
to
approach
the
assignments.
Fortunately,
several
of
my
fellow
Writing
Associates
were
English
majors,
and
they
helped
to
ease
my
anxiety
over
the
assignments
and
to
interpret
the
questions
posed
by
the
assignment.
Although
I
did
not
recognize
a
drastic
change
in
my
writing
as
a
result
of
the
English
course,
I
noticed
an
improvement
in
my
writing
process
and
my
ability
to
interpret
assignments.
This
summer,
I
worked
as
an
EXCEL
scholar
in
the
Government
and
Law
Department,
researching
the
Constitutionality
of
certain
abstinence-only
sex
education
programs
in
public
schools.
Since
my
professor
and
I
initiated
the
project
this
summer,
my
work
was
confined
to
research
and
did
not
involve
a
great
deal
of
writing,
apart
from
outlining
articles
I
read
and
composing
Excel
spreadsheets.
The
experience
taught
me
how
to
combat
a
research
project
from
the
beginning
phase
D
where
to
find
information
I
needed,
how
to
sort
through
hundreds
of
articles
to
identify
those
that
were
most
relevant,
and
I
learned
that
the
plan
we
had
before
starting
the
research
would
undergo
several
changes
and
lead
us
in
new
directions
over
the
course
of
three
months.
My
interviewing
skills
improved,
as
I
conducted
nearly
200
phone
interviews
with
abstinence
education
coordinators
in
crisis
pregnancy
centers
across
the
country.
The
skills
I
acquired
through
the
EXCEL
research
will
undoubtedly
be
valuable
to
me
when
I
begin
my
Honors
Thesis
in
the
fall
semester
and
have
improved
my
approach
to
the
writing
process.
Before
beginning
the
project,
I
assumed
we
would
finish
all
the
research
this
summer
and
produce
a
paper
by
September;
I
now
realize
that
even
after
three
months
of
research
writing
a
paper
would
be
nearly
impossible.
This
knowledge
has
improved
my
understanding
of
the
importance
of
completing
all
aspects
of
research
and
preparation
before
attempting
to
produce
any
form
of
writing.
My
experience
as
a
Writing
Associate
proved
helpful
to
my
work
as
an
EXCEL
scholar
when
I
was
honored
to
be
asked
by
my
professor
to
read
an
article
she
recently
wrote
and
offer
my
critiques.
The
critical
reading
skills
I
gained
as
a
Writing
Associate
helped
me
to
focus
on
the
content
of
the
article
and
to
develop
a
set
of
questions
for
my
professor
about
her
piece.
Despite
my
initial
concerns
about
reading
my
professorOs
writing
and
producing
useful
feedback,
I
overcame
my
fear
quickly
because
of
my
training
as
a
Writing
Associate
and
my
experience
conferencing
with
writers
and
discussing
their
work.
Despite
the
frustrations
I
encountered
this
year,
I
learned
what
I
value
most
in
my
work
both
as
a
writer
and
a
Writing
Associate,
and
how
to
manage
difficult
situations
in
conferences
and
in
my
own
writing
process.
Recognizing
the
importance
of
clarity
and
organization
to
my
own
writing
process,
I
tried
to
be
clear
and
organized
in
my
work
with
fellow
students
and
professors
as
a
Writing
Associate.
When
I
wrote
the
Writing
Associate
Literacy
Narrative
before
my
sophomore
and
junior
years,
I
found
that
while
my
essays
attempted
to
analyze
every
aspect
of
my
writing
and
how
it
improved
or
changed
in
the
past
year,
the
narratives
were
not
accurate
representations
of
me
as
a
writer.
I
understand
that
this
yearOs
Literacy
Narrative
may
not
be
my
most
organized
or
coherent
work,
but
unlike
my
two
previous
narratives,
it
is
the
most
honest
representation
of
my
growth
and
values
as
a
writer.
