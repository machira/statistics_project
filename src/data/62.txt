Literacy

Project
for
Workshop
With
a
red
Crayola
crayon
and
my
mother's
artist's
sketch
pad,
I
learned
to
write
my
name
when
I
was
two
and
a
half.
I
practiced
over
and
over
again
until
my
writing
was
almost
as
neat
as
that
of
my
best
friend,
Patsy.
Patsy
was
two
years
older
than
I
and
therefore
had
much
more
experience.
When
I
began
kindergarten,
my
skill
in
writing
had
not
improved
significantly,
but
I
was
at
least
able
to
write
my
brother
Daniel's
name
also!
My
excellence
in
writing
truly
became
evident
when
I
was
in
first
grade.
That
is
when
I
began
making
entries
in
my
Strawberry
Shortcake
diary
that
I
had
received
for
my
sixth
birthday.
By
the
end
of
first
grade
I
had
completed
three,
four
line
entries
in
my
little
diary.
I
have
to
admit
that
although
the
concepts
in
those
twelve
lines
of
writing
were
profound,
topics
such
as
how
I
had
a
headache
and
nobody
cared,
and
how
all
the
boys
in
my
class
whom
I
liked
and
who
liked
me
occupied
my
thoughts,
my
spelling
was
much
like
it
is
today,
somewhat
flawed.
But
as
long
as
I
was
able
to
read
it,
spelling
didn't
matter!
As
I
became
a
better
reader,
my
writing
truly
did
improve
.
In
sixth
grade
my
teacher,
Mr.
Karlin,
inspired
the
class
to
become
very
creative
and
imaginative.
We
read
a
number
of
mystical
books,
such
as
The
Lion,
the
Witch,
and
the
Wardrobe,
and
My
Side
of
the
Mountain.
We
were
given
many
assignments
asking
us
to
invent
things
or
to
write
creative
works
such
as
stories
or
poems.
I
began
to
become
very
interested
in
writing.
Every
week
we
were
given
a
topic
and
for
homework
we
would
have
to
write
a
story.
This
is
when
I
learned
to
use
my
father's
IBM
word
processor.
I
would
spend
a
few
hours
working
at
his
computer
and
try
to
write
the
most
creative
stories
that
I
could
imagine.
After
I
finished,
either
my
mother
or
my
father
would
proof
read
and
comment
on
my
works.
Most
of
the
feedback
was
very
complimentary,
and
often
my
parents,
teacher,
or
friends
would
tell
me
that
I
should
consider
doing
some
writing
as
an
author
of
children's
literature.
Remembering
my
favorite
stories
as
a
child,
I
decided
that
I
would
love
someday
to
write
stories
for
the
Little
Golden
Books
collection.
Since
I
already
knew
that
I
would
be
an
elementary
school
teacher
when
I
grew
up,
I
decided
that
my
future
children's
literature
writing
would
have
to
be
done
over
the
summers
when
I
would
have
more
time.
In
seventh
grade
I
encountered
an
obstacle
in
my
experience
as
a
writer.
I
began
to
be
assigned
research
papers
in
my
science
and
history
classes!
Up
to
this
point
all
I
had
been
asked
to
write
were
book
reports
and
creative
writing
papers,
all
of
which
I
had
found
rather
easy.
I
was
not
at
all
excited,
however,
by
this
next
required
writing
demand,
although
I
knew
that
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
become
a
well
rounded
student
and
writer.
This
is
the
stage
in
my
writing
development
when
my
intelligent
and
very
helpful
father
stepped
in.
The
night
before
a
research
paper
was
due,
I
would
wait
until
after
dinner
and
then
go
into
my
father's
den
to
begin
to
write
the
paper
off
the
top
of
my
head.
Unfortunately
it
would
never
be
quite
that
easy!
Usually
by
9:30pm
I
would
start
to
become
very
frustrated
staring
at
the
sole
word
on
the
computer
screen
that
had
been
sitting
there
next
to
the
steadily
blinking
cursor
ever
since
I
had
typed
it
a
few
hours
earlier.
Soon
I
would
start
to
cry
and
become
very
pessimistic
about
life,
realizing
that
my
bed
time
was
in
half
an
hour
and
that
there
was
no
way
for
me
to
possibly
write
a
paper
by
then!
But
soon
dad
would
come
to
my
rescue.
"Ok
Carrie,"
he'd
say,
"I'll
write
the
opening
sentence
for
you,
just
to
get
you
started."
Without
a
blink
of
hesitation
I
would
quickly
slide
over
and
allow
him
to
go
to
work.
Often
he
would
get
on
a
roll,
and
his
opening
sentence
would
turn
into
an
opening
paragraph.
Then
he
would
return
to
his
desk
to
do
his
own
work
and
leave
me
all
alone
to
continue.
Please
understand
that
my
compassionate
father
is
an
English
professor
and
would
write
the
introduction
to
his
seventh
grade
daughter's
research
papers
as
if
he
were
writing
another
doctoral
dissertation!
He
would
leave
me
with
a
single
sentence
or
paragraph
and
in
absolute
confusion
as
to
what
my
paper
was
even
supposed
to
be
about.
So
after
another
long
and
torturous
hour
at
the
computer
which
was
spent
looking
up
in
the
dictionary
all
the
words
that
my
father
used
in
the
introduction
in
order
for
me
to
attempt
to
acquire
at
least
some
faint
understanding
of
his
brilliant
opening,
I
would
finally
admit
my
lack
of
success,
and
again
become
very
frustrated.
Soon,
by
this
time,
my
somewhat
annoyed
father
would
approach
me
with
the
usual
lecture:
"You
know,
Carrie,
you
would
not
be
having
this
problem
right
now
if
you
had
started
this
paper
last
week!"
I
would
agree,
tell
him
how
sorry
I
was,
and
that
I
wold
never
procrastinate
again
if
he
would
help
me
just
one
more
time.
Giving
in,
he
would
sit
down
at
the
computer
and
I
would
sneak
off
to
bed..
In
the
morning,
on
the
table,
would
be
my
superbly
written
error
free
research
paper!
My
father
would
make
me
read
it
so
as
to
ensure
my
understanding
of
any
vocabulary
words
or
other
terms
and
concepts
that
I
might
not
otherwise
have
been
familiar
with.
This
process
basically
continued
up
through
eleventh
grade.
Naturally,
in
eighth
grade,
I
was
placed
an
a
ninth
grade
honors
English
class
and
always
received
A's
on
my
papers.
But
to
be
quite
truthful,
my
father's
generous
assistance
actually
did
help
me.
Through
hours
of
working
with
him
side
by
side
at
the
computer
I
learned
much
about
grammar,
writing
style,
and
the
meaning
of
many
words.
If
I
ever
wrote
anything
on
my
own
and
allowed
my
father
to
read
it,
he
would
basically
rewrite
it
in
order
to
make
it
sound
better.
Eventually
I
developed
a
writing
technique
of
my
very
own,
and
it
was
one
that
my
father
would
not
criticize.
When
I
would
write
a
paper,
I
would
try
to
think
and
write
exactly
like
my
father.
Finally
I
began
to
hear
compliments
from
him
on
my
own
writing
and
my
grades
remained
good.
Perhaps
my
writing
skills
may
have
developed
a
little
differently
from
those
of
my
peers,
but
overall
I
believe
that
my
father's
help
was
an
asset
to
my
writing.
By
my
junior
year
in
high
school
I
was
a
confident
writer
who
enjoyed
being
given
written
assignments.
I
would
still
ask
my
father
to
proof
read
or
aid
me
slightly
stylistically,
but
in
general
I
had
finally
become
an
independent
writer.
Throughout
high
school
I
again
kept
a
voluntary
journal
and
was
religious
about
writing
in
it.
I
also
wrote
many
stories
about
things
that
happened
in
my
life.
When
my
best
friend
Patsy's
older
sister,
who
was
my
babysitter,
died
of
Hodgkin's
disease,
rather
than
crying
or
talking
about
the
tragedy,
I
wrote
a
story
about
it.
When
the
beautiful
Victorian
mansion
next
door
to
us
was
thoughtlessly
tom
down
by
its
new
owner,
in
order
to
build
a
modem
monstrosity
in
its
place,
rather
than
hide
my
anger,
I
wrote
a
story
about
his
disturbing
act,
and
it
was
published
in
a
local
newspaper.
I
also
found
it
very
easy
to
express
my
feelings
in
letters
.
When
my
father
and
I
would
argue
we
would
write
letters
to
each
other,
rather
than
yell
at
one
another.
When
I
was
upset
with
my
friends
or
boyfriend
I
would
again
write
all
my
feelings
in
a
letter
and
sometimes
give
it
to
them,
or
other
times,
I
would
just
keep
it
for
myself.
I
have
never
thrown
away
anything
that
I
have
written.
Eventually
I
was
weaned
off
of
my
dependence
on
my
father's
academic
help.
By
my
senior
year
in
high
school
there
were
no
more
English
classes
left
for
me
to
take
because
I
had
already
completed
AP
English
as
a
junior.
I
therefore
decided
to
register
for
an
evening
sophomore
English
literature
class
at
our
local
community
college.
It
was
very
similar
to
Lafayeytte's
English
210.
Ironically,
the
person
who
had
taught
me
for
the
past
seventeen
years
at
home
happened
to
be
the
only
professor
who
taught
that
particular
class
at
night.
Therefore,
not
only
was
I
the
only
high
school
senior
in
a
class
of
mainly
adults,
but
the
professor
was
also
my
Daddy,
who
had
no
problem
pointing
that
out
to
the
class
on
the
very
first
night!
Anyway,
in
this
class,
reality
struck.
Dad
showed
no
mercy.
He
would
not
even
write
the
first
sentence
of
my
papers,
let
alone
the
introduction
!
He
claimed
it
would
be
an
unfair
advantage
(as
if
it
weren't
that
all
along
in
my
other
classes!).
But
I
guess
he
was
right.
So
I
wrote
my
own
papers
without
any
help
except
from
my
mother,
a
high
school
English
teacher,
who
would
proof
read
for
errors.
I
was
very
happy
when
I
completed
the
course
on
my
own
and
received
a
B+.
I
felt
I
was
ready
for
even
more
challenging
college
courses.
(I
was
wrong!)
Meanwhile,
during
my
senior
year
in
high
school
all
of
my
friends
were
writing
college
essays
and
I
was
always
asked
to
help.
Flattered
by
their
confidence
in
me
as
a
writer,
I
spent
hours
with
many
of
my
friends
writing,
proof
reading,
and
helping
them
with
their
essays.
This
helping
expanded
to
their
school
work
too,
so
I
guess
that
in
my
senior
year
I
was
a
little
like
a
WA
for
my
friends.
I
loved
doing
it
because
my
career
goal
is
teaching
and
I
knew
that
this
was
excellent
experience.
After
graduating
from
high
school
I
entered
Lafayette
as
a
freshman.
I
don't
know
why,
but
I
was
not
expecting
college
to
be
difficult.
This
belief
was
shattered
when
I
walked
into
my
First
Year
Seminar
and
was
given
a
twenty-five
page
syllabus
that
explained
the
writing
requirements
of
the
class
which
included
two,
twenty
page
papers
as
well
as
a
weekly
three
to
four
page
journal
on
the
readings.
I
was
terrified.
The
longest
paper
I
had
ever
written
was
only
seven
pages
and
I
had
considered
it
a
tremendous
accomplishment.
Shocked
by
the
enormous
amount
of
work
that
I
was
expected
to
be
able
to
complete,
I
was
basically
ready
to
drop
out
of
school
and
come
home.
Although
I
was
not
afraid
that
my
writing
level
was
not
equal
to
that
of
my
peers
at
Lafayette,
I
just
did
not
think
that
there
was
any
way
I
could
find
the
time
to
write
so
many
pages.
Meeting
with
my
WA
for
the
first
time
was
an
interesting
experience.
I
have
to
admit
that
at
first
I
was
a
little
annoyed
by
the
concept
of
having
a
WA.
I
am
still
a
procrastinator
and
I
had
no
interest
in
writing
a
paper
before
it
was
due
just
so
another
student
could
read
it.
I
also
did
not
think
that
the
WA
would
understand
my
writing
style,
nor
did
I
feel
that
I
needed
help
or
advice
on
the
paper
in
the
first
place.
Reluctantly
I
went
to
my
meeting
with
the
first
eight
pages
of
my
twenty
page
paper
completed
and
an
outline
for
the
rest.
I
left
the
meeting
feeling
excited
about
finishing
the
rest
of
my
paper.
My
WA
gave
me
great
advice
for
my
conclusion,
helped
me
to
clear
up
any
ambiguities
in
my
concepts,
and
lessened
my
anxiety
about
having
to
write
a
twenty
page
paper.
My
particular
First
Year
Seminar
was
said
to
be
one
of
the
more
challenging
ones
offered,
but
in
retrospect,
the
effort
that
I
made
to
meet
it
proved
beneficial
to
my
ability
to
handle
college
level
writing.
This
accomplishment
was
also
enhanced
by
my
WA,
and
as
a
result
of
that
first
meeting
with
her,
I
was
inspired
to
strive
for
the
position
of
a
WA
myself.
During
the
past
three
years
at
Lafayette,
my
writing
has
developed
even
more.
I
have
strayed
slightly
from
my
father's
style
since
I
don't
have
his
constant
influence,
and
I
have
created
more
of
my
own
style.
I
have
learned
not
to
dread
writing
long
papers,
but
rather
to
view
them
as
a
challenge
that
can
be
enjoyable.
Writing
a
four
page
paper,
previously
an
enormous
task
for
me
in
high
school,
is
now
a
pleasurable
way
for
me
to
spend
a
couple
of
creative
hours.
Although
my
grades
on
papers
at
Lafayette
have
ranged
from
as
low
as
a
C+
to
as
high
as
an
A,
I
feel
that
I
have
learned
a
great
deal
about
writing
and
the
organization
of
academic
research
papers,
and
I
have
learned
that
they,
too,
can
present
an
interesting
challenge.
Still
I
prefer
creative
writing,
and
I
most
enjoy
writing
my
feelings
and
thoughts
for
myself.
Perhaps
someday
I
will
dig
out
of
my
files
my
old
stories
from
sixth
grade,
revise
them
in
light
of
what
I
know
now,
and
possibly
even
get
them
published
in
a
collection
of
children's
literature.
For
the
time
being,
however,
I
am
most
looking
forward
to
the
next
step
of
my
writing
experience,
namely
that
of
being
a
WA,
and
inspiring
others
as
my
WA
inspired
me
PS.
My
father
did
not
write
this
paper.
Not
even
the
very
first
sentence!
