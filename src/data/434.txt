August,
2004
The
pencil
felt
funny
in
my
hand.
My
sweaty
stubby
fingers
felt
awkward
with
the
sharpened
lead
protruding
from
my
toddlerOs
fist.
As
I
dragged
the
charcoal
stranger
across
the
paper
I
made
unsteady
linear
scratches.
Eventually
these
scratches
graduated
to
scribbles.
Soon
my
mother
bought
me
strange
coloring
books.
The
coloring
book
pictures
would
alternate
with
strange
pages
covered
in
lines
and
dotted
lines.
I
learned
my
ABCOs.
My
pencil
learned
to
create
shaky
letters.
After
a
while,
my
ABCOs
could
spell
small
simple
words.
Soon
my
words
made
sentences.
Eventually
my
sentences
reflected
my
thoughts.
It
wasnOt
easy
learning
the
ABCOs.
It
was
even
more
frustrating
to
learn
how
letters
fit
together,
and
subsequently
became
more
and
more
complex.
Soon
as
you
understood
what
one
word
meant,
there
was
little
time
to
enjoy
the
accomplishment
seeing
as
hundreds
more
were
awaiting
the
same
task.
I
learned
to
write
relatively
quickly
though.
I
found
words
fascinating.
Reading
childrenOs
books
and
being
read
to
could
entertain
me
for
hours.
Some
of
it
must
have
come
naturally
I
guess.
Throughout
elementary
school
reading
and
writing
were
fun
and
exciting.
Writing
was
an
expression
of
imagination.
All
little
kids
thrive
when
depending
on
small
doses
of
imagination
and
creativity.
Writing
was
that
creative
outlet
for
me
at
a
young
age.
Of
course,
eventually
writing
became
somewhat
more
practical.
Soon
book
reports
were
assigned.
Writing
was
used
to
convey
the
facts
and
I
learned
to
regurgitate
what
I
was
learning
in
written
form.
Drudgery
inevitably
sucked
some
of
the
life
and
creativity
out
of
my
writing.
While
I
was
younger
though,
the
eventual
accomplishment
of
writing
wasnOt
so
seemingly
complex.
It
wasnOt
until
I
got
to
high
school
that
writing
began
to
occasionally
frustrate
me.
High
school
is
where
IOm
convinced
I
got
my
first
few
glimpses
at
the
diminishing
mysteries
of
writing.
I
say
this
because
up
until
high
school,
writing
wasnOt
very
structured.
Most
of
the
time
my
teachers
wanted
us
to
tell
stories
or
creatively
describe
an
apple.
I
remember
one
assignment
where
I
had
to
describe
an
object
with
as
many
adjectives
as
I
could.
My
teachers,
as
well
as
my
parents,
had
wanted
reading
and
writing
to
be
fun.
They
wanted
the
assignments
to
interest
you
so
that
you
would
enjoy
doing
them
to
the
best
of
your
ability.
I
guess
sometimes
they
even
tried
to
sell
them
to
you,
by
announcing
the
best
of
the
classesO
work
would
be
mounted
on
pretty
pieces
of
construction
paper
to
adorn
the
halls
and
announce
your
creativity.
Writing
had
never
occurred
to
me
as
something
that
wasnOt
legitimately
fun
up
until
this
point.
It
was
an
extension
of
that
Nmagic
carpet
rideO,
so
mysterious
and
thrilling.
But
high
school
taught
me
writing
structure
and
challenged
my
expression
of
creativity.
It
prodded
me
to
consider
the
difference
between
good
writing
and
bad
writing,
and
identify
that
category
with
which
my
writing
would
align
itself.
Throughout
high
school,
one
thing
I
was
lucky
to
experience
was
a
wealth
of
good
English
teachers,
who
taught
me
to
take
my
love
of
reading
and
develop
it
further.
But
after
all
that
reading,
we
would
be
forced
to
reflect.
Our
reflections
would
be
captured
on
paper.
I
learned
that
a
well-developed
essay
was
an
important
skill
to
have.
If
nothing
else,
it
helped
you
learn
to
express
yourself
better.
Writing
came
somewhat
naturally
to
me.
I
never
really
dreaded
the
research
papers
or
endless
essays.
Once
you
learned
the
general
framework,
I
felt
the
information
flowed
so
much
easier.
We
learned
about
the
Nfive
paragraph
essayO
and
developed
theses
and
central
ideas.
I
checked
my
papers
for
main
ideas
and
topic
sentences.
I
worked
hard
to
adhere
to
the
structure
my
teachers
would
teach
us.
I
soon
learned
that
structure
was
sometimes
more
important
than
the
idea
behind
it.
I
remember
one
instance
in
my
Advanced
Placement
English
class
where
I
wrote
a
paper
about
cell
phones
or
something
else
similarly
trivial
in
nature.
I
could
have
cared
less
about
the
topic.
The
only
way
I
got
through
that
assignment
was
by
organizing
each
bit
of
information
into
my
teacherOs
ideal
essay
template.
Two
weeks
later
I
got
the
essay
back
with
an
NAO
written
in
red
marker
at
the
top
of
the
first
page.
Later
in
the
course
I
wrote
an
essay
on
women
employees
in
our
school
district.
The
topic
interested
me.
I
had
collected
a
good
deal
of
information
and
I
was
ready
to
defend
my
thesis
with
statistics
and
a
clear
voice.
The
paper
flowed
so
easily.
I
was
so
sure
IOd
do
well.
My
teacher
hated
it.
She
said
my
passion
was
clear,
but
I
lacked
important
structures
embedded
in
every
good
five
paragraph
essay.
I
rewrote
the
paper
to
fit
her
guidelines
and
handed
it
in
the
next
day.
I
didnOt
like
my
revision,
but
I
knew
she
would.
It
had
the
correct
amount
of
paragraphs,
each
containing
a
topic
sentence,
which
related
to
my
thesis.
It
imitated
structural
perfection.
Still
the
fun
had
been
stolen
from
my
academic
writing.
I
quickly
learned
to
substitute
structure
for
really
caring.
Slowly
I
learned
to
hate
writing
just
like
everybody
else.
The
more
writing,
the
more
I
feared
the
assignment.
My
balding
stout
professor
walked
in
the
door,
announced
his
Ivy
League
Degree
and
set
us
straight
from
day
one.
Good
grades
in
this
class
were
not
won
by
washing
chalkboards
or
additional
interest.
Good
grades
were
given
to
students
who
did
what
the
class
was
created
to
teach.
Good
grades
were
given
to
those
who
were
good
writers.
Good
writers
write,
rewrite,
and
rewrite
what
they
have
already
written
again.
Up
until
this
point,
my
education
had
always
been
integrated
and
somewhat
founded
upon
a
studentOs
ability
to
write.
But
this
was
my
first
direct
experience
with
outwardly
trying
to
become
a
better
writer.
I
knew
how
to
read
the
books
and
regurgitate
the
information
in
a
legible
paper,
but
never
had
I
taken
a
class
where
the
sole
intention
was
improved
writing.
But
perhaps
the
most
baffling
part
for
me
was
not
the
nature
of
the
class,
but
rather
the
nature
of
the
professor.
This
professor
would
not
and
could
not
be
won
over
with
charm
and
eager
smiles.
This
class
was
about
writing
and
only
writing.
I
was
scared.
For
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
I
doubted
my
literacy
abilities.
The
second
writing
intensive
course
I
enrolled
myself
in,
was
my
College
Writing
class.
NLiteracy
and
Social
JusticeO
was
the
topic
of
the
course,
and
was
followed
by
a
persuasive
blurb
on
the
handout
describing
this
prerequisite
for
graduation.
I
remember
taking
a
shower
for
the
first
day
of
class.
I
wanted
to
be
awake
and
clean,
and
get
a
fresh
new
start
on
the
semester.
I
felt
after
completing
my
First
Year
Seminar
I
had
to
prove
in
some
classroom
at
Lafayette
College
that
I
was
a
good
writer.
Once
again,
my
first
impression
of
my
professor
threw
me
off.
IOm
sitting
in
this
corner
classroom
of
Pardee
Hall.
While
waiting
for
the
professor,
I
hide
my
hands
in
the
sleeves
of
my
sweater
to
fight
off
the
January
chill.
Here
she
comes,
This
short,
chipper
woman
walks
into
the
classroom,
drops
her
stack
of
handouts,
and
breaks
into
a
friendly
grin.
IOm
somewhat
eased.
She
changes
the
seating
arrangement
so
we
are
more
suited
for
discussion
and
peer
interaction.
While
the
class
drudgingly
pushes
the
tables
to
resemble
a
rectangle,
I
reflect
on
why
I
am
in
this
class.
Yes,
it
is
a
prerequisite
for
graduation,
but
this
class
is
entitled
NLiteracy
and
Social
JusticeO.
My
future
ambitions
for
law
school
have
seduced
me
to
consider
taking
this
class
as
my
college
writing
requirement.
After
all,
itOs
about
justice,
right?
We
settle
into
our
seats.
She
begins
to
address
the
class.
.
NThe
focus
of
this
course
will
be
on
your
writing
and
the
writing
of
your
peers.
Some
days
we
will
hold
class
and
our
topic
of
discussion
will
be
one
of
your
papers.
I
realize
sharing
your
personal
writing
is
not
always
comfortable,
but
that
is
how
you
get
better.
So
get
ready
to
share.
Get
ready
to
spend
2
or
3
hours
a
week
just
sitting
and
writing.
You
must
learn
to
write,
then
revise,
then
read,
then
revise
again.
You
will
learn
writing
is
a
very
long
process,
and
it
is
never
perfect.
But
you
will
learn
to
write
better,
even
if
it
is
for
the
sole
reason
that
you
will
write
more
than
you
are
used
to.O
I
think,
NOh
boy.
What
did
I
get
myself
into
this
time?
This
crazy
lady
wants
me
to
sit
in
the
library
in
my
free
time
and
write,
write,
write.
IOm
My
dismal
outlook
disappeared
soon
enough.
I
didnOt
really
think
you
could
NlearnO
to
write
better.
As
far
as
I
saw,
writing
wasnOt
really
a
skill
you
could
teach.
I
mean,
yes
I
had
been
taught
the
alphabet
and
numerous
vocabulary
words,
which
enabled
me
to
write.
But
how
do
you
teach
someone
to
put
them
together
to
form
a
well-written
sample
of
work?
But
essay
after
essay,
and
in
class
writing
after
narrative,
I
learned
that
the
more
you
wrote,
the
easier
it
came.
The
easier
it
came
to
you,
the
more
potential
your
writing
had.
When
your
writing
has
positive
potential,
the
harder
revision
becomes.
Yet
IOm
learning.
IOm
learning
writing
is
a
process.
It
is
a
very
long
process
and
also
has
its
moments
of
extreme
tediousness,
but
it
is
important.
It
is
important
because
it
is
a
universal
tool
of
expression,
and
lends
permanence
to
our
thoughts.
It
is
important
because
we
depend
on
it
for
numerous
tasks.
But
most
of
all,
it
is
important
because
it
helps
generate
thoughts
into
a
well-organized
process
if
done
right.
It
is
a
part
of
what
makes
us
better,
and
what
potential
we
posess.
College
is
slowly
forcing
me
to
cope
with
my
fear
of
revision,
though
it
still
manages
to
occasionally
rear
its
head
as
my
tragic
academic
flaw.
Unfortunately
my
flaw
is
one
of
the
most
important
tools
for
a
good
writer.
Throughout
both
my
writing
intensive
courses
my
professors
repeatedly
hand
the
class
an
assignment
and
we
turn
it
in.
No
sweat.
Then
they
pass
it
back.
NRevise
and
expand,
due
next
week.O
Suddenly
the
Psycho
theme
begins
to
play
in
the
back
of
my
head.
My
first
step
in
coping
with
revision
had
to
be
the
acceptance
of
that
dreaded
bumpy
letter
NBO.
Up
until
college
I
had
never
received
a
NBO.
Sure
I
received
assignments
through
out
my
earlier
education
with
a
letter
other
than
NAO
on
it,
but
never
on
a
report
card.
I
was
so
scared
of
that
stupid
letter.
Assignment
after
assignment
in
my
FYS,
I
saw
that
my
least
favorite
letter
appear
and
reappear.
I
didnOt
know
what
to
do.
I
was
discouraged.
I
would
do
well
on
my
first
paper,
then
worse
on
the
second
draft.
I
couldnOt
grasp
this
concept
it
didnOt
make
sense
to
me.
Revision
became
my
biggest
academic
fear,
and
when
academics
are
what
you
are
good
at,
this
is
no
small
problem.
Revision
simply
does
not
disappear
in
college.
College
is
not
about
producing
one
well-written
draft.
Professors
insist
on
issuing
draft
after
draft,
in
hopes
that
somewhere
down
the
road
you
will
really
strike
gold.
After
sitting
down
to
revise
countless
papers
this
past
year,
I
think
I
might
know
why.
When
you
write
something,
you
learn
whatever
topic
is
you
are
writing
about
at
a
level
of
absorption
that
is
impossible
to
imitate
through
any
other
means.
Just
like
when
I
read
over
words
in
the
dictionary
time
after
time,
when
you
write
your
ideas
down
you
NclaimO
your
knowledge.
Not
only
do
you
claim
your
knowledge,
but
you
are
forced
to
interpret
your
knowledge
at
a
level
impossible
to
achieve
by
any
other
means.
When
you
write
something
well,
and
type
your
name
in
MLA
format
at
the
left
corner
of
the
page,
it
is
yours.
It
is
your
knowledge,
your
interpretation,
your
creation.
The
reason
revising
becomes
so
important
is
that
your
interpretation
of
your
own
knowledge
is
enhanced
draft
after
draft.
Your
Nreflective
thinkingO
becomes
clearer
and
better
expressed.
Your
knowledge
becomes
thorough.
Slowly,
but
surely
I
am
seeing
the
light
of
this
revision
business.
This
view
of
writing
has
developed
throughout
my
college
writing
class.
In
one
of
our
readings
I
found
this
quote,
NOne
can
think
effectively
only
when
one
is
willing
to
endure
suspense
and
to
undergo
the
trouble
of
searching,O
by
John
Dewey.
I
think
this
statement
captures
both
the
hassle
revising
your
work
can
be,
but
also
the
rewarding
outcome
of
truly
understanding
something.
College
has
taught
me
that
the
first
draft
should
definitely
not
be
your
last.
If
your
first
draft
is
good,
thatOs
awesome,
but
it
means
your
second
draft
can
be
even
better.
My
college
writing
experience
can
be
defined
mostly
through
my
first-year
seminar
experience.
I
walked
in
a
pretty
confident
writer.
I
walked
out
realizing
I
had
a
lot
of
work
ahead
of
me.
Throughout
my
FYS
we
worked
on
the
general
writing
skills.
Revising,
researching,
peer
reviewing
were
all
stressed
concepts.
Yet
the
thing
I
learned
the
most
in
that
class
is
that
writing
cannot
be
taught
within
three
jam-packed
months.
There
are
too
many
style
intricacies
and
discoveries
about
your
own
writing
ability
that
you
must
make
in
order
to
be
the
best
writer
you
can.
So
after
a
couple
of
harsh
reviews
from
my
professors
I
finally
surrendered
myself
to
the
idea
that
my
written
literacy
has
not
come
full
circle
yet,
and
probably
never
will.
I
still
have
much
to
learn,
and
not
only
in
the
form
of
straightforward
fact
knowledge,
but
in
the
idea
that
I
cannot
conceivably
have
done
my
best
work
until
I
have
invested
hours
and
hours
of
quality
time
into
it.
Although
that
idea
makes
me
realize
I
have
a
lot
of
work
ahead
of
me,
it
also
makes
me
realize
that
I
am
here
for
a
very
good
reason.
I
am
here
to
take
my
strengths
and
make
them
stronger,
and
to
become
the
most
literate
of
a
person
as
I
can
be.
I
am
here
to
realize
that
this
literate
journey
doesnOt
end
when
I
have
my
Lafayette
diploma
in
hand.
ThereOs
always
something
new
to
master.
Whether
it
be
technique,
style,
or
just
your
story
in
general,
your
writing
can
always
suffer
some
improvement.
Good
writers
sometimes
simply
have
better
writing
stamina.
