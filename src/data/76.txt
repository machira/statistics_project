The
earliest
I
remember
myself
writing
was
when
I
was
about
four
and
a
half
years
old.
My
mom
and
I
were
on
vacation
at
the
Black
Sea
and
I
wrote
postcards
to
all
our
friends
and
relatives.
I
remember
being
really
proud
of
myself.
I
always
wanted
to
be
a
grown-up
and
being
able
to
write
really
made
me
feel
mature
even
though
I
could
only
print.
In
first
grade,
at
six
years
of
age,
I
learned
how
to
write
script.
The
grown-up
look
of
my
writing
gave
me
confidence
and
I
felt
ready
to
tackle
any
writing
assignment.
The
earliest
written
works
I
was
asked
to
produce
were
simple
compositions
-
Describe
your
favorite
season,
your
pet,
your
room,
etc.
We
had
to
write
a
first
draft
on
which
we
were
allowed
to
cross
words
off,
to
add
and
make
corrections,
but
we
were
required
to
submit
only
the
final
draft
which
was
supposed
to
look
impeccable.
Towards
the
end
of
second
grade
the
structure
of
a
simple
composition
(introduction,
exposition,
conclusion)
was
explained
to
us
and
we
had
to
make
sure
that
our
compositions
fit
into
this
framework.
In
third
grade
the
idea
of
an
outline
was
presented
and
we
had
to
submit
an
outline
along
with
every
composition
we
wrote.
Still,
being
a
good
writer
at
that
level
meant
for
the
most
part
writing
neat
and
making
no
spelling
errors.
As
far
as
I
can
remember
my
compositions
were
always
on
the
Great
Work
board,
so
I
started
my
writing
career
with
the
belief
that
I
wrote
well.
School,
however,
was
not
the
only
influential
force
on
my
writing.
My
mom
was
took
it
upon
herself
to
create
challenges
for
me.
She
continued
to
encourage
me
to
read
books
because,
according
to
her,
exposure
to
good
writing
greatly
contributed
to
one's
writing
abilities.
She
also
asked
me
to
write
a
page
about
every
book
I
had
read
and
then
we
discussed
what
I
had
written.
In
addition,
about
twice
a
week
she
would
read
me
a
two
paragraph
text
and
I
had
to
rewrite
it
in
my
own
words,
without
using
direct
speech.
I
don't
remember
being
too
fond
of
this
exercise,
but
I
was
still
at
the
age
where
Mommy
knew
everything,
so
I
did
it
without
arguing.
My
development
as
a
writer
during
the
first
sixteen
years
of
my
life
occurred
in
a
different
cultural
and
linguistic
setting.
I
was
born
and
grew
up
in
Bulgaria.
There
extensive
writing
is
only
done
for
Literature
classes
and
for
high
school
History
classes.
Thus,
almost
everything
I
wrote
pertained
to
literature.
From
fourth
to
sixth
grade,
we
had
big
in-class
writing
assignments
for
our
literature
class
about
once
a
month.
We
usually
answered
a
question
about
something
we
had
read
during
the
past
month.
As
we
got
older,
the
questions
became
more
analytical
than
factual
-
for
example
what
we
thought
the
author's
message
was,
what
kind
of
impression
the
work
left
on
us,
what
was
the
importance
of
one
of
the
characters.
I
enjoyed
thinking
and
writing
about
what
I
had
read,
so
I
had
no
problem
with
the
assignments.
According
to
the
teacher,
everything
I
wrote
was
excellent.
According
to
my
mom,
I
was
a
good
writer,
but
the
teacher
wasn't
demanding
enough.
In
seventh
grade
I
decided
to
apply
to
the
English
Language
School
in
Plovdiv
(the
second
biggest
city
in
Bulgaria).
The
entrance
exams
were
in
Mathematics
and
Literature.
Competition
was
rigorous,
so
if
you
had
any
serious
intentions,
you
had
to
get
a
tutor
in
both
Literature
and
Math.
Being
the
offspring
of
a
physicist
and
an
engineer
I
didn't
need
a
Math
tutor,
but
I
knew
that
as
far
as
writing
went,
the
excellent
grades
I
got
in
school
were
not
good
enough.
So
I
started
taking
lessons
from
Mr.
Petrov.
Looking
back
on
my
Mr.
Petrov
times
I
know
that
if
I
had
to
name
the
person
who
contributed
the
most
to
my
progress
as
a
writer,
it
would
be
him.
The
first
literary
analysis
I
had
to
write
for
him
was
on
the
first
chapter
of
a
famous
Bulgarian
novel.
I
thought
it
was
the
best
piece
of
writing
I
ever
produced.
He
thought
that
it
showed
potential.
I
had
to
expand
and
rewrite
that
same
analysis
about
four
times
until
he
liked
it.
I
realized
that
writing
was
not
a
breeze
no
matter
how
talented
you
were.
It
involved
a
lot
of
hard
work
and
it
demanded
everything
of
you.
Once
I
had
come
to
that
realization,
I
gave
writing
my
whole
self
and
I
felt
I
was
a
better
writer
already.
Mr.
Petrov
taught
me
to
think
about
my
writing,
to
make
it
as
clear,
expressive,
and
powerful
as
possible,
and
to
realize
that
a
piece
of
writing
is
never
finished.
Writing
was
no
longer
an
assignment,
it
was
a
hidden
power.
Mr.
Petrov
had
made
me
aware
of
it.
I
also
got
into
the
school
I
wanted.
My
first
grade
on
a
writing
assignment
in
my
new
school
was
a
5
(equivalent
to
a
B).
I
had
never
gotten
a
5
in
writing
ever,
so
this
was
quite
a
shocking
experience.
The
reason
it
was
a
5
instead
of
a
6
was
my
recklessness.
My
thesis
was
a
bit
unclear
and
my
transitions
were
horrible
-mistakes
I
normally
never
made.
I
hadn't
taken
the
assignment
as
seriously
as
I
should
have.
I
learned
a
valuable
lesson
-
being
an
excellent
writer
should
not
be
taken
for
granted.
At
this
point
we
were
required
to
produce
fairly
sophisticated
pieces
of
writing.
It
is
hard
to
translate
the
genres'
names
from
Bulgarian
to
English,
but
we
were
essentially
writing
argument
papers
and
literary
analyses.
On
occasion,
we
were
asked
to
write
essays
on
topics,
unrelated
to
literature.
They
were
my
favorite
assignments
and
they
were
always
very
strong
and
persuasive.
This
is
when
I
realized
why
I
loved
writing.
It
gave
me
a
way
to
express
my
thoughts
and
opinions
and
make
them
permanent.
Just
as
I
loved
to
share
my
opinions,
I
loved
to
share
my
writing.
I
never
felt
self-conscious
about
it.
Most
of
my
family
and
friends
read
it.
I
listened
carefully
to
every
comment
or
criticism,
and
I
acted
upon
what
I
thought
was
reasonable.
In
tenth
grade
I
came
to
the
United
States.
I
had
to
transpose
all
the
skills
I
had
acquired
onto
a
different
linguistic
plane.
My
English
was
excellent
by
then,
but
it
wasn't
fully
polished.
My
writing
was
well-structured,
but
wordy.
I
had
to
work
hard
in
order
to
be
able
to
express
myself
as
well
in
English
as
I
did
in
Bulgarian.
I
improved
extremely
fast
because
of
my
English
teacher
Mrs.
Sarli.
She
was
a
tough
grader.
Every
essay
that
I
worked
hard
on
and
thought
deserved
an
A
received
an
A-.
You
can
do
better
,
Mrs.
Sarli
kept
saying.
My
final
A
average
in
English
was
the
hardest
A
I
have
ever
received,
but
I
really
grew
as
a
writer.
The
same
year
I
developed
a
new
passion
-
letter-writing.
I
was
away
from
my
family,
phone
calls
were
very
expensive,
and
letters
proved
to
be
a
great
source
of
communication.
I
wrote
to
my
family
at
least
once
a
week.
I
wrote
to
tell
them
how
my
week
was,
I
wrote
when
I
was
happy,
I
wrote
when
I
was
sad,
I
wrote
just
to
tell
my
parents
that
I
missed
them.
I
wrote
to
my
friends
very
often
too.
Writing
stopped
being
a
school-related
activity.
It
was
a
way
to
be
close
to
the
people
I
loved
who
were
5000
miles
away.
It
replaced
talking,
it
meant
spelling
out
my
joys
and
sorrows,
my
pleasures
and
pains,
my
defeats
and
triumphs.
This
change
in
attitude
also
gave
a
new
flair
to
my
writing.
Both
family
and
friends
have
told
me
that
certain
letters
of
mine
were
beautiful
,
that
they
were
like
pieces
of
literature.
My
epistolary
expression,
however,
reached
its
pinnacle
when
I
fell
in
love.
I
never
knew
I
could
write
that
way.
In
my
love
letters
words
and
feelings
became
one
-
something
I
had
never
experienced
before.
The
next
two
years
of
high
school
took
my
writing
to
new
heights.
I
was
a
part
of
the
International
Baccalaureate
Program
which
places
a
big
emphasis
on
writing.
We
wrote
at
least
two
essays
a
week
in
English
class,
five
essays
a
month
in
History
class,
and
extensive
lab
reports
for
our
Chemistry
class.
We
also
wrote
two
papers
in
English
and
two
papers
in
History
to
be
submitted
for
external
evaluation
at
the
Headquarters
of
the
program
in
Geneva.
Another
program
requirement
was
a
5
000-word
paper
on
any
topic
we
chose.
Needless
to
say,
we
wrote
a
lot.
In
addition,
our
teachers
graded
us
according
to
college
standards,
which
posed
an
even
bigger
challenge.
The
program
involved
indeed,
an
enormous
amount
of
work,
but
by
the
time
I
graduated
from
high
school,
I
felt
I
was
extremely
well
prepared
for
college.
My
writing
was
clear,
well-organized
and
powerful.
I
believed
that
if
I
survived
the
International
Baccalaureate
Program
I
could
survive
anything.
My
very
first
writing
assignment
at
Lafayette
was
for
my
First
Year
Seminar.
Even
though
I
was
confident
about
my
writing,
I
was
a
bit
anxious
when
I
went
to
pick
up
my
graded
paper.
With
my
heart
pounding,
I
looked
at
the
last
page.
Solid
job
,
it
said,
followed
by
an
A.
I
sighed
with
relief.
My
self-confidence
was
backed
by
results.
It
also
inspired
me.
I
decided
not
to
submit
a
paper
I
wasn't
proud
of,
or
as
I
put
it
simply
I
don't
hand
in
garbage.
What
I
really
enjoyed
about
writing
for
my
FYS
was
working
with
my
Writing
Associate.
I
love
to
bounce
my
writing
off
somebody,
and
I
was
happy
that
the
college
was
actually
providing
that
somebody
for
me.
I
had
never
had
to
talk
about
my
writing
before
and
I
was
amazed
at
how
much
it
helped
my
ability
to
focus
on
my
difficulties
and
to
address
them.
My
biggest
writing
challenge
here
were
the
five
short
(6
page)
papers
for
my
Introduction
to
International
Politics
class.
They
were
based
on
assigned
readings
and
were
essentially,
analytical
papers.
Writing
papers
for
Government
was
different
than
writing
papers
for
English,
and
mastering
that
ability
was
a
challenge.
I
consider
being
selected
for
a
WA
my
most
important
achievement
as
a
writer.
It
meant
not
only
mastery
a
foreign
language,
but
also
that
my
writing
skills
can
help
other
writers.
Looking
back
on
my
writing
experiences,
I
consider
myself
fortunate.
Having
to
master
writing
in
two
very
different
languages
has
made
me
realize
and
appreciate
the
power
of
writing.
I
believe
I
have
taken
full
advantage
of
every
opportunity
I
had
to
become
a
better
writer
and
to
explore
new
dimensions
of
writing.
I
also
realize
that
even
though
I
have
been
writing
for
sixteen
years,
my
journey
as
a
writer
has
just
started.
