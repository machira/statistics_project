Literacy
Narrative
I
think
it
might
have
been
a
leopard,
but
its
hard
to
remember
what
kind
of
cat
adorned
the
written
description
I
provided
as
part
of
a
fourth
grade
assignment.
I
drew
the
cat
with
crayons
and
then
cut
it
out
so
that
the
white
space
no
longer
invaded
on
the
cat.
Then
I
wrote
down
a
description
of
the
beast
on
yellow
lined
paper
and
stapled
it
to
the
cat.
In
this
early
assignment,
there
was
the
combination
of
words
and
text
that
has
not
been
so
prevalent
since
then.
It
was
also
an
assignment
with
no
citing
of
sources
and
probably
paraphrases
extremely
similar
to
the
original
wordings.
My
teacher
had
introduced
research
to
me,
though.
This
early
assignment
would
pave
the
way
for
many
more
research
papers
and
perhaps
probably
was
not
the
first
paper
either.
My
writing
entered
a
new
phase
near
the
end
of
middle
school;
I
started
writing
short
stories
and
comic
strips.
Some
of
the
earlier
ones
I
wrote
were
influenced
by
comic
books
and
various
books
that
I
had
read,
with
one
such
story
involving
Batman.
I
have
been
a
voracious
reader,
so
my
love
of
reading
spilled
over
into
the
joy
found
from
writing.
I
was
also
pushed
on
by
other
people
I
knew.
One
of
my
friends
and
I
put
together
some
radio
plays
and
stories
that
we
taped.
During
this
time,
I
was
writing
at
home
as
well.
Sometimes
the
stories
I
wrote
were
about
the
people
I
knew
or
a
reaction
to
something
my
friend
had
written.
An
irony
and
sense
of
humor
filled
those
stories
and
that
humor
has
continued
to
be
part
of
my
creative
writing.
In
addition
to
writing
the
stories,
I
also
recorded
readings
of
some
of
them.
This
practice
connected
me
to
the
oral
tradition,
one
that
continues
today.
Though
the
research
paper
reared
its
head
several
times,
some
of
the
more
vivid
memories
come
from
ninth
grade
geology.
One
of
the
research
papers
was
on
the
sun
and
another
on
the
geography
of
China.
Each
paper
resulted
from
library
research,
often
times
with
the
information
coming
out
of
various
encyclopedias.
One
of
the
most
striking
elements
about
these
papers
was
that
the
outline
was
done
after
the
paper.
I
would
write
the
paper,
determine
its
structure,
and
then
write
the
outline.
The
papers
were
also
hand
written
with
the
final
copies
typed.
These
papers
were
at
the
verge
of
a
change
in
my
writing.
The
pencil
and
paper
still
ruled
my
writing
and
the
encyclopedia
provided
the
valuable
information
for
the
school
reports.
The
paradigms
soon
changed.
During
the
summer
before
my
sophomore
year,
my
family
bought
a
computer.
This
one
purchase
ultimately
changed
my
writing
in
many
ways.
The
flexibility
of
editing
a
written
document
allowed
me
to
extensively
edit
my
work
and
test
out
sentences
that
I
though
might
fit
well.
Changes
were
instantaneous
unlike
with
pencil
and
paper
where
changes
were
often
messy
or
did
not
fit
on
the
page.
The
type
written
pages
looked
a
lot
better
than
my
handwritten
ones,
especially
since
I
had
sloppy
penmanship.
I
found
that
the
difference
in
appearance,
although
superficial
and
not
necessarily
related
to
the
text,
could
have
a
major
effect
on
how
others
viewed
the
document.
People
treated
a
type
written
document
more
seriously
than
a
handwritten
one.
Not
only
did
I
type
my
essays
but
I
began
to
write
short
stories
with
the
computer.
I
liked
the
feature
of
being
able
to
print
out
copies
of
the
document
whenever
you
wanted
and
how
easily
a
mistake
could
be
edited
in
the
file.
One
of
the
classes
where
the
new
computer
was
put
to
weekly
use
was
my
tenth
grade
world
history
class.
As
the
old
paradigm
of
using
pencil
and
paper
had
ended
so
did
the
one
of
using
encyclopedias
as
primary
sources.
Each
week
we
wrote
an
assigned
biography
of
one
of
the
people
we
were
studying
at
the
time.
The
teacher
would
not
let
us
use
encyclopedias
as
our
main
source.
This
stipulation
forced
me
to
go
and
find
more
detailed
information
from
sources
such
as
Plutarch's
Lives.
The
teacher
also
wanted
us
to
look
beyond
the
standard
history
and
try
to
determine
where
their
fame
came
from
and
how
they
fit
into
the
big
picture.
What
did
they
personally
represent
and
how
did
they
represent
their
time?
This
writing
style
was
much
more
mature
than
that
done
in
my
geology
class
the
previous
year.
We
analyzed
history
using
information
sometimes
from
translations
of
primary
sources
and
not
just
the
secondary
sources
of
encyclopedias.
Eleventh
grade
English
provided
the
venue
for
my
temporary
abstinence
from
the
use
of
the
verb
to
be.
My
English
teacher
disliked
the
verb
to
be
and
preferred
that
we
use
the
active
voice.
Usage
of
the
verb
to
be
could
dramatically
lower
ones
grade
on
a
paper.
The
teacher
provided
a
rewrite
option,
however,
so
using
to
be
would
not
necessarily
cause
you
to
repeat
the
class--only
if
you
refused
to
change
it
in
the
rewrite.
This
class
greatly
influenced
my
writing
and
caused
me
to
analyze
my
writing
for
the
passive
voice.
Since
then
I
have
not
been
as
vigilant
in
refraining
from
using
to
be
in
my
writing,
but
I
have
become
more
aware
of
the
passive
and
active
voices.
Eleventh
grade
also
marked
the
first
time
I
attempted
poetry
and
journalism.
A
poet
herself,
my
English
teacher
prodded
us
forward
into
the
world
of
poetry.
The
unit
we
did
on
poetry
focused
around
entering
several
poetry
contests
for
young
poets.
I
find
it
rather
ironic
that
my
first
forays
into
poetry
were
driven
by
an
urge
for
money
and
recognition,
since
poets
often
receive
neither.
I
decided
to
enter
the
comedy
contests.
The
first
poem
I
wrote
for
the
contest
continues
to
be
one
of
the
best
I
have
written
and
is
still
a
crowd
pleaser.
It
revolves
around
cigarettes
and
men
dressing
in
drag,
with
the
aptly
given
title,
One
Last
Drag.
Though
the
poem
did
not
win
the
contest,
which
I
suspect
was
due
to
the
controversial
nature
of
the
poem
and
the
non-adult
venue,
it
did
bring
me
recognition
as
a
poet
elsewhere.
My
English
class
took
a
trip
to
Allentown
College
for
their
poetry
awards
and
workshops.
During
the
open
reading,
amid
the
dark
and
melancholy
poetry
of
other
high
school
students,
I
got
up
and
read
my
poem,
One
Last
Drag,
entirely
changing
the
mood
of
the
event.
In
the
workshop
I
attended,
someone
praised
the
poem
without
knowing
I
had
written
it.
I
later
found
out
that
it
had
been
talked
about
in
other
workshops
as
well.
This
experience
left
me
feeling
good
about
my
work
and
gave
me
confidence
to
continue
that
has
not
diminished.
It
also
introduced
me
to
the
performance
element
of
reading
poetry,
something
much
different
from
the
written
aspect.
The
teacher
of
my
eleventh
grade
English
class,
also
advised
the
school
yearbook.
So
in
teaching
us
journalism,
there
was
also
the
hidden
agenda
of
trying
to
get
us
to
be
writers
for
the
yearbook.
I
wrote
an
article
about
a
friend
of
mine
who
had
scored
well
in
a
national
math
contest.
The
article
turned
out
fine
and
appeared
in
the
school
newspaper,
though
the
copy
in
the
paper
was
seriously
flawed
in
the
typing.
This
incident
showed
me
what
can
happen
to
ones
work
when
others
have
control
over
it.
The
cynicism
that
grew
out
of
this
experience
has
stayed
with
me
and
has
risen
its
head
when
my
works
were
published,
especially
when
the
type
setting
was
important
to
the
piece.
Instead
of
following
my
peers
into
the
yearbook,
I
decided
to
write
for
the
school
newspaper.
Although
most
everyone
who
writes
for
the
newspaper
takes
a
graded
newspaper
class,
I
did
not
have
enough
room
in
my
schedule
to
do
so.
Instead,
the
advisor
let
me
write
for
the
paper
without
taking
the
class.
I
soon
found
that
I
did
not
care
for
journalism,
mostly
because
I
was
not
an
aggressive
person.
My
first
assignment
came
out
well,
but
I
never
produced
a
good
second
one.
I
was
supposed
to
write
an
article
about
two
visiting
performers.
I
eventually
wrote
an
article
but
it
lacked
quotes;
I
had
not
interviewed
the
performers
when
they
had
been
at
the
school.
This
lack
of
a
story
resulted
in
getting
me
kicked
out
of
the
newspaper
by
my
editor.
The
combination
of
not
having
a
graded
incentive
and
my
passive
nature
had
ended
my
short
endeavor
as
a
journalist.
Coming
out
of
my
eleventh
grade
honors
English
class,
I
thought
that
my
12th
grade
AP
English
class
would
not
be
much
of
a
change
from
the
rigorous
class
I
had
just
finished.
That
assumption
turned
out
to
be
wrong
since
for
the
first
semester
alone
we
wrote
an
essay
a
day.
In
these
essays
we
explored
short
stories,
poetry,
and
plays
out
of
a
college
writing
text
book.
My
teacher
tried
to
elicit
concise,
well
thought
out
essays
from
us.
For
him,
a
story
might
have
several
meanings
but
there
was
the
great
interpretation.
He
forced
us
to
look
beyond
the
obvious
and
try
to
piece
together
the
story
in
such
a
way
that
we
might
arrive
at
this
meaning.
Through
that
class
my
writing
became
more
concise.
It
also
forced
me
to
look
beyond
the
obvious
and
try
to
get
at
a
deeper
meaning.
During
my
second
semester
at
Lafayette
I
took
Literary
Questions.
This
class
proved
to
be
especially
helpful
in
stressing
concise
and
rigorous
writing.
The
professor
forced
us
to
eliminate
redundancies
and
rephrase
our
sentences
in
such
a
way
that
we
might
be
able
to
state
a
point
concisely
and
eloquently.
The
professor
also
made
sure
that
we
wrestled
with
the
problems
at
hand
and
that
we
examined
our
points
fully.
This
tendency
to
not
fully
analyze
a
point
has
plagued
my
writing.
I
have
often
been
more
interested
in
the
grand
scheme
and
not
interested
in
the
minor
details.
I
have
been
able
to
combat
this
habit
by
careful
editing.
Unfortunately,
there
is
not
always
enough
time
to
edit
an
essay
to
the
point
where
it
is
both
rigorous
in
analysis
and
eloquent
in
language.
During
the
summers
after
my
first
and
sophomore
years
at
Lafayette,
I
worked
for
Academic
Computing
Services;
I
dealt
with
the
world
wide
web.
Though
the
web
is
now
used
by
millions
of
people,
during
that
first
summer
and
even
a
little
in
the
second,
most
people
were
unfamiliar
with
the
web
and
what
it
could
do.
At
first
I
created
and
redesigned
web
pages.
During
this
time
I
learned
how
to
better
format
and
frame
my
writing.
What
would
draw
the
reader
into
the
page?
I
also
worked
on
documentation
and
tutorials.
I
had
to
be
aware
of
my
audience
and
how
much
they
would
know.
I
also
had
to
word
my
sentences
in
such
a
way
that
they
would
be
unambiguous
and
that
they
could
stand
alone
out
on
the
web
with
out
me
having
to
intervene.
These
writings
had
to
be
systematic
and
easy
to
follow,
allowing
even
the
newest
users
to
perform
tasks
such
as
creating
a
homepage
or
installing
a
movie
viewer.
This
past
summer
I
was
engaged
in
technical
writing.
The
concept
of
who
the
audience
would
be
for
the
given
paper
was
extremely
important
for
the
project.
One
of
our
papers
was
for
a
group
of
technically,
but
not
necessarily
mathematically,
competent
computer
programmers.
For
the
papers
aimed
at
this
group
we
had
to
try
to
bring
out
the
more
computer
related
items
while
at
the
same
time
giving
a
sense
of
the
math.
The
latter
often
proved
difficult
because
the
ideas
were
often
very
technical
and
we
had
to
try
to
make
them
comprehensible
to
a
non-mathematical
audience.
This
type
of
writing
helped
me
focus
on
the
audience
and
what
should
be
explicitly
stated
in
a
paper.
