Writing:
A
Cultural
Perspective
I
remember
my
first
conscious
writing
effort.
I
was
just
turning
eight
and
I
was
learning
my
fourth
language.
Up
until
then
I
understood
language
and
consequently
writing
to
be
merely
a
tool
of
communication.
That
is,
I
would
use
language
to
communicate
and
I
would
read
it
in
order
to
acquaint
myself
with
the
surrounding
places.
By
age
eight
however,
I
was
in
school
for
two
years
and
writing
and
reading
seemed
to
open
my
imagination.
I
liked
to
write
because
it
helped
me
develop
my
thoughts.
But
at
the
same
time,
I
hated
writing
when
it
was
for
class.
For
some
reason
I
felt
that
writing
was
a
personal
journey,
and
it
was
hard
for
me
to
write
in
another
voice
other
than
the
personal
one.
I
did
not
like
my
writing
to
be
graded
either
because
I
felt
as
though
the
process
somehow
would
lose
its
meaning.
It
was
hard
for
me
to
write
because
I
never
thought
in
only
one
language
and
so
I
could
never
write
very
clearly
or
concisely.
I
was
always
thinking
in
a
self
created
amalgamation
of
languages
in
which
each
expression
or
word
was
a
cultural
allusion
that
I
only
could
understand.
In
short,
when
I
started
writing
language
went
from
a
communicative
tool
to
a
private
journey.
It
does
make
sense
then
that
I
was
drawn
to
poetry.
In
kindergarten
we
were
often
taught
songs,
but
in
elementary
school
these
songs
became
poems.
For
me,
poetry
was
an
abstract
alley
of
conversation,
and
it
was
a
discussion
in
which
I
could
create
and
expand
by
myself.
Looking
back,
my
early
poems
were
silly
and
pointless,
but
I
recognize
that
they
were
vital
to
my
writing
process.
Today,
when
I
read
some
old
poems
that
I
wrote,
I
find
value
not
in
their
cohesion,
but
in
their
jumbled
explosion
of
unstructured
emotions.
What
I
do
not
understand
is
what
I
appreciate.
Writing
for
me
is
the
struggle
to
understand
not
the
understanding
itself.
It
is
the
constant
attempt
to
reach
higher
and
farther
than
before.
Writing
is
not
quantitative
but
qualitative.
My
Israeli
elementary
school
was
right
next
door
to
the
Bahai
temple.
Sometimes
on
Fridays
we
would
go
on
field
trips
there
and
I
remember
the
elaborate
gardens
and
benches
for
meditation.
We
would
go
there
to
speak
and
sometimes
to
write.
The
Bahai
temple
was
very
important
to
all
of
us
because
of
its
serenity
and
I
have
strong
associations
with
it
when
I
write.
When
I
write
I
need
the
area
around
me
to
be
peaceful.
I
cannot
write
when
I
am
restless.
I
often
write
very
late
at
night
or
early
in
the
morning
because
of
the
quiet
and
the
calm.
I
like
to
hear
the
birds
at
dawn
when
I
write
or
the
cool
breeze
of
the
late
night.
I
find
it
very
soothing.
I
do
not
like
to
feel
others
around
me.
Writing
is
very
personal.
I
stop
writing
when
others
are
around
me.
I
suppose
that
I
need
to
feel
as
though
I
am
in
the
Bahai
gardens
of
my
childhood
protected
and
in
reconciled
thought.
Elementary
school
would
end
between
noon
and
two
in
the
afternoon.
When
I
would
come
home
in
addition
to
my
Hebrew
homework
I
worked
with
my
mother
on
my
Greek
lessons.
I
hated
learning
Greek.
I
enjoyed
learning
and
reading
about
the
Greek
myths,
but
I
was
tired
of
absorbing
so
much
information.
Verb
conjugation
was
a
game,
but
spelling
and
repetitive
exercises
were
boring
and
seemed
purposeless
to
me.
I
had
more
fun
with
the
creative
process,
with
the
ideas
and
the
concepts.
I
liked
words
like
hubris
because
they
represented
so
much
more
than
what
they
meant.
I
learned
to
appreciate
my
heritage
very
quickly.
Understanding
and
exploring
my
culture
was
invaluable
to
my
learning
process
and
consequently
to
my
writing
approach.
Today
when
I
sit
in
a
classroom,
my
vocabulary
is
largely
based
on
Greek
roots.
I
do
not
think
my
writing
style
is
directly
influenced
by
Greek
methods,
but
I
think
that
often
I
rely
on
Greek
sophistry
to
analyze
and
develop
my
thoughts
and
my
writing.
When
we
moved
and
I
entered
an
American-Anglo
environment
my
writing
began
changing
towards
its
most
recent
phase.
Since
school
lasted
until
the
late
afternoon,
Greek
lessons
were
pushed
to
alternative
weekends.
All
the
hours
at
school
then
concentrated
on
one
language:
English.
As
opposed
to
Hebrew
of
which
my
parents
knew
very
little
and
could
not
help
with
my
school
work,
English
was
more
familiar.
My
parents
could
assist
me
at
least
on
the
elementary
level.
We
did
not
speak
English
at
home,
but
I
did
get
help
for
the
first
time
with
my
writing
from
home.
At
first
my
vocabulary
was
shuffled
because
Hebrew
and
English
are
not
alike
at
all
and
the
transition
was
bumpy.
My
words
were
limited,
but
my
exposure
to
new
sounds
was
definitely
a
help.
I
moved
from
ESL
to
the
regular
literature
class
and
then
onto
the
advanced
one
in
a
few
years.
Although
the
jump
from
level
to
level
was
a
positive
one,
every
time
I
did
change
sections,
I
left
parts
behind
that
until
today
I
have
not
managed
to
tackle.
My
spelling
is
awful,
for
example.
Since
English
spelling
is
not
phonetic,
but
Hebrew
and
Greek
are,
it
was
hard
for
me
to
learn
to
spell
in
English.
I
had
to
memorize
what
words
looked
like
rather
than
learn
to
sound
them
out.
Similarly,
punctuation
and
sentence
structure
are
always
obstacles
because
I
often
do
not
sense
them
as
naturally
as
native
speakers.
Even
though
these
are
details,
they
all
add
up
in
constructing
writing.
Thanks
to
Spellcheck
some
of
these
obstacles'
influence
can
be
diminished,
but
I
feel
that
my
writing
style
is
still
influenced
by
these
deficits.
For
example,
I
am
horrible
with
transitions,
introductions
and
everything
in
the
middle
and
end.
Today
(see),
with
computers
and
their
increased
availability
and
easy
usage,
I
find
at
least
the
technical
aspects
of
writing
helped.
About
ten
years
ago,
when
I
did
not
use
a
computer
to
write,
it
was
hard
enough
cranking
the
rough
draft
out
and
then
recopying
onto
a
final
draft
form.
It
took
hours
just
to
complete
the
manual
work.
Now,
with
computers,
more
of
my
time
is
invested
in
thought
development.
I
like
to
think
about
my
topic
before
hand
and
let
it
sink
in.
I
also
like
to
look
for
inspirational
points.
I
like
to
find
ways
of
approaching
a
topic
that
are
unexpected
and
that
differ
from
someone
else's
perspective.
I
love
writing
late
at
night
and
I
hate
proofreading
my
work.
I
am
never
satisfied
with
what
I
write
and
I
always
need
a
deadline
to
complete
a
paper.
I
love
to
write,
but
often
it
becomes
a
masochistic
relationship.
I
do
not
think
that
I
have
actually
written
anything
that
I
was
entirely
happy
with.
I
am
not
sure
why
that
is.
I
am
a
perfectionist,
but
there
is
no
set
ceiling
to
my
standards.
I
want
to
be
Faulkner
overnight
and
I
do
not
think
that
such
high
expectations
are
helpful
to
my
writing
process.
I
wish
I
appreciated
my
work
more,
so
that
I
could
grow
from
it
rather
than
struggle
to
disprove
it.
I
still
hate
to
be
graded.
Especially
now
when
I
realize
that
grading
and
good
writing
is
subjective.
Now
more
than
ever
I
think
the
process
should
be
qualitative
rather
than
quantitative.
I
care
very
much
about
what
others
think
of
my
writing
even
though
I
would
like
to
believe
that
I
do
not
care.
Writing
is
still
very
private,
but
I
have
also
learned
to
develop
my
public
writing.
I
work
on
my
own
pieces,
but
I
largely
focus
on
my
academic
requirements.
I
wish
I
had
more
time
to
work
on
my
pieces-
I
wish
I
could
take
a
class
that
would
help
me
take
my
poems
and
my
stories
and
really
sharpen
them
up.
I
mean
why
am
I
learning
to
write
and
to
analyze
and
to
really
investigate
how
I
write?
As
far
as
academic
demands,
I
do
not
mind
research
papers,
but
they
are
pretty
boring.
I
like
the
investigation
and
I
like
combining
proof
with
my
ideas,
but
I
do
not
think
research
papers
are
as
exciting
as
creating
a
story
and
developing
characters
and
plot.
I
really
like
ideas,
and
challenging
thoughts
rather
than
writing
clearly.
Many
professors
expect
wanted
me
to
write
about
a
smaller
topic,
but
more
clearly
and
I
could
not
do
that.
When
I
think
of
one
issue
I
cannot
separate
it
from
another,
everything
is
interrelated,
or
so
I
think
and
I
cannot
condense
it
to
suit
clarity
and
precision.
Overall,
I
do
not
think
that
my
writing
has
changed
all
that
much.
The
style
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
when
I
first
came
to
Lafayette,
the
approach
is
too.
I
think
that
with
constant
feedback,
I
learned
to
share
my
writing
and
consequently
make
it
more
clear
for
others
to
understand
my
world
of
thoughts.
I
think
that
I
have
thousands
of
miles
more
to
cover
to
reach
any
level
of
satisfaction,
but
this
is
a
form
I
like
and
will
continue
to
battle
with.
The
most
important
realization
I
have
of
my
writing
is
linked
with
the
idea
that
writing
is
a
continuous
process,
it
does
not
end
and
begin
it
flows.
[all
around
the
world
everywhere
I
go
no
one
understands
me
no
one
knows
what
I'm
trying
to
say
but
you
you
speak
my
language
