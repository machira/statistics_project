Road

Writing
Associate
Assignment
Lafayette
College
There
is
an
art
in
reading,
as
well
as
in
thinking,
and
an
art
in
writing
(Isaac
D'Israeli).
This
past
year
I
began
to
appreciate
this
idea
from
a
different
angle
as
a
writer.
The
process
of
reading,
thinking,
and
writing
has
always
been
my
approach
to
a
writing
assignment.
I
became
accustomed
to
this
approach
from
an
arts
and
humanities
background.
Until
this
past
year,
I
had
little
experience
writing
from
an
engineering
perspective.
This
new
perspective
became
a
new
challenge
for
me
as
a
writer
and
Writing
Associate.
My
Engineering
VAST
course
and
WA
assignment
enabled
my
journey
to
commence
down
the
road
to
becoming
a
more
proficient
writer
as
an
engineer.
Shortly
into
my
journey
I
realized
that
I
would
have
to
change
my
style
of
writing
to
attain
an
engineering
perspective.
The
extensive
use
of
metaphors
and
analogies
that
I
had
previously
grown
accustomed
to
would
have
to
be
replaced
by
technical
terms,
clarity,
and
brevity.
I
thought
that
it
seemed
contradictory
to
write
in
a
succinct
and
technical
manner
when
some
words
were
long
enough
to
be
a
sentence.
I
struggled
to
achieve
a
balance
in
my
first
writing
assignment
for
my
fall
semester
VAST
course.
My
assignment
was
to
write
a
ten
to
twelve
page
paper
on
an
aspect
of
engineering
that
has
raised
ethical
issues.
The
topic
I
decided
to
focus
on
was
genetic
engineering.
As
I
began
my
research,
I
discovered
that
genetic
engineering
was
a
broad
topic.
I
actually
checked
out
thirty
books
relating
to
my
topic.
I
began
sifting
through
my
new
library
of
books
to
narrow
down
my
topic.
The
use
of
notecards
became
a
useful
tactic
in
processing
the
information
that
each
book
offered.
After
a
week
of
reading
and
writing
on
many
notecards,
it
was
time
to
write
my
paper.
I
began
my
paper
with
a
blank
stare
at
the
legal
pad
wondering
how
I
was
going
to
write
twelve
pages.
This
initial
sense
of
foreboding
gave
me
the
chance
to
think
how
I
was
going
to
construct
my
paper,
and
how
the
notecards
would
help
me
piece
together
this
puzzling
paper.
The
introduction
was
a
struggle
though.
I
attempted
to
write
my
introduction
and
thesis
statement
before
I
really
discovered
what
I
had
to
say
about
genetic
engineering.
As
Nancy
Sommers
would
say,
I
was
trying
to
follow
this
linear
model
of
writing
in
an
attempt
to
write
an
ideal
paper.1
This
was
restricting
the
development
of
my
paper.
Once
I
concentrated
on
the
body
of
my
paper,
the
pen
started
to
flow.
I
was
figuring
out
what
I
had
to
say
about
certain
areas
of
genetic
engineering.
The
more
I
wrote,
the
more
I
discovered
exactly
what
I
had
wanted
to
say.
This
snowball
effect
of
enlightenment
allowed
me
to
complete
the
body
of
my
paper
and
reach
a
conclusion.
The
flexible
approach
that
I
had
taken
to
writing
the
body
of
my
paper
enabled
me
to
revise
and
shape
my
paper
as
I
was
writing.
Furthermore,
I
was
able
to
construct
a
thesis
statement
that
correlated
with
the
body
of
my
paper.
Revising
my
introduction
was
no
struggle
with
the
aid
of
the
new
thesis
statement.
Focusing
on
an
audience
helped
me
polish
my
rough
draft.
With
the
deadline
rapidly
approaching,
a
few
more
last
minute
revisions
were
made
before
I
handed
in
my
twelve
page
paper.
I
received
a
good
grade.
Although
the
paper
was
not
as
ideal
as
I
had
wanted
it
to
be,
I
learned
a
valuable
lesson.
I
was
beginning
to
transform
into
an
advanced
writer.
This
metamorphosis
would
help
me
to
deal
with
the
frustrations
of
others
as
a
Writing
Associate.
My
first
meeting
as
a
Writing
Associate
was
like
writing
my
twelve
page
paper.
There
was
the
initial
fear
of
what
to
say
and
how
to
successfully
begin
the
meeting.
After
talking
to
the
student
and
overcoming
my
initial
fear,
I
settled
down
and
discussed
the
paper
with
the
student.
I
focused
on
a
few
areas
of
concern
with
the
student
and
tried
not
to
dominate
the
conversation.
I
also
tried
to
make
sure
that
the
student
agreed
on
where
the
paper
needed
improvement
and
how
it
might
be
improved.
Surprisingly,
the
meeting
went
better
than
I
had
anticipated.
This
gave
me
the
confidence
I
needed
for
the
following
meetings.
These
meetings
offered
a
variety
of
outcomes.
Two
students
could
have
similar
problems
with
their
papers,
but
their
different
personalities
would
have
an
impact
on
the
conference.
Most
conferences
ended
with
the
student
lacking
confidence,
me
being
too
assertive,
or
successfully.
None
of
my
conferences
were
as
ideal
as
the
conference
It
Just
Didn't
Make
Sense
described
by
Thomas
Newkirk.2
Nonetheless,
I
was
beginning
to
learn
how
to
become
a
better
gambler
wagering
on
assertiveness
and
silence
in
conferences.
I
was
learning
how
to
become
a
better
Writing
Associate.
My
previous
progress
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
further
improve
my
writing.
My
next
writing
assignment
was
to
write
another
ten
to
twelve
page
paper.
This
time
the
paper
had
to
focus
on
an
aspect
of
engineering
that
has
raised
legal
issues.
I
began
my
assignment
by
quickly
selecting
a
topic.
I
focused
on
automobiles.
I
narrowed
down
my
topic
even
further
and
concentrated
on
automobile
emissions.
This
enabled
me
to
avoid
some
of
the
initial
sifting
through
endless
books.
I
only
checked
out
fifteen
books
and
spent
less
time
processing
the
information.
After
a
few
days
of
reading,
I
began
the
writing
process.
This
time
I
was
not
as
concerned
with
the
introduction.
I
wrote
a
brief
introduction
and
quickly
started
working
on
the
body
of
my
paper.
Next
I
wrote
a
brief
conclusion
after
completing
the
body
of
my
paper.
I
directed
my
attention
back
to
the
body
of
my
paper
and
made
more
revisions
to
capture
exactly
what
I
had
wanted
to
say.
After
completing
this,
I
was
able
to
improve
my
brief
introduction
and
conclusion
accordingly.
By
focusing
on
what
I
wanted
to
discuss
in
the
body
of
my
paper,
I
was
able
to
shape
and
form
my
paper
with
little
struggle.
This
gave
me
more
time
to
examine
ways
to
better
achieve
clarity
and
brevity.
I
tinkered
with
sentence
structure
and
length
to
add
variety.
I
also
tried
to
avoid
beginning
sentences
the
same
repetitive
way.
Once
I
had
finished
polishing
up
my
paper,
I
handed
in
my
twelve
page
paper
once
again.
This
time
I
felt
that
the
writing
experience
had
been
more
rewarding.
Although
my
paper
received
the
same
grade
as
before,
I
had
ventured
further
in
my
journey.
I
had
struggled
less
with
writing
a
paper
that
was
more
difficult
and
not
as
interesting
as
the
previous
paper.
I
was
becoming
a
more
proficient
and
efficient
writer
in
the
academic
community
of
engineering.
The
second
round
of
conferences
had
approached.
At
this
point
I
was
eager
to
share
some
of
my
enlightenment
with
the
students.
I
focused
on
the
body
of
each
student's
paper
when
I
read
over
their
papers.
I
wanted
to
find
out
what
they
were
trying
to
say
in
order
to
suggest
how
they
could
make
improvements.
I
also
introduced
this
concept
of
examining
the
body
of
the
paper
in
conferences.
My
conferences
began
with
the
student
and
I
focusing
on
the
body
of
the
paper.
I
suggested
areas
where
the
paper
lacked
clarity
or
could
be
condensed
to
enable
the
paper
to
flow
better.
This
allowed
for
the
argument
of
the
paper
to
surface.
Once
the
argument
had
surfaced,
the
student
could
then
modify
the
thesis
to
fit
the
argument.
This
modification
of
the
thesis
was
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
conferences.
I
did
strive
to
make
as
much
progress
as
possible
in
each
conference.
My
motivation
pushed
me
to
become
a
high
stakes
gambler
as
a
Writing
Associate.
I
decided
to
hold
nothing
back
in
the
conferences.
This
risk
led
to
some
successful
conferences,
as
well
as
some
unsuccessful
conferences.
Regardless,
I
offered
an
outsider's
viewpoint
and
suggested
ways
to
improve
each
paper.
After
the
second
round
of
conferences
ended,
I
felt
a
growing
sense
of
confidence
as
a
Writing
associate.
For
the
first
time
I
began
to
feel
like
a
WA.
The
third
and
final
round
of
conferences
had
arrived
with
the
fall
semester
almost
completed.
My
VAST
course
had
only
offered
a
sprinkling
of
three
to
five
page
papers
in
these
last
few
weeks.
These
papers
offered
some
insight
into
the
length
of
a
paper.
Five
page
papers
were
the
assignments
of
the
students
in
my
conferences.
Although
five
page
papers
required
less
writing
as
opposed
to
twelve
page
papers,
there
was
a
greater
emphasis
on
clarity.
Clarity
did
create
some
pressure
to
write
perfect
sentences
that
did
not
include
the
fat
of
excess
words.
I
focused
on
easing
this
pressure
in
my
conferences
by
"cutting
the
fat"
from
the
paper
with
each
student.
We
worked
on
identifying
where
the
fat
was
and
how
to
get
rid
of
the
fat.
This
idea,
along
with
the
ideas
from
the
previous
conferences,
gave
the
students
tools
to
work
with.
This
idea
and
final
reflection
also
brought
my
assignment
as
a
Writing
Associate
to
an
end.
My
spring
semester
courses
offered
fewer
writing
assignments.
No
longer
a
Writing
Associate,
my
journey
seemed
to
have
come
to
an
abrupt
halt.
My
EXCEL
Research,
which
led
me
away
from
being
a
WA,
eventually
changed
things.
Well
into
the
semester
I
found
myself
preparing
to
give
a
poster
presentation
on
my
research.
I
also
found
myself
explaining
my
research
(that
took
months
to
perfect
and
complete)
in
a
few
short
sentences.
These
sentences
in
large
bold
font
needed
to
be
visible
to
spectators,
making
diction
very
important.
The
overall
presentation
offered
a
refreshing
idea:
creativity.
My
creative
juices
began
to
flow
as
I
constructed
an
interesting
presentation
based
on
monotonous
lab
experiments.
My
poster
presentation
breathed
new
life
into
writing
for
me
as
well.
I
was
inspired
by
this
feeling
of
creativity
that
was
lacking
in
the
field
of
engineering.
I
began
writing
poetry
to
make
use
of
this
creativity.
Poetry
allowed
me
to
forget
about
the
tediousness
of
academic
writing.
I
also
realized
that
writing
consists
of
layers
of
simplicity
and
complexity
that
requires
form
and
balance
to
speak
volumes.
Writing
poetry
was
my
way
of
experimenting
and
taking
risks
to
speak
volumes.
This
experimentation,
along
with
my
research
experimentation
as
an
EXCEL
Scholar,
has
been
continuing
throughout
this
summer.
The
journey
to
become
a
proficient
writer
as
an
engineer
has
also
continued.
I
know
that
more
will
be
demanded
of
me
from
my
courses
this
upcoming
semester.
I
am
looking
forward
to
the
challenge,
and
plan
to
excel
in
any
writing
assignment.
As
a
returning
Writing
Associate,
I
intend
to
gain
more
insight
from
the
conferences
to
improve
as
a
WA
and
writer.
Although
my
journey
is
not
complete,
I
have
travelled
down
the
long
and
winding
road
and
made
progress.
This
barren
road
seems
to
lack
engineers
unfortunately.
I
am
proud
to
say
that
this
is
the
road
that
I
have
taken.
For,
I
want
to
be
a
proficient
writer
as
an
engineer.
Even
though
the
struggle
may
be
great,
achieving
this
goal
will
make
all
the
difference.
