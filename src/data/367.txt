Professor
Carpenter
Life
as
a
Writing
Associate
Writing
with
title
of
Writing
Associate
and
being
a
peer
tutor,
which
involves
helping
people
with
their
writing,
comes
with
a
unique
set
of
responsibilities
and
actions.
Through
the
course
of
a
year
you
are
not
only
responsible
for
forty
students
and
helping
them
succeed
as
writers,
you
are
also
suppose
to
take
your
own
knowledge
that
you
regularly
disperse
in
the
Pardee
WA
room
and
be
a
successful
writer
as
well.
Within
the
past
year
I
have
learned
a
lot
about
my
writing
and
the
task
of
being
a
WA.
Within
the
following
account
of
my
junior
year
as
a
writer
and
WA,
I
will
tell
you
what
I
learned
and
thought
quite
valuable
for
my
writing
as
well
as
enabling
others
to
become
better
writers.
There
are
many
pitfalls
that
are
waiting
for
new
WA's,
and
it
is
my
hope
that
quite
a
few
of
them
can
be
avoided
by
showing
how
a
veteran
WA
stumbled
into
them
and
still
managed
to
be
successful.
Most
importantly,
just
because
one
is
hired
as
a
WA,
does
not
mean
that
their
writing
is
perfect
and
will
always
receive
the
grade
of
an
A.
I
thought
now
that
I
had
successfully
managed
to
be
hired
as
a
writing
associate
that
I
would
suddenly
be
a
flawless
writer
and
everything
I
wrote
should
be
worthy
of
being
published.
Therefore,
I
painstakingly
labored
over
each
paper.
I
intentionally
chose
difficult
and
challenging
topics
that
really
did
nothing
but
bore
me.
I
became
best
friends
with
the
thesaurus,
because
I
thought
that
I
should
have
a
huge
vocabulary
being
a
WA.
I
redid
transitions
over
and
over
and
there
was
no
paragraph
that
did
not
flow
from
one
to
the
other.
However,
in
this,
writing
lost
all
its
fun
and
excitement.
In
fact,
looking
back
on
my
papers
now
they
are
terrible.
The
language
and
words
I
used
just
sound
awkward,
and
I
need
the
dictionary
to
understand
what
I
was
writing
because
most
of
the
words
are
foreign
to
me.
I
got
caught
in
the
trap
that
WA's
are
perfect.
I
thought
my
papers
should
be
perfect,
but
in
fact
they
are
not.
I
make
grammar
mistakes
and
spelling
mistakes
all
the
time.
If
I
do
not
have
someone
look
over
my
paper
it
is
usually
horrible.
However,
what
I
forgot
was,
to
write
well
you
have
to
have
some
sort
of
passion
about
the
topic
that
you
choose.
This
does
not
mean
that
you
have
to
love
each
topic
you
write
about.
But
you
have
to
have
some
opinion
that
is
clear,
evident,
and
well
supported.
It
took
me
almost
a
year
to
realize
that
writing
is
fun
and
I
am
good
at
it
when
I
am
writing
about
something
I
believe
and
want
to
voice
to
others.
Don't
write
to
impress
a
professor
or
prove
you
are
a
WA.
Write
for
yourself
and
what
you
teach
to
others
in
conferences
will
slowly
incorporate
itself
into
your
writing
as
well.
However,
within
the
job
of
being
a
writing
associate
do
not
try
to
be
the
super
WA.
You
must
set
definitive
rules
and
regulations
for
your
students
and
not
give
in
or
your
students
will
walk
all
over
you.
For
example,
my
first
assignment
was
to
a
three
hundred
level
writing
class
with
mostly
seniors.
I
made
the
mistake
of
being
too
nice
and
accommodating.
Don't
misinterpret
what
I
am
saying,
it
is
important
to
be
a
good
WA,
but
do
not
let
others
take
advantage
of
you.
I
was
quick
to
allow
students
to
reschedule,
and
I
found
myself
sitting
in
the
WA
room
for
hours
with
no
students
and
when
I
got
back
to
my
room,
I
had
five
or
six
messages
from
people
that
wanted
to
reschedule
because
they
decided
to
play
frisbee
or
go
shopping
instead.
This
lead
to
phone
calls
at
12:30
in
the
morning
with
students
who
wanted
to
discuss
their
paper.
And
then,
it
lead
to
people
bringing
no
draft
and
just
wanting
me
to
repeat
exactly
what
the
professor
told
me
and
give
them
ideas
from
other
students
papers.
Being
a
junior,
I
admit
that
I
was
slightly
intimidated
and
let
the
student
take
control,
however
this
was
a
mistake.
And
after
over
extending
myself,
and
arriving
at
Pardee
during
dinner
and
lunch
and
every
free
moment
I
had,
I
got
evaluations
that
said
that
I
was
never
available
or
incompetent,
or
had
no
knowledge
of
writing.
It
is
important
that
you
are
a
good
competent
WA,
but
you
must
set
rules
and
not
over
extend
yourself.
Otherwise
you
will
find
that
there
is
no
time
for
your
homework
or
down
time.
As
one
of
my
students
told
me
you
are
at
my
disposal
at
any
time,
is
not
accurate
at
all.
After,
WAing
a
three
hundred
level
class
in
my
major,
I
then
was
assigned
to
an
engineering
class.
I
rarely
ventured
into
the
Alumni
Hall
of
Engineering,
let
alone
knew
anything
on
the
topic
of
scientific
writing.
With
my
first
assignment
I
was
nervous
because
I
was
younger
than
all
my
students,
and
now
I
was
nervous
because
I
was
completely
incompetent
on
the
topic
of
engineering.
However,
the
assignment
turned
out
to
be
one
of
my
most
enjoyable
experiences
as
a
writer.
However,
I
had
to
do
quite
a
bit
of
reading
in
the
Saint
Martin's
Handbook
to
learn
how
to
write
in
a
technical
manner,
and
I
had
never
heard
of
APA
style
until
then.
However,
the
students
were
quite
helpful
and
most
of
then
wanted
to
come
to
the
WA
meetings.
In
fact
for
the
first
time,
I
did
not
have
to
dominate
all
of
the
meetings
and
their
students
came
to
their
meetings
with
specific
questions
and
concerns
which
gave
them
much
better
and
more
specific
help
with
their
paper.
This
leads
directly
into
another
encounter
that
you
are
sure
to
be
faced
with
during
your
time
as
a
WA.
You
are
almost
guaranteed
to
get
at
least
a
few
students
that
do
not
talk.
And,
they
are
being
silent
not
because
they
are
embarrassed
about
their
writing
or
are
shy,
they
are
not
talking
because
they
do
not
care,
and
they
think
coming
to
your
meeting
is
a
waste
of
time.
In
this
case,
I
address
my
concerns
and
ask
questions
which
I
try
to
phrase
so
a
yes
or
no
answer
is
not
applicable,
however
sometimes
there
is
just
a
resounding
silence
in
a
WA
meeting.
And
as
a
WA
there
is
not
much
you
can
do.
The
student
gets
out
of
the
WA
meeting
exactly
what
he
puts
into
it.
You
can
not
make
some
one
care
or
listen.
So
address
what
you
see
wrong
and
end
the
meaning
early
if
necessary.
When
student
comes
with
a
very
negative
attitude
they
are
not
only
wasting
their
time,
they
are
wasting
yours.
Also,
the
relationship
with
the
WA
and
the
professor
is
a
very
important
partnership.
I
have
learned
through
out
the
last
year
the
more
the
professors
helps
the
WA,
the
easier
the
WA's
job
is
when
she
must
help
the
students
in
conferences.
For
example,
my
first
professor
was
so
specific
he
left
no
question
unanswered.
The
assignment
to
do
list
would
be
multiple
pages.
Everything
would
be
clearly
and
specifically
written
out.
There
was
a
clear
attendance
policy
and
clear
due
dates.
This
helped
tremendously
when
I
had
to
convey
information
tot
he
students.
I
knew
exactly
what
to
focus
on
and
I
did
not
feel
like
I
was
guessing
or
going
on
a
hunch
when
the
students
asked
me
what
the
professor
was
looking
for.
However.
My
second
professor
didn't
seem
to
have
the
time
to
meet
with
me
and
kept
the
assignments
a
secret,
and
it
was
my
job
to
uncover
the
secret
from
my
WA
students.
It
took
an
entire
round
of
conferences
for
me
to
finally
be
able
to
see
the
grading
sheet
that
the
professor
used
for
all
the
papers.
Here,
I
never
had
confidence
in
what
I
was
saying
in
the
early
meetings,
but
my
students
helped
a
lot
and
showed
me
their
notes
and
what
the
professor
said.
Here,
it
was
a
true
partnership
between
the
WA
and
the
student.
It
was
hard
for
me
to
break
away
from
the
tutor/
student
scenario.
At
times
it
can
feel
like
I
am
dictating
right
and
wrong
and
the
student
just
sits
and
takes
notes.
But
when
there
is
a
dialogue
and
the
student
ask
questions
or
even
disagrees
with
you,
the
WA
process
is
at
it's
best.
There
are
two
minds
collaborating
to
make
a
paper
better.
The
student
is
using
me
to
help
make
the
paper
better,
but
is
not
allowing
me
to
take
over,
the
paper
is
still
theirs.
Through
out
the
last
year
I
have
learned
a
lot
as
a
WA
and
as
a
writer.
For
a
while
I
lost
the
joy
of
writing
because
I
was
in
search
of
perfection
and
writing
lost
all
its
passion.
I
also
started
off
being
the
meek
WA
and
had
to
be
assertive
and
stand
up
for
myself.
When
the
WA
process
is
working
like
it
should
a
paper
can
truly
be
enhanced.
In
fact,
I
enjoy
taking
my
papers
into
drop
in
just
to
get
a
second
opinion
and
just
talking
about
what
I
have
written.
However,
what
is
most
important
is
nothing
in
writing
is
perfect.
You
will
have
great
meetings
and
you
will
have
ones
that
do
not
go
so
well.
As
a
writer
you
will
write
great
papers
and
you
will
write
one's
that
you
are
embarrassed
to
have
your
name
on.
Writing
is
a
process
that
involves
growth
and
throughout
the
coming
year
as
a
WA
you
will
grow
as
a
person
being
assertive
and
confident
in
meetings
and
you
will
grow
as
a
writer,
possibly
learning
new
techniques
from
your
classes
professor
and
experimenting
with
them
in
your
own
works.
As
long
as
you
are
always
trying,
things
will
go
well
and
you
will
feel
rewarded
at
the
conclusion
of
the
year.
