Throughout
most
of
my
life,
writing
was
mainly
considered
to
be
an
assignment
received
from
teachers
in
school.
Whether
it
was
done
at
home,
or
in
the
classroom,
these
assignments
were
nothing
more
than
fulfilling
the
teacherOs
demands,
while
also
trying
to
reach
the
endpoint
as
fast
as
possible.
It
was
not
until
I
matured,
in
high
school
and
college
years,
that
I
realized
that
writing
had
many
other
purposes.
These
purposes
may
include
a
form
of
expression,
a
means
of
communication,
and
a
way
of
transmitting
information.
In
order
to
realize
the
various
purposes
of
writing,
I
believe
the
changes
in
my
attitude
towards
writing
were
necessary
to
create
the
writer
I
am
today.
In
addition,
peopleOs
feedback
and
reactions
to
my
writing
had
a
large
impact
on
my
abilities
and
attitude,
as
they
were
most
important
in
shaping
my
outlook.
Besides
the
moment
of
learning
how
to
write
my
name,
in
pre-school,
my
first
memorable
writing
experience
occurred
in
2nd
grade,
when
I
was
about
7
years
old.
This
writing
experience,
although
not
my
first,
was
memorable
to
me
because
it
was
a
creative
writing
project.
We
were
told
to
write
a
story
about
any
topic,
with
little
guidelines
given
to
us,
besides
a
two-page
limit,
with
wide
ruled
paper.
Of
course
back
then,
the
writing
tools
I
used
were
mainly
pencil,
using
pen
only
when
I
was
positive
that
it
was
my
final
draft.
In
order
to
create
a
final
draft,
I
first
had
to
go
through
a
fair
amount
of
rough
drafts,
using
pencil
and
eraser,
making
sure
to
correct
any
grammatical
errors
after
re-reading
it
many
times.
After
a
page
was
marked
up,
I
would
write
it
again
on
a
new
sheet
of
paper,
still
using
pencil,
as
the
chances
of
there
being
a
mistake
was
still
very
high.
If
I
was
at
home
during
this
process,
many
of
these
steps
would
be
co-handled
by
my
mom,
especially
if
it
was
late
at
night,
or
near
a
deadline
for
school.
If
a
draft
of
a
paper
was
finally
finished,
the
product
would
be
in
pen
or
pencil,
written
very
neatly.
Unfortunately,
for
my
creative
writing
project
in
2nd
grade,
all
the
work
was
done
in
school,
so
a
lot
of
mistakes
were
left
uncorrected.
Since
I
had
more
freedoms
than
I
usually
did
for
this
paper,
especially
since
my
mom
wasnOt
correcting
any
of
my
mistakes,
I
decided
to
make
my
story
in
book
format.
This
book
format
included
two
whole
chapters,
and
what
was
later
discovered
to
be
a
cliffhanger
at
the
end
of
the
first
chapter.
My
story
was
almost
a
perfect
reflection
of
my
favorite
movie
at
the
time,
Apollo
13.
In
this
memory,
I
vividly
remember
writing
about
astronauts
who
barely
survived
the
amazingly
adventurous
journey
out
to
the
moon.
My
cliffhanger
at
the
end
of
the
first
chapter
was
a
sudden
malfunction
in
various
wires
around
the
spacecraft,
leaving
the
astronauts
in
a
very
dangerous
situation.
Of
course
I
finished
my
second
chapter
by
explaining
how
all
the
astronauts
survived,
by
fixing
all
malfunctions
in
the
ship,
and
returning
home
to
earth
being
glorified
as
heroes.
While
writing
my
first
creative
project
in
second
grade,
I
remember
feeling
very
happy
and
excited
to
re-tell
the
story
of
Apollo,
just
using
different
names
and
titles,
so
that
even
people
who
saw
the
movie
would
not
recognize
my
plot.
What
I
was
even
more
excited
for
was
the
reaction
I
would
get
from
my
fellow
classmates,
who
were
instructed
to
read
other
peopleOs
stories,
and
to
give
them
feedback
on
their
work.
My
favorite
part
was
watching
my
classmatesO
reactions
to
the
cliffhanger
I
left
at
the
end
of
the
first
chapter,
since
the
ending
I
was
aware
of
was
unknown
to
them.
By
looking
back
at
this
memory
of
mine,
I
realize
how
much
fun
and
enthusiasm
I
had
for
creative
writing
projects,
influencing
me
to
have
a
positive
outlook
on
writing
while
coming
out
of
early
elementary
school.
Later
on,
beginning
in
mid
elementary
years
(4th
grade)
to
late
middle
school
years
(8th
grade),
I
remember
many
long
and
drawn
out
experiences
of
writing
assignments.
Often
times,
students
received
prompts
of
some
sort
relating
to
a
particular
subject,
whether
social
studies
or
English,
then
we
were
told
to
write
either
paragraph
responses
or
short
essay
responses.
Sometimes
we
would
have
to
respond
to
a
picture
given
to
us,
or
connect
various
pieces
of
information
with
a
common
connection.
The
reason
for
doing
these
practices
was
to
prepare
for
the
ELA
exam,
or
the
English
Language
Arts
exam,
which
was
given
to
all
4th
and
8th
graders.
On
this
exam,
there
was
a
lot
of
reading
comprehension
and
writing
responses,
with
the
test
lasting
almost
a
week.
The
tools
we
used
for
this
exam
were
often
packets
with
various
prompts
inside,
using
pencils
and
pens
when
necessary,
and
using
the
lines
given
to
us
to
write
our
responses
(usually
the
number
of
lines
given
indicated
how
long
the
response
should
be).
Preparation
for
these
exams
were
exhausting,
as
they
often
took
up
most
of
the
time
allotted
for
English
and
even
social
studies
classes,
and
were
drawn
out
for
almost
half
the
school
year,
as
the
exams
were
administered
in
January.
Even
when
we
werenOt
preparing
for
a
specific
exam,
it
seemed
like
most
of
the
writing
during
this
time
period
was
aimed
at
fulfilling
a
specific
demand
or
question,
sometimes
relating
to
a
prompt
given
to
us
by
the
teacher.
This
type
of
writing
was
not
something
I
enjoyed
or
looked
forward
to,
and
began
to
churn
a
dislike
for
writing
in
general
during
these
years.
Another
reason
why
this
style
of
writing
was
not
very
pleasurable
to
me
was
that
reactions
to
most
of
my
writing
in
this
time
period
were
usually
negative
comments
or
responses.
Rather
than
looking
forward
to
peopleOs
emotional
reactions
or
feelings,
as
I
enjoyed
in
early
childhood,
I
had
to
await
the
many
criticisms
of
teachers,
aids,
and
even
my
parents.
These
criticisms
were
not
very
constructive
in
my
eyes,
but
rather,
were
quite
negative
and
aimed
at
how
I
should
correct
my
writing
to
improve
upon
my
abilities
to
respond
to
any
given
prompt
or
question.
In
addition
to
receiving
constant
criticism,
I
was
forced
to
participate
in
various
writing
preparation
courses,
which
were
a
supplement
to
normal
courses
during
the
school
year,
in
order
to
improve
my
chances
of
being
satisfactory
on
upcoming
exams.
These
courses
were
often
after
school,
and
were
something
I
strongly
disliked
during
the
time
I
was
enrolled
in
them.
Luckily,
things
began
to
turn
around
once
I
entered
high
school,
as
there
were
no
longer
any
state
administered
exams
to
prepare
for,
such
as
the
ELA
exam.
Instead
we
usually
focused
on
well-known
American
novels
such
as
The
Great
Gatsby,
To
Kill
a
Mockingbird,
Catcher
in
the
Rye,
and
many
others.
Since
these
were
the
center
of
attention
in
many
of
my
English
courses
in
high
school,
I
began
to
enjoy
writing
more,
as
I
was
enjoying
the
reading
material
given
to
us.
Although
we
were
sometimes
still
given
prompts
or
themed
essays
to
write
about
concerning
a
specific
novel,
I
found
myself
to
be
fairly
good
at
writing
about
books
that
I
enjoyed
reading.
English
classes
began
to
be
more
of
a
pleasure
for
me,
and
rather
than
receiving
negative
criticisms,
I
started
to
receive
praise
and
positive
feedback
for
my
hard
work.
Not
surprisingly,
my
writing
abilities
began
to
improve
substantially
from
earlier
years,
and
I
found
myself
receiving
very
good
grades
in
my
English
classes.
During
high
school
is
when
I
experienced
major
changes
in
my
writing,
both
in
creative
aspects,
and
in
structured
writing
assignments.
This
was
also
besides
the
major
change
in
the
tool
used
for
writing,
as
I
began
to
use
a
computer
to
type
all
my
written
assignments,
rather
than
writing
them
out
with
pencil
in
various
drafts.
In
class
essays
or
assignments
were
still
often
written
in
pen,
though
was
usually
just
one
draft
instead
of
multiple
ones.
Along
with
the
change
in
tool
for
my
writing
came
a
huge
confidence
boost
from
receiving
positive
praise
and
reinforcement.
In
class
assignments,
which
usually
revolved
around
a
thesis
of
some
sort
by
comparing
two
novels,
began
to
be
more
structured,
and
I
finally
started
to
understand
how
to
create
the
layout
of
a
decent
essay.
With
a
more
favorable
attitude
towards
writing,
I
began
to
be
more
open
to
different
forms
of
writing,
including
poetry
and
short
stories.
Beginning
in
9th
grade,
I
started
to
explore
other
forms
of
creative
writing,
by
reading
and
writing
various
poems
and
short
stories.
High
school
was
a
time
when
kids
began
to
mature,
and
at
the
same
time,
feelings
and
emotions
were
often
plentiful.
With
this
combination,
I
began
to
try
writing
poems
about
various
feelings
I
had,
usually
concerning
love
or
religion.
As
I
was
new
to
this
form
of
writing,
I
was
fairly
shy
in
whom
to
show
them
to,
often
beginning
with
just
my
best
friend,
then
a
few
other
close
friends,
and
sometimes
even
showing
an
English
teacher
that
I
was
close
with.
Apparently,
people
really
liked
my
poetry,
as
I
started
to
receive
a
lot
of
positive
reinforcement,
which
lead
me
to
write
more
poems
over
the
course
of
my
high
school
career.
I
was
so
happy
with
writing
poems,
and
with
the
reactions
from
others
that
I
was
receiving,
that
sometimes
I
would
have
the
same
feeling
from
2nd
grade,
when
I
was
excited
to
see
the
reactions
of
my
readers.
In
11th
and
12th
grade,
I
began
to
be
more
confident
with
my
poems,
and
I
decided
to
submit
them
to
my
schoolOs
literary
magazine
and
newspaper.
Astonishingly,
both
the
newspaper
and
the
literary
magazine
decided
to
use
two
poems
of
mine
that
I
had
submitted,
and
I
was
soon
able
to
have
my
work
published
for
the
whole
school
to
see.
I
received
a
great
amount
of
praise
and
positive
feedback
from
peers,
teachers,
and
even
family,
who
was
the
last
party
I
showed
my
poetry
to.
Although
my
creative
writing
began
to
flourish,
and
my
structured
essays
still
received
good
grades
in
school,
I
was
unsure
of
how
ready
I
was
for
college
level
writing.
Upon
entering
college,
I
was
quite
unsure
of
how
my
writing
would
fare
against
the
new
standards
of
writing
and
reading,
which
were
very
quickly
established.
One
paper
per
week,
even
though
there
was
a
two-page
limit,
seemed
to
be
more
writing
than
I
had
ever
done
before.
Despite
this,
I
tried
my
hardest
on
every
paper
that
was
assigned
to
me,
sometimes
leading
to
an
A
or
A+,
and
sometimes
leading
to
a
B+.
At
the
same
time,
no
matter
what
grade
I
received,
there
was
always
positive
feedback
somewhere,
and
constructive
criticism
to
improve
my
writing
skills.
I
soon
learned
that
improving
my
writing
skills
would
be
a
great
new
goal
to
have;
the
key
difference
here
being
that
this
was
a
voluntary
goal,
rather
than
a
goal
set
by
past
teachers
or
requirements.
Although
my
first
writing
class
in
college
ended
with
a
B+
on
my
transcript,
I
felt
I
had
learned
a
lot
of
information
about
the
new
standards
of
writing
in
college,
and
I
knew
that
I
was
not
dead
meat
in
this
new
academic
environment.
Over
the
course
of
the
semesters
finished
at
Lafayette
College,
I
kept
at
writing
with
the
same
goal
as
my
first
semester
D
to
improve
upon
my
abilities
as
a
writer,
and
to
accurately
transcribe
my
thoughts
and
ideas
on
paper
so
that
the
reader
could
clearly
understand
the
goals
of
my
essays.
Writing
was
obviously
a
major
part
of
many
of
the
classes
at
Lafayette,
rather
than
being
a
common
theme
in
just
English
classes.
This
led
me
to
practice
writing
quite
often,
and
I
was
usually
satisfied
with
the
graded
results.
It
was
not
until
sophomore
year
of
college,
after
taking
my
English
110
class
that
I
began
to
become
confident
with
my
own
works.
I
was
not
only
receiving
very
good
grades
on
most
of
my
papers,
but
I
remember
receiving
a
great
amount
of
positive
reinforcement
and
feedback.
In
addition,
the
constructive
criticism
was
very
easy
to
understand
and
to
apply
to
my
future
works.
I
believe
my
writing
abilities
developed
most
strongly
in
this
course,
with
the
most
memorable
writing
assignment
being
a
midterm
project
about
a
novel
we
had
read
in
class.
The
novel,
and
topic
of
the
class
itself
was
something
I
was
passionate
about,
so
I
decided
to
devote
quite
a
few
days
to
writing
and
editing
my
paper
to
achieve
my
best
possible
work.
To
my
surprise,
the
paper
I
was
working
on,
which
was
in
mid-draft
process,
was
viewed
by
the
professor
and
was
given
little
criticism
at
all.
In
fact,
the
paper
was
good
enough
to
be
handed
in
as
a
final
product,
and
to
receive
an
A
for
doing
so.
This
event
was
probably
one
of
the
happiest
and
most
positive
experiences
as
a
writer,
as
I
had
seen
a
direct
relationship
between
the
amount
of
effort
and
work
I
put
into
a
paper,
to
the
quality
it
came
out
to
be.
From
this
point
on,
I
learned
and
felt
that
with
enough
effort
and
hard
work,
my
writing
abilities
would
allow
me
to
achieve
success
on
any
paper
assigned
to
me,
and
that
I
was
adequately
prepared
to
take
on
any
future
writing
endeavors
that
I
would
encounter
at
college
and
beyond.
While
looking
back
at
my
career
as
a
writer,
I
understand
that
all
the
steps
taken
lead
to
a
broader
understanding
of
writing
in
the
long
run.
Sometimes
our
writing
assignments
had
a
specific
purpose,
like
preparing
for
an
upcoming
exam,
while
other
times
there
was
a
much
looser
purpose.
In
my
own
case,
I
realize
that
much
of
my
attitude
and
outlook
towards
writing
over
the
past
years
depended
heavily
on
how
people
felt
about
my
writing.
Thankfully
IOve
received
a
surplus
of
reinforcement
and
positive
feedback
overall,
which
led
to
a
healthy
development
of
my
writing
skills,
and
to
a
happy
outlook
on
writing
as
a
whole.
