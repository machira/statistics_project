International
Writing
Experiences
Last
semester,
my
writing
experiences
were
distinctly
different
from
other
semesters
in
college
for
various
reasons.
All
of
the
differences
were
rooted
in
the
fact
that
I
was
on
a
semester
abroad
program.
First,
my
writing
process
was
significantly
affected
by
the
simple
fact
that
I
was
in
new
locations
with
many
more
distractions,
and
no
consistency.
Second,
the
professors
gave
assignments
that
had
almost
no
format,
length,
style,
or
content
guidelines,
which,
while
initially
was
nerve-wracking,
but
ultimately
positively
impacted
my
writing.
Last,
the
audience
was
different
in
that
my
professors
did
not
speak
English
as
a
first
language,
which
forced
me
to
write
more
clearly
and
more
simply,
again,
ultimately
improving
my
writing.
Many
of
the
changes
were
challenging,
but
I
gained
a
lot
of
experience
that
I
will
use
as
a
WA
and
as
a
writer.
I.
The
Writing
ProcessbvLocation,
Location,
Locationg
First,
being
abroad
affected
the
writing
process,
fundamentally
because
I
had
to
change
the
location
in
which
I
worked.
In
high
school,
I
did
all
of
my
homework
in
the
same
big
chair
in
my
family
room.
I
could
not
focus
any
where
else.
When
I
sat
there,
I
knew
it
was
vbusiness-timeg
and
I
would
start
to
work.
At
Lafayette,
I
only
ever
work
in
the
Skillman
Library.
I
choose
a
spot
that
is
as
quiet
as
possiblebI
can
not
help
but
to
glance
up
every
time
I
catch
a
movement
in
the
corner
of
my
eye,
so
I
have
no
choice
but
to
seclude
myself
as
much
as
possible.
The
rare
times
I
try
to
work
in
other
locations
(my
room,
the
wings
of
theater
during
rehearsal,
Farinon)
I
achieve
very
little
proportional
to
the
time
I
invested.
What
can
I
say?
I
am
a
creature
of
habit.
My
little
routines
have
allowed
me
to
juggle
rugby,
theater,
and
working
as
a
WA,
but
being
abroad
forced
me
to
adjust
my
routines.
On
my
program,
I
spent
the
first
month
in
the
Netherlands,
first
in
a
hostel,
then
with
a
family.
The
second
month
I
spent
traveling
to
four
other
countries,
during
which
time
I
stayed
in
four
different
hotels
and
two
different
families.
During
the
last
six
weeks
I
was
back
in
the
Netherlands,
but
again,
there
was
no
routine
or
consistencybI
lived
with
two
different
families
and
stayed
in
a
hostel
for
the
last
week.
Some
homes
had
children,
some
had
pets,
some
had
desks,
some
had
internet,
some
had
no
privacybthey
were
all
different
environments
to
work
in.
Some
homes
were
ideal
and
some
homes
were
challenging.
Between
homes
and
cities,
I
regularly
wrote
essays
and
papers
while
on
trains,
in
airports,
on
porches,
sitting
on
beds,
sitting
on
the
floor
of
hallways
(to
be
close
to
an
outlet),
in
cafs,
and
many
more
quiet
corners
and
nooks.
To
some
writers,
this
is
the
romantic
way
to
produce
good
writing.
I
found
it
frustrating.
The
first
time
I
realized
I
was
having
serious
trouble
concentrating
was
when
I
started
listening
to
music
while
I
wrote
to
drown
out
other
noise.
I
find
it
hard
to
organize
my
thoughts
with
music,
but
it
was
the
lesser
of
two
evilsba
sure
sign
I
was
struggling
to
focus.
The
family
that
I
spent
the
most
of
my
time
with
had
two
young
boys.
At
ages
4
and
7,
they
were
wild
little
guys
who
were
intensely
curious
as
to
what
I
was
up
to.
They
quickly
figured
out
that
my
computer
help
music
and
photos,
so
anytime
they
saw
me
working
they
would
jump
into
my
lap
and
ask
for
either
music
or
pictures.
They
would
look
at
me
with
big
eyes
and
missing-teeth-smiles,
and
with
a
big
sigh
and
a
disclaimer
of
only
five
minutes
of
entertainment,
I
would
agree.
After
the
five
(usually
ten,
or
fifteenShch)
minutes
were
up,
they
would
scamper
off
and
continue
their
typical
boy
shenanigans.
The
noise
they
made
never
bothered
me,
because
it
was,
as
I
called
it,
vhappy
noisesg.
All
the
yells,
shouts,
crashes
of
toys,
and
other
raucous
was
always
because
they
were
playing,
not
fighting.
But,
for
as
much
as
it
made
me
smile,
it
certainly
slowed
down
my
work.
All
these
distraction
changed
how
I
approached
my
work.
When
I
am
at
school,
I
have
to
keep
a
steady
pace
throughout
the
day
to
accomplish
everything
I
need
to
do.
While
abroad,
it
took
some
time
for
me
to
internalize
that
I
did
not
have
extracurricular
activities
and
appointments
waiting
for
me.
This
seems
a
bit
thick
of
me,
but
I
am
used
pushing
myself
to
write
papers
at
a
steady
pace.
I
had
to
accept
that
sometimes
when
I
sat
down
to
work,
I
might
have
a
burst
of
writing,
but
often
I
would
have
to
work
more
slowly
to
be
able
to
concentrate
in
the
midst
of
distractions.
It
was
oddly
difficult
to
accept
that
I
would
have
to
write
in
this
haphazard
rhythm,
but
once
I
did,
it
was
rather
liberating.
II.
The
AssignmentsbvLess
is
moreg
Last
semester,
not
only
was
my
writing
process
quite
different,
but
the
actual
assignments
were
different
from
what
I
was
used
to.
The
bulk
of
the
writing
assignments
came
towards
the
conclusion
of
the
courses.
For
each
course
we
wrote
a
final
paper.
We
were
given
a
one
page
document
with
a
vague
suggestion
of
length,
format,
structure,
and
number
of
sources.
We
were
told
that
these
directions
applied
to
all
four
final
papers,
and
that
they
were
actually
more
of
suggestions
than
strict
directions.
The
only
strict
part
was
that
we
use
1.5
spacing
(as
is
standard
in
Europe)
and
12
point
Times
New
Roman
Font.
When
we
asked
about
what
the
topics
should
be,
the
answer
was
vanything
relating
to
the
course.g
Other
questions
were
dismissed
as
frivolous:
Can
the
topics
overlap?
vSureShchwell,
not
too
muchShchI
donet
knowShchuse
your
judgment.g
Should
we
have
a
title
page?
vI
suppose.
I
donet
really
care.g
Our
Academic
Director
often
purposely
gave
us
vague
directions
and
answers
to
inspire
independence
in
everything
we
did.
We
always
ended
up
as
inspired,
independent
students,
but
our
initial
reaction
was
always
resistance
and
thinly
veiled
inward
panic.
We
probably
held
ourselves
to
a
higher
standard
of
quality
than
was
expected
of
us.
Without
very
much
direction,
we
were
more
motivated
to
fine
tune
our
paper
in
hopes
that
we
would
impress
our
audience.
Without
being
over-directed,
we
pushed
ourselves
harder
to
explore
and
analyze
our
thoughts
and
interests.
Maybe
that
is
a
lesson
more
Lafayette
professors
should
be
reminded
ofbsometimes,
less
is
more.
III.
The
AudiencebvAgain,
less
is
moreg
The
last
big
difference
between
writing
at
Lafayette
and
writing
on
this
abroad
program
was
that
the
audience
was
different.
Of
course,
at
Lafayette,
every
professor
I
have
is
different
because
of
different
academic
disciplines,
particular
assignments,
personal
styles,
and
goals
of
the
class,
so
I
am
used
to
a
certain
level
of
variation
between
my
audiences.
While
abroad,
not
one
of
my
professors
spoke
English
as
a
first
languageba
change
that
I
was
not
accustomed
to.
At
first,
the
other
students
and
I
joked
that
this
would
be
great,
because
we
would
not
have
to
worry
so
much
in
the
editing
phase.
Of
course,
once
we
started
writing,
we
realized
that
we
actually
now
had
a
bigger
burden
to
write
as
clearly
as
possible.
No
longer
would
excessively
fancy
words
and
stiff
academic
terms
impress
our
readers.
Long
sentences
that
jammed
in
several
separate
thoughts
were
particularly
confusing
to
our
professors.
Once
again,
I
was
reminded
that
less
is
often
more.
Simpler,
clearer
writing
actually
reflect
higher
quality
work
and
ability
as
a
writer.
Unnecessary
language
and
overly
complicated
sentences
are
actually
not
that
impressive.
IV.
Moving
Forward
All
these
new
writing
experiences
will
certainly
affect
me
as
both
a
writer
and
as
a
WA.
Having
so
many
different
work
spaces
and
distractions
while
abroad,
allowed
me
to
prove
to
myself
that
I
could
focus,
even
without
my
usual
routines
and
locations.
That
said,
it
also
made
me
appreciate
how
helpful
having
a
routine
is.
If
I
have
a
student
next
semester
who
is
struggling
to
keep
up
with
the
amount
of
work,
I
will
take
the
time
to
discuss
with
them
where
they
get
most
of
their
work
done.
I
will
ask
where
they
are
most
productivebWith
music?
In
the
library?
In
a
study
group?
In
a
caf?
At
a
particular
part
of
the
day?
I
will
try
to
get
my
students
to
reflect
on
their
study
habit,
because
they
might
notice
that
some
situations
are
far
more
productive
than
others.
In
the
past,
this
is
an
issue
I
had
not
addressed
with
my
students,
but
moving
forward,
I
would
like
to
pay
attention
to
how
work
environments
can
affect
the
writing
process.
My
experience
with
very
differently
styled
assignments
last
semester
taught
me
a
lot
about
student-professor
interactions
in
writing.
Having
so
little
direction
for
my
assignments
reminded
me
to
write
for
myselfbchoose
at
topic
I
am
interested
in;
choose
a
flow
and
style
that
fits
what
I
want
to
say;
and,
work
on
it
until
the
quality
is
as
high
as
I
want
it
to
be.
I
want
to
use
that
experience
to
encourage
students
to
focus
more
on
themselves
than
their
professor
when
writing.
More
specifically,
I
want
to
point
out
to
them
that
when
the
students
on
my
program
were
given
so
little
direction,
we
actually
all
turned-in
papers
that
were
above
and
beyond
the
quality
and
depth
that
our
professors
were
expecting.
That
said,
I
will
not
forget
the
inward
panic
I
felt
when
I
saw
how
little
direction
I
was
being
given.
I
want
to
make
sure
I
do
not
dismiss
the
concern
of
my
students,
but
instead
empathize
with
their
worries.
Having
professors
who
spoke
English
as
a
second
or
third
language
reminded
me
to
keep
my
writing
clear
and
simple.
Many
students,
myself
included,
are
sometimes
seduced
by
flowery,
academic
rhetoric
and
long,
complex
sentences
that
sound
impressive
if
read
out
loud.
In
fact,
as
I
experienced
while
abroad,
writing
in
a
simple,
clear
way,
is
more
effective
in
many
ways.
It
forces
the
writer
to
edit,
edit,
and
edit
again,
which
refines
their
ideas.
Also,
it
guides
the
reader
better
and
allows
highly
complex
ideas
to
be
communicated
easily.
I
want
to
remember
this
not
only
for
my
own
writing,
but
also
for
my
WA
students.
I
will
continue
to
encourage
my
students
to
be
clear
and
concise
in
their
writing.
All
these
experiences
in
writing
abroad
have
put
many
of
my
Lafayette
writing
experiences
in
new
light.
I
think
these
experiences
will
have
a
positive
impact
on
my
future
endeavors,
both
as
a
writer
and
as
a
WA.
