It's
the
End
of
the
World
As
We
Know
It!
Returning
WA
Assignment
08/28/98
A
feeling
of
absolute
terror
settled
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
as
I
reached
the
landing
on
the
second
floor
of
South
College.
My
apprehension
increased
as
I
walked
through
the
mild
humidity
toward
Pardee
and
room
316.1
sank
into
a
chair
and
nervously
shuffled
my
stack
of
papers,
reviewed
my
notes
and
wondered
for
the
umpteenth
time,
"What
were
they
thinking?"
Before
I
could
work
myself
into
a
cold
sweat,
a
guy
walked
in
the
door,
surveyed
the
scene
before
him
and
assumed
the
look
of
a
lost
puppy.
At
that
point
I
remembered
that
my
fear
equaled
that
of
my
pathetic
looking
peer
and
anything
I
said
to
him
would
be
better
than
the
fate
worse
than
death
he
obviously
imagined.
My
apprehension
did
not
evaporate
but
I
remembered
my
nervousness
a
year
earlier
at
my
first
WA
meeting.
I
was
determined
the
embody
the
same
sense
of
safety
and
respect
in
my
own
"class"
that
my
first
WA
invoked
for
me.
My
first
WA
assignment
was
for
the
FYS
class
I
had
completed
the
previous
year.
I
was
good
friends
with
the
professor
and
had
the
"home-court
advantage."
I
already
completed
the
assignments
and
read
her
comments.
I
also
knew
her
pet
peeves
and
expectations.
Thankfully,
she
was
extremely
involved
in
the
class
and
an
avid
supporter
of
the
WA
program.
She
defined
her
needs
and
was
constantly
available
for
consultation.
Her
previous
experiences
teaching
FYS
resulted
in
an
understanding
that
much
of
what
a
WA
does
for
freshman
in
the
first
few
conferences
is
act
as
an
interpreter
and
cheerleader.
She
had
no
false
illusions
that
my
suggestions
would
enable
students
to
write
senior
thesis
papers.
I
found
freshmen
usually
require
reassurance
that
their
ideas
are
valid
and
important.
Working
with
freshman
helped
me
realize
that
very,
very
seldom
does
a
college
student
discover
a
truly
original
idea.
Instead,
the
quality
of
a
paper
is
determined
by
the
angle
taken
toward
the
idea
and
the
depth
of
analysis.
My
writing
benefited
enormously
from
this
knowledge.
I
stopped
beating
my
brains
out
trying
to
find
an
unexplored
idea.
Instead,
I
realized
previously
accomplished
research
validated
my
focus.
The
ability
to
reference
outside
sources
backing
my
arguments
was
both
impressive
and
sharpened
my
research
skills.
I
learned
new
ways
to
utilize
resources
such
as
the
internet
and
footnotes
in
articles.
Often
an
article
related
to
a
topic
I
was
researching
yielded
little
useful
information
but
a
footnote
referenced
an
article
that
fit
my
needs
like
a
puzzle
piece.
As
a
result,
I
found
myself
in
the
situation
of
cutting
out
excessive
information
and
sorting
through
dozens
of
articles
to
clarify
and
define
my
ideas.
The
recognition
of
this
type
of
resource
allowed
my
suggestions
to
my
FYS
students
to
"do
more
research"
to
become
less
intimidating.
Usually
by
the
time
I
read
a
draft
the
students
assumed
their
research
was
done
and
the
focus
was
simply
structural
improvements.
Initial
reactions
to
my
questions
that
required
further
investigation
ranged
from
eye
rolling
to
a
pleading
look
I
immediately
recognized
as
the,
"is
this
really
necessary"
expression.
My
questions
also
usually
invoked
frustration.
The
frustration
stemmed
from
the
students'
certainty
they
had
exhausted
all
available
resources,
including
the
librarians.
It
was
wonderful
to
show
students
that
additional
research
could
take
the
form
of
articles
already
referenced
in
their
previous
research.
It
was
also
helpful
as
a
reference
tool
for
my
second
semester
class
of
senior
engineers
writing
fifty
page
term
papers.
After
collecting
the
materials
on
their
companies
many
were
convinced
they
could
not
possibly
have
missed
a
shred
of
information.
Once
I
could
see
copies
of
their
research,
it
was
easy
to
point
them
to
further
available
information.
Professors
generally
find
referenced
information
valuable
and
educational.
However,
I
learned
early
on
that
information
and
even
good
writing
are
only
responsible
for
part
of
the
grade
earned.
Professors
have
definite
ideas
about
crucial
information
in
a
paper.
Often
they
form
a
checklist,
mental
or
otherwise,
of
criteria
for
a
successful
paper.
A
student
can
include
all
the
information
in
an
alternative
form
and
if
the
professor
does
not
recognize
it
the
paper
is
doomed.
I
spend
much
of
my
WA
time
acting
as
an
interpreter
for
assignments.
I
asked
both
the
professor
and
the
students
to
explain
the
purpose
and
essential
elements
of
the
paper.
Often
the
two
viewpoints
failed
to
run
on
parallel
tracks.
It
became
my
responsibility
to
either
emphasis
areas
the
professor
expected
or
to
ask
the
students
to
request
a
better
explanation.
I
found
my
FYS
professor
often
gave
detailed,
step-by-step
instructions
that
she
expected
to
be
followed.
Students'
difficulties
with
fulfilling
her
requirements
originated
simply
from
their
failure
to
read
the
assignment
thoroughly
and
continue
rereading
it
through
the
course
of
their
writing.
The
constant
need
to
remind
students
to
read
the
assignment
made
me
more
conscious
of
instructions
I
received
in
my
courses.
Reading
the
assignments
thoroughly
resulted
in
the
ability
to
ask
INTELLIGENT
questions
for
clarification.
This
yielded
better
relationships
with
my
professors
and
undoubtedly
higher
grades
on
papers.
I
recognized
the
importance
of
asking
questions
more
with
my
senior
engineers.
The
professor
did
not
cement
his
ideas
on
structure
and
details
until
after
reading
the
students
initial
drafts.
This
resulted
in
more
complete
instructions
arriving
after
twenty
pages
were
already
completed.
Many
students
rewrote
entire
chapters
multiple
times
following
revisions
of
instructions.
This
was
frustrating
for
the
students
and
invalidated
many
of
my
comments
on
organization
and
depth.
Toward
the
end
of
the
semester,
I
began
asking
the
professor
for
clarification
after
his
reading
and
before
my
meetings
with
the
students.
This
allowed
me
to
focus
my
energy
on
areas
that
would
likely
remain
in
the
same
format.
It
also
helped
me
generate
useful
questions
and
suggestions
for
areas
to
be
rewritten.
Knowing
before
the
conference
what
areas
required
rewriting
increased
my
confidence.
When
students
arrived
I
knew
my
comments
were
applicable.
The
uncertainty
and
inherent
shyness
that
result
from
critic
of
a
peers'
work
were
lessened
by
the
assurance
that
my
focus
was
well
based.
The
worst
feeling
is
entering
a
conference
without
confidence
in
and
rationalization
for
my
suggestions.
On
the
flip
side,
as
a
student,
I
detest
going
to
a
conference
when
I
feel
my
WA
is
uninformed.
I
find
it
insulting
as
a
writer
to
have
a
WA
unfamiliar
with
the
focus
of
the
assignment.
That
type
of
conference
can
be
useful
for
grammatical
and
general
writing
errors
but
is
of
little
assistance
with
ideas,
presentation,
focus
and
organization.
Either
circumstance
is
a
waste
of
both
participants'
time
and
energy.
Part
of
the
difficulty
with
being
WA
was
unfamiliarity
with
the
topics
discussed.
I
had
no
engineering
background
and
engaging
senior
engineering
students
as
a
sophomore
economics
and
government
double
major
was
intimidating.
Thankfully,
the
course
was
a
business
engineering
course.
Consequently,
the
information
presented
was
familiar
in
format
and
the
resulting
conclusions
understandable.
It
did,
however,
lend
a
different
focus
from
the
typical
business
or
economic
analysis.
I
understood
for
the
first
time
the
very
real
distinctions
between
expectations
from
different
departments.
I
realized
the
invaluable
resource
of
friends
in
different
majors.
When
I
came
across
something
I
did
not
fully
understand
in
one
of
my
students'
papers,
or
an
expectation
presented
in
one
of
my
classes,
I
began
asking
my
friends
for
clarification.
Many
of
my
senior
engineers
engaged
the
aid
of
their
peers
majoring
in
economics
for
help
with
corporate
analysis
and
predication
of
future
activities
by
their
company
of
choice.
This
type
of
interaction
was
doubly
beneficial.
First,
it
helped
the
engineering
students
gain
greater
understanding
through
a
kind
of
cross
training
in
a
less
stressful
situation.
Secondly,
it
gave
them
an
educated
audience
for
trial
presentation.
Cross
training
came
in
handy
in
my
writing
during
my
VAST
course
spring
semester.
As
an
economics
and
government
major
my
exposure
to
the
sciences
is
limited.
My
VAST
heavily
emphasized
human
biology
and
thankfully
my
previous
roommate
was
a
biology
major
with
a
concentration
in
physical
therapy.
When
I
researched
papers
and
did
not
understand
the
details
in
an
article
she
explained
in
simpler
terms.
She
also
had
access
to
additional
research
and
resources.
Finally,
she
acted
as
an
educated
sounding
board
for
my
ideas
and
conclusions.
Her
input
was
invaluable.
This
type
of
help
enabled
me
to
focus
my
presentation
and
added
depth
to
my
papers.
As
a
result
of
asking
questions
of
my
roommate,
I
learned
how
to
ask
questions
that
truly
expanded
my
writing.
Understanding
questions
to
ask
benefited
my
relationship
with
my
WA
and
with
my
students.
I
found
that
given
the
appropriate
question
meetings
with
my
WA
were
more
productive.
Instead
of
asking
for
a
general
analysis,
I
broke
my
paper
down
to
defined
ideas
for
suggestions,
questions
and
approval.
This
made
the
paper
less
daunting
to
correct
and
my
revisions
easier.
The
ability
to
assign
particular
suggestions
to
bounded
areas
often
resulted
in
deeper
questioning
and
consequently,
better
backing
for
my
conclusions.
In
addition,
it
enabled
the
relationship
between
my
WA
and
I
to
exist
more
comfortably.
The
feeling
of
inferiority
that
often
accompanies
suggestions
from
a
WA
decreased
dramatically.
Our
conversation
took
the
tone
of
educated
participants
in
a
debate.
This
highlighted
weak
areas
in
my
arguments
as
well
as
explored
new
angles.
It
also
resulted
in
my
questioning
the
suggestions
of
my
WA.
I
then
understood
the
reason
for
the
changes
I
was
making
or
choosing
not
to
make.
I
found
my
revision
process
became
more
efficient
and
focused
when
I
understood
the
goal
of
the
suggested
changes.
Following
my
revelation
concerning
the
correct
questions,
I
was
able
to
create
a
better
formula
for
suggesting
changes
to
my
students.
Instead
of
creating
a
mess
of
corrections
that
ran
the
paper's
train
of
thought,
I
tried
to
identify
the
writer's
ideas.
I
found
the
most
effective
method
was
explaining
to
the
writer
what
I
gleaned
as
the
thesis
and
focus
ideas.
I
then
described
the
conclusions
I
came
too.
This
opened
discussions
j^bout
how
to
most
effectively
present
ideas,
what
exactly
the
author
was
attempting
to
say
and
cemented
agreement
on
the
paper's
weakest
sections.
This
approach
largely
avoided
the
disjointed,
silted
conversations
that
result
from
one
sided
bombardment
by
the
WA.
The
process
became
less
overwhelming
and
more
interactive.
It
enabled
the
writer
to
direct
the
conversation
to
their
focus
areas.
Writer's
know
the
weakest
points
of
their
papers
and
given
the
opportunity
I
found
most
chose
to
enlist
my
aid
on
that
area.
The
approach
I
just
summarized
requires
a
level
of
trust
and
comfort
between
the
student
and
the
WA.
As
a
writer
I
always
feel
more
at
ease
when
I
know
my
WA
remembers
at
least
some
detail
of
my
paper
that
distinguishes
it
from
others
s/he
read.
As
a
WA
I
understand
fully
the
difficulty
remembering
each
person's
paper
when
reading
fifteen
to
twenty
papers
on
the
same
or
similar
topics.
In
an
attempt
to
make
my
students
feel
as
though
I
realized
that
each
paper
was
unique,
I
adopted
a
system
that
my
first
WA
used.
My
first
experience
with
my
WA
was
incredibly
positive
and
I
knew
that
he
was
familiar
with
my
paper
as
an
individual
work.
He
was
always
able
to
mention
a
few
specific
characteristics
of
the
paper;
he
kept
a
sheet
of
notes
that
he
took
when
he
first
reviewed
the
paper.
I
found
the
most
effective
method
for
reviewing
my
students'
papers
was
to
allot
approximately
20
minutes
to
a
half-hour
for
each
student's
paper
(depending
on
the
length)
and
take
notes
on
ideas,
initial
impressions
and
thoughts.
This
allowed
me
to
record
my
questions
as
they
arouse
and
created
a
guideline
for
suggestions
on
organization.
It
also
resulted
in
comments
distinct
to
the
paper
enabling
me
to
view
it
as
a
unique
piece
of
writing
versus
one
of
several
in
a
class.
Not
only
do
I
find
myself
asking
more
insightful
questions
using
this
method,
but
students
seem
to
respond
well.
The
past
years
writing
experiences
have
re-enforced
that
my
skills
are
a
work
in
progress.
My
greatest
improvement
was
not
in
my
initial
drafts
or
writing
style.
Instead,
I
focused
on
examining
my
revision
process
and
asking
the
questions
that
make
the
process
more
effective.
I
waste
less
time
discussing
general
overwhelming
suggestions
with
my
WA.
I
try
to
enter
the
meelmg
with
a
few
ideas
for
improvement
and
discuss
areas
that
I
feel
are
murky.
This
opens
a
dialogue-allowing
my
writing
to
be
clearer
to
a
larger
audience.
Instead
of
feeling
trapped
by
the
assignment,
I
find
that
debate
sparks
expansion
of
ideas
and
clarity
of
arguments
