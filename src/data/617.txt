NThe

In
light
of
the
inarguable
link
between
thought
process
and
writing,
my
writing
history
involves
mostly
my
transformation
from
an
adventurous
young
girl,
imagining
beyond
her
immediate
surroundings,
to
an
adventurous
young
woman,
entering,
somewhat
ill-equipped,
into
academia.
As
for
the
writing
product,
I
suppose
the
tentative
ending
is
unavoidably
exposed
by
the
nature
of
this
essay,
but
perhaps
more
interesting
is
the
process
by
which
my
vocabulary,
focus,
and
style
have
been
sculpted
by
my
environment.
The
earliest
memories
I
have
of
writing
involve
a
series
of
short
adventure
stories
about
my
default
protagonists,
aptly
named
Mary
and
Ann.
Mary
and
Ann
would
either
encounter
princesses
much
like
those
in
my
storybooks
or
take
bike
rides
along
a
trail
much
like
the
one
my
family
frequented.
Occasionally,
a
teacher
named
NMiss
Marcia,O
who
happened
to
share
my
motherOs
name,
would
even
visit
the
girls.
These
tales,
rooted
in
my
personal
experiences
and
nurtured
by
sprints
of
my
imagination,
would
captivate
my
mind
and
my
tongue
as
I
traced
my
parents
and
brothers
around
the
house
divulging
the
latest
twists
in
the
plots.
I
remember
one
story
particularly
vividly:
Mary
and
Ann
were
out
on
a
leisurely
bike
ride
one
day
when
their
bikes
suddenly
and
simultaneously
broke
down.
They
were
further
devastated
when
they
saw
that
the
mile
marker
adjoining
the
trail
read
N50
milesO
on
both
sides.
Seeing
that
nightfall
was
nearing,
Mary,
being
well
taught
in
survival
techniques
and
always
mentally
collected
and
prepared,
spearheaded
the
building
of
a
fire
and
a
makeshift
shelter.
Just
as
the
girls
were
settling
down,
Ann
spotted
a
shadowy
silhouette
in
the
distance.
Not
knowing
whether
it
was
an
unwelcomed
stranger,
a
bear,
or
some
other
monstrosity,
the
girls
were
understandably
fear-stricken.
Just
as
the
figure
was
upon
themNrelief
ensued.
It
was
only
the
girlsO
brother,
familiarly
named
Nick,
followed
by
the
rest
of
the
NfictionalO
family
arriving
for
the
rescue.
I
remember
my
delight
when
my
father
gave
me
a
pre-bound
booklet
of
around
fifteen
fantastically
blank
pages
to
transform
this
plot
into
a
real
book,
cover
and
all.
Heeding
my
motherOs
words
of
caution,
I
painstakingly
scratched
out
each
letter
and
drew
each
illustration
in
pencil
first
to
doubly
insure
the
best
showing
of
my
final
copyNat
least
for
the
first
five
pages.
However
insignificant
the
ramblings
of
a
five
year
old
appear,
some
very
important
attributes
of
my
writing
and
self
were
beginning
to
manifest.
I
was
subconsciously
mastering
the
technique
of
incorporating
my
lifeOs
experiences
and
interests
into
my
fictional
plot
and
augmenting
it
with
the
fascinations
of
my
imagination,
while
modeling
the
significant
structural
components
of
the
literature
I
admired.
The
absence
of
subtlety,
most
poignantly
the
use
of
names
of
immediate
family
members
and
myself,
nicely
highlights
such
characteristics.
Slightly
less
pronounced
are
the
development
of
the
characters,
plot,
and
the
setting.
The
protagonists
exhibit
the
qualities
I
valued
in
myself
at
that
ageNcompetence,
sense
of
adventure,
and
bravery.
Hidden
in
the
plot
is
also
my
view
of
the
role
of
the
family
during
an
outdoor
adventure
setting.
Much
like
in
real
life,
where
my
parents
allowed
me
to
discover,
explore,
or
make
and
fix
my
own
mistakes
while
keeping
close
vigil
during
bike
rides,
hiking,
or
kayaking,
the
girls
remained
self
sufficient
in
their
own
adventure,
but
at
the
moment
of
pending
real
danger,
the
family
appears.
The
plot
development
also
mimics
the
familiar
rhetorical
template,
NOne
DayEwhen
suddenlyEto
make
matters
worseEoh
no!...but
it
was
onlyEhappily
ever
after,O
often
utilized
in
childrenOsO
books
to
teach
FreytagOs
elements
of
exposition,
rising
action,
climax,
falling
action,
and
resolution.
Furthermore,
the
care
and
patience,
so
uncharacteristic
of
adolescents,
that
I
exhibited
is
directly
proportional
to
the
pride
and
ownership
I
felt
towards
my
work.
This,
along
with
reinforcement
from
my
parents,
prompted
effort
towards
the
continuation
of
the
cycle
of
hard
work,
pride,
and
praise.
My
reading
preferences
and
practices
also
became
entwined
in
this
cyclic
pattern.
My
competitive
nature
ensured
me
that,
if
my
two
older
brothers
by
eight
and
three
years
could
tackle
a
novel,
then
there
was
no
decent
explanation
why
I
could
not.
I
recall
an
extemporaneous
test
devised
by
my
mother
to
prevent
me
from
starting
books
exceedingly
above
my
reading
level
and
quitting,
discouraged,
within
thirty
pages.
We
would
open
to
a
random
page
within
a
novel,
and
she
would
listen
as
I
read
it
aloud.
If,
on
that
one
page,
there
were
more
than
three
words
that
I
could
not
define
when
cued,
the
book
would
return
to
the
shelf
until
the
next
time
I
felt
capable.
I
developed
a
strong
affinity
for
my
Nchallenge
books,O
and
continued
choosing
literature
at
the
forefront
of
my
vocabulary
throughout
middle
school
and
almost
exclusively
cannon
works
throughout
high
school.
This
behavior
directly
influenced
my
writing.
After
looking
up
word
after
word
in
the
dictionary
to
struggle
painstakingly
through
the
novels,
my
vocabulary
began
to
mushroom,
and
definitions
became
a
sort
of
game.
At
the
dinner
table,
for
instance,
the
conversation
would
digress
to
some
question
or
disagreement
about
the
use
or
definition
of
a
particular
word.
I
remember
scatting
a
short
Jeopardy-esque
melody,
which
became
the
Ndefinition
gameO
theme
song,
as
I
jaunted
to
the
den
and
snatched
the
enormous,
and
seemingly
ancient,
Unabridged
Random
House
Dictionary,
my
fatherOs
graduation
present,
and
divulged
the
final
verdict.
Each
new
word
found
its
way,
often
misused,
into
my
next
writing
assignment,
even
if
it
meant
opening
a
reflection
about
the
sixth
gradeOs
world
cultures
unit
with
a
clause
like,
NJust
when
students
got
lackadaisical
about
schoolworkE.O
Along
with
my
newly
discovered
vocabulary,
my
knowledge
of
sentence
structure,
style,
and
writing
in
general,
came
mostly
from
my
personal
readings.
I
remember
reading
two
Nproject
books,O
The
Scarlet
Letter
and
A
Tale
of
Two
Cities,
the
same
time
as
my
mother.
As
one
of
us
came
across
a
particularly
poignant
sentence
or
beautiful
description,
the
other
would
be
summoned
to
share
and
discuss.
Within
school,
this
influence
manifested
itself
in
my
writing.
My
book
reports
and
other
forms
of
literary
criticism,
which
seemed
to
encompass
ninety-nine
percent
of
writing
assignments,
often
mimicked
the
style
of
the
subject.
When
I
wrote
about
Dickens
or
Hawthorne,
my
sentences
were
highly
descriptive
and
lengthy
with
multiple
clauses;
with
Camus
or
Vonnegut,
they
were
shorter,
more
suggestive,
and
pregnant.
Despite
my
oscillations
between
writing
style,
all
of
my
writings
received
the
same
sort
of
responses
and
grades
from
my
teachersNperfect
scores,
smiley
faces,
and
glowing
remarks.
Whether
I
poured
hours
of
work
and
thought
into
a
piece
or
followed
my
more
standard
routine
of
jotting
down
my
paper
the
period
before,
I
rarely
received
negative
criticism
at
school.
At
home,
on
the
other
hand,
my
mother
always
had
plenty
to
say.
Even
though
I
was
inwardly
disappointed
and
outwardly
argumentative
towards
her
critiques,
I
respected
her
opinion
because
it
was
always
truthful,
if
not
particularly
padded,
and
I
continued
sharing
my
writing
with
her.
Needless
to
say,
most
of
my
development
as
a
writer
took
place
at
home.
As
high
school
progressed,
I
began
incurring
more
writing
outlets.
Personally,
my
stream-of-consciousness,
screenplay,
and
poetry
filled
journal
provided
an
outlet
for
emotional
or
psychological
distresses
and
coming-of-age
confusion.
More
therapeutic
than
rhetorically
sound,
this
writing
consisted
of
the
genres
rarely
assigned
in
and
the
subject
matter
too
intimate
for
school.
I
still
have
yet
to
share
this
writing
with
anyone,
because
its
purpose
was
never
a
polished
product,
but
rather
originally
an
introspective
remedial
exercise
and
currently
a
time
capsule
to
my
emotional
and
developmental
state
at
that
time.
Publically,
my
deluge
of
extracurricular
activities
and
leadership
positions
lead
me
to
write
countless
speeches.
In
Mock
Trial
closings,
Student
Congress
bill
affirmations
or
negations,
forensic
speeches,
student
government
student
body
addresses,
I
found
my
niche
in
this
highly
verbal
and
persuasive
means
of
communication.
I
began
writing
and
speaking
about
concepts
that
drove
me
to
closely
analyze
and
develop
the
best
possible
configurations
of
word,
facial
expressions,
and
inflections.
The
excitement
I
felt
with
the
realization
that
I
was
quite
effective
in
my
attempts
and
the
recognition
by
my
judges,
teachers,
and
opponents
amplified
the
aforementioned
fundamental
cycle
of
hard
work,
pride,
and
praise.
My
junior
year
of
high
school,
after
placing
within
the
top
twenty-four
in
my
division
at
the
National
Catholic
Forensics
League
tournaments
my
freshman
and
sophomore
years,
I
decided
to
tackle
a
personally
passionate
issue
in
the
persuasive
original
oratory
category.
My
speech
dealt
with
the
1970s
Infant
Formula
Controversy,
during
which
the
World
Health
Organization
reprimanded
infant
formula
corporations
for
using
covert
and
manipulative
advertising
techniques
to
convince
impoverished
third
world
mothers
to
use
breast
milk
substitutes,
which,
because
of
the
unsanitary
water
and
poverty,
often
lead
to
unnecessary
disease
or
death
of
infants.
Despite
the
World
Health
OrganizationOs
Code,
similar
practices
began
occurring
within
the
Hispanic
Community
in
the
United
States
thirty
years
later.
The
local
response
to
my
speech
was
unexpected.
Many
of
my
peers
giggled
or
scoffed
at
the
mentioning
of
breast
milk,
and
a
speech
competition
judge
made
audible
sounds
of
disapproval
at
such
words,
wrote
on
my
comment
sheet
that
my
topic
was
inappropriate,
and
ranked
all
my
opponents,
including
the
girl
who
forgot
the
second
half
of
her
speech
on
how
smiling
was
preferable
to
frowning,
higher.
Conversely,
I
spent
only
the
hour
or
two
prior
to
my
high
school
graduation
ceremony
composing
my
speech.
In
my
estimation,
it
was
nothing
beyond
a
template
that
could
be
delivered
at
any
high
school
anywhere
if
the
proper
school
name
was
inserted.
The
reaction
from
the
audience
was
all
cheers
and
smiles.
My
always
honest
mother,
however,
described
it
best
saying,
NIs
bland
the
right
word?O
Since
general
comment
had
become
less
important
to
me,
the
aforementioned
events
sparked
more
excitement
for
college
rather
than
disappointment
at
unrecognized
effort.
However,
along
with
this
eagerness
for
college
classes
came
doubt
in
my
ability
to
compete
at
the
collegiate
level.
During
my
First
Year
Seminar,
while
still
filling
some
specific
gaps
in
my
writing
knowledge,
I
was
thrilled
to
find
an
emphasis
on
the
idea
driving
the
organization,
rhetoric,
and
other
elements
of
a
paper.
The
class
discussion
of
literature
and
political
issues
began
to
quench
the
yearnings
I
had
felt
throughout
high
school
for
such
passionate
academic
discussion.
Specifically,
and
poignantly
contrasted
to
my
prior
experiences,
when
I
chose
the
Infant
Formula
Controversy
as
my
controversial
issue
for
an
assignment,
my
classmates
and
professor
were
interested
to
learn
more.
The
most
beneficial
element
of
my
First
Year
Seminar
was
the
meaningful
feedback.
I
welcomed
all
criticism
because
it
was
a
constant
illumination
of
why
my
writing
was
never
as
good
as
writers
I
admired.
Although
I
often
inwardly
cursed
my
high
school
education
in
my
math
and
science
courses,
I
realized
that,
while
my
high
school
did
not
prepare
me
to
rattle
off
lists
of
polyatomic
ions
or
nuances
of
specific
citation
styles,
its
lack
of
rigor
allowed
me
time
instead
to
learn
and
develop
ideas
on
my
own
or
through
extracurricular
activities
about
people
and
the
world.
I
hypothesize
that
having
had
a
rich
childhood
to
develop
an
imagination,
despite
having
to
catch
up
in
math
and
science
courses
and
on
a
few
specific
conventions,
will
eventually
be
far
more
beneficial.
Upon
choosing
my
engineering
major,
I
remember
worrying
I
would
lose
touch
with
my
past
experiences
writing,
and
with
my
future
writing
aspirations.
I
fortunately
have
been
able
to
schedule
a
course
requiring
writing
each
semester
at
Lafayette,
and
am
now
thankful
to
have
the
Writing
Associate
Program
to
continue
developing
as
a
writer
and
thinker
and
to
spread
my
own
enthusiasm
about
the
art.
At
college,
I
continue
to
be
fascinated
with
finding
those
perfect
descriptive
words
as
I
was
around
the
dinner
table,
and
I
still,
at
times,
write
from
the
fascinations
of
my
imagination
as
when
I
was
five.
The
difference,
however,
is
the
best
and
most
rewarding
element
of
my
writing
education
thus
far.
Friends
at
Lafayette
or
from
back
home,
family,
and
even
my
mom
have
begun
sending
me
their
papers
to
read
and
discuss.
