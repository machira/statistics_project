My
History
as
a
Writer
I
did
not
think
my
memory
would
be
the
most
accurate
resource
with
which
to
examine
my
history
as
a
writer.
After
all,
I
can
hardly
remember
what
I
did
yesterday.
Luckily
I
knew
just
where
to
look
to
get
my
mind
thinking
back
to
about
fourteen
years
ago.
The
bottom
right-hand
drawer
of
the
dresser
in
my
room
is
like
a
time
capsule
filled
with
a
variety
of
pieces
of
writing
from
my
elementary
years.
I
will
admit
that
I
have
a
bad
habit
of
wanting
to
save
almost
everything
that
manages
to
pass
through
my
hands,
but,
in
this
case,
my
bad
habit
proved
quite
useful.
I
began
digging
through
the
papers,
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
look
for
but
just
pulling
out
different
pieces
as
I
came
across
them.
I
was
drawn
to
the
ones
written
in
pencil
on
the
blue
lines
of
faded
yellow
paper.
I
remembered
that
type
of
paper
from
my
elementary
school
days
and
knew
this
material
would
jog
my
memory.
Looking
over
the
papers
was
like
taking
a
trip
back
in
time
and
offered
me
a
glimpse
into
my
early
experiences
of
writing.
This
process
prompted
me
to
think
more
about
how
each
experience
with
writing
has
helped
me
to
grow
into
the
writer
I
am
today.
My
earliest
memories
of
writing,
although
difficult
to
recall
in
detail,
are
happy
ones.
After
learning
the
alphabet
and
how
to
print
the
letters
in
first
grade,
by
second
and
third
we
practiced
writing
mainly
by
writing
creative
stories.
Although
I
probably
did
not
appreciate
it
at
the
time,
the
freedom
to
write
with
the
only
limits
being
those
of
my
imagination
was
what
really
made
writing
enjoyable
to
me.
It
did
not
seem
like
a
chore
to
me
then,
but
rather
more
like
a
fun
activity
that
I
would
do
at
home
when
I
was
bored.
We
were
often
given
a
theme,
such
as
to
write
about
a
certain
animal,
compose
a
"tall
tale",
or
incorporate
certain
adjectives,
but
we
were
given
all
freedom
beyond
that.
It
was
these
first
experiences
that
sparked
my
love
of
writing.
I
have
always
found
writing
satisfying
because
of
the
creativity
it
allows.
Subjects
like
math
and
science
I
found
less
interesting
because
it
was
all
facts
and
formulas
to
be
learned
and
memorized.
Writing
was
something
that
required
the
contribution
of
my
own
thoughts
and
ideas,
and
this
concept
was
much
more
appealing
to
me.
When
I
read
the
stories
I
used
to
write,
I
see
that
I
typically
modeled
a
certain
character
after
myself.
This
may
have
been
done
subconsciously
or
consciously,
as
in
one
piece
in
which
I
cleverly
disguised
the
true
identity
of
the
character
by
calling
her
by
my
middle
name,
Lyn.
I
can
tell
by
my
use
of
names
of
relatives
and
childhood
friends
that
other
characters
were
modeled
after
people
I
knew.
This
shows
me
that
I
liked
to
write
about
life
and
people
and
things
that
were
important
to
me.
Even
then,
I
was
capable
of
grasping
the
knowledge
that
writing
was
something
very
personal.
It
was
something
I
could
create
and
own,
exclusively.
Even
though
my
words
would
be
shared
with
other
readers,
the
meaning
and
voice
behind
them
was
mine
alone.
A
treasured
piece
of
writing
from
my
drawer
is
from
about
the
second
grade.
We
were
given
the
chance
to
write
a
play
and
act
it
out
for
the
class.
I
remember
being
very
excited
about
this
assignment.
Although
we
worked
in
groups,
my
strength
being
in
writing,
I
distinctly
remember
my
taking
charge
of
the
group
and
writing
most
of
the
play.
The
other
members
must
have
been
pleased
with
my
ideas,
or
perhaps
were
happy
to
have
someone
else
do
most
of
the
work,
because
they
did
not
protest.
I
remember
I
was
so
proud
of
that
play,
and
I
was
thrilled
with
the
response
it
received
when
we
performed
it
for
the
class.
However,
my
happiness
was
soon
overshadowed
by
a
feeling
of
anger
when
I
saw
another
group
that
had
clearly
borrowed
some
of
the
ideas
from
my
play
and
incorporated
it
into
their
performance.
Upon
expressing
my
outrage
to
the
teacher
of
the
gross
injustice
that
had
occurred,
she
attempted
to
smooth
things
over
by
stating
that
imitation
was
the
sincerest
form
of
flattery.
Needless
to
say,
this
was
not
entirely
appeasing
to
me.
I
did
not
like
being
copied,
of
course,
but
I
think
I
was
more
upset
by
the
fact
that
others
were
robbing
creative
writing
of
the
greatest
freedom
that
it
allowed
the
writer--the
freedom
of
self-expression,
that
is,
to
write
something
completely
unique.
Sometimes
I
find
I
have
to
work
much
harder
now
to
write
originally
than
when
I
was
younger.
Reading
over
some
of
my
papers,
I
was
amazed
at
how
imaginative
I
was.
I
would
write
plays
and
stories
that
had
exciting
twists
at
the
end.
I
think
a
lot
of
this
was
the
result
of
my
mother
reading
to
me
so
much
when
I
was
younger.
I
think
I
tended
to
draw
from
what
I
liked
in
what
I
read
and
incorporated
it
into
my
writing.
I
would
try
to
use
language
that
was
descriptive
and
would
make
the
story
interesting
to
read
or
to
hear
read
aloud.
Instead
of
hearing
my
mother's
voice,
I
was
hearing
my
own
voice
guiding
me
to
write.
Even
now,
I
still
hear
the
voice
as
I
write,
and
I
always
strive
to
be
as
true
to
that
voice
as
I
can
in
my
writing.
Certain
forms
of
writing
that
I
learned
made
it
difficult
to
express
that
voice.
Research
papers,
for
example,
were
less
enjoyable
for
me
because
the
numerous
facts
that
were
required
to
be
included
tended
to
mask
the
voice
behind
the
words,
if
allowing
for
it
to
be
heard
at
all.
This
continued
to
be
a
problem
with
the
lab
reports
I
had
to
write
in
college
for
biology
and
psychology.
There
was
so
much
emphasis
on
format
that
it
was
really
hard
to
write
something
different
and
interesting
because
it
would
not
be
appropriate
for
the
subject.
This
problem
would
occur
not
only
in
scientific
writing
but
would
also
creep
up
in
other
writing
assignments,
particularly
book
reports.
They
focused
on
plot,
characters,
climax,
and
other
simple
aspects
of
stories,
but
they
always
seemed
to
me
just
tedious
summaries
to
prove
I
read
something.
The
need
to
make
sure
that
these
elements
were
comprehended
by
me
as
a
reader
was
apparently
more
important
to
the
teacher
than
what
I
thought
of
the
book
and
how
the
elements
worked
together
to
create
an
interesting
book.
However,
I
did
attempt
to
use
my
voice,
even
if
only
to
make
boring
assignments
a
little
more
interesting
to
write
and
read.
In
a
book
report
I
have
saved
from
about
the
fourth
grade,
one
teacher
acknowledges
and
praises
this
attempt--"Barbara,
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
your
well-written
summary!
What
an
outstanding
first
book
report..
.demonstrating
your
rich
vocabulary
and
flair
for
expression..
.a
fine
piece
of
writing
that
you
should
be
very
proud
of!!!"
Indeed
I
was
quite
proud
at
the
time
I
am
sure,
but,
looking
at
it
now,
I
am
more
impressed
by
how
neat
my
penmanship
was
in
that
hand-written
report.
After
learning
to
type
in
the
7th
grade,
my
assignments
from
then
on
usually
were
required
to
be
typed.
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
I
have
since
lost
my
ability
to
write
neatly
without
great
effort,
but,
for
better
or
for
worse
(I
have
not
decided),
adequate
typing
skills,
which
I
do
possess,
seem
to
be
all
that
I
require
for
my
current
writing
assignments.
th
In
6
grade
I
had
the
wonderful
opportunity
to
attend
a
special
statewide
writing
program
for
kids
called
Writer's
Ink.
I
felt
honored
to
be
one
of
the
four
students
chosen
to
attend
from
my
grade
as
we
were
supposed
to
represent
the
best
writers
in
our
age
bracket.
I
remember
attending
a
workshop
on
writing
and
receiving
a
journal
in
which
we
did
some
writing
exercises.
I
still
have
that
journal.
One
exercise
asked
us
to
think
of
a
variety
of
adjectives
and
then
incorporate
them
into
a
poem.
Another
asked
us
to
create
an
exciting
beginning
to
a
story
when
only
given
the
opening
line.
I
had
a
lot
of
fun
at
that
conference,
and
it
was
one
more
experience
that
added
to
my
growing
love
for
writing.
Being
chosen
to
attend
did
give
me
a
little
confidence
that
maybe
I
did
have
some
talent
when
it
came
to
writing.
However,
I
remember
I
was
still
too
timid
to
offer
to
share
anything
I
wrote
with
the
other
children
at
the
conference.
In
high
school,
I
often
had
to
share
my
writing
with
other
students
when
the
teacher
would
have
us
peer-edit
our
papers.
Although
I
was
not
exactly
thrilled
to
be
letting
other
people
read
my
paper,
it
did
not
bother
me
too
much
because
I
knew
most
of
the
students
did
not
take
the
responsibility
seriously.
They
were
either
too
afraid
to
point
out
mistakes
or
took
the
exercise
as
a
joke
because
they
knew
most
students
would
be
frantically
writing
their
final
drafts
the
night
before
the
assignment
was
due
and
they
were
not
likely
to
even
remotely
resemble
the
first
drafts.
Whatever
the
case
may
be,
having
a
student
critique
my
paper
was
not
too
intimidating
for
me.
However,
what
I
did
find
difficult
was
confronting
a
teacher
when
I
disagreed
with
a
grade.
I
was
not
afraid
to
approach
my
teachers,
but
it
was
slightly
unnerving
for
me
that
I
had
put
myself
in
a
position
where
I
had
to
defend
my
writing.
I
would
take
a
poor
grade
on
a
paper
as
a
poor
reflection
on
myself
as
a
writer.
I
would
not
blame
a
teacher
for
misunderstanding
my
writing,
but
rather
I
would
blame
myself
for
not
being
as
clear
as
I
should
have
been.
I
cannot
help
but
take
any
comments
on
my
writing
as
personally
as
I
take
writing
itself.
Even
today,
I
am
still
leery
about
letting
others
read
my
writing.
Sometimes
I
think
that
because
my
writing
is
personal
it
must
be
kept
private.
So,
I
am
often
still
reluctant
when
I
have
to
show
my
writing
to
someone,
even
though
I
may
have
reason
to
believe
the
response
will
be
positive.
My
parents
will
sometimes
find
a
paper
of
mine
from
school,
read
it
without
my
knowledge
and
tell
me
later
that
they
were
very
impressed.
Recently
they
read
a
paper
in
which
I
discussed
my
history
as
a
reader
and
had
mentioned
them
reading
to
me
when
I
was
younger.
Apparently
they
were
really
touched
by
the
comments
I
made
concerning
them.
I
was
not
upset
that
they
had
read
my
writing,
perhaps
because
I
discovered
it
after
the
fact
and
because
they
had
liked
it,
but
I
believe
I
probably
would
not
have
shown
it
to
them
on
my
own
initiative.
I
have,
however,
shared
my
writing
when
I
found
the
situation
to
be
appropriate.
I
chose
to
write
and
deliver
a
speech
at
my
high
school
graduation.
After
reciting
my
speech
for
a
few
faculty
members,
I
was
selected
with
a
few
other
students.
The
experience
of
speaking
something
I
had
written
to
a
crowd
was
probably
of
bigger
importance
then
I
placed
on
it
at
the
time.
I
was
able
to
share
the
voice
I
use
in
my
writing
and
have
people
hear
it
as
my
own.
I
may
have
had
some
doubts
about
wanting
to
give
a
speech
at
the
time,
but
looking
back
I
am
glad
that
I
did
it.
I
think
it
was
an
important
experience
and
probably
more
valuable
to
me
in
terms
of
my
development
as
a
writer
than
I
can
know.
Although
it
is
nice
to
have
my
writing
shared
and
especially
praised
by
others,
I
will
always
write
for
my
own
satisfaction.
I
keep
a
journal
that
I
write
in
whenever
I
feel
I
have
something
I
want
to
express.
Like
playing
an
instrument,
which
I
also
enjoy,
writing
is
a
creative
and
emotional
outlet
for
me.
In
my
journal
I
write
whatever
I
feel
like
in
any
form
I
wish.
Some
are
like
diary
entries.
Others
are
poems,
songs
or
just
a
stream
of
thoughts.
There
are
no
rules.
It
is
not
as
structured
as
my
academic
writing
requires,
but
the
disciplined
nature
I
gained
from
my
academic
writing
experiences
has
contributed
to
my
efforts
to
keep
up
with
my
journal.
I
am
always
working
on
devoting
more
time
to
writing
because
it
is
so
important
to
me.
I
began
with
learning
letters,
spelling,
and
grammar
and
then
progressed
through
learning
form
and
style.
Eventually,
I
was
able
to
write
argumentatively,
analytically,
scientifically
or
with
whatever
purpose
the
situation
required.
Looking
back,
I
suppose
writing
must
be
done
in
steps
in
order
to
learn
to
become
complete
in
writing.
I
did
not
enjoy
all
of
the
steps,
but
I
suppose
they
were
necessary
evils.
However,
any
of
the
concepts
of
writing
that
bored
me
could
not
take
away
the
driving
instinct
I
possessed
to
write
and
the
pleasure
I
derived
from
it.
I
am
still
growing
as
a
writer.
I
look
forward
to
growing
with
each
new
experience
that
I
have,
but
I
will
always
keep
with
me
the
past
experiences.
Writing
this
narrative
has
made
me
realize
that
the
little
girl
writing
short
stories
and
plays
is
still
with
me
and
reflected
in
my
writing.
All
of
it
is
part
of
who
I
am
and
forms
the
underlying
voice
in
all
of
my
writing.
I
realize
now
that
I
can
never
reach
a
point
in
writing
where
improvement
is
no
longer
possible.
There
is
no
end
to
what
can
be
written
and
what
I
can
learn
from
it
which
will
in-tum
influence
my
future
writing.
While
this
is
a
history
of
various
writing
experiences
in
my
life
up
until
the
present,
my
history
as
a
writer
is
far
from
finished.
It
is
being
constructed
even
beyond
the
final
words
on
this
page.
