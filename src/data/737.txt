My
History
as
a
Writer
One
of
my
earliest
memories
of
myself
as
a
writer
is
the
atrocious
state
of
my
penmanship.
Throughout
my
elementary
school
years,
this
was
the
only
area
that
I
would
receive
the
lowest
NNeeds
ImprovementO
marks
on
my
report
cards.
As
my
handwriting
became
more
legible
with
practice
the
words
that
I
was
actually
putting
down
on
paper
gained
more
significance
and
strength
as
well.
Now,
going
into
my
senior
year
of
college,
it
seems
hard
to
remember
the
last
writing
assignment
I
wrote
longhand,
instead
of
typing
it
up
on
the
computer.
Looking
back,
the
little
girl
with
the
sloppy
handwriting
feels
more
like
a
character
in
a
book
I
read
once
than
myself
as
beginner
writer.
Those
early
years
of
writing
were
characterized
by
Disney
pencils,
black
and
white
composition
books,
homework
at
the
kitchen
counter,
and
dreamlike
narratives.
I
remember
my
first
writing
assignments
consisting
of
made-up
stories
with
drawings
to
go
alongside
or
interpretations
of
my
own
life
and
the
world
around
me
through
the
silly,
simple
filter
of
an
8-year-oldsO
mind.
The
subjects
were
always
innocent
themes
that
related
to
things
like
my
family
or
friends,
favorite
activities,
summer
vacations,
or
my
ambitious
dreams
to
become
a
Spice
Girl
or
Brittany
Spears.
In
my
free
time,
I
attempted
to
craft
song
lyrics
either
by
myself
or
with
my
best
friend.
Slowly,
in
school
I
was
asked
to
write
about
unfamiliar
topics
and
within
a
wider
variety
of
genres.
Middle
school
is
marked
in
my
memory
as
the
introductory
stage
to
reading
responses
and
introspective
writing.
Writing
assignments
at
this
point
required
more
analytical
interpretations
of
books
and
prompts
that
expected
persuasive
arguments
about
a
concept.
A
couple
assignments
that
stick
out
from
these
few
years
involved
taking
deeper
looks
into
who
I
was
as
an
individual
and
what
shaped
my
life
and
putting
these
discoveries
on
paper.
I
also
remember
being
asked
frequently
to
look
at
myself
as
a
reader
and
a
writer
and
explain
my
strengths
and
weaknesses
and
where
I
would
like
to
improve.
In
7th
and
8th
grade
we
had
to
put
together
writing
portfolios
at
the
end
of
the
year.
These
included
around
six
or
seven
writing
pieces
that
were
supposed
to
show
growth
toward
my
writing
and
reading
goals
throughout
the
year.
The
portfolios
demonstrate
the
assortment
of
assignments
I
had
been
given
in
these
years
as
a
writer.
I
had
to
include
papers
such
as
a
comparison
piece,
a
response
to
literature,
a
Nprocess
pieceO,
a
timed
paper,
a
poem,
a
persuasive
piece,
or
a
paper
written
in
a
different
class.
At
this
point,
I
was
working
on
my
elaboration
and
mechanical
skills.
The
majority
of
the
feedback
I
was
receiving
about
my
writing
was
that
I
needed
to
NsupportO
my
ideas
rather
than
just
NsummarizeO.
I
tended
to
lack
enough
details
and
examples
to
back
up
the
central
focuses
of
my
papers.
I
also
struggled
with
fluency
and
sentence
structure;
I
had
trouble
avoiding
the
use
of
things
like
fragments
and
run-ons
or
having
a
large
enough
variety
of
word
choice.
In
both
of
these
portfolios
I
think
you
could
see
my
growth
as
a
student,
but
I
donOt
think
it
was
until
high
school
that
I
felt
challenged
as
a
writer.
My
9th
grade
English
class
felt
like
a
crash-course
in
thesis
papers.
Other
than
some
grammar
exercises,
an
exploratory
piece,
a
persuasive
piece,
and
an
opinion
piece,
the
rest
of
the
year
was
focused
on
thesis
papers.
This
was
a
very
important
year
in
my
history
as
a
writer
because
it
took
me
out
of
my
comfort
zone
and
made
me
realize
how
much
I
had
to
learn.
I
struggled
with
generating
a
thoughtful
thesis,
being
analytical
enough,
having
supporting
details,
and
transitioning
between
my
ideas
to
create
a
fluent
essay.
I
would
say
that
this
was
the
year
that
I
began
to
understand
what
good
writing
was,
and
that
opened
the
window
of
opportunity
to
become
a
good
writer
myself.
I
will
never
forget
my
10th
grade
English
class.
I
consider
this
to
be
the
turning
point
in
which
I
started
to
enjoy
writing;
I
looked
forward
to
crafting
a
creative
and
unique
idea
that
I
could
verify
with
other
reading
material.
The
literature
I
studied
that
year
examined
questions
regarding
the
human
experience
and
human
nature,
and
in
turn
required
me
to
take
those
large
concepts
into
consideration
as
well.
This
was
my
first
introduction
to
allegorical
works
and
serious
contemplation
of
poetry.
I
was
forced
to
think
more
outside
of
the
box
and
to
develop
as
an
inventive
thinker.
My
teacher
this
year
loved
to
challenge
us
to
become
better
writers
and
encouraged
us
to
find
our
own
voices.
Writing
was
becoming
more
natural
for
me
and
my
products
became
stronger,
more
fluent,
and
well
developed.
Each
year
of
high
school
presented
a
new
challenge
for
me
to
work
towards
and
I
constantly
discovered
new
areas
that
could
be
improved.
I
think
that
the
high
expectations
and
reminder
that
there
was
always
room
to
get
better
helped
me
grow
as
a
writer.
After
my
four
years
of
high
school,
I
was
able
to
graduate
feeling
like
I
would
be
adequately
prepared
for
college
writing,
and
I
donOt
think
I
was
wrong
in
thinking
this.
I
think
I
entered
college
as
a
capable
and
good
writer,
but
as
always
there
was
room
for
improvement
and
to
be
challenged.
I
had
written
research
papers
before
in
my
writing
career,
but
college
research
papers
expected
a
lot
more
than
I
was
used
to.
All
of
the
sudden
there
were
sources
that
were
appropriate
and
sources
that
werenOt,
more
sources
were
required,
and
citing
had
an
entire
rulebook
I
had
never
seen
before.
My
Introduction
to
American
Studies
class
had
me
use
commercials,
paintings,
songs,
and
other
media
as
sources
to
support
my
papers.
In
general,
I
had
been
familiar
with
the
use
of
literature
to
defend
other
literature,
but
not
sources
that
had
no
writing
involved
whatsoever.
This
class
was
also
my
first
experience
with
blogging.
This
was
a
new
type
of
organization
that
I
was
not
comfortable
with
doing.
All
of
my
years
of
writing
had
put
emphasis
on
structure
and
how
a
paper
should
be
shaped,
but
blogging
didnOt
have
any
of
these
rules.
All
of
the
sudden,
the
expectations
about
introduction
techniques,
building
the
background,
stating
a
thesis,
having
body
paragraphs,
and
coming
to
a
conclusion
lost
their
significance.
The
logical
and
fluent
organization
of
writing
was
still
present,
but
I
was
no
longer
required
to
follow
the
Nfive-paragraphO
rule
of
thumb
that
had
been
etched
into
my
mind
as
a
writer.
I
realized
that
teachers
werenOt
checking
elements
off
a
list
anymore
that
they
had
asked
to
be
in
the
assignment.
College
introduced
a
stronger
feeling
of
freedom
and
independence
when
it
came
to
writing.
It
took
me
a
while
to
become
comfortable
with
writing
in
the
casual
and
personal
format
of
the
blogs,
and
it
wasnOt
until
further
down
the
road
that
I
grew
to
appreciate
it.
My
junior
year
I
had
the
fortunate
opportunity
to
study
abroad
in
Barcelona
for
a
semester.
In
attempting
to
find
a
way
in
which
I
could
tell
everyone
from
home
about
my
experience
without
repeating
it
multiple
times,
I
decided
to
maintain
a
blog
while
I
was
abroad.
This
seemed
like
an
extremely
daunting
and
tedious
task.
I
have
never
been
the
type
of
person
to
use
writing
as
an
informal
type
of
expression
in
my
free
time,
or
outside
of
school
assignments.
This
blog
would
be
completely
my
own
creation,
with
no
guidelines
or
expectations
other
than
what
I
chose
for
myself.
I
definitely
felt
pressured
to
try
to
capture
my
experience
for
my
eager
readers
of
family
and
friends.
I
was
initially
surprised
by
how
challenging
I
found
it
to
be
to
write
this
blog.
I
really
wanted
it
to
be
interesting
and
detailed
so
that
I
didnOt
leave
anything
out
and
this
was
a
difficult
and
time
consuming
task.
Eventually,
the
writing
became
much
easier
but
I
continued
to
devote
so
much
time
to
it
that
I
struggled
to
find
opportunities
to
sit
down
and
give
the
blog
the
effort
I
thought
it
deserved.
In
the
end,
I
was
happy
to
receive
such
positive
reviews
about
my
writing
and
was
sorry
not
to
have
a
reason
to
write
it
anymore.
The
blog
now
exists
as
a
record
of
my
four
months
living
abroad
that
I
will
always
have
to
remember
the
experience
by.
Up
until
this
experience,
I
had
enjoyed
writing,
but
I
think
I
had
taken
the
skill
for
granted
and
hadnOt
fully
appreciated
the
value
it
holds
in
my
life.
Not
only
can
it
be
used
to
express
myself,
but
also
capture
the
important
moments
and
feelings
that
have
shaped
who
I
am
today.
This
same
period
in
my
life
also
marks
an
important
milestone
in
my
history
as
a
writer
in
a
different
language.
As
a
Spanish
minor,
I
have
been
reading
and
writing
in
Spanish
for
years
and
slowly
improving
with
each
assignment.
This
semester
in
my
college
career
was
the
first
time
that
I
was
taking
multiple
classes
in
Spanish
simultaneously
and
that
were
dedicated
to
teaching
a
different
subject
other
than
the
language
itself.
I
took
a
history
class
and
a
literature
class
that
were
taught
in
Spanish
and
were
two
of
the
most
demanding
language
courses
I
have
ever
taken.
My
final
paper
in
the
history
course
was
an
extensive
research
paper
about
how
America
was
affected
by
the
Spanish
Civil
War.
Besides
being
in
Spanish,
it
was
one
of
the
most
challenging
papers
I
have
ever
written
due
to
the
quantity
of
information
it
was
expected
to
include.
This
was
definitely
an
eye-opening
experience
about
writing
a
serious
research
paper
and
I
would
say
it
was
the
first
time
I
have
truly
been
out
of
my
comfort
zone
for
writing
in
Spanish.
I
felt
I
was
on
sturdier
ground
in
the
literature
class
because
the
material
was
more
interesting
to
me
and
my
final
paper
in
that
class
was
one
of
the
most
rewarding
experiences
for
me
as
a
writer.
To
have
completed
an
analytical
paper
that
compared
two
pieces
of
Spanish
literature
definitely
signified
an
unforgettable
moment
in
my
history
as
a
writer.
I
was
able
to
include
all
that
I
had
learned
since
those
early
years
of
my
life
into
a
writing
assignment,
and
do
it
in
Spanish.
One
thing
that
I
have
learned
to
love
about
writing
is
that
there
is
always
room
to
grow.
With
every
year,
each
new
professor,
each
assignment,
and
each
new
piece
of
literature
I
read,
thereOs
an
opportunity
to
learn
something
I
hadnOt
known
before.
This
definitely
adds
to
the
beauty
of
writing.
I
have
realized
that
I
shouldnOt
put
a
cap
on
my
expectations
for
what
I
will
learn
or
who
will
be
teaching
me
it.
In
none
of
my
memories
around
writing
have
I
regretted
a
personOs
feedback.
ItOs
impossible
to
incorporate
everyoneOs
advice,
but
I
have
definitely
recognized
the
value
of
taking
it
all
into
consideration.
Writing
will
always
play
a
role
in
who
I
am
and
how
I
express
myself
and
I
should
never
limit
that.
From
the
time
I
was
the
little
girl
with
unreadable
penmanship
that
wrote
about
things
like
her
dog
Rock
or
being
a
mermaid,
to
becoming
an
Nacademic
writerO
in
college
courses,
each
sentence
along
the
way
has
brought
me
closer
to
the
love
for
writing
that
I
have
today.
