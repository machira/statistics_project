A
Personal
Writing
Evolution
When
brainstorming
for
this
paper,
I
found
it
very
difficult
to
remember
a
lot
of
the
writing
that
I
had
done
in
the
last
14
or
15
years.
Of
course
there
were
writings
that
were
more
memorable
to
me
than
others,
but
I
never
realized
how
much
writing
I
had
done
up
to
this
point
in
my
life.
It
also
amazed
me
when
I
looked
at
how
I
evolved
from
a
little
first-grader
learning
to
write
individual
letters
to
a
junior
in
college
writing
very
in-depth
analytical
papers.
My
father
enrolled
me
in
a
catholic
grade
school,
and
this
teaching
had
an
impact
on
the
type
of
writer
I
was
to
become.
To
better
understand
the
way
I
write
today,
let's
take
a
journey
beginning
at
a
time
when
I
was
5
years
old
and
ending
with
the
spring
of
my
sophomore
year
in
college.
In
first
grade
there
were
not
a
lot
of
in-depth
writings
done
because
I
was
learning
how
to
write
letters
in
my
writing
workbook,
following
the
dotted
outlines
of
letters,
words,
and
sentences
with
a
pencil.
In
second
grade
the
teachers
began
to
teach
us
how
to
write
in
cursive
using
the
same
dotted
outlines
eventually
progressing
to
writing
without
the
outlines.
The
first
writing
assignment
that
I
can
remember
was
in
third
grade
when
Mrs.
Walsh
assigned
us
a
paragraph
on
"what
1
want
to
be
when
I
grow
up."
At
the
time
1
wrote
about
being
a
landscapes
just
like
daddy.
I
wrote
my
little
paragraph
and
drew
a
picture
of
me
wjth
an
oversized
head
in
the
front
of
my
dad's
work.
My
dad
kept
this
assignment,
and
still
reminds
me
of
it
from
time
to
time.
When
I
stumbled
across
it
a
few
years
ago,
I
had
to
laugh
at
what
I
wrote.
There
were
misspelled
words
and
the
grammar
left
a
lot
to
be
desired,
but
it
allowed
me
to
see
just
how
far
I
had
progressed
from
that
point.
Gaining
more
writing
experience
in
the
next
few
years,
I
had
what
1
considered
to
be
my
first
in-depth
piece
of
writing
in
seventh
grade.
Mrs.
Tunder
was
given
the
honor
of
teaching
us
how
to
write
a
research
paper.
This
research
paper
had
to
be
8-10
pages
typed,
double-spaced.
Since
then
J
have
only
bad
3-4
papers
that
ever
reached
this
length;
therefore,
a
paper
of
8-10
typed
pages
in
seventh
grade
is
quite
an
undertaking.
She
took
us
through
the
whole
writing
process.
We
xach
pickeda
topic,
mine
bemg
about
shades,
and
we
had
to
find
sources,
at
least
5
of
them,
writing
bibliography
cards
for
each
one
with
index
cards
and
a
blue
or
black
pen.
These
bibliography
cards
were
written
in
such
a
way
that
we
could
j-ust
copy
the
bibliography
entry
right
onto
the
works
cited
ofthe
paper.
Once
I
browsed
through
the
sources,
1
made
a
basic
outline
for
my
paper
with
the
major
topics
listed.
This
outline
expanded
with
the
details
that
would
be
included
in
the
paper.
She
also
taught
us
bow
to
write
note
cards.
These
note
cards
needed
the
last
name
of
the
author,
the
heading
in
the
outline
where
the
information
would
be
placed,
and
the
page
number
where
the
information
was
found.
After
several
drafts,
the
final
product
had
a
very
detailed
outline,
structured
and
informative
body
with
parenthetical
documentation,
and
a
bibliography
page.
1
did
not
have
a
computer
at
this
time
so
I
had
to
type
this
paper
using
the
same
typewriter
that
my
father
used
when
he
was
in
college.
He
graduated
in
the
1960's;
therefore,
the
typewriter
was
very
antiquated.
In
eighth
grade
our
class
decided
that
we
wanted
to
create
arschool
newspaper,
the
Troian
Tribune.
I
can
remember
only
one
issue
of
this
school
newspaper,
but
in
that
issue
was
an
article
by
yours
truly.
The
article
did
not
have
a
snazzy
title,
but
the
subject
of
the
article
was
the
addition
of
a
-girls'
volleyball
team,
which
I
had
founded,
that
balanced
out
the
number
of
available
sports
for
both
girls
and
boys.
The
teacher
who
was
our
mentor
for
the
paper
helped
us
in
writing
these
articles.
The
main
point
that
was
stressed
about
writing
these
articles
was
that
the
first
paragraph
needed
to
have
the
who,
what,
where,
when,
why,
and
how
highlighted,
with
the
rest
of
the
article
going
into
more
detail.
The
first
and
last
issue
of
the
Troian
Tribune
was
a
suecess.
Knowing
only
two
other
people
before
classes
started,
I
can
remember
feeling
nervous
about
-going
into
a
public
high
school.
There
was
a
mix
up
with
registration
since
I
did
not
-go
through
the
public
school
system,
and
I
was
not
registered
until
the
day
before
classes
started.
The
c
lasses
ended
up
being
easier
than
1
expected
because
of
the
quality
of
my
8
years
of
catholic
school
education.
From
my
freshman
year
1
can
only
recall
one
particular
paper
and
the
theme
was
someone
who
had
heroic
qualities.
I
decided
to
use
James
Brady,
the
man
who
was
shot
trying
to
save
President
Reagan
from
an
assassin
and
became
paralyzed
for
life.
Mrs.
Raspanti
gave
us
handouts
on
the
form
of
the
paper,
and
we
practiced
grammar
skills
over
and
over
usmga
textbook
that
we
had.
Outside
of
just-going
over
what
was
on
those
worksheets
and
the
grammar
exercises,
she
really
did
not
go
in
depth
into
how
to
write
a
paper.
It
was
required
of
all
juniors
to
write
a
research
paper,
and
Ms.
Fonagy,
the
Elvis
worshiper,
was
my
English
teacher
for
this
lengthy
process.
She
was
very
detailed
and
thorough
in
her
explanations
and
teachings.
Each
student
went
through
several
drafts
on
their
thesis,
which
had
to
be
written
first
after
you
found
the
topic
and
researched.
A
thesis
for
her
was
a
long
sentence
giving
each
topic
that
would
be
discussed
in
the
paper.
We
had
to
do
note
cards
and
bibliography
cards
again,
but
we
could
not
use
any
information
that
was
not
in
a
note
card.
The
only
sentences
not
from
note
cards
were
the
topic
and
-concluding
sentences
at
times.
I
had
finally
stopped
using
my
dad's
old
typewriter
because
he
went
out
and
bought
a
word
processor,
which
was
user-friendlier
for
me.
My
paper
was
on
the
Title
IX
legislation,
and
the
finished
product
was
a
very
academic
paper,
some
of
my
best
work
to
date.
In
12th
grade
there
was
a
lot
of
writing
assigned.
In
my
Honors
English
class,
we
had
a
journal
that
wehad
to
writein
during
thefirst
five.minutes
of
each
class.
_Mr.
Mai
said
that
if
we
wrote
everyday
it
would
help
improve
our
writing.
I
did
not
really
agree
with
his
theory
on
the
journals,
but
sometimes
I
was
able
to
vent
some
emotions
from
a
game
the
night
before
in
my
journal
entry.
There
were
several
papers
that
I
wrote
in
his
class,
but
the
lengthiest
paper
from
his
class
was
about
either
proving
or
disproving
something,
it
was
somewhat
a
persuasive
paper,
but
in
writing
the
paper
we
could
only
use
facts.
I
decided
to
use
sharks
again
in
this
paper,
disproving
the
public
misconception
that
sharks
are
man-eaters.
He
was
very
thorough
in
his
teaching
andmethods.
His
ideafor
the
thesis
differed
from
Ms.
Fonagy's
in
that
he
thought
the
thesis
could
consist
of
two
sentences
together,
working
the
same
purpose
of.
addressing
the
topic
of
the
entire
paper.
I
.could
not
jcomplete
the
rest
of
my
paper
until
Mr.
Malinowski
approved
the
thesis.
This
paper
took
almost
12
weeks
to
complete
because
he
wanted
to
make
sure
that
we
understood
the
writing
process
and
could
produce
a
very
polished
piece
of
writing.
AP
History
was
another
class
that
same
year
in
which
I
had
a
lot
of
writing
to
do.
The
teacher,
Mr.
Grosso,
was
preparing
us
to
take
the
AP
History
exam
in
May,
and
besides
knowing
all
the
facts
and
tidbits
of
information
from
the
history
of
the
United
States,
there
were
sections
of
the
exam
that
were
essays,
one
particular
section
being
the
DBQ,
document-based
question.
This
question
was
one
section
of
the
exam
itself
and
constituted
a
large
percentage
of
the
overall
scoring.
For
that
class
I
must
have
written
10-12
papers,
covering
a
whole
range
of
historical
topics.
He
wanted
us
to
learn
in
these
papers
to
be
as
specific
as
possible
in
order
to
get
a
better
score.
My
favorite
piece
of
work
in
this
class
was
a
paper
we
had
to
write
on
the
idea
of
the
Constitution
as
an
everlasting
document.
In
order
to
argue
this
we
had
to
go
in
one
direction;
the
direction
1
chose
was
through
civil
rights.
1
remember
being
in
my
local
library
and
basically
leafing
through
the
reference
section,
especially
the
Supreme
Court
encyclopedias.
The
final
draft
was
only
five
pages
long,
but
in
those
five
pages
there
was
a
lot
of
information
affirming
that
the
Constitution
is
an
everlasting
document.
During
my
senior
year
1
actually
did
one
writing
project
that
was
outside
of
classes
and
college
application
essays,
a
letter
to
the
editor
of
the
city
newspaper.
The
Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette
did
print
the
letter.
1
went
into
detail
about
how
I
thought
it
was
wrong
of
humane
societies
to
sell
pets,
specifically
cats,
to
people
without
testing
them
for
a
disease
called
feline
leukemia.
I
had
purchased
a
kitten
from
my
local
humane
society
only
to
find
out
after
I
had
formed
a
bond
with
it,
that
it
had
feline
leukemia,
which
works
in
a
similar
way
to
the
AIDS
virus
in
humans.
My
kitten
died
a
little
over
a
year
later
while
I
was
at
college.
In
the
letter
1
said
that
I
would
have
been
willing
to
pay
more
for
the
kitten
if
that
would
compensate
the
humane
society
for
testing
the
kitten
for
this
disease.
One
of
my
teachers
even
hung
his
copy
of
this
letter
from
the
paper
in
the
classroom.
Making
the
transition
from
high
school
academics
to
the
Lafayette
curriculum
was
not
as
difficult
as
I
first
thought
it
would
be.
In
my
FYS
class
I
had
three
decent
length
papers
to
write
as
well
as
a
weekly
writing
assignment
with
the
added
use
of
a
modernized
computer
with
MS
Word.
Since
this
class
worked
with
a
Writing
Associate,
the
process
of
writing
these
papers
included
a
first
draft
and
meeting
with
the
associate.
I
had
never
met
with
a
writing
associate
before
during
my
writing
process;
however,
I
did
do
some
peer
editing,
but
this
included
working
with
people
that
1
had
known
and
who
knew
me
in
the
same
class.
This
was
a
little
different
since
1
did
not
know
this
person
and
they
were
a
few
years
older
than
1
was.
It
was
difficult
to
be
productive
in
my
meetings
with
my
associate
freshman
year,
and
I
have
to
say
that
the
use
of
a
writing
associate
my
freshman
year
did
not
help
me
very
much.
The
weekly
writing
assignments
consisted
of
taking
two
articles
out
of
The
Wall
Street
Journal
and
doing
the
who,
what,
where,
when,
why,
how
and
also
looking
at
the
big
picture.
Having
an
assignment
that
was
2-3
pages
long
typed
due
each
week
took
a
little
getting
used
to,
but
in
the
end
1
had
a
B+
in
the
class.
I
delayed
taking
FY
W
until
the
fall
of
my
sophomore
year
because
of
the
conflicts
that
having
a
lot
of
writing
would
arise
during
the
meat
of
my
softball
season.
FYW
was
certainly
a
difficult
experience
for
me.
I
felt
when
I
arrived
at
Lafayette
that
I
was
a
pretty
decent
writer.
I
know
that
I
still
had
a
lot
to
learn,
but
FYW
was
a
rude
awakening
for
me.
First
of
all
most
of
the
papers
that
we
had
to
write,
almost
one
every
week,
were
based
on
a
person's
analytical
and
interpretation
skills,
both
with
which
I
have
some
difficulty.
The
second
issue
was
that
the
readings
we
had
were
not
interesting
to
me
at
all,
more
complicated
and
dry
than
anything,
which
compounded
things
even
more
for
me.
When
my
professor
told
me
at
midterm
conferences
that
if
these
were
my
papers
at
the
end
of
the
semester,
my
grade
would
be
a
B-.
This
did
not
make
me
happy
at
all
because
I
strongly
disagreed
with
her
evaluation
of
my
writing.
After
doing
some
extra
work
on
my
own,
I
was
able
to
revise
a
lot
of
my
old
works
and
come
out
with
an
A.
I
had
my
second
writing
class,
which
made
use
of
a
Writing
Associate
this
past
spring
with
my
VAST
class.
I
found
this
class
very
interesting
and
it
was
actually
my
first
choice
out
of
all
of
the
VAST
classes
available.
The
class
was
titled
"Counting
and
Culture,"
a
look
at
forms
of
early
mathematics
and
counting
devices.
We
wrote
three
papers
in
this
class,
all
of
which
needed
to
be
backed
up
with
lots
of
facts
and
proof.
We
also
had
a
journal
due
every
week,
but
the
professor
chose
the
topic
of
the
journal
entry
for
us.
These
journals
were
not
easy
to
do
because
they
were
based
on
the
readings
and
our
own
opinions
of
the
subject,
if
the
readings
were
understood.
In
all
of
the
writings
except
the
last
one
he
chose
the
theme,
but
for
the
last
paper
he
left
the
theme
up
to
the
students.
My
theme
was
proving
that
the
Aztec
codices
were
in
fact
writing
even
though
they
were
drawings.
The
professor
was
very
good
in
helping
us
with
the
writing
process,
and
if
there
was
a
common
problem
with
the
writing
among
all
of
the
students,
he
would
take
time
out
of
the
class
to
go
over
it.
We
even
had
the
day
after
the
drafts
were
turned
in
designated
as
our
writing
associate
day,
in
which
we
would
read
part
of
one
person's
draft
and
asses
it
as
if
we
were
the
writing
associate.
The
work
with
my
writing
associate
in
this
class
fared
much
better
than
my
freshman
year.
I
did
know
my
Writing
Associate,
but
he
was
able
to
work
with
me
instead
of
fighting
with
me.
He
helped
me
out
a
lot
to
improve
and
expand
my
papers,
seeing
things
that
I
did
not
see
when
1
first
wrote
the
papers.
The
largest
writing
assignment
I
have
had
in
my
life
was
my
take
home
final
for
one
of
my
economics
classes.
In
this
assignment
I
had
to
do
an
in-depth
financial
analysis
of
the
company
whose
annual
report
I
worked
with
the
entire
semester,
JC
Penney.
There
were
a
total
of
7
questions
that
needed
to
be
answered
for
this
final.
The
professor
went
over
in
class
a
little
of
what
she
was
expecting
in
these
finals,
but
would
not
get
too
specific
because
she
wanted
it
to
be
our
work.
After
making
an
extensive
spreadsheet,
we
had
to
do
some
importing
to
MS
Word
from
Excel
to
illustrate
points
we
were
making.
This
professor
was
also
one
who
would
accept
nothing
but
specifics;
she
made
a
point
throughout
the
semester
that
you
had
to
be
specific.
If
one
were
vague,
then
the
grade
on
that
particular
project
would
reflect
the
need
for
specifics.
My
final
for
this
class
ended
up
to
be
18
pages
long,
but
I
worked
long
and
hard
on
this
paper
to
make
it
as
specific
as
possible,
my
grade
for
the
semester
reflecting
the
hard
work
I
put
into
the
final.
This
is
the
last
piece
of
writing
that
I
have
done
up
to
this
point.
I
have
to
say
that
while
writing
this
paper
I
was
able
to
see
just
how
much
my
writing
skills
have
improved.
Not
so
much
in
my
college
years,
but
by
comparing
my
early
writings
to
some
of
the
more
recent
writings.
The
grammar
has
drastically
improved,
and
my
papers
tend
to
be
more
organized
and
structured
today.
I
still
see
areas
where
1
have
plenty
of
room
to
improve,
including
not
procrastinating,
but
I
feel
like
I
have
been
lucky
in
having
teachers
that
were
able
to
help
me
learn
how
to
write
a
polished
academic
work.
