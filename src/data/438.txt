Essay
Assignment
I
Am
Going
to
Have
Fun
Today
The
place
was
Mrs.
Schwartzus
class.
The
time
was
second
grade.
I
was
seven.
That,
I
suppose,
was
when
it
all
started.
I
had
actually
learned
how
to
write
much
earlier
than
that,
probably
in
kindergarten
or
even
before
then,
technically
speaking.
But
before
the
second
grade,
I
was
not
quite
writing
yet;
I
was
just
spelling
words.
Reading
came
easily
to
me,
and
spelling
words
was
no
different.
I
learned
the
alphabet
and
how
to
sound
out
the
words
that
made
the
stories
that
I
read;
it
was
a
short
step
to
put
them
down
on
paper
when
I
saw
them,
or
when
someone
told
me
to.
But
that
was
not
what
I
would
consider
rwriting,s
not
in
the
greater
sense
of
the
word.
The
dictionary
(a
la
Webster)
begins
by
defining
writing
as
rThe
act
or
art
of
forming
letters
and
characters
on
paper,
wood,
stone,
or
other
materialis
but
the
true
essence
of
what
writing
really
is
comes
after
the
technical
meaning
of
the
term,
when
it
is
further
defined
as
being
rifor
the
purpose
of
recording
the
ideas
which
characters
and
words
express,
or
of
communicating
them
to
others
by
visible
signs.s
Expression.
Meaning.
Communication.
To
write,
a
person
has
to
do
more
than
just
form
words
onto
paper.
Writing,
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
word,
means
finding
the
soul
behind
the
words.
And
so,
although
I
could
spell
simple
words
since
kindergarten,
I
couldnut
actually
write
until
the
second
grade.
Writing
has
always
come
very
easily
to
me,
but
looking
back,
I
seemed
to
have
quite
a
hard
time
with
the
daily
journal
entry
that
The
Schwartzenegger
(as
we
students
so
lovingly
called
her)
forced
me
to
complete
at
the
start
of
each
day.
The
simple
assignment
was
to
write
at
least
one
sentence
about
anything,
and
then
to
draw
a
picture
at
the
bottom
about
what
we
had
just
written.
Currently,
writing
just
one
sentence
comes
and
goes
to
me
faster
than
a
single
breath.
But
back
then
I
just
couldnut
seem
to
think
of
anythinginot
anything
different,
that
is.
I
remember
staring
at
the
blank
page,
wondering
what
in
the
world
I
was
going
to
write.
rAnythings
was
so
broad
a
topic.
It
was
almost
frightening,
like
something
lurking
in
the
back
of
the
closet
at
nighttime.
I
didnut
know
what
ranythings
wasinot
yet,
at
least.
And
I
certainly
couldnut
elaborate
on
ranythings
every
day
for
an
entire
school
year.
So
I
usually
settled
for
the
simple,
positive
sentence
of
rI
am
going
to
have
fun
today.s
Sometimes
I
wrote
something
different,
like
rToday
is
my
birthdays
or
rMy
mom
is
nice,s
but
rI
am
going
to
have
fun
todays
occupied
the
vast
majority
of
my
journal
entries.
Who
could
lose
with
rI
am
going
to
have
fun
todays?
Certainly
not
me.
The
best
part
about
rI
am
going
to
have
fun
todays
was
that
with
that
sentence,
I
could
draw
anything
I
wanted!
What
a
great
sentence.
Of
course,
at
the
time,
I
didnut
know
that
I
could
draw
pictures
with
words
as
well
as
crayons,
but
heyiaI
was
seven.
These
things
take
time.
Actually,
it
really
didnut
take
as
much
time
as
I
thought.
I
was
writing
crude
essays
by
the
fourth
grade,
and
it
was
in
the
fourth
grade
when
I
wrote
my
rfamouss
essay
about
seasons.
I
donut
remember
anything
about
this
particular
essay,
but
it
couldnut
have
been
anything
spectacular.
However,
I
remember
that
when
I
went
to
one
of
my
younger
sisterus
open
house
events
at
my
old
elementary
school
when
I
was
in
the
sixth
grade,
the
principal
of
the
school
stopped
me
in
the
hallway
and
told
me
that
she
still
showed
my
essay
about
seasons
to
other
teachers,
because
it
was
so
well-written
for
a
fourth-grader.
The
essay
itself
does
not
actually
matter
as
much
as
the
confidence
that
knowing
someone
thought
it
was
so
good
gave
me.
Before
this
moment,
I
knew
how
to
write,
and
I
liked
to
write,
too.
But
nowinow,
I
knew
that
I
was
good
at
it.
Coincidentally,
in
the
sixth
grade,
my
old
friend
the
journal
revisited
me,
but
this
time
it
was
a
voluntary
activity.
I
watched
the
cartoon,
rDoug,s
on
Nickelodeon
on
a
regular
basis,
and
in
this
cartoon,
Doug
had
a
journal.
Since
Doug
was
so
very
cool,
and
I
had
to
be
cool
like
him,
I
started
a
journal,
as
well.
This
simple
act
of
mimicry
turned
into
one
of
the
most
important
and
useful
habits
of
my
life.
Now,
I
didnut
have
to
write
rI
am
going
to
have
fun
todays
anymore.
Somewhere
along
the
line,
ranythings
had
become
reverything;s
the
unknown
creature
lurking
in
my
closet
had
become
my
friend.
I
wrote
in
my
journal
almost
every
day.
I
continued
to
write
for
school,
but
it
was
this
extracurricular
writing
that
really
helped
me
to
advance
my
skills
of
expression.
The
act
of
writing
was
not
always
going
to
be
a
cakewalk
for
me,
however,
as
I
learned
when
I
entered
high
school.
Although
I
was
a
talented
writer,
and
had
even
made
the
finals
in
an
essay-writing
contest,
I
was
terrified
in
my
first
high
school
English
class.
In
this
class,
I
was
forced
to
learn
what
an
ressays
really
is.
Mr.
Tibbetts,
my
teacher,
had
a
reputation
for
being
tough,
and
on
that
fateful
day,
I
was
about
to
learn
why.
He
explained
the
subject
matter
of
the
assignment
first:
I
had
to
write
an
essay
about
any
topic
concerning
the
play
that
I
had
just
read.
No
big
deal,
right?
But
it
wasnut
the
ambiguous
topic
that
made
me
anxious.
What
frightened
me
so
much
about
this
assignment
was
the
essay
length
that
he
oh-so-casually
tacked
onto
the
end
of
the
description
of
the
assignmentiathe
essay
had
to
be
three
typewritten
pages.
Three
pages!?
Was
the
man
insane?
Clearly
he
didnut
know
how
long
three
pages
really
were.
I
heard
a
bunch
of
people
gasp,
and
I
knew
exactly
why,
since
I
was
thinking
the
same
thing.
I
never
typed
anything,
although
I
had
learned
how
to
type
in
middle
school,
but
I
knew
that
rtypewrittens
actually
means
rreally,
really
long.s
I
knew
from
my
typing
class
assignments
that
one
double-spaced
typewritten
page
was
roughly
three
handwritten
pages
for
me.
So
really,
what
this
man
was
asking
for
was
a
nine-page
essay.
It
was
the
ninth-grade
equivalent
of
my
second-grade
problem.
rAnythings
wasnut
a
problem
for
me
anymore,
not
when
I
only
had
to
write
about
it
for
a
handwritten
few
pages.
But
this
essay
had
to
be
huge!
What
could
I
possibly
write
about
for
three
typewritten
pages?
It
simply
boggled
my
mind.
However,
my
mind
was
mercifully
unboggled
soon
after
the
topic
was
assigned.
Mr.
Tibbetts
actually
wasnut
insane,
as
it
turned
out,
and
he
walked
the
entire
class
through
the
assignment
step-by-step,
starting
from
figuring
out
what
the
topic
would
be
and
finishing
with
overall
organization.
The
organization
skills
that
I
learned
in
that
class
would
soon
become
an
important
tool
in
my
writing
career,
although
at
times
I
took
them
a
little
too
seriously.
My
sophomore
year
of
high
school
marked
the
beginning
of
what
I
would
consider
to
be
the
dark
ages
of
my
writing
career.
On
a
brighter
note,
I
learned
that
three
pages
actually
was
not
an
overwhelmingly
long
assignment
length
for
an
essay.
But
I
also
began
my
journey
down
the
nightmare
that
became
learning
how
to
write
in
MLA
format.
This
format
would
probably
not
bother
me
so
much
if
anyone
but
the
most
banal
person
that
I
have
ever
met
had
taught
the
style
to
me.
My
personality
was
sucked
out
of
my
writing
during
my
sophomore
year
as
style
was
sacrificed
for
format.
During
this
year,
I
learned
how
to
use
my
newly
acquired
skills
in
organization
to
write
in
MLA
format,
but
more
importantly,
I
learned
how
to
apply
what
I
would
later
call
rthe
formulas
to
my
academic
writing
assignments.
For
the
remaining
years
of
my
high
school
career,
and
also
for
part
of
my
first
year
of
college,
I
would
use
this
rformulas
to
write
all
of
my
essays.
It
didnut
really
bother
me
at
the
time,
because
I
earned
good
grades
on
almost
all
of
my
essays,
and
actually
thought
that
it
was
expected
to
follow
strict
format
in
academic
writing.
However,
in
the
spring
semester
of
my
freshman
year
of
college,
I
learned
that
this
formula
was
essentially
hurting
my
writing,
and
although
it
is
important
to
be
organized
and
follow
a
format,
it
is
also
important
for
oneus
personality
to
shine
through
in
oneus
writing,
even
in
essays.
In
the
rdark
agess
of
my
writing
history,
I
had
not
understood
that
essays
could
be
more
than
just
informative,
but
could
also
be
enjoyable,
and
even
fun
to
read.
Essentially,
I
needed
to
learn
how
to
put
the
soul
back
into
my
writing
before
I
could
progress
and
grow.
The
difference
between
my
freshman
and
sophomore
year
writing
style
reflects
this
lesson,
and
also
shows
me
that
I
have
grown
tremendously
as
a
writer
through
the
simple
reinsertion
of
style
in
my
writing.
During
my
freshman
year
of
college,
I
wrote
mediocre
essays.
My
arguments
were
sound,
and
I
supported
myself
in
my
writing,
but,
simply
put,
it
was
boring.
I
didnut
have
any
fun
whatsoever
when
I
wrote
anything,
and
it
showed.
I
actually
tried
to
keep
my
opinion
out
of
my
writing,
even
when
an
opinion
was
the
point
of
the
essay!
I
didnut
understand
why
I
wasnut
having
any
fun
with
my
writing,
but
I
did
sense
that
there
was
a
problem.
When
someone
put
my
problem
into
words,
and
informed
me
that
my
writing
lacked
style,
I
denied
it
at
first.
But
soon,
I
realized
that
what
this
person
said
was
true:
if
I
had
a
good
time
while
I
was
writing
essays,
then
the
people
who
read
the
essays
would
(hopefully)
have
a
good
time,
as
well.
I
tested
out
the
theory
during
my
sophomore
year
of
college
with
spectacular
results.
I
could
write
essays
more
quickly
and
relatively
painlessly,
and
was
also
receiving
compliments
about
my
essays,
once
again.
And,
as
my
elementary
school
principal
proved
so
many
years
ago,
a
few
simple
compliments
can
trigger
enormous
reactions.
I
was
soon
recommended
to
be
a
WA
by
one
of
my
teachers,
which
was
probably
one
of
the
best
moments
of
my
writing
career.
I
had
applied
to
be
a
WA
during
my
freshman
year,
but
was
denied.
But
nowinow
others
were
telling
me
that
I
should
be
a
WA!
The
feeling
was
wonderful,
and
motivated
me
to
try
has
hard
as
I
could
to
become
a
WA
and
to
further
improve
and
expand
upon
my
writing
skills.
Although
I
can
currently
write
papers
with
endless
limits
and
open
topics
quite
freely,
I
still
hope
to
learn
a
great
deal
more
about
writing
in
the
future.
Writing
has
helped
me
to
discover
myself
and
has
helped
me
express
my
opinions
and
my
very
being
to
others.
Although
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
I
will
encounter
some
more
difficulties
in
the
future,
I
am
confident
that
I
will
be
capable
of
overcoming
them,
and
becoming
a
better
writer
in
the
process.
With
the
current
skills
that
I
have
acquired
in
the
past
through
challenging
assignments,
compliments
from
others,
and
my
own
personal
drive,
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
today,
and
many
days
to
come,
will
be
fun
days,
indeed.
