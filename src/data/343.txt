My
Literary
Narrative
8.16.02
The
earliest
example
of
my
own
literary,
term
employed
loosely,
work
was
a
paragraph
long
account
of
what
I
would
like
to
do
with
my
life,
from
the
vantage
point
of
a
second
grade
elementary
student.
Like
many
young
children,
I
envisioned
myself
in
the
same
career
as
my
father.
Complete
with
illustrations,
this
work
still
enjoys
prominent
real
estate
in
my
father's
office
while
my
other
heartfelt,
insightful,
and
altogether
more
coherent
literary
endeavors
of
later
years
are
relegated
to
space
in
boxes
in
the
basement.
With
little
grasp
of
vocabulary
or
sentence
structure,
and
with
an
undeveloped
ability
to
articulate
my
thoughts
clearly,
I
sought
to
elaborate
upon
the
reasons
I
wanted
to
spend
my
life
as
a
lawyer.
The
result
was
more
of
a
blurry
snapshot
of
my
thoughts
than
a
precisely
expressed
rationale.
Comparing
that
initial
paragraph
to
any
work
of
my
last
year
in
college
serves
as
a
reminder
of
the
great
progression
and
literary
transformation
of
style
and
ability
I've
undergone
as
a
result
of
my
past
experiences
as
a
writer
and
a
person.
My
elementary
school
years
were
spent
developing
the
basics
essential
to
writers
of
all
levels,
including
spelling,
grammar,
and
vocabulary.
I
remember
that
I
enjoyed
learning
spelling
and
vocabulary
much
more
than
grammar.
In
retrospect,
however,
I'm
fortunate
that
my
elementary
school
emphasized
a
strong
grammatical
foundation
as
a
base
for
literacy.
Learning
proper
grammar
early
has
helped
spare
me
much
suffering
had
I
been
forced
to
correct
ingrained
mistakes
in
my
writing
at
a
later
date.
The
compositions
I
was
assigned
during
my
elementary
school
years
sought
to
incorporate
all
aspects
of
the
literary
tools
and
techniques
being
taught.
Generally,
a
composition
would
take
the
form
of
a
short
story
whose
prerequisites
were
that
it
must
utilize
a
certain
number
of
vocabulary
words,
be
a
certain
length,
and
implement
whatever
grammatical
device
being
practiced
in
class.
By
the
end
of
my
elementary
school
years,
the
necessary
literary
fundamentals
were
firmly
in
place.
During
the
end
of
my
time
in
elementary
school
and
towards
the
transition
to
grade
six,
or
middle
school,
I
developed
an
appetite
for
reading.
In
fourth
grade,
I
read
Jurassic
Park
by
Michael
Crichton,
marking
my
first
experience
with
a
book
marketed
for
adults.
Having
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
novel,
I
began
to
read
other
Crichton
works.
Soon,
I
moved
on
to
other
contemporary
authors
such
as
Dean
Koontz,
Stephen
King,
and
Robin
Cook.
While
Dean
Koontz
is
not
Hawthorne
or
Hemingway,
and
Coma
is
not
The
Odyssey,
these
novels
proved
thoroughly
challenging.
In
addition,
I
found
that
as
I
read
more,
and
enjoyed
reading
more,
my
love
of
writing
increased
as
well.
Particularly
in
my
younger
years,
I
was
heavily
influenced
in
my
own
style
and
subject
matter
by
those
of
other
authors
I
read.
After
reading
Ray
Bradbury,
many
of
my
themes
and
short
stories
would
involve
science
fiction.
By
borrowing
from
other
authors
initially,
I
was
able
to
try
on
different
styles
and
begin
to
find
my
own
voice.
In
middle
school,
the
vocabulary
and
grammar
lessons
continued,
but
were
supplemented
by
more
involved
reading
assignments.
Book
reports
became
regular
undertakings,
and
taught
me
to
read
for
comprehension
as
well
as
enjoyment.
Between
grades
six
and
eight,
my
ability
to
impart
my
thoughts
and
feelings
in
words
greatly
improved
as
I
gained
better
control
and
command
of
vocabulary
and
syntax.
Writing
assignments
became
more
complex
and
developed
as
I
was
asked
to
begin
to
give
characters
in
stories
personality
and
implement
proper
introductions
and
conclusions
to
both
works
of
fiction
and
book
reports.
By
eighth
grade,
I
was
required
to
write
and
read
poetry,
particularly
favoring
Poe
and
Whitman.
In
regard
to
writing,
middle
school
forced
me
to
take
more
chances
creatively
and
really
seek
clarity
in
my
word
choice.
By
the
end
of
eighth
grade,
I
had
changed
my
writing
medium
from
pen
and
paper
to
computer
when
the
option
was
available.
Aside
from
saving
a
lot
of
time,
having
my
work
saved
on
the
computer
drastically
improved
the
quality
of
my
writing.
When
using
a
pen
for
my
themes
and
assignments,
I
wasn't
prone
to
taking
chances
or
experimenting
with
sentence
structure
knowing
that
a
mistake
would
mean
rewriting
an
entire
page.
Furthermore,
once
I
had
finished
a
final
copy
of
an
assignment
there
would
be
no
more
revision
or
corrections,
or
it
would
again
mean
rewriting
an
entire
assignment.
However,
with
the
computer
I
was
free
to
change
my
words
and
modify
my
work
without
fear
of
an
irreparable
error.
Revision
was
a
much
less
painful
process
as
I
could
continually
alter
and
rearrange
my
writing
without
sacrificing
large
amounts
of
time.
I
can
also
type
markedly
faster
than
I
can
write,
freeing
more
time
for
me
to
concentrate
on
what
I'm
writing
without
the
worry
of
a
typo
or
a
misplaced
sentence.
The
computer
has
improved
my
writing
ability
to
such
an
extent
that
I
no
longer
commit
any
work
longer
than
a
few
paragraphs
to
paper
without
first
typing
it.
Upon
entering
high
school,
I
found
myself
fairly
well-prepared
for
the
types
of
assignments
that
would
be
expected
of
me.
In
ninth
grade,
my
English
class
was
required
to
keep
a
journal
and
record
our
thoughts
on
topics
varying
daily.
This
practice
taught
me
to
express
my
thoughts
concisely
yet
clearly.
In
stark
contrast
to
this
brief
treatment,
my
history
class
was
required
to
submit
a
twenty
page
assessment
of
European
nationalism.
While
this
assignment
was
mainly
an
assessment
and
regurgitation
of
fact,
it
nevertheless
exposed
me
to
the
difficulties
of
differentiating
between
facts
and
ideas
central
to
my
purpose,
and
those
which
are
unnecessary
and
superfluous.
Ninth
grade
also
marked
my
first
exposure
to
the
American
classics
such
as
The
Catcher
in
the
Rye
and
The
Great
Gatsby
as
well
as
the
writings
of
Thoreau
and
Emerson.
Through
these
works,
I
began
to
see
the
power
of
persuasion
present
in
both
works
of
fiction
and
nonfiction.
class,
I
was
required
to
submit
a
paper
in
which
I
had
to
take
a
clearly
defined,
clearly
argued
stand
on
an
issue
of
global
importance.
Dissimilar
to
my
aforementioned
history
paper
of
the
previous
year,
this
marked
the
first
time
I
had
develop
a
thesis
on
a
major
assignment.
This
paper
and
the
feedback
I
received
during
the
time
I
spent
working
on
it,
greatly
improved
my
ability
to
argue
an
opinion
rationally
and
with
facts
to
support
it.
I
gained
further
insight
into
the
use
of
primary
and
secondary
sources,
and
the
relative
strengths
and
weakness
of
each
type
of
information.
The
paper
itself,
an
argument
on
the
steps
the
United
States
should
take
to
encourage
democracy
in
Myanmar,
was
the
product
of
countless
hours
of
research
and
the
culmination
of
all
I'd
learned
in
regard
to
writing
thus
far.
My
junior
year
was
another
crucial
stepping
stone
in
the
writing
process
leading
me
to
my
current
position.
I
took
my
first
A.P.
class
this
year,
U.S.
History,
and
learned
that
doing
well
and
writing
well
in
this
course
would
require
not
only
elevated
language
or
strong
factual
support,
but
an
equal
use
of
both.
This
year
and
this
class
set
me
in
motion
to
become
the
writer
I
am
today.
My
English
class
this
year
concentrated
heavily
on
Shakespeare
and
other
major
British
writers
such
as
Dickens
and
the
Bronte
sisters.
I
learned
more
about
the
complexities
of
the
English
language
itself
this
year
and
the
importance
of
varied
sentence
structure
to
creating
an
interesting
work.
This
year
was
also
a
departure
in
my
own
personal
feelings
in
regard
to
how
I
felt
about
others'
revising
and
proofreading
my
work.
I
had
previously
been
defensive
about
the
content
of
my
papers
and
somewhat
self-conscious
about
my
writing,
particularly
creative
works
and
poetry.
As
I
gained
maturity
and
confidence
in
my
own
abilities
as
a
writer
it
became
easier
to
open
up
and
accept
criticism
for
what
it
was,
a
constructive
attempt
to
improve
my
work.
I
never
particularly
enjoyed
peer
revision,
but
I
gained
an
appreciation
for
it
after
seeing
how
the
creative
input
of
others
made
a
notable
difference
in
the
quality
of
my
writing
assignments.
Instead
of
refusing
to
allow
others
to
review
my
work,
I
now
openly
seek
their
advice
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
varying
perspectives
bring
varying
insights.
This
new
outlook
was
partially
brought
on
by
the
college
application
process
and
the
realization
that
it
was
more
important
for
me
to
produce
a
quality
paper
than
to
hide
from
criticism.
In
all,
I
wrote
close
to
seven
essays
of
varying
length
to
submit
to
colleges.
Despite
the
heavy
toll
this
took
on
my
mental
health
when
combined
with
regular
schoolwork,
I
was
forced
to
delve
deeper
inside
myself
and
really
try
to
create
essays
and
papers
reflective
of
my
full
ability.
I
feel
that
my
writing
reached
a
new
level
following
the
application
process,
both
creatively
and
structurally.
I
was
able
to
translate
this
increased
ability
into
better
papers
for
school
as
well.
As
a
senior
in
A.P.
English,
I
soon
became
accustomed
to
the
rigorous
pace
of
reading
a
novel,
analyzing
it,
writing
about
it,
submitting
my
work,
and
beginning
anew
with
the
next
novel.
However,
the
most
valuable
contribution
A.P.
English
made
to
me
as
a
writer
was
in
the
analysis
of
poetry
and
literary
conventions.
I
greatly
improved
my
ability
to
recognize
symbolism
and
comprehend
metaphors
in
relation
to
the
larger
work
as
a
whole.
By
the
end
of
my
senior
year
I
was
much
better
able
to
interpret
and
comprehend
the
greater
meaning
of
works
of
both
poetry
and
prose.
Much
time
was
spent
on
the
analysis
of
different
styles
of
writing,
ranging
from
Hemingway's
concise
style
to
Camus's
mental
snapshots.
I
worked
hard
to
implement
what
I
learned
of
other
authors
to
make
my
own
work
better.
My
experiences
as
a
writer
prior
to
college
prepared
me
well
for
the
type
of
writing
asked
of
me
my
freshman
year.
Relying
on
my
literary
training
in
high
school
to
carry
the
bulk
of
my
work,
I
was
able
to
concentrate
more
time
on
an
effective
introduction
and
conclusion.
With
confidence
in
my
writing
abilities,
I
was
able
to
put
more
emphasis
on
the
substance
of
my
papers
without
as
much
anxiety
regarding
the
style.
However,
the
adjustment
from
high
school
writing
to
college
level
was
still
a
great
leap.
While
papers
were
assigned
less
frequently,
they
were
always
of
a
deeper
nature
requiring
much
thought
and
an
intelligently
crafted
thesis.
I
found
myself
subject
to
writer's
block
on
more
than
one
occasion
as
I
tend
to
spend
too
much
time
trying
to
craft
the
perfect
sentence.
I
made
good
use
of
my
First
Year
Seminar's
Writing
Associate
during
the
fall
semester.
All
things
considered,
however,
I
feel
that
my
writing
gradually,
but
steadily,
improved
with
each
paper
over
the
course
of
my
freshman
year.
I
look
forward
to
continuing
to
stockpile
my
own
personal
arsenal
of
literary
weapons
to
use
in
my
writing
as
I
progress
as
a
writer.
