Processing:
My
History
as
a
Writer
As
a
young
girl
I
was
full
of
ideas,
whims,
and
energy
always
wanting
to
express
myself
to
my
parents,
classmates,
and
teachers.
My
imagination
was
uncontrollable.
Before
learning
to
write,
I
would
use
speech
to
interact
with
the
world
around
me,
maybe
a
little
too
much.
I
have
a
distinct
memory
of
my
grandmother
on
a
long
car
trip
imploring
me
to
Nshush
for
just
a
minute.O
I
always
had
an
idea
to
share
with
those
around
me,
and
this
idiosyncrasy
is
not
adored
by
adults
desiring
a
little
peace
and
quiet.
Fortunately,
writing
became
a
quiet
and
thoughtful
expression
of
my
childish
imagination.
Various
mediums
and
instruments
have
been
used
throughout
my
life
to
produce
writing.
These
mechanisms
have
changed
greatly
as
my
writing
has
transformed
from
childish
self-expression
to
academic
and
instructive
papers.
Being
quite
young
when
I
learned
to
write
I
have
no
memories
of
the
actual
process.
However,
once
I
was
able
to
write
I
remember
using
this
newfound
form
of
expression
in
almost
every
situation,
most
often
when
I
was
bored
with
the
world
around
me.
I
would
write
all
over
the
back
of
childrenOs
menus
while
waiting
for
the
food
that
I
ordered.
My
writing
was
very
simplistic
at
this
time.
I
would
sign
my
name
and
then
I
would
copy
the
words
written
on
the
menu.
While
this
writing
lacked
creativity,
it
was
important
in
the
formation
of
my
confidence
as
a
writer.
I
began
to
understand
that
writing
was
an
enjoyable
activity
that
helped
to
fill
times
of
boredom.
Writing
soon
became
a
pastime
of
mine
that
kept
me
entertained
for
hours,
until
sports,
schoolwork,
and
social
activities
replaced
the
time
I
previously
utilized
for
personal
and
creative
writing.
My
creative
writing
developed
through
the
utilization
of
both
structured
and
unstructured
writing
mediums
while
I
was
in
elementary
school.
My
unstructured
writing
began
when
my
mother
purchased
me
a
diary.
The
diary
had
a
lock
on
the
side
to
prevent
it
from
being
read
from
anyone
who
didnOt
have
the
key.
It
was
orange
and
had
two
baby
tigers
on
the
front.
I
am
still
in
possession
of
this
window
into
my
childhood.
I
found
it
recently
in
my
closet,
and
sat
down
for
hours
reading
through
my
thoughts
and
experiences.
My
handwriting
was
large
and
messy,
and
my
writing
focused
on
boys,
friends,
and
predominantly
myself.
I
reflected
on
a
bad
day
at
school
or
made
a
list
of
things
I
wanted
for
my
birthday.
I
was
not
writing
to
myself
in
this
diary,
but
instead
the
diary
itself.
Often
I
would
apologize
to
the
diary
for
not
writing
for
awhile,
or
just
making
a
short
entry
because
I
was
busy.
It
seemed
at
a
young
age
that
I
understood
that
writing
for
a
specific
audience
is
important
in
honing
this
craft.
Writing
in
my
diary
helped
me
to
develop
and
improve
my
writing,
while
gaining
the
confidence
to
share
my
writing
with
teachers
and
friends.
Structured
writing
activities
also
played
a
key
role
in
the
development
of
my
extracurricular
writing.
While
in
the
second
grade,
my
friend
Sallie
and
I
became
bored
with
the
typical
girl
activities
of
dressing
up,
playing
with
dolls,
and
talking
about
boys.
We
began
to
write
plays
together,
act
in
them
together,
and
film
them
to
show
to
her
parents
later
in
the
day.
We
would
lock
ourselves
in
her
basement
for
hours
writing
elaborate
scripts,
mostly
about
the
adventures
of
the
American
Girl
dolls.
The
characters
were
already
created,
but
our
imagination
went
wild
developing
plots,
scenes,
and
storylines.
Often
we
collaborated
on
the
script
or
broke
up
acts
and
scenes
amongst
ourselves.
Utilizing
a
specific
form
for
my
creative
writing,
rather
than
just
freely
expressing
my
thoughts
in
a
diary,
prepared
me
for
writing
in
school.
Creative
writing
soon
became
required
in
school,
when
the
teachers
felt
that
we
students
had
mastered
the
basics
of
this
craft.
The
first
writing
project
that
I
can
remember
involved
writing
a
poem
for
each
of
our
mothers
for
MotherOs
Day
in
second
grade.
However,
all
the
poems
from
each
student
in
the
class
would
be
bound
into
a
book
that
would
be
given
to
all
the
mothers
of
students
on
out
class.
I
was
extremely
nervous
for
my
poem
to
be
read
by
not
only
my
teacher
but
my
family
and
all
the
families
of
students
in
my
class.
Furthermore,
I
was
also
unfamiliar
with
writing
poetry;
my
previous
writing
had
focused
on
plays
or
short
stories.
We
worked
on
this
project
for
weeks,
first
learning
about
poetry
and
its
specific
constructs.
Next,
each
student
brainstormed
ideas
or
themes
for
our
MotherOs
Day
poems.
Finally,
we
set
out
to
explain
our
appreciation
and
love
for
our
own
mother
in
poem
form.
I
have
no
idea
the
grade
I
received
on
this
project,
but
I
am
certain
that
my
mother
loved
the
poem
nonetheless.
This
experience
made
me
self-conscious
about
my
writing,
because
my
poem
expressed
personal
feelings
about
my
mother
and
showcased
my
merely
basic
writing
skills.
This
personal
expression
was
shared
and
passed
around
all
the
families
of
my
second
grade
class.
I
remember
few
other
writing
experiences
from
this
young
age
as
vividly
as
this
poem
project.
My
emotional
concerns
about
sharing
my
writing
have
made
it
extremely
memorable.
Throughout
elementary
school,
my
writing
developed
by
writing
book
reports,
short
stories,
and
short
answers
on
tests.
All
of
this
writing
was
completed
on
lined
paper
with
either
a
pen
or
a
pencil.
Writing
was
a
manual
task
at
this
age,
and
took
much
thought,
concentration,
and
erasing.
Each
thought
had
to
be
formulated
into
a
perfect
sentence
or
it
would
be
rubbed
away
and
replaced
with
new
words.
However,
this
form
of
writing
has
become
archaic
and
replaced
with
word
processing.
At
my
school,
typing
classes
began
in
fifth
grade
in
a
small
room
with
less
than
twenty
computers.
For
two
days
a
week,
and
about
thirty
minutes
in
each
session,
the
students
and
I
would
follow
the
Mavis
Beacon
typing
program.
We
learned
to
use
two
hands
to
type
the
keys,
and
not
just
one
pointer
finger.
I
really
enjoyed
typing
class,
because
the
CD
program
included
fun
games
to
play.
Unfortunately,
typing
class
became
much
less
fun
when
after
a
few
weeks
our
hands
and
the
keyboards
were
covered
with
a
cloth.
We
could
no
longer
see
the
keys
we
were
typing
and
had
to
inherently
remember
where
the
keys
were
located
on
the
keyboard.
I
had
been
staring
at
the
keyboard
while
typing
during
previous
typing
lessons,
and
had
no
memory
of
where
the
keys
were
located.
I
was
not
alone
in
this
plight;
most
students
had
relied
on
seeing
the
keys
to
know
where
they
were
located
as
well.
For
writing
papers
at
home,
I
could
still
look
at
the
keyboard,
but
in
typing
class
this
would
not
fly.
My
ability
to
type
freely
eventually
developed
not
as
a
result
of
typing
class,
but
instant
messaging
programs.
I
began
instant
messaging
at
the
beginning
of
middle
school.
After
school,
I
would
have
to
do
homework
on
my
home
computer,
but
instead
of
just
doing
schoolwork,
I
would
talk
to
my
friends
through
AOL
Instant
Messenger.
By
using
this
program
for
hours
after
school,
I
learned
to
type
quickly
and
without
looking
at
the
keys.
However,
the
ability
to
type
quickly
has
come
at
the
cost
of
abbreviated
and
slang
communication
skills.
Instant
messaging
has
improved
my
writing
by
allowing
me
to
type
rapidly,
but
it
has
detracted
from
the
quality
of
my
writing.
Instant
messaging
does
not
involve
creative
or
complex
writing,
but
short
simple
phrases
to
communicate
quickly
with
multiple
people
at
the
same
time.
Instant
messaging
slang
continues
to
invade
my
oratory
communication
and
writing,
but
the
typing
skills
it
has
provided
me
are
tremendously
valuable.
Typing
papers
and
written
reports
became
commonplace
at
the
end
of
7th
and
8th
grade,
but
I
cannot
remember
any
specific
writing
projects
that
I
completed
at
this
time.
My
writing
skills
were
formed
at
this
point
and
I
had
developed
a
pretty
extensive
vocabulary.
The
focus
of
writing
became
reflecting
and
critiquing
other
works
read
in
class
or
for
homework.
Creative
writing
was
much
less
common
in
my
academic
classes,
and
mostly
used
only
in
Spanish
class
to
gain
an
understanding
of
this
new
language.
Responsive
writing
was
nearly
impossible
in
Spanish
class,
because
most
students,
including
myself,
did
not
have
the
ability
to
read
Spanish
novels
or
other
literary
works.
In
middle
school,
the
public
school
program
required
certain
essays
to
be
submitted
to
the
county.
These
essays
were
dubbed
ECR,
Extended
Critical
Response,
and
BCR,
Brief
Critical
Response,
and
their
perfection
became
the
mission
of
my
teachers.
The
ECR
and
BCR
were
utilized
in
the
final
exams
of
all
my
classes
in
middle
school
and
were
graded
off-site
by
county
school
officials.
Practicing
for
these
essays
increased
my
ability
to
critically
and
thoughtfully
respond
to
texts,
a
skill
that
has
been
imperative
in
college.
For
high
school,
I
attended
a
private
high
school
that
hosted
the
International
Baccalaureate
Program,
which
insisted
upon
writing
in
all
disciplines.
Our
papers
were
structured
by
word
count
and
often
sent
throughout
the
world
to
be
graded
by
other
IB
professors.
I
also
took
many
AP
classes
in
high
school
were
essay
writing
was
focused
upon
for
the
final
exams.
Writing
was
so
common
that
individual
projects
do
not
stand
out
vividly.
The
research
paper
was
introduced
and
perfected
throughout
my
four
years
at
college.
The
immensity
of
writing
required
by
the
IB
program
certainly
prepared
me
for
the
rigors
of
college.
After
four
years
of
writing
IB
research
papers
and
AP
Exam
essays
in
high
school,
the
college
admission
essay
was
a
return
to
the
self-expressive
nature
of
writing
that
I
enjoyed
as
a
child.
While
many
of
my
fellow
students
found
these
essays
burdensome
and
crucial,
I
was
excited
for
the
chance
to
impress
college
admission
associates
with
a
personal
story,
articulated
in
rich
and
sensory
detail.
I
spent
hours
trying
to
use
the
best
words
to
recreate
the
sights,
sounds,
and
even
smell
of
a
moment
I
experienced
while
digging
a
septic
tank
system
for
a
poor
family
in
the
Appalachian
Mountains
of
western
North
Carolina.
I
grew
angry
with
myself
as
the
essay
teetered
close
to
clich
and
cheesy.
I
wanted
to
share
an
emotional
and
meaningful
experience,
but
I
didnOt
want
to
derive
a
lesson
too
Oafter
school
specialO
from
it.
In
the
end,
I
nixed
the
conclusion
which
explained
the
significance
of
this
experience.
I
hoped
that
recreating
the
situation
that
I
experienced
would
lead
the
readers
to
my
same
conclusion.
This
exercise
in
writing
received
no
letter
grade
or
constructive
comments,
but
I
think
it
is
probably
the
best
piece
of
writing
I
have
produced.
Leaving
home
and
going
to
college
four
hours
away
made
me
very
nervous
for
the
end
of
August
2007.
I
was
nervous
about
living
in
a
dorm
room,
making
friends,
and
leaving
my
old
friends.
I
was
not
nervous
about
my
classes.
I
felt
that
the
IB
program
had
prepared
me
for
college.
I
knew
that
I
could
write
papers,
read
textbooks,
and
respond
critically
to
texts.
I
was
also
very
interested
in
the
classes
I
was
taking,
which
made
me
excited
to
start
learning
from
my
professors.
My
FYS
first
introduced
to
writing
at
the
college
level,
including
how
to
obtain
sources
from
the
Skillman
Library.
Obtaining
college
level
sources
was
a
beneficial
aspect
of
my
FYS.
It
has
certainly
helped
me
in
many
other
classes
as
well.
The
research
paper
for
my
FYS
was
more
challenging
than
any
other
project
in
high
school.
I
had
to
write
a
tweleve
page
paper
on
a
topic
that
I
had
no
previous
knowledge
concerning.
Actually
writing
the
paper
went
quickly,
but
I
spent
hours
finding
sources,
reading
sources,
and
understanding
the
devolution
of
government
in
the
United
Kingdom.
This
paper
taught
me
to
spend
the
bulk
of
paperwriting
researching
sources
and
making
an
outline,
because
it
surely
expediates
the
actual
typing
of
the
paper.
Often
in
high
school,
I
would
start
a
paper
without
reading
my
sources
and
having
no
idea
where
the
paper
would
end
up.
My
FYS
showed
me
that
a
paper
should
start
where
it
ends
and
work
progressively
throughout.
Most
non-writing
classes
at
Lafayette
only
featured
a
final
research
paper
and
short
essays
on
final
exams.
These
requirements
offered
little
challenge,
because
I
was
often
able
to
choose
the
topics
of
the
paper.
When
I
am
interested
and
engaged
in
the
topics,
I
find
it
much
easier
to
critically
respond
to
sources,
ideas,
and
opinions
presented
in
the
works
chosen
by
professors.
Since
completing
my
FYS,
I
have
taken
two
more
writing
classes
at
Lafayette:
Early
American
Political
Thought
and
my
VAST,
Technology
at
the
Table.
Both
classes
featured
ideas
and
texts
that
were
previously
unknown
to
me,
opening
my
eyes
to
various
facets
of
common
ideas.
Early
American
Political
Thought
focused
upon
Alexis
de
TocquevilleOs
work
NDemocracy
in
America,O
a
FrenchmanOs
assessment
of
the
virtues,
liberties,
and
people
in
fledgling
America.
This
viewpoint
was
much
different
than
the
previous
history
classes
which
focused
merely
upon
the
virtuous
founders,
instead
we
talked
and
wrote
about
the
hypocrisy
of
the
founders,
the
subjugation
of
women,
and
the
values
that
influenced
the
American
middle
class.
While
many
lengthy
papers
were
assigned
in
this
class,
I
really
enjoyed
the
weekly
quote
response
papers.
Students
would
choose
a
two
or
three
line
quote
from
the
assigned
reading
and
respond
to
it
in
about
a
page.
This
activity
actively
engaged
me
in
the
reading
of
the
text
and
made
me
think
critically
about
its
implications.
My
VAST
centered
around
the
current
food
production,
distribution,
and
consumption
system
which
destroys
the
environment,
produces
unhealthy
packaged
food,
and
is
controlled
by
big
business
and
government
lobbying.
After
reading
about
the
atrocities
of
the
food
system,
I
was
glad
to
research
and
write
papers
about
organic
food,
community
gardens,
and
family
farming.
Efforts
are
being
made
by
people
to
improve
the
quality
and
decrease
the
environmental
impact
of
food
production
and
distribution.
While
doing
hours
of
research
and
writing
lengthy
papers
is
not
the
most
enjoyable
part
of
any
day,
often
I
find
the
activity
interesting
and
worthwhile
if
I
enjoy
the
topic
upon
which
the
paper
entertains.
This
can
remind
me
of
the
times
when
I
was
younger
that
I
utilized
creative
writing
for
purely
imaginative
purposes.
However,
writing
has
been
transformed
into
an
academic
tool
for
the
learning
and
transference
of
knowledge.
After
college
graduation,
I
hope
to
continue
perfecting
my
writing
in
Law
School
to
eventually
utilize
it
by
writing
case
summaries,
briefs,
and
depositions.
My
ability
to
research
and
write
long
papers
will
be
imperative
in
law
school.
However,
in
law
school,
I
feel
that
I
will
also
learn
to
write
in
a
different
manner.
My
audience
will
no
longer
be
a
talented
professor,
but
an
attorney,
a
judge,
and
a
client.
I
am
excited
to
enter
this
part
of
my
life,
where
I
can
making
a
living
writing
about
the
law.
