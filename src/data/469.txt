Writing
As
a
WA
Fall
2005
NOh,
so
you
go
to
Lafayette?
What
do
you
study
there?O
NI
am
majoring
in
English.O
NOh
really?
What
do
you
want
to
do
with
that
degree
when
you
get
older?O
This
seems
to
be
the
standard
question
to
ask
every
pre-,
present-,
and
post-college
student
during
the
summer
time
D
NWhatOs
your
major
and
what
do
you
want
to
do
when
you
get
older?O
It
is
unknown
to
me
if
people
ask
this
question
just
to
fill
time
in
a
conversation
or
are
truly
curious
about
what
an
English
major
really
does
and
what
we
prepared
to
do.
Nonetheless,
itOs
always
interesting
to
give
your
fellow
conversationalist
an
inspiring,
intellectual
answer
(especially
with
the
English
majorOs
eloquent
way
of
stating
the
simplest
things)
that
leaves
no
subsequent
questions
and
allows
us
to
continue
sunbathing
or
shopping
on
our
summer
vacation.
Although
the
job
of
a
Writing
Associate
is
not
limited
to
English
majors,
being
a
WA
will
most
definitely
improve
the
writing
of
English
majors
and
Engineers
alike.
Being
a
WA
and
then
writing
as
a
WA
is
almost
like
having
Jiminy
Cricket
tapping
on
your
shoulder
every
time
you
take
a
pen
to
paper.
There
are
often
times
when
I
catch
myself
writing
and
mid-sentence
I
realize
IOm
having
a
conversation
with
my
computer
D
something
IOve
never
done
before.
I
hesitate,
scratch
my
head
and
think
back.
My
mind
takes
me
back
to
the
WA
room
during
a
student
conference.
NYou
know,
the
words
just
arenOt
coming
to
me.
I
know
what
I
want
to
sayEkindaEbut
I
just
canOt
get
it
on
paper.
I
spend
hours
at
the
computer
and
I
press
the
delete
key
more
than
the
lettersO
I
remember
thinking
for
a
second,
reviewing
her
assignment,
hoping
to
come
up
with
a
good
idea
for
the
student
so
she
could
take
a
break
from
staring
at
a
blank
computer
screen.
It
was
then
that
I
realized
that
creating
a
specific
thesis
for
the
student
wasnOt
what
my
job
was
all
about.
I
suggested
that
she
take
a
deep
breath,
put
on
some
soft
music
she
enjoyed
and
have
a
conversation
with
her
computer
about
the
paper.
I
encouraged
her
to
just
write.
NYou
can
always
delete,O
I
explained,
NBut
itOs
a
lot
harder
to
add
on.O
I
instructed
the
student
to
spend
some
time
just
writing
on
the
computer
and
email
me
later
in
the
week
if
she
still
needed
me.
Later
that
week,
she
emailed
me
letting
me
know
that
in
her
hour
or
so
of
jamming
to
her
favorite
tunes
and
chatting
with
the
computer,
she
found
her
thesis.
After
she
had
some
length
to
work
with,
we
held
another
conference
to
fine-tune
her
paper
even
more.
Very
often,
when
I
write
for
my
classes,
I
find
myself
Npracticing
what
I
preachO
during
WA
conferences.
In
this
sense,
when
IOm
stuck
with
my
own
writing,
I
have
my
own
Jiminy
Cricket
reminding
me
of
what
advice
I
gave
others.
In
this
case,
I
first
learned
this
literary
technique,
Nwriting
without
an
academic
filterO
in
Professor
FalboOs
College
Writing
class
late
freshman
year.
In
one
of
her
assignments
probing
our
own
writing
experiences,
I
wrote
of
the
freedom
that
comes
with
being
able
to
write
anything
I
wanted:
NThe
letters
jumbled
around
in
my
head
to
form
words
that
flowed
from
the
end
of
my
pencil
in
powerful,
scribbled
sentences
that
could
only
be
described
as
raw
emotions.
There
was
no
filter
in
place
to
process
these
crude
thoughts
as
there
was
in
my
formal
writing.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life,
the
filter
had
been
set
aside
and
words
painted
the
pages
with
no
refinementO
(Weinstein,
2004).
From
then
on,
I
really
enjoyed
writing
because
I
had
unglued
it
from
the
(sometimes)
negative
stigma
associated
with
Nacademic
writingO
and
created
my
own
genre.
This
way,
the
rules
and
regulations
that
have
become
engrained
in
our
head
since
elementary
school
about
writing
were
no
longer
applicable.
I
have
learned
that
unconventional
writing
ultimately
produces
conventional
writing
D
ironic
as
it
sounds.
The
student
that
stares
at
his/her
screen
all
day
searching
painfully
for
thoughts
and
ideas,
will
most
likely
come
up
with
a
paper
that
is
dry
and
uneventful.
However,
the
student
that
enjoys
getting
down
ideas
through
their
own
writing
will
most
likely
produce
a
paper
that
is
rich
in
ideas
and
creative.
I
have
learned
through
my
own
experiences
and
through
the
experiences
of
my
peers
that
it
is
much
easier
to
construct
a
cohesive
piece
of
work
if
you
have
a
solid
background
on
what
you
are
talking
about.
One
of
the
easiest
ways
to
accomplish
this
is
through
talking
or
writing
(either
to
the
computer
or
another
peer).
Either
way,
ideas
are
in
the
open,
ready
to
be
used.
For
the
stricter,
conventional
student,
I
have
found
outlining
to
be
extremely
effective
through
my
WA
conferences.
In
fact,
I
find
it
so
effective
that
I
always
use
it
before
every
paper
and
also
with
my
close
friends
and
family.
I
once
had
a
student
who
was
very
quiet
and
had
trouble
structuring
his
paper.
When
I
was
in
Junior
High
and
High
School,
structure
and
organization
was
my
biggest
writing
problem.
I
had
so
many
ideas
and
creative
phrases,
yet
they
were
scattered
all
over
the
paper
with
no
rhyme
or
reason
whatsoever.
It
wasnOt
until
I
started
reading
other
peopleOs
papers
and
starting
seeing
when
many
students
went
on
tangents,
when
many
students
lost
their
thesis,
and
when
many
students
were
poorly
organized.
Although,
at
this
time,
my
organization
skills
were
not
up
to
par,
I
clearly
saw
others
mistakes
and
worked
with
them
to
correct
them.
I
found
that
the
best
way
to
organize
thoughts
and
ideas
within
a
paper
is
to
outline
everything.
By
outline,
I
donOt
mean
writing
everything
word
for
word
in
a
formal,
typed
outline.
When
I
first
tried
outlining
with
a
student
in
a
WA
conference,
I
only
had
a
piece
of
blank
computer
paper
and
a
red
Sharpie
marker.
I
asked
the
student,
NWhat
is
your
thesis
here?
What
are
you
trying
to
prove?
What
is
your
main
topic?O
I
wrote
it
in
capital
letters
on
the
top
of
the
paper.
As
the
student
and
I
moved
through
her
paper
and
brainstormed
ideas
today,
we
had
a
lot
of
red
arrows
pointing
towards
subsequent
ideas
and
points
all
over
the
paper.
Although
it
looked
like
World
War
III
on
paper,
it
had
everything
the
student
needed
to
write
the
paper
cohesively.
From
them
on,
my
outlines
have
become
neater,
but
ever
since
that
meeting,
I
have
never
written
a
paper
without
outlining
everything
before
hand.
Many
students
ask
for
me
to
jot
down
their
ideas
on
paper
as
we
brainstorm
and
when
we
finish,
we
work
together
to
organize
them
in
a
cohesive
fashion.
While
one
of
the
big
parts
of
being
a
Writing
Associate
is
to
help
others
in
their
writing,
it
is
not
unusual
to
come
across
many
students
whose
writing
is
far
better
than
your
own.
I
remember
during
Drop-In
Hours,
an
upperclassman
handed
me
her
paper
to
be
reviewed.
It
was
unbelievably
written
and
I
searched
for
grammar
mistakes
and
cohesive
mishaps.
However,
I
couldnOt
find
anything.
As
I
read
her
paper,
however,
I
realized
many
things
that
she
was
doing
that
I
had
never
thought
of.
Although
I
was
not
finding
anything
negative,
it
was
loaded
with
positive
feedback
on
my
part.
When
the
student
came
back,
I
felt
embarrassed
because
I
felt
like
I
was
not
being
a
good
help
to
her.
As
the
conference
progressed,
I
ended
up
talking
about
the
positive
she
had
throughout
her
writing.
Some
things
she
didnOt
even
realize
she
did
so
well.
To
her,
her
writing
was
nothing
special.
However,
throughout
the
course
of
the
conference,
the
student
began
understanding
how
her
paper
was
read
by
another
person.
This
not
only
gave
her
confidence
but
encouraged
her
to
work
harder
on
her
paper
to
make
it
even
stronger.
Afterwards,
I
felt
strongly
that
the
student
had
learned
a
lot
about
herself
that
night.
Not
only
did
I
learn
a
great
deal
from
her
work,
she
also
was
able
to
learn
and
use
that
knowledge
in
the
future.
Working
as
a
WA
also
helped
me
grow
as
a
person,
not
just
a
writer.
By
learning
to
adapt
to
different
audiences,
I
gained
new
skills
at
working
with
all
people.
Early
in
my
sophomore
year,
I
worked
with
freshman
in
their
FYS
class.
Although
I
was
older
than
them
and
had
seniority,
I
still
had
to
prove
to
them
that
I
was
intelligent
enough
for
them
to
rely
on
me
for
academic
advice.
I
had
to
work
hard
to
gain
the
confidence
of
my
class
so
they
would
look
up
to
me
and
also
see
the
College
Writing
Program
as
a
legitimate
program
at
Lafayette.
Later
sophomore
year,
I
was
assigned
a
class
that
was
full
of
my
own
classmates.
I
thought
it
would
be
more
challenging
because
I
had
no
seniority
over
these
students
that
would
led
them
to
believe
I
had
more
experience
than
them.
However,
as
it
turned
out,
I
didnOt
treat
my
classmates
like
I
was
any
better
than
them.
I
made
sure
we
were
all
on
the
same
level
and
I
worked
through
their
problems
like
I
was
struggling
with
them
myself
D
when
in
fact,
also
being
in
a
VAST
class
D
I
really
was!
As
a
WA,
we
are
instrumental
in
the
hiring
of
WAs
for
next
year.
I
interviewed
a
group
of
freshman
and
sophomores
with
a
fellow
WA
and
one
of
our
coordinators,
Professor
Donahue.
Outside
of
the
initial
interviewing
process,
we
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
discussing
what
it
means
to
be
a
Ngood
WAO
on
this
campus.
As
each
applicant
came
in
and
left,
we
studied
them
intently
to
make
sure
they
would
make
a
contribution
to
our
staff.
From
talking
with
Professor
Donahue
and
the
other
WA,
I
started
doing
a
personal
check
on
myself
to
see
if
I
met
the
requirements
of
being
a
good
Writing
Associate.
While
my
self-evaluation
was
positive
and
I
felt
confident
in
myself,
I
realized
being
a
Writing
Associate
is
a
very
important,
difficult,
yet
rewarding
job.
Throughout
the
interviewing
process
my
initial
opinions
of
certain
applicants
changed
significantly
by
the
end
of
the
process.
I
realized
that
a
good
candidate
for
the
WA
program
is
not
someone
who
is
already
accomplished
on
campus
with
lists
of
extra
curricular
activities
and
stellar
grades.
While
that
is
obviously
important
to
understanding
the
work
ethic
of
the
student,
we
ultimately
favored
people
who
were
willing
to
learn;
willing
to
learn
from
their
mistakes,
willing
to
learn
from
othersO
shortcomings,
and
willing
to
take
that
learned
information
and
apply
it.
Interestingly
enough,
I
walked
away
from
that
interview
as
if
I
was
interviewed
myself.
It
motivated
me
in
a
way
that
made
me
want
to
me
a
good
example
for
other
students
to
aspire
to
on
campus.
In
response
to
the
standard
question
that
has
been
posed
towards
me
throughout
the
course
of
the
summer,
my
answer
is
simple:
NEnglish
is
not
only
a
subject
that
encourages
intellectual
stimulation
and
literary
comprehension,
but
a
subject
that
trains
and
molds
your
mind
to
think
creatively
and
outside
the
box.
Throughout
my
time
so
far
at
Lafayette,
I
have
truly
extended
my
education
as
an
English
major
by
being
a
part
of
the
College
Writing
Program.
Being
a
WA
not
only
betters
my
understanding
of
the
English
language
and
significantly
refines
my
writing,
it
teaches
me
to
do
so
through
other
students
my
age.
As
a
WA,
I
push
myself
to
understand
the
many
questions
and
problems
writers
run
into
on
a
day
to
day
basis.
Because
it
is
my
job
to
help
other
students
in
need,
it
has
ultimately
motivated
me
as
a
writer.
My
job
encourages
me
to
learn
from
othersO
mistakes
and
their
own
intelligence
ways
to
pursue
my
own
journey
towards
my
best
writing.O
Perhaps
IOll
type
that
up
and
cut
it
out
on
a
little
laminated
piece
of
paper.
Next
time
someone
asks
me
that
question,
IOll
just
hand
them
the
paper!
