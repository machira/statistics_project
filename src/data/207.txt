WA
Writing
Assignment
I
almost
cried
when
I
saw
that
thick
brown
envelope
arrive
in
my
mailbox.
I
had
been
forewarned
about
this
little
assignment
I'd
have
to
complete
in
order
to
prepare
to
become
a
writing
assistant,
but
I
had
hoped
that
it
would
never
reach
me.
Unfortunately,
it
did
and
the
assignment
was
just
what
I
had
expected,
though
thought
little
about
while
I
was
lounging
by
the
pool.
Unfortunately,
that
brown
envelope
jolted
me
back
to
reality
and
I
sat
down
to
begin
the
task
of
tracing
my
writing
history.
The
problem
was
that
summer
vacation
has
a
fatal
affect
on
me.
My
mind
spontaneously
erases
all
thoughts
and
memories
that
have
anything
to
do
with
school.
I
couldn't
even
remember
what
the
last
writing
assignment
I
turned
in
was,
let
alone
the
first
words
I
wrote
on
paper!
So
I
decided
to
do
some
research.
My
ever-resourceful
mother
directed
me
into
the
attic
where
I
found
boxes
that
contained
everything
from
scribbles
to
cursive.
I
soon
realized
that
most
of
my
early
writing
accomplishments
consisted
of
lined
paper
covered
in
large
printed
upper
and
lower
case
letters.
They
reminded
me
of
the
utter
disappointment
I
felt
after
my
first
day
of
school.
My
mother
once
told
me
that
I
sat
at
the
kitchen
table
with
a
pencil
and
some
paper
and
sulked
when
I
realized
that
I
STILL
couldn't
write!
Some
of
my
early
writing
continues
to
haunt
me
today.
Every
Christmas,
with
no
regard
to
my
pride
as
an
educated
college
student,
my
aunt
hangs
a
laminated
piece
of
yellow
construction
paper
with
a
pretty
good
crayoned
rendition
of
Rudolf,
and
a
pretty
mangled
version
of
the
song
Roodoff
The
Red
Nossed
Raned
Dair.
(I
asked
if
I
could
take
it
to
school,
but
they
still
weren't
ready
to
part
with
it.
I
included
a
photocopy
instead.)
Though
I
didn't
really
compose
the
song,
I
still
felt
proud
to
have
written
something
that
others
could
read
and
enjoy.
My
aunt
insists
that
it
was
brilliant
for
a
first
grader.
I
truly
believe
that
the
song
is
directly
responsible
for
my
relatives'
inability
to
accept
that
I
am
too
old
to
believe
in
Santa.
Both
of
my
parents
graduated
from
college
with
majors
in
English,
and
for
as
long
as
I
can
remember
people
have
assumed
that
I
too
would
follow
in
their
footsteps.
I
suspect
it
may
have
been
the
power
of
suggestion
that
caused
me
to
adopt
English
as
my
favorite
subject
in
elementary
school.
Of
course,
it
could
have
been
my
lack
of
math
skills
that
caused
me
to
turn
to
writing
as
an
alternative.
That
could
also
be
the
reason
why
I
remember
little
of
third
and
fourth
grade
aside
from
long
division.
In
fifth
grade,
Mrs.
Graham
gave
me
a
legitimate
love
for
literature.
She
was
one
of
the
first
teachers
to
recognize
my
talent
for
writing,
and
she
was
also
one
of
the
first
to
boost
my
ego
by
telling
me-
So,
I
began
trying
to
impress
her
with
my
work.
Before
I
decided
that
I
liked
to
write,
I
used
art
in
order
to
express
my
creativity.
I
had
been
taking
art
lessons,
entering
shows,
and
had
begun
showing
a
great
interest
in
art
in
school
from
an
early
age.
It
was
in
sixth
grade,
however,
that
I
discovered
poetry
as
another
creative
outlet.
I
showed
one
of
my
earliest
poems
to
Mrs.
Richardson
and
she
entered
it
into
a
poetry
contest
run
by
the
state
of
Rhode
Island.
To
my
surprise,
I
won.
The
event
gave
me
the
confidence
I
needed
to
continue
writing
poems,
and
the
courage
to
try
to
publish
a
few
poems
in
an
anthology,
where
once
again,
my
poems
were
excepted.
(Of
course,
no
one
bought
the
book
but
my
relatives.)
By
high
school
I
learned
that
much
of
my
love
for
writing
stemmed
from
my
love
for
literature,
and
luckily,
this
love
was
fostered
and
shared
by
a
string
of
enthusiastic
English
teachers
throughout
my
years
at
Bay
View
Academy.
My
ninth
grade
History
class
brought
fourth
my
first
major
research
paper.
As
strange
as
it
may
seem,
I
actually
was
the
only
one
out
of
my
whole
class
to
volunteer
to
write
a
15
pager
that
would
be
due
the
day
after
April
vacation.
The
paper
wasn't
necessarily
an
assignment.
It
was
for
a
National
History
Day
writing
contest,
and
there
were
few
guidelines
aside
from
choosing
a
topic
that
dealt
with
United
States
history.
It
seemed
easy
enough
at
first,
until
I
discovered
that
even
the
simple
task
of
choosing
a
topic
could
prove
to
be
very
challenging.
I
soon
discovered
that
15
pages
of
writing
on
the
Jamestown
Bridge
in
Rhode
Island
would
require
a
little
more
research
and
planning
then
a
set
of
Encyclopedias.
Though
tedious
for
a
ninth
grader,
I
found
that
rummaging
through
primary
sources
in
the
state
archives
library
gave
writing
the
paper
new
meaning.
Now
there
was
a
purpose
to
my
paper.
I
would
somehow
have
to
put
everything
I
learned
and
read
about
into
a
piece
of
writing
that
others
would
be
interested
in
learning
from.
Everything
from
margin
size
to
footnotes,
title
page
to
bibliography
had
to
be
standard
in
order
to
qualify
for
the
contest.
I
found
that
such
mundane
details
as
those,
made
writing
the
paper
take
much
longer
than
I
had
expected.
Perhaps,
remembering
to
factor
in
such
details
is
a
concept
that
I
should
take
into
consideration
more
often
these
days.
I
am
aware
now,
that
few
high
school
freshmen
had
ever
been
required
to
write
such
a
polished
and
precise
piece
of
writing.
Though
difficult
at
the
time,
it
put
me
one
step
ahead
of
the
game
in
the
years
to
come.
AP
History
and
English
classes
bring
to
mind
visions
of
weekly
essays
and
journal
entries.
By
the
time
I
was
a
senior
in
high
school,
I
could
pump
out
a
five-page
paper
in
an
hour.
As
time
management
became
key
to
a
healthy
report
card,
I
quickly
developed
my
own
writing
style-
or
should
I
say
routine.
In
my
Junior
year
English
class,
I
was
assigned
my
first
official
term
paper-
Ten
pages
of
pure
critical
literature
analysis.
It
was
around
this
time
that
I
learned
an
important
lesson
about
procrastination-procrastination
leads
to
lack
of
sleep
and
sanity.
I
pulled
my
first
all
nighter
the
night
before
it
was
due.
I
also
cried
a
lot
that
night,
and
was
very
close
to
committing
suicide
when
my
printer
decided
to
malfunction
at
9am
(already
an
hour
late
for
school)
the
next
morning.
Aside
from
the
mistake
of
leaving
myself
little
time
for
the
actual
writing
of
the
paper,
I
enjoyed
the
freedom
of
choosing
my
own
topic,
and
I
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
organizing
the
paper.
I
decided
to
compare
Hemmingway's
A
Farewell
to
Arms,
Crane's
Red
Badge
of
Courage,
and
a
modern
autobiography
titled
Fortunate
Son-
three
perspectives
of
three
different
wars.
I
realized
that
it
was
my
careful
preparation-
which
included
creating
a
thesis,
reading
the
novels
with
my
thesis
in
mind,
marking
passages,
reading
what
other
critics
had
to
say,
and
outlining
the
points
that
I
would
make
in
the
paper,
that
made
it
such
a
success
despite
its
hasty
composition.
Because
of
the
preparation
I
had
in
high
school,
the
transition
to
writing
as
a
college
freshman
was
not
too
difficult.
In
my
freshmen
seminar,
however,
I
discovered
that
the
writing
topics
I
would
have
to
tackle
were
a
little
less
interesting,
and
much
more
obscure
than
the
relatively
broad
topics
assigned
in
high
school.
Revolutions
in
Science
was
NOT
the
seminar
I
picked,
and
I
must
admit,
that
typing
a
10
page
paper
on
Copernicus'
Theory
of
the
Universe
could
be
a
bit
tedious.
Literary
Theory
and
analysis
also
posed
a
challenge
that
I
did
not
anticipate.
My
professor
expected
an
entirely
different
writing
style
than
I
was
used
to.
She
encouraged
informality
over
structured
essays.
She
also
liked
it
when
we
included
questions
and
personal
reflections
in
our
writing.
It
was
difficult
for
me
to
give
up
what
I
considered
good
writing,
to
meet
the
needs
of
her
class.
However,
the
class
allowed
me
to
become
much
more
flexible
with
my
writing.
I
became
less
afraid
to
analyze
new
ideas
and
try
different
styles
of
writing.
I
came
upon
another
similar,
yet
very
different
problem
in
my
VAST
class.
My
professor
taught
my
Water
and
Society
class
much
like
a
law
class.
As
a
result,
we
were
encouraged
to
incorporate
law
into
our
papers.
In
essence,
every
statement
made
in
our
papers
had
to
be
thoroughly
backed
up
by
every
piece
of
evidence
we
could
dig
up.
Each
paper
was,
in
a
sense,
a
mini
argument,
in
which
we
addressed,
and
disqualified
any
counter-arguments
that
might
arise.
The
fact
that
I
could
not
just
back
up
my
thesis...but
also
had
to
consider
any
loopholes
that
could
be
found
was
quite
complicated,
and
often
made
me
feel
like
my
paper
was
never
really
complete.
I
realized,
however,
that
these
challenges
were
important
steps
in
becoming
a
well-
rounded
writer.
As
of
last
semester,
I
was
given
more
of
a
choice
in
the
type
of
writing
classes
I
would
take.
I
really
enjoy
analyzing
poetry,
and
I
find
that
I
now
incorporate
many
of
the
writing
styles
I
have
been
exposed
to
in
my
more
focused
Literature
classes.
In
knowing
many
ways
to
analyze
a
topic,
I
was
able
to
write
extended
essays
on
short
poems
by
Elizabeth
Browning
without
feeling
like
I
didn't
have
enough
to
say.
Not
only
have
I
learned
that
writing
is
a
long
and
complicated
process,
but
I
have
also
found
that
the
process
of
becoming
a
good
writer
takes
much
time
and
effort
as
well.
I
know
that
I
am
on
the
right
path
so
far,
and
I
hope
that
I
can
use
my
experiences
as
a
WA
not
only
to
help
others
become
better
writers,
but
also
to
help
shape
and
improve
my
own
writing
style.
