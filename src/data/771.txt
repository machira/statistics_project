Being
a
WA:
The
Hawk
Chronicles
An
unsuccessful
WA
conference
involves
periods
of
silence,
punctuated
with
the
occasional
turn
of
a
stapled
sheaf
of
papers
and
the
shuffle
of
feet
crossing
and
uncrossing
and
hands
being
indiscreetly
wiped
down
on
denim.
True
story.
My
hardest
WA
conference
was
during
my
first
semester
on
the
job.
A
rookie
WA
with
next
to
no
on-the-job
experience,
I
was
confronted
with
the
most
unwieldy
and
uncooperative
student
I
have
yet
to
encounter
in
Pardee
319.
He
came
with
the
classically
uninterested
look,
the
derisive
scorn
that
so
aptly
conveyed
the
young
manOs
many
shades
of
boredom,
and
a
draft
that
was
very
obviously
a
hastily-cobbled
together
single
sheet
of
nothing
useful.
NWhat
am
I
supposed
to
do
with
this?O
I
thought
to
myself,
sitting
across
the
table
from
him
and
dreading
the
next
twenty-seven
minutes
that
I
had
to
while
away
in
a
somewhat
fruitful
manner.
NHow
am
I
supposed
to
help
him?O
Confronted
with
such
resistance,
I
did
not
know
how
to
proceed.
My
questions
elicited
monosyllabic
responses.
The
statement
NI
kind
of
just
wrote
whatever
because
this
is
a
first
draftO
was
casually
peppered
throughout
the
(extremely)
forced
conversation
with
reckless
abandon.
How
could
I
get
this
student,
who
had
missed
three
of
his
four
conferences
and
never
replied
to
a
single
of
my
reminder
emails,
to
care
about
his
FYS
paper
when
he
clearly
wanted
to
be
anywhere
but
the
Writing
Center?
What
words
could
I
possibly
say,
what
insightful
comments
could
I
possibly
shoot
his
way
that
would
straighten
out
his
slouch
and
bring
that
glimmer
of
engagement
to
his
eyes?
That
fall
I
faced
my
most
resounding
defeat
on
the
job,
but
it
was
one
failure
in
a
year
of
mostly
successes.
That
particularly
challenging
experience
has
put
into
greater
perspective
the
rest
of
my
mostly
great
conferences
(and
the
occasional
frustrated
outburst
as
yet
another
student
cancelled,
or
rescheduled
at
the
last
minute),
conferences
that
only
gave
me
a
newfound
respect
for
the
writing
process
but
also
helped
define
for
me
what
a
successful
conference
meant
to
me.
A
successful
WA
conference
is
bursting
at
the
seams
with
conversation.
Yes,
the
papers
shuffle
and
the
occasional
staple
pops
open
and
goes
flying
across
the
matte
surface
of
the
table.
Yes,
skin
comes
in
contact
with
denim
and
canvas
as
hands
reach
into
the
backpacks
and
purses
to
retrieve
textbooks
and
sources.
The
volume
level
oscillates,
as
fellow
occupants
of
Pardee
319
shoot
disapproving
glances
your
way
and
the
occasional
harried
coworker
asks
if
you
could
please
keep
it
down
(thank
you).
Sometimes
a
conference
can
spill
into
the
next
hour.
Thirty-five,
forty
minutes
later
youOre
still
sitting
there
D
sipping
from
your
Nalgene,
scribbling
down
a
flow
chart
on
the
flip
side
of
the
conference
sheet
because
there
are
just
so
many
ideas
and
so
many
ways
to
begin.
Sometimes
the
conference
can
end
with
no
single
solution
in
mind,
but
a
boatload
of
ideas.
When
the
chairs
scrape
back
against
the
carpet
and
the
student
shuffles
together
her
myriad
notes
(and
the
conference
sheet,
naturally)
and
says,
NThat
was
very
helpfulO
D
thatOs
the
warmest,
fuzziest
feeling
I
get
as
a
Writing
Associate.
When
I
started
off
as
a
rookie
WA
only
two
semesters
ago,
I
was
full
of
nervous
energy.
Conferences
boiled
down
to
hitting
every
point
on
my
bulleted
checklist.
Rough
drafts
were
returned
to
Professor
RinehartOs
apprehensive
First
Year
Seminar
students
with
copious
amounts
of
scribbling
in
the
margins.
Sentence
structure
errors,
misplaced
commas,
improper
punctuation
D
everything
was
subject
to
fierce
scrutiny
at
my
end.
I
have
a
sneaking
suspicion
that
my
(somewhat)
manic
method
of
proof-reading
gave
my
students
more
reason
for
concern
than
necessary.
In
retrospect,
that
was
mostly
unnecessary.
The
disconnect
between
my
expectations
and
reality
was
my
own
doing.
I
expected
perfection
from
these
first-years,
holding
them
to
the
same
standard
of
writing
that
I
held
myself.
What
a
rookie
mistake,
these
assumptions
about
writing
and
critical
analysis
skills
that
I
applied
with
such
liberal
strokes
to
this
handful
of
(mostly)
first-time
NseriousO
writers.
NWhat
do
you
mean
you
donOt
know
what
an
MLA
citation
is?O
I
often
wanted
to
ask
them,
conveniently
confining
to
a
dark
recess
of
my
mind
that
moment
of
utter
terror
four
years
ago
when
my
tenth-grade
English
teacher
had
derided
my
inability
to
comprehend
what
a
thesis
statement
was.
Writing
comes
as
second
nature
to
me.
Yet
being
a
Writing
Associate
was
not
nearly
as
intuitive.
Words
and
sentences
and
thesis
statements
and
arguments
that
followed
a
logical
flow
were
just
part
and
parcel
of
my
experience
as
an
English/FAMS
major,
and
since
I
had
not
often
encountered
people
in
the
midst
of
their
own
writing
process
I
could
not
entirely
understand
what
the
struggle
was
about.
As
a
first-semester
WA,
however,
I
was
speaking
to
a
group
comprised
of
mostly
math
and
engineering
and
physics
in
a
vernacular
that
didnOt
quite
register
with
them.
Throwing
out
phrases
like
Ncontextual
evidenceO
and
Npassive
sentence
structureO
without
altering
my
communication
to
suit
the
individual
was
mostly
useless.
Instead
of
asking,
NWhat
do
you
think
would
make
a
better
argument?O
I
was
saying,
NYour
sentence
structure
doesnOt
make
senseO
(internally,
I
was
also
adding
a
slightly
more
derisive
NHave
you
not
heard
of
subject/verb
agreement
yet?O).
I
soon
came
to
realize
that
peer-reviewing
someone
elseOs
writing
refused
to
follow
the
progression
that
my
own
creative
process
did,
that
the
creative
process
varied
from
student
to
student.
That
even
the
staunchest
anti-writing
writers
had
a
creative
process
was
such
a
revelation
that
it
gave
me
a
whole
new
factor
to
think
about
when
I
sat
down
to
WA
a
studentOs
paper.
My
style
of
WA-ing
went
from
direct
and
corrective
to
facilitative.
(Mostly)
gone
were
the
blunt
NThis
paragraph
needs
to
goO
and
NThatOs
a
comma
splice
right
there.O
Initially,
I
felt
compelled
to
point
out
sloppy
sentences
and
copy-editing
errors
because
thatOs
what
I
thought
a
good
WA
did.
A
glorified
proofreader
D
thatOs
what
I
thought
my
job
entailed.
I
was
rather
wrong.
As
the
semester
went
on
I
found
myself
juggling
multiple
roles:
Bi-Weekly
Calendar,
Occasional
Secretary,
and
Conference
Counselor,
to
name
a
few.
Yes,
I
would
still
cast
a
gimlet
eye
on
LOCs
like
grammatical
errors.
I
would
occasionally
perform
internal
face-palms
if
a
student
brought
a
second
draft
that
was
identical
to
the
first
one,
sans
the
few
minor
mistakes
that
IOd
pointed
out
earlier.
NIs
that
the
point
of
a
WA
conference?O
I
would
be
tempted
to
ask,
but
that
was
not
my
job.
My
job
was
teasing
out
their
creative
juices,
enabling
to
flesh
out
those
ideas
that
lurked
in
the
crevices
of
their
minds
by
asking
them
those
questions
that
got
their
cogs
turning.
Enter
the
facilitative
approach.
NWhatOs
your
creative
process?O
I
later
came
to
ask.
Not
that
all
students
know
immediately
how
to
answer
that
query.
Some
would
stare
back
at
me
blankly.
NIOm
not
a
creative
person,O
others
would
say.
One
student
in
the
film
theory
class
that
I
WA-ed
for
told
me
bluntly
that
he
NwasnOt
much
of
a
writer.O
His
resistance,
I
came
to
understand,
came
not
only
from
the
difficulty
of
the
prompt
and
the
unwieldy
nature
of
Maya
DerenOs
notion
of
a
Ncontrolled
accident.O
It
stemmed
from
a
lack
of
confidence
in
his
ability
to
creatively
express
his
opinion,
his
thoughts.
Yes,
as
a
mechanical
engineering
student
he
was
more
engrossed
with
numbers
and
the
science
of
circuits.
But
his
conversations
gave
me
insight
on
the
multitude
of
ideas
that
were
running
rampant
in
his
head,
gossamer
strands
of
thought
that
could
be
cobbled
together
to
form
that
all-elusive
cohesive
argument
that
he
was
so
intently
seeking.
That
was
one
of
the
first
times
that
I
had
stopped
a
student
mid-sentence
to
say,
NWell,
why
donOt
you
just
write
that?O
after
he
had
spent
a
good
five
minutes
telling
me
his
opinion
on
the
filmic
application
of
the
Ncontrolled
accident.O
NI
didnOt
think
I
could,O
he
said,
somewhat
taken
aback
D
and
a
collaborative
relationship
was
born.
That
collaboration
could
become
such
a
cornerstone
of
a
successful
WA
conference
was
also
something
I
had
not
anticipated.
I
came
to
see
that
I
didnOt
need
to
show
off
my
writing
prowess
by
using
words
straight
out
of
an
SAT
prep
book.
I
didnOt
have
to
circle
every
other
subject/verb
disagreement
and
misplaced
comma
for
my
student
to
realize
that
something
didnOt
flow
right.
NRead
it
out
to
me,O
I
would
say,
or
NHow
does
that
sound
to
you?O
That
glimmer
of
comprehension
that
would
dawn
in
their
eyes
was
validation
enough
that
I
was
getting
through
to
them,
in
whatever
capacity
was
possible.
Then
we
would
talk
about
it,
slowly
dismantling
the
University
of
highbrow
vocabulary
and
convoluted
sentence
structures
to
create
something
more
organic,
more
reflective
of
the
dialog
that
each
student
had
with
the
prompt.
Before
I
become
a
WA,
I
didnOt
quite
see
my
own
creative
process
as
a
product
of
collaboration.
If
anything,
writing
was
an
elaborate
process
of
brainstorming
and
consulting
multiple
sources
and
having
mini-meltdowns
at
various
points
in
the
paper.
Sure,
I
often
bolted
to
my
professorsO
office
hours
the
moment
I
turned
in
a
first
draft
and
was
wracked
with
anxiety
that
my
work
would
not
live
up
to
my
own
exacting
standard
of
perfection.
Sure,
I
have
had
many
a
forty-five
minute
long
conversation
about
this
idea
and
that
paragraph
that
needed
tweaking
and
rewording
and
reconfiguring.
I
would
drink
up
the
feedback
and
get
to
work,
churning
out
draft
after
draft
that
was
cobbled
together
in
the
aftermath
of
highly
fruitful
conversations
with
my
teachers.
Yet
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
what
I
was
thriving
on
was
actually
peer-reviewing,
the
very
kind
of
collaboration
that
our
Writing
Center
so
enthusiastically
tries
to
foster.
I
fly
solo,
gosh
darn
it!
IOd
told
myself,
and
then
I
became
a
Writing
Associate
and
two
semester
and
innumerable
first
(and
second,
and
third)
drafts
later
I
stood
corrected.
The
creative
process
did
not
happen
in
a
vacuum:
from
in-class
discussions
to
optional
(ahem)
conferences
with
professors
to
the
frantic
flagging
down
of
objective
readers
at
12:54AM
at
the
library,
my
writing
was
informed
by
it
all.
So
many
facets
went
into
creating
one
halfway-decent
paper,
and
yet
I
had
been
seeing
the
whole
ordeal
through
the
skewed
lens
of
Things
I
Have
Achieved
on
My
Own.
I
may
have
embraced
the
collaborative
aspect
of
my
job,
but
I
am
still
terrified
of
having
my
own
work
reviewed
by
someone
elseOs
discerning
eyes.
This
is
one
of
the
greatest
ironies
of
my
job
as
a
WA:
I
am
perfectly
capable
of
providing
feedback
on
othersO
work,
but
the
moment
the
table
is
turned
on
me
I
am
mere
moments
away
from
a
hyperventilation
attack.
The
moment
I
slide
my
(heavily
redone)
first
draft
across
the
table
and
the
sheaf
of
papers
gets
snatched
up
by
my
(official
or
otherwise)
WA,
I
am
a
nervous
wreck.
Did
I
correct
all
the
comma
splices?
Does
my
argument
make
sense?
Is
my
tone
painfully
passive?
What
about
the
fragments?
Did
I
integrate
my
in-text
citations
fluidly?
I
sit
there
and
panic,
internally,
as
the
person
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
flips
pages
and
makes
occasional
notations
in
the
margin.
Regardless
of
the
outcome,
regardless
of
the
feedback
that
concludes
the
conversation,
I
cannot
help
internally
WA-ing
my
own
papers.
No
facilitative
approach
employed
there,
oh
no.
ItOs
straight
up
directive,
corrective,
and
sometimes
a
crippling
plunge
into
self-criticism.
If
I
could,
I
would
attend
conferences
with
my
own
WA
with
a
paper
bag
over
my
head
(and
a
sad
smiley
drawn
on
it
for
good
measure).
I
wonOt
resort
to
that,
though.
Nor
do
I
expect
myself
to
dive
into
my
second
year
of
being
a
WA
by
bringing
my
own
expectations
of
Ngood
writingO
to
the
table.
I
am
learning
to
relax
those
exacting
standards
of
perfection.
I
am
learning
to
recognize
that
a
first
draft
is
just
that:
a
draft.
I
am
learning
to
recognize
that
not
all
comma
splices
jump
out
at
you
on
the
first
proofread,
that
not
all
content
fits
snugly
together
like
so
many
well-worn
jigsaw
pieces.
I
am
learning
to
recognize,
and
embrace,
this
organic
process
that
is
writing.
I
am
acquainting
myself
with
forgiving
minor
oversights,
and
looking
past
the
surface
to
get
to
the
buried
treasure
that
is
the
thinking
process
behind
every
(hastily
cobbled
together
and
otherwise)
paper.
