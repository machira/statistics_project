Returning
Writing
Associates
When
I
think
about
the
writing
I
ve
been
doing
for
the
past
year,
I
think
most
about
my
recent
return
to
more
creative
techniques
of
writing,
especially
in
academic
areas.
The
past
three
years
of
college
have
transformed
my
writing
in
a
lot
of
different
ways.
Most
of
these
changes
have
been
pretty
pleasant.
I
still
get
that
strange
feeling
of
progress
when
my
face
becomes
beet
red
after
reading
an
old
high
school
English
paper.
Unfortunately,
not
all
of
these
changes
have
been
necessarily
progressive.
What
seemed
to
bother
me
most
about
my
writing
this
year
was
my
reluctance
to
let
loose,
to
liberate
the
words
on
the
piece
of
paper,
to
forget
about
being
so
stilted
with
my
pen.
I
began
realizing
that
some
of
my
best
ideas
came
to
me
when
I
wasn't
worrying
about
transition
sentences
or
split
infinitives.
After
all,
if
you
really
don't
have
anything
worth
writing
about,
who's
really
going
to
care
if
you
leave
your
participles
dangling?
During
this
past
year,
I've
started
to
write
most
of
my
papers
with
these
sort
of
explosive
brainstorming
sessions.
These
explosion
sessions
often
produce
some
of
the
best
ideas
I've
had
so
far
in
my
writing
experiences.
I
start
with
a
simple
observation,
something
so
uncomplicated
that
it
just
might
be
more
complex
than
it
appears
at
first
glance.
Take
this
particular
writing
associate
paper,
for
example.
I
couldn't
really
begin
at
the
beginning
because
I
can't
remember
when
exactly
that
beginning
began.
.
.(Hmmm).
So
rather
than
just
throwing
my
hands
up
in
the
air,
I
began
with
what
seemed
obvious,
to
me
anyway.
I
wrote
down
memory
pieces
from
the
past
year
and
filled
in
all
of
the
details
gaps
and
transitions
after
I
had
the
basics
right
in
front
of
me.
Many,
many
years
ago,
writers
all
over
the
world
may
have
discovered
for
themselves
that
these
simple
techniques
make
it
much
easier
to
begin
writing
than
to
approach
a
topic
in
a
more
organized
manner
with
paragraph
1
and
so
on.
Or
maybe
most
people
really
admire
and
strive
for
organization
and
can't
stand
to
see
a
bunch
of
random
words
flying
around
on
a
piece
of
paper.
For
me,
however,
trial
and
error
has
proven
to
me
that
the
initial
arrangement
of
the
pieces
does
not
have
a
significant
effect
on
the
quality
of
the
final
product.
This
trial
and
error
writing
technique
has
also
helped
me
with
my
work
outside
of
the
classroom.
For
the
past
year
I've
been
working
off-campus
as
an
assistant
editor
for
An
Encyclopedia
of
British
Women
Writers.
This
editing
job
has
allowed
to
learn
from
others-
their
stupid
and
not-so-stupid
mistakes.
As
I
correct
their
mistakes,
I
think
I'm
also
correcting
many
specific
mistakes
in
my
own
writing.
Creative
brainstorming
and
trial
and
error
are
not
the
only
things
that
have
helped
me
to
improve
my
writing
this
year.
I
guess
my
most
memorable
writing
experience
of
this
past
year
would
be
the
research
paper
I
presented
on
Native
American
literature
last
April.
The
research
paper
was
a
culmination
of
an
independent
study
in
which
I
participated
this
spring
with
three
other
students.
Throughout
this
independent
study,
we
examined
a
variety
of
aspects
of
Native
American
culture.
The
main
purpose
of
these
examinations
was
to
gain
further
knowledge
of
the
Native
American
people
we
would
be
working
with
in
March.
The
four
of
us
shared
our
writings
and
observations
with
our
adviser
and
each
other.
While
there
were
inevitably
a
number
of
heated
arguments,
the
freedom
of
this
individualized
atmosphere
allowed
us
to
openly
respond
to
each
other,
to
ask
real
questions
without
unnecessary
hesitations.
Before
we
left
for
the
Alternative
School
Break
trip
to
a
Pima-
Maracopa
reservation
in
Arizona,
we
had
to
write
a
number
of
journal
entries
and
reading
responses.
These
writing
assignments
allowed
each
of
us
to
openly
express
our
expectations
of
the
upcoming
trip
and
to
tell
one
another
what
we
had
been
learning
in
our
individualized
projects.
I
chose
to
focus
my
individual
research
on
Native
American
contemporary
fiction,
particularly
on
those
works
of
Native
American
novelist
Louise
Erdrich.
More
specifically,
I
looked
at
the
relationship
between
landscape
and
Native
American
identity
in
the
novels,
Tracks
and
Love
Medicine.
At
the
end
of
the
spring
semester,
all
four
of
us
shared
our
research
with
Lafayette
students
and
faculty
at
a
brown
bag
on
Native
American
tradition,
poetry,
contemporary
fiction,
and
spiritual
life.
The
research
I
did
for
this
independent
study
sparked
my
curiosity
even
more.
I
started
to
read
the
works
of
other
Native
American
authors
and
to
learn
more
about
the
cultural
and
religious
implications
of
their
works.
I
decided
to
continue
doing
research
in
this
area
in
the
fall
and
hope
to
develop
my
findings
into
an
honors
thesis
on
depictions
of
the
mixed-blood
in
Native
American
literature.
I've
already
realized
that
such
a
task
requires
more
researching
and
writing
than
I
ever
could
have
imagined
when
I
started
pursuing
my
interests.
During
the
fall
semester,
I
was
assigned
to
be
a
Writing
Associate
for
a
modern
drama
class.
Because
I
wasn't
given
any
supplemental
readings
or
background
information,
it
was
difficult
to
answer
the
students'
questions
about
the
books.
Even
though
I
was
able
to
give
the
students
suggestions
to
improve
their
writing,
I
think
I
could
have
helped
them
improve
the
expression
of
ideas
in
their
papers
if
I
had
had
some
additional
background
material.
I
had
a
lot
of
difficulty
trying
to
separate
the
writing
from
the
content.
I
probably
shouldn't
be
trying
to
separate
them
in
the
first
place.
Last
semester,
I
was
also
a
Writing
Associate
for
a
VAST
class
on
Darwinism.
Fortunately,
the
professor
provided
me
with
excerpts
of
a
variety
of
reading
assignments.
This
allowed
me
to
prepare
myself
before
conferences,
to
make
more
informed
comments
about
the
students'
papers.
The
students
seemed
to
listen
more
to
my
advice
on
their
writing
when
they
knew
that
I
had
been
reading
some
of
the
same
things
on
which
their
papers
were
based.
The
conferences
often
went
overtime.
I
didn't
mind
because
I
knew
that
I
was
giving
them
ideas
they
would
actually
use
when
revising
their
papers.
I
made
sure
that
I
was
clear
about
the
assignment
by
discussing
it
with
the
professor
before
I
met
with
any
of
the
students.
Surprisingly,
one
of
the
biggest
problems
that
these
students
were
having
was
trying
to
figure
out
what
they
were
supposed
to
be
writing
about
in
the
first
place.
Because
I
took
classes
last
semester
that
required
a
lot
of
writing,
I
think
I
learned
more
about
my
own
writing
than
I
had
in
previous
years.
I'm
eager
to
continue
writing
as
much
as
possible
this
year
in
preparation
for
graduate
school.
I've
been
realizing
that
writing
isn't
the
only
way
in
which
I
can
express
myself.
I
just
happen
to
think
that
it's
the
most
powerful
and
most
enjoyable
way
I've
found
thus
far.
