A
Lifetime
of
Writing
Memories
of
my
first
attempt
to
write
go
hand-in-hand
with
those
of
my
second
grade
year
at
a
Catholic
elementary
school
in
Virginia.
I
remember
painstakingly
trying
to
make
the
perfect
cursive
letters
on
a
piece
of
yellow
paper,
amid
a
series
of
dotted
and
solid
lines.
In
those
early
days,
oversized
pencils
were
popular
among
second
graders,
and
they
became
my
tool
of
choice.
Along
with
fat
pencils
and
yellow
paper
with
exaggerated
lines,
second
grade
was
the
year
of
the
phonic
books.
With
the
aid
of
these
books
I
began
to
learn
how
to
"sound
out"
words.
With
these
words
we
had
to
create
sentences--
ten
of
them
each
week.
These
sentences
constituted
my
first
serious
attempts
at
writing.
As
was
common
in
my
early
childhood
years,
a
new
school
year
brought
me
to
a
new
school,
this
time
a
public
school
in
Maryland.
I
remember
very
little
from
Mrs.
Coleman's
third
grade
class.
The
one
incident
that
I
do
remember
is
due
only
to
the
fact
that
it
has
become
one
of
my
mother's
favorite
anecdotes.
It
seems
that
the
students
were
asked
to
write
about
what
we
would
be
giving
thanks
for
on
the
upcoming
Thanksgiving
Day.
When
my
mom
visited
my
classroom
for
a
routine
parent-teacher
conference,
she
spotted
my
little
essay
hanging
on
the
wall
with
all
of
the
others,
just
outside
of
the
classroom
door.
She
could
not
help
laughing
when
she
read
what
I
had
written:
"On
this
day
we
ask
God
to
bless
the
poor,
the
hungry,
the
homeless
and
other
relatives."
She
felt
that
she
needed
to
explain
to
my
teacher
that
our
"other
relatives"
did
not
fall
into
the
categories
of
poor,
hungry,
or
homeless,
as
I
had
unwittingly
implied
by
the
structuring
of
my
sentence.
Even
though
I
was
young
and
inexperienced
at
writing,
I
learned
from
that
day
to
think
before
I
wrote,
and
to
make
sure
that
everything
I
wrote
made
sense.
One
other
memory
remains
with
me
from
third
grade.
In
my
class
was
a
girl
named
Jaime,
who
would
be
my
best
friend
for
many
years.
We
shared
just
about
everything,
including
a
passion
for
reading.
On
rainy
summer
days,
when
we
finally
bored
of
reading,
we
would
grab
our
pens
and
paper
and
attempt
to
write
our
own
stories.
They
were
childish
stories
about
young
girls
who
usually
held
the
coveted
position
of
protected
little
sister,
and
who
had
names
like
Alex
or
Sam.
They
were
stories
about
girls
who
were
taking
their
first
adolescent
steps
toward
adventure
and
independence.
Although
we
rarely
even
got
passed
chapter
one,
we
had
high
ambitions
for
our
coming-of-age
novels.
Jaime's
father
worked
as
an
editor
and
we
counted
on
his
ability
to
publish
any
words
of
wisdom
that
we
wrote.
Never
mind
the
fact
that
his
publishing
company
only
published
phone
books
and
other
such
directories.
With
my
"graduation"
from
elementary
school
and
promotion
to
junior
high
came
the
first
of
many
years
of
research
reports.
The
earliest
stages
of
these
reports
were
often
reiterated
from
the
World
Book
Encyclopedia
with
just
enough
words
changed
and
sentences
shuffled
to
avoid
plagiarism.
Later
came
the
use
of
primary
sources,
which
required
more
analytical
and
comprehensive
reading
skills.
I
have
a
difficult
time
remembering
the
academic
parts
of
my
earliest
years
of
high
school
Perhaps
the
social
side
has
eclipsed
all
else
in
my
mind,
because
I
can
still
tell
you
who
was
dating
whom
and
what
the
latest
fads
were.
There
is,
however,
one
class
from
my
senior
year
that
remains
fresh
in
my
mind--Ms.
Peckham's
Advanced
Placement
English
class.
The
work
load
for
AP
English
began
on
the
last
day
of
my
junior
year.
As
a
summer
assignment
we
were
required
to
read
Wuthering
Heights
and
keep
a
journal
of
the
characters
and
settings
of
the
novel.
We
also
had
to
write
a
plot
summery
and
compare
and
contrast
a
number
of
characters.
In
hopes
of
improving
our
vocabulary,
Ms.
Peckham
required
us
to
define
any
words
that
we
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
and
use
them
in
a
sentence.
Finally,
we
had
to
choose
three
sentences
from
each
chapter
that
really
spoke
to
us
and
explain
why,
whether
it
was
because
of
content
or
style.
The
assignment
due
date
was
set
for
the
first
day
of
class
our
senior
year.
Because
I
had
experienced
Ms.
Peckham's
9th
grade
class,
I
knew
that
she
held
high
expectations.
After
procrastinating
on
many
assignments
throughout
my
first
three
years
of
high
school,
I
decided
to
get
started
on
this
one
right
away.
The
very
first
day
of
summer
I
began
rereading
Wuthering
Heights.
(I
had
already
read
it
for
pleasure
several
times.)
With
the
help
of
our
family
computer
I
set
up
journals
and
spreadsheets
to
keep
track
of
the
required
information.
I
was
on
my
way
to
a
carefree
summer
with
this
time
consuming
project
behind
me
when
technical
disaster
struck.
I
cannot
even
estimate
how
far
along
in
the
project
I
was
when
my
computer
crashed.
That
day
introduced
me
to
the
concept
of
back-up
disks--something
I
had,
unfortunately,
been
unaware
of
before.
And
so
it
was
back
to
step
one.
In
the
end,
all
of
the
work
payed
off,
though,
because
I
received
the
highest
grade
of
all
Ms.
Peckham's
AP
classes.
It
was,
however,
the
last
time
that
I
did
anything
directly
on
the
computer.
To
this
day,
I
usually
hand
write
my
papers
and
then
type
them
after
I
have
all
of
my
ideas
on
paper.
Throughout
the
year
Ms.
Peckham
taught
me
some
very
important
lessons.
The
first
remains
with
me
each
and
every
time
that
I
put
pen
to
paper
or
fingers
to
keyboard.
"To
be"
verbs
are
boring.
Sometimes
they
cannot
be
avoided.
Many
times,
however,
restructuring
a
sentence
to
avoid
the
use
of
is,
was,
are,
etc.,
makes
for
a
much
more
descriptive
sentence
that
holds
the
reader's
attention
better.
Another
important
lesson
I
learned
in
AP
English
pertained
to
my
specific
writing
talents.
For
years
teachers
praised
my
writing
and
analytical
skills.
One
teacher
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
my
writing
was
more
like
that
of
a
colleague
than
a
student.
Yet
every
paper
I
turned
in
came
back
riddled
with
red
ink
pointing
out
spelling
mistakes,
omitted
words,
and
other
general
editing
mistakes.
Yet
I
always
managed
to
receive
A's
on
those
same
papers.
But
not
in
Ms.
Peckham's
class.
She
taught
me
that
analyzing
and
comprehending
is
just
half
the
battle.
She
always
said
that
ideas
are
worthless
if
one
is
unable
to
communicate
them
in
a
comprehendible
way.
I
could
no
longer
earn
A's
on
essentially
sloppy
papers.
As
a
result,
I
became
much
more
careful
about
what
I
wrote
and
how
I
wrote
it.
As
I
began
editing
my
papers
more
carefully,
I
found
that
I
had
quite
a
knack
for
it,
and
that
it
proved
less
boring
and
mundane
than
I
had
imagined.
Maybe
Ms.
Peckham
planted
the
seed
in
the
back
of
my
mind
which
has
made
me
lean
toward
editing
as
a
career.
Here
I
must
go
off
on
a
brief
aside
for
my
mother's
sake.
For
a
while,
in
junior
high
and
high
school,
I
let
my
mother
edit
my
papers.
She,
however,
frustrated
me,
because
like
Ms.
Peckham
would
years
later,
my
mom
looked
not
only
at
what
I
said
but
at
how
I
said
it.
It
made
her
so
mad
that
teachers
gave
me
A's
on
papers
that
did
not
deserve
them.
For
a
while
I
did
not
let
her
read
any
papers
until
I
had
gotten
them
back
graded.
Ms.
Peckham's
higher
standards
seemed
like
a
dream
come
true
for
my
mom.
Maybe
if
I
had
listened
to
her
to
begin
with,
I
would
have
learned
this
lesson
long
before
AP
English.
Ms.
Peckham
devoted
her
career
to
preparing
her
students
for
college
writing.
I
believe
that,
in
my
case
at
least,
she
succeeded.
College
writing
definitely
challenged
me,
but
it
did
not
overwhelm
me.
My
first
major
writing
class
at
Lafayette
was
my
first
year
seminar.
I
like
the
idea
of
this
kind
of
environment--a
small
class
based
on
a
common
interest
of
the
students
and,
of
course,
based
on
writing.
It
introduces
students
to
the
expectations
of
college
writing
without
being
intimidating,
as
a
large
lecture
class
can
sometimes
be.
As
well
prepared
as
I
was,
I
did
have
to
adjust
a
little.
The
length
of
the
papers
tended
to
be
longer
than
those
I
had
written
in
high
school,
which
meant
that
I
had
to
develop
my
ideas
more
and
use
more
details.
Also,
I
have
found
that
professors
often
give
much
broader
topics
to
write
about
and
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
student
to
narrow
the
topic
of
a
paper
from
the
broad
to
the
specific.
In
high
school,
paper
topics
were
usually
very
specific,
leaving
little
room
for
interpretation.
Sometimes
the
vagueness
of
the
original
assignment
led
to
problems
for
me.
More
than
once
during
my
college
career
the
following
situation
has
happened
to
me.
After
spending
weeks
working
on
a
paper
(I
no
longer
procrastinate
at
all
when
it
comes
to
papers)
a
professor
would
suddenly
get
much
more
specific
with
the
topic,
giving
us
lists
of
questions
that
we
should
answer
and
ideas
that
we
should
touch
upon
in
our
papers.
Unfortunately,
not
just
one
professor
has
subjected
me
to
this.
If
it
were
just
one
professor,
I
could
be
prepared
and
know
to
ask
him
or
her
for
more
specific
guidelines,
but
with
different
professors
doing
this
I
feel
as
though
I
should
not
start
my
paper
until
the
last
minute
for
fear
of
having
to
rewrite
and
restructure
the
whole
thing
anyway.
My
worst
writing
experience
came
my
sophomore
year
during
my
"Literary
Questions"
class.
My
professor
gave
the
most
general
topics,
saying
"Choose
a
book
we've
read,
pick
a
topic
within
that
book,
and
write
about
it."
Keep
in
mind
that
this
class
was
primarily
devoted
to
different
interpretations
of
literature.
We
read
under
the
theory
that
black
and
white,
right
and
wrong
interpretations
almost
never
exist
in
literature.
The
first
paper
that
I
turned
in
laid
right
in
the
middle
of
the
road
as
far
as
interpretations
go.
I
agreed
a
lot
with
the
most
popular
interpretation,
which
subsequently
my
professor
also
agreed
with.
I
received
a
B+
on
that
first
paper.
When
our
next
paper
for
the
class
rolled
around
I
decided
to
be
a
little
more
creative
and
daring.
I
chose
a
less
popular
interpretation
and
developed
it
with
my
own
ideas.
I
took
this
paper
in
its
early
stages
to
my
professor
and
she
seemed
to
like
my
ideas.
I
loved
that
paper.
I
still
believe
that
it
is
one
of
the
most
well
thought
out,
well
structured
papers
that
I
have
ever
written.
I
really
felt
that
I
had
worked
hard
on
it,
and
when
it
came
time
to
turn
it
in,
I
had
no
regrets
or
doubts
that
I
could
have
done
better.
A
few
weeks
later
my
paper
came
back
with
a
B-.
When
I
asked
my
professor
why
this
paper,
which
was
obviously
better
than
my
first,
had
gotten
a
lower
grade,
her
answer
shocked
me.
She
actually
said
that
my
paper
had
a
lot
of
good,
well-developed
ideas
in
it
and
that
I
supported
those
ideas
well,
but
that
she
did
not
agree
with
my
interpretation.
So
much
for
no
right
or
wrong
interpretations.
For
the
third
and
final
paper
of
the
class
I
basically
wrote
exactly
what
I
knew
my
professor
wanted
to
read.
I
did
not
deviate
at
all
from
her
interpretation.
I
was
not
very
enthusiastic
about
the
paper
and
it
showed
in
my
writing,
yet
I
received
an
A+
for
it.
Afterwards
I
could
have
kicked
myself
for
giving
in
like
that,
but
at
the
time
I
felt
that
I
could
not
afford
a
B
in
the
class.
I
did
learn
from
this
bad
experience,
however.
I
learned
that
I
should
not
back
down
from
my
beliefs
just
to
satisfy
others.
It
does
not
seem
like
a
major
crime
in
a
college
paper,
but
what
if
professional
journalists
backed
down
to
please
others?
If
Woodward
and
Bernstein
had
backed
down
under
pressure,
one
of
the
biggest
White
House
scandals
in
history
would
never
have
been
brought
to
justice.
I
also
learned
that
even
in
the
worst
experiences
there
is
something
to
be
learned.
Some
of
the
best
experiences
in
writing
came
just
this
summer.
As
an
intern
for
a
small
publishing
company
my
jobs
vary
from
office
work
to
editing.
The
company
puts
out
several
publications,
many
of
them
for
nonprofit
organizations
and
free
magazines.
Earlier
in
the
summer
the
owner
and
editor-in-chief
of
the
company
asked
me
to
edit
her
Editor's
letter
in
our
newest
and
most
exciting
magazine.
At
first
I
thought
she
meant
for
me
to
proofread
her
letter
for
typos
and
spelling
mistakes,
a
job
I
had
done
many
times
before.
But
then
she
told
me
to
change,
omit,
and
add
anywhere
that
I
felt
needed
"help."
Here
was
a
woman
with
some
20
years
of
experience
asking
me,
who
had
almost
no
experience,
to
edit
something
that
she
had
written.
Of
course,
the
letter
needed
very
little
editing,
but
I
was
still
honored
that
she
thought
me
capable
of
the
job,
and
she
praised
me
for
the
job
that
I
did.
Another
exciting
experience
with
the
company
came
just
last
week.
As
usual
the
office
was
hectic
in
an
attempt
to
make
our
deadlines.
In
this
case
we
had
to
get
the
Ronald
McDonald
House
Baltimore
Pro-Am
Golf
Tournament
programs
to
the
printer
by
noon
the
following
day.
Amid
all
the
confusion
no
one
had
remembered
to
write
up
the
biographies
of
the
professional
golfers,
and
the
job
fell
to
me.
I
had
to
search
through
a
big
book
about
golfers
and
condense
their
professional
lives
from
the
two
to
three
pages
in
the
book
to
about
eight
sentences
for
the
program.
This
was
a
somewhat
difficult
task
for
me,
because
I
know
nothing
about
golf
and
could
not
be
sure
whether
saying
someone
had
nine
top-25
finishes
over
a
15
year
career
would
be
a
compliment
or
an
insult.
And,
since
this
was
a
charity
event
which
the
pros
were
taking
time
off
to
do,
I
had
to
make
each
golfer
look
like
the
best
in
the
sport,
even
though
some
of
them
were
so
bad
they
had
no
business
being
on
a
pro
tour.
The
task
challenged
my
writing
skills
and
was
a
lot
of
fun
to
do,
and
now
some
5,000
people
will
be
reading
my
bios
on
some
of
the
world's
top
golfers.
And
that
brings
me
to
my
upcoming
junior
year.
Hopefully
there
will
be
many
more
wonderful
experiences,
very
few
horrible
ones,
and
infinitely
more
lessons
to
be
learned.
