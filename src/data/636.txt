A
History
of
Writing-
Chapter
II
While
my
one
academic
year
spent
working
as
a
Writing
Associate
is
not
nearly
the
numerical
equivalent
of
the
15
or
so
other
years
I
have
spent
as
a
writer,
it
has
definitely
been
as
valuable
in
helping
me
improve
myself
as
a
writer.
Every
aspect
of
the
College
Writing
Program,
from
discussions
with
my
partner
professors
to
WA
conferences
with
students,
has
helped
me
attain
valuable
knowledge
to
develop
as
both
a
writer
and
a
critical
reader.
Being
a
WA
immersed
me
into
what
I
can
basically
best
describe
as
a
community
of
writing.
While
working
for
the
CWP,
I
was
surrounded
by
people
who
were
willing
to
discuss
any
aspect
of
writing.
I
could
go
to
the
program
coordinators
and
my-coworkers
for
advice.
I
would
create
dialogues
with
students
during
conferences
to
help
them
address
concerns
with
their
assignments
while
even
picking
up
a
few
pointers
for
myself
along
the
way.
Discussing
assignments
with
my
partner
professors
helped
me
gain
a
better
knowledge
of
what
qualities
college
professors
are
looking
for
in
what
they
consider
to
be
superior
academic
writing.
Working
at
the
drop-in
service
helped
expose
me
to
many
kinds
of
writing,
from
a
senior
thesis
that
was
nearing
triple
digits
in
page
numbers
to
a
one
page
personal
statement
for
a
scholarship
essay.
With
writing,
it
seems
like
any
exposure
is
good
exposure,
because
an
example
of
what
to
doNor
what
not
to
doNcan
be
taken
from
any
piece
of
writing.
The
aspect
of
being
a
WA
that
helped
me
evolve
the
most
as
a
writer
was,
surprisingly
to
me,
my
conferences
with
my
fellow
students.
In
giving
advice
to
them
I
also
found
that
I
was
advising
myself.
For
example,
I
would
notice
that
a
paragraph
in
a
paper
would
get
too
off-topic,
and
I
would
think,
NHey
I
did
that
in
a
paper
IOm
working
on
too.O
I
would
ask
a
student
what
strategies
he
or
she
was
trying
to
employ
in
his
or
her
paper
and
think
this
idea
would
be
a
good
idea
to
utilize
in
my
own
work.
On
the
other
hand,
I
saw
common
mistakes
or
awkward
words
or
phrases
that
disrupted
the
flow
of
the
paper,
and
I
learned
to
avoid
them.
During
conversations
with
students
I
would
pick
up
tips
on
how
to
be
a
better
writer.
If
I
saw
something
that
worked
well
in
a
paper,
I
would
as
the
student
how
he
or
she
arrived
at
that
idea.
If
there
was
something
that
I
thought
did
not
work
as
well,
I
would
try
to
guide
the
student
towards
revising
that
section
of
the
paper.
Often
times,
the
student
would
come
up
with
an
idea
or
suggestion
for
revision
that
I
had
not
thought
of
myself.
As
I
continued
to
conduct
more
and
more
conferences,
I
came
up
with
sort
of
a
mental
checklist
of
things
I
should
look
for
in
a
paper.
I
knew
the
paper
had
to
be
strong
in
such
elements
like
clarity,
organization,
structure,
on-target
for
the
assignment,
etc.
These
were
the
items
we
referred
to
as
the
Nhigher
order
concernsO
in
our
WA
meetings.
As
I
continued
to
train
myself
to
look
for
these
concerns,
I
found
it
easier
to
evaluate
my
own
writing.
When
I
was
reading
over
a
draft
for
my
own
assignmentNany
type
of
assignmentNI
began
to
immediately
notices
my
own
strengths
or
weaknesses
in
those
high
order
concern
areas.
I
was
able
to
approach
my
draft
almost
as
if
it
were
written
by
someone
else.
The
attention
to
the
high
order
concerns
also
helped
as
I
was
writing
the
actual
paper.
I
found
that
I
became
more
attentive
to
the
paperOs
flow
and
structure.
I
found
myself
checking
back
to
the
assignment
prompt
more
often
to
make
sure
I
was
not
straying
too
far
off
topic.
For
me,
writing
as
a
WA
meant
imagining
myself
as
the
one
getting
evaluated
in
the
student
conference.
I
found
myself
thinking
how
I
would
answer
the
questions
I
usually
posed
to
the
student
writers
in
my
conferences.
The
fact
that
I
got
to
look
at
various
types
of
assignments
helped
get
me
into
the
mindset
of
writing
for
different
audiences.
In
one
particular
class
for
which
I
was
the
WA,
the
teacher
had
an
interesting
assignment
where
the
students
were
supposed
to
chronicle
some
historical
event
in
the
development
of
the
city
of
Chicago.
Instead
of
just
rehashing
the
details
of
the
event,
the
professor
wanted
to
the
students
to
basically
tell
a
non-fiction
story
that
focused
on
a
main
character.
Conducting
conferences
about
this
assignment
was
very
challenging
for
me.
Some
students
picked
really
good
events
that
had
one
or
two
central
characters,
and
their
papers
really
read
like
stories.
Other
studentsO
assignments
read
too
much
like
research
papers.
As
someone
who
has
trouble
chronicling
historical
events
in
any
form
other
than
a
research
paper,
I
could
really
empathize
with
those
students.
As
I
read
more
and
more
of
the
papers,
I
was
able
to
better
find
opportunities
in
the
papers
for
the
students
to
expand
on
certain
events
or
situations
to
make
their
papers
read
more
like
stories.
I
was
able
to
take
these
lessons
from
this
unique
assignment
and
apply
it
to
my
writing
in
various
areas.
I
could
take
a
research
paper
and
make
it
more
interesting
by
inserting
some
key
facts
about
important
people.
I
even
went
back
through
some
creative
writing
I
didNall
fictionNand
was
able
to
find
parts
where
some
of
the
passages
read
like
a
boring
chronicling
of
an
event.
I
saw
more
opportunities
in
my
own
work
to
help
improve
the
overall
story
structure
and
to
make
my
papers
more
interesting
and
appealing
to
readers.
Another
interesting
assignment
that
influenced
me
as
a
writer
was
an
assignment
where
students
had
to
write
a
paper
analyzing
arguments
of
one
sideOs
stance
on
key
issues
like
global
warming
or
the
use
of
genetically
modified
crops.
Instead
of
just
doing
a
research
paper
to
compare
and
analyze
facts,
the
students
had
to
play
the
role
of
a
NskepticO
and
analyze
arguments
from
a
logical
sense.
The
students
had
to
look
at
what
people
were
saying
on
the
other
side
of
the
issue
and
point
out
why
those
arguments
where
wrong
instead
of
just
saying
why
their
own
side
was
correct.
Again
some
students
were
back
in
research
paper
mode,
simply
comparing
and
contrasting
facts
instead
of
pointing
out
fallacies
in
the
opponentOs
arguments.
I
worked
with
the
students
to
help
find
effective
ways
to
attack
the
arguments
of
opponents.
I
thought
this
was
an
interesting
strategy
to
employ
in
some
of
my
own
research
papers.
Instead
of
just
saying
a
criticOs
argument
is
wrong
for
these
factual
reasons,
I
also
talked
about
how
the
argument
is
flawed
because
it
exhibits
certain
logical
fallacies.
I
think
this
helped
make
my
writing
better
as
I
was
able
to
improve
the
quality
and
scope
of
my
own
research
papers.
Being
involved
in
the
WA
staff
meetings
also
helped
me
better
myself
as
a
writer.
It
was
interesting
when
fellow
WAOs
would
share
stories
about
some
difficulties
they
encountered
in
their
conferences
such
as
working
with
students
who
were
not
exactly
the
most
motivated.
The
other
WAOs
came
up
with
unique
ways
to
try
to
reach
out
to
the
students
and
to
get
them
to
try
to
evaluate
their
own
work
rather
than
having
the
WA
talk
at
them
for
30
minutes.
I
was
able
to
pick
up
some
interesting
pointers
to
help
improve
my
own
WA
conferences.
As
I
became
more
close
to
my
fellow
WAOs
via
the
staff
meetings
and
sharing
the
WA
room
for
conferences,
I
was
able
to
get
some
advice
to
better
my
own
writing.
If
I
had
trouble
writing
a
conclusion,
I
could
show
someone
my
paper
and
see
if
they
could
give
me
a
few
quick
pointers.
I
could
talk
in
more
general
terms
about
an
assignment
with
someone
who
previously
had
the
same
class
or
the
same
professor.
I
would
ask
fellow
WAOs
what
they
think
are
keys
to
writing
a
complete
paper
and
try
to
look
over
my
own
work
with
those
pointers
in
mind.
While
meeting
with
my
partner
professors,
I
was
also
able
to
pick
up
helpful
pointers
that
aided
in
my
growth
as
a
writer
over
the
past
year.
I
would
ask
the
professors
questions
about
the
specific
assignments
but
I
would
also
ask
for
some
of
their
opinions
on
writing
in
general.
I
would
ask
questions
like
NWhat
do
you
think
are
the
most
important
aspects
of
a
paper?O,
NWhat
are
some
key
mistakes
you
notice
often?O
or
NWhat
areas
do
you
anticipate
will
be
most
difficult
for
the
students?O
As
I
had
more
and
more
of
these
conversations,
I
began
to
develop
a
better
understanding
of
what
professors
were
looking
for
in
assignments.
While
not
all
professors
look
for
the
same
things,
I
was
able
to
better
evaluate
my
own
work
based
on
some
common
responses
I
received
from
various
professors.
I
also
was
able
to
develop
good
communication
skills,
so
that
I
could
try
to
receive
similar
information
about
assignments
from
professors
in
my
own
classes.
To
put
it
simply,
I
got
better
at
asking
questions.
I
was
able
to
delve
into
the
mind
of
professors
and
try
to
think
like
one
grading
my
assignment
while
I
was
writing
and
revising
it.
Being
a
WA
this
year
also
led
me
to
be
more
experimental,
and
a
bit
more
daring,
if
you
will,
with
my
writing.
Through
the
drop-in
service
I
was
exposed
to
many
interesting
topics,
styles,
and
writing
techniques.
One
piece
that
stood
out
for
me
was
the
chapter
I
read
of
a
studentOs
senior
thesis.
The
thesis,
which
was
about
Kenyan
literature,
was
very
interesting
to
me,
and
the
aspect
about
it
that
I
found
most
surprising
was
the
fact
that
it
contained
a
few
personal
anecdotes
to
help
support
some
of
the
writerOs
points.
I
always
thought
that
theses
were
strictly
research
papers
that
had
to
just
be
arguments
supported
by
factual
evidence
from
previous
research
or
research
conducted
by
the
student
writer.
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
see
a
thesis
that
was
not
so
cut
and
dry
and
actually
quite
personal.
I
began
to
realize
that
even
through
something
as
formal
as
a
research
paper,
the
individual
personal
writer
does
not
have
to
be
eliminated.
In
this
thesis,
the
student
definitely
kept
his
unique
voice,
story,
and
personality
woven
throughout
the
paper,
which
was
really
refreshing
for
me
to
see.
I
remember
all
throughout
grade
school
being
told
to
never
use
NIO
in
a
formal
research
paper.
I
thought
that
rule,
while
maybe
not
absolute,
was
almost
a
standard.
It
was
pleasing
to
see
that
that
this
is
not
always
the
case.
I
was
glad
to
find
that
I
have
more
freedom
in
formal
academic
writing
than
I
had
originally
thought.
My
time
as
a
WA
last
year
has
also
helped
me
improve
in
another
extracurricular
activity:
my
role
as
an
editor
of
the
student
newspaper.
Many
of
the
tips
I
picked
up
in
WA
conferences,
such
as
asking
a
lot
of
questions
and
focusing
on
higher
order
concerns,
has
helped
me
work
better
with
the
writers
in
my
section.
In
my
time
as
a
WA
I
became
more
comfortable
talking
and
relating
to
other
students.
I
found
more
and
more
ways
to
get
a
student
to
talk
about
a
piece
of
writing
even
if
he
or
she
was
hesitant
at
first.
I
found
some
of
the
same
methods
I
applied
in
conferences
where
effective
when
editing
newspaper
articles.
I
could
ask
the
students,
or
ask
myself
when
I
was
reading
the
article,
the
common
questions
I
used
in
a
WA
conference,
such
as
NWhat
is
the
purpose
or
goal
of
this
paper?O
or
NWhat
are
the
paperOs
strengths
and
weaknesses?O
These
key
questions
would
help
me
as
I
evaluated
the
article
to
see
ways
in
which
it
could
be
improved.
The
questions
would
also
work
as
a
Njumping
offO
point
to
influence
the
writer
to
discuss
and
evaluate
his
or
her
own
article.
There
was
a
great
deal
of
carryover
in
terms
of
techniques
that
worked
in
both
WA
conferences
and
conferences
with
the
newspaper
writers
in
my
section.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
has
certainly
changed
my
writing,
influencing
it
for
the
better.
I
think
this
transformation
is
mostly
due
to
the
fact
that
I
became
so
immersed
in
writing
last
year.
Almost
every
day
I
was
reading
or
writing
papers,
whether
it
was
for
my
own
class,
for
conferences,
or
for
drop-in.
At
weekly
staff
meetings
we
read
and
discussed
helpful
articles
that
talked
about
the
writing
and
conferencing
processes.
We
talked
about
any
difficulties
we
encountered
in
writing,
editing,
or
conferencing,
and
discussed
how
we
overcame
those
issues.
I
found
myself
immersed
in
a
community
where
there
was
a
writing
discourse
all
around
me.
In
my
own
writing,
I
began
to
become
more
conscious
of
the
various
strategies
I
discussed
in
conferences
and
staff
meetings.
As
I
wrote
and
edited
my
own
papers,
I
began
to
think
like
a
WA
or
even
a
professor
in
order
to
try
to
make
my
work
fulfill
its
purpose
in
a
clear
and
concise
manner.
