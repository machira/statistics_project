Some
Thoughts
from
the
Land
of
WA
I
was
so
prepared
for
those
first
conferences--or
so
I
thought.
Schedules,
drafts,
handouts,
the
St.
Martin's
Handbook,
my
training
experiences,
my
positive
attitude,
and
my
new-found
authority
as
a
writing
associate
were
all
with
me
the
first
time
I
sat
down
with
students.
But
it
is
not
until
after
the
first
conferences
are
over
that
a
writing
associate
can
really
get
his
or
her
priorities
in
order.
As
the
last
year
progressed,
each
conference
was
a
stepping
stone,
and
my
reflection
on
each
conference
was
the
jump
that
brought
me
from
stone
to
stone.
I
enjoyed
writing
my
literacy
narrative
last
year
because
it
forced
me
to
choose
defining
moments
in
my
history
as
a
writer.
My
experiences
as
a
first-year
student
included
successfully
completed
assignments
and
also
a
few
stumbles
on
the
way
to
WA-dom.
My
sophomore
year
brought
a
radically
different
perspective
to
my
view
of
writing
because
I
was
no
longer
standing
entirely
within
the
circle
of
my
work.
As
a
writing
associate,
I
had
one
foot
in
my
writing
and
one
foot
outside
of
it-^or
something
like
that.
Once
a
writer
puts
on
the
WA
hat,
it
is
always
there,
whether
clearly
visible
or
not.
Picture
this:
a
tired
writing
associate
sits
down
to
crank
out
a
short
paper
on
pastoral
and
anti-pastoral
elements
in
Milton.
But
the
student
is
not
alone
in
his
room
because
a
little
WA-conscience
is
sitting
on
his
shoulder
saying,
Now
what
would
you
tell
a
student
who
did
that?
and
Is
that
the
most
logical
way
to
organize
the
passage?
and
Is
that
really
on-topic?
and
a
host
of
other
questions.
Although
I
valued
being
able
to
step
outside
of
my
own
writing
in
order
to
critique
it
semi-objectiveiy,
this
more
informed
perspective
meant
more
time.
I
knew
the
tricks.
I
was
getting
better
at
recognizing
times
I
was
not
specific
enough,
times
when
I
was
off-track,
times
when
the
organization
was
just
not
right,
and
times
when
I
was
not
confident
of
my
knowledge
of
the
material
and
it
showed.
An
experience
which
highlights
the
WA-conscience
is
having
a
writing
associate
after
one
has
already
been
one
himself
or
herself.
During
the
second
semester,
I
took
my
VAST
seminar,
one
component
of
which
involves,
of
course,
meeting
with
a
writing
associate.
I
was
excited
about
having
a
WA
again,
knowing
how
helpful
it
can
be*
I
looked
forward
to
having
that
resource,
feeling
as
though
I
would
be
particularly
receptive
to
her
suggestions
because
I
would
probably
be
able
to
relate
to
her
position.
But
when
I
wrote
and
revised
my
first
paper
in
preparation
for
my
first
conference,
I
knew
essentially
what
to
expect
in
many
instances.
In
short,
my
paper
was
pre-WAed
(how's
that
for
a
verb?)
by
my
WA-conscience,
which
was
actively
anticipating
what
my
real
WA
would
focus
on
during
the
conference.
In
my
writing
mind,
I
was
constantly
encountering
thoughts
like,
No--I
can't
put
that
there
because
she'll
she
point
right
to
an
organizational
problem,
or
I
can't
just
leave
it
like
that
because
I
know
she
will
ask
me
to
give
an
example
or
to
explain
my
point
further.
As
a
writing
associate,
I
was
tuned
into
the
WA-frequency
and
had
some
fundamental
understanding
of
how
another
WA
might
approach
my
paper.
Although
the
WA-having-a-WA
example
is
in
some
way
a
more
unusual
circumstance,
it
evidences
the
sort
of
constructive
dilemma
a
WA
is
placed
in
when
completing
his
or
her
own
academic
work.
Of
course,
I
could
never
recognize
every
problematic
issue
in
my
papers,
but
my
revision
process
was
certainly
more
expansive.
Even
if
I
needed
suggestions
or
advice
about
a
particular
problem,
I
was
more
likely
to
recognize
that
there
actually
was
a
problem
in
the
first
place.
Being
a
writing
associate
has
improved
my
ability
to
spot
my
own
weaknesses
in
addition
to
realizing
my
own
strengths.
A
weighted
and
organized
consideration
of
these
strengths
and
weaknesses
actually
started
with
the
literacy
narrative
I
composed
at
this
time
last
summer.
Never
before
had
I
pondered
exactly
what
experiences
has
shaped
my
views
about
writing.
Especially
valuable
was
learning
that
everyone
has
a
literacy
narrative
of
his
or
her
own.
In
fact,
discussion
of
previous
writing
experience
became
important
during
my
first
semester
as
a
writing
associate.
I
not
only
noted
the
problems
particular
students
had
with
their
writing
and
how
they
could
improve
(things
I
expected
to
do
from
the
outset),
but
I
also
spent
some
time
delving
into
why
some
students
had
some
of
the
difficulties
they
did.
Most
of
my
memorable
conferences
involved
some
dialogue
about
a
writer's
part
experiences.
I
remember
addressing
the
inadequacy
of
the
simple
5-point
essay
approach
with
one
student
in
a
first-year
seminar.
The
issues
in
his
paper
were
far
too
complex
for
the
sort
of
neat
categorization
of
this
common
high-school
approach,
and
we
talked
about
how
he
could
break
up
his
huge
paragraphs
into
more
coherent,
logically
sequenced
points.
What
followed
was
a
dialogue
about
how
he
had
always
been
successful
using
the
five-point
approach
in
his
high
school
classes
and
how
he
assumed
that
such
a
structure
was
also
what
would
be
expected
in
college.
After
a
few
sets
of
conferences,
I
put
some
more
thought
into
a
writer's
past
experience
as
the
root
of
a
problem
that
student
may
be
having
or
at
least
as
the
root
a
writer's
attitude^
Making
these
connections
added
a
distinct
feel
to
my
conferences;
a
careful
contemplation
of
the
goals
of
a
literacy
narrative
assignment
has
a
surprising
value
most
new
writing
associates
do
not
expect.
Of
course,
my
own
literacy
narrative
grew
with
each
of
my
own
writing
experiences
this
year.
During
the
interim
session,
for
example,
I
took
an
anthropology
and
sociology
class
in
Ireland,
my
grade
in
which
would
be
determined
by
one
piece
of
writing--an
all-encompassing
journal
of
the
three-week
experience.
The
assignment
challenged
me
to
incorporate
large
amounts
of
factual
information,
a
mindful
reflection
on
the
issues
we
discussed
as
a
class,
and
a
personal
(and
usually
more
informal
account)
of
what
I
did
today.
Bumping
along
on
a
bus
across
the
Irish
countryside,
I
felt
like
I
was
torn
between
writing
an
objective,
no-frills
summary
of
the
notes
I
took
at
every
tour
and
lecture
and
a
completely
personal
conglomeration
of
stray
thoughts,
experiences
of
literary
imagination,
and
other
fond
musings.
Meshing
different
levels
of
writing
together
was
a
new
challenge,
as
was
the
lack
of
a
computer
and
time
alone.
I
was
also
torn
between
creating
a
polished
piece
of
writing
and
a
rough-around-the-edges,
as
it
occurred
to
me
journal.
Although
I
typed
the
finished
product,
it
remained
relatively
the
way
I
left
each
entry
after
a
given
day,
although
the
handwritten
draft
was
still
the
usual
messy
mass
of
blue
ink
scribbled
in
my
own
shorthand.
After
the
academic
year
ended,
I
undertook
an
internship
which,
like
the
course
in
Ireland,
warped
the
seemingly
stone-set
sense
of
structured
academic
writing.
Working
in
the
Annual
Fund
Office
in
Markle
Hall
here
at
Lafayette,
I
was
awakened
to
the
world
of
letter-writing
and
the
creation
of
promotional
information.
My
job
included
writing
a
variety
of
letters
to
alumni,
and
although
I
pored
over
each
word
in
an
attempt
to
create
a
well-developed,
complete
letter,
I
learned
how
to
write
with
a
brief
but
informed
sensibility.
In
classroom
writing,
we
are
rarely
told
not
to
expand
or
to
provide
important
details.
But
particularly
in
the
business
of
soliciting
money
from
alumni
of
the
College,
techniques
like
noting
differing
opinions
in
order
to
add
credibility
to
one's
own
cause
is
taboo.
In
short,
it
was
my
job
to
make
sure
that
letters,
for
example,
told
their
recipients
only
the
things
we
thought
that
they
needed
to
know
in
order
to
extract
a
desired
result
from
them.
Talk
about
a
real
agenda
for
my
writing!
As
I
approach
my
junior
year,
I
am
thinking
more
and
more
about
what
writing
will
be
like
after
I
leave
an
academic
environment.
And
with
each
assignment
I
complete,
whether
inside
or
outside
of
the
classroom
guidelines,
my
WA-conscience
is
ever-present.
I
feel
as
though
I
am
gaining
a
greater
understanding
of
what
it
means
to
be
critical,
especially
because
my
writing
is
being
viewed
through
more
and
more
lenses.
