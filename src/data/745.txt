My
Writing
Experience
When
I
was
in
second
grade,
I
was
daunted
when
my
teacher
asked
our
class
to
write
an
essay
about
whales.
Naturally,
as
a
seven
year
old,
the
idea
of
writing
a
paper
was
overwhelming
and
I
had
no
idea
where
to
begin
so
I
asked
my
mom
for
assistance.
While
I
cannot
really
remember
the
details
of
what
I
wrote,
I
know
that
my
mom
gave
a
large
contribution
to
the
sentences
and
word
selection.
A
few
weeks
later
she
told
me
that
my
teacher
had
talked
to
the
group
of
parents
at
parent-teacher
conferences
about
her
expectations
for
our
papers.
She
explained
that
she
could
tell
that
the
parents
were
writing
the
essays,
which
was
taking
away
from
the
writing
process
and
learning
experience
from
the
students.
When
my
mom
told
me
this,
I
was
determined
to
redeem
myself.
So
when
my
teacher
assigned
an
essay
on
hummingbirds
a
couple
weeks
later,
I
ran
off
the
school
bus
and
plopped
myself
down
at
the
kitchen
table
and
began
scribbling
away
in
my
marble
notebook
to
write
the
entire
thing
myself.
I
was
so
proud
of
myself
when
I
finished
and
glowingly
handed
my
finished
product
over
to
my
parents.
I
eagerly
searched
their
faces
as
they
read,
and
IOll
never
forget
the
look
they
gave
me
when
they
almost
simultaneously
expressed
their
surprise
that
I
really
didnOt
need
their
help
after
all.
A
couple
days
later
my
teacher
read
my
paper
to
the
class
and
said,
NSee
everyone.
This
is
what
I
was
looking
for!O
I
was
beaming.
From
that
moment
on
I
promised
to
myself
that
I
would
always
do
my
own
writing
and
to
never
again
sell
myself
short.
Ever
since
the
hummingbird
essay,
IOve
made
an
effort
to
show
off
my
work
to
anyone
willing
to
read
it.
I
always
showed
my
work
to
my
dad
and
would
eyeball
the
back
of
his
head
until
he
finished
reading.
I
desperately
craved
his
approval
of
my
writing
which
I
almost
always
received.
I
seemed
to
be
my
own
worst
critic.
Sometimes
I
would
even
question
over
and
over
again
if
I
answered
the
prompt
completely,
and
would
repeatedly
ask
my
dad
if
he
was
sure
that
it
was
alright.
But
as
I
became
older
and
my
writing
style
developed,
my
dad
continued
to
show
increased
interest
in
my
skillNhe
became
my
biggest
writing
fan.
I
valued
his
opinion
very
highly
and
was
confident
in
his
ability
to
determine
quality.
He
was
always
kind,
but
I
learned
that
if
he
said,
NItOs
fine,
yea
itOs
goodO
meant
it
could
use
some
work
and
if
he
said,
NitOs
very
goodO
meant
that
it
was
ready
to
be
turned
in.
Throughout
my
K-12
education
I
have
been
exposed
to
numerous
forms
of
writing
guidelines.
In
elementary
school
I
learned
how
to
write
simple
essays
and
basic
sentence
structure.
When
I
was
in
middle
school
they
began
to
teach
us
the
five
paragraph
persuasive
essay
for
standardized
testingNwhich
proved
to
be
useless
and
not
applicable
to
high
school
and
college
writing.
And
then
in
high
school
we
learned
more
complex
styles
such
as
long
research
papers
and
creative
writing.
As
I
became
more
excited
by
the
different
varieties
in
assignments
as
opposed
to
only
five
paragraph
persuasive
essays,
I
started
to
want
to
share
my
writing
with
my
close
friends.
In
my
sophomore
year
of
high
school
I
had
a
teacher
who
was
notoriously
a
tough
grader.
While
he
was
a
pleasure
in
class
and
had
a
fantastic
sense
of
humor,
all
freshmen
were
warned
of
his
strict
expectations.
For
our
first
writing
prompt
he
asked
us
to
elaborate
on
a
truly
happy
moment
in
a
descriptive
writing
piece.
And
this
baffled
meNI
had
never
written
anything
like
that
before.
The
extent
to
which
IOd
done
anything
similar
in
the
past
was
a
short
descriptive
poem
or
a
descriptive
paragraph.
Most
of
my
longer
pieces
of
writing
were
factual
and
the
idea
of
writing
about
whatever
I
wanted,
however
I
wanted
to
say
it,
for
ten
pages
was
a
little
intimidatingNespecially
with
my
teacherOs
reputation
looming
over
me.
I
had
a
very
difficult
time
even
picking
out
which
moment
I
wanted
to
capture
since
most
of
the
memories
I
might
have
chosen
were
too
personal
and
I
didnOt
feel
comfortable
sharing.
Instead
I
settled
for
talking
about
the
night
that
my
uncle
took
us
to
the
race
tracks.
It
was
a
safe
choice.
It
was
not
too
personal
and
I
figured
that
I
could
manipulate
it
into
being
a
more
interesting
story
than
I
remembered.
But
I
knew
when
I
handed
it
in
that
it
wasnOt
my
best
work.
When
I
got
it
back,
I
was
disheartened
when
I
saw
a
B-
at
the
bottom
of
my
paper.
And
then
I
realizedNwhatOs
wrong
with
talking
about
something
personal?
In
fact,
it
adds
a
whole
new
level
of
power
to
the
piece.
So
for
our
next
assignment,
a
story
dripping
with
sensory
details,
I
figured
I
might
as
well
try
getting
a
little
personal.
And
I
surprised
myself,
which
is
one
of
the
things
that
I
love
most
about
writing.
I
chose
to
write
about
the
last
time
I
ever
saw
my
grandma,
but
elaborated
to
make
it
more
dramatic.
As
I
typed,
all
of
my
words
fell
into
place
and
I
even
stirred
emotions
inside
myself.
This
time
when
I
handed
it
in,
I
felt
confident
and
I
never
looked
back.
In
junior
year
we
were
asked
to
write
a
historical
poem,
and
I
chose
to
talk
about
the
HolocaustNa
topic
very
personal
to
me.
I
chose
to
write
from
the
viewpoint
of
a
young
Jewish
woman
in
a
concentration
camp.
We
all
had
to
read
ours
out
loud
in
class,
and
as
I
started
to
read,
I
felt
myself
start
to
choke
up.
I
had
not
planned
on
it,
but
the
emotion
of
the
words
combined
with
the
act
of
reading
them
aloud
was
very
powerful.
But
I
could
see
on
my
classmateOs
faces
that
my
words
werenOt
only
affecting
me,
they
were
affecting
everyone
around
me,
which
I
loved.
It
was
at
this
moment
that
I
was
truly
able
to
appreciate
what
a
remarkable
tool
writing
is.
I
never
wrote
according
to
the
guidelines
my
teachers
expected.
I
was
never
inspired
by
outlines
or
brainstorming.
Instead
the
best
way
for
me
to
start
a
piece
of
writing
is
to
open
a
blank
Word
document
and
type
out
my
first
sentence.
After
that
first
sentence,
everything
else
seems
to
fall
into
place.
I
have
always
had
an
affinity
for
just
typing
away
at
my
computer,
editing,
copying
and
pasting,
and
typing
some
more
until
I
decided
my
paper
was
complete.
I
always
hated
in-class
essays
when
you
had
to
write
everything
all
at
once
in
a
one
hour
span.
I
think
IOm
at
my
best
when
I
can
just
sit
at
my
computer
and
re-read
and
move
around
sentences.
One
of
my
teachers
assigned
an
in-class
essay
and
then
told
us
that
we
had
to
type
up
what
we
wrote
in
class
and
add
the
conclusion
at
home
without
changing
the
portion
we
had
written
in
class.
For
me,
this
was
a
very
difficult
thing
for
me
to
accept
because
I
knew
that
my
in-class
writing
was
not
the
quality
that
I
set
the
bar
for
myself.
So
I
tried
to
tweak
it
a
little
bit
and
wrote
a
note
at
the
top
of
the
paper
apologizing
to
my
teacher
for
changing
it
around.
When
he
handed
it
back
I
was
delighted
to
see
that
he
gave
me
an
NAO
and
laughed
when
I
saw
his
additional
note,
NThis
is
better
than
what
you
wrote
in
class.
I
didnOt
realize
the
setting
could
make
such
a
difference!O
In
my
senior
year
of
high
school
I
was
challenged
when
my
English
teacher
decided
to
focus
on
creative
writing
for
half
of
the
school
year.
While
IOve
always
loved
to
write,
I
had
great
difficulty
creating
something
that
was
complete
fiction.
I
always
found
myself
returning
back
to
things
that
I
had
experienced.
I
envied
my
friends
who
could
make
up
a
story
out
of
thin
air.
But
then
I
came
to
college
and
my
experience
with
writing
completely
changed.
When
I
came
to
college
I
was
nervous
about
what
my
teachers
were
going
to
expect
of
me,
but
I
was
fairly
confident
that
my
high
school
teachers
had
taught
me
well.
I
took
a
wonderful
FYS
with
a
professor
who
truly
inspired
me.
All
that
we
had
to
write
for
the
course
was
two,
ten
page
research
papers,
and
we
were
free
to
choose
any
topic
that
was
related
to
the
course.
But
my
professor
wanted
me
to
write
about
a
topic
that
didnOt
particularly
interest
me,
which
made
it
a
lot
harder
for
me
to
construct
a
thought-provoking
essay.
I
constructed
a
first
draft
that
I
knew
needed
a
lot
of
improvement,
and
met
with
my
WA.
As
he
went
through
it
with
me
I
was
able
to
target
the
areas
that
I
really
needed
to
work
on.
I
sat
myself
in
the
library
for
an
entire
day,
and
with
very
few
breaks
I
worked
until
I
felt
like
it
was
completeNmy
first
college
paper.
For
my
second
paper
I
explored
different
options
as
I
learned
that
our
topics
were
not
restricted
to
history.
My
professor
suggested
that
I
read
a
novel
that
he
was
writing
a
book
on,
and
I
knew
that
was
what
I
wanted
to
write
my
second
paper
on.
I
handed
my
completed
paper
in
on
the
last
day
of
classes
and
forgot
about
it
after
that.
But
a
few
months
later
my
professor
emailed
me
again
and
suggested
that
I
submit
it
to
a
national
conference.
Its
acceptance
into
the
symposium
gave
me
a
whole
new
level
of
confidence
in
my
writing
ability.
The
next
semester
I
took
a
history
course.
It
was
one
of
those
classes
that
never
seemed
like
work.
Every
week
we
had
to
do
a
large
amount
of
reading
and
we
were
expected
to
write
our
reactions
into
a
compiled
journal
that
we
were
to
hand
in
at
the
end
of
the
semester.
That
journal
almost
became
a
hobby
of
mine
for
that
semester,
and
it
became
my
pride
and
joy.
I
was
highly
fascinated
by
all
of
the
readings
and
surprised
myself
about
how
limitless
my
reactions
were
and
how
I
could
type
for
hours
without
running
out
of
things
to
say.
For
the
first
time
I
realized
how
I
could
convert
my
passions
into
good
writing.
After
that
course,
writing
took
a
therapeutic
turn
for
me,
and
my
true
passion
for
writing
emerged.
I
started
to
carry
a
journal
with
me
everywhere
so
whenever
I
came
across
something
beautiful
in
nature,
or
in
lifeNor
if
I
even
thought
of
a
well
constructed
sentence
in
my
headNI
started
to
learn
how
to
let
my
creativity
flow,
finally
overcoming
my
slump
in
high
school.
I
even
started
to
write
a
book,
and
my
progress
gave
me
the
courage
to
sign
up
for
creative
writing
this
fall.
With
the
encouragement
of
my
teachers,
parents,
and
friends,
I
have
truly
developed
a
love
for
writing.
As
an
RA
last
year
I
would
even
proofread
my
residentOs
essays
and
give
them
advice.
There
is
something
truly
incredible
about
how
you
can
take
a
couple
words
that
when
alone,
are
simple,
but
when
put
together
can
create
something
profound
and
meaningful.
There
are
infinite
possibilities
to
express
yourself
or
to
teach
someone
something
new.
I
am
very
excited
to
become
a
WA
not
only
to
help
share
my
passion
for
writing
with
my
fellow
students,
but
to
also
become
a
better
writer
myself.
