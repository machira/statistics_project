Fall
2008
It
smelled
like
freshly
cut
grass.
You
know,
that
clean
crisp
fragrance
of
new
beginnings
that
fills
the
yard
on
a
hot
summer
morning.
A
few
bluebirds
discussed
the
meaning
of
life
in
their
adorable
chirping
voices
atop
a
giant
oak
tree.
An
ice
cream
truck
rattled
by
singing
a
childish
tune,
and
I
closed
my
eyes
to
inhale
the
delicious
smell
of
summer
that
surrounded
me.
I
tried
to
clear
my
head.
Inhale,
1,2,3
exhale
1,2,3.
I
let
my
thoughts
of
ex-boyfriends,
dinner
plans,
work
schedules,
and
world
peace
fade
away
into
the
steamy
breeze.
rFocus
Erica!s
I
screamed
at
myself
silently
as
my
mind
started
to
drift
off
again.
I
felt
the
sun
burning
my
bare
shoulders,
leaving
a
sprinkling
of
little
freckles
as
a
gift
for
me.
I
watched
the
beads
of
condensation
trickle
down
the
side
of
my
hazelnut
iced
coffee
feeling
restless
and
confused.
Why
was
this
so
hard?
I
picked
up
the
white
paper
that
lay
before
me
re-reading
the
assignment
for
the
hundredth
time.
rDescribe
your
history
as
a
writeris
I
repeated
the
words
trying
to
figure
out
where
to
begini
I
have
always
considered
myself
to
be
a
creative
person.
I
have
discovered
that
using
words
as
my
instruments,
I
can
create
a
symphony
out
of
any
topics
using
my
imagination.
In
the
past
year,
my
writing
has
evolved
into
an
entirely
new
organism
because
of
the
new
approach
I
have
taken
towards
developing
it.
This
approach
requires
me
to
step
outside
of
the
realm
of
the
rnormals
writing
process
in
order
to
incorporate
my
own
stylistic
flair.
I
first
began
experimenting
with
new
writing
styles
in
a
class
I
took
last
semester
called
rwriting
genres,s
where
I
explored
a
variety
of
different
types
of
writing,
using
them
as
inspiration
in
creating
my
own
voice.
I
remember
feeling
anxious
when
we
received
our
first
assignment.
We
had
to
discuss
ourselves
as
academic
writers
and
how
we
felt
about
scientific
writing,
which
I
had
no
experience
with
as
an
English
major.
I
never
thought
of
science
as
something
related
to
English
because
I
had
never
explored
that
genre
of
writing.
After
reading
a
variety
of
texts
dealing
with
different
genres
of
writing
I
began
to
see
English
in
a
new
way.
Suddenly,
my
analytical
papers
for
my
seminar
centered
around
1920us
literature
began
to
come
to
life
with
more
than
just
analysis.
I
started
experimenting
with
repetition,
poetic
language,
and
metaphors
in
my
academic
papers,
pushing
the
envelope
as
much
as
I
thought
each
professor
would
allow.
My
experiences
in
the
writing
genres
class
helped
to
begin
forming
my
new,
more
creative
approach
to
writing.
Once
I
began
to
feel
comfortable
rejecting
the
conventional
r5
paragraph
essays
approach
to
writing,
I
began
to
develop
my
own
voice.
By
nature,
I
am
a
sarcastic
person,
and
I
began
to
see
twangs
of
sarcasm
in
my
writing.
I
remember
writing
a
research
paper
on
gene
therapy
and
its
potential
affects
on
society.
As
I
began
to
explore
both
sides
of
the
controversial
issue
in
my
paper,
I
found
myself
bullying
the
side
I
didnut
agree
with
using
a
sarcastic,
humorous
voice
and
supporting
the
side
I
felt
was
moral
with
a
more
powerful
and
passionate
voice.
Luckily,
the
assignment
required
us
to
explore
a
new
genre
of
writing
while
informing
the
audience
about
the
topic,
which
I
was
able
to
do
using
these
different
voices.
The
experiences
I
have
shared
with
the
student
writers
I
work
with
as
a
WA
play
a
crucial
role
in
my
writing
process
and
how
it
has
been
developing
and
changing
over
the
last
year.
Every
paper
I
read
comes
from
a
different
mind,
which
means
I
have
been
given
the
privilege
of
overseeing
a
variety
of
writing
styles
and
backgrounds.
I
remember
one
student
I
worked
with
was
an
art
major.
The
assignment
for
her
FYS
paper
was
to
write
about
a
significant
topic
in
German
culture
or
history
within
a
given
time
frame
and
she
chose
war
propaganda.
I
remember
reading
her
paper
and
being
amazed
at
how
she
incorporated
propaganda
images
into
the
paper
through
her
vivid
descriptions
and
tone
of
voice.
As
a
reader
you
could
see
the
images
she
described
because
of
how
closely
she
paid
attention
to
detail.
She
inspired
me
to
explore
a
more
artistic
approach
to
writing
and
the
English
language
in
general,
which
has
stuck
with
me
ever
since.
Although
my
experiences
as
a
WA
always
end
up
being
rewarding,
my
student
writers
questioned
me
just
as
much
as
I
was
praised.
All
of
the
students
I
have
worked
with
were
respectful
and
eager
to
hear
my
advice,
however
not
all
of
them
agreed
with
it,
which
was
a
challenge.
I
remember
working
with
one
student
in
particular,
who
was
very
smart
and
set
in
his
ways
as
a
writer.
I
tried
to
explain
to
him
that
although
he
knew
a
lot
about
the
topic
he
was
writing
about,
there
were
parts
of
his
paper
that
lacked
clarity
because
he
wasnut
keeping
his
audience
in
mind
while
writing.
He
insisted
that
this
unclear
approach
was
simply
rhis
style,s
when
in
actuality
he
didnut
really
have
a
unique
style,
and
I
had
to
remain
supportive
while
also
showing
this
weakness.
I
ended
up
asking
a
fellow
WA
for
advice
during
a
weekly
staff
meeting
because
I
felt
that
I
wasnut
helping
my
student
overcome
this
flaw
in
his
writing.
My
friend
has
been
a
WA
for
2
years
so
I
knew
she
would
have
more
experience
with
challenging
students
than
I
have
had.
She
ended
up
reading
his
paper
and
coming
up
with
some
great
advice
that
I
never
would
have
thought
of
for
my
student.
As
a
WA,
I
look
at
the
writing
process
as
a
collaborative
effort
rather
than
a
singular
chore.
From
attending
weekly
staff
meetings
and
working
with
students
one
on
one,
I
now
understand
how
important
it
is
to
get
another
writerus
opinion.
No
matter
how
great
I
think
a
paper
of
mine
is,
I
always
make
a
few
of
my
friends
read
it
to
get
their
feedback
and
personal
comments.
Lucky
for
me,
my
friends
are
WAus
also
but
with
different
academic
backgrounds,
which
has
been
really
beneficial
for
me
as
an
English
major.
Each
friend
is
able
to
give
me
advice
on
a
unique
area
that
they
specialize
in
and
I
am
able
to
look
at
my
paper
through
their
perspective,
which
I
never
would
have
been
capable
of
if
I
didnut
become
a
WA.
I
remember
my
first
conference
last
fall.
My
palms
were
sweaty
and
my
heart
was
pounding
in
anticipation.
I
was
petrified
of
being
awkward
or
overbearing
and
making
my
student
feel
uncomfortable.
I
am
usually
a
pretty
secure
person,
but
I
remember
feeling
totally
self-conscious
and
unsure
of
my
writing
abilities
as
my
first
student
walked
through
the
door
and
sat
down
with
me
to
go
over
her
rough
draft.
I
realized
right
away
that
she
was
more
nervous
than
I
was,
and
that
most
students
have
no
idea
what
to
expect
when
they
come
in
to
their
first
WA
meeting.
I
pretended
I
was
a
professional,
and
I
started
to
ask
her
questions
about
herself
and
her
writing
background,
which
opened
her
up
and
made
her
relax.
Suddenly,
I
felt
a
wave
of
confidence,
which
helped
guide
me
through
her
thesis
statement
all
the
way
to
her
conclusion.
I
began
to
see
myself
as
an
authority
on
the
writing
process,
using
what
I
had
learned
in
my
staff
meetings
as
a
tool
to
help
teach
my
students.
The
confidence
I
have
in
my
writing
today
has
been
created
and
shaped
by
my
experiences
with
the
students
I
work
with
as
a
WA.
As
the
new
academic
term
approaches,
I
am
extremely
excited
to
see
where
my
writing
will
take
me.
This
semester
I
am
taking
two
English
classes
called
Modern
British
Literature
and
Creative
Writing.
I
would
imagine
that
the
British
Lit.
class
will
be
similar
to
other
300-level
English
seminars
I
have
taken
in
the
past,
however
I
am
eager
to
study
the
British
genre
of
writing
to
see
how
it
will
influence
me.
I
have
rather
high
expectations
for
my
creative
writing
class,
as
I
know
I
will
be
exploring
new
ways
of
thinking
and
looking
at
literature.
My
writing
has
evolved
incredibly
in
the
past
year,
and
I
canut
imagine
where
this
next
semester
will
take
it.
I
hope
to
focus
on
poetry
more
closely
this
semester
in
my
creative
writing
class
so
that
I
can
add
it
to
my
palate
of
literary
devices.
I
also
look
forward
to
being
assigned
to
a
new
class
of
freshman
students,
getting
to
know
them,
and
their
unique
perspectives
on
writing.
My
spring
semester
of
last
year
was
spent
in
Madrid,
Spain
studying
abroad,
which
had
a
huge
affect
on
my
writing.
The
program
I
chose
to
work
with
placed
each
student
in
a
Spanish
host
family,
most
of
which
spoke
little
or
no
English.
I
lived
with
a
lovely
woman
named
Loli
who
only
spoke
Spanish
and
since
I
havenut
taken
Spanish
since
high
school,
this
proved
to
be
a
difficult
situation
at
first.
Every
time
I
needed
to
communicate,
whether
it
was
to
ask
where
the
bathroom
was
or
to
pass
the
salt
at
dinner,
I
had
to
think
about
sentence
structure,
verb
tenses,
and
vocabulary.
This
was
a
new
phenomenon
for
me
that
made
me
think
twice
about
my
writing.
I
was
taking
an
English
class
at
the
time
called
Hemingway
in
Spain,
and
when
we
were
asked
to
write
a
paper
on
one
of
the
texts
I
found
myself
analyzing
my
sentence
structure
and
vocabulary
more
so
than
the
content.
Although
I
have
always
paid
attention
to
these
things,
I
began
to
obsess
about
them
while
I
was
in
Spain,
to
the
point
where
my
writing
lacked
emotion
because
of
the
technicalities
I
chose
to
focus
my
attention
on.
Once
I
noticed
this
problem
I
made
a
conscious
effort
to
concentrate
on
grammar
and
content
equally,
and
I
think
my
writing
has
grown
stronger
because
of
it.
While
I
was
in
Spain
I
felt
myself
maturing
and
evolving,
which
naturally
had
an
effect
on
my
confidence.
One
seems
to
learn
a
lot
about
themselves
when
they
are
immersed
into
an
unfamiliar
culture,
surrounded
by
the
unknown.
Spain
follows
a
more
laid
back
pace
in
regard
to
everyday
life
and
the
people
seem
to
enjoy
every
minute
of
it.
In
the
Hemingway
class
I
took,
we
read
a
variety
of
his
texts,
including
short
stories
and
novels,
in
order
to
examine
his
unique
style
and
approach
at
writing.
I
became
a
true
fan
of
Hemingwayus
post-modernist
work
and
he
has
undoubtedly
influenced
my
own
style.
I
see
his
inspiration
in
almost
everything
I
write,
including
this
paper.
I
chose
to
frame
this
assignment
with
nature
in
the
beginning,
as
a
pathway
into
my
inner
thoughts,
which
were
two
elements
of
Hemingwayus
post-modern
endeavor.
Although
it
was
unfortunate
that
I
couldnut
work
as
a
WA
with
a
class
of
student
writers
last
semester,
I
am
extraordinarily
grateful
that
I
was
able
to
explore
the
Spanish
culture,
allowing
it
to
inspire
my
writing
and
me.
As
the
fall
semester
approaches,
I
am
eager
to
start
classes
and
begin
working
as
a
WA
for
a
new
group
of
students.
Although
I
have
only
been
a
WA
for
one
semester,
I
feel
that
my
experiences
could
help
a
new
WA
who
is
anxious
and
unsure
of
their
ability.
My
advice
would
be
to
remain
confident,
no
matter
how
self-conscious
you
are
in
the
beginning.
Students
seem
to
feed
off
of
confidence,
as
I
have
noticed
in
my
WA
meetings,
so
as
long
as
you
remain
the
authority
figure,
a
student
will
always
look
up
to
you
and
value
your
advice.
I
would
also
advise
any
new
WA
to
ask
for
help
whenever
it
is
needed
and
to
be
open-minded.
Teach
the
student
and
allow
them
to
teach
you.
