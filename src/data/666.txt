Chris
WA
summer
narrative
It
is
certainly
a
daunting
to
task
try
to
put
in
perspective
my
year
as
a
writer.
This
is
not
necessarily
because
it
is
a
convoluted
tale,
but
rather
because
the
summer
sun
shines
through
my
window
and
implores
me
to
take
advantage
of
its
benevolence
or
the
man
beckons
me
to
fill
his
supermarket
shelves
for
minimum
wage.
Regardless,
a
deadline
is
fast
approaching
and
itus
time
to
dust
out
the
cobwebs
and
re-channel
all
that
Iuve
learned
and
all
Iuve
parted
ways
with
as
a
writer
in
the
past
year.
I
must
say
it
really
has
been
a
pivotal
year
in
regards
to
my
writing.
For
one,
I
became
a
writing
associate.
In
fact
it
was
nearly
a
year
ago
to
this
day
on
which
I
begin
to
write
this
narrative
that
I
got
a
call
informing
me
that
I
was
to
be
moved
up
from
the
murky
depths
of
the
WA
reserve
pool
to
the
big
show.
Naturally
I
was
elated,
and
for
many
reasons.
There
was
the
paycheck,
the
ability
to
partner
with
professors,
the
prestige
of
the
position
on
campus,
and
the
opportunity
to
help
fellow
students
get
better
at
an
essential
skill.
But
most
important
to
me
was
the
opportunity
I
saw
to
hone
and
develop
my
own
writing
skills,
something
I
valued
very
much
as
I
knew
such
opportunities
are
limited
to
Bachelors
of
Science
candidates
such
as
myself;
a
biochemistry
major.
I
think
this
is
a
good
time
to
segway
into
the
other
monumental
thing
that
happened
to
me
this
year
as
a
writer:
I
became
an
English
major.
My
apologies
for
disclosing
the
plot
twists
so
early,
but
without
further
ado
I
present
to
you
a
year
in
the
life
of
Chris
Murphy:
the
writer.
Writing
had
always
meant
something
different
to
me
before
this
year.
Let
me
try
to
explain
to
you
what
I
mean
by
this.
Beneath
the
college
level
I
found
expectations
for
writing
to
be
not
necessarily
lower,
but
markedly
different.
I
was
an
AP
student
and
considered
myself
among
the
top
writers
in
my
high
school.
Whether
it
was
a
research
paper,
speech
or
narrative
I
could
write
it,
and
usually
well.
My
formula,
as
was
that
of
both
my
equally
and
superiorly
talented
peers,
was
to
think
of
something
clever,
not
altogether
unique
but
something
that
could
be
delivered
eloquently.
We
would
then
proceed
to
extract
the
piece
from
a
handful
of
these
rprofounds
thoughts.
It
worked
and
we
all
built
up
the
illusion
in
our
minds
that
we
were
good
writers.
Talented
in
the
manipulation
of
words
maybe,
but
being
a
good
writer
is
something
different
entirely.
The
last
minute
phone
call
I
received
last
summer
was
the
beginning
of
this
revelation,
placing
me
in
a
program
that
would
be
the
Yoda
to
my
Luke
Skywalker
if
you
will.
Before
becoming
a
writing
associate
I
would
never
have
been
able
to
tell
you
what
it
meant
to
rhave
an
intelligent
discourse
one
writing;s
let
alone
actually
have
one.
Yet
this
was
what
was
to
be
expected
of
writing
associates,
both
new
and
old
throughout
the
academic
year;
first
between
each
other
in
workshops
and
staff
meetings
then
with
students.
What
happened
to
simply
proof
reading
for
grammar?
Admittedly,
that
was
what
I
usually
had
done
for
friends
who
asked
for
my
input
on
their
papers.
(Iull
pause
here
for
the
gasp
sure
to
come
from
the
experienced
WA)
Indeed,
to
truly
help
a
student
learn
how
to
write
the
writing
associate
cannot
undermine
the
intricacy
of
the
writing
process
by
simply
fixing
commas
and
spelling
and
things
of
that
manner.
If
a
math
tutor
were
to
work
through
a
studentus
homework
assignment
and
fix
answers
without
explaining
the
process
to
get
to
them
would
the
student
really
learn
anything?
Hereus
what
this
rlearning
processs
would
look
like:
Student:
(disgruntled)
rSure,
okay
it
would
take
40
seconds
for
train
A
and
train
B
to
collide
here.s
(continuing,
pointing
forcefully
at
the
problem
in
the
textbook)
rBut
what
if
train
A
were
traveling
10
kilometers
per
hour
faster?
And
what
if
train
Bus
rate
of
deceleration
was
2
kilometers
per
hour
slower?
(losing
breath)
And
what
if
there
was
a
stiff
wind
of
30
kilometers
per
hour
at
the
tail
of
train
A?
(anguished)
There
are
innocent
lives
at
stake
here!
What
do
you
suggest
I
do
Mr./Ms.
tutor?s
Tutor:
(perplexed)
Uhhhii
End
Scene
By
now
you
get
the
point,
of
course
the
answer
is
no;
the
student
could
not
be
sufficiently
educated
by
simply
having
his
or
her
answers
changed
to
the
correct
ones.
Putting
this
in
the
context
of
our
job,
we
as
writing
associates
are
responsible
for
educating
students
on
the
process
of
writing
and
driving
them
towards
sound
writing
techniques.
This
notion
was
a
logical
one
for
me,
but
one
I
had
not
spent
much
time
deliberating
in
my
head
unprovoked.
Talking
about
writing
on
an
elevated
level
was
in
a
word
rdistants
for
me,
but
without
a
doubt
that
vital
step
towards
becoming
a
respectable
writer.
So
what
were
the
things
I
should
have
spent
time
developing
in
papers
past
rather
than
those
grandiose
statements
that
typified
my
once
heavily
relied
on
formula?
The
concept
that
stuck
out
to
me
most
was
idea
of
the
raudiences
of
a
piece.
Who
is
meant
to
receive
the
work?
What
should
be
accomplished
by
the
writing?
I
was
introduced
to
this
topic
by
that
infamous
debate
that
was
captivated
students
and
professors
alike
involved
with
the
Lafayette
College
Writing
program:
Which
is
better;
Paper
A
or
Paper
B?
The
superficial
answer
is
that
both
are
horrible.
Neither
get
a
passing
grade.
The
students
and
instructors
involved
in
both
pieces
take
from
the
assignment
feelings
of
unprecedented
shame.
But
obviously
if
you
had
to
pick
one
it
would
be
A;
right?
Paper
B
makes
a
mockery
of
the
English
language,
using
crude
language
to
orchestrate
a
primitive
response.
The
writer
of
paper
A
at
least
tries.
He/she
may
be
a
bit
off
topic
but
the
diction
is
at
least
above
that
of
a
five
year
old.
Hereus
the
twist
though:
paper
B
is
the
better
piece.
Perhaps
you
are
wondering
why?
While
paper
A
fights
admirably
to
present
ideas
eloquently,
in
doing
so
it
meanders
around
the
questions
the
prompt
raises,
thereby
making
a
mockery
of
the
prompt.
In
the
academic
world,
making
a
mockery
of
a
prompt
is
certainly
the
greater
sin
than
making
a
mockery
of
the
English
language.
I
know,
a
bold
statement,
but
somebody
had
to
say
it.
Therefore,
the
writer
behind
paper
B
wins
in
this
battle
of
underachievers
for
at
least
staying
honest
to
what
the
instructor
assigned.
This
example
really
underscores
how
important
it
is
for
students
to
get
it
right
from
the
beginning
of
the
writing
process;
that
is
with
the
prompt.
For
each
round
of
conferences,
I
have
gotten
into
the
habit
of
marking
up
the
prompt
more
than
any
one
studentus
paper.
We
talk
about
the
prompt
for
a
good
portion
of
the
conference.
I
meet
beforehand
with
the
partner
professor
to
ensure
I
know
precisely
his
or
her
expectations
then
ask
the
students
what
their
own
impression
of
the
prompt
was
and
construct
the
meeting
based
on
how
well
they
have
targeted
the
intended
audience.
In
the
past
year
I
have
encountered
prompts
that
have
asked
students
to
write
towards
audiences
ranging
from
professional
anglers
to
Ancient
Roman
scholars.
With
each
prompt
I
sense
myself
becoming
more
adept
at
looking
at
a
prompt
and
envisioning
what
an
appropriate
response
would
look
like,
even
if
I
am
not
completely
verse
on
the
subject
matter.
I
came
into
the
writing
program
expecting
to
be
utilized
strictly
in
science
courses;
and
one
partner
professor
I
had
was
more
than
unsettled
to
find
out
I
was
a
science
major
impersonating
a
writing
tutor
for
his
literature
based
course.
Maybe
a
year
ago
his
point
would
be
fair,
but
with
training
the
writing
program
has
taken
me
to
the
next
step
as
a
writer
to
where
I
can
discuss
any
type
of
writing.
Now
this
was
all
well
and
good.
I
was
learning
and
appreciating
a
new
found
pedagogical
approach
to
writing
and
sharing
it
with
my
own
students
to
elevate
their
own
standards
for
writing.
However,
I
must
admit
during
the
fall
semester
of
2009
I
wasnut
exactly
rpracticing
what
I
preached.s
The
main
reason
for
this
was
a
lack
of
time.
As
a
Bachelors
of
Science
major,
my
curriculum
was
loaded
with
consuming
courses.
On
top
of
the
English
class
I
was
taking
to
work
towards
my
minor
in
the
discipline,
I
was
enrolled
in
Calculus
III,
Organic
Chemistry
and
Thermodynamics
and
Waves,
a
calculus
based
physics
course.
The
workload
was
a
tremendous
burden
and
I
found
myself
giving
less
and
less
time
to
my
English
studies
There
was
no
time
to
develop
papers
and
I
wrote
all
of
them
while
pulling
all-nighters.
As
result
was
that
I
was
forced
to
follow
my
old
formula.
The
irony
of
this
was
that
in
reality
it
was
a,
though
familiar,
ultimately
inefficient
system.
Trying
to
piece
together
disjointed
ideas
that
I
doggedly
adhered
to
because
I
thought
they
sounded
good
could
never
be
as
easy
as
going
about
writing
the
paper
in
a
calculated
manner.
Either
way,
it
was
clear
to
me
that
I
was
not
giving
my
writing
its
full
due
and
that
was
certainly
heartbreaking
as
it
had
always
been
a
real
passion
of
mine.
So
in
the
spring
of
last
year
I
decided
to
become
an
English
major,
while
still
pursuing
a
Bachelor
of
Arts
degree
in
Biochemistry
rather
than
the
stricter
Bachelor
of
Science
path.
With
the
change
I
found
myself
able
to
be
truly
thorough
in
the
reading
and
writing
process
for
the
first
time
as
a
college
student.
What
I
learned
in
staff
meetings
each
week
could
finally
come
full
circle
and
be
applied
not
only
to
my
students
but
also
to
my
own
writing.
The
change
brought
about
new
challenges
for
me
as
a
writer.
I
was
asked
to
write
poetry,
creative
fiction,
and
journalism
all
for
the
first
time.
Tackling
new
genres
was
never
easy,
but
the
trust
the
program
had
in
me
by
putting
20
students
under
my
tutelage
each
semester
had
done
wonders
for
my
confidence
as
a
writer.
With
the
writing
program
by
my
side
I
am
sure
that
I
will
continue
to
grow
as
a
writer
and
I
am
looking
forward
to
the
new
academic
year
for
this
very
reason.
