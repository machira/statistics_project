The
Year
in
Review
Miranda.
When
I
first
saw
the
subject
of
this
assignment,
I
thought
to
myself,
What
am
I
going
to
write
about?
I've
hardly
written
during
the
past
semester,
having
gone
abroad
in
the
spring.
But
the
more
I
thought
about
it,
the
more
I
realized
how
many
important
experiences
were
occurring
even
though
I
didn't
think
of
them
as
such
then.
Even
though
in
the
past
year
I've
written
less
than
I
think
I
ever
have,
there
are
moments
that
are
worth
noting,
such
as
new
expectations
from
professors,
writing
in
a
foreign
language,
and
simply
being
a
W.A.
In
the
fall
semester
of
last
year,
I
had
one
English
course
in
particular
which
influenced
me.
In
this
class,
I
came
into
contact
with
writing
weekly
one
or
two
page
commentaries,
which
I
eventually
came
to
detest.
This
kind
of
writing
asked
me
to
take
a
piece
that
I
had
read
and
simply
comment
on
it,
interpreting
it
based
on
past
selections
and
what
was
being
discussed
in
class.
I
often
sat
down
at
the
computer
with
the
poem
or
work
in
front
of
me,
just
staring
at
a
blank
screen.
This
kind
of
writing
gave
me
the
most
trouble
I
have
ever
had.
One
reason
it
did
is
because
I
didn't
have
much
to
rely
on
or
take
from.
I
think
I
went
through
a
different
writing
process
for
these
assignments.
There
was
no
pre-writing
involved
and
the
normal
structure
I
relied
on
didn't
really
come
into
play.
The
introduction
paragraph
was
contracted
to
a
sentence
or
two,
and
the
conclusion
as
well.
I
took
it
less
seriously
and
felt
that
I
had
more
freedom
with
this
type
of
writing.
The
freedom
was
the
problem
however
because
the
subject
of
the
commentary
came
completely
from
me.
Sometimes,
I
didn't
have
anything
to
say
about
the
work,
and
in
those
moments
I
really
learned
to
dig
deep
to
write
intelligently
about
something
for
which
I
had
little
or
no
feeling.
Also
in
this
class,
we
were
required
to
write
one
single
paper
which
would
account
for
a
significant
amount
of
our
grade.
The
thought
of
this
paper
kept
me
up
at
night,
and
I
planned
how
I
was
going
to
create
this
perfect
(or
as
perfect
as
I
could
get
it)
paper.
I
started
well
in
advance,
went
through
pre-writing,
then
after
I
had
a
draft,
revised
and
wrote
again.
I
even
thought
about
going
to
a
friend
who
was
a
W.A.
for
her
to
check
it
out
one
last
time,
but
I
didn't.
I
spent
a
lot
of
effort
on
this
paper
and
did
so
because
I
was
unsure
of
the
professors'
expectations.
He
had
told
us
to
show
him
what
we
knew
which
was
different
from
what
I
was
used
to.
I
was
more
accustomed
to
show
me
what
you
think
about
this
play,
but
instead
I
was
asked
to
regurgitate
his
lessons
in
class.
This
didn't
sit
very
well
with
me,
since
I
wanted
to
think
more
on
my
own
instead
of
telling
him
what
he
already
knew.
So,
I
didn't
veer
too
far
from
my
normal
practice-I
incorporated
what
the
professor
talked
about
in
class
but
also
gave
it
a
twist
with
my
own
interpretation.
I
was
successful
in
that
he
liked
the
paper,
and
I
learned
something
important
from
it.
Even
though
my
audience
may
have
certain
expectations,
I
have
developed
a
certain
identity
to
my
writing
which
I
am
unwilling
to
give
up.
As
part
of
my
writing
identity,
structure
plays
a
major
role.
I
don't
know
what
I
would
do
in
writing
without
rules
and
a
form.
Some
of
the
students
I
have
worked
with
were
opposite
this
view;
for
them
the
structure
of
a
paper
really
seemed
to
hinder
the
thought
process
and
the
writing
of
a
paper.
But
for
me,
I'd
be
lost
without
it.
It's
necessary
for
me
to
have
this
plan
in
mind,
almost
like
a
blueprint
to
follow.
The
disadvantage
of
this
practice
is
that
sometimes
my
papers
tend
to
be
too
similar;
they
don't
have
enough
style
or
flair
or
originality.
I'd
like
to
work
on
getting
more
life
into
my
papers,
but
breaking
free
from
my
safe
form
I'm
used
to
is
daunting.
Sometimes
I
think
that
I
focus
too
much
on
it
and
that
I
should
really
work
to
change
it.
I've
noticed
that
in
some
of
my
papers,
the
structure
may
be
present
and
sound,
but
that
something
is
lacking
from
the
paper.
That
something
could
be
what
engages
you
to
read
it,
what
keeps
you
interested,
etc.,
and
it's
an
important
aspect
that
I
need
to
work
on.
That
is
one
characteristic
of
my
writing
identity.
Another
is
attention
to
detail
and
precision.
Writing
papers
has
always
been
a
tough
experience
every
time
I
go
through
it,
and
I
attribute
the
difficulty
to
this
aspect
of
my
identity.
I'm
very
meticulous
and
I
often
agonize
over
each
sentence
and
each
word,
asking
myself
if
this
is
really
what
I
want
to
say.
I
have
to
be
certain
that
everything
I
have
said
is
logical;
contradictions
or
problems
of
clarity
frustrate
me.
I
think
this
is
a
good
aspect
of
my
writing
identity,
even
though
it
may
be
the
most
exasperating.
I've
just
recently
realized
these
aspects
of
my
writing
identity,
but
there
were
other
experiences
during
the
year
which
were
even
more
formative
and
had
more
of
an
impact
on
how
I
write,
and
how
I
view
communication
through
writing.
Writing
in
a
foreign
language
was
actually
one
of
the
most
important
experiences
of
the
year
because
I
did
so
much
of
it.
Spending
four
and
a
half
months
in
France,
I
wrote
three
10
page
papers
along
with
numerous
other
shorter
writing
assignments.
When
I
wrote
in
French,
one
of
the
first
things
I
noticed
was
that
I
tended
to
repeat
myself
less.
Since
I
was
less
comfortable
with
the
language
than
English,
I
was
less
likely
to
clutter
the
paper
with
useless
phrases
and
pieces
of
information.
These
papers
tended
to
be
more
sparse
and
to
the
point
than
my
papers
written
in
English.
I
would
also
pay
even
more
attention
to
structure
because
it
was
one
thing
I
could
rely
on.
Even
though
the
language
was
changing,
the
form
of
my
paper
stayed
the
same.
It
was
like
going
back
to
basics
when
writing
in
French
and
I
found
myself
wanting
to
be
more
precise
and
making
my
point
the
first
time
around
instead
of
repeating
it
three
times.
One
aspect
that
fell
through
in
this
kind
of
writing
was
my
style.
I
felt
like
my
papers
had
no
flair,
no
originality.
This
stemmed
from
my
lack
of
vocabulary
in
the
language
and
it
made
writing
frustrating
because
I
was
used
to
careful
word
choice.
I
always
had
to
have
the
right
word"
in
a
sentence
and
in
French
I
often
could
not
do
that.
Overall
however,
the
experience
of
writing
in
a
foreign
language
has
first
of
all
made
me
feel
so
much
more
confident
about
writing
in
my
own
language,
and
also
that
once
the
words
are
taken
away
there
remains
a
form
that
is
constant
and
reliable.
The
third
most
important
experience
of
last
year
was
my
semester
as
a
writing
associate.
When
I
first
started,
I
can't
say
that
I
felt
all
that
assured
of
my
authority
to
help
the
students.
I
wondered,
what
if
I
can't
answer
their
questions,
or
what
if
1
don't
know
what
to
do
with
their
paper.
But
once
I
got
started,
I
realized
that
it
got
easier
to
identify
the
problems,
to
point
them
out
to
the
writers
and
to
help
them
figure
out
how
to
solve
them.
The
hardest
part
was
getting
the
students
actively
involved
in
their
revisions.
They
would
often
sit
back
and
expect
me
to
do
all
the
work
and
be
very
unwilling
to
participate
much.
I
am
still
working
on
that
aspect
of
being
a
writing
associate,
because
it
isn't
beneficial
to
the
writer
if
he
or
she
isn't
actively
revising
and
thinking
about
the
paper
but
simply
following
my
observations
of
what
I
point
out
that
needs
work.
They
only
learn
once
they
think
about
their
own
writing
and
what
to
look
for.
Being
a
writing
associate
had
impacts
on
my
own
writing
as
well.
I
paid
an
increasing
amount
of
attention
to
the
ideas
I
talked
about
with
the
students
when
I
wrote.
I
tried
to
follow
the
advice
X
gave
to
them
to
see
if
it
was
sound.
Fortunately,
I
didn't
have
to
challenge
any
of
the
advice
I
gave
out.
I
found
that
what
I
told
them
worked
well
for
me
also.
However,
I
also
started
to
doubt
my
own
writing
after
being
a
W.A.
I
regained
the
confidence
almost
too
much,
thinking
that
I
had
to
do
well,
I
was
a
writing
associate.
If
I
didn't
do
well,
that
meant
I
wasn't
qualified
to
be
one.
I
think
being
a
writing
associate
puts
more
pressure
on
myself
concerning
my
writing.
I
tend
to
place
it
under
a
magnifying
glass
and
look
at
it
in
much
finer
detail.
But
I
look
at
this
as
an
advantage;
it's
an
opportunity
to
become
a
better
writer,
and
to
help
the
writers
I
meet
become
as
enthusiastic
about
their
writing.
