Michael
Returning
Writing
Associate
Assignment
Entering
Senior
Year
August
18,
2003
In
the
past
year,
far
from
the
underclassman
getting
his
feet
wet,
I
have
been
immersed
near
totally
in
the
waters
of
language.
As
a
Writing
Associate
and
as
an
English
major,
even
in
a
Physics
class,
a
great
deal
of
both
reading
and
writing
have
been
required
of
me.
What
these
experiences
have
provided
me
with
is
a
sense
of
the
diversity
of
literary
endeavors,
a
sense
of
audience,
and
a
sense
of
the
nature
of
authorial
intent.
As
a
writer
and
a
Writing
Associate,
one
thing
IOve
realized
very
suddenly
in
the
past
year
is
that
most
writing
is
a
means
towards
an
end.
I
should
quantify
that.
Trying
not
to
sound
cheesy,
IOll
still
say
that
good
writing
is
a
thing
of
beauty,
but
that
beauty
is
not
superficial,
or,
rather,
not
simply
superficial.
Instead,
it
is
comprised
both
of
an
exterior
and
an
interior,
corresponding
approximately
to
what
we
so
frequently
differentiate
as
simply
Lower
and
Higher
order
concerns,
respectively.
Here
I
offer
a
word
of
caution
to
the
new
WAOs
which
will
become
clearer
later
on:
Do
not
make
the
mistake
as
you
focus
on
HOCOs
of
summarily
disregarding
or
unquestioningly
correcting
LOCOs.
Good
writing
doesnOt
merely
sound
good.
If
this
sounds
trivial,
I
havenOt
yet
made
my
point.
To
me,
the
words
are
perhaps
like
cells,
the
sentences
organs,
but
the
idea
behind
it
all
is
a
spirit
that
animates
the
whole.
The
goal
of
most
writing
should
be
to
deliver
that
spirit
unmitigated
and
undiluted.
Too
often
the
tendency
of
young
writers
(including
myself)
is
to
overwhelm
their
ideas
with
too
many
phrases,
disrupting
the
balance
of
superficial
and
substantive
beauty.
IOve
realized
that,
of
the
two,
my
greater
allegiance
is
to
the
idea
expressed
in
the
written
words,
that
same
animating
spirit.
IOve
discovered
that
I
am,
to
the
limits
of
time
and
ability,
a
perfectionist
in
my
writing.
This
works
to
my
advantage
when
time
allows,
but
does
not
expedite
my
work.
I
would
much
rather
work
and
rework
a
piece
of
writing.
It
is
true
that,
when
writing,
I
will
spend
large
amounts
of
time
looking
for
the
perfect,
the
most
appropriate,
the
best-sounding
word.
This
is
where
I
find
that
lower
order
concerns
are
most
important.
When
addressed
properly,
they
can
add
a
sense
of
continuity
to
a
paper,
bringing
the
main
ideas
out
in
even
the
small
aspects
of
a
paper.
They
add
color,
tone,
and
dimension
to
the
thesis.
I
always
attempt
that
apt
turn
of
phrase,
but
when
it
comes
down
to
it,
all
that
effort
is
toward
delivering
a
unified
idea,
one
that
is
organically
consistent
and
coherent
throughout.
This
is
why,
in
addition
to
the
time
and
energy
I
expend
on
phrasing
I
spend
huge
amounts
of
time
searching
for
that
nucleus
of
a
thought
that
IOll
be
able
to
pursue
consistently
as
I
write.
This
becomes,
of
course,
my
thesis
-
an
invariably
slippery
little
devil
thatOs
often
tough
for
me
to
pin
down.
Looking
for
it
is
often
more
a
wait
than
a
search
because
I
hope
in
every
paper
that
I
write
to
produce
something
original.
I
cannot
simply
regurgitate
what
IOve
been
fed
in
the
classroom;
so
many
of
the
ideas
that
occur
to
me
are
immediately
discarded.
My
assignments
as
IOve
advanced
through
the
English
major
requirements
have
largely
become
less
structured,
leaving
room
for
originality,
but
at
the
same
time
creating
the
difficulties
of
indecision
and
misdirection.
I
recall
several
papers
I
had
to
write
in
the
past
year
on
novels
that
I
had
reading
class,
in
which
these
matters
became
especially
problematic.
As
the
classes
involved
had
discussed
the
novels,
many
themes
had
been
identified.
I
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
tracking
the
themes
through
the
novels,
making
notes,
and
looking
for
connections.
Even
so,
I
could
not
draw
any
useful
conclusions.
The
cleverest
sentences
meant
nothing
without
a
useful
idea
behind
them.
In
the
end,
that
work
was
all
wasted.
When
writing,
the
way
I
have
attempted
to
achieve
that
organic
coherence
I
mentioned
earlier
is
through
constant
revision.
People
often
speak
of
drafts
as
complete
and
discernable
entities.
For
me,
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth.
I
edit
perpetually,
as
IOm
sure
many
people
do.
Moreover,
as
I
begin
to
integrate
new
lines
of
reasoning
into
a
paper,
I
will
usually
read
through
from
the
beginning
of
what
IOve
written,
changing
where
possible
the
language
of
the
other
arguments
or
examples
to
reflect
the
additional
information.
It
is
rather
like
mending
moth-eaten
fabric:
the
thread
that
fills
in
the
hole
must
be
woven
into
the
fabric
on
both
sides
of
the
tear
in
order
to
create
a
seamless
integration.
I
am
meticulous
in
my
selection
of
words
and
phrases,
often
evaluating
many
options
for
economic
expression,
connotation,
and
Nfeel.O
I
revise
continually
as
I
write,
taking
such
pains
that
my
work
is
regularly
prolonged.
I
do
this
because
I
believe
that,
when
chosen
with
great
care,
a
writerOs
words,
the
NrightO
words,
achieve
a
meaning
beyond
the
sum
of
the
of
the
parts,
an
un-translatable
meaning.
As
I
mentioned
previously,
each
of
my
experiences
with
writing
in
the
past
year
has
been
unique.
IOve
come
to
appreciate
in
a
whole
new
way
that
what
it
is
for
a
person
to
mean
something
when
the
write.
The
concept
of
the
Intentional
Fallacy
was
not
entirely
new
to
me
before
this
year,
but
it
has
only
now
come
to
mean
something
to
me
as
a
writer
and
not
just
as
a
reader.
Through
literary
criticism,
IOve
developed
an
appreciation
for
the
writerOs
position
under
this
fallacy.
I
understood
before
that
my
interpretations
should
not
be
colored
unnecessarily
be
what
the
author
intended
readerOs
to
perceive
or
acquire
through
a
work.
Now,
because
of
this
knowledge,
I
am
met
with
a
challenge,
though,
because,
if
I
am
to
help
a
student
express
him
or
herself,
I
must
first
understand
what
that
person
means.
That
writerOs
act
of
meaning
is
important
in
our
work.
I
think
it
may
correspond
to
what
I
here
refer
to
as
the
animating
spirit
of
a
paper,
which,
over
and
above
organization,
thesis,
and
clarity
brings
the
words
to
life.
It
is
as
though
that
thought,
that
idea,
exists
incorporeally
until
the
words
are
used
to
give
it
body
and
substance.
I
think
that
is
what
writing
is,
as
attempt
to
bring
into
existence
something
that
exists
insubstantially
as
thought.
That
done,
the
meaning
of
the
piece
of
writing
does
not
become
bound
to
the
thought,
so
the
writer
looses
all
power
to
intend
about
the
work
once
it
is
written.
The
concept
of
the
animating
idea
is
easily
my
governing
principle
as
a
writer,
but,
more
relevantly
now,
it
governs
me
as
a
Writing
Associate
in
my
conferences.
My
hope
has
always
been
to
grasp
a
writerOs
animating
idea
and
help
that
person
tailor
his
or
her
words
to
best
accommodate
it.
Clearly,
what
we
group
together
as
higher
order
concerns
are
the
most
prominent
way
that
the
underlying
idea
is
expressed.
It
is
similar
to
the
thesis,
but
my
concept
of
the
animating
idea
is
more
encompassing
than
that.
It
includes
how
the
writer
feels
about
the
paper
and
its
thesis
and
direction,
as
well
as
what
that
writer
intends
to
do
about
it
(but
as
a
rhetorical,
mental
exercise,
not
as
in
a
summary
of
the
evidence
for
it).
As
a
writer,
I
have
often
mistaken
the
animating
concept
for
a
thesis.
The
results
are
always
wasted
effort
and
frustration.
When
I
produce
a
well-articulated
thesis,
it
is
only
by
first
thoroughly
understanding
my
animating
idea,
because
that
is
what
brings,
not
only
the
paper
to
life,
but
the
writer
as
well
while
he
or
she
is
working
on
the
project,
which
is
why
I
am
so
interested
in
it
as
a
writing
associate.
If
I
can
get
a
hold
of
the
thing
that
makes
a
person
excited
about
their
idea
and
their
paper,
I
can
help
them
pull
the
whole
thing
off
successfully.
If
I
canOt
see
why
someone
else
is
excited
about
an
idea,
how
could
I
motivate
them
to
perform
it
as
well
as
they
can?
In
my
Writing
Associate
adventures
this
year,
I
met
with
a
professor
whose
expectations
aligned
not
at
all
with
my
own
theories
of
writing.
When
I
questioned
this
professor
about
what
good
papers
for
this
class
should
look
like,
I
received
descriptions
of
properly
utilized
charts
and
graphs
and
little
else.
I
was
also
told
that
the
papers
should
be
understandable
to
a
person
of
average
intelligence.
This
professor
gave
the
distinct
impression
that
it
did
not
matter
what
the
students
wrote,
so
long
as
there
were
words
on
the
page
and
those
words
referred
to
a
multitude
of
properly
assembled
charts
and
graphs.
In
the
first
set
of
papers,
I
struggled
to
impose
some
direction
on
the
members
of
the
class
by
elaborating
on
the
professorOs
statements
and
making
inferences
from
his
silences.
We
got
along
reasonably
this
way,
but
I
was
naturally
uncomfortable,
worrying
that
I
might
misdirect
the
class.
I
was
never
able
to
get
any
constructive
feedback
from
the
professor
on
that
first
set
of
papers,
but
what
little
feedback
the
students
received
only
served
to
strengthen
my
perception
of
the
professorOs
priorities.
After
that,
it
became
very
difficult
to
motivate
the
students.
The
concept
of
the
animating
idea
was
wiped
from
the
blackboard
completely,
supplanted
by
diagrams
of
charts.
This
whole
experience
was
very
frustrating
for
me
because
it
minimized
my
role
as
a
WA
in
a
way
that
I
couldnOt
recover
from
during
the
semester.
I
hope
that
my
next
class
will
have
more
emphasis
on
writing
and
the
importance
of
the
Writing
Associate
program.
The
lesson,
for
all
those
young
WAOs
out
there,
is
one
that
youOll
hear
over
and
over,
but
here
it
is
anyway:
the
relationship
between
WA
and
professor
is
crucial,
so
do
everything
you
can
to
ensure
its
strength.
I
never
felt
as
though
the
professor
I
worked
for
had
any
real
respect
for
me
as
tool
or
resource
for
his
class,
and
the
result
was
a
very
frustrating
semester.
My
advice
is
to
display
confidence,
knowledge,
and
responsibility
from
the
moment
you
meet
the
professor
youOre
working
with.
The
WAOs
in
the
program
have
been
selected
according,
partly,
to
these
very
criteria,
so
we
know
weOve
got
the
tools
to
do
our
part
in
facilitating
WA/professor
relationships.
In
time,
I
suppose
each
of
us
comes
up
with
a
way
of
thinking
about
our
writing
that
builds
on
what
weOve
been
taught
and
yet
maintains
our
personal
leanings
in
some
form
or
other.
I
would
encourage
all
WAOs
to
think
about
what
that
means
for
them.
For
me,
it
is
the
animating
idea
that
gets
at
the
heart
of
what
I
do.
These
beginning
of
the
year
papers
can
seem
a
drag,
but
theyOre
a
really
good
opportunity
to
explore
your
opinions
and
to
solidify
your
intentions
as
a
WA
for
the
coming
year.
