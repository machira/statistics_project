The
Journey
From
Infant
to
Writer
It
was
the
first
day
of
summer,
and
Mother
nature
was
exhaustingly
busy.
A
strong
floral
scent
filled
the
air,
tickling
your
nose
as
pleasant
song
drifted
down
from
high
tree
tops
and
danced
about
your
ears.
The
sun's
brilliant
rays
shot
through
the
trees
casting
magnificent
shadows
on
the
grounds
below.
In
the
created
shade,
parents
circled
around
picnic
tables
or
large
blankets
sipping
cold
beverages
while
kids
ran
wildly
playing
Frisbee
and
kick
ball.
It
seemed
as
though
the
entire
population
was
out
and
about
refusing
to
allow
such
an
unusually
perfect
day
to
slip
through
their
fingers.
My
family,
however,
was
unlike
these
carefree
sun
seekers.
Despite
their
complaints
and
general
attitude
that
Lady
luck
had
left
them
stranded,
my
family
was
trapped
in
a
cold,
bare
waiting
room.
The
soothing
floral
scent
had
disappeared
with
the
closing
of
the
outside
doors
leaving
only
an
empty,
sterile
smell
behind.
Besides
the
very
unexciting
magazine
rack,
the
room
was
barely
furnished
with
a
few
simple
chairs
and
end
tables.
But
as
it
was,
my
brothers
were
the
only
ones
bothered
by
the
lack
of
entertainment.
My
mother,
carrying
at
least
fifty
excess
pounds
and
visibly
weary,
on
the
other
hand,
stood
next
to
a
large
desk
debating
with
the
receptionist.
"Now,
Mrs.
Twiste,
we've
been
through
this
once
already
today.
It
was
all
a
big
false
alarm,
you
are
not
going
to
deliver
that
baby
today.
The
doctor
said
its
best
if
you
just
go
home
and
relax..."
My
mother,
quickly
growing
annoyed,
snapped
back
at
her.
"Now
you
listen
to
me!
This
is
not
my
first
child,
it's
my
fifth,
and
I'm
telling
you
that
I
will
not
go
home.
I
am
having
this
baby
today
and
it
won't
be
delivered
in
a
car!'
The
receptionist,
finally
understanding
that
resistance
would
be
of
no
use,
buzzed
the
doctor
who
reluctantly
admitted
my
mother.
But
to
their
surprise,
at
6:26PM
a
brand
new
addition
was
made
to
the
family,
an
enormous
baby
girl.
Looking
as
if
the
result
of
some
strange
DNA
accident,
I
was
fat
with
squinty
eyes
and
jet
black
hair
unlike
anyone,
anywhere
in
my
family.
Regardless
though,
my
life
had
begun
and
my
personality,
abilities
and
weaknesses
would
soon
develop.
Of
course
at
that
age,
being
entirely
too
concerned
with
eating,
sleeping
and
those
relentlessly
taunting
crib
mobiles,
I
hadn't
the
slightest
clue
as
to
what
was
happening
around
me
much
less
within
me.
But,
as
they
usually
do,
with
or
without
my
understanding,
the
years
passed,
and
I
slowly
developed
into
an
individual
with
character
and
personality.
I
was
no
longer
simply
'the
baby'.
Unfortunately
though,
hand
in
hand
with
the
dismissal
of
my
youthful
labels
came
the
incredibly
fabricated
idea
that
I
was
actually
all
grown
up
and
possessed
great
understanding.
However
in
reality,
I
had
nothing
remotely
close
to
this
imagined
comprehension.
When
the
discrepancies
between
fantasy
and
reality
grew
far
too
obvious
even
for
me
to
deny,
I
painfully
admitted
my
ignorance,
but
could
never
entirely
escape
the
attraction
of
my
illusions
nor
the
longing
for
all
they
entailed.
In
fact
I
spent
so
much
time
and
exhausted
so
much
effort
in
yearning
for
that
one
day
I
would
finally
realize
who
I
was--breathlessly
awaiting
that
time
of
fantastic
reality--that
I
forgot
to
pay
attention
to
the
passing
years,
to
those
subtle,
daily
changes
that
actually
created
that
longed
for
understanding.
And
so
I
sit
now
in
the
glory
of
my
realized
fantasy,
finally
convinced
that
I
know
basically,
if
not
exactly,
who
I
am,
but
being
forced
to
pick
through
scattered
memories
in
search
of
some
faded
clues
as
to
how
I
got
to
be
this
way.
One
of
my
earliest
memories,
and
possibly
the
first
clue
in
the
development
of
my
present
writing
fever,
is
of
a
large
table
covered
from
end
to
end
with
every
color
crayon
known
to
man.
The
image,
unable
to
withstand
the
grueling
test
of
time,
is
distant
and
clouded,
but
the
overwhelming
feeling
of
sitting
at
that
table
runs
everlasting
through
my
veins.
I
would
climb
up
into
my
highchair,
dump
my
crayons
and
markers
out
of
the
boxes
and
watch
them
roll
across
the
table
creating
a
beautiful
array
of
color.
From
my
chair
most
of
the
crayons
would
roll
past
my
reach,
but
all
that
mattered
to
me
was
that
I
held
one
in
my
hand.
With
little,
unsteady
fist
I
would
scribble
letters
on
the
paper
before
me.
Having
no
idea
what
the
letters
stood
for
did
not
stop
me
or
destroy
the
amusement
I
received
from
tracing
the
figures
over
and
over
again,
pausing
occasionally
only
to
look
in
awe
at
the
rainbow
of
color
surrounding
me.
Though
quite
strong,
my
infatuation
with
color
and
sight
was
short
lived.
With
time
and
age
it
faded
quickly
into
a
more
dexterous
preoccupation.
Trading
in
my
fat,
baby
crayons
for
much
more
slender,
shapely
pencils,
I
found
something
unusual
and
interesting.
As
if
someone
had
amputated
my
right
hand
and
replaced
it
with
another,
my
clumsy,
shaking
grasp
of
a
crayon
had
molded
into
the
comfortable,
smooth
extension
of
a
pencil.
My
fingers
seemed
to
naturally
fuse
with
the
wood,
sending
a
feeling
of
contentment
throughout
my
entire
body.
The
sensation
was
unlike
anything
I
had
ever
experienced;
so
simple
and
soothing
that
I
was
immediately,
effortlessly
hooked.
Years
passed
with
no
memorable
change
in
my
obsessed
state.
It
wasn't
until
leaving
elementary
school
and
entering
middle
that
my
condition
took
a
sharp
turn.
I
was
sitting
in
a
classroom
half
listening
to
a
lesson
that
seemed
more
like
incoherent
babble
than
anything
important
when
I
was
suddenly
ripped
from
my
private,
little
world.
The
instantaneous
closing
of
at
least
twenty
books
brought
me
to
attention.
Thinking
that
class
was
finally
over
and
ready
to
jump
up
from
my
desk,
I
was
extremely
disturbed
by
the
announcement
of
a
new
homework
assignment.
Automatically
assuming
that
this
would
be
just
another
brainless
task
devised
simply
to
haunt
my
after
school
life,
I
was
completely
surprised
and
intrigued
by
the
mention
of
creative
writing.
My
ears
perked
up
and
for
once
my
attention
was
solely
directed
toward
the
teacher.
The
assignment
was
to
write
a
weekly
creative
essay,
some
with
designated
topics
and
others
complete
free
of
restrictions.
Unhindered
by
the
boos
of
my
classmates,
my
imagination
ran
rampant,
my
mind
surged
with
ideas
and
I
sank
deep
into
my
private
world
once
again.
Throughout
the
year
the
essay
topics
ranged
from
far
fetched
to
outrageous,
from
winning
a
million
dollars
to
little
green
men
from
Mars,
but
regardless
I
would
rush
home
with
whatever
theme,
eager
to
begin.
As
soon
as
I
reached
home,
I
would
sit
closed
up
in
my
room
with
paper
and
pen
in
hand,
growing
dizzy
from
the
pounding
flood
of
thoughts.
My
hand
would
get
cramped
and
tired,
unable
to
keep
up
with
the
rapid
pace
of
my
ideas,
but
that
could
not
stop
me.
I
would
write
page
after
page,
completely
absorbed
by
my
imagination.
My
mental
world
and
the
inventions
of
my
mind
became
so
controlling
that
the
once
incredible
sensation
of
simple
holding
a
pencil
in
my
hand
was
lost.
By
itself,
a
pencil
was
now
nothing
more
than
a
hard
piece
of
wood
resting
between
my
fingers.
My
infatuation
had
been
transferred
from
something
of
a
physical
nature
to
something
entirely
mental.
I
was
addicted
to
the
spinning,
light-headed
rush
of
swelling
thoughts,
thoughts
that
could
only
be
sparked
through
the
act
of
writing.
Once
again
years
passed
by
unnoticably.
My
love
of
writing
and
the
feeling
it
created
remained
strong
and
constant
for
some
time.
However,
in
leaving
middle
school,
the
opportunities
to
unleash
my
imagination
and
stimulate
my
mind
grew
far
too
uncommon.
High
school,
ultimately
proving
detrimental
to
my
desire
to
write,
wound
up
being
four
years
of
strict
memorization.
If
I
knew
what
was
written
on
page
ten
of
my
textbook
then
I
aced
the
chapter
test.
If
I
could
recall
the
color
of
some
woman's
dress
in
a
novel
I
was
forced
to
read
then
I
did
well
on
the
multiple
choice.
But
as
for
creativity
or
even
interpretation?
Discussion?
Opinion?
No
such
things
existed
within
the
realm
of
my
classes.
Memorize,
remember,
study,
know--it
was
all
some
sort
of
twisted,
never
ending
circle
of
nonsense.
Within
a
few
years,
my
burning
desire
to
write
was
completely
extinguished,
the
pleasing
dizziness
of
trampling
thoughts
replaced
by
frustration.
There
was
nothing
for
me
to
write
about
beyond
some
president's
biography.
There
was
nothing
for
me
to
think
about
beyond
some
crayfish's
intestinal
system.
I
had
no
avenues
to
travel,
no
back
roads
to
investigate;
I
was
trapped
within
my
high
schools
sad
curriculum.
I
struggled
to
break
free,
but
my
body
was
sluggish
with
exhaustion.
I
searched
for
something
to
excite
my
mind,
but
my
head
had
already
started
to
decay.
The
truth
was
that
I
simply
had
no
desire
to
think,
I
wanted
the
teacher
to
tell
me
exactly
what
to
do
and
when
to
do
it.
I,
of
course,
did
not
want
to
admit
my
pitiful
condition
or
that
I
had
become
something
I
always
hated,
but
I
knew
something
had
to
change,
something
had
to
give.
I
would
leave
high
school
too
eventually
and
I
refused
to
live
the
rest
of
my
life
a
thoughtless,
mindless
regurgitator.
I
would
not
allow
high
school
to
be
the
death
of
me.
I
would
fight
to
the
bitter
My
only
retaliation
was
to
reach
deep
inside
and
rekindle
my
love
of
writing,
to
define
that
powerful,
magnificent
surge
of
thought
once
more.
And
so
I
sat
down
with
pen
in
hand
and
to
my
surprise
scribbled
line
after
line.
The
thoughts
appeared
out
of
nowhere
and
were
uncontrollable.
Like
a
roller
coast,
they
built
up
gradually
and
came
crashing
down
at
incredible
speeds,
turning
this
way
and
twisting
that.
The
old
familiar
feeling
was
back,
but
this
time
I
would
not
let
it
wiggle
from
my
grasp
so
easily.
I
knew
in
that
instant
I
would
never
again
be
without
my
infatuation,
but
that
occasionally
it
would
find
a
quiet
place
somewhere
deep
inside
and
rest.
In
retrospect
however,
I
see
that
realization
in
new
and
different
light.
As
I
said
before,
I
wasn't
paying
close
attention
to
my
development
as
a
person,
but
rather
waiting
patiently
for
the
one
day
that
person
emerged.
Had
I
been
more
alert,
I
probably
would
have
noticed
right
then
and
there
that
I
had
become
a
dedicated,
addicted
writer.
