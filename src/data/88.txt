Over
the
past
year
I
have
had
several
new,
as
well
as
numerous
old,
writing
experiences.
At
times
I
was
challenged
by
a
whole
new
writing
style,
by
length
constraints
that
were
placed
upon
my
papers,
and
by
an
entirely
different
set
of
cultural
expectations.
At
other
times
I
was
not
challenged
at
all
as
I
wrote
papers
as
I
had
been
doing
since
I
entered
college.
Finally,
I
think
I
learned
a
little,
if
not
a
lot,
from
my
experiences
in
conferences
with
other
students
as
a
WA.
First
semester
last
year
I
found
myself
with
a
course
load
that
demanded
from
me
to
be
a
different
type
of
writer
with
every
paper
I
wrote.
I
had
two
psychology
courses,
one
of
which
asked
me
to
write
lab
reports
on
experiments
conducted
in
class.
The
reports
were
to
be
written
in
a
manner
such
that
it
be
conceivable
they
could
be
printed
in
a
credited
journal.
This
is
a
very
straightforward,
and
a
very
difficult,
assignment.
As
anyone
who
has
written
such
a
lab
report
knows,
there
is
a
very
rigid
set
of
guidelines
that
must
be
followed
precisely
and
which
a
report
must
meet
in
order
to
be
considered
worthy
of
a
journal.
As
a
result,
very
little
creativity
is
asked
for
in
such
a
report.
Writing
sort
of
takes
on
a
machine-like
tone
in
that
every
paper
is
written
the
same
way,
where
it
often
feels
that
the
only
variation
between
different
reports
are
the
numbers
that
are
substituted
from
one
experiment
to
the
next.
This
is
a
very
challenging
assignment
because
the
writer
knows
that
the
content
of
the
report,
while
still
important,
is
not
as
crucial
as
usual,
and
that
the
report
will
be
scrutinized
for
its
conformability
to
the
rules,
something
to
which
I
am
not
all
that
accustomed.
In
complete
contrast
to
my
psychology
courses,
I
was
enrolled
in
my
first
ever
political
science
class
which
demanded
that
I
be
more
creative
with
my
writing
than
I
had
ever
been
previously.
This
class
presented
to
me
one
of
my
greatest
challenges
as
a
writer,
and
one
which,
if
grades
are
chosen
as
an
evaluator,
I
never
fully
overcame.
Writing
a
political
paper,
our
professor
explained,
is
different
from
writing
any
other
type
of
paper.
Essentially,
in
writing
a
political
theory
paper
it
is
necessary
to
devise
a
problem
that
confronts
people
today,
relate
that
problem
to
a
relevant
situation
in
the
past,
then
proceed
to
debate
how
the
two
opposing
sides
in
the
past
would
address
the
present
issue,
and
finally
to
conclude
how
best
this
issue
should
be
resolved.
At
least,
that
is
how
I
think
a
political
theory
paper
is
supposed
to
be
written,
however
I
never
quite
mastered
the
technique
and
am
thus
not
sure.
These
papers
posed
such
a
great
challenge
for
me
because
I
had
to
throw
out
the
writing
style
that
I
had
developed
over
my
lifetime
in
favor
for
a
style
for
which
I
did
not
know
and,
subsequently,
did
not
care.
I
was
able,
of
course,
to
retain
my
skills
in
organization,
flow,
and
grammar,
but
this
new
writing
style
really
stumped
me.
I
can
recall
sitting
in
front
of
my
computer
for
ten
hour
stretches,
desperately
attempting
to
get
out
a
mere
first
draft.
I
struggled
with
every
aspect
of
these
papers,
and
I
never
felt
good
about
my
finished
product.
I
talked
to
other
WA's
about
the
papers,
and
I
know
that
several
of
them,
who
were
also
in
the
class,
were
finding
the
papers
difficult.
Basically,
I
felt
like
I
was
back
in
high
school
and
I
did
not
know
yet
how
to
write.
Thankfully,
I
had
one
other
class
last
year
in
which
I
could
use
my
traditional
writing
style.
However,
even
these
papers
were
a
little
more
difficult
than
usual
in
that
I
was
forced
to
smash
five
to
seven
pages
worth
of
information
into
a
mere
three
pages.
I
found
it
quite
challenging
to
get
all
of
the
main
points
across
in
such
a
tight
constraint.
I
could
easily
make
the
paper
fit
the
three
page
requirement
by
ignoring
or
not
fully
explaining
part
of
the
argument,
but
I
knew
that
was
a
poor
technique
to
use.
I
found
myself
trying
very
hard
to
cut
out
the
unnecessary
blabble
that
I
often
use
in
papers,
the
stuff
that
sounds
real
good
but
really
is
not
anything
more
than
space
fluff.
However,
this
was
not
always
enough,
and
I
soon
began
playing
with
fonts
and
margins
to
make
everything
fit.
Essentially,
I
resorted
to
cheating,
but
to
this
day
I
am
not
sure
that
it
is
possible
to
write
out
every
important
aspect
of
those
arguments
in
a
mere
three
pages.
Aside
from
writing
papers
that
semester,
I
also
acted
officially
as
a
WA
for
the
first
time.
I
had
a
freshman
seminar
class,
and
I
was
quickly
confronted
with
students
with
a
wide
variety
of
writing
skills.
Of
course,
I
had
one
or
two
students
who
really
did
not
appear
to
need
much
help,
at
least
of
the
type
a
WA
offers.
Most
of
the
students,
however,
did
require
some
aid,
namely
in
the
organizational
field.
The
other
major
problem
I
saw
in
the
student's
writing
was
a
tendency
to
assume
that
the
reader
is
as
intelligent
about
the
subject
matter
as
the
student
him
or
herself.
I
think
that
identifying
the
most
common
and
most
blatant
errors
in
my
student's
writing
has
helped
me
both
as
a
writer
and
as
a
WA.
In
my
own
writing
I
am
more
aware
than
ever
about
avoiding
the
major
writing
mistakes.
As
a
WA
I
think
I
am
better
able
to
aid
students
with
their
writing
now
that
I
know
some
of
the
areas
in
which
they
are
likely
to
need
the
most
help.
I
have
also
had
more
practice
in
these
areas
and
am
developing
methods
that
are
more
likely
to
effectively
convey
my
message
to
the
students
without
me
preaching
to
them
as
a
teacher.
Working
with
students
has
also
helped
me
to
understand
how
varied
students
are
with
their
writing
skills
and
experiences,
and
this
is
helpful
knowledge
to
have
in
any
WA
conference.
During
the
second
semester
of
last
year
I
was
fortunate
to
be
able
to
participate
in
a
study
abroad
program
in
Spain.
This
was
an
extremely
rewarding
experience
as
I
learned
much
about
another
culture,
my
culture,
and
myself.
My
classes
were
not
very
difficult
in
Spain,
serving
only
as
a
supplement
to
the
cultural
experience.
As
a
result,
most
of
the
papers
I
wrote
were
not
all
that
challenging,
with
only
one
exception.
In
my
Art
class,
a
class
taught
entirely
in
Spanish,
I
was
required
to
write
a
seven
page
research
paper
in
Spanish.
While
I
had
written
very
short
papers
in
Spanish
before,
I
had
never
before
written
one
so
long
and
complex.
In
writing
this
paper
I
chose
what
is
probably
the
least
recommended
course
of
action;
I
decided
to
write
the
paper
first
in
English
and
then
translate
it
into
Spanish.
I
knew
this
was
not
all
that
wise,
and
that
I
should
probably
try
to
write
the
paper
from
the
start
in
Spanish,
but
I
was
not
comfortable
enough
with
my
Spanish
skills
to
do
this.
When
attempting
to
translate
my
words
as
directly
as
possible,
I
encountered
the
same
language
barriers
and
difficulties
that
had
always
plagued
me
when
I
tried
to
verbally
speak
Spanish.
For
instance,
oftentimes
in
Spanish,
but
not
always,
the
verb
proceeds
the
noun.
However,
this
often
gets
lost
in
a
direct
English
translation
as
the
natural
tendency
is
to
always
place
the
noun
first.
It
was
differences
such
as
this
that
made
my
translation
extremely
difficult
and
nerve
racking.
When
I
completed
the
paper,
I
had
one
of
the
family
members
with
whom
I
was
living
proofread
it.
She
had
many
laughs
and
hardships
in
trying
to
correct
my
grammar.
For
my
part,
I
had
a
couple
of
occasions
where
she
asked
me
to
proofread
something
she
had
written
for
her
English
class.
It
was
at
these
times
that
I
had
the
opportunity
to
laugh
at
the
errors
she
made.
What
I
noticed
at
these
times,
however,
were
the
common
mistakes
that
native
Spanish
speakers
make
when
trying
to
learn
English.
I
realized
that
these
mistakes
were
essentially
the
identical
errors
that
most
native
English
speakers
have
when
trying
to
learn
Spanish.
Seeing
these
mistakes
greatly
aided
me
to
understand
for
the
first
time
the
grammatical
rules
that
I
learned
in
class,
which
in
turn
helped
both
my
Spanish
writing
and
speaking
ability.
Throughout
the
course
of
last
year
I
had
many
experiences
and
challenges
to
my
writing
ability.
I
once
thought
that
I
had
very
much
matured
as
a
writer
and
that
I
had
reached
near
my
full
capacity.
I
realize
now,
however,
that
my
writing
skills
are
continuing
to
evolve
and
that
I
still
have
much
to
learn.
I
do
not
think
that
anybody
has
reached
the
pinnacle
of
his
or
her
writing
ability
since
there
is
always
room
for
improvement.
As
my
senior
year
rapidly
approaches,
I
look
forward,
with
mixed
ambivalence
I
must
admit,
to
the
challenges
that
await
me.
