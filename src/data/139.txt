Literacy
Narrative
8/97
As
a
beginning
WA
last
year,
I
had
no
idea
that
working
with
other
students
on
their
writing
issues
would
have
such
an
effect
on
my
own
written
work.
I
began
my
job
as
a
WA
thinking
that
I
needed
little
improvement
as
a
writer,
but
working
with
other
students
on
their
work
showed
me
ways
that
I
could
improve
my
own
writing,
and
helped
me
identify
and
work
out
many
of
my
own
writing
difficulties.
Over
the
past
year
I
have
learned
how
to
communicate
with
both
students
and
teachers
on
issues
related
to
writing,
as
well
as
how
to
think
clearly
and
objectively
about
my
own
work.
My
first
WA
assignment
was
important
not
only
because
I
learned
a
lot
about
dealing
with
people,
but
also
because
it
drew
my
attention
to
grammatical
issues
that
I'd
never
paid
attention
to
before.
I
had
always
been
able
to
proofread
and
correct
my
papers,
mainly
because
I
was
able
to
pick
things
out
that
"didn't
sound
right"
and
fix
them.
This
was
true
for
conceptual
and
organizational
issues
as
well
as
grammatical
ones.
When
I
became
a
WA,
I
discovered
that
telling
students
that
things
"just
didn't
sound
right"
was
not
an
acceptable
way
to
help
them
improve
their
writing.
This
was
especially
evident
in
my
first
WA
assignment,
which
was
an
FYS.
The
students
were
struggling
with
problems
like
sentence
structure
and
basic
organization,
and
I
was
forced
to
explain
what
exactly
was
incorrect
about
their
work.
At
first
I
felt
inadequate,
mainly
because
I
had
trouble
verbalizing
about
writing
errors.
This
difficulty
was
resolved
in
several
different
ways.
First
of
all,
I
began
to
refer
to
St.
Martin's
handbook,
and
familiarized
myself
with
a
lot
of
unfamiliar
terminology.
Secondly,
I
made
an
effort
to
use
these
terms
in
my
student
conferences,
and
soon
I
was
able
to
explain
to
students
exactly
why
their
errors
were
grammatically
incorrect.
I
also
became
better
at
explaining
how
to
improve
organization.
This
was
due
in
part
to
things
I
learned
at
WA
staff
meetings,
and
in
part
to
the
fact
that
I
actually
began
to
think
about
what
makes
writing
awkward
and
disorganized.
Perhaps
my
new
awareness
of
writing
issues
should
have
made
me
a
more
confident
writer,
but
at
first
it
seemed
to
have
the
opposite
effect.
When
writing
papers
for
my
English
class,
I
found
myself
stopping
constantly
to
check
St.
Martin's
handbook.
Most
of
the
time
my
work
was
correct,
but
my
confidence
seemed
shaken
by
my
recent
discovery
that
I
did
not
in
fact
know
everything
about
writing.
I
had
been
spending
a
lot
of
time
with
the
students
in
the
FYS
working
on
introductory
paragraphs,
and
suddenly
I
began
to
scrutinize
my
own
introductions.
They
didn't
seem
good
enough.
I
became
very
dissatisfied
with
my
own
writing,
and
it
showed
in
the
papers
I
produced
for
my
classes.
One
paper
in
particular
was
accompanied
by
several
pages
containing
various
introductory
and
concluding
paragraphs
that
I
had
written
and
discarded.
They
convey
how
frustrated
I
was
with
my
own
work.
Looking
back
at
these
papers
I
wrote
during
my
first
semester
as
a
WA,
it
is
clear
to
me
that
my
writing
was
evolving
during
this
time.
Although
some
of
the
things
I
wrote
during
this
time
seemed
awkward,
by
the
end
of
that
semester
I
had
developed
a
new
writing
style,
and
new
skills
for
writing
introductory
and
concluding
paragraphs.
Several
of
these
skills
were
developed
during
WA
conferences.
For
example,
one
of
the
students
I
was
working
with
had
trouble
writing
introductions
that
fit
the
subject
matter
of
his
papers.
After
we
discussed
exactly
what
the
role
of
an
introduction
is,
this
student
remarked
that
he
couldn't
write
a
good
introduction
when
he
was
beginning
to
write
a
paper
because
he
didn't
know
exactly
what
he
was
going
to
say
that
early
on
in
the
process.
It
occurred
to
me
that
maybe
it
wouldn't
hurt
to
write
the
introduction
last,
after
the
paper
was
completed.
I
suggested
this
to
the
student,
and
as
the
semester
went
on,
he
found
that
this
technique
worked
well
for
him.
I
tried
it
myself,
and
discovered
that
my
introductions
fit
the
subject
matter
of
my
papers
best
if
I
rewrote
them
after
reading
the
completed
draft
of
my
paper.
I
distinctly
recall
a
feeling
of
gratification
upon
receiving
a
paper
marked
"good
intro"
at
the
top.
At
the
same
time
that
I
was
resolving
difficulties
and
enjoying
success
in
my
writing,
I
was
learning
to
help
the
students
that
I
worked
with
do
the
same
with
their
own
work.
Although
I
got
over
my
initial
difficulties
with
verbalizing
about
writing
errors,
I
faced
other
obstacles
in
my
conferences
that
were
not
so
easy
to
handle.
The
FYS
students
that
I
worked
with
as
a
beginning
WA
surprised
me
with
their
indifference
about
their
assignments.
I
don't
believe
that
they
were
indifferent
about
completing
their
work.
Instead,
I
think
that
they
had
trouble
getting
interested
in
the
topics
that
they
had
to
write
about.
So
for
awhile,
I
was
focused
not
only
on
writing
improvements,
but
also
on
how
to
help
the
students
relate
their
work
to
things
that
they
were
interested
in.
At
one
time
the
students
were
writing
papers
on
the
death
practices
of
foreign
cultures.
Many
of
the
papers
lacked
descriptive
sentences
and
seemed
flat
and
uninteresting.
I
took
this
as
a
sign
that
the
students
were
having
trouble
getting
interested
in
the
topic.
I
tried
to
help
the
students
gain
interest
in
their
assignment
by
helping
them
relate
foreign
death
rituals
to
our
own.
I
also
tried
to
help
them
understand
and
appreciate
the
foreign
cultures
they
were
writing
about
by
constantly
asking
them
"Why
do
you
think
they
do
this
the
way
they
do?",
"What
purpose
does
this
ritual
serve?"
and
"Do
we
have
any
rituals
in
our
country
that
serve
the
same
purpose?".
These
questions
seemed
to
foster
their
interest
in
the
people
that
they
were
writing
about,
as
well
as
stimulate
them
to
analyze
the
people
and
the
situations
that
they
were
writing
about.
After
that
round
of
conferences
was
finished,
I
met
with
the
professor
to
go
over
the
papers
and
discuss
the
next
assignment.
When
he
asked
me
what
I
thought
of
the
past
assignment,
I
decided
to
share
my
concerns
about
the
student's
lack
of
interest
in
the
assigned
topics.
I
told
him
about
the
student's
difficulties
with
their
assignments
and
about
the
questions
I
had
designed
to
make
them
think
about
interesting
aspects
of
foreign
cultures.
He
seemed
to
think
that
they
were
a
good
way
to
encourage
analytical
thought
and
creativity
among
the
students.
To
my
surprise,
the
next
paper
assignment
he
distributed
contained
a
list
of
questions
similar
to
the
ones
I
had
posed
previously
along
with
a
sentence
or
two
encouraging
them
to
focus
on
the
aspects
of
the
foreign
culture
that
interested
the
writer
most.
I
was
really
pleased
that
the
professor
thought
my
input
was
so
important.
Looking
back,
I
think
that
that
was
one
of
the
most
positive
experiences
I
have
had
in
my
work
as
a
WA.
The
issue
of
posing
questions
in
order
to
initiate
thought
and
more
analytical
writing
became
important
to
me
in
my
classes
as
well.
The
fact
that
it
seemed
to
work
so
well
for
the
students
I
was
working
with
encouraged
me
to
try
it
for
myself.
When
I
hit
a
brick
wall
while
writing
a
paper,
I
would
try
to
come
up
with
questions
about
the
subject
that
would
put
me
back
on
track
again.
This
was
especially
helpful
with
English
papers.
I
would
write
down
a
couple
of
fundamental
questions
that
my
paper
was
trying
to
address
and
would
refer
to
them
regularly
to
make
sure
that
I
hadn't
strayed
off
my
topic.
For
example,
while
writing
a
paper
about
Sylvia
Plath,
I
made
a
question
sheet
that
contained
questions
such
as
"What
exactly
about
her
work
made
it
autobiographical?"
and
"What
tools
did
she
use
to
convey
her
emotions
to
the
reader?".
Not
only
did
my
questions
make
me
think
more
about
my
topic,
they
also
helped
keep
me
focused
on
my
thesis.
Interestingly
enough,
I
was
able
to
use
these
questions
to
formulate
well
focused
introductions
as
well.
This
was
another
step
towards
resolving
my
difficulties
with
introductory
paragraphs.
My
second
semester
as
a
WA
I
worked
with
a
group
of
Sophomores
in
an
Engineering
Ethics
class.
As
a
Biology
major,
I
found
this
class
particularly
interesting
because
many
of
the
issues
that
the
class
dealt
with
were
environmental
in
nature.
On
the
whole,
the
students
in
this
class
were
dealing
with
higher
order
concerns.
Their
concerns
centered
around
providing
ample
support
for
a
thesis
through
a
series
of
logical
progressions.
Sometimes
their
support
was
lacking,
and
sometimes
their
work
just
wasn't
organized
enough.
Working
on
thesis
support
and
organization
with
the
students
drew
my
attention
to
my
own
work
once
again.
During
this
time
I
was
not
taking
any
English
classes,
and
most
of
my
writing
related
in
one
way
or
another
to
my
laboratory
work.
I
was
spending
a
lot
of
time
writing
research
proposals
that
semester,
and
my
focus
had
become
supporting
my
thesis
(which
was,
in
this
case,
a
scientific
hypothesis)
without
a
lot
of
superfluous
description.
The
students
I
was
working
with
were
experiencing
similar
problems
while
writing
a
paper
based
upon
a
cost
benefit
analysis.
Not
only
did
they
have
a
stiff
limit
on
the
length
of
their
paper,
but
the
professor
wanted
them
to
discuss
a
wide
series
of
issues.
We
all
faced
the
same
challenge:
proving
a
point
in
as
few
words
as
possible.
I
have
always
been
the
type
of
writer
who
loves
language.
I
like
words,
and
I
like
using
a
lot
of
creative
descriptions
in
my
written
work.
Getting
straight
to
the
point
with
no
artistic
word
use
at
all
was
an
intimidating
task.
A
lot
of
the
students
in
the
Ethics
class
felt
the
same
way.
After
helping
them
with
their
papers,
and
after
spending
a
lot
of
time
on
my
own
research
proposal
for
my
Independent
Study
project,
I
developed
certain
strategies
that
helped
me
avoid
being
too
wordy.
First
of
all,
I
found
it
helpful
to
outline
exactly
what
I
needed
to
say
in
my
paper
before
I
sat
down
to
write
it.
Secondly,
I
would
set
the
finished
paper
aside
for
awhile
and
then
I
would
go
back
and
reread
it,
removing
unnecessary
statements
and
rewriting
sentences
that
were
too
wordy.
I
picked
this
method
up
from
the
students
I
was
working
with.
Many
of
them
would
come
to
the
conference,
pick
up
their
paper,
and
immediately
pick
out
problems
with
it
that
they
hadn't
noticed
when
they
handed
it
in.
It
seemed
as
if
setting
the
paper
aside
for
awhile
helped
them
to
clear
their
minds
and
approach
the
paper
from
a
more
critical,
objective
angle.
Of
course,
the
best
way
to
learn
to
write
succinct
technical
documents
is
to
practice.
I
still
don't
think
I've
quite
mastered
it
yet.
One
of
the
other
assignments
that
the
Ethics
class
worked
on
was
a
presentation.
The
students
worked
in
groups
of
four
and
were
required
to
submit
a
paper
upon
which
their
presentation
would
be
based.
My
job
was
to
help
them
with
their
papers,
and
also
to
help
them
prepare
a
presentation
that
reflected
what
they
had
written
in
their
papers.
Since
this
was
a
group
project
I
ended
up
having
conferences
with
groups
of
students.
At
first
I
thought
meeting
with
a
group
of
students
would
not
work
well,
since
I
would
not
be
able
to
interact
with
each
student
as
much
as
I
would
have
liked.
It
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
more
positive
experiences
I
have
had
as
a
WA.
When
I
met
with
my
first
group
to
go
over
their
presentation,
they
had
nothing
to
show
me,
except
for
their
papers
(which
I
had
already
read).
The
problem
seemed
to
be
that
they
weren't
sure
how
to
adapt
what
they
had
written
separately
into
something
that
they
could
present
as
a
group.
This
problem
was
familiar
to
me
because
I
was
working
on
a
group
presentation
for
one
of
my
own
classes.
I
tried
to
help
them
define
the
most
important
issues,
and
then
they
decided
who
would
cover
each
topic.
Finally,
we
worked
on
connecting
the
issues
to
the
main
point
of
the
presentation.
It
was
difficult
taking
each
students
written
work
and
adapting
it
for
a
presentation,
especially
since
not
everyone
in
the
group
had
written
about
the
same
topic.
The
group
dynamic
was
what
made
these
conferences
so
interesting.
In
most
of
the
groups,
a
leader
emerged
who
was
willing
to
make
decisions
and
take
more
responsibility
for
speaking
during
the
presentation
itself.
There
was
usually
at
least
one
student
in
each
group
who
was
unsure
or
indifferent
about
the
topic
and
seemed
less
willing
to
take
a
large
role
in
the
presentation.
Some
students
disagreed
with
each
other
about
what
part
of
the
presentation
was
most
important
and
which
parts
could
be
removed.
I
really
enjoyed
working
with
the
students
in
the
group
setting.
They
were
less
reserved
and
more
open
about
their
ideas
because
they
were
with
their
friends.
It
enabled
me
to
interact
with
them
in
a
more
relaxed
manner
and
they
seemed
more
willing
to
ask
questions.
In
spite
of
the
fact
that
these
conferences
were
so
successful,
they
brought
an
interesting
question
to
light:
How
does
one
adapt
written
work
so
that
it
is
effective
as
spoken
words?
I
was
having
problems
turning
my
research
paper
into
a
presentation
for
class.
I
was
faced
with
a
lot
of
the
same
questions
that
the
students
in
the
Ethics
class
had
been
trying
to
resolve.
What
are
the
most
important
points
that
the
paper
makes?
How
do
you
connect
these
points
when
you
are
speaking
so
that
they
make
as
much
sense
as
they
did
on
paper?
How
do
you
know
what
to
rule
out?
I
am
a
lot
more
comfortable
writing
than
I
am
speaking.
It
is
hard
to
take
the
easy
tone
of
a
confident
writer
and
convert
it
to
confidence
in
spoken
word
when
the
speaker
is
not
sure
of
herself.
I
wrote
my
presentation,
and
it
was
good,
but
I
don't
think
it
was
as
effective
in
proving
my
point
as
my
paper
was.
Maybe
this
was
because
I
was
nervous
about
speaking
in
front
of
a
large
group
of
people,
but
I
think
that
more
than
likely
this
was
because
I
was
aware
that
I
could
not
go
back
and
erase
something
I
had
spoken.
You
can't
go
back
and
edit
something
you
have
said,
adjusting
it
until
you
are
confident
that
it
is
perfect
in
form
and
meaning.
This
is
the
advantage
of
written
communication.
This
problem
converting
my
written
work
to
verbal
presentation
is
something
that
I
am
still
working
on.
As
I
get
ready
to
begin
my
second
year
as
a
WA,
I
realize
how
much
I
have
learned
by
being
a
WA
so
far.
Most
importantly,
I
have
learned
that
being
a
WA
does
not
simply
involve
teaching
other
students
how
to
be
better
writers.
It
is
also
a
chance
for
me
to
listen
to
other
people
explain
their
difficulties
with
writing
while
considering
my
own
difficulties
as
a
writer.
More
often
than
not,
I
think
the
WA
and
the
writer
puzzle
out
the
solutions
to
the
problems
together,
and
each
benefits
from
the
exchange
of
ideas.
The
student
comes
away
knowing
that
he
or
she
is
not
alone
with
their
writing
difficulties,
while
the
WA
learns
new
writing
strategies
and
techniques
that
they
can
share
with
others.
I
am
looking
forward
to
the
opportunity
to
continue
helping
students
with
their
writing,
and
learning
about
how
to
improve
my
own
writing
habits
this
fall.
