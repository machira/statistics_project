Literacy
Narrative
August
27,
1999
I
am
now
embarking
on
a
journey
through
my
final
year
of
college
and
my
final
year
as
a
Writing
Associate.
As
a
senior,
I
will
be
looking
forward
to
the
future
and
what
it
may
hold;
but,
I
will
also
be
looking
to
the
past
in
order
to
ascertain
how
prepared
I
will
be.
Since
I
am
considering
the
option
of
attending
law
school,
writing
will
no
doubt
be
an
integral
part
of
my
continuing
education.
Therefore,
my
experience
as
a
writing
associate
will
undoubtedly
help
my
chances
at
being
a
successful
law
student.
As
a
Writing
Associate,
I
am
not
only
required
to
write
papers,
but
now,
I
am
called
upon
to
read
and
evaluate
papers
as
well.
This
poses
numerous
challenges
for
me.
As
a
Writing
Associate,
would
I
become
complacent
as
a
writer
and
not
attempt
to
improve
myself
while
I
was
helping
others?
I
think
about
the
students
I
will
be
working
with,
and
I
wonder
if
they
will
actually
consider
my
suggestions
to
them.
I
also
wonder
if
professors
will
be
satisfied
with
my
advice
to
their
students.
Am
I
prepared
enough
to
tackle
subjects
like
economic
parity
and
Shakespeare?
Sure,
I
have
read
other
people's
papers
before.
All
through
high
school
and
even
in
college,
peer
editing
was
often
a
part
of
the
writing
process.
However,
never
before
was
I
recognized
as
an
authority,
or
someone
who
was
able
distinguish
good
writing
from
bad.
Had
I
gone
as
far
as
I
could
possibly
go
as
a
writer?
Was
there
anything
more
to
learn?
As
a
Writing
Associate,
I
am
less
worried
about
receiving
writing
assignments
than
I
am
about
taking
exams.
However,
at
times,
these
writing
assignments
can
be
difficult
and
somewhat
burdensome,
especially
those
issued
by
professors
in
the
Government
and
Law
Department.
In
two
Constitutional
Law
classes
that
I
took
this
past
year,
I
was
required
to
write
in
a
manner
tailored
to
the
legal
profession.
Missing
was
the
freedom
to
choose
one's
own
format
and
writing
style.
This
would
be
easier,
I
thought,
as
my
writing
would
merely
be
a
mirror
image
of
previous
case
notes
and
legal
briefs.
However,
I
soon
found
out
that
despite
reliance
on
precedence,
forging
new
ideas
as
an
extension
of
precedence
was
a
challenging
task.
And,
as
a
writing
associate,
I
found
that
I
was
writing
as
if
there
was
someone
looking
over
my
shoulder
the
entire
time.
As
I
hurriedly
wrote
my
case
notes
and
legal
briefs,
I
found
that
my
writing
process
had
changed.
I
was
not
strictly
a
writer
anymore.
Now,
I
was
editing
while
I
was
writing.
Granted,
everyone
goes
through
a
similar
process
of
editing
their
work
while
they
are
writing
it.
However,
I
felt
that
while
I
was
writing,
I
was
acting
not
as
an
author
fixing
his
own
work,
but
rather
as
an
editor
apart
from
the
author
who
looks
at
the
writing
from
a
separate
point
of
view.
I
was
almost
as
if
I
was
having
writing
conferences
with
myself
as
I
was
writing
the
papers.
Thus,
I
did
not
write
with
a
false
sense
of
security.
Rather,
my
awareness
was
heightened
as
I
gained
more
experience
as
a
peer
editor.
When
I
write,
I
try
to
hold
myself
to
higher
standards;
although,
I
have
found
that
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
practice
what
I
preach.
It
is
funny
that
I
can
spend
an
entire
conference
talking
about
the
importance
of
a
strong
thesis
and
then
sit
down
and
attempt
to
write
a
paper
without
one.
However,
since
I
have
become
a
more
careful
reader,
my
writing
should
improve
as
well.
Unless,
of
course,
I
do
not
want
to
follow
my
own
advice.
As
a
Writing
Associate,
I
have
worked
with
all
kinds
of
students
with
various
backgrounds
and
writing
styles.
It
has
been
a
challenge
for
me
to
motivate
those
students
who
lack
confidence
in
their
writing
ability
or
have
little
interest
in
talking
about
their
work.
However,
I
feel
that
the
biggest
challenge
is
adapting
to
the
writing
styles
of
others.
Sometimes,
as
an
editor,
I
think
that
something
is
wrong
because
it
is
stated
in
a
manner
different
from
what
I
would
have
chosen.
A
Writing
Associate
has
to
realize
that
every
individual
has
their
own
style
of
writing,
and
in
order
to
help
these
individuals,
you
must
avoid
injecting
your
own.
Sometimes,
when
a
professor
assigns
only
a
single
paper
topic,
many
papers
end
up
saying
the
same
thing,
only
in
different
ways.
Writing
Associates
can
learn
from
these
different
writing
styles,
and
perhaps
employ
them
in
their
own
writing.
They
can
also
learn
different
methods
that
other
students
use
to
facilitate
the
writing
process.
I
have
grown
as
a
writer
through
discussions
with
the
professors
for
whom
I
have
worked
as
a
Writing
Associate.
In
my
first
two
years,
I
have
worked
with
Dr.
Hal
Hochman,
an
economics
professor,
who
emphasizes
the
importance
of
a
forceful
argument.
In
his
First
Year
Seminar,
students
are
required
to
take
positions
on
different
economic
issues
and
explain
why
they
chose
those
positions.
In
describing
what
he
expected
in
his
students'
papers,
he
explained
to
me
the
dynamics
of
a
cogent
argument.
And,
while
working
with
the
students,
I
saw
numerous
methods
that
writers
may
use
to
write
a
position
paper.
In
my
two
years
as
a
Writing
Associate,
I
also
have
worked
with
Ian
Smith,
an
English
professor,
and
his
Shakespeare
class.
Because
Professor
Smith
taught
my
First
Year
Writing
course,
I
am
familiar
with
his
teaching
style
and
the
high
expectations
he
holds
for
his
students.
As
a
student
in
his
class,
I
struggled
with
his
writing
assignments
because
he
often
listed
a
broad
range
of
topics
to
be
discussed
in
only
a
few
pages.
It
is
difficult
for
the
writer
to
find
the
connection
between
each
of
the
topics
and
then
connect
them
sufficiently
in
a
certain
number
of
pages.
As
a
student,
these
writing
assignments
bothered
me,
but
when
I
became
a
Writing
Associate
and
was
asked
to
help
others
tackle
these
difficult
assignments,
I
learned
why
Professor
Smith
asked
his
questions
in
such
a
difficult
manner.
He
requires
his
students
to
be
concise
so
that
their
papers
display
a
firm
grasp
of
the
assignment
without
adding
extraneous
information
that
diverts
the
reader
from
the
topic.
Students
are
forced
to
think
the
paper
topics
through
and
limit
their
writing
to
information
that
is
essential
to
their
thesis.
As
a
Writing
Associate
for
the
Shakespeare
class,
I
was
able
to
discuss
the
assignments
with
his
students
in
order
to
help
them
decide
what
was
essential
to
provide
support
for
their
thesis.
I
feel
that
I
was
able
to
help
these
students,
and
I
now
wish
that
there
was
a
Writing
Associate
for
his
First
Year
Writing
class
in
which
I
was
a
student.
It
is
also
a
positive
experience
working
with
Professor
Smith,
who
always
shows
in
interest
in
my
progress
as
a
student,
a
writer,
and
a
person.
I
face
a
different
challenge
as
a
writer
in
my
accounting
courses.
In
business
classes,
such
as
accounting,
I
do
not
expect
to
receive
many
writing
assignments.
However,
in
my
Auditing
class,
I
was
often
asked
to
write
analyses
of
different
worksheets
that
I
produced.
This
kind
of
writing,
similar
to
lab
reports,
was
a
stark
contrast
to
the
essays
that
I
was
required
to
write
in
other
classes.
These
papers,
replete
with
numbers
interjected
into
the
text,
were
a
bore
to
read.
However,
I
found
that
these
papers,
albeit
lifeless,
were
easy
to
write,
as
they
were
written
almost
mechanically.
They
were
similar
to
any
other
papers
I
have
written,
only,
instead
of
supporting
conclusions
with
words,
conjectures
were
supported
by
numbers
intertwined
throughout
the
text.
One
of
my
biggest
writing
challenges
will
shortly
arrive:
the
law
school
personal
statement.
In
this
statement,
members
of
the
admissions
staff
are
looking
for
not
only
concise
presentation
of
ideas
but
also
a
fresh,
interesting
perspective
on
a
certain
topic.
I
think
that
this
type
of
assignment
is
difficult,
considering
that
you
have
to
show
a
group
of
people
what
an
extraordinary
writer/person
you
are
in
a
page
or
less.
As
it
helps
determine
whether
or
not
you
get
accepted,
the
personal
statement
requires
an
abundance
of
time
and
effort
to
prepare.
After
I
write
my
personal
statement,
I
will
undoubtedly
have
it
reviewed
by
other
Waiting
Associates
and
professors.
Hopefully,
they
can
offer
a
fresh
perspective
when
critiquing
my
writing
and
help
me
as
I
continue
on
the
path
of
education.
A
new
semester
will
bring
a
fresh
group
of
students
with
different
ideas
and
writing
styles.
As
each
new
group
of
students
grow
as
writers,
so
do
I,
and
I
hope
I
am
able
to
help
them
make
the
transition
to
college
writing.
I
also
hope
that
with
more
experience
under
my
belt,
my
writing
(and
grades)
will
improve.
If
I
do
become
a
lawyer,
writing
will
be
an
integral
part
of
my
livelihood
I
am
grateful
that
the
experience
and
training
that
I
have
received
as
a
Writing
Associate
will
be
a
great
benefit
to
me
in
the
future.
