WA
Summer
Assignment
Writing
has
been
an
important
part
of
my
life
beyond
Njust
schoolworkO
since
I
was
very
young.
Inspired
by
the
chapter
books
and
childrenOs
literature
I
was
exposed
to
at
a
young
age,
I
realized
early
on
that
I
wanted
to
incorporate
writing
into
my
life
as
something
more
than
just
a
necessity.
I
wanted
to
work
in
into
my
what
I
did
as
a
living,
whether
as
an
author,
screenwriter,
journalist,
editor,
or
anything
similar,
and
this
goal
has
never
changed
since
I
first
proclaimed
it
sometime
around
first
grade.
Though
I
canOt
remember
very
clearly,
IOm
pretty
sure
I
started
writing
around
the
same
time
I
started
reading.
I
had
just
turned
four,
and
had
about
a
year
before
I
entered
kindergarten.
I
started
writing
NbooksO
that
were
really
no
more
than
captions
on
some
scribbled
drawings
of
family
members
that
I
would
staple
down
the
side.
Almost
every
one
of
my
books
was
the
same:
NThis
is
my
mom.
This
is
my
dad.
This
is
my
sister.
I
love
my
family.O
Sometimes
I
would
throw
in
a
picture
of
a
dog
with
a
plea
that
we
get
one,
or
a
picture
of
Disney
World
with
the
words
NMy
favorite
vacationO
under
it.
Regardless
of
the
low
quality
of
this
work,
it
helped
spark
an
interest
in
reading
and
writing
that
has
carried
over
many
years.
In
first
or
second
grade,
we
started
NWriterOs
WorkshopsO
that
would
encourage
students
to
practice
stringing
words
together
into
sentences.
Sometimes
the
assignments
would
be
writing
about
our
favorite
activities
or
a
family
member;
other
times
we
would
be
allowed
to
write
short
stories
with
a
particular
theme,
such
as
Halloween
or
summer
time.
These
workshops
quickly
became
my
favorite
part
of
any
week,
though
turning
the
story
in
at
the
end
of
the
day
became
a
stressful
event
because
oftentimes
I
felt
my
work
wasnOt
finished.
In
middle
school,
my
grade
became
a
sort
of
guinea
pig
for
a
new
curriculum
that
included
a
class
called
NResearch,O
which
was
supposed
to
teach
students
how
to
write
papers.
I
qualified
for
the
Gifted
and
Talented
version
of
this
program,
and
while
many
of
my
classmates
were
taught
the
proper
ways
to
cite
papers
for
research
projects,
I
just
wrote
papers.
At
this
age,
I
thought
these
were
proper
Nresearch
papers,O
though
a
few
years
later
I
realized
that
I
never
opened
a
book
or
cited
a
website
for
any
of
them.
They
were
all
quite
lengthy
for
that
age
(three
or
four
pages
apiece),
but
they
were
all
opinion
or
informative
pieces
about
things
in
my
own
life,
such
as
the
relationship
between
me
and
my
sister
or
the
significance
of
my
junk
drawer
at
home.
While
my
ability
to
express
myself
through
written
word
increased,
I
still
had
no
idea
how
to
do
research
or
compile
it
into
a
fully
formed
paper.
This
only
changed
in
eighth
grade,
when
I
was
asked
to
write
a
paper
on
how
a
particular
authorOs
life
influenced
his
work.
My
teacher
gave
me
the
two
resources
that
I
was
supposed
to
use
in
the
paper.
My
high
school
required
that
we
write
one
research
paper
for
our
first
three
years
of
school.
Each
one
got
progressively
more
independent
and
complicated.
Our
freshman
year
paper
was
essentially
the
same
paper
we
wrote
in
eighth
grade,
but
we
did
the
research
on
our
own,
but
with
heavily
enforced
guidelines
and
due
dates.
We
had
to
find
a
particular
number
of
sources,
write
an
annotated
bibliography,
write
notecards
breaking
our
paper
into
specific
pieces,
and
finally
hand
in
two
rough
drafts
before
the
final
paper.
The
entire
paper
took
almost
five
months
to
complete.
Sophomore
year
we
were
instructed
to
compare
and
contrast
a
lyricist
to
a
poet,
meaning
we
had
to
do
twice
as
much
research
as
we
did
before,
and
with
half
as
much
help.
While
we
were
once
again
given
a
large
amount
of
time
to
complete
the
paper,
we
were
left
on
our
own
to
do
most
of
the
research,
though
we
still
had
to
hand
in
an
annotated
bibliography
and
a
couple
of
rough
drafts
before
the
final
paper.
The
junior
year
paper
was
similarly
structured,
but
the
topic
could
be
anything
we
wanted.
Senior
year
I
took
the
only
AP
English
class
offered
at
the
high
school,
and
the
way
we
studied
changed
drastically.
Rather
than
write
one
paper
for
the
entire
year,
my
classmates
and
I
found
ourselves
writing
both
essays
and
research
papers
on
the
different
novels
we
read.
It
was
a
much
closer
structure
to
what
IOve
experienced
so
far
in
college.
Outside
of
school,
I
continued
my
adventures
from
the
second
grade
WriterOs
Workshops.
I
consistently
wrote
stories
outside
of
school,
with
my
ultimate
goal
being
to
write
a
novel
one
day.
I
still
have
an
entire
drawer
of
the
stories
IOve
written
from
second
grade
onward.
My
favorite
genre
to
write
in
is
fantasy,
and
while
I
still
want
to
publish
a
novel
(and
completed
a
draft
of
one
my
sophomore
year
of
high
school),
I
realized
at
around
fourteen
that
branching
out
to
short
stories
and,
occasionally,
poetry,
was
enjoyable
and
also
a
generally
good
idea.
In
college,
IOve
written
several
types
of
research
papers,
a
lab
paper,
and
several
creative
writing
assignments.
While
I
felt
that
my
writing
skills
were
what
they
needed
to
be
to
transition
into
college,
I
was
very
nervous
about
being
able
to
do
proper
research
on
my
own.
Luckily
my
FYS
focused
almost
exclusively
on
this
aspect
of
writing
papers,
and
I
was
able
to
gain
a
little
bit
of
confidence
in
this
area.
With
better
research,
writing
papers
became
much
easier,
and
my
writing
became
generally
better
because
of
I
was
able
to
find
and
include
the
information
that
I
really
needed,
rather
than
simply
what
I
was
able
to
find
most
easily.
I
was
also
quickly
introduced
to
several
different
approaches
to
research
papers
and
expected
to
write
them
much
faster
than
I
was
use
to.
I
was
able
to
adjust
to
both
of
these
through
my
FYS,
and
by
my
second
semester
I
felt
I
had
a
comfortable
grip
on
the
concept
of
college
writing
versus
what
I
did
in
high
school.
Although
I
feel
as
though
IOve
reached
a
certain
level
of
comfort
in
college
writing,
I
definitely
feel
there
is
still
room
for
improvement.
I
often
struggle
with
introductions;
many
times
I
find
myself
writing
the
entire
paper
before
going
back
and
adding
the
introduction
to
the
beginning,
only
to
still
be
dissatisfied
by
it.
Conclusions
can
sometimes
be
similarly
frustrating.
The
length
of
my
papers,
whether
too
short
or
too
long,
can
also
be
an
issue;
however,
since
entering
college
IOve
become
better
at
realizing
what
is
necessary
to
a
paper
and
what
isnOt,
as
well
as
learning
where
to
insert
information
and
choose
topics
that
will
fill
the
page
limit
appropriately.
I
also
donOt
always
deal
especially
well
with
criticism,
though
this
applies
more
to
my
creative
writing
than
academic
writing.
While
I
donOt
tend
to
react
poorly
once
the
criticism
is
actually
given,
going
to
get
it
or
receive
it
in
the
first
place
intimidates
me;
so
badly
that
a
large
majority
of
my
work
has
stayed
a
secret
from
my
friends,
and
my
family
has
read
hardly
anything
IOve
written,
creative
or
otherwise.
Even
revising
my
own
work
can
sometimes
be
a
struggle,
though
I
donOt
have
this
problem
when
it
comes
to
othersO
work.
This
also
adds
to
my
difficulty
starting
papers,
as
I
sometimes
let
Nwhat
could
go
wrongO
influence
my
thought
too
much
in
the
beginning
of
the
writing
process.
As
stated
before,
this
fear
applies
especially
to
creative
writing
and
writing
that
I
decide
to
do
outside
of
class,
where
there
is
no
deadline
or
grade
to
accompany
it.
Despite
my
apparent
lack
of
confidence
in
my
own
writing,
I
do
feel
that
I
have
some
strengths
in
certain
areas.
IOve
always
been
able
to
connect
ideas
smoothly
to
one
another
and
notice
when
information
sounds
or
is
irrelevant
to
the
greater
part
of
the
work.
I
tend
to
be
able
to
tell
which
parts
of
an
essay
need
more
substance
behind
them,
and
where
an
additional
topic
could
add
to
the
paper
rather
than
simply
overwhelm
it.
IOve
also
learned
how
to
comb
through
peer
criticism
in
order
to
add
or
take
away
what
would
make
my
paper
better,
rather
than
just
take
everything
in
at
once
in
the
hopes
that
the
quality
of
the
assignment
improves.
Nor
do
I
ignore
criticism,
once
I
have
gotten
it.
Because
IOve
been
writing
inside
and
outside
of
class
for
such
a
long
time,
I
have
many
wonderful
and
many
unpleasant
memories
pertaining
to
the
subject.
One
of
my
favorite
memories
as
a
writer
would
definitely
be
the
day
that
I
finally
finished
the
first
draft
of
the
novel
I
was
working
on
as
a
sophomore.
I
concluded
it
with
just
over
two
hundred
single-spaced
pages,
and
after
over
a
year
of
writing
and
even
more
time
planning,
it
was
just
a
huge
accomplishment
to
have
finally
finished.
Though
I
wasnOt
entirely
pleased
with
the
final
product,
and
immediately
went
back
to
edit
and
eventually
re-start
the
entire
thing,
to
have
a
fully
concluded
story
after
such
a
long
time
felt
great,
even
if
I
didnOt
show
anyone
right
away.
One
of
my
worst
memories
took
place
during
my
sophomore
year
history
class,
in
which
we
were
expected
to
write
an
essay
every
week
on
a
specific
historic
topic
that
related
to
class.
These
essays
were
always
graded
out
of
twenty,
and
had
very
rigid
guidelines
that
we
were
required
to
meet,
including
number
of
paragraphs,
quotes,
and
pages.
No
matter
how
I
wrote
the
essay,
or
on
which
topic
I
wrote,
I
was
never
able
to
get
above
a
seventeen
on
any
one
of
these
essays,
often
scoring
around
a
fourteen
or
fifteen.
While
this
in
itself
was
frustrating,
my
teacher
never
edited
or
marked
up
my
paper
in
any
way
to
indicate
how
I
could
improve.
While
I
tried
to
ask
about
it,
I
never
got
a
good
answer
and
was
left
without
any
idea
how
to
make
the
essays
better.
This
inability
to
learn
from
my
past
mistakes
and
improve
both
my
writing
and
grades
is
still
one
of
the
most
frustrating
experiences
from
my
high
school
career.
In
the
future,
I
really
hope
to
overcome
some
of
my
fear
of
criticism
and
enable
myself
to
more
easily
start
papers
and
other
projects
that
have
to
do
with
writing,
rather
than
talk
myself
out
of
or
procrastinate
on
starting
them.
I
also
hope
to
someday
more
easily
look
over
and
edit
my
own
papers.
Perhaps
with
some
practice
and
instruction
on
how
to
critique
other
peopleOs
writing
constructively,
I
will
be
more
able
to
do
these
things
to
my
own
writing,
and
improve
as
a
writer
in
the
process.
I
want
to
continue
working
across
several
different
forms
of
writing,
whether
in
class
or
in
my
own
free
time,
as
while
I
donOt
enjoy
essay
writing
as
much
as
the
creative
kind,
I
feel
that
itOs
a
necessary
skill,
and
one
in
which
I
could
do
well.
