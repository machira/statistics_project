Literacy
Narrative
8/22/95
I
can
remember
going
to
school
almost
everyday,
sitting
in
class,
and
occasionally
listening
to
the
teacher.
Yet
there
is
no
memory
of
the
lessons
I
learned,
or
the
assignments
I
completed
until
highschool.
Highschool
was
the
first
active
decision
I
made
about
my
education.
Previously,
I
would
just
grow
a
year
older,
and
advance
to
the
next
grade.
But
when
I
turned
fourteen
years
old,
I
decided
to
change
schools.
This
decision
was
the
first
step
to
becoming
interested
in
my
education.
My
awareness
towards
education,
and
my
respect
for
literacy
did
not
occur
immediately.
But
when
I
think
of
my
attitudes
entering
highschool
and
compare
them
with
my
attitudes
entering
college,
they
appear
to
be
thoughts
from
different
people.
Something
gradually
changed
me
over
those
four
years.
It
may
have
been
the
teachers,
or
the
assignments,
or
something
in
the
water,
but
no
matter
what
it
was
I
am
grateful
for
the
change.
My
freshman
English
class
met
everyday
at
three
o'clock,
it
was
the
last
class
of
the
day.
On
Tuesday
and
Thursday
we
were
scheduled
for
grammar
assignments,
yet
our
teacher,
Ms.
Dickerson,
rarely
held
tightly
to
that
schedule.
Ms.
Dickerson
was
a
young
poet
and
author
from
New
York
City
who
always
enjoyed
discussing
the
classics
we
were
reading
instead
of
discussing
grammar
lessons.
But
there
was
a
schedule
she
always
adhered
to,
the
schedule
of
our
paper
assignments.
Every
Monday
afternoon
we
had
to
turn
in
a
3-4
page
paper,
no
exceptions.
This
schedule
resulted
in
many
frustrating,
stressful,
late
Sunday
nights
for
me.
The
typical
routine
began
in
the
afternoon.
Settling
into
a
brown
leather
couch
with
a
pad
of
paper
and
a
pen,
I
would
brainstorm
for
topics
while
watching
the
Giants
game.
After
the
game,
I
would
usually
complain
about
the
assignment
to
anyone
who
would
listen,
not
a
long
list
of
people.
Gradually,
the
paper
would
be
started
and
painfully
completed.
I
was
never
concerned
about
what
I
actually
had
written
or
how
I
had
written
it
My
sole
concern
was
that
the
paper
occupied
three
standard
sized
pages.
I
imagined
all
of
my
classmates
were
engaged
in
identical
Sunday
night
rituals.
One
Monday
afternoon,
I
was
talking
to
a
friend
before
class.
We
were
the
first
people
to
arrive
in
the
classroom,
so
we
were
drawing
all
over
the
blackboard,
and
stuffing
chalk
into
the
erasers.
As
usual,
I
asked
my
friend
how
long
his
paper
turned
out
to
be,
hoping
that
mine
was
not
the
quickest
to
read.
He
sheepishly
responded
that
his
paper
was
five
and
a
half
pages
long.
Incredulous,
I
asked
what
he
possibly
could
have
written
that
much
about,
and
why
he
didn't
end
it
after
four
pages.
I
learned
that
the
paper
was
titled,
"Birth
of
an
Emotion."
My
friend
said
he
had
thought
about
the
idea
of
how
and
why
a
new
emotion
could
develop
and
he
had
wanted
to
write
a
story
about
it,
no
big
deal.
But
it
was
a
big
deal
to
me.
This
story
was
deep.
This
story
was
interesting.
This
story
was
beyond
anything
I
had
ever
thought
about
creating.
At
that
moment,
I
wanted
to
go
home
and
write
a
story
about
the
exact
same
thing,
it
sounded
like
it
could
be
fun.
My
writing
process
was
many
things,
but
it
was
never
fun.
From
that
morning
on,
I
began
to
devote
more
thought
into
the
topics
of
my
papers.
I
wanted
my
topics
to
have
many
layers
of
understanding,
I
yearned
for
metaphors,
I
searched
for
similes.
There
was
a
problem
with
my
new
found
interest
in
creating
engaging
literature,
I
was
not
a
deep
fourteen
year
old.
I
read
the
classics
for
class,
yet
when
I
went
to
compose
my
own,
I
wrote
like
a
freshman.
My
Sunday
night
routine
became
even
more
frustrating
and
tortured.
I
would
now
dismiss
topics
on
the
basis
of
their
quality.
Previously,
I
would
only
reject
a
topic
if
two
pages
was
the
most
I
could
write
about
it
During
my
freshman
year,
I
experienced
a
mild
shock,
the
initial
warning
sign
that
something
in
my
attitude
towards
writing
was
awry.
This
freshman
English
class
did
not
do
much
to
improve
my
skills
at
writing,
rather
it
provoked
a
desire
in
me
to
pursue
those
skills
in
writing.
I
did
begin
to
produce
better
papers,
however
I
realized
that
subject
was
not
the
only
component
to
quality
work.
Sentence
structure,
grammar,
and
organization
were
all
necessary
components
to
writing
that
were
notably
absent
from
my
work.
Luckily
help
was
on
the
way.
In
the
fall
of
my
sophomore
year,
I
was
to
experience
the
writing
semester.
Mrs.
Fasano
led
my
writing
semester.
Her
diminutive
size
concealed
her
devious
intentions.
It
was
bad
enough
that
our
paper
assignments
doubled
and
the
reading
assignments
increased.
But
Mrs.
Fasano
decided
to
take
bad
writing
personally.
Mrs.
Fasano
had
concluded
that
the
best
way
to
improve
writing
skills
was
to
shame
her
students
into
improving.
Copies
of
all
our
papers
were
made
and
distributed
to
the
class.
In
addition,
three
authors
a
day
would
have
the
opportunity
to
read
their
work
to
the
class,
and
then
listen
to
a
critique
and
discussion
about
the
paper.
To
make
matters
worse,
authors
were
not
chosen
to
read
aloud
on
a
volunteer
basis.
The
first
day
of
reading
spared
me,
three
other
classmates
had
the
opportunity
to
share
their
work.
The
next
day
I
was
chosen
to
read
first.
I
was
the
only
author
who
had
the
opportunity
to
read
that
day.
My
paper
was
still
being
critiqued
when
the
bell
rang.
If
she
had
her
way,
Mrs.
Fasano
could
have
continued
all
afternoon.
I
left
that
classroom
never
wanting
to
return.
Later,
after
I
had
thought
about
the
comments
made
about
my
paper,
I
realized
an
important
problem
with
the
way
I
wrote.
I
assumed
that
because
an
idea
was
clear
to
me,
it
would
naturally
be
clear
to
the
reader
as
well.
Any
idea,
or
fragment
of
a
thought
would
be
written
down
without
any
further
explanation.
The
next
day
I
reread
my
paper.
I
more
easily
saw
the
confused
thoughts
and
the
muddled
idea's.
Good
writing
was
important
to
ease
reading,
yet
it
was
necessary
to
convey
the
full
impact
of
any
idea.
The
semester
with
Mrs.
Fasano
scared
me
straight
My
writing
had
been
convicted
by
a
jury
of
my
peers.
Throughout
that
semester
we
wrote
research
papers,
developed
thesis',
and
wrote
creative
pieces.
I
learned
at
the
end
of
freshman
year
that
it
was
important
to
devote
thought
into
choosing
a
topic.
I
learned
throughout
the
fall
of
my
sophomore
year
that
it
was
necessary
to
labor
over
the
style
and
manner
in
which
idea's
are
presented.
The
last
two
years
of
highschool
did
not
contain
anymore
revelations
about
the
writing
process.
Instead,
it
was
a
time
to
practice.
I
wrote
dozens
of
papers
for
English
classes,
term
papers
for
history,
speeches
for
public
speaking
and
student
government,
I
even
had
to
write
essays
in
French.
Writing
was
a
part
of
every
class,
it
was
impossible
to
escape.
My
writing
process
developed
on
my
own.
I
was
not
taught
stages
to
go
through,
such
as
brainstorming,
outlining,
drafts,
revisions
etc.
I
was
taught
what
was
important
and
why
it
was
important
to
a
paper,
and
then
I
was
given
the
freedom
to
develop
a
process
that
fit
my
own
style.
Yet
despite
all
the
independence,
I
was
not
given
the
freedom
to
write
poorly.
But
by
this
point,
I
did
not
give
myself
the
freedom
to
write
poorly.
I
was
not
satisfied
with
undeveloped
topics,
or
unclear
English.
The
nights
that
I
spent
working
before
papers
were
due
did
not
get
any
shorter,
in
fact
they
most
likely
got
longer.
Although
I
got
less
sleep,
the
papers
that
I
was
able
to
submit
fulfilled
both
length
and
quality
requirements.
Graduating
highschool,
I
felt
confident
that
I
had
been
prepared
for
the
level
of
writing
in
college
courses.
I
had
written
papers
for
many
different
classes,
on
many
varied
topics,
and
aimed
at
different
audiences.
When
I
was
assigned
papers
I
no
longer
felt
the
degree
of
dread
that
I
once
had.
Yet
not
fearing
the
writing
process,
was
far
from
enjoying
it.
My
first
year
seminar
did
not
foster
much
love
for
writing.
I
wrote
often
for
that
class,
we
were
assigned
three
long
research
papers
and
three
in-class
essay
tests.
Since
I
was
in
the
engineering
curriculum,
my
seminar
was
the
only
opportunity
I
had
to
write.
Unfortunately
the
topic
of
my
seminar
was
"Revolutions
in
Science,"
and
although
I
enjoyed
the
writing
as
opposed
to
equations,
it
was
another
science
course,
something
my
schedule
was
full
of.
At
the
end
of
my
freshman
year
at
Lafayette,
I
applied
to
transfer.
Although
I
ultimately
decided
to
remain
at
Lafayette,
the
transfer
application
process
marked
the
turning
point
in
attitude
towards
writing.
I
really
enjoyed
writing
the
essay's
for
the
many
different
applications.
The
questions
that
the
universities
asked
were
not
elaborate,
yet
they
were
personal.
Through
answering
questions
about
why
I
wanted
to
transfer,
I
thought
a
lot
about
my
priorities.
Writing
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
express
my
feelings,
and
come
to
conclusions
that
I
was
previously
not
able
to
reach.
I
was
able
to
learn
a
great
deal
about
myself,
and
I
realized
that
writing
did
not
have
to
be
about
distant
topics.
The
last
time
I
wrote
about
feelings
was
during
my
highschool
writing
semester.
At
that
time
I
was
too
frustrated
by
my
deficiency
in
skills
to
be
able
to
enjoy
writing
about
emotion.
After
my
experience
with
transferring,
I
began
to
write
often,
just
for
pleasure.
I
started
to
keep
a
journal,
sporadically
making
entries.
My
journal
has
been
a
creative
way
to
look
at
any
problems
that
I
have,
and
it
often
helps
me
grasp
problems
that
seem
too
large
or
overwhelming.
It
also
has
been
an
outlet
for
any
observations
that
I
think
are
important,
and
deserve
discussion.
Most
importantly,
I
write
and
make
entries
on
an
irregular
basis.
Whenever
I
feel
the
motivation,
or
inspiration
to
write,
I
do.
I
do
not
work
with
any
deadlines,
or
due
dates,
so
I
write
until
my
idea's
are
fully
expressed.
I
am
never
concerned
with
length,
or
with
thesis
development
I
also
have
recently
begun
to
experiment
with
poetry.
When
I
sit
in
some
of
my
engineering
classes,
my
thoughts
sometimes
wander.
I
often
begin
to
write
poetry
in
the
margins
of
my
notes.
I
consider
what
I
write
as
the
equivalent
of
doodling,
a
diversion
from
some
of
the
technical
onslaught
But
this
is
an
important
indication
of
my
changed
attitude.
I
now
regard
writing
as
a
diversion.
I
no
longer
try
to
avoid
it,
agonizing
over
any
assignment
I
look
to
writing
as
a
way
to
relax.
And
with
my
increased
interest
in
writing
has
also
come
an
increased
enjoyment
of
reading.
I
enjoy
looking
at
the
different
styles
of
authors,
and
the
different
approaches
each
has
to
presenting
arguments.
Before
I
became
involved
in
a
technical
field,
I
was
not
able
to
see
the
importance
and
enjoyment
that
could
be
found
from
writing.
