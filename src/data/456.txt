Writing
History
Mrs.
Atkesonus
classroom
was
always
covered
wall
to
wall
with
our
artwork
and
word
lists.
I
sat
down
at
one
of
the
round
wooden
tables
and
began
to
draft
my
first
memorable
story.
It
started
out
like
this:
rI
am
going
bananas,
no
I
am
eating
bananas,
then
I
am
going
peaches,
I
am
eating
peachesis
There
is
no
surprise
to
the
path
this
narrative
continues
on
for
the
next
several
lines.
This
particular
story
sticks
out
in
my
memories
because
it
represents
the
change
that
I
made
between
writing
mostly
thoughtless
stories
and
reading
fantasy
books
to
the
course
that
I
continue
to
follow
of
experimenting
with
my
writing
and
reading
challenging
thought
provoking
literature.
It
is
hard
to
imagine
that
this
big
of
a
change
could
come
about
in
second
grade,
but
the
feedback
I
got
from
the
fruit
piece
made
me
realize
how
much
I
had
underestimated
the
power
of
writing.
The
books
I
began
to
read,
mainly
autobiographies,
contributed
to
my
new
outlook.
I
am
sure
Mrs.
Atkesonus
did
not
expect
that
her
simple
suggestion
to
rbe
more
matures
would
have
such
a
profound
impact
on
my
development
as
a
writer.
From
a
very
early
age,
I
have
been
required
or
encouraged
to
keep
a
writers
notebook.
Its
purpose
was
to
serve
as
a
place
to
do
writing
assignments
as
well
as
a
journal
where
I
could
record
my
thoughts,
stories
or
words
that
I
found
particularly
interesting.
This
was
a
great
way
to
promote
rfree
writings
and
provide
a
consistent
location
to
express
my
thoughts.
In
addition
to
keeping
a
writers
notebook,
I
was
also
taught
to
brainstorm
before
I
began
writing.
If
I
was
writing
a
story
I
would
record
some
ideas
that
could
help
guide
me
along
the
way.
When
I
wrote
poetry
I
would
start
with
a
list
of
words
that
randomly
popped
into
my
head.
The
poem
to
follow
did
not
necessarily
stem
from
those
words,
but
it
always
helped
to
get
me
in
a
writing
mindset
and
clear
my
head.
Throughout
high
school
and
my
freshman
year
of
college
brainstorming
continued
to
facilitate
my
writing.
For
example,
before
I
began
to
write
this
essay,
I
recorded
a
list
of
topics
to
include
such
as
poetry,
word
banks,
cursive,
and
Mr.
Virrill.
In
addition
to
writers
notebooks,
I
had
to
keep
a
readers
book
log
in
every
grade.
This
contained
the
names
and
authors
of
all
the
books
I
read
and
additional
information
that
changed
as
I
advanced
through
my
school.
My
book
log
for
second
grade
includes
a
column
entitled,
ryummy
wordss
and
in
it
I
recorded
all
of
the
words
that
stood
out
to
me
when
I
was
reading
a
particular
book
such
as:
rsparkling,
dashing,
murky.s
In
subsequent
grades
I
had
to
record
full
book
descriptions
or
short
summaries
which
included;
why
I
liked
or
did
not
like
it,
and
who
I
would
recommend
it
to.
These
book
treviewsu
were
a
great
tool
to
help
express
my
thoughts
about
literature
in
an
organized
concise
fashion.
They
also
assisted
me
in
formulating
the
type
of
writing
style
and
technique
I
have
developed
by
forcing
me
to
think
about
other
authors
writing
and
why
they
were
or
were
not
appealing
to
me.
Another
tool
that
helped
me
develop
a
writing
style
was
poetry.
After
emerging
from
the
rrhyming
stages
and
nature
grounded
poems
of
elementary
school,
my
poems
became
a
means
of
expressing
my
emotions.
As
mentioned
earlier,
I
would
always
start
with
a
free
brainstorm
to
clear
my
head.
My
poem
topics
ranged
from
being
the
middle
child
to
loosing
a
loved
one.
In
eighth
grade
I
had
one
of
my
poems
published
in
an
anthology
of
poetry.
I
wrote
the
poem
after
visiting
the
Holocaust
Memorial
Museum
in
Washington
D.C.
It
contained
words
and
images
that
stood
out
as
I
walked
through
the
exhibits.
Even
though
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
I
read
that
poem
or
visited
the
museum,
I
can
still
remember
many
of
the
lines
from
the
poem
and
the
images
from
the
museum
that
accompany
them.
I
wrote
about
the
pile
of
burnt
shoes
and
the
half
bowl
of
soup
rations
that
were
given
to
the
prisoners
of
concentration
camps.
rNocturnal
silences
read
the
last
words
of
the
poem.
I
had
seen
it
written
on
the
wall
as
a
description
of
the
noise
made
by
inmates
who
had
just
lost
their
friends
and
families
to
the
gas
chambers.
Poetry
allowed
me
to
express
my
opinions
in
a
creative
way
that
was
not
restricted
by
facts
and
grammar.
With
the
exception
of
poetry,
I
did
not
do
much
rcreatives
writing
in
elementary
schooliat
least
none
that
I
can
remember.
My
first
exposure
and
success
with
creative
writing
came
at
the
end
of
seventh
grade
when
I
had
to
write
an
uncontested
election
speech
to
become
the
elementary
school
community
service
coordinator.
Because
I
had
no
opponent,
there
was
no
need
to
prove
why
I
would
be
the
better
candidate
for
the
position.
Therefore
the
rif
you
elect
mes
or
rif
electeds
rhetoric
used
in
most
every
speech
for
other
positions
was
of
no
help
to
me.
My
speech
was
different.
I
started
out
with
the
visual
image
of
the
first
time
I
performed
community
service.
I
asked
the
audience
to
shut
their
eyes
and
I
took
them
through
my
experience
as
if
it
were
their
own.
The
positive
feedback
I
received
from
teachers
and
peers
after
the
assembly,
along
with
the
ease
of
which
I
wrote
the
speech,
made
me
realize
the
power
of
creative
writing
as
well
as
my
strengths
for
it.
Although
my
creative
writing
skills
were
not
put
to
use
again
until
high
school,
the
speech
gave
me
insight
into
my
forte
as
a
writer.
When
I
first
began
writing,
using
a
word
processor
on
the
computer
was
not
common.
Assignments
were
always
written
in
cursive
from
the
end
of
second
grade
on,
and
free
writing
was
done
in
pencil
on
lined
paper.
I
eventually
got
into
the
habit
of
handwriting
almost
everything
until
the
final
draft.
I
felt
that
computers
were
impersonal
and
inhibited
my
creativity
when
I
was
brainstorming.
I
liked
the
idea
of
keeping
my
thoughts
and
rough
drafts
in
notebooks,
which
I
learned
to
trust
over
the
years.
When
I
would
stare
at
a
blank
computer
screen
with
no
handwritten
work
in
front
of
me,
my
thoughts
would
disappear
or
words
would
not
flow
together.
To
this
day,
I
prefer
to
start
out
with
paper
and
pen
or
pencil.
I
rarely
write
in
cursive
because
it
is
another
factor
that
I
have
to
think
about
when
the
goal
of
brainstorming
is
simply
to
get
my
thoughts
on
to
paper
and
generate
ideas.
Most
frequently,
I
will
write
a
few
paragraphs
on
paper,
or
even
an
entire
rough
draft
on
paper.
It
not
only
helps
me
to
express
my
ideas
better,
but
when
I
re
type
what
I
have
written,
the
first
typed
copy
becomes
my
first
revision.
I
have
learned
the
importance
of
the
editing
and
revision
process
from
many
helpful
teachers.
There
have
been
many
teachers
who
helped
me
grow
and
develop
my
own
style
of
writing.
A
particular
comment,
which
I
received
from
my
10th
grade
English
teacher,
Mr.
Virrill,
still
comes
to
my
mind
every
time
I
sit
down
to
write.
On
an
essay
about
decision-making,
he
wrote
rshow,
donut
tells
in
the
margin.
My
paper
revolved
around
the
decision
to
participate
in
an
emersion
program
in
Costa
Rica
with
my
Spanish
class
during
spring
break,
or
relax
and
stay
with
my
friends
and
family.
Initially,
I
simply
stated
that
I
could
not
decide
between
the
two
options
and
eventually
picked
the
trip.
In
a
written
revision,
I
reworded
my
paper
to
read:
rI
glanced
at
the
picture
of
my
friends
resting
on
my
dresser,
I
gazed
down
at
the
emersion
program
forms.
Slowly,
I
walked
over
to
my
dresser,
grabbed
the
framed
photograph,
took
two
quick
steps
toward
my
bed
and
hid
it
under
my
pillow.s
I
used
other
words
to
describe
how
I
was
feeling
(nervous)
and
show
that
I
was
really
torn
by
my
decision
and
the
consequences
it
could
have
(a
potentially
bad
spring
breakior
regret
at
having
passed
up
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime).
In
addition
to
helping
me
with
my
creative
writing,
Mr.
Virrill
helped
me
complete
my
first
lengthy
research
paper.
The
tenth
grade
research
paper
topic
could
be
anything
we
were
interested
in.
I
chose
the
ethics
of
photojournalism.
The
process
took
place
over
several
weeks,
and
included
different
stages
such
a
research,
drafting,
peer
editing
and
revision.
We
were
taught
how
to
properly
use
note
cards
to
organize
the
facts
and
ideas
and
keep
track
of
which
sources
they
came
from.
We
had
to
include
in
text
citations
and
a
proper
list
of
citations
in
MLA
format
at
the
end.
Documenting
sources
and
making
citations
was
nothing
new
to
me,
but
the
fifteen
written
pages
and
extensive
research
was.
In
addition
we
had
deadlines
to
turn
in
various
parts
of
our
research
such
as
an
outline.
The
outline
was
expected
to
be
extremely
detailed
and
include
almost
all
of
our
ideas.
I
learned
many
facts
about
organization
and
source
checking
through
the
research
paper
and
it
is
one
of
the
main
elements
that
gave
me
confidence
for
college
writing.
The
following
year
I
was
able
to
experience
a
new
form
of
writing
I
was
not
familiar
with:
monologues.
The
class
was
called
rPage
to
Stages
and
we
read
many
plays
and
wrote
and
recited
many
monologues.
I
loved
writing
monologues
because
it
gave
me
a
completely
new
perspective
from
which
to
write.
I
went
through
many
changes
my
junior
year
and
was
able
to
express
my
emotions
through
different
characters.
In
this
way,
writing
became
a
form
of
therapy.
I
could
work
out
an
issue
by
writing
a
monologue
from
my
perspective,
and
then
writing
another
one
from,
for
example,
my
motherus
perspective.
One
of
the
primary
things
to
be
considered
when
writing
a
monologue
is
who
the
audience
is.
It
could
be
the
mirror,
a
friend,
parent
or
stranger.
Monologues
revolve
around
the
audience.
What
is
said
in
a
monologue
depends
on
who
the
audience
is.
Knowing
the
audience
is
an
important
element
to
all
writing,
and
I
first
felt
its
impact
my
junior
year.
The
other
lesson
I
learned
from
writing
monologues
is
how
important
it
is
to
view
issues
from
more
than
one
perspective.
This
applies
to
rnon
creatives
work
as
well,
as
it
is
crucial
to
identify
and
explain
the
weakness
in
an
argument
or
thesis.
The
major
problem
I
have
encountered
with
writing
from
an
early
age
on,
like
many
writers,
is
writers
block.
This
can
happen
to
me
at
any
time
without
warning,
and
when
it
does,
there
is
no
point
in
trying
to
write.
I
have
noticed
that
I
am
more
susceptible
to
writers
block
when
I
have
too
much
on
my
mind,
or
when
I
am
frustrated
about
something.
When
I
get
it,
words
do
not
flow
out
of
my
brain
they
way
they
should,
and
my
thoughts
are
disconnected
and
fragmented.
Some
remedies
I
have
tried
are
doing
a
free
word
flow
where
I
write
down
any
word
that
comes
to
my
mind,
taking
a
nap,
or
just
putting
the
assignment
off.
None
of
these
are
great
solutions,
which
is
why
starting
an
assignment
at
the
last
minute
is
not
an
option
for
me.
My
freshman
year
writing
experience
was
not
what
I
expected.
I
was
well
prepared
in
the
sense
that
high
expectations
were
set
for
me
in
high
school,
whether
it
concerned
citing
sources
or
revisions.
However,
I
did
not
learn,
as
I
expected
to,
many
new
writing
skills
in
my
First
Year
Seminar.
My
first
college
paper
was
in
Introduction
to
International
Politics.
This
was
a
terrible
first
experience
because
not
only
was
I
unfamiliar
with
my
topic
and
how
to
research
it
but
the
five
page
paper
had
to
be
completed
with
two
other
sophomores
in
the
class.
This
was
extremely
intimidating
because
my
peers
not
only
had
much
more
experience
than
I
did,
but
I
did
not
feel
that
I
was
in
a
position
to
use
the
discourse
that
was
expected
of
me.
And
the
truth
is,
this
was
not
simply
a
feeling.
I
was
not
in
the
rposition
of
privilege.s
I
was
aware
that
my
writing
would
not
be
adequate.
I
was
aware
that
there
was
a
specific
dialect
expected
of
me
that
I
was
not
prepared
to
use.
As
it
is
explained
in
r
Inventing
the
Universitys
by
David
Bartholomae,
students,
when
writing
for
teachers
rhave
to
assume
privilege
without
having
any.
And
since
students
assume
privilege
by
locating
themselves
within
the
discourse
of
a
particular
community...
learningibecomes
more
a
matter
of
imitation
or
parody
than
a
matter
of
invention
and
discovery
(page
448).
Bartholomae
is
saying
that
students
must
pretend
that
they
have
the
authority
and
ability
to
write
in
the
dialect
that
is
expected
of
a
person
in
the
particular
community
and
they
normally
do
so
by
imitating
another
member
of
this
community.
Because
of
my
writing
experience
in
high
school,
I
was
aware
that
the
audience
I
was
writing
for
was
an
important
factor
to
consider
before
writing
the
paper.
The
problem,
in
this
case,
was
that
I
had
identified
the
audience
but
did
not
have
the
skills
to
cater
to
his
needs.
My
contribution
to
the
paper
was
limited
and
weak.
However
once
it
was
handed
back,
I
kept
the
final
copy
and
studied
the
language
my
peers
used
in
writing
their
portions
of
the
paper,
as
well
as
the
feedback
given
by
the
teacher.
This
helped
me
develop
the
position
of
privilege
that
I
used
for
future
writing
assignment
for
the
class.
It
is
clear
that
there
are
many
factors
that
have
contributed
to
my
development
as
a
writer.
In
the
future,
I
hope
to
be
able
to
gain
confidence
in
my
ability
to
invent
and
discover
the
expected
discourse
in
the
Foreign
Language
department
as
well
as
the
Government
and
Law
department
instead
of
simply
imitating
it.
