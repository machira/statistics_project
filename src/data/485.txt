WA
Workshop
Project
The
Writing
Hike:
Forging
my
own
Identity
Imagine
taking
a
long
hike
through
the
woods
and
up
a
mountain.
You
start
off
strong,
because,
of
course,
the
ground
is
relatively
flat.
You
havenOt
reached
the
giant
log
you
need
to
climb
over,
the
muddy
creek
with
the
murky
and
most
likely
infested
waters,
or
the
poison
ivy-covered
vines
that
you
will
inevitably
run
into
without
realizing
it.
(My
summer
job
this
year
was
a
camp
counselor;
I
spent
much
of
my
time
running
into
these
poison
ivy
covered
vines.)
And
so,
with
all
of
the
time
to
think
while
observing
the
outdoors,
IOve
formed
a
parallel
to
the
many
hikes
IOve
taken
with
my
writing
history
during
the
past
year.
Although
the
mountain
steady
yet
gradually
inclines,
there
are
points
in
the
journey
that
seem
flat
and
effortless,
yet
other
places
that
are
difficult,
yet
beneficial
in
providing
much
needed
experience
for
the
remainder
of
the
trip.
And,
there
is
no
point
during
the
hike
where
it
seems
successful
progress
has
been
made.
ItOs
only
by
stepping
back
and
observing
the
mountain
as
a
whole
that
one
sees
the
extent
of
the
hard
work
and
vigor,
and
the
height
to
which
he
climbed.
This
is
my
story
of
a
generally
flat
literary
hike,
with
only
a
few
bumps
in
the
road.
These
hiking
roadblocks,
however,
served
significantly
in
shaping
me
as
both
a
reader
and
a
writer.
During
the
past
two
semesters
at
Lafayette,
2004-05,
my
writing--its
style,
the
ease,
and
the
convention
with
which
I
had
for
so
long
clung
to--was
challenged.
Challenged
by
professors,
by
peers,
and
significantly
by
my
role
as
a
WA,
experiences
this
past
year
served
to
push
me
out
of
my
writing
comfort
bubble.
The
time
had
come
for
me
to
develop
my
individuality
as
a
writer.
There
were
two
significant
roles
I
myself
in
throughout
the
year:
A
Writing
Associate
and
a
student.
However,
there
were
three
major
eras
throughout
this
past
year
in
which
I
struggled,
learned,
and
developed
as
a
writer--the
first
was
a
class,
the
second
was
my
role
as
a
WA,
the
third
was
an
assignment.
Let
the
hike
begin.
11:00
am,
August
31.
I
walked
into
Pardee
103,
and
came
face
to
face
with
the
man
who
IOd
be
learning
from
for
6
hours
a
week
for
the
next
4
months:
Paul
Cefalu.
Expecting
some
big
burly
man
with
grayer
hair
and
a
large
briefcase,
I
was
somewhat
surprised
to
find
Professor
Cefalu
to
be
smaller,
younger,
and
carrying
not
a
briefcase,
but
a
water
bottle
and
a
stack
load
of
papers.
You
see,
Literary
Questions
with
Prof.
Cefalu
was
the
first
200
level
English
course
I
had
ever
enrolled
in.
I
was
about
to
embark
on
a
literary
adventure!
My
seatbelt
was
fastened,
my
pencil
was
poised,
ready
to
start
the
note-taking;
I
was
just
waiting
for
my
driver,
Paul
Cefalu,
to
climb
into
the
vehicle
and
start
the
engine.
Fortunately
for
me
and
for
my
writing
future,
that
never
happened.
You
see,
Professor
Cefalu
assigned
papers
with
limited
guidelines.
There
was
no
hand
holding
through
this
class.
We
were
given
reading
material
and
various
literary
perspectives
through
which
literature
can
be
analyzed.
I
was
expected
to
formulate
not
just
a
thesis,
but
an
engaging
topic
with
presentable
evidence.
Not
to
mention
that
when
it
came
time
to
choose
my
topic,
we
had
already
read
about
eight
novels
and
15
essays.
Talk
about
choices.
This
experience
was
crucial
for
my
development
as
a
writer.
It
forced
me
to
take
in
massive
amounts
of
information
and
organize
it
in
a
way
that
the
readings
complimented
and
supported
each
other
and
my
conclusions
remained
consistent
for
each
novel.
My
experience
in
Professor
CefaluOs
class
taught
me
two
significant
lessons.
First
I
learned
the
various
literary
perspectives
from
which
I
could
analyze
a
piece
of
literature.
This
opened
up
an
entirely
new
world
of
analysis
for
me,
allowing
me
to
draw
conclusions
from
my
reading
that
I
never
would
have
realized
otherwise.
Also,
because
differing
conclusions
can
be
drawn
from
the
same
text
yet
with
two
different
schools
of
thought,
this
class
emphasized
the
validity
of
conclusion
as
long
as
there
is
a
basis
of
textual
evidence.
Relating
this
to
my
Writing
Associate
position,
when
it
comes
to
the
necessity
of
evidence
for
an
argument,
there
is
no
NindividualityO
among
writers.
All
writers
have
the
same
requirementNto
prove
their
thesis
with
textual
support.
Too
often
itOs
easy
to
judge
the
need
for
textual
support
of
the
quality
of
the
thesis
statement,
and
thus
the
ability
of
the
writer
in
question.
However,
regardless
of
the
NreasonableO
or
the
absurdity
of
any
one
thesis
statement,
all
writers
have
an
obligation
to
provide
sufficient
evidence
for
their
conclusions.
Being
in
Professor
CefaluOs
class
also
helped
me
to
organize
large
amounts
of
information
and
draw
a
specific
thesis
from
both
the
material
and
literary
perspectives
given.
Everyone
has
heard
the
phrase,
Nquantity,
not
quality.O
When
it
came
to
my
role
as
a
WA,
this
experience
gave
me
a
much
clearer
opportunity
for
application
of
this
principle.
Too
often,
a
writer
would
come
into
a
conference
with
a
mass
of
information
about
their
topic,
which
may
or
may
not
have
been
organized.
The
result?
Typically,
their
papers
consisted
of
confusing
or
over
explained
logic,
(sometimes
unexplained!)
often
rapid
topic
changes,
and
more
than
likely
quite
a
few
pages
exceeding
what
the
length
that
the
professor
had
specified.
IOve
been
able
to
more
readily
recognize
when
and
where
this
is
a
problem
in
student
writing,
and
work
with
the
student
to
narrow
their
thesis
or
develop
a
more
specific
and
focused
paper.
It
has
only
been
because
of
my
experiences
in
classes
where
I
have
needed
to
narrow
my
own
theses
that
I
can
assist
other
students
in
doing
the
same.
The
second
major
NroadblockO
in
my
writing
came
in
the
form
of
my
role
as
a
Writing
Associate.
Even
though
I
had
done
much
writing
of
my
own,
had
conferences
with
WAs
myself,
and
been
through
the
WA
orientation,
I
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
or
what
I
would
encounter
in
my
conferences.
Mostly,
I
was
unprepared
for
how
the
students
themselves
would
view
me
and
my
role
as
their
Writing
Associate.
I
had
read
the
writing
of
other
students
before,
and
I
had
conferenced
with
other
peers
about
my
own
writing.
And
even
though
my
role
as
a
WA
was
one
of
an
intelligent
reader--a
student
on
the
same
level
as
her
peers
with
the
task
of
engaging
them
in
discussion
about
their
work--this
was
certainly
not
always
the
perception
that
the
students
had
of
me
as
their
WA.
I
encountered
this
especially
in
my
first
semesterOs
FYS
class.
Conference
after
conference,
students
would
come
to
me
expecting
me
to
NfixO
their
papers,
both
with
regard
to
content,
style,
and
mechanics,
to
know
their
arguments
and
understand
their
content.
I
was
not
prepared
to
take
on
that
sort
of
omniscient
role.
So,
for
the
first
semester,
it
was
much
easier
to
try
my
best
to
meet
their
expectations
and
conform
to
their
perception
of
a
Writing
Associate
that
it
was
to
challenge
their
view
of
my
position.
This
often
meant
that
I
did
much
of
the
talking
during
a
conference,
more
or
less
explaining
how
to
NfixO
their
papers.
On
a
few
occasions,
there
were
some
personal
established
mannerisms
in
my
writing
that
I
would
suggest,
and
my
students
would
either
question
them,
or
flat
out
disagree
with
them.
This
required
me
to
humbly
take
a
step
back
and
acknowledge
their
viewpoints,
then
work
with
the
students
to
strengthen
their
papers.
After
all,
as
a
WA,
my
role
is
to
challenge
them
and
point
them
in
the
right
direction
on
their
personal
writing
hike,
not
to
give
then
a
piggy-back
ride
up
my
own.
Finally,
friends,
we
have
come
to
the
third
and
final
of
the
major
Nhiking
hindrancesO
that
I
have
encountered
over
the
past
two
semesters.
Enter
professor
#2...Mrs.
Lee
Upton.
She
would
challenge,
reform,
and
rock
the
socks
of
my
writing
style
before
the
semester
was
over.
(Who
would
have
guessed
from
a
course
on
the
Modern
British
Novel?)
My
writing,
although
it
had
improved
drastically
since
the
end
of
my
high
school
days,
might
still
be
considered
NformulaicO
by
some.
I
switched
between
two
very
different
styles,
or
often
combined
the
two,
a
professional
tone,
and
a
journalistic
(and
more
lighthearted
and
comedic)
tone.
I
didnOt
give
too
much
attention
to
style,
but
focused
much
of
my
attention
on
content-having
a
strong
and
precise
thesis,
reasonable
evidence
and
some
inventive
yet
compelling
discovery.
Unlike
some
of
my
high
school
teachers
and
other
college
professors,
Professor
Upton
wasnOt
looking
for
the
NanswerO
in
my
writing.
Her
assignments
were
designed
as
an
opportunity
to
be
creative,
inventive,
to
develop
a
strong
and
supported
thesis,
while
drawing
larger
conclusions
based
on
historical
implications.
Like
Professor
CefaluOs
class,
this
Modern
British
Novel
course
helped
me
absorb
and
organize
large
amounts
of
reading.
Yet,
different
from
my
Literary
Questions
class,
I
was
to
approach
the
material
in
an
entirely
new
and
creative
manner.
My
assignment:
rewrite
the
endings
to
several
novels
mimicking
the
styles
of
various
authors.
I
sat
on
my
bed,
pen
poised
about
my
paper,
with
no
idea
what
to
write.
Imitate
Virginia
Woolf?
And
D.H.
Lawrence?
I
had
barely
carved
out
a
style
of
my
own,
let
alone
attempt
to
switch
completely
and
mimic
the
styles
and
key
obsessions
of
a
writer
whose
work
was
foreign
to
me!
After
about
fifteen
minutes
worth
of
sitting
there
with
not
so
much
as
a
word
on
the
paper,
(although
a
few
nice
doodles
here
and
there,)
I
finally
got
the
novel
idea
that
in
order
to
write
in
a
certain
style,
I
had
to
become
acquainted
with
that
particular
style.
So,
I
began
to
read.
And
then
I
read
more.
And
more.
Pretty
soon,
I
became
accustomed
to
rhetoric
and
stylistic
mannerisms
of
each
author.
By
placing
myself
in
the
mind
of
each
character
within
the
novel,
I
could
much
more
readily
understand
and
then
reproduce
the
key
thematic
elements
and
obsessions
that
were
familiar
to
the
novelOs
characters.
So,
I
finished
the
assignment,
having
the
unique
opportunity
to
enter
the
minds
and
mimic
some
of
BritainOs
most
well
known
authors.
But,
the
typical
writing
assignment
as
a
writer
OR
an
experienced
reader
does
not
require
this.
So
what
did
I
learn
from
that
experience
that
I
took
with
me
and
could
draw
from
in
my
other
writing
and
reading?
Mimicking
the
styles
of
other
writers
has
helped
me
adapt
to
more
subtlety
different
styles
that
I
may
encounter
as
a
WA.
It
has
taught
me
the
importance
of
stylistic
consistency
within
a
piece
of
writing,
therefore
making
me
more
conscious
of
stylistic
inconsistency
within
a
paper.
This
will
prove
especially
beneficial
when
working
with
more
experienced
or
talented
writers
in
my
WA
assignment
class,
writers
who
do
not
need
focused
time
on
thesis
work,
paper
structure,
etc.
In
these
conferences,
I
can
focus
much
more
of
my
attention
of
their
stylistic
choices,
encouraging
them
to
develop
and
enhance
these
choices
as
a
means
to
add
intangible
content
and
depth
to
their
work,
while
pointing
out
stylistics
incongruence.
With
all
of
my
major
and
minor
bumps
on
my
writing
hike,
I
havenOt
even
come
close
to
reaching
the
end.
But,
because
of
my
experiences
in
writing
and
as
a
WA
this
past
year,
there
are
certain
things
that
learned
and
I
would
do
differently
as
a
WA
this
coming
semester,
and
specific
suggestions
that
I
would
give
to
future
Writing
Associates.
In
fact,
it
can
be
summed
up
in
one
sentence,
having
several
implications
for
oneOs
WA
job:
consistently
recognize
yourself
as
a
growing
and
developing
writer.
As
a
WA,
my
students
will
often
have
experiences
in
writing
or
reading
that
I
have
not.
Other
WAs
will
certainly
have
had
experiences
that
I
have
not.
Therefore,
my
writing
and
my
advice
is
never
the
be-all,
end-all.
I
shouldnOt
be
afraid
to
learn
from
the
students
that
IOm
conferencing
with:
their
styles,
organizational
techniques,
and
their
tone.
There
are
several
times
in
the
past
year
when
I
have
used
techniques
that
one
of
my
students
introduced
to
me.
Also,
I
shouldnOt
be
afraid
to
ask
other
WAOs
for
adviceNwe
are
certainly
all
there
to
do
a
job,
but
part
of
that
job
is
to
help,
support,
and
encourage
each
other,
since
weOre
all
at
different
stages
in
our
writing.
The
second
most
important
implication
I
have
learned
from
my
experiences:
because
all
writers
are
continuing
and
growing
learners,
a
WA
should
not
be
afraid
to
change
the
advice
that
was
once
given
out,
whether
it
was
in
years
passed,
conferences
passed,
or
even
during
the
same
conference.
WeOll
all
make
mistakes;
itOs
all
about
failing
in
the
right
direction.
Take
advantage
of
the
experiences
that
may
appear
to
be
difficult
NhindrancesO
to
your
writing
ease,
for
it
is
those
experiences
that
teach
us
and
mold
us
the
most
into
a
more
developed
and
inimitable
writer.
