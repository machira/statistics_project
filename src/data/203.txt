My
history
as
a
writer
greatly
parallels
my
experiences
as
a
thinking
person.
Both
as
a
young
writer
and
a
young
child,
"me"
was
the
main
focus
of
my
life
and
my
writing.
But
as
a
child
grows,
she
begins
to
notice
the
rest
of
the
world.
Similarly,
as
I
grew
as
a
writer,
I
began
to
report
on
topics
that
interested
me,
encyclopedia-type
stuff.
Children,
until
they
can
think
for
themselves
are
given
rules,
but
never
encouraged
to
bend
or
break
them.
For
a
writer,
these
rules
are
grammar.
Now
as
an
adult
and
an
experienced
writer,
rules
have
softened
to
guidelines,
and
I
decide
which
ones
to
respect
under
the
particular
circumstances.
Writing
is
another
way
of
communicating,
but
also
of
experiencing
life.
So,
it
comes
as
no
surprise
to
me,
that
I
have
gone
through
the
same
stages
as
a
writer
that
I
have
gone
through
as
a
person.
My
first
memories
of
writing
are
from
Pre-Kindergarten,
not
quite
pre-school,
not
quite
kindergarten;
I
think
that
they
may
have
done
away
with
the
term
due
to
confusion.
I
always
wrote
the
letter
"s"
backwards.
And,
when
that
letter
is
in
your
own
name
,
that
can
become
very
frustrating.
I
learned
to
totally
avoid
writing
that
letter.
It
was
very
embarrassing
to
be
the
only
kid
in
the
class
that
needed
the
teacher
to
write
her
name
on
her
fingerpaintings
and
the
like.
I
still
cringe
when
I
picture
those
convoluted
s's.
By
first
grade,
I
had
mastered
writing
the
alphabet
and
had
even
progressed
to
writing
"stories."
These
stories
consisted
of
many
interesting
facts:
have
brown
hair.
I
have
a
dog.
I
like
my
dog.
I
have
a
sister.
We
play
dolls.
Always
accompanying
the
stories
were
pictures.
One
without
the
other
was
like
the
broken
Rosetta
stone.
Since
I
was
just
learning
to
express
myself
in
writing,
I
wrote
about
what
I
knew,
me
and
my
family,
and
I
wrote
in
a
similar
manner
as
I
spoke.
In
second
and
third
grade,
book
reports
composed
the
majority
of
my
writing.
Looking
back,
I
realize
how
beneficial
this
was.
Even
at
a
young
age,
we
were
being
shown
the
connection
between
reading
and
writing.
Writing
well
goes
hand
in
hand
with
reading
a
lot.
It
was
also
at
this
time
that
I
had
my
first
"professional"
success
as
a
writer.
Every
year,
our
school
had
a
read-a-thon
to
raise
money
for
researching
a
cure
for
Multiple
Sclerosis.
Family
and
friends
would
agree
to
sponsor
you
and
for
each
book
you
read,
they
would
give
you
money.
I
knew
little
about
MS,
but
prizes
were
awarded
to
the
kids
who
raised
the
most
money.
I
thought
that
I
could
get
an
edge
on
the
competition
by
writing
my
own
stories,
then
reading
them,
then
counting
each
one
as
a
book.
I
remember
recording
the
book
"Black
Cat"
by
Flamm.
To
convince
myself
that
I
was
not
cheating,
I
emphasized
that
the
read-a-thon
never
specified
what
kind
of
books
counted.
Fourth
grade
was
a
big
year.
I
was
allowed
to
wear
a
kilt
instead
of
a
jumper
and
the
teachers
told
us
to
start
writing
in
pen,
erasable
of
course.
Instead
of
book
reports,
we
began
doing
written
projects
using
the
encyclopedia.
The
only
people
that
I
know
of
with
current
encyclopedia
sets
are
families
with
children
in
elementary
school
or
junior
high.
Isn't
there
any
other
use
for
them?
Under
the
direction
of
my
language
arts
teacher,
Mrs.
Daft,
I
began
to
hone
my
skills
in
creative
writing.
She
emphasized
the
power
of
descriptive
adjectives.
One
project
was
to
describe
a
pair
of
shoes
that
I
owned.
I
chose
the
mucky
boots
that
I
used
to
wear
while
walking
around
the
barn
and
the
horses.
I
was
very
proud
of
the
paragraph
that
I
wrote
and
was
shocked
when
Mrs.
Daft
handed
it
back
and
told
me
to
redo
it.
With
her
guidance
I
wrote
a
better
paragraph
describing
those
"crusty
clodhoppers."
We
even
referred
to
horse
poop
as
"meadow
muffins."
Truthfully,
the
end
product
was
much
more
exciting
than
my
actual
boots.
But,
the
experience
taught
me
that
combining
description
with
exaggeration
can
make
for
more
interesting
writing.
In
fifth
grade,
my
mother
gave
me
a
journal.
The
timing
coincided
with
my
discovery
of
boys.
I
fervently
recorded
my
daily
activities.
"I
think
that
Kevin
Nolen
likes
me
because
he
hit
me
the
hardest
in
dodgeball."
I
made
lists
of
the
things
that
I
liked,
Kevin
Nolen,
New
Kids
on
the
Block,
my
best
girlfriend
of
the
week;
and
the
things
that
I
didn't,
Mrs.
Miller,
Kevin
Nolen,
doing
the
dishes.
The
lists
were
always
being
updated
from
week
to
week.
Hitting
puberty
makes
everything
confusing,
and
my
journal
helped
me
try
to
formalize
my
thoughts
and
desires.
One
day
I
came
home
and
saw
my
journal
sitting
out.
My
older
cousin
had
read
it
and
even
added
her
own
page
mimicking
the
pages
that
I
had
written.
I
was
so
embarrassed
that
even
to
this
day
I
am
paranoid
about
keeping
a
journal.
Recording
your
innermost
thoughts
is
an
amazingly
therapeutic
thing,
but
for
me,
the
risk
of
someone
reading
it
outweighs
the
benefits
of
keeping
a
journal.
At
least
until
I
discover
a
hiding
spot
that
is
undiscoverable
to
all
else.
In
sixth
grade,
I
wrote
my
first
research
paper.
It
was
a
semester
long
project
and
I
chose
AIDS
as
my
topic.
I
searched
newspapers
and
magazines
for
any
articles
pertaining
to
AIDS.
I
even
took
out
medical
books
from
the
Chestnut
Hill
College
Library.
My
teacher
mapped
out
a
process
to
walk
us
through
the
job
of
writing
a
research
paper.
All
of
our
research
was
to
be
written
on
index
cards.
Next
we
arranged
the
information
into
a
outline.
Finally,
we
were
able
to
write
the
paper.
Although
I
found
the
process
rather
tedious,
I
really
enjoyed
writing
a
paper
from
research
that
I
gathered.
In
the
first
week
of
seventh
grade,
my
language
arts
teacher
handed
us
all
packets
about
one
inch
thick.
Quickly,
I
learned
to
dread
the
site
of
this
"diagramming
packet
"
My
ruler
aided
me
in
drawing
line
after
line
after
line.
The
pages
of
the
packet
were
ordered
so
that
they
progressed
in
difficulty.
Subjects,
verbs,
prepositional
phrase,
direct
objects,
indirect
object.
Never
again
would
I
view
a
sentence
simply
as
a
group
of
words
that
make
a
complete
thought.
In
my
sophomore
year
of
college,
my
advanced
writing
class
worked
a
good
deal
on
"grammar."
In
trying
to
determine
subjects
and
predicates,
I
would
often
find
myself
unknowingly
diagramming
the
sentence
in
my
head.
In
my
eighth
grade
music
class
we
practiced
singing
the
National
Anthem.
The
line
that
prompted
the
most
mistakes
was
"O'er
the
ramparts
we
watched..."
Nobody
knew
what
ramparts
were,
or
what
language
"o'er"
was.
Our
teacher
explained
that
o'er
was
an
example
of
what
was
called
a
poetic
license.
It
is
the
freedom
to
change
the
spelling
of
words
to
fit
better
into
a
poem.
I
was
confused.
My
entire
education
so
far
had
consisted
of
learning
the
rules
of
writing.
Now
I
learned
that
some
people
do
not
have
to
follow
these
rules.
I
wondered
where
I
could
get
a
poetic
license.
At
my
high
school
the
indoctrination
of
grammar
rules
continued.
Writing
became
a
means
of
answering
the
questions
posed
by
teachers.
I
became
very
distanced
from
my
writing.
Using
T
was
not
allowed.
It
was
comparable
to
Peter
Jennings',
Brian
Williams',
or
another
generic
anchor's
reading
of
the
evening
news.
A
piece
of
my
writing
conveyed
much
information,
but
nothing
about
me,
the
author.
Opinions
were
strictly
forbidden.
Basically,
if
someone
had
not
said
or
written
it
before,
I
would
not
put
it
in
my
paper.
Originality
was
definitely
not
encouraged.
I
was
a
semi-finalist
in
the
National
Merit
Scholarship
competition
and
becoming
a
finalist
was
based
on
an
essay
written
by
the
contestants.
This
essay
was
supposed
to
show
the
judges
your
achievements
and
contributions
to
society.
An
english
teacher
gave
the
girls
who
were
semi-finalists
a
model
to
follow
when
writing
our
essays.
First,
we
were
to
list
our
academic
achievements;
then
our
extracurricular;
finally
our
volunteer
experience.
It
was
probably
my
lack
of
concrete
achievements
that
led
me
to
customize
my
own
essay.
I
wrote
about
the
relationships
that
I
had
with
certain
people
and
how
I
felt
that
I
had
contributed
to
their
lives.
Both
the
teacher
and
the
principal
warned
me
that
my
essay
was
good,
but
it
would
not
make
me
a
finalist
because
it
was
not
what
they
believed
the
judges
would
be
looking
for.
I
sent
it
in
anyway.
I
still
became
a
finalist.
I
learned
that
teachers
and
principals,
people
who
I
had
always
considered
"experts"
were
not
infallible.
Senior
year
things
began
to
change.
It
was
time
to
apply
to
colleges
and
write
those
dreaded
essays.
Suddenly,
everyone
began
screaming
"Be
original!
You
need
to
make
yourself
stand
out
from
the
other
applicants."
Not
surprisingly,
breaking
out
of
the
grammar
and
information
molds
that
we
were
stuck
in
was
difficult.
My
college
essay
for
Lafayette
began
a
change
in
my
feelings
towards
writing.
I
wrote
about
my
two-year
old
brother
as
a
very
influential
person
in
my
life.
I
explained
how
he
taught
me
the
breadth
of
a
parent's
love
for
a
child.
I
was
able
to
see
how
much
my
parents
cared
for
him.
I
also
felt
the
need
to
protect
and
nurture
him,
the
closest
that
I
have
ever
been
to
complete
unconditional
love.
In
writing
that
essay,
I
could
not
separate
myself
from
my
writing.
It
was
a
new
and
fulfilling
experience.
In
my
college
FYS,
I
was
lucky
to
get
a
wonderful
professor.
He
called
the
papers
that
he
assigned
either
research
papers
or
thought
papers.
Thought
papers
discuss
a
concept
or
issue
without
any
research.
It
was
liberating
for
me
to
write
thought
papers
because
I
was
able
to
write
with
passion.
When
the
ideas
come
from
me
and
not
from
a
"source"
I
feel
more
involved
in
my
writing.
And
being
more
involved
makes
for
better
writing.
