I
can't
really
remember
many
instances
of
writing
before
about
sixth
grade
or
so.
I
recently
came
across
a
paper
I
wrote
in
tenth
grade
about
my
history
as
a
writer.
I
wrote
in
the
paper
that
as
a
child
I
never
thought
that
I
was
a
good
writer,
especially
because
I
disliked
my
handwriting,
I
was
a
bad
speller,
and
I
wasn't
very
good
at
grammar.
But
I
can't
really
remember
having
had
those
feelings
as
a
child
anymore;
I
guess
I
will
just
have
to
take
my
own
word
for
it.
The
earliest
writing
memory
I
have
today
is
from
my
sixth
grade
school
year.
That
year
everyone
in
the
sixth
grade
class
had
creative
writing
once
a
week.
I
don't
remember
what
topics
we
were
given,
but
I
know
that
I
enjoyed
doing
the
assignments.
I
liked
the
freedom
that
creative
writing
allowed
as
opposed
to
the
stricter
bounds
of
writing
in
other
subjects.
Even
better,
the
assignments
often
encouraged
the
students
to
think
about
their
futures,
and
to
record
their
dreams.
Unfortunately
I
don't
have
the
papers
I
wrote
that
year,
so
I
don't
know
exactly
what
I
wrote.
But
I
do
remember
some
of
the
hopes
I
had
for
the
future.
Some
of
them
have
already
come
true.
I
have
hopes
that
others
will
come
true
sometime
in
the
near
future.
And
then
there
are
some
that
I
can't
believe
I
ever
wanted,
because
I
certainly
don't
want
them
now.
During
seventh
and
eighth
grade
my
most
vivid
writing
memories
are
of
journal
writing.
In
seventh
grade
once
a
week
my
class
was
given
fifteen
minutes
or
so
to
write
in
a
journal.
At
the
time,
I
thought
the
whole
idea
was
a
waste
of
time.
I
never
had
much
to
write.
In
fact,
most
of
my
journal
entries
said
nothing
more
than
"I
have
nothing
to
say,"
in
some
variation.
During
eighth
grade
my
class
was
required
to
write
one
journal
entry
per
week
outside
of
classroom
time.
I
wasn't
as
hostile
to
the
idea
of
journal
writing
by
that
year,
but
I
still
wasn't
a
big
fan
of
it.
Once
in
awhile
the
teacher
would
give
us
topics
such
as
"If
you
could
be
any
car,
what
would
you
be
and
why?"
I
liked
the
weeks
when
we
got
topics
best.
It
was
easy
for
me
to
come
up
with
a
creative
answer
to
an
unconventional
question
or
topic.
Things
were
tougher,
however,
when
I
had
to
come
up
with
that
topic
myself.
I
could
never
think
of
anything
to
write
about,
and
so
most
of
my
entries
were
just
plain
old
boring.
There's
a
lot
of
"I
don't
have
anything
to
write
about."
And
some
"This
is
what
I
did
this
weekend"
(usually
nothing
interesting
there
either!).
Once
in
a
great
while
if
I
had
a
study
hall
and
no
work
to
do
I
would
spend
the
period
trying
to
come
up
with
something
(anything!)
interesting
to
write
about,
and
once
in
awhile
I
would
succeed.
Looking
back
on
those
entries
now
(yes
fortunately
I
have
just
about
everything
I've
written
after
sixth
grade),
I
am
somewhat
surprised
that
I
was
that
perceptive
at
thirteen.
I
can
definitely
see
myself
today
in
my
writings
from
six
years
ago.
Yet
at
the
same
time,
there
are
many
aspects
of
my
current
self
that
are
strikingly
different
than
my
younger
self.
For
instance,
just
the
fact
that
there
were
times
that
I
had
nothing
to
write
about
shocks
me.
I
think
that
if
I
were
asked
to
write
an
entry
even
everyday
now,
I
would
be
able
to
come
up
with
a
new
and
somewhat
interesting
topic
for
each
one.
Writing
really
became
a
lot
more
important,
both
academically
and
personally,
during
my
ninth
grade
year.
That
year
my
class
continued
doing
journal
entries
(two
a
week-
one
on
a
given
topic,
and
one
on
our
own
topic),
but
a
lot
more
attention
was
placed
on
something
called
GAPs.
GAP
stood
for
"gimme
a
paragraph;"
like
journal
entries,
they
were
sometimes
on
a
given
topic
and
sometimes
not.
But
GAPs
were
more
formal
than
journal
articles.
GAPs
had
to
be
typed
(lucky
for
me
ninth
grade
was
the
year
my
parents
decided
to
get
a
computer),
and
unlike
journal
grades,
grammar
and
spelling
mistakes
could
bring
down
GAP
grades.
I
liked
GAPs
more
than
journals.
Why?
I'm
not
totally
sure.
I
liked
typing
for
one
thing;
I
still
do.
Finding
something
to
write
about
became
easier
as
I
did
more
and
more
GAPs,
and
I
started
finding
that
I
was
giving
more
than
a
paragraph.
By
the
end
of
the
year
I
was
giving
more
like
a
page.
That
problem/blessing/quirk
(there
are
so
many
ways
to
look
at
it!)
of
having
a
lot
to
write
is
still
with
me
to
this
day.
Ninth
grade
was
also
the
year
that
all
students
in
honors
English
in
my
school
were
introduced
to
the
thesis.
Up
until
that
time
around
early
spring
we
had,
of
course,
been
asked
to
write
academically
before.
We
had
written
personal
essays
and
we
had
written
about
literary
works.
But
never
before
had
we
been
asked
to
put
so
much
effort
and
attention
into
organizing
an
essay
and
making
it
coherent.
And
yet,
we
students,
being
fourteen,
assumed
that
we
knew
everything
there
was
to
know
about
writing,
and
that
the
teacher
was
just
spending
way
too
much
time
emphasizing
the
importance
of
one
little
sentence
called
the
thesis
statement.
We
assumed
this
was
true
through
the
weeks
of
lessons
about
topic
sentences,
supporting
sentences,
introductions
and
conclusions.
We
assumed
it
until
the
time
came
for
us
to
write
our
own
paper
integrating
all
that
we
learned.
Then
we
started
to
appreciate
all
the
weeks
of
practice
coming
up
with
thesis
statements
and
such.
And
almost
a
month
later
(I
still
can't
believe
we
had
almost
a
month
to
write
a
five
paragraph
essay!),
after
notes,
and
an
outline,
and
a
rough
draft,
we
turned
in
our
papers.
The
topic
was
our
own
to
choose.
I
chose
to
write
about
criminal
sentencing.
Now
I
cannot
for
the
life
of
me
remember
the
details
of
the
topic,
but
I
remember
vividly
creating
a
thesis
statement
and
supporting
it
with
three
points,
one
in
each
paragraph.
I
wasn't
much
of
a
fan
of
this
whole
process
of
learning
to
write.
It
felt
too
structured
to
me;
it
felt
almost
like
a
formula
we
would
learn
in
math
class,
and
up
until
then
I
had
thought
of
writing
as
the
complete
opposite
of
math
(not
that
I'm
knocking
math-1
love
math!).
And
so
I
remember
leaving
ninth
grade
and
not
quite
looking
forward
to
tenth
grade
English
class.
Thankfully,
tenth
grade
turned
out
much
better
than
I
had
anticipated.
That
year
there
was
a
focus
on
both
creative
writing
and
literary
criticism
type
writing.
On
the
creative
end
we
had
writing
prompts
due
every
two
weeks
or
so.
The
teacher
would
give
us
some
type
of
sensory
stimulation
(a
picture,
a
song,
a
phrase,
food)
and
ask
us
to
write
about
it.
We
could
write
poems,
stories,
essays-
anything
our
little
hearts
desired.
I
enjoyed
those
immensely.
On
the
day
they
were
due
we
would
spend
twenty
minutes
or
so
passing
them
around
the
room
so
we
could
read
each
other's
work.
The
best
part
of
the
prompts
was
hearing
other
people
say:
"that
was
really
good/funny/entertaining."
Of
course
we
also
put
our
thesis
statement
skills
to
work
that
year.
The
first
few
assignments
were
personal
essays;
we
wrote
about
our
favorite
teacher,
our
neighborhood,
and
our
childhood.
Then
we
picked
up
the
pace
and
started
writing
things
like
book
reviews,
research
papers
about
one
author,
and
literary
analyses
about
novels
and
poems.
It
was
probably
during
tenth
grade
that
I
began
to
feel
most
comfortable
writing
academically.
I
consistently
received
high
grades
on
my
papers
(but
those
spelling
and
grammar
mistakes
were
still
costing
me),
and
my
teacher
seemed
to
be
somewhat
(but
definitely
not
overly)
impressed
with
my
writing.
That
gave
me
enough
confidence
to
really
start
to
appreciate
writing.
Armed
with
that
confidence
as
I
entered
eleventh
grade,
I
really
began
to
love
writing
that
year.
In
class
we
unfortunately
had
to
abandon
creative
writing
for
other
endeavors,
but
I
continued
writing
creatively
on
my
own.
In
order
to
graduate
from
my
school
district
all
students
had
to
complete
a
graduation
project,
and
then
write
a
short
paper
about
what
they
did.
For
my
project
I
wrote
and
put
together
a
collection
of
poems
and
essays.
I
worked
on
poems
about
whatever
I
was
feeling,
and
I
wrote
essays
on
things
like
politics
and
religion
throughout
the
year.
Unfortunately
the
graduation
project
system
was
a
new
one,
and
it
had
more
than
a
few
bugs
in
it.
That
really
put
a
damper
on
doing
the
writing,
but
for
the
most
part
I
enjoyed
it.
In
class
that
year
we
started
off
by
writing
a
paper
on
a
current
event
to
get
everyone
back
in
the
writing
mode.
Then
we
jumped
right
into
essays
on
literary
works
like
Beowulf
and
Macbeth.
Most
of
these
essays
were
a
response
to
a
question
posed
by
the
teacher.
At
the
end
of
the
year
we
had
to
write
a
ten-page
research
paper
connecting
two
novels
by
different
authors.
I
think
a
lot
of
my
success
in
that
class
stemmed
from
the
fact
that
I
really
enjoyed
what
I
was
reading.
My
two
novels
were
Brave
New
World
and
1984,
and
I
still
recommend
them
to
people
looking
for
some
good
books
to
read.
And
so
from
that
research
paper
I
also
discovered
something
else
about
writing-
how
very
inextricably
tied
it
is
to
reading.
That
fact
in
itself
was
good
news
to
me,
because
I
have
always
loved
to
read.
My
teacher
for
eleventh
grade
English
continued
to
give
me
high
grades
on
my
papers,
but
she
also
gave
me
praise
for
my
writing.
One
assignment
we
were
given
was
to
read
a
Shakespearean
sonnet
(we
were
each
assigned
a
different
one),
attempt
to
understand
it,
and
then
write
an
essay
analyzing
it.
That
was
probably
the
most
difficult
assignment
we
had
all
year,
and
I
was
definitely
not
expecting
to
do
a
very
good
job
on
it.
Thus
I
was
downright
shocked
when
I
got
the
paper
back
a
few
weeks
later
and
saw
the
comment
"In
my
opinion
this
is
publishable."
That
was
certainly
nice
to
hear,
and
it
certainly
convinced
me
that
I
had
some
real
talent
when
it
came
to
writing.
Yet
even
after
having
received
a
comment
like
that,
I
was
still
a
little
uneasy
going
into
my
twelfth
grade
AP
English
class.
I
had
heard
how
much
work
it
was,
and
frankly
I
was
afraid
that
my
writing
might
not
hold
up
too
well
against
the
top
fifteen
or
so
writers
in
my
grade.
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
then,
only
a
few
weeks
later,
to
find
myself
absolutely
loving
the
class,
and
loving
the
writing
assignments.
Again
I
think
a
lot
of
it
had
to
do
with
the
fact
that
I
really
enjoyed
the
reading
(and
there
was
a
lot
of
it).
Most
of
the
papers
assigned
were
three
to
five
page
answers
to
one
of
two
or
three
questions
posed
by
the
teacher.
We
were
also
asked
to
analyze
poems,
and
we
completed
one
ten
to
fifteen-page
research
paper
on
three
or
four
novels
by
the
same
author.
My
teacher's
comments
on
my
papers
were
always
full
of
praise.
More
often
than
not
she
would
write
that
I
had
a
great
sense
of
humor,
even
when
I
was
not
even
trying
to
be
funny.
During
my
senior
year
I
also
took
classes
at
Lehigh.
I
had
Introduction
to
Women's
Studies
in
the
Spring
semester.
Technically
Lehigh
students
had
to
take
freshman
English
before
taking
the
class
(so
everyone
in
the
class
was
at
least
a
sophomore),
but
thankfully
the
school
let
me
take
it
anyway.
We
had
about
five
short
papers
assigned
throughout
the
semester
along
with
a
journal
in
which
we
were
to
respond
to
readings.
I
enjoyed
all
of
the
writing.
After
the
first
collection
of
the
journals
about
one
third
of
the
way
through
the
semester
a
lot
of
people
received
low
grades
because
they
weren't
spending
enough
time,
or
they
weren't
writing
enough.
I
must
have
been
writing
a
lot
more
though,
because
I
got
an
A.
I
heard
some
classmates
complain
that
they
didn't
have
any
opinion
or
reaction
to
what
we
were
reading.
I
couldn't
understand
how
they
didn't
have
a
reaction
to
it;
having
an
opinion
is
just
automatic
for
me.
Before
the
class
started
I
was
a
little
scared
about
being
in
a
class
with
students
who
were
two
to
four
years
ahead
of
me
academically.
But
I
ended
up
doing
very
well
on
all
the
assignments
(all
of
which
were
writing
oriented).
That
experience
really
made
me
feel
confident
about
college
writing
(maybe
a
little
too
confident).
My
only
writing
intense
class
during
my
first
semester
at
Lafayette
was
my
FYS.
I
loved
that
class.
The
professor
was
great
and
I
enjoyed
the
subject
matter
immensely.
I
also
seemed
to
be
able
to
grasp
the
material
pretty
easily.
That's
why
I
was
somewhat
shocked
and
disappointed
when
on
the
first
paper
I
received
a
B+/A-.
Honestly,
I
had
not
seen
a
B
on
a
writing
assignment
in
a
very
long
time.
But
I
ended
up
gradually
improving
with
each
subsequent
paper.
By
the
end
of
the
semester
I
was
once
again
confident
in
my
ability,
but
I
also
realized
just
how
much
hard
work
good
writing
demands.
Since
my
FYS
was
a
philosophy
class,
I
also
learned
that
there
is
a
huge
difference
(for
me
at
least)
between
writing
in
an
English
class
and
writing
in
a
philosophy
class.
Since
the
majority
of
my
writing
before
college
had
been
for
English
classes
I
was
used
to
using
what
I
call
"flowery
language".
I
am
infamous
for
using
an
interesting
quote
to
begin
a
paper,
and
I
try
to
incorporate
creative
writing
within
expository
writing.
This
seems
to
work
well
in
papers
for
English
and
women's
studies
classes,
but
it
doesn't
work
at
all
in
philosophy.
That
was
something
that
took
some
time
to
get
used
to.
I
ended
up
doing
a
lot
more
writing
my
second
semester,
both
in
philosophy
classes
and
in
an
English
class.
I
think
I
like
things
that
way
the
best:
writing
in
both
philosophy
and
English.
Taking
both
types
of
classes
gives
me
the
freedom
and
the
opportunity
to
develop
two
variations
of
one
skill
which
I
love.
