My
first
memories
as
a
writer
go
back
to
kindergarten,
to
the
time
when
I
was
taught
the
alphabet
and
how
to
print
my
name
with
a
crayon,
under
a
drawing
I
had
just
made.
I
can
recall
copying
down
the
alphabet
many
times,
and
being
a
victim
of
dyslexia.
I
was
consistently
writing
the
letters
backwards.
Memories
of
my
first
years
at
school
are
sprinkled
with
visions
of
myself,
sitting
in
a
little
desk
and
busily
copying
vocabularies,
and
doing
exercises
in
my
spelling
book.
I
recall
being
a
fairly
good
speller,
and
being
rewarded
with
little
gold
and
silver
stars
in
my
forehead.
Those
little
stars
made
me
very
happy.
My
first
clear
memory
of
a
research
paper
was
in
third
grade.
We
were
assigned
a
two
page
paper
on
a
country
of
our
interest.
The
paper
was
to
be
well
presented,
and
include
a
bibliography
and
illustrations.
My
country
of
choice
was
Australia,
since
I
have
always
loved
koalas,
and
I
researched
it
in
my
father's
encyclopedia.
I
wrote
my
paper
in
my
best
hand
writing,
on
very
nice
white
paper
that
my
mother
had
given
me.
Special
attention
was
given
to
the
illustrations,
and
when
the
paper
was
done
I
was
quite
pleased
with
it.
It
was
the
most
important
assignment
we
had
had
that
year
for
our
geography
class,
and
I
remember
doing
well
on
it.
I
also
seem
to
remember
that
it
was
at
around
this
time,
going
from
third
to
fourth
grade,
that
I
made
the
transition
from
using
a
pencil
to
using
a
pen.
I
think
that
it
was
quite
an
important
transition,
since
by
that
time
I
had
gained
enough
confidence
in
my
writing
to
not
have
to
constantly
use
my
little
eraser.
Actually,
I
felt
quite
mature,
since
using
a
pen
showed,
I
thought
at
the
time,
that
I
was
a
serious
student
who
quite
definitely
knew
what
she
was
doing.
I
remember
taking
pride
on
my
work
since
I
was
very
small.
School
was
always
important
for
me,
and
my
mommy
never
had
to
worry
about
my
homework,
since
I
enjoyed
doing
it.
I
guess
I
have
always
been
a
bit
of
a
nerd,
and
reading
and
writing
were
never
difficult
for
me.
Actually,
I
loved
to
read.
I
was
a
quiet,
shy
little
girl
who
loved
to
run
and
play,
but
who
had
a
special
love
for
hiding
in
the
room
I
shared
with
my
little
brother
and
reading
and
reading
and
reading.
I
can
fondly
remember
Clifford:
the
Big
Red
Dog
series
as
being
my
favorite
books
my
first
years
of
school.
I
can
later
remember
graduating
into
the
Hardy
Boys
Adventures
and
the
Nancy
Drew
Mystery
Stories
by
fourth
grade.
Then
in
fifth
grade
my
daddy
gave
me
The
Three
Musketeers,
by
Alexander
Dumas,
as
birthday
present.
I
loved
it.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
stayed
up
all
night
reading
a
book,
and
still
when
I
look
back
upon
all
the
books
I
have
read
until
now,
almost
ten
years
later,
I
still
think
that
sleepless
night
was
worth
it.
It
is
such
a
good
book.
That
book
opened
up
a
world
for
me.
I
started
devouring
my
daddy's
and
my
grandfather's
libraries,
reading
all
other
works
by
Dumas,
as
well
as
other
authors
such
as
Victor
Hugo,
Paul
Feval,
Moliere
and
Shakespeare.
Perhaps
it
is
strange
that
in
a
narrative
on
my
history
as
a
writer
I
go
into
such
lengths
describing
my
experiences
as
a
reader.
However,
I
believe
that
more
than
any
formal
training
on
writing,
it
was
my
avidness
as
a
reader
that
shaped
me
into
the
writer
that
I
am
today.
I
think
that
it
was
through
reading,
and
learning
from
different
authors
and
different
styles
that
taught
me
how
to
express
my
thoughts,
ideas
and
feelings
through
writing.
As
my
mommy
says,
you
can
only
learn
how
to
write
by
reading.
There
is
also
another
aspect
in
my
experience
as
both
a
reader
and
a
writer
that
I
think
is
very
important
in
this
narration.
I
was
born
in
Bolivia,
a
Spanish
speaking
country
in
the
heart
of
South
America.
I
was
raised
in
Spanish,
though
I
attended
an
American
school
since
kindergarten.
I
was
taught
how
to
read
and
write
in
English,
but
I
can
recall
that
once
I
learned
how
to
read
and
write
in
English,
I
was
also
able
to
do
so
in
Spanish.
My
school
offers
both,
the
American
and
the
Bolivian
diploma,
and
in
addition
to
the
usual
curriculum
followed
by
American
schools,
part
of
our
curriculum
were
courses
in
Bolivian
history
and
geography
and
Spanish
literature
.
Hence,
much
of
the
reading
I
did
during
my
school
years
was
in
Spanish,
both
for
pleasure
and
for
school.
The
books
I
read
from
my
daddy's
and
my
grandfather's
libraries
were
in
Spanish,
and
in
my
history
and
literature
classes
I
was
introduced
to
authors
like
Cervantes,
and
prominent
Bolivian
writers
and
poets
such
as
Nataniel
Aguirre,
Alcides
Arguedas
and
Adela
Zamudio.
It
was
through
this
combination
of
both
English
and
Spanish
literature
that
I
feel
that
I
started
to
develop
my
current
writing
style.
I
enjoyed
writing,
both
in
English
and
Spanish,
and
I
remember
having
little
difficulty
doing
my
writing
assignments.
It
seemed
that
I
had
a
little
inner
voice
which
practically
dictated
what
I
was
going
to
write,
and
X
had
a
lot
of
fun
being
creative,
both
in
writing
and
in
interpreting
the
works
we
read
for
school.
I
was
fortunate
to
have
very
good
and
encouraging
literature
professors
all
through
my
school
years.
I
can
especially
recall
Mrs.
Abud,
my
Spanish
literature
professor
from
tenth
to
twelfth
grade,
as
being
an
interesting
and
challenging
professor,
and
a
fair
critic
of
my
writing.
Through
my
school
years
I
had
gotten
good
grades
in
my
writing
courses,
but
it
was
in
her
class
where
I
learned
about
literary
criticism,
about
truly
analyzing,
understanding
and
trying
to
interpret
a
literary
work.
Her
class
introduced
me
to
the
beauty
of
poems,
though
I
had
generally
shunned
away
from
poetry,
preferring
adventure
stories,
biographies
and
novels.
Being
herself
a
literary
critic,
she
would
do
more
than
give
me
a
grade
for
my
work.
My
work
was
severely
criticized,
my
opinions
were
questioned,
and
many
times
my
paper
had
so
much
red
ink
on
it
that
I
could
barely
read
it.
At
that
time,
I
was
very
glad
that
I
was
using
a
computer
(Word
Perfect
3.1,
I
think)
because
I
often
had
to
rewrite
a
paper
a
couple
of
times.
I
think
that
I
would
have
gone
quite
mad,
had
I
been
using
a
type
writer,
like
I
did
from
fifth
through
seventh
grade.
Mrs.
Abud
was
one
of
the
hardest
graders
I
have
known
in
my
academic
career.
Yet,
as
I
look
back
I
a
very
grateful
to
her.
Though
she
was
a
severe
critic,
she
was
always
fair
and
in
her
class
I
learned
to
criticize
my
own
writing,
to
question
my
ideas
and
to
look
at
things
from
several
different
points
of
view
when
writing
about
them.
I
think
I
became
a
more
observant
and
understanding
reader
and
writer,
and
my
writing
greatly
improved
in
the
years
in
her
class.
She
was
hard,
yet
very
encouraging
at
all
moments.
She
would
say
that
she
enjoyed
my
writing,
and
that
she
thought
that
I
would
make
a
good
professional
author.
I
would
sometimes
write
short
stories,
for
fun,
and
show
them
to
her.
When
she
said
that
she
enjoyed
some
of
them,
I
would
be
very
happy.
When
I
at
last
graduated,
and
prepared
to
come
to
Lafayette,
I
was
pretty
confident
of
my
writing
skills.
I
had
done
quite
well
in
my
writing
classes
in
school,
and
in
the
verbal
SAT.
I
had
been
reading
what
were
considered
college
level
books
for
some
time,
and
I
enjoyed
them.
Though
I
was
very
nervous
at
facing
the
unknown,
I
hoped
that
everything
would
go
well.
My
First
Year
Seminar
was
quite
a
surprise.
I
had
not
signed
up
for
it,
but
had
gotten
stuck
with
it
by
events
beyond
my
control.
However,
it
was
a
good
experience.
The
professor
was
amiable
and
fun,
and
though
I
didn't
expect
it
at
first,
the
course
was
very
interesting.
We
were
often
asked
to
reflect
on
the
assigned
readings,
a
reflection
being
approximately
a
two-paged
essay.
The
professor
strongly
encouraged
appropriately
documenting
our
papers,
and,
I
did
a
lot
of
research
in
order
to
write
the
two
term
papers
we
had
for
the
course.
I
was
fascinated
with
the
number
of
resources
that
the
library
had,
since
the
library
in
my
school
had
been
very
small
and
I
was
often
faced
with
the
problem
of
not
finding
enough
information
for
my
papers.
In
college,
I
was
overwhelmed
with
the
amount
of
information
available.
The
professor
was
very
helpful,
and
made
clear
exactly
what
he
expected
from
our
papers.
He
expected
and
educated,
well-informed
and
well
written
paper.
Though
I
had
written
some
formal
reports
and
research
papers
in
high
school,
I
was
very
nervous
when
I
handed
in
my
first
paper,
since
I
didn't
really
know
if
the
level
of
my
writing
was
appropriate
for
college.
Nevertheless,
I
received
very
positive
feedback,
and
I
remember
my
professor
saying
that
my
papers
showed
a
fine
intellect
.
It
was
a
very
nice
of
him.
I
think
I
learned
a
lot
about
writing
in
the
course,
especially
about
presenting
a
formal,
college-level
research
paper.
I
major
in
biochemistry,
and
as
a
science
student
another
aspect
of
my
experience
as
a
writer
in
college
was
writing
laboratory
reports
for
many
of
my
classes.
I
found
this
very
challenging,
since
I
had
had
very
little
experience
in
writing
formal
lab
reports
in
school.
Writing
my
first
lab
report
was
a
very
stressful
experience,
since
I
kept
thinking
that
it
was
not
formal
or
scientific
enough.
Fortunately,
I
was
given
a
clear
format
to
follow;
it
made
a
lot
of
sense
and
made
the
writing
easier.
My
lab
instructor
was
also
very
helpful
when
I
approached
him
for
help.
The
best
part
of
all
is
that
most
lab
reports
have
basically
the
same
format,
and
once
you
learn
how
to
write
coherent
and
scientific
lab
reports
for
one
class,
you
can
do
it
for
other
classes.
As
a
research
student,
I
was
also
asked
to
write
formal
scientific
research
papers.
These
are
in
many
ways
similar
to
a
laboratory
report,
though
much
more
research
and
documentation
are
involved.
I
think
that
one
of
the
most
rewarding
writing
experience
that
I
have
had
was
the
final
research
paper
that
I
wrote
for
the
research
I
did
this
last
summer.
It
felt
like
that
culmination
of
many
weeks
of
hard
work,
and
I
think
it
is
the
biggest
project
I
have
ever
done.
Putting
all
the
data
together
and
drawing
conclusions
form
it,
as
well
as
attempting
to
present
it
in
a
clear
and
concise
manner
was
not
easy,
but
once
completed
it
was
very
rewarding.
I
think
that
it
was
one
of
my
best
experiences,
both
as
a
writer
and
as
a
science
student.
Finally,
I
am
looking
forward
to
what
I
hope
will
also
be
one
of
the
most
rewarding
and
enjoyable
experiences
I
will
have
as
a
writer
in
college.
I
am
now
a
writing
associate
(WA),
and
will
be
working
this
coming
semester
with
the
students
of
a
VAST
course
which
deals
with
ecology
and
the
protection
of
the
environment.
I
feel
very
fortunate
at
being
given
this
opportunity,
and
hope
to
learn
much
from
helping
other
students
with
their
writing
assignments.
I
think
that
by
reading
their
work
and
helping
them
with
their
problems,
my
skills
as
a
writer
will
also
improve.
I
hope
this
will
be
a
good
semester,
and
a
good
year.
