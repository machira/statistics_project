Striving
to
Meet
The
New
Yorker
Standard:
My
Journey
as
a
Writer
Lafayette
College
Prof.
Bianca
Falbo
I
stayed
up
late
that
night.
In
fact,
I
stayed
up
very
late
D
well
into
those
lonely
morning
hours
when
everyone
except
you
seems
to
be
asleep.
But
the
report
that
I
had
been
working
on
for
my
psychology
lab
looked,
at
least
from
my
subjective
vantage,
like
a
well-polished
product,
no
doubt
a
fitting
end
to
my
tireless
labor.
So,
naturally,
when
the
lab
professor
began
handing
back
the
classOs
submissions
two
weeks
later,
I
started
to
tremble
with
excitement
of
a
sort
that
any
creator
would
feel
in
anticipation
of
deserved
recognition,
of
praise,
of
acknowledgment
from
an
assessor
that
his
work
is
objectively
good
D
perhaps
quite
good.
But
before
I
knew
it,
everyone
seemed
to
be
sifting
through
pages,
and
the
professor
had
moved
to
the
front
of
the
class.
Where
is
my
paper?
I
though
to
myself.
Then,
the
professorOs
voice:
NI
apologize
for
not
having
all
the
papers
with
me.
[E]
Josh
and
[E],
your
reports
should
be
ready
a
couple
of
hours
after
class.
YouOre
both
welcome
to
pick
them
up
then.O
Well,
this
is
just
great.
IOve
been
looking
forward
to
lab
all
day,
and
this
is
what
I
get.
What
luck.
[E]
My
earliest
memories
of
writing
extend
back
to
when
I
was
about
five
years
old.
What
I
was
doing
at
that
time,
though,
cannot
qualify
as
writing
in
the
traditional
sense.
For
it
was
merely
my
learning
to
transcribe
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
into
words
and
sentences
onto
paper
D
first
by
simply
getting
a
feel
for
the
letters
themselves,
then,
more
complexly,
by
copying
my
name,
and
ultimately
by
copying
full
sentences,
until
I
had
developed
a
sturdy
enough
confidence
in
my
new-found
ability
to
feel
comfortable
writing
without
the
help
of
my
parents
or
grandmother,
who
had
all
encouraged
me
in
this
process.
Every
so
often,
I
conjure
up
recollections
of
these
early
years
and
marvel
at
how
I
ever
could
have
been
challenged
by
something
that
now
seems
nothing
more
than
reflexive
and
inborn.
Of
course,
as
every
other
child
must
do
at
one
point
or
another,
I,
too,
had
to
learn
to
transform
letters
D
which,
though
I
was
already
reading,
still
seemed
abstract
D
into
their
concrete
patterns.
It
was
around
this
time
that
I
entered
elementary
school,
where,
for
the
next
three
years,
I
was
asked
to
write
in
a
number
of
different
ways;
summarizing
newspaper
articles
for
current
events,
experimenting
with
the
Japanese
poetry
style
of
haiku,
and
writing
short
fiction
stories
were
the
norm.
In
the
fourth
grade,
however,
required
writings
became
more
difficult.
With
expectations
from
my
teacher
higher
than
any
I
had
previously
encountered
from
others,
I
experienced
my
first
taste
of
a
research
paper
that
year,
in
an
assignment
that
called
for
the
exploration
of
any
one
of
the
various
Native
American
tribes
that
once
inhabited
America.
Although
there
seemed
to
be
no
dull
or
uninteresting
clan,
some
tribes
were
more
fully
discussed
in
library
reference
books.
After
my
classmates
had
realized
this,
most
made
a
mad
rush
to
borrow
books
on
the
popular
Iroquois
or
Mohegan
Indians.
For
some
reason,
I
decided
to
buck
the
trend,
eventually
choosing
to
research
the
Tlinget
Indians
of
southwestern
Alaska,
who,
at
best,
were
only
sparsely
written
about.
But
the
gains
that
I
could
see
in
my
ability
to
create
a
sentence,
to
expound
an
idea,
as
well
as
to
use
the
findings
of
other
people
to
support
my
own
thoughts
were
well
worth
the
effort.
Granted,
the
writing
was
a
bit
crude,
a
bit
awkward.
In
a
thousand
years,
it
wouldnOt
have
been
mistaken
for
something
out
of
The
New
Yorker.
Most
important,
though,
the
struggles
that
I
had
confronted
in
constructing
a
paper
of
this
more
trying
format
came
to
represent
a
necessary
preliminary
stage
in
the
writing
career
on
which
I
would
embark
in
earnest
nearly
three
years
later.
While
the
fourth
grade
might
have
marked
my
earliest
introduction
to
the
research
paper,
it
was
in
a
seventh
grade
accelerated
global
studies
class
that
I
learned
about
the
methodology
and
style
of
this
particular
genre.
Building
on
what
I
had
merely
dabbled
in
before,
the
course
was
significant
on
two
fronts:
it
not
only
familiarized
me
with
the
components
of
a
typical
academic
research
paper,
but
allowed
me
to
recognize
my
capacity
for
using
the
written
word
to
communicate
ideas
skillfully
and
effectively.
From
day
one,
my
classmates
and
I
were
flooded
with
information
on
thesis
statements,
Nworks
citedO
pages,
and
internal
citations.
We
learned,
for
instance,
that
a
thesis
should
be
narrow
in
scope
and
should
contain
a
statement
of
topic,
as
well
as
a
comment
on
that
topic.
We
also
received
countless
pages
of
explanations
and
examples
of
theses.
The
lessons
on
citations
were
equally,
if
not
more,
comprehensive.
Of
course,
the
true
test
was
trying
to
successfully
apply
this
new
information
to
the
assigned
research
projects.
I
can
still
recall
the
frustration
that
I
felt
while
writing
the
first
paper
of
the
year
D
an
exploration
of
the
relationship
between
Nathaniel
HawthorneOs
ancestry
and
the
themes
of
his
major
works.
For
hours,
I
was
totally
stymied.
I
didnOt
know
which
works
I
wanted
to
address,
or
even
how
many
I
wanted
to
discuss.
There
was
also
the
question
of
what
role
his
ancestry
had
played
in
influencing
his
works.
After
several
minutes
of
purely
focused
thinking,
however,
I
was
able
to
identify
the
direction
that
I
predicted
the
paper
would
take.
In
the
end,
the
thesis
looked
something
like
this:
NDistressed
by
the
austere
tradition
that
defined
his
Puritan
family
line,
Hawthorne
infused
his
works
with
such
solemn
issues
as
morality
and
sin.O
Over
the
course
of
the
year,
the
quality
of
my
thesis
statements
remained
about
the
same.
The
primary
difference
between
this
first
thesis
and
the
one
that
I
wrote
for
the
final
paper
was
one
of
efficiency.
Overall,
I
found
that
I
had
begun
to
write
less
strenuously
and
with
much
greater
ease.
WhatOs
more,
with
the
help
of
a
sort
of
Nhow-to
guideO
that
I
had
fashioned
for
myself
D
essentially,
the
plan
that
I
followed
whenever
I
approached
a
paper
D
my
writing
became
cleaner,
crisper,
and
more
powerful.
By
the
end
of
the
second
semester,
I
realized
that
I
had
a
certain
knack
for
writing.
Yet,
how
long
would
it
be
before
anyone
else
(besides
my
parents)
also
came
to
this
realization?
As
a
high
school
sophomore,
I
enrolled
in
Advanced
Placement
European
History.
A
course
that
stresses
logical
and
cohesive
writing,
in
addition
to
sound
argumentative
technique,
it
culminates
in
a
final
standardized
exam
that
contains
a
number
of
self-generated
response
sections.
One
of
those
sections
is
made
up
of
a
single
document-based
question,
in
which
the
student
is
asked
to
use
the
documents
that
are
provided,
as
well
as
his
independent
knowledge
from
class,
to
develop
an
argument
in
response
to
a
given
statement.
Much
of
the
assigned
work,
therefore,
focused
on
honing
the
classOs
ability
to
write
persuasively,
with
an
emphasis
on
the
use
of
outside
evidence
to
substantiate
our
arguments.
Because
of
the
extensive
experience
with
research
papers
that
I
already
had
tucked
away,
I
felt
well-prepared
to
field
this
new
stylistic
approach.
My
feeling
proved
true.
Just
a
few
papers
into
the
start
of
the
year,
and
my
teacher
was
thoroughly
impressed
with
the
work
that
I
was
producing.
He
liked,
for
instance,
that
I
could
use
a
sophisticated
diction
with
what
appeared
to
be
D
indeed,
with
what
was
D
such
unusual
facility
for
a
person
of
only
fifteen
or
sixteen
years.
He
also
expressed
high
regard
for
the
cogency
and
logical
organization
of
my
writing
D
both
privately
to
me
and
publicly
to
the
class.
I
felt
at
the
time,
as
I
still
do
today,
grateful
for
this
effusive
recognition.
But
there
was
no
question
in
my
mind
that
I
deserved
it.
Through
my
efforts
and
natural
affinity
for
writing,
I
had
emerged
as
one
of
the
classOs
best
writers
D
if
not
the
best.
If
the
fourth
grade
was
a
starting
point
in
my
writing
career,
and
the
seventh
a
declaration
of
my
intent
to
pursue
writing
seriously,
then
tenth
grade
mirrored
Acts
I
and
II
in
a
typical
Shakespeare
play.
That
is,
it
set
the
stage
for
a
climax
that,
sooner
or
later,
was
bound
to
come.
The
following
academic
year,
I
took
A.P.
English
Language
&
Composition,
the
equivalent
of
an
introductory
college
writing
course.
Young
and
enthusiastic,
the
course
instructor
was
eager
to
experiment
with
different
methods
of
teaching
the
class
how
to
write
effectively.
For
me,
this
meant
engaging
in
styles
and
techniques
which
I
was
unfamiliar
with:
journals,
reading
logs,
freewriting
and
brainstorming,
even
parodies.
Aside
from
these
periodic
stylistic
excursions,
however,
the
class
was
mostly
grounded
in
applying
argumentative
style
to
literary
works.
My
classmates
and
I
received
heavy
training
in
analyzing
the
various
rhetorical
strategies
and
methods
of
different
authors,
particularly
in
looking
at
how
they
fitted
these
devices
to
their
various
literary
goals.
Our
essays,
therefore,
reflected
this
training.
Often,
we
would
be
asked
to
discuss
the
means
by
which
an
author
created
a
certain
theme
or
mood.
Perhaps
it
was
through
symbolism,
characterization,
and
juxtaposition,
as
F.
Scott
Fitzgerald
did
in
The
Great
Gatsby,
or
through
word
choice
and
metaphor,
which
Lewis
Thomas
relied
almost
exclusively
on
in
his
Lives
of
a
Cell.
Sometimes,
too,
we
would
have
to
describe
in
compare-and-contrast
papers
how
similarities
and
differences
between
characters
were
accentuated
through
the
use
of
rhetorical
strategy.
Whatever
the
task,
I
always
gave
my
all.
Like
the
A.P.
European
teacher
before
her,
the
instructor
of
this
course
held
my
writing
in
high
esteem,
both
for
its
logical
and
thorough
development
and
for
its
flowing
rhythm.
The
satisfaction
that
I
felt
was
overwhelming.
I
was
experiencing
a
surge
of
euphoria,
something
very
similar
to
the
NrunnerOs
high.O
After
years
of
writing,
I
had
finally
developed
not
only
a
characteristic
style,
but
one
in
which
I
could
take
immense
pride.
A
year
later,
I
would
be
starting
college.
Although
the
prospect
was
daunting
D
after
all,
never
before
had
I
lived
away
from
home
D
the
work
I
expected
to
come
across
insofar
as
writing
and
research
were
concerned
did
not
worry
me.
In
relative
terms,
I
believed
that
I
was
standing
on
as
strong
a
foundation
as
any
other
peer;
in
absolute
terms,
as
well,
I
had
full
confidence
in
my
ability
and
technique.
That
is,
I
knew
how
to
develop
an
idea
and
to
support
it
with
evidence.
Even
though
the
papers
in
college
would
likely
be
longer
and
more
complex
than
those
that
I
had
previously
done,
they
would
still
have
to
be
based
on
valid,
credible
argumentation,
which,
clearly,
I
was
well-versed
in.
For
the
most
part,
my
predictions
played
out
as
I
had
planned.
The
assignments
for
my
first
year
seminar
class
demanded
intensive
library
research,
as
well
as
the
ability
to
fully
expound
an
argument.
The
one
salient
difference,
of
course,
between
the
writing
that
I
did
for
this
seminar
and
that
which
I
had
done
in
the
past
was
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
papers
was
harder.
Two
of
the
three
papers
that
I
submitted,
for
instance,
discussed
legal
theory;
the
third,
on
Franz
KafkaOs
The
Trial,
touched
on
existential
philosophy.
There
were
two
other
differences,
as
well.
The
first
was
that
while
I
had
yet
to
reach
the
point
where,
as
I
noted
earlier,
my
work
might
be
confused
with
something
out
of
The
New
Yorker
D
a
veritable
end-all
standard
for
me
D
I
could
feel
myself
approaching
that
juncture
much
more
rapidly
than
I
had
before.
Indeed,
I
noticed
that
I
had
become
more
adept
at
analyzing
my
thoughts
on
paper,
at
vetting
and
completely
tearing
apart
an
idea.
In
middle
school
and
especially
in
high
school,
I
had
frequently
displayed
trenchant
insight
in
my
writing.
It
was
during
this
course,
however,
that
my
faculties
of
analysis
really
started
to
flourish.
The
second
difference
lay
in
the
degree
of
revising
that
I
would
do
at
the
end
of
each
paper.
Previously,
I
had
always
largely
sidestepped
this
stage
of
writing
(fortunately,
so
far
as
my
teachers
or
I
could
tell,
my
work
had
eluded
any
noticeable
detriment).
Yet,
because
of
the
sheer
difficulty
of
the
subjects
that
I
was
now
discussing,
I
had
no
choice
but
to
embrace
the
revision
process.
Out
of
necessity,
I
therefore
made
it
a
point
to
use
my
initial
drafts
simply
as
a
groundwork,
or
frame,
for
my
ideas.
It
was
only
when
this
groundwork
was
firmly
in
place
that
I
then
considered
how
to
go
about
polishing
and
refining
those
ideas.
This
frequently
involved
inserting
new
paragraphs,
tweaking
others,
and
shifting
information
from
place
to
place,
until
I
was
convinced
that
what
I
had
written
read
as
smoothly
as
possible.
By
the
semesterOs
end,
I
felt
as
confident
as
ever
in
my
ability
to
write.
After
all,
I
had
improved
not
only
in
thinking
analytically
about
the
arguments
that
others
posited,
but
in
considering
the
logic
of
my
own
thoughts
and
in
examining
the
manner
in
which
I
chose
to
express
them
on
paper.
But
I
still
wasnOt
satisfied.
In
spite
of
all
the
writing
that
I
had
done
and
all
the
praise
that
I
had
received,
I
couldnOt
tell
whether
I
had
finally
crossed
the
line
that
separates
amateur
writer
from
professional
one.
At
about
the
midpoint
of
the
following
semester,
however,
that
would
all
change.
[E]
The
paper
must
be
ready
by
now.
Lab
let
out
about
two
hours
ago.
As
I
made
my
way
toward
Oechsle,
I
could
detect
an
extra
bounce
in
my
feet.
I
was
anxious.
There
was
no
denying
that.
But
my
stomach
churned
with
the
excited
anticipation
of
favorable
tidings.
This
could
be
the
day.
Yes,
this
could
be
the
day
that
I
have
been
waiting
for
since
the
seventh
grade.
NHi,
Josh.
Sorry
to
keep
you
waiting.O
NNo
problem,
professor.
Just
hoped
you
liked
what
I
wrote.O
As
I
turned
the
pages
of
the
report,
my
eyes
scanning
the
comments
that
dotted
the
margins,
I
couldnOt
help
but
smile;
it
was
a
Duchenne
smile,
to
be
honest,
one
of
those
spontaneous
eruptions
of
pride
mixed
with
delight.
The
assignment,
after
all,
was
one
of
the
hardest
of
the
semester;
between
the
broadness
of
the
topic
(the
quality
of
childrenOs
television
programs)
and
the
voluminous
and
densely
packed
readings,
at
the
outset
I
had
wondered
how
I
would
fare.
Based
on
the
professorOs
remarks,
which
substantiated
and
objectified
my
own
thoughts,
I
fared
very
well.
Although
there
was
some
constructive
criticism,
the
suggestions
were
few.
By
and
large,
such
favorable
comments
as
Ngood
logical
development
of
intro.O
and
Nthoughtful
and
well-reasoned
discussionO
lined
the
paper.
A
moment
for
which
I
had
waited
so
long,
I
felt
that,
finally,
I
had
come
into
my
own
as
a
full-fledged
writer.
