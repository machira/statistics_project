Assignment
The
Road
to
Understanding
After
doing
a
thorough
examination
of
my
growth
as
a
writer,
reader,
peer
editor,
and
analyst
I've
learned
one
thing
to
be
for
certain:
introductory
paragraphs
have
not
gotten
any
easier
over
time!
But
I
can
say
that
this
assignment
has
required
me
to
dig
deep
down
into
my
memory
for
elements
of
my
growth
as
a
writer
that
I
would
never
have
remembered
otherwise,
and
has
proven
to
be
more
interesting
than
I
would
have
anticipated.
I
can
only
hope
that
by
realizing
how
intricate
my
own
personal
history
is,
and
reviewing
it,
I
will
have
an
increased
ability
to
understand
that
other
writers
also
have
a
personal
history.
So
having
said
all
of
this,
here
is
my
personal
literary
narrative.
I
attended
a
private
school
through
third
grade
and
the
earliest
writing
I
remember
doing
was
on
those
big
pieces
of
construction
paper
in
kindergarten.
At
that
time
it
seemed
like
the
pictures
on
the
page
outnumbered
the
words
and
I
could
barely
write
one
sentence.
To
illustrate
my
drawings
I
remember
using
those
extra
thick
pencils
and
even
crayons
at
times.
At
that
age
I
longed
for
the
day
when
I
could
use
the
regular
size
pencils
like
the
older
kids.
By
the
time
I'd
reached
first
and
second
grades
I
had
progressed
to
using
composition
books
with
lots
of
colorful
animals
on
the
front
cover.
At
that
time
I
was
just
learning
to
write
sentences
and
didn't
understand
what
a
paragraph
was.
Most
anything
I
wrote
that
year
was
about
red
balloons,
my
vacation
in
Florida,
or
my
favorite
animal
-
cats.
The
next
step
in
learning
to
write,
after
perfecting
my
printing,
was
cursive.
In
2nc*
and
3r(*
grade
we
had
lessons
where
we
learned
one
letter
a
week,
slowly
perfecting
the
lines
and
curves
of
the
letters.
In
my
effort
to
be
perfect,
I
used
to
look
at
the
writing
of
the
kids
sitting
next
to
me
to
see
how
theirs
looked.
I
was
more
concerned
about
how
pretty
my
cursive
was
than
the
content
of
my
sentences.
I
received
good
grades
because
I
was
able
to
reproduce
my
words
in
perfect
cursive.
Good
grades
and
pretty
writing
meant
everything
to
me
at
that
time.
I
switched
from
my
small
private
school
to
the
public
school
system
in
my
area
in
fourth
grade.
It
was
something
I
had
wanted
to
do
for
a
long
time.
At
Chatham
Park
Elementary
School
there
were
more
kids,
more
teachers,
and
more
opportunities
for
me
and
I
couldn't
have
been
happier.
Also,
around
this
time
my
dad
gave
me
my
first
computer.
It
was
the
first
model
that
Apple
Macintosh
ever
made.
It
couldn't
have
been
more
that
a
foot
and
a
half
tall
and
eight
inches
wide.
Compared
to
the
systems
today
it
was
practically
nothing,
but
it
was
the
most
important
thing
to
me.
The
feeling
I
got
from
being
able
to
tell
my
classmates
that
as
a
fourth
grader
I
had
my
own
computer
in
my
room
was
like
none
other
I'd
ever
had,
especially
since
computers
were
only
getting
to
be
a
big
thing
at
that
time.
I
probably
played
more
games
on
the
computer
than
I
wrote
papers,
but
it
was
still
mine.
I
didn't
really
start
using
it
for
school
assignments
until
later.
In
fifth
grade
I
started
typing
papers
for
classes
after
learning
to
type
in
school.
The
school
district
had
a
handful
of
computers
that
it
had
purchased
solely
for
the
students
to
learn
to
type
on.
The
lessons
included
stories
about
scuba
divers
and
airplanes
but
they
taught
us
all
how
to
type
in
the
process.
Later
that
year
I
wrote
my
first
paper.
This
doesn't
mean
I
had
never
written
a
paper
before
but
they
were
either
short
or
insignificant,
nothing
that
would
qualify
as
an
"essay".
It
was
my
first
at-home
book
report,
or
paper
for
that
matter,
about
a
book
we
read
in
class.
The
name
of
the
book
escapes
me,
but
I
will
always
remember
sitting
at
my
computer
typing
the
paper,
ripping
the
fringes
off
the
old
reamed
computer
paper,
stapling
it
together,
and
sitting
with
it
at
my
desk
in
class.
My
mom,
who
is
a
teacher
by
profession,
proof
read
it
for
me
the
night
before
to
find
grammatical
and
spelling
mistakes
that
I
had
made.
I
did
well
on
that
report
as
well
as
all
my
other
assignments
in
English.
I
took
such
pride
in
using
my
computer
that
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
perfecting
my
typing
and
writing
my
essays.
The
computer
became
a
very
important
component
when
it
came
time
for
me
to
write
a
paper
or
complete
a
project
from
then
on.
I
very
rarely
wrote
anything
out
by
hand
after
that.
I
can't
remember
all
of
the
essays
I
wrote
or
books
I
read
in
middle
school,
but
the
first
project
I
did
for
sixth
grade
English
will
forever
be
etched
upon
my
mind.
It
was
another
book
report
on
something
we
read
in
class
about
World
War
II,
except
for
this
essay
we
were
able
to
choose
the
style
in
which
we
presented
our
writing.
For
my
project
I
chose
to
write
my
report
in
the
form
of
a
newspaper
that
would
have
been
published
during
WWII.
I
wrote
the
report
and
several
other
"articles"
for
the
paper.
I
then
used
my
computer
to
set
up
the
articles,
paste
in
pictures,
and
even
included
headlines.
I
worked
so
hard
on
putting
it
together
and
was
so
incredibly
proud
of
my
work.
The
day
I
turned
it
in
the
teacher
read
through
it
and
had
me
stand
up
so
the
whole
class
could
see
how
well
done
my
project
was.
I
couldn't
stop
smiling
the
rest
of
the
day
and
felt
really
encouraged
about
my
capabilities.
From
what
I
can
recall,
most
of
the
work
I
did
in
middle
school
fell
along
the
lines
of
projects,
book
reports,
or
oral
reports.
Very
little
of
what
I
did
required
any
sort
of
analysis,
many
times
the
books
we
read
had
packets
with
questions
like,
"Who
told
the
story
about
the
dog?"
or
"Who
rode
the
boat
to
shore?"
and
all
you
had
to
do
was
put
the
correct
answer
in
a
complete
sentence.
Writing
assignments
had
begun
to
leak
into
other
subjects,
unlike
elementary
school
where
everything
was
very
separated.
I
remember
assignments
about
African
countries
for
Social
Studies,
mini
reports
for
math
class
on
different
mathematicians,
and
a
huge
research
paper
(about
seven
pages)
on
the
Battle
of
Gettysburg
for
History.
Also,
we
had
an
entire
class
devoted
to
typing.
This
time
it
focused
on
speed
and
accuracy,
plus
we
were
even
tested
and
graded
on
our
progress.
Throughout
middle
school
my
cutting
and
pasting
abilities
coupled
with
my
proficiency
in
using
a
computer
allowed
me
to
continually
get
good
grades
in
all
my
classes
-
and
I
expected
smooth
sailing
in
high
school
because
of
that.
When
I
reached
high
school
something
about
writing
changed,
and
it
took
me
quite
a
while
to
finally
correct
myself.
Maybe
it
was
the
fault
of
my
teachers,
or
my
own
fault,
or
maybe
just
bad
timing
-
but
somewhere
in
the
transition
I
didn't
understand
the
fact
that
I
had
to
switch
my
writing
from
a
superficial
book
report
style
to
a
more
analytic
style.
I
was
shocked
when
I
started
getting
B's
in
ninth
grade.
I
was
so
used
to
cutting
and
pasting
my
way
to
the
top
of
the
class.
I
didn't
realize
what
I
was
doing
wrong
or
how
to
fix
it.
Sadly,
my
pride
kept
me
from
asking
for
help
and
I
just
assumed
it
meant
I
was
a
poor
writer.
I
became
very
shy
about
my
writing
and
myself
around
that
time
and
from
then
on
very
rarely
allowed
anyone
to
read
my
papers,
unless
we
were
forced
to
do
"peer
editing"
assignments
in
class.
No
longer
did
I
have
my
mom
read
over
my
essays
or
boast
about
my
good
grades
because
I
just
figured
that
I
wasn't
an
"English
person".
In
tenth
grade
I
decided
I
didn't
like
getting
B's,
since
my
English
grade
seemed
to
lead
to
B's
in
other
classes,
so
I
worked
extra
hard
on
my
assignments
that
year
and
managed
to
get
straight
A's
in
all
my
classes.
However
I
still
never
let
anyone
read
my
papers
because
I
was
too
embarrassed.
That
year
we
focused
on
how
to
structure
an
essay,
write
analytically,
and
learn
more
about
grammar.
Each
of
our
papers
had
a
proper
heading,
title,
thesis
statement,
introduction,
body,
and
conclusion.
They
were
all
in-class
"timed
writings"
where
most
of
the
grade
was
about
how
well
one
followed
the
structure.
Looking
back,
though
tedious
at
times,
I
think
that
class
in
high
school
helped
me
most
to
learn
form
and
understand
the
steps
on
how
a
strong
essay
should
be
constructed.
I
learned
how
our
teacher,
Mr.
Hostetler,
wanted
us
to
structure
an
essay,
and
when
I
did
it,
I
got
my
A's
back
again,
which
was
very
important
to
me.
Change
was
coming
my
way
though.
At
the
beginning
of
eleventh
grade
I
took
"Honors
American
Studies".
It
was
a
class
that
combined
American
History
and
English;
it
was
twice
as
long
as
other
classes
and
had
two
teachers.
The
English
half
of
the
duo
was
Ms.
Whitney,
infamous
at
the
high
school
for
being
quite
strange
and
a
very
tough
grader.
She
also,
like
Mr.
Hostetler
in
tenth
grade,
had
a
certain
format
for
our
notes
and
papers;
she
told
us
to
forget
everything
we
had
learned
the
year
before
about
formatting
our
essays
a
certain
way.
We
still
focused
on
grammar
lessons
and
essay
structure,
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
the
year
before.
Unfortunately,
my
fear
of
proof
reading
still
remained
and
did
not
help
me
in
this
class.
I
reverted
back
to
getting
B's,
blaming
it,
of
course,
on
the
fact
that
Ms.
Whitney
was
a
tough
grader,
not
on
the
fact
that
I
refused
to
proof
my
own
papers
or
let
anyone
else
read
them.
Writing
assignments
for
that
class
were
mostly
analytical
about
things
read
in
class,
both
novels
and
historical
events
discussed.
Our
big
essay
for
the
year
was
a
double-major
grade
research
paper,
with
sources,
citations,
and
a
works
cited
page.
We
chose
our
topic,
did
all
the
research,
and
wrote
the
ten
page
paper
all
on
our
own.
I
unfortunately
chose
a
difficult
topic
to
write
about,
and
did
not
realize
it
until
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
through.
Too
scared
to
ask
for
help,
I
just
continued
writing
the
paper.
I
was
rather
upset
at
how
my
paper
turned
out
and
just
turned
it
in
anyway
without
much
editing.
Well,
I
got
a
58
on
that
paper,
and
it
counted
double.
Half
of
me
felt
excited
to
have
failed
something
in
my
life
because
I
was
a
perfect
honors
student
until
that
point
and
for
once
I
had
rebelled,
inadvertently,
but
still
rebelled.
The
other
half
of
me
was
scared
out
of
my
mind
to
tell
my
parents,
face
all
my
friends
who
did
well,
and
see
what
it
would
do
to
my
grade.
After
apologizing
to
the
teachers
and
telling
my
parents
I
realized
it
was
time
for
a
change,
I
didn't
need
any
more
scares
like
that,
especially
during
those
"important
college
acceptance"
years!
For
my
senior
year
of
high
school
I
opted
to
take
level
one
Humanities
instead
of
AP
English;
mostly
because
Humanities
was
nick-named
"Level
One
Cutting
and
Pasting"
and
that
was
always
something
that
was
right
up
my
alley.
Also,
at
the
same
time
I
was
taking
Senior
Project
-
the
course
everyone
was
required
to
take
in
order
to
graduate.
It
entailed
writing
a
12-15
page
paper
and
giving
a
10
minute
presentation
on
the
topic.
Writing
in
Humanities
seemed
to
reiterate
my
sentiments
about
myself
as
a
writer
for
the
last
few
years,
that
I
was
just
"ok"
and
not
an
"English
person".
My
writing
was
up
to
par
for
level
one
and
good,
but
not
something
that
would
stick
out
or
probably
be
remembered.
And
up
until
then
that
had
satisfied
me.
Somewhere
in
my
senior
project
class
something
changed.
Having
all
those
college
discussions
with
my
friends
started
to
worry
me
that
I
wouldn't
be
able
to
hold
up
in
a
college
writing
class.
Plus,
I
had
always
longed
to
be
one
of
those
people
whose
papers
"stood
out"
or
was
"exceptional".
So
from
then
on
I
made
a
conscious
effort
to
improve
my
writing.
I
listened
more
closely
to
suggestions
made
by
my
teachers
on
how
to
write
better.
The
first
change
I
made
was
to
write
my
essays
by
long
hand
first,
to
outline
and
get
my
thoughts
down
on
paper
instead
of
going
straight
to
the
computer
like
I
had
done
for
so
many
years.
Next,
and
this
was
the
most
difficult
part,
I
forced
myself
to
get
over
my
foolish
pride
about
others
reading
my
writing.
For
each
of
the
3
sections
of
my
senior
project
I
had
at
least
2
people
read
and
suggest
corrections.
It
made
me
nervous
each
time
but
I
still
did
it,
and
it
definitely
helped.
Finally
I
learned
to
read
and
critique
my
own
writing.
Though
it
may
seem
silly,
I
never
used
to
read
my
own
writing,
I
just
didn't
want
to.
By
the
end
of
senior
year
I
did
feel
there
was
a
vast
improvement
in
my
writing.
Whether
I'd
be
able
to
handle
college
level
writing
or
college
still
weighed
heavily
on
my
mind.
In
the
fall
I
finally
got
settled
at
school.
Much
was
made
of
the
FYS
class
so
I
put
a
lot
of
work
into
my
papers
for
that.
Throughout
my
FYS
I
kept
up
with
the
practice
of
having
several
people
critique
my
essays,
including
a
WA,
and
I
often
met
with
my
professors
to
discuss
them.
The
amount
of
preparation
I
did
in
high
school
prepared
me
well
to
write
on
the
college
level.
So
in
keeping
with
tradition,
I've
treated
this
essay
the
same
as
any
other
I've
written
-
outlining,
proof
reading,
and
editing.
Looking
back
I
realize
that
there
are
so
many
events,
both
big
and
small,
that
have
contributed
to
the
writer
I
am
today
-
some
things
not
even
English
related.
I
think
one
of
the
most
important
things
I've
learned
is
to
be
able
to
read
my
own
writing.
I
can
look
with
a
constructive,
not
too
critical
eye,
at
what
I've
written
and
ask
for
help
when
necessary.
I've
learned
to
keep
myself
open
to
hearing
the
ideas
and
comments
from
others.
Understanding
my
history
as
a
writer
makes
me
feel
pretty
good
to
see
how
far
I've
actually
come
and
see
also
where
I
can
still
go.
At
this
current
spot
on
that
road
I
have
the
opportunity
to
help
others
also
understand
their
histories
and
abilities
as
a
writer.
