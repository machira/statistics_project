When
It's
Not
Black
and
White
Frustration
is
the
first
word
that
comes
to
mind
when
I
think
about
my
last
year
as
both
a
writer
and
a
writing
associate.
Not
only
did
the
writing
projects
for
my
own
classes
grow
more
involved,
but
working
as
a
writing
associate
also
became
more
difficult
than
I
had
anticipated.
I
found
myself
thinking
more
and
more
about
the
complex
relationship
between
the
writer's
comprehension
of
the
assignment
and
the
material,
a
reader's
(writing
associate's)
comprehension
of
the
assignment
and
material,
and
the
finished
product
--
words
on
a
page
for
some
audience.
The
concept
of
audience
loomed
larger
than
it
had
before
as
my
time
as
an
EXCEL
assistant
forced
me
to
consider
what
it
meant
to
be
an
audience
but
not
necessarily
the
audience
for
which
a
piece
was
intended.
In
addition
to
these
growing
complexities,
I
struggled
to
work
with
one
lackluster
VAST
class
whose
apathy
and
(in
most
cases)
inferior
writing
skills
led
me
to
make
some
real
mistakes.
The
VAST
seminar
to
which
I
was
assigned
sounded
like
a
course
with
some
real
potential
to
engage
students
in
the
material
because
it
incorporated
writing
in
several
different
forms,
from
journals
to
traditional
papers
to
nontraditional,
creative
assignments.
The
sophomores
in
the
class,
however,
were
not
only
disinterested
in
the
topic
of
technological
change
across
time
but
also
seemed
incapable
of
saying
anything
substantive
in
their
papers.
The
first
writing
assignment,
for
example,
asked
students
to
write
about
their
own
experience
making
pottery
without
tools
and
to
use
their
experience
as
a
way
of
considering
the
issues
early
potters
faced.
After
a
brief
conversation
with
the
professor
about
the
assignment,
I
found
that
the
two
of
us
were
on
the
same
page
as
far
as
the
goals
of
the
assignment
were
concered:
what
observations
students
should
have
made
and
how
they
could
abstract
them
to
theorize
about
technological
change.
In
fact
(and
I
hope
not
to
sound
arrogant)
I
honestly
believe
that
I
could
have
completed
a
successful
paper
on
the
topic
without
any
background
other
than
the
assignment.
I
grew
frustrated
when
I
read
through
the
class's
papers
and
saw
that
few
did
more
than
scratch
the
surface
of
the
assignment
and
instead
attempted
to
get
away
with
restating
the
obvious
as
though
it
were
actually
analysis.
I
felt
fairly
confident
that
I
would
be
able
to
help
these
students
with
their
papers,
especially
since
the
professor
and
I
had
had
a
good
conversation
about
the
assignment.
But
what
I
failed
to
realize
was
that
there
is
a
difference
between
helping
students
organize
their
own
ideas
and
actually
helping
students
come
up
with
ideas
they
should
have
been
able
to
generate
on
their
own.
The
line
between
the
two
is,
at
best,
smudged.
Because
so
few
students
actually
made
any
substantive
observations
in
their
papers,
I
ended
up
leading
them
through
the
analysis,
continuously
hinting
at
what
observations
they
ought
to
be
have
made
and
what
conclusions
they
ought
to
have
drawn
from
those
observations.
Of
course
writing
associates
are
supposed
to
engage
writers
in
a
discussion
of
their
topics
and
to
help
those
writers
organize
their
thoughts
effectively.
But
what
happens
when
the
students
really
aren't
having
thoughts
--
or
at
least
useful
ones?
As
awful
as
it
may
sound,
very
few
students
in
the
seminar
understood
what
sort
of
observations
and
connections
they
were
supposed
to
make.
And
I
thought
the
assignment
was
easy
to
understand.
While
I
tried
very
hard
to
ask
good
questions
and
to
point
out
demonstratively
the
few
examples
of
relevant
observations
I
saw
in
their
papers,
I
felt
as
though
I
were
coaching
the
students
toward
proper
conclusions
and
affecting
the
content
of
their
papers
-
planting
ideas
in
their
heads
and
making
connections
for
them.
But
was
I
altering
the
thought
content
of
their
papers?
The
larger
question
here
is
how
to
define
content.
When
an
assignment
involves
analyzing
observations
and
drawing
conclusions
and
when
part
of
a
writing
associate's
job
is
to
see
that
students
properly
address
a
given
assignment,
how
does
a
writing
associate
help
students
who
just
don't
get
the
point
?
Almost
all
twenty
writers
in
this
VAST
class
neglected
to
understand
what
it
was
they
were
supposed
to
notice
about
their
pottery
experiences.
In
a
sense,
I
knew
the
answers
and
that
made
the
whole
process
even
more
frustrating
because
I
ended
up
trying
to
excavate
their
thoughts
and
to
tease
out
something
meaningful.
And
should
I
have
been
the
judge
of
what
was
meaningful?
How
much
can
you
help
them?
And
what
is
helping?
It
never
seemed
this
complicated
the
first
time
around.
Somehow,
as
a
veteran
writing
associate,
I
also
felt
more
responsible
for
the
quality
of
students'
work.
Ideally,
the
combination
of
more
experienced
writers
(in
this
case,
sophomores)
and
a
more
experienced
writing
associate
ought
to
have
produced
better
first
drafts,
better
conferences,
and
better
final
pieces
of
writing.
It
didn't
happen.
In
my
work
as
an
EXCEL
scholar
research
assistant,
I
faced
a
situation
the
seemed,
in
some
ways,
to
oppose
the
VAST
experience.
Rather
than
dealing
with
student
papers
that,
to
varying
degrees,
lacked
content,
I
helped
my
professor
finalize
a
paper
for
publication
--
a
paper
that
seemed
to
me
as
though
it
had
too
much
content
(or
at
ideas
beyond
my
complete
comprehension).
With
the
Chicago
Manual
of
Style
as
a
guide,
I
set
out
to
tinker
with
low-order
concerns
in
a
piece
of
my
professor's
writing,
a
chapter
of
his
dissertation
that
had
been
transformed
into
an
independently
publishable
paper.
While
checking
citations
and
pointing
out
his
split
infinitives,
I
was
supposed
to
learn
and
understand
the
content:
a
treatment
of
virtue,
morality,
and
other
mostly
boring
topics
from
seventeenth
century
theology.
I
had
great
difficulty
comprehending
the
material
and
often
had
to
reread
a
sentence
several
times
in
an
attempt
to
absorb
information.
While
I
wasn't
exactly
supposed
to
WA
his
paper,
he
did
want
feedback
beyond
simply
circled
grammatical
errors.
Since
my
professor
is
certainly
an
expert
in
his
field,
I
felt
awkward
discussing
his
writing
with
him.
Each
of
the
paragraphs
seemed,
to
my
novice
eye,
overwritten
--
as
though
his
points
were
bludgeoned
to
death.
But
in
this
case
I
wasn't
really
an
informed
reader
and
couldn't
detect
the
subtly
different
points
which
I'm
sure
each
successive
sentence
made.
The
assignment
in
this
case
exists
almost
entirely
in
the
mind
of
the
writer;
I
didn't
know
what
the
paper
was
supposed
to
do,
and
I
was
at
a
loss.
Still,
there
were
parts
of
the
paper
that
just
seemed
plain
awkward
or
out
of
sequence,
despite
the
fact
that
the
ideas
were
foreign
to
me.
The
question
the
experience
brought
me
to
is
this:
is
there
ever
a
point
at
which
writing
can
be
so
saturated
with
content
that
the
other
rules
of
good
writing
simply
can't
apply.
Can
ideas
become
so
complex
that
clear,
concise
prose
is
truly
impossible?
I
was
a
displaced
reader
--
not
sure
what
level
of
content
comprehension
was
expected
of
me
and
even
less
sure
how
free
I
was
to
question
the
presentation
of
the
material.
This
was
the
first
time
I
had
to
comment
on
and
make
suggestions
about
writing
when
I
didn't
feel
like
a
member
of
the
intended
audience.
The
whole
experience
left
me
a
little
confused
but
has
certainly
prompted
me
to
think
more
about
the
reader's
relationship
to
writing.
It
was
hard
operating
as
a
reader
who
felt
so
removed
from
the
subject.
It
was
also
hard
operating
as
a
reader
in
the
VAST
class
when
I
felt
I
knew
so
much
about
the
topic
that
I
had
trouble
restraining
myself
from
tinkering
with
students'
thoughts.
All
in
all,
the
year
raised
more
questions
than
it
answered.
While
often
disconcerting,
my
experiences
at
least
prompted
me
to
consider
the
extent
of
my
comfort
zone
as
a
reader
and
as
a
writer.
Even
as
I
write
this
assignment,
with
new
issues
to
consider
(i.e.
ownership
of
ideas,
not
being
part
of
the
writing's
audience)
I
think
differently
about
the
writing
process
than
I
did
just
a
year
ago.
It's
ironic
that
most
writing
is
in
black
and
white.
The
more
I
think
about
it,
the
grayer
it
gets.
