"We
all
thought
you
were
dyslexic!"
My
mom
laughs
now
as
she
tells
stories
of
my
early
attempts
to
write.
She
relates
how
I
would
not
only
write
letters
but
whole
words
and
sentences
backwards
from
right
to
left
across
the
page.
I
have
no
memories
of
my
backwards
writing,
only
the
stories
my
parents
relate
over
the
dinner
table.
Unfortunately,
no
one
seems
to
remember
when
my
writing
finally
turned
around.
Nearly
fifteen
years
later,
I
am
now
entering
my
sophomore
year
at
Lafayette
College.
I
have
grown
from
the
backwards
child
of
my
parents
stories
into
an
up
and
coming
mentor
of
other
writers.
My
writing
is
still
evolving,
but
it
has
come
a
long
way
already.
One
of
my
earliest
memories
of
writing,
and
one
of
the
earliest
surviving
samples
of
my
writing,
is
a
second
grade
project.
I
suppose
I
had
worked
out
most
of
my
earlier
troubles
with
writing,
because
the
sentences
and
words
read
correctly
from
left
to
right
with
the
exception
of
the
occasional
confusion
of
the
lowercase
"b"
and
"d."
In
second
grade,
an
"artist
in
residence"
came
to
my
elementary
school
to
teach
us
how
to
become
writers.
I
do
not
remember
his
name
or
what
he
wrote,
but
I
still
have
the
project
I
worked
on.
It
is
a
collection
of
short
stories
written
in
large,
awkward
pencil
letters
on
sheets
of
jumbo
sized
lined
paper.
The
pages
are
laminated
and
sandwiched
between
two
sheets
of
painstakingly
illustrated
cardboard.
Each
story
is
only
a
few
sentences
long
and
relates
adventures
of
bunnies
and
turtles.
I
delved
into
non-fiction
with
a
tale
of
my
annoying
little
sister.
I
am
amazed
now
to
see
the
thoughts
of
my
eight-year-old
mind
reflected
in
these
simple
words
and
sealed
in
airtight
sheets
of
plastic.
From
short
stories
I
progressed
to
third
grade
and
my
first
graded
writing
assignment.
I
had
to
write
a
research
paper
on
the
praying
mantis.
As
a
third
grade
class
with
little
writing
experience,
I
believe
the
point
of
this
assignment
was
more
to
learn
about
the
formal
writing
process
than
to
become
experts
on
our
assigned
insects.
Learning
and
carrying
out
the
steps
of
the
Oaks
Elementary
school
formal
writing
process
was
the
most
mind
numbing
and
torturous
exercise
of
my
elementary
school
carrier.
It
was
at
this
tender
age
of
nine
that
I
decided
I
would
rather
amputate
my
own
hand
with
a
dull
spoon
than
follow
my
third
grade
teacher's
plan
for
a
successful
paper.
We
went
to
the
library
to
take
notes.
Then
we
had
to
make
a
formal
outline.
All
those
roman
numerals,
capital
letters,
lowercase
letters
and
indentations
drove
me
crazy.
I
could
not
understand
what
getting
the
order
and
spacing
of
these
numbers
and
letters
correct
had
to
do
with
the
praying
mantis.
Besides
sparking
my
intense
loathing
for
the
formal
writing
process,
my
first
writing
assignment
had
little
impact
or
lasting
impression.
I
was
far
more
concerned
with
drawing
the
picture
for
the
cover
than
my
written
work.
Between
third
and
eighth
grades,
I
have
little
recollection
of
my
writing
experiences.
With
the
exception
of
the
occasional
history
report
or
summary,
I
do
not
believe
I
did
a
great
deal
of
writing.
Eighth
grade,
however,
brought
with
it
my
first
significant
experience
with
writing
and
analyzing
poetry.
Of
course
I
had
read
and
even
written
a
few
poems
before,
but
this
was
the
first
time
we
looked
at
poetry
in
depth
in
an
English
class.
I
discovered
that
I
really
enjoyed
writing
poetry,
but
I
really
hated
studying
and
analyzing
the
poetry
of
others.
Poetry
was
so
fascinating
to
me.
It
was
a
way
to
express
emotions,
thoughts,
desires,
and
observations
unhindered
by
the
rules
of
grammar.
Up
to
this
point
in
my
life
no
teacher
had
ever
bothered
explaining
or
teaching
the
rules
of
grammar
I
was
expected
to
follow,
so
poetry
was
a
pleasant
release
from
these
mysterious
rules
and
restrictions.
The
poetry
of
others
was
another
story.
My
poetry
sometimes
held
great
meaning,
but
sometimes
my
poems
were
nothing
more
than
an
interesting
compilation
of
words.
How
could
I
be
expected
to
know
the
difference
in
the
poetry
of
another?
I
hated
the
idea
of
forcing
my
own
meaning
onto
the
poetry
we
studied,
because
I
would
not
want
anyone
to
do
that
to
something
so
personal
to
me.
In
eighth
grade
I
both
started
and
stopped
writing
poetry
outside
of
my
school
assignments.
The
whole
concept
of
learning
about
and
analyzing
poetry
annoyed
me
so
deeply
that
I
just
could
not
enjoy
writing
it.
My
resolve
to
avoid
poetry
as
often
as
possible
led
me
back
to
my
foremost
difficulty
with
prose:
I
had
absolutely
no
knowledge
of
the
rules
or
technical
terms
of
English
grammar.
What
little
grammar
I
picked
up
came
from
a
most
unusual
source.
I
learned
more
about
the
English
language
in
four
years
of
high
school
German
than
I
learned
in
all
my
years
of
English
classes.
In
order
to
speak
and
write
a
foreign
language,
like
German,
it
is
important
to
learn
how
the
grammar
rules
differ
from
the
way
we
write
and
speak
in
English.
My
German
teacher
would
often
begin
a
lesson
by
telling
us
what
English
grammatical
concept
corresponded
with
our
new
lesson.
Her
face
would
contort
as
she
stared
at
us
in
disbelief
when
not
one
person
in
the
room
would
have
any
idea
what
English
concept
she
was
discussing.
For
four
years
she
struggled
to
teach
us
about
our
own
language
in
order
to
give
us
some
chance
of
understanding
hers.
Along
with
my
first
significant
doses
of
grammar,
high
school
brought
with
it
my
first
organized
study
of
literature
and
styles
of
writing.
In
eleventh
grade
I
was
taught
the
evolution
of
early
American
literature.
Until
this
point
in
my
education,
teachers
tossed
around
terms
and
categories
with
no
apparent
order.
Our
studies
were
so
random
that
the
concepts
were
quickly
forgotten.
The
moment
my
pencil
hit
the
desktop
after
a
test,
my
brain
would
empty
itself
of
any
knowledge
of
the
topics
we
had
just
learned.
My
eleventh
grade
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Giambrone,
was
a
bitter,
man-hating,
over-the-hill
divorcee.
Her
condescending
glares
could
humble
even
the
most
outrageous
of
the
class
clowns.
She
crammed
the
evolution
of
American
literature
into
our
brains
with
all
five
foot
two
inches
and
one
hundred
fifteen
pounds
of
her
might.
She
attended
every
conference
and
in-service.
We
were
guinea
pigs
for
every
new
educational
style
of
teaching
and
testing.
With
or
without
the
new
tricks
of
the
trade,
her
task
was
much
like
trying
to
force
a
square
peg
in
a
round
hole.
Despite
the
uphill
battle,
she
did
her
best.
She
was
the
only
English
teacher
I
can
remember
that
seemed
to
have
some
kind
of
organization
and
larger
picture
in
mind
as
she
taught.
We
discussed
how
new
styles
of
writing
emerged
in
America
in
chronological
order.
Her
class,
while
difficult
and
less
than
enjoyable
at
the
time,
was
a
breath
of
fresh
air
in
comparison
with
the
mindless
reading
assignments
accompanied
by
pointless
comprehension
questions
of
English
teachers
past.
Mrs.
Giambrone
was
by
no
means
my
favorite
teacher
or
most
influential
teacher.
I
have
always
had
a
deep
loathing
for
English
classes
and
English
teachers
in
general,
so
even
the
best
of
my
English
teachers
are
rather
far
down
on
my
overall
list
of
greatest
teachers.
Once
again,
however,
her
name
sticks
out
as
I
remember
one
of
the
largest
and
most
meaningful
research
papers
I
have
ever
written.
Our
assignment
was
simply
to
write
a
paper
that
can
somehow
be
related
to
a
piece
of
literature
or
multiple
pieces
of
literature
of
our
choice.
The
assignment
appeared
vague
at
first,
but,
as
usual,
she
had
an
elaborate
plan
and
rigid
time
schedule
to
keep
her
troublesome
and
irresponsible
eleventh
graders
on
task.
I
could
feel
the
tension
building,
swelling
to
an
ear
piercing
forte
in
the
orchestra
of
my
mind
as
she
uttered
those
hated
words
of
third
grade,
"Your
outlines
will
be
due
on..."
I
winced
with
pain
at
the
thought
of
the
hideous
outline
that
was
forced
upon
me
in
third
grade.
Not
only
did
this
new
assignment
include
an
outline,
it
also
included
an
elaborate
system
of
index
cards
and
note
taking.
Despite
the
horrors
of
the
intermediate
due
dates,
I
managed
to
find
a
topic
that
I
enjoyed
studying
to
ease
some
of
my
pain.
My
paper
examined
different
perspectives
of
World
War
II
as
illustrated
in
a
variety
of
works
of
fiction.
I
do
not
remember
my
thesis
statement
or
my
final
grade,
but
I
remember
feeling
proud
of
the
words
I
had
written.
It
may
not
have
been
my
most
brilliant
writing
samples,
but
it
was
defiantly
my
most
meaningful.
After
Mrs.
Giambrone
came
AP
English
and
the
horror
better
known
as
the
five
point,
or
five
paragraph,
essay.
This
twelfth
grade
English
class
forced
me
to
strip
my
writing
down
to
a
bare
minimum.
My
palms
still
get
clammy
at
the
thought
of
that
frantic
race
against
the
clock.
We
had
only
thirty-five
minutes
to
write
exactly
five
paragraphs
to
answer
one
question.
I
scribbled
as
fast
as
my
little
hand
could
tolerate
as
the
minutes
slipped
away.
Each
time
an
independently
read
book
was
due
the
sheets
of
black
line
paper
would
circulate,
passing
from
hand
to
hand
with
solemn
expressions.
The
stack
grew
even
smaller
as
pages
feel
away,
like
grains
of
sand
pouring
from
an
hourglass
to
count
down
seconds
to
out
demise.
Somehow
this
torture
prepared
me
for
the
AP
exam
well
enough
to
be
exempted
from
English
110
at
Lafayette
College.
I
am
not
sure
if
I
hate
formal
outlines
or
five
point
essays
more,
but
at
least
the
essays
earned
me
college
credit.
I
thought
that
is
was
very
interesting
that
the
topic
of
the
five
paragraph
essay
cam
up
during
my
freshman
orientation
at
Lafayette.
The
topic
arose
during
the
orientation
session
where
the
writing
associate
program
was
explained.
I
do
not
remember
the
exact
question
posed,
but
the
writing
associate
speaking
explained
that
we
should
under
no
circumstance
turn
in
a
five
paragraph
style
essay
for
any
type
of
college
writing
assignment.
Was
this
true?
Could
it
be
that
all
the
stress
and
anxiety
I
so
desperately
fought
to
perfect
my
simple
little
five
point
essay
was
now
wasted
effort?
What
exactly
was
the
point
of
the
AP
English
test
if
it
measure
writing
ability
on
the
basis
of
a
from
of
writing
not
acceptable
at
the
college
level?
In
my
first
year
at
Lafayette,
I
did
not
write
a
single
five
point
or
five
paragraph
essay.
I
wrote
exactly
three
papers.
I
suppose
their
organization
was
loosely
based
on
the
essay
format
so
engrained
in
my
mind,
but
they
were
far
superior
to
anything
ever
squeezed
out
in
thirty-five
minutes.
The
only
papers
I
wrote
ym
freshman
year
of
college
were
for
my
first
year
seminar,
or
FYS
class.
I
loved
my
FYS
class.
It
was
entitled
"The
Uses
and
Abuses
of
Science
in
Science
Fiction."
As
an
aspiring
biochemist
that
was
never
partial
to
English
classes,
I
was
thrilled
that
my
only
writing
course
would
revolve
around
science,
my
true
passion.
We
discussed
fascinating
topics
of
astrophysics
and
the
universe.
We
questioned
the
possibilities
of
life,
time
travel,
and
the
transporter
that
made
Star
Trek
famous.
My
papers
explored
the
modem
scientific
fact
that
support
or
dispute
the
fictional
plot
lines
and
adventures
of
the
movies,
books,
and
television
programs
we
studied.
I
did
not
write
a
single
formal
outline
or
index
card.
I
was
finally
given
the
chance
to
develop
my
writing
in
my
own
way
on
my
own
time
schedule.
These
assignments
were
also
a
great
release
from
the
long
and
tedious
freshman
biology
lab
reports
I
trudged
through
each
week.
My
FYS
class
brought
back
the
energy
and
excitement
about
writing
that
I
had
not
experience
since
the
eleventh
grade
paper
I
was
so
proud
of.
I
finally
realized
that
while
I
despised
analyzing
poetry,
I
loved
exploring
the
realities
and
possibilities
of
fictional
prose.
Although
I
was
not
aware
of
it,
my
love
of
exploring
the
blurring
of
fact
and
fiction
in
writing
has
been
growing
since
a
very
young
age.
There
is
one
source
that
has
affected
me
evolution
as
a
writer
more
deeply
than
any
teacher
or
class.
It
does
not
fit
in
one
place
in
a
chronological
order,
because
it
is
an
ongoing
learning
experience.
For
as
long
as
I
can
remember,
I
have
loved
to
read.
As
a
child,
my
mom
signed
up
for
a
"Weekly
Reader"
program,
so
every
week
I
received
a
couple
of
books
in
the
mail.
They
never
seemed
to
arrive
fast
enough.
For
me,
books
have
always
been
like
potato
chips.
I
can
never
readjust
one.
As
a
child,
I
read
everything
from
Newbery
Medal
winning
children's
books
to
the
Babysitter's
Club
series.
I
read
"Hamlet"
for
the
first
time
in
seventh
grade.
I
did
not
understand
all
of
it,
but
if
it
was
written
I
was
determined
to
read
it.
Although
I
would
never
admit
it
to
my
peers,
I
even
enjoyed
many
of
the
novels
I
had
to
read
for
English
classes
in
high
school.
In
addition
to
fiction,
I
read
biographies
and
true
stories.
Fact,
fiction,
or
any
combination
of
the
two
fed
and
continue
to
feed
the
unceasing
appetite
of
my
mind.
Regardless
of
subject
matter,
the
books
I
read
taught
me
how
to
write.
I
many
not
be
able
to
analyze
the
parts
of
speech
of
a
sentence
or
explain
the
rules
of
English
grammar,
but
my
mind
is
familiar
with
the
flow,
structure,
and
style
of
the
things
I
have
read.
Writing
is
an
art
form.
Like
many
fine
arts,
memorizing
and
following
the
rules
are
not
enough
to
become
a
great
artist.
A
young
musician
may
know
every
note
his
instrument
can
produce,
but
notes
alone
are
meaningless.
The
best
musicians
listen
to
music
as
well
as
understand
it.
There
is
something
about
the
emotion
of
a
world-renowned
orchestra
performing
a
symphony
that
seems
to
left
the
notes
off
the
page
and
let
them
soar.
In
the
same
way,
there
is
something
about
writing
that
is
not
captured
in
the
rules
of
"The
New
St.
Martin's
Handbook."
Many
brilliant
orchestrations
of
the
written
word
exist,
and
they
offer
more
to
the
aspiring
artist
than
any
list
of
notes
or
rules
alone.
My
background
in
writing
is
by
no
means
intensive
or
extensive.
Despite
my
somewhat
informal
influences,
I
have
managed
to
grow
from
awkward,
laminated
stories
to
careful,
typewritten
explorations
of
college
level
subject
matter.
(Although
I
have
to
admit,
I
still
enjoy
writing
from
right
to
left
once
in
awhile
to
impress
my
friends.)
In
the
coming
years,
I
hope
I
will
have
many
new
and
positive
experiences
to
fill
the
gaps
in
my
past
education
and
forge
the
way
for
further
advancements.
Most
importantly,
I
will
keep
reading
and
learning
from
the
works
of
artists
who
have
come
before
me.
