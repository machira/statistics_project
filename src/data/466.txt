Literacy
Narrative
As
I
sat
down
to
write
this
literacy
narrative,
I
realized
that
I
had
never
actually
thought
back
to
the
early
days
of
my
writing.
Some
of
the
earliest
memories
that
I
have
of
my
writing
are
the
letters
that
I
used
to
write
to
my
grandmother
as
a
little
kid.
Some
time
ago
I
managed
to
go
through
some
of
these
letters,
since
my
grandmother
continues
to
keep
all
the
letters
and
cards
that
I
have
ever
written
to
her.
I
always
wrote
my
letters
with
multi-colored
pens,
and
with
all
my
alphabets
of
different
sizes.
My
sentences
were
also
often
not
very
well
constructed,
and
the
language
that
I
used
was
always
very
simple.
It
was
a
very
interesting
experience
for
me
to
see
how
I
used
to
write
as
a
child.
Another
thing
that
I
remember
is
that
in
the
initial
years
of
elementary
school,
we
used
to
write
in
ruled
notebooks.
In
these
notebooks,
everything
we
wrote
was
in
between
an
elaborate
set
of
lines,
so
that
we
learnt
to
form
our
alphabets
correctly.
I
also
used
to
practice
writing
in
notebooks
with
such
lines
outside
of
school,
in
order
to
try
to
improve
my
handwriting
(Unfortunately
I
have
always
had
problems
with
my
handwriting,
because
of
which
the
advent
of
computers
has
really
benefited
me!).
During
the
initial
years
of
elementary
school,
I
also
wrote
a
lot
in
Hindi
(my
native
language)
in
school.
After
writing
for
a
while
in
notebooks
with
the
special
kinds
of
lines,
we
slowly
graduated
to
writing
in
notebooks
with
regular
ruled
sheets.
One
other
recollection
that
I
have
of
the
early
days
of
my
writing
is
the
implement
that
we
used
in
school
for
writing.
Until
about
grade
5,
we
were
allowed
to
write
only
with
pencils.
In
grade
5,
we
were
for
the
first
time
allowed
to
start
using
pens
to
write,
and
this
had
created
a
great
deal
of
excitement
among
all
of
us.
Almost
everything
I
wrote
during
my
years
in
school
was
also
handwritten,
and
not
typed
on
either
a
typewriter
or
computer.
I
did
my
schooling
in
India,
and
in
Indian
schools
writing
skills
are
not
given
much
importance,
since
the
emphasis
is
more
on
technical
subjects
such
as
Mathematics
and
the
Sciences.
Therefore,
in
school
I
did
not
do
too
many
writing
assignments,
and
was
not
able
to
experiment
much
with
various
writing
forms.
As
a
result
I
did
not
get
much
practice
or
experience
in
writing,
and
was
not
able
to
develop
my
writing
skills
to
the
extent
that
I
would
have
liked.
Though
we
did
learn
some
different
writing
forms
during
our
English
classes,
such
as
writing
newspaper
reports
and
articles,
writing
formal
and
informal
letters,
journals
etc.,
most
of
these
were
short
writing
assignments
and
not
emphasized
in
the
overall
school
curriculum.
Therefore,
I
was
never
really
taught
about
the
different
genres
of
writing
in
school
(In
fact
I
never
even
knew
that
such
a
word
existed
in
the
English
vocabulary
until
I
came
across
it
while
studying
for
my
SAT).
I
had
also
never
really
written
any
long
research
papers
or
other
such
academic
forms
of
writing
for
any
of
my
courses
in
school.
I
had
however
written
some
short
economics
research
papers/articles
in
high
school.
Writing
these
was
a
great
experience
for
me,
and
I
also
learnt
a
lot
from
them
since
they
were
probably
my
first
experience
in
writing
any
research
based
papers.
Despite
the
fact
that
writing
skills
were
not
emphasized
in
my
school,
I
always
enjoyed
the
writing
that
I
did
do.
However,
I
was
always
a
little
under
confident
about
my
writing
skills,
some
of
it
possibly
due
to
the
fact
that
I
never
had
too
much
experience
in
writing,
and
was
therefore
never
very
sure
about
what
exactly
was
expected
of
me
in
a
writing
assignment
and
if
I
had
correctly
interpreted
what
I
was
supposed
to
do.
However,
one
of
the
factors
that
led
to
an
increase
in
my
confidence
over
the
years
was
the
fact
that
my
teachers
always
gave
very
positive
comments
to
whatever
I
had
written.
This
always
delighted
me.
Even
at
times
when
I
was
extremely
unsure
about
certain
pieces
of
my
writing,
my
teachers
were
usually
very
happy
with
it.
This
resulted
in
my
slowly
becoming
more
confident
and
less
unsure
about
my
writing.
My
increasing
confidence
also
resulted
in
an
improvement
in
my
writing
skills,
and
also
made
it
much
easier
for
me
to
write.
One
thing
that
I
clearly
remember
is
that
I
never
liked
showing
my
writing
to
friends
or
family.
I
always
felt
extremely
embarrassed
and
awkward
whenever
a
classmate
or
family
member
read
anything
that
I
had
written.
This
was
probably
because
of
the
fact
that
I
was
never
sure
if
what
I
had
written
was
good
enough.
Another
thing
that
always
terrified
me
was
my
writing
being
read
aloud
by
someone.
When
read
aloud,
I
always
got
the
feeling
that
what
I
had
written
made
no
sense.
Some
of
these
feelings
of
not
wanting
to
have
my
writing
read
aloud,
or
read
by
family
or
friends
still
exist,
although
nowadays
I
donOt
mind
my
pieces
of
academic
writing
being
read
by
others.
However,
I
still
feel
very
awkward
when
it
comes
to
personal
pieces
of
writing.
I
have
found
that
for
me
the
worst
part
of
writing
a
piece
is
beginning
with
it.
I
always
find
it
very
hard
to
begin
writing
a
piece
since
at
that
time
I
either
have
no
idea
about
what
to
write,
or
I
only
have
a
lot
of
jumbled
information
in
my
mind
which
I
donOt
know
how
to
organize
into
a
piece
of
writing
that
would
read
well.
However,
I
find
that
once
I
actually
start
writing
something,
my
various
thoughts
fall
into
place
and
organize
themselves.
I
have
therefore
now
realized
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
under
confidence
that
I
used
to
feel
about
my
writing
was
because
of
the
uneasiness
that
I
feel
while
writing
the
initial
parts
of
any
piece
of
writing.
However,
I
now
know
that
if
I
objectively
read
what
I
have
written
after
finishing
a
piece
of
writing,
I
will
usually
be
very
happy
with
it.
One
of
the
times
when
I
actually
wrote
a
lot
of
essays,
and
tried
to
improve
my
writing
skills,
was
while
I
was
preparing
for
my
SAT
II
writing
test.
This
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
I
actually
practiced
writing
essays.
I
also
showed
a
lot
of
these
to
my
parents
in
order
to
get
their
comments
so
that
I
could
improve.
This
was
therefore
also
the
first
time
that
I
showed
pieces
of
my
writing
to
my
parents.
My
parents
were
very
impressed
with
my
essays,
and
this
also
led
to
an
increase
in
my
level
of
confidence.
I
discovered
that
though
very
often
while
writing
something
I
wondered
if
it
was
making
any
sense,
by
the
end
it
usually
made
complete
sense.
After
writing
all
these
essays
while
preparing
for
my
SAT
II
writing
test,
I
began
to
feel
much
more
confident
about
my
writing
skills.
After
it
was
certain
that
I
was
going
to
come
to
the
US
for
my
under
graduation,
I
was
a
little
apprehensive
about
the
kind
of
writing
that
I
would
be
required
to
do
in
colleges
in
the
US.
I
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
colleges
in
the
US
place
a
lot
of
emphasis
on
writing
skills,
and
that
the
other
students
who
would
have
studied
in
schools
in
the
US
would
probably
have
had
much
more
experience
than
me
in
writing
papers,
as
well
as
other
kinds
of
writing
that
they
would
have
been
required
to
do
in
school.
I
therefore
felt
that
it
was
possible
that
my
writing
skills
would
be
a
little
less
developed
than
those
of
the
other
students.
Some
of
the
things
that
especially
worried
me
were
the
kind
of
papers
that
I
would
be
expected
to
write,
formats
expected
of
students
when
writing
papers,
citing
sources,
etc.
I
expected
that
all
the
other
students
would
already
know
such
things
because
of
having
done
them
in
their
schools.
I
also
expected
that
the
writing
standard
expected
of
students
would
be
very
high,
and
was
not
sure
if
my
writing
standard
was
up
to
the
mark.
One
of
the
first
papers
that
I
wrote
at
Lafayette
was
for
my
First
Year
Seminar:
The
European
Union
and
the
Surrender
of
Sovereignty.
I
was
a
little
nervous
when
I
began
to
write
this
paper,
and
frequently
consulted
the
St.
MartinOs
Handbook
in
order
to
learn
things
such
as
the
format
for
citations.
I
also
asked
my
professor
and
my
WA
some
of
the
questions
that
I
had
regarding
my
paper.
Even
though
I
had
worked
really
hard
on
writing
the
first
draft
of
my
paper,
I
did
not
know
what
to
expect
when
I
handed
in
this
first
draft
to
my
professor
for
her
comments.
However,
once
I
got
back
my
paper
with
my
professorOs
comments,
my
anxiety
regarding
my
writing
skills
decreased
by
a
considerable
extent
and
I
also
realized
that
I
was
on
the
right
track
in
writing
my
paper.
After
I
finished
writing
the
paper,
I
also
realized
that
I
had
really
enjoyed
the
entire
process
of
writing
it.
Two
of
my
courses
during
my
first
term
at
Lafayette:
Introduction
to
Political
Theory
and
my
First
Year
Seminar,
involved
a
lot
of
writing.
All
the
writing
required
for
these
courses
reaffirmed
to
me
the
fact
that
I
really
enjoy
writing.
Since
I
also
did
well
in
these
courses,
my
confidence
in
my
writing
skills
also
increased
significantly.
I
realized
that
even
though
I
had
not
had
too
much
practice
in
writing
papers
etc.,
my
writing
skills
were
up
to
the
mark,
and
even
improving
as
I
wrote
more
and
more
papers.
In
addition,
I
also
learnt
a
little
about
some
of
the
different
genres
of
writing.
For
my
Introduction
to
Political
Theory
course
I
had
to
write
theory
papers,
for
which
our
professor
explained
to
us
how
theory
papers
are
written
and
also
gave
us
handouts
on
this.
In
my
First
Year
Seminar
course
as
well,
I
learnt
how
to
write
research
papers,
persuasive
essays,
as
well
as
other
types
of
papers.
I
really
enjoyed
the
entire
process
of
writing
all
these
papers
and
also
learnt
a
lot
while
writing
them.
I
probably
enjoy
writing
academic
papers
more
than
non-academic
ones,
although
I
donOt
really
have
much
experience
in
writing
non
academic
papers.
I
feel
that
my
writing
skills
have
developed
significantly
in
my
one
year
at
Lafayette.
Discussing
my
papers
with
my
WA
and
professors
helped
me
to
improve
the
aspects
of
my
writing
that
needed
improvement.
It
also
helped
me
organize
my
paper
and
give
it
a
certain
structure
so
that
the
ideas
flowed
from
one
line
to
the
next.
I
consider
this
to
be
one
of
the
strong
points
of
my
writing
skills,
and
aim
to
write
papers
in
which
the
language
is
simple
and
clear,
and
the
paper
is
organized.
I
also
realized
that
critically
analyzing
what
I
had
written
in
my
paper
and
revising
it
after
writing
a
first
or
second
draft,
always
helped
me
improve
it
significantly.
It
was
also
only
at
Lafayette
that
I
first
started
using
computers
for
writing
all
my
papers,
which
was
something
that
I
had
never
done
for
my
courses
in
school.
Writing
on
a
computer
has
a
very
different
feel
to
it
than
writing
things
with
a
paper
and
pen.
However,
it
makes
the
process
of
writing
a
lot
easier
since
it
enables
one
to
make
changes,
as
well
as
add,
delete,
rearrange
things
etc.,
in
a
paper.
Initially
I
did
have
a
tendency
to
first
write
out
my
paper
by
hand
and
then
type
it
out,
but
I
very
soon
overcame
this
and
became
comfortable
with
directly
typing
out
everything.
In
conclusion,
I
believe
that
my
writing
skills
have
evolved
by
a
considerable
extent
ever
since
I
first
began
to
write,
especially
in
the
very
recent
past.
Although
I
have
always
enjoyed
writing,
I
was
not
able
to
do
much
of
it
for
most
of
my
years
in
school.
It
was
only
recently
that
I
started
writing
regularly
D
first,
when
I
practiced
writing
essays
for
my
SAT
II
writing
exam,
and
then,
much
more
importantly,
the
papers
I
wrote
in
my
one
year
at
Lafayette.
The
writing
that
I
have
done
at
Lafayette
has
made
me
sure
of
the
fact
that
I
really
enjoy
writing.
I
was
also
able
to
improve
and
develop
my
writing
skills
by
an
enormous
extent.
By
doing
well
in
the
papers
that
I
wrote,
my
confidence
regarding
my
writing
skills
has
also
increased
manifold.
Lafayette
has
therefore
made
a
great
impact
and
difference
to
my
writing
skills.
This
has
culminated
in
my
being
able
to
become
a
Writing
Associate
in
the
coming
semester.
Even
in
the
future,
I
hope
to
continue
to
be
able
to
develop
and
improve
my
writing
skills
by
learning
from
my
experiences
as
a
WA,
as
well
as
from
the
papers
that
I
will
write
for
my
future
courses.
