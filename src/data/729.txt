The
Writing
Process
Chris
1.
Brainstorming
Writing
is
a
process
that
is
unique
to
every
author.
Everyone
gets
an
empty
paper
or
word
document
and
fills
it
in
a
distinctive
manner
to
fulfill
their
personal
goal.
Writing
allows
for
freedom
and
open
interpretation.
I
personally
also
find
it
to
be
a
great
reflective
tool,
which
can
be
used
to
remember
events
of
my
past.
Writing
is
an
elaborate
process
which
can
yield
fulfilling
results
if
given
the
proper
time
and
motivation.
IOve
always
found
beginning
a
paper
to
be
the
most
interesting
and
important
part
of
writing.
When
you
get
an
assignment
or
a
prompt,
there
are
many
different
ways
you
can
approach
it.
This
freedom
is
both
empowering
and
overwhelming.
IOve
found
myself
in
test
taking
situations
in
college
where
I
take
a
good
while
going
over
the
prompt
in
my
head
and
formulating
ideas
before
ever
beginning
to
write.
This
can
be
nerve-racking
when
you
see
your
peers
racing
through
and
you
have
yet
to
start.
Still,
this
thought
process
beforehand
is
crucial
in
giving
your
paper
a
clear
and
decisive
direction.
IOm
a
believer
that
a
paper
can
be
made
or
broken
by
the
thoroughness
of
the
preparation
that
comes
before
writing
it.
Once
everything
has
been
written,
itOs
very
difficult
to
go
back
as
a
writer
and
change
something
fundamental
about
the
paper.
Having
good
ideas
and
initial
thought
processes
are
two
crucial
aspects
to
the
success
of
a
writer.
My
writing
experience
dates
back
to
pre-school,
where
NwritingO
assignments
comprised
of
mimicking
the
pencil
strokes
of
my
teacher
after
she
transcribed
my
daily
thoughts.
We
had
consistent
exercises
in
the
correct
formation
of
letters
and
from
those
letters
we
advanced
to
words
and
sentences.
I
can
remember
spending
hours
as
a
three-year-old
writing
each
letter
in
lower
and
upper
case
hundreds
of
times
to
get
the
idea
ingrained.
From
these
basic
beginnings
itOs
crazy
to
think
of
the
numerous
difficult
steps
I
now
take
to
complete
writing
assignments
at
the
college
level.
ItOs
a
long
journey
from
sloppy
scribbles
to
research
papers
exceeding
20
pages
in
length.
Writing
in
my
youth
was
a
relatively
simple
process.
It
involved
gathering
information
and
regurgitating
it
in
an
order
that
made
sense
and
proved
a
point.
At
the
most
basic
this
meant
literally
repeating
exactly
what
my
teacher
wrote,
to
the
best
of
my
three-year-old
ability.
Writing
was
meant
as
a
means
to
an
end,
not
the
elongated
process
that
I
now
use
in
college.
In
elementary
and
middle
school
we
only
learned
about
the
basic
structure
of
papers.
Not
until
I
entered
high
school
was
there
a
semblance
of
organizing
and
connecting
ideas
to
form
a
cohesive
work.
The
beginning
years
were
merely
building
blocks
for
the
more
challenging
assignments
I
would
face
in
the
future.
2.
Writing
Even
in
high
school,
writing
was
still
a
relatively
simple
activity.
Most
assignments
involved
reading
a
story
or
passage
and
giving
some
basic
literary
analysis.
On
the
more
serious
papers
there
might
be
some
teacher
feedback,
but
it
was
usually
the
case
that
once
something
was
written,
it
was
gone
and
you
didnOt
have
to
worry
about
it
anymore.
As
a
lazy
high
school
student,
this
was
very
convenient,
as
I
could
just
put
in
a
few
hours
of
work
and
never
have
to
worry
about
an
assignment
again.
What
I
learned
a
few
years
later
is
that
this
leads
to
poor,
half-hearted
writing.
This
phenomenon
of
writing
as
a
single
event
wasnOt
troubling
at
the
time,
but
it
is
bothersome
now.
I
do
remember
that
as
I
got
older,
more
and
more
teachers
would
try
to
get
their
students
to
space
out
their
writing,
with
some
even
offering
students
the
opportunity
to
resubmit
their
papers
with
the
possibility
of
a
better
grade.
Although
this
defeats
the
purpose
of
a
set
deadline,
in
my
mind
it
makes
a
lot
more
sense
than
the
alternative.
A
good
piece
of
writing
can
always
be
improved,
and
educators
should
allow
their
students
the
opportunity
to
improve
their
work.
While
still
in
high
school,
one
of
my
favorite
writing
memories
was
when
I
was
a
junior
and
I
was
practicing
for
the
SATOs.
As
part
of
this
practice,
my
tutor
made
me
practice
the
essay
portion
many
times,
since
the
writing
section
was
one
of
my
weakest.
I
loved
the
process
of
getting
a
prompt,
having
examples
ready
in
my
mind,
and
finding
a
good
way
to
juxtapose
examples
to
prove
a
point.
All
of
that
had
to
happen
in
a
very
short
time
span,
and
it
really
forced
me
to
be
creative
and
witty
on
the
spot.
That
practice
really
helped
me
grow
as
a
writer
in
a
time
when
it
really
needed
to
happen,
right
before
college.
The
transition
to
college
writing
mainly
focused
on
gathering
credible
information
and
building
on
individual
bits
of
information
to
form
a
complete
argument
or
idea.
In
the
FYS
program
freshman
year
I
was
challenged
to
reexamine
the
sources
of
my
information
and
came
to
understand
that
this
would
only
help
with
the
strength
and
credibility
of
my
papers.
IOve
been
blessed
to
grow
up
in
this
advanced
technological
age.
It
allows
for
a
multitude
of
great
resources
which
are
easily
accessible.
After
improving
my
information
gathering
strategy,
I
switch
my
focus
to
the
process
of
writing,
which
is
the
biggest
difference
from
high
school
to
college.

Feedback
Once
in
college,
I
quickly
learned
that
writing
a
paper
is
only
the
beginning
of
an
arduous
but
rewarding
process.
Throughout
high
school,
the
sequence
was
to
submit
a
paper
and
receive
a
grade,
rinse
and
repeat.
In
college,
professors
hold
their
students
to
a
higher
standard.
TheyOre
aware
that
quality
writing
doesnOt
usually
all
come
in
one
session.
Using
that
knowledge,
the
writing
process
in
college
involves
lots
of
feedback
and
tinkering
with
ideas
based
on
that
feedback.
This
also
allows
for
more
than
one
person
to
have
input
on
a
paper,
which
can
only
be
helpful.
The
time
schedule
of
these
reviews
and
changes
also
helps
with
writing
as
a
reflective
act.
In
my
experience,
taking
time
off
before
editing
a
piece
can
be
very
helpful
in
terms
of
getting
a
better
perspective
on
the
overall
goal
of
a
piece.
While
during
the
original
writing
period
I
might
be
fixated
on
putting
in
all
of
the
pertinent
information,
after
taking
a
week
or
so
off,
I
can
trim
a
lot
of
dead
weight
off
of
a
paper
and
make
it
more
concise
and
powerful.
Going
into
college,
I
expected
mainly
similar
writing
in
terms
of
difficulty,
just
with
substantially
longer
papers.
Growing
up
with
older
cousins
and
friends,
I
heard
the
horror
stories
of
people
staying
up
all
night
grinding
out
20
page
papers.
I
expected
to
be
pounded
with
hours
upon
hours
of
writing
without
much
actual
substance.
What
transpired
in
college
didnOt
exactly
meet
my
expectations.
The
reality
of
college
writing
is
that
the
assignments
are
long
and
challenging,
but
with
the
proper
effort
they
are
very
manageable.
Knowing
how
to
budget
time
and
properly
use
resources,
two
skills
quickly
mastered
in
college,
helps
a
lot
with
writing
college
papers.
A
longer
paper
can
be
made
much
simpler
by
breaking
it
down
into
parts
and
then
piecing
them
together
after
some
reflection.
I
wasnOt
expecting
this
to
be
the
process
going
into
college,
but
the
skills
I
learned
my
first
year
made
this
strategy
a
very
obvious
choice.
The
challenge
in
writing
for
me
is
usually
just
motivation.
Once
you
begin
writing
and
the
ideas
start
to
flow,
pages
fly
by
and
papers
become
easy.
Given
the
proper
direction,
college
writing
is
relatively
simple.
I
believe
that
the
WA
program
at
Lafayette
has
been
very
successful
in
terms
of
getting
students
to
focus
on
structure
and
flow.
ItOs
assumed
that
by
this
point
students
can
find
and
articulate
all
the
right
information.
The
program
in
my
experience
has
focused
more
on
making
the
paper
more
reader
friendly,
and
not
just
a
bunch
of
jumbled
ideas.
IOve
had
times
at
Lafayette
where
IOve
had
good
information
and
strong
arguments,
but
the
paper
was
not
successful
because
what
made
sense
to
me
wasnOt
understood
by
my
reader.
The
WA
program
works
to
remedy
this
problem,
and
has
helped
me
a
lot
through
my
three
years
at
Lafayette.
For
this
reason,
IOm
very
happy
to
have
the
opportunity
to
give
back
to
the
college
in
form
of
helping
other
students
with
their
writing.
The
Lafayette
method
of
students
helping
other
students
works
because
both
sides
have
so
much
in
common
that
itOs
easy
to
communicate
goals
and
come
up
with
a
roadmap
for
a
successful
paper.
The
WA
program
is
a
helpful
resource
provided
by
Lafayette
that
truly
facilitates
college
writing.
One
of
my
favorite
aspects
of
college
writing
is
the
variety
of
work
that
it
brings.
With
courses
ranging
many
disciplines
and
languages,
no
two
writing
assignments
are
ever
the
same.
IOve
found
that
keeping
a
record
of
my
previous
work
is
very
useful
for
growth
and
reflection.
In
college,
IOve
found
that
professors
can
give
varying
feedback,
and
that
sometimes
advice
can
apply
not
only
to
individual
papers,
but
to
my
writing
process
on
the
whole.
Having
professors
who
are
solely
focused
on
the
needs
of
their
students
has
been
very
helpful.
IOve
never
felt
more
comfortable
asking
for
input
or
writing
tips.
The
professors
at
Lafayette
are
quick
to
help
when
help
is
needed,
and
are
very
observant
in
terms
of
seeing
student
improvement
and
overall
writing
quality.
4.
Editing
and
Finishing
Recently
IOve
been
lauded
for
my
thoughtful
analysis
in
my
writing.
This
is
feedback
that
I
donOt
often
get,
and
is
especially
moving
when
it
comes
from
a
college
professor
with
hundreds
of
students.
The
fact
that
I
was
hand
chosen
for
this
position
shows
a
lot
of
progress
in
my
writing
prowess.
Back
in
high
school,
I
might
have
thought
IOd
be
a
tutor
for
math
or
science,
but
never
writing.
It
was
always
something
I
was
good
at,
but
I
would
never
list
it
as
one
of
my
strengths.
This
feedback
came
as
a
pleasant
surprise;
itOs
always
nice
to
be
noted
for
your
critical
thinking.
For
my
final
year
in
college,
IOm
striving
to
get
more
similar
comments.
IOll
have
plenty
of
opportunity
as
IOm
both
writing
a
thesis
in
economics,
and
taking
writing
intensive
courses
in
Spanish
at
the
same
time.
This
year
will
finally
be
an
opportunity
to
reveal
my
own
writing
style
at
length.
I
find
that
as
I
grow
older,
I
enjoy
school
and
learning
more
and
more.
This
is
most
evident
in
my
enjoyment
of
college
courses.
In
my
three
years
at
Lafayette,
I
would
say
that
IOve
enjoyed
a
good
majority
of
my
courses
and
a
good
part
of
that
is
due
to
professor
involvement
and
attitude
towards
writing
assignments.
Whichever
class
IOve
been
a
part
of;
my
professors
have
always
had
an
open
mind
towards
writing
assignments,
giving
students
extensions
if
necessary
and
providing
tons
of
extra
office
hours
to
make
sure
all
student
concerns
are
covered.
Besides
these
other
helpful
habits,
professor
feedback
is
extremely
useful.
In
one-on-one
meetings
with
professors
IOve
come
up
with
some
of
my
best,
most
creative
ideas.
Their
advice
has
had
a
great
influence
on
my
writing
process.
My
entire
schooling
life
has
in
some
way
involved
building
and
molding
my
writing
style.
From
the
basics
in
my
youth
to
the
actual
process
in
college,
it
has
all
provided
me
with
a
means
to
express
myself
and
communicate
my
ideas.
I
look
forward
to
the
writing
process
taking
a
more
prevalent
role
in
my
life
this
coming
year.
I
feel
that
IOm
well
prepared
for
whatever
challenges
may
arise.
I
feel
that
I
have
the
motivation
and
more
than
enough
free
time
to
devote
myself
to
being
a
good
writer.
