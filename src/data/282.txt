WA
Literacy
Narrative
"So--you're
an
Art
History
major.
Are
you
a
junior
or
a
senior?"
Actually.
.
.
no.
And
neither.
Feeling
relieved
at
the
end
of
one
of
my
first-ever
WA
conferences,
these
questions
threatened
my
newly
constructed
confidence;
there
I
sat--critiquing
papers
on
subjects
virtually
foreign
to
me,
offering
advice--as
a
sophomore.
But
as
the
semester
passed
by,
along
with
many
hours
spent
in
Pardee
319,
I
stopped
questioning
the
authority
that
had
been
bestowed
upon
me.
On
a
good
day,
after
eleven
o'clock
in
the
morning,
I
can
recite
the
twenty
most
common
writing
errors--verbatim--illustrating
with
examples
and
citing
exact
page
references
to
the
two
most
recent
editions
of
the
St.
Martin's
Handbook.
Granted,
such
moments
of
clarity
are
few
and
far
between,
but
even
betwixt
those
fleeting
glimpses
of
utter
genius,
I
still
know
what
I'm
talking
about.
Yes,
I
know
the
rules
of
writing--and
heartily
encourage
most
students
in
WA
conferences
to
conform
to
them,
all
the
while
believing
that
most
great
writers
reveal
their
brilliancy
through
a
complete
disregard
for
regulation.
But
then
again--if
Baldwin
elects
to
use
the
dash
profusely--and
with
reckless
abandon--his
readers
can
rest
assured
that
such
unorthodoxy
is
a
result
of
choice--not
ignorance.
That
CHOICE--during
my
two-semester
stint
as
a
WA--has
become
the
cornerstone
of
my
writing
associate
philosophy.
Each
writer
approaches
the
same
assignment
differently,
and
regardless
of
my
own
opinions
and
evaluations
of
that
approach,
my
work
is
to
ensure
that
it
(to
clarify
this
indirect
reference,
the
"it"
refers
back
to
the
writer's
approach)
is
based
on
conscious
decisions.
At
first
I
was
surprised--and
disappointed--to
read
an
incoherent
draft
only
to
discover
in
its
creator
a
fluent
and
articulate
conversationalist.
Often
the
written
work
was
plagued
by
superficial
errors
because
the
writer
lacked
options
and
resources
to
efficiently
express
(note:
split
infinitive)
his
thoughts.
Upon
realizing
this,
I
ceased
making
marginal
notes
about
vague
pronoun
references
(see
1-15
in
St.
Martin's
Handbook)
and
began
asking
more
questions
about
the
writer's
purpose:
can
you
explain
this
sentence?
How
does
this
statement
relate
to
your
others?
To
your
thesis?
How
are
you
going
to
tie
these
ideas
together?
Then--I
let
the
writer
speak.
Words
would
flow
that
belonged
on
the
pages--and
often
those
words
fell
from
the
writer's
lips
in
grammatically
correct,
error
free
sentences.
Naturally
these
questions
flowed
from
my
conferences
with
other
writers
into
my
own
work--thus
burdening
me
with
what
has
on
occasion
become
a
painfully
slow
writing
process.
Yet
I
bear
this
burden
somewhat
nobly--
pondering
each
punctuation
mark
with
the
knowledge
that
if
I
were
Herman
Melville,
surely
I
would
use
a
semi-colon
that
seemed
to
make
no
sense
and
the
word
"verdant;"
while
if
I
were
Mark
Twain
I
would
eliminate
seventy-three
percent
of
my
adjectives
and
simply
say
"green."
Regardless
of
these
ramblings,
I
am
neither
of
these
writers
and
am--as
a
result--faced
with
my
own
writing
choices--a
fact
made
known
to
me
through
my
work
as
a
Writing
Associate.
On
one
notable
night
this
past
spring
semester,
I
was
struggling
through
the
introductory
paragraph
for
an
assignment
with
the
help
of
another
WA.
Due
to
modern
technological
advances,
this
conference
took
place
over
instant
messenger--with
me
pasting
and
sending
the
problematic
sentences
through
cyberspace
and
awaiting
his
suggestions.
After
forty-one
minutes
of
conferencing
and
questioning,
three
words
were
eliminated
from
that
troublesome
paragraph,
one
altered,
and
one
period
converted
into
a
semicolon.
My
trial
had
passed
and
I
was
left
praising
the
patience
and
dedication
of
a
WA
who
took
the
time
to
help
me
figure
out
what
I
was
trying
to
say--and
the
best
way
to
say
it.
Aware
of
the
time
constraints
of
being
a
WA
and
the
frustration
of
receiving
a
pile
of
one-page
drafts
as
material
for
upcoming
conferences,
I
attempted
to
maximize
my
experiences
with
my
VAST
Writing
Associate.
A
particularly
hectic
week
preceded
the
deadline
to
hand
in
the
WA
draft--and
I
became
that
student--the
one
who
tries
to
disguise
a
three-page
work
in
progress
with
no
introduction
as
a
rough
draft
of
an
actual
paper.
Realizing
my
negligence,
I
worked
on
my
outline,
my
notes,
and
brought
these
materials
with
me
to
prove
to
my
WA
that
I
really
had
thought
about
this
assignment.
She
was
quite
understanding--admiring
my
six-page,
single
spaced
outline
and
raising
questions
about
the
direction
of
my
paper
based
on
the
sneak-preview
she
had
read
earlier.
Because
of
her
willingness
to
work
with
the
materials
on
hand
and
my
willingness
to
ponder
sections
of
the
paper
that
at
the
time
had
no
physical
form--we
were
both
rewarded
with
a
productive
conference.
Armed
with
my
preliminary
work,
I
exited
Pardee
319
realizing
that
a
conference
can
be
successful
when
it
probes
the
areas
of
a
paper
yet
to
be
written.
Another
useful
lesson
began
in
a
staff
meeting
with
an
article
whose
title
and
author
probably
escaped
my
memory
before
the
conclusion
of
that
meeting.
Fortunately,
the
article's
message
remained
and
silently
invaded
my
conferences--literally.
According
to
this
article
students
fail
to
answer
questions
(or
answer
them
inadequately)
because
their
questioners
never
allow
enough
response
time--disturbing
the
necessary
reflection
period
with
more
questions
intended
to
clarify
the
original
question.
Basically--conferences
don't
produce
answers
when
the
questioner
does
nothing
but
beat
the
student
over
the
head
with
question
after
question
after.
.
.
.You
get
the
point.
So
did
I--but
one
of
the
hardest
things
for
me
to
learn
was
to
be
comfortable
with
partially
silent
conferences.
Instead
of
the
barrage
of
Inquisition-style
interrogatives,
I
try
to
ask
ONE
question
that
receives
a
follow-up
clarifier
only
upon
the
student's
request.
This
is
a
difficult
technique
for
me,
but
it
forces
the
student
to
consider
his
writing
thoughtfully
and
prevents
me
from
forcing
my
own
words
into
someone
else's
work
just
to
fill
up
that
pervasive
silence.
Too
often
writers
attend
conferences
with
me
expecting
to
find
a
proofreading
service--easy,
simple-minded
corrections
that
are
organized
by
topic
in
St.
Martins.
Sometimes
this
is
necessary,
but
the
primary
concern
of
the
Writing
Associate
should
be
helping
a
writer
find
his
own
voice
to
fill
the
silence
of
the
conference
and
the
blank
pages
before
him.
In
an
ideal
world
that
voice
is
projected
in
grammatical
and
standardized
English,
but
in
this
less-than-Utopia
that
we
struggle
through,
it
is
enough
to
show
each
writer
the
merits
of
coherently
constructing
his
individual
voice.
Despite
reading
Art
History
papers
for
two
semesters--often
on
the
same
subjects--I
was
not
bored
when
the
writers
discussed
their
ideas
because
each
of
them
chose
a
different
means
of
reaching
the
same
end.
This
concept
has
become
sharpened
through
my
work
as
an
EXCEL
Scholar
this
summer.
For
the
past
nine
weeks
I
have
perused
works
written
by
Herman
Melville,
about
Herman
Melville,
to
Herman
Melville,
and
works
that
simple
correspond
with
Herman
Melville's
career.
At
this
point,
I
am
filled
to
the
brim
with
Herman
Melville
and
wondering
what
I
can
contribute
to
a
topic
so
diligently
studied
for
the
last
century.
But
as
I
read
over
my
notes
and
my
primary
text,
I
find
myself
disagreeing
with
the
statements
of
others,
expanding
upon
their
ideas,
accepting
some
and
rejecting
others--all
the
while
formulating
my
own
perspective.
Maybe
I
am
audacious
to
believe
that
my
voice
is
something
fresh,
but
it
seems
that
the
sagacious
King
Solomon
may
have
been
presumptuous
in
claiming
"nothing
new
under
the
sun."
A
new
voice,
a
new
approach--when
reading
twenty-some-odd
papers
on
the
same
topic,
the
innovative
writing
stands
out--and
is
greatly
appreciated.
Before
becoming
a
Writing
Associate
I
never
considered
this
aspect
of
making
my
writing
a
fresh
experience
for
the
reader--a
concept
that
has
been
reinforced
by
my
summer's
work.
No
Melville
critic
will
be
published
for
repeating
the
statements
of
his
predecessors,
which
explains
my
professor's
urgings
to
search
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
bibliographies
of
other
critics--
to
probe
undiscovered
sources,
to
examine
the
holes
and
the
flaws
of
existing
arguments
so
that
he
can
contribute
something
new,
something
fresh
to
his
field
of
research.
Upon
returning
to
Lafayette
this
fall,
these
techniques
will
play
an
even
greater
role
in
my
own
writing,
as
I
explore
the
literary
works
and
criticism
of
Mark
Twain
and
try
to
place
my
own
voice
within
that
topic.
My
primary
advice
to
first-time
Writing
Associates:
LISTEN.
One
question
can
lead
the
entire
conference
to
a
productive
conclusion--although
usually
additional
questions
(always
delivered
after
answers
are
received!)
are
necessary.
Let
the
writer
talk--because
the
words
that
appear
upon
the
page
before
you
are
only
a
small
sample
from
another
writer,
one
piece
from
a
jigsaw
puzzle
of
one
thousand
pieces.
So
ask
questions,
the
kind
of
questions
that
lead
into
other
questions,
and
listen
as
the
voice
of
an
individual
writer
emerges
from
a
page
of
standard
black
ink.
