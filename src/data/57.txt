My
Literary
History
My
literary
history
started
early,
thanks
to
Dad.
Though
he
didn't
become
a
writer,
the
rare
degree
in
Literature
he
earned
made
him
believe
in
the
divinity
of
writing.
Therefore,
his
favorite
son
should
write
early
and
write
well.
However,
this
literary
road
is
far
from
easy
for
me.
The
details
of
my
first
encounter
with
writing
is
too
far
away
for
me
to
remember,
though
it
has
a
deep
impact
on
me.
It
is
literally
writing"--my
first
contact
with
a
pencil
and
beginning
to
write
and
draw
on
a
piece
of
paper.
However,
probably
because
of
Dad's
influence,
I
had
this
notion
from
the
very
beginning
that
good
writing
is
another
word
for
a
good
student,
which
is
what
I
had
always
wanted
to
be.
I
clearly
remember
that
soon
after
entering
school,
I
became
one
of
the
first
few
students
who
were
allowed
to
write
with
a
pen
instead
of
a
pencil,
because
of
our
good
handwriting.
The
real
writing
experience
began
when
I
was
in
Grade
Two.
One
day,
Dad
brought
home
an
exquisitely
embroidered
notebook
and
told
me
that
was
a
present
for
me--my
diary
book.
I
was
really
excited.
The
feeling
of
filling
the
book
with
my
own
writing
is
so
enticing
that
I
couldn't
wait
to
take
out
my
pen
and
write
down
the
date
and
began
my
first
piece
of
diary.
For
several
days,
I
would
take
out
the
book
from
my
drawer
several
times
a
day
just
to
read
my
diary
and
enjoy
it.
Sometimes
I
even
had
the
impulse
to
write
several
pieces
a
day.
The
excitement
kept
on
for
almost
a
week.
Then,
things
changed.
My
entries
in
the
diary
are
almost
the
same:
school-home-school.
I
felt
bored.
Even
at
that
age,
I
knew
that
it's
senseless
to
write
about
the
same
thing
over
and
over.
what
a
stupid
idea
to
write
diaries!
I
said
to
myself.
Dad
soon
became
aware
of
the
problem.
Obviously
he
was
worried
about
my
poor
ability
to
observe
life.
Often
he
would
tell
me
how
to
find
things
special
in
life
that
were
worth
writing
down.
Did
you
write
about
your
friend
Xiao
Liang's
breaking
my
flower
pot
while
playing
hide-and-seek?
What
about
Zhu
Rong's
leaving
town
for
another
school?
Sometimes,
in
order
for
me
to
have
some
good
experiences
to
write
about,
he
would
even
take
me
travelling.
However,
no
matter
how
hard
Dad
tried,
I
still
had
difficulty
finding
things
to
write
about.
My
entries
of
diary
become
fewer
and
fewer,
and
the
typical
piece
of
diary
would
be
like
this:
Jan
24th
Wednesday
rainy
Today,
Father,
Mother
and
I
went
to
the
zoo.
We
saw
elephants,
birds
and
bears.
It's
a
lot
of
fun.
On
the
way
back.
I
had
a
big
ice-cream.
Things
didn't
become
better
as
time
went
by.
In
Grade
5.
we
were
required
to
write
a
weekly
journal,
which
was
due
every
Monday.
The
teacher
would
praise
the
good
ones
and
even
read
certain
passages
of
the
good
journals.
Probably
because
I
had
been
a
good
student
in
other
subjects,
I
was
very
eager
to
be
heard
.
Every
Monday
afternoon,
I
would
sit
in
my
seat
and
anxiously
wait
for
the
teacher
to
come
into
the
classroom.
With
a
thin
stack
of
good
journal
books
in
her
hand,
the
teacher
would
come
in
and
start
reading
aloud
the
list
of
names.
How
I
wished
I
was
in
it!
And
yes,
I
was
often
on
the
commendation
list.
However,
behind
this
was
work
that
no
one
else
could
think
of.
I
don't
remember
exactly
how
it
happened,
but
Dad's
fascination
with
writing
was
definitely
an
important
factor--it
somehow
became
a
rule
for
me
to
show
my
journal
to
Dad
for
his
comments
every
Saturday
morning.
This
is
not
merely
a
commenting
process.
If
after
reading
my
journal,
Dad
nodded
his
head,
it
meant
that
I
did
OK.
He
would
then
point
out
some
minor
problems
with
my
writing,
but
I
will
definitely
have
a
good
and
easy
weekend.
However,
if
as
Dad
read
my
journal,
he
began
to
wrinkle
his
eyebrows,
I
knew
that
my
weekend
was
over.
The
number
of
times
he
wrinkled
his
eyebrow
indicated
how
bad
my
journal
was(in
his
eyes).
Usually
it
would
be
about
half
an
hour's
comment
why
my
journal
was
not
good
enough
and
how
I
could
improve
it.
I
would
sit
there,
trying
to
appear
that
I
was
listening
to
him
while
at
the
same
time
thinking
about
how
unlucky
I
was,
what
I
could
do
if
Dad
liked
my
journal
and
how
my
friends
were
enjoying
their
weekend.
After
the
commenting
period,
I
would
have
to
go
back
to
my
room
and
redo
the
journal.
Usually,
the
bad
mood
Dad's
comments
caused
in
me
would
persist
the
whole
day.
I
would
sit
there,
being
angry
with
Dad
and
myself.
I
would
try
hard
to
remember
what
Dad
had
said
about
my
journal
but
usually
could
recall
only
fifty
percent.
After
the
rewriting,
the
ordeal
is
not
over.
I
had
to
show
the
second
version
to
Dad.
That's
the
time
I
was
most
nervous.
Dad
would
be
really
angry
when
he
found
out
that
I
hadn't
really
listened
to
his
comments.
Then
a
second
revision
would
be
necessary.
It
went
on
and
on
until
Dad
was
satisfied
with
what
I
had
written.
But
the
real
trouble
is
that
deep
down,
I
didn't
have
a
clear
idea
what
is
good
writing
and
what
is
not.
Dad's
teachings
and
comments
are
not
bad,
but
I
was
too
young
to
understand
and
few
actually
went
into
my
mind,
and
that
was
far
from
enough
to
enable
me
to
write
well.
Basically,
I
was
trying
to
write
things
that
I
thought
Dad
and
the
teacher
would
like.
But
it
was
almost
a
wild
guess.
Sometimes,
I
would
bring
to
Dad
a
piece
of
journal
thinking
that
I
have
to
write
it
again,
while
Dad
was
so
pleased
with
it
that
he
would
take
me
to
a
movie
as
a
prize.
More
times,
things
were
just
the
opposite.
The
same
thing
happened
in
school.
I
clearly
remember
that
one
of
my
journals
was
about
the
flowers
Dad
raised
in
the
yard.
The
teacher
liked
it
so
much
that
she
read
it
to
the
whole
class
and
commented
on
a
sentence
I
wrote
the
rose
is
waiting
to
blossom.
She
said
this
sentence
is
good
because
it
showed
my
good
observation,
She
had
observed
flowers
about
to
blossom
and
she
had
exactly
the
same
feeling.
Sitting
in
the
classroom,
I
was
totally
red.
That
is
not
from
my
observation
at
all.
I
was
writing
and
the
sentence
just
came
to
me!!!
This
kind
of
chaos
in
writing
continued
for
some
time.
I
was
on
the
first
part
of
my
literary
road,
stumbling.
However,
I
have
to
admit
that
through
the
stumbling
experience,
I
am
beginning
to
have
a
grip
of
writing,
an
understanding
of
the
basics
of
writing,
a
vague
but
important
view
of
what
is
good
writing
and
what
is
not,
at
an
extremely
slow
and
inefficient
pace.
Things
began
to
change
after
I
entered
high
school.
It
seemed
like
overnight
I
began
to
like
writing,
though
I
understand
it
was
not
the
case.
Suddenly
I
found
that
I
had
things
to
write
about.
I
began
to
THINK!!
I
saw
things
as
usual,
but
what's
more
important,
I
began
to
think
why
and
how.
The
world
around
me
was
not
only
the
physical
world
itself,
it
had
meaning
in
its
mere
existence.
I
thought
about
life,
about
what
kind
of
life
I
was
going
to
have
when
I
grew
up.
All
the
thinking
in
fact
encouraged
me
to
write,
to
express
my
thought.
Suddenly
I
was
no
longer
bothered
by
the
fact
that
I
didn't
have
enough
to
write
about.
I
began
to
consider
how
I
could
make
my
writing
better
and
make
my
ideas
better
understood.
Through
writing,
I
was
actually
expressing
my
thought
about
the
world
and
trying
to
prove
to
other
people
that
my
ideas
are
correct,
or
at
least,
make
sense.
In
a
way,
the
writing
has
become
a
touchable
form
of
my
thought.
The
more
I
wrote,
the
more
I
liked
writing.
High
school
was
also
the
time
when
I
began
to
learn
English.
Writing
in
English
didn't
cause
me
as
much
trouble
as
writing
in
Chinese.
After
I
had
a
pretty
good
mastery
of
the
vocabulary
and
grammar,
I
didn't
have
much
difficulty
in
writing.
It's
still
the
expression
of
ideas,
just
in
another
form.
However,
soon
I
found
a
problem:
I
could
clearly
express
myself,
but
that's
the
level
I
could
get
to.
It
seemed
that
my
English
writing
skill
was
not
improving.
Dad
didn't
know
English
at
all,
but
he
still
gave
me
his
suggestion:
read!
This
time,
I
listened
to
his
advice.
I
began
to
read
a
lot
of
English
novels
and
articles.
At
first,
I
had
read
them
in
order
to
improve
my
writing
skills.
But
soon,
I
was
enjoying
the
contents
of
these
English
books
so
much
that
I
was
no
longer
thinking
about
writing
and
read
just
because
I
wanted
to
read.
Soon
I
found
I
was
beginning
to
have
a
feeling,
or
sense
of
the
English
language.
When
I
wrote
in
English,
this
feeling
let
correct
English
flow
from
my
finger
tips.
The
first
year
in
the
USA
is
a
test
of
my
confidence
in
English
writing.
The
notion
that
I
would
have
to
write
as
well
as
American
students
scared
me
a
lot
at
first.
But
the
first
year
seminar
and
first
year
writing
helped
me
to
build
up
my
confidence.
For
the
first
year
seminar
I
chose
law
and
literature
,
which
I
am
interested
in
and
which
is
also
a
challenge
for
me.
The
challenge
is
real--I
got
a
C+
for
my
first
paper.
But
I
knew
what
was
wrong.
There
are
some
rules
for
academic
writing
that
I
never
knew
before.
For
the
next
few
papers,
I
did
pretty
well.
The
real
confidence
is
from
my
first-year
writing
course
in
the
second
semester.
Our
first
assignment
is
five
page
paper,
but
I
wrote
ten.
It
was
about
something
I
am
very
familiar
with
and
which
I
have
so
many
feelings
about.
Sitting
in
front
of
the
computer,
I
just
couldn't
stop.
The
structure
of
the
whole
paper
became
clearer
and
clearer
to
me
as
I
wrote.
Sometimes,
as
I
was
typing
certain
sentences,
something
new
and
exciting
will
jump
into
my
mind
and
I
just
couldn't
wait
to
write
it
down.
From
time
to
time,
I
made
typing
mistakes,
but
in
order
not
to
interrupt
my
thought,
I
just
kept
on
typing
and
took
care
of
the
typos
when
the
whole
paper
was
done.
It
took
me
to
nights
to
finish
the
ten
page
paper
and
I
was
anxious
to
people's
reaction
to
it.
I
had
some
doubt
about
the
length
of
the
paper:"is
it
too
wordy?"
The
professor's
comments
are
very
encouraging:
it
is
a
very
good
paper,
and
it
is
worth
its
length.
I
can
write
as
well
as
American
students!
that's
what
I
said
to
myself
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
writing
course.
And
now
I
am
a
writing
associate!!!
