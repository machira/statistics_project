About
four
years
old,
dressed
in
Osh
Kosh
B'Gosh
overalls
and
new
white
Keds
sneakers,
I
stood
at
the
wall
of
the
public
library
looking
up
at
the
various
construction
paper
colors
of
cut
out
dinosaurs.
I
found
the
yellow
one
that
read,
"Lauren
Gilbert"
and
excitedly
pointed
it
out
to
my
mom.
She
held
me
up
so
I
could
take
my
dinosaur
and
move
it
further
along
the
make-believe
forest
on
the
wall.
I
was
excited
because
my
name
was
now
among
the
dinosaurs
furthest
along.
From
a
young
age,
my
parents
began
reading
to
me
every
night
before
bed.
It
was
one
of
my
favorite
times
of
the
day
and
I
was
so
enthusiastic
about
reading,
that
often
times
the
books
lulled
my
parents
to
sleep
before
me.
As
a
response
to
my
obvious
interest
in
reading,
my
mom
enrolled
me
in
the
public
library
summer
reading
program.
Each
summer
had
a
theme
and
every
time
my
mom
and
I
completed
a
certain
number
of
books,
I
was
able
to
move
my
name
to
a
new
spot
on
the
wall,
seeing
how
I
compared
to
the
other
kids.
When
I
reached
certain
points
along
the
way,
I
was
able
to
receive
a
small
prize.
The
reading
program
served
as
a
bond
between
my
mom
and
me,
as
well
as
an
incentive
to
read.
Although
I
was
too
young
to
truly
understand
my
likes
and
dislikes,
my
parents
could
see
that
I
loved
books.
They
knew
they
had
a
responsibility
to
cultivate
my
knowledge
and
interest.
My
journey
as
a
writer
began
with
an
intense
love
for
reading.
Personal
ambition
and
self-induced
pressure
drove
me
to
read
and
write.
Every
Friday
in
Mrs.
Polakowski's
first
grade
class,
we
would
end
the
day
with
a
spelling
bee
in
preparation
for
the
weekly
spelling
tests
on
Monday.
I
took
the
spelling
bees
seriously,
not
out
of
a
sense
of
competition,
but
rather,
for
personal
satisfaction.
I
became
very
hard
on
myself
and
frustrated
when
I
had
trouble
mastering
the
correct
spelling
of
a
word.
Over
the
weekend,
any
free
time,
such
as
long
car
rides
or
bath
time,
was
made
into
a
spelling
quiz.
I
would
make
my
parents
quiz
me
incessantly
until
I
knew
I
could
go
into
the
Monday
test
confidently.
If
a
student
spelled
all
the
words
correctly
on
the
test,
he
or
she
could
select
a
prize.
While
other
kids
chose
erasers
or
funky
pens,
I
almost
always
selected
an
old
book
my
teacher's
teenage
daughter
had
donated
to
the
prize
stash.
My
mom
would
tease
me
when
I
came
home
from
school
on
Mondays
because
I
was
excited
to
have
a
ratty,
tom
book
to
add
to
my
collection.
At
the
time,
she
did
not
realize
the
significance
of
those
books.
They
introduced
me
to
various
authors
and
styles
and
inspired
me
to
read
and
write
on
my
own.
I
graduated
from
Mrs.
Polakawski's
class
and
moved
on
to
Mrs.
Colavita's
second
grade
class,
where
my
writing
was
further
developed.
Outside
of
Mrs.
Colavita's
classroom
hung
nineteen
pieces
of
blue
construction
paper
with
a
short
paragraph
mounted
on
each.
Above
them
all
read
a
sign,
"What
Would
You
Do
if
you
were
President?"
After
taking
my
test
on
the
three
times
tables
for
the
second
time
because
I
failed
to
move
on
to
the
fours
the
previous
week,
I
decided
to
go
for
a
walk
to
the
bathroom.
I
enjoyed
going
into
the
hall
to
read
my
responses
to
the
weekly
question
posted
on
the
bulletin
board.
I
had
begun
to
notice
that
my
paragraphs
usually
had
less
red
corrections
than
some
of
the
other
kids'.
After
struggling
with
math,
it
made
me
feel
proud
and
reassured
to
read
my
writing.
I
had
always
loved
to
read
and
write,
but
I
was
just
beginning
to
realize
that
writing
was
something
I
did
with
a
fair
amount
of
ease.
I
had
always
envied
the
kids
who
completed
the
multiplication
flashcards
much
faster
than
me,
but
through
writing
I
discovered
an
academic
area
in
which
I
excelled.
As
a
Christmas
present
in
fourth
grade,
my
mom
gave
me
her
Anne
of
Green
Gables
book
by
L.M.
Montgomery.
It
held
special
sentimental
value
to
her,
as
it
was
her
favorite
book
as
a
young
girl.
It
soon
became
my
favorite
as
well.
Every
holiday
or
special
occasion
after
that,
my
mom
gave
me
another
book
from
the
Anne
of
Green
Gables
series.
I
found
them
to
be
an
escape
from
my
world
and
an
introduction
to
the
world
of
the
characters.
I
loved
to
read
them
and
wanted
to
be
able
to
create
a
fantasy
world
of
my
own.
Thus,
in
an
effort
to
emulate
the
style
and
structure
of
the
novels
I
loved,
I
began
creative
writing
in
my
spare
time.
I
wrote
stories
remarkably
similar
to
the
novel
I
was
reading
at
the
time
of
my
writing,
but
the
process
opened
my
creative
side.
I
began
keeping
journals
filled
with
miscellaneous
personal
works.
Some
pieces
were
silly
"Dear
Diary"
entries
about
boys
I
crushed
over,
while
others
were
stories
that
dealt
with
relatively
serious
issues
that
bothered
me.
Writing
was
a
way
through
which
I
coped
with
problems
or
expressed
thoughts
I
was
unable
to
clearly
articulate
to
others,
or
truly
understand
myself.
The
quality
of
my
independent
writing
was
enhanced
through
a
strong
academic
focus
on
writing
in
Mrs.
Lawrence's
fourth
grade
class.
The
ability
to
write
both
formally
and
creatively
was
a
core
focus
of
the
curriculum.
We
were
tested
on
our
writing
through
a
system
called
holistic
scoring.
A
township-wide
writing
was
assigned
to
measure
our
ability.
We
were
asked
to
describe
a
vacation
we
took
over
the
summer.
I
opted
to
write
about
my
trip
to
Disney
World.
Each
student
received
a
score
ranging
from
a
low
of
two
to
a
high
of
twelve.
When
our
papers
were
returned,
my
teacher
read
a
twelve
paper
to
the
class.
As
she
began
to
read,
I
was
astonished
to
recognize
my
own
words;
she
was
reading
my
paper!
When
she
completed
the
paper,
my
classmates
were
quick
to
point
out
that
I
switched
from
calling
my
vacation
destination
"Disney
World"
to
"Disneyland";
thus,
citing
my
paper
as
unworthy
of
a
twelve.
The
strong
sense
of
pride
I
felt
towards
my
writing
was
quickly
lessened
through
the
criticism
of
others.
Although
the
mistake
was
pointed
out
by
my
classmates
as
a
minor
one,
it
made
me
see
the
intensity
with
which
I
identified
with
my
writing.
I
realized
that
writing
was
not
only
an
art
I
did
for
myself,
but
also
a
part
of
me
I
desired
to
share
with
others.
Due
to
that
experience,
I
began
to
take
my
writing
very
seriously.
I
became
meticulous
about
details
and
focused
on
writing
numerous
drafts.
I
saw
myself
as
a
writer
and
wanted
to
create
the
best
product
of
which
I
was
capable.
In
sixth
grade
I
was
introduced
to
a
level
of
poetry
I
had
not
yet
encountered.
I
thought
that
all
poetry
rhymed
and
was
rather
simplistic
in
form
and
meaning.
However,
in
sixth
grade
I
read
timeless,
classical
poems
that
did
not
necessarily
rhyme,
but
exhibited
artistic
literature
at
its
finest.
The
beauty
of
word
choice
and
flow
enthralled
me.
I
learned
that
form
intensified
meaning
and
I
was
faced
with
the
obstacle
of
adding
another
dimension
to
my
personal
writing.
I
developed
a
particular
fondness
for
the
work
of
Langston
Hughes.
Knowing
he
was
a
black,
male
poet
during
the
early
1900's,
I
approached
his
poems
with
a
rather
closed
mind.
I
saw
little
in
his
material
with
which
I
could
identify.
However,
upon
further
reading
and
discussion,
I
saw
that
his
poems
exuded
emotion
and
universal
meaning.
His
writing
made
me
understand
the
emotion
behind
his
words.
Langston
Hughes's
poems
taught
me
that
poetry
is
not
about
the
words
on
a
page,
but
the
feelings
that
caused
the
poet
to
choose
those
particular
words
and
the
significance
and
power
of
their
usage
and
arrangement.
As
I
entered
my
teenage
years,
my
writing
began
getting
less
attention.
I
became
involved
in
numerous
school
activities
and
my
focus
changed.
I
stopped
writing
in
my
spare
time
and
began
viewing
writing
as
a
laborious
act.
The
writing
assignments
I
completed
for
school
lacked
inspiration.
My
writing
became
limited
to
formulaic
reports.
Very
little
of
my
papers
involved
work
with
creativity
or
style
focus.
My
desire
to
write
well
was
solely
derived
from
the
pressure
of
grades.
I
wanted
to
prove
to
my
teachers
that
I
was
a
good
writer,
but
my
lack
of
focus
on
writing
resulted
in
uninspired
pieces.
In
high
school
I
enrolled
in
the
honors
English
program
and
my
interest
in
writing
was
rekindled.
The
intellect
and
ingenuity
of
the
kids
in
my
class
impressed
me.
A
high
level
of
literary
analysis
existed
in
both
the
classroom
discussions,
as
well
as
written
work.
The
awe
I
had
for
my
fellow
classmates,
as
well
as
my
brilliant
and
prolific
teachers,
drove
my
personal
challenge
to
become
a
better
writer.
I
sought,
once
again,
to
identify
myself
with
writing
and
succeeded.
The
honors
English
program
was
a
ninth
through
twelfth
grade
intensive
program
in
preparation
for
the
Advanced
Placement
exam
senior
year.
We
were
introduced
to
classic
American,
British,
and
Irish
literature.
The
main
focus
was
novels;
although
there
was
a
lot
of
work
with
poetry.
The
writing
assignments
generally
revolved
around
the
"Five
Paragraph
Essay"
a
formula
used
in
literary
analyses,
consisting
of
an
introduction,
thesis
statement,
three
body
paragraphs,
and
a
conclusion.
As
freshmen
we
were
expected
to
follow
that
format
on
all
papers,
but
as
we
got
older
we
were
able
to
expand
upon
that
basic
format.
I
developed
a
true
love
for
American
literature.
Great
American
writers
such
as
Hemingway,
Fitzgerald,
and
Steinbeck,
influenced
me
greatly.
I
learned,
through
Hemingway,
that
sometimes
"less
is
more".
The
most
powerful
statement
in
a
book
can
often
be
the
simplest
in
form.
I
also
learned
the
importance
of
appealing
to
the
senses
in
writing.
Sensory
images
make
the
reader
see,
taste,
hear,
and
feel
the
characters'
experiences.
As
I
was
reading
Grapes
of
Wrath,
I
felt
that
I
was
suffering
through
the
Dust
Bowl
along
with
the
Joad
family.
The
intense
feeling
Steinbeck
evoked
from
me,
as
a
reader,
caused
me
to
try
to
emulate
the
style
of
great
American
writers.
Generally,
I
found
British
writers
to
be
more
detail
oriented,
focusing
a
great
deal
on
the
development
of
scenes
and
imagery.
Although
I
was
able
to
appreciate
most
classical
literature,
the
varying
styles
refined
my
sense
of
literature
and
helped
me
define
a
style
of
my
own.
Although
I
loved
analyzing
literature,
I
felt
the
need
to
have
a
more
expansive
background
in
English.
I
had
a
strong
background
in
formal
essay
writing,
but
felt
that
there
were
other
dimensions
to
writing
that
I
was
not
yet
exploring.
When
analyzing
classical
pieces,
accepted
theories
about
the
meanings
of
books
and
poems
exist
and
are
believed
to
be
the
message
intended
by
the
author.
Although
some
discussion
is
open
to
personal
opinion,
analyses
of
books
can
be
deemed
bizarre
due
to
lack
of
sufficient
support
for
the
theory
in
the
book.
I
longed
to
approach
literature
in
a
less
formal
manner.
Thus,
I
opted
to
take
an
elective
in
high
school
called
Women
in
Literature.
The
course
focused
on
books
containing
strong
female
characters;
thus,
incorporating
feminism
in
the
class.
We
covered
modem
material
and
addressed
issues
to
which
I
was
not
previously
accustomed.
I
found
the
class
to
be
very
refreshing.
The
teacher
adopted
an
informal
approach
to
teaching.
Most
of
the
papers
assigned
were
reactions
in
the
form
of
free
response.
Our
final
paper
involved
interviews
with
women
who
we
admired
and
respected.
They
told
us
their
interesting
tales
and
each
student
developed
a
paper
from
the
information
gathered.
The
final
project
was
my
first
introduction
to
interviewing
and
reporting.
I
enjoyed
my
experience
with
journalism
and
decided
it
was
something
I
would
like
to
pursue.
As
a
response
to
my
interest
in
journalism,
I
joined
the
school
newspaper.
I
was
a
Sports
editor,
although
I
worked
on
stories
in
several
different
sections
of
the
paper.
Interviewing
and
publishing
taught
me
to
be
comfortable
with
my
writing.
I
had
a
responsibility
to
both
the
readers,
editors,
and
those
I
interviewed,
to
write
a
good
story.
Confidence
in
my
writing
was
imperative
to
create
a
successful
story.
My
involvement
with
the
newspaper
continued
throughout
high
school
and
into
college.
I
learned
that
different
forms
of
writing
required
different
styles.
When
I
began
to
write
stories,
the
editor
would
remove
half
of
my
words
before
printing
the
article.
At
first
I
was
disheartened
and
believed
I
was
a
poor
newspaper
writer.
However,
soon
I
learned
that
writing
an
article
is
different
from
writing
a
paper
or
short
story.
When
reading
the
news,
people
want
the
facts;
thus,
the
article
should
be
clearly
written
and
without
extraneous
information.
I
realized
that
I
had
to
adapt
my
writing
to
the
type
of
writing
on
which
I
was
working.
My
involvement
with
the
newspaper
gave
me
an
added
appreciation
for
newspaper
and
magazine
articles
that
I
read
and
gave
me
a
behind
the
scenes
look
at
the
process
of
publication.
My
senior
year
of
high
school,
all
that
I
had
learned
about
formal
reading
and
writing
culminated
in
Advanced
Placement
English.
In
preparation
for
the
exam,
we
focused
on
timed
essays.
I
learned
how
to
construe
the
information
I
knew
solidly,
so
that
it
could
be
used
to
answer
the
question.
Timed
writing
pushed
me
to
prove
I
was
well-versed
in
the
content
and
style
of
the
book
in
a
short
period
of
time.
It
was
a
challenge
to
maintain
organization
and
flow
while
under
pressure
to
show
my
knowledge.
I
had
a
very
positive
experience
in
Women
in
Literature
and
although
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
AP
English,
I
desired
to
continue
to
enjoy
reading
without
the
pressure
of
being
responsible
for
every
detail
read.
Thus,
I
sought
out
a
course
that
would
offer
creative
stimulation.
I
added
a
Humanities
class
to
my
schedule.
It
was
the
most
extensive
English
class
I
had
taken.
It
incorporated
numerous
art
forms.
I
loved
the
class
and
looked
forward
to
the
release
it
provided
me
each
day.
Each
day,
as
we
walked
into
class,
we
were
greeted
with
a
musical
selection
and
asked
to
respond
to
a
quote
on
the
board.
Sometimes
we
created
artistic
representations
of
the
music
or
a
particular
passage
in
a
book.
The
beauty
of
nature
was
used
as
inspiration
in
the
class.
Often,
the
teacher
would
take
us
for
walks
outside
to
clear
our
heads
and
stimulate
our
creative
minds.
I
enjoyed
the
artistic
freedom
and
encouragement.
Humanities
offered
an
unconventional
and
refreshing
approach
to
writing.
At
Lafayette
a
wide
spectrum
of
English
courses
are
available
to
me.
Freshman
year,
I
was
able
to
tap
only
some.
At
school
I
am
surrounded
by
students
and
professors
who
are
experts
in
literature
and
art.
I
look
forward
to
growing,
as
a
writer,
in
the
face
of
their
expansive
knowledge.
As
an
English
major,
my
next
three
years
should
provide
me
with
new
writing
challenges
and
opportunities.
During
my
freshman
year,
I
was
asked
to
do
long
research
oriented
and
analytical
papers
that
were
more
extensive
in
requirements
than
any
previous
papers
I
had
done.
I
found
the
balance
between
factual
information
and
personal
opinion
to
be
difficult.
The
challenge
of
organization
was
the
toughest
aspect
I
faced
in
writing
papers.
My
creative
side
was
also
explored
in
free
writing
activities,
such
as
assignments
involving
the
use
of
a
magnetic
poetry
board.
In
math
class,
I
was
required
to
apply
my
writing
skills
when
doing
problems.
The
professor
was
interested
in
the
way
our
brains'
processed
the
information.
We
were
asked
to
write
down
the
steps
we
took
to
achieve
our
answer
and
then
we
offered
feedback
to
the
class.
I
believe
that
Lafayette
professors
treat
students
as
equals
and
respect
our
work
and
opinions.
As
a
result,
I
find
that
the
high
expectations
yield
a
mature
level
of
thinking
and
writing
for
me.
I
grew
tremendously
as
a
person
and
a
writer
my
first
year
and
feel
I
will
continue
to
do
so
throughout
my
next
three.
Writing
has
been
a
major
part
of
my
life.
I
have
looked
to
writing
for
help
with
expression,
coping
skills,
enjoyment,
and
entertainment.
Although
I
have
taken
steps
toward
becoming
an
accomplished
writer,
I
know
that
a
writer
never
stops
learning
and
growing.
I
hope
that
continued
growth
as
a
person
will
aid
the
maturation
of
my
writing.
Embarking
on
this
new
literary
journey
has
enriched
my
life.
