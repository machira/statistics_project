My
Literacy
Narrative
(and
eternal
chagrin)
It
is
hard
to
recall
when,
exactly,
I
first
became
literate
so
I
won't
even
try;
I
can,
however,
remember
the
first
time
my
writing
ever
affected
me.
I
was
in
the
second
grade
and
my
reading
teacher
was
Mrs.
Hogan.
She
was
a
short,
pudgy
women
with
a
remarkably
sunny
disposition
and
an
enjoyable
pedagogy
(primarily
because
it
often
involved
cookies).
Every
Thursday
Mrs.
Hogan
would
send
us
to
a
language
lab
with
another
teacher,
Mrs.
Bolt.
One
Thursday
I
was
in
the
middle
of
an
exercise
that
required
us
to
draw
a
picture
and
then
write
a
caption
beneath
it.
I
drew
Mrs.
Hogan
baking
cookies
and
appropriately
enough
intended
to
write
under
my
drawing
Mrs.
Hogan
baking
our
class
cookies
(or
something
like
that).
At
any
rate,
I
was
shuffled
off
to
the
language
lab
mid-sentence.
When
I
returned
I
quickly
finished
my
picture
and
turned
it
in.
The
next
day,
Mrs.
Hogan
had
posted
all
of
the
cartoons
--
all
except
for
mine,
that
is.
Needless
to
say,
this
wounded
my
fragile
8
year
old
ego.
I
mean
I
knew
I
wasn't
the
best
artist,
but
it
really
hurt
that
my
picture
was
so
bad
it
couldn't
be
posted
with
the
others.
I
later
asked
Mrs.
Hogan
what
I
had
done
to
merit
such
censure.
She
handed
me
my
picture
and
snapped
You
figure
it
out!
It
was
then
that
I
realized
that
in
my
rush
to
finish
the
project
I
had
written
Mrs.
Hog
baking
our
class
cookies.
Evidently,
Mrs.
Hogan
and
misinterpreted
my
hasty
error
with
an
attack
on
her
stature.
Granted,
mea
culpa,
but
in
retrospect
I
still
think
she
was
being
a
bit
harsh.
Anyway,
the
point
is
that
the
lesson,
while
a
tough
one,
taught
me
not
only
something
about
the
power
of
the
written
word
but
the
caution
one
must
exercise
when
employing
it.
While
surely
informative
and
instructive,
the
remainder
of
my
elementary
writing
career
was
uneventful.
We
learned
grammar
(ad
nauseam)
and
tried
to
forget
it
as
quickly
as
possible.
This
I
regret.
I
think,
though,
it
was
reading
that
really
taught
me
how
to
write.
I
remember
our
mother
would
always
read
to
my
siblings
and
I,
even
when
we
could
do
it
ourselves,
simply
for
the
sake
of
having
us
all
together.
She
read
from
Bronte,
Dickens,
Mann,
Dreiser,
and
Salinger.
I
remember
often
being
bored,
but
something
must
have
sunken
in
because
when
I
began
to
write
seriously
in
high
school
I
had
no
real
problem.
In
fact,
it
was
during
this
period
that
writing,
while
previously
turgid,
became
kind
of
rewarding.
I
remember
my
Freshman
year
English
teacher
telling
me
that
I
was
the
best
writer
in
the
class.
At
this
stage,
however,
I
was
still
writing
stories
(small
works
of
fiction
on
some
broad
topic)
and
was
being
evaluated
on
mechanics,
coherence,
and
style
more
than
anything
else.
It
wasn't
until
the
next
year
that
I
was
required
to
grapple
seriously
with
a
subject
by
teasing
out
the
implications,
assessing
them,
explaining
how
I
had
arrived
at
the
stated
conclusions,
and
then
attempting
to
add
something
creative
or
new
to
the
discussion.
The
person
responsible
for
introducing
me
to
the
rigid
requirements
of
academic
writing
was
Mrs.
Terry.
I
realize
that
I
am
not
supposed
to
mention
any
Lafayette
faculty
members
by
name,
so
I
guess
you
can
fire
me,
but
this
woman
made
Lusardi's
standards
look
lax.
Mrs.
Terry
was
simply
excellent.
She
was
demanding,
but
helpful
in
that
she
always
gave
thorough,
thoughtful,
and
timely
feedback.
Her
evaluative
technique
was
also
part
of
her
genius.
She
would
grade
content
and
mechanics
separately
(for
instance
and
A/B
would
mean
A
in
content
but
B
in
mechanics).
Pedagogically
speaking,
I
think
this
method
struck
the
balance
between
what
many
teachers
consider
a
huge
dilemma
--
whether
to
grade
on
mechanics
(which
usually
would
mean
a
lower
grade)
or
to
grade
on
the
ideas
presented
(which
are
usually
better
than
the
way
in
which
they
are
presented)
or
to
consider
the
piece
as
an
integrated
work.
I
think
the
first
is
the
most
helpful,
however
it
is
often
detrimental
to
student
egos
and
creativity,
thus
making
writing
more
loathsome
than
it
already
is.
The
second
manner
can
actually
be
helpful
in
encouraging
writers,
but
it
often
treats
grammatical
orthodoxy
as
ancillary.
The
third
technique,
while
I
consider
it
appropriate
at
this
level,
would
only
have
confused
me
during
that
stage
of
literacy.
Moreover,
Mrs.
Terry's
Sophomore
English
provided
me
with
some
literary
history.
She
also
introduced
us
to
a
number
of
deconstructive
techniques
(something
I
think
we
teach
in
Eng.
205
here)
and
different
genres.
I
remember
one
of
our
assignments
was
to
write
a
precis
emulating
the
style
of
our
favorite
ancient
Roman
author.
(as
if
any
of
us
had
a
favorite
ancient
Roman
author)
My
junior
year
provided
the
nadir
in
my
writing
development.
The
teacher,
Ms.
Smith,
was
a
flake.
While
I
think
she
was
under
the
impression
that
she
was
teaching
us
to
be
creative
and
showing
us
the
wonder
of
American
literature,
I
think
that
she
was
actually
treating
us
like
children.
That
is,
she
sheltered
us
from
any
of
the
nasty
feedback
which,
while
necessary,
would
make
writing
seem
hard
or
boring.
Just
to
give
you
some
of
how
goofy
she
was,
instead
of
giving
letter
grades
she
would
give
us
either
a
smiley
face
or
a
confused
face.
We
were
also
exposed
to
journal
writing
in
this
course,
however,
I
did
not
then
find
it
useful.
My
senior
year
I
was
happy
to
be
back
with
Mrs.
Terry
for
AP
English.
She
was
as
demanding
as
ever
and
was
quickly
able
to
help
me
undo
most
of
the
regressing
that
I
had
done
in
Ms.
Smith's
class.
She
made
our
class
read
many
of
the
seminal
authors
in
the
various
stages
of
western
literature
(Sophocles,
Aeschylus,
Virgil,
Cicero,
Aristotle,
Dante,
Chaucer,
Shakespeare,
Bronte,
Flaubert,
Ibsen,
Camus,
Joyce,
Eliot,
etc.).
In
addition
she
attempted
to
broaden
our
vocabularies
by
introducing
us
to
many
literary
terms
as
well
as
testing
us
on
possible
S.A.T.
words.
She
also
gave
frequent
sample
AP
tests,
required
secondary
critical
commentary,
and,
as
always,
required
many
long
papers.
I
sincerely
believe
she
was
able
to
broaden
both
my
literary
foundations
and
horizons
and
prepare
me
for
the
good
old
Lafayette
English
department.
When
I
met
my
FYS
professor
and
was
exposed
to
her
academic
expectations
I
became
even
more
grateful
to
Mrs.
Terry.
My
FYS
professor,
however,
was
so
pleased
with
my
writing
that
she
rarely
provided
any
earth
shaking
feedback.
However,
I
have
always
been
the
most
insecure
about
my
writing
ability.
Thus,
when
the
first
graded
assignment
in
my
college
career
was
in
my
FYS
I
was
anxious
to
get
the
results.
For
some
reason,
I
really
think
(again
in
retrospect)
that
her
professional
evaluation
of
my
work
could
have,
at
that
point,
either
made
or
ruined
my
college
career
and
my
perception
of
myself.
Luckily,
(and
I
don't
know
which
muse
to
thank)
I
was
awarded
the
only
A
on
that
assignment;
I
think
that
that
grade,
more
than
any
other,
has
determined
my
perception
of
myself
and
my
literacy.
(I
know
that
may
make
me
sound
really
shallow
and
neurotic,
but
hey,
we
all
have
our
vices)
It
was
in
due
in
large
part
to
the
FYS
professor
discussed
above
that
I
was
able
to
become
a
Writing
Associate.
Indeed,
my
stint
as
a
WA
has
also
helped
me
in
numerous
ways.
Not
only
has
it
made
me
more
self-conscious,
its
made
me
more
confident.
But
I
don't
want
to
dote
on
that
right
now
since
I
am
kind
of
mad
at
the
program
for
making
me
write
this
paper.
I
will
say,
however,
that
it
really
does
(I'm
not
just
B.S.ing)
help
me
A
LOT
as
a
writer.
The
person
to
whom
I
am
most
indebted,
however,
in
my
writing
journey
(and
in
life
itself
for
that
matter)
is
my
mother.
My
mom
has
taught
writing
at
Chemeketa
Community
College
for
twenty-three
years.
She
always
encouraged
us
to
read
and
always
checked
and
proofed
our
papers.
Most
helpful,
but
also
most
annoying,
is
her
feedback.
Most
teachers
will
either
write
something
or
only
mention
it
briefly,
my
mother
however
will
explain
the
error,
then
re-explain
the
error,
then
patronize
you
for
the
error,
then
discuss
the
etymological/historical
foundation
of
the
error,
and
finally
make
a
little
joke
about
the
error.
I
absolutely
hate
it.
Nevertheless,
this
exercise
(while
psychologically
destructive)
is
pedagogically
advantageous.
Her
influence,
however,
also
provides
a
Freudian/Oedipal
justification
for
why
I
consider
writing
so
important.
I
probably
think
I
try
to
do
it
well
just
to
please
my
mother.
Don't
get
me
wrong,
my
mother
is
very
cool,
hip,
loving,
nurturing,
thoughtful,
and
everything
else
but
I
really
think
my
writing
journal
is
affect
at
every
step
by
some
sort
of
need
to
please
my
mother.
Weird
huh.
In
closing
I
would
like
to
apologize
to
all
of
the
people
who
I
earlier
thanked
for
my
writing
development.
I
am
sure
that
this
paper,
which
probably
hasn't
been
revised,
is
a
disservice
to
them
all.
