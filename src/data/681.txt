Writing
and
WAing
This
past
year
was
not
exactly
characterized
as
my
ideal
school
year
because
of
circumstances
in
which
I
found
myself
during
the
fall
semester.
The
previous
year
I
had
made
the
adjustment
to
being
a
WA
fairly
easily.
It
was
difficult
at
times
to
juggle
my
class
work
load
with
my
WA
work
load,
but
it
all
turned
out
for
the
best
in
the
end.
At
the
beginning
of
the
year
I
was
extremely
confident
of
another
successful
year
as
a
returning
WA.
This
past
year,
things
again
went
well;
however,
there
was
a
definite
difference
between
the
fall
and
spring
semester.
The
fall
semester
was
neither
the
happiest
nor
easy
semester
of
my
life.
Having
an
overload
of
courses,
including
the
single
most
stress
inducing
course
of
my
college
career
(worse
than
the
stress
of
potentially
failing
Geology),
combined
with
my
WA
duties
left
me
in
a
rather
frantic
mood
for
most
of
the
semester.
In
the
end,
I
was
able
to
conquer
my
course
from
hell
and
still
juggle
my
WA
duties
without
self-destructing.
All
it
takes
is
a
little
time
management
and
a
slightly
unhealthy
dependency
on
caffeine.
Over
the
course
of
the
fall
semester,
I
grew
the
most
as
both
a
writer
and
WA.
In
the
spring
semester,
I
was
without
a
writing
intensive
course
and
my
WA
assignment
was
one
in
which
I
was
far
more
comfortable,
especially
after
my
experiences
in
the
fall
semester.
I
have
been
known
to
make
poor
choices
when
it
comes
to
my
course
registration
and
the
fall
semester
last
year
was
the
highlight
of
my
poor
planning.
Out
of
my
five
courses,
I
had
three
language
courses,
all
of
which
were
in
different
languages.
However,
these
courses
proved
to
be
the
easy
parts
of
my
semester
and
often
received
the
least
of
my
attention,
which
went
to
my
two
writing
intensive
courses.
The
first
of
these
courses
was
in
comparative
literature,
Russian
literature
of
the
19th
century
in
English
to
be
exact.
In
addition
to
large
amounts
of
nightly
reading,
I
was
assigned
to
write
about
literature,
which
I
have
not
really
done
in
this
sense
since
high
school.
The
course
was
fairly
self
directed
when
it
came
to
the
two
essays.
I
was
told
to
write
an
essay
about
the
works
we
had
read
in
class.
During
class,
occasional
hints
were
dropped
as
to
what
could
be
used
as
an
essay
topic,
but
the
assignments
were
always
open
ended
and
required
a
great
deal
of
personal
input.
This
was
a
little
new
for
me.
I
had
not
written
about
literature
in
this
manner
since
high
school
and
back
then
I
was
always
given
detailed
assignment
sheets
with
a
few
questions
to
answer
within
my
essay.
I
felt
a
little
rusty
at
first,
but
it
was
very
easy
to
write
when
I
calmed
down.
Taking
a
few
ideas
from
class,
I
was
able
to
come
up
with
some
sort
of
argument
based
around
the
works
of
19th
century
Russian
literature.
Thinking
about
the
works,
I
could
find
a
unifying
theme
in
them
somewhere.
Once
I
came
up
with
my
idea,
the
act
of
writing
the
piece
was
relatively
easy.
I
found
myself
working
in
a
rather
well
known
method:
basically
taking
a
five
paragraph
essay
and
expanding
it
to
seven
or
so
paragraphs.
Each
body
paragraph
was
filled
with
examples
and
quotations
from
the
stories
that
I
had
chosen
to
use.
Thankfully,
this
tried
and
true
method
worked
well
for
me.
My
fears
of
the
literature
course
and
discomfort
to
writing
in
that
style
were
nothing
when
compared
to
my
history
seminar
on
Russia
during
the
First
World
War,
which
was
definitely
the
toughest
course
of
my
college
career.
This
was
a
reading
and
writing
intensive
course
that
was
intended
to
prepare
me
to
write
a
thesis
if
I
chose
to
do
so.
As
a
typical
jump
up
in
the
history
department,
this
course
built
upon
the
research,
reading,
and
writing
skills
that
I
had
learned
in
my
previous
history
courses.
Each
week,
I
was
required
to
write
summaries
of
a
minimum
of
five
journal
articles
on
a
given
topic.
By
doing
this,
I
became
quite
adept
at
using
the
research
tools
provided
by
the
library.
I
also
became
well
versed
in
the
standards
of
scholarly
writing
in
the
field
of
Russian
history.
Additionally,
each
student
was
required
to
present
one
article
to
the
class
on
an
assigned
date.
We
were
asked
to
use
the
standard
conventions
of
critiquing
scholarly
journal
articles.
We
had
to
evaluate
the
claims
made
by
the
author
as
well
as
his
or
her
choice
of
support
material.
Furthermore,
we
were
encouraged
to
play
the
role
of
a
detective
and
provide
a
brief
biography
of
the
author
and
his
or
her
previous
writing
as
a
further
means
to
understand
how
and
why
he
or
she
reached
his
or
her
conclusions.
All
of
this
work,
as
well
as
background
reading
about
Russia
and
the
First
World
War,
was
designed
to
prepare
me
for
the
major
assignment
of
the
course,
the
twenty-five
page
paper
on
a
topic
of
my
choosing.
After
spending
weeks
looking
up
journal
articles,
it
was
easier
to
find
articles
and
other
sources
that
would
help
support
my
argument.
Another
part
of
the
assignment
was
to
evaluate
the
credibility
of
the
sources
that
we
employed,
which
we
had
practice
with
after
analyzing
authors
and
their
articles.
The
class
was
incredibly
interesting
because
it
contained
many
elements
that
are
familiar
to
a
WA.
For
example,
one
class
each
week
was
designated
as
a
writing
workshop,
in
which
we
went
around
the
room
and
discussed
our
topics
and
presented
our
findings
to
the
course.
Classmates
were
encouraged
to
bring
up
questions
they
had
as
well
as
to
share
any
relevant
information
they
had
come
across
in
their
own
research.
What
resulted
was
a
collaborative
environment
where
students
helped
each
other
out
as
well
as
asked
probing
questions,
which
were
not
too
unlike
those
asked
within
a
WA
conference,
in
hopes
of
strengthening
each
otherOs
papers.
This
peer
based
discussion
and
critiquing
was
taken
to
another
level
once
the
rough
drafts
of
the
papers
were
completed.
Everyone
had
to
read
everyone
elseOs
papers.
We
spent
two
classes
essentially
doing
mini
WA
conferences
by
going
around
the
room
and
having
every
comment
on
one
paper
at
a
time.
While
incredibly
helpful,
and
not
designed
to
turn
out
this
way,
the
end
result
was
like
having
the
WA
conference
from
hell.
I
now
fully
understand
why
as
WAs
we
are
asked
to
present
the
strengths
of
a
conference
piece
along
with
its
weaknesses.
The
end
result
was
a
fifteen
minute
barrage
of
whatOs
wrong
with
your
paper.
It
was
incredibly
helpful
and
constructive,
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
also
incredibly
overwhelming.
After
this
experience
I
made
sure
to
always
give
multiple
examples
of
the
strengths
of
a
students
paper
along
with
the
biggest
weaknesses
during
our
conferences.
As
horrible
as
the
whole
experience
of
the
class
was
at
the
time
due
to
the
stress
it
induced,
the
class
both
helped
me
as
a
writer
and
a
WA,
for
which
I
am
grateful.
The
close
analysis
of
historical
writing
enabled
me
to
better
assume
the
role
of
a
historical
writer
myself.
The
massive
scale
of
the
tasks
assigned
was
more
easily
accomplished
with
the
help
of
my
peers.
Furthermore,
as
intended,
this
course
helped
me
both
advance
as
a
writer
in
history
as
well
as
helped
me
to
prepare
for
writing
a
thesis,
which
I
will
be
doing
over
the
course
of
this
year.
Additionally,
this
course
helped
me
to
develop
as
a
WA.
I
now
fully
understand
how
a
student
could
feel
in
a
failed
WA
conference.
Also,
I
have
a
deeper
appreciation
of
peer
reviewers.
Without
the
help
of
my
fellow
classmates,
I
know
I
would
have
had
many
more
difficulties
in
the
writing
process.
At
times
I
felt
a
little
overwhelmed
or
I
would
reach
walls
in
my
research,
but
my
classmates
came
to
my
assistance
by
means
of
their
probing
questions
and
helpful
tips.
As
I
grew
as
a
reader
and
writer,
I
tried
to
implement
my
new
skills
in
my
WA
conferences
over
the
semester.
In
terms
of
my
WA
assignment
during
the
fall
semester,
I
do
not
really
have
any
complaints.
As
assumed,
I
was
assigned
to
an
FYS.
With
a
year
of
experience,
I
was
determined
to
make
the
semester
go
smoothly,
which
it
did
for
the
most
part.
My
partner
professor
was
a
good
match
and
his
attitude
towards
the
College
Writing
Program
was
excellent.
For
example,
he
was
trying
to
teach
his
freshmen
that
they
needed
to
be
more
responsible
for
their
actions.
Therefore,
he
had
no
pity
for
the
few
students
who
came
unprepared
to
our
meetings
or
those
who
failed
to
show
up.
Armed
with
two
semesters
of
experience
with
unprepared
students,
it
was
not
too
hard
for
me
to
come
up
with
questions
to
help
the
students
get
on
track
and
thinking
about
their
assignments.
As
the
semester
progressed,
it
was
even
easier
to
ask
in
depth
questions
about
their
assignments.
This
was
the
result
of
a
factor
that
was
unique
to
me
in
a
WA
assignment.
For
this
class,
I
met
with
the
students
twice
for
two
different
assignments.
Much
like
in
my
history
course,
I
was
able
to
see
the
pieces
progress
from
mere
outlines
or
rough
drafts
to
almost
finished
pieces.
By
meeting
twice,
I
had
a
greater
sense
of
what
the
students
wanted
to
accomplish
with
their
assignments.
However,
not
everything
was
perfect
in
this
assignment.
This
WA
assignment
was
also
different
in
that
it
was
the
first
semester
in
which
I
had
a
truly
difficult
student
to
work
with.
In
addition
to
having
problems
with
me,
he
also
had
problems
with
a
couple
of
WAs
during
drop-in.
Throughout
this
whole
experience,
I
learned
that
both
my
partner
professor
and
the
college
writing
program
were
supportive
of
me.
After
having
made
many
attempts
to
connect
with
the
student,
the
professor
told
me
that
it
would
be
acceptable
should
I
have
refused
to
meet
with
him
in
the
future.
In
the
spring
semester,
things
were
completely
different
and
I
did
not
run
into
any
problems
with
my
academic
life
or
my
WA
assignment.
In
the
spring
semester
I
was
back
to
taking
only
four
courses,
and
only
two
of
them
were
in
foreign
languages.
I
also
only
had
one
course
in
which
I
was
required
to
write
consistently.
I
branched
out
this
past
semester
and
took
a
music
course
about
film
soundtracks.
Writing
about
music
was
not
entirely
alien
to
me
as
my
FYS
was
about
the
development
of
music
in
Europe
from
the
Middle
Ages
to
the
French
Revolution;
however,
writing
for
this
course
challenged
me
a
lot.
We
were
given
a
number
of
writing
assignments
over
the
course
of
the
semester,
but
the
length
of
the
assignments
proved
to
be
the
struggle.
Normally,
it
is
not
hard
for
me
to
meet
the
minimum
requirements
of
the
assignment,
but
in
this
course
it
was
the
opposite.
We
were
often
given
a
limit
of
two
pages,
which
presented
a
number
of
new
difficulties.
Our
assignments
were
given
with
a
detailed
set
of
instructions
and
questions
that
were
hard
to
follow
in
the
two
page
limit.
I
found
myself
spending
the
same
amount
of
time
writing
two
pages
as
it
would
normally
take
me
to
write
five
or
six
pages.
I
had
to
constantly
edit
and
re-edit
my
words
and
thoughts
to
say
as
much
as
I
could
and
as
strongly
as
I
could
in
such
a
short
limit.
This
was
a
new
and
extremely
rewarding
experience.
In
addition
to
employing
new
techniques
in
my
writing
over
the
spring
semester,
I
also
used
new
techniques
when
it
came
to
my
WA
assignment.
I
was
once
again
paired
with
the
professor
with
whom
I
had
worked
last
spring.
This
was
both
good
in
bad,
in
a
certain
sense.
It
is
good
in
the
sense
that
I
have
a
great
relationship
with
this
professor
and
I
know
what
she
expects
from
her
students,
but
it
is
bad
in
the
sense
that
the
course
was
in
a
subject
that
I
know
nothing
about.
While
this
can
have
some
advantages
when
it
comes
to
reading
papers,
it
sometimes
causes
a
little
discomfort
on
my
part
because
I
do
not
always
feel
like
I
am
doing
the
best
that
I
could
do.
Often
there
are
questions
raised
that
are
specific
to
the
discipline
that
I
cannot
answer,
and
I
feel
like
this
sometimes
might
frustrate
the
students.
To
compensate
for
this,
I
reused
a
lot
of
what
I
learned
from
my
experience
in
my
history
seminar
and
applied
it
to
the
anthropology
course
to
which
I
was
assigned.
For
example,
I
would
often
ask
the
students
the
questions
that
I
would
ask
myself
to
critique
historical
writing.
Questions
of
point
of
view
and
the
historical
context
in
which
the
authors
were
living
often
applied
to
the
assignments
that
the
students
were
asked
to
complete.
Most
of
the
time,
the
students
had
ignored
questions
such
as
these;
thus,
in
the
process
of
answering
my
questions,
the
students
would
come
up
with
more
ideas
to
include
in
their
writing.
Over
the
course
of
the
past
semester,
I
grew
the
most
in
my
college
career
as
both
a
writer
and
a
WA.
By
challenging
myself
in
the
academic
setting,
I
ended
up
taking
courses
that
really
taught
me
to
shape
and
craft
my
writing
and
reading
skills.
The
techniques
that
I
learned
to
improve
my
own
reading
and
writing
in
turn
helped
me
to
improve
my
skills
as
WA.
After
a
semester
of
heavily
employing
peer
review,
I
really
learned
a
lot
of
techniques
to
pass
on
to
my
WA
students
from
what
sorts
of
questions
to
ask
them
to
using
the
libraryOs
resources.
This
year,
I
know
that
I
will
continue
to
grow
as
a
writer
while
I
work
on
my
honors
thesis,
and
I
know
that
this
experience
will
carry
over
into
my
WA
assignments.
