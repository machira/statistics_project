Entering
the
CWP
a
year
ago,
I
found
myself
challenged
on
several
fronts.
I
was
challenged
to
analyze
my
own
writing
process,
to
recognize
how
it
may
have
been
influenced
by
academic
convention
and
personal
experience.
I
was
challenged
to
make
conscious
what
I
implicitly
knew
about
writing
so
I
could
articulate
it
to
other
people.
I
was
challenged
to
help
my
peers
through
the
writing
process,
though
IOm
still
learning
what
this
means
and
how
to
approach
it.
Through
these
challenges,
my
writing
process
and
style
of
conferencing
have
evolved.
Now,
when
writing,
I
think
more
critically
about
the
relationship
between
writer
and
reader,
and
when
conferencing,
I
try
to
position
myself
more
as
a
supportive
peer
than
as
a
critic.
Working
as
a
writing
associate
has
certainly
changed
how
I
conceive
of
reading
and
writing
in
the
abstract.
Before
working
for
the
CWP,
I
was
more
likely
to
think
of
reading
and
writing
as
solitary
activities,
rather
than
as
a
social
act
or
exchange.
While
reading,
I
would
rarely
imagine
the
author
as
a
real
human
being,
with
a
certain
background
and
goals.
I
would
often
treat
the
text
as
a
kind
of
disembodied
voice
and
give
little
thought
to
its
purpose,
intended
audience,
or
historical
context.
Likewise,
when
writing,
I
was
hardly
conscious
of
the
context
in
which
my
work
was
being
read.
I
did
not
think
critically
about
the
academic
conventions
governing
the
way
professors
would
judge
my
essays.
Neither
did
I
consider
that
professors
often
read
papers
en
masse
and
under
time
constraints.
Overall,
before
working
for
the
CWP,
I
read
and
wrote
largely
without
imagining
the
human
being
on
the
other
end
of
the
act
of
communication.
Several
aspects
of
my
experience
as
a
writing
associate
have
made
me
focus
more
on
the
relationship
between
writer
and
reader
during
the
writing
process.
First,
I
encountered
a
great
deal
of
Nwriter-based
proseO
during
my
first
year
as
a
WA,
and
I
am
now
more
sensitive
to
this
tendency
in
my
own
writing.
Writer-based
prose,
as
Linda
Flower
explains,
is
writing
that
might
make
perfect
sense
to
the
author,
but
fails
to
give
the
reader
the
background
knowledge
necessary
for
interpretation.
Characterized
by
a
narrative
quality,
or
by
Nprivately
loaded
terms,O
writer-based
prose
often
represents
the
authorOs
first
attempt
to
answer
a
question,
and
so
seems
like
a
record
of
the
author
discovering
what
she
wants
to
say
(Flower
20).
During
my
second
semester
as
a
WA,
I
encountered
one
student
whose
work
exemplified
writer-based
prose,
as
perhaps
demonstrated
by
the
title
of
his
research
paper,
NTransgenic
Animals
as
an
Art
Form,
WTF?O
LetOs
call
this
student
Matt.
Because
MattOs
drafts
were
consistently
only
a
few
pages
long,
but
hinted
at
complex
ideas,
it
seemed
he
needed
more
time
to
transform
his
thoughts
into
a
structure
that
another
person
could
follow.
Working
with
this
student
and
others
helped
me
realize
the
importance
(and
difficulty)
of
imagining
oneself
as
a
reader
of
oneOs
own
writing.
I
developed
certain
strategies
to
help
students
recognize
the
need
to
reduce
the
interpretative
burden
which
their
essays
placed
on
readers.
In
one
conference
with
Matt,
for
example,
I
asked
him
to
reread
his
draft
and
elaborate
on
sentences
whose
relationship
to
the
preceding
sentences
was
mysterious.
By
forcing
him
to
reread
his
writing,
after
the
assignment
had
probably
faded
from
his
mind,
I
was
helping
him
to
approximate
the
perspective
of
readers
who
might
struggle
to
follow
the
essayOs
private
logic.
I
also
asked
Matt
to
identify
places
where
he
could
use
signpost
words,
like
Nfor
example,O
Nhowever,O
and
Nto
begin.O
The
intent
of
this
exercise
was
to
help
him
identify
the
main
components
of
his
argument,
so
we
could
make
their
relationships
more
explicit
to
readers.
I
now
use
both
strategies
more
often
in
my
own
writing,
when
I
am
trying
to
determine
where
my
essay
would
seem
opaque
to
a
reader
with
little
inside
knowledge
of
my
thought
process.
Over
the
past
year,
I
also
changed
the
way
I
envision
the
rhetorical
relationship
between
student
and
professor.
Finding
a
rhetorical
position
is
a
complex
process
to
begin
with,
as
it
includes
determining
oneOs
purpose
in
writing,
the
assumptions
one
may
legitimately
make,
the
background
information
that
needs
to
be
explained,
and
the
objections
which
must
be
addressed.
For
students,
the
complexity
of
this
process
is
compounded
by
ambiguities
surrounding
the
role
of
the
professor.
Several
students
have
asked
me,
for
instance,
how
much
they
should
assume
that
the
professor
knows.
At
first
I
told
them
to
pretend
that
the
professor
knows
little
about
their
topic,
in
the
hopes
that
they
would
therefore
elaborate
on
each
step
of
their
analysis.
However,
a
large
number
of
those
students
complained
to
me
that
this
mind
game
felt
artificial,
since
the
professor
was
obviously
extremely
knowledgeable.
In
response,
I
tried
to
hold
a
more
realistic
conversation
about
their
rhetorical
position.
I
suggested
that
even
a
knowledgeable
reader
like
a
professor
can
benefit
from
background
information
or
a
clarification
of
terms,
as
context
for
a
more
complex
or
controversial
point.
Moreover,
if
part
of
an
essayOs
purpose
is
to
gauge
student
knowledge,
then
students
can
conceive
of
their
task
in
writing,
not
as
informing
the
professor,
but
as
showing
what
they
have
learned.
I
have
found
that
applying
this
paradigm
to
my
own
writing
feels
more
natural
than
pretending
that
professors
are
novices
at
their
subjects.
My
experience
in
the
CWP
has
not
only
influenced
my
writing
process,
but
it
has
also
altered
my
conception
of
what
counts
as
success
in
a
writing
conference.
Before
my
very
first
round
of
conferences,
I
believed
it
was
my
role
to
mark
each
place
where
I
felt
a
paper
needed
improvement.
I
filled
the
margins
with
comments
and
questions,
sometimes
writing
sideways
to
conserve
space.
A
successful
conference,
I
thought,
was
one
in
which
I
could
explain
most
of
my
highly
specific
suggestions
within
the
half-hour
time
limit.
As
a
result,
my
first
conferences
were
fairly
one-sided,
as
I
simply
told
students
what
I
thought
they
did
well
and
could
do
better.
The
ineffectiveness
of
this
approach
became
immediately
clear.
I
was
working
with
first-semester
freshmen,
who
are
generally
eager
to
do
well,
but
donOt
know
what
to
expect
from
a
college
class
and
may
be
insecure
about
their
abilities
in
a
new
academic
setting.
After
I
launched
into
my
elaborate
suggestions,
most
of
the
students
remained
quiet,
sometimes
nodding.
When
students
would
ask
a
question,
it
would
be
a
request
for
me
to
evaluate
their
work
or
compare
them
to
other
students.
After
a
round
of
awkward
conferences
in
which
I
did
much
of
the
talking,
I
realized
my
approach
wasnOt
working,
for
several
reasons.
Most
importantly,
I
had
not
encouraged
anyone
to
think
about
writing.
I
suspected
that
the
students,
fresh
from
high
school,
were
accustomed
to
teachers
simply
telling
them
how
to
change
their
rough
drafts.
Since
I
was
mimicking
those
teachers,
(not
knowing
how
else
to
behave),
the
students
may
have
viewed
my
suggestions
as
a
checklist
of
corrections
to
make,
after
which
the
revision
process
would
be
finished.
In
other
words,
I
may
have
given
students
the
false
impression
that,
if
they
addressed
all
my
suggestions,
their
essays
would
be
perfect,
and
their
work
would
be
done.
Needless
to
say,
handing
students
a
checklist
of
revisions,
(e.g.
move
this
paragraph
here,
integrate
this
quote),
did
not
encourage
them
to
think
independently
about
where
and
how
to
revise.
I
realized
that
students
would
benefit
more
if
I
used
conferences
to
engage
them
in
a
general
discussion
about
writing,
or
to
develop
strategies
they
could
use
to
revise
any
paper.
Indeed,
my
barrage
of
suggestions
probably
had
limited
value
for
students,
because
they
were
tailored
to
the
specific
assignment.
During
the
first
round
of
conferences,
I
also
realized
that
certain
aspects
of
my
approach
were
silencing
students,
both
literally
and
metaphorically.
Because
I
was
extremely
nervous,
I
was
tempted
to
fill
every
pause
in
the
conversation.
Even
after
asking
a
question,
I
was
so
afraid
of
silence
that
I
would
continue
to
rephrase
the
question
until
I
could
sense
that
the
student
wanted
to
respond.
Thus,
I
may
not
have
given
students
sufficient
opportunity
to
speak.
My
critical
tone,
moreover,
may
have
silenced
students
through
intimidation.
Because
I
cast
myself
as
an
authoritative
critic
rather
than
a
supportive
peer,
many
students
seemed
to
accept
my
suggestions
at
face
value
or
ask
for
evaluative
feedback,
as
if
I
were
a
professor.
One
student,
for
example,
asked
me
directly
what
his
grade
would
be
and
was
surprised
when
I
explained
that
I
was
not
in
a
position
to
make
that
judgment.
Because
I
had
led
students
to
view
me
as
a
teacher,
they
probably
did
not
realize
that
they
had
the
power
to
raise
their
own
concerns
about
their
writing
or
the
assignment.
Therefore,
they
remained
largely
quiet.
These
early
experiences
played
a
significant
role
in
shaping
my
conception
of
a
successful
conference.
During
my
second
semester
as
a
WA,
I
held
a
conference
that
illustrates
how
my
definition
of
success
has
changed.
A
student,
letOs
call
him
Justin,
turned
in
two
pages
of
writing
and
a
one-page
outline
as
a
rough
draft,
though
it
was
meant
to
be
much
longer.
He
explained
that
he
was
having
trouble
thinking
of
what
to
write.
A
semester
earlier,
this
situation
would
have
baffled
me
because
it
was
not
amenable
to
entirely
directive
feedback.
However,
I
had
since
had
some
practice
in
balancing
directive
suggestions
with
more
facilitative
feedback,
or
using
questions
and
discussion
to
help
students
develop
revision
plans
in
a
collaborative
way.
I
had
also
grown
calm
enough
to
think
on
my
feet
and
did
not
need
to
rely
on
notes
I
had
already
written.
Realizing
that
Justin
was
still
in
the
brainstorming
phase
of
the
writing
process,
I
began
by
simply
asking
him
to
explain
his
outline
to
me.
From
there,
I
was
able
to
ask
more
specific
questions,
like
how
his
ideas
tied
into
class
readings,
or
how
someone
might
disagree
with
a
certain
point.
When
he
couldnOt
answer
a
question,
I
would
offer
possible
answers,
or
I
would
say
that
he
could
think
about
it
later
if
he
wanted
to
do
more
brainstorming.
We
spent
most
of
the
conference
discussing
his
topic
and
taking
notes,
as
it
was
simply
too
soon
to
address
some
of
the
more
mechanical
aspects
of
writing.
By
the
end,
Justin
seemed
less
discouraged
and
said
he
thought
he
had
enough
relevant
material
to
finish
the
paper.
I
consider
this
conference
successful
for
several
reasons.
First,
I
spoke
to
Justin
as
a
sympathetic
peer,
not
as
a
critical
authority.
When
he
put
forth
an
idea,
I
would
give
some
sort
of
encouraging
comment,
then
ask
him
to
elaborate
or
think
about
where
it
might
fit
in
the
paper.
In
other
words,
I
was
able
to
transform
my
critical
edge
into
benign-sounding
questions.
To
answer
them,
Justin
had
to
practice
habits
of
mind
that
could
be
applied
to
brainstorming
for
any
writing
assignment.
Eventually,
I
was
able
to
dispense
with
the
leading
questions
because
Justin
learned
to
anticipate
them.
At
that
point,
the
dynamic
of
the
conversation
changed
so
that
we
were
simply
two
students
conversing
on
an
equal
level.
Plus,
because
I
showed
an
interest
in
and
respect
for
JustinOs
ideas,
I
think
he
gained
confidence
in
himself
and
felt
motivated
to
work
more
on
the
assignment.
Though
I
think
much
of
this
conferenceOs
success
owed
to
the
facilitative
approach,
and
the
spirit
of
collaboration
it
fostered,
the
directive
approach
may
still
be
apt
in
certain
situations.
If
students
make
repeated
grammatical
or
citation
errors,
for
instance,
there
may
be
no
other
option
than
to
direct
them
how
to
correct
them.
Moreover,
sometimes
the
directive
approach
can
be
used
to
focus
and
narrow
the
facilitative
approach.
One
could
use
the
directive
approach,
for
a
example,
to
point
out
an
opportunity
for
improvement
in
a
paper,
then
use
the
facilitative
approach
to
ask
the
student
to
brainstorm
possible
solutions.
Where
the
directive
approach
is
used
in
excess,
though,
it
can
alienate
students
and
deny
them
power
over
their
own
writing,
as
I
found
during
my
first
round
of
conferences.
Overall,
my
first
year
in
the
CWP
has
certainly
shaped
my
relationship
to
writing.
In
order
to
discuss
rhetorical
positioning
with
students,
I
have
had
to
develop
new
strategies
of
envisioning
and
accommodating
my
audience.
My
goal
in
conferences,
moreover,
is
no
longer
to
correct
NerrorsO
through
directive
feedback,
as
it
was
during
my
first
round
of
conferences.
Now
I
see
myself
as
more
of
a
supportive
peer,
who
guides
students
to
their
own
revision
solutions
through
pointed
questions.
I
hope
that
my
writing
conferences
today
are
far
more
encouraging
and
collaborative
than
my
first
attempt.
