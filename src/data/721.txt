Returning
WA
Narrative
8/8/11
On
The
Same
Page
In
The
Same
Story
Once
upon
a
time,
I
had
a
script
in
my
head
of
how
life
as
a
WA
would
unfold.
I
imagined
the
job
of
the
WA
as
someone
selected
and
hired
to
save
students
from
any
unfortunate
acts
of
academic
dishonesty
or
insufficient
explanations
of
academic
arguments.
If
the
script
is
designed
to
adapt
a
fairytale,
then
the
Writing
Associate
is
always
the
hero
of
the
story.
In
fact,
many
students
that
interview
for
the
job
often
mention
helping
friends
that
live
in
their
dorm
NeditO
papers.
Potential
candidates
for
hire
always
seem
compelled
to
share
any
detail
that
suggests
a
capability
to
competently
provide
advice
and
to
graciously
offer
assistance.
ItOs
natural
for
interviewees
to
assign
themselves
the
role
of
the
hero,
the
one
that
is
the
light
in
the
darkness
of
the
infinite
shadows
of
anxiety
that
research
papers
symbolize
for
many
students.
I
remember
feeling
the
same
way.
What
the
interviewees
do
not
know
is
that
not
all
students
will
look
to
them
as
a
Nhero.O
For
students,
it
is
almost
instinctual
to
remain
skeptical
of
a
WA.
Not
many
of
us
are
apt
to
take
advice
from
people
outside
of
family
or
friends,
a
wise
choice
for
the
most
part.
However,
this
makes
it
difficult
to
fulfill
the
role
as
the
hero.
A
WA
must
work
to
earn
the
trust
of
students.
Sometimes,
students
will
vocalize
that
YouOre
the
best
WA
ever!
Often
though,
students
may
not
praise
the
WA
even
if
they
think
such
thoughts.
I
think
that
for
any
WA,
learning
this
lesson
early
on
is
helpful.
The
WA
must
work
with
all
types
of
personalities
and
learn
to
appreciate
the
the
challenge
of
working
with
all
kinds
of
writers.
I
have
enjoyed
my
experiences
as
a
WA
because
it
has
not
only
presented
me
with
an
opportunity
to
reflect
and
improve
my
writing,
but
also
taught
me
how
to
grow
as
an
open-minded
person.
The
past
year
as
a
Writing
Associate
reinforced
many
of
the
lessons
I
learned
my
first
year
on
the
job.
I
have
accepted
that
there
are
no
guarantees
and
that
there
are
always
surprises
that
swoop
in
and
require
a
quick
wit
to
combat
successfully.
This
past
year
has
taught
me
temper
my
judgments
and
to
listen
more
often
than
I
spoke.
More
importantly,
the
past
year
taught
me
the
real
heroic
act
is
when
a
student
stumbles
upon
the
answer
to
solve
their
difficulties
themselves.
During
the
fall
semester,
the
FYS
I
had
nine
students
enrolled.
When
I
met
with
my
partner
professor
for
the
semester,
our
meeting
was
brief.
The
syllabus
for
the
class
was
only
two
pages,
an
aberration
from
the
typical
ten
page
syllabi
that
I
usually
encountered.
I
was
provided
with
a
brief
description
of
the
class
structure,
but
provided
with
no
hint
as
to
what
the
assignments
the
students
would
work
on
throughout
the
semester.
A
student
knocked
on
his
office
door
for
office
hours
and
our
brief
five-minute
introduction
was
over.
Somehow,
I
knew
the
semester
was
going
to
stand
out
from
others.
About
a
week
later,
I
got
an
email
from
my
partner
professor
inviting
me
to
a
class
dinner
at
Sogo
so
I
could
meet
the
students
(the
FYS
was
about
exploring
Asian
culture).
Always
accept
these
invitations
because:
1)
Meeting
in
a
non-academic
setting
makes
a
WA
seem
less
intimidating
and
2)
Free
food
is
never
something
a
college
student
should
turn
down.
Of
course,
I
was
the
last
to
arrive
to
a
dinner
party
where
I
was
a
complete
stranger
to
most
everyone.
The
students
that
sat
on
the
opposite
end
of
the
table
barely
acknowledged
my
arrival
and
refused
to
sample
any
of
the
sushi
that
the
professor
urged
them
to
at
least
taste
once
in
their
life.
Luckily,
the
students
sitting
to
my
right
and
left
were
much
more
conversant
and
less
reluctant
to
try
the
food
that
the
professor
ordered.
The
professor
was
quiet
for
most
of
the
dinner,
but
he
seemed
observe
everything
going
on
at
the
dinner.
The
only
conversation
the
professor
really
engaged
me
in
was
an
explanation
of
the
first
writing
assignment
for
the
semester.
The
students
would
have
to
write
a
reflection
on
the
dinner
and
how
food
represented
culture.
In
addition,
they
would
have
to
write
a
paper
designing
their
own
dinner
party
and
describing
the
food
they
would
serve.
At
least
the
invitation
to
dinner
made
more
sense
at
the
end
of
the
evening.
The
experience
of
working
with
this
group
of
first
year
students
made
me
feel
like
Wile
E.
Coyote
chasing
the
Roadrunner.
More
frequently
than
any
other
class
assignment
I
have
had,
these
students
played
the
NI
Forgot
to
Show
Up
Card.O
See,
thereOs
no
guarantee
as
to
whether
or
not
students
will
arrive
on
time
for
conferences
or
whether
or
not
they
will
remember
to
show
up.
The
studious
ones
almost
always
arrive
early,
coffee
in
hand
and
perhaps
a
muffin
squirreled
away
in
their
slightly
unzipped
backpack
or
purse.
Forgetful
ones
might
panic
later
and
send
an
apologetic
email,
expressing
pangs
of
guilt
and
pleading
for
a
chance
to
reschedule.
And
the
only-in-the-class-because-I-need-to-pass-to-graduate
ones
dawdle
on
their
return
from
sports
practice
or
dinner
or
some
other
social
gathering
and
slouch
or
slink
back
in
their
chair,
hoping
the
mandated
interlude
will
pass
quickly
enough
without
too
much
required
conversation.
They
may
lackadaisically
answer
questions
about
their
paper
topic
or
may
confess
that
they
hardly
possess
any
recollection
of
writing
a
paper
at
all.
The
only-in-the-class-because-I-need-to-pass-to-graduate
ones
were
the
majority
in
this
FYS.
For
the
most
part,
WAs
are
studious
and
ambitious
individuals
that
hate
to
disappoint
others.
ItOs
easy
to
forget
that
there
are
students
that
are
not
as
conscientious
with
their
writing
habits
and
their
etiquette.
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
the
fall
waiting
for
students
that
would
never
show
up.
Only
three
of
the
students
either
showed
up
on
time
or
at
least
emailed
if
they
needed
to
reschedule.
Conferencing
was
not
an
issue
as
long
as
I
had
a
student
actually
come
to
their
scheduled
time.
My
frustration
with
these
students
stemmed
from
lack
of
courtesy
and
respect
for
my
time.
The
previous
year
I
hardly
had
any
issues
with
students
coming
to
conferences.
Eventually
I
learned
to
bring
a
book
and
conserved
my
energy
for
the
students
remembered
to
come.
However,
I
did
enjoy
working
with
the
students
that
came.
For
their
final
research
paper,
I
discovered
that
they
were
having
trouble
finding
research
materials
in
the
library.
More
so
than
previous
semesters,
I
devoted
an
entire
conference
to
going
over
research
tactics
and
navigating
through
the
stacks
of
Skillman.
These
students
reminded
me
the
importance
of
teaching
students
how
to
use
the
library
for
research
purposes.
OneOs
paper
is
only
as
good
as
the
research
they
can
find.
A
good
WA
conference
does
not
mean
confining
work
to
a
conversation
at
table
in
the
Skillman
Caf
or
in
a
classroom
of
Pardee.
Interactive
exercises
make
WA
work
more
interesting
and
engaging
for
both
parties.
Although
students
may
not
like
unconventional
assignments,
I
find
that
any
innovation
makes
NworkO
more
enjoyable
and
more
worthwhile.
I
think
I
surprised
students
when
I
said:
Okay,
letOs
go
look
for
books
in
the
library.
If
a
student
asks
surprised,
do
not
feed
into
their
quizzical
countenance.
Follow
through
on
the
plan.
TheyOll
be
grateful
later.
I
ran
out
of
time
with
one
student
and
I
offered
to
schedule
an
additional
time
to
help
them
find
more
research
materials.
As
long
as
students
are
respectful
of
my
time,
I
have
no
problem
helping
out
beyond
the
four
mandated
conferences.
The
extra
time
is
usually
how
I
end
up
with
some
new
friends
and
new
friendships
are
a
rewarding
part
of
WA
work.
Overall,
the
FYS
was
rewarding
in
odd
ways.
The
professor
for
the
class
is
part
of
the
Computer
Science
faculty.
Whenever
I
had
meetings
with
him
after
a
round
of
conferences
we
always
ended
up
talking
about
books
and
movies.
I
never
would
have
developed
any
kind
of
camaraderie
with
this
professor
if
I
were
not
a
WA.
As
much
as
I
love
studying
English
and
Film
and
talking
to
professors
in
those
departments,
itOs
always
fascinating
to
converse
with
professors
from
other
disciplines.
Always
treat
a
partner
professor
well
and
keep
in
touch
with
them
whenever
possible.
In
my
case,
this
professor
helped
me
network
so
I
could
shadow
at
a
creative
media
company
this
summer.
Many
times
partner
professors
do
not
engage
in
Nlife-chattingO
with
WAs,
but
my
partner
professor
repaid
my
work
with
kindness
and
mentorship.
From
the
FYS
I
learned
that
the
much
of
the
work
of
a
WA
is
about
earning
respect.
There
is
more
to
a
WA
than
possessing
a
certain
amount
of
proficiency
in
writing.
A
WA
should
also
model
the
virtues
of
kindness
and
compassion.
Students
and
partner
professors
may
not
read
what
a
WA
writes,
but
students
and
professors
will
remember
the
character
traits
of
the
WA.
In
addition
to
having
my
own
group
of
students
to
WA,
I
had
to
go
to
a
WA
for
one
of
my
seminar
classes.
Out
of
pure
coincidence,
the
WA
assigned
to
my
seminar
is
also
one
of
my
closest
friends.
At
first,
it
seems
strange
for
a
WA
to
have
to
see
another
WA
for,
but
I
found
the
experience
insightful
and
a
rare
chance
to
compare
conference
approaches.
Even
though
we
have
weekly
staff
meetings,
it
is
very
difficult
to
obtain
any
sense
of
how
different
WAs
conduct
their
conferences.
My
friend
would
go
through
a
stack
of
papers
and
make
comments
in
almost
available
space
in
the
margins
so
she
would
not
forget
important
points
to
address
during
her
conferences.
I
prefer
to
keep
my
comments
at
a
bare
minimum
and
use
checkmarks
to
keep
track
of
specific
points
in
the
paper
that
I
wish
to
address.
My
friend
would
reveal
her
general
impressions
of
the
paper
before
asking
students
about
their
writing
process.
I
always
begin
my
conferences
by
asking
the
student
how
their
other
classes
are
treating
them
before
even
turning
my
attention
towards
the
official
conference
conversation.
Despite
our
varying
approaches,
I
found
that
my
friendOs
structure
and
style
for
conferences
was
successful
as
well.
There
is
no
one
size
fits
all
approach
to
conferencing.
Even
though
I
am
usually
reluctant
to
share
my
writing
with
my
friends,
I
found
I
appreciated
the
assistance
of
a
WA
much
more
as
an
upperclassman.
Over
time,
I
have
chosen
to
attack
increasingly
intricate
topics
and
arguments
throughout
my
writing.
Keeping
everything
inside
my
without
discussing
my
thoughts
throughout
the
writing
process
makes
it
almost
impossible
to
gain
perspective
on
whether
or
not
there
is
any
logic
that
exists
in
my
writing.
I
still
feel
strange
about
sharing
my
writing
with
others,
but
I
understand
that
for
clarityOs
sake,
another
set
of
eyes
reading
my
writing
is
an
extraordinary
asset.
As
I
prepare
for
my
thesis,
I
feel
more
at
ease
knowing
that
I
understand
both
my
strengths
and
weaknesses
as
a
writer.
For
the
spring
semester,
I
was
assigned
to
WA
for
the
same
engineering
VaST
that
I
was
a
WA
for
the
previous
year.
When
I
discovered
this,
I
was
not
keen
on
experiencing
dj
vu.
The
paper
assignments
were
so
incredibly
dull
that
I
would
rather
wait
for
an
egg
to
fry
on
the
sidewalk
in
winter.
On
the
bright
side,
at
least
I
knew
what
to
expect
from
the
professor
and
the
papers
this
time
around.
Overall,
the
VaST
students
were
an
enjoyable
group
to
work
with.
Plus,
with
a
class
of
20
students,
I
was
not
as
frustrated
when
only
four
kids
missed
conferences.
I
had
accepted
that
it
is
impossible
to
control
other
students.
Stressing
over
elements
out
of
personal
control
is
a
waste
of
energy
and
only
produces
more
frustration.
This
particular
group
of
students
exhibited
great
determination
to
explain
their
ideas
to
me,
even
the
technically
advanced
ideas
that
are
intended
for
an
engineering
audience.
Unlike
the
year
before,
these
students
also
showed
more
creativity
in
their
writing
assignments.
Although
most
of
their
writing
assignments
were
in
a
memo
format
and
highly
technical
and
formal
pieces,
the
effort
to
explore
quality
arguments
in
their
writing
was
pretty
impressive.
My
critiques
for
these
conferences
involved
working
with
students
to
find
the
best
organizational
flow
for
their
writing.
This
may
sound
mundane,
but
when
students
are
active
in
the
conference
itOs
like
solving
a
jigsaw
puzzle.
The
human
brain
thinks
in
almost
a
random
energy
pattern.
It
is
almost
impossible
to
write
something
in
the
correct
order
the
first
time.
Papers
are
usually
showcase
a
chronological
thought
process,
but
it
is
difficult
for
the
human
brain
to
think
in
a
way
that
allows
for
perfect
organization
on
the
first
go.
As
a
WA
emphasize
revision
whenever
possible.
Jigsaw
puzzles
only
make
sense
when
put
together
in
the
correct
sequence.
The
jigsaw
puzzle
analogy
is
something
that
helps
me
with
my
own
writing.
I
do
not
write
a
lot
of
papers
that
are
on
technical
subjects,
but
I
read
and
NWAO
a
lot
of
papers
that
are
pieces
of
technical
writing.
Reading
these
papers
forces
me
to
ask
questions
so
that
I
can
ensure
that
the
paper
adequately
describes
the
topic
at
hand.
I
ask
myself
the
same
questions
when
I
re-read
my
own
work
and
even
when
I
explain
my
opinion
in
class.
Technical
papers
also
force
met
to
observe
how
the
paper
is
organized
and
structured.
In
the
humanities,
it
is
easier
to
stretch
the
bounds
of
structure
for
creative
argumentation.
However,
the
best
writers
provide
clarity
regardless
of
the
structure
of
the
paper.
As
a
WA,
sometimes
the
papers
are
outside
a
certain
comfort
zone.
In
the
end,
exposure
to
different
types
of
writing
provides
a
means
to
see
how
personalized
a
writing
process
is
for
each
individual.
There
are
many
right
ways
to
write
a
paper.
Never
impose
a
personal
writing
strategy
or
voice
upon
another
students.
Retelling
personal
anecdotes
as
examples
is
often
useful
for
students,
but
delivering
lectures
on
writing
is
a
blow
to
a
studentOs
self-esteem.
Give
them
the
tools
to
find
the
answer
themselves.
Sometimes
the
surprises
along
the
way
are
better
than
the
ones
imagined.
I
try
to
take
what
I
learn
and
pass
it
on
when
I
can
to
those
who
ask
for
help.
Maybe
as
a
WA
I
am
not
a
hero
today
or
tomorrow
to
a
student.
Making
a
student
into
his
or
her
own
hero,
well
now
that
is
something
worth
writing
a
story
about.
