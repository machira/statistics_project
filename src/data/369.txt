A.
Returning
Writing
Associate
Assignment
August
2002
Since
being
employed
as
a
WA
last
fall
I
have
found
that
my
writing
process
has
changed
quite
a
bit.
I
have
become
much
more
aware
of
errors
made
while
writing
simply
through
the
practice
I
got
from
reading
so
many
papers
in
such
a
critical
manner.
I
have
really
started
to
think
about
my
work
more
as
a
process
than
as
an
assignment.
I
have
really
worked
on
and
improved
my
patience
with
my
own
writing
as
well
as
my
ability
to
reshape
and
restructure
writing
that
I
would
have
otherwise
thought
"good
enough."
Not
only
have
the
one-on-one
conferences
greatly
helped
my
own
writing
and
editing
skills,
but
the
weekly
staff
meetings
have
also
aided
me
in
my
improvements
in
writing
over
the
past
year.
Meeting
weekly
with
my
fellow
WA's
as
peers
along
with
Professor
Seetch
to
focus
on
specific
writing
issues
was
also
something
that
I
found
quite
beneficial.
In
really
served
as
a
way
to
"keep
me
on
my
toes."
Overall,
I
would
have
to
say
that
my
experience
as
a
WA
has
been
the
most
rewarding
experience
I've
had
as
one
who
loves
to
write.
Through
this
I
have
been
able
to
help
others
improve
upon
not
only
specific
assignments
but
also
their
own
writing
techniques.
Using
my
own
skills
and
talent
to
help
others
has
been
quite
rewarding.
It
was
a
huge
bonus,
of
course,
that
as
I
did
what
I
loved,
helped
peers,
and
even
sharpened
up
on
my
own
skills,
I
was
also
getting
paid!
Using
this
money
I
earned
as
a
WA,
I
spent
the
second
semester
of
last
year
abroad
in
Australia,
where
a
college
education
is
quite
a
different
experience.
In
my
four
courses
I
had
very
minimal
writing
to
do,
and
because
of
this,
I
felt
that
my
academic
writing
abilities
were
slipping.
My
courses
at
Flinders
University
in
South
Australia
were
each
centered
on
only
two
or
three
large
assignments.
This
put
a
lot
of
pressure
on
students
to
make
sure
those
assignments
were
done
exceptionally
well.
I
also
found
that
my
papers
last
semester
had
much
shorter
and
stricter
word
limits,
which
forced
me
to
really
focus
on
what
the
bulk
of
the
paper
needed
to
be
about,
making
sure
I
did
not
talk
too
much
about
any
specific
point
and
at
the
same
time,
making
sure
I
did
speak
about
all
that
was
necessary
to
point
out
in
adequate
enough
detail.
This
was
quite
a
challenge
for
me,
and
something
I
was
not
very
comfortable
with.
I
am
thankful
for
the
experience
however
because
it
has
taught
me
yet
another
important
aspect
of
academic
writing.
While
studying
at
Flinders
University
I
took
a
creative
writing
course
which
also
was
quite
a
workout
for
my
writing
skills.
While
I
was
concentrating
on
strict
word
limits
and
being
sure
to
abide
by
many
writing
rules,
I
was,
on
the
other
hand,
writing
more
creatively
than
I
ever
had
before
for
school.
Although
sixty
percent
of
my
grade
for
the
course
was
based
on
a
short
story
turned
in
at
I
the
semester's
end,
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
writing
all
sorts
of
pieces.
Probably
the
most
interesting
was
an
assignment
in
which
I
had
to
write
like
William
Faulkner,
in
a
stream
of
consciousness.
That
was
quite
challenging,
but
probably
one
of
the
most
fun
pieces
of
work
I've
ever
compiled.
What
is
most
interesting
to
me
is
that
writing
like
Faulkner
is
not
something
that
I
would
have
sat
down
and
thought
to
do,
yet
the
assignment
was
one
that
I
am
proud
of,
and
one
that
my
Professor
was
quite
fond
of
as
well.
I
also
wrote
poetry
in
all
sorts
of
meters
and
styles
and
about
many
different
things.
One
week
the
class's
assignment
was
to
write
a
poem
on
an
object.
I
chose
to
write
it
on
a
photograph
I
had,
describing
in
detail
how
much
it
meant
to
be,
as
it
was
a
photograph
of
a
friend
of
mine
who
died.
In
the
poem
I
discussed
how
a
torn,
wax-coated
piece
of
paper
is
all
that
I
have
left
of
such
a
special
individual,
and
while
in
that
picture
he
is
so
happy,
he
is
alive
no
longer.
I
discussed
how
that
simple
object
has
witnessed
me
cry
over
him,
and
has
absorbed
my
angry
swears
that
he
is
now
dead.
The
point
of
including
this
description
is
that
I
would
have
never
thought
to
simply
write
a
poem
on
an
object,
yet
this
poem
was
actually
honored
by
being
published
in
an
Australian
poetry
journal
while
I
was
overseas.
In
short,
the
creative
writing
course
that
I
took
while
in
Australia
was
another
tremendously
rewarding
experience.
Although
I
did
find
being
forced
to
be
creative
rather
uninspirational,
I
have
come
out
of
the
course
with
some
pieces
of
work
that
I
am
rather
proud
of.
In
truth,
the
semester
that
I
spent
at
Flinders
was
quite
different
than
the
previous
five
I
had
spent
at
Lafayette.
I
was
used
to
classes
that
had
constant
reading
and
work
to
be
done.
In
Australia,
that
is
not
the
way
the
higher
education
system
works.
Because
so
much
weight
was
placed
on
so
few
assignments,
there
was
not
a
constant
workload
at
all.
For
this
reason
I
had
more
free
time
than
ever
before
in
my
life.
While
I
have
to
admit
to
sleeping
excessively
and
spending
a
bit
too
much
time
on
the
internet,
I
did
quite
a
bit
of
writing
on
my
own
in
a
journal.
Looking
back
over
the
things
I
wrote
while
I
was
immersed
in
another
culture
has
made
me
really
appreciate
the
way
I
lived
my
life
for
five
months.
I
am
very
thankful
that
I
had
the
time
to
do
some
of
this
sort
of
introspective
writing,
that
if
at
Lafayette,
I
would
bet
I
would
not
have
had
the
time
to
do.
From
descriptions
of
the
people
I
met
and
the
places
I
visited
to
the
feelings
that
I
was
experiencing
in
the
different
places
I
traveled
to
just
plain
old
self-exploration,
the
journal
I
kept
while
I
was
in
Australia
is
also
one
of
the
most
rewarding
pieces
of
writing
I
have
to
date.
I
suppose
that
is
really
all
I
can
say
about
the
writing
I've
done
over
the
past
year.
My
two
semesters
were
as
different
as
night
and
day.
From
spending
time
as
a
WA,
engrossed
in
academic
writing
and
therefore
constantly
improving
mine
to
a
semester
of
both
strict
word
limit
restrictions
and
extremely
interesting
creative
writing
pieces,
I
have
had
quite
a
bit
of
variety
over
the
past
year
in
my
writing.
Regardless,
I
have
cherished
both
semesters,
as
I
absolutely
loved
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
and
I
look
so
very
forward
to
doing
it
again.
Along
with
peer
counseling,
it
is
without
a
doubt,
the
most
rewarding
thing
I've
done
while
at
Lafayette
College.
I
will
now
move
on
to
speak
more
specifically
about
how
my
experience
as
a
Writing
Associate
has
helped
shaped
me
into
the
writer
(and
WA)
that
I
am.
Thinking
back
on
my
semester
with
Professor
Rinehart's
FYS,
I
vividly
recall
one
student
who
made
my
job
quite
difficult.
Over
our
five
conferences,
she
came
to
me
with
papers
that
were
completely
grammatically
incorrect,
had
no
thesis
statement,
lacked
any
sort
of
fluidity,
and
quite
simply
would
have
probably
gotten
failing
grades.
My
five
conferences
with
this
student
never
ran
shorter
than
a
half
hour.
I
remember
being
so
very
frustrated
by
the
way
that
she
would
take
in
what
I
was
saying,
constantly
retorting
with
things
like
"I
think
what
I
have
sounds
fine!"
I
would
never
take
it
upon
myself
to
change
a
student's
voice
or
style,
but
simple
things
like
the
need
to
reorganize
paragraphs
by
idea
or
topic
or
even
to
create
new
sentences
were
things
that
this
student
did
not
want
to
hear.
Things
got
to
be
the
worst
when
in
our
final
session
(which
the
student
always
managed
to
be
tardy
for)
I
had
read
her
paper
in
advance
and
had
circled
the
word
"Satin"
in
her
title
which
clearly
should
have
read
"Satan."
I
of
course
did
not
address
this
mark,
assuming
that
she
would
of
course
realize
her
mistake.
She
however,
was
critical
of
any
mark
that
I
made
on
her
paper
and
confronted
me
about
why
I
had
circled
the
word.
I
simply
explained
that
she
had
spelled
it
incorrectly,
but
she
insisted
that
"Satan"
was
indeed
spelt
S-A-T-l-N.
After
I
pulled
out
a
dictionary
and
showed
her,
she
still
insisted
that
she
in
fact
was
right
and
replied
that
"I
will
not
change
anything
in
my
paper
regardless
of
what
you
say."
Clearly,
this
student
was
a
challenge
for
a
WA,
and
certainly
did
not
make
my
job
easy.
Probably
my
most
rewarding
experience
as
a
WA
was
seeing
some
of
the
students
really
benefit
from
my
suggestions.
I
could
often
tell
when
I
was
getting
through
to
students,
could
see
that
something
I
said
really
made
sense.
A
few
times
I
saw
suggestions
that
I
had
made
really
shine
through
in
later
papers,
and
I
could
tell
that
the
students
were
really
learning
how
improve
their
writing.
There
was
one
student
who
would
seek
my
help
on
papers
outside
of
FYS,
which
I
would
never
mind
helping
her
out
with.
I
recall
checking
my
email
in
Australia
to
find
an
email
asking
me
if
I
would
read
her
first
paper
of
second
semester.
She
didn't
realize
that
I
was
out
of
the
country,
but
to
know
that
I
really
helped
her
and
to
see
the
improvement
in
her
writing
as
her
papers
went
on
was
actually
quite
touching.
As
for
this
year,
I
look
forward
to
meeting
a
whole
new
group
of
students
and
working
with
them
as
writers.
Although
I
had
hoped
to
work
with
Professor
Rinehart
again,
since
she
is
not
teaching
the
FYS
again,
I
will
also
get
to
read
on
a
whole
new
range
of
material,
stepping
away
from
the
Satanic
focus
of
last
year's
FYS
students.
I
truly
hope
that
I
have
made
a
mark
on
the
students
that
I
worked
with,
as
I
put
a
lot
of
myself
into
my
job.
I
hope
that
this
year's
students
will
be
just
as
eager
and
grateful
for
the
amount
of
effort
I
put
into
helping
them
to
become
better
writers.
In
conclusion,
I
suppose
the
advice
I
offer
to
new
WA's
is
to
just
be
yourself.
Don't
let
the
students
take
advantage
of
you,
and
certainly
don't
attempt
to
rewrite
their
work
for
them,
but
obviously
the
new
WA's
are
WA's
because
they
are
talented.
Put
as
much
into
a
conference
as
the
student
will,
and
remember
that
the
conference
is
to
benefit
them,
so
if
they
are
not
interested
in
your
helping
them
to
further
their
writing
skills,
don't
overextend
yourself.
This
is
a
mistake
that
I
made
as
a
new
WA.
But
by
being
myself,
working
with
the
students,
and
just
remembering
that
I
really
did
enjoy
what
I
was
doing,
my
WA
experience
so
far
is
one
that
I
will
remember
and
cherish.
