WA
Narrative
From
Crayons
to
Word
Processors:
The
Story
If
one
were
to
explore
my
house
in
beautiful
southeastern
Pennsylvania,
they
would
find
it
difficult
to
leave
without
seeing
some
trace
of
my
early
literary
career
on
display
somewhere
inside.
For
instance,
the
attic
contains
countless
stacks
of
boxes
covered
with
the
words
Becky,
Mom,
and
Dad,
written
in
a
nearly
illegible
scrawl.
The
desk
on
the
second
floor
has
old
tablets
in
it
with
similar
cryptic
messages
scattered
among
the
pages.
An
old
tote
bag
in
the
downstairs
closet
bears
the
names
of
some
of
my
friends
when
I
was
a
four-year-old,
and
my
old
beginner
piano
books
have
everyone's
name
that
I
could
think
of
written
on
the
covers.
Though
I
may
have
lacked
creative
themes
for
these
first
written
compositions,
my
prolificacy
was
rather
impressive
for
a
pre-schooler,
if
I
do
say
so
myself.
Basically,
any
object
I
could
find
that
would
serve
as
a
medium
for
my
written
work
was
subjected
to
crayon,
pencil,
pen,
and
magic
marker
alike,
as
my
inner
thoughts
spilled
out
and
took
a
concrete
shape.
Luckily
for
my
writing
career,
my
inner
thoughts
eventually
became
a
bit
more
substantial
and
diverse,
and
luckily
for
my
parent's
possessions,
I
gradually
became
more
selective
about
my
choice
of
materials
for
my
writing.
At
any
rate
though,
the
die
was
cast,
and
it
was
clear
to
everyone
that
little
was
going
to
be
a
writer.
My
first
experience
with
writing
in
sentence
form
occurred
in
Mrs.
Spirat's
second
grade.
Largely
regarded
by
the
students
as
the
eccentric
teacher
(aside:
we
probably
just
regarded
her
as
weird,
not
knowing
what
the
word
eccentric
meant:),
Mrs.
Spirat
was
given
to
bursting
forth
into
song
at
random
moments
during
lessons,
as
well
as
initiating
free-for-alls
when
she
would
select
objects
off
her
desk
to
launch
at
students
around
the
room,
in
the
hopes
of
catching
someone
off
guard
and
beaning
them
in
the
head.
Nevertheless,
Mrs.
Spirat
was
also
fond
of
encouraging
us
to
write
creatively,
and
thus,
time
was
set
aside
every
day
for
work
in
our
composition
books.
It
was
in
such
a
book
that
I
composed
my
first
literary
masterpiece,
a
short
story
entitled
"Me,
Tana,
and
Christian
in
Loveland
Woods".
As
characters
for
my
story
I
drew
inspiration
from
my
best
friend
Tana
Zerr,
as
well
as
my
then-current
crush,
Christian
Epting,
not
bothering
to
change
their
names
to
protect
their
identities.
Using
a
mere
Dixon-Ticonderoga
#2
pencil,
I
painstakingly
created
a
sweeping
narrative
about
our
adventures
lost
together
in
the
wilderness,
which
ultimately
(and
rather
predictably,
I'm
afraid)
lead
to
Christian
falling
in
love
with
me.
During
sharing
time,
when
students
were
encouraged
to
read
their
work
to
the
class,
I
proudly
stepped
forward
and
regaled
the
class
with
my
epic
tale.
(However,
in
retrospect,
I
greatly
fear
that
the
class
was
not
at
all
entertained,
due
to
the
fact
that
the
story
really
makes
no
sense
while
it
simultaneously
goes
nowhere.)
At
any
rate,
parents
and
teachers
alike
praised
me
for
my
'creative
talents',
and
I
felt
that
my
literary
career
was
truly
underway.
However,
this
elated
feeling
was
bound
to
subside,
and
subside
it
did
when
two
years
later
my
class
was
presented
with
the
Fourth
Grade
Project.
Not
only
was
this
project
of
the
research
nature,
but
it
had
to
be
one
page
of
notebook
paper
in
length,
both
sides!
(I
believe
it
was
at
this
juncture
in
time
that
I
first
learned
what
stress
was.)
Following
the
advice
of
my
teacher,
I
selected
a
project
topic
that
interested
me,
and
it
was
thus
that
I
ended
up
doing
my
report
on
killer
whales.
After
doing
some
light
reading
in
the
library,
I
felt
I
was
ready
to
sit
down
and
compose
my
report.
Unfortunately
for
my
father,
he
made
the
mistake
of
attempting
to
help
me
with
my
assignment.
Not
being
familiar
with
the
idea
of
writing
a
rough
draft,
I
scoffed
at
his
suggestion
to
use
pen
instead
of
pencil.
After
all,
it
wasn't
as
if
I
was
going
to
write
the
dam
thing
twice,
so
why
not
just
use
pencil
the
first
time
around
to
facilitate
the
editing
process?
However,
the
last
straw
was
his
advice
that
one
did
not
write
all
the
way
to
the
edge
of
the
piece
of
paper.
At
this,
I
burst
into
tears
and
told
him
that
the
teacher
had
NEVER
mentioned
this
concept
of
'margins'
to
us,
and
that
I
was
sure
my
father
was
wrong.
To
avoid
getting
in
trouble
at
school
for
not
following
directions,
I
stubbornly
covered
every
last
square
inch
of
the
paper
with
my
handwriting
and
was
proud
of
myself
for
not
being
swayed
by
the
newfangled
ideas
of
my
father.
During
these
elementary
years,
I
also
attended
a
class
for
the
gifted
once
a
week.
(Though
to
this
day,
I
am
dubious
of
my
acceptance
into
this
program
since
I
distinctly
remember
answering
"eleven"
to
the
question,
"How
many
months
are
there
in
a
year?"
during
the
IQ
examination.
What
is
especially
embarrassing
is
the
fact
that
it
was
my
birth
month
of
February
that
I
overlooked
while
attempting
to
come
up
with
an
answer.)
At
any
rate,
someone
was
convinced
I
had
potential,
so
each
week
I
attended
this
class
where
creativity
as
a
skill
was
paramount.
Our
teacher,
Mrs.
Miller,
would
give
us
special
writing
assignments
designed
to
make
us
expand
our
little
minds
each
week.
One
assignment
in
particular
that
stands
out
in
my
memory
asked
us
to
write
about
who
we
felt
was
our
hero.
I
did
in
fact
answer
that
my
father
was
my
hero,
in
what
was
perhaps
a
sort
of
disguised
apology
for
doubting
his
wisdom
on
the
whole
margins
thing
a
few
years
before.
Our
work
in
this
environment
was
never
graded,
so
we
never
felt
any
pressure
to
fulfill
a
length
requirement
or
to
consider
who
our
target
audience
would
be.
We
wrote
for
ourselves,
and
I
found
this
form
of
writing
very
satisfying,
even
at
such
a
young
age.
To
this
day,
I
prefer
"personal"
writing
to
any
other
form
of
writing,
an
inclination
that
I
attribute
to
the
experiences
in
the
gifted
class.
It
was
around
this
age
that
I
also
began
keeping
a
diary
for
myself.
This
occurrence
was
particularly
memorable
because
it
marked
the
first
time
I
made
a
conscious
decision
to
write
something
without
the
prompting
of
a
teacher.
The
next
stage
of
my
writing
career
was
the
period
of
time
from
about
sixth
to
ninth
grade,
wherein
I
only
remember
writing
notes
to
all
my
friends!
To
the
casual
observer,
note
writing
may
not
seem
to
have
many
benefits
to
a
budding
writer,
but
my
experiences
have
lead
me
to
embrace
a
different
viewpoint.
Though
I've
always
been
a
tad
on
the
obsessive/compulsive
side
(e.g.
writing
my
name
as
a
child
9,000
times
on
our
family
belongings),
it
was
through
these
casual
correspondences
that
I
developed
my
obsession
with
syntax
and
diction.
I
felt
that
the
goal
of
my
letters
was
to
make
my
friends
laugh,
so
I
would
agonize
over
each
word
and
phrase,
thinking
it
through
until
I
came
up
with
a
sentence
that
conveyed
the
exact
connotation
and
humorous
expression
I
was
striving
for!
Though
this
did
teach
me
to
give
greater
attention
to
the
finer
points
of
writing,
this
strategy
actually
hindered
me
when
it
came
to
lengthy
assignments,
as
I
would
deliberate
so
long
over
inconsequential
words
that
it
would
take
me
forever
to
complete
the
paper.
However,
this
was
a
necessary
first
step
to
finding
a
balance
between
writing
efficiently,
yet
choosing
effective
wording.
Entering
high
school
proved
to
be
a
definitive
challenge
for
me
as
a
writer.
The
writing
assignments
and
reports
kept
getting
longer,
while
the
questions
posed
by
the
teachers
were
possessing
greater
depth.
I
had
to
learn
how
to
express
higher
order
thinking
in
writing,
as
well
as
master
the
fine
art
of
critiquing
literary
works.
The
crowning
achievement
for
me
was
my
senior
year
AP
English
project,
wherein
each
student
had
to
read
a
work
of
literary
merit
that
they
selected
and
then
had
to
write
a
report
based
on
literary
criticisms
about
a
main
theme
of
the
book.
I
chose
to
read
Tender
is
the
Night
by
F.
Scott
Fitzgerald,
a
book
which
I
enjoyed
immensely,
and
it
was
extremely
gratifying
to
have
selected
a
theme
I
wished
to
write
about,
only
to
find
that
it
was
what
most
literary
critics
had
chosen
to
write
about,
too.
In
a
sense,
I
felt
like
I
really
"connected"
with
this
project.
Because
I
had
understood
the
book
so
much,
I
had
no
trouble
organizing
my
thoughts
or
coming
up
with
ideas
to
incorporate
into
the
report.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
was
finished
with
a
major
project
before
the
deadline.
(For
as
much
as
I
enjoyed
the
feeling
of
getting
to
bed
early
the
night
before
it
was
due,
one
would
think
I
would
have
continued
this
practice
of
"non-procrastination"
into
my
college
career.
However,
something
seems
to
have
gone
awry
in
the
two
years
that
have
passed
since
twelfth
grade!)
Despite
my
perceived
success
on
my
English
project,
the
actual
AP
placement
test
was
probably
the
hardest
writing
assignment
I've
ever
been
given.
I
felt
like
the
questions
presented
would
take
me
a
few
weeks
to
successfully
answer,
not
the
three
hours
or
so
that
we
were
allotted.
I
panicked
immediately
and
lost
all
capacity
to
think
clearly,
and
needless
to
say,
I
did
not
have
a
good
feeling
about
my
work
when
I
left
the
test.
I
felt
like
I
had
just
written
down
whatever
came
to
mind
without
giving
it
any
thought,
because
I
had
so
much
material
to
cover
in
so
short
a
time.
In
fact,
I
felt
so
embarrassed
about
how
poorly
I
was
sure
I
had
done
that
I
remember
going
home
and
crying!
I
was
secretly
wondering
if
maybe
my
acceptance
to
Lafayette
could
be
revoked
on
account
of
me
suddenly
losing
my
intelligence.
However,
when
the
test
scores
arrived
that
summer,
I
was
completely
astounded
to
see
I
had
gotten
a
4
on
a
scale
of
1
to
5,
with
5
being
the
highest!
From
this
experience,
I
suppose
I
learned
that
I
am
my
own
worst
critic,
although
this
would
not
be
the
last
time
I
would
doubt
my
abilities
as
a
writer.
I
enjoyed
the
AP
English
assignment
so
much
that
I
briefly
considered
majoring
in
English
when
I
got
to
college.
Everyone
tells
you
to
"do
what
you
like",
and
I
thought
that
I
would
never
find
something
I
enjoyed
as
much
as
writing.
However,
I
was
also
looking
forward
to
an
environmental
career
at
the
time,
so
I
was
persuaded
to
pursue
science
and
math
at
Lafayette,
rather
than
writing
and
language.
Regardless
of
major,
all
freshmen
at
Lafayette
are
required
to
take
a
first
year
seminar,
or
FYS.
Primarily
a
writing
course,
this
class
is
a
college
student's
first
exposure
to
papers
at
the
college
level.
The
good
grades
and
praise
from
my
teachers
that
I
had
received
about
my
high
school
writing
had
me
convinced
that
this
course
was
going
to
be
a
breeze.
However,
it
turned
out
that
the
actual
writing
phase
of
our
assignments
was
not
the
toughest
part;
understanding
what
the
questions
actually
meant
was
by
far
the
most
challenging
aspect
of
this
class!
These
were
questions
that
didn't
really
even
have
an
answer,
so
the
objective
was
to
somehow
capture
your
thoughts
on
the
subject
and
present
a
convincing
argument
without
knowing
if
you
were
right
or
wrong.
For
someone
who
likes
black
and
white,
yes
or
no,
it's
either
right
or
it's
not,
this
was
a
difficult
step
to
make,
and
one
that
I
don't
feel
I
made
very
well!
Though
I
received
an
A
in
the
class
and
was
selected
to
be
exempt
from
the
College
Writing
course
in
the
spring,
I
was
decidedly
unhappy
with
my
performance
as
a
writer.
I
felt
as
though
I
had
lost
my
ability
to
express
myself
coherently
and
that
my
thinking
skills
were
not
what
I
had
thought
them
to
be.
Perhaps
the
A
meant
that
I
had
done
better
than
I
thought,
or
maybe
just
that
I
had
done
better
than
my
peers,
but
to
me
the
grade
might
as
well
have
been
an
F
for
all
the
pride
I
felt
in
my
work.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
felt
insecure
and
incompetent
as
a
writer.
It
was
not
until
fall
of
my
sophomore
year
that
I
started
to
become
confident
in
my
writing
once
again.
For
my
engineering
ethics
class,
I
had
to
write
a
research
paper
on
global
warming.
Since
the
topic
was
particularly
interesting
to
me,
I
was
able
to
"connect"
with
the
project
just
like
I
had
done
on
my
AP
English
assignment.
My
research
and
writing
were
completed
early,
and
when
I
handed
my
final
copy
in,
I
felt
fully
confident
that
I
had
done
my
best
work.
A
few
weeks
later
I
was
rewarded
for
my
efforts
when
I
learned
I
had
earned
the
best
grade
in
the
class
on
the
paper.
The
conclusion
I
drew
from
this
experience
is
that
my
best
writing
manifests
itself
when
I
can
find
a
way
to
really
interest
myself
in
the
project.
Though
not
profound,
keeping
this
sentiment
in
mind
has
helped
me
each
time
I
have
gotten
a
new
writing
assignment,
in
that
the
first
thing
I
now
determine
is
how
to
make
the
project
have
special
meaning
for
me.
Hopefully
this
same
philosophy
will
help
me
guide
other
writers
towards
achieving
their
best
work.
