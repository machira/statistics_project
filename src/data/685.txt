Your
History
as
a
Writer
My
work
as
a
Writing
Associate
will
definitely
require
me
to
deal,
Nimplicitly
or
explicitly,
with
the
effects
of
other
writers'
literacy
histories,O
so
understanding
my
own
history
will
allow
myself
to
be
an
informed
reader
of
othersO
writings.
My
writing
style
has
been
molded
by
a
select
few
teachers
and
has
evolved
into
a
fairly
blunt
style
that
supports
both
argumentative
and
scientific
essay
writings.
Even
before
attending
school,
I
was
able
to
practice
writing
both
on
the
family
computer
and
on
our
old
typewriters.
Although
I
mainly
used
the
computer
to
practice
writing,
I
was
always
interested
in
the
typewriter
because
you
could
actually
see
how
it
worked.
Even
today,
I
still
think
watching
the
key
stroke
is
fascinating
and
the
hum
of
the
machine
is
fantastic.
I
mainly
wrote
basic
sentences
and
practiced
creating
words
because
I
liked
their
shapes
and
thought
it
was
so
interesting.
I
wasnOt
interested
in
doing
anything
by
hand
so
continued
to
use
the
computer
until
I
was
forced
to
do
work
by
hand
in
school.
I
also
most
likely
didnOt
like
writing
things
by
hand
because
teachers
never
liked
my
handwriting.
Normally
I
didnOt
get
any
comments
on
it
but
I
saw
other
students
were
praised
for
their
penmanship
and
I
never
was.
I
only
really
noticed
this
in
5th
grade
when
good
handwriting
was
rewarded
with
permission
to
write
assignments
in
pen
D
something
I
was
never
allowed
to
do.
The
main
bulk
of
writing
I
had
to
do
in
elementary
and
junior
high
was
Nreflective
writings,O
which
I
despised.
Writing
about
how
a
story
made
me
feel
or
about
a
trip
I
took
I
thought
was
pointless
and
a
waste
of
time.
Everything
we
wrote
in
elementary
school
was
very
uninteresting
for
me
because
it
was
so
basic.
I
did
enjoy
the
assigned
readings
but
when
we
were
still
only
writing
about
how
a
story
made
us
feel
in
4th
grade,
I
got
sick
of
English
and
just
thought
it
was
very
boring.
Even
for
NfunO
writing
like
Power
of
the
Pen,
a
timed
creative
writing
extracurricular
activity,
I
tried
out
for
the
activity
only
because
my
sister
had
done
it
and
I
was
curious
about
it.
I
didnOt
enjoy
the
try-out
and
I
didnOt
make
the
team
but
I
still
acted
as
a
NrunnerO
so
I
could
hang
out
with
my
friends
on
the
team.
As
a
runner,
I
just
ran
the
written
essays
to
and
from
the
judges
and
this
I
actually
enjoyed.
I
got
to
organize
students
and
have
a
simple,
relaxing
job
to
do.
I
actually
started
to
wonder
why
I
had
even
tried
out
for
the
team
because
every
time
I
saw
what
the
prompts
were
(e.g.
Raise
a
Question
No
one
Seems
to
be
able
to
Answer
and
offer
a
Solution,
NRescued,O
NThe
Midnight
Escape,O
etc.),
I
just
thought
how
stupid
they
were.
I
thought
that
the
essays
were
fun
to
read,
but
that
creative
writing
was
just
a
stressful,
uninteresting
time.
I
knew
what
type
of
writing
style
I
liked
but
I
was
too
indecisive
to
produce
a
story.
I
always
wanted
to
create
a
good
writing
piece
and
just
became
aggravated
instead.
Another
thing
I
found
extremely
annoying
was
handwriting
a
rough
draft
for
in-class
essays.
Our
teachers
always
wanted
us
to
do
a
rough
draft
so
they
could
check
its
paragraph
structure
and
grammar.
I
would
submit
my
rough
draft
and
even
though
it
had
so
few
errors,
I
still
would
have
to
re-write
the
final
copy.
I
would
have
to
do
double
the
work
for
no
reason,
which
not
only
was
annoying
but
tiring
as
well.
Finally
by
7th
grade
I
got
sick
of
it
and
one
day
raised
my
hand
to
ask
if
I
could
skip
the
rough
draft
and
just
write
a
final.
My
teacher
was
a
bit
taken
aback
and
said
I
could
skip
the
rough
draft
because
I
was
a
good
writer
and
didnOt
need
any
major
feedback.
She
then
continued
to
say
that
she
wished
I
had
asked
her
this
in
private
because
the
other
students
would
still
have
to
write
a
rough
draft.
IOm
not
quite
sure
what
the
other
students
thought
of
this
but
I
was
happy
to
be
done
with
pointless
rough
drafts.
The
only
issue
with
my
writing
in
7th
grade
was
that
I
used
too
many
commas,
which
still
might
be
a
bit
of
an
issue
for
me.
My
teachers
had
always
said
Nadd
a
comma
where
you
pause,O
which
I
tried
to
follow
but
I
guess
I
still
used
them
excessively.
Looking
back,
I
wish
they
had
just
taught
us
grammar
rules
instead
but
I
suppose
they
thought
this
was
easier
and
good
enough
for
13
year
olds.
I
donOt
understand
why
so
many
English
teachers
did
not
formally
teach
us
grammar
rules
and
instead
allowed
us
to
really
on
what
Nsounded
right.O
I
was
still
convinced
I
despised
English
class
until
8th
grade.
Only
in
8th
grade
did
we
really
start
to
discuss
research
papers
and
bibliographies,
which
I
actually
thought
was
very
interesting.
Research
was
very
straight
forward
and
the
format
rules
had
a
very
clear
application.
This
writing
finally
seemed
useful
and
was
actually
interesting
to
do.
It
was
this
year
that
I
learned
about
MLA
format,
which
I
really
enjoyed
because
it
was
an
easy
way
to
organize
my
writings.
I
didnOt
understand
though
why
everyone
complained
about
organizing
their
sources
or
why
they
hated
writing
factual
histories.
They
also
incessantly
complained
about
our
Writers
Inc
book
even
it
was
an
incredibly
clear
and
easy
to
read
book.
Research
was
just
so
straight
forward
and
direct
that
I
actually
liked
going
to
English
class
for
the
first
time
ever!
My
affection
for
English
was
fleeting,
however,
because
when
I
got
to
high
school
and
took
my
first
honors
English
class
in
9th
grade,
I
went
back
to
hating
the
subject.
The
teacher
just
babbled
and
had
ridiculous
quizzes
and
I
absolutely
dreaded
going
to
class.
It
was
also
the
very
last
period
of
the
day,
which
made
it
so
much
worse.
The
papers
we
had
to
write
were
again
self
reflective
D
I
had
to
write
about
a
family
vacation
and
what
we
did,
how
it
was,
etc.
Even
the
books
we
read
were
not
discussed
or
analyzed.
For
example,
one
of
the
books
we
read
was
The
Curious
Incident
of
the
Dog
in
the
Nighttime,
which
was
writing
in
the
first
person
view
of
an
autistic
boy.
Her
weekly
quizzes
focused
ONLY
on
mundane
details
the
narrator
mentioned
so
youOd
have
a
quiz
over
10
chapters
that
asked
you
to
remember
how
many
yellow
cars
the
boy
saw,
how
many
tiles
were
on
the
ground,
and
what
kind
of
plants
he
saw
on
a
car
ride.
These
things
had
no
symbolism
and
had
no
relation
to
the
story
besides
allowing
the
reader
to
better
sympathize
with
the
narrator.
We
also
NreadO
Romeo
and
Juliet
but
the
teacher
never
taught
us
how
to
read
and
understand
Shakespeare
so
we
just
grumbled
about
the
book
and
read
it
off
Spark
Notes
instead.
It
just
was
a
horrible
class
and
I
seriously
wondered
if
my
wonderful
8th
grade
English
class
was
just
a
fluke.
I
again
signed
up
for
Honors
English
my
sophomore
year
because
I
wanted
to
continue
talking
all
honors
classes
even
if
it
was
in
a
subject
I
didnOt
like.
This
was
the
class
though
that
permanently
changed
my
view
of
English
class,
which
I
now
started
to
refer
to
as
Literature.
We
finally
started
to
analyze
stories
and
create
argumentative
essays,
which
was
amazing.
It
seemed
obvious
that
stories
should
have
a
purpose
but
to
actually
dissect
a
story
for
deeper
meaning
and
see
how
various
elements
were
interrelated
was
mindblowing.
This
class
absolutely
transformed
how
I
thought
about
poetry,
literature,
and
persuasive
writing.
Not
only
did
I
finally
appreciate
books
and
saw
them
as
NliteratureO
but
my
writing
vastly
improved.
I
still
hated
doing
reflective
writings
but
I
no
longer
had
to.
The
teacher
always
gave
us
topic
and
project
choices
and
I
was
always
able
to
select
an
argumentative
essay
or
grammar
prompt,
which
completely
suited
me.
This
teacher
was
also
the
one
who
encouraged
me
to
join
the
high
school
debate
team,
which
further
cultivated
my
writing.
It
also
forced
to
learn
how
to
quickly
write
rebuttals.
Learning
to
write
this
way
was
stressful
but
still
extremely
helpful.
IOve
used
this
style
of
writing
on
my
SATs,
GRE,
and
countless
in-class
essays.
Because
the
same
teacher
who
taught
H.
English
10
also
was
in
charge
of
debate,
I
had
fantastic
instruction.
He
really
was
one
of
the
best
teachers
IOve
ever
had,
if
not
the
best
and
is
one
of
the
few
teachers
IOd
be
happy
to
have
again.
At
the
same
time
sophomore
year,
I
was
also
in
AP
History
where
we
also
focused
on
writing
argument
essays.
Whereas
in
my
Lit.
class
we
focused
on
improving
our
writing
(e.g.
how
to
identify
and
avoid
passive
voice)
and
how
to
create
argumentative
essays,
in
AP
History
the
teacher
really
emphasized
NtyingO
our
facts
back
to
our
thesis.
This
teacher
really
hammered
into
us
the
importance
of
showing
why
certain
information
was
important.
Whatever
fact
you
mentioned
had
to
tie
into
your
paragraphOs
contention,
which
in
turn
had
to
support
your
thesis
statement.
This
class
really
complimented
my
Lit
class
and
these
two
classes
were
by
far
the
most
influential
writing
courses
I
have
ever
taken.
During
this
time,
I
also
was
taking
Science
Research,
a
course
that
focused
not
only
on
scientific
writing
but
also
on
how
to
conduct
independent
experiments.
For
this
course
I
learned
APA
style,
poster
and
powerpoint
presentations,
how
to
create
literature
reviews,
and
how
to
create
a
formal
scientific
paper.
Although
this
process
could
be
infuriating
(particularly
formatting
images
within
the
paper),
it
was
incredibly
rewarding
and
I
again
enjoyed
learning
a
new
writing
style.
Winning
awards
for
my
research
also
proved
to
me
that
I
could
write
well
(and
conduct
well-planned
experiments)
so
that
was
extremely
rewarding.
The
rest
of
my
high
school
writing
career
stayed
basically
the
same.
I
continued
to
do
debate
and
continued
to
do
well.
My
H.
English
11
teacher
taught
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
H.
English
10
teacher,
which
served
as
a
great
reinforcement
of
what
I
had
learned.
This
teacher
also
wanted
even
more
insightful
analysis,
which
forced
students
to
sharpen
our
analytical
skills.
Although
the
AP
Literature
teacher
my
senior
year
was
not
very
organized
and
didnOt
demand
insightful
literary
analysis,
I
already
knew
how
to
effectively
write
so
I
didnOt
really
mind
or
feel
cheated.
I
also
learned
another
editorial
style,
the
Turabian
Chicago
Manual
of
Style,
when
I
took
a
history
class
at
the
University
of
Toledo
the
summer
between
sophomore
and
junior
years
of
high
school.
The
Turabian
style
was
extremely
specific
and
at
times
a
bit
annoying
(especially
the
bibliography
section)
but
I
enjoyed
learning
another
format
even
though
IOve
never
had
a
cause
to
use
it
again.
When
I
came
to
Lafayette,
I
felt
completely
prepared
for
college
writing.
During
my
FYS
and
VAST
courses,
I
easily
earned
As
on
my
papers
but
was
a
bit
surprised
at
how
the
classes
were
conducted,
particularly
the
FYS
class.
The
college
insists
that
students
purchase
St.
MartinOs
Handbook
but
then
FYS
teachers
donOt
do
anything
with
the
book
and
donOt
even
teach
students
how
to
write.
I
assumed
the
professor
would
discuss
how
to
create
and
support
contentions,
how
to
cite
sources,
etc
but
he
only
discussed
the
FYS
topic
and
nothing
else.
I
thought
the
essay
writing
was
easy
but
I
saw
how
many
of
the
students
in
the
class
were
struggling.
I
soon
became
the
official
essay
grader
amongst
my
friends;
particularly
my
international
friends
who
needed
more
grammar
help.
I
actually
really
enjoyed
grading
their
papers
and
providing
them
with
feedback.
I
did
lots
of
paper
grading
in
high
school
because
I
volunteered
to
be
a
teaching
assistant
to
my
H.
English
10
teacher
and
I
always
found
grading
strangely
relaxing.
Combing
through
sentence
structure
and
various
arguments
has
a
set
method,
which
I
found
easy
and
interesting
to
do.
The
next
type
of
writing
I
learned
was
lab
report
writing
for
my
chemical
engineering
classes.
Even
though
I
knew
how
to
write
scientific
papers,
I
was
surprised
at
just
how
different
of
a
writing
style
lab
reports
are.
Although
I
generally
enjoy
writing
scientific
papers,
I
still
havenOt
warmed
up
to
lab
reports.
They
are
exhausting
and
tedious.
Trying
to
finish
them
in
a
week
is
also
difficult
but
I
suppose
I
just
need
more
practice.
Having
a
more
focused
discussion
on
how
to
write
lab
reports
would
also
be
extremely
helpful
rather
than
the
Nfigure
it
out
as
youO
method
the
department
currently
employs.
In
the
past
twenty
years,
my
writing
has
matured
to
a
very
dry
and
fairly
straight-forward
style.
Because
my
writing
is
pretty
dry
though,
IOm
much
more
comfortable
writing
argumentative
and
scientific
papers
rather
than
reflective
or
creative
essays.
Reflective
and
creative
writings
need
to
be
dynamic
and
IOm
always
unsure
of
how
I
should
alter
my
writing
(even
though
I
know
what
writing
styles
I
enjoy
and
I
love
reading
literature).
Overall,
I
know
my
strengths
and
IOm
lucky
that
those
happen
to
be
my
main
interests.
IOm
still
hopeful
though
that
when
I
attend
grad
school
my
writing
can
still
continue
to
develop.
