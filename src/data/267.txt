The
capacity
to
write
is
an
evil
curse.
In
an
attempt
to
convey
a
point
or
elicit
a
response
from
the
reader,
a
writer
must
reach
inside
the
human
mind
and
assemble
sometimes
very
confusing
thought.
This
is
an
agonizingly
painful
process
in
itself
(i.e.,
writer's
block).
Furthermore,
the
writer
seeks
more
than
just
a
simple
path
from
A
to
B
(A
being
the
writer's
words
and
B
being
the
reader's
comprehension
of
these
words).
There
must
be
something
in
between!
Else,
why
would
anyone
in
their
right
mind
read
what
is
written?
To
write
is
to
be
blessed.
It's
right
up
there
with
a
baseball
game
under
the
lights
at
Yankee
Stadium
and
a
lazy
Sunday
afternoon
in
the
archive
of
cherished
human
activities.
We
(most
of
us)
move
our
eyes
over
a
page
from
left
to
right
and
absorb
someone
else's
written
ideas.
Tangible
human
thought!
It's
just
shy
of
a
miracle,
right?
And
writers
aren't
simply
out
to
tell
you
what's
on
their
mind;
they
can
tell
stories
or
defend
a
thesis
as
well.
Writing
is
a
unique
gift
with
millions
of
witnesses
to
proclaim
its
might.
No
matter
where
one
stands
on
the
issue
of
writing
at
this
very
moment
they
would
be
hard-pressed
to
deny
the
existence
of
both
the
dark
side
and
the
sunshine
in
the
writing
realm.
And
so
it
is
with
every
writing
assignment
that
the
writer
develops
and
grows
accustomed
to
the
rugged
rollercoaster
ride
that
I've
outlined
above.
For
me,
the
past
year
couldn't
have
been
more
instrumental
in
detailing
how
to
coast
for
the
entire
ride.
Undoubtedly,
the
most
formative
experience
of
the
past
year
occurred
during
my
time
as
a
WA.
First
and
foremost,
it's
obvious,
but
still
vital,
to
point
out
the
new
perspective
gained
from
serving
as
a
peer
editor.
It
used
to
be
commonplace
in
my
world
of
academia
to
hand
in
a
paper,
cross
my
fingers
and
hope
for
the
best
a
week
or
so
later.
The
story
is
much
different
nowadays.
The
phrase
"rough
draft"
is
no
longer
an
excuse
for
a
crappy
paper;
it
is
an
integral
part
of
the
paper.
The
draft
is
read
and
analyzed,
not
simply
for
those
sneaky
spelling
errors
or
the
inconspicuous
absence
of
punctuation,
but
for
Higher
Order
Concerns
that
make
or
break
a
paper.
And
herein
lies
the
foundation
of
the
WA-student
conference.
My
first
conferences
as
a
WA
were
spent,
for
the
most
part,
feeling
around
for
The
Way.
That
is,
I
needed
to
develop
the
niche
that
would
work
best
under
the
circumstances
of
a
typical
conference.
I
thought
a
mold
such
as
this
would
help
me
strategize
for
each
student.
Well,
this
idea
was
immediately
thrown
out
the
window
since
each
student
required
his
or
her
own
subtle
interaction.
From
this
acknowledgment
stemmed
the
idea
that
each
writer
has
his
or
her
own
history
as
a
writer
(the
idea
is
of
course
the
cornerstone
of
the
WA's
summer
writing
project).
This
meant
that
I
should
not,
in
all
my
wonderful
goodness,
take
for
granted
that
a
student
possesses
certain
knowledge.
Not
long
after,
I
started
to
realize
the
good
that
was
coming
out
of
each
and
every
conference.
On
the
surface,
I
was
acting
as
a
third
party
reader
with
the
authority
of
the
College
Writing
Program
stamped
on
my
forehead.
This
role
is
usually
limited
to
the
first
time
a
WA
sees
a
student,
with
the
subsequent
conferences
acting
to
erase
the
stamp's
imprint.
On
a
deeper
level,
I
was
studying
an
individual's
written
work
and
discussing
it
in
an
intelligent
manner.
This
role
proved
to
be
the
core
of
this
whole
dam
thing!
Respect
travels
in
both
directions.
Both
parties
win
in
the
end.
As
a
WA,
I
was
exposed
to
many
different
writing
styles,
interesting
theses,
grammatical
mistakes,
and
structural
defects.
I've
seen
it
all!
(Well,
some
of
it
at
least.)
My
exposure
alone
allowed
me
to
assume
a
bird's
eye
view
of
the
wide
breadth
of
writers
out
there.
Needless
to
say,
it
also
improved
my
own
methods
and
techniques
of
writing.
I
was
able
to
focus
in
on
what
works
and
what
doesn't.
Detached
from
the
students
(as
opposed
to
personal
attachment
to
my
own
writing),
I
could
freely
criticize
the
work
of
others
without
bias
or
fear.
In
WA
staff
meetings
I
reveled
in
learning
about
typically
unwritten
concepts
such
as
flow
and
the
effects
of
punctuation
placement.
Talking
openly
about
such
topics
acted
as
sort
of
an
addendum
to
usual
writing
and
literature
courses.
It
was
certainly
beneficial
to
hear
about
the
concerns
of
the
other
WAs'
students.
More
than
anything,
the
staff
meetings
brought
together
a
diverse
sample
of
WAs
that
shared
their
personal
writing
history
and,
occasionally,
the
history
of
their
students.
In
terms
of
my
academic
writing,
several
experiences
over
the
past
year
stand
out.
There
is
very
little
doubt
in
my
mind
that
they
have
immensely
contributed
to
my
improvement
as
a
writer.
One
such
experience
had
me
delving
into
a
wide
variety
of
literary
works
and
analyzing
both
the
text
and
context
from
unique
critical
viewpoints.
In
other
words,
I
might
find
my
strongest
argument
for
a
thesis
by
examining,
and
ultimately
searching
for,
the
"holes"
in
the
text
that
make
the
work
as
a
whole
seem
incongruous.
Or,
I
might
find
it
necessary
to
investigate
the
work
through
a
psychological
mindset
whereby
the
long-standing
accomplishments
of
icons
such
as
Freud
come
into
play.
These
and
a
cluster
of
other
methods
are
employed
in
order
to
focus
a
thesis
in
a
specific
direction.
I
found
the
discipline
that
is
inevitably
attached
to
the
aforementioned
process
to
be
readily
beneficial.
After
reading
about
each
of
the
methods
and
learning
to
understand
some
of
the
examples,
I
developed
a
keen
eye
for
what
method
works
best
when
given
a
specific
piece
of
literature.
I
now
had
a
shiny
new
lens
through
which
I
could
study
a
vast
array
of
writing.
Another
experience
(which
was
more
of
a
collective
experience
than
any
single
course
or
assignment)
alluded
to
the
importance
of
catching
and
maintaining
the
fickle
attention
of
the
audience.
Both
in
and
out
of
the
classroom
I
could
not
deny
the
existence
of
a
writer's
mandate
to
make
their
writing
interesting.
Of
course,
it
is
worth
noting
that
anyone
around
the
formal
process
of
writing
will
probably
recognize
this
mandate
as
inherent
in
the
writer's
nature
and
therefore
trivial.
But
I
think
it
should
always
be
on
the
writer's
mind.
There
are
examples
abound
where
the
work
of
writers
is
stagnant
and,
with
all
due
respect,
dead.
Whether
it's
the
banality
of
the
language,
the
monotonous
repetition
of
an
idea,
or
the
general
idiocy
of
the
author,
writing
is
more
than
susceptible
to
germs
of
indifference.
Looking
at
it
in
another
way,
chances
are,
if
the
writer
is
not
enthused,
the
reader
won't
be
either.
More
important
than
any
of
my
romantic
writing
tales,
however,
was
being
able
to
pinpoint
some
of
my
weaknesses
that
continue
to
thwart
my
vision
of
becoming
an
esteemed
author.
I,
more
than
anyone
perhaps,
have
encountered
speedbumps
that
more
than
live
up
to
their
name.
Recently,
I've
discovered
my
unfortunate
knack
for
writing
in
a
style
consistent
with
the
way
I
speak
aloud.
This,
at
first
glance,
may
appear
petty.
But
upon
further
examination,
I
find
that
I
sometimes
sacrifice
clarity
and
my
intended
humor
for
what
I
initially
consider
witty
sarcasm
or
irony.
Only
outside
readers
were
capable
of
calling
my
attention
to
this
infirmity.
My
rookie
year
as
a
WA
in
conjunction
with
several
instances
that
required
third
party
proofreaders
hi-lited
the
weakness
in
my
writing.
Note:
Being
a
WA
and
meeting
with
my
WA
was
not
awkward
or
wasteful
whatsoever.
In
fact,
our
conferences
were
quite
enlightening.
It
was
humbling
to
observe
how
desperately
I
needed
the
services
of
a
WA
for
my
own
writing.
Similarly,
I
now
realize
that
everything
I
write
(I
repeat
for
emphasis:
everything)
contains
some
degree
of
subject
matter,
phrasing,
word
choice,
etc.,
that
some
readers
will
not
understand
on
their
own.
As
I've
mentioned
earlier,
it
is
my
duty
to
correct
this
problem.
It
is
not
as
daunting
a
task
as
it
may
first
appear,
however,
especially
under
the
auspices
of
a
WA
conference.
And
my
own
WA
experience
has
taught
me
how
to
look
at
a
paper
as
impartially
as
possible
in
order
to
be
as
fair
and
just
as
possible.
It
is
in
such
a
mode
that
I
am
able
to
pick
up
on
the
confusing
jumps
from
sentence
to
sentence
within
my
writing.
My
summer
has
shed
light
on
a
relatively
well-documented
facet
of
literature
and
writing.
It
has
become
increasingly
evident
the
extent
to
which
established
authors
influence
my
own
writing.
That
is,
my
reading
history
(books,
magazines,
journal
entries,
etc.)
indeed
shows
up
in
varied
forms
in
my
writings.
For
example,
as
a
big
fan
of
author
Kurt
Vonnegut,
I
sometimes
find
myself
uttering
the
same
kind
of
satirical
tone
that
Vonnegut
novels
are
endlessly
praised
for.
This
so-called
sphere
of
influence
is
undoubtedly
a
cyclical,
never-ending
process
which
I'm
glad
to
be
a
part
of
(with
all
due
modesty).
Contrary
to
some
critics
(and
writers)
who
appear
defeated
by
this
point,
I
welcome
the
fact.
When
I
think
about
it,
actually,
I'm
invigorated
to
read
more
and
take
on
the
skills
and
talent
of
authors
of
past
and
present.
On
a
similar
note,
this
past
summer
has
reinforced
the
notion
that
the
more
one
reads,
the
better
the
writer
will
become.
Lacking
the
stringent
schedule
of
classes
and
meetings,
the
summer
provides
ample
time
and
energy
to
read
and
be
free.
When
the
summer
months
of
July
and
August
pass
through
so
does
a
breeze
of
creative
inspiration.
Reading
creates
new
avenues
and
open
doors
to
explore
different
styles
and
content.
Even
by
reading
news
magazines
and
scholarly
articles
in
academic
journals
I've
maintained
and
surpassed
my
ongoing
thirst
for
additional
writing
knowledge.
Graduating
into
a
veteran
WA
position,
I
can
only
imagine
how
unprofessional
and
juvenile
the
up
and
coming
WAs
must
feel.
As
a
result,
I
feel
compelled
to
offer
some
semblance
of
advice:
Dear
New
WAs,
I
think
it
is
in
your
own
best
interest
to
identify
one
aspect
of
the
writer's
draft
in
which
refinement
can
improve
the
overall
quality
of
the
paper.
This
aspect
will
represent
the
primary
goal
of
the
conference.
I
think
this
should
be
done
for
two
important
reasons:
1)
to
prevent
the
WA
from
just
skimming
the
surface
of
the
draft
without
hitting
on
any
major
concepts
(i.e.,
structure,
thesis
development,
explanation),
and
2)
to
set
the
bar
for
the
WA
giving
him
or
her
a
concrete
objective.
Also,
I
stress
being
open-minded
to
change,
particularly
to
suggestions
by
other
WAs
or
professors.
Most
of
your
seemingly
invincible
statutes
about
writing
will
be
challenged
in
the
course
of
your
WA-dom.
The
fun
part
will
be
deciding
what
advice
to
adopt
and
what
to
disregard.
Finally,
make
sure
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
deal.
Be
a
WA's
student!
Pay
attention
to
how
they
are
successful
and
how
they
fail
during
a
conference.
Moreover,
talk
to
as
many
WAs
as
you
can.
While
the
students
you
WA
are
more
or
less
peers,
the
WAs
you
WA
with
are
also
very
much
peers
with
enriching
anecdotes
and
lessons.
The
near
future
is
nearer
than
I
know.
My
sophomore
year
of
WA-dom
will
surely
bring
more
of
the
ups
and
downs
that
I've
mentioned.
But,
with
the
risk
of
sounding
pretentious,
I
am
considerably
more
confident
as
I
throw
on
the
uniform
for
another
year.
I
submerged
my
feet
in
the
water
and
remained
standing
despite
the
reverent
strength
of
the
current.
My
experience
provided
numerous
tools
to
use
in
the
future
and
a
wonderful
feeling
of
accomplishment
that
will
(knock
on
wood)
continue
in
the
next
academic
year.
I
will,
nevertheless,
begin
the
year
with
a
keen
ear,
listening
for
new
methods
to
try
and
old
convictions
to
give
up.
All
in
a
year's
work!
