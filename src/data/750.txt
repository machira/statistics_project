My
History
as
a
Writer
It
was
the
beginning
of
first
grade;
the
teacher
had
just
finished
giving
the
class
the
instructions
and
was
now
handing
out
blank,
9x12,
white
hardcover
books.
I
was
so
excited
because
it
was
finally
my
opportunity
to
show
the
world
just
how
talented
I
really
was.
I
had
been
reading
storybooks
all
my
life,
and
now
it
was
my
turn.
The
ideas
and
the
possibilities
were
endless
as
I
poured
my
heart
and
soul
into
this
project,
honestly
believing
that
one
day
this
book
would
be
published
for
the
world
to
see.
The
finished
product
was
a
story
called
NStaten
Island
Chuck
Meets
Punxsutawney
PhilO
written
and
illustrated
by
yours
truly.
This
cheesy
story
about
the
two
famous
groundhogs
meeting
and
becoming
friends
was
my
first
real
attempt
at
writing.
I
still
keep
this
book
in
my
bookcase
and
occasionally
look
through
it,
just
to
reminisce
about
the
excitement
of
my
first
real
writing
project.
My
next
two
years
in
school
I
continued
to
develop
my
story
telling
skills
by
making
two
more
of
these
books.
In
second
grade
I
wrote
NMy
Trip
To
JupiterO,
which
was
a
story
about
a
family
who
got
blown
away
in
a
skydiving
accident
and
ended
up
landing
on
Jupiter.
Obviously,
the
realism
wasnOt
quite
there
yet,
but
the
creativity
sure
was.
In
third
grade
however,
I
made
big
strides
with
NThe
Snowflake
of
MiraclesO.
It
is
the
story
of
a
homeless
man
who
is
hit
with
a
magic
snowflake
that
gives
him
all
the
riches
in
the
world;
however
instead
of
keeping
these
riches
to
himself,
he
distributes
them
to
the
poor
and
eliminates
poverty.
This
book
won
in
the
school
story
telling
contest.
It
was
my
first
real
writing
award.
I
got
a
special
certificate
and
won
the
25
dollar
grand
prize.
I
could
not
have
been
any
happier.
While
these
three
years
helped
provide
the
building
blocks
for
the
writer
I
would
become,
fourth
grade
was
truly
a
challenge
that
helped
my
become
a
more
technically
skilled
writer.
Every
month
our
teacher
would
hand
out
a
list
of
famous
people
born
in
that
month,
and
from
that
list
we
each
had
to
choose
two
that
we
wanted
to
focus
on.
Our
assignment
was
to
type
a
one-page
long
biography
for
each
person
and
be
prepared
to
share
it
with
the
class.
At
the
time
I
absolutely
hated
these
assignments
for
two
major
reasons.
Firstly,
I
had
never
used
a
computer
before,
and
I
had
no
idea
how
to
type.
All
my
writing
was
done
with
pencil
up
until
that
point.
Secondly,
a
page
long
essay
in
fourth
grade
is
equivalent
to
a
20
page
essay
in
college;
absolute
hell.
I
would
use
Microsoft
Encarta
to
research
these
famous
figures
in
history
and
type
up
the
biography.
Doing
this
twice
a
month,
every
month
of
the
school
year
was
such
torture
for
a
fourth
grader,
but
by
the
end
of
the
year,
there
was
most
definitely
an
improvement
in
my
writing
skills
and
my
typing
skills.
These
biographies
were
my
first
major
assignments
in
which
I
was
not
supposed
to
be
creative
and
tell
a
story,
but
rather
report
my
findings.
To
this
day,
as
much
as
I
did
not
enjoy
doing
them
at
the
time,
I
am
grateful
I
had
to
do
them,
because
it
really
helped
broaden
my
understanding
of
what
writing
is
really
all
about.
The
skills
taken
away
from
my
fourth
grade
biographies
came
in
handy
in
sixth
grade
when
my
English
teacher
entered
my
whole
class
into
the
city
wide
Police
Athletic
League
of
New
YorkOs
annual
NStories
My
Grandparents
Told
MeO
contest.
I
sat
down
with
my
Pop
Pop,
who
died
less
than
a
year
later,
and
asked
him
to
tell
me
all
about
his
early
years.
We
sat
for
well
over
an
hour
as
he
spoke
and
I
took
notes.
When
I
went
to
turn
my
notes
into
a
full
essay,
I
had
trouble
at
first,
as
I
had
never
done
that
before.
When
I
was
finally
able
to
get
it
started
however,
the
words
were
flowing
and
before
I
knew
it,
three
pages
were
filled.
I
wrote
about
my
Pop
PopOs
experiences
in
his
family
fish
market,
which
he
eventually
took
over.
I
wrote
about
how
he
and
his
six
siblings
would
cause
mischief,
and
how
he
met
my
grandmother.
The
pride
I
felt
when
I
handed
in
that
essay
matched
the
feeling
I
felt
when
I
finished
my
first
book.
To
my
surprise,
I
received
a
letter
in
the
mail
a
few
weeks
later
saying
that
my
essay
had
won
a
first
prize
in
the
PAL
Contest.
I
was
invited
along
with
my
family
to
a
formal
ceremony
where
I
received
a
plaque
that
I
have
hanging
in
my
basement
to
this
day.
It
was
truly
a
special
day,
especially
when
I
got
the
see
the
smile
on
my
Pop
Pops
face
as
I
walked
on
stage
to
receive
my
award.
It
was
truly
my
best
experience
as
a
writer.
For
the
rest
of
my
life,
I
will
never
forget
that
scene,
which
was
made
possible
by
the
writing
skills
and
creativity
I
was
able
to
develop
in
my
first
few
years
of
school.
Once
I
got
to
high
school,
my
writing
was
strong
enough
for
me
to
be
placed
in
the
Advanced
Placement
English
class.
In
these
classes
we
had
to
read
a
lot.
There
were
countless
difficult
works
of
poetry,
the
plays
of
Shakespeare
and
HomerOs
The
Iliad
and
The
Odyssey
just
to
name
a
few.
After
almost
everything
we
read,
we
had
to
write
a
argumentative
paper
answering
a
specific
question
posed
by
the
teacher.
There
was
no
right
or
wrong
answer,
but
our
job
was
to
make
the
teacher
believe
that
our
answer
was
in
fact
the
right
one
by
using
supporting
facts
and
shutting
down
any
counter
arguments
that
could
be
made.
These
papers
were
long
and
tedious
but
were
definitely
helpful
in
that
they
forced
us
to
not
only
report
facts,
as
I
had
grown
so
accustomed
to,
but
rather
attempt
to
convince
someone
of
something
by
using
these
facts
strategically.
We
also
did
exercises
that
were
designed
to
prepare
us
for
the
AP
test.
At
the
beginning
of
class
the
teacher
would
give
us
a
controversial
topic
to
write
about
and
we
would
have
the
entire
45
minute
period
to
write.
These
assignments
forced
us
to
think
quickly
and
develop
our
ideas
as
fast
and
effectively
as
possible.
The
next
day
the
teacher
would
return
our
responses
and
the
entire
page
would
be
covered
in
red.
She
would
grade
them
very
harshly
on
purpose
to
force
us
to
strive
to
improve,
which
I
did.
Throughout
my
high
school
career,
all
of
my
teachers
had
been
very
supportive
in
regards
to
my
writing.
I
received
a
lot
of
praise,
and
even
when
I
was
criticized,
it
was
very
constructive
and
designed
to
help
me.
By
the
time
the
AP
test
rolled
around
I
aced
it
with
a
4,
and
received
college
credits,
therefore
placing
out
of
English
101.
Because
of
this,
I
felt
more
than
adequately
prepared
for
college
writing
when
I
graduated
high
school.
Unfortunately,
when
I
got
to
college
I
had
a
nasty
little
wake
up
call.
As
a
government
and
law
major,
I
had
to
analyze
MachiavelliOs
The
Prince
for
the
first
paper
of
my
college
career.
I
was
a
strong
writer
in
high
school
and
everyone
had
always
positively
viewed
my
work,
so
naturally
when
I
handed
in
my
paper,
I
was
fairly
confident.
I
expected
college
writing
to
be
difficult,
but
I
believed
I
would
have
no
problem
making
the
transition
from
high
school
to
college.
Well
I
was
sorely
mistaken.
When
I
got
that
paper
back
I
was
shocked
to
see
a
giant
red
C-
at
the
top
of
the
page.
I
was
so
confused,
as
I
had
never
received
a
less
than
a
B
in
my
entire
life.
The
criticism
written
throughout
my
paper
was
harsh
and
something
I
was
totally
unaccustomed
to,
and
that
feeling
of
Noh
crap,
college
is
the
real
deal,
maybe
IOm
not
as
prepared
as
I
thoughtO
was
running
through
my
head
non-stop.
This
was
by
far
my
worst
experience
as
a
writer.
I
decided
to
visit
the
teacher
during
office
hours
and
speak
about
my
poor
grade
with
hopes
that
he
would
apologize
for
the
mistake
and
raise
my
grade
on
the
spot,
but
unfortunately
that
didnOt
happen.
However
he
was
very
understanding.
He
was
willing
to
take
time
to
answer
my
questions
and
work
with
me
until
I
understood
exactly
what
went
wrong.
I
left
that
meeting
taking
away
two
things,
first,
donOt
summarize
plot
more
than
you
have
to.
That
was
nailed
into
my
head
pretty
thoroughly.
And
second,
the
college
professors
are
more
than
happy
to
work
with
you
if
you
show
that
you
are
concerned
and
interested.
This
experience
taught
me
that
although
college
writing
is
difficult,
if
you
put
in
the
effort
and
show
the
professors
that
you
are
trying
your
best,
they
will
do
all
they
can
to
help
you
succeed
as
well.
Throughout
my
years
of
writing,
the
many
people
who
have
read
my
work
have
always
been
supportive
and
constructive,
and
I
believe
that
has
helped
to
make
me
a
better
writer.
Growing
up,
my
family,
especially
my
mother,
has
always
been
there
to
proofread
my
work
and
help
make
improvements.
This
confidence
I
have
gained
has
helped
me
to
help
others
now.
When
I
am
home
from
school
I
often
help
out
my
younger
brother
with
his
writing,
by
proofreading
and
editing
his
papers.
It
is
a
rewarding
feeling
to
be
able
to
help
out
others
with
their
writing
and
it
makes
me
appreciate
the
help
others
have
offered
me
throughout
my
years
even
more.
