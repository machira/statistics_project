1998
From
Pencils
to
PC's
It
was
with
a
dull
lead
pencil
and
a
large-ruled
marble
copybook
that
I
began
my
journey
into
the
world
of
writing,
and
I
certainly
did
not
think
it
would
take
me
to
this
destination.
My
first
story
was
entitled,
"How
the
Leopard
Got
his
Spots/'
and
followed
Spotty
the
leopard
through
the
jungle
for
three
pages
until
he
fell
into
a
mud
puddle,
thus
earning
his
spots.
I
can
still
remember
writing
it
and
my
excitement
when
I
received
an
A+
for
it.
That
was
in
sixth
grade
and
apart
from
two
other
short
stories
written
that
year,
it
was
my
first
and
only
formal
writing
assignment
in
elementary
school.
Thankfully
it
was
a
very
positive
experience
because
I
have
always
regarded
writing,
whether
it
be
a
thank-you
note
or
a
term
paper,
as
a
dark
and
overbearing
cloud
of
dread.
Perhaps
it
is
my
lack
of
experience
that
has
caused
me
to
dread
writing
or
perhaps
some
wonderful
chemical
imbalance
is
to
blame.
Either
way,
my
story
of
Spotty
the
leopard
paved
my
way
as
a
writer.
No
matter
what
bitter
feelings
I
had
towards
an
assignment,
I
have
always
known
that
I
would
somehow
receive
a
good
grade
for
it.
It
is
that
knowledge
which
has
given
me
the
confidence
to
be
a
good
writer.
Though
it
has
been
tried
many
times,
that
confidence
is
what
gets
me
through
every
assignment
and
the
history
of
those
assignments
is
what
has
lead
me
to
be
the
writer
here
today.
It
is
fairly
obvious
that
my
school
was
never
adamant
about
writing
papers.
Up
until
that
point
in
sixth
grade
the
only
writing
I
had
done
involved
short
answers
to
religion
or
social
studies'
questions.
However,
this
proved
to
be
a
very
valuable
form
of
writing
I
now
realize.
Writing
those
short,
three-sentence
answers
shaped
my
focus
as
a
writer.
I
learned
to
find
the
argument,
define
it,
and
then
elaborate.
I
see
it
now
as
early
thesis
practice.
This
genre
of
writing
continued
throughout
my
elementary
years
and
my
freshmen
year
of
high
school.
It
was
not
until
my
sophomore
year
that
I
had
a
rude
awakening.
I
do
not
think
I
have
ever
been
as
frustrated
with
a
teacher
as
with
Mr.
Demczko,
my
sophomore
English
teacher.
I
realized
by
the
first
week
of
class
that
I
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
writing.
I
swore
I
would
scream
if
I
ever
heard
the
words,
'Intelligent
Discourse,"
again.
However,
I
soon
settled
down
when
I
realized
I
was
not
alone
in
his
class
and
that
this
must
be
just
as
frustrating
for
him.
He
introduced
us
to
many
different
types
of
writing
including
short
essays,
sonnets,
ballads,
and
poems.
It
seemed
pointless
at
the
time
trying
to
write
perfect
meter
and
rhythm,
but
it
was
forcing
us
to
think.
Mr.
Demczko
also
introduced
structure
and
the
thesis
statement
to
our
writing,
which
I
had
just
assumed
came
naturally
to
all
papers.
I
was
quickly
proven
wrong.
Fortunately
though,
I
have
always
been
a
good
student
so
I
caught
on
quickly.
Once
again
I
began
to
consider
myself
a
good
writer
and
was
receiving
high
grades.
Then
I
entered
my
junior
year
however,
and
realized
it
was
time
to
start
over
again.
While
sophomore
English
had
been
fun,
the
Academic
Writing
course
I
took
my
junior
year
was
not.
It
was
in
this
class
that
I
learned
about
the
mechanics
of
writing
such
as
MLA
style,
transitions,
and
the
different
types
of
arguments,
like
compare
and
contrast.
I
felt
I
understood
each
of
these
but
apparently
my
teacher,
Ms.
Wufsus,
did
not.
It
was
in
her
class
that
I
truly
began
to
dread
writing.
My
confidence
began
to
slip
and
I
started
bringing
home
C's
instead
of
A's.
I
almost
gave
up
hope
but
then
I
noticed
that
those
around
me
were
doing
well.
Thankfully,
I
am
an
extremely
competitive
person
and
I
refused
to
be
beaten.
Even
though
I
seemed
to
dread
every
sentence
I
wrote,
I
was
determined
to
prove
that
I
was
a
good
writer,
if
only
to
myself.
Finally
our
last
assignment
was
given
-
the
seven
page
term
paper.
I
once
again
believed
that
writing
was
fun
as
I
researched
my
chosen
topic,
psychokinesis,
and
actually
enjoyed
writing
the
final
product.
I
did
very
well
on
that
paper
but
I
still
cringe
whenever
I
think
of
that
loathsome
class.
It
shook
my
precious
confidence,
leaving
an
ugly,
oily
smudge
on
my
image
of
writing.
Senior
year
was
much
better,
primarily
because
I
did
not
take
any
English
classes.
However,
it
was
this
year
that
has
shaped
me
most
to
be
the
writer
I
am
today.
Although
I
had
no
formal
writing
classes
I
had
many
different
opportunities
to
develop
my
writing
skills.
Firstly,
I
took
a
philosophy
class
that
involved
a
lot
of
free
writing.
The
teacher
did
not
care
about
structure
or
thesis,
only
about
content
and
depth.
Since
I
love
philosophy
I
had
no
trouble
writing
pages
and
pages
on
the
subject.
I
learned
to
focus
on
the
meaning
of
a
subject
and
elaborate
on
its
every
detail.
In
time,
the
structure
followed.
My
second
opportunity
to
improve
my
writing
skills
that
year
took
place
in
Shakespeare
class
with
my
dreaded
teacher,
Ms.
Wufsus.
As
if
dissecting
Shakespeare's
works
did
not
prove
challenging
enough,
we
then
had
to
explain
it
in
writing.
Once
we
were
able
to
do
that,
we
began
re-writing
Shakespeare's
plays
into
everyday
language
and
then
performing
them.
My
personal
favorite
was
adapting
Othello
to
life
in
the
nineties
as
a
gangster
in
the
'hood.
As
our
final
exam
we
were
to
re-write
A
Midsummer
Night
s
Dream
so
that
all
five
acts
could
be
performed,
by
our
class,
within
one
hour.
After
two
months,
we
had
read,
dissected,
cut-out
scenes
and
created
them
to
produce
our
final
product.
Although
the
play
was
not
exactly
written
by
our
class,
it
taught
us
a
lot
about
word
choice,
cohesion,
and
conveying
emotion
through
a
written
work.
The
Shakespeare
class
also
taught
me
how
to
articulate
difficult
thoughts
into
common
language,
which
is
the
goal
of
any
writer.
My
third
opportunity
that
year
proved
to
be
the
turning
point
in
my
writing.
Due
to
scheduling
problems,
I
was
unable
to
take
World
Cultures
with
the
rest
of
my
class.
Instead,
the
school
agreed
to
let
me
sit
in
the
library
for
an
hour
each
day
and
read
the
textbook,
virtually
teaching
myself.
My
only
testing
was
to
write
a
five
page
paper
each
month
on
any
topic
I
chose
from
the
six-hundred
page
book.
This
was
amazing!
Although
I
do
not
remember
much
about
World
Cultures
now,
I
could
tell
you
anything
about
the
philosophy
of
Taoism,
the
Roman
gods,
the
Bubonic
plague,
the
Hundred
Day
War,
or
the
bombing
at
Hiroshima.
Through
this
class
I
once
again
learned
that
writing,
as
well
as
researching,
can
be
fim.
Most
importantly
though,
I
was
able
to
"practice"
my
writing.
I
soon
began
to
fall
into
a
rhythm
when
writing
and
was
able
to
define
my
style
as
a
writer.
Perhaps
the
most
valuable
aspect
I
learned
from
that
class
though
was
time
management.
I
have
mentioned
that
I
dread
writing
but
that
is
because
a
paper
would
take
me
days
to
write.
Although
most
people
still
laugh
at
me,
the
fact
that
I
can
write
a
first
draft
within
eight
hours
amazes
me.
Even
with
all
of
these
positive
experiences
though,
I
knew
college
was
going
to
be
totally
different
and
I
was
prepared
for
the
worst.
I
had
extremely
high
college
expectations.
Although
I
had
had
confidence
in
high
school
that
I
would
always
receive
good
grades,
I
knew
not
to
be
that
foolish
in
college.
I
did
feel
that
I
was
adequately
prepared
for
college
writing,
meaning
that
I
was
able
to
write
a
seven
page
paper
intelligently
and
swiftly.
However,
I
thought
that
everyone
must
have
had
the
same
fanatic
English
teachers
that
I
had.
My
only
goal
was
to
pass;
I
never
would
have
expected
to
earn
an
A.
Although
I
admit
that
my
expectations
were
(thankfully)
too
high,
I
had
an
equal
balance
between
good
and
bad
times.
The
introduction
to
month
deadlines
and
a
writing
associate,
as
well
as
my
strong
background,
still
were
sprinkled
with
my
unhappy
all-nighter,
pages
of
revisions,
and
battles
with
writer's
block.
Overall
though,
I
feel
my
first
year
of
college
writing
was
a
positive
experience.
My
First
Year
Seminar
was
far
from
the
nightmare
I
expected.
All
of
the
assignments
were
on
interesting
topics,
such
as
comparing
and
contrasting
the
movies
Boyz
N
the
Hood
and
Goodfellas.
Also,
each
assignment
was
seen
as
a
month
long
process
broken
down
into
sections.
What
was
foreign
to
me
however,
were
revisions.
Never
had
I
written
more
than
one
draft
of
a
paper
throughout
my
entire
high
school
career.
Perhaps
this
is
why
I
had
found
writing
so
long
and
arduous.
I
had
always
viewed
revising
as
starting
over,
and
thus
counter-productive.
However
I
still
had
to
try,
even
if
my
first
revised
papers
included
only
editing
tasks.
Although
my
FYS
appeared
to
be
running
smoothly,
it
only
took
one
night
to
steal
all
of
my
confidence.
It
was
the
last
assignment
of
the
semester
and
I
had
spent
the
previous
two
weeks
researching
my
topic:
Is
Aggression
Innate
or
Learned.
I
knew
that
I
needed
a
solid
background
for
this
paper
and
I
felt
I
was
prepared,
but
I
did
not
even
know
the
answer
to
my
own
question!
By
the
end
of
the
night
I
felt
I
would
go
blind
if
I
had
to
stare
at
that
blank
computer
screen
any
longer.
Although
it
was
only
the
first
draft
of
the
paper,
our
professor
still
collected
them
to
hand
to
our
Writing
Associate.
I
needed
to
write
something,
but
I
just
could
not
think.
I
had
always
had
the
confidence
that
any
assignment
would
somehow
be
completed,
but
not
this
one.
I
finally
went
to
bed
at
three
in
the
morning,
with
no
paper.
I
went
to
class
the
next
morning,
with
no
paper.
I
sat
through
the
entire
class
and
then
my
professor
miraculously
announced
that
he
would
not
be
collecting
our
papers;
we
could
turn
them
in
ourselves
to
the
W.
A.
if
we
wished.
I
of
course
counted
my
blessings
but
I
knew
that
next
time
I
may
not
be
so
lucky.
English
110
in
my
second
semester
was
similar
to
my
first
semester,
but
now
I
had
more
confidence.
I
could
have
been
exempt
from
the
class
because
I
did
well
my
first
semester
but
I
chose
not
to
be.
Although
I
felt
I
was
becoming
a
much
better
writer,
I
knew
I
could
still
improve.
I
wanted
to
reach
the
point
where
I
could
write
a
paper
within
a
day
with
the
least
amount
of
stress
as
possible.
My
class
once
again
focused
on
an
interesting
topic,
but
just
as
my
FYS
had
had
its
ups
and
downs,
so
did
this
class.
Just
as
I
had
my
first
mind
block
the
previous
semester,
it
was
time
for
my
first
all-nighter.
I
was
once
again
faced
with
the
possibility
of
not
being
able
to
finish
a
paper,
except
now
it
was
soon
to
be
a
reality.
Our
class
did
not
use
a
writing
associate
that
semester
so
all
drafts
were
due
to
the
professor,
on
time.
All
I
remember
are
the
hands
of
the
clock
going
around
from
one
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
through
practice,
through
work,
and
through
dinner.
It
seems
that
I
never
stopped
typing,
but
the
words
just
would
not
form
sentences
on
the
screen.
After
eight
cans
of
Mountain
Dew
and
two
Vivarin
I
finally
hit
the
print
button
at
5:50
A.M.,
just
in
time
to
shower
for
my
eight
o'clock
class.
Oddly,
it
did
not
seem
to
frustrate
me,
but
I
would
still
prefer
not
to
do
it
again.
Although
those
classes
taught
me
a
lot
about
college
writing,
there
is
still
one
class
that
has
taught
me
the
most
valuable
asset
yet.
That
class
is
Biology
laboratory
101.
Out
of
all
of
my
elementary,
high
school,
and
college
writing
experiences,
lab
has
taught
me
the
best
lesson
-
which
is
how
to
write
while
looking
at
a
blank
computer
screen.
Until
I
reached
college,
and
even
throughout
the
beginning
of
my
First
Year
Seminar,
I
had
always
written
all
of
my
papers
out
by
hand.
The
practice
started
out
of
necessity
since
my
family
did
not
own
a
computer
until
last
year.
I
would
always
write
my
papers
at
home
and
then
drive
to
a
friend's
house
in
order
to
type
them,
usually
the
night
before
they
were
due.
We
finally
bought
a
word
processor,
however
it
would
only
show
five
lines
of
text
at
a
time
and
I
needed
to
see
all
of
my
work
at
once.
When
I
got
to
college
however,
this
method
was
extremely
time
consuming
and
I
needed
to
be
as
efficient
as
possible.
Since
I
did
not
quite
consider
lab
a
structured
writing
class,
I
could
organize
the
thoughts
in
my
head
without
first
writing
them.
That,
to
me,
has
been
my
greatest
accomplishment
yet
even
if
it
does
only
affect
the
speed
of
my
task.
This
brings
me
to
the
conclusion
of
yet
another
paper.
But,
as
with
all
of
my
papers
thusfar,
I
seem
to
struggle
most
with
the
concluding
paragraph.
It
only
seems
fitting
to
leave
you
dangling;
however,
in
my
never-ending
efforts
to
become
a
better
writer,
I
will
try
to
summarize
my
thoughts.
Overall,
when
first
faced
with
the
task
of
tracing
my
history
as
a
writer,
I
felt
at
a
disadvantage
because
my
general
impression
has
always
been
that
I
hate
to
write.
However,
after
writing
down
all
of
my
experiences,
I
realized
that
I
actually
do
take
pleasure
in
writing.
Even
though
I
may
have
started
writing
at
a
late
age,
I
have
had
many
unique
opportunities
that
have
shaped
me
into
the
writer
I
am
today.
Along
my
journey,
I
somehow
also
discovered
I
could
assemble
a
grammatically
correct
sentence
on
a
topic
I
actually
enjoyed!
