A
Work
in
Progress
The
exchange
of
ideas
may
be
the
hallmark
of
the
human
race.
Nothing
is
more
effective
than
the
written
word
to
precisely
transmit
thoughts
and
concepts
from
one
person
to
another.
Writing,
when
done
properly,
can
capture
a
moment
and
freeze
it
for
countless
readers.
Humans
are
historical
creatures;
no
other
animal
is
both
trapped
and
freed
by
their
collective
past
in
quite
the
same
manner.
It
is
this
paradox
that
makes
writing
such
a
crucial
and
integral
part
of
our
culture.
Perhaps
that
is
why
most
children
are
encouraged
early
to
master
rudimentary
writing.
We,
as
humans,
cannot
function
without
it
and
I
am
no
exception.
My
first
writing
experience
I
can
recall
was
the
summer
before
I
started
nursery
school.
My
mom
worked
part-time
during
my
first
four
years
and
took
an
active
role
in
her
first
sons'
intellectual
development.
I
learned
how
to
read
by
my
fourth
birthday
and
my
appetite
was
insatiable.
The
gas
shortage
of
the
1970's
was
probably
extended
for
a
few
months
because
I
would
plead
with
my
mom
to
take
me
out
for
a
drive
in
our
1973
orange
Plymouth
Fury
so
I
could
read
street
signs
in
our
neighborhood.
After
our
afternoon
trips,
my
mom
and
I
would
sit
down
at
the
kitchen
table.
Struggling
in
the
big
chair
to
see
the
paper
on
the
table,
I
would
pick
out
a
crayon.
This
was
always
a
source
of
amusement
for
my
mom
because
the
five-minute
internal
struggle
always
ended
with
me
wielding
a
forest
green
Crayola.
At
first,
I
could
barely
write
some
of
the
simpler
names.
By
the
end
of
the
summer,
I
had
no
problem
mapping
out
the
route
we
took
that
particular
day
complete
with
some
running
narrative
such
as:
"fat
man
washing
car."
My
mom
took
care
not
to
let
my
dad
see
that
one.
I
was
in
nursery
school
for
one
year
and
it
was
an
exciting
time.
I
would
have
enjoyed
it
even
more
if
someone
had
alerted
me
to
the
fact
that
afternoon
naps
were
not
a
part
of
everyday
adult
life.
For
those
not
familiar
with
nursery
school,
the
curriculum
is
anything
but
demanding.
This
leaves
a
lot
of
free
time
with
friends
and
invariably
ends
with
some
form
of
mischief.
My
mom,
remembering
the
summer
fondly,
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
for
me
to
write
down
my
day's
activities
before
dinner
and
make
a
post-dinner
presentation.
Even
my
early
intellect
understood
that
I
could
not
tell
the
whole
story
complete
with
water
gun
battles
and
forced
quiet
time
for
my
fellow
rabble-rousers
and
me.
This
gave
birth
to
my
first
creative
writing
experience.
Imagine
the
shock
when
later
that
fall
during
a
teacher
conference,
my
family's
bubble
was
broken.
Needless
to
say,
my
early
fiction
work
was
not
my
parents'
favorite.
Thankfully
elementary
school
soon
followed
and
I
was
given
the
opportunity
to
put
my
boundless
energy
to
better
use.
A
friend
from
my
days
at
Slate
Belt
Nursery
School,
Jason
McFall,
had
followed
me
to
Wind
Gap
Elementary
and
our
friendship
flourished.
Jason
lived
close
and
soon
Friday
night
sleepovers
became
tradition.
Jason's
mom
was
an
English
teacher
and
an
owner
of
a
small,
local
newspaper.
She
was
convinced
that
Saturday
morning
cartoons
were
putrefying
the
collective
mind
of
America's
youth.
Her
solution
soon
followed.
Jason
would
be
dropped
off
at
the
Nazareth
Public
Library
for
two
hours
while
she
tended
to
business
at
her
newspaper
office.
I
was
told
that
misery
loves
company
and
before
long
I
was
included
on
the
weekly
field
trips
to
the
library.
Later
she
discovered
that
we
were
not
reading
the
classics
as
she
had
hoped
but
rather
we
were
using
our
library
time
to
read
Sports
Illustrated
and
find
hidden
pictures
in
Highlights
magazine.
Never
without
a
solution
to
a
problem,
Kathy
thought
it
would
be
a
fine
idea
for
us
to
write
small
reports
about
the
books
that
we
read.
We
hated
it,
but
like
most
things
in
life
the
value
of
an
experience
is
rarely
evident
at
that
time.
I
cannot
remember
a
single
book
that
I
read
or
a
report
that
I
wrote
in
that
library
over
those
years
but
the
writing
seed
was
planted.
High
school
tends
to
shake
up
an
adolescent's
priorities
and
I
was
no
exception.
My
focus
turned
from
Saturday
morning
book
reports
to
sports
and
girls.
Rebellion
takes
many
forms
and
my
manifested
itself
in
a
complete
disregard
for
schoolwork.
I
found
myself
at
9
am
writing
papers
that
were
due
at
noon.
With
my
solid
writing
foundation,
I
found
little
difficulty
in
achieving
my
singular
goal
in
high
school,
which
was
staying
academically
eligible
for
sports.
However,
in
my
senior
year
my
academics
were
spiraling
out
of
control.
I
had
managed
to
procrastinate
my
way
into
a
serious
jam;
I
had
less
than
four
days
to
write
a
fifteen
page
minimum
term
paper.
My
panic
was
mostly
caused
by
the
fact
that
I
had
yet
to
pick
a
topic.
I
decided
that
my
only
choice
was
to
write
about
something
so
obscure
and
technical
that
there
was
no
chance
that
an
English
teacher
would
be
able
to
follow
it.
I
chose
to
write
about
superconductors
and
their
applications
in
the
transportation
industry.
The
paper
was
loaded
with
jargon
and
official
sounding
terminology
that
had
little
to
no
bearing
on
the
superconductor
industry.
I
learned
two
valuable
lessons
with
that
paper.
First,
putting
writing
assignments
off
until
the
last
minute
is
a
terrible
idea.
I
have
never
read
a
medical
article
supporting
my
claim
but
I
am
sure
that
it
shaves
weeks
off
of
an
average
life
expectancy
due
to
stress.
Secondly,
a
writer
can
never
be
completely
sure
who
his
audience
is.
Unfortunately
the
paper
was
so
technical
sounding
that
an
intimidated
Ms.
Johnston
gave
it
to
her
father
for
help.
Dr.
Johnston,
a
mechanical
engineering
professor
at
a
college
in
New
York,
was
amused
by
my
feeble
attempt.
Ms.
Johnston
was
not.
Traditionally
the
last
week
of
school
is
senior
week,
which
is
filled
with
donkey
basketball
and
softball
toss
dunk
tanks.
Mine
was
spent
sweating
in
a
classroom
writing
a
second
term
paper
under
the
watchful
eye
of
Ms.
Johnston.
At
this
point
it
was
obvious
to
me
that
I
was
in
need
of
some
discipline.
It
was
not
until
3:30
in
the
morning
on
a
cold
March
morning
that
I
realized,
perhaps,
I
had
taken
it
a
step
too
far.
Basic
Training
is
not
a
summer
camp
or
a
quiet
place
for
reflection.
The
military
is
conducted
almost
entirely
in
verbs.
A
recruit
is
taught
how
to
do
everything
the
Navy
way
and
writing
is
no
exception.
Writing
concisely
is
the
primary
goal
in
military
writing;
the
fewer
words
there
are,
the
better.
Three
years
and
two
promotions
into
my
enlistment,
I
found
myself
with
twenty
men
under
my
supervision.
This
position
required
me
to
compose
reports
on
a
daily
basis.
I
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
attending
a
class
on
report
writing,
as
they
do
not
exist.
Instead
each
supervisor,
through
trial
and
error,
finds
out
what
works
and
stays
with
that.
My
direct
supervisor
was
a
busy
and
sometimes
obsessive
man
who
had
little
patience
for
long
or
inaccurate
reports.
I
was
told
to
never
use
two
words
when
one
word
would
work.
Building
on
this
advice,
I
adapted
my
writing
to
a
strictly
factual
style.
Additionally,
my
responsibilities
demanded
that
I
strenuously
researched
all
of
the
available
facts
before
I
would
submit
a
report.
Having
a
report
with
erroneous
information
handed
back
to
you
was
a
fate
worse
than
death
and
I
took
that
threat
seriously.
Most
of
the
daily
reports
that
I
drafted
dealt
with
flight
characteristics
of
aircraft
and
were
highly
technical
in
nature.
However,
my
report
writing
did
not
end
there.
A
less
desirable
function
of
a
military
supervisor
is
defending
his
troops.
There
is
not
a
lot
of
latitude
in
military
law
and
some
sailors
find
that
they
are
magnets
for
trouble.
A
supervisor
owes
it
to
his
men
to
exhaustively
research
alleged
charges
of
impropriety
against
his
workers.
Often
the
only
ally
that
a
sailor
could
count
on
would
be
his
supervisor
and
I
did
not
take
that
role
lightly.
I
was
once
told
that
the
military
preserves
democracy
but
it
does
not
have
to
practice
it.
Many
times,
the
more
aggressive
report
would
carry
the
day,
a
fact
that
I
learned
the
hard
way
as
a
greenhorn.
After
that
lesson,
I
learned
how
to
write
persuasive
reports
and
that
started
with
excellent
research.
The
research
serves
as
the
foundation
on
which
your
case
is
built.
Much
like
a
house,
if
the
foundation
is
shaky,
the
walls
will
fall
regardless
of
the
expertise
of
the
carpenter.
For
the
most
part,
collecting
all
of
the
facts
was
the
easy
part
of
preparing
the
report.
The
difference
between
a
winner
and
a
loser
came
down
to
the
organization
and
presentation
of
those
facts.
It
is
not
enough
to
know
that
your
subordinate
is
innocent;
you
have
to
prove
it
and
that
is
accomplished
in
the
actual
writing
of
the
report.
I
became
an
accomplished
military
writer
and
I
was
sought
out
by
other
supervisors
to
help
them
draft
difficult
defense
reports.
Undoubtedly,
those
research
and
report
writing
skills
have
paid
huge
dividends
at
Lafayette.
As
a
history
major
I
am
tasked
each
semester
to
choose
a
side
and
make
an
argument.
Contrary
to
popular
belief,
history
is
not
merely
an
accumulation
of
facts.
Facts,
in
and
of
themselves,
are
neutral.
However,
each
historian
brings
their
own
perspectives
and
prejudices
when
he
or
she
interprets
these
facts.
Sometimes
there
is
a
fine
line
between
historical
work
and
fiction
and
that
is
what
can
make
writing
history
difficult.
Occasionally
I
find
myself
trying
to
bend
the
facts
to
fit
into
my
predetermined
outcome.
After
all,
I
study
eighteenth
century
American
history;
all
of
the
men
that
I
write
about
would
find
it
difficult
to
defend
themselves.
However,
when
this
temptation
creeps
into
my
mind
and
onto
my
paper,
I
remind
myself
of
my
report
writing
days
in
the
navy.
In
those
reports,
both
sides
were
represented
and
capable
of
refuting
my
assertions.
I
try,
within
my
own
limitations,
to
fairly
evaluate
all
of
the
facts.
Armed
with
those
facts,
I
let
the
paper
go
in
its'
own
direction.
Many
times,
I
find
that
my
finished
product
bears
little
resemblance
to
my
original
thesis.
It
is
this
uncertainty
that
gives
rise
to
the
best,
and
sometimes,
the
worst
writing
experiences.
History
gives
a
unique
opportunity
to
learn
interesting
facets
of
human
life.
Every
person
and
event
in
the
span
of
human
existence
can
be,
after
close
examination,
learned
from.
History
has
allowed
me
to
examine
individuals
who
were
vilified
in
their
era
and
provide
a
different
perspective.
Specifically,
I
am
particularly
proud
of
my
work
regarding
Benedict
Arnold.
A
superficial
study
of
Arnold
will
yield
nothing
but
massive
character
flaws
and
treason.
However,
this
type
of
reaction
is
dangerous
because
it
does
not
examine
the
whole
person,
his
many
positive
contributions,
and
his
role
in
the
quest
for
American
independence.
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
researching
Arnold
because
it
allowed
me
to
appraise
both
his
positive
and
negative
qualities
in
the
context
of
eighteenth
century
America
and
help
to
dispel
myths
about
his
legacy.
I
have
found
that
extremely
rewarding.
Conversely,
my
writings
in
history
have
alerted
me
to
many
social
ills
that
I
was
previously
unaware
of.
For
example,
last
November
I
wrote
a
paper
on
free
speech
rights
in
the
military.
Initially,
I
sought
to
defend
the
military
because
I
felt
that
the
general
public
often
criticized
the
military
too
harshly.
My
thesis
was
centered
on
the
fact
that
soldiers
enjoyed
most
of
the
same
privileges
that
civilians
had.
However,
as
I
went
deeper
into
my
research
I
was
beginning
to
uncover
an
uncomfortable
truth.
Military
members,
especially
during
times
of
war,
lost
many
of
their
constitutionally
guaranteed
rights.
Specifically,
the
right
to
free
speech
was
severely
diminished
and
I
was
not
happy
with
my
findings.
I
seriously
considered
scrapping
the
paper,
eating
the
huge
amount
of
time
I
had
spent
on
research,
and
choosing
another
topic.
Ultimately
I
wrote
the
paper
and
I
was
pleased
with
the
way
it
turned
out.
What
had
initially
started
as
my
worst
experience
as
a
writer
transformed
into
my
best.
Humans
rely
on
writing
more
than
almost
any
other
aspect
of
life.
Try
to
imagine
your
life
without
it.
Although
I
did
not
write
on
cave
walls,
I
am
older
than
the
average
Lafayette
student
and
thus
have
more
writing
experiences
upon
which
to
draw.
More
importantly,
I
believe
that
life
experience
influences
the
type
of
writer
that
we
will
ultimately
become.
Much
like
writing
a
paper
where
the
conclusion
is
uncertain,
so
are
we
as
writers.
Interests,
addresses,
and
friends
all
change
over
the
course
of
time
and
this
profoundly
shapes
our
writing
style.
We,
as
writers,
are
all
works
in
progress
and
I
think
it
is
helpful
to
always
keep
that
in
mind.
