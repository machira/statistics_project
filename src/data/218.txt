WA
Writing
Assignment

Waves
lapped
against
the
sand
in
a
constant
pattern
as
I
stood
on
the
shore
day
after
day
during
those
youthful
summers.
Chasing
the
wake
up
and
down
the
beach
hour
after
hour,
I
would
tell
my
stories
to
the
sea
and
let
my
imagination
wander
as
I
scampered
among
the
broken
seashells.
As
a
young
child
this
was
my
earliest
form
of
brainstorming
and
creative
expression,
and
many
of
the
ideas
I
conjured
up
on
that
salty
beach
later
became
the
basis
of
much
of
my
creative
writing.
From
research
papers
to
poetry
and
prose,
my
experience
as
a
writer
has
been
affected
over
the
years
by
the
influences
of
brilliant
teachers,
my
own
life
experiences,
and
my
observations
of
others
in
our
world.
Certainly,
I
have
come
to
realize
that
my
literary
history
has
been
one
of
freedom
and
conformity
going
hand
in
hand
at
times.
Throughout
my
elementary
school
years,
my
imagination
was
usually
free
to
take
charge
of
my
writing.
In
second
grade
we
began
experimenting
with
other
types
of
poetry
such
as
haikus
and
limericks.
Mrs.
Drauschak,
our
second
grade
teacher,
usually
gave
us
freedom
in
these
types
of
writings,
and
many
times
the
class
shared
chuckles
over
one
another's
crazy
stories
about
a
"little
old
man
from
Nantucket..."
However,
most
of
elementary
school
was
also
full
of
writing
paragraphs
about
our
families,
about
the
seasons
of
the
year,
or
about
our
favorite
foods,
activities,
or
TV
shows.
Although
I
enjoyed
the
writing,
I
always
cringed
when
our
teacher
would
begin
to
pass
out
the
yellow
scrap
paper.
This
yellow
scrap
paper
followed
me
even
to
J)jgh
school,
but
in
elementary
school
I
found
it
even
harder
to
deal
with
considering
the
fact
that
our
pencils
were
so
thick
and
the
lead
was
so
light
on
the
paper.
The
texture
of
the
yellow
scrap
paper
practically
forbad
eraser
marks,
and
if
an
eraser
was
attempted,
it
would
no
doubt
leave
a
dime-sized
hole
in
my
stories.
Opposed
to
the
yellow
scrap
paper,
however,
was
the
clean,
white
composition
paper
that
was
awarded
to
us
after
our
work
was
revised,
edited,
and
approved
by
our
teachers.
Using
a
pen
or
a
nicely
sharpened
pencil
on
this
paper
was
always
a
treat,
and
my
words
could
be
written
so
smooth
and
bold
in
contrast
to
the
obstacle
of
the
yellow
scrap
paper.
Mrs.
St.
Angelo's
third
and
fourth
grade
classes
introduced
me
to
the
genre
which
was
the
research
paper.
My
first
research
paper
ever
written
was
on
the
Milky
Way
Galaxy,
and
although
the
research
was
tedious
at
times,
I
learned
to
understand
the
conformity
and
process
that
comes
along
with
writing
any
kind
of
research
paper,
and
it
was
easy
to
get
used
to.
Fourth
grade
was
my
first
run-in
with
notecards,
and
little
did
I
know
that
these
notecards
would
be
a
staple
of
every
research
paper
I
was
to
write
all
the
way
through
high
school.
Throughout
elementary
school
and
for
years
to
follow,
my
family
members
were
always
interested
in
my
writing.
My
mother
would
help
proofread
and
offer
comments,
and
my
family
was
always
supportive
of
my
creative
writing,
which
made
writing
more
comfortable
for
me.
Mr.
Vermuth's
fifth
grade
class
was
a
turning
point
in
my
writing
history.
It
was
this
year
that
we
were
expected
to
write
our
first
creative
short
story
which
had
to
be
of
significant
length.
The
entire
class
was
given
complete
freedom
on
what
and
how
we
chose
to
write.
I
had
been
waiting
for
this,
and
although
I
rolled
my
eyes
as
Mr.
Vermuth
handed
out
stacks
of
yellow
scrap
paper,
I
was
ready
to
get
started.
My
excitement
was
obvious
as
I
went
through
page
after
page
of
scrap
paper.
I
molded
a
story
of
a
young
girl
about
my
age
living
far
into
the
future
dealing
with
ironic
situations
and
obstacles
in
her
own
life
in
a
quest
to
solve
a
mystery
of
a
lost
item
in
a
world
similar
to
the
setting
of
the
Jetson's.
In
later
years
I
noticed
how
this
was
the
start
of
using
the
point
of
view
of
a
child
in
my
writing.
Even
in
later
years,
I
found
myself
often
writing
in
the
mindset
of
a
child.
This
was
not
because
my
writing
was
simple
or
elementary,
but
rather
because
I
enjoyed
writing
about
experiences
from
the
stance
of
children's
innocence
and
feelings
in
a
world
that
does
not
always
understand
them,
and
many
times
underestimates
them.
I
found
middle
school
to
bring
a
lot
of
facts
and
research
in
my
writing
and
less
creative
expression.
This
was
approximately
the
time
I
began
my
first
private
journal,
which
I
kept
through
my
entire
middle
school
career.
I
kept
the
journal
hidden
at
the
bottom
of
a
drawer
in
my
desk,
and
I
would
randomly
take
it
out
to
log
recent
activities,
happenings,
and
feelings
that
were
going
on
with
my
family,
friends,
and
myself.
I
found
myself
using
my
writing
to
vent
frustrations
on
various
subjects
or
people,
and
also
to
document
my
excitement
as
I
grew
up
through
the
treacherous
years
of
middle
school.
Middle
school
English
classes
focused
on
a
lot
of
grammar,
method,
and
conformity
in
writing.
We
experimented
a
little
more
with
poetry,
but
any
creative
writing
in
middle
school
came
from
my
enrichment
classes,
in
which
we
wrote
often
on
the
different
books
we
were
reading
at
the
time
and
our
reactions
to
certain
writers,
people,
or
issues.
At
this
point,
most
of
my
assignments
were
still
being
handwritten
with
pencil
or,
preferably,
with
pen.
Word
processing
had
not
yet
exploded
into
the
popularity
it
holds
today,
so
even
if
I
was
expected
to
type
an
essay
or
paper,
I
always
had
to
write
it
out
first
on
paper
before
going
to
the
computer.
I
kept
excellent
grades
in
my
English
and
reading
classes
through
middle
school,
and
many
teachers
praised
my
writing
style.
However,
it
was
not
until
high
school
that
I
met
and
worked
with
teachers
who
challenged
me,
motivated
my
writing,
and
inspired
me
to
think
critically
and
scholarly
about
the
world
around
me
and
how
to
reflect
those
feelings
and
thoughts
in
my
assignments.
My
freshmen
class
in
high
school
was
the
last
class
lucky
enough
to
have
Mr.
Ulrich
as
an
English
teacher.
Ulrich
prepared
us
for
what
was
later
to
come
as
upperclassmen,
and
his
influence
on
my
education
was
profound
as
he
promoted
a
freewriting,
thought
provoking
style
in
our
literary
expression.
He
introduced
weekly
journals
and
instructed
us
to
comment
on
four
topics.
Three
of
the
topics
were
given
to
us
either
as
questions
about
ourselves,
our
dreams,
our
goals,
our
relationships
with
others,
or
we
were
asked
to
comment
on
certain
quotes
or
current
issues.
The
fourth
topic
was
always
our
own
choice,
which
left
much
to
creativity.
I
remember
writing
on
my
family
members,
my
friendships,
my
views
of
the
world
politically,
emotionally,
or
socially,
and
Mr.
Ulrich
would
read
these
responses
with
an
open
mind,
offering
comments
here
and
there,
either
thought
provoking
comments
asking
us
to
further
explore
the
topic
or
gracious
praise
for
putting
such
scholarly
thought
into
the
assignment.
Otherwise,
the
first
two
years
of
high
school
asked
us
to
produce
more
book
and
article
reviews,
historical
research
papers,
literary
narratives,
and
informative
speeches.
Junior
year
definitely
held
the
most
influence
on
my
literary
history.
Advanced
Placement
courses
began
that
year,
and
between
writing
for
my
American
History
and
English
classes,
I
certainly
experienced
the
two
sides
of
conformity
and
freedom
in
my
writing.
I
see
both
sides
equally
important
now
in
my
college
writing
career,
and
these
two
junior
year
classes
laid
the
groundwork
for
that
balance.
My
renowned
American
History
teacher
made
historical
essay
writing
a
step-by-step
process
where
there
was
definitely
a
right
and
a
wrong
way
to
do
things.
We
were
taught
to
begin
paragraphs
in
a
standardized
way,
organize
our
facts,
incorporate
examples,
and
support
a
solid
thesis
statement.
I
learned
that
once
I
caught
the
hang
of
writing
this
way,
the
course
was
a
breeze,
and
as
long
as
I
knew
the
facts,
the
weekly
in-class
essay
writing
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of.
Though
my
history
teacher
left
little
to
creative
expression,
his
course
was
essential
in
preparing
me
for
college
essay
writing
in
ways
of
structure,
clarity,
and
organization,
and
as
the
year
progressed
I
could
tell
that
my
writing
was
improving
overall.
On
the
other
side
of
this
writing
balance
was
my
English
class
taught
by
Ms.
Welsh,
who
turned
out
to
be
the
most
inspiring
teacher
I
had
ever
had.
Not
only
that,
but
she
was
also
the
most
demanding
high
school
teacher
I
had
ever
been
in
class
with.
Ms.
Welsh
demanded
many
readings
and
short
essay
responses
in
class,
and
as
we
learned
for
the
first
time
the
real
definitions
of
words
like
juxtaposition
and
ambiance,
our
frustrations
about
the
class
were
pushing
us
to
work
harder
and
produce
more
focused
and
intelligent
papers
as
the
year
progressed.
In
my
writing
history,
my
main
problem
had
been
a
problem
of
focus
and
sticking
to
a
well-designed
thesis
statement.
Junior
year
English
strengthened
this
area
greatly
as
we
wrote
more
and
more
responses
to
literature
and
experimented
with
more
persuasive
writing.
My
first
few
papers
in
her
class
were
ripped
to
shreds
with
red
ink
and
comments
about
focus,
thesis,
and
organization.
I
had
the
tendency
to
start
writing
on
a
subject,
and
with
so
much
to
say,
I
was
not
always
sure
how
to
incorporate
all
of
my
thoughts
and
conclusions
into
a
clear,
flowing
creative
essay.
Ms.
Welsh
helped
me
build
that
thesis-forming
ability
and
apply
more
focus
in
my
writing.
By
the
end
of
the
year
I
was
receiving
praise
from
Ms.
Welsh
that
made
me
feel
confident
and
satisfied
as
a
writer,
for
I
knew
for
a
fact
that
she
did
not
give
out
praise
unless
it
was
rightfully
due.
Another
reason
as
to
why
this
class
was
so
influential
in
preparing
me
for
a
liberal
arts
education
in
college,
was
that
Ms.
Welsh's
class
was
the
first
class
to
require
a
lengthy
portfolio
of
our
best,
revised
works
at
the
end
of
the
year
including
poetry,
research
papers,
book
criticisms,
essays,
creative
writings,
and
even
drama
pieces
we
performed.
However,
our
portfolios
were
not
just
a
collection
of
our
works.
It
was
quite
a
job
going
back
through
a
year's
worth
of
writing
and
revising,
editing,
improving,
and
reflecting
upon
the
work
to
make
it
the
best
it
could
be.
Reflection
was
a
large
part
of
our
final
portfolios,
and
we
were
instructed
to
go
back,
and
after
the
corrections
and
revisions
were
made
we
wrote
reflections
on
each
piece
of
work
that
was
included
in
the
portfolio.
It
was
the
first
time
I
really
went
through
my
writing
to
think
about
how
each
piece
made
me
feel,
what
was
challenging
about
each
assignment,
why
I
wrote
on
the
subjects
I
chose,
and
what
my
emotions
were
when
the
work
was
finally
completed.
Learning
and
getting
accustomed
to
treating
my
assignments
in
this
reflecting
way
has
stayed
with
me
into
college,
and
the
English
class
as
a
whole
helped
me
trudge
successfully
through
my
first
year
seminar
at
Lafayette
two
years
later,
when
the
teacher
was
even
more
demanding
and
the
assignments
required
even
more
focus
and
reflection.
With
college
decisions
pending,
senior
year
was
a
blur
of
writing
and
revising
essays
and
preparing
for
interviews.
I
felt
confident
going
into
my
college
interviews
with
my
portfolio
under
my
arm,
prepared
to
show
the
admissions
officer
samples
of
my
writing
and
a
look
into
the
quality
of
work
I
was
able
to
produce.
Shortly
before
graduation
I
faced
one
of
the
largest
challenges
in
my
writing
history
when
it
was
time
to
write
my
graduation
speech.
I
suffered
through
writer's
block
for
days,
unable
to
construct
any
clear
idea
of
what
I
wanted
to
say
to
my
fellow
classmates.
Graduation
loomed
just
five
short
days
away
and
still
my
pages
were
blank.
However,
I
made
myself
sit
down
in
front
of
my
intimidating
word
processor
and
forced
myself
to
write.
Surprisingly
I
finished
a
draft
just
a
few
hours
later,
but
although
I
was
relieved
to
have
made
progress,
I
knew
this
draft
was
not
exactly
what
I
had
hoped
for.
My
doubts
were
proven
when
I
gave
the
draft
to
my
parents
to
look
over.
Minutes
later
my
stepfather
came
back
to
me
with
the
paper
in
hand,
which
was
scribbled
on
all
over,
and
questioned
me,
"Alison,
what
is
it
you
are
trying
to
say?"
He
was
right.
In
my
nervous
state,
my
problems
of
focus
and
clarity
in
my
writing
were
evident.
I
knew
the
speech
was
just
sitting
there
in
my
head,
but
I
was
unable
to
grasp
it.
I
took
a
day
off,
frustrated,
and
the
next
afternoon,
without
even
planning
on
it,
I
came
home,
immediately
sat
down
in
front
of
the
computer,
and
let
my
ideas
pour
out
through
my
fingertips.
I
was
finally
relaxed,
and
when
the
speech
was
complete,
I
was
truly
satisfied.
My
stepfather
agreed
that
my
new
version
was
clear,
concise,
and
meaningful,
and
the
next
day
I
brought
the
draft
to
the
first
rehearsal,
where
our
teacher
was
deeply
content
with
our
efforts,
and
the
speech
was
a
hit
on
graduation
day.
I
honestly
did
not
know
what
to
expect
on
the
first
day
of
my
first
year
seminar
class
at
Lafayette.
My
first
impressions
were
of
a
demanding,
brilliant
teacher
who
would
expect
the
best
in
our
writing
and
our
preparation,
and
I
hoped
that
I
would
be
able
to
work
up
to
her
standards.
First
year
seminar
was
an
intense
four
months
of
heavy
reading,
constant
writing,
peer-editing
sessions,
creative
projects,
and
a
final
paper
incorporating
various
writing
samples
gathered
throughout
the
course.
I
was
introduced
to
posting
our
comments
and
assignments
on
a
website,
and
I
was
soon
used
to
this
method.
It
was
a
class
that
was
always
on
my
mind,
and
although
the
demands
could
be
extremely
frustrating
at
times,
not
only
could
I
see
my
own
writing
improving
in
the
sense
of
clarity
and
ideas,
but
I
watched
the
work
of
my
fellow
classmates
improve
also.
My
professor
agreed
with
me
that
my
papers
were
improving
each
time.
By
the
time
our
last
assignment
was
due,
I
was
able
to
construct
a
focused
thesis,
which
I
supported
through
the
paper,
and
I
cannot
remember
ever
being
more
proud
of
a
paper
in
my
entire
literary
career.
I
am
aware
that
I
have
quite
a
long
way
to
go
and
much
to
learn
still
concerning
the
science
of
writing.
I
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
learn
from
numerous
supportive
teachers,
family
members,
and
friends,
and
I
have
exposed
myself
to
as
much
literature
and
writing
as
possible.
I
have
loved
exploring
creative
expression
ever
since
I
was
a
young
child
using
my
imagination
to
come
up
with
stories
at
the
beach.
My
education,
which
I
believe
adequately
prepared
me
for
the
expectations
of
college
writing,
has
taught
me
to
appreciate
both
the
conformity
and
the
freedom
which
is
possible
in
literary
expression.
My
literary
history
is
still
being
written,
and
I
expect
this
year
as
a
WA
and
continuing
in
my
liberal
arts
education
at
Lafayette,
that
my
writing
will
improve
more,
and
my
writing
style
will
develop
into
a
style
that
truly
fits
who
I
am.
