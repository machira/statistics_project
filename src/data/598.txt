a

and
a
2E
To
be
a
WA.
Pronounced
with
bondacity
and
that
upper-Englishy
accent
only
an
Oxford
gent
or
the
BBC
Evening
News
Guy
can
really
pull
off,
it
only
sounds
a
tad
less
elitist
than
it
actually
is.
Try
it
again,
To
BeEa
WA.
Ahh,
just
warms
your
cockles,
eh?
Knowing
youOve
made
it?
Crossing
that
finish
line?
Topping
that
mountain?
Why,
all
those
members
of
the
opposite
sexOll
be
clamoring
for
you
now,
and
with
that
grossly
inflated
stipend
you
might
as
well
retire,
or
go
skiing,
or
blow
it
all
on
a
candy
bar.
Orrrr,
you
can
look
forward
to
a
semester
of
thinking
as
though
youOre
a
40
year
old
English
literature
MA
with
nothing
better
to
do
than
exercising
your
penchant
for
OHigher
Order
Concerns!O,
a
contempt
both
for
free
time
and
sleep,
and
a
deep
seated
need
to
insure
everyone
Nfeels
okeydokey
now,
yes?O
about
the
ever-constructive,
never-prescriptive,
beneficently-votive
feedback
youOve
just
doled
out.
This
while
genuinely
caring
whether
or
not
the
thirteenth
Freshman
Engineering
Major
who
hates-your-guts-and-doesnOt-want-to-be-there
youOve
seen
today
can
travel
argumentatively
from
A
to
B
and
maybe
even
C
while
congealing
from
his/her/its
severely
disinterested
brain
something
resembling
a
thesis.
Mixed
with
a
gob-hill
of
paperwork,
weekly
staff
meetings
that
would
make
Beelzebub
pine
for
home
(cause
theyOre
heavenly,
yes?
alright),
and
a
workload
more
sporadic,
schizophrenic,
and
overbearing
than
the
most
devoted
German
IV
professor
youOve
ever
had,
and
youOve
got
something
akin
to
being
a
WA,
or
so
IOve
heard.
Top
oO
the
mountain
still
look
all
jimmeny
bright,
yes?
Wonderful
of
you
to
sign
on,
from
here
itOs
a
joyous
and
jumpy
escalator
ride
on
the
St.
MartinOs
expressway
of
extracurricular
commitment
to
D
no
not
NDa-HoodO,
close
though
D
WA-hood.
That
devilishly
well
crafted
introduction
is
certainly
not
to
say
your
experience,
Oh
Unsuspecting,
Unassuming
One,
will
be
unfulfilling,
uninspiring,
unmotivational,
non-developmental,
or
overall
a
rather
poor
way
to
spend
your
time
D
quite
the
contrary.
Indeed
WA
work
will
most
likely
prove
inspiring,
motivating,
fulfilling,
personally
developmenting,
and
generally
speaking
gerunds
well
spent.
Still,
thatOs
certainly
not
to
say
itOs
an
experience
that
will
leave
you
with
as
few
gray
hairs
as
you
started
with.
Then
again,
considering
in
some
cultures
gray
hair
signifies
age,
wisdom,
and
just
the
kind
of
intellectual
maturity
you
hoped
to
get
from
your
WA-ship,
this
may
be
saying
that
itOs
a
win-win
all
around,
but
whoOs
to
say.
Instead,
to
kick
off
this
didactic
journey
of
self-reflection,
IOd
like
to
talk
about
our
feelings.
Is
that
alright?
Good.
Well,
I
feel
wonderful.
ItOs
week
four
of
my
first
year
as
a
NWriting
AssociateO,
which
in
my
enthusiasm
IOve
just
had
tattooed
provocatively
somewhere
provocative,
and
I
feel
like
a
million
bucks,
well
oddly
closer
to
eight
hundred
but
whoOs
counting.
ItOs
been
sweet
sailing
so
far,
snacks
at
the
staff
meeting,
no
papers,
still
no
contact
from
my
professor,
so
life
is
no
worries.
Then
BAM!!
SEVENTEEN
SIX-PAGE
STUDENT
PAPERS
SPLIT
ACROSS
MY
IN-BOX,
CAMPUS
BOX,
AND
SHOE
BOX
ALL
CONFERENCING
IN
A
SPAN
OF
SIX
DAYS
WHOSE
AUTHORS
IOVE
NEVER
MET
TOPPED
OFF
WITH
THREE
HOURS
OF
DROP-IN!!!
Am
I
still
feeling
great?
BLOODY
WELL
NOT!!
And
whoOs
fault
is
that?
WELL,
ITOS!!Emine.
Hmm,
curious.
Had
I
contacted
my
professor
up
front,
as
soon
as
super-humanly
possible,
even
after
the
e-mails
went
unnoticed,
the
phone
calls
didnOt
work,
the
care
package
to
his
home
failed
to
return
a
thank
you
card,
and
all
other
options
were
exhausted
besides
actually
going
to
his
office,
which
IOd
never
tried,
maybe
A)
I
could
have
set
down
ground
rules
for
how
papers
should
be
collected,
B)
I
could
have
met
the
class
before
conferencing
with
them,
C)
I
could
have
had
the
dates
for
the
first
round,
ergo
scheduled
my
drop-in
hours
another
time,
and
D)
I
could
have
slept
this
week.
Gosh
IOm
a
silly
goose.
After
reflecting,
as
asked,
on
both
this
spirit
of
goosiness,
and
on
my
year
as
a
WA,
I
have
but
a
few
corollaries
to
the
pearls
above,
three
of
which
are
true,
one
of
which
is
really
true,
and
none
of
which
need
apply.
First:
get
to
know
your
assigned
Professor.
Bribery
is
a
good
option;
most
professors
claim
to
be
hungry
for
the
attainment
and
proliferation
of
knowledge,
which
probably
just
means
hungry
for
a
break
to
do
research,
which
most
likely
just
means
hungry
for
a
pension,
which
actually
just
means
hungry.
So
I
often
opt
for
Nacho
Cheese
DoritosS,
though
IOve
seen
WendyOs
and
Mixed
Salted
Party
Nuts
applied
with
impressive
results
as
well.
Also
rumored
to
work
is
candid,
early-semester
conversation
about
your
role
as
a
WA,
the
establishment
of
clear
guidelines,
deadlines,
and
communication
lines,
and
a
friendly
and
helpful
demeanor,
though
these
havenOt
been
thoroughly
tested.
Second:
take
all
necessary
precautions
to
avoid
your
WA-ees
outside
of
WA
conference
time.
Encountering
Jimmy
the
Freshman,
who
just
received
a
70
on
the
paper
you
thought
so
thoroughly
well-picked-apart
by
yours
truly,
may
not
behave
quite
as
civilly
at
the
Tri
Delta
party
Thursday
night
as
you
would
have
hoped,
while
Janey
the
Freshman,
whoOs
paper
you
glowed
over
for
30
minutes,
might
have
(though
NhopefullyO
not)
received
a
few
crucially
mixed
signals
which
blossom
only
after
her
first
power
hour.
You
could,
as
an
alternative,
strive
for
a
balance
between
criticism
and
praise
that
would
leave
your
WA-ee
with
a
pleasant
sensation,
of
knowing
what
needs
to
be
done
while
feeling
good
about
what
has
been
achieved,
kind
of
like
spearmint.
Third:
get
to
know
your
WA-ees
as
well
as
you
can.
ThereOs
nothing
quite
like
the
second
conference
opening
line
Nso
how
transpired
your
Soccer
match
of
Saturday
past
Elizabeth?
Win
one
for
old
U,
wot
wot?O
ThereOs
also
nothing
quite
like
that
third
conference
conversation
that
goes
like
this;
WA:
NI
really
enjoyed
learning
about
Japanese
culture
from
your
personal
narrative
Chin-Mae.O
Chin-Mae:
NIOm
Korean.O
ThaaatOs
a
winner.
Be
personable;
get
to
know
your
WA-ees
well.
Fourth:
if
peer-reviewing
(not
editing
for
heavenOs
sake,
watch
your
language),
isnOt
something
you
truly
enjoy,
or
use
to
fuel
your
rather
over-inflated
ego,
or
find
yourself
doing
off-hand
for
desperate
friends
at
3am
already
anyway,
then
I
canOt
say
WA-ing
will
be
your
particular
bowl
of
peaches
and
cream,
though
you
may
find
yourself
reading
papers
that
sound
awfully
like
the
lyrics
to
NPeaches
and
CreamO,
which
may
in
fact
be
your
bowl
of
peaches
and
cream,
so
who
knows.
Still,
for
you
who
have
yet
to
embark
on
the
wonderfully
awkward
adventure
of
Nreading
writing
written
by
writers
close
to
your
age
who
youOll
likely
spend
the
next
few
years
withO,
you
can
at
least
stand
firmly
on
a
few
things.
Have
faith
that
no-one
youOll
meet
and
nothing
youOll
learn
during
the
training
session
will
help
quite
as
much
as
you
might
have
hoped,
and
that
your
epic
FIRST
CONFERENCE
will
be
one
big
mental
hiccup
through
NDrat
I
forgot
his
name,
Drat
thatOs
Lower
Order,
Drat
which
oneOs
Lower
Order,
Drat
IOm
talking
too
much,
Drat
thereOs
25
minutes
left
and
IOve
nothing
to
say,
Drat
I
forgot
his
name
again.O
Sleep
soundly
knowing
your
assigned
professor
will
probably
think
E-mail
is
a
gender
and
a
due
date
is
something
only
his
expecting
wife
should
really
have
to
deal
with,
so
why
are
you
bothering
him
about
it.
Feel
a
warm
fuzzy
feeling
that
your
drop-in
hours
will
seem
to
accumulate
via
a
system
of
mathematics
less
akin
to
addition
than
to
the
vortexed
bottom
of
MerlinOs
hat,
a
process
as
yet
unfathomable
even
to
the
most
devoted
and
deranged
of
WAs.
Further,
throughout
your
seemingly
endless
search
(and
indeed
it
will
prove
endless)
for
the
ultimately
open-ended
question
and
for
that
student
whose
face
you
still
havenOt
seen
come
Final
Exams,
remember
that
misery
dearly
loves
D
and
so
easily
finds
D
plenty
of
company,
WA-ees
are
people
too
(though
the
voteOs
still
out
on
WAs
themselves),
and
if
you
truly
are
the
Chosen
One,
who
can
fully
and
without
qualm
HOC
LOC
and
Drop
It
on
the
roof
of
Pardee
Hall
wearing
nothing
but
the
Grand
Ole
Lafayette
Flag
youOll
win
not
only
WAbbles,
the
thanksgiving
turkey
hidden
somewhere
in
McKeen,
but
the
title
of
Super-WA
O08-O09
and
secure
a
special
place
in
the
hearts
and
minds
of
the
WA
program,
and
in
the
backseat
of
a
public
safety
car.
So
as
you
read
this
sparkling
specimen
of
a
literacy
narrative,
no
doubt
exercising
those
freshly
honed
reviewing
skills
of
yours,
feel
free
to
use
the
preponderance
of
run-ons,
over-hyphe-nation,
gender
ambivalence,
poor
flow,
lack
of
direction,
paucity
of
thesi
(plural
of
thesis,
durh),
and
just
plain
overall
junkiness
(hey
thatOs
HIGHER
order,
nice)
of
the
preceding
paragraphs
to
isolate
what
precisely
NOT
to
include
in
your
own
writing,
or
to
let
slip
by
un-circled
a
hundred
times
in
bright
red
double-thick
Sharpee
over
the
coming
weeks
D
because,
True
of
False,
we
like
our
student
papers
positively
dripping
with
corrective
ink.
For
what
itOs
worth,
I
do
hope
IOve
smoothed
a
few
of
those
jitters
you
must
be
feeling,
reassured
you
of
the
ease,
grace,
and
pleasant
proficiency
with
which
we
do
things
here
in
WA-land,
and
paved
your
way
to
regions
of
ebullient
literary
ability
you
never
knew
you
had
in
you,
and
now
would
rather
have
left
alone.
Please
take
away
as
many
life
lessons
as
you
can,
take
as
few
WA
tactics
as
possible,
take
a
bow
from
the
roof
of
Pardee,
and
take
this
job
seriously
for
heavenOs
sake,
what
do
you
think
theyOre
paying
you
for.
