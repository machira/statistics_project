WA
Literacy
Narrative
August
15,
2008
During
the
past
year,
I
have
gained
a
great
deal
of
experience
as
a
WA
and
as
a
writer.
I
have
discovered
ways
to
approach
writing
that
are
different
from
those
to
which
I
had
previously
been
accustomed,
and
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
write
in
a
variety
of
styles.
One
experience
that
especially
stands
out
in
my
mind
as
formative,
difficult,
and
rewarding
all
at
the
same
time
is
the
work
I
did
my
first
semester
as
a
WA.
I
was
assigned
to
a
two
hundred
level
English
course,
and
I
initially
felt
very
confident
in
my
abilities
to
be
successful
as
a
WA
for
this
course.
I
had
taken
this
course
myself
the
year
before
and
done
fairly
well
in
it.
I
assumed
that
there
would
be
some
challenges
involved
in
working
as
a
WA,
but
I
did
not
anticipate
the
amount
of
stress
that
would
be
involved
with
this
assignment.
I
contacted
the
professor
and
arranged
a
day
to
come
and
meet
with
the
class.
When
I
showed
up
the
professor
asked
me
to
explain
to
the
class
exactly
how
I
would
be
interacting
with
them
in
my
role
as
a
WA.
I
described
to
them
how
the
WA
program
operates
and
provided
them
with
some
details
about
how
conferences
worked.
They
were
all
upperclassmen
and
had
worked
with
the
WA
program
before
so
I
thought
that
my
explanation
was
sufficient.
However,
when
I
finished
talking
the
professor
turned
to
me
with
a
dissatisfied
expression
on
his
face
and
asked,
NIs
that
it?O
A
little
flustered,
I
replied
that
it
was.
I
felt
embarrassed
and
inadequately
prepared,
but
I
learned
a
valuable
lesson.
Now
I
make
it
a
point
to
ask
the
professors
I
work
with
if
there
are
any
specific
aspects
of
the
WA
program
they
wish
me
to
discuss
with
the
class.
Each
professor
has
his
or
her
own
expectations
of
a
WA,
and
I
have
learned
that
it
is
important
to
make
sure
that
we
are
on
the
same
page
in
order
to
avoid
awkward
situations.
My
experiences
during
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
also
helped
me
to
understand
how
important
it
was
to
have
the
support
and
encouragement
of
fellow
WAs
when
things
get
stressful.
After
my
first
round
of
conferences,
the
professor
I
was
working
with
asked
to
meet
with
me.
He
had
received
the
final
drafts
of
these
papers
and
graded
them,
but
he
wanted
me
to
explain
what
I
had
talked
about
with
the
students
during
our
conferences.
He
was
especially
interested
in
what
I
had
thought
of
the
papers
he
assigned
the
lowest
grades
to,
and
he
explained
to
me
why
he
had
given
these
papers
low
grades.
At
first,
I
thought
this
meant
that
he
doubted
my
abilities
as
a
WA.
However,
another
WA
who
was
working
with
another
one
of
this
professorOs
classes
assured
me
that
the
same
thing
had
happened
to
him.
He
explained
that
it
was
simply
the
professorOs
way
of
assuring
that
the
WAs
were
focusing
on
higher
order
concerns
during
conferences.
In
addition
to
teaching
me
about
working
with
professors
and
fellow
WAs,
my
first
round
assignment
as
a
WA
also
taught
me
a
good
deal
about
working
with
students.
All
of
the
students
showed
up
on
time
and
most
of
them
were
reasonably
receptive
to
having
a
conversation
with
me
about
their
papers.
The
main
problem
I
encountered
was
that
students
expected
me
to
have
a
special
insight
into
the
course
and
the
professor
since
I
had
also
taken
that
course
with
him.
I
was
careful
to
make
it
clear
to
the
students
that
just
because
I
had
taken
the
class
did
not
mean
I
could
predict
how
their
papers
would
be
graded.
I
had
expected
my
previous
experience
with
this
course
and
professor
to
be
helpful
to
me
as
a
WA.
However,
what
I
found
out
was
that
this
raised
studentsO
expectations
of
me.
It
also
sometimes
made
it
more
difficult
for
me
to
be
an
objective
reader
of
the
studentsO
papers.
I
had
to
remind
myself
to
focus
on
how
each
student
had
approached
the
assignments,
not
on
how
I
had
approached
the
same
assignments
when
I
took
the
class.
I
think
that
I
did
this
successfully,
but
this
experience
helped
me
to
realize
the
importance
of
reading
studentsO
papers
from
an
objective
perspective.
The
most
difficult
experience
I
had
with
a
student
during
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
previous
experiences
with
this
course.
It
had
to
do
with
a
student
who
seemed
to
think
that
meeting
with
me
was
a
waste
of
his
time.
He
was
a
senior
English
major
and
a
good
writer.
He
would
show
up
for
his
conferences
on
time,
and
he
was
always
polite.
He
was
also
completely
unresponsive
when
I
tried
to
discuss
his
papers
with
him.
He
would
let
me
know
that
he
already
thought
his
work
was
good
enough
and
that
he
could
handle
any
improvements
on
his
own.
At
first,
I
felt
frustrated
by
this,
and
then
I
tried
to
approach
our
conferences
by
asking
the
student
more
general
questions
about
his
writing
process
rather
than
about
any
particular
paper.
Unfortunately,
he
still
did
not
really
respond.
This
experience
taught
me
that
sometimes
N
despite
a
WAs
best
efforts
N
a
student
will
remain
uncooperative.
This
was
a
lesson
that
I
kept
in
mind
the
next
semester
when
one
student
did
not
show
up
for
any
of
his
conferences.
He
would
sign
up
for
a
conference
slot,
but
he
would
never
come.
He
also
ignored
the
numerous
e-mails
I
sent
him
asking
to
reschedule.
After
trying
to
handle
this
situation
on
my
own
for
a
while,
I
eventually
discussed
it
with
the
professor,
who
assured
me
that
he
would
address
the
problem
with
the
student.
Unfortunately,
the
student
continued
his
pattern
of
not
showing
up
for
conferences
and
ignoring
my
e-mails.
I
once
again
informed
the
professor
of
the
situation.
He
assured
me
that
I
had
done
all
I
could
and
that
it
was
the
student
who
had
not
followed
through
on
his
responsibilities.
By
the
end
of
the
semester,
I
had
never
once
met
with
this
student.
However,
I
did
realize
that
WAs
can
only
help
students
who
actually
want
our
help.
We
can
make
ourselves
available
to
students
and
keep
professors
aware
of
the
situation,
but
we
cannot
force
anyone
to
meet
with
us.
On
the
bright
side,
for
every
student
who
thinks
that
meeting
with
WAs
is
a
waste
of
his
or
her
time,
there
are
several
students
who
really
do
value
our
input.
One
student
who
I
worked
with
during
the
past
year
especially
stands
out
to
me
in
this
regard.
She
was
a
decent
writer,
and
our
first
conference
went
fairly
well.
When
we
met
for
the
second
time,
she
confessed
that
she
had
not
revised
her
first
paper
at
all
after
we
had
met.
When
I
asked
her
why
this
was,
she
said
that
she
had
thought
her
paper
was
good
enough
without
any
revisions.
While
she
had
realized
that
her
paper
could
be
improved
upon,
she
was
accustomed
to
getting
AOs
and
had
thought
that
her
paper
would
receive
this
grade
without
any
improvements.
She
said
that
she
was
shocked
when
she
actually
only
earned
a
C
on
this
paper.
Based
on
her
professorOs
comments,
she
now
had
a
list
of
concerns
to
go
over
for
her
second
paper.
We
had
a
very
productive
conference,
and
the
next
time
I
saw
her
she
thanked
me
for
all
of
my
help.
She
told
me
that
she
had
improved
her
grade
to
an
A-
and
realized
the
importance
of
always
trying
to
do
her
best
work.
This
studentOs
nice
comments
helped
me
to
appreciate
my
work
as
a
WA.
It
is
encouraging
when
a
student
is
eager
to
have
a
conversation
about
a
paper,
and
it
is
even
more
encouraging
when
a
student
tells
you
that
you
were
helpful.
Another
time
when
I
felt
that
I
had
been
of
a
good
deal
of
assistance
in
my
work
as
a
WA
was
during
the
spring
semester
when
I
met
with
students
about
outlines
for
their
papers.
Before
this,
I
had
only
ever
discussed
drafts
of
papers
with
students.
In
those
situations,
students
usually
already
had
developed
the
main
points
they
wished
to
cover.
However,
when
students
only
had
outlines
completed,
I
was
able
to
have
extremely
productive
conversations
with
them
to
develop
in
which
direction
to
take
their
papers.
The
students
who
had
only
written
outlines
were
much
more
willing
to
discuss
higher
order
concerns,
like
thesis
and
organization,
rather
than
being
caught
up
in
lower
order
concerns,
such
as
grammar.
I
wish
I
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
more
students
at
this
stage
of
the
writing
process.
I
felt
like
I
really
was
able
to
have
interesting
conversations
with
the
students
with
their
work
and
to
have
an
impact
on
how
well
their
papers
were
written.
In
addition
to
having
several
experiences
that
have
caused
me
to
reflect
on
my
work
as
a
WA,
I
have
also
had
some
formative
experiences
concerning
my
own
writing
during
the
past
year.
The
biggest
writing
challenge
I
faced
was
learning
how
to
write
in
a
new
style
for
my
Feminist
Philosophy
class.
I
had
never
taken
a
philosophy
class
prior
to
this
point,
and
I
felt
a
little
intimidated
when
I
received
the
first
assignment.
I
realized
that
the
way
I
normally
write
for
my
English
was
different
from
the
writing
style
that
was
expected
for
this
class.
Luckily,
my
professor
was
very
encouraging
and
was
willing
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
meeting
with
students
to
discuss
our
work.
In
addition
to
requiring
a
first
draft
and
a
final
draft
of
each
of
our
two
major
papers,
she
also
let
us
continually
revise
throughout
the
semester.
I
wrote
four
very
different
drafts
of
my
first
paper
in
an
effort
to
convey
my
argument
in
the
most
effective
way.
My
professor
read
and
commented
on
all
of
these.
While
I
had
already
appreciated
the
value
of
revising,
I
truly
began
to
understand
how
a
paper
can
always
be
improved
upon
when
I
took
this
class.
My
first
draft
was
my
initial
attempt
to
make
a
coherent
argument
in
the
style
that
is
expected
for
philosophy
papers.
My
second
draft
was
a
completely
different
take
on
this
argument
after
I
rethought
my
position.
My
third
draft
was
a
combination
of
these
two
arguments
based
on
my
professorOs
suggestions,
I
made
minor
adjustments
to
the
paper
with
the
fourth
draft.
At
the
end
of
the
semester,
I
handed
all
of
these
drafts
into
my
professor.
As
I
looked
over
all
of
the
work
I
had
done,
I
could
really
appreciate
the
value
of
multiple
revisions,
especially
when
trying
to
tackle
a
difficult
project.
In
addition
to
Feminist
Philosophy,
another
class
I
took
during
the
past
year
that
challenged
me
as
a
writer
was
Writing
Genres.
The
assignments
in
this
class
required
students
to
write
in
a
variety
of
styles.
The
first
assignment
was
a
personal
reflection
essay,
the
second
was
a
comparison
of
several
of
the
texts
covered
in
the
class,
and
the
third
was
a
creative
project
involving
the
design
and
composition
of
our
own
magazines.
In
addition,
we
had
to
keep
a
blog
throughout
the
semester.
While
I
really
enjoyed
doing
them,
I
also
felt
the
most
challenged
by
the
magazine
and
the
blog
entries.
These
projects
were
very
different
from
the
type
of
schoolwork
that
I
was
accustomed
to
doing.
It
took
me
a
little
time
to
become
used
to
writing
in
the
casual
way
that
made
the
most
sense
for
these
projects.
Reading
my
classmatesO
blog
entries
helped
me
to
find
a
voice
that
I
was
comfortable
with
in
my
own
writing.
Another
challenge
that
I
faced
in
this
course
was
using
the
different
writing
techniques
we
were
learning.
I
especially
had
trouble
with
a
technique
referred
to
as
countering,
which
involves
challenging
claims
made
in
the
text
being
analyzed.
It
is
often
difficult
for
me
not
to
simply
accept
what
a
text
says
at
face
value.
I
had
to
train
myself
to
look
for
counter-arguments,
but
I
do
think
I
had
improved
in
this
skill
by
the
end
of
the
semester.
Even
though
this
writing
technique
was
difficult
for
me,
I
do
think
it
is
a
valuable
skill
to
have.
It
is
also
something
that
I
will
now
recommend
the
students
I
work
with
as
a
WA
try
in
their
own
writing
because
I
think
it
makes
for
a
stronger
paper.
Probably
the
biggest
writing
challenge
I
faced
during
the
past
year
occurred
as
part
of
the
summer
interim
class
I
took
in
Italy.
As
we
did
not
have
access
to
computers,
our
major
paper
assignment
was
to
be
handwritten.
This
may
not
sound
very
difficult,
but
I
am
so
accustomed
to
composting
papers
on
a
computer
that
I
found
it
to
be
quite
challenging.
I
tend
to
edit
my
papers
as
I
go,
constantly
rewording
sentences
and
rearranging
the
order
of
paragraphs.
I
also
have
a
tendency
to
skip
the
outlining
step
of
the
writing
process.
I
usually
have
a
general
idea
of
how
I
plan
to
develop
my
paper,
but
I
do
not
actually
write
it
down
in
any
organized
fashion.
I
understand
why
outlining
could
be
useful,
but
it
is
easier
for
me
to
think
ideas
out
as
I
write.
I
began
writing
my
paper
in
the
same
fashion
that
I
normally
do.
However,
I
soon
ran
into
trouble
when
I
decided
I
wanted
to
change
parts
of
the
paper
after
only
writing
a
page
or
so.
After
restarting
my
paper
three
times,
I
finally
decided
that
I
needed
to
outline
my
ideas
before
proceeding
with
the
rest
of
the
paper.
This
did
help
me
to
maintain
organization
without
going
back
to
shift
paragraphs
around
the
paper.
I
did
still
find
myself
wanting
to
change
some
minor
elements
of
how
I
constructed
my
sentences,
but
I
eventually
decided
that
it
was
not
worth
worrying
about
minor
things
that
only
I
would
notice.
Since
I
found
writing
the
outline
to
be
helpful
in
this
situation,
I
do
think
I
will
be
doing
more
outlining
for
the
papers
I
write
during
the
coming
year.
I
think
that
outlining
could
help
my
writing
to
flow
more
smoothly.
I
also
think
that
it
could
help
me
to
write
a
bit
more
quickly.
It
usually
takes
me
a
rather
long
time
to
write
a
paper
because
I
am
constantly
pausing
to
think
about
where
I
want
to
take
the
paper
next.
I
will
probably
continue
to
do
a
lot
of
thinking
as
a
paper
develops,
but
thinking
through
the
general
outline
of
a
paper
before
I
begin
writing
could
certainly
help
me
to
write
a
little
more
quickly.
I
have
learned
quite
a
bit
about
writing
and
about
being
a
WA
during
the
past
year.
The
best
pieces
of
advice
that
I
could
offer
to
new
WAs
are
things
that
sound
quite
simple
but
that
can
be
easy
to
forget.
First,
I
would
recommend
not
scheduling
too
many
conferences
in
a
row.
I
had
heard
this
advice
myself
but
decided
to
ignore
it
because
I
was
having
an
extremely
busy
week
and
wanted
to
get
the
conferences
over.
However,
what
I
found
out
was
that
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
give
students
my
full
concentration
after
doing
more
than
four
conferences
in
a
row.
I
also
realized
that
spreading
the
conferences
out
over
the
course
of
a
week
allows
me
to
spread
out
reading
the
papers,
which
makes
it
easier
for
me
to
remember
specific
elements
of
each
paper.
Every
student
deserves
the
same
level
of
concentration
from
me,
and
I
have
realized
that
I
am
only
able
to
provide
that
if
I
spread
my
conferences
out
enough.
I
also
like
to
make
notes
about
each
paper
for
myself
(not
on
the
paper
itself
but
on
a
separate
sheet).
I
look
these
over
right
before
each
conference
to
remind
myself
what
I
see
as
the
most
important
points
to
discuss.
Overall,
the
most
important
thing
I
have
learned
about
being
a
WA
is
the
necessity
of
trying
to
make
each
student
feel
comfortable.
It
is
up
to
the
students
we
are
working
with
the
guide
the
conferences.
I
have
learned
how
not
to
put
the
points
I
wish
to
discuss
above
the
points
the
students
wishes
to
discuss.
They
are,
after
all,
the
studentsO
conferences,
and
the
WAs
are
just
there
to
help
the
students
as
much
as
we
can.
