Writing:
A
World
of
My
Own
I
have
always
been
a
bookworm.
When
I
was
younger,
and
perhaps
even
now,
my
parents
would
check
up
on
me,
to
make
sure
I
was
not
reading
novels
from
the
library
instead
of
finishing
my
homework
for
school.
I
immersed
myself
in
the
world
of
literature
at
a
young
age.
Reading
was
my
greatest
escapebauthors
and
their
characters
became
my
friends;
their
stories
intertwined
with
mine.
The
books
of
my
childhood,
from
those
of
L.M.
Montgomery
to
Louisa
May
Alcott
to
C.S.
Lewis,
have
all
managed
to
remain
cherished
novels,
still
close
to
my
heart.
Every
once
in
a
while,
I
will
pick
up
one
of
them
and
read
for
hours
about
the
adventures
of
Rose
and
her
cousins,
whom
Alcott
has
so
beautifully
fashioned,
or
Montgomeryes
orphaned
Anne,
whose
tendency
toward
drama
mirrors
my
own.
The
first
time
I
wrote,
my
mother
claims,
was
when
I
dictated
a
show
ne
tell
presentation
to
her,
about
my
sheltie
and
his
third
place
ribbon
in
a
Lassie
Look-Alike
contest.
Though,
she
says,
the
first
time
that
I
wrote
something
by
myself
may
have
been
a
story
about
a
dog
and
his
adventures.
She
does
know,
however,
that
I
received
praise
for
my
writing
from
the
start.
Still,
I
did
not
think
of
myself
as
a
writer,
but
as
a
readerbreading
continued
to
remain
my
favorite
entertainment
until
I
discovered
that
I
could
be
the
author,
too.
I
found
that
I
could
create
a
world
of
my
own,
but
not
just
in
fiction.
I
have
learned
that
a
historical
essay
or
critical
literary
analysis
can
also
be
an
authores
world,
in
which
the
author
herself
is
the
protagonist.
That
particular
revelation
occurred
sometime
in
my
middle
school
years,
though
it
feels
too
far
back
in
time
to
remember
exactly
when.
My
experience
with
writing
not
as
a
student
only
doing
what
was
asked
of
her,
but
as
a
writer,
began
in
my
eighth
grade
year,
in
Mrs.
Reidereres
English
class.
Mrs.
Reiderer
was
a
short,
thin
older
woman,
who
had
big
blue
eyes
and
the
most
encouraging
smile.
Every
week,
she
would
put
up
an
inspirational
quote
on
the
board,
ranging
from
anonymous
to
Emily
Dickinson.
One
week,
as
we
neared
the
end
of
our
time
in
middle
school,
she
put
up
a
quote
on
the
board
that
has
inspired
me
to
become
the
best
I
could
bebvShoot
for
the
moon,g
it
said.
vEven
if
you
miss
it,
youell
still
land
among
the
stars.g
I
cannot
remember
who
said
the
quote,
but
each
time
I
have
heard
it
since,
I
picture
that
classroom
and
the
words
on
the
white
board
in
Mrs.
Reidereres
looping
script
in
deep
blue.
Eighth
grade
was
a
very
difficult
year
for
me
and
inspiration
was
something
that
I
needed,
both
academically
and
on
a
personal
level.
I
had
been
at
the
same
school,
Stone
Ridge,
since
second
grade,
when
I
begged
my
mother
to
let
me
go
to
the
all-girl
Catholic
school
that
she
had
attended
for
high
school.
When
eighth
grade
came
along
and
I
decided
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
change
schools
for
high
school,
it
was
a
very
complicated
decision
to
make.
I
was
leaving
my
best
friend,
the
only
girl
in
the
school
to
whom
I
felt
very
close,
to
venture
out
of
my
comfort
zone
and
make
new
friends
at
a
new
schoolbagain,
all-girl
and
Catholic.
All
of
this
managed
to
make
its
way
into
my
eighth
grade
journal.
Throughout
each
trimester,
I
sat
down
at
the
computer
to
create
16
pages
of
a
journal.
I
typed
out
random
thoughts,
such
as
a
list
of
who
I
would
invite
to
my
inauguration
if
I
ever
became
Ruler
of
the
World
(five
times
mentioning
my
current
celebrity
crush),
to
small
essays
on
the
books
I
was
currently
reading
and
how
they
related
to
my
life,
helping
me
to
craft
my
own
opinions
about
other
novels.
These
small
essays
paralleled
the
longer
theses,
argumentative
essays
on
novels
of
my
choice,
approved
by
Mrs.
Reiderer.
I
wrote
for
hours
about
Cold
Sassy
Treees
Lightfoot
and
her
relationship
with
Will
Tweedy
and
Enderes
Gamebthe
child
who
is
able
to
conquer
all,
even
as
a
small
orphan.
The
journal
and
the
essays
of
my
eighth
grade
year
cannot
compare,
however,
to
the
short
story
I
wrote
for
my
last
journal,
in
an
effort
to
fill
up
the
last
pages
of
the
assignment.
It
was
not
my
first
attempt
at
creative
writing,
but
it
was
the
first
attempt
in
which
I
felt
an
intense
pride
because
I
knew
it
was
the
story
itself
that
was
keeping
the
reader
on
their
toes.
Mrs.
Reiderer
was
not
just
impressed
by
how
well
the
story
was
written
by
a
such
young
writer,
but
by
the
story
itself.
In
an
English
course
at
Lafayette,
I
learned
that
the
contemporary
writer
experiments
with
form
in
her
writings,
such
as
in
Alice
Munroes
short
story
vWilderness
Station,g
which
is
written
completely
in
letters
from
the
different
characters.
I
suppose
that
even
in
eighth
grade,
I
was
trying
to
write
different
ways.
My
eighth
grade
short
story,
which
I
entitled
vPerfect,g
was
written
in
diary
format,
in
first
person
narrative
from
the
protagonist,
a
teenage
girl
who
is
wiser
than
one
might
think
a
young
girl
to
be.
Although
the
story
has
taken
different
twists
and
turns
in
plot
and
in
format
in
the
many
versions
I
have
written
since,
her
name
has
never
changed:
Samantha
Richardson,
the
brown-haired
beauty
of
perfection,
who
wants
to
be
okay
with
just
being
her
flawed
self.
A
week
or
so
later,
Mrs.
Reiderer
handed
back
our
journals.
I
read
through
her
beginning
comments
with
a
smile
as
she
laughed
at
the
silly
entries,
putting
smiley
faces
next
to
what
words
had
caught
her
eye.
She
wrote
about
my
sense
of
humor
and
how
she
generally
enjoyed
reading
my
journal
compared
to
others.
Happily,
I
flipped
to
the
final
page.
There
was
the
grade,
an
A.
I
had
hoped
for
that
grade,
but
I
could
never
have
imagined
what
came
after
the
big
red
letterbher
last
remark.
She
wrote,
vYou
are
a
seriously
talented
writer.g
I
had
seen
the
word
vseriouslyg
earlier
on
in
the
journal
as
I
had
skimmed.
Another
comment,
at
the
end
of
my
short
story:
vThis
is
a
seriously
good
story.
Do
you
want
to
get
it
published?g
she
asked.
Folded
in
half,
creased
to
perfection,
and
tucked
into
the
back
of
my
journal
was
a
list
of
publishers
for
young
adult
short
fiction.
I
thought
about
pursuing
it,
but
ultimately
decided
not
to
in
favor
of
turning
that
short
story
into
a
novel
one
day.
Mrs.
Reidereres
praise
and
otherse
has
encouraged
me
to
become
the
writer
I
am
today.
With
their
help,
I
have
cultivated
my
writing
skills
in
both
academic
and
creative
writing.
I
grew
as
a
writer
in
high
school
at
Georgetown
Visitation.
Visitation
graduates
seem
to
go
to
college
and
discover
that
although
the
workload
is
difficult,
as
writers,
they
are
prepared
for
college
curriculum.
Our
math
skills,
depending
on
the
student,
may
not
strike
a
professor
as
outstanding,
but
almost
all
students
have
been
complimented
and
admired
for
their
essay
writing.
Expository
essays,
research
papers,
creative
writingbI
learned
to
write
them
all
well
at
Visitation.
Although
my
history
classes
taught
me
how
to
analyze
historical
events
and
figures,
my
science
classes
taught
me
to
write
a
lab
report
and
to
explain
things
logically,
and
my
other
classes
broadened
my
mind
and
taught
me
to
think
and
write
for
myself,
it
was
in
my
English
classes
that
my
writing
was
most
scrutinized
and
where
I
grew
the
most
as
a
writer.
In
freshman
year
of
high
school,
although
we
studied
the
Odyssey
and
other
great
novels
and
wrote
long
essays
discussing
our
opinions,
poetry
was
the
most
memorable
of
my
writing
experiences.
I
had
never
had
the
chance
to
explore
poetry
as
a
writer,
and
Mr.
Neill
taught
us
how
to
analyze
a
poem,
looking
at
meter
and
of
course,
language
and
historical
context.
When
we
wrote
our
own
poetry
that
year,
it
gave
me
the
chance
to
delve
into
the
poet
inside
me.
A
few
years
later,
when
Mr.
Neill
was
gone
from
the
Visitation
faculty,
he
chanced
upon
my
aunt
at
a
function,
who
mentioned
me.
vAh,
the
poet.
She
was
an
amazing
poet.
Very
impressive,g
he
replied
to
her,
remembering.
Sophomore
year,
I
focused
on
my
essay
writing
in
Mrs.
Mattinglyes
English
class,
fifth
period.
Despite
Visitationes
insistence
that
there
were
no
levels
in
classes,
except
for
honors
and
AP
(nonexistant
for
sophomores),
Mrs.
Mattingly
questioned
my
placement
in
the
class,
because
my
writing,
reading,
and
analytical
skills
were
higher
than
that
of
my
classmates.
Her
praise
stunned
me
and
upped
my
confidence
in
the
classroom
and
as
a
writer.
I
wrote
analytical
essays
on
Charles
Dickens,
or
Chuck
as
we
called
him
in
class,
and
his
novel
A
Tale
of
Two
Cities,
on
Edgar
Allan
Poees
Annabel
Lee,
on
the
unabridged
version
of
Victor
Hugoes
Hunchback
of
Notre
Dame,
on
Shakespearees
Macbeth,
and
many
more.
With
each
essay,
Mrs.
Mattinglyes
constructive
criticism
and
her
encouragement
helped
me
to
write
better
and
to
edit
my
own
writing
to
the
best
of
my
abilities.
By
the
time
junior
year
came
around,
I
was
on
the
AP
English
track.
In
Mrs.
Hamiltones
AP
English
Language
and
Rhetoric
class,
we
studied
essays
in
addition
to
novels,
plays,
and
poetry.
We
wrote
our
first
real
research
paper
that
year,
on
Huckleberry
Finn
and
whether
it
should
be
taught
in
public
schools,
completing
our
research
with
full
access
to
Georgetown
Universityes
library.
I
learned
to
make
my
writing
as
persuasive
as
possible,
to
find
the
best
support,
and
to
come
up
with
unique
arguments
and
thesis
statements.
Mrs.
Hamilton
taught
me
how
to
improve
my
essay
writing,
probably
to
the
level
at
which
it
is
today.
I
also
learned
how
to
read
criticallybwhether
it
was
an
essay,
a
novel,
a
play,
or
a
poemband
to
edit
my
peerse
writing
to
make
their
arguments
as
concise
and
focused
as
possible.
Another
large
part
of
my
life
as
a
writer
is
that
of
journalist.
I
became
interested
in
journalism
as
an
eighth
grader,
when
my
cousin
was
a
writer
for
Teen
Vogue.
I
joined
the
paper
as
a
freshman
in
high
school,
The
Wicket.
Throughout
my
career
as
a
staff
writer,
Profiles
editor,
Arts
and
Entertainment
Editor,
and
Freshmen
Mentor,
I
wrote
for
many
different
sections,
including
the
ones
that
I
have
edited.
The
summer
between
junior
year
and
senior
year,
I
stayed
at
Washington
and
Lee
University
for
a
month
as
a
summer
scholar.
I
took
three
classes:
law
and
the
media,
broadcast
media,
and
print
journalism.
At
the
end,
I
had
written
a
script
of
my
own
reporting
for
television,
edited
my
own
broadcast
reporting,
produced
our
classe
newscast,
and
written
and
published
an
article
online.
It
helped
me
grow
as
a
person,
a
journalist,
and
a
writer.
In
my
final
year
at
Visitation,
I
dropped
science
to
take
Creative
Writing.
Within
our
small
class
of
eight,
we
read
aloud
our
stories,
poetry,
plays,
and
screen
scripts
as
we
became
increasingly
comfortable
with
our
writing
and
therefore,
as
writing
was
an
extension
of
the
self,
with
ourselves.
In
addition
to
my
creative
writing,
I
was
once
again
in
AP
Englishbthis
time
for
Literature.
Although
my
essays
in
AP
English
continually
improved
and
grew
more
convincing
in
their
arguments,
the
most
memorable
of
my
writings
was
actually
a
creative
writing
assignment.
I
had
been
given
a
list
of
essay
topics
for
a
paper
on
The
Sound
and
the
Fury.
The
last
one
on
the
page
was
to
write
Caddyes
missing
chapter,
imitating
William
Faulkneres
voice.
We
had
to
explain,
before
the
chapter
began,
how
we
had
to
decided
to
write
the
way
we
did.
After
much
contemplation,
I
wrote
Caddyes
chapter
in
first
person,
because
she
is
so
central
to
the
novel.
I
felt
she
should
be
allowed
to
tell
her
own
story
because
it
had
affected
so
many.
It
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
combine
both
creative
writing
and
academic
writing,
which
was
rewarding
to
me
as
a
writer,
as
I
had
to
imitate
another
authores
voice
while
putting
my
own
voice
into
the
well-researched
chapter.
All
this
needed
to
fit
into
the
book
as
if
it
had
been
Faulkneres
own.
The
grade
and
the
praise
I
received
from
my
last
high
school
English
teacher
encouraged
me
to
continue
with
creative
writing
in
college,
in
addition
to
my
academic
writing,
and
taught
me
that
it
was
possible
to
combine
the
two.
When
I
arrived
at
Lafayette
last
year,
I
felt
like
I
was
prepared
to
write
anything,
and
I
was
preparedbfor
my
history
class,
my
English
classes,
my
natural
science
courses,
and
for
The
Lafayette.
However,
when
it
came
to
my
first
year
seminar,
I
hit
a
bit
of
a
obstacle.
The
essays
were
unlike
anything
I
had
ever
had
to
writebhistorical,
argumentative,
and
creative
all
in
one.
Description
was
keybthe
reader
needed
to
be
able
to
see
objects
mentioned
in
the
paper,
to
imagine
them
perfectly,
or
else
my
arguments
as
to
whether
the
objects
were
authentic
were
not
credible.
I
had
to
learn
to
write
differently,
so
I
adjusted
to
it.
After
a
year
at
Lafayette,
my
writing
has
dramatically
improved
and
I
can
call
myself
a
writer
with
true
confidence
in
my
abilities,
at
least
for
the
present.
I
know
that
there
is
still
much
more
to
learn.
