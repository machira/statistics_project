Returning
Writing
Assistant
Assignment:
In
and
through
its
Writing
Associates,
the
College
Writing
Program
develops
highly
valued
skills.
Many
of
these
are
specific
to
the
literary
world,
but
others
can
be
implemented
in
unexpected
ways.
In
the
past
year,
among
other
things,
my
WA
experience
has
taught
me
what
my
own
abilities
really
are
and
where
I
can
apply
them
when
I
graduate
from
Lafayette
and
embark
on
a
career
of
my
own.
Specifically,
what
follows
are
the
benefits
I've
received
from
becoming
a
WA.
In
the
past
year
I
have
changed
my
writing
neither
in
style
nor
in
process,
but
my
self-image
as
a
writer
has
evolved.
My
writing
experiences
in
class
and
my
attempts
to
identify
the
career
for
which
I
am
best
suited
have
both
yielded
new
insight
to
this
self-concept.
As
a
WA,
I
have
gained
the
practical
analytical
skills
that
enable
me
now
to
interpret
this
insight
and
use
it
to
choose
a
career.
My
father
first
suggested
Journalism
as
a
possible
career
option
for
me,
an
English
major
absent
direction.
As
I
read
about
the
career
and
the
life
that
might
possibly
await
me,
I
reached
the
conclusion
that
I
am
not
cut
out
for
such
a
career.
A
journalist
deals
with
many
pressures,
deadlines
foremost
among
those.
Though
I
can
deal
responsibly
with
deadlines,
the
strict
requirements
of
ever-present
publication
timetables
exist
in
contradiction
to
my
strengths
and
leanings.
I've
discovered
that
I
am,
to
the
limits
of
time
and
ability,
a
perfectionist
in
my
writing.
This
works
to
my
advantage
when
time
allows,
but
does
not
expedite
my
work.
I
would
never
feel
that
any
article
I
sent
to
print
was
"finished."
I
would
much
rather
work
and
rework
a
piece
of
writing.
I
find
that
I
often
have
the
desire
to
rework
papers
even
after
they've
received
a
final
grade.
I
couldn't
be
comfortable
printing
story
after
unfinished
story.
In
dealing
with
other
writers
I
have
been
able
to
identify
my
own
tendencies
as
a
writer
and
thereby
narrow
down
my
career
options.
I've
met
many
students
in
my
WA
experience
who
choose
whatever
means
of
expressing
a
thought
that
come
most
immediately
to
mind.
While
arguably
less
precise,
this
approach
has
its
advantages,
namely,
the
work
gets
done.
When
employed
judiciously,
this
method
can
be
as
expressive
as
any.
Tolstoy
was
a
perfectionist
in
word
choice,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
he
cannot
be
translated
several
ways;
there
is
usually
more
than
one
way
to
express
an
idea.
I
too
am
meticulous
in
my
selection
of
words
and
phrases,
often
evaluating
many
options
for
economic
expression,
connotation,
and
"feel."
I
revise
continually
as
I
write,
taking
such
pains
that
my
work
is
regularly
prolonged.
I
do
this
because
I
believe
that,
when
chosen
with
great
care,
a
writer's
words,
the
"right"
words,
achieve
a
meaning
beyond
the
sum
of
the
of
the
parts,
an
un-translatable
meaning.
Though
taxed
by
the
same
goals,
a
journalist
can
afford
no
such
delays.
To
a
grader
or
readers
of
a
periodical
my
efforts
would
most
likely
go
unnoticed,
but
I
derive
my
literary
fulfillment
from
the
extent
to
which
I
feel
I
have
succeeded
in
this
selection
process,
and,
to
be
a
journalist
unable
to
write
thus
would
be,
for
me,
to
be
a
writer
unfulfilled.
While
I
honed
my
writing
in
class,
I
continued
the
search
for
a
career.
Several
other
possibilities
unrelated
to
this
paper
came
and
went.
Eventually,
I
considered
becoming
a
professor.
The
academic
environment
appeals
to
me
very
much.
It
inspires
me,
gives
me
confidence
and
the
luxury
of
peers
with
whom
to
discuss
ideas
that
intrigue
me,
but
the
pressure
to
produce
novel
work
to
publish
in
order
to
advance
a
career
repels
to
me
in
the
same
way
that
deadline
pressures
deter
me
from
journalism.
In
addition,
I
feel
that
mine
time
would
be
too
divided.
The
host
of
responsibilities
that
a
professor
must
balance
would
overwhelm
my
ability
to
write.
When
I
write,
the
process
takes
over
everything
else
that
I
am
doing.
I
am
best
able
to
convey
my
ideas
when
I
have
the
time
to
immerse
myself
in
them.
That
is
how
I
take
control
of
those
ideas.
Over
all,
I
believe
the
collegiate
setting
would
distract
me
enough
to
prevent
me
becoming
a
productive
writer.
My
classes
also
provided
a
number
of
writing
experiences
that
helped
me
understand
myself
better
as
a
writer.
I
have
always
performed
well
in
analytical
and
critical
writing,
but
I
imagined
myself
more
as
a
fiction
writer,
possibly
because
that
is
what
I
prefer
to
read.
J.
R.
R.
Tolkien's
trilogy
"The
Lord
of
the
Rings"
was
a
major
influence
on
all
my
early
writing
attempts
as
well
as
most
of
my
reading
selections.
The
release
of
a
film
version
and
my
subsequent
re-reading
of
the
beloved
books
reawakened
in
me
the
desire
to
create
such
an
epic,
reminded
me
of
my
desire
to
become
a
fiction
writer.
This
year
I
had
the
opportunity
to
test
myself
in
that
regard.
Looking
at
my
own
work
with
the
eyes
of
a
Writing
Associate
I
learned
that
there
need
not
be
a
strong
correlation
between
my
favorite
type
of
reading
and
my
favorite
type
of
writing.
When
I
wrote
critically,
I
was
able
to
solidify
my
thoughts
and
observations,
to
manipulate
them
literally
and
with
clear
objectives.
In
a
paper
analyzing
Tolstoy's
works
I
communicated
succinctly
the
relevant
points
and
the
result
was
a
strong
paper.
I
imagined
that
I
would
be
able
to
manipulate
the
subtext
of
a
fictional
story
as
well
as
I
might
the
un-translatable
quality
of
critical
writing.
When
offered
the
opportunity
to
try,
I
hit
a
wall.
In
an
assignment
to
write
a
fictional
story
about
the
Devil
coming
to
Lafayette
I
could
not
approach
my
goals
logically
because
they
lay
almost
entirely
in
a
feeling
that
I
wanted
to
convey.
Thoughts
that
were
clear
when
I
wrote
to
inform,
became
cloudy,
printed
in
gray
scales,
when
I
wrote
my
story.
I
lost
focus
on
everything
I
intended
to
imply.
The
result
was
a
loosely
constructed
sequence
of
events
with
little
or
no
direction.
I'm
not
a
fiction
writer,
or
to
be
one
would
take
a
great
deal
of
work,
but
at
least
I
know
that.
My
best
work
is
in
argumentative
and
critical
writing.
Eventually
I
focused
on
a
legal
career.
I
think
that
the
demands
such
a
career
would
place
on
me
seem
to
align
most
directly
with
my
abilities
and
my
joys
as
a
writer.
In
a
legal
brief
economic
and
unequivocal
language
is
paramount.
I
will
be
able
to
indulge
my
desires
as
a
writer
and
my
literary
goals
will
become
my
professional
goals.
I
will
still
be
under
pressure
to
write,
but
not
under
pressure
to
produce
novel
concepts
or
connections
that
I
will
not
have
time
to
fully
refine.
The
ideas
I
write
about
will
be
both
my
associates'
and
mine.
Their
plain
expression
will
be
important
but
the
ideas
will
not
be
of
a
gray-scale
nature.
Their
clear
expression
will
be
easier
for
me
because
they
are
unambiguous
notions,
notions
my
life
will
be
steeped
in
if
I
do
become
a
lawyer.
A
legal
career
is
likely
as
well
to
provide
the
academia
and
the
peers
that
would
lure
me
to
a
professorship,
without
the
distractions
of
responsibilities
unrelated
to
my
writing.
I've
found
this
year
how
much
such
an
environment
appeals
to
me.
I
spent
nearly
all
my
time
in
the
beginning
of
this
year
reading
and
writing.
It
was
a
lifestyle
I
loved.
The
unfortunate
truth
is
that
other
responsibilities
inevitably
divert
my
attentions
from
that
way
of
life
that
I
so
enjoy.
As
a
lawyer
I
think
I
would
find
myself
absorbed
in
the
same
life
of
reading
and
writing
and
study
that
captivated
me
this
year.
Largely
through
evaluating
my
strengths
and
weaknesses
as
a
writer,
I
have
acquired
a
better
understanding
of
my
career
possibilities.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
has
had
a
number
of
other
benefits
for
me
as
well.
My
experience
working
with
a
First
Year
Seminar
and
then
later
in
Drop-in
meetings
helped
me
to
learn
a
great
deal
about
writing,
responsibility,
and
teamwork.
My
classes
have
served
to
corroborate
the
lessons
I've
learned
in
Pardee
319.
Reading
the
papers
of
so
many
writers
has
benefited
me
by
allowing
me
to
familiarize
myself
with
the
expectations
that
a
writer
can
reasonable
hold
for
his
or
her
audience.
I
have
learned
that
I
suffer
from
a
fear
that
a
reader
will
not
understand
my
meaning
whenever
I
attempt
to
allude
to
a
thought.
If
a
thought
has
been
previously
illustrated,
then
a
reader
can
be
reasonably
expected
to
recall
it
without
blatant
restating
of
the
whole
point.
A
repeated
word
or
phrase
can
often
serve
to
summon
prior
explanations.
One
important
lesson
I
have
learned
from
this
is
that,
though
reading
other
people's
work
is
one
good
way
to
understand
the
expectations
one
can
have
of
a
reader,
the
best
way
is
to
ask
the
readers
themselves.
That
is
what,
for
me,
makes
the
WA
program
so
essential
to
good
writing
in
college.
It's
a
service
I
avail
myself
of
as
often
as
possible,
and
one
I
intend
to
use
and
promote
more
after
my
experiences
this
year.
I
have
seen
that
everything
written
relates
somehow
to
everything
else
written.
We
explored
this
relationship
in
one
of
my
classes
this
year.
In
that
class
we
discussed
Shakespeare
in
relation
to
Petrarch
among
others.
What
I
learned
is
that
no
written
word
stands
alone.
Having
seen
that
in
historical
cases,
it
was
interesting
to
see
it
in
practice
as
a
WA.
When
working
with
an
FYS,
my
only
exposure
to
the
material
was
what
I
got
from
the
professor
and
what
I
saw
in
the
students'
papers.
These
papers
could
not
exist
for
me
in
isolation,
because
it
was
only
in
their
conglomerate
whole
that
I
was
able,
as
a
new
WA,
to
see
what
the
individual
writers
needed
to
know
or
hear
in
order
to
pull
their
papers
together.
A
Writing
Associate
cannot
merely
glean
what
he
or
she
needs
to
know
from
the
papers
of
the
students.
The
professor
is
the
only
person
who
can
tell
you
what
he
or
she
is
looking
for
in
the
papers.
This
is
where
teamwork
becomes
important.
It
is
essential
that
a
WA
makes
and
maintains
contact
with
the
professor
to
whom
he
or
she
is
assigned.
That
keeps
the
WA
up
to
date
on
the
expectations
of
the
class
and
on
the
progress
of
the
students.
Teamwork
also
is
something
that
becomes
important
among
the
WA's
themselves.
When
the
drop-in
service
is
swamped
(as
does
sometimes
happen)
and
another
WA
is
waiting
for
a
late
or
missed
appointment
(oh,
it
happens
a
lot!),
the
free
WA's
will
sometimes
help
the
drop-ins
out.
We
also
work
together
on
presentations
for
our
meeting
or
for
conferences.
As
writing
operates
as
a
whole,
the
WA
program
must
as
well.
WA's
work
with
each
other
and
learn
from
each
other.
No
WA
can
successfully
complete
his
or
her
task
to
help
other
writers
without
taking
into
account
the
experiences,
triumphs
and
failures,
wisdom
and
folly
of
other
WA's,
and
even
similar
programs
around
the
country.
No
tutoring
or
mentoring
or
peer
reading
service
is
perfect.
We
learn
and
work
with
each
other,
especially
with
the
students
that
use
the
service,
and
that
is
why
our
methods
work.
Every
WA
has
something
that
he
or
she
brings
to
the
group
that
makes
this
teamwork
work.
I
have
seen
some
small
part
of
that
now
that
I
have
participated
in
the
interview
process
on
both
the
side
of
the
applicant
and
the
reviewer.
I
would
advise
each
new
WA
to
think
a
little
about
what
their
particular
addition
may
be.
You
may
find
that
not
all
the
other
WA's
entertain
or
employ
you're
approach,
try
to
understand
why
and
make
it
a
learning
experience,
but
don't
give
up
entirely
on
your
methods.
You
can't
be
that
far
off
base,
or
you
wouldn't
be
here.
The
WA
experience
is
a
learning
experience.
The
lessons
it
offers
are
not
just
for
now
but
for
life.
If
you
take
the
time
to
think
about
what
it
offers
you'll
find
that
you're
well
rewarded.
Explore
the
opportunities
available
to
a
WA
and
absorb
what
it
has
to
offer
you
and
don't
hold
back
on
what
you
have
to
offer
to
the
program.
