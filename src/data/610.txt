WRITING
HISTORY
Writing
has
always
been
a
part
of
my
experience
in
education.
Everything
I
was
taught
from
the
very
first
years
of
school,
whether
it
involved
math,
science
or
social
studies,
was
documented
by
writing.
A
writing
history
is
an
effective
way
to
track
an
individualOs
learning
progress
and
can
display
someoneOs
character.
The
diversity
of
genres
in
writing
mirrors
the
variety
of
qualities
and
personality
traits
people
can
have.
My
own
writing
history
is
unique
to
my
experiences
inside
and
outside
of
school.
It
reveals
how
my
writing
style
developed
to
the
way
it
is
now
and
can
also
help
how
I
can
improve
as
a
writer
for
the
future.
My
first
memory
of
writing
dates
back
to
when
I
was
in
first
grade.
The
writing
was
nothing
literary
or
notable.
It
was
writing
and
penmanship
down
to
its
bear
essentials.
In
the
first
grade,
I
was
taught
how
to
write
in
cursive.
Thinking
back,
I
can
clearly
retrace
those
upper
and
lower
case
letters
on
the
lines
that
were
large
enough
to
fit
four
college-ruled
lines.
The
paper
was
thin
and
scratchy
with
specks
of
woody
splinters
that
look
like
they
could
be
rubbed
out
with
an
eraser.
From
that
point
forward,
the
letters
would
fuse
into
words,
the
words
into
sentences,
the
sentences
into
paragraphs,
and
ultimately
the
paragraphs
would
accumulate
into
the
very
essays
and
compositions
that
express
my
thoughts
and
values.
As
a
first
grader,
writing
was
not
thought
of
as
an
art
form
that
could
create
surreal,
non-existent
worlds.
I
did
not
know
the
ability
of
poetry
to
exude
emotions.
Writing
was
merely
a
way
to
record
the
thoughts
in
my
head,
which
at
that
age,
were
not
the
most
elaborate
or
colorful.
There
was
no
filter
to
put
my
thoughts
in
any
logical
order.
From
hereon,
my
writing
would
become
a
little
more
creative,
a
little
more
wide-ranging
and
a
lot
more
coherent.
The
second
grade
marked
my
first
exposure
to
poetry.
Of
course
as
a
second
graders,
I
was
not
force-fed
anything
too
long
or
deep.
I
was
steered
towards
Japanese
haikus
instead
of
Shakespearean
rhyming
couplets.
I
learned
that
poetry
was
the
literary
vehicle
of
expression.
Our
second
grade
minds
tried
to
paint
the
picture
confined
within
those
three-lined
haikus.
Naturally,
we
were
assigned
to
create
our
own
haiku.
Along
with
the
words,
we
were
told
to
draw
an
illustration.
At
the
end
of
the
project,
all
the
haikus
were
collected
and
published
in
a
little
booklet
that
was
then
distributed
to
our
parents.
The
topics
of
these
poems
ranged
from
flowers
to
toy
cars.
They
shared
a
common
thread
of
tameness.
All
of
them
revealed
the
innocence
and
purity
of
an
eight
year
old.
Yet
my
haiku
was
the
outlier
that
shocked
the
parents
who
thought
they
would
be
reading
about
the
pleasant
fragrance
of
spring
flowers.
I
can
distinctly
remember
my
momOs
smile
turn
into
a
tight-lipped
frown
as
she
read
my
haiku.
Within
those
three
lines,
I
had
created
a
short
story
about
a
monster
that
wreaked
havoc
on
a
village,
killing
all
its
citizens.
My
illustration
was
no
less
prudent.
It
depicted
blood
and
bodies.
I
came
to
the
very
important
realization
that
words
had
the
power
to
anger
and
heighten
emotions.
This
I
learned
from
my
motherOs
reaction
to
my
writing.
Although
I
felt
remorseful
because
of
my
momOs
rebukes,
I
was
not
able
to
truly
feel
the
effects
that
the
words
had.
For
the
next
few
years
of
middle
school,
I
would
soon
be
able
to
experience
my
own
emotions
obtained
from
the
writings
of
other
people.
I
remember
reading
hundred
page
books
about
mysteries
and
fantasies.
Each
story
had
a
distinct
plot.
I
was
sucked
into
these
books,
unable
to
stop
reading
because
the
climax
was
building
up.
The
suspense
gave
a
tingling
sensation
in
my
fingertips
and
an
inability
to
tear
my
eyes
from
the
pages.
After
reading
many
of
these
books,
I
was
inspired
to
try
to
write
my
own
story.
I
wanted
to
create
my
own
characters
that
had
to
overcome
crises,
whether
realistic
or
bizarre.
While
unfortunately
I
no
longer
have
records
of
these
short
stories,
I
can
recall
attempts
at
an
imaginary
snowstorm
that
caused
many
problems
for
a
town.
I
learned
that
creating
a
coherent
plot
with
realistic
characters
was
extremely
difficult
and
did
not
ignite
the
same
feelings
that
the
books
I
read
did.
I
did
not
yet
have
the
experience
and
knowledge
about
writing
at
the
time.
I
now
understand,
however,
that
elementary
school
students
should
not
be
able
to
write
exquisite
and
complex
short
stories.
The
early
years
of
education
are
meant
to
foster
creativity
and
imagination,
not
perfect
syntax
and
grammar.
As
I
transitioned
from
elementary
to
middle
school,
my
outlook
on
reading
and
writing,
along
with
my
expectations
as
a
writer,
changed
also.
As
a
middle
school
student,
I
was
no
longer
dwelling
in
the
familiar
grounds
of
fictional
stories
and
poetry.
I
had
grown
into
a
reasoning
individual
who
was
mature
enough
to
be
introduced
to
essays
and
stories
with
greater
depth
and
complexity.
It
is
in
my
middle
school
English
classes
where
I
formally
learned
about
the
formalities
to
writing
an
essay.
I
recognized
the
importance
of
the
introduction
and
conclusion
to
uphold
the
paperOs
main
theme.
The
paragraphs
in
between
served
as
evidence
points
that
defended
the
authorOs
argument.
While
I
was
very
good
at
understanding
these
new
concepts
and
techniques,
it
was
very
challenging
to
exercise
them
in
my
own
writing.
These
challenges
were
most
stressfully
felt
when
I
had
to
take
the
Grade
Eight
Proficiency
Assessment
(GEPA).
During
my
tutoring
sessions
with
a
family
friend,
I
practiced
many
different
types
of
essays
ranging
from
persuasive
to
narrative.
With
the
persuasive
essay,
I
was
tested
to
reason
all
of
my
ideas
into
a
specific
argument
and
to
be
able
to
logically
prove
how
my
ideas
support
my
claim.
The
challenges
with
the
narrative
essay
were
similar.
It
required
me
to
put
ideas
into
a
single,
fluid
essay.
High
school
demanded
a
greater
sophistication
in
my
writing.
I
noticed
that
a
good
paper
required
the
common
themes
of
coherence
and
fluidity.
The
majority
of
my
exams
in
all
of
my
classes
had
an
essay
or
multiple
essay
components.
The
essays
on
science
exams
consisted
of
providing
substantial
evidence
to
support
your
answer.
Essays
on
history
classes
were
similar
in
its
specificity.
I
needed
to
provide
moments
in
history
that
either
reinforce
or
contradict
the
given
prompt.
It
was
in
this
stage
of
my
education
that
I
truly
understood
the
diversity
in
the
types
of
writing.
I
wrote
many
serious
essays
that
needed
to
fit
into
the
formal
mold
of
an
essay,
but
I
also
wrote
a
few
essays
that
were
more
personal
and
called
for
a
little
soul
searching.
In
my
favorite
high
school
class,
Theory
of
Knowledge,
our
final
exam
grade
was
defined
by
a
lengthy
twelve-page
paper
in
which
I
pretty
much
pieced
together
my
life
story
and
acquirement
of
my
knowledge
thus
far.
I
was
the
given
the
freedom
to
construct
the
paper
in
any
way
to
my
liking,
whether
it
be
a
compilation
of
episodes
throughout
my
life
or
one
life-changing
experience.
This
coming
of
age
essay
also
required
allusions
to
the
books
we
read
throughout
the
year
as
well
as
a
common
theme.
My
paper
dealt
with
the
theme
of
beauty.
I
had
recently
traveled
to
Paris,
Germany,
and
the
Czech
Republic
in
the
previous
summer
and
the
trip
had
truly
opened
my
eyes
to
the
wondrous
beauties
of
Europe
that
I
had
never
before
experienced
in
the
United
States.
I
discussed
the
difficulty
of
confining
beauty
to
one
connotation
and
its
malleable
ability
to
mark
tangible
objects,
such
as
people
and
objects,
and
abstract
concepts,
such
as
diversity
and
love.
I
learned
a
lot
about
myself
through
this
writing
experience.
The
twelve-page
minimum
page
requirement
allowed
for
a
more
detailed
look
into
a
specific
thesis.
This
opportunity
to
explore
my
own
knowledge
and
experiences
was
really
useful
when
it
came
time
to
write
my
college
essay.
While
the
idea
from
my
Theory
of
Knowledge
paper
was
very
similar
to
the
one
I
wanted
to
have
for
my
college
essay,
the
approach
and
expectations
were
very
different.
My
twelve-page
final
paper
wanted
me
to
be
able
to
expand
on
a
specific
thesis
and
really
looked
to
see
how
far
I
could
go
in
depth
about
my
topic.
The
college
essay,
however,
wanted
applicants
to
be
able
to
fit
a
lot
of
thought
and
idea
into
a
single-paged
paper.
Colleges
wanted
to
challenge
my
brevity
and
ability
to
be
concise
while
at
the
same
time,
creating
a
colorful
depiction
of
who
I
really
am.
Once
again,
I
chose
to
use
the
inspiration
I
had
gotten
from
my
prior
travels
and
connect
that
to
its
effect
on
how
I
saw
my
dual
nationality
and
how
it
changed
my
outlook.
My
essay
began
as
a
narrative,
describing
my
excitement
as
I
boarded
the
plane
for
my
long-awaited
trip
to
Europe.
The
rest
of
the
paper
was
a
balancing
act
that
combined
vivid
words
describing
what
I
saw
on
the
trip
with
carefully
constructed
sentences
revealing
my
life
changing
opinions.
I
needed
to
express
that
prior
to
the
trip,
I
had
been
ignorant.
Living
all
those
years
in
the
United
States
had
made
me
oblivious
to
life
outside
of
the
country.
What
I
had
believed
to
be
beautiful
seemed
unremarkable
to
what
I
saw
in
Europe.
What
I
had
assumed
to
be
convention
and
the
norm
turned
out
to
be
very
different
to
the
lifestyle
and
views
of
the
European
people.
The
exposure
to
such
different
cultures,
languages,
people,
food,
music,
and
society
could
have
caused
doubt
and
ambiguity
of
my
own
identity
and
status
quo.
However,
it
stirred
a
greater
appreciation
in
me
for
my
Korean
American
nationality
and
my
amazing
opportunity
to
be
a
part
of
two
cultures,
each
with
its
own
distinct
traditions
and
ways
of
life.
The
greatest
difficulty
I
found
was
in
conveying
all
of
what
I
had
learned
about
myself
in
the
previous
paragraph
in
a
single
page.
My
original
draft
was
shy
of
four
pages.
It
was
strange
to
have
a
surplus
of
writing
when
I
usually
struggled
to
meet
the
minimum
page
requirement
in
the
past.
It
was
very
challenging
to
try
to
cut
back
that
much
by
myself
and
I
decided
to
go
to
my
teachers
and
older
cousins
for
help.
When
I
reread
my
college
essay
now,
I
am
astonished
to
see
the
progress
from
my
initial
to
final
draft.
I
learned
so
much
about
how
to
be
direct
and
succinct
without
having
to
lose
the
color
of
my
experiences.
Due
to
my
experience
writing
the
college
essay,
along
with
the
many
essays
I
wrote
for
my
advanced
placement
English
class
in
high
school,
I
felt
very
prepared
to
start
my
writing
career
in
the
college
classroom.
I
was
still
nervous
about
writing
at
Lafayette
College.
The
school
was
prestigious
for
its
liberal
arts
education
and
I
knew
there
would
be
many
expectations
for
all
students
to
write
and
think
well.
One
of
my
biggest
challenges
writing
at
Lafayette
was
maintaining
the
balance
between
fluidity
and
conciseness,
especially
in
longer
papers.
My
essays
tended
to
be
choppy,
with
weak
transitioning
from
one
point
to
the
other.
If
I
tried
to
make
the
paper
flow
better,
I
would
often
fail
to
tie
each
point
back
to
the
thesis.
My
writing
has
gotten
exceedingly
better
in
the
past
few
years
and
I
believe
that
the
sheer
amount
of
writing
I
accomplished
was
a
main
cause.
As
a
Government
&
Law
and
English
major,
I
wrote
a
throng
of
papers
that
varied
in
length
and
genre.
After
writing
so
many
pieces
and
receiving
feedback
on
how
to
make
it
better
from
my
professors,
I
began
to
see
the
flaws
in
my
writing
and
strived
to
improve.
My
Introduction
to
American
Studies
class
provided
my
best
writing
experiences
and
truly
confirmed
my
love
for
reading
and
writing.
I
was
required
to
write
a
brief
one-page
paper
responding
to
every
article
we
read
along
with
weekly
formal
responses
that
were
two
to
three
pages.
For
the
midterm
and
final
exams,
I
wrote
longer
essays.
For
this
class,
I
wrote
around
a
total
of
fifty
pages.
The
frequency
and
length
of
the
writing
I
did
for
this
class
definitely
made
writing
easier
in
the
following
semesters.
Although
I
am
an
English
major,
I
am
aware
that
I
have
so
much
more
to
learn
about
writing.
I
believe
that
I
have
potential
but
I
still
lack
the
experience
and
practice.
I
consider
myself
a
better
reader
than
a
writer.
When
I
read
texts,
my
mind
fills
with
ideas.
While
I
have
so
much
to
write
about,
I
am
not
always
the
best
in
conveying
it
through
writing.
Even
by
the
time
I
graduate
from
Lafayette
College,
my
writing
will
still
have
room
for
improvement.
Writing
is
a
skill
that
is
not
natural
for
most
people.
It
requires
education,
practice,
and
experience.
I
am
confident
that
being
a
Writing
Associate
this
semester
will
not
only
contribute
to
the
learning
process
of
the
students
I
am
working
with,
but
will
also
add
onto
my
writing
history
and
allow
my
writing
skills
to
grow.
