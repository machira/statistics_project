Literacy
Narrative
WA
Workshop
Assignment
There
are
three
words
that
come
to
mind
when
I
attempt
to
describe
my
experience
over
the
past
year
as
a
writer.
They
are
attitude,
identity
and
ownership.
I
learned
them
as
lessons
which
helped
to
better
understand
my
writing
to
better
perform
my
duties
as
a
WA.
Considering
that
the
courses
I
took
this
past
year
involved
laboratory
report
writing,
my
writing
had
to
take
a
more
structured
form.
Apart
from
a
few
online
blogs
and
personal
poetry
activities,
I
scarcely
had
any
opportunity
to
churn
out
creativity
at
all.
Observation,
procedure,
analysis
and
conclusion
were
the
only
topics
I
wrote
under.
I
had
to
fit
the
mold
and
meet
the
demands
required
for
the
classes
or
fail.
Even
though
the
writing
I
dealt
with
was
somewhat
confining
it
progressively
helped
to
define
important
aspects
of
writing
and
the
thought
process
involved
in
it.
The
first
definition
it
gave
me
was
by
way
of
discipline,
and
the
need
to
have
the
correct
attitude
towards
a
piece
of
work.
My
initial
attitude
towards
report
writing
was
resentment
and
until
I
changed
my
attitude
I
encountered
a
lot
of
difficulty
with
this
type
of
writing.
Usually,
after
a
gruesome
laboratory
experiment,
all
I
wanted
to
do
was
forget
that
I
had
even
been
in
the
laboratory
and
not
recall
it
on
paper.
My
question
sometimes
was
why
the
professors
required
these
reports
anyway,
as
I
believed
they
already
knew
what
the
real
results
and
conclusions
for
each
experiment
was.
I
received
low
grades
for
the
first
few
reports
I
submitted.
My
impatience
with
unpleasantly
recollecting
information
that
I
had
already
spent
a
significant
amount
of
time
on
in
the
lab
made
me
quite
careless.
Each
time
I
sat
down
to
write
I
constantly
wondered
when
the
boredom
would
be
over.
Unfortunately,
my
carelessness
and
impatience
landed
me
unhappy
results.
My
failure
to
proof
read
my
reports
resulted
in
poor
grammatical
constructions
and
oversight
of
details
yielding
poor
results
and
unpleasant
grades.
It
was
really
difficult
thinking
of
me
on
one
level
as
someone
who
was
helping
others
with
their
writing
and
on
the
other
hand
as
someone,
a
student,
who
was
struggling
with
it.
I
realized
that
if
I
did
not
learn
the
NartO
of
report
writing,
I
was
going
to
have
to
settle
for
very
poor
grades
in
my
classes.
I
concluded
that
in
order
to
write
reports,
I
needed
to
adopt
the
correct
approach
towards
reports
and
the
best
beginning
point
was
to
change
my
resentment
towards
report
writing.
It
was
gradual
but
I
taught
myself
to
embrace
report
writing
and
view
it
as
a
necessary
discipline
that
I
needed
to
master
with
the
correct
attitude.
With
time,
I
chose
to
be
more
patient
with
my
writing
allowing
ample
time
to
read
and
reread
the
work
to
identify
flaws
and
weaknesses.
I
realized
with
the
first
attempt
at
patiently
editing
my
work
that
the
results
were
good
and
that
I
received
a
good
grade
for
my
effort.
I
subsequently
developed
a
method,
where
I
would
write,
print,
read,
edit
and
reprint
before
finally
presenting
for
grading.
Generally
this
method
worked
well
and
helped
to
identify
and
correct
all
the
errors
that
I
erstwhile
overlooked.
Although
there
are
rules
to
writing
lab
reports
one
cannot
help
discovering
their
own
uniqueness
in
their
presentations.
It
sounds
almost
counterintuitive
but
the
truth
becomes
obvious
when
two
people
who
did
the
same
experiment
and
got
the
same
results
report
them.
Often
results
from
the
experiments
the
class
conducted
were
similar
hence
it
was
up
to
each
writer
to
construct
sentences
to
present
the
results
and
ideas
in
a
way
that
best
represented
himself
or
herself
as
an
individual.
The
way
in
which
such
constructions
took
shape
often
determined
what
the
graders
considered
appealing
enough
to
receive
a
particular
grade.
Often
such
constructions
stemmed
from
an
individuals
experiences
and
nature
as
a
writer
which
helped
to
create
an
identity
for
their
report
pieces.
Although
using
the
identity
an
individual
creates
for
his
reports
as
a
means
of
grading
seems
subjective
and
unfair,
it
helps
in
differentiating
one
writer
from
another
as
different
writers
will
emphasize
different
things
in
their
reports.
With
time,
it
became
obvious
that
the
professors
and
Teaching
assistants
did
not
care
much
about
the
conclusions
for
most
experiments.
Hence,
the
only
interesting
portions
that
they
often
rewarded
were
thoughtful
well-written
suggestions
for
future
experimentation
and
possible
alternate
explanations
to
the
results
and
conclusion
obtained.
Noticing
this,
I
felt
the
urge
to
make
alternate
explanations
and
future
experimentation
a
necessary
addition
in
each
report.
Sometimes,
it
was
difficult
to
find
an
explanation
or
experimentation
idea
even
remotely
close
to
being
original
as
often
someone
may
have
had
the
same
idea
in
the
past.
Subsequently,
I
had
to
be
careful
and
alert
in
crediting
other
peoples
work
so
that
my
ideas
were
mine
and
I
credited
other
people
for
theirs.
In
other
instances,
all
I
had
to
do
was
add
some
length
or
depth
to
an
idea
that
someone
had
previously
proposed
and
the
graders
equally
rewarded
me
for
my
efforts.
I
suppose
the
professors
and
lab
TAs
were
more
interested
in
innovative
reports
as
opposed
to
a
bland
recounting
of
well-known
facts.
The
progressive
appeal
that
alternate
explanations
and
further
experimentation
gave
reports
was
indication
that
an
individual
(the
writer)
had
added
his/her
signature,
thumbprint
to
that
particular
area
of
study.
There
is
no
doubt
that
thumbprints
and
signatures
are
unique
characteristics
to
an
individualOs
identity.
As
such
adding
an
identity
to
a
report
means
a
willingness
and
readiness
to
own
that
report.
The
best
way
I
digested
this
lesson
was
by
relating
it
to
fashion
design.
Like
writers,
every
designer
faces
the
challenge
and
fear
of
owning
whatever
he/she
makes.
I
obtained
a
deeper
understanding
of
this
truth
through
a
reality
show
I
fell
in
love
with
this
past
year
called
project
runway.
I
stumbled
upon
the
show
one
night
while
visiting
a
friend
in
one
of
the
residence
halls
on
campus
and
loved
it
immediately.
On
the
show,
a
group
of
amateur
designers
designed
outfits
and
presented
them
for
judgment
by
a
group
of
fashion
experts.
I
liken
it
to
writing
because
each
designer
took
a
different
approach
to
the
construction
of
his/
her
garment
and
even
though
some
procedures
were
standard,
they
each
came
out
with
what
represented
their
vision.
Often
on
the
show,
the
designers
had
to
answer
questions
on
their
creation
on
the
runway.
I
was
particularly
amazed
when
sometimes
a
horrible
design
that
had
received
bad
scores
would
go
on
to
the
next
stage
of
the
competition
because
the
designer
succeeded
in
explaining
his/her
concept
and
was
not
ashamed
in
claiming
ownership
of
the
outfit.
Relating
the
show
to
writing,
I
realized
the
importance
of
claiming
ownership
of
a
piece
of
writing.
Subsequently
I
was
willing
to
inject
quality
into
my
reports,
as
I
knew
I
had
to
own
it
in
the
end.
In
effect,
I
knew
my
work
was
complete
only
when
I
could
say
that
it
was
something
I
have
done
and
I
am
proud
to
have
finished.
Interestingly,
all
this
time
that
I
was
making
these
discoveries
about
my
writing,
I
was
helping
others
with
their
writing
in
their
first
year
seminar
class
on
environmental
pollution
as
a
WA.
Even
though
they
are
not
supposed
to
think
so,
often
students,
especially
first
year
students
tend
to
think
that
WAs
are
the
best
writers
on
the
college
campus.
One
of
the
students
I
worked
with
as
a
WA
was
in
one
of
my
lab
sessions
and
so
I
imagined
this
was
what
he
thought
of
me.
I
keep
wondering
if
his
presence
in
my
class
and
the
pressure
that
came
with
it
was
contributory
to
me
quickly
learning
and
adopting
the
lessons
I
learned
about
report
writing.
Whether
his
presence
in
the
class
helped
or
not
was
immaterial
as
I
was
glad
to
have
learned
what
I
learned
for
the
sake
of
my
WA
conferences.
I
was
able
to
adopt
a
strategy
of
using
discourse
to
situate
a
studentOs
interest
in
the
class
and
subject
matter
initially.
Often
this
helped
to
depict
the
studentOs
attitude
towards
the
piece
of
writing
at
hand
as
their
words
often
revealed
how
exactly
they
felt
about
the
work.
Some
were
fascinated
by
the
work
and
the
subject
matter
where
as
others
cared
very
little
about
it
and
could
do
without
writing
a
paper
on
the
environment.
I
often
achieved
the
answer
about
the
attitude
of
the
writer
by
asking
general
questions
such
as
how
they
are
faring
in
the
class
and
how
they
enjoyed
writing
their
drafts
and
how
difficult
they
thought
writing
it
was.
Locating
the
studentOs
attitude
towards
the
piece
of
writing
often
helped
to
determine
the
next
step
in
the
conference.
I
was
fascinated
by
the
way
students
were
writing
to
agree
with
certain
generalities
when
their
attitudes
depicted
that
they
could
have
easily
written
a
more
convincing
piece
that
challenged
or
disagreed
with
such
generalities.
Often
they
were
reluctant
because
they
feared
being
penalized
for
disagreeing
with
the
accepted.
However,
I
tried
to
encourage
them
to
write
with
their
ideas
to
represent
themselves
as
individuals
because
that
is
the
only
way
they
could
own
a
piece
as
theirs.
Most
sessions
often
raised
discussions
that
often
ended
with
the
student
developing
some
ideas
that
were
theirs
and
not
just
mine.
I
always
felt
good
knowing
that
they
know
the
heart
of
the
work
was
complete
and
believed
that
they
were
going
to
put
their
efforts
into
producing
what
they
can
own
in
the
end.
The
road
to
working
with
students
was
as
expected
not
always
rosy
but
I
took
it
as
much
of
an
opportunity
to
learn
from
the
students
as
they
learned
from
me.
It
was
common
for
me
to
pick
up
a
dictionary
or
a
St
MartinOs
handbook
with
a
student
on
an
issue
that
I
thought
was
incorrect.
This
brought
closure
in
situations
where
there
was
a
repeated
mistake
or
the
student
disagreed
with
my
opinion
on
the
issue.
The
times
that
I
was
wrong,
I
was
glad
to
have
found
an
opportunity
to
learn
a
necessary
lesson.
A
recurring
situation
that
stood
out
to
me
was
the
use
of
NeffectO
and
NaffectO.
Many
students
seemed
to
have
a
problem
using
the
correct
one
at
the
right
time
and
would
use
one
when
the
other
is
actually
required.
It
occurred
so
many
times
and
with
different
students
that
I
began
to
wonder
whether
what
I
had
learned
about
those
two
and
their
usage
were
wrong
or
perhaps
had
changed
over
the
years
without
my
knowledge.
Each
time
I
came
across
the
wrong
usage
of
the
two
words,
I
found
myself
getting
progressively
troubled.
It
was
easy
to
correct
them
the
first
few
times
but
with
the
passage
of
time
and
as
more
people
kept
making
the
same
mistake,
I
found
myself
a
little
hesitant
to
correct
them.
I
started
questioning
myself
on
the
issue.
I
had
to
finally
ask
WA
colleagues
and
take
a
look
into
the
dictionary
to
set
my
mind
at
rest
that
what
I
was
advocating
was
indeed
correct.
I
have
thought
about
how
these
two
words
could
be
confusing
and
have
decided
that
perhaps
that
problems
stems
from
the
phonetics
of
the
words.
Personally,
I
find
it
strange
that
people
will
find
difficulty
in
the
use
of
these
two
words
since
I
do
not
remember
ever
having
problems
with
their
usage.
Perhaps
there
is
more
to
the
confused
use
than
just
phonetics
and
I
am
definitely
interested
in
finding
that
out.
My
experience
this
past
year
with
writing
has
further
corroborated
for
me
that
writing
is
more
than
just
words
on
a
sheet.
In
truth,
I
found
it
to
be
a
two-way
interaction
that
allows
the
writer
to
enter
a
negotiation
where
an
adherence
to
important
lessons
results
in
a
successful
piece
of
work.
For
me,
I
had
to
learn
to
have
the
correct
attitude
to
achieve
an
identity
in
reports
that
helped
me
to
complete
report
pieces
that
I
could
own
as
mine.
