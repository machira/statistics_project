Literacy
Narrative
As
a
student,
writing
has
proven
to
be
one
of
the
most
difficult,
but
also
most
worthwhile
aspects
of
my
education.
As
an
English
major
concentrating
in
writing,
I
have
an
enormous
appreciation
for
the
steps
I
have
taken
in
school
to
improve
my
abilities
as
a
writer
and
to
increase
my
interest
in
the
subject.
Looking
back
at
the
struggles
I
faced
along
the
way,
however,
I
am
reminded
that
I
did
not
always
enjoy
writing
and
that
it
took
the
help
of
others
and
an
enormous
amount
of
effort
to
shape
me
into
a
decent
writer.
Throughout
all
the
difficulties,
though,
I
am
glad
to
be
able
to
enjoy
writing
as
much
as
I
do
now
and
to
look
forward
to
each
of
my
writing
classes.
To
this
day,
I
have
vivid
memories
of
sitting
at
the
dining
room
table
as
a
five-
or
six-year-old
and
scribbling
down
letters
of
the
alphabet
on
thickly
lined
paper.
At
the
time,
the
letters
being
learned
were
simply
sort
of
an
art
project.
It
was
fun
to
learn
that
a
letter
could
look
two
different
ways,
depending
on
if
it
was
capitalized,
and
that
eventually
I
would
be
able
to
write
out
words
with
these
letters.
Little
did
I
know,
however,
that
completing
words
and
then
sentences
would
be
a
much
less
exciting
lesson.
As
a
twenty-year-old
in
college,
I
still
remember
throwing
hissy
fits
when
my
mom
sat
me
down
and
made
me
spell
out
sentences
as
simple
as
Nthe
dog
sat
on
the
rug.O
The
way
the
letters
came
together
to
form
words
never
made
sense
to
me
and
resulted
in
fits
of
frustration.
Writing
was
an
immediate
struggle
for
me,
and
remained
that
way
long
into
my
childhood.
Though
I
never
enjoyed
writing
in
grammar
school,
I
had
gotten
away
with
writing
poorly
until
my
fifth
grade
English
class
with
a
teacher
I
will
always
remember:
Mr.
Kinnaird.
Unlike
my
third
and
fourth
grade
teachers
who
never
had
the
heart
to
tell
a
little
girl
that
she
was
spelling
words
and
using
grammar
incorrectly,
Mr.
Kinnaird
was
blunt
and
seemingly
impatient.
I
could
always
count
on
having
my
papers
returned
with
red
marker
scribbled
all
over
each
page
and
a
big
Ncheck
minusO
at
the
top.
Each
time
I
received
one
of
my
corrected
papers,
I
tucked
it
away
in
my
backpack
immediately
to
avoid
being
teased
by
my
peers
peeking
over
each
others
shoulders
to
see
who
got
what
grade
on
each
assignment.
As
the
school
year
went
on
and
I
continued
getting
low
scores,
Mr.
Kinnaird
finally
added
a
Nsee
meO
to
one
of
my
papers,
indicating
that
I
had
to
stay
after
school
to
meet
with
him.
When
the
bell
rang
and
the
time
had
come
for
me
to
step
into
his
office,
I
was
terrifiedE
and
with
reason.
Mr.
Kinnaird
demanded
that
I
pull
out
the
collection
of
Ncheck
minusO
papers
I
had
hidden
in
my
backpack
and
lay
them
out
on
his
desk.
With
the
crumpled
papers
stacked
on
his
desk,
he
then
looked
at
me
and
said,
simply,
that
he
had
called
my
mom
earlier
in
the
afternoon,
and
she
had
given
him
permission
to
keep
me
at
school
until
I
finished
correcting
my
papers.
As
furious
as
I
was
at
that
moment,
I
was
also
too
afraid
of
Mr.
Kinnaird
to
do
differently.
I
sat
down
next
to
him,
and
went
from
one
red
scribble
to
the
next
until
I
had
corrected
each
error.
With
the
rest
of
fifth
grade
in
Mr.
KinnairdOs
class
(and
his
apparent
alliance
with
my
mother)
I
never
handed
in
a
paper
until
I
had
gone
over
it
first
with
the
teacher.
My
grades
moved
quickly
from
Ncheck
minusesO
to
Ncheck
plusesO
and
resulted
in
my
increasing
appreciation
for
writing.
I
learned
not
only
that
I
needed
to
be
more
accurate
with
my
spelling
and
grammar,
but
also
that
I
had
to
have
a
stronger
organizational
structure
to
my
papers
in
order
for
them
to
be
easy
to
read.
Though
these
tutoring
sessions
were
extremely
stressful
and
annoying
at
the
time,
my
improvement
in
writing
served
me
well
for
years
to
come.
To
this
day,
I
am
convinced
that
Mr.
Kinnaird
is
almost
completely
responsible
for
my
interests
in
writing.
With
the
improved
technique
I
gained
from
my
fifth
grade
English
class,
I
entered
junior
high
and
high
school
with
the
ability
to
get
AOs
on
almost
every
paper.
In
fact,
I
regularly
received
praise
from
teachers
regarding
the
nearly
perfect
grammar
and
organization
found
in
my
papers.
I
found
myself
looking
forward
to
receiving
graded
writing
assignments
with
the
expectation
that
I
would
have
gotten
an
A
along
with
additional
compliments.
All
of
the
sudden,
writing
was
easy
and
I
was
successful
in
doing
it.
Perhaps
one
reason
why
I
was
so
successful
in
my
high
school
English
classes
is
that
the
writing
style
used
followed
a
very
specific
structure.
I
was
given
assignments
where
I
had
to
come
up
with
three
main
points,
and
support
these
points
within
the
paragraph.
It
was
a
simple
formula,
not
unlike
a
math
problem,
that
I
had
mastered
before
even
getting
into
high
school
and
so
I
was
fortunate
to
do
well
in
that
environment.
Furthermore,
I
was
never
given
an
assignment
that
required
very
much
depth
or
critical
thinking.
I
simply
read
something,
wrote
about
it,
and
turned
it
in
for
a
grade.
Though
I
was
getting
good
grades
and
doing
well
as
a
writer
in
high
school,
I
still
did
not
feel
confident
that
I
would
be
successful
in
college
as
well.
In
my
first
college
English
classes,
I
was
extremely
uncomfortable
with
the
amount
of
informal
writing
we
did
in
our
notebooks
during
class.
From
my
years
in
high
school,
I
was
programmed
to
be
as
critical
as
possible
when
writing
my
papers
and
did
all
my
writing
on
the
computer
where
everything
looked
neat
and
orderly.
Thus,
when
college
professors
often
asked
me
to
write
for
a
few
minutes
each
day
in
pen,
I
felt
awkward
writing
without
any
specific
structure
and
my
poor
handwriting.
Having
to
do
this
almost
every
day
for
a
year,
however,
I
quickly
came
over
this
discomfort
and
learned
to
be
more
carefree
with
my
writing
in
such
situations.
Besides
the
discomfort
I
found
in
having
to
write
more
creatively
and
informally,
I
was
actually
doing
quite
well
as
a
writer
in
college.
However,
I
was
working
much
harder
and
overcoming
much
greater
difficulties
to
achieve
these
grads
than
I
had
in
high
school.
I
found
that
even
with
a
solid
base
in
writing
that
I
had
acquired
in
high
school,
good
grades
were
not
coming
as
easily
in
college
and
I
had
to
be
extremely
sharp
with
my
papers.
It
was
not
until
my
second
year
at
Lafayette
College
in
my
Literary
Questions
class
that
I
felt
confident
enough
in
my
writing
to
stray
from
the
strict
form
I
had
been
taught
in
Mr.
KinnairdOs
class
and
high
school
in
order
to
be
more
creative.
Unlike
teachers
in
high
school,
my
professor
for
this
class
was
interested
primarily
in
my
writingOs
depth
and
creativity.
On
the
first
few
writing
assignments
that
were
graded
in
that
class,
I
remember
my
teacher
asking
me
to
comment
more
on
my
own
opinions
about
the
writing
topic,
rather
than
a
shallow
explanation.
Thus,
I
started
to
write
in
a
style
that
was
more
in
sync
with
my
though
process
rather
than
the
five-paragraph
essay
I
had
been
taught
in
high
school.
The
challenge
at
this
stage
in
my
growth
as
a
writer
was
to
find
a
way
to
combine
the
technical
abilities
I
had
acquired
in
high
school
with
the
creativity
I
was
trying
to
achieve
in
college.
Though
facing
this
difficulty
was
frustrating
at
times,
it
sparked
my
interest
in
writing
so
much
that
I
decided
to
become
an
English
major
concentrating
in
writing.
As
I
developed
as
a
writer
in
college,
I
found
myself
disliking
the
strict
forms
of
writing
that
I
was
used
to
in
high
school.
In
my
psychology
lab,
for
example,
the
writing
was
always
supposed
to
follow
a
very
specific
format
and
be
written
as
concisely
as
possible.
Though
in
high
school
I
would
have
found
such
a
paper
to
be
the
perfect
way
to
get
an
A,
I
was
bored
by
that
sort
of
writing
assignment
in
college
after
I
had
been
exposed
to
a
more
creative
style.
Thus,
my
favorite
writing
assignments
tend
to
be
those
that
combine
research
with
creativity.
To
the
surprise
of
my
peers,
I
can
admit
that
my
favorite
writing
assignment
are
research
papers
in
which
I
collect
information
that
I
have
found
and
reflect
on
in
using
my
own
opinions.
I
feel
that
in
this
writing
situation
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
freedom
as
I
can
reflect
on
the
information
in
any
way
that
I
choose.
To
me,
digging
through
the
library
for
books
about
a
given
subject
and
then
combining
the
information
found
into
one
paper
is
the
most
exciting
aspect
of
my
classes.
As
much
as
I
have
learned
to
love
creative
writing
in
college,
I
find
the
project
of
combining
creativity
with
research
to
be
even
more
exciting.
When
reading
the
papers
I
have
read
throughout
college,
in
fact,
I
can
see
that
as
I
began
to
include
my
own
reflections
and
creativity
when
writing
papers,
the
papers
became
much
more
interesting
to
read.
In
this
way,
I
am
more
often
pleased
with
my
writing
now
than
I
was
before
and
care
more
about
the
writing
process
than
I
do
about
the
actual
letter
grade
I
receive
at
the
end.
In
reflection
of
my
writing
overall
in
college,
I
feel
that
I
have
improved
in
both
the
clarity
of
my
writing
and
the
creativeness.
In
even
the
most
boring
and
tedious
writing
assignments,
I
like
to
think
that
it
is
also
a
good
opportunity
to
practice
making
a
typically
uninteresting
topic
seem
interesting
and
to
carry
a
voice
through
each
paper.
As
a
Writing
Associate
at
Lafayette,
it
will
be
important
for
me
to
help
others
with
problems
that
I
have
had
as
well
in
writing,
and
hopefully
to
help
produce
a
better
paper.
