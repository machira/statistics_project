A
Chronological
History
of
My
Writing
Experiences
I
vividly
remember
sitting
in
my
second
grade
classroom
awkwardly
clenching
that
oversized
red
pencil
desperately
trying
to
imitate
those
perfect
cursive
letters
displayed
on
the
classroom
border.
No
matter
how
hard
I
concentrated
or
how
long
I
tried,
I
never
could
get
my
letters
to
look
quite
right.
I
was
very
frustrated
by
this
initial
writing
experience
and
was
frightened
by
writing
during
grade
school.
Fortunately,
my
later
experiences
with
writing
were
increasingly
positive
and
I
eventually
learned
that
writing
was
not
some
bizarre
form
of
punishment.
Young
Authors
was
one
of
those
projects
that
helped
me
realize
that
writing
could
possibly
result
in
something
positive
and
rewarding.
Each
year,
from
second
grade
until
sixth,
every
student
was
required
to
write
a
fiction
or
non-fiction
story
about
a
subject
of
his
or
her
choice.
We
had
to
write,
illustrate,
and
bind
our
own
books
(with
the
assistance
of
our
teacher
and
eager
Class
Moms,
of
course).
Writing
my
first
book,
How
I
got
My
Dog,
was
fun
and
an
extremely
imaginative
experience,
yet
I
didn't
feel
a
real
sense
of
ownership
over
the
finished
product.
Although
I
drew
all
twelve
pictures
of
Tippy
(I
just
couldn't
seem
to
get
enough
of
drawing
her),
my
teacher
transcribed
the
story
for
me,
and
the
classroom
Moms
bound
it.
It
wasn't
until
the
sixth
grade
that
I
finally
felt
that
my
book
was
truly
my
book.
For
my
last
Young
Authors
project,
I
decided
to
write
a
fantastic
creative
story
about
time
travel,
foreign
lands,
rainbows,
and
unicorns.
I
really
got
involved
in
the
story.
I
thought
about
my
characters
all
the
time,
I
took
it
upon
myself
to
do
research
on
the
cities
I
was
writing
about
and
I
did
all
the
work
that
was
involved
with
binding
the
book.
By
the
end,
I
thought
that
this
magnum
opus
should
not
only
be
published,
but
should
be
required
reading
for
all
eleven
year
olds.
I
realized
how
rewarding
writing
could
be
and
that
it
truly
was
an
insightful
expression
of
the
creator.
My
affinity
for
creative
writing
was
short-lived,
however.
I
always
preferred
writing
about
things
from
personal
experience
or
about
an
assigned
subject
or
question.
I'm
not
sure
exactly
why,
but
I
think
it's
because
I
was
(and
still
am)
very
self-conscious
about
my
creative
writing.
I
would
have
much
rather
had
someone
read
a
story
about
how
I
wore
a
pair
of
Wonder
Woman
Underoos
to
school
as
my
Halloween
costume,
than
a
book
of
my
original
poetry.
When
I
wrote
creatively,
I
felt
so
exposed
and
vulnerable-like
my
soul
was
sitting
right
there
on
an
open
page
for
anyone
to
ridicule
or
criticize.
When
I
reached
the
seventh
grade,
I
had
one
of
those
outstanding
teachers
that
everyone
remembers
forever
who
helped
me
get
over
my
fears
of
writing
creatively
a
bit.
Mr.
Ferraro
was
so
enthusiastic
about
English
and
so
zany
in
his
approaches
to
teaching
writing
that
it
was
hard
not
to
feel
comfortable
opening
up
in
his
classroom.
He
strongly
encouraged
his
students
to
take
risks
in
their
writing
assignments
and
openly
rewarded
and
cajoled
worthy
students.
Everyone
wanted
him
to
approve
of
his
or
her
work,
so
we
all
tried
desperately
(and
very
often
succeeded)
to
be
innovative
and
entertaining.
In
high
school,
I
did
less
and
less
creative
writing
and
I
quickly
began
to
fear
it
again.
Since
I've
been
at
Lafayette,
I
can't
remember
ever
being
required
to
write
creatively
(meaning,
I've
never
been
assigned
to
write,
for
example,
a
poem
or
a
fictional
story).
Of
course,
this
is
by
choice
and
not
something
I
regret.
I've
had
plenty
of
opportunities
to
develop
and
demonstrate
my
creative
skills
in
both
high
school
and
college,
but
I've
chosen
not
to
take
them.
It
goes
back
to
that
fear
that
I
mentioned
previously
about
having
my
soul
openly
exposed
on
paper
lying
there
for
any
heartless
person
to
rip
it
to
shreds.
Mr.
Ferraro's
encouragement
to
write
uninhibitedly
may
not
have
had
that
life-long
effect
on
me
that
he
was
possibly
hoping
for,
but
he
did
teach
me
some
fundamental
rules
of
grammar
that
have
stuck
with
me
through
the
years.
Mr.
Ferraro
had
this
ability
to
make
something
so
dull,
like
direct
and
indirect
objects,
surprisingly
interesting.
He
was
able
to
make
those
senseless
rules
so
logical.
I
still
remember
being
a
bridesmaid
at
the
wedding
of
Mr.
Direct
Object
and
Mrs.
Indirect
Object
and
that
song
we
learned
to
help
us
remember
all
the
prepositions.
His
effective
teaching
methods
provided
me
with
the
essential
tools
to
go
on
to
high
school
and
write
logical,
correct
papers.
I
thank
him
for
providing
me
with
a
solid
base
on
which
I
was
able
to
build
my
writing
skills.
My
next
English
teacher
was
also
a
great
influence
on
my
literary
life.
I
probably
had
many
formative
writing
experiences
in
that
class,
unfortunately
I
can
only
recall
one.
Mrs.
Gray
required
all
her
students
to
keep
a
daily
journal.
Sometimes
she
would
assign
a
topic,
but
most
of
the
time
it
was
up
to
us
to
decide
what
and
how
long
to
write.
I
must
admit
that
I
wasn't
completely
faithful
about
writing
in
my
journal
every
night,
but
I
did
do
the
required
number
of
entries
and
I
enjoyed
writing
in
it.
It
was
like
a
new
best
friend
that
couldn't
open
her
mouth
even
if
she
wanted
to.
I
confided
in
it,
speculated
in
it,
dreamed
in
it,
cried
to
it,
and
complained
in
it.
Mrs.
Gray
said
we
were
going
to
get
annoyed
keeping
our
journals,
but
eventually
they
would
become
something
so
rare
and
special
that
we'd
treasure
them
forever.
She,
of
course,
was
exactly
right.
My
journal
was
something
I
really
grew
to
love,
and
journal
writing
is
a
habit
that
I
continue
to
practice
today.
Although
journal
writing
is
a
habit
I
still
maintain,
the
purpose,
frequency,
and
format
of
my
writing
has
changed
significantly
over
the
years.
When
I
first
started
keeping
a
journal,
my
entries
were
relatively
short
and
numerous.
I
usually
wrote
about
the
primary
concerns
of
most
thirteen
year
old
girls--boys,
complaining
about
what
was
wrong
with
me,
boys,
friends,
and
more
boys.
My
journal
writing
during
my
first
few
years
in
high
school
continued
to
be
somewhat
superficial,
featuring
mainly
just
descriptions
of
major
events
in
my
high
school
years.
I
described
everything
as
cool,
awesome,
or
kinda
lame.
I
began
exploring
my
emotions
and
thoughts
more
deeply
in
writing
about
situations
or
people
that
were
troubling
me,
subjects
of
anxiety,
and
sometimes
things
that
elated
me,
however
these
entries
were
few
and
far
between.
In
the
last
four
or
five
years,
my
journal
writing
has
slowed
down
dramatically.
I
have
a
hard
time
finding
enough
time
and
a
conducive
spot
for
writing.
Also,
I
rarely
feel
motivated
to
recapitulate
a
trip
that
I've
taken
or
a
special
event
that
has
recently
passed.
The
only
time
I
find
myself
pulling
out
my
journal
recently,
is
when
I
need
to
sort
through
my
feelings
and
thoughts
when
I'm
severely
perplexed
and
distraught.
My
most
recent
entries
have
taken
on
a
sort
of
stream
of
consciousness
quality
they
are
extremely
lengthy.
I've
found
journals
to
be
therapeutic
and
an
effective
way
of
solving
problems
and
sorting
emotions.
From
the
fifth
to
the
eighth
grades,
I
was
placed
in
the
higher
English
classes.
Hence,
by
the
time
I
reached
high
school,
I
felt
well
prepared
for
the
demands
of
my
teachers.
My
freshman
English
teacher
was
extremely
demanding
and
very
effective.
We
were
the
only
class
from
our
year
that
was
required
to
write
a
six
page
research
paper.
I
think
back
to
that
assignment
and
I
have
difficulty
imagining
that
I
thought
that
such
a
task
was
so
hard
and
frightening--it
just
seems
like
such
a
simple
assignment
now.
However,
as
a
fourteen
year
old
who
had
no
idea
how
to
use
a
library
for
research
and
had
never
written
more
than
three
pages,
a
typed
six
page
literary
criticism
paper
was
extremely
intimidating.
Mrs.
Overby
took
us
step
by
step
through
the
two
month
process
(!),
checking
our
outlines,
thesis's,
note
cards,
bibliographies,
and
drafts
every
few
days.
At
first
I
was
repulsed
by
the
idea
of
writing
a
research
paper,
but
once
I
got
into
writing
my
paper
on
Charlotte
Bronte's
Jane
Eyre,
I
loved
it.
It
was
like
putting
together
a
puzzle.
I
pictured
the
project
as
an
empty
circle
with
my
thesis
at
the
center
and
it
was
my
job
to
search
through
all
my
available
resources
to
make
this
circle
complete.
I
did
well
on
that
first
paper,
and
while
I
wouldn't
necessarily
choose
to
write
a
research
paper
during
my
summer
vacation,
I
knew
I
could
right
one
and
that
it
wasn't
that
awful
of
a
project.
After
my
freshman
and
sophomore
years,
I
was
feeling
pretty
good
about
myself
as
a
writer.
I
was
getting
good
grades,
I
didn't
mind
writing,
and
I
thought
I
was
pretty
good
at
it.
My
parents
thought
I
was
going
to
be
the
next
Maya
Angelou
or
something--they
were
very
impressed
with
my
writing
to
say
the
least.
I
think,
however,
my
parents'
confidence
in
my
writing
ability
stemmed
from
my
two
older
brothers'
lack
of
it
(or,
I
should
say,
their
refusal
to
demonstrate
it).
Needless
to
say
,
I
was
feeling
close
to
invincible
going
into
my
junior
year.
That
quickly
changed.
I
took
two
classes
my
junior
year
that
involved
a
large
amount
of
writing.
My
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Wright,
was
very
tough
and
critical.
Although
I
never
received
anything
lower
than
a
B-
or
a
C+,
I
never
could
get
above
a
B+
which
was
extremely
frustrating
for
me.
She
taught
me
a
lot
of
things
though
that
I
still
adhere
to
today,
like
starting
a
paper
with
an
interesting
introduction
which
includes
a
quote
or
anecdote.
She
always
included
insightful
comments
and
probing
questions
with
my
graded
essays.
I
found
her
to
be
challenging
and
I
think
my
writing
definitely
improved
that
year.
I
became
more
critical
of
my
own
writing,
a
better
proof
reader,
and
more
adventurous
in
my
papers.
The
other
writing-intensive
class
I
had
my
junior
year
was
a
modern
US
history
course.
We
were
required
to
write
four
six
to
eight
page
papers
over
the
course
of
the
year.
My
teacher,
Mr.
Bryer,
was
one
of
those
arrogant,
sarcastic,
I'm
so
cool
types.
I
liked
him
most
of
the
time
but
I
thought
he
often
said
things
in
class
to
students
which
were
completely
inappropriate.
For
instance,
while
he
was
handing
back
our
first
paper,
he
made
a
few
general
comments
about
the
class's
work,
what
he
liked,
what
he
didn't
like,
and
so
forth.
Then
he
announced
to
all
twenty
some
odd
students
that
the
person
who
received
the
highest
grade
on
the
paper
was
not
only
a
girl,
but
also
a
blond!
and
then
handed
me
my
paper.
I
had
mixed
feelings
at
that
point--I
was
extremely
proud
of
my
work,
but
at
the
same
time
I
was
mortified.
From
that
point
on,
I
felt
like
I
had
something
to
prove
to
both
my
male-chauvinist
teacher
and
my
skeptical
classmates.
So,
when
Mr.
Bryer
offered
us
the
opportunity
to
do
a
project
instead
of
two-six
page
papers,
I
rose
to
the
challenge.
I,
along
with
four
other
brave
souls,
opted
to
write
a
twelve
page
minimum
paper
on
Governor
Florio's
new
tax
plan
and
its
positive
or
negative
effect
on
New
Jersey's
education
system.
Two
papers
would
be
chosen
from
the
junior
and
senior
classes
to
represent
Holmdel
High
School
in
a
state-wide
competition.
I
decided
to
go
ahead
and
write
the
longer
paper
because
it
would
be
a
good
chance
to
get
some
experience
doing
research
and
writing
a
longer
paper,
I
would
only
have
one
more
paper
to
write
after
that,
and
I
would
have
a
chance
to
prove
myself
to
M
r.
Bryer.
It
may
have
been
the
stupidest
thing
a
sixteen
year
old
could
have
done.
This
paper
remains,
to
this
day,
the
hardest
thing
I've
ever
done
academically.
This
project
entailed
attaining
and
deciphering
primary
sources
from
offices
of
the
governor
and
other
relevant
states
people.
I
had
to
read
the
Quality
Education
Act
and
all
material
related
to
it,
in
addition
to
any
periodical
or
journal
articles
before
I
could
even
begin
to
comprehend
the
topic.
This
paper
was
a
full
time
deal.
All
of
my
other
worked
suffered.
I
talked
to
county
administrators,
town
council
people,
reporters,
board
of
education
members,
and
teachers,
among
other
people
in
order
to
gather
information
for
this
paper
and
formulate
an
argument.
This
was
the
first
time
I
had
written
a
strictly
argumentative
paper
and
I
didn't
like
it
at
all.
When
I
finally
gathered
all
my
information,
understood
to
some
extent
the
topic,
and
developed
an
argument,
I
had
to
actually
write
the
paper
(which
turned
out
to
be
the
easiest
part
of
the
process,
although
it
was
still
very
difficult).
My
father
helped
me
a
great
deal
helping
me
organize
my
thoughts
and
proof
reading
and
commenting
on
my
writing.
He
stayed
up
with
me
late
into
the
night
a
few
nights
before
it
was
due,
and
then
finally,
a
month
and
a
half
later,
my
fourteen
and
a
half
pages
were
ready
to
be
handed
in.
I
wasn't
chosen
to
represent
our
school
in
the
contest,
but
I,
along
with
all
the
students
who
wrote
that
paper,
did
very
well.
I
was
relieved
at
the
end
that
it
was
over,
and
I
was
proud
of
myself
for
pulling
it
off,
but
I
still
would
never
do
it
again.
One
positive
thing
that
came
from
writing
that
paper
from
Hell
was
that
I
felt
more
than
adequately
prepared
for
Lafayette
when
I
arrived
in
the
fall
of
1992.
I
was
overwhelmed
by
the
amount
of
writing
required
in
all
of
my
classes,
but
I
adjusted
quickly.
No
longer
was
writing
limited
to
only
English
classes
and
occasionally
a
history
course--first
semester
of
my
freshman
year,
I
had
to
write
at
least
one
paper
for
each
of
my
courses
except
calculus.
I
had
one
to
two
page
French
compositions
due
weekly,
a
fifteen
page
term
paper
for
government,
several
writing
assignments
for
psychology,
and
then
there
was
my
First-Year
Seminar.
That
was
a
considerable
amount
for
a
recent
high
school
graduate.
Coming
out
of
Holmdel
High
School,
I
felt
like
I
had
a
strong
writing
background
and
was
equipped
with
the
tools
to
survive
my
writing
courses.
Had
I
not
had
these
tools,
I
think
I
would
have
been
at
a
lost.
Thus,
when
I
arrived
at
Lafayette,
I
could
write
a
basic,
no-frills,
formulaic
essay.
My
FYS
and
English
110
really
helped
me
develop
my
style
as
a
writer.
During
my
FYS,
I
began
to
more
clearly
understand
the
purpose
of
writing--it
wasn't
merely
an
exercise.
Our
first
assignment
was
to
write
a
paper
comparing
two
advertisements
and
analyzing
what
messages
were
being
conveyed.
My
professor
was
able
to
help
me
understand
the
importance
of
being
specific
and
rooted
in
the
material
I
was
dealing
with.
For
the
first
time,
I
understood
what
writing
was
for.
I
was
trying
to
make
someone
else
see
and
understand
the
same
things
I
did
in
those
advertisements.
Although
writing
became
more
time
consuming
with
these
new
tips,
I
was
infinitely
more
pleased
with
the
results.
The
following
semester,
I
took
English
110.
That
course
was
also
fundamental
in
forming
my
style
as
a
writer.
I
learned
the
value
of
revisions,
of
writing
from
different
perspectives,
and
of
being
thorough,
yet
concise.
That
semester,
I
applied
to
be
a
writing
associate.
And
well,
here
I
am.
Being
a
writing
associate
has
helped
me
a
great,
great
deal.
I've
become
a
lot
more
critical
of
my
own
writing
and
it
has
become
increasingly
deliberate.
Before,
I
resented
criticism
a
bit,
but
now
I
see
it
as
essential
and
I
welcome
it
openly.
My
grammar
has
improved
from
referring
students
to
the
St.
Martin's
Handbook,
and
I
feel
I've
become
a
more
effective
communicator.
I
thank
the
Writing
Program
at
Lafayette
for
this
opportunity
and
it
has
played
a
large
role
in
my
experiences
in
college.
