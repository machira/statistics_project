Writing
Narrative
8/28/95
I
never
thought
of
myself
as
a
good
writer.
At
this
point,
I
think
of
myself
as
an
experiecned
writer,
not
a
good
writer.
When
I
was
younger,
my
writing
skills
were
so
bad
that
many
of
my
grade
school
and
especially
junior
high
teachers
thought
that
I
might
have
a
learning
disability.
I
never
believed
that
for
a
second.
I
knew
that
the
real
reason
my
writing
was
bad
was
because
I
was
disinterested
in
the
subject
matter
almost
every
time.
I
was
often
unable
to
write
two
pages
on
given
subject
because
my
writing
was
so
concise.
I
was
especially
bad
at
writing
for
history
class.
I
remember
very
well
after
recieving
a
low
grade
on
an
essay
test
my
teacher
commenting
that
I
failed
to
explain
the
significance
of
historical
events.
I
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
said,
What
do
you
mean
significance?
It
happened--That's
its
only
significance
to
me.
I
think
that
I
took
history
for
granted
taking
an
attitude
expressed
in
this
kind
of
thinking
If
it
hadn't
happened
the
way
that
it
did,
it
would
have
happened
some
other
way,
but,
as
far
as
we
know,
it
didn't.
So,
so
what?
Also
I
was
skeptical
of
validity
of
history.
Much
of
history
seemed
to
be
just
story.
I
never
believed
in
the
infalibility
of
either
my
teachers
or
my
textbooks.
The
few
times
that
I
produced
good
work
were
the
few
times
that
I
found
the
project
genuinely
interesting.
The
first
successful
writing
project
that
I
had
(successful
in
the
sense
that
I
thought
it
was
good
and
enjoyed
writing
it
at
the
time)
was
a
short
story
that
I
wrote
in
grade
school
about
mice
who
lived
in
the
supporting
structure
of
a
roller
coaster
and
befriend
the
local
birds.
The
story,
in
its
final
copy,
was
five
handwritten
pages
(complete
with
illustrations);
it
was
seven
handwritten
pages
in
its
rough
draft
from,
but
the
tediousness
of
recopying
the
entire
story
by
hand
caused
my
to
edit
out
about
two
pages
of
plot
twists
and
details.
Stories
were
more
often
good
writing
projects
than
essays
for
me
when
I
was
a
kid.
I
had
imagination
and
ideas
that
I
could
put
into
stories
easily.
I
remember
one
very
involved
story
that
I
never
wrote
down
but
told
to
my
friends
walking
home
from
school
during
the
winter.
The
entire
story
revolved
around
a
pile
of
snow
in
the
schoolyard.
The
snowplows
would
push
all
of
the
snow
from
the
parking
lot,
the
field
and
the
playground
all
into
a
single
pile
that
was
as
high
as
eight
feet
tall
some
winters.
We
weren't
aloud
to
play
on
the
monstrous
pile
of
snow,
but
we
always
did
anyway.
A
wave
of
kids
determined
to
have
fun
just
can't
be
stopped.
This
tremendous
snow-pile
and
hours
of
play
on
it
(we
would
get
up
extra
early
in
the
morning
to
climb
on
this
thing)
combined
with
the
conflict
of
authority
figures
telling
us
not
to
always
made
for
great
stories.
My
friends
were
also
great
story-tellers.
The
game
we
usually
play
was
the
favorite
game
from
first
to
fith
grade.
In
this
game
we
would
invent
characters,
complete
with
personal
histories
and
then
act
out
and
invent
stories.
In
hindsight
the
interesting
thing
about
this
game
was
it
quickly
fell
into
formula
plots.
In
the
favorite
plot
the
two
characters
meet
as
strangers
then
fight
but
later
resolve
their
differences
and
unite
against
a
greater
enemy.
These
story-telling
experiences
form
my
writing
experiences
more
than
any
school
projects
or
anything
else
that
I
was
involved
in
at
the
time.
In
the
seventh
grade
I
used
these
story-telling
techniques
to
write
a
short
autobiographical
story.
The
twist
that
made
it
successful
was
using
an
imitation
style.
I
imitated
Holden
Caufield's
diction
and
speech
pattern
from
J.D.
Salinger's
The
Catcher
in
the
Rye
which
I
was
reading
at
the
time.
(I
also
got
a
chance
to
write
an
imitation
of
a
Hemingway
story
two
years
ago
at
Lafayette.)
I
liked
this
project
and
remember
doing
well
on
it.
My
younger
sisters
both
went
to
the
same
middle
school
and
had
the
same
english
teacher
three
and
six
years
later
and
told
me
that
the
teacher
had
read
my
paper
to
their
classes--funny
stuff.
I
don't
think
that
I
wrote
anything
else
that
was
worth
even
a
grain
of
salt
for
several
years.
It
was
in
middle
school
that
I
had
a
hard
time
learning
to
write
essays.
Actuality
anything
that
was
not
in
the
form
of
a
story,
I
couldn't
write.
Not
even
the
four
sentence
identifications
that
my
history
teacher
asked
me
to
write.
I
was
asked
to
write
many
essays
and
remember
being
miserable
every
time.
I
would
say
things
like
essays
are
like
excuses.
I
eventually
learned
how
to
plod
my
way
through
the
standard
five
paragraph
essay
and
how
to
set
it
up
quickly.
I
could
find
a
thesis,
three
topics
to
support
and
then
conclude
that
I
was
right
all
along
pretty
easily.
The
writing
still
stunk
because
the
topics
were
still
boring
and
I
never
had
anything
more
to
say
in
the
essay
itself
than
in
the
quick
outline
that
I
jotted
down
(an
outline
was
a
good
tactic
to
get
a
handle
on
things).
The
outline
and
the
essay
were
basically
both
the
same.
I
had
a
bear
of
a
time
trying
to
meet
length
requirements
when
I
knew
that
I
said
all
that
I
was
going
to
say
in
the
first
paragraph.
I
would
write
the
same
sentences
about
three
different
ways
and
in
three
different
places
in
the
paper.
Boring
as
hell.
In
high
school
there
was
even
a
test
on
how
well
we
could
do
just
this.
We
were
all
given
the
same
topic
and
forty-five
minutes
with
a
pencil
and
paper
to
write
an
essay
on
it.
I
wrote
a
terrible
and
inane
essay
and
remember
it
being
a
nightmare
trying
to
think
of
things
to
say
or
ways
to
make
the
same
sentences
sound
different.
But
I
got
an
eight
out
of
nine
on
this
paper
because
I
followed
the
five
paragraph
essay
form
that
they
were
trying
to
drill
into
us
at
this
time
and
the
test
was
given
to
every
student
in
a
school
of
two-thousand
so
in
order
to
grade
it
they
had
to
use
every
teacher
including
the
gym
teachers,
the
geography
teachers
and
the
foreign
language
teachers
(many
of
which
didn't
speak
English
all
that
well).
This
was
a
terrible
experience
for
me.
To
write
a
crappy
essay
and
hve
it
recieve
a
high
mark
just
because
it
followed
a
form
well
was
shocking
to
me.
Fortunately
the
next
year
I
had
a
teacher
who
had
the
same
hatred
for
the
five-paragraph
essay
that
I
did.
His
dislike
of
it
was
probably
even
more
severe
than
mine.
I
could
always
use
it
as
a
crutch
to
get
through
an
exercise,
but
he
had
had
to
read
hundreds
of
bad
essays
written
in
this
incredibly
boring
form.
I
might
have
written
one
good
essay
in
class,
but
probably
not.
The
important
thing
was
that
I
learned
that
I
could
abandon
this
form
and
still
make
my
writing
effective.
That
same
year
I
had
the
experience
of
writing
research
papers
for
the
first
time--including
one
in
medieval
history.
Writing
for
history
classes
has
always
terrified
me,
and
this
assignment
was
a
to
be
a
massive
ten
pages
long.
(At
the
time
a
ten
page
paper
was
TEN
PAGES
LONG!)
So
I
did
something
radically
different
to
write
this
paper:
I
started
early.
This
teacher
was
a
stickler
for
details
and
formal
considerations
were
a
priority.
But
after
numerous
revisions
I
turned
a
decent
paper
on
siege
warfare
with
no
technical
errors.
This
paper
was
not
tremendous
sucess
for
me
but
I
did
learn
to
pay
attention
to
details
by
doing
it.
This
paper
has
taken
a
very
chronological
form
so
I'll
continue
to
the
last
sucessful
writing
project
of
high
school.
In
my
junior
year
we
were
asked
to
write
practice
college
essays.
This
project
was
a
good
one
for
me
because
I
was
able
to
return
to
story-telling.
This
time
I
writing
non-fiction
about
how
I
got
into
swimming
and
the
influence
of
one
my
teammates
who
got
me
started
on
it
helped
me
go
from
being
a
good
swimmer
to
a
really
competitive
swimmer.
Eventually
I
did
use
this
paper
as
my
college
essay,
although
I
did
not
want
my
essay
to
be
about
swimming.
The
real
strength
of
the
paper
was
its
description
of
how
intense
and
ambitious
my
teammate
was
both
in
and
out
of
the
pool
and
how
he
transferred
those
qualities
to
me.
Now
that
I've
covered
almost
all
of
the
good
writing
that
I
did
before
coming
to
college
I
should
write
about
the
past
three
years
in
which
I've
done
more
writing
than
ever
before
in
my
life.
I
don't
remember
thinking
of
myself
as
a
good
writer
freshman
year,
but
I
was
interested
in
the
projects
I
was
working
on.
By
virtue
of
intense
conceptual
analysis
of
the
topics
I
was
able
to
achieve
some
early
sucesses.
These
surprized
me
and
made
think
about
my
writing
more.
I
discovered
that
I
had
all
of
the
technical
skills
that
I
needed
(if
I
took
the
trouble
to
pay
attention
to
details),
and
that
I
had
a
very
good
understanding
of
the
material.
It
didn't
take
me
long
to
decide
to
leave
engineering
and
become
an
English
major
(I
am
also
majoring
in
economics).
I've
learned
a
lot
of
rhetorical
tricks
that
make
my
papers
stronger:
good
transtions,
word
associations,
alternating
short
and
long
sentences.
But
for
the
most
part
I
rely
on
a
good
understanding
of
conceptual
issues
to
write
well.
I
also
work
hard
to
find
projects
that
I
will
be
interested
in
from
start
to
finish.
I
write
crap
when
I'm
bored
with
my
subject.
I'm
not
sure
if
that
is
a
weakness
or
a
defense
mechanism
to
avoid
subjects
that
I'm
interested
in.
