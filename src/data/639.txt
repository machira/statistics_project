Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative
When
I
first
saw
that
the
summer
assignment
for
returning
WAs
was
to
write
about
our
experiences
as
writers
over
the
course
of
the
past
year,
I
immediately
opened
my
literacy
narrative,
Learning
Immersion,
that
I
wrote
for
Professor
FalboOs
Politics
of
Literacy
course
in
the
fall
of
2008.
In
my
narrative
for
Professor
Falbo,
I
did
not
quite
touch
on
my
experiences
working
with
other
students
as
a
WA,
but
the
process
of
actually
looking
over
the
course
of
my
life
and
the
importance
of
reading
and
writing,
and
then
putting
those
thoughts
into
words
(which
turned
into
22
page
document)
certainly
contributes
to
the
way
I
work
as
a
WA.
In
addition
to
looking
back
at
Learning
Immersion
and
the
process
behind
writing
it,
my
semester
abroad
studying
in
Ireland
has
also
greatly
affected
me
as
a
writer.
Day
by
day
I
am
faced
with
texts,
ideas,
and
experiences
that
all
contribute
to
the
way
I
write,
think,
and
workNboth
as
a
WA,
and
a
Lafayette
College
student.
But
then
again,
IOm
not
out
to
write
another
22
pages,
so
the
focus
of
this
narrative
of
the
past
year
of
my
life
is
separated
by
the
past
two
semesters,
and
further
separated
by
my
experiences
as
a
WA,
and
just
as
a
student.
When
I
first
began
working
as
a
WA
in
the
fall
of
2008,
I
was
not
sure
what
to
expect.
Although
I
had
worked
with
WAs
in
my
own
FYS
and
VAST
classes,
I
still
was
unsure
what
to
expect
when
the
roles
of
WA
and
student
were
reversed.
After
initially
meeting
with
Professor
OONeill,
however,
my
nerves
were
calmedNI
knew
I
was
qualified
to
work
with
this
group
of
incoming
freshmen,
and
I
was
more
than
excited.
In
the
beginning
part
of
the
semester
when
I
was
meeting
with
each
of
the
students
in
the
initial
conferences,
I
relied
heavily
on
my
past
experiences
with
my
WAs;
I
asked
similar
questions
my
WAs
had
asked
me.
I
soon
realized
there
was
absolutely
no
formula,
no
set
agenda
for
WA
conferences.
Every
piece
of
writing
the
students
brought
in,
and
every
student
for
that
matter,
had
different
questions
and
concerns,
and
wanted
to
spend
the
30
minutes
with
me
in
different
ways.
That
was
the
exact
point
when
I
really
realized
discussing
writing
is
nonsensical
unless
it
is
completely
focused
on
the
creator,
the
writer.
This
might
not
seem
like
that
great
of
a
revelation
considering
one
of
the
main
things
the
CWP
teaches
is
student-led
conferences
(focusing
on
their
individual
thoughts
and
concerns
about
their
writing),
but
for
me,
it
was.
I
do
not
remember
the
exact
conference
or
even
which
student
I
was
working
with
when
I
came
to
this
realization,
but
I
know
it
occurred
during
the
first
rounds
of
conferences.
From
then
on,
I
made
it
a
point
to
scope
out
concerns
of
the
student
before
anything
else.
After
making
those
establishments,
I
found
the
conferences
much
more
worthwhile,
comfortable,
and
helpful
for
the
students
I
was
working
with.
During
the
latter
part
of
the
fall
semester,
I
was
engulfed
in
writing
and
reworking
Learning
Immersion.
Though
my
narrative
was
broken
up
into
three
separate
chapters:
NGoldbug,O
NCeremonial
Instruction,O
and
NLessons
from
the
Inside,O
the
overall
theme
of
my
narrativeNand
my
life
experiences
as
a
writerNwas,
and
remains,
how
important
my
parents
and
home
environment
have
been
in
shaping
me
as
a
writer.
Within
the
three
chapters
I
explain
(I
think)
rather
convincingly
this
claim,
while
paying
close
attention
to
my
high
school
years
in
which
I
felt
confined
by
NceremonialO
instruction
of
my
education
there.
Towards
the
end
of
my
narrative,
I
spend
several
paragraphs
commenting
on
how
important
the
US
education
system
actually
is.
Reading
over
the
pages
I
wrote
over
six
months
ago,
I
still
agree
with
many
of
the
points
I
made.
But
what
I
am
only
just
realizing
now
is
how
much
writing
that
narrative
affected
my
work
as
a
WA.
At
the
time,
I
think
the
way
I
approached
student
writing
as
a
result
of
working
through
my
own
literacy
narrative
was
subconscious.
Looking
back,
however,
I
really
believe
writing
about
my
evolution
as
a
writer
(and
reader)
forced
me
to
become
a
more
aware
writing
associate.
Because
I
was
abroad
this
past
semester,
memories
from
my
experience
of
being
a
WA
during
the
first
semester
are
not
as
vivid
as
they
once
were.
Nonetheless,
I
have
come
to
several
personal
conclusions.
During
the
time
span
of
writing
my
own
narrative
in
which
I
explain
how
influential
oneOs
home
environment
can
be
to
their
want
and
will
to
become
a
great
reader
and
writer,
I
was
also
spending
two
hours
each
week
volunteering
in
the
Northhampton
County
Prison
in
which
I
led
a
book
group
for
women
inmates.
Naturally,
I
began
comparing
my
own
skills
as
a
reader
and
writer,
my
education,
and
the
major
influences
of
my
family
on
my
development
as
a
literate
person
with
those
of
the
women
in
the
prison.
Towards
the
end
of
my
third
chapter,
NLessons
from
the
Inside,O
I
write:
NWithin
the
walls
of
the
Northampton
County
Prison,
I
was
forced
to
listen
to
women
whose
lives
have
been
torn
apart
by
drugs
and
violence,
broken
families
and
lost
educations.
Some
of
these
women
are
younger
than
me,
and
some
could
be
my
grandmother.
From
listening
to
these
womenOs
comments
made
in
initial
group
discussions,
it
became
clear
to
me
almost
immediately
that
I
was
from
a
completely
different
world
than
them.
Initially,
I
didnOt
believe
I
would
have
all
that
much
in
common
with
these
women,
I
am
not
a
criminal,
after
all,
but
I
had
no
idea
how
extreme
our
literacies
would
differ.
Being
forced
to
witness
such
a
disparity
each
week
single-handedly
made
me
appreciate
my
educationNformal
and
informal,
primary,
secondary,
and
LafayetteNto
the
fullest
degree
possible.
I
still
believe
my
parents
were
most
influential
in
shaping
the
literate
person
I
have
become,
but
now
I
can
see,
and
actually
believe,
just
how
powerful
having
an
education
is
at
every
level.O
Understandably,
the
differences
between
the
students
I
was
working
with
during
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
and
me
were
much
less
extreme
than
the
female
inmates
and
I.
However,
my
experiences
discussing
reading
and
writing
with
the
women
in
the
prison
taught
me
how
different
peopleOs
literacies
really
can
be.
Diversity
is
just
not
something
I
immediately
associate
with
Lafayette
College,
but
by
immersing
myself
into
the
educations
and
literacies
of
the
women
at
Northhampton
County
Prison,
I
was
constantly
reminded
that
the
students
I
was
working
with
in
the
FYS
all
came
from
different
backgrounds.
Some
studentsO
writing
was
more
clear,
interesting,
coherent,
and
developed
than
others,
which
IOm
sure
was
in
part
influenced
by
the
degree
of
rigidity
of
their
past
educations
in
primary
and
secondary
schools.
The
way
the
students
talked
about
their
writingNand
discussed
wanting
to
learn
ways
to
become
stronger
writersNhowever,
revealed
to
me
how
affecting
the
environments
in
which
these
students
were
brought
up
were.
At
any
rate,
working
with
the
women
in
the
prison
was
an
absolutely
eye
opening
experience,
and
at
the
same
time,
it
taught
me
to
be
tolerant
of
peopleOs
literate
backgrounds.
Obviously
all
of
the
students
I
worked
with
first
semester
were
literate
people,
but
having
spent
so
much
time
working
with
people
who
had
trouble
reading
and
could
hardly
write
I
truly
believe
made
me
a
more
sensitive
and
aware
writing
associate.
As
a
WA,
over
the
course
of
the
year
I
have
learned
to
become
more
accepting,
sensitive,
and
generally
responsive
to
peopleOs
different
styles
of
writing,
and
their
learned
literacies
in
general.
Over
the
past
semester,
however,
I
was
exposed
to
the
literature
and
reading
and
writing
practices
to
a
culture
entirely
different
from
Lafayette
College.
I
was
a
student
at
the
National
University
of
Ireland
Galway
from
January
to
May.
One
might
think
that
because
English
is
spoken
in
Ireland,
that
my
experience
as
a
student
writer
would
not
vary
all
that
much
from
Lafayette.
This
is
a
completely
false
assumption.
Between
January
and
May,
I
watched
myself
change,
and
very
consciously
become
a
different
kind
of
writer.
I
am
unsure
where
or
how
the
changes
I
underwent
as
a
writer
in
Ireland
will
affect
my
continuing
education
at
Lafayette,
nor
can
I
foresee
how
those
changes
will
affect
me
as
a
writing
associate,
but
I
am
willing
to
bet,
and
am
looking
forward
to
finding
out
for
myself,
that
the
changes
(and
the
reason
for
those
changes)
will
be
influential
in
some
way
to
me
as
a
writer.
I
took
six
courses
in
Ireland,
2
English
courses,
2
History
courses,
European
WomenOs
Studies
and
Celtic
Studies.
The
way
classes
are
run
in
Ireland
are
completely
different
from
the
States,
and
strikingly
contrasting
to
the
courses
at
Lafayette.
For
one
thing,
all
of
my
classes
were
huge.
My
professors
had
no
idea
who
I
was,
and
there
was
absolutely
no
asking
of
questions
or
class
discussionNmy
classes
were
strictly
lectures.
When
I
found
out
most
of
my
courses
were
to
be
evaluated
based
on
responses
to
essay
questions,
I
thought
Nperfect!O
I
enjoy
writing
papers,
certainly
prefer
them
to
exams,
and
consider
myself
a
strong
writer.
Well,
writing
the
papers
for
my
courses
in
Ireland
was
not
all
I
had
cracked
it
up
to
be.
Generally,
for
my
courses
at
Lafayette,
I
find
the
writing
processes
for
papers
and
assignments
to
be
rather
interesting.
Not
only
do
I
usually
find
the
material
taught
in
class
interesting,
but
as
students
we
are
encouraged
to
explore
ideas
and
themes
that
interest
us
in
our
writing.
In
Ireland,
I
absolutely
loved
all
the
texts
from
my
classes,
but
I
found
writing
about
those
texts
far
less
interesting.
This
all
boils
down
to
one
point:
the
rigidity
of
the
assignments
my
professors
gave.
Because
I
was
in
classes
(and
living
with)
Irish
students,
I
was
able
to
talk
to
them
about
my
class
work.
When
I
brought
up
how
I
felt
about
the
essay
assignments,
the
Irish
students
looked
at
my
like
I
was
crazy.
They
couldnOt
imagine
ever
coming
up
with
their
own
thesis
statement
and
defending
their
ideas
by
writing
a
paper
using
sources
and
evidence
gathered
by
their
own
research.
Each
paper
I
wrote
in
Ireland
followed
a
formulaNa
formula
similar
to
the
one
I
was
taught
in
high
school,
that
rigid
5
paragraph
essay,
that
I
detested
and
so
easily
broke
free
from
(and
was
able
to
stay
away
from,
for
the
most
part)
upon
my
arrival
at
Lafayette.
My
Irish
professors
were
not
interested
in
the
least
that
their
students
come
up
with
a
unique
standpoint.
Instead
they
wanted
direct
answers
to
the
specific
questions
they
posed.
They
didnOt
want
any
creative
deviations;
they
wanted
strict
responses
and
nothing
more.
In
some
cases
my
professors
even
handed
out
sheets
of
paper
with
lists
of
appropriate
texts
to
turn
to
for
evidence
and
research.
I
felt
like
I
was
back
in
high
school;
my
writing
was
stifled.
I
was
miffed
in
the
beginning,
when
I
actually
realized
my
professors
really
did
not
want
to
hear
any
real
creativity,
but
I
quickly
learned
the
formula
they
wanted,
and
wrote
my
papers
robotically.
It
worked,
in
the
end,
because
I
did
fairly
well
in
all
of
my
courses
over
there.
IOm
not
so
sure
how,
however,
because
I
felt
my
writing
was
incredibly
weakNI
could
hardly
sneak
in
any
idea
of
my
own.
At
any
rate,
I
learned
in
Ireland
that
sometimes,
writing
is
not
all
about
what
I
may
feel
like
writing
about.
Being
abroad
gave
me
a
whole
new
appreciation
for
the
breadth
of
creativity
Lafayette
professors
allow
and
encourage
from
their
students.
At
the
same
time,
I
learned
that
people
really
do
have
different
ideas
about
what
constitutes
NgoodO
writing.
Like
I
mentioned
before,
I
am
unsure
how
that
realization
is
going
to
affect
me
as
a
WA,
but
I
know
that
for
me
the
student,
and
me
the
writer,
I
have
a
new
found
appreciation
for
creativity
and
making
writing
my
own.
I
know
this
will
only
make
me
work
harder
to
produce
unique
pieces
of
writing
in
my
future.
Looking
over
the
past
year,
well
really
the
past
two
semesters,
I
realize
I
have
been
substantially
changing
as
a
writer.
More
than
anything
else,
I
have
become
strikingly
more
aware
of
literacyNpeopleOs
perceptions
of
writing,
the
good
and
the
bad,
and
just
how
affecting
studentsO
past
experiences
with
education
and
home
life
are
to
their
literacy.
I
hope
to
continue
to
evolve
as
a
writer,
and
IOm
sure
I
will
continue
to
make
these
kinds
of
observations
in
myself
that
I
will
then
be
able
to
apply
to
the
writing
of
my
peers.
While
I
only
discussed
a
few
major
changing
points
I
saw
in
myself,
every
time
I
sit
down
to
write,
or
to
read
someone
elseOs
writing,
I
am
observing.
I
love
learning
about
writing
by
reading
works
of
others,
and
I
know
that
over
the
past
year,
whether
I
was
working
as
a
WA
with
a
freshman
on
their
first
FYS
paper,
or
talking
with
my
Irish
roommates
about
Joyce,
I
was
learning
something
about
reading
and
writing
that
will
in
turn
make
me
a
stronger
writer.
