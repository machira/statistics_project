A
Reflection
The
typewriter
was
my
babysitter.
The
soothing
clip-claps
of
letters
striking
the
paper,
like
heavy
rain
on
the
pavement,
kept
me
occupied
for
hours.
I
may
have
not
been
able
to
read
or
write
during
my
earliest
experiences
with
the
awkward
device,
but
it
was
obvious
that
the
creative
juices
inside
of
me
were
flowing.
When
my
parents
were
not
around,
it
was
not
at
all
uncommon
for
them
to
leave
me
with
my
grandmother
instead
of
a
typical
teen
babysitter.
It
might
has
well
have
been
my
personal
choice
to
spend
my
time
at
her
house.
What
young
boy
could
pass
up
every
meal
at
McDonaldOs
or
the
diner?
Is
there
a
child
out
there
who
would
say
no
to
a
house
whose
fridge
never
lacked
a
restaurant
sized
stock
of
ice-cream,
soda,
pudding,
Jell-O,
and
whipped-cream?
I
was
treated
like
gold
at
my
grandmotherOs
and
for
some
reason,
the
television
with
the
broken
antennae
never
captured
my
interest.
My
grandmother,
a
former
steno
typist
for
the
army,
kept
one
of
her
50-year
old
typewriters
in
the
house.
With
wide
curious
eyes,
I
spent
many
hours
gawking
at
the
typewriter
and
I
begged
to
play
with
it
on
a
regular
basis.
It
was
such
a
strange
object
and
it
seemed
to
tower
over
my
adolescent
body.
IOm
amazed
that
she
could
even
push
the
gargantuan
hunk
of
metal
across
a
desk,
let
along
carry
it,
when
she
was
a
younger
woman.
One
day,
my
grandmother
gave
in
and
let
me
play
with
the
typewriter.
She
lugged
it
over
to
the
kitchen
table,
threaded
in
a
piece
of
paper,
demonstrated
how
to
make
the
letters
appear,
and
let
me
go
to
work.
That
was
the
moment
I
become
hooked
on
writing.
I
guess
you
could
call
it
writing.
I
wasnOt
necessarily
putting
any
sentences,
let
alone
words,
together.
However,
it
was
obvious
that
I
was
always
concentrating
on
some
sort
of
layout
on
the
paper.
Before
long,
my
reading
and
writing
skills
progressed.
The
messy
sheets
of
paper
leaving
the
typewriter
roll
started
to
make
sense
when
read.
Simple
sentences
were
typed
at
first,
but
later
stories
and
poems
about
anything
from
my
adventures
of
the
day
to
vacations
could
be
seen
hanging
all
over
the
refrigerator.
My
grandma
begged
me
to
stop
wasting
paper,
but
I
failed
to
see
the
waste.
In
my
mind,
I
was
next
in
line
for
the
Pulitzer.
In
second
grade
I
became
a
published
author
and
illustrator.
Only
one
hard
cover
copy
ever
rolled
off
the
assembly
line
and
it
was
never
sold.
I
think
it
is
in
a
box
in
the
attic
with
the
other
books
that
I
personally
created,
wrote,
and
bound
annually
until
about
sixth
grade.
Every
year
in
elementary
school
we
spent
weeks
developing
and
writing
some
themed
book.
ThemeOs
ranged
from
NAll
About
My
Family
and
MeO
to
vacations
and
poetry.
Once
all
the
pages
were
written
and
edited,
and
my
authorOs
bibliography
was
pasted
on
the
last
page,
all
the
pages
were
bound.
My
school
had
a
simple
book
binding
machine.
Some
years
we
would
make
spiral
bound
books,
and
others
we
assemble
hard
cover,
jointed
cardboard
books.
Vibrant
in
color
and
full
of
elementary
adventures,
stories,
and
poetry,
the
books
were
the
pride
and
joy
of
the
individual
students
and
the
school.
Younger
students
were
jealous,
not
only
because
we
bound
the
books
at
stations
in
the
hallway,
but
because
the
finished
inaugural
copies
were
displayed
in
the
schoolOs
glass
display
case
in
the
hall.
Every
student
looked
forward
to
when
the
day
came
that
they
could
make
their
first
book.
One
was
never
enough.
The
process
was
never
boring
because
each
year,
students
were
eager
to
do
better
than
the
last.
High
school
was
a
literary
frustration.
For
four
years
we
read
books
from
45
year
old
pre-selected
reading
lists
and
wrote
expository
essays
ad
infinitum.
Most
novels
we
read
and
wrote
about,
we
read
because
they
were
classics.
Anything
enjoyable
I
had
already
come
across
and
read
on
my
own
at
some
prior
time.
Instead
of
introducing
students
to
new
ideas
and
modern
topics,
a
student
could
predict
with
great
accuracy
what
would
be
touched
upon
each
year.
On
a
positive
note,
I
moved
into
the
world
of
computer
processing,
pc,
and
internet
use;
obviously
an
important
step.
The
worst
part
of
high
school
English
was
that
all
writing
assignments
were
graded
strictly
on
format,
not
content.
If
a
paper
had
the
required
quotes,
lengths,
citations,
and
answered
the
topic,
the
paper
would
be
graded
highly.
A
paper
could
be
fairly
low
in
quality,
and
written
in
one
hour
on
the
eve
of
the
due
date,
yet
be
perfectly
acceptable.
Any
time
a
student
would
attempt
any
sort
of
creativity,
it
seemed
as
though
it
was
a
waste
of
energy.
Often
times
I
spent
extremely
lengthy
amounts
of
time
researching
and
writing
a
topic
that
interested
me,
and
I
found
myself
discouraged
when
I
received
no
feedback
from
the
teacher.
Students
with
cookie
cutter
papers
received
the
same
grade
as
me.
Eventually
I
found
it
un-rewarding
to
go
the
extra
step.
However,
there
were
some
positives
to
high
school
drafting.
I
became
fairly
experienced
at
writing
essays,
and
proving
points
with
a
thesis.
My
years
as
a
high
school
writer
were
spent
either
composing
five
paragraph
expository
thesis
essays,
or
writing
research
papers.
Usually
one
essay
per
month
was
assigned.
Each
essay
had
to
prove
our
answer
to
a
particular
question
about
a
novel.
Proof
was
found
in
a
three
point
thesis
format.
Additionally
each
year,
students
were
required
to
write
one
research
paper.
My
two
favorite
research
papers
were
on
the
effects
Jimi
Hendrix
left
on
pop-culture
and
music,
and
a
critical
examination
of
John
SteinbeckOs
Canner
Row.
Teachers
provided
a
lot
of
class
time
to
research
the
topics.
Along
with
just
writing
the
papers,
in
school
peer-editing
took
place.
Lastly,
in
order
to
force
students
to
develop
papers
correctly,
we
were
required
to
turn
in
outlines
and
note
cards
weeks
in
advance
of
a
paperOs
due
date.
It
was
exciting
to
reach
the
end
of
high
school
because
I
knew
college
would
be
a
healthy
change.
For
the
finale
of
my
least
favorite
time
in
my
writing
career,
I
wrote
a
few
college
essays.
For
the
first
time
ever,
I
found
that
to
fully
develop
and
write
my
essays,
I
needed
other
people
to
read
and
comment
on
them.
Since
I
was
finally
writing
for
an
audience
and
was
trying
to
sell
myself
in
an
essay,
I
went
to
all
my
family
members
for
advice
and
analysis.
After
writing
a
few
essays
about
why
IOm
great
and
about
the
things
that
I
have
accomplished,
I
threw
them
away.
I
was
not
at
all
comfortable
with
the
concept
of
writing
about
myself.
It
felt
arrogant
and
fake.
I
ended
up
writing
an
essay
about
the
effects
my
great-grandfather
had
on
my
entire
familyOs
lives
and
personalities.
I
mainly
wrote
the
paper
upon
personal
reflection,
family
interviews,
and
personal
examinations
of
my
familyOs
behavior.
Although
I
did
not
enjoy
the
period
of
college
essay
development,
I
did
end
up
writing
my
favorite
work
up
to
that
date.
It
left
a
large
emotional
effect
on
each
member
of
my
family
that
read
it,
including
myself.
I
imagine
that
that
was
a
sign
of
a
good
piece
of
writing.
Before
I
started
my
freshmen
year,
I
was
not
quite
sure
what
to
expect
of
college
writing.
I
felt
prepared,
but
not
because
of
high
school
development.
I
read
a
lot
over
the
years,
and
I
think
that
reading
really
changes
the
way
the
mind
works
and
how
one
views
the
world.
I
read
anything
from
fiction
and
science
fiction,
to
physics
and
philosophy.
I
definitely
think
that
free-reading
developed
me
for
college
and
strengthened
my
intellect
more
than
any
one
scholastic
class.
When
I
began
my
first
semester
at
Lafayette,
I
was
greeted
by
a
wonderful
surprise:
FYS.
From
day
one,
I
wrote
constantly.
At
first
I
felt
unsure
of
myself
because
I
was
being
asked
to
write
freely,
subjectively,
creatively,
and
sometimes
in
first
person.
I
never
used
those
writing
techniques
in
high
school.
My
FYS
was
on
the
appeal
of
evil
in
western
culture.
It
was
a
very
philosophical
class
that
related
many
literary
works
with
current
and
past
events
in
our
history.
I
loved
every
moment
of
the
course.
My
best
experiences
as
a
writer
took
place
during
my
time
in
the
course.
Throughout
the
duration
of
the
semester
each
student
worked
to
develop
his
own
final
paper
regarding
the
topic
of
evil.
I
ended
up
combining
all
of
my
ideas
and
writing
assignments
from
the
semester
to
create
a
two
part,
15-page
paper
on
the
definition
of
evil.
It
was
a
very
fulfilling
experience
to
write
something
that
felt
so
original
and
my
own.
I
worked
with
WAOs,
the
professor,
and
peer-editors
the
whole
time.
Best
of
all,
I
constantly
gained
substantial
and
helpful
feedback
for
the
first
time
in
my
life.
Feedback
is
intimidating
and
frustrating
at
some
times,
and
at
other
times
it
is
gladly
welcomed.
I
always
welcomed
feedback
during
my
time
in
FYS,
but
most
times
I
felt
like
whatever
I
had
written
was
being
picked
apart
and
critiqued
too
heavily
by
the
professor.
It
was
not
until
the
conclusion
of
the
semester
when
I
realized
how
helpful
the
harsh
editing
of
the
professor
and
the
writing
associates
had
been.
Throughout
the
weeks
I
was
constantly
required
to
demand
more
of
myself.
Furthermore,
my
writing
style
was
forced
to
be
perfectly
clear.
It
is
one
thing
for
the
writer
to
understand
what
he
is
writing.
It
is
a
totally
different
scenario
for
the
reader
to
gain
the
writerOs
exact
perspective.
It
is
hard
for
ideas
and
perceptions
to
match.
My
FYS
and
faculty/peer
constructive
criticism
helped
me
to
appreciate
that
concept.
As
a
result
of
my
FYS,
my
writing
abilities
are
now
amplified
dramatically.
Very
few
of
my
encounters
with
writing
have
been
the
same.
My
mom
always
says
that
variety
is
the
spice
of
life,
and
I
wholly
agree.
As
a
result
of
a
strong
education
system
and
a
lot
of
hours
with
my
head
buried
in
a
book,
the
diverse
mixture
of
writing
experiences
in
my
life
have
led
me
to
where
I
am
today.
