Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative
Lessons
and
Experiences
Gained
from
Being
a
Writing
Associate
Working
as
a
WA
for
the
college
writing
program
over
the
past
year
has
given
me
an
interesting
new
outlook
on
writing
my
own
essays,
and
also
while
reading
over
the
works
of
others.
Whether
the
experience
was
from
meeting
one
on
one
with
student
writers,
group
conferences
with
student
writers,
or
helping
people
in
the
WA
drop
in
hours,
each
conference
has
provided
me
with
valuable
lessons
of
what
can
be
learned
through
peer
interaction
and
collaboration
with
writing.
Whether
these
experiences
were
very
successful,
or
perhaps
unexpected
and
even
awkward,
each
has
given
me
a
new
perspective
on
how
to
work
cooperatively
with
other
students
in
order
to
create
new
ideas
and
help
one
another
with
transcribing
thoughts
to
paper.
When
I
first
entered
the
College
Writing
Program
as
a
writing
associate
last
fall,
I
did
not
have
a
very
clear
picture
as
to
what
the
ideal
WA
conference
should
be
like.
Perhaps
the
one
thing
I
did
know,
from
previous
WA
conferences
as
a
student
writer
myself,
is
that
the
conversations
during
these
meetings
were
not
to
be
one
sided,
both
of
us
were
to
contribute
ideas.
Thus,
when
I
was
a
new
writing
associate,
it
was
clear
to
me
that
I
would
be
working
together
with
other
students,
rather
than
teaching
them
solely
on
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
D
I
knew
I
would
not
be
dictating
information.
On
the
other
hand,
I
did
know
that
it
was
my
job
to
help
people
improve
the
essays
they
were
working
on,
and
though
I
knew
I
would
not
be
dictating
information,
I
was
a
little
unsure
of
how
I
would
help
make
a
studentOs
writing
stronger
without
telling
them
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do.
Early
into
the
fall
of
2011,
I
was
quickly
taught
the
main
approach
that
writing
associates
use
to
discuss
ideas
and
help
give
direction
to
the
student
writerOs
assignments,
it
was
called
the
facilitative
approach.
This
approach
usually
involves
asking
questions
that
begin
discussions
or
conversations
about
a
topic,
and
typically
motivate
student
writers
to
think
critically
about
certain
aspects
of
their
essays
that
they
want
to
improve.
These
can
include
their
thesis
sentences,
overall
flow
and
organization,
or
just
the
general
understanding
of
the
prompt
or
assignment.
The
main
strength
of
the
facilitative
approach
is
that
the
learning
process
is
not
one
directional,
the
conferences
do
not
involve
the
writing
associate
telling
the
student
writer
what
is
wrong
or
right,
or
what
is
good
or
bad.
Instead,
the
ideas
are
coming
from
the
student
writer
themselves,
and
they
are
discussed
collaboratively
to
figure
out
how
to
transcribe
their
thoughts
into
their
essay.
This
allows
for
the
student
writer
to
retain
ownership
of
their
essay,
and
for
them
to
learn
how
to
approach
a
similar
writing
situation
in
the
future.
In
addition,
the
facilitative
approach
gives
confidence
to
students,
helping
them
realize
that
their
ideas
and
skills
as
a
writer
are
valuable,
and
that
they
can
continue
to
tackle
harder
writing
obstacles
in
the
future.
During
my
experience
as
a
writing
associate,
I
quickly
learned
that
there
are
some
instances
where
the
facilitative
approach
may
not
be
the
ideal
method
to
use
during
a
WA
conference.
The
times
that
I
noticed
this
methodOs
ineffectiveness
mostly
occurred
while
I
was
on
my
shift
in
WA
drop
in
hours.
The
reason
for
this
is
that
most,
if
not
all
of
the
student
writers
that
have
dropped
by
while
I
was
on
duty
were
usually
in
the
final
writing
stage
of
their
papers.
Their
intention
and
purpose
of
coming
to
WA
drop
in
hours
was
mainly
to
ensure
that
the
organization
and
grammar
of
their
essay
was
smooth
and
correct.
At
this
stage
of
the
writing
process,
these
student
writers
have
already
thought
critically
about
the
ideas
that
are
going
into
their
paper,
and
instead
are
looking
for
concrete
answers
to
questions
that
simply
do
not
require
a
discussion.
Although
these
student
writers
are
looking
for
direct
answers
to
their
questions,
I
still
try
to
give
feedback
as
a
reader,
something
that
is
always
important
and
valuable
when
a
writing
associate
is
reading
an
assignment.
A
successful
WA
conference
can
be
a
variety
of
things,
from
an
interesting
discussion
of
ideas,
to
a
very
clear
and
strong
argument
or
answer
to
a
professorOs
prompt
or
question.
It
is
also
important
to
remember
that
not
all
WA
conferences
have
to
take
the
same
direction.
Therefore,
having
an
open
mind
and
a
flexible
approach
to
the
conferences
should
allow
for
more
successful
sessions.
For
example,
even
though
I
have
come
upon
a
few
assignments
that
did
not
include
sections
that
the
professor
requested,
such
as
a
missing
conclusion
or
even
missing
body
paragraphs,
a
valuable
discussion
can
still
take
place
between
the
student
and
I.
Often
times
the
thought
process
is
the
most
intricate
and
complex
part
of
the
writing
process,
and
taking
part
of
this
process
with
a
student
writer,
sometimes
before
any
writing
has
even
taken
place,
can
lead
to
many
ideas
and
discussions.
Although
WA
conferences
usually
go
very
smoothly
and
comfortably,
there
are
times
when
awkward
or
uncomfortable
situations
arise.
Usually,
I
have
found
that
these
situations
occur
when
there
is
a
significant
difference
in
the
intentions
of
both
the
writing
associate
and
the
student
writer.
For
example,
as
a
writing
associate,
I
always
try
to
enter
WA
conferences
with
the
intention
of
discussing
both
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
a
studentOs
paper,
and
to
ensure
that
what
the
student
has
brainstormed
follows
smoothly
when
they
write
their
ideas
on
paper.
Sometimes
though,
a
student
writer
will
enter
a
conference
with
little
motivation
to
discuss
their
paper.
This
can
be
shown
through
body
language,
like
leaning
back
in
a
chair,
answering
in
short
responses
without
engaging
the
conversation
at
hand,
and
by
yawning,
tapping
pens,
etc.
When
this
occurs,
sometimes
I
find
that
talking
about
something
unrelated
to
the
assignment
at
hand
can
regain
the
studentOs
attention,
and
once
this
occurs,
more
time
can
be
spent
working
together
on
the
paper.
Other
times,
when
it
is
very
evident
that
the
students
have
no
interest
in
being
at
the
conference
whatsoever,
I
usually
just
write
down
what
parts
of
the
paper
could
be
changed
to
create
a
stronger
essay,
but
allow
the
students
to
brainstorm
ideas
on
their
own
while
proofreading
on
their
own.
Rather
than
holding
a
conference
during
which
the
student
is
not
engaged,
it
may
be
more
valuable
to
cut
the
conference
short,
and
allow
the
writer
to
think
critically
on
his
own,
allowing
him
to
return
to
me
with
questions
or
comments
via
email
or
even
holding
another
brief
meeting.
While
reflecting
on
my
experiences
as
a
writing
associate,
I
am
very
glad
to
say
that
these
instances
have
not
occurred
very
often,
and
the
general
trend
amongst
my
WA
conferences
involves
engaged
students
and
many
ideas
discussed.
My
experiences
as
a
writing
associate
have
also
had
an
effect
on
both
the
style
and
the
outlook
towards
my
writing.
For
example,
the
number
one
lesson
I
have
learned
from
being
a
writing
associate
is
that
there
is
no
wrong
or
right
way
to
address
a
question
or
assignment.
In
fact,
it
has
come
to
my
attention
that
different
ways
of
going
about
presenting
information
to
an
audience
is
very
important
when
trying
to
create
new
ideas
and
add
on
to
existing
ones.
In
addition,
I
have
noticed
that
my
own
writing
has
become
more
straightforward
and
to
the
point,
rather
than
dancing
around
questions
or
adding
unnecessary
information.
I
have
also
stayed
more
on
topic
and
become
more
specific
with
my
details
in
my
most
recent
essays.
Perhaps
remembering
the
advice
I
give
to
other
student
writers
comes
in
handy
when
proofreading
my
own
work.
In
addition,
one
of
the
most
valuable
lessons
I
have
learned
during
the
writing
process
is
to
now
allow
someone
else
to
read
my
paper.
The
experiences
I
have
had
during
WA
conferences
is
more
than
enough
evidence
for
me,
that
many
new
ideas
or
suggestions
can
arise
when
working
together
with
a
peer
on
improving
an
assignment.
After
being
a
writing
associate
for
one
full
year,
I
now
have
many
rewarding
and
meaningful
experiences
under
my
belt.
While
I
have
had
many
interesting
and
rewarding
discussions
in
my
first
year
seminar
in
the
fall
semester
of
2011,
I
have
truly
been
able
to
examine
and
participate
in
the
growth
of
the
student
writers
from
the
psychology
design
and
analysis
class
that
I
was
assigned
to
during
the
spring
semester
of
2012.
The
reason
for
this
is
that
the
sole
assignment
that
was
given
to
these
students
was
an
extensive
research
and
lab
report
that
began
in
the
second
week
of
their
semester,
and
was
finally
due
in
the
last
week
of
the
semester.
There
were
four
steps
to
the
lab
report,
with
a
brainstorming
phase,
an
introductions
and
methods
section,
a
results
and
conclusion
segment,
and
finally
proofreading
the
paper
as
a
whole.
Working
with
these
student
writers
last
semester
was
perhaps
my
most
rewarding
experience
as
a
writing
associate,
because
I
witnessed
the
growth
of
students
who
originally
struggled
to
explain
to
me
how
their
in
class
experiment
would
occur,
including
the
purpose
and
design
of
their
research.
At
the
end
of
the
semester,
instead
of
me
explaining
and
outlining
what
the
purpose
of
the
research
and
in
class
experiment
was,
they
were
instead
describing
the
assignment
in
its
entirety
to
me
in
their
own
words.
To
me,
this
was
the
most
rewarding
experience
as
a
writing
associate,
because
it
was
a
clear
demonstration
of
the
learning
process
that
goes
on
with
students
after
their
WA
conferences,
how
meeting
with
me
might
motivate
them
to
think
critically
and
analytically
about
the
assignment
at
hand.
