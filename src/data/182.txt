My
History
as
a
Writer...
over
the
last
year
Ah...
another
easy
question
to
ask
but
difficult
one
to
answer.
Responding
to
a
question
like
this,
which
requires
much
self-reflective
thought,
is
hard,
well,
at
least
for
most.
For
me,
no
problem
I've
been
spending
my
summer
training
myself
to
self-reflect
as
part
of
the
production
of
writing
a
self-help
book.
So
how
can
one
more
self-reflection
question
hurt?
A
lot.
Such
searching
enables
you
to
become
your
own
critic
and
guides
you
in
sifting
out
the
fake
from
the
real.
The
truth
can
often
hurt,
but
it
is
also
the
only
thing
that
will
make
you
learn
and
become
better
at
whatever
it
is
you
may
do,
including
writing.
The
only
way
to
answer
a
question
like
this
is
to
be
honest.
Accept
yourself
as
a
writer.
Reward
yourself
for
being
a
good
writer,
but
be
critical
of
yourself
too
because
writing
isn't
easy
and
no
one
can
be
a
'^perfect"
writer.
The
process
of
learning
to
be
a
writer
goes
on
forever.
You
do
not
reach
a
certain
grade
or
a
certain
age
or
become
a
well-known
author
or
win
a
literary
award
and
think
to
yourself
that
now
you
know
all
there
is
to
know
about
writing.
Your
writing
process
is
not
suddenly
complete
where
everything
you
turn
out
is
a
polished,
finished,
exceptional
piece.
You,
and
I,
and
everyone
else
who
picks
up
a
pen
or
sits
by
a
keyboard,
no
matter
what
age
or
profession
or
how
well
received
by
the
literary
world,
is
still
learning
how
to
write.
You
cannot
think
you
know
all
there
is
to
know
about
writing,
even
if
you
have
mastered
exercises
with
split
infinitives
or
can
recognize
every
misplaced
modifier.
There
is
always
some
way
to
improve
your
own
writing.
Better
writing
begins
with
better
listening.
I
once
had
an
appointment
with
a
senior
student
who
didn't
show
up.
I
called
him
and
told
him
I
would
like
to
meet
with
him
to
discuss
his
paper.
He
told
me,
"I
am
a
senior.
I
have
been
writing
papers
for
four
years
now.
I
don't
need
a
WA."
He
was
wrong.
Everyone
needs
a
WA.
The
heads
of
English
departments
have
other
writers
proofread
their
work
and
authors
have
editors.
Good
writing
doesn't
come
with
how
many
term
papers
you
have
written
but
with
patience,
practice
and
the
right
attitude
that
all
writing
can
be
improved.
Being
a
WA
is
about
getting
a
second
opinion.
Those
who
benefit
from
going
to
see
the
WAs
are
not
bad
writers
who
need
to
be
told
how
to
write
a
sentence,
noun
before
verb,
but
good
writers
who
want
a
cheerful
ear.
WAs
are
Willing
Assistants
to
others'
writing,
as
well
as
Writing
Associates.
Being
a
WA
means
being
a
listener.
The
most
difficult
time
in
my
recent
past
history
as
a
writer
was
this
past
semester
in
Italy
when
I
studied
writing
under
a
woman
named
Dorothea--a
British
lady
who
was
indisputably
both
mean
and
blunt.
She
knew
it
too.
She
told
us
we
were
stupid
and
assured
us
that
out
of
35
students
in
the
class,
only
few
could
write.
No
matter
what
I
handed
into
her
I
got
a
B.
The
first
time
I
wrote
she
told
me
I
was
too
distant
from
my
writing.
I
wrote
in
blah
adjectives
describing
too
much
at
one
time
so
that
in
a
sense
I
was
saying
nothing
at
all.
She
told
me
to
close
my
eyes
and
hear,
smell
and
feel.
Then
she
told
me
to
open
them
and
look.
I
was
to
then
take
a
piece
of
paper
and
answer
the
questions
where,
when,
why,
what
and
how
and
answer
each
using
my
five
senses.
So
the
next
time
I
wrote
I
did
just
that.
I
was
so
proud
of
my
piece
I
entered
it
into
my
daily
journal.
I
got
a
B.
I
was
too
basic
or
something
like
that.
I
didn't
do
anything
someone
else
couldn't
have
done.
So
the
next
time
I
wrote
a
personal
essay
about
my
worst
critic
(besides
myself),
a
woman
who
never
gives
me
a
chance.
Now
this
no
one
else
could
write,
it
was
about
me.
I
liked
this
one
even
more
than
the
last.
She
didn't.
She
gave
me
a
B.
So
finally
I
wrote
my
heart
out
describing
this
gruesome
older
man
who
sexually
harassed
me
on
a
train
going
from
Nice,
France
to
Florence,
Italy.
I
used
two
tenses
and
two
tones
of
expression
to
mix
with
emotions.
I
remembered
my
five
senses,
I
wrote
about
something
personal
and
original
that
no
one
else
could
have
written
about
because
I
was
writing
through
my
own
eyes,
remembering
the
dirty
smells
that
only
I
smelled,
hearing
his
unrecognizable
mumbling
that
only
I
listened
to.
The
paper
was
only
allowed
to
be
one
page
long,
but
in
that
page
I
described
to
the
best
of
my
ability,
what
was
perhaps
one
of
the
most
disturbing
moments
of
my
life.
It
was
for
sure
my
most
developed
piece.
I
got
a
B.
"What
about
his
psychology?
Why
not
analyze
hirri?
Everyone
always
talks
about
themselves
and
their
own
fears.
Try
talking
about
it
from
his
point
of
view.
Anyone
can
tell
your
side
of
the
story,"
were
her
comments.
And
then,
"Here,
read
Victoria's
piece.
Now
this
is
good
writing."
So
you
might
be
asking
yourself,
'so
what?'
Well,
I
learned
something
in
that
class
that
made
me
a
better,
more
confident
writer.
I
learned,
besides
the
fact
that
one
too
many
Bs
can
drive
someone
to
go
nuts,
that
Dorothea
didn't
know
how
to
appreciate
different
kinds
of
writing.
I
learned
that
as
a
WA
I
cannot
be
like
my
past
professor.
She
presupposed
what
good
writing
was
and
unless
you
mattltgd
that
outline,
it
wasn't
good
enough.
She
let
her
own
voice
get
in
the
way.
She
didn't
take
time
to
listen
and
hear
the
writer's
voice.
From
this
professor
(and
miserable
three-month
writing
experience)
I
learned
to
listen.
It
would
be
nice
if
all
writing
associate
appointments
resulted
in
a
mutually
beneficent
experience.
It
should
be
understood
that
both
the
writer
and
associate
benefit
from
the
conference.
Like
I
said
before,
we
could
all
improve
our
writing.
It
is
not
just
the
WA-ee
that
needs
to
improve
but
also
the
WA.
A
rewarding
or
simply
worthwhile
conference
will
improve
the
WA's
writing
at
the
same
time
that
the
WA
aids
in
improving
her
peer's
writing.
However,
conferences
do
not
always
work
like
this
because
typically,
the
writer
will
show
up
with
two
out
of
ten
pages
typed,
no
thesis,
and
a
poor
attitude
towards
the
program
Or
at
least
this
is
what
happened
to
me
in
WA-ing
a
junior/senior
class.
Instead
of
discussing
writing
we
would
end
up
discussing
the
assignment
and
then
the
students
would
leave
room
319
to
begin
a
paper
that
would
go
to
their
professor
virtually
un-proofread.
However,
there
are
also
rewarding
experiences.
The
writers
who
realize
that
the
session
is
not
about
one
student
acting
like
a
professor
scolding
the
other
student
on
misspelling
recieve
but
about
one
student's
willingness
to
listen
to
another
student's
ideas,
are
the
ones
who
will
aid
in
a
mutually
beneficent
experience.
In
these
sessions
both
the
WA
and
the
writer
will
learn
a
lot
about
writing
and
will
both,
simultaneously,
learn
to
self-reflect
and
become
their
own
critics
of
what
they
type
into
the
computer
screen.
I
found
myself
developing
and
establishing
a
writing
identity
once
I
acknowledged
that
there
isn't
one
way
to
write
well.
I
used
to
look
at
other
students
writing
for
similarities
to
my
own
writing
to
assure
myself
that
I
was
writing
"correctly."
It
wasn't
until
I
read
some
outstanding
papers
by
some
students
who
wrote
better
or
simply
differently
than
I
do
that
I
understood
that
each
writer
has
his
own
voice
and
no
two
voices
are
exactly
alike.
I
learned
to
judge
good
writing
not
based
in
comparison
to
my
own
voice
(and
who
gave
me
such
modesty
anyway)
but
on
the
writer's
original
voice.
Therefore,
I,
as
a
WA,
had
to
learn
to
listen
so
that
I
could
hear
the
writer's
voice,
not
my
own.
In
learning
this,
I
decided
it
was
time
to
throw
out
all
the
old
papers
written
by
what
I
thought
was
standard
"good"
writing
and
begin
to
write
for
myself,
with
my
own
voice.
I
learned
and
am
still
learning
how
to
establish
my
own
writing
identity.
Writing
my
own
book
in
which
my
voice
is
the
main
character
speaking
to
my
readers
has
helped
further
my
study
in
developing
a
strong,
independent
writing
voice
because
THAT
is
what
makes
writing
good.
So
I
guess
what
I
am
trying
to
say
is
this:
I'm
the
WA.
I
have
the
answers.
Right?
WRONG.
That
is
what
I
thought.
What
I
learned
was
I
am
a
peer
who
is
willing
to
read
a
friend's,
classmate's,
co-worker's,
even
professor's
paper,
listen,
and
respond.
I
always
knew
how
to
write,
but
there
is
a
difference
between
writing
and
writing
well.
And
it
is
questionable
what
writing
well
means.
I
consider
myself
a
good
writer
because
I
keep
myself
focused
on
speaking
with
my
own
voice,
but
I
don't
consider
myself
a
strong
writer.
The
voice
that
speaks
to
all
of
you
squeaks
and
cracks
and
mumbles.
I
will
not
be
a
great
writer
until
I
can
shout
out
to
my
readers
in
my
own
voice.
And
even
then
I
will
still
have
something
else
to
work
on.
To
those
of
you
who
think
you
are
better
writers
than
your
peers,
ask
yourself
if
it
is
because
you
have
your
own
writing
voice
or
if
it
is
because
you
have
studied
the
St.
Martin's
Handbook
more
closely
than
they
have.
Grammar
and
spelling
and
learning
to
write
a
thesis
are
necessities,
no
doubt,
but
there
is
aaether
reason
we
all
got
picked
for
this
job,
so
we
better
learn
to
accept
the
responsibility.
We
got
picked
because
our
professors
heard
our
unique
voices
on
paper,
and
in
turn,
it
is
our
job
to
hear
our
peers.
Writing
is
a
learned
skill
that
anyone
can
be
taught.
Writing
well
takes
a
lot
of
patience
and
practice
and
the
right
attitude.
Being
a
good
writer
means
you
know
you
have
a
lot
of
improving
to
do.
Being
a
writer
who
assists
others
means
you
know
how
to
listen.
To
all
WAs:
you
may
know
how
to
write
but
you
better
learn
how
to
listen.
And
there
is
always
something
more
to
learn
or
to
improve
on
so
if
the
WA-ee
doesn't
learn
anything,
you
will,
and
you
will
be
a
better
writer
for
it.
