Writing
Reflections
Reflections,
which
according
to
the
fourth
definition
in
the
Oxford
American
Dictionary
is
defined
as
a
"deep
thought,
an
idea
or
statement
produced
by
this",
is
a
word
present
at
the
conception
of
my
writing
career
and
intricately
laced
throughout
my
journey
as
a
writer.
It
is
a
term
that
held
a
one-dimensional
meaning
in
my
early
stages
of
writing
but
grew
many
layers
of
significance
as
I
changed
and
developed
into
the
writer
I
am
today.
The
earliest
experience
with
what
I
consider
to
be
real
writing
occurred
in
my
second
grade
class.
Until
this
point,
any
writing
I
did
was
nothing
but
a
litany
of
sentences
that
I
had
to
write
using
my
vocabulary
words,
assigned
daily
by
my
wise
and
endearing
first
grade
teacher,
Mrs.
Davis.
Much
to
my
delight,
Mrs.
Fesolovich
s
second
grade
class
did
not
have
to
churn
out
vocabulary
sentences,
however
this
class
did
have
a
writing
routine
-our
daily
newsletter.
Everyday
around
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning,
I,
along
with
my
classmates,
prepared
to
write
the
daily
newsletter
to
which
the
entire
class
contributed
descriptions
of
the
weather,
events
occurring
at
the
school,
and
classmates'
birthdays.
One
gray
winter
day
in
January,
ten
o'clock
arrived,
but
class
did
not
follow
the
normal
routine.
Instead,
Mrs.
Fesolovich
announced
that
the
PTA
was
sponsoring
the
annual
Reflections
contest,
a
competition
that
challenged
all
grade
levels
to
write,
draw
paint,
photograph,
or
compose
anything
they
reflected
the
said
topic
-
The
Past
or
The
Future.
In
place
of
our
newsletter,
the
class
was
to
write
something
that
captured
the
years
gone
by
or
the
promise
of
years
to
come.
I
remember
sitting
at
my
desk
with
my
fat,
red
pencil
in
hand,
straining
to
think
of
something
to
write,
when
I
finally
conceived
an
idea
for
a
story.
As
I
reread
my
little
tale
about
myself
as
ancient
woman
narrating
the
story
of
her
great-great-etc.
granddaughter's
birthday
party
and
all
of
her
futuristic
toys,
I
laugh
and
think
the
judges
must
have
been
crazy
to
select
my
story
as
a
winner.
In
reflection,
however,
I
see
this
as
a
truly
important
moment
in
my
life
as
a
writer,
for
it
instilled
a
confidence
in
me,
and
it
also
showed
me
that
writing
a
quirky
little
story
could
be
fun.
Throughout
the
remainder
of
elementary
school,
I
sadly
saw
writing
as
a
chore.
Book
reports
were
tasks
I
dreaded
and
deemed
as
busy
work.
If
I
read
the
book,
why
should
I
have
to
regurgitate
the
facts
for
someone
else?
And
if
book
reports
were
not
bad
enough,
I
deplored
my
fourth
grade
writing
assignments
even
more.
I
still
remember
saying
to
my
mom
(who
is
an
English
teacher
no
less)
that
I
was
a
science
girl
,
who
saw
writing
a
report
on
Gettysburg
and,
later,
on
Illinois
(simply
because
I
loved
the
Chicago
Bears)
as
a
waste
of
a
perfectly
good
weekend.
More
and
more,
I
began
to
fester
this
great
disdain
for
anything
that
had
to
do
with
English
-
grammar
lessons,
grammar
homework,
and
even
writing.
In
hindsight,
I
think
I
finally
understand
why
I
hated
writing
and
English,
while
at
the
same
time
loving
science.
I
saw
writing
these
stupid
reports
and
grammar
classes
as
restrictive,
whereas
science
was
exploratory.
What
I
did
not
know
was
that
the
structure
and
groundwork
being
laid
in
my
formative
writing
years
would
allow
me
a
freedom
to
express
and
create
like
no
other.
The
middle
school
finally
arrived,
and
the
great
dichotomy
of
writing
ensued
-
English
class
and
language
arts
class.
How
could
I
dread
English
everyday,
denouncing
the
merit
of
diagramming
sentences,
but
at
the
same
time
look
forward
to
language
arts
and
the
crazy,
entertaining
assignments
that
went
along?
Although
I
did
not
realize
it
then,
my
language
arts
classes
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
grades
were
important
steps
in
developing
my
appreciation
for
writing.
Stubbornly,
I
kept
telling
my
mom
(and
myself)
that
I
only
cared
about
science
when
she
was
encouraging
me
to
write,
but
I
could
not
deny
that
I
genuinely
enjoyed
some
of
my
writing
assignments.
I
remember
yet
another
Reflections
contest
for
which
I
entered
a
poem
about
the
mystique
of
the
ocean,
because
that
year's
topic
was
The
Wonders
of
the
World
.
I
knew
the
ocean
was
not
an
official
wonder
of
the
world,
but
it
amazed
and
enthralled
me.
My
fifth
grade
autobiography,
when
first
assigned
seemed
like
a
tedious
and
aggravating
project,
but
as
I
became
absorbed
with
the
task,
I
enjoyed
writing
silly
captions
for
the
pictures
and
recounting
the
memorable
moments
of
my
life.
Then,
in
sixth
grade,
I
encountered
the
Sense
Booklet
.
The
project
was,
of
course,
part
of
the
language
arts
curriculum
because
English
could
ever
be
that
fun!
One
week
of
class
was
devoted
to
a
different
sense
everyday,
and
at
the
end,
a
creative
account
of
what
happened
to
our
senses
was
due.
I
was
amazed
to
learn
how
easily
descriptive
language
flowed
when
I
thought
of
words
in
terms
of
the
five
senses.
I
wrote
of
the
chiffon-like
feel
of
a
marshmallow;
the
cinnamon-spiced
scent
of
a
graham
cracker;
the
tingling
taste
of
a
starlight
peppermint;
the
sparkling
amber
of
a
glass
of
ginger-ale;
and
the
chaotic,
tinkling
sound
of
popcorn
popping.
Recognizing
the
power
of
sensory
words
from
participating
in
the
Sense
Booklet
was
a
priceless
lesson
that
furthered
my
interest
in
writing.
Seventh
grade
English
class
was
the
keystone
in
my
development
as
a
writer.
This
was
the
year
when
I
was
exposed
to
Mrs.
Lisandrelli,
one
of
the
greatest
teachers
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
learn
from.
It
was
the
year
where
English
class
and
language
arts
class
fused
into
one,
and
I
began
to
see
the
relationship
of
structure
and
freedom
in
writing.
Through
Mrs.
Lisandrelli,
I
discovered
what
grammar
was
providing
for
me
-
a
myriad
of
options
that
I
could
manipulate
to
breathe
life
into
my
writing.
Her
class
enabled
me
to
dabble
in
many
different
mediums
of
writing,
such
as
poems,
narratives,
stories,
reaction
papers,
and
reports.
I
also
learned
the
value
of
brainstorming,
outlining,
editing,
and
reflecting
on
what
I
have
read,
learned,
and
written.
Seventh
grade
was
a
monumental
year
in
my
writing
history,
and
to
this
day,
I
regularly
talk
with
Mrs.
Lisandrelli
and
consult
her
expert
opinion
and
advice
on
writing.
Freshman
year,
I
transferred
from
my
familiar
public
school
to
the
strict,
private
Jesuit
school,
Scranton
Prep.
No
area
of
my
life
was
left
untouched
by
this
great
change,
including
writing.
As
a
ninth
grade
English
student,
I
was
introduced
to
the
infamous
Core
system.
Coming
from
a
public
school
and
not
having
any
older
siblings
who
attended
Prep,
I
was
stupefied
and
a
little
nervous
as
to
why
I
needed
this
core
book
.
I
had
heard
horror
stories
about
core
papers
in
which
students
had
failed
to
use
proper
core
structure,
thus
receiving
a
terrible
grade.
Once
I
was
thrown
into
the
world
of
cores,
I
quickly
realized
it
was
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
me
as
a
young
writer.
This
curriculum
spanned
four
years
of
English
classes
at
Prep
and
was
developed
by
the
great
Vincent
J.
Vanston,
a
Prep
icon.
Mr.
Vanston
was
a
gangly,
ghoulish
looking
man,
who
not
surprisingly
owned
a
funeral
parlor;
however
this
man
was
an
exceptional
writer
and
teacher
who
bestowed
a
love
of
writing
upon
generations
of
Prep
students.
Although
I
never
had
Mr.
Vanston
as
a
teacher,
I
studied
the
core
system,
which
consisted
of
many
different
grammatical
constructions
that
must
be
used
as
core
sentences
in
our
papers.
Before
this,
I
never
fully
realized
the
countless
ways
that
I
could
maneuver
sentences
and
words
to
add
zest
and
impact
to
my
writing.
Freshman
year
Mrs.
Moyles
started
the
class
writing
cores
before
we
were
even
aware
of
it
-
a
sly
tactic
that
proved
cores
were
not
as
terrifying
as
the
rumors
about
them.
Then,
sophomore
year,
Dr.
Stringfellow,
a
slight
woman
with
a
unique
accent
that
blended
the
South
and
Britain
with
a
hint
of
New
York,
demanded
precision
out
of
our
core
sentences.
With
this
adherence
to
structure,
however,
came
a
call
for
creativity.
No
mirror-imaging
of
sample
sentences
would
do
for
Dr.
Stringfellow,
but
rather
paragraphs
that
flowed
in
and
out
of
core
sentences,
never
sounding
forced.
Junior
year
brought
Mrs.
Kuhn
the
British
Literature
enthusiast,
who
introduced
the
class
to
research
and
analytical
papers.
Mrs.
Kuhn
began
the
year
by
allowing
us
to
only
use
cores
in
our
papers,
but
finished
the
year
letting
us
write
to
our
liking
-
all
of
us
subconsciously
using
a
variety
of
cores.
Finally,
Miss
Morgan's
senior
American
literature
class
arrived,
and
I
loved
every
minute
of
it.
I
read
amazing
works
of
literature,
listened
to
music
that
Miss
Morgan
felt
tied
in
to
what
was
read,
reflected
upon
the
words
and
music,
and
wrote
real
papers.
Yes,
t
still
wrote
core
papers,
but
this
year
they
had
meaning
and
importance.
I
began
to
write
about
what
I
felt,
what
moved
me,
and
what
literature
meant
to
me.
From
my
paper
about
Jim
Morrison
and
the
Doors
to
my
term
paper
on
Nathaniel
Hawthorne
and
his
religious
overtones,
I
discovered,
with
Miss
Morgan
as
my
guide,
that
writing
should
say
something,
not
just
anything.
Although
high
school
prepared
me
for
college
and
allowed
me
to
enjoy
writing,
it
was
not
until
I
entered
Lafayette
that
I
finally
acknowledged
myself
as
someone
who
wanted
to
devote
their
studies
to
English
and
writing.
I
believe
that
fate
or
else
the
wonders
of
class
scheduling
threw
me
into
an
FYS
that
revolved
around
creative
writing.
I
stared
glassy-eyed
at
the
syllabus
on
the
first
day
of
class,
convinced
I
would
never
be
able
to
survive
the
semester,
but
after
the
first
two
weeks
I
fell
in
love
with
writing.
I
was
amazed
to
find
that
I
had
fun
writing
my
project
packets
,
all
of
which
were
over
fifteen
pages!
The
most
memorable
piece
of
writing
that
emerged
from
the
class
was
a
short
story
I
had
written.
I
will
never
forget
the
feeling
at
12:30
A.M.
when
an
idea
struck
out
of
nowhere.
I
did
not
stop
writing
until
3:00
A.M.,
but
it
was
one
of
the
most
enlivening
and
satisfying
moments
I
have
ever
felt.
It
was
as
if
I
had
an
epiphany
--
writing
makes
me
happy.
This
knowledge
was
only
reinforced
my
second
semester,
due
in
part
to
whom
I
consider
to
be
the
greatest
teacher/professor
I
have
ever
encountered.
After
a
semester
of
reading
Milton,
Blake,
and
Speigleman
and
writing
response
papers,
I
learned
writing
is
a
part
of
me,
and
in
turn,
my
writing
reflects
who
I
am.
The
papers
I
write
have
metamorphosed
from
what
the
teacher
wants
to
hear
to
what
I
want
to
say,
and
I
have
even
gone
beyond
writing
only
when
it
assigned.
I
journal
whenever
I
need
to
reflect
on
myself,
my
life,
or
my
emotions;
and
I
write
bits
of
stories
whenever
I
have
moments
of
inspiration.
I
have
come
to
understand
that
every
time
I
begin
to
write
with
my
Bic
clicky
pencils
and
notebook
in
hand
(unless
of
course
I
am
journaling
and
need
my
black
Sharpie
pen)
that
I
have
reflected
upon
a
thought
or
an
idea
and
whatever
I
write
will
somehow
reflect
a
part
of
me
and
my
history
as
a
writer.
