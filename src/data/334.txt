Writing
Like
a
WA
"I'm
working
for
Satan."
Last
year,
that
was
my
favorite
response
to
the
question,
"Which
class
are
you
WA-ing
for?"
Just
to
clarify,
"Satan"
was
the
title
of
my
FYS,
not
my
nickname
for
the
professor.
Quite
the
contrary,
Professor
Rinehart
was
a
thin,
gentle,
soft-spoken
lady
who
exhibited
none
of
the
characteristics
usually
attributed
to
Satan.
At
my
first
meeting
with
Professor
Rinehart,
she
alluded
to
the
fact
that
her
WA
experience
the
previous
year
had
not
been
a
very
positive
one.
Apparently
her
previous
WA
had
repeatedly
missed
appointments
and
had
shown
a
general
lack
of
responsibility.
I
resolved
to
try
to
change
the
bad
impression
Professor
Rinehart
had
initially
gotten
of
the
WA
program
by
being
dedicated
to
helping
her
students.
Because
I
knew
what
to
expect,
my
first
set
of
conferences
last
year
was
much
less
nerve-racking
than
that
of
the
previous
year.
It
was
also
very
similar
in
many
ways.
Both
years,
I
noticed
that
my
students
greatly
underestimated
the
importance
of
reading
the
assignment
several
times
before,
during,
and
after
the
writing
process
in
order
to
make
sure
they
were
completing
what
was
required
of
them.
I
learned
that
a
good
way
to
combat
this
problem
was
to
bring
a
copy
of
the
assignment
to
my
conferences,
read
the
main
components
of
the
assignment
to
the
students,
and
question
them
as
to
whether
their
papers
included
each
aspect.
Last
year,
the
students'
first
assignment
was
to
write
about
an
encounter
with
evil.
After
they
told
their
evil
anecdote,
they
were
to
analyze
it
and
answer
certain
questions
posed
by
the
professor.
Most
of
the
students
completely
skipped
the
analysis
component.
Freshmen
seem
to
have
a
difficult
time
with
thoughtful
analysis
and
compiling
data
to
draw
meaningful
conclusions.
My
work
as
a
WA,
as
well
as
my
everyday
interactions
with
people,
have
taught
me
how
to
ask
pointed
questions
that
cause
people
to
analyze
ideas
and
experiences
and
draw
conclusions
that
burrow
at
least
a
couple
of
feet
beneath
the
surface.
However,
I
certainly
have
not
mastered
the
art
of
asking
good
questions,
and
I
hope
to
continue
to
improve
this
skill,
both
as
a
WA
and
in
my
interpersonal
relationships.
I
had
learned
during
the
previous
year
that
one
of
the
major
keys
to
success
as
a
WA
is
to
establish
credibility
with
the
students
at
the
very
first
conference.
I
take
several
steps
to
accomplish
this
end.
The
first
is
to
read
through
each
paper
very
carefully
and
be
prepared
for
each
conference.
The
students
can
definitely
tell
if
a
WA
is
not
prepared,
and
they
are
much
less
responsive
if
they
detect
this.
I
never
try
to
give
my
students
the
impression
that
I
am
infallible,
but
I
have
learned
that
it
is
important
for
me
to
appear
confident
in
my
ability
as
a
peer
editor.
The
second
step
that
I
take
to
earn
the
students'
trust
is
to
make
it
clear
that
I
truly
care
about
their
success
as
writers,
and
I
do
not
just
think
of
my
conferences
as
arduous
chores
to
be
completed.
Although
it
is
not
required,
I
always
offer
to
meet
more
than
once
with
students
that
are
working
very
hard
but
need
some
extra
help.
A
third
way
I
establish
credibility
is
to
continually
be
conferring
with
their
professor.
When
I
seem
to
have
a
good
understanding
of
what
their
professor
is
looking
for
in
their
writing,
the
students
are
much
more
likely
to
heed
my
advice.
Conveniently,
Professor
Rinehart's
office
was
right
on
the
third
floor
of
Pardee,
so
I
would
often
run
back
and
forth
down
the
hall
in
between
conferences
just
to
make
sure
that
the
advice
I
was
giving
the
students
was
on-target.
I
found
it
somewhat
difficult
to
gage
my
students'
progress
last
year,
partly
because
the
three
papers
that
I
helped
them
with
were
all
of
different
genres.
In
addition,
when
I
met
with
the
students
regarding
their
final
research
paper,
most
of
them
had
only
partially
completed,
very
rough
drafts.
This
was
somewhat
frustrating
to
me,
as
I
like
to
be
able
to
see
how
my
students
have
improved
over
the
semester.
However,
I
was
very
encouraged
when
I
received
a
Christmas
card
from
Professor
Rinehart
thanking
me
for
a
job
well
done.
I
hoped
that
my
diligence
and
commitment
had
both
aided
her
students
as
well
as
possibly
renewed
her
confidence
in
the
WA
program.
Although
my
WA
experience
last
year
taught
me
a
great
deal,
my
greatest
writing
lesson
was
given
to
me
by
Crystalann,
a
fellow
civil
engineer
and
one
of
my
best
friends.
During
the
past
year,
I
and
the
other
members
of
my
civil
engineering
class
delved
into
the
wonderful
world
of
engineering
reports.
I
found
this
genre
of
writing
to
be
challenging
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
usually
done
in
groups.
For
the
shorter
reports,
the
professor
would
usually
expect
the
whole
group
to
gather
around
the
computer
to
help
in
the
writing
process.
I
still
haven't
figured
out
how
this
is
supposed
to
work.
If
I
am
trying
to
write,
and
I
have
people
looking
over
my
shoulder
giving
suggestions,
my
first
instinct
is
to
swat
them
away
as
I
would
an
obnoxious
fly
that
was
buzzing
in
my
ear
and
ruining
my
concentration.
(Fortunately,
I
am
usually
able
to
curb
this
urge
before
any
swatting
occurs!)
I
also
find
it
difficult
to
give
people
suggestions
as
they
are
writing
because
they
usually
know
in
their
mind
where
they
are
headed,
so
any
comments
I
would
make
would
probably
get
them
off
track.
Instead,
I
would
usually
wait
until
the
report
was
done
and
then
read
over
it,
making
any
changes
I
thought
were
necessary.
For
longer
reports,
groups
would
usually
employ
the
"divide-and-conquer"
method,
and
assign
certain
sections
to
each
group
member.
Each
person
would
complete
the
part
of
the
report
for
which
he
or
she
was
responsible,
and
then
come
back
together
and
read
over
what
the
others
had
written
before
putting
all
of
the
parts
together.
This
"peer
editing"
phase
often
proved
to
be
a
good
check
of
our
understanding
of
the
project:
occasionally
a
group
member
would
write
something
that
was
totally
contradictory
to
what
another
member
had
written,
and
the
group
would
have
sit
down
and
figure
out
what
was
right.
But
writing
in
groups
was
a
challenge
for
me
no
matter
which
of
the
two
methods
we
used.
I
am
a
perfectionist,
and
if
I
am
honest
with
myself,
I
have
to
admit
that
I
like
things
to
be
done
in
a
certain
way:
my
way
of
course!
I
found
it
very
difficult
to
have
other
people's
writing
included
in
a
report
that
was
partly
mine.
When
I
read
over
sections
of
the
report
that
others
had
written,
I
found
myself
rewording
many
of
their
sentences
in
a
way
that
was
more
pleasing
to
me
or
seemed
more
clear
to
me.
One
night
when
I
was
working
on
a
group
report
with
my
friends
Crystal
and
Jen,
my
perfectionism
got
a
little
out
of
control.
I
had
read
over
a
section
that
Crystal
had
written,
and
I
had
almost
completely
rewritten
it
in
a
way
that
I
thought
sounded
better
and
made
more
sense.
Upon
noticing
this,
Crystalann,
in
all
her
gentleness
and
wisdom,
spoke
up
and
said,
"Erin,
you
sort
of
like
everything
to
be
done
your
way,
don't
you?
In
a
way
you
almost
wish
you
had
partners
didn't
contribute
anything
so
that
you
could
just
do
the
whole
report
yourself
and
have
it
exactly
the
way
you
like
it."
Wow,
she
really
nailed
that
little
heart
issue
of
mine.
I
didn't
really
say
much
at
the
time;
in
fact
my
reaction
to
my
pride
being
wounded
was
rather
immature:
I
became
quiet
and
somewhat
pouty.
But
when
I
went
home
that
night,
I
wrote
an
e-mail
to
Jen
and
Crystal,
admitting
that
Crystal
was
right
and
apologizing
to
both
of
them
for
my
behavior.
At
that
point
I
started
to
think
about
when
it
was
appropriate
to
change
a
partner's
writing
and
when
it
was
better
to
leave
it
alone.
It's
difficult
because
I
think
writing
does
come
more
naturally
to
me
than
to
most
of
my
engineering
friends.
I
am
also
more
willing
to
read
through
a
paper
slowly
and
take
a
long
time
revising.
(I
guess
that's
why
I'm
a
WA!)
Knowing
that
I'm
a
WA,
my
friends
usually
do
ask
me
to
revise
and
edit
their
sections
of
the
report.
However,
"revise
and
edit"
does
not
mean,
"rewrite."
I
started
thinking
seriously
about
whether
the
changes
I
had
made
were
merely
stylistic
or
whether
they
were
actually
necessary.
Had
I
begun
to
believe
that
I
was
always
right
about
writing?
Had
I
fooled
myself
into
believing
that
I
could
write
better
than
any
of
my
fellow
civil
engineers?
Could
it
be
that
I
had
become
so
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
my
own
style
of
writing
that
I
rejected
the
styles
of
my
colleagues?
These
were
difficult
questions
to
ponder
because
I
had
a
sneaking
suspicion
that
the
answers
were
yes,
at
least
partially.
I
also
started
thinking
about
whether
such
thoughts
had
affected
my
work
as
a
WA.
I
decided
that
for
the
most
part,
this
was
not
a
problem
in
my
WA
work.
The
main
reason
is
the
fact
that
my
name
is
not
on
my
students'
papers,
so
I
don't
feel
as
though
their
papers
are
extensions
of
myself,
the
way
I
do
with
group
engineering
reports.
In
addition,
I
usually
spend
most
of
my
WA
conferences
focusing
on
"higher
order
concerns",
so
I
don't
even
have
a
chance
to
try
to
impose
my
writing
style
upon
my
students.
But
this
prideful
attitude
is
definitely
something
that
I
will
watch
out
for,
now
that
I
have
recognized
my
tendency
towards
it.
I
also
think
it
would
behoove
all
WA's
to
consider
whether
or
not
such
feelings
of
superiority
are
lurking
in
their
minds
as
well.
It
is
a
great
tribute
the
Writing
Program's
success
that
a
WA's
expertise
is
readily
acknowledged
by
Lafayette
professors
and
students
alike;
however,
I
think
we
must
be
wary
of
letting
this
esteem
fuel
our
self-righteousness.
While
most
of
my
writing
endeavors
during
the
past
year
were
engineering
reports,
I
did
have
some
opportunity
to
dabble
in
other
genres.
I
took
Government
101,
and
each
of
our
three
exams
consisted
of
two
take-home
essays
which
could
not
exceed
a
total
of
five
typed
pages.
These
papers
were
a
challenge
for
me,
as
my
knowledge
of
the
workings
of
the
U.S.
government
is
rather
meager.
According
to
my
professor,
we
were
supposed
to
be
able
to
complete
the
essays
using
only
the
information
presented
in
the
lectures
and
the
textbook;
however
I
often
felt
very
unsure
about
the
factual
correctness
of
what
I
was
writing.
Sometimes
I
would
also
"think
too
hard",
and
end
up
drawing
some
crazy
conclusions
that
my
professor
sort
of
gently
rejected.
For
example,
on
my
first
exam,
I
wrote
an
essay
based
on
the
somewhat
unorthodox
thesis
that
the
federal
government's
increased
power
should
be
considered
undesirable
because
of
the
selfish
motives
that
characterize
nearly
all
of
its
decision
making.
I
argued
that
this
is
true
even
when
the
government's
selfish
actions
end
up
bringing
about
positive
change
for
its
constituents.
My
professor's
major
criticism
of
the
essay
was
that
my
perspective
raised
several
questions
that
I
did
not
address.
Her
criticism
was
accurate,
but
I
was
discouraged
because
my
efforts
to
think
critically
and
go
against
the
status
quo
had
only
succeeded
in
making
my
thesis
defense
more
complicated
and
almost
impossible
to
achieve
in
a
two-and-a-half-page
essay
that
I
only
had
a
week
to
complete.
On
my
second
essay
exam,
I
again
took
an
unpopular
position;
this
time
I
argued
that
there
are
realistically
no
concrete
reasons
to
be
concerned
that
so
many
people
choose
not
to
exercise
their
freedom
of
suffrage.
Again,
my
professor
pointed
out
several
areas
in
which
I
had
failed
to
address
all
of
the
"what
ifs"
that
she
thought
naturally
followed
from
the
proposition
I
had
made.
I
found
this
rather
frustrating.
It
would
have
been
so
much
easier
to
just
take
the
position
that
it
is
important
for
all
American
citizens
to
vote.
Properly
defending
my
position
would
have
likely
required
fairly
extensive
research
and
some
additional
time
to
think
and
write.
I
have
noticed
similar
frustrations
among
the
students
with
whom
I
work
in
the
WA
program.
Many
students
understand
that
a
thesis
should
involve
some
critical
thinking
and
should
not
be
a
conclusion
that
could
be
easily
proven
by
a
well-trained
monkey.
In
an
effort
to
avoid
an
"obvious"
thesis,
many
students
end
up
trying
to
prove
a
thesis
for
which
there
just
isn't
enough
evidence.
When
I
read
a
paper
of
this
variety,
it
seems
so
obvious
to
me
that
the
student's
thesis
is
sort
of
"out
there"
and
that
he
has
left
the
reader
with
many
unanswered
questions.
However,
often
the
student
has
been
mulling
over
the
paper
for
hours
and
has
become
convinced
that
his
thesis
is
true.
The
student
may
have
even
become
somewhat
emotionally
attached
to
his
thesis,
as
I
did
in
the
first
essay
mentioned
above.
My
professor
recognized
this
and
described
my
essay
as
"impassioned".
One
result
of
my
"passion"
was
that
I
became
so
focused
on
proving
my
thesis
that
I
glossed
over
questions
I
could
not
answer
or
facts
that
seemed
contradictory
to
the
point
I
was
trying
to
prove.
This
was
a
good
reminder
to
me
of
the
fact
that
often
the
most
difficult
aspect
of
writing
is
not
choosing
the
right
words
to
make
one's
ideas
understood;
more
frequently,
students
struggle
with
the
ideas
themselves.
However,
my
experience
has
been
that
students
kick
and
scream
-
in
a
quiet,
non-violent
sort
of
way
-
when
they
are
asked
questions
that
cause
them
to
think
about
the
ideas
that
were
the
framework
for
their
paper.
They
feel
as
though
they
are
moving
backward
instead
of
forward,
and
they
are
desperately
afraid
that
their
ideas
will
be
proven
wrong.
As
a
WA,
I
find
that
one
of
the
most
difficult
aspects
of
my
job
is
to
delve
into
these
questions
that
students
would
rather
not
be
asked.
However,
my
experience
in
Government
101
has
given
me
a
renewed
sense
of
the
importance
of
challenging
students'
ideas,
while
also
giving
me
a
heightened
ability
to
identify
and
empathize
with
their
struggles.
Although
I
have
met
with
some
frustration
in
my
writing
during
the
past
year,
I
have
learned
a
great
deal
from
my
toil.
In
the
coming
year,
I
hope
to
continue
to
improve
upon
the
art
of
asking
excellent
questions
to
draw
out
writer's
ideas
and
help
them
to
think
critically.
I
also
hope
to
curb
some
of
the
pride
that
has
cropped
up
as
a
result
of
receiving
praise
for
my
writing
ability.
In
civil
engineering
group
reports,
I
will
endeavor
to
read
the
writing
of
group
members
with
an
appreciation
for
the
unique
style
of
each
member,
and
I
will
attempt
to
correct
only
those
sentences
that
are
clearly
incorrect
or
difficult
to
understand.
I
will
continue
to
try
to
improve
my
ability
to
write
well-supported
thesis
papers,
and
I
will
help
my
students
to
do
the
same.
I
hope
to
make
the
most
of
this,
my
last
semester
as
a
WA,
by
helping
much
and
learning
even
more.
