Personal
Narrative
My
History
As
a
Writer
My
first
experience
as
a
writer
(that
I
recall)
took
place
at
the
age
of
five,
when
I
was
in
Kindergarten.
My
Kindergarten
teachers,
Mrs.
Balash
and
Mrs.
Sampson,
decided
to
started
my
class
out
slowly
on
the
first
day
by
having
us
practice
our
handwriting
by
writing
our
name
several
times.
This
assignment
seems
to
be
a
simple
enough
task,
and
for
most
of
my
class
it
was
quite
easy
as
my
classmates
had
last
names
such
as
Clark,
Kahn,
and
Katz.
When
I
was
confronted
with
this
assignment,
I
was
overwhelmed
by
the
length
of
my
last
name,
and
was
unwilling
to
even
attempt
to
write
it.
As
my
peers
were
completing
this
assignment,
my
teachers
walked
around
the
room,
checking
on
our
progress.
I
believe
that
it
was
Mrs.
Sampson
who
got
to
me
first,
and
asked
the
obvious
question:
"Scott,
why
haven't
you
written
your
name?"
I
responded
to
Mrs.
Sampson
not
be
answering
her
question,
but
by
asking
my
own
question.
I
said,
"Mrs.
Sampson,
would
you
write
my
name
for
me?"
Mrs.
Sampson
did
grudgingly
write
my
name
for
me
that
day,
probably
because
I
was
a
couple
of
moments
away
from
bursting
into
tears,
yet
she
did
have
some
sage
words
of
advice
for
me.
She
said,
"Scott,
your
name
might
seem
long,
but
it
is
just
two
short
words.
If
you
learn
how
to
spell
'feather'
and
'man',
than
you
can
spell
your
last
name."
After
that
day,
I
had
little
problems
spelling
my
name.
Mrs.
Sampson
instilled
in
me
the
confidence
to
realize
that
any
academic
task,
especially
writing,
may
seem
overwhelming
at
first,
but
can
be
accomplished
with
hard
work.
Of
course,
I
didn't
realize
the
importance
of
the
lesson
when
I
was
five
years
old.
I
was
too
busy
calling
Mrs.
Sampson
back
to
write
my
name
again
because
my
handwriting
looked
like
Egyptian
hieroglyphics.
Unfortunately,
handwriting
was
a
subject
at
which
I
never
improved
After
that
experience,
writing
was
not
a
big
part
of
my
life
for
the
subsequent
five
years.
During
those
years,
my
elementary
teachers
concentrated
mostly
on
math
and
science,
and
for
the
most
part
writing
went
by
the
wayside.
This
trend
ended
in
sixth
grade,
with
my
teacher
Mrs.
Spallone.
She
told
us
the
first
day
of
school
to
bring
in
a
notebook,
because
each
day
she
would
give
us
fifteen
minutes
to
write
in
our
"journal"
about
our
experiences
and
our
reflections
on
what
we
were
experiencing.
Mrs.
Spallone
explained
to
my
class
that
we
should
not
censor
anything
we
write
in
this
journal,
as
she
would
never
read
from
it.
Despite
her
assurances,
I
was
still
skeptical,
so
I
only
wrote
about
uncontroversial
subjects
in
my
journal,
such
as
schoolwork
and
sports.
As
the
year
went
on,
however,
I
became
confident
that
the
journal
was
secure
from
others,
and
I
became
more
comfortable,
and
began
to
write
about
my
true
feelings
on
many
subjects.
In
that
journal,
I
discovered
my
true
feelings
on
many
subjects,
including
my
self
image,
my
relationships
with
friends
and
family,
and
my
growing
understanding
of
world
around
me.
It
was
through
this
experience
of
writing
in
a
journal
that
I
learned
that
there
are
many
things
that
are
much
more
easily
written
than
said.
It
was
then
that
I
learned
that
writing,
for
me,
is
the
best
means
to
achieve
a
better
understanding
of
who
I
am.
The
next
formative
experience
I
had
that
involved
writing
took
place
the
following
year
in
Junior
High
School.
I
was
in
an
Honors
English
class
taught
by
Mrs.
Homuth,
which
concentrated
heavily
on
the
structure
of
writing.
In
this
class,
I
learned
about
many
forms
of
writing,
such
as
exposition,
opinion
papers,
compare/contrast
papers,
and
research
papers.
Many
of
the
ideas
learned
in
this
class
such
as
creating
a
thesis,
substantiating
support
for
a
point
made
in
a
paper,
and
effectively
writing
an
interesting
conclusion
are
building
blocks
of
writing
which
I
still
use
to
this
day.
What
made
this
class
distinctive,
however,
was
the
fact
that
Mrs.
Homuth
honored
those
who
wrote
particularly
good
papers
by
making
the
papers
into
overhead
sheets,
to
be
shown
to
my
English
honors
class,
and
to
future
honors
classes.
All
year,
I
strived
to
be
the
student
whose
paper
was
honored,
yet
due
to
the
fine
writing
of
my
peers,
none
of
my
papers
were
ever
honored.
Finally,
in
June,
my
class
was
give
our
last
assignment-
a
comparison
paragraph.
In
an
effort
to
finally
make
the
overhead
projector,
I
unwisely
decided
to
tackle
the
weighty
subject
of
comparing
the
musical
groups
Guns
'N
Roses
and
Public
Enemy.
Even
though
I
was
handicapped
by
such
an
insipid
topic,
I
worked
for
an
entire
weekend
on
writing
what
I
thought
was
a
perfect
paper,
and
the
following
week
I
was
shocked
to
discover
that
Mrs.
Homuth
chose
my
paper
as
the
paper
to
be
honored.
As
she
showed
my
paper
to
the
rest
of
my
class,
I
was
overwhelmed
with
a
feeling
of
pride,
and
an
understanding
of
what
a
sense
of
accomplishment
can
be
gained
through
good
writing.
Luckily,
these
feelings
overwhelmed
the
feeling
of
horror
I
should
have
had
due
to
the
fact
that
future
students
would
be
reading
a
paper
about
Guns
'N
Roses
with
my
name
attached
to
it.
My
subsequent
three
years
of
school
provided
me
with
additional
background
and
practice
that
made
me
a
better
writer.
These
years,
however,
proved
to
be
relatively
unfulfilling
for
me
as
a
writer.
I
had
a
series
of
competent
yet
pedestrian
teachers
whose
uncreative
assignments
made
writing
a
chore.
I
found
myself
just
going
through
the
motions
of
writing
papers,
and
I
found
my
only
motivating
factor
to
write
was
to
get
good
grades.
Then
in
11th
grade,
along
came
Mr.
Odum,
a
teacher
whose
style
completely
differed
from
that
of
my
previous
three
teachers.
He
was
a
man
who
had
a
great
impact
on
my
life
as
a
writer.
Mr.
Odum
was
such
a
good
teacher
because
like
Mrs.
Spallone,
my
sixth
grade
teacher,
he
allowed
my
class
to
write
about
things
that
were
important
and
interesting
in
our
lives,
while
still
sticking
to
the
curriculum.
In
Mr.
Odum's
class,
we
regularly
had
five-minute
"reaction"
papers
to
an
array
of
things
such
as
movies,
guest
speakers,
or
just
how
we
were
feeling
that
day.
Though
these
assignments
seemed
to
be
easy
and
uncomplicated,
they
were
teaching
the
class
important
lesson
about
writing.
This
lesson
is
that
writing,
whether
a
half
page
reaction
or
a
twenty-page
essay,
has
to
come
from
ideas
that
you
believe
in,
and
things
that
are
is
important
to
you.
This
lesson
was
especially
important
to
me
because
my
writing
had
been
very
impersonal
since
my
journal
entries
of
6th
grade.
My
motivation
to
excel
when
doing
an
assignment
was
to
get
good
grades,
and
that
often
meant
writing
things
that
I
didn't
believe
in
or
care
about.
This
trend
ended
when
I
joined
Mr.
Odum's
class.
Since
I
knew
he
cared
about
my
success
as
a
writer,
I
often
asked
him
for
his
assistance
on
a
paper
outside
of
class
time.
On
several
occasions
I
remember
going
to
Mr.
Odum
to
get
advice
and
I
would
present
him
with
my
initial
thesis.
Before
he
would
give
me
any
advice,
Mr.
Odum
would
ask
me
a
simple
question,
"Scott,
do
your
really
believe
what
you
are
saying?"
I
learned
from
his
advice
that
to
be
a
good
writer,
you
need
to
be
a
good
thinker,
along
with
being
a
good
writer
stylistically.
In
Mr.
Odum's
class,
I
began
to
truly
take
pride
in
my
writing,
due
to
his
nurturing
environment.
Due
to
his
encouragement,
and
all
the
time
he
spent
with
me
in
the
pre-writing
process,
I
felt
that
I
could
not
let
him
down
by
writing
a
sub-par
paper.
I
can
remember
my
final
writing
assignment,
an
11-page
paper,
in
which
I
compared
"Catcher
in
the
Rye"
by
J.D.
Sallinger,
"Babbitt"
by
Sinclair
Lewis,
and
"Red
Badge
of
Courage"
by
Stephen
Crane.
For
this
paper,
I
spent
72
consecutive
hours
either
writing
the
paper,
or
sleeping,
and
by
the
end
of
it,
I
felt
it
could
not
possibly
be
improved.
When
I
handed
in
that
paper,
I
was
truly
proud
of
what
I
had
accomplished,
and
I
realized
that
I
did
not
what
grade
I
would
get.
In
fact,
I
do
not
think
I
even
found
out
what
I
got
on
the
paper.
The
real
lesson
I
learned
from
that
paper
was
that
when
I
write
I
should
not
worry
about
letting
a
teacher
down
with
my
effort.
The
true
person
I
should
worry
about
letting
down
is
myself.
Writing,
in
many
ways,
is
a
very
good
reflector
of
a
person's
personality,
and
putting
forth
a
complete
effort
has
became
a
regular
occurrence
whenever
I
write
a
paper
now.
The
next
formati
ve
experience
in
my
writing
career
following
11th
grade
took
place
when
I
came
to
college.
My
first-year
seminar
was
concentrated
on
the
study
of
high
and
low
culture
and
concentrated
heavily
on
writing
papers.
The
first
assignment
I
had
in
this
class
was
discussing
the
differences
between
the
book
and
the
movie
"Romeo
and
Juliet".
Since
this
paper
was
the
first
one
I
wrote
in
college,
I
wanted
to
get
off
on
the
right
foot,
so
I
put
a
great
deal
of
thought,
energy,
and
time
into
it.
After
two
drafts,
I
thought
that
the
paper
was
the
best
I
had
ever
written.
I
was
pleased,
therefore,
when
before
class,
my
professor
stopped
me
in
the
hallway,
and
told
me
how
much
she
had
liked
the
paper,
and
that
she
wanted
to
show
it
to
the
class.
I
was
quite
happy
with
my
progress
since
high
school,
and
I
felt
that
the
two
other
paper
I
wrote
in
the
seminar
were
as
good
as
the
first.
Due
to
the
praise
I
was
receiving,
I
finally
believed
that
I
was
a
"good"
writer.
Then,
the
following
semester,
I
had
another
English
class,
called
"Literary
Questions".
The
first
paper
I
wrote,
a
study
of
"King
Lear"
was
done
hastily
one
Sunday
evening,
in
the
midst
of
studying
for
a
test.
I
expected
that
I
would
give
it
to
my
WA,
listen
to
him
say
it
was
not
good,
and
then
make
the
necessary
changes
before
I
handed
it
in.
To
my
shock,
the
WA
loved
my
paper.
He
told
me
that
it
was
by
far
the
best
he
had
read,
and
I
should
not
change
it
at
all.
This
meeting
prompted
to
re-evaluate
my
perception
of
myself
as
a
writer.
I
had
thought
that
the
draft
was
extremely
basic,
yet
a
skilled
writer
had
thought
it
worthy
of
such
praise.
I
realized
then
that
it
is
quite
easy
to
please
others
with
writing,
but
it
is
hard
to
please
yourself.
I
realized
that
I
could
probably
hand
in
that
draft
and
get
a
decent
grade,
or
I
could
kill
myself,
and
write
several
more
drafts,
and
still
not
be
pleased
with
my
work.
Of
course,
I
chose
the
second
option.
In
college,
I
realized
that
although
outside
praise
is
fun
to
listen
to,
it
can
be
detrimental
to
one's
progress
as
a
writer.
Getting
good
grades
and
receiving
praise
nearly
led
me
to
rest
on
my
laurels,
and
I
nearly
handed
in
work
that
I
did
not
believe
was
good.
Although
I
have
made
considerable
progress
in
my
writing
since
I
have
come
to
Lafayette,
I
still
have
an
amazing
amount
of
work
to
do
before
I
become
a
good
writer,
and
hard
work
has
to
be
done
on
any
paper
if
it
will
be
good.
Through
this
journey
of
my
writing
career,
many
lessons
have
been
learned
which
can
be
applied
to
any
writer's
career.
Obviously,
writing
is
a
craft
that
needs
basic
skills
such
as
grammar
and
vocabulary
to
be
good.
Other
less
tangible
qualities,
such
as
confidence
and
encouragement,
however,
may
be
just
as
or
more
important
for
a
person
to
be
a
good
writer.
My
life
has
seen
many
cycles
of
writing,
meaning
times
when
I
was
interested
in
writing
good
papers,
and
times
when
my
interest
in
writing
waned.
The
one
correlation
I
can
see
is
that
when
I
had
teachers
who
cared,
I
cared
about
writing.
In
my
second
semester
of
college,
I
think
I
realized
that
I
need
to
be
able
to
be
a
self-motivator
if
my
writing
will
continue
to
improve.
Most
of
all,
I
think
that
I
have
learned
that
just
at
the
moment
when
I
think
I
have
a
handle
on
being
a
good
writer,
I
then
learn
how
far
I
really
have
to
go.
