Writing
Like
a
WA
Project
for
Workshop
August
27
Fall
1999
"Hi,
how
are
you
today?"
"Fine."
"Any
questions
you
have
in
particular
about
your
paper?"
"Nope."
"Okay,
well
let's
get
started
then..."
As
I
begin
my
conference
with
your
average
freshman,
this-is-my-first-college-paper,
I
pay
close
attention
to
the
student's
response...or
lack
thereof.
The
paper
is
a
prime
example
of
what
we
learned
in
"WA
training."
It's
got
really
great
points,
they
just
aren't
supported.
It's
got
some
excellent
vocabulary,
just
terribly
unorganized.
It's
got
your
first
person,
subject-verb
disagreement,
and
each
paragraph
starts
off
with
the
phrase
"Another
example
of
this
is...".
All
of
these
are
very
easy
matters
to
address
and
fix;
however
if
the
student
does
not
share
your
interest
in
making
this
the
best
paper
ever,
it's
going
to
be
a
tough
conference.
I
start
by
shaping
a
thesis
with
the
student,
with
the
hopes
of
turning
the
essay
into
a
standard,
introduction-thesis-supported
points-conclusion
masterpiece.
I
ask
the
student
to
tell
me
a
little
about
the
assignment
and
what
exactly
the
point
of
the
paper
is.
I
ask
how
this
point
could
be
developed
more,
and
how
that
point
could
be
summarized
into
one
paragraph
instead
of
four.
After
a
number
of
short,
one
word
responses,
I
reach
the
conclusion
of
my
conference.
As
I
ramble
on
for
a
few
more
moments,
I
look
deep
into
the
student's
eyes.
There
is
a
dull
gaze
there
that
is
unnerving
to
me.
Hasn't
this
student
been
listening
to
a
word
I've
said?
Has
anything
sunk
in?
"Did
you
have
any
last
questions
about
anything
I
didn't
cover?"
"Nope."
"Well,
good
luck,
If
you
need
anything,
just
call."
"Yeah,
see
ya."
This
is
just
an
example
of
a
WA
conference
from
you
know
where.
Of
course,
not
every
conference
is
like
this.
In
fact,
most
of
my
conferences
over
the
past
year
of
being
a
Writing
Associate
have
gone
beautifully.
The
student
walks
out
the
door
with
a
grin
of
confidence,
and
I
feel
fulfilled
that
I
have
aided
in
this
feeling.
However,
it
is
both
types
of
conferences,
and
all
the
ones
in
between,
that
have
made
being
a
WA
such
a
powerful
learning
experience
for
me.
Not
only
have
I
gained
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
I
have
made
a
student
feel
better
about
their
work,
but
I
have
also
gained
a
new
sense
and
outlook
of
my
own
writing.
I
realized
this
year
that
the
perfect
paper
does
not
have
to
follow
the
standard
format,
necessarily.
I
realized
that
there
is
more
to
good
writing
than
following
the
rules,
and
using
good
grammar.
Throughout
the
year,
after
having
many
conferences
with
my
students,
thus
exposing
me
to
so
many
different
types
of
writing,
I
could
see
my
own
writing
style
changing.
I
began
to
include
or
not
include
things
that
I
found
in
other
student's
papers.
I
began
to
follow
some
of
my
own
advice
("Revise!
Revise!
Revise!"),
and
learned
the
importance
of
having
someone
else
read
my
papers,
even
though
I
am
a
WA.
Perhaps
the
most
powerful
realization
I
formed
this
year
after
being
a
WA
was
that
not
only
do
I
give
to
the
student,
but
also
the
student
gives
to
me.
I
remember
when
I
first
learned
to
write
a
"good
essay."
I
was
in
seventh
grade
and
my
English
teacher
taught
us
about
the
5-paragraph
essay
format.
You
start
with
an
introduction
where
the
last
sentence
should
be
a
thesis
sentence
that
states
the
three
or
four
points
you
are
going
to
discuss
in
the
body
of
your
paper.
These
points
should
be
in
the
order
that
you
are
going
to
discuss
them,
and
the
sentence
needs
to
be
strong
and
straightforward.
From
there,
you
write
the
body
of
your
paper,
developing
each
point
in
its
own
paragraph,
and
then
sum
it
all
up
in
a
powerful
conclusion.
I
remember
loving
this
format
and
thinking
that
I
could
write
an
essay
on
anything
now
that
I
had
this
structure
to
follow.
As
the
years
went
by,
I
found
myself
loving
to
write
more
and
more.
It
became
a
part
of
me,
as
I
took
more
advanced
English
classes,
and
eventually
Journalism.
Even
though
I
was
writing
all
sorts
of
different
papers,
whether
they
be
journalistic
or
creative,
I
always
found
myself
referring
to
the
5
paragraph
essay
structure.
It
was
like
my
safe
guard.
I
knew
if
I
followed
this
pattern,
I
couldn't
go
wrong.
When
I
got
to
college
and
began
writing
college
level
papers,
I
depended
on
my
format
again.
My
conferences
with
my
WA
always
went
well
and
I
was
always
satisfied
with
my
work.
It
wasn't
until
I
became
I
WA
myself
that
my
writing
style
began
to
change.
After
several
conferences
with
my
students,
I
came
to
see
just
how
varied
student
writing
could
be.
When
I
sat
down
with
the
student,
I
found
myself
trying
to
transform
his
or
her
paper
into
a
paper
I
would
create.
I
would
rearrange
the
thesis
and
then
make
sure
each
paragraph
followed.
After
several
more
meeting
with
students,
however,
I
realized
that
some
of
the
different
writing
styles
should
be
left
alone.
Some
students
have
their
own,
creative
styles
and
do
not
need
the
format
on
which
I
depend.
What
I
realized
is
that
as
long
as
the
paper
has
a
point
and
it
is
supported,
the
student's
own
creative
approach
to
the
topic
should
be
commended.
Another
lesson
I
learned
this
year
through
my
students
was
the
importance
of
revision.
Coming
from
a
strong
journalistic
background,
I
have
always
had
it
driven
into
my
head
that
revising
a
paper
two
or
three
times
is
absolutely
necessary.
However,
when
I
sit
down
to
write
a
paper,
I
spend
hours
just
on
the
introduction
because
I
want
to
get
it
just
right.
Once
I
am
finished
my
paper,
I
go
back
and
read
it
over
and
am
usually
satisfied
with
my
product.
After
peer
revision,
I
usually
have
trouble
changing
anything.
When
I
am
in
my
conferences
though,
the
number
one
tip
I
give
students
is
to
revise,
revise,
and
revise.
What
I
saw
last
year
when
I
met
with
my
students
a
second
time,
was
the
amazing
improvement
from
the
first
draft
to
the
second.
I
thought
I
should
follow
my
own
advice
and
put
just
as
much
time
and
effort
into
revision
of
my
own
papers.
This
is
something
I
plan
to
concentrate
on
more
this
coming
year.
The
last
major
lesson
I
have
learned
in
just
one
year
of
being
a
WA
is
plain
and
simple.
There
are
better
writers
than
me.
Yes,
they
may
even
be
freshman.
I
witnessed
this
both
fall
and
spring
semester
last
year.
With
each
class,
there
was
at
least
one
student
who
had
what
I
considered
a
"perfect
paper."
This
was
always
difficult
for
me
because
I
never
knew
quite
how
to
handle
these
conferences.
I
would
commend
the
student
on
their
paper
and
tell
them
they
were
talented
writers.
I
even
suggested
to
one
student
that
she
consider
applying
to
be
a
WA.
However,
no
matter
how
"good"
I
thought
a
paper
was,
there
was
always
something
to
improve.
This
helped
me
in
my
own
writing
because
now,
no
matter
how
well
I
think
I
write
a
paper,
I
know
that
it
is
not
going
to
be
perfect.
I
learned
not
to
expect
a
high
grade
just
because
I
think
I
am
a
good
writer.
Aside
from
all
that
I
have
learned
from
my
students
last
year,
being
a
WA
also
changed
the
way
other
viewed
me.
When
I
became
a
WA,
suddenly
all
my
peers
were
coming
to
me
with
their
papers
or
just
simple
questions
about
grammar.
People's
expectations
of
me
were
higher.
I
enjoyed
the
new
respect
I
received
from
my
peers.
However,
being
known
as
a
WA
in
my
English
courses
was
a
little
scary.
I
felt
that
maybe
my
professor
expected
more
out
of
my
writing
since
I
was
a
WA
now.
I
remember
the
first
time
we
did
peer
revision
in
my
18th
Century
Fiction
class,
and
I
felt
as
if
I
needed
to
revise
up
to
some
certain
standard.
These
worries
faded
fast
though,
especially
after
my
professor
asked
me
if
I
considered
being
a
WA.
I
told
him
with
a
smile,
"I
already
am."
It
is
comments
like
that
and
the
respect
from
my
peers
that
make
me
feel
really
good
about
my
job.
Not
only
do
I
love
being
a
WA
because
I
get
the
chance
to
read
other
student's
writing,
but
also
because
I
have
become
known
for
what
I
love.
I
love
having
my
name
associated
with
anything
that
has
to
do
with
writing.
Over
the
summer,
I
have
kept
up
with
my
writing
as
much
as
I
can.
I
attempted
what
I
have
always
wanted
to
do
-
my
novel.
Although
I
haven't
completed
it
yet,
I
have
definitely
made
some
progress
and
hope
to
continue
it
throughout
the
school
year.
I
have
also
been
thinking
a
lot
about
how
I
am
going
to
approach
my
students
this
year.
I
feel
I
am
more
experienced
and
prepared
now
to
have
successful
conferences.
I
now
have
the
knowledge
that
all
student
writers
are
different,
have
different
styles,
goals,
and
even
priorities.
I
have
learned
to
keep
in
mind
that
not
every
student
loves
writing
as
I
do,
and
will
not
think
that
a
conference
with
me
is
all
that
important.
I
need
to
remember
to
let
the
student
do
the
talking,
to
find
out
what
he
or
she
thinks
about
the
paper.
This
is
the
only
way
the
paper
will
be
improved
without
losing
the
student's
personal
style.
This
is
the
advice
I
give
myself,
as
well
as
all
new
WA's.
The
new
WA's
need
to
know
that
being
a
WA
is
so
much
more
than
just
a
job
at
school.
It
is
about
learning
from
your
students,
learning
from
your
professor,
learning
from
other
WA's,
and
learning
from
yourself.
The
experience
will
teach
you
so
much
about
yourself
and
you
will
find
a
new
respect
for
the
writing
of
others.
Another
piece
of
advice
I
find
extremely
important
to
the
new
WA's
is
not
to
forget
the
professors.
Never
hesitate
to
go
to
a
professor
in
the
WA
program
or
the
professor
you
a
working
for,
for
help
or
advice.
They
are
the
people
who
know
best
and
will
offer
you
the
most.
It
is
important
to
speak
with
your
WA
professor
regularly
so
you
know
what
he
or
she
wants
and
expects
of
his
class.
Also,
other
WA's
are
great
to
speak
to
about
work.
They
know
first
hand
what
goes
on
in
conferences
and
can
be
very
beneficial
to
you.
Personally,
I
am
looking
forward
to
another
successful
and
exciting
year
of
being
a
WA,
and
I
know
my
learning
will
continue
with
each
and
every
conference.
