WA:
My
Writing
Process
August
31,
1995
WA
Workshop
Just
as
the
first
words
we
speak
are
incomprehensible,
the
first
words
I
wrote
were
unreadable.
I
suppose
you
can't
even
really
call
them
words
-just
scribble.
But
scribbling
is
how
ray
writing
began.
Once
I
achieved
hand
to
pencil
coordination,
the
ABCs
began
to
take
shape.
Then
the
ABCs
linked
together
to
form
individual
words,
and
the
words
linked
together
to
make
sentences,
sentences
to
make
paragraphs,
paragraphs
to
make
papers.
But,
I
realized
writing
is
not
as
easy
as
linking
a
set
of
Lego
blocks
together.
There
is
alot
of
construction
and
destruction
that
occurs
before
it
is
over.
Not
until
I
learned
to
build,
tear
down,
repair,
and
build
again,
did
I
learn
to
let
these
words
take
the
shape
of
my
ideas.
My
earliest
memory
of
writing
comes
from
Inglewood
Elementary
School.
For
one
month,
the
third
grade
wing
of
Inglewood
was
a
mock-post
office.
It
was
a
practical
lesson
in
formal
letter
writing.
Mrs.
King,
my
beloved
third
grade
teacher,
used
an
overhead
projector
to
show
us
where
to
put
the
greeting,
the
return
address,
and
the
closing
and
how
to
address
the
envelope.
There
was
a
specific
format
to
follow
for
business
letters
and
personal
letters.
This
format
became
the
skeleton,
and
we
filled
it
in
with
our
news
to
friends
or
concerns
to
fake
companies.
The
structure
of
the
letter
was
always
the
same,
and
once
I
memorized
where
to
begin
the
greeting,
sign
the
closing,
and
put
the
return
address,
I
could
write
a
letter.
But
this
did
not
make
me
a
writer
just
yet.
At
this
point,
I
was
only
concerned
with
structure
and
appearance
not
content.
Because,
in
the
third
grade
writing
meant
copying,
I
did
not
understand
terms
like
sentence
or
paragraph.
I
did
not
know
there
were
any
rules
to
follow.
When
I
first
copied
a
paragraph
from
the
overhead
screen,
I
wrote
one
sentence
on
every
line
to
make
it
look
more
organized
and
structured.
I
thought
at
the
end
of
a
line,
a
sentence
had
to
be
punctuated
so
if
there
was
not
enough
room
in
that
line
to
finish
a
sentence,
I
started
a
new
line.
But
then,
Mrs.
King
told
me
that
my
paragraph
was
now
only
a
list
of
sentences
each
separate
and
alone.
So,
in
the
third
grade
a
paragraph
meant
keeping
the
sentences
together
in
a
group.
Obviously,
I
had
a
lot
to
learn
about
grammar.
Yet,
in
elementary
school
making
sure
you
improved
your
handwriting
was
more
important,
and
grammar
was
as
simple
as:
a
noun
and
a
verb
make
a
sentence.
Any
writing
assignments
took
the
form
of
questions
and
answers.
Book
reports
followed
an
outline
given
by
the
teacher,
and
each
paragraph
seemed
only
to
answer
each
given
question.
More
importantly,
the
teacher's
focus
was
on
getting
you
to
write
just
about
anything.
My
first
collection
of
writing
consisted
of
personal
stories
about
different
topics
such
as
family,
pets,
siblings,
and
hobbies.
It
certainly
was
not
a
coherent
literary
masterpiece,
but
is
was
the
beginning
of
my
writing
career.
For
the
first
few
formative
years
in
high
school,
grammar
and
rules
were
the
emphasis.
It
was
important
to
build
a
foundation
before
I
could
learn
to
build
a
paragraph
properly.
Like
many
other
junior
high
students,
I
had
a
dislike
for
grammar,
and
diagraming
sentences
was
worse
than
detention.
Once
I
knew
what
pieces
made-up
a
sentence
and
the
proper
English
term
for
each
piece,
the
next
step
was
to
learn
to
manipulate
these
various
pieces
in
my
writing.
This
is
where
my
writing
process
began.
While
in
the
ninth-grade,
I
associated
writing
with
research.
Formal
term
papers
in
my
American
government
class
consisted
of
first,
extensive
note-taking
on
a
designated
topic.
Most
notes
were
taken
on
3x5
notecards
with
page
references
and
proper
documentation.
When
the
time
came
to
write
the
paper,
it
was
only
a
matter
of
putting
the
cards
in
the
order
the
paragraphs
were
to
appear
-a
very
systematic
process
of
writing.
These
rigid
boundaries
of
research
kept
my
writing
focused.
The
safety
I
felt
in
elementary
school
was
replicated
once
again
with
this
structured
form
of
writing.
The
teacher
seemed
to
dictate
how
and
what
I
was
to
write.
The
steps
to
follow
were
easy:
1.
take
notes
on
notecards
2.
outline
3.
arrange
notecards
according
to
outline
4.
follow
outline
and
notecards
and
begin
to
write
5.
proofread
I
enjoyed
this
research-oriented
writing.
The
methodical
process
helped
me
to
organize
my
thought
process.
However,
such
a
straightforward
process
left
little
to
no
room
for
drafting.
Thus,
began
my
obsession
with
perfection
even
before
completion.
Drafting
was
an
oblivious
word
to
me
as
a
writer
in
high
school.
A
rough
draft
only
meant
it
was
in
pencil
and
handwritten
on
every
other
line
on
one
side
of
the
page.
To
get
from
a
rough
draft
to
the
final
copy,
meant
the
final
was
word
processed,
double
spaced,
and
spell
checked.
The
only
considerate
changes
consisted
of
a
few
comma
insertions.
Once
again,
within
the
formal
steps
of
the
writing
process
most
of
the
work
was
complete,
so
I
felt
it
was
a
sin
to
change
what
I
already
worked
so
hard
to
write.
Now
that
I
look
back,
writing
has
always
been
a
systematic
process
for
me.
When
I
began
to
write
compositions
for
literature
texts
in
high
school,
I
depended
on
the
system
even
moreso.
The
steps
were
drilled
into
me
so
thoroughly
I
can
still
recite
them.
Brainstorm.
Thesis
statement.
Intro
paragraph.
3-5
supporting
body
paragraphs
with
analysis.
Transitions.
Conclusion.
All
these
things
were
the
vital
ingredients
in
a
good
paper.
The
recipe
was
always
the
same.
The
ingredients
just
had
to
be
adjusted
for
each
paper
topic
-for
a
longer
paper
just
add
more
body.
Restrictions
in
writing
included
no
first
person,
no
contractions,
and
no
reciting
of
plot.
Otherwise,
add
all
ingredients,
bake
two
days
before
due,
let
cool,
and
then
frosting
on
the
final
copy.
When
I
came
to
college,
I
felt
confident
that
high
school
had
made
me
a
good
writer.
All
I
had
to
do
was
apply
my
techniques
for
a
successful
paper.
The
formal
process
I
learned
in
high
school
helped
give
my
papers
shape
and
organization.
Now,
the
hardest
part
I
encounter
each
day
is
finding
the
words.
Although
high
school
laid
a
firm
foundation
for
me,
its
tight
method
trained
me
to
be
a
stubborn
perfectionist.
In
my
first
year,
I
could
not
move
on
to
a
supporting
body
paragraph
until
my
introduction
was
complete
and
perfect.
It
was
the
first
step
in
my
writing
process,
and
I
felt
I
could
not
continue
until
I
completed
it.
This
led
to
many
hours
of
writing
and
rewriting
of
one
paragraph.
Nothing
else
flowed
until
the
intro
was
finished.
In
addition,
I
did
not
know
how
to
draft
and
then
rewrite.
Whatever
I
typed
onto
the
screen
had
to
be
exactly
perfect
or
else
I
could
not
move
on.
Now,
my
process
is
a
bit
more
flexible.
I've
learned
to
develop
ideas
as
they
come
out,
not
in
the
order
they
have
to
be
in
the
final
product.
But
the
most
valuable
lesson
I've
learned
is
called
FREEWRITING.
when
i
freewrite
i
ignore
all
rules
and
just
let
my
ideas
flow.
sometimes
i
find
only
one
or
two
ideas
useful
afterward
but
that
is
more
than
i
started
with.
freewriting
is
like
talking
to
yourself
and
recording
it
like
a
tape
recorder.
when
i
freewrite
i
don't
feel
like
i'm
writing
a
paper
so
it
is
like
reverse
psychology
to
release
my
writer's
block.
sometimes
i
even
freewrite
a
whole
paper
and
it
becomes
my
roughest
draft.
so
ask
me
now
what
it
means
to
rewrite
and
i
can
tell
you
it
isn't
all
about
spell-check.
i
could
go
on
for
hours
freewriting
about
things.
but
i'll
stop
now
b/c
you
get
the
idea.
During
my
time
at
Lafayette,
I
have
written
both
analytically
and
scientifically.
In
each
case,
writing
intelligently
about
any
topic
requires
advance
thought
and
preparation.
But
beneath
it
lies
the
same
method
for
me
be
it
scientific
or
literary
writing:
organization,
structure,
and
coherence.
The
systematic
research
technique
of
writing
has
given
me
a
guide.
Freewriting
has
given
me
the
green
light
to
start
writing.
And
rewriting
has
given
me
the
yield
to
change.
My
years
as
a
WA
have
helped
me
to
help
others.
I
don't
think
writing
will
ever
come
easily
to
me,
but
with
this
process
I
know
when
the
ideas
finally
take
shape,
they
will
have
their
instructions
on
where
to
go
and
what
to
do.
