WA
narrative
I
had
a
very
rewarding
year
as
a
writing
associate.
First,
the
WA
workshop
helped
me
learn
more
about
what
I
was
about
to
start
doing,
and
some
stories
shared
by
more
experienced
WA's
gave
me
a
good
picture
of
what
to
expect.
Second,
meeting
with
students
was
usually
a
good
experience
as
well,
because
I
felt
that
I
was
helping
them
in
some
way
and
they
were
very
appreciative.
Besides,
I
had
a
very
special
kind
of
students
in
my
group
-international
students.
It
was
amazing
sometimes
how
much
I
could
learn
from
just
speaking
to
someone
from
a
different
country
and
culture.
When
I
just
received
a
notification
from
the
English
department
that
I
was
accepted
to
work
as
a
writing
associate,
I
was
very
glad
but
also
somewhat
confused.
I
remembered
seeing
my
WA
for
the
first
time
when
I
was
a
freshman
-
I
was
not
sure
what
I
was
supposed
to
do,
how
I
was
supposed
to
react
and
why
exactly
I
needed
to
see
a
WA
in
the
first
place.
I
imagined
that
some
other
students
might
be
feeling
this
way
when
they
meet
with
me.
Moreover,
there
was
another
concern:
I
was
assigned
to
work
with
international
students,
many
of
whom
have
never
worked
with
a
WA
before.
Lafayette
has
a
very
strict
admission
policy
for
foreign
students,
who
have
to
achieve
a
minimum
score
of
600
points
(out
of
a
650-point
maximum)
on
the
TOEFL,
the
international
English
proficiency
test
for
foreigners.
Having
passed
this
test
and
been
accepted
to
Lafayette,
many
international
students
might
feel
that
they
are
proficient
enough
in
English
and
do
not
need
any
help.
However,
my
experience
has
been
that
even
students
who
are
good
writers
usually
need
someone
to
look
over
their
papers.
It
is
even
more
so
with
international
students.
Even
though
they
might
know
they
were
good
writers
in
their
own
language,
there
is
often
a
concern
that
they
may
not
be
able
to
perform
as
well
when
expressing
themselves
in
English.
Most
international
students
that
I
have
worked
with
were
rather
good
writers,
the
main
problem
of
whom
was
a
lack
of
confidence.
I
usually
met
with
such
writers
several
times
and
corrected
some
minor
mistakes
that
they
had
in
the
structure
of
the
paper
or
grammar,
but
as
the
first
semester
was
ending,
they
usually
were
confident
enough
that
they
did
not
require
any
further
assistance.
Some
writers
were
not
as
proficient
and
required
more
attention
and
effort.
I
worked
with
one
student
who
time
after
time
received
grades
that
he
thought
were
too
low
for
his
writing
skills
and
the
effort
he
had
put
in
his
FYS
papers.
He
was
persuaded
that
if
he
were
a
good
writer
in
Spanish
(that
was
what
he
thought,
at
least),
then
it
would
not
be
a
problem
for
him
to
succeed
in
writing
in
English.
It
actually
turned
out
that
he
first
wrote
his
papers
in
Spanish,
and
then
translated
them
into
English!
Both
myself
and
professor
Qualtere
had
to
put
quite
a
bit
of
effort
to
persuade
him
that
he
needed
our
help
and
that
literally
translating
from
another
language
just
did
not
work.
At
the
end
of
the
year,
he
worked
with
another
ESL
WA,
and
I
do
not
know
how
much
he
improved
after
I
last
met
with
him,
but
it
seemed
that
he
was
already
making
progress
in
the
first
semester.
One
of
my
most
rewarding
experiences
as
a
WA
last
year
has
been
working
with
a
student
who
was
a
relatively
good
writer
in
general,
but
she
did
not
know
how
to
write
introductions
and
conclusions.
It
seemed
to
her
that
those
parts
were
unnecessary,
because,
according
to
her,
it
would
be
much
easier
if
a
writer
just
talked
about
business
without
wasting
sentences
in
the
beginning
and
at
the
end
of
the
paper.
As
I
worked
with
her
over
several
months,
I
could
see
a
big
improvement
in
her
writing
in
every
paper
that
I
read.
It
was
great
to
know
that
at
least
some
of
that
improvement
might
have
been
due
to
my
efforts.
In
addition
to
specific
concerns
about
being
an
ESL
WA,
I
had
some
worries
that
all
WA's
probably
had
when
they
were
starting
to
work.
I
was
not
sure
how
I
was
going
to
tell
someone
that
their
paper
either
was
not
what
the
professor
was
expecting,
lacked
structure
or
was
full
of
stylistic
errors.
Writing
is
something
very
personal,
something
that
comes
from
someone's
experiences,
feelings,
and
emotions.
It
seemed
to
me
that
if
I
criticize
someone's
paper,
he
or
she
might
take
it
as
a
personal
offense.
I
also
wanted
to
comment
on
another
part
of
the
job
that
mostly
just
ESL
WA's
complete
-
reaching
out
to
students.
Because
ESL
WA's
are
not
assigned
to
a
specific
class,
students
are
not
required
to
meet
with
them.
If
an
international
student
feels
he
or
she
is
experiencing
problems
with
English,
they
can
call
me
or
connect
with
me
through
professor
Qualtere
and
sign
up
for
an
appointment.
However,
some
students
do
not
know
that
such
service
exists,
or
they
may
think
that
asking
for
help
is
shameful.
I
also
came
from
a
background
where
a
teacher
was
the
absolute
authority
in
school,
and
the
lectures
and
seminars
that
students
attended
were
supposed
to
be
enough
for
their
understanding
of
the
subject.
In
Russia,
teachers
did
not
hold
office
hours
because
it
was
thought
that
if
a
student
comes
after
class,
he
or
she
must
have
not
been
listening
in
class.
Therefore,
most
students
were
afraid
to
ask
for
help
because
they
thought
their
teacher
would
think
that
they
were
stupid
or
lazy.
Professor
Qualtere
and
other
ESL
WA's
knew
about
this
possible
problem,
so
an
outreach
strategy
was
designed.
Each
ESL
WA
received
a
list
of
students
that
he
or
she
was
responsible
for,
and
we
needed
to
communicate
with
the
students,
get
to
know
them
at
least
a
little
bit,
call
them
on
the
phone
on
the
regular
basis
just
to
see
if
they
needed
any
help.
It
was
sometimes
hard
to
make
it
seem
casual,
because
we
did
not
want
the
students
to
think
that
their
English
professors
asked
us
to
call
them.
But
I
found
such
regular
contacts
with
my
students
to
be
very
helpful,
not
only
socially
but
also
in
terms
of
being
able
to
help
them
better
if
I
knew
a
little
bit
about
them,
which
background
they
came
from,
or
what
their
personalities
were
like.
Besides,
I
made
some
very
good
friends
when
I
was
doing
outreach
for
my
WA
job!
Everything
has
its
drawbacks,
and
I
had
some
negative
experiences,
although
there
were
very
few.
One
of
them
was
when
students
did
not
show
up
for
their
conferences,
or
when
they
were
very
late.
After
this
happened
several
times
with
the
same
student,
I
found
that
I
was
reluctant
to
schedule
meetings
with
him
again.
Usually,
however,
students
were
on
time
-
it
is
probably
related
to
me
being
an
ESL
WA,
when
none
of
the
writing
conferences
are
mandatory
and
students
only
come
to
me
if
they
want
help.
Another
negative
experience
that
I
had
was
a
student
who
started
to
argue
with
me
when
I
was
making
corrections,
and
that
was
not
just
arguing,
but
saying
that
he
actually
knows
better.
I
was
wondering
then
why
he
kept
coming
to
me
several
times
if
he
knew
how
to
write
better
than
I
was
suggesting.
I
also
want
to
mention
that
I
had
a
very
positive
experience
working
with
professor
Qualtere
and
other
ESL
WA's.
We
had
weekly
meetings
at
lunch,
and
discussed
our
experiences
with
students
from
the
previous
week.
I
found
it
very
helpful
to
listen
to
what
other
WA's
said,
how
they
dealt
with
difficulties
and
how
they
helped
the
students.
As
for
my
own
writing
style,
I
do
not
think
that
it
has
changed
very
much
since
I
have
become
a
WA.
I
do,
however,
sometimes
look
at
my
writing
from
a
different
perspective,
because
dealing
with
people
from
very
diverse
backgrounds
made
me
realize
that
I
should
not
take
anything
for
granted
when
I
talk
to
my
audience.
No
matter
how
common
or
easy
a
topic
is,
a
very
thorough
and
careful
explanation
is
often
needed
for
a
reader
who
perhaps
is
coming
from
a
different
part
of
the
world,
or
has
a
different
religious
or
other
background.
Finally,
working
as
a
WA
definitely
improved
my
theoretical
knowledge
of
the
English
grammar.
I
had
to
explain
to
the
writer
why
their
sentences
or
words
were
not
correct,
and
in
order
to
do
that
I
had
to
point
them
to
a
specific
rule
or
page
in
St.
Martin's
book.
The
ESL
program
has
even
put
together
some
materials
for
the
international
students
that
were
not
covered
in
that
handbook,
which
we
also
used
in
our
conferences
and
I
feel
that
they
helped
not
only
my
students
but
increased
my
awareness
of
the
different
styles
and
writing
techniques
in
English.
To
conclude,
I
will
say
that
I
have
had
a
great
time
working
as
a
WA
last
year.
I
learned
about
the
process
of
writing
from
a
different
perspective
-
before
that
I
was
just
writing
and
other
people
were
grading
and
criticizing
my
papers,
and
as
a
WA,
I
was
evaluating
the
writing
of
others.
I
also
thought
it
was
a
very
enriching
experience
socially.
I
am
definitely
looking
forward
to
the
new
year
as
a
WA!
