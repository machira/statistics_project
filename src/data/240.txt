Returning
WA
Writing

WA

As
I
mentioned
in
my
narrative
from
last
year,
writing
never
posed
a
real
challenge
to
me.
Occasional
assignments
would
give
me
reason
to
worry,
or
perhaps
spend
lengthy
amounts
of
time
writing,
re-writing
and
editing,
but
overall,
I
enjoyed
writing
and
it
was
a
skill
that
came
fairly
easily
to
me.
Last
semester,
however,
was
certainly
the
most
challenging
year
of
my
life
as
a
writer.
Not
only
did
I
face
the
new
challenge
of
becoming
a
writing
associate,
but
I
spent
the
spring
semester
in
Washington,
DC
at
the
American
University's
Washington
Semester
Program
where
I
studied
journalism.
Students
from
all
parts
of
the
country,
as
well
as
all
over
the
world,
come
to
Washington
for
a
semester
in
order
to
study
the
culture
of
our
nation's
capital,
take
courses
which
pertain
to
the
capital
city
and
complete
an
internship
in
any
kind
of
field.
The
program
offers
about
six
different
areas
of
study
and
a
wide
range
of
internship
opportunities.
While
in
Washington,
I
completed
an
internship
at
the
American
Bar
Association
(ABA)
and
took
classes
in
journalism.
When
I
was
younger,
since
writing
was
something
that
I
enjoyed,
I
always
contemplated
becoming
a
journalist
when
I
grew
up.
Although
I
loved
the
program,
I
have
since
decided
that
journalism
is
not
for
me.
Besides
convincing
me
that
journalism
was
the
wrong
field
for
me,
the
Washington
Semester
Program
brought
on
numerous
challenges
and
rewards
in
the
area
of
writing.
Last
year
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
I
can
remember
really
struggling
before
assignments
were
due.
I
couldn't
wait
until
the
last
minute
any
longer.
I
worked
on
assignments
weeks
in
advance
so
that
I
could
have
time
to
truly
edit
my
articles.
I
never
worked
for
a
school
newspaper
before,
so
I
had
zero
experience
writing
for
print
and
even
less
experience
in
writing
for
television.
When
I
received
the
first
assignment
from
my
professor,
I
thought
the
course
was
going
to
be
cake.
We
had
a
paper
due
each
week,
but
they
usually
had
to
be
around
500
words
or
less.
I
couldn't
believe
it.
Less
than
a
page!
How
much
easier
could
it
get
than
to
have
seven
days
to
write
one
page.
But,
I
found
out
very
quickly
that
short
writing
assignments
did
not
equal
easy
writing
assignments.
On
the
day
he
passed
back
our
first
assignment
I
immediately
realized
this
wasn't
going
to
be
easy
for
me.
I
got
a
C!
I
never
got
a
C
on
a
written
assignment
in
my
life.
Of
course,
I
talked
with
the
professor
and
realized
my
two
main
problems:
1)
grammar
and
2)
wordiness.
I
had
never
thought
of
grammar
as
a
problem
for
me.
And
I
guess
it
was
more
of
a
weakness
than
a
real
problem.
In
most
of
my
writing
courses
both
here
at
Lafayette
and
when
I
was
in
high
school,
content
completely
outweighed
grammar.
Although
teachers
and
professors
would
stress
that
grammar
was
important,
unless
a
paper
had
major
grammatical
flaws
that
made
it
difficult
to
read,
the
content
was
what
the
grade
was
based
on.
And
because
I
had
no
major
grammatical
difficulties,
I
assumed
I
had
none.
My
journalism
professor
quickly
showed
me
otherwise.
In
the
field
of
journalism,
correct
grammar
is
absolutely
essential.
Although
there
are
always
editors,
a
journalist
should
not
expect
that
all
of
his
or
her
grammatical
mistakes
will
be
corrected
by
someone
else.
Editors
have
numerous
tasks
to
perform
on
their
own,
in
addition
to
editing
their
staff's
articles.
And
if
a
journalist's
article
goes
to
print
with
grammatical
errors,
it
is
not
only
the
editor's
fault,
but
his
or
her
own
as
well.
And
both
the
editor
and
the
writer
will
pay
for
their
mistakes.
My
second
main
problem
was
being
able
to
fit
all
the
important
facts
and
details
that
a
reader
would
need
to
know
into
a
short
article.
500
words
doesn't
give
you
much
room
for
BS
.
And
some
of
the
assignments
for
the
course
gave
us
even
less
words
to
work
with.
For
example,
when
we
learned
how
to
write
for
television
news
broadcasts,
we
learned
each
segment
is
about
30
seconds.
A
30
second
voice
over
is
about
one
paragraph
or
5
sentences
long.
Therefore,
in
one
paragraph
I
would
have
to
highlight
the
major
events
of
a
story
I
spent
all
day
covering.
Journalists
must
be
concise
and
precise
in
their
writing
and
since
I
was
used
to
writing
papers
that
were
a
minimum
of
six
pages
long,
condensing
my
writing
was
very
difficult
for
me.
Many
of
my
first
articles
really
said
nothing,
but
were
filled
with
a
lot
of
unnecessary
words
and
phrases.
I
think
I
truly
benefited
from
my
journalism
course
in
Washington.
I
think
my
writing
is
much
more
accurate,
much
more
grammatically
correct,
and
certainly
more
concise
and
to
the
point.
I
also
noticed
that
because
I
really
was
struggling
at
first
to
make
my
articles
well-written
and
detailed,
I
became
a
better
writer
overall
because
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
going
back
to
edit
and
re-write
papers,
something
I
never
really
did
before.
I
realized
that
this
challenge
brought
on
the
greatest
improvement
in
my
writing
that
I
have
ever
seen.
And
I
know
that
although
I
was
away
from
the
Writing
Associate
Program
for
a
semester,
I
will
be
re-entering
it
more
prepared
than
ever.
I
will
be
able
to
share
my
experience
with
the
students
I
work
with,
so
that
they
too
will
benefit
from
my
challenge.
One
of
the
most
difficult
aspects
of
being
a
WA
was
that
I
often
couldn't
relate
to
the
problems
and
difficulties
that
the
student
had
with
writing.
However,
now
that
I
too
have
overcome
an
obstacle
in
the
writing
process,
I
think
I
am
more
prepared
to
help
students
overcome
their
obstacles
and
challenges.
I
also
think
that
the
tremendous
amount
of
editing
I
did
last
semester
will
help
me
to
be
more
thorough
when
reading
their
papers.
And
since
I
felt
I
benefited
so
much
from
being
a
writing
associate
before,
I
can
only
imagine
that
these
rewards
will
increase
even
more
so
this
year
having
completed
my
Washington
Semester
Program.
Acting
as
a
writing
associate
was
another
great
challenge
in
my
path
to
becoming
a
great
writer,
but
in
a
very
different
way.
I
certainly
noticed
an
improvement
in
my
writing
having
joined
the
WA
program
last
year.
I
realized
that
not
only
was
I
going
to
be
helping
the
students,
but
the
students
were
going
to
be
helping
me,
in
many
ways.
For
example,
I
had
a
very
busy
schedule
fall
semester
with
classes,
tutoring,
student
government
and
joining
on
as
a
WA.
I
wasn't
sure
at
first
if
I
was
going
to
be
able
to
handle
it
all,
but
having
so
many
activities
and
responsibilities
to
juggle
at
once
forced
me
to
really
budget
my
time.
There
were
times
when
I
had
15
student
appointments,
which
meant
fifteen
student
papers
to
read,
while
also
completing
multiple
written
assignments
and
exams
of
my
own.
One
of
the
greatest
challenges
I
met
as
a
WA
was
how
to
make
my
conferences
most
successful.
Some
students
needed
very
little
help
and
others
it
seemed
would
take
hours
for
me
to
really
help
show
them
what
their
papers
needed,
and
teach
them
a
way
to
improve
it
on
their
own.
I
decided
that
each
student
should
have
a
writing
goal
in
mind
and
I
was
going
to
help
each
of
them
focus
on
improving
that
one
goal.
Although
I
couldn't
always
limit
my
conferences
to
one
subject,
I
did
find
that
stressing
one
particular
difficulty
over
and
over
throughout
the
course
of
the
semester
really
helped
each
student's
writing
style
improve.
It
also
helped
me
to
prepare
for
my
conferences
ahead
of
time,
and
to
have
an
idea
of
what
I
wanted
to
discuss
in
my
meetings.
In
addition,
I
found
that
I
benefited
as
a
writer
because
I
too
came
up
with
a
writing
goal
for
myself
in
each
one
of
my
classes.
Since
I
concentrated
on
a
few
aspects
of
my
writing
over
the
semester,
I
noticed
a
significant
improvement
by
the
time
December
rolled
around.
Each
year
WA's
complain
because
we
feel
that
a
large
portion
of
our
time
gets
wasted
because
students
come
to
meetings
unprepared,
or
often
times
don't
show
up
at
all.
Some
of
them
even
have
the
nerve
to
reschedule
appointments,
and
miss
the
new
date
and
time
as
well.
This
caused
me
great
frustration
last
year,
but
what
gave
me
an
even
greater
challenge
was
a
particular
student
who
wanted
to
meet
with
me
all
the
time.
The
FYS
course
that
I
worked
with
during
the
fall
had
four
writing
assignments
so
I
was
required
to
meet
with
each
student
four
times.
One
girl
in
the
course
was
having
great
difficulty
with
the
assignments
and
usually
wanted
to
meet
with
me
twice
as
much
because
she
was
so
nervous
about
her
grade
in
the
course.
She
also
would
ask
me
to
meet
her
last
minute
at
times
so
that
I
could
read
her
final
copy
before
she
handed
in
the
assignment.
I
was
thrilled
with
her
enthusiasm
about
the
program
at
first,
but
I
quickly
realized
I
couldn't
meet
all
of
her
writing
needs,
and
my
own
as
well.
It
was
difficult
for
me
to
say
no,
but
at
times,
I
had
no
other
choice.
Of
course
I
suggested
the
drop-in
program,
but
being
that
she
was
shy
and
felt
comfortable
with
me,
to
my
knowledge,
she
never
used
the
drop-in
hours.
It
is
difficult
to
say
no
to
someone
that
wants
your
help,
but
when
it
was
becoming
a
problem
for
me
I
had
no
other
choice.
I
would
certainly
advise
new
WA's
not
to
feel
pressured
by
a
student
to
meet
with
him
or
her
much
above
and
beyond
the
required
amounts,
because
your
grades
and
work
should
not
be
put
in
jeopardy
for
the
benefit
of
another
student.
One
of
the
greatest
rewards
of
the
program
was
working
with
the
other
student
writing
associates.
I
found
myself
asking
a
lot
of
questions
and
taking
advice
from
returning
WA's
and
I
hope
that
the
new
WA's
will
do
the
same.
It
is
a
truly
amazing
and
rewarding
experience.
In
one
sense
you
feel
empowered
by
the
challenge
and
other
times
you
will
find
yourself
unsure
and
full
of
questions.
But
I
have
no
doubt
that
all
of
the
new
WA's
will
find
the
program
as
beneficial
to
their
path
to
becoming
a
great
writer
as
I
found
it
to
be
for
me.
I
feel
that
my
experience
as
both
a
WA
and
a
journalism
student
have
helped
me
grow
as
a
person
and
a
writer
and
I
plan
to
use
all
of
these
skills
in
order
to
succeed
this
upcoming
year,
and
in
years
to
come.
