The
Personal
Statement
of
a
Returning
WA
8/22/99
Generally,
one
does
not
equate
a
scientist's
schooling
or
profession
with
a
love
of
English,
or
a
love
of
writing.
Biologists
are
taught
to
see
the
world
around
them,
but
to
think
clearly
and
logically
about
this
world;
creativity
is
optional
and
seldom
encouraged.
Assigned
papers
are
laboratory
reports
or
research
papers
on
obscure
subjects
with
scientific
names
that
would
terrify
a
novice.
Writing
for
science
courses,
therefore,
is
usually
dry
and
straightforward-
its
difficulty
lies
in
condensing
a
plethora
of
information
into
a
paragraph
of
maximum
clarity
and
minimum
length,
as
required
by
scientific
journals.
This
is
a
challenge
in
itself,
and
a
college
student
learns
quickly
that
any
growth
as
a
writer
will
come
from
refining
these
techniques
of
summary.
This
is
what
I
have
found
to
be
my
biggest
change
as
a
writer
in
the
past
year.
As
a
high
school
student,
I
loved
running
home
with
a
writing
assignment
that
would
draw
on
my
already
overactive
imagination
and
require
the
utmost
creativity.
I
would
spend
hours
thinking
and
scribbling,
writing
about
nature
and
people,
and
all
that
I
thought
about
life.
Writing
was
my
escape
and
my
joy;
it
was
a
way
of
dealing
with
troubled
times,
and
confusion,
as
well
as
a
way
to
express
myself
in
the
shy
and
unsure
years
of
adolescence.
Back
then,
improvements
and
strengths
in
my
writing
were
much
different.
Anthropomorphism
was
abundant,
and
I
expended
most
of
my
effort
to
make
my
thoughts
and
words
come
to
life
through
similes
and
adjectives,
that
unraveled
into
long
flowery
sentences.
I
was
a
silent
observer,
who
had
a
need
to
see
the
world
and
objects
beyond
their
mere
surface,
and
who
had
an
insatiable
need
to
put
my
thoughts,
theories,
and
observations
into
the
perfect
words.
Though
many
professors
are
reluctant
to
encourage
this
kind
of
"wordy"
writing,
my
FYS
was
taught
by
one
that
recognized
the
importance
of
expression
and
thought
and
who
condoned
adjectives
and
sentences
that
some
may
find
"wordy".
My
transition
to
college
writing,
therefore,
was
smooth
and
easy.
It
was
also
enjoyable
as
the
subject
matter
of
my
FYS
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
reflect,
and
write
papers
that
incorporated
my
thoughts
and
feelings.
There
was
an
increase
in
maturity
as
I
grew
and
crossed
the
bridge
into
college
life,
and
much
of
my
growth
as
a
writer
in
my
freshman
year
was
a
result
of
all
of
the
new
experiences
that
I
had
to
draw
upon.
Beginning
with
my
second
semester
though,
my
FYS
was
a
class
gone
by,
and
the
transition
to
scientist
began.
Since
then,
and
over
the
past
year,
changes
in
my
writing
have
gone
unnoticed
to
me,
perhaps
because
of
the
lack
of
assigned
papers
and
consequent
lack
of
practice
and
improvement.
Major
requirements
and
the
regimented
schedule
of
a
biology
major
are
demanding,
and
the
opportunities
to
take
courses
outside
of
my
discipline
have
waned.
It
is
unfortunate;
I
miss
writing
papers.
The
only
times
that
my
fingers
strike
a
keyboard
now,
are
when
I
am
typing
a
laboratory
report,
or
a
rare
research
paper.
Creativity
is
an
emotion
of
the
past.
I
still
write
on
my
own,
for
enjoyment
or
comfort,
but
time
is
scarce,
and
I
often
feel
that
my
thought
and
writing
process
are
rusty.
My
decision
to
become
a
WA
as
a
sophomore
was
a
direct
result
of
the
longing
to
get
these
processes
back.
I
wanted
to
remember
why
writing
used
to
seem
easy.
Then
I
could
pass
my
knowledge
to
other
writers
in
hopes
that
they
would
continue
to
write,
staying
in
practice
and
avoiding
the
same
deterioration
that
I
was
experiencing.
I
very
badly
wanted
to
pass
along
my
forgotten
love
of
writing
to
others,
and
to
improve
their
thought
process,
and
style,
hopefully
making
their
transition
to
college
writing
as
easy
as
my
own
had
been.
I
met
my
WA
commencement
with
enthusiasm
and
excitement.
What
I
lacked
in
experience
would
be
abated
by
my
passion
for
the
job.
Each
writer
that
I
met
with
would
improve,
and
by
the
end
of
the
semester
would
be
an
eloquent,
confident,
and
eager
writer.
A
year
later,
I
still
haven't
lost
this
passion
for
the
job,
but
my
over
enthusiasm
has
been
lessened
by
reality.
Last
year,
I
quickly
realized
that
my
expectations
of
perfection
were
not
only
impossible,
but
also
unfair.
My
first
meeting
with
my
assigned
class
made
me
realize
that
there
is
a
distinct
but
unrecognized
knack
to
teaching,
and
to
becoming
good
at
peer
communication.
As
later
discussed
in
staff
meetings,
the
WA
assumes
an
automatic
authority,
the
writer,
a
submissiveness,
that
among
peers
can
cause
resentment
or
unresponsiveness
if
not
handled
delicately.
I
discovered
this
on
my
own
however,
before
conferences
had
even
begun.
On
a
sunny,
cool,
Thursday
morning,
during
the
first
week
of
classes,
I
got
up
well
before
my
first
class
to
go
meet
my
assigned
FYS.
A
quiet
person,
I
don't
mind,
but
don't
particularly
like
to
speak
in
front
of
people
and
usually
only
talk
in
class
if
called
on.
So,
I
had
rehearsed
a
little
speech,
to
quell
my
nervousness,
and
written
down
a
few
pertinent
points
on
a
note
card
so
that
I
didn't
forget
to
say
anything
important.
The
professor
introduced
me,
and
I
began
my
monologue,
stating
my
expectations
(don't
miss
meetings,
call
if
you'll
be
late,
I'm
busy
too,
etc...)
and
hopes
for
the
semester.
Looking
out
at
that
sea
of
freshman
faces,
though,
I
realized
that
I
was
doing
a
pretty
poor
job.
There
was
not
a
smile
in
the
room,
just
a
gamut
of
emotions
reflected
on
faces,
ranging
from
indifferent
to
bored
to
nearly
cold.
I
could
almost
hear
the
general
thought
in
each
of
their
minds,
"whatever".
I
gave
my
phone
and
mailbox
number,
and
slipped
out
of
the
room,
anxious
for
some
fresh
air,
and
wondering
why
the
reception
had
been
so
mediocre.
Then
I
realized
that
I
didn't
even
recognize
my
own
voice
while
I
had
been
speaking.
I
was
devoid
of
any
emotion,
unintentionally
sounding
authoritarian,
and
unfriendly.
My
demeanor
was
businesslike,
and
unsmiling.
Had
I
been
a
freshman
in
that
class,
I
would
have
found
the
person
in
front
of
the
classroom
as
approachable
as
a
growling
Doberman.
That
wasn't
at
all
the
type
of
WA
that
I
wanted
to
be.
Luckily,
first
impressions
aren't
always
unbreakable,
and
the
students
didn't
seem
to
remember
or
hold
my
poor
public
speaking
performance
against
me.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I
found
the
one
on
one
conferences
to
be
an
overall
rewarding
and
enjoyable
experience.
Each
of
the
students
had
a
history
as
both
a
person
and
a
writer,
and
getting
them
to
talk
about
themselves
and
their
transition
to
college
both
as
a
person
and
a
student
made
my
job
as
a
peer
reviewer
much
easier
and
more
insightful.
So,
as
early
as
my
first
few
weeks,
I
had
already
learned
a
valuable
lesson
that
I
will
take
with
me
as,
a
speaker,
and
a
person-
people
need
to
be
eased
into
any
new
situation,
and
it's
as
easy
as
a
simple
hello,
some
kind
words,
and
a
smile.
As
a
writer,
I
have
also
begun
to
apply
this
theory
in
my
introduction
even
in
those
dry
lab
reports
as
a
sentence
that
makes
any
reader
feel
like
an
included
audience.
It
works
as
well
in
writing
as
it
does
in
speaking.
Being
a
WA
made
me
grow
as
a
writer
in
other
ways
also.
I
had
never
imagined
how
many
different
levels
that
writers
enter
college
at.
Their
traits
can
be
grouped
and
categorized
to
an
extent,
but
each
writer
is
a
different
combination
of
technical
strengths
and
weaknesses.
Further
adding
to
their
uniqueness
is
their
personality,
receptiveness
to
peer
review,
and
personal
writing
style.
I
met
with
students
who
caused
me
to
stay
up
late
searching
for
something
to
talk
about
because
their
papers
were
devoid
of
fatal
errors
and
already
seemed
perfected.
There
were
students
that
wrote
with
disregard
for
grammar
and
punctuation;
I
actually
received
a
seven
page
paper
written
in
two
paragraphs.
Then
there
were
those
students
whose
ideas
were
wonderful,
but
undeveloped,
and
encrypted
in
a
barrage
of
unlinked
and
free-flowing
sentences.
Introductions
and
conclusions
seemed
common
problem
areas,
and
many
students'
papers
had
become
article
summaries
that
delivered
copied
facts
without
any
input
or
interpretation
from
the
writer.
I
was
actually
terrified
that
three-quarters
of
the
class
would
receive
failing
grades
on
the
first
assignment
due
to
blatant
plagiarism.
Sometimes
though
easy
to
recognize,
these
problem
areas
weren't
easy
to
fix.
Aiding
the
writer
took
the
right
technique
for
each
individual
learner
and
the
proper
interpersonal
skills.
Luckily,
none
of
my
writers
were
hostile,
but
there
were
definitely
different
levels
of
enthusiasm
for
constructive
criticism.
Some
sat
and
eagerly
listened
to
my
words,
receptive
to
advice,
and
being
an
active
participant
in
the
conversation.
These
were
the
easiest
students.
Others,
listened
but
were
quiet.
These
I
quickly
learned
could
be
drawn
into
a
discussion
with
a
cleverly
placed
question
or
two
pertaining
to
their
writing.
Then,
there
were
students
that
I
felt
like
I
was
inconveniencing
with
my
words.
They
could
be
recognized
by
a
tapping
foot
and
a
glazed
expression
as
they
looked
through
me
rather
than
at
me,
and
tried
to
hurry
me
along
with
"yup"s
and
"you're
right"s.
Strangely
enough,
it
was
these
papers
that
often
needed
the
most
work,
and
I
found
myself
talking
as
fast
as
possible,
trying
desperately
to
make
them
realize
where
they
could
improve
if
only
they
would
bother
to
listen.
These
conferences
still
frustrate
me,
and
I
have
yet
to
find
a
method
to
make
a
student
who
doesn't
care
learn.
Trying
to
cater
to
each
individual
made
the
help
process
unique.
However,
often
I
found
that
outlining
ideas,
finding
main
themes,
and
building
on
them
helped
greatly
to
focus
the
individual's
thinking
and
to
organize
the
paper.
Many
writers,
when
asked
to
summarize
their
paper's
meaning
are
at
a
loss,
and
consequently,
helping
them
find
their
central
theme
brings
the
paper
together.
Simply
taking
a
few
minutes
to
teach
a
writer
the
importance
of
critically
reading
their
paper
as
an
outsider
would,
playing
both
advocate
and
critic,
alleviates
both
grammar
problems
and
problems
of
unsupported
or
misplaced
arguments.
I've
learned
that
getting
a
writer
to
talk
is
the
key
to
a
successful
conference,
and
that
a
WA
should
never
offer
alternate
wording-
this
lesson
came
only
after
I
caught
a
couple
of
writers
copying
my
words
onto
their
paper
verbatim,
almost
an
entire
paragraph
written,
after
a
couple
of
cleverly
placed
"how
should
I
change
this
sentence"s.
My
experiences
as
a
WA
have
definitely
been
formative
and
valuable.
I
still
remember
the
feeling
when
the
second
set
of
drafts
came
in
for
my
research
papers,
and
the
improvement
was
blinding.
Watching
the
FYS
students
grow
as
writers
from
the
beginning
of
the
semester
to
the
end
was
particularly
rewarding,
and
I
saw
their
newfound
maturity
begin
to
change
their
writing
voices.
It
was
the
same
transition
that
I
had
recognized
in
my
own
voice
during
my
first
semester
at
Lafayette.
I
like
to
think
that
as
a
WA
I
played
at
least
a
small
part
in
the
improvements
of
some
of
the
writers,
even
if
it
was
just
teaching
them
to
think
about
a
subject
a
little
harder
on
their
own.
The
experience
also
meant
a
lot
to
me
as
a
writer.
Though
many
of
these
assignments
were
probably
as
mundane
and
straightforward
to
the
writer
as
my
laboratory
reports
were
to
me,
to
the
removed
reader,
they
were
pretty
interesting.
I
learned
all
about
genetic
engineering,
and
the
dangers
of
using
unsustainable
resources,
and
I
found
a
lot
of
passion
in
these
words.
Both
of
these
courses
were
related
to
science
or
engineering,
and
these
writers
were
still
given
the
chance
to
express
themselves.
Perhaps
I
had
just
hit
a
bad
semester
of
courses
creatively
speaking.
With
renewed
passion
for
writing,
I
attacked
my
VAST
course,
and
found
a
way
to
incorporate
the
same
type
of
emotion
as
these
writers
into
the
pages
of
necessary
but
boring
research.
In
addition,
as
I
was
struggling
with
one
of
my
research
papers
because
of
an
overabundance
of
information,
I
found
myself
scribbling
a
short
outline
to
focus
my
thinking
on
a
central
idea
and
the
relevant
supporting
arguments.
As
a
beginning
WA
I
had
trouble
teaching
writers
to
improve
their
problem
areas
because
as
a
writer
myself
I
never
had
a
problem
focusing.
I
just
wrote
my
papers
in
one
sitting
scribbling
furiously
for
hours,
with
the
ideas
simply
falling
into
place
in
a
logical
order
in
my
head.
As
a
WA
I
was
a
hypocrite-1
never
outlined,
never
stated
a
clear
thesis,
never
did
much
of
what
I
found
myself
preaching
to
other
writers.
This
had
always
worked
fine
for
me.
But,
when
my
raw
method
of
writing
started
to
fail
me
I
suddenly
took
my
own
advice
and
found
it
to
work
quite
well.
My
conferences
with
my
own
WA
were
also
different.
I
found
myself
thinking
more
like
a
WA,
trying
to
act
as
that
ideal
student,
rather
than
the
quiet,
listener
that
I
had
been
the
year
before.
My
questions
of
her
were
more
focused
as
I
saw
the
errors
in
my
own
writing
as
I
identified
them
in
other's
writing.
I
also
accepted
my
resentment
for
her
constructive
criticism.
Writing
is
very
personal,
and
criticism
often
seems
like
an
attack
on
feelings
and
thoughts
rather
than
on
words.
Coming
from
a
peer,
it
becomes
extremely
easy
to
dismiss
because
the
WA
is
"no
better"
than
yourself.
But,
I
made
sure
to
listen
carefully,
ignore
these
feelings
of
annoyance,
and
change
my
problem
areas
as
she
had
pointed
out.
Being
a
WA
and
a
writer
was
a
balance
that
was
invaluable-
each
gave
me
the
understanding
and
the
insight
necessary
to
become
better
at
the
other.
These
experiences
have
shaped
and
formed
me
as
a
writer,
a
speaker,
and
a
person.
Each
conference
has
taught
me
a
new
lesson,
though
not
always
about
writing,
and
it
is
with
great
enthusiasm
that
I
enter
my
second
year
as
a
WA.
It
is
a
relief
to
not
be
a
newcomer,
and
to
know
what
to
expect.
But,
I
am
sure
that
each
conference
will
continue
to
challenge
me
and
teach
me
so
that
I
will
continue
to
become
a
better
WA
and
a
better
writer.
