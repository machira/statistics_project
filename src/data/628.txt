Literary
Narrative
Returning
WA
August
2009
The
most
formative
realization
of
WAing
this
last
year
was
one
that
began
a
few
semesters
prior.
It
began
as
an
understanding
that
I
didnOt
enjoy
writing-I
only
enjoyed
having
written.
Thankfully,
this
narrative
can
serve
as
an
addendum
to
last
yearsO
thoughts,
as
I
now
have
begun
to
enjoy
to
struggles
of
writing,
despite
its
furtive
and
often
frustrating
nature.
Enrolling
in
four
writing
courses
in
prior
semesters
might
not
have
been
the
best
idea,
as
an
anal
Nthis
needs
to
be
perfect
because
I
donOt
want
to
write
a
second
draftO
kind
of
writer.
However,
it
was
completing
that
staggering
semester
that
brought
me
over
the
hump.
NRevise,
Revise,
ReviseO
no
longer
sounded
like
a
scary
epithet;
I
see
it
instead
as
comforting
in
a
way,
allowing
me
to
write
whatever
I
want
with
the
knowledge
that
(thankfully)
I
will
inevitably
be
changing
some/most/all
of
it:
I
allow
myself
to
take
more
risks
without
worry
about
immediate
perfection.
I
try
new
devices
and
create
structurally
sound
(though
far
more
interesting)
pieces
of
work.
Other
moments
were
much
more
typical
than
formative.
These
ranged
from
working
with
the
students
who
Njust
really
didnOt
want
to
be
here
right
nowO
to
students
who
literally
thought
God
Himself
would
have
posted
their
work
on
His
fridge
it
was
so
perfect.
The
NtypicalO
challenges
this
last
year
were
in
trying
to
convince
a
particular
set
of
students
that
they
had
ideas
worth
writing
about.
So
often
these
students
were
able
to
articulate
ideas
to
me
in
a
conversation
about
their
work
but
for
some
reason,
these
ideas
didnOt
translate
to
the
page.
I
encouraged
them
to
start
conversations
with
friends
or
roommates
about
their
writing
assignment
thoughts,
and
to
really
listen
to
themselves.
Speaking,
like
writing,
is
another
form
of
communication,
after
all.
Some
students
are
far
more
comfortable
with
the
former
than
the
later.
Convincing
my
students
to
talk
out
their
ideas
was
a
challenge,
but
a
simultaneous
reward
once
they
were
convinced
they
DID
have
ideas
to
contribute
to
a
paper
As
WAs,
we
face
many
challenges.
A
few
of
those,
and
some
of
their
following
rewards,
I
would
like
to
now
touch
on.
Correcting
grammar
and
punctuation
is
often
what
students
want,
but
it
is
rarely
what
they
need.
It
would
be
extremely
easy
for
me
to
read
a
paper,
fix
some
small
errors,
and
send
the
student
on
his
or
her
way.
They
leave
feeling
good
about
their
paper,
and
I
would
feel
good
about
making
students
feel
good.
But
that
is
not
a
WAOs
job.
What
is
more
effective
is
to
work
with
students
on
the
harder,
more
hidden
issues
in
their
paper.
Some
of
the
most
difficult
situations
I
have
encountered
occurred
when
students
were
convinced
their
paper
was
perfect
and
they
were
unwilling
to
work
and
discuss
other
options.
One
student
in
particular
consistently
defended
her
poor
syntax
and
awkward
sentence
structure.
When
I
offered
some
additional
ways
to
word
it,
or
when
I
asked
if
she
had
additional
ways
to
word
it,
she
would
become
defensive
and
would
maintain
that
NAny
other
way
of
putting
it
would
not
get
the
same
meaning
across.O
It
took
two
papers
and
many
comments
from
the
professor
scrawling
NawkO
on
her
work
before
she
became
open
to
my
suggestions.
A
simultaneously
challenge
and
reward
was
getting
passed
the
little
things
while
conferencing.
I
had
trained
myself
to
understand
that
just
because
a
student
had
chosen
to
word,
paraphrase,
or
organized
something
in
a
way
unfamiliar
to
me,
or
more
simply,
in
a
way
I
would
not
have
chosen
to,
did
not
make
the
studentOs
writing
poor
or
wrong.
Different
rarely
means
bad.
Initially,
should
one
of
these
occasions
occur,
I
would
have
suggested
a
different
way
of
writing
something.
It
took
me
a
few
weeks
to
realize
that
I
was
not
offering
up
a
different
way
of
putting
something,
but
instead,
I
was
suggesting
my
way
of
writing.
I
realized
I
had
no
real
reasons
for
wanting
to
change
the
studentOs
writing
other
than
the
fact
that
I
thought
it
just
sounded
better.
Re-writing
something
so
that
it
sounds
better
is
not
being
an
effective
or
helpful
WA.
Instead,
I
learned
to
look
for
other
things
such
as
sentence
structure.
IOd
work
with
the
student
and
talk
about
how
to
most
effectively
convey
ideas.
This
was
the
reward.
I
wrote
about
it
last
year,
but
it
definitely
has
held
and
even
grown.
Sometimes
these
changes
took
the
form
as
it
appeared
in
the
original
draft.
Other
times
it
was
the
way
I
might
have
done
it,
but
most
frequently
it
was
a
way
neither
of
us
had
anticipated.
Other
times,
rewards
came
with
no
proceeding
challenges.
I
began
conducting
a
self-assessment
at
the
end
of
each
conference,
asking
my
student
candidly
if
they
thought
the
WA
conference
was
helpful,
and
if
I
could
do
anything
differently
next
time
to
be
more
of
a
help.
I
valued
my
students
positive
feedback,
and
valued
even
more
their
opinion
of
how
to
improve
as
a
WA.
A
rewarding
experience
came
when
I
received
emails
from
my
students,
thanking
me
for
my
work,
sharing
their
successes
with
me,
and
speaking
kindly
about
me
to
their
professors.
Many
times
as
WAs
we
see
what
we
do
as
a
job,
an
activity,
or
as
a
hobby.
Only
this
last
year
did
I
see
what
I
did
as
a
genuine
service.
That
feeling
was
extremely
rewarding.
Overall,
I
can
classify
these
rewards
into
two
categories.
First
are
the
social
and
personal
rewards
that
manifested
themselves
in
the
development
of
making
new
friends,
learning
about
the
passions
of
students
outside
of
my
major,
and
even
getting
an
inside
look
at
topics
that
were
covered
in
other
classes.
(This
particular
reward,
in
fact,
informed
some
of
my
course
selection
choices
for
subsequent
semester)
The
other
rewards
were
far
more
academic
in
nature.
Serving
as
a
WA
helped
me
become
a
better
writer.
I
was
able
to
take
a
lot
from
our
weekly
staff
meetings
and
thoroughly
valued
the
support
of
my
fellow
WAs.
In
turn,
I
additionally
obtained
much
higher
expectations
of
myself
as
a
writer.
Writing
became
technical.
Something
I
could
grasp,
fix,
and
become
better
at.
There
was
nearly
a
procedure
to
writing,
and
I
found
comfort
in
these
mechanical
and
methodological
processes.
I
began
to
oddly
love
introductory
paragraphs
and
how
they
served
as
a
road
map
and
guide
to
my
papers.
I
enjoyed
creating
outlines
that
helped
me
draw
parallel
themes
and
structures.
I
started
to
appreciate
writing
more
than
I
had
before.
It
still
wasnOt
something
I
regarded
as
NfunO
or
entertaining
but
it
was
no
longer
something
I
had
an
aversion
toward.
In
a
previous
narrative
I
noted
that
one
situation
where
I
could
improve
would
be
in
some
of
my
verbal
interactions
with
student
writers.
I
have
met
with
students
who,
for
some
reason,
are
just
very
quiet.
They
are
not
defensive
of
their
work
or
stubborn
about
change,
but
getting
them
to
talk
is
like
pulling
teeth.
As
someone
who
shies
away
from
awkward
silence
or
feeling
a
need
to
reaffirm
myself
as
a
knowledgeable
writer,
I
felt
that
I
filled
quiet
moments
in
the
conference
by
continuing
to
talk
if
my
students
didnOt
immediate
answer
one
of
my
posed
questions.
I
realized
quickly
that
this
was
not
an
effective
method.
My
narrative
this
year,
therefore,
reflects
the
positive
change
that
I
had
made.
I
started
to
hold
out
the
silences
longer,
and
instead
of
looking
at
the
paper,
I
looked
at
the
student.
This
showed
them
that
I
was
expecting
an
answer
to
come
from
them,
not
to
appear
from
the
paper.
And
when
I
didnOt
talk
for
long
enough,
typically,
they
would
start
to
brainstorm
more
ideas.
Allowing
the
student
to
run
their
own
conference
is
perhaps
the
ideal
situation.
These
obstacles
were
beneficial
to
me
as
a
WA,
for
they
led
to
new
conferencing
methodologies
that
I
could
apply
to
not
only
conferences,
but
to
facilitating
dialogue
with
people
in
many
different
types
of
situations.
After
my
first
few
conferences,
I
incorporated
my
new
methods
and
began
to
have
more
effective
WA
meetings.
I
came
across
many
surprises
in
working
as
a
Writing
Associate
over
this
last
year,
albeit
I
spent
a
semester
abroad.
Particularly
in
reading
the
posed
questions
in
this
yearOs
narrative
prompt,
I
said
Nyes!O
to
many
of
the
posed
questions,
even
in
light
of
my
different
affirmative
responses
last
year.
Breaking
rules,
mirroring
behaviors
and
most
definitely
turning
to
other
WAOs
for
advice
and
support
are
all
techniques,
so
to
speak,
that
I
employed.
Spending
time
in
the
writing
room
during
other
WA
conferences
was
extremely
helpful,
as
I
was
able
to
listen
and
piece
together
some
of
my
favorite
practices
from
other
WAs
that
I
respected.
Unlike
my
sophomore
year
as
a
WA,
my
junior
year
had
me
feeling
more
like
part
of
a
writing
community
with
other
WAs,
and
peer
students
as
well.
With
whatever
little
mini
power-trip
I
was
on
during
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
long
gone,
I
felt
like
I
had
settled
into
an
egalitarian
community
of
writers,
whose
only
go
was
to
create
better
writers,
be
them
students
or
other
associates.
The
authority
I
drew
upon,
then,
was
subtle.
As
I
do
consider
my
students
as
peers,
not
NkidsO
I
come
from
a
background
of
simply
Nhaving
been
there
a
few
timesO
with
whatever
challenge
they
are
facing.
I
think
it
is
reassuring
for
them
to
see
me
feel
comfortable
with
their
work,
no
matter
the
stage,
and
have
the
attitude
that
even
the
most
meager
rough
draft
can
have
awesome
potential.
Beginning
last
year,
I
now
have
a
new
appreciation
for
writing
as
yes,
creative,
but
also
as
a
struggle.
This
has
helped
me
most
during
conferences.
I
think
of
writing
not
as
innovatively
as
before,
but
perhaps,
Nartistically
formulative.O
I
used
this
self-designed
phrase
to
mean
that
good
writing
is
extremely
structural
in
nature.
Yet
it
also
takes
a
mindful
writer
to
artistically
maneuver
his
or
her
way
throughout
the
paper
to
hide
the
structure,
while
the
reader
still
benefits
from
its
presence.
I
wager
that
the
average
college
student
could
pick
out
the
standard-taught
Nfive
paragraph
essayO
in
around
three
seconds.
Yet
even
some
of
the
richest
texts
and
acclaimed
works
benefit
from
similar
structures.
The
authors
of
such
writing
vary
from
the
middle
school
students
mastering
this
form
to
good
writers
with
the
ability
to
incorporate,
weave
and
create
language.
They
work
with
transitions,
shifts,
etc
that
will
mask
such
a
seemingly
arid
work.
This
has
been
my
biggest
discovery
of
the
past
year;
good
writing
is
structurally
beautiful.
The
new
research
methodologies
I
applied
were
limited,
as
the
only
ones
I
was
exposed
to
occurred
first
semester
last
year.
These
however,
(particularly
Murray
and
his
emphasis
on
building
rapport
and
the
non-directive
Nwriter-to-writerO
approach)
were
very
helpful.
These
methodologies
reminded
me
that
I
am
a
student
writer,
just
like
the
student
writers
to
which
I
am
assigned.
Realizing
this
allowed
me
to
engage
in
critical
thought
and
dialogue
with
other
students
not
from
the
standpoint
of
an
authority,
rather
that
of
a
peer.
I
think
this
comes
across
in
my
personal
conferences
during
our
moments
of
introduction
and
continues
throughout
the
semester.
It
is
a
new
expectation
of
my
own
to
continue
in
this
method
and
to
remind
myself
that
I,
too,
have
much
to
learn.
In
terms
of
developing,
changing,
or
establishing
a
writing
identity,
I
feel
as
though
I
am
constantly
shifting.
As
soon
as
I
feel
settled
in
a
particular
mode,
or
have
a
particular
Nset
of
operationsO
for
writing,
inevitably
something
will
happen
that
encourages
me
to
change.
This
past
year,
I
did
notice
a
different
writing
process
taking
place,
which
I
alluded
to
earlier
in
this
narrative.
This
change
had
much
to
do
with
the
way
I
view
drafts
and
really
the
process
piece
of
the
Nwriting
process.OEAgain,
my
new
ability
to
ignore
the
previous
side
of
mine
that
wanted
drafts
to
be
perfect
in
order
to
avoid
drafting
has
found
a
new
side
that
is
happy
taking
more
risks
and
chances,
knowing
that
I
will
change
what
I
wrote
at
least
eight
more
times.
