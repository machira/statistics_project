Literacy
Narrative
In
my
childhood
dreams
I
became
many
different
people.
Within
a
given
week,
my
multitalented
imagination
could
turn
me
into
a
mother,
a
doctor,
a
chef,
a
singer,
a
ballet
dancer,
or
even
a
concert
pianist.
I
never
fancied
myself
as
a
writer,
although
I
do
not
suppose
it
is
too
unusual
for
a
child
to
overlook
such
a
possibility.
Nevertheless,
because
I
feel
that
I
have
a
certain
aptitude
for
writing
and
an
overwhelming
desire
to
become
a
successful
writer,
I
wonder
if
I
haven't
cheated
myself
by
not
realizing
until
late
in
high
school
that
something
special
had
always
lingered
right
in
front
of
me.
I
never
embarked
on
any
recreational
writing
enterprises.
The
only
writing
I
ever
did
on
a
personal
level
was,
I
understand
now,
therapeutic,
and
it
existed
in
the
form
of
letters.
During
the
brutal
years
of
adolescence,
beginning
around
the
fifth
grade,
I
responded
to
problems
that
arose
with
friends
and
non-friends
(which
were
many)
by
writing
letters
to
the
people
involved.
I
would
tell
them
exactly
how
I
felt
(angry,
hurt,
sorry,
etc.),
what
I
thought,
and
why
I
thought
what
they
(or
I)
said
or
did
was
wrong,
among
other
things.
I
never
mustered
the
courage
to
deliver
these
letters,
and
they
were
ultimately
destroyed.
I
kick
myself
when
I
think
of
it
now
because
I
never
understood
what
I
was
doing,
that
writing
was
becoming
an
important
part
of
my
life,
and
because
I
still
thought
of
it
only
as
putting
words
on
paper.
It
wasn't
until
much
later
that
writing
became
more
to
me
than
just
something
I
was
supposed
to
do,
a
mere
prerequisite
in
completing
my
elementary
and
secondary
educations.
I
attributed
the
good
grades
I
received
in
English
courses
and
writing
assignments
in
middle
school
and
high
school
to
the
simple
fact
that
I
could
construct
sentences
that
were
grammatically
correct
and
arrange
them
in
a
clear,
coherent
manner.
The
formative
years
bore
many
writing
assignments,
all
of
which
I
thoroughly
and
diligently
completed
and
which
received
a
positive,
if
not
overly
enthusiastic,
response.
I
can
remember
certain
assignments
and
the
grades
received,
but
can
recall
very
little
about
the
things
I
actually
wrote;
the
grade
was
the
most
important
thing,
and
to
me,
an
A
on
a
writing
assignment
was
exactly
the
same
as
an
A
on
a
math
or
science
test.
Suddenly,
in
tenth
grade
English,
writing
became
the
main
event.
On
the
first
day,
Mr.
McKeon
informed
the
class
that
we
would
be
keeping
journals.
I
remember
thinking,
"Is
he
serious?
What
for?"
I
was
afraid
I
wouldn't
do
well
in
that
class
because
I
wasn't
good
at
creative
or
spontaneous
writing.
I
was
nervous
when
it
was
my
turn
to
approach
the
desk
with
my
response
to
the
first
assignment,
a
brief
autobiography.
I
fidgeted
and
shifted
my
weight
back
and
forth
as
he
perused
my
life
story.
When
he
said,
"You
write
well,"
and
looked
up,
I
gave
an
appreciative
nod,
feeling
only
more
embarrassed.
No
teacher
had
said
it
so
bluntly
before.
Returning
to
my
seat,
I
began
to
wonder
(and
still
do)
what
it
means
to
"write
well,"
and
who
decides
what
is
"well-written."
By
the
end
of
that
year,
I
did
not
have
an
answer
to
that
question,
but,
having
gotten
used
to
daily
journal
entries
and
regular
writing
assignments,
I
found
that
I
had
acquired
a
skill
that
I
could
always
use
to
my
advantage.
In
twelfth
grade,
everything
changed.
I
had
begun
to
notice
how
much
more
excited
I
would
get
over
a
positive
response
to
a
paper
I
had
written
than
over
a
good
grade
on
an
exam
or
lab.
Miss
Renzetti,
my
Advanced
Placement
English
teacher,
was
ecstatic
about
my
first
attempt
at
a
critical
analysis
paper,
in
which
I
analyzed
E.
M.
Forster's
A
Passage
to
India.
Critical
analyses
were
due
every
two
weeks
on
a
different
book
from
her
master
list,
and
were
an
addition
to
the
regular
course
work.
As
subsequent
A's
accumulated
through
the
year,
including
such
comments
as
"great
writing,"
and
"consider
writing
professionally,"
I
felt
very
encouraged,
but
also
grew
a
bit
wary.
Surely,
there
must
have
been
some
things
I
could
work
on.
Partly
because
of
my
self-critical
nature
and
my
refusal
to
believe
that
I
could
be
"great"
at
anything,
and
partly
because
of
my
generally
skeptical
nature,
I
began
to
wonder
if
the
opinions
of
the
teachers
I
had
encountered
over
the
years
really
carried
any
weight.
I
wondered
if
they
were
only
blowing
smoke
up
my
nose
to
boost
my
self-confidence.
I
never
found
those
answers
either,
but
the
year
overall
was
rewarding.
I
had
finally
found
something
I
was
good
at,
but
I
also
found
it
intriguing
and
challenging;
it
was
something
I
could
feel
rewarded
in
doing,
both
for
myself
and
for
others.
Probably
the
worst
experience
I've
had
in
my
short
career
as
a
writer
involved
what
I,
at
the
time,
considered
to
be
a
monumental
loss.
The
last
critical
analysis
paper
I
was
supposed
to
do
for
my
AP
English
class
was
on
Toni
Morrison's
Beloved.
I
was
impressed
with
the
novel,
and
had
spent
much
time
making
notes,
and
finally
spent
an
entire
day
and
night
writing
the
final
draft
on
my
computer.
It
was
the
first
time
I
actually
felt
satisfied
with
something
I
had
written.
When
I
saved
it
to
a
disk
to
print
from
another
computer,
the
disk
turned
out
to
be
corrupt
and
I
lost
the
entire
file.
When
I
finally
accepted
that
it
could
not
be
retrieved,
I
began
sobbing.
I
was
not
concerned
about
my
grade,
but
about
the
amount
of
work
that
had
been
wasted,
the
fact
that
I
had
finally
written
a
paper
that
I
felt
was
good
and
it
was
simply
lost
before
I
even
had
a
chance
to
appreciate
it.
In
hindsight,
it
was
just
one
paper.
Given
time
to
regroup,
I
easily
could
have
produced
a
similar,
if
not
superior
paper.
A
year
later,
when
I
saw
the
required
readings
for
my
first
college
English
class,
Literary
Questions,
I
wondered
if
there
wasn't
a
greater
power
at
work
here.
Beloved
was
one
of
the
assigned
texts,
and
I
felt
sure
there
would
be
at
least
one
paper
assigned
using
it.
I
thought
it
was
an
opportunity
for
redemption,
but
I
now
realize
that
it
was
an
opportunity
for
growth.
The
second
paper
I
wrote
on
the
novel
was
a
much
more
mature,
focused
paper;
it
was
a
reader
response
criticism,
instead
of
a
general
analysis.
Having
previous
experience
with
the
text
helped
me
feel
more
confident
in
writing
about
it
at
the
college
level.
The
best
day
of
my
entire
freshman
year,
of
my
entire
academic
career,
was
the
day
I
met
for
a
conference
with
the
professor
to
discuss
the
paper
on
Beloved.
I
was
very
anxious
to
know
if
someone
with
a
professor's
knowledge
and
experience
would
find
anything
good
or
promising
about
my
writing.
I
think
my
heart
stopped
when
he
opened
the
conference
with,
"Where'd
you
learn
to
write
like
that?"
I
remember
simultaneously
feeling
shocked
and
elated,
and
thinking,
"Write
like
what?"
Instead,
I
managed
a
timid
"I
don't
know,"
and
sat
down,
a
bit
shaken.
We
went
on
to
discuss
my
paper,
my
limited
experience
in
interpreting
and
writing
about
literature,
and
the
possibilities
of
a
major
in
English.
I
expressed
my
concern
that
I
didn't
feel
I
had
been
taught
enough
about
literature
and
literary
criticism,
that
I
had
been
interpreting
and
writing
purely
on
instinct.
I
was
assured
that
English
would
be
a
good
major
for
me,
and
that
I
would
acquire
the
skills
and
knowledge
I
need
in
the
various
courses
offered
by
the
department.
Having
read
two
of
my
papers
so
far,
the
professor
commented
that
I
seemed
to
have
a
tendency
toward
adopting
unconventional
interpretations,
while
still
being
able
to
present
coherent,
convincing
arguments;
he
suggested
this
may
be
the
result
of
not
having
been
exposed
to
any
particular
ways
of
thinking
and
writing
about
literature.
I
only
hope
that,
if
that
is
true,
it
will
continue
to
work
to
my
advantage.
I
rushed
back
to
my
room,
still
shocked,
still
overjoyed,
and
called
each
of
my
parents
at
work
to
tell
them
what
happened.
They,
of
course,
claimed
to
not
be
surprised.
My
father
had
often
told
me
that
reading
my
writing,
when
I
let
him,
was
like
riding
a
bike
downhill.
I
was
pretty
sure
I
knew
what
he
meant,
but
I
thought
he
was
just
being
Dad,
or
maybe
he
didn't
get
to
read
much
beyond
the
scientific
journals
he
was
used
to.
I
was
just
happy
to
finally
have
some
positive
feedback
from
a
professor,
someone
whose
evaluation
I
could
trust.
Although
I
don't
expect
every
professor
I
encounter
to
have
the
same
reaction
to
my
work,
and
although
I
don't
expect
to
produce
the
best
possible
writing
at
every
attempt,
I
finally
feel
confident,
at
least,
that
I
have
a
good
foundation
on
which
to
build.
Within
the
past
two
years,
after
seeming
to
have
appeared
out
of
nowhere,
writing
has
become
the
most
visible
aspect
of
my
academic
life.
At
one
time,
I
never
gave
it
much
thought;
then,
all
of
a
sudden,
it
was
all
I
cared
about.
It
soon
came
alive
as
more
than
a
tool
for
academic
discourse;
it
became
an
art,
a
creative
form
of
communication,
expression,
and
self-discovery.
As
I
prepare
for
sophomore
year,
I
am
anxious
to
continue
growing,
learning,
and
improving
my
writing,
as
well
as
to
contribute
to
the
growth
of
other
writers.
