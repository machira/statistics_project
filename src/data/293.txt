It
has
been
close
to
fifteen
years
since
my
first
writing
experience,
or
so
my
mother
tells
me,
and
it
is
needless
to
say
that
a
great
deal
of
personal
literary
development
has
taken
place
since
I
copied
my
name
for
the
first
time
onto
a
piece
of
blue
construction
paper.
However,
despite
all
this
elapsed
time,
and
despite
my
continually
changing
writing
style,
my
perception
of
and
Attitude
toward
writing
has
remained
constant.
Writing
was,
is,
and
unfortunately,
probably
always
will
be
nothing
more
than
a
chore
to
be
completed
and
then
forgotten.
I
understand
that
this
might
sound
juvenile
or
unscholarly,
but
it
is
not
to
say
that
I
consider
writing
valueless,
or
even
that
I
don't
take
pride
and
satisfaction
in
my
writing,
because
surely
I
do.
Writing
has
always
been
just
writing,
and
perhaps
that
puts
me
at
a
greater
risk
to
write
an
uninteresting
history
as
a
writer,
but
I'll
forge
ahead.
I
can't
honestly
say
that
I
remember
too
many
writing
experiences
prior
to
my
adolescence,
but
my
mother
is
a
reliable
resource.
I've
been
told
that
while
she
sat
at
the
kitchen
table,
filling
out
paperwork
and
paying
bills,
I
would
sit
directly
across
from
her
with
a
pen
and
single
piece
of
paper,
doing
my
best
to
imitate
her
motions.
At
this
age
writing
was
new
and
exciting,
and
just
being
able
to
put
the
letters
of
my
name
together
could
be
a
major
achievement
for
the
day.
I
wish
I
could
remember
these
times
better,
but
I
can't,
so
little
is
left
to
say
about
my
pre-scholastic
writing
experiences.
What
few
memories
I
have,
however,
are
very
positive
because
they
remind
me
of
a
time
when
writing
wasn't
about
grammar,
sentence
structure,
or
deadlines.
Throughout
my
primary
and
secondary
schooling,
I
have
always
considered
writing
a
strength
of
mine,
and
I've
always
believed
that
in
any
situation,
under
almost
any
circumstances,
I
could
write
well.
This
confidence
is
not
the
result
of
any
one
writing
sample
or
specific
event,
but
there
are
certain
memories
of
writing
success
that
stand
out
in
my
mind.
In
the
fifth
grade,
toward
the
end
of
the
school
year,
my
teacher
approached
me
after
class
and
asked
if
I
would
do
her
a
favor.
She
had
some
documents
that
she
had
hand-written
herself,
and
because
she
was
dissatisfied
with
her
own
handwriting,
she
asked
me
to
copy
them
for
her.
Although
this
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
my
writing
style,
or
anything
else
for
that
matter
with
the
exception
of
my
better-than-average
handwriting,
I
remember
feeling
very
proud
of
myself.
It's
possible
that
I
took
my
teacher's
request
as
more
of
a
compliment
than
it
actually
was,
but
the
effect
was
a
substantial
increase
in
my
confidence
as
a
student
and
as
a
writer.
Only
a
year
later,
as
I
was
wrapping
up
my
sixth
grade
year
and
finishing
elementary
school,
I
was
again
commended
for
my
writing.
My
teacher
assigned
the
entire
class
a
five-page
research
paper,
which
was
quite
a
task
for
a
sixth
grader
who
had
never
done
any
literary
research
in
his
life.
In
an
attempt
to
motivate
our
unenthusiastic
class,
our
teacher
told
us
that
she
would
enter
our
papers
into
a
contest
run
by
the
Women's
Ancient
Order
of
Hibernia.
First
prize
was
one
hundred
dollars,
which
was
more
than
enough
to
motivate
our
entire
class.
I
worked
as
hard
on
that
paper
as
I
had
ever
worked
on
anything,
and
the
end
result
was
one
hundred
dollars,
a
first
place
certificate,
and
more
confidence
than
any
sixth-grade
writer
probably
needs.
It
was
another
pat
on
the
back,
the
last
of
many
that
I
had
received
as
a
writer
in
elementary
school.
As
I
continued
intermediate
school,
the
kinds
of
writing
I
was
asked
to
produce
became
much
more
sophisticated
than
the
simple
tasks
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
grade.
Research
papers
became
common
assignments,
and
a
ten
pager
was
looming
at
the
end
of
my
eighth
grade
year.
JAy
world
civilization
teacher
gave
his
students
the
choice
of
any
event
in
any
historical
period
that
we
had
covered
as
a
topic
for
his
enormous
final
paper,
which
he
exaggerated
as
being
much
more
difficult
than
it
actually
was.
The
class
spent
nearly
two
months
researching
and
preparing
their
papers,
and
since
our
teacher
put
no
limit
on
the
number
of
pages
that
could
be
turned
in,
some
students
went
well
above
the
ten-page
minimum.
I,
however,
was
sitting
at
my
computer
the
night
before
the
paper
was
due
with
exactly
four
and
a
half
sentences
staring
back
at
me
from
the
computer
screen.
Needless
to
say,
it
was
a
long
night,
and
I
turned
in
the
paper
the
next
day
completely
convinced
that
I
would
be
receiving
a
grade
my
parents
had
never
seen
.
before.
Two
weeks
later,
my
teacher
handed
me
my
research
paper
and
congratulated
me
on
a
very
respectable
88.
I
wish
I
had
gotten
a
D
on
that
paper.
It
was
a
missed
opportunity
to
learn
that
procrastination
doesn't
pay,
which
is
a
lesson
I
still
haven't
learned.
Once
again,
my
confidence
as
a
writer
swelled,
and
I
entered
high
school
afraid
of
everything
but
the
papers
I
would
have
to
write.
Very
few
things
stand
out
in
my
mind
about
the
writing
I
did
in
high
school.
The
repetitive
nature
of
many
of
the
writing
assignments
I
did
makes
all
four
years
somewhat
blend
together,
but
I
still
believe
that
a
great
deal
of
personal
literary
growth
took
place.
The
concept
of
analytical
writing
was
introduced,
and
writing
became
more
challenging
than
it
had
ever
been.
Up
until
that
point
I
had
been
asked
to
summarize,
narrate,
persuade,
etc.,
but
never
had
I
been
asked
to
really
think
before
I
wrote.
My
freshman
year
I
wrote
a
less
than
stellar
paper
on
A
Light
in
the
Forest,
mainly
because
character
analysis
was
a
new
concept
and
I
wasn't
sure
how
to
approach
it,
but
partially
because
I
didn't
put
a
great
deal
of
effort
into
that
paper.
However,
it
was
a
scary
time
for
me,
and
for
the
first
time
I
doubted
my
writing
capabilities.
This
period,
despite
how
brief
it
was,
marked
a
change
in
the
way
I
approached
writing.
The
uncertainty
was
humbling,
and
that
grade
was
the
lowest
I
would
receive
on
any
writing
assignment
in
high
school.
Graduation
from
high
school
was
much
like
graduation
from
intermediate
school
in
that
I
was
unconcerned
about
writing
at
the
next
level.
My
expectations
about
college
level
writing
were
that
the
papers
would
be
longer
and
I
might
have
to
use
a
few
bigger
words.
It
was
the
attention
to
detail
that
I
was
most
unprepared
for,
and
I
quickly
learned
that
filler
wasn't
going
to
satisfy
my
college
professors.
One
or
two
meaningless
sentences
a
page
could
be
ignored
by
my
high
school
teachers,
and
I
would
sometimes
slip
them
in
only
because
I
knew
I
could.
One
or
two
meaningless
sentences
could
ruin
an
entire
page
for
my
college
professors,
and
once
again
I
was
forced
to
adapt
and
develop
my
writing
style.
Also,
research
took
on
an
entirely
different
meaning
at
the
college
level.
No
longer
would
an
encyclopedia
and
a
few
websites
be
a
sufficient
amount
of
material
to
produce
a
paper.
It
was
a
foreign
notion
to
have
to
devote
hours
and
hours
to
research
alone
and
it
seemed
that
all
of
my
shortcuts
were
disappearing.
Despite
all
these
misconceptions,
I
never
felt
like
I
wasn't
prepared,
possibly
because
I
was
willing
and
able
to
make
all
of
the
necessary
adjustments.
When
my
FYS
professor
handed
back
a
rough
draft
with
more
red
than
black
ink
on
it,
changes
were
made
and
the
paper
improved.
My
best
work,
at
least
on
the
first
draft,
might
not
be
good
enough,
and
in
this
way
I
learned
that
my
best
could
always
get
better.
This
sort
of
development
in
my
writing
has
been
the
most
satisfying
by
far,
and
for
the
first
time
since
crayons
and
blue
construction
paper,
writing
is
close
to
enjoyable.
My
worst
experience
as
a
writer
happened
just
recently,
and
interestingly
enough,
it
was
my
first
real
attempt
at
a
creative
form
of
writing.
A
doctor
misinformed
me
about
the
severity
of
a
personal
injury,
and
because
I
was
scared
and
didn't
want
to
scare
the
people
close
to
me,
I
tried
to
put
my
fear
on
paper.
After
struggling
for
hours
and
erasing
every
other
sentence
I
wrote,
it
occurred
to
me
how
useless
my
activity
was.
Years
and
years
of
mindless
writing
had
never
prepared
me
for
a
time
when
my
own
emotion
would
motivate
me
to
write.
What
I
had
assumed
that
I
could
do,
and
what
I
eventually
realized
that
I
couldn't,
was
make
the
words
more
than
just
words.
Earlier
I
stated
that
I
believe
I
can
write
well
under
almost
any
circumstances.
This
was
the
almost.
It's
reassuring
to
think
that
most
of
my
literary
development
is
ahead
of
me,
because
I'm
sure
I
have
a
long
way
to
go.
I
look
forward
to
my
future
as
a
Writing
Associate,
if
not
only
to
help
fellow
students,
than
also
to
continue
and
facilitate
my
own
growth
as
a
writer.
The
day
when
writing
becomes
more
than
just
writing
and
words
become
more
than
just
words
may
be
right
around
the
corner.
