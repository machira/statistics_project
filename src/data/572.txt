Reading
to
Write
I
have
to
admit
that
for
a
very
important
part
of
my
life,
I
was
not
a
writer.
I
was
just
a
reader.
My
appreciation
for
written
language
began
from
the
other
side
of
the
paper,
when
I
was
very
young.
I
began
to
learn
to
read
in
front
of
a
pool,
while
my
bothers
played
with
a
ball
in
it,
taught
by
my
aunt
and
using
a
book
that
related
names
and
drawings.
I
can
remember
that
I
learned
to
read
faster
than
my
twin
brother,
and
I
can
also
recall
how
I,
not
mature
enough
to
realize
the
frustration
he
probably
felt,
made
him
fail
in
his
attempt
to
read
the
adds
and
signs
we
saw
while
my
mother
drove,
by
reading
what
was
written
as
fast
and
loud
as
I
could.
I
remember
receiving
books
instead
of
toys
for
my
birthdays,
not
because
I
asked
for
them
directly,
because
where
I
come
from
birthday
gifts
are
intended
to
be
a
surprise,
and
not
the
result
of
a
petition,
but
because
my
parents
probably
saw
a
genuine
interest
in
what
now
I
consider
one
of
the
most
productive
and
enlightening
activities
invented
by
humans,
if
not
the
most.
There
used
to
be
a
series
of
books
that
came
in
different
colors,
depending
on
the
intended
age
of
the
reader.
Starting
from
red
for
three
to
five-year-old
children,
followed
by
blue,
yellow,
and
orange,
these
last
ones
addressed
to
teenagers.
I
still
have
the
complete
collection,
and
even
if
I
finished
them
before
I
was
supposed
to,
sometimes
I
still
randomly
pick
one
up
and
surrender
to
one
of
the
most
beautiful
experiences
I
have
ever
had:
the
remembrance
of
an
age
in
which
innocence
still
let
me
amaze
myself
after
discovering,
for
example,
the
story
of
the
love
felt
by
a
boy
towards
Mara
Virginia,
a
girl
that
was
out
of
his
reach,
as
sawn
by
Sindo
Pacheco
Sosa,
a
Cuban
childrenOs
writer.
I
can
recall
reading
The
Bible,
from
the
first
to
the
last
page,
partly
because
I
thought
books
were
written
to
be
read
that
way,
and
partly
because
of
my
interest
on
religion,
that
topic
that
once
had
been
so
mysterious,
and
that
now,
with
a
book
of
curious
and
interesting
stories
and
anecdotes,
exposed
itself
as
clear
as
possible,
or
so
I
thought.
I
do
not
remember
writing
much
during
this
time
of
my
life,
that
is,
before
what
is
known
as
middle
school.
I
can
recall,
though,
that
I
was
forced
to
write
in
cursive
and
with
pencil,
and
that
I
used
to
finish
copying
what
professors
dictated
much
faster
than
most
of
my
classmates.
But
then,
as
I
changed
schools,
a
series
of
events,
that
might
seem
unimportant
and
trivial
to
many,
turned
me
into
a
writer.
In
sixth
grade,
I
had
very
good
teachers
for
both
my
English
and
Spanish
classes.
They
gave
me
fundamental
grammar
lessons,
and
complemented
the
courses
with
enriching
literature.
During
this
year
I
was
able
to
learn
what
I
consider
two
totally
different
points
of
view
of
the
same
matter.
I
learnt
the
basic
tools
needed
to
communicate
ideas
using
the
written
language,
but
in
this
case,
in
both
Spanish
and
English.
This
made
me
understand
that
even
when
languages
may
seem
totally
different,
there
are
some
basic
underlying
principles,
probably
based
on
human
history
and
cognition,
which
make
writing
a
common
tool
for
every
human
being.
During
this
same
year,
I
had
the
chance
to
take
a
typing
course.
Due
to
school
politics,
we
were
forced
to
learn
to
type
in
typewriters,
even
if
computers
were
already
common
and
widely
used
by
students.
This
forced
me
to
learn
to
type
caring
for
all
kind
of
mistakes,
because
they
were
much
harder
to
hide
or
correct
than
they
are
when
typing
on
a
computer.
As
years
has
passed,
I
have
realized
how
useful
this
course
was,
and
how
it
has
facilitated
my
writing
experience
in
front
of
a
computer.
After
this
grade,
I
started
writing
and
continued
reading,
improving
my
skills
in
both
activities,
and
becoming
each
time
more
interested
in
them.
In
tenth
grade,
I
had
a
very
demanding
English
professor,
who
taught
me
to
expand
my
writing
abilities
to
different
courses,
including
some
in
which
I
never
thought
writing
was
fundamental,
such
as
hard-science
courses.
Her
course
also
encourage
me
to
release
my
imagination
and
my
hand
writing
skills,
by
making
me
write
short
essays
about
the
different
books
I
had
to
read
for
class.
At
the
beginning,
writing
these
short
essays
in
a
fifty
minutes
class-period
was
really
difficult,
but
as
the
year
went
by,
I
began
feeling
more
comfortable
with
it,
finding
it
easier
each
time,
and
getting
better
results
in
less
time
an
with
less
effort.
During
this
same
year
I
read
several
books
that
I
think
have
influenced
me
to
a
great
extent
not
only
in
the
way
a
write,
but
also
in
the
way
I
think.
I
read
books
like
One
Hundred
Years
of
Solitude,
from
Gabriel
Garca
Mrquez,
a
Colombian
Nobel
Writer,
Crime
and
Punishment,
The
Stranger,
The
Metamorphosis,
Faust,
and
Madame
Bovary.
All
these
books
made
me
feel
a
deepest
interest
in
literature,
and
woke
up
an
inner
writer
I
didnOt
know
I
had.
I
started
writing
short
articles
in
the
schoolOs
newspaper,
and
started
some
private
writing,
which
I
still
do
when
I
feel
the
need
to.
But
it
wasnOt
until
eleventh
grade,
Colombian
equivalent
to
Senior
High
School
year,
that
I
seriously
started
writing.
And
again,
some
school
and
out-of-school
experiences
helped
me
continue
growing
in
my
limited
knowledge
of
this
endless
learning
process.
First
of
all,
I
took
my
second
philosophy
course,
and
I
explored
many
different
ways
of
thinking,
as
conceived
by
the
authors
themselves,
because
I
was
not
given
a
school
textbook,
but
just
photocopies
of
each
of
the
authorsO
works.
I
read
books
from
philosophers
like
Plato,
Aristotle,
Saint
Thomas
Aquinas,
Saint
Anselm,
Descartes,
Spinoza,
Leibniz,
Hume,
Kant
and
Nietzsche.
The
reading
of
these
authors
caused
without
doubt
a
very
important
shift
in
the
way
I
wrote,
and
the
subjects
I
wrote
about,
not
to
mention
the
way
I
thought.
For
my
last
English
course,
I
had
what
many
would
call
an
unorthodox
professor.
He
had
studied
Art
and
Philology,
and
was
focused
on
showing
us
a
different
way
of
seeing
Literature,
Writing
and
Reading.
He
taught
us
different
writing
methods
such
as
free
writing,
automatism,
the
NCut-upO
technique,
and
echo
writing.
I
did
not
know
any
of
them,
and
being
able
to
experience
such
amazing
possibilities
gave
me
confidence
in
experimenting
and
playing
with
the
huge
potential
of
languages.
By
chance,
that
same
year
I
was
offered
a
scholarship
to
experiment
a
new
method
in
learning
languages.
I
was
given
free
forty
hours
of
Italian,
French,
German
and
English
courses.
As
I
already
knew
English,
I
only
took
Italian,
French
and
German.
It
was
an
incredible
experience,
which
allowed
me
to
find
a
lot
more
relationships
between
theses
languages,
and
those
that
I
already
spoke,
Spanish
and
English.
Using
a
very
intuitive
method,
based
on
the
way
a
child
learns
to
speak,
and
then
write,
the
courses
were
completely
taught
in
the
correspondent
language,
even
during
the
first
class.
When
I
finished
the
program,
I
decided
to
continue
learning
only
French,
and
did
so
for
a
year
in
a
very
intense
schedule.
At
the
end,
I
was
able
to
read
several
books,
such
as
Candide
and
Papa
Goriot,
that
I
had
read
before
either
in
English
or
Spanish,
but
this
time
in
French,
a
possibility
that
had
never
crossed
my
mind
before,
but
that
showed
me
how
gratifying
it
is
to
be
able
to
read
anything
in
the
language
it
was
written.
During
this
same
year,
I
had
a
completely
Spanish
Writing
course
at
school.
I
wrote
four
research
papers
throughout
the
year,
which
helped
me
strengthen
my
research
skills,
as
well
as
my
ability
to
present
clear
and
coherent
essays.
Among
these
four
papers,
I
wrote
one
about
education.
It
was
called
NLa
educacin
en
Colombia:
transicin
de
un
model
heteroestructurante
a
uno
interestructuranteO
(NColombian
education:
Transition
from
an
heterostructured
to
a
interstructured
modelO).
In
general
terms,
it
exposed
a
brief
history
of
school
education,
the
different
general
types
of
education
that
have
been
used
in
modern
civilization,
their
pros
and
cons,
the
current
educational
method
employed
in
Colombia,
based
on
my
own
experience,
and
how
I
think
it
could
be
improved.
I
got
very
good
feedback
from
my
professor,
so
I
decided
to
write
an
article
for
the
school
newspaper
based
on
it,
but
focused
on
what
had
been
a
growing
tendency
of
the
students
committing
intellectual
fraud,
the
low
attention
that
professors
had
paid
to
them,
and
my
concern
about
the
matter.
As
expected,
the
article
was
not
well
received
by
the
students,
but
what
really
surprised
me
was
that
professors
seemed
to
be
bothered
by
what
for
me
was
just
a
fair
claim
for
basic
honesty.
My
Spanish
professor
organized
an
in-class
debate
about
the
subject,
and
made
me
confront
the
arguments
exposed
against
my
article.
It
was
almost
a
one
versus
the-whole-class-minus-one
debate,
but
patiently
I
sat
down
and
listened
while
my
classmates
exposed
their
arguments.
I
wrote
them
down,
while
I
took
some
notes
about
each
of
them,
and
whenever
they
finished
saying
what
they
had
to
say,
I
stood
up
and
answered
each
argument,
one
by
one.
At
the
end,
and
after
a
prolonged
silence,
I
received
a
round
of
applause
from
all
my
classmates.
I
never
saw
that
coming,
but
that,
and
a
quote
of
my
professor
after
the
class
was
over,
NLadran
Sancho,
luego
cabalgamosO
(NThey
bark
Sancho,
then
we
rideO
as
found
in
Don
Quixote),
has
probably
been
the
most
gratifying
experience
born
in
something
I
wrote
I
have
ever
had.
All
those
small
experiences
influenced
my
writing
positively,
and
after
school,
and
when
I
came
to
college,
I
was
surprised
to
find
out
that
my
writing
skills
were,
at
least,
as
good
as
those
of
an
average
native
English
speaker.
I
was
even
more
surprised
when
in
the
first
paper
I
wrote
for
my
First
Year
Seminar,
my
assigned
Writer
Associate
told
me
that,
except
for
some
few
mistakes,
my
writing
skills
did
not
evidence
that
English
was
my
second
language.
During
this
first
year
at
college,
I
was
also
able
to
help
some
of
my
friends
and
dorm
mates
with
their
Spanish
papers.
They
came
to
me
with
all
types
of
questions,
some
of
them
just
looking
for
a
short
answer,
but
many
expecting
an
explanation.
I
did
not
have
any
problem
helping
them,
and
with
the
help
of
a
couple
dictionaries
and
thesauruses,
and
information
found
online,
I
was
able
to
solve
all
their
doubts,
some
of
which
also
enlightened
me
in
topics
I
did
not
know,
remember,
or
I
was
not
sure
about.
Lastly,
and
as
side
activity,
I
have
been
writing
a
blog
about
my
life
since
I
left
my
country
to
come
to
study
abroad.
Since
I
type
it
on
the
computer,
and
thanks
to
that
typing
class
I
took
in
school,
it
does
not
take
me
a
lot
of
time,
and
it
is
something
very
important
that
I
do
for
my
family
and
my
friends,
but
also,
and
mostly,
for
me,
because
itOs
a
way
to
record
my
present,
and
thus,
create
my
past.
That
is
how
I
have
been
growing
as
a
writer,
and
I
expect
to
be
able
to
continue
in
this
endless
learning
experience,
which
for
me
should
be
a
basic
part
of
all
human
beings.
