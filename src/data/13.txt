WA
Writing
Assignment
Some
activities
that
were
difficult
for
other
children
to
master
came
easily
to
me.
One
such
exercise
was
writing.
My
best
friend
in
elementary
school,
Melissa,
had
difficulty
because
she
was
dyslexic;
another
classmate
couldn't
seem
to
grasp
the
concept
of
including
more
than
three
words
in
a
sentence.
For
me,
writing
was
not
a
particularly
hard
task.
I
simply
wrote
what
I
thought
and
the
reader
would
usually
comment
that
my
writing
was
great
or
funny
.
Of
course,
at
first
the
readers
were
my
parents
and
I,
being
the
eldest
child,
proudly
thought
that
I
was
the
first
child
to
learn
to
write,
as
most
parents
probably
make
their
children
feel.
This
type
of
positive
commenting
allowed
me
to
gain
confidence
as
a
writer,
even
as
a
young
child.
I
was
never
forced
to
question
whether
my
writing
was
good
enough
as
some
students
were.
As
far
as
I
can
remember,
my
only
criticism
as
an
elementary
school
writer-in-progress
was
my
cursive
writing.
I
seldom
had
difficulty
formulating
the
basis
for
a
story
and
was
somehow
able
to
construct
grammatically
correct
narratives.
Thus,
I
enjoyed
writing.
That
is...until
the
difficult
material
came
my
way.
I
clearly
remember
my
seventh
grade
Language
Arts
teacher,
Mr.
Swan,
trying
to
help
me
master
sentence
diagraming.
This
was
probably
one
of
the
first
times
I
had
big
difficulty
with
writing.
Mr
Swan
would
say,
Debbie,
you
can
write
complex
sentences
correctly,
now
you
just
have
to
learn
the
names
for
each
part
of
the
sentence.
This,
to
me
was
a
conspiracy
designed
to
leave
me
hating
writing
altogether.
I
experienced
a
great
deal
of
trauma
while
trying
to
decipher
the
difference
between
a
gerund
and
a
predicate
participle.
Thankfully,
Mr.
Swan
was
able
to
assure
me
that
I
should
not
be
discouraged
from
writing
completely.
My
earliest
memory
of
a
real
English
paper
falls
in
the
beginning
of
my
eighth
grade
year.
Ms.
MacDonald
was
a
stickler
for
grammar
and
spelling
and
our
major
assignment
was
a
research
paper.
For
several
days,
our
class
time
was
spent
in
the
Library
for
research
purposes
and
we
had
to
utilize
a
minimum
of
six
sources.
This
project
was
a
daunting
one
as
Ms.
MacDonald
also
required
us
to
hand
in
a
preliminary
outline,
a
list
of
sources,
several
note
cards,
and
a
final
outline
before
the
paper
itself
was
due.
For
me,
this
was
a
chore
because
I
had
always
been
a
last
minute
paper
writer.
I
thought
that
preparing
ahead
would
cramp
my
style
.
In
actuality,
the
project
helped
to
achieve
the
opposite
effect.
The
research
project
was
one
of
my
best
pieces
of
work
that
year.
I
found
that
early
preparation
for
English
papers
and
for
most
other
things
was
usually
the
best
formula
for
success.
I
do
not
claim
that
I
don't
procrastinate
at
all
but
I
brainstorm
about
my
writing
long
before
it
ever
gets
on
paper.
My
method
is
not
that
different
from
Ms.
MacDonald's
but
I
create
my
preliminary
work
in
my
head.
The
worst
memory
I
have
of
high
school
writing
occurred
during
the
second
part
of
my
freshman
year.
My
English
teacher,
Ms.
Daly,
was
asked
to
teach
the
ATP
program
because
the
regular
teacher
was
on
sabbatical.
Ms.
Daly
assumed
that
the
ATP
students
should
have
been
far
more
advanced
than
the
regular
level
classes.
This
belief
resulted
in
difficult
grading.
When
I
didn't
do
as
well
as
I
had
previously
done
on
papers,
I
approached
her
and
she
commented
that
my
writing
was
not
up
to
ATP
par
and
I
should
probably
switch
out
of
the
class
and
take
something
easier.
She
continued
that
despite
having
good
content,
my
writing
lacked
form
and
she
didn't
really
like
my
style
of
writing.
I
told
my
parents
and
they
protested,
saying
I
was
a
fine
writer
and
were
outraged
that
a
teacher
would
comment
that
I
wasn't
good
enough
to
be
in
that
particular
class.
They
asked
to
read
my
next
paper
before
it
was
handed
in
so
that
they
would
have
a
better
handle
on
my
writing.
I
was
determined
to
improve
my
writing
on
my
own
and
did
not
show
them
my
next
assignment
before
it
was
turned
in.
It
took
the
rest
of
the
year
but
I
finally
managed
to
get
an
A
on
a
paper
for
her
class.
The
lesson
I
learned
that
year
was
that
some
people
have
writing
styles
that
they
like
and
some
that
they
do
not
tolerate.
I
also
came
to
understand
that
a
writer's
style
must
sometimes
be
molded
to
the
reader's
likes
and
dislikes,
particularly
if
the
reader
is
responsible
for
grading.
The
next
writing
experience
that
is
firmly
etched
in
my
mind
is
that
of
the
freewrite.
My
junior
year
English
teachers,
Ms.
Hammill
and
Mr.
Taylor,
used
the
freewrite
often.
Although
I
had
written
freewrites
prior
to
that
particular
year,
I
had
never
understood
their
purpose.
Throughout
my
junior
year
it
was
required
that
we
write
freewrites
once
a
week
and
time
for
sharing
was
allotted,
is
students
so
desired.
Our
freewrites
were
turned
in,
not
to
be
graded
but
rather
to
be
read
and
commented
upon.
I
found
that
this
method
of
writing
was
a
good
tool
for
me
to
use
in
order
to
organize
and
solidify
my
thoughts.
I
still
use
this
method
as
a
form
of
prewriting
for
college
level
assignments.
My
senior
year
of
English
was
both
the
hardest
high
school
class
I
took
and
also
the
most
rewarding.
The
teacher,
Mr.
Loose,
assigned
a
simple
reaction
homework
piece
but
explained
that
he
would
not
accept
simple
one
paragraph
responses
but
instead
he
wanted
us
to
delve
into
the
reading
and
own
emotions
and
complete
a
three
page
reaction.
To
me,
and
most
of
the
class,
this
assignment
was
incomprehensible.
I
didn't
understand
how
I
was
supposed
to
write
three
whole
pages
on
one
homework
reading.
I
soon
learned.
Mr.
Loose
demanded
and
expected
more
than
any
other
teacher
I
had
ever
had
before.
This
experience
was
both
gratifying
and
frustrating
at
the
same
time.
He
didn't
want
a
student
to
answer
with
one
sentence
statements
but
rather
he
wanted
us
to
argue
our
points
and
try
to
persuade
him
or
other
members
of
the
class
in
our
own
direction.
He
had
the
ability
to
bring
shy
people
out
of
their
shells
through
their
writing
and
to
help
those
inclined
toward
verbal
expression
to
write
what
they
would
normally
say.
This
experience
with
writing
helped
to
shape
my
respect
and
love
for
writing.
I
now
respect
the
process
that
I
and
all
writers
undergo
in
order
to
produce
a
final
product.
The
lesson
I
learned
with
Mr.
Loose
and
still
employ
today
is
to
try
to
overwrite.
If
there
is
too
much
information
it
is
easy
to
cut
some
out
of
the
final
product
but
if
there
is
just
enough
the
reader
might
hope
for
greater
clarification.
Not
until
my
senior
year
did
I
show
my
writing
to
others
for
comments
before
it
was
handed
in.
Traditionally,
I
would
get
the
graded
paper
back,
with
a
grade
that
I
was
proud
of,
before
anyone
besides
the
teacher
and
myself
would
read
my
work.
As
a
result
of
my
senior
year
English
class,
I
learned
the
importance
of
peer
editing
and
criticism
from
and
outside
party
who
is
also
an
informed
reader.
Because
that
English
class
had
been
such
a
challenge,
I
felt
that
I
was
well
prepared
for
what
lay
ahead
in
college
English
courses.
Inevitably,
I
had
been
mistaken.
What
I
found
was
that
I
had
a
good
background
knowledge
of
how
to
write
and
analyze
works
of
literature
but
I
was
not
going
to
be
able
to
breeze
through
English
and
write
papers
of
the
same
caliber
that
I
had
written
in
high
school.
I
found
that
college
was
another
test
of
how
quickly
I
could
figure
out
what
the
teacher
liked
and
how
to
produce
it.
Luckily,
I
had
a
wonderful
First
Year
Seminar
experience
and
although
I
did
feel
overwhelmed
by
the
expectations,
I
also
felt
able
to
meet
the
challenge
and
produce
what
a
college
professor
expected.
This
particular
lesson
evolved
into
trying
to
write
a
good
English
paper
that
the
professor
would
appreciate.
My
next
lesson
seems
like
an
obvious
one
but
it
took
a
second
college
English
course
to
show
me.
As
had
been
so
in
high
school,
I
found
that
not
every
college
English
professor
expected
the
same
things
from
me
as
a
writer.
One
wanted
perfect
grammar
while
the
other
was
concerned
mainly
with
content.
Again,
I
found
that
once
I
got
the
first
assignment
out
of
the
way,
I
was
able
to
better
meet
the
expectations
of
the
course.
I
have
found
that
the
kind
of
writer
I
am
today
has
been
shaped
by
all
of
the
influences
throughout
my
writing
career.
The
worst
memories
helped
me
to
strive
to
improve
my
work
and
the
best
have
become
my
rewards
for
working
harder.
I
find
that
as
the
writing
implements
get
more
complex,
so
do
the
writing
assignments.
When
I
was
young
and
writing
in
crayon,
I
received
little
other
than
praise.
As
I
continued
on
to
the
pencil
and
then
graduated
to
the
pen,
I
found
myself
writing
for
enjoyment
as
well
as
for
school
assignments.
As
the
writing
implement
got
more
precise,
so
did
my
writing.
Writing
became
an
outlet
for
emotions
and
a
way
to
express
myself
to
myself
as
well
as
to
others.
As
the
age
of
computers
dawned
I
began
to
feel
a
selfdoubt
because
my
writing
was
changing.
I
blamed
this
change
on
the
computer
and
tried
writing
whole
papers
out
before
typing
them.
This
method
was
a
waste
of
time
as
my
writing
did
not
revert
back
to
what
it
had
been.
Gradually,
I
realized
that
the
change
was
not
bad,
but
was
actually
evidence
that
I
was
growing
and
maturing
as
a
writer.
Each
year
is
an
advance
toward
becoming
a
better
and
more
intuitive
writer.
I
am
anxiously
awaiting
the
next
step.
