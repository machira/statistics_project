Literacy

August

2005
I,
they
I
start
now.
July
is
slowly
shedding
its
calendar
days
and
I
am
reflecting
on
the
past
four
weeks
that
I
have
spent
as
a
writing
teacher
at
a
theatre
program
for
high
school
students.
I
designed
the
class
using
components
from
the
creative
non-fiction
class
that
I
took
with
professor
Carpenter
along
with
theatre
exercises
and
playwriting
techniques
and
titled
the
class,
Writing
For
the
Actor:
Finding
Your
Voice.
I
bring
this
up
because
it
provides
interesting
contrasts
and
similarities
to
the
Writing
Associate
Position
that
I
noted
throughout
the
four-week
period.
The
principle
of
Nfinding
of
your
voiceO
was
the
objective
that
I
tried
to
instill
in
my
approach
to
my
2004-05
VAST
students,
as
well
as
the
students
this
summer.
Likewise,
it
became
a
subconscious
freedom
of
my
own
in
the
spring
semester.
It
deeply
reflected
the
regeneration
I
felt
I
needed
to
do
with
my
own
writing.
I
knew
I
enjoyed
writing,
that
I
loved
the
process,
but
failed
to
think
of
myself
as
a
writer
because
I
didnOt
have
confidence.
I
fell
in
love
with
the
creative
non-fiction
genre
this
recent
spring
and
began
to
soak
up
as
many
publications,
articles
and
stories
that
I
could.
It
culminated
in
a
final
portfolio
piece,
NOn
Non-Fiction.O
I
wrote
about
the
genreOs
personal
significance
to
me
and
also
how
valuable
the
genre
is
to
all
writers
because
it
requires
you
to
start
with
yourself.
You
value
your
own
experiences,
and
thus,
the
way
that
you
write
them
so
that
you
start
with
your
ideas
as
your
friends.
This
is
not
the
mind-set
I
find
freshman
and
sophomores
having.
When
we
discuss
their
high
school
writing
experience
it
usually
sums
up
to
thesis,
research,
prove,
persuade,
prove!!!!
With
this
cutthroat,
analysis
heavy
style
of
writing,
it
is
no
wonder
writing
is
a
seemingly
impossible
task.
Undoubtedly,
my
style
as
a
WA
is
always
linked
to
my
style
of
writing
or
the
way
that
I
look
at
writing
in
that
moment.
What
I
value
in
my
own
process,
I
try
and
bring
to
my
students.
Spring
was
a
semester
of
questioning
and
experimenting
with
styles.
The
non-fiction
class
was
workshop
based.
We
would
ask
questions,
talk
about
what
was
successful
or
not
successful,
how
and
why
the
piece
worked.
While
these
questions
were
not
new
to
me,
it
increased
quantity
of
questions
that
I
had
and
made
it
easier
to
recognize
what
deserved
questioning.
It
also
decreased
my
fear
of
drafts
and
receiving
feedback.
It
was
interesting,
after
a
year
of
being
a
WA,
to
again
find
myself
on
the
receiving
end
of
questions.
And
I
liked
it.
I
realized,
if
this
experience
is
so
engaging
and
stimulating
to
me,
then
why
couldnOt
students
who
donOt
think
of
themselves
as
NwritersO
have
the
same
experience?
When
I
look
back
to
my
first
year
as
a
WA,
I
think
I
was
more
focused
on
the
tangible
and
written
thoughts
in
front
of
me
and
how
I
could
improve
what
was
on
their
paper.
This
past
year,
I
was
able
to
better
achieve
my
goal
of
helping
them
find
their
voice
by
asking
questionsE.lots
of
questions.
I
didnOt
focus
as
much
on
the
paper
in
front
of
me,
rather
their
thinking
prior
to
the
paper.
Like
my
own
writing,
I
wanted
to
improve
the
brainstorming,
outlining,
thinking
period
that
comes
before
putting
pen
to
paper,
fingers
to
keys.
I
wanted
to
get
them
to
think
about
their
writing.
I
wanted
them
to
gain
a
better
enjoyment
of
the
process
of
writing.
I
wanted
them
to
look
at
how
writing
can
be
a
valuable
form
of
self-expression.
I
wanted
them
to
feel
safe
in
their
writing
and
thinking.
So
rarely
do
students
trust
their
own
voice.
They
donOt
believe
their
voice
to
have
value.
They
are
encouraged
to
take
on
the
voice
of
scholars,
published
authors,
voices
that
have
so
called
NweightO
all
the
while
denying
the
possibility
of
their
ideas.
This
past
spring
and
summer,
I
gave
those
ideas
roots.
I
was
fortunate
to
have
a
professor
(Truten,
dear
manE.how
I
miss
him
so)
that
truly
respected
the
role
of
the
WA
and
assigned
papers
that
started
in
the
territory
of
the
personal.
The
first
assignment
was
to
write
a
deathography,
that
is
choose
two
or
three
profound
deaths
that
have
occurred
for
you
and
simply
write
out
the
events.
The
second
part
to
the
first
paper
was
to
examine
how
those
deaths
influenced
your
beliefs
on
death.
The
second
paper
was
research
based,
but
still
resulted
in
the
student
making
opinions
about
the
events.
The
third
paper
required
the
students
to
write
their
eulogy
from
the
perspective
of
a
loved
one
as
well
as
an
obituary
and
a
list
of
directions
for
their
funeral.
I
re-hash
these
assignments
because
I
am
still
taken
by
their
creative
flexibility
and
as
a
WA,
this
is
a
wonderful
place
to
start.
Having
taken
the
course
before,
accessing
the
concepts
came
easily.
Many
of
the
assignments
and
exercises
I
gave
to
the
students
this
summer
were
in
this
creative
vein.
The
exercises
asked
them
to
tap
into
their
own
histories,
to
develop
their
own
style.
We
talked
a
lot
about
NvoiceO
and
recognizing
the
styles
and
voices
of
various
authors.
In
several
WA
staff
meetings,
we
have
discussed
our
high
school
experiences
of
writing
and
have
looked
back
on
those
experiences
having
already
had
a
year
or
two
of
college
writing
in
our
tool
belts.
This
skews
our
vision.
We
retrieve
a
muddy
imprint
of
the
expectations
of
Nhigh
schoolO
writing
and
also,
what,
in
our
minds,
constituted
NgoodO
writing
at
the
time.
To
witness,
firsthand,
the
impression
of
writing
that
the
high
schoolers
had
was
particularly
informative.
Many
of
them,
as
I
had
guessed,
had
not
been
exposed
to
a
lot
of
creative
writing.
Creative
writing
does
not
have
to
equate
fiction,
rather
free
thinking.
Similar
to
what
I
witnessed
in
my
VAST
students,
writing
was
an
arduous
task.
My
VAST
students
frequently
hid
behind
the
phrase,
Nwell,
IOm
a
really
crappy
writer.O
As
a
Spring
WA,
the
focus
of
my
meetings
was
around
dialogue.
It
reflected
the
conversations
I
would
have
with
myself
about
writing,
as
well
as
the
conversations
that
took
place
in
class
workshops.
Because
the
nature
of
the
VAST
course
(Deliberations
on
Death
&
Dying)
asks
the
students
to
reveal
personal
information,
I
noticed
that
the
tone
in
which
I
presented
questions
changed.
There
was
a
natural
sensitivity
involved
not
only
in
listening
or
reading
about
their
personal
lives,
but
in
advising
them
how
to
convey
such
natural
life
into
their
writing.
Unlike
my
first
WA
year,
my
tone
was
not
didactic.
I
wasnOt
NteachingO
them
anything,
I
was
revealing
skills
that
they
already
had.
A
week
ago,
however,
I
was
a
teacher.
The
nature
of
the
word
NassociateO
took
on
new
meaning
as
I
wrapped
up
my
first
experience
as
a
writing
teacher.
As
a
WA,
I
work
one
on
one
with
the
student
so
that
my
role
is
their
ally,
their
equal.
As
a
teacher,
I
was
in
front
of
the
room,
talking
to
a
group
and
it
was
very
hard
to
dig
into
the
personal
guts
of
a
personOs
writing
fears,
failures,
successes
or
even,
questions.
Through
teaching
I
realized
that
the
work
of
the
WA
is
much
easier.
As
a
WA,
I
work
with
ideas,
organization,
the
body
of
information
presented
and
whether
or
not
the
paper
lines
up
with
the
assignment.
In
my
first
year
as
a
WA,
I
wanted
to
cover
everything
with
them.
I
wanted
to
help
them
with
absolutely
everything.
I
realized
the
immense
feeling
of
relief
I
felt
when
I
put
the
pen
down.
The
margin-scribble
was
not
all
about
word
choice,
but
prompt
questions
on
the
side
that
were
the
same
questions
I
wanted
them
to
answer.
I
experimented
a
lot
more
with
various
methods
of
getting
them
to
talk.
How
do
you
work
with
the
writer
that
hates
writing?
How
do
you
make
writing
exciting
for
them?
How
do
you
help
them
convey
their
own
ideas,
not
the
ideas
of
the
professor,
the
author
or
the
WA?
In
my
second
year
as
a
WA,
I
was
much
more
in
tune
with
the
individual
thinking
processes
of
each
of
my
students.
For
example,
Student
AOs
thinking
began
personally.
Student
A
was
great
at
articulating
what
was
going
on
in
her
head,
but
needed
a
little
push
to
look
beyond
herself.
Student
B,
on
the
other
hand,
focused
a
lot
on
larger
issues
such
as
the
way
death
affects
women
vs.
men,
but
needed
to
be
pushed
to
better
evaluate
her
own
feelings
on
death.
I
did
not
have
this
privilege
two
weeks
ago.
There
was
no
room
for
individual
interactions.
I
truly
understood
my
students
as
individuals
last
spring.
I
knew
that
NCraigO
needed
things
said
slowly
to
him
whereas
NDaraO
needed
me
to
write
out
the
ideas
as
she
spoke
them.
In
my
first
year
as
a
WA
I
recognized
the
needs
of
each
student,
but
this
past
year
came
even
more
naturally.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
provides
the
privilege
of
discussion.
The
more
I
talk
about
writing,
the
better
my
writing
becomes.
This
summer
there
was
not
much
room
to
talk
about
the
process.
I
gained
a
new
appreciation
for
using
25%
of
my
meetings
to
discuss
the
process
of
writing
that
they
faced
with
this
paper,
or
papers
in
general.
Fifty
percent
of
my
meetings
were
devoted
to
the
subject,
assignment
and
draft.
The
remaining
25%
of
the
meeting
was
spent
on
reviewing
what
we
had
said
and
clarifying
any
questions
they
had.
What
I
achieved
in
my
Spring
semester
was
confidence
in
my
writing.
The
year
prior,
I
achieved
various
styles
of
writing.
Because
I
had
achieved
a
confidence
in
my
thinking,
my
processing
and
my
writing,
it
makes
sense
that
my
goal
would
be
to
help
my
VAST
students
find
the
same
confidence.
I
realized
how
it
improved
my
writing
and
made
me
more
willing
to
be
fallible
and
fearless.
I
am
quite
proud
of
my
Spring
O05
work.
My
evaluations
demonstrated
that
I
had
reached
my
goals
of
achieving
a
writing
environment
where
the
students
could
see
writing
as
entertaining,
cathartic,
experimental
and
ultimately,
personal.
I
knew
that
when
students
started
asking
me
to
look
at
multiple
drafts
of
their
paper
that
I
was
making
a
positive
change.
In
the
Fall
semester
of
last
year
I
was
studying
abroad
in
Florence.
I
missed
conversations
about
the
process
of
writing.
I
missed
influencing
students
to
view
writing
in
a
positive
way.
Without
these
conversations
about
writing,
my
own
writing
suffered
when
I
was
abroad.
Coupled
with
not
having
my
own
computer
and
working
at
the
mercy
of
the
computer
lab
schedule,
it
was
the
lack
of
soundboards,
of
listeners,
of
a
group
of
people
that
took
writing
seriously
and
would
talk
about
with
me
that
caused
my
writing
to
take
steps
backwards.
I
focused
a
lot
on
communication
this
past
spring;
the
dialogue
that
I
have
with
myself
when
writing,
the
dialogue
with
other
writers,
the
dialogue
with
my
VAST
students.
I
would
think
in
questions.
What
is
the
best
way
to
get
this
information
across?
How
can
I
better
explain
this
question
to
the
student?
How
can
I
make
this
statement
into
a
question
that
they
can
answer?
Getting
students
to
talk
was
the
best
reward.
The
workshops
in
the
non-fiction
class
also
helped
me
to
balance
positive
and
negative
criticism.
When
forced
to
find
positive
things
(which
were
asked
to
do
in
our
critiques
of
one
anotherOs
papers)
it
also
allowed
me
to
find
the
positive
in
my
own
writing.
I
believe
that
discussion
and
writing
are
the
same.
Talking
about
writing,
a
subject
or
an
idea
is
the
first
impulsive
step.
You
must
talk
before
you
pen
and
you
must
be
comfortable
talking
to
yourself.
I
stopped
fearing
failure
and
I
took
this
lesson
to
my
students
as
well.
Then,
whenever
a
student
would
walk
in
with
the
immediate
excuse
or
warning
that
he/she
is
Nnot
a
good
writerO,
I
would
just
say,
letOs
start
from
the
beginning.
