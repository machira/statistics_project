Essay
Writing
Like
a
WA
The
ability
to
help
others
is
one
of
the
greatest
gifts
that
one
person
can
give
to
another.
In
college,
helping
is
the
root
of
relationships
in
which
both
members
of
the
party,
the
WA
and
the
student
seeking
assistance,
may
and
will
benefit.
For
that
reason,
being
a
WA
has
affected,
among
other
things,
the
way
in
which
I
think
about
writing,
the
writing
process,
and
ultimately,
how
I
write
as
a
student
writer,
both
personally
and
academically.
Being
a
WA,
then,
has
not
only
proven
to
be
a
job,
but
a
type
of
academic
culture,
and
at
minimum,
one
extremely
important
aspect
of
my
student
lifestyle.
As
a
result
of
my
past
year
as
a
Writing
Associate,
each
time
I
sit
down
to
write
a
paper,
I
think
about
the
stylistic
errors/flaws
that
my
fellow
Writing
Associates
and
I
despise
seeing.
As
I
revise
each
draft
of
my
paper,
I
think
about
what
I
would
say
if
this
were
a
paper
that
I
had
been
observing
for
a
student.
Essentially,
whenever
I
write,
as
a
direct
result
of
being
a
WA,
I
think
of
the
role
of
the
WA
in
the
Lafayette
Writing
Program,
and
think
of
all
my
work
as
a
product
of
that
experience.
In
short,
each
paper
is
written
not
from
the
standpoint
of
writing
a
paper,
but
from
the
viewpoint
of
how
I
can
make
this
paper
the
best
it
can
be.
Finally,
when
writing
for
myself
or
for
a
classroom
assignment,
I
think
about
ways
to
refine
my
paper,
for
if
nothing
else,
being
a
WA
has
taught
me
that
no
paper,
no
matter
how
perfected
it
may
seem,
or
how
tired
I
am,
is
flawless:
there
is
always
room
for
one
more
change
because
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
final
finished
product.
The
"final
draft,"
as
it
is
called,
is
not
so
much
a
finished
and
finalized
product
as
it
is
a
draft
where
there
is
no
more
time
left
to
work
upon
it
due
to
the
constraints
of
deadlines,
etc.
That
lesson,
in
of
itself,
has
impacted
my
writing
over
the
past
year.
In
part,
I
believe
this
is
due
to
the
pressures
of
college
life,
where
student
academics
tend
to
seem
rushed
and
goal-oriented,
and
not
always
geared
primarily
towards
the
learning
experience.
Too
often,
students
become
obsessed
with
a
certain
end
result,
such
as
the
grade
desired,
and
lose
sight
of
the
true
purpose
of
the
rigors
of
academic
life:
to
learn.
However,
during
the
past
two
semesters,
my
education
has
been
greatly
supplemented
by
my
role
as
a
WA
and
the
expectations
that
accompany
this
position.
I
am
learning
how
to
write
better
and
I
am
learning
how
to
think
of
myself
as
a
writer.
My
writing
over
the
past
year
has
improved
a
great
deal.
There
are
a
variety
of
classes
that
have
utilized
my
writing
skills
and
in
the
past
year,
I
have
found
that
Government,
Spanish
and
English
courses
have
benefited
the
most
from
my
experiences.
In
those
three
subject
areas,
I
have
employed
my
ever-evolving
writing
skills.
Those
areas
have
reaffirmed
the
knowledge
that
I
know
that
I
like
to
write.
In
part,
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
natures
of
my
courses
are
changing,
as
are
the
expectations
and
levels
of
difficulty.
The
majority
of
the
writing
assignments
that
I
did
this
year
were
formative
to
my
evolution
as
a
writer;
the
experiences
were
also
writing
experiences
that
enabled
me
to
more
fully
develop
as
a
student
writer
and
a
thinker.
My
Government
class
was
challenging,
but
the
writing
was
the
most
interesting
because
each
student
in
the
class
was
able
to
choose
his
or
her
own
topic.
As
I
chose
and
individually
researched
my
topic,
I
was
able
to
hone
my
writing
skills
by
learning
how
to
write
independently.
My
term
project
was
a
paper,
but
it
was
a
paper
written
without
deadlines.
For
example,
there
was
a
final
due
date,
but
there
were
days
when
drafts
or
outlines
or
initial
thesis
statements
were
due
for
a
grade
or
for
feedback
from
the
professor.
In
fact,
aside
from
the
final
due
date
of
the
project,
the
term
project
was
rarely
mentioned
in
class.
It
was
the
responsibility
of
the
student
to
choose
a
topic
and
write
the
paper
in
a
timely
fashion.
Such
complete
freedom
in
the
term
project
was
indeed
a
new
experience
for
me.
I
had
to
learn
how
to
write
not
for
an
external
factor
such
as
a
professor,
but
for
myself.
There
was
a
gigantic
difference
in
that
I
found
that
my
writing
process
was
self-evolved.
I
was
not
writing
thesis
statements
for
a
professor,
by
this,
I
meant
that
I
was
not
writing
my
paper
based
upon
what
I
thought
they
wanted
to
hear
me
say
and
how
that
professor
wanted
me
to
think.
I
was
writing
the
paper
for
myself
and
I
was
writing
the
paper
to
the
best
of
my
ability.
This
type
of
attitude
was
easily
applicable
to
my
Spanish
coursework.
In
my
Spanish
classes,
I
wrote
Spanish.
Writing
in
a
foreign
language
is
even
harder
than
writing
in
my
first
language,
as
I
am
sure
you
can
imagine.
However,
writing
in
a
foreign
language
reinforces
my
writing
process
because
I
do
not
now
all
of
the
intricacies
of
the
language.
Nonetheless,
my
VAST
Class
proved
to
be
the
most
difficult
course
to
write
for
because
the
topic
was
obtuse.
Many
of
the
papers
demanded
an
analytical
focus
and
required
a
great
deal
of
research.
However,
the
topic
itself
was
relatively
new
and
as
a
result,
there
was
not
a
lot
of
easily
available
and
accurate
information
that
I
could
refer
to.
Consequently,
many
of
my
references
stemmed
from
the
Internet
because
published
information
was
far
too
outdated.
However,
what
I
learned
from
that
experience
was
that
writing
is
an
evolutionary
art.
Even
when
it
seemed
as
if
all
there
was
to
say
had
been
written,
there
was
always,
if
one
searched
long
enough,
a
scholar
who
approached
that
very
topic
from
a
different
angle
and
as
a
result,
produced
a
somewhat
different
work.
The
VAST
experience,
then,
taught
me
a
great
deal
about
the
kind
of
person
that
makes
good
writer.
In
my
opinion,
I
learned
that
a
good
writer
is
someone
who
is
patient
and
hardworking.
In
fact,
in
my
VAST,
the
best
writers
were
not
necessarily
those
students
who
were
brilliant,
had
an
excellent
command
of
English
usage
and
grammar,
or
who
could
express
themselves
far
more
eloquently
than
the
professor.
The
best
writers
were
not
necessarily
the
students
who
constantly
earned
A's
or
B's.
From
my
viewpoint,
while
the
aforementioned
traits
were
certainly
beneficial,
the
best
writers
were
those
who
addressed
the
topic
at
hand,
wrote
clearly
and
efficiently,
and
most
importantly
to
the
time
to
write
as
well
as
they
could.
The
best
students
writers
were
patient
with
their
development
throughout
the
writing
process
and
were
able
to
positively
utilize
criticism
by
implementing
suggestions.
Those
types
of
attitudes
not
only
improved
their
writing
in
the
VAST
course,
but
in
their
writing
overall.
People
learn
no
only
from
reading
and
writing
firsthand,
but
also
from
the
mistakes
of
themselves
and
others.
People
also
learn
from
the
exchange
of
ideas
and
the
inevitable
discussion
about
how
to
write
better
and
how
to
improve
individual
writing
techniques,
etc.
That
is
yet
another
lesson
that
I
learned
in
my
VAST
class.
Group
work
was
a
fundamental
tenet
of
the
course.
Each
group
4-6
students
was
required
to
complete
PowerPoint
presentations
and
write
papers;
papers
that
were
written
in
sections
by
individual
members
and
afterwards
"cut
and
pasted"
together
were
deemed
unacceptable.
It
was
extremely
difficult
to
write
a
cohesive
paper
with
five
other
people.
The
biggest
problem
with
writing
a
group
paper
with
6
people
was
the
fact
that
each
member
of
the
group
possessed
an
individual
style
that
appeared
to
clash
with
other
members
of
the
group.
Even
more
basic
than
the
problem
of
style
was
the
difficulty
that
we
had
getting
six
people
to
agree
on
a
thesis
statement,
or
to
agree
on
the
structure
of
the
paper.
The
group
paper
was
immensely
useful,
however,
because
it
forced
us
to
reexamine
our
individual
writing
process
at
the
most
basic
level.
In
forcing
us
to
observe
how
each
would
have
individually
written
the
paper,
we
learned
to
take
what
seemed
best
from
each
person
in
order
to
produce
the
best
paper
that
the
sex
of
us
envisioned
ourselves
capable
of
producing.
We
were
also
able
to
highlight
weaknesses
in
the
writing
processes
of
our
peers.
In
instances
where
the
structure
of
the
flaw
was
not
necessarily
detrimental,
we
were
able
to
suggest
ways
that
that
student
could
improve
their
writing.
For
example,
some
of
my
peers
wrote
the
paper
and
then
write
the
thesis.
I
did
not
approve
of
that
particular
process;
in
my
mind
it
seemed
as
if
the
paper
was
written
and
then
the
writer
chose
to
look
for
a
common
thread
of
thought
that
was
then
renamed
"the
thesis."
I,
on
the
other
hand,
tended
to
write
the
thesis
first.
After
choosing
a
thesis,
I
would
write
my
paper
based
on
that
statement.
Another
lesson
learned
was
that
the
'fatal
flaw'
of
each
strategy
was
obvious
to
the
observer,
but
not
to
the
writer.
To
my
peers
who
'discovered'
a
thesis
from
the
paper,
the
paper
at
times
appeared
disorganized
and
confusing
to
the
reader.
Conversely,
paper
written
with
the
thesis
statement
first
sometimes
appeared
to
be
disjointed
in
the
attempt
to
relate
each
paragraph
to
the
thesis;
the
paper,
at
times,
may
have
also
offered
weak
support
towards
the
thesis
because
arguments
that
could
have
weakened
the
central
argument
were
minimally
addressed,
if
addressed
at
all.
From
these
two
contrasting
styles,
I
learned
that
there
is
rarely
a
completely
"wrong"
writing
process.
Even
those
students
who
chose
to
write
one
draft
and
then
used
it
as
the
final
copy
learned
something
about
their
process.
Those
types
of
students
excelled
in
brainstorming
projects
because
the
majority
of
their
initial
ideas
were
addressed
in
the
paper.
However,
to
take
their
writing
process
to
completion,
those
types
of
writers
could
have
attempted
to
write
another
draft.
Papers
written
in
such
a
haphazard
fashion
seemed
not
only
disorganized,
but
unfocused
as
well.
Above
all,
the
WA
experience
over
the
past
year
has
taught
me
that
the
exchange
of
ideas
is
important
to
the
educational
process
because
the
people
who
never
learn
are
the
people
who
insist
that
they
are
always
right
and
the
people
who
believe
that
they
have
already
learned
everything.
In
that
regard,
being
a
writing
associate
forces
me
to
participate
in
the
best
of
both
worlds:
writing
like
a
writer
and
thinking
like
a
writer
