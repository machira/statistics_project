Professor
Christian
Tatu
English
author
and
poet
Vita
Sackville-West
once
said,
NIt
is
necessary
to
write,
if
the
days
are
not
to
slip
emptily
by.
How
else,
indeed,
to
clap
the
net
over
the
butterfly
of
the
moment?
For
the
moment
passes,
it
is
forgotten;
the
mood
is
gone;
life
itself
is
gone.
That
is
where
the
writer
scores
over
his
fellows:
he
catches
the
changes
of
his
mind
on
the
hopO
(quotegarden.com).
Over
the
course
of
my
15
or
so
years
as
a
writer,
student,
and
literary
enthusiast,
I
have
watched
my
writing
develop,
evolve,
falter,
and
thrive.
Like
a
living
thing,
it
has
grown,
explored,
expanded,
and
gone
through
various
stages.
This
is
because
my
writing
is
an
extension
of
me
D
my
experiences,
triumphs,
biases,
failures
D
all
affecting
the
way
in
which
I
view
the
world,
whether
through
a
psychology
research
explication,
an
international
law
research
paper
on
whaling
practices,
or
a
blog
describing
adventures
abroad.
Though
my
techniques,
tools,
settings,
and
instruments
changed
along
with
my
own
physical,
emotional,
and
psychological
changes,
the
core
of
my
being
D
the
person
I
am
and
will
be
D
has
shown
through
as
a
constant
in
my
writing.
Although
I
study
history,
studying
oneOs
own
history,
I
have
come
to
find
through
this
project,
requires
quite
different
technique.
There
are
no
textbooks
on
my
life
to
read,
no
films
commemorating
the
NThe
21
Years
of
Ingrid:
A
HistoryO
to
watch.
This
project
required
me
to
be
resourceful
D
to
reach
into
the
depths
of
my
earliest
memories,
playing
tug
of
war
with
my
mind
to
retrieve
them.
At
best,
my
memories
of
my
early
writing
are
fragmented,
disordered
flashes.
However,
I
remember
learning
to
read
vividly.
My
mother
purchased
me
Hooked
on
Phonics,
and
I
distinctly
remember
singing
the
alphabet
along
with
the
tape,
OA
D
apple
D
ah,O
with
unprompted
dedication.
But
learning
to
write
is
not
imprinted
in
my
mind,
maybe
because
there
was
no
OHooked
on
WritingO
to
spur
my
excitement.
I
remember
learning
to
write
the
alphabet
in
kindergarten,
which
was
something
I
completed
with
utmost
seriousness
D
a
characteristic
of
myself
remaining
constant
throughout
my
life.
We
practiced
our
letters
on
lined
paper.
There
were
two
bold
lines
indicating
the
top
and
bottom
with
a
dotted
line
in
the
middle.
I
tried
with
the
best
of
my
five-year-old
fingers
to
keep
the
pencil
inside
those
bold,
blue
lines.
It
was
important
to
be
neat,
according
to
my
teacher,
Mrs.
Jankowski,
and
so,
I
was
neat.
This
was
my
earliest
writing
memory.
Helen
Keller
was
the
subject
of
my
first
book
report.
Our
assignment
was
to
read
a
biography
about
someone
and
then
to
create
a
diorama
about
their
life,
writing
down
important
details
and
illustrating
them
with
pictures.
Mrs.
Burrows,
my
first-grade
teacher,
assigned
this
project
to
only
a
small,
select
group
from
our
class
because
the
biographies
were
longer
and
more
difficult
to
read
than
most
of
the
books
the
other
first-graders
in
our
class
were
reading.
We
were
NadvancedO
readers,
which
dictated
an
advanced
assignment.
Like
writing
the
alphabet,
I
approached
this
project
seriously.
I
made
it
my
goal
to
learn
as
much
as
I
could
about
Helen
Keller
by
reading
all
the
biographies
about
her
in
the
school
library.
I
became
fascinated
with
this
blind
and
deaf
woman
who,
despite
her
disabilities,
lived
a
life
full
of
accomplishments.
Using
my
book
report
as
a
medium,
I
expressed
my
amazement
with
her
perseverance
despite
took
her
frustration
and
anger
at
living
in
a
constant
dark,
quiet
world.
Although
I
could
not
find
it,
Helen
KellerOs
life
on
diorama
is
one
of
the
only
remaining
book
reports
lying
somewhere
around
my
house.
Besides
that
one
specific
memory,
the
rest
of
my
elementary
years
are
a
blur
of
book
reports
and
essays,
but
I
remember
one
of
my
favorite
activities
in
elementary
school
was
playing
teacher,
teaching
my
class
the
alphabet
and
reading
to
imaginary
pupils.
My
parents
bought
me
a
chalkboard
to
enable
this
pastime,
and
I
spent
hours
utilizing
its
black
surface,
creating
faux
lesson
plans
with
my
white,
screechy
chalk
and
knowing
without
doubt
I
would
grow
up
to
be
a
teacher.
Since
then,
I
have
changed
my
mind.
I
also
made
various
attempts
at
keeping
diaries
and
journals,
but
nothing
substantial
evolved
from
these
futile
efforts.
A
few
of
them
are
still
in
my
bookcase,
growing
dusty
and
containing
names
of
my
crushes
or
frustrations
with
my
family
or
adventures
of
only
two
days
of
a
weeklong
vacation.
Although
I
liked
the
idea
of
recording
my
everyday
experiences,
I
grew
weary
of
recording
every
thought
(because
my
serious
side
thought
a
short
summary
of
my
day
or
weekly
entry
would
be
unacceptable)
and
impatient
with
the
fact
that
my
life
was
not
nearly
as
exciting
as
the
boxcar
children
or
Nancy
Drew
and
her
many
mysteries.
I
preferred
to
read
about
these
stories
than
write
my
own.
Looking
back,
I
wish
I
had
kept
a
more
thorough
diary
of
my
childhood
to
be
able
to
catch
glimpses
of
my
now
self
in
my
past
self
and
how
those
NmajorO
problems
I
had
were
really
minor
childhood
foibles.
Lazy
summers
reading
Nancy
Drew
and
easy
school
years
learning
cursive
faded
into
the
awkward,
harsh
middle
school
years.
I
remember
little
about
my
writing
during
this
time
except
that
I
did
well
in
ELA
class
and
all
other
subjects,
and
I
despised
myself
for
the
intelligence
that
caused
bullies
to
target
me.
My
teachers
praised
my
work;
my
peers
bullied
me
for
it.
I
grew
out
of
this
awkward
stage
and
learned
to
reconcile
being
smart
and
proud
of
it,
and
thankfully
the
other
kids
grew
out
of
being
mean,
but
it
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
I
thought
maybe
doing
well
in
school
wasnOt
the
objective
I
should
work
hardest
to
achieve
D
maybe
being
smart
wasnOt
a
good
thing.
My
determination
shaken
but
not
broken,
I
entered
high
school
and
began
a
string
of
honors
classes.
Finally,
classes
contained
students
that
wanted
to
learn
and
were
at
the
same
intelligence
level,
so
I
no
longer
stood
out.
I
felt
proud
to
be
smart
and
a
hard
worker.
English
became
one
of
my
favorite
and
best
subjects.
In
ninth
grade,
we
learned
the
infamous
five-paragraph
essay,
and
for
a
long
time,
I
thought
that
was
the
only
way
to
write
a
paper.
Thankfully,
AP
English
senior
year
whipped
me
out
of
this
stupor
and
opened
my
eyes
to
a
new
kind
of
writing
and
literature.
We
read
Shakespeare,
Bronte,
Greek
myths,
Poe,
and
I
realized
writing
could
be
so
much
more
than
a
five-paragraph
essay.
I
pushed
myself
in
AP
English,
took
it
seriously,
and
achieved
a
5
on
the
exam.
During
my
two
final
years
of
high
school,
I
also
had
various
writing
assignments
that
were
non-class
related.
I
ran
for
senior
class
president,
which
required
a
speech
to
be
given
in
front
of
all
250
of
my
classmates.
Not
one
to
get
flustered
in
front
of
a
crowd
thanks
to
my
love
of
musical
theater
performance,
I
did
not
anticipate
the
anxiety
with
which
I
would
be
filled
when
looking
into
the
eyes
of
my
peers
instead
of
a
dark
audience
and
reading
from
my
own
speech
instead
of
reciting
well-written
and
well-rehearsed
lines.
Nevertheless,
I
had
prepared
myself
well,
writing
a
speech
that
encompassed
my
qualities
without
sounding
too
boastful,
my
hopes
without
making
empty
promises,
and
my
visions
without
looking
too
far
into
the
future.
I
entered
the
race
with
my
ever-present
serious
mindset,
lasted
through
three
run-off
elections,
and
won.
In
addition
to
this
important
speech,
I
had
to
write
an
important
essay,
one
that
many
other
high
school
students
were
writing
as
well
D
the
dreaded
college
admissions
essay.
The
summer
before
senior
year,
I
pondered
about
what
to
write
D
an
unusual
accomplishment,
a
significant
event,
or
a
quirky
characteristic?
I
found
myself
falling
into
my
elementary-age
trap
D
nothing
about
which
I
thought
to
write
seemed
important
enough.
Reading
through
example
essays
in
a
variety
of
books,
I
compared
myself
to
these
phantom
authors,
these
older
and
wiser
college
students,
who
wrote
intriguing,
unique,
important
essays
and
found
myself
wondering
how
I
could
ever
write
an
essay
impressive
enough
to
grant
me
admission
to
a
college
of
my
choice.
This
time
around,
I
could
not
continue
to
read
the
college
essays
of
others
instead
of
writing
my
own
essay
like
I
had
with
the
Nancy
Drew
books
instead
of
writing
my
own
story.
I
had
to
find
the
courage
to
discover
something
I
did
not
yet
know
was
incredible
about
myself
and
write
an
eloquent,
succinct
essay.
Finally,
I
chose
to
write
about
my
trip
to
Iceland
as
an
eight-year
old
with
my
grandparents
and
how
it
changed
my
world
outlook.
It
was
a
unique
experience
that
changed
my
life
in
ways
I
could
not
understand
at
eight-years-old.
I
wrote
and
revised
more
times
than
I
could
count.
My
parents,
my
sisters,
my
friends,
and
my
AP
English
teacher,
Mr.
Mackay,
read
it
over.
It
had
to
be
perfect.
I
took
getting
into
college
with
a
seriousness
that
surprised
even
myself.
Like
most
other
endeavors
I
took
seriously,
my
relentlessness
paid
off,
and
I
was
granted
admission
to
all
but
one
of
the
institutions
to
which
I
applied.
Needless
to
say,
I
chose
Lafayette.
Here,
I
encountered
many
firsts:
my
first
time
away
from
my
family
for
more
than
a
week,
my
first
roommate
other
than
my
sister,
my
first
experience
with
college
food,
and
my
first
B.
The
B
was
harder
to
deal
with
than
any
of
the
other
firsts.
I
expected
to
have
to
work
harder
in
college,
there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind
about
that,
but
I
was
not
prepared
for
the
amount
of
required
writing.
Freshman
year,
it
felt
as
if
there
was
a
paper
due
every
week.
I
adjusted
well,
learning
that
indeed,
the
five-paragraph
essay
was
a
thing
of
the
past
and
the
five
to
ten
page
papers
became
the
norm.
I
did
not
feel
as
if
the
work
was
out
my
grasp.
Writing,
in
most
forms,
came
easy
for
me.
Bs
were
no
longer
unacceptable,
but
rather
an
impetus
to
achieve
and
understand
so
that
on
the
next
papers
I
did
well.
Widely
available
professors,
writing
associates,
and
peers
helped
hone
my
writing
skills,
and
with
so
much
assistance,
there
was
little
reason
to
fail.
My
serious
streak
continued
with
regard
to
my
schoolwork
and
writing,
manifesting
in
a
good
GPA
and
praise
from
professors.
It
was
not
until
my
semester
abroad
junior
year
that
I
realized
just
how
important
being
serious
was
to
my
writing.
In
Denmark,
I
took
an
international
law
class
with
a
professor
whose
distinguished
law
career
landed
him
a
job
working
in
the
International
Criminal
Court.
Martin
was
the
hardest
professor
with
whom
I
have
ever
worked.
He
demanded
perfection
and
attention
to
a
degree
I
had
yet
to
experience
at
Lafayette.
I
should
have
seen
this
and
adjusted
my
own
expectations
for
my
work.
But
I
was
abroad,
and
I
told
myself
schoolwork
was
of
second
priority
to
cultural
experiences.
That
backfired
D
badly.
I
received
a
C-
on
my
first
paper.
Ouch.
Never
before
had
I
done
so
poorly
on
a
writing
assignment.
The
paper
was
a
seven-page
assignment
on
the
international
laws
regarding
whaling.
I
thought
I
did
my
research
well
and
understood
the
topic,
but
in
my
lackadaisical
study
abroad
state,
my
seriousness
faltered
and
so
did
my
writing.
I
failed
to
adjust
to
the
expectations
of
not
only
Martin,
but
also
of
law
writing.
It
was
different
than
anything
I
had
written
before.
It
required
precision,
not
embellishment,
extreme
support,
not
mediocre
examples,
and
an
incredible
amount
of
knowledge
on
the
topic,
not
a
few
hours
of
research.
Once
I
realized
these
important
details,
I
improved
my
law
writing
by
dedicating
more
time
and
seriousness
to
perfecting
my
papers,
and
I
achieved
an
A
on
the
next
one.
This
A
meant
more
to
me
than
any
other
before
D
MartinOs
A
was
special
and
scarce
D
and
I
had
earned
every
ounce
of
it.
Besides
academic
writing
while
abroad,
I
also
kept
a
blog
to
record
my
memories
and
experiences
from
Denmark
and
nine
of
the
other
countries
to
which
I
traveled
over
the
course
of
four
fast,
fabulous
months.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
felt
confident
enough
with
myself
to
not
only
keep
and
stick
with
a
journal,
but
to
share
it
with
the
world.
Mind
you,
my
NworldO
was
relatively
small
in
comparison
to
the
world
of
well-known
blogs,
but
ingymarie.wordpress.com
still
managed
to
reach
almost
1,600
hits.
It
took
some
courage
to
keep
a
journal
for
others
to
see.
I
was
not
simply
writing
for
my
own
personal
pleasure;
I
had
to
write
with
a
broad
audience
in
mind.
My
friends,
relatives,
family,
and
family
friends
had
access
to
the
website.
My
father
took
the
liberty
of
giving
my
website
address
to
anyone
and
everyone
he
knew
and
I
posted
the
link
on
my
facebook
page.
Between
Dad
and
my
efforts,
people
from
Iceland,
France,
Canada,
Germany,
America,
and
Denmark
all
took
the
time
to
read
my
entries.
There
were
some
experiences
I
had
to
leave
out
knowing
my
family
would
be
reading,
and
there
were
other
anecdotes
and
descriptive
phrases
I
added
so
that
my
audience
would
enjoy
reading.
I
loved
when
people
told
me
they
loved
reading
my
writing.
One
French
friend
in
particular
who
was
working
on
his
English
kept
up
with
my
entries
and
told
me
I
was
an
excellent,
funny
writer
who
made
learning
English
easy
and
enjoyable
D
a
wonderful
compliment.
At
the
end
of
my
abroad
journey,
I
wrote
an
entry
that
so
touched
my
mom
and
reflected
her
similar
feelings
at
the
end
of
her
time
abroad
she
called
crying
on
the
phone
telling
me
she
could
understand
exactly
what
I
was
going
through
from
my
writing
that
put
her
on
a
memory
journey
back
30
years.
The
sense
that
my
writing
had
elicited
such
emotion
in
my
mom
was
the
ultimate
compliment,
and
something
only
the
two
of
us
could
share.
The
blog
was
something
I
had
never
done.
It
took
me
out
of
my
writing
comfort
zone
and
pushed
me
to
expand
my
experiences.
This
is
the
point
of
writing
D
to
push
oneself
farther
than
they
thought
possible,
to
let
others
in
to
oneOs
mind,
to
remember
life.
NFor
the
moment
passes,
it
is
forgotten.O
