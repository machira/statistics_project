"Your
grade
for
this
course
will
be
based
solely
on
a
three-thousand
word
project."
The
words
of
my
Shakespeare
professor
immediately
caused
worry.
Not
only
was
I
nervous
about
my
first
class
as
a
student
studying
abroad
in
London,
but
I
also
had
never
before
had
an
English
class
in
which
my
final
grade
was
determined
by
one
paper.
After
two-and-a-
half
years
of
college
writing,
and
a
being
a
Writing
Associate
for
over
half
of
this
time,
I
had
become
confident
in
my
writing
style
and
abilities.
However,
it
soon
became
obvious
that
to
successfully
write
for
the
expectations
of
British
professors
my
writing
was
going
to
have
to
adapt
drastically--a
process
that
proved
to
be
as
challenging
an
experience
as
adjusting
to
college
writing
as
a
freshman.
The
first,
and
the
only
easy
difference
to
overcome
was
converting
the
task
of
a
calling
a
'three-thousand
word
project'
to
the
more
familiar
assignment
of
a
'ten
to
twelve
page
paper.'
The
majority
of
British
professors
were
not
anxious
to
help
the
American
students
adjust
to
writing
for
a
British
university.
Thus,
as
a
group,
we
students
decided
to
work
together
to
determine
exactly
what
the
professors
expected
from
our
writing.
Several
students,
myself
included,
approached
professors
after
classes
and
asked
questions.
We
then
would
share
the
professors'
responses
to
slowly
learn
more
about
writing
successfully
for
a
British
university.
I
realized
that
if
I
wanted
to
write
an
appropriate
paper
I
would
have
to
adjust
not
only
the
style
of
my
writing
but
also
the
structure
of
essays
with
which
I
had
become
comfortable.
First,
the
professors
placed
high
importance
on
the
titles
of
the
papers,
which
were
to
be
relevant
to,
if
not
the
same
as,
the
papers'
theses.
Often,
the
theses
were
required
to
be
in
question
form.
For
example,
for
my
paper
analyzing
the
target
audience
of
the
company
I
interned
at,
Virago
Press,
my
title
and
thesis
was
"Who
is
Virago's
virago?"
I
would
have
possibly
still
used
this
question
for
a
title
for
a
paper
at
Lafayette,
but
for
my
theses
I
would
never
have
used
a
question.
Instead
of
a
very
concise
question,
my
thesis
would
have
been
about
the
intended
audience
that
Virago
publishes
for
and
whether
the
publications
are
suitable
and
reach
this
audience.
Being
forced
to
put
the
thesis
in
question
form
made
me
realize
that
at
times
I
probably
over-complicated
my
theses.
I
always
aimed
to
include
the
topic,
my
argument,
and
the
main
supporting
ideas
of
this
argument
in
my
thesis.
Often
my
theses
would
be
several
sentences
long
and
divided
by
semi-colons.
Being
required
to
have
a
question
made
me
focus
more
on
capturing
reader
interest
about
what
my
paper
was
about
with
a
"snappy"
thesis.
I
had
to
think
in
depth
of
a
short
statement
that
best
described
my
paper's
primary
focus.
Being
forced
to
use
a
different
format
made
me
realize
that
my
theses,
in
the
future,
need
not
be
so
lengthy
or
so
rigid
in
structure;
a
short
yet
direct
question
or
statement
may
be
as
or
even
more
effective
than
lengthy
summarizing
sentences.
In
addition
to
re-defming
my
ideas
on
effective
theses,
the
content
of
the
papers
were
expected
to
be
personal
responses
rather
than
a
removed
discussion
in
the
third
person.
The
British
professors
encouraged
using
first-person
responses
that
were
based
on
beliefs,
opinions,
and
experiences.
They
genuinely
wanted
to
know
students'
opinions
about
the
papers'
subjects
instead
of
reading
a
reverberation
of
class
discussions.
Furthermore,
the
assignments
were
completely
open;
to
make
the
papers
reflections
of
students'
ideas,
topics
were
up
to
the
students'
choice.
Rather
than
an
exposition
of
a
class
discussion
or
a
discussion
of
the
professors'
ideas,
the
papers
were
expected
to
be
students'
perspectives
and
thoughts.
Instead
of
focusing
on
the
introduction,
body,
and
conclusion
format,
the
professors
were
less
concerned
about
structure
and
more
concerned
with
our
ideas.
They
recommended
thoroughly
developing
one
idea
and
building
upon
this
idea
rather
than
stringing
together
several
supporting
ideas
to
make
an
argument,
as
I
was
used
to
doing.
Writing
became
more
inquisitive;
we
were
encouraged
to
ask
a
question
outright
then
support,
and
also
refute,
ideas.
The
encouragement
to
be
less
focused
on
the
format
of
the
paper
in
favor
of
discussing
personal
opinions
gave
me
the
freedom
to
write
less
academically,
as
I
was
accustomed
to
producing
research-like
papers.
Also,
I
was
not
used
to
writing
in
the
first
person
unless
a
paper
was
specifically
intended
to
be
a
personal
response.
I
realized
that
I
could
still
write
a
paper
on
an
academic
argument
like
the
problematic
view
of
women
in
Shakespeare's
comedies,
and
yet
I
was
also
able
to
include
personal
opinions
about
how
the
characters
would
have
acted
if
they
were
not
fictional
creations
of
a
male
author.
Although
I
had
formed
a
greater
grasp
on
the
professors'
requirements
and
suggestions,
adjusting
my
writing
was
difficult.
The
paper
took
much
longer
to
write
than
a
usual
paper
for
Lafayette.
Since
I
had
been
accustomed
with
my
structure,
instead
of
focusing
mainly
on
my
thesis
argument
and
content,
I
now
had
to
be
concerned
with
every
aspect
of
my
writing.
The
confusion
about
the
professors'
expectations
and
a
paper
structure
that
I
was
not
accustomed
to
reminded
me
of
the
adjustment
from
high
school
to
college
writing
that
I
faced
three
years
ago.
Unfortunately,
at
the
British
university
there
were
no
students
or
group
to
help
with
my
confusion,
answer
questions,
make
suggestions,
and
critique
my
paper
like
the
WA
program
at
Lafayette.
This
lack
of
support
and
help
reminded
me
to
freshman
year
when
the
WA
program
was
invaluable
with
helping
me
adjust
to
college
writing.
After
freshman
year,
however,
some
upperclassmen
seem
to
take
the
program
for
granted.
Often,
I
hear
students
say
that
meeting
with
WA's
is
only
for
freshman
or
"I'm
a
senior,
I
know
how
to
write
by
now."
One
of
my
good
friends
even
did
not
consider
it
insulting
when
she
said,
"Well,
no
one
really
cares
about
meeting
with
their
WA."
Furthermore,
as
a
WA,
I'm
frequently
asked,
"Isn't
it
annoying
having
to
meet
with
a
WA
since
you
are
one?"
I
always
answer
these
questions
by
saying
that
even
as
a
more
experienced
writer,
one
can
never
get
enough
feedback
on
writing.
I
think
being
a
WA
and
meeting
with
another
WA
is
a
great
chance
to
get
additional
commentary
on
my
papers,
but
also
to
see
how
other
WAs
hold
conferences
and
possibly
use
some
of
their
techniques.
My
experiences
in
London
only
made
me
value
greater
the
availability,
support,
and
advice
that
the
WA
program
offers
all
writers.
The
other
students'
and
my
concern
about
writing
for
British
professors
caused
us
to
join
together
and
discuss
our
writing.
We
shared
ideas,
read
each
other's
papers,
and
offered
suggestions
about
how
to
improve
our
papers.
The
experience
of
having
to
adapt
to
different
expectations
of
writing
"rehumbled"
my
confidence
in
my
writing.
I
had
left
Lafayette
as
a
confident
writer
but
soon
that
confidence
turned
into
confusion,
and
I
doubted
my
ability
to
adapt.
However,
perhaps
this
necessary
adjustment
of
my
writing
happened
at
an
ideal
time.
After
writing
for
professors'
expectations
at
Lafayette
for
two
years,
I
found
myself
adhering
to
a
similar
style
of
writing
for
each
paper.
Having
to
choose
a
topic
independently
was
stressful;
I
preferred
when
a
professor
would
either
require
a
paper
to
be
on
a
specific
topic
or
would
make
suggestions
about
a
possible
topic.
Thus,
in
London,
simply
deciding
what
I
wanted
to
write
about
forced
me
to
analyze
which
topic
I
could
most
effectively
explore,
argue,
and
have
a
personal
response
to.
I
realized
that
I
had
become
too
dependent
on
my
writing
style.
I
had
been
successful
in
writing
strong,
organized
papers
but
my
writing
identity,
I
see
now,
had
become
standard.
Perhaps,
however,
my
writing
had
become
standard
because
my
classes
required
that
I
do
a
lot
of
writing
and
responses.
During
Lafayette's
first
semester
last
year
I
had
a
demanding
writing
schedule.
Taking
three
300-level
English
courses,
I
was
constantly
turning
in
writing.
Because
of
this
high
demand
to
turn
in
journals
and
papers,
my
writing
became
formulaic.
Since
I
had
to
turn
in
journals
three
times
a
week
for
two
of
these
classes,
I
became
less
aware
that
my
responses
were
very
similar
in
format
because
I
concentrated
on
responding
to
the
content
that
I
was
supposed
to
include.
For
several
larger
papers
that
I
was
required
to
write,
I
was
also
guilty
of
using
similar
structures.
The
journals
and
papers
were
successful,
but
having
to
adapt
my
writing
while
abroad
made
me
re-evaluate
my
writing
process
and
determine
that
I
was
not
challenging
my
writing
ability
as
I
used
to.
While
I
was
not
most
comfortable
with
the
preferences
of
the
British
professors,
I
learned
that
I
can
adapt
to
different
styles
and
that
I
should
be
more
variable
in
my
approaches
to
writing.
My
experiences
as
a
WA
that
semester
were
also
a
bit
challenging.
Looking
back
I
think
I
also
became
routine
in
the
advice
and
suggestions
that
I
would
offer
students.
I
remember
during
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
that
I
often
tried
to
take
unconventional
approaches
to
my
meetings.
For
example,
when
a
student's
points
were
out
of
order,
we
grabbed
a
pair
of
scissors
to
cut
and
re-arrange
his
body
paragraphs
so
that
his
argument
was
logically
organized.
I
would
love
if
each
of
my
conferences
could
be
as
innovative
and
successful
as
this
conference.
The
more
interesting
a
conference
is,
the
more
interested
the
student
is
in
his
or
her
writing.
The
student's
whose
paper
was
cut
and
pasted
ended
up
seeing
me
two
more
times
for
the
same
paper
until
he
was
confident
in
his
response
to
the
assignment.
The
energy
and
interest
of
this
student
in
writing
was
very
refreshing.
After
some
thought,
however,
I
think
my
conferences
as
a
WA
for
a
freshman
seminar
had
more
of
this
energy
and
interest
because
the
students
were
freshman,
unsure
about
the
expectations
of
college
writing
and
concerned
about
their
papers.
Unfortunately,
my
experiences
as
a
WA
for
an
upperclassmen
VAST
course
has
lead
me
to
believe
that
unless
a
student
is
genuinely
concerned
with
his
or
her
writing
in
general
or
has
specific
questions
about
a
paper,
then
students
tend
to
see
a
WA
visit
as
a
chore.
I
often
encountered
the
"upperclassman
syndrome"
of
the
majority
of
students
that
feel
like
only
freshman
need
advice
with
writing.
I
think
that
if
one
does
not
analyze
his
or
her
writing
experiences,
as
this
paper
is
asking
me
to,
that
people
are
not
overly
aware
of
their
writing
identity.
Most
people
do
not
know
whether
they
have
a
typical
format
or
style,
how
their
writing
has
evolved
or
changed,
or
how
they
adapt
to
write
for
different
subjects.
Most
focus
on
things
like
an
overactive
tendency
to
add
commas,
titles,
or
not
being
overly
interested
in
the
assigned
topic.
Students
tend
not
to
think
of
writing
a
paper
as
a
process
in
which
several
parts
form
a
whole;
often,
writing
is
seen
more
as
a
due
date.
My
experiences
as
a
student
in
London
this
year
and
also
as
a
WA
have
greatly
challenged
my
writing.
Just
when
I
had
become
comfortable
with
my
writing
style,
and
although
the
process
was
tedious,
I
found
that
it
is
rewarding
to
re-define
my
own
"rules"
of
writing.
I
have
realized
that
writing
is
a
constant
evolution
and
it
is
best
to
not
get
too
settled
into
one
style
or
format
because
many
approaches
to
writing
can
be
equally
as
successful.
