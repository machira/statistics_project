Writing
Narrative
As
the
twentieth
century
progressed,
members
of
the
academic
world
realized
that
if
the
leaders
of
tomorrow
were
to
be
effective,
the
children
of
today
had
to
be
able
to
communicate.
The
fundamental
basis
of
communication
is
the
written
word.
If
a
person
possesses
the
ability
to
write
a
detailed
description
of
an
idea,
that
person
can
then
communicate
it
to
the
entire
world.
That
is
why
throughout
my
education,
teachers
have
emphasized
the
importance
of
good
writing.
My
vast
experiences
of
triumphs
and
failures
have
led
me
to
a
path
I
never
would
have
thought
I
would
be
on,
poised
to
become
a
Writing
Associate.
Odd
as
it
may
sound,
my
first
writing
experience
came
as
a
four
year-old.
Though
most
people
would
say
that
no
four
year-old
could
write,
at
that
point
in
my
life
I
learned
a
very
important
skill.
It
was
then
that
I
learned
to
write
the
alphabet.
Most
people
forget
that
you
cannot
have
words
without
letters
and
if
you
don't
learn
how
to
form
them
properly,
your
message
will
never
get
through
to
another
person.
I
remember
being
excited
when
I
realized
that
all
the
words
to
my
favorite
books
were
not
out
of
my
reach.
I
too
could
one
day
write
a
Dr.
Seuss
book
or
anything
else
my
parents
had
given
me
to
read.
That
was
my
fist
big
step
in
learning
to
write.
My
next
clear
memory
of
writing
was
in
first
grade.
We
all
received
these
red
phonics
workbooks.
They
were
to
be
our
guides
in
learning
to
write
the
words
that
we
could
already
say.
That
was
the
first
time
I
noticed
how
difficult
the
English
language
was
and
what
it
would
mean
to
master
it.
The
words
that
I
thought
were
so
simple
to
say
I
soon
learned
would
not
be
so
easy
to
write.
I
had
to
work
hard
to
learn
how
to
get
even
the
most
straightforward
sentence
like
"I
love
you,"
on
paper.
From
then
on,
I
knew
that
writing
would
not
be
a
walk
in
the
park.
In
third
grade
as
part
of
the
new
writing
curriculum,
students
were
required
to
spend
15
minutes
at
a
computer
every
day
to
learn
how
to
type
properly.
I
remember
having
trouble
because
the
letters
were
not
in
order
and
once
again
I
could
not
create
the
most
basic
words.
Over
time
though
I
soon
mastered
the
ability
to
type
on
the
computer
and
found
a
whole
new
medium
for
my
writing.
This
tool
became
useful
in
fourth
grade.
My
teacher,
Mrs.
Paino
decided
to
put
our
newfound
skills
to
use.
Each
of
our
stories
that
we
wrote
for
her
in
our
marble
composition
book
had
to
be
typed
up
on
the
computer
and
then
a
printed
copy
placed
in
the
book
alongside
the
original.
This
meant
that
at
least
once
a
week
I
would
be
sitting
in
front
of
a
computer
typing
up
my
stories
trying
to
understand
why
our
hand-written
copy
was
not
good
enough
for
Mrs.
Paino.
I
had
good
handwriting.
I
didn't
think
there
should
be
any
problem
with
her
simply
reading
my
stories
out
of
my
composition
book.
So
I
asked
Mrs.
Paino
why
she
did
not
want
to
read
our
stories
anymore
as
written.
She
told
me
that
even
though
I
wrote
well,
other
people
write
sloppily.
It
was
nearly
impossible
for
her
to
understand
why
they
had
written.
She
explained
that
she
didn't
want
to
give
a
good
story
a
bad
grade
simply
because
the
person
had
poor
handwriting.
She
felt
it
was
n
unfair
punishment.
The
computer
allowed
everyone's
stories
to
be
clear
and
legible.
Ideas
cannot
be
shared
if
they
cannot
be
read.
The
computer
would
from
then
on
be
an
important
tool
in
my
writing
career.
Fifth
grade
was
a
crucial
year
for
me.
New
York
Ste
required
that
every
fifth
grader
be
subjected
to
a
writing
exam.
The
format
was
two
essays,
which
were
to
be
read
by
two
teachers
on
a
scale
of
one
to
hour
for
a
total
possible
score
of
sixteen.
Therefore,
Mrs.
Wall
decided
that
all
our
essays
would
be
graded
in
a
similar
fashion
that
year
to
prepare
us
for
the
test.
For
the
first
month
and
a
half
of
the
school
year
I
consistently
got
threes
on
my
essays.
Most
people
on
my
class
would
have
been
fine
with
that,
but
I
was
not
satisfied.
I
wanted
to
get
a
four
on
my
essay.
Part
of
me
wanted
it
because
I
was
always
a
good
student
and
to
not
be
able
to
achieve
perfection
was
bothering
me.
The
rest
of
me
wanted
to
know
what
exactly
was
needed
in
order
to
get
a
four
on
an
essay.
A
couple
of
other
students
in
the
class
had
gotten
fours
and
I
figured
I
was
just
as
good
of
a
writer,
why
shouldn't
I
get
a
four
as
well?
I
tried
harder
in
my
next
essay
but
achieved
the
same
result,
a
three.
Finally
I
realized
that
I
could
no
longer
try
to
do
this
on
my
own,
because
obviously
I
was
unable
to
do
what
I
had
to
do
to
achieve
my
goal.
I
decided
to
take
the
road
less
traveled
and
actually
talk
to
my
teacher
instead
of
just
about
complaining
about
her
grading.
Mrs.Walls
told
me
that
for
the
most
part
I
wrote
well
and
that
I
was
in
fact
a
good
writer.
My
plots
were
well
developed,
and
I
always
wrote
on
the
assigned
topic.
She
then
explained
to
me
that
just
because
a
story
is
good
and
has
a
good
plot
it
doesn't
always
deserve
a
perfect
score.
She
said
tha
tl
was
not
writing
at
the
same
level
that
I
spoke.
Though
briefly
baffled,
I
asked
her
to
continue.
She
explained
that
when
I
spoke
I
used
certain
vocabulary
words
that
were
in
fact
above
my
grade
level
at
the
time.
However
when
I
wrote
my
essays
I
tended
to
use
the
first
words
that
came
to
my
mind
to
describe
something.
That
was
often
a
simple
word
and
would
be
repeated
throughout
the
story.
She
said
that
on
the
next
essay
assignment
I
should
write
the
story
as
I
would
normally,
but
then
at
the
end
go
through
with
a
thesaurus
and
substitute
some
of
the
words
with
more
vivid
language.
With
my
mother's
assistance,
I
followed
Mrs.
Wall's
advice
and
my
next
essay
"The
National
Spelling
Bee"
came
back
with
a
huge
four
on
he
top
of
it.
I
was
so
proud
of
myself.
To
this
day
that
phrase
"vivid
language"
has
stayed
with
me
as
a
reminder
that
language
can
make
or
break
your
writing.
Writing
is
graded
subjectively.
No
matter
how
closely
you
follow
instructions,
there
is
a
person
grading
your
paper
and
their
feeling
often
influence
the
way
that
person
grades
your
writing.
This
is
a
lesson
that
I
have
learned
the
hard
way
over
my
years
in
7th
through
12th
grade.
In
7th
grade,
my
teacher
loved
my
writing.
I
got
good
grades
on
all
of
my
assignments
and
felt
confident
that
I
had
at
last
mastered
the
art
of
writing.
Of
course
since
I
was
a
naive
twelve
year
old,
I
was
in
for
quite
a
shock
the
following
year
when
my
writing
did
not
receive
the
same
praise
from
my
new
English
teacher.
I
did
the
best
I
could
though
and
preceded
to
high
school
a
little
gun-shy
about
writing
for
my
new
teacher.
Mrs.
Seeger
however,
loved
my
writing.
She
taught
me
how
to
pay
attention
to
the
seemingly
insignificant
details
of
a
story
that
are
actually
signs
of
the
writer's
thoughts.
When
I
looked
at
my
writing
I
found
that
I
to
fell
back
on
certain
phases,
details,
and
ideas
that
were
inherently
mine.
She
showed
me
that
writing
comes
from
a
person,
and
to
understand
how
to
write
you
must
understand
yourself
first
and
let
that
show
in
your
writing.
In
tenth
grade,
I
was
jostled
again
by
my
teacher's
general
dislike
for
my
writing.
She
said
that
although
I
write
well,
she
just
never
felt
that
my
paper
were
worth
a
higher
grade.
That
along
with
a
project
the
following
year
taught
me
to
write
for
my
audience.
My
eleventh
grade
teacher
Mr.
Markowitz
was
known
as
the
best
English
teacher
in
my
high
school.
He
was
articulate
and
well
versed
in
literature.
He
favorite
book
was
The
Great
Gatsby
by
F.
Scott
Fitzgerald.
The
assignment
was
to
read
three
different
book
reviews
from
different
magazines,
then
chose
one
to
mimic
to
write
a
review
of
Gatsby.
He
told
us
to
read
one
review
from
a
popular
magazine,
one
from
a
more
sophisticated
publication,
and
finally
one
from
a
magazine
for
librarians
and
teacher.
My
eyes
were
suddenly
opened
to
the
fact
that
even
reviews
were
written
for
different
audiences.
I
was
astounded
to
find
that
depending
on
whether
the
audience
was
academic
or
not,
the
review
changed.
I
have
ever
since
made
sure
to
determine
who
my
audience
is
before
writing
so
as
to
get
a
better
idea
of
what
style
to
use
in
approaching
the
assignment.
For
the
first
time
I
was
focused
on
my
audience
as
my
main
reason
or
writing
in
a
certain
way.
I
received
an
A
for
my
efforts
and
knew
that
I
had
discovered
a
valuable
technique
that
would
become
useful
throughout
my
writing
career.
After
escaping
from
Mr.
Markowitz's
class
alive
and
a
better
writer,
I
though
I
had
finally
gotten
over
my
writing
problems.
Once
again
I
was
wrong.
As
I
started
to
write
my
college
essays
my
fear
came
rushing
back
to
me.
People
were
going
to
be
reading
my
essays.
Even
if
I
write
on
topic,
they
may
just
not
like
my
writing
and
thus
prevent
me
from
getting
into
college.
The
situation
worsened
as
a
practice
college
essay
for
my
English
teacher
came
back
repeatedly
with
bad
grades
and
lots
of
red
marks.
I
was
getting
frustrated
and
nervous
about
not
getting
into
good
school
because
of
my
writing.
As
I
though
more
and
more
about
it
I
got
more
and
more
angry
until
I
had
a
sort
of
epiphany.
I
wasn't
writing
the
right
way.
I
was
so
worried
about
writing
the
"correct"
answer
to
the
question
or
topic
that
the
essay
no
longer
contained
any
essence
of
me.
Remembering
what
Mrs.
Seeger
taught
me
I
reread
my
latest
draft
of
an
essay
and
if
I
had
not
seen
my
name
at
the
top
I
might
have
mistaken
it
for
someone
else's
writing.
Somewhere
between
the
grammar
and
punctuation
I
had
lost
myself.
I
scrapped
all
my
essays
and
stared
all
over
again
this
time
just
trying
to
write
as
myself.
Even
now
as
I
write
this
paper
I
am
reminding
myself
that
this
is
my
story,
not
anyone
else's
and
in
order
for
my
writing
to
be
effective
it
has
to
remain
a
statement
from
me.
I
didn't
know
what
to
expect
from
my
first
year
seminar.
I
thought
the
topic
of
the
class
sounded
interesting
and
that
seemed
a
sufficient
enough
reason
to
choose
a
class.
It
didn't
really
occur
to
me
that
I
would
be
writing
extensively
on
that
topic.
For
the
first
time
I
would
be
meeting
with
a
Writing
Associate,
a
cross
between
a
student
and
a
professor.
As
I
received
my
first
assignment
from
the
professor
I
had
mixed
feelings.
I
knew
that
the
research
would
be
no
problem
since
I
was
well
versed
on
the
subject.
On
the
other
hand,
I
was
anxious
as
to
how
this
Writing
Associate
as
well
as
the
professor
would
like
my
writing.
I
wrote
ym
first
draft
and
brought
it
to
my
WA
meeting
thinking
that
I
had
written
a
great
paper.
Much
to
my
relief
so
did
the
WA.
So
over
the
next
two
drafts,
I
tweaked
a
few
minor
details
and
handed
in
my
paper
to
the
professor
thinking
that
I
had
my
first
college
A
in
the
bag.
I
couldn't'
have
been
more
wrong.
When
I
received
my
ink-covered
paper
back,
I
realized
that
I
was
obviously
doing
something
very
wrong.
How
could
a
supposedly
well-written
paper
get
such
a
mediocre
grade?
Then
it
hit
me
like
a
ton
of
bricks.
Even
though
I
had
received
praise
of
my
paper
from
my
WA,
that
person
was
not
the
same
one
that
had
put
the
grade
of
my
paper.
In
the
past
my
teacher
was
the
one
to
read
over
the
draft
and
grade
the
paper
making
the
criticism
much
easier
to
take
because
if
you
followed
it,
you
were
almost
assured
a
better
grade.
With
the
WA
system,
that
was
no
longer
the
case.
Though
trained
in
aspects
of
writing,
my
WA
was
a
student
just
like
me.
And
even
thought
that
person
may
have
liked
the
paper
on
the
whole,
I
should
have
asked
what
I
could
have
done
to
strengthen
it
to
the
professor's
standards.
I
had
been
too
happy
with
the
fact
that
I
had
written
a
good
paper
that
I
didn't
concern
myself
with
writing
a
great
paper.
In
the
end
it
helped
me
to
be
more
attentive
to
my
professor's
demands
and
suggestions.
I
plan
on
continuing
to
do
this
in
the
future.
After
finishing
my
first
year
seminar,
I
figured
I
would
be
through
with
writing
for
a
while.
Soon
after,
I
received
an
interesting
piece
of
mail.
My
first
year
seminar
professor
had
nominated
me
for
a
WA
position.
As
I
read
the
letter,
I
was
amazed
to
see
that
not
only
did
my
professor
think
that
I
was
a
good
writer
after
all,
but
that
I
had
the
knowledge
an
experience
to
help
other
students.
I
had
never
thought
of
applying
for
the
position
until
that
day,
because
I
thought
that
you
had
to
be
an
expert
in
writing
to
take
the
job.
Then
I
realized
that
it
was
more
important
that
I
understood
the
process
of
writing,
the
experience
of
writing
for
a
professor,
having
successes
and
failures
that
make
a
WA
effective.
I
am
nineteen
year
old.
I
don't
pretend
to
know
everything
and
anything.
Too
many
times
in
my
life
I've
been
proven
wrong,
and
that
includes
my
writing.
Like
most
writing,
it's
not
perfect.
However,
I
have
learned
enough
to
know
what
things
in
writing
I
can
improve
and
how
I
can
share
them
with
others.
I
possess
the
ability
to
convey
my
ideas
to
other
people.
I
can
do
it
in
a
way
that
they
know
exactly
my
position
and
can
respond
to
it
accordingly.
I
think
that
is
that
most
important
tool
I've
learned
to
use
in
my
education
and
one
that
I
hope
to
be
able
to
share
with
other
students
in
the
coming
year.
