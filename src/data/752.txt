WA
Summer
Writing
Assignment
I
was
in
preschool
when
I
first
attempted
to
write
my
full
name.
I
still
have
the
crumpled
piece
of
construction
paper
taped
up
on
the
wall
in
my
room;
a
sort
of
shrine
to
the
early
stages
of
my
development.
As
one
might
expect,
it
is
completely
illegible.
The
crayon
scribble
would
be
impossible
to
understand
if
my
teacher
had
not
written
my
name
in
print
underneath.
But
to
give
my
mother
credit
for
the
unconditional
admiration
she
has
for
her
children,
every
time
she
looks
at
the
paper
taped
on
my
wall,
she
remembers
being
proud
that
I
was
able
to
make
two
straight
lines
in
my
attempt
to
form
a
NzO.
Unfortunately,
my
writing
ability
did
not
improve
much
over
the
next
few
years.
I
was
in
first
grade
when
I
realized
that
writing
was
a
skill
to
be
learned
and
not
all
writers
were
created
equal.
My
English
class
was
moving
on
to
chapter
books
and
I
was
still
stuck
on
short
stories.
My
reading
ability
had
improved
at
a
snailOs
pace
and
my
writing
ability
was
even
further
behind.
Mr.
G,
the
wonderful
man
who
thankfully
changed
my
life,
insisted
that
I
meet
with
him
twice
a
week
during
lunch
for
private
reading/writing
sessions.
At
first
the
sessions
were
a
total
drag.
I
hated
reading.
I
hated
writing.
I
wanted
to
eat
lunch
in
the
cafeteria
with
all
my
friends.
So
there
I
was,
stuck
playing
educational
board
games
with
my
teacher.
But
my
teacher,
the
genius
that
he
was,
realized
that
my
lack
of
interest
in
reading
came,
not
from
disinterest
in
school,
but
from
my
passion
for
day
dreaming.
I
was
always
somewhere
else,
enjoying
a
fantasy
world
of
my
own
creation.
The
same
day
I
told
him
I
wanted
to
be
a
Jedi
when
I
grew
up;
he
pulled
out
Harry
Potter
and
the
SorcererOs
Stone.
And
thatOs
when
my
first
grade
teacher
totally
blew
my
mind.
Our
lunch
sessions
became
the
most
exciting
part
of
my
day.
We
would
alternate
reading,
using
different
voices
to
bring
the
characters
to
life.
Mr.
G
continued
to
recommend
books,
like
The
Series
of
Unfortunate
Events,
silly
books
about
fantasy
worlds
that
he
knew
I
would
enjoy.
Once
I
had
the
reading
thing
down,
he
asked
me
to
write
responses
to
the
books
we
read.
Not
boring
summaries
but
stories
where
I
could
write
about
myself
as
a
wizard,
or
a
genius
orphan,
or
an
animal
with
a
superpower.
By
the
end
of
first
grade,
I
was
burning
through
black
ink
pens
as
I
feverishly
wrote
about
every
fantasy
world
I
could
imagine.
Five
years
later,
I
sat
happily
at
the
top
of
my
sixth
grade
English
class.
On
the
first
day
of
middle
school,
my
English
teacher
introduced
the
students
to
the
wonderful
world
of
writing
competitions.
Our
class
would
begin
every
Monday
with
15
minutes
of
creative
writing.
The
person
to
write
the
NbestO
(for
lack
of
a
better
word)
piece
would
receive
a
sticker
next
to
his/her
name
on
a
giant
pink
poster
on
the
wall.
The
eleven-year-old
version
of
me
loved
writing
and
absolutely
adored
stickers.
Seriously,
I
never
had
enough
stickers.
My
desire
to
dominate
this
competition
was
overwhelming.
One
can
imagine,
then,
my
extreme
disappointment
after
one
month
goes
by
and
I
still
have
yet
to
earn
a
sticker.
I
stayed
afterschool
one
Monday,
ready
to
attack
my
teacher
for
her
blatant
discrimination
against
me,
when
she
gave
me
a
bit
of
a
reality
check.
My
stories
were,
in
fact,
the
opposite
of
creative
writing.
I
had
simply
been
stealing
ideas
from
books
I
read
and
placing
myself
in
those
situations.
Writing
a
story
about
a
curly-haired
girl
who
loved
school
and
happened
to
be
a
wizard
was
not
exactly
revolutionary
(thanks
Hermione
Granger
for
stealing
my
alter-egoOs
identity).
My
teacher
instructed
me
to
go
beyond
the
books
IOve
read,
learning
how
to
write
from
those
authors
but
not
what
to
write
about.
Despite
the
wisdom
in
this
advice,
it
still
took
me
a
few
weeks
to
say
goodbye
to
my
fantasy
life
as
a
British
wonder-wizard.
Thinking
back
on
it
today,
I
honestly
cannot
remember
what
I
chose
to
write
about
when
I
finally
began
using
my
own
ideas
in
the
creative
writing
competition.
I
do,
however,
remember
the
many
smiling
cupcake
stickers
I
earned
for
those
ideas.
And
I
remember
the
certificate
my
teacher
handed
me
for
NMost-Improved
WriterO
on
the
last
day
of
sixth
grade.
I
continued
to
improve
as
a
writer
throughout
middle
school,
though
I
did
not
face
another
significant
challenge
as
a
writer
until
my
freshman
year
of
high
school
when
I
was
introduced
to
two
of
my
now-favorite
writing
tools,
computers
and
Peer
Editing.
My
adventure
with
computers
came
first.
During
the
summer
before
I
entered
high
school,
my
father
bought
our
first
family
computer.
I
spent
most
of
July
and
August
learning
how
to
type
like
a
pro,
but
even
as
a
junior
in
college,
I
have
yet
to
master
it.
I
basically
peck
at
the
keyboard
with
two
fingers
on
each
hand.
ItOs
not
so
bad
now
that
I
am
use
to
it
and
relatively
efficient.
But
back
then,
it
created
a
whole
new
set
of
challenges.
Suddenly
my
papers
were
drowning
in
typos
and
awkward
grammatical
situations
I
hadnOt
noticed
when
I
wrote
my
papers
by
hand.
Somehow
I
became
so
reliant
on
spell
check
that
I
would
misspell
simple
vegetable
names
on
the
grocery
list.
I
was
a
disaster.
Thankfully,
my
father
came
to
my
rescue.
Never
one
to
miss
a
teaching
opportunity,
my
father
explained
the
arduous
(and
necessary)
task
of
proof
reading
oneOs
papers.
Together,
we
developed
a
two-step
process
that
I
still
use
to
this
day.
First,
I
read
the
paper
on
the
computer.
This
step
is
intended
to
take
care
of
typos
and
glaring
spelling
errors,
especially
ones
that
spell
check
missed.
For
example,
writing
NcouchO
when
you
meant
to
write
NcoachO.
Second,
I
read
a
printed
version
of
the
essay.
This
step
is
important
for
getting
rid
of
grammatical
errors
and
more
discreet
spelling
mistakes.
There
are
two
things
necessary
for
this
step
to
work;
the
essay
must
be
read
out
loud
(often
I
donOt
see
grammar
mistakes
but
I
can
almost
always
hear
them)
and
I
always
wait
one
day
to
read
the
printed
version
(otherwise
I
am
too
familiar
with
the
essay
to
notice
mistakes).
Those
steps
are
second-nature
to
me
now.
But
back
when
I
was
fourteen,
computers
introduced
me
to
writing
as
a
process
instead
of
simply
being
a
product.
When
high
school
actually
started,
I
faced
another
new
writing
challenge;
Peer
Editing.
In
my
freshman
year
English
class,
led
by
the
fabulous
Mr.
Hudder,
the
way
I
thought
about
editing
changed
drastically.
I
will
even
credit
this
particular
exercise
for
preparing
me
for
college
writing.
Prior
to
Mr.
HudderOs
class,
I
would
read
through
my
own
essays
to
fix
grammatical
mistakes
or
awkward
phrasings.
Rarely
did
I
look
through
an
essay
specifically
for
content.
I
always
assumed
that
my
first
effort
to
write
a
paper
would
have
good
enough
content.
Honestly
I
had
never
even
thought
about
editing
content
before.
I
would
make
an
outline
of
the
main
points
I
wanted
to
incorporate
into
the
essay
and
then
fill
in
the
blanks.
But
those
original
points
rarely
changed
from
the
outline
stage
to
the
final
paper.
Luckily,
Mr.
Hudder
did
not
agree
with
my
approach
towards
editing.
It
was
the
first
essay
assignment
of
my
high
school
career
and
I
was
thrilled
with
my
paper.
I
had
exceeded
the
minimum
page
length
and
come
up
with
a
catchy
title
(I
donOt
actually
remember
the
title
but
I
remember
being
disappointed
when
Mr.
Hudder
didnOt
like
it).
When
I
went
to
hand
the
essay
in
at
the
beginning
of
class,
Mr.
Hudder
told
me
to
wait.
Then
the
whole
class
just
sat
with
our
papers
at
our
seats
until
Mr.
Hudder
let
us
in
on
the
secret.
These
papers
would
actually
be
a
rough
draft,
not
a
final
as
we
had
previously
been
told.
And
today
we
would
all
edit
each
otherOs
papers.
I
immediately
switched
papers
with
my
best
friend
Kate.
Almost
everyone
else
had
the
same
reaction.
Nobody
wanted
their
papers
read
by
another
student.
But
if
it
had
to
be
someone,
then
it
may
as
well
be
someone
who
would
not
be
overly
critical.
Mr.
Hudder,
reading
our
minds,
got
up
and
switched
the
papers
around
at
random
and
added
that
we
would
be
graded
on
our
edits.
He
also
handed
out
the
original
assignment
sheet
for
the
essay.
Beneath
it
had
specific
instructions
on
peer
editing,
which
I
did
not
bother
to
read.
After
all,
I
was
clearly
an
editing
pro.
One
of
the
few
times
I
remember
crying
about
a
grade
is
when
I
received
a
C
on
that
Peer
Editing
exercise.
I
showed
the
grade
to
my
mother,
complaining
about
how
ridiculous
the
standards
are
in
high
school
and
how
my
teacher
clearly
hated
me.
She
asked
me
simply
if
I
had
read
the
instructions.
The
instructions
explained
how
the
editor
should
focus
on
the
essay
prompt,
how
well
the
thesis
answers
it,
and
how
well
the
individual
paragraphs
support
the
thesis.
All
of
my
edits
were
about
spelling
and
grammar.
Feeling
extremely
embarrassed,
I
went
to
Mr.
Hudder
to
apologize
and
explain
how
I
had
ignored
his
instructions
because
I
was
so
sure
that
I
knew
how
to
edit.
He
began
to
explain
why
his
method
of
editing
is
important.
And,
of
course,
I
did
my
best
to
ignore
him.
I
knew
my
method
worked
in
middle
school
and
that
clearly
proved
I
was
a
good
writer.
Needless
to
say,
I
did
not
do
well
the
first
half
of
freshman
year
in
English.
Mr.
Hudder,
much
to
his
credit,
sensed
my
reluctance
to
adapt
to
his
style
and
made
it
his
goal
to
convince
me.
Whenever
I
had
a
rough
draft
written,
we
would
meet
afterschool
and
he
would
question
every
argument
and
every
conclusion
in
my
paper.
It
was
exhausting;
having
someone
surgically
cut
through
the
essay
I
had
worked
so
hard
to
write.
But
after
many
months
of
meetings,
and
a
lot
of
emotional
trauma,
I
learned
how
to
edit
effectively.
ItOs
like
that
old
clich
Nsubstance,
over
styleO.
I
learned
that
what
I
write
is
equally,
if
not
more
important,
to
how
I
write
it.
And
I
realized
that
no
outline
is
perfect;
a
good
writer
continues
to
develop
her
ideas,
even
when
sheOs
in
the
editing
stage
of
writing
a
paper.
Finally,
the
most
formative
experience
I
have
had
in
writing
has
come
from
my
participation
in
competitive
debate.
I
began
debating
when
I
was
a
freshman
in
high
school
and
I
am
currently
debating
at
Lafayette
College.
High
school
debate
brought
my
reasoning
and
writing
skills
to
a
much
higher
level
than
my
in-class
assignments.
Fundamentally,
debate
taught
me
how
to
logically
organize
the
content
of
my
paper
and
how
to
add
stronger
analysis
to
my
research
papers.
If
I
had
to
choose
one
life
experience
that
prepared
me
to
succeed
in
college,
debate
was
it.
There
are
three
significant
ways
in
which
debate
had
a
positive
impact
on
my
writing;
the
structure
of
a
case,
the
structure
of
an
argument,
and
judge
critique.
First,
the
structure
of
an
affirmative
case
must
be
logical
and
well-organized,
but
the
debater
must
decide
how
the
case
should
be
written.
This
form
of
writing
was
very
difficult
for
me
in
the
beginning.
There
was
a
framework
at
the
top
and
arguments
as
the
body
of
the
case.
The
order
within
the
framework
and
the
order
of
the
case
arguments
have
a
significant
impact
on
how
the
case
is
perceived
by
the
judge.
This
emphasis
on
structure
is
also
important
when
writing
an
essay
or
research
paper.
Technically,
one
must
convince
the
reader
that
their
thesis
is
true
and
provide
evidence
to
support
that
thesis.
In
that
way,
the
experience
I
had
writing
affirmative
cases
translated
well
to
the
requirements
of
writing
a
good
essay.
Second,
there
are
two
ways
I
have
learned
to
structure
each
individual
argument,
which
has
taught
me
how
to
effectively
write
paragraphs
in
an
essay.
A
lot
of
English
teachers
explain
how
to
write
paragraphs
using
the
sandwich
analogy
to
illustrate
topic
and
conclusion
sentences.
Debate
has
two
very
similar
ways
of
describing
this
idea,
except
with
more
detail.
One
way
to
organize
a
debate
argument
is
using
NCWIO
(claim,
warrant,
impact).
The
claim
says
what
I
am
trying
to
prove
in
that
argument,
which
is
similar
to
a
topic
sentence.
The
warrant
is
the
evidence
I
use
to
prove
that
claim.
The
impact
is
why
my
claim
matters
for
the
case
as
a
whole,
which
is
similar
to
a
conclusion
sentence.
Another
way
to
organize
a
debate
argument,
which
I
think
is
the
most
transferrable
skill,
is
using
NTEALO
(tag,
evidence,
analysis,
link).
The
tag
and
the
link
work
the
same
as
a
topic
sentence
and
conclusion
sentence,
respectively.
The
evidence
is
the
same
idea
as
a
warrant.
But
the
added
part
in
this
method
is
analysis.
This
brought
my
writing
up
to
a
much
stronger
level.
Instead
of
just
giving
a
quote
from
a
book
or
a
historical
fact
to
prove
my
claim,
I
added
analysis
underneath
that
evidence.
This
seems
simpler
than
it
actually
is,
as
I
learned
the
hard
way.
It
took
a
very
long
time
for
me
to
add
unique
analysis,
as
opposed
to
a
repetitive
reiteration
of
the
evidence.
This
skill
took
me
a
long
time
to
develop
but
has
certainly
paid
off
by
preparing
for
college
writing.
Finally,
in
every
single
debate
round,
there
is
a
judge
filling
out
a
ballot
and
deciding
the
winner.
Often,
the
judge
will
end
the
round
by
giving
oral
feedback
as
well.
Since
it
is
a
competitive
activity,
and
the
judges
are
the
key
to
winning
rounds,
I
always
listened
to
their
oral
critique
and
read
the
ballot
after
the
tournament.
I
used
that
criticism
to
help
me
become
a
better
debater.
It
also
made
me
realize
how
often
I
get
a
paper
back
from
a
teacher
and
forget
about
it.
Usually
teachers
write
comments
throughout
the
paper
and
at
the
end
of
it.
But
all
I
ever
looked
at
was
the
grade.
Recognizing
the
importance
of
a
judgeOs
feedback
in
debate
made
me
realize
how
important
a
teacherOs
feedback
is
on
my
papers.
At
the
very
least,
making
the
same
mistake
on
multiple
papers
is
a
waste
of
time
and
effort.
Internalizing
a
teacherOs
feedback
is
one
of
the
easiest
ways
to
make
sure
I
am
constantly
improving
as
a
writer.
