This
is
the
story
of
a
four
year
old
little
girl
who
would
watch
out
the
window
as
her
two
older
sisters
got
on
the
school
bus
everyday
and
left.
Sure
spending
time
with
her
mom
was
fun,
and
yeah,
I
guess
her
two
year
old
little
brother
could
be
cute.
Yet
nothing
quite
compared
to
her
older
sisters,
her
idols.
Everyday
she
would
play
alone
in
the
house
and
count
down
the
hours
until
the
big
yellow
bus
returned,
and
with
it,
her
sisters.
They
came
bounding
into
the
house,
demanding
after
school
snacks
and
going
on
and
on
about
their
day
at
school.
School,
where
the
big
kids
went.
The
little
girl
would
listen
in
interest
to
stories
about
new
friends
and
beloved
teachers.
Her
sisters
would
brag
about
being
able
to
read
and
write
and
add
and
subtract.
Now,
before
you
feel
sorry
for
this
little
girl,
understand
that
her
sisters
loved
to
teach
her
what
they
learned.
Countless
hours
were
spent
in
front
of
a
chalkboard
in
the
basement.
I
remember
those
hours.
I
remember
this
was
when
I
first
learned
how
to
write.
I
remember
when
my
sister,
Erin,
was
learning
cursive.
I
remember
her
trying
to
teach
it
to
me,
and
I
remember
that
I
had
no
idea
what
I
was
doing.
Nevertheless,
that
did
not
stop
me
from
scribbling
loopy
lines
on
paper
and
taping
those
papers
all
around
my
house.
My
mom
proceeded
to
ask
me
what
the
papers
were,
and
I
told
her
I
wrote
a
story
in
cursive.
As
far
as
I
can
recall,
this
was
my
first
experience
with
writing.
I
am
not
quite
sure
if
it
counts
as
actual
writing
in
terms
of
the
way
I
view
it
now,
but
for
my
four-year-old
self,
it
counted.
My
first
legitimate
experience
with
writing
was
in
second
grade.
My
teacher
gave
me
my
very
own
blue
book
to
write
in
when
I
finished
assignments
early.
The
same
type
of
blue
book
that
I
now
take
exams
in.
As
far
as
I
remember,
there
were
only
a
few
students
who
got
this
privilege
in
Mrs.
TorcasioOs
second
grade
class.
At
that
point,
writing
in
my
blue
book
made
me
feel
special.
I
got
to
share
with
my
teacher
anything
that
I
wanted.
Sometimes
she
would
prompt
me
to
write
about
my
weekend,
or
my
family,
but
most
of
the
time
I
had
freedom.
I
used
to
love
writing
silly
poems
and
short
stories.
Whether
they
were
actually
good,
well,
that
is
another
story.
Looking
back,
I
am
very
thankful
that
I
had
the
opportunity
at
a
young
age
to
not
only
practice
writing,
but
to
learn
how
enjoyable
it
can
be.
In
addition
to
writing,
I
have
always
loved
reading.
My
older
sisters
used
to
read
Harry
Potter
to
my
brother
and
I
at
night.
This
was
very
influential
for
me
because
I
became
convinced
that
I
would
one
day
become
the
next
J.K.
Rowling.
I
used
to
brainstorm
silly
characters
and
twisted
plots.
I
would
sit
at
the
computer
and
string
together
a
few
paragraphs
and
then
save
the
file
under
some
obscure
name
so
no
one
in
my
family
would
ever
find
it.
I
have
always
been
a
little
shy
when
it
comes
to
sharing
my
unfinished
writing
assignments.
At
one
point
in
my
childhood,
I
decided
that
reading
was
more
fun
than
writing.
I
wish
that
I
could
remember
when
or
why,
but
regardless,
it
has
not
changed.
I
do
not
dislike
writing
now
by
any
means,
I
just
really
love
reading.
When
I
was
younger,
writing
was
a
way
for
me
to
creatively
express
myself
and
the
way
I
was
feeling.
Another
thing
that
I
used
to
do
was
keep
a
daily
diary,
this
little
Winnie
the
Pooh
journal
with
a
gold
clasp.
I
would
do
my
best
to
write
in
it
every
night,
tucking
it
safely
away
in
my
nightstand
drawer
once
I
was
done.
I
kept
that
up
for
about
a
year
or
so.
To
this
day,
I
still
have
it.
When
I
read
it
now,
I
feel
embarrassed
about
the
stuff
I
used
to
say.
I
guess
IOm
a
little
hard
on
myself,
which
is
an
issue
I
struggle
with
these
days
when
I
am
writing.
In
addition
to
the
Winnie
the
Pooh
diary,
I
also
kept
a
journal
whenever
my
family
went
on
vacation.
I
loved
the
idea
of
documenting
special
experiences,
and
to
this
day
I
still
do
my
best
to
do
so.
I
went
to
Italy
this
past
summer
and
every
day
of
the
trip,
before
bed,
I
would
write
in
my
journal.
When
I
was
younger
it
was
a
lot
more
of
NWe
did
this
and
then
we
went
here,O
whereas
now
I
tend
to
include
a
lot
more
about
how
I
feel
about
what
I
experienced.
In
that
sense,
my
writing
has
certainly
matured.
I
would
say
that
during
second
and
third
grade
writing
was
a
creative
outlet
through
which
I
had
a
lot
of
fun
and
felt
as
though
I
was
able
to
express
myself.
Once
I
got
to
fourth
grade,
that
changed.
Writing
suddenly
meant
book
reports.
Book
report
after
book
report
after
book
report.
I
had
one
teacher
who
wanted
one
every
month,
and
for
a
fourth
grader,
that
is
a
whole
lot
of
book
reports.
I
became
sick
of
writing.
I
felt
stifled
by
the
strict
requirements
my
teacher
had
imposed
on
me.
I
did
not
like
all
of
the
formatting
and
the
limitations.
Regardless,
I
found
that
I
always
received
positive
feedback
on
my
writing.
Once
I
reached
fifth
grade,
I
was
placed
into
an
accelerated
English
program.
My
teacher
completely
transformed
my
view
of
writing.
She
gave
us
creative
assignments
that
really
forced
me
to
think
outside
the
box.
I
feel
that
it
was
because
of
her
that
my
interest
in
writing
was
renewed.
I
went
into
middle
school
confident
about
my
writing
and
excited
to
learn
more.
However,
the
focus
of
English
shifted
towards
grammar,
and
I
once
again
began
to
lose
interest.
While
I
understood
that
grammar
was
important,
I
was
bored
out
of
my
mind.
It
felt
as
though
once
again,
writing
shifted
from
being
a
creative
process
to
a
strict
one.
During
this
time,
my
love
for
math
and
science
began
to
grow
while
I
let
writing
fall
to
the
wayside.
I
no
longer
kept
any
type
of
journal
or
diary.
I
would
complete
papers
for
the
sake
of
checking
them
off
my
to-do
list,
and
I
found
no
enjoyment
in
them.
This
continued
on
in
eighth
grade.
The
focus
then
was
on
a
standardized
test
that
everyone
in
the
school
had
to
pass
in
order
to
graduate.
Even
though
I
was
in
an
accelerated
English
class,
we
still
spent
90
percent
of
our
time
preparing
for
the
test.
We
would
practice
the
styles
of
writing
that
were
expected
of
us
on
the
test.
This
included
picture
prompts
and
persuasive
essays.
I
mean,
no
wonder
I
began
to
lose
interest
in
writing.
Everything
was
timed
and
I
felt
stressed
and
pressured.
While
I
still
did
very
well
in
the
class
and
on
the
test,
I
had
completely
given
up
on
writing.
Then
came
high
school.
My
freshman
year
English
teacher
was
amazing.
The
roller
coaster
of
ups
and
downs
continued
for
me.
I
went
from
hating
writing
to
loving
it,
yet
again.
My
teacher
integrated
a
lot
of
the
novels
we
were
reading
into
our
writing,
and
I
really
appreciated
that.
She
would
provide
helpful
feedback.
I
feel
as
though
my
writing
abilities
flourished
under
her
direction.
Unlike
eighth
grade,
the
focus
shifted
towards
the
individualOs
progress
and
growth
as
a
writer,
as
opposed
to
preparing
students
to
pass
a
test.
It
was
a
whole
new
world.
I
also
remember
feeling
a
lot
more
challenged
freshman
year.
Someone
was
finally
pushing
me
to
improve,
and
to
think
more
critically.
I
feel
as
though
that
class
was
helpful
in
preparing
me
for
future
writing
in
analyzing
and
responding
to
various
types
of
text.
Sophomore
year
was
again
challenging
for
me.
I
was
required
to
do
a
lot
of
writing
for
two
of
my
classes.
I
took
AP
Government
in
addition
to
Honors
English.
I
did
not
particularly
like
either
of
my
teachers
for
those
classes,
which
did
not
help
me
much.
I
feel
as
though
who
my
teachers
were
had
a
huge
impression
on
my
development
as
a
writer.
My
English
class
spent
a
lot
of
time
debating
and
discussing
and
getting
off
track.
Our
writing
assignments
did
not
always
connect
to
what
we
were
doing
in
the
classroom,
and
that
really
frustrated
me.
Everything
felt
like
busy
work.
It
did
not
help
that
my
teacher
picked
favorites
based
on
who
was
the
most
outspoken
during
class,
and
so
I
never
quite
felt
comfortable
submitting
my
work
to
him.
I
always
felt
as
though
he
was
judging
me.
As
a
result,
I
could
not
express
myself
and
that
affected
my
writing
quite
a
bit.
Interestingly,
in
my
AP
Government
class,
I
was
not
having
any
problems
with
my
writing.
I
was
writing
fact-based
papers
and
everything
seemed
straight
forward.
I
was
not
necessarily
enjoying
what
I
was
writing,
but
I
did
not
hate
it
either.
It
seemed
to
come
naturally
to
me.
Perhaps
the
most
pivotal
year
for
me
as
a
writer
was
my
junior
year
of
high
school.
I
believe
it
was
a
combination
of
my
own
personal
maturity
with
having
another
sensational
teacher.
Ms.
Bunje
was
unlike
any
teacher
I
had
ever
had
before.
At
first,
I
was
unsure
of
whether
I
would
like
her.
As
time
went
on,
my
respect
for
her
grew
as
I
realized
that
I
was
becoming
not
only
a
better
writer,
but
also
a
better
person.
Ms.
Bunje
forced
us
to
dig
deep
into
the
depths
of
our
minds,
as
well
as
our
hearts.
She
posed
questions
that
encouraged
self-reflection.
These
deep
moments
were
shared
not
only
during
class
time,
but
also
after
hours
on
a
blog
site
she
created
for
our
class.
We
were
required
to
post,
but
not
limited
to,
one
blog
a
week.
The
post
answered
a
question
that
she
posed
to
us,
often
requiring
thoughtful
responses.
To
this
day,
I
still
have
access
to
the
blog.
It
is
interesting
to
look
back
and
see
how
my
ideas
have
changed
about
certain
topics,
and
how
my
values
have
stayed
the
same.
I
really
took
pleasure
in
blogging,
because
I
felt
it
was
therapeutic
in
a
way.
I
was
able
to
share
my
views
while
also
reading
about
my
classmates.
It
helped
that
Ms.
Bunje
created
an
environment
among
our
class
where
students
felt
comfortable
sharing
their
opinions
and
thoughts.
In
Ms.
BunjeOs
class,
I
also
began
to
learn
and
practice
multiple
genres
of
writing.
She
completely
broke
us
out
of
five-paragraph-essay
mode.
In
fact,
she
would
grade
us
poorly
if
our
essays
were
structured
as
five
paragraph
essays.
She
introduced
us
to
reading
and
writing
poetry,
short
stories,
narration
essays,
descriptive
essays,
and
a
few
other
types.
We
were
also
responsible
for
writing
what
she
called
an,
NOccasional
paper,O
once
a
marking
period.
This
was
to
be
written
about
any
topic
of
our
choice,
and
read
aloud
to
the
class.
It
could
be
as
long
or
as
short
as
we
wanted,
in
any
style
we
wanted.
As
long
as
we
did
it,
we
got
an
A
for
the
assignment.
I
really
appreciated
the
creative
assignments
that
she
implemented
into
our
learning.
I
think
that
being
introduced
to
all
types
of
writing
made
me
appreciate
it
more.
I
also
feel
that
through
many
different
writing
experiences
I
was
able
to
find
my
voice,
and
develop
my
own
tone.
I
went
into
senior
year
feeling
very
proud
of
my
writing
abilities.
I
finally
felt
like
everything
made
sense.
All
of
the
skills
I
had
learned
in
previous
years
were
tied
together
nicely
during
my
junior
year.
I
was
ready
to
tackle
any
challenges
that
AP
Literature
threw
at
me.
Turns
out,
I
was
not
as
ready
as
I
thought.
Once
again,
my
feelings
towards
writing
were
manipulated
by
a
teacher.
My
teacher
was
the
complete
opposite
of
Ms.
Bunje
in
every
way
possible.
She
was
a
huge
proponent
of
five
paragraph
essays
and
would
grade
us
poorly
if
we
did
not
write
one.
In
addition,
she
was
against
most
types
of
creative
expression.
She
wanted
us
to
dive
into
our
essays,
present
the
information
in
a
succinct
manner,
and
quickly
wrap
things
up.
Her
idea
of
a
good
paper
was
one
which
was
strictly
analytical
and
fact-based.
Going
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
really
set
me
back.
I
had
to
completely
adjust
the
way
I
approached
essays.
I
struggled
with
fitting
her
requirements
while
trying
to
keep
my
own
tone.
I
feel
as
though
my
whole
class
went
through
similar
challenges
as
I
did.
Many
of
us
suffered
the
wrath
of
our
teacher
because
it
took
a
lot
of
time
to
adjust
to
her
requirements.
It
is
difficult
to
unlearn,
so
to
speak.
In
a
way,
this
benefitted
me
because
I
found
myself
clinging
onto
a
lot
of
my
knowledge
and
experience
from
junior
year.
Although
I
could
not
use
it
for
class,
I
recognized
that
it
was
important
to
remember.
I
graduated
high
school
feeling
somewhat
apprehensive
about
college
writing.
My
sisters
gave
me
the
scoop,
and
told
me
to
expect
writing
papers
consistently
longer
than
five
pages.
In
my
mind,
I
could
not
process
that.
However,
I
learned
very
quickly
that
it
was
the
case.
Freshman
year
I
had
a
wonderful
experience
with
my
FYS.
I
felt
completely
in
tune
with
the
Professor
and
what
she
was
asking
of
us.
She
reminded
me
a
lot
of
Ms.
Bunje
in
the
sense
that
she
encouraged
creativity
and
imagination.
I
think
that
my
introduction
to
college
writing
was
a
very
positive
one.
While
it
was
certainly
an
adjustment,
the
transition
went
very
smoothly.
I
became
accustomed
to
writing
multiple
pages
and
to
putting
a
lot
of
time
into
my
writing.
I
cared
a
lot
about
what
I
was
saying,
and
focused
on
producing
work
that
I
was
proud
of.
It
was
not
always
easy,
but
I
made
it
a
priority.
Being
passionate
about
the
topics
I
was
writing
about
helped
me
a
lot.
As
freshman
year
went
on,
I
found
myself
writing
a
lot
for
my
science
classes.
I
am
a
Neuroscience
major
so
I
find
that
a
lot
of
my
writing
is
for
lab
reports
or
scientific
essays.
In
some
ways,
this
comes
easy
to
me.
It
is
interesting
how
I
really
value
creative
pieces
as
well
as
scientific
ones.
I
also
enjoy
writing
for
my
Anthropology
and
Sociology
classes,
which
is
my
minor,
because
the
subject
material
is
so
interesting
to
me.
As
college
has
gone
on,
I
find
that
when
I
receive
a
writing
assignment,
whatever
it
may
be,
I
get
excited.
I
have
come
to
appreciate
multiple
types
of
writing,
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
I
ultimately
decided
to
be
a
WriterOs
Associate.
I
am
so
excited
to
continue
to
grow
as
a
writer.
I
recognize
that
there
is
always
work
to
be
done,
and
I
look
forward
to
helping
others
with
their
own
personal
writing
challenges
while
I
work
through
mine.
