The
first
recollection
I
have
of
writing
is
practicing
to
print
the
alphabet
back
when
I
was
in
the
first
grade.
I
remember
enjoying
writing
because
I
was
a
quick
learner,
but
I
also
remember
becoming
angry
because,
even
back
then,
I
had
horrible
penmanship
and
I
hated
the
way
my
letters
appeared
on
that
thin
brown
paper.
Learning
cursive
was
even
worse
for
me
because
my
handwriting
simply
became
worse
and
worse.
Eventually,
my
script
became
so
bad
that
the
only
people
who
could
transcribe
it
were
my
teachers
and
myself.
To
this
day
I
have
such
horrible
handwriting
that
I
type
everything,
including
letters
to
my
friends.
I
think
that
my
handwriting
has
had
a
great
influence
on
the
way
in
which
I
write
due
to
the
fact
that
I
never
write
papers
by
hand
before
I
type
them.
Instead,
I
have
been
typing
my
papers
on
a
computer
since
the
eleventh
grade.
Because
of
this
I
have
evolved
a
certain
writing
style
such
that
I
rarely
produce
a
rough
draft
unless
forced
to
do
so
by
an
assignment.
Instead,
my
paper
is
constantly
in
flux
as
I
study
each
word
as
it
is
typed
on
to
the
page.
Although
this
method
is
slow
(it
usually
takes
me
about
an
hour
per
page
on
a
serious
paper)
it
is
also
successful.
I
generally
enjoy
writing
papers
because
I
usually
do
well
on
them.
While
I
realize
the
technique
I
use
is
not
and
would
not
be
successful
for
everyone,
it
seems
to
be
the
most
effective
style
for
me.
Another
early
memory
I
have
of
writing
is
the
infamous
book
reports
starting
in
the
fourth
grade.
I
never
enjoyed
writing
book
reports.
I
felt
they
were
stupid
and
a
waste
of
time.
I
think
this
partly
stems
from
the
fact
that
I
did
not
enjoy
reading
at
that
time
of
my
life,
at
least
I
did
not
enjoy
reading
the
books
required
for
a
book
report.
As
a
result,
I
was
never
very
successful
with
my
reports,
a
fact
which
I
think
discouraged
me
with
writing
as
a
whole
for
quite
some
time.
Fifth
grade
brought
with
it
explanatory,
descriptive,
persuasive,
etc.,
paragraphs.
Once
again
I
did
not
enjoy
writing
these
short
assignments.
In
fact,
I
hated
writing
paragraphs.
I
believe
a
big
reason
for
this
is
because
it
would
take
me
a
very
long
time
to
write
a
single
paragraph.
As
a
result,
I
usually
received
high
grades,
but
I
was
frustrated
by
the
amount
of
time
it
would
take
me
to
write
a
simple
paragraph.
However,
I
did
learn
a
lot
from
this
experience.
It
was
at
this
point
that
I
was
first
introduced
to
topic
sentences
and
closing
statements,
predecessors
of
the
introductory
paragraphs,
theses,
and
summary
paragraphs
of
longer
essays.
Upon
entering
my
freshman
year
at
high
school,
I
was
presented
with
my
most
difficult
writing
course
up
until
that
time.
I
took
an
advanced
course
in
world
history
in
which
I
was
required
to
write
several
in-class
essays.
This
was
the
first
time
I
had
a
time
limit
on
my
writing.
I
did
very
poorly
on
these
essays
and
thought
that
they
were
extremely
difficult.
I
did
improve
my
essay
skills,
however,
by
a
great
degree
because
I
learned
how
to
structure
my
writing
and
to
be
more
focused
in
order
to
produce
a
higher
degree
of
quality
in
my
work.
Another
memorable
experience
which
occurred
freshman
year
pertains
to
a
creative
writing
assignment
I
had
in
my
English
course.
I
wrote
a
fictitious
short
story
which
was
read
in
front
of
the
class.
My
story
was
voted
the
best
in
the
class.
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
writing
that
fictitious
story.
It
was
one
of
the
first
times
in
quite
a
while
that
I
actually
liked
writing.
Presently,
I
am
not
an
exceptionally
good
creative
writer,
but
every
once
and
a
while
I
enjoy
sitting
down
in
front
of
my
computer
and
typing
until
I
see
where
it
leads
me.
The
turning
point
in
my
writing
history
occurred
in
my
eleventh
grade
history
course.
It
was
in
this
course
where
I
was
required
to
write
an
essay
every
two
or
three
weeks
(something
unprecedented
in
my
young,
high
school
career).
I
recall
having
difficulty
on
my
essays
the
first
semester
of
the
course.
However,
during
the
second
semester
I
started
writing
solid
essays
and,
more
importantly,
I
actually
enjoyed
doing
it.
Ironically
(or
perhaps,
fittingly),
it
was
around
this
time
when
I
got
my
first
computer.
From
that
point
forward,
I
have
written
all
my
essays
on
a
computer.
My
teacher
noticed
the
improvements
on
my
papers
and
gave
me
positive
feedback
in
regard
to
them.
I
think
that
it
was
at
this
point
that
I
finally
achieved
the
self-confidence
that
I
am
a
good
writer.
I
have
never
been
afraid
to
write
a
paper
since
the
eleventh
grade
because
I
have
the
assuredness
that
I
will
do
well
on
my
essays.
My
first
major
challenge
also
occurred
in
the
eleventh
grade:
a
fifteen
page
research
paper.
This
paper
was
very
tedious
for
me
because
I
was
not
used
to
doing
so
much
research
for
one
paper.
This
was
the
assignment
that
laid
the
groundwork
for
my
future
research
papers
in
college.
Reading
this
paper
now,
after
a
couple
of
years
at
college,
I
find
it
hard
to
believe
how
poorly
I
used
to
write.
That
paper
was
a
major
accomplishment
for
me
at
the
time,
but
compared
to
college,
or
academic,
writing
it
is
not
very
well
written.
I
see
now
how
it
was
simply
another
step
in
the
process
of
my
continual
maturation
in
writing.
Upon
entering
college,
I
had
the
self-confidence
to
feel
that
I
was
prepared
to
write
at
the
college
level.
I
had
a
great
freshmen
seminar
class,
and
I
was
excited
about
the
first
paper.
Needless
to
say,
I
was
shocked
when
that
first
paper
came
back
with
a
C
marked
on
the
front.
That
is
when
I
realized
that
I
still
had
quite
a
bit
of
learning
to
do
before
I
would
be
ready
for
college
level
writing.
I
worked
hard
in
my
seminar
class,
and
I
improved
my
writing
skills
a
great
deal.
Since
that
first
paper,
I
have
yet
to
receive
as
low
of
a
grade
on
any
subsequent
paper
I
have
written.
While
I
realize
that
I
am
continually
learning
to
write
in
a
more
academic
manner
and
that
I
have
not
yet
come
close
to
professional
standards,
I
do
attribute
my
seminar
class
with
teaching
me
how
to
write
in
an
intelligent,
thoughtful,
cohesive
manner.
For
the
past
fourteen
years
I
have
been
in
a
continual
learning
and
developmental
process
in
regards
to
my
writing
ability.
The
many
writing
events
in
my
life,
of
which
I
have
mentioned
only
a
few,
have
all
helped
to
shape
my
unique
writing
style.
While
I
have
not
enjoyed
all
of
these
experiences,
I
realize
that
they
were
necessary
for
my
individual
writing
development.
