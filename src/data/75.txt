Literacy
Narrative
Mrs.
Hall,
my
fourth
grade
teacher,
assigned
my
first
writing
assignment
that
I
can
recall.
This
assignment
was
to
write
and
illustrate
a
fictional
childrens'
book.
This
seemed
a
very
broad
assignment
for
ten
year-olds,
so
she
advised
each
student
to
write
about
something
the
student
knew
about
and
liked.
In
fourth
grade,
I
did
not
know
much,
but
I
did
know
what
I
liked.
One
thing
I
enjoyed
was
playing
clubhouse
with
my
brother
and
cousin,
so
I
took
Mrs.
Hall's
advice
and
wrote
Cara
and
the
Kittens,
a
book
about
our
imaginary
adventures.
The
story
of
my
childhood
game
grew
into
more
than
just
a
one-time
writing
project.
Mrs.
Hall
was
delighted
with
my
book
and
encouraged
me
to
continue
writing
by
keeping
a
journal.
In
my
journal
I
wrote
about
my
day
and
the
dreams
I
had
had
the
night
before,
along
with
a
few
short
stories.
One
project
that
escaped
the
pages
of
my
journal
was
a
poem
rolled
up
in
a
giant
scroll
that
I
had
written
when
I
was
mad
at
my
parents.
It
listed
the
alphabet
vertically
down
the
left
side
of
the
paper,
each
letter
was
used
as
a
line
of
my
poem
(for
example,
All
day
I
sit,
Bored
doing
Chores).
My
family
thought
the
poem
and
my
imagination
were
amusing
and
laminated
the
five
foot
scroll
to
hang
on
my
door.
My
imagination
proved
useful
again
in
seventh
grade
for
my
next
writing
assignment.
Each
student
in
my
class
was
once
again
assigned
to
write
and
illustrate
a
fictional
childrens'
book.
This
time
I
wrote
a
story
of
a
magical
desert
kingdom
entitled
Dribble,
Dribble
go
the
Sands
of
Time.
In
this
book,
the
characters
were
looking
for
the
hourglass
of
time,
which
had
been
stolen
by
the
evil
prince
of
darkness.
They
had
to
recover
the
hourglass
before
nightfall
or
it
would
be
dark
forever.
I
enjoyed
this
writing
assignment
as
much
as
my
fourth
grade
story
and
received
many
compliments
on
my
book.
In
eighth
grade
every
girl
in
my
class
entered
a
poetry
phase.
We
would
sit
in
study
hall
and
create
line
after
line
of
rhyming
poetry.
After
one
of
us
completed
one
of
these
sappy
poems,
she
would
read
it
aloud
to
the
group
who,
in
turn,
responded
with
noteworthy
praise.
Since
all
of
our
poems
were
found
exceptional
by
the
group,
we
decided
to
send
them
to
Seventeen
magazine's
poetry
contest.
Much
to
our
disbelief,
Seventeen
did
not
find
our
poems
worthy
of
publishing.
I
did
not
enjoy
writing
poetry
so
I
was
not
heartbroken
ending
this
stage
of
my
writing
career.
My
completion
of
the
eighth
grade
took
me
across
the
street
to
the
high
school
and
into
a
different
style
of
writing.
Instead
of
writing
fiction,
I
had
been
tossed
into
a
world
of
reports
on
history,
science,
and
assigned
books.
It
did
not
take
long
for
me
to
begin
to
dislike
this
kind
of
writing
because
I
felt
like
I
was
simply
regurgitating
already
published
facts.
A
set
of
writing
rules
such
as
never
use
I
were
introduced
to
me
during
this
shift
in
my
writing
career.
These
rules
limited
me
and
made
me
feel
that
my
opinion
was
insignificant.
One
time
in
particular
that
these
rules
really
restrained
me
was
in
tenth
grade.
My
entire
grade
was
assigned
to
write
a
paper
entitled
The
Voice
of
Democracy
for
a
chance
at
a
five
hundred
dollar
scholarship
from
my
town's
VFW.
The
paper
was
to
be
about
our
country
and
where
I
saw
it
heading
in
the
future,,
This
paper
was
difficult
to
write
without
breaking
the
I
rule
since
the
topic
was
clearly
asking
for
my
specific
opinion.
It
was
also
difficult
because
Mrs.
Hall
words
of
write
about
something
you
know
and
like
were
ringing
through
my
head.
I
did
not
know
or
like
this
topic
at
all.
This
was
my
worst
writing
experience
and
needless
to
say,
the
VFW
was
not
knocking
down
my
door
with
a
scholarship
check.
No
matter
how
repressing
I
had
found
the
democracy
essay,
it
was
obvious
that
I
had
to
accept
the
assignment
and
its
rules
in
order
to
move
on
to
the
next
step
in
my
high
school
writing
career.
This
step
was
the
dreaded
junior
year
term
paper.
Each
year
before
me
I
had
heard
juniors
moan
over
the
laborious
task
of
this
twelve
page
research
paper,
so
I
was
a
little
intimidated.
However,
it
was
not
as
painful
as
I
had
expected.
The
topic
of
the
paper
had
to
deal
either
with
American
history
or
a
novel
we
had
just
read'that
year.
I
had
just
finished
The
Great
Gatsby
and
had
enjoyed
it
very
much
so
I
chose
to
write
my
paper
on
the
book's
femme
fatale,
Daisy
Buchanan.
This
project
followed
Mrs.
Hall's
golden
rule
of
writing,
which
I
had
now
adapted
for
all
papers
when
the
topic
was
my
choice.
I
loved
writing
my
term
paper,
partly
because
of
my
topic
and
partly
because
of
my
growing
interest
in
research.
I
found
it
amazing
how
many
books
were
actually
written
on
Daisy.
It
was
exciting
to
learn
what
other
people
thought
of
Daisy
and
compare
my
opinions
to
theirs.
I
took
pride
in
my
research
paper
and
it
showed
by
the
extra
work
I
put
into
it.
I
was
to
follow
an
extremely
organized
manner
of
writing
and
every
student
had
to
hand
in
the
steps
leading
up
to
the
final
paper.
These
steps
included
notecards,
a
working
bibliography,
an
outline,
and
an
introductory
paragraph.
I
turned
all
these
prewriting
steps
and
my
final
paper
with
a
true
feeling
of
accomplishment,
a
feeling
that
was
matched
when
my
paper
was
returned
to
me
with
a
ninety-seven
percent
written
on
top.
After
completing
the
year
of
the
term
paper,
I
advanced
to
my
senior
year
and
the
project
that
awaited
me,
that
is,
the
college
application
essay.
I
was
using
the
common
application,
therefore
my
essay
could
be
used
at
many
colleges.
The
topic
of
this
essay
was
Name
someone
who
has
had
a
significant
influence
on
your
life
and
describe
that
influence.
My
significant
individual
was
Joey
Carricato,
a
six
year-old
with
Downs
syndrome.
I
chose
Joey
because
he
changed
my
view
on
people
with
disabilities
and
I
knew
that
if
my
paper
was
well
written
it
would
stick
in
the
minds
of
the
admissions
staff
because
of
its
originality.
I
asked
my
former
English
teacher,
Mr.
Fry,
to
review
my
essay
and
make
sure
that
it
would
be
a
memorable
one.
Together
we
worked
through
my
essay
and
discussed
what
could
be
done
to
make
it
a
clearer,
more
concise
paper.
These
improving
sessions
were
my
first
serious
attempts
at
revising
and
rewriting.
In
my
earlier
writing,
I
could
afford
to
simply
write
a
paper,
spell
check
it,
a
hand
it
in,
subject
to
a
few
deductions.
However,
this
essay
could
mean
acceptance
or
rejection
and
I
feared
errors
and
poor
construction
would
be
obvious
in
a
one
and
one-half
page
paper.
So
after
working
hard
on
this
essay
with
Mr.
Fry,
I
sent
it
off
to
seven
colleges
with
a
degree
of
confidence.
This
confidence
in
my
college
essay
did
not
transpire
into
self-assurance
in
college
writing.
I
had
heard
nothing
but
horror
stories
from
college
students
in
my
town
about
how
our
high
school
did
not
adequately
prepare
students
for
college
composition
classes.
So
I
headed
off
to
Lafayette
College
with
little
confidence
in
my
writing
ability.
That
little
confidence
dwindled
to
zero
confidence
as
soon
as
I
stepped
into
my
first
year
seminar
(FYS)
class.
My
classmates
and
I
could
see
immediately
we
had
been
assigned
a
no-nonsense
composition
professor.
Our
first
assignment
had
been
a
literacy
narrative
just
like
what
you
are
reading
now.
I
did
not
like
writing
it
the
first
time
and
I
do
not
like
writing
it
now.
It
is
challenging
for
me
because
I
do
not
know
how
to
write
this
paper
without
feeling
that
I
am
filling
in
open
ended
sentences,
for
example,
I
felt...My
professor
said...
I
handed
this
first
paper
in
feeling
apprehensive
but
looking
forward
to
a
grade
to
use
as
a
starting
point.
However,
this
paper
was
returned
to
me,
as
many
were
that
semester,
gradeless.
I
found
these
gradeless
papers
frustrating
and
discouraging.
Not
as
discouraging
as
the
fact
that
I
could
not
figure
out
what
this
professor
wanted
from
me.
As
soon
as
I
handed
in
a
paper,
a
paper
was
returned
to
me
with
X's
and
comments
followed
by
many
exclamation
marks.
I
tried
to
fix
these
errors
but
to
no
avail.
Writing
what
I
thought
my
professor
wanted
to
hear
had
the
same
results.
It
was
not
her
though,
it
was
me.
I
could
not
see
the
obvious,
that
is,
I
had
not
made
the
connection
between
reading
and
writing.
I
could
not
simply
correct
what
she
had
marked
on
my
drafts;
I
had
to
reread
my
essay
and
study
both
the
paper
and
the
professors
comments.
Unfortunately,
I
did
not
discover
this
until
my
final
paper.
Although
I
was
still
far
from
having
a
handle
on
college
writing,
my
FYS
class
and
professor
had
helped
to
give
me
a
loose
grasp.
I
knew
some
of
my
common
errors
(unrelated
sentences)
and
how
to
catch
them
(read
aloud).
Having
one
of
the
schools
toughest
professors
at
first
seemed
an
awful
fate,
however,
in
retrospect,
I
can
see
it
paid
off.
My
writing
did
improve
in
my
FYS
class
and
my
confidence
level
was
rising.
My
first
year
writing
(FYW)
class
continued
to
restore
both
my
confidence
and
my
love
for
writing.
The
title
of
my
FYW
was
The
Book
Clinic
and
our
semester
project
was
to
present
a
book
proposal
for
a
nonfiction
book
along
with
a
few
chapters
of
a
book
in
progress.
Although
fictional
writing
was
my
favorite,
nonfiction
for
this
project
was
satisfactory
with
me
because
I
got
to
choose
my
own
topic.
I
remembered
my
term
paper
days
and
decided
to
take
that
route
again,
this
time
writing
about
another
one
of
America's
favorite
femme
fatales,
Scarlett
O'Hara.
Writing
the
first
chapter
of
this
book
was
as
enjoyable
and
rewarding
as
writing
my
term
paper.
The
research
was
interesting
and
my
professor
enjoyed
my
paper
enough
to
give
a
copy
of
it
to
the
class
as
an
example.
This
encouraged
my
writing
even
more
and
both
the
course
and
the
professor
helped
me
to
continue
improving
my
writing
skills.
At
the
end
of
the
semester
I
faced
the
biggest
writing
challenge
of
my
life.
I
wanted
to
continue
improving
my
writing
and
I
saw
no
better
way
to
do
so
then
becoming
a
Writing
Associate
(WA).
I
filled
out
the
application,
attached
two
previously
written
assignments,
and
wrote
a
creative
and
witty
one
page
story
about
why
I
wanted
to
become
a
WA.
I
took
this
application
seriously
because
becoming
a
WA
was
a
goal
that
I
needed
to
reach
to
know
that
my
writing
was
improving.
I
revised
all
three
papers
numerous
times
and
sought
out
the
opinions
of
friends
and
professors.
When
I
handed
my
application
in
I
was
confident
that
I
had
done
my
best.
When
I
was
accepted
into
the
program
I
felt
like
I
had
truly
accomplished
something
with
my
writing
in
my
freshman
year.
This
is
where
my
writing
career
mow
stands,
and
I
look
forward
to
improving
my
writing
and
helping
others
improve
theirs
through
this
program.
