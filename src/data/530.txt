Writing
As
a
WA
Writing
has
always
been
an
immensely
pivotal
part
of
my
life.
This
past
year
as
a
Writing
Associate
definitely
made
a
significant
impact
on
many
aspects
of
my
personal
writing
and
the
way
I
feel
about
the
writing
process
in
general.
Becoming
part
of
the
College
Writing
Program
definitely
changed
my
own
views
and
personal
expectations,
but
most
importantly,
it
forced
me
to
think
about
writing
in
an
entirely
different
way.
This
additional
perspective
has
helped
me
enjoy
writing
more
and
greatly
appreciate
the
work
of
others,
whether
be
a
famous
author,
a
professor,
a
peer,
or
one
of
my
WA
students.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
motivated
me
to
think
about
writing
in
an
entirely
new
way.
As
a
WA,
I
was
able
to
concentrate
on
the
characteristics
that
make
writing
so
important
to
me,
instead
of
focusing
on
the
grammatical
and
mechanical
aspects
of
writing
and
editing.
Being
able
to
emphasize
and
implement
components
of
writing
such
as
creativity,
passion,
effort,
and
overall
content
meant
a
lot
to
me
because
I
feel
that
these
elements
are
overlooked
in
our
society
which
is
so
obsessed
with
perfection
and
technicalities.
I
loved
having
the
opportunity
to
stress
to
my
WA
students
that
concentrating
on
these
essentials
of
writing
is
far
more
important
than
obsessing
about
grammatical
details
or
the
grade
he
or
she
may
receive
on
a
particular
piece
of
writing.
Throughout
my
semester
as
a
WA
I
came
to
realize
what
a
grade
obsessed
society
we
live
in.
With
every
assignment
that
I
worked
on,
at
least
three
or
four
students
would
ask
me
what
grade
I
thought
they
would
get,
or
if
their
paper
was
A
material.
In
these
situations
I
found
the
Writing
Associate
handbook
to
be
a
very
advantageous
tool
in
explaining
that
evaluative
tasks
(such
as
assessing
grades)
were
not
a
part
of
the
call
of
duty
for
a
Writing
Associate.
I
tried
to
explain
to
my
students
that
WAOs
were
not
supposed
to
correct
or
judge
ones
work,
but
instead
serve
as
a
catalyst
in
helping
to
engage
the
writer
in
serious
discussion
about
their
work.
This
concept
was
unfamiliar
to
most
of
the
students
I
worked
with.
However,
after
focusing
on
the
benefits
that
it
brought,
it
became
something
that
they
understood
and
valued
more.
Many
of
my
students
had
never
before
thought
about
matters
such
as
audience,
context,
and
focus
while
they
were
writing.
Conversing
about
these
issues
during
my
appointments
with
them
helped
make
their
writing
process
easier
and
also
shifted
their
concentration
away
from
what
grade
they
may
receive.
By
the
end
of
the
semester
my
students
came
to
their
sessions
with
me
very
prepared
to
speak
about
their
writing
instead
of
ask
me
questions
or
expect
me
to
lecture
and
correct
on
what
they
had
done.
I
felt
this
was
a
vast
improvement
from
the
beginning
of
the
semester
and
hope
to
be
able
to
help
my
future
students
accomplish
it
as
well.
There
were
several
slightly
difficult
and
typical
problems
that
arose
in
the
way
that
my
students
dealt
with
their
experience
with
me
as
their
WA.
Since
I
was
working
with
first
semester
freshman,
many
were
unclear
about
how
serious
the
College
Writing
Program
is
and
chose
to
treat
me
as
an
optional
aspect
of
their
writing
process.
This
irritated
me
and
it
is
something
that
I
hope
becomes
less
of
an
issue
in
the
upcoming
semester.
Lateness
and
skipping
appointments
were
common
and
redundant
issues,
as
well
as
last-minute
cancellations.
Although
I
knew
that
I
should
not
have
taken
these
incidences
personally,
it
was
hard
for
me
not
to.
I
was
passionate
about
my
role
as
a
Writing
Associate
and
genuinely
cared
about
the
work
and
progress
of
my
students.
I
wanted
to
do
whatever
I
could
to
facilitate
the
writing
process
for
them;
however,
some
of
my
students
did
not
consider
meeting
with
me
a
priority.
Although
this
most
definitely
changed
toward
the
end,
I
hope
that
it
becomes
less
of
an
issue
in
the
future.
I
would
like
to
encourage
professors
(specifically
the
one
I
will
be
working
with)
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
meeting
with
a
WA
because
I
honestly
feel
that
doing
so
makes
students
more
prepared,
aware
and
conditioned
regarding
their
writing.
It
also
alleviated
much
of
the
anxiety
that
they
may
have
had
during
the
writing
process
and
was
a
very
worthwhile
tool
for
them
that
should
be
taken
seriously.
Through
meeting
with
my
students
on
a
regular
basis,
I
came
to
realize
how
pivotal
the
writing
process
is
to
ones
work.
The
professor
I
was
working
with
even
commented
that
it
was
evident
in
his
studentsO
writing
when
they
had
worked
with
me
because
their
ideas
were
more
organized
and
the
overall
quality
of
their
work
was
much
better.
This
subconsciously
improved
my
own
writing
because
I
never
before
contemplated
what
I
was
about
to
write
until
my
semester
as
a
WA.
I
always
tried
to
do
outlines
and
organize
my
ideas,
but
I
had
never
before
considered
the
audience
I
was
addressing.
This
was
innovative
in
my
personal
writing
process
and
it
is
now
something
that
I
critically
think
about
before
every
time
I
write.
Even
before
I
e-mail
someone,
I
make
sure
that
I
remember
who
I
am
writing
to.
I
also
take
into
account
the
tone
and
terms
I
feel
appropriate
to
use
with
that
particular
person.
This
has
ironically
increased
how
much
I
write
in
my
personal
journal
because
that
is
the
only
time
that
I
write
in
an
entirely
free
way,
without
being
preoccupied
with
my
audience
and
focus.
Although
I
enjoy
writing
outside
of
journaling,
I
greatly
appreciate
my
private
writing
now
because
it
is
the
only
time
I
creatively
compose
my
feelings,
thoughts,
and
ideas
without
thinking
of
the
other
people
involved
in
my
work.
This
has
been
a
great
outlet
for
me
and
is
one
of
the
benefits
I
value
most
from
my
time
as
a
WA.
During
my
semester
as
a
WA
I
was
able
to
engage
in
various
challenging
and
inspirational
conversations
about
other
peoplesO
writing,
my
own
writing,
and
literature
in
general.
I
felt
that
this
was
a
very
useful
way
to
go
about
the
editing
process
and
I
believe
that
it
encouraged
the
students
I
worked
with
to
be
more
excited
about
their
own
writing.
Emphasizing
the
relevance
of
active
discussion
in
the
writing
process
is
something
that
I
think
needs
to
be
done
more
often.
I
look
forward
to
comprehensively
executing
these
practices
in
my
conferences
and
staff
meetings
in
the
upcoming
semester.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
was
definitely
the
most
rewarding
and
thought-provoking
job
that
I
have
had
at
Lafayette
College
thus
far.
It
provided
me
with
a
unique
enthusiasm
and
intellectual
stimulation
that
I
had
not
found
while
working
as
a
Resident
Advisor
or
Student
Ambassador.
It
allowed
me
to
employ
my
knowledge
and
experience
to
help
others
but
also
taught
me
many
lessons
as
well.
In
actuality,
I
did
not
feel
like
the
WA
position
was
a
NjobO
or
mandatory
obligation
at
all.
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
connecting
with
other
Writing
Associates,
students,
and
professors
regarding
my
work
for
the
College
Writing
Program
and
felt
that
my
passion
for
writing
was
enhanced
through
my
experience.
Working
with
the
College
Writing
Program
was
an
incredibly
rewarding
experience
for
me.
It
gave
me
a
chance
to
reflect
on
my
own
experiences
as
a
writer
while
I
was
simultaneously
helping
others
with
their
own
writing.
I
enjoyed
being
able
to
recognize
and
evaluate
the
progression
of
the
students
that
I
was
working
with
and
found
it
to
be
incredibly
gratifying.
I
also
realized
that
through
the
readings
for
the
staff
meetings
and
work
with
my
students
I
was
able
to
appreciate
my
own
writing
more
and
watch
it
evolve
as
well.
Overall,
I
believe
that
working
as
a
WA
was
a
very
beneficial
and
productive
experience
for
me
and
for
those
I
worked
with.
I
am
incredibly
enthusiastic
to
have
the
opportunity
to
continue
it
in
my
last
year
at
Lafayette.
