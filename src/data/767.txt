Conversations
The
class
was
bigger
than
I
expected.
At
one
of
our
staff
meetings,
I
had
volunteered
to
talk
to
a
media
and
film
class
about
being
a
WA,
to
encourage
people
to
stop
by
drop-in
hours,
and
when
I
had
volunteered,
I
hadnOt
realized
that
I
would
be
speaking
in
front
of
so
many
students.
IOm
not
saying
that
the
lecture
hall
in
Oeschle
was
completely
filled,
but
there
were
enough
students
there
to
make
me
a
little
nervous,
until
I
reminded
myself
that
all
I
had
to
do
was
talk
about
being
a
WA.
I
loved
being
a
WA,
and
I
didnOt
have
to
make
anything
up
or
say
anything
complicated
and
pretentious.
I
just
had
to
have
a
conversation.
So
I
told
the
class
to
stop
by
drop-in
hours.
I
told
the
class
what
happens
during
a
WA
conference.
I
said
that
WA
conferences
were
conversations
between
a
student
and
a
WA,
designed
to
get
writers
thinking
about
possibilities
for
their
assignments.
Over
the
past
year,
IOve
learned
that
being
a
WA
is
not
about
wielding
a
red
pen,
scribbling
across
a
studentOs
paper,
and
then
watching
the
student
make
the
edits
that
I
have
proposed.
Even
if
the
student
makes
all
of
my
suggested
corrections,
and
the
paper
is
better
as
a
result,
the
student
has
lost
ownership
of
the
paper.
The
student
has
not
discussed
the
paper,
the
hows
and
whys
of
my
suggestions,
and
the
student
is
spared
the
necessity
of
thinking
about
how
to
improve
the
paper,
for
the
student
can
simply
take
my
suggestions
instead.
This
takes
away
the
student
writerOs
agency,
which
I
do
not
want
to
do
as
a
WA.
But
to
return
to
the
day
I
volunteered
in
Oeschle
Hall,
I
talked
to
the
students,
handed
out
a
stack
of
CWP
brochures,
and
then
went
to
my
own
class.
And
that
day,
I
ran
into
a
friend
of
mine
from
sophomore
year.
IOll
call
him
James,
for
the
purposes
of
this
essay.
James
had
been
in
the
class
I
spoke
to
earlier
that
day,
and
he
wanted
to
know
if
I
could
meet
him
and
have
a
WA
conference
about
a
paper
he
was
writing.
I
agreed,
and
I
met
him
in
Skillman
Caf.
I
prefer
to
hold
my
meetings
in
Skillman
Caf,
rather
than
the
CWP
room,
because
I
find
the
atmosphere
less
intimidating,
for
me
and
for
the
student.
Skillman
Caf
is
loud
and
busy,
with
students
drifting
in
and
out,
ordering
coffee,
and
talking
to
their
friends.
This
environment
takes
pressure
off
of
me,
as
a
WA,
as
well
as
the
student
writer,
and
is
more
conducive
to
conversation.
The
student
writer
and
I
are
in
a
familiar
setting
and
we
can
both
relax.
The
CWP
room,
in
contrast,
is
emptier
and
quieter.
I
feel
that
the
CWP
room
invokes
a
classroom
feeling,
which
is
detrimental
to
WA
conferences,
because
the
WAOs
role
is
not
that
of
professor
or
teacher.
WAs
are
not
there
to
lecture
a
student
writer
or
point
out
what
the
student
writer
has
done
incorrectly,
but
rather
to
encourage
the
student
writer
and
discuss
options
and
ideas
for
the
studentOs
work,
without
being
overbearing,
and
always
respecting
the
studentOs
work.
James
and
I
sat
down
at
a
round
table
by
the
glass
windows
separating
the
caf
from
the
library
reception
desk,
and
we
began
our
conference.
JamesO
original
paper
exhibited
strong
ideas
and
organization,
but
lacked
detail.
We
talked
about
how
a
thesis
statement
and
specifics
would
strengthen
the
paper.
James
thought
back
to
the
film
that
he
had
watched
for
class
and
incorporated
certain
scenes
from
the
film,
and
the
feelings
they
evoked,
into
his
paper.
James
was
a
fantastic
student
writer
to
have
in
a
WA
conference,
because
he
asked
questions,
was
receptive
to
advice,
and
was
excited
to
make
changes
that
he
believed
would
strengthen
the
paper.
He
was
vocal
about
what
points
he
wanted
to
make
in
his
paper,
and
he
asked
me
for
suggestions
on
how
to
make
those
points.
Not
all
student
writers
are
as
involved
in
their
WA
conferences
as
James
was.
James
showed
initiative,
seeking
me
out
and
asking
me
if
I
could
meet
with
him,
which
reveals
that
he
was
interested
in
improving
his
paper.
Many
students
are
required
to
come
to
WA
conferences
as
part
of
their
First
Year
Seminar
or
their
VAST,
and
they
do
not
have
any
desire
to
be
at
their
conferences.
Sometimes,
students
believe
that
their
papers
are
already
good,
and
they
do
not
want
to
change
or
improve
them.
Other
times,
studentsO
papers
are
not
even
completed,
and
the
students
have
not
even
thought
about
how
they
want
to
finish
the
assignment.
Once,
instead
of
a
writing
a
five
page
paper,
a
student
submitted
a
paragraph
in
which
he
wrote
something
along
the
lines
of,
NIOm
sorry
I
didnOt
finish
the
paper
:\.O
This
can
be
frustrating
for
the
WA,
but
when
this
happens,
I
try
to
have
conversations
with
the
student
writers.
We
talk
about
what
they
like
about
their
ideas
for
their
papers,
what
could
strengthen
those
ideas,
and,
if
the
paper
is
not
finished,
what
directions
the
student
writers
want
their
papers
to
take.
I
remember
one
WA
conference
I
held
which
almost
turned
into
an
argument
instead
of
a
conversation.
The
student,
whom
IOll
call
Sean,
was
a
member
of
a
VAST
class,
and
was
required
by
the
class
to
meet
with
me.
He
had
written
an
interesting
and
funny
paper,
but
one
that
had
some
flow
problems
and
organizational
flaws.
The
tone
of
the
speaker
changed
throughout
the
paper,
which
led
to
inconsistencies,
and
confused
me
as
a
reader.
I
suggested
several
ways
to
minimize
this
issue,
but
every
time
I
suggested
anything,
Sean
would
refuse
to
consider
it.
This
WA
conference
was
probably
the
most
difficult
one
I
ever
held.
Sean
would
ask
me
questions
about
how
I
would
handle
a
certain
part
of
the
paper,
but
as
soon
as
I
answered
him,
he
would
dismiss
my
advice.
And
this
continued
throughout
the
conference.
Finally,
I
ended
the
conference.
ItOs
difficult
having
a
conversation
with
someone
who
wants
to
make
the
conversation
into
a
fight,
and,
once
a
WA
conference
is
no
longer
a
conversation,
it
is
no
longer
effective.
In
a
conference
like
the
one
I
had
with
Sean,
though,
it
is
important
to
remember
to
keep
composure.
It
was
hard,
especially
because
I
thought
Sean
was
being
inconsiderate,
but
as
WAs,
we
are
representative
of
the
CWP,
and
we
cannot
respond
inappropriately
in
a
conference
like
that
(no
matter
how
much
we
might
want
to!).
And
at
least
Sean
showed
up
for
his
conference.
In
the
last
round
of
conferences
I
held,
half
of
the
students
did
not
come
to
their
meetings.
They
signed
up
for
slots
on
Moodle,
and
then
they
did
not
show
up,
despite
the
fact
that
the
meetings
were
mandatory
and
even
counted
towards
their
final
grade.
I
no
longer
reschedule
missed
meetings,
unless
the
student
gives
me
at
least
a
24
hour
notice,
and
as
long
as
the
new
proposed
meeting
fits
within
the
week
in
which
I
set
up
the
WA
meetings.
Many
times,
it
seems
as
if
students
do
not
take
the
WA
meetings
seriously.
This
can
be
difficult
to
deal
with,
but
I
have
learned
that
instead
of
worrying
about
the
students
who
do
not
show
up,
I
can
focus
my
attention
and
energy
on
the
students
that
do
come
to
meetings,
and
I
can
make
the
most
of
every
single
WA
meeting
I
hold.
One
of
the
most
important
things
IOve
learned
to
keep
in
mind
in
WA
conferences
is
that
the
paper
is
the
studentOs,
not
mine.
I
make
sure
that
the
student
has
a
copy
of
the
paper
in
front
of
them,
and
that
the
student
has
a
pen
or
pencil
in
her
hand
so
she
can
make
corrections
to
the
paper,
not
me.
I
try
to
encourage
the
student
to
write
what
she
wants
to
say,
not
what
she
thinks
the
professor
wants
her
to
say.
If
the
student
is
struggling
with
syntax
or
grammar,
I
ask
the
student
to
read
the
portion
causing
difficulty
out
loud.
After
reading
a
sentence
or
two
out
loud,
student
writers
can
often
discover
their
errors
without
me
drawing
attention
to
them.
When
I
write
papers
for
my
various
classes,
I
find
that
the
techniques
I
use
in
WA
conferences
impact
my
own
writing.
When
I
am
struggling
with
a
passage,
and
I
canOt
think
of
the
right
way
to
express
an
idea,
I
pretend
that
I
am
talking
to
my
friend,
trying
to
explain
verbally
what
I
am
attempting
to
put
on
the
page.
I
want
my
writing
to
sound
conversational,
not
stiff,
and
I
accomplish
this
by
reading
my
papers
out
loud.
I
also
employ
this
technique
when
I
encounter
technical
language
in
articles.
I
read
the
sections
of
the
articles
in
which
this
language
occurs
until
I
believe
I
understand
what
I
have
read
enough
to
explain
it
to
someone
else.
If
I
do
not
understand
what
I
am
reading,
the
reader
of
my
paper
will
not
understand
what
I
have
written.
James
texted
me
a
few
days
after
our
WA
conference.
He
thanked
me
for
my
help
and
told
me
that
his
professor
loved
the
paper
he
turned
in.
And
when
James
texted
me
that,
I
smiled,
because,
yes,
lots
of
students
donOt
show
up,
and
some
of
the
students
who
do
show
up
donOt
seem
interested
in
improving
their
work,
but
I
also
I
get
to
work
with
people
like
James,
and
that
is
why
I
love
being
a
WA.
