New
WA
Literary
Narrative
Project
for
Workshop
Fall
2001
Taking
time
out
of
summer
vacation
to
draft
this
literary
narrative
provides
a
strange
kind
of
irony:
trying
to
write
a
meaningful
paper
about
meaningful
experiences,
at
a
decidedly
meaningless
time.
Lost
among
the
beach
sand
and
sunscreen
that
has
taken
up
temporary
residency
in
my
brain
are
years
worth
of
papers,
poems,
and
stories,
not
to
mention
teachers,
professors,
and
classmates.
I
know
that
the
stories
are
there,
in
my
mind,
but
rehashing
all
of
my
old
writing
experiences
does
not
really
seem
to
be
the
point
of
this
assignment,
and,
in
addition,
seems
overly
self-righteous.
My
journey
as
a
writer
is
not
something
that
should
be
documented,
especially
because
I
do
not
consider
myself
to
be
a
great
writer
(although
I
am
always
working
to
get
better).
What
I
do
know
is
that
I
enjoy
writing,
particularly
when
I
can
adequately
express
my
feelings.
So
here
goes.
Earnest
Hemingway
I
am
not,
but
I
can
say,
with
certainty,
that
I
am
a
much
better
writer
now
than
I
was
in
Kindergarten.
And
doesn't
that
count
for
something?
The
opportunity
to
express
individual
emotion
is
what
attracted
me
to
writing
in
my
earliest
school
years.
The
first
thing
I
can
remember
about
writing
is
that
it
gave
me
the
chance
to
do
what
science
experiments
and
math
problems
never
did:
self-
expression.
This
is
certainly
not
the
case
for
all
people
-
I'm
sure
that
the
young
Albert
Einstein
felt
as
individually
passionate
about
science
as
I
felt
about
writing
-
so
for
me,
writing
opened
up
the
doors
that
allowed
me
to
show
part
of
myself
In
writing,
my
opinions
and
thoughts
mattered;
I
never
felt
that
same
way
about
another
subject.
Strangely
enough,
though,
my
first
specific
memory
of
writing
comes
from
early
elementary
school,
and
it
is
strange
because
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
self-expression.
Learning
to
write
in
cursive
is
my
earliest
writing
memory.
The
paper
was
off-white,
and
the
blue
lines
were
spaced
wide
apart
with
a
dotted
red
line
in
the
middle.
I
had
to
seriously
concentrate
in
order
to
avoid
writing
off
of
the
lines.
It
felt
very
mechanical:
each
student
in
the
class
had
to
try
their
best
to
mimic
the
"perfect"
cursive
examples
that
were
on
a
chart,
A
through
Z,
above
the
chalkboard.
There
was
nothing
personal
about
that
process.
Your
grade
depended
not
on
how
well
your
writing
looked
like
everyone
else's.
Obviously,
this
is
the
opposite
of
what
appeals
to
me
about
the
writing
process.
But
learning
to
write
in
cursive
was
a
stepping-stone
to
more
personal
experiences.
Soon
after,
in
3rd
grade,
I
was
introduced
to
the
wonderful
world
of
Current
Events.
Current
Events
was
an
opportunity
for
each
student
in
the
class,
once
a
week,
to
write
their
own
feelings
and
interpretations
about
something
newsworthy,
and
orally
present
it
to
the
class.
This
was
a
revelation
to
me:
first,
because
I
had
the
liberty
to
choose
whatever
I
wanted
to
choose
as
my
current
event;
and
second,
because
I
would
be
allowed
to
share
my
own
thoughts
with
everyone.
Not
simply
the
teacher,
or
my
parents,
or
even
one
other
student
reviewer.
Current
Events
was
the
first
time
that
I
could
remember
having
a
whole
audience
of
people
that
would
listen
to
what
I
had
to
say.
The
one
Current
Event
that
sticks
out
in
my
mind
was
the
1989
San
Francisco
earthquake.
It
was
a
big
news
story
and
it
had
to
do
with
baseball.
Being
a
sports
fanatic,
it
was
an
easy
Current
Event
to
choose.
But
what
I
remember
most
about
my
presentation
that
day
was
the
reaction
of
my
teacher,
Mrs.
Radice.
She
told
me
afterward
that
it
was
the
kind
of
story
I
picked
that
made
the
difference
between
good
and
bad,
as
it
was
the
way
I
told
it.
I
realized
at
that
time
that
all
writing
has
the
chance
to
be
exciting;
it
doesn't
take
an
earthquake
to
create
a
captivating
narrative.
In
elementary
school,
I
also
first
encountered
personal
journals.
In
3rd
and
4th
grade,
they
were
required
writing,
and
occasionally,
a
student
would
be
allowed
to
read
aloud
from
their
journal
to
the
class.
I
still
have
my
3rd
and
4th
grade
journals,
and
believe
it
or
not,
I
still
read
from
them
every
so
often.
In
them,
my
writing
is
much
less
refined
than
it
is
now,
but
I
still
speak
with
many
of
the
same
opinions,
and
in
the
same
tone
of
voice.
Most
of
the
journal
stories
have
to
do
with
Little
League
baseball
or
whatever
homework
I
had
that
night,
but
the
occasional
crisis,
be
it
familial
or
friendly,
is
included.
In
hindsight,
I
learned
as
much
about
myself
while
writing
those
journals
as
I
have
in
anything
I've
written
since.
That
idea
somewhat
scares
me.
Since
that
time,
I
have
tried
to
re-capture
that
kind
of
self-exploration,
as
juvenile
as
it
was,
by
starting
up
two
other
journals
(one
in
high
school
and
one
in
college).
I
stopped
writing
in
both
of
them,
however:
it
has
never
felt
the
same
as
it
did
in
3rd
grade.
As
a
result,
I
know
that
I
still
have
to
achieve
significant
growth
as
a
writer.
My
writing
style,
as
anyone
reading
than
tell,
is
conversationally
inclined,
personal,
and
passive.
Comfort
writing
is
what
I
do
best,
but
I
didn't
know
how
to
use
it
to
my
advantage
until
7th
grade.
My
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Smithers,
is
the
mother
of
one
of
my
best
friends.
As
a
result,
there
was
really
no
awkward
adjusting
period
with
her
as
my
teacher.
My
writing,
instead
of
excelling
in
a
comfortable
atmosphere,
periodically
suffered
as
I
felt
no
need
to
impress
a
friend's
mom
in
the
same
way
that
I
had
to
impress
a
teacher
I
was
totally
unfamiliar
with.
In
that
respect,
Mrs.
Smithers
taught
me
to
never
expect
that
the
reader
will
always
understand
exactly
what
you
are
trying
to
communicate
to
them.
Her
mantra
sticks
with
me
to
this
day:
"tell
'em
what
you
plan
on
telling
'em,
then
tell
'em,
then
tell
'em
what
you
told
'em."
Writing,
she
explained,
could
be
personal,
but
it
had
to
stick
to
task
and
it
had
to
connect
to
the
reader.
The
challenge,
then,
was
to
blend
my
style
of
writing
with
a
style
that
would
allow
me
to
achieve
academic
success.
The
first
real
challenging
writing
assignment
that
I
can
remember
having
to
do
was
in
8th
grade,
and
it
was
called
the
"I-Search"
paper.
I-Search
was
the
first
thing
resembling
a
term
paper
that
I
ever
had
to
do.
I
remember
thinking
that,
when
the
teacher,
Mrs.
Wilde,
assigned
I-Search,
and
told
us
that
it
was
to
be
8-10
pages
long,
I
almost
fell
out
of
my
desk.
I
had
never
done
any
paper
longer
than
3
pages,
and
certainly
never
had
to
write
in
any
kind
of
a
serious
manner
for
more
than
a
page
or
two,
most
likely
during
essay
exams.
In
other
words,
the
I-Search
paper
was
a
wake-up
call
to
me
-
a
reminder
that
writing
could
be
fun,
but
had
to
be
refined
and
serious
also.
Mrs.
Wilde
let
us
choose
any
topic
in
the
world,
as
long
as
it
had
a
central
thesis
that
was
broad
enough
to
cover
10
pages
of
writing.
That
alone
was
progression
in
writing
for
me:
even
though
it
was
a
broad
topic,
having
to
answer
to
a
thesis
statement
was
a
new
idea
for
me,
but
something
that
I
would
get
plenty
of
work
at
in
the
future.
Another
thing
about
the
I-Search
paper
that
makes
it
stand
out
in
my
mind
is
the
old
word
processor
that
I
typed
it
on.
The
letters
were
very
big,
the
printing
was
child-like,
and
it
made
it
very
easy
to
type
10
pages,
even
though
the
length
of
the
paper
intimidated
me
at
first.
But
as
an
ancient
word
processing
program,
it
was
more
sophisticated
than
the
typewriters
that
I
typed
on
in
elementary
school,
before
computers
were
affordable
and
in
widespread
use.
The
I-Search
paper,
though,
serves
as
an
effective
reminder
of
how
easy
it
has
been
for
my
generation
to
adapt
to
changing
technologies.
Everything
from
typing
papers,
writing
reports,
and
even
keeping
journals
can
all
be
done
electronically
now,
and
not
just
on
computers.
I
have
used
laptop
(and
even
handheld)
devices,
all
of
which
have
items
such
as
spell-check
and
a
built-in
thesaurus.
In
other
words,
as
a
student
today,
expression
is
not
hard
work;
it
is
not
complicated
or
time-consuming
to
physically
get
ideas
down
onto
paper,
whereas
that
used
to
be
half
of
the
challenge.
This
WA
paper
serves
as
a
perfect
example
-
all
I
had
to
do
was
save
my
ideas
onto
a
disk,
and
they
would
remain
there,
in
spell-checked
perfection,
for
eternity.
And
eternity
is
how
long
it
will
probably
take
for
me
to
learn
to
type
with
perfect
grammar.
One
of
the
first
lessons
I
learned
in
high
school?
How
to
write
active
sentences,
instead
of
passive
ones.
As
any
trained
eye
can
tell
by
reading
this
paper,
no
matter
how
many
times
a
teacher
has
reminded
me
of
this,
I
simply
cannot
understand
the
difference.
To
be
completely
honest,
I
still
do
not
know
the
difference,
even
though
every
single
English
teach
that
I
had
in
high
school
attempted
to
teach
me
and
break
my
habit.
Obviously,
I
do
not
desire
to
launch
into
an
English
lesson
at
this
point
in
order
to
explain
how
I
can
correct
the
problem
or
what
the
difference
is
between
active
and
passive
(even
though
I
own
several
books
that
could
help
me
to
do
that).
In
fact,
once
I
did
learn
the
difference,
I
continued
to
go
back
to
passive
thoughts.
One
of
the
lessons
I
am
learning
in
college
is
that
expression
is
different
for
each
person.
While
grammatically,
some
people
may
be
more
correct
than
others
(and
not
to
underscore
the
importance
of
have
an
educationally-sound
foundation),
I
think
that
the
most
important
part
of
writing
is
articulating
yourself
accurately,
and
not
necessarily
in
letter-perfect
English.
Over
the
course
of
four
years
in
high
school,
I
probably
did
more
work
for
English
classes
than
for
any
other
class.
As
English
classes
go,
every
high
school
has
that
one
English
teacher
-
the
one
that
everyone
whispers
about
in
the
hallways,
the
one
who
has
seemingly
been
teaching
forever,
the
legendary
nightmare.
That
teacher
in
my
high
school
is
a
lady
named
Pat
Job.
Ms.
Job
(pronounced
jobe,
like
the
book
in
the
Bible)
was
my
English
teacher
for
my
junior
and
senior
years
of
high
school.
She
is
also
the
lady
responsible
for
vastly
improving
my
writing
and
thinking
processes.
From
Day
1
in
her
class,
she
urged
her
pupils
to
enter
into
"the
rarified
air
of
cognitive
thinking."
In
Ms.
Job's
class,
it
wasn't
enough
to
simply
answer
a
question.
The
answer
was
only
the
short
beginning
to
a
process
that
usually
brought
about
exhausting
but
brilliant
papers.
When
Ms.
Job
gave
her
students
an
essay
prompt,
a
student's
initial
answer
was
never
enough.
Of
course,
that
does
not
seem
like
anything
too
difficult.
However,
with
Ms.
Job,
the
2nd
and
3rd
and
4th
answers
were
also
usually
not
enough.
Ms.
Job
taught
students
to
build
and
build
and
build,
to
expand
and
deepen
thoughts
to
regions
outside
the
box
that
most
students
(especially
myself)
never
thought
they
could
reach.
Writing,
in
Ms.
Job's
class,
was
not
a
job,
an
activity,
or
even
a
hobby.
It
was
a
process;
a
project
with
a
beginning
and
an
end
that
were
very
far
apart.
The
process
was
not
always
fun.
Upon
reflection,
in
fact,
it
was
almost
never
fun.
I
constantly
found
myself
asking,
"how
much
more
does
she
want
me
to
write..
.and
what
the
hell
else
could
I
possibly
have
to
say?"
But
Ms.
Job's
lesson
is
invaluable:
there
is
never
an
end
to
a
thought.
Expressions
in
writing,
for
a
term
paper
or
even
something
much
shorter,
never
have
to
have
a
bottom
or
a
conclusion.
Ever
since
her
class,
writing
papers
is
more
humbling,
because
you
know
that
you
could
always
be
wrong
in
the
eyes
of
a
teacher
or
professor
who
can
reach
a
level
that
you
cannot.
On
the
other
hand,
though,
writing
is
more
exhilarating,
because
I
just
may
be
able
to
reach
a
level
that
no
one
else
has
been
able
to.
As
a
result
of
the
lessons
I
learned
in
writing,
and
especially
as
a
result
of
Ms.
Job's
class,
I
was
more
than
prepared
for
writing
in
college.
Frankly,
in
my
FYS
at
Lafayette,
I
was
able
to
write
and
express
my
thoughts
much
better
than
most
of
my
classmates.
The
ease
with
which
I
took
to
college-level
writing
certainly
surprised
me.
However,
I
can
only
attribute
that
to
all
of
the
writing
lessons
I
took
away
from
growing
up
as
a
kid
who
loved
to
put
his
ideas
down
on
paper.
And
the
process
never
stops.
The
WA
program
will
expose
me
to
the
expressions
of
dozens
of
other
students,
each
one
with
something
valuable
for
me
to
walk
away
with.
As
for
this
paper,
it
too
achieved
something:
the
beach
sand
is
all
gone
from
my
brain,
and
I
am
ready
for
another
semester
of
writing
at
Lafayette.
