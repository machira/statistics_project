My
Research
Paper
Autobiography
While
I
have
been
thoughtful
enough
to
collect
and
save
most
if
not
all
of
the
writing
assignments
I
have
ever
done,
I
could
not
recall
but
few
of
the
works
in
detail.
This
initially
disappointed
me,
and
I
began
to
categorize
this
assignment,
constructing
a
narrative
of
my
growth
in
literacy,
as
a
research
paper.
Unfortunately,
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
first
research
information
on
the
memory
because
I
was
not
able
to
begin
writing
history
as
a
writer
without
rummaging
through
my
elementary
school
files.
Much
to
my
surprise,
though,
I
not
only
discovered
a
great
change
in
my
style
of
writing
over
the
years,
but
I
also
found
my
very
first
piece
of
writing--
a
fully
illustrated
book.
My
elementary
school,
Wenonah
Elementary
School,
taught
students
in
grades
kindergarten
through
sixth.
It
had
a
program
entitled
ACE
(Activity
Creates
Energy)
for
gifted
students
in
grades
third
through
sixth
only.
Both
my
older
sister,
Julie,
and
my
older
brother,
Brett,
were
invited
to
participate
in
ACE
when
they
had
entered
the
third
grade,
and
I
wanted
very
much
to
have
the
invitation
extended
to
me
as
well.
Happily,
it
was.
The
program's
most
renowned
and
enjoyable
assignment
was
to
have
its
students
write
and
illustrate
original
storybooks.
Drafts
were
required,
but
when
they
were
completed
and
reviewed
by
the
teacher,
Mrs.
Arbo,
she
gave
the
student
pages
of
white
construction
paper
bound
like
a
book
by
her
hand
sewn
stitches.
The
story
was
already
neatly
recorded
in
it,
in
pencil,
so
that
the
student
could
enjoy
tracing
the
words
with
the
crayola
colors
of
his
choice.
Mrs.
Arbo
also
reserved
plenty
of
space
for
illustrations.
Illustrating
was
my
favorite
part.
I
re-read
my
first
story
prior
to
writing
this
paragraph.
I
now
realize
that
I
had
a
unique
talent
for
writing
about
passionate
love
affairs
even
at
the
young
age
of
seven
(a
talent
that
has
since
been
in
remission).
The
story,
entitled
The
Log
Talkers
Family.
was
about
a
talking
male
log
who
sought
companionship
from
a
female
log.
She
was
gifted
with
the
ability
to
speak
also.
After
one
dinner
date
to
the
Ground
Round,
the
two
logs
wed,
built
a
house,
gave
birth
to
a
baby
log,
and,
not
surprisingly,
they
lived
happily
ever
after.
The
plot
of
my
second
childhood
master
piece
was
slightly
less
traditional.
It
was
about
a
Tyrannosaurous
Rex
with
bad
breath,
and
thus
its
title,
The
B.B.
(Bad
Breath)
Planet.
I
was
a
seven
year
old
challenging
the
popular
scientific
theory
of
what
caused
the
extinction
of
the
dinosaurs.
In
The
B.B.
Planet.
I
proposed
that
dinosaur
extinction
was
not
a
result
of
a
meteor
striking
and
unsettling
the
earth
which
subsequently
blocked
all
sunlight
and
prevented
plant
reproduction.
My
hypothesis
was
that
the
breath
of
the
T-Rex
was
so
foul
that
it
actually
caused
his
contemporaries
to
drop
dead.
Surprisingly,
my
theory
is
yet
to
acquire
the
support
of
established
scientists.
Fifth
grade
was
my
first
formal
encounter
with
non-fiction.
Of
course
my
concept
of
non-fiction
was
limited
to
the
books
I
read
from
the
non-fiction
section
of
the
library,
but
the
phrase
actually
became
synonymous
with
term
paper
that
year.
I
vividly
remember
dreading
that
infamous
writing
assignment.
My
teacher,
Mrs.
Meyers,
insisted
on
the
students'
research
being
recorded
onto
3'
by
5'
note
cards.
Each
card
contained
the
following:
one
fact
about
the
general
topic,
the
book,
author,
and
page
number
from
which
that
fact
was
taken,
and
a
word
or
phrase
indicating
the
fact's
specific
topic.
When
the
research
was
completed,
the
cards
were
separated
by
their
various
topics,
and
these
topics
became
the
major
headings
of
the
student's
formal
outline.
The
outline
actually
counted
as
a
separate
grade,
and
it
had
to
be
reviewed
by
Mrs.
Meyers
for
organization.
Only
then
could
the
student
construct
the
draft
and
create
the
finished
paper.
I
remember
that
as
a
high
school
student,
I
was
glad
that
the
standard
book
report
was
no
longer
assigned
and
that
ninth
grade
English
and
history
classes
required
a
good
variety
of
written
work.
The
one
that
I
recall
most
vividly
is
the
autobiography
I
wrote
during
my
freshmen
year.
My
autobiography
was
entitled
All
About
Me
r
and
make
no
mistake,
it
was
all
about
me.
Rereading
this
paper
caused
me
to
question
the
curriculum.
It
made
me
wonder
why
my
teacher,
Mrs.
McGronigle,
or
any
other
teacher
would
assign
this
task
to
ninth
graders.
In
Mrs.
McGronigle's
circumstance,
she
graded
ten
pages
each
times
thirty
kids
worth
of
I
was
born
on
such
and
such
a
date,
I
started
little
league
in
kindergarten,
and
I
got
a
Barbie
for
Christmas
in
1981,
ETC...
I
know
that
my
life
story
was
only
as
interesting
as
Becky's,
Jaclin's,
Dan's,
and
every
other
one
of
my
14
year
old
classmates,
so
how
did
Mrs.
McGronigle
decide
who
got
an
A?
Mrs.
McGronigle
awarded
me
an
A
for
my
effort.
She
also
commented
that
it
was
an
excellent
paper.
Because
my
paper
contained
no
organizational,
grammatical,
or
typographical
errors
and
had
no
spelling
mistakes,
there
were
no
deductions
for
these
kinds
of
errors.
But
I
wonder,
is
that
why
my
paper
was
excellent?
I
would
like
to
know
exactly
how
important
my
story
was
to
Mrs.
McGronigle.
Of
course
I
am
unable
to
obtain
that
answer
and
therefore
have
concluded
that
writing,
at
the
freshmen
level,
was
merely
an
exercise
to
learn
to
minimize
if
not
eliminate
the
types
of
errors
I
described.
As
I
got
older,
I
was
finally
able
to
test
my
talents
with
creative
writing.
I
did
a
tremendous
amount
of
writing
for
John
Howard,
my
junior
and
senior
year
English
teacher.
While
as
a
junior,
the
focus
was
English
Literature,
and
I
and
my
classmates
were
required
to
write
several
researched
criticisms,
we
were
given
creative
writing
options
for
a
few
of
the
assignments
such
as
the
one
given
at
the
conclusion
of
reading
Gulliver's
Travels--
write
a
fictional
account
of
Gulliver's
travels
to
our
high
school.
My
high
school,
like
all
high
schools,
was
and
is
still
overflowing
with
strange
students
and
administrators.
I
used
this,
coupled
with
my
naturally
cynical
point
of
view
to
give
my
paper
a
cutting
edge.
Mr.
Howard
made
it
no
secret
which
of
his
contemporaries
he
liked,
and
of
course,
which
he
did
not.
It
was
blatantly
obvious
who
Mr.
Howard
liked
most
to
torment.
The
unlucky
man,
or
munchkin
as
Mr.
Howard
would
have
one
believe
was
Mr.
Ryan.
It
is
obvious
from
Mr.
Ryan's
appearance
where
this
nickname
munchkin
was
derived.
He
is
very
vertically
challenged
measuring
in
at
5'2."
Another
of
his
unique
characteristics
that
Mr.
Howard
loved
to
make
known
was
his
ability
to
annually
rank
high
among
Cosmo's
worse
dressed
list.
I
humored
Mr.
Howard
by
using
his
dislike
for
this
man
by
including
him
amongst
Gulliver's
many
strange
acquaintances.
Mr.
Howard
was
amused
and
awarded
me
an
A
for
the
paper.
But
I
later
learned
that
he
accidentally
left
a
copy
in
the
teachers
lounge--
Mr.
Ryan
told
me
that
himself.
Ever
since,
I
have
refrained
from
criticizing
my
respected
elders,
and
I
have
opted
to
write
the
researched
criticisms.
College
was
a
very
new
experience
for
me.
I
entered
as
a
Biology
major
and
have
since
switched
to
English,
which
I
am
very
much
enjoying.
But,
as
I
quote
from
this
paper's
assignment,
my
first
year
writing
seminar
was
like
a
bucket
of
cold
water
thrown
in
my
face.
Prior
to
college,
I
was
an
honors
student
who
earned
an
A
in
every
English
class
I
had
ever
taken.
I
thought
I
was
a
good
writer
because
I
was
organized,
logical,
and
used
good
grammar.
My
FYS,
however,
was
like
a
philosophy
course
and
instructed
by
a
philosophy
professor.
I
had
never
philosophized
in
my
life
so
one
can
just
imagine
my
confusion.
The
topic
of
the
class,
entitled
Abortion:
the
Morality
and
Law,
did
not
make
it
any
easier.
I
recall
the
infinite
questions
concerning
such
a
controversial
issue
and
the
endless
debates.
When
does
a
fetus
become
a
person?
When
is
it
too
late
to
get
an
abortion?
Who
decides
the
answers
to
these
questions?
I
really
did
wonder,
When
is
the
professor
going
to
tell
us
the
answer?"
Needless
to
say,
there
were
no
answers,
and
when
it
came
time
to
decide
the
best
possible
way
to
resolve
an
issue,
I
did
not
accept
that.
Rather
than
discussing
the
topic
as
thoroughly
as
I
could,
I
proposed
simple,
black
and
white
solutions
for
each
as
if
it
really
was
that
easy.
I
earned
a
B
in
the
course.
First
year
writing
was
a
better
and
a
wonderful
experience.
It
ultimately
led
me
to
become
an
English
major.
Like
FYS,
the
focus
of
the
writing
was
not
on
grammar
but
rather
on
what
I
was
thinking,
how
well
I
analyzed
the
subjects
discussed,
and
how
well
I
could
convey
the
points
I
wanted
to
make
to
my
reader.
I
was
better
though.
I
was
ready
for
the
freedom
of
having
my
own
opinion
and
was
confident
that
I
would
not
be
penalized
for
my
opinion
but
rather
for
the
mistakes
I
made
in
the
clarity
and
logic
of
my
thinking--
regardless
of
whether
or
not
my
professor
agreed
with
me.
I
earned
an
A
in
the
course.
Reviewing
my
history
as
a
writer
has
actually
been
an
eye
opening
experience.
The
first
thing
that
I
realized
was
that
this
paper
was
not
at
all
a
research
paper
like
my
fifth
grade
term
paper.
This
paper
was
much
more
like
my
freshman
autobiography
such
that
I
was
able
to
tell
a
story
about
myself.
The
difference
this
time,
however,
is
that
the
story
itself
was
the
most
important
part.
Without
it,
I
probably
would
not
have
seen
the
changes
that
have
occurred
in
my
writing.
My
second
realization
is
that
through
analyzing
my
story,
I
have
seen
a
drastic
change
in
both
the
style
of
my
writing
and
the
way
I
understand
what
writing
entails.
I
no
longer
write
fictitious
fairytales.
I
no
longer
strictly
report
what
has
already
been
said
by
others.
I
challenge
things
now.
I
analyze.
I'm
embarrassed
to
admit,
but
I
will,
that
I
never
knew
that
I
could
ask
questions
within
the
body
of
a
paper.
If
I
was
to
do
that,
my
thinking
was
surely
I
will
be
forced
to
answer
this.
But
now
I
know
that
I
can
attempt
to
answer
the
question,
or
I
can
leave
the
question
alone.
The
last
thing
that
I
noticed
is
that
I
have
not
earned
an
A
in
every
single
English
class
that
I
have
ever
taken.
I
once
thought
that
I
would.
