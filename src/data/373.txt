Writing
As
a
WA:
History
in
the
Making
Looking
back
at
the
last
year,
full
of
many
writing
situations,
both
in
and
out
of
the
classroom,
I
am
beginning
to
piece
together
the
characteristics
that
make
up
my
identity
as
a
writer.
It
is
becoming
very
clear
to
me
how
important
this
identity
is,
especially
as
a
Writing
Associate.
As
WAs,
our
main
goal
is
to
approach
individuals
as
writers,
each
with
a
unique
history
and
identity.
Sometimes
this
identity
is
very
evident
but
more
often,
similar
to
myself,
it
is
still
slowing
emerging.
Personally,
I
know
that
in
this
upcoming
year,
I
hope
to
employ
this
idea
of
"writers
with
identities"
in
my
student
conferences.
And
I
think
I
will
better
accomplish
this
goal
the
more
I
understand
myself
as
a
writer.
Basically,
I
write
a
lot.
I
am
always
writing.
I
will
probably
always
be
writing.
But
that's
okay
because
the
fact
is
that
I
love
writing.
I
love
being
able
to
express
myself
in
words
on
a
piece
of
paper,
turning
complex
images
and
thoughts
from
my
mind
into
fragmented
letters,
unscrambled
into
words,
strung
together
into
sentences,
and
placed
into
some
intricate
pattern
of
paragraph
structure
and
organization
that
doesn't
fully
reveal
itself
until
the
last
period
is
in
place.
Writing
first
became
fun
for
me
when
I
learned
that
there
were
actually
rules
to
be
followed.
I
became
good
at
following
the
rules
and
my
writing
fit
very
neatly
into
the
"guidelines
for
proper
writing
etiquette,"
if
there
is
such
a
thing.
Recently,
writing
has
been
fun
because
I've
been
experimenting
with
new
ways
of
breaking
the
rules.
I
should
probably
clarify,
however,
because
breaking
the
rules
is
not
easy
for
me.
I
don't
like
to
break
the
rules.
I
like
things
neat
and
clean
and
orderly,
but
I
also
don't
want
to
be
boring
or
limited
or
afraid
of
stretching
my
wings
into
uncharted
territory.
This
being
said,
I've
been
trying
to
figure
out
what
my
writing
style
is.
What
is
my
identity
as
a
writer?
Is
there
supposed
to
be
some
rehearsed
answer
that
roles
off
my
tongue?
"Hi,
My
name
is
and
I'm
a_writer."
It
reminds
me
of
a
pompous
interview
question
in
the
education
field,
"What
is
your
philosophy
of
teaching?"
It
has
a
nice
ring
to
it,
"What
is
your
identity
as
a
writer?"
But
joking
and
sarcasm
aside,
I
do
think
it
is
a
good
question.
It's
a
question
that
I
haven't
given
too
much
thought
until
lately,
and
I
am
still
only
at
the
beginning
stages
of
investigating.
Here
is
what
I've
thought
of
so
far:
I
like
to
outline.
I
don't
need
a
formal
sentence
outline
with
proper
notation,
but
when
necessary
I
make
a
damn
good
one.
(I
just
followed
Mark
Twain's
rule
of
thumb
by
substituting
"damn"
for
"very."
I
guess
the
editor
will
probably
take
it
out.)
I
usually
just
scribble
my
outline
or
notes
down
on
pieces
of
scrap
paper.
It
is
usually
nothing
very
exciting,
but
it
gets
my
ideas
flowing
and
somewhat
organized.
I
can't
spell.
I
rely
on
my
dictionary
and
spell
check
constantly.
I'm
a
careless
typist
who
types
faster
than
her
ability
allows.
My
finicky
spacebar
is
no
help
in
this
matter.
Nonetheless,
I
do
all
of
my
composing
on
the
computer.
Often
my
ideas
come
so
fast
that
I
just
type.
Random
thoughts,
sentence
fragments,
and
misplaced
ideas
often
fill
my
computer
screen
so
that
I
get
them
down
before
I
lose
them.
Then
I
go
back
and
cut
and
paste,
rearrange,
and
fill
in
the
gaps.
Sometimes
I
just
stare
at
the
screen
blankly,
talking
to
it.
I
always
talk
out
loud
when
I
type
if
I'm
alone.
I
much
prefer
to
write
alone.
I
never
hand
in
something
to
be
read
unless
I
think
its
good,
or
at
least
cleaned
up.
I
might
not
like
what
it
says,
but
at
least
it
looks
good.
Not
that
I
never
make
a
careless
mistake,
but
I
strive,
at
least,
for
the
appearance
of
professionalism.
The
aforementioned
are
some
characteristics
that
I
have
pinpointed
about
my
writing
process.
Reflecting
on
the
different
types
of
conferences
I've
had
in
the
past
year
reminds
me
that
each
writer
has
his
or
her
own
process.
It
is
important
to
remember
this
principle
when
approaching
writing
conferences.
Since
everyone
writes
in
different
styles,
not
every
student
comes
to
the
conference
at
the
same
stage.
While
I
like
to
present
my
WA
with
what
I
consider
my
best
draft
possible,
not
every
student
works
this
way
or
would
even
benefit
from
attempting
to.
For
example,
many
students
have
come
to
conferences
with
no
more
than
a
thesis,
an
outline,
an
introduction,
or
some
ides
to
toss
around.
These
have
the
potential
to
be
some
of
the
best
conferences
because
the
students
are
eager
to
dialogue
about
their
ideas
and
get
very
excited
when
the
ideas
start
to
fit
together.
(The
lack
of
a
draft
could
also
indicate
a
lazy
or
disinterest
student,
however.)
A
particular
student
stands
out
in
my
mind
from
the
fall
semester
of
last
year.
She
came
to
all
four
meetings
with
little
to
no
draft
of
a
paper
but
with
great
ideas
to
discuss.
She
left
every
time
with
most
of
her
paper
mapped
out
in
her
mind
and
on
paper,
and
we
had
a
great
time
really
getting
into
her
paper.
She
was
one
of
few
students
to
receive
an
A
in
that
class
which
reinforces
the
point
that
each
student
has
his
or
her
own
writing
process.
I
could
never
have
gone
to
a
conference
without
a
draft
and
then
gone
home
to
write
an
A
paper
in
a
night
or
two,
but
it
worked
for
her.
The
point
is
to
be
flexible
in
the
conferences;
they
cannot
all
be
approached
in
the
same
way.
It
is
important
to
find
out
how
the
student
works
and
what
he
or
she
is
expecting
to
get
out
of
it.
In
addition
to
discovering
characteristics
of
my
writing
process,
the
different
writing
experiences
I've
had
in
classes
at
Lafayette
in
the
last
year
have
also
significantly
contributed
to
my
developing
"Identity."
Although
it
may
sound
obvious,
I
like
to
write
about
something
in
which
I'm
interested.
I
guess
I've
known
this
for
a
long
time,
but
certain
classes
in
my
last
semester
definitely
proved
this
point
in
my
mind.
In
my
VAST
class
about
violence
in
the
media,
we
were
given
the
assignment
of
writing
one
twenty-five-page
paper.
We
had
complete
freedom
in
topic
and
had
the
whole
semester
to
work
on
it.
While
intimidating
at
first,
the
assignment
soon
became
exhilarating.
I
was
eager
to
decide
on
a
topic,
one
that
would
be
important
to
me
and
worth
devoting
an
entire
semester
to.
It
soon
became
clear
to
me
that
I
wanted
to
write
something
about
violence
against
women
and
the
way
in
which
the
media
portrays
this
type
of
violence.
As
a
woman
and
as
a
person
who
stands
the
risk
of
being
victimized
by
violence
and
demoralized
by
glorified
and
glamorized
violence
in
the
media,
it
became
a
personal
topic
for
me.
Writing
about
something
personal
or
at
least
interesting
to
me
always
makes
a
difference.
The
writing
then
becomes
an
extension
of
me,
part
of
me,
something
in
which
I
believe.
Whenever
possible
I
try
to
make
my
writing
a
reflection
of
me
in
some
way.
As
WAs,
we
have
the
potential
to
show
fellow
writers
avenues
for
making
their
writing
more
personal
to
them.
Depending
on
the
assignment,
it
may
not
be
easily
accomplished,
but
the
more
freedom
given
by
the
professors,
the
more
opportunity
for
self-expression.
Being
excited
about
my
paper,
however,
was
not
enough
to
get
it
written.
I
had
to
take
steps
to
break
the
intimidating
task
into
more
manageable
pieces.
I
began
by
researching
my
topic.
I
needed
a
lot
of
information,
enough
to
fill
twenty-five
pages,
but
not
too
much
as
to
avoid
only
skimming
the
surface.
I
wanted
to
make
a
point,
a
strong
point,
and
I
wanted
to
have
concrete
evidence.
Although
at
this
time,
I
wasn't
even
sure
was
my
point
would
be!
As
I
began
gathering
information,
I
tried
to
find
some
direction
for
my
paper.
It
was
hard
to
make
everything
fit
together
because
there
was
so
much.
Here
is
where
a
valuable
lesson
from
my
Excel
research
proved
useful.
I
have
been
assisting
a
History
professor
with
the
early
stages
on
a
book
on
World
War
II.
He
keeps
reminding
me
that
this
stage
is
very
important
but
much
of
the
research
we
are
doing
won't
necessarily
make
it
in
the
book.
You
can't
use
everything
but
you
need
to
find
out
what's
available
before
you
can
decide
what's
good.
This
principle
was
certainly
true
with
my
VAST
paper.
Once
I
had
gathered
a
substantial
amount
of
research,
I
began
putting
everything
together
in
an
outline.
What
started
off
as
a
few
scribbles
on
a
piece
of
scrap
paper,
turned
into
an
extensive
seven-page
outline.
After
several
revisions
in
the
outline,
the
paper
was
almost
completely
laid
out
for
me,
and
all
I
had
to
do
was
fill
in
some
holes.
By
this
time
I
thought
I
knew
what
my
thesis
was,
but
it
wasn't
until
meeting
with
my
WA
that
I
really
nailed
it
down.
One
of
the
first
questions
I
ask
in
a
conference
is
about
the
thesis
of
the
paper,
and
here
I
was
going
to
my
WA
meeting
with
out
a
strong
thesis!
It
turned
out
that
there
was
a
strong
thesis;
it
just
needed
to
be
spelled
out
more
clearly.
The
meeting
was
a
good
reminder
to
me
about
the
importance
of
dialoguing
with
someone
else
about
your
writing.
Fresh
eyes
can
usually
find
areas
that
need
improvement.
My
British
Literature
class
was
another
great
opportunity
for
me
to
grow
as
a
writer.
We
had
to
write
a
two-page
response
paper
every
week
in
correlation
with
something
we
had
read
in
the
last
few
days
of
class.
While
there
was
some
vague
subject
matter
to
include
in
these
response
papers,
we
basically
had
to
freedom
to
write
what
we
wanted
and
how
we
wanted.
I
found
out
that
I
love
writing
about
poetry!
And
apparently
I
was
also
good
at
it.
Our
biggest
project
for
the
semester
was
a
ten-page
paper,
again
on
any
topic
from
the
class.
I
selected
several
poems
by
William
Butler
Yeats,
my
favorite
poet
from
the
class,
and
attempted
to
tie
them
together
in
a
discussion
of
the
"Joys
and
Sorrows
of
Love."
The
paper
initially
was
difficult
to
write
and
very
depressing
content
wise.
I
reluctantly
handed
in
a
rough
draft
that
may
have
been
well
written
but
didn't
really
say
what
I
wanted
it
to.
I
was
very
struck
by
my
professor
interest
in
my
work,
however.
It
can
be
difficult
for
an
outside
reader
to
appreciate
someone
else's
work
because
it
requires
getting
into
someone
else's
mind
and
figuring
out
where
he
or
she
is
coming
from
and
what
he
or
she
is
trying
to
say.
My
professor
surpassed
my
expectation,
though,
and
surprised
me.
She
handed
the
draft
back
to
me
with
suggestions
that
completely
gave
the
paper
a
new
direction.
Her
comments
got
my
paper
more
on
tract
and
helped
me
put
forth
a
final
product
that
I
was
really
proud
of.
She
was
a
great
example
to
me
of
what
a
WA
can
be
to
another
student.
I
hope
that
I
can
display
to
at
least
a
few
of
the
writers
that
I
meet
with
that
I
am
interested
in
what
they've
written
and
that
I'm
really
trying
to
understand
where're
they
are
coming
from
and
where
they
want
to
go.
In
the
last
year,
I
have
also
had
several
new
experiences
that
have
increased
my
versatility
in
the
world
of
writing,
the
first
being
scientific
writing.
In
both
my
Psychology
lab
and
Educational
Psychology
class,
I
wrote
several
scientific
papers.
The
transition
came
fairly
easily
to
me,
probably
because
there
were
so
many
rules.
I
like
to
have
rules
to
follow.
I'm
much
more
intimidated
by
creative
projects,
but
when
I
know
there
are
guidelines
I
feel
much
more
secure.
The
PLAs
were
also
a
very
big
help
the
transition
into
scientific
writing,
but
I
was
reminded
of
the
huge
difference
between
an
editor
and
the
role
of
a
WA.
I'm
glad
my
job
isn't
just
to
point
out
technical
errors
in
APA
or
ML
A
format!
The
second
new
experience
was
writing
in
a
language
other
than
English.
While
I
have
been
taking
French
classes
since
the
7
grade,
in
the
past
two
semesters
I've
taken
two
upper
level
French
courses
that
were
basically
comparable
to
my
other
classes
except
they
were
conducted
in
French!
I
have
never
written
so
much
in
another
language!
My
French
history
class
gave
me
my
first
opportunity
to
write
a
paper
with
real
substance,
not
just
about
my
summer
or
my
family
tree.
I
also
pulled
my
first
all-nighter!
It's
significantly
harder
and
more
time
consuming
to
write
a
seven-page
French
paper
than
to
write
a
seven-page
English
paper.
(Although
even
in
English,
French
history
is
extremely
complicated
with
all
those
kings
and
revolutions!)
In
my
French
literature
class,
I
wrote
my
first
two
thesis
centered
French
papers!
If
I
ever
thought
analyzing
literature
was
difficult,
it
is
a
whole
new
ball
game
when
doing
it
in
another
language!
Nonetheless,
I
was
very
surprised
at
my
ability
to
put
forth
a
paper
that
was
organized,
supported
with
textual
evidence,
centered
on
a
strong
thesis.
However,
I
felt
like
I
had
gone
back
in
time
to
the
days
of
the
five-paragraph
essay!
The
biggest
obstacle
was
trying
to
simplify
my
complex
ideas
due
to
a
more
limited
vocabulary.
In
this
class,
we
also
attempted
peer-editing
sessions.
The
goal
was
very
similar
to
that
of
the
College
Writing
program.
We
were
to
focus
on
the
"higher-order
concerns"
rather
than
only
grammar.
It
was
nice
to
see
other
departments
taking
part
in
improving
the
writer,
not
just
the
writing!
All
in
all,
I
am
not
bold
enough
to
say
that
I
have
completely
figured
myself
out
as
a
writer
just
yet.
However,
I
think
I
have
made
some
significant
observations
about
how
I
write,
what
I
like
to
write,
and
hopefully
how
I
can
help
others
write.
In
the
upcoming
year,
I'm
excited
to
get
to
know
other
students,
other
fellow
writers
with
individual
histories
and
identities.
While
I
am
not
going
to
begin
by
asking
for
their
identity
as
writers
in
three
sentences
or
less,
I
look
forward
to
helping
them
uncover
it
in
bits
and
pieces.
My
advice
for
myself
and
other
WAs
is
to
get
excited!
Little
is
more
exciting
to
me
than
dialoguing
with
fellow
writers
about
a
piece
of
work
about
which
they
are
passionate.
Although
it
can
be
discouraging
when
some
students
do
not
respond
well,
it
is
important
to
try
to
reach
them
where
they
are
and
cherish
the
students
who
are
interested.
Make
it
worth
their
while!
