NAll
good
writing
is
swimming
under
water
and
holding
your
breath.O-F.
Scott
Fitzgerald
As
fourth
grade
began
to
draw
to
a
close,
I
was
drowningNunable
to
stay
afloat
despite
my
love
for
the
academic
pool.
I
found
myself
seated
next
to
my
parents
in
the
principalOs
office
as
he
began
to
explain
my
shocking
standardized
test
scores.
Despite
my
excellent
classroom
performance,
my
test
scores
were
well
below
average
and
required
that
I
be
placed
in
a
NspecialO
classroom
for
young
men
and
women
like
myself.
Right
beside
the
principal
sat
my
biggest
ally,
my
fourth
grade
teacher
Mrs.
Phelps,
who
calmly
sat
back
in
her
chair
and
presumptuously
interrupted
the
principal,
Ngive
the
boy
a
pen
and
paper
and
you
will
soon
see
the
test
was
a
fluke.O
Despite
her
support,
Mrs.
Phelps
was
incorrect;
the
test
was
far
from
a
fluke.
I
have
continued
to
score
poorly
on
standardized
tests.
However,
I
have
continued
to
excel
at
writingNa
skill
that
early
standardized
test
predicted
I
would
not
be
able
to
master.
The
summer
between
fourth
and
fifth
grade
was
not
a
pleasant
one.
Although
I
took
part
in
all
the
normal
summer
activities
for
a
young
child
growing
up
in
New
Jersey,
visiting
the
beach
and
boardwalk,
playing
games
of
baseball
on
neighborhood
streets,
and
staying
up
late
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
fireworks
shot
off
in
the
distance,
writing
pervaded
my
thoughts.
I
had
always
enjoyed
writing
because
it
offered
an
opportunity,
whether
it
be
to
tell
a
fictional
tale
or
argue
in
favor
of
a
certain
proposal,
to
escape
everyday
life.
Yet,
writing
now
became
my
crutchNthe
only
thing
separating
me
from
the
class
for
NspecialO
boys
and
girls.
Afraid
to
speak
about
these
feelings
to
my
parents,
for
fear
they
would
make
me
all
the
more
nervous,
I
began
writing
my
feelings
down
in
a
blue
and
white
Yankees
notebook
that
my
grandfather
had
purchased
for
me
at
Yankee
Stadium
some
two
months
prior.
Given
that
it
was
summer,
I
left
formality
aside
and
began
writing
in
colored
pencils.
It
was
an
intriguing
writing
instrument,
as
it
let
me
match
different
colors
to
my
corresponding
mood.
I
was
able
to
think
through
my
thoughts
in
that
Yankee
notebook,
always
anxious
that
my
parents
might
discover
it
and
have
one
of
their
dreaded
hour-long
talks
with
me.
Unlike
most
children
my
age,
I
was
not
a
fan
of
drawing,
probably
because
my
drawing
skills
were
dreadful,
so
I
used
the
pages
to
write.
As
the
summer
came
to
a
close,
I
began
to
peruse
the
earlier
entries
in
my
notebook.
This
remains
one
of
my
most
gratifying
experiences
as
a
writer.
Although
my
writing
skills
did
not
evolve
through
the
pages,
my
ideas,
specifically
my
anxieties,
began
to
change
and
I
noticed
an
increased
air
of
maturity.
This
evolution
began
to
ease
my
fears
of
the
fifth
grade
as
I
came
to
the
realization
that,
despite
what
the
test
scores
indicated,
I
was
indeed
capable
of
handling
the
academic
challenges
to
come.
Unlike
many
of
my
peers,
I
found
middle
school
to
be
surprisingly
uneventful,
especially
in
terms
of
formal
writing.
The
assignments
were
somewhat
repetitive,
mostly
basic
research
papers,
and
I
quickly
became
frustrated
with,
what
I
perceived
as,
my
teachersO
pedantic
grading
methods.
However,
a
sixth
grade
history
class
offered
one
assignment
that
captivated
my
creative
spirit
and
solidified
my
passion
for
history
(my
current
major
at
Lafayette
College).
Overall,
I
found
the
history
class
to
be
rather
dull,
as
it
consisted
of
long
lectures
on
contemporary
U.S.
history.
Towards
the
end
of
the
year,
each
student
had
to
conduct
an
interview
with
an
older
family
member
or
friend
concerning
his
or
her
voting
history.
Given
that
I
wanted
to
finish
the
assignment
as
quickly
as
possible,
I
chose
my
familyOs
next
door
neighbor,
Rose,
who
had
lived
in
my
small
New
Jersey
town
since
1920.
The
experience
of
conducting
that
oral
history
was
one
that
altered
the
way
I
thought
about
the
world
and
my
place
within
it.
Rose
underscored
the
pride
she
had
when
she
went
to
the
ballot
box
each
yearNone
of
the
few
rights
women
had
in
the
mid
1900Os.
What
I
once
perceived
as
a
hassle
for
adults,
I
quickly
came
to
view
as
a
civic
responsibility
and
honor.
Being
that
I
was
only
in
sixth
grade,
I
was
not
able
to
express
the
lived
experience
of
a
1950Os
housewife
as
well
as
I
would
have
wanted
to.
However,
the
interview,
and
the
subsequent
written
report,
sparked
my
passion
for
the
past
that
continues
to
this
day.
Although
I
did
not
realize
it
at
the
time,
portraying
the
lived
experiences
of
people,
especially
when
some
are
unpleasant
and
uncomfortable,
is
no
easy
task.
Even
for
my
sixth
grade
report
I
struggled
trying
to
find
a
balance
between
overwhelming
the
reader
with
womenOs
repression,
for
fear
it
would
numb
my
audience,
and
portraying
enough
of
the
challenges
so
that
my
reader
could
adequately
see
the
struggles
women
like
Rose
faced
in
everyday
life.
Even
today,
as
I
work
on
my
honors
thesis
examining
the
triad
of
youth,
propaganda,
and
gender
relations
during
ArgentinaOs
Peronist
era
(1946-1955),
I
find
myself
still
struggling
with
such
a
balance.
For
the
first
time,
this
sixth
grade
report
allowed
my
writing
to
Ocome
aliveO
and
demonstrated
to
me
a
much
more
exciting
take
on
history
and
what
one
can
do
with
knowledge
of
the
past.
As
I
moved
into
high
school,
I
continued
my
love
of
history
and
historical
writing.
However,
I
was
unable
to
truly
enjoy
writing,
historical
or
otherwise,
given
the
large
strains
on
my
time
that
resulted
from
college
preparation,
which
ranged
from
SAT
pre
classes
to
tiresome
college
applications.
In
terms
of
writing,
high
school
was
perhaps
my
least
enjoyable
developmental
stage
as
a
writer.
In
fact
most
assignments
are
now
jumbled
together
in
my
mind
as
I
find
myself
struggling
to
select
one
I
recall
fondly.
Perhaps
my
fondest
memory
of
my
high
school
writing
was
a
junior
year
project
that
required
every
junior
to
write
and
recite
a
speech
in
front
of
the
a
handful
of
students
from
the
junior
class.
The
prompt
for
the
speech
was
quite
broad,
only
specifying
that
the
speech
must
be
related
to
Na
figure,
alive
or
dead,
who
has
stood
in
contrast
with
society.O
Given
my
enthusiasm
for
history,
I
selected
former
Wisconsin
Senator
Joseph
McCarthy,
the
most
visible
public
face
for
communist
subversion
in
the
mid-nineteenth
century
United
States.
McCarthy
accused
many
innocent
U.S.
government
employees
of
serving
as
soviet
spies,
destroying
many
lives
in
the
process.
Where
I
found
myself
struggling
was
in
my
attempt
to
capture
the
destruction
McCarthy
caused
to
so
many
honest
Americans.
After
much
internal
debate,
I
decided
words
could
not
adequately
portray
such
personal
ruin.
Thus,
I
opted
to
fold
up
photographs
of
the
innocent
men
and
women
whom
McCarthy
accused
and
preceded
to
tear
the
picture
in
half
as
I
detailed
their
broken
lives.
My
decision
to
tear
the
photographs
as
I
delivered
my
speech
was
received
with
great
approbation
from
my
teachers,
but
I
still
was
not
completely
satisfied
with
my
decision.
I
remained
disappointed
that
I
could
not
find
the
words
to
deliver
such
an
effect
and
hoped
my
upcoming
college
career
could
continue
my
growth
as
a
writerNan
evolution
that
I
hoped
would
one
day
allow
me
to
find
those
missing
words.
As
I
began
my
college
career
at
Franklin
and
Marshall
College,
I
felt
confident
in
my
abilities
as
a
writer.
I
had
graduated
high
school
with
honors
and
was
able
to
articulate
my
thoughts
in
a
clear
and
effective
manner.
Yet,
my
poise
was
quickly
shattered
when
I
entered
my
First
Year
Seminar:
NAmerica
in
the
Age
of
Nixon.O
Given
my
love
of
history,
I
eagerly
signed
up
for
the
course,
excited
to
learn
more
about
one
of
the
nationOs
most
polemical
leaders.
A
renowned
Nixon
scholar
who
had
just
completed
a
cultural
history
of
Richard
Nixon
that
demonstrated
how
AmericaOs
most
controversial
president
continues
to
haunt
AmericaOs
consciousness
taught
the
course
and
I
was
eager
to
learn
from
this
most
intriguing
scholar.
The
first
paper
was,
rather
predictably,
a
cultural
history
of
Nixon
that
asked
students
to
analyze
the
portrayal
of
NixonOs
Nsilent
majorityO
in
the
1970Os
hit
T.V.
show
All
in
the
Family.
I
readily
began
researching
by
watching
episode
upon
episode
of
All
in
the
Family
and
wrote,
what
I
believed
to
be,
a
superb
paper
detailing
the
subtle
political
sarcasm
imbedded
within
Archie
BunkerOs
(the
showOs
main
character)
hate
filled
rhetoric.
Given
my
confidence
in
my
work,
I
brought
a
draft
to
my
professorOs
office
and
expected,
though
as
I
now
know
naively,
to
hear
him
praise
my
efforts.
He
took
a
cursory
look
at
my
thesis
and
asked,
Nso
what?O
Seeing,
I
suspect,
the
bewilderment
in
my
eyes,
my
professor
handed
me
back
my
draft
and
explained
that
while
my
paper
appeared
to
be
a
good
high
school
paper,
it
did
not
meet
his
expectations
of
Nproper
college
writing.O
I
returned
to
my
dorm
room
with
my
draft
in
hand
left
to
wonder
how
I
could
possibly
meet
these
new
expectations.
Although
I
was
not
able
to
transform
my
writing
into
Nproper
college
writingO
for
the
first
paper
of
NAmerica
in
the
Age
of
Nixon,O
I
improved
with
each
assignment,
as
I
forced
myself
to
answer:
Nso
what?O
I
transferred
to
Lafayette
College
in
the
middle
of
my
freshman
year,
a
little
nervous
of
the
new
road
ahead,
but
confidant
that
I
would
be
able
to
handle
new
academic
challenges.
My
FYS
professorOs
one
simple
question,
one
that
he
uttered
so
quickly
on
a
gray
September
afternoon,
transformed
the
way
I
thought
about
writing
and
how
one
must
construct
a
unique
and
cogent
argument.
While
the
query
caused
me
much
stress
throughout
my
first
semester
in
college,
I
now
find
myself
eager
to
find
the
answer
when
I
begin
a
written
assignment.
Perhaps
my
most
challenging
writing
experience
at
Lafayette
came
last
year
when
I
had
the
opportunity
to
present
a
paper
at
a
conference
on
social
justice.
I
had
written
a
paper
criticizing
AmericaOs
portrayal
of
former
American
president
Andrew
Jackson
and
the
way
America
has
manipulated
popular
historical
consciousness
with
respect
to
the
former
president
and
war
hero.
Although
I
was
proud
of
my
paper
and
it
had
received
praise
from
faculty
member
in
the
history
department,
I
found
myself
unprepared
to
present
my
work
to
a
formal
panel
last
April.
Many
of
my
student
colleagues
criticized
my
writing,
not
for
the
actual
Owriting,O
but
for
the
argument
I
put
forth.
This
criticism
left
me
a
bit
nonplussedNwondering
why
the
paper
I
believed
to
be
my
finest
work
received
such
scorn.
I
soon
realized
that
some
of
the
hardest
material
to
write
is
that
which
is
uncomfortable
to
hear.
I
had
attacked
the
man
that
adorns
our
twenty-dollar
bill
and
my
peers
were
prepared
to
defend
JacksonOs
controversial
legacy
by
criticizing
my
paper.
Yet,
the
most
rewarding
result
of
such
an
experience
was
the
rich
debate
my
paper
sparked.
I
was
proud
I
helped
engender
such
discussion
and
have
continued
to
explore
polemical
historical
issues,
even
though
it
often
results
in
attacks
on
my
work.
Further,
I
have
learned
the
ability
to
offer
arguments
that
are
more
relative
than
absolute,
if
an
argument
can
truly
be
absolute.
Relative
conjectures
allow
students
to
start
discussions
that
often
produce
other
fruitful
ideas
and
opinions.
To
be
sure,
I
am
just
starting
to
explore
the
ways
writing
can
be
used
as
a
means
to
start
constructive
dialogue.
However,
I
am
eager
to
continue
exploring
such
methods,
ones
I
believe
will
help
students
with
both
written
and
oral
expression
of
ideas.
This
summer
I
have
continued
to
grow
as
a
writer.
I
spent
time
in
Argentina
researching
and
writing
a
chapter
of
my
senior
honors
thesis
and
have
begun
constructing
drafts
of
my
statement
of
purpose
that
will
be
part
of
my
graduate
school
applications.
I
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
exchange
drafts
of
my
thesis
chapter
with
my
peers
to
gain
their
feedback
on
my
work.
Such
an
experience
is
invaluableNas
someone
who
has
never
studied
social
and
gender
history
of
Peronist
Argentina
will
be
able
to
show
me
where
I
need
to
be
clearer
and
provide
more
contextual
information
for
my
reader.
In
addition
to
my
reading
for
my
honors
thesis,
I
have
also
done
quite
a
bit
of
free
time
reading
this
summer.
I
firmly
believe
that
good
writing
is
contagious.
I
have
perused
the
works
of
some
of
the
greatest
historians
in
all
different
areas
of
history
to
gain
a
sense
of
their
writing
style
and
tendencies.
Unlike
many
in
my
field,
I
do
not
believe
scholarly
writing
must
be
esoteric
to
be
effective.
In
fact,
I
believe
the
academy
sometimes
has
the
ability
to
cripple
oneOs
ability
to
write
clearly.
Thus,
as
I
progress
as
a
writer,
I
hope
to
find
a
balance
between
academic
and
popular
historical
writing.
Such
a
compromise
will
enable
me
to
adequately
heed
the
advice
of
F.
Scott
Fitzgerald
and
swim
under
water
while
also
holding
my
breath.
