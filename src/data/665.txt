Returning
WA
Narrative
Due:
8/20/10
The
essence
of
writing
is
communication.
This
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
lessons
I
have
learned
over
the
course
of
this
past
year.
It
is
almost
inevitable
for
writers
to
become
overwhelmed
with
a
topic,
assignment,
or
language
and
forget
what
they
are
ultimately
aspiring
to
do-
convey
something
to
an
audience.
That
something
and
the
audience
can
vary
widely
but
what
is
most
important
is
the
connection
made
between
the
writer
and
the
audience.
Every
word
has
purpose.
Because
we
use
writing
in
everything
we
do
(especially
schoolwork)
it
is
easy
to
be
careless
with
our
words
and
just
try
to
complete
an
assignment
without
much
thought
or
consideration.
Each
word
we
write
is
precious
and
must
be
transmitted
with
intent.
My
experiences
this
past
year
have
taught
me
that
writing
is
a
powerful
medium
utilized
in
every
facet
of
life,
business,
and
school.
We
must
never
forget
whom
we
are
writing
for
and
what
our
purpose
is.
My
Writing
Associate
Assignment
for
the
fall
semester
was
FYS:
Music
in
European
Society.
I
had
taken
this
FYS
as
a
freshman,
so
I
was
familiar
with
the
course,
subject,
logistics,
and
professor.
The
professor
I
worked
with
was
very
flexible
and
open
to
my
input.
This
was
a
wonderful
experience
because
I
helped
to
tailor
assignments.
For
instance,
we
added
a
conference
for
planning
a
draft
for
the
10
page
final
paper.
It
was
helpful
for
the
student
writers
to
meet
with
me
before
they
began
writing
because
we
discussed
the
purpose
of
the
paper
and
what
resources
to
consult
in
order
to
achieve
this
purpose.
I
talked
with
students
about
communicating
their
purpose
to
the
reader.
This
relived
some
stress
and
anxiety
because
it
provided
a
focus.
Planning
is
an
integral
part
of
writing
because
it
is
where
you
decide
who
your
readers
are,
what
you
want
to
convey
to
them,
and
how
you
are
going
to
accomplish
this.
However,
many
students
do
not
plan
before
they
write.
Time
constraints,
other
assignments,
practices,
and
the
tedium
of
doing
what
seems
like
extra
work
can
be
overwhelming
and
frustrating.
I
admit,
even
I
have
completed
many
assignments
without
prior
thoughtful
planning.
However,
this
experience
has
taught
me
how
important
it
is
to
strategize
your
writing.
It
is
imperative
to
ask
a
few
simply
questions,
including
NWho
is
the
audience?O
NWhat
do
they
need
to
know?O
NWhat
do
I
want/need
to
tell
them?O
and
finally
NHow
I
am
going
to
achieve
this?O
These
questions
help
to
organize
and
focus
writing.
My
Writing
Associate
Assignment
for
the
spring
semester
was
VAST:
Charles
Darwin,
Richard
Wagner,
and
the
Uses
and
Abuses
of
Nineteenth-Century
Science.
I
was
working
with
the
same
professor
I
had
in
the
fall,
so
I
was
familiar
with
his
teaching
and
assignment
style.
I
was
not,
however,
knowledgeable
with
the
course
topic.
This
proved
to
be
both
challenging
and
valuable.
When
I
WAed
FYS
papers
the
previous
semester,
I
assisted
the
student
writers
not
only
with
structural
and
grammatical
concerns,
but
also
with
accuracy
and
plausibility
of
facts.
I
could
suggest
resources
for
additional
material
and
recommend
areas
to
explore.
This
semester,
I
acted
as
a
reader
with
no
knowledge
of
the
subject
matter.
This
was
beneficial
to
the
student
writers
because
they
needed
to
communicate
with
me
(I
could
not
anticipate
what
they
wanted
to
say).
I
had
many
of
the
student
writers
walk
me
through
their
papers
and
explain
what
they
wanted
to
achieve.
This
prompted
the
students
to
synthesize
their
ideas
and
actually
formulate
a
thesis
statement
(I
have
found
that
if
you
ask
a
student
writer
what
they
want
the
audience
to
take
away
from
the
paper
they
create
a
sentence
or
two
that
can
be
used
as
a
thesis
statement.
However,
if
you
directly
ask
for
a
thesis
statement
they
become
hesitant
and
unsure
of
their
paper.
This
illustrates
the
power
of
words
and
how
language
can
influence
the
connotation).
WA
Conferences
not
only
facilitated
the
writing
of
my
student
writers
and
bolstered
their
confidence,
but
also
advanced
my
own
writing.
I
discovered
I
was
more
critical
of
my
own
writing
and
began
to
diagram
my
papers.
I
now
ask
myself
the
same
questions
I
ask
my
student
writers
in
conferences.
Although
my
experiences
as
a
WA
undoubtedly
shaped
my
writing,
my
most
influential
writing
experiences
this
year
have
been
my
internships
at
The
Leukemia
and
Lymphoma
Society,
Good
Housekeeping
Magazine,
and
MakeoverMomma.com.
I
learned
that
writing
is
not
merely
an
assignment
for
class;
it
is
also
a
means
of
sharing
information
and
connecting
to
people.
You
must
be
aware
of
what
you
want
to
say
and
also
anticipate
what
your
audience
wants
to
know.
At
the
Leukemia
and
Lymphoma
Society,
I
worked
on
a
Back
to
School
Program
for
children
it
cancer.
The
goal
was
to
create
a
backpack
that
included
resources
for
children,
siblings,
parents,
teachers,
and
friends.
Being
told
that
your
child,
sibling,
or
friend
has
cancer
is
the
undoubtedly
one
of
the
most
frightening,
disheartening,
and
chaotic
moments
of
oneOs
life.
A
mirage
of
medical
terms,
financial
questions,
and
emotional
decisions
arise.
We
wanted
to
let
these
families
know
that
they
did
not
have
to
navigate
this
winding
and
uncertain
road
alone.
After
extensive
research,
I
found
countless
resources
to
assuage
concerns
and
help
traverse
diagnosis,
treatment,
and
beyond.
My
job
included
the
compilation
of
a
list
of
the
online
resources
that
were
the
clearest
and
most
straightforward
for
grief
stricken
and
overwhelmed
parents.
I
also
provided
informational
books
help
guide
parents
through
the
new
world
of
cancer
and
its
implications,
including
doctors
appointments,
changes
in
family
schedules,
treatment
options,
school
issues,
etc.
We
also
included
age-appropriate
books
for
the
children
to
educate
them
about
cancer,
provide
ways
for
coping,
and
give
them
hope.
Children
are
aware
of
more
than
we
typically
give
them
credit
for.
If
we
do
not
provide
explanations
for
the
changes
they
(or
their
sibling)
are
experiencing,
they
will
concoct
their
own
explanation
for
cancer.
Thus,
we
need
to
utilize
age
appropriate
vocabulary
and
offer
descriptions
of
the
disease,
treatments,
and
changes
they
will
experience.
Lastly,
we
included
journals
to
provide
space
for
the
child
to
express
him
or
herself.
Writing
and
drawing
are
therapeutic
outlets
for
teenagers
and
children.
Art
allows
children
to
illustrate
feelings
and
questions
they
do
not
have
the
vocabulary
or
knowledge
to
articulate.
Even
children
as
young
as
three
and
four
yearn
for
independence
and
want
to
assert
their
personality.
We
provide
journals
so
that
children
can
explore
their
emotions
and
write
or
draw
about
whatever
they
want.
They
have
the
power
to
construct
whatever
story
is
on
their
minds.
We
used
writing
in
many
stages
of
this
project.
We
had
to
research
various
books
and
websites
in
order
to
find
the
unambiguous
and
most
helpful
cancer
explanation.
Writing
is
also
a
means
of
self
expression
and
therapy.
Free
writing
and
keeping
a
journal
alleviates
stress
and
allow
both
children
and
parents
to
express
themselves
in
a
safe
manner.
Writing
can
be
employed
for
many
purposes
but
will
always
promote
communication
and
the
transmission
of
thoughts,
ideas,
feelings,
news,
etc.
At
Good
Housekeeping,
I
worked
as
an
intern
in
the
Consumer
Electronics
Laboratory
in
the
Good
Housekeeping
Research
Institute.
Good
Housekeeping
rigorously
evaluates
and
tests
the
products
that
are
featured
in
the
magazine
(both
in
articles
and
advertisements).
The
staff
is
composed
of
scientists,
researchers,
and
engineers
who
test
everything
from
smartphones
and
digital
cameras
to
recipes
and
towels.
The
Consumer
Electronics
Laboratory
is
managed
by
four
engineers.
From
May
until
August,
our
large
projects
included
smartphones,
digital
photo
frames,
sewing
machines,
DSLR
cameras,
big
screen
televisions,
eReaders,
folding
chairs,
digital
scales,
towels
and
toys.
We
also
tested
some
smaller
samples
of
products
for
blogs
and
smaller
Nround-ups.O
One
of
the
first
lessons
I
learned
at
Good
Housekeeping
was
that
the
magazine
industry
works
at
least
6
months
in
advance!
In
July,
we
had
over
100
children
come
to
the
lab
to
test
toys
for
the
holiday
issue.
My
bosses
needed
to
anticipate
that
products
would
be
practical
based
on
the
season.
I
expected
testing
to
be
scrupulous,
but
had
no
idea
what
to
expect.
I
was
nervous
that
my
English
and
Psychology
background
would
be
insufficient
for
the
technical
tests
they
would
be
conducting
in
the
engineering
lab.
However,
I
found
that
my
fears
were
unwarranted.
I
knew
the
scientific
method
and
steps
for
scientific
testing
from
the
Psychology
statistics
and
research
design
classes.
In
the
Consumer
Electronics
Laboratory
we
tested
durability,
safety,
ease
of
use,
customer
service
help,
and
other
important
factors
consumers
should
consider
before
buying
a
product.
Writing
was
an
integral
aspect
throughout
the
testing
process.
I
needed
to
communicate
with
various
companies
over
the
phone
and
via
email
in
order
to
explain
who
I
was
and
why
we
needed
a
product
sample.
Especially
in
emails,
effective
language
and
concise
prose
is
necessary.
The
care
you
put
into
an
email
illustrates
the
attention
and
precision
you
provide
every
client
and
task.
Moreover,
I
learned
the
difficulty
of
translating
technical
jargon
into
prose
that
is
comprehensible
and
practical.
The
typical
Good
Housekeeping
reader
does
not
have
an
engineering
degree,
but
they
still
want
to
know
what
the
best
product
is
and
why.
This
task
illustrates
the
use
of
writing
as
a
means
of
communication.
We
must
be
able
to
effectively
summarize
our
testing
procedures
in
order
to
help
our
readers
save
money,
time,
and
find
the
best
products
out
there.
Lastly,
I
was
a
writer
and
New
York
intern
for
MakeoverMomma.com.
I
received
weekly
article
assignments
to
feature
beauty
products,
exercise
equipment,
etc.
My
audience
was
new
moms
who
wanted
to
get
back
into
shape
and
feel
good
about
themselves.
This
was
very
important
to
know
as
I
began
to
be
assigned
product
reviews.
I
highlighted
the
aspects
of
products
that
were
most
beneficial
to
moms.
I
also
wrote
a
weekly
fitness
article.
This
was
a
rewarding
article
because
I
utilized
my
voice.
I
could
incorporate
my
experiences
and
interests.
It
took
me
a
few
weeks
to
be
comfortable
writing
in
first
person,
but
once
I
discovered
how
to
be
myself
in
written
word,
I
felt
empowered.
As
New
York
intern
for
MakeoverMomma.com,
I
was
awarded
the
opportunity
to
attend
various
events
and
then
write
about
my
experiences.
This
was
exciting-
I
felt
like
a
reporter!
I
went
to
Holiday
Previews
for
companies,
media
breakfasts,
and
charity
events.
At
first,
capturing
what
I
saw
was
difficult.
However,
I
learned
that
I
should
start
by
using
my
senses
and
to
explain
what
I
saw,
smelled,
touched,
etc.
After
depicting
the
atmosphere,
I
then
worked
my
way
up
to
the
products
or
personalities
being
featured.
Writing
these
articles
was
a
means
of
arresting
time
and
sharing
my
sensations
and
emotions
with
an
audience.
I
have
undergone
much
growth
and
development
over
this
past
year
as
a
writer.
I
have
seen
that
writing
is
used
in
many
aspects
of
life
outside
the
classroom.
When
writing
becomes
part
of
a
job,
it
is
an
integral
means
of
communicating
not
only
with
colleagues
but
also
readers
and
clients.
Thus,
it
is
essential
to
identify
who
the
audience
is
and
what
you
want
to
share
with
them.
This
should
be
what
drives
your
writing.
