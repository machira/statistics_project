To
chart
my
history
as
a
writer
it
seems
only
logical
to
start
at
the
beginning.
Writing,
like
most
other
activities,
can
be
cultivated,
strengthened,
and
refined.
I
recall
my
initial
encounter
with
writing
began
at
the
age
of
seven.
I
attended
kindergarten
with
most
other
children
my
age.
Although
rudimentary,
it
was
in
this
setting
where
my
first
writing
took
place,
alongside
other
children
who
were
also
learning
to
write
for
the
first
time.
The
ability
to
read
was
certainly
a
prerequisite
for
writing
in
my
school,
and
so
while
some
of
the
kids
in
class
could
read
at
very
basic
levels
allowing
them
to
cross
the
boundary
between
reading
and
writing,
I
initially
encountered
much
difficulty
with
the
entire
pursuit.
I
remember
coming
home
from
school
one
day
and
feeling
a
sense
of
weakness
or
inadequacy
because
I
wasnOt
progressing
the
way
many
of
my
classmates
were.
It
was
not
until
years
later
that
I
discovered
that
the
difficulty
I
experienced
with
my
initial
encounter
with
reading
and
writing
had
its
roots
in
the
curriculum.
My
school
took
a
Owhole
language
approachO
as
opposed
to
the
time
honored
phonics
based
curriculum.
This
essentially
would
not
work
for
me.
Although
I
was
too
young
to
understand
it
at
the
time,
there
was
an
underlying
sense,
even
in
such
a
little
boyOs
mind
as
my
own,
that
reading
and
writing
were
integral
to
living.
Everywhere
I
went,
in
the
car,
on
the
street,
in
the
store,
there
were
things
to
be
read
everywhere.
And
this
inability
to
process
all
these
things,
from
reading
the
label
on
a
can
of
soup
to
reading
a
sentence
in
school
stories
of
Jack
and
Jill,
stimulated
in
me
a
desire
to
read
and
write.
So
one
day
I
at
the
behest
of
my
parents
I
deferred
to
the
one
person
I
knew
who
might
be
able
to
help
me
overcome
my
weakness,
my
grandmother.
My
Grandma
Marie
was
a
teacher
in
the
Bronx
for
many
years
with
a
concentration
in
special
education.
Therefore
her
focus
was
on
helping
those
students
who
encountered
the
most
trouble
with
learning.
She
also
was
committed
to
phonics
as
the
cornerstone
of
all
reading
skills.
I
hoped,
even
at
such
a
young
age,
this
expertise
would
help
transform
me
into
the
reader
and
writer
I
aspired
to
be,
however
basic.
So
on
our
first
lesson,
my
grandmother
and
I
sat
next
to
each
other
at
her
dinner
table
and
started
from
the
bottom.
She
unloaded
an
arsenal
of
school
supplies
from
when
she
taught
in
the
Bronx,
simple
childrenOs
stories,
pens
and
pencils,
stickers
for
good
work,
etc.
I
started
out
slowly
that
first
Sunday
we
met,
barely
able
to
read
a
sentence
from
the
childrenOs
book
she
made
me
wade
through,
page
by
page,
even
though
I
struggled.
Alongside
me
she
helped
me
through
the
words
I
simply
couldnOt
articulate.
I
made
mistake
after
mistake
after
mistake.
Yet
each
Sunday
my
Grandma
continued
to
tutor
me
and
very
slowly
I
began
to
make
progress.
She
never
became
impatient
with
me
and
never
allowed
me
to
discourage
myself
in
the
face
of
a
challenging
sentence
or
a
word
I
couldnOt
pronounce.
Each
week
we
moved
through
more
and
more
material
that
Grandmother
had
provided
and
by
the
time
I
finished
first
grade
I
had
learned
how
to
read
and
to
write.
I
walked
into
my
first
day
of
second
grade
feeling
confident
and
proud,
grateful
that
I
had
someone
so
special
to
teach
me
such
invaluable
skills.
My
first
grade
teacher,
Mrs.
Grogan,
asked
the
class
to
write
just
one
or
two
sentence
about
themselves.
I
know
it
doesnOt
sound
like
much,
but
one
of
the
best
feelings
I
ever
experienced
in
academic
setting
was
at
this
moment.
I
could
write
several
sentences
about
myself
and
that
just
felt
incredible.
I
enjoyed
the
first
few
years
of
school
because
I
was
confident
in
my
own
ability
among
my
teacher
and
peers.
I
felt
as
if
I
had
overcome
some
enormous
deficiency
or
some
tragic
flaw.
ItOs
almost
laughable
but
learning
how
to
read
and
write
was
paramount
to
my
development.
Elementary
school
can
be
a
tough
place
for
some
kids,
especially
for
those
who
struggle
with
school.
I
was
lucky
that
I
had
my
grandmother
to
teach
to
read
and
write
to
help
ease
my
own
struggle.
At
this
juncture
an
ironic
aside
concerning
my
grandmother
is
worth
telling
because
of
the
powerful
lifeOs
lesson
that
it
taught
me.
Although
the
woman
who
tutored
me
is
still
alive
today,
she
does
not
truly
exist
in
the
same
form.
This
woman
was
the
assistant
principle
of
a
school,
wife,
mother
of
four
children,
and
grandmother;
throughout
all
of
these
roles
she
juggled
them
perfectly
and
almost
magically.
She
was
capable
of
carrying
on
multiple
sophisticated
conversations
while
preparing
Sunday
dinner
for
children
and
grandchildren.
She
was
acutely
aware
of
what
was
going
on
in
everyoneOs
life
and
was
never
at
a
loss
for
a
strong
yet
insightful
opinion.
Several
years
ago
this
bright
and
matriarchal
figure
was
gradually
stolen
from
me
by
dementia.
Her
mental
deterioration
was
rapid
and
insidious.
Fortunately,
she
still
recognizes
me
as
her
Grandson,
but
this
seems
to
be
the
extent
of
it.
However,
the
legacy
that
she
imparted
to
me
can
never
be
taken
away.
There
was
love
and
caring
in
each
lesson
that
she
provided
which
I
realize
now
created
the
foundation
for
my
reading
and
writing
skills
today.
Beyond
that,
however,
I
have
learned
perhaps
a
more
valuable
skill
than
writing.
I
have
learned
that
the
things
you
value
in
life
are
often
transient
and
therefore
must
be
cherished
to
the
fullest.
This
academic
and
emotional
foundation
became
a
source
of
inner
strength
and
point
of
departure
for
my
continued
evolution
as
a
writer.
With
each
passing
year,
the
basic
skills
that
my
grandmother
had
passed
on
to
me
were
implemented
in
an
academic
setting.
During
my
self-reflection
on
this
topic,
I
have
realized
there
were
certain
defining
moments
at
each
level
of
my
precollege
education.
For
example,
in
fourth
grade
I,
for
the
first
time,
was
required
to
keep
a
journal
of
my
daily
activities
which
would
be
submitted
and
returned
by
my
teacher
Mrs.
Laitman.
I
became
very
comfortable
with
the
written
word,
and
this
daily
exercise
like
most
other
exercised
led
to
a
dramatic
growth
in
my
expression
as
a
writer.
However
mundane
the
details
were,
I
went
to
the
journal.
With
a
sharpened-number
two
in
hand,
I
would
write
the
date
in
the
top
left
hand
corner
my
name
underneath,
with
my
daily
thoughts
jotted
down
underneath.
This
journal
was
an
effective
instrument
of
teaching
for
Mrs.
Laitman
and
I
attribute
much
elementary
school
growth
to
her
individual
techniques,
such
as
this
journal.
I
moved
onto
middle
school
in
sixth
grade,
reading
and
writing
at
that
respective
level
and
higher.
I
enjoyed
middle
school
because
I
was
able
to
perform
and
function
in
class.
This
academic
success
spurred
on
self-assurance
in
and
outside
of
the
classroom.
Whereas
I
used
to
feel
weak
because
I
couldnOt
read
and
write,
now
I
felt
mighty.
I
breezed
through
those
middle
years,
unaware
of
the
frustration
that
lay
ahead
for
me.
My
first
day
of
high
school,
I
met
the
most
obsessive
writing
teacher
I
would
ever
encounter,
Mrs.
Selby.
This
woman
in
her
early
60s
conjured
up
the
image
of
a
Norman
Rockwell
grandmother
inviting
young
children
into
her
kitchen
for
some
apple
pie.
However,
this
outer
appearance
and
demeanor
belied
the
beast
that
lie
within.
It
quickly
became
evident
that
she
was
more
akin
to
a
marine
core
sergeant
intimidating
the
new
recruits
during
basic
training.
The
job
of
the
drill
sergeant
is
not
to
befriend
the
troops
but
to
place
demands
upon
them
which
will
stretch
them
to
their
limit.
The
troops
may
misunderstand
and
resent
this
tyrannical
approach
during
the
process,
yet
they
fast
realize
that
this
approach
has
transformed
them
into
individuals
who
will
successfully
complete
their
task
as
soldiers
and
perhaps
even
save
lives.
The
comparison
of
Ms.
Selby
to
the
autocratic
drill
sergeant
is
most
appropriate.
The
subject
which
she
taught
was
World
History,
but
that
is
unimportant;
it
could
have
been
any
topic,
it
could
have
been
any
subject.
The
main
point
was
that
Mrs.
Selby
was
a
writing
fanatic.
She
was
not
interested
in
class
participation
or
multiple
choice
tests.
Every
assignment
which
came
at
the
end
of
every
class
required
at
least
a
1-3
page
essay
on
matters
discussed
in
the
class
and
in
our
text
book.
Initially,
this
seemed
like
a
daunting
and
formidable
undertaking.
I
recall
on
the
first
night
after
class
brainstorming
the
assigned
topic
and
after
one
hour
of
writing,
I
had
not
completed
a
page.
This
continued
from
day
to
day
and
my
ability
to
find
the
right
words
for
my
thoughts
became
more
enhanced.
At
the
end
of
the
first
semester,
I
was
able
to
churn
out
three
pages
on
any
relevant
topic
for
the
class.
This
skill
transcended
Mrs.
SelbyOs
class
and
became
applicable
to
my
other
subjects
as
well.
I
now
understand
the
rigorous
process
that
this
teacher
put
us
through
and
the
method
to
her
madness.
Each
essay
that
I
handed
in
was
returned
within
a
day
replete
with
harsh
criticism
and
commentary
just
as
you
might
expect
from
a
marine
drill
sergeant.
This
teacher
was
not
known
for
her
sensitivity.
My
paragraphs
were
either
too
long
or
too
short;
my
thesis
statement
usually
missed
the
mark;
my
conclusion
paragraph
never
sufficiently
united
the
arguments
presented
in
the
essay.
The
margins
were
filled
with
notes
written
in
a
red
ballpoint
pen
admonishing
me
to
expand
this
thought
or
to
reduce
or
eliminate
another.
Every
possible
detail
was
scrutinized.
This
painful
degradation
of
my
writing,
although
frustrating,
left
me
with
two
choices:
quitting
school
or
meeting
the
expectations
of
Sergeant
Selby.
I
chose
the
latter.
As
I
continued
to
write
each
assignment,
I
would
strive
to
anticipate
the
criticism
to
come
and
endeavor
to
make
that
essay
invulnerable
to
her
assault.
Surprisingly,
as
the
school
year
progressed
the
red
ink
on
my
papers
began
to
ameliorate.
Occasionally,
would
miraculously
appear
two
words:
NGood
job!O
Her
job
was
done.
Although
I
only
had
Ms.
Selby
for
that
one
first
year,
her
impact
was
immeasurable.
I
applied
the
same
techniques
I
had
learned
in
her
class
to
all
my
other
academic
pursuits.
I
finished
high
school
prepared
for
the
writing
that
was
ahead
at
the
university
level.
My
first
college
writing
class
was
English
110,
the
required
writing
class
for
all
incoming
freshman.
In
it
class
we
wrote
about
what
constituted
Ngood
artO.
There
was
no
right
or
wrong
answer
for
what
exactly
good
art
was;
it
was
about
the
argument
we
made
for
why
it
was
good.
The
same
critical
lens
I
applied
to
my
writing
in
high
school
as
a
result
of
Ms.
Selby
was
applied
to
my
college
writing.
I
truly
enjoyed
my
freshman
year
in
college
writing,
or
English
110,
and
my
decision
to
become
an
English
major
occurred
because
of
my
interest
in
continuing
a
writing-intensive
curriculum.
Starting
sophomore
year
I
declared,
officially,
that
I
was
an
English
major
at
Lafayette
College.
It
seemed
ironic
to
me
that
someone
who
struggled
so
much
with
writing
at
a
young
age
could
be
so
heavily
immersed
in
it
years
later.
My
interest
in
English
has
led
me
to
apply
for
a
summer
teaching
position
working
with
inner
city
youths
in
Yonkers,
NY.
I
got
the
job
as
a
summer
tutor
and
began
working
in
June.
As
a
summer
tutor,
I
worked
at
Riverside
High
School
alongside
Mrs.
Ukponwan,
and
together
we
taught
sixth
graders
English
and
Social
Studies.
For
this
summer
job
I
thought
three
different
groups
of
children,
blocks
1,
2,
and
3.
Third
block
was
the
smallest
class
of
children
and
included
two
students
who
spoke
very
limited
English.
Both
children,
Ralph
and
Yeni,
were
from
the
Dominican
Republic.
On
a
daily
basis
I
worked
with
them
generating
short
but
coherent
English
papers,
however
slow
they
took
to
complete
them.
In
this
case,
it
is
not
about
who
finished
the
fastest
but
who
understood
and
enjoyed
the
work
they
completed.
For
Ralph
and
Yeni,
writing
a
page
in
English
for
class
assignment
was
tremendously
rewarding,
and
the
I
could
relate
to
pleasure
they
got
from
writing;
both
students
reminded
me
of
when
I
first
began
to
write
with
my
grandmother.
In
my
experience,
just
as
Ralph
and
Yeni
worked
through
obstacles
like
the
language
barrier
to
develop
their
writing,
other
students
worked
their
hardest
for
minute
incentives.
For
example,
for
my
two
early
classes,
English
and
Social
Studies,
Mrs.
Ukponwan
and
I
created
a
system
of
rewards
to
encourage
students
to
complete
their
work
efficiently.
It
is
amazing
how
small
prizes
can
stimulate
children
into
learning
and
academic
growth.
Each
class
we
promised
students
that
if
they
finished
their
work
in
a
timely
and
effective
manner
they
would
all
receive
a
gold
coin.
Essentially,
the
best
work
deemed
by
Mrs.
Ukponwan
and
I
would
receive
the
most
gold
coins.
So
if
a
student
did
exceptional
or
quality
work
they
might
receive
two
gold
coins.
These
small
plastic
gold
coins
went
a
long
way,
and
served
as
incentives
for
these
young
children
to
hone
in
on
their
writing
and
reading.
Upon
self
reflection,
itOs
interesting
to
observe
how
I
went
from
having
so
much
difficulty
with
reading
and
writing
to
a
point
where
I
taught
in
a
summer
school.
For
me
my
development
as
a
writer
had
come
full
circle.
Now
I
look
forward
to
working
at
Lafayette
helping
others
with
their
writing.
Hopefully
they
will
find
great
pleasure
in
writing
as
I
always
have.
