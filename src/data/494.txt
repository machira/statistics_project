My
Literacy
Narrative
When
I
think
back
on
my
early
childhood,
I
am
often
frustrated
because
the
line
between
an
actual
memory
and
one
formulated
from
the
repetition
of
stories
often
blurs.
I
distinctly
remember
many
moments
from
about
age
three
on.
But
then
there
are
the
stories
my
parents
have
told
over
and
over
again
p
like
the
one
where
I
dive
out
of
my
crib
looking
for
the
light
switch
p
that
have
created
an
artificial
memory,
replacing
the
void
left
by
my
once-infant
mind.
Whatus
interesting
is
that
memories
about
reading
and
writing
stick
out
from
this
hazy
line.
I
cannot
tell
you
the
exact
date
when
these
memories
begin,
but
I
know
they
are
not
a
mere
creation.
I
specifically
remember
sitting
at
the
kitchen
counter
in
my
familyus
first
house,
writing
p
probably
in
crayon
p
my
name
on
white
sheet
of
paper.
The
letters
were
poorly
formed.
The
rBs
was
too
big,
foreshadowing
a
later
obsession
with
my
signature.
The
rrians
slanted
down
to
the
far
right
and
the
first
line
on
the
rns
stuck
up
too
high,
making
it
look
like
an
rh.s
But
this
was
pre-kindergarten,
and
probably
even
pre-preschool,
and
my
audience
did
not
care.
The
writing
I
did
in
preschool
was
not
even
writing.
I
doubt
I
could
form
all
twenty-six
letters
by
the
time
I
finished
that
year
at
the
nursery
school,
but
I
do
remember
writing
my
name
over
and
over
again.
And
that
was
probably
about
it.
There
was
a
lot
of
coloring,
too
many
rants-on-a-logs
snack
times,
and
a
near-daily
game
of
tag
on
the
playground.
It
was
not
yet
a
classroom
setting;
the
giant
easels
with
perfect
teacher
handwriting
and
the
wallpaper
of
upper
and
lower-case
letters
were
still
a
year
away.
Nursery
school
was
a
time
for
singing
the
A,B,Cs,
not
writing
them.
In
kindergarten,
my
name
became
slightly
more
legible.
We
spent
the
year
learning
each
letter
of
the
alphabet,
spending
a
week
on
each.
My
classmates
and
I
(or
rather,
our
parents)
brought
in
snacks
that
began
with
the
weekus
corresponding
letter:
more
ants-on-a-log
for
A,
cookies
for
C,
and
a
lame
attempt
to
pass
off
Doritos
as
Tortilla
chips.
We
even
started
learning
some
words,
dissecting
rcats,s
rdogs,s
and
the
especially
tricky
rthe.s
By
the
end
of
my
first
year
of
school,
I
had
the
alphabet
down
cold.
Around
that
same
time,
perhaps
even
earlier,
my
memories
of
my
parents
reading
to
me
are
clear.
I
remember
sitting
on
the
bed
in
my
first
house,
hearing
Goodnight
Moon.
I
didnut
look
too
closely
at
the
words
on
the
page,
but
as
my
dad
magically
read
them
aloud,
I
followed
along
closely
to
the
pictures.
There
was
also
my
obsession
with
the
Transformers
series
p
robots
who
turned
from
everyday
cars
and
trucks
into
awesome
fighting
machines.
My
parents
tell
me
I
could
recite
the
books
by
heart
because
I
heard
them
so
many
times,
but
I
choose
to
think
I
was
simply
a
gifted
young
reader.
First
grade
upped
the
anty
on
the
alphabet.
I
learned
how
to
form
sentences
p
simple
sentences
about
the
cat
and
the
dog,
but
sentences
nonetheless.
There
was
also
the
ever-present
lined
paper
meant
for
working
on
your
handwriting.
Capital
letters
stretched
all
the
way
to
the
top,
lower
case
letters
to
the
dotted
middle
line.
I
wrote
each
letter
over
and
over
again,
always
starting
with
my
name
in
the
corner.
And
for
some
unknown
reason,
(most
might
call
this
an
ego
problem)
I
loved
seeing
my
name
on
that
page.
The
hazy
memory
line
ends
by
second
grade.
I
clearly
remember
reading
longer
books
on
my
own.
Although
I
canut
recall
any
specific
books
from
school
in
either
of
those
years,
I
do
remember
summer
competitions
for
the
number
of
books
you
could
read
at
my
townus
library.
My
mom
would
take
my
sisters
and
me
down
at
the
beginning
of
every
summer,
sign
us
up,
and
weud
look
through
the
childrenus
section
for
covers
that
enticed
us.
I
was
never
a
prolific
reader
when
I
was
in
elementary
school.
And
much
to
my
dismay,
my
younger
sisters
always
read
more
than
me,
winning
prizes
of
Wendyus
Frosties.
Third
grade
also
brought
the
new
idea
of
cursive
handwriting.
I
hated
cursive.
I
already
knew
one
way
to
form
letters
that
seemed
fast
and
easy.
Why
should
I
have
to
learn
another?
Books
werenut
printed
in
cursive.
The
only
positive
attribute
of
cursive
was
the
development
of
my
signature.
By
the
fourth
grade,
I
was
very
impressed
with
myself
and
my
awesome
new
signature.
I
doodled
it
everywhere,
even
picking
up
a
slick
formation
of
the
rBs
from
an
autographed
Bruce
Covel
novel
about
aliens.
The
next
year,
I
began
reading
more
on
my
own,
although
most
of
it
was
spurred
on
by
a
running
log
kept
in
my
forth
grade
classroom.
I
didnut
like
to
lose,
so
I
kept
reading
and
ended
up
with
the
highest
total
of
extra
books
read
by
the
end
of
the
year.
Following
that
year,
however,
the
number
of
books
I
read
out
of
school
for
pure
enjoyment
took
a
nose
dive.
Only
occasionally
over
the
next
five
or
six
years
would
I
really
become
engrossed
in
a
book.
I
never
wanted
to
sit
in
one
place
for
an
hour
and
read
a
book.
I
would
have
rather
built
spaceships
out
of
my
Legos.
Throughout
those
years
p
the
dark
ages,
if
you
will
p
I
always
liked
the
books
we
read
in
school,
but
few
truly
captivated
me.
The
ones
that
did
were
usually
exciting
to
a
10-13-year-old
boy:
My
Brother
Sam
is
Dead,
Johnny
Tremain,
and
anything
by
Roald
Dahl.
I
was
never
apathetic
about
early
English
assignments,
but
they
never
thrilled
me
either.
I
thought
elementary
school
book
reports
were
pretty
boring.
But
on
the
boredom
scale,
book
reports
paled
compared
to
narrative
writing
prompts.
Starting
in
third
grade,
elementary
school
teachers
in
Connecticut
begin
prepping
their
students
for
the
stateus
first
wave
of
standardized
testing.
The
English
portion
of
the
test
was
a
vague
idea
like,
rYou
wander
into
your
grandmotherus
basement
and
find
an
old
chestis
At
that
point,
my
grammar
was
probably
sub-par,
and
I
wasnut
very
good
at
coming
up
with
creative
storylines
on
the
spot.
There
was
no
sense
of
purpose
to
my
writing
then.
I
was
merely
writing
to
get
to
the
end.
In
middle
school,
teachers
eschew
what
I
now
realize
was
an
unrestricted
narrative
for
a
focused
(and
bland)
expository
style.
I
was
handed
a
topic
and
sometimes
some
background
materials
and
told
to
write
down
information.
There
was
no
position
taken
in
these
prompts,
just
five
paragraphs
of
information.
From
then
until
my
senior
year
of
high
school,
nearly
every
piece
of
writing
was
required
to
have
five
paragraphs:
the
introduction,
the
three
body
paragraphs,
and
the
conclusion.
Although
I
was
never
thrilled
to
write
an
expository
prompt,
my
mind
was
very
good
at
following
the
formula.
I
picked
up
quickly
on
the
introduction
sentences,
how
to
list
the
key
ideas
in
the
first
paragraph,
and
how
to
hit
the
reader
hard
with
something
new
in
the
conclusion,
hoping
the
last
idea
a
teacher
reads
will
stick
with
them.
My
English
teachers
also
assigned
us
to
keep
several
journals
in
which
we
responded
to
the
different
books
we
read.
I
always
enjoyed
the
freedom
on
the
journal
more,
but
looking
back
on
my
work,
realize
that
I
was
often
at
a
loss
for
words
without
the
prompt
and
the
formula
of
the
five
paragraph
essay.
By
eighth
grade,
the
expository
writing
I
had
been
doing
finally
became
relevant
as
it
switched
to
a
persuasive
context.
Instead
of
simply
writing
about
the
patterns
of
penguins,
I
was
able
to
stake
out
a
position
on
an
argument
and
rationalize
my
ideas.
I
took
stances
on
the
addition
of
tennis
courts
to
my
school,
the
lack
of
a
recess
at
the
middle
school
level,
and
the
selection
of
food
at
the
cafeteria.
At
that
time,
I
may
have
thought
those
issues
were
relevant,
but
I
was
more
excited
to
argue
a
position.
I
felt
like
a
trial
lawyer.
But
the
best
part
was
that
I
could
feel
one
way
and
write
an
opposite
stance
because
I
knew
it
sounded
better.
I
always
chose
the
more
concrete
argument,
the
one
with
the
fewest
holes.
Each
teacher
drilled
home
the
fact
that
with
an
academic
five
paragraph
essay,
I
was
always
writing
for
an
audience.
So
I
took
that
to
heart
and
tried
to
manipulate
the
reader.
I
realized
that
he
or
she
had
no
idea
what
I
actually
felt
inside.
All
that
mattered
were
the
words
on
the
page.
It
was
an
empowering
feeling,
knowing
that
I
could
essentially
lie
to
my
teacher,
but
still
get
one
of
the
few
coveted
11s
or
12s
on
the
final
product.
I
rarely
received
anything
but
compliments
from
teachers
on
persuasive
writing
throughout
middle
school.
Thatus
why
high
school
English
came
as
a
rude
awakening.
Suddenly,
I
wasnut
in
the
comfort
of
a
provided
writing
prompt
anymore.
The
five
paragraphs
remained,
but
now
I
was
forced
to
write
commentary
on
novels
we
had
read.
The
idea
of
a
thesis
statement
was
introduced
and
my
freshman
English
teacher
was
not
going
to
accept
a
mere
retelling
of
the
plot.
For
the
first
few
essays,
I
simply
regurgitated
the
narratives,
adding
very
little
of
my
own
opinions.
Literary
analysis
was
a
foreign
concept
to
me.
It
wasnut
until
I
sat
down
with
my
mom
one
night
to
edit
a
paper
on
the
themes
of
love
in
Romeo
and
Juliet
that
something
finally
clicked.
My
mom
had
always
taken
an
active
role
in
my
schoolwork,
which
was
fine,
until
freshman
English.
Both
grammar
and
analysis
mattered,
and
I
was
lacking
in
each
of
those
skills.
As
we
sat
at
the
dining
room
table
that
night,
she
incredulously
asked
my
why
I
simply
restated
the
plot.
I
told
her
that
I
didnut
know
anything
about
love.
Bad
move.
She
went
off
on
what
a
loving
family
she
had
built,
etc.,
etc.
But
more
importantly,
she
said
the
one
word
that
clicked:
insight.
I
needed
to
look
at
the
book,
and
write
down
something
more
than
the
story.
I
needed
to
take
Shakespeareus
words
and
look
inside
of
them
to
pull
out
an
original
idea.
And
for
some
reason,
that
one
word
p
insight
p
stuck
and
I
was
fine
in
English
classes
from
there
on
out.
My
mom
also
greatly
improved
my
editing
skills,
forcing
me
to
read
my
sentences
out
loud.
If
I
took
a
breath,
chances
were
I
needed
a
comma
there.
And
if
I
got
tired
mid-sentence,
it
was
probably
a
run-on.
Although
those
editing
sessions
with
my
mom
may
have
been
painful
at
the
time,
they
proved
invaluable
in
the
long-run.
My
high
school
writing
was
both
aided
and
hindered
by
the
computer.
I
was
able
to
put
my
thoughts
down
on
a
page
much
quicker,
losing
few
ideas
in
the
process.
However,
my
proofreading
suffered
greatly.
For
some
reason,
when
I
read
over
anything
I
wrote
on
the
computer
screen,
my
eyes
plowed
through
it,
finding
few
mistakes.
The
happy
medium
I
finally
found
was
writing
everything
on
the
computer,
but
then
printing
it
out
and
editing
a
hard
copy
that
I
can
physically
put
correction
marks
on.
My
progression
of
writing
throughout
high
school
(what
I
consider
to
be
the
most
influential
four
years
of
my
rliterary
historys)
was
clearly
defined
and
broken
up
into
four
separate
categories
for
each
of
the
four
years:
analysis,
grammar
and
structure,
the
research
paper,
and
style.
Freshman
year,
I
learned
how
to
analyze
books,
providing
the
rinsightu
my
teacher
was
looking
for.
I
also
learned
the
fundamentals
of
a
research
paper.
Sophomore
year
required
everything
from
its
predecessor,
but
now
demanded
a
command
of
the
English
language
itself.
Comma
splices
were
no
longer
allowed,
and
a
missing
comma
was
deemed
even
worse.
I
spent
countless
class
periods
trudging
through
grammar
worksheets
and
vocabulary
books.
The
importance
of
a
thesis
statement
was
also
drilled
into
my
brain
like
a
biblical
commandment
p
thou
shalt
not
stray
from
thy
thesis
statement.
Junior
year
came
with
its
infamous
teacher
and
its
even
more
dreaded
thesis
project.
The
first
half
of
the
year
was
spent
trying
to
please
Mrs.
Del
Negro
by
finding
the
one
sentence
from
each
novel
that
rdefined
the
book.s
The
latter
half
of
the
year
was
dedicated
to
a
large
research
paper
complete
with
personal
interviews,
several
drafts,
and
a
lengthy
final
presentation.
I
chose
the
Watergate
scandal
as
my
topic,
following
the
progression
(regression
might
be
a
better
word)
of
Richard
Nixonus
illegal
activities
to
their
culmination
in
the
Watergate
cover-up.
I
quickly
learned
how
to
use
the
index
of
non-fiction
books,
most
of
which
were
written
by
retired,
dry
politicians.
One
hundred
and
fifty
note
cards
later,
I
began
writing.
It
was
a
hard
lesson
in
the
need
for
an
outline
if
you
wanted
any
hope
of
following
your
thesis
statement.
The
final
product
was
almost
thirty
pages,
and
while
it
did
not
include
anything
earth-shattering
concerning
the
scandal,
it
still
stands
as
one
of
my
finest
pieces
of
writing.
But
as
much
as
I
learned
in
the
first
three
years
of
high
school,
I
only
truly
learned
to
write
in
my
senior
year.
Skirting
around
the
literary
component
of
the
AP
Literature
class,
my
teacher
was
determined
to
teach
us
style.
The
five
paragraph
paper
was
off
limits,
replaced
by
more
creative
structures.
Any
background
information
became
taboo.
He
was
more
concerned
with
our
original
thoughts
and
how
we
presented
those
words
across
a
page.
He
demanded
the
use
of
the
active
voice,
pleading
with
us
to
find
rstrong
verbs.s
Looking
back
on
several
pieces
of
my
writing,
I
finally
put
everything
together
for
my
college
essay.
It
was
a
simple
piece
on
running,
but
it
was
something
about
the
words
I
used,
my
teacherus
strong
verbs,
that
when
strung
together,
made
up
the
finest
piece
of
writing
Iuve
ever
done.
My
college
essay
was
the
last
plateau
I
needed
to
reach.
And
I
reached
it
just
in
time.
When
I
arrived
at
Lafayette,
I
found
myself
overly
prepared
for
the
first
year
seminarus
requirements.
Ten
page
research
papers
suddenly
seemed
easy.
I
was
allowed
to
show
off
a
little
in
history
class
response
journals.
The
only
negative
experience
Iuve
had
with
writing
at
Lafayette
was
a
rgroup
paper.s
Personally,
I
believe
the
project
was
the
worst
idea
ever,
because
writing
is
personal.
My
group
split
the
paper
into
three
seemingly
equal
parts.
When
we
went
to
put
the
whole
piece
together,
though,
I
realized
that
my
two
partners
needed
an
intensive
course
in
grammar
and
the
structure
of
paragraphs.
Neither
could
use
a
comma
properly,
and
one
partner
had
some
of
the
most
sprawling,
disorganized
paragraphs
Iuve
ever
seen.
But
aside
from
that
one
group
task,
I
enjoy
almost
every
writing
assignment
now,
and
will
always
prefer
a
final
paper
to
an
exam.
