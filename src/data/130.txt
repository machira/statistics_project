Literacy
Narrative
Experiencing
challenges
and
changes
in
my
writing
was
a
marked
characteristic
of
my
first
year
as
a
writing
associate.
Not
only
was
I
confronted
by
my
own
professors
to
search
out
different
writing
styles,
but
more
pronounced
was
my
own
pressure
to
accept
and
utilize
the
writing
styles
of
my
WA
students.
I
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
my
position
as
a
writing
associate
and
be
open
to
other
student's
ideas,
but
as
a
result
of
my
relatively
fixed
writing
habits,
I
experienced
difficulty
doing
so.
Only
after
facing
my
challenges
and
seeing
the
success
of
my
students
did
I
experiment
with
new
writing
styles.
The
majority
of
the
difficulty
that
I
faced,
in
my
fall
semester,
stemmed
from
the
students
who
I
worked
with
in
the
comprehensive
writing
program.
I
was
met
with
a
plethora
of
new
ideas
and
questions
with
which
I
was
expected
to
have
opinions
about
and
answers
for.
It
occurred
to
me
then
that
the
students
in
the
FYS
class
had
a
lot
of
expectations
for
my
performance.
Immediately
I
was
met
with
a
test
in
self-confidence
and
I
began
to
question
my
own
ability
to
write
and
to
give
advice
to
the
students.
My
self-questioning
was
more
pronounced
when
I
was
faced
with
a
student
who
consistently
approached
me
with
papers
that
were
far
more
superior
than
my
own,
both
in
general
style
and
thoroughness.
The
thought
that
maybe
our
roles
should
have
been
reversed
made
me
panic
because
I
had
an
idea
that
WAs
were
supposed
to
be
flawless.
It
was
only
when
I
was
faced
with
well-written
papers
that
I
truly
realized
that
a
WA's
input
and
discussion
with
a
student
is
extremely
valuable.
I
saw
that
writing
can
be
a
mutual
process
between
the
Writing
Associate
and
the
writer.
It
is
easy
to
see
a
WA's
importance
when
working
with
a
student
who
shows
a
lot
of
difficulty
when
writing
because
there
are
numerous
issues
to
discuss.
But,
with
the
outstanding
student,
we
were
able
to
more
deeply
question
issues
in
her
paper
and
fine-tune
it
to
our
best
ability.
Our
conferences
were
more
productive
because
we
were
not
caught
up
in
lower
order
concerns,
but
we
were
able
to
focus
on
more
complex
issues.
From
that
particular
student,
I
realized
that
I
had
the
ability
to
learn
even
though
I
was
the
WA.
I
was
able
to
take
some
of
her
ideas
and
writing
styles,
and
utilize
them
in
my
own
writing
during
the
spring
semester.
Notions
about
how
to
outline
a
paper
and
how
to
approach
an
introduction
were
only
a
few
of
the
tips
that
the
student
was
able
to
give
me.
As
the
semester
progressed,
I
was
faced
with
other
WA
problems
such
as
students
who
depended
on
my
advice
so
much
that
they
blamed
me
for
their
poor
grades.
My
immediate
concern
was
that
some
students
were
getting
bad
grades,
but
the
thought
that
I
may
be
a
factor
in
their
reception
of
bad
grades
was
also
pressing.
After
a
while
of
thinking,
I
realized
that
there
is
a
limited
amount
that
a
WA
can
do
to
help
a
student.
A
WA
does
not
write
the
paper
for
the
student,
but
he
or
she
simply
advises
the
student
and
explores
the
different
avenues
that
can
be
taken
with
the
topic
at
hand.
A
WA's
advice
does
not
guarantee
an
A
paper,
but
the
discussion
that
a
WA
initiates
can
lead
to
a
paper's
improvement.
It
is
important
that
a
student
gets
the
best
grade
possible
on
a
paper,
but
it
is
even
more
important
that
the
student
leaves
the
conference
with
a
better
understanding
of
where
he
or
she
is
going
with
the
paper,
and
that
over
time,
the
student's
writing
improves.
It
is
up
to
the
student
to
follow
through
with
the
ideas
generated
in
the
conference,
not
for
the
WA
to
take
full
responsibility
of
the
paper.
Working
as
a
Writing
Associate
also
brought
about
problems
and
difficulties
with
professors.
For
example,
during
the
fall
semester,
I
encountered
a
professor
who
hardly
ever
returned
my
phone
calls
and
seemed
a
bit
uninterested
in
the
Comprehensive
Writing
Program.
Also,
in
the
spring
semester
one
professor
outright
told
me
that
she
expected
more
from
me
than
any
of
the
other
students
in
the
class
(in
terms
of
writing).
I
agree
that
being
a
WA
requires
a
certain
level
of
writing
skill,
but
the
job
is
not
dependant
on
that
skill
alone.
Therefore,
I
could
not
understand
my
professor's
pressure
that
I
should
have
an
exceptionally
elevated
level
of
writing.
Being
a
WA
did
not
only
improve
my
writing
skills,
but
it
also
improved
my
people
skills.
Other
than
struggling
with
students'
writing
and
papers,
as
a
WA
I
have
encountered
difficulties
with
the
attitudes
of
particular
students.
For
example,
during
the
fall
semester,
I
encountered
a
student
who
missed
numerous
appointments
and
constantly
denounced
the
professor
with
which
he
took
the
class
and
the
comprehensive
writing
program.
This
habitual
problem
allowed
me
to
develop
a
skill
in
handling
such
people.
With
respect
to
the
missed
appointments
I
developed
a
more
assertive
personality
and
a
respect
for
my
own
time.
I
learned
that
our
conferences
were
precious
and
that
if
the
student
did
not
want
to
take
advantage
of
the
service
that
was
being
offered
to
him,
then
that
was
his
loss.
When
he
bad-mouthed
the
professor,
I
slightly
related
to
his
problem
while
also
relating
to
the
professor.
This
way,
I
was
able
to
keep
the
student's
confidence
while
I
also
supported
the
professor.
Being
a
writing
associate
was
also
characterized
by
good
experiences.
Through
the
mishaps
and
difficulties
with
students,
I
have
learned
to
utilize
other
WAs
as
sources
of
help
and
information.
Other
WAs
and
students
were
one
resource
that
I
was
never
conscious
of
until
I
got
involved
in
the
Comprehensive
Writing
Program.
The
people
that
I
have
met
extend
further
than
the
writing
program;
they
are
helpful
when
encountering
problems
in
my
own
classes
and
writing,
and
I
can
help
them
when
they
need
assistance.
Through
the
writing
program
I
developed
friendships
with
many
people
and
hold
better
relationships
with
my
fellow
students.
My
job
as
a
writing
associate
also
improved
my
relationship
with
professors
and
my
ability
to
communicate
with
them.
I
have
a
better
understanding
of
where
professors
are
coming
from
and
what
some
are
looking
for
in
their
student's
efforts.
This
skill
also
allowed
me
to
more
easily
communicate
with
my
own
professors
because
I
realized
professor's
time
constraints
and,
therefore,
I
gained
patience.
I
was
once
intimidated
by
some
of
my
professors
and
over
the
past
year
I
battled
my
fear
to
approach
them
with
any
questions
that
I
had.
Being
a
WA
was
also
very
rewarding
because
I
was
able
to
see
the
progress
and
improvement
of
the
students
for
whom
I
was
a
WA.
Students
who
were
once
receiving
poor
grades
on
papers
were
improving
greatly,
which
boosted
my
self-esteem
as
well
as
theirs.
Seeing
substantial
improvement
in
the
students'
writing
laid
to
rest
the
fears
that
I
once
felt
about
the
disappointing
grades
that
some
of
the
other
students
were
obtaining.
Overall,
being
a
Writing
Associate
is
a
rewarding
job.
I
gained
skills
that
stretch
beyond
writing;
the
improvement
of
communication
and
problem
solving
skills
have
played
a
large
part
in
my
experience.
Although
being
a
Writing
Associate
was
very
challenging
and
demanding,
the
acquired
skills
that
I
can
bring
into
the
real
world
are
more
overwhelming.
