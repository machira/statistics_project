Writing
Associate
Paper
The
Positive
Effects
of
Being
a
Writing
Associate
on
My
Growth
As
a
Writer.
My
mother,
who
happens
to
be
a
third
grade
teacher,
always
says
that
teaching
is
the
most
profound
learning
experience
that
a
person
can
encounter.
While
I
always
thought
that
I
knew
what
she
was
trying
to
convey
by
making
that
statement,
it
was
not
until
I
became
a
writing
associate
last
year
that
I
was
able
to
experience
what
she
was
talking
about.
By
attempting
took
look
at
something
in
a
similar
way
as
another
person
and
then
try
to
explain
a
topic
to
them
so
that
they
can
learn
forces
the
individual
who
is
teaching
to
experience
one
the
ultimate
learning
experiences
-
self
reflection
reflection.
Being
a
writing
associate
has
provided
me
with
a
wonderful
opportunity
to
look
at
my
own
writing
practices
and
to
grow
as
a
writer.
For
me,
the
development
of
my
own
writing
methods
exceeded
anything
that
I
could
have
possibly
hoped
to
impart
on
the
writers
that
I
conference
with
as
a
writing
associate
last
year.
I
developed
new
writing
practices,
strengthened
my
personal
methodologies,
and,
most
importantly,
I
enhanced
my
ability
to
read
my
own
writing
critically.
Now
that
I
have
completed
my
first
year
as
a
writing
associate
and
have
had
an
opportunity
to
reflect
on
my
personal
development
as
a
writer
I
cannot
help
but
be
amazed
at
the
impact
that
a
job
that
allows
me
to
help
others
has
had
on
my
own
writing.
This
especially
true
when
I
consider
the
new
challenges
that
I
faced
as
a
writer
while
I
was
simultaneously
learning
how
to
be
a
writing
associate.
The
first
writing
experience
of
my
junior
year
was
very
challenging
because
the
assignment
called
for
a
writing
style
like
nothing
I
had
ever
attempted
before.
Being
the
type
of
person
who
likes
to
work
within
the
constraints
of
the
familiar,
I
was
very
uneasy
about
the
assignment.
The
paper
was
to
be
written
as
if
it
were
a
Supreme
Court
decision.
It
was
to
include
a
majority
and
dissenting
opinion
that
were
to
cover
all
the
relevant
points
and
counter
points
of
the
hypothetical
case.
Plus,
it
was
to
include
an
analization
of
the
legal
merits
of
the
opinions.
Writing
in
this
manner
required
me
to
deconstruct
many
of
the
writing
practices
that
I
had
become
very
comfortable
with
and
to
develop
new
ones
that
would
help
me
address
the
assignment
at
hand.
I
began
by
creating
an
outline
just
like
an
other
paper
I
would
write.
From
that
point
on,
however,
this
paper
was
very
different.
The
tone
of
the
paper
was
a
weird
mix
of
a
conversational
and
a
formal
tone.
I
remember
being
very
uncomfortable
with
part
of
the
writing
experience
in
particular
because
I
felt
uncomfortable
writing
papers
in
a
conversational
tone.
Once
I
began
writing
the
paper
I
was
able
to
turn
my
attention
to
writing
for
the
audience
at
hand
and
at
how
I
was
going
to
organize
my
argument.
This
put
me
at
ease
because
I
consider
one
of
my
strengths
to
be
developing
my
argument.
Struggling
with
some
of
the
basics
in
this
writing
assignment
provided
an
excellent
opportunity
to
focus
on
the
technical
aspects
of
writing
such
as
tone,
audience,
and
organization.
I
had
learned
something
new;
how
to
change
my
tone,
and
I
had
learned
to
focus
even
more
on
the
effects
of
organization
of
my
argument
on
the
paper's
audience.
I
had
no
way
of
knowing
it
at
the
time,
but
this
experience
crystallized
issues
that
I
would
later
discuss
in
many
of
the
writing
conferences
that
followed
closely
on
the
heals
of
this
first
paper.
I
was
extremely
nervous
about
my
first
round
of
conferences
which
were
to
take
place
about
a
week
after
finishing
up
my
first
paper
of
the
semester.
I
wanted
badly
to
be
able
to
help
and
guide
my
class
of
first
year
writers
and
to
have
the
positive
effect
that
my
first
year
writing
associate
had
on
me.
After
reading
the
paper
that
was
to
be
the
subject
of
my
very
first
conference,
my
level
of
nervousness
only
increased.
The
paper
read
like
an
encyclopedia
entry
on
World
War
2
and
I
knew
that
it
would
be
extremely
challenging
to
guide
someone
in
an
attempt
to
make
a
focused,
argumentative
paper
out
of
it.
The
writer
attempted
to
discuss
the
entire
second
World
War
in
5
pages
so
I
knew
that
the
paper
would
have
to
be
virtually
scrapped.
No
one,
succinct
idea
was
ever
developed
nor
was
there
even
an
attempt
at
developing
a
thesis.
Reading
the
paper
made
me
panic
because
I
had
no
idea
where
to
begin.
When
I
met
with
the
writer
I
was
somewhat
relieved
to
learn
that
she
was
aware
that
the
paper
was
not
focused
enough
and
that
she
really
wanted
help
in
developing
a
topic
and
a
thesis.
We
began
by
talking
about
what
she
found
most
interesting
in
the
paper
and
began
from
there.
Essentially,
we
took
one
paragraph
from
her
paper
and
developed
a
thesis
and
an
outline.
I
talked
about
the
general
components
of
a
paper,
such
as
supporting
facts,
a
thesis,
an
introduction,
anaylization.
I
guess
I
was
surprised
that
I
would
have
to
discuss
these
rudimentary
parts
of
the
paper
and
was
frustrated
that
I
did
not
have
time
to
talk
about
more
advanced
topics.
When
she
came
back
two
days
later,
with
an
entirely
new
paper,
to
talk
again
I
felt
like
my
work
as
a
writing
associate
really
made
a
difference.
This
was
a
motivating
factor
for
me
the
rest
of
the
semester.
The
other
conferences
during
the
first
round
proved
to
be
slightly
less
challenging
but
I
still
did
not
know
what
I
was
supposed
to
talk
about
with
these
writers.
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
reading
over
the
papers
the
night
before
my
first
conferences.
While
reading
the
papers
I
was
surprised
to
see
how
many
writers
had
not
developed
a
thesis.
This
seemed
like
such
an
elementary
part
of
writing
a
paper
that
I
really
struggled
with
how
to
approach
the
subject
in
a
helpful
manner
during
the
conferences.
I
decided
that
I
would
try
to
start
a
conversation
about
what
they,
as
the
writer,
were
trying
to
tell
the
reader
of
the
paper.
In
retrospect,
I
think
that
while
the
idea
was
a
good
one
that
I
was
not
overly
successful
at
emphasizing
the
importance
of
a
strong
thesis
when
developing
an
argument.
My
lack
of
success
can
probably
be
attributed
to
dominating
the
conversation
and
not
letting
the
writer
speak
much.
By
dominating
the
conversation,
I
was
essentially
telling
the
writer
what
they
were
thinking
when
they
wrote
their
paper.
My
advise
to
every
first
year
writing
associate
is
to
concentrate
on
talking
less
than
the
writer
in
the
conference
and
focus
on
asking
questions
that
force
the
writer
to
make
the
discovery
them,
self-,
This
will
always
result
in
a
more
beneficial
conference
for
the
writer.
My
very
first
conference
sticks
out
in
my
mind
the
most
because
of
the
challenges
I
realized
I
was
facing
when
I
read
the
paper.
The
paper
read
like
an
encyclopedia
entry
on
World
War
2-
Even
worse,
was
the
fact
that
the
writer
attempted
to
discuss
the
entire
second
World
War
in
5
pages.
No
one,
succinct
idea
was
ever
developed
nor
was
there
an
attempt
at
a
thesis.
Reading
the
paper
made
me
panic
because
I
had
no
idea
where
to
begin.
When
I
met
with
the
writer
I
was
somewhat
relieved
to
learn
that
she
was
aware
that
the
paper
was
not
focused
enough
and
that
she
really
wanted
help
in
developing
an
topic
and
thesis.
We
began
by
talking
about
what
she
found
most
interesting
in
the
paper
and
began
from
there.
Essentially
we
took
one
paragraph
from
her
paper
and
developed
a
thesis
and
an
outline*
I
talked
about
the
general
components
of
a
paper,
such
as
supporting
facts,
a
thesis,
an
introduction,
anaylization.
I
guess
I
was
surprised
that
I
would
have
to
discuss
these
rudimentary
parts
of
the
paper
and
was
frustrated
that
I
could
talk
about
the
effect
of
an
argument
or
organization.
When
she
came
back
two
days
later,
with
an
entirely
new
paper,
to
talk
again
I
felt
like
my
work
as
a
writing
associate
really
made
a
difference.
This
was
a
motivating
factor
for
me
the
rest
of
the
semester.
I
was
able
to
take
a
lot
of
what
I
had
learned
during
the
first
round
of
writing
conferences
and
use
it
to
be
more
effective
and
helpful
the
second
and
third
times
I
met
with
my
FYS
class.
The
first
change
I
made
during
the
writing
conferences
was
I
tried
to
ask
questions
that
were
very
specific.
Instead
of
asking
why
did
you
write
that.?
I
asked,
what
did
you
hope
to
accomplish
by
making
this
argument?
and
why
did
you
place
this
argument
at
this
point
of
the
paper?
,
I
found
that
asking
more
pointed
questions
created
a
more
helpful
conference
because
the
general
questions
often
missed
their
mark
and
allowed
the
writer
to
talk
around
the
issue
at
hand.
Secondly,
I
tried
to
really
focus
on
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
each
writer
individually.
Virtually
every
conference
during
the
first
round
dealt
with
the
same
topic
-developing
a
thesis.
In
the
second
and
third
rounds
I
was
more
comfortable
talking
about
a
wide
variety
of
topics
which
were
almost
always
selected
by
the
writer's
themselves.
Seeing
the
growth
of
every
writer
from
their
first
paper
through
their
third
paper
was
one
of
the
most
rewarding
experience
that
I
have
had
in
my
life.
The
student
who
wrote
the
encyclopedia
like
paper
the
first
time
improved
dramatically
with
each
one
of
her
papers.
She
wanted
to
improve
and
put
the
time
into
doing
so.
Each
time
she
seemed
to
incorporate
what
I
had
talked
with
her
about
the
previous
time
into
her
next
paper.
I
think
that
the
most
rewarding
growth
that
I
saw
throughout
the
semester
though,
came
from
the
student
that
consistently
wrote
the
best
papers
in
the
class.
At
first
I
thought
that
there
would
be
very
little
that
I
could
contribute
to
his
papers
or
that
he
may
not
even
listen
to
what
I
had
to
say.
I
remember
during
the
first
conference
that
he
told
me
that
he
never
rewrote
a
paper
beyond
correcting
his
spelling
and
his
grammar
and
that
he
was
surprised
that
I
was
suggesting
such
a
major
rewrite.
Despite
this,
he
ended
up
working
the
hardest
to
incorporate
new
ideas
into
his
paper
and
seemed
to
really
grasp
the
benefits
that
rewriting
papers
could
be
for
his
papers.
Second
semester
I
participated
in
American
University's
Washington
Semester
program
so,
of
course,
I
was
not
a
writing
associate
for
the
last
half
of
the
year.
I,
however,
was
able
to
use
the
knowledge
I
had
gained
from
being
a
writing
associate
to
help
my
with
my
largest
writing
challenge
to
date
and
to
help
friends
polish
their
papers.
Part
of
my
course
of
study
during
my
semester
in
Washington,
D.C.
was
to
write
a
policy
analysis.
Writing
this
analysis
required
more
research
and
more
organization
than
I
had
ever
needed
before.
I
quickly
drew
upon
what
I
had
learned
from
my
past
writing
experience
and
what
I
had
just
tried
to
emphasize
to
the
writers
in
my
FYS
class.
Even
though
this
was
an
80
page
paper
that
was
to
be
divided
into
chapters
many
of
my
writing
techniques
were
still
applicable
to
this
writing
exercise.
Once
I
started
writing
I
quickly
realized
that
the
length
of
the
paper
was
not
all
that
overwhelming
if
I
reallied
on
my
personal
method
of
writing
papers.
I
developed
a
strong
thesis
and
then
organized
the
individual
chapters
around
the
thesis.
Then
I
attacked
each
chapter
individually.
This
allowed
me
to
remain
focused
on
the
argument
that
I
was
trying
to
make
in
each
chapter
and
how
it
supported
my
thesis.
This
technique
made
for
a
strong
beginning
to
the
writing
process.
Still,
I
was
not
confident
about
the
overall
effectiveness
of
the
argument
because
the
size
of
the
paper
often
made
it
hard
to
stay
focused
on
the
thesis.
To
rectify
this
problem
I
had
a
friend
read
the
paper
chapter
by
chapter
and
ask
me
questions
(just
like
a
writing
associate
would
do).
This
helped
me
remain
focused
and
strengthen
my
arguments.
I
know
that
no
matter
how
good
I
am
at
editing
my
own
papers,
having
an
outside
reader
will
always
strengthen
the
paper.
After
she
read
my
paper
I
went
back
and
edited
it
again.
My
last
revision
resulted
in
my
moving
chapters
around
and
moving
arguments
between
the
chapters
for
maximum
effect.
I
am
immensely
proud
of
this
paper
because
of
the
amount
of
work
that
I
put
in
and
the
results
that
I
was
able
to
obtain
by
using
what
I
had
learned
as
a
WA
and
from
past
writing
experiences.
During
my
semester
away
from
Lafayette
I
also
realized
the
value
of
the
College
Writing
Program
at
Lafayette.
Having
met
and
befriended
many
people
from
schools
all
across
the
country
I
quickly
learned
that
there
was
a
large
gap
between
the
writing
skills
of
many
students
as
a
result
of
the
degree
of
emphasis
placed
on
writing
by
their
home
school.
For
example,
one
friend
who
attends
Texas
A&M
University
had
only
written
a
handful
of
papers
in
her
entire
college
career.
She
had
never
experienced
a
situation
similar
to
writing
conference
where
someone
could
read
her
paper
and
discuss
its
strengths
and
weaknesses
enough
to
make
a
difference.
The
result
was
that
she
was
very
insecure
in
her
writing
and
her
writing
skills
were
not
as
developed
as
they
could
have
been.
I
began
to
read
and
edit
her
papers
throughout
the
semester
as
a
way
to
help
her
develop
writing
skills
to
match
her
speaking
skills.
She
told
me
that
she
had
never
really
considered
the
organization
of
her
papers
and
the
way
that
she
developed
her
arguments
before
and
that
she
was
slowly
seeing
the
benefits
of
thinking
about
these
things
explicitly
in
her
writing.
It
was
this
comment
that
made
me
realize
the
value
of
the
writing
associate
program.
The
College
Writing
Program
definitely
makes
writers
constantly
think
about
how
they
construct
a
paper
and
this
can
only
lead
to
an
improvement
in
a
person's
ability
to
write.
