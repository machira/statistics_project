WA
Writing
Assignment
ItOs
not
easy
being
the
youngest
in
a
family
with
two
older
brothers
doing
things
you
can
only
imagine
doing.
Writing
and
reading
were
two
amazing
things
I
saw
my
brothers
doing.
I
could
only
hope
that
one
day
too
I
could
be
like
them,
writing
sentences
and
reading
Hop
on
Pop.
When
I
was
thinking
about
this
paper
I
looked
at
my
first
artwork.
At
first
my
writing
vaguely
resembled
letters,
but
then
I
saw
that
I
had
written
my
name
and
I
can
only
imagine
the
intense
joy
I
must
have
felt
after
writing
those
five
simple
letters,
writing
my
very
own
name.
My
first
specific
memory
of
the
writing
process
is
from
kindergarten
when
Mrs.
Anderson,
my
teacher,
would
write
down
a
simple
sentence
I
had
dictated.
Each
day
this
sentence
was
a
creative
challenge,
because
each
kindergartener
was
given
a
piece
of
paper
with
a
simple
shape
drawn
on
it
and
would
have
to
create
a
new
picture
by
drawing
more
on
the
paper,
making
the
simple
circle
or
square
into
a
princess
or
a
car
with
an
exciting
accompanying
story.
These
sentences
and
drawings
eventually
became
my
very
own
book,
allowing
me
to
be
able
to
refer
back
to
those
straightforward
sentences
and
see
how
far
my
writing,
as
well
as
my
creativity,
has
expanded
from
those
of
my
six-
year
old
mind.
Creativity
and
story
telling
were
constantly
stressed
in
first
through
third
grades,
with
teachers
encouraging
us
to
tell
our
own
stories
while
we
learned
to
write.
Spelling
became
an
integrated
part
of
our
writing
with
weekly
spelling
tests.
I
would
diligently
study
the
words,
having
my
mom
test
me
to
make
sure
I
was
fully
prepared
for
the
quiz.
Eventually
I
began
learning
such
words
as
Wednesday,
and
even
Mississippi
and
the
rest
of
the
forty-nine
states
(a
skill
of
which
I
was
extremely
proud).
Reading
was
also
highly
stressed
in
my
education
and
I
read
books
from
the
Toad
and
Frog
series
to
Freaky
Friday
in
the
third
grade.
This
inspired
me
to
read
my
all
time
favorite
series
of
that
age
The
Baby
Sitters
Club,
and
to
be
so
proud
when
I
could
tell
my
friends
how
many
of
the
hundreds
of
books
in
the
series
I
had
read.
One
specific
memory
of
writing
is
the
books
we
created
in
third
grade,
a
project
that
was
also
based
on
imaginative
thought.
This
book
required
that
each
student
create
individual
story
about
such
puzzling
topics
as
solving
how
giraffes
got
such
long
necks;
compensation,
I
concluded,
for
a
simple
inability
to
reach
the
trees.
I
believe
Darwin
would
be
particularly
proud
of
this
conclusion
that
just
made
intuitive
sense
to
me.
The
best
part
of
this
project
was
the
fact
that
each
student
got
to
leave
the
third
grade
with
their
own
personal
book,
written
and
illustrated
solely
by
themselves.
Third
grade
was
particularly
exciting
because
that
was
the
year
we
not
only
learned
to
write
in
cursive
script,
but
we
could
finally
write
in
erasable
pens.
No
longer
was
I
writing
in
pencil
like
a
little
kid,
I
could
proudly
chose
between
a
blue
or
black
pen
and
look
down
at
my
work
and
know
I
had
hit
a
huge
milestone
in
my
writing
career.
My
classmates
and
I
spent
hours
forming
the
loops
and
curlicues
in
our
workbooks
and
I
endlessly
practiced
writing
my
name
in
the
new,
exhilarating
script.
Eventually
writing
became
more
demanding,
specifically
in
seventh
grade
when
I
finally
was
in
the
Cresskill
Junior-Senior
High
School
with
all
the
big
kids.
I
was
very
afraid
that
the
work
would
be
too
difficult.
Suddenly
we
were
studying
daunting
Shakespeare
and
were
even
asked
to
write
an
essay
on
Romeo
and
Juliet.
The
Englishman
first
sounded
like
Greek
to
me,
but
eventually
I
learned
to
dissect
his
writing,
and,
surprisingly,
even
found
some
humor
in
his
words.
In
the
seventh
grade
I
became
acquainted
with
a
new
companion,
a
companion
with
whom
I
would
spend
countless
hours:
the
computer.
Suddenly
I
was
learning
typing
and
trying
to
memorize
the
essential
home
row.
Teachers
now
required
most
writing
to
be
done
on
the
computer,
and
my
typing
skills
quickly
improved
as
my
two
finger
typing
took
true
form.
Soon
my
writing
was
integrated
with
information
from
the
World
Wide
Web,
an
enigma
that
no
one
knew
much
of
yet.
However,
eventually,
Google
and
Altavista
became
routine
tools,
and
just
another
step
in
the
researching
and
writing
process.
Ninth
grade
was
the
year
that
my
writing
skills
were
pushed
to
the
next
level.
Mrs.
Alaimo,
a
particularly
demanding
teacher,
critiqued
my
writing,
telling
me
incessantly
how
important
it
was
to
vary
sentence
structure
and
to
prove
my
thesis
concisely.
In
the
beginning
of
the
year
she
nitpicked
about
all
my
sentences.
My
mother,
who
always
proofread
my
writing
for
school
assignments,
preferred
short,
concise
sentences
as
opposed
to
Mrs.
AlaimoOs
complicated
sentences
and,
unfortunately
for
me,
I
seemed
to
have
adopted
my
motherOs
compact
style
of
writing.
Eventually,
after
a
year
of
writing,
I
finally
understood
how
to
place
a
dependent
clause
in
the
beginning
of
a
sentence
and,
suddenly,
I
felt
much
more
confident
in
my
writing.
I
was
proud
of
those
looooooooong
sentences!
My
grammar
skills
had
also
been
challenged
and
improved
through
Mrs.
AlaimoOs
persistent
assistance.
I
finally
knew
how
to
effectively
use
that
confusing
semi-colon
and
colon;
I
used
it
proudly
whenever
possible.
The
biggest
challenge
in
my
writing
that
year
came
when
Mrs.
Alaimo
and
my
history
teacher
decided
to
give
a
joint
term
paper.
I
had
never
written
anything
longer
than
three
pages;
how
would
I
handle
a
seven-paged
paper?
Picking
a
topic
even
daunted
me,
but
finally
I
chose
how
the
Second
World
War
affected
womenOs
lives.
Suddenly
I
was
learning
about
Rosie
the
Riveter
and
the
struggles
and
perseverance
of
women
who
took
on
factory
jobs
never
before
open
to
women,
but
instead
considered
NmenOs
work,O
while
their
husbands
and
brothers
fought
the
war.
Although
the
paper
took
real
effort,
I
finally
found
a
real
interest
and
actually
cared
about
the
topic.
It
became
important
not
just
to
complete
the
paper,
but
to
find
out
about
Rosie
and
the
other
women
who
bravely
stated,
NWe
can
do
it!O
and
proved
that
they
could
break
down
barriers
and
their
causative
binding
stereotypes.
Unfortunately,
I
also
learned
that
once
the
men
returned
from
the
war,
women
were
again
forced
to
stay
in
the
home,
but
I
think
that
the
war
helped
women
to
begin
to
break
the
glass
ceiling
and
take
on
a
wider
range
of
jobs
outside
the
home.
Women
no
longer
were
satisfied
with
staying
at
home
once
they
realized
the
sense
of
fulfillment
they
could
feel
by
pursuing
jobs
of
their
own
outside
the
home.
At
the
end
of
the
year
Mrs.
Alaimo
wrote
me
a
note
that
I
had
broken
down
the
barriers
in
my
writing.
I
felt
it
too.
Finally
I
was
able
to
write
in
a
style
I
was
proud
of,
my
own
personal
style.
In
my
junior
year
of
high
school
a
new
style
of
writing
became
my
new
challenge.
That
year
I
spent
countless
hours
doing
poetry
analyses,
breaking
down
each
word
of
the
poetOs
creation
to
look
for
underlying
meaning
and
depth.
Although
I
still
do
not
claim
to
hold
particular
strength
in
the
poetry
field,
I
did
manage
to
see,
for
example,
how
Robert
Frost
effectively
uses
his
simple
language
to
describe
the
overwhelming
crop
of
apples
and
the
emotional
effects
caused
by
the
influential
apple
crop
in
his
poem
NAfter
Apple
Picking.O
I
learned
to
see
each
simile
and
metaphor
and
understand
what
the
poet
was
trying
to
display
through
his
or
her
precise
diction.
In
my
senior
year
of
high
school
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
again
have
Mrs.
Alaimo
as
my
teacher
for
my
AP
Literature
class.
I
knew
the
year,
and
even
the
summer
before
it
started,
would
be
a
demanding
time,
filled
with
reading
various
novels
and
writing
assorted
types
of
papers
including
persuasive
writings,
creative
pieces,
and,
of
course,
the
inevitable
term
papers.
Sure
enough,
Mrs.
Alaimo
started
off
immediately
with
rigorous
readings.
Mrs.
AlaimoOs
unique
choices
ranged
from
studying
the
wordy
classic
Pride
and
Prejudice,
by
Jane
Austen,
to
John
IrvingOs
story
of
a
distinctive
boyhood
in
A
Prayer
for
Owen
Meany.
Again,
I
was
forced
to
analyze
the
writing
of
the
complex
Shakespeare
in
his
masterpiece
Hamlet.
Suddenly
I
found
myself
dissecting
HamletOs
feelings
towards
women,
concluding
that
his
complex
feelings
of
scorn
towards
women
trigger
his
abuse
of
Ophelia,
while
his
Oedipus
complex
is
hidden
from
his
tragic
soul.
Another
topic
Mrs.
Alaimo
stressed
was
that
of
awakening,
including
sexual
as
in
The
Awakening
and
Tess
of
the
dOUbervilles.
She
concentrated
on
underlining
the
inner
growth
of
both
women
while
they
were
being
forced
to
face
the
ridicule
of
the
judgmental
societies
of
a
specific
period
of
time.
For
Tess
of
the
dOUbervilles
I
enjoyed
exploring,
through
my
writing,
FreudsO
psychological
strategy
that
allows
the
reader
to
examine
unconscious
desires
and
impulses
that
drive
human
characters
to
certain
actions
and
emotions.
Unfortunately
for
Tess,
a
protofeminist,
her
life
was
doomed
to
tragedy,
despite
her
persevering
soul.
Although
we
spent
most
of
our
writing
time
analyzing
pieces
of
writing
for
style,
diction,
and
symbolism
in
order
to
be
prepared
for
the
looming
AP
exam
in
May,
we
were
allowed
time
in
our
year
to
write
creatively.
This
meant
we
would
often
write
poems,
and
even
songs,
that
had
to
be
performed
in
front
of
the
class.
Although
I
did
not
particularly
desire
to
sing
in
front
of
the
class,
what
Mrs.
Alaimo
showed
me
was
that
writing
didnOt
have
to
be
a
chore
forced
upon
oneself,
but
can,
instead,
actually
be
fun.
My
history
and
government
classes
taught
me
yet
a
different
style
of
writing.
For
my
AP
US
History
classes
and
AP
Government
classes
I
learned
to
weave
important
facts
into
a
paper
to
prove
my
thesis.
It
was
always
difficult
to
achieve
the
challenging
correct
balance
of
facts
and
discussion.
This
persuasive
type
of
writing
was
particularly
testing
for
me,
because
often
my
theses
statements
were
not
written
clearly
and
concisely
enough
for
my
teachers.
So
I
spent
much
of
a
year
on
that
one
critical
sentence
that
all
my
teachers
stressed.
Although
I
felt
I
could
write
well
at
the
high
school
level,
the
anticipation
of
college
was
a
whole
other
story!
Visions
of
staying
up
all
night
long
in
the
library
writing
fifty
page
weekly
papers,
desperately
trying
to
throw
in
as
many
long
words
from
the
thesaurus
as
possible,
ran
through
my
head
as
I
thought
about
college
writing.
Imaginary
students
with
glasses
and
pocket
protectors
with
completely
competitive
and
studious
attitudes
intimidated
me,
causing
me
to
question
my
capability
on
the
college
level.
I
had
no
idea
what
I
was
in
for.
The
day
when
my
first
writing
assignment
was
assigned
in
my
First
Year
Seminar
on
the
mystique
of
travel
was
a
daunting
day.
I
was
sure
that
my
professor
was
going
to
assign
the
most
difficult
possible
paper
to
intimidate
us
and
prepare
us
for
the
challenges
to
come
in
the
next
four
years
of
torture.
Much
to
my
surprise,
my
first
writing
assignment
in
college
was
a
pleasurable
and
amusing
project.
Suddenly
I
was
assigned
to
write
about
any
trip
that
I
had
experienced.
My
topic
came
easily
to
me;
I
would
describe
the
eight-hour
car
drive
down
to
the
Outer
Banks
of
North
Carolina,
a
trip
that
my
family
has
taken
every
summer
since
I
was
two
years
old.
Instead
of
researching
for
hours
in
the
overwhelming
library,
I
got
to
relax
and
recount
a
travel
story.
Although
this
was
still
work,
I
enjoyed
just
thinking
and
telling
of
my
familyOs
drive,
from
the
rush
to
pack
and
leave,
to
listening
to
country
music
on
the
radio
and
playing
car
games
like
the
name
game
and
I
Spy.
I
was
able
to
recount
the
joy
I
feel
every
summer
soaking
up
the
sun
and
feeling
the
soothing
sand
bits
on
my
feet.
I
felt
overwhelmingly
happy
when
I
received
an
A
on
the
paper.
Not
only
had
I
enjoyed
writing
the
piece,
but
I
was
satisfied
with
the
result,
reminding
me
of
another
great
thing
about
writing,
the
self-satisfaction
that
results
when
you
have
done
well.
Although
I
did
enjoy
my
writing
assignments
for
my
FYS,
I
did
not
particularly
enjoy
the
style
of
writing
required
for
my
psychology
labs.
I
did
not
like
the
precise
regulations
given
for
the
writing.
It
seemed
that
after
each
sentence
I
would
have
to
turn
to
the
APA
manual
and
make
sure
I
was
following
the
correct
form.
Even
though
I
tried
to
be
very
thorough
in
checking
for
mistakes,
I
undoubtedly
would
make
tiny
errors,
including
forgetting
the
important
comma,
that
would
significantly
alter
my
grades.
I
am
not
much
of
a
detail
person,
but
much
prefer
to
spend
time
concentrating
on
telling
an
amusing
story
and
not
some
dull
research
results
about
crawfish.
Through
practicing
various
forms
of
writing,
I
have
realized
that
I
prefer
opinion
or
free
writing
the
best.
IOve
found
I
enjoy
keeping
a
diary,
telling
of
my
activities
and
reflecting
on
my
thoughts
about
the
day.
The
best
part
about
keeping
a
diary
is
looking
back
and
reading
about
your
earlier
life
at
a
different
stage
of
your
life.
Suddenly
you
feel
youOre
again
in
the
third
grade
worrying
about
things
that
seem
so
trivial
today.
ItOs
a
great
feeling,
most
of
the
time,
to
relive
your
past.
While
thinking
about
my
own
writing,
I
realized
that
writing
is
truly
vital
even
in
todayOs
common
communication.
People
are
writing
e-mails
and
contacting
one
another
through
instant
messaging.
Although
the
style
may
not
be
as
formal
as
a
research
paper,
or
even
an
old-fashioned
letter,
this
writing
in
todayOs
fast
paced
society
is
important.
I
will
just
have
to
be
careful
to
use
the
appropriate
writing
style
in
the
appropriate
situation.
Spelling
will
be
important
in
a
resume,
while
emotional
symbols
will
not
:).
As
I
look
at
the
long
road
my
writing
has
taken
from
my
first
ABCOs
to
essays,
I
can
only
wonder
what
new
things
I
will
learn.
Through
the
writing
associate
program
I
wonder
what
other
styles
I
will
come
across
and
what
I
will
integrate
into
my
own
writing.
It
should
be
an
education
for
both
students
and
me.
