Literacy

When
I
could
pick
up
a
pencil
and
scribble
my
first
wobbly
letters
marked
the
beginning
of
my
intimate
relationship
with
writing.
An
irresistible
fascination
seized
me
as
I
discovered
that
I
could
pave
an
endless
road
of
expression
with
just
a
pencil
and
a
piece
of
paper.
The
more
I
wrote,
the
more
I
discovered
the
diversity
and
complexity
that
a
combination
of
letters
could
produce.
This
adoration
for
writing
branched
out
into
many
forms
for
me,
including
writing
poems,
stories,
and
keeping
a
journal.
Until
school
educated
me
in
the
art
of
writing,
my
work
had
been
rudimentary
and
admittedly
unorganized.
The
only
fences
that
bordered
my
writing
were
the
lines
upon
the
paper;
I
wrote
whatever
idea
materialized
in
my
mind.
Scholarly
writing
enabled
me
to
learn
the
fundamental
characteristics
in
order
to
facilitate
clarification
and
comprehension.
As
the
years
passed
my
schooling
and
my
age
necessitated
maturation
in
my
writing,
which
led
me
to
look
at
writing
in
a
more
business-like
manner.
Yet
I
still
find
that
the
initial
fascination
that
sparked
my
love
for
writing
still
meets
me
at
the
blank
page.
I
am
reminded
about
the
many
paths
my
ideas
could
take,
though
I
now
have
the
tools
to
effectively
navigate
the
best
road.
I
contribute
this
adoration
for
writing
to
my
interest
in
reading;
from
it
I
learned
to
recognize
a
magnitude
of
variety
in
writing,
whether
creatively
or
scholarly.
Like
my
first
time
writing,
my
first
time
reading
planted
a
seed
of
fervor
for
the
magic
of
words.
As
a
child
I
grabbed
the
nearest
book
and
would
spend
an
entire
day
pouring
over
the
pages.
The
books
that
I
read
populated
my
imaginary
world
with
fantastic
scenery
and
fascinating
people.
As
that
seed
continued
to
grow
I
began
filtering
the
material
that
watered
it,
opting
for
novels
like
Pride
and
Prejudice
and
To
Kill
A
Mockingbird.
Novels
like
these
attracted
me
with
their
expert
yet
artistic
syntax.
Coupled
with
the
elevated
vocabulary
these
authors
employed,
an
additional
love
for
unique
and
sophisticated
words
sprouted
within
me.
These
classics
exposed
me
to
a
refined
writing
structure
and
it
has
always
been
an
aspect
of
reading
that
has
inspired
how
I
write.
I
have
tried
to
expose
myself
to
several
different
styles
in
hopes
to
become
better
acquainted
with
effective
writing.
My
love
of
both
reading
and
words
inspired
me
to
pursue
my
own
creative
writing
career.
I
began
early
in
my
life
by
writing
about
subjects
that
intrigued
me.
Several
notebooks
held
and
still
hold
many
of
my
ideas
captive
in
a
jumbled
array
of
sentences.
I
wrote
down
an
interesting
phrase,
story
idea,
or
even
a
drawing
into
those
notebooks
at
the
time
I
thought
of
them.
Three
of
those
ideas
were
molded
into
separate
NnovelsO
that
I
wrote
when
I
was
around
eight
or
nine.
Each
described
the
journey
of
a
young
girl
who
either
needed
to
solve
a
mystery,
survive
a
hurricane,
or
manage
pressure
all
the
while
dealing
with
relationships
and
life.
Writing
those
stories
exposed
me
to
a
new
genre
of
happiness.
I
found
such
delight
in
stringing
together
words
of
phrases
into
a
cohesive,
albeit
childish,
necklace.
Although
I
was
proud
of
my
work,
I
never
shared
these
novels
of
mine
with
family
or
friends;
the
fear
of
criticism
crept
up
inside
me
and
postponed
their
debuts
indefinitely.
I
never
showed
my
little
musings
to
anyone
for
I
was
nervous
about
how
people
were
going
to
accept
them.
School
provided
me
an
outlet
to
overcome
my
fear
of
criticism
and
gently
expose
my
writing
to
the
rest
of
the
world.
Such
courage
to
show
my
work
arose
in
me
when
I
remarked
that
if
other
classmates
could
brave
the
reactions,
then
I
could
as
well.
In
elementary
school
I
wrote
two
stories
for
our
literary
magazine,
a
tradition
I
continued
in
high
school
and
expanded
to
include
poems
as
well.
I
would
only
send
in
a
few
entries
though;
I
was
not
ready
to
share
everything
that
I
had
written.
Sometimes,
I
elicited
my
motherOs
opinion
when
I
entered
creative
work
for
school.
I
once
showed
her
a
poem
that
I
had
written
for
my
seventh
grade
yearbook
poetry
contest;
she
thought
it
was
Nmature.N
Teachers
also
occasionally
made
their
opinions
known
when
they
assigned
creative
writing
assignments
for
school.
One
day
my
eighth
grade
English
teacher
required
my
class
to
write
a
few
sentences
about
an
old
man
who
had
lost
something,
yet
we
were
not
allowed
to
mention
him
or
that
he
had
lost
something.
The
sentences
I
wrote
impressed
my
teacher
so
much
so
that
a
few
days
later
when
a
woman
came
in
to
observe
her
class,
she
had
me
read
my
work
aloud
as
an
example
of
her
classOs
creativity.
Whenever
I
set
out
to
write
anything,
whether
a
school
assignment
or
a
poem,
I
want
to
distinguish
my
work
to
be
original
and
offer
a
new
perspective
in
my
writing.
I
take
the
road
less
traveled;
this
inherent
need
to
display
my
ideas
in
such
a
manner
defines
my
writing.
Through
creative
writing,
I
can
come
up
with
literary
attributes
that
could
possibly
translate
to
a
history
or
science
paper.
I
try
to
blend
apathetic
facts
with
descriptive
emotion.
Not
only
does
it
connect
the
reader
to
my
work,
it
becomes
an
enjoyable
experience
for
me
as
well.
Creative
writing
is
essentially
the
basis
for
all
of
my
work.
I
want
to
elucidate
my
ideas
as
clearly
as
a
glass
pane
after
a
good
cleaning.
It
has
such
influence
over
me
that
I
cannot
possibly
write
a
paper
without
considering
alternative
approaches
to
descriptions.
Unfortunately,
it
sometimes
leads
me
to
stress
out
over
the
originality
of
my
work:
I
cannot
accept
an
average
paper.
The
amount
of
time
I
spend
editing
my
work
may
exceed
the
amount
I
expend
writing
it.
I
find
that
keeping
a
journal
allows
me
to
experiment
with
writing
in
a
more
relaxed,
personal
way.
I
first
started
a
journal
when
I
was
ten
with
the
intent
to
record
my
life.
I
thought
my
first
journal
was
so
cool:
it
had
a
cow
on
the
front
of
it
and
black
pages
that
I
could
use
my
new
Milky
Pens
on.
Besides
terrible
penmanship,
my
journal
contained
a
basic
list
of
my
dayOs
activities
and
how
I
felt
about
them.
Often
I
would
write
in
all
caps
or
italics
for
emphasis.
At
times
it
seemed
as
though
I
would
be
stuck
using
primer
language
when
I
wrote
about
my
day.
A
sentence
of
mine
would
feature
a
subject,
some
nouns
and
a
verb
and,
on
rare
occasions,
a
conjunction
that
joined
two
independent
clauses.
Having
a
journal
then
morphed
into
an
exposition
on
the
evolution
of
my
writing.
By
the
time
I
was
thirteen
I
started
to
notice
a
difference
in
my
style.
I
began
using
more
complicated
syntax
and
elevated
vocabulary;
a
result
of
my
education,
I
am
sure.
Today,
because
I
still
do
keep
a
daily
journal,
I
am
amazed
at
the
polarity
between
my
first
journal
and
my
current
one.
As
I
reflect
on
it
now,
my
reasons
for
continuing
to
write
in
one
have
changed
into
the
desire
to
know
myself
better.
ThatOs
why
I
have
stopped
calling
it
a
journal.
It
is
now
known
as
a
recorder
of
thoughts,
dreams,
and
opinions,
anything
but
a
juvenile
list
of
my
dayOs
activities.
It
has
immense
influence
over
me
as
a
writer
because
it
allows
me
to
express
myself.
The
feelings
that
entertain
my
heart
can
entertain
an
impartial
party
of
paper.
I
can
articulate
those
feelings
as
loopy
as
a
tied
shoestring
one
day
and
as
sophisticated
as
a
science
paper
another
without
anything
or
anyone
influencing
it.
This
has
allowed
me
to
experiment
with
different
types
of
styles.
I
like
to
test
out
phrases
or
ideas
in
my
recorder
of
thoughts
and
see
how
they
live
in
the
environment.
It
has
become
an
integral
part
of
my
writing
because
it
is
in
there
that
I
experience
the
most
freedom
with
my
writing.
As
I
explored
avenues
of
artistic
expression
in
my
free
time,
I
was
also
learning
the
necessary
foundations
of
writing
during
school.
My
elementary
teachers
focused
on
the
basics:
structure
and
comprehension.
That
was
easy
enough;
yet
as
I
grew
older,
the
demands
from
my
teachers
grew
more
complex.
Instead
of
just
writing
whatever
came
to
my
head,
I
needed
to
execute
certain
requirements
first,
which
included
focus
and
argument,
among
others.
I
had
encountered
a
new
formula
that
required
my
writing
to
acclimate
to
thesis
statements
and
factual
evidence.
School
challenged
my
writing,
seemingly
chaining
it
to
specificity
that
I
had
not
dealt
with
before.
This
became
especially
difficult
in
my
science
and
history
classes,
as
creativity
acted
out
only
a
small
role
next
to
research
and
analysis.
My
AP
U.S.
history
class
challenged
my
writing
significantly.
In
preparation
for
the
AP
test,
my
teacher
assigned
us
document-based
and
free-based
question
essays
almost
every
week.
Our
goal
for
every
one
was
to
develop
a
thesis
statement
and
prove
it
within
five
to
seven
paragraphs.
Often
I
abandoned
creativity
and
instead
spent
my
entire
essay
throwing
down
facts.
In
the
beginning
my
essays
suffered
from
poor
transitions
and
lack
of
focus;
my
hurried
determination
to
remember
the
lessons
I
learned
in
class
disrupted
the
balance
between
style
and
proving
my
point.
My
grades
were
not
bad
at
all,
but
the
essays
did
not
meet
my
standard;
I
decided
that
with
each
essay
I
should
try
to
improve
my
writing.
My
essays
started
to
win
my
approval
and
I
managed
to
do
quite
well
on
my
AP
exam.
Other
classes
of
mine
did
not
build
such
walls
for
me
to
overcome.
Generally
my
work
impressed
my
teachers
and
students
often
came
to
me
for
help
with
their
own
writing.
I
just
found
that
I
needed
to
adequately
maintain
equilibrium
with
my
imagination
and
the
scholarly
guidelines
set
for
me.
I
always
envisioned
that
as
soon
as
I
entered
college,
I
would
adapt
to
the
intellectual
environment
and
instantaneously
produce
sophisticated
papers.
My
primary
school
education,
accompanied
with
my
personal
drive
for
success,
had
prepared
me
for
such
an
immediate
transition
in
my
mind.
In
reality,
the
progress
did
not
go
as
quickly
as
my
assumption
predicted.
My
journey
had
to
advance
much
further
before
I
could,
as
Bartholomae
stated
it,
Ninvent
the
university.O
My
first
experience
with
college
writing
occurred
in
my
first
year
seminar.
The
topics
of
my
papers
centered
on
science,
to
my
displeasure.
I
remember
that
the
first
paper
turned
into
a
nightmare
when
I
tried
to
look
up
facts
about
transportation
and
quantum
mechanics
and
wondered
how
I
could
inject
creativity
into
them.
Fortunately,
my
writing
associate
aided
me
in
creating
a
harmony
in
my
paper,
as
well
as
pointing
out
some
flaws.
With
his
help
I
discovered
that
I
had
an
overactive
comma
disorder
and
occasional
fainting
spells
into
passive
voice.
Another
WA
helped
me
strengthen
my
argument
for
an
English
paper.
With
the
help
of
the
writing
associates,
along
with
my
education
and
my
professors,
I
managed
to
attain
the
grades
I
wanted
and
eased
into
the
college
writing
experience
without
wanting
to
question
my
qualifications
as
a
writer.
One
of
the
biggest
problems
that
my
college
classes
have
highlighted
is
my
need
to
inject
creativity
in
my
writing.
Because
I
love
words
so
much,
I
always
try
to
incorporate
a
fascinating
word
to
come
up
with
a
new,
different
way
to
describe
a
thought.
Sometimes
that
leads
me
to
error
in
that
my
point
becomes
lost
in
a
fog
of
synonyms.
Other
times
my
stubbornness
to
maintain
variety
hyperbolizes
a
paper
and
produces
the
opposite
desired
effect.
As
a
result
my
professors
commented
about
word
choice
and
ambiguity
when
grading
my
work.
In
my
spring
semester
English
205
class
I
had
written
a
paper
about
JoyceOs
A
Potrait
of
an
Artist
as
a
Young
Man.
The
professor
riddled
my
paper
with
the
same
comments,
Nword
choiceO
and
Nneed
to
clarify
here.O
I
have
struggled
with
maintaining
a
balance
between
a
distinctive
voice
and
a
professional
tone.
This
problem
became
especially
difficult
when
I
began
writing
lab
reports
for
my
psychology
lab
my
spring
semester.
It
pained
me
to
use
the
same
words
over
and
over
again,
yet
there
really
was
no
other
way
to
illustrate
response
time
to
a
stimulus
without
repetition.
Rules
and
structure
again
confined
my
creativity.
Though
as
much
as
recycling
phrases
and
words
bothered
me,
I
realized
that
sometimes
it
is
best
to
reuse
them
to
ensure
clarity.
My
road
to
becoming
the
writer
I
am
today
has
been
the
site
of
many
battles
between
my
wild
creativity
and
my
stern
education.
Each
yearns
for
domination
over
the
words
that
inhabit
the
blank
page.
On
more
than
one
occasion
the
outcome
results
in
a
Pyrrhic
victory
for
one
side.
I
will
continue
to
struggle
with
maintaining
that
balance
between
imaginative
exploration
and
explicit
rules,
for
the
desire
to
revitalize
a
paper
with
a
thesaurus
at
my
side
will
tempt
me
as
long
as
I
continue
to
write.
This
I
cannot
avoid;
but
I
can
learn
to
tame
the
urges
for
the
sake
of
a
sane
paper.
In
some
respect,
I
am
still
at
the
beginning
of
my
journey
as
a
writer,
just
at
a
different
mile
marker.
I
enter
a
new
phase
with
more
intricate
goals
and
erudite
audiences
that
require
time,
practice
and
plenty
of
patience.
As
I
cultivate
my
writing,
I
will
discover
techniques
that
unify
my
artistry
and
conventions
into
sophisticated
comprehension.
