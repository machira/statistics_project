Literacy
Narrative
1999
Thesis,
Etc.
I
can
remember
writing
this
piece
last
year.
I
discussed
writing
across
different
disciplines,
the
very
particular
style
required
for
my
psychology
lab
reports,
my
perplexing
experiences
as
a
WA
for
two
difficult
professors,
and
the
ridiculous
assignment
one
of
those
professors
assigned.
As
I
embark
upon
this
year's
version,
I
can't
help
thinking
it
will
be
less
entertaining.
Whoa,
that's
not
a
good
way
to
start!
Not
exactly
drawing
the
reader
in,
am
I?
Nonetheless,
I
must
work
with
the
facts
as
they
stand.
My
WA
appointments
were
not
unusual
at
all,
allowing
me
to
act
like
a
normal
WA.
On
the
other
hand,
my
academic
writing
did
produce
some
challenges,
such
as
the
lengthy
proposal
for
my
honors
thesis.
If
nothing
else,
I
should
be
able
to
write
about
what
it
was
like
to
write
that
much.
As
I
said,
my
life
as
a
WA
changed
substantially
this
year
only
in
that
I
was
able
to
behave
the
way
most
WAs
do,
which
was
quite
a
relief.
Both
of
the
professors
I
worked
with
were
easy
to
talk
to
and
eager
to
make
things
comfortable
for
me.
(I
hope
that
is
true
for
most
WP.s.)
I
had
the
standard
number
of
conferences,
with
essentially
standard
assignments.
As
with
almost
any
assignment,
they
each
had
their
own
special
problems
and
ambiguities,
but
none
even
approached
the
difficulties
I
had
faced
in
my
first
year
as
a
WA.
Statistically
speaking,
I
suppose
it
was
inevitable;
after
WAing
for
a
60-page
paper
written
in
teams
of
3
and
working
with
a
professor
who
was
only
on
campus
one
day
a
week,
I
was
due
for
some
regression
to
the
mean.
I
did
have
a
few
particularly
positive
experiences
this
year
as
a
WA.
In
the
fall
semester,
one
of
my
students
was
from
France.
Although
he
spoke
.English
fairly
well,
his
writing
definitely
needed
some
attention.
Also,
sometimes
words
would
come
up
that
he
wasn't
using
quite
correctly,
or
that
needed
to
be
clarified
or
removed.
I
found
it
difficult
to
explain
to
him
some
of
the
concepts
that
we
usually
take
for
granted,
but
was
rewarded
substantially
when
I
succeeded.
He
is
an
excellent
student,
so
once
I
was
able
to
express
myself
clearly,
he
understood
perfectly.
(Sort
of
an
ironic
reversal
of
roles
for
a
WA,
but
effective
nonetheless!)
During
my
first
conference
with
this
student,
I
noticed
that
he
was
producing
an
extraordinary
number
of
run-on
sentences.
I
explained
as
best
as
I
could
what
a
run-on
sentence
is,
and
asked
him
to
identify
them
on
his
paper.
He
was
pretty
good
at
locating
them,
but
had
trouble
correcting
them.
So,
I
retrieved
my
trusty
St.
Martin's
Handbook
and
found
a
short
section
explaining
that
ESL
writers,
especially
native
French
speakers,
tend
to
use
a
lot
of
run-on
sentences.
What's
more,
it
even
explained
why.
After
he
read
that,
he
almost
instantly
discovered
how
to
correct
his
errors.
He
also
had
much
fewer
run-ons
in
his
subsequent
papers.
With
some
of
my
other
writers
that
semester,
I
tried
out
a
new
technique
for
conferencinq.
However,
I
was
reminded
throuqh
experience
of
my
own
assertion
that
every
writer
needs
to
be
treated
differently.
The
first
time
I
used
this
method,
it
worked
famously.
The
next
writer
had
similar
problems
with
her
paper,
but
when
I
attempted
what
had
been
successful
before,
the
conference
sputtered
and
died.
Anyway,
here's
what
I
did.
Both
of
these
writers
had
long,
winding
papers
with
lots
of
ideas,
some
good
and
some
bad.
Much
of
what
they
had
written
addressed
the
assignment
adequately,
but
other
sections
clearly
did
not.
With
the
first
writer,
we
quickly
came
to
an
agreement
that
the
organization
of
the
paper
was
the
most
critical
problem.
I
gave
him
some
index
cards
and
asked
him
to
write
down
the
main
idea
of
each
section/paragraph
of
the
paper.
Once
we
had
everything
on
its
own
card,
I
shuffled
them
up,
and
we
put
them
into
a
more
logical
order.
He
even
identified
the
parts
that
didn't
really
fit.
Then,
we
thought
of
ways
to
connect
each
section
to
the
next
one.
He
seemed
really
enthusiastic
about
going
back
to
revise.
Needless
to
say,
I
was
pretty
happy
with
myself
after
the
conference.
I
checked
the
schedule
only
to
see
that
the
next
writer
had
similar
difficulties,
and
prepared
to
use
the
same
tactics.
It
took
some
time
to
settle
the
agenda
with
this
writer;
she
wasn't
convinced
that
the
organization
was
an
issue.
Come
to
think
of
it,
she
didn't
seem
to
see
anything
wrong
with
the
paper.
I
sort
of
pressed
the
issue,
saying
that
we'd
try
a
different
way
of
thinking
about
organization.
Unfortunately,
she
simply
wasn't
interested
in
my
little
exercise.
The
first
writer
had
used
nine
different
index
cards.
This
writer
had
just
as
many
ideas
scattered
around
the
paper
as
he
did,
but
only
used
three
cards.
At
that
point,
it
was
impossible
to
change
the
organization
or
identify
the
parts
that
didn't
belong.
It
just
shows
that
if
you
aren't
careful,
some
conferences
can
be
doomed
from
the
start.
It
doesn't
pay
to
try
to
solve
a
writing
conference
like
a
math
problem.
There
are
simply
too
many
variables!
The
proposal
for
my
honors
thesis
represented
my
biggest
task
as
a
writer
this
year.
For
the
most
part,
it
was
a
long,
comprehensive
literature
review.
Without
a
doubt,
I
learned
a
lot
in
the
course
of
this
past
semester
as
I
read
all
the
journal
articles
that
have
shaped
the
history
of
my
field
of
research.
However,
I
feel
I
learned
even
more
in
the
few
weeks
I
spent
translating
those
works
into
the
introduction
to
my
paper.
Not
only
did
I
have
to
write
about
these
articles;
I
had
to
explain
them
to
a
naive
reader.
In
doing
this,
I
came
to
a
much
fuller
understanding
and
appreciation
for
what
each
experimenter
had
shown,
and
how
it
all
fit
together
to
build
a
sturdy
theoretical
framework
for
research.
Once
I
had
it
all
figured
out,
the
challenge
was
to
express
those
connections
in
the
paper,
while
also
summarizing
just
enough
of
each
experiment
to
reveal
its
method
and
notable
results.
First,
I
had
to
decide
how
much
time
to
spend
on
any
one
article.
Then,
I
needed
to
strike
a
balance
between
merely
reporting
the
experiment
that
was
conducted,
supplying
my
own
commentary
with
regard
to
the
results,
and
using
the
implications
of
each
study
to
set
the
stage
for
the
next
one.
At
the
same
time,
I
had
to
be
careful
not
to
lose
myself
in
the
terminology.
Given
that
my
intended
audience
was
only
other
psychologists,
it
might
seem
as
if
terminology
wouldn't
be
an
issue.
However,
there
are
so
many
different
factions
within
psychology
that
the
common
discourse
is
rather
limited.
In
particular,
many
people
within
the
field
are
unfamiliar
with
the
literature
pertaining
to
my
research.
I
persevered
to
complete
the
introduction,
and
then
proceeded
with
the
method
section
and
a
proposed
analysis
of
the
results.
In
the
end,
I
was
left
with
about
30
pages
of
which
I
could
truly
be
proud.
At
this
point,
the
experiment
I
proposed
is
just
about
finished,
and
all
that
writing
will
hopefully
pave
the
way
for
my
first
academic
publication.
As
I
noted
earlier,
the
rest
of
my
writing
this
year
doesn't
lend
itself
to
a
narrative
very
well.
It
was
a
pretty
normal
year-
some
papers
here
and
there,
a
few
labs,
and
that
was
it.
I
wrote
a
paper
about
the
baseball
renaissance
of
1998
for
American
Studies.
It
was
fun
to
work
on,
but
not
especially
notable
as
a
challenging
writing
assignment
or
major
formative
experience.
I
also
wrote
several
papers
analyzing
music
for
my
jazz
class,
which
was
a
nice
change
of
pace.
As
a
result
of
being
a
writing
associate,
I
have
developed
a
heightened
awareness
of
the
conventional
notion
of
the
writing
process.
I
am
interested
in
whether
the
techniques
we
all
subscribe
to
(brainstorming,
outlining,
rough
drafts,
etc.)
really
generate
stronger
writing.
So,
combining
that
curiosity
with
my
interest
in
psychology,
I
set
out
to
conduct
an
experiment
to
see
whether
one
specific
pre-writing
strategy,
outlining,
is
actually
effective.
In
this
study,
all
participants
will
be
asked
to
write
an
essay.
I
chose
a
deceptive
topic
for
the
essay,
which
should
disguise
my
true
aim
for
conducting
the
experiment.
There
will
be
three
different
sets
of
directions
for
the
writing
task,
corresponding
to
three
different
experimental
conditions.
One
group
of
participants
will
simply
be
told
to
write
the
essay.
A
second
group
will
be
told
to
take
5
minutes
to
write
an
outline
before
they
start
to
write.
Finally,
the
third
group
will
be
reminded
to
take
time
to
organize
their
thoughts
before
they
begin.
My
guess
is
that
pre-writing
strategies
like
outlining
work
because,
without
them,
people
would
never
take
the
time
to
plan
before
they
write.
I
don't
think
it
really
makes
a
difference
whether
you
neatly
organize
your
thoughts
with
letters
and
roman
numerals
or
generate
a
rough
list
of
topics
to
discuss.
As
long
as
there
is
some
sort
of
plan
before
you
write,
it
seems
like
anything
should
suffice.
So,
I'm
hypothesizing
that
the
second
and
third
groups
will
both
perform
about
the
same,
but
the
first
group
won't
do
as
well.
This
should
demonstrate
that
reminding
people
to
plan
is
important,
but
strict
techniques
like
outlining
are
probably
wasted
energy.
I
hope
to
conduct
my
study
this
year.
So,
that's
about
the
extent
of
my
writing
activities
for
the
past
year.
I
look
forward
to
another
year
as
a
WA,
which
will
hopefully
be
as
normal
and
uneventful
as
this
past
year.
Though
great
fodder
for
a
literacy
narrative,
that
first
year
was
not
something
I'd
like
to
relive.
