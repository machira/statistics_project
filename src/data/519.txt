My
experiences
as
a
writer
over
the
past
two
semesters
have
been
vastly
different.
Both
were
new
and
required
different
sets
of
skills,
but
they
shaped
the
way
that
I
look
at
writing
processes
and
also
my
own
identity
as
a
writer,
in
very
different
ways.
During
the
fall
semester,
I
was
immersed
in
my
degree
as
an
English
major,
taking
four
classes
within
the
department,
two
of
them
specifically
focused
on
writing
(creative
writing
and
rhetoric).
In
stark
contrast,
I
spent
my
spring
semester
abroad
in
Madrid,
Spain,
abandoning
English
and
working
only
in
my
second
language.
Whereas
my
first
semester
was
spent
honing
my
skills
as
an
English
speaker,
and
growing
stronger
and
stronger
as
an
advanced
writer
in
the
language,
my
second
semester
was
spent
learning
the
basics
of
another
language,
fumbling
with
grammar,
syntax,
organization
and
facing
problems
that
I
was
never
cognizant
of
in
my
use
of
English.
I
can
best
summarize
the
past
year
as
reaching
the
highest
and
most
skilled
point
as
I
ever
had
as
a
writer
and
speaker
in
English
and
then
beginning
at
the
very
lowest
level
of
communication
in
Spanish.
I
took
on
very
different
roles,
developed
very
different
voices,
created
very
different
strategies
and
faced
very
different
struggles
and
triumphs
within
each
of
the
two
languages.
And
what
was
most
interesting
about
the
contrasting
experiences
was
that
each
helped
me
to
better
understand
the
other
and
use
tools
that
I
had
only
thought
to
use
with
one
language
to
address
problems
I
encountered
in
the
other.
The
English-intensive
portion
of
my
year
(fall
semester)
was
not
the
first
time
that
I
had
taken
on
four
NWO
courses,
but
it
was
the
first
time
that
I
had
done
so
within
the
same
major.
What
I
found
was
that
I
was
doing
more
writing
than
ever
before,
in
terms
of
sheer
quantity
and
was
thinking
about
writing
and
writing
processes
more
than
any
other
semester.
Part
of
this
is
due
to
my
course
scheduleNa
class
in
creative
writing
and
a
class
in
rhetoricNboth
of
which
included
assignments
asking
me
to
explicitly
reflect
on
my
processes
as
a
writer.
It
was
fairly
normal
to
be
writing
more
than
twenty
pages
per
week
for
my
classes
during
the
semester
and
for
much
of
this
to
include
reflection
on
the
writing
that
I
was
turning
in.
As
a
result,
I
became
a
very
quick
writer.
I
was
able
to
create
a
strong
piece
of
work,
edited
and
revised,
in
a
very
short
amount
of
time.
What
I
found
was
the
more
that
I
was
writing,
the
easier
writing
would
become.
Each
of
my
classes
was
reinforcing
the
others,
in
the
sense
that
they
were
helping
me
to
develop
me
efficiency
and
talent
as
a
writer.
But
at
the
same
time,
I
quickly
became
exhausted
by
the
work
that
I
was
doing.
My
classes
required
me
to
do
the
same
type
of
thinking,
analysis,
and
production,
to
the
point
that
I
lost
interest
in
my
work.
Where
I
often
feel
invested
in
my
writing,
I
became
disenchanted
by
writing
when
I
had
too
much
of
it
on
my
plateNor
at
least
too
much
of
the
same
work
on
my
plate.
I
knew
that
reading
Moby
Dick,
would
have
sounded
a
lot
more
interesting
if
I
was
not
reading
Ulysses,
Foucault,
and
writing
my
own
creative
fiction
piece,
at
the
same
time.
I
had
invited
upon
myself
a
literary
overdose
and
what
I
intended
to
be
an
in-depth
immersion
into
a
subject
that
I
loved,
quickly
turned
into
feelings
of
exhaust
towards
my
major.
And
by
the
middle
of
the
semester,
I
was
already
waiting
for
my
courses
to
finish:
not
because
they
werenOt
enjoyable
in
and
of
themselves,
but
because,
paired
with
three
other
English
classes,
I
had
lost
interest
in
all
of
them.
When
the
fall
semester
came
to
a
close,
I
felt
that
I
had
wasted
much
of
my
time.
I
did
not
read
Ulysses
nor
Moby
Dick
in
full,
I
was
disappointed
in
my
final
fiction
piece
for
creative
writing,
I
wished
that
I
understood
Foucoult
better,
and
I
was
struck
that
for
a
student
who
once
felt
very
inspired
by
literature,
I
was
so
tired
of
reading
that
I
craved
facts
to
memorize.
In
all,
I
had
lost
the
feeling
of
wonder
for
English
that
I
embarked
on
my
junior
year
with,
a
feeling
that
had
been
with
me
since
I
first
began
to
read
and
write.
What
I
did
not
realize
as
the
semester
passed,
though,
was
how
good
I
had
become
at
what
I
was
doing.
I
never
stopped
to
reflect
on
the
actual
work
that
I
was
turning
in
or
giving
myself
credit
for
the
quality
and
quantity
of
it.
As
I
look
back
on
the
time
that
I
spent
in
those
four
English
classes,
I
am
struck
by
the
ease
with
which
I
was
writing
twenty
page
papers,
but
also
how
articulate
and
developed
my
work
was.
I
was
sharper
than
ever
as
a
writer
and
editor
but
because
writing
had
become
the
norm
for
me
as
a
student,
I
failed
to
see
the
value
in
what
I
was
doing.
I
am
glad
that
though
the
semester
felt
long
and
tedious,
I
grew
much
stronger
as
a
writer
and
learned
that
the
expression
Ntoo
much
of
a
good
thingO
can
become
a
reality,
even
for
something
that
you
love
deeply.
As
a
knee-jerk
reaction
to
my
fall
semester,
I
decided
to
study
abroad
in
Spain,
leaving
behind
any
trace
of
English
and
taking
on
a
new
language
and
a
new
type
of
academic
work.
I
had
tired
of
delving
so
deeply
within
one
discipline
and
I
was
eager
to
try
something
entirely
new
and
different.
Though
I
had
not
studied
Spanish
since
my
senior
year
in
high
school,
as
I
left
for
Spain
I
felt
very
eager
and
refreshed
by
the
new
course
I
was
charting.
Spain
continues
to
be
the
most
intense,
fertile,
but
also
challenging
experience
of
my
academic
and
personal
history.
It
was
in
Spain
that
I
learned
not
only
another
language,
but
another
culture,
life
philosophy,
cuisine,
history,
academic
culture,
artistic
style,
in
all
una
manera
de
ser
(way
of
being,
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
verb
Nto
beO).
I
felt
in
going
to
Spain
that
I
turned
my
life
inside
out
because
nothing
that
marked
my
daily
patterns
there
looked
anything
like
my
life
in
the
United
States
or
at
Lafayette.
The
experience
was
so
intense
that
for
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
found
myself
unable
to
write
on
any
frequent
basis
about
my
life
because
things
were
happening
so
quickly,
experiences
were
so
fast
and
frequent,
and
change
was
so
rapid,
that
I
did
not
have
enough
quiet
thinking
time
to
digest
what
was
transpiring
around
me.
Spain
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
I
was
not
reading
or
writing
in
English,
and
what
had
been
a
practice
central
to
my
personal
and
academic
life,
was
left
by
the
wayside.
Giving
up
the
freedom
of
expression,
which
was
essentially
how
losing
English
felt,
was
hard
for
someone
who
had
always
been
articulate,
creative,
and
reliant
on
language.
For
the
first
time,
I
found
it
hard
not
only
to
express
myself
in
an
intelligent
or
artistic
way,
but
in
a
most
basic,
communicative
way.
I
unable
to
write
and
could
not
even
explain
to
my
host
family
the
logistics
of
my
day.
Where
I
was
used
seeing
myself
as
a
poet,
philosopher,
and
academic,
in
Spain,
I
became
a
five-year
old
child.
Where
I
was
used
to
expressing
my
feelings,
observations,
and
analyses,
in
Spain,
I
was
only
able
to
express
my
most
basic
needs
and
thoughts.
Without
a
language,
I
had
lost
my
ability
to
communicate
in
meaningful
ways.
And
with
that,
I
also
lost
my
ability
to
think
complex
thoughts.
This
was
perhaps
the
most
frustrating
point
in
my
transition
from
English
to
Spanish:
when
I
knew
that
I
was
working
at
a
much
lower
intellectual
capacity
simply
because
the
tools
of
language
were
not
yet
in
my
hands.
And
I
saw
how
closely
intelligence
and
complex
thought
are
tied
to
oneOs
abilities
with
language,
be
it
a
numerical
or
verbal
language.
What
was
interesting
about
this
experience
of
essentially
inhabiting
the
mind
of
a
five-year
old,
beginning
to
acquire
a
language
and
framework
for
thinking
and
developing
ideas,
was
that
I
had
a
highly
developed
first
language,
English,
to
analyze
and
compare
my
status
in
Spanish
with.
When
I
learned
English
for
the
first
time,
I
did
not
have
the
capacity
to
analyze
my
own
learning
processes
as
I
did
with
Spanish.
In
Spain,
I
could
think
about
what
went
into
learning
a
language,
what
roadblocks
and
strategies
one
develops
in
learning
to
write
at
a
most
basic
level,
and
what
oneOs
thoughts
look
like
at
the
earliest
stages
of
language
development.
What
was
intriguing
to
me
is
that
I
was
able
to
learn
a
new
language
first-hand
while
also
keeping
a
third-person
observational
perspective
on
the
entire
process.
I
was
living
every
cognitive
psychologistOs
dream:
to
inhabit
the
mind
of
a
developing
brain.
My
first
steps
as
a
new
Spanish-speaker
were
not
only
to
widen
my
vocabulary,
but
also
to
learn
how
to
form
grammatically
correct
sentences.
And
I
found
that
this
was
the
biggest
challenge
for
me
as
a
student
in
Spain.
Indeed,
it
was
not
speaking
that
tripped
me
up
in
my
first
weeks
in
class,
but
the
task
of
writing
a
paper.
Mainly
because
it
is
much
easier
to
get
by
speaking
another
language
than
it
is
to
write
in
another
language.
Verbal
communication
is
not
necessarily
bound
by
grammatical
formalities.
For
instance,
while
Tarzan
speaks
an
immature
form
of
English,
we
as
native
speakers
are
still
able
to
understand
him.
In
fact,
much
spoken
communication
ironically
requires
very
few
words.
Body
language,
hand
gestures,
facial
expressions,
and
tone
of
voice
all
play
an
important
role
in
helping
speakers
to
communicate.
And
these
are
all
tools
that
writers
do
not
have
at
their
disposal.
Writers
only
have
paper,
ink,
and
the
words
in
their
vocabulary
that
they
put
on
that
paper.
And
so
while
I
was
able
to
get
by
speaking
Spanish,
I
had
a
very
hard
time
becoming
an
adept,
or
even
proficient,
writer.
My
second
week
in
Spain,
I
had
to
submit
a
fifteen-page
paper.
And
this
first
paper
that
I
wrote
in
Spanish
was
the
easiest.
It
was
also
my
worst.
Riddled
with
errors,
the
paper
was
written
with
some
sense
of
ease
only
because
I
was
unaware
of
how
poorly
I
was
actually
writing.
My
understanding
of
the
language
was
so
base
that
I
was
not
able
to
distinguish
the
poor
grammar
choices
and
incorrect
word
usage
I
was
using.
As
I
turned
in
the
paper,
I
had
no
idea
how
complex
my
understanding
of
Spanish
would
eventually
become
and
how,
months
later,
I
would
reread
that
paper
being
able
to
note
the
mistakes
for
the
very
first
time.
At
these
early
stages,
I
made
a
terrible
editor.
What
changed
over
the
course
of
the
semester
was
that
I
widened,
not
only
my
vocabulary,
but
also
my
understanding
and
use
of
correct
verb
conjugations.
Step
by
step,
I
refined
my
abilities
to
speak
and
also
to
write.
I
would
know
when
I
did
not
know
something,
unlike
when
I
first
arrived
and
I
fired
out
whatever
words
came
to
mind.
The
more
time
that
I
spent
learning,
the
quieter
and
quieter
I
became,
because
I
was
speaking
only
when
I
knew
what
I
had
to
say
made
sense.
The
papers
that
I
had
to
write
in
the
middle
of
the
semester
were
by
far
the
hardest
papers
I
have
ever
had
to
write.
I
was
in
a
place
that
I
could
not
remember
experiencing
as
an
English
speaker.
Aware
of
my
limited
vocabulary
and
all
of
the
mistakes
I
was
making,
my
mind
froze
simply
because
there
was
so
little
I
knew
how
to
say
correctly.
In
the
same
way
that
I
became
a
quieter
and
less
frequent
speaker
the
more
Spanish
I
knew,
I
also
began
to
freeze
up
as
a
writer.
Papers
in
English
had
always
come
with
ease
because
as
soon
as
I
sat
down
in
front
of
my
computer,
the
words
would
simply
start
to
flow
and
that
I
could
read
over
them
afterwards,
refining
what
I
had
written
and
changing
it
into
a
final
product.
But
when
asked
to
write
in
Spanish,
I
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
extreme
writerOs
block.
When
I
sat
down
to
write,
the
words
did
not
flow;
mainly,
because
there
were
no
thoughts.
Again,
I
saw
that
without
a
good
vocabulary
at
my
disposal,
I
was
having
a
harder
developing
any
sort
of
thought
process.
I
could
not
create
sentences
when
I
did
not
have
the
words
to
create
them
with.
And
I
could
not
ask
myself
questions
without
enough
words
to
follow
the
complex
train
of
thoughts
that
it
would
require
to
analyze
and
answer
them.
Additionally
frustrating
was
that
thinking
in
English
and
then
translating
my
words
into
Spanish
was
too
laborious.
As
difficult
as
Spanish
was
for
me
at
that
point,
it
was
easier
to
write
in
basic
Spanish
than
it
was
to
try
to
arrange
my
English
thoughts
and
then
morph
them
into
another
language.
For
any
fluent
speaker
of
both
languages
it
is
clear
that
accurate
translation
is
a
much
more
difficult
process
than
it
might
seem.
I
overcame
my
inability
to
write
by
doing
something
I
had
never
done
in
English.
I
began
to
make
outlines.
Though
my
Spanish
was
not
advanced
enough
to
sit
in
front
of
a
computer
and
let
my
mind
flow
through
what
I
wanted
to
say,
I
was
able
to
make
bullet
lists
of
what
I
knew
I
wanted
to
be
in
my
paper.
Where
in
English,
I
usually
found
some
starting
point
to
springboard
my
paper
off
of,
in
Spanish,
I
had
to
think
about
the
entirety
of
the
piece
because
my
thoughts
could
not
flow
as
transitionally
and
easily
as
they
did
in
my
native
language.
From
these
bullet
lists,
I
would
try
to
come
up
with
topic
sentences
and
under
these
topic
sentences
I
began
to
build
paragraphs.
Essentially,
I
would
arrange
my
topic
sentences
and
then
I
was
able
to
fill
in
the
blanks.
My
inability
to
Ngo
with
the
flowO
of
my
thoughts
meant
that
my
papers
were
much
more
mechanical
and
planned.
This
also
limited
their
complexity.
Planning
out
a
paper
beforehand
kept
me
from
exploring
different
intellectual
tangents
because
I
was
working
within
a
very
rigid
format
that
I
had
set
up
for
myself.
My
language
was
repetitive
as
were
my
grammar
forms,
but
the
important
note
to
make
is
that
not
only
was
I
communicating
through
writing,
I
was
communicating,
more
or
less,
accurately.
The
irony
is
that
the
more
and
more
that
I
learned
about
the
language,
the
harder
writing
became
(because
of
a
new
sense
of
self-awareness).
What
I
reminded
myself
was
that
though
these
later
papers
were
more
difficult
to
write,
they
were
more
also
accurate
than
the
first.
Many
times
I
wished
for
the
naivet
that
I
had
writing
my
first
pages
in
Spanish
but
there
was
also
an
extreme
sense
of
gratification
knowing
that
I
could
look
at
what
I
was
saying
or
writing,
and
know,
with
certainty,
that
it
was
correct.
Indeed,
I
was
becoming
something
of
an
editor.
When
I
left
for
Spain
it
was
with
the
goal
of
becoming
fluent
in
Spanish.
When
I
returned,
I
had
realized
how
much
work
it
actually
takes
to
reach
this
level.
Years
and
years
of
reading
books
and
books
are
necessary
to
acquire
a
full
understanding
of
a
language.
It
is
exposure
to
endless
expressions
and
nuances
within
a
language,
reaching
the
deepest
knowledge
of
a
language
you
can
possibly
have.
There
are
very
few
nooks
and
crannies
of
which
you
are
not
aware.
After
a
semester
in
Spain,
I
saw
that
to
reach
this
level
takes
much
more
than
work,
it
takes
time.
Upon
leaving
Spain,
I
was
able
to
walk
through
the
streets
of
Spain,
conversing
with
natives,
talking
for
hours
with
relatives,
writing
papers
at
the
university
level,
and
even
writing
a
few
poems.
But
I
still
do
not
consider
myself
fluent.
I
have
met
no
Spanish
speaker
here
or
in
Spain
who
questioned
my
ability
to
speak
or
to
understand
them
fully.
But
the
truth
is
there
are
still
words
that
I
do
not
know
and
plenty
of
thoughts
that
I
still
cannot
express
as
eloquently
as
a
native
speaker
might.
People
assume
that
I
know
just
as
much
as
they
do,
but
I
know
better.
I
know
that
as
proficient
as
I
am
in
Spanish,
I
am
not
fluent.
What
I
can
also
say
is
that
it
makes
me
very
proud
that
I
can
recognize
that
I
am
not
fluent.
It
means
I
understand
the
difficulty
it
takes
to
reach
that
point
and
that
I
understand
Spanish
deeply
enough
to
know
what
I
do
not
at
this
point
know.
From
the
outside,
it
is
hard
to
understand
where
exactly
a
person
stands
in
terms
of
their
capacity
for
language
and
writing.
Oftentimes,
we
assume
that
they
are
thinking
on
just
the
same
level
as
we
are,
because
from
what
we
see
and
hear
we
understand
them
perfectly
and
assume
that
they
can
do
the
same
for
us.
In
respect
to
my
work
as
a
WA,
learning
Spanish
has
taught
me
much
about
the
stages
one
moves
through
in
learning
a
language
and
also
that
we
are
all
continually
moving
towards
fluency
and
simply
find
ourselves
at
different
points
along
the
way.
I
think
it
is
important,
as
WAs,
to
look
at
are
students
in
this
way.
Each
is
at
a
different
spot
in
terms
of
their
understanding
of
writing,
their
confidence
as
writers,
and
their
self-awareness
as
editors.
I
see
fluency
as
the
highest
level
of
editing,
of
knowing
exactly
how
the
language
works
and
exactly
how
language
is
best
arranged
to
express
ideas
to
a
large
audience.
Most
writers
are
no
where
near
this
point
and
as
WAs
we
find
ourselves
working
closer
and
closer
to
this
holy
grail.
The
best
we
can
do
is
try
to
understand
the
writer
and
the
stage
that
they
are
in,
understand
the
challenges
they
face
at
that
level,
and
help
them
advance
to
the
next
so
that
their
awareness
and
understanding
of
writing
becomes
stronger
and
stronger.
And
in
many
ways,
this
is
not
necessarily
work
that
we
can
do
for
our
students.
It
is
the
passing
of
time
and
the
continuation
of
writing
that
will
help
them
write
better.
As
a
final
note
about
experiences
with
English
and
Spanish,
I
found
myself
very
nervous
to
see
how
learning
another
language
would
affect
my
proficiency
in
the
other.
I
waited
until
the
very
last
minute
to
write
this
essay,
which
is
not
the
norm
for
me
as
a
writer.
Usually,
I
write
my
papers
at
least
a
week
in
advance
to
give
myself
time
to
think
about,
develop,
and
edit
what
I
put
down
on
paper.
It
usually
makes
me
nervous
to
ask
myself
to
create
a
high-quality
piece
of
work
in
little
time
and
for
that
I
never
leave
my
writing
to
the
last
minute.
But
I
was
so
nervous
about
where
my
skills
as
an
English
writer
would
be
after
being
away
from
it
for
so
long
that
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
sit
down
and
start
writing.
This
essay
is
the
first
assignment
I
have
had
to
write
in
English
since
last
November.
Would
I
be
able
to
pick
up
right
where
I
had
left
off
at
the
end
of
fall
semester,
at
the
peak
of
my
English
game?
Would
I
be
rusty
in
my
own
native
language?
Would
I
have
more
difficulty
drawing
forth
the
vocabulary
that
I
was
used
to
having
at
the
tip
of
my
tongue?
I
worried
that
my
semester
in
Spain
had
degraded
what
I
had
worked
so
hard
to
develop
as
an
English
writer
and
speaker.
But
what
I
found
was
that
English
returned
to
me
with
ease.
Not
only
did
I
remember
all
of
the
vocabulary
that
I
once
had,
but
I
was
also
writing
with
more
precision.
Much
of
this
new
focus
and
cleaner
style
comes
from
what
I
learned
in
Spain.
Through
those
struggles,
writing
in
English
seems
easier
than
ever
and
has
brought
what
I
want
to
say
into
even
clearer
focus.
