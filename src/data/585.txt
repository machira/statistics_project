Both
the
fall
of
2007
and
the
current
year
up
to
the
present
have
proven
to
be
full
of
exciting
experiences
and
adventures
both
here
and
abroad.
I
spent
the
wonderful
fall
of
2007
semester
here
on
campus
at
Lafayette
and
then
hopped
on
a
plane
mid
January
to
spend
almost
four
months
abroad
in
Florence,
Italy.
I
returned
to
the
United
States
for
only
three
weeks
before
jet
setting
off
again
to
the
fantastic
country
of
Egypt
in
northeastern
Africa.
Then,
as
if
I
had
not
had
enough
already,
I
began
a
whirlwind
summer
as
I
started
the
first
of
two
summer
internships
here
in
the
Lehigh
Valley
the
day
after
returning
from
Egypt.
Each
of
these
incredible
experiences
has
taught
me
a
great
deal
about
both
myself
as
a
person
and
as
a
writer
as
well
as
other
cultures
over
the
past
year.
My
first
semester
as
a
Writing
Associate
was
in
the
fall
of
2007
for
a
First
Year
Seminar
class
of
freshmen
students
on
the
topic
of
War
Stories.
I
remember
the
nervous
feeling
I
felt
when
I
first
met
with
my
partner
professor.
I
agreed
to
set
up
a
time
with
him
to
come
into
the
class,
introduce
myself,
and
tell
the
students
a
little
bit
about
what
my
job
involved
as
a
Writing
Associate.
Soon
after
I
sent
around
my
first
WA
sign-up
sheet
the
conferences
were
off
to
a
quick
start.
I
remember
thinking
the
first
thing
I
wanted
to
tell
my
students
was
that
I
was
not
there
to
NcorrectO
their
writing.
I
feel
that
many
students
have
this
huge
misconception
of
WAOsNthat
they
automatically
think
their
own
writing
is
better
and
that
they
try
to
correct
the
NmistakesO
in
the
studentOs
writing.
This
was
certainly
a
challenge
and
a
misunderstanding
that
I
felt
I
had
to
dispel
right
away
during
each
first
meeting.
My
first
round
of
conferences
seemed
to
be
going
really
well.
I
had
already
met
with
fourteen
students
and
each
had
gone
smoothly
until
number
fifteen
failed
to
show
up
for
his
designated
time
slot.
Since
I
had
already
told
the
students
in
their
class
that
day
that
I
would
never
stand
them
up
and
I
expected
that
they
would
do
the
same
since
all
of
our
personal
time
is
valuable,
I
was
surprised
when
this
one
student
did
not
show.
He
not
only
stood
me
up
but
then
when
I
later
expected
to
hear
from
him,
he
did
not
contact
me
afterwards
to
explain
why
he
missed
the
conference
or
even
try
to
set
up
another
one.
The
correspondence
was
all
on
my
end
when
I
contacted
the
professor
and
found
out
that
he
absolutely
requires
all
students
to
meet
with
the
WA
before
handing
in
any
writing
assignment
(not
all
professors
do
this).
Finally
I
met
with
the
student
and
right
away
I
could
sense
his
resistance
to
anything
and
everything
I
was
saying
or
asking.
I
quickly
learned,
as
he
told
me,
that
he
came
from
an
elite
private
school
on
the
west
coast
which
heavily
focused
on
writing
and
that
he
felt
he
did
not
really
need
NhelpO
like
the
other
students.
I
have
to
admit
I
was
pretty
taken
aback
after
this
explanation,
but
I
soon
regained
confidence
in
my
job
to
explain
that
WAOs
are
only
there
to
help
the
students
help
themselves.
I
told
him,
NWAOs
will
never
try
to
write
your
paper
for
you
or
change
your
wordingNthey
will
simply
challenge
you
to
think
Ooutside
the
boxO
and
question
your
techniques
by
encouraging
you
to
think
critically
about
your
writing
and
thus,
improve
it.O
During
the
semester
I
turned
to
a
few
other
Writing
Associates
to
talk
to
them
about
my
experiences
with
my
FYS
class
and
asked
them
how
their
experiences
compared.
I
received
a
lot
of
good
feedback
from
some
of
the
other
WAOs
and
would
always
recommend
the
new
WAOs
to
ask
around
in
the
College
Writing
Program
if
they
have
a
question
or
just
need
some
advice
because
these
exchanges
often
prove
to
be
extremely
helpful.
I
feel
that
working
as
a
Writing
Associate
during
the
Fall
semester
really
helped
me
improve
my
own
personal
writing
by
making
me
challenge
myself
each
time
I
sat
down
to
write
a
piece
for
a
class.
I
also
believe
that
I
became
more
creative
in
my
writing
and
that
my
pieces
became
more
interesting
to
read
just
from
applying
some
of
the
different
discussions
I
had
with
my
FYS
students
to
the
writing
process.
After
overcoming
a
few
obstacles,
but
overall
having
a
great
experience
during
my
first
semester
as
a
WA,
I
began
the
spring
semester
away
from
campus
and
the
College
Writing
Program
in
a
wonderful
foreign
country
where
I
knew
approximately
three
words
of
the
language.
Becoming
acquainted
with
Italy
proved
to
be
a
challenge,
but
what
a
sincerely
beautiful
one
it
was!
The
culture,
the
people,
the
language,
the
customsNeverything
was
different,
although
not
completely
foreign
as
I
had
traveled
there
before
on
family
trips.
Although
everything
was
distinctive,
I
loved
it,
every
single
moment
of
it,
and
fell
completely
in
love
with
the
country
and
its
charming
ways.
I
soon
found
myself
taking
eight
hours
of
Italian
language
class
each
week
and
living
with
a
true
Florentine
family
where
my
Italian
mother
spoke
very
little
English.
My
writing
experiences
during
my
time
spent
in
Italy
were
certainly
formative,
though
ever
challenging
and
they
always
seemed
to
be
critiqued
with
a
red
pen
by
my
Italian
professor.
I
found
myself
writing
entire
compositions
in
this
lovely,
brilliant
language
of
which
I
knew
none
of
a
few
weeks
before
when
I
was
still
in
the
comfort
of
speaking
English
in
the
United
States.
Speaking
a
new
language
that
you
have
never
learned
before
is
one
thingNbut
writing
it,
in
a
grammatically
correct
fashion
with
sentence
structure
intact,
and
so
on,
is
a
whole
different
story.
Working
as
a
Writing
Associate
the
first
semester
of
my
junior
year
taught
me
to
think
more
critically
about
my
own
writing.
I
remember
going
back
to
evaluate
each
piece
of
my
own
writing
after
meeting
with
my
students
during
conferences
and
thinking
of
something
that
I
should
personally
work
on.
However,
in
Italy,
I
was
struggling
enough
to
come
up
with
simple
vocabulary
terms
to
add
to
my
sentence
without
having
to
check
if
my
essay
really
flowed
or
if
I
had
a
strong
thesis.
With
that
being
said,
in
Italy
I
found
myself
writing
more
concisely
than
I
ever
had
before.
I
suppose
I
could
attribute
this
solely
to
the
fact
that
my
knowledge
of
Italian
vocabulary
is
much
smaller
than
that
of
my
native
language.
However,
I
found
myself
almost
establishing
a
new
writing
identityNby
just
stating
what
needed
to
be
stated
without
adding
in
unnecessary
fluff
or
information.
My
Italian
professor
applauded
the
writing
that
I
completed
and
told
me
that
I
had
really
taken
to
the
Italian
language.
Besides
my
Italian
language
class,
I
did
a
lot
of
writing
in
my
NFamily
and
Gender
in
Contemporary
ItalyO
history
class.
I
had
been
hearing
from
other
students
that
this
was
the
professor
that
has
stated
NI
do
not
give
AOs.O
So
I
knew
from
the
start
that
if
any
bit
of
that
was
true,
I
would
have
to
work
extremely
hard
and
come
up
with
my
best
writing
in
order
to
receive
a
respectable
grade.
In
the
beginning,
the
Italian
professor
had
us
submit
different
pieces
of
writing
that
we
had
come
up
with
for
her
to
critiqueNnot
for
a
gradeNbut
for
us
to
see
what
kind
of
quality
she
was
really
looking
for.
For
her,
stating
the
facts
was
not
enough.
She
consistently
asked
the
class
Why?
Why?
Why?
And
How?
How?
How?.....
WHY
were
the
1950s
this
way
and
HOW
did
womenOs
roles
change?
Time
and
again
she
explained
that
we
needed
to
strongly
back
up
our
arguments
and
have
solid
proof.
We
had
to
cite
a
variety
of
sources,
research
a
great
deal,
and
even
interview
our
host
families
in
Italian.
My
experience
in
this
class
is
an
example
of
a
new
expectation
from
a
different
audience.
This
professor
demanded
solid
work
out
of
us
and
did
not
settle
for
anything
lessNshe
would
just
make
us
re-do
the
assignment
if
she
thought
we
were
capable
of
more.
Then
as
if
that
were
not
enough,
we
were
required
to
complete
a
ten
page
written
exam
at
the
end
of
the
course
which
proved
to
be
challenging,
but
interesting
nonetheless.
Besides
my
numerous
writing
experiences
in
Italy,
I
completed
two
very
different
internships
this
summer
that
both
required
a
great
deal
of
writing.
One
of
my
internships
was
in
a
law
firm
in
Bethlehem
and
the
other
was
in
United
States
Senator
Bob
CaseyOs
office
in
Allentown.
As
part
of
my
internship
in
the
law
offices,
I
was
given
a
great
number
of
deposition
testimonies
to
read
over
(some
were
upwards
of
200
pages)
and
was
instructed
to
write
deposition
summaries
on
each
of
them,
picking
out
the
key
points
of
each
testimony-
the
important
pieces
of
information
that
the
attorney
would
need
to
look
back
on
and
refer
to
later
as
the
case
unfolded.
This
kind
of
writing
proved
to
be
a
bit
challenging
since,
as
a
college
student,
I
was
unfamiliar
with
a
lot
of
the
law
terminology
that
a
student
would
learn
if
he/she
was
enrolled
in
law
school.
However,
I
found
the
different
projects
I
was
assigned
to
be
a
welcome
challenge
and
I
really
enjoyed
each
of
the
various
writing
assignments
I
was
given.
In
addition
to
the
law
firm
where
I
interned,
I
also
interned
at
Senator
Bob
CaseyOs
office
in
Allentown.
I
was
also
required
to
do
a
lot
of
writing
in
this
office
as
an
intern.
Each
day
I
wrote
numerous
lettersNanything
from
grant
support
letters
for
grants
that
different
organizations
were
applying
for,
to
congratulatory
letters
for
people
winning
prestigious
awards
or
companies
celebrating
100
year
anniversaries
or
boys
in
the
community
receiving
the
rank
of
Eagle
Scout,
to
event
summaries
of
all
the
meetings
and
events
I
attended
with
the
staff
in
the
office.
Again,
each
of
these
writing
experiences
proved
to
be
challenging
as
I
had
never
written
a
grant
support
letter
or
formal
congratulatory
letter
before
and
had
to
learn
a
specific
type
of
formal
political
writing.
Before
I
even
started
each
grant
letter
I
had
to
call
places
like
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Department
of
Environmental
Protection
in
Washington,
D.C.
to
find
out
whom
to
address
and
send
the
letters
to
so
that
they
are
reviewed
by
the
right
people.
Both
of
these
summer
experiences
definitely
broadened
my
writing
horizons
as
I
was
forced
(in
a
good
way)
to
tweak
my
writing
as
needed
whether
it
was
in
a
law
environment
or
a
political
one.
My
writing
also
became
very
public
as
it
was
reviewed
and
critiqued
by
a
lot
of
different
senior
people.
Now
as
I
return
to
LafayetteOs
campus
and
prepare
for
this
new
academic
year
for
my
final
two
semesters
I
find
myself
feeling
extremely
excited
to
take
on
the
job
of
a
Writing
Associate
once
again
and
meet
a
whole
new
class
of
students.
Through
these
experiences
with
writing
that
I
have
had
over
the
last
year,
I
feel
that
I
am
better
prepared
to
once
again
take
on
this
challenge
and
hopefully
help
another
class
of
eager-to-learn
students
help
themselves.
Though
I
know
that
I
still
have
a
great
deal
to
learn
myself,
as
we
can
never
really
stop
learning
and
can
always
benefit
from
othersO
experiences
and
advice,
if
I
could
share
anything
with
the
new
Writing
Associates,
it
would
be
this:
It
is
okay
to
feel
intimidated
and
nervous
at
first.
I
believe
that
every
new
Writing
Associate
and
even
veteran
WAOs
experience
this
feeling
as
well
and
it
tends
to
fade
with
each
conference
that
you
successfully
complete.
Remember,
you
were
chosen
out
of
a
lot
of
other
hard-working
students
by
a
group
of
intelligent,
demanding
professors
to
do
this
job,
so
you
DO
deserve
to
be
a
part
of
the
CWP
doing
itNdo
not
doubt
yourself
and
your
abilities.
Also
do
not
feel
that
you
are
at
a
disadvantage
if
you
are
not
an
English
major,
this
is
certainly
no
requirement
and
the
CWP
benefits
from
having
students
of
all
majorsE.some
of
the
best
writers
I
know
are
Geologists
and
Engineers.
Do
not
be
afraid
to
ask
your
fellow
WAOs
for
advice,
they
are
the
kind
of
people
that
would
just
love
to
help
you
and
make
you
feel
at
home
in
the
College
Writing
Program---
and
one
last
thing,
have
fun
with
your
students
and
conferencesE
get
to
know
the
students
and
tell
them
some
things
about
yourselfNthis
kind
of
relationship
outside
just
the
writing/student
one
will
actually
really
help
both
of
you
help
each
other
in
the
long
run.
