"Writing
Like
A
WA"
Although
it's
"not
required,"
every
professor
will
"highly
recommend
and
encourage"
that
a
student
meet
with
the
WA
a
fourth
or
fifth
time
to
ensure
a
WA-approved,
right-on
target,
make-the-teacher-proud
kind
of
paper.
What's
so
extraordinary
is
when
the
student
actually
does.
Certainly
last
Spring
was
not
my
first
semester
as
a
Writing
Associate
that
a
student
would
come
to
me
seeking
extra
help.
However
it
was
my
first
semester
where
students
would
come
for
more
than
their
allotted
three
appointments..
.and
come
they
would
in
herds.
One
thing
I've
learned
in
my
four
semesters
as
a
WA
is
never
expect
a
student
to
really
want
to
meet
for
his
or
her
WA
conference.
Let's
face
it,
with
the
hundreds
other
activities
going
on
around
campus,
why
would
a
student
want
to
take
thirty
minutes
out
of
the
day
to
improve
the
quality
of
one
of
the
most
important
and
respectable
pursuits
that
is
writing?
So
when
you
get
a
phone
call
from
a
student
who
would
"just
really
like
it
if
you
could
maybe
read
her
paper
again
even
though
you've
already
had
a
conference,"
the
smile
just
stretches
from
ear
to
ear.
It's
a
feeling
that's
like
no
other
-perhaps
a
feeling
that
teachers
experience
every
day
making
the
profession
so
rewarding
-
it
reminds
you
of
why
you
wanted
to
be
a
WA
in
the
first
place,
before
the
stack
of
twenty-some
research
papers
on
the
history
of
metal
show
up
in
your
mailbox
at
the
beginning
of
final's
week.
It's
the
feeling
of
confidence
-
in
yourself
and
your
students.
And
it
was
this
feeling
that
I
took
great
pleasure
in
experiencing
last
Spring,
making
the
job
that
I
already
enjoy
so
much,
all
the
more
better.
Because
my
last
semester
was
particularly
rewarding,
I
decided
I
ought
to
take
a
closer
look
at
my
performance.
What
was
I
doing
right
or
different
than
in
previous
semesters?
The
first
thing
that
stands
out
in
my
mind
as
being
unique
from
semesters
past,
is
professor
involvement.
A
key
part
in
being
a
successful
WA
is
knowing
what
the
professor
is
looking
for
in
a
paper.
This
means
going
beyond
simply
understanding
the
assignment
given.
Really
picking
the
professor's
brain
to
learn
what
he
or
she
is
envisioning
-
structure,
length,
number
of
sources,
etc.
-
is
what's
going
to
help
the
student
make
the
grade
as
well
as
gain
more
confidence
in
you.
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
paired
up
with
a
great
professor
last
semester
who
met
with
me
before
each
paper
assignment
to
discuss
the
components
he
was
looking
for
-
in
depth.
The
result?
There
wasn't
a
question
I
could
not
answer
or
a
response
I
wasn't
confident
in
when
I
held
my
conferences.
"Do
you
think
it's
okay
if
I
set
it
up
like
this?"
"Yes."
"Do
you
think
it
works
that
I
state
my
thesis
here?"
"No."
I
knew
exactly
what
the
professor
was
looking
for
and
knowing
this,
my
students
could
actually
use
me
as
a
tool
to
writing
a
better
paper.
This
isn't
to
say
I
didn't
encourage
creativity
and
personal
style.
This
leads
me
to
my
second
performance
observation.
Although
I
had
such
a
detailed
model
to
follow,
my
conference
always
started
off
with
a
five
or
ten
minute
chat
with
the
student
about
what
he
or
she
wrote.
This
way,
I
could
get
a
better
idea
of
what
the
student's
ideas
and
opinions
were
and
then
make
sure
all
those
ideas
were
actually
down
on
paper.
I
have
come
to
learn
in
my
two
years
of
reading
other
students'
papers,
as
well
as
looking
at
my
own
writing
process,
that
sometimes
ideas
are
just
hard
to
put
into
words.
Often,
students
will
have
some
really
interesting
things
to
say
on
a
topic,
but
are
too
wary
of
writing
them
for
lack
of
finding
the
words.
This
is
where
I
try
to
come
in
and
make
sure
those
brainstorms
come
to
life.
I
think
part
of
being
a
good
WA
is
to
put
yourself
in
a
professor's
shoes.
Just
how
many
times
can
you
read
a
paper
about
"the
importance
of
recycling
because
we
need
to
save
our
environment"?
Encourage
your
students
not
to
hold
back.
Get
creative.
Put
a
new
swing
on
things.
I
think
your
professor
will
thank
you
for
it!
Of
course,
all
of
this
depends
on
who
your
professor
is
-
which
is
why
step
one
still
needs
to
be
step
one.
Make
sure
you
get
to
know
your
professor
first
-
before
encouraging
your
students
to
go
freeing
their
minds...
Now
encouraging
the
students
to
add
more
of
that
good
stuff
they
have
floating
around
in
their
brains
is
easy
enough
to
do.
Actually
getting
them
to
do
it
is
another
story.
How
can
you
be
sure
they'll
even
go
back
and
re-think
this
paper?
Well,
you
can't,
but
there
are
a
few
things
that
I
have
tried
that
make
me
feel
confident
that
they'll
at
least
put
a
little
more
time
into
it.
First
of
all,
I
don't
really
mark
up
the
paper
a
whole
lot
before
our
conference.
If
it's
all
spelled
out
for
them,
students
may
sit
their
like
zombies,
not
listen
to
a
word
you
say,
and
then
take
the
paper
home
and
change
all
the
things
you
marked
down.
This
isn't
really
going
to
help
because
the
good
stuff
you
talk
through
with
them,
like
generating
more
ideas
and
adding
more
support,
is
all
going
to
be
forgotten.
Instead,
have
them
write
it
down.
As
you're
going
through
the
paper,
make
sure
the
student
has
a
pen
in
hand
and
marks
down
your
suggestions.
For
brainstorming,
turn
the
paper
over
and
make
a
list
of
new
ideas
and
angles
to
think
about.
Chances
are,
if
the
student
has
already
written
them
down
himself
during
your
conference,
then
he
understands
them
and
will
add
them
to
his
paper.
There
may
be
some
cases,
however,
that
the
WA
needs
to
take
over
a
little
more
than
usual.
If
a
student
brings
me
a
paper
filled
with
strong
ideas,
but
lacking
any
sort
of
organization
-1
find
it
is
easiest
to
make
an
outline
for
him
or
her.
I
will
do
this
prior
to
the
conference.
That
way,
we
can
concentrate
content
issues
rather
than
spend
thirty
minutes
moving
around
paragraphs.
Restructuring
an
entire
paper
can
be
very
time-consuming,
and
often
needs
to
be
done.
Making
a
simple
outline
on
the
back
can
be
very
beneficial
to
the
student
and
also
save
time
in
your
conference.
One
technique
that
I
have
not
tried
but
have
thought
about
often,
is
asking
the
students
to
prepare
three
questions
they
have
about
their
papers
before
coming
to
the
conference.
This
way,
the
student
is
thinking
about
his
paper
from
another
angle.
He
is
examining
it
with
the
desire
for
improvement,
rather
than
coming
to
the
conference
thinking
it's
finished.
Many
times,
a
student
will
finish
the
paper
right
before
the
WA
conference
and
not
want
to
have
anything
else
to
do
with
it.
Requiring
that
he
or
she
have
specific
questions
in
mind
encourages
the
student
to
think
differently.
This
technique
can
also
be
beneficial
to
those
students
who
come
to
the
conference
with
a
"I
know
this
paper
is
awful
and
needs
more
work"
attitude.
Many
students
will
"throw"
something
together
at
the
last
minute
because
they
know
they
need
a
paper
for
their
conference.
Preparing
questions
for
their
WA
is
a
great
way
to
get
their
heads
on
track
and
organize
what
they
already
know
they
need
to
work
on.
I
have
not
tried
this
technique
yet,
but
I
am
planning
to
do
so
this
fall.
Aside
from
WA
techniques
or
ways
of
setting
up
your
conferences,
there
is
still
one
thing
that
is
above
all
the
key
to
encouraging
students
to
come
back
and
see
you.
If
you
can
build
a
friendship
type
of
relationship
with
the
students,
they
are
certain
to
take
your
job
(and
their
papers)
more
seriously.
You
don't
want
to
be
condescending
or
authoritative
-
this
will
only
create
tension
and
indifference.
You
want
to
be
their
peer
-someone
they
can
just
talk
to,
as
well
as
look
to
for
advice.
Put
yourself
right
back
into
their
shoes,
when
you
were
a
freshman
meeting
with
your
WA,
or
as
a
sophomore
or
junior
meeting
with
a
WA
that
may
even
be
your
age.
You
didn't
want
to
feel
as
if
meeting
with
the
WA
was
like
meeting
with
the
professor.
You
wanted
strong
advice
but
from
someone
who
was
just
like
you.
This
is
key
-
if
you
can
establish
that
level
of
understanding
and
trust
with
each
of
your
students,
they
will
use
your
knowledge
of
writing
to
strengthen
their
own
skills.
And
you
will
have
fulfilled
your
duties
as
a
WA.
Because
of
my
successful
semester
and
because
I
know
I
can't
expect
my
next
two
semesters
to
be
exactly
the
same,
I
plan
on
approaching
my
semester
differently
than
before.
After
outlining
my
own
experiences,
I
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
are
two
key
things
a
WA
can
do
to
improve
his
or
her
performance.
The
first,
and
most
important,
is
talking
to
the
professor.
I
am
going
to
come
prepared
with
a
number
of
questions
for
my
professor
and
make
absolute
sure
we
meet.
As
I
outlined
earlier,
this
can
"make
or
break"
your
success
at
the
bond
between
you
and
your
students.
The
second
thing
I
plan
on
doing
this
semester
is
turning
to
other
WA's
for
advice.
Just
think
of
how
much
advice
they
have!
We
should
really
take
advantage
of
those
staff
meetings
because
there
could
be
a
technique
out
there
that
you
don't
know
about.
We
are
all
colleagues
and
we
should
learn
from
each
other.
Although
this
is
my
last
year
as
a
WA,
I
plan
on
making
it
my
best
year
yet
by
trying
out
new
techniques
and
seeing
what
works.
After
a
semester
as
rewarding
as
my
last
one,
I
am
anxious
to
repeat
that
success
and
perhaps
discover
things
that
work
even
better.
Whatever
the
outcome,
though,
I
will
feel
successful
simply
knowing
that
I
am
making
a
difference.
Even
if
that
difference
is
small
and
the
student
let's
me
know
just
how
insignificant,
I
will
try
to
remember
that
just
taking
those
thirty
minutes
to
take
a
look
at
his
or
her
writing
is
doing
something.
Obviously
requesting
an
extra
conference
is
not
an
indicator
that
you
are
a
super-WA.
This
is
just
an
added
bonus.
The
indicator
is
when
your
students
leave
the
conferences
with
a
smile.
Not
because
you're
a
funny
guy
or
you
let
them
go
after
five
minutes.
A
smile
of
confidence
-
confidence
in
your
advice
and,
most
importantly,
in
their
own
writing.
