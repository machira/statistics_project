"Writing
Like
a
WA"
Freshman
year
I
felt
like
a
guinea
pig.
I
was
put
through
all
sorts
of
tests
to
see
how
well
I
could
write
at
the
college
level.
Although
I
had
preparatory
and
advanced
classes
in
high
school,
I
never
truly
knew
what
to
expect
of
college
writing.
My
first
year
at
Lafayette
showed
me
just
how
important
it
is
to
write,
and
to
write
well.
My
grades
suddenly
depended
on
those
final
term
papers.
I
also
felt
the
pressure
to
establish
myself
as
a
good
writer
amongst
the
faculty.
As
soon
as
I
became
accustomed
to
writing
journal
entries
everyday
and
reaction
papers
or
"mini-papers",
freshman
year
had
ended
and
I
was
starting
a
whole
new
experience
as
a
sophomore
Writing
Associate.
Even
as
a
writing
associate
and
with
a
year
of
writing
experience
at
the
college
level,
I
still
had
a
lot
to
learn,
I
also
had
a
lot
more
work.
Every
one
of
my
classes
required
me
to
write
papers
or
labs.
In
fact
I
do
not
think
I
was
ever
detached
from
my
keyboard.
On
top
of
this,
my
job
as
a
WA
required
that
I
read
other
writer's
papers
as
well.
Soon
I
was
reading
writing,
editing
writing,
analyzing
writing,
and
talking
about
writing.
Therefore,
the
mere
exposure
I
had
to
writing
greatly
affected
my
own
writing
process.
Being
a
WA
not
only
allowed
me
to
help
other
writers
but
greatly
benefited
me
as
well.
Perhaps
the
area
that
I
saw
the
most
improvement
was
in
my
own
sentences
and
editing
style.
In
the
past
I
have
thought
of
myself
as
a
pretty
confident
writer
and
I
usually
did
not
have
too
many
problems
starting
or
ending
my
papers.
However,
I
am
sometimes
lacking
in
the
technical
aspects
of
writing
such
as
sentence
structure
and
grammar.
Studying
the
St.
Martin's
Handbook
really
helped
me
because
I
was
constantly
looking
at
and
correcting
grammar
and
poorly
structured
sentences.
Teaching
proper
grammar
and
making
suggestions
to
other
writers
really
helped
me
as
well.
The
suggestions
1
made
for
improvement
were
so
fresh
in
my
head
that
when
I
wrote
my
papers
I
found
myself
writing
better.
The
repetition
of
looking
for
improper
grammar
in
other's
papers
really
helped
me
to
look
for
possible
corrections
in
my
own
writing.
This
leads
into
how
I
have
improved
in
editing
my
own
papers.
In
the
past
I
have
often
been
lazy
and
I
never
liked
to
proofread
my
work
more
than
once.
I
would
usually
scroll
to
the
top
of
my
computer
screen,
give
the
essay
a
quick
reading,
print
it
out,
and
pray
for
a
good
grade.
In
the
past
year
I
have
begun
to
appreciate
the
whole
editing
and
proofreading
process.
I
now
see
my
writing
as
more
of
a
work
in
process
that
can
be
trimmed,
cut
into,
added
to,
or
buttered
up.
My
papers
are
no
longer
one
attempt
projects
that
I
quickly
print
out.
Now
I
often
write
a
little
and
take
a
break
and
then
go
back
again
when
I
want
to
write
and
when
my
ideas
come
to
me.
I
have
found
this
approach
to
writing
to
be
more
enjoyable
because
it
means
that
I
can
spend
time
on
the
paper
and
not
stress
myself
out
at
the
last
minute.
I
also
read
my
papers
more
than
once
for
grammatical
errors,
content,
and
clarity.
My
WA
in
my
VAST
course
this
past
year
also
helped
me
to
see
flaws
in
my
writing
and
to
edit
with
a
more
careful
eye.
I
also
found
her
useful
because
I
think
a
second
opinion
on
my
papers
always
helps
me
to
get
an
idea
of
what
1
need
to
spend
more
time
on.
Through
working
with
other
WA's
and
by
being
one
myself,
I
have
learned
so
much
about
how
other
students
my
age
write.
I
have
listened
to
other
writers
at
staff
meetings,
conferences,
and
by
simply
engaging
in
conversation
with
my
friends.
In
these
talks
I
have
learned
that
everyone
has
their
own
approach
to
writing
and
editing.
As
a
WA
I
do
not
try
to
change
another's
writing
process
if
they
are
already
comfortable
with
their
style.
Although
a
writer's
style
may
be
different
from
my
own,
it
does
not
mean
they
write
poorly,
just
differently.
Instead
1
try
to
just
offer
suggestions
about
how
the
writer
can
improve
their
drafts.
I
try
to
make
sense
of
the
paper
and
I
ask
the
writer
to
do
the
same.
Although
I
have
always
found
it
easy
to
read
for
clarity
and
comprehension
in
other's
writing,
I
find
it
difficult
to
see
if
my
own
writing
makes
sense.
My
words
on
paper
come
from
my
mind
and
therefore
make
complete
sense
to
me.
However,
I
have
realized
at
college
that
others
may
not
understand
what
I
am
trying
to
say
in
my
work.
Although
this
can
be
frustrating
at
first,
I
now
try
to
write
with
my
audience
in
mind
and
sometimes
I
read
my
work
outloud.
I
suggest
both
of
these
tactics
to
my
writers
as
well.
My
goal
as
a
WA
is
to
help
others
make
sense
of
their
writing
both
to
themselves
(which
they
often
need)
and
to
their
audiences
as
well.
Now
I
also
reread
my
papers
to
see
if
my
writing
will
make
sense
to
others.
I
try
to
put
myself
in
my
audience's
shoes
and
to
see
if
they
will
grasp
the
concepts
I
am
trying
to
get
across
on
paper.
This
is
yet
another
way
in
which
my
writing
has
improved
as
a
direct
result
of
being
a
WA.
Although
most
of
my
writing
was
significantly
affected
by
my
job
as
a
WA,
I
have
also
had
some
obstacles
in
the
past
year
in
my
psychology
classes
that
have
helped
me
to
grow
as
a
writer
in
my
specific
course
of
study.
Psychology
APA-style
papers
have
proven
to
be
pretty
difficult
for
me
to
write.
I
had
written
many
labs
in
high
school
but
their
style
never
had
to
meet
strict
guidelines
and
my
teacher
never
made
that
many
corrections.
Now
I
have
had
to
do
APA
papers
about
psych-related
issues
and
I
have
lab
reports
due
every
week.
At
first
I
found
it
disconcerting
that
I
was
not
doing
as
well
as
I
would
have
liked,
but
these
psychology
courses
provided
a
challenge
for
me,
one
that
I
needed
to
meet
diligently
and
successfully
since
I
would
have
many
more
similar
papers
to
write
in
the
future.
To
remedy
my
situation,
I
studied
the
APA
Psychology
handbook
and
looked
through
the
St.
Martin's
Handbook,
asked
my
professors
questions
and
read
other
labs
and
papers
written
by
my
friends.
I
found
reading
other
students
labs
and
papers
to
be
the
most
helpful
since
I
could
see
how
my
writing
compared
to
theirs
and
where
their
professors
had
made
corrections.
Gradually
my
psychology
papers
have
improved
and
although
I
still
have
more
to
learn
about
writing
the
labs,
I
have
been
able
to
develop
by
simply
reading
other's
writing.
This
dovetails
with
my
job
as
a
WA.
When
I
read
my
student's
writing
I
also
benefit
because
I
gain
or
sometimes
reaffirm
my
own
confidence
as
a
writer
When
I
read
poor
papers,
and
I
have
encountered
a
few
horrible
papers
in
the
past
year,
I
am
moved
to
want
to
help
my
writers
and
I
also
begin
to
appreciate
my
own
strengths
as
a
writer,
1
am
not
saying
that
I
like
to
see
poor
writing
so
that
I
can
feel
better
about
myself,
but
it
does
make
me
confident
when
I
can
recognize
poor
errors
in
others'
papers
and
know
that
I
can
make
suggestions
for
improvement.
Reading
good
papers
is
also
rewarding,
although
it
can
be
intimidating.
When
I
read
well-written
drafts
I
am
often
at
a
loss
of
words
for
improvement
but
1
use
these
papers
to
my
advantage
at
the
same
time.
I
study
a
draft
that
I
think
is
well-done
and
I
make
mental
notes
of
what
makes
the
paper
"work"
for
the
writer.
1
then
try
to
remember
these
aspects
of
good
writing
when
I
am
sitting
at
my
computer
writing
my
own
papers.
So
therefore,
I
can
really
learn
from
other's
work
and
writing*
I
believe
that
peer
editing
should
be
more
commonplace
in
college
so
that
students
have
this
opportunity
for
enrichment
by
simply
working
with
and
learning
from
their
peers.
Another
way
my
writing-process
has
been
affected
by
being
a
WA
is
that
I
have
begun
to
practice
what
I
preach.
There
are
times
when
I
will
suggest
for
a
student
to
write
an
outline
of
his/her
paper
and
I
never
used
to
do
this
myself
even
though
I
thought
it
was
a
good
tool
for
some
people.
Now
I
catch
myself
jotting
down
my
ideas
before,
during,
and
even
after
I
write
my
big
papers.
I
have
also
suggested
that
students
talk
to
their
professors
about
their
writing
so
they
can
truly
understand
what
he/she
wants
from
them.
I
encourage
students
to
keep
lines
of
communication
open
with
their
professors
so
they
can
get
a
second
opinion
on
their
drafts
or
even
to
question
a
teacher's
grade
or
corrections
on
a
completed
paper.
Although
I
do
communicate
quite
well
with
some
of
my
professors,
I
have
never
really
asked
any
of
them
exactly
how
I
can
improve
my
own
writing
and
what
they
think
I
should
work
on
more.
In
the
past
year
there
are
two
examples
of
my
change
in
behavior
in
relation
to
my
professor-student
relationships.
I
have
gone
to
an
Anthropology
professor
before
my
final
paper
was
due
to
have
him
read
my
draft
and
make
suggestions.
I
found
that
to
be
extremely
useful
and
I
ended
up
changing
a
whole
section
of
my
paper
in
compliance
with
my
professors's
suggestions.
I
have
also
gone
to
my
VAST
teacher
to
venture
a
question
I
have
always
been
afraid
to
ask:
"what
do
I
need
to
do
to
move
my
writing
from
B
work
to
A
work?"
My
VAST
professor
then
made
suggestions
on
how
1
could
achieve
my
goal.
I
have
found
that
professors
really
are
not
big
bad
wolves
ready
to
gobble
me
up
when
I
drop
into
office
hours,
but
are
instead
helpful
tools
in
my
writing
process.
After
I
kept
repeating
my
advice
to
other
writer's
to
seek
out
a
professor,
I
finally
listened
to
my
own
advice.
Now
I
reap
the
rewards
of
open
communication
between
professors
and
students.
All
of
these
examples
show
how
beneficial
being
a
WA
can
be.
To
me,
writing
like
a
WA
is
a
confident
booster,
a
reward,
a
privilege,
and
a
lesson
all
rolled
into
one.
Although
I
am
no
Faulkner
or
Hemingway,
I
have
moved
up
the
writing
hierarchy
from
writing
like
a
scared
guinea
pig
to
writing
like
a
WA.
I
am
satisfied
with
the
fact
that
I
have
evolved
and
developed
as
a
writer
in
the
past
year
and
I
hope
to
continue
to
do
so
as
I
learn
more
about
my
role
as
a
WA,
others'
writing,
and
my
own
weaknesses
and
strengths
as
a
writer.
