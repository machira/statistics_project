Literacy
Narrative
When
I
first
read
this
assignment,
I
thought
to
myself
that
it
was
going
to
be
difficult.
How
am
I
supposed
to
remember
everything
about
the
things
that
have
shaped
me
as
a
writer,
starting
as
far
back
as
elementary
school?
Then,
when
I
thought
about
my
past
as
a
writer
even
for
just
a
moment,
a
lot
of
memories
came
flooding
back.
If
the
focus
of
this
assignment
is
to
identify
some
select
formative
writing
experiences
from
many
years
ago
up
to
now,
I
cannot
honestly
say
there
are
tons
of
them
from
my
elementary
school
days.
I
have
vague
memories
of
writing
stories
as
a
class
in
kindergarten
or
first
grade
with
the
aid
of
the
teacher;
the
kinds
of
stories
that
are
written
on
a
really
big
sheet
of
paper,
and
eventually
displayed
on
the
hallway
walls
or
on
a
bulletin
board.
I
also
remember
doing
a
fairly
large
report
on
the
Sioux
Native
American
tribe
in
fifth
grade
-
well,
I'm
sure
it
was
large
for
a
fifth
grader
anyway.
I
think
perhaps
some
of
the
earliest,
most
memorable
writing
experiences
came
in
the
middle
school
years.
In
sixth
grade,
I
can
recall
being
required
to
read
a
certain
number
of
books
every
quarter,
and
we
would
write
reports
on
them.
The
reports
were
a
bit
more
involved
than
a
mere
plot
summary,
though
a
summary
was
part
of
the
assignment.
In
addition
to
discussing
the
plot,
however,
we
would
also
address
questions
about
what
we
read,
such
as
how
we
felt
about
certain
parts
of
the
story,
or
the
characters,
and
things
of
that
nature.
In
addition
to
the
written
assignment,
we
would
have
"book
conferences"
with
the
teacher
to
discuss
the
book
and
our
work.
I
remember
having
assignments
like
these
all
throughout
middle
school.
In
my
seventh
grade
writing
class,
though,
I
have
particularly
vivid
memories
of
a
journal
everyone
in
the
class
kept.
Writing
in
our
journals
was
something
we
did
every
day
at
the
beginning
of
class,
for
five
or
ten
minutes.
There
was
usually
an
assigned
or
suggested
topic,
and
we
were
to
basically
free
write
in
whatever
direction
that
particular
topic
would
take
us
in.
One
of
the
best
things
about
the
journals
was
that
there
was
always
an
option
to
write
about
whatever
you
wanted,
if
you
didn't
like
the
suggested
topic,
or
if
there
was
a
personal
issue
a
student
really
wanted
or
needed
to
address.
Another
great
feature
about
our
journal
exercise
was
that
students
could
volunteer
to
share
their
writing
with
the
class.
It
was
great
fun
to
see
that
a
group
of
twenty-some
twelve-year-olds
could
actually
be
quiet
all
at
once
to
listen
to
what
their
classmates
had
written
about.
My
seventh
grade
journal
writing
experience
also
brings
to
mind
the
personal
journal
I
kept
at
home,
on
my
own
time
when
I
was
in
middle
school.
I
am
not
exactly
sure
what
drove
me
to
start
keeping
a
journal/diary.
I
think
maybe
it
started
as
more
of
a
scrapbook,
and
then
I
just
started
writing
in
it,
and
I
kept
it
up
for
several
years.
I
am
also
not
sure
what
made
me
stop
writing
in
it,
maybe
once
I
reached
high
school
I
felt
I
was
too
busy
or
something.
Looking
back,
though,
I
view
that
journal
as
a
really
valuable
experience
and
something
I
will
certainly
treasure
forever,
mainly
because
the
middle
school
years
of
adolescence
are
typically
some
of
the
most
difficult
years
kids
face
while
growing
up,
for
several
reasons.
It
was
great
being
able
to
put
my
mind
onto
paper
whenever
I
felt
like
it,
and
not
have
to
worry
about
anyone
reading
what
I
wrote,
because
it
was
for
me
and
me
alone.
With
these
experiences,
I
entered
high
school
with
four
years
of
English
class
ahead
of
me.
Sadly,
I
don't
remember
extremely
strongly
the
kinds
of
writing
I
was
asked
to
do
in
my
ninth
and
tenth
grade
English
classes.
When
I
look
back
at
those
classes,
I
can
remember
the
group
projects
we
had
to
do
more
easily
than
I
can
the
writing
assignments.
I
do,
however,
recall
my
writing
experiences
in
eleventh
and
twelfth
grade
rather
well.
I
remember
writing
essays
addressing
topics
and
concepts
introduced
in
books
we
were
reading
for
our
classes.
Looking
back,
I
do
feel
my
writing
progressed
during
my
high
school
years,
in
that
maybe
it
became
more
mature
than
it
had
been
in
earlier
years.
I
learned
what
a
thesis
was,
and
that
it
had
to
be
supported
with
evidence
in
the
following
paragraphs,
which,
of
course
turned
out
to
be
a
rather
important
thing
in
any
writing
I
have
done
here
at
Lafayette.
Where
I
feel
my
high
school
writing
experiences
fell
short
was
in
allowing
students
to
really
write
creatively.
I
frequently
felt
far
too
conscious
of
the
audience
I
was
writing,
whether
that
audience
was
my
teacher,
who
would
be
assigning
the
grade,
or
the
College
Board,
who
would
be
responsible
for
my
Advanced
Placement
scores.
In
eleventh
grade
English,
a
lot
of
emphasis
was
placed
on
the
"basic
five
paragraph
essay."
It
went
something
like,
introductory
paragraph
with
thesis
stated
at
the
end,
plus
three
supporting
paragraphs
and
one
paragraph
conclusion,
yielded
an
acceptable
piece
of
writing,
provided
the
paragraphs
were
well-written.
I
didn't
feel
there
was
much
room
to
really
break
out
of
that
mold.
This
trend
continued
into
senior
year,
in
Advanced
Placement
English.
As
a
class
that
could
earn
a
person
college
credit,
it
was
reasonably
challenging.
At
the
same
time,
the
main
focus
of
the
class
was
to
prepare
us
for
the
AP
exam.
As
a
result,
I
again
felt
writing
specifically
for
the
AP
exam
was
stressed.
Admittedly,
this
really
is
necessary
in
a
class
with
a
goal
of
getting
students
college
credit,
but
it
doesn't
do
much
to
encourage
diversity
in
writing.
Also
in
my
senior
year,
I
took
a
class
called
College
Research.
The
most
notable
thing
about
this
class
was
the
infamous
"research
paper."
This
paper
could
be
done
on
any
topic;
it
was
the
writer's
choice.
I
did
my
paper
on
a
topic
associated
with
the
Holocaust.
I
remember
doing
the
research
for
the
paper,
and
it
was
an
easy
topic
to
find
plenty
of
information
on,
for
obvious
reasons.
When
I
finished
the
paper,
complete
with
title
page
and
bibliography,
it
was
probably
ten
to
fifteen
pages
long
-
the
expected
length.
I
wasn't
particularly
proud
of
it,
I
really
felt
it
was
someone
else's
ideas,
namely
the
people
who
wrote
the
books
I
researched,
re-worded
and
put
into
my
paper
in
a
logical
order.
I
wondered
if
research
papers
in
college
would
be
anything
like
the
one
I
had
written.
On
a
more
positive
note,
I
think
some
good
came
out
of
the
experience
in
that,
for
most
of
the
students,
including
myself,
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
probably
written
a
paper
of
that
genre
and
length.
Finally,
I
brought
all
of
these
past
writing
experiences
with
me
into
college
here
at
Lafayette.
As
for
most
students,
my
first
experience
with
a
writing
course
was
my
first
year
seminar.
My
FYS
was
anything
but
a
bucket
of
cold
water
thrown
in
my
face.
It
was
more
like...
a
warm
bath
taken
along
with
a
double
dose
of
NyQuilO.
Yeah,
unfortunately,
it
was
that
bad,
and
that
boring.
Class
discussion
(or
lack
thereof)
was
mundane,
and
I
learned
nothing
new
about
myself
as
a
writer.
My
professor
made
few
comments
and
suggestions
regarding
my
writing,
and
any
made
were
vague
and
not
helpful
in
the
least.
I
was
disappointed
that
I
was
not
able
to
grow
as
a
writer
from
the
course.
As
a
result,
despite
the
fact
that
I
had
credit
for
College
Writing
from
my
AP
English
exam
score,
I
opted
to
take
the
course
anyway
in
the
second
semester
of
my
freshman
year,
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
really
good
decision.
My
College
Writing
class
was
great.
It
was,
without
a
doubt,
the
best
writing
course
I
have
ever
taken.
My
professor
challenged
me
to
become
a
better
writer,
with
extensive
marginal
comments,
personal
conferences,
peer
conferencing,
and
plenty
of
freedom
to
be
creative
with
my
writing.
I
learned
what
real
revision
entailed,
and
picked
up
some
other
great
ways
to
generate
ideas
and
paper
topics
as
well.
For
example,
I
have
made
free
writing
a
staple
exercise
whenever
I
sit
down
to
start
a
piece
of
writing.
I
have
found
it
is
a
great
way
to
get
a
paper
started,
and
to
have
plenty
of
material
to
use
once
I
get
into
it.
I
guess
I've
always
been
a
free
writer
(from
my
middle
school
days...),
and
needed
a
reminder
of
just
how
valuable
it
can
be.
I
really
feel
all
of
these
experiences,
good
or
bad,
have
helped
to
shape
who
I
am
as
a
writer
now.
I
also
believe
most
of
the
growth
has
come
since
entering
college,
as
my
writing
has
acquired
a
maturity
it
didn't
have
in
high
school,
and
I
feel
more
equipped
than
ever
to
read
and
write
many
different
genres,
from
a
personal
narrative
for
an
English
course,
to
a
technical
piece
for
an
engineering
class.
I
think
these
experiences,
in
their
totality,
will
result
in
a
good
WA.
