From
Blank
Storybooks
to
WA-hood
I
returned
home
from
school
one
day
when
I
was
6
with
an
entirely
blank
storybook
and
a
note
from
my
kindergarten
teacher.
The
note
explained
my
teacherOs
concern;
according
to
Ms.
Mies,
I
had
inexplicably
refused
to
create
a
story
to
fill
the
empty
white
pages
of
the
soon-to-be
storybooks
she
had
given
the
class.
And
so
began
my
writing
career.
It
was
not
a
matter
of
difficulty
with
reading
or
writing
that
instigated
my
refusal.
At
this
stage,
we
were
still
expected
only
to
develop
the
ideas
for
a
story
and
provide
illustrations,
while
the
physical
act
of
writing
was
left
up
to
our
teachers.
Perhaps
I
was
simply
hesitant
to
share
my
ideas,
because
I
am
certain
that
one
thing
I
did
not
lack
as
a
child
was
a
creative
imagination.
Nonetheless,
even
though
it
escapes
me
now
why
I
so
definitively
refused
to
generate
a
story,
I
am
confident
that
I
started
yielding
to
such
demands
to
write
as
I
have
since
found
many
completed
storybooks
in
the
bottom
of
my
closet.
Throughout
my
elementary
school
years,
however,
writing
was
not
something
readily
enforced.
Math
and
history
are
what
I
remember
dominating
much
of
those
formative
years
in
my
education.
For
example,
in
3rd
grade
my
teacher
held
contests
in
which
students
were
asked
to
complete
a
set
of
math
problems,
and
if
any
student
completed
the
problems
quicker
than
he
did,
he
would
take
that
student
out
for
pizza
during
lunch
time.
It
was
a
rarity
for
him
to
lose,
but
I
was
one
of
two
students
in
the
class
that
year
that
emerged
victorious.
It
is
memories
like
this
that
consume
my
recollections
of
elementary
school.
Since
my
math
ability
was
remarkably
strong,
my
scholastic
capabilities
in
other
areas
were
typically
overlooked,
including
the
area
of
writing.
In
and
of
themselves,
writing
assignments
were
not
frequent
at
this
age
largely
by
the
nature
of
the
school,
but
also
in
large
part
to
my
specific
teacher.
Since
the
importance
of
writing
was
never
much
stressed
in
school,
writing
outside
the
classroom
for
me
was
entirely
nonexistent.
My
first
instances
of
serious
writing
did
not
emerge
until
the
5th
grade.
During
my
second
to
last
year
of
elementary
school
was
the
first
time
my
writing
truly
began
taking
off.
My
teacher
at
the
time,
Ms.
Pappace,
incessantly
stressed
the
importance
of
writing
and
made
all
the
effort
possible
to
incorporate
it
into
her
curriculum.
It
was
the
first
year
a
teacher
of
mine
insisted
on
having
the
class
write
as
much
as
possible;
it
was
also
the
first
year
I
was
ever
required
to
keep
a
journal.
Our
journals
entries,
collected
weekly,
addressed
a
plethora
of
topics.
Not
only
were
they
the
place
where
we
were
required
to
complete
our
daily
Nfree-writes,O
but
the
journals
were
also
used
to
record
responses
to
what
we
were
reading
in
class,
as
well
as
everyday
thoughts
or
feelings.
If
we
wrote
a
page
that
for
whatever
reason
we
did
not
want
to
share
with
Ms.
Pappace,
all
we
had
to
do
was
fold
that
particular
page
in
half,
and
she
would
understand
that
it
was
confidential.
I
feel
as
though
these
journal
entries
got
my
mind
thinking
and
for
the
first
time
recording
what
I
thought,
sometimes
making
way
for
bright
ideas.
I
learned
that
year
to
enjoy
writing;
I
enjoyed
not
only
the
act
of
writing,
but
also
saving
and
eventually
re-reading
what
I
wrote.
In
addition
to
journal
entries,
we
produced
and
shared
a
lot
of
poetry
in
Ms.
PappaceOs
class.
One
example
of
such
a
poem
remains
vivid
in
my
memory.
It
was
a
spring
day
towards
the
end
of
the
school
year,
and
I
was
extremely
upset
with
Ms.
Pappace
for
whatever
the
reason.
Being
the
stubborn
child
I
sometimes
was,
I
blatantly
refused
to
partake
in
anything
we
were
doing
in
class.
Exemplifying
her
composed
and
expressive
persona
she
told
me
simply,
Nwrite
about
it.O
I
initially
dubbed
this
request
as
my
teacher
purely
not
wanting
to
deal
with
me,
but
it
did
not
take
long
before
I
took
her
suggestion
seriously.
With
the
help
of
a
friend
in
the
class,
I
wrote
a
poem
to
Ms.
Pappace
about
why
it
was
I
had
been
upset
with
her.
I
canOt
recall
the
reasons
for
my
immense
discontent
now,
but
I
do
remember
feeling
awfully
embarrassed
once
I
saw
my
teacher
reading
the
poem
after
I
handed
it
to
her.
It
wasnOt
nice,
and
I
didnOt
really
mean
anything
I
said,
but
Ms.
Pappace
understood
and
appreciated
the
fact
that
I
was
voicing
how
I
felt.
If
nothing
else,
this
is
one
of
the
only
experiences
that
remains
vivid
in
my
mind
from
the
beginning
of
this
broadening
interest
in
writing.
I
started
writing
poetry
more
often
on
my
own
time.
It
became
a
good
device
for
me
to
express
my
feelings
and
especially
helpful
after
the
sometimes
draining
fights
with
my
mom.
Even
though
I
donOt
write
poetry
all
that
much
anymore
or
share
it
as
I
did
that
day
in
5th
grade,
the
interest
is
still
there
and
the
results
are
no
less
valuable.
After
my
rather
newly
acquired
interest
in
writing
and
my
familyOs
purchase
of
my
new
favorite
toy,
the
computer,
I
began
writing
often
outside
of
school.
In
6th
grade
I
wrote
a
fictional
story
based
on
my
friends
and
our
encounter
with
a
fabricated
adventure.
I
used
made-up
names
to
represent
certain
people
in
my
life
and
never
shared
the
story
with
anyone
but
a
couple
of
close
friends
and
my
parents.
At
the
time
I
hoped
it
would
eventually
turn
into
a
book,
but
I
never
did
get
that
far.
The
result
was
a
12-page
story
that
I
still
have
today.
I
believe
this
to
be
a
pivotal
point
in
my
writing
career
as
it
went
down
in
history
as
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
my
use
of
pens
or
pencils
in
the
writing
process.
I
began
to
use
the
computer
more
and
more
in
facilitating
my
writing
methods
whether
it
was
organizing
notes,
creating
outlines,
or
beginning
actual
drafts.
The
use
of
the
computer
became
like
second-nature
for
me
and
aided
me
much
in
my
improvement
over
the
years
as
a
writer.
My
next
major
period
of
development
as
a
writer
came
in
the
8th
grade.
During
this
year
I
had
an
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Sims,
who
turned
out
to
be
my
favorite
teacher
that
I
had
ever
had.
Mrs.
Sims
had
the
class
experiment
a
lot
with
writing.
We
wrote
research
papers,
improved
our
grammar,
composed
our
own
arguments
for
debates
held
in
class,
shared
poetry,
and
much
more.
Not
only
were
a
lot
of
these
firsts
for
the
majority
of
our
class,
thus
aiding
in
our
developments
as
writers,
but
we
were
also
provided
with
an
enormous
amount
of
support
along
the
way.
Mrs.
Sims
continuously
encouraged
every
student
in
the
class
to
find
the
writer
inside
of
them,
insisting
that
it
did
in
fact
exist.
She
did
not
only
preach
this
belief
to
the
class,
but
she
was
also
there
to
help
us
every
step
of
the
way.
Through
making
herself
available
before
and
after
school
for
meetings
on
paper
assignments
and
essays,
she
was
able
to
devote
the
amount
of
time
and
effort
necessary
to
truly
help
each
one
of
us
to
improve
our
writing.
I
remember
distinctly
the
comments
Mrs.
Sims
would
write
at
the
end
of
the
rough
drafts
she
let
the
class
hand
in
for
to
her
to
look
over.
Through
writing
something
along
the
lines
of
Nexcellent
startO
at
the
end
of
a
draft,
Mrs.
Sims
helped
establish
in
me
the
confidence
I
needed
to
excel
in
my
writing.
Small
things
like
this
made
me
want
to
write.
Not
only
did
Mrs.
Sims
encourage
us
to
write,
and
be
creative
and
successful
in
doing
so,
but
she
also
provided
us
with
opportunities
in
which
we
shared
our
writing
aloud.
One
such
instance
occurred
after
our
8th
grade
trip
to
the
historic
Ellis
Island.
We
were
given
an
assignment
to
question
our
parents
regarding
our
ancestors
and
where
they
came
from.
Like
many
other
things,
it
was
part
of
the
assignment
to
write
about
our
findings.
I
wrote
a
poem
discussing
my
two
varying
sets
of
family
traditions,
one
side
of
the
family
being
Italian
and
the
other
Romanian
Jew.
One
night
at
a
gathering
for
the
parents
a
couple
of
weeks
later,
some
of
the
students
were
asked
to
share
their
assignments.
Mrs.
Sims
asked
me
to
share
my
poem
about
life
as
a
Nmutt.O
I
was
initially
apprehensive
seeing
as
it
was
my
first
time
sharing
my
writing
in
a
group
other
than
my
peers.
However,
I
overcame
this
uneasiness
and
was
eventually
successful
in
sharing
my
poem.
This
experience
made
me
more
willing
to
share
my
writing
in
the
future.
Thanks
to
an
amazing
English
teacher,
eighth
grade
was
a
successful
year
for
me
in
terms
of
improving
my
writing,
and
it
left
me
more
than
prepared
for
what
was
to
come
in
high
school.
I
found
that
throughout
high
school
my
writing
improvement
became
more
gradual,
increasing
each
year
alongside
the
varying
degrees
of
difficulty
and
complexity
in
the
types
of
writing
assigned.
Prior
to
junior
year,
every
student
was
required
to
take
the
same
certain
English
courses
provided
by
the
department.
These
courses
addressed
the
fundamentals
of
writing
and
provided
students
with
many
opportunities
to
enhance
their
writing
through
practice.
Assignments
were
typically
based
on
readings
done
both
inside
and
outside
the
classroom.
During
this
time,
my
writing
improved
as
a
result
of
the
substantial
amount
of
practice
we
were
given.
Writing
became
second
nature
for
me,
something
I
both
expected
to
do
and
enjoyed
doing.
Junior
year
was
the
first
year
we
were
allowed
to
choose
English
courses
at
our
own
accord.
Being
part
of
a
class
that
I
choose
to
be
in,
rather
than
it
being
required,
made
me
enjoy
even
more
the
writing
I
had
to
do.
One
of
the
courses
I
signed
up
for
was
NCreative
Writing.O
It
became
the
first
time
that
I
was
consistently
writing
creatively
for
school.
This
course
allowed
for
me
to
write
both
fictional
and
non-fictional
short
stories,
poems,
and
whatever
other
types
of
writing
we
were
interested
in.
Assignments
were
broad,
and
as
a
result
I
started
becoming
more
creative
and
expressive
in
my
writing.
I
grew
a
lot
that
semester
through
experimenting
with
different
genres;
I
was
able
to
discover
my
style
as
well
as
topics
I
found
comfortable
writing
about.
My
senior
year
of
high
school
proved
to
be
the
most
challenging
in
terms
of
both
literature
and
writing.
AP
English
presented
difficult
reading
material
that
the
class
was
required
to
understand,
analyze,
and
write
about.
A
good
portion
of
the
course
was
spent
tediously
preparing
for
the
AP
English
exam
in
the
middle
of
May.
This
meant
reading
whole
books
or
small
passages
and
analyzing
them
in
detail
day
after
day.
This
course
allowed
my
analytical
writing
skills
to
flourish.
I
became
successful
in
creating
and
eventually
proving
a
thesis
for
a
given
argument.
Finding
and
incorporating
quotes
to
aid
in
my
argument
became
natural
for
me,
and
I
began
to
sound
more
sophisticated
than
ever
in
my
writing.
It
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
I
was
able
to
look
back
at
my
writing
and
constantly
feel
proud
at
what
I
had
written.
The
feedback
I
was
getting
from
my
teacher
was
no
different.
She
was
extremely
impressed
with
my
writing
and
often
used
my
writing
as
examples
for
the
class.
This
acted
as
the
confidence
boost
I
needed
during
the
crucial
and
sometimes
difficult
times
of
sitting
down
to
begin
a
new
assignment.
It
was
comforting
to
know
that
my
writing
had
really
taken
off
just
in
time
for
my
freshman
year
of
college.
Cutting
my
summer
short
and
beginning
Lafayette
at
the
end
of
August
brought
with
it
much
excitement
and
anxiety.
I
felt
as
though
I
was
prepared,
yet
I
was
able
to
recognize
that
on
many
levels
I
had
a
lot
to
learn.
In
terms
of
my
writing,
high
school
allowed
me
to
create
a
voice
and
style
of
my
own,
while
at
the
same
time
become
comfortable
with
the
process
of
writing.
I
didnOt,
however,
truly
learn
the
tedious
and
sometimes
exhausting
process
of
writing
until
I
came
to
Lafayette.
I
learned
that
writing
is
more
than
simply
generating
ideas
and
producing
them
one
time.
Writing
is
rather
a
constant
generation
and
improvement
of
ideas
that
can
be
reproduced
and
developed
endlessly.
I
found
helpful,
here
at
Lafayette,
that
I
was
able
to
produce
drafts
and
attain
feedback
from
professors
before
so-called
Nfinal
draftsO
were
formed.
This
luxury
allowed
me
to
physically
see
the
changes
needed
to
transform
the
quality
of
my
writing
each
step
of
the
way.
In
addition
to
learning
the
true
process
of
writing,
Lafayette
has
allowed
me
to
rid
my
mind
of
all
previous
myths
regarding
writing
that
I
acquired
throughout
junior
high
and
high
school.
For
instance,
I
quickly
learned
that
introductions
should
avoid
broad
generalizations,
and
it
was
acceptable,
even
preferable,
to
include
NnewO
information
in
the
conclusion.
Lessons
such
as
these
greatly
enhanced
my
writing
overall,
transforming
me
into
a
more
thorough
and
purposeful
writer.
In
my
First
Year
Seminar
course,
Multicultural
Competence,
the
class
was
given
an
assignment
to
test
our
thoughtfulness
as
writers.
We
were
given
a
set
of
three
questions,
each
of
which
had
to
be
answered
within
the
maximum
page
limit
of
7
pages.
However,
there
was
a
catch.
Each
question
had
to
be
answered
in
no
more
or
no
less
than
two
complete
pages.
This
left
one
page
for
an
introduction
and
conclusion,
half
of
a
page
each.
This
may
appear
to
be
a
ridiculously
tedious
and
unrealistic
assignment,
but
it
helped
me
greatly
in
explicitly
and
effectively
conveying
the
points
I
wanted
to
make.
Limits
such
as
these
helped
me
to
steer
clear
of
the
use
of
needless
clichs,
unnecessary
or
ineffective
sentences,
and
overstated
ideas.
Luckily,
there
just
wasnOt
any
room
for
them.
Over
the
years
I
have
witnessed
the
improvement
of
my
writing
on
many
levels.
Through
my
own
experiences
with
different
teachers
and
courses,
I
have
explored
a
variety
of
genres
and
discovered
my
comfort
levels
and
interests.
But
most
importunately,
I
have
noticed
the
growth
of
myself
as
a
writer.
I
have
transformed
from
the
timid
and
unexpressive
kindergartener
I
once
was
into
a
successful
and
confident
college
writer.
And
the
best
part
is,
I
am
just
getting
started.
