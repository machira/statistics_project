Returning
WA
Narrative
August

2005
A
Year
in
Writing
I
started
out
my
junior
year
ambitious,
and
to
be
honest,
maybe
a
little
bit
anal
retentive.
I
knew
that
by
now,
in
the
summer
before
my
senior
year,
IOd
be
applying
to
law
school,
so
my
junior
year
was
that
much
more
important.
My
grades
in
every
class
needed
to
improve;
I
know
itOs
better
for
application
readers
to
see
a
positive
incline
instead
of
a
plateauNeven
if
your
grades
were
above
average
in
the
first
place.
I
wanted
to
broaden
my
horizons
while
tackling
as
many
requirements
for
my
two
majors,
so
that
way
I
could
take
as
much
stress
as
possible
off
my
senior
year.
I
also
had
a
lot
of
responsibility
from
the
very
start
of
the
semester;
I
was
continuing
my
work
as
a
Resident
Adviser,
starting
my
first
year
as
a
Writing
Associate,
and
serving
as
a
Rho
Gamma
for
the
Sorority
Recruitment
process.
The
most
important
piece
of
writing
I
have
ever
done
was
composed
before
the
school
year
even
started
though;
I
wrote
and
read
the
eulogy
at
my
grandfatherOs
funeral.
I
had
only
known
one
grandfather
in
my
lifetime;
my
fatherOs
father
passed
away
before
I
was
born.
With
that
exception,
I
had
never
experienced
loss
before
the
passing
of
my
grandfather.
It
didnOt
come
as
a
surprise
for
any
of
usNin
fact,
we
had
been
preparing
for
it
for
an
entire
year.
My
grandfather
had
gone
into
the
hospital
August
11,
2003,
after
I
called
911
because
I
noticed
he
wasnOt
breathing,
and
he
spent
the
next
(and
last)
year
of
his
life
being
moved
from
ward
to
ward
in
the
hospital,
from
ICU
to
CCU
to
rehab,
with
the
occasional
unsuccessful
stint
in
a
rehabilitation
facility
outside
of
the
main
hospital.
We
knew
it
was
coming
the
day
he
died
because
the
doctors
told
us
what
to
expect.
Part
of
me
couldnOt
(and
wouldnOt)
believe
them
even
then,
because
I
had
rushed
home
from
school
before
with
the
same
prognosis
only
to
find
him
near
full
recovery
a
few
weeks
later.
But
he
did
pass
away,
August
15,
2004,
and
my
family
spent
the
next
few
days
making
his
final
preparations.
Dealing
with
funeral
services
is
like
translating
from
a
foreign
language
comprised
mainly
of
euphemisms.
This
was
incredibly
frustrating
to
me.
I
would
consider
myself
a
fairly
direct
person,
and
for
me
to
have
been
facing
a
very
cold
reality
in
a
roundabout
way
could
not
have
been
more
agitating.
I
understand
itOs
largely
for
sensitivity
purposes,
but
at
the
time
I
donOt
think
they
could
have
hurt
me
anymore
than
I
already
was
hurting.
Last
year
in
my
literacy
narrative
(which
was
written
before
his
death)
focused
mainly
on
the
power
words
can
haveNthe
delicate
words
chosen
by
the
funeral
directors
as
NsensitiveO
were
more
offensive
to
me
than
the
truth
was.
Obituaries
are,
for
the
most
part,
written
without
any
style.
ItOs
like
a
somber
game
of
mad-libs.
If
someone
dies
young,
they
may
get
more
attention,
but
otherwise
they
are
minimal.
That
might
have
been
more
representative
of
my
grandfather
though;
he
rarely
said
anything.
My
brother
told
me
that
a
few
days
before
he
died,
he
asked
my
grandfather
if
he
had
any
words
of
wisdom
to
share.
He
told
my
brother
if
he
thought
of
anything,
heOd
let
him
know.
Maybe
thatOs
all
his
obituary
should
have
said.
I
didnOt
volunteer
to
write
his
eulogy,
and
I
sure
didnOt
want
to
read
it
at
the
church.
I
donOt
normally
shy
away
from
writing
tasks,
but
every
time
I
heard
a
eulogy
given,
I
wondered
how
anyone
could
have
the
strength
not
only
to
form
coherent
sentences
in
their
time
of
grief,
but
to
also,
deliver
a
highly
personal.
One
of
my
best
friendOs
from
high
school
gave
the
eulogy
at
her
younger
brotherOs
funeral.
I
wouldnOt
have
been
able
to
stand
up.
I
eventually
found
out
that
sometimes
you
donOt
have
a
choiceNitOs
not
like
putting
off
a
paper
for
class
until
the
last
minuteNitOs
a
chance
to
celebrate
someoneOs
life
and
hopefully
make
up
for
an
otherwise
bland
obituary.
My
oldest
brother
had
originally
agreed
to
write
and
deliver
the
eulogy;
all
I
had
to
do
was
proofread
it
(an
example
of
how
a
WAOs
skills
extend
beyond
the
scope
of
First-Year
Seminar
classes
and
VAST
coursework).
Except
when
I
woke
up
on
the
morning
of
my
grandfatherOs
funeral,
I
was
awakened
by
my
brother
staring
at
blank
screen
of
a
computer
which
lit
up
the
room.
There
wasnOt
a
word
on
the
page.
We
didnOt
have
much
time
before
we
had
to
report
to
the
funeral
home;
I
told
him
if
he
didnOt
have
anything
written
by
the
time
I
got
out
of
the
shower
IOd
try
to
help.
When
I
came
back
into
my
room,
he
admitted
he
had
given
up.
The
priest
could
say
a
few
wordsNmy
brother
couldnOt.
I
couldnOt
stand
to
think
that
while
I
am
never
at
a
lack
for
material,
I
wouldnOt
be
able
to
come
up
with
anything
to
say
about
my
grandfatherOs
whole
life.
So,
I
sat
down
at
my
computer
and
wrote.
It
seemed
awkward
at
first,
writing
something
so
personal
on
a
computer.
I
would
normally
envision
someone
curled
up
in
a
ball
on
the
floor
of
their
room,
hovering
over
a
tear-stained
scrap
of
paperNbecause
the
technology
of
spell
check
is
unforgiving.
I
had
to
turn
it
off
because
I
couldnOt
stand
the
green
swiggly
lines
underneath
my
sentence
fragments;
the
fragments
sounded
more
like
me
and
more
like
him.
Anything
else
would
have
seemed
like
a
lie.
My
finished
product
wasnOt
flawless,
but
I
knew
it
didnOt
have
to
be.
Most
arguments
are
best
articulated
with
a
clean
mind
and
even
clearer
direction,
but
I
realized
what
I
was
saying
meant
much
more
than
the
sentence
structure.
As
was
true
when
I
wrote
this
paper
last
year,
my
most
powerful
pieces
of
writing
have
come
when
there
has
been
real
emotion
behind
them,
when
they
are
absolutely
raw
and
untouched,
less
than
suitable
for
publication
or
grading.
IOm
having
the
same
problem
now
(on
a
lesser
scale,
of
course,
I
consider
my
grandfatherOs
eulogy
to
trump
in
importance
to
everything
else)
with
my
personal
statement
for
my
law
school
applications.
I
can
sit
down
and
write;
itOs
when
I
try
to
edit
I
have
problems.
Everything
sounds
altered
and
artificial.
I
donOt
mind
editing
my
papers,
but
editing
my
personal
statement
feels
a
little
bit
like
editing
my
life.
I
know
IOm
not
actually
cutting
out
pieces
of
my
life,
but
itOs
strange
to
say
things
are
too
boring
or
too
personal
or
on
the
whole,
inconsequential.
Even
as
I
attempt
to
write
it,
I
edit
myself;
I
donOt
want
to
sound
too
casual,
or
too
formal,
or
too
much
like
every
other
application
essay
that
I
will
be
competing
against.
Since
law
schools
do
not
offer
interviews,
this
is
my
only
chance
to
highlight
my
personality.
Normally
(or
at
least,
in
my
opinion),
interviews
are
the
strongest
part
of
my
application
because
I
feel
at
ease
in
most
situations.
But
in
an
interview,
the
interviewer
canOt
take
a
red
pen
to
circle
grammatical
errors
and
they
can
better
hear
the
sarcasm
in
your
voice
without
it
coming
across
as
arrogant
on
paper.
Hopefully
IOll
be
able
to
find
a
good
balance
before
the
applications
are
due.
I
have
thus
far
explained
my
experience
as
a
writer
before
my
career
as
a
WA
even
began
and
the
stresses
I
feel
from
writing
even
now
a
year
into
the
position.
Both
working
as
a
WA
and
attending
staff
meetings
with
my
peers
definitely
made
me
reevaluate
myself
as
a
writer.
I
was
fortunate
enough
first
semester
to
be
assigned
to
a
FYS
professor
very
in
support
of
the
College
Writing
Program
who
made
my
job
as
easy
as
possible.
He
gave
structure
to
my
work
by
including
mandatory
Npaper
due
to
WAO
dates
on
the
syllabus
for
the
students
and
we
met
before
each
paper.
From
the
start,
I
always
encouraged
the
students
to
do
two
things:
check
their
St.
MartinOs
Handbook
instead
of
throwing
away
$50
by
leaving
it
at
the
bottom
of
their
closest,
and
to
seek
out
professors
during
their
office
hours
if
they
ever
needed
extra
help.
I
realized
early
that
most
of
the
students
I
worked
with
had
a
lot
of
college
questions
that
werenOt
about
their
papers,
and
I
liked
being
able
to
help
them.
I
was
impressed
with
the
level
most
of
the
students
were
at
after
reading
their
first
set
of
papers,
which
made
me
think
about
how
far
IOd
come
since
my
First
Year
Seminar.
I
remember
the
first
writing
assignment
I
received
my
freshman
year
for
a
five
year
paper.
I
spent
hours
in
the
library
researching
everything
I
could.
I
most
have
used
ten
sources
which
ended
up
totaling
more
than
a
quarter
of
the
paper.
After
some
of
the
work
I
accomplished
this
year
(with
my
thesis
to
look
forward
to),
that
first
assignment
would
be
a
pleasure
to
work
on.
Not
that
the
assignments
have
gotten
much
longerN5
pages,
8
pages,
15E34Eno
big
deal.
My
professors
were
helped
me
tackle
my
fear
of
long
assignments
by
asking
for
smaller
assignments
which
were
eventually
woven
together,
which
forced
me
to
examine
broader
themes
while
keeping
a
strong
focus
on
smaller
topics.
Even
on
five
page
assignments
though,
the
work
expected
and
the
critical
thought
necessitated
is
so
much
higher
than
that
of
an
entering
college
freshman
(and
rightfully
so).
All
of
the
courses
I
took
in
the
past
year
contributed
to
my
development
as
a
writer
as
they
all
asked
different
things
of
me.
However,
as
different
as
their
demands
were,
they
all
required
me
to
think
creatively
and
they
all
allowed
me
to
bring
knowledge
I
had
acquired
from
my
other
classes
into
my
work.
I
thought
of
my
entire
year
as
one
large
interdisciplinary
project.
It
was
just
coincidental
for
me
that
so
much
overlapped
so
well,
but
it
truly
enhanced
my
experience
as
a
writer
at
Lafayette.
As
I
noticed
connections
throughout
all
of
my
coursework,
I
often
found
myself
asking
the
students
I
worked
with
about
any
connections
they
could
make
in
their
classes,
which
often
turned
out
to
be
rewarding
for
both
of
us.
A
lot
of
the
assignments
that
the
students
I
worked
with
were
assigned
last
year
asked
for
a
certain
amount
of
confidence
and
a
great
amount
of
creativity.
I
often
found
the
focus
of
my
conferences
moving
from
grammatical
issues
(which,
lucky
for
me,
most
of
the
students
I
worked
with
had
very
few
of),
to
brainstorming
and
questions
of
research
techniques.
It
was
more
exciting
for
me
to
sit
down
with
a
student
at
the
computer
helping
them
find
inspiration
for
their
assignments
rather
than
referring
to
the
St.
MartinOs
to
double-check
how
to
write
a
certain
citation.
I
could
tell
during
my
conferences
which
students
were
excited
about
their
writing
and
which
students
had
less
than
zero
interest
in
meeting
with
me.
It
was
also
a
pleasure
for
me
to
be
able
to
lift
someoneOs
confidence
by
complimenting
their
work
when
they
previously
thought
they
were
terrible
English
students.
I
always
noticed,
however,
that
the
students
I
considered
to
be
the
best
writers
were
confident,
used
their
own
voice,
and
were
avid
readers,
as
well.
I
have
always
been
convinced
that
one
of
the
best
ways
to
improve
your
writing
was
to
read
moreNworking
as
a
WA,
I
have
had
both
the
opportunity
to
read
the
work
of
my
peers
and
also
to
receive
helpful
suggestions
from
my
fellow
WAs
regarding
how
to
approach
my
work.
My
coursework
this
year
also
involved
more
primary
sources
and
focused
more
on
literary
theory,
which
gave
a
deeper
understanding
into
the
assumptions
I
was
already
bringing
into
my
writing.
Reading
theory
also
helped
me
form
more
coherent,
concise
arguments,
because
I
learned
to
limit
myself
to
a
certain
criticism
or
approach
when
necessary.
Studying
criticism
also
helped
me
understand
that
despite
the
boundaries
between
disciplines,
it
is
apparent
that
they
all
influence
each
other
in
some
way
by
responding
to
each
other,
supporting
each
other,
or
rejecting
whole
schools
of
thought.
So,
while
I
can
limit
myself
to
one
type
of
criticism
in
one
discipline,
I
find
it
more
beneficial
(and
truthful)
to
incorporate
assumptions
for
many
different
criticisms.
This
more
fully
exposes
a
text,
and
I
think
itOs
important
to
recognize
the
different
ways
something
can
be
read.
I
donOt
believe
it
is
a
problem
that
both
readers
and
writers
might
approach
literature
from
distinctive
standpoints,
but
it
is
important
to
recognize
these
standpoints,
what
they
do
for
us,
and
what
they
prevent
us
from
doing.
As
long
as
we
are
aware
of
the
moves
we
make,
it
enables
us
to
get
more
out
of
that
which
we
are
doing.
This
might
be
why
so
many
WA
conferences
start
out
with
the
questions:
what
were
you
trying
to
do?
Where
are
you
taking
this?
Have
you
already
decided
to
change
anything
since
this
was
last
written?
And,
why?
This
year
one
of
the
most
important
things
I
have
learned
is
to
have
a
purpose.
ItOs
alright
sometimes
to
just
sit
down
and
start
writing
hoping
that
something
will
come
out,
but
that
cannot
be
a
finished
product.
When
I
do
something
like
that,
I
like
to
open
a
whole
new
word
document
and
cut
and
paste
things
that
I
like
so
I
feel
like
I
am
creating
something
fresh
instead
of
just
editing.
If
something
is
too
obvious,
you
probably
donOt
need
it.
But,
donOt
be
afraid
to
tell
your
readers
where
you
are
taking
themNthey
might
disagree,
but
they
will
at
least
know
what
youOre
doing.
The
clearer
the
moves
are
you
make,
the
more
likely
youOll
be
able
to
evaluate
them
on
your
own
and
decide
whether
or
not
they
make
any
sense
at
all.
Understanding
literary
criticism
has
helped
me
better
understand
not
only
how
to
approach
literature,
but
also
how
others
will
approach
my
writing.
