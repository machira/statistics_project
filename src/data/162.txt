Literacy
Narrative
By
Project
for
Workshop
Fall
1998
"Mommy,
can
you
please
help
me
with
my
book
report?
I
have
no
idea
where
to
start
and
what
to
say."
This
was
a
familiar
question
that
arose
each
and
every
time
I'd
bring
home
an
assignment.
As
a
quiet,
inquisitive
little
girl
in
Elementary
School,
I'd
much
rather
be
in
Art
class
painting
unicorns,
or
in
Science
class
learning
about
dinosaurs
and
space.
Sure,
English
was
okay,
but
what's
the
point
of
writing
every'
detail
of
a
book?
Reading
books
was
the
fun
part,
the
part
that
excited
me,
the
part
that
took
me
to
another
world
with
the
turn
of
every
page.
But
when
it
came
time
to
writing
a
report,
listing
the
characters
and
the
plot,
I
found
it
a
bit
uninteresting.
However,
I
remember
there
was
one
part
of
writing
book
reports
that
drifted
away
from
the
ho-hum
of
describing
the
setting
-
"Opinion."
This
was
the
paragraph
that
I
could
tell
the
teacher
how
much
I
wished
I
could
be
Mary
and
stumble
upon
a
Secret
Garden,
or
how
I
related
to
James
in
his
escapades
with
a
Giant
Peach.
This
was
where
writing
became
fun.
This
was
where
a
little
sense
of
fire
started
beneath
my
hands
as
I
scribbled
my
thoughts
on
to
giant,
lined
paper.
And
although
this
spark
would
not
ignite
until
years
later,
it
was
the
beginnings
of
a
flame
that
would
grow
into
a
passion
as
I
developed
into
a
young
woman.
These
are
my
first
memories
as
a
writer.
I
wrote
simple
essays
about
what
I
did
over
my
summer
vacation,
what
I
want
for
Christmas
this
year,
and
what
I
want
to
be
when
I
grow
up.
I
think
it
was
third
grade
when
I
wrote
a
whole
page
on
how
I
was
going
to
be
the
town
veterinarian
and
raise
Dalmatians
and
Spaniels.
I
was
proud
of
this
paper
because
I
had
complete
control
over
it.
There
were
no
rules
other
than
indenting
the
first
paragraph
using
your
thumb
as
a
measurement
and
remembering
to
use
periods
and
commas.
I
worked
hard
on
this
assignment
because
I
knew
it
was
important.
After
all,
telling
your
third
grade
teacher
your
plans
for
the
future
was
like
setting
them
in
stone!
I
made
sure
I
wrote
everything
I
needed
to,
in
order
for
her
to
understand
how
I
was
going
to
become
the
greatest
animal
doctor
of
all
time.
Handing
in
writing
assignments
to
your
teacher
in
Elementary
School
was
like
handing
them
a
gift
and
hoping
they'll
love
it.
It
was
this
way
for
me,
anyway.
I
remember
feeling
such
confidence
in
my
papers,
and
getting
them
back
with
a
big,
pink,
"Way
to
Go!"
sticker
on
it
made
me
feel
like
the
best
writer
in
the
whole
world.
It
wasn't
until
I
entered
Middle
School,
the
age
of
insecurity,
that
I
no
longer
felt
like
a
budding
Shakespeare
or
Judy
Blume,
for
that
matter.
I
began
to
panic
whenever
I
sat
down
to
write
reports
on
Martin
Luther
King
Jr.
or
Princess
Diana,
unsure
if
my
writing
capabilities
would
please
my
teacher.
I
demanded
structure
and
always
wanted
to
know
how
many
pages
it
had
to
be
and
how
many
paragraphs
I
should
make.
Writing
essays
were
difficult
because
I
had
so
many
questions
and
thoughts
jumbled
around
in
my
head.
This
was
until
seventh
grade,
when
all
my
questions
were
answered.
This
was
the
year
I
wrote
my
first
real
research
paper.
My
teacher
was
so
thorough
in
describing
every
little
step,
that
I
felt
I
could
do
a
good
job
as
long
as
I
followed
the
rules.
I
made
up
preliminary'
outlines
and
detailed
outlines,
notecards,
and
rough
drafts.
Although
it
seemed
very
overwhelming
at
the
time,
it
was
teaching
me
what
I
hold
most
dear
to
me
today
when
I
am
writing
-
organization.
After
spending
several
months
on
the
entire
process
of
a
research
paper,
I
finally
had
my
finished
product.
My
research
paper
on
the
Republican
Party
was
six
pages
long,
and
was
the
longest,
most
mature
paper
I
had
ever
written.
I
was
proud
once
again.
I
began
to
see
how
writing
worked,
how
it
was
possible
to
organize
all
this
information
into
a
structured
paper.
All
I
had
to
do
was
follow
the
directions.
Now
I
knew
I
wrote
a
pretty
decent
paper.
I
have
to
admit,
I
was
extremely
proud
of
it
and
knew
I
should
feel
confident.
But
I
was
never
expecting
to
hear
what
I
heard
my
English
teacher
say
to
me
after
grading
them.
On
the
back
of
my
research
paper,
right
below
the
big,
black
'A7,
was
a
comment
telling
me
I
had
a
real
"talent
as
a
writer,"
and
that
he
"looks
forward
to
reading
more
of
my
work
in
the
future."
As
if
this
wasn't
enough
to
brighten
my
day
for
weeks,
my
English
teacher
mentioned
this
to
my
parents.
He
told
them
my
writing
was
advanced
for
my
age
and
that
this
is
a
gift
that
should
be
developed.
Needless
to
say,
I
was
thrilled,
however
I
was
more
thrilled
at
the
fact
that
I
got
an
'A'
on
the
paper,
rather
than
my
teacher's
compliments.
I
didn't
think
much
of
this,
just
continued
to
put
forth
as
much
effort
as
it
took
each
time
I
worked
on
a
writing
assignment.
Throughout
eighth
grade,
English
was
based
mostly
around
persuasive
essays.
I
enjoyed
this
immensely
because
I
could
give
my
opinion,
something
that
excited
me
since
I
was
a
little
girl.
I
remember
learning
"How
to
Write
a
Five-Paragraph
Essay"
over
and
over
again.
The
intro-three
paragraphs-conclusion
step
plan
was
drilled
into
my
head
by
writing
countless
essays
on
every
topic
imaginable.
We
learned
the
purpose
of
a
thesis
statement
and,
once
again,
this
idea
of
structure
and
direction
is
what
lead
me
to
success
in
this
genre
of
writing
as
well.
I
won
the
praise
of
this
English
teacher
and
her
confidence,
along
with
my
parents',
in
my
writing
ability
made
me
think
maybe
this
was
my
talent.
I
entered
high
school
with
this
idea
in
the
back
of
my
head.
I
was
placed
in
Honors
English
in
ninth
grade
and
wasn't
very
worried
that
it
may
be
hard.
We
began
writing
analytical
essays
on
Romeo
and
Juliet
and
other
classics.
These
came
easy
to
me,
and
although
I
wasn't
receiving
compliment
after
compliment
from
my
teacher,
I
was
doing
well.
I
remember
getting
the
syllabus
at
the
beginning
of
the
year.
"Second
Marking
Period
-
Creative
Writing."
I
felt
a
little
unsure
of
this
because
I
never
really
did
much
with
this
genre
in
Middle
School.
Actually,
I
instantly
remembered
the
one
time
we
had
to
write
a
"story
about
anything."
Let's
just
say
there
weren't
any
positive
comments
on
the
back
of
that
paper.
Anyway,
we
did
all
sorts
of
creative
writing
this
marking
period:
short
stories,
haikus,
poems,
sonnets,
and
the
list
goes
on.
I
struggled
with
these,
never
happy
with
my
final
products.
It
was
like
someone
had
pulled
blinders
over
my
eyes
and
I
could
no
longer
sit
down
with
a
pen
and
paper
and
just
write.
I
got
discouraged,
and
wondered
if
I
had
possibly
lost
my
"gift."
Tenth
grade
English
was
when
I
discovered
that
it
was
okay
to
be
good
at
one
type
of
writing
and,
well,
not-so-good
at
another.
This
realization,
of
course,
did
not
occur
so
easily.
Mrs.
Faunce.
The
new
English
teacher
who
taught
Honors
English
10
and
some
new
class
she
started
called
Journalism.
I
was
going
to
show
her
just
how
good
of
a
writer
I
was.
From
the
beginning
of
the
year,
she
had
told
us
that
the
focus
of
this
class
was
going
to
be
writing.
"Piece
of
cake,"
I
thought.
Writing
was
my
strong
point
and
I
was
going
to
prove
it
in
this
class.
We
worked
with
all
types
of
writing
once
again.
And
once
again,
I
struggled
with
the
poetry',
the
pantoums,
and
all
the
other
creative
genres
that
I
just
did
not
enjoy.
However,
when
we
began
working
on
persuasive
essays,
I
was
back
on
top
again.
I
remember
I
wrote
an
essay
on
Gun
Control,
filled
with
powerful
phrases,
short
sentences,
and
great
transitions.
It
was
chosen,
along
with
a
few
others,
to
be
published
in
the
new
school
newspaper
that
Mrs.
Faunce
had
started.
I
was
thrilled,
of
course,
and
seeing
my
words
in
print
was
perhaps
the
most
rewarding
feeling
I
had
ever
felt.
Although
I
felt
as
if
I
had
proved
myself
to
Mrs.
Faunce
now,
my
writing
continued
to
be
nothing
more
than
mediocre
in
her
eyes.
Receiving
average
grades
on
papers
satisfied
me,
but
I
began
to
dislike
this
teacher
because
she
was
so
tough
on
us.
She
was
constantly
telling
us
that
she
was
"disappointed
with
our
papers,"
and
that
we
all
needed
to
buckle
down
on
our
writing
skills.
However
discouraged,
I
persisted
to
work
harder.
I
can
remember
the
day
clearly.
Mrs.
Faunce
taking
the
three
of
us
aside
and
describing
her
class
called
Journalism
EL
The
prerequisite
was
Journalism
I,
and
the
class
entailed
producing
the
newspaper
and
learning
the
ways
of
journalistic
writing.
She
telling
us
that
she
wanted
us
to
jump
right
into
Journalism
II
because
she
knew
we
had
it
in
us
to
handle
the
challenge.
Without
any
hesitation,
I
was
in.
My
junior
year
was
when
it
was
all
going
to
happen.
Walking
into
the
room
junior
year,
I
felt
small,
intimidated
by
the
older
students
and
the
teacher
that
put
me
in
this
class.
With
a
small
budget
and
practically
no
students,
Journalism
II
was
in
charge
of
producing
the
school
newspaper.
I
was
the
quiet
one
who
wrote
decent
editorials
and
columns.
I
never
said
much,
though
expressed
myself
and
my
many
ideas
through
my
writing.
I
wrote
and
wrote
and
wrote,
and
began
to
feel
like
I
could
get
used
to
this
class.
Little
did
I
know
that
it
was
going
to
change
my
life.
As
the
year
progressed,
I
became
more
and
more
involved
with
the
activities
of
the
class.
I
was
captivated
by
Journalism
and
felt
that
perhaps
I
had
finally
found
my
niche
as
a
writer.
It
wasn't
just
the
writing
that
I
enjoyed,
though
expressing
my
opinions
and
seeing
my
words
come
alive
in
print
always
excited
me,
but
it
was
also
the
production
of
the
paper.
Doing
it
all
by
hand,
we
worked
together,
cutting,
pasting,
cropping,
to
make
a
newspaper
that
was
attractive
to
the
eye
and
stimulating
to
the
mind.
I
began
to
feel
more
at
ease
in
these
surroundings,
not
feeling
as
intimidated
by
my
older
peers,
who
had
had
more
experience
than
me.
I
looked
up
to
the
two
editors
and
held
such
great
respect
for
them.
I
would
sometimes
imagine
myself
standing
in
front
of
the
room
and
giving
people
orders,
but
always
felt
more
secure
in
my
seat
getting
the
orders.
However,
I
was
having
to
fight
against
my
shyness,
given
that
interviewing
and
"digging"
for
stories
are
essential
parts
of
the
world
of
journalism.
This
class
was
working
wonders
for
myself
and
yet,
at
the
time,
I
was
totally
unaware
of
the
impact
it
was
having
on
me.
I
remember
the
first
time
I
really
took
control
and
laid
out
my
own
double-page
spread.
I
sat
quietly
in
the
comer
and
made
a
professional
looking
layout
that
impressed
Mrs.
Faunce
as
much
as
it
impressed
me.
My
skills
were
developing
quickly
and
I
felt
so
rewarded
each
time
I
completed
a
story
or
page.
This
is
not
to
say,
however,
that
I
didn't
suffer
through
rough
times
and
stress
too.
Frustration
was
common
on
deadline
days,
yet
I
never
felt
enveloped
by
it,
knowing
that,
in
the
end,
the
responsibility
was
in
the
hands
of
the
editors
and
Mrs.
Faunce.
As
I
diligently
did
my
part,
I
began
to
experience
feelings
of
achievement,
importance,
if
you
will.
Although
I
was
only
a
small
piece
of
the
larger
puzzle
that
made
up
our
newspaper
team,
my
self-esteem
was
rising.
Feelings
of
excitement
and
curiosity
of
what
was
to
come
next
coursed
through
myself
as
I
started
each
new
day.
School
was
no
longer
boring.
The
year
was
drawing
to
an
end.
"Anyone
interested
in
being
editor-in-chief
next
year
must
write
me
a
letter
telling
me
why
and
your
qualifications,"
Mrs.
Faunce
announced.
I
was
instantly
taken
back
by
my
initial
reaction
to
this
statement.
I
wanted
it,
I
wanted
it
so
bad
that
I
could
taste
it.
I
couldn't
imagine
actually
doing
it,
becoming
the
editor,
but
everything
in
my
body
was
telling
me
to
go
for
it.
Mrs.
Faunce
then
continued,
"Next
year,
Journalism
will
also
be
in
charge
of
producing
the
yearbook
as
well
as
the
newspaper,
which
will
be
done
on
Pagemaker
rather
than
by
hand."
"The
yearbook,
too?"
I
thought.
The
idea
electrified
me
even
more!
My
mind
was
made
up.
I
wrote
Mrs.
Faunce
a
letter
with
all
the
sincerity
in
my
heart,
and
then
had
the
summer
to
wait
for
her
response.
My
senior
year
was
finally
here.
After
about
one
week
of
planning,
getting
organized
and
settled
in
to
the
Journalism
class,
the
day
came.
I
didn't
have
Journalism
until
last
period
so
all
day
I
waited
in
hopeful
suspense
for
the
editors
for
the
1997
Pioneer
and
Key
to
be
revealed.
Since
there
were
two
sections
of
Journalism
this
year,
there
were
to
be
two
co-editors.
Could
I
be
one
of
them?
The
walk
down
the
long,
crowded
corridors
of
my
high
school
seemed
to
go
in
slow
motion.
My
hands
sweat
and
my
body
shook
with
anticipation.
When
I
came
to
the
door,
I
suddenly
stopped,
motionless.
A
big,
eye-catching,
computer
typed
sign
read
"The
1996-97
Editors-In-Chief
for
the
Pioneer
and
Key
are
Jamie
Seher
and
Seymour."
A
wave
of
absolute
happiness
came
over
me.
As
I
walked
into
the
classroom,
I
was
greeted
by
the
smiling
eyes
of
my
peers
and
a
gleaming
smile
from
Mrs.
Faunce.
I
had
done
it.
But
the
challenge
had
not
even
begun
yet.
From
that
point
on,
the
true
power
of
language
and
leadership
came
into
my
life.
Suddenly,
I
had
a
million
responsibilities
and
held
"the
most
prestigious
position
in
the
school,"
so
said
Mrs.
Faunce.
I
quickly
learned
how
to
be
a
leader,
how
to
direct
others,
and
even
stand
in
front
of
the
class
and
give
orders.
Perhaps
the
most
important,
yet
seemingly
small,
aspect
of
my
job
was
my
duty
to
write
editorials
for
our
monthly
paper.
This
was
my
time
to
fully
express
my
opinions,
thoughts,
ideas,
and
feelings
through
my
written
words.
I
wrote
about
everything
and
anything
that
was
on
my
mind.
Throughout
the
year,
certain
editorials
that
I
had
written
actually
were
having
an
impact
on
the
school.
I
was
making
a
difference
and
the
power
of
my
words
was
reaching
new
lengths.
Journalism
and
all
it
involves
has
become
a
part
of
me.
It
was
more
than
just
a
class,
it
was
a
lesson
about
life
itself.
Not
only
did
I
learn
how
to
communicate
responsibly
through
words,
I
learned
the
power
of
language.
My
written
words
had
the
ability
to
make
a
difference
in
my
school
and
my
spoken
words
lead
an
entire
class.
Because
of
this
experience,
I
evolved
from
a
somewhat
inhibited
girl
who
could
express
herself
through
writing
into
a
strong-willed,
confident
editor-in-chief.
Looking
back
on
it
now,
I
am
proud
of
my
achievements.
The
impact
this
form
of
language
and
expression
has
had
on
my
life
is
immeasurable.
What
I
brought
with
me
as
I
entered
college
was
the
concept
of
writing
for
my
own
self-improvement,
not
just
for
a
grade
on
paper.
Each
time
I
write,
no
matter
for
what
subject,
I
exert
my
passion
and
my
love
for
writing.
Although
I
had
much
to
learn
about
writing
on
a
college
level,
the
one
the
thing
that
I
knew
already
was
that
there
is
so
much
more
to
writing
than
just
following
the
directions
-
a
notion
that
I
had
when
I
was
a
little
girl.
My
First
Year
Seminar
class
and
my
First
Year
Writing
class
both
taught
me
how
to
write
on
a
more
analytical
level
and
I
realized
that
the
writing
I
had
been
doing
in
high
school
was
just
barely
breaking
the
surface.
I
still
have
much
to
learn,
and
college
is
the
place
where
I
hope
to
turn
this
passion
into
a
future.
There
is
one
thing
I
know
for
sure
-
this
is
a
fire
that
will
never
go
out,
no
matter
what
the
future
holds
in
store
for
me.
