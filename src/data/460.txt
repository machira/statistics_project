Literacy
Narrative
I
was
never
a
great
writer
growing
up.
In
fact
it
was
my
worst
subject.
I
should
clarify
that
statement.
When
I
entered
high
school,
and
the
papers
were
longer,
the
subjects
were
harder
and
the
teachers
expected
more
organization
from
my
writing,
English
became
my
worst
subject.
Playing
the
guitar
since
I
was
seven,
I
have
always
been
writing
lyrics
or
poems
in
a
songbook.
Obviously
these
works
were
never
published
and
they
were
simply
for
my
own
reading
no
one
else.
However,
it
was
high
school
where
the
problems
all
started.
I
had
a
horrible
English
teacher,
who
would
mark
FOs
on
my
papers
with
no
explanation,
publicly
humiliate
students,
and
made
me
fear
writing
in
general.
This
is
why
I
became
a
WA
two
semesters
agoNto
help
those
who
came
into
college
scared
like
me.
The
most
recent
time
I
have
been
afraid
of
writing
and
the
English
language
was
my
first
WA
conference.
After
a
long
battle
trying
to
meet
with
the
professor
for
my
FYS,
and
receiving
20
papers
on
a
subject
I
had
no
familiarity
with,
it
was
time
for
my
first
conference
as
a
WA.
I
had
read
the
5
papers
for
the
students
that
were
scheduled
to
come
in
on
that
Tuesday
evening.
I
even
used
different
colors
to
show
them
different
things;
green
means
grammar,
blue
means
spelling,
purple
means
subject.
I
arrived
to
the
WA
room
10
minutes
early
to
stake
out
my
spot.
There
were
3
WAOs
in
the
room
having
conferences,
so
I
chose
a
spot
close
to
the
back
of
the
room.
My
first
conference
in
my
Writing
Associate
career
was
a
no-show.
I
felt
personally
offended
by
this.
I
started
to
think,
maybe
word
got
out,
and
maybe
they
all
think
I
am
not
good
enough
for
this
job.
As
I
was
feeling
sorry
for
myself
and
terrified
that
maybe
I
had
gotten
into
something
that
was
over
my
head,
my
second
conference
strolled
through
the
doors.
It
was
all
or
nothing
here.
I
had
to
prove
my
worth,
prove
to
myself
that
I
was
a
good
writer
and
that
these
first
year
students
could
trust
me
to
get
them
through
their
FYS.
The
conference
started
off
with
a
few
questions,
Nhow
are
you?O,
NHow
are
your
classes?O
After
all
I
got
were
one-word
answers
I
turned
to
talking
about
the
paper.
Once
we
started
talking
about
the
paper
that
is
where
my
first
challenge
was
presented.
She
asked
me,
NWhat
is
your
writing
style?
How
do
you
do
it?O
I
was
thrown
off
guard,
I
thought
to
myself;
I
am
the
one
that
is
supposed
to
be
asking
the
questions
here
not
you.
As
I
sat
there
for
a
second
and
thought,
at
first
I
was
not
sure
I
had
a
style
or
an
actual
process.
I
dodged
the
question
at
first
and
dove
into
her
paper
with
her.
I
explained
the
coloring
system
and
then
showed
her
that
I
do
not
use
the
color
red
when
marking
papers
because
I
find
it
to
be
threatening.
The
conference
progressed
into
her
telling
me
that
she
really
did
not
know
how
to
make
her
paper
flow
and
how
to
express
her
ideas
clearly.
I
showed
her
a
strategy
by
making
a
little
chart
on
the
back
of
the
paper.
NWithout
being
too
formulaic
start
off
with
a
broad
idea
or
concept
then
refine
it
to
a
specific
topic
or
subject,
similar
to
the
look
of
an
hourglassE.O
After
I
was
done
explaining
and
she
was
smiling
and
said,
Nwow
that
will
make
this
a
lot
easier,
why
didnOt
I
think
of
writing
like
that?O,
I
realized
that
I
was
going
to
be
a
good
WA
and
that
I
did
have
a
style
of
writing
after
all.
The
reset
of
the
conferences
went
well.
All
of
them
had
the
same
type
of
question
and
concerns
with
their
papers.
Not
only
did
the
conferences
help
my
FYS
students,
but
they
helped
me
in
many
ways
as
well.
From
reading
the
students
papers
I
became
a
more
active
reader
of
my
own
work.
I
remember
reading
an
article
professor
Seetch
gave
us
at
the
training
last
year
about
writing
to
a
specific
audience
and
finding
that
I
would
write
to
a
specific
reader
each
time
I
wrote
a
paper.
Being
a
WA
helped
me
strengthen
my
writing
style
and
eliminate
a
lot
of
my
procrastination
problems.
Now
when
I
write
a
paper
I
start
writing
with
plenty
of
time
to
re-read
it,
edit
it,
and
walk
away
from
it.
I
found
it
was
a
lot
easier
to
preach
once
you
have
practiced
this
yourself.
After
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
I
embarked
on
a
journey
to
study
abroad
in
London,
England
for
my
spring
semester.
I
was
extremely
nervous
to
start
my
semester
in
England
because
of
the
language
barrier.
This
may
sound
strange
to
say
there
is
a
language
barrier
in
a
place
where
they
speak
English,
however,
their
style
of
writing
and
speaking
are
completely
different
than
ours
here
in
the
states.
When
I
received
my
schedule
for
the
semester
I
had
two
writing
courses.
One
of
the
first
differences
in
their
expectations
for
the
writing
courses
was
a
word
count
limit.
In
the
U.S.
I
was
used
to
a
page
limit,
i.e.
write
a
3-page
paper
onE
however
in
England
they
ask
for
a
1000
word
essay.
Once,
I
started
writing
my
paper,
I
found
that
I
was
using
the
principles
and
techniques
that
I
laid
out
for
my
students
during
conferences.
I
think
most
important
tool
I
gained
from
being
a
WA
was
to
use
my
community
around
me.
In
England
I
used
my
friends
as
readers
and
relied
on
them
to
make
critiques
on
my
work.
This
is
one
of
the
single
most
important
elements
in
writing.
I
have
found
my
writing
has
improved
ten
fold
when
I
started
having
my
friends
and
others
around
me
read
my
work
and
give
me
suggestions.
Coming
back
to
campus
I
am
looking
forward
to
having
the
WA
community
around
me
to
help
and
guide
me
in
my
own
writing.
As
a
veteran
WA,
I
am
looking
forward
to
being
a
part
of
the
college
writing
program
and
the
WA
community.
Although,
the
job
seems
easyNjust
reading
papers
and
telling
students
what
they
need
to
improve
onNit
is
so
much
more
demanding
than
meets
the
eye.
Being
a
WA
forces
you
to
have
time
management,
interaction
with
faculty,
active
reading
skills
and
many
other
skills.
Obviously
this
job
is
not
for
everyone.
However,
if
you
have
been
selected
to
be
a
WA
you
have
passed
the
test
put
forth
by
the
College
Writing
Program
administrators.
This
is
not
an
easy
task
being
part
of
this
elite
group
of
writers
and
thinkers.
There
were
many
struggles
for
me
to
overcome
as
a
first
year
WA.
I
also
had
a
class
that
had
two
English
Language
Learners.
This
was
particularly
difficult
for
me
because
I
did
not
know
how
much
I
could
teach
them
about
our
language
in
a
30
minute
conference.
However,
I
think
that
these
two
students
made
the
job
more
rewarding.
When
they
first
had
conferences
with
me,
their
papers
were
all
over
the
place.
No
idea
flowed
into
the
next,
grammar
was
wrong,
verb
tense,
content
structure,
etc.
When
they
each
had
their
last
WA
conference
with
me,
their
papers
were
well
written,
had
flow
to
them,
and
made
sense
content-wise.
Although
it
seemed
like
there
would
be
no
light
at
the
end
of
that
tunnel,
we
all
got
through
it
together.
That
is
one
of
the
most
rewarding
experiences
about
this
job.
What
do
I
look
forward
to
in
the
future?
I
look
forward
to
the
same
anxiety
that
plagues
me
just
before
the
first
conference.
I
look
forward
to
having
a
conference
that
not
only
changes
the
students
writing
style
but
also
mine.
I
am
looking
forward
to
welcoming
the
new
WAOs
into
our
community
and
having
them
as
a
resource.
Just
as
we
are
growing
physically,
emotionally,
and
mentally
in
college,
so
to,
is
our
writing,
writing
style,
and
are
ability
to
recognize
othersO
writing
and
style.
I
am
grateful
to
have
an
opportunity
like
this,
where,
I
can
help
others
around
me
succeed.
