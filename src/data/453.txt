BENJAMIN
ARTHUR
LITERACY
NARRATIVE
WRITING
ASSOCIATE
WORKSHOP
I
was
born
in
Ghana,
a
country
on
the
West
coast
of
Africa,
where
I
acquired
all
my
primary
and
high
school
education.
Growing
through
school,
I
never
found
writing
as
much
of
a
means
of
free
expression
as
I
found
it
to
be
a
grueling
and
painful
chore.
Even
though
I
considered
it
a
chore,
I
do
not
remember
comparing
it
to
doing
dishes,
sweeping
or
any
of
my
other
daily
household
NafflictionO.
It
was
a
chore
of
a
different
kind.
The
other
chores
I
did
could
easily
be
done
and
required
less
brain
work
but
not
writing;
Writing
had
rules
and
the
hardest
thing
I
learned
was
that
in
order
to
even
obey
the
rules
of
writing
you
had
to
first
discover
what
they
were.
Yet
surprisingly
it
appeared
that
some
of
the
essays
I
would
churn
out
in
primary
school
would
score
good
grades.
I
am
yet
to
analyze
and
understand
whether
it
was
because
I
was
following
the
correct
rules
for
writing,
or
rather
reproducing
what
at
the
time
constituted
good
writing
for
a
person
my
age.
Despite
receiving
praise
for
some
of
my
work,
I
still
found
writing
to
be
such
a
painful
job.
Looking
back
these
days,
I
wonder
why
I
decided
I
did
not
like
to
write;
I
wonder
why
writing
was
such
a
task
when
it
appeared
I
could
write
in
a
way
that
others
appreciated.
For
a
long
time
people
told
me
that
my
writing
was
good
so
I
felt
a
need
to
either
keep
the
reputation
or
improve
upon
it.
In
trying
to
improve
I
found
myself
struggling
with
every
piece
of
writing
that
I
did.
My
focus
was
not
on
what
I
had
to
say,
it
was
always
on
how
to
say
what
I
had
to
say.
I
wrote
to
impress
and
would
not
settle
for
anything
less
and
this
made
writing
such
a
task
for
me.
I
remember
my
childhood
years
when
I
first
started
to
write
the
alphabets
using
a
chalk
and
a
little
black
slate
board.
I
was
about
four
or
five
years
old
at
the
time.
My
mother
would
hold
my
hand
and
try
to
help
me
form
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
as
best
as
I
could.
I
remember
her
trying
hard
to
make
me
write
a
P
instead
of
a
9.
She
struggled
to
help
me
remember
to
write
my
C
facing
the
correct
way
and
occasionally
would
get
impatient
with
me
when
my
small
B
was
always
a
small
D.
I
rested
not,
because
I
wanted
to
get
it
right.
Even
then
as
a
child,
I
questioned
why
I
was
doing
what
I
was
doing.
Sometimes
I
would
get
tired
and
would
stop
trying
altogether.
Other
times
I
will
be
sad
and
may
shed
a
few
tears
because
I
could
not
understand
why
I
was
just
not
getting
it
right.
My
occasional
desperation
however,
did
not
deter
me
from
taking
the
slate
and
the
chalk
again
the
next
day
to
try
again.
Perhaps
as
a
child,
I
believed
my
mother
had
good
intentions
for
wanting
to
see
me
write
well.
And
even
though
I
did
not
understand
what
I
was
doing,
my
little
childOs
brain
subconsciously
accepted
that
there
was
a
good
reason
to
learn
to
write
and
write
properly.
In
elementary
school,
I
encountered
some
criticisms
about
the
way
I
wrote
from
both
friends
and
family.
Interestingly
enough,
the
criticisms
were
more
aesthetically-based
than
content-based.
The
complaint,
NYour
handwriting
is
too
big!O
What
does
the
size
of
my
handwriting
have
to
do
with
anything?
I
wondered.
Some
people
write
small,
others
write
big.
Yet
even
then,
my
non-conformist
attitude
did
little
to
energize
me
to
resist.
Perhaps
the
real
reason
for
not
rebelling
was
because
I
had
no
power
of
my
own
to
act
independently.
Instead,
I
found
myself
trying
hard
to
adjust
the
size
of
my
letters.
I
tried
so
hard
that
in
high
school,
the
very
people
who
complained
that
I
write
too
big
were
complaining
that
I
write
too
small.
I
wonder
why
I
chose
to
believe
that
others
knew
best
and
was
willing
to
make
all
that
adjustment.
Of
course
others
do
read
what
you
write
and
you
write
usually
for
an
audience
but
what
is
more
important;
what
you
have
to
say
and
how
you
say
it
or
how
it
appears
on
paper.
At
that
stage
of
my
life,
how
it
appeared
seemed
like
the
most
important
part
of
writing
at
least
to
those
who
saw
my
writing.
When
I
graduated
from
writing
with
a
piece
of
chalk,
I
moved
on
to
using
pencils
and
then
later
to
writing
with
pens.
I
began
writing
with
pens
when
I
was
in
fourth
grade.
I
noticed
that
some
pens
made
my
handwriting
bold
and
clear
whiles
others
seemed
to
make
my
handwriting
appear
horribly
messy.
At
the
time
it
seemed
like
all
the
people
who
wrote
nicely
always
got
great
grades.
So
I
determined
to
write
as
nicely
as
I
could.
This
decision
in
turn
predicted
my
choice
of
a
pen
to
use
for
my
work.
What
is
more,
we
were
being
schooled
to
write
essays
in
a
mechanistic
and
routine
fashion
at
the
time
so
what
one
had
to
say
in
an
essay
was
not
very
important.
Subsequently,
all
one
had
to
do
was
grasp
the
mechanics
and
garnish
them
with
a
beautiful
handwriting
to
receive
the
A
they
desired.
In
middle
school,
the
technicalities
of
essay
writing
had
become
a
part
of
me
in
the
way
I
approached
essays.
The
routine
introduction,
body
and
conclusion
format
for
essay
writing
was
for
me
the
non-negotiable
of
essays.
I
had
mastered
this
rule
very
well
with
the
help
of
a
few
essay
booklets
I
received
as
gifts
from
my
grandma
who
was
once
a
primary
school
teacher.
She
was
very
particularly
instrumental
in
instilling
in
me
the
need
to
have
an
education.
Sometimes
I
wondered,
NWhat
is
this
woman
talking
about?O
When
she
would
talk
about
how
blessed
we
are
to
be
having
the
opportunity
to
go
to
school
since
it
was
a
struggle
for
her
to
go
to
school
when
she
was
young.
She
was
willing
to
sell
everything
she
owned
to
make
sure
all
her
children
went
to
school,
she
once
told
me.
As
the
years
passed
and
the
time
came
for
me
to
enter
secondary
school
or
High
school,
I
felt
quite
confident
about
my
writing
capabilities.
I
was
sure
I
was
going
to
take
everything
easily
at
that
level
too.
Up
till
then,
the
only
writings
I
had
been
exposed
to
were
simple
three-paragraph
descriptive,
narrative
and
letter-type
essays
which
detailed
very
little
in
their
contents.
I
was
very
ill-prepared
for
the
longer
narratives,
passages,
and
paragraph
summaries
we
were
tasked
with
in
High
school.
In
the
beginning
I
struggled
with
the
essay
tasks.
I
was
so
accustomed
to
finishing
everything
in
three
paragraphs
that
I
literally
ran
out
of
things
to
write
beyond
the
third
paragraph.
All
of
a
sudden,
it
felt
as
if
all
the
rules
I
had
adhered
to,
the
laws
I
had
abided
by
to
win
essay
competitions,
were
not
helping
much
at
this
stage
of
my
writing
experience.
This
was
the
birth
of
my
resentment
towards
writing
long
essays
exceeding
three
paragraphs,
as
essay
after
I
say
I
submitted
received
average
grades.
My
devastation
worsened
when
in
attempt
to
impress
my
English
teacher,
I
began
to
use
elaborate
words
to
garnish
my
essays
but
still
received
average
grades.
I
did
not
usually
reread
my
essays
to
correct
my
own
mistakes
much
less
let
anyone
read
them.
Letting
people
read
my
essay,
I
thought,
was
not
exactly
the
coolest
thing
to
do.
I
felt
proof-reading
was
too
much
trouble.
I
also
felt
it
was
a
little
embarrassing
to
have
someone
read
and
notice
I
had
made
a
mistake
in
my
essays.
Moreover,
it
was
very
possible
that
another
person
could
steal
the
ideas
I
had
worked
hard
to
put
on
paper
and
make
it
their
own.
It
took
me
a
long
time
to
put
a
single
sentence
together
since
I
would
take
a
while
reforming
and
reconstructing
it
in
my
head
till
I
came
up
with
what
I
considered
to
be
the
best.
Hence,
I
was
not
willing
to
allow
anyone
to
deride
it
much
less
steal
it.
The
first
time
I
actually
had
someone
read
my
essay,
was
when
I
was
applying
for
colleges.
Even
then
I
had
already
mailed
it
in
so
his
comments
were
not
going
to
matter.
I
allowed
my
close
friend
to
read
a
copy
of
my
personal
statement
to
one
of
the
colleges
I
was
applying
to
and
I
let
him
read
it
after
much
insistence
from
him.
Before
he
began
reading
it,
I
purposed
in
my
mind
that
I
was
not
going
to
care
whatever
his
comments
were.
I
had
an
understanding
of
writing
to
be
such
a
private
thing.
Any
writing,
apart
from
those
that
were
to
be
published
in
the
media,
to
me,
were
personal
treasures
meant
for
their
ownersO
eyes
only.
As
I
listened
to
him
critique
my
paper,
I
began
to
feel
a
little
uneasy
and
embarrassed.
I
felt
as
if
I
was
being
stripped
naked
in
front
of
a
crowd
and
he
was
the
one
tearing
off
my
clothes.
I
sat
in
silence
as
one
by
one
he
tore
of
my
clothes
of
writing
errors
leaving
me
cold
and
naked.
In
the
end
I
almost
felt
as
though
I
had
regretted
letting
him
read
my
paper.
Here
I
stood
with
no
other
alternative
than
to
wait
for
the
college
to
make
their
admission
decision
but
at
the
same
time
wishing
I
had
an
opportunity
to
make
the
changes
my
friend
was
suggesting
and
implementing
some
of
the
ideas
he
had.
This
was
a
really
painful
slap
on
my
face.
I
had
finally
realized
the
need
for
proof-reading
and
peer
review
of
essays
and
I
had
learned
it
the
hard
way.
Fortunately
for
me,
my
personal
statement
was
good
enough
to
get
me
into
Lafayette
College
to
begin
another
phase
of
my
education.
I
was
not
going
to
leave
the
lessons
I
had
painfully
learned
behind,
however,
at
the
same
time
I
feared
I
needed
to
establish
some
sort
of
closeness
before
I
could
trust
anyone
to
read
my
essays
since
I
still
harbored
the
thought
that
writing
was
very
private.
While
waiting
to
enter
College,
I
developed
an
interest
for
writing
poetry
mainly
because
a
friend
of
mine
wrote
poems
and
he
was
very
good
with
developing
rhyme
schemes.
I
realized
in
a
short
while
after
a
little
practice
that
finding
something
to
say
or
write
about
in
a
poem
came
so
naturally
for
me.
Even
though
I
realized
I
wrote
fairly
accurate
rhymes,
I
feared
being
broken
by
someone
who
thought
them
amateurish
or
just
plain.
With
this
fear,
my
poems
were
never
read
by
anyone
until
I
entered
College.
In
college
I
was
to
learn
that
letting
others
read
your
work
is
an
important
key
to
opening
the
doors
of
clear
and
understandable
writing
pieces.
My
first
semester
at
Lafayette
required
that
I
took
a
first
year
seminar.
The
title
of
the
seminar
I
ended
up
taking
was
NThe
European
UnionO
(EU).
It
was
a
lot
of
fun
learning
about
an
organization
that
I
knew
very
little
about
but
a
lot
of
trepidation
came
when
it
was
time
to
churn
out
papers.
Coming
from
another
country
I
found
myself
wondering
what
to
do
when
my
first
writing
assignment
was
handed
out
to
me;
I
was
supposed
to
choose
one
of
the
member
countries
of
the
EU
to
profile.
I
remember
wondering
if
there
was
a
correct
or
wrong
way
to
go
about
it.
It
required
some
researching
and
reading
some
books
to
obtain
facts,
something
I
had
never
really
done.
In
essence,
I
felt
my
high
school
writing
experience
had
not
prepared
me
adequately
enough
to
face
this
challenge.
Most
of
the
writing
assignments
I
did
in
high
school
were
creative
writing
and
descriptive
writing
and
they
did
not
require
much
research.
I
took
up
the
challenge
to
make
a
switch
to
do
careful
research
rather
hesitantly
and
came
up
with
a
draft
for
the
first
assignment
after
much
struggle.
I
was
happy
to
learn,
however,
that
someone,
a
writing
associate
(WA),
was
to
read
the
draft
and
give
her
input.
I
was
happy
to
meet
with
the
WA
to
discuss
my
draft.
We
had
previously
met
to
discuss
a
short
in-class
writing
that
the
professor
for
my
seminar
had
assigned
the
first
day
in
class.
During
the
discussion
of
that
in-class
assignment,
I
realized
that
even
though
I
was
a
little
nervous
about
her
possibly
giving
me
negative
feed
back
about
my
work
I
was
happy
to
learn
that
it
was
help
she
was
actually
giving
me
to
make
my
writing
more
accurate.
Besides
the
help
from
the
WA,
the
professor
of
my
class
occasionally
made
us
exchange
drafts
in
class
so
that
we
could
get
some
feed
back
from
our
class
mates.
The
help
from
the
WA
and
the
feed
back
from
the
professor
and
my
class
mates
did
a
lot
to
get
me
through
the
class
successfully.
So
far
my
best
writing
experience
in
college
has
been
in
my
College
writing
course
which
I
took
during
the
spring
semester
of
my
freshman
year.
I
discovered
for
the
first
time
through
discussions
online
and
in
class
that
writing
is
a
tool
for
expression
instead
of
a
chore.
I
came
to
grips
with
the
fact
that
one
can
control
their
own
writing
and
essentially
own
it;
that
by
writing
and
rewriting
you
get
an
opportunity
to
think
and
rethink
your
ideas
to
be
sure
you
are
saying
what
you
want
to
say
in
a
piece
and
making
others
understand
what
exactly
you
intend
to
say
without
ambiguity.
My
application
of
my
experience
thus
far
has
certainly
made
writing
less
gruesome
and
mean
to
me.
I
find
myself
happy
to
attempt
to
write
a
piece
on
almost
any
topic
without
failing.
The
proudest
moment
about
writing
for
me
is
when
the
work
is
finished
and
I
can
say
this
is
my
work,
my
ideas
and
my
effort.
My
understanding
thus
far,
is
that
writing
is
like
a
fingerprint-
Unique.
Hence
no
matter
what
the
topic
or
how
similar
or
different
the
views
on
the
topic
are,
writing
is
the
one
means
by
which
anyone
and
everyone
can
put
their
signature
on
their
own
disposition.
