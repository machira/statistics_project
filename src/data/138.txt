Literacy
Narrative
August
12,
1997
I
realize,
as
I
sit
at
my
desk
in
my
bedroom
composing
the
third
and
final
portion
of
my
Literacy
Narrative,
that
I
am
in
the
same
house
and
even
the
same
room
as
I
was
when
I
wrote
both
my
global
history
and
the
addendum
to
that
history
two
years
ago
and
one
summer
ago,
respectively;
however,
as
a
student
entering
my
senior
year
of
college
and
beginning
my
third
year
as
a
writing
associate,
I
write
from
a
markedly
different
perspective.
Having
completed
in
just
last
year
alone
courses
in
the
departments
of
philosophy,
government,
English,
Spanish,
art
and
sociology--
courses
in
which
each
professor
had
different
expectations
of
his/her
students
and
in
turn
imposed
different
demands
upon
these
student-writers,
I
now
approach
the
writing
process
in
a
more
organized
fashion
and
with
more
confidence.
Throughout
my
junior
year--
a
year
which
would
be
best
characterized
by
both
the
incredible
quantity
of
writing
I
was
required
to
produce
and
by
the
variety
of
assignments
with
which
I
was
faced--
I
developed
my
own
personal
approach
to
writing.
This
approach
would
begin
with
my
reading
the
assignment
several
times,
discussing
it
with
others
and
taking
extensive
notes
from
whatever
text
accompanied
the
assignment
and
would
end
with
my
composing
a
preliminary
draft
by
hand,
then
transferring
it
to
the
word
processor
and
later
editing
it
repeatedly.
Although
I
perfected
this
process
almost
to
a
science,
I
found
that
each
assignment
provided
me
with
a
new
and
different
opportunity
to
expand
as
a
writer.
That
my
own
writing
has
matured
in
just
one
year
and
with
each
assignment
reinforces
the
notion
that
each
individual
has
his/her
own
history
as
a
writer,
one
that
is
composed
of
his/her
own
writing
experiences
and,
as
such,
one
that
is
ever-changing.
The
fall
semester
of
my
junior
year
proved
to
be
the
most
challenging
semester
I
have
experienced
as
an
undergraduate
student.
Although
one
may
assume
that
this
particular
semester
was
so
demanding
simply
because
I
was
enrolled
in
a
greater
percentage
of
higher-level
courses
than
I
had
been
in
my
freshman
and
sophomore
years,
I
think
the
difficulty
resulted
in
large
part
from
the
fact
that
each
and
every
course
required
a
great
deal
of
writing.
With
each
individual
course
imposing
such
demands,
the
combination
of
these
five
courses
created
a
semester
filled
with
an
extraordinary
amount
of
writing.
Perhaps
the
most
conventional
writing
assignment
of
the
semester
appeared
in
the
twentieth-century
poetry
class
in
which
I
was
enrolled.
Though
there
were
established
requirements
regarding
the
basic
elements
of
these
papers,
such
as
page
length,
there
were
no
such
requirements
directing
the
content
of
the
papers.
The
instructor
simply
required
that
we
choose
and
analyze
an
element
of
one
of
the
assigned
poetic
sequences.
Although
this
leniency
provided
a
pleasant
respite
from
the
rigid
guidelines
often
imposed
upon
students
and
thus
an
opportunity
to
employ
our
creativity
and
expand
upon
what
we
found
interesting,
I
initially
found
the
open-ended
nature
of
these
assignments
to
be
challenging
and,
in
some
respects,
intimidating.
Although
I
have
always
been
more
at
ease
responding
to
those
assignments
which
state
clearly
the
teacher's
expectations,
I
ultimately
developed
a
technique
that
enabled
me
to
approach
the
somewhat
daunting
task
of
selecting
a
topic
and
creating
a
thesis
more
or
less
from
scratch.
I
learned
that
consulting
some
outside
source,
such
as
a
literary
criticism
or
review,
furnished
some
sort
of
starting
point.
Whether
the
source
provided
me
with
an
insight
with
which
I
could
agree
or
disagree
or
with
a
point
of
interest
concerning
some
aspect
of
the
text
or
author
in
question,
I
was
able
to
incorporate
that
outside
source
in
the
introduction
or
body
of
the
paper
or
at
least
to
use
it
as
a
foundation
for
brainstorming.
In
addition,
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
have
had
this
professor
in
my
sophomore
year
as
well
and,
throughout
the
course
of
my
interactions
with
her,
to
have
discovered
that
she
is
extremely
responsive
to
concerns
raised
by
students.
Thus,
not
only
did
I
feel
comfortable
approaching
her
with
matters
concerning
my
writing,
but
I
also
had
some
knowledge
of
the
way
in
which
she
evaluates
work
submitted
by
students.
In
other
words,
I
was
familiar
with
the
audience
for
which
I
was
writing.
As
I
realized
that
this
familiarity
facilitated
the
writing
of
these
papers,
I
came
to
appreciate
the
importance
of
a
writer's
developing
an
understanding
of
his/her
audience
and
of
the
audience's
expectations.
Since
the
professor
who
taught
the
fall
section
of
Ethics
gave
us
the
option
of
responding
to
one
of
the
questions
she
had
formulated
or
of
developing
our
own
topic,
we
were
fairly
unrestricted
in
choosing
our
subject
matter
in
this
class
as
well.
Requiring
that
I
engage
in
a
process
of
reasoning
with
which
I
was
not
familiar,
these
take-home
essay
exams,
which
introduced
me
to
the
discipline
of
philosophic
writing,
provided
a
challenge
distinct
from
the
initial
task
of
selecting
a
topic.
After
briefly
summarizing
a
view
held
by
a
particular
philosopher,
we
were
to
disclose
a
weakness
in
that
theorist's
argument,
to
indicate
any
implications
that
this
flaw
might
have
for
the
argument
in
general
and,
lastly,
to
determine
whether
the
apparent
inconsistency
could
be
reconciled.
Because
it
was
important
that
the
premises
of
my
argument
lead
logically
to
the
conclusion,
I
found
myself
concentrating
especially
on
the
organization
of
the
sentences
within
a
paragraph
and
of
the
paragraphs
throughout
the
paper.
Interestingly,
I
found
that
in
my
effort
to
convey
this
methodical
process
of
reasoning,
my
writing
became
more
succinct.
Although
writing
in
this
new
discipline
forced
me
to
depart
from
my
ordinary
lengthy
and
descriptive
style
of
writing,
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
working
on
these
assignments.
The
most
frustrating
writing
experience
I
encountered
during
the
semester
occurred
in
a
government
course,
Liberty
in
the
United
States:
Law
and
Politics.
The
professor
divided
the
class
into
groups
of
three;
each
group
was
required
to
complete
four
separate
papers
during
the
semester.
Though
the
instructor
assumed
that
each
of
us
would
do
a
portion
of
the
work
independently
of
the
other
two
group
members,
he
expected
that
the
majority
of
the
written
work
submitted
would
be
the
product
of
a
collaborative
effort.
However,
with
one
group
member
who
failed
to
appear
at
over
half
of
our
scheduled
meetings,
sitting
in
front
of
a
computer
together
to
write
the
papers
was
not
an
option.
Therefore,
we
decided
that
each
of
us
would
write
a
different
section
of
the
paper.
After
adopting
this
approach,
the
only
collaboration
occurred
as
we
divided
the
paper
into
three
sections
and
then
later
as
we
convened
to
compile
a
master
copy.
Sadly,
the
most
interaction
we
had
as
group
members
occurred
as
we
decided
trivial
matters,
such
as
which
font
to
use.
This
unfortunate
outcome
was
not,
however,
the
only
difficulty
the
group
project
presented.
Although
we
had
established
some
guidelines
in
an
attempt
to
give
the
appearance
of
uniformity,
the
papers
that
resulted
inevitably
reflected
the
fact
that
they
were
not
the
result
of
one
combined
group
effort
but
rather
were
a
compilation
of
the
efforts
of
three
individuals.
Moreover,
just
as
each
of
us
displayed
different
styles
of
writing,
each
of
us
had
different
expectations
as
a
student
and
as
a
writer.
Thus,
although
I
could
assume
that
each
of
us
would
hope
for
a
decent
grade,
I
was
unsure
as
to
whether
each
group
member
would
be
willing
to
contribute
the
amount
of
effort
necessary
to
achieve
that
goal.
Unwilling
to
leave
that
to
chance,
I
chose
to
write,
in
addition
to
the
section
which
I
was
assigned,
the
two
other
sections
as
well
and
to
offer
those
two
written
sections
as
supplements
to
what
the
others
had
written.
Realizing
that
as
the
semester
progressed
my
schedule
would
undoubtedly
become
more
hectic
and
thus
that
I
would
not
be
able
to
devote
to
the
subsequent
papers
as
much
time
as
I
had
dedicated
to
the
first
paper,
I
approached
the
professor
with
my
concerns.
Although
I
ultimately
came
to
the
conclusion
that
I
could
not
in
every
instance
add
what
information
I
thought
pertinent
and
could
not
change
every
awkward
phrasing,
I
still
had
a
difficult
time
signing
my
name
to
a
paper
that
I
knew
I
would
never
have
submitted
on
my
own.
This
experience
did
however
reinforce
the
notion
that
every
writer
approaches
an
assignment
differently
and
completes
that
assignment
in
his/her
own
unique
fashion.
The
professor
in
this
writing-intensive
course
also
required
that
we
compose
a
case
note,
which
is
essentially
a
detailed
analysis
of
a
certain
court
decision
and
ruling.
Choosing
a
case
which
considered
the
freedom
of
religion,
a
topic
about
which
thousands
and
thousands
of
pieces
of
writing
have
been
published,
I
was
confronted
first
with
the
task
of
selecting
those
pieces
most
relevant
to
my
topic.
Then
I
had
to
relate
that
research
to
my
own
analysis
of
the
case
at
hand.
I
recall
pouring
over
different
court
decisions
and
law
review
articles
in
an
attempt
to
compose
a
coherent
draft.
Returning
the
preliminary
draft
which
I
had
completed
over
Thanksgiving
break,
the
professor
attached
to
it
three
pages
of
typed
and
single-spaced
comments
which
were
to
serve
as
suggestions
for
change.
Although
I
appreciated
the
feedback,
those
three
pages,
which
were
complete
with
computerized
graphs
and
diagrams,
overwhelmed
me.
Being
on
the
receiving
end
of
such
criticism
from
another
reader
aided
me
in
my
experience
as
a
writing
associate.
Even
though
this
professor
may
have
simply
been
trying
to
encourage
me
to
improve,
his
comments
left
me
feeling
more
insecure
than
confident
about
my
writing
ability.
Drawing
upon
this
experience,
I
thus
was
able
to
comprehend
the
way
in
which
criticism
can
affect
a
writer
and,
reciprocally,
the
importance
of
indicating
strengths
as
well
as
weaknesses
when
evaluating
another
person's
written
work.
Additionally,
I
remember
asking
the
professor
whether
it
was
necessary
or
simply
recommended
that
I
act
upon
all
of
his
suggestions.
The
feelings
of
confusion
I
experienced
in
repose
to
his
numerous
comments
further
demonstrated
that
it
is
important
for
me,
as
a
writing
associate
meeting
with
other
students,
to
concentrate
first
on
those
aspects
of
the
writing
which
truly
involve
higher-order
concerns
and
only
if
time
permits
to
focus
on
lower-order
concerns.
In
another
government
and
law
class
in
which
I
was
enrolled,
Gender
and
the
Law,
I
gained
exposure
to
another
type
of
legal
writing.
In
addition
to
the
several
exams
administered
in
class,
we
were
required
to
write
a
legal
brief.
Provided
with
a
set
of
hypothetical
facts,
we
were
to
assume
the
role
of
advocate
and
thus
to
argue
persuasively
for
our
client.
Representing
a
high
school
accused
of
engaging
in
discriminatory
practices,
I
learned
to
analyze
and
present
in
writing
a
set
of
circumstances
in
a
way
that
was
most
favorable
to
my
client.
Additionally,
I
learned
to
utilize
past
precedent
which
supported
my
client's
position
and
also
to
diminish
the
potentially
harmful
effects
of
past
rulings
which
were
not
in
our
favor.
After
talking
with
individuals
who
have
completed
law
school
and
with
those
who
are
currently
law
school
students,
I
was
surprised
to
learn
that
most
law
school
students
do
not
encounter
this
type
of
writing
until
they
enroll
in
a
legal
writing
course,
a
course
that
virtually
all
law
school
students--
regardless
of
the
institution
they
attend--
must
complete.
They
further
explained
that
I,
having
been
exposed
to
this
discipline,
would
be
at
a
considerable
advantage.
In
the
Spanish
literature
class
in
which
I
was
enrolled,
we
were
assigned
various
readings
dating
as
far
back
as
the
medieval
ages.
Thus,
these
poems
and
dramas
were
difficult
to
interpret
not
only
because
they
were
composed
in
a
foreign
language
but
also
because
they
had
originated
in
a
time
period
about
which
I
had
little
knowledge.
I
found,
however,
that
this
obstacle
was
not
the
only
challenging
circumstance
the
course
would
present.
Unlike
the
professor
of
my
poetry
course
who
allowed
us
to
tackle
virtually
any
aspect
of
a
given
work,
this
professor
explained
that
we
were
to
select
from
one
of
two
or
three
questions
that
had
been
written
by
the
editor
of
the
text
book.
Even
though
the
range
of
questions
from
which
we
were
to
choose
was
relatively
narrow,
I
thought
that
each
question
was
rather
open-ended
and
therefore
that
we
were
free
to
argue
either
for
or
against
a
particular
position.
I
remember
choosing
a
question
which
asked
whether
in
our
opinion
the
author
intended
for
the
work
to
amuse
or
to
teach
a
lesson.
Concluding
that
the
editor's
use
of
the
word
or
indicated
that
the
two
options
were
mutually
exclusive,
I
chose
to
argue
in
favor
of
the
position
that
the
author's
primary
purpose
in
writing
the
short
play
was
to
amuse
the
audience.
In
support
of
my
argument,
I
examined
the
various
literary
techniques
employed
by
the
author,
such
as
hyperbole
and
rhyme,
and
the
humorous
end
the
imposition
of
these
techniques
achieved.
The
professor
returned
to
me
the
once-clean
preliminary
draft;
in
its
place
was
a
paper
now
peppered
with
comments
made
in
red
ink.
Overwhelmed
by
his
response,
I
automatically
assumed
that
I
would
have
to
rewrite
the
paper
completely.
In
an
effort
to
determine
whether
this
was
the
case,
I
approached
the
professor
who
explained
that
I
had
erred
in
concluding
that
because
the
author
utilized
humor
his
purpose
was
to
amuse.
Interpreting
this
explanation
as
a
criticism
of
the
position
for
which
I
had
argued,
I
figured
his
response
affirmed
my
initial
fear,
namely
that
I
would
have
to
start
from
scratch.
However,
after
further
discussion,
I
understood
that
I
could
remedy
the
problem
by
simply
conceding
that
the
story,
while
humorous,
may
in
fact
have
some
educational
value.
My
writing
experiences
in
this
class
not
only
revealed
the
importance
of
listening
to
others
when
engaging
in
a
dialogue
about
writing,
but
also
provided
me
with
an
understanding
of
some
of
the
flaws
commonly
made
by
inexperienced
writers.
For
example,
I
found
when
writing
in
Spanish,
I
often
failed
to
make
transitions
from
sentence
to
sentence
and
from
paragraph
to
paragraph.
Interestingly,
many
of
the
first
year
students
with
whom
I
worked
in
the
fall
semester
experienced
the
same
difficulty;
often
one
sentence
would
proceed
to
the
next
without
any
connection
linking
the
two
logically.
Because
this
was
a
problem
I
encountered
in
many
individual
papers
and
throughout
a
given
paper,
I
not
only
informed
their
professor
but
also
addressed
it
in
each
conference.
Like
my
Spanish
professor
and
unlike
my
English
professor,
the
professor
with
whom
I
worked
during
the
fall
semester
assigned
one
very
specific
issue
which
his
students
were
permitted
to
address.
Restricted
in
this
manner,
the
students
had
difficulty
meeting
the
professor's
expectations.
Sensing
that
they
did
not
understand
the
nature
of
the
assignments,
which
required
that
they
explain
how
politics
and
certain
principles
influenced
a
particular
leader
to
adopt
a
certain
course
of
action,
I
approached
the
professor.
The
professor,
who
was
extremely
responsive
to
my
inquiries,
provided
me
with
an
outline
of
his
class
lecture
and
notes
which
gave
specific
examples
of
political
principles
and
the
way
in
which
they
have
influenced
different
leaders.
Armed
with
this
information,
I
was
able
to
create
a
diagram
which
detailed
the
nature
of
the
assignment.
Using
this
diagram
in
each
conference
to
demonstrate
the
relationship
the
students
were
expected
to
establish-
namely,
the
way
in
which
certain
factors
influence
a
politician's
policies--
I
found
that
the
students
better
understood
the
causal
relationship
they
were
expected
to
establish
and
support.
This
professor,
who
responded
eagerly
to
my
approaching
him,
is
an
individual
who
truly
appreciates
the
work
done
by
the
writing
associates
assigned
to
his
classes.
By
deducting
points
from
papers
submitted
by
those
students
who
failed
to
meet
with
me,
he
demanded
that
students
respect
the
fact
that
I
was
devoting
time
to
reading
their
papers
and
to
scheduling
conferences.
The
fact
that
he
took
the
care
to
place
my
name
on
the
syllabus
and
the
time
to
introduce
me
to
the
class
further
highlighted
the
importance
of
establishing
and
maintaining
a
positive
working
relationship
with
the
professor
to
whose
class
one
is
assigned.
Influenced
by
the
positive
experience
I
had
with
this
professor,
I
have
already
made
an
effort
to
establish
a
relationship
with
the
professor
with
whom
I
will
be
working
this
fall.
I
wrote
to
him
in
July,
giving
some
information
as
to
my
experiences
as
a
student
and
a
writing
associate
and
explaining
that
I
hoped
to
meet
with
him
the
first
week
classes
are
in
session.
Enrolled
in
only
three
classes
which
required
a
substantial
amount
of
written
work
and
working
as
a
writing
associate
for
a
class
other
than
a
first
year
seminar,
the
second
semester
of
my
junior
year
differed
from
the
previous
term.
Although
after
having
endured
the
most
difficult
semester
of
my
college
career
the
prospect
of
less
writing
relieved
some
anxiety,
the
work
I
was
assigned
in
the
spring
nevertheless
proved
to
be
quite
demanding.
Several
fairly
lengthy
assignments
in
another
three-hundred
level
Spanish
course
challenged
me
to
compose
more
complex
sentences
and
paragraphs
and
to
diminish
my
tendency
to
choose
awkward
phrases
and
words.
In
another
class
which
focused
on
the
philosophy
of
law,
six
separate
take-home
questions
distributed
throughout
the
semester,
three
of
which
comprised
one
full
exam,
required
that
we
reflect
upon
the
views
of
various
philosophers
we
had
read
and
discussed,
that
we
incorporate
any
additional
research
findings
and
that
we
establish
and
explain
our
own
insights.
Unlike
my
fall
philosophy
course,
this
class
did
not
require
that
we
find
a
flaw
in
an
particular
argument;
rather,
we
were
expected
to
compare
and
contrast
several
views
and
to
relate
these
different
views
to
certain
theories
of
law.
Thus,
in
this
class,
I
further
developed
the
ability
to
synthesize
large
quantities
of
material.
Having
learned
a
great
deal
from
the
professor
who
had
provided
the
three
full
pages
of
commentary
on
my
writing,
I
elected
to
take
a
comparative
law
and
politics
class
with
him
in
the
spring.
Not
surprisingly,
it
was
in
this
class
that
I
faced
my
most
difficult
writing
experience
of
the
semester.
Aside
from
requiring
each
student
to
author
a
judicial
opinion
in
a
manner
that
would
be
consistent
with
a
particular
member
of
the
Supreme
Court
and
to
keep
a
journal
detailing
the
entire
research,
decision-making
and
writing
process,
the
professor
assigned
a
term
paper.
We
were
allowed
to
discuss
in
this
paper
virtually
any
topic
pertaining
to
the
law
and
to
research
any
legal
systems.
In
fact,
the
only
requirement
was
that
we
discuss
whatever
aspect
of
the
law
we
chose
in
a
comparative
context;
that
is,
we
were
to
compare
a
particular
law
or
legal
practice
of
one
country
with
that
of
another
country.
Already
interested
in
the
concept
of
gender
equality,
I
chose
to
investigate
how
the
legislatures
and
judicial
bodies
of
various
countries
have
attempted
to
address
the
problem
of
sexual
harassment
in
the
workplace.
After
learning
rather
quickly
that
the
state
of
sexual
harassment
law
in
most
other
countries
is
not
as
advanced
as
it
is
in
the
United
States,
I
realized
that
finding
the
appropriate
cases
would
not
be
as
easy
as
I
had
thought.
Accordingly,
I
decided
to
focus
my
research
on
the
United
States
and
Japan,
rather
than
on
the
United
States
and
some
other
five
countries
as
I
had
originally
planned.
The
professor
had
explained
that
we
had
the
option
of
doing
either
an
empirical
analysis,
which
would
require
that
we
disclose
the
differences
between
the
two
systems
and
explain
the
reasons
for
the
discrepancy,
or
a
normative
analysis,
which
would
require
that
we
explain
which
system
was
preferable.
Possessing
too
little
knowledge
of
Japanese
culture
to
engage
in
an
empirical
analysis,
I
opted
for
the
second
approach.
After
analyzing
the
most
recent
case
law
concerning
sexual
harassment
in
the
United
Sates
and
Japan,
I
concluded
that
the
United
States'
approach
to
the
problem
of
sexual
harassment
was
superior
to
Japan's
and
completed
the
first
draft
accordingly.
Returning
the
draft,
the
professor
explained
rather
swiftly
that
I
had
not
adequately
supported
this
conclusion.
Failing
to
justify
what
I
set
out
to
prove,
I
had
committed
the
same
error
that
I
had
highlighted
in
so
many
of
the
first
year
seminar
papers
I
had
evaluated
the
previous
semester.
Meeting
with
the
professor,
I
learned,
however,
that
I
could
salvage
most
of
the
paper
if
I
took
a
less
extreme
stance
and
if
I
explained
more
precisely
why
the
differences
between
the
two
systems
had
implications
that
were
far-reaching
enough
to
make
one
better
than
the
other.
In
the
spring
semester
I
was
challenged
not
only
as
I
wrote
papers
like
this
Comparative
Law
and
Justice
term
paper
but
also
as
I
served
as
a
writing
associate
for
a
political
theory
class.
Having
taken
the
class,
I
understood
that
many
individuals
leave
this
particular
political
theory
course
wondering
if
they
had
in
fact
even
learned
how
to
write
a
theory
paper
successfully.
Leafing
through
the
five
or
six
page
guideline
entitled
How
to
Write
a
Theory
Paper
which
the
professor
had
provided
to
me
and
all
the
students
enrolled
in
the
class,
I
realized
that
I
would
have
to
focus
in
each
half-an-hour
conference
almost
exclusively
on
higher-order
concerns,
such
as
the
formulation
of
a
theoretical
question
and
the
construction
of
a
corresponding
thesis.
Being
a
writing
associate
who
had
in
the
past
always
attempted
to
tackle
too
much
in
each
conference,
my
experiences
as
a
writing
associate
for
this
course
forced
me
to
not
mention
each
and
every
trouble
spot
I
encountered.
Forced
to
practice
some
restraint,
I
developed
a
strategy
which
allowed
me
at
least
to
make
note
of
a
particular
weakness
without
focusing
extensively
on
it.
Reading
a
paper
before
the
conference,
I
made
a
list
of
all
the
mistakes
which
appeared
repeatedly
throughout
the
paper;
each
time
I
encountered
that
type
of
error,
I
would
write
next
to
it
the
number
which
corresponded
to
my
comments
concerning
that
type
of
mistake.
Utilizing
this
technique,
I
felt
less
uneasy
than
I
would
have
had
I
allowed
these
things
to
go
without
mention.
In
the
school
year
which
is
fast-approaching,
with
law
school
applications
and
a
senior
thesis
looming
ahead
of
me,
my
history
as
a
writer
will
undoubtedly
grow,
as
will
my
experience
as
a
writing
associate.
Finding
that
serving
as
a
writing
associate
has
improved
my
writing
and
that
my
own
writing
experiences
have
assisted
me
as
a
writing
associate,
I
realize
that
the
incoming
writing
associates
have
an
enormous
opportunity
to
develop
both
as
writers
and
as
readers
of
papers.
And,
as
individuals
who
will
come
to
recognize
the
degree
to
which
each
writing
experience
influences
future
writing
endeavors,
these
new
writing
associates
will
most
definitely
come
to
appreciate
that
each
writer
with
whom
they
meet
has
his/her
own
writing
history
and
will
come
to
understand
that
as
writing
associates,
they
are
in
a
position
to
influence
these
histories.
