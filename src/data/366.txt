Narrative
2002
It
really
hit
me
at
the
first
WA
meeting
on
an
early
September
Saturday.
I
thought
to
myself,
"Woah.
People
are
gonna
be
looking
up
to
me
for
advice
on
issues
of
writing
and
composition.
Cool."
It
hadn't
totally
sunk
in
before
that
moment
the
amount
of
respect
and
clout
I
now
held
as
a
writer.
Even
my
friends
who
weren't
one
of
my
students
would
come
to
me
with
questions.
I
also
realized
that
my
new
first-year
students
would
be
looking
to
me
as
a
source
of
information
about
college-level
writing.
Many
of
them
had
experience
as
writers
in
difficult
AP
high
school
classes,
but
none
of
that
can
totally
prepare
a
student
for
his
first
college-level
writing
experience.
I
wanted
to
be
sure
that
I
was
an
effective
advisor
to
my
students
and
that
I
was
able
to
work
with
them,
not
just
talk
at
them,
to
help
them
improve
their
writing.
I
remembered
that
my
WA
from
my
freshman
year
helped
me
to
see
things
about
my
papers
that
I
wouldn't
have
noticed
otherwise.
I
further
explored
points
and
developed
ideas
that
I
never
would
have
in
my
high
school
English
papers
thanks
to
his
suggestions.
I
knew
I
wanted
to
be
as
much
of
an
influence
on
my
students
as
my
WA
was
to
me.
All
of
these
thoughts
at
once
stirred
in
my
mind,
as
they
would
for
anyone
I'm
sure.
Once
the
initial
shock
of
it
all
set
in
and
I
had
a
vision
of
how
I
wanted
things
to
be,
I
began
to
feel
out
my
new
position
as
a
WA
in
my
writing.
The
new
position
I
had
as
a
WA
was
on
the
forefront
of
my
mind
when
I
started
writing
papers
in
the
fall
semester.
I
felt
a
new
pressure
I
hadn't
before.
It
was
as
though
I
believed
that
I
had
to
suddenly
become
a
perfect
writer
without
faults
and
be
knowledgeable
all
the
answers.
The
extreme
prestige
of
the
position
had
managed
to
encroach
on
my
psyche
effecting
how
I
thought
about
my
abilities
as
a
writer
and
my
expectations
of
myself
as
a
writer.
My
first
paper
was
extremely
stressful
as
I
combed
over
every
sentence
and
paragraph,
looking
for
the
slightest
imperfections.
I
also
had
more
people
than
usual
read
and
review
for
me,
so
I
could
get
the
most
outside
opinions
to
improve
it.
Having
a
slight
perfectionist
attitude
towards
my
work,
as
it
is,
things
were
only
escalated
by
the
new
standards
I
held
myself
to
as
a
new
WA.
Thoughts
like,
"What
will
people
think
of
me
if
I
don't
succeed
as
a
writer
now
that
I'm
a
WA?"
and
"Now
I
have
to
write
perfectly
to
live
up
to
this
new
position,"
ran
through
my
mind.
The
stress
I
put
myself
through
was
more
then
I
do
for
other
classes,
and
I
realized
soon
that
I
didn't
have
to.
Over
the
course
of
the
semester
in
talking
with
other
WA's,
with
my
friends,
and
with
my
students
I
learned
that
my
position
as
a
WA
did
not
mean
people
expected
me
to
be
a
perfect
writer.
Being
a
WA
meant
that
I
was
there
to
help
others
explore
and
understand
their
writing:
to
help
them
help
themselves.
Just
because
I
was
qualified
to
help
them,
didn't
mean
I
was
expected
to
be
perfect
myself.
I
had
been
holding
myself
to
an
unreasonable
standard
and
only
putting
extra
pressure
on
myself.
Of
course,
that
doesn't
mean
that
I
let
myself
slack
as
a
writer
or
even
lowered
my
standards.
Being
a
WA
has
helped
me
to
improve
on
my
own
writing
while
having
the
opportunity
to
help
others.
The
stress
I
put
on
myself
at
the
beginning
of
the
semester
was
alleviated
by
my
realization
that
it
was
unreasonable;
the
new
things
I
learned
about
writing
and
myself
helped
to
make
me
myself
a
stronger
and
more
confident
writer.
The
WA
manual,
staff
meetings,
and
discussions
all
gave
me
new
insights
on
things
that
I
hadn't
known,
or
didn't
understand.
Also,
through
my
conferences
I
detected
patterns
of
errors
or
mistakes
that
students
made
and
then
became
more
aware
of
them
in
my
own
writing.
I
was
more
aware
of
what
good,
strong
writing
looked
like
and
what
weak
writing
needed
to
become
stronger.
Being
a
WA
was
a
two-fold
job
for
me.
I
spent
time
helping
and
working
with
my
students;
however,
at
the
same
time
I
was
working
with
myself
to
increase
my
knowledge
and
make
myself
a
stronger
writer.
This
allowed
me
to
provide
the
best
possible
information
and
suggestions
to
my
students.
After
finding
my
place
as
a
writer,
I
found
my
place
as
a
new
WA
through
my
conferences
with
students.
As
a
new
WA
I
was
initially
nervous
to
be
too
forward
or
pushy
with
the
advice
I
gave
in
conferences.
I
wanted
to
help
the
students
as
best
I
could
but
I
was
nervous
at
times
about
giving
incorrect
advice
or
extremely
bad
advice.
I
started
more
conservatively
and
used
the
student
and
professor
feedback
to
gauge
how
I
was
doing.
I
also
at
times
found
listening
and
observing
my
fellow
WA's
gave
me
ideas
or
suggestions
as
to
how
better
advice
my
students.
The
weekly
WA
staff
meetings
and
Conference
at
Muhlenberg
provided
me
with
constant
information
and
inspiration
as
to
how
to
most
effectively
guide
my
students.
I
tried
my
best
to
make
the
conferences
an
open
discussion
between
the
student
and
myself.
One
method
I
found
early
on
to
be
helpful
in
my
conferences
was
drawing
from
personal
experiences
to
relate
to
the
writers.
As
a
sophomore
last
year
I
was
not
far
away
from
where
my
first-year
students
were.
I
understood
where
they
were
coming
from
and
could
relate
to
many
of
the
issues
they
were
being
faced
with.
While
offering
suggestions
to
them
I
would
sometimes
throw
in
my
own
experiences
with
writing,
when
applicable
of
course.
I
tried
to
even
throw
in
things
I'd
done
in
the
past
that
hadn't
worked
out
well.
The
only
thing
I
had
to
remember
when
doing
this
was
to
be
sure
that
the
student
understood
that
I
was
merely
giving
my
experience
and
my
suggestions,
that
in
no
way
was
my
way
the
only
accepted
way.
It
would
go
against
what
I
was
trying
to
help
them
with
if
they
thought
that
I
was
giving
them
the
one
correct
answer.
I
felt
bad
like
I
was
always
providing
a
disclaimer,
but
in
the
end
I
figured
better
to
be
clear
then
to
leave
them
in
confusion!
Unfortunately,
the
student-WA
conference
was
the
first
place
I
felt
I
ran
into
some
difficulty.
As
I
had
learned
and
read
in
the
manual,
the
goal
of
a
conference
was
to
create
a
dialogue
between
the
WA
and
the
student,
that
way
the
student
is
able
to
vocalize
their
ideas
and
further
explore
them.
The
WA
merely
helps
the
student
do
that
and
doesn't
tell
them
what
to
do,
because
that
doesn't
help
either
party.
Unfortunately
I
found
that
often
times
my
students
just
wanted
to
know
what
the
"correct"
answer
was
or
just
wanted
me
to
tell
them
what
I
thought
they
should
do
and
how
to
do
it.
Its
tough
to
hold
your
tongue,
when
an
answer
seems
so
obvious
to
you
but
the
student
just
can't
come
to
the
same
conclusion
on
his
own.
I
found
myself
questioning
whether
I
had
been
clear
enough
about
what
the
job
of
a
WA
was,
whether
I
had
failed
to
clearly
define
my
role
to
the
students,
or
whether
the
students
understood
but
still
just
wanted
an
easy
answer
from
me.
Finally,
I
realized
that
I
had
to
be
sure
that
I
was
keeping
the
conference
on
the
right
track
and
the
students
would
follow
suit.
Just
making
use
of
open-ended
questions
allowed
me
to
encourage
the
students
to
keep
discussing
and
keep
a
conversation
going.
As
long
as
I
kept
things
on
a
more
conversational
level,
my
students
followed
my
lead.
The
second
difficulty
I
had
with
my
conferences
was
attendance.
The
FYS
I
was
paired
with
had
a
looser
policy
when
it
came
to
attending
conferences.
The
professor
made
it
clear
that
they
were
not
required
to
attend,
but
if
they
signed
up
that
they
were
not
to
skip
the
conference.
Initially
this
worked
out
fine,
the
students
would
show
up
if
they
signed
up
and
for
the
most
part
they
all
signed
up.
Knowing
they
had
a
choice
though,
I
found
myself
getting
nervous
after
the
first
set
of
conferences
to
see
how
many
would
sign
up
a
second
time.
In
a
way
I
figured
it
would
be
like
instant
feedback
to
see
whether
they
found
my
advice
worth
coming
back
for.
Luckily,
to
my
delight,
the
same
number
signed
up
for
conferences
the
second
time.
I
was
pleased
to
see
so
many
came
back
and
was
beginning
to
get
to
kno
w
the
students
better.
However,
as
the
end
of
the
semester
rolled
around
and
things
always
get
busy,
the
students
became
distracted.
Unfortunately,
during
the
last
set
of
conferences
several
signed
up
and
never
showed
up
for
various
reasons.
This
was
upsetting
because
I
was
looking
forward
to
working
with
them
again
and
also
because
I
had
to
sit
around
for
two
hours
or
so
while
people
didn't
come.
I
began
to
think
of
ways
to
deal
with
the
issue
but
at
that
point
it
was
too
late,
because
there
were
no
conferences
left
in
the
semester.
Looking
on
the
bright
side
of
the
situation
though,
if
I
ever
am
presented
with
a
similar
situation
in
the
future
I
already
have
experience
with
it
and
have
ideas
of
how
to
solve
the
problem.
During
the
second
semester
of
the
past
year
I
did
not
serve
as
an
active
WA
and
was
able
to
focus
on
my
own
writing.
I
found
myself
using
much
of
what
I
had
learned
the
semester
before
and
feeling
like
a
much
stronger
writer.
I
had
paid
attention
to
the
patterns
of
error
and
the
positive
trends
from
my
students
and
then
used
it
to
my
advantage
as
a
writer.
I
was
able
to
draw
on
my
resources
as
a
WA
(notes,
books,
Drop-in)
to
keep
my
writing
at
a
strong
level.
One
development
that
I
hadn't
expected
during
my
"off-semester"
was
becoming
an
unofficial-WA
for
my
building.
It
was
early
in
the
second
semester
when
there
was
a
knock
on
my
door.
It
was
a
girl
from
my
floor
who
said
she
heard
I
was
a
WA
and
if
I
didn't
mind
reading
her
paper.
So
I
read
it
and
gave
her
a
quick
mini-conference
with
some
suggestions.
I
later
found
out
that
she
was
on
a
sports
team
with
one
of
my
first
semester
students
who
had
told
her
about
me.
I
took
it
as
a
compliment
that
the
word
got
around
and
someone
sought
me
out.
A
few
of
my
other
friends
would
often
come
to
me
with
papers
asking
for
advice
as
well.
It
was
a
rather
empowering
feeling
that
people
would
come
to
me
as
a
friend
and
a
WA
for
advice.
This
also
helped
me
to
maintain
my
WA
skills
and
feel
more
confident
as
a
writer,
because
if
people
tell
you
something
enough,
you
start
to
believe
it.
And
people
were
telling
me
that
I
was
a
strong,
knowledgeable
writer
who
was
effective
as
an
advice
giver.
Looking
at
my
personal
narrative
from
last
summer,
which
detailed
my
life
as
a
writer
so
far
and
looking
at
how
I
am
writing
about
myself
now
makes
me
realize
how
much
I've
changed.
I've
learned
so
much
in
terms
of
information,
techniques
for
conferences,
and
even
grammar.
I've
come
such
a
long
was
from
my
days
of
high
school
where
I
thought
I
was
a
mediocre
writer
with
little
to
offer
my
peers.
I've
become
more
self-assured,
confident
in
my
abilities,
and
knowledge
leaving
me
feeling
much
more
secure
in
my
WA
position.
By
the
end
of
the
first
semester
I
felt
like
my
conferences
had
become
smoother,
I'd
built
a
rapport
with
my
students,
and
I
was
able
to
adapt
our
conversation
and
my
suggestions
to
their
needs.
I
think
that
everyone
needs
to
go
through
the
process
of
finding
his
or
her
niche
as
a
WA.
The
first
year
for
me
served
as
not
only
a
growing
experience
but
also
a
settling
experience.
I
learned
so
much
and
felt
like
I
was
growing,
but
I
also
felt
like
I
was
relaxing
into
the
position,
loosening
the
stress-level
I
had
myself
under.
I
finished
my
first
year
with
a
good
amount
of
experiences,
both
positive
and
negative,
that
I
will
be
able
to
draw
on
in
my
conferences
for
next
year.
Last
summer
as
I
was
anticipating
starting
my
career
as
a
WA,
I
felt
so
honored
that
I
had
been
chosen
to
join
the
ranks
of
the
prestigious
group
of
students
that
I
looked
up
to
for
advice
and
leadership
in
writing.
Initially
when
I
took
my
post
I
became
overwhelmed
by
the
expectations
I
held
for
myself
based
on
the
reputation
of
the
program.
However,
through
my
good
and
bad
experiences
of
the
first
year
I
learned
"the
ropes"
and
I
also
found
my
own
place
a
writer,
reaching
a
new
plateau
in
my
career.
I
moved
from
a
beginner
at
the
college
level
of
writing
to
a
stronger,
more
confident
confident,
knowledgeable,
and
informed
writer
who
feels
that
she
has
been
equipped
with
the
correct
tools
to
continue
helping
others
and
herself.
