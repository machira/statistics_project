WRITING
NARRATIVE
The
earliest
memories
are
the
clearest.
The
dark
comer
of
the
last
drawer
in
my
closet
contains
a
pile
of
worn
and
dusty
books
of
varying
sizes.
These
are
the
diaries.
My
childhood
dreams
and
desires
are
stacked
in
these
beaten
notebooks
in
no
particular
order.
I
can
remember
sitting
down
every
night
before
I
went
to
sleep
and
attempting
to
recapture
my
day.
Endless
days
when
I
was
young
when
the
only
things
I
worried
about
were
who
I
would
play
with
at
recess
and
whether
or
not
I
should
invite
somebody
who
I
can't
even
remember
to
my
birthday
party.
Seemed
so
important
then,
but
now
her
name
is
lost
somewhere
in
that
closet.
This
is
how
I
began
to
write.
The
childish
diaries
grew
into
adult
journals,
but
the
point
was
always
the
same.
I
wanted
so
badly
to
record
everything,
to
remember
even
the
most
insignificant
detail
of
my
life.
Needless
to
say
there
is
much
that
I
have
forgotten,
and
memories
that
there
was
never
enough
time
to
write
down.
This
is
not
to
belittle
what
remains.
The
childish
scrawl
became
my
own
personal
writing
as
the
years
passed,
and
I
became
the
woman
that
I
see
in
the
mirror.
The
diaries
are
like
the
child
I
see
hidden
deep
within
the
woman's
eyes.
Although
I
continue
to
write
for
myself
in
notebooks
that
I
so
maturely
call
journals,
I
began
to
notice
that
I
had
a
talent
for
writing
in
all
different
mediums.
The
personal
writing
will
always
be
the
most
sacred
because
it
is
always
for
and
of
me.
The
lines
that
I
write
late
at
night
are
the
stuff
and
nonsense
of
which
I
am
made.
They
are
similar
to
the
letters
that
I
write
to
those
I
love
who
are
far
away.
My
father
receives
many
of
these
letters
that
sound
so
much
as
if
I
am
talking
directly
to
him.
My
grandmother
used
to
tell
me
that
my
letters
made
her
smile
because
she
felt
as
though
I
was
sitting
right
next
to
her
telling
her
a
story.
At
the
time
I
was
too
young
to
understand
the
happiness
that
I
had
given
her.
Looking
back
now,
I
laugh
at
the
things
I
must
have
written
and
am
glad
that
my
thoughts
gave
someone
else
so
much
pleasure.
Academically,
the
most
poignant
memory
I
have
about
a
writing
experience
occurred
when
I
was
in
fifth
grade.
I'm
not
sure
if
this
memory
stands
out
in
my
mind
the
most
because
it
was
the
first
time
someone
told
me
I
had
a
gift
or
because
Mrs.
Loizeaux
made
me
read
my
poem
in
front
of
the
class.
I
have
a
great
fear
of
public
speaking.
Perhaps
the
word
fear
is
not
strong
enough.
Let's
call
it
paranoia.
Anyway,
I
can
remember
the
opening
lines
to
this
poem
that
I
still
have
somewhere.
It
was
about
a
dolphin
who
"leaped
and
dove
in
the
deep
blue
mist,"
and
I
had
scattered
a
few
words
on
each
line
the
way
I
thought
true
poetry
should
be
written.
After
the
dolphin
the
memories
are
shrouded
in
shadows
that
I
have
created
from
the
unhappiness
that
I
felt
as
a
student
at
Rye
Country
Day
School.
I
suppose
that
if
I
try
hard
enough
I
could
remember
essays
that
I
wrote
and
book
reports
that
I
painstakingly
researched,
but
those
years
are
painful
to
remember.
The
diaries
tell
more
about
those
depressing
years
than
some
assignment
ever
could.
The
day
of
my
Eighth
grade
graduation
was
perhaps
the
second
time
that
someone
recognized
that
I
had
a
talent
for
writing.
I
was
given
the
English
award
at
graduation
because
my
teacher
had
been
so
impressed
that
I
attempted
to
read
Wuthering
Heights.
I
never
quite
understood
how
she
could
give
me
the
award
as
I
never
managed
to
finish
the
story.
In
fact,
I'm
not
sure
if
I
ever
finished
writing
that
book
report.
I
think
that
it
was
due
largely
to
my
receiving
the
English
award
that
I
was
placed
in
the
advanced
English
program
in
high
school.
The
papers
that
I
wrote
in
ninth
and
tenth
grade
do
not
stand
out
in
my
memory
because
they
were
all
assigned
topics
that
restricted
my
creativity.
It
was
not
until
I
entered
AP
English
in
11th
grade
that
I
was
finally
able
to
choose
my
subject
matter.
Being
a
sixteen
year
old
fascinated
with
romance,
I
chose
to
write
about
James
Dean.
I
think
I
called
my
paper,
"Rebel
With
a
Cause."
At
the
time
I
thought
that
was
a
pretty
catchy
title.
Anyway
this
was
the
paper
that
taught
me
how
to
research,
something
that
I
strangely
enough
enjoy
doing.
The
strategies
that
I
employed
then
are
the
ones
that
I
still
use
today.
I
still
go
to
the
library
and
check
every
book
that
I
can
carry
out
with
me.
The
thought
of
having
to
do
research
in
a
library
makes
me
miserable.
I
love
to
curl
up
on
my
bed,
knowing
that
I
can
stay
here
for
as
long
as
I
want.
It's
important
that
I
decide
when
I
am
going
to
work
as
opposed
to
hours
of
operation
being
my
deciding
factor.
Once
I've
checked
out
all
of
my
books,
I
stack
them
in
a
big
pile
around
me
and
get
out
a
college
ruled
notepad
and
a
black
pen.
I
always
use
a
black
pen
and
only
a
black
pen.
I'm
convinced
that
I
keep
the
Farinon
bookstore
in
business
since
I
have
developed
quite
a
talent
for
losing
all
fifty
of
my
pens.
I
copy
every
important
fact
that
I
find
in
these
books
onto
these
pages.
If
I
need
a
footnote
I
place
the
page
number
in
the
left
hand
margin
of
the
paper.
Each
book
has
its
own
set
of
pages
and
the
bibliography
heads
each
grouping
of
pages.
Once
I
have
copied
all
of
my
notes,
I
return
to
the
pages
and
mark
the
spot
where
my
paper
will
begin.
I
then
proceed
to
begin
typing
my
paper,
crossing
out
each
fact
as
I
use
it.
This
is
how
I
achieve
my
rough
draft
which
I
will
then
print
out
and
edit.
Editing
must
always
be
done
in
a
red
pen.
Obviously
a
throwback
to
my
high
school
years.
The
red
pen
is
used
to
tear
my
paper
to
pieces,
and
then
I
return
to
the
computer
to
begin
making
all
of
the
changes.
My
final
draft
is
always
remarkably
different
from
my
rough
draft.
I
decided
to
take
AP
English
again
in
12th
grade
because
the
curriculum
was
different,
but
I
did
not
have
to
retake
the
AP
exam
as
I
had
already
scored
a
4.
So
I
decided
I
would
do
something
a
little
different
for
my
final
report.
My
topic
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
that
I
have
yet
to
research.
I
wrote
about
Alice
in
Wonderland
as
a
manifestation
of
the
phallic
symbol.
Lots
of
interesting
theories
about
this
topic!
Then
it
was
time
for
college
applications
to
be
written.
And
I
used
to
think
that
high
school
stunted
your
creativity.
Nothing
has
ever
made
me
as
miserable
as
trying
to
write
in
the
most
intelligent
way
possible
who
was
the
most
important
person
in
my
life.
I
mean,
how
interesting
can
an
essay
like
that
be.
Needless
to
say
my
essay
got
me
accepted
to
Lafayette
where
I
would
truly
learn
that
I
not
only
had
a
gift
for
writing,
but
I
also
enjoyed
doing
it.
I
bypassed
the
Freshman
seminar
program
at
Lafayette
and
headed
directly
into
English
105.
I
believe
this
course
is
now
referred
to
as
English
205.
Suffice
to
say
that
this
course
was
tough.
The
professor
was
demanding
to
say
the
least,
but
she
was
also
extremely
insightful
and
supportive.
She
was
the
one
who
taught
me
how
to
write
and
rewrite
because
God
forbid
the
final
draft
that
you
submitted
look
anything
like
your
rough
draft!
This
course
was
different
than
any
I
had
taken
in
high
school
because
this
professor
was
not
afraid
to
let
me
know
when
I
was
slacking.
She
helped
to
develop
abilities
within
me
that
I
didn't
even
know
that
I
had.
More
than
that,
this
professor
became
a
woman
that
I
could
call
a
friend.
She
is
still
someone
who
I
go
to
for
advice
even
though
I
have
never
again
had
her
as
a
professor.
The
survey
classes
bored
me.
In
fact,
these
classes
were
definitely
more
tedious
for
me
than
most
others
because
I
was
under
the
impression
that
I
was
supposed
to
take
all
four
of
them.
These
are
the
worst
types
of
misunderstandings!
During
Interim
session
of
my
sophomore
year,
I
traveled
to
London
with
seven
other
students
to
take
London
Theater.
Here,
I
dealt
with
demanding
and
exacting
professors
who
pushed
and
pushed
you
to
give
the
best.
In
all
honesty
they
gave
as
much
as,
if
not
more
than,
they
required.
Writing
in
this
medium
was
new
to
me.
Not
only
did
I
have
to
discuss
the
plays
which
I
had
seen,
I
had
to
incorporate
how
the
action
and
psychology
of
the
characters
and
plot
had
been
realized
upon
the
stage.
All
papers
were
to
be
hand
written,
but
overcoming
this,
I
somehow
managed
to
write
one
of
my
best
papers
ever
about
the
play
Machinal.
I
remember
struggling
off
the
train
at
Canterbury
with
all
of
my
luggage
and
having
my
professor
hail
me
over
to
him.
He
really
does
hail
people!!
Of
course
I
thought
that
I
must
be
in
some
kind
of
trouble,
but
he
only
wanted
to
congratulate
me
on
my
paper,
telling
me
that
it
was
one
of
the
best
he
had
ever
read.
I
think
I
really
disappointed
him
when
I
submitted
my
second
paper.
I
just
couldn't
get
as
involved
with
the
subject
matter,
something
that
I
think
is
the
deciding
factor
between
good
and
great.
The
summer
before
my
junior
year,
I
decided
that
I
should
pursue
some
kind
of
internship
in
order
to
determine
what
kind
of
career
I
wanted
to
go
into
after
graduation.
I
managed
to
get
a
two
month
internship
with
a
new
newspaper
in
Brooklyn
called
Brooklyn
Woman.
Did
I
mention
that
this
was
a
completely
unpaid
internship
which
involved
me
having
to
commute
for
a
total
of
three
hours
a
day.
Yes,
this
is
the
equivalent
of
me
traveling
to
and
from
Lafayette
every
day.
Despite
all
of
these
minuses,
I
managed
to
make
the
most
of
this
job.
I
did
everything
and
anything.
I
edited
for
hours
in
the
morning,
interviewed
nasty
people
in
the
afternoon,
attended
Planned
Parenthood
Conferences,
and
managed
to
see
four
of
my
articles
in
print
in
three
of
the
newspapers.
My
name
was
also
listed
on
the
TOC
page
under
Editorial
Assistant.
Did
I
mention
that
this
was
an
extremely
small
staffed
paper?
I
have
to
admit
that
it
was
a
big
thrill
to
see
my
name
in
print
and
know
that
those
were
my
articles
that
people
were
reading.
However,
despite
the
glory,
I
also
had
to
admit
to
myself
that
there
was
no
way
that
I
could
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
doing
this.
I
hated
it
with
a
passion
because
I
felt
that
I
couldn't
really
write
the
way
that
I
wanted
to
write.
Everything
had
to
be
executed
on
an
elementary
level
and,
as
a
result,
much
of
the
challenge
was
lost.
That
summer
I
learned
what
I
didn't
want
to
do
with
my
life.
My
junior
year
at
Lafayette
would
show
me
what
I
did
want
out
of
life.
I
had
decided
to
double
major
in
English
and
Art
History
at
the
end
of
my
sophomore
year,
and
I
had
developed
a
great
love
for
al
kinds
of
Art.
I
chose
to
write
an
extensive
paper
on
the
life
of
Nicholas
Poussin,
and
it
was
in
this
paper
that
I
realized
the
love
I
had
for
critiquing
and
interpreting
works
of
art.
Although
I
have
no
artistic
talent
myself,
I
loved
the
way
that
I
could
bring
a
painting
to
life
through
the
written
word.
Showing
others
the
depth,
movement,
and
psychology
of
a
work
in
relationship
to
its
political,
cultural,
historical,
and
social
structures
was
not
only
challenging
but
also
interesting.
More
than
this,
it
was
enjoyable.
At
the
end
of
my
junior
year,
I
was
recommended
to
write
an
honors
thesis
for
and
by
the
English
department.
I
was
honored
because
the
professor
that
asked
me
if
I
was
interested
in
working
on
an
honors
thesis
was
the
professor
that
I
most
revere
at
Lafayette.
However,
I
had
to
decline
this
privilege
because
I
knew
there
was
something
else
that
I
would
rather
do.
I
proceeded
to
the
William's
Center
where
I
was
immediately
approved
for
an
honors
thesis
in
Art.
The
topic
of
my
thesis
was
inevitable.
I
knew
I
had
to
write
about
Renoir,
the
artist
who
makes
my
spirit
soar.
In
essence
I
have
always
written
whether
it
was
for
myself
or
for
others,
but
it
is
only
now
that
I
know
what
I
want
to
write.
Lafayette
showed
me
how
to
push
myself
to
new
heights
in
creativity
and
style,
but
it
was
my
heart
that
showed
me
where
to
channel
this
talent.
