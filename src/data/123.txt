Comprehensive
Writing
Program
The.
Toolbox
Art
is
a
thread
throughout
my
writing
history.
Ever
since
I
can
remember,
I
have
been
drawing
pictures
and
designs.
Even
nowadays,
I
pencil
still-life
drawings
and
water
paint
scenery.
However,
most-times
I
paint
or
draw
creations
of
my
imagination.
These
inventions
began
as
disproportionate
amateur
scribbles,
then
slowly
progressed
to
more
defined,
real,
and
distinct
figures.
The
designs
especially,
look
as
intricate
as
my
thoughts,
yet
as
simple
as
the
tools
I
use
to
create
them.
All
my
thoughts,
composed
of
sounds
I
have
heard,
images
I
have
seen,
and
texts
I
have
read,
are
captive
inside
my
mind,
arranged
into
compartments.
This
organizing
is
similar
to
an
artist
and
his
or
her
toolbox.
Inside
the
toolbox
the
artist
keeps
utensils
such
as
brushes,
paints,
pencils,
erasers,
scissors,
palates
and
highlighters.
Sometimes
the
box
comes
with
the
tools,
and
sometimes
it
does
not.
I
have
decided
that
my
history
as
a
writer
is
like
the
history
of
an
artist,
and
so
merits
the
composition
of
a
toolbox
of
it
s
own.
There
are
many
tools
I
have
acquired
over
the
years.
My
first
tools
were
those
of
communication.
I
remember
learning
the
alphabet
in
Kindergarten,
with
the
help
of
Ernie
the
Elephant
who
taught
the
whole
class
the
letter11E."
Roger
the
Raccoon
showed
us
that
ring,
nin,
and
rail
are
all
related.
I
remember
sitting
on
what
now
would
be
a
tiny
chair,
at
a
round
blue
table,
creating
my
own
book.
Pictures
of
people
and
the
sun
and
cars
drawn
with
red,
yellow,
green,
and
even
gold
Crayon
stubs
populated
each
of
the
ten
pictures
in
the
booklet.
Each
page
composed
part
of
a
story.
A
story
that
I
later
enthusiastically
shared
with
my
teacher.
She
wrote
it
down
for
me
on
the
penciled-in
lines
on
the
respective
pages.
This
way,
the
limited
amount
of
tools
in
my
developing
toolbox
did
not
inhibit
my
imagination.
At
home,
the
toolbox
grew
even
more.
My
mom
tells
me
that
I
was
dying
to
write
out
what
I
was
thinking.
She
says
I
constantly
asked
her
how
to
spell
words
like
silly1
and
the1
and
tablecloth.
I
would
ask
so
many
questions
that
my
mom
finally
stopped
what
she
was
doing
to
write
down
what
I
wanted
to
say.
I
then
copied
the
words,
concentrating
on
spelling
and
the
shape
of
the
letters.
Once
I
was
able
to
write,
I
practiced
all
the
time.
Most
of
what
I
wrote
was
nonsense.
I
wrote
with
my
left
hand,
and
then
my
right
hand,
determined
to
make
the
letters
look
the
same
no
matter
which
hand
I
used.
I
employed
techniques
that
my
dad
taught
me.
He
told
me
to
Move
the
whole
wrist
as
well
as
the
hand.
Don't
just
use
the
fingers.
My
dad
wanted
a
continuous
and
smooth
flow.
I
also
learned
to
hold
my
hand
below
the
line
where
I
was
writing
so
as
not
to
smear
the
newly
written
letters
across
the
page.
All
the
practice
showed
in
my
work
at
school.
Often
I
would
receive
little
hand-written
stars
for
an
exceptional
looking
o
or
m
in
various
handwriting
exercises.
By
third
grade
the
stars
were
harder
to
come
by.
I
learned
the
difficulties
of
research,
as
well
as
producing
written
reports
including
title
pages,
illustrations,
body
content,
and
bibliographies.
I
am
still
proud
of
my
Frog
report.
The
detail
that
was
put
into
drawing
the
green
frog
on
the
cover
page
--
big
bright
cartoon
eyes,
huge
puffy
cheeks,
with
a
long
red
tongue
sticking
out
of
a
smiling
mouth,
and
squatting
down
ready
to
pounce
--
was
equivalent
to
the
effort
put
into
the
report.
Not
only
did
I
explain
the
habitat
of
the
various
tree
frogs
and
water
frogs,
I
also
described
growth,
eating,
and
mating
mannerisms.
I
even
included
an
article
on
the
two
largest
frogs
found
in
Australia.
This
report
also
happened
to
be
the
first
one
that
I
typed
out
on
the
computer
by
myself
--
no
help
from
Mom.
The
computer
was
slow,
yet
once
I
learned
how
to
type,
editing
and
rewriting
took
shorter
periods
of
time
and
became
more
fun.
Just
as
the
computer
was
a
new
asset
to
my
toolbox,
so
were
the
teachings
of
Mrs.
Hartwig,
a
joyful,
knowledgeable,
but
somewhat
nervous
woman,
who
helped
to
sharpen
the
tools
I
had
thus-far
added
to
my
toolbox.
Through
her,
the
class
explored
the
English
language.
Workshops
allowed
us
to
successfully
compose
a
paragraph
without
using
the
same
word
more
than
once
to
start
a
sentence.
She
also
had
us
learn
the
differences
between
comma
splices
and
run-on
sentences.
We
discovered
how
much
more
diverse
and
captivating
an
event
sounded
using
such
techniques.
Mrs.
Hartwig
had
us
study
The
Hobbit.
our
first
big
text.
She
also
exposed
^various
types
and
styles
of
poems,
like
rhyme,
prose,
and
Haiku.
That
year
was
also
the
year
the
Young
Author's
Festival
took
place
in
Vienna,
Austria.
Each
year,
approximately
200
Middle*5chool
students
from
International
Schools
in
Europe
gathered
in
one
of
the
schools.
For
a
week,
students
attended
workshops,
performed
skits,
and
met
with
authors
like
Richard
Peck
and
Richard
Scary.
Mrs.
Hartwig
took
the
opportunity
to
open
our
minds
to
ideas
and
processes
behind
composing,
editing,
illustrating,
and
publishing
a
book.
Then
she
encouraged
us
to
create
our
own
mini-novel.
I
still
refer
to
that
year
as
an
important
one
in
discovering
how
to
use
the
pens
and
pencils
and
paints
to
find
my
own
style
of
writing.
This
exposure
allowed
me
to
craft
other
types
of
writing.
In
eighth
grade
I
ran
for
president
of
the
class.
As
I
wrote
my
speech,
I
thought
of
how
different
it
had
to
sound
from
the
mini-novel
I
wrote
for
Mrs.
Hartwig's
English
class.
That
novel
was
for
myself.
I
did
not
have
to
read
it
to
anyone;
much
less
show
it
to
anyone.
The
speech,
on
the
other
hand,
I
had
to
memorize
and
deliver
to
the
entire
eighth
grade.
I
wondered
how
I
could
produce
something
that
did
not
sound
boring
or
exactly
like
the
speeches
of
my
opponents.
My
ten
years
at
the
school,
my
friendships
with
my
classmates
and
the
teachers,
as
well
as
my
care
to
listen
and
help,
qualified
me
for
the
job
...
once
I
got
it.
My
problem
was,
how
I
could
let
the
class
know
that
I
was
their
leader.
I
had
to
show
them
that
they
could,
and
already
did,
follow
me.
When
it
was
finally
my
turn
to
talk,everyone
seemed
to
forget
the
quiver
in
my
voice
as
I
delivered
my
speech.
not
only
did
they
like
my
propositions,
they
admired
what
I
achieved.
I
requested
everyone's
participation
as
I
asked
them
to
Stand
up...turn
around...put
your
right
hand
on
your
head...now
your
left
hand
on
your
nose.
I
concluded
with,
See,
I
have
just
demonstrated
my
leadership
ability,
and
your
willingness
to
follow
me....
At
around
the
same
time
that
I
began
choosing
which
tools
to
use,
I
became
involved
in
the
Science
Fairs.
Excitement
with
the
research
and
resulting
discoveries,
highlighted
my
curiosity
and
interest
in
science.
Looking
back,
each
year
I
participated,
I
chose
subjects
concentrating
in
the
Human
Health
and
Behavior
category.
My
sixth
grade
report
described
how
I
built
a
device
out
of
pipes
and
a
balloon
pump
to
discover
the
effect
of
tar
and
cigarette
smoke
on
the
lungs.
I
used
various
brands
of
cigarettes,
which
I
received
from
teachers
after
posting
a
note
in
the
weekly
announcements
at
school.
Once
I
placed
the
cigarette
and
a
piece
of
Kleenex
tissue
in
their
respective
places
in
the
device,
I
used
the
balloon
pump
to
'inhale'
on
the
cigarette
twenty
times.
In
my
report,
I
also
described
the
methods
I
used
to
find
the
difference
in
light
transmittance
through
the
tissue
before
and
after
the
cigarette
was
smoked.
To
do
this,
I
operated
equipment
in
my
dad's
photography
darkroom.
Results
depicted
each
of
the
wet-sand-colored
spots
on
the
tissue
pieces,
and
concluded
with
all
cigarettes
being
harmful.
Although
Marlboro
leads
the
cigarettes
I
received
as
being
the
"least
transmitting,"
the
Light
brands
were
not
necessarily
much
better.
Involvement
in
the
Science
Fairs
arose
my
interest
in
the
field;
an
interest
that
carried
through
High
school
and
into
college.
Going
through
the
years
of
composing
my
toolbox,
I
have
come
across
times
when
I
have
acquired
a
tool,
or
a
means
to
use
the
tool,
but
I
have
not
used
it
until
much
later.
Like
an
artist,
who
finds
a
new
watercolor
marker
hiding
under
the
jumble
of
oil
paints,
during
my
first
years
of
High
school,
I
realized
that
I
could
write
about
certain
events.
Previously,
I
figured
that
perhaps
my
life
was
just
uneventful
and
that
I
did
not
have
the
funny
and
heart-throbbing
occurrences
my
classmates
did.
Once
I
understood
that
I
did,
I
found
fun
in
comparing
a
first
kiss
to
a
ride
on
a
roller
coaster,
or
a
sudden
splash
of
cold
water,
or
a
sweet
hard
candy.
I
learned
that
I
had
tons
to
say
about
a
single
blade
of
grass.
With
a
little
of
the
imagination
I
had
in
Elementary
school,
my
reflections
seemed
more
real.
Metaphors
and
similies
are
not
childish.
They
are
a
natural
means
of
communication
and
understanding.
All
these
things
I
experimented
with
in
my
descriptive
essays,
in
my
poems,
in
my
class
journal,
and
even
in
my
personal
diary.
Going
into
my
junior
year
of
high
school,
everyone
--
my
teachers,
parents,
and
college
friends
-
told
me
I
was
preparing
for
College
writing.
The
classes
would
expose
me
to
analytical,
research,
lab,
and
descriptive
work.
It
was
the
first
time
my
schedule
consisted
only
of
International
Baccalaureate
(IB)
courses,
and
I
was
balancing
French,
Chemistry,
Biology,
German,
and
Art,
along
with
Student
Council
and
my
three
favorite
Varsity
sports.
Determined
to
show
how
much
I
liked
to
illustrate,
I
was
ready
to
use
pictures
or
just
descriptions
of
thoughts
in
my
imagination.
However,
the
year
with
Mrs.
Sellars,
my
junior
year
English
teacher,
shattered
some
of
my
confidence
in
my
writing
ability.
I
had
a
hard
time
believing
that
I
could
write
a
convincing
thesis.
I
did
not
think
my
grades
in
that
class
reflected
the
effort
I
put
into
my
work.
At
one
point
I
half
tried
putting
less
work
into
one
of
my
essays,
only
to
realize
no
difference
in
her
comments,
nor
the
letter-grade.
Known
for
her
reputation
of
assigning
a
grade
to
her
students'
first
paper,
and
then
keeping
that
grade
throughout
the
year,
I
wanted
to
change
that.
However,
it
did
not
matter
how
hard
I
worked,
or
how
imaginative,
or
insightful
I
thought
I
was.
The
first
book
the
class
read,
Mikhail
Dostoyevski's
Crime
and
Punishment,
introduced
us
to
symbolism
and
imagery
in
a
depth
in
which
most
of
us
were
not
prepared.
I
found
it
outrageously
foreign
and
yet
fascinating,
that
a
color
such
as
yellowed
white,
meant
dirtiness
and
poor
living
conditions,
as
well
as
was
a
symbol
for
prostitution.
Mrs.
Sellars
often
repeated,
You
are
allowed
to
say
anything
you
want
about
imagery
and
symbolism
in
the
books
we
read,
as
long
as
you
can
support
what
you
say
with
quotations.
Yet,
every
time
I
tried,
she
did
not
like
what
I
had
to
say.
Maybe
I
did
not
understand
what
she
was
looking
for.
Maybe
Mrs.
Sellars
did
not
understand
what
I
was
saying.
During
a
personal
conference
with
her,
we
both
ended
up
frustrated.
I
knew
how
to
orally
express
my
ideas,
but
because
I
had
so
many
of
them,
I
needed
help
concentrating
on
one.
Mrs.
Sellars
did
not
know
how
to
help
me.
The
comments
she
made
were,
You
don't
have
a
thesis,
or,
It
doesn't
make
sense.
I
knew
that
much.
Looking
back,
both
the
symbolism
and
the
diverse
issues
involved
in
the
literature
overwhelmed
me.
In
Mahfouz's
The
Journey
of
Ibn
Fattouma.
and
Beckett's
Waiting
for
Godot,
the
contrast
of
the
importance
between
living
for
the
afterlife
and
for
the
present
had
me
double
guessing
everything.
I
could
not
write
because
I
was
not
sure
which
position
I
held.
What
made
things
more
confusing,
was
that
where
English
and
Mrs.
Sellars
proved
to
be
so
tough,
French
and
Mme.
Norris
went
so
well.
I
used
the
ideas
I
formed
in
my
English
classes
to
write
in
French.
For
some
reason,
I
found
structure
in
a
foreign
language.
Possibly
this
was
a
result
of
a
more
limited
vocabulary.
I
don't
think
so.
Mme.
Norris
gave
me
some
advice
that
I
have
since
used
in
English,
as
well
as
German,
Chemistry
and
Biology.
She
told
me
to
Be
simple.
Say
what
you
want
to
as
concise
as
you
can.
It
works.
The
sentences
may
sound
simple,
and
may
take
more
work
to
construct,
but
they
are
not
necessarily
short.
After
a
frustrating
junior
year,
I
organized
all
my
tools.
I
found
a
place
for
each
one,
making
notes
as
to
which
tools
are
for
coloring,
for
defining,
for
shading,
and
for
highlighting.
I
also
made
a
note
as
to
which
material,
or
sound-board
to
use
for
various
masterpieces.
My
IB
Higher
Level
Chemistry
professor,
Mr.
Rolfe,
was
an
excellent
example
of
someone
who
knew
how
to
use
tools.
The
information
he
shared
with
his
students
was
thorough
yet
not
excessive.
The
way
Mr.
Rolfe
taught
the
chemistry
benefited
each
of
his
students.
His
methods
included
lecture
along
with
drawing
diagrams
with
black,
blue,
green,
and
red
colored
pens
on
an
overhead
projector.
If
questions
arose,
Mr.
Rolfe
answered
them
according
to
the
particular
student's
learning
preference
--
whether
it
be
in
a
visual,
or
oral,
or
written
form.
In
my
senior
year,
things
with
Mrs.
Zlabinger
went
really
well.
Mrs.
Zlabinger
was
the
master
of
metaphors
and
similes.
Mrs.
Zlabinger
had
a
biting
wit
and
very
dry
sense
of
humor.
She
was
Queen
of
The
Little
English
Handbook,
and
yet
understood
that
not
everyone
was
as
enamored
and
crafty
with
the
English
language
as
she
was.
Often
referred
to
by
the
students
as
The
Zlab,
she
was
a
teacher
who
inspired
her
students
to
write.
I
enjoyed
the
assignments.
Writing
essays
in
the
style
that
Jorge
Luis
Borges
wrote
Borges
and
I,
and
reading
William
Faulkner's
The
Sound
and
the
Fury.
highlighted
my
interest
in
literature.
The
author's
writing
showed
how
style
influences
the
reaction
of
the
readers
and
how
much
they
understand
at
a
particular
point
in
the
piece.
Among
some
other
works
we
studied,
Franz
Kafka's
The
Metamorphosis
opened
my
thoughts
to
imagine
myself
as
Gregor
Samsa,
alone
and
shut
off
from
society,
yet
still
full
of
feelings
and
character.
I
still
remember
the
white
walls,
and
how
hurt
I
would
be
if
my
sister
treated
me
as
Gregor's
did.
What
I
appreciated
most
about
Mrs.
Zlabinger,
were
the
comments
on
my
papers.
Mrs.
Zlabinger
wrote
"good"
in
specific
places
throughout
the
essays,
either
for
insight,
grammar,
or
structure.
When
I
compared
the
"good"
sentences
with
the
"unclear"
ones,
I
discovered
what
was,
and
what
wasn't
acceptable.
Reading
through
my
work,
I
honestly
agreed
with
what
she
said.
This
allowed
me
to
create
a
soundboard,
or
a
palate,
from
which
to
paint
illustrations
or
build
structure.
College
was
the
test
for
me.
After
thinking
over
each
of
the
tools
I
had
acquired,
how
to
use
them,
when
to
use
them,
and
how
often
to
use
them,
I
wanted
to
see
if
I
was
right.
After
analyzing
the
tools,
I
discovered
that
they
weren't
necessarily
confined
to
the
compartments
and
structures
I
had
originally
placed
them
in.
It
pleased
me
to
find
this
out,
not
only
through
my
First
Year
Seminar
class,
but
also
through
my
Biology
and
French
classes.
I
learned
that
mixing
writing
tools
and
styles
is
acceptable,
just
like
combining
various
art
media,
to
produce
a
more
defined
and
sharper-looking
piece
of
work.
In
writing,
underlining
analytical
ideas
with
personal
insights,
enhancing
writing
with
illustrations,
and
listening
as
well
as
speaking,
increase
knowledge
in
the
tools
of
communication.
I
had
already
experimented
with
different
art
media,
using
tools
from
my
art
box.
Now
my
toolboxes
are
interchangeable,
and
the
thread
throughout
my
artwork
is
also
the
thread
throughout
my
writing.
