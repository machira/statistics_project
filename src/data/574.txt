Literacy
Assignment:
My
History
as
a
Writer
I
did
not
realize
how
difficult
it
is
to
catalogue
the
major
experiences
that
define
my
career
as
a
writer;
part
of
this
difficulty
stems
from
the
fact
that
I
rarely
examine
the
two
spheres
into
which
I
divide
my
writing
simultaneously.
There
is
the
racademic
sphere,s
writing
that
I
am
obliged
to
do
for
my
teachers
and
peers,
and
there
is
the
rpersonal
sphere,s
writing
that
I
am
obliged
to
do
for
myself.
For
instance,
I
cannot
remember
the
first
piece
of
writing
I
produced
for
my
teachers
in
elementary
school.
However,
I
can
remember
the
first
piece
of
writing
I
produced
for
myself.
Around
the
age
of
seven,
I
became
obsessed
with
toys
inspired
by
the
movie
101
Dalmatians;
this
obsession
led
to
the
creation
of
my
first
piece
of
prose,
a
short
story
entitled
rJewel
&
Lucky.s
The
story
has
a
simple
plotline:
a
girlus
parents
bring
home
two
new,
wonderful
puppies
named
Jewel
and
Lucky,
of
which
her
best
friend
becomes
envious.
In
an
act
of
selfishness,
the
best
friend
steals
the
puppies
from
the
yard
with
the
intention
of
hiding
and
keeping
them.
However,
as
she
realizes
the
pain
she
has
caused
her
best
friend,
she
is
remorseful
and
returns
the
animals;
happy
to
be
reunited
with
her
pets,
the
girl
forgives
her
friend
and
promises
that
she
can
come
over
and
play
with
them
as
much
as
she
wants,
as
long
as
she
never
does
something
as
selfish
again.
The
story
could
not
have
covered
more
than
three
loose-leaf
pages,
but
I
recall
the
excitement
with
which
I
rushed
to
staple
it
together
and
hand
it
to
my
father
to
read.
More
important
than
the
writing
was
the
pride
behind
it;
I
had
created
something,
something
that
my
family
seemed
to
enjoy.
rJewel
&
Luckys
is
the
first
story
that
I
remember
writing,
but
it
is
not
the
last,
nor
is
it
the
best
by
far.
Still,
it
is
the
one
I
will
always
remember,
because
I
can
tie
it
back
to
that
momentary
rush
of
pride.
While
rJewel
&
Luckys
was
written
simply
to
satisfy
my
own
creativity,
I
can
remember
several
pieces
written
in
elementary
school
that
were
the
products
of
academic
obligation.
The
PTA
of
my
school
district
sponsors
an
annual
creative
arts
contest
known
as
rReflections.s
Every
student
in
first
through
sixth
grade
must
enter
a
work
(whether
art,
music,
or
a
written
piece),
and
those
students
grades
seven
through
twelve
are
encouraged
to
enter
as
well.
Each
year
the
contest
has
a
different
theme;
members
of
the
PTA
read
and
critique
the
pieces,
and
various
honors
are
distributed
to
students
in
each
grade.
My
most
memorable
experiences
with
rReflectionss
occurred
in
fourth,
fifth,
and
sixth
grade.
These
experiences
most
likely
stand
out
because
they
are
the
first
few
times
that
I
remember
truly
being
commended
for
my
writing
ability.
The
recognition
received
from
rReflectionss
went
beyond
smiley
face
stickers
and
marks
on
my
report
card;
I
was
compared
to
students
in
other
classes,
not
just
my
own,
and
judged
on
something
far
more
personal
than
my
ability
to
answer
a
question,
or
recite
a
times
table.
In
fourth
grade,
the
theme
of
the
contest
was
rSuddenly
I
turn
aroundis
I
wrote
a
short
story
entitled
rSuddenly
I
turn
aroundiand
I
am
in
the
Civil
War!s
The
story
is
centered
on
a
boy
who
loathed
school,
especially
when
it
came
time
for
history
class.
One
day,
when
leaving
the
classroom
after
a
particularly
dull
lecture
on
the
Civil
War,
the
boy
finds
himself
not
in
one
of
the
school
corridors,
but
in
the
crossfire
of
the
war
he
had
just
been
learning
about.
His
experiences
with
the
soldiers
grant
him
a
new
appreciation
of
history;
when
he
finally
succeeds
in
finding
his
way
home,
he
wakes
up
at
his
school
desk,
only
to
realize
everything
he
has
been
through
has
been
nothing
more
than
a
midday
dream.
I
clearly
remember
the
day
they
announced
the
contest
winners;
I
was
sitting
at
my
desk,
and
as
they
reached
the
honorable
mentions
for
the
fourth
grade,
they
called
my
name.
All
of
my
classmates
turned
to
congratulate
me,
and
despite
the
fact
I
normally
shied
away
from
such
extended
attention,
I
sat
amazed
that
I
could
create
something
that
other
people
recognized
as
noteworthy.
It
had
never
dawned
on
me
that
something
I
enjoyed
doing,
something
that
had
meant
something
to
me,
could
ever
have
meaning
for
anyone
else.
Unfortunately,
my
fifth
grade
experience
was
less
inspiring.
I
had
written
a
piece
for
the
theme
rAnything
is
possibles
that
described
a
childus
struggle
to
regain
his
passion
for
the
game
that
had
ultimately
cost
him
his
grandfatherus
life.
After
being
struck
by
a
car
in
an
attempt
to
rescue
his
grandson
who
had
run
into
the
street
to
retrieve
his
basketball,
the
grandfather
passes
away.
The
child
finds
it
impossible
to
continue
playing
his
favorite
game
until
his
grandfatherus
spirit
visits
him
and
assures
him
that
everything
happens
for
a
reason,
and
if
given
a
million
chances,
he
would
have
done
nothing
differently.
My
story,
along
with
those
of
a
few
other
students
had
won
the
contest
for
my
schoolus
PTA;
however,
when
it
was
time
to
announce
those
who
were
to
advance
to
the
countyus
contest,
my
name
was
not
called.
I
stood
in
the
classroom
and
simply
stared
at
my
teacher
as
he
congratulated
my
best
friend,
whose
piece
had
advanced.
It
was
not
the
worst
rejection
that
I
have
ever
faced
in
my
career
as
a
writer,
but
it
crushed
my
eleven
year
old
self,
because
at
this
point
writing
had
become
tremendously
important
to
me.
The
more
I
realized
that
my
words
could
have
an
effect
on
people,
the
more
I
desired
to
write
things
that
would
mean
something
to
someone
else.
If
I
were
to
stand
back
and
examine
my
career
along
a
time
line,
that
is
the
one
thing
that
would
stand
out:
the
need
to
connect
with
other
people.
This
becomes
even
more
apparent
when
I
examine
the
importance
that
reading
has
had
in
my
life.
I
have
always
been
a
voracious
reader.
I
am
not
only
intrigued
by
the
countless
turns
of
plot
in
literature
that
grab
the
reader;
I
find
sincere
enjoyment
in
the
authorus
words.
It
is
the
combination
of
words,
the
way
they
accent
each
other,
the
way
they
can
define
success
or
failure
in
a
work
that
truly
excites
me.
There
have
been
plenty
of
times
that
I
have
disliked
a
piece
of
literature;
yet
I
am
almost
always
able
to
find
a
paragraph
or
turn
of
phrase
that
in
themselves
make
the
reading
worthwhile.
I
think
it
is
the
shadow
of
this
idea
that
made
my
fifth
grade
rejection
so
devastating.
I
had
never
previously
attempted
to
write
with
as
much
emotion
as
I
had
incorporated
into
rAnything
is
possible,s
and
my
failure
to
advance
meant
that
I
had
somehow
failed
to
convey
this
emotion
to
my
audience.
I
remember
the
least
about
the
contest
in
sixth
grade,
yet
it
was
undoubtedly
the
most
formative
with
regard
to
my
writing.
The
theme
was
rIt
would
be
really
strange
ifis
and
I
had
succeeded
in
waiting
until
the
very
last
moment
to
write
my
piece.
As
I
have
always
been
skilled
in
the
art
of
procrastination,
I
left
the
assignment
until
the
night
before
it
was
to
be
handed
in.
It
was
this
limitation
of
time,
coupled
with
severe
writerus
block,
which
led
me
to
the
genre
I
have
favored
ever
since:
poetry.
I
can
recall
slinking
away
into
my
den
as
my
parents
argued
over
how
best
to
help
me
finish
the
assignment;
while
they
bickered,
I
took
a
pen
to
some
loose-leaf
and
scribbled
out
a
poem
about
how
the
world
would
be
different
if
rdown
were
up,
and
up
were
downs
and
rheaven
were
hell,
and
hell
were
heaven.s
I
walked
back
into
the
kitchen
and
placed
the
poem
in
front
of
my
mom,
who
stopped
talking,
read
it,
and
smiled.
It
is
the
same
smile
I
was
greeted
with
by
my
sixth
grade
homeroom
teacher,
who
called
me
to
her
desk
the
next
morning
to
ask
if
I
had
really
written
the
poem
myself.
I
cannot
even
say
whether
I
advanced
in
the
contest;
all
I
can
remember
is
the
pride
of
the
adults
around
me
and
how
ecstatic
I
was
to
have
succeeded
in
a
form
of
writing
I
had
rarely
attempted
in
the
past.
After
that
initial
experience,
poetry
became
my
primary
creative
outlet.
While
I
continued
to
fulfill
my
academic
obligation
to
write,
I
began
to
feel
much
more
strongly
for
the
personal
obligation.
I
recall
being
amazed
that
so
concise
an
art
form
could
evoke
so
much
feeling;
my
experiences
reading
poetry
added
to
this
amazement.
In
elementary
school,
I
became
intrigued
by
the
poetry
of
writers
like
Jack
Prelutsky
and
Shel
Silverstein.
Their
poetry
excited
me;
it
made
me
laugh,
and
the
slight
twists
and
turns
they
achieved
with
so
few
words
surprised
me.
I
fell
in
love
with
the
element
of
surprise
to
be
found
in
poetry,
and
my
sixth
grade
triumph
cemented
this
passion.
While
much
of
the
writing
I
produced
in
elementary
school
served
to
fulfill
both
academic
and
personal
desires,
the
two
spheres
into
which
I
divide
my
writing
truly
defined
themselves
throughout
middle
school
and
high
school.
Although
I
believe
that
creativity
has
fueled
my
higher
level
writing,
it
has
not
been
the
only
factor.
The
most
important
fact
that
I
have
realized
about
the
various
forms
of
writing
attempted
throughout
my
high
school
career
is
that
academic
forms
tend
to
be
rather
formulaic.
For
example,
once
I
had
been
taught
how
to
properly
analyze
a
piece
of
literature
or
defend
a
general
argument,
creating
research
papers
or
writing
papers
for
English
became
relatively
easy.
While
the
preparation
has
its
difficulties,
the
writing
itself
has
rarely
pained
me
for
the
sheer
fact
that
most
of
my
academic
writing
up
to
this
point
has
been
created
in
similar
fashions.
Whether
it
be
a
research
paper
for
English,
or
an
argument
essay
for
history,
each
genre
has
a
unique
formula
that,
once
learned,
is
easy
to
repeat
and
mold
for
any
number
of
topics
and
courses.
It
is
the
combination
of
the
two,
the
creative
and
the
formulaic,
which
has
given
me
some
of
my
greatest
challenges,
as
well
as
some
of
my
greatest
rewards.
In
eighth
grade,
my
class
was
given
an
assignment
to
produce
an
editorial
on
a
topic
of
our
choosing.
We
were
taught
the
basics
behind
journalistic
and
editorial
writing,
and
from
there
we
were
expected
to
create
our
own.
I
remember
constantly
struggling
with
the
assignment.
I
could
not
manage
to
find
a
topic
interesting
enough
to
write
about,
and
when
I
would
tentatively
choose
a
topic,
I
could
not
seem
to
write
a
draft
that
I
thought
was
good
enough.
One
day,
I
approached
my
teacher
to
ask
for
help.
When
I
explained
my
struggle,
she
advised
me
to
simply
sit
down
and
let
the
words
come
out
rather
than
over
think
them,
as
I
had
indeed
been
doing.
I
do
not
know
why,
but
her
suggestion
seemed
to
resonate
with
me,
and
in
those
brief
minutes
I
not
only
developed
a
topic
that
moved
me
but
was
able
to
draft
a
piece
that
I
finally
had
pride
in.
I
decided
to
write
about
the
events
of
September
11th,
and
whether
it
would
be
wise
to
rebuild
the
World
Trade
Center
in
lieu
of
such
devastating
a
tragedy.
Rather
than
stick
to
the
rigid
formula
I
had
been
using
to
draft
my
previous
editorials,
I
wrote
this
piece
as
I
would
have
a
poem.
I
blended
the
opinion
and
the
factual
with
the
figurative,
and
by
doing
so
experienced
one
of
the
best
receptions
my
writing
has
ever
known.
I
impressed
my
teachers
and
my
parents,
as
well
as
my
peers,
but
more
importantly,
I
got
the
chance
to
see
the
kind
of
affect
my
writing
could
have
on
others.
Both
the
subject
matter
and
the
writing
meant
something
to
those
who
read
it,
which
in
turn
meant
everything
to
me.
That
was
the
first
time
I
knew
that
writing
was
something
I
truly
did
well,
and
it
was
something
that
I
wanted
to
do
forever.
It
also
inspired
a
brief
tryst
with
journalism
my
junior
and
senior
year
of
high
school.
The
memory
of
the
editorial
has
stuck
with
me
throughout
my
career
as
a
writer,
and
it
is
part
of
the
reason
that
I
contacted
my
townus
local
newspaper
and
asked
to
be
a
student
writer.
The
editor
agreed
to
let
me
publish
articles
at
my
leisure,
acting
as
a
sort
of
liaison
between
the
world
of
adults
and
that
of
the
average
high
school
student.
I
quickly
realized,
however,
that
there
was
much
less
room
for
the
figurative
in
this
position.
Despite
my
success
with
the
editorial,
I
found
myself
constantly
at
odds
with
the
editor
of
the
paper.
I
have
always
been
protective
of
the
things
that
I
write,
as
so
much
of
myself
is
invested
in
the
pieces
I
create.
Unfortunately,
I
tend
to
be
verbose
at
times,
and
when
the
editor
attempted
to
make
my
articles
more
concise,
I
found
myself
disagreeing
with
what
was
presented
in
the
edited
versions.
While
I
did
not
enjoy
having
my
writing
constantly
torn
apart,
I
did
appreciate
the
experience
and
learned
that
my
writing
will
not
always
be
praised.
The
editor
was
tough
on
me,
but
it
humbled
me,
and
it
also
made
me
push
myself
even
further
to
write
articles
that
were
not
only
interesting,
but
also
strived
to
meet
his
technical
standards.
Although
academic
writing
became
the
primary
focus
during
these
years,
the
personal
sphere
became
increasingly
more
important
after
sophomore
year.
I
had
made
small
attempts
to
maintain
my
creative
side
during
this
time,
but
my
passion
for
poetry
truly
resurged
halfway
through
high
school.
One
day
after
school,
I
was
sitting
at
the
computer,
when
out
of
nowhere
I
had
the
strong
urge
to
open
up
a
word
processor
and
write
down
a
few
short
lines
that
had
been
lingering
in
my
mind.
Those
few
short
lines
developed
into
three
separate
poems,
all
of
which
I
presented
to
my
father
when
he
came
home
from
work
that
evening.
When
it
comes
to
poetry,
the
writing
of
which
I
am
most
protective,
I
have
never
hesitated
to
share
my
poems
with
my
dad.
He
is
the
type
of
person
who
always
gives
an
honest
opinion,
whether
positive
or
negative,
and
although
I
do
not
always
agree
with
him,
I
value
his
opinion.
That
night
he
read
each
poem,
looked
me
in
the
eyes,
and
told
me
that
he
thought
they
were
excellent.
I
think
the
most
shocking
part
of
it
was
that
I
could
not
say
from
where
or
why
I
had
written
them;
they
had
just
come,
and
they
were
good,
and
I
once
again
felt
that
rush
of
pride
that
had
accompanied
my
first
real
attempt
at
writing.
I
have
actively
continued
to
write
poetry
since
that
point,
and
though
I
sometimes
hit
stretches
of
writerus
block,
I
still
feel
those
sudden
urges
to
write
a
poem,
whether
it
be
in
the
middle
of
writing
a
paper
for
class,
or
the
middle
of
running
a
morning
errand.
I
am
continuously
proud
of
my
achievements
in
the
academic
sphere
and
the
recognition
I
am
able
to
receive
from
my
peers;
yet
nothing
means
more
to
me
than
the
sheets
of
poetry
I
print
out
and
hand
to
my
father,
whether
or
not
they
are
ever
seen
by
anyone
elseus
eyes.
Coming
to
Lafayette
and
writing
for
college
courses
has
undoubtedly
presented
new
challenges
and
difficulties;
many
of
my
rformulass
have
had
to
change,
and
I
find
myself
struggling
to
cater
to
a
very
new
and
very
wide
range
of
literary
tastes.
The
writing
done
for
my
FYS
alone
taught
me
that
in
order
to
keep
up
with
college
level
writing
I
would
have
to
compromise
some
of
my
routine
techniques
and
long
held
beliefs
about
various
writing
forms.
However,
even
now,
I
am
still
in
love
with
the
power
of
the
written
word
and
what
it
has
meant
to
me
to
be
able
to
write
and
share
that
writing
with
others.
Becoming
a
Writing
Associate
has
only
furthered
this
ideal.
I
can
now
help
others
to
accomplish
exactly
what
I
have
strived
for
since
the
age
of
seven:
using
the
written
word
to
make
someone,
somewhere,
feel
the
way
I
feel
when
I
put
my
pen
to
paper.
