Literary
Narrative
When
I
first
began
school
I
was
so
painfully
shy
that
my
kindergarten
teacher
thought
I
was
one
of
the
slow
students
and
put
me
in
the
remedial
groups.
Although
I
entered
school
fully
capable
of
reading
and
able
to
write
at
least
small
words,
she
thought
I
couldn't
read
because
I
was
too
shy
to
speak
in
class.
When
I
entered
first
grade,
I
had
a
more
sympathetic
teacher
who
began
to
draw
me
out
of
my
shell.
She
noticed
that
my
writing
skills
did
not
match
those
in
the
remedial
reading
group
I
was
placed
in,
and
spoke
to
my
parents
about
placing
me
in
the
program
for
accelerated
students.
I
loved
her
for
that,
and
I
really
enjoyed
writing
for
her
from
then
on
out.
My
earliest
memories
of
writing
are
probably
no
different
from
those
of
anyone
else.
I
remember
composing
short
paragraphs
on
those
large
green
sheets
of
paper
with
the
doublespaced
lines.
Thinking
of
topics
to
write
about
was
never
a
problem
for
me
in
elementary
school;
I
loved
to
create
stories
and
write
about
memories
and
events
from
my
own
life.
My
handwriting
was
horrible
though,
so
although
all
of
my
teachers
praised
my
content,
I
was
sometimes
called
to
their
desks
to
translate
my
chicken
scratch.
Once
we
learned
cursive
it
only
got
worse,
so
on
occasion
a
teacher
would
let
me
write
in
print
just
so
I
could
turn
in
a
legible
assignment.
My
parents
saved
some
of
my
assignments
from
elementary
school
in
a
scrapbook,
and
as
I
read
them
now
I'm
surprised
by
some
of
the
subjects
I
wrote
about.
Some
were
very
typical:
"If
I
could
invent
a
robot,
I
would..."
I
wrote
about
a
powerful
robot
able
to
beat
up
my
older
brothers.
Others
are
more
touching
however.
One
story
my
parents
saved
is
about
my
great-uncle's
death.
I
wrote
it
in
the
second
grade,
and
reading
it
now,
I
cannot
believe
I
would
have
handed
it
in
for
someone
else
to
read.
In
high
school
and
college,
I
have
rarely
voluntarily
allowed
someone
other
than
the
professor
or
teacher
grading
the
assignment
to
read
my
writing.
And
despite
the
fact
that
I
overcame
my
shyness,
I
am
still
embarrassed
when
asked
to
read
my
writing
aloud
to
the
class.
I
think
a
lot
of
people
have
similar
feelings
about
having
their
work
read
by
others,
and
I
am
pretty
sure
about
why
I
developed
mine.
One
of
the
assignments
for
our
third
grade
teacher
was
to
keep
a
daily
journal
that
would
be
graded
at
the
end
of
each
week.
We
had
fifteen
minutes
to
write
the
graded
material
in
it,
and
then
another
five
to
write
a
personal
journal
entry
in
the
back
pages
that
the
teacher
would
not
read.
A
friend
of
mine
stole
my
journal
one
day
and
read
the
whole
thing.
She
had
stolen
two
other
journals
as
well,
and
once
she
was
caught
she
apologized
and
the
teacher
discontinued
the
practice.
I
remained
upset
however,
and
became
very
selective
about
who
I
allowed
to
read
my
work.
The
first
writing
assignment
I
remember
doing
poorly
on
was
a
book
report
I
wrote
in
the
fifth
grade.
It
was
also
the
first
writing
assignment
I
remember
disliking.
I
chose
to
write
about
one
of
the
"Babysitter's
Club"
series.
I
read
the
book
quickly
enough,
but
I
had
no
idea
where
to
start
the
report.
I
procrastinated
for
the
first
time
ever.
My
mother
finally
dragged
the
details
of
the
plot
out
of
me,
and
suggested
I
start
by
describing
each
of
the
characters.
The
beginning
of
my
report
was
horrible;
it
was
so
broad
and
general
that
it
could
have
been
about
any
one
of
the
books
in
the
series.
I
hated
writing
it
and
remember
thinking
how
long
it
was
taking.
When
I
got
towards
the
end
of
the
book
though,
I
was
so
interested
in
the
plot
that
my
writing
style
did
a
complete
180-degree
turn.
I
included
every
detail
I
possibly
could.
I
stuck
quotations
into
every
paragraph,
as
well
as
running
commentary
on
the
action.
My
report
on
the
last
chapter
was
as
long
as
my
report
on
the
rest
of
the
book.
I
don't
remember
the
grade
I
received,
but
I
believe
it
was
fairly
low.
Until
then,
I
had
only
gotten
A's
on
my
writing,
so
this
was
a
big
blow.
It
taught
me
a
lesson
about
writing
that
I
never
forgot
though.
From
that
point
on
I
made
a
concentrated
effort
to
integrate
those
two
types
of
writing,
so
I
would
not
turn
in
such
a
fragmented
assignment
again.
My
academic
writing
style
became
broader
after
that,
and
I
sometimes
had
problems
with
assuming
that
my
reader
understood
the
details
of
my
report
as
well
as
I
did.
Elementary
school
was
also
the
place
where
I
learned
to
like
poetry.
When
I
was
about
seven
years
old
I
began
writing
poetry
in
my
free
time.
My
school
put
out
a
literary
magazine
at
the
end
of
each
year
with
a
selection
of
writing
from
each
student
in
it.
I
wrote
a
poem
for
it
every
year;
usually
one
that
rhymed,
but
by
the
time
I
was
11,
I
didn't
feel
the
need
to
stick
to
that
pattern
any
longer.
I
wrote
a
poem
that
year
about
my
best
friend
and
entered
it
into
a
local
poetry
contest.
I
got
an
honorable
mention,
but
I
didn't
win
one
of
the
top
three
prizes
so
I
was
disappointed.
Imagine
my
surprise
when
I
got
a
call
a
few
weeks
later
from
Connecticut
Teen
magazine
asking
if
they
could
publish
my
poem.
Apparently
one
of
the
magazine's
reporters
had
seen
it
displayed
in
the
town
library
and
wanted
to
use
it
to
start
a
poetry
comer
in
their
magazine.
I
was
thrilled,
but
for
some
reason
instead
of
sparking
me
to
continue
writing
poetry,
I
slowly
stopped
after
I
was
published.
I
never
attempt
it
anymore.
I
don't
remember
very
much
about
writing
in
middle
school.
When
I
was
in
the
seventh
grade
we
got
a
used
computer
that
was
really
nothing
more
than
a
word
processor.
I
was
overjoyed.
The
only
way
I
had
fixed
my
handwriting
was
to
learn
to
write
very
slowly,
which
was
impossible
for
me
to
do
when
writing
a
paper.
In
sixth
grade
we
had
started
typing
courses
and
having
the
computer
at
home
meant
that
I
could
finally
write
as
quickly
as
I
needed
to.
The
one
writing
experience
that
sticks
out
in
my
mind
from
middle
school
was
in
eighth
grade.
Mrs.
Dunn
asked
the
class
to
divide
itself
into
pairs.
She
told
us
we
would
all
be
writing
a
ten
page
fictional
story
about
any
subject
we
wished.
This
was
a
big
deal
for
a
few
reasons:
first,
writing
ten
pages
was
an
unheard
of
task
at
that
time,
and
I
thought
it
would
take
forever.
Second,
the
four
top
students
in
the
class
had
paired
up;
my
best
friend
Rachel
and
I,
and
Beau
and
Ryan.
Rachel
and
I
were
already
in
a
friendly
competition
to
see
who
was
the
better
student,
so
we
immediately
knew
that
our
goal
was
to
put
Beau
and
Ryan
to
shame.
Writing
the
story
was
a
little
difficult.
Rachel
and
I
both
had
definite
ideas
of
style
and
plot
that
didn't
always
coincide.
Neither
of
us
wanted
the
other
to
do
more
work
because
we
each
wanted
maximum
input.
It
was
much
more
difficult
than
writing
a
researched
report
with
someone
else,
where
style
matters
less
and
you
can
legitimately
claim
responsibility
only
for
the
areas
of
the
report
you
worked
on.
We
felt
that
with
a
story,
if
it
were
clearly
the
work
of
two
separate
people,
it
would
take
attention
away
from
the
plot.
We
made
it
through
without
a
major
fight,
and
our
story
ended
up
with
the
highest
grade
in
the
class.
It
was
also
the
one
piece
of
writing
that
I
was
happy
to
read
aloud.
Freshman
year
of
high
school
introduced
lab
reports
for
Mr.
Pelczar.
It
was
hard
for
me
to
learn
how
to
write
in
sharp
detail
but
without
unnecessary
flourish.
Although
he
never
took
points
off
my
lab
reports,
Mr.
Pelczar
often
added
tips
about
how
to
write
scientifically
along
with
the
grade.
I
haven't
had
to
do
much
of
that
type
of
writing
since
high
school,
but
my
astronomy
reports
definitely
helped
me
get
through
four
years
of
high
school
labs.
One
of
the
most
influential
teachers
I've
ever
had
was
Mr.
Tucci
in
sophomore
English.
He
was
a
football
coach
who
ran
the
class
like
a
drill
sergeant.
On
the
first
day
of
class
he
announced
that
we
would
be
writing
5-
7
page
papers
with
1,500
to
2,000
words
every
week
for
the
next
2
months.
He
assigned
the
first
topic
and
said
it
was
due
that
next
Friday.
No
one
in
class
got
above
a
C+
on
that
first
paper.
I
received
a
C
and
was
devastated.
He
ripped
my
paper
to
shreds,
pointing
out
all
of
its
flaws
in
bright
red
ink.
At
the
end
of
the
paper
was
a
page-long
commentary
stapled
to
the
back
page,
which
basically
said,
this
paper
is
awful.
His
teaching
style
was
completely
new
to
the
entire
class,
as
was
the
idea
of
writing
such
long
papers
every
week.
He
hammered
away
at
his
points
though,
and
those
ofus
who
were
lucky
gradually
transformed
ourselves
into
better
writers.
We
learned
about
the
importance
of
introductions,
theses,
and
topic
sentences.
He
taught
us
grammar
rules
that
we
had
never
learned
and
explained
to
us
some
of
the
reasons
why
good
writing
was
considered
good.
He
even
brought
in
a
senior
thesis
from
a
college
student
he
knew,
and
went
through
it
with
us
to
show
us
how
a
good
research
paper
is
organized.
After
he
showed
us
that,
he
had
us
all
research
a
historical
figure
and
write
a
15-page
biography
of
their
life.
He
took
us
through
the
process
step
by
step,
and
I
learned
how
to
completely
research
something
from
a
variety
of
sources,
rather
than
just
skimming
a
few
books.
By
the
end
of
the
year,
I
had
received
maybe
a
grand
total
of
four
A's
on
his
papers,
but
I
felt
I
had
earned
every
one.
When
he
praised
your
writing
you
learned
almost
as
much
as
when
he
criticized
it.
I
came
out
of
his
class
a
much
better
writer
than
I
had
ever
been
before.
After
the
crash
course
in
writing
that
I
received
from
Mr.
Tucci,
it
was
disappointing
to
go
into
my
other
classes
and
hand
in
assignments
for
them.
Most
of
the
other
teachers
didn't
have
standards
as
high
as
his,
and
were
content
to
assign
research
reports
that
were
more
or
less
book
reports.
We
were
not
required
to
write
with
any
sort
of
thesis
in
mind,
and
the
papers
tended
to
seem
beneath
us
after
the
rigors
of
Mr.
Tucci.
My
next
great
teacher
came
senior
year,
and
she
was
also
an
English
teacher.
Ms.
Shea
was
not
as
much
of
a
disciplinarian
as
Mr.
Tucci,
but
her
approach
was
similar.
Every
week
during
the
first
semester
we
had
a
6-8
page
paper
due.
And
everyone,
myself
included,
did
below
average
on
the
first
five
or
six
papers.
Ms.
Shea
emphasized
argumentation
in
her
papers.
I
couldn't
understand
what
she
wanted
at
first.
I
thought
I
had
just
learned
all
of
this
from
Mr.
Tucci,
and
I
couldn't
understand
why
my
writing
suddenly
wasn't
good
enough
again.
The
class
was
AP
English,
and
she
wanted
to
treat
us
as
if
we
were
college
students,
she
explained.
She
had
us
purchase
a
book
on
argumentation
in
writing
and
read
a
chapter
each
week
along
with
our
other
assignments.
She
was
the
one
who
finally
taught
me
how
to
balance
detail
with
generality
in
my
writing,
and
was
good
enough
to
read
two
or
three
drafts
of
a
paper
before
grading
it.
In
AP
English,
I
learned
to
write
with
an
immediate
deadline.
My
sophomore
year,
I
would
write
my
papers
days
or
weeks
in
advance
if
possible.
My
senior
year
I
was
hit
with
pneumonia,
mono,
and
a
car
accident
each
at
different
times
that
kept
me
absent
for
long
periods
throughout
the
year
.To
keep
up
with
my
assignments,
I
often
ended
up
writing
my
papers
the
night
before
they
were
due.
Although
I
realize
this
is
not
the
best
method
of
writing,
I
think
it
helped
me
learn
from
Ms.
Shea
faster.
If
I
wanted
to
have
a
decent
grade,
I
couldn't
write
and
rewrite
my
papers,
perfecting
them
each
time;
I
had
to
concentrate
on
all
the
aspects
she
was
looking
for
and
be
sure
to
include
them
the
first
time
through.
I
hadn't
thought
it
was
possible
to
grow
so
much
as
a
writer
twice
in
two
years,
but
I
was
very
wrong.
I
left
that
class
completely
prepared
for
my
first
semester
of
college
writing.
My
FYS
was
not
a
challenge
to
me
in
the
least
in
terms
of
writing.
We
had
three
5-7
page
papers,
and
one
longer
one
as
a
final.
While
some
of
the
other
students
were
complaining
about
the
length
and
number
of
papers,
it
was
a
breeze
for
me
after
AP
English.
During
my
senior
year
of
high
school,
I
felt
that
my
writing
was
the
best
it
could
possibly
be.
I
haven't
felt
that
way
since.
I
rarely
met
with
my
WA's
freshman
year,
both
because
I
was
procrastinating
and
because
I
didn't
want
another
student
to
read
my
work
and
I
think
it
was
poor.
I
still
received
mainly
A's
on
my
papers
though.
