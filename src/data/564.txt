I
was
exposed
to
the
written
word
at
a
very
young
age.
I,
like
any
child,
had
my
favorite
books
that
were
read
and
reread
countless
times
to
me.
My
mother
and
I
used
to
walk
to
the
library
twice
a
week
where
we
would
explore
the
many
shelves
and
different
genres.
I
remember
one
book
in
particular
called
Pig
William.
It
was
largely
about
a
teenage
pig
getting
ready
to
go
to
school.
There
was
one
page
in
particular
where
he
feeds
his
fish
Pinky
and
utters
a
short
ode
to
him:
vFishy
Pinky
little
and
dinky,
Eating
big
fish
chow,
Poor
Pinky,
too
big
for
the
sinky,
Must
play
in
the
bathtub
now1.g
As
a
little
kid
I
didnet
understand
literary
techniques
or
mechanisms
and
I
obviously
couldnet
comprehend
poetry
or
its
complexities.
Reading
simply
brought
new
adventures
and
by
the
time
I
was
old
enough
for
school,
I
was
very
eager
to
learn
more.
Mrs.
Rouleau
taught
the
first
grade
at
Shaker
Lane
Elementary
School.
She
taught
me
two
things
that
I
can
remember:
1.
vChange
the
d-ye
to
d-ie
and
add
d-eseg
and
2.
The
reason
there
is
a
long
d-ae
in
the
word
dmadee.
vThe
dee
reaches
around
the
dde
and
pinches
the
dae
in
the
bottom,
so
the
dae
screams
daaaaayyyye.
I
vividly
remember
only
that
word
written
in
chalk
on
the
long
blackboard
that
spanned
the
length
of
our
little
classroom.
She
held
a
long,
wooden
dowel
pointer
with
a
small
rubber
hand
on
the
tip.
I
had
to
write
the
word
dmadee
repeatedly
on
wide
ruled
handwriting
sheets
with
the
little
blue
dashed
line
guiding
my
every
stroke.
My
second
grade
class
was
run
by
Mrs.
McGrath,
a
freckled,
curly
haired,
stout
little
woman.
Her
smile
was
contagious
and
so
was
her
enthusiasm
towards
academics.
I
remember
our
class
received
four
computers
for
Christmas
from
the
local
Hewlett
Packard
Branch.
Mrs.
McGrath
catered
many
lesson
plans
to
the
new
technology,
utilizing
them
whenever
possible.
I
remember
learning
about
animals
and
being
assigned
a
report
on
beavers.
Each
student
was
responsible
for
a
typed
paper
and
some
form
of
artistic
rendition
of
their
animal.
I
had
little
to
no
knowledge
of
computers
at
the
age
of
seven
and
was
very
overwhelmed.
I
remember
sitting
in
my
office
at
home
with
my
Dad,
telling
him
that
I
couldnet
spell
well
and
didnet
understand
how
I
was
supposed
to
type
things
I
couldnet
write
out
normally.
He
sat
me
down
on
his
lap,
took
my
hands
in
his,
and
helped
me
type
word
for
word
my
beaver
report.
Mrs.
Patriquin
taught
my
fourth
grade
class.
I
remember
studying
both
geography
and
cursive
simultaneously.
She
combined
these
two
misfortunes
into
one
massive
project:
the
state
report
written
entirely
in
cursive
handwriting.
I
was
assigned
Nebraska
the
state
of
all
states.
I
donet
think
I
learned
anything
about
it,
other
than
all
of
its
corn,
wheat
and
the
glorious
Chimney
Rock.
I
think
this
paper
was
one
of
my
first
research
projects
and
I
was
still
unfamiliar
with
libraries
and
research
techniques.
The
fifth
grade
was
taught
by
none
other
than
Mrs.
Nancy
Jasayne.
Her
class
brought
all
sorts
of
literature.
I
remember
her
riding
a
broom
around
the
classroom
dressed
in
colonial
attire
reciting
all
of
dPaul
Reverees
Ridee
to
our
class.
Our
class
that
year
was
unfortunately
her
guinea
pig
for
her
masteres
thesis
in
education.
We
read
loads
of
Judy
Blume,
Roald
Dahl
and
R.L.
Stein.
Mrs.
Jasayne
also
introduced
us
to
general
poetry
and
various
historical
contexts.
We
began
themed
writing
in
preparation
for
our
state
exams
that
would
take
place
within
the
next
year.
I
remember
she
was
also
the
first
teacher
to
give
me
a
final
end
of
year
exam.
It
consisted
of
a
dword
splashe
which
was
essentially
a
piece
of
computer
paper
filled
with
topic-related
words.
Our
topic:
American
history.
We
had
to
write
an
essay,
in
all
cursive
writing
that
used
every
one
of
the
words
on
the
dword
splashe
page.
I
learned
to
hate
the
final
exam
at
age
eleven.
Junior
High
School
was
perhaps
the
most
influential
on
my
literary
history.
Mrs.
Hart
was
my
seventh
grade
English
teacher.
She
didnet
really
mold
me
as
a
writer
per
say,
but
she
did
introduce
higher
level
literaturebThe
Call
of
the
Wild
in
particular.
Mr.
Todd
Giabbai
was
my
history
teacher
that
year,
a
new
hire
fresh
out
of
graduate
school.
On
parentes
night,
he
pledged
to
our
families
that
he
would
teach
each
of
his
students
to
write
effectively.
He
confessed
that
we
pupils
may
not
recall
all
of
history
after
having
taken
his
course,
but
he
swore
that
his
specialty
was
writing,
and
that
is
what
he
intended
to
teach.
My
parents
left
his
classroom
that
night,
not
knowing
whether
or
not
to
take
him
seriously.
The
little
5e4g
man
was
fresh
out
of
school,
inexperienced
with
pubescent
school
kids,
and
dressed
and
acted
very
flamboyant.
He
kept
his
word
though
and
single-handedly
taught
me
more
about
writing
than
anyone
else
up
to
that
point.
His
history
and
geography
class
still
went
into
great
detail,
exploring
ancient
Mesopotamia,
Babylon,
and
Egypt.
At
one
point
we
even
dabbled
in
the
Epic
of
Gilgamesh,
a
text
normally
covered
in
college,
that
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
study
at
age
thirteen.
Mr.
Giabbai
through
this
vast
array
of
international
texts
enforced
critical
thinking,
supporting
evidence,
and
research
projects.
He
was
the
first
to
really
teach
me
how
to
write
a
bibliography
and
present
my
research
orally.
Ninth
grade
introduced
me
to
the
classic
dWordly
Wiseeba
small,
thin,
vintage
notebook,
lacking
a
cover
whose
purpose
was
to
enrich
my
vocabulary
via
multiple,
repeated
exercises
on
the
same
tireless
words,
week
after
week.
I
will
never
forget
the
definitions
of
words
like
dgirde
and
dfactotume
which
were
subject
to
such
exercises
as
fill-in-the-blank,
define,
and
use-in-a-sentence.
This
tedious
and
dry
text
was
used
each
year
by
my
English
teachers
in
high
school
as
a
supplement
in
study
materials
for
state
exams.
Fortunately
for
Mrs.
Regina
Chaple,
my
freshman
year
teacher,
she
taught
me
other
things,
like
analysis
of
the
classics.
We
read
Romeo
and
Juliet
and
The
Odyssey.
She
also
taught
me
everything
I
currently
know
about
literary
conventions
and
techniques
as
well
as
how
to
break
apart
literary
works
and
read
into
their
many
levels.
Mrs.
Chaple
also
loved
to
prove
whenever
possible
that
virtually
every
text
contains
sexual
undertones
or
was
written
essentially
for
a
sexual
purpose.
I
remember
our
class
acting
out
Romeo
and
Juliet
and
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
play
the
role
of
the
nurse.
Practically
everything
that
character
says
is
saturated
with
dirty
humor.
I
remember
Mrs.
Chaple
also
tying
our
Shakespeare
lessons
into
poetry.
She
taught
me
how
to
dissect
and
analyze
as
well
as
to
write
fluidly.
To
demonstrate
this,
we
each
had
a
small
poetry
project
at
the
end
of
the
year
that
incorporated
all
the
literary
conventions
we
had
learned
and
discussed.
Mrs.
Chaple
was
also
the
first
teacher
to
expose
me
to
writing
materials,
one
text
in
particular
called
Writers
Inc.
that
I
still
keep
in
my
dorm
room.
Not
only
did
Mrs.
Chaple
enrich
my
literary
history,
she
also
put
up
with
my
endless
shenanigans
and
tomfoolery.
Nelina
Backman
arrived
from
teaching
at
Boston
University
to
my
junior
year
English
class
in
small
town
suburbia.
I
remember
walking
in
the
first
day
to
a
dark
classroom,
lit
only
from
the
available
light
coming
in
from
our
streaky
windows.
Each
desk
had
a
massive
binder,
equipped
with
3
pencils
and
scrap
paper.
A
figure
was
seated
on
the
front
table,
cross-legged,
dressed
in
a
monochrome
color
pallet,
drinking
from
what
appeared
to
be
a
vase
filled
with
tonic
water.
On
the
very
first
day
of
class
she
instructed
us
take
notes
from
the
large
binder,
which
contained
our
townes
curriculum
requirements.
With
five
minutes
left
of
that
period,
she
asked
us
for
our
input
on
the
assignment.
We
were
all
confused
and
frustrated
at
the
massive
waste
of
time.
She
simply
said
that
everything
we
just
dabsorbede
was
to
never
to
be
discussed
again.
Ms.
Backman
instead
introduced
many
European
classics,
short
stories,
college
essay
writing,
research
papers,
editing
and
everything
else
under
the
sun.
She
introduced
a
new
concept
that
no
other
teacher
had
mentioned
beforebrewriting
papers.
Ms.
Backman
would
extensively
edit
our
first
drafts,
covering
our
paper
with
scribbled
pencil
marks
and
comments,
leaving
all
of
us
honor
kids
in
panic
and
distress.
She
told
us
the
truth,
whether
we
liked
it
or
not
and
really
challenged
us
to
work
at
a
higher
level.
As
honors
students
we
had
never
really
been
tested,
as
most
teachers
up
to
that
point
assumed
we
were
more
competent
than
in
actuality.
Ms.
Backman
did
not
just
challenge
us
in
the
classroom.
She
had
our
class
take
field
trips
outside
school
hours
to
UMASS
Lowelles
campus
library
to
learn
about
periodical
research
and
annotations.
She
wanted
us
all
to
be
prepared
for
college-level
research
and
to
see
how
large
libraries
are
organized,
since
our
high
school
was
very
small
and
limited
in
its
resources.
Through
all
of
our
research
she
began
to
enforce
the
thesis
statement
and
our
understanding
and
ability
to
develop
and
support
it
in
our
writing.
The
first
half
of
my
year
with
her
consisted
of
introductions
to
a
variety
of
international
literature
and
the
rules
of
their
compositions.
The
second
half
of
the
year,
I
learned
to
break
these
rules
and
write
creatively.
Ms.
Backman
also
worked
as
an
editor
for
Bedford
Saint
Martins
before
Boston
University.
At
the
end
of
the
year
she
gave
me
many
writing
materials
and
resources
that
I
keep
with
me
at
college
today.
She
graduated
from
Brown
University
at
the
top
of
her
class
and
encouraged
many
of
us
in
my
honors
course
to
aim
high.
My
senior
year
had
one
literary
endeavorbthe
college
essay.
We
were
expected
to
write
and
perfect
this
document
by
the
end
of
the
first
semester.
My
AP
English
teacher
was
new
that
year
from
another
small
school
system
west
of
my
high
school.
Her
methods
of
teaching
didnet
really
mesh
well
with
me
and
I
canet
say
that
I
absorbed
much
that
year.
One
positive
outcome
of
that
class
was
my
growth
as
an
independent
learner.
My
path
to
the
college
essay
began
like
any
other
students,
confusion
and
frustration
at
where
to
begin.
I
was
always
told
to
write
about
something
significant
or
important
to
me,
but
I
didnet
want
to
write
something
stereotypical.
I
wanted
to
stick
out
and
have
those
in
the
admissions
office
remember
my
paper.
I
kept
in
contact
with
Ms.
Backman,
my
previous
English
teacher,
and
worked
with
her
to
choose
an
experience
to
write
about.
I
managed
to
make
a
European
excursion
and
its
mishap
into
a
comical
narrative,
demonstrating
both
my
character
and
handiness.
The
experience
made
a
humorous
college
essay
that
was
truly
my
own.
In
my
acceptance
letter
to
Lafayette,
the
admissions
office
even
referred
to
my
friend
and
her
overseas
misfortune.
Once
at
Lafayette,
I
wasnet
really
sure
where
my
writing
would
stand
academically.
I
didnet
know
what
to
expect.
I
also
didnet
think
my
small
town
education
would
be
up
to
par
with
my
many
private-schooled
peers.
My
FYS
was
science
themed
and
filled
with
students
that
were
biology,
chemistry,
biochemistry,
and
engineering
majors.
Our
teacher
was
very
established
in
his
respective
field
and
his
mere
presence
had
us
all
nervous
from
the
start.
He
demonstrated
and
promoted
scientific
literacy
constantly.
If
we
were
all
to
go
into
scientific
disciplines,
he
wanted
to
make
sure
that
we
could
all
effectively
communicate
our
findings
and
understand
the
research
of
others.
He
was
also
one
of
the
first
teachers
to
have
me
read
multiple
accounts
of
the
same
scientific
story
and
emphasize
that
science,
like
all
other
areas
has
different
perspectives
and
interpretations.
The
concepts
I
gained
in
his
course
have
helped
me
modify
my
writing
to
cater
to
my
audience.
My
college
writing
course
was
also
science
themed.
Although
this
time
the
students
in
it
were
from
all
sorts
of
backgrounds.
Instead
of
focusing
of
specifically
scientific
doctrine,
we
worked
in
a
more
broad
sense.
This
work
ethic
frightened
me.
I
was
nervous
enough
to
have
a
legitimate
dEnglishe
professor
read
and
critique
my
work,
and
now
I
had
to
think
and
work
in
a
more
abstract
manner.
She
highlighted
concepts
and
techniques
in
her
class,
especially
the
skill
of
peer
editing.
I
learned
to
work
with
writers
of
different
disciplines
and
levels.
I
became
better
at
evaluating
ideas
and
textual
concepts,
rather
than
looking
for
specific
grammatical
errors.
My
college
writing
class
also
included
a
research
project.
For
the
first
time
in
my
literary
career
I
learned
how
to
make
and
present
a
scientific
poster.
I
also
had
to
comprise
a
portfolio
of
my
semesteres
work,
another
new
experience
for
me.
My
VAST
was
yet
another
scientific
writing
course.
I
found
myself
once
again
surrounded
by
many
familiar
faces
of
students
I
had
taken
most
of
my
general
science
courses
with.
I
had
even
taken
a
class
of
the
professor
prior
to
this.
The
course
was
yet
another
opportunity
for
me
to
modify
my
writing
to
be
more
audience
specific.
We
focused
on
stereotypes
and
their
effects.
Our
class
was
entirely
comprised
of
science
majors
and
we
all
could
relate
to
being
typecast
as
a
group
of
individuals
on
this
basis.
I
bettered
my
analytical
skills
and
also
was
able
to
focus
additionally
on
evaluating
scientific
articles.
Throughout
all
of
my
literary
endeavors,
my
family
has
still
remained
my
biggest
critic.
Both
of
my
parents
come
from
medical
and
technological
backgrounds,
yet
throughout
my
life
both
of
them
have
stressed
the
importance
of
effective
communication.
As
a
child
I
always
had
them
both
read
my
papers
and
projects
and
even
now
in
college
I
still
send
home
some
of
my
papers
for
critique.
They
understand
my
strengths
and
weaknesses
but
still
manage
to
provide
suggestions
for
further
improvement.
They,
like
many
of
my
teachers,
have
emphasized
strong
vocabulary
with
succinct
phrasing.
This
has
greatly
influenced
my
style
of
writing,
helping
me
express
what
I
wish
in
the
most
efficient
way
possible.
Theyeve
truly
taught
me
that
less
is
more
and
my
best
writing
reflects
this.
My
concise
writing
style
has
led
me
to
prefer
assignments
with
explicit
purposes
and
guidelines.
No
matter
how
creative
I
may
attempt
to
be,
Iem
still
a
linear
thinker
with
work
that
always
seems
to
be
analytical.
