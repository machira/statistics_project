August

1997
I
have
never
considered
myself
a
writer.
I
do
not
keep
journals
or
diaries.
My
experiments
with
poetry
are
disastrous,
and
my
only
creative
stories
consist
of
a
dusty
stack
of
returned
assignments
written
at
the
last
minute
with
the
thought
of
my
grade
as
their
only
inspiration.
However,
as
I
recognize
that
my
natural
talents
will
never
lead
me
to
be
a
great
American
author
of
fine
literature,
I
also
realize
that
I
am
at
least
an
average
writer
who
appreciates
the
constant
improvements
that
my
writing
style
has
benefited
from
over
the
years.
My
knowledge
of
writing
and
of
the
English
language
has
increased
exponentially
with
experience
gained
from
changes
in
types
of
assignments,
format
of
finished
products,
and
increased
expectations
of
quantity
and
quality
of
the
final
draft.
My
first
memory
of
writing
is
copying
sentences
into
workbooks
to
practice
my
handwriting.
My
sloppy
reproductions
of
"See
Dick
run"
did
not
require
much
thought,
however.
The
first
real
writing
assignment
that
I
vividly
remember
is
a
research
project
in
the
first
grade
on
the
state
of
Oregon.
All
of
my
research
came
from
the
World
Book
Encyclopedia,
but
I
remember
having
to
copy
several
drafts
before
being
satisfied
enough
with
the
quality
of
my
penmanship
to
turn
it
in.
I
think
this
is
when
I
began
hating
the
performance
of
pen.
Pen
leaves
no
room
for
mistakes.
Despite
my
teachers
orders,
I
used
pencil
whenever
possible
and
prefer
pencil
over
anything
except
a
word
processor
even
today.
After
a
couple
years
of
mostly
summary
based
research
projects,
creative
writing
assignments
occupied
most
of
my
time.
In
the
third
and
fourth
grades,
a
common
assignment
would
start
with
a
prompt
of
two
or
three
sentences.
An
example
response
would
be
given
along
with
the
strict
instructions
of
following
the
"proper"
writing
format:
brainstorming
or
prewriting,
outline,
rough
draft,
and
a
final
copy
in
ink.
Each
step
would
be
turned
in
separately.
I
was
graded
on
a
scale
of
zero
to
four
with
an
A
being
a
four.
Description,
varied
vocabulary,
and
creative
story
lines
determined
my
score.
Grammar
mistakes
were
corrected
but
not
counted
against
me.
Even
at
this
early
stage
of
my
writing
development,
I
received
consistent
fours
on
my
papers
and
felt
a
sense
of
accomplishment
when
my
work
was
praised
or
used
as
an
example
for
other
students.
My
writing
continued
to
receive
high
marks
and
enthusiastic
compliments
from
teachers
until
I
hit
an
unexpected
brick
wall
at
the
end
of
middle
school.
Eighth
grade
marked
my
first
year
in
a
new
school
district.
Initially,
everything
went
well.
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
placed
into
the
highest
level
classes
and
do
well.
English
quickly
became
a
problem,
however.
The
straight
A's
and
bubbling
praise
from
teachers
that
I
had
received
in
the
past
were
absent.
Instead,
I
received
comments
like,
"See
me
for
help,"
or
Good
ideas,
but
organization
needs
some
work."
I
was
very
discouraged.
My
first
quarter
grade
in
English
was
the
first
and
only
C
that
I
have
ever
received
on
a
report
card.
Before
this
period
of
my
life,
I
hadn't
been
exposed
to
many
textbook
grammar
rules.
I
knew
conversational
grammatical
conventions,
but
gerunds,
clauses,
phrases,
and
types
of
sentence
structure
were
foreign
to
me.
These
eight
and
ninth
grade
honor
level
English
classes
challenged
me
and
frustrated
me
at
the
same
time.
I
felt
as
if
all
of
the
students
knew
more
than
I
did.
Luckily,
my
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Gardetto,
offered
to
help
me
after
school.
She
taught
me
grammar
basics
and
introduced
me
to
what
I
consider
college
level
academic
writing.
The
most
important
developments
of
my
writing
history
happened
during
these
years.
In
addition
to
learning
the
mechanics
of
writing,
I
learned
what
mistakes
to
look
for
in
my
papers
by
peer
editing
other
student's
papers.
Weekly
timed
writing
assignments
also
helped
by
forcing
me
to
organize
my
thoughts
and
have
a
mental
outline
of
the
major
points
I
wanted
to
make
in
an
essay.
Most
of
the
written
assignments
created
in
this
class
were
responses
to
literary
material:
novels,
short
stories,
or
poems.
The
subject
of
the
papers
did
not
really
matter,
however.
What
was
important
was
that
this
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
I
began
to
analyze
and
thoroughly
edit
my
writing.
In
addition
to
English
papers,
I
also
remember
extensive
writing
projects
in
my
Geography
and
public
speaking
classes.
I
had
to
write
a
twenty
page
research
paper
on
the
country
of
Turkey.
Since
my
Aunt
Tiernan
lived
in
Turkey
at
the
time,
my
report
included
photographs,
postcards,
lira,
and
common
items
such
as
Frito-Lay
potato
chip
bags
written
in
Turkish.
I
was
very
proud
of
my
finished
paper.
Since
I
had
just
become
familiar
with
my
family's
new
computer,
I
enjoyed
writing
my
paper
from
start
to
finish
in
WordPerfect.
Word
processing
without
an
initial
outline
was
a
different
style
of
writing
to
get
used
to;
there
were
no
messy
drafts
to
be
rewritten
into
final
drafts
in
permanent
ink.
Never
again
would
I
voluntarily
write
a
paper
of
any
length
without
a
computer.
Writing
speeches
for
my
public
speaking
class
was
also
a
learning
experience.
Written
work
that
is
to
be
presented
orally
has
unique
parameters.
Long,
sometimes
confusing
sentences
that
could
be
read
a
couple
of
times
in
print
must
be
rewritten
into
short
thoughts
that
flow
together
in
a
pleasing
rhythm
of
speech.
It
was
in
this
class
that
I
learned
the
importance
of
capturing
an
audience's
attention
with
an
alluring
opening.
This
is
important
not
only
in
speeches
but
in
essays
as
well.
In
tenth
and
eleventh
grades,
the
major
projects
revolved
around
critiquing
literature.
I
read
Alice
Walkers
The
Color
Purple
in
tenth
grade.
After
forming
my
own
opinions
on
the
novel
into
a
thesis
statement,
I
had
to
use
contemporary
literary
criticisms
from
professional
critics
to
support
my
argument.
This
combination
of
research
and
argument
made
me
eager
to
work
on
this
project.
During
my
junior
year,
I
wrote
an
extensive
research
paper
explaining
the
importance
of
The
Diary
of
Samuel
Peeps.
It
was
a
long
and
boring
undertaking
and
at
the
conclusion
of
my
project,
I
decided
that
there
was
nothing
of
interest
or
importance
to
me
in
the
diary
at
all.
My
lack
of
enthusiasm
for
the
paper
must
have
been
apparent
in
my
writing;
although,
my
teacher
was
generous
and
gave
me
an
A-.
Another
important
step
in
my
development
as
a
writer
came
when
I
was
asked
as
an
intern
at
the
United
States
Army
Medical
Research
Institute
of
Infectious
Diseases
(USAMRIID)
to
write
a
scientific
paper
explaining
my
summer
project.
It
was
the
summer
after
my
senior
year
of
high
school,
and
occasional
lab
reports
were
my
only
experience
with
scientific
papers.
I
was
worried
that
I
wouldn't
be
able
to
sound
intelligent
while
using
scientific
jargon.
My
project
involved
pneumonic
plague,
so
my
first
step
was
to
research
articles
on
other
research
projects
involving
plague.
I
studied
the
professional
scientists'
formats
in
their
published
articles
and
quickly
noticed
a
pattern.
I
surprised
myself
as
I
wrote
my
own
paper
by
mimicking
their
style.
It
proved
to
be
an
effective
learning
method
and
my
mentor
was
pleased
with
the
final
product.
By
the
time
I
sat
in
Chemistry
and
Art,
my
first
year
seminar
class
at
Lafayette,
I
felt
adequately
prepared
for
college
writing.
Our
papers
consisted
of
research
projects,
lab
reports,
and
supporting
persuasive
arguments.
Although
I
gained
more
writing
experience,
my
first
college
level
writing
class
did
not
provide
much
of
a
challenge.
English
116
was
not
much
more
difficult.
The
amount
of
writing
required
was
extensive
and
the
topics
more
thought
provoking
than
in
the
past,
but
no
significant
changes
in
my
writing
style
were
apparent
to
me.
Since
I
am
majoring
in
chemical
engineering
at
Lafayette
College,
I
will
probably
be
unable
to
continue
with
any
other
English
courses.
In
the
absence
of
a
structured
English
class,
I
hope
that
my
experiences
as
a
writing
associate
will
enable
me
to
sustain
the
writing
abilities
I
have
acquired
to
date.
Although
I
do
not
aspire
to
become
a
professional
author,
my
encounters
with
writing
have
allowed
me
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
need
for
the
professional
application
of
academic
writing
in
college
and
in
society.
