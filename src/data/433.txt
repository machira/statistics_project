Writing
My
Life
My
first
act
of
NwritingO
took
place
at
age
four.
My
mother,
whom
I
suppose
I
was
living
with
during
this
time,
had
recently
given
away
a
puppy,
Casey,
whom
I
was
terrified
of.
The
dog
would
tear
around
our
house,
barking
and
generally
making
as
much
commotion
as
possible;
I
would
cower
in
fear
on
the
couch.
A
few
weeks
after
she
had
given
the
dog
away,
she
saw
me
crouched
very
intently
over
a
piece
of
paper
lying
on
the
floor,
pencil
in
hand.
Assuming
I
was
practicing
writing
random
letters,
as
I
tended
to
do,
she
didnOt
think
to
ask
me
what
I
was
doing
at
first.
When
she
finally
did,
I
told
her
very
matter-of-factly
that
I
was
writing
a
letter
to
Casey.
When
she
looked
at
what
I
had
written,
she
knew
that,
as
she
put
it,
Nshe
was
in
real
trouble.O
I
recently
got
the
chance
to
see
a
copy
of
that
letter;
my
mom
had
saved
it,
and
dragged
it
out
a
few
weeks
ago
when
I
asked
her
about
any
Nearly
writing
experiencesO
she
might
remember.
There
were
about
four
vowels
in
the
whole
letter,
and
IOm
fairly
sure
that
three
of
them
were
the
word
NI.O
There
werenOt
any
spaces
between
words
or
sentences,
all
of
the
letters
were
capitalized,
and
there
was
absolutely
no
use
of
punctuation
whatsoever.
In
fact,
you
can
hardly
call
it
writing
at
all.
Even
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
my
letter
to
Casey
was
a
very
important
moment
in
my
development
as
a
writer,
even
though
it
barely
counts
as
a
piece
of
writing.
Thinking
about
this,
I
realized
that
some
of
the
most
important
events
leading
me
to
become
the
writer
I
am
today
did
not
directly
involve
my
writing
at
all.
The
story
of
the
writer
I
am
today
began,
in
actuality,
with
my
parents.
My
father
was
and
is
a
writer
and
a
poet;
my
mother,
an
artist.
They
are
both
intensely
intelligent
people,
and,
left
to
their
own
devices,
would
have
become
dreamers,
visionaries,
and
the
like.
An
ideal
family
for
any
creative-minded
child
to
grow
up
in,
perhaps.
Personally,
I
donOt
remember
them
together,
as
they
got
divorced
almost
immediately
after
I
was
born.
Throughout
my
life,
up
to
and
including
the
day
I
turned
eighteen,
they
have
constantly
been
at
each
otherOs
throats,
seeking
custody
and
child
support
and
vengeance
for
wrongs
remembered
or
imagined.
They
both
abandoned
their
more
artistic
pursuits
in
order
to
support
a
family,
my
father
remarrying
a
woman
who
stopped
working
after
she
became
pregnant,
and
my
mother
remarrying
a
man
who
she
then
supported
through
college.
I
bounced
from
household
to
household,
joining
in
on
the
trials
and
accusations
once
I
was
old
enough.
Through
all
of
this,
though,
my
parents
both
loved
me,
and
they
both
loved
to
read,
and
they
both
shared
this
love
with
me.
I
cannot
remember
a
time
when
I
did
not
have
a
book
I
was
reading.
To
this
day,
IOll
reread
books
IOve
read
fifty
times
rather
than
not
have
one
to
reach
for
at
night,
or
when
I
have
a
few
minutes
I
need
to
burn,
or
to
take
with
me
on
trips.
Since
before
I
moved
in
with
my
father
for
the
last
time
at
age
thirteen,
he
has
given
me
books
to
read
from
his
immense
personal
library
of
old
paperbacks.
The
point
is,
I
have
been
reading
and
hearing
stories
for
my
entire
life.
Along
with
stories,
another
constant
in
my
life
has
been
change.
My
parents
have
five
marriages
between
them,
and
I
was
around
for
all
of
them.
In
addition,
they
both
moved
around
frequently,
living
in
Florida,
New
Jersey,
Minnesota,
and
in
many
different
areas
of
Pennsylvania.
Coupled
with
changes
from
private
to
public
to
Catholic
schools,
as
well
as
summer
visitations
and
restraining
orders,
bouncing
around
from
parent
to
parent
and
state
to
state
gave
me
a
lot
of
different
places
to
try
and
call
home.
In
regards
to
my
development
as
a
writer,
the
changes
in
my
scholastic
situation
are
particularly
interesting.
During
one
of
the
most
stable
parts
of
my
life,
from
the
second
half
of
kindergarten
until
the
end
of
seventh
grade,
I
lived
with
my
mother
in
Orange
Park,
Florida.
Before
that,
I
lived
in
many
different
small
apartments
with
my
father,
who
was,
at
the
time,
struggling
to
keep
his
head
above
water
with
mounting
legal
costs
incurring
ever
larger
amounts
of
debt.
I
suppose
I
must
have
lived
with
my
mother
for
a
brief
span
during
this
time,
during
which
I
wrote
my
letter
to
Casey.
In
any
case,
after
being
taken
out
of
my
Catholic
kindergarten
in
New
Jersey,
my
mother
arranged
for
me
to
attend
a
small
private
K-12
school,
St.
JohnOs
Country
Day
School.
Looking
back
on
my
time
there,
I
realize
that
it
was
an
incredible
school,
and
I
regret
that
I
didnOt
appreciate
it
more
while
I
was
there.
After
7th
grade,
custody
battles
flared
again
and
I
ended
up
at
Pottstown
Middle
School
for
an
eye-opening
year.
Pottstown
is
not
a
very
wealthy
area,
so
the
public
schools
are
not
exactly
of
the
highest
caliber.
The
change
was
pretty
startling
for
me
for
other
reasons,
as
well,
since
I
had
to
try
and
make
new
friends
and
get
used
to
the
way
things
were
around
my
dadOs
house.
I
found
myself
taking
courses
that
covered
material
I
had
learned
a
year
or
two
ago,
and
dealing
with
things
IOd
not
had
to
deal
with
at
St.
JohnOs.
Drug
use
and
drinking
werenOt
really
things
that
IOd
dealt
with
before,
and
now
many
of
the
kids
around
me
were
involved.
This
lasted
for
a
year,
after
which
I
changed
schools
again,
this
time
going
to
a
Catholic
school,
St.
Pius
X
High
School.
My
experiences
at
Pius
included,
among
other
things,
my
first
real
challenge
as
a
writer.
The
curriculum
was
somewhat
more
involved,
but
I
still
found
that
St.
JohnOs
had
taught
me
much
of
what
I
was
supposed
to
be
learning
in
class.
The
writing
assignments,
while
they
were
more
involved
than
most
IOd
had
before,
were
still
fairly
straightforward
reports
and
the
like.
The
challenge
came
when
I
joined
the
debate
team
my
sophomore
year,
at
the
behest
of
my
father.
It
was
here
that
I
first
really
thought
about
writing
as
something
that
I
could
do,
aside
from
book
reports
and
presentations
on
the
anatomy
of
a
cell.
Now,
while
I
did
not
participate
in
the
speech
events,
which
would
have
involved
more
traditional
writing,
the
debate
events
alone
still
presented
an
interesting
challenge.
I
had
to
prepare
some
statements
beforehand,
and
also
prepare
arguments
for
any
points
my
opponent
brought
against
my
argument.
More
than
simply
writing
and
later
repeating
what
IOd
written,
however,
the
debate
itself
was
a
dynamic
process,
where
I
would
have
to,
in
essence,
write
a
response
to
my
opponent
in
the
short
time
that
he
was
speaking.
More
than
the
actual
writing
in
the
sense
of
putting
words
on
paper,
I
was
effectively
NwritingO
much
of
my
argument
as
I
was
talking.
I
did
very
well,
winning
first
place
in
a
competition
my
first
year
there,
and
fairly
consistently
landing
in
the
top
five.
My
time
on
the
debate
team
marked,
to
me,
the
first
of
my
accomplishments
as
a
writer.
After
two
years
at
Pius,
I
was
put
back
in
the
public
school
system
at
Pottstown
High
School,
where
I
found
a
new
group
of
people
I
didnOt
know,
since
my
last
time
with
them
had
been
a
short
year
back
in
8th
grade
in
which
I
had
struggled
with
shyness
and
anxiety
about
my
family.
In
any
case,
this
was
the
time
I
began
to
notice
that
the
teachers
were
complimenting
me
on
my
writing,
and
also
the
time
in
which
I
began
to
write
on
my
own.
It
was
also
during
my
time
at
Pottstown
that
I
was
commended
for
my
writing
abilities
through
awards
and
other
forms
of
recognition.
It
was
during
this
time
that
I
really
began
to
think
of
myself
as
a
writer,
even
though
I
tended
to
be
extremely
shy
about
who
I
shared
that
particular
view
of
myself
with.
Before
talking
about
outside
recognition,
IOd
like
to
say
a
few
things
about
how
I
viewed
my
own
writing.
I
didnOt
like
it
very
much.
I
never
really
felt
that
IOd
written
anything
that
impressive
or
insightful
or
really
worthwhile.
I
could
never
bring
myself
to
write
the
all-too-common
teenage
angst-ridden
poetry
in
which
so
many
of
my
friends
indulged
themselves.
Even
though
I
had
my
own
run-ins
with
clinical
depression
and
teen
angst,
I
could
never
take
myself
seriously
enough
to
attempt
to
write
poetry.
I
wrote
a
small
number
of
short
stories
which
I
kept
to
myself,
too
embarrassed
to
show
anyone.
My
friends
would
share
their
poetry
and
other
writings
with
me,
whether
I
wanted
them
to
or
not,
in
many
cases,
but
I
could
never
get
up
the
courage
to
show
any
of
my
writing
to
anyone.
This
shyness
wasnOt
because
I
thought
I
was
a
bad
writer;
it
wasnOt
even
that
I
thought
my
friends
were
better
writers
than
I.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I
felt
at
the
time
that
the
writing
they
were
so
excited
about
showing
me
was
simply
terrible.
I
just
compared
my
writing
to
the
writing
of
my
heroes,
writers
like
Ray
Bradbury
and
George
Orwell,
rather
than
to
that
of
my
peers.
Because
of
this
shyness
about
my
writing,
I
never
wrote
for
the
school
newspaper,
literary
magazine,
or
yearbook.
As
far
as
outside
recognition
goes,
I
was
awarded
the
Writer
of
the
Year
award
for
an
essay
I
wrote
about
Thoreau
my
junior
year,
something
I
was
quite
proud
of;
interestingly
enough,
my
essay
criticized
Thoreau
for
going
as
far
as
saying,
NThat
government
is
best
which
governs
not
at
all.O
Aside
from
the
praise
I
received
from
teachers
concerning
my
writing,
I
didnOt
really
get
much
outside
acknowledgment
of
my
writing,
which
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
I
didnOt
share
it
with
anyone.
One
exception
to
this
was
my
score
of
800
on
the
SAT
verbal
section;
while
I
understand
that
there
are
problems
with
the
standardized
testing
system,
getting
a
perfect
score
on
the
verbal
section
made
me
feel
much
more
confident
about
my
writing,
no
matter
how
well
the
test
actually
gauges
oneOs
abilities.
After
graduating
with
flagging
grades
and
little
participation
in
extracurricular
activities,
I
managed
to
squeeze
my
way
into
Lafayette
College,
though
I
was
forced
to
go
to
relatives
for
loans
due
to
complications
involving
a
disagreement
between
my
parents
regarding
the
FAFSA.
I
had
been
wanting
to
get
to
college
ever
since
IOd
started
high
school,
and
I
was
a
little
surprised
that
IOd
finally
made
it.
Overall,
the
experience
was
incredible,
and,
while
there
were
of
course
some
problems,
I
feel
IOve
done
very
well;
many
of
my
family
members,
most
of
whom
were
disappointed
in
my
high
school
performance,
have
told
me
that
IOve
flourished
at
college,
and
I
have
to
agree
with
them.
A
lot
of
my
growth
as
a
writer
occurred
during
this
past
year,
and
IOve
started
to
receive
more
and
more
recognition
and
confidence
in
my
abilities.
I
think
that
the
most
helpful
thing
that
has
happened
over
the
past
year
is
that
IOve
developed
a
feeling
of
accomplishment
about
my
writing;
that
is,
I
feel
like
itOs
actually
worth
something.
IOve
felt
challenged
by
the
tasks
set
before
me
at
Lafayette,
and
IOve
succeeded.
This
sense
of
accomplishment
has
extended
beyond
simple
grades,
but
also
from
comments
made
by
professors
and
things
IOve
been
able
to
do
with
my
writing.
I
was
amazed
when
one
of
my
professors
asked
if
he
could
keep
my
final
paper
as
an
example.
I
was
happily
surprised
to
find
that
all
of
my
professors
responded
well
to
my
writing,
and
that
four
of
them
were
impressed
enough
to
provide
recommendations
for
me
when
I
was
applying
to
become
a
WA.
I
was
even
more
surprised
when
I
was
actually
accepted
into
the
program.
While
I
had
gotten
some
recognition
before
coming
to
Lafayette,
I
have
to
say
that
it
didnOt
mean
much
to
me:
I
wasnOt
suffering
from
the
delusion
that
being
acknowledged
for
writing
at
Pottstown
High
School
really
meant
anything;
those
rewards
and
comments
were
mostly
just
little
confidence
boosters
for
me.
The
accomplishments
IOve
made
and
recognition
IOve
received
at
Lafayette
seems
much
more
legitimate
to
me;
not
only
are
all
the
standards
much
higher,
but
also
the
people
that
have
been
giving
me
recognition
have
doctorates.
Regardless
of
whether
any
of
this
should
matter
to
me,
it
has
and
does
matter,
and
quite
a
bit.
I
feel
confident
of
my
abilities
as
a
writer
now,
and
now,
when
I
write
something
and
write
it
well,
I
can
feel
proud
of
it,
rather
than
feeling
like
I
was
being
presumptuous
for
trying
to
be
a
writer
when
IOm
just
some
punk
kid.
In
my
opinion,
my
first
year
at
Lafayette
affected
my
development
as
a
writer
mostly
by
making
me
believe
in
myself,
as
cliched
and
hackneyed
as
that
sounds.
ItOs
not
that
I
feel
that
my
writing
itself
hasnOt
improved
much;
quite
the
opposite,
actually.
Aside
from
the
effects
of
having
real
confidence
in
my
writing,
IOve
had
intelligent
discussions
with
some
of
the
professors
here
about
my
strengths
and
weaknesses
as
a
writer,
and
they
have
helped
immensely.
The
challenges
IOve
faced
have
forced
me
to
approach
my
writing
in
different
ways
and
made
me
push
myself
harder
than
IOve
had
to
in
the
past.
However,
I
feel
that
none
of
this
would
have
helped
me
anywhere
near
as
much
if
I
was
still
lacking
in
basic
confidence
in
myself.
Over
the
course
of
the
first
eighteen
or
so
years
of
my
life,
I
feel
that
IOve
seen
a
lot
of
things
from
a
lot
of
perspectives.
IOve
lived
in
different
places,
with
different
people,
in
different
financial,
emotional,
and
even
religious
situations.
A
prime
example
of
some
of
the
different
perspectives
IOve
benefitted
from
is
my
collection
of
friends;
my
friends
who
went
to
Pottstown
High
School
are
a
completely
different
group
of
people
than
my
new
friends
at
Lafayette.
IOve
also
been
reading
my
entire
life,
and
IOve
always
been
encouraged
in
my
creative
and
intellectual
development
by
my
parents,
no
matter
what
their
feelings
toward
each
other
have
been.
To
me,
it
feels
like
my
life
prepared
me
and
gave
me
the
tools
and
experiences
I
needed
to
be
a
good
writer,
and
my
experiences
at
Lafayette
have
prodded
me
into
realizing
my
potential.
IOve
done
more
writing
in
the
last
year
than
IOve
ever
done
in
my
life
before,
but
I
could
never
have
done
any
of
this
without
the
eighteen
years
of
preparation
I
had.
