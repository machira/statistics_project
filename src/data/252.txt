I
apologize
for
the
lateness
of
this
paper.
I
received
the
WA
packet
in
late
June,
but
at
that
time
I
was
unsure
of
my
academic
standing
with
the
school
and
thus
whether
this
assignment
applied
to
me
at
all.
I
hope
it
still
does.
-Patrick
Literary
Narrative
I
have
been
writing
for
a
long
time.
Mostly
I
attempt
to
emulate
the
various
styles
of
writers
I
admire.
I
do
not,
however,
agree
with
the
cliche
that
Shakespeare
has
fleshed
out
all
plots,
and
thus
there
is
no
originality
in
the
world.
Though
I
do
admire
The
Bard,
I
concur
with
Andre
Gidre's
statement:
"Everything
has
already
been
said,
but
since
nobody
was
listening,
we
have
to
start
again
That,
then,
is
the
point
of
my
creative
writing.
However,
the
other
type
is
more
in
my
realm
of
experience,
and
more
applicable
to
this
position.
In
creative
composition
one
is
free
to
bend
the
rules
of
the
language
and
to
throw
typical
organization
to
the
wind,
since
this
is
art
and
not
subject
to
mortal
rules.
I
often
struggle
with
that
freedom's
pervasive
influence
on
my
more
prosaic
writing;
often
I
find
myself
wrapped
up
in
the
joy
of
abstract
creation
and
drawn
away
from
clinical
nature
of
academic
construction.
This,
then,
should
be
an
interesting
hybrid
of
the
two
forms.
In
truth
I
cannot
recall
my
first
attempts
at
writing;
the
only
pieces
of
evidence
I
have
are
scraps
of
my
early
efforts,
texts
that
I
would
hesitate
to
name
"writing."
I
have
always
reserved
that
title
for
more
elegant
work,
and
thus
I
doubt
that
I
wrote
much
before
high
school.
For
the
sake
of
argument,
however,
here
is
a
brief
chronology
of
my
work
with
the
pen.
Much
of
this
has
been
pieced
together
with
the
help
of
older
family
members
who
remember
my
writing
with
perhaps
a
touch
of
revisionist
nostalgia,
so
I
cannot
say
how
accurate
the
early
chapters
of
this
tale
shall
be,
but
let
us
place
our
trust
in
their
wisdom
and
experience.
The
attempts
at
writing
I
produced
before
formal
education
were
typical
of
a
child;
large
confused
letters
written
in
crayon
on
brightly
colored
construction
paper,
mostly
copied
from
my
favorite
storybooks,
with
no
attempt
at
originality.
My
writing
continued
in
this
way
through
the
early
years
of
grade
school,
though
my
reading
level
was
always
three
or
four
years
ahead,
giving
me
a
broader
range
from
which
to
draw
my
imitations.
Unfortunately,
public
did
nothing
to
discourage
this
behavior,
being
more
concerned
with
the
poor
quality
of
my
handwriting.
It
was
about
this
time
that
my
parents
took
pity
on
my
poor
clumsy
hands
and
bought
me
a
computer
that
my
teachers
might
be
able
to
read
the
tripe
I
was
producing.
One
particularly
memorable
instance
of
public
school's
disinterest
in
my
ability
to
create
was
a
book
report
I
did
on
The
Phantom
Tollbooth
in
the
fourth
grade.
The
report
began
well
enough,
but
quickly
degenerated
into
a
summary
of
the
book,
until
by
the
end
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
paraphrasing
of
the
closing
sentences.
Despite
my
descent
into
outright
plagiarism,
I
received
an
A
on
my
report.
It
was
not
until
I
proudly
showed
the
report
to
my
parents
that
I
was
told
how
badly
I
had
erred.
From
then
on,
the
papers
I
did
for
school
lost
their
appeal.
I
found
that
no
matter
how
little
effort
I
put
into
those
papers,
I
still
received
excellent
marks,
which
only
served
to
further
my
cynical
attitude
toward
academic
writing.
In
frustration
I
turned
to
creative
composition,
creating
a
host
of
short
stories
and
even
a
few
poems,
though
I
struggled
with
the
latter
and
finally
abandoned
them,
returned
only
when
required
by
an
assignment
or
in
times
of
great
emotional
burden.
During
one
of
the
former
times
I
was
encouraged,
or
more
accurately
forced
into
submitting
a
poem
I
had
written
about
my
grandmother
to
the
school's
literary
publication.
To
my
horror,
it
was
accepted,
and
my
clumsy
attempts
at
poetry
are
forever
recorded
in
that
yellow
booklet.
Would
that
I
could
obliterate
all
copies
of
that
wretched
work
from
the
face
of
the
Earth
-
but
what
is
done
is
done.
It
was
during
this
time
that
I
turned
away
from
the
computer
as
a
means
of
composing
any
creative
work,
as
I
came
to
loathe
that
machine
as
a
symbol
of
staid
academia,
having
written
so
many
dull
papers
on
its
monochrome
monitor.
Even
today
I
remain
unable
to
create
on
a
computer;
I
must
write
my
outline
or
drafts
with
pen
and
paper.
Ironically,
that
less
rigid
form
falls
under
strict
restraint
in
my
own
mind.
While
I
can
compose
on
any
machine
in
any
program,
when
I
write
with
my
hand
and
not
my
fingers,
the
materials
must
conform
to
my
will.
I
must
have
a
thin,
smooth
black
pen
and
a
notebook
or
legal
pad.
I
am
incapable
of
writing
on
loose
leaf
or
with
any
color
but
black,
and
ballpoints
make
me
shudder.
Indeed,
in
preparing
this
paper
I
purchased
a
special
pen
with
which
to
write
the
crude
genesis,
and
upon
discovering
my
sister
had
misplaced
it,
I
flew
into
a
rage
and
was
unable
to
begin
until
I
had
found
a
suitable
replacement.
But
I
digress.
My
disgust
with
the
public
school's
indifference
toward
the
quality
of
written
work
came
to
a
head
in
the
eighth
grade.
I
was
given
an
assignment
so
dull
and
unimaginative
that
I
am
utterly
unable
to
recall
it.
Regardless,
I
decided
that
the
paper
was
a
waste
of
my
time,
and
I
did
not
turn
it
in.
I
expected
recrimination,
an
argument
in
which
I
could
make
my
displeasure
and
boredom
known.
What
I
got
instead
was
nothing.
No
reprisal,
no
adverse
effect
on
my
grades,
nothing.
I
received
an
A
in
the
class
for
the
term
and
no
comment
was
made
about
the
missing
paper.
It
was
a
good
thing,
then,
that
the
next
year
I
enrolled
in
a
private
high
school.
Though
my
grades
suffered
greatly
and
I
experienced
considerably
more
academic
rigor,
I
was
challenged
for
the
first
time
in
my
life.
From
ninth
grade
through
the
end
of
high
school
my
ability
to
write
was
tested
and
strengthened
through
exposure
to
harsher
critics
than
I
had
seen
in
my
earlier
years.
No
longer
did
I
feel
contempt
for
"staid"
academic
writing;
rather
I
found
that
I
could
inject
my
passion
into
that
calmer
form.
During
those
four
years
I
was
exposed
to
nearly
every
type
of
paper
imaginable,
though
I
sometimes
had
difficulty
in
applying
myself
to
the
task.
I
did
find,
however,
that
once
I
began
a
paper
I
would
slowly
gain
momentum,
reaching
the
end
in
a
frenzy
of
composition.
That
fit
of
passion
was
glorious
and
rewarding,
and
became
my
motivation
for
completing
the
assignments
I
sometimes
found
myself
loathe
to
begin.
My
high
school
writing
experience
culminated
in
my
senior
year
English
class,
which
was
an
AP
English
prep
course.
That
course
remains
the
toughest
experience
I've
had
in
my
trek
through
the
world
of
writing.
We
analyzed
dense
epics
such
as
Crime
And
Punishment
and
such
weighty
poems
as
Tennyson's
"The
Love
Song
Of
J.
Alfred
Prufrock".
At
the
end
of
that
time
I
took
not
one,
but
two
advanced
English
exams:
both
the
AP
and
the
International
Baccalaureate.
The
latter
was
the
test
that
mattered
more
to
those
of
us
who
took
both,
and
the
one
that
we
suffered
first.
Thus,
when
the
AP
came,
none
of
our
little
band
showed
much
interest
or
concern.
It
was
therefore
a
pleasant
surprise
when
my
score
came
back
a
five.
With
that
proud
accomplishment
in
my
belt
I
approached
college
writing
with
a
confident
swagger.
As
it
turned
out,
FYS
was
not
quite
the
cakewalk
I
thought
it
would
be.
Happily,
the
instructor
was
the
best
writer
I
have
ever
come
across
and
I
was
able
to
learn
more
from
him
than
from
any
instructor
before
or
since.
In
that
class
I
was
able
to
inject
even
more
passion
into
my
academic
writing
than
before.
Further,
I
was
allowed
to
choose
the
topics
of
my
papers,
and
thus
enjoy
the
writing
process.
Thanks
to
my
AP
scores
I
was
exempted
from
FYW,
and
so
I
did
not
write
again
for
an
entire
year
-
at
least
not
for
a
class.
During
that
year
I
amused
myself
by
reading
Lovecraft
and
Harlan
Ellison
and
creating
work
in
their
respective
styles
in
an
attempt
to
understand
the
profound
effect
of
their
work
on
my
own
style.
VAST
offered
me
an
interesting
change
from
the
writing
I
had
done
in
the
past,
since
I
had
rarely
tackled
technical
writing
until
that
time.
I
found
that
I
had
to
curb
my
passion
to
achieve
the
clarity
necessary
to
this
sort
of
writing,
but
I
allowed
myself
to
vent
that
unspent
vigor
in
further
creative
work,
and
so
nothing
was
lost.
Despite
this,
however,
I
still
prefer
the
marriage
of
passion
and
technique.
In
that
harmony
I
find
both
the
joy
of
creation
and
the
relief
of
freedom
from
commitment.
Again,
in
the
composition
of
this
paper,
I
was
clearly
delayed.
For
the
several
nights
before
I
was
able
to
begin
the
writing
I
was
haunted
by
dreams
of
guilt
that
the
work
remained
incomplete,
and
I
expect
that
when
the
envelope
enters
the
mail
slot
I
will
be
filled
with
a
sense
of
relief
as
profound
as
those
I
have
felt
with
the
successful
completion
of
the
dozens
of
papers
that
have
gone
before.
My
major
has
not
afforded
me
many
opportunities
to
work
with
the
words
I
so
enjoy
and
I
expect
the
same
shortcoming
of
my
future
career.
Still,
I
love
the
flow
of
ink
across
the
page,
and
my
self-indulgent
nature
will
have
me
penning
grandiose
conclusions
like
this
one
for
many
years
to
come.
I
find
that
to
be
the
signature
nature
of
my
work,
along
with
brevity
and
high-flung
language:
a
conclusion
that
streams
from
my
brain
at
breakneck
speed,
such
that
I
can
barely
reach
the
keys
or
move
the
pen
fast
enough
to
catch
it
before
the
moment
passes,
and
I
am
left
bereft
at
the
work's
ending
-
but
solace
will
come
with
the
next
book
I
read,
or
the
next
words
I
write.
