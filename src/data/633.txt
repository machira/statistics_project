One
of
the
great
things
about
college
is
that
it
is
a
time
when
you
are
always
growing,
developing,
and
changing.
Academically,
interactions
with
professors,
resources
and
other
students
help
you
gain
knowledge
and
skills,
learn
to
analyze
and
draw
conclusions,
and
make
decisions.
Personally,
you
face
challenges
everyday
that
you
learn
from
and
overcome.
You
are
immersed
in
an
environment
where
you
and
everyone
around
you
is
developing
an
identity
and
setting
themselves
up
to
start
life
as
prepared
as
possible.
It
is
a
challenging,
exciting
time
and
in
a
year,
a
lot
can
happen.
Looking
back
on
this
past
year,
I
see
that
becoming
a
WA
last
year
was
a
great
decision
for
me.
Among
all
of
the
personal
and
academic
obstacles
and
opportunities
of
the
past
year
is
woven
the
thread
of
my
writing,
and
it
is
fascinating
to
see
how
it
has
changed
over
the
past
year.
Fall
of
last
year
was
my
first
(and
only)
semester
as
a
WA
thus
far.
Although
we
were
given
a
comprehensive
orientation
session,
I
was
still
unsure
of
what
to
expect
and
how
to
interact
with
the
students.
However,
once
I
met
them,
I
realized
that
they
were
ten
times
more
scared
of
me
then
I
was
of
them!
Fresh
out
of
high
school,
they
didnOt
know
what
to
expect.
I
remembered
the
feeling
well
from
my
own
FYS
and
I
realized
that
the
most
important
thing
I
could
help
them
with
was
to
give
them
confidence
and
encouragement.
I
believe
that
I
am
a
fairly
competent
person,
both
generally
and
as
a
writer.
I
was
chosen
as
a
WA;
I
knew
that
I
was
qualified
and
capable.
My
first
obstacle
was
accepting
this
fact
D
I
wouldnOt
be
very
useful
in
inspiring
the
students
if
I
didnOt
have
any
confidence
in
myself.
Although
I
knew
that
my
writing
would
continue
to
grow
and
develop,
I
also
realized
that
I
did
have
enough
knowledge
and
experience
to
be
a
useful
resource
(and,
of
course,
I
had
St.
Martins
for
backup).
My
WA
experience
may
have
been
a
little
different
from
others,
because
my
students
had
only
one
large
paper
to
write
for
their
classes:
an
analysis
of
a
charismatic
person.
In
our
first
meetings,
I
talked
to
each
student
about
why
they
had
picked
the
person
they
picked.
I
was
surprised
at
the
enthusiasm
and
excitement
the
students
felt
for
their
topics.
One
student
had
personal
reasons
for
choosing
a
religious
figure,
while
another
international
student
chose
a
controversial
leader
from
his
home
country.
It
was
interesting
to
talk
to
the
students
and
really
understand
where
the
paper
was
coming
from
before
they
started
writing
it.
As
the
students
moved
through
their
drafts,
I
could
compare
each
personOs
writing
style
with
my
own.
Some
people
wrote
copious
amounts
of
notes,
outlines
and
drafts
before
they
were
happy,
while
others
came
in
with
vague
ideas
or
unorganized
paragraphs.
In
every
case,
I
was
able
to
be
an
objective
observer,
helping
them
to
get
their
thoughts
in
order
and
into
a
coherent
draft.
It
was
different
from
my
own
writing
experiences,
and
I
learned
a
lot
about
the
students
and
about
my
own
writing
style
from
it.
When
I
am
writing
myself,
I
am
not
objective
or
impartial
D
I
know
what
I
mean,
I
think
I
am
making
perfect
sense
even
when
I
am
not.
Most
of
the
students
I
was
mentoring
believed
similar
things
about
their
own
drafts.
Working
through
the
drafts
of
others
and
finding
the
gaps
and
faulty
connections,
I
learned
to
be
able
to
analyze
my
own
writing
more
objectively.
This
has
allowed
me
to
write
stronger
papers
and
also
refine
my
writing
process.
While
I
write,
I
am
more
careful
to
make
sure
everything
I
am
thinking
is
making
it
on
to
the
paper
and
everything
is
as
connected
and
supported
as
possible.
I
believe
that
oneOs
writing
is
closely
tied
in
with
who
they
are
as
a
person.
Although
it
is
influenced
by
things
we
see,
hear
and
read,
and
tempered
by
rules
and
structure,
everyone
has
a
unique
writing
style
in
the
same
way
everyone
has
a
unique
voice
or
a
unique
fingerprint.
Its
part
of
why
I
have
always
loved
reading
D
pick
up
a
book,
even
the
most
farfetched
fantasy
novel,
and
you
have
an
immediate,
intimate
connection
with
the
author.
It
never
ceases
to
amaze
me.
Working
with
other
students
on
their
writing
was
fun
and
challenging,
but
also
more
touching
then
I
expected
it
to
be.
Throughout
the
semester,
the
studentsO
drafts
improved
and
their
writing
grew
stronger,
while
they
settled
in
to
college
life
and
became
more
confident,
strong
people.
That
semester
was
not
an
intensive
writing
time
for
me.
However,
some
free
time
in
my
schedule
led
me
to
take
an
acting
class.
It
was
a
lot
of
fun,
but
it
also
showed
me
a
new
perspective
on
written
communication.
Acting
is
the
art
of
taking
someone
elseOs
written
work
and
translating
it
to
an
audience.
Capturing
the
authorOs
intent
and
meaning
is
the
basis
of
it,
but
a
truly
great
actor
must
also
capture
the
authorOs
tone,
that
unique
voice
that
makes
that
piece
different
then
any
other.
While
writing,
one
must
consider
the
audience
and
how
the
reader
will
interpret
the
writing.
Acting
out
the
words
of
others
made
me
think
more
about
how
someone
would
interpret
my
own
writing.
Not
that
I
imagine
someone
is
going
to
turn
my
treatise
on
the
perception
and
cognition
of
faces
into
a
dramatic
monologue,
but
that
didnOt
mean
I
shouldnOt
try
to
make
it
as
interesting
as
possible.
After
all,
there
are
many
ways
to
present
information,
and
the
more
interesting
it
is,
the
more
enjoyable
the
professor
will
find
it.
So
in
writing
I
began
to
keep
in
mind
someone
on
a
stage
reading
my
paper
D
would
the
audience
be
interested?
At
this
time
I
also
began
to
focus
more
on
my
resume.
The
people
at
career
services
assured
me
this
was
my
first,
last,
and
best
way
to
make
a
good
impression
on
potential
employers,
and
it
needed
to
convey
a
variety
of
things:
that
I
am
smart,
capable,
skilled,
dependable,
a
hard
worker,
and
perfect
for
the
position.
Every
word
had
to
be
perfect.
Obviously,
my
experience
and
the
things
I
have
done
are
what
would
make
me
a
good
candidate;
nevertheless
it
is
how
it
is
presented
that
would
make
sure
I
was
noticed
and
considered.
Writing
a
resume
is
a
writing
challenge
like
no
other,
and
while
I
am
still
working
on
it
I
know
being
a
WA
has
helped
me
to
make
as
good
a
page
as
I
can.
During
my
second
semester,
I
decided
to
challenge
myself
both
academically
and
personally
by
studying
abroad.
After
a
lot
of
careful
thought,
I
embarked
on
a
journey
to
live
and
study
in
Galway,
Ireland.
Learning
to
live
in
a
different
country
with
an
entirely
culture
took
huge
adjustments
and
open-mindedness.
The
food,
the
people,
even
the
air
smelled
differently
there.
The
first
thing
I
noticed
about
my
fellow
Irish
students
was
that
I
couldnOt
understand
a
word
they
said!
Deciding
to
study
in
Ireland
had
been
the
product
of
many
factors,
but
one
of
them
had
been
making
sure
I
ended
up
in
an
English-speaking
country.
However,
once
I
got
there
there
were
so
many
differences
in
language
I
felt
like
it
was
a
whole
different
tongue.
It
took
a
while
for
me
to
adjust
to
their
colloquialisms
and
turns
of
speech
(and
accents!).
Upon
arriving
in
Ireland
for
orientation,
we
were
bombarded
with
papers
D
instructions,
contracts,
newsletters
and
so
on.
The
subtle
different-ness
that
permeated
everything
was
in
the
writing
I
received,
and
while
I
canOt
exactly
describe
what
it
was,
it
definitely
portended
a
new
environment
for
my
writing
to
encounter.
My
first
writing
challenge
was
part
of
a
botany
class,
and
it
showed
me
some
of
the
differences
between
the
kind
of
writing
expected
from
college
students
in
America
and
Ireland.
I
had
to
learn
a
whole
new
style
of
formatting
(Harvard).
The
first
question
was:
NWhat
is
the
Harvard
referencing
system?O
This
seemed
like
a
strange
question
for
a
second
year
class.
Apparently,
in
Ireland
students
focus
entirely
on
one
specific
subject,
and
do
not
learn
any
more
than
the
basics
of
what
in
America
is
considered
fundamental
knowledge.
Unless
a
student
is
studying
English
or
communications,
writing
is
not
considered
as
important.
Suddenly
I
was
very
appreciative
of
my
liberal
arts
education,
the
attention
to
writing
my
teachers
paid
in
high
school
and
college,
and
the
opportunity
to
be
a
WA
and
work
with
others
to
help
them
to
appreciate
how
important
good
writing
is
to
succeeding
in
school
and
in
life.
The
Irish
system
is
set
up
so
the
majority
of
the
grade
for
a
class
(if
not
the
entire
thing)
is
based
off
an
essay-style
examination
at
the
end
of
the
course.
During
the
semester,
the
students
are
mainly
responsible
for
attending
classes
and
doing
outside
reading.
Most
of
the
time,
the
final
exam
questions
were
known
ahead
of
time.
Success
in
the
course
relied
not
only
on
knowing
the
appropriate
facts,
but
also
being
able
to
present
them
in
a
cohesive
essay
with
a
clear
argument
and
a
logical
structure.
In
most
of
my
classes,
I
was
going
into
the
exams
with
no
knowledge
of
what
was
expected
and
no
idea
how
the
Irish
students
dealt
with
them.
However,
I
felt
confident
that
my
writing
skills
were
strong
and
I
knew
the
facts
I
needed
to
know.
Therefore,
I
didnOt
worry
too
much
about
how
it
would
compare
to
the
Irish
students,
and
I
focused
on
writing
a
good
essay
and
am
pleased
with
how
it
turned
out.
Studying
abroad
was
one
of
the
most
challenging
and
exciting
times
in
my
life,
and
I
know
I
grew
and
changed
as
a
result
of
it.
The
best
way
to
grow
in
anything
is
to
go
out
and
expose
yourself
to
new
and
different
things
and
situations,
and
get
new
ideas
in
your
head.
Complacency
will
only
lead
to
inertia,
and
living
and
learning
and
writing
in
Ireland
was
a
good
way
for
me
to
both
challenge
myself
and
gain
more
appreciation
for
the
skills
I
have
been
taught
and
achieved
through
experience.
As
I
am
now
going
in
to
my
senior
year,
my
thinking
about
writing
is
changing
a
little
bit.
Previously,
I
have
always
thought
about
writing
successfully
in
an
academic
setting
and
writing
a
good
paper.
Now,
however,
I
find
myself
thinking
more
about
what
it
is
I
am
actually
saying,
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
writing,
the
audience,
and
how
the
writing
is
a
reflection
of
myself.
Instead
of
it
being
a
NgoodO
paper,
I
am
now
trying
to
make
it
a
paper
that
shows
the
reader
what
and
how
I
think.
In
the
fall
I
will
begin
doing
my
thesis,
a
project
that
will
definitely
require
a
great
deal
of
writing.
While
in
the
past
I
have
written
a
variety
of
different
kinds
of
work,
this
will
probably
be
the
most
intense
and
extensive
undertaking
thus
far.
In
this
case,
I
think
that
I
am
very
lucky
to
have
had
the
WA
experience
that
I
had,
working
with
students
through
a
semester-long
process
of
writing
a
paper.
As
my
own
work
will
go
through
multiple
stages
and
drafts,
I
can
take
what
I
learned
from
working
with
them
and
apply
it
to
my
own
works.
Another
major
factor
this
semester
will
be
my
applying
to
graduate
schools.
Once
again,
I
have
a
variety
of
written
mediums
to
show
a
committee
that
I
am
a
good
scholar
and
a
good
fit
for
their
program.
In
a
short
essay,
I
will
have
to
clearly
and
eloquently
express
my
life,
my
experiences,
my
characteristics,
my
strengths,
and
my
hopes
and
dreams
for
the
future.
Strong
writing
is
the
best
tool
I
have
in
doing
this
in
such
a
way
that
I
can
achieve
my
dreams.
This
past
year
I
have
experienced
a
lot
of
different
things
and
have
grown
as
a
person
and
as
a
writer.
I
have
learned
to
reach
further
into
myself
and
make
sure
each
word
is
my
own.
I
have
also
learned
to
think
more
about
the
reader
and
how
my
words
will
be
interpreted.
I
also
learned
a
lot
from
working
with
the
students
last
semester
and
I
am
really
excited
to
work
with
and
learn
from
a
new
group
of
students
in
the
fall.
I
find
it
to
be
very
meaningful
work
to
help
someone
grow
and
develop
and
find
their
own
tone
and
their
own
voice,
and
I
know
that
itOs
something
that
they
will
use
from
that
day
out.
I
feel
very
lucky
to
have
had
the
opportunities
and
education
I
have
had.
Hopefully
this
coming
year
will
be
as
challenging
and
rewarding
as
the
past
year
has
been
for
me.
