Writing
as
a
WA
Fall
2006
Appendix
A
-
There
is
always
a
bit
of
fiction
in
a
narrative.
Our
memories
are
structured
in
narrative
form
and
are
necessarily
limited
and
inaccurate.
To
attempt
to
take
those
recollections
and
further
refine
them
into
a
tangible,
written
product
assures
that
more
than
a
bit
of
truth
is
lost.
I
mention
this
because,
as
I
considered
my
history
as
a
writer
since
last
August,
I
realized
that
I
am
not
entirely
sure
of
how
I
came
to
the
point
where
I
am
now
from
where
I
was
twelve
months
ago.
My
development
as
a
writer
is
and
always
has
been
subtle.
I
find
most
change
occurs
without
a
conscious
realization
that
it
is
occurring
at
all.
That
said,
this
addendum
to
my
literacy
history
is
more
a
retroactive
assemblage
of
memories
that
I
believe
to
have
had
notable
impact
on
the
way
in
which
I
create,
review
and
think
about
writing
D
even
if
I
do
not
understand
what
the
impact
has
been,
far
less
am
able
to
express
it
verbally.
One
thing
of
which
I
am
sure
is
that
I
have
undergone
changes
as
a
writer
and
a
reader;
I
can
offer
below
only
an
imperfect
attempt
at
explaining
how
those
changes
may
or
may
not
have
come
about.
The
major
developments
of
my
literacy
history
in
the
past
year
stemmed
from
two
experiences:
my
introduction
to
the
WA
staff
in
the
fall
of
2005
and
my
semester
studying
abroad
in
Dublin
in
the
spring
of
2006.
The
former
had
a
greater
immediate
conscious
impact
on
my
life
as
a
writer
and,
in
part,
defined
how
I
reacted
to
academic
life
in
Ireland
with
my
own
writing
and
as
a
reader
of
othersO
work.
As
I
began
working
as
a
Writing
Associate,
I
was
aware
that
I
was
making
my
first
real
effort
to
consider
explicitly
the
writing
process
in
general
and
my
approach
to
it
in
particular.
Previously,
writing
was
an
act
that
I
carried
out
without
paying
mind
to
how
I
did
it.
Although
I
considered
traditional
concerns
such
as
clarity,
thesis
and
structure
when
I
revised,
I
did
not
think
of
them
in
such
outright
terms
and
evaluated
my
writing
on
two
childish-sounding
terms:
did
it
Nmake
senseO
and
did
it
Nsound
good.O
To
be
able
to
have
useful
conversations
with
students
during
conferences
required
that
I
first
take
a
step
back
to
gain
personal
perspective
upon
this
principal
method
of
academic
communication,
writing.
Doing
so
was
more
difficult
than
I
had
imagined
it
would
be.
Despite
the
thought
that
I
had
given
to
my
own
writing
prior
to
my
pioneer
round
of
conferences,
I
could
not
help
but
feel
unprepared
as
I
first
sat
down
next
to
a
student
in
Pardee
319.
I
had
little
idea
how
to
carry
on
a
dialogue
that
would
let
students
know
how
our
relationship
was
intended
to
function.
I
was
new
to
the
job
and
they
were
new
to
undergraduate
coursework
and
there
was,
unfortunately,
a
palpable
uncertainty
as
to
what
either
of
us
was
actually
supposed
to
do.
I
had
read
the
WA
handbook
and
attended
the
orientation
conference
and
staff
meetings,
but
putting
the
idea
of
acting
as
an
Ninformed
readerO
into
practice
was
another
matter.
It
was
difficult,
at
first,
to
offer
advice
without
it
being
perceived
as
directives.
I
was
so
eager
to
make
clear
that
I
was
a
peer
and
not
a
Teaching
Assistant
with
the
power
to
affect
studentsO
grades
that
I
came
across
as
timid
and
indecisive.
It
did
not
help
matters
that
most
students
held
an
initial
mentality
that
my
input
was
assignment-specific,
that
my
comments
were
meant
to
tidy
up
their
work
so
that
their
professor
would
be
satisfied
with
the
paper
at
hand.
After
I
had
met
with
two
thirds
of
the
class
to
which
I
was
assigned,
I
had
somewhat
of
a
breakthrough
conference
that
helped
me
develop
an
approach
that
proved
useful
on
both
sides
of
the
conference
table.
By
prompting
a
student
to
talk
at
length
about
the
argument
that
he
was
trying
articulate
in
his
paper,
he
was
able
to
characterize
his
thesis
in
a
concise
and
practical
manner;
he
was
able
to
verbally
clarify
the
implicit
connections
that
he
had
made
in
his
draft
and
talk
out
an
approach
he
might
use
to
refine
them
into
a
cohesive
line
of
reasoning.
Conversation
was
what
lay
at
the
real
heart
of
the
matter.
It
would
be
counterproductive
to
assume
that
that
one
successful
conference
could
then
serve
as
a
template
for
all
future
meetings,
but
the
experience
aided
me
in
finding
a
useful
tone
for
the
relationship
between
WA
and
fellow
writer.
It
was
more
important
to
assist
students
in
seeing
their
own
writing
D
a
particular
example
of
their
work
that
was
representative
of
their
general
approach
D
in
a
different
way
than
it
was
to
tell
them
how
I
thought
they
might
go
about
altering
their
papers
on
a
micro
level.
A
complication
arose
midway
through
the
semester
that
threatened
the
new
rapport
that
was
developing
with
many
of
the
students
with
whom
I
met.
Their
professor
instituted
a
new
policy:
students
had
to
submit
a
sheet
with
the
final
drafts
of
their
papers
that
outlined
how
they
had
addressed
all
of
the
points
that
I
had
raised
with
them
during
conferences.
The
new
measure
seemed
contrary
to
the
whole
premise
of
peer
review;
mandatory
changes
along
the
lines
of
every
suggestion
that
I
made
offset
the
balance
of
power
between
reader
and
writer
(not
to
mention
the
fact
that
conferences
are
almost
exclusively
oral
D
any
notes
that
I
jotted
down
on
studentsO
papers
were
more
to
jog
my
memory
of
their
work
than
to
give
them
a
checklist
of
corrections
to
make).
I
scheduled
a
meeting
with
the
professor
to
discuss
the
disconcerting
policy
and
learned
that
he
found
some
students
were
making
no
revisions
beyond
a
surface-level
proofreading
of
their
work
before
handing
in
final
drafts
of
their
papers.
He
hoped
that
a
requirement
to
produce
an
inventory
of
revisions
made
between
draft
and
final
product
would
motivate
students
to
take
a
harder
look
at
their
work
and
make
more
significant
changes.
We
agreed
that
the
theory
was
not
necessarily
counterproductive,
but
that
it
might
be
better
to
ask
students
to
catalogue
the
major
points
of
their
revision
process
and
briefly
note
what
they
hoped
their
changes
would
accomplish,
rather
than
to
require
them
to
address
every
specific
point
that
I
raised.
As
I
mentioned
above,
I
cannot
be
sure
how
my
realization
of
what
could
lead
to
a
successful
peer
review
session
affected
my
own
writing.
I
am
not
a
particularly
organized
thinker
and
when
writing,
reading
and
revising
my
work
I
think
I
had
never
taken
mindful
steps
to
address
a
set
checklist
of
the
important
components
of
an
academic
paper.
Even
during
and
after
my
role
as
a
WA
I
failed
to
consciously
run
through
a
set
list
of
terms
and
concerns.
In
retrospect,
though,
I
was
rereading
and
revising
with
a
more
intense
focus
on
how
my
audience
might
interpret
and
understand
that
which
I
had
written.
A
contributing
factor
was
the
increased
volume
of
writing
that
I
was
required
to
produce
at
Lafayette
during
the
Fall
2005
term.
The
assignments
themselves
were
not
more
difficult
so
much
as
they
were
more
involved;
to
make
certain
that
I
was
writing
effectively
required
extensive
rereading
and
focus
upon
my
central
argument,
organization,
my
presentation
of
evidence,
and
on
and
on.
As
irresponsible
as
it
may
sound,
my
increased
diligence
in
revision
and
attempts
to
see
my
writing
as
others
saw
it
was
far
less
a
conscious
extension
of
Npracticing
what
I
preachedO
in
the
WA
room
than
it
was
an
inevitable
result
of
having
extensive
conversations
with
so
many
different
writers
about
revision
methods.
Sheer
practicality
aside,
working
as
a
Writing
Associate
had
other
noticeable
impacts
upon
my
personal
approach
to
writing.
Although
my
high
school
English
teachers
had
occasionally
mandated
peer
NrevisionO
exercises,
the
amount
of
exposure
that
I
had
had
to
my
peersO
writing
was
certainly
less
than
it
could
and
perhaps
should
have
been.
In
the
event
that
I
did
read
fellow
studentsO
writing,
it
was
on
a
sporadic
basis
and
each
instance
was
almost
always
a
different
school
assignment
or
personal
project.
As
a
WA
I
had
the
opportunity
to
see
how
fifteen
individuals
tackled
the
same
assignment.
The
variety
of
styles
and
approaches
that
I
saw
was
of
keen
interest
to
me.
My
own
writing
tends
to
be
overly
formal,
wordy,
dry,
boringE
a
number
of
students
whose
papers
I
read
had
drafted
highly
original
responses
that
were
still
appropriate
for
an
academic
forum.
Granted,
several
papers
crossed
the
line
of
orthodoxy
too
far
and
were
too
casual
or
too
reliant
upon
blind
opinion
D
but
reading
the
papers
that
took
risks
and
shined
because
of
them
gave
me
pause.
I
had
been
vaguely
aware
of
the
restrictively
consistent
style
that
I
applied
to
all
my
school
writing
assignments
before,
but
looking
over
so
many
different
approaches
to
assignment
questions
when
I
knew
fully
well
the
manner
in
which
I
would
approach
them
was
eye-opening.
Again,
that
is
not
to
say
that
I
have
necessarily
reacted
to
the
realization
that
my
own
writing
has
a
proclivity
for
the
dull.
I
am
at
a
loss
for
how
to
really
change
a
style
that
has
grown
out
of
years
of
fairly
consistent
academic
success.
Still,
exposure
to
so
many
different
peer
writing
styles
was
certainly
among
the
major
events
of
the
past
year
that
shaped
how
I
felt
about
my
own
style.
Exporting
that
style
to
a
foreign
countryOs
university
system,
however,
had
perhaps
an
equal
impact
on
how
I
related
to
written
work.
My
academic
experience
at
University
College
Dublin
was
remarkably
different
from
anything
that
I
had
experienced
in
the
States,
but
the
playing
field
was
leveled
by
the
fact
that
clear
writing
and
logical
argumentation
was
as
valued
on
the
Emerald
Isle
as
it
is
on
this
side
of
the
Atlantic.
For
whatever
reason,
I
had
expected
there
to
be
a
perceptible
difference
between
the
preferred
approach
to
writing
in
Ireland
and
the
manner
of
textual
expression
that
I
had
been
taught
in
America.
Granted,
I
had
no
basis
for
such
an
expectation
aside
from
the
considerable
differences
between
American
and
Irish
colloquial
speech
(and
the
latter
nationalityOs
peculiar
penchant
for
unnecessary
insertion
of
the
silent
letter
NUO
into
places
where
it
has
no
business).
The
point
is
that
as
foolish
and
minor
of
a
realization
as
it
might
seem,
recognizing
the
universality
of
careful,
revised
writingOs
communicative
potential
had
a
significant
impact
on
how
I
viewed
the
power
of
writing
as
a
tool
of
persuasion
D
both
academic
and
otherwise.
A
final
influential
experience
of
note
also
arose
from
my
experience
in
Dublin.
One
of
my
flatmates
in
Dublin,
Frank,
was
a
Montreal
native
whose
use
of
the
English
language
had
been
confined
almost
exclusively
to
his
primary
and
secondary
school
education.
Upon
arriving
in
Ireland
all
of
his
courses
and
his
written
coursework
were
to
be
presented
in
English.
To
think
that
a
person
whose
command
of
English
was
inversely
proportional
to
the
number
of
pints
of
Guinness
that
he
drank
in
a
night
would
be
required
to
produce
all
of
his
academic
writing
in
that
very
language
would
seem
a
daunting
task.
I
offered
to
read
over
his
papers
and
presentations
prior
to
their
submission
and
found,
with
some
surprise,
that
they
were
excellently
crafted
pieces
of
writing.
Aside
from
frequent
Lower
Order
concerns
like
verb
tense
and
homophone
confusion,
his
papers
were
organized
and
remarkably
clear
for
an
English
Language
Learner
whose
English
skills
were
only
in
their
adolescence.
More
important
to
this
narrative,
however,
was
how
struck
I
was
by
the
absence
of
idiomatic
English
and
any
of
the
tired,
well
known
turns
of
phrase
found
incessantly
in
the
work
of
paperback
novelists
and
poor
journalists
(and,
regretfully,
many
college
students,
present
author
included
[the
last
three
words
are
intentionally
ironic]).
Although
untraditional,
FrankOs
phraseology
and
descriptions
were
undeniably
clear,
just
not
as
readily
processed
by
native
or
longtime
English
speakers
who
have
been
numbed
by
constant
exposure
to
uninspired
word
choice.
I
looked
back
at
my
own
writing
from
that
semester
and
could
scarcely
proceed
two
paragraphs
without
encountering
a
clich.
I
decided
that
as
seemingly
unpolished
as
FrankOs
cadence
and
phrasing
might
seem
to
me
personally,
his
unconscious
exclusion
of
the
tired
and
repetitive
snippets
strewn
throughout
English
language
writing
was
more
of
an
asset
than
a
liability.
I
have
since
made
a
deliberate,
if
half-hearted,
attempt
to
limit
my
use
of
established
turns
of
phrase
as
a
crutch
to
support
ideas
that
I
do
not
seem
to
have
sufficient
ownership
of
to
express
them
in
my
own
words.
Between
my
work
as
a
Writing
Associate,
my
exposure
to
a
foreign
University
system
and
the
increased
volume
of
written
work
required
for
my
academic
courses,
the
past
year
has
offered
up
a
number
of
situations
with
the
potential
to
affect
my
views
and
approach
to
writing
and
revision;
exactly
how
they
may
have
done
so,
as
I
mentioned
initially,
is
fairly
difficult
to
pin
down.
The
narrative
that
I
have
constructed
above
to
communicate
my
memories
of
the
events
listed
above,
however,
seems
to
offer
some
insight
into
the
path
that
I
have
taken.
I
have
begun
applying
a
rigorous
rereading
to
my
written
work
with
a
partially
subconscious
focus
on
the
Higher
Order
concerns
that
WAs
are
meant
to
address;
I
relate
to
my
own
writing
differently,
possibly
as
a
result
of
the
experiences
that
I
mentioned
regarding
exposure
to
more
engaging
styles
of
my
peers
and
the
freshness
of
a
writer
unbound
by
the
countless
clichd
turns
of
phrase
that
permeate
my
own
writing;
and
I
have
a
newfound
respect
for
the
capacity
of
writing
to
communicate
universally
among
those
who
are
fluent
in
the
language
in
which
it
is
constructed.
While
most
of
these
developments
are
probably
of
no
use
to
anyone
other
than
myself,
there
may
be
a
paragraph
or
two
somewhere
in
the
first
third
that
may
provide
some
guidance
to
new
WAs
as
they
enter
into
their
first
rounds
of
writing
conferences
in
early
September.
To
think
that
at
least
of
few
of
these
nearly
2,500
words
might
be
of
use
to
someone
other
than
the
present
author
helps
to
dispel
the
discomfort
he
feels
knowing
that
someone
will
one
day
have
to
read
a
dry
and
rambling
account
of
his
last
year
as
a
writer.
