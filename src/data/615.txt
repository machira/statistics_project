Literacy
Narrative
Writing
is
one
of
the
most
important
academic
skills
we
learn.
It
is
vital
to
our
ability
to
function
in
society
and
plays
a
large
role
in
advancing
our
education.
Learning
to
write
is
an
ongoing
process
throughout
our
lives
starting
from
when
we
are
young
children.
Each
individual
cultivates
his
or
her
writing
differently.
Some
engage
in
extensive
creative
writing
that
is
publicly
shared,
others
focus
on
personal
writing
that
is
kept
private,
solely
for
the
writers
own
benefit.
How
we
cultivate
and
improve
our
own
writing
is
an
important
thing
for
us
to
recognize
and
understand.
By
studying
the
unique
way
in
which
we
learn
how
to
write,
we
can
gain
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
general
process
of
the
development
of
writing
skills,
both
within
ourselves
and
others.
The
process
of
developing
my
most
basic
writing
skills
fell
into
perfecting
four
levels
of
difficultly.
First,
you
had
to
perfect
block
printed
letters.
Learning
to
write
at
such
and
elementary
level
required
learning
to
print
your
letters.
This
was
done
every
day
as
part
of
my
kindergarten
homework,
in
a
ruled
notebook
with
oversized
lines.
Then,
you
learned
how
to
write
in
cursive,
carefully
copying
the
letters
printed
at
the
top
of
the
page
in
your
penmanship
workbook
in
the
second
and
third
grade.
After
learning
cursive,
only
assignments
completed
in
cursive
were
accepted
by
teachers.
Next,
after
perfecting
your
cursive
handwriting
in
pencil,
in
the
fourth
grade
you
were
permitted
to
use
ink
following
the
Christmas
break.
Finally,
type
written
assignments
were
deemed
acceptable
during
the
middle
school
years;
however,
homework
was
still
required
to
be
hand
written
in
ink,
except
for
math
which
was
done
explicitly
in
pencil.
After
about
the
sixth
grade,
writing
became
less
focused
on
penmanship
or
in
what
medium
you
wrote.
It
became
more
focused
on
the
development
of
your
thoughts
and
argument,
and
your
ability
to
compose
different
types
of
writing.
Writing
for
me,
is
two
different
experiences:
personal
writing
and
academic
writing.
Of
course,
the
two
can
and
do
mesh.
Academic
writing
would
be
incredibly
dull
without
any
of
the
writerOs
individual
personality
being
infused
into
it.
However,
my
non-academic
creative
writing,
meaning
writing
that
will
never
be
turned
in
for
formal
assessment
or
grading,
tends
to
be
very
personal.
The
main
type
of
writing
that
I
compose
on
my
own
is
journal
writing.
This
is
writing
that
no
one
but
myself
is
privy
to.
I
am
the
only
reader
and
writer.
There
is
no
outside
input.
It
is
explicitly
handwritten
in
a
small,
bound,
lined
book.
This
book
is
full
of
my
thoughts
and
opinions,
written
and
expressed
for
my
own
benefit.
Over
the
years
I
have
become
involved
in
several
different
genres
of
academic
writing.
In
elementary
school,
the
basic
writing
format
was
the
essay,
more
specifically
the
book
report.
There
was
minor
research
for
social
studies
fair
and
science
fair
projects.
High
school
however
was
quite
different.
In
high
school
I
was
exposed
to
many
different
genres:
literary
and
rhetorical
analysis,
argument,
in-depth
research
writing
(both
scientific
and
non
scientific),
and
the
keeping
of
a
formal,
professional-style
lab
record.
Literary
analysis
and
non-scientific
research
writing
were
skills
that
students
were
expected
to
have
mastered
prior
to
entering
the
ninth
grade.
Everything,
across
various
different
departments
was
cited
in
the
Modern
Language
Association
format.
Research
papers
were
graded
harshly,
and
returned
with
copious
notations
of
constructive
criticism
in
red
ink.
Creative
writing
projects,
such
as
assigned
free
writing
or
reflections
upon
oneOs
life
(I
had
one
teacher
who
was
fond
of
assigning
projects
meant
to
tap
into
the
Ninner
student,O
mainly
reflections
upon
your
life,
your
place
in
your
family,
etc.)
were
graded
more
carefully.
Commentary
and
criticism
in
this
area
tended
to
focus
more
on
style,
and
less
on
content.
Clarity,
syntax,
and
diction
were
more
of
the
critical
focus.
Little
to
no
commentary
was
given
on
how
you
viewed
your
life,
except
maybe
to
add
more
examples
here,
or
trim
the
fat
off
of
that.
It
was
almost
as
if
teachers
were
afraid
to
comment
on
such
personal
assessments.
My
sophomore
year,
I
enrolled
in
my
schoolOs
Science
Engineering
Research
Program
(SERP),
which
required
extracurricular
research
in
a
lab
for
three
years.
Through
this
program,
I
entered
several
fairs,
expos,
and
competitions
to
share
my
findings,
both
locally
and
regionally.
The
final
goal
was
a
project
extensive
enough
for
submission
to
the
national
Intel
Science
Talent
Search.
As
a
result,
I
needed
to
learn
how
to
write
a
formal
scientific
paper,
which
is
not
at
all
like
a
formal
liberal
arts
paper.
The
genre
was
not
clearly
explained
at
all
by
my
instructor,
who
favored
the
notion
of
students
learning
by
sharing
with
each
other.
We
were
told
what
a
scientific
paper
needed
(abstract,
methods,
introduction,
etc)
but
not
how
one
should
go
about
writing
in
a
scientific
manner.
We
were
to
learn
this
from
each
other
in
small
groups.
The
problem
was,
none
of
us
had
anything
to
share,
and
were
clueless
as
to
where
to
begin.
It
was
like
having
the
ingredients
to
a
complicated
recipe,
but
no
guidelines
or
directions
on
what
to
do
with
them.
The
mechanics,
style,
and
technique
of
the
genre
were
foreign
to
the
entire
class.
I
realized
that
to
excel,
I
needed
to
know
how
to
write
a
paper
successfully.
So,
I
taught
myself
how
to
write.
I
read
dozens
of
scientific
papers
published
by
researchers
across
many
fields
to
get
a
feel
for
style,
rhetoric,
voice,
tense,
and
general
mechanics
(margins,
font
sizes,
etc.).
The
fall
semester
of
my
sophomore
year
was
complete
trial
and
error.
In
each
small
paper
we
submitted
for
evaluation,
I
worked
on
perfecting
a
different
subsection.
By
the
spring,
I
had
the
process
down.
I
was
writing
in
conformity
with
the
guidelines
of
the
industry.
By
my
junior
year,
scientific
writing,
which
at
first
took
me
hours
and
hours
to
complete
just
a
few
pages,
was
much
simpler.
I
could,
at
that
time,
write
a
formal
scientific
paper
almost
as
easily
and
quickly
as
I
could
write
a
formal
paper
for
a
non-scientific
discipline.
Writing
formal
scientific
papers
was
only
one
of
the
writing
aspects
of
the
SERP
program.
The
other
was
the
research
log,
a
handwritten
account
of
your
lab
findings.
Both
SERP
and
an
elective
Forensic
Science
class
my
senior
year
instilled
in
me
a
notion
of
the
importance
of
preserving
the
integrity
of
handwritten
documents.
Logs
were
kept
in
bound
books
only,
with
all
work
in
blue
or
black
ink.
No
other
colors
were
permissible.
Every
blank
area
of
a
page
(such
as
if
you
only
used
half
a
page
or
skipped
lines)
had
to
be
voided,
initialed,
and
dated.
All
mistakes
were
to
be
crossed
out
twice,
along
with
your
initials
and
date
next
to
the
correction.
Every
page
was
numbered
in
the
book
from
its
first
use,
and
each
entry
was
carefully
catalogued
in
the
Table
of
Contents
on
the
first
page.
These
guidelines
were
strictly
enforced,
and
although
they
might
seem
excessive,
were
vital
to
preserving
the
integrity
of
your
findings.
When
I
graduated
from
high
school
and
was
preparing
for
my
entry
into
Lafayette,
I
felt
adequately
prepared
for
college
level
writing.
For
me,
that
meant
that
I
could
write
and
extensively
edit
my
own
work
in
order
to
improve
it.
I
could
find
the
major
weaknesses
in
my
writing
and
address
them
as
best
I
could
on
my
own.
I
could
evaluate
if
chunks
of
text
were
vital
to
the
livelihood
of
the
work.
This
was
harder
in
longer
assignments,
but
after
writing
long
assignments,
I
would
go
thru
each
paragraph
to
see
if
it
tied
back
to
the
thesis,
and
if
my
thesis
was
adequately
supported
throughout
the
entire
piece.
I
still
try
to
ensure
that
I
cut
out
as
much
nonsense
fluff
or
overkill
text
as
possible,
but
it
can
be
something
I
still
struggle
with
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
assignment.
I
expected
college
level
writing
to
be
graded
in
a
critical
manner
that
would
highlight
my
weaknesses,
but
also
that
it
would
allow
me
to
see
how
I
could
improve
on
troubled
areas
in
the
future.
I
assumed
it
would
be
more
difficult
than
high
school,
and
research
writing
to
be
more
extensive
and
cut-and-dry,
yet,
still
infused
with
the
authorOs
voice,
just
not
in
an
overpowering
manner.
My
expectations
were
on
target.
I
was
capable
of
doing
the
work
and
performing
at
the
level
expected,
I
just
needed
to
smooth
out
the
rough,
bumpy
spots.
My
first
year
as
a
writer
at
Lafayette,
I
learned
about
writing
as
if
it
were
a
full
time
class.
The
two
main
lessons
that
I
learned
were
both
tied
into
research.
Firstly,
I
learned
how
to
research
a
topic
in
an
in-depth
manner,
drawing
on
various
sources,
both
primary
and
secondary,
to
create
a
soundly
argued
and
presented
research
paper.
Secondly,
I
learned
about
several
reference
styles
and
how
differentiate
between
each
and
its
individual
usage.
The
largest
adjustment
for
me
to
college
level
writing
was
not
so
much
the
length
of
assignments
or
expected
quality
of
work,
but
rather,
knowing
which
citation
style
to
use
for
assignments
falling
under
the
jurisdiction
of
various
disciplines.
In
high
school,
any
references
or
citations
in
any
paper
(works
cited
lists,
in
text
citations,
etc.)
were
done
in
MLA
format.
However,
upon
arrival
at
Lafayette,
I
felt
overwhelmed
by
the
different
citation
styles
(Chicago,
APA,
MLA,
Turabian),
many
of
which
I
had
never
used
before,
or
as
was
the
case
with
Turabian,
required
for
a
history
paper,
I
had
never
even
heard
of
before.
I
was
concerned
about
submitting
a
paper
with
incorrect
formatting,
and
spent
a
large
amount
of
time
proofing
the
reference
style.
I
sometimes
confused
myself
by
automatically
entering
something
in
one
style,
when
another
was
either
required
or
requested.
After
some
trial
and
error,
I
got
the
basics
down
for
the
various
styles
and
can
now
determine
when
to
use
which
method,
and
in
what
context.
As
I
stated
earlier,
I
tend
to
keep
my
personal
writing
to
myself,
but
have
no
issues
showing
my
writing
that
will
be
evaluated
for
grading
or
submitted
to
a
collection
to
other
people.
I
have
a
small
circle
of
about
five
people
who
I
periodically
show
my
work
to.
The
beauty
of
this
circle
is
that
each
person
brings
a
different
vantage
point.
I
generally
agree
with
their
commentary,
which
is
usually
along
the
lines
of
expanding
ideas,
moving
text
around
to
have
a
better
flow
to
the
paper,
improving
clarity,
and
in
some
cases,
being
aware
of
word
repetition.
I
have
had
some
experiences
where
the
editing
process
has
been
both
cruel
and
harsh,
including
one
this
summer.
When
I
submitted
a
personal
essay
piece
about
my
summer
until
that
point,
for
editing
prior
to
submission
for
evaluation
in
a
collection
of
works
from
different
people,
I
found
that
constructive
criticism
was
in
the
minority
of
the
commentary.
Instead,
I
found
myself
with
personal
judgments
against
me
masqueraded
as
edits
and
a
volunteer
peer
editor
implying
that
I
really
had
my
depiction
of
my
summer
wrong
and
didnOt
understand
my
own
life
and
thoughts.
There
were
some
valuable
pointers
as
to
style
and
mechanics,
but
content
took
a
terrible
beating
in
an
unfair
way.
The
process
was
mildly
upsetting,
and
I
questioned
the
reason
for
the
sudden
and
drastic
departure
from
the
style
of
proofing
I
had
become
accustomed
to
from
this
trusted
person.
Ultimately,
I
have
concluded
that
hopefully,
this
was
a
one
time
outburst
of
commentary
that
was
a
stretch
to
relate
to
the
text,
and
that
in
the
future
we
will
be
able
to
share
my
work
in
a
way
that
will
improve
the
writing.
My
less
than
stellar
experience
this
summer
aside,
I
find
that
when
others
look
at
my
writing,
they
have
the
ability
to
bring
a
fresh
take
on
style,
mechanics,
and
content.
I
am
appreciative
and
thankful
for
those
who
share
their
valuable
time
to
help
me
grow
and
improve
as
a
writer.
When
I
question
them
on
their
criticism,
I
find
that
they
are
willing
to
discuss
their
commentary
and
explain
it
in
a
manner
that
demonstrates
how,
from
their
view
as
an
outsider;
it
is
significant
to
the
piece
as
a
whole.
They
can
separate
the
work
from
the
individual
to
an
extent,
but
still
have
a
feel
for
me
and
my
personality
and
style,
and
therefore
can
see
where
the
piece
is
coming
from.
I
rarely
ever
find
their
comments
to
be
hypercritical,
malicious,
or
judgmental
and
dismissive.
The
commentators
are
never
patronizing
or
condescending,
and
I
consider
myself
lucky
to
have
such
and
well
rounded,
dependable,
supportive
group
to
share
my
writing
with.
This
summer,
through
my
position
as
an
office
clerk
at
a
law
firm,
I
engaged
in
a
different
type
of
writing-
formal
correspondence
and
minor
redrafting
of
legal
documents.
Mainly,
I
composed
bill
cover
letters
and
other
short
pieces
of
correspondence
for
attorneys.
I
also
inserted
the
changes
to
legal
documents
prepared
by
the
secretaries
and
made
the
final
preparations
for
documents
to
be
served
and/or
filed
in
court.
Legal
writing
is
always
typewritten,
and
documents
have
a
different
stylistic
set
up
then
non
legal
writing.
Some
documents
require
legal
backs,
others
covers.
Some
are
to
be
stapled
at
the
top,
others
on
the
side
like
a
booklet.
From
my
work
on
correspondence,
I
learned
the
art
of
writing
polite,
but
succinct
letters
that
conveyed
the
message
in
as
little
text
as
possible.
The
text
of
each
letter
is
always
formal,
regardless
if
the
recipient
is
a
long
standing
client
or
business
partner.
By
working
on
such
writing,
I
have
definitely
learned
the
value
of
succinct
writing:
by
cutting
out
fluff
and
fillers,
you
are
left
with
text
in
which
each
word
is
directly
and
vitally
important
to
the
life
of
the
document.
Having
reflected
on
my
literacy
history
up
until
this
point,
I
have
no
doubt
that
I
will
continue
to
grow
and
develop
as
a
writer.
Learning
how
to
strengthen
yourself
as
a
writer
is
a
process
that
I
feel
will
never
truly
end.
After
mastering
one
aspect
or
one
weakness,
there
will
always
be
something
else
for
a
writer
to
improve
on.
I
have
learned
a
great
deal
about
myself
as
a
writer
since
entering
college,
through
peer
editing,
self
evaluation,
and
formal
grading.
I
have
come
to
see
that
writing,
even
in
its
most
basic
forms,
such
as
an
ordinary,
everyday
assignment,
is
a
skill
and
a
talent
that
is
up
to
each
individual
to
continually
maintain
and
improve.
