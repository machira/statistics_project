WA
Assignment
As
I
attempted
to
figure
out
how
my
writing
had
changed
or
developed
over
the
past
year,
my
initial
reaction
was
to
say
it
did
not
change
at
all.
The
only
notable
difference
about
my
junior
year,
I
thought,
was
the
of
writing
I
did-which
may
be
more
than
in
all
previous
years
combined!
However,
after
some
serious
consideration
about
the
classes
I
was
involved
with
in
the
past
year
and
the
projects
that
I
worked
on,
I
realized
that
my
writing,
or
at
least
my
mind
when
working
on
my
writing,
became
much
more
focused.
In
the
fall
semester
I
was
enrolled
in
several
classes
that
allowed
me
to
write
things
other
than
the
usual
research
papers.
One
of
these
classes
was
Foundations
of
Education,
a
class
for
which
a
number
of
short
opinion
papers
were
expected
of
the
students.
Although
the
papers
were
not
very
detailed
or
serious,
I
enjoyed
the
chance
to
express
my
honest
opinion
without
having
to
worry
about
backing
it
up
with
facts-
it
was
just
my
opinion.
However,
the
assignments
for
this
large
class
had
to
be
short
and
to
the
point,
which
is
ideal
in
many
cases.
However,
for
those
who
are
used
to
introducing,
discussing,
and
then
offering
a
conclusion
on
a
topic,
writing
a
one-page
paper
can
actually
be
very
difficult.
For
two
other
classes,
one
in
the
history
department
and
one
in
the
government
department,
I
had
to
write
research
papers.
Both
of
these
papers
were
assigned
and
due
within
the
last
two
weeks
of
the
semester
and
although
that
seemed
nothing
more
than
stressful
at
the
time,
I
can
now
see
how
that
would
later
affect
my
writing.
Although
I
did
well
on
both
papers,
I
know
that
they
were
hastily
written
and
did
not
have
much
thought
put
into
them.
Yes,
they
were
research
papers
that
were
not
exactly
supposed
to
have
my
"thoughts"
in
them,
but
I
know
that
my
mind
was
not
entirely
into
my
work.
Neither
of
the
topics
really
interested
me,
and
trying
to
emphasize
the
damaging
effects
of
cement
kiln
dust
on
local
residents
truly
challenged
me
to
stay
focused.
It
was
in
my
Comparative
Literature
class
that
I
was
given
assignments
I
could
really
enjoy.
Both
of
the
papers
for
that
class
were
creative
writing
projects
that
allowed
me
to
practically
have
free
reign
over
the
content
matter
as
long
as
it
was
tied
into
a
number
of
themes.
Additionally,
the
fact
that
the
class
dealt
with
Russian
literature
only
enhanced
my
interest
in
the
paper.
Needless
to
say,
I
put
a
tremendous
amount
of
thought
into
my
work.
At
times
when
I
could
not
be
writing
my
"story,"
my
mind
was
often
thinking
of
the
paper.
Everything
from
the
plot
to
the
names
of
my
characters
was
pondered
over
for
quite
some
time
before
I
eventually
began
to
write.
It
would
be
wrong
of
me
to
say
that
this
paper
was
"easier"
than
the
previously
mentioned
research
papers;
I
probably
put
more
time
into
my
creative
writing
than
my
research
papers
that
semester.
However,
the
opportunity
to
be
creative
was
a
refreshing
change,
and
although
I
did
struggle
with
ideas,
I
received
and
excellent
grade
and
I
now
see
that
work
as
the
most
enjoyable
of
my
semester.
As
someone
who
often
desires
yet
avoids
the
opportunity
to
write
creatively,
the
chance
to
work
with
aspects
of
writing
other
than
things
such
as
the
thesis
and
argument
is
one
that
I
yearn
for
as
I
face
the
upcoming
year.
As
for
my
semester
as
a
WA,
I
would
say
that
it
was
very
much
a
learning
experience
for
me.
The
students
in
the
class
I
was
a
WA
for
had
to
write
plays,
an
assignment
that,
although
somewhat
creative,
had
strict
but
simple
rules
to
follow.
In
my
mind
the
assignment
seemed
easy-
there
were
to
be
five
different
characters
arguing
five
different
points.
If
the
students
understood
the
ideas
being
taught
in
class,
it
would
come
through
in
the
writing.
However,
as
I
would
later
see,
several
students
tried
to
be
too
creative.
Instead
of
getting
the
point
across,
some
of
the
writers
concentrated
on
issues
other
than
those
important
to
the
topic.
Looking
back,
I
think
that
I
could
have
done
more
to
reel
in
some
of
those
students,
but,
I
became
too
busy
dealing
with
another
issue-grammar.
I
know
that
it
is
not
the
job
of
the
WA
to
focus
on
grammar,
but
I
was
shocked
at
the
mistakes
that
I
was
seeing
in
college-level
work.
In
some
cases
the
grammar
was
so
poor
that
I
could
not
even
understand
the
point
the
writer
was
trying
to
get
across.
However,
after
several
sets
of
WA
meetings
I
finally
began
to
change
my
focus
and
accept
the
fact
that
my
job
was
not
to
be
a
grammar
teacher.
With
the
spring
semester
came
new
classes
and
new
assignments.
For
my
Russian
Literature
class
(which
was
in
Russian)
I
had
to
complete
a
two
or
three
page
paper
every
two
weeks.
However,
being
that
the
assignments
were
to
be
written
in
Russian,
much
of
my
usual
writing
style
was
abandoned
in
the
attempt
to
simply
get
a
point
across
with
my
limited
vocabulary.
I
always
tried
to
get
an
introduction,
body,
and
conclusion
into
my
papers,
but
my
frustration
often
got
the
better
of
me.
Another
class
I
took
part
in
was
Educational
Psychology.
Each
week
a
short
reaction
paper
and
summary
was
due,
and
as
I
stated
earlier,
I
enjoyed
getting
my
honest
opinion
down
on
paper.
However,
what
I
did
not
enjoy
was
the
structured
rules
that
go
with
psychological
writing.
I
found
it
very
constricting
and
full
of
minute
details
that
were
irrelevant
to
the
actual
writing
of
the
paper.
It
was
the
professor's
requirements
for
the
paper
that
I
actually
found
to
be
helpful
to
my
writing.
Within
two
weeks
of
the
beginning
of
the
semester,
a
topic
had
to
be
chosen
and
summarized
for
the
professor's
approval.
Then,
throughout
the
semester
at
different
dates,
we
had
a
bibliography,
an
outline,
and
a
rough
draft
due.
I
think
that
this
really
helped
me
to
focus
on
my
topic
because
it
forced
me
to
spend
the
entire
semester
thinking
about
this
paper.
The
other
two
classes
I
had
last
semester
had
similar
requirements
for
my
research
papers.
For
American
Foreign
Policy
I
had
to
present
a
topic
and
short
bibliography
in
February
for
a
paper
that
was
due
in
late
April.
Although
this
again
helped
me
to
focus
on
my
paper
topic
and
research,
it
was
my
Russian
History
seminar
that
really
had
the
biggest
impact
on
me
as
a
writer
this
year.
One
of
the
assignments
in
my
history
seminar
was
to
write
a
20-25
page
research
paper
on
a
topic
related
to
the
course.
The
class
met
once
per
week,
and
at
each
meeting
I
had
to
tell
the
professor
and
the
rest
of
the
class
what
I
had
done
that
week
pertaining
to
my
paper.
The
topic
was
due
within
two
weeks
of
the
beginning
of
the
semester
and
a
detailed
outline
and
bibliography
were
also
to
be
completed
early
on
in
the
semester.
The
class
discussions
on
the
papers
helped
because
not
only
did
I
get
to
comment
on
other
papers
but
I
received
feedback
as
well.
Although
I
never
really
had
problems
with
a
thesis
or
argument,
I
saw
how
many
students
in
the
class
would
simply
present
their
topic
as
a
report
without
any
real
thesis
statement.
This
frustrated
me
as
a
writer
because
I
struggled
with
my
topic
for
some
time
and
I
had
many
meetings
with
my
professor.
I
knew
what
I
wanted
to
discuss,
the
Cold
War,
but
I
was
having
internal
issues
with
what
angle
I
was
trying
to
present
and
how
I
was
going
to
narrow
down
my
time
frame.
Therefore
I
was
irritated
when
other
students
would
announce
their
topic
as
"the
Berlin
Blockade"
and
then
comment
no
further.
What
were
they
going
to
say
about
the
crisis?
Were
they
going
to
justify
the
action
of
the
Russians?
Were
they
going
to
show
how
Berlin
as
a
whole
may
have
been
lost
to
the
Russians
if
not
for
the
American
action?
I
think
that
the
exercise
I
had
in
that
class
helped
me
to
prepare
for
my
semester
as
a
WA.
In
the
spring
semester
I
did
not
have
much
contact
with
my
assigned
professor
and
thus
felt
somewhat
unprepared
for
some
of
my
WA
meetings.
I
knew
that
each
student
was
to
write
a
research
paper
pertaining
to
an
issue
of
importance
in
a
certain
time
period,
but
I
did
not
know
the
details.
So,
when
I
met
with
each
student
(or
those
who
chose
to
show
up
that
semester)
I
made
them
aware
that
I
did
not
know
exactly
what
was
expected
but
that
I
could
help
with
the
general
issues.
What
I
did
was
similar
to
what
I
did
in
my
seminar
class.
For
the
first
set
of
meetings,
which
were
simply
to
go
over
topic
proposals,
I
asked
each
student
not
just
what
his
topic
was
but
what
his
thesis
was.
When
I
saw
some
confused
students
who
seemed
to
be
writing
bibliographies,
I
asked
them
why
they
wrote
about
who
they
did.
What
made
him/her
important
to
the
time
period?
I
tried
to
get
the
students
to
tell
me
what
they
were
trying
to
say
in
their
papers,
not
just
what
they
were
writing
about.
I
found
that
with
this
class
and
assignment,
which
dealt
with
many
different
topics
instead
of
just
one,
I
was
focused
much
more
on
the
topic
and
much
less
so
on
grammar.
In
fact,
instead
of
taking
time
to
point
out
the
many
grammatical
mistakes
I
often
encountered,
I
simply
added
that
grammar
had
to
be
reviewed
and
I
underlined
or
pointed
out
only
one
or
two
mistakes.
In
addition
to
the
above-mentioned
changes,
I
also
changed
my
overall
approach
to
the
meetings.
I
found
that
I
had
to
become
much
more
blunt
and
that
I
had
to
become
much
more
strict
in
my
rescheduling
policies.
In
the
fall
semester
I
rescheduled
every
appointment
that
was
missed
and
I
agreed
to
reschedule
many
appointments
that
were
cancelled
on
short
notice.
However,
in
the
spring
semester,
although
I
was
still
accommodating,
I
was
not
nearly
as
patient.
Many
students
missed
their
meetings
and
I
constantly
had
people
calling
to
reschedule
due
to
the
professor's
constant
changing
of
due
dates.
Finally,
after
a
set
of
meetings
where
I
had
six
out
of
fourteen
students
show,
I
sent
an
e-mail
to
the
professor,
who
did
not
respond.
So,
with
my
own
busy
schedule
in
mind,
I
sent
e-mail
to
the
addresses
of
those
students
I
knew
and
I
told
them
that
from
that
point
on,
they
were
going
to
have
to
contact
me
if
they
needed
to
see
me.
I
was
getting
no
input
from
the
professor,
and
with
so
many
students
missing
appointments,
I
decided
I
was
no
longer
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
for
others.
As
it
turned
out,
I
received
a
number
of
responses
to
my
e-mail,
and
as
the
end
of
the
semester
neared
and
appointments
were
made,
students
actually
did
show
up.
My
most
difficult
appointments
were
not
those
that
dealt
with
writers
who
did
not
show
up
but
rather
concerned
two
very
studious
writers.
In
the
first
case,
I
saw
a
student
who,
I
thought,
had
a
talent
for
creative
writing
but
failed
to
follow
the
rules
or
answer
the
questions
given
by
the
professor.
The
writer
told
me
how
he
enjoyed
creative
writing
and
how
he
wanted
to
take
some
writing
classes
next
year-two
things
that
made
it
difficult
for
me
to
comment
negatively
on
this
student's
paper
since
I
knew
how
passionately
he
felt
about
his
work.
However,
I
knew
that
he
was
not
completing
the
assignment
properly,
and
I
did
my
best
to
talk
about
the
class
topics
and
readings
in
order
to
get
him
back
on
the
subject
matter.
The
second
"difficult"
appointment
I
had
again
concerned
a
studious
writer
who
called
me
days
before
any
other
students
in
the
class
began
to
contact
me.
He
was
very
excited
about
his
topic
and
spoke
to
me
about
his
interest
in
what
he
had
chosen.
Therefore,
it
was
with
surprise
that
I
attempted
to
read
his
truly
awful
paper
while
wading
through
dozens
of
grammatical
mistakes.
Although
I
felt
as
if
I
were
"bursting
his
bubble"
when
we
met,
the
satisfaction
I
felt
later
overcame
those
negative
feelings.
After
going
through
each
page
word
for
word,
I
agreed
to
meet
again
with
this
student
to
discuss
a
second
draft,
and
although
that
copy
was
still
not
quite
there,
I
was
surprised
at
the
changes
he
had
made.
The
second
paper
was
easier
to
read,
and
after
meeting
a
third
time,
I
felt
that
his
paper
was
finally
beginning
to
come
together.
Although
I
call
the
previous
example
a
"difficult"
set
of
meetings,
it
was
also
one
of
the
best.
I
saw
a
concerned
student
listen
and
make
changes
and
with
my
help,
construct
a
better
paper.
I
felt
that
I
was
really
helping
someone,
and
seeing
his
effort
helped
