Painting
in
English
Class
I
am
not
a
writer.
I
am
innately
an
artist.
I
was
first
given
this
title
at
the
tender
age
of
five,
when
my
teacher
praised
me
for
coloring
inside
the
lines,
placing
construction
paper
cut-outs
properly
on
a
page,
and
drawing
figures
that
had
actual
limbs,
not
sticks.
This
early
artistic
talent,
if
you
can
even
call
it
that,
may
explain
why
my
first
experiences
with
writing
involved
a
box
of
freshly-sharpened
Crayola
crayons
and
bright
white
construction
paper.
My
utensils
of
choice,
however,
were
those
infamous
NsmellyO
markers.
I
loved
the
thick,
solid
lines
those
markers
were
capable
of
creating.
I
loved
the
bold
color
palette,
the
way
my
drawings
stood
out
when
done
in
marker
rather
than
crayon.
And
oh
yeah,
it
was
pretty
cool
that
they
were
scented.
Although
some
kids
would
neglect
the
colors
with
the
not-so-alluring
scents,
I
wanted
all
of
them.
I
needed
all
of
them.
How
could
you
have
a
successful
drawing
without
a
complete
color
palette?
Never
mind
that
the
black
marker
smelled
horrendously...I
made
the
sacrifice
for
my
art.
When
I
had
mastered
the
pattern-tracing
requirements
of
my
second
grade
art
class,
I
ventured
on
to
make
drawings
of
my
own.
This
is
when
creative
writing
and
storytelling
first
caught
my
interest.
Maybe
it
was
the
illustrations
of
the
books
we
read
in
class,
or
maybe
it
was
a
suggestion
made
by
a
teacher.
Although
I
am
not
sure
what
inspired
me
to
do
it,
I
began
making
up
stories
to
go
along
with
my
drawings.
And,
of
course,
to
best
mimic
the
bold,
black
words
of
my
favorite
books,
I
turned
to
that
black
smelly
marker.
It
was
not
long
before
I
was
spending
all
of
my
free
time
during
class
composing
these
short
stories.
To
me,
words
and
images
went
hand
in
hand.
One
was
not
complete
without
the
other.
If
I
drew
a
picture,
I
would
use
it
as
the
starting
point
of
a
story.
If
I
began
to
write
a
story,
an
illustration
was
a
must.
When
the
weather
turned
too
cold
to
play
outdoors
during
recess,
and
we
resorted
to
indoor
playtime,
I
could
almost
always
be
found
at
the
coloring
table
with
a
few
buddies.
If
you
asked
me
what
I
was
doing,
I
would
say
coolly
and
confidently,
NIOm
working
on
a
book.O
As
it
is
with
most
things
in
life,
if
you
are
good
at
something,
you
most
likely
enjoy
it.
This
is
how
my
relationship
with
writing
began.
During
my
elementary
years,
I
was
often
praised
for
my
talent
and
creativity.
It
was
that
praise
that
encouraged
me
to
continue
to
write
beyond
what
my
elementary
teachers
assigned
in
class.
I
wrote
for
funEand
a
little
for
the
praiseEbut
most
importantly,
because
I
genuinely
enjoyed
it.
My
happy-go-lucky
days
of
recess
abruptly
ended
with
the
start
of
middle
school
-symbolically
and
quite
literally.
Middle
school
meant
five
new
teachers.
Changing
classes
at
the
bell.
Having
my
own
locker.
Middle
school
meant
growing
up.
As
is
the
trend
with
most
twelve-year-olds,
I
fell
victim
to
the
Nfitting
inO
syndrome
that
plagues
the
preteen
years.
It
was
no
longer
cool
to
write
short
stories
during
my
free
time.
Any
extracurricular
writing
I
did
during
middle
school
most
likely
contained
the
acronyms
NLOLO,
NOMGO,
or
NTTYLO,
written
on
notes
my
girlfriends
and
I
passed
back
and
forth
during
study
hall.
I
still
loved
my
art
electives,
and
excelled
in
my
English
classes,
which
focused
on
basics
and
fundamentals:
grammar,
punctuation,
and
vocabulary.
I
learned
how
to
make
resource
note
cards,
how
to
properly
write
a
bibliography.
Because
I
had
a
knack
for
writing,
these
basics
came
relatively
easily
to
me,
but
simultaneously,
they
lulled
my
creativity
to
sleep.
The
imaginative,
carefree
elementary
school
girl
had
gone
dormant.
Eighth
grade
English
revived
my
writing
creativity
as
more
interesting
genres
of
English
and
writing
were
formally
introduced
to
me.
Persuasive
writing
appealed
to
me
because
I
liked
to
be
creative
in
the
ways
I
approached
arguments.
Descriptive
writing
allowed
the
artist
in
me
to
paint
pictures
with
words.
During
the
winter
of
that
year,
I
wrote
a
short
descriptive
narrative
about
visiting
my
grandparentsO
house
for
Christmas,
and
vividly
described
the
smell
of
the
house,
the
scenery,
the
noises,
as
much
of
the
atmosphere
as
I
could
capture.
Upon
reading
my
piece,
my
eighth
grade
teacher
suggested
that
I
share
the
narrative
with
my
family,
that
I
possibly
give
it
as
a
gift
to
my
grandparents.
I
followed
her
suggestion,
and
after
my
grandfather
slowly
lowered
his
reading
glasses
from
his
eyes,
I
remember
seeing
pride
beam
across
his
face.
It
was
comparable
to
the
praise
I
received
as
a
little
girl
for
making
picture
books,
or
at
least
my
personal
joy
and
feeling
of
accomplishment
stemmed
from
the
same
roots.
I
felt
proud
of
myself.
I
felt
confident.
I
felt
like
a
writer.
My
transition
to
high
school
went
relatively
more
smoothly
than
the
move
from
elementary
to
middle,
both
socially
and
academically.
My
ninth
grade
English
teacher
introduced
me
to
the
world
of
Shakespeare,
and
I
found
that
sonnets
and
I
got
along
splendidly.
Poetry
was
like
art.
The
time
and
thought
put
into
making
words
sound
so
beautiful
fascinated
me.
There
was
no
bibliography
required,
and
proper
punctuation
was
a
non-issue.
The
author
was
the
artist,
using
the
English
language
as
his
color
palette.
I
thrived
on
analyzing
poems
and
their
meanings,
and
I
would
often
treat
poems
as
riddles
or
puzzles
I
had
to
solve
in
order
to
reveal
the
true
meaning.
Always
though,
most
importantly,
the
language
took
center
stage.
Again,
I
compared
it
to
art:
poems
do
not
have
to
rhyme
or
follow
any
prescribed
logical
pattern.
Comparably,
art
follows
its
own
rules:
above
all
else,
the
art
need
not
matter
to
anyone
but
the
artist.
My
eleventh
grade
AP
Language
class
proved
to
be
the
most
demanding
English
class
I
had
taken
up
until
that
point
in
my
academic
career.
To
my
teacher,
English
was
a
religion
and
the
St.
MartinOs
Handbook
was
the
Bible.
She
drilled
us
on
MLA
formatting,
works
cited
pages,
and
every
sort
of
clause
in
the
language.
When
a
paper
was
due,
we
would
have
two
peer
editing
sessions
in
class,
attempting
in
vain
to
make
our
papers
as
close
to
perfect
as
possible.
Even
if
a
paper
was
good,
there
was
always
room
for
improvement,
and
she
made
this
statement
though
her
very
liberal
use
of
red
ink.
Although
AP
Language
was
a
NtoughO
English
class,
I
consider
it
the
class
that
best
prepared
me
for
college
level
writing.
It
was
reminiscent
of
my
middle
school
classes,
where
basics
were
the
focus:
grammar,
punctuation,
vocabulary.
However,
through
my
transition
from
sixth
grade
English
to
high
school
AP
Language,
those
basics
had
become
advanced...advanced
to
the
point
where
I
actually
had
to
start
studying
for
English
class.
Until
that
point,
English
and
writing
had
come
so
naturally
to
me
that
I
rarely
spent
time
studying
or
preparing
for
class.
I
would
hardly
stress
about
papers
that
were
due...I
always
was
confident
that
not
only
would
I
finish
them,
they
would
be
AOs.
AP
Language
taught
me
that
I
could
do
better...that
I
would
need
to
put
in
a
little
extra
effort
in
order
to
get
those
AOs
that
had
come
so
easily
before.
Twelfth
grade
rolled
around,
and
before
I
knew
it,
it
was
time
to
start
applying
to
colleges.
I
was
enrolled
in
AP
Literature
that
year,
and
to
my
advantage,
my
teacher
was
actually
a
former
college
admissions
officer.
She
willingly
put
literature
on
the
back
burner
for
about
the
first
month
of
school
in
order
to
focus
on
the
college
admissions
process,
particularly
the
dreaded
essay.
Kids
in
class
had
so
many
questions
about
the
essay
-
what
catches
an
admissions
officerOs
eye,
how
long
should
the
essay
be,
et
cetera
et
cetera.
Although
there
was
a
long
list
of
questions,
the
most
popular
had
to
be,
NWhat
do
I
write
about?O
How
do
you
accurately
and
thoroughly
express
yourself
as
a
person
on
an
eight
and
a
half
by
eleven
page
of
paper?
It
is
true
that
much
of
the
admissions
process
is
based
on
the
studentOs
academic
successes,
but
my
teacher
assured
the
class
that
if
a
student
is
on
the
fence,
a
solid
essay
could
tip
the
scale.
In
my
case,
I
needed
a
solid
essay
to
display
my
writing
abilities,
and
to
make
up
for
my
so-so
math
abilities.
But
what
was
I
going
to
write
about?
As
kids
began
coming
into
class
with
their
possible
ideas,
I
found
myself
lost
for
ideas.
To
me,
it
had
all
been
done
before.
I
could
write
about
my
experiences
with
basketball
and
how
that
shaped
me
as
a
person,
I
could
write
about
a
family
situation
and
how
that
shaped
me
as
a
person,
I
could
write
about
a
personal
accomplishment
and
how
it
shaped
me
as
person,
the
list
went
on
and
on.
Did
I
want
to
showcase
an
experience
that
Nshaped
me
as
a
personO
at
all?
It
all
seemed
so
cliche.
Then,
one
Saturday
early
that
fall,
it
happened.
To
say
that
I
experienced
something
college
essay-worthy
is
not
right...it
was
deeper
than
that.
It
was
something
that
IOll
remember
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
I
was
at
a
friendOs
baseball
game,
sitting
on
the
bleachers,
when
I
was
approached
by
a
stray
cat.
To
give
a
quick
synopsis,
my
family
and
I
are
cat
people.
We
own
five,
four
of
which
we
rescued
as
stray
kittens.
So,
naturally,
being
a
cat
person,
my
heart
sank
when
I
noticed
the
animalOs
ribs
poking
through
its
matted
coat.
Not
only
was
this
cat
homeless,
it
was
starving.
I
got
up
out
of
my
seat,
walked
over
to
the
concessions
stand,
and
bought
a
hotdog...of
course,
for
myself.
I
nonchalantly
began
tearing
off
little
pieces
of
the
hotdog,
dropping
them
in
my
path
back
to
the
bleachers.
The
cat
followed
me,
guzzling
up
each
piece
I
dropped.
So
we
sat
together,
the
cat
and
I,
and
I
fed
him
the
hotdog.
Suddenly,
out
of
nowhere,
a
little
girl
ran
up
to
us
and
snatched
the
cat
away.
She
literally
picked
him
up
and
ran
off
with
him.
Obviously,
this
was
not
going
to
work
out.
The
cat
probably
had
not
eaten
in
a
week,
and
it
was
certainly
not
going
to
stay
with
the
little
girl
when
he
could
have
a
hotdog
with
me.
The
cat
broke
free
of
the
girlOs
grasp
and
scampered
back
to
me.
The
little
girl
followed,
and,
eventually,
we
began
feeding
the
cat
the
hotdog
together.
I
tried
to
talk
to
this
girl,
asking
her
if
she
had
a
cat
at
home,
talking
about
how
cute
he
was,
anything
to
start
a
conversation.
The
little
girl
said
nothing.
Not
one
word.
I
guessed
that
she
was
around
four
or
five
years
old,
and
maybe
she
was
just
shy.
She
would
giggle
every
now
and
then,
but
after
awhile
I
gave
up
trying
to
talk
to
her.
We
sat
there,
played
with
the
cat,
smiled
and
laughed.
To
make
a
long
story
short,
the
new
friend
I
had
made
was
deaf.
I
later
found
this
out
when
she
ran
back
to
her
father
and
I
watched
them
sign
to
each
other.
I
was
shocked.
It
all
made
sense.
She
was
not
responding
to
me
because
she
could
not
hear
me...not
because
she
was
shy.
This
was
the
first
time
I
had
ever
really
interacted
with
a
deaf
person,
and
I
did
not
even
have
any
knowledge
of
her
disability.
When
I
went
home
that
night,
I
did
not
tell
my
parents
what
had
happened.
I
went
to
work
writing
the
story.
I
wrote
about
the
emaciated
cat,
how
my
soft
spot
for
animals
caused
me
to
buy
the
cat
a
hotdog,
and
how
I
never
in
a
hundred
years
could
have
guessed
what
happened
next.
I
wrote
about
the
barrier
of
language
and
how
easily
it
was
broken
with
smiles
and
laughter.
The
little
girl
and
I
did
not
need
to
say
a
word
to
each
other.
The
smiles
and
laughter
gave
us
a
connection
that
words
could
not.
I
wrote
and
wrote
and
wrote.
I
was
so
eager
to
share
my
story,
but
I
did
not
want
to
spoil
it
by
just
blurted
out
what
had
happened.
I
needed
to
paint
the
picture.
The
experience
had
moved
me
so
greatly
that
I
wanted
to
give
it
the
time
and
attention
it
deserved.
I
titled
it,
NIf
You
Give
a
Cat
a
Hotdog,O
a
spinoff
of
one
of
my
favorite
childhood
books,
If
You
Give
a
Mouse
a
Cookie.
To
this
day,
I
consider
it
one
of
the
best
pieces
I
have
ever
written.
This
would
be
my
college
essay.
My
last
two
years
of
high
school
prepared
me
well
for
the
transition
to
college.
My
junior
year
laid
the
foundation
for
writing
fundamentals,
while
my
senior
year
allowed
me
to
develop
my
own
personal
writing
style,
and
experiment
with
the
artistic
and
creative
side
of
my
personality.
I
entered
Lafayette
not
fearful
of
the
expectations
of
my
professors,
rather,
eager
to
show
off
my
talent.
Naturally,
as
with
any
new
teachers,
different
professors
have
varying
expectations,
but
I
found
that
adjustment
to
be
much
easier
than
learning
research
writing
fundamentals
for
the
first
time.
I
was
thankful
that
my
high
school
AP
classes
had
been
worth
it.
Looking
back
at
the
past
two
years
at
Lafayette,
my
experiences
with
writing
have
almost
mirrored
my
high
school
writing
experiences.
I
find
myself
eager
for
creative
writing
exercises,
or
to
write
response
papers
or
stories
about
my
life.
When
it
comes
to
lengthy
research
paper
writing,
itOs
a
different
story.
When
I
am
faced
with
the
task,
IOve
found
that
it
is
important
for
me
to
keep
organized
outlines
and
notecards
in
order
to
keep
my
creative
story-telling
side
from
interfering.
Being
at
Lafayette,
I
have
come
to
understand
the
importance
of
not
only
figuring
out
who
you
are
as
an
individual,
but
who
you
are
as
a
writer
-
what
your
strengths
are,
what
your
weaknesses
are.
As
I
found
out
at
an
early
age,
I
am
first
and
foremost
an
artist.
It
is
this
artistic
ability
that
has
allowed
me
to
excel
at
writing
creatively,
to
express
myself
through
language,
and
create
images
with
words.
