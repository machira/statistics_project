Literary
Narrative
August
18th,
2003
I
wrote
my
first
book
in
first
grade.
Published
in
early
September
(just
in
time
to
serve
as
a
timely
birthday
gift
for
my
mother),
A
Pet
For
Me
chronicled
the
difficulties
of
picking
out
the
perfect
pet
in
four
short
and
mostly
misspelled
sentences.
Bound
with
red
ribbon
and
complete
with
crayon
colored
illustrations,
it
was
a
huge
success
as
a
gift
even
though
it
never
did
make
it
to
the
bookshelves.
The
only
memories
I
have
of
this
first
act
of
writing
stem
from
the
book
itself,
now
worn
and
tired
but
safely
stored
between
the
pages
of
a
scrapbook.
A
year
later
I
would
publish
again,
this
time
with
the
help
of
my
second
grade
teacher
Mrs.
Ward,
who
would
hand
out
writing
homework
each
weekend.
My
favorite
assignment
was
story
starter
compositions,
a
writing
assignment
where
we
would
pick
topics
and
opening
sentences
out
of
a
jar
at
random
which
then
had
to
be
used
in
the
completion
of
a
story.
I
remember
excitedly
pulling
out
a
topic
and
quickly
checking
with
others
to
compare
whose
was
more
exciting
or
difficult.
Each
Friday
on
the
ride
home
I
would
relay
the
topic
to
my
mom
and
bounce
ideas
off
of
her
all
weekend
before
sitting
down
on
Sunday
afternoon
to
finally
put
my
thoughts
down
in
words.
By
the
end
of
the
year
I
had
handed
in
two
dozen
of
these
compositions
on
topics
ranging
from
rIf
I
had
a
time
machineis
to
rIf
I
won
the
lotteryis
which
we
then
made
into
a
book.
While
writing
in
elementary
school
was
the
one
task
I
most
excitedly
undertook
it
was
not
without
its
difficulties.
One
of
the
biggest
problems
for
me
was
the
requirement
from
third
grade
on
that
good
copies
must
be
neatly
completed
in
black
ink.
I
absolutely
hated
writing
in
pen.
Writing
in
pen
was
final;
no
going
back
and
no
changes
unless
you
wanted
poor
marks
or
neatness
or
were
willing
to
start
over.
I
remember
filling
up
a
trashcan
with
balled
up
pieces
of
white
composition
paper
after
realizing
I
missed
a
sentence,
misspelled
a
word,
wanted
to
change
a
phrase,
or
didnut
like
the
way
I
my
handwriting
looked.
Needless
to
say
this
requirement
was
most
frustrating
to
me
after
finishing
an
entire
assignment
only
to
realize
I
had
made
a
mistake
or
thought
of
something
better
to
add.
After
throwing
away
one
too
man
finished
but
somehow
flawed
assignments
I
had
had
enough.
One
fateful
day,
probably
when
it
was
too
nice
outside
to
be
sitting
inside
writing
and
rewriting
and
rewriting
again
it
hit
me
and
I
suddenly
knew
how
to
get
around
the
system.
While
good
copies
had
to
be
handed
in
written
in
black
ink,
there
was
no
reason
why
I
couldnut
first
write
them
in
pencil
allowing
me
the
freedom
to
erase
and
rewrite
till
I
was
totally
satisfied,
at
which
point
I
wrote
over
them
in
the
black
ink
which
had
previously
been
my
nemesis.
Despite
the
challenges
I
faced
as
a
young
writer,
I
nonetheless
found
myself
drawn
to
writing
over
other
scholastic
endeavors.
When
it
came
to
practicing
multiplication
tables
or
memorizing
spelling
words
I
was
motivated
in
terms
of
doing
well
and
pleasing
my
parents
and
teachers
but
I
was
never
inspired.
With
writing
it
was
different
though.
To
me
it
was
rarely
felt
like
a
chore
or
obligation,
but
offered
a
degree
of
freedom
which
I
embraced
with
an
enthusiasm
and
interest
which
spilled
beyond
the
four
walls
of
the
classroom.
Throughout
elementary
school
I
tried
many
times
to
keep
journals
of
the
trials
and
tribulations
of
elementary
school
life,
and
although
I
would
soon
loss
interest
my
inclination
towards
writing
never
really
diminished.
By
my
graduation
from
fourth
grade
it
was
official.
When
asked
by
for
the
yearbook
what
career
I
hoped
to
peruse
one
day
I
responded
that
I
planned
to
be
a
writer/zoologist/fashion
model.
Upon
graduating
to
middle
school,
I
found
myself
faced
with
more
changes
and
challenges
than
those
inherent
in
moving
to
a
bigger
building
and
an
eight
period
day.
With
the
days
of
story-starters
and
childish
books
behind
me,
I
found
myself
writing
about
books,
articles,
and
science
experiments.
No
longer
was
my
writing
graded
for
completion
and
neatness,
but
on
a
specific
rubric
evaluating
style,
mechanics,
grammar,
and
content.
For
the
first
time
I
was
forced
to
really
brainstorm
and
then
write,
re-write,
and
re-write
again
before
I
could
say
a
piece
of
writing
was
complete.
During
middle
school
I
was
also
introduced
to
and
instructed
on
how
to
properly
produce
many
different
types
of
writing,
from
to
the
documentation
of
research
papers
and
book
reports,
to
the
rules
of
poetry,
and
the
specificity
of
scientific
writing.
As
I
moved
through
my
middle
school
years
I
was
introduced
to
the
idea
of
writing
as
an
ongoing
process
with
its
own
conventions
and
possibilities.
While
the
process
of
writing
was
still
something
I
found
engaging,
the
ever
growing
demands
put
upon
middle
school
writers
were
very
frustrating
and
difficult
at
times.
One
of
the
biggest
problems
I
faced
was
the
task
of
proofreading
and
editing.
Often
times
I
would
get
so
caught
up
in
getting
my
thoughts
down
in
paper
that
my
work
would
be
full
of
grammatical
and
mechanical
errors.
While
some
of
these
problems
stemmed
from
a
developing
sense
of
the
rules
and
conventions
and
grammar,
most
of
them
I
must
admit
stemmed
from
hasty
and
careless
revision.
In
both
writing
and
rereading
I
would
almost
always
get
so
caught
up
in
the
ideas
I
was
trying
to
express
that
I
would
overlook
minor
but
sometimes
blatant
mistakes
in
spelling,
punctuation,
and
grammar.
Time
and
time
again
I
found
myself
frustrated
by
teacherus
comments
that
praised
the
content
and
style
of
my
writing
but
chastised
me
for
mechanical
errors
and
carelessness.
To
my
embarrassment
I
even
one
time
handed
in
an
important
end
of
term
research
paper
on
presidential
first
ladies
with
the
word
Kennedy
misspelled
each
and
every
time
I
mentioned
Jackie
O.
or
JFK.
With
time,
I
came
to
rely
on
the
help
of
peer
editing
and
mom
editing
to
alert
me
to
those
errors
that
I
had
all
too
often
overlooked,
and
this
together
with
teachers
continual
criticism
of
my
hasty
and
careless
mechanics
slowly
forced
me
to
be
more
careful
and
precise.
Even
despite
the
difficulties
of
understanding
and
adapting
to
the
ever
increasing
demands
placed
upon
my
writing,
I
nonetheless
still
found
the
process
to
be
freeing
and
inspiring.
To
me
writing
offered
a
rare
chance
to
take
an
idea
or
assignment
where
I
wanted
it
to
go,
and
rare
opportunity
to
produce
something
which
for
better
or
worse
was
uniquely
my
own
and
unlike
anyone
elseus.
Writing
was
something
I
felt
I
had
control
over;
something
I
could
manipulate
to
my
needs
and
taste.
In
fifth
I
signed
on
with
the
school
newspaper
The
EP
Eagle
and
covered
such
in-depth
stories
as
the
color
war
rivalry,
and
sad
disappearance
of
our
class
hamster
Sammy.
In
sixth
grade
I
was
promoted
to
the
sports
department
and
by
my
final
year
as
a
middle
school
student
I
had
hit
the
big
top
as
editor
of
sports
and
activities.
Even
though
writing
for
the
newspaper
wasnut
my
favorite
after
school
activity
as
I
much
preferred
taking
to
the
field
hockey
and
lacrosse
fields
each
afternoon,
there
was
a
certain
pride
imbued
in
the
job
that
kept
me
into
it.
While
I
enjoyed
the
writing
aspect,
I
think
it
was
the
accomplishment
in
being
recognized
by
my
students,
teachers
and
parents
for
what
I
was
saying
that
meant
the
most
to
me.
In
eight
grade
I
was
also
officially
recognized
for
an
essay
I
wrote
for
the
Dare.
Dare
was
a
program
in
my
middle
school
which
aimed
at
keeping
kids
off
of
drugs,
and
as
final
requirement
for
graduation
we
were
asked
to
write
a
short
essay
on
what
dare
meant
to
us.
In
my
essay,
I
compared
Dare
to
a
key,
and
this
analogy,
however
unoriginal
it
may
seem
today,
took
first
place
and
granted
me
the
opportunity
to
read
my
essay
out
loud
to
my
fellow
classmates.
While
I
was
nervous
about
reading
my
work
aloud,
I
was
much
more
worried
about
the
fact
that
we
were
about
to
leave
the
familiarity
and
comfort
of
the
past
four
years
and
enter
high
school.
Just
as
my
entrance
to
middle
school
had
wrought
changes
on
my
writing,
my
entrance
to
high
school
marked
a
period
of
even
greater
development.
While
in
high
school
I
no
longer
continued
with
the
newspaper
as
sports
took
up
most
of
my
time,
I
found
myself
writing
much,
much
more.
Having
been
introduced
to
most
types
of
writing
in
middle
school,
I
found
myself
immersed
in
the
various
styles
of
different
subjects.
From
health
class
to
history,
from
economics
to
English,
there
was
little
to
no
chance
of
escaping
written
work.
If
anything,
the
sheer
amount
of
writing
that
I
was
assigned
from
so
many
different
subjects
impressed
upon
me
the
importance
of
knowing
how
to
communicate
in
the
different
ways
demanded
of
you.
My
high
school
years
were
formative
for
my
writing
in
so
many
ways,
but
there
is
one
year
and
one
teacher
in
particular
that
stands
out
in
mind.
At
the
end
of
11th
grade
I
found
out
I
had
been
accepted
into
AP
English
and
as
a
prerequisite
was
ordered
to
do
a
few
readings
and
keep
a
journal
over
the
summer.
In
the
journal
we
were
to
discuss
what
we
read
and
anything
and
everything
else
we
wanted
to.
From
these
first
instructions
I
had
a
feeling
that
I
was
in
for
an
entirely
new
experience,
and
the
following
year
I
wasnut
let
down.
From
the
beginning
of
the
year,
MR.
Topper
stressed
that
only
that
we
strive
to
accomplish
two
things
in
our
work;
to
write
with
both
clarity
and
grace.
While
these
two
concepts
initially
felt
abstract
and
unsettling,
I
enjoyed
the
sense
of
freedom
they
offered
and
came
to
learn
how
to
not
only
to
embrace
them
but
to
fully
appreciate
their
importance.
Another
unique
feature
was
that
we
were
required
in
all
of
our
papers
to
remove
not
only
passive
voice
and
all
to
be
verbs,
but
a
long
list
of
rNever
Evers
words.
Ranging
from
nice
to
significant
to
basically
to
frolic,
50
such
words
which
we
had
so
often
used
as
a
crutch
or
clich#
were
exterminated
for
all
intents
and
purposes
forcing
us
to
dig
deeper
and
think
harder
when
putting
our
thoughts
down
in
words.
Mr.
Topper
also
introduced
to
us
his
writing
methodology
which
I
found
drawn
to
immediately.
Under
his
direction
we
were
encouraged
to
sit
down
at
the
computer
and
just
write
our
thoughts
regardless
of
errors
typos
or
typos
or
coherence
without
stopping,
deleting
or
going
back.
We
were
then
to
walk
away
and
come
back
a
few
days
later
refreshed
and
ready
to
refine.
This
style
of
writing
really
appealed
to
me
and
soon
became
preferred
method
of
writing.
To
think
that
if
only
I
had
been
computer
literate
back
in
elementary
school
I
would
have
not
have
suffered
the
angst
over
black
pen
and
probably
saved
a
great
deal
of
good
composition
paper
from
ending
up
in
the
trashcan.
From
my
experiences
with
Mr.
Topper
I
felt
comfortable
approaching
college
level
writing
but
was
still
largely
uncertain
about
what
to
expect
aside
from
much
longer
and
more
arduous
assignments.
Looking
back
on
my
freshmen
year,
I
find
that
while
I
was
prepared
for
what
was
to
come,
I
was
still
humbled
by
what
all
that
was
left
to
be
learned.
While
my
diminished
use
of
passive
and
to
be
verbs
has
enabled
me
to
write
more
clearly,
and
the
absence
of
the
long
forgotten
rnever
evers
words
has
made
my
writing
more
precise
and
original,
my
writing
is
not
without
weakness.
One
of
the
biggest
challenges
I
faced
with
college
writing
my
freshmen
year
was
dealing
with
constraints
and
specificity
of
many
writing
assignments
I
encountered,
which
I
diminished
the
sense
of
freedom
I
had
had
come
to
expect
from
writing..
I
also
still
struggle
to
some
degree
with
handing
in
grammatically
and
mechanically
accurate
work,
having
not
yet
overcome
my
tendency
to
be
hasty
in
my
proofreading.
In
general
though,
my
experiences
as
a
college
writer
have
affirmed
and
what
I
always
liked
best
about
writing;
the
freedom
of
it.
The
best
example
of
this
is
the
final
and
paper
for
my
first
year
seminar
which
simply
asked
us
to
define
evil.
While
I
at
first
struggled
to
describe
and
articulate
this
concept,
I
enjoyed
the
opportunity
to
express
and
back
up
my
own
thoughts
and
ideas
on
the
subject.
I
also
enjoyed
this
same
freedom
in
some
of
my
other
classes;
whether
it
materialized
in
the
ability
choose
what
subjects
to
research
and
to
shape
research
topics
to
my
interests,
or
simply
the
option
of
picking
from
different
essay
topics
on
midterm
and
final
exams.
Looking
back
on
my
writing
career
going
into
my
second
year
of
college,
it
is
now
clear
to
me
that
I
will
probably
choose
a
path
other
than
what
I
had
imagined
for
myself
in
elementary
school.
Realistically
I
will
never
become
a
zoologist/
writer/
fashion
model,
however
I
know
that
whatever
I
do
get
myself
into
will
require
me
to
be
clearly
and
gracefully
use
language
to
communicate,
and
with
a
little
hard
work
I
can
count
on
the
fact
that
I
will
be
fully
prepared
for
whatever
literary
challenges
lay
ahead,
