WA
Assignment
#1
The
paper
shakes
in
my
hands.
I
glance
down
at
my
chest
and
can
see
my
heart
thudding
against
my
ribcage
in
desperate
leaps.
I
stand
in
front
of
a
line
of
neatly
ordered
desks
of
which
mine
is
poignantly
empty.
It
stares
at
me
with
hard,
blank
satisfaction:
the
kind
of
look
that
would
emanate
from
a
victim
as
they
watched
an
assailant
ascend
the
gallows.
My
classmates
fill
the
remaining
seats,
their
faces
blurred
together
into
a
blinding
spotlight
of
judgment,
smugness,
and
superiority.
My
heart
strains
against
the
bonds
of
my
ribs,
threatening
to
explode
from
my
body.
I
begin
to
read.
It
only
takes
seconds
for
my
mouth
to
seize
up,
for
my
lips
to
swell
and
trip
up
my
tongue.
My
words
fall
in
staccato
stutters
from
my
mouth.
I
have
to
remember
to
stop
and
breathe.
As
easy
as
writing
comes
to
me,
I
wither
when
forced
to
present
my
work,
even
if
I
knew
what
IOd
written
was
good.
For
this
assignment
we
had
been
challenged
to
create
a
narrative
from
the
point
of
view
of
an
inanimate
object.
I
had
chosen
spaghetti
and
traced
its
journey
from
the
shelves
of
the
supermarket
to
a
consumerOs
mouth.
Ten
years
later,
my
sister
would
tell
me
she
still
felt
guilty
every
time
we
ate
pasta
because
of
what
IOd
written.
But
now,
as
I
forcibly
exiled
my
words
from
the
solid,
secure
comfort
of
the
paper,
I
could
feel
no
pride,
no
confidence.
The
panic
I
was
fighting
to
keep
inside
morphed
into
outrage
against
the
injustice
of
having
to
read
my
work
out
loud.
The
vocalization
of
my
story
seemed
to
bastardize
it,
suck
the
purity
out
of
each
of
my
carefully
chosen
adjectives,
adverbs,
nouns
and
verbs.
These
classmates
of
mine,
theseE
simple
indentured
servants
of
the
English
language,
how
did
they
earn
the
right
to
be
gifted
with
the
beauty
of
my
work?
Why
should--
I
was
going
to
be
sick.
No,
I
couldnOt
be
sick,
all
of
my
organs
had
frozen.
Only
my
heart
kept
beating,
churning
and
bubbling
in
sick
heat
above
my
lungs.
Somehow,
I
kept
reading.
I
finished
my
paper.
I
sat
down.
Three
weeks
later
I
graduated
the
fifth
grade.
NDad,
itOs
fine,
stop!
Let
me
do
it!O
My
stubbornness
and
my
dadOs
severity
combine
like
oil
and
water
in
the
air
between
us.
I
sit
with
my
back
to
him
facing
my
computer,
indignant
and
frustrated
and
trying
to
suppress
the
tendrils
of
anxiety
curling
around
my
stomach.
ItOs
about
10:30,
an
obscenely
late
hour
for
my
seventh
grade
self
to
be
out
of
bed.
IOm
stumbling
and
rushing
to
complete
a
social
studies
assignment
that
is
due
tomorrow.
My
teacher,
a
narcissistic
egocentrist,
had
commanded
us
to
write
a
story
about
a
cross-country
journey,
done
in
whatever
style
or
format
we
liked.
We
were
supposed
to
describe
the
change
in
land,
climate,
terrain
format,
culture,
etc.
as
our
protagonist
bisected
the
United
States.
Fueled
by
my
desire
to
defy
him,
I
had
decided
to
center
my
story
on
a
farmer
who
rides
his
tractor
from
state
to
state
searching
for
a
runaway
cow.
I
was
thoroughly
enjoying
myself
telling
the
tale
of
this
short,
bumbling
man
and
his
adventures
but
naturally
had
no
focus
on
nor
interest
in
our
actual
assignment,
which
was
supposed
to
be
geographically
oriented.
My
dad,
practically
minded
as
he
is,
was
fruitlessly
trying
to
refocus
me
and
distract
me
from
my
endless
storytelling.
I
was
currently
stuck
in
Utah.
My
farmer
had
just
picked
up
a
heard
of
abandoned
sheep
and
was
searching
for
a
place
to
stay
for
the
night
with
the
flock.
To
my
dadOs
dismay,
I
was
much
more
eager
to
describe
the
farmerOs
evening
with
a
motel
room
full
of
sheep
than
I
was
to
begin
to
detail
his
trek
across
Nevada.
NBut
Dad,
okay,
so
I
think
heOs
going
to
end
up
in
Los
Angeles,
right?
And
heOs
going
to
find
the
cow--O
NAlexandra,
stop
about
the
cow.
YouOre
going
to
have
to
do
some
research
on
the
average
temperature
in
Nevada.O
NBut
no
one
cares
about
Nevada!O
I
pouted.
Who
could
possibly
care
about
how
hot
it
gets
in
a
desert
when
you
could
be
focusing
on
an
awesome
adventure
story
with
a
hilarious
twist?
It
was
late;
I
was
overtired,
and
eventually
I
gave
in.
In
the
next
half
hour
I
finally
finished
my
epic
saga,
although
most
of
my
effort
was
focused
on
the
climactic
ending
where
my
farmer
discovers
his
cow
at
a
Hollywood
film
premier.
I
threw
in
some
lackluster
details
about
weather
and
the
plains
of
the
Midwest,
but
only
to
make
my
dad
happy.
I
received
an
80
on
my
paper.
NYou
told
a
good
story,
but
you
didnOt
follow
the
assignment,O
my
teacher
commented
smugly.
My
paper,
however,
was
featured
in
a
school
publication.
I
couldnOt
help
thinking
smugly
back
that
IOd
gotten
the
last
laugh.
Our
task
was
to
write
a
short
story
in
the
instructional
narrative
format
of
authors
such
as
Lorrie
Moore.
Sit
down,
pick
up
the
paper,
read
the
morningOs
funnies.EThe
only
guideline
of
our
assignment
was
that
our
story
could
not
be
a
how-to
for
any
kind
of
death.
Well,
obviously,
we
all
thought,
rolling
our
eyes.
I
was
at
writing
camp,
and
my
class
and
I
were
bunkered
down
in
a
computer
lab
for
evening
session
workshop.
I
was
tired
and
more
interested
in
who
was
going
to
ask
me
to
the
dance
tomorrow,
but
I
couldnOt
help
being
intrigued
by
the
potential
for
creativity
our
assignment
afforded
me.
The
idea
for
a
breakup
story
immediately
blossomed
in
my
14-year-old
mind:
the
traumatic
end
of
emotional,
even
Dooh-
sexual
relationship
was
so
foreign
and
beguiling.
I
began
to
type.ELay
back.
Close
your
eyes.
Breathe
slowly
and
deeply.
My
hands
guided
themselves
over
the
keys.
I
soon
lost
physical
control
of
my
story
and
let
my
fingers
perform
a
beeOs
directive
dance
over
the
keyboard;
let
the
computer
translate
them
into
words.
I
was
captivated
by
the
way
my
mind
melted
and
flowed
throughout
me.
My
body
was
on
autopilot;
the
creative
juggernaut
of
my
subconscious
was
taking
control.
It
was
exhilarating
and
scary.
I
couldnOt
stop;
didnOt
want
to.
When
I
was
about
three
pages
in
I
caught
myself
and
scrolled
back
up
to
read
whatEI
had
written.EEI
learned
about
an
unnamed
woman
who
suspected
her
boyfriend
was
being
unfaithful.
He
had
just
left
town
for
another
anonymous
business
trip,
and
she
was
having
trouble
sleeping.
She
wandered
the
house
trying
different
methods
of
sleep-inducement,
including
warm
milk
and
soothing
music.
As
she
roamed
through
the
darkness,
all
her
fears
and
doubts
had
swarmed
to
the
surface
and
were
smothering
her
conscious
in
self-loathing
and
hopelessness.
The
story
stopped
right
after
a
chilling
nightmare
had
shaken
her
from
her
brief
rest.EEI
stared
at
the
monitor,
fascinated,
and
placed
my
hands
back
on
the
keyboard,
waiting
for
them
to
pick
up
where
they
had
left
off.
They
lay
limply
in
front
of
me,
as
helpless
as
an
empty
pair
of
gloves.
I
had
broken
the
spell;
I
guessed
it
was
up
to
me
now.
I
started
rereading
the
latter
half
of
my
story
but
stopped
short
after
only
a
few
words
as
the
end
became
blindingly
clear,
as
did
the
title.
I
looked
nervously
over
at
my
teacher.
I
hoped
she
would
understand.
My
story
ended
with
the
womanOs
suicide.
It
was
titled
How
to
Get
a
Good
NightOs
Sleep.
This
was
the
best
story
IOve
ever
written.
My
great-
grandmother
had
just
died.
It
wasnOt
unexpected.
She
had
been
in
the
hospital
for
a
while,
and
at
sixteen
I
knew
she
wasnOt
going
to
come
out.
One
morning
I
woke
up
early
and
walked
into
my
parentsO
room.
They
were
awake
and
sitting
expectantly
in
bed.
I
sat
on
the
edge
of
my
momOs
side.
My
mom
said,
NSomething
happened
last
night.O
NMaman
died,
didnOt
she,O
I
said.
Maman
had
always
loved
that
I
was
a
writer.
When
I
was
young
I
didnOt
understand
the
source
of
her
pride
in
me,
but
later
my
parents
would
explain
that
she
had
been
deprived
of
schooling
as
a
child
because
her
mother
had
wanted
her
to
focus
on
sewing
and
dressmaking.
Although
she
would
later
go
on
to
be
a
talented
and
accomplished
seamstress,
she
remained
bitter
about
her
lack
of
education
her
whole
life
and
took
every
opportunity
to
encourage
my
sister
and
I
to
expand
our
minds
in
and
out
of
school.
When
I
would
get
checks
for
$10
from
her
inside
a
card
saying
how
happy
she
was
that
I
had
written
an
award-wining
poem,
I
was
just
happy
I
had
made
her
happy.
IOll
always
remember
the
loose,
weathered,
wrinkled
brown
skin
of
her
arms
that
hung
in
lazy
sheets
down
from
her
elbows
and
tightened
at
her
wrists.
The
knuckles
on
each
of
her
hands
were
swollen
grotesquely
with
layers
of
arthritis.
The
mountains
of
cartilage
and
bone
moved
and
flowed
under
her
skin,
sometimes
straining
against
it,
sometimes
projecting
in
placidly
regal
waves
under
her
dazzling
rings.
We
were
now
in
France
as
a
family
to
scatter
her
ashes
off
the
coast
of
Brittany,
the
region
she
grew
up
in.
My
father
had
had
a
talk
with
me
on
the
car
on
the
way
from
the
airport.
NYou
know
it
would
have
meant
a
lot
to
Maman
to
know
you
wrote
something
for
her
ceremony.O
The
rest
of
my
family
is
asleep
in
the
other
room.
I
sit
in
the
large
hotel
bathroom
on
the
edge
of
the
tub.
I
look
around,
not
ignorant
to
the
theatricality
of
my
situation.
I
clutch
a
notebook
against
my
chest
and
stare
blankly
at
the
rim
of
the
bathtub.
The
rim
stares
blankly
back.
I
felt
no
emotion
at
the
knowledge
of
MamanOs
death.
I
didnOt
feel
sadness,
remorse,
pain,
or
anger.
Just
an
absolute,
glaring
nothingness.
I
canOt
explain
it
away
because
of
childlike
innocence
of
death;
I
canOt
explain
it
at
all,
and
I
never
have
tried
to
justify
it.
This
was
currently
causing
a
problem
because
I
had
nothing
to
base
a
piece
of
writing
off
of.
I
look
down
at
the
blank
pages
of
my
notebook.
They
lay
flat
and
uninspiring
on
my
lap.
My
pen
lacks
the
motivational
glow
of
energy
it
usually
exudes.
This
was
probably
the
most
significant
piece
of
writing
I
had
ever
been
expected
to
compose,
and
it
seemed
at
the
moment
that
I
would
utterly
fail.
I
felt
trapped
between
forcing
an
emotional
poem
and
living
with
the
knowledge
that
I
faked
grief
at
a
family
death,
or
to
compose
a
more
honest,
neutral
work
and
risk
baffling
and
upsetting
my
family.
I
managed
to
get
something
down
on
paper
after
about
an
hour
of
sitting
and
staring
at
the
lips
and
grooves
of
the
bathtub.
My
father
read
my
work
aloud
on
the
boat,
and
I
remember
trying
not
to
hear
any
of
it.
I
silently
apologized
to
Maman.
IOm
sorry.
You
know
IOm
still
a
child.
IOm
sorry.
I
felt
nothing
more.
When
I
was
in
high
school,
I
thought
I
was
the
greatest
writer
on
earth.
Nothing
I
wrote
could
be
critiqued
fairly
because
no
one
understood
the
innate
brilliance
of
my
creations.
I
didnOt
care
about
the
teacherOs
comments
at
the
bottom
of
my
paper
or
the
fact
that
they
were
riddled
with
grammatical
errors.
I
made
excuses
for
poor
grades
on
essays
IOd
written
at
the
last
minute,
blaming
the
mark
on
an
instructor
who
simply
could
not
appreciate
the
depth
of
my
creativity.
Simultaneously,
my
writing
turned
dark.
My
papers
oozed
sadism
and
death.
I
was
once
prompted
to
write
a
story
where
we
envisioned
a
return
to
our
high
school
years
in
the
midst
of
adulthood:
my
story
involved
my
return
to
the
ashes
of
PeddieOs
campus
after
it
had
been
destroyed
in
a
future
world
war.
Luckily,
this
more
violent
turn
in
my
writing
coincided
with
my
stint
in
a
creative
writing
course
where
themes
like
this
were
tolerated.
Regarded
peculiarly,
perhaps,
but
tolerated.
My
boyfriend
had
just
finished
reading
a
short
story
IOd
written
about
a
mother
who
commits
suicide
on
the
first
anniversary
of
her
babyOs
stillbirth.
I
thought
it
was
poignant,
troubled,
and
genius.
He
thought
it
was
overly
dark,
verbose,
and
melodramatic.
NAlex,
I
think
you
have
a
good
story
here,
but
itOs
tooE
thick.
ItOs
too
much.
IOm
weighed
down
by
the
drama
and
canOt
appreciate
the
story
itself.O
I
snatched
my
paper
out
of
his
hands,
my
face
reddening
and
my
mind
racing.
Endless
defensive
comebacks
flew
to
my
lips.
I
felt
insulted
and
rebuffed
by
his
criticisms.
At
the
same
time
a
searing
fear
was
racing
through
my
veins.
Had
my
paper
been
a
complete
failure?
How
could
I
have
done
such
a
poor
job?
But
I
couldnOt
have;
he
just
didnOt
understand.
No
one
could.
I
should
never
have
let
him
read
my
work.
IOm
still
nervous
about
showing
people
things
IOve
written.
I
feel
embarrassed
about
each
piece
of
writing
I
create
and
am
perpetually
nervous
that
people
are
always
lying
to
me
if
they
tell
me
they
like
it.
In
this
vein,
I
should
technically
be
happy
when
someone
gives
me
a
critical
evaluation,
but
if
they
do
I
inevitably
wind
myself
up
and
believe
that
my
whole
paper
is
useless
and
a
complete
flop.
I
know
that,
as
a
writer,
you
inescapably
compose
something
thatOs
just
awful
and
always
risk
having
to
scrap
an
entire
project
that
youOve
labored
on
for
endless
hours,
but
also
that
this
may
sometime
be
for
the
best.
All
these
realizations
came
in
retrospect,
however.
At
the
moment
I
was
silently
fuming
at
my
boyfriend
for
marring
the
natural
perfection
of
my
story
with
the
suggestion
of
potential
improvement.
My
ego
had
tensed
its
quills
and
was
poised
to
fire
thousands
of
deadly
barbs
towards
his
smug
and
unappreciative
mouth.
Instead,
I
stood
up
and
walked
away,
leaving
him
confused
and
upset
in
the
middle
of
the
library.
I
nursed
my
pride
for
a
few
hours
and
then
turned
in
the
assignment
intact.
When
it
was
returned
to
me
a
week
later,
the
comments
scrawled
in
red
at
the
bottom
that
I
bothered
to
skim
over
almost
perfectly
mimicked
my
boyfriendOs
words.
My
ego
slightly
more
than
bruised,
I
abandoned
the
paper
and
the
whole
assignment
as
worthless.
My
first
writing
assignment
at
Lafayette
College
happed
in
English
205.
I
had
high
hopes
for
the
course:
the
professor
seemed
relaxed,
my
classmates
none
too
stuffy.
But
then
she
passed
out
the
booklist
and
our
first
essay
topic-
I
had
to
write
an
essay
about
difficulty.
NExcuse
me?O
I
blurted
out
disbelievingly
in
class.
I
later
found
myself
in
the
bookstore
purchasing
the
course
textbook,
which
was,
surprisingly,
about
the
essence
of
difficulty.
It
was
the
biggest
joke
of
a
book
IOd
ever
attempted
to
read.
The
only
other
piece
of
writing
that
could
potentially
rival
its
frivolity
was
my
essay
based
on
its
contents,
in
which
I
attempted
to
be
as
much
of
a
sarcastic
asshole
as
I
possibly
could.
NWhat
I
like
the
most
about
difficulty,O
I
remember
typing,
Nis
that
you
find
it
everywhere,
especially
while
contemplating
the
reason
behind
the
creation
of
a
book
that
attempts
to
explain
it!O
This
was
not
the
greatest
experience
I
could
have
had
in
my
first
college
writing
course,
and
it
was
made
all
the
more
confusing
by
the
fact
that
my
teacher
seemed
to
love
me.
Entering
college,
I
still
had
some
residual
bonds
that
linked
my
writing
and
my
ego,
but
that
quickly
faded
when
I
met
a
few
people
in
my
advanced
classes
that
were
much,
much
smarter
than
me.
It
was
what,
in
the
end,
brought
my
pride
in
my
creativity
back
down
to
earth.
IOm
still
growing
as
a
writer,
but
now
I
know
I
have
much
further
to
go
than
IOve
thought
before.
In
writing
this
paper,
I
began
hating
my
writing
style.
My
sentences
are
overly
complex
and
I
add
unnecessary
drama
to
ever
scenario
I
attempt
to
describe.
My
adjectives
are
too
elaborate
and
add
a
sterile
stylization
to
my
work.
However,
this
paper
reflects
the
kind
of
writer
IOve
been
up
to
this
point.
Whether
I
change
or
not
because
of
this
newfound
self-awareness
will
hopefully
come
to
be
seen
sooner
rather
than
later.
Creative
adaptation,
donOt
fail
me
now.
