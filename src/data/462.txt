Project
for
Workshop
My
Literary
Narrative
Fall
2005
Tucked
away
in
a
drawer
in
my
house
is
a
stack
of
stories
told
in
my
voice,
relayed
through
my
motherOs
handwriting.
Not
long
after
I
began
speaking
in
full
sentences
at
the
ripe
old
age
of
four,
my
mother
transcribed
several
narratives
that
I
related
to
her.
These
marked
my
first
acts
of
writing.
Initially,
the
stories
were
centered
on
pictures
that
I
drew
ahead
of
time;
as
I
explained
a
series
of
drawings,
my
mother
wrote
my
words
verbatim
on
the
appropriate
page,
and
then
we
stapled
the
sheets
together
to
form
a
small
book.
As
I
grew
closer
to
age
6
and
the
start
of
kindergarten,
my
stories
evolved
slightly,
with
the
text
providing
the
foundation
and
the
illustrations
coming
later.
Aside
from
these
simple
dictated
tales,
though,
I
had
no
formal
experience
with
writing
prior
to
beginning
first
grade
in
elementary
school.
Unlike
some
of
my
peers,
I
did
not
know
how
to
read
nor
write
at
all
and
started
the
road
to
literacy
from
scratch.
Much
of
the
time
devoted
to
reading
and
writing
during
my
first
grade
year
was
fairly
tedious.
When
we
were
not
learning
the
sounds
of
each
letter
of
the
alphabet
then
stringing
them
together
to
form
words
and
eventually
sentences,
we
were
working
on
the
physical
process
of
writing
D
practicing
forming
letters
in
capital
and
lower-case,
repeatedly.
Such
pen
and
pencil
exercises
where
among
my
least
favorite
portions
of
the
school
day
and
I
looked
unfavorably
upon
school-assigned
writing
until
a
quarter
of
the
year
had
passed.
Fortunately,
my
entry
into
elementary
school
coincided
with
the
local
school
districtOs
launch
of
a
two-year
program
spanning
the
first
and
second
grades
that
sought
to
bolster
reading,
writing,
and
computer
skills
simultaneously.
The
first
year,
known
as
NWriting
to
Read,O
began
in
November
and
consisted
of
herding
each
first
grade
class
into
the
schoolOs
new
computer
room
and
allowing
students
to
write
as
much
as
they
liked
on
a
topic
of
their
choice.
Writing
to
Read
quickly
changed
my
opinion
of
writing
in
a
school
setting.
I
found
the
prospect
of
typing
to
be
exciting,
not
only
because
I
had
no
previous
experience
working
with
a
slick
and
fancy
word
processor,
but
because
I
detested
printing
words
by
hand.
Typing
allowed
me
to
create
work
that
was
legible
and
easily
correctable
(a
significant
plus
for
a
beginning
speller
who
constructed
every
word
phonetically
and
needed
to
make
a
number
of
revisions
under
the
teacherOs
guidance).
I
was
also
free
to
tell
any
story
that
I
wished,
instead
of
mindlessly
copying
letters
and
sentences
from
the
blackboard
as
the
class
had
been
instructed
to
do
earlier
in
the
year.
Writing
became
something
of
a
game,
and
I
looked
forward
immensely
to
each
Writing
to
Read
session.
Every
two
weeks
or
so,
each
studentOs
writing
assignment
was
printed,
laminated,
and
hung
on
the
wall
outside
of
the
classroom
for
all
to
read.
In
general,
I
received
very
positive
feedback
from
my
teacher
and
a
good
deal
of
encouragement
from
my
parents
regarding
these
early
works.
One
of
the
stories
that
I
had
written
was
entered
into
a
school-wide
contest,
where
it
won
a
ribbon.
Receiving
the
small
prize
was
quite
a
thrill
for
me
and,
along
with
the
adultsO
supportive
comments,
led
me
to
continue
to
view
the
act
of
writing
in
a
positive
light.
As
I
progressed
through
elementary
school,
writing
assignments
gradually
increased
in
length
and
diversity.
Specific
questions
and
scenarios
would
be
presented,
to
be
answered
in
a
paragraph
or
two,
such
as
NExplain
where
you
see
yourself
ten
years
from
nowO
or
NDescribe
your
ideal
profession.O
At
the
same
time,
I
received
lessons
in
basic
grammar,
vocabulary
and
spelling
(though
reading
Calvin
and
Hobbes
cartoons
religiously
did
far
more
to
improve
my
vocabulary
and
love
of
words
than
any
school
exercise
ever
did.)
Beginning
in
third
grade,
a
concerted
effort
was
made
to
teach
me
to
write
and
read
cursive
script.
Repetitive
exercises
in
forming
capital
and
lower
cases
letters
resumed,
and
soon
all
assignments
were
required
to
be
in
script.
My
enthusiasm
for
writing
began
to
wane
somewhat.
The
feedback
I
received
from
teachers
regarding
the
content
of
my
work
continued
to
be
enthusiastic
and
positive,
but
my
handwriting
was
sharply
criticized.
School
report
cards
included
a
grade
in
handwriting,
and
it
soon
became
my
lowest-performing
subject.
Fortunately,
fifth
grade
saw
the
introduction
of
some
new
genres
which
were
enough
to
keep
me
interested
and
motivated
in
spite
of
the
cursive
issue.
Several
assignments
that
year
consisted
of
small
reports
that
required
a
degree
of
basic
research,
such
as
consulting
an
encyclopedia
or
two.
It
marked
my
first
time
researching
independently,
and
I
found
that
I
enjoyed
the
process
quite
a
bit.
The
year
culminated
with
a
large
report
on
one
of
the
states
in
Union.
I
was
given
a
long
list
of
questions
(What
is
the
state
bird/flower/song?
What
are
the
major
industries?
What
are
interesting
some
facts
about
your
state?,
etc.)
to
answer
regarding
my
assigned
state,
Massachusetts,
and
left
entirely
to
my
own
to
write
up
a
paper
that
answered
them.
It
was
a
major
undertaking,
given
my
lack
of
background
in
research
and
in
writing
anything
of
considerable
length.
At
times
I
had
trouble
finding
some
of
the
necessary
information,
but
the
final
product,
upon
which
my
teacher
commented
favorably,
was
a
report
of
which
I
was
very
proud.
The
same
school
year,
an
important
event
in
my
writing
history
occurred
while
I
was
working
on
a
mystery
story
for
an
outside-of-class
program
called
Challenge.
The
Challenge
instructor
assigned
members
of
the
group
to
break
off
into
pairs
and
collectively
write
a
mystery
which
was
to
be
compiled
with
the
work
of
children
from
each
elementary
school
in
the
district
and
published
in
a
packet.
Co-writing
with
a
fellow
student
proved
to
be
a
difficult
task
for
me,
as
we
had
distinctly
different
ideas
on
what
we
wanted
to
say
and
how
we
wanted
to
say
it,
but
we
eventually
churned
out
a
story.
Upon
reading
it,
the
instructor
pointed
out
that
the
language
was
fairly
repetitive
-
we
had
used
the
word
NhatedO
in
the
same
context
in
three
consecutive
sentences.
She
suggested
that
we
use
synonyms
whenever
possible,
and
introduced
me
to
the
thesaurus.
I
instantly
became
an
avid
thesaurus
user
and
in
future
writing
assignments
I
included
needlessly
long
words,
often
in
the
wrong
context.
Still,
over
time
my
vocabulary
benefited
enormously
and
my
writing
became
clearer
and
my
word
choice
more
diverse.
It
was
not
until
seventh
grade
that
I
came
to
think
of
myself
as
a
writer.
That
year
marked
a
significant
increase
in
the
volume
and
number
of
genres
of
writing
that
I
was
expected
to
generate,
and
an
increase
in
the
praise
that
I
received
regarding
my
writing.
I
was
extremely
fond
of
several
of
my
teachers
that
year
and
of
the
assignments
that
they
handed
out,
which
were
refreshingly
original
and
challenging.
My
social
studies
teacher,
for
example,
often
had
the
class
write
journal
entries
or
letters
or
newspaper
articles
from
the
perspective
of
real
and
imagined
historical
characters.
It
was
a
opportunity
to
meld
creativity
with
historical
background
and
research,
and
one
of
my
favorite
middle
school
writing
projects
was
a
series
of
journal
entries
that
I
wrote
from
the
perspective
of
a
mid-western
farmer
during
the
Great
Depression
from
1929-1941.
Though
all
of
my
seventh
grade
teachers
were
encouraging,
my
English
teacher
was
particularly
complimentary.
Midway
through
the
school
year,
she
told
me
that
I
was
one
of
the
best
writers
that
she
had
ever
taught.
Though
I
was
flattered,
such
comments
were
detrimental
to
my
development
as
a
writer
as
they
instilled
a
degree
of
overconfidence
that
was
not
to
be
brought
into
check
until
I
arrived
at
Lafayette.
Primarily
as
a
result
of
years
without
any
major
criticism
of
my
written
work,
I
entered
high
school
fairly
secure
in
my
writing
abilities.
Still,
I
had
been
assured
by
peers
and
teachers
that
that
the
expected
level
of
work
in
high
school
would
be
significantly
higher
than
that
to
which
I
had
thus
far
been
exposed.
I
was
somewhat
intimidated
by
the
impending
workload
of
my
ninth
grade
English
class
D
four
6
to
7
page
research
papers
on
historical
time
periods
that
related
to
texts
we
were
to
read
throughout
the
year.
I
had
never
written
anything
longer
than
perhaps
three
pages,
and
had
certainly
never
used
the
required
MLA
style
documentation
(or
any
documentation,
for
that
matter).
The
first
paper
proved
to
be
a
major
chore
for
me,
and
I
had
to
ask
my
teacher
for
guidance
on
MLA
style
on
more
than
one
occasion.
An
unexpected
problem
arose
when
I
began
to
actually
write.
Up
to
that
time,
I
had
relied
on
the
hunt-and-peck
method
of
typing,
which
had
been
sufficient
for
the
short
assignments
to
which
I
was
accustomed.
To
fill
anything
more
than
a
page
or
two,
however,
proved
to
be
a
dauntingly
slow
and
tedious
task.
My
thoughts
so
outpaced
my
fingers
that
I
frequently
lost
momentum
and
had
to
stop
and
rework
an
idea.
The
material
constraints
threatened
to
severely
compromise
my
writing.
Through
regular
online
messaging,
which
I
began
using
during
roughly
the
same
time
period,
my
keyboarding
skills
blossomed.
While
I
failed
to
master
the
traditional
eight-finger
typing
style,
within
a
few
months
I
had
improvised
a
method
that
sufficiently
increased
the
speed
and
ease
with
which
I
could
turn
thoughts
into
written
words
as
was
required.
Each
of
my
research
papers
earned
high
praise
from
my
teacher,
but
more
importantly
each
felt
like
an
achievement
in
and
of
itself.
Researching,
writing,
and
revising
were
a
major
investment
of
time
and
energy
that
yielded
a
product
that
I
was
proud
to
put
my
name
on.
The
papers
marked
the
first
time
that
I
felt
a
sense
of
personal
investment
in
my
work,
which
would
come
to
be
my
favorite
aspect
of
writing.
I
wrote
a
fair
amount
as
high
school
progressed,
mainly
for
the
IB
classes
that
I
took
during
my
junior
and
senior
years.
I
gained
experience
penning
scientific
lab
reports,
speeches,
research
papers,
essays
of
all
sorts.
I
was
glad
that
the
vast
majority
of
my
writing
for
these
classes
was
able
to
be
completed
at
home.
Writing
in
class,
aside
from
requiring
the
use
of
handwritten
text,
which
I
still
loathe,
placed
significant
time
and
space
constraints
on
my
work.
During
high
school
I
developed
a
slower,
more
deliberate
writing
process
that
allowed
for
numerous
short
breaks
and
periods
of
reflection,
rereading
and
revision.
It
was
during
high
school
that,
using
my
new
procedure,
my
basic
voice
for
academic
writing
began
to
take
shape.
Unfortunately,
my
academic
voice
had
a
tendency
to
be
tedious,
long-winded,
and
boring,
a
fault
with
which
I
continue
to
struggle.
In
reaction
to
the
realization
that
my
writing
was
becoming
increasingly
serious
and
tedious,
I
began
to
take
advantage
of
opportunities
to
write
lighthearted
pieces,
and
in
doing
so
enjoyed
myself
immensely.
After
I
composed
a
sample
college
admissions
essay
which
attempted
to
be
humorous
and
off
the
beaten
path,
my
English
teacher
expressed
genuine
surprise
upon
learning
that
her
quietest
and
seemingly
most
serious
student
could,
in
fact,
be
funny.
I
went
on
to
use
the
essay
in
my
actual
college
applications,
and
on
one
of
my
acceptance
letters
I
received
a
handwritten
note
that
commented
on
the
essayOs
cleverness.
An
otherwise
mediocre
speech
that
I
gave
during
my
senior
year
was
received
warmly
by
the
audience
in
large
part
because
of
some
appallingly
bad
original
puns
that
I
inserted.
Instances
such
as
these
and
others
during
my
final
year
of
high
school
were
a
totally
new
experience
for
me,
and
in
some
ways
were
more
rewarding
than
any
writing
that
I
had
done
before
or
have
done
since.
At
about
the
same
time
I
also
began
to
periodically
engage
in
personal,
informal
writing.
At
particularly
emotional
moments,
I
would
write
several
pages
that
tried
to
record
and
analyze
events
of
note
in
my
life.
More
often
that
not
these
spontaneous
bursts
would
end
abruptly
in
the
middle
of
a
thought,
occasionally
even
in
mid-sentence.
Attempts
to
keep
a
regularly
recorded
journal
or
diary
rarely
lasted
more
than
a
week
at
best.
Still,
I
see
no
reason
to
suppress
the
urge
to
write
spontaneously
on
the
rare
occasions
that
it
arises,
as
reading
my
past
thoughts
months
or
years
later
is
interesting
to
me
regardless
of
the
volume
or
span
of
time
covered.
I
have
found
that
Lafayette
has
begun
a
new
stage
of
development
in
my
history
as
a
writer.
Most
importantly,
there
has
been
a
drastic
change
in
how
others
react
to
my
writing.
When
a
paper
is
unclear,
poorly
reasoned,
poorly
organized,
fails
to
squarely
address
the
assigned
topic,
or
contains
any
similar
flaw,
I
can
depend
on
a
professor
to
make
me
aware
of
the
problem.
Initially,
receiving
criticism
of
any
kind
came
as
somewhat
of
a
shock
to
me,
having
heard
little
else
than
hollow
praise
for
twelve
straight
years.
I
tended
to
disagree
with
othersO
suggestions.
In
time,
largely
as
a
result
of
a
positive
and
instructive
experience
in
my
College
Writing
course,
I
learned
that
there
is
an
overwhelming
amount
of
subtle
grammatical
and
stylistic
points
that
I
must
learn
to
raise
the
caliber
of
my
writing
to
the
appropriate
level
for
my
final
two
years
at
Lafayette,
and
beyond.
I
have
also
gained
a
new
appreciation
for
the
power
of
writing
as
a
means
of
articulating
ideas
and
arguing
positions.
Some
professors
have
provided
written
and
verbal
feedback
that
indicates
surprise
at
my
ability
to
express
myself
through
writing.
My
inarticulate
and
rambling
contributions
to
class
discussions,
it
seems,
suggest
an
individual
with
significant
problems
communicating
thoughts
and
making
arguments.
I
was
not
aware
of
the
importance
of
written
word
in
conveying
my
ideas
while
in
high
school,
since
the
vast
majority
of
my
peers
were
almost
as
lacking
in
spoken
eloquence
as
I
was,
so
there
was
no
reliable
stick
against
which
to
measure.
I
see
now
that
the
written
word
allows
for
conveyance
of
ideas
with
a
confidence
and
clarity
that
would
be
otherwise
impossible
for
me.
In
any
case,
I
now
stand
at
an
important
point
of
development
in
my
history
as
a
writer.
I
have
gained
new
perspective,
and
hope
to
make
significant
progress
in
furthering
my
skills
through
discussion,
revision,
and
honest
feedback
from
peers
and
professors.
