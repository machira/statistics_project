Writing
Assignment
Professor
Falbo
The
Wonderful
World
of
Words
I
hated
it.
I
really
hated
it.
Words,
commas,
colons,
dependent
and
independent
clauses,
they
are
all
very
overrated.
I
remember
my
first
writing
experience
being
at
my
dining
room
table
trying
to
tell
my
mom
what
I
wanted
to
say.
She
in
return
would
tell
me
I
was
making
no
sense,
and
then
she
would
write
her
own
coherent
sentence
even
incorporating
punctuation.
I
could
always
talk
and
express
my
ideas.
I
could
talk
your
ear
off
and
never
come
up
for
air.
But
writing,
that
was
entirely
different.
Most
of
my
elementary
school
years
were
spent
writing
like
I
talk.
I
would
find
later
that
this
style
even
had
its
own
special
term,
and
my
now
much
more
scholarly
self
would
say
that
I
was
a
colloquial
writer.
My
sentence
would
start
off
with
lines
like,
"the
thing
is,"
or
"my
mommy
always
told
me."
I
can't
imagine
that
at
one
time
I
wrote
like
this
and
actually
thought
it
was
good.
I
wanted
to
be
the
next
Tom
Clancy
because
that
was
what
my
mom
read.
I
could
do
it
too,
or
so
I
thought,
even
using
words
like
"mommy"
and
"thing."
But
thankfully,
my
lack
of
writing
skills
didn't
go
unnoticed.
I
had
to
go
to
a
tutor
for
reading
and
writing.
It
wasn't
a
treat.
But,
you
did
get
candy.
Every
day
for
an
hour
I
would
work
on
punctuation
and
sentence
structure
and
loathsome
commas.
I
remember
my
first
punctuation
lesson
well.
I
was
told
to
put
a
comma
or
a
period
in
the
sentence
whenever
I
stopped
to
breathe.
So,
if
I
went
for
a
real
long
time
without
breathing,
I
would
put
a
period
so
I
would
get
more
time
to
breathe.
You
get
to
take
longer
rests
with
periods
than
with
commas
and
by
this
time
I
was
thoroughly
out
of
breath.
But
thankfully,
I
finally
recognized
that
the
point
of
this
exercise
was
not
to
go
for
as
long
as
I
could
without
taking
a
breath,
but
instead
to
recognize
the
normal
and
required
pauses
that
appear
automatically
in
sentences.
By
the
end
of
my
elementary
school
years,
I
had
my
first
published
novel
entitled,
The
Dragon
Who
Couldn't
Breathe
Fire.
I
was
quickly
moving
up
in
the
world.
I
really
don't
remember
anything
spectacular
or
particularly
note
worthy
in
middle
school
writing.
My
writing
went
through
phases.
I
started
off
as
a
horror
writer.
Everything
I
wrote
would
have
someone
die
or
some
horrible
accident.
Thankfully,
my
curiosity
with
the
morbid
didn't
last
very
long.
The
greatest
strides
I
made
in
the
tumultuous
years
of
middle
school
came
in
my
ability
to
use
adjectives,
metaphors,
and
similes
to
my
advantage.
At
first
I
over
did
it.
My
sentence
length
would
rival
that
of
Dickens,
but
my
sentences
only
consisted
of
one
verb
and
subject
greatly
separated
with
a
plethora
of
adjectives
that
really
did
not
go
well
together.
But,
it
sounded
good
to
me.
And
that
was
all
that
was
important.
My
first
milestone
came
in
seventh
grade.
The
teacher
read
the
best
three
papers
out
loud
and
one
of
them
was
mine.
I
was
suppose
to
write
about
something
that
incorporated
a
rescue
of
sorts.
Everyone
wrote
about
a
teacher
helping
a
student
on
the
first
day
of
school
when
they
are
helplessly
lost
and
on
the
verge
of
tears.
They
wrote
true
stories.
I
wrote
about
saving
a
drowning
young
girl.
Of
course,
the
story
was
completely
constructed
from
my
imagination,
but
I
thought
the
detail
was
great.
Even
then,
I
thought
the
most
important
part
of
a
story
was
the
first
line.
If
the
first
line
didn't
grab
me
as
a
reader,
I
returned
the
book
to
the
shelf
and
never
gave
it
a
second
thought.
In
this
piece
instead
of
starting
with
a
description
for
the
protagonist
or
the
surrounding
scenery
I
started
the
story
with
my
main
character
slowly
sinking
below
the
murky
blue
water.
I
spent
an
entire
page
describing
the
way
the
water
engulfs
the
body
and
blinds
the
eyes.
This
won
me
praise
from
the
teacher
and
for
the
first
time
had
my
writing
acknowledged
as
better
than
average.
Then
came
ninth
grade
English
and
my
writing
abilities
were
drastically
altered.
I
had
never
heard
of
five
paragraph
essays,
thesis,
repetition
of
thesis,
and
topic
sentences.
All
of
these
foreign
notions
took
the
creative
aspects
out
of
writing,
and
I
now
had
to
tell
the
reader
exactly
what
I
was
planning
on
saying.
I
was
drawing
a
road
map
for
the
reader
and
my
adjectives
suddenly
found
themselves
crossed
out
with
read
ink
and
"arbitrary"
written
next
to
them.
Besides
being
some
petrified
ninth
grader
who
felt
lost
in
a
sea
of
bigger
fish,
my
teacher,
Mrs.
Jenner,
who
later
I
would
come
to
adore
and
keep
in
very
high
regard,
told
me
and
the
class
after
our
first
assignment
that,
"I
want
no
fluffy
bullshit
in
you
papers.
Tell
me
what
you
have
to
say.
Let
you
facts
and
inferences
speak
only."
I
learned
to
get
to
the
point
when
I
wrote.
Instead
of
taking
5
sentences
to
get
to
my
main
point
I
typed
it
right
away.
I
also
learned
about
those
horrid
homonyms.
Spell
check
never
picks
them
up
and
after
typing
a
ten-page
paper
how
am
I
suppose
to
notice
if
I
spelled
patients
or
patience.
Eventually,
I
came
up
with
a
method.
If
I
read
the
paper
backwards
word
for
word,
I
had
trouble
automatically
assuming
what
is
going
to
come
next,
so
I
have
to
slow
down
and
actually
pay
attention
to
what
I
wrote
instead
of
assuming
I
did
it
right
the
first
time.
I
ended
ninth
grade
with
my
first
ten-page
term
paper
on
the
novel
the
Bluest
Eye
by
Toni
Morrison.
And
by
then
writing
was
finally
easy.
I
could
sit
at
the
computer
and
my
fingers
would
take
control.
They
would
just
type.
I
knew
what
I
wanted
to
say,
and
it
would
come
out
beautifully.
Of
course,
I
would
have
to
go
back
and
make
special
consideration
for
emphasis
and
alliteration
and
parallelism,
but
the
ideas
flowed
for
the
first
time
in
a
logical
well
thought
pattern.
My
love
affair
with
words
started
in
eleventh
grade.
I
took
a
type
of
English
class
entitled
oral
communications.
I
was
taught
to
use
language
to
grab
and
entice
an
audience.
But
most
of
all
I
was
taught
to
experiment
with
words.
Sometimes
a
repetition
of
sound
sounds
good
to
the
ear.
Or
a
short
direct
sentence
can
add
punch.
Here
my
vocabulary
grew.
There
were
so
many
words
I
could
take
advantage
of.
I
was
like
a
child
in
a
room
full
of
toys,
if
one
toy
wasn't
quite
to
my
liking
there
were
hundreds
more
to
try.
I
used
words
like
phantasmagoric
and
pathos
and
tumultuous
and
plethora.
Here
I
learned
about
parallelism
and
how
to
deliver
your
writing
to
an
audience
once
the
craft
of
actually
writing
had
ended.
My
fascination
and
love
for
writing
began
in
ninth
grade
but
blossomed
with
further
education.
I
took
every
available
English
class
my
high
school
offered.
In
my
senior
year
I
would
take
creative
writing,
classics
in
literature,
and
modem
comparative
literature.
I
was
in
utter
delight.
I
would
spend
half
of
my
day
writing
and
talking
about
books
and
just
being
engulfed
in
the
literary
world.
In
creative
writing
I
wrote
my
first
submitted
piece.
I
had
never
written
a
play
before.
I
wasn't
even
really
comfortable
with
my
dialogue
between
characters
in
writing.
Mostly,
I
wrote
academic
pieces.
I
wrote
term
papers
comparing
Cather
to
Hemingway.
Or
papers
dealing
with
fact,
such
as
heart
disease
in
women.
I
wrote
boring
papers.
My
first
big
creative
paper
was
a
challenge.
The
play
had
to
be
twenty-five
pages
long
and
submitted
to
the
Philadelphia
Young
Play
Writes
Festival.
I
was
petrified.
I
was
16
years
old.
What
did
I
know
about
life?
I
could
write
my
life
story
in
two
pages.
How
was
I
supposed
to
write
something
twenty-five
pages
long
and
then
submitted
it
to
a
professional?
But
somehow
I
did
it.
It
was
entitled
"A
room
large
enough
for
one"
and
was
about
a
death
of
a
parent.
I
won
no
major
awards
and
was
not
going
to
be
the
next
huge
playwright.
But
I
was
praised
for
my
character
development.
I
took
time
to
make
a
character
come
alive.
I
didn't
even
give
my
characters
names
until
I
finished
the
piece.
Like
Salinger
does
in
his
writing,
a
character's
name
should
be
earned.
A
name
should
in
some
way
say
something
about
its
owner.
My
play
was
also
praised
for
having
an
open
ending.
I
didn't
wrap
everything
up
in
a
nice
neat
ball.
That
is
not
life.
I
left
it
a
mess.
I
left
the
character
crying
in
a
small
dark
room,
her
hands
covering
her
face.
She
was
not
meant
to
recover
from
one
of
life's
greatest
obstacles
in
twenty-five
pages.
I
would
have
needed
hundreds
of
more
pages
and
thirty
more
characters
similar
to
David
Copperfield
in
order
to
have
this
character
end
with
everything
in
order.
I
did
however,
get
my
first
poem
published
by
the
school's
literary
magazine.
I
didn't
even
think
my
poem
was
that
well
crafted.
I
wrote
it
when
I
was
in
one
of
those
hostile
moods
after
being
waken
up
at
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
by
my
next
door
neighbor
wanting
to
sell
me
fruit.
Of
course
I
changed
the
names
to
protect
the
guilty
party,
but
really
it
wasn't
that
well
crafted
with
an
abundance
of
poetic
devices.
Instead
my
poem
gave
a
clear
image
and
made
you
laugh.
I
described
a
situation
I
knew.
I
gave
a
new
twist
to
something
everyone
encounters,
and
I
did
so
with
a
sort
of
dry
sarcastic
humor.
And
for
this,
I
was
rewarded
and
no
one
ever
came
to
my
house
again
at
nine
o'
clock
to
sell
me
something.
However,
my
biggest
challenge
was
yet
to
come.
In
modem
comparative
writing
I
had
a
young
male
teacher
fresh
out
of
college
who
still
hadn't
been
worn
down
by
years
of
teaching
The
Great
Gatsbv
and
Frannv
and
Zooev.
His
first
major
assignment
was
to
re-create
the
fire
place
scene
in
a
"Horse
Dealer's
Daughter,"
by
D.H.
Lawrence.
I
don't
write
like
Laurence,
yet,
somehow
I
wrote
the
updated
piece
similar
to
his
in
which
I
sounded
like
the
perfect
male
chauvinist
who
objectified
women
and
scoffed
the
absurdity
of
love.
In
fact,
my
piece
was
so
shocking,
Mr.
Zervanos
read
it
aloud
and
had
the
class
guess
as
to
the
author.
Of
course,
a
quiet,
shy
girl
who
tried
to
melt
into
the
comer
was
never
even
considered,
and
I
think
I
shocked
the
world
when
they
discovered
I
had
created
such
a
strong
and
witty
voice.
In
writing
I
can
be
anyone
I
want
to
be.
And
most
importantly,
I
can
do
so
anonymously.
I
can
say
whatever
I
feel.
I
can
be
harsh
and
cruel
and
pessimistic
and
sarcastic,
and
no
one
has
to
know.
Now
in
my
writing,
I
have
learned
to
say
everything
I
want
to
say
but
I
can
not.
Writing
has
become
my
disguise
in
which
my
personality
could
shine
through.
To
improve
but
test
my
writing
further,
I
was
no
forced
to
write
my
first
major
fictional
work.
It
wasn't
an
academic
paper.
I
was
simply
told
to
write
a
story
about
anything.
How
awful!
I
had
no
direction.
I
had
nowhere
to
go.
I
didn't
have
a
paper
with
the
assignment
typed
out
word
for
word,
and
all
I
needed
to
do
was
fill
in
the
blanks.
But
worse,
I
had
to
read
this
piece
out
loud.
And
everyone
would
assume
the
story
I
was
telling
related
to
me
or
in
some
way
to
an
experience
I
had.
So,
my
goal
was
to
completely
disconnect
myself
from
the
piece.
I
wrote
about
boys.
I
gave
them
characteristics
mirroring
my
own
and
other
people
that
I
knew
well,
but
I
never
once
became
one
character
specifically.
I
wrote
about
what
I
knew.
Living
in
a
small
town
wishing
I
was
anywhere
but
here
and
I
was
anyone
but
me.
I
squeaked
it
out.
I
was
not
going
to
be
the
next
great
American
short
story
teller,
but
I
could
tell
a
story
and
have
my
characters
be
believable
and
their
emotions
understandable.
For
the
most
part
I
have
always
preferred
academic
writing.
For
my
senior
project,
my
graduation
requirement,
and
a
requirement
for
all
AP
English
students
I
wrote
my
first
twenty-page
paper
on
the
relatively
new
author
Anna
Quindlen.
I
chose
to
focus
solely
on
the
work,
One
True
Thing
and
had
to
deliver
a
wide
variety
of
criticisms.
Here
was
the
first
time
I
tried
my
hand
at
New
Criticism,
Reader-Response
Criticism
and
Deconstructionism.
Academically,
this
is
one
of
the
best
papers
I
have
ever
constructed
in
high
school.
I
found
the
hardest
part
of
writing,
even
with
all
my
experience
with
various
topics
is
getting
started.
It
is
hard
to
force
myself
to
sit
down
and
just
push
the
keys
on
the
keyboard.
I
also
can
not
proofread
immediately
after
I
am
finished
typing.
The
piece
must
rest.
Otherwise,
I
end
up
deleting
more
than
I
have
written
and
have
to
confine
myself
to
a
room
and
start
again.
And
then
came
college.
To
say
I
was
nervous
was
an
understatement.
But
my
writing
preparation
in
high
school
was
more
than
adequate.
The
transition
was
painless.
Though,
I
did
learn
that
you
have
to
write
differently
for
various
classes.
For
example,
I
do
write
differently
for
a
philosophy
class
as
compared
to
an
English
class.
As
of
now,
my
greatest
writing
accomplishment
in
college
came
in
my
college
writing
class.
I
had
to
tell
a
story
about
myself
and
incorporate
some
type
of
metaphor
that
involved
movement.
I
wrote
my
first
very
personal
narrative.
I
wrote
about
the
death
of
my
grandmother
and
incorporated
my
first
extended
metaphor.
I
also
did
not
give
the
slightest
hint
of
who
it
was
that
actually
died
until
the
very
last
line
of
the
piece.
I
had
simply
referred
to
her
as
my
best
friend.
I
had
learned
how
to
grab
my
reader.
I
learned
how
to
peak
one's
interest
with
just
enough
facts
and
to
leave
out
enough
information
to
leave
one
thirsty
for
more.
The
creative
aspects
of
writing
had
finally
come
together
with
the
technical
and
this
piece
was
a
platform
to
bigger
and
greater
works.
I
have
never
really
struggled
with
writing.
Once
I
finally
escaped
those
common
childhood
mistakes,
my
writing
flowed.
At
times
I
struggle
with
topics,
and
I
am
at
a
loss
for
words,
but
I
enjoy
the
act
of
writing.
I
like
to
tell
a
good
story.
I
like
to
entertain
and
inform.
Within
writing
I
can
become
anyone.
With
writing
I
have
found
comfort
within
words
and
enjoy
the
sound
of
tapping
keys
and
the
smell
of
fresh
ink
on
a
clean
page
waiting
to
tell
its
tale
to
a
reader.
