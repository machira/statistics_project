LITERACY
NARRATIVE
August
27,
1999
Although
it
is
generally
difficult
to
determine
the
precise
instant
at
which
a
passion
is
realized,
certain
early
instances
are
highlighted
in
my
memory
of
writing
experiences.
My
first
work,
completed
by
the
age
of
seven,
was
a
mystery
story
that
I
invented
as
a
birthday
gift
for
my
older
brother.
It
was
crudely
constructed:
handwritten
on
white,
unlined
paper,
sloppily
bound
with
staples,
and
self-illustrated
in
pencil.
For
its
title,
Sherlock
Wags.
I
opted
to
combine
what
little
I
knew
of
established
mystery
writing
with
my
central
character,
a
beagle-basset
hound
mix
that
also
happened
to
be
our
family
dog.
Despite
the
silliness
that
this
story
acquires
in
retrospect,
I
recall
creating
it
with
so
much
pride.
Today,
I
can
no
longer
remember
the
commentary
this
work
received,
but
I
do
recall
noticing
the
rugged
edges
of
that
slim
stack
of
white
paper
stuck
between
the
books
on
my
brother's
shelf
several
years
later.
My
parents,
encouraged
by
this
initial
exercise
in
writing,
enrolled
me
in
a
young
writers'
program
at
a
local
college
the
next
summer.
The
dull,
tiled
floors
that
extended
down
the
seemingly
endless
corridors,
the
rough,
gray
cement
walls
that
stretched
to
ceilings
of
unprecedented
heights,
and
the
cold
metal
desks
that
attached
to
my
chair
to
encompass
my
small
body
were
all
quite
overwhelming
to
me.
At
first,
I
only
felt
that
the
world
was
rather
big
and
I
rather
small,
but
the
excitement
of
learning
to
become
a
real
writer
sqon
extinguished
my
anxieties.
Turrting
from
mystery
to
fantasy,
I
wrote
a
story
about
a
little
girl,
probably
not
unlike
myself,
who
catches
the
tooth
fairy
in
the
midst
of
her
work.
While
this
work
was
also
handwritten
and
self-illustrated,
its
cover
was
formed
from
red
construction
paper
instead
of
the
standard
paper
that
I
had
used
for
my
first
work,
which
in
my
mind
made
this
story
so
much
closer
to
"real"
books.
Throughout
the
remainder
of
my
elementary
and
middle
school
years,
I
built
upon
the
momentum
of
that
program,
expanding
my
literary
efforts
beyond
short
stories
to
incorporate
poetry
and
essays
as
well.
Along
with
third
grade
came
blank
verse
poetiy
about
autumn,
though
this
term
was
not
explained
to
us
at
the
time,
and
fourth
grade
brought
the
more
structured
tankas
and
haikus.
In
middle
school,
rhyming
and
counting
syllables
were
replaced
by
the
essay
and
grammatical
rules
became
essential
to
quality
writing.
Despite
the
switch
from
creative
writing
to
scholarly
writing,
my
pleasure
in
the
English
language
increased
each
year.
Perhaps
it
was
this
sheer
enjoyment
that
solicited
praise
for
my
endeavors,
but
this
reaction
to
my
writing
was
to
change
drastically
when
I
stepped
over
the
threshold
of
Miss
Bau's
seventh
period
freshman
literature
class.
It
was
in
that
classroom
that
I
was
introduced
to
Miss
Bau
and
her
method
of
writing
research
papers,
including
a
fill-in
the
blanks
thesis
statement
that
eveiy
student
was
required
to
use,
simply
specifying
her
intentions
in
the
open
spaces
the
teacher
had
left.
After
completing
this
thesis
assignment,
Miss
Bau
accused
me
of
having
my
brother
write
the
lines
for
me,
belittling
MY
hard
work
and
damaging
my
pride
in
what
I
knew
was
a
well-wrought
thesis
statement.
This
false
charged
encouraged
me
to
work
even
more
diligently
on
the
remainder
of
my
paper,
and
after
a
month
I
was
ready
to
regain
my
slandered
reputation
by
turning
in
the
completed
paper
early.
Still,
Miss
Bau
was
not
pleased
with
my
work,
but
my
protest
only
provoked
her
to
tell
me
that
I
might
as
well
have
thrown
it
out
the
window.
Fortunately,
Miss
Bau's
Survey
of
Literary
Genre
and
Composition
was
the
only
writing
experience
that
ever
left
me
in
tears.
During
cross
country
season
of
my
senior
year
of
high
school,
my
writing
^gain
became
not
only
highly
enjoyable
to
create
but
also
highly
personal.
For
my
coach
and
my
teammates,
I
would
seek
out
an
inspirational
quote
that
was
appropriate
for
our
weekend
race
and
then
expand
upon
its
relation
to
us
in
my
own
words.
Since
we
were
a
small,
close-knit
team
comprised
of
only
two
seniors
attempting
to
earn
championships
for
the
last
time,
many
of
these
small
notes
were
very
emotional.
These
were
my
attempts
to
let
my
teammates
know,
through
my
most
expressive
medium,
that
I
was
proud
of
their
accomplishments,
confident
in
their
abilities,
and
sorrowful
about
leaving
them
at
the
end
of
the
year.
There
were
some
great
races
that
season,
filled
with
gritty
performances
that
I
believe
I
had
a
minor
role
in
inspiring
because
of
the
tears
that
my
messages
often
elicited
from
my
teammates.
Another
incident
occurring
during
my
final
year
of
high
school
sparked
the
desire
to
write
within
me.
Those
final
spring
months
were
hot,
often
exceeding
eighty-five
degrees,
which
made
sitting
in
an
unairconditioned
school
building
tremendously
uncomfortable.
This
situation
was
exacerbated
by
the
ban
that
the
administration
placed
on
tank-tops
and
the
threat
that
any
student
wearing
such
an
article
was
subject
to
suspension.
Frustrated
by
this
ludicrous
circumstance,
I
wrote
an
editorial
that
was
eventually
printed
by
a
local
newspaper.
In
that
article,
I
questioned
why
the
school
board
was
unable
to
focus
on
issues
that
pertained
more
to
the
education
of
students
than
supposedly
"distracting"
tank
tops.
Reaction
to
the
editorial
was
polar:
my
principal
berated
me
for
it
while
many
teachers
and
students
applauded
my
.attempts.
Also
during
my
senior
year,
I
encountered
Miss
Carboy
and
an
approach
to
essays
that
eradicated
all
traces
of
Miss
Bau's
misdirected
influence.
At
first
her
directions
to
include
quotations
from
the
text
within
my
writing
confused
me;
it
seemed
that
I
was
simply
rearranging
someone
else's
words
instead
of
inventing
with
my
own.
After
one
poor
attempt
at
this
style
of
writing,
Miss
Carboy
pulled
me
aside
and
reviewed
the
procedure:
draw
my
own
conclusions
relating
to
the
topic
but
validate
them
with
textual
support.
With
Miss
Carboy's
supervision,
I
sharpened
my
skills
of
essay
organization
and
effectiveness
through
use
of
parallel
structure
and
conclusions
that
expand
rather
than
summarize.
Because
of
my
work
in
that
Advanced
Placement
English
class
and
Miss
Carboy's
patience
as
my
mentor,
I
have
come
to
consider
the
essay
my
strongest
and
most
powerful
form
of
written
expression.
With
this
bolstered
confidence,
I
approached
college
writing
feeling
that
I
was
able
to
read
difficult
material
and
reflect
upon
it
in
an
intelligent
manner.
While
this
was
true
to
an
extent,
I
failed
to
acknowledge
the
limitations
of
my
abilities
and
of
my
experiences.
From
an
early
age,
I
had
been
exposed
to
creative
writing
forms
such
as
poetiy
and
short
stories,
while
my
high
school
years
encompassed
the
basic
scholarly
writing
models,
the
research
paper
and
the
essay.
Yet
not
until
my
First
Year
Seminar
did
I
learn
an
entirely
new
technique,
biographical
narrative
writing.
Unlike
my
previous
creative
efforts,
this
genre
required
usage
of
fact
rather
than
fiction,
and
unlike
my
prior
scholarly
writing,
this
genre
needed
a
story
rather
than
an
argument/support
structure.
On
an
early
First
Year
Seminar
assignment,
I
relied
on
the
strength
of
my
essays,
filling
the
narrative
with
quotes,
only
to
the
disappointment
of
my
professor.
I
soon
learned
that
for
this
type
of
writing,
facts
drawn
from
the
text
were
neither
as
interesting
nor
as
productive
in
making
a
distant
scene
come
to
life
as
was
description.
Aside
from
this
introduction
to
a
new
writing
technique
during
my
First
Year
Seminar,
the
expectations
of
my
professors
generally
coincided
with
my
expectations
of
college
writing.
The
high
standards
of
my
professors
were
not
surprising
to
me,
although
the
degree
of
independence
which
they
granted,
particularly
in
the
area
of
topic
selection,
was
quite
a
novel
concept
for
me.
On
more
than
one
occasion,
I
incorporated
my
knowledge
from
one
class
into
a
paper
for
another,
discussing
the
artwork
of
William
Blake
alongside
of
his
poetiy
and
examining
how
cover
artwork
reflects
upon
the
literature
itself.
In
this
manner,
I
was
exposed
to
a
wider
range
of
topics
and
research
materials
than
I
had
ever
before
utilized.
Due
to
this
sudden
abundance
of
information
surrounding
me
and
the
constantly
present
opportunity
to
write
well,
I
began
to
take
myself
seriously
as
a
writer
during
my
freshman
year
of
college.
This
change
affected
my
work
pertaining
to
classroom
assignments
to
a
small
degree,
since
I
had
always
strived
to
achieve
academically.
Effected
more
dramatically
was
my
selfmotivated
writing,
the
notebooks
half-full
of
scrawled
lines
and
the
scattered
pieces
that
I
had
deemed
worthy
to
type.
These
I
gathered
together,
typing
and
organizing
the
scraps
of
paper
with
the
intent
of
creating
a
portfolio.
Recalling
my
grammar
school
writing,
I
wanted
a
book
of
my
own,
a
work
with
a
cover
bearing
a
title
above
my
name
and
pages
filled
with
my
words.
I
purchased
an
album,
selected
my
finest
efforts,
and
printed
them
on
watermarked
pages,
still
hoping
to
create
a
work
that
"real."
Rainy
Day
Poetry
is
the
closest
that
I
have
come
so
far
to
a
truly
sophisticated
collection
of
my
writing.
My
parents
are
not
even
aware
that
this
portfolio
exists
and
only
a
few
of
my
closest
friends
have
been
permitted
to
gaze
upon
this
work.
Perhaps
I
keep
my
most
personal
writing
tucked
safely
away
from
public
scrutiny
because
it
reflects
most
closely
my
interior,
or
perhaps
I
am
afraid
that
something
I
consider
so
serious,
so
"real,"
will
become
a
joke
to
others.
Either
way,
I
finally
showed
my
parents
my
poetiy
when
it
was
published
in
the
Marquis.
They
responded
supportively,
toting
several
copies
out
of
Farinon
with
them
to
pass
around
to
my
family
members,
all
of
whom
seemed
a
little
shocked
by
the
content
and
a
little
hesitant
to
offer
much
commentary.
My
father
said
nothing,
but
on
my
mother's
dresser,
leaning
between
the
mirror
and
a
jewelry
box,
is
a
copy
of
the
thin
black
book.
Now,
as
this
assignment
forces
me
to
evaluate
my
history
as
a
writer,
I
face
a
few
patterns
that
have
persisted
from
grade
school
to
the
present
day.
As
a
shy
child
who
has
since
turned
into
a
shy
adult,
I
have
always
found
that
my
most
proficient
means
of
expression
and
of
communicating
with
others
is
through
writing.
Earlier
I
referred
to
writing
as
a
passion,
which
I
can
now
define
as
something
that
I
crave
in
my
life,
something
that
I
feel
is
an
intricate
part
of
who
I
am,
and
something
that
I
fear
may
never
become
what
I
have
imagined
deepest
within
my
heart.
Since
that
crude
birthday
present
for
my
brother
so
many
years
ago,
I
have
longed
to
create
writing
that
is-
not
merely
mine,
but
''real,"
able
to
inspire
another
by
connecting
our
experiences.
