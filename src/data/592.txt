Two
Skills
of
a
Successful
Writing
Conference
I
detest
writing
about
myself.
I
find
the
process
dull
and
vaguely
awkward
and,
as
such,
attempt
to
avoid
it
as
much
as
possible.
Luckily,
however,
a
literacy
narrative
of
my
history
as
a
WA
is
not
entirely
a
history
of
me,
but
also,
in
large
part,
a
history
of
my
student
partners.
As
much
as
IOve
attempted
to
show
them
about
the
art
of
writing,
I
aim
to
do
so
without
any
overt
Nteaching,O
so
that
the
student
really
learns
the
process
of
creating
good
writing,
instead
of
simply
Nspot
fixingO
points
that
IOd
circled,
without
picking
up
a
bigger
picture.
In
the
process,
however,
my
students
have
taught
me
more
about
the
process
of
understanding
writing
and,
moreover,
the
writing
process,
than
I
would
have
ever
grasped
on
my
own.
I
became
an
English
major
for
one
real
end:
to
learn
to
communicate
thoughts
through
words.
As
a
run-of-the-mill
English
student,
I
learned
to
write
passably
well
and
to
communicate
my
ideas
on
literature.
My
career
as
a
Writing
Associate,
however,
encourages
something
deeper.
Rather
than
acting
as
a
catalyst
for
my
developing
literary
criticism
skills,
it
forced
me
to
reflect
upon
the
thing
itself:
the
act
of
writing.
No
longer
would
it
suffice
to
have
an
intrinsic,
indescribable
feeling
or
NknowledgeO
of
how
writing
should
or
should
not
be.
In
its
stead,
I
was
required
to
learn
two
very
particular
skills.
The
first
skill
was
to
be
able
to
identify
the
sounds
of
writing
that
hitherto
had
been
just
feelings.
This
skill
was
as
basic
as
understanding
English
grammar,
the
use
of
which
IOd
never
had
to
consider
in
any
depth,
and
as
complex
as
subject
matter
and
organization.
Both
were
skills
that,
in
my
younger
years,
had
generally
only
been
made
light
of
when
something
was
incorrect.
As
a
result,
I
developed
an
intuition
for
the
sound
and
flow
of
writing
that
had
never
before
needed
to
be
verbalized.
As
a
Writing
Associate,
however,
it
was
not
just
enough
to
feel
that
something
should
be
changed;
I
had
to
know
what
and
why.
Pointing
out
grammar
flaws
here
or
there
would
not
help
the
student
develop
his
or
her
own
writing
techniques
if
I
could
not
explain
why.
As
I
first
read
over
studentsO
papers
before
conferences,
then,
I
was
forced
to
think
about
why
something
seemed
wrong
to
me,
and
how
I
would
be
able
to
explain
the
problem
to
the
student
when
he
or
she
asked
(inevitably,
they
always
ask).
While
this
helped
the
student
(I
hope!)
it
ended
up
helping
me
just
as
much.
In
developing
articulation
skills
about
the
writing
of
others,
I
was
also
developing
these
skills
for
my
own
writing.
Over
the
course
of
the
year,
I
found
flaws
in
my
own
writing
that
I
normally
would
not
have
caught,
but
having
had
to
verbalize
them
for
my
students,
had
worked
their
way
into
my
critiques
of
my
own
writing.
In
the
first
skill,
learning
to
identify
various
writing
techniques,
I
could
do
much
of
the
work
before
my
writing
conferences
began,
as
I
read
the
studentsO
papers.
The
second
skill
was
one
that
could
not
be
practiced
myself:
communicating
without
open
communication.
Belonging
to
the
College
Writing
Program
did
not
necessarily
train
me
to
do
this;
it
was
more
the
students
who
forced
me
to
learn
the
skill
myself.
While
articulation
was
very
helpful
for
identifying
problems
in
writing
for
myself,
it
did
not
necessarily
show
the
student
anything
useful
if
I
could
not
bring
the
student
to
understand
the
reasons
and
process
behind
my
critiques.
Similarly,
without
being
able
to
identify
and
verbalize
the
issues
I
had
with
various
pieces
of
writing,
I
would
not
have
been
able
to
ask
the
leading
questions
toward
any
particularly
helpful
end.
The
major
difference
between
being
a
Writing
Associate
and
an
English
tutor
is
in
learning
self-restraint.
A
Writing
AssociateOs
job
is
not
to
consistently
identify
problems
for
the
student
to
fix,
but
instead
to
help
the
student
learn
what
the
Writing
Associate
has
just
had
to
learn
himself
or
herself:
skill
number
one,
identifying
literary
techniques
and
ways
of
improvement,
and
then
learning
to
verbalize
them.
The
English
tutor
has
learned
to
verbalize
the
problem,
just
as
the
Writing
Associate
has,
and
so
has
no
issue
communicating
troubles
to
the
student
directly;
in
fact,
it
is
the
English
tutorOs
job
to
do
this
as
directly
and
clearly
as
possible.
In
contrast,
the
Writing
Associate
must
then
learn
an
additional
skill
that,
initially,
seems
entirely
antithetical
to
the
first
skill:
communicating
an
idea
without
communication.
As
the
first
skill
involves
learning
the
most
direct
and
simplest
way
of
figuring
out
a
problem,
the
second
involves
communicating
the
problem
without
using
any
of
those
newly
acquired
direct
tactics.
This
second
skill
was
taught
to
me
by
my
students.
One
particular
conference
stands
out
for
me
as
the
epitome
of
how
they
taught
me
to
communicate
this
way.
Two
students
had
come
to
meet
me
during
special
drop-in
hours
IOd
arranged
for
my
class.
My
first
reaction
was
frustration;
I
had
a
feeling
the
students
would
talk
to
each
other
during
the
entirety
of
the
meeting,
not
focusing
on
their
individual
papers
like
IOd
intended
them
to
do.
I
tried
to
hold
the
conference
nonetheless.
My
first
step
was
to
pose
questions
like
I
normally
would,
in
this
case
about
the
emotion
they
were
trying
to
evoke
with
the
piece
of
music
theyOd
created
together,
and
subsequently
written
separately
about.
The
beauty
of
this
situation,
however,
was
that
the
students
attempted
to
figure
out
responses
to
the
question
together.
Rather
than
thinking
about
the
question
and
answering
it
individually,
they
were
forced
to
talk
out
exactly
what
they
had
meant
by
their
creation.
For
me,
this
meant
that
I
got
to
see
the
mental
process
that
followed
from
a
simple
question.
Normally,
during
a
conference,
the
student
answers
in
pieces:
NI
wonder
ifEwell
maybe
I
should
write
itEoh,
I
see!O
The
Writing
Associate
sees
that
some
helpful
logical
process
has
taken
place,
but
is
often
enough
left
in
the
dark
about
what
exactly
has
gone
on
in
the
studentOs
head.
With
the
two
students
working
together,
they
verbalized
the
process
as
they
never
had
felt
the
need
to
do
individually
with
me.
They
could
not
assume
their
partner
already
knew
the
answer
to
the
leading
question
I
had
asked,
as
they
had
assumed
when
it
was
just
a
one-on-one
conference.
Instead
of
pieces
of
the
mental
process,
they
spoke
the
entire
progression
toward
their
final
response.
This
meant,
for
me,
that
I
could
weigh
the
reaction
of
all
of
my
questions
over
the
course
of
the
conference.
With
certain
questions,
the
students
would
look
at
each
other
in
consternation,
and
have
very
little
to
discuss,
while
other
questions
would
provoke
long
discussions
that
yielded
a
great
number
of
conclusions
excitedly
jotted
down
on
their
papers.
Through
this
process,
however,
I
had
very
little
input,
save
for
my
few
interjected
questions.
The
communication
between
the
students
and
myself
was
so
sparing,
and
yet
theyOd
managed
to
achieve
the
end
I
was
hoping
for:
improved
comprehension
of
the
purpose
of
their
papers,
achieved
through
their
own
discussion.
In
essence,
theyOd
figured
out
the
problems
IOd
found
in
their
papers,
without
my
ever
having
to
explicitly
tell
them
my
issues.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
is
a
guilty
process.
As
in
the
example
above
with
the
two
students
in
one
conference,
I
left
the
conference
feeling
that
I
had
contributed
nothing,
but
gained
everything.
In
general,
after
a
very
productive
conference,
I
often
feel
that
I
have
learned
a
great
deal
from
the
student,
but
not
contributed
very
much
myself.
However,
it
is
at
this
point
that
I
recall
the
WA
conferences
I
used
to
have
in
my
freshman
level
writing
classes.
The
conferences
that
I
took
the
most
away
from
were
those
where
I
was
taught
to
the
least
and
where
I
spoke
the
most.
I
figured
out
the
most
problems
and,
more
importantly,
remembered
the
most
about
the
conference
when
I
sat
back
down
to
my
paper
later.
Speaking
in
the
conference
made
me
more
inclined
to
take
my
own
notes
on
improvements
in
my
paper
and,
overall,
produced
the
most
benefit
for
my
writing.
While
there
are,
of
course,
always
students
who
are
loath
to
speak
at
all
in
a
conference,
I
have
had
many
conferences
in
which
I
am
utterly
unable
to
get
a
word
in
edgewise.
Generally,
those
conferences
will
start
out
with
me
saying
NWhat
would
you
like
to
talk
about?O
and
the
student
responding
with
a
steady
half
hour
stream
of
conscious
thoughts,
usually
with
little
further
prodding
from
me.
Most
often,
at
several
points
during
the
conference,
the
student
will
say
something
vital,
pause,
and
then
glance
at
me
for
confirmation.
The
most
useful
thing
I
can
do
at
that
point
is
to
suggest
that
the
student
make
a
note
of
the
revelation.
This
gives
the
student
confidence
in
his
or
her
thoughts,
and
also
forces
him
or
her
to
reflect
on
and
more
clearly
articulate
these
revelations.
These
conferences,
though
I
often
feel
useless
throughout,
appear
to
be
the
most
helpful
to
the
student
and,
in
the
long
run,
quite
helpful
to
me
as
well.
For
the
student,
these
conferences
give
him
or
her
confidence
in
his
or
her
ability
to
recognize
issues.
Moreover,
by
writing
them
down,
the
student
can
later
look
back
on
the
conference
notes
while
editing
the
paper
and
find
out
for
himself
or
herself
what
the
most
important
elements
of
the
conference
were,
and
what
issues
were
most
important
for
him
or
her
to
address
in
future
writing.
Moreover,
this
type
of
conference
helps
me
to
become
both
a
better
Writing
Associate
and
a
better
writer.
Watching
the
student
progress
through
a
long
series
of
thoughts
toward
what
he
or
she
already
knows
to
be
final
improvements
gives
me
insight
into
how
a
writer
thinks,
but
also
into
what
elements
were
most
useful
for
the
student.
If
itOs
a
second
or
third
conference
with
a
student,
he
or
she
will
commonly
mention
elements
discussed
in
earlier
conferences.
Because
of
this,
I
am
able
to
pick
up
what
elements
of
the
conference
were
most
helpful,
or
what
elements
most
stuck
with
the
student
for
future
writing
without
asking
the
student
to
outright
list
common
issues
in
his
or
her
own
writing.
In
the
scope
of
writing
conferences,
this
process
teaches
me
what
elements
of
my
conference
work
best
with
students,
but
in
the
long
run
shows
me
what
forms
of
communication
are
most
effective
for
comprehension
and
retention
in
any
situation.
It
seems,
then,
that
the
first
skill
of
articulation
is
used
primarily
for
teaching
the
Writing
Associate
the
end
to
be
achieved,
while
the
second
skill
is
used
for
teaching
the
student
that
same
end.
Together,
these
skills
combine
to
create
a
mutually
beneficial
writing
conference.
Despite
the
seeming
duality
of
these
skills,
however,
they
absolutely
overlap:
the
Writing
Associate
cannot
escape
learning
how
the
studentOs
mind
will
process
questions
and
respond
to
this
Nsilent
communicationO
while
the
student
will
pick
up
both
the
ability
to
recognize
opportunities
for
improvement
as
well
as
basic
writing
techniques.
Moreover,
as
in
the
conference
examples
above
where
the
student
speaks
for
the
entirety
of
the
writing
conference
with
very
little
prodding
from
the
Writing
Associate,
the
student
will
be
forced
to
articulate
what
would
otherwise
be
considered
intuitive
writing
basics.
Pushing
the
student
toward
solving
his
or
her
own
problems,
and
then
recording
their
solutions,
requires
both
the
Writing
Associate
and
the
partner
student
to
utilize
and
master
both
articulation
and
communication
skills,
and
does
so
in
an
extremely
easy
manner.
The
great
writing
conference
does
more
than
just
improve
a
paper.
Much
more.
A
great
conference
has
the
ability
to
teach
both
the
Writing
Associate
and
the
partner
student
how
to
recognize
places
for
improvement,
even
in
the
best
writing,
and
to
understand
and
articulate
the
reasons
for
the
improvements.
More
than
this,
though,
a
great
conference
will
teach
both
the
student
and
the
Writing
Associate
to
articulate
thoughts,
both
about
writing
and
further.
Moreover,
the
great
conference
teaches
a
subtlety
in
communication
that
carries
not
only
through
the
conference,
but
in
any
of
various
other
pursuits
that
require
a
deeper,
more
complex
level
of
communication.
