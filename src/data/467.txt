Me
as
a
Writer
My
first
encounter
with
letters
D
the
first
I
can
remember
D
happened
when
I
was
about
four
or
five
years
old.
My
father
used
to
read
me
bed-time
stories
almost
every
night.
And
those
readings
often
extended
into
the
next
morning
when
I,
curious
to
browse
through
the
illustrations
and
show
off
my
early
reading
skills,
slowly
dragged
my
finger
along
the
titles
of
the
stories.
Among
hundreds
of
black
little
characters,
the
red
and
often
very
short
titles
looked
particularly
inviting.
They
tempted
me
to
learn
how
to
read
and,
by
the
time
I
started
going
to
school,
I
was
much
ahead
of
everyone
else.
I
have,
however,
little
memory
of
my
first
writing
attempts.
Upon
my
first
year
in
primary
school,
I
already
knew
how
to
assemble
words.
In
class
I
worked
mostly
on
the
techniques
of
making
my
handwriting
presentable
and
sloped
to
the
right,
as
it
was
required.
No
grades
were
given
to
us
back
then.
But
the
mere
pleasure
of
copying
letters
and
words
was
an
incentive
sufficient
enough
for
me
to
start
my
career
at
school
as
a
conscientious
student.
In
fact,
all
until
the
secondary
school,
most
of
the
writing
I
did
was
either
copying
or
writing
down
what
the
teacher
was
dictating
to
the
class.
The
only
type
of
writing
that
required
a
bit
of
creativity
and
organization
was
the
notes
we
were
asked
to
take
for
our
summer
readings.
For
that
I
had
a
decorated
notebook
where
I
briefly
summarized
the
plots
of
the
stories
and
drew
their
main
characters.
Sometimes,
having
not
read
all
the
required
books,
I
was
pushed
to
do
something
more
spontaneous.
Thus,
in
the
notebook
I
also
described
extracurricular
activities
and,
for
the
first
time,
experimented
with
poetry.
I
was
always
grateful
to
my
first
Lithuanian
teachers
that
they
did
not
insist
on
us
to
just
summarize.
By
making
other
kinds
of
notes
and
records
I
learnt
to
keep
track
of
my
everyday
experiences
and
impressions,
which
eventually
encouraged
me
to
start
writing
a
diary.
Since
then,
my
diary
has
gone
through
many
stages.
While
making
records
of
different
events
in
my
life,
I
realized
how
writing
could
relieve
sadness
or
anger
and
how
it
could
clear
things
up.
At
one
point,
I
used
my
diary
primarily
to
save
wise
and
useful
quotations
from
any
literature
I
was
reading
at
the
time.
By
doing
that,
I
admired
other
writersO
choice
of
words
and
their
ability
to
put
the
essential
in
just
a
few
short
phrases.
I
often
read
and
reread
them
trying
to
find
out
how
the
authors
arrived
at
such
masterful
creations.
Then
at
some
point
I
switched
to
composing
narratives
in
the
form
of
letters,
either
addressed
to
friends,
family
or
simply
to
the
diary
itself.
I
think
it
was
the
stage
where
I
was
somewhat
too
old
to
ask
many
questions
but
yet
had
a
real
need
to
do
so.
This
eventually
led
me
to
a
lengthy
period
of
hand-writing
real
letters
to
my
closest
friends.
The
first
letters
were
a
bit
clumsy
and
quite
short.
First
of
all,
expressing
myself
in
words
and,
secondly,
revealing
feelings
and
thoughts
came
as
a
real
challenge
to
me.
That
is
why
initially,
together
with
one
of
my
classmates,
we
even
invented
our
own
script.
The
little
images
we
used
instead
of
regular
characters
held
meaning
only
to
the
two
of
us
and,
therefore,
allowed
more
freedom
towards
the
content.
The
way
my
friends
reacted
to
my
writings
had
always
mattered
much
more
to
me
than
any
assessment
of
a
teacher.
As
a
result,
I
put
great
effort
in
making
those
letters
coherent
and
meaningful.
I
strained
to
make
them
organized
and
presentable.
The
more
I
wrote,
the
longer
my
letters
became.
And
the
longer
became
the
list
of
friends
I
was
corresponding
with.
In
that
period
of
letter
writing
I
developed
an
odd
habit
to
write
in
capital
letters.
Why
I
needed
this
I
still
cannot
explain.
Perhaps
in
that
form
my
writing
looked
more
stable
and
aligned.
And
perhaps
I
thought
it
could
counterbalance
my
scattered
thoughts
and
interchanging
moods
spontaneously
flooded
onto
the
paper.
Capital
letters
also
might
have
filled
more
space
on
the
page
and
made
the
letters
seem
longer,
and
therefore
more
important
(although
I
do
not
know
how
much
of
a
reasonable
explanation
that
could
be).
Nowadays,
due
to
an
extensive
use
of
e-mail
and
other
online
discussions,
I
lean
towards
the
opposite
D
I
rarely
capitalize
even
the
first
words
of
the
sentence.
Most
often
I
do
it
unintentionally.
Other
times,
however,
the
flow
of
equal-sized
characters
somehow
seems
more
appropriate
for
intimate
writings,
as
if
taking
away
the
restrictions
and
the
formality
associated
with
proper
grammar
and
other
traditional
rules
or
expectations.
The
only
benefit
of
all
this,
I
suppose,
has
been
the
increasing
amounts
of
time
I
spent
on
writing
and
the
growing
comfort
and
satisfaction
I
attributed
to
it.
Unfortunately,
my
academic
writing
skills
seemed
to
be
restricted
to
exemplary
grammar
and
very
few
mistakes
of
style
or
logics.
That
was
sufficient
but
only
until
I
needed
to
write
argumentative
essays
or
analyses
of
literary
texts.
Those
types
of
writing
required
to
establish
a
thesis
and
provide
arguments
in
support
of
it.
At
first,
the
major
difficulty
I
faced
was
lack
of
ideas.
Or
so
it
seemed
back
then.
Now
I
would
say
I
was
too
ambitious
D
and
still
am
D
to
present
something
in
a
wisely
and
original
manner.
Instead
of
obediently
submitting
to
the
conventional
way
of
analyzing
the
text,
that
is
mentioning
and
explaining
the
most
important
parts
and
symbols
that
had
already
been
discussed
in
class,
I
always
tried
to
compose
something
of
my
own.
And
quite
naturally,
I
often
failed.
At
school,
literature
teachers
gave
us
three
grades
on
each
paper.
One
evaluated
the
grammar,
another
one
was
for
the
style,
and
the
third
one
was
for
the
content.
On
the
scale
from
one
as
the
lowest
to
ten
as
the
highest,
my
third
grade
hardly
rose
above
six
or
seven.
The
teacherOs
comments
at
the
end
of
the
paper
often
indicated
vague
arguments,
little
proof
and
too
much
summary.
Allegedly,
I
did
not
know
what
to
say,
and
this
arose
from
nothing
else
but
the
wish
to
be
original.
This
issue
of
originality
echoes
back
to
the
point
that
David
Bartholomae
made
in
his
essay,
NInventing
the
University,O
that
we
had
to
read
for
the
Writing
Associate
workshop.
There
is
little
space
in
early
stages
of
academic
writing
for
discoveries
and
sensational
ideas.
But
to
comply
with
repeating
the
obvious
seems
as
much
a
misdeed.
I
believe
this
conflict
between
me
as
an
independent
individual
different
from
everyone
else,
and
therefore
thinking
in
different
terms
than
the
others,
and
me
as
a
student
required
to
mimic
other
writers,
and
therefore
limited
to
putting
the
same
ideas
in
different
words,
has
always
been
an
obstacle
to
my
success
as
a
writer.
(Even
now
I
am
sitting
at
the
computer
trying
to
think
of
something
unique
to
say.
The
truth
is,
sometimes
there
is
very
little
that
is
unique
to
such
common
things
as
a
personOs
early
writing
history.)
Another
thing
that
possibly
chained
me
to
vague
writing
was
my
lack
of
experience
in
interpreting
the
text.
I
was
always
stubbornly
reluctant
to
agree
with
the
teachers
on
the
meanings
of
symbols
and
thought
them
to
be
too
exaggerated
or
oversimplified.
I
wanted
to
see
real
life
in
books,
where
nothing
could
be
weighed
to
mean
either
just
good
or
just
bad.
I
thought
nothing
could
be
judged
for
sure
and
all
decisions
could
vary
based
on
which
side
one
supported
more.
With
such
a
neutral
point
of
view,
I
could
not
make
a
strong
point.
I
tended
to
jump
from
one
side
to
the
other
as
if
afraid
that
the
point
of
view
I
chose
could
displease
the
teacher
and
affect
the
grade.
All
was
much
simpler
in
my
English
classes.
First
of
all,
for
English
we
never
read
complicated
prose
or
poetry
and
almost
never
had
to
write
papers
longer
than
one
double-spaced
page.
The
main
requirements
were
to
make
sense,
organize
the
text
according
to
the
given
model
and,
most
importantly,
to
incorporate
as
much
of
the
new
vocabulary
for
a
particular
subject
as
possible.
Quite
naturally,
with
such
guidelines,
I
always
did
well
on
these
essays.
I
still
tried
to
be
unique
in
using
complicated
words
and
phrases
but
the
effect
was
a
lot
less
disastrous
than
that
of
the
Lithuanian
text
interpretations.
Similarly,
it
was
always
easier
to
put
together
little
narratives
for
German
or
French
classes.
Although
my
knowledge
of
vocabulary
was
rather
poor
in
both
languages,
my
originality
showed
in
the
patience
and
stamina
I
put
into
sitting
at
the
dictionary
and
looking
for
fancier
words
instead
of
constructing
elementary
sentences.
It
required
painstaking
effort
but
I
seldom
gave
up.
It
also
consumed
enormous
amounts
of
time
(as
it
still
did
in
the
beginning
of
the
last
year
when
I
just
started
writing
real
college
papers
in
English)
and
prevented
me
from
sleeping
or
doing
other
homework.
But
it
often
paid
off
by
teaching
me
a
few
new
words
and
earning
me
a
good
grade
D
if
not
for
the
overall
result
than
at
least
for
the
effort.
Surprisingly,
the
overall
results
in
Lithuanian
started
improving
rapidly
as
soon
as
I
reached
the
eleventh
grade.
My
literature
teacher
could
do
nothing
else
but
express
her
elation
aloud
in
front
of
the
whole
class
when
my
essays
and
text
interpretations
suddenly
became
so
much
more
coherent
and
in-depth.
She
even
asked
me
to
participate
in
writing
competitions.
Just
in
that
one
year,
I
received
a
diploma
for
a
research
paper
on
the
image
of
trees
in
one
of
the
Lithuanian
writerOs
poetry
and
a
second
prize
award
in
a
creative
writing
competition,
which
earned
me
a
free
week-long
trip
to
the
Netherlands.
It
was
too
unexpected
and
too
overwhelming
for
me
to
realize
the
great
leap
I
just
made
across
those
shadowy
and
mysterious
fields
of
writing
that
I
had
struggled
with
for
so
long.
I
was
certainly
pleased
but
extremely
curious
to
know
how
and
why
this
had
happened.
Now,
when
I
look
back,
I
think
that
step
by
step
I
simply
learned
how
to
classify
things
and
themes
and
trained
my
eye
to
see
parallels
and
conflicts
between
them.
Along
with
academic
writing,
I
also
did
a
lot
of
poster
making
where
I
similarly
had
to
choose
D
and
highlight
very
clearly
D
the
most
relevant
information.
The
practice
of
how
to
do
so
helped
me
a
lot
when
I
had
to
write
my
yearly
report
as
a
school
president
and,
later
on,
a
lengthy
end
of
season
report
at
a
summer
camp
where
I
worked
as
a
Journalism
Counselor.
Although
reporting,
essentially
being
a
description
of
past
events,
was
not
such
a
great
challenge,
it
still
required
a
certain
amount
of
insight
and
analysis.
They
also
helped
me
realize
that
after
all
I
was
going
in
the
right
direction
D
with
every
other
piece
of
writing
the
work
gradually
grew
easier
and
more
interesting.
College
level
papers,
however,
emerged
as
another
slowdown
in
my
path
of
becoming
a
better
writer.
During
the
year
when
I
read
Political
Science
at
Vilnius
University,
no
professor
cared
much
about
the
fluency
of
our
narratives.
For
them,
it
was
important
to
see
that
we
had
researched
the
necessary
sources
and
applied
the
material
we
had
learnt.
They
placed
the
greatest
importance
on
plagiarism
and
how
to
avoid
it.
Therefore,
my
previous
practice
of
organizing
and
polishing
the
text
basically
lost
value.
To
write
a
decent
paper,
I
just
needed
to
quote
a
lot
of
other
books
(even
though
I
might
not
have
had
enough
knowledge
of
how
those
quotations
related
to
each
other).
I
also
spent
endless
nights
checking
whether
I
quoted
the
sources
correctly
and
did
not
mix
them
by
adding
more
footnotes.
Thus,
in
a
year,
when
the
news
came
that
I
got
accepted
to
Lafayette,
it
reached
me
as
a
relief
and
a
long-awaited
spark
of
hope.
I
wanted
to
start
everything
over
and
hoped
to
explore
a
more
individual
type
of
writing.
And
so
I
did.
Never
before
Lafayette
had
I
had
a
professor
that
would
read
three
drafts
before
collecting
the
final
version.
This
discipline
of
mandatory,
and
multiple,
revision
and
rewriting
has
taught
me
more
in
the
past
year
than
I
could
ever
expect.
Not
only
was
I
forced
to
improve
my
English
but
also
to
better
and
clearer
argue
for
any
point
I
was
trying
to
make.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
felt
a
necessity
and
found
the
courage
to
ask
someone
to
read
and
criticize
my
drafts.
In
fact,
last
year,
with
several
language
courses
each
semester,
the
WA
drop-in
service
often
found
a
place
among
the
several
stages
of
my
paper
writing.
Even
though
I
never
completely
adjusted
my
work
to
the
readersO
comments,
I
at
least
knew
how
the
reader
reacted
to
it.
In
the
words
of
Bartholomae,
I
could
probably
say
that
I
started
to
familiarize
myself
with
the
reader-based
type
of
writing.
I
still
find
it
very
difficult
to
construct
my
narrative
so
that
the
reader
could
easily
follow
the
course
of
my
thoughts.
Something
that
is
obvious
to
me
D
or
something
that
I
mention
but
do
not
stress
enough
D
often
creates
a
sense
of
a
vague
argument
and
leaves
the
reader
uncertain
of
what
I
am
trying
to
prove.
In
my
effort
to
be
concise
D
and
I
am
often
afraid
and
very
conscious
to
repeat
things
too
many
times
D
I
end
up
failing
to
communicate
my
message
to
the
readers.
It
is,
thus,
not
the
right
way
of
being
concise
and
actually
costs
me
a
lot
of
extra
time
for
revisions.
Consequently,
at
the
moment,
this
fear
of
repeating
myself
is
one
of
the
few
things
I
am
trying
to
improve
upon.
Perhaps
this
also
correlates
with
the
need
to
always
say
something
new
and
original.
Among
all
things,
it
certainly
reflects
the
fact
that
English
is
not
my
native
language.
Sometimes
I
simply
cannot
find
the
words
to
reiterate
or
explain
something
more
specifically.
I
can
only
hope
that,
like
previously,
skills
will
come
with
a
little
bit
more
practice.
