The
Evolution
of
my
Writing
I
began
last
fall
on
rather
unsteady
ground.
In
many
ways
I
was
more
nervous
when
I
returned
to
school
last
year
than
I
had
been
when
I
first
arrived
on
campus
as
a
freshman.
When
I
was
a
freshman
everything
was
new
to
me,
and
I
was
unsure
of
what
to
expect.
But
I
returned
to
school
last
year
after
a
having
a
successful
first
two
semesters
and
felt
a
tremendous
internal
pressure
to
continue
on
that
path.
In
addition,
my
anxiety
was
heightened
by
my
doubts
about
my
new
position
as
a
Writing
Associate.
This
mix
of
uncertainty
and
internal
pressure
led
to
a
fairly
stressful
late
August
of
1997.
I
laugh
when
I
remember
how
nervous
I
was
when
I
first
met
with
the
professor
I
was
WAing
for.
Throughout
our
meeting
he
asked
me
numerous
question
which
I
could
not
answer.
Finally
after
more
questions
than
I
could
bear,
I
told
him
that
I
had
no
idea
what
I
was
doing.
I
admitted
that
had
not
attended
the
training
session
yet
and
assured
him
that
01
may
understand
my
job
in
about
a
week.
When
I
left
our
meeting
I
was
half
convinced
that
my
professor
would
demand
a
new
writing
associate,
one
that
actually
understood
the
job
description,
and
that
I
would
be
out
of
the
job
before
I
even
looked
at
a
students
paper.
After
the
training
session
I
began
to
feel
a
little
more
confident,
not
really
because
I
felt
that
I
was
destined
to
be
a
great
WA,
but
because
most
of
the
other
first
year
Writing
Associates
seemed
to
feel
as
uncertain
as
me.
It
was
a
positive
day
because
I
was
able
to
hear
and
visualize
some
of
the
experiences
I
would
soon
be
encountering.
I
remember
leaving
the
meeting
with
a
boosted
level
of
confidence,
but
with
a
nagging
voice
still
demanding
to
know
exactly
what
I
would
experience.
In
the
week
that
followed
I
met
with
my
professor
once
again,
impressing
him
a
little
with
the
great
increase
of
knowledge
about
my
job
that
I
displayed.
I
also
visited
the
First
Year
Seminar
class
that
I
was
assigned
to.
Things
seemed
to
be
going
in
the
right
direction,
but
soon
I
realized
that
no
matter
how
well
I
was
trained,
nothing
could
truly
prepare
me
for
my
first
round
of
conferences.
I
agonized
over
each
paper,
spending
about
forty-five
minutes
to
an
hour
reading,
re-reading
and
formulating
a
conference
length
of
questions
for
each
one.
I
felt
adequately
prepared,
although
extremely
nervous,
when
my
first
set
of
students
walked
into
Pardee
319.
I
recognized
that
many
of
my
students
were
more
nervous
than
I
was
and
so
I
tried
to
make
them
feel
as
at
ease
as
possible.
The
conferences
began
fairly
poorly,
especially
when
I
realized
that
although
I
had
formulated
a
number
of
questions,
I
had
neglected
to
write
them
down
so
I
found
myself
struggling
to
remember
individual
aspects
of
each
paper.
But
soon
I
found
a
sort
of
rhythm
that
I
was
able
to
carry
over
to
the
rest
of
the
conferences
in
the
round.
After
the
round
ended
I
felt
proud
and
content
that
I
had
had
some
success
in
helping
to
improve
many
of
the
drafts.
In
successive
rounds
of
conferences,
my
confidence
continued
to
grow,
as
did
my
skill
as
a
Writing
Associate.
A
great
deal
of
this
improvement
had
to
do
with
the
constant
encouragement
of
the
professor
I
was
working
for.
I
also
found
my
personal
interest
in
the
subject
mater
to
be
beneficial.
By
the
final
round
of
conferences
it
was
gratifying
to
see
a
noticeable
improvement
from
the
first
round
in
some
of
the
students
papers.
A
few
who
had
struggled
with
organizing
ideas
had
begun
to
improve
in
that
direction
by
the
end
of
the
semester.
It
pleased
me
to
think
that
I
may
have
played
a
small
part
in
that
development.
On
the
other
side
of
things,
I
owe
much
praise
to
a
Writing
Associate
who
helped
me
to
develop
my
own
writing
throughout
the
semester.
I
enrolled
in
Introduction
to
Political
Theory
aware
of
the
rap
it
had
for
being
a
class
that
was
impossible
to
write
successfully
for,
but
was
not
expecting
it
to
be
as
hard
as
it
was.
I
wrote
three
completely
different
papers
for
the
first
assignment;
I
just
could
not
grasp
the
concept
of
a
political
theory
paper.
I
harassed
my
professor
with
questions
and
possible
thesis's,
and
spent
an
hour
with
my
WA.
After
our
meeting
I
had
my
own
drop
in
hours,
and
continued
to
annoy
her
by
testing
out
introductory
paragraphs
that
I
was
working
on.
The
approach
came
easier
on
successive
assignments,
although
it
still
remained
difficult.
I
continued
to
rely
on
my
WA
to
tear
my
first
draft
apart
and
help
me
find
the
kernels
of
relevant
ideas
that
may
have
been
inside.
I
am
grateful
to
her
for
being
such
an
active
Writing
Associate
and
for
helping
to
introduce
me
to
writing
in
a
new
type
of
way.
By
the
final
assignment
I
actually
enjoyed
writing
the
paper.
I
found
that
political
theory
papers
demanded
the
writer
to
be
extremely
creative
and
thorough,
providing
evidence
for
every
statement.
I
remember
being
extremely
proud
of
the
final
paper
that
I
handed
in,
because
I
knew
I
had
done
a
good
job
on
it
and
had
created
a
well
thought
out
argument.
That
sense
of
gratification
from
creating
a
paper
I
was
proud
of
alluded
me
in
another
class
I
was
taking.
Like
the
Political
Theory
course
I
was
taking,
I
had
signed
up
for
this
course
despite
warnings
from
peers
not
to
avoid
the
particular
professor
who
was
teaching
it.
Fortunately,
I
ignored
their
cautions
because
I
really
liked
the
way
the
professor
taught
the
course
and
I
learned
a
lot
from
it.
One
of
the
most
important
things
I
learned
was
that
my
own
writing
needs
a
great
deal
of
improving,
as
the
professor
made
clear
to
me
on
multiple
occasions.
I
agonized
over
the
first
assignment
for
that
paper,
which
was
a
four-page
paper.
I
revised
my
paper
over
and
over
until
I
was
getting
sick
of
looking
at
it.
More
than
anything
I
wanted
to
impress
the
professor
with
a
solid
paper,
but
as
a
result
of
my
over-revision
I
had
created
a
mediocre
work.
I
had
spent
too
much
time
wordsmithing
it,
so
that
it
had
lost
its
flow,
and
by
the
time
I
had
finished
I
was
unable
to
look
at
it
anymore.
When
I
got
the
paper
back,
the
professor
had
been
pleased
with
the
content,
but
not
about
the
writing
itself.
The
result
was
the
most
negative
feedback
I
had
ever
received
about
a
paper,
from
a
professor
whose
opinion
I
greatly
valued.
Although
I
knew
that
I
could
have
written
a
much
stronger
paper,
it
was
still
disheartening
to
read
some
of
the
comments.
There
was
a
larger
term
paper
due
at
the
end
of
the
semester
that
I
initially
planned
on
using
to
demonstrate
to
the
professor
that
I
was
a
decent
writer.
I
began
the
research
for
the
paper
fairly
early
on,
but
a
heavy
workload
prevented
me
from
starting
the
paper
itself.
I
had
four
term
papers
due
the
week
after
Thanksgiving
and
the
one
for
the
aforementioned
class
was
due
last.
This
caused
me
to
shift
my
priorities
as
and
I
could
not
write
the
paper
until
the
night
before
it
was
due.
I
stayed
up
all
night
trying
to
create
a
paper
I
was
satisfied
with,
but
by
that
point
in
the
week
I
was
burnt
out
from
writing.
As
a
result
I
once
again
handed
in
a
subpar
paper.
Again
this
paper
impressed
the
professor
with
its
content
and
arguments
but
he
was
displeased
the
writing.
He
offered
a
number
of
suggestions
to
strengthen
my
style
that
I
found
beneficial
but
a
number
of
things
he
focused
on
I
knew
I
would
have
corrected
if
I
had
not
written
it
at
the
last
moment.
This
marked
the
biggest
failure
I
have
had
at
college.
I
had
every
intention
of
producing
a
strong
paper
that
could
have
received
praise
from
the
professor,
but
was
unable
to
do
so.
I
was
upset
with
myself
for
not
planning
out
my
semester
better,
and
setting
up
the
scenario
of
not
being
able
to
devote
time
to
the
mechanics
of
my
paper.
I
still
wish
that
I
had
been
able
to
demonstrate
to
the
professor
that
I
am
a
better
writer
than
my
papers
indicated
but
I
guess
that
a
writer
is
only
as
good
as
their
papers.
In
the
spring
semester
I
was
convinced
that
I
would
not
permit
myself
to
hand
in
sub-par
papers
as
I
had
done
in
the
fall.
I
decided
that
I
would
attempt
to
get
an
earlier
start
on
term
papers
so
I
would
not
again
have
to
write
four
in
the
final
week
of
the
semester.
Because
of
the
structure
of
my
courses,
however,
I
only
had
two
term
papers
due
and
their
due
dates
were
a
week
and
a
half
apart.
Instead
of
the
longer
term
papers,
I
had
a
series
of
smaller
papers
for
most
of
my
courses.
I
once
again
had
a
Writing
Associate,
this
time
for
my
VAST,
but
her
ability
to
help
was
limited
because
of
the
nature
of
the
course.
I
met
with
her
only
once,
a
little
over
a
week
before
my
final
paper
was
due.
By
that
time
I
had
nearly
completed
the
paper
and
had
worked
closely
with
the
professor
fine
tuning
it.
The
assignment
was
such
that
each
individual
paper
was
unique
and
each
writer
needed
to
check
back
to
professor
regularly,
which
limited
the
Writing
Associates
role.
The
other
term
paper
I
wrote
was
for
a
statistics
course,
and
the
paper
did
not
allow
creativity
in
its
structure.
I
had
to
follow
an
established
format
to
introduce
the
project,
explain
the
data
I
had
gathered
and
extrapolate
on
its
importance.
This
paper
and
its
formulaic
structure
was
different
from
anything
I
had
previously
written
in
that
all
of
its
creativity
was
in
the
question
and
not
in
the
presentation.
It
forced
me
to
pay
especially
close
attention
to
detail,
as
I
had
to
persuade
the
reader
that
my
data
demonstrated
larger
social
trends.
As
a
Writing
Associate
my
task
in
the
spring
was
extremely
different
from
my
fall
assignment.
While
in
the
fall
my
freshman
students
were
too
scared
to
skip
meetings,
the
students
of
the
VAST
class
I
was
assigned
to,
were
not
required
by
the
professor
to
meet
with
me.
As
a
result,
most
of
the
students
in
the
class
never
visited
room
319.
After
my
first
round
of
conferences
in
which
16
people
signed
up
to
met
with
me,
but
only
6
people
actually
did,
I
demanded
that
only
people
who
were
serious
about
meeting
should
sign
up.
This
eliminated
some
of
the
no-shows,
but
I
often
still
found
myself
sitting
alone
in
the
room.
I
grew
disgruntled
with
these
no-shows
and
stopped
calling
them
to
see
if
they
wanted
to
reschedule.
I
figured
that
if
they
truly
wanted
a
meeting
they
would
call
me.
The
no-shows
did
give
me
plenty
of
time
to
do
homework,
however.
The
independence
that
the
professor
granted
his
class
left
me
fairly
helpless
against
some
student's
questions.
The
professor
had
merely
told
me
and
the
WA
that
I
was
working
with
that
he
wanted
good
papers
,
but
had
said
nothing
more
specific.
His
assignments
were
extremely
open-ended
and
gave
no
real
direction;
he
would
accept
everything
from
a
traditional
research
paper,
to
a
creative
story,
to
a
movie.
On
the
flip
side,
students
who
met
with
me
tended
to
be
enthused
about
their
papers
and
seriously
wanted
to
improve
them.
This
made
for
some
great
experiences;
I
remember
I
met
with
one
student
for
over
an
hour
on
possible
directions
for
her
to
take
a
paper
on
stereotyping
in
print
advertisements,
despite
the
fact
that
she
had
not
begun
writing
a
draft
yet.
I
also
learned
that
I
really
liked
to
read
and
respond
to
papers
when
the
student
was
there,
as
opposed
to
reading
and
planning
out
the
conferences
when
I
was
at
home,
because
it
allowed
me
to
question
things
as
I
encountered
them.
This
seemed
to
create
a
natural
flow
to
the
conference.
I
do
not
know
yet
how
I
will
approach
conferences
this
coming
semester.
I
guess
I
will
do
it
whichever
way
the
professor
feels
is
most
appropriate.
I
am
working
with
the
same
professor
and
the
same
First
Year
Seminar
that
I
did
last
fall,
so
I
may
return
to
reading
and
planning
out
conferences
while
at
home,
since
that
maybe
the
best
approach
for
a
freshman
class.
Regardless,
I
feel
a
lot
more
comfortable
with
my
position
then
I
did
a
year
ago,
and
I
am
looking
forward
to
the
start
of
the
semester.
However,
I
am
not
excited
about
the
prospect
of
writing
more
term
papers.
