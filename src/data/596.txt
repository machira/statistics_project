Literacy
Narrative
Since
I
wrote
my
first
literacy
narrative
one
year
ago,
I,
as
a
person
and
a
writer,
have
changed
in
many
ways.
In
the
fall
semester,
I
had
my
first
taste
of
being
a
Writing
Associate
for
a
First
Year
Seminar.
As
a
WA,
I
learned
how
to
successfully
communicate
with
others
about
their
writing,
and
at
the
same
time,
I
developed
trust
with
other
Lafayette
students.
By
the
end
of
the
semester,
I
sat
at
a
table
sampling
Latin
foods
with
my
student
writers
and
discussing
winter
breaks,
basketball
seasons,
and
finals.
The
spring
semester
brought
about
an
entirely
new
set
of
experiences.
I
traveled
to
Galway,
Ireland
where
I
studied
at
a
large
international
university.
A
new
culture,
people,
land,
and
academics
proved
to
be
a
constant
adjustment
for
someone
who
had
never
left
the
United
States.
At
the
same
time,
my
writing
underwent
a
change.
It
was
an
unconscious
change
at
the
time;
as
I
adapted
to
my
surroundings,
so
too,
did
my
writing.
Over
the
past
year,
my
writing
has
not
changed
because
I
have
forced
it
to
change,
but
it
has
transformed
as
I
have
encountered
new
people,
environments,
and
surroundings.
In
early
September
as
I
waited
for
the
first
meeting
with
one
of
my
student
writers,
I
was
anxious
and
excited
at
the
same
time.
With
my
student
writerOs
paper
in
front
of
me,
I
ran
through
about
a
thousand
ways
of
saying
hello
and
re-introducing
myself
since
the
initial
meeting
with
the
entire
class.
I
reminded
myself
of
my
new
authority
as
a
WA.
I
told
myself
that
I
had
showcased
my
own
merit
as
a
writer
to
professors,
my
fellow
WAs,
and
other
students.
The
continuous
improvements
that
my
writing
had
undergone
throughout
my
life
had
to
give
me
confidence
to
provide
others
with
advice
on
their
writing.
As
I
just
started
with
a
simple,
NHelloO
and
NHow
are
you?,O
the
conference
progressed
smoothly.
I
went
over
forming
a
thesis
and
the
importance
of
the
flow
of
a
paper.
The
student
write
responded
positively
to
my
comments
and
discussed
difficulties
that
she
encountered
as
she
constructed
her
paper.
As
I
concluded
the
meeting,
she
thanked
me
for
all
my
help,
and
I
felt
a
satisfying
feeling
for
helping
someone
with
her
first
college
paper.
As
my
first
round
of
conferences
ended,
I
was
filled
with
mixed
emotions.
Many
of
my
student
writers
had
expressed
countless
thanks
for
my
advice,
while
others
had
failed
to
show
up
for
their
conferences.
As
I
spoke
with
the
professor
of
the
First
Year
Seminar,
I
discussed
what
I
had
gone
over
with
the
student
writers
and
some
of
the
issues
that
I
had
faced
contacting
and
meeting
with
a
few
of
the
students.
I
learned
that
I
had
to
come
up
with
clear
cut
set
of
rules
regarding
missed
conferences.
The
professor
also
provided
me
with
a
better
idea
of
what
he
was
looking
for
from
the
fifteen
freshmen
in
his
class.
Meeting
each
week
with
my
fellow
WAs
and
Professor
Tatu,
I
learned
how
to
interact
effectively
with
my
student
writers,
ask
the
right
questions,
and
deal
with
any
situations
that
arose
on
a
day-to-day
basis.
In
addition,
other
WAs
discussed
their
concerns
and
triumphs
each
meeting.
I
saw
as
each
week
passed
that
I
encountered
the
same
issues
that
my
fellow
WAs
had
faced
including
missed
conferences,
unclear
assignments,
and
indifferent
student
writers.
More
importantly,
though,
I
believe
that
my
fellow
WAs
and
I
realized
how
to
respond
to
our
student
writersO
adamancy
about
their
writing
and
ways
of
approaching
assignments.
As
the
semester
continued,
I
also
found
how
to
respond
to
my
own
convictions
about
my
writing.
I
realized
the
need
to
look
at
my
writing
in
a
more
objective
way-
as
I
had
for
my
student
writers.
The
emotions
that
I
attached
to
a
paper
that
I
stayed
up
till
2
oOclock
in
the
morning
had
to
be
pushed
aside
in
order
to
make
my
paper
better.
I
took
two
history
classes
that
I
enjoyed,
yet
I
had
significant
amounts
of
writing
to
do
for
both
of
them
in
short
periods
of
time.
I
was
not
facing
a
new
discipline
or
a
significant
writing
challenge.
Instead,
I
was
forced
to
complete
assignments
in
short
periods
of
time
on
top
of
other
class
work
and
extracurricular
commitments.
In
my
last
literacy
narrative,
I
wrote
of
my
difficulty
of
sitting
in
front
of
a
blank
screen
and
taking
hours
and
hours
to
complete
short
essays.
The
fall
2007
semester,
though,
I
had
to
just
start
writing.
Every
idea
about
Napoleon,
the
Marquis
de
Lafayette,
and
the
French
Revolution
were
immediately
entered
onto
my
Microsoft
Word
document.
I
learned
that
no
idea
was
a
bad
idea,
and
by
writing
them
down
as
they
came
to
me,
I
was
able
to
see
the
best
ones.
Thus,
it
was
during
this
semester
that
I
finally
learned
how
to
write
without
procrastinating
My
own
growth
as
a
writer
during
the
fall
semester
stemmed
not
only
from
my
busy
schedule.
I
believe
that
it
was
due
in
large
part
because
of
my
experiences
as
a
WA.
Several
of
my
student
writers
had
expressed
their
own
difficulty
sitting
in
front
of
a
computer
screen
with
their
prompt
in
front
of
them.
Telling
them
to
jot
down
ideas,
complete
drafts,
and
revise,
I
found
myself
questioning
why
I
didnOt
take
my
own
advice.
In
addition,
I
would
circle
unclear
sentences
in
their
papers
and/or
pose
questions
to
their
claims.
I,
too,
had
to
ask
certain
questions
about
my
own
writing.
I,
too,
had
to
look
at
my
paper
for
clarity
and
cohesiveness.
In
addition,
throughout
the
semester,
the
professor
of
the
class
I
WAed
for
had
expressed
his
desire
to
hear
the
NvoicesO
and
opinions
of
his
student
writers.
Consequently,
I
told
the
student
writers
to
inject
more
of
themselves
into
papers
about
Latino
writers
and
characters
who
faced
a
series
of
obstacles
and
triumphs.
Taking
my
own
advice,
I
began
to
become
more
successful
at
writing
my
own
thoughts
on
history
books
and
articles.
As
a
result,
I
received
positive
feedback
from
my
history
professor
on
my
personal
reaction
papers.
During
the
second
set
of
conferences
with
my
student
writers,
I
had
gained
confidence
in
my
ability
as
a
WA-
a
facilitator
of
the
writing
process.
I
could
tell
as
well
that
my
student
writers
felt
they
could
tell
me
any
difficulty
they
had
with
their
writing.
One
student
told
me
of
how
much
trouble
she
had
writing
about
her
own
feelings.
She
also
discussed
how
one
teacher
in
high
school
had
trained
her
to
write
in
a
certain
way.
I
had
to
help
her
work
through
rules
about
grammar,
theses,
and
introductory
paragraphs
that
she
believed
should
never
be
broken
and
those
rules
that
she
could
bend
to
make
her
paper
stronger.
In
addition
to
allowing
me
to
help
them
with
their
writing,
my
student
writers
trusted
me
with
the
questions,
thoughts,
and
stresses
that
they
faced.
Students
would
tell
me
how
their
football
games
went
or
how
they
did
at
their
first
track
meets.
At
the
end
of
one
conference,
one
student
asked
me
about
a
situation
he
face
in
one
of
his
classes
and
my
opinion
on
how
to
approach
the
situation.
Another
student
asked
for
my
thoughts
on
classes
to
take
at
Lafayette
and
the
process
of
declaring
a
major.
Each
time
I
met
with
my
student
writers,
they
felt
more
comfortable
discussing
their
feelings
about
class,
writing,
and
Lafayette
College.
My
confidences
as
a
WA
reached
a
high
point
by
the
end
of
the
semester.
Since
my
nervousness
before
my
first
conference,
I
now
believed
that
I
had
successfully
aided
my
student
writers
in
their
quest
to
become
better
writers.
With
finals
approaching,
I
was
busy
with
several
final
papers
and
assignments.
This
time,
though,
the
tasks
seemed
less
daunting.
Time-management
allowed
me
to
take
the
time
to
write
my
history
papers
with
precision.
After
a
few
weeks
at
home
for
the
holidays,
I
embarked
on
my
first
transatlantic
flight.
Galway,
Ireland
became
my
home
for
the
four
and
a
half
months
that
followed.
My
time
as
an
official
Writing
Associate
was
put
on
hold
as
I
learned
to
adapt
to
taking
six
classes
in
a
foreign
country.
I
took
three
economics
and
business
courses
and
three
history
courses.
The
differences
in
my
courses,
professors,
college,
town,
and
country
were
numerous.
Rather
than
small
classes
of
twenty
or
thirty,
I
encountered
an
Econometrics
class
with
over
one
hundred
and
fifty
people.
Students
filled
every
seat
in
a
large
lecture
hall
for
my
NProblems
in
the
History
of
Ireland:
1580-1700O
class.
While
professors
made
themselves
available
for
questions,
the
time
spent
with
them
was
minimal
compared
to
Lafayette.
The
grading
system
was
also
entirely
different
at
the
National
University
of
Ireland
at
Galway.
Rather
than
daily
and/or
weekly
assignments,
midterm
essays
and/or
final
examinations
accounted
for
my
entire
grade.
Keeping
up
with
readings
and
day-to-day
topics
was
entirely
on
me,
and
I
often
found
myself
missing
my
Lafayette
education.
Yet,
at
the
same
time,
I
built
on
the
discipline
that
I
had
learned
in
the
fall
semester
at
Lafayette.
I
had
to
manage
my
time
between
homework,
traveling,
and
other
events.
The
distractions
of
living
with
foreign
students
and
the
different
way
of
life
were
also
part
of
the
mix.
While
writing
my
three
history
midterms,
I
encountered
another
new
challenge
at
NUIG.
In
Ireland
and
most
of
Europe,
students
do
not
have
textbooks
for
every
class.
Instead,
students
photocopy
pages
from
textbooks
that
are
held
at
the
university
library.
The
problem
is
that
there
are
around
four
main
textbooks
for
a
hundred
students.
When
writing
papers,
it
is
much
worse.
Essay
topics
and
due
dates
are
the
same
for
all
these
students
so
each
person
must
time
when
he/she
can
photocopy
their
sources.
The
lack
of
accessibility
to
sources
and
computers
is
rarely
an
issue
at
Lafayette.
With
this
in
mind,
I
often
went
to
the
library
as
it
opened
to
photocopy
any
materials
I
needed.
Despite
this,
though,
certain
books
I
needed
werenOt
available.
I
sifted
through
those
pages
I
photocopied
and
also
highlighted
and
took
notes.
Collecting
the
necessary
materials
and
having
enough
information
to
formulate
was
difficult.
I
wrote
a
paper
on
the
Franco-Prussian
War
for
my
German
history
class,
and
I
was
scrapping
to
get
to
the
needed
word
count.
While
at
the
time
I
was
frustrated,
I
now
realize
that
there
was
good
that
came
out
of
these
writing
experiences.
My
papers
became
more
analytical
because
I
was
forced
to
think
of
each
piece
of
information
I
had.
In
history
papers,
I
had
tended
to
write
too
many
facts.
Yet,
after
studying
in
Ireland,
I
learned
to
think
of
the
implications
of
certain
events
during
history.
I
could
figure
out
why
a
general
executed
a
certain
tactical
move
or
the
social
and
political
implications
of
propaganda.
I
also
learned
important
lessons
in
my
three
economics
classes.
In
my
Econometrics
class,
I
worked
in
a
group
to
complete
an
econometric
model.
With
the
timing
of
spring
break,
traveling,
and
lack
of
accessibility
to
computers,
I
was
once
again
frustrated.
My
group
lost
part
of
our
project
and
had
to
decide
on
how
to
meet
our
deadline.
With
these
events
occurring,
I
had
to
write
several
pages
discussing
the
findings
of
our
model.
I
wrote
what
came
to
mind
concerning
what
data
I
had,
consulted
other
group
members,
and
did
necessary
revisions.
Keeping
my
cool
under
pressure
proved
to
be
a
valuable
skill,
and
my
group
and
I
completed
the
project
by
the
due
date.
My
confidence
increased
with
that
project
when
I
realized
how
my
writing
skills
had
helped
me
to
successfully
communicate
our
findings
in
a
timely
manner.
By
the
end
of
the
semester,
I
had
become
accustomed
to
the
aforementioned
issues
and
planned
my
days
accordingly.
I
completed
two
final
papers
and
took
four
finals
in
order
to
complete
my
courses
in
Ireland.
While
I
was
extremely
nervous
for
my
finals,
I
took
the
patience
that
I
had
learned
throughout
the
semester
into
the
exam
rooms.
My
NUIG
experience
ended
on
May
14th
with
the
completion
of
my
Econometrics
exam,
and
I
realized
that
my
writing
was
forever
changed.
One
year
after
completing
my
first
literacy
narrative,
I
find
that
my
writing
has
transformed
after
my
experience
as
a
WA
and
my
time
abroad.
My
first
semester
as
a
WA
was
a
learning
experience
for
me
as
I
discovered
how
to
interact
with
my
student
writers.
While
I
gave
them
advice
on
the
writing
process,
I
realized
that
it
was
important
to
heed
my
own
advice.
Time
management
and
injecting
my
own
opinion
into
my
writing
were
two
of
these
important
notions.
Studying
abroad
in
Galway,
my
writing
was
put
to
the
test
as
I
battled
source
accessibility,
time
crunches,
and
different
university
system.
I
had
to
time
my
day
around
finding
sources,
write
efficiently,
and
support
my
argument
with
less
then
optimal
sources.
Grading
was
entirely
different
as
professors
had
different
criterion
and
only
one
to
two
grades
per
students.
Despite
these
obstacles,
my
time
in
Ireland
was
well
spent,
and
I
transitioned
to
write
in
a
different
environment.
A
year
after
my
first
literacy
narrative,
I
find
that
the
experiences
IOve
had
and
the
people
IOve
come
into
contact
with,
have
given
me
the
confidence
to
discuss
my
writing
career,
and
more
importantly,
myself
and
my
opinions
on
paper.
As
I
start
my
second
semester
as
a
WA,
I
hope
that
all
I
have
learned
continues
to
serve
me
during
conferences
and
in
my
own
writing.
