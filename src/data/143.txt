what
makes
a
writer
take
to
her
pen?
is
it
the
promise
of
hair,
love,
truth
undone
the
promise
of
inner
peace
a
marathon
race
away
from
pain
and
heartache?
-me
This
is
the
story.
I
write
because
I
have
to--I've
been
writing
so
long
that
it's
in
my
blood.
When
I
don't
write,
particularly
poems,
I
feel
awful.
This
is
what
I've
learned
over
the
past
year.
This
has
probably
been
one
of
the
most
productive
and
versatile
years
for
me
in
terms
of
my
writing.
I
have
written
articles
for
grassroots
newspapers,
I
mean,
pieces
that
shouted
opinions
through
thin
gray
paper
to
those
willing
to
pay
$1
for
low-income
urban
knowledge.
I've
written
press
releases,
radio
advertisements,
and
theatre
program
book
notes
as
part
of
an
internship
I
did
at
Venture
Theatre
in
Philadelphia
last
semester.
I've
written
and
revised
poems
to
be
read
on
paper
and
aloud.
I've
written
speeches
and
criticism
of
novels
and
films
and
speakers.
I
feel
like
I've
done
alot
and
because
of
all
of
it,
writing
has
become
integral
to
my
world--an
everday
function.
Being
a
WA,
experiencing
all
of
the
writing
opportunities
I
have
had
over
the
past
year,
has
taught
me
that
writing
is
a
full-time
thing
for
me
and
I
like
it
that
way.
Not
only
that,
but
I
feel
as
though
my
writing
gives
me
another
voice
though
which
to
communicate
with
others.
If
you
want
to
talk
to
someone
who
believes
in
the
power
of
the
written
word,
talk
to
me.
There's
nothing
like
sitting
down
and
reading
a
book,
picking
up
a
glossy-covered
magazine,
or
sifting
through
cumbersome
newspaper
pages.
Even
though
I
may
be
one
of
the
first
to
say,
put
in
on
the
Web,
I
still
hold
old-fashioned
views
that
writing
on
paper
is
revolutionary
and
has
made
me
so.
I
feel
like
I
am
cheating
the
Universe
when
I
don't
write.
Last
year,
for
this
same
assignment,
I
wrote
that
when
I
live,
do
all
the
things
that
incorporate
life--y'know,
take
showers,
ride
the
subway,
eat
an
orange,
I
feel
as
though
I
am
drawing
energy
from
the
world.
When
I
can't
transform
that
into
words,
poems,
offerings
in
a
way,
I
feel
as
though
I
am
a
parasite,
and
not
carrying
my
full
weight.
My
great-grandmother
had
faith
that
I
would
use
my
writing
ability
to
change
things
that
were
wrong
in
the
world.
So,
I
give
back,
and
giving
back,
I
believe,
is
making
change.
You
know
the
slogan,
each
one,
reach
one,
teach
one.
That
said,
I
can
describe
my
progress
and
growth
as
a
writer
over
the
past
year
as
one
of
finding
that
sense
of
purpose.
My
past
fall
semester
as
a
WA,
I
helped
other
students
to
discover
some
of
their
talents
as
a
writer
and
encouraged
them
to
find
their
own
style.
What
was
my
style?,
I
asked
myself,
and
is
my
writing
ability
and
skill
only
to
be
used
to
teach
others
how
to
write?
I
desperately
wanted
to
find
some
way
to
affect
people
through
written
words
and
to
live
off
and
love
what
I
was
doing.
As
a
first
semester
junior,
I,
who
is
always
a
person
looking
at
the
future,
was
thinking
about
what
I
would
do
after
college.
English
professor"
was
one
occupation
that
I
pondered,
and
people
thought
I
would
be
good
at
it.
My
job
as
a
WA
encouraged
it
because
I
was
constantly
helping
people
to
understand
and
formulate
arguments,
sometimes
helping
them
to
analyzing
text
and
put
that
interpretation
into
writing.
Meanwhile,
I
was
trying
to
understand
how
students'
minds
worked.
Although
my
first
experiences
as
a
WA
helped
me
to
develop
as
a
writer,
meaning
it
gave
me
the
skills
to
revise
my
work
and
make
it
more
coherent,
I
can't
say
it
did
in
this
instance.
This
time,
it
helped
to
develop
me
as
a
reader
of
other's
interpretation
and
use
of
the
English
language.
I
realized
that
all
people
write
out
of
their
own
perception
and
intention
of
understanding.
Therefore,
my
experience
as
a
WA
taught
me
what
I
didn't
want
to
be
just
a
reader
of
text,
but
more
a
reader
of
a
person's
experience
of
reading
text.
I
guess
I've
tried
to
become
a
psychologist
of
the
way
people
read.
I
think
it's
important
for
writers
to
do
this,
y'know,
to
understand
how
they
are
being
read,
how
their
words
are
affecting
people,
emotionally,
mentally,
maybe
physically.
Working
on
publications
and
doing
journalism
internships
has
allowed
me
to
compare
the
process
that
editors
go
through
laying
out
pages
with
writing
something.
Laying
out
a
newspaper
is
a
matter
of
knowing
where
people's
eyes
are
going
to
drift
first
and
putting
the
lead
story
there
or
something
else
you
definitely
want
them
to
see.
It's
also
knowing
that
a
lot
of
us
are
trained"
readers
of
newspapers
and
magazines.
We
like
our
table
of
contents
in
the
front,
or
our
lead
story
in
the
middle
or
on
the
front
page.
We
like
our
horoscopes
somewhere
near
the
end.
Writing
a
poem
or
article
is
very
much
the
same
process
for
me.
I
try
to
lay
out
a
poem,
with
emphasis
first
on
my
own
feelings,
and
then
in
a
way
that
I
know
people
will
feel
what
I
am
trying
to
say.
I
want
people
to
understand
what
I
write
and
the
emotion
behind
it,
because
it's
there.
I
want
them
to
take
away
something
from
it,
and
if
I
can
facilitate
that
process,
I'm
glad
to
do
it.
I
feel
as
though
in
the
past
year,
I've
been
learning
to
write
from
meeting
with
people,
talking
with
them,
and
trying
to
understand
what
makes
them
want
to
live.
My
writing,
mostly
work
I've
done
for
pleasure,
has
developed
into
some
form
of
creative
journalism.
I've
tried
to
regain
a
heritage
of
sorts
I
learned
as
a
young
poet,
reading
Langston
Hughes'
dialect
poems.
As
a
younger
poet,
reading
what
I
guess
folks
would
call
Ebonics,
in
his
poems,
at
the
same
time,
struggling
with
my
identity
as
a
Black
person,
I
was
embarassed
and
even
ashamed.
All
the
mammies
and
gits
and
y'alls
,
even
though
I
spoke
that
way
due
to
my
Southern
family
roots,
didn't
seem
like
literature,
even
worthy
of
being
read.
Over
the
years,
however,
I
have
embraced
the
dialect,
as
did
writers
like
Zora
Neale
Hurston,
who
believed
it
was
beautiful
and
spiritual,
of
true
folk
essence.
Raw.
That's
why
I
love
it
and
cherish
it
so.
It
is
a
part
of
me.
So,
my
writing,
for
grassroots
publications
in
Philadelphia
and
writing
poems
to
be
read
at
readings
in
art
galleries
and
hip
hop
cafes,
has
been
a
concrete
struggle
between
writing
how
I
speak
and
how
I
have
learned
to
write
for
English
classes.
It
is
a
battle
that
is
hard-won
but
I
realize,
that
for
myself,
the
spoken
word
type
of
writing
will
always
prevail.
I
try
to
convey
this
to
students
in
my
last
semester
as
WA,
by
telling
them
to
find
some
way
to
make
their
voices
known
within
the
structure
of
papers
that
professors
want,
I
tell
them
that
is
a
challenge
to
make
each
paper
seem
like
your
work
and
not
a
model
or
copy
of
the
right
paper
that
may
be
in
the
professor's
mind.
I've
learned
that
it
is
important
to
take
risks
in
writing
papers.
Especially
in
regards
to
my
opinion,
which
because
of
my
journalistic
slant,
shines
through
in
whatever
I
produce.
I
tell
the
students
I
WA
to
take
risks
because
sometimes
you
learn
the
most
from
them.
Maybe
you
shouldn't
start
of
the
introductory
paragraph
with
background
information
(unless
specifically
told
by
a
professor
to
do
so).
Maybe
your
introduction
will
be
a
scenario,
a
story
you
set
up
for
comparison.
I
also
have
learned
through
my
experience
as
a
writer,
writing
at
and
for
Lafayette
and
away
(sometimes
against
it)
that
the
process,
not
so
much
the
writing,
but
the
thinking,
is
extremely
important.
I
think
it
is
important
to
know
your
process
like
you
know
what
foods
you
do
or
don't
like.
Many
of
the
students
I
have
helped
didn't
know
how
they
came
up
with
their
ideas--how
they
could
make
themselves
comfortable
to
write
a
paper.
Some
thought
that
they
had
to
do
their
rough
drafts
on
the
computer--as
if
longhand
was
not
college-esque.
I
felt
it
important
in
my
experience
as
a
WA,
to
inform
students
that
sometimes
within
structure
and
requirement
there
is
room
for
originality
and
individual
preference.
It's
just
a
matter
of
taking
the
risk.
Maybe
risk
isn't
a
word
that
the
WA
program
would
put
in
its
purpose
or
mission
statement,
but
I
believe
in
it.
Upon
reading
the
write-up
for
this
semester,
I
felt
as
though
the
term,
writer,
in
an
occupational
sense,
will
not
necessarily
apply
to
every
WA
in
the
program
this
year
after
leaving
Lafayette.
Some
of
us
are
writers
for
our
college
experience
and
after
we
graduate
we
become
engineers
or
businesspeople,
or
doctors.
Not
to
say
that
everyone
doesn't
have
a
writer
inside
them,
but
it
will
not
be
everyone's
life
focus.
And
rightfully
so,
for
some,
I
think.
Being
a
writer
is
no
joke.
Particular
a
creative-writing
writer.
There's
no
money
it
and
only
fragile
hopes
of
fame
and
fortune.
If
you
want
to
be
a
writer,
I
have
learned,
you
have
to
love
it,
really
love
it,
just
like
people
who
want
to
teach
children,
have
to
love
it
with
all
their
being
in
order
to
deal
with
all
the
stress
and
strife.
Over
the
past
semester,
I
have
met
people
who
are
starving
and
scraping
because
they
are
writers.
People
in
poetry
readings
on
Friday
night,
while
their
peers
are
out
at
the
movies
or
scoping
out
the
opposite
or
same
sex,
cruising
down
South
Street.
I've
met
people
who
believe
in
writing,
who
believe
in
writing
articles
for
papers
for
free,
who
believe
in
writing
poems
on
the
subway
because
they
believe
it
will
speak
to
the
masses
and
motivate
them.
I've
seen
revolutions
planned
with
the
speaking
of
poetry
in
Illadelph
cafes,
where
there
was
no
coffee,
no
cigarette
smoke,
just
the
real
deal
of
artists,
writing
for
change
and
hope
and
peace
of
mind.
More
than
anything
else
I
have
learned
this
past
year,
I
have
learned
this:
that
writing
is
a
revolutionary
act.
I
don't
allow
people
in
politics
or
health
fields
to
tell
me
that
I
am
not
on
the
front
lines,
that
I
am
not
packing
a
big
enough
weapon.
Change
needs
more
than
one
voice
and
not
all
people
can
hear.......
