How
I
Learned
to
Love
the
Otter
Writing
is
first
and
foremost,
something
that
must
be
beyond
the
writer.
A
writer,
after
all,
is
writing
for
an
audience.
Whether
that
intended
audience
is
meant
to
hate
or
love
the
material,
it
is
inconsequential
when
thinking
of
the
lasting
effect
of
either
reaction
on
the
reader.
In
this
sense
you
could
call
effective
writing
laconic
in
that
its
intent
is
to
transcend
the
length
of
the
work.
To
say
that
the
importance
of
a
written
work
is
in
Nwhat
is
not
saidO
is
too
easy,
because
the
implicative
sense
of
meaning
which
a
reader
extrapolates
from
a
reading
is
directly
connected
to
what
that
writer
has
put
on
the
page.
Whether
intentionally
personal
or
not,
the
written
work
of
a
person
is
something
which
has
been
born
of
them
and
has
the
ability
to
shed
light
on
the
pedagogy
of
that
person.
I
donOt
know
when
I
actually
began
writing
as
a
writer.
Of
course
I
had
written
terse
anecdotes
about
sheep
and
hamsters
finding
treasure
in
places
like
a
bus
stop
or
a
supermarket
when
I
was
very
young,
but
I
canOt
say
exactly
when
I
became
a
writer.
At
that
young
age,
I
had
been
in
no
way
aware
of
the
effect
of
my
writing.
After
all,
the
reactions
to
those
early
writings
from
the
people
I
had
showed
them
to
(mostly
my
parents)
were
similarly
marred
by
a
silent
confusion,
which
always
awaited
my
gleeful
anticipation
of
a
response;
it
was
my
momOs
birthday
all
over
again,
when
I
gave
her
a
blue
otter
that
I
had
made
at
camp,
which
unfortunately
looked
like
an
unborn
fetus.
I
was
a
relentless
child
though,
my
tastes
impure
and
my
energy
unbound.
Between
Preschool
and
the
end
of
my
second
grade
year,
I
was
given
the
basic
building
blocks
of
writing.
These
early
stages
gave
me
the
tools
needed
to
sustain
my
own
personal
education
in
writing.
Though
I
would
continue
to
learn
terms
and
methods
academically,
the
wisdom
I
had
been
given
by
those
early
teachers
allowed
me
to
pursue
my
own
interests
without
being
limited
in
terms
of
how
(or
perhaps,
why)
to
express
myself.
I
feel
that
by
the
time
I
had
entered
third
grade
I
was
at
least
lucid
in
my
speech
patterns
and
could
autonomously
think
creatively,
so
the
only
really
thing
separating
me
from
being
a
writer
was
my
intent
of
writing
things
for
other
people
and
not
just
myself.
Sure,
I
wanted
to
tell
Steven
Spielberg
and
George
Lucas
(possibly
the
only
two
filmmakers
I
was
aware
of
then)
all
of
my
rambling,
energized,
though
hopefully
precocious
ideas
about
aliens,
talking
rabbits,
and
unborn
otter
fetuses,
but
even
then
I
knew
that
those
were
pipe
dreams.
It
wasnOt
until
I
was
exposed
to
cheap
and
infantile
poetry
that
I
actually
began
to
write
as
a
writer,
and,
more
annoyingly,
to
consciously
think
of
myself
as
a
writer.
My
feelings
were
that,
if
a
person
looked
serious,
and
sounded
serious,
they
would
be
serious.
My
attempts
were
sickening
to
say
the
least.
There
I
was,
writing
metaphysical
adaptations
of
Seinfeld
episodes,
finding
words
to
rhyme
with
beauty
(snooty?...
booty?),
and
even
plotting
King
Arthur-inspired
knight
poetry.
Is
it
possible,
that
I
had
become
drunk
on
writing?
In
my
own
way,
these
were
the
Tommyknockers
to
my
Stephen
King.
Except
that
instead
of
cocaine
and
Coors
light
I
had
become
drunk
on
my
own
narcissistic
seriousness.
I
mean
really,
if
I
had
continued
to
write
poetry
as
I
had
been,
I
would
be
a
very
creepy
person.
I
had
yet
again
lost
sight
of
why
accessibility
is
crucial
in
the
life
and
works
of
a
writer.
With
the
fourth
grade
brought
essays
consisting
of
more
than
4
pages,
pencils
which
were
no
longer
half
an
inch
thick,
hell
bent
teachers,
and
the
echoing
aroma
of
sweaty
prepubescent
bodies
bereft
of
deodorant
which
bound
those
teachers
further
into
their
own
inescapable
hell.
It
was
this
year
that
I
began
taking
a
dislike
to
school.
I
continued
to
write
on
my
own
free
time,
even
showing
my
teachers
(perhaps
to
make
the
appearance
that,
though
rebellious,
I
was,
in
fact,
a
respectable
and
erudite
young
man)
but
this
seemed
to
only
frustrate
them
more.
As
I
began
to
expand
my
knowledge
of
writing
by
attempting
different
styles
and
mediums,
I
subsequently
began
suffocating
my
own
academic
learning.
It
was
an
arrogant
way
of
trying
to
learn,
and
I
was
very
conscious
of
the
subversive
route
I
had
taken,
perhaps
overly
conscious
of
it.
I
likened
myself
to
a
gypsy,
circus-performing
writer.
If
I
was
Martin
Scorsese,
I
would
be
on
the
set
of
New
York,
New
York
(1978)
bagging
Liza
Manelli
in
the
trailer.
I
would
need
my
Raging
Bull
(1980)
to
return,
and
this
would
need
to
include
the
academic
expansion
of
my
literary
view.
Once
I
began
to
realize
the
importance
of
academia
in
the
acquiring
of
knowledge
(following
a
bitter
defeat
which
ended
in
me
sitting
sternly
across
the
desk
of
our
elementary
school
headmistress,
Mrs.
Grube,
with
the
words
NFuck
YouO
emblazoned
on
my
middle
fingerO)
I
began
to
fall
in
line.
This
sent
my
writing
career
into
limbo;
with
me
assuming
a
more
ideal
role
at
school
I
began
to
rebel
in
cheaper
and
more
stereotypical
ways.
After
that
abrupt
ending
to
my
youthfully
nefarious
activities,
I
wanted
an
easy
way
into
to
the
hearts
of
scholars
and
rebels
alike.
Simply
put,
I
wanted
to
be
Bob
Dylan
or
Kurt
Vonnegut.
My
tastes
had
refined
(a
bit)
but
my
understanding
of
what
it
actually
means
to
be
a
writer
was
trite
and
unknowledgeable,
to
say
the
least.
I
would
read
NDesolation
AnglesO
by
Kerouac,
as
if
I
could
understand
maybe
half,
and
pretend
to
think
about
what
I
had
assumed
was
the
meaning.
In
many
instances,
I
was
blindly
following
the
lead
of
people
that
I
had
no
real
connection
to
through
writing
or
through
life.
I
was
no
longer
thinking
of
my
writing
as
a
representation
of
me,
just
myself
as
a
representation
of
me.
I
was
that
undead
otter
baby,
and,
my
god,
would
I
have
hated
to
get
me
for
my
birthday.
This
all
coalesced
to
form
my
middle
school
experience,
or
as
I
like
to
refer
to
it
Nthe
most
awkward
years
of
my
lifeO.
Sustaining
my
nave
perception
of
literature,
writing,
and
being
literate,
I
continued
to
write
in
different
genres
and
styles
to
try
and
mimic
or,
hopefully,
play
off
of
the
different
authors
I
had
been
reading.
Personality
was
bereft
of
my
writings.
I
could
have
been
writing
tax
returns
with
the
same
amount
of
individuality
and
creativity.
This
all
changed
though
when
I
began
to
get
seriously
involved
in
music,
and
more
importantly,
songwriting.
When
I
began
writing
songs,
I
was
influenced
by
really
awful
musicN
bubble-gum
pop-punk,
or
white
boy
hip-hopNbut
nonetheless
wrote
in
different
ways.
Being
an
autodidactic
Nsongwriting
talentO
I
really
only
had
my
own
devices
of
creativity
and
composition
to
rely
on.
It
wasnOt
that
I
would
not
have
imitated
my
favorite
musical
artists
if
I
wanted
to,
I
just
couldnOt.
Surely,
every
lyric
I
committed
to
paper
was
as
trite
and
whimsical
as
my
poetry
from
years
before,
but
as
opposed
to
the
poetry,
there
was
a
great
depth
of
sincerity
that
I
had
not
written
with
before.
Perhaps
the
faade
of
a
guitar
helped
me
costume
my
own
insecurities
with
honesty,
but
it
nonetheless
gave
me
the
strength
to
simply
write
to
know
more
about
myself.
Luckily,
as
I
began
to
write
songs,
I
also
began
to
listen
to
better
music,
and
began
reading
less
for
the
sake
of
scholarly
relevance
and
more
for
the
sake
of
pure
enjoyment.
The
end
of
this
period
is
what
I
like
to
refer
to
as
the
Nliterary
floodO
in
my
life.
I
began
reading
Brett
Easton-Ellis,
Chuck
Palahniuk,
Don
Delillo,
Graham
Greene,
Nicholas
Pileggi,
the
screenplays
of
Quentin
Tarantino
and
Wes
Anderson,
listening
to
the
sounds
of
The
Beach
Boys
(seventies,
not
sixties),
Miles
Davis,
Radiohead,
My
Bloody
Valentine,
and
the
list
goes
on.
My
excitement
over
the
material
which
I
was
consuming
was
almost
insatiable,
I
was
almost
a
hermit.
Withdrawn
from
the
tumultuously
social
and
logically
retarded
confines
of
a
white
middle-American
middle
school,
I
was
free
to
pursue
whatever
I
wished,
especially
due
to
the
advent
of
the
internet.
I
began
to
amass
a
solid
collection
of
short
stories
which
I
would
publish
on
a
web
site
which
I
had
designed
and
coded
myself.
The
most
enlightening
thing
to
know
about
myself
at
the
time
was
the
fact
that
I
knew
my
works
were
all
garbage
beside
their
own
personal
value
to
me.
This
was
all
to
change
though
as
I
made
my
way
from
the
stuffy
bogs
of
middle
school
to
the
turgid
caverns
of
high
school.
There
are
so
many
preconceptions
of
high
school,
that
at
first,
I
was
consumed
by
them.
I
was
by
all
means
a
nerd
in
middle
school
(arguably
still
so
now),
but
it
was
simply
illogical
to
continue
in
the
same
ways
I
had.
After
all,
I
heard
in
interviews
and
informative
readings
that
many
of
the
people
I
had
idolized
had
gotten
their
Ngame
planO
together
in
high
school.
In
this
sense
I
felt
that
I
would
then
need
to
be
taken
seriously,
not
only
by
myself,
but
by
my
teachers
and
my
peers
as
well.
More
and
more
I
began
writing
and
practicing
music,
literature,
and
theater
with
the
ultimate
goal
of
presenting
my
work.
Of
course
I
would
continue
to
write
under
the
overwhelming
realization
that
most
of
my
work
would
go
absolutely
nowhere
and
many
people
wouldnOt
like
it,
but
my
past
nerdiness
was
still
a
crutch
to
the
presentation
of
myself
as
a
serious
creative
writer.
I
cherish
my
years
as
a
devastatingly
nerdy
geek,
or
geeky
nerd,
holed
up
in
my
room
with
a
wealthy
stash
of
comic
books,
make
your
own
fantasy
novels,
and
other
things
which
always
kept
a
playful
creativity
relevant
in
my
mind,
even
when
I
was
concerned
more
with
popularity.
By
the
time
I
had
reached
my
junior
year
of
high
school,
I
knew
that
I
would
want
to
continue
my
writing
endeavors
indefinitely.
It
was,
and
is,
the
only
thing
I
really
have
a
passion
for
doing,
and
being
the
crazy
person
that
I
am,
thought
that
this
was
a
deciding
factor
in
what
I
should
be
doing
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
It
also
helped
that
I
had
sustained
healthy
relationships
with
three
out
of
the
four
English
teachers
that
had
taught
me
in
high
school.
I
was
going
to
college
with
the
intention
of
graduating
with
a
wider
range
of
knowledge
regarding
writing
and
literature.
It
was
also
at
this
time
that
I
began
to
become
seriously
interested
in
film.
I
produced
several
shorts,
including
one
(NThe
Happy
Birthday
CowO)
which
was
submitted
for
a
scholastic
art
award
but
was
unsubmitted
after
the
art
department
reviewed
its
Ninteresting
languageO.
My
films,
which
I
not
only
wrote
and
starred
in,
but
scored,
seemed
to
be
the
amalgamation
of
my
journey
towards
finding
a
relatable
mix
of
my
own
personality
and
the
interests
of
my
intended
audience.
Filmmaking
is
now
a
supreme
and
transcendent
love
of
mine
that
I
am
actively
pursuing.
I
can
see
the
irony
in
all
of
thisNan
essay
about
my
evolution
as
a
writer
and
I
end
it
about
how
I
want
to
be
a
filmmakerNbut
the
only
truth
that
I
can
actually
rely
on,
is
that
the
principles
of
writing
which
I
have
accrued
over
the
years,
has
given
me
the
foundation
for
everything
that
I
will
ever
actively
wish
to
pursue.
The
only
hope
that
I
have
for
my
works,
is
that
their
intent
will
be
beyond
me,
but
there
effect
will
be
enthusiastically
personal.
