Wow!
What
a
request
you
have
given
me.
Trace
my
development
as
a
writer.
This
is
not
very
easy.
My
writing
history
has
gone
through
the
ringer
and
back
many,
many
times.
It
has
been
praised
and
destroyed,
reaching
some
of
the
highest
highs
to
some
of
the
lowest
of
the
Godawful
lows.
Wow,
sitting
here
thinking
of
some
of
the
things
that
came
off
my
pen
has
me
laughing
out
loud.
The
times
I
copied
the
encyclopedia
word
for
word
struggling
to
get
my
science
papers
done
in
front
of
the
television.
Those
were
always
fun.
I
never
got
caught.
Then
there
were
times
when
I
would
sit
in
front
of
my
computer
and
run
my
hands
through
my
hair
out
of
frustration.
I
would
pound
the
desk
because
the
sentences
that
I
was
forming
in
my
head
weren't
the
same
ones
that
were
coming
out
of
my
fingers.
What
the
hell!
I
would
scream
and
once
even
cried.
I've
been
through
a
lot
with
my
writing,
and
I've
received
some
pretty
interesting
marks
and
remarks.
To
understand
my
history
as
a
writer,
you
need
to
know
a
little
bit
about
me.
Hi!
My
name
is
Scheck.
I
live
in
Englewood-Cliffs
in
New
Jersey.
I
have
lived
there
all
of
my
life
with
my
parents
and
my
two
brothers.
I
am
the
middle
boy,
so
I
had
to
fight
hard
to
get
some
attention.
I
had
to
be
loud
and
outspoken,
and
I
can
write
you
another
paper
tracing
my
history
as
a
banshee.
I
watched
a
million
hours
of
television
and
had
a
million
units
of
energy,
but
not
one
ounce
of
interest
in
doing
my
homework.
I
usually
did
not
do
it,
and
when
I
did,
it
was
done
fast
and
without
care.
Television
and
sports
were
my
passion,
as
well
as
fruit
roll-ups.
I
thought
school
was
annoying
and
all
that
was
needed
was
the
going
through
of
the
motions
and
that
was
it.
The
teacher
wanted
a
paper,
I
wrote
her
a
paper.
Here
you
go
Miss,
everything
you
asked
for.
It's
the
regurgitated
information
you
wanted.
These
papers
and
essays
completely
lacked
any
passion
or
spirit.
School
didn't
matter
to
me.
Play
Ball!
Go
out!
See
some
friends!
I
had
to
always
be
around
and
ready
to
go
because
of
my
fear
of
losing
some
attention.
This
went
on
for
a
while.
In
grade
school,
I
wrote
all
different
types
of
essays.
The
ones
that
stand
out
the
most
would
have
to
be
the
book
reports.
These
were
easy.
I
would
hardly
ever
read
the
book,
but
was
able
to
gather
enough
information
from
friends
and
random
pages
I
would
turn
to.
Read
three
pages
and
write
on
them.
I
would
find
some
random
quotes
and
scribble
away
for
about
45
minutes.
That's
all.
I
usually
did
well
on
these
papers.
Hey,
who
can
argue
a
B
for
doing
nothing?
I
did
other
types
of
writing
as
well,
like
science
projects
and
history
reports.
These
were
a
day
at
the
beach
compared
to
the
book
report.
All
I
did
was
look
up
some
names
and
dates
and
copy
out
of
my
resources.
This
could
be
done
watching
cartoons
after
school
or
during
dinner.
No
need
to
even
set
aside
real
time
for
this
type
of
paper.
I
would
incorporate
it
into
my
daily
routine.
And
as
for
the
research,
one
book
was
enough.
On
my
works
sited
page,
there
were
usually
three
names
but
two
books
never
made
it
out
of
the
library.
Thoughtless
arranging
of
facts
and
ideas
are
very
easy
for
me.
I
was
born
the
son
of
a
salesman,
a
rather
successful
one.
I
acquired
the
wonderful
gift
of
gab
and
the
ability
to
let
my
audience
hear
what
they
want
to
hear.
A
couple
of
big
words
and
a
cute
little
smile
and
I
have
won
over
whomever
I
am
talking
to.
It
was
the
same
with
my
writing.
Whatever
the
teacher
wanted
to
read,
she
read
from
me.
It
worked.
I
always
got
at
least
decent
grades.
At
least
until
High
School.
The
one
thing
I
did
get
out
of
grade
school
was
my
formal
grammar
training.
This
was
where
I
learned
about
run-ons,
fragments,
and
commas.
I
did
well
with
this
learning.
I
picked
it
up
quickly
and
painlessly.
However,
was
the
only
time
that
I
was
ever
taught
this
stuff
in
school.
I
hit
a
real
bad
part
of
my
life
when
I
got
to
high
school.
There
were
some
peer-pressure
and
popularity
contests
that
took
over
my
life
and
shoved
school
out.
I
didn't
care
about
my
work.
I
was
incomplete
on
my
work
and
unprepared
for
tests.
I
didn't
care.
I
showed
up
to
class
without
books
or
a
pen
and
felt
that
I
had
more
important
places
to
be
and
more
cigarettes
to
smoke.
I
look
back
at
me
then
and
get
embarrassed.
I
remember
watching
VH-1
on
Rock
and
Roll
in
the
80's.
Band
members
laughing
and
telling
the
camera
that
they
are
ashamed
of
their
hair-sprayed
hair
and
ripped
jeans.
They
reminisce
and
blush
just
like
I
do
when
I
think
of
how
naive
I
was
at
this
time.
This
all
came
to
a
screeching
halt
when
I
was
asked
to
write
a
three
to
five
page
short
story
about
anything
we
wanted.
Well,
that
meant
two
full
pages
and
one
half
of
another
(hey,
she
got
three
pages)
.
The
assignment
was
due
in
two
weeks.
One
week
and
six
days
went
by,
and
it
was
time
to
write
my
masterpiece.
I
HAND
WROTE
a
three
page
paper
in
25
minutes.
There
were
no
paragraphs
and
run-on
sentences
everywhere.
It
was
a
piece
of
garbage.
What
junk!
Worst
of
all,
the
paper
wasn't
even
college
ruled.
I
had
the
nerve
to
turn
this
in.
I
actually
placed
this
on
the
pile
of
others
that
were
typed
and
thought
out.
When
I
got
mine
back,
I
got
an
F.
I
was
embarrassed
in
front
of
the
whole
class
by
the
teacher.
I
could
feel
the
eyeballs
from
all
around
the
room
burn
into
me
with
their
viscous
stares.
I
broke
out
into
a
sweat
and
felt
miserable
for
three
weeks
after.
I
really
wanted
to
improve
myself.
I
had
the
chance
that
same
semester
when
my
biology
class
was
given
the
egg
project.
This
was
cute.
I
got
married
and
had
an
egg
baby
with
a
friend
and
was
in
charge
of
taking
care
of
an
egg
for
two
weeks.
All
the
babies
were
given
a
disease
and
we
all
had
to
research
and
explain
the
illness
in
five
to
seven
pages
typed.
This
was
the
first
time
that
I
ever
actually
worked
on
my
work.
I
read
books
and
took
notes.
I
actually
enjoyed
this
paper
and
learned
a
lot.
I
sprawled
out
on
the
floor
in
my
brother's
room
and
didn't
leave
until
I
was
done.
I
could
feel
my
English
teacher
kicking
me
in
the
ass
as
I
burned
through
Thalassemia
A,
an
anemic
disorder.
I
did
well
that
day
and
I
could
feel
the
warmth
coming
back
into
my
chest.
It
felt
damn
good
to
look
at
and
reread
my
work.
I
was
so
proud
of
myself
because
when
I
got
it
back,
I
got
an
A-.
I
have
never
kept
a
journal.
To
me,
a
keeping
a
journal
is
like
going
to
the
gym.
I
get
all
pumped
up
to
start
one
and
then
after
two
or
three
entries,
I
lose
my
focus.
It's
too
bad.
I
have
had
some
twisted
times
that
I
would
love
to
have
recorded
in
high
school.
I
felt
that
I
could
always
remember
what
had
happened
but
now
high
school
is
a
blur.
I
write
sometimes,
but
not
as
much
as
I
would
like
to.
When
I
got
to
Lafayette,
I
went
back
to
my
old
tricks.
I
hated
my
FYS
and
FYW
classes.
I
went
through
the
motions
again.
As
I
think
about
it,
it
was
the
authority
that
bothered
me.
I
did
not
like
being
told
that
I
had
to
take
these
classes.
I
wasn't
interested
in
the
material.
I
didn't
like
the
professors
or
the
books
we
read.
So
I
did
it
again,
I
gave
the
teacher
what
he
asked
for.
I
discovered
that
I
could
write
when
I
took
Literary
Questions.
I
took
it
because
I
wanted
to
take
it.
I
was
interested
in
what
the
professor
said
and
the
different
angles
we
approached
everything.
What
a
brilliant
man
my
professor
was.
I
challenged
myself
to
impress
him
and
myself.
I
would
sit
in
front
of
the
computer
and
explode!
It
was
the
first
time
I
had
a
problem
expressing
myself.
My
thoughts
would
go
100
miles
per
hour
while
my
fingers
went
two.
I
would
bang
on
the
desk
and
use
hand
motions
to
write.
If
anyone
had
seen
me,
they
would
think
I
was
crazy.
(I
still
dtne
them
now)
These
papers
were
thought
papers.
I
appreciated
them
as
they
challenged
me
and
kicked
my
ass.
They
really
did.
I
welcomed
it
and
I
would
struggle
to
win
because
I
wanted
to.
I
wanted
to
show
myself
that
I
could
conquer
these
books
and
essays.
I
feel
that
a
paper
topic
is
a
dare
from
a
professor
and
I
have
to
shove
my
essay
in
his
face
and
say,
I
beat
the
shit
out
of
your
feeble
attempt
to
stump
me.
Notice
the
passion
here.
This
is
how
my
writing
has
become;
it
is
very
explosive
and
full
of
rage.
I
learned
to
write
on
the
computer
by
myself.
When
I
was
little,
I
hand-wrote
everything.
That
was
normal.
I
would
go
from
start
to
finish
in
that
order.
There
was
no
cutting
and
pasting
when
I
was
growing
up.
My
spelling
check
was
my
mother.
In
college,
I
had
to
write
a
museum
paper
for
one
of
my
art-history
classes.
It
was
no
research
and
all
thought.
It
was
very
interesting
how
I
attacked
and
tackled
this
problem.
For
the
first
time,
I
poured
out
everything
on
the
computer
and
sorted
it
out
from
there.
I
deleted,
cut,
and
pasted
together
my
finest
work
I
have
ever
done.
I
picked
apart
at
it
piece
by
piece
in
no
particular
order.
This
is
how
I
write
today,
and
I
find
it
much
better
than
starting
from
top
to
bottom.
That
is
basically
it.
It
took
me
a
while
to
develop
my
writing,
but
now
I
am
very
pleased
with
it.
I
have
accepted
the
fact
that
I
am
not
a
factual
guy.
I
don't
like
to
regurgitate
facts
and
data
onto
a
sheet
of
paper.
I
hate
the
boundaries
and
restrictions.
I
am
a
firecracker
of
a
writer.
I'm
passionate
and
volatile
when
I
write.
I
guess
the
best
way
to
describe
my
skills
is
to
use
a
baseball
analogy.
I'm
not
the
starting
pitcher
who
works
eight
innings
picking
apart
every
batter
I
face.
I
don't
think
and
strategize
my
pitches.
I'm
the
closer,
the
guy
who
throws
100
miles
per
hour
for
one
inning.
Just
give
me
the
ball
and
I'll
burn
em
in
there.
I
don't
worry
about
anything
when
I'm
writing,
I
just
throw
fastballs.
I
am
definitely
weird
like
that.
