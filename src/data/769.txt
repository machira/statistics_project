The
Multiple
Personalities
of
a
Writing
Associate
My
time
as
a
Writing
Associate,
though
short
so
far,
has
been
one
of
the
most
rewarding
and
education
experiences
I
have
had
at
Lafayette.
The
chance
to
work
with
my
peers
on
writing
techniques
is
a
dream
on
true.
As
a
WA,
one
of
the
most
important
things
I
learned
is
to
look
at
a
paper
from
multiple
perspectives:
the
writerOs,
the
audience,
usually
the
professorOs,
and
an
unbiased
third
party.
By
using
these
two
perspectives,
one
can
gain
much
more
from
a
paper
than
simply
reading
it
as
the
writer.
This
dual
perspective
take
on
papers
has
helped
me
with
othersO
writing
as
well
as
in
my
own.
The
facilitative
approach
has
been
extremely
successful
for
me
as
both
a
Writing
Associate
and
as
a
writer.
It
has
changed
the
way
I
view
writing,
both
others
and
my
own,
entirely.
The
facilitative
approach
focuses
on
forcing
the
writer
to
think
about
their
own
work
through
the
use
of
leading
questions
and
a
variety
of
suggestions.
This
allows
the
writer
to
discover
her
writing
on
her
own,
rather
than
have
the
answers
simply
handed
to
her.
Ultimately,
this
leads
to
a
change
in
writing
approach
for
the
future,
not
for
one
paper.
This
means
future,
long-term
success
as
a
writer
and
as
a
thinker.
I
have
used
the
facilitative
response
every
time
I
have
approached
a
piece
of
writing
since
first
learning
about
it
last
fall.
In
conferences,
I
make
sure
to
ask
the
student
writer
leading
questions,
as
suggested
in
Karen
GocsikOs
essay,
NResponding
to
Problems:
A
Facilitative
Approach.O
Gocsik
suggests
asking
such
questions
as,
NWhere
is
your
thesis
sentence?,O
NHow
do
you
plan
on
supporting
your
thesis?,O
and
NCan
you
explain
this
paragraph
to
me?O
These
questions
force
the
writer
to
talk
about
her
writing
and
view
it
from
a
different
perspective
than
her
own,
allowing
her
to
see
where
she
may
need
to
explain
further
or
edit
out
parts
of
the
paper.
I
have
also
used
the
facilitative
approach
while
helping
friends
out
with
papers
in
much
the
same
way
I
have
helped
peer
student
writers
in
WA
conferences.
There
is
nothing
more
gratifying
for
both
Writing
Associates
and
students
as
a
successful
conference,
wherein
the
student
discovers
how
to
improve
their
writing
in
a
specific
paper
that
can
positively
affect
the
way
the
approach
future
papers.
The
reason
this
is
so
gratifying
is
because,
more
often
than
not,
WA
conferences
have
the
tendency
to
be
awkward
because
either
the
student
or
the
WA
feels
uncomfortable,
anxious,
or
frightened.
I
have
found
that
this
is
usually
a
result
of
the
double
perspective:
students
are
not
as
eager
to
share
their
works
with
their
peers,
often
preferring
their
professors.
Students
attending
WA
conferences
fear
being
judged
by
their
peers
as
a
peer
rather
than
as
an
aid,
either
because
they
are
unsatisfied
with
their
work
or
they
are
simply
uncomfortable
sharing
it
with
others
who
are
not
their
professor.
WAs
simply
feel
uncomfortable
when
their
peers
are
uncomfortable.
It
is
a
vicious
cycle
that
can
be
solved
by
reminding
yourself
and
your
peer
students
that
you
are
editing
their
paper
as
an
unbiased
third
party
from
the
perspective
of
a
fellow
student
as
well
as
their
professor,
who
will
ultimately
read
the
finished
work,
and
that
you
are
there
not
to
judge
but
to
help.
WAs
have
the
advantage
of
reading
a
paper
from
these
perspectives
that
others
do
not.
This
makes
students
feel
more
comfortable
knowing
that
their
peers
are
not
judging
them,
but
helping
them,
as
they
can
see
both
sides
of
the
paper.
If
students
see
WAs
only
as
a
peer
rather
than
as
a
peer
mentor,
conferences
were
often
difficult.
My
most
uncomfortable
conferences
were
those
where
the
student
came
to
the
conference
unprepared,
with
a
paper
unfinished,
barely
written,
or
barely
researched,
because
they
assumed
that,
as
a
fellow
student,
I
would
understand
and
be
able
work
with
them
regardless.
These
students
did
not
realize
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
confer
about
a
paper
that
did
not
exist.
In
WA
weekly
meetings,
fellow
WAs
suggested
that,
in
these
situations,
it
is
best
to
try
to
have
the
student
in
the
conference
write
something,
be
it
an
outline,
an
opening
paragraph,
or
a
plan
of
attack.
Those
students
who
came
to
my
conferences
without
a
paper
ready
had
little
desire
to
do
work.
When
I
would
ask
them
if
they
wanted
to
create
an
outline,
they
would
simply
shrug
and
say
they
Njust
needed
to
start
itO
and
they
would
be
fine.
I
found
it
difficult
to
tell
these
students,
most
of
whom
were
seniors
while
I
was
still
a
sophomore,
to
try
to
do
work
in
my
presence.
Unfortunately,
seniority
controlled
these
conferences
and
the
students
who
were
older
than
me
saw
me
merely
as
a
peer
rather
than
a
peer
mentor,
not
taking
my
presence
or
advise
seriously.
In
doing
so,
they
missed
out
on
an
opportunity
to
have
a
second
opinion
on
their
work,
a
chance
even
the
most
experienced
writers
will
never
skip
out
on.
My
best
experience
as
a
WA
occurred
during
one
night
of
drop-in.
It
was
a
slow
night,
as
most
drop-in
nights
are,
until
close
to
the
end
of
my
shift.
A
freshman
I
knew
from
class
came
in
and
asked
for
help
with
one
of
her
papers.
She
was
clearly
stressed
by
the
paper
and
claimed
that
the
entire
paper
would
have
to
be
re-done.
Before
I
read
the
paper,
I
asked
her
what
the
assignment
was
and
how
she
planned
to
approach
it,
then
had
her
write
down
her
own
plans.
I
then
read
the
paper
and
asked
how
each
paragraph
fit
into
the
plan
she
had
previously
made
with
me.
I
felt
I
was
more
of
a
guide
than
an
editor,
allowing
the
student
to
make
her
own
changes
according
to
her
own
plan.
It
turned
out
much
of
the
paper
was
worth
keeping,
and
although
the
student
did
not
finish
the
entire
paper
during
our
conference,
she
did
create
a
solid
outline
to
finish
it
later
that
night.
The
most
rewarding
part
of
the
conference
was
when
the
light
bulb
clearly
lit
up
in
the
studentOs
mind
as
we
started
making
the
outline
and
she
said,
NThatOs
what
I
needed
this
whole
time!
IOm
going
to
do
this
for
all
of
my
papers
from
now
on.
This
is
perfect.O
Hearing
the
student
make
a
decision
about
not
only
the
work
at
hand
but
future
works,
without
my
saying
so,
was
extremely
rewarding.
Not
that
getting
the
student
a
high
mark
on
any
specific
paper
is
the
goal
of
a
WA
conference,
but
it
also
made
me
smile
when
the
student
came
up
to
me
a
few
weeks
later
and
told
me
that
she
not
only
received
an
A
on
the
paper
we
worked
on,
but
on
a
second
paper
she
wrote
after,
on
her
own.
My
introduction
to
the
facilitative
method,
my
experiences
in
conferences,
and
the
knowledge
I
gained
from
my
fellow
Writing
Associates
in
weekly
meetings
greatly
changed
the
way
I
had
thought
about
writing.
Before
joining
the
College
Writing
Program,
I
never
thought
to
take
the
steps
that
I
now
do
before
handing
in
a
paper.
The
extra
work
is
really
not
work
at
all
-
it
is
part
of
a
necessary
process
that
ensures
good
writing
habits
forever,
not
for
one
paper.
When
I
began
my
career
at
Lafayette,
my
main
concern
when
writing
papers
was
receiving
an
A.
Every
time.
This,
to
me,
was
the
best
measure
of
my
success,
proving
that
my
writing
was
satisfactory
and
deserving
of
the
highest
grade
possible.
My
first
semester
English
class
changed
that
thinking
for
me
very
quickly.
I
received
Bs
on
the
first
four
of
ten
short
papers
for
the
semester,
as
well
as
on
the
first
five-page
paper.
Though
I
was
initially
very
upset,
I
came
to
understand
that
a
B
is
a
gift
-
it
allows
for
room
to
grow.
This
mind-set
was
furthered
during
my
time
as
a
Writing
Associate.
During
weekly
meetings,
Professor
Tatu
emphasized
that
the
goal
of
any
conference
was
not
to
help
the
student
receive
an
A
on
one
paper,
but
to
improve
their
writing
as
a
whole
by
introducing
ways
to
improve
their
writing
on
one
particular
paper
in
the
hopes
that
the
student
would
apply
those
approaches
to
all
future
papers.
As
a
group,
my
Writing
Associate
peers,
Professor
Tatu,
and
I
analyzed
several
works
written
by
actual
students
and
discussed
how
we
would
go
about
discussing
those
papers
with
students
in
a
WA
conferences.
We
read
the
paper
as
if
we
were
the
student
writer,
the
professor,
and
as
ourselves,
the
WA
and
then
discussed
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
paper
and
of
various
potential
approaches
we
would
use
in
a
conference
to
discuss
and
work
on
the
paper
with
its
student
writer.
These
exercises
helped
develop
the
dual
personality
one
must
have
in
order
to
be
a
Writing
Associate.
I
took
the
approaches
that
I
learned
to
apply
to
WA
conferences
and
learned
to
apply
them
to
my
own
writing.
Through
all
of
these
experiences,
my
writing
own
approach
to
writing
has
been
changed.
Now,
before
I
even
begin
a
paper,
I
am
sure
to
plan
ahead
by
noting
the
overlying
themes
of
the
paper
and
making
sure
that
everything
in
the
paper
can
be
easily
traced
back
to
those
themes.
While
re-reading
my
paper,
I
make
sure
to
read
it
from
my
own
perspective,
from
how
I
think
my
professor
will
read
it,
and
from
a
third
partyOs.
I
also
NWAO
myself
with
the
facilitative
approach
by
using
these
different
perspectives
to
make
sure
that
my
arguments
are
clear
and
fit
the
theme
of
the
paper.
Although
it
sounds
silly,
I
ask
myself
the
same
questions
I
would
ask
any
peer
student
writer
attending
one
of
my
WA
conferences.
I
often
ask
my
roommates,
classmates,
or
a
fellow
WA
to
read
over
my
papers
as
well.
I
ask
them
to
note
if
anything
in
the
paper
seems
out
of
place,
either
because
it
lacks
a
clear
explanation
that
would
tie
it
to
the
overall
theme
or
because
it
is
extraneous
information
that
simply
does
not
belong
in
the
paper.
This
helps
me
gain
yet
another
perspective
on
my
paper
to
ensure
its
clarity
and
presentation
before
ultimately
handing
it
in
to
a
professor.
I
am
looking
forward
to
rejoining
the
College
Writing
Program
this
year
as
a
Writing
Associate.
I
hope
that,
as
a
junior,
seniority
issues
like
the
one
I
describes
above,
will
be
less
of
a
problem
for
me
and,
if
they
are,
I
find
a
way
to
work
around
them.
I
also
hope
that
I
can
continue
to
have
successful
conferences,
such
as
the
one
I
described
earlier.
