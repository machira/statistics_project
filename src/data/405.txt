Project
for
Workshop
Writing
As
a
WA
Fall
2003
Returning
Writing
Associates
Almost
exactly
a
year
ago
I
sat
down
at
my
laptop
to
do
what
I
am
doing
now
and
pondered
my
history
as
a
writer.
I
was
anxious,
as
it
was
my
first
assignment
as
a
new
WA
and
because
I
wanted
to
impress
the
group
of
talented
writers
who
would
be
reading
my
paper.
I
was
insecure
about
my
ability
to
write
and
I
was
always
at
a
loss
for
words
when
I
would
attempt
to
begin
a
paper.
I
had
never
paid
much
attention
to
the
stages
of
writing
and
their
significance.
After
a
year,
different
experiences
and
much
learning,
I
now
take
even
more
time
to
find
the
words
to
begin
a
paper,
but
I
know
that
doing
so
is
okay.
I
have
come
to
realize
that
a
paper
is
not
simply
a
finished
product,
but
the
reflection
of
an
experience
that
must
be
guided
by
an
open
mind.
I
am
a
different
writer
now
because
of
my
experience
as
a
WA.
As
I
learned
to
listen
more
to
students
and
professors
alike,
I
began
to
see
improvements
in
my
ability
both
as
a
WA
and
a
writer.
Listening
is
an
important
communication
skill,
and
communication
is
integral
to
the
writing
process.
One
of
the
most
beneficial
aspects
of
the
WA
program
for
WAs
themselves
is
learning
how
to
communicate
and
work
with
others.
Through
encounters
with
other
WAs,
the
students
who
came
to
me
for
help,
as
well
as
the
professor
who
I
worked
with
in
the
WA
program,
I
discovered
how
much
I
learned
by
listening
to
them
talk.
One
of
the
main
duties
of
a
WA
is
to
be
an
informed
reader.
I
had
been
assigned
to
a
First
Year
Seminar
on
gothic
literature,
but
I
had
no
experience
with
dark,
scary
writing.
I
knew
I
had
a
lot
to
learn
in
the
first
meeting
I
had
with
the
professor
of
the
class
before
I
met
with
the
students.
That
first
meeting
was
one
of
the
most
important
learning
experiences
in
my
history
as
a
writer
because
I
listened
more
intently
than
I
could
recall
having
ever
done
before.
I
took
more
notes
than
I
had
ever
taken
in
any
other
meeting
with
a
professor.
I
knew
I
would
not
be
able
to
recall
the
borage
of
new
information
that
was
flying
at
me,
so
I
recorded
it,
and
doing
so
helped
me
to
listen
even
more
carefully.
This
became
a
practice
that
I
used
regularly
that
school
year.
My
first
round
of
WA
conferences
was
an
intimidating
experience
for
me.
Over
the
course
of
several
days,
about
fifteen
pairs
of
eager
young
eyes
looked
to
me
for
assistance.
They
had
more
confidence
in
me
than
I
had
in
myself.
They
turned
to
me
with
a
seemingly
unwavering
belief
that
I
was
an
informed
reader
who
could
help
them.
They
were
anxious
to
impress
their
professor
with
the
first
paper
of
their
college
career,
and
they
turned
to
me
for
the
key
to
collegiate
academic
enlightenment.
Little
did
they
know
that
I
was
a
beginner
at
the
job
with
no
more
than
a
year
of
additional
writing
experience
than
they
had
(I
was
only
nineteen
and
most
of
them
were
just
a
year
younger).
We
were
peers
who
would
be
learning
about
writing
together.
When
the
first
students
that
I
would
be
working
with
timidly
entered
Pardee
319,
I
smiled
and
told
them
to
have
a
seat.
I
hoped
more
than
anything
that
they
would
find
me
to
be
helpful.
I
tried
to
think
about
what
my
WA
had
done
that
had
worked
for
me
a
year
earlier
when
I
was
in
the
same
situation
as
these
students
were
in
now.
My
WA
had
been
friendly
and
genuinely
seemed
interested
in
what
I
had
to
say.
He
always
praised
the
aspects
of
my
writing
that
were
strong,
which
served
as
the
encouragement
that
I
had
needed
to
help
me
to
improve
more.
I
attempted
to
do
the
same
as
my
WA
had
done
for
me.
Even
in
my
first
meetings,
I
felt
confident
that
commencing
the
meeting
with
questions
was
the
right
thing
to
do,
and
I
tried
to
never
forget
to
comment
on
each
writerOs
strengths.
In
the
first
meetings,
I
found
myself
talking
a
little
too
much.
I
asked
questions
and
they
were
answered,
but
I
was
too
quick
to
express
myself
in
return.
I
found
the
consequence
of
this
was
that
the
meetings
would
come
to
a
standstill.
I
was
not
sure
at
first
what
I
had
done
wrong.
I
realized
within
the
first
couple
of
days
of
my
first
round
of
conferences
that
people
write
from
different
views.
I
read
a
lot
of
papers
that
varied
from
one
another,
even
though
they
were
all
on
the
same
topic.
I
realized
that
there
is
a
fine
line
between
being
helping
as
an
informed
reader
who
listens
patiently
and
taking
the
liberty
to
explain
the
knowledge
that
I
have
with
a
person
who
is
there
to
learn
from
me.
I
discovered
that
a
meeting
would
best
progress
when
I
accepted
a
differing
perspective
and
then
allowed
the
other
student
to
do
the
majority
of
the
talking.
The
more
the
other
student
talked,
the
more
relaxed
facial
expressions
and
relief
would
reward
me.
I
was
not
there
to
lecture;
I
was
there
to
listen.
As
soon
as
I
sensed
that
my
peer
had
calmed,
I
did
as
well.
When
a
comfortable
conversation
about
the
topic
at
hand
began,
I
felt
rewarded
by
the
progress
that
was
taking
place.
My
insecurity
was
slowly
being
replaced
by
confidence.
This
is
working,
I
thought
to
myself.
I
can
do
this
and
I
will
learn
to
become
better
at
it.
To
become
better
at
anything,
one
needs
experience.
Being
a
WA
helped
to
improve
my
writing
because
it
provided
me
with
the
opportunity
to
gain
experience
from
a
whole
new
and
different
angle.
I
discovered
that
there
was
much
I
could
learn
from
my
peers.
There
were
peers
who
were
more
experienced
than
I
was
at
being
a
WA
who
I
turned
to
for
advice,
and
there
were
peers
who
had
no
experience
with
college
writing
and
turned
to
me
for
advice.
The
exposure
that
I
had
to
writing
through
discussing
it
with
different
people
was
unparalleled
by
any
other
writing-related
experience
that
I
had
ever
had
before.
I
found
that
by
communicating
with
other
writers
and
keeping
an
open
mind
to
what
others
had
to
say
would
help
me
to
learn
from
ideas
that
I
may
never
have
had
myself.
The
most
complicated
issue
I
encountered
as
a
WA
was
dealing
with
a
student
who
had
severe
problems
with
communication.
He
is
the
most
insecure
person
I
have
ever
met
and
he
would
dart
his
eyes
nervously
about
the
room
to
anything
other
than
my
face,
making
it
impossible
to
meet
my
gaze.
I
met
with
him
for
the
first
time
in
the
middle
of
my
initial
round
of
conferences,
and
I
began
the
conference
with
some
general
questions
as
I
had
in
my
previous
meetings
with
the
other
students
in
his
class.
Not
only
did
this
student
write
the
most
confusing
paper
of
all,
but
he
also
could
not
explain
himself,
and
I
mean
that
literally.
Through
a
severe
stutter
and
constantly
averted
eyes,
he
attempted
to
explain
his
ideas
before
he
would
stop
short
mid
sentence
to
mop
non-existent
sweat
from
his
dry
brow.
He
looked
as
though
he
would
pass
out
from
the
pressure
of
the
simplest
questions.
The
most
progress
I
managed
made
in
that
first
meeting
was
understanding
enough
of
his
words
to
realize
that
he
was
baffled
by
what
his
professor
and
I
had
to
say
about
writing
a
paper.
He
was
thoroughly
confused,
and
in
turn
I
was
left
feeling
more
puzzled
than
I
had
at
the
beginning
of
the
meeting.
I
contacted
the
professor
about
this
student
and
the
professor
was
well
aware
of
the
difficulties
the
student
had
with
communication
and
understanding
how
to
write.
It
was
a
relief
to
have
someone
to
vent
to
about
such
a
trying
encounter.
Such
an
insecure
student
needed
praise,
so
in
the
next
meeting
a
few
weeks
later
I
immediately
pointed
to
the
aspects
of
his
paper
that
were
strong.
When
I
managed
to
grasp
what
he
was
saying
after
a
lengthy
question-answer
session,
I
realized
he
had
a
better
understanding
of
complicated
aspects
of
the
novel
than
many
of
his
classmates.
He
clearly
was
an
intelligent
young
man
who
was
far
too
bashful
to
express
himself
aloud
or
in
writing.
His
response
to
my
praise
was
remarkable.
He
ceased
wiping
the
non-existent
sweat
from
his
brow
and
instead
he
continued
talking
with
the
less
prodding.
Later
in
the
day
of
our
second
meeting,
I
received
and
e-mail
from
him
requesting
an
additional
conference
to
review
the
changes
that
he
had
made
to
the
draft
that
I
had
worked
on
with
him
earlier.
I
felt
a
wave
of
pride.
He
had
confidence
in
my
ability
as
a
writer
and
I
did
too,
as
I
was
rewarded
with
signs
of
improvement.
I
learned
from
this
experience
how
important
confidence
and
communication
is
to
becoming
a
better
writer.
Conveying
ideas
is
not
always
easy,
especially
if
one
truly
does
not
consider
his
ideas
to
be
valid.
I
became
a
better
WA
when
I
started
to
believe
that
I
was
equipped
to
do
my
job
well.
This
summer
I
had
an
experience
that
reflected
much
of
what
I
learned
as
a
WA.
I
was
a
counselor
at
a
sleep
away
camp
where
I
had
spent
most
of
my
childhood
summers.
I
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
have
the
opportunity
to
meet
new
people
and
work
outdoors
with
kids.
My
expectations
were
far
surpassed.
It
was
not
only
fun,
but
it
was
also
one
of
the
most
valuable
experiences
I
have
ever
had.
I
was
shocked
at
first
to
find
how
much
my
role
as
a
counselor
resembled
my
role
as
a
WA.
From
the
first
week
of
orientation,
I
learned
skills
that
would
help
me
to
communicate
with
children
who
would
be
dependent
on
my
support.
My
campers
would
need
to
feel
confident
and
comfortable
that
I
would
be
there
at
any
time
they
needed
me
to
help
with
anything.
I
was
entrusted
with
the
tremendous
but
rewarding
task
of
being
an
informed,
knowledgeable
person
who
was
to
execute
these
duties
in
a
professional
manner,
just
as
I
do
as
a
WA.
The
aspect
of
the
counselor
orientation
that
I
went
through
in
June
that
was
stressed
most
of
all
was
listening.
Keeping
an
open
ear
would
allow
me
to
be
aware
of
problems
that
could
be
escalating
among
campers
in
my
cabin.
Paying
attention
to
higher
authority
would
help
guide
me
through
situations
that
I
knew
little
about.
The
same
proves
itself
when
I
apply
such
skills
to
my
role
as
a
WA.
.
Even
though
I
went
through
a
training
process
for
becoming
a
WA
and
for
becoming
a
counselor,
I
learned
the
most
from
the
individuals
who
I
encountered
along
the
way.
Through
each
person
who
I
dealt
with
this
summer,
I
learned
something
new.
As
my
knowledge
accumulated,
I
realized
that
learning
is
a
process
of
constant
continuation.
Similarly,
as
a
WA
I
learned
the
most
from
all
of
the
different
people
who
I
worked
with.
What
I
learned
this
summer
reinforced
what
I
had
learned
in
the
initial
meeting
that
I
had
with
the
professor
of
the
class
that
I
was
assigned
to.
Listening
intently
to
my
campers
express
themselves
in
a
bunk
meeting
was
the
best
way
for
me
to
understand
situations.
Hearing
each
opinion
was
important
to
pain
a
full
picture.
This
fact
reminded
me
that
one
of
the
most
important
research
methodologies
that
I
could
ever
use
as
a
writer
is
preliminary
listening.
When
one
of
my
professors
would
hand
out
a
new
paper
assignment,
I
would
not
settle
for
the
instructions
that
the
professor
had
typed
on
the
page.
I
would
ask
questions
about
the
assignment,
pay
attention
to
the
response,
then
immediately
write
down
what
I
had
heard
as
accurately
as
possible.
I
would
remain
attentive
to
the
questions
and
responses
of
other
students
in
my
classes.
I
found
that
listening
to
the
paper
topic
discussed
from
the
perspective
of
other
writers
opened
doors
to
ideas
that
otherwise
would
never
have
occurred
to
me.
Spending
such
an
extensive
amount
of
time
and
energy
focusing
on
the
topic
as
a
preliminary
stage
of
the
writing
process
helped
me
to
meet
the
expectations
of
the
professor.
By
setting
a
higher
goal
of
meeting
certain
expectations,
I
forced
myself
to
address
angles
of
the
paper
that
were
outside
of
my
comfort
zone.
I
would
first
write
about
aspects
of
the
topic
that
I
felt
comfortable
discussing,
then
I
would
refer
back
to
the
notes
that
I
had
taken
about
the
paper
in
class
to
see
what
else,
even
if
I
was
unfamiliar
with
such
angles,
the
professor
expected
from
an
OAO
paper.
This
helped
me
to
break
away
from
the
frame
of
mind
that
I
had
developed
in
high
school
to
strive
for
an
A.
Last
year,
I
learned
instead
that
by
striving
to
meet
expectations,
I
in
turn
would
have
to
maintain
an
open
mind
to
learning
about
and
then
writing
about
ideas
that
had
previously
been
unfamiliar
to
me;
the
grade
would
come
only
as
an
afterthought
rather
than
as
an
initial
driving
force.
My
papers
were
no
longer
products
that
reflected
my
motivation
to
succeed;
instead
they
became
the
finale
of
a
significant
and
carefully
mapped
experience.
Such
a
tangible
reflection
of
careful
thought
and
methodical
consideration
could
only
have
followed
listening
room
an
open
mind.
