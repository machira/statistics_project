Prof.

My
experience
as
a
writing
associate
(WA)
has
helped
me
develop
not
only
as
a
writer
but
also
as
a
person.
I
have
learned
valuable
skills
to
work
with
other
students
and
help
them
develop
their
critical
thinking.
Not
only
did
I
learn
how
to
be
patient
with
students,
the
impotance
of
setting
expectations
before
a
conference
begins
and
how
to
approach
every
individual
in
order
to
have
a
successful
and
rewarding
conference,
but
also
my
writing
process
has
improved
immensely
as
I
have
read
so
many
other
papers
and
have
learned
from
the
mistakes
my
peers
make.
I
am
now
putting
much
more
thought
in
the
process
of
organizing
my
paper
and
I
have
been
trying
harder
to
address
my
audience
and
the
writing
assignment.
Before
joining
the
writing
program,
I
used
to
neglect
the
editing
process
of
the
paper,
but
ever
since
I
became
a
WA
I
realized
that
in
fact
it
is
the
most
important
thing
to
do
when
writing
a
paper.
Although
learning
to
be
patient,
to
revise
and
to
spot
mistakes
and
vague
points
that
might
not
necessarily
be
visible
at
first
sight
is
a
difficult
process,
it
is
a
very
rewarding
one.
I
learned
the
importance
of
editing
and
reflecting
upon
your
paper,
of
focusing
on
the
reader,
and
of
making
sure
your
message
is
conveyed
successfully.
By
talking
to
students
and
discussing
their
papers
I
saw
different
approaches
and
writing
styles.
Working
on
the
paper
through
an
open
conversation
about
its
organization
and
ideas
is
one
of
the
keys
to
a
successful
WA
conference.
A
successful
WA
conference
requires
the
WA
to
be
more
of
a
listener
and
NnavigatorO
of
the
thought
process
of
the
writer
rather
than
instructing
the
student
and
correcting
his/her
mistakes.
This
is
important
as
the
student
would
learn
more
and
evolve
more
as
a
writer
if
he/she
comes
up
with
suggestions
on
how
to
improve
the
paper.
Working
with
other
students
and
helping
them
improve
their
papers,
I
have
indeed
found
it
difficult
at
first
to
stop
my
initial
reaction
of
correcting
all
the
mistakes
and
clarifying
all
the
points
that
appeared
vague
on
the
paper.
That
was
especially
difficult
in
the
beginning
of
my
WA
experience
when
I
would
not
have
a
specific
approach
established
and
would
jump
into
correcting
the
studentsO
papers
for
the
moment
I
would
feel
that
the
student
is
reluctant
to
reflect
on
his/her
piece.
In
fact,
one
of
the
greatest
challenges
I
have
been
facing
as
a
WA
is
when
the
student
has
been
reluctant
to
participate
in
the
conference,
and
has
not
been
responsive
to
the
questions
I
asked
to
help
them
realize
the
weaknesses
of
the
paper.
I
tried
all
sorts
of
approaches
such
as
having
a
brief
small
talk
in
the
beginning
to
make
the
student
feel
comfortable,
or
explaining
to
them
the
importance
of
their
participation
in
the
conference.
However,
I
was
finding
it
difficult
sometimes
to
engage
the
writer
in
such
a
conversation
and
was
getting
discouraged
that
I
can
be
successful
as
a
WA
until
I
had
a
very
successful
conference
during
my
second
round
of
conferences.
I
set
the
expectations
of
the
conference
in
the
very
beginning
firmly
stating
what
the
purpose
of
a
WA
is
in
the
writing
process
and
what
the
student
needs
to
do
in
order
to
get
the
most
out
of
the
experience.
This
approach
managed
to
make
the
student
I
was
working
with
feel
comfortable
to
answer
my
questions,
open
up
and
think
about
his
paper
aloud.
Once
the
student
realized
that
my
role
as
a
WA
was
not
to
sit
down
and
simply
correct
his
paper
but
rather
to
help
him
clear
his
ideas
and
organization
by
talking
about
the
subject
and
answering
specific
questions,
he
was
much
more
responsive.
The
result
was
an
hour-long
conversation
about
the
topic
and
the
ideas
he
wanted
to
convey
to
the
reader.
In
the
end
of
the
conference,
the
student
shared
with
me
that
he
found
it
very
useful
and
two
weeks
later,
he
sent
me
an
e-mail
to
tell
me
he
received
an
A+
on
the
paper.
This
reassured
me
and
gave
me
the
necessary
confidence
to
believe
that
I
can
indeed
lead
such
a
conference.
In
my
following
conferences,
I
would
always
set
up
expectations
upfront
and
not
give
in
to
the
frustration
of
the
students
who
most
often
expect
to
have
questions
answered
instead
of
to
answer
questions.
Setting
expectations
is
only
one
of
the
several
approaches
that
we
have
discussed
during
our
staff
meetings.
The
two
approaches
that
I
have
used
the
most
throughout
my
WA
experience
are
the
facilitative
and
the
instructive
approach.
I
have
been
doing
my
best
to
use
the
facilitative
approach
that
we
have
been
discussing
at
staff
meetings,
but
that
is
very
challenging
at
times
as
mentioned
before
because
some
students
are
reluctant
to
participate.
The
predisposdisition
of
the
student
and
his/her
willingness
to
get
engaged
in
the
conference
are
some
of
the
greatest
limitations
and
obstacles
to
the
facilitative
approach.
That
is
why
before
the
conference
I
always
put
the
paper
away
and
spend
the
first
5
to
10min
talking
the
student
about
the
assignment,
their
main
ideas
and
some
of
the
main
points
that
support
their
thesis
to
make
them
open
up
and
to
get
them
engaged.
When
I
notice
a
weak
part
of
a
paper
I
ask
questions
about
the
purpose
of
that
particular
paragraph
to
navigate
the
student
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
something
missing
and
using
questions
I
help
them
come
up
with
a
solution
to
the
problem
and
suggestions
on
how
to
rewrite
the
weak
parts.
On
rare
occasions
I
also
use
the
instructing
approach
which
is
intuitive
to
most
people;
for
example,
when
I
see
that
a
paper
has
barely
any
flows
in
terms
of
organization
and
style,
I
use
the
instructive
approach
to
correct
any
minor
flaws
or
grammar
problems
in
the
paper.
This
approach
has
its
limitations
as
it
is
very
restricted
to
the
WA
providing
his/her
own
perspective
and
style
when
it
comes
to
working
on
major
organizational
and
conceptual
problems
in
the
paper.
The
WAOs
perspective
and
style
of
writing
might
not
fit
in
well
with
the
style
of
the
writer
and
that
is
why
the
WA
should
help
the
student
come
up
with
his/her
own
way
of
rewriting
a
part
rather
than
instruct
them.
Besides
setting
the
expectations
about
what
approach
will
be
used
in
a
conference,
I
believe
that
the
way
a
student
feels
about
a
WA
conference
is
related
to
the
attitude
of
the
WA
and
to
whether
the
right
expectations
are
set
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
conference.
I
once
had
a
very
frustrating
for
both
me
and
the
student
writer
conference
during
which
the
student
expected
to
be
instructed
on
which
paragraph
to
move
where
to
improve
the
cohesiveness
of
the
paper
and
which
ideas
belonged
to
the
same
paragraph
to
improve
the
clarity
of
the
ideas
conveyed.
On
the
other
hand,
I
was
trying
to
make
him
come
up
with
the
ideas
himself
by
asking
him
questions
such
as
NWhat
were
you
trying
to
say
in
this
paragraph?O
or
NWhat
do
you
think
was
the
purpose
of
the
paper?O.
Because
the
student
came
to
the
conference
expecting
an
instructive
approach
on
my
part
and
I
didnOt
do
a
good
job
setting
expectations
in
the
beginning,
throughout
the
conference
he
had
an
attitude
towards
me
that
showed
me
he
thought
that
I
didnOt
know
what
I
was
doing
and
was
not
a
good
WA.
In
order
to
address
this
issue
during
the
second
conference
I
had
with
the
student,
I
made
sure
I
set
the
right
expectations
and
explain
that
the
CWP
is
there
to
help
students
more
with
the
writing
and
thought
process
rather
than
to
correct
papers.
The
most
rewarding
experience
I
had
as
a
WA
was
during
the
second
semester
while
I
was
the
WA
for
a
VAST
course.
As
most
of
the
students
were
sophomores
and
have
not
had
the
chance
to
get
much
experience
in
college
writing,
they
were
very
receptive
of
my
advice
and
were
responsive
to
the
questions
I
would
ask
them.
I
was
especially
pleased
with
the
conferences
I
had
with
a
particular
student
whose
writing
I
could
see
improve
from
paper
to
paper.
In
the
beginning,
his
papers
were
very
writer
focused
and
were
lacking
in
organization
and
clarity.
During
the
first
two
rounds
of
conferences
I
directed
him
with
questions
and
helped
him
get
a
better
feeling
how
to
organize
his
paper
and
to
incorporate
his
ideas
effectively
without
them
being
choppy
and
unclear.
When
I
got
to
read
his
third
paper
for
the
class
I
was
very
happy
to
notice
that
he
had
made
a
significant
effort
to
improve
in
the
areas
we
had
discussed
and
had
started
to
get
himself
oriented
to
the
reader
focused
approach.
My
last
conference
with
him
has
been
my
most
rewarding
experience
as
a
WA
because
there
werenOt
as
many
questions
for
me
to
ask
as
before.
The
paper
was
structured
properly
and
had
a
very
good
organization
which
left
no
ideas
vague
for
the
readers.
The
student
shared
with
me
that
I
have
been
very
helpful
to
him
and
that
his
grades
have
been
improving
with
each
paper
to
get
to
an
A.
I
found
this
experience
rewarding
because
I
saw
in
practice
how
important
my
job
as
a
WA
is
and
how
it
can
actually
help
people
improve
and
develop
as
writers.
I
also
saw
in
practice
how
successful
the
facilitative
approach
is
when
leading
a
conference
as
it
was
the
thought
process
of
the
student
caused
by
the
questions
that
got
him
to
thinking
about
how
to
change
his
style
of
writing
as
every
personOs
style
is
unique
and
cannot
be
guided
by
instruction.
However,
I
have
had
frustrating
experiences
as
a
WA
as
well.
One
of
the
most
challenging
conferences
I
had
with
another
student
from
the
same
VAST
class.
His
drafts
always
resembled
lack
of
preparation
and
research
on
the
topic,
and
he
would
also
use
the
first
person
narrative
and
a
very
informal
style
of
writing
in
general.
In
the
beginning
during
our
first
conference
I
made
sure
that
we
address
these
issues
and
I
stressed
to
him
the
importance
of
preparation
and
research.
I
also
took
up
some
instructive
approach
as
some
of
the
grammar
and
style
mistakes
he
made
were
very
hard
to
point
out
through
facilitating.
I
was
feeling
good
about
the
conference
and
was
not
concerned
about
the
student
until
we
had
our
second
conference
and
he
came
with
the
exact
same
level
of
writing
progress
of
his
draft.
I
decided
to
do
the
same
thing
as
during
the
first
conference
by
emphasizing
the
importance
of
preparation
and
explaining
to
him
that
is
being
graded
on
the
writing
process
rather
than
only
on
the
final
draft
and
that
he
had
to
put
in
more
effort
in
the
draft
and
editing.
The
third
paper
had
the
exact
same
characteristics
as
the
first
two.
What
was
interesting
was
that
as
we
were
discussing
the
assignment,
the
student
seemed
to
have
a
good
idea
what
his
main
points
would
be
and
his
narrative
seemed
logical
and
organized.
It
was
very
hard
for
me,
however,
to
help
him
put
his
thought
process
on
paper.
I
found
that
very
frustrating
because
I
couldnOt
understand
where
the
problem
was
coming
from.
He
definitely
had
a
clear
idea
what
he
wanted
to
write
about
but
didnOt
seem
to
be
able
to
effectively
present
it
on
paper.
The
lack
of
progress
he
showed
in
his
drafts
(he
didnOt
even
switch
from
the
first
person
narrative)
was
very
frustrating
and
discouraging
for
me.
In
general,
the
College
Writing
Program
has
helped
me
develop
and
evolve
immensely
and
has
taught
me
to
be
patient
and
to
have
an
individual
approach
to
each
student
I
work
with.
I
have
found
that
being
a
WA
is
a
very
rewarding
experience
that
allows
you
to
see
other
students
you
work
with
develop
along
in
the
process.
