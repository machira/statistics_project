The
inception
of
my
literary
history
occurred
early;
probably
even
before
I
could
hold
a
pen
or
pencil
properly.
Years
before
conceptualization
of
such
notions
as
noun,
pronoun,
subject,
dangling
modifier,
double-spaced-12-point-Times-New-Roman,
I
thought
about
writing
in
terms
of
Goodnight
Moon.
Reading,
writing,
and
content
absorption
revolved
around
saying
goodnight
to
the
moon,
a
bowl
full
of
mush,
and
an
old
woman
in
the
corner
saying
Ohush.O
Goodnight
Moon
was
a
nightly
ritual
for
many
years;
a
hardened
criterion
of
the
bed-time
process,
an
introduction
to
books.
This
introduction
gave
way
to
new
books
and
new
genres,
books
with
chapters
and
no
pictures.
Goodnight
Moon,
though
simple
and
non-complex,
created
the
foundation
for
the
way
I
began
to
think
about
reading
and
consequently
helped
form
my
personal
interest
in
the
written
world.
To
say
that
Goodnight
Moon
is
entirely
responsible
for
my
success
as
a
writer
could
be
a
bit
of
a
long
shot.
However,
I
believe
its
presence
in
my
early
years
definitely
allowed
for
me
to
be
comfortable
with
books.
I
grew
up
liking
books
and
never
being
afraid
to
try
out
something
different
or
more
difficult
than
I
was
used
to.
Not
before
long
I
started
creating
my
own
stories
and
writing
about
them
in
notebooks
and
journals.
I
understood
the
basic
format
of
the
everyday
fictional
childrenOs
story;
I
needed
characters,
a
place,
an
event
and
lots
of
description.
I
am
unsure
of
what
my
very
first
self-imposed
writing
assignment
was,
however
I
remember
writing
about
things
that
happened
around
me.
For
example,
growing
up
in
Boston
near
the
Public
Garden,
I
was
very
familiar
with
the
lore
of
the
Swan
Boats
as
well
as
the
book
Make
Way
for
Ducklings.
When
the
bronze
statuettes
of
the
ducks
were
mysteriously
stolen
from
their
monument
in
the
Public
Garden,
I
remember
being
fascinated
and
troubled
at
the
same
time.
The
event
led
me
to
write
a
full,
completely
fictional
account
of
what
had
happened
to
the
bronze
ducklings;
who
stole
them,
where
they
were,
and
how
they
were
returned.
I
think
I
implicated
my
then-sketchy
next
door
neighbor
and
assumed
that
he
put
the
ducks
in
a
trash
can
and
buried
them
in
the
back
yard.
It
is
likely
that
my
first
literary
genre
was
inspired
by
the
disappearance
of
the
ducks,
for
from
that
time
on
I
remember
writing
strictly
mystery
stories.
Between
the
ages
of
six
through
nine,
writing
and
reading
was
my
thing.
If
I
wasnOt
out
playing
or
building
obnoxious
tree
forts
with
my
friends,
I
was
either
reading
a
story
or
writing
one.
Being
an
only
child
it
was
an
easy
thing
for
me
to
do;
I
didnOt
need
anyone
else
to
do
it,
and
I
could
usually
get
away
with
writing
undetected
during
post
bedtime
hours.
By
the
time
I
reached
the
stage
in
school
where
short
story
and
essay
writing
became
prevalent,
I
essentially
had
no
problem
with
it.
However,
I
found
essay
writing
much
less
exciting
than
the
stories
I
was
authoring
at
home
in
my
spare
time,
probably
because
for
the
first
time
I
was
writing
within
someone
elseOs
parameters.
In
grade
school
I
always
received
high
marks
for
everything
having
to
do
with
reading,
writing
and
communication.
I
had
learned
to
give
teachers
what
they
were
looking
for
in
terms
of
writing;
I
learned
their
game
and
I
was
playing
it
to
the
tee--although
I
always
hated
the
rule
of
repeating
parts
of
a
question
in
written
responses.
For
example,
NWhy
does
Ralph
have
a
hole
in
his
pants?O
NRalph
has
a
hole
in
his
pants
because
the
dog
bit
him
in
the
behind.O
These
sentences
always
bothered
me
due
to
the
fact
that
when
read
aloud
in
sequential
order,
whole
paragraphs
would
make
one
sound
like
a
robot.
In
between
robotic
homework
assignments,
I
still
made
time
to
fashion
my
own
stories
and
use
my
own
writing
style
as
a
sort
of
primitive
poetic
license.
My
writing
activities
as
a
nine-year-old
included
a
scathing
letter
written
to
my
auntOs
ex-boyfriend,
chastising
him
for
breaking
up
with
her
as
well
as
various
other
fictional
stories
usually
having
to
do
with
some
sort
of
local
news
or
theft.
Constant
observation,
fueled
by
my
childhood
grasp
of
the
fantastic
led
to
many
short
stories
and
fictions
modeled
after
the
genre
du
jour.
Once
I
reached
middle
school
and
eventually
high
school,
my
activity
writings
slowed
considerably
and
eventually
stopped.
Faced
with
more
in-depth
writing
courses
and
writing
rules,
I
found
myself
straying
from
creative
fictional
writing
and
was
faced
with
writing
expository
papers
tightly
bound
with
rules
about
sentence
structure,
paragraph
structure
and
word
choice.
Suddenly
the
words
that
spilled
onto
notebook
paper
so
easily
in
my
childhood
could
be
scientifically
broken
down
into
parts;
deconstructed
into
intangible
groupings
like
nouns,
verbs,
and
subjects.
Writing
was
less
about
content
and
more
about
structure.
I
remember
writing
was
no
longer
fun
for
me
because
every
sentence
I
wrote,
I
had
to
make
sure
I
had
all
the
appropriate
parts,
working
together
properly.
It
was
like
looking
behind
the
green
curtain
at
OZ
and
coming
face
to
face
with
the
nuts
and
bolts
of
a
fantasy
world;
realizing
that
the
rules
have
impeded
creativity.
According
to
my
teachers
and
the
grades
that
they
gave
me,
my
writing
was
still
very
good
but
I
felt
that
it
lacked
something
vital.
For
a
while
I
shuffled
along,
not
really
caring
about
my
essays
and
feeling
too
constricted
to
write
what
I
thought
was
good.
The
crashing
point
came
during
my
high
school
freshman
English
class.
In
Mrs.
CameronOs
ninth
grade
last
period
English
class
a
literary
bomb
went
off;
and
it
went
by
the
name
of
Great
Expectations.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
hated
a
book.
I
hated
this
book
and
I
refused
to
read
it.
My
parents
were
at
a
loss,
they
tried
everything
to
get
me
to
read
it;
they
even
tried
reading
it
to
me
Goodnight
Moon
style,
but
nothing
would
work.
Sure
enough,
there
I
was
at
mid-terms
with
a
potential
D
in
English.
It
was
not
only
blasphemous
for
me
to
have
a
D
in
any
subject
in
school,
but
English
was
unheard
of,
it
was
the
only
class
my
parents
never
worried
about.
Soon
enough
Great
Expectations
faded
away
after
mid-terms
like
a
suddenly
uninterested
shark.
To
this
day
IOm
still
not
sure
who
won
that
showdown,
whether
it
was
me
or
the
preposterous
Pip,
but
letOs
put
it
this
way;
Great
Expectations
the
movie,
complete
with
the
scrumptious
Ethan
Hawke
still
got
no
attention
from
me.
Reading
was
not
my
only
problem
that
year
either.
I
struggled
vehemently
with
the
standard
5-paragraph
expository
essay.
Looking
back
on
it
now
I
find
it
almost
hilarious
that
I
had
a
problem
with
it,
but
I
still
remember
the
red
ink
stains
on
one
paper
that
pretty
much
summed
up
my
abilities.
Written
at
the
end
of
my
paper
was
every
studentOs
worst
nightmareNthe
classic
Nyou
have
no
idea
what
youOre
doingO
comment
written
in
red
chicken
scrawl.
However,
I
knew
what
I
was
doing
was
all
wrong,
and
I
had
to
agree
with
Mrs.
Cameron
on
this
one.
Thankfully,
after
one
after-school
meeting
with
the
kind
and
affable
Mrs.
C,
something
finally
clicked.
In
one
8-week
term,
I
went
from
a
D-toting
nomad
writer
to
an
exacting
expository
poet,
complete
with
an
about-face
grade
change
from
D
to
A.
This,
like
many
of
the
writing
experiences
IOve
had
in
my
academic
career,
prove
to
be
somewhat
mysterious;
I
cannot
pin-point
exactly
what
I
started
doing
right,
but
whatever
it
was
worked
wonderfully.
The
next
two
years
followed
suit
with
the
latter
half
of
my
freshman
year.
I
continued
to
learn
and
build
upon
the
5-paragraph
expository
essay
and
move
onto
other
kinds
of
writing
such
as
argumentative
and
even
the
then-doting
10-page
research
paper.
In
addition,
I
was
able
to
slowly
begin
working
the
creative
and
unique
writing
style
that
I
had
given
up
for
dead
back
into
my
everyday
writing
assignments.
Instead
of
using
creativity
for
fictional
purposes,
I
was
able
to
fuse
creativity
with
fact
by
way
of
text
interpretation.
Whatever
the
literary
concoction
was,
it
worked
for
the
rest
of
my
time
in
high
school
English
classes.
By
the
time
I
reached
my
senior
year
writing
successfully
was
something
I
had
accomplished.
I
had
proven
to
the
English
department
by
passage
from
class
to
class
that
I
had
learned
the
rules
of
the
game
and
demonstrated
my
knowledge
successfully.
Senior
year
English
was
the
summation
of
all
things
learned
and
the
gearing
up
for
the
great
unknownNcollege.
After
the
first
two
terms
of
standard
literary
criticisms
and
research
papers,
our
English
class
took
a
detour
into
exotic
realms.
For
the
first
time
since
grade
school
I
had
fictional
narrative
assignments
designed
to
force
us
to
write
in
a
voice
completely
different
from
our
own.
After
many
years
of
abiding
by
the
rules
I
was
unsure
I
knew
how
to
break
out
of
the
binds
of
formal
academic
writing.
After
a
few
tries
and
miserable
ends,
it
came
back
to
me;
the
creative
fictional
side
that
I
learned
from
Goodnight
Moon
finally
re-emerged.
Equipped
with
all
the
rules
and
as
much
sagacity
as
one
can
have
in
high
school,
we
were
encouraged
to
break
the
rules
and
write
as
we
pleased.
It
was
at
this
point
that
I
finally
believed
that
I
was
a
pretty
good
writer;
I
could
hold
my
own,
I
knew
what
the
formula
was
and
I
could
break
it
if
I
wanted
to.
But
the
question
now
was
whether
or
not
it
would
work
for
me
in
college.
My
first
writing
assignment
in
college
was
for
my
First
Year
Seminar
and
it
scared
the
wits
out
of
me.
Sure
my
writing
put
me
through
high
school
English
classes
with
flying
colors,
but
I
went
to
a
public
high
school
and
now
I
am
at
a
private
liberal
arts
college;
what
if
thereOs
a
huge
gap
between
the
two?
Like
many
of
the
things
I
write,
I
wrote
my
first
paper
thinking
it
was
probably
only
good
enough
to
line
a
litter
box
with.
I
had
no
confidence
in
it
whatsoever,
and
was
sure
I
was
going
to
fail
out
of
college
altogether.
However,
after
a
few
minor
changes
and
additions,
I
found
that
for
the
most
part,
my
writing
abilities
and
style
worked
very
well
in
the
Lafayette
literary
community.
For
the
most
part,
I
can
write
a
successful
paper
without
any
major
conflicts
or
issues
and
feel
pretty
comfortable
about
writing
assignments
even
though
some
papers
and
topics
are
more
difficult
for
me
than
others.
As
an
academic
writer
in
college
courses
IOve
learned
a
lot
about
the
type
of
writer
I
am.
In
terms
of
medium,
I
find
I
can
only
write
seriously
in
a
word
processing
format,
unfortunately
paper
and
pencil
or
pen
create
an
automatic
brain
freeze
for
me.
More
often
than
not,
during
the
writing
process,
I
think
that
what
I
am
writing
is
heinous
and
with
every
paper
IOm
sure
IOve
lost
whatever
good-writing-luck
IOve
had.
However,
after
the
paper
is
finished
and
I
can
read
it
once
through
I
usually
have
a
better
feeling
about
what
IOve
written.
Lately,
IOve
found
writing
for
my
summer
internship
more
challenging
than
I
expected
due
to
the
fact
that
the
writing
is
extremely
informal,
colloquial
even,
and
I
sometimes
find
it
hard
to
break
out
of
academic
writing.
In
addition,
my
assignments
can
range
from
anything
from
natural
bug
repellants
to
Bjork
concerts
to
why
boy-cut
underware
is
better
than
thongs.
There
are
times
when
I
have
no
earthly
idea
as
to
what
my
assignment
is
about,
and
somehow
I
have
to
create
a
witty,
well-informed
column
on
its
existence.
IOm
hoping
that
the
versatility
that
I
have
been
forced
to
acquire
this
summer
will
lend
itself
positively
towards
my
academic
writing
this
coming
fallNof
course
I
still
have
my
age-old
fear
that
IOll
return
to
college
having
forgotten
how
to
write
over
the
summer.
Throughout
the
years,
my
literary
history
has
had
its
fair
share
of
ups
and
downs,
satisfaction
and
disappointment.
Luckily
IOve
found
a
way
to
meld
the
kind
of
writing
I
enjoyed
as
a
child
with
the
appropriate
format
for
academic
writing.
Thanks
to
bed-time
rituals,
falling
asleep
and
words
that
rhyme
with
Oa
bowl
full
of
mushO,
IOve
been
able
to
approach
books,
reading
and
writing
with
without
much
trepidation.
My
writing
hasnOt
always
been
perfect,
but
IOm
never
afraid
to
start
new
works
or
write
in
new
ways.
