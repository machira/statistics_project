My
own
history
of
literacy--such
a
topic
is
very
personal.
Yes,
I
call
it
personal
because
personality
cannot
help
but
shine
through
all
forms
of
writing.
Our
personality
remains
underneath
the
alphabetical
code.
Words,
letters,
phrases,
and
clauses
all
coalesce,
forming
a
united
whole,
forming
what
I
call
myself.
Even
poor
writing
reflects
personality,
reveals
some
iota
of
character.
Why
am
I
telling
you
this?
Well,
it
is
quite
simple.
Within
these
seven
pages,
you
will
hear
nothing
but
personality.
In
fact,
these
seven
pages
might
borderline
a
journal
entry.
So,
please
forgive
my
poetic
license
and
my
lack
of
formality.
I
figure
that
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
to
exhaust
all
of
our
formality
in
the
upcoming
semesters.
Right
now,
we
will
savor
the
moment
to
be
informal.
Therefore,
I
will
just
say
it
right
now
AS
YOU
WERE.'
As
I
was
driving
around
today,
I
had
an
attack
of
pensiveness.
I
work
for
the
Press
of
Atlantic
City,
and
a
portion
of
my
job
requires
me
to
drive
what
are
called
kidhawkers1
to
their
spots,
where
they
sell
papers.
As
I
am
driving
around
these
kids,
I
am
trying
to
start
up
a
conversation,
but
the
car
remains
silent.
I
will
call
the
reason
for
the
unbearable
silence
the
decade
factor.'
Simply
put,
I
grew
up
in
the
80's
and
they
grew
up
in
the
90's.
Our
generations
were
not
entirely
separate.
For
one,
we
both
watched
MTV.
They
love
it,
and
I
hate
it.
Thinking
back,
however,
I
remember
when
I
loved
it,
when
I
watched
it
every
day
as
an
extension
of
my
being.
Now
I
hate
it.
The
possession
of
a
decade
more
of
knowledge
allows
me
to
hate
the
channel,
not
because
it
is
offensive,
but
because
it
is
spoon-fed,
commercialized
vomit.
Nevertheless,
I
remember
when
I
watched
MTV
religiously,
and,
consequently,
I
remember
when
I
was
at
that
age.
However,
for
me
to
actually
remember
the
consciousness
of
myself
at
ten
years
of
age
would
require
me
to
subtract
my
father's
remarriage,
my
driver's
license,
and
countless
other
personal
factors,
factors
that
have
encouraged
my
own
growth
and
maturity.
No
wonder
the
car
remained
silent.
Factors
concerning
college,
car
insurance,
current
events,
politics,
and
successful
writing
filled
my
mind.
Meanwhile,
factors
concerning
video
games,
boardwalk
rides,
and
basketball
players
dominated
their
minds.
You
could
safely
assume
that
the
passengers
were
not
on
the
same
level
as
the
driver.
What
was
I
thinking
about
when
I
was
their
age?
Truthfully,
I
was
probably
thinking
the
same
thing:
where
can
I
play?
I
did
not
care
about
writing,
I
did
not
care
about
reading
books,
and
I
did
not
care
about
saving
money
for
college.
Those
concerns
were
for
my
parents
to
dwell
on.
My
change
of
mind
(or
change
of
maturity)
occurred
in
the
eighth
grade.
Everything
preceding
that
grade
was
unimportant
to
me.
In
second
grade,
I
disliked
those
black
pencils,
which
would
not
fit
into
the
standard
hole
of
the
pencil
sharpener.
In
fact,
I
disliked
pencils
and
pencil
sharpeners.
Whenever
I
sharpened
my
pencil,
it
would
leave
lead
fragments
on
the
paper,
smudge,
and
inevitably
get
my
hands
dirty.
Pen
never
did
that.
However,
I
could
not
even
think
about
using
pen
until
a
much
later
grade.
Mastering
cursive
had
to
come
first.
I
remember
my
first
paper
written
in
cursive.
The
topic
was
the
geographical
situation
of
Brazil,
but
the
finished
product
turned
out
to
be
a
skimpy-looking
200-word
summary
of
World
Book
Encyclopedia.
You
could
not
call
it
plagiarism,
because
I
did
not
even
know
what
plagiarism
was
(or
how
to
spell
it
for
that
matter).
Anyway,
I
got
a
B+.
Developing
creativity
did
not
occur
until
I
started
writing
short
stories
in
eighth
grade.
Some
may
call
my
writings
a
phase,
but
in
retrospect,
they
were
the
beginning
of
my
present
self
as
a
writer.
In
eighth
grade,
my
classmates
and
I
had
to
write
sentences
for
the
Spelling
portion
of
our
English
class.
The
concept
was
very
simple:
write
a
paragraph
that
incorporates
the
most
spelling
words
as
possible.
Instead
of
writing
a
conventional
boring
paragraph,
I
decided
to
write
a
short
story
incorporating
the
most
gore.
I
made
a
short
story
about
this
shipwrecked
married
couple,
who
ate
their
own
limbs
to
stay
alive.
Meticulously,
I
described
each
individual
act
of
tearing
flesh
and
breaking
bone.
Yes,
it
was
my
Stephen
King
phase.
Blood,
puss,
infections,
you
name
it:
I
wrote
it.
I
also
remember
writing
a
short
story
about
a
car
wreck.
In
reality,
it
was
not
a
short
story
at
all.
Rather,
it
was
more
like
a
step
by
step
description
of
each
fragile
passenger
tumbling
around
inside
a
mangled
car.
The
best
part
of
the
whole
process
was
my
permission
to
read
my
short
stories
in
front
of
the
class.
Man,
they
ate
that
stuff
up.
Just
the
shocked
look
on
each
face
was
motivation
enough
for
my
grueling
process.
Not
to
worry,
I
grew
out
of
my
gore
phase.
Occasionally,
a
member
of
my
class
would
ask
me
if
I
had
written
any
stories
lately.
I
always
replied,
No,
I
outgrew
that
phase.'
In
retrospect,
my
outgrowth
could
not
have
come
at
a
better
time.
If
I
attempted
something
to
that
effect
today,
officials
would
brand
me
suicidal
and,
thus,
and
eminent
public
threat.
Given
the
recent
school
shootings,
the
school's
right
to
safety
would
drastically
outweigh
my
right
to
creativity.
Fortunately,
no
future
problems
resulted.
Within
my
Freshman
year
of
High
School,
I
lost
my
thirst
for
shock.
The
focus
of
my
writings
changed
from
gore
to
academics.
To
tell
you
the
truth,
I
never
received
good
grades
on
my
gory
Spelling
paragraphs.
I
would
become
so
concerned
with
which
element
was
causing
which
blood
vessel
to
break
that
I
would
rarely
incorporate
more
than
three
spelling
words.
Considering
that
there
were
twenty
spelling
words
per
lesson,
my
teachers
were
not
pleased
with
the
use
of
only
three.
With
my
new
focus
in
mind,
I
excelled
in
my
English
class.
Much
changed
from
my
earlier
entertaining
writings.
It
seemed
that
now
I
only
confused
my
classmates,
as
I
awkwardly
incorporated
all
the
big1
words
possible.
The
class
responded,
huh?
What
did
he
say?
In
short,
I
was
still
immature
my
Freshman
year,
and
the
reason
I
remained
as
such
was
because
I
desperately
attempted
to
appear
otherwise
in
my
writings.
Sophomore
year
English
changed
all
that.
The
bane
of
all
High
School
students
became
my
reality:
Mrs.
Jenkins
Honors
English.
She
revealed
my
inadequacies
and
would
reprimand
me
when
I
would
occasionally
stumble
over
a
lofty
word.
If
it
taught
me
anything,
it
taught
me
modesty
and
the
necessity
of
word
precision.
She
introduced
us
to
the
formal
process
of
writing
research
papers.
Index
cards,
references,
footnotes,
and
endnotes
became
an
inescapable
reality.
They
were
all
part
of
the
formal
(and
the
only
right)
process
of
writing
a
clear
research
paper.
I
will
not
lie.
Being
in
her
classroom
was
complete
hell,
but
at
the
same
moment,
it
was
the
best
awakening
call
of
my
life
as
a
writer.
Before
sophomore
year
English,
I
was
content.
Teachers
gave
my
writings
nothing
but
accolades.
After
sophomore
year
and
the
awakening
call
of
Mrs.
Jenkins,
I
became
content
with
nothing.
I
would
dissect
everything
and
always
strive
for
something
better.
Junior
year
I
upgraded
to
all
honors
courses.
In
Junior
year
Honors
English,
I
wrote
a
research
paper
detailing
how
the
Cold
War
acted
as
an
impetus
for
man
s
eventual
walk
on
the
moon.
My
grade
was
a
pleasant
95.
My
parents
were
pleased
with
my
grades
on
papers.
Their
amount
of
pleasure
varied
as
I
went
through
my
gore
phase
and
my
prolixity
phase,
but
they
remained
generally
pleased.
I
never
introduced
my
writings
to
my
family
until
my
uncle
died,
and
I
wrote
a
one-page
tribute
to
his
life.
It
detailed
the
callousness
of
our
society
to
members
of
the
elderly
community
and
our
tendency
to
push
them
aside
in
the
hustle
and
bustle.
The
paper
made
many
people
who
know
him
cry.
Thinking
back,
I
am
not
sure
if
the
quality
of
writing
made
my
family
cry
or
the
mere
reference
to
his
life.
I
hope
for
the
former.
After
my
Uncle's
death
and
the
end
of
my
Senior
year,
I
moved
here
to
Lafayette.
What
immediately
struck
me
was
the
articulate
nature
of
Lafayette
professors.
Professors
eloquently
articulated
lectures
instead
of
plainly
communicated
them
as
my
High
School
teachers
did.
Even
simple
communication
became
a
test
of
precision.
Acceptable
communication
skills
one
year
ago
became
something
obsolete
in
the
collegiate
classroom.
In
general,
the
Lafayette
experience
challenged
but
not
overburdened
my
intellectual
faculties.
Once
again,
I
was
refocused.
What
will
the
next
year
hold?
What
will
this
year
hold?
I
surely
do
not
know
the
answer
to
these
questions.
Based
upon
the
past,
I
do
know
that
my
writing
comprised
various
stages.
I
can
only
assume
that
the
future
will
hold
another
attack
of
such
a
stage.
I
rest
assured
that
I
am
not
alone
with
my
various
writing
stages.
I
learned
that
many
prominent
writers,
Ernest
Hemmingway
included,
scraped
hundreds
of
pages
at
a
time.
The
writers
justified
this
process
by
stating
that
the
pages
never
fit.
Literary
works
needed
constant
revision,
a
continuing
quest
for
perfection
and
contentment.
Life
and
literature
is
a
stage.
The
kids
that
worked
for
me
this
summer
were
simply
in
a
different
stage.
They
did
not
care
about
my
cares
or
find
any
usefulness
in
them
whatsoever.
However,
I
was
in
that
stage
of
writing
once,
and
that
stage
contributed
to
my
present
self
as
a
writer.
To
deny
myself
my
childhood
would
drastically
alter
my
present
self.
I
do
not
know
what
I
would
be
without
all
the
preceding
stages.
Without
them,
I
would
definitely
not
be
my
present
self
as
a
writer.
I
might
not
even
be
at
Lafayette.
