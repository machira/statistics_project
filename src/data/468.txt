My
Literacy
Narrative
Writing
has
been
one
of
the
most
pivotal
aspects
of
my
academic
life
for
as
long
as
I
can
remember.
Ever
since
I
was
very
young,
it
has
been
an
activity
that
I
have
thoroughly
enjoyed,Eas
opposed
to
an
educational
obstacle
or
task
that
I
had
take
on.
It
has
helped
me
achieve
a
sense
of
intellectual
confidence
and
has
been
an
unwavering
entity
in
all
of
the
life
changes
I
have
encountered.
Although
I
am
well-aware
that
my
writing
is
far
from
flawless,
I
enjoy
reflecting
on
how
it
has
grown
and
flourished,
especially
in
the
recent
years.
I
have
come
toEview
it
more
as
a
guide
that
will
accompany
me
through
thick
and
thin,
rather
than
something
that
is
constantly
being
graded
or
judged.
I
take
pleasure
in
appreciating
its
progress
and
development
and
look
forward
to
the
benefits
it
will
reap
through
the
Writing
Associate
program
this
upcoming
semester.
As
ironic
as
it
seems,
I
attribute
my
love
and
admiration
for
writing
to
my
earliest
Eacademic
struggles
in
other
educational
realms
as
a
young
child.
Very
early
on,
I
had
a
minor
speech
impediment
which
forced
me
to
go
to
a
specialist
twice
a
week
in
which
I
would
practice
tongue
exercises
and
paraphrasing.
I
found
this
to
be
very
irritating
and
bizarre,
and
I
did
not
feel
completely
comfortable
talking
as
much
as
the
other
children
my
age.
Therefore,
I
began
toEwrite
in
a
journal,
practicing
my
upper
and
lower
case
letters
and
eventually
my
script.EConstantly
writing
in
my
journal
made
me
very
happy
and
calm,
whereas
talking
made
me
feel
insecure
and
anxious.
Although
I
knew
that
I
was
behind
on
the
oral
side
of
things,
I
highly
benefited
from
the
persistent
writing
practice
and
felt
that
I
was
ahead
in
that
department.
After
the
dentist
had
traced
my
speech
impediment
to
a
cleft
pallet
and
I
had
surgery
to
get
it
taken
care
of,
I
began
to
feel
much
more
comfortable
talking
and
had
slowed
down
on
the
journal
writing.
However,
I
do
recall
focusing
more
on
reading
and
writing
even
after
my
surgery
as
well
because
I
enjoyed
these
educational
subjects
much
more
than
anything
in
the
realms
of
math
or
science.
Math
did
not
come
easily
to
me
and
even
in
the
first
and
second
grades
I
distinctly
remember
struggling
on
a
daily
basis
with
the
problems
that
seemed
so
simple
to
other
children.
This
led
me
to
feel
unintelligent
and
consequently
I
began
to
avoid
anything
remotely
related
to
math.
I
would
get
easily
frustrated
and
not
want
to
continue
trying
to
learn
in
fear
of
failure
and
feelings
of
inferiority.
My
second
grade
teacher
significantly
helped
me
to
achieve
a
sense
of
academic
Econfidence
despite
needing
extra
attention
regarding
math
and
science.
Instead
of
dwelling
on
my
slow
progress
in
those
areas,
she
focused
on
my
intellectual
strengths
as
a
reader
and
writer
in
addition
to
putting
in
extra
time
with
me
in
math.
I
credit
most
of
my
self-assurance
as
a
young
student
to
this
particular
teacher
who
helped
me
realize
that
being
NsmartO
is
not
cut
and
dry
by
any
means.
By
emphasizing
that
I
was
strong
in
reading
and
writing
my
teacher
taught
me
to
understand
that
a
person
can
have
different
strengths
and
weaknesses
yet
still
be
successful
if
diligent
effort
is
put
in.
I
feel
that
these
values
and
ideas
she
impressed
upon
me
have
stuck
with
me
throughout
my
academic
career
and
have
made
a
large
impact
on
my
ownEpersonal
academic
understanding
and
acceptance.
For
the
middle
and
latter
part
of
my
grammar
school
years,
I
unfortunately
do
not
Eremember
doing
much
writing
at
all.
I
went
to
a
very
strict
Catholic
school
from
first
to
eighthEgrade
which
had
a
very
archaic
approach
to
education.
The
teaching
focused
almost
solely
onEevery
single
aspect
of
grammar
and
in
the
time
where
we
were
not
doing
that,
only
public
speaking
was
practiced.
I
distinctly
remember
my
mother
picking
up
on
the
dearth
of
writing
I
was
doing
and
how
perplexed
she
was
about
it.
Therefore,
she
sent
me
to
a
Creative
Writing
class
which
I
attended
once
a
week
that
focused
on
various
genres
of
English,
Literature,
and
even
Drama.
I
absolutely
adored
going
to
this
class
and
feel
that
during
this
time
I
began
to
Eassociate
the
different
types
of
work
I
was
doing
as
satisfying,
especially
in
comparison
to
the
monotonous
rules
of
grammar
and
the
repetitive
memorization
that
public
speaking
entailed.
I
began
to
practice
a
lot
of
simple
poetry,
and
even
wrote
a
play
with
the
help
of
my
writing
teacher
and
fellow
classmates.
My
favorite
part
of
the
class
was
the
last
twenty
minutes,
which
were
dedicated
to
creative
and
personal
free-writing.
During
this
time
each
student
could
write
whatever
they
wanted,
in
whatever
writing
genre
they
desired,
without
having
to
show
it
to
the
teacher
or
anyone
else.
In
retrospect,
I
think
that
this
was
an
extremely
constructive
exercise
that
should
be
practiced
more
often
in
all
classrooms,
especially
during
the
grammar
school
years.
I
firmly
believe
that
the
one
year
I
spent
in
Creative
Writing
class
was
more
beneficial
than
all
of
my
grammar
school
years
combined
in
terms
of
measuring
my
own
learning
experience
and
development.
It
gave
me
a
much
more
eclectic
and
informed
idea
of
what
all
branches
of
English
are
really
about
and
led
me
in
the
direction
of
the
liberal
arts
which
I
haveEcome
to
know
and
love.E
Due
to
my
positive
experience
in
the
Creative
Writing
class
that
I
took
in
grammar
school,
I
was
able
to
develop
an
entirely
new
and
refreshing
relationship
with
writing
throughout
my
high
school
years.
I
looked
forward
to
most
of
the
writing
projects
I
encountered
such
as
essays,
poems,
short
stories,
and
even
grew
to
have
an
affinity
for
satire.
However,
I
did
detest
any
type
of
research
project
that
was
assigned
and
still
to
this
day
find
Eresearch
papers
to
be
one
of
the
least
beneficial
forms
of
?school
writing?.
I
feel
this
way
because
in
my
own
personal
experiences
with
research
papers,
each
teacher
or
professor
has
had
a
specific
and
structured
way
that
he
or
she
wants
it
done
which
made
it
difficult
for
me
to
feel
comfortable
with
what
I
was
writing.
Many
times
I
felt
that
the
directions
given
were
also
ambiguous
or
misleading
which
enhanced
how
dissatisfied
and
nervous
I
was
about
doing
the
paper.
I
never
came
to
believe
that
any
of
my
research
work
was
unique
or
original,
and
in
actuality
I
often
felt
that
it
was
almost
glorified
plagiarism.
Although
I
must
admit
that
I
did
learn
and
absorb
a
plethora
of
information
from
all
of
the
work
that
my
research
papers
entailed,
I
never
enjoyed
what
I
was
doing.
I
would
have
much
rather
read
a
book
or
watched
a
movie
instead
of
having
to
compile
different
sources,
site
all
of
them
in
a
meticulous
order,
and
make
such
a
structured
and
mechanical
product.
My
aversion
to
research
papers
helped
me
to
realize
the
type
of
writer
that
I
am
and
the
genres
of
writing
that
I
get
the
most
pleasure
out
of.
Many
teachers
and
professors
have
made
comments
about
my
writing
over
the
years,
all
saying
that
I
had
a
knack
for
eloquence
and
great
flow
of
ideas,
but
often
I
get
caught
up
in
my
writing
and
can
be
overly
wordy
or
verbose.
These
critiques
make
sense
in
explaining
my
preferred
types
of
writing
because
if
it
was
up
to
me,
I
would
only
use
informal
types
of
expression
such
as
journaling
and
free-
writing
as
opposed
to
research
or
argumentative
work.
I
have
always
been
a
very
outgoing
and
open
person,
unceasingly
willing
to
share
my
feelings
and
opinions
with
those
around
me.
This
is
very
obvious
in
all
of
my
writing,
and
truly
accounts
for
why
I
love
to
write
in
journals
because
I
am
able
to
express
myself
without
worrying
about
adhering
to
any
structure
or
boundaries.
I
have
learned
throughout
the
years,
and
most
specifically
in
recent
experiences,
that
the
personal
nature
of
my
writing
has
both
positive
and
negative
effects.
I
think
that
being
able
to
express
myself
clearly
in
my
writing
has
helped
me
to
truly
understand
my
feelings
and
cope
with
some
arduous
life
struggles.
However,
this
has
complicated
how
I
react
to
others
opinions
of
my
writing,
and
has
consequently
made
me
very
sensitive
about
my
work.
I
find
that
I
am
over-protective
of
all
of
my
writing
since
I
invest
so
much
of
myself
in
it.
This
newfound
conscientiousness
I
developed
about
my
writing
became
very
evident
to
me
in
a
recent
encounter
I
had
with
my
mother
after
showing
her
a
very
private
paper
I
did
for
my
VaST
course
this
past
spring.
I
wrote
about
how
complex
yet
underestimated
menarche
is
in
our
society
today,
and
the
individual
anxiety
that
it
has
caused
me
in
my
lifetime.
About
a
month
after
I
had
given
it
to
my
mother
to
read
for
leisure,
I
remembered
that
she
had
not
mentioned
anything
about
it.
I
was
confused
because
I
was
convinced
that
the
paper
would
have
been
something
she
would
have
commented
on
right
away,
so
I
asked
her
what
she
thought
about
it.
She
bluntly
told
me
that
she
could
not
get
past
the
first
page
because
it
was
Ntoo
dark
and
deep
for
herO.
After
all
of
the
diligent
effort
I
had
put
into
it
and
the
intimate
information
that
was
revealed,
I
unfortunately
took
her
apathy
as
a
direct
insult.
Although
she
tried
to
reassure
me
that
this
was
not
the
case,
I
refused
to
believe
that
she
felt
my
work
was
at
all
interesting
or
valid.
I
was
surprised
at
how
upset
the
whole
situation
made
me
and
had
to
convince
myself
that
my
mother
and
I
must
have
different
views
on
writing
and
self-expression,
therefore
would
never
be
able
to
see
eye
to
eye
on
certain
profound
writing
pieces.
To
this
day
I
am
still
bitter
about
the
incident,
but
it
has
helped
me
to
accept
that
as
long
as
I
am
comfortable
and
satisfied
with
my
work
and
effort,
other
peoples
opinions
should
not
be
considered
as
relevant
or
important
as
my
own.
I
must
reluctantly
admit
that
even
though
I
was
deeply
hurt
and
affected
from
how
unimpressed
my
mother
was
with
my
work,
over-evaluating
the
situation
made
me
appreciate
how
essential
writing
has
been
throughout
my
life.
It
is
most
definitely
one
of
the
only
exercises
that
has
been
a
constant
and
persevering
entity
in
all
of
the
life
changes
I
have
gone
through.
Many
different
writing
genres
have
accompanied
me
through
the
various
stages
I
have
experienced
in
growing
up
and
have
assisted
my
evolution
both
academically
and
personally.
For
example,
I
truly
believe
that
if
I
had
not
dabbled
in
poetry
during
my
late
grammar
school
years
I
would
not
have
acquired
the
appreciation
for
it
that
I
currently
have
to
this
day.
I
also
feel
that
if
I
had
not
written
in
a
journal
during
my
teenage
years
I
would
have
had
a
much
tougher
time
understanding
myself,
my
values,
and
the
kind
of
person
that
I
wanted
to
become.
Reflecting
on
these
past
writing
experiences,
whether
they
were
positive
or
negative,
has
forced
me
to
recognize
how
important
all
forms
of
writing
have
been
in
my
advancement
as
both
a
student
and
a
person.
In
contemplating
about
my
experience
as
a
writer
at
Lafayette,
I
am
reminded
at
how
petrified
I
was
about
college
level
writing
before
I
had
arrived
my
freshman
year.
Although
I
felt
proficient
in
my
writing
skills,
I
did
not
know
what
to
expect
and
this
scared
me.
I
had
no
idea
how
professors
judged
and
graded
writing
in
college
and
was
nervous
that
mine
may
not
measure
up
to
the
other
students
at
Lafayette.
In
retrospect,
I
definitely
underestimated
how
qualified
I
was
and
what
a
comprehensive
writing
department
my
high
school
had.
I
was
worried
about
issues
such
as
the
grading
techniques
and
the
lengthy
number
of
pages
that
my
papers
would
have
to
be.
After
two
years
of
writing
on
the
college
level,
these
past
concerns
seem
irrelevant
and
almost
silly.
In
fact,
one
of
the
things
I
most
enjoy
about
writing
on
the
college
level
is
that
grading
is
usually
the
utmost
priority
of
the
professor,
at
least
in
my
own
personal
experience
at
Lafayette.
Instead
of
focusing
primarily
on
the
finished
and
graded
product,
my
courses
at
Lafayette
have
emphasized
how
to
go
about
developing
interesting
and
informative
work
in
an
organized
manner.
I
no
longer
stress
about
being
able
to
make
my
work
Elong
enough
because
I
find
writing
to
be
something
that
I
look
forward
to
and
enjoy.
I
believe
that
this
can
be
attributed
to
the
importance
of
writing
structure
that
all
of
my
professors
at
Lafayette
have
stressed.
In
conclusion,
I
can
not
express
the
extent
of
my
excitement
in
being
chosen
as
a
Writing
Associate
for
the
upcoming
semester.
I
have
found
my
experience
with
the
College
Writing
Program
to
be
very
beneficial
and
constructive
and
plan
to
do
everything
in
my
power
to
have
a
positive
impact
on
everyone
that
I
come
into
contact
with
as
a
fellow
NWAO.
I
am
very
enthusiastic
about
helping
other
people
while
simultaneously
challenging
myself,
and
look
forward
to
expanding
my
own
horizons
regarding
writing
while
doing
so.
