Assignment
How
can
I
begin
to
portray
my
life
as
a
writer?
While
I
gazed
out
the
window
on
my
ride
to
Lafayette
College
I
searched
for
the
answer
somewhere
hidden
in
the
mountainous
backdrop
of
Route
80
through
Morris
County
New
Jersey.
Urgency
replaced
casual
brain
storming
forty
five
minutes
later.
I
pleaded
with
the
cornfields
along
Route
78
to
reveal
to
me
what
I
could
not
put
together
in
my
brain,
now
helpless,
spinning
its
wheels.
A
four
month
long
hiatus
from
academia
had
taken
its
toll,
I
would
accept
defeat
for
the
time
being.
It
was
only
noon,
twelve
long
hours
from
the
deadline
I
had
personally
assigned
myself.
Pardee
Hall
became
visible
through
a
group
of
trees
to
my
right
and
the
bridge
into
Pennsylvania
was
approaching,
it
was
just
about
time
to
move
in.
With
each
climb
and
descent
of
the
three
flights
of
stairs
which
separated
my
new
Watson
Hall
estate
from
the
van,
I
consulted
my
conscious.
Yet
it
still
defied
me,
my
memories
were
obscured.
I
could
not
recall
my
earliest
experiences
writing.
While
making
my
bed,
rolling
out
carpets,
hanging
up
posters,
I
begged
my
brain
to
give
me
something,
anything
from
my
elementary
school
years.
And
now,
8
or
so
hours
of
obstinate
battle
has
brought
me
to
a
conclusion.
Early
memories
of
writing
have
simply
evaded
me,
lost
in
abyss
in
my
brain
where
all
my
times
at
Catholic
School
have
been
sent
to;
it
was
something
about
the
uniforms
I
guess.
So
without
further
ado,
I
shall
commence
the
story
of
my
life
as
a
writer,
picking
up
in
7th
grade
English
class.
Entering
my
first
year
of
Junior
High,
elementary
and
middle
school
had
instilled
in
me
the
idea
that
poetry
was
undesirable
yet
inevitable
in
a
Language
Arts
curriculum.
And
so
on
that
fateful
afternoon
when
my
teacher
spelled
out
H-A-I-K-U,
I
let
out
an
exasperated
sigh
and
rolled
my
eyes
back,
then
quickly
came
back
to
the
lesson,
it
had
to
be
done.
Three
long
class
periods
later,
the
assignment
came:
write
your
own
haiku.
Simply
learning
about
this
Japanese
poetic
creation
with
its
5-7-5
syllable
format
had
given
me
enough
grief
to
last
a
semester;
and
now
I
had
to
write
one?
Luckily
inspiration
came
quickly,
at
a
track
meet
that
very
weekend.
While
lining
up
for
the
100
meter
dash,
the
dramatics
of
the
event
surfaced
in
an
unprecedented
manner.
For
those
not
familiar
with
the
race,
it
entails
great
nervous
buildup
but
is
at
its
core
a
short
matter
and
in
a
sense
articulate.
So,
I
figured;
why
not
make
this
sprint
the
topic
of
my
haiku?
That
night
I
put
ink
to
some
paper
with
fresh
thoughts
in
my
head
and
saw
my
ideas
manifest
into
a
poem,
one
which
I
was
very
proud
of.
I
wish
today
I
could
recall
the
exact
words,
but
unfortunately
I
can
not.
Yet
the
feeling
of
accomplishment
which
followed
has
never
left
me.
My
work
had,
in
my
opinion,
epitomized
an
event
I
highly
regarded.
The
words
evoked
fully
the
great
juxtaposition
present
in
a
sprint
race
with
its
ferocity
and
beauty.
The
effect
of
this
poem
left
me
hooked
on
writing.
My
appreciation
for
the
power
of
written
word
persisted
on
into
high
school,
where
I
was
on
to
confront
new
challenges
through
more
demanding
curriculum.
Required
daily
journal
entries
were
the
first
indicator
that
freshman
English
class
would
up
the
ante
from
years
past.
Every
day
we
were
expected
to
respond
to
a
prompt
and
not
just
jot
down
thoughts,
but
write
well
thought
out
pieces.
Our
teacher
would
collect
our
marble
notebooks
every
two
weeks
and
grade
them.
Suddenly,
each
time
I
put
pen
to
paper
it
assumed
great
significance.
Naturally,
I
grew
as
a
writer
under
these
conditions.
One
piece
of
writing
that
benefited
from
my
ever
growing
writing
prowess
was
a
reaction
piece
to
the
terrorist
attacks
of
September
11th,
2001.
While
I
did
not
suffer
any
personal
loss
on
that
tragic
day,
the
emotions
that
I
associate
with
it
simply
as
human
being
and
an
American
will
permeate
my
thoughts
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
I
was
incredibly
grateful
for
the
medium
of
writing
for
it
enabled
me
to
put
down
on
paper
these
strong
emotions
which
I
had
carried
for
years.
The
catharsis
drew
acclaim
from
my
teacher
and
my
classmates
but
I
truly
felt
praise
only
belonged
on
their
end.
The
atmosphere
which
had
helped
me
hone
the
abilities
to
write
such
a
piece
could
only
be
attributed
to
them.
This
event
reinforced
to
me
that
making
use
of
emotion
in
my
writing
could
do
a
lot
to
embellish
it.
I
began
to
trust
myself
as
a
writer
more
and
more
and
in
my
sophomore
year
this
was
put
to
an
important
test.
Westwood
High
School's
newspaper
was
making
a
comeback
in
the
fall
of
2005
and
I
was
eager
to
try
my
hand
at
sports
journalism.
I
was
to
cover
my
own
team,
varsity
boys
soccer.
A
disappointing
campaign
left
me
very
much
conflicted
at
season's
end.
I
had
to
ask
myself
whether
I
should
write
an
objective
piece,
which
was
my
duty
as
a
reporter,
or
embellish
the
story
of
a
team
that
under
performed.
My
conscious
waged
a
war
and
in
the
end
the
writer
in
me
won.
I
wrote
a
critical
analysis
of
the
team's
performance
but
also
made
sure
to
highlight
success
on
the
personal
level
for
our
squad
was
not
without
individuals
who
played
at
a
high
level.
A
short
time
after
I
submitted
the
article
to
the
editor,
it
was
in
print
for
the
whole
school
to
read.
Unprecedented
anxiety
ensued
with
my
name
tied
to
a
rather
scandalous
article
as
far
as
high
school
sports
pages
go.
Then
a
friend
of
mine
on
the
football
time
stopped
me
in
the
hallway
and
told
me
had
no
idea
I
could
write
like
that,
certainly
a
compliment
of
some
sort.
My
apprehension
was
eased
a
bit.
Then
my
teammates
came
up
to
me
and
offered
their
opinion.
None
were
offended,
the
consensus
was
that
I
had
written
an
accurate
account
of
the
season
and
had
done
so
with
impressive
language.
People
asked
me
if
I
wanted
to
be
a
writer
in
the
future
and
I
began
to
consider
it
as
a
possible
career
path.
My
British
literature
teacher
gave
me
further
reason
to
weigh
this
notion
carefully.
A
high
school
junior
confronts
many
daunting
challenges
in
his
or
her
academic
year.
SAT's
and
AP
tests
stalk
one's
dreams
to
the
extent
that
you'll
wake
up
every
other
night
in
a
cold
sweat
demanding
your
brain
to
concoct
the
definition
of
ubiquitous,
or
go
over
in
depth
the
many
George
Washington
precedents.
As
an
honors
student
in
English,
I
also
had
to
add
on
to
this
list
a
15
page
research
paper,
a
steep
demand
considering
my
longest
piece
prior
to
junior
year
had
topped
out
at
five
pages.
We
were
to
choose
a
classic
British
novel,
pick
a
topic
to
write
on,
and
employ
excerpts
from
literary
criticism
to
support
our
argument.
I
chose
Great
Expectations
by
Charles
Dickens,
mostly
because
everyone
was
reading
A
Tale
of
Two
Cities;
I
wanted
to
be
original
I
suppose.
Getting
through
the
novel
was
certainly
a
difficult
task
because
it
was
frankly
very
long
and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
moments,
very
boring.
Yet
it
was
a
gold
mine
in
regards
to
its
substance,
making
the
paper
writing
process
a
lot
easier
than
I
had
expected.
The
finished
product
was,
to
me,
impressive.
I
had
managed
to
write
18
pages
of
a
strongly
supported
stance
on
the
novel.
My
teacher
loved
it,
she
gave
me
a
97,
deducting
three
points
because
I
had
missed
a
deadline
in
handing
in
the
rough
draft
of
my
annotated
bibliography.
Her
comments
were
effusive,
flooding
the
margins
of
my
pages,
culminating
with
an
meExcellent
job!
Professionally
written.mo
Professionally
written....the
phrase
caught
me
off
guard
a
bit.
Had
I
written
that
well?
I
was
flattered
by
the
comment
but
today
I
view
it
a
little
differently
as
I
have
heard
many
other
peers
tell
me
they
received
similar
comments.
It
makes
me
recall
a
moment
from
Seinfeld
when
Elaine
is
called
mebeautifulmo
by
a
doctor
in
the
Hampton's
who
uses
the
same
adjective
to
describe
a
baby
that
is
unanimously
considered
to
be
exceptionally
meugly.mo
But
that's
all
besides
the
point,
I
was
gaining
a
supreme
confidence
in
my
writing
and
I
elected
to
take
AP
English
the
next
year,
something
I
never
would
have
envisioned
for
myself
when
I
began
high
school.
On
the
first
day
of
AP
English,
my
classmates
and
I
were
shown
a
sample
meAmo
paper.
The
vocabulary,
structure,
and
flow
of
the
piece
amazed
me
and
I
became
a
bit
nervous.
What
had
I
gotten
myself
in
to?
How
could
I
expect
myself
to
write
like
this?
It
certainly
would
require
a
lot
of
meticulous
attention
to
both
analyzing
the
literature
and
constructing
the
paper.
Our
first
novel
was
Hemingway's
A
Farewell
to
Arms,
a
brilliant
piece
of
writing
replete
with
rich
themes
and
symbols.
I
found
myself,
especially
with
this
novel,
enjoying
the
process
of
discovery
author's
intent
and
reading
the
opinions
of
literary
critics.
The
first
paper
got
me
a
92
with
deductions
only
for
MLA
problems.
And
as
the
school
year
progressed
I
kept
getting
A's
with
great
compliments
from
my
teacher.
But
more
important
than
all
of
that
was
how
much
I
was
enjoying
what
I
was
doing.
I
got
to
read
fantastic
novels
written
by
genius
writers
like
Camus,
Ellison,
Orwell,
and
Kafka,
and
offer
my
own
take
on
them.
At
the
end
of
the
year
I
knew
I
was
going
to
Lafayette
College
to
major
in
Biochemistry,
I
was
always
going
to
pick
science
in
the
end.
However
I
was
determined
to
continue
my
studies
in
English
and
when
my
AP
scores
came
back
that
July
a
couple
of
courses
in
my
jam
packed
Bachelor
of
Science
degree
were,
to
my
delight,
taken
out
of
the
picture.
There
were
just
enough
slots
to
fit
an
English
minor
and
that
was
exactly
what
I
was
going
to
do.
Literary
questions
205
intimidated
me
on
paper
as
a
freshman
just
starting
out
college.
The
first
class
made
me
even
more
nervous.
I
sat
in
my
chair
and
listened
to
much
more
seasoned
English
students
bring
up
some
profound
points
about
Rime
of
the
Ancient
Mariner.
I
couldn't
help
but
think
I
was
in
a
bit
over
my
head,
really
a
common
theme
for
me
when
facing
a
new
challenge
in
English.
It
was
also
hard
to
gauge
where
I
stood
in
the
class.
My
professor
complimented
my
written
responses
to
our
material
and
I
even
gained
the
courage
to
raise
my
hand
every
so
often.
Then,
I
got
my
first
real
glimpse
of
what
college
English
was
all
about
with
my
first
paper;
the
subject
being
of
all
things:
poetry.
You
will
recall
my
aforementioned
feelings
towards
poetry,
so
needless
to
say
I
was
not
happy
to
find
out
it
would
be
the
topic
for
my
first
college
paper.
But
I
wrote
it,
and
was
proud
of
it,
and
somewhat
confident
in
it.
I
picked
out
spots
in
the
paper
where
I
knew
my
AP
teacher
would
underline
and
write
in
the
margin
meWell
writtenmo
or
meGreat
interpretation.mo
Well,
I
was
naFu
e,
and
my
professor
made
me
very
aware
of
that.
Never
was
the
disparity
between
college
and
high
school
more
tangible
than
during
the
conference
I
had
with
my
professor
discussing
this
draft.
She
had
marked
it
up
so
much
I
could
barely
read
what
I
had
typed,
and
they
weren't
positive
comments.
There
were
meawk'smo
written
in
the
margins
and
I
had
no
idea
what
that
meant.
Could
it
be
awkward?
No,
it
couldn't
be,
my
writing
was
never
awkward,
I
had
only
ever
received
praise
for
my
writing.
But
it
was,
wasn't
it?
That
was
my
wake
up
call,
I
had
to
adapt
to
a
very
new
and
different
discourse.
I
had
my
professor's
support
too,
she
recognized
my
aptitude
in
writing
and
understood
the
challenge
facing
college
freshman
to
adopt
a
new
way
of
writing,
especially
those
students
who
had
bypassed
college
writing
110.
I
revised
and
revised
until
I
could
no
longer.
I
got
the
paper
back
a
couple
weeks
later:
B+.
It
was
disappointing
but
it
also
motivated
me.
My
next
and
final
paper
was
on
James
Joyce's
Dubliners,
a
collection
of
short
stories
with
great
substance
that
I
had
an
affinity
towards
as
a
result
of
my
Irish
lineage.
The
better
topic
gave
me
a
confidence
boost
and
I
submitted
my
draft
hoping
to
make
a
better
impression
this
time
around.
But
again,
my
paper
bled
with
red
ink.
It
was
warranted
though,
my
professor
substantiated
every
comment
and
I
couldn't
argue.
I
took
her
advice
and
again
revised
over
and
over.
This
time
I
got
an
A-
and
I
felt
a
great
sense
of
accomplishment.
I
was
grateful
for
the
help
my
professor
had
given
me
adjusting
to
college
writing.
We
met
one
last
time
to
discuss
my
final
grade,
but
something
much
more
came
out
of
it.
She
told
me
the
college
writing
program
always
looked
for
science
majors
who
could
write
well
and
she
told
me
she
would
recommend
me
to
be
a
WA.
It
was
one
of
the
greatest
compliments
I
had
received
in
my
life.
And
so
here
I
am,
finally
finishing
up
this
paper
that
will
complete
my
initiation
process
to
the
college
writing
program.
It
is
truly
one
of
the
highest
honors
to
have
been
bestowed
on
me
and
I
could
continue
on
and
on
about
how
thrilled
I
am
to
have
this
position,
especially
considering
I
thought
I
would
have
to
wait
on
it
after
being
turned
down
earlier
in
the
summer.
I
have
a
lot
of
growing
to
do
as
a
writer
and
I
know
I
will
do
so
in
helping
others
with
the
same
goal.
I
look
forward
to
developing
further
as
a
writer
and
can
only
imagine
where
this
narrative
will
head
in
the
coming
years.
