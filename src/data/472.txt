My
Writing
Associate
Experiences:
2004-2005
.
Although
I
have
had
numerous
short
writing
assignments
during
my
career
at
Lafayette,
mostly
related
to
technology,
and,
donOt
get
me
wrong,
these
assignments
have
greatly
benefited
me,
I
have
never
been
challenged
to
open
up
my
imagination
-
to
put
some
creativity
into
my
writing
assignments.
Even
for
the
opinion
based
papers
for
my
VAST
course,
the
vast
(no
pun
intended)
majority
of
our
ideas
were
required
to
come
mostly
from,
what
I
would
consider,
uninspiring
sources.
I
suppose
that
if
I
wanted
to
do
such
writing
on
a
regular
basis,
I
should
not
have
chosen
the
academic
path
that
I
have
decided
to
pursue.
This
is
part
of
the
reason
I
chose
to
join
the
Writing
Associate
program
my
sophomore
year,
and
have
since
continued
to
be
part
of
the
program
every
semester
since.
I
knew
that
the
type
of
writing
I
would
be
doing
in
my
academic
program
would
be
somewhat
limited
in
variety.
Joining
the
Writing
Associate
program
has
satisfied
my
desire
to
read
all
different
types
of
writing
D
ranging
from
the
technical
to
the
creative.
During
my
2nd
year
as
a
writing
associate,
I
was
given
the
great
honor
of
working
with
Professor
Pfaffmann
once
again.
I
read
papers
discussing
futuristic
technologies
and
the
possible
repercussions.
I
had
taken
a
class,
as
part
of
my
computer
science
curriculum
that
gave
an
overview
of
the
field
of
Artificial
Intelligence.
I
did
the
programming
assignments,
studied
for
the
tests,
and
struggled
my
way
through
the
challenging
course,
all
without
thinking
about
the
possible
impacts
this
technology
would
have
on
our
society.
I
then
had
the
opportunity
to
be
a
writing
associate
for
a
certain
computer
science
professor,
who
also
happened
to
be
a
professor
of
one
of
my
courses
at
the
time,
and
also
a
professor
who
I
consider
to
be
a
friend.
His
VAST
course
was
focused
around
issues
relating
to
advanced
technologies,
such
as
artificial
intelligence
D
the
concept
of
creating
a
being
that
could
not
be
separated
from
his
human
counterparts
in
terms
of
cognitive
ability,
and
where
this
technology
will
take
our
society.
I
had
done
much
work
with
decision
trees,
neural
nets,
and
gaming
in
my
artificial
intelligence
class,
and
I
was
able
to
assist
the
students
with
the
more
technical/scientific
side
of
their
papers.
In
turn,
the
students
D
my
students
D
were
able
to
enlighten
me
with
their
imagination
of
what
is
to
come
D
what
the
ultimate
consequences
of
these
technologies
will
be.
This
is
a
type
of
writing
that
I
never
in
my
college
career
would
have
experienced
had
I
not
joined
the
Writing
Associate
program.
It
gave
me
great
pride
to
be
able
to
help
the
students
in
a
way
that
went
beyond
simple
sentence
mechanics
and
basic
organization.
We
(myself
and
my
students)
were
able
to
combine
our
knowledge
of
the
field.
The
result
of
this
powerful
combination
was
several
greatly
written
papers.
Each
had
a
perfect
mix
of
scientific
fact
and
futuristic
projections
based
on
this
fact.
Of
course,
thesis
and
organization
were
also
emphasized
during
the
meetings.
In
addition
to
helping
students
write
and
bring
together
relevant
ideas
about
topics
I
do
know
a
good
bit
about,
it
was
just
as
interesting
to
be
involved
with
an
FYS
that
concerned
topics
I
knew
very
little
to
nothing
about.
During
the
first
semester
of
my
second
year
as
a
writing
associate,
I
was
assigned
the
NInfinite
SetsO
special
topics
mathematics
course
with
Lorenzo
Traldi.
Although
I
found
the
material
fascinating,
it
was
hard
to
fully
understand
everything
the
students
were
writing
about
since
it
was
a
very
high
level
mathematics
course.
Although
it
is
not
required
for
the
WA
to
have
in
depth
knowledge
of
the
course
material,
I
always
feel
a
bit
more
confident
working
with
the
students
when
I
have
a
good
understanding
of
what
they
are
writing
about.
Luckily,
there
were
only
5
students
in
this
class,
so
I
was
able
to
give
a
fair
amount
of
attention
to
each
of
the
papers,
and
learn
something
while
doing
so.
Instead
of
just
the
usual
teacher-student
relationship
one
might
expect
from
the
Writing
Associate
program,
I
experienced
more
of
a
mutual
educational
relationship.
I
assisted
students
in
formulating
coherent
and
powerful
arguments,
while
at
the
same
time
their
opinions
made
the
subject
I
had
once
known
very
little
about
(and
I
suppose
still
do
know
very
little
about)
seem
more
familiar
to
me
as
the
semester
progressed.
The
Writing
Associate
program
has
acted
not
only
to
improve
my
own
abilities
as
a
writer,
but
has
also
furthered
my
education
in
other
topics
once
again.
Of
course,
the
Writing
Associate
meetings
were
not
all
fun
and
games.
My
most
difficult
of
meetings
were
mostly
a
result
of
negative
attitudes
towards
the
program,
towards
the
class,
or
towards
writing
in
general.
Because
Lafayette
requires
students
to
take
such
a
diverse
array
of
writing
classes
outside
of
oneOs
major,
there
is
always
the
possibility
for
an
unyielding
student
to
be
troublesome
to
meet
with
to
discuss
his
or
her
writing.
The
interest
is
simply
not
there.
In
these
cases,
and
luckily
they
were
few
and
far
between
during
my
second
year
as
a
Writing
Associate,
I
attempted
to
teach
writing
in
such
a
way
that
appealed
to
that
individual
studentOs
regular
curriculum.
I
was
able
to
adapt
to
students
who
were
more
scientifically
inclined
because
of
my
own
academic
interests.
This,
in
my
opinion,
made
me
unique
among
the
Writing
Associates,
many
of
whom
are
liberal
arts
majors
and
may
not
understand
the
needs
of
engineering
and
science
students.
For
these
students,
I
structured
the
conferences
in
a
somewhat
more
analytical
matter
D
outlining
topics,
diagramming,
etc.
I
turned
a
somewhat
open-ended
subject
into
structured,
step-by-step
program
to
improve
the
paper.
For
other
students,
the
process
remained
open
ended
and
liberal
in
form
D
perhaps
drawing
a
picture
to
express
an
idea.
I
find
it
to
be
ultra
important
to
recognize
the
needs
of
each
student
right
from
the
get-go,
instead
of
wasting
time
trying
to
force
the
student
to
adapt
to
my
own
strategy.
Becoming
a
writing
associate
has
helped
me
communicate
more
effectively
with
people
with
a
range
of
interests
and
learning
styles.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
has
completely
changed
the
way
I
teach
others
about
writing.
Coming
into
the
program
(and
despite
the
descriptions
of
the
program),
I
truly
believed
that
the
main
purpose
of
the
Writing
Associate
program
was
to
correct
papers
for
surface
errors
and
work
on
basic
organization.
It
could
not
have
been
any
more
different!
I
do
not
believe
I
have
had
a
single
conference
related
to
grammar,
and
organization
is
discussed
for
only
a
part
of
the
time,
in
most
cases.
Instead,
my
main
focus
has
been
to
attempt
to
initiate
discussion
about
the
writing,
in
order
to
get
the
writer
to
explore
their
own
arguments,
see
if
they
make
sense
and
are
coherent,
and
last
but
perhaps
most
importantly,
strengthen
them.
Even
if
a
writer
is
completely
uninterested
in
the
subject
of
writing,
it
is
often
the
case
that
the
writer
is
willing
to
discuss
their
own
thoughts
D
simply
avoid
using
the
negative
terms
such
as
NgrammarO
and
Nsentence
structureO
and
NthesisO.
Although
a
writer
may
have
a
poor
thesis
or
no
thesis
whatsoever
coming
into
the
meeting,
a
discussion
of
his
or
her
ideas
will
often
lead
to
the
perfect
thesis
for
the
paper
D
and
the
writer
may
be
completely
unaware
of
that
fact
up
until
the
end
of
the
meeting.
It
is
always
the
most
enjoyable
aspect
of
a
Writing
Associate
meeting
to
see
a
student
who
came
in
completely
lost
at
the
beginning
of
the
meeting
leave
with
a
coherent
outline
of
what
he
or
she
will
write,
all
based
on
informal
discussion
of
the
topic.
My
best
advice
to
a
new
Writing
Associate
has
been
the
same
since
I
completed
my
very
first
semester
as
a
WA.
This
advice
is
simply
to
focus
less
on
the
actual
writing
and
instead
focus
on
the
ideas.
Once
the
ideas
are
out,
zero
in
on
forming
a
coherent
paper
based
upon
them.
Attempting
to
correct
and
organize
a
paper
around
weak
ideas
will
only
be
detrimental
to
the
writer,
as
he
or
she
would
be
wasting
their
time.
I
remember
it
taking
me
a
few
conferences
to
figure
this
out,
but
after
the
initial
learning
period,
conferences
went
a
lot
smoother
and
the
writer
got
a
lot
more
out
of
them.
Besides
helping
my
own
writing
ability
by
reading
all
the
different
writing
styles
of
my
students,
being
a
Writing
Associate
has
improved
my
ability
to
offer
constructive
critiques
of
other
studentOs
work,
as
well
as
my
own.
It
has
become
much
easier
for
me
to
spot
weak
areas
of
a
paper
and
negotiate
a
solution
with
a
student
to
improve
the
writing.
My
mind
is
so
focused
on
arguments,
logical
flow,
coherency
and
thesis
that
I
sometimes
forget
to
check
for
such
simple
things
as
grammar
and
spelling
D
even
on
my
own
work.
It
takes
me
forever
to
write
even
an
essay
consisting
of
only
a
couple
of
pages,
simply
because
I
keep
writing
and
rewriting
paragraphs
D
constantly
improving
them.
Becoming
a
Writing
Associate
has
changed
the
way
I
look
at
a
paper.
I
constantly
ask
myself
D
what
would
I
say
if
another
student
had
shown
this
to
me?
Critiquing
my
own
work
as
I
would
for
any
of
my
students
has
dramatically
improved
the
quality
of
my
own
writing.
So
that
just
about
sums
up
my
career
as
a
Writing
Associate
so
far,
as
well
as
what
I
have
learned
during
the
past
year.
My
current
goal
as
a
writer
is,
simply,
improvement
D
continuous
improvement.
I
feel
that
this
Writing
Associate
position
will
only
help
to
improve
my
writing.
Undoubtedly,
I
will
read
studentsO
works
that
will
easily
surpass
my
own
in
terms
of
organization,
clarity,
and
a
host
of
other
characteristics.
I
am
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
my
peers.
Likewise,
I
will
also
be
able
to
help
my
fellow
Lafayette
students
communicate
through
writing
more
effectively
by
teaching
them
the
skills
I
have
picked
up
throughout
my
own
writing
career.
