An
Imagination
Workout.
Slowly,
I
made
my
way
to
the
front
of
the
classroom.
Weaving
through
the
desks,
I
could
only
think
of
how
much
I
didn't
want
to
be
doing
this.
I
hate
reading
out
loud--especially
my
own
writing.
Sooner
than
I
would
have
liked,
I
was
standing
in
front
of
the
fifth
grade
accelerated
reading
class.
I
started
reading...
Red
Is
Great.
Red
is
a
Christmas
light.
Apples
are
red
and
a
worm's
delight
Red
peppers
and
ripe
strawberries,
A
cardinal
is
red
and
so
are
cherries.
A
rose
is
red,
A
parrot
named
Ted,
A
cold
nose
And
Christmas
bows.
Licorice
and
Swedish
fish
are
red
and
yummy
In
my
tummy.
The
American
Flag,
A
price
tag
and
a
pretzel
bag.
Buy
a
red
poppy
for
a
dime!
As
I
finished,
I
hoped,
rather
demanded,
that
the
class
liked
my
poem.
The
sweet
sound
of
laughter
started
to
fill
the
room.
I
smiled.
I
was
glad
that
someone
liked
my
writing;
I
was
hooked.
I
was
hooked
on
being
creative
with
my
writing.
This
worked
well
for
me,
because
most
of
my
teachers
encouragec
me
to
be
as
imaginative
as
I
could.
They
challenged
me
to
look
at
a
topic
fronr
many
different
angles.
As
the
years
progressed,
I
continued
to
let
my
mind
wonder.
My
stories
filled
with
details.
Smells,
sounds
and
textures
took
root
in
my
writing.
Paragraphs
exploded
into
pages.
Places
were
built
and
characters
born.
Along
with
a
fresh
imagination,
my
writing
became
bold.
I
began
to
test
the
limits
of
my
creativity.
It
was
the
first
week
of
school.
I
was
in
the
eighth
grade,
sitting
in
my
Language
Arts
class.
It
was
near
the
end
of
class
when
my
teacher
passed
out
the
first
assignment.
She
wanted
a
two-page
story
about
what
I
did
over
the
summer
break.
1
wasn't
surprised
to
get
this
assignment;
it
was
a
rather
common
assignment.
I
hadn't
a
clue
what
I
was
going
to
write
about,
so
I
stuffed
the
paper
into
my
book-bag.
I
would
worry
about
it
later.
That
night,
I
pulled
the
wrinkled
paper
from
my
bag
and
re-read
the
assignment.
The
only
thing
that
I
did
over
the
summer
was
go
to
the
shore
with
my
family.
It
was
something
we
did
every
year,
and
wasn't
very
exciting.
So
I
sat
at
my
desk
with
a
black
pen
and
my
Language
Arts,
3-ring,
binder
and
began
to
write.
I
wrote
about
how
my
family
went
on
a
vacation
to
the
shore,
but
I
added
some
extra
details.
My
story
quickly
evolved
into
a
gruesome
seagull
attack
on
myself.
Using
every
sense,
I
described
being
hit
with
seagull
droppings.
After
about
a
page
of
details,
I
concluded
the
adventure
with
a
snappy
moral
of
how
you
should
not
feed
the
seagulls.
The
next
day,
with
a
big
grin,
I
handed
in
my
story.
I
really
don't
know
why
I
wrote
that
story.
I
just
let
my
imagination
run.
When
my
paper
was
returned
to
me,
I
expected
to
have
negative
comments
scribbled
in
red
ink
throughout
my
paper.
Instead,
added
in
the
margins
were
comments
like
"good
description"
and
"nice
use
of
the
senses."
I
was
shocked.
I
had
expected
to
get
shunned,
but
I
was
praised.
My
writing
continued
to
change.
Just
as
I
became
comfortable
with
creative
writing,
I
was
asked
to
write
a
research
paper.
It
was
my
freshman
year
in
high
school.
The
class
was
Humanities
I.
It
was
team
taught
by
a
history
and
English
teacher.
The
assignment
was
to
explain
how
the
three
different
styles
of
Greek
columns
reflected
the
attitudes
of
that
time
period.
I
was
petrified.
Never
had
I
been
asked
to
write
a
research
paper.
I
didn't
know
how
to
write
a
research
paper.
I
was
given
a
handout
on
how
to
cite
sources
and
one
class
period
in
the
library.
From
that
I
wrote
a
confident
paper.
I
made
sure
I
cited
my
references
correctly,
and
that
my
thesis
was
clearly
stated.
Everything
about
this
paper
was
good;
so
I
handed
it
in,
confident
with
my
work.
I
had
written
a
good
research
paper...so
I
thought.
When
the
day
came
to
return
the
papers,
I
was
eager
to
see
my
grade.
My
name
was
called
and
I
scurried
through
the
desks
to
get
my
paper.
When
I
looked
down,
I
was
crushed.
Written
on
the
top
page,
in
big,
red,
capital
letters
was
"You
write
like
you
have
a
bag
over
your
head--C."
I
was
devastated,
even
angry
that
my
teacher
would
say
that
about
my
paper.
This
was
definitely
the
worst
experience
I
have
ever
had
as
a
writer.
I
truly
thought
I
had
a
good
paper.
Apparently
I
was
wrong.
After
that
incident,
I
was
turned
off
to
writing.
I
wrote
only
to
satisfy
my
requirements.
Writing
became
boring.
It
was
merely
a
chore
that
had
to
be
done
to
get
by.
This
went
on
for
a
little
over
a
year.
During
this
time,
my
writing
had
no
personality,
no
character
and
no
imagination.
Then
I
received
my
Hero
assignment.
The
assignment
was
simple,
but
complex.
I
had
to
pick
someone
from
my
life
to
be
my
hero.
It
could
have
been
anyone,
living
or
nonliving,
factual
or
fictional.
I
sat
at
my
desk
and
thought
about
all
the
influences
in
my
life.
I
had
to
pick
someone
who
meant
a
lot
to
me.
The
list
narrowed
to
my
grandfather's
name.
He
was
someone
I
watched
in
admiration
until
his
death
the
previous
summer.
I
committed
myself
to
writing
a
paper
about
him.
As
I
gathered
my
thoughts,
I
knew
that
this
had
to
be
an
excellent
paper.
I
thought
of
it
as
a
tribute
to
my
personal
hero.
I
made
an
outline
and
began
to
write.
The
words
flowed
smoother
than
ever.
I
was
holding
a
conversation
with
the
reader.
My
writing
was
completely
natural.
It
was
much
more
relaxed,
and
it
showed.
The
paper
was
fabulous.
When
it
was
returned
to
me,
it
was
filled
with
great
comments.
After
that
paper,
I
was
excited
about
writing.
I
started
writing
with
passion.
Simple
essays
became
personalized.
I
was
developing
style.
My
teacher
came
to
me
and
said
that
she
enjoyed
reading
my
papers.
She
even
enjoyed
essays
and
short
answer
questions
that
I
wrote
on
tests.
Before,
I
was
excited
about
writing.
After
her
comments,
I
looked
forward
to
writing.
I
was
fascinated
with
being
able
to
express
my
thoughts
and
ideas
on
paper.
Two
more
years
rolled
by
and
I
was
applying
to
colleges.
When
I
stumbled
across
my
Lafayette
application,
I
was
relieved.
Finally,
I
could
write
an
essay
about
whatever
I
wanted
to.
This
came
as
a
treat
to
me
since
all
my
other
applications
required
me
to
write
about
the
specified
topic.
Although
I
had
the
option
to
write
about
a
given
topic,
I
decided
to
get
creative
for
Lafayette.
Now
the
question
was
what
to
write
about.
I
needed
to
pick
a
topic
that
was
appropriate
for
a
college,
but
would
stick
out
in
the
mind
of
the
reader.
My
discussion
had
to
show
that
I
had
personality
and
was
not
afraid
to
have
an
opinion.
I
decided
to
write
about
personal
injury
lawyers.
Although
my
writing
had
a
definite
tone,
it
was
fair.
I
provided
a
solution
to
lawsuit
abuse
and
discussed
how
this
solution
would
impact
our
lives.
By
giving
a
solution,
I
tried
to
show
that
I
wasn't
just
complaining
but
offering
my
services.
I
worked
very
hard
on
that
one
page
document.
I
rearranged
all
the
words
until
I
thought
it
had
the
most
impact.
I
drafted
and
drafted.
It
was
passed
to
my
teachers
and
other
friends
for
their
opinion.
I
kept
an
open
mind
for
suggestion.
After
about
a
week
of
scrubbing
and
polishing,
I
sent
it
off
to
Lafayette.
I
hope
the
people
who
read
it
enjoyed
it.
The
next
thing
I
knew,
I
was
off
to
college.
As
time
flew
by,
I
completed
my
FYS.
I
learned
many
new
rules
of
grammar
and
how
to
manipulate
those
rules
for
effect.
During
the
first
semester,
my
writing
improved
by
leaps
and
bounds.
I
studied
the
structure
of
sentences
and
paragraphs.
Sentence
and
paragraph
structure
captured
my
attention.
Everywhere
I
turned
I
was
analyzing
the
author's
style.
How
many
different
ways
can
I
re-arrange
this
sentence
and
what
kind
of
effect
does
such
a
change
bring?
Second
semester
crept
in
and
I
was
now
in
my
FYW.
I
was
asked
to
write
a
paper
on
a
place
that
represents
who
I
am.
Again,
I
sat
down
at
my
desk,
only
this
time
it
was
one
of
the
college's
desks.
I
thought
about
all
the
places
I
have
been,
and
decided
to
write
a
story
about
my
hunting
cabin.
It
was
flooded
with
rich
details.
For
the
first
time,
I
incorporated
dialogue
into
my
paper.
A
lot
of
hard
work
went
into
this
paper.
I
was
proud.
Obviously
my
professor
thought
it
was
good,
because
the
final
draft
was
packed
full
of
good
comments.
I
had
written
a
good,
solid
paper.
Decent
writing,
as
with
everything,
comes
with
a
lot
of
work.
When
I
finally
wrote
a
good
paper,
I
was
ecstatic.
All
of
my
hard
work
had
paid
off.
But
the
thing
that
most
excited
me
most
was
the
ability
to
entertain
the
reader.
The
reader
could
understand
my
thinking,
my
hopes
and
my
style.
I
realize
that
all
the
previous
papers
were
merely
practice
for
better
writing.
I
am
anxious
to
see
what
lies
ahead.
A
writer's
problem
does
not
change.
He
himself
changes
and
the
world
he
lives
in
changes
but
his
problem
remains
the
same.
It
is
always
how
to
write
truly
and
having
found
what
is
true,
to
project
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
becomes
a
part
of
the
experience
of
the
person
who
reads
it.
--Ernest
Hemingway
