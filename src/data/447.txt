Writing
as
a
WA
Fall
2004
This
past
year
has
been
one
of
extremes
in
terms
of
my
writing.
During
the
fall
semester,
I
was
taking
two
English
writing
courses
and
two
other
courses
that
involved
writing,
as
well
as
working
as
a
Writing
Associate.
I
was
always
involved
either
in
something
I
was
writing
for
a
class
or
in
reading
my
studentsO
papers.
But
come
spring
semester,
I
flew
off
to
Paris,
where
lengthy
writing
became
a
rare
activity.
Though
my
semester
at
Lafayette
was
obviously
more
influential
in
developing
myself
as
a
writer
and
a
trained
reader,
my
time
in
France
still
has
an
important
place
in
my
history
as
a
writer.
My
semester
as
a
writing
associate
was
a
wonderful
experience.
My
WA
class
varied
greatly
in
its
skill
level.
A
few
students
wrote
consistently
strong
papers,
and
others
always
needed
some
rethinking,
but
I
did
see
improvement
in
all
of
the
students
over
the
course
of
the
semester.
The
set-up
of
the
class
assignments
was
interesting
to
me.
The
professor
assigned
topics
first
as
group
research
assignments;
three
or
four
students
were
given
the
same
topic
and
they
researched
it
and
presented
their
research
as
a
group.
They
then
wrote
papers
on
that
topic
individually.
Though
it
was
sometimes
boring
for
me
as
a
WA
to
read
the
same
information
four
times,
it
was
also
interesting
to
see
four
different
peopleOs
take
on
the
same
topic.
Because
their
research
was
the
same,
it
was
easy
to
make
comparisons
between
the
students
within
a
group.
I
was
able
to
more
fully
understand
each
topic,
and
could
then
see
more
clearly
where
a
student
needed
elaboration
or
clarification.
At
the
same
time,
however,
I
was
surprised
when
I
realized
that
I
was
not
actually
very
impressed
with
the
topics
provided
for
the
students.
Though
I
liked
the
combination
of
group
and
individual
work,
I
thought
that
the
topics
were
too
restrictive
and
did
not
allow
room
for
the
students
to
develop
interesting
theses
on
their
own.
They
were
merely
filling
in
the
blanks.
It
was
actually
only
once
that
I
saw
a
student
make
a
more
interesting
development
in
his
paper
and
I
almost
didnOt
understand
what
he
was
doing!
The
paper
was
very
confusing
and
hard
to
follow.
During
his
conference
I
asked
him
to
verbally
explain
his
paper,
and
I
realized
that
his
take
on
the
topic
was
very
insightful
and
had
put
a
new
twist
on
the
material.
He
knew
what
he
wanted
to
say
and
could
explain
it
to
me
in
words,
but
had
not
clearly
written
it.
We
worked
together
on
his
sentence
structure
and
his
organization,
so
that
he
could
more
clearly
transfer
the
thoughts
in
his
head
onto
paper.
This
is
one
of
the
WA
conferences
of
which
I
am
most
proud,
because
I
think
that
as
a
result,
the
student
got
a
better
grasp
on
the
writing
process
and
learned
what
he
needed
to
do
to
make
himself
a
successful
writer.
Another
memorable
conference
occurred
while
I
was
working
at
drop-in
hours.
I
worked
with
an
international
student
who
was
having
a
lot
of
trouble
writing
in
English.
WeOd
discussed
the
difficulties
of
English
as
a
second
language
frequently
during
staff
meetings
because
one
of
the
other
Writing
Associates
had
many
international
students
in
his
class,
but
that
conference
was
my
first
experience
with
it.
It
was
more
challenging
than
any
of
the
conferences
with
my
American
students.
I
found
myself
explaining
grammatical
points
that
a
native
English
speaker
knows
without
thinking,
and
struggling
to
describe
the
minute
differences
between
various
expressions
and
words
that
even
I
didnOt
fully
understand,
but
knew
instinctively
to
be
true.
It
was
a
long,
long
conference,
and
it
really
impressed
upon
me
how
difficult
it
is
to
understand
and
use
all
of
the
intricacies
of
a
second
language.
Often
the
most
challenging
aspect
of
working
with
students
as
a
writing
associate
was
pinpointing
issues.
Many
times
a
paper
didnOt
feel
right,
although
errors
were
not
immediately
obvious.
It
required
careful
reading
and
discussion
with
the
student
to
figure
out
the
slight
adjustments
needed
to
change
an
awkward
paper
into
one
that
read
more
easily.
I
read
many
papers
which
I
knew
had
problems,
but
found
it
difficult
to
express
just
what
those
problems
were
and
how
to
fix
them.
As
I
read
more
papers
and
held
more
conferences,
however,
I
got
better
at
defining
the
problems
that
I
sensed
in
papers,
and
could
give
the
students
concrete
advice
for
writing
more
clearly.
There
was
one
student
whose
papers
were
always
very
well
written
and
thorough,
and
absent
of
any
obvious
mistakes.
Still,
her
papers
did
not
read
well.
It
took
awhile
before
I
realized
that
every
sentence
she
wrote
was
essentially
a
run-on;
she
had
no
variation
of
sentence
structure.
Suddenly
I
was
able
to
clarify
to
her
the
issues
I
read
in
her
writing
and
could
help
her
edit
her
paper
by
breaking
up
some
of
her
sentences.
My
own
writing
and
my
work
as
a
writing
associate
inevitably
affected
each
other
during
the
semester.
My
writing
style
tends
to
be
pretty
formal;
one
of
my
professors
has
told
me
to
work
on
making
it
more
informal.
While
working
on
WA
papers,
I
noticed
that
research
papers
that
are
written
less
formally
often
become
too
conversational
and
poorly
writtenNbut
perhaps
my
own
writing
tendencies
lead
me
to
be
overly
sensitive
to
that
in
othersO
papers.
Being
a
writing
associate
had
a
positive
influence
on
my
own
writing.
As
a
WA,
I
used
all
of
the
NrightO
techniquesNdeveloping
a
thesis,
creating
an
outline,
organizing
evidenceNto
work
with
the
students
on
their
papers.
When
working
on
my
own
papers,
I
began,
more
frequently,
to
formulate
an
outline
and
to
spend
more
time
in
the
planning
stages,
rather
than
jumping
right
into
the
writing
as
I
previously
tended
to
do,
especially
when
pressed
for
time.
Writing
first,
and
organizing
second,
as
many
of
my
WA
students
do,
is
much
more
difficult.
Seeing
some
of
their
difficulties
reminded
me
of
how
much
easier
it
is,
in
the
long
run,
to
take
the
time
to
organize
before
starting
to
compose.
Along
the
same
lines,
working
as
a
Writing
Associate
caused
me
to
think
more
about
the
value
of
a
rough
draft.
I
was
surprised
by
how
incomplete
many
of
the
drafts
I
received
were.
It
was
frustrating
to
me
as
a
WA
to
read
papers
that
had
been
written
without
much
thought
or
which
were
incomplete.
Plus,
it
was
not
as
useful
for
the
students
to
meet
with
me
as
it
could
have
been
had
they
been
more
prepared.
So
I
know
that
even
when
I
am
pressed
for
time,
writing
a
draft
as
though
it
is
the
final
paper
is
still
important.
Being
a
WA
also
reinforced
the
importance
of
actually
reading
what
you
write.
I
read
so
many
sentences
that
made
little
sense
or
were
poorly
worded,
problems
that
certainly
could
have
been
fixed
by
the
students
if
they
had
re-read
their
work.
My
advice
to
them
was
always
the
same:
read
the
paper
out
loud,
no
matter
how
much
it
annoys
your
roommate.
Reading
out
loud
catches
the
mistakes
that
a
writer
doesnOt
make
when
speaking,
such
as
misplaced
words
or
choppy
sentences.
ItOs
something
that
has
always
been
important
to
me,
and
even
more
so
now.
As
a
writing
associate,
it
was
frustrating
for
me
to
constantly
read
these
smaller,
easily
fixable
problems.
My
fall
semester
at
Lafayette
ended
well
and
I
left
for
France,
to
study
in
Paris
for
the
spring
semester.
I
did
much
less
classroom
writing
this
spring
than
in
previous
semesters.
I
did
not
take
any
classes
that
regularly
required
papers,
and
when
I
was
given
a
writing
assignment,
it
was
in
French,
of
course!
When
I
write
in
French,
the
process
is
fairly
different
from
my
English
writing
process.
I
am
constantly
referring
to
a
dictionary
or
grammar
book,
preferring
to
edit
as
I
write,
rather
than
getting
all
of
my
ideas
onto
paper
and
then
refining
them.
Because
I
am
so
much
less
certain
of
the
language
I
am
using,
it
is
a
much
slower
process.
It
is
frustrating
in
some
ways,
because
I
can
write
much
more
quickly
in
English,
but
it
also
means
that
everything
I
say
is
more
precise.
I
am
also
more
innovativeNif
I
am
unsure
about
the
French
translation
of
a
certain
phrase,
I
will
reword
it
in
French
in
a
way
I
am
sure
is
correct!
I
am
forced
to
put
a
lot
of
thought
into
every
sentence,
making
sure
that
it
is
grammatically
correct
in
French,
in
addition
to
clearly
expressing
the
idea
that
I
formulated
in
English.
Although
I
did
less
assigned
writing
while
in
Paris,
I
spent
more
time
writing
for
myself,
jotting
my
thoughts
and
experiences
in
my
journal.
IOve
always
been
a
sporadic
journal
writer,
and
I
enjoyed
writing
more
in
it
this
past
semester.
Partly
because
I
really
wanted
to
capture
my
experiences
in
France
as
they
happened,
and
partly
because
I
had
more
free
time
before
and
after
classes
to
devote
to
the
things
that
get
tossed
aside
at
Lafayette,
reading
and
writing
for
fun,
I
was
finally
consistent
about
writing
in
a
journal.
It
was
a
nice
break
to
write
only
for
myself,
without
worrying
about
grammar
or
following
an
outline.
Being
in
France
led
to
one
unusual
group-oriented
writing
experience.
The
program
center
in
Paris
had
a
small
computer
lab,
and
the
other
students
and
INinternet
addicts,
even
in
FranceNalways
spent
time
there
after
classes,
checking
our
email
and
catching
up
on
news
from
home.
It
was
a
friendly,
social
atmosphere,
and
so
whenever
someone
got
stuck
while
writing
an
email
to
a
professor
or
a
boss
back
home,
others
in
the
group
would
help
them
to
find
the
right
word
or
sentence.
It
was
interesting
to
see
how
one
person
can
struggle
to
write
something
appropriate,
but
as
soon
as
a
friend
looks
at
it,
she
knows
just
what
to
say.
I
know
that
I
will
miss
those
impromptu
group-writing
sessions
the
next
time
I
donOt
know
what
to
say
in
an
email!
Those
experiences
definitely
proved
how
valuable
it
is
to
have
a
second
opinion
in
writing
-
someone
to
read
and
offer
up
suggestions
-
whether
it
is
for
an
important
email
or
a
lengthy
research
paper.
With
the
exception
of
the
lab
at
the
school,
I
didnOt
have
a
computer
in
France.
In
my
history
as
a
writer
from
last
year,
I
discussed
how
influential
the
computer
was
in
my
writing
process.
In
France,
that
was
hardly
an
option,
because
time
to
spend
writing
on
a
computer
was
fairly
limited.
When
I
was
assigned
an
essay,
I
wrote
it
out
entirely
by
hand,
a
fairly
different
experience
from
writing
on
a
computer,
because
the
words
I
edited
out
were
still
visible
on
the
draft.
Writing
by
hand
in
France
was
actually
a
continuation
of
a
movement
away
from
the
computer
that
started
when
I
became
a
WA.
The
process
of
reviewing
studentsO
papers
and
holding
conferences
as
a
WA
is
very
much
based
on
editing
by
hand.
I
jot
notes
on
the
studentsO
papers
when
I
read
them
and
have
the
students
rewrite
thesis
sentences
and
outlines
on
their
papers
during
conferences.
This
editing
process
is
very
visual;
any
thoughts
and
changes
are
written
down
on
the
draft
to
be
reviewed
later,
and
therefore
both
the
old
and
the
new
remain
as
a
part
of
the
writing
process.
Editing
with
a
computer
means
that
changes
made
are
immediately
in
place;
anything
deleted
is
permanently
gone.
I
much
prefer
to
see
the
changes,
to
be
able
to
see
what
IOve
written
and
what
IOve
added,
so
that
I
have
all
of
my
thoughts
written
on
the
draft
when
I
correct
the
final
version.
IOve
often
tended
to
just
edit
on
the
computer,
because
it
is
faster
and
easier.
Being
a
writing
associate,
though,
has
reminded
me
of
my
preference
for
editing
by
hand
on
paper,
and
being
in
France
only
reinforced
that,
since
I
did
all
of
my
writing
by
hand.
IOm
looking
forward
to
getting
back
to
Lafayette
this
fall.
It
will
be
interesting
to
compare
my
new
WA
class
with
the
class
I
had
last
year.
I
think
that
I
will
be
able
to
do
a
better
job,
using
what
I
learned
from
being
a
WA,
both
when
working
with
my
class
and
when
writing
my
own
assignments.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
is
a
learning
process
that
will
continue
with
every
paper
I
read
or
write.
