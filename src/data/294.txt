MY
WRITING
HISTORY
Dotson,
New
Writing
Associate
Fall
Semester
2001
Writing
is
an
essential
tool
for
communication
in
every
facet
of
life.
Continually
learning
and
working
to
develop
ones
writing
skills
is
very
important
to
a
successful
life,
not
only
throughout
school,
but
also
after
graduation
in
the
"Real
World".
I
have
been
developing
my
writing
my
entire
life.
Although
I've
never
thought
of
myself
as
a
very
good
writer
(certainly
not
Pulitzer
Prize
winning
by
any
means),
I
feel
that
I
have
a
fairly
confident
grasp
on
how
to
get
my
point
across.
I'm
sure
there
are
many
areas
where
I
could
use
some
help,
and
I
hope
to
continue
my
development
as
a
writer
in
the
years
to
come,
not
stopping
once
I
receive
my
diploma
next
spring.
I'm
beginning
to
learn
that
writing
will
be
an
integral
part
of
my
life,
even
after
graduation.
I
can
recall
many
times
when
I
was
little,
perhaps
third
or
fourth
grade,
that
my
friends
and
I
just
decided
to
write
stories
for
fun.
My
little
sister
and
I
used
to
draw
elaborate
pictures
of
alien
creatures
with
five
eyes
and
wheels
for
feet,
who
lived
on
strange
planets
with
purple
skies
and
blue
grass.
Since
she
was
too
young
to
write,
it
was
then
my
responsibility
to
write
short
biographies
for
each
of
the
creatures
we
had
created
and
read
them
to
her.
I'd
write
about
where
they
lived
and
what
they
ate
(most
of
them
ate
people
at
that
point).
And
sometimes
I'd
include
a
few
sentences
about
where
they
liked
to
go
on
vacation
or
how
many
kids
they
had.
These
little
stories
are
still
amusing
to
read
when
I
find
them
around
the
house.
Another
instance
that
I
remember
quite
vividly
occurred
in
fifth
grade.
My
best
friend
Matt
and
I
decided
to
write
a
story
in
which
all
the
characters
were
modeled
after
our
friends.
I
was
quite
the
tomboy
at
that
age,
so
most
of
my
writings
reflected
the
ideas
of
a
10-year-old
boy.
The
story
that
Matt
and
I
ended
up
writing
was
basically
a
chainsaw
massacre
love
story.
A
strange
man
shows
up
uninvited
at
a
party
on
Halloween
and
whenever
anyone
approaches
him
to
find
out
who
he
is,
they
disappear
and
end
up
with
their
heads
chopped
off
hanging
in
a
shack
somewhere.
He
kills
Matt's
girlfriend,
so
we
seek
revenge.
We
finally
track
him
down
and
kill
him,
then
we
all
go
out
for
ice
cream
and
live
happily
ever
after.
It
sounds
like
a
typical
story
that
a
couple
of
fifth
graders
would
write
-
not
exactly
a
literary
masterpiece,
but
still
a
huge
accomplishment
for
a
10-year-old.
In
fact,
I
still
have
that
story
around
somewhere.
Throughout
the
next
few
years,
I
unknowingly
developed
my
writing
into
something
a
bit
more
tame
and
worthy
enough
to
actually
turn
in
for
homework.
My
writings
in
junior
high
and
early
high
school
were
usually
very
short
academic
writings,
such
as
book
reports
and
essays
to
show
that
you
knew
how
to
use
the
reference
section
at
the
library.
I
didn't
realize
it
at
the
time,
but
even
though
these
essays
and
book
reports
didn't
seem
to
be
teaching
me
anything,
I
was
really
learning
a
great
deal
about
writing.
Every
time
a
writing
assignment
was
given,
I
dreaded
it.
The
teachers
would
always
try
to
scare
us
into
doing
the
work
because
we
needed
the
practice.
"Just
wait
until
you
get
to
college
and
you
have
a
week
to
write
a
30
page
term
paper
on
the
history
of
chalk!"
If
we
didn't
learn
it
now,
we'd
never
get
into
college
and
we'd
never
get
a
job,
and
we'd
be
living
under
a
bridge
down
the
road
for
the
rest
of
our
lives.
I
preferred
math
and
science,
and
the
thought
of
having
to
write
even
a
one
page
essay
seemed
like
a
waste
of
my
time.
But
I
always
got
through
it,
and
I
got
fairly
good
grades
on
all
my
assignments.
I
had
come
a
long
way
from
the
green-haired
aliens
and
chainsaw
mutilations
of
grade
school.
However,
my
writing
still
had
a
long
way
to
go
before
I
could
even
think
about
tackling
the
30
pages
about
chalk.
Finally,
my
junior
year
in
high
school,
it
all
started
to
culminate
and
once
again,
I
was
dreading
the
thought
of
it.
Everyone
knows
that
eleventh
grade
is
when
you
learn
to
write
a
research
paper.
What!?
This
means
that
your
paper
has
to
be
more
than
a
page,
and
you
have
to
use
more
than
one
encyclopedia
to
get
the
information.
You
might
even
have
to
read
other
books
that
aren
't
labeled
A-Z!!
Whoa.
I'll
never
be
able
to
do
that,
I
thought.
I'd
been
doing
so
well
and
now
I
was
gonna
fail
junior
English
because
of
this
unreasonable
12-page
paper
with
multiple
sources.
Luckily,
the
teacher
took
us
through
it
step
by
step
(I
guess
that's
what
teaching
is
supposed
to
be,
right?).
First,
you
get
assigned
a
general
topic
and
must
narrow
it
down.
Thank
goodness
my
topic
was
related
to
science,
so
at
least
I
was
interested
in
it
-
it
was
AIDS,
and
I
narrowed
it
down
to
the
treatment
of
AIDS
(drug
therapies,
etc).
At
least
it
wasn't
the
history
of
chalk.
The
next
step
was
to
search
the
card
catalog
and
the
computer
for
all
the
reference
sources
you
can
find
on
your
topic
and
get
the
librarian
to
help
you
find
them
all.
Then
you
read
(or
skim)
them
all
to
find
relevant
information,
and
write
each
individual
note
on
a
note-card
with
the
source
on
the
back
so
that
you
can
site
it
correctly
when
you
are
done.
Once
you
have
all
the
notes
you
think
are
needed
for
this
monstrous
work,
they
are
put
in
an
appropriate
order,
and
form
an
outline.
From
the
outline,
you
basically
just
fill
in
the
blanks
to
create
the
rough
draft,
have
several
people
edit
it
for
you,
turn
it
in,
and
pray
that
the
teacher
likes
you.
At
least,
that's
how
I
wrote
my
first
research
paper,
and
it
turned
out
that
it
was
not
really
as
bad
as
I
thought
it
would
be.
That
assignment
showed
me
that
even
projects
that
appear
severely
daunting
can
be
handled
when
broken
down
into
smaller
parts.
That
thought
has
lowered
my
stress
level
greatly
(although
not
completely)
over
the
past
three
years
at
Lafayette.
My
senior
year
in
high
school,
I
decided
to
take
AP
English,
which
required
writing
something
almost
everyday.
These
were
mostly
short
writings
-
essays,
free
writing
exercises,
and
literary
critiques.
By
the
end
of
the
year,
I
had
no
problem
writing
a
page
or
two
a
night
for
assignments.
Short
essays
no
longer
caused
me
stress
and
I
was
finally
comfortable
and
confident
in
my
writing
(to
a
certain
degree).
Also,
taking
this
class
allowed
me
to
place
out
of
English
110/College
Writing
during
the
second
semester
of
my
freshman
year,
which
seemed
to
lift
a
huge
weight
from
my
shoulders.
I
could
concentrate
on
my
math
and
science
classes
and
not
have
to
worry
about
huge
writing
assignments
and
term
papers.
Or
so
I
thought.
My
first
semester
at
Lafayette,
I
took
a
course
called
Chemistry
and
Art
as
my
First
Year
Seminar.
This
course
was
based
around
the
chemical
processes
taking
place
in
pieces
of
artwork
from
various
time
periods.
We
spoke
about
the
Sistine
Chapel
and
how
it
was
deteriorating
due
to
the
egg-based
shelac
that
had
ironically
been
used
to
preserve
it
centuries
again.
We
also
learned
about
the
science
of
light
and
color,
and
the
chemical
composition
of
the
first
paints.
Once
again
my
writing
would
be
linked
to
the
field
of
science,
which
made
it
easier
for
me
to
motivate
myself
to
work
through
the
papers
that
were
assigned
throughout
the
semester.
I
wrote
on
topics
such
as
the
relationship
between
science
and
art,
and
the
progression
of
artists'
materials
and
methods
since
the
Renaissance.
Even
though
I
had
learned
how
to
tackle
large
assignments,
I
was
still
nervous
when
it
came
to
writing
papers
longer
than
a
few
pages.
Luckily,
the
longest
assignment
that
we
were
given
that
first
semester
was
about
12
pages,
as
opposed
to
the
20-
and
30-page
papers
that
some
of
my
friends
were
forced
to
write.
Since
this
was
my
first
actual
college
writing
class,
I
was
quite
a
bit
apprehensive
at
the
beginning
of
the
semester.
The
words
of
my
high
school
English
teachers
haunted
me,
and
I
felt
that,
even
though
I
had
done
all
of
my
assignments
in
high
school
and
worked
hard
to
develop
my
writing,
I
wasn't
adequately
prepared
for
this
(and
I
still
knew
nothing
about
the
history
of
chalk).
However,
the
professor
was
very
nice
and
always
available
for
extra
help
(I
happened
to
have
her
for
another
class
that
semester
as
well).
So
I
made
the
most
of
the
skills
I
possessed
and
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
the
library
that
semester
doing
research
for
various
assignments.
My
FYS
not
only
helped
me
to
continue
to
develop
my
writing
on
the
college
level,
but
it
also
gave
me
a
great
appreciation
for
and
interest
in
Renaissance
art,
which
I
will
always
carry
with
me.
My
next
writing
class
was
my
VAST
during
sophomore
year.
Like
all
engineering
majors,
I
had
no
choice
in
which
VAST
class
to
take.
I
had
to
take
Engineering
Professionalism
and
Ethics.
We
talked
about
various
engineering
disasters
throughout
history
and
how
they
were
caused
by
people
who
were
not
following
the
engineers'
Code
of
Ethics
and
made
an
unwise
decision
in
design
or
construction
(usually
because
it
was
easier,
faster,
or
cheaper).
We
also
covered
topics
such
as
engineering
economics
(cost-benefit
analysis)
and
various
ethical
theories
proposed
by
philosophers
such
as
Kant.
We
had
two
writing
assignments
for
this
class.
The
first
was
a
5-page
paper
on
what
"professionalism"
means
to
you.
It
was
an
interesting
topic,
and
I
thought
long
and
hard
about
what
I
was
going
to
write
and
managed
to
come
up
with
five
pages
worth
of
material.
The
second
paper
was
to
be
my
largest
writing
accomplishment
so
far
-
a
20-page
paper
on
an
engineering/ethical
topic
of
my
choosing
that
was
worth
a
large
portion
of
my
final
grade
in
the
class.
I
did
some
research
and
tried
to
come
up
with
a
fun
topic
that
would
hold
my
interest
long
enough
to
write
20
pages
about
it.
I
also
wanted
to
choose
a
topic
that
had
a
large
amount
of
material
available,
so
it
would
not
be
too
difficult
to
find
enough
information.
Finally,
I
chose
to
write
my
paper
on
the
Love
Canal
disaster
in
New
York,
and
I
followed
the
same
procedure
that
I
had
taken
three
years
earlier
to
write
my
AIDS
research
paper.
I
went
through
all
of
my
sources
and
wrote
everything
on
note-cards,
formed
an
outline,
and
finally
completed
the
rough
draft.
I
remember
writing
this
paper
vividly
because
after
the
first
five
pages
or
so,
my
computer
froze
and
got
some
kind
of
virus
and
couldn't
retrieve
what
I
had
written.
I
was
so
angry.
I
complained
to
my
friends
for
a
while,
but
eventually
I
sat
down
to
try
and
reconstruct
what
I
had
lost.
Of
course,
I
think
it
was
better
the
first
time,
and
I
was
never
quite
satisfied
with
the
final
draft.
But
at
last
I
had
written
an
entire
20-page
paper!
And
actually,
I
think
it
was
longer
than
20
pages
and
I
needed
to
cut
it
back.
I
met
with
my
WA,
and
he
praised
me
for
my
excellent
work.
He
gave
me
a
few
ideas
about
what
sections
I
could
get
away
with
taking
out
to
meet
the
20-page
limit,
corrected
some
of
my
typographical
errors,
and
showed
me
a
few
sections
that
might
be
reworded
to
better
meet
the
professor's
expectations
in
grading.
I
made
the
few
minor
corrections
and
turned
in
my
paper.
I
can't
remember
exactly
what
grade
I
got
on
that
paper,
but
I
got
an
A
in
the
class,
so
it
couldn't
have
been
very
bad
at
all.
I
was
very
proud
of
that
paper.
Once
again
I
learned
something
by
doing
this
assignment,
even
though
it
is
probably
an
obvious
conclusion.
This
time
I
learned
that
it
is
much
easier
to
write
a
paper
if
the
topic
is
something
that
interests
you.
It
drives
you
to
continue
your
research
and
get
the
most
precise
facts
available,
and
it
makes
you
more
likely
to
work
on
the
assignment
early
as
opposed
to
putting
it
off
until
the
last
minute,
which
always
makes
for
a
better
paper
anyway.
This
brings
me
to
my
current
writings
of
the
past
year
-
lab
reports.
Chemical
engineering
lab
reports
are
a
completely
different
style
of
writing
than
anything
I
had
done
previously.
Some
of
my
lab
reports,
however,
have
been
longer
than
any
of
the
other
writings
that
I
have
ever
done
-
some
as
long
as
25
or
30
pages.
It
took
some
time
to
learn
exactly
what
was
expected
in
these
highly
technical
(and
lengthy)
writings.
There
are
various
required
sections,
such
as
the
introduction,
procedure,
analysis,
and
conclusion,
as
well
as
safety
precautions,
and
recommendations
for
further
experimentation
or
improvement.
Each
of
these
sections
needed
to
contain
specific
information
and
be
formatted
in
a
certain
way.
Many
graphs,
figures,
tables,
and
equations
are
also
included,
and
these
must
also
be
put
in
the
correct
format.
It
was
quite
a
task
to
tackle,
and
I
knew
it
would
cause
many
headaches
along
the
way.
Thankfully,
this
was
considered
a
writing
class
and
we
were
provided
with
a
WA,
who
was
a
member
of
the
senior
class
of
Chemical
engineers.
Since
he
had
taken
this
class
the
previous
year
and
had
been
working
with
the
professors
in
our
department
for
over
two
years,
he
knew
what
the
professors
looked
for,
and
he
knew
what
this
kind
of
technical
writing
should
look
like.
My
WA
was
a
great
help
that
semester,
and
I
feel
that
I
have
greatly
expanded
my
writing
capabilities
in
the
field
of
technical
writing
over
the
past
year.
Lastly,
I
want
to
touch
briefly
on
what
I'm
working
on
right
now.
I
am
interning
at
Merck
&
Co.
for
the
summer
in
the
Sterile
Manufacturing
department.
Surprisingly,
(or
maybe
not)
my
job
requires
a
great
deal
of
writing.
So
far,
I
have
written
two
equipment
validation
protocols,
two
document
change
requests,
and
plenty
of
emails,
memos,
and
other
documents.
As
you
can
imagine,
everything
that
I
write
here
is
very
technical,
sometimes
even
more
so
than
the
lab
reports
for
school.
I
never
imagined
how
much
writing
was
involved
in
engineering,
but
now
I
know
that
in
manufacturing
everything
must
be
documented.
It
must
be
done
in
a
certain
way,
with
very
specific
information,
and
of
course
in
a
timely
fashion.
This
internship
has
been
a
huge
help
in
bolstering
my
communication
skills,
both
written
and
verbal,
and
I
hope
I
can
use
some
of
my
new
knowledge
when
I
return
to
school
next
month.
Over
the
past
20
years
of
my
life,
my
writing
has
developed
from
silly
stories
of
aliens,
to
in-depth
technical
lab
reports
for
my
junior
level
chemical
engineering
courses.
I
have
come
to
see
writing
as
a
necessary
means
of
communication
and
I
am
no
longer
intimidated
by
large
assignments.
I've
learned
that
if
you
just
sit
down
and
do
it
instead
of
complaining
about
the
assignment,
it's
not
that
bad,
and
pretty
soon
you're
done.
A
few
years
ago,
if
I
had
received
this
assignment
to
write
an
entire
seven
pages
about
my
writing
experiences
(and
over
my
summer
vacation,
no
less),
I
would
have
been
severely
stressed
out,
and
it
probably
would
have
taken
me
weeks
to
complete.
But
now,
the
assignment
doesn't
seem
too
unreasonable
(even
though
it
is
over
summer
vacation!),
and
I
was
able
to
chum
out
these
seven
pages
in
just
a
few
hours
of
free
time
at
work
during
my
summer
internship.
I
look
forward
to
applying
my
newly
discovered
skills
as
a
Writing
Associate
this
coming
semester,
and
I
hope
I
can
help
the
new
sophomore
class
of
chemical
engineers
as
much
as
my
WA
helped
me
last
year.
