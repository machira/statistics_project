A
Year
of
Writing
as
a
WA
By
For
a
lot
of
people,
writing
can
be
painful.
This
is
something
new
Writing
Associates
(WAs)
will
learn
and
identify
with
quickly.
Who
hasnOt
tried
for
hours
trying
to
complete
a
writing
assignment
staring
at
a
blank
word
document
on
the
computer
screen?
ItOs
happened
to
you
and
itOs
happened
to
me
and
we
can
both
say
one
thing:
it
is
not
an
enjoyable
experience.
However,
setting
these
incidents
aside,
I
have
always
considered
writing
to
come
to
me
naturally.
Although
I
have
spent
countless
hours
throughout
my
academic
career
staring
at
the
screen,
trying
to
decide
what
to
write
and
how
to
write
it,
for
the
most
part
this
is
usually
not
the
case.
This
explains
why
in
the
past
I
have
described
writing
as
my
best
subject,
as
I
mentioned
in
my
literacy
narrative
I
wrote
last
year.
However,
it
was
not
until
I
became
a
Writing
Associate
(WA)
last
year
that
I
realized
why
I
consider
writing
one
of
my
academic
strengths.
Before
becoming
a
WA
I
already
had
a
clear
understanding
that
writing
is
a
process
not
a
product
and
there
are
series
of
steps
one
must
go
through
to
create
a
piece
of
writing.
For
me,
these
steps
have
included
prewriting
and
drafting/revising.
I
have
also
heavily
relied
on
conversations
about
my
writing
with
teachers,
professors,
and
peers
throughout
the
process.
Combined,
all
of
these
techniques
I
used
to
write
made
the
process
a
lot
less
painful,
which
is
why
I
suppose
I
have
described
writing
as
coming
to
me
naturally
and
why
I
consider
it
one
of
my
strengths.
Working
at
a
WA
has
not
only
confirmed
my
belief
in
these
techniques
(They
really
do
work
to
make
writing
less
agonizing!)
but
I
have
continued
to
use
them
in
the
past
year
myself
as
well
as
with
my
peers
to
make
writing
more
enjoyable.
Before
I
became
a
WA,
I
did
not
realize
how
effective
some
of
these
steps
I
used
to
write
were,
especially
prewriting.
During
my
time
as
a
writer
I
had
often
used
prewriting,
or
outlining
and
note
taking,
before
I
began
an
assignment.
In
my
literacy
narrative
from
last
year
I
describe
going
to
my
teachers
in
middle
school
and
high
school
to
work
on
prewriting.
I
write,
NI
would
meet
with
[my
teachers]
either
before
I
wrote
something
to
brainstorm
and
make
sure
I
had
a
firm
understanding
of
the
assignment.O
Prewriting
was
a
very
helpful
writing
technique
for
me.
I
continued
to
use
prewriting
throughout
college
by
jotting
down
a
couple
of
ideas
to
organize
my
thoughts
before
I
began
writing
a
paper.
In
fact,
I
donOt
think
there
has
ever
been
a
time
in
my
life
that
I
have
attempted
to
write
a
paper
without
first
physically
writing
down
some
notes
on
a
paper
to
the
side.
This
process
of
sitting
down
with
either
a
teacher
or
by
myself
with
a
pen
or
pencil
in
hand
and
writing
something
on
paper
helped
me
organize
my
thoughts
and
ultimately
helped
me
make
a
stronger
argument
in
my
writing.
Although
I
used
this
technique
though,
I
did
not
realize
why
it
is
so
important
to
writing
until
I
became
a
WA
last
year.
Now
that
I
have
a
clearer
understanding
of
the
effectiveness
of
prewriting
I
know
it
is
something
I
will
continue
to
use
for
my
own
writing
and
as
a
WA.
WAs
use
prewriting
techniques
when
they
work
with
students.
By
using
this
strategy
with
my
peers
as
a
WA
I
realized
how
valuable
it
can
be
to
the
writing
process.
The
first
experience
I
had
in
the
past
year
that
lead
me
to
realize
how
effective
prewriting
can
be
occurred
last
fall
when
I
was
the
WA
for
a
first
year
seminar
class
(FYS).
My
partner
professor,
or
the
professor
teaching
the
class
I
was
the
WA
for,
decided
it
would
be
best
if
I
helped
the
students
by
collecting
and
reading
the
drafts
of
the
studentsO
papers
and
talked
about
these
drafts
during
our
first
conference.
As
I
read
through
the
papers
the
night
before
conferences
began,
I
realized
that
many
of
them
lacked
organization.
Thesis
statements
did
not
appear
until
the
last
paragraph,
bits
and
pieces
of
points
of
proof,
or
arguments
that
supported
this
thesis
were
scattered
throughout
each
paragraph
and
no
paragraph
was
dedicated
to
a
single
argument.
Not
to
mention,
concluding
sentences
at
the
end
of
each
paragraph
did
not
exist
nor
did
transition
sentences
at
the
beginning
of
each
paragraph.
I
must
say
that
this
was
not
the
case
for
all
of
the
papers
that
I
read.
Among
the
sixteen
or
so
papers
that
I
read
there
was
a
handful
of
eloquently
papered
essays.
But
as
I
worked
my
way
through
them,
I
hypothesized
a
reason
for
why
I
believed
many
of
them
lacked
organization.
I
had
a
feeling
the
students
did
not
use
an
outline
or
any
prewriting
techniques
before
they
began
to
write.
Finally,
when
I
sat
down
with
the
students
in
our
first
conference
one
of
the
first
questions
in
the
student-lead
session
I
asked
them
was
how
they
felt
about
the
organization
of
the
paper.
Of
the
students
who
said
they
were
not
satisfied
with
the
organization,
I
immediately
asked
them
if
they
used
an
outline
before
writing,
which
coincidently
many
of
the
students
responded
with
a
no.
NAh
ha!O
I
thought
as
I
suggested
we
used
the
conference
time
to
create
an
outline
together.
As
I
asked
the
students
a
series
of
questions
to
aid
them
in
a
creation
of
an
outline,
conference
after
conference
the
students
began
to
have
their
own
NAh
ha!O
moments,
or
moments
when
they
realized
themselves
(prompted
by
my
questions)
what
their
papers
were
lacking.
For
example,
when
I
would
ask
a
student
what
the
main
point
(thesis)
of
the
paper
was
and
ask
them
to
find
it
in
his
or
her
paper,
the
student
would
usually
flip
to
the
last
paragraph.
This
flipping
through
the
paper
would
usually
result
in
me
questioning
why
the
thesis
was
located
there,
which
almost
always
resulted
in
a
student
responding
with
something
along
the
lines
of
NOh,
I
guess
I
should
have
put
my
thesis
in
the
beginning
of
my
paper,O
so
the
first
thing
we
would
write
down
on
the
outline
was
the
thesis.
Next
I
would
suggest
going
through
each
paragraph
and
noting
how
each
paragraph
related
to
the
thesis.
This
would
also
often
result
in
an
NAh
ha!O
moment
in
which
the
student
realized
that
his
or
her
ideas
were
scattered
throughout
the
paper;
no
one
paragraph
was
entirely
devoted
to
one
argument.
I
would
ask
them
what
point
they
were
trying
to
make
in
each
paragraph
and
it
would
be
added
to
the
outline
under
the
thesis.
Next,
I
would
ask
how
each
of
these
points
they
were
related
to
the
thesis
and
this
was
recorded
under
each
point.
It
was
through
this
process
of
questioning
the
moves
the
student
writer
made
that
a
student
realized
her
or
her
paper
lacked
organization
and
that
an
outline
helped
the
student
organize
his
or
her
thoughts.
Through
one
NAh
ha!O
moment
after
another
in
WA
conferences
I
realized
how
important
outlines
or
prewriting
can
be
to
the
writing
process.
It
is
now
something
I
will
continue
to
use
not
only
as
a
WA
but
as
a
writer.
Drafting
and
revising
are
also
writing
techniques
I
have
found
useful
in
my
own
writing
in
the
past
but
never
realized
how
useful
these
steps
of
the
writing
process
can
be
until
I
became
a
WA
last
year.
Since
then,
I
began
to
understand
why
drafting
can
make
the
writing
process
less
daunting
and
I
began
to
use
drafting
more
frequently
and
have
encouraged
the
students
I
work
with
to
use
it
too.
Throughout
college
I
have
taken
many
classes
where
professors
require
students
to
hand
in
a
draft
of
a
paper
before
the
final
version
is
due.
I
would
always
complete
the
draft
and
hand
it
in
without
question,
but
I
always
wondered
why
professors
were
requiring
this
additional
essay.
However,
when
I
became
a
WA
I
realized
why
drafting
is
such
an
important
step
in
the
writing
process
and
it
is
something
I
have
continued
to
use
in
the
past
year
even
when
I
was
not
required
to.
As
a
WA
I
have
discovered
that
drafting
can
be
an
effective
technique
for
making
writing
less
painful.
This
is
mainly
for
two
reasons.
One
reason
is
because
to
write
a
convincing
argument
about
something,
one
must
have
a
clear
idea
of
how
he
or
she
feels
about
the
topic.
Drafting
gives
a
student
the
opportunity
to
develop
ideas
about
a
topic.
By
putting
the
pen
to
the
paper
or
fingers
to
the
keyboard,
a
writer
must
think
through
how
they
feel
about
something
before
writing
about
it.
After
creating
a
draft
and
getting
initial
ideas
on
paper,
the
writer
can
come
back
later
and
revise.
Drafting
also
creates
a
sense
that
whatever
one
writes
is
not
permanent,
which
I
have
found
takes
some
of
the
pressure
off
of
writing
and
makes
it
easier.
As
a
WA,
I
try
to
communicate
this
to
my
peers.
Usually
by
the
time
I
conference
with
students,
many
of
them
already
have
a
draft
but
on
a
couple
of
occasions
last
year
students
only
came
to
me
with
an
outline.
This
was
the
case
for
a
300-level
English
class
I
was
the
WA
for
last
spring.
A
few
students,
who
all
for
the
most
part
happened
to
be
upperclassmen
English
majors,
came
to
their
first
conference
with
only
a
draft.
Noting
that
the
students
had
taken
the
time
to
organize
their
ideas
with
an
outline,
I
knew
many
of
these
students
understood
the
usefulness
of
prewriting.
However,
many
of
these
students
were
unsure
where
to
turn
after
the
outline
was
complete.
For
these
students
I
recommended
to
just
to
start
writing.
I
emphasized
that
even
if
they
were
not
satisfied
with
their
writing
at
the
time,
by
beginning
to
write
they
could
purge
all
that
was
on
their
minds
about
the
topic
onto
the
paper,
which
would
help
them
form
more
coherent
thoughts
on
the
topic.
I
also
stressed
that
this
draft
was
not
concrete
and
it
could
be
changed
later
on,
so
they
shouldnOt
worry
if
the
writing
was
completely
logical.
Because
of
the
limited
amount
of
assignments
in
the
300-level
class,
I
ended
up
meeting
with
many
of
the
students
two
times
for
each
paper.
During
our
second
meeting
for
the
paper,
the
students
who
came
to
the
first
conference
with
only
an
outline
all
reported
that
my
suggestion
to
just
start
writing
everything
that
came
to
mind
really
helped
them
develop
their
thoughts
on
the
topic
and
helped
them
decide
what
to
write
about.
Since
then,
every
time
in
the
past
couple
of
months
I
have
had
to
write
something
I
try
to
do
this
as
well.
I
simply
type
whatever
comes
to
mind
about
a
topic
then
I
revise
the
paper
later
on
to
make
it
more
coherent.
By
doing
this
I
have
discovered
that
oftentimes,
when
I
come
back
to
a
paper
what
I
wrote
the
first
time
around
makes
sense
and
only
a
few
sentences
need
to
be
reworded
or
inserted
to
make
the
paper
flow
better.
By
setting
the
draft
of
the
paper
aside
and
coming
back
to
it,
I
have
discovered
that
the
problems
with
my
paper
become
glaringly
obvious
to
me
after
a
small
break
from
the
assignment.
In
fact,
to
complete
this
assignment
I
used
that
technique.
I
started
writing
the
paper
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
by
just
jotting
down
my
thoughts
about
my
experience
as
a
writer
for
the
past
year.
When
I
came
back
to
the
paper
a
few
days
later
and
read
through
what
I
wrote,
I
discovered
my
draft
helped
me
form
a
clearer
idea
about
what
I
wanted
to
focus
on
in
the
paper.
I
only
needed
to
add
a
few
sentences
here
and
there
to
tie
my
ideas
together.
Drafting
and
revising
is
something
I
have
used
as
a
writer
in
the
past
but
like
many
writing
techniques,
I
did
not
realize
how
effective
this
step
of
the
writing
process
can
be
until
I
became
a
WA.
After
suggesting
this
technique
to
my
peers
and
giving
it
a
try
myself,
I
realized
that
sometimes
the
most
effective
way
to
create
a
piece
of
writing
is
to
just
write
and
then
revise
later
on.
Talking
about
writing
is
also
an
effective
technique
writers
can
use
when
composing
a
piece.
This
strategy
is
something
I
have
always
used
in
the
past
but
like
the
other
tactics
I
used,
I
did
not
realize
how
effective
conversations
about
oneOs
writing
can
be
to
the
writing
process
until
after
I
became
a
WA.
Now
that
I
have
a
better
understanding
of
why
talking
about
writing
works
to
make
writing
easier,
I
continue
to
use
them
for
my
own
writing
and
with
the
students
I
work
with.
In
the
literacy
narrative
I
prepared
a
year
ago,
I
note
how
I
have
always
gone
to
my
teachers
to
talk
about
my
writing
throughout
middle
school
and
high
school.
I
explain
would
talk
to
my
teachers
before
I
began
writing
and
during
the
process.
In
college,
I
have
also
talked
to
my
professors
about
my
writing
as
well
as
my
peers,
especially
as
I
begin
to
prepare
a
piece
of
writing.
I
have
found
when
I
talk
to
my
teachers
and
peers
about
my
assignment
the
writing
comes
to
me
easier.
However,
it
was
not
until
I
became
a
WA
last
year
and
started
talking
to
my
peers
about
their
writing
that
I
began
to
understand
why
conversation
is
helpful
to
the
writing
process.
As
a
WA
I
have
had
countless
discussions
with
students
not
only
about
their
papers
but
how
they
personally
feel
about
the
topic
they
are
writing
about.
By
discussing
oneOs
personal
feelings
on
a
topic,
a
student
can
develop
his
or
her
thoughts
on
the
topic,
which
makes
writing
about
it
a
lot
easier.
One
specific
time
I
used
conversation
to
help
a
student
with
writing
occurred
this
summer
when
I
was
a
WA
for
a
group
of
eight
incoming
first-year
Lafayette
students
that
were
involved
in
a
pilot
summer
program
to
advance
leadership
(S-PAL).
To
get
ahead
in
the
college
process
so
they
could
be
leaders
in
their
class,
these
eight
students
spent
six
weeks
at
Lafayette
taking
calculus
and
college
writing.
I
was
the
WA
for
college
writing.
The
first
assignment
the
students
had
was
to
write
a
paper
about
the
connection
between
body
images
and
the
media.
As
I
read
through
the
drafts
of
the
students
very
first
college
paper,
like
my
experience
with
the
students
in
the
FYS
class
last
fall,
I
noticed
many
organizational
problems.
Besides
for
not
using
an
outline
to
organize
their
writing
before
they
began,
I
also
had
a
feeling
many
of
the
papers
were
lacking
coherency
simply
because
some
of
the
students
did
not
have
a
clear
understanding
of
how
they
personally
felt
about
the
topic.
Since
I
met
with
students
at
least
two
times
for
each
of
three
papers
they
prepared
in
the
six
weeks
they
were
involved
in
the
program,
I
used
the
first
conference
to
mainly
discuss
the
topic
with
the
students.
I
asked
them
questions
not
only
about
the
moves
they
had
made
in
the
drafts
of
their
papers
but
also
about
how
they
felt
about
the
topic:
connections
between
body
image
and
the
media.
These
questions
sparked
discussion
between
me
and
the
students.
The
series
of
questions
I
posed
allowed
the
students
to
better
develop
their
thoughts
on
the
topic,
and
for
the
most
part
allowed
many
of
the
students
to
leave
the
conference
with
a
better
idea
about
what
they
wanted
to
write
about
in
the
final
version
of
their
paper.
After
using
conversation
to
write
as
a
WA
I
began
to
see
how
effective
it
is
and
I
began
to
understand
why
this
writing
technique
has
always
helped
me
and
I
will
continue
to
use
it
myself
and
with
my
peers.
I
am
grateful
I
have
had
the
chance
to
work
as
a
WA
in
the
past
year.
By
working
with
others
on
their
writing
I
have
bettered
my
own.
I
now
have
a
better
understanding
of
the
writing
process.
Before
becoming
a
WA,
I
had
always
described
writing
as
coming
to
me
naturally.
However,
it
was
not
until
I
became
a
teacher
of
writing,
as
a
WA,
that
I
truly
understood
why
I
have
always
considered
writing
easy.
I
have
always
employed
certain
techniques
in
my
writing
process.
These
steps
include
prewriting,
drafting
and
revising,
and
conversation.
All
of
these
techniques
made
the
writing
process
less
daunting
for
me
and
through
being
a
WA
I
have
realized
that
these
same
techniques
can
make
the
writing
process
less
intimidating
for
others.
Now
that
I
have
had
the
chance
to
use
these
techniques
with
others
I
do
not
only
understand
that
they
work
for
me
but
that
they
actually
do
work
and
I
will
continue
to
use
them
confidently
in
my
own
writing
and
as
a
WA
this
year.
