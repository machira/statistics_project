Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative
After
being
a
Writing
Associate
for
the
past
year,
I
thought
that
I
was
pretty
comfortable
with
the
writing
process.
I
thought
that
I
could
pretty
easily
adjust
to
new
writing-intensive
classes
in
addition
to
new
challenges
thrown
at
me
through
the
College
Writing
Program.
This
past
year
at
Lafayette
College,
however,
shattered
many
of
my
complacent
feelings
and
expectations
and
forced
me
to,
once
again,
reexamine
the
writing
process
as
a
whole.
I
have
heard
it
said
that
classes
only
continue
to
get
more
difficult
as
one
progresses
through
her
college
career.
Although
I
had
two
years
of
college
writing
experiences
at
the
start
of
this
past
year,
I
quickly
realized
that
there
was
still
a
lot
for
me
to
learn
as
a
student,
a
writer,
and
as
a
WA.
Reflecting
upon
the
past
academic
year,
I
can
confidently
say
that
a
lot
of
personal
growth
accompanied
my
writing,
further
cementing
the
truth
for
me
in
the
belief
that
writing
is
a
process.
In
the
fall
semester,
I
was
fortunate
to
really
enjoy
my
job
as
a
WA
for
the
First
Year
Seminar
NStories
and
Possibilities.O
As
my
first
one-on-one
WA
job
with
a
class
and
professor,
I
was
a
bit
anxious
starting
out.
I
had
already
helped
NWAO
papers
for
the
past
year
in
drop-in
hours
and
as
an
alternate,
as
well
as
attended
the
weekly
staff
meetings,
but
it
still
was
something
else
entirely
to
know
that
I
was
responsible
for
the
writing
progress
of
about
fifteen
students.
My
time
as
a
WA
for
this
class
ended
up
being
an
absolute
delight.
Not
only
did
I
get
to
know
some
nice
students,
but
my
professor
was
extremely
easy
to
work
with.
My
partner-professor
actually
first
emailed
me
towards
the
end
of
the
summer,
before
I
had
even
learned
of
my
assignment.
He
was
willing
to
work
with
me
at
all
stages
in
conferences
and
really
seemed
to
value
my
opinions
and
appreciate
my
input
in
planning
conferences.
Since
the
students
in
my
class
were
freshman,
they
were
not
used
to
the
WA
process
and
thus
were
very
cooperative
and
willing
to
work
with
me.
From
them,
I
learned
how
others
write
and
communicate
on
more
traditional
college
essays,
such
as
their
first
writing
assignment,
to
more
expressive
ways
to
analyze
texts
with
their
group
presentations
and
creative
narratives.
The
creative
narratives
in
particular
were
something
that
I
as
a
writer
was
not
familiar
with,
so
while
being
the
WA,
I
also
was
learning
how
to
write
creatively
in
a
narrative
form.
Besides
having
an
easy
time
communicating
with
my
professor
and
students,
I
regretted
the
fact
that
I,
as
a
junior,
was
unable
to
enroll
in
that
class.
The
classO
focus
on
reading
and
novels
and
historicity
was
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
that
interested
me
and
made
reading
the
student
papers
and
discussing
them
in
conferences
much
more
enjoyable.
I
soon
learned
that
my
situation
was
much
more
ideal
than
many
others.
In
WA
staff
meetings,
we
discussed
all
sorts
of
difficulties
that
my
fellow
WAs
were
encountering.
Some
had
problems
with
missed
conferences,
some
did
not
get
along
very
well
with
their
partner-professors,
and
others
simply
had
no
variety
with
their
conferences.
Listening
to
others,
I
began
to
truly
realize
how
fortunate
I
was
to
have
been
assigned
to
the
class
that
I
had.
As
I
savored
my
own
experience,
however,
I
also
took
notes
on
what
my
fellow
WAs
said.
I
had
a
great
experience
for
my
first
official
WA
class,
but
that
did
not
mean
that
experience
would
carry
over
to
my
next
assignments.
My
spring
semester
WA
assignment
was
indeed
much
more
difficult
than
the
one
I
had
in
the
fall.
Instead
of
getting
assigned
to
a
VAST
class,
as
the
majority
of
WAs
were,
I
became
a
WA
for
a
section
of
an
economics
class.
NMoney,
Financial
Intermediary,
and
the
EconomyO
was
a
300-level
economics
class
and
initially
a
source
of
great
consternation
for
me.
Although
I
understood
well
the
theory
that
WAs
should
be
able
to
help
work
with
student
writing
for
any
class,
I
had
never
taken
an
economics
class,
much
less
a
300-level
one.
I
worried
about
technical
terms
and
just
not
being
able
to
understand
the
basic
concepts
that
students
would
present
in
their
papers.
Not
only
did
I
worry
about
the
basic
difficulty
of
me
helping
students
write
papers
for
a
subject
that
I
had
no
knowledge
of,
and,
frankly,
no
interest
in,
but
I
also
was
assigned
to
only
one
section,
which
meant
that
I
now
had
to
coordinate
meetings
and
conferences
with
another
WA
so
that
the
two
sections
could
be
helped
in
a
similar
fashion.
My
partner-professor,
while
nice
and
appreciative
of
the
help
that
WAs
provide
student-writers,
was
not
quite
as
communicative
as
my
previous
partner-professor,
and
she
was
pretty
fixed
in
her
notion
of
what
the
WA
should
do.
As
I
began
working
as
a
WA
for
this
class,
I
really
learned
to
appreciate
the
WA
staff
meetings.
Concerns
that
fellow
WAs
had
previously
voiced
no
longer
became
simply
hypothetical
issues
to
me,
and
I
began
to
really
rely
on
the
advice
of
my
fellow
WAs
and
Professor
Tatu.
One
major
issue
that
I
had
with
this
class
was
missed
conferences.
The
students
in
this
class
were
seniors
and
juniors
and
so
were
already
very
much
familiar
with
the
Writing
Program.
Since
they
were
all
upper-classmen,
most
did
not
feel
WA
conferences
were
the
most
valuable
way
to
spend
their
time,
probably
also
due
to
the
fact
that
I
was
a
WA
with
no
economic
experience.
I
could
totally
understand
that
sort
of
mentality,
however
it
proved
to
be
a
very
frustrating
challenge
for
me.
The
suggestions
given
to
me
by
other
WAs
proved
to
be
very
useful,
and
I
learned
how
important
communication
was
in
the
writing
process
in
another
way.
Previously
my
discussion
of
writing
and
the
writing
process
was
with
students
and
a
professor
eager
to
hear
my
opinion;
now
I
had
to
find
a
way
to
communicate
with
those
more
reluctant
to
hear
my
thoughts.
By
the
final
round
of
conferences,
I
had
almost
no
Nno
showsO
and
I
was
learning
how
to
write
more
technical
papers,
ones
that
were
heavily
focused
on
statistics
and
graphs
and
data.
Although
I
worried
that
I
could
not
be
as
helpful
to
student-writers
in
this
upper-level
economics
class,
I
was
pleasantly
surprised.
Like
I
said
earlier,
I
really
got
to
experience
the
idea
that
WAs
can
work
with
student-writers
of
any
discipline.
After
all,
many
of
our
NHigher
Level
ConcernsO
deal
with
things
like
organization
and
structure
and
theses,
which
should
be
something
that
the
majority
of
college
papers
should
have.
And
while
I
have
no
plans
on
taking
an
economics
class,
I
was
able
to
acquire
some
basic
knowledge
in
the
field
as
I
helped
the
students
learn
how
to
become
better
writers.
The
best
memory
I
have
of
WA
conferences
for
this
class
was
after
an
outline/pre-writing
conference
for
an
upcoming
paper.
I
felt
as
though
in
nearly
all
the
conferences,
the
students
and
I
were
able
to
brainstorm
some
really
good
ideas
and
they
walked
away
more
confident
of
where
to
go
next.
One
student,
who
I
could
tell
initially
sat
down
next
to
me
with
a
muted
displeasure
at
being
there,
stood
up
at
the
end
of
the
conference
and
told
me
that
he
found
the
conference
to
be
much
more
helpful
than
he
expected
and
felt
more
prepared
in
writing
his
paper.
One
of
the
main
reasons
that
I
decided
to
become
a
WA
was
to
help
students
become
more
enthusiastic
about
writing
and
become
more
confident,
and
this
one
studentOs
comment
made
me
feel
as
though
I
really
had
become
a
valuable
resource
to
him.
The
two
WA
classes
that
I
had
this
past
year
were
very
different
and
engendered
two
very
different
experiences
for
me.
My
FYS
class
proved
to
be
the
ideal
way
for
me
to
start
out
with
my
own
class.
Although
I
was
working
with
freshmen,
they
still
brought
a
lot
to
the
table
and
I
ended
up
learning
at
least
as
much
as
they
did.
With
my
economics
class,
I
think
I
may
have
even
learned
more
than
my
students
did.
At
one
point,
this
realization
would
make
me
feel
dismay,
but
I
have
since
come
to
realize
that
simply
because
I
learned
a
lot,
that
does
not
diminish
the
experience.
I
can
confidently
say
that
my
students
learned
how
to
become
better
writers,
and
without
an
economics
major
as
their
WA.
Through
my
two
classes,
I
learned
that
not
just
writing
is
a
process,
but
so
is
the
art
of
becoming
a
WA.
IOd
like
to
believe
that
with
these
two
completely
different
experiences
I
am
fully
prepared
for
anything,
but
I
still
expect
a
lot
of
learning
and
adjustment
to
accompany
my
next
two
assignments.
While
my
WA
assignments
did
help
my
growth
as
a
writer,
it
was
more
on
a
mental
level.
After
all,
my
conferences
were
focused
more
on
conversation
and
as
I
was
not
writing
those
papers,
I
could
not
directly
apply
those
discussions
to
my
own
writing.
I
did
indirectly
apply
what
I
learned
to
the
extensive
writing
that
my
own
classes
required.
In
the
fall
semester,
I
had
papers
for
all
four
of
my
classes.
Only
one
of
my
classes
assigned
the
more
traditional
college
papers
that
I
would
expect.
My
English
class
on
John
MiltonOs
Paradise
Lost
only
assigned
two
papers,
both
of
them
based
completely
on
a
topic
I
chose.
One
of
the
papers
required
a
fair
amount
of
research,
which
is
definitely
not
my
favorite
thing
to
do.
These
two
papers
were
each
around
fifteen
pages,
so
significantly
longer
than
essays
I
had
written
previously.
Through
this
class
I
learned
to
write
a
sustained
argument
about
a
difficult
text
in
more
depth
that
I
was
used
to.
Both
papers
proved
to
be
a
source
of
much
stress,
especially
the
research
one.
Applying
the
techniques
I
already
knew
were
effective
from
being
a
WA,
such
as
extensive
prewriting
and
talking
with
people
about
my
ideas
and
about
drafts,
I
was
able
to
successfully
write
those
two
papers.
My
other
classes
required
a
bit
more
creativity
and
a
willingness
to
experiment
with
different
writing
styles.
I
have
always
loved
creative
writing,
so
I
was
excited
to
take
the
creative
writing
class.
Writing
creatively,
though,
does
not
require
a
thesis
and
it
ignores
many
of
the
NHigher
Order
ConcernsO
that
WAs
seek
out
in
papers.
After
learning
about
how
to
write
and
look
at
papers
from
a
WAOs
perspective,
it
was
a
little
difficult
to
adjust
to
the
new
expectations
of
writing
creatively.
It
helped
that
I
like
to
write
creatively
in
my
spare
time,
even
though
those
works
are
purely
for
my
own
benefit.
The
creative
writing
was
actually
a
nice
break
from
my
other
more-academic
papers.
I
was
able
to
use
my
creative
writing
experience
and
the
knowledge
I
gained
of
how
to
critique
it
to
help
with
my
WA
class,
because
their
final
assignment
was
supposed
to
be
a
creative
piece.
I
never
would
have
initially
thought
that
my
creative
writing
class
would
help
me
become
a
better
WA.
In
addition
to
my
two
English
classes,
I
had
to
write
papers
for
an
introductory
religion
class
and
a
Spanish
class.
Writing
for
the
Spanish
class
was
actually
not
that
much
different
from
what
I
did
for
English
classes.
I
was
able
to
apply
the
same
sort
of
process,
the
only
difference
being
that
this
time
it
was
in
Spanish.
I
quickly
learned
that
an
effective
way
to
test
how
well
one
understands
the
writing
process
is
by
then
trying
to
apply
the
same
skills
to
another
language.
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
have
a
roommate
fluent
in
Spanish,
so
I
kept
to
the
same
prewriting
and
draft
conversation
process,
with
the
added
factor
being
the
language.
Although
the
essays
for
my
religion
class
gave
me
considerably
less
stress,
they
provided
their
own
challenges.
As
a
WA,
I
have
read
and
conversed
about
papers
in
a
variety
of
subjects.
Having
never
taken
a
religion
class
before,
however,
I
found
myself
having
to
adjust
to
a
slightly
different
writing
style
once
more.
In
order
to
adapt
to
this,
I
was
able
to
put
my
knowledge
as
a
WA
to
good
use.
Before
writing
the
paper,
I
talked
to
many
people
about
it:
my
professor,
friends
in
the
class,
friends
outside
of
the
class.
I
drafted
my
papers
as
a
prewriting
exercise
and
gave
myself
plenty
of
time
to
read
and
review
my
drafts.
These
four
classes
I
took
in
the
fall
semester
all
forced
me
to
adapt
my
writing
style,
but
through
perseverance
and
knowledge
that
I
have
gained
as
a
WA,
I
found
myself
more
than
able
to
withstand
those
challenges.
My
spring
semester
continued
to
test
the
extremes
of
my
writing
capabilities.
Once
again,
I
had
papers
to
write
for
all
four
of
my
classes.
My
English
class
had
the
sort
of
traditional
papers
I
came
to
expect
from
such
a
class,
however
the
twist
was
in
the
amount
of
stress
the
professor
put
on
the
prewriting
process.
Previously,
my
professors
were
always
willing
to
help
their
students
with
the
prewriting
process,
but
their
main
concern
was
the
finished
product.
This
English
professor
cared
just
as
much
about
the
process
that
writers
went
through
on
the
way
to
the
finished
product
which
made
my
writing
experience
for
the
class
anything
but
typical.
We
had
many
little
writing
assignments
due
throughout
the
semester,
but
only
one
big
paper.
Instead
of
being
assigned
a
paper
to
be
due
in
a
few
weeks,
my
professor
made
us
think
about
our
assignment
throughout
the
semester.
By
spring
break
we
had
to
submit
our
paper
ideas.
Nearly
a
month
before
the
paper
was
due,
we
were
expected
to
hand
in
drafts,
much
as
students
are
expected
to
write
a
draft
early
for
their
WAs.
My
professor
then
read
over
our
papers
and
gave
us
extensive
feedback.
I
admit
that
this
definitely
helped
change
my
writing.
Prior
to
this,
I
spent
a
bit
of
time
writing
outlines
and
maybe
some
paragraph
sentences.
But
usually
once
the
paper
is
in
draft
form,
it
stays
pretty
much
the
same.
This
classOs
draft
did
not
fare
very
well,
however,
and
so
I
had
to
learn
what
ideas
to
salvage
and
collect
new
ones
to
create
an
entirely
new
paper.
As
a
WA
I
usually
do
not
suggest
that
students
completely
change
their
papers
for
various
reasons
including
time
and
effort;
if
a
student
already
wrote
a
basically-completed
draft,
then
the
chances
of
him
going
back
after
our
session
to
rewrite
it
entirely
are
slim
at
best.
Though
I
was
initially
not
thrilled
to
have
to
rewrite
a
paper,
the
experience
helped
show
me
how
much
of
a
process
writing
can
be,
and
how
it
is
always
possible
to
make
something
better.
I
am
eager
to
apply
this
new
philosophy
in
future
WA
conferences.
This
semester
I
had
another
creative
writing
class,
as
well
as
another
Spanish
class.
Writing
for
those
classes
helped
develop
my
skills
as
a
writer,
of
course,
but
the
other
class
that
really
tested
my
writing
was
my
art
history
class.
Like
with
my
religion
class
the
semester
before,
I
had
never
written
a
paper
analyzing
a
work
of
art.
Through
the
process
of
the
paper,
I
learned
that
it
really
became
an
amalgam
of
personal
analysis
and
history
and
some
criticism,
but
until
I
started
to
work
on
that
paper,
I
would
never
have
known
so.
Writing
is
not
only
a
process;
it
is
one
that
is
constantly
changing.
That
is
something
that
WAs
do
know.
After
all,
while
writing
an
essay
a
student
may
have
one
idea,
but
WA
conferences
are
designed
to
help
the
students
figure
out
how
to
become
better
writers,
and
sometimes
the
best
way
to
do
so
is
by
changing
the
aspect
or
writing
from
a
new
angle.
I
also
joined
the
news
staff
of
The
Lafayette
this
semester.
I
was
a
reporter
my
freshman
year,
but
did
not
continue
my
sophomore
year.
I
felt
as
though
this
was
the
semester
that
I
really
began
to
understand
how
newspaper
writing
works.
Once
again
an
entirely
different
process
needed
to
be
applied
to
this
type
of
writing.
While
my
length
prose
could
be
seen
as
a
good
thing
in
my
papers,
news
writing
is
all
about
conveying
the
point
as
efficiently
as
possible.
I
struggled
to
perfect
this
style
of
writing,
but
I
was
able
to
realize
that
I
had
my
efforts
rewarded
with
articles
in
the
paper,
a
benefit
that
student
writers
struggling
with
papers
do
not
have.
My
work
as
a
WA
has
really
proved
to
be
a
beneficial
experience
these
past
two
years.
This
past
year
my
personal
writing
affected
my
abilities
as
a
WA,
just
as
my
experiences
as
a
WA
influenced
my
own
writing.
As
I
prepare
to
begin
my
senior
year
at
Lafayette,
I
am
confident
in
the
knowledge
that
I
am
a
better
writer
and
a
better
WA.
Things
that
I
once
would
have
undertaken
with
annoyance
and
self-doubt,
such
as
completely
rewriting
a
draft,
now
no
longer
elicit
the
same
feelings.
I
look
forward
to
this
upcoming
year
and
new
writing
challenges,
such
as
my
proposed
thesis.
Experiencing
writing
from
the
perspective
of
a
WA
and
a
student
writer
myself
has
led
to
even
more
invaluable
personal
growth
as
a
writer.
