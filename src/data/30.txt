My
History

was
one
of
the
first
phrases
my
chubby
hand
painstakingly
reproduced
on
paper.
Writing
was
a
completely
visual
experience
at
four.
Comprehension
of
what
the
letters
I
drew
meant
began
only
after
I
realized
that
the
phrase
on
my
paper
matched
the
phrase
in
the
book.
This
colossal
leap
of
understanding
was
always
rewarded
with
my
father's
patient
smile.
Writing
continued
to
be
a
mainly
visual
experience
throughout
my
early
elementary
education,
but
now
I
needed
a
picture
instead
of
the
actual
words
before
I
could
write.
One
of
the
results
of
my
first
grade
experience
was
the
essay,
My
Beautiful
Dress
.
I
had
to
draw
a
beautiful
rainbow
dress,
before
I
could
even
attempt
to
write
words
that
described
its'
wonder.
Pictures
always
accompanied
my
early
work.
Seeing
first
what
I
was
going
to
write
about
gave
me
the
visual
crutch
I
needed
to
pry
words
from
my
pencil.
Freedom
from
my
visual
crutch
coincided
with
two
events;
My
assimilation
into
Mrs.
Capobianco's
third
grade
classroom,
and
the
addiction
to
journal
writing
I
developed
sometime
in
second
grade.
Journal
writing
in
my
life
began
as
a
record
of
events
that
included
cleverly
spelled
sentences
such
as,
I
had
a
earake
a
mounth
ago.
In
third
grade
my
record
branched
off
into
places
where
I
could
not
rely
on
tangible
visuals.
A
voice
developed
when
I
began
to
analyze
individuals,
and
romanticize
motives
to
fit
their
actions.
My
writing
voice
placed
me
at
the
center
of
life.
People's
reactions
depended
on
the
main
stimulus
in
my
journal's
universe,
me.
Journal
writing
fed
my
ego,
and
Mrs.
Capobianco
made
me
feel
that
every
essay
I
wrote
was
a
spellbinding
odyssey.
Mrs.
Capobianco
made
me
believe
I
was
capable.
Especially,
when
she
put
me
in
charge
of
our
class
play.
Pages
of
dialogue
spouted
out
of
my
pen,
as
I
told
my
personal
version
of
the
pilgrim's
struggle
on
the
Mayflower.
Suddenly,
I
was
creating
words
out
of
nowhere,
which
was
a
notable
milestone
in
my
writing
career.
Mrs.
Capobianco
and
my
journal
instilled
in
me
the
knowledge
that
writing
could
be
used
to
feel,
see.
and
express
the
otherwise
non-visual.
Words
acted
as
a
bridge
between
imagination
and
reality.
Every
time
I
read
a
new
book
I
learned
that
writing
was
an
unduplicatable,
unpredictable
expression.
Middle
school
ushered
in
an
era
of
book
reports,
which
increased
my
appreciation
of
the
range
of
authors'
voices.
Instead
of
copying
See
Spot
run
,
or
describing
a
picture
I
was
called
upon
to
summarize
what
the
author
said
in
my
own
words.
Book
reports
helped
me
to
become
a
better
reader.
In
order
to
write
coherently
I
first
needed
to
learn
how
to
pick
out
important
ideas
and
themes
in
a
text.
Returning
to
the
text
of
my
journals,
I
realized
that
the
themes
and
progressions
in
my
journals
paralleled
the
type
of
material
I
was
reading.
In
retrospect,
the
reading
I
was
doing
served
as
a
kind
of
crutch
for
my
writing.
In
fifth
grade
I
loved
Anne
of
Green
Gables;
my
journal
writing
from
that
time
was
a
large
meditation
on
the
perfect
man,
who
would
sweep
me
off
my
feet
and
take
me
to
live
in
pseudo-intellectual
bliss.
I
occupied
my
time
in
Middle
School
and
early
High
School
with
novels
like
A
Separate
Peace,
and
A
Room
With
a
View.
Finally,
in
tenth
grade
I
read
Catch-22.
After
reading
Catch-22
I
stopped
recording
events,
and
began
to
explore
the
forces
at
work
behind
my
actions.
I
wondered
why
it
always
seemed
that
I
was
plagued
in
every
situation
with
the
same
bad
luck.
My
journal
became
a
self-absorbed
exploration
of
what
I
felt
was
my
own
inescapable
Catch-22.
High
School
introduced
me
to
new
writing
genres,
which
filled
the
time
I
had
left
after
dodging
the
Catch-22's
in
my
life.
Literature
papers
became
my
favorite
genre.
Extracting
meaning
from
a
text,
and
building
an
argument
around
my
interpretation
was
a
challenge
that
I
enjoyed.
Now,
I
was
not
only
being
called
upon
to
locate
a
text's
main
points,
but
to
use
these
main
points
to
build
an
argument.
Seeing
the
green
light
in
The
Great
Gatsby
was
no
longer
appropriate.
Deciding
why
the
author
chose
the
green
light
and
discovering
his
intent,
which
transcended
description
was
my
new
task.
Discovering
an
author's
intent
became
an
integral
part
of
my
high
school
writing.
An
essay
that
began,
I
like
this
poem
because
it
is
nice.
,
was
no
longer
acceptable.
I
learned
that
in
order
to
build
a
concrete
argument
I
needed
supporting
evidence.
Instuctor's
demanded
that
I
employ
a
new
crutch
in
my
writing.
Evidence
drawn
directly
from
the
text,
that
supported
my
interpretation
was
now
a
necessity.
Reading
into
simple
objects
to
find
deeper
meaning
became
a
sixth
sense.
I
began
to
lose
my
ability
to
see
only
the
object.
A
semester
of
creative
writing
in
my
senior
year,
served
as
a
wake
up
call.
On
the
first
day
of
class
my
teacher
passed
out
the
William
Carlos
Williams
poem
about,
white
chickens
beside
a
red
wheelbarrow
.
All
twelve
of
my
classmates,
including
myself
puzzled
over
this
poem
for
at
least
twenty
minutes.
Comments
surfaced
like,
Well
red
means
jealousy,
or
passion,
and
white
innocence.
None
of
these
ideas
seemed
to
fit
the
timbre
of
the
poem.
Smiling,
our
teacher
explained
that
the
red
wheelbarrow
was
just
that,
a
red
wheelbarrow,
and
the
chickens,
merely
chickens.
A
chicken,
just
a
chicken,
that
is
what
makes
the
poem
so
beautiful.
,
I
thought.
Language
can
convey
images
which
are
so
powerful
that
they
can
stand
on
their
own,
without
tireless
interpretation.
Realizing
that
the
spectrum
of
language
can
encompass
such
an
array
of
powerful
images,
from
the
simplest
chicken,
to
the
most
complicated
green
light,
had
a
profound
effect
on
my
writing.
Paranoia
set
in,
and
I
no
longer
knew
where
to
find
meaning
in
a
text,
or
even
in
my
own
writing.
Often,
my
writing
was
jumbled
and
lacking
direction
because
I
insisted
on
dissecting
each
image,
from
the
simplest,
to
the
most
complicated,
sometimes
using
evidence,
sometimes
not.
College
writing
made
me
realize
that
one
single
unifying
crutch
was
necessary
to
save
my
writing
from
the
meaningless
chaos
into
which
it
was
descending.
The
first
of
my
First
Year
Seminar
papers
changed
my
perception
of
what
a
college
professor
would
demand.
Implementing
my
pre-college
strategy
of
cramming
as
many
abstract
ideas
as
possible
into
one
paper,
which
I
thought
proved
I
had
thoroughly
thought
about
my
topic,
turned
out
to
be
the
wrong
choice.
I
presented
my
W.A.
with
ten
pages
full
of
abstract
ideas,
all
of
which,
I
thought
made
a
wonderful
paper.
Clearly,
my
W.A.
felt
differently.
She
explained
that
my
ideas
were
great,
but
that
most
of
them
had
to
be
saved
for
another
nine
papers.
THESIS
,
was
the
next
magic
word
out
of
her
mouth.
The
idea
of
a
thesis
statement
changed
the
way
I
write
papers.
Now,
every
paper
I
write
is
an
argument
structured
around
a
unifying
thesis,
and
followed
by
supporting
evidence.
A
tight
unified
argument
is
what
I
continued
to
work
on
creating
in
my
First
Year
Writing
class,
and
will
continue
to
work
on
in
my
second
year
of
college.
Throughout
my
writing
career
I
have
picked
up,
and
eventually
incorporated
into
my
voice
many
different
crutches.
I
know
that
I
have
many
more
crutches
to
master,
and
hopefully
the
comprehensive
writing
program
will
introduce
me
to
a
few
more
devices
that
will
help
shape
my
developing
voice,
into
a
instrument
to
be
reckoned
with.
My
most
recent
acquisition,
a
thesis
statement
seems
to
have
brought
my
writing
full
circle.
I
visualize
my
thesis
statement
and
return
to
it
before
I
form
each
new
piece
of
my
argument,
just
as
I
once
consulted
the
letters
in
the
book
before
I
was
able
to
carve
out
each
new
letter
of,
