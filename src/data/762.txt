College
Writing

Returning
WA
Learning
to
be
a
WA
is
like
learning
to
ride
a
bike.
In
the
beginning,
it
comes
along
with
cuts
and
scrapes,
nerves
and
wobbles.
Sooner
or
later,
however,
you
find
your
balance.
From
there
on,
you
are
able
to
take
whatever
is
thrown
your
way.
Last
fall
I
was
a
Writing
Associate
for
Dr.
ColatchOs
Freshmen
Year
Seminar
on
death
and
dying;
it
was
a
sombre
topic
to
say
the
least.
However,
being
new
to
the
program,
I
eagerly
sought
to
go
above
and
beyond
my
call
for
duty.
Yes,
I
was
that
WA
who
started
off
my
semester
reading
the
books
the
FYS
was
assigned,
arriving
early
to
most
meetings
and
staying
late
for
some.
Needless
to
say,
my
initial
desire
to
overachieve
did
not
last
long.
I
quickly
learned
that
despite
my
good
intentions,
this
approach
was
impractical.
I
was
finding
it
difficult
to
schedule
time
for
my
own
studies,
and
I
soon
learned
that
I
could
do
more
for
my
students
then
give
them
excess
time
and
tell
them
what
I
knew
about
the
subject.
I
served
them
better
by
allowing
the
students
to
discover
and
correct
their
own
mistakes.
Being
a
good
listener,
asking
the
right
questions,
and
giving
opinions
when
necessary
lead
to
visible
improvements
in
my
studentOs
work
at
the
end
of
the
semester.
That
alone
made
all
my
time
and
hard
work
worthwhile.
As
I
mentioned
earlier,
the
College
Writing
Program
taught
me
the
importance
of
asking
the
right
questions.
Before
my
first
WA
meeting,
when
I
found
out
I
got
the
job,
I
was
pretty
nervous.
I
assumed
I
needed
to
perfect
my
grammar
and
be
able
to
recite
all
the
technical
stuff
without
thinking
twice.
I
actually
suffered
a
pang
of
fear
at
the
thought
of
leaving
a
stray
comma,
or
misspelling
a
word
in
my
orientation
paper.
How
incredibly
embarrassing
that
would
be
in
a
room
full
of
experienced
WAs
and
English
professors.
Walking
into
a
room
of
notably
proficient
writers
and
asking
them
to
review
something
you
wrote
is
intimidating.
Once
we
began
talking
through
peopleOs
experiences
and
using
the
facilitative
approach,
however,
I
found
that
I
rather
enjoyed
the
work.
I
realised
my
job
was
not
to
puck
through
grammar,
but
more
focused
on
developing
ideas
and
working
out
how
best
to
display
them,
I
was
pretty
excited
to
be
honest.
As
we
read
example
papers,
reviewed
articles,
and
took
turns
in
open
discussion,
I
developed
a
sense
of
confidence
in
my
opinions
that
I
did
not
previously
possess.
I
realised
that
I
knew
what
I
was
talking
about,
and
WA
meetings
helped
me
to
use
that
information
to
assist
my
peers.
You
cannot
tell
someone
how
to
write
a
college
level
paper,
as
you
would
teach
a
math
problem
or
a
scientific
concept,
because
there
is
no
consistent
formula.
You
can,
however,
provide
direction
and
guidance.
As
WAs,
we
build
our
students
confidence
by
helping
them
draw
their
own
conclusions,
and
thus
give
them
something
to
take
with
them
for
the
rest
of
their
academic
careers.
Once
you
master
that
concept,
along
with
adhering
to
your
assigned
professorOs
wishes,
you
have
the
makings
of
successful
WA
conferences.
The
self-assurance
I
gained
working
for
the
College
Writing
Program
not
only
influenced
my
WA
conferences,
but
also
travelled
into
my
own
writing.
Before
I
entered
the
program,
I
never
spent
much
time
mapping
out
my
papers.
I
would
write
a
draft,
read
it
through,
edit,
and
submit.
Although
this
system
worked
fairly
well
for
me,
I
knew
that
there
was
always
room
for
improvement.
Through
our
group
meetings,
I
learned
how
to
reverse
outline
my
drafts,
and
see
the
flow
of
concepts
presented
in
my
papers
and
how
they
flowed
together.
In
addition,
I
developed
a
more
productive
system
of
revising
and
editing:
first,
working
out
how
to
most
clearly
get
my
points
across,
an
them
ensuring
my
grammar
and
punctuation
are
up
to
par.
Learning
new
tactics,
such
as
reverse
outlining,
again
added
to
my
confidence
as
an
academic
writer.
That
confidence,
and
talking
to
my
array
of
individual
students,
later
helped
me
to
better
my
writing
style,
or
voice.
Reading
a
constant
variety
of
papers
lead
me
to
pinpoint
my
own
writing
style
preferences,
and
began
implementing
them
in
my
own
work.
At
the
end
of
the
semester,
I
found
that
as
my
WA
conferences
improved,
so
did
my
own
writing.
As
helpful
as
a
lucrative
WA
conference
can
be,
they
are
not
always
easily
accomplished.
For
one,
the
students
need
to
do
their
part
by
showing
up
focused
on
the
work
at
hand.
Flexibility
and
time
management
are
crucial
to
being
a
successful
Writing
Associate.
It
is
important
to
remember
when
students
are
signing
up
for
conferences,
that
they
are
in
fact
students,
and
about
half
of
them
will
probably
contact
you
to
reschedule
at
some
point
or
another.
IOve
had
students
show
up
20
minutes
late,
contact
me
just
before
a
meeting
to
cancel,
and
some
forget
to
show
up
altogether.
Although
there
is
no
excuse
for
perpetual
lateness,
things
happen,
and
so
I
learned
to
always
begin
my
conferences
early
and
allot
extra
time
for
schedule
changes.
In
addition,
I
found
that
Dr.
Colatch
was
particularly
helpful
in
keeping
relations
professional
between
the
students
and
myself.
He
stressed
the
importance
of
WA
conferences
in
class,
informing
them
that
he
and
I
would
be
in
close
contact
about
how
conferences
were
going.
After
hearing
stories
of
my
fellows
WAs,
I
realised
that
Dr.
ColatchOs
took
such
a
prominent
interest
in
the
Writing
Program
may
have
made
the
students
more
likely
to
show
up
to
meetings,
look
at
me
as
an
authority
figure,
and
turn
to
me
for
help.
Although
keeping
up
with
time
management
and
developing
friendly
relationships
with
my
students
and
assigned
professor
were
important,
there
were
other
difficulties
I
hit
along
the
way
as
well.
For
example,
though
the
facilitative
approach
yielded
results
from
my
students,
it
did
present
challenges
throughout
the
semester.
If
IOm
being
honest,
it
could
be
unbelievably
frustrating.
I
had
this
one
student
who
could
not
grasp
the
concept
of
a
WA
conference,
no
matter
how
many
times
I
attempted
to
explain.
He
expected
me
to
read
his
paper,
tell
him
what
to
fix,
and
hand
it
back.
So
naturally,
our
conferences
felt
a
little
like
pulling
teeth,
and
resulted
in
me
doing
most
of
the
talking.
It
was
during
conferences
like
those
where
I
desperately
wanted
to
nix
the
facilitative
approach
and
just
tell
the
student
what
he
needed
to
fix.
After
seeing
improvements
in
some
of
my
other
students,
however,
I
decided
not
to
give
up
on
this
one.
I
think
it
took
me
until
the
second
to
last
paper
to
figure
him
out.
Instead
of
jumping
straight
into
talking
about
the
assignment
in
front
of
me,
I
started
with
a
causal
conversation.
This
approach
proved
successful
for
students
who
come
off
shy
and
nervous,
but
I
never
pegged
this
student
as
shy,
just
uninterested.
Anyway,
I
seemed
to
have
misjudged
him,
and
that
short
talk
about
a
recent
football
game
seemed
to
open
him
up
a
bit
more.
From
that
point
forward
he
seemed
a
little
less
timid
around
me.
Another
particular
road
bump
with
the
facilitative
approach
occurred
while
working
with
one
of
my
international
students.
This
particular
student
was,
exceedingly
hardworking
and
sweet,
but
being
of
Chinese
decent,
she
had
never
written
an
academic
paper
in
English
before
her
first
FYS
assignment.
As
a
result,
our
first
conference
turned
into
a
direct
grammar
lesson,
which
is
not
the
purpose
of
a
WA
conference.
I
found
myself
going
over
the
basics,
which
was
beneficial,
however,
I
felt
as
though
she
was
missing
out
on
being
able
to
run
her
ideas
and
concepts
with
me.
In
the
end,
we
did
get
something
accomplished,
but
all
she
truly
left
with
was
a
paper
marked
up
in
red
ink.
After
that
original
meeting,
I
scheduled
in
a
little
additional
time
for
her
conferences,
enabling
her
talk
out
the
paper
with
me
and
review
organisational
tactics,
leaving
the
remaining
time
to
answer
any
grammatical
questions
she
might
have.
Sometimes,
we
even
did
a
few
simple
drills
to
enforce
our
discussions.
Even
though
it
was
a
bit
frustrating
at
times,
this
student
taught
me
that
not
all
people
learn
the
same
way
partially
because
they
come
to
college
faced
with
different
academic
backgrounds.
I
needed
to
present
her
with
more
specific
questions,
and
focus
on
what
would
help
her
as
an
individual
as
opposed
to
what
the
class
needed
to
accomplish
as
a
whole.
In
the
end,
I
am
proud
to
say
this
student
did
fantastically
on
her
final
paper,
and
in
the
class
altogether.
One
of
my
most
rewarding
moments
as
a
WA
was
when
she
stopped
my
in
the
library
with
a
big
smile
on
her
face
to
show
me
the
positive
comments
on
her
final
paper.
In
fact,
she
taught
me
one
of
the
most
beneficial
things
I
learned
in
the
WA
program:
not
all
writers
think
the
same,
and
thus
do
not
respond
to
the
same
questions.
I
will
be
the
first
to
say
that,
as
a
freshman
or
a
young
student,
going
to
your
first
WA
conference
can
be
a
but
uncomfortable.
Sometimes,
having
someone
else
read
your
drafts
can
make
you
feel
almost
naked,
completely
bare
to
their
judgement.
After
my
semester
with
Dr.
ColatchOs
class,
I
believe
that
being
on
the
WA
side
of
the
conference
can
be
equally
as
awkward
in
the
beginning.
Coming
into
my
second
year
in
the
Writing
Program,
however,
I
feel
as
though
I
left
that
nervous
feeling
behind
me.
I
realised
that
the
more
comfortable
I
am
with
the
students
I
work
with,
the
more
free
they
will
feel
to
approach
me
for
help
both
in
and
out
of
the
classroom.
Despite
the
immense
time
commitment,
and
the
reoccurring
frustrations,
being
a
WA
is
one
of
the
most
satisfying
jobs
I
have
ever
done.
I
love
seeing
the
students
progress
from
their
first
paper,
to
their
last,
knowing
that
I
had
a
part
in
their
academic
growth.
I
am
also
exceedingly
appreciative
to
the
administration
for
all
of
the
learning
opportunities
made
available
to
the
Writing
Associates.
So
far,
I
can
honestly
say
I
love
my
job,
and
I
look
forward
to
a
great
semester!
