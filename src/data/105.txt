My
History
as
A
Writer
WA
Literary
Narrative
August
15,1997
Communicating
through
writing
has
never
been
difficult
for
me.
Writing
brings
out
my
best
thoughts,
and
allows
me
to
convey
them
with
organization,
clarity
and
style.
I
have
never
found
inner
peace
after
taking
an
exam,
but
rarely
have
I
finished
a
paper
without
a
sense
of
accomplishment.
Writing
allows
me
to
convey
my
thoughts
clearly;
confirmation
that
with
maturity
has
come
the
ability
to
untangle
complex
ideas
and
emotions
and
present
them
in
a
sensible
(or
acceptable)
manner.
While
my
high
school
fostered,
and
insisted
upon,
good
writing
skills,
I
feel
that
my
ability
to
communicate
through
the
written
word
was
there
long
before
the
bell
actually
rang.
However,
without
the
aid
of
several
people,
mostly
teachers,
I
do
not
think
I
would
have
had
the
patience,
or
confidence,
to
develop
my
writing
skills.
I
sometimes
feel
as
if
the
door
to
my
writing
ability
is
a
door
with
many
locks.
Each
time
a
lock
is
opened,
an
unrealized
capability
is
emancipated.
Many
of
the
keys
to
these
locks
I
have
recognized
and
turned
myself,
while
others
had
to
be
shown
to
me.
The
first
key
was
held
by
my
mother.
Without
a
doubt
she
is
the
one
that
opened
that
first
lock,
as
well
as
many
subsequent
ones.
Armed
with
her
Masters
in
English,
and
several
years
of
teaching
under
her
belt,
she
constantly
corrected
my
grammar,
encouraged
me
to
write,
creatively
or
narratively,
and
insisted
I
read
to
improve
my
vocabulary.
At
an
early
age,
my
mother
made
me
turn
off
the
television
and
pick
up
a
book.
What
I
read
was
my
choice,
but
it
had
to
be
a
book,
the
daily
newspaper
or
a
magazine.
I
would
never
have
admitted
it
then,
and
I
did
kick
and
scream
in
protest
(as
would
any
five
year-old
when
denied
his
G.I.
Joe
and
Transformers),
but
when
the
screen
went
black
that
day,
my
mind
came
alive.
Subsequently,
I
have
spent
long
hours
behind
the
cardboard
or
paper
walls
of
a
book
and
ever
since
I
have
been
addicted
to
reading.
Forcing
me
to
develop
a
love
for
literature
could
be
the
greatest
gift
my
Mother
ever
gave
me.
I
feel
that
reading
has
most
effectively
improved
my
writing.
Through
observation
of
other's
styles
and
techniques,
one
can
identify
styles
they
like,
styles
that
do
not
hold
their
attention,
and
either
apply
or
avoid
those
fashions
in
one's
writing.
This
is
not
to
say
that
all
a
good
writer
does
is
copy
other's
creative
styles.
What
one
should
do,
rather,
is
observe,
reflect,
create,
accept,
reject
and
ultimately
adapt
to
personal
preference,
i.e.
create
one's
own
style.
This
does
take
time,
practice
and
discipline
as
well
as
a
strong
hand
to
guide.
The
first
writing
that
I
can
remember
doing,
and
receiving
special
recognition
for,
was
in
Mrs.
Krebs's
first
grade
class
at
Heathcote
Elementary
school.
Upon
completion
of
a
simple
writing
assignment,
we
were
told
that
an
acting
troupe
would
be
coming
to
a
school
assembly
and
performing
short
stories
as
well
as
one
piece
from
each
grade.
Not
thinking
much
about
this
later
performance,
but
later
wishing
I
had,
I
wrote
a
short
poem
about
a
boy
and
a
girl
that
grew
up
together
and
subsequently
got
married.
When
the
day
of
the
assembly
came,
I
sensed
something
was
not
right
when
Mrs.
Krebs
asked
me
to
hold
her
hand
and
walk
at
the
front
of
the
line
as
we
walked
to
the
auditorium,
the
greatest
honor
that
could
be
bestowed
upon
a
member
of
the
first
grade.
In
addition,
Mrs.
Krebs
even
asked
me
to
sit
next
to
her!
By
now
I
knew
something
was
up,
and
I
knew
it
was
not
my
birthday,
so
what
could
it
be?
As
luck
would
have
it,
when
it
came
time
for
the
troupe
to
read
the
piece
they
had
chosen
from
the
first
grade,
it
was
my
poem
that
had
been
chosen.
I
remember
quite
clearly
listening
to
the
actor
recite
it
and
thinking,
"Gee,
that
sounds
familiar."
When
he
got
to
the
last
line,
which
went
something
like
"Now
we
are
older
and
love
each
other,"
every
kid
in
the
auditorium,
from
the
kindergartners
to
the
big-scary
sixth-graders,
became
hysterical
with
laughter;
all
except
one.
I
wanted
to
die.
Never
had
I
been
so
embarrassed
and
to
make
things
worse,
I
had
to
go
up
on
stage
to
receive
a
certificate.
The
walk
down
the
isle
seemed
to
last
forever,
and
I
remember
the
instability
of
the
wobbling
legs
on
which
I
stood.
The
crowd
had
now
silenced,
as
if
expecting
an
acceptance
speech,
and
their
silence
was
no
more
comforting
than
their
laughter.
However,
once
the
actor
handed
me
my
certificate,
the
crowd
exploded
again.
"Oh,
no!"
I
thought,
"They're
all
laughing
again."
But,
wait.
It
was
not
laughter,
rather,
they
were
cheering
for
me.
Now
I
was
really
embarrassed.
I
got
many
congratulations
that
day,
and
was
quite
proud
of
what
had
happened.
However,
to
this
day
I
am
still
not
completely
comfortable
with
having
my
creative
work
read,
in
my
presence,
to
a
large
group
of
people.
Some
additional
maturation
may
be
required
on
my
part,
or
more
likely,
additional
self-esteem,
in
order
to
achieve
comfort
with
myself
and
my
written
work,
and
I
really
do
look
forward
to
that
time.
One
season
where
I
found
myself
writing
a
lot
was
during
the
summer.
This
writing
was
not
assigned
by
school,
but
by
my
parents
who
insisted
I
write
home
from
summer
camp
at
least
twice
a
week.
Not
being
one
to
throw
things
away,
my
mother
has
kept
these
letters
and
I
recently
looked
them
over.
Although
they
seemed
to
be
written
in
another
language,
as
my
handwriting
is
nothing
more
than
a
scrawl,
I
was
able
to
realize
that
I
had
a
knack
for
detail.
I
owe
this
too
to
reading
often
and
having
to
pick
out
important
facts.
I
found
that
my
letters
were
quite
descriptive,
and
not
only
reminded
me
of
old
camp
memories,
but
seemed
to
bring
them
alive.
This
is
an
attribute
that
I
feel
is
important
in
all
writing,
academic
or
creative.
In
creative
writing,
I
feel
it
is
important
to
show
your
reader
what
you
are
trying
to
describe,
as
opposed
to
telling
them,
and
in
academic
writing
more
detail
allows
a
writer
to
convey
his
argument
in
a
clear
fashion.
In
junior
high
I
was
privileged
to
have
three
extraordinary
English
teachers.
Although
I
had
previously
developed
a
love
for
literature,
it
was
in
these
formative
years
that
I
developed
a
love
for
writing.
As
1988
was
an
election
year,
one
of
my
first
assignments,
a
joint
project
between
my
English
class
and
history
class,
was
to
create
an
"election
notebook."
The
notebook
had
to
contain
everything
from
discussing
what
each
candidate,
Michael
Dukakis
and
George
Bush,
had
on
their
platform,
to
pictures,
articles
and
political
cartoons
that
appeared
in
the
all-important
last
three
months
of
the
election.
For
the
first
time,
I
was
doing
real
interpretive
writing.
What
did
the
candidates'
standpoints
mean
to
me?
If
I
were
to
run,
what
would
I
do
differently?
What
is
this
political
cartoon
saying?
This
project
is
one,
along
with
my
first
grade
poem,
that
sticks
out
in
my
mind
as
one
of
my
favorites.
I
got
an
"A"
on
it,
but
the
grade
mattered
little
to
me.
I
had
fun
doing
it.
To
this
day
I
still
have
my
notebook,
and
from
time
to
time
pull
it
off
the
shelf
to
read
it.
The
administrators
of
this
assignment,
Mr.
Johnson
and
Ms.
Gross,
gave
me
another
key
in
my
literary
development.
They
taught
me
how
to
write
to
tell
my
reader
what
I
think
about
an
issue,
in
relation
to
how
someone
else
does.
They
taught
me
how
to
criticize
constructively,
how
to
praise
and
how
to
pick
apart
ideas;
they
taught
me
to
interpret.
My
sophomore
year
in
high
school
was
probably
the
most
influential
in
my
development
as
a
writer.
My
teacher
that
year,
Mr.
Arenella,
broke
the
year
in
half,
teaching
a
different
type
of
English
class
each
semester.
The
first
semester
was
spent
learning
the
basics
of
writing
an
academic
essay.
What
a
thesis,
a
body
and
a
conclusion
are,
and
how
they
fit
into
an
essay.
I
do
not
think
I
will
ever
forget
the
basic
structure
of
an
academic
essay
as
taught
to
us
by
Mr.
Arenella.
He
taught
us
that
an
essay
should
start
with
an
upside
down
triangle
at
the
top,
signifying
how
an
opening
paragraph
should
start
with
a
broad
idea
and
then
get
more
specific
culminating
with
the
thesis
at
the
point.
From
there
is
the
square
body,
where
one's
arguments
are
made.
The
conclusion,
he
taught,
should
be
a
regular
triangle,
with
the
specific
thesis
at
the
point,
and
becoming
more
broad
towards
the
base
while
encompassing
the
main
points
of
the
essay.
The
reason
I
still
remember
this
so
clearly
is
because
I
still
keep
it
in
the
back
of
my
mind
when
writing
an
essay.
The
main
writing
assignment
of
that
first
semester
was
to
write
an
argument
piece.
We
had
to
pick
a
controversial
topic
and,
eventually,
write
an
essay
professing
our
opinion.
The
topic
I
chose
was
abortion
as
1992
was
also
an
election
year,
and
the
twentieth
anniversary
of
Roe
Vs.
Wade
was
fast
approaching,
making
abortion
a
hot
issue.
I
will
never
forget
my
shock
when
I
found
out
that
our
first
assignment
was
to
write
an
essay
from
the
opposite
point
of
view.
So,
I
had
to
argue
against
freedom
of
choice.
Needless
to
say
I
had
tremendous
trouble
writing
this
piece
as
I
was
fiercely
pro-choice.
However,
I
learned
from
this
piece
that
every
argument
had
two
sides
and,
when
it
came
time
to
write
my
final
piece,
my
pro-choice
piece,
parts
were
actually
easier
as
I
knew
where
the
other
side
was
coming
from.
This
too
is
a
lesson
that
I
have
retained
and
take
into
consideration
when
making
an
argument.
How
does
the
other
side
feel?
What
argument
can
I
make
to
counter
that?
Questions
like
these
are
an
integral
part
of
my
thought
process.
The
second
semester
was
entitled
"The
Beast
Within,"
and
focused
on
interpretive
writing.
We
read
books
that
dealt
with
the
evilness,
or
sometimes
seemingly
evilness,
of
people,
and
the
course
culminated
in
a
paper
answering
the
question
"What
is
man's
basic
human
nature?
Good,
evil
or
something
else?"
That
semester
we
read
books
such
as
Macbeth.
Alive
and
Lord
of
the
Flies.
The
papers
we
wrote
for
the
books
were
all
interpretive,
and
we
learned
how
to
write
an
interpretive
essay.
The
final
paper
combined
the
lessons
of
both
papers.
We
had
to
make
an
argument,
as
to
what
man's
human
nature
was,
and
had
to
support
our
argument
with
interpretations
from
the
books.
This
was
the
first
time
that
I
had
written
anything
this
comprehensive,
and
found
that
I
enjoyed
it.
It
gave
me
the
chance
to
say
what
I
thought,
and
to
prove
why
I
thought
it
using
hard
text
as
evidence.
While
my
sophomore
year
was
the
most
formative,
my
junior
and
senior
years
had
a
lot
of
influence
on
me
as
well.
One
of
my
junior
year
courses
was
entitled
"American
Studies,"
an
interdisciplinary
English/American
history
course.
Throughout
the
year,
when
we
studied
a
specific
time
period
in
history,
we
would
read
literature
from
that
period
as
well.
For
example,
when
we
studied
the
colonial
period,
we
read
Hawthorne's
The
Scarlet
Letter.
When
studying
the
twenties,
we
read
The
Great
Gatsbv.
The
most
significant
piece
of
writing
we
did
for
this
course
was
a
research
paper.
For
the
paper,
we
had
to
read
a
novel
and
write
about
how
it
represents
events
from
the
time
of
its
publication.
I
read
Catch
22
and
related
it
to
McCarthyism.
We
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
doing
our
research,
about
two
months
if
I
remember,
and
had
to
keep
specific
notes
and
an
annotated
bibliography,
both
of
which
were
checked
and
graded
periodically.
It
was
not
easy,
but
when
it
was
over
I
realized
that
all
of
the
meticulousness
demanded
by
my
teachers
taught
me
some
of
the
most
important
lessons
for
writing
a
research
paper:
organization,
thoroughness
and
time-planning.
These
lessons
I
brought
with
me
to
Lafayette,
and
am
willing
to
bet
that
without
them,
the
night
before
papers
are
due
would
be
a
lot
more
stressful
than
they
need
to
be.
The
most
influential
writing
I
did
my
senior
year,
besides
my
college
essays,
was
in
another
interdisciplinary
class
taught
by
a
science
teacher
and
an
English
teacher.
The
idea
of
the
class
was
to
examine
how
these
two
disciplines
interact
in
nature.
For
example,
when
we
did
work
on
ecology,
we
read
Silent
Spring
and
studied
how
pollution
effects
the
atmosphere
and
subsequently
our
everyday
lives.
What
I
remember
most
about
this
course
was
that
it
was
my
first
introduction
to
poetry.
During
the
semester
we
wrote
two
poems.
One
was
inspired
by
a
canoe
trip
we
took
and
the
other
was
a
sunrise
which
we
all
woke
up
early
to
watch.
I
had
never
written
poetry
before
nor
had
I
read
a
significant
amount
of
it.
I
knew
about
rhyme
and
meter,
but
never
really
understood
how
to
apply
them
in
my
writing.
Although
I
throughly
enjoyed
our
"inspirational
trips"
for
these
poems,
I
did
not
enjoy
writing
the
poetry.
I
did
well
on
them,
and
clearly
remember
one
of
the
comments
from
my
teacher
being
"I
had
no
idea
there
was
a
poet
in
you."
Unfortunately,
I
think
he
was
mistaken.
I
do
not
think
there
is
a
poet
in
me,
although
I
do
now
appreciate
poetry
more,
and
1
think
that
what
I
wrote
in
those
poems
was
only
what
my
teachers
wanted
to
hear;
some
surreal
nature-inspired
prose.
Looking
back,
I
find
it
ironic
that
I
do
not
enjoy
writing
poetry
as
my
first
accomplishment
as
a
writer
was
with
poetry.
The
fact
that
I
learned
I
did
not
enjoy
writing
poetry
is
just
as
significant
as
if
I
had
learned
that
I
loved
it
and
tapped
into
a
newfound
well.
This
was
a
lesson
in
writing
as
well;
the
turning
of
another
key.
When
I
arrived
at
Lafayette
in
the
fall
of
1995,1
had
no
idea
what
to
expect.
Being
the
oldest
child
in
my
family,
there
was
no
one
I
could
really
talk
to
about
what
lay
ahead.
There
was
always
my
parents,
but
to
me
they
had
gone
to
college
eons
ago
and
were
out
of
touch.
When
I
first
saw
my
syllabus
for
my
FYS,
I
did
not
think
much
of
it.
There
were
no
assignments
out
of
the
ordinary.
I
felt
the
same
way
when
I
saw
my
syllabus
for
American
Studies
250,
the
only
other
writing
class
I
had.
While
all
the
other
first
year
students
were
amazed
at
the
difficultness
of
some
of
the
writing
assignments,
I
noticed
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary.
With
the
exception
of
a
few
extra
pages
being
assigned,
the
kind
of
writing
expected
of
me
was
not
really
harder
than
what
I
saw
in
high
school.
Granted
there
were
more
assignments,
and
maybe
I
was
just
lucky
with
my
courses,
but
I
had
minimal
difficulty
with
the
work.
The
credit
for
this
must
be
given
to
my
past
teachers.
They
had
me
ready
for
college.
The
high
school
I
went
to
is
notoriously
difficult,
but
all
of
the
complaining
I
did
then
was
paying
off
now.
My
FYW
that
year
was
another
focal
point
in
my
writing
career.
By
this
time
I
had
realized
that
writing
was
my
strongest
attribute
as
a
student,
and
it
was
something
that
I
wanted
to
continue
to
improve
on.
My
FYW
gave
me
this
chance.
I
was
shown
many
new
techniques
that
semester,
and
was
able
to
fine
tune
my
paper
structure.
My
personal
style
also
improved,
but
certainly
did
not
perfect
as
I
believe
there
will
always
be
room
for
improvement
and/or
change.
The
amount
of
peer
editing
we
did
in
class
also
helped
me
tremendously.
I
was
getting
positive
comments
and
helpful
suggestions
which
I
think
were
the
most
helpful
critiques
of
my
writing.
This
was
my
first
real
exposure
to
peer
editing,
and
am
sorry
that
I
did
not
have
a
chance
previously
to
employ
this
method
of
improvement.
By
the
time
the
first
semester
of
my
sophomore
year
came
around,
I
was
quite
confident
in
my
writing
and
also
quite
cocky.
I
thought
no
paper
I
wrote
could
go
wrong.
Then
In
Introduction
to
International
Politics,
I
got
a
humbling,
and
much
needed,
slap
in
the
face.
On
our
first
paper
I
got
the
wonderful
mark
of
a
"C",
the
first
time
I
had
gotten
under
a
"B"
on
a
paper
since
high
school.
I
was
devastated.
But
as
I
went
back
over
it,
I
was
happy
that
my
grade
was
as
high
as
it
was.
This
paper
was
a
perfect
candidate
for
a
workshop
on
how
not
to
write.
My
research
was
shabby,
my
main
arguments
convoluted
and
I
do
not
even
think
I
proof
read
it.
Everyone
has
20/20
hindsight,
and
employing
this,
I
realized
that
no
matter
how
good
someone
may
write,
the
basics
still
apply.
Ability
to
form
a
sentence
and
use
big
words
will
only
take
one
so
far.
It
is
the
ability
to
clearly
explain
to
your
reader
what
you
are
thinking
that
makes
one
a
successful
writer.
If
you
cannot
do
that
much,
the
rest
does
not
really
matter.
It
is
strange
sitting
here
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
bring
this
paper
to
a
close.
I
find
this
part
the
most
difficult
as
my
history
as
a
writer
is
not
yet
over.
My
years
of
schooling
are
meant
to
prepare
me
for
my
later
life,
regardless
of
what
career
path
I
choose.
I
know
that
whatever
career
I
choose
to
enter,
it
will,
in
one
way
or
another,
involve
writing.
I
have
come
to
this
conclusion
because
I
know
that
writing
is
what
I
enjoy
most,
and
writing
this
narrative
has
further
solidified
this
notion.
Looking
back
over
the
years,
I
realize
that
there
have
been
many
factors
that
have
influenced
my
history
and
development
as
a
writer,
and
know
that
there
will
be
many
more
in
the
years
to
come.
