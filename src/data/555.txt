My
development
into
the
writer
I
am
today
has
not
been
simple,
nor
has
it
been
unproblematic,
nor
is
it
complete.
I
feel
that
my
growth
has
come
primarily
subconsciously,
by
implementing
various
stylistic
nuances
I
absorb
from
external
sources.
I
do
not
recall
ever
consciously
changing
my
style
of
writing,
nor
can
I
remember
a
teacher
who
has
suggested
it
befitting.
Up
through
and
including
middle
school,
my
mother,
a
writer,
always
insisted
on
reviewing
my
scholastic
writing
so
that
she
could
impart
her
wisdom,
or,
as
I
said,
Ncriticize.O
This
undoubtedly
affected
my
early
progress:
by
consistently
receiving
her
input,
I
feel
as
if
I
have
created
a
personal
writing
style
somewhat
reflective
of
hers.
In
general,
although
it
is
difficult
to
identify
specific
instances
that
had
a
clear-cut
affect
on
my
writing,
I
can
recall
certain
happenings
that
must
have
molded
my
prose
in
some
manner.
I
cannot
pinpoint
when
I
first
learned
to
write,
although
I
do
recall
various
progressions
in
my
early
elementary
school
years.
My
earliest
English
recollection
was
at
approximately
four
years
old,
learning
to
read
with
my
parents,
who
decided
that
I
should
get
a
head
start
in
English.
All
I
can
remember
about
these
one-on-one
sessions
was
my
undying
frustration
towards
reading.
The
ability
obviously
did
not
come
instantaneously,
and
I
was
befuddled
as
to
why
this
arduous
task
was
necessary,
as
all
it
seemed
to
accomplish
was
preventing
me
from
playing
with
my
dinosaur
toys.
As
I
moved
on
to
elementary
school
I
was
most
often
asked
to
write
fictional
stories
or
pieces
expressing
myself,
such
as
recalling
my
summer
vacation
or
explaining
why
my
favorite
color
was
blue.
Writing
was
too
mundane
for
children
of
that
age,
myself
included.
As
a
remedy
for
that,
my
teachers
always
sought
to
glamorize
the
materials
of
our
assignments.
For
example,
in
first
grade
I
recall
writing
a
story
about
a
shark.
My
shark
story
would
not
have
been
nearly
as
exciting
to
compose
had
the
teacher
not
cut
out
a
dozen
or
so
shark-shaped
pieces
of
paper
for
me.
Essentially,
all
one
can
accomplish
at
such
a
young
age
is
to
establish
competence.
Learning
the
basics
of
reading
and
writing
was
obviously
crucial,
but
I
think
my
more
notable
progressions
as
a
writer
occurred
later
on.
One
of
my
earliest
developments
as
a
writer
was
during
sixth
grade
English
class.
My
first
year
in
middle
school,
it
was
the
first
time
I
had
ever
taken
a
course
devoted
entirely
to
English.
Here,
I
was
introduced
to
the
various
parts
of
speech,
the
rules
of
grammar,
and
basic
sentence
structure.
Learning
the
parts
of
speech
and
grammar
laws
was
fairly
uninspiring,
but
I
do
believe
I
benefitted
from
being
taught
the
three
basic
types
of
sentences:
simple,
compound,
and
complex.
Superficially
only
examining
the
label
appointed
to
each
type,
I
thought
implementing
a
simple
sentence
was
not
impressive
or
advanced.
Furthermore,
as
the
complex
sentence
was
the
third
and
final
one
taught,
I
deemed
it
the
most
difficult,
making
a
concerned
effort
to
employ
it
as
frequently
as
possible.
Although
I
later
realized
that
simple,
compound,
and
complex
sentences
are
all
equally
important,
I
do
believe
that
this
one
year
of
writing
did
influence
my
affinity
for
using
elongated
sentences,
perpetuated
with
dependent
clauses.
My
worst
experience
as
a
writer
was
undoubtedly
during
my
12th
grade
AP
English
class.
Not
only
were
the
expectations
higher
and
the
grading
harsher
than
even
that
of
LafayetteOs
introductory
writing
classes
(I
was
immediately
pegged
as
a
NB/CO
student
and
consistently
graded
accordingly),
but
there
was
a
noticeable
male/female
discrepancy
within
the
class.
Specifically,
there
were
about
20
females
and
only
4
males,
which
was
reflected
in
the
assigned
literature.
Although
feminism
is
a
literary
theme
that
everyone
should
experience
and
reflect
upon
at
some
point
in
their
life,
reading
The
Color
Purple,
The
Scarlet
Letter,
Pride
and
Prejudice,
and
The
Awakening
in
succession
was
slightly
overbearing.
The
pleasure
of
discussing
the
evils
of
male
chauvinism
and
the
female
oppression
thereof
in
a
predominantly
female
classroom,
although
again
permissible
in
small
doses,
became
quite
irritating
after
the
fourth
consecutive
month.
Furthermore,
many
students,
both
male
and
female,
began
to
notice
that
the
teacher
responded
differently
when
a
female
student
would
participate
in
class
than
when
a
male
student
would.
The
general
consensus
was
that
she
would
dismiss
the
ideas
presented
in
class
by
the
males
while
accepting
and
provoking
further
elaboration
on
those
by
females.
Though,
admittedly,
high
school
students
do
have
an
affinity
for
developing
creative
conspiracy
theories
about
their
teachers.
Eventually
this
caused
frustration
amongst
the
male
and
even
the
female
students,
so
much
so
that
I
myself
dwindled
into
introversion,
never
voluntarily
participating.
This
was
not
a
wise
choice.
Not
only
was
class
participation
such
a
significant
part
of
the
final
grade,
but
also
by
not
voluntarily
participating
I
was
most
often
called
on
to
answer
the
more
difficult
discussion
questions.
Even
more
unfortunate
was
the
fact
that
this
lack
of
enthusiasm
towards
literature
transcended
the
effect
it
had
on
my
grades:
at
the
time,
I
felt
as
if
I
had
been
turned
off
by
reading
and
writing,
perhaps
irreparably.
However,
I
was
able
to
resist
making
snide
derogatory
comments
towards
the
female
characters
in
the
books,
unlike
my
other
male
friends
in
the
class.
I
consider
myself
relatively
academically
persistent.
Even
if
I
struggle
in
a
course,
I
do
whatever
it
takes
to
get
by,
even
if
I
donOt
ultimately
cover
myself
in
glory.
As
such,
I
remained
in
AP
English,
unhappily
but
uneventfully,
until
around
February.
As
the
bell
rang
to
signify
the
end
of
class,
the
teacher
returned
our
in-class
essays
on
The
Awakening
and,
noticing
my
predictable
C
at
the
top,
I
simply
shoved
my
paper
into
my
backpack
without
so
much
as
reading
her
standard
malicious
comments.
Therefore,
I
did
not
realize
that
on
the
last
page
she
had
written
the
dreaded
NSee
me
after
class.O
I
carried
on
for
a
few
days,
ignorantly
blissful,
until
she
stopped
me
on
my
way
out
one
day
to
talk.
She
asked
me
why
I
didnOt
come
to
see
her,
and
I
replied
that
I
missed
her
comment.
Visibly
frustrated,
she
sat
me
down
for
what
I
could
immediately
tell
would
be
a
very
miserable
conversation.
Without
so
much
as
an
abridge
to
her
fateful
verdict,
she
simply
came
out
with
it:
she
accused
me
of
plagiarism.
She
cited
the
noticeable
discrepancy
between
the
quality
of
my
work
at
home
and
the
quality
of
my
work
in
class.
She
did
not
accept
the
fact
that
at
home,
unlike
in
class,
I
was
able
to
directly
cite
the
text
while
having
the
privilege
of
writing
at
my
own
leisurely
pace.
Basically,
I
was
being
told
that
my
writing
was
too
good
for
me
to
have
done
it
myself
while
simultaneously
receiving
below
average
marks.
I
elected
not
to
point
out
the
delightful
irony
of
the
situation,
but
instead
walked
out
of
the
classroom,
without
so
much
as
an
expletive,
straight
to
my
guidance
counselorOs
office
to
drop
the
course.
Unfortunately,
my
citing
the
reason
Nthe
teacherOs
a
bitchO
was
not
sufficient
enough
for
my
counselor,
who
recommended
that
I
take
a
few
days
to
reconsider.
After
discussing
the
issue
with
my
parents,
I
ended
up
staying
in
AP
English,
after
cutting
the
course
for
a
week
or
two
out
of
spite.
Furthermore,
my
teacher
seemed
to
realize
how
I
felt
about
her,
and
no
longer
had
the
audacity
to
put
me
on
the
spot
during
classroom
discussions.
I
survived
the
remainder
of
the
year
the
same
B/C
student
I
had
been
for
the
first
half,
without
further
incident
or
even
mention
of
my
alleged
plagiarism.
My
mother
told
me
at
the
time
that
when
I
became
a
famous
writer
I
would
have
a
good
story
to
tell.
Although
the
degree
of
fame
one
attains
upon
being
hired
as
a
WA
is
subjective,
it
appears
that
she
may
have
been
right.
My
final
experiences
in
high
school
English
understandably
left
a
sour
taste
in
my
mouth
for
writing
as
I
moved
on
to
college.
By
approximately
the
age
of
9
it
was
set
in
stone
that
I
would
declare
a
math
major,
and
after
high
school
I
couldnOt
have
dreamt
voluntarily
taking
an
English
course
in
college.
I
looked
forward
to
being
able
to
choose
individual
courses
without
being
forced
to
study
subjects
against
my
will.
However,
it
turned
out
that
LafayetteOs
distribution
requirements
were
a
blessing
in
disguise.
The
most
immediately
noticeable
difference
between
high
school
teachers
and
college
professors
is
that
the
latter
focuses
more
on
the
overall
content
of
writing
as
opposed
to
the
minor
details.
For
example,
in
high
school
my
essays
were
commonly
ridden
with
the
teacherOs
microanalysis
of
my
word
choice,
sentence
structure,
and
use
of
grammar.
In
college,
however,
it
is
more
common
for
a
professor
to
simply
write
a
few
comments
at
the
end
of
a
paper
reflecting
on
the
piece
as
whole.
This
enabled
me
to
relax
as
I
wrote.
As
I
began
to
write
naturally
as
opposed
to
constricting
myself
to
conventional
methods,
trying
to
write
in
the
NcorrectO
manner,
I
realized
I
was
becoming
a
capable
writer.
In
my
First
Year
Seminar,
College
Writing,
and
VAST
courses
I
performed
much
better
than
I
ever
could
have
anticipated
upon
entering
college
D
even
better
than
my
in
major
courses.
Confidence
in
my
ability
to
write
further
increased
upon
being
recommended
as
a
Writing
Associate.
All
of
this
prompted
me
to
take
up
a
Writing
minor,
which
I
continue
to
pursue.
This
summer,
I
have
worked
as
a
summer
intern
for
a
literary
agency.
Serving
as
the
intermediary
between
authors
and
publishers,
they
expectedly
have
numerous
tasks
that
revolve
around
reading
and
writing.
Most
notably,
the
agents
are
consistently
overwhelmed
with
manuscripts
from
would-be
authors.
Part
of
my
job
includes
reading
these
manuscripts
and
writing
analyses
on
those
I
feel
are
worthy
of
publishing,
making
it
convincing
enough
for
an
agent
to
represent
the
author.
All
my
years
of
argumentative
writing
in
high
school
and
college
have
prepared
me
for
this.
Part
of
being
convincing
is
identifying
important
themes,
symbols,
and
devices
used
in
the
literature,
all
of
which
I
was
asked
to
analyze
time
and
time
again
throughout
high
school
and
college.
Another
task
I
take
on
is
making
online
literary
guides
for
clientOs
books,
which
would
ideally
present
their
works
in
a
more
comprehensive
way,
enabling
readers
everywhere
to
understand,
appreciate,
and,
most
importantly,
buy
the
book.
Admittedly,
it
is
somewhat
uplifting
to
know
that
millions
of
indolent
high
school
and
college
students
will
plagiarize
my
analysis
of
NTuesdays
With
Morrie.O
Regardless,
having
my
writing
subjected
to
professional
review
is
a
first
time
experience,
and
the
positive
way
in
which
it
has
been
received
is
very
encouraging.
So,
that
brings
me
to
the
current
day.
I
look
forward
to
watching
my
writing
continue
its
perpetual
progression,
perhaps
even
drawing
on
my
own
experiences
and
previous
faults
as
a
writer
to
better
understand
the
difficulties
of
others.
Furthermore,
I
have
always
believed
that
the
most
effective
way
to
learn
something
is
through
teaching.
Assuming
that
holds
true,
I
stand
to
learn
volumes
about
the
English
language
and
the
brilliantly
intricate
yet
delicate
manner
in
which
it
is
conveyed.
