Literacy
Narrative
My
journey
through
writing
is
unique
in
that
it
began
far
before
I
encountered
the
formal
syntax
and
vocabulary
lessons
of
elementary
school.
On
vacations
as
a
young
child,
my
parents
instructed
me
to
keep
a
journal
of
each
dayOs
highlights.
In
my
early
years,
each
entry
included
a
large
picture
embellished
with
colored
pencils
and
a
concise
description,
dictated
by
me
to
a
parent.
The
brief
text
consisted
of
colloquial
phrases
and
exclamations,
transcribed
without
correction
by
my
parents,
who
desired
to
keep
my
journal
as
authentic
as
possible.
As
a
child
with
a
ripe
appetite,
most
of
my
entries
included
at
least
one
reference
to
the
dayOs
meals,
usually
concluded
with
a
NYum!O
But
merely
recording
my
thoughts
introduced
me
to
the
art
of
writing.
As
my
parents
continued
this
tradition,
my
writing
gradually
began
to
mature.
Each
dayOs
vacation
journal
entry
became
less
emphasized
on
illustrations
and
more
focused
on
the
prose
that
described
the
dayOs
activities.
I
also
began
to
take
an
introspective
approach
to
my
journals,
concentrating
on
detailing
my
responses
and
feelings
toward
events,
rather
than
explicitly
portraying
my
experiences.
I
had
entered
a
new,
critical
phase
of
my
writing
journey
before
even
entering
kindergarten.
Upon
my
enrollment
in
grammar
school,
I
began
the
structured
education
of
formal
writing.
Yet
before
I
could
begin
composing,
I
would
need
to
learn
how
to
correctly
harness
the
English
language.
With
lessons
on
subjects
and
predicates,
verbs
and
adjectives,
I
slowly
adopted
the
niceties
of
written
language.
Assignments
were
simple,
having
to
describe
my
summer
vacation
or
favorite
toy,
and
I
would
always
put
into
practice
the
techniques
I
had
recently
acquired.
Around
this
time,
my
parents
introduced
me
to
the
original
Star
Wars
trilogy.
Immediately
captivated
by
this
imaginary
universe,
I
embarked
on
my
own
to
write
a
Star
Wars
novel.
Wherever
I
traveled,
I
brought
along
a
pad
of
paper
and
recorded
chapter
after
chapter
of
intergalactic
space
battle.
While
there
wasnOt
much
substance
to
the
plot,
I
had
successfully
begun
to
explore
the
limitless
opportunities
of
creative
writing.
I
invented
my
own
characters,
planets,
and
spaceships,
and
brought
a
vibrant
world
of
aliens
to
life.
This
creation
was
critical
in
my
development
as
a
writer,
as
it
expanded
my
mind
to
understand
the
possibilities
of
imagination.
In
fact,
by
the
age
of
10,
I
had
honed
my
creative
writing
skills
enough
to
want
to
continue
it
professionally
after
college.
These
talents,
combined
with
the
freedom
of
elementary
school
assignments
and
my
lengthy
knowledge
of
the
Star
Wars
universe
compelled
me
to
this
conclusion.
Soon,
however,
I
was
introduced
to
the
related,
yet
different
art
of
argumentative
writing.
My
first
exposure
to
this
novel
form
of
writing
came
during
middle
school,
when
I
was
assigned
to
compose
a
speech,
highlighting
my
strengths
as
NcandidateO
for
president
of
the
United
States.
In
this
I
learned
how
to
formulate
arguments
and
support
my
position
with
valid
evidence.
For
this
assignment,
I
was
able
to
use
my
strengths
as
a
creative
writer,
and
combine
it
with
my
new
knowledge
of
persuasive
writing,
to
arrange
an
eloquent
speech
that
led
my
teachers
and
classmates
to
elect
me
as
Npresident.O
Soon
after,
sixth
grade
turned
into
a
nightmare
with
the
introduction
of
thesis
papers.
Beginning
as
brief
sentences
and
various
quotations
and
then
molded
into
a
coherent
argument,
theses
became
the
bane
of
my
existence.
They
began
as
worksheets,
with
such
prompts
as
thesis
statement,
quote
#1,
analysis
of
quote
#1,
transition,
and
conclusion
of
body
paragraph
#1.
This
method
of
composing
a
paper
was
dissimilar
to
my
traditional
writing
style,
where
I
would
jot
down
paragraphs
in
a
stream-of-consciousness
manner,
without
any
idea
where
my
story
would
lead.
The
new
worksheet
technique
allowed
me
to
view
my
arguments
before
I
began,
and
make
any
corrections
to
flaws
in
my
outline.
Today,
I
use
a
similar
system
when
outlining
my
argumentative
writings.
Even
though
many
formal
works
from
then
on
were
based
on
proving
arguments,
I
was
still
able
to
translate
my
aptitude
for
creative
writing
into
a
strong
pen
for
persuasive
writing.
I
was
no
longer
creating
space
ships
or
planets,
but
I
would
use
these
imaginative
skills
to
establish
my
reasoning
in
a
lucid
manner.
In
middle
school,
where
studentsO
assigned
writings
were
often
uniform
in
idea
and
style,
my
teachers
often
commented
on
my
uniqueness
as
a
writer.
I
was
able
to
conceive
sophisticated
arguments
where
many
peers
could
not.
In
addition
to
the
grammatical
and
stylistic
instruction
I
received
in
school,
I
garnered
even
more
when
I
shared
my
pre-graded
assignments
with
my
father.
A
professional
writer
himself,
he
was
able
to
impart
to
me
much
knowledge
regarding
colloquialisms
and
common
mistakes,
like
correcting
the
ever-present
passive
voice.
His
assistance
not
only
helped
me
on
individual
papers,
but
with
his
guidance,
I
was
able
to
become
a
much
more
adept
writer
in
the
long
run.
High
school
English
classes
brought
new,
unexpected
challenges
to
writing.
Papers
needed
to
be
longer,
arguments
more
profound,
and
explanations
more
detailed.
With
the
increasing
amount
of
practice,
I
became
more
and
more
adept
at
analyzing
and
describing
my
position
on
assignments.
Where
I
had
not
been
given
ample
opportunities
of
creative
writing
in
middle
school,
I
began
to
thrive
in
this
aspect
in
high
school.
I
enrolled
in
an
expository
writing
class,
where
my
teacher
would
often
ask
me
to
read
my
essays
aloud
to
the
class,
to
give
them
an
example
of
a
perfect
piece.
My
early
creation
of
the
Star
Wars
novel
gave
me
the
practice
to
thrive
in
such
a
class.
Additionally,
I
became
a
staff
member
of
the
school
newspaper.
For
this
role,
I
combined
my
love
of
music,
which
I
had
acquired
during
my
childhood,
and
combined
it
with
my
passion
for
creative
writing,
to
become
a
music
critic.
Through
this
position,
I
began
to
understand
the
serious
impact
of
writing.
After
an
article
had
been
published,
I
immediately
received
the
accolades
from
both
peers
and
teachers
alike.
It
humbled
me
to
realize
that
a
mere
freshman
student
like
myself
could
reach
out
to
the
public
in
such
a
way.
I
was
most
awestruck
when
my
math
teacher
began
quoting
in
class
some
of
my
witty
one-liners
from
my
review
of
John
ScofieldOs
fusion
guitar
album,
A
Go
Go,
as
it
was
his
favorite
record.
Then
Ms.
Defeo
became
my
English
teacher.
I
had
heard
rumors
about
her
notoriously
tough
tests
and
harsh
grading
from
previous
classes.
I
soon
discovered
that
they
were
indeed
facts,
yet
I
learned
more
from
Ms.
Defeo
than
I
did
from
any
other
teacher
in
high
school.
Every
Monday,
we
were
tested
on
vocabulary
and
grammar,
which
we
were
assigned
to
study
on
our
own.
The
grammar
covered
everything
from
the
distinction
between
affect
and
effect
to
problematic
spelling
words
like
Wednesday.
My
frequent
memorization
of
the
English
syntax
laws
have
caused
them
to
be
imprinted
on
my
mind,
and
even
today
I
am
a
proficient
grammarian.
This
aided
me
greatly
when
composing
papers
for
Ms.
Defeo.
Not
only
did
your
paper
have
to
include
intelligent
arguments
and
relevant
details,
but
it
also
had
to
be
grammatically
flawless.
The
end
of
the
year
consummated
in
our
major
research
papers.
We
were
to
choose
an
author
and
analyze
his
life
through
his
or
her
works.
In
selecting
Ernest
Hemmingway,
I
began
a
vastly
interesting
study
that
brought
me
through
all
aspects
of
his
life,
intertwined
with
his
novels,
The
Sun
Also
Rises,
For
Whom
the
Bell
Tolls,
A
Farewell
to
Arms,
and
The
Old
Man
and
The
Sea.
I
was
able
to
incorporate
HemmingwayOs
experiences
in
World
War
I
and
subsequent
misogyny
into
a
thesis
that
included
HemmingwayOs
fear
of
emasculation.
Although
she
is
a
strict
feminist
who
staunchly
disagrees
with
HemmingwayOs
sentiments
toward
women,
Ms.
Defeo
completely
agreed
with
my
thesis.
For
my
first
large-scale
research
paper,
I
had
accomplished
a
great
feat:
impressing
the
impossible
Ms.
Defeo.
During
our
unit
on
poetry,
Ms.
Defeo
assigned
each
student
in
our
class
to
arrange
a
poetry
book,
composed
of
various
styles
of
poems,
from
haiku
to
sonnet.
Impressed
with
my
finished
product,
Ms.
Defeo
labeled
me
as
the
classOs
resident
Robert
Frost.
To
this
day,
I
am
not
sure
she
meant
this
tag
as
a
compliment,
but
at
least
my
work
affected
her.
After
all,
this
is
a
major
purpose
of
poetry.
Because
of
Ms.
DefeoOs
rigorous
teaching
and
grading,
I
felt
perfectly
prepared
for
college
writing.
I
found
my
grammatical
skills
and
analytical
abilities
to
be
vastly
superior
to
many
of
my
classmates.
Although
I
have
chosen
a
path
toward
science
with
a
major
in
Biology
and
a
concentration
in
medicine,
I
will
always
recognize
the
importance
of
writing
in
all
professions.
Since
in
college,
I
have
begun
to
compose
more
writings
concerning
the
sciences,
a
skill
which
takes
a
very
different
approach
than
traditional
literary
writings.
This
is
a
fact
that
I
have
had
to
adapt
to
over
the
months
since
my
entrance
into
higher
education.
While
my
future
profession
as
a
doctor
may
not
call
upon
me
to
compose
theses
or
argumentative
essays,
the
skills
that
I
have
learned
throughout
my
continuing
education
are
vital
to
my
skills
as
a
speaker
and
a
debater.
I
hold
this
sentiment
true
as
I
continue
through
my
studies
in
college,
continuing
to
do
my
best
in
all
academic
subjects.
