Fall
2006
Give-and-Take
I
am
a
writer.
That
is
not
meant
to
be
a
statement
of
arrogance
or
an
indicator
of
pretension,
but
rather
an
assertion
of
fact.
As
I
thoroughly
detailed
in
my
previous
narrative,
writing
has
forever
been
an
essential
component
of
my
life,
and
has
contributed
greatly
to
the
definition
of
who
I
am
not
only
as
a
student
but
as
a
complete
person
as
well.
The
written
word
has
always
possessed
a
certain
mystique
and
power
for
me,
and
I
have
found
(more
so
recently
than
in
previous
years)
that
I
have
been
very
fortunate
in
my
ability
to
consistently
hone
my
skills
in
an
effort
to
more
effectively
express
myself
to
the
world.
Indeed,
writing
is
my
primary
tool
for
communicating
with
the
wide
variety
of
people
I
come
across
on
a
daily
basis.
In
fact,
even
when
I
am
not
actually
performing
the
act
of
writing
I
am
still
growing
and
testing
myself
as
a
writer
as
I
compose
and
toy
with
words
in
my
mind.
The
written
word,
to
me,
is
a
product
of
the
spoken
or
mentally
conceived
word,
and
it
is
the
ability
to
transcribe
the
latter
into
the
former
that
allows
one
to
develop
into
a
truly
great
writer.
In
consideration
of
my
continual
growth
and
development
as
a
writer,
I
can
truthfully
state
that
this
past
year
has
been
one
of
especially
high
importance
in
terms
of
the
sharpening
of
my
skills
and
the
broadening
of
my
awareness.
While
I
experienced
many
different
types
of
writing
in
my
various
classes
last
year,
it
was
most
certainly
my
experiences
as
a
first-year
Writing
Associate
(WA)
that
had
the
greatest
impact
on
my
identity
as
a
writer.
Unfortunately,
I
believe
it
is
fair
to
assert
that
many
Lafayette
students
view
WAs
as
dictatorial
(or
perhaps
authoritative)
figures
who
bestow
their
acute
knowledge
of
writing
upon
the
Nlesser
endowedO
student
body.
In
fact,
I
can
honestly
admit
that
this
is
how
I
viewed
WAs
before
I
became
one
myself,
and
I
did
not
firmly
believe
that
I
would
undergo
significant
personal
growth
as
a
result
of
my
newly
acquired
position.
This
perception,
however,
could
not
be
any
further
from
the
truth.
As
much
as
I
believe
I
contribute
to
the
College
Writing
Program
(CWP)
and
the
writing
abilities
of
the
many
students
with
whom
I
work
(for
I
would
not
accept
employment
in
a
position
in
which
I
did
not
feel
I
was
capable),
I
have
gained
even
more
so
personally
from
my
experiences
as
a
WA
thus
far.
Indeed,
it
is
this
very
give-and-take
nature
of
the
WA
position
that
has
benefited
me
so
greatly
as
a
writer
and
as
a
confident
adult.
It
is
only
fitting
that
I
begin
by
discussing
my
first
course
assignment
as
a
WA:
Marketing
Science,
an
upper-level
Business/Econ
class
taught
by
the
traditionally
tough
and
rigorous
Professor
Ruebeck.
While
I
do
not
wish
to
be
overly
dramatic,
it
goes
without
saying
that
my
virgin
eyes
literally
popped
out
of
their
sockets
when
I
received
a
friendly
summer
email
from
Professor
Ruebeck
welcoming
me
as
the
WA
for
his
course.
I
assumed
that
as
a
first-year
WA,
and
a
young
one
at
that,
I
would
be
assigned
to
work
with
an
FYS
so
that
I
could
impart
all
of
my
elderly
wisdom
and
experience
upon
LafayetteOs
newest
beloved
group
of
eager
yet
overly
zealous
freshman.
I
did
not
expect
to
be
mentoring
a
class
of
hardnosed
Business/Econ
majors
(a
discipline
I
know
very
little
about),
most
of
whom
were
older
and
arguably
more
experienced
in
life
than
myself!
However,
never
being
one
to
back
down
from
a
challenge,
I
decided
to
accept
the
assignment
and
do
my
best
to
be
a
productive
WA
and
help
these
students
in
any
way
I
could.
Luckily,
I
can
look
back
on
this
first
assignment
and
view
it
as
an
extremely
positive
one,
because
it
taught
me
that
writing
transcends
the
barriers
of
age
and
discipline
(even
one
as
foreign
as
Business/Econ).
This
is
a
crucial
lesson
that
all
writers
should
learn,
and
it
is
not
one
to
be
taken
lightly.
Initially,
I
assumed
that
because
I
did
not
have
a
strong
background
in
the
ideas
and
materials
about
which
these
students
would
be
writing
I
could
be
of
little
help
to
them.
In
a
sense,
I
possessed
this
notion
that
in
order
to
write
well
or
critically
assess
and
analyze
the
writing
of
others,
one
needs
to
know
and
understand
the
subject
about
which
he
or
she
is
writing.
This,
however,
is
a
rather
narrow
view
of
writing,
and
if
taken
seriously
one
that
wraps
a
developing
writer
in
chains
and
prevents
him
or
her
from
achieving
continual
growth.
One
can
know
all
that
there
is
to
know
about
a
given
subject
but
fail
to
express
their
ideas
in
any
interesting
or
coherent
manner
due
to
the
lack
of
skills
related
to
being
a
quality
writer.
On
the
other
hand,
it
is
possible
that
one
who
knows
little
about
that
same
subject
can
produce
a
far
more
fascinating
and
well-written
analysis
because
they
are
familiar
and
well-versed
in
the
capabilities
of
the
written
word.
I
found
that
even
though
I
did
not
understand
the
finer
details
of
marketing
I
was
able
to
help
these
students
immensely
with
their
ability
to
produce
well-written
discourses.
Through
this
experience
I
learned
that
I
can
assist
virtually
any
student
with
the
absolute
confidence
in
knowing
that
my
knowledge
and
abilities
as
a
writer
stand
on
their
own
legs.
My
experiences
as
a
WA
also
demonstrated
to
me
(repeatedly)
that
writing
is
a
truly
interactive
process.
Personally,
what
I
find
to
be
one
of
the
more
interesting
aspects
of
being
a
WA
is
that
in
any
given
semester
I
get
to
work
with
a
class
comprised
of
more
than
a
dozen
students
who
each
possess
their
own
unique
skills
and
histories
as
writers
and
as
people.
Aside
from
this
keeping
the
job
interesting
as
I
am
virtually
guaranteed
that
no
two
sessions
will
be
exactly
the
same,
it
affords
me
the
opportunity
to
have
meaningful
conversations
and
exchanges
with
a
wide
variety
of
writers.
One
situation
which
did
a
particularly
good
job
at
illuminating
this
to
me
occurred
in
the
spring
semester
with
the
VAST
I
was
assigned
to
guide.
While
many
of
the
assignments
I
had
been
asked
to
work
with
previous
to
this
point
had
been
fairly
clear
and
concrete,
this
particular
assignment
required
the
students
to
devise
their
own
creative
style
and
method
of
presenting
the
information
learned
in
the
course
(a
course
involving
genetic
engineering,
cloning,
and
other
controversial
topics
similar
in
nature).
I
found
this
assignment
to
be
a
very
interesting
one
for
both
myself
and
the
students.
Instead
of
being
forced
to
write
another
standard
research
paper,
most
of
the
students
appeared
to
be
excited
by
this
assignment
because
it
was
truly
limitless
in
terms
of
what
they
were
able
to
create.
The
products
they
eventually
produced
made
this
excitement
quite
evident.
Thus,
instead
of
reading
20
papers
written
in
the
same
format
about
the
same
subject,
I
was
presented
with
20
completely
unique
pieces.
Some
students
wrote
short
fiction
pieces,
while
others
chose
to
write
screenplays
or
popular
magazine
articles.
Not
only
did
this
prevent
me
from
succumbing
to
boredom,
but
it
also
allowed
me
to
reflect
on
my
own
creative
choices
and
how
I
myself
would
have
approached
such
an
open-ended
assignment.
Personally,
I
have
not
yet
had
the
opportunity
to
produce
such
a
creative
piece
at
Lafayette,
and
I
cannot
say
with
any
degree
of
confidence
that
I
would
feel
comfortable
with
such
an
assignment
if
it
was
presented
to
me.
There
is
something
very
comforting
about
the
rules
and
standards
that
accompany
the
typical
college
paper
assignment,
partly
because
the
more
I
write
these
formulaic
papers
the
more
confident
I
become
in
my
ability
to
do
so
outstandingly.
It
is
that
comfort
that
generally
accompanies
familiar
territory;
that
feeling
of,
NI
know
I
can
do
this
for
I
have
done
so
on
many
occasions.O
However,
after
working
with
these
students
on
this
assignment
and
spending
a
considerable
amount
of
time
in
between
the
conferences
reflecting
on
its
nature,
I
realized
that
part
of
being
a
great
writer
is
possessing
the
daring
to
continually
challenge
oneself
and
really
test
the
limits
of
oneOs
ability
to
manipulate
the
written
word.
I
came
to
the
realization
that
I
have
not
greatly
tested
my
completely
unstructured
creative
side
for
quite
some
time
as
far
as
writing
is
concerned,
and
that
it
is
something
that
I
both
miss
and
wish
to
recapture.
As
such,
I
am
determined
to
work
on
some
creative
pieces
of
my
own
which
will
allow
me
to
unleash
an
uninhibited
style
of
writing
that
has
perhaps
been
absent
(or
at
least
partially
hidden)
in
more
recent
years.
I
look
back
on
this
experience
with
the
VAST
papers
as
being
one
that
has
truly
opened
my
eyes
and
broadened
my
understanding
of
what
it
means
to
be
a
writer.
While
I
could
spend
dozens
of
pages
discussing
some
of
the
more
positive
experiences
I
underwent
during
my
first
year
as
a
WA,
I
did
not
make
it
through
the
year
without
finding
myself
in
some
more
difficult
and,
at
times,
unpleasant
situations.
One
that
had
a
particularly
great
impact
on
my
identity
not
only
as
a
writer
but
as
a
strong
and
determined
individual
occurred
early
in
the
year,
shortly
after
my
first
round
of
meetings
with
the
Marketing
Science
students.
While
I
do
not
wish
to
divulge
the
finer
details
of
the
predicament
in
which
I
found
myself,
I
do
feel
that
it
is
necessary
to
briefly
mention
it
as
it
has
had
a
major
impact
on
my
status
as
a
WA.
For
a
variety
of
reasons,
I
came
to
believe
early
in
the
fall
semester
that
I
had
committed
a
huge
mistake
by
becoming
a
WA,
and
that
I
had
overloaded
myself
with
an
important
job
that
I
could
not
even
perform
very
well.
This
crisis
of
confidence
hardly
compares
to
some
of
the
more
epic
ones
experienced
by
our
truly
great
literary
figures,
but
it
was
significant
enough
to
lead
me
to
taking
actions
in
an
attempt
to
resign
from
my
position
and
turn
my
back
on
the
CWP
program.
However,
I
will
never
forget
the
unrelenting
confidence
the
CWP
faculty
members
expressed
towards
me,
and
their
insistence
that
I
stay
on
board
and
perform
the
job
they
all
fully
believed
I
was
more
than
capable
of
performing.
After
careful
consideration,
I
decided
that
I
would
finish
up
the
semester
(thus
fulfilling
my
commitment)
and
then
promptly
terminate
my
career
as
a
WA.
Fortunately,
though,
as
I
continued
to
meet
with
my
assigned
students
and
attend
the
weekly
staff
meetings
(a
great
time
to
interact
with
other
WAs!),
I
began
to
recognize
my
strengths
and
abilities
and
realize
that
the
CWP
faculty
members
were
right:
I
had
the
potential
to
be
an
excellent
WA.
To
this
day,
I
look
back
at
that
experience
as
my
defining
moment
as
a
WA,
and
have
no
regrets
concerning
my
crisis
of
confidence.
I
believe
that
my
ability
to
Nstick
with
itO
and
ultimately
rebound
from
my
doubts
and
truly
excel
as
a
WA
is
a
testament
to
my
integrity
and
fortitude.
Needless
to
say,
this
experience
provided
me
with
an
invaluable
life
lesson,
namely
that
simply
by
refusing
to
give
up
and
persevering
I
can
turn
a
seemingly
negative
situation
into
an
extremely
positive
and
beneficial
one.
There
were
also
times
over
the
past
year
that
I
would
work
with
students
who
simply
did
not
wish
to
meet
with
me,
and
only
appeared
because
they
would
lose
points
on
their
final
grade
if
they
did
not.
As
uncomfortable
and
unpleasant
as
the
conferences
with
these
students
often
were,
they
most
certainly
have
helped
me
become
a
stronger
WA
and
a
stronger
writer.
First,
I
learned
that
as
far
as
being
a
WA
is
concerned,
one
really
has
to
be
willing
to
deal
with
a
wide
array
of
personalities.
Every
WA
loves
working
with
that
student
who
comes
in
with
a
more
than
complete
draft,
and
who
is
excited
to
discuss
his
work
with
his
peers
in
a
constructive
and
respectful
manner
(and,
if
we
are
lucky,
we
all
get
a
few
of
those
students
in
our
class!).
The
fact
is,
though,
that
many
of
the
students
a
WA
will
be
assigned
to
work
with
are
not
very
excited
to
reveal
their
writing
to
their
WA.
This
is
where
tact
and
patience
are
necessary!
WAs
must
be
willing
to
accept
the
fact
that
even
though
not
all
students
want
to
discuss
their
writing
it
is
still
possible
to
conduct
a
successful
session
and
help
them
with
their
writing.
I
have
had
many
meetings
where
I
started
out
the
session
with
one
approach,
realized
that
it
was
not
going
to
be
very
successful,
and
so
backed
up
and
tried
a
new
approach.
Surprisingly,
simply
possessing
the
willingness
to
Nroll
with
the
punchesO
and
maintain
a
flexible
and
dynamic
game
plan
can
make
all
the
difference
in
terms
of
a
WAOs
success,
and
by
keeping
this
mindset
I
have
managed
to
turn
many
bumps
in
the
road
into
positive
experiences.
I
have
also
found
that
working
with
some
of
the
more
difficult
(or
perhaps
less
enthusiastic)
students
forces
me
to
more
deeply
consider
my
own
writing
so
that
I
can
aid
them
in
constructing
a
quality
product.
There
have
been
times
when
I
have
been
presented
with
a
paper
that
appears
to
be
so
far
off
the
mark
that
I
do
not
even
know
how
to
turn
it
around
as
the
meeting
begins.
In
a
way,
this
leads
me
to
adopting
the
mindset
that
this
is
my
very
own
paper,
and
so
I
will
brainstorm
with
the
author
as
if
I
was
brainstorming
for
myself,
and
as
we
do
this
together
we
can
usually
come
up
with
a
solid
plan.
Situations
such
as
these
compel
me
to
test
and
retest
my
skills,
and
writing
is
like
any
other
art:
the
more
one
practices
it
the
more
skilled
he
or
she
becomes.
While
I
am
not
always
able
to
have
the
most
impressive
dialogues
with
these
unprepared
students,
I
am
generally
able
to
send
them
off
in
a
positive
direction,
while
at
the
same
time
sharpening
my
skills
so
that
when
I
get
stuck
on
a
paper
of
my
own
down
the
road
I
will
be
better
prepared
to
overcome
the
writerOs
block!
As
I
mentioned
earlier,
most
of
my
development
as
a
writer
over
the
past
year
has
come
as
a
result
of
my
experiences
as
a
WA.
That
is
not
to
say,
however,
that
my
own
coursework
did
not
play
a
role
in
my
development
as
well.
One
class
that
had
a
particularly
profound
impact
on
my
writing
was
Early
American
Political
Thought
with
Professor
Joshua
Miller.
This
was
certainly
not
my
first
political
theory
class
at
Lafayette
(as
I
have
attempted
to
take
as
many
theory
classes
as
possible
in
my
first
two
years),
but
Professor
Miller
holds
his
students
to
exceptionally
high
standards
when
it
comes
to
their
writing.
At
first,
I
found
this
to
be
frustrating,
as
I
was
not
used
to
having
my
writing
dissected
in
such
a
thorough
manner.
I
viewed
his
constructive
criticism
as
being
purely
negative,
and
did
not
wish
to
even
consider
that
so
many
little
details
could
help
improve
my
already
strong
writing
skills.
However,
over
time
my
stubbornness
began
to
gradually
subside,
and
I
began
to
consider
his
comments
and
criticisms
more
thoughtfully
and
incorporate
some
of
his
advice
into
future
products.
I
realized
that
every
writer
can
benefit
from
constructive
criticism,
and
that
instead
of
getting
defensive
one
should
take
the
criticisms
of
others
into
account
and
assess
their
validity
before
dismissing
them.
Once
I
was
able
to
do
this
I
realized
that
while
I
did
honestly
disagree
with
some
of
his
criticisms,
others
were
actually
valid,
and
could
lead
to
me
creating
even
stronger
papers.
Thus,
I
learned
that
the
insight
of
others
should
never
be
dismissed
before
being
carefully
considered,
because
sometimes
it
really
does
take
the
view
of
an
outside
reader
to
pick
up
on
things
that
the
writer
himself
neglects
to
notice.
All
in
all
I
can
say
with
a
great
deal
of
confidence
that
my
many
experiences
last
year
both
as
a
WA
and
as
a
student
genuinely
impacted
my
growth
and
development
as
a
writer.
While
being
a
WA
has
many
advantages,
I
believe
that
by
far
the
most
profound
is
that
one
definitely
takes
away
as
much
(if
not
more)
as
one
contributes
to
the
program
and
the
many
students
with
whom
one
works.
As
I
head
into
this
new
year,
with
a
whole
new
set
of
challenges
and
opportunities
ahead
of
me,
I
look
forward
to
pushing
myself
even
further
and
discovering
skills
and
abilities
that
perhaps
I
do
not
even
know
I
possess.
One
lesson
I
definitely
learned
from
my
first
year
as
a
WA
is
that
one
never
fully
knows
what
lies
ahead,
and
so
it
is
best
to
be
constantly
willing
to
adapt
to
new
situations
and
change
both
oneOs
mindset
and
oneOs
physical
approach
if
necessary.
So,
as
the
summer
dwindles
and
the
fall
semester
looms
on
the
horizon,
I
can
honestly
say
that
I
am
ready
to
take
on
a
new
set
of
adventures!
