Prof.
Falbo
Writing
As
a
WA
Last
summer
I
began
my
WA
experience
by
composing
Lessons
in
Writing,
a
literacy
narrative
in
which
I
explored
and
explained
the
formative
experiences
that
shaped
my
first
nineteen
years
as
a
writer.
At
first,
I
found
it
challenging
to
tailor
my
essay
in
a
way
that
was
narrow
enough
to
thoroughly
examine
my
development
as
a
writer
yet
broad
enough
to
generate
basic
conclusions
about
my
status
as
a
student.
Searching
the
archives
of
my
literacy
history
for
the
perfect
place
to
begin,
an
appropriate
place
to
end,
and
the
information
to
include
in
between,
I
flipped
through
our
summer
WA
packet
to
the
assignment
for
returning
WAOs.
Suddenly,
I
felt
a
wave
of
relief,
for
the
task
at
hand
seemed
comparatively
easier.
I
had
nearly
two
decades
of
experiences
to
draw
from
while
my
older
peers
had
merely
two
semesters.
How
much
could
they
really
write?
How
much
could
really
have
changed
in
this
short
span
of
time?
As
I
begin
this
assignment
with
an
extra
year
of
experience
and
a
semester
of
WA
work
under
my
belt,
I
am
awestruck
by
the
abundant
knowledge
I
have
acquired
and
the
vast
changes
I
have
undergone
in
a
seemingly
short
365
days.
In
passing
a
magnifying
glass
over
the
2003-2004
school-year,
a
kaleidoscope
of
images
bombards
my
eyes.
Viewed
under
this
intensified
lens,
miniscule
experiences
become
meaningful
additions
to
the
pages
of
my
literacy
history.
My
sophomore
year
at
Lafayette
afforded
me
the
opportunity
to
grow
as
a
student
and
person
in
ways
both
anticipated
and
unforeseen.
I
entered
the
year
expecting
to
work
with
other
students
as
a
WA,
to
challenge
myself
in
the
classroom,
to
explore
various
course
options,
to
determine
a
major,
and
to
continue
the
development
of
friendships
with
professors
and
peers.
Though
I
am
satisfied
that
I
accomplished
these
important
but
somewhat
general
goals,
I
am
amazed
as
I
reflect
upon
the
year
and
realize
that
my
actual
experiences
far
exceed
any
conscious
expectations.
From
my
work
as
a
WA,
to
the
time
I
spent
with
ESL
students
in
Easton,
to
studying
abroad,
to
refining
various
aspects
of
my
writing
in
non-English
courses,
I
can
through
retrospect
appreciate
the
tremendous
knowledge
I
have
acquired
over
the
year.
When
examined
individually,
each
experience
is
minor.
Viewed
cumulatively,
however,
one
can
comprehend
how
each
situation
and
every
change
merge
to
form
a
year
rich
in
personal
and
academic
growth.
Though
I
never
doubted
my
experience
as
a
WA
would
be
influential,
to
predict
with
any
certainty
the
intricacies
that
would
lead
to
a
successful
semester
is
like
trying
to
fit
a
square
peg
into
a
round
hole.
As
a
new
WA
assigned
to
a
class
of
first-year
seminar
students,
I
met
with
the
class
to
introduce
myself
and
establish
the
basic
framework
of
our
student/WA
relationship.
Soon
thereafter
I
received
my
first
stack
of
compositions,
and
I
began
to
read
with
great
excitement;
like
ElmerOs
to
construction
paper,
I
was
glued
to
each
essay,
highlighting
the
areas
I
liked
and
indicating
the
areas
that
could
be
improved.
To
my
surprise,
I
still
struggled
to
remember
the
finer
aspects
to
address
with
each
student,
despite
my
best
efforts
to
prepare
for
the
meetings.
An
older
WA
observed
that
instead
of
scheduling
back-to-back
conferences,
she
found
it
helpful
to
leave
10-15
minutes
between
sessions
to
review
each
paper
before
the
student
arrived.
This
simple
solution
proved
invaluable,
and
the
next
round
of
conferences
was
not
only
much
easier
for
me
but
was
also
more
beneficial
to
my
students.
My
own
advice
to
new
WAOs
is
to
read
the
papers
ahead
of
time,
make
notes
to
serve
as
reminders,
but
most
importantly,
schedule
enough
time
in
between
appointments
to
review
the
essay
and
issues
to
address.
In
addition
to
the
notes
and
outlines
I
made
on
each
paper,
I
encouraged
students
to
make
their
own
notes
during
the
conference.
My
students
assured
me
that
this
combination
later
facilitated
their
revision
processes.
In
peeling
away
the
layers
of
my
time
as
a
WA,
I
realize
that
the
composition
of
my
class
greatly
influenced
the
overall
experience.
In
particular,
several
students
in
the
class
were
international
students,
and
thus
spoke
English
as
a
second
or
even
third
language.
Nevertheless,
they
were
some
of
the
most
dedicated
writers.
I
wondered
whether
their
consistent
devotion
was
mere
coincidence
or
a
result
of
cultural
background.
Though
the
answer
to
this
question
still
eludes
me,
I
was
continuously
pleased
by
the
efforts
the
students
made
to
improve
their
work.
They
came
to
conferences
prepared
with
myriad
questions,
and
together
we
worked
through
some
of
the
finer
points
of
the
English
language.
Overall,
and
remarkably,
these
students
were
far
better
writers
than
some
of
their
American
peers.
They
wrote
eloquent,
complex
sentences
that
not
only
returned
to,
but
also
developed,
their
thesis.
Conversations
with
the
professor
assured
me
that
their
grades
duly
reflected
their
talent
and
hard
work.
Perhaps
the
international
students
understood
the
writing
process
so
well
because
their
academic
success
depended
on
their
ability
to
effectively
communicate
with
people
who
may
not
speak
the
same
first
language.
Regardless
of
whether
they
yet
realize
the
paramount
importance
of
this
ability,
I
reflect
on
my
encounters
with
these
students
and
understand
how
greatly
this
expertise
will
impact
their
success
in
an
English
speaking
world.
Interacting
with
my
fellow
WAOs
and
students
was
one
of
the
best
and
most
interesting
aspects
of
my
experience
last
year.
I
learned
from
each
of
them
and
truly
enjoyed
our
time
together.
One
of
the
most
fulfilling
encounters
I
had
last
spring
occurred
when
two
of
my
former
students
approached
me
and
asked
if
I
could
help
them
with
a
paper.
They
knew
that
I
was
not
technically
a
WA
last
semester,
but
they
still
trusted
my
knowledge
as
a
student
writer.
Their
confidence
in
me
was
humbling.
It
was
rewarding
to
know
that
my
efforts
were
both
useful
and
appreciated,
and
I
look
forward
to
future
experiences
that
reaffirm
that
reward.
Also
last
spring,
I
had
an
important
opportunity
to
reevaluate
my
work
with
the
College
Writing
Program
through
a
different
lens.
While
enrolled
in
my
Values
in
Science
and
Technologies
(VaST)
class
we
were
assigned
a
Writing
Associate,
and
I
was
again
under
the
auspices
of
the
Program,
this
time
as
student
rather
than
teacher.
This
role
reversal
allowed
me
to
improve
my
skills
as
a
student
and
a
future
WA.
Reflecting
upon
the
most
effective
conferences
from
the
fall,
I
drew
from
past
conferences
to
tailor
the
WA
meetings
for
this
course.
I
came
to
meetings
with
specific
questions,
better
understood
the
boundaries
of
the
WA/student
relationship,
and
was
better
able
to
utilize
my
WA
as
a
resource.
Before
each
conference,
I
reread
my
own
work
so
that
I
could
better
explain
my
ideas
to
my
WA.
As
a
result,
our
time
together
was
more
efficient
and
effective.
So
too,
last
spring's
round
of
WA
meetings
reaffirmed
the
importance
of
working
with
a
WA
who
puts
faithful
time
and
energy
into
students'
papers.
I
appreciated
the
time
my
WA
spent
with
me
not
only
during
our
twenty-minute
conference,
but
also
that
she
had
made
an
effort
to
improve
my
essay
prior
to
our
meeting.
I
recommitted
myself
to
do
the
same
as
a
returning
member
of
the
CWP
staff.
Beyond
my
work
involved
with
the
CWP,
I
had
several
other
experiences
over
the
past
year
that
shaped
me
as
a
student
writer.
Last
fall
I
enrolled
in
English
350:
Studies
in
Writing
and
Rhetoric,
the
Politics
of
Literacy.
Our
semester
project
entailed
the
creation
of
a
more
detailed
Literacy
Narrative.
Working
from
last
summer's
initial
piece
of
WA
writing,
I
began
to
explore
other
areas
of
my
writing
and
myself.
Our
class
learned
that
literacy
is
more
than
the
ability
to
read
and
write
and
that
it
is
a
tool
people
from
every
culture
use
to
discover
and
shape
their
own
identities.
From
Richard
Rodriguez,
to
Villanueva,
to
Frederick
Douglass,
we
studied
writers
from
a
variety
of
backgrounds,
time
periods,
and
social
contexts,
each
of
whom
crafted
his
own
literacy
history
for
the
world
to
read.
In
turn,
I
drew
from
their
insights
and
rewrote
an
expanded
version
of
my
own
history,
including
sections
on
public
writing
and
speaking,
the
implications
of
technological
advancement
on
writing,
and
the
role
of
writing
and
identity.
By
the
end
of
the
semester
I
was
proud
of
the
work
I
had
done,
but
still
knew
there
was
an
infinite
amount
to
explore.
I
continue
this
exploration
through
this
assignment
and
look
forward
to
doing
so
again
next
summer
as
well.
In
connection
with
English
350,
my
class
participated
in
the
ProJeCt
of
Easton,
a
literacy
program
for
students
of
all
ages
wishing
to
acquire
a
better
knowledge
and
understanding
of
the
English
language.
I
worked
with
an
adult
class
of
ESL
students
on
Monday
nights
and
led
discussions
on
a
range
of
topics
including
geography,
weather,
travel
plans,
and
personal
backgrounds.
The
stories
each
student
shared
were
amazing
and
truly
gave
me
new
perspectives
on
reading,
writing,
and
culture.
Several
students
escaped
from
Vietnam
during
the
war
in
the
1970Os.
One
student
recounted
his
recent
escape
from
politically
oppressed
Sudan
and
his
hiding
in
Egypt
until
he
could
safely
travel
to
the
United
States
with
his
family.
Yet
another
student
left
his
family
and
entire
past
in
Argentina
in
search
of
the
better
life
America
promised
to
provide;
a
return
to
his
country
is
now
impossible.
These
stories
comprise
only
a
handful
from
the
group,
and
that
group
is
merely
a
handful
among
a
much
larger
population
across
the
country
and
around
the
globe,
who
come
to
the
United
States
and
want
to
learn
English.
They
see
the
acquisition
of
reading
and
writing
English
as
pivotal
to
their
ability
to
live
comfortably,
happily,
and
peacefully.
The
skills
we
consider
second
nature
are
the
very
skills
these
individuals
are
trying
desperately
to
obtain.
I
worked
with
them
on
their
conversation
skills
as
well
as
their
writing.
It
was
interesting
to
compare
working
with
adult
ESL
students
to
working
with
Lafayette
ESL
students.
Though
from
diverse
backgrounds
and
of
many
different
ages,
in
each
case
the
individuals
in
the
ESL
group
were
more
dedicated
and
interested
in
improving
their
work.
Most
importantly,
they
better
appreciated
the
value
of
literacy
in
the
United
States.
Also
through
ProJeCt,
I
spent
my
Tuesday
mornings
working
with
the
Day
Care
Center.
Many
of
the
children
in
this
class
also
had
parents
enrolled
in
my
Monday
evening
course,
and
I
observed
differences
and
similarities
in
learning
styles,
personalities,
and
abilities.
While
tackling
a
second
language
at
such
a
young
age
is
a
daunting
task,
their
ability
to
learn
this
language
will
inevitably
be
a
multi-faceted
gift.
By
enrolling
their
children
in
a
literacy
program
such
as
the
ProJeCt
of
Easton,
these
parents
are
handing
their
kids
the
tools
to
build
solid
and
successful
futures.
Not
only
will
they
master
the
English
language,
but
they
will
also
still
be
able
to
communicate
with
their
native
speakers.
This
already
elevates
them
a
tier
above
their
parents
and
many
citizens
of
the
United
States.
Beyond
English
350,
my
other
Lafayette
courses
impacted
my
development
as
a
writer
this
year.
While
not
science-oriented,
I
refined
skills
in
my
VaST
that
I
had
not
focused
on
since
high
school.
I
was
introduced
to
a
direct,
objective,
more
scientifically
based
style
of
writing,
and
I
was
forced
to
relearn
the
art
of
paraphrasing.
Additionally,
I
took
a
Constitutional
History
class
that
was
an
excellent
learning
experience.
Searching
documents
for
case
precedent
and
applying
legal
standards
to
different
levels
of
judicial
review
became
important
blueprints
for
my
summer
work.
As
a
paralegal
for
a
Massachusetts
law
firm,
knowing
how
to
read
a
case
and
highlight
the
important
and
relevant
information
has
greatly
facilitated
my
internship.
The
course
also
provided
me
with
the
basic
research
skills
necessary
for
successful
Lexis
Nexis
navigation,
which
has
again
been
important
to
my
daily
work
this
summer.
The
Internet
is
an
invaluable
tool
in
todayOs
technologically
advanced
world,
but
without
proper
training,
it
is
easy
to
become
overwhelmed
by
its
breadth.
Fortunately
my
experience
at
Lafayette
prepared
me
well
for
this
aspect
of
my
employment.
Finally,
last
winter
I
had
the
incredible
opportunity
to
study
abroad
on
the
Lafayette
interim
trip
to
London.
While
in
Europe,
we
studied
theatre
and
the
art
of
writing
reviews,
neither
of
which
I
had
previously
studied.
Though
I
did
not
master
either
area
in
our
three-week
course,
I
truly
appreciated
the
extensive
knowledge
I
gained.
To
read
a
piece
of
literature,
see
that
piece
come
to
life
in
a
theatre
production,
discuss
it
with
my
peers
and
then
write
about
it
on
my
own,
all
in
the
midst
of
a
foreign
culture
and
country,
was
truly
an
amazing
experience.
Travel
inevitably
shapes
us
in
many
ways.
This
writing
intensive
class
in
combination
with
my
travel
experience
certainly
shaped
my
development
as
a
writer.
Studying
in
a
different
country
provides
a
unique
opportunity
for
intellectual
stimulation
and
growth
that
vacationing
in
that
same
country
often
does
not.
To
be
pessimistic,
my
college
career
is
now
half
over.
Initially
that
thought
was
intimidating,
for
I
am
not
nearly
ready
to
embark
on
the
next
great
chapter
of
my
life.
Fortunately
I
prefer
to
be
optimistic,
and
I
am
ready
for
the
next
page.
I
look
forward
to
my
junior
year
with
the
same
enthusiasm
and
anticipation
I
do
every
year.
Excited
to
continue
my
development
as
a
WA,
a
writer,
a
student,
and
a
person,
I
have
no
doubt
that
my
expectations
will
once
again
be
greatly
surpassed
in
the
upcoming
year.
Still,
I
cannot
begin
to
guess
in
what
ways
or
fashions
they
will
do
so.
I
can
only
hope
that
the
upcoming
year
will
be
as
rich
with
opportunity
for
growth
as
was
the
last,
and
that
I
always
embrace
each
new
opportunity
with
enthusiasm.
