Literacy

August
2008
My
experiences
during
the
past
year
have
had
a
tremendous
impact
on
who
I
am
as
a
writer.
I
spent
the
spring
semester
abroad
in
Seville,
Spain,
studying
in
a
language
intensive
program.
That
was
by
far
one
of
the
best
experiences
of
my
life.
All
of
my
classes
were
taught
in
Spanish
and
I
lived
with
a
host
family
that
did
not
speak
English.
As
a
result
of
being
immersed
in
that
environment,
my
ability
to
communicate
in
Spanish
improved
drastically
over
the
course
of
four
months.
That
not
only
signifies
an
improved
ability
to
speak
Spanish,
but
to
write
as
well.
In
the
past
writing
in
Spanish
was
very
difficult
for
me.
The
most
difficult
writing
task
I
have
ever
undertaken
was
an
essay
for
a
Spanish
class
at
Lafayette
during
my
sophomore
year.
It
was
an
analytical
essay
about
the
play
La
Casa
de
Bernarda
Alba.
The
reason
that
it
was
so
difficult
was
because
my
Spanish
ability
was
such
that
it
was
a
horribly
slow
process
translating
my
words
and
sentences
into
Spanish
and
it
was
very
easy
to
lose
points
and
ideas
in
translation.
In
my
time
abroad
I
had
numerous
writing
assignments
in
Spanish;
however,
since
my
Spanish
ability
was
improving,
the
problems
I
encountered
in
writing
in
another
language
were
far
less
severe
and
it
became
much
easier
and
natural
to
write
in
Spanish.
This
step
was
a
significant
benchmark
in
my
history
as
a
writer;
however
it
occurred
over
the
course
of
the
semester
and
there
were
many
writing
experiences
that
contributed
to
reaching
it.
An
interesting
experience
during
my
time
in
Seville
was
the
different
expectations
that
my
professors
had
of
me
when
it
came
to
writing.
In
regards
to
the
quality
of
the
writing
I
felt
as
if
the
expectations
were
lower
of
the
students.
The
professors
seemed
to
place
more
of
an
emphasis
on
the
length
of
the
product
and
were
content
if
the
students
could
write
in
coherent
Spanish
for
the
number
of
pages
required.
The
actual
writing
itself
was
not
critiqued
strongly.
This
was
likely
because
the
professors
had
a
different
goal
in
mind
for
the
students;
they
just
wanted
us
to
practice
writing
in
Spanish.
Essentially
there
was
a
change
in
the
order
of
concerns
that
I
learned
as
a
WA.
Elements
such
as
the
thesis
and
supporting
evidence
became
lower
order
concerns.
The
change
in
the
order
of
concerns
was
difficult
to
deal
with
initially.
Towards
the
end
of
the
semester
in
Seville
I
had
papers
due
for
three
different
classes
on
the
same
day,
all
of
which
were
similar
assignments
and
all
of
which
required
me
to
shift
my
order
of
concerns.
Two
of
the
classes
were
Spanish
history
classes
while
the
other
was
a
current
events
course
and
each
assignment
was
to
choose
a
topic
that
was
relevant
to
the
course
material
and
write
about
it.
I
did
not
have
to
form
a
thesis
for
any
of
the
papers
or
prove
anything.
I
could
simply
paraphrase
the
entirety
of
each
essay.
Assignments
like
those
were
confusing
to
me
at
first
since
they
were
different
from
anything
I
can
remember
having
written,
especially
at
the
college
level.
The
difficulty
in
those
assignments
was
removing
my
mindset
from
the
WA
thinking.
I
had
to
treat
the
papers
as
a
different
kind
of
writing.
IOll
call
this
category
of
writing
foreign
language
practice.
This
type
of
writing
not
only
forced
me
to
change
my
order
of
concerns,
it
caused
me
to
adopt
a
modified
writing
process
as
well.
I
did
not
really
do
any
prewriting
for
the
three
essays;
I
simply
chose
topics,
did
some
simple
research,
and
began
writing,
paraphrasing
the
information
I
had
gathered.
That
was
all
that
was
necessary
to
complete
the
assignments.
Minimal
revision
was
required
as
well,
so
ultimately
it
was
a
fairly
simple
writing
process.
It
felt
like
I
was
breaking
the
rules
and
doing
something
wrong
because
the
assignments
just
felt
too
simple.
Consequently
I
ended
up
inadvertently
forming
theses,
although
weak
ones
at
that,
for
two
of
the
three
essays,
since
that
is
where
my
writing
naturally
took
me,
as
I
found
it
too
difficult
to
remove
myself
from
the
WA
mindset.
Ultimately,
those
writing
experiences
in
Seville
were
rewarding.
Although
not
satisfied
with
my
own
writing
efforts,
I
accomplished
the
goals
that
the
professors
had
in
mind.
I
conducted
research
in
Spanish,
had
some
good
practice
writing
in
Spanish
and
at
the
same
time
learned
something
about
Spain
and
its
history.
These
experiences
were
interesting
to
me
because
they
made
me
realize
that
sometimes
the
goal
of
a
writing
assignment
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
quality
of
the
writing.
In
certain
circumstances
there
are
more
important
objectives
in
mind.
In
my
experience,
in
the
end
I
left
as
a
much
improved
writer
in
Spanish
and
with
a
better
understanding
of
the
history
and
culture
of
Spain,
which
were
some
of
the
main
objectives
of
the
professors
and
of
the
institution
in
which
I
studied.
My
writing
experiences
in
Seville
make
me
think
back
to
the
fall
semester
last
year,
my
first
semester
as
a
WA.
The
confusion
that
I
faced
when
presented
with
the
three
aforementioned
writing
assignments
now
allows
me
to
better
relate
to
some
of
the
writers
that
I
worked
with
as
a
WA
for
an
Engineering
Professionalism
and
Ethics
class.
During
conferences
writers
frequently
came
to
me
with
questions
about
the
assignments.
Many
times
the
writers
found
the
assignments
unclear
and
were
confused
about
what
the
professor
was
looking
for.
In
particular,
the
first
assignment
presented
the
most
problem
for
the
writers.
The
first
assignment
was
an
exercise
in
technical
writing.
The
writers
had
to
choose
something
that
they
were
an
NexpertO
at
and
describe
how
to
do
it
in
detail
using
technical
writing.
Many
of
the
writers
were
confused
by
the
assignment
and
did
not
know
what
the
professor
was
expecting
from
them.
I,
on
the
other
hand,
knew
exactly
what
the
professorOs
goal
was
for
the
students
because,
as
the
WA,
I
previously
had
a
meeting
with
the
professor
in
which
he
explained
the
assignment
and
his
expectations.
Because
of
that
I
did
not
necessarily
understand
the
writersO
confusion
with
the
assignment,
but
I
was
able
to
help
them
and
clarify
things.
However,
after
having
a
similar
experience
myself
with
multiple
assignments
while
in
Seville,
I
have
a
better
understanding
of
where
the
writers
were
coming
from.
In
most
instances
the
writers
who
were
confused
about
the
assignment
were
over-thinking
it
and
did
not
realize
that
the
professor
simply
wanted
them
to
practice
technical
writing.
This
was
similar
to
my
previously
mentioned
situation
in
Seville
where
I
did
not
realize
that
my
professors
simply
wanted
me
to
practice
writing
in
Spanish.
I
feel
that
this
experience
will
allow
me
to
better
perform
my
duties
as
a
WA
this
upcoming
fall.
I
think
that
it
will
remind
me
to
try
to
put
myself
in
the
shoes
of
the
writers
and
act
as
their
peer
in
the
conferences
as
opposed
to
their
WA.
I
think
that
one
of
the
toughest
challenges
facing
WAs
is
the
learning
to
not
take
an
authority
role
and
to
act
as
a
peer
to
the
writers
during
conferences.
It
is
easy
to
fall
into
an
authority
role
because
in
my
experience
writers
would
often
ask
me
for
answers
and
immediately
treat
me
as
the
authority
on
writing
without
me
trying
to
assume
that
position.
The
writers
would
look
at
me
as
the
WA
instead
of
as
their
peer.
This
makes
it
more
difficult
to
hold
effective
writing
conferences
the
way
that
we
want
to
as
WAs.
However,
this
is
something
that
I
made
an
effort
to
improve
upon
during
the
fall
semester
last
year
and
I
think
that
my
conferences
at
the
end
were
the
most
successful
in
part
because
of
the
environment
of
equality
that
I
created
with
the
writers.
For
new
WAs
I
think
that
creating
an
environment
such
as
that
is
very
important
for
being
an
effective
WA.
If
the
writers
view
you
as
a
peer
and
an
equal
they
will
feel
more
comfortable
during
conferences.
This
will
help
them
to
dictate
where
the
conference
goes
and
focus
on
working
together
to
improve
their
writing
as
opposed
to
simply
seeking
answers
from
the
WA.
This
is
important
to
holding
an
effective
writing
conference,
because
if
the
WA
simply
tells
a
writer
how
to
improve
their
essay
then
the
writer
will
achieve
only
immediate
help
but
will
not
benefit
in
the
long
run,
which
is
the
goal
of
the
College
Writing
Program.
I
feel
as
though
I
am
far
better
prepared
now
to
be
an
effective
WA
than
I
was
a
year
ago
at
this
time,
just
about
to
become
a
WA
for
the
first
time.
During
the
fall
semester
as
a
WA
and
the
spring
semester
abroad
I
had
valuable
experiences
that
I
have
learned
from.
That
knowledge
will
stay
with
me
this
year
and
I
am
looking
forward
to
applying
it.
This
next
year
I
have
to
take
numerous
writing
intensive
courses,
which
will
be
a
change
for
me,
but
I
think
that
my
experience
as
a
WA
will
benefit
me
and
I
welcome
the
change.
I
definitely
have
a
positive
outlook
for
the
upcoming
year
both
as
a
WA
and
a
writer.
