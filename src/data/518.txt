Writing
as
a
WA
D
Project
for
Workshop
My
Continued
Writing
History:
The
Past
Year
2005-2006
I
began
my
first
year
as
a
WA
fresh
off
the
high
of
an
amazing
English
class
experience
and
a
lot
of
encouragement
from
fellow
classmates
to
become
involved
with
the
writing
program
at
Lafayette.
I
approached
the
assignment
in
much
the
way
that
adolescents
approach
something
that
they
know
little
about:
I
convinced
myself
that
it
would
be
something
that
I
could
just
take
in
strideE
The
class
I
was
assigned
to,
much
to
my
surprise,
was
a
300
level
math
course.
I
have
to
admit
that
my
first
instinct
was
to
feel
intimidated.
I
knew
I
would
be
working
with
students
who
were
older
than
me,
and
subject
material
that
I
perceived
to
be
complex.
Still,
as
it
turned
out,
I
couldnOt
have
asked
for
a
better
first
assignment.
In
working
with
older
students,
I
was
able
to
rely
upon
much
of
the
teaching
of
past
WAs
who
had
already
laid
the
basic
foundation
for
writing
knowledge.
Students
came
in
throwing
around
WA
terminology
D
in
acronym
form
D
which
I
was
just
becoming
acquainted
with.
One
student
wrote
out
questions
each
time
before
she
came
to
one
of
our
meetings.
With
others,
I
sometimes
struggled
with
comments
to
make
because
the
papers
were
so
well
written.
Still,
problems
arose
both
with
expert
writers
and
their
counterparts
on
the
other
side
of
the
writing
skill
spectrum.
Some
students
struggled
with
basic
grammar.
Others
had
trouble
focusing
their
papers
to
a
single
thesis
statement,
a
feature
of
research
pieces
that
the
professor
emphasized.
So
often,
I
felt
that
the
students
prepared
their
papers
just
to
submit
a
basic
rough
draft
for
points,
without
giving
a
care
as
to
the
quality
of
writing
I
would
see
or
have
to
comment
on.
It
was
frustrating
when
I
would
read
a
paper
that
had
large
pieces
missing
from
it;
I
felt
like
my
time
was
being
wasted.
Also
frustrating
were
the
times
when
students
would
miss
appointments.
Despite
this,
the
writing
conferences
took
on
a
formulaic
style
that
I
became
accustomed
to.
I
still
donOt
think
I
experienced
any
conference
longer
than
20
minutes.
I
almost
felt
that
the
nature
of
the
assignments
didnOt
lend
themselves
to
long
conferences.
The
first
assignment
was
a
bibliography,
the
second
was
a
research
paper
on
the
Inca
quipus,
and
the
third
was
a
longer
research
paper
on
an
in
depth
mathematical
concept.
All
but
the
third
paper
seemed
to
require
minimal
conferencing
unless
the
papers
were
extremely
unorganized.
In
addition,
the
students
were
all
fairly
accomplished
writers,
on
their
third
or
fourth
writing
course
at
Lafayette.
Although
somewhat
challenging
to
understand,
it
was
always
interesting
to
see
how
students
incorporated
mathematics
directly
into
their
papers.
This
was
another
characteristic
that
the
professor
liked
to
see
in
each
paper.
A
lot
of
the
students
chose
to
include
diagrams
that
they
had
made
themselves
as
well
as
pictures,
which
proved
to
be
an
interesting
subject
during
conferences.
I
had
never
tried
to
include
these
features
in
my
own
writing,
and
it
had
been
a
subject
in
the
OWriting
GenresO
English
class
I
had
taken
the
previous
semester.
It
turned
out
to
be
a
little
bit
of
a
challenge
to
include,
and
then
reference,
in
the
papers.
Still,
it
helped
lengthen
the
already
short
conferences!
In
interactions
with
the
professor,
he
was
always
enthusiastic
about
the
WA
program
as
well
as
involving
his
students
in
it.
I
met
with
him
at
first,
then
contacted
him
via
email
about
paper
schedules
and
pickup.
He
always
provided
me
with
an
assignment
sheet
for
each
paper,
and
the
paper
exchange
and
signup
sheet
process
always
went
smoothly.
However,
because
he
also
read
the
papers
for
math
content,
where
I
focused
specifically
on
the
writing
itself,
I
felt
that
the
students
were
more
prone
to
listen
to
his
advice
and
weigh
it
above
mine.
What
became
frustrating
for
the
students
was
that
he
would
assign
a
number
grade
to
a
paper
with
only
a
comment
like
NNice
Job!O
They
were
given
no
feedback
about
how
to
improve
their
papers.
They
were
also
shown
no
grading
rubric
by
which
the
numbers
were
assigned.
On
the
assignment
sheets
themselves
the
professor
would
list
characteristics
that
he
was
looking
for
in
the
paper,
both
concerning
writing
and
content,
which
were
the
only
limits
given
to
students
by
which
to
write.
A
lot
of
them
would
come
in
confused
about
the
grade,
and
sometimes
I
felt
they
would
blame
me
for
the
grade.
Concerning
writing,
what
challenged
me
most
with
my
assignment
was
on
what
level
to
interact
with
the
studentsO
papers,
and
how
to
engage
them
with
their
papers
during
our
conferences.
A
lot
of
the
students
didnOt
want
to
conference
about
their
papers;
they
conveyed
to
me
on
numerous
occasions
how
they
felt
it
was
a
waste
of
time,
especially
for
the
course.
For
the
first
set
of
conferences,
I
scheduled
in
30
minutes
per
student,
and
ended
up
spending
around
5
or
10
minutes
with
each.
Even
those
5
or
10
minutes
appeared
too
long
for
some
of
the
students
to
spend
with
me;
theyOd
constantly
look
at
their
watch,
or
leave
their
cell
phone
out
on
the
table
with
the
clock
on
while
we
talked.
From
that
first
round
of
conferences
I
could
tell
that
a
lot
of
the
students
didnOt
feel
like
having
a
WA
for
this
course
was
worthwhile.
It
seemed
almost
as
though
the
students
would
just
have
rather
had
me
make
comments
directly
on
the
paper
for
them
to
read
later.
They
were
looking
for
a
faceless
editor,
instead
of
someone
that
they
would
have
to
talk
to.
Essentially,
this
is
one
area
where
I
hope
to
improve
my
strength
both
as
a
WA
and
a
writer
in
the
coming
year.
By
creating
a
stronger
conference
presence,
I
think
commenting
less
on
the
papers
and
just
making
marks
to
remind
about
what
to
talk
about
will
facilitate
dialog.
The
conferences
themselves
were
also
a
bit
of
a
personal
challenge.
I
would
characterize
myself
as
a
shyer
person,
though
I
still
love
to
interact
with
people.
My
participation
in
the
WA
program
thrust
me
into
an
authority
position
from
the
beginning,
and
I
struggled
with
how
to
use
that
authority
and
approach
the
conferences.
In
the
beginning
I
have
to
say
I
was
more
standoffish.
I
smiled
a
lot
and
spoke
more
softly.
What
I
began
to
notice
was
that
the
students
didnOt
respond
well
to
this.
They
wouldnOt
engage
themselves
in
the
conference,
and
I
could
tell
just
from
body
language
that
they
would
have
much
rather
been
somewhere
else.
As
I
gained
more
confidence
and
spoke
with
more
authority,
the
students
began
to
respond.
I
would
joke
with
them
and
converse
about
subjects
outside
of
the
realm
of
the
paper.
I
would
ask
them
about
the
class.
By
making
the
conference
more
informal,
I
found
that
they
were
a
lot
more
willing
to
talk
about
their
writing.
A
lot
of
the
students,
especially
in
the
beginning,
seemed
to
almost
take
it
personally
when
I
would
comment
negatively
on
an
aspect
of
their
papers,
even
when
I
put
it
as
gently
as
possible.
By
establishing
a
relationship
with
them,
I
also
noticed
that
they
tended
to
get
less
flustered
when
I
made
a
comment
about
something
that
needed
to
be
changed
or
an
aspect
that
I
didnOt
feel
worked
particularly
well.
Over
the
course
of
the
semester,
I
donOt
think
I
saw
writing
styles
change
as
much
as
I
witnessed
the
students
beginning
to
take
their
writing
and
the
conferences
themselves
more
seriously.
Their
drafts
became
better
prepared,
and
the
conferences
lasted
longer
each
time.
When
I
offered
to
meet
with
students
beyond
the
required
one
time
for
the
last
paper,
the
majority
of
students
signed
up
for
a
second
conference.
From
a
group
that
had
been
so
reluctant
to
conference
at
the
beginning
of
the
semester,
they
finally
made
me
feel
like
I
was
actually
doing
my
job.
Outside
of
my
work
for
the
class,
where
I
felt
I
most
began
to
develop
my
writing
identity
was
in
my
interactions
with
students
that
brought
in
papers
for
drop-in
hours.
These
students
were
always
ready
to
participate
in
a
writing
conference
the
way
that
I
had
envisioned
them
to
be.
Quite
a
few
of
them
actually
led
the
conferences,
which
was
quite
a
change
from
the
passivity
of
the
students
in
my
assigned
class.
In
one
particular
instance
I
remember
conferencing
with
a
student
for
an
hour
and
a
half
about
his
piece.
He
had
brought
the
book
D
the
graphic
novel
by
Art
Spiegelman
D
with
him
to
the
conference,
so
as
we
went
over
parts
of
his
essay
where
he
had
written
about
specific
panels,
we
were
able
to
flip
through
the
book
and
find
them.
The
student
did
not
speak
English
as
a
first
language,
and
it
was
clear
that
he
was
struggling
to
express
what
he
wanted
to
say
about
the
book.
It
was
a
little
painful
for
me
at
first
to
try
to
help
him,
as
I
was
trying
to
understand
what
he
meant
as
well.
Together
we
managed
to
both
clean
up
his
essay
grammatically
as
well
as
to
focus
his
ideas
and
generate
further
thoughts
for
him
to
expand
on.
The
conference
itself
put
me
completely
on
the
spot
D
I
had
never
seen
the
book
before,
though
I
had
heard
about
it
from
other
WAs.
It
was
so
rewarding
to
see
the
smile
on
the
studentOs
face
when
he
left
the
room.
What
brought
my
writing
history
in
greater
focus
was
when
the
roles
reversed
and
I
found
myself
acting
as
both
a
WA
and
a
writing
student.
Last
semester
I
was
abroad
and
taking
an
Engineering
Ethics
course
that
required
three
longer
papers.
As
part
of
the
course,
our
professor,
since
we
were
abroad
and
without
a
WA,
required
peer
reviews
of
the
papers
before
we
submitted
them
for
grading.
It
put
my
WA
experience
in
perspective
to
be
given
advice
about
my
own
writing.
I
found
myself
emulating
a
lot
of
the
students
with
regards
to
receiving
criticism
D
it
was
hard
not
to
take
it
personally!
D
but
I
also
found
that
my
writing
skills,
especially
with
regards
to
research
papers,
were
far
more
honed
than
they
had
been
the
previous
semester.
I
also
found
that
my
voice
was
much
stronger
and
more
pronounced
in
my
papers.
When
reading
back
through
my
own
papers,
IOd
find
myself
making
the
same
comments
that
I
had
made
to
my
previous
WA
students,
looking
for
transitions,
developing
a
strong
thesis
statement,
and
ensuring
that
my
evidence
supported
the
points
I
would
put
forth
in
my
papers.
Another
interesting
thing
that
I
noticed
was
how
other
students
reacted
when
they
heard
that
I
had
been
a
WA.
Other
students
outside
of
the
few
I
was
required
to
exchange
papers
with
in
peer
review
asked
me
for
help,
and
to
read
their
papers
and
comment.
This
is
how
students
regard
the
strength
of
the
writing
program
at
Lafayette,
and
students
who
choose
to
involve
themselves
in
it.
It
was
so
encouraging
to
see
that
students
were
seeking
out
a
WA
even
when
there
wasnOt
one
required.
The
same
happened
to
another
past
WA
who
was
in
the
class.
In
my
coming
semester,
I
hope
to
better
utilize
the
resources
that
the
WA
program
has
to
offer,
mainly
the
WAs
themselves,
during
the
weekly
staff
meetings.
Last
semester
I
listened
a
lot
of
the
time,
instead
of
contributing.
ThatOs
something
IOd
personally
like
to
change,
both
to
secure
help
for
myself
and
assist
others.
What
I
observed
in
the
WA
room
was
a
unique
relationship
between
so
many
of
the
students.
It
was
a
common
bond
that
we
shared
when
we
were
in
that
room.
There
was
so
much
encouragement
from
the
professors
involved
as
well
as
the
WAs
themselves.
I
hope,
with
my
WA
experience
in
the
fall,
to
continue
to
develop
my
history
as
a
writer
and
to
expand
not
only
my
writing
skills,
but
also
my
conferencing
skills.
Over
the
summer
IOll
be
traveling
to
Africa
to
continue
wetlands
research
for
the
Civil
Engineering
department,
and
IOve
already
made
it
a
goal
to
journal
every
day.
Although
I
wonOt
be
taking
a
writing
course
myself
in
the
fall,
IOm
hoping
to
continue
my
journaling
so
I
can
improve
my
own
writing
skills,
which
will
in
turn
influence
my
skills
as
a
WA.
I
am
looking
forward
to
a
new
assignment,
a
new
set
of
challenges,
and
a
continued
experience
as
one
of
LafayetteOs
writing
associates.
