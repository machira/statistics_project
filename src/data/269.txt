Writing
Associate
Summer
Assignment
2000
Date
Due:
August
18,
2000
As
I
begin
my
literary
narrative
this
summer,
I
am
faced
with
the
same
problem
that
I
usually
encounter
when
I
settle
down
for
a
project,
where
to
begin.
Whether
I
am
tackling
a
problem
set,
starting
a
new
experiment,
or
just
preparing
to
begin
a
new
day,
the
hardest
part
for
me
is
the
beginning.
Without
reflection,
I
realize
this
part
of
my
writing
and
attitude
has
not
changed
over
the
past
year.
However,
I
also
know
many
aspects
of
my
life
and
my
writing
have
developed
since
my
last
self-evaluation.
Obliviously
my
history
as
writer,
both
through
the
experiences
that
I
have
had
through
the
Writing
Associate
Program
and
writing
elsewhere
in
my
life,
have
had
an
impact.
While
struggling
to
focus
my
assignment,
I
observe
my
surroundings.
In
order
to
make
the
best
of
my
time,
I
have
headed
to
Borders.
I
begin
my
journey
of
introspection
surrounded
by
individuals
paging
through
magazines,
typing
on
lab
tops,
and
consuming
sweets
and
caffeine.
In
contrast
to
last
year
where
I
composed
much
of
my
assignment
while
on
the
night
shift
at
a
construction
site,
the
intellectual
atmosphere
I
selected
reflects
a
shift
that
has
occurred
in
my
life.
During
this
past
year,
I
have
gained
a
deeper
appreciation
of
learning.
I
feel
that
this
shift
is
apparent
not
only
in
my
style
of
writing,
but
also
in
the
topics
that
I
write.
Unfortunately,
I
am
having
a
difficult
time
focusing
on
my
introspection.
I
can
not
determine
if
this
difficulty
stems
from
my
lack
of
writing
over
the
past
three
months
or
the
three
cups
of
coffee
that
I
have
consumed.
After
switching
to
decaf,
I
decide
to
start
at
the
beginning
-
August
1999.
Last
year
when
I
sat
down
to
write
my
narrative;
I
vividly
remember
my
fear
that
the
quality
of
my
paper
would
be
inadequate
for
that
of
a
Writing
Associate.
I
remember
feeling
that
my
self-history
was
boring
and
filled
with
grammatical
errors.
As
I
sit
down
this
year,
I
still
possess
the
same
feelings
of
inadequacies.
I
feel
that
my
writing
style
is
extremely
juvenile
for
someone
of
my
position
and
I
also
believe
that
many
of
my
colleagues
would
laugh
after
reading
my
narrative.
These
feeling
of
insecurity
appeared
repeatedly
during
my
past
year
as
a
Writing
Associate.
Most
notably,
I
felt
uneasy
every
time
I
participated
in
grammar
exercises
at
staff
meetings.
The
rest
of
the
staff
seemed
to
effortlessly
determine
the
errors
and
improvements
in
the
passages
while
I
struggled
to
perform
at
the
same
level.
One
particular
experience
in
which
these
feelings
were
reinforced
was
the
infamous
Writing
Associate
Grammar
Quiz.
Although
I
did
spend
time
preparing
for
the
quiz,
I
still
was
very
unhappy
with
my
performance.
Part
of
the
reason
is
my
desire
for
perfection.
Therefore,
my
less
then
average
score
was
difficult
for
me
to
accept
and
caused
me
to
question
not
only
the
methods
I
used
to
review
papers
but
also
my
qualifications
as
a
Writing
Associate.
This
experience
made
me
feel
less
confident
in
my
ability.
Therefore,
I
feel
that
during
my
second
semester
I
treaded
lightly
on
issues
of
grammar
in
my
conferences
except
when
serious
problems
were
present.
I
also
took
the
approach
stating
to
the
students
that
my
grammar
was
not
my
strongest
quality
and
I
probably
missed
errors
in
their
writing.
This
approach
may
have
compromised
my
qualifications
in
the
view
of
some
students.
Overall,
I
feel
it
was
an
effective
approach.
However,
I
did
not
feel
that
my
performances
as
a
Writing
Associate
were
inadequate
in
all
aspects.
In
my
own
evaluation,
on
e
of
the
areas
in
which
I
experienced
the
greatest
improvement
was
in
my
ability
to
interact
with
professors.
The
two
professors
to
whom
I
was
assigned
were
as
different
as
day
and
night.
During
my
rookie
semester,
my
professor
was
the
typical
absent-minded
engineer
who
talked
in
circles
when
responding
to
a
question
without
realizing
his
tendency.
During
my
second
round,
the
class's
instructor
was
a
professor
with
whom
I
was
already
well
acquainted
my
advisor.
Her
approach
to
the
ethics
class
I
was
assigned
was
the
same
as
the
approach
she
used
in
the
other
classes
I
had
taken
with
her.
She
was
direct
and
well
defined,
an
ideal
professor
for
any
Writing
Associate.
Obliviously,
my
expectations
of
the
instructor
and
the
class
varied
between
the
two
sections.
Reflecting,
I
wonder
if
I
adequately
fulfilled
my
obligation
to
the
first
batch
of
individuals
I
was
assigned.
My
first
professor,
an
extremely
intelligent
and
nice
individual,
was
also
vague
with
the
students.
Therefore,
in
many
cases,
I
found
myself
attempting
to
help
them
solve
their
problems
with
only
broad
generalizations.
I
wonder
where
the
line
should
be
drawn
between
adding
to
my
own
personal
interpretations
of
the
assignment
and
taking
the
chance
of
misleading
these
individuals.
Due
to
my
own
uncertainties
regarding
the
advice
I
should
give
as
well
as
questions
regarding
the
assignments,
I
feel
that
I
expected
less
from
the
papers
of
the
first
group
assigned.
My
experience
as
a
Writing
Associate
was
filled
with
many
notable
encounters
on
a
personal
level.
Some
of
these
experiences
were
extremely
positive
while
others
were
challenging.
My
most
frustrating
experience
occurred
during
the
course
of
my
first
semester
as
a
Writing
Associate.
My
first
day
of
appointments
had
gone
smoothly
with
one
exception;
my
final
appointment
did
not
show.
After
waiting
fifteen
minutes,
half
of
the
appointment
time,
I
returned
to
my
room
exhausted
but
happy.
Unfortunately,
my
good
spirit
was
soon
doused
by
a
nasty
message
on
the
answering
machine.
My
final
appointment,
a
part-time
student
who
worked
full-time,
had
left
a
message
questioning
not
only
my
decision
not
to
wait
the
entire
appointment
time
for
him
but
also
the
need
for
my
position.
This
message
was
also
accompanied
by
an
email
to
both
myself
and
the
professor
of
the
course
that
stated,
most
notably,
that
his
boss
gave
him
twenty
minutes
of
flex.
Although
I
was
fortunate
that
the
professor
did
agree
with
my
decision,
my
troubles
were
far
from
over.
I
agreed
to
reschedule
our
appointment
for
seven
thirty
on
the
one
day
of
the
week
when
I
did
not
have
an
eight
o'clock
class,
the
gentleman
began
the
appointment
with
the
question,
"Do
I
have
to
meet
with
you
every
time
I
write
a
paper?"
Throughout
the
conference,
the
gentleman
acted
distracted,
disinterested,
and
condescending.
I
left
feeling
belittled
and
like
a
failure.
I
would
like
to
conclude
this
tale
by
telling
of
the
amazing
breakthrough
that
I
had
over
the
course
of
the
semester.
However,
this
is
not
the
case.
Before
the
next
conferences,
the
individual
cancelled
at
the
last
minute
and
left
a
number
where
he
could
be
reached.
His
office
voice
mail
always
answered.
After
days
of
phone
tag,
he
finally
returned
my
call
during
hours
when
I
said
I
would
not
be
in
class.
He
suggested
we
meet
at
seven
thirty
the
morning
the
paper
was
due.
I
pointed
out
there
would
not
be
any
time
for
revisions.
Finally,
I
stated
that,
in
my
opinion,
such
a
meeting
would
not
only
be
a
waste
of
my
time
but
also
a
waste
of
his
time.
Therefore,
we
never
again
met.
Although
the
course's
instructor
did
not
fault
my
attempts,
I
still
would
have
liked
the
opportunity
to
assist
the
individual.
If
I
was
again
presented
with
the
same
situation,
I
believe
that
I
would
handle
it
in
a
similar
manner.
Unfortunately,
I
feel
that
this
problem
was
more
one
of
attitude)
Some
students
may
not
feel
the
program
is
helpful
and
attend
conferences
either
because
they
are
required
or
out
of
courtesy.
However,
this
individual
was
not
influenced
by
the
fact
that
the
conference
was
required
by
the
instructor
and
also
lacked
common
courtesy.
Unfortunately,
after
my
first
year
as
Writing
Associate,
I
feel
that
some
students
do
not
want
my
help.
I
have
concluded
that,
in
my
opinion,
sometimes
the
Writing
Associate
must
accept
this
negative
attitude.
During
the
past
year,
I
also
had
many
rewarding
experiences
as
a
result
of
my
role
of
a
Writing
Associate.
The
highlight
of
my
experience
occurred
one
evening
in
the
spring
as
I
scurried
from
the
library.
Absorbed
in
my
world
of
engineering
formulas
and
constants,
I
turned
to
hear
someone
calling
my
name.
It
was
one
of
the
guys
from
the
class
I
was
assigned.
I
really
enjoyed
working
with
him.
The
conferences
were
always
effortless
and
a
dialogue
of
good
ideas
always
resulted.
He
seemed
to
value
my
insights;
however,
he
also
seemed
to
lack
confidence
in
his
own
ability.
The
young
man
ran
out
of
the
library
to
thank
me
for
all
of
my
help
with
his
last
paper
and
to
share
the
excitement
ol
his
good
grade.
I
found
his
enthusiasm
and
gratefulness
to
me
shocking
because
I
really
hadn't
done
anything.
The
conference
had
not
been
unusual
to
me,
but
to
him,
it
was
a
great
experience.
I
don't
take
credit
for
this;
sometimes
people
just
need
someone
to
give
them
a
bit
of
encouragement.
I
find
this
to
be
the
most
important
part
of
my
role
as
a
Writing
Associate,
to
determine
the
needs
of
each
individual.
Some
need
help
with
organization,
others
with
grammar.
Still
some,
such
as
the
student
in
this
example,
lack
confidence.
As
a
Writing
Associate,
the
largest
challenge
I
had
was
to
not
fall
into
a
cookie
cutter
approach
to
the
conferences.
To
me
cookie
cutter
means
conducting
twenty
conferences
almost
identical
in
content.
Instead,
I
tried
to
avoid
the
easier
road
and
attempted
to
evaluate
each
writer
individually.
My
first
year
as
a
Writing
Associate
was
one
of
learning
and
development.
I
learned
not
only
about
writing
styles
that
worked
for
others,
but
also
about
how
to
deal
with
individuals.
I
also
developed
my
confidence.
This
past
year
was
one
where
I
repeatedly
questioned
my
qualifications
and
knowledge
of
writing.
Two
experiences
outside
my
work
as
a
Writing
Associate
strongly
influenced
my
writing
over
the
past
year.
One
of
these
events
was
my
struggle
to
write
my
independent
study
proposal
for
my
economics
class
with
Professor
Beckman.
A
tough
wordsmith,
Professor
Beckman
continuously
had
me
revise
and
edit
my
paper.
Although
a
frustrating
task,
I
learned
many
things
about
my
writing
style.
I
realized
that
my
writing
style
had
become
extremely
technical
and
it
had
become
difficult
for
me
to
perform
other
types
of
writing.
A
personal
goal
of
mine
for
this
semester
is
to
develop
myself
in
both
types
of
writing.
Secondly,
I
realized
the
impact
that
outside
revisions
can
have.
Generally,
my
conferences
usually
only
last
half
an
hour
and
the
students
generally
seem
interested
in
what
is
necessary
for
a
good
grade.
On
a
higher
level,
when
the
motives
are
different,
I
realize
that
the
results
of
revision
can
be
so
much
greater.
The
second
experience
from
this
past
year
that
impacted
my
writing
style
was
the
journal
that
I
was
required
to
keep
during
my
interim
trip
to
China.
Prior
to
this
trip,
I
had
attempted
unsuccessfully
to
keep
journals
several
times
in
my
life.
However,
on
this
trip,
keeping
the
journal
was
essential
to
me
for
sorting
out
my
feelings,
insights,
and
confusions.
Writing
these
things
down
was
a
way
for
me
to
make
sense
of
these
different
circumstances
I
was
surrounded.
My
writing
in
these
journals
was
for
me.
It
was
free
writing,
I
wrote
down
the
thoughts
that
filled
my
head.
In
addition,
these
passages
are
very
interesting
for
me
to
read
in
retrospect
because
they
remind
me
of
experiences
that
have
become
less
clear
with
time.
However,
this
journal,
along
with
my
pictures,
brings
me
back
to
my
amazing
experiences
in
China.
Though
these
experience,
I
was
reminded
of
one
of
the
many
important
functions
of
writing,
to
remain
clear
as
memory
fades.
Finally,
being
asked
to
serve
as
a
mentor
for
the
Writing
Associate
program
has
also
had
an
impact
on
my
writing.
When
I
first
received
the
email,
I
was
extremely
surprised.
I
had
spent
the
entire
year
feeling
insecure
and
questioning
my
own
place
at
the
table
at
Writing
Associate
Staff
Meetings.
I
found
the
invitation
to
be
extremely
flattering
and
a
confidence
builder.
I
was
very
honored
to
know
that
not
only
did
Professor
Seetch
feel
that
I
was
capable
of
the
position,
but
my
peers
had
also
recommended
me.
I
am
a
big
fan
of
positive
reinforcement,
and
I
felt
this
invitation
to
strongly
encouraging.
As
I
conclude
my
review
of
this
past
year,
I
am
amazed
that
the
impact
that
my
role
as
a
Writing
Associate
and
my
own
attempts
at
compositions
has
had
on
my
writing.
However,
I
am
even
more
astonished
by
the
role
that
these
two
elements
have
played
in
my
own
development
as
a
person.
I
hope
this
next
year
yields
the
same
results.
