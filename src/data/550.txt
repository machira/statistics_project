Literacy
Narrative
I
can
hardly
remember
a
time
when
my
life
has
not
been
affected
by
books
and
writing.
Ever
since
I
was
a
small
child,
I
have
always
had
a
fascination
with
literature.
I
would
ask
my
parents
to
read
the
same
stories
over
and
over
to
me,
committing
the
stories
to
memory.
While
one
might
argue
that
literature
and
writing
are
not
the
same
thing,
in
my
mind
the
two
are
interconnected.
It
was
my
passion
for
books
that
inspired
me
to
start
writing,
and
it
is
always
my
love
of
literature
that
has
helped
me
further
hone
and
improve
my
writing.
My
memories
of
my
early
childhood
experiences
with
writing
and
literature
are
not
very
clear.
I
do
remember
how
excited
I
was
to
learn
how
to
read
and
write
in
kindergarten.
My
mother
tells
me
that
I
would
come
home
and
eagerly
tell
her
what
new
words
I
had
learned
or
what
new
stories
I
was
learning
to
read.
It
was
during
my
kindergarten
year
that
I
was
able
to
read
my
first
book
to
my
parents,
Giving
by
Shirley
Hughes.
Though
my
memories
are
vague
on
this
experience,
my
mother
told
me
that
I
apparently
took
the
book
out
for
her
to
read
to
me
one
night,
but
instead
of
simply
letting
her
read
the
book
to
me,
I
picked
it
up
and
read
it
to
her.
This
interest
in
reading
grew
and
grew,
and
as
my
writing
capabilities
improved,
so
did
my
desire
to
write
as
well
as
to
read.
One
class
that
made
a
huge
impact
in
my
writing
career
would
be
my
third
grade
class.
Though
I
wrote
short
stories
every
year
in
elementary
school,
none
affected
me
quite
the
way
that
this
class
did.
My
third
grade
teacher
read
to
my
class
Voyage
of
the
Basset
by
James
C.
Christensen,
a
complex
and
beautifully
illustrated
book.
After
my
class
had
finished
listening
to
the
story,
we
were
then
encouraged
to
create
and
illustrate
our
own
stories
for
the
rest
of
the
year.
I
remember
how
some
students
were
very
fast
and
managed
to
write
and
illustrate
a
new
story
every
week
or
so.
Some
managed
to
finish
ten
or
more
during
the
course
of
the
year,
while
I
only
wrote
four.
That
said,
I
was
slightly
frustrated
as
I
watched
my
classmates
race
to
finish
new
stories.
Mine
always
ended
up
taking
quite
a
long
time
and
were
always
far
longer
than
the
stories
my
classmates
would
write.
I
loved
the
stories
that
I
wrote
and
liked
making
them
longer,
for
it
gave
me
a
chance
to
write
even
more.
This
newfound
passion
for
writing
was
not
entirely
easy
for
me
to
nurse,
however,
because
some
of
the
other
students
noticed
how
much
longer
it
took
me
to
write
a
story
and
could
not
believe
I
would
put
that
much
time
or
effort
into
a
project.
My
best
story
that
year,
which
I
titled
NThe
Mysterious
Kitten,O
was
pages
and
pages
longer
than
anything
anyone
else
had
written.
Once
our
stories
were
complete,
we
would
share
them
with
the
class.
I
remember
some
of
the
students
telling
me
that
they
would
fall
asleep
when
I
finally
finished
that
story
and
read
it
to
the
class.
At
first,
I
became
disconcerted
when
I
heard
the
mockery
from
my
students,
but
my
teacher
was
always
very
supportive
of
me.
When
I
finally
finished
that
story
and
read
it
to
the
class,
I
could
tell
that
all
of
my
classmates
were
impressed
by
my
story,
in
spite
of
themselves.
Though
I
was
inspired
by
many
other
years
and
experiences,
it
was
that
class
and
my
third
grade
teacher
who
showed
me
that
not
only
was
I
capable
of
writing
a
story,
but
it
was
something
that
I
truly
enjoyed
doing.
My
fourth
grade
class
also
was
instrumental
in
helping
me
improve
and
become
a
better
writer.
As
I
am
sure
many
writers
will
attest,
the
link
between
reading
and
writing
is
very
significant.
It
is
very
hard
for
a
person
to
be
passionate
about
one
and
not
the
other.
With
that
in
mind,
it
was
during
my
fourth
grade
year
that
I
first
was
introduced
to
the
Harry
Potter
series.
My
teacher
read
the
first
two
books
out
loud
to
my
class,
and
I
instantly
fell
in
love
with
them.
I
immediately
bought
the
third
book
as
well
and
began
reading
J.K.
RowlingOs
books
with
a
fervor
that
I
had
never
previously
experienced.
Everything
about
the
books,
from
the
writing
style
to
the
characters,
intrigued
me.
While
we
still
created
some
short
stories
for
class
that
year,
I
realized
that
not
only
did
I
want
to
continue
to
write,
but
I
wanted
to
write
novels,
complex
stories
that
could
be
published
and
made
into
books.
Of
course,
I
still
had
much
to
learn
about
the
English
language
and
grammar,
so
I
started
paying
more
and
more
attention
in
my
English
classes.
Though
I
had
always
borrowed
books
from
the
library,
I
was
now
looking
in
a
new
section,
the
Young
Adult
section,
for
other
longer
and
more
complex
novels
to
further
inspire
me.
In
sixth
grade,
my
English
class
was
actually
broken
down
into
two
classes.
One
was
called
NReading,O
and
the
other
was
called
NWriting.O
I
enjoyed
both
immensely,
and
now
I
had
double
the
usual
amount
of
time
to
work
on
my
two
new
favorite
skills.
My
Reading
class
was
taught
by
one
of
the
best
teachers
I
ever
had.
At
first
she
seemed
intimidating,
from
her
I
was
able
to
increase
my
love
of
books
and
develop
an
appreciation
of
them
as
well.
Though
I
was
not
as
fond
of
my
Writing
class
teacher,
that
class
was
one
of
my
most
inspirational
classes.
The
class
was
entirely
devoted
to
writing
D
all
different
sorts
of
writing.
Though
I
have
always
loved
prose
stories
the
best,
I
worked
on
writing
poems,
writing
based
on
prompts,
even
some
peer
editing.
The
class
was
more
like
a
workshop
than
anything
else,
and
I
absolutely
loved
it.
I
worked
on
many
different
writing
assignments
throughout
the
year,
and
it
was
mainly
due
to
this
class
that
I
started
free-writing
outside
of
school.
Once
I
really
became
inspired
by
the
stories
I
was
working
on
in
class,
I
found
that
a
mere
forty
minutes
a
day
was
nowhere
near
enough
time
to
write.
At
first
I
simply
continued
the
writing
assignments
that
I
worked
on
in
class.
Later
that
year,
however,
I
decided
to
start
writing
stories
during
my
free
time
simply
as
a
form
of
entertainment.
This
was
the
year
that
I
started
my
first
novel.
Unfortunately,
I
never
actually
finished
it,
but
I
was
able
to
create
a
story
and
fill
up
half
of
a
notebook
before
I
decided
that
I
did
not
like
it
anymore.
Once
I
discovered
that
writing
was
an
activity
that
I
could
pursue
on
my
own,
it
was
hard
to
stop.
Lots
of
times,
I
would
only
write
a
few
pages
of
something
before
I
quit,
but
each
and
every
attempt
made
me
more
passionate
about
writing.
I
also
read
books
at
every
moment
during
this
time.
My
grandmother,
an
avid
reader
and
former
English
teacher,
found
out
about
my
love
of
reading
and
writing
and
started
sending
me
journals,
encouraging
me
to
write
down
my
thoughts
and
stories
all
the
time.
Her
support,
along
with
that
of
my
parents,
convinced
me
that
this
was
a
worthwhile
passion.
My
love
of
reading
and
writing
only
grew
as
I
entered
high
school.
Though
my
school
offered
rigorous
courses,
forcing
me
to
spend
many
hours
a
day
on
homework,
I
always
made
time
for
reading
and
writing.
I
regarded
these
activities
as
ways
to
clear
my
mind
and
help
me
relax.
Since
I
read
so
many
books
of
all
genres,
I
also
tried
writing
in
many
different
genres.
Besides
the
typical
high
school
essay,
during
these
four
years
I
experimented
with
fiction,
historical
fiction,
plays,
poetry,
and
even
fan
fiction.
One
of
my
creative
projects
for
a
program
at
school
had
me
write
a
play
about
the
Trojan
War.
When
my
dog
died
my
sophomore
year,
I
used
poetry
to
express
my
grief.
And,
of
course,
all
the
books
that
I
read
just
continued
to
provide
me
with
inspiration
and
incentive
to
create
my
own
works
of
fiction.
Toward
the
end
of
my
high
school
career,
I
started
taking
writing-focused
classes.
Though
I
loved
spending
my
free
time
writing,
I
also
knew
that
being
in
classes
that
encouraged
lots
of
writing
would
also
help
my
abilities.
I
enrolled
in
my
schoolOs
International
Baccalaureate
Program
my
junior
year.
This
program
is
similar
to
the
Advanced
Placement
program.
While
the
AP
program
focuses
more
on
knowledge
and
facts,
however,
the
IB
program
puts
a
greater
emphasis
on
students
understanding
general
concepts
and
being
able
to
express
themselves
thoroughly
through
writing.
When
deciding
between
AP
and
IB
classes,
I
had
little
difficultly;
since
I
already
loved
writing
and
wanted
to
improve
my
writing,
I
chose
the
program
that
was
more
focused
on
that
aspect.
Deciding
to
become
an
IB
diploma
candidate
was
definitely
a
good
choice
for
me.
The
diploma
required
me
to
take
two
years
of
IB
English
classes,
as
well
as
two
years
of
IB
History.
While
many
people
attempt
to
compare
the
IB
and
AP
history
classes,
I
think
that
there
are
some
important
differences
between
them.
My
class
did
learn
specific
facts
and
figures;
however,
the
most
important
aspect
of
our
class
was
to
be
able
to
form
our
own
conclusions
about
historical
events.
The
IB
History
exam
was
focused
entirely
on
writing.
For
that
test,
we
had
a
number
of
short
essays
and
then
a
few
long
ones,
with
no
multiple
choice
or
other
such
questions.
Since
the
IB
program
was
so
focused
on
writing,
I
usually
had
an
essay
due
in
some
class
every
other
week.
For
the
most
part,
the
essays
were
short
and
not
very
difficult,
but
they
still
forced
me
to
continually
practice
my
writing
and
apply
it
to
new
concepts.
One
of
the
most
important
facets
of
each
IB
class
was
some
sort
of
project
in
which
I
had
to
write
a
formal
and
lengthy
essay,
which
was
sent
overseas
to
be
assessed
by
a
person
on
the
IB
Diploma
board.
Even
in
my
psychology
class,
where
our
final
project
was
to
create
an
experiment,
we
then
had
to
write
a
formal
research
paper
recording
our
findings.
Besides
the
papers
for
each
class,
all
IB
Diploma
scholars
had
to
write
an
Extended
Essay
as
well.
The
Extended
Essay
was
a
paper
on
a
topic
of
choice.
It
was
basically
a
research
paper
that
the
student
had
to
work
on
independently,
using
a
staff
member
as
a
mentor.
For
my
paper,
I
knew
that
I
wanted
it
to
be
in
the
realm
of
English,
and
so
I
asked
my
English
teacher
of
two
years
to
be
my
mentor.
My
topic
was
on
the
role
of
women
in
Ancient
Greece.
I
have
always
found
Ancient
Greece
to
be
a
fascinating
topic,
so
the
fact
that
I
wrote
a
lengthy
paper
about
a
subject
I
loved
definitely
helped
my
writing
process.
In
fact,
whenever
I
did
write
essays
and
papers
in
high
school,
I
tried
to
find
some
aspect
of
the
topic
that
particularly
appealed
to
me.
I
found
that
when
I
was
truly
interested
in
the
topic,
writing
took
less
effort
and
the
papers
themselves
were
written
better.
My
senior
year,
I
joined
the
staffs
of
both
my
high
school
newspaper
and
literary
magazine.
I
had
never
tried
writing
newspaper
articles
before,
so
I
thought
that
the
class
would
be
interesting.
It
was
much
different
from
any
other
type
of
writing
that
I
had
done
previously.
Since
the
class
was
open
to
students
of
all
grades,
I
was
one
of
the
oldest
students
in
my
class.
My
lack
of
experience
in
writing
articles
did
not
seem
to
matter
much,
for
we
spent
the
beginning
of
the
year
doing
many
exercises
and
listening
to
lectures
about
how
to
properly
write
an
article.
I
learned
that
articles
have
a
very
different
writing
style
and
format
than
most
other
types
of
prose.
I
became
the
copy
editor
of
my
schoolOs
newspaper
that
year,
which
meant
that
in
addition
to
writing
my
own
articles
for
the
paper,
I
had
to
read
over
other
studentsO
articles
and
make
suggestions
about
how
to
revise
them.
I
liked
writing
for
my
schoolOs
paper.
Though
I
was
never
very
outspoken
and
did
not
really
like
interviewing
people,
I
still
found
it
very
interesting
to
hear
peopleOs
views
on
certain
topics.
I
tend
to
overwrite
papers,
but
for
my
articles
I
had
to
learn
how
to
say
things
in
the
most
efficient
manner.
The
class
was
certainly
a
good
learning
experience.
I
also
worked
on
my
schoolOs
literary
magazine
my
senior
year.
At
first
I
was
actually
more
interested
in
being
involved
with
that
than
I
was
with
the
school
paper.
The
literary
magazine
published
the
types
of
writing
that
I
most
frequently
did.
Working
on
the
magazine
was
a
good
experience
as
well.
I
was
able
to
read
other
peoplesO
work
and
even
submitted
some
of
my
own
work.
I
think
that
participating
as
a
staff
member
for
a
structured
class
as
well
as
a
more
lax
one
both
significantly
improved
my
writing.
Due
to
so
many
classes
that
focused
on
the
importance
of
writing,
I
felt
very
prepared
to
start
college.
My
teachers
had
told
me
that
writing
in
college
would
be
tougher
and
different
in
many
ways
from
writing
in
high
school.
However,
I
had
already
written
many
essays
and
papers
for
all
different
subjects
due
to
my
IB
classes.
Though
writing
a
lab
report
will
never
be
my
favorite
kind
of
writing,
such
reports
for
my
psychology
and
biology
classes
have
made
me
rather
confident
that
I
can
still
write
a
good
science
paper.
In
my
English
class,
we
wrote
what
my
teacher
called
Ncommentaries,O
basically
just
informed
essays
on
various
novels,
in
which
we
focused
on
some
particular
aspect
and
then
analyzed
it
using
the
text
for
support.
In
my
history
class
we
wrote
small
entries
on
class
reading
almost
daily.
I
felt
as
though
I
was
definitely
prepared
for
college
writing,
perhaps
even
more
prepared
than
most
other
students
would
be.
Starting
out
freshman
year,
I
expected
to
have
to
write
a
lot
for
college.
Though
I
had
heard
frequently
that
high
school
writing
and
college
writing
were
very
different,
I
was
not
inclined
to
believe
that
would
be
the
case
for
me.
After
all,
my
IB
history
teacher
constantly
told
my
class
that
most
of
the
IB
classes
were
actually
very
similar
to
college-level
courses.
So
though
I
expected
college
writing
to
still
be
a
lot
of
work,
I
never
thought
that
it
would
be
something
that
I
could
not
handle.
These
assumptions
turned
out
to
be
right
for
the
most
part.
This
is
not
to
say
that
I
still
did
not
have
a
lot
more
to
learn
about
writing;
however,
I
felt
rather
confident
when
I
was
writing
most
of
my
papers,
assuming
that
I
knew
what
the
teachers
would
want
and
the
best
way
to
organize
my
essays.
My
two
college
English
classes
so
far
have
really
helped
me
improve
my
writing
even
more.
My
teachers
both
assigned
papers
that
allowed
me
to
stretch
even
further
beyond
my
comfort
zone
and
experiment
with
new
writing
styles.
With
their
essay
prompts
and
the
criticism
they
wrote
on
my
papers,
I
feel
as
though
my
writing
has
continued
to
improve.
Throughout
my
life,
I
have
striven
to
write
well
both
academically
and
creatively.
I
realize
how
important
is
it
for
one
to
be
able
to
express
oneself
through
intelligent
writing
these
days,
and
yet
creative
writing
will
always
be
something
special
to
me.
Though
I
have
shared
my
writing
experiences
so
far
in
life,
I
know
that
they
are
far
from
complete.
I
can
only
hope
to
learn
from
each
and
every
new
experience,
including
this
one,
so
that
I
become
the
best
writer
I
can
possibly
be.
