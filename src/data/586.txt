Something
to
admit:
I
donOt
actually
enjoy
writing.
However,
I
am
absolutely
in
love
with
the
feeling
of
having
written.
This
realization
has
been
perhaps
the
most
conscious
recognition
I
have
obtained
throughout
this
past
year.
Enrolling
in
four
writing
courses,
coupled
with
the
responsibilities
of
being
a
first
year
Writing
Associate,
has
presented
writing
as
a
completely
different
discipline
than
my
previous
notions
had
informed
me.
I
realized
I
didnOt
always
enjoy
writing,
as
I
had
always
so
readily
claimed.
Writing,
for
me,
is
a
hard,
complex,
and
energy-draining
process.
My
feelings
concerning
writing
two,
three,
or
seven
years
ago,
would
have
been
closer
aligned
to
categorizing
writing
as
an
ornate
art
form
and
an
inspired
process.
Today,
I
have
a
new
appreciation
for
writing
as
yes,
creative,
but
also
as
a
struggle.
I
think
of
writing
not
as
innovatively
as
before,
but
perhaps,
Nartistically
formulative.O
This
self-designed
phrase
I
use
to
mean
that
good
writing
is
extremely
structural
in
nature.
Yet
it
also
takes
a
mindful
writer
to
artistically
maneuver
his
or
her
way
throughout
the
paper
to
hide
the
structure,
while
the
reader
still
benefits
from
its
presence.
I
wager
that
the
average
college
student
could
pick
out
the
standard-taught
Nfive
paragraph
essayO
in
around
three
seconds.
Yet
even
some
of
the
richest
texts
and
acclaimed
works
benefit
from
similar
structures.
The
authors
of
such
writing
vary
from
the
middle
school
students
mastering
this
form
in
that
good
writers
have
the
ability
to
incorporate,
weave
and
create
language.
They
work
with
transitions,
shifts,
etc
that
will
mask
such
a
seemingly
arid
work.
This
has
been
my
biggest
discovery
of
the
past
year;
good
writing
is
structurally
beautiful.
It
has
been
this
slow
realization
that,
in
fact,
has
allowed
me
to
consider
myself
a
writer.
I
do
not
regard
myself
as
skilled
or
even
necessarily
good,
but
this
newfound
understanding
of
what
writing
is
and
how
it
is
created
has
welcomed
me
into
a
new
circle
of
colleagues.
Working
as
a
Writing
Associate,
quite
literally,
has
also
provided
me
with
a
new
sense
of
community
to
which
I
was
previously
unfamiliar.
Along
with
the
weekly
staff
meetings,
trainings,
and
drop-in
hours,
I
have
developed
skills
that
range
from
interpersonal
communication,
(both
verbally
and
in
writing)
to
facilitating
academic
discussions,
to
helping
students
develop
their
own
thoughts
and
ideas.
These
skills
were
uncovered,
primarily,
as
the
byproducts
of
individual
conferences
with
my
students,
and
have
aided
in
producing
positive
outcomes
in
terms
of
writer
development
for
both
them
and
me
alike.
Working
as
a
WA
has
played
a
large
function
in
providing
me
with
formative,
writing-centered
experiences
over
this
past
year.
I
loved
sitting
down
with
students,
talking
about
how
they
felt
about
their
class,
the
assignments,
the
professors,
etc.
This
Nbuilding
rapportO
piece
was
emphasized
during
trainings
and
staff
meetings
and
is
a
facet
that
I
feel
is
influential
in
determining
not
only
the
WA/student
NchemistryO
but
also
an
important
factor
in
building
trust.
This
becomes
especially
important
in
conferencing
with
students
in
assigned
classes,
because
we
meet
with
them
more
frequently,
but
should
not
be
overlooked
during
drop-in
conferencing
either.
I
have
to
acknowledge
that
for
me,
this
part
was
one
I
looked
forward
to
the
most;
getting
to
know
people
comes
fairly
easily
to
me,
and
it
was
helpful
to
be
able
to
start
a
conference
with
a
few
questions
to
help
both
myself
and
student
become
more
comfortable
with
the
situation.
My
ease
in
helping
facilitate
these
initial
conversations
(which
themselves
would
evolve
into
more
meaningful
dialogue
as
I
continued
to
conference
with
same
students)
served
as
the
catalyst
from
which
I
was
able
to
draw
some
authority.
I
rarely
thought
of
myself
as
a
NbetterO
writer
than
my
students.
Many
of
them
were
my
age
or
barely
my
junior.
WAs
after
all,
are
just
other
students.
It
is
for
these
reasons
that
some
authority
was
necessary
for
me
to
feel
confident
enough
in
myself
and
my
position
to
give
them
feedback,
another
perspective,
etc.
In
negotiating
the
first
few
minutes
of
the
conference
with
ease,
I
gained
the
studentsO
confidence
and
trust.
This,
in
turn,
allowed
me
to
feel
that
what
I
had
to
say,
academic
in
nature
or
not,
would
be
taken
seriously
and
kindly.
The
progressions
of
these
conference
portions
were
fairly
typical.
What
became
unique,
then,
were
the
experiences
that
followed.
What
was
often
most
difficult
was
acknowledging
that
just
because
a
student
had
chosen
to
word,
paraphrase,
or
organize
something
in
a
way
unfamiliar
to
me,
or
more
simply,
in
a
way
I
would
not
have
chosen
to,
did
not
make
the
studentOs
writing
poor
or
wrong.
Different
rarely
means
bad.
Initially,
should
one
of
these
occasions
occur,
I
would
have
suggested
a
different
way
of
writing
something.
It
took
me
a
few
weeks
to
realize
that
I
was
not
offering
up
a
different
way
of
putting
something,
but
instead,
I
was
suggesting
my
way
of
writing.
I
realized
I
had
no
real
reasons
for
wanting
to
change
the
studentOs
writing
other
than
the
fact
that
I
thought
it
just
sounded
better.
Re-writing
something
so
that
it
sounds
better
is
not
being
an
effective
or
helpful
WA.
This
was
lesson
number
one
I
learned.
Instead,
I
learned
to
look
for
other
things
such
as
sentence
structure.
IOd
work
with
the
student
and
talk
about
how
to
most
effectively
convey
ideas.
Sometimes
it
was
the
way
they
originally
had
it,
sometimes
it
was
the
way
I
would
have
done
it,
but
most
frequently
it
was
a
way
neither
of
us
had
anticipated.
When
I
became
a
WA,
I
also
became
a
learner.
Lesson
number
two:
Correcting
grammar
and
punctuation
is
what
students
want,
but
it
is
rarely
what
they
need.
It
would
be
extremely
easy
for
me
to
read
a
paper,
fix
some
small
errors,
and
send
the
student
on
his
or
her
way.
They
leave
feeling
good
about
their
paper,
and
I
would
feel
good
about
making
students
feel
good.
But
that
is
not
a
WAs
job.
What
is
more
effective
is
to
work
with
students
on
the
harder,
more
hidden
issues
in
their
paper.
Some
of
the
most
difficult
situations
I
have
encountered
occurred
when
students
were
convinced
their
paper
was
perfect
and
they
were
unwilling
to
work
and
discuss
other
options.
One
student
in
particular
consistently
defended
her
poor
syntax
and
awkward
sentence
structure.
When
I
offered
some
additional
ways
to
word
it,
or
when
I
asked
if
she
had
additional
ways
to
word
it,
she
would
become
defensive
and
would
maintain
that
NAny
other
way
of
putting
it
would
not
get
the
same
meaning
across.O
It
took
two
papers
and
many
comments
from
the
professor
scrawling
NawkO
on
her
work
before
she
became
open
to
my
suggestions.
Another
common
and
also
difficult
encounter
I
have
met
has
been
with
students
who,
for
some
reason,
are
just
very
quiet.
They
are
not
defensive
of
their
work
or
stubborn
about
change,
but
getting
them
to
talk
is
like
pulling
teeth.
As
a
proponent
of
keeping
awkward
silence
to
a
minimum,
I
initially
would
fill
in
the
silence
with
more
suggestions,
or
I
would
answer
my
own
question.
For
example:
Me:
NYou
have
two
really
compelling
arguments
for
why
this
graphic
novel
should
be
considered
literature,
but
I
think
your
paper
could
be
strengthened
with
one
more.
Can
you
think
of
any
others
to
elaborate
on?O
**Awkward
Silence*
Me:
NLike
maybe
discussing
the
rhetorical
strategies
that
are
shown
in
the
text
bubbles?O
Student:
NYeah
that
could
work.O
This
is
not
an
effective
method
at
all
and
was
a
very
hard
habit
for
me
to
break.
Giving
the
student
my
idea
is
an
easy
fix,
but
in
the
long
run
is
quite
unhelpful.
I
started
to
hold
out
the
silences
longer,
and
instead
of
looking
at
the
paper,
I
looked
at
the
student.
This
showed
them
that
I
was
expecting
an
answer
to
come
from
them,
not
to
appear
from
the
paper.
And
when
I
didnOt
talk
for
long
enough,
typically,
they
would
start
to
brainstorm
more
ideas.
Allowing
the
student
to
run
their
own
conference
is
perhaps
the
ideal
situation.
These
obstacles
were
beneficial
to
me
as
a
WA,
for
the
reason
that
the
difficulties
led
to
new
conferencing
methodologies
that
I
could
apply
to
not
only
conferences,
but
to
facilitating
dialogue
with
people
in
many
different
types
of
situations.
After
my
first
few
conferences,
I
incorporated
my
new
methods
and
began
to
have
more
effective
WA
meetings.
With
the
difficulties,
however,
came
many
rewards.
These
rewards
I
can
classify
into
two
categories.
The
social
and
personal
rewards
manifested
themselves
in
the
development
of
making
new
friends,
learning
about
the
passions
of
students
outside
of
my
major,
and
even
getting
an
inside
look
as
to
topics
that
were
covered
in
other
classes.
(This
particular
reward,
in
fact,
helped
to
inform
some
of
my
course
selection
choices
for
last
semester)
The
other
rewards
were
far
more
academic
in
nature.
Serving
as
a
WA
helped
me
become
a
better
writer.
I
was
able
to
take
a
lot
from
our
weekly
staff
meetings
and
thoroughly
valued
the
support
of
my
fellow
WAs.
In
turn,
I
additionally
obtained
much
higher
expectations
of
myself
as
a
writer.
As
I
alluded
to
before,
I
began
to
think
of
writing
in
a
completely
different
way.
Writing
became
technical.
Something
I
could
grasp,
fix,
and
become
better
at.
There
was
nearly
a
procedure
to
writing,
and
I
found
comfort
in
these
mechanical
and
methodological
processes.
I
began
to
oddly
love
introductory
paragraphs
and
how
they
served
as
a
road
map
and
guide
to
my
papers.
I
enjoyed
creating
outlines
that
helped
me
draw
parallel
themes
and
structures.
I
started
to
appreciate
writing
more
than
I
had
before.
It
still
wasnOt
something
I
regarded
as
NfunO
or
entertaining
but
it
was
no
longer
something
I
had
an
aversion
toward.
I
came
across
many
surprises
in
working
as
a
Writing
Associate.
Even
in
reading
the
narrative
assignment
I
answered
NYES!O
to
most
of
questions
posed
to
us.
Breaking
rules,
mirroring
behaviors
and
most
definitely
turning
to
other
WAOs
for
advice
and
support
are
all
techniques,
so
to
speak,
that
I
employed.
Spending
time
in
the
writing
room
during
other
WA
conferences
was
extremely
helpful,
as
I
was
able
to
listen
and
piece
together
some
of
my
favorite
practices
from
other
WAs
that
I
respected.
I
learned
sometimes,
itOs
not
always
best
to
chug
through
the
paper,
but
that
a
meaningful
dialogue
about
just
part
of
the
assignment
or
paper
with
the
studentsO
thoughts
is
actually
more
helpful
in
getting
the
student
to
think
of
supporting
ideas
and
the
direction
of
their
paper.
Taking
notes
for
them
on
the
paper
as
they
talk
is
a
great
way
to
get
out
ideas
and
express
opinions
the
might
not
have
felt
when
they
were
worried
about
making
their
paper
sound
good.
One
student
writer
in
particular
left
saying
that
she
was
NExcited
now
to
write
her
paperO
because
she
left
our
conference
having
brainstormed
many
more
main
arguments
and
we
were
able
to
work
one
the
basic
structure
of
her
paper.
She
affected
me
in
particular
because
I
was
absolutely
able
to
understand
that
writing
a
paper
can
be
a
fun
experience
if
one
feels
like
they
have
meaningful
things
to
contribute
and
put
down.
I
loved
that
I
was
able
to
help
give
her
that
feeling
for
that
particular
assignment.
At
the
beginning
of
this
next
semester,
I
see
myself
starting
out
similarly
to
the
first
time.
I
think
I
will
be
a
little
apprehensive
at
first,
especially
before
my
first
set
of
conferences,
but
I
am
certain
that
my
confidence
will
increase
after
the
first
conference
or
so.
I
care
a
lot
about
this
position
and
know
that
student
writers
put
a
lot
of
trust
in
to
WAs.
Whether
this
is
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
is
another
topic
to
be
debated,
but
I
take
that
trust
very
seriously.
I
am
excited
for
another
semester
of
helping
writers
and
growing
as
one
as
well.
