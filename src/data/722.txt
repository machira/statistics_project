Returning
WA
Narrative
After
receiving
confirmation
that
I
would,
in
fact,
have
a
position
with
the
College
Writing
Program,
I
knew
I
had
to
take
advantage
of
this
opportunity
to
the
fullest
and
try
to
impress.
Going
through
my
old
grammar
and
mechanics
textbooks
I
had
collected
throughout
the
years,
I
brushed
up
on
all
of
the
rules
and
the
lingo
of
the
grammar
world.
By
the
end
of
my
review,
I
was
disgusted
when
I
spotted
a
split
infinitive,
and
I
could
diagram
a
sentence
with
the
best
of
them.
Being
somewhat
young
to
have
a
job
as
a
writing
associate,
I
had
to
make
a
strong
impression
somehow,
and
I
figured
having
a
keen
knowledge
of
mechanics
would
put
me
ahead
of
the
game.
During
orientation,
however,
it
became
evident
fairly
quickly
that
although
mechanics
and
proper
grammar
can
play
a
very
important
role
in
conveying
thoughts
clearly,
nitpicking
at
every
single
comma
splice
or
misused
semi-colon
was
not
the
primary
duty
of
a
writing
associate.
Over
the
next
three
months
or
so,
I
became
familiar
with
a
completely
different
way
of
looking
at
papers.
This
new
method,
the
facilitative
approach,
taught
me
to
focus
on
ensuring
the
paper
made
sense,
accomplished
what
it
set
out
to
do,
addressed
the
prompt,
was
geared
towards
the
appropriate
audience,
and
other
things
that
I
had
assumed
most
people
always
did.
Having
to
look
at
papers
in
this
way
intimidated
me
because
these
rules
werenOt
concrete.
With
grammar,
there
is
a
defined
set
of
rules
that
determined
whether
something
was
right
or
wrong
which
I
found
very
comforting.
However,
with
the
facilitative
approach,
things
were
not
so
black
and
white.
Everything
was
a
judgment
call,
and
relying
purely
on
what
I
thought
was
right
and
wrong
terrified
me.
I
had
no
clue
how
I
was
qualified
to
judge
the
work
of
my
peers,
but
these
were
all
fears
I
had
before
I
had
read
my
first
studentOs
paper.
Once
I
began
reading
over
the
studentsO
works,
it
became
pretty
clear
what
my
position
actually
entailed.
My
first
meeting
with
my
partner
professor
went
very
well.
I
had
gone
through
all
of
the
questions
that
were
suggested
during
the
discussion
group,
and
afterwards,
I
felt
pretty
confident
that
I
knew
what
the
professor
was
looking
for
in
the
first
assignment.
Without
the
guidance
I
had
acquired
during
the
first
weekly
conference,
I
would
have
never
have
made
the
most
of
the
first
meeting
with
the
professor.
Because
it
went
so
well,
I
think
my
professor
gained
a
little
more
trust
and
confidence
in
me
which
was
crucial
throughout
the
semester.
After
such
a
successful
meeting
with
my
partner
professor,
I
felt
good
about
starting
to
look
at
the
papers.
When
I
began
to
read
over
the
papers,
I
had
my
red
pen
ready
to
go.
As
I
began
reading,
I
started
to
fall
back
into
the
habit
of
circling
every
little
mistake
possible,
but
by
the
end
of
the
paper,
I
was
tired
of
it,
and
I
was
sure
the
student
would
be
as
well.
Instead
of
going
through
every
paper
like
that,
I
learned
that
it
is
helpful
to
maybe
point
it
out
a
few
times,
and
then
make
a
note
of
it
at
the
end
or
in
the
margin
so
I
could
discuss
it
with
the
student
later.
This
way,
it
wouldnOt
be
me
holding
the
studentOs
hand
through
every
correction,
but
rather,
the
student
would
be
forced
to
go
over
his
or
her
work
again,
but
this
time
with
these
things
to
look
out
for
in
mind.
By
the
second
or
third
paper
though,
it
became
very
clear
to
me
what
NmajorO
and
NminorO
problems
were.
Each
student
had
their
own
specific
issues,
but
I
was
surprised
at
how
many
times
the
narrative
would
lose
its
focus,
fail
to
address
specific
parts
of
the
prompt,
or
begin
an
idea
and
not
support
it.
I
realized
that
my
previous
fears
about
being
unqualified
were
not
as
grounded
as
I
had
thought.
Although,
I
might
not
have
been
able
to
pick
out
every
detail
or
help
the
student
develop
each
thought
as
much
as
more
experienced
writing
associates,
I
could
definitely
point
out
the
major
mistakes
and
work
with
the
student
to
try
and
at
least
get
them
to
identify
where
the
problem
was
and
brainstorm
possible
ways
to
fix
it.
After
making
notes
on
each
of
the
papers,
I
felt
pretty
confident
and
excited
to
have
first
conference.
I
imagined
it
would
be
this
fascinating
back
and
forth
where
my
ideas
would
go
and
spark
some
huge
creative
epiphany
and
we
would
both
leave
the
conference
extremely
satisfied
with
the
conference.
Unfortunately,
that
was
far
from
the
reality
of
my
first
conference.
My
first
student
arrived
somewhat
late
which
allowed
me
to
review
his
paper
really
quickly.
There
were
some
major
issues
that
had
to
be
addressed,
but
I
believed
that
with
work,
we
would
be
able
to
have
a
functional
piece.
When
he
arrived
and
we
were
able
to
discuss
his
paper,
it
became
apparent
that
he
felt
that
his
piece
was
very
strong
despite
the
lack
of
coherence
and
failure
at
addressing
the
prompt.
I
tried
to
ask
him
about
why
he
had
made
certain
choices,
but
he
became
very
defensive.
He
seemed
to
disagree
ardently
that
his
piece
was
fine.
At
one
point,
he
even
asked
me
what
year
I
was,
and
what
my
major
was
in
a
sort
of
tone
that
made
me
think
he
was
questioning
my
qualifications
to
look
over
his
paper.
By
the
end
of
the
conference,
I
managed
to
convince
him
to
look
over
and
consider
what
I
had
suggested.
When
he
left
the
conference,
I
was
mentally
exhausted.
It
took
so
much
out
of
me
trying
to
balance
helping
him,
defending
what
I
was
saying,
and
not
just
giving
up
on
the
conference
while
maintaining
a
somewhat
calm
tone
to
my
voice
to
mask
my
very
existent
frustration.
I
prayed
that
the
next
conference
would
not
be
a
repeat
of
the
first.
My
prayer
did
come
true,
but
apparently,
I
should
have
been
more
specific
about
what
I
wanted
to
have
happen
because
my
next
student
never
showed
up.
After
a
pretty
disastrous
first
day
with
the
student
(which
should
have
been
students),
I
mustered
up
the
strength
to
drag
myself
back
to
Pardee
and
try
again.
The
student
who
I
was
seeing
that
day
had
a
pretty
strong
piece
already
and
just
needed
some
minor
issues
addressed.
When
he
came
in
and
we
started
to
talk,
I
could
tell
that
he
actually
enjoyed
writing
the
piece.
His
enthusiasm
for
the
assignment
and
his
work
energized
me
as
well,
and
together
we
were
able
to
bounce
ideas
back
and
forth
off
of
each
other.
This
was
what
I
was
hoping
for
because
it
was
the
first
time
where
I
felt
like
my
interaction
with
the
student
was
appreciated
and
also
would
lead
to
improvement.
After
my
first
three
experiences
interacting/lack
of
interacting
with
the
students,
I
think
I
learned
a
lot.
I
donOt
know
if
I
realized
it
at
the
time,
but
looking
back
on
it,
I
learned
how
not
to
and
how
to
interact
with
the
students
and
basically
experienced
the
two
extremes
as
conferences
go.
Although
I
was
miserable
during
the
first
conference,
it
might
have
been
one
of
the
greatest
opportunities
for
learning
for
me
as
a
writing
associate.
The
next
time
when
I
had
a
conference
with
that
particular
student,
I
asked
him
how
his
first
paper
went,
and
he
said
the
teacher
had
pointed
out
similar
things
to
what
I
had
tried
to
address
the
first
time
around.
I
feel
like
this
allowed
him
to
trust
me
and
my
judgment
which
allowed
us
to
start
making
progress
on
his
writing.
Throughout
the
semester,
I
worked
with
students
of
varying
degrees
of
writing
skills,
but
what
I
found
to
be
fascinating
was
watching
the
studentsO
progress.
No
matter
where
the
student
was
at
in
the
beginning,
after
each
round
of
conferences,
small
improvements
were
made
each
time
as
long
as
an
effort
was
made
in
general.
The
first
draft
would
have
no
transitions,
no
coherence,
and
no
focus.
But
by
the
third
paper,
you
could
tell
that
small
changes
had
been
made
that
indicated
that
the
student
was
going
in
the
right
direction.
These
small
changes
were
signals
to
me
that
the
students
had
learned
during
our
time
together
and
were
implementing
these
modifications
in
their
writing.
I
was
very
proud
that
I
could
make
an
impact
on
these
writers.
Another
thing
that
made
my
job
rewarding
and
enjoyable
was
when
the
students
would
actually
participate
constructively
in
the
conferences.
Before
taking
this
job,
I
thought
that
all
conferences
would
be
like
this,
but
in
reality,
it
can
sometimes
be
a
rare
gem
to
have
a
student
actually
enthused
to
work
on
his
or
her
writing.
When
a
student
gains
something
from
the
experience,
not
only
does
the
student
end
up
in
a
better
place
than
where
they
had
started,
but
also,
I
become
motivated
to
improve
my
skills
to
keep
up
with
my
students.
If
they
continue
to
improve,
I
cannot
expect
to
stay
the
same
or
else
I
will
be
out
of
a
job
and
my
WA
student
will
have
one.
I
am
so
appreciative
to
have
a
position
where
I
am
paid
and
can
obtain
some
level
of
personal
growth
every
week,
but
there
are
some
situations
that
frustrate
me
to
no
end.
For
the
most
part,
all
of
my
students
were
very
willing
to
work;
however,
several
times
I
ran
into
situations
where
a
student
obviously
made
little
to
no
effort
at
all.
Of
course
you
have
the
missed
appointments,
which
waste
your
time,
but
if
the
student
merely
made
a
mistake,
IOm
usually
not
too
bothered
especially
if
it
is
the
first
time
offense.
What
really
bothers
me
is
when
there
are
tons
of
typos
and
unfinished
sentences.
These
are
mistakes
that
can
be
easily
corrected
if
a
work
is
read
over
once.
When
I
see
these
types
of
mistakes,
I
know
the
student
typed
it,
printed
it,
and
gave
it
to
the
teacher.
There
was
never
a
time
where
they
sat
and
thought
about
it
after
the
fact,
or
really
looked
at
it.
When
such
little
thought
is
put
into
a
work,
it
makes
me
wonder
why
I
should
put
more
work
into
looking
at
something
that
the
student
obviously
did
not
care
about.
These
types
of
errors
distract
me
from
being
able
to
focus
on
the
bigger
picture
because
I
physically
cannot
ignore
a
paragraph
full
of
fragments
and
twenty
Ntheir/thereO
mistakes.
Not
only
is
it
distracting,
but
it
also
blurs
the
meaning
and
creates
confusion
which
makes
my
job
harder.
Through
my
job
as
a
writing
associate,
I
have
been
able
to
explore
writing
in
a
way
I
never
thought
I
would.
IOve
always
had
to
write
papers,
but
with
the
skills
I
have
gained
during
my
time
as
a
writing
associate,
I
have
the
ability
to
analyze
my
writing
in
a
more
intellectual
way.
Before
I
had
written
based
off
my
emotions
and
what
I
thought
was
best,
but
now,
I
determine
where
I
am
going
with
a
specific
sentence
and
what
it
conveys
all
while
I
am
writing
or
afterwards
in
the
editing
process.
I
am
more
adept
to
edit
my
own
papers
which
I
have
found
to
be
an
invaluable
skill.
No
longer
do
I
have
to
rely
on
others.
Now,
I
can
go
through
the
entire
writing
process
myself,
though
I
do
occasionally
ask
for
an
extra
pair
of
eyes
after
learning
the
importance
of
getting
another
perspective.
