Considering
Days
Spent
Writing-
A
Recognition
of
Myself
as
a
Writer
E.

CWP
Prof.

Donahue
I
began
life
as
a
slightly
jaundice
child
with
hair
not
unlike
that
of
a
peach,
which
is
to
say
sparse
and
lightly
pigmented.
Initially,
at
least
according
to
my
parents,
there
was
not
much
in
the
way
of
profound
thought
emanating
from
my
lips.
Apparently
I
was
gifted
enough
to
know
that
I
should
preserve
my
strength
as
great
numbers
of
my
peers
would
be
expecting
profundity
later
in
life.
Unlike
many
of
my
Lafayette
counterparts,
I
actually
remember
very
little
of
my
days
as
a
preschooler.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
most
of
my
life
up
until
the
4th
grade
is
quite
a
blur.
I
can
blame
this
shortage
of
cognizance
on
the
propensity
of
my
father's
career
to
keep
the
family
moving
around
the
eastern
seaboard.
Having
to
change
schools
three
times
in
10
years
is
not
exactly
beneficial
if
one
strives
to
maintain
consistency
in
their
education.
I
expect
that
my
inability
to
remember
my
kindergarten
teacher
will
prove
to
be
a
source
of
great
trauma
as
my
life
progresses.
In
essence,
then,
my
literary
life
truly
began
when
I
was
presented
with
the
opportunity
to
compose
two
pieces
of
creative
writing.
One
of
these
was
assigned
by,
of
all
people,
my
sixth
grade
math
teacher,
while
the
other
was
not
assigned
at
all.
The
unassigned
paper
was
actually
a
response
to
gross
mistreatment
on
my
behalf
by
the
public
school
system
which
I
was
subject
to.
As
a
red-head,
I
was
naturally
the
target
of
most
of
the
harassment
which
went
at
the
junior-high
level.
Also,
any
attempt
to
retaliate
was
immediately
extinguished
by
teachers
who
were
conveniently
ignorant,
except
when
the
most
noticeable
kid
in
the
classroom
was
acting
out.
As
such,
this
unassigned
piece
of
writing
was
a
satirical
medley,
finding
its
roots
in
popular
children's
lore.
The
main
character
of
this
piece
was
a
music
teacher
of
mine
who
decided
that
he
was
going
to
remedy
my
supposed
behavioral
disorder
by
prosecuting
me
to
the
fullest
extent
of
junior-
high-school
law.
Naturally
the
driving
force
behind
this
self
assigned
work
was
a
great
deal
of
angst,
precipitated
by
an
abundance
of
free
time
during
an
in-school
suspension.
Once
this
paper
fell
into
the
wrong
hands,
however,
I
then
had
an
English
teacher
who
also
made
it
her
goal
to
discipline
her
most
distinguished
red-headed
student.
My
second
memorable
writing
experience
took
place
when
a
pop
quiz
required
us
to
explain
the
mathematical
concept
of
the
"factor-tree"
in
a
creative
way.
As
I
buckled
down
to
undertake
what
I
expected
to
be
another
feeble
attempt
at
a
minor
examination,
suddenly
all
of
my
thoughts
fell
into
place.
I
understood
the
factor
tree,
which
was
helpful,
but
not
the
center
of
my
thought
process.
Though
I
could
not
explain
it
at
the
time,
I
felt
a
sudden
relief
as
I
began
to
write.
I
now
understand
this
relief
as
the
feeling
a
writer
gets
when
everything
about
your
argument
falls
into
place
and
the
assignment
almost
begins
to
write
itself.
I
had
logically
thought
out
the
progression
of
my
argument
and
was
prepared
to
convey
it
with
a
notable
degree
of
creativity.
At
the
time,
I
was
not
as
exuberant
about
my
work.
The
following
day,
however,
I
was
asked
to
read
it
aloud
in
front
of
the
class.
As
the
person
the
class
loved
to
make
fun
of,
however,
this
was
a
less
than
favorable
result
to
my
new-found
talent
for
writing.
The
experience
as
a
whole,
was
not
a
bad
one.
The
class
seemed
to
put
their
feelings
for
me
as
a
person
aside
and
enjoyed
what
I
had
to
offer
in
the
way
of
story
telling.
It
was
either
that
or
they
were
simply
pleased
that
we
did
not
have
to
continue
with
out
scheduled
lesson
plans
for
that
morning.
As
it
turns
out,
that
math
teacher
was
suprisingly
supportive
of
my
work
from
that
point
on,
realizing
that
I
had
fallen
by
the
wayside
as
she
tried
to
both
educate
the
truly
intelligent
kids,
and
discipline
the
real
problems
in
the
class.
She
actually
suggested
that
I
transfer
to
a
local
private
school
which
would
be
more
geared
towards
students
like
me,
who
require
more
attention
than
the
average
student.
This
second
writing
assignment,
then,
could
be
viewed
as
my
proverbial
springboard
into
writing.
The
following
fall,
I
began
as
a
seventh
grader
at
Newark
Academy
in
beautiful
Livingston,
New
Jersey.
Situated
on
63
sprawling
acres
within
walking
distance
of
a
large
mall,
one
could
not
find
a
better
learning
environment,
for
a
seventh
grader,
anyway.
Both
the
teachers
and
the
students
at
Newark
Academy
were
a
far
cry
from
what
I
had
gotten
used
to
at
public
school.
This
is
not
to
say
that
I
was
outclassed
by
them,
but
rather,
I
saw
that
they
were
very
intelligent
and
I
able
to
assimilate
like
never
before.
This
made
for
immediate
comfort,
which
allowed
me
begin
undertaking
my
schooling
in
a
more
serious
way.
One
of
the
primary
goals
of
this
school,
besides
creating
the
most
well
rounded
student
possible,
is
to
instill
solid
writing
mechanics
in
each
student,
so
that
once
the
student
begins
to
formulate
logical
arguments
on
their
own,
they
can
convey
them
with
ease.
I
have
found
this
preparation
to
be
invaluable
in
attacking
the
academic
challenges
at
Lafayette.
In
fact,
I
may
very
well
have
been
over-prepared,
if
that
is
possible.
If
I
have
learned
any
new
writing
skills
at
Lafayette,
they
were
subconscious
because
I
believe
that
the
skills
I
use
today
are
the
ones
which
I
developed
throughout
high
school.
I
think
that
this
preparation,
in
part,
stems
from
my
teachers'
being
over
critical
of
our
work.
Two
particular
instances
come
to
mind
when
I
consider
my
high
school
writing
experience.
The
first
occurred
during
my
freshman
year
and
the
last
during
my
senior
year.
By
freshman
year,
having
two
years
of
experience
at
N.A.,
I
felt
that
I
had
a
good
handle
on
the
difficulty
level
of
the
work.
This
changed.
The
humanities
course
all
freshmen
were
required
to
take
was
called
The
Ancient
World.
This
was
my
first
contact
with
the
teachers
whom
I
considered
to
be
exceedingly
intimidating.
One
in
particular
seemed
to
scrutinize
everything
which
I
said
or
wrote.
Towards
the
end
of
the
winter
semester,
we
were
assigned
a
paper
having
to
do
with
the
bible.
Due
to
the
ambiguity
of
the
assignment
(I
was
still
getting
used
to
being
a
freshman),
I
misunderstood
the
teacher's
overall
intent.
I
did,
however,
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
in
preparation
on
this
assignment
and,
as
far
as
I
was
concerned,
the
outcome
of
this
toil
was
my
best
interpretation
of
the
assignment.
The
teacher
did
not
view
things
in
the
same
way.
He
was
aghast
with
the
fact
that
I
could
have
possibly
misunderstood
his
assignment
and
graded
my
paper
on
the
grounds
that
I
had
not
actually
completed
the
work.
While
this
may
have
technically
been
the
case,
I
was
one
of
the
better
students
in
the
class
and
felt
that
I
did
not
deserve
the
C-
I
received.
I
remember
this
day
in
particular
as
the
one
when
my
parents
later
informed
me
that
I
was
to
stop
going
to
the
only
school
I
had
truly
enjoyed
and
move
with
them
to
southern
California.
Bad
days
like
these
rarely
rear
their
ugly
heads,
at
least
in
my
life.
Los
Angeles,
educationally
speaking,
is
the
arm-pit
of
schooling,
at
least
as
far
as
public
schools
are
concerned.
Luckily
I
was
going
to
go
to
a
private
school,
which
ultimately
turned
out
to
offer
a
public
school
education
with
private
school
facilities
and
discipline.
As
such,
it
was
a
nice
break
from
the
academic
rigors
Newark
Academy
had
to
offer.
Ultimately,
however,
the
progression
of
my
education
suffered.
In
terms
of
writing,
I
accomplished
absolutely
nothing.
My
English
teacher
was
one
who
would
be
considered
a
nightmare
by
anyone
who
was
vaguely
enthusiastic
about
the
pursuit
of
literary
analysis.
This
was
how
it
worked:
Whatever
grade
he
gave
you
on
the
first
paper,
this
was
the
grade
you
got
on
essentially
every
paper
thereafter.
I
felt
as
though
I
could
have
handed
in
a
typed
version
of
the
verbiage
from
the
Nordstrom's
Circular
and
I
would
have
gotten
the
same
grade.
We
did
however,
prepare
for
the
English
achievement
exam
for
some
time,
which
I
have
found
to
have
helped
my
grammar.
This,
in
turn,
did
help
my
writing,
but
only
in
the
strictest
mechanical
sense.
After
a
year
of
treading
academic
water
in
earthquake
alley,
I
was
informed
that
we
would
be
moving
to
New
Jersey
again,
where
I
could
continue
my
tenure
at
Newark
Academy.
I
was
thrilled,
to
say
the
least.
Upon
returning,
however,
the
true
effects
of
"my
year
off"
made
themselves
readily
apparent.
I
could
not
write
a
paper,
at
least
a
quality
paper,
for
a
good
six
months.
Luckily,
my
English
teacher
was
astute
enough
to
understand
what
was
going
on
and
did
her
best
to
both
cushion
the
blow
on
my
GPA
and
offer
as
much
constructive
criticism
as
she
could.
I
still
consider
her
to
be
one
of
the
finest
teachers
I
have
ever
had
the
privilege
of
learning
from.
After
a
while,
things
began
to
fall
into
place
and
my
papers
began
to
resemble
the
ones
I
was
writing
before
I
left
for
the
sunshine
state,
adjusted,
of
course,
for
my
advancement
as
an
overall
student.
So
that
I
would
not
get
to
big
a
head,
however,
I
acquired
a
teacher
during
my
senior
year
who
made
it
his
goal
in
life
to
scrutinize
everything
my
classmates
and
I
handed
him.
At
one
point,
after
a
few
of
my
projects
had
met
with
less
than
favorable
commentary,
I
distinctly
remember
him
telling
me
to
"stick
with
the
sciences,
because
I
would
not
be
able
to
handle
the
work
at
the
collegiate
level."
That
comment
sticks
out
in
my
mind
as
much
as
the
day
I
went
back
to
visit
everyone
at
Newark
Academy.
I
made
it
my
goal
for
the
day
to
find
this
teacher
and
ever
so
subtly
inform
him
that
I
had
acquired
not
one
but
two
majors:
Economics
and
English.
Always
maintaining
the
upper
hand,
however,
he
replied,
"why
are
you
studying
Economics,
because
it's
so
interesting?"
He
said
this
in
the
most
sarcastic
tone
he
could
muster.
While
I
achieved
limited
satisfaction
from
this
exchange,
I
did
acquire
a
friend
who
I
have
repeatedly
visited
and
who,
in
spite
of
his
behavior,
was
and
still
is
very
interested
in
my
development
as
both
a
writer
and
as
a
human
being.
After
that
day,
I
finally
understood
that
this
genuine
interest
in
the
person
and
not
just
the
student
is
what
makes
Newark
Academy
so
special.
High
school
only
lasts
four
years
and
we
all
must
go
on
to
bigger
and
better
things.
Mine
was
Lafayette
College.
After
a
four
day
stint
as
an
engineer
(I
actually
believed
what
my
instructor
told
me),
I
returned
to
the
arts.
My
first
year
seminar
was
a
far
cry
from
the
horrific
experiences
most
students
have.
I
still
consider
it
to
be
one
of
the
best
classes
I
have
taken
here.
This
experience,
along
with
the
advice
and
support
of
my
first
year
resident
advisor
(who
later
became
one
of
my
closest
friends)
led
me
to
declare
myself
an
English
major.
In
working
in
this
department,
I
have
found
a
limitless
supply
of
fabulous
courses,
taught
by
some
of
the
most
dynamic
personalities
in
higher
education
today.
I
have
been
able
to
enjoy
these
courses
for
one
reason
alone:
because
I
can
enjoy
the
courses.
I
have
found
that
I
have
such
a
command
over
the
mechanics
of
writing
that
I
do
not
have
to
worry
about
the
papers
and
the
grading
methods.
I
have
been
able,
at
least
up
until
this
point,
to
enjoy
the
subject
matter
for
what
it
is
and
use
it
to
formulate
opinions
and
theories
about
the
history
of
man.
The
education
I
have
achieved
thus
far
has
given
me
a
better
understanding
of
where
we,
as
a
race,
have
been
and,
more
importantly,
where
we
are
going.
This
is
not
to
say
that
I
am
not
challenged
at
Lafayette,
but
rather,
the
challenge
lies
in
trying
to
take
in
as
much
as
I
can
in
the
four
years
which
I
have
to
work
with.
This
I
believe,
is
considerably
harder
than
making
sure
that
you
have
a
coherent
argument
and
all
of
your
paragraphs
are
linked
together
smoothly.
I
am
fortunate,
then,
to
have
arrived
at
this
point
in
my
education,
where
I
can
consider
this
very
education
on
a
global
scale,
and
not
just
as
a
series
of
requirements
and
credits.
The
driving
force
behind
this
supposed
enlightenment,
I
suppose,
has
been
my
ability
to
write.
It
is
for
this
reason
that
I
consider
myself
a
writer,
and
not
just
a
person
who
writes.
