FlFTEEN
YEARS
OF
PENCILS
AND
PAPER
Literary
Narrative
August

1999
One
of
the
earliest
writing
memories
I
have
is
of
green
lined
paper,
the
kind
with
solid
lines
bracketing
the
writing
space
with
a
dashed
line
running
between.
The
dashed
line,
of
course,
was
meant
to
guide
the
formation
of
letters,
so
that
lower
case
letters
would
not
be
too
small,
and
capital
letters
would
not
be
disproportionate.
It
was
on
this
green
lined
writing
paper
that
we
would
compose
sentences
using
words
that
we
had
just
learned
to
spell.
I
was
surprised
and
dismayed
as
a
first
grader
when
one
of
these
green
sheets
was
returned
to
me
with
the
word
thru"
circled.
I
had
misspelled
it?
But
I
had
seen
it
spelled
that
way
on
signs,
such
as
"drive-thru."
It
was
then
that
I
learned
that
the
spelling
on
street
signs
was
not
always
correct.
Since
then
I
have
been
very
conscious
of
words
I
see
and
hear
such
as
shoppe,"
"donut"
(another
source
of
error
in
first
grade),
acrosst",
anyways,"
and
"lite"
In
third
grade,
my
class
was
assigned
a
presidents
report,
in
which
was
had
to
select
a
president
and
write
a
biographical
report,
including
pictures.
I
chose
Abraham
Lincoln,
and
proceeded
to
forget
about
the
assignment.
The
night
before
it
was
due,
there
I
was
in
my
house,
reading
about
Abraham
Lincoln.
The
assignment
was
essentially
to
recount
important
events
in
the
president's
life
in
about
five
to
seven
handwritten
pages.
It
had
to
be
written
in
cursive,
which
I
hated.
Even
now,
I
usually
print,
but
sometime
I
mix
in
some
cursive.
At
any
rate,
my
report
was
finally
completed.
I
made
my
construction
paper
cover
and
used
brads
to
hold
it
together.
That
was
my
first
research"
paper.
As
third
graders,
we
were
not
asked
to
put
forth
our
own
ideas
concerning
the
presidents,
such
as
why
he
was
successful,
or
how
history
would
have
been
different
if
he
had
not
been
in
command.
There
was
no
hypothesis
for
us
to
try
to
prove.
Hence,
in
my
mind,
it
was
not
really
an
exercise
in
writing;
it
was
an
exercise
in
reading
and
stating
facts.
In
third
grade
the
class
was
given
journals
in
which
to
write
our
thoughts,
write
stories,
or
whatever
we
wanted.
I
began
writing
limericks
and
silly
Shel
Silverstein-esque
poems
when
I
had
some
free
time
in
class.
Usually,
following
Silverstein's
style,
my
little
creative
works
were
accompanied
by
a
pencil
drawing
of
the
person
or
creature
concerned
in
the
poem.
I
think
I
used
my
journal
for
writing
poems
more
than
anything
else.
I
may
have
written
a
few
(very)
short
stories
too.
In
fourth
grade
and
fifth
grade
we
were
given
journals
again,
so
I
had
three,
and
I
still
have
them
all
in
a
box
at
home.
The
journals
from
fourth
and
fifth
grade
contain
poems
as
well.
In
sixth
grade
I
do
not
recall
having
a
journal,
but
in
seventh
grade
I
did.
This
time
we
would
have
certain
times
in
our
reading
class
where
we
would
have
to
write
in
our
journals.
Usually
there
was
a
certain
topic
to
write
about.
I
remember
once
having
to
write
about
the
death
penalty,
either
in
favor
of
it
or
against
it.
That
was
essentially
the
first
time
I
remember
trying
my
hand
at
persuasive
writing.
I
do
not
remember
doing
any
real
research
to
write
it.
Now,
however,
I
know
that
passion
alone
does
not
make
a
good
persuasive
paper.
One
must
be
able
to
support
an
opinion
with
facts.
In
third
grade
we
only
concerned
ourselves
with
the
facts
without
really
questioning
them
or
offering
our
own
ideas.
Then
in
seventh
grade,
it
was
reversed;
we
consulted
facts
infrequently
and
based
our
essays
almost
entirely
on
our
opinions.
Eighth
grade
is
not
especially
memorable
as
far
as
writing
is
concerned.
One
assignment
that
I
remember
was
in
our
U.S.
history
class.
We
had
to
create
a
journal
from
someone
in
the
19th
century.
I
chose
a
gold
miner.
This
is
the
first
time
I
remember
having
to
write
in
a
very
specific
style.
My
character
was
poorly
educated,
a
characteristic
that
had
to
be
evident
in
his
writing.
In
addition,
I
had
to
create
the
atmosphere
in
which
he
was
writing,
to
imagine
what
his
life
might
have
been
like,
and
combine
it
with
what
I
had
learned
in
the
class
to
create
authentic-sounding
journal
entries.
Still,
that
assignment
drew
primarily
on
creative
abilities.
It
was
in
ninth
grade
that
writing
began
to
be
more
challenging.
In
9th
grade
English,
we
still
had
occasional
creative
writing
assignments.
That
year,
though,
we
actually
began
to
study
the
English
language
and
how
it
could
be
used
as
an
effective
tool
for
communicating
ideas.
We
started
writing
essays.
Mine
were
satisfactory,
I
suppose,
just
not
very
sophisticated
or
particularly
articulate.
That
was
a
tough
year,
but
I
finished
it
with
a
better
idea
of
how
to
write.
In
11th
and
12th
grades
I
was
in
AP
English.
The
first
year
was
language
and
composition,
and
the
second
literature
and
composition.
The
first
year
of
AP
I
had
my
9th
grade
English
teacher
again,
and
she
brought
us
up
to
the
next
level
of
writing.
"Timed
writings"
became
my
new
arch-nemesis
that
year.
I
dreaded
walking
in
and
seeing
the
stack
of
white
lined
paper
and
the
photocopies
with
the
writing
task
written
on
them.
The
forty
minutes
we
had
to
write
the
essay
were
always
grueling.
First,
one
must
read
the
task
and
the
accompanying
written
selection.
Then
the
questions
are
"Do
I
understand
the
piece?
Can
I
answer
the
question?
Can
I
write
a
decent
conclusion?"
The
last
question,
of
course,
being
the
most
critical
question
to
me.
I
was
always
worried
about
having
a
strong
thesis
statement
and
a
good
conclusion.
Doing
all
of
that
in
40
minutes
was
quite
the
challenge,
but
it
helped
my
writing
be
more
clear
and
concise.
My
senior
year
of
high
school
was
really
productive
as
far
as
English
class
is
concerned.
Not
only
did
we
have
weekly
timed
writings,
we
also
had
three
research
papers
and
additional
creative
writing
assignments.
I
had
never
thought
it
might
be
difficult
to
write
a
villanelle
until
I
was
assigned
to
write
one.
Satires,
limericks,
and
sonnets
were
also
required.
From
the
variation
in
the
writing
assignments
I
learned
to
apply
writing
skills
to
different
individual
tasks.
Unfortunately,
topics
of
papers
or
particular
writing
formats
are
assigned,
not
chosen.
Those
writing
assignments
forced
me
to
be
a
little
more
flexible
in
how
I
approached
a
writing
task.
I
had
to
*
actually
received.
Some
people
in
my
class
would
have
to
rewrite
almost
their
entire
papers,
while
I
had
a
few
awkward
sentences
and
sentence
order
problems
to
fix.
This
has
been
the
case
in
both
college
classes
I
have
had
where
I
have
met
with
a
WA.
From
the
meetings
with
WAs
I
began
to
develop
a
new
perspective
towards
writing.
I
still
hold
myself
to
high
standards,
but
I
also
understand
how
important
it
is
to
write
clearly.
When
I
write
an
essay
or
a
paper,
I
want
to
have
expressed
myself
clearly
enough
so
that
someone
unacquainted
with
the
subject
could
understand
what
I
have
written.
Sometimes
I
will
ask
a
friend
to
take
a
look
at
a
paper
and
then
tell
me
what
my
main
points
are.
My
friends
ask
the
same
favor
of
me.
This
is
especially
helpful
for
evety/one
since
usually
an
engineer
will
be
reading
my
paper,
and
I,
as
a
non-engineering
student,
will
be
reading
an
engineering
report.
We
then
will
ask
each
other
questions
about
certain
points
or
terms
that
we
don't
understand.
The
system
we
have
established
seems
to
work
well,
and
I
have
developed
a
genuine
appreciation
for
peer
editing.
As
I
enter
my
final
year
at
Lafayette,
I
know
that
writing
is
going
to
be
even
more
important
for
me.
This
semester
I
will
be
writing
geology
papers,
as
well
as
a
history
term
paper.
I
have
also
decided
to
write
a
geology
thesis,
which
is
somewhat
of
a
grand
undertaking
for
me.
The
longest
lab
report
I
have
ever
written
is
maybe
15
pages
long.
A
thesis
will
have
to
be
much
more
detailed.
The
real
challenge
will
lie
in
writing
a
science
paper
of
significant
length.
Scientific
writing
is
different
than
writing
about
literature
or
history
in
that
it
is
more
objective.
This,
I
think,
can
make
it
a
bit
more
difficult.
I
would
prefer
to
be
able
to
support
opinions
I
have
formed
about
an
issue,
than
to
use
data
to
support
a
hypothesis.
Because
of
this
challenge,
I
am
looking
forward
to
this
year
with
a
mixture
of
excitement
and
trepidation.
We
shall
see
how
it
goes.
