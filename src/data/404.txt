My
Transition
to
Pre-Writing
and
Drafting
Last
year
when
I
wrote
this
statement
as
a
returning
WA,
I
could
not
think
of
any
significant
way
either
my
writing
style
or
my
writing
process
had
changed
over
the
past
year.
Instead,
I
was
able
to
report
what
I
had
learned
as
a
Writing
Associate
about
being
a
Writing
Associate.
Now,
looking
back
over
the
past
year,
I
think
that
at
the
time
I
wrote
my
last
essay,
I
was
in
a
transitional
period
of
my
writing-life.
Only
now
that
I
have
seemingly
completed
that
transition
can
I
see
the
change
that
was
afoot
then.
Sometime
last
year
I
realized
that
I
had
virtually
stopped
writing
papers
at
the
last
minute
(i.e.Nbeginning
them
the
night
before)
and
somehow
had
acquired
and
began
to
use
the
skills
I
needed
to
pre-write
effectively.
By
Npre-writeO,
I
mean
here
the
processes
of
brainstorming,
outlining,
and
especially
drafting.
I
began
to
both
think
about
and
write
(in
one
form
or
another)
as
soon
as
I
received
assignments.
Before
that
time,
I
might
spend
some
time
thinking
about
an
assignment
before
I
put
anything
on
paper,
but
once
I
began
writing,
I
was
automatically
writing
my
final
draft.
However,
once
I
started
Npre-writingO
I
felt
far
more
relieved
as
I
handed
in
papers,
knowing
that
I
had
worked
diligently
for
a
while
on
them
rather
than
finishing
them
the
night
before
class
as
the
products
of
all-nighters.
Not
feeling
as
tired
the
next
day
was
also
a
welcome
corollary
consequence!
Of
course,
its
hard
for
me
to
tell
if
the
actual
quality
of
the
papers
I
handed
in
were
actually
of
better
quality
than
their
late-night
predecessors.
That
is
the
thing,
it
would
seem,
about
pre-writingNyou
cannot
really
tell
whether
it
NworksO
or
not.
That
is,
it
seems
impossible
to
tell
when
you
do
prewriting,
if
the
paper
produced
is
a
better
one
than
the
one
that
would
have
been
written
last
minute
otherwise.
We
would
hope
that
the
former
would
be
better;
after
all,
the
assumption
that
a
paper
that
has
undergone
an
extensive
process
of
writing
is
going
to
be
better
than
one
that
has
not
is
one
of
the
basic
premises
that
underlies
the
WA
program,
I
would
think.
On
another
levelNconfidence
in
my
writing
and
the
feeling
that
I
have
done
the
best
work
I
canNI
know
pre-writing
works.
In
fact,
I
am
glad
I
started
doing
it.
When
I
have
prewritten
extensively
(and
any
prewriting
in
most
cases
would
be
an
improvement
over
my
freshman
and
sophomore
year
efforts)
no
matter
what
the
grade,
I
can
feel
like
I
have
done
the
best
I
could.
Perhaps
thisNthe
feeling
of
confidence,
or
satisfaction,
or
relief
that
comes
as
a
result
of
prewritingNis
in
fact
a
subtle,
understood,
or
implicit
part
of
the
mission
of
the
WA
program.
If
it
is
not
part
of
the
Writing
Associate
Program
mission,
it
probably
is
part
of
the
individual
Writing
AssociateOs
goals
that
at
the
end
of
each
conference,
and
more
importantly
when
the
writer
completes
the
paper,
she
will
feel
something
positive
both
about
her
writing
and
about
the
NfinalO
product
produced.
Each
time
we
as
Writing
Associates
complete
evaluations
of
the
program
at
the
end
of
the
semester,
there
is
a
question
to
the
effect
of,
NFor
you
what
defines
a
successful
writing
conference?O
I
always
write
that
the
feeling
of
satisfaction
and
improvement
in
the
writer
is
one
of
the
major
signals
that
the
conference
has
gone
well.
We
cannot
always
control
the
grades
a
professor
gives
a
paper,
but
regardless
of
the
grade,
if
a
student
feels
he
or
she
is
improving
overall,
that
is
sufficient
for
my
satisfaction
as
a
WA.
In
the
converse,
if
the
papers
are
getting
AOs
but
the
student
does
not
feel
like
we
are
helping
his
writing,
then
the
program
has
to
some
degree
failed
himNafter
all,
he
wonOt
be
returning
on
his
own
to
drop-in,
nor
recommending
us
to
friends.
After
all,
we
are
called
NWriting
Associates,O
not
NPaper
Consultants.O
I
wonder
sometimes,
however,
what
the
true
cause
of
my
fairly
recent
prewriting
is.
A
first
answer
would
indeed
be
the
WA
program.
The
more
I
saw
how
effective
writing
drafts
could
be,
the
more
I
wanted
to
incorporate
them
into
my
own
writing
process.
I
think
somewhere
along
the
line,
the
NWA-meO
took
over
the
other
part
of
me
and
realized
that
writing
and
then
coming
back
to
my
writing
with
a
fresh
perspectiveNperhaps
in
NWA
modeO
could
greatly
benefit
me.
In
previous
years,
there
had
been
no
time
for
the
WA-me
to
jump
in
and
question
my
writing,
because
I
was
writing
at
the
last
minute.
What
often
resulted
was
a
conceptually
solid
paper
without
polish.
This
is
probably
why
I
earlier
claimed
it
is
difficult
to
tell
if
my
writing
is
better
or
worse
as
a
result
of
my
revision
processNbecause
my
ideas
are
largely
the
same
either
way.
Now
I
realize
upon
reflection
that
my
teachers
would
often
comment
that
the
beginnings
of
my
papers
were
confusing
or
somewhat
complicated.
There
were
too
many
ideas
floating
around,
because
I
had
not
taken
the
time
to
allow
the
writing
process
to
unfold.
Now
that
I
have
given
myself
the
time
for
the
WA-me
to
take
over,
I
have
gotten
far
less
of
those
comments
and
less
NgrammarO
corrections.
I
cannot
help
but
think
that
these
changes
are
a
result
of
my
continued
WA
meetings
with
students.
The
more
I
hear
myself
advise
them,
the
more
I
hear
my
own
advice
when
I
write,
and
finally
my
advice
seems
to
have
gotten
through
to
me.
Of
course,
I
cannot
believe
that
there
is
just
one
single
cause
for
anything
in
this
world,
and
certainly,
the
changes
in
my
writing
process
are
no
different.
If
there
is
anything
that
I
have
learned
at
Lafayette,
it
is
that
everything
is
complex.
So,
what
else
could
have
contributed
to
my
pre-writing
process?
I
think
at
least
one
additional
factor
to
consider
when
evaluating
the
changes
in
my
writing
process
over
the
past
year
is
the
assignments
I
received
from
teachers.
On
one
hand,
in
one
or
two
of
my
classes,
brevity
was
key
because
the
professors
gave
me
only
three
to
five
pages
to
express
very
complex
thoughts.
In
both
my
modern
philosophy
class
and
my
Contemporary
Fiction
class,
I
could
no
longer
simply
throw
all
of
my
ideas
out
there
with
all
of
the
evidence
for
my
teachers
to
evaluate
as
a
whole.
Rather,
because
of
the
stringent
page
limits
I
had
to
brainstorm,
pre-write,
and
draft
extensively.
At
times,
I
even
completely
rewrote
a
paper
draft,
without
using
any
of
the
original
draftOs
wording
at
all,
because
I
felt
that
was
necessary
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
assignment.
Of
course,
there
was
no
way
I
could
do
such
a
thing
in
the
night
before
the
paper
was
due,
and
these
were
cases
that
I
am
quite
sure
the
paper
that
I
spent
more
time
on
was
better
than
the
original
draft.
On
the
other
hand,
there
were
the
papers
that
required
more
pages
than
I
had
been
used
to,
for
the
most
part,
in
my
freshman
and
sophomore
years
at
Lafayette.
They
required
extensive
research
and
outside
readings
to
complete.
Papers
in
my
Philosophy
of
Law,
Metaphysics,
and
Modern
&
Contemporary
Poetry
classes
were
of
this
sort.
Whereas
papers
in
my
freshman
and
sophomore
year
may
have
required
five
to
seven
pages,
they
also
usually
did
not
require
the
use
of
resources
outside
the
main
texts
for
the
class.
Thus,
it
was
much
easier
in
my
early
years
at
Lafayette
to
do
a
paper
straight
through
the
night
before
a
class,
because
all
I
had
to
do
was
to
review
the
novel
in
question,
keep
a
note
of
key
quotes
I
wanted
to
use,
and
then
sit
down
and
write.
Due
to
new
types
of
assignments,
I
was
forced
to
change
my
writing
process.
Therefore,
really,
it
may
have
been
the
requirements
of
my
teachers,
limits
on
my
time,
and
experiences
in
writing
conferences
with
my
students
that
enforced
the
need
to
pre-write
effectively.
Appropriately
enough,
the
more
I
remember
this
past
yearOs
conferences
with
student
writers,
the
more
I
see
my
personal
transition
in
writing
reflected
in
those
conferences.
In
my
conferences
last
year,
I
focused
much
more
on
the
earlier
stages
of
the
writing
process
than
I
had
previously.
Thus,
brainstorming,
incorporating
new
main
ideas,
and
considering
arguments
against
the
main
thesis
seemed
to
take
precedence
in
the
conference.
I
questioned
writers
to
consider
their
main
topics,
arguments
and
conceptual
points
more
before
encouraging
them
to
NcorrectO
other
higher
order
concerns,
like
structure,
in
their
papers.
It
is
hard
to
exactly
describe
this
subtle
changeN
that
probably
took
place
subconsciouslyNin
the
way
I
was
conducting
conferences.
If
I
had
to
quantify
the
change
in
focus
to
earlier
writing
stages,
however,
I
would
say
that
sophomore
year
I
spent
about
20
minutes
of
a
30-minute
conference
on
concerns
like
structure
and
thesis,
organization,
and
topic
sentences.
In
contrast,
junior
year,
I
spent
about
twelve
minutes
on
such
concerns
and
eighteen
on
other
concerns
like
counterarguments
and
main
concepts.
In
my
sophomore
year
conferences
I
seemed
to
assume
that
since
the
conference
was
a
few
days
to
a
week
before
the
final
paper
was
due,
the
writer
more
needed
my
help
on
their
NpaperO
(that
is,
Ncleaning
upO
what
was
done
already,
rather
than
examining
the
basic
foundations).
In
my
more
recent
conferences,
I
believe
I
began
to
operate
under
the
assumption
that
I
should
instead
focus
on
the
earlier
phases
of
the
writing
process
instead.
Thus,
even
though
all
four
semesterOs
papers
probably
would
look
about
the
same
to
a
third
person,
I
was
taking
the
papers
last
year
to
be
in
an
earlier
stage
of
writing
than
I
had
in
sophomore
year.
Of
course,
this
is
just
a
quantification
used
for
example
because
my
conferences
always
differ
based
on
the
varying
needs
of
the
writers.
I
see
why
I
focused
more,
or
felt
I
should
focus
more,
on
the
Nprewriting-esqueO
issues
like
formulating
new
ideas,
recognizing
counter
arguments,
and
evaluating
the
validity
of
main
arguments
rather
than
NwritingO
issues,
like
how
to
structure
those
points
in
the
particular
paper.
It
was
because
I
was
undergoing
a
change
of
thought
myself
about
what
would
make
my
own
writing
more
successful.
Thus,
I
would
constantly
question
the
writerOs
main
assumptions:
NWhat
would
you
say
if
I
said
X
to
your
point,
Y,O
was
a
common
line.
Nevertheless,
the
result,
I
hope,
was
that
I
wound
up
improving
their
writing,
and
thinking
about
writing,
over
and
above
improving
the
individual
paper
at
hand.
Turning
the
lens
back
unto
myself,
I
realize
that
perhaps
the
main
change
in
my
writing
last
year
was
because
of
a
new
(even
subconscious)
goalNto
improve
my
writing
as
well
as
to
submit
NgoodO
papers
to
my
teacher.
NGood,O
I
defined
as
whatever
would
get
me
the
grade
I
desired.
Perhaps,
in
fact,
the
reason
why
I
had
difficulty
in
last
yearOs
essay
finding
how
my
writing
had
grown
or
changed
was
that
I
had
temporarily
ceased
striving
to
improve
my
writing.
The
more
I
pre-wrote
and
drafted
last
year,
howeverNin
short,
the
more
I
worked
on
my
paper
prior
to
the
night
before
it
was
due
asking
myself
the
same
questions
I
would
ask
of
my
WA
studentsNthe
more
I
felt
I
was
reaching
my
full
potential
as
a
writer.
So,
now,
there
are
no
more
all-nightersE.at
least
until
Law
School.
