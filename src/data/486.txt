Adjusting
the
Focus
This
last
year
has
been
complicated.
During
the
2004
fall
semester,
for
several
reasons,
I
dropped
two
of
my
classes.
That
was
my
first
semester
as
a
WA,
and
I
lost
my
position
for
the
rest
of
the
year
so
that
I
could
focus
on
my
studies.
Perhaps
that
was
for
the
best,
for
I
performed
well
in
the
spring
2005
semester,
and
everything
seems
to
be
back
on
track.
This
means,
of
course,
that
I
have
not
had
as
much
experience
as
other
returning
WAOs.
With
less
experience
comes
less
opportunity
for
me
to
be
changed
as
a
writer.
However,
it
seems
to
me
that
just
the
experience
of
being
a
WA
for
one
semester
and
getting
to
see
and
work
with
the
writing
process
in
a
new
way
has
had
a
significant
effect
on
me,
even
though
I
have
not
interacted
with
as
many
writers
as
I
might
have.
My
writing
has
changed
significantly,
even
though
I
missed
out
on
some
opportunities
for
advancement.
Of
course,
it
hasnOt
just
been
my
experience
as
a
WA
which
has
changed
me.
Some
of
the
discussions
IOve
had
with
several
of
my
professors
have
influenced
me
greatly,
as
has
my
desire
to
pull
myself
out
of
the
rut
I
started
to
dig
for
myself
during
the
fall
2004
semester.
Other
things
have
been
factors
as
well,
I
am
sure,
whether
or
not
I
recognize
them.
In
any
case,
there
are
two
main
areas
in
which
I
have
changed
as
a
writer
in
this
past
year.
The
first
is
in
my
actual
writing
process;
IOve
always
had
problems
editing
my
own
work,
and
I
believe
IOve
improved
in
this
and
other
areas
of
my
writing
process
quite
a
bit.
The
second
area
in
which
I
have
changed
significantly
is
in
my
focus.
This
is
more
difficult
for
me
to
explain
succinctly,
but
roughly,
I
feel
that
I
have
a
better
understanding
of
the
purpose
of
my
own
writing,
as
well
as
that
of
others.
Before
tackling
that
second
part
about
my
focus,
IOd
like
to
discuss
how
my
writing
process
itself
has
changed
over
the
course
of
the
past
year,
and
to
perhaps
address
what
has
caused
it
to
change
in
the
way
it
has.
In
the
past,
I
wrote
almost
exclusively
in
short
bursts;
I
would
sit
down
and
just
start
writing,
pumping
out
an
essay
or
at
least
a
few
pages
of
one
in
a
fairly
short
amount
of
time.
In
preparation
for
these
brief
periods
of
writing,
I
would
figure
out
most
of
what
I
wanted
to
say,
mull
the
topic
over
for
a
while,
and
just
procrastinate
in
general
until
I
was
ready
to
sit
down
and
get
it
over
with.
I
never
really
wrote
anything
down
before
I
got
started,
and
I
generally
made
few
notes
to
guide
my
writing;
I
tried
to
keep
everything
in
my
head,
writing
less
as
a
planned
process
and
more
as
a
stream
of
thoughts,
or
a
conversation
with
myself.
Now,
I
do
not
believe
that
this
is
the
worst
way
in
which
one
could
write,
but
looking
back,
I
see
that
I
could
have
used
a
little
guidance.
Now
I
tend
to
draw
up
outlines
for
myself;
while
they
may
not
be
very
extensive,
they
are
helpful
in
keeping
me
on
the
right
path
when
I
write.
In
addition
to
these
outlines,
I
have
been
taking
more
writing
notes.
For
example,
I
might
jot
down
notes
on
what
I
wanted
to
say
about
a
particular
issue
or
passage
when
I
first
considered
it.
All
in
all,
IOve
been
doing
a
lot
more
preparing
for
my
writing
a
lot
more
than
I
have
in
the
past.
I
think
this
increase
in
preparation
comes
from
two
basic
sources.
First,
as
a
WA,
I
noticed
that
many
people
wrote
papers
which
lacked
cohesion.
They
may
have
been
good
papers
overall,
but
they
suffered
from
a
lack
of
consistency;
something
which
could
be
greatly
improved
if
more
work
was
done
to
plan
beforehand.
Recognizing
this
in
the
work
of
others
allowed
me
to
see
it
more
clearly
in
my
own.
Second,
I
knew
that
I
needed
to
do
well
during
my
spring
semester,
so
I
prepared
more
thoroughly,
and
I
found
that
it
really
did
improve
my
writing
a
great
deal.
Seeing
how
effective
preparation
can
be,
both
first-
and
second-hand,
drove
me
to
begin
preparing
more
as
a
matter
of
course,
rather
than
as
a
sort
of
last
resort
when
I
knew
I
had
to
do
well
on
a
paper.
In
addition
to
increasing
the
amount
of
preparation
IOve
been
doing,
IOve
been
improving
my
editing
process.
In
the
past,
most
of
the
papers
which
I
handed
in
were,
in
essence,
rough
drafts.
Now,
IOve
always
revised
my
own
writing
as
I
go,
looking
back
on
newly-written
paragraphs
and
rewriting
them
on
the
spot,
but
I
rarely
actually
revised
and
edited
my
papers
in
a
series
of
drafts.
This
multiple-draft
revision
is
quickly
becoming
a
large
part
of
my
writing
process.
After
seeing
how
even
very
good
writers
can
benefit
from
discussing
a
draft
with
me
in
a
WA
meeting,
I
started
to
look
through
my
own
papers
as
if
they
had
been
given
to
me
in
my
capacity
as
a
WA.
I
found
that
I
could
actually
improve
my
own
writing
a
great
deal
just
by
doing
this,
so
I
have
begun
revising
my
own
papers
regularly.
These
sorts
of
changes
are,
of
course,
very
important.
However,
I
feel
that
they
are
more
straightforward;
the
kind
of
changes
which
come
simply
from
increased
experience
with
writing.
As
I
mentioned
above,
there
has
been
another
change
in
my
writing
which
I
believe
has
benefited
me
greatly.
For
lack
of
a
better
word,
I
think
of
this
as
a
change
to
my
focus.
I
feel
that
I
now
have
a
better
grasp
on
what
my
goals
should
be
in
my
writing,
and
on
what
the
fundamental
purpose
of
writing
really
is.
Though
I
knew
that
writing
was
about
communication,
there
was
something
about
that
idea
which
I
never
really
understood.
I
am
not
sure
of
when
it
clicked
for
me
that
I
should
be
trying
to
show
other
people
my
own
thinking
processes
on
paper
when
I
was
writing,
but
I
have
recognized
some
important
moments
which
led
me
to
realize
what
I
was
really
trying
to
do
when
I
was
writing.
One
of
the
most
important
discussions
I
had
about
writing
actually
happened
completely
outside
the
English
department,
and
really
had
very
little
to
do
with
any
paper
I
had
written.
Near
the
end
of
my
freshman
year,
I
was
talking
to
my
Introduction
to
Philosophy
professor
about
pursuing
a
philosophy
degree.
In
the
course
of
our
conversation,
I
mentioned
that
I
had
always
loved
writing,
and
was
thinking
of
majoring
in
English
in
order
to
be
able
to
work
with
writing
more.
He
surprised
me
by
telling
me
that
his
undergraduate
degree
had
been
in
literature,
as
he
had
loved
writing
as
well.
However,
as
he
became
more
involved
in
philosophy,
he
found
that
he
was
getting
satisfaction
from
writing
philosophy
papers.
Maybe
studying
philosophy
was
not
about
writing
in
the
same
way
that
studying
literature
was,
but
the
essential
purpose
of
writing
remained
the
same.
To
be
honest,
he
put
the
idea
forth
a
little
more
simply;
it
was
more
along
the
lines
of,
NIf
you
work
with
fiction,
you
want
to
write
fiction;
if
you
work
with
philosophy,
you
write
philosophy.O
I
actually
didnOt
think
too
much
on
his
statement
immediately.
However,
it
kept
coming
to
mind,
and
when
I
started
doing
more
and
more
philosophy
papers
I
began
to
understand
the
connection
between
a
paper
discussing
Jean
ToomerOs
role
in
the
Harlem
Rennaisance
and
one
examining
the
idea
of
utilitarian
desert.
The
essential
similarity,
I
realized,
is
that
my
basic
goal
in
both
of
these
papers
is
to
communicate
my
thoughts
on
the
subject
to
the
reader.
While
this
may
seem
obvious,
when
I
fully
realized
it,
it
struck
me
as
a
revelation.
I
had
never
really
thought
of
writing
in
that
way
before;
rather,
I
had
thought
of
it
as
split
up
into
individual
parts.
Fiction
was
one
part,
philosophy
another,
analytical
essays
a
third,
and
so
on.
While
these
are
separate
to
some
degree,
it
seems
to
me
now
that
they
are
all
connected
in
a
much
more
significant
way
than
I
had
realized.
It
clicked
for
me
right
about
then,
and
I
understood
that
all
writing
is
basically
an
attempt
to
get
other
people
to
understand
what
you
are
thinking.
Even
in
fiction,
where
you
are
describing
things
that
are
not
real,
you
are
attempting
to
share
your
vision
with
others.
For
some
reason,
this
idea
of
writing
as
a
way
to
get
other
people
to
understand
what
you
are
thinking
had
never
really
occurred
to
me,
and
it
has
changed
the
way
I
think
about
writing
a
great
deal.
With
a
better
understanding
of
writing
in
general,
I
feel
much
more
confident
when
I
discuss
the
writing
of
others,
as
well
as
when
I
write
my
own
papers.
While
I
do
feel
a
little
silly
saying
that
my
big
revelation
was
the
fact
that
writing
is
about
communication,
it
really
has
changed
my
attitudes
as
a
writer
quite
a
bit.
Less
often
do
I
feel
like
I
could
be
telling
people
things
which
are
simply
my
opinions,
rather
than
actually
helping
them
with
their
writing.
Having
gotten
a
more
solid
grasp
on
the
central
focus
of
my
writing,
I
feel
much
more
comfortable
and
in
control.
