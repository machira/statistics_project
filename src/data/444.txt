Writing
as
a
WA
How
could
life
as
a
WA
really
be
that
different?
I
remember
asking
myself
this
very
question
when
I
skimmed
over
the
assignment
for
returning
Writing
Associates
last
summer.
Describing
your
entire
history
as
a
writer,
I
could
see.
But
looking
back
over
the
course
of
only
one
year?
How
much
could
have
really
changed?
At
the
time,
I
was
simply
thankful
for
my
own
assignment
as
a
new
WA.
With
relative
ease,
I
was
able
to
look
back
at
my
history
as
a
writer
and
describe
the
experiences
and
events
that
contributed
most
to
the
writer
that
I
was
at
that
point
last
summer.
However,
the
year
following
took
on
a
life
of
its
own
and
now
of
course,
here
I
am,
detailing
the
history
of
my
life
as
a
writer
and
a
WA
over
the
last
year.
With
a
year
of
experience
behind
me,
I
notice
that
in
fact
many
things
are
different
in
terms
of
my
writing
as
well
as
my
view
of
the
entire
writing
process.
Initially
upon
receiving
my
position
as
a
Writing
Associate,
I
was
both
excited
and
nervous.
I
loved
to
write
and
I
knew
that
being
a
WA
was
something
I
wanted
to
do,
but
in
the
beginning
I
questioned
my
ability.
I
wondered
if
I
would
really
be
able
to
help
others
improve
their
writing.
At
the
fall
training
workshop
I
learned
the
potential
difficulties
in
the
task
assigned
to
WAOs,
and
I
wasnOt
alone
in
viewing
it
as
rather
daunting.
Upon
arriving
to
campus
in
the
fall,
I
was
particularly
happy
to
discover
that
the
First
Year
Seminar
I
was
assigned
to
was
the
same
course
I
had
taken
with
the
same
professor,
just
one
year
ago.
As
a
result,
I
was
able
to
draw
upon
my
personal
experiences
in
the
course
to
offer
the
most
for
the
students
in
the
class.
I
found
that
this
helped
me
tremendously
in
my
confidence
during
those
early
conferences.
I
understood
the
assignments
and
the
expectations
of
the
professor.
Looking
over
my
own
writing
from
my
FYS
in
preparation,
I
was
also
able
to
see
how
far
I
had
come
as
a
writer
since
that
first
semester
freshman
year.
After
I
began
getting
further
into
my
initial
conferences,
I
discovered
something
unusual
happening.
I
found
myself
truly
getting
exciting
about
writing,
about
the
process
of
writing,
and
trying
to
get
my
students
to
feel
the
same
way.
My
experience
was
more
than
Nhelping
them
with
their
papers,O
but
it
became
sharing
with
them
something
unique.
For
me,
it
wasnOt
a
newfound
discovery,
but
my
love
for
writing
was
something
I
never
often
spoke
of.
It
was
something
I
never
felt
the
need
to
share,
prior
to
my
position
as
a
WA.
Simply
being
a
part
of
the
College
Writing
Program
provided
me
with
an
increased
level
of
confidence
in
experimenting
with
my
own
writing.
Before
last
year,
I
was
always
hesitant
to
test
the
boundaries
of
my
writing
ability,
but
the
semester
after
I
became
a
WA,
I
enrolled
in
Creative
Writing
and
truly
challenged
myself.
I
had
never
seriously
written
fiction
or
poetry,
but
the
course
provided
demanding
work
in
these
areas.
It
was
required
that
I
keep
a
journal
detailing
the
number
of
hours
I
spent
writing
each
day,
and
in
an
effort
to
really
improve
in
my
writing,
I
tried
to
be
as
honest
as
possible.
I
used
my
experience
as
a
WA
to
ensure
for
myself
that
I
would
get
the
most
out
of
the
course.
I
knew
that
in
order
to
improve
upon
my
writing,
both
in
poetry
and
fiction,
a
great
deal
of
time
and
energy
must
be
devoted
to
doing
just
that:
writing.
It
didnOt
have
to
be
perfect,
it
didnOt
always
have
to
make
sense,
but
I
now
understood
that
all
of
these
seemingly
random
thoughts
and
ideas
were
a
huge
component
of
the
writing
process.
This
helped
me
a
great
deal
in
expanding
my
abilities
as
a
poet
and
fiction
writer.
In
addition
to
challenging
myself
in
my
own
writing,
one
of
the
things
I
enjoyed
most
about
being
a
WA
was
getting
to
know
the
students
in
the
class
and
feeling
as
though
I
were
truly
making
a
difference
for
them.
Their
progress
over
the
semester
was
often
evident,
and
I
found
such
discoveries
extremely
rewarding.
The
reinforcement
I
received
from
my
both
professor
as
well
as
the
students
in
the
class
also
helped
in
keeping
me
going
when
the
work
was
a
lot
to
handle.
Having
my
professor
tell
me
that
progress
was
visible
with
the
studentsO
writing
really
acted
an
incentive
in
completing
my
duties
as
a
WA.
This
recognition
informed
me
that
I
was
doing
something
right,
and
from
there,
I
was
able
to
help
the
students
and
constantly
improve
in
my
methods.
Never
did
I
think
I
would
be
able
to
receive
a
stack
of
papers,
read
them,
and
then
hold
dozens
of
meaningful
conferences
in
the
days
following.
But
I
learned
to.
I
found
myself
growing
accustomed
to
helping
students.
Initially,
I
was
surprised
at
how
much
work
some
students
needed
to
improve
upon
their
writing,
but
I
quickly
realized
that
that
was
exactly
what
I
was
there
to
do.
Writing
as
a
WA
became
a
lot
more
than
simply
writing.
I
learned
the
intricate
details
of
the
writing
process
through
facing
them
each
day,
both
in
my
writing
for
my
own
courses
as
well
as
through
my
work
as
a
Writing
Associate.
In
addition
to
these
rewarding
experiences,
some
challenges
did
exist.
A
particular
experience
I
had
during
my
fall
semester
as
a
WA
in
which
I
initially
found
difficulty
was
something
I
was
soon
able
to
learn
a
great
deal
from.
The
problem
came
from
a
student
in
the
FYS
I
was
working
with.
The
student
would
come
to
each
conference,
empty-handed,
just
wanting
to
talk
about
his
writing.
In
fact,
aside
from
our
first
meeting
and
despite
my
requests,
he
never
showed
me
anything
more
than
a
page
of
what
he
had
written.
I
was
hesitant
to
allow
this,
but
after
letting
my
professor
in
on
the
situation,
it
seemed
about
the
only
solution.
After
all,
at
least
the
student
was
consistently
showing
up
to
his
conferences.
What
I
learned
from
this
situation
was
the
value
in
discussing
writing.
To
me
it
always
seemed
that
the
only
way
to
help
someone
with
their
writing
was
to
look
over
a
draft
and
offer
suggestions.
However,
through
this
student,
I
learned
the
value
in
voicing
your
thoughts
and
ideas
about
writing.
It
adds
another
element
to
the
process
of
writing,
and
gives
more
life
to
what
is
merely
written
on
paper.
I
went
on
to
often
use
this
very
technique
when
having
difficulty
starting
a
paper
for
one
of
my
courses.
I
would
find
myself
discussing
the
paper
or
topic
in
an
attempt
to
generate
ideas.
For
me,
this
process
became
an
extremely
effective
brainstorming
method.
After
working
as
a
Writing
Associate
first
semester,
I
was
initially
a
little
unsure
of
how
I
would
feel
routinely
meeting
with
a
WA
as
per
the
requirement
of
my
VAST
course.
I
didnOt
know
how
I
would
feel
on
the
receiving
end,
once
having
Ncrossed
over.O
My
classmates
also
wondered,
always
asking
me,
NDo
you
still
have
to
meet
with
a
WA
even
though
you
are
one?O
or
NIsnOt
that
so
weird?O
But
after
the
initial
writing
assignment
for
my
VAST
and
a
subsequent
conference,
I
quickly
realized
that
it
wasnOt
weird
at
all.
If
anything,
I
felt
more
at
ease.
I
had
a
newfound
respect
for
my
WA
and
the
successes
of
the
College
Writing
program.
I
took
my
conferences
more
seriously
than
I
had
when
I
was
a
freshman,
and
as
a
result,
I
benefited
even
more
from
them
than
I
had
in
the
past.
I
knew
what
questions
to
ask
and
what
comments
needed
the
most
attention
during
the
revision
process.
After
realizing
it
wasnOt
at
all
unusual
for
a
WA
to
seek
help
from
another
WA,
I
started
calling
upon
the
advice
of
some
of
my
fellow
WAOs
and
drew
largely
from
this
feedback.
It
helps
to
have
a
fresh
outlook
from
someone
who
brings
to
the
table
their
own
unique
experiences.
As
a
Writing
Associate,
I
was
also
called
upon
more
often
from
friends
to
help
them
with
their
writing.
This
didnOt
bother
me
at
all,
but
rather
I
viewed
it
as
helpful
to
both
my
friends
and
I.
Their
writing
process
was
hopefully
eased,
and
I
became
a
more
informed
reader
with
each
different
writer
or
piece
of
writing
I
worked
with.
In
addition
to
my
experiences
at
Lafayette
that
have
affected
my
history
as
a
writer
over
this
past
year,
I
have
had
two
non-academic
experiences
that
have
also
added
their
own
unique
elements.
During
the
spring
semester
of
last
year,
I
did
some
work
with
the
Express
Times
for
a
special
NHow
ToO
section
they
were
releasing
in
their
newspaper.
During
my
work
with
them,
I
interviewed
local
businesses
and
wrote
what
they
called
Nadvertorials,O
which
consisted
of
a
NHow
ToO
guide
based
on
the
nature
of
the
company.
For
instance,
I
wrote
a
NHow
to
Build
a
Home
TheaterO
for
a
local
business
that
sells
the
equipment.
This
type
of
writing
was
unlike
anything
I
had
ever
done
before.
Interviewing
the
different
businesses
and
incorporating
their
thoughts
and
ideas
into
something
understandable
for
the
average
reader
was
a
challenging
task
at
first,
but
it
taught
me
a
lot
as
well.
I
was
able
to
utilize
and
apply
both
brainstorming
and
writing
techniques
I
developed
through
my
role
as
a
WA.
Through
my
study
of
writing,
I
understood
the
organization
necessary
for
making
my
points
and
positioning
them
as
clearly
and
effectively
as
possible.
In
addition
to
this
experience,
I
had
a
more
intense
internship
with
a
small
public
relations
firm
in
New
York
City
this
past
summer.
This
unique
opportunity
also
worked
in
broadening
my
writing
experiences
and
abilities.
I
was
able
to
apply
what
I
had
learned
about
the
writing
process
through
my
work
in
the
College
Writing
Program.
I
knew
the
most
effective
means
of
getting
my
point
across,
and
doing
so
quickly.
Writing
press
releases,
letters
on
behalf
of
clients,
and
other
day-to-day
projects
in
a
practical
business
environment
helped
me
to
see
the
real-world
applications
of
the
skill
of
writing.
I
found
this,
similar
to
the
writing
I
completed
for
the
Express
Times,
to
be
extremely
rewarding.
It
was
often
the
case
that
many
others
were
to
be
reading
it,
and
it
had
a
purpose.
Sometimes
with
writing
papers
for
courses
at
school,
it
is
difficult
to
see
the
purpose
of
the
end
result
other
than
merely
a
grade.
However,
like
the
writing
done
for
my
courses
at
Lafayette,
the
writing
I
completed
while
at
my
internship
went
through
many
stages.
My
colleagues
and
I
always
read
each
otherOs
worked,
and
provided
feedback
to
produce
the
most
clear
and
concise
outcome
possible,
depending
on
what
the
project
called
for.
This
past
year
I
have
seen
my
writing
improve
a
great
deal.
As
a
result
of
my
experiences
as
a
Writing
Associate,
my
outlook
of
the
writing
process
has
also
gone
through
many
transformations.
Through
this
position
in
the
College
Writing
Program,
I
have
been
exposed
to
many
different
styles
of
writing,
each
of
which
has
made
me
an
even
more
informed
reader.
My
own
experiences
working
with
different
students
or
writing
for
different
courses
have
allowed
me
to
explore
a
variety
of
genres,
from
which
my
comfort
levels
and
interests
have
expanded.
Through
real-world
writing
experience,
I
was
able
to
apply
that
which
I
have
learned
about
writing
and
the
demanding
process
to
produce
effective
results
that
I
am
proud
of.
I
look
forward
to
new
challenges
this
year
that
will
lead
me
to
develop
further
as
both
a
writer
and
an
informed
reader
when
helping
my
fellow
classmates.
