Literacy
Narrative
It
is
funny
you
should
ask
about
my
first
experiences
as
a
writer
because
it
was
just
recently
that
I
stumbled
upon
some
of
my
first
attempts
at
writing
when
my
mother
decided
that
it
was
time
that
I
clean
out
my
bedroom,
which
had
remained
virtually
untouched
since
I
left
for
college.
Cleaning
out
my
bedroom
is
what
I
imagine
an
archeological
dig
would
be
like.
On
the
surface
were
all
of
the
things
that
I
used
most
recently,
the
boxes
I
had
just
brought
back
from
college,
the
books
I
had
used
for
my
classes
last
semester,
and
a
pile
of
dirty
laundry
that
I
had
not
had
time
to
do
during
finals
week.
But,
underneath
this
collection
of
new
stuff,
layers
had
developed
over
time.
There
were
old
posters
and
CDs
I
had
loved
in
high
school,
artwork
and
exams
I
prized
in
middle
school,
and
underneath
it
all,
in
the
boxes
under
my
bed
and
the
corners
I
never
use
anymore,
the
bedrock
of
my
room,
there
were
the
really
old
artifacts:
the
viola
I
played
for
a
few
years
in
elementary
school,
my
favorite
American
Girl
doll,
and
the
picture
books
I
read
growing
up.
It
was
here
that
I
recently
uncovered
some
of
my
earliest
writing
samples,
a
series
of
books
I
had
written
and
illustrated
myself.
I
found
the
five
books
that
launched
my
early
writing
career
lodged
forgotten
in
a
box
under
my
bed.
They
were
all
bare
books
where
inside
I
had
carefully
written
my
stories
in
the
still
uncertain
handwriting
of
someone
just
learning
how
to
spell.
Some
of
the
books
I
had
written
in
elementary
school
and
were
dedicated
to
my
third
and
fourth
grade
teachers,
while
others
were
co-authored
by
my
mom,
and
a
few
I
had
put
together
all
on
my
own.
Each
page
had
a
sentence
or
two
of
a
story
and
an
illustration,
which
I
had
carefully
done
myself
in
crayons
or
markers,
a
testament
to
the
perfectionist
that
I
would
later
become.
The
handwriting
was
not
perfect
(in
fact
the
letters
were
often
backwards),
and
the
plots
were
confusing
at
times,
but
I
remember
how
much
I
used
to
love
to
put
together
my
own
stories,
usually
loosely
based
on
my
favorite
books
at
the
time
because
for
me,
writing
was
always
closely
linked
to
reading.
There
was
The
Months
a
book
of
poetry
that
was
reminiscent
of
Shel
Silverstein,
with
a
four-lined
poem
written
about
each
month.
The
Smalls
and
the
Zoo,
a
story
of
tiny
people
who
get
lost
at
the
zoo,
was
another
one
of
my
books
inspired
by
The
Borrowers
and
Stuart
Little.
I
also
wrote
a
series
of
mysteries,
Ruby
the
Detective,
The
Mystery
of
Alaska,
and
Sara
and
the
Missing
Ring
that
were
made
at
the
same
time
as
I
was
developing
an
interest
in
The
Boxcar
Children,
Nancy
Drew,
and
Encyclopedia
Brown.
I
had
thought
for
sure
when
I
wrote
these
books
that
they
would
be
the
first
of
many
because
I
was
going
to
be
an
author
and
maybe
even
an
illustrator
when
I
grew
up.
My
parents
were,
as
always,
supportive
telling
me
that
if
an
author
was
what
I
wanted
to
be
then
I
would
have
to
work
hard
but
I
could
do
it.
With
this
in
mind
I
prepared
for
my
future
career
by
autographing
the
covers
of
a
few
of
my
books
and
even
writing
an
NAbout
the
AuthorO
biography
for
myself
listing
Neating
ice
cream
and
my
best
friend
ErinO
among
my
most
important
interests.
But,
inevitably,
before
my
bourgeoning
writing
career
could
even
begin
other
things
got
in
the
way,
there
was
homework
to
think
about,
friends
to
play
with,
and
before
long
I
had
stopped
making
books
all
together.
It
wasnOt
until
high
school
that
I
really
began
writing
on
a
regular
basis
again
but
for
a
very
different
reason.
It
was
no
longer
my
own
creativity
that
fueled
my
writing,
but
instead,
grades
and
homework
assignments.
In
high
school
I
was
assigned
my
first
big
research
papers,
lab
reports,
and
essays.
But,
it
was
also
in
high
school,
that
I
completely
lost
confidence
in
myself
as
a
writer.
Looking
back
on
it
now,
I
think
that
the
real
problem
was
that
I
had
never
been
taught
how
to
write
in
a
personalized
way
that
worked
best
for
me.
I
went
to
Pennsbury
High
School,
one
of
the
biggest
high
schools
in
the
area
and
with
nearly
1,000
students
in
my
graduating
class.
No
one
had
ever
taken
the
time
to
teach
me
how
to
formulate
a
thesis,
make
tight
transitions
between
paragraphs,
or
outline
everything
that
I
wanted
to
say
before
I
started.
I
remember
being
so
frustrated
as
I
sat
with
Ms.
Daley,
my
tenth
grade
English
teacher,
as
she
told
me
that
my
paper
was
wrong,
all
wrong.
After
a
few
bad
grades
on
essays
for
Ms.
Daley,
lab
reports
for
my
natural
science
teacher,
Mr.
Roberts,
and
research
papers
for
my
history
teacher,
Mr.
Little,
I
became
convinced
I
could
not
write
at
all.
I
agonized
over
essays
until
even
a
four
or
five
page
paper
would
seem
like
a
daunting
assignment.
I
would
put
off
lab
reports
for
days,
always
giving
myself
other
Nmore
importantO
things
to
work
on
until
it
was
the
night
before
and
I
absolutely
had
to
get
started.
Knowing
that
I
was
not
going
to
do
well
on
my
papers,
essays,
and
lab
reports
made
it
that
much
harder
to
find
the
right
words,
which
only
compounded
my
prolonged
case
of
writerOs
block.
I
cannot
really
say
when
I
regained
my
confidence
as
a
writer.
I
think
that
it
was
a
mixture
of
factors
that
coalesced
sometime
in
between
high
school
and
college.
After
taking
enough
classes
I
got
to
know
myself
better
as
a
student.
I
realized
that
outlines,
which
I
had
always
used
when
I
studied,
could
also
help
me
organize
my
ideas
and
stay
focused
in
my
writing.
Lafayette
also
made
all
of
the
difference.
I
went
from
questioning
the
odds
of
if
I
would
be
called
on
in
a
high
school
class
of
more
than
twenty-five
other
students
to
wondering
when
I
would
be
called
on
in
a
First
Year
Seminar
with
only
eight
other
students.
But,
I
think
most
importantly,
for
one
of
the
first
times
I
was
genuinely
interested
in
what
I
was
learning
and
writing
about
after
taking
classes
with
professors
who
were
experts
in
their
field.
In
particular,
I
specifically
remember
the
first
paper
I
wrote
in
college
because
it
represented
such
a
distinct
break
from
what
I
had
always
known
of
writing
in
high
school.
What
was
so
different
from
high
school
was
not
the
paper
that
I
wrote,
but
the
paper
that
I
got
back.
What
was
the
analytical
essay
on
Willa
CatherOs
O
Pioneers!
that
I
had
turned
in
to
my
First
Year
Seminar
professor
the
week
before
came
back
to
me
covered
in
red
marks
and
filled
with
corrections.
I
still
have
it
somewhere,
probably
buried
as
another
artifact
in
my
bedroom
to
be
uncovered
the
next
time
I
clean.
I
saved
it
because
I
remember
how
it
had
taken
me
by
surprise.
I
had
never
had
a
teacher
devote
that
much
attention
to
reading
what
I
wrote
before.
But
this
time,
instead
of
the
familiar
feeling
of
discouragement
that
yet
another
teacher
thought
I
could
not
write
I
felt
like
someone
was
finally
listening
and
that
each
word
I
chose
to
explain
my
ideas
was
weighed
and
mattered.
It
was
with
this
paper
that
I
first
had
the
opportunity
to
rewrite
my
work
so
that
my
first
draft
no
longer
became
my
final
draft.
As
I
continued
to
take
classes
I
was
interested
in
and
decide
on
my
major
writing
became
easier
for
me.
True,
it
was
not
always
perfect
but
I
finally
began
to
enjoy
writing
again,
which
I
think
was
one
of
the
most
important
parts.
Writing
for
the
classes
I
have
taken
since
my
First
Year
Seminar
is
no
longer
the
painful
process
that
I
knew
so
well
in
high
school.
Instead,
in
a
way,
I
think
that
my
writing
has
come
full
circle
and
I
have
returned
again
to
the
books
I
wrote
in
elementary
school.
This
time,
though,
instead
of
trying
to
find
a
creative
way
to
write
and
illustrate
the
story
I
had
invented,
I
am
looking
for
an
insightful
way
to
articulate
the
ideas
I
develop
about
a
book
or
historical
event.
While
the
problems
I
solve
in
my
writing
are
different,
the
excitement
and
passion
I
feel
about
it
is
the
same
as
when
I
was
little
deciding
on
the
best
illustrations
for
my
stories.
