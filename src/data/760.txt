Returning
WA
Narrative
WA
Privileges
This
past
August
I
had
the
very
odd
experience
of
being
hired
as
an
editor.
For
several
weeks
Principals
of
Economics,
by
David
Colander,
found
its
way
into
my
inbox
in
groups
of
four
chapters
at
a
time.
The
pages
came
as
curious
schematics;
each
sheet
was
extra
large
and
had
a
slew
of
lines
to
indicate
different
boxes
and
placement.
I
was
given
a
checklist
of
items
to
look
for
when
reviewing
the
chapters.
I
was
instructed
first
to
read
for
grammar,
then
to
make
sure
the
colors
in
the
graphs
all
matched,
the
math
was
correct,
the
fonts
were
coordinated
in
the
correct
pattern,
the
margin
notes
were
correctly
positionedNall
told,
there
was
a
full
page
of
possible
problems
I
was
supposed
to
scout
out.
I
went
about
my
work
for
weeks,
sending
stacks
of
papers
with
yellow
sticky
notes
back
to
my
boss.
So
now,
thanks
to
my
glorious
editing
skills,
Dr.
David
Colander
is
aware
that
on
page
762
of
his
latest
textbook
he
added
an
unnecessary
comma
mid-sentence.
IOm
sure
IOve
made
quite
the
impact
on
his
career.
In
all
seriousness,
IOve
read
about
500
pages
of
this
textbook
so
far,
and
IOve
pointed
out
only
one
error
that
I
think
will
actually
alter
studentsO
understanding
of
economics
(a
confusion
of
the
terms
NdebtO
and
NdeficitO
by
the
author.)
My
point?
ThereOs
a
reason
IOm
reading
a
nearly
completed
textbook
instead
of
the
first
draft.
Basic
NeditingO
that
most
think
of,
looking
for
grammar
mistakes
and
citation
slipups,
rarely
adds
much
content
to
a
piece.
ItOs
a
concept
that
the
College
Writing
Program
has
tried
to
drive
home
to
both
WAs
and
students
year
after
year.
Many
hours
into
my
textbook
job
which
has
essentially
become
a
typo
hunt,
IOve
been
reminded
just
how
lucky
I
am
as
a
Writing
Associate.
As
a
part
of
the
Writing
Program,
WAs
have
two
amazing
privileges:
the
chance
to
read
so
many
styles
and
perspectives
on
a
vast
array
of
topics,
and
the
rare
opportunity
to
chat
with
authors.
I
bet
thereOs
millions
of
readers
out
there
who
would
die
for
the
chance
to
talk
to
their
favorite
writer,
and
they
wouldnOt
ask
about
the
misplaced
modifier
on
page
48.
They
would
ask
about
choices
that
characters
made.
NWhy
did
Mark
choose
to
elope
with
Rachel?
Rachel
was
clearly
a
bitch.O
TheyOd
ask
about
information
that
was
left
out,
NdidnOt
Rachel
sleep
with
Carter?
How
are
we
sure
itOs
MarkOs
baby?O
(The
readers
in
this
scenario
are
trashy
novel
lovers).
Incidentally,
these
are
the
same
(ok,
similar)
questions
that
WAs
get
to
ask
of
the
students
they
meet
with.
We
get
a
30
minute
Q&A
with
a
writer
to
pick
her
brain,
and
whatOs
even
better,
we
have
a
chance
to
impact
what
her
final
product
might
be.
I
donOt
know
David
Colander.
IOve
never
met
him,
IOm
not
sure
if
my
boss
who
is
the
consulting
editor
has
even
met
him.
Still,
IOd
love
to
pick
his
brain.
My
suspicion
is
that
heOs
a
fascinating
individual,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
First,
his
writing
style
is
refreshing.
HeOs
aware
his
audience
is
primarily
college
age
students
with
a
billion
other
things
on
their
minds
before
introductory
economics.
He
manages
to
be
relatable
without
talking
down
to
the
reader
and
without
losing
credibility
either.
Second,
I
looked
him
up
on
Wikipedia.
HeOs
quite
accomplished,
having
taught
at
Princeton,
Vassar,
Columbia
and
now
Middlebury.
HeOs
published
over
35
books
and
100
articles,
which
is
about
35
books
and
100
articles
more
than
I
have.
After
stalking
my
phantom
author
via
the
internet,
IOve
come
to
the
conclusion
that,
as
an
English
and
Economics
major,
Dr.
Colander
would
be
a
cool
guy
to
meet.
If
I
could
ask
him
why
he
chose
to
include
a
segment
on
NThe
1%O
or
why
he
wants
me
to
make
an
English
colloquial
term
dictionary
to
accompany
his
work,
I
would.
It
could
possibly
help
him
think
about
his
own
writing,
but
honestly,
itOd
be
a
better
help
to
me.
As
an
aspiring
mind
in
the
economics
and
writing
worlds,
IOm
just
plain
curious.
His
relaxed
writing
style
is
certainly
something
IOd
ask
about,
if
I
had
the
chance
to
NWAO
his
work
rather
than
NeditO
it.
My
writing
style
has
morphed
in
a
similar
manner;
IOve
let
my
tone
in
academic
essays
occasionally
slip
out
of
formality
if
it
helps
me
say
what
I
really
mean.
Sometimes
I
grow
sick
and
tired
of
Ninventing
the
universityO
and
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
mimic
a
pre-established
voice
that
ultimately
belongs
to
someone
else.
I
never
would
have
let
any
informal
tone
into
my
first
college
papers,
but
being
a
WA
has
helped
me
see
that
writing
has
so
fewer
boundaries
than
students
often
assume.
How
many
times
have
I
heard
NCan
I
say
that?O
from
a
student
writer?
Too
many.
If
you
thought
it,
and
itOs
the
most
direct
way
to
convey
your
feelings,
say
it.
Dr.
Colander
actually
had
a
footnote
at
the
beginning
of
the
textbook
explaining
his
laid
back
tone.
The
gist
was
something
like
this,
Nonce
youOve
learned
all
the
OrulesO
of
writing,
youOre
ready
to
go
ahead
and
break
them.O
As
long
as
student
writers
understand
why
certain
NrulesO
exist,
then
I
think
theyOre
fine
to
break.
In
fourth
grade
when
we
write
our
first
five
paragraph
essay,
weOre
told
not
to
use
NIO
in
essays
because
itOs
just
plain
wrong.
Using
NIO
becomes
pretty
important
when
youOre
writing
something
crucial
like
a
personal
statement
or
cover
letter.
While
some
students
assume
the
WA
job
is
about
pointing
out
places
where
students
have
broken
writing
rules,
itOs
really
about
teaching
students
how
to
navigate
writing
without
rules.
Just
as
I
became
curious
while
reading
Dr.
ColanderOs
work,
IOve
grown
curious
when
reading
student
papers.
Two
years
ago
I
worked
with
a
class
about
the
composer
Wagner,
whose
name
I
pronounced
with
a
NWO
sound
rather
than
a
NVO
until
my
eighth
student
politely
corrected
me.
It
was
then
when
I
remembered
the
beauty
of
the
program:
WAs
learn
new
stuff.
IOve
read
about
everything
from
the
ethics
of
dog
training
to
the
resilience
of
Martin
Luther.
Even
when
I
have
to
read
16
papers
on
the
same
topic,
IOm
shocked
by
how
different
each
writer
can
be.
Student
writers
can
approach
the
same
question
from
a
different
angle
or
focus
on
different
details
that
they
find
to
be
the
most
important.
Unlike
my
editing
job,
the
WA
position
offers
the
unique
chance
to
ask
questions
about
the
parts
of
papers
that
intrigue
me
and
I
get
to
learn
even
more.
This
past
year
with
the
program
I
had
the
awesome
opportunity
to
work
with
a
class
called
NTheatre
and
Social
Change,O
at
the
conclusion
of
which
the
students
wrote
plays
and
acted
them
out.
What
a
treat
it
was
for
me
to
witness.
Though
the
students
were
all
first
years,
one
had
already
gained
notoriety
for
a
play
she
penned
in
high
school.
The
five
minute
play
she
wrote
for
this
course
was
stellar.
It
wasnOt
just
the
words,
but
the
visual,
shifting
between
different
readers
lit
up
in
different
parts
of
the
room.
I
had
to
remind
myself
that
I
was
still
NWAingO
and
not
just
listening,
because
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
was
still
a
piece
of
writing
in
progress.
Those
are
my
favorite
moments,
when
a
spark
of
creativity
or
a
personal
story
comes
out,
a
work
becomes
more
than
just
an
essay,
and
IOm
allowed
to
tell
the
author
just
how
special
I
think
it
was.
So
my
goal
for
this
year
is
simple;
talk
as
much
as
possible,
ask
as
many
questions
as
possible,
and
draw
out
as
much
creativity
as
possible.
The
best
paper
IOve
ever
WAed
was
littered
with
grammatical
mistakes,
written
by
a
writer
who
spoke
Chinese
before
learning
English.
Besides
her
use
of
the
word
NdepartmentO
rather
than
Napartment,O
there
was
little
that
altered
the
meaning
of
the
piece.
The
paper
was
about
a
sense
of
place,
and
it
was
an
attempt
to
recall
what
her
home
was
like
in
her
memory
from
childhood.
It
was
fascinating
in
so
many
ways
and
brilliant
not
because
it
was
written
with
so
much
care
or
because
the
citations
were
placed
correctly,
but
because
the
writer
was
sincerely
interested
in
what
she
writing
about.
It
can
be
frustrating
as
a
WA
because
students
often
donOt
care
about
the
piece
that
they
are
writing,
but
it
can
also
be
extremely
rewarding
when
we
can
get
them
to
care.
Overall,
working
for
CWP
has
taught
me
that
writing
has
so
much
more
freedom
than
student
writers
tend
to
think.
This
freedom
can
be
a
blessing
and
a
curse,
both
for
me
as
a
student
writer
and
as
a
WA
trying
to
guide
others.
What
I
know
definitively
is
that
if
you
want
to
have
an
impact
on
a
piece
of
writing,
you
canOt
go
at
it
with
a
red
pen
and
a
yellow
sticky
note
and
highlight
all
the
errors.
You
have
to
have
a
conversation,
one
thatOs
beneficial
to
both
the
writer
and
the
reader.
My
experience
at
the
CWP
has
shown
me
that
we
as
WAs
are
a
lucky
group,
with
the
chance
to
converse
with
authors.
I
prefer
to
think
of
them
as
authors,
rather
than
student
writers,
because
it
represents
how
much
of
the
piece
belongs
to
themNwhether
they
are
professors
at
Princeton
or
students
at
LafayetteNand
how
much
it
is
our
privilege
to
read
and
discuss
their
thoughts.
