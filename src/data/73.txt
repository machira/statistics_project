My
History
as
a
Writer
August
22,1996
My
earliest
memories
concerning
words
began
in
the
first
grade.
I
remember
being
fascinated
by
the
infinite
ways
in
which
words
could
be
used
to
express
different
meanings
simply
by
being
placed
in
different
orders
in
a
sentence.
For
example,
a
simple
noun,
like
the
word
orange,
kept
me
intrigued
for
days.
Let
me
explain.
Our
class
used
to
collectively
create
a
poem
about
a
different
color
at
the
end
of
each
month.
One
month
our
class
was
writing
about
the
color
orange.
The
teacher
was
explaining
how
the
word
orange
had
two
meanings
which
could
be
expressed
at
different
times
simply
by
its
placement
in
the
context
of
the
rest
of
the
sentence.
I
remember
being
slightly
confused
at
first,
but
I
also
remember
spending
much
time
reading
over
the
poem
and
trying
to
figure
out
what
made
orange
a
fruit
in
one
sentence
and
orange
a
color
in
the
other.
Who
knew
a
fruit
could
be
so
complex?
During
the
second
grade
I
became
mildly
obsessed
with
expanding
my
vocabulary.
It
all
began
when
my
second
grade
teacher
assigned
us
to
interview
one
member
of
the
class
each
week
and
write
a
one
paragraph
biography
on
the
selected
person.
I
noticed
that
everyone's
summary
came
out
almost
identical
because
everyone
used
the
same
adjective,
favorite.
The
papers
were
riddled
with
clone
sentences
such
as;
his/her
favorite
food,
drink,
sport,
etc.
I
decided
to
break
the
mold
and
boldly
choose
a
different
adjective.
I
chose
the
word
enjoyed
to
replace
the
word
favorite
in
my
paper.
My
teacher
was
so
impressed
that
she
stopped
the
class
to
read
my
paper
aloud.
Being
a
typical
second
grader,
I
viewed
my
teacher
as
a
godess
and
was
completely
thrilled
to
hear
my
teacher
praise
me.
In
order
to
further
impress
my
teacher,
and
also
in
order
to
satisfy
my
own
growing
interests,
I
began
to
constantly
inquire
about
new,
exciting
and
impressive
words
that
could
be
used
to
replace
old,
boring
and
mundane
words.
My
vocabulary
quickly
grew
to
the
point
that
my
teacher
even
made
a
special
effort
to
comment
to
my
parents
about
my
use
of
vocabulary.
During
this
time
I
also
wrote
a
description
of
my
mother
for
an
assignment
on
the
person
whom
we
admired
the
most.
My
piece
was
chosen
to
be
displayed
in
our
local
mall.
When
my
mother
visited
the
mall
and
read
my
writing
she
was
moved
to
tears.
This
was
the
first
time
that
anything
I
had
written
invoked
an
emotional
response
from
the
reader.
I
was
amazed
that
the
words
I
had
written
down
on
paper
could
have
the
magnificent
power
to
move
someone
to
such
emotion.
In
the
third
grade
I
was
assigned
my
first
creative
story
assignment.
I
fell
in
love
with
the
genre
of
the
creative
story.
I
began
to
create
stories
on
my
own
in
my
spare
time.
I
loved
to
have
my
parents
read
my
stories
so
I
could
see
their
reactions.
I
also
wrote
a
thirty
page
story
(
this
was
thirty
pages
written
on
extremely
wide
lined
third
grade
writing
paper)
about
a
disappearing
third
grade
teacher
which
was
dedicated
to
my
own
teacher.
My
teacher
appeared
to
me
to
be
amazed
by
my
story
and
even
took
the
story
so
she
could
type
it
on
real
paper
for
me.
Needless
to
say,
my
teacher
still
has
the
original
copy
to
this
very
day.
Third
grade
was
also
when
I
began
to
learn
script
writing,
which
I
hated.
I
found
that
in
order
for
me
to
write
script
neatly
I
had
to
put
immense
concentration
on
formatting
each
letter.
This
over
emphasis
on
letter
construction
took
away
from
my
concentration
on
the
actual
story
I
was
writing.
I
could
not
wait
till
I
graduated
from
elementary
school
because
I
had
heard
a
rumor
that
no
one
was
forced
to
write
in
script
once
you
reached
junior
high
Sschool.
I
also
found
that
no
matter
whether
I
was
writing
in
script
or
not,
I
enjoyed
the
fluidity
of
a
pen
much
more
than
a
pencil.
I
felt
that
the
pens
smooth
lines
made
my
words
flow
onto
the
paper
much
easier.
During
the
fourth
and
fifth
grades
I
enjoyed
taking
part
in
the
advanced
reading
groups.
I
found
that
I
had
a
profound
love
of
reading
and
that
I
could
easily
understand
the
meanings
behind
stories.
I
took
great
enjoyment
in
reading
a
story
and
then
answering
questions
to
see
if
I
was
an
attentive
reader.
During
my
final
years
at
the
elementary
school
level
I
began
to
write
my
own
songs.
I
remember
that
my
fifth
grade
teacher
used
to
allow
me
to
perform
my
written
songs
for
the
class
each
Friday.
There
was
nothing
I
got
greater
pleasure
form
than
composing
lyrics
and
putting
them
to
a
tune
to
entertain
my
class.
My
entry
to
junior
high
school
proved
to
be
very
beneficial
for
my
writing
skills.
I
was
blessed
with
an
amazing
writer
for
my
sixth
grade
teacher.
He
was
a
man
who
taught
our
class
how
to
liven
up
all
our
writing
with
the
usage
of
words.
He
taught
us
how
the
use
of
adjectives
and
verbs
could
transform
our
average
writing
into
masterpieces.
I
admired
this
teacher
so
much
that
I
was
thrilled
when
he
took
me
under
his
wing
and
took
special
time
with
me
and
my
writing.
I
feel
that
my
writing
today
still
reflects
his
teachings.
In
the
seventh
grade
I
was
introduced
to
many
wonderful
books
such
as
Animal
Farm
which
dealt
with
symbolism.
This
was
the
first
time
I
came
into
contact
with
characters
who
completely
represented
something
else
on
a
different
level.
I
was
utterly
fascinated
by
authors,
such
as
Orwell,
who
could
create
stories
with
such
double
meanings.
I
loved
to
decipher
who
each
character
represented
and
try
and
figure
out
what
the
author
was
trying
to
convey
through
each
character.
I
was
also
introduced
to
the
classical
English
writer,
William
Shakespeare.
I
was
no
exception
to
the
well
known
rule
that
all
children
dread
Shakespeare.
Despite
my
initial
weariness,
I
soon
learned
that
Shakespeare
was
an
extremely
interesting
writer
and
that
his
plays
were
filled
with
intrigue,
suspense
and
dialogue
that
rivaled
anything
I
had
ever
read.
I
soon
took
great
pleasure
in
deciphering
his
old
English
and
even
began
to
understand
his
quirky
humor.
During
the
eighth
grade
I
took
a
journalism
class.
My
teacher
taught
us
that
in
order
to
write
in
journalism
one
must
be
completely
unbiased
when
covering
a
story.
I
remember
hating
not
being
able
to
include
my
own
opinions
into
my
writing.
I
did
not
like
writing
news
articles
because
they
were
too
restrictive
because
they
did
not
allow
enough
room
for
the
author's
own
opinions
and
perspective.
I
entered
my
High
School
with
great
expectations
which
were
not
met
by
my
freshmen
year
teacher.
She
was
a
women
who
preferred
to
talk
about
her
own
opinions
on
the
novels
we
read
rather
than
hold
class
discussions
on
our
own
opinions.
I
remember
felling
very
angry
as
she
sat
up
in
front
of
the
class
lecturing
us
about
what
she
felt
the
author
was
trying
to
express
and
never
once
asking
any
members
of
the
class
for
their
own
views.
Another
disappointment
was
that
she
never
assigned
us
any
writing
assignments,.
Our
only
chance
to
express
ourselves
through
our
writing
cam
at
the
end
of
the
year
when
we
were
assigned
a
paper
about
what
we
felt
about
her
class.
It
was
around
these
years
that
I
first
typed
on
a
typewriter.
It
was
such
an
enjoyment
to
be
able
to
express
my
thoughts
so
quickly.
Although
many
of
the
pupils
around
me
were
beginning
to
use
computers,
I
shied
away
from
them
because
I
found
them
inhuman
and
scary.
It
took
me
twice
as
long
to
write
my
paper
and
then
type
it
as
it
did
for
my
fellow
students
to
simply
use
the
computer
and
then
proofread
their
papers
on
the
computer
screen.
Despite
this,
I
continued
to
use
the
typewriter
over
the
computer
through
high
school.
In
the
tenth
grade
we
discussed
human
nature
in
my
English
class.
We
read
Lord
of
The
Flies
which
I
thoroughly
enjoyed.
I
remember
the
interesting
discussions
our
class
had
on
the
many
meanings
about
nihilistic
human
nature
that
the
book
held.
I
also
remember
taking
immense
pleasure
in
writing
a
paper
about
t
what
the
author
was
trying
to
express
through
the
writing
of
this
novel.
During
my
sophomore
year
I
also
had
an
experience
with
a
chemistry
teacher
whom
I
greatly
admired
for
his
shear
genius
in
the
field
of
science.
I
remember
that
one
day
he
left
a
note
for
me
on
one
of
my
test
papers
and
I
quickly
noticed
that
many
words
were
misspelled
and
that
the
gammer
was
very
poor.
When
I
brought
the
test
up
to
him
to
discuss
my
grade,
he
apologized
for
his
poor
writing
abilities
and
said
that
he
just
didn't
have
a
mind
for
English.
I
was
greatly
shocked
that
a
man
whom
I
thought
was
so
brilliant
could
struggle
so
hard
with
the
English
language.
I
came
to
the
realization
that
the
English
language
was
very
complex
and
that
it
was
just
as
difficult,
if
not
more
difficult,
to
master
as
the
field
of
science.
In
my
junior
year
of
high
school
I
was
assigned
my
first
major
term
paper.
It
was
supposed
to
be
at
least
fifteen
pages
in
length.
I
was
scared
to
death
and
although
we
had
almost
five
whole
months
to
do
the
assignment,
fear
kept
me
from
beginning
the
assignment
for
a
long
time.
The
assignment
was
based
on
a
famous
writer
and
I
struggled
about
who
I
should
choose.
My
teacher
pulled
me
aside
and
suggested
that
I
choose
Emily
Dickinson.
I
soon
began
to
read
Dickinson's
poems
and
fell
in
love
with
them.
During
the
research
for
my
paper
I
read
nearly
one
thousand
of
her
poems.
I
learned
to
make
a
concrete
outline
for
the
format
of
my
paper
which
aided
me
immensely.
I
was
astonished
at
the
fluidity
which
occurred
as
I
wrote
my
paper.
At
the
completion
of
the
paper
I
felt
that
I
had
accomplished
a
great
task
and
was
very
proud
of
myself.
My
senior
year
of
high
school
was
filled
with
a
great
deal
of
analysis
of
different
books,
which
I
thoroughly
enjoyed.
It
was
great
to
be
able
to
voice
my
own
opinions
on
what
I
felt
each
author
wanted
his/her
readers
to
gain
from
their
works.
We
read
plays
such
as
Waiting
for
Godot,
which
could
be
interpreted
in
infinite
ways.
I
loved
comparing
my
ideas
on
these
works
of
literature
to
those
ideas
of
my
classmates.
I
found
that
each
piece
of
literature
was
like
a
puzzle
which
could
be
solved
in
any
number
of
ways
depending
on
who
was
attempting
to
solve
it.
As
I
came
to
Lafayette
I
found
that
I
was
prepared
for
the
college
writing
experience.
My
First
Year
Writing
Course
proved
to
be
the
most
interesting
writing
course
I
had
ever
taken.
This
course
on
morality
allowed
everyone
in
the
class
to
not
only
express
their
opinions
but
also
prove
their
opinions.
I
was
thrilled
to
be
able
to
write
papers
in
which
I
not
only
expressed
my
opinion
but
was
able
to
back
up
my
opinion
through
clear,
concise,
and
intriguing
argument.
The
immense
writing
assignments
at
college
also
taught
me
that
computers
could
no
longer
be
ignored.
I
taught
myself
how
to
use
word
perfect
and
am
amazed
by
how
much
easier
the
whole
writing
process
has
become.
It
would
have
been
impossible
for
me
to
remember
every
experience
which
shaped
me
into
the
writer
I
have
become
today.
But
I
feel
that
the
experiences
I
have
discussed
in
this
paper
played
the
most
important
roles
in
shaping
my
attitude
and
outlook
on
writing.
I
hope
that
by
the
time
I
finish
my
college
experience
there
will
be
many
more
pages
to
be
written
about
how
my
experiences
at
college
shaped
my
outlook
on
writing
and
the
English
language.
