I
donOt
really
remember
my
exact,
first
instance
with
writing.
I
do
know,
however,
that
it
didnOt
involve
writing
D
the
physical
act
of
writing
that
is.
Even
as
a
young
child,
I
had
the
extra
attention
to
detail
that
comes
in
handy
with
writing,
so
I
suppose
you
could
call
my
Nplay
timeO
also
Nwriting
time.O
At
the
age
of
four
or
five,
I
would
write
when
I
basically
had
nothing
to
do.
Inspired
by
my
favorite
television
program,
Mister
RogersO
Neighborhood
D
and
documented
on
BETA
home
video
D
I
would
recreate
the
show
in
our
basement
with
special
attention
to
procedure
and
presentation.
In
other
words,
although
the
set
consisted
solely
of
an
orange
plastic
play
bench
and
an
empty
round
hard
candy
container,
I
was
conscious
to
the
accuracy
of
the
showOs
content.
No
show
could
be
started
without
the
song,
NWonOt
You
Be
My
Neighbor,O
and
no
show
could
end
without
the
NitOs
such
a
good
feelingO
song.
And,
of
course,
I
included
a
trip
to
the
NLand
of
Make
Believe.O
However,
since
I
was
playing
Mr.
Rogers
and
since
he
was
never
in
the
NLand
of
Make
Believe,O
I
sat
patiently
during
this
segment,
allowing
a
chunk
of
time
to
pass
D
under
the
assumption
that
this
was
also
what
Mr.
Rogers
did
while
NMake
BelieveO
was
going
on.
Although
the
writing
was
not
original
at
the
time,
I
was
adapting
it
to
myself,
following
a
structure,
leading
my
audience.
I
took
an
analytical
approach
in
my
viewing
of
the
show,
seeing
what
held
it
together
and
then
replicating
it
in
the
closest
way
possible.
It
didnOt
matter
that
the
surroundings
looked
nothing
like
the
real
show;
as
long
as
my
script
included
the
framework,
in
my
mind,
what
I
had
was
a
TV
show.
I
hit
the
key
points
in
the
show
just
like
how
today
I
hit
the
key
points
in
my
papers.
I
let
the
NMake
BelieveO
time
speak
for
itself
D
even
though
it
didnOt
exist
D
in
the
same
way
that
I
let
my
textual
support
speak
for
itself,
while
incorporating
it
into
my
overall
work.
I
suppose
my
thesis
was
that
Mr.
RogersO
friendly
demeanor,
welcoming
attitude,
and
personal
touch
were
things
that
all
people
could
exude,
even
without
the
added
luxury
of
a
set,
production
studio,
and
notable
guests.
As
I
got
older,
I
remember
playing
with
LEGOs,
letting
my
imagination
go
wild,
creating
vehicles
that
could
fly,
swim,
and
travel
through
time.
Once
the
creating
was
done,
however,
I
was
faced
with
the
task
of
playing
with
them.
Now
for
some,
this
may
seem
to
be
the
easy
part.
Let
me
assure
you,
it
certainly
was
not.
I
had
to
create
a
story,
one
that
made
sense,
one
that
would
challenge
the
characters,
but
not
be
too
far-fetched.
It
bothered
me
to
just
run
around
and
fly
my
toys;
there
had
to
be
some
reason,
some
mission
scenario
that
challenged
them
and
me.
I
didnOt
want
my
NheroO
character
to
have
an
easy
win.
So,
before
playing,
or
in
the
middle
of
playing,
I
would
have
to
stop
and
plan
it
out
D
write
D
what
would
make
it
difficult
enough
so
that
it
was
exciting,
but
not
so
hard
that
it
was
impossible.
This
attention
to
specifics
and
detail
still
contributes
to
how
I
analyze
the
world
and
how
I
write.
There
were
many
significant
events
in
my
learning,
reading,
and
writing
in
the
next
few
years.
However,
I
donOt
remember
those
parts
of
my
life.
What
I
do
remember
next
is
from
third
grade.
I
have
no
idea
what
the
assignment
was
about
and
I
donOt
really
know
what
the
story
was
about,
either.
I
think
it
had
something
to
do
with
using
similes
and
metaphors
in
a
short
story.
Anyway,
the
part
that
makes
this
instance
stick
in
my
mind
is
that
I
did
it
so
well
that
my
teacher
insisted
on
me
presenting
it
to
her
other
class.
That
made
me
feel
good
because
I
knew
that
someone
definitely
liked
it,
but
at
the
same
time,
I
was
apprehensive
because
the
other
kids
might
not.
Little
did
I
know,
but
I
was
learning
several
major
lessons
in
writing.
First,
you
open
yourself
up
to
criticism,
mocking,
or
indifference;
you
inherently
put
your
inner
beliefs,
ideas,
and
personality
into
a
written
work.
Second,
you
must
write
to
your
audience
D
to
the
people
who
will
listen
D
but
you
must
do
it
well
and
thoroughly
in
order
to
gain
their
support.
Finally,
and
most
suitably
applicable
in
this
case,
sharing
writing
among
peers
is
helpful
for
everyone.
In
the
next
few
years
of
elementary
school,
I
would
continue
to
write,
not
really
realizing
that
that
was
indeed
what
I
was
doing.
I
saw
it
more
as
putting
my
imagination
on
paper.
At
school
I
did
stories
for
assignments
and
at
home
I
wrote
several
comic
strips
for
fun.
In
fifth
grade,
however,
my
writing
reached
a
new
level;
as
part
of
our
gifted
programOs
activities,
three
or
four
of
my
fellow
students
and
I
wrote
a
play
which
we
then
produced
for
the
school.
In
retrospect,
I
am
amazed
that
we
worked
on
such
a
big
undertaking.
The
plot
was
based
on
an
idea
that
I
had
about
an
evil
man
who
was
slowly
destroying
all
of
the
fairytale
characters
by
shredding
their
books.
This
was
a
significant
project
in
the
development
of
my
writing,
mainly
because
it
was
one
of
the
first
times
when
I
really
had
to
work
with
others,
discuss
our
approaches,
and
fulfill
many
of
the
necessary
elements
of
a
story.
The
play
also
marked
a
change
that
I
notice
now
but
didnOt
notice
then.
I
think,
at
that
point,
I
thought
I
was
writing
for
real
and
not
just
pretending
to.
Now
I
know
that
all
of
my
writing
endeavors,
on
paper
or
in
my
mind,
were
most
definitely
for
Nreal.O
The
change
between
elementary
school
and
junior
high,
between
sixth
and
seventh
grade
marked
a
change
in
my
writing.
Because
we
were
older,
more
mature,
and
trying
to
hide
any
childish
aspects
of
ourselves,
the
NkiddieO
creative
projects
became
less
frequent.
In
my
attempt
to
continue
writing
in
my
new
environment,
I
joined
the
junior
high
newspaper.
For
three
years,
I
was
a
reporter,
reviewer,
and
a
sports
writer.
I
experienced
many
different
styles
of
writing,
each
evoking
a
different
feeling.
At
first,
the
pride
came
from
seeing
my
name
on
the
page,
but
as
I
got
older
and
was
able
to
choose
my
assignments
more,
the
pride
was
from
my
work.
The
change
from
ninth
grade
to
tenth
grade
was
extreme.
We
went
from
a
very
loose,
but
good
teaching
style
to
a
very
strict
and
demanding
one.
No
one
knew
what
to
do;
the
teacher
expected
so
much
but
didnOt
explain
anything.
It
was
as
if
we
had
to
figure
it
all
out
for
ourselves.
I
worked
harder
that
year
than
I
had
ever
before.
However,
no
matter
what
I
did,
all
of
my
essays
would
come
back,
covered
in
red,
with
a
stapled
grading
rubric,
which
inevitably
ended
with
N30/50.O
It
wasnOt
just
me;
everyone
was
having
trouble.
At
lunch
time,
right
before
class,
everyone
would
complain
and
we
shared
in
a
collective
sympathy
and
pity
for
ourselves.
The
extremity
of
this
situation
D
the
difficulty
of
the
class
and
the
lack
of
guidance
D
achieved
an
interesting
result.
It
separated
our
class
into
the
capable
people
who
had
given
up
trying
and
the
capable
people
who
continued
to
fight
and
work
harder
than
before.
I
was
one
of
the
latter.
We
received
an
assignment
for
a
descriptive
essay
one
day,
from
a
substitute.
All
of
us
told
the
substitute
that
we
had
not
discussed
the
assignment
and
had
no
clue
what
to
do.
With
boiling
frustration
from
the
assignment,
the
lack
of
overall
guidance
and
explanation,
and
continuing
low
grades
on
papers,
I
began
writing
the
essay.
How
was
I
expected
to
perform
well
if
our
teacher
refused
to
tell
us
how
to
write?
With
no
help
from
our
teacher,
I
sought
external
inspiration.
I
wrote
about
van
GoghOs
The
Starry
Night
D
the
celestial
majesty
of
the
stars
and
the
otherworldly,
omnipresent
blues
of
the
sky.
After
working
and
working,
perfecting
the
description,
determined
to
ace
the
assignment,
I
was
finally
done
and
ready
to
turn
it
in.
Upon
arriving
at
school,
I
learned
that
the
project
which
I
had
worked
on
for
so
long
was
worth
the
same
amount
of
points
as
a
mere
vocabulary
quiz.
Disappointed
and
set
back,
I
handed
the
paper
in.
With
the
returned
and
graded
assignment,
however,
I
demonstrated
one
of
those
third
grade
principles.
I
had
gotten
a
perfect
20/20
and
I
did
it
by
working
hard
to
gain
support
from
my
audience
D
my
teacher.
Suddenly,
the
grade
didnOt
matter;
what
mattered
was
that
I
had
won.
I
fought
and
for
my
efforts,
I
had
gotten
the
grade,
and
the
added
bonus
of
pride
in
myself
and
my
writing.
I
persisted
in
challenging
myself
for
the
rest
of
the
year,
yet
when
our
final
assignment
was
beginning
D
our
big,
scary
comprehensive
research
paper
D
I
was
still
intimidated.
But
as
I
had
learned,
I
just
worked
all
the
harder
to
compensate.
This
was
a
significant
point
in
my
writing
because
it
was
the
first
time
that
I
really
had
to
use
a
thesis
and
support
it
thoroughly
with
multiple
sources
of
evidence.
I
have
a
tendency,
in
my
intimidation,
to
complicate
my
thesis
and
subpoint
ideas,
but
throughout
the
course
of
writing
this
assignment,
I
learned
the
beauty
of
simplicity
and
structure
in
a
formal
paper.
Supporting
a
thesis
was
difficult
at
first
because
every
English
teacher
always
referred
to
it
as
NprovingO
your
thesis.
However,
as
soon
as
I
left
English
class
and
would
go
to
science,
the
teacher
would
say
the
very
opposite
statement
D
that
nothing
can
be
proven,
only
demonstrated
repeatedly.
Although
I
am
not
a
science
lover,
in
this
case
I
think
they
have
the
right
idea.
Instead
of
NprovingO
a
thesis,
what
writers
are
essentially
doing
is
simply
demonstrating
with
repeated
examples
why
their
thesis
makes
sense.
Understanding
that
concept
in
writing
helped
me
break
down
the
complexity
and
of
trying
to
accomplish
the
monumental
task
of
proving
my
thesis.
In
English,
unlike
science,
there
is
no
right
answer;
we
all
can
have
different
opinions.
The
only
way
to
level
the
ground,
then,
is
to
demonstrate
your
thought
process
with
examples.
Two
theses
can
exist
that
contradict
each
other,
yet
still
can
stand
firm
in
Nproof.O
After
all,
thatOs
what
politics
is
all
about:
two
differing
opinions
which
still
have
validity
because
of
the
arguments
and
examples
that
the
politicians
present.
For
tenth
graders,
proof
implies
something
overwhelming,
like
NprovingO
that
the
earth
is
round.
I
decided
this
on
my
own,
without
my
teacher;
in
an
odd
way,
though,
I
think
that
helped
me
as
a
writer,
because
now
I
understand
what
makes
a
paper
work.
I
continued
with
the
newspaper
in
tenth
grade
and
then
in
eleventh
and
twelfth
as
the
co-editor.
My
favorite
literary
jobs
were
writing
reviews
and
editorials.
Unlike
in
junior
high,
we
didnOt
have
conferences
with
the
writers,
so
the
editing
was
less
interesting
and
helpful.
What
I
liked
about
the
pieces
that
expressed
my
opinion
was
that
they
detracted
from
the
rigid
necessity
of
a
thesis
paper.
They
allowed
me
to
formulate
my
own
ideas
and
represent
my
feelings.
Additionally,
my
creativity
as
a
writer
expanded;
in
order
to
convey
the
effect
of
a
movie
on
me,
IOd
have
to
convert
the
visual
emotion
into
words.
With
the
editorials,
I
suffered
the
worst
writersO
block
I
had
in
all
of
high
school.
Sometimes
they
would
force
me
to
think
more,
with
an
end
result
that
impressed
me.
On
the
other
hand,
instead
of
forcing
me
to
think,
sometimes
they
would
end
up
simply
forced.
Basically,
I
discovered
that
when
I
am
enthusiastic,
learned,
and
opinionated
about
my
subject,
my
work
reflects
it
positively.
Although
it
seems
to
be
a
simple
concept,
it
served
me
well
as
I
progressed
through
school
and
combined
the
concepts
of
opinion
writing
with
thesis
writing.
Believing
in
my
theses
and
wanting
people
to
understand
pushes
me
to
write
more
clearly
and
effectively
so
that
I
assist
readers
to
see
my
point
of
view.
While
both
eleventh
and
twelfth
grades
were
considerably
influential
in
the
maturation
of
my
writing
skills,
this
stemmed
mostly
from
consistent
experiences
with
writing
and
help
from
my
teachers.
In
other
words,
they
were
years
of
slow
refinement,
instead
of
many
major
breakthroughs.
However,
in
eleventh
grade
after
much
hesitation,
I
came
to
accept
the
ideas
of
symbolism
and
deep
analysis
in
writing.
For
the
longest
time,
I
could
not
believe
all
of
the
aspects
of
the
novels
that
we
deconstructed.
I
did
not
understand
how
writers
could
construct
on
the
seemingly
coincidental
multiple
layers,
no
matter
how
smart
they
were.
While
I
still
donOt
really
understand
how
some
writers
manage
to
write
on
so
many
levels,
what
I
do
understand
now
is
that
everything
in
the
story
does
not
have
to
be
intentional,
nor
does
it
mean
that
it
is
by
accident.
After
studying
several
works
of
Dr.
Seuss
in
an
independent
research
project,
I
saw
that
they
were
packed
with
multiple
levels
of
imagery,
symbolism,
and
theme.
I
realized
that
while
some
of
what
he
wrote
was
intentional,
I
also
understood
that
the
human
subconscious
is
much
more
powerful
than
I
gave
it
credit
for.
Writers,
through
their
experiences
in
life
and
their
viewpoints,
can
inadvertently
influence
their
works
with
the
simple
choices
in
a
book
D
colors,
descriptions,
objects
D
in
the
same
way
that
journalists
unintentionally
bias
their
reports.
Recently,
through
my
experiences
as
a
freshman,
I
have
added
to
this
conclusion
that
authorial
intention
is
not
necessarily
the
end-all
interpretation;
for,
if
a
group
of
words
makes
you
feel
or
think
something
D
something
that
the
author
never
intended
D
then
that
interpretation
is
true
as
the
interpretation
the
author
intended.
If
the
authorOs
words
inspired
your
unique
interpretation,
then
itOs
yours;
not
even
he
can
take
it
away
even
if
it
is
supposed
to
mean
something
else.
As
a
freshman,
I
found
myself
doing
things
in
writing
that
I
never
expected
to
be
doing.
For
example,
every
time
I
had
a
paper
to
do,
I
inevitably
began
overwhelmed,
then
inspired,
then
learned,
but
when
it
came
time
to
put
it
on
the
page
in
words,
I
reverted
back
to
overwhelmed.
While
I
hated
them
in
high
school,
I
discovered
that
the
best
way
to
relieve
my
troubles
and
to
better
the
structure
of
the
paper
was
to
formulate
my
ideas
and
support
into
an
outline.
I
worked
on
trying
to
make
the
paper
truly
convey
my
mindOs
eye;
the
best
way
to
do
this
as
far
as
I
could
see,
was
to
lead
the
reader
through
the
points
in
the
same
way
that
I
had
found
the
thesis
to
be
true
to
me.
With
an
outline,
this
linear
structure
and
delicate
progression
became
much
easier.
In
another
way,
unrelated
to
any
assignment,
I
wanted
my
words
to
be
true
representatives
of
my
feelings.
I
tried
to
capture
the
emotions
of
my
college
experience
into
words.
To
do
this,
I
resorted
to
poetry,
a
literary
form
that
I
have
always
disliked.
However,
I
grew
to
like
writing
it
myself
because
it
allowed
me
to
break
down
the
sporadic,
impulsive
thoughts
and
feelings
I
would
have
in
class
or
at
home,
and
truly
understand
them.
Poetry
helped
me
make
sense
of
my
seemingly
irrational
emotions
and
views.
And
now
I
do
have
a
respect
for
poetry;
it
acts
as
a
photograph
of
your
soul,
showing
you
what
you
felt
inside
and
why.
Poetry
conveys
this
to
the
author,
as
in
my
case,
but
if
it
can
convey
a
persons
soul
to
a
mass
audience,
then
thatOs
what
makes
it
great.
And
in
the
end,
like
poetry,
IOve
found
that
what
makes
a
writing
great
is
its
ability
to
act
as
a
stand-in
for
the
author.
With
writing,
I
can
dissect
my
thoughts,
organize
them,
and
present
them
in
ways
that
are
considerably
more
influential
than
impromptu
speech.
Regardless
of
whether
you
are
outgoing
or
shy,
stutter
or
swoon,
writing
brings
us
to
the
same
playing
field,
at
which
point
our
true
intelligence
and
our
true
outlooks
show
through.
As
our
writing
changes
through
the
years,
it
simultaneously
serves
as
a
snapshot
of
ourselves
at
the
time
of
its
creation.
