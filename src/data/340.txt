In
these
fast
paced
times,
it
might
be
easy
to
overlook
the
importance
of
a
child's
bedtime
story.
One
might
fail
to
see
the
importance
of
such
a
simple
activity
yet
it
can
be
vital
to
a
young
writer.
My
experience
as
a
writer
began
with
stories
that
started
out
"once
upon
a
time"
and
ended
"happily
ever
after."
As
a
little
girl,
I
listened
attentively
as
my
parents
read
me
countless
fairytales
and
nursery
rhymes.
I
followed
along
with
the
words
as
they
read
until
the
day
when
I
could
read
myself.
Reading
opened
up
a
whole
new
world
for
me.
Every
week,
my
younger
sister
and
I
went
with
our
parents
to
what
we
believed
to
be
the
most
fascinating,
magical
place
on
earth,
the
library.
We
would
spend
hours
browsing
every
shelf,
even
if
it
meant
enlisting
the
help
of
a
grown
up.
By
the
time
we
finished,
we
had
more
books
than
we
could
carry
on
our
own.
Every
week
the
librarian
politely
informed
us
that
it
was
impossible
to
finish
that
many
books
in
such
a
short
period
of
time.
When
we
came
back
the
next
week
to
return
them,
however,
she
was
always
amazed
that
two
little
girls
could
retain
enough
interest
in
the
books
they
selected
to
finish
them
all.
Out
of
this
interest
in
reading,
grew
my
love
of
writing.
Before
I
could
manage
to
scribble
more
than
my
name
on
a
piece
of
paper,
I
became
a
writer.
Though
I
could
not
physically
write
yet,
I
dreamt
up
elaborate
stories
in
my
head,
drew
them
on
paper
and
acted
them
out.
I
imagined
stories
in
my
head,
even
thinking
of
the
perfect
words
to
use
to
get
my
ideas
across.
Frustration
would
actually
come
later
on
when
I
would
be
unable
to
spell
all
of
the
words
in
my
growing
vocabulary.
To
myself,
I
would
even
narrate
my
own
actions
and
the
actions
of
those
around
me
as
if
I
was
telling
the
story
of
a
day
in
my
life.
Once
I
learned
to
spell
and
create
the
correct
formation
of
letters
and
words,
I
was
elated.
I
would
write
with
anything
I
could
get
my
hands
on.
I
loved
crayons,
markers,
and
pencils,
especially
anything
colorful.
My
earliest
writings
came
with
drawings
that
I
believed
would
best
convey
my
ideas
to
my
audience,
typically
my
family.
I
usually
wrote
very
short
stories
that
I
gave
to
my
parents
and
sister
as
gifts.
One
of
my
mother's
favorite
souvenirs
from
my
year
in
kindergarten
is
a
short
story
I
wrote
on
a
piece
of
wide
ruled
paper
bordered
by
blue
construction
paper.
Though
it
was
not
very
decorative
and
was
only
written
in
pencil
in
my
juvenile
handwriting,
it
expressed
my
gratitude
to
my
parents
for
providing
for
me
and
taking
very
good
care
of
me.
This
kind
of
writing
was
introduced
to
me
in
school
but
became
a
task
I
looked
forward
to
doing
on
my
own.
As
I
grew
older,
writing
assignments
became
more
involved
and
more
frequent
in
school.
By
the
end
of
the
second
grade,
my
first
book
report
was
due
and
by
the
third
grade,
reports
were
due
every
month.
Third
graders
were
faced
with
the
challenge
of
writing
reports
without
the
same
structure
as
in
the
second
grade.
The
previous
year,
students
were
given
a
form
to
fill
out
to
describe
the
book
they
read.
In
the
third
grade,
however,
students
could
use
any
format
they
liked
as
long
as
they
fulfilled
the
criteria,
characters,
setting,
and
plot.
These
instructions
allowed
me
to
utilize
my
creativity
in
a
format
that
suited
me
best;
first
describing
the
story
and
then
giving
my
own
opinion
on
the
book.
In
my
report
on
Run
Away
Ralph,
I
first
accurately
described
the
plot
of
a
small
mouse
who
had
adventures
on
a
little
red
motorcycle.
At
my
conclusion,
however,
I
shocked
the
teacher
by
saying
I
believed
the
book
was
so
bad,
it
would
have
been
better
if
Ralph
had
fallen
off
his
motorcycle
in
the
first
chapter
to
avoid
the
reader
the
agony
of
reading
the
rest
of
the
book.
Though
she
was
disappointed
that
I
did
not
enjoy
the
book,
my
teacher
praised
my
honesty
and
my
ability
to
support
my
opinion.
I
began
to
enjoy
this
kind
of
writing,
description
followed
by
analysis.
Analytical
reports
were
the
norm
by
fifth
and
sixth
grades.
Teachers
were
no
longer
concerned
with
the
plot
of
a
book.
They
wanted
to
hear
about
the
moral
of
each
story
and
the
reasons
behind
actions
and
events.
Suddenly
I
felt
like
an
investigative
reporter
who
scrutinizes
evidence
and
analyzes
facts.
I
read
books
not
simply
to
learn
of
a
new
story
but
also
to
find
the
meaning
behind
it.
My
favorite
genre
was
historical
fiction.
Reading
about
the
story
behind
the
story
fascinated
me.
I
began
to
delve
more
into
history
and
create
my
own
stories
based
on
actual
events.
I
also
liked
to
write
reports
on
books
with
symbolism
and
hidden
meanings.
In
the
seventh
grade,
I
read
George
Orwell's
Animal
Farm.
It
was
unlike
most
books
I
had
read
in
that
it
described
events
in
history,
my
favorite
subject,
without
mentioning
the
incidents
that
took
place
or
the
people
involved
in
them.
I
became
very
taken
with
symbolic
writing
and
began
to
write
my
own
stories
and
poems
using
this
style.
During
junior
high
school,
I
was
exposed
to
many
other
writing
styles
as
well.
I
frequently
wrote
research
papers
and
lab
reports
for
science
classes
and
numerous
history
papers.
A
lot
of
time
was
spent
in
class
explaining
these
writing
styles
but
more
time
was
spent
on
creative
writing
than
any
other
genre.
Time
in
English
class
was
often
allotted
for
free
writing
and
journal
writing.
The
teacher
collected
our
journals
so
everyone
in
the
class
was
sure
to
leave
any
thoughts
deemed
too
personal
out
of
the
writings.
When
I
got
home
from
school,
however,
I
would
put
entries
into
my
own
journal.
It
was
a
way
for
me
to
express
my
inner
most
feelings
without
concern
for
what
others
might
think
of
them.
It
was
a
valuable
resource
for
me
and
provided
me
with
a
creative
outlet.
Free
writing
in
English
class
consisted
of
more
than
journal
writing.
My
teacher
often
gave
us
a
topic
and
told
us
to
expand
on
it
as
creatively
as
possible.
In
the
assignment
I
liked
best,
my
task
was
to
describe
my
adventure
on
the
secret
island
of
Husha
Husha.
I
was
to
describe
how
I
got
there,
what
the
natives
were
like,
and
what
I
did
while
I
was
there.
By
this
time,
I
had
already
started
to
use
my
mother's
typewriter.
I
typed
out
every
thought
that
came
to
mind,
visualizing
the
island
as
if
I
had
really
been
there.
I
organized
my
thoughts
into
a
two
page,
single-spaced
paper
about
how
during
a
brief
sailing
expedition,
a
storm
came
up
and
shipwrecked
me
on
the
island.
I
was
befriended
by
a
monkey
and
an
elephant
who
helped
me
convince
the
natives
that
I
was
completely
harmless.
Like
all
the
stories
I
wrote
at
that
age,
it
ended
happily
ever
after.
My
teacher
raved
about
my
project
to
the
rest
of
the
class
and
I
received
an
A+.
I
enjoyed
that
writing
assignment
so
much
that
I
independently
wrote
a
sequel
to
the
story.
I
presented
it
to
my
teacher
who
was
impressed
that
I
wrote
an
entire
paper
without
being
assigned
to
do
so.
Throughout
the
rest
of
my
time
in
elementary
school,
I
composed
hundreds
of
writings.
I
still
have
countless
boxes
filled
with
poems,
short
stories,
biographies,
and
research
papers.
Going
through
these
papers,
I
found
what
I
remember
to
be
the
most
challenging
and
exciting
assignment
I
was
given
in
elementary
school.
This
single
assignment
reshaped
the
goals
and
aspirations
I
had
for
myself.
I
was
told
to
compile
a
newspaper,
complete
with
news,
sports,
weather,
and
an
opinion
section.
Though
the
stories
were
based
on
actual
news,
I
wrote
all
of
them.
I
got
more
satisfaction
out
of
this
assignment
than
out
of
any
one
I
had
ever
put
together.
Newspaper
writing
was
a
variation
of
the
writing
I
had
done
in
analytical
reports.
It
was
providing
a
detailed
account
of
events
by
giving
the
reader
an
accurate
description
of
what
had
happened
and
why.
It
allowed
me
to
utilize
my
writing
talent
to
convey
information
to
those
people
who
needed
or
wanted
to
hear
it.
I
knew
this
was
what
I
wanted
to
do.
I
joined
the
student
newspaper
and
the
yearbook
staffs
my
freshmen
year
of
high
school.
Despite
my
success
in
numerous
writing
assignments
in
high
school,
I
always
considered
my
newspaper
articles
to
be
my
greatest
achievements.
I
have
always
received
positive
feedback
on
my
writing.
From
the
amazement
of
family
members
who
read
my
independent
creations
to
the
praise
of
teachers
who
graded
my
papers,
I
was
consistently
recognized
for
my
writing
ability.
This
was
reinforced
by
the
numerous
classmates
who
approached
me
to
talk
about
paper
topics
or
wanted
me
to
check
their
grammar
or
spelling.
I
never
doubted
my
ability
as
a
writer,
even
through
the
transition
from
grammar
school
to
high
school.
As
the
workload
increased
and
papers
became
more
frequent,
I
began
to
write
with
more
ease
than
ever
before.
Each
night
I
wrote
a
one-page
history
paper
and
each
week
composed
a
short
essay
for
English
class.
Writing
so
often
forced
me
to
organize
my
papers
faster
and
more
effectively
than
ever
before.
Aided
by
a
growing
vocabulary
filled
with
"SAT
words,"
my
writing
became
more
mature
and
professional
than
it
had
in
the
past.
I
continued
to
write
on
my
own
though
not
with
the
frequency
I
had
before.
Occasionally
I
penned
short
stories
and
poems
if
time
permitted.
I
had
come
to
embrace
the
writing
I
did
in
history
and
English.
When
I
graduated
from
high
school,
I
was
completely
confident
in
my
writing
ability.
I
was
equipped
with
the
skills
I
acquired
from
my
Advanced
Placement
English
and
honors
history
classes.
I
was
excited
at
the
challenge
college
presented
and
eager
to
take
my
writing
to
the
next
level.
I
excelled
in
a
history
class
I
took
first
semester.
The
professor
gave
few
guides
lines
as
to
the
format
of
the
assigned
papers
and
I
felt
comfortable
making
use
of
my
newly
developing
style
of
writing.
I
received
positive
feedback
and
high
marks
on
all
my
papers.
My
dilemma
came
in
my
First
Year
Seminar
class.
As
I
was
trying
to
conform
to
the
style
of
writing
preferred
by
the
professor,
I
confronted
the
added
challenge
of
a
new
influence
on
my
writing.
Though
I
had
frequently
done
peer
editing
in
high
school,
I
was
not
used
to
these
new
conversation
sessions
with
the
class's
Writing
Associate.
I
was
under
the
impression,
as
many
of
the
students
in
the
class
were,
that
I
had
to
make
all
the
corrections
the
WA
proposed.
She
reformatted
my
entire
paper
and,
believing
she
knew
more
about
what
the
professor
wanted
than
I
did,
I
made
all
of
her
corrections.
Several
days
later,
I
handed
in
my
original
paper
along
with
the
paper
I
edited
after
my
WA
session.
The
edited
copy
was
my
final
draft.
When
the
paper
was
returned
to
me,
I
quickly
flipped
the
pages
to
the
back
to
find
a
large
red
B
and
the
professor's
disheartening
comments
below.
"Your
original
draft
was
better,"
he
wrote.
In
all
the
years
I
have
been
writing,
that
was
my
worst
experience,
not
because
of
the
grade
but
because
I
did
not
follow
my
writer's
instinct.
I
learned
a
valuable
lesson
from
my
first
experience
with
a
Writing
Associate:
each
person
should
write
with
a
style
that
best
suites
them.
Although
the
formatting
changes
may
have
been
appropriate
for
the
WA's
style,
they
were
not
right
for
mine.
I
also
learned
to
be
more
selective
in
the
changes
I
make
based
on
conversations
with
others.
Some
of
the
WA's
suggestions
would
have
added
to
my
paper
but
perhaps
not
all
of
them.
In
future
conferences
with
my
WA,
I
participated
more
in
an
active
conversation
about
my
paper.
I
did
not
assume
a
passive
role
as
I
had
before.
This
experience
enabled
me
to
better
assist
friends
who
came
to
me
for
help
with
their
papers.
I
realized
that
just
as
I
did
not
need
to
conform
to
someone
else's
writing
style,
they
did
not
need
to
conform
to
mine.
My
confidence
in
my
own
writing
was
elevated
most
by
my
experience
with
the
newspaper.
In
a
matter
of
months,
I
moved
from
reporter
to
assistant
news
editor
of
The
Lafayette.
I
watched
my
stories
move
from
the
inside
of
the
paper
to
the
front
page.
My
greatest
honor
was
the
assignment
to
cover
the
Pepper
Prize
winner,
the
privilege
given
to
the
paper's
most
promising
reporter.
Never
before
had
my
writing
been
read
and
praised
by
so
many
people.
This
past
summer,
I
interned
at
NBC
Nightly
News
and
gained
a
new
perspective
on
writing.
Television
writing
is
drastically
different
from
all
other
writing
I
have
been
exposed
to.
It
requires
the
writer
to
be
succinct
and
to
the
point
yet
highly
informative.
On
several
occasions,
I
observed
Mr.
Brokaw
and
many
senior
producers
compose
pieces
minutes
before
they
were
aired.
Though
my
academic
writing
does
not
require
the
same
sense
of
urgency,
my
experience
taught
me
the
value
of
being
clear
and
concise
while
catering
to
a
specific
audience.
Throughout
my
life,
my
writing
has
been
shaped
by
numerous
influences.
My
identity
as
a
writer
was
first
molded
by
the
stories
I
read
as
a
child
and
was
further
shaped
by
my
experiences
in
elementary
school.
When
I
discovered
newspaper
writing
I
was
awakened
to
a
new
form
of
expression
and
explored
that
form
further
during
my
internship
at
Nightly
News.
Today,
my
writing
style
continues
to
evolve.
I
am
confident
that
my
numerous
experiences
will
enable
me
to
relate
to
other
writers
and
help
them
to
enjoy
writing
as
much
as
I
do.
