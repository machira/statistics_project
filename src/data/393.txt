Literary
Narrative
Since
my
earliest
attempts
of
scrawling
out
the
four
letters
of
my
name,
writing
has
been
an
integral
part
of
my
personal
and
academic
lives.
I
have
always
found
written
word
to
be
the
most
effective
means
for
me
to
communicate
my
ideas,
because
it
allows
me
the
time
and
freedom
to
plan
my
thoughts
and
revise
and
clarify
them
as
needed.
I
believe
that
my
ongoing
growth
as
a
writer
can
be
attributed
to
a
combination
of
my
personal
interest
in
the
craft
and
the
encouragement
and
instruction
of
many
knowledgeable
instructors
along
the
way.
Nursery
School
laid
the
foundation
for
future
writing
endeavors
by
introducing
me
to
the
very
basic
elements
of
the
English
language.
With
crayons
and
pencils,
I
learned
how
to
carefully
construct
each
letter
of
the
alphabet
on
paper,
and
the
sounds
to
which
each
letter
corresponded.
While
this
may
not
be
considered
true
writing,
since
I
was
not
yet
able
to
use
these
individual
letters
to
express
ideas,
I
still
see
this
as
a
very
important
part
of
my
writing
history.
Every
great
piece
of
writing
is
only
possible
with
its
constituent
parts.
Letters
combine
to
make
words,
which
make
sentences,
paragraphs,
pages,
whole
works,
and
even
anthologies.
Any
written
composition
begins
with
the
tiny
arrangement
of
pencil
strokes
that
create
letters.
In
kindergarten,
I
began
to
use
my
knowledge
of
letters
to
attempt
to
create
whole
words.
Miss
MacElwee,
a
teacher
with
a
love
for
teddy
bears
and
story
telling,
taught
us
the
practice
of
Ncreative
spelling.O
Rather
than
writing
out
a
whole
word,
we
would
simply
write
the
first
letter
followed
by
a
squiggly
line
representing
the
mysterious
letter
sequence
that
followed.
Sometimes,
with
tricky
words
like
NphoneO
or
Nknife,O
I
would
even
get
the
first
letter
wrong,
but
it
was
still
a
good
start.
By
the
end
of
the
year,
we
were
learning
Ninventive
spellingO
which
required
us
to
use
our
knowledge
of
the
sounds
of
the
alphabet
to
attempt
to
spell
out
entire
words.
The
spellings
were
often
incorrect,
but
now
the
words
could
be
understood
by
any
reader
with
a
basic
knowledge
of
phonetics.
This
revelation
gave
my
writing
the
power
to
(somewhat)
effectively
express
whole
ideas
for
the
first
time.
My
prime
period
of
growth
as
a
young
writer
came
in
first
grade.
As
a
neuroscience
major,
I
could
attribute
this
to
theories
of
cognitive
development
that
name
ages
6-7
as
the
optimal
time
for
writing
skills
to
flourish.
Instead,
I
tend
to
give
much
of
the
credit
to
my
first
grade
teacher
Ms.
Schwiezer.
Ms.
Schwiezer
encouraged
me
to
write
more
than
any
other
teacher
I
have
ever
encountered.
She
especially
stressed
creative
story
writing,
which
I
loved.
By
this
time,
I
had
a
basic
understanding
of
grammatical
rules,
which
allowed
me
to
write
simple
sentences.
I
combined
these
sentences
to
create
countless
stories,
each
of
which
were
praised
by
Ms.
Schweizer,
which
further
encouraged
my
writing.
I
can
remember
being
especially
proud
of
my
longer
stories.
When
the
class
was
required
to
write
a
three
page
story,
I
delighted
in
expanding
mine
to
seven,
because
I
tended
to
judge
the
quality
of
my
work
on
its
length.
Granted,
the
paper
we
wrote
on
had
rows
of
widely
spaced
lines
with
a
dotted
one
between
them,
like
the
markings
of
a
passing
lane
on
a
two-lane
road.
Each
page
of
a
seven
page
paper
may
have
only
really
included
two
sentences,
which
is
probably
why
Ms.
Schweizer
didnOt
mind
reading
my
extra
pages,
and
often
commended
me
on
them.
With
her
encouragement,
I
decided
that
I
wanted
to
be
an
author
when
I
grew
up.
In
addition
to
creative
writing
in
school,
during
first
grade
I
began
to
explore
creative
writing
at
home,
in
my
free
time.
For
Christmas
that
year,
I
gave
stories
with
illustrations
as
gifts.
I
also
began
writing
poetry.
When
I
read
some
of
it
now,
I
laugh
at
the
simplicity
of
both
its
style
and
its
content,
but
I
see
it
as
the
beginning
of
an
interest
in
poetry
writing
that
continues
even
today.
Around
this
time,
I
also
received
my
first
diary,
which
began
my
interest
in
journaling.
I
can
remember
being
afraid
to
write
everything
I
was
feeling
in
complete
honesty
for
fear
that
my
nosey
older
brothers
might
find
the
sacred
book.
I
kept
the
topics
of
reflection
rather
light,
as
is
to
be
expected
of
a
first
grader.
As
I
grew
up,
and
found
better
hiding
places
for
my
diary,
I
became
more
comfortable
writing
out
all
of
my
thoughts
unabashedly
on
paper.
This
not
only
helped
me
to
sort
my
thoughts
and
relieve
stress,
but
it
familiarized
me
with
a
personal,
stream
of
consciousness
type
of
writing.
As
I
continued
in
my
schooling,
my
writing
expanded
from
creative
stories
to
other
genres.
I
began
to
learn
the
art
of
research
papers,
persuasive
essays,
and
personal
narratives.
At
the
same
time,
the
style
of
my
writing
began
to
improve.
I
was
extremely
fortunate
to
have
attended
Central
Bucks
School
District
outside
Philadelphia.
While
I
did
not
appreciate
it
at
the
time,
I
realize
now
that
my
district
really
stressed
the
importance
of
writing,
and
spent
a
lot
of
time
teaching
writing
skills.
Throughout
elementary
school,
I
was
taught
the
intricacies
of
grammar
rules
within
the
English
language.
We
performed
NDaily
EditsO
at
the
beginning
of
each
day,
during
which
we
would
look
at
sentences
on
the
board
and
correct
them
for
spelling,
grammar,
and
punctuation.
This
allowed
me
to
develop
a
keen
sense
of
the
mechanics
of
English.
I
often
take
this
skill
for
granted,
but
even
at
Lafayette
I
speak
with
friends
that
remark
that
they
donOt
understand
grammar
rules
at
all.
Some
of
my
most
intelligent
friends
donOt
know
where
to
place
a
comma
in
a
sentence.
This
makes
me
think
that
grammar
skills
are
a
direct
reflection
of
an
individualOs
schooling,
not
necessarily
their
intelligence.
Many
of
the
rules
of
English
are
not
intuitive
or
logical,
so
they
must
be
learned
through
practice
and
repetition.
I
feel
very
fortunate
to
have
had
such
practice,
because
it
continues
to
help
me
today.
The
culmination
of
my
early
writing
experience
was
the
sixth
grade
assessment.
My
school
district
passed
a
policy
just
before
I
got
to
sixth
grade
that
required
students
to
complete
an
assessment
in
order
to
graduate
to
middle
school.
We
were
given
one
day
to
research
a
topic
in
the
school
library,
write
a
research
paper,
and
prepare
an
oral
presentation
with
visual
aids
to
be
given
the
following
day.
I
chose
to
answer
the
question,
NWhat
is
the
anatomy
of
a
comet?O
I
can
still
remember
the
poster
I
made
with
each
part
of
the
comet
labeled
carefully.
I
can
still
remember
nervously
explaining
my
research
in
my
oral
presentation.
But
what
I
really
remember
is
getting
my
grade
back
for
the
paper
I
wrote.
Our
research
habits,
our
papers,
our
visuals,
and
our
oral
presentations
were
each
worth
six
points
for
a
total
of
24.
I
remember
doing
well
on
each
section,
except
for
my
paper,
for
which
I
received
only
two
out
of
six
points.
It
was
handed
back
to
me
covered
in
red
marks
and
comments.
My
paragraphs
lacked
topic
sentences
and
transitions.
My
thoughts
were
not
well
organized.
Having
received
mostly
praise
for
my
writing
throughout
Elementary
School,
I
was
shocked
that
I
had
done
so
poorly.
The
experience
made
me
realize
that
I
had
much
to
learn
about
writing.
Fortunately,
my
teachers
throughout
middle
school
and
high
school
continued
to
stress
writing
in
their
academic
curriculum.
I
continued
to
hone
my
skills
in
different
genres.
Research
papers
were
especially
stressed.
In
middle
school
I
received
my
first
copy
of
the
Central
Bucks
Writing
Manual,
which
gave
explicit
instructions
on
how
to
write
a
research
paper.
The
manual
was
similar
to
the
St.
MartinOs
handbook,
and
was
updated
every
year
to
keep
our
writing
styles
current.
We
were
required
to
keep
note
cards
labeled
with
the
author,
page
number,
and
topic.
Each
note
card
was
to
have
only
one
fact
written
on
it,
so
that
they
could
be
arranged
to
create
a
flowing
paper.
I
detested
this
process
because
it
seemed
like
a
waste
of
paper
and
a
waste
of
time.
Still,
it
taught
me
the
importance
of
organizing
your
research
and
keeping
information
with
its
source.
We
were
always
taught
to
cite
our
work,
which
seemed
tedious
at
times,
but
now
at
the
college
level,
when
plagiarism
is
a
very
serious
offense,
I
am
thankful
that
my
earlier
schooling
instilled
good
research
habits
in
me.
By
high
school,
I
had
been
introduced
to
most
genres
of
writing.
Writing
was
not
just
a
subject
in
itself,
but
an
integral
part
of
any
class.
While
my
love
of
writing
endured,
I
began
to
become
more
interested
in
the
sciences,
and
so
my
childhood
dream
of
becoming
an
author
faded.
Still,
I
knew
that
writing
would
be
important
in
any
field
that
I
entered.
By
this
point,
I
had
begun
to
prefer
more
academic
style
writing
instead
of
creative
stories.
I
loved
being
able
to
craft
eloquent
arguments
on
paper,
and
I
found
that
my
voice
was
the
strongest
not
when
I
spoke,
but
when
I
wrote
my
thoughts
down.
Often,
when
I
speak,
my
mouth
moves
too
fast
for
my
mind
to
keep
up,
and
so
I
find
myself
having
to
pause
or
insert
an
NumO
or
NlikeO
to
allow
my
thoughts
to
catch
up.
On
paper,
this
has
never
been
a
problem
because
my
hands
seem
to
move
at
the
same
speed
as
my
mind.
When
I
do
botch
words
on
paper,
wonderful
inventions
like
erasers,
white
out,
and
delete
buttons
allow
me
to
change
and
clarify
my
messages.
Unfortunately,
in
high
school,
I
did
not
always
take
advantage
of
the
ability
to
revise
writing.
I
had
always
been
able
to
crank
out
a
paper
quickly
and
hand
it
in
for
a
good
grade,
so
revision
never
seemed
necessary.
This
all
changed
with
two
teachers
in
high
school.
The
first
was
Mrs.
Saft,
my
American
Literature
teacher.
It
was
clear
from
the
first
day
of
her
class
that
she
was
different
than
most
other
English
teachers
I
had
encountered.
When
a
student
asked
how
long
our
first
paper
should
be,
she
replied,
NLike
a
good
miniskirtNlong
enough
to
cover
everything
but
short
enough
to
keep
it
interesting.O
For
my
first
assignment
in
her
class,
I
produced
a
five
paragraph
essay
about
what
it
means
to
an
American,
which,
by
every
other
teacherOs
standards,
would
have
been
an
A
paper.
She
handed
it
back
to
me
marked
with
a
C.
Fortunately,
she
was
a
strong
advocate
of
revision.
We
were
allowed
to
meet
with
her
to
discuss
each
of
our
papers,
and
could
rewrite
any
of
them
to
receive
a
new
grade
as
many
times
as
we
wanted
until
we
were
satisfied.
I
took
advantage
of
this
for
many
of
my
papers,
revising
them
with
her
help
until
we
were
both
satisfied
with
them.
I
learned
that
even
a
good
paper
can
be
improved
greatly
through
revision.
In
twelfth
grade,
my
AP
English
professor,
Mr.
Trachtenburg,
continued
to
challenge
me
as
a
writer
and
prepared
me
for
college
level
writing.
The
course
was
a
college
level
English
literature
class,
so
I
knew
the
workload
would
be
demanding.
In
addition,
Mr.
Trachtenburg
presented
more
intellectual
challenge
than
any
teacher
I
had
before
him.
A
recent
graduate
of
Yale,
he
was
respected
by
faculty
and
students
alike
for
his
knowledge
of
literature
and
writing.
He,
too,
stressed
the
importance
of
revision,
but
he
encouraged
students
to
revise
on
their
own
before
they
handed
papers
in.
It
was
an
advanced
class,
and
he
knew
that
many
of
us
were
used
to
writing
an
A
paper
in
a
few
hours
the
night
before
it
was
due.
He
warned
us
that
this
would
not
suffice
in
his
class
or
in
college.
I
realized
throughout
my
senior
year
that
he
was
right.
He
expected
more
out
of
me
than
any
other
teacher,
and
as
I
result
I
was
forced
to
work
in
advance,
drafting,
writing,
and
revising
papers
before
I
even
thought
about
handing
them
in.
This
was
the
only
way
to
succeed
in
his
class.
I
looked
forward
to
college
with
the
lessons
of
many
of
my
past
teachers
kept
in
the
back
of
mind.
I
kept
not
only
the
skills
they
had
taught
me
in
mind,
but
the
advice
regarding
planning
ahead
and
revising
your
writing.
The
stories
of
my
older
brotherOs
academic
experiences
also
encouraged
me.
He
told
me
he
didnOt
realize
how
lucky
he
was
to
have
learned
how
to
write
in
a
school
district
like
ours
until
he
got
to
college
and
saw
how
other
people
from
all
over
the
country
wrote.
Now
perhaps
he
saw
such
poor
writing
because
he
attended
Lehigh
University,
but
I
really
think
that
at
any
college
there
is
a
wide
range
of
writing
skill
level
in
the
freshman
class,
because
people
are
coming
from
very
different
backgrounds.
Even
at
a
highly
competitive
school
like
Lafayette,
students
arrive
with
varying
degrees
of
proficiency
with
the
English
language.
My
classes
at
Lafayette
thus
far
have
shown
me
that
while
I
was
prepared
for
college
writing
by
the
lessons
of
my
teachers
in
high
school,
there
is
still
much
to
learn.
While
I
had
thought
that
I
was
familiar
with
most
genres
of
writing,
I
learned
many
more
facets
of
writing
when
I
came
to
college.
The
standard
five-paragraph
essay
that
I
used
throughout
high
school
for
almost
every
class
does
not
always
suffice
in
my
college
courses.
Instead,
I
have
found
that
I
must
shift
my
writing
style
slightly
to
accommodate
each
of
my
classes.
As
a
neuroscience
major,
I
have
become
all
too
familiar
with
the
writing
of
laboratory
reports.
Even
within
this
category,
I
must
write
very
differently
for
a
biology
report
versus
a
psychology
report.
Each
has
its
own
accepted
stylistic
and
organizational
nuances.
When
I
took
a
philosophy
class
this
year,
I
had
to
learn
an
entirely
new
genre
of
writing
to
which
I
had
never
been
exposed.
Philosophical
writing,
with
its
presentation
of
arguments
and
defenses
and
its
very
specific
language,
was
different
and
extremely
challenging
at
first.
With
each
class
that
I
take,
I
find
that
the
same
tool,
writing,
can
be
molded
to
serve
a
multitude
of
purposes.
I
look
forward
to
further
improving
my
writing
as
I
continue
my
academic
career.
By
pursuing
a
minor
in
English,
I
have
been
able
to
learn
more
about
the
craft
of
writing
in
the
classroom.
In
addition,
each
of
my
other
classes
allows
me
to
practice
a
variety
of
applications
of
my
writing
frequently.
I
am
thankful
that
my
love
of
writing
has
stayed
with
me
since
my
early
years,
because
it
has
helped
me
in
every
one
of
my
classes,
and
I
know
it
will
continue
to
help
me
communicate
my
ideas
effectively
throughout
any
career
that
I
pursue
in
the
future.
