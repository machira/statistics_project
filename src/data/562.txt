My
experiences
as
I
writer
I
was
a
little
child
when
I
used
to
see
my
father
signing
documents
and
letters.
I
think
his
signature
caught
my
attention
and,
along
with
beetle
Volkswagens,
it
was
my
first
attempt
to
draw.
I
was
very
successful
at
drawing
cars,
but
it
took
a
bit
longer
to
learn
how
to
draw
letters
and,
therefore,
to
write.
First
grade
at
elementary
school
meant
for
me
the
opportunity
to
learn
how
to
write
and
read.
However,
I
had
to
wait
six
long
months
doing
tiring
calligraphy
exercises.
So,
after
that
long
time,
I
was
finally
in
front
of
my
writing
book
with
a
pencil
ready
to
learn
how
to
write
and
read.
So,
as
time
passed,
I
learned
to
write
very
basic
phrases
and
sentences.
Nevertheless,
my
grandfather
used
to
force
me
to
write
more
complex
sentences,
so
I
started
using
nouns
and
verbs
that
I
only
learned
by
the
books
he
read
to
me.
Even
if
I
was
able
to
write,
I
had
a
new
challenge,
I
wanted
to
use
a
pen.
In
my
elementary
school,
students
needed
special
permission
to
use
pen.
It
was
a
crucial
time
for
us,
because
writing
with
a
pen
meant
that
we
were
responsible
enough
not
to
make
mistakes.
However,
my
excitement
about
pens
only
lasted
for
a
year,
because
in
1997
I
had
a
new
goal
to
reach,
my
grandfatherOs
typewriter.
Computers
came
later
and
my
experience
with
the
old
typewriter
helped
me
typing.
Nevertheless,
my
writing
skills
improved
only
in
secondary
school.
When
I
first
entered
secondary
school
the
writing
program
totally
changed
for
me.
My
teacher
stressed
much
more
the
grammar
and
spelling
side
of
the
Spanish
course.
She
was
very
focused
on
grammar
structures
and
the
right
way
to
write
in
Spanish.
At
that
time,
I
did
not
enjoy
that
class
because
of
the
tedious
rules;
however,
my
Spanish
improved.
In
the
mean
time
I
also
started
to
read
on
my
own.
The
first
book
that
totally
caught
my
attention
was
NA
Hundred
years
of
solitudeO
by
Gabriel
Garca
Mrquez.
That
was
probably
the
first
novel
I
decided
to
read
for
pleasure.
Since
that
moment
my
experience
as
reader
and
writer
absolutely
changed.
Before
reading
that
book
I
was
only
interested
on
literature
and
writing
for
my
school
courses.
However,
that
book
left
me
a
feeling
that
writing
could
also
be
interactive,
that
as
a
reader
I
had
the
opportunity
to
confront
my
ideas
with
the
author.
Later,
I
wrote
brief
responses
to
some
excerpts
from
that
book
for
my
literature
class.
Then,
I
discovered
I
enjoyed
being
active
in
a
literary
discussion
and
started
being
more
argumentative.
Soon,
we
learned
how
to
write
essays
and
were
asked
to
write
critical
papers.
In
that
sense,
I
had
as
much
trouble
as
my
fellow
partners.
It
was
the
first
time
we
were
asked
to
write
argumentative
texts
about
historical
facts.
Indeed,
I
found
that
my
previous
experience
on
grammar
was
very
useful
for
me
because
that
gave
me
a
basis
to
organize
my
ideas
in
a
logic
way.
However,
we
were
even
more
encouraged
and
forced
to
write
only
argumentative
documents
in
the
last
years
of
secondary
school
in
Peru.
In
2003
we
had
a
Social
Sciences
teacher
whom
gave
countless
sheets
of
paper
about
history,
essays
and
other
academic
documents.
We
were
asked
to
analyze
them
and
write
papers
on
them.
I
used
that
opportunity
to
learn
to
extract
the
fundamental
points
in
a
text
and
write
new
texts
with
those
resources.
In
fact,
my
vocabulary
grew
and
my
critical
thinking
improved
too.
That
teacher
was
very
strict
so
it
was
not
possible
to
obtain
good
marks
with
a
mediocre
essay.
However,
I
felt
that
creativity
was
not
encouraged
enough
in
my
old
secondary
school.
We
never
had
workshops
about
free
writing,
it
was
impossible
to
write
a
paper
on
a
free
topic,
except
during
the
NArt
weekO
once
a
year.
In
fact,
I
used
to
fulfill
my
creative
side
reading
novels
and
other
books.
Nevertheless,
everything
changed
in
my
last
year
of
secondary
school
in
Peru,
my
literature
professor
was
very
concerned
with
the
expression
part
of
the
group.
Then,
he
assigned
us
various
creative
assignments.
I
remember
especially
one
in
which
we
were
asked
to
write
a
poem
dedicated
to
the
Virgin
Mary.
That
poem
marked
me
because
I
always
considered
myself
to
have
very
scarce
ideas
to
write
poetry.
I
remember
I
changed
the
strategy
for
that
one
poem,
since
it
had
to
be
a
perfect
sonnet.
I
first
worked
the
theme
and
the
main
ideas.
Before
that,
I
used
to
find
the
last
words
of
each
verse,
so
that
they
would
rhyme.
However,
that
time
I
started
brainstorming
and
focusing
on
the
message.
After
I
had
the
message
outlined,
I
started
thinking
of
the
words
I
wanted
to
use,
so
I
chose
to
use
solemn
words.
However,
I
wanted
my
poem
to
be
touching
and
keep
peopleOs
attention.
In
fact,
the
winning
poem
would
be
read
at
a
very
important
event
in
my
school.
So
I
decided
to
have
a
very
rhythmic
poem
by
putting
several
adjectives,
alliterations
and
metaphors.
I
remember
it
took
very
long
for
me
to
write
it,
I
did
dispose
many
samples,
until
I
finally
liked
it.
That
was
for
me
the
first
time
I
had
written
a
poem
I
liked.
It
was
something
unusual
because
I
did
not
use
to
write
in
such
a
professional
way,
so
it
made
me
happy.
Moreover,
I
became
even
happier
and
beamed
when
my
poem
won
the
competition
and
was
read
in
front
of
all
parents
and
students.
Fortunately
that
was
not
the
last
time
I
had
the
opportunity
to
write.
Indeed
I
studied
two
years
of
high
school
in
Italy
where
I
had
the
opportunity
to
learn
three
languages
at
the
same
time:
I
refined
my
Spanish,
improved
my
English
and
learned
Italian.
In
that
school
I
had
the
opportunity
to
attend
an
activity
called
Creative
Writing.
It
burst
my
writing
to
levels
that
I
did
not
know
I
could
reach.
Soon,
I
started
to
write
short
stories
and
projects
of
novels.
For
instance,
I
was
given
the
first
sentence
of
each
story
and
then
I
had
to
write
in
the
language
I
desired.
It
was
very
helpful
to
have
this
kind
of
motivation
because
my
mind
picked
that
topics
and
I
was
totally
free
to
divagate
and
express
myself.
I
believe
I
made
those
stories
very
personal,
in
fact,
sometimes
I
felt
ashamed
when
some
friend
read
my
pieces.
It
was
my
own
creation
and
I
felt
they
reflected
too
much
about
me.
I
believe
that
activity
was
very
enriching
and
taught
me
about
my
limits
when
writing.
I
had
the
best
and
worst
writing
experiences
in
that
class.
I
remember
that
the
best
one
was
when
we
went
to
a
cliff
by
the
sea
and
we
had
to
write
a
story
about
a
conversation
about
two
inanimate
beings,
I
chose
a
conversation
between
the
sea
and
the
sun
while
it
is
setting.
I
was
delighted
with
the
result
because
I
involved
numerous
sorts
of
experiences
and
worries
I
had
at
the
time.
It
was
a
poem
written
in
prose
and
I
showed
it
to
my
teacher.
I
think
she
did
not
appreciate
it
as
much
as
I
did,
however,
I
think
she
was
satisfied
with
my
imagination.
On
the
other
hand,
my
worst
experience
writing
occurred
when
we
had
to
write
a
theatre
drama.
I
tried
to
change
the
end
of
a
book
in
my
drama;
however,
it
did
not
have
the
agility
I
wanted
and
became
tedious.
After
I
finished
I
wanted
to
tear
the
notebook
where
I
wrote
that.
While
I
was
writing
it
there
was
a
moment
I
could
not
move
forward
or
backwards,
I
was
completely
lost
in
my
creation
and
had
to
start
again.
However,
it
was
not
better,
my
second
trial
showed
me
how
reduced
my
imagination
I
was
at
the
moment
and
my
writing
became
immobile
again.
That
was
a
frustrating
experience.
In
Italy,
I
studied
the
international
baccalaureate
program
for
which
we
have
to
write
a
research
paper
called
extended
essay.
The
extended
essay
was
a
4000-word
paper.
I
wrote
my
extended
essay
on
the
situation
of
the
Truth
Commission
held
in
Peru
to
deal
with
20
years
of
terrorism.
I
focused
on
how
the
government
is
delaying
the
social
compensations
and
what
tools
they
have
used
in
the
past
years
to
avoid
it.
It
took
me
several
months
of
research
and
writing
to
write
a
final
copy.
In
fact,
I
visited
my
advisor
six
times,
when
we
were
asked
to
do
it
only
twice.
Writing
the
extended
essay
I
understood
how
different
a
research
paper
is
from
a
creative
writing
one.
Moreover,
the
writing
itself
was
not
as
long
as
the
research
experience
because
the
basic
ideas
were
simple;
however,
it
was
the
first
time
I
had
document
an
essay.
That
essay
taught
me
the
importance
of
references
and
quotations,
so
it
prepared
me
very
well
for
my
future
experience
at
Lafayette.
Therefore,
when
I
first
came
to
Lafayette
I
felt
comfortable
and
confident
of
my
writing
skills.
Fortunately
for
myself,
I
had
experienced
different
types
of
writing
and
even
if
I
did
not
have
an
expertise
in
all
of
them,
I,
at
least,
had
a
taste
of
each.
Therefore,
I
felt
I
was
prepared
to
come
to
Lafayette
and
have
a
good
performance
as
a
writer.
As
a
consequence,
I
did
not
have
trouble
writing
papers
for
my
First
Year
Seminar.
I
believe
my
professor
would
agree
with
me
because
he
told
me
I
was
one
of
the
best
writers
in
the
class,
even
if
my
English
grammar
is
not
perfect
yet.
So
far
I
have
not
been
challenged
as
much
as
I
wanted.
However,
I
am
very
confident
that
in
some
politics
classes
I
plan
to
take
I
will
have
to
use
my
skills
and
keep
improving.
Nowadays
most
of
my
writing
is
devoted
to
Engineers
without
Borders.
We
have
to
write
manuals
that
people
in
Honduras
have
to
read
and
understand.
Therefore,
it
is
a
challenge
for
me
to
write
instructions
and
suggestions
in
English
about
topics
I
am
just
learning,
related
to
engineering,
and
then,
translate
them
into
Spanish.
Also,
I
do
not
know
a
great
amount
of
words
in
Spanish
because
they
are
technical;
however,
this
is
my
new
challenge
and
I
am
happy
to
experience
technical
writing
because
I
will
be
an
engineer
and
I
will
use
this
at
work.
To
recapitulate,
I
think
my
writing
has
enormously
changed
since
I
first
wrote
that
poem.
Now
I
write
at
least
in
two
different
languages
and
feel
that
I
have
my
own
style.
Moreover,
I
have
been
told
varied
opinions
about
my
writing.
Some
of
my
teachers
thought
I
had
a
style
very
close
to
Garcia
Marquez
in
my
short
stories,
my
FYS
professor
uttered
that
write
with
passion
and
I
am
very
direct
and
my
friends
say
I
usually
write
everything
as
poetry;
however,
I
always
write
in
prose.
As
a
conclusion,
I
believe
that
writing
is
a
fundamental
part
of
me,
in
fact,
I
would
think
totally
differently
if
I
had
not
read,
in
the
first
time,
and
then
write.
I
am
very
glad
I
wanted
to
imitate
my
fatherOs
signature
when
I
was
still
a
very
little
child.
