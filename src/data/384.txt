Literary
Narrative
At
the
age
of
three
my
parents
discovered
that
I
could
read.
They
canOt
say
exactly
how
I
learned
to
do
it
so
everyone
assumes
I
taught
myself.
My
guess
is
Sesame
Street.
Consequently,
they
sent
me
to
a
kindergarten
where
I
learned
how
to
write.
My
earliest
piece
of
writing
dealt
with
heartbreak.
It
was
a
song,
a
Calypso,
about
a
man
who
was
crying
for
his
wife
who
had
left
him.
My
mother
still
has
the
now
yellow
piece
of
paper
with
the
faded
pencil
scribbling.
I
was
four.
She
whips
it
out
every
now
and
again
and
shows
it
to
friends,
embarrassing
me
to
no
end.
I
guess
I
was
a
bit
precocious
at
that
age.
These
days
most
of
the
writing
that
I
do
does
not
come
as
spontaneously
as
that
song
did.
In
fact,
the
writing
process
has
become,
unfortunately,
somewhat
stressful.
There
are
deadlines,
page
limits
and
not
much
choice
in
what
or
how
I
write.
I
still
write
sometimes
for
pleasure,
even
therapeutically
in
journals
and
sometimes,
when
IOm
lucky,
a
poem
falls
out
onto
the
page.
I
began
writing
poetry
in
primary
school.
IOm
not
one
of
those
people
who
write
poems
that
are
so
intensely
personal
that
I
canOt
show
a
living
soul.
No,
IOm
quite
the
opposite,
as
soon
as
the
final
word
is
written
I
have
to
show
it
to
someone,
usually
friends
or
family.
One
of
my
favorite
early
memories
of
another
personOs
reaction
to
what
I
had
written
happened
when
I
met
one
of
my
fatherOs
friends.
My
father
wasnOt
around
at
the
time
and
the
man
said,
NSo
youOre
the
one
who
writes
poetry?O
I
was
so
proud
that
my
father
had
boasted
about
my
poems.
In
my
mind
that
could
only
mean
that
he
liked
them
and
that
made
me
so
excited.
I
was
somewhat
shy
at
the
time
though
so
I
just
blushed
and
I
suppose
I
shook
my
head
because
the
man
said,
NOh,
well
I
guess
it
was
the
older
daughter
then.O
Most
of
the
writing
that
I
did
in
primary
school
was
one-page
compositions
with
titles
like
NMy
day
at
the
BeachO
or
NHonesty
is
the
best
policy.O
At
my
school
we
had
to
write
with
pens
or
in
only
rare
cases
of
emergency,
pencils.
While
pens
were
preferred
we
were
never
to
use
ballpoint
pens,
only
those
horrible
fountain
pens,
which
I
hated.
They
always
leaked
and
the
ink
got
all
over
my
fingers
and
sometimes
too
much
would
come
out
when
I
was
writing
and
leave
an
ugly
drop
on
the
page,
which
you
were
supposed
to
blot
with
special
blotting
paper.
I
usually
used
the
skirt
of
my
uniform.
Typically,
I
would
OaccidentallyO
leave
my
pen
at
home
and
use
a
pencil,
which
I
preferred
because
I
could
erase
my
mistakes.
Incidentally,
liquid
paper
was
never
allowed
either.
You
had
to
draw
a
line
through
your
mistakes
leaving
your
composition
looking
scarred
and
untidy.
This
made
writing
with
a
pen
even
more
undesirable
since
points
were
taken
off
for
messy
work.
In
Standard
V,
my
last
year
of
primary
school,
composition
writing
took
on
a
much
greater
importance
since
it
was
a
very
big
part
of
the
Common
Entrance
Examinations.
Common
Entrance
is
an
exam
that
all
primary
school
students
take
before
entering
secondary
school.
Your
performance
in
that
exam
determined
which
school
you
attended.
Needless
to
say
it
was
a
very
stressful
time
for
a
ten
year-old,
especially
since
in
those
days
you
were
not
guaranteed
a
spot
in
any
secondary
school.
Not
finding
a
place
was
never
really
my
worry
because
I
was
a
good
student
and
my
teachers
always
told
me
that
I
wrote
well.
However,
going
to
a
school
other
than
the
one
I
wanted
to
go
to
did
worry
me.
On
your
mark
E
get
set
E
write!
You
must
remember
grammar
and
spelling!
Oh,
and
show
a
wide
range
of
vocabulary!
DonOt
put
too
many
words
in
a
paragraph!
DonOt
forget
the
exciting
introduction
to
your
composition
to
interest
the
readers!
And
you
must
not
forget
the
interesting
conclusion!
How
I
hated
writing
in
Standard
V.
You
had
to
choose
one
out
of
about
three
of
four
topics,
form
your
ideas
and
write
the
allotted
number
of
words
all
in
some
set
time.
It
sucked
all
the
enjoyment
out
of
something
that
I
once
considered
fun.
It
had
now
just
become
work.
In
secondary
school
I
learned
to
dislike
school
writing
even
more.
Now
came
even
more
rules.
I
suppose
that
learning
about
alliteration,
onomatopoeia
and
various
other
technical
points
is
important
but
to
me
it
just
seemed
like
more
things
I
had
to
remember
to
incorporate
in
my
writing
in
order
to
do
well.
In
my
personal
writing
however,
I
wrote
as
I
pleased.
Maybe
without
even
knowing
it
I
did
become
more
aware
of
mood
and
themes
and
everything
else
that
youOre
supposed
to
think
about
while
writing,
but
for
the
most
part
whatever
sounded
good
to
me
was
what
I
wrote.
This
was
also
the
time
when
I
learned
to
write
about
topics
that
were
not
always
interesting
to
me.
While
writing
I
remember
stopping
frequently
to
count
how
many
words
I
had
as
I
plodded
along
towards
what
felt
like
the
elusive
word
limit.
Being
told
what
I
had
to
write
about
sometimes
felt
restrictive
but
sometimes
it
allowed
me
learn
and
think
about
something
that
I
may
not
have,
had
it
not
been
required
of
me.
I
remember
having
to
write
a
report
on
a
historical
figure
from
the
Second
World
War.
I
chose
Hitler
and
learned
much
more
about
him
than
I
would
have
from
just
sitting
in
class.
Although
I
did
not
particularly
like
having
to
write
for
classes,
for
the
most
part
I
was
good
at
it.
Teachers
regularly
commented
that
I
wrote
very
clearly
and
intelligently,
something
which
I
would
hear
again
at
college.
When
I
was
about
thirteen
years
old
my
motherOs
friend
visited
my
family
for
a
few
days.
She
brought
her
laptop
with
her.
I
had
never
seen
one
before
and
I
loved
how
the
keys
sounded
when
you
typed.
Sometimes
I
would
tap
on
it
when
it
was
off
just
to
hear
the
noise
and
pretend
I
was
one
of
those
writers
in
the
movies.
I
knew
that
I
had
to
write
something
on
this
machine.
I
felt
the
same
way
about
typewriters
whose
sound
I
loved
even
more.
I
especially
loved
the
Oching!O
sound
it
made
when
you
started
a
new
line.
However,
this
laptop
had
something
that
no
typewriter
did:
a
backspace
key!
I
loved
being
able
to
go
back
and
erase
mistakes.
I
could
take
out
entire
paragraphs
if
I
wanted
to,
without
anyone
ever
knowing.
I
decided
I
would
write
a
book.
After
devouring
countless,
NSweet
Valley
High,O
NBaby
SitterOs
ClubO
and
NSweet
DreamsO
books,
I
figured
that
I
could
write
a
book
like
that
too.
My
bookOs
title
was
NDear
Diary.O
It
seemed
fitting
enough,
I
wrote
in
my
journal
all
the
time
and
I
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
write
a
book
which
told
a
story
in
the
form
of
journal
entries.
So
I
set
out
to
write
this
book,
showing
my
friends
the
chapters
as
I
finished
them.
They
loved
them
and
would
always
ask
me
if
I
had
finished
another
chapter
yet.
It
gave
me
such
a
thrill
to
see
my
words
typed
out.
When
it
was
time
for
my
motherOs
friend
to
leave,
I
would
hand
write
the
chapters
and
then
find
a
computer
on
which
to
type.
Eventually,
I
wrote
less
and
less
until
I
finally
stopped
altogether.
I
must
have
finished
at
least
thirteen
chapters
though.
My
friends
and
I
get
a
good
laugh
when
we
remember
my
attempt
at
being
a
novelist.
My
mother
of
course
thought
it
was
the
cutest
thing
and
to
this
day
chides
me
for
not
having
saved
it.
NYou
could
have
shown
your
children!O
Throughout
my
life
so
far
I
had
heard
enough
times
that
I
wrote
well
to
believe
it.
In
fact,
the
only
time
I
can
remember
really
doubting
myself
was
when
I
was
sixteen
years
old
and
I
was
chosen
as
Valedictorian
of
my
graduating
class.
The
Valedictorian
is
more
like
LafayetteOs
Pepper
Prize
winner
than
the
Valedictorian
in
US
high
schools,
who
is
the
person
with
the
best
grades.
At
my
high
school
the
person
chosen
by
the
rest
of
the
graduating
class
is
someone
who
most
closely
represents
the
ideal
St.
Augustine
GirlsO
High
School
student.
I
won
but
some
members
of
the
staff
preferred
another
girl
and
the
Principal
insisted
that
the
class
should
vote
again.
That
was
a
very
painful
moment.
I
agreed
anyway
and
won
again.
Afterward,
one
of
the
English
teachers,
who
was
supposed
to
help
the
Valedictorian
write
her
speech
suggested
that
I
let
the
other
girl
write
it
and
I
read
it.
NYou
know,O
she
said,
Nlike
you
read
your
lines
in
those
plays.
Because
Michelle
is
the
writer
and
youOre
the
actress.O
I
felt
as
though
I
had
been
slapped.
This
teacher
had
never
taught
me,
so
didnOt
have
any
idea
whether
or
not
I
could
write
and
knew
only
that
Michelle
had
a
poem
of
hers
published
in
the
local
newspaper
while
I
performed
in
drama
festivals.
I
expected
teachers
who
had
actually
taught
me
to
lend
support.
They
did
not.
In
fact
I
was
instructed
to
write
a
draft,
which
Michelle
was
to
help
me
with,
which
would
then
be
scrutinized
by
a
number
of
staff
members.
It
was
humiliating.
No
other
Valedictorian
had
ever
before
received
such
treatment.
After
diplomatically
listening
to
their
suggestions
I
just
as
quickly
brushed
them
aside
and
went
about
the
business
of
writing
the
speech
on
my
own.
Every
day
leading
up
to
graduation
there
were
several
meetings
held
to
check
on
my
progress.
A
lot
of
tears
were
shed
but
my
class
was
behind
me.
In
fact
a
group
of
my
classmates
went
to
the
Principal
herself
to
complain
about
how
I
was
being
treated.
I
greatly
appreciated
the
show
of
support
but
that
didnOt
completely
stop
the
damage
that
had
been
done
to
my
confidence.
I
experienced
a
great
deal
of
anxiety
and
questioned
my
ability
to
write.
Finally,
determined
to
prove
myself,
I
wrote
my
speech
and
delivered
it
at
the
graduation
ceremony.
I
got
a
standing
ovation
from
my
class.
Some
parents
even
came
up
to
me
afterward
to
tell
me
how
moving
it
was.
Ever
the
diplomat,
I
graciously
accepted
the
congratulations
of
the
staff.
Entering
college
was
an
extremely
difficult
time
for
me.
I
was
homesick,
lonely
and
as
an
island
girl,
terribly
cold
and
culture-shocked
in
Easton,
PA.
Writing
in
my
journal
became
an
almost
daily
ritual.
Even
the
materials
I
used
were
to
help
cheer
me
up.
I
wrote
with
the
pen
my
best
friend
gave
me,
with
our
name
engraved,
in
the
journal
that
another
of
my
closest
friends
gave
me.
Academically,
the
writing
process
had
not
become
any
less
stressful.
Never
before
had
I
had
to
write
as
much.
Five
pages?
Ten?
I
thought
it
was
impossible.
I
found
myself
procrastinating
before
beginning
papers,
afraid
of
what
seemed
like
such
a
huge
task.
I
doubted
if
had
enough
to
say
to
fill
all
these
pages.
I
remember
before
starting
to
write
any
paper
I
would
draw
diagrams
of
little
pages
and
draw
lines
on
these
drawings
to
mark
off
where
each
point
would
end.
For
instance
half
of
the
first
diagram
would
have
the
word
Ointroduction.O
Next
the
bottom
half
of
the
first
diagram
and
the
top
half
of
the
second
would
have
the
words
Nfirst
point
and
examples.O
All
this
was
to
break
the
task
down
into
smaller
more
manageable,
and
much
less
intimidating,
pieces.
My
professors
usually
comment
that
IOm
a
very
concise,
clear
writer.
My
English
Professor
even
guessed
that
I
was
an
engineering
student
by
the
way
I
wrote.
She
said
that
my
papers
looked
like
this:
strong
theses,
supporting
point,
examples,
supporting
point,
examples,
and
strong
conclusions
restating
the
theses.
Clear,
concise,
easy
to
follow.
I
attribute
the
style
of
my
papers
to
my
inclination
to
follow
rules
while
writing
academically.
Somewhere
in
my
education
I
must
have
been
told
that
that
was
how
a
paper
should
be
laid
out.
I
follow
instructions
and
guidelines
almost
like
recipes
sometimes.
In
fact,
I
love
it
when
professors
give
guidelines.
Even
with
this
narrative
I
read
and
re-read
the
guidelines
before
even
attempting
to
write
one
sentence.
I
suppose
it
makes
me
feel
more
confident
that
IOm
writing
the
OrightO
way.
In
academic
writing
I
find
that
there
is
a
lot
of
emphasis
placed
on
doing
things
in
a
specific,
correct
way.
You
should
use
between
a
ten
and
twelve
point
font,
lines
should
be
double
spaced,
title
at
the
center
of
the
page,
page
numbers
in
the
top
right
hand
corner,
etc.
It
all
seems
somewhat
restrictive
and
I
sometimes
fear
that
individual
style
is
suppressed.
For
instance,
writers
often
speak
of
finding
their
Ovoice.O
What
is
my
voice?
Can
I
find
it
if
IOm
told
how
to
write?
More
importantly
will
I
find
it
when
I
feel
so
comfortable
and
secure
being
told
how
to
write?
I
suppose
that
is
why
for
me,
writing
outside
the
classroom
is
so
much
more
rewarding.
There
is
no
anxiety,
no
self-doubt
and
no
wondering
whether
IOm
doing
it
right.
There
are
no
grammar
or
punctuation
rules,
only
guidelines
and
these
need
only
be
followed
loosely.
There
is
no
censoring
myself
and
I
donOt
have
to
put
my
dialect
in
quotation
marks
because
in
private
the
QueenOs
English
is
not
superior
to
my
own
Trinidadian
speech
and
vernacular.
There
is
nothing
but
me,
an
idea
and
words.
Wonderful
words
to
be
used
as
I
see
fit.
