My
Literary
Narrative
When
I
think
about
the
writing
I
did
when
I
first
started
school,
I
recall
that
much
more
attention
was
paid
to
HOW
I
wrote
than
to
WHAT
I
wrote.
My
handwriting
was
not
too
great.
Actually,
it
was
terrible.
To
this
day
I
am
still
told
that
I
write
like
a
guy,
whatever
that
means.
The
earliest
memory
I
have
of
someone
actually
noticing
WHAT
I
wrote
was
in
fifth
grade.
A
week
of
our
English
class
was
dedicated
to
creative
writing.
I
wrote
a
poem
with
the
line
darkness...
touches
you
softly.
My
teacher
loved
it
and
wrote
it
on
the
board
for
the
class
to
admire.
So
despite
the
initial
negative
feedback
about
my
handwriting,
when
I
got
to
the
stage
when
I
actually
had
to
create
something
of
my
own,
I
was
encouraged.
Throughout
middle
school
and
high
school
I
continued
to
be
interested
in
creative
writing,
and
to
try
my
hand
at
both
poetry
and
short
stories.
A
major
motivation
for
my
writing
in
high
school
was
a
club
I
joined
called
the
Irving
Society
(named
for
Washington
Irving).
It
had
been
organized
by
a
young
English
teacher
we
all
adored.
We
met
on
Friday
nights
in
his
apartment
and
each
read
an
original
work
by
candlelight.
Afterwards,
we
had
snacks
and
hung
out
for
the
rest
of
the
night.
For
me
it
was
as
much
about
being
social
as
about
writing
(Irving
Society
meetings
were
where
I
met
most
of
my
friends
when
I
started
boarding
school),
but
it
was
important
to
my
growth
as
a
creative
writer
because
it
kept
me
writing
throughout
high
school.
I
also
won
a
creative
writing
award
my
sophomore
year,
which
inspired
me
to
keep
at
it.
Another
landmark
event
in
my
high
school
creative
writing
was
the
five
weeks
I
spent
at
Pennsylvania
Governor's
School
for
the
Arts
in
Erie
between
my
junior
and
senior
years.
I
had
an
excellent
teacher
who
took
the
summer
program
in
short
story
writing
very
seriously.
I
was
lucky
to
be
there
since
the
program
is
very
competitive
(it's
free)
and
I
had
been
pulled
off
the
waiting
list
when
someone
else
declined.
I
can
honestly
say
I
think
I
got
more
out
of
our
writing
classes
than
anyone
else.
Because
I
went
to
boarding
school,
being
away
from
home
wasn't
such
a
big
deal
for
me,
I
was
much
more
interested
in
writing.
Whereas
most
other
people
would
stay
up
all
night
and
show
up
for
class
at
8
in
the
morning
barely
able
to
function,
I
was
always
well
rested
and
ready
to
workshop.
Workshopping
was
probably
the
most
important
new
tool
I
added
to
my
writing
toolbox
that
summer:
I
became
more
proficient
at
talking
about
writing,
and
at
giving
and
accepting
both
positive
and
negative
feedback.
Ironically,
this
time
I
was
more
interested
in
writing
than
in
socializing,
and
I
learned
a
great
deal.
I've
been
chronicling
my
growth
as
a
creative
writer,
but
I
was
simultaneously
learning
how
to
be
a
better
expository
writer.
It
was
around
8th
grade
that
I
first
became
aware
of
the
distinction
between
these
two
forms
of
writing
(although
I
eventually
realized
that
they
were
not
as
separate
as
I
was
initially
taught).
I
remember
doing
well
on
writing
assignments
in
middle
school
and
the
beginning
of
high
school,
but
nothing
particular
stands
out
in
my
mind.
It
was
not
until
my
junior
year,
when
I
took
a
notorious
course
referred
to
merely
as
seminar,
that
I
came
to
see
writing
as
a
process
and
as
a
struggle.
The
course
combined
A.P
History
and
A.P.
English,
was
taught
by
the
two
oldest
curmudgeons
at
my
school,
and
required
a
4
page
paper
a
week,
which
seemed
like
a
novel
at
that
time.
All
of
us
in
the
course
developed
a
special
bond
based
on
our
shared
struggle
to
complete
these
monstrous
assignments.
We
were
constantly
asking
each
other
who
had
started
the
paper
and
what
topics
had
been
chosen.
We
all
developed
a
different
process
to
complete
our
papers
--
my
process
was
to
think
about
the
paper
all
week
and
write
down
ideas,
and
then
to
sit
down
at
my
parents'
computer
on
Sunday
afternoon
to
complete
it.
I
laugh
now
to
think
that
it
took
me
at
least
3
hours
to
finish
a
four
page
paper.
I
still
use
the
same
process
that
I
developed
then
--
I
spend
most
of
my
time
getting
ideas,
then
sit
down
and
write
the
paper
all
at
once,
although
I
can
now
write
much
more
quickly.
I
also
continue
to
compose
while
at
the
keyboard.
One
of
my
teachers
for
the
course
used
to
grade
us
by
making
a
list
of
notes
on
the
last
page
of
the
paper,
a
technique
I
now
use
as
a
W.A.
Another
teacher
in
high
school
had
an
impact
on
my
writing
because
he
taught
us
that,
contrary
to
my
earlier
belief,
the
conclusion
did
not
necessarily
have
to
summarize
the
paper.
I
had
him
for
several
classes,
and
developed
a
special
fondness
for
conclusions
as
a
result.
Thus,
by
the
time
I
finished
high
school,
I
had
been
influenced
by
several
proficient
teachers
and
had
been
lucky
enough
to
have
writing
experiences
that
not
everyone
was
able
to
enjoy
(e.g.
Governor's
School,
Irving
Society,
A.P.
English).
When
I
got
to
college,
I
was
pretty
familiar
with
writing
in
general
and
with
my
own
writing
process,
i.e.
what
I
personally
had
to
do
in
order
to
produce
a
polished
paper.
But
I
was
hardly
at
the
end
of
my
evolution
as
a
writer
(and
probably
never
will
be
at
the
end).
The
first
major
shock
I
had
at
Lafayette
was
that
my
First
Year
Seminar
Professor
expected
us
to
complete
three
drafts
of
every
paper.
I
considered
this
many
drafts
to
be
exorbitant
and
at
first
I
hated
having
to
complete
them.
Since
I
had
the
Professor
for
another
class
with
the
same
writing
policy,
I
felt
like
I
was
always
turning
in
drafts,
although
I
really
liked
my
W.A.
and
appreciated
her
input.
I
think
I
personally
need
two,
not
three,
drafts
to
produce
a
good
paper,
but
I
did
learn
to
appreciate
the
importance
of
revising.
I
had
a
huge
initial
dose
of
the
revising
process,
and
I
now
see
it
as
an
essential
element
of
my
writing
process.
The
next
shift
in
my
ideas
about
writing
came
when
I
took
Psychology
courses
where
I
had
to
write
extensive
lab
reports.
This
was
my
first
experience
with
the
world
of
scientific
writing.
Although
I
found
scientific
writing
to
be
dry
and
quite
dull,
I
also
found
that
I
was
very
good
at
it.
I
don't
know
if
this
skill
is
beneficial
to
me
or
not.
It
has
helped
me
do
well
in
the
psych
courses
I
have
taken,
but
I
fear
that
it
has
also
affected
my
general
writing
style,
making
it
more
dry
and
matter-of-fact,
with
no
flair.
I
realized
after
learning
to
write
in
the
APA
style
that
the
expository
writing
I
was
doing
was
much
more
creative
than
I
believed
when
I
was
writing
it.
I
continue
to
try
to
improve
my
scientific
writing
without
losing
the
flair
and
personality
from
my
general
writing
style.
The
last
major
event
in
my
writing
evolution
has
been
my
job
as
a
W.A.
I
began
to
learn
how
to
discuss
writing
at
Governor's
School,
and
with
English
teachers
in
high
school,
but
my
W.A.
job
forced
me
to
really
hone
my
communicative
skill,
and
to
talk
about
other
people's
writing,
not
my
own.
I
found
discussing
other
people's
writing
more
difficult
than
I
at
first
assumed
it
would
be.
Revising
a
draft
of
your
own
paper
is
one
thing,
but
helping
someone
else
revise
theirs
is
another.
You
want
to
help
them,
but
on
the
other
hand
you
don't
want
to
write
it
for
them.
I
could
pick
up
a
paper
and
easily
revise
it
myself,
but
when
discussing
a
paper
with
someone
else
I
have
found
it
challenging
to
expand
on
the
initial
comment
you
need
to
work
on
this....
Since
I
have
been
a
W.A.
for
both
an
English
writing
course
and
a
Psychology
course,
the
job
has
also
helped
me
crystallize
my
knowledge
of
the
two
very
different
styles,
and
to
be
more
aware
of
the
differences
in
my
own
writing
in
each
area.
Many
of
the
people
I
worked
with
in
the
Psychology
course
had
a
difficult
time
expressing
themselves
precisely
and
clearly,
which
made
me
more
aware
of
my
own
precision
and
clarity
in
scientific
writing,
and
perhaps
over-dryness
when
writing
in
other
areas.
I
started
trying
to
make
letters
with
a
thick
pencil,
and
was
not
very
successful.
But
when
I
was
able
to
shift
focus
to
the
writing
itself,
I
enjoyed
what
I
was
doing
and
was
praised,
encouraged,
and
(constructively)
criticized
by
many
influential
people.
It
seems
that
as
my
writing
has
developed,
it
has
actually
branched
in
several
different
directions,
first
into
creative
and
expository
writing,
and
then
into
scientific
writing.
On
the
one
hand,
being
able
to
write
for
different
effects
and
different
audiences
is
an
important
skill
for
a
mature
writer.
On
the
other
hand,
sometimes
I
wish
that
my
writing
were
not
so
stratified,
that
I
didn't
feel
the
need
to
be
either
creative
or
scientific.
If
I
were
to
set
a
goal
for
my
continuing
development
as
a
writer,
it
would
be
to
better
integrate
my
various
writing
modes.
I
want
to
feel
like
a
writer
who
has
flair
and
flexibility,
not
like
a
writer
with
a
multiple
personality
disorder.
