A
History
of
Writing
I
may
not
be
able
to
recount
the
exact
day
that
I
wrote
my
first
word
nor
the
circumstances
under
which
I
wrote
it,
but
I
can
certainly
remember
what
the
word
was.
It
is
possibly
the
most
frequently
written
word
in
my
vocabulary
(except
for
maybe
a,
I,
and
the)
D
my
name.
It
also
probably
the
most
important
word
in
my
vocabulary,
if
you
can
put
words
into
an
order
of
importance.
Without
those
five
letters,
identifying
myself
would
be
impossible.
My
earliest
memory
of
writing
my
name
was
approximately
16
years
ago.
I
specifically
recall
sitting
on
the
end
of
my
blue
leather
couch
and
practicing
the
letters
over
and
over
again.
I
would
trace
the
outline
J
E
N
N
A
that
my
mother
wrote
out
for
me
on
an
old-fashioned
dry
erase
pad
she
had
purchased.
I
alternated
between
tracing
the
letters
she
had
written
and
attempting
to
reproduce
them
on
a
separate
line.
The
letters
themselves
fascinated
me.
I
can
clearly
picture
how
enthralled
I
was
by
the
letter
J
because
the
curly
part
had
to
face
a
certain
way
and
how
lucky
I
was
for
having
two
NOs
in
my
name
because
it
was
like
I
only
had
to
know
four
letters.
As
I
grew
older
my
name
turned
into
just
the
word
I
put
at
the
top
of
all
my
papers.
It
became
less
exciting
and
more
automatic.
There
was
no
looking
back;
I
had
many
more
words
to
write
and
a
thing
or
two
to
learn
about
writing.
Kindergarten
was
the
first
time
I
can
really
remember
copying
sentences.
The
most
advanced
probably
being,
The
cat
is
big.
It
was
not
until
first
grade
that
I
really
got
my
creative
juices
flowing
and
made
up
some
of
my
own
sentences.
Second
grade
was
a
big
year.
I
put
about
5-8
original
sentences
in
a
row
and
created
a
paragraph!
All
of
the
sentences
in
a
paragraph
had
something
to
do
with
one
another;
if
it
was
random
it
did
not
make
sense.
This
concept
came
fairly
easy
to
me
because
I
loved
to
read.
All
of
the
books
I
read
contained
paragraphs,
which
contained
sentences,
which
related
to
each
other
and
that
just
made
sense.
My
favorite
paragraphs
were
the
ones
written
in
the
form
of
a
letter
and
mailed
to
an
assigned
pen
pal.
Second
grade
was
also
the
year
that
I
learned
how
to
write
in
cursive.
Practicing
penmanship
was
never
the
most
readable
task,
but
somewhat
like
a
game.
It
was
almost
a
contest
between
myself
and
the
paper
to
see
if
I
had
to
pick
up
my
pencil
in
the
middle
of
a
word
or
not.
Third
grade
was
just
a
refining
of
what
I
learned
in
second
grade
including
more
paragraph
practice.
Then
came
the
fourth
grade.
As
far
as
I
was
concerned
this
meant
the
privilege
of
erasable
pens
and
as
I
would
come
to
find
out,
book
reports.
Book
reports
were
assigned
once
a
month
and
I
always
thought
it
was
silly
to
write
about
a
book
that
was
already
written.
What
could
I
write
that
was
not
already
written
by
the
author?
I
now
realize
that
it
was
the
precursor
to
researching
and
referencing.
I
jumped
these
hurdles
for
the
first
time
in
eighth
grade.
We
were
researching
the
holocaust
and
I
wrote
a
paper
about
Anne
Frank.
I
never
realized
how
much
I
could
write
on
a
single
topic
before
(about
eight
pages)
and
was
highly
impressed
with
myself.
It
is
forever
engrained
in
me
on
how
to
start
a
paper
like
the
one
I
wrote
in
eighth
grade.
It
began
with,
NBrainstorm,
brainstorm,
brainstorm.O
I
really
never
thought
I
would
hear
the
end
of
that.
My
teacher
tried
to
make
it
interesting
by
showing
us
that
we
could
make
a
flow
chart,
bubbles,
boxes,
a
spider
web,
anything
that
would
set
up
the
organization
of
our
papers.
Next
came
rough
drafts,
a
key
to
any
kind
of
developed
paper.
Eighth
grade
was
also
the
year
I
got
my
first
taste
of
what
would
become
very
popular
in
college
D
lab
reports.
This
was
the
first
time
I
can
remember
having
any
strict
guidelines
for
my
writing.
There
were
limitations
and
requirements
from
the
font
to
bold
headings.
I
can
remember
a
proud
moment
at
Lehigh
University
when
I
presented
my
lab
report
and
received
third
place.
I
always
felt
accomplished
when
I
was
praised
for
my
writing,
but
I
had
never
received
any
recognition
for
a
lab
report
before
that
moment.
The
experience
encouraged
me
to
consider
a
future
in
science.
In
high
school
I
quickly
discovered
that
it
took
more
than
brain
storming
and
rough
drafts
to
write
a
paper.
Apparently
there
were
guidelines
that
needed
to
be
adhered
to
in
order
to
make
the
paper
accurate.
The
MLA
format
was
used
throughout
high
school;
we
were
even
required
to
purchase
a
book
about
it.
One
of
my
teachers
sophomore
year
was
especially
notorious
for
over-emphasizing
the
details
of
the
outline.
This
did
not
bother
me.
I
actually
prefer
when
a
teacher
gives
you
a
list
of
what
he
or
she
expects
and
part
of
your
grade
becomes
how
well
you
followed
directions.
This
same
teacher
selected
me
to
be
on
the
yearbook
committee
for
my
junior
and
senior
years.
Yearbook
content
was
much
more
theme
focused
than
anything
else
I
had
ever
written.
For
example
one
year
it
was
a
comic
book
theme.
I
was
really
able
to
write
what
I
wanted
and
even
rouse
a
laugh
or
two
when
writing
captions
that
doubled
as
comic
strips.
I
feel
successful
when
my
writing
evokes
emotion,
especially
laughter.
Another
discovery
I
made
in
high
school
was
that
there
was
not
always
enough
time
to
brainstorm
and
perfect
multiple
drafts.
Every
English
test
I
took
had
at
least
one
essay
attached
to
the
back.
I
remember
trying
to
allot
enough
time
for
the
essay
when
I
was
answering
the
multiple-choice
questions.
I
can
still
picture
myself
at
my
desk
looking
at
the
clock
with
my
hand
moving
as
quickly
as
it
could
to
write
every
detail
I
knew
to
answer
the
essay
question.
I
had
to
overcome
many
a
hand
cramp,
writerOs
block,
and
invent
a
thesis
sentence
all
in
a
matter
of
twenty
minutes.
It
is
safe
to
say
that
I
could
build
up
a
sweat
during
an
English
test;
my
heart
rate
is
higher
now
just
thinking
about
it.
At
the
time
I
convinced
myself
that
my
teacher
took
pleasure
in
watching
us
write
as
fast
as
we
could
and
privately
laughed
at
the
answers
we
came
up
with.
I
now
want
to
thank
him
for
unknowingly
giving
me
excellent
SAT
preparation.
Before
high
school
the
only
people
I
would
let
read
my
writing
were
my
parents,
teachers,
and
an
intended
audience
member.
When
I
got
to
high
school
I
became
familiar
with
a
process
called
peer
editing.
In
other
words,
watch
what
you
write
because
other
people
will
read
it
and
probably
make
fun
of
you
if
it
is
really
bad.
When
we
first
started
peer
editing
I
thought
it
would
be
best
to
pair
up
with
a
good
friend
not
only
would
I
be
comfortable
sharing
my
writing,
but
it
would
be
embarrassment
free,
and
bonus
-
I
would
get
to
talk
during
class.
That
is
not
always
the
best
idea.
Some
friends
are
just
not
meant
to
be
peer
editors.
I
remember
switching
papers
with
a
friend
and
sending
back
their
paper
edited
and
marked
up
with
grammar
errors
and
getting
my
paper
back
without
a
single
pen
mark.
Mind
you
this
was
not
because
my
paper
was
error
free,
when
I
went
through
it
I
found
plenty,
it
just
happened
that
my
friend
thought
the
paper
was
NGoodO
and
did
not
find
any
errors.
One
of
my
favorite
comments
I
received
from
a
teacher
was
that
if
I
edited
somebody
in
the
classOs
rough
draft
that
he
would
not
need
to
look
at
it.
All
throughout
high
school
the
teachers
emphasized
that
they
were
preparing
us
for
college.
Apparently
our
essays,
lab
reports,
papers,
and
vocabulary
exercises
were
supposed
to
prepare
us
for
college
writing.
Originally
I
associated
college
writing
with
quantity
not
so
much
quality.
I
thought
that
if
I
could
write
as
much
as
I
possibly
could
I
would
be
writing
like
a
college
student.
I
had
heard
horror
stories
from
people
who
had
graduated
ahead
of
me
saying
that
their
professors
gave
them
a
list
of
papers
and
that
they
were
required
to
hand
in
before
the
end
of
a
semester.
If
they
waited
until
the
last
minute
and
procrastinated
all
semester,
they
would
fail
the
class.
I
also
heard
tales
of
papers
being
over
20
pages
long
for
freshman
and
something
called
a
thesis
being
over
100.
Even
after
exceptional
experience
in
writing
opinion-based
papers,
arguing
a
position
in
papers,
timed
essays,
and
research
papers,
I
was
not
confident
that
I
was
prepared
for
college
writing.
My
first
taste
of
college
writing
was
probably
writing
my
essay
for
college.
I
remember
convincing
myself
that
if
I
was
sending
it
to
colleges,
it
must
be
a
college
level
paper.
I
am
not
sure
that
I
have
ever
written
more
rough
drafts
than
for
my
college
essay.
I
was
never
satisfied
with
it
and
was
reluctant
to
let
a
paper
determine
my
fate.
I
wanted
it
to
be
completely
perfect
by
the
time
I
was
finished,
after
all
I
had
quite
a
long
time
to
write
it.
I
stressed
so
much
about
the
application
process
that
I
had
two
completely
different
introductions
for
my
paper
and
was
trying
to
decide
which
one
to
choose.
Later
my
Father
would
meet
someone
from
the
admissions
office
who
recognized
me
by
my
essay.
Apparently
I
chose
the
right
introduction
because
the
person
from
the
office
explained
that
my
essay
played
a
large
role
in
my
being
accepted
to
Lafayette
College.
However,
I
am
my
own
biggest
critic,
and
I
must
say
I
am
sure
I
could
find
some
mistakes
if
I
looked
back
at
it
now.
My
second
biggest
(and
best)
critic
is
my
mother.
She
is
not
only
encouraging
but
one
of
the
few
people
who
truly
knows
what
I
am
capable
of.
Therefore
if
she
reads
something
that
is
not
my
best
work,
she
will
be
honest
with
me.
Other
comments
over
the
years
have
been
generally
positive.
I
cannot
remember
anyone
seriously
rejecting
something
I
had
written.
It
would
make
for
a
good
story,
but
luckily
I
have
not
been
traumatized
by
any
means.
Comments
I
have
received
that
are
in
my
opinion
the
most
effective
are
given
via
the
facilitative
approach.
Like
the
paper,
Responding
to
Problems:
The
Facilitative
Approach,
I
find
that
I
learn
best
when
someone
guides
me
in
the
right
direction,
but
I
have
to
answer
the
question
myself.
This
way
I
remember
what
I
learn
because
I
came
up
with
the
answer
instead
of
forgetting
the
answer
because
someone
just
gave
it
to
me.
Sometimes
I
tend
to
go
off
on
a
tangent
with
my
writing.
With
someone
guiding
me
with
a
facilitative
approach,
asking
me
what
I
mean
by
certain
sentences
and
asking
thought
provoking
questions,
I
am
able
to
omit
the
unnecessary
and
expand
upon
the
lacking.
As
a
rising
junior
in
college,
my
writing
memory
is
exceptionally
fresh
from
my
first
two
years
of
college.
As
an
incoming
freshman
I
declared
myself
a
Biology
major
and
registered
for
one
writing
class,
my
Freshman
Year
Seminar.
I
remember
being
the
most
comfortable
in
this
classroom.
Sure
the
three
hour
once
a
week
night
course
was
not
what
I
was
expecting,
but
it
changed
my
perspective
on
college
writing
all
together.
I
was
not
sure
if
it
was
the
class
I
had
chosen
or
the
professor,
but
there
were
no
boundaries,
and
I
loved
it.
The
topics
we
wrote
about
dealt
with
the
community
and
real
life
issues.
It
was
the
first
time
I
felt
like
I
was
writing
for
a
reason.
The
only
thing
that
was
set
in
stone
was
the
MLA
format,
which
was
not
an
issue
because
it
was
spoon-fed
to
me
in
high
school.
Besides
that,
I
noticed
I
still
needed
to
brain
storm,
write
rough
drafts,
and
yes
peer
edit.
Except
it
was
different
from
peer
editing
than
high
school.
This
time
I
was
given
my
own
Associate.
I
can
remember
my
first
meeting
with
my
Writing
Associate.
I
thought
it
was
such
an
inventive
idea
to
give
students,
especially
new
students,
help
from
an
older
and
more
experienced
writer.
I
felt
comfortable
asking
my
WA
questions
that
I
did
not
necessarily
want
to
ask
my
professor.
The
last
thing
I
wanted
to
do
was
to
make
a
bad
impression
or
ask
a
NstupidO
question
so
I
was
extremely
thankful
to
have
a
student
to
email
and
meet
with.
One
of
the
most
valuable
tools
I
used
during
my
first
year
of
college,
besides
my
Writing
Associate,
was
a
free
writing
activity.
This
technique
was
a
way
for
my
professor
to
get
our
creativity
flowing.
She
would
give
us
a
topic
and
set
a
timer.
In
the
time
period
we
were
to
write
down
anything
and
everything
that
came
to
mind.
I
used
adjectives,
phrases,
and
pictures,
anything
that
popped
into
my
head.
When
time
was
up
I
was
left
with
innumerable
ideas
that
I
did
not
know
I
even
had.
I
use
the
free
writing
technique
to
this
day
before
every
paper;
I
am
convinced
there
is
no
better
cure
for
writerOs
block.
After
my
Freshman
Year
Seminar
I
realized
that
college
writing
is
not
based
on
the
quantity
of
the
writing,
as
I
expected,
it
was
the
quality.
I
learned
to
be
more
specific
and
detailed
and
to
be
less
broad
in
my
papers.
I
remember
realizing
that
through
group
discussion
and
sharing
my
writing
with
others
that
college
level
writing
is
simply
impressive.
I
am
constantly
impressed
by
how
different
papers
on
the
same
topic
can
be.
I
am
fascinated
by
the
language
used
by
other
students
my
age,
and
am
grateful
for
the
inspiration
that
I
received
from
them.
I
was
so
impressed
by
my
Freshman
Year
Seminar
that
second
semester
I
decided
to
take
an
American
studies
class
in
addition
to
my
college
writing
class.
It
was
more
writing
than
I
had
ever
done
but
I
found
that
the
writing
classes
I
took
were
refreshing
in
comparison
to
the
lab
reports
I
had
been
writing.
Between
my
first
two
years
at
Lafayette
College
I
have
written
papers
in
genres
like
community
art,
American
history,
personal
reflections,
current
events,
religion,
food,
race,
and
disasters.
I
have
written
lab
reports
in
Biology,
Chemistry,
Psychology,
and
Organic
Chemistry.
I
accredit
that
to
the
fact
that
Lafayette
is
a
liberal
arts
college.
Now
as
s
a
Neuroscience
major
I
enjoy
the
ability
to
take
a
break
from
science
classes
and
structured
lab
reports
to
go
to
the
library
and
brainstorm
for
a
paper
in
one
of
my
other
required
classes.
I
thoroughly
appreciate
the
writing
program
at
Lafayette
College
and
I
am
proud
to
be
anew
member
of
the
Writing
Associates
Community.
I
hope
that
as
I
continue
to
develop
my
own
writing
history
that
I
can
help
shape
the
writing
history
of
another
fellow
student.
