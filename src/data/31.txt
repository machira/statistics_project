The
History
of
a
Writer
It
wasn't
a
inspirational
poem
that
first
spurned
my
interest
in
writing.
Nor
was
it
a
bucket
of
cold
water
thrown
in
my
face.
My
history
as
a
writer
stemmed
from
a
myriad
of
wires
and
microchips
that
were
set
before
me
at
the
age
of
fourteen;
not
exactly
your
typical
beginning.
For
the
first
time
I
was
allowed
to
adjust
or
erase
any
unperfected
thought
without
tearing
the
page
or
having
a
pile
of
eraser
residue
in
my
lap.
As
technology
progressed,
the
organizational
side
of
me
let
more
of
my
creativeness
leak
through
the
keyboard.
A
writer
of
the
nineties
would
encompass
this
evolution
best.
From
my
first
written
character
to
this
very
day,
no
piece
of
writing
was
acceptable
unless
it
was
neat
and
legible.
I
remember
in
first
grade
when
Mrs.
Volwinkle
gave
the
class
a
piece
of
tan
paper
with
a
total
of
two
lines
on
each
page.
Every
applicable
letter
had
to
perfectly
touch
the
top
and
the
bottom
of
the
line.
Otherwise
its
existence
was
demolished
by
my
rubber
eraser.
The
more
writing
I
was
asked
to
do,
the
more
frustrated
I
became.
I
found
myself
taking
twice
the
time
to
finish
an
assignment
as
my
classmates.
The
acquisition
of
a
computer
alleviated
this
tension
immediately.
Everything
I
wrote
was
already
perfect
in
size
and
style.
This
machine
wiped
out
years
of
anguish
and
sore
arms,
and
offered
my
mind
a
chance
to
concentrate
on
what
I
was
writing
instead
of
how
I
was
writing
it.
Just
as
the
right
sneakers
or
equipment
don't
make
the
superstar
athlete,
I
found
that
my
computer
only
went
so
far
in
my
development
as
a
writer.
While
the
page
appeared
crisp
and
clean,
more
frustration
arose
with
the
jumbled
content
of
the
paper.
I
needed
a
trainer
or
coach
to
push
me.
My
true
experience
as
a
writer
really
began
in
high
school
with
the
help
of
two
teachers.
Both
of
these
coaches
helped
me
work
out
these
kinks
that
had
been
slowing
my
writing
down.
I
walked
into
my
junior
year
English
class
to
sit
before
the
most
incredible
pair
of
legs
I
had
ever
seen.
Luckily
my
girlfriend
sat
in
front
of
me
and
could
not
see
that
every
male
in
the
room
had
already
fallen
in
love
with
Ms
Weiss.
Unlike
the
rest
of
my
slobbering
peers,
I
was
able
to
break
out
of
my
stupor
and
take
in
what
this
brilliant
woman
had
to
say.
I
can
still
feel
my
sense
of
relief
when
she
announced
that
every
essay
did
not
have
to
be
five
paragraphs
long.
This
couldn't
be
right.
Was
I
actually
free
to
think
and
express
any
thought
at
any
length?
I
had
spent
the
previous
three
years
getting
the
five
paragraph
format
drilled
into
my
head.
I
felt
sort
of
rebellious
passing
the
five
paragraph
mark
with
three
more
still
stirring
in
my
head.
The
main
focus
of
that
year
surrounded
the
organization
of
ideas.
I
was
taught
and
still
feel
today
that
the
introductory
paragraph
can
make
or
break
a
paper.
I
found
myself
spending
hours
forming
the
introduction
of
every
paper
so
that
I
could
somehow
catch
Ms.
Weiss's
attention.
What
gave
me
the
most
satisfaction
was
that
I
was
allowed
to
be
creative
and
even
use
humor
to
begin
a
school
related
paper.
At
this
point
I
pondered
the
possibility
of
actually
enjoying
writing.
I
receded
better
grades
with
this
new
found
freedom
and
several
positive
comments
from
Ms.
Weiss.
For
the
first
time
I
felt
that
writing
was
really
worth
something.
While
my
junior
year
gave
me
a
good
basis
and
confidence
in
my
writing,
it
was
my
senior
year
that
launched
me
into
a
world
far
beyond
my
previous
writing
realm.
I
attribute
most
of
myself
as
a
writer
to
the
creative
writing
class
I
took
from
Mrs.
Vreeland.
Frail
and
gentle,
she
was
quite
the
opposite
of
my
knockout
teacher
from
the
year
before.
I
found
myself
falling
asleep
in
class
not
because
she
was
boring,
but
because
of
her
soft,
nurturing
voice.
What
she
had
to
convey
however,
has
had
a
powerful
impact
on
my
life.
It
was
a
cold,
dark
day
when
Mrs.
Vreeland
handed
us
back
our
first
assignment.
Thunder
boomed
in
my
head
as
I
stared
at
the
D
on
my
paper.
She
explained
that
my
writing
was
vague
and
she
would
quickly
change
that.
I
never
thought
that
instruction
on
creative
writing
was
possible.
How
can
someone
tell
me
that
my
thoughts
or
expressions
are
wrong?
I
quickly
found
out
that
just
analytical
writing
has
its
structures
and
rules,
creative
writing
must
be
have
a
thought
process
and
uniformity
to
it.
Our
first
and
most
important
lesson
was
on
the
use
of
details.
Mrs.
Vreeland
explained
that
details
were
the
key
to
capturing
a
readers
attention.
Why
should
someone
read
a
story
about
your
dog
unless
it
was
unique
from
every
other
dog
in
the
world?
This
dog
must
have
the
fullest
coat,
the
brightest
eyes,
and
the
sloppiest
tongue
for
anyone
to
care.
While
describing
our
dogs
on
paper
wasn't
such
an
arduous
task,
sharing
our
descriptions
was
the
biggest
obstacle
that
our
class
came
across.
I
remember
the
look
of
dread
and
fear
that
blanketed
my
classmate's
faces
as
Mrs.
Vreeland
called
us
into
critiquing
groups.
Fortunately
for
me,
I
enjoyed
sharing
my
writing
with
others.
I
felt
a
tremendous
sense
of
pride
and
accomplishment
as
my
peers
complimented
my
writing.
I
discovered
that
my
writing
was
usually
superior
to
that
of
my
class.
For
the
first
time
in
my
academic
career
I
had
people
asking
me
questions
and
respecting
me
for
my
work.
After
going
through
several
months
of
practice
and
discussion
with
these
groups,
I
realized
why
I
had
never
been
able
to
keep
a
journal.
I've
had
my
share
of
diaries
and
journals
given
to
me.
Every
time
I
got
a
new
one
I
would
write
in
it
the
first
day
never
to
open
it
again.
I
came
to
the
conclusion
that
if
I
was
going
to
take
the
time
and
effort
to
express
myself
and
my
thoughts,
than
I
was
going
show
it
to
someone
who
would
appreciate
it.
I
believe
that
writing
is
an
art
and
deserves
to
be
on
display
just
as
a
painting
does.
If
people
enjoyed
reading
about
my
life
and
my
viewpoints,
why
shouldn't
I
let
them?
It
makes
perfect
sense
that
I
loved
sharing
my
writing
with
others.
But
what
I
still
can't
figure
out
is
the
fact
that
I
receive
more
pleasure
from
reading
and
advising
others
in
their
work.
Maybe
because
it
took
less
time
to
do.
When
I
see
a
piece
of
writing
that
I've
never
read
before,
it
is
easier
to
locate
the
weak
spots.
Maybe
it
was
the
thanks
I
got
from
those
that
I
helped.
It
could
also
be
my
teacher's
recognition
of
this
skill
and
her
praise.
But
one
thing
stood
clear,
I
had
learned
enough
about
the
basic
parameters
of
writing
that
my
assistance
became
a
commodity
in
the
classroom.
So
what
if
I
wrote
creatively
and
could
help
others
with
a
similar
task?
How
is
this
going
to
help
me
in
the
academic
world?
Unless
I
became
a
writer,
which
I
wasn't
planning
on
doing,
this
new
found
confidence
would
be
useless
to
me.
Fortunately,
I
was
able
to
use
many
of
these
skills
in
research-based
and
analytical
writing.
This
was
most
significant
in
my
introductions.
My
English
teacher
suggested
that
rather
than
trying
to
make
some
philosophical
statement,
I
should
try
beginning
a
paper
creatively.
Paint
a
picture
or
say
something
outrageous
as
long
as
it
was
relevant
and
it
captured
the
reader's
attention.
After
testing
the
waters
with
various
introductory
methods,
it
came
time
to
prove
myself
as
a
writer.
It
was
college
essay
day.
It
was
easy
getting
Mrs.
Vreeland
to
read
my
writing.
Hell,
she
knew
that
I
had
something
interesting
to
say
and
it
was
worth
finishing
my
papers.
But
what
about
a
college
admission
officer?
What
incentive
did
they
have
to
read
mine
when
they
had
thousands
of
others
to
look
over.
It
took
days,
but
I
finally
came
up
with
an
intro-
paragraph
with
a
detailed
description
of
spit
and
food
flying
from
my
father's
mouth
as
he
screamed
at
me
for
my
sophomore
year
grades.
While
it
wasn't
the
most
pleasant
piece
of
writing,
it
had
humor
and
relevance
to
my
purpose.
Most
importantly
it
got
the
job
done.
College
would
be
easy,
right?
Afterall,
I
was
one
of
the
best
writers
in
my
class
and
it
was
something
that
I
really
enjoyed.
My
first-year
seminar
changed
much
of
this
false
confidence
very
quickly.
It
wasn't
that
I
had
forgotten
all
that
I
had
learned
in
high
school.
My
viewpoints
were
interesting
and
I
backed
them
with
several
sources.
My
grade
school
English
classes
had
failed
to
teach
me
the
type
of
writing
that
my
professor
desired.
I
was
always
taught
to
take
a
side
of
an
issue,
discus
the
conflict,
and
back
my
opinion
with
quotes
from
the
text.
But
my
FYS
professor
wanted
us
to
look
beyond
this.
What
was
the
use
of
our
viewpoint
if
we
couldn't
see
other
side
of
the
argument?
My
paper
was
not
only
more
interesting,
but
it
held
a
sense
of
validity
if
I
could
discredit
any
opposing
claims.
I
found
that
while
this
was
more
difficult,
it
stimulated
my
mind
to
think
differently.
I
had
to
position
myself
from
the
standpoint
of
another
person
in
order
to
see
the
various
facets
of
a
conflict.
By
the
time
I
was
finished
with
my
FYS
class,
I
had
done
so
much
political
and
analytical
writing,
I
didn't
think
I
could
go
back
to
reading
a
book
and
just
merely
discuss
it.
Surprisingly,
my
first
English
class
in
college
was
very
similar
to
my
first-year
seminar.
I
was
asked
to
look
at
the
broad
spectrum
of
an
issue.
Another
part
of
the
class
that
I
was
prepared
for
was
our
critique
groups.
While
it
had
been
a
year
since
my
last
experience
with
this,
I
picked
up
on
it
very
quickly
and
was
able
distinguish
myself
from
the
class.
I
am
usually
very
modest
and
I
don't
take
compliments
extremely
well,
but
I
couldn't
help
feel
a
bit
of
an
ego
trip
when
my
professor
said
that
my
comments
on
student's
papers
were
the
best
she
had
ever
seen.
My
goodness,
a
professor
whose
taught
here
fifteen
years
said
that?!
I
felt
extremely
flattered
and
a
bit
nervous.
I
knew
that
a
lot
would
be
expected
of
me
for
the
duration
of
the
semester.
Little
did
I
know
what
a
problem
this
would
become.
Last
semester
I
struggled
only
because
I
couldn't
apply
my
editing
skills
to
my
own
papers.
I
was
a
far
better
advisor
to
other's
work
than
to
my
own.
I
had
experienced
this
in
high
school
but
I
was
a
good
enough
writer
to
get
away
with
it.
While
my
work
was
still
good
in
college,
there
were
several
aspects
of
my
writing
that
my
professor
insisted
that
I
work
on.
She
agreed
that
my
introductions
were
spectacular,
but
I
often
lost
focus
in
the
middle
of
the
paper.
While
it
was
essential
that
I
capture
the
reader's
interest,
it
was
also
important
to
keep
it.
I
feel
that
I
was
more
than
adequately
prepared
for
the
writing
demands
at
Lafayette.
In
terms
of
workload,
I
had
it
a
bit
easier
than
many
of
my
first
year
peers.
Even
so,
I
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
my
experience
this
previous
year.
I
thought
that
I
would
attain
a
vast
array
of
writing
techniques
and
styles.
Although
I
did
learn
a
lot
about
presenting
an
argument
and
improving
many
aspects
of
my
writing,
I
expected
a
bit
more.
Fortunately
or
unfortunately
for
me,
I
have
three
more
years
of
papers,
essays,
and
a
thesis
to
work
on.
I'll
probably
be
eating
my
words
by
this
time
next
year.
