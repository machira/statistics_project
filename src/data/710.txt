rHow
hard
can
it
be
to
sit
down
with
a
fellow
student
and
talk
about
their
writing?
Ium
pretty
good
on
my
feet
and
Ium
sure
I
can
think
of
something
that
will
make
sense
to
them
and
allow
for
a
productive
meeting.s
These
were
the
kind
of
thoughts
going
through
my
head
before
I
sat
down
for
my
very
first
WA
conference
during
the
fall
semester
of
2010.
I
had
been
through
the
orientation
and
felt
comfortable
with
the
topics
we
talked
about
during
the
workshop;
how
to
be
facilitative
rather
than
directive
or
corrective,
how
to
get
the
student
feeling
comfortable
when
talking
about
their
writing
and
their
understanding
of
the
assignment,
and
finally,
how
to
ensure
that
they
felt
our
conference
was
valuable
to
their
writing
process.
All
of
these
things
sounded
pretty
easy
to
me
in
theory,
yet
after
about
23
seconds
into
my
first
conference,
I
realized
that
the
marriage
between
theory
and
practice
was
not
going
to
be
as
easy
as
I
had
originally
thought.
My
first
conference
started
innocently
enough
p
the
student
was
comfortable
in
answering
my
questions
about
how
the
class
was
going
and
how
she
understood
the
assignment.
However,
when
I
began
asking
questions
about
specific
areas
in
her
writing,
she
looked
at
me
doe-eyed
and
her
neck
craned
to
the
right.
I
immediately
began
to
feel
like
an
alien
rather
than
a
Writing
Associate,
the
student
looked
at
me
as
if
she
had
just
seen
me
arrive
in
the
Watt
Writing
Room
via
the
glowing
circular
orb
that
pop-culture
tells
us
transports
all
aliens
from
the
bottom
of
their
spaceship
to
earth.
After
finishing
three
consecutive
conferences
on
my
first
day,
I
quickly
realized
that
I
would
need
to
go
back
to
square
one
and
reevaluate
my
understanding
of
the
steps
of
the
writing
process,
the
different
ways
individuals
learn
and
work
through
complex
topics,
and
finally,
how
my
own
experiences
as
a
student
writer
shaped
my
approach
as
a
writing
associate.
I
decided
that
I
needed
to
relearn
everything
I
knew
about
successful
writing
processes
(from
beginning
organization
to
offering
a
finished
product)
in
order
to
be
able
to
clearly
articulate
my
ideas
to
the
students
I
was
working
with.
This
paper
serves
to
diagram
the
relearning
process
I
had
to
experience
in
order
to
be
an
effective
writing
associate
and
also
strives
to
deconstruct
the
relationship
between
myself
the
writing
associate
and
myself
the
writer.
Examining
how
the
cooperative
element
of
the
Writing
Associate
program
aided
in
my
evolution
as
a
writer
and
a
writing
associate
and
analyzing
specific
examples
of
how
my
writing
conferences
became
increasingly
more
successful
as
the
semester
progressed
illustrates
how
important
it
was
for
me
to
step
back
and
relearn
what
it
means
to
be
a
writer
and
how
the
writing
process
is
constructed.
One
of
the
most
valuable
components
of
the
WA
program
is
its
communal
nature.
Some
of
the
most
compelling
moments
of
my
relearning
process
take
place
in
staff
meetings
and
side
conversations
with
fellow
WAs.
David
Bartholomeaus
rInventing
the
Universitys
has
been
one
of
the
pillars
of
my
understanding
of
the
writing
process
and
being
successful
and
connecting
with
student
writers.
After
reading
Bartholomaeus
piece
and
discussing
it
in
the
staff
meeting,
it
became
apparent
to
me
that
the
doe-eyed
look
I
was
receiving
when
I
tried
to
shift
into
specific
questions
about
a
studentus
writing
had
a
lot
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
invented
university
I
had
become
so
familiar
with
in
my
first
two
years
on
campus
was
one
that
was
totally
foreign
to
the
student
fresh
out
of
high
school.
Bartholomae
writes
that
students
have
to
rappropriate
(or
be
appropriated
by)
a
specialized
discourse,
and
they
do
this
as
though
they
were
easily
and
comfortably
one
with
their
audience,
as
though
they
were
members
of
the
academy,
or
historians
or
anthropologists
or
economists;
they
have
to
invent
the
university
by
assembling
and
mimicking
its
languageis
(Bartholomae
403).
As
students,
we
are
conditioned
to
cater
our
writing
to
audiences
and
to
academic
disciplines
p
yet
this
is
not
always
a
natural
response
or
progression.
As
a
student
experiences
more
and
more
classes
that
push
this
conditioning
the
student
becomes
less
aware
that
the
conditioning
is
even
taking
place
and
begins
writing
in
the
invented
language
they
know
is
what
the
class
or
discipline
has
preapproved.
Being
a
junior,
I
had
two
years
of
conditioning
under
my
belt
p
I
was
becoming
a
stallion
within
my
invented
university;
throwing
around
terms
such
as
rtextss
rmetatextss
and
rclose
readingss
with
such
ease
that
the
doe-eyed
freshman
I
was
working
with
probably
thought
Lafayette
had
fully
brainwashed
students
in
their
first
two
years
on
campus.
I
struggled
with
the
fact
that
I
would
need
to
find
a
way
to
temporarily
forget
about
the
personal
university
I
had
invented
and
start
from
the
ground
floor
with
the
freshman
I
was
working
with.
Despite
my
reservations
about
whether
or
not
I
could
be
successful
at
helping
others
begin
to
integrate
themselves
with
the
integrated
university,
the
ideas
I
hear
from
the
other
WAs
helped
me
become
more
comfortable
with
this
idea.
The
conversation
in
the
WA
staff
meeting
after
the
Bartholomae
reading
had
been
assigned
was
hugely
beneficial
to
my
evolution
as
a
writing
associate
who
was
now
distancing
himself
from
the
invented
university
he
had
become
familiar
with
and
stepping
into
the
unfamiliar
world
a
freshman
faces
while
in
their
first
semester
of
college.
The
veteran
Writing
Associates
talked
about
the
value
of
the
facilitative
approach
when
working
with
a
student
who
was
facing
a
new
style
of
writing
and
being
told
to
think
about
texts
in
a
way
that
was
foreign
to
them.
By
asking
questions
about
the
student
writerus
understanding
of
the
prompt
and
the
language
in
which
it
was
composed
I
began
to
understand
where
their
basic
idea
for
their
paper
originated
and
how
they
approached
the
task
of
writing
in
a
way
that
aligned
with
the
invented
university
they
had
been
exposed
to
in
their
FYS.
With
the
theory
of
an
invented
university
and
the
value
of
the
facilitative
approach
fresh
in
my
mind,
my
conferences
began
to
become
more
successful.
Rather
than
me
half-believing
a
student
when
they
responded
yes
to
my
question
rdoes
this
make
sense
to
you?s
I
genuinely
began
to
feel
like
I
was
connecting
with
the
students.
While
the
relearning
process
I
was
experiencing
as
it
related
to
the
invented
university
and
how
to
talk
to
students
about
making
changes
to
their
writing
had
a
huge
impact
on
the
effectiveness
of
the
conferences,
I
had
also
started
to
realize
that
working
on
the
personal
element
of
the
conferences
was
just
as
important
as
focusing
on
the
writing
itself.
While
I
may
have
started
to
truly
feel
comfortable
talking
to
students,
they
needed
to
begin
to
feel
truly
comfortable
talking
to
me.
Having
a
conversation
is
so
important
to
the
facilitative
approach;
if
the
students
could
not
begin
to
answer
the
questions
I
pose
then
the
method
was
flawed.
Many
times
students
came
to
significant
realizations
when
listening
to
their
answers
to
my
questions
about
their
writing.
I
found
that
patience
was
the
most
important
component
in
my
attempt
to
create
an
atmosphere
that
allowed
the
student
to
feel
comfortable
answering
my
questions.
If
I
made
it
clear
that
there
was
no
right
answer
to
my
questions,
rather
that
the
thoughts
that
go
behind
the
answer
itself
are
what
are
most
important
since
they
expose
what
the
student
does
and
does
not
feel
comfortable
with
in
terms
of
the
assignment,
then
our
conversations
would
really
open
up.
One
of
most
difficult
tasks
for
me
was
to
accept
quiet
during
the
conferences.
I
am
by
nature
a
talkative
person
and
my
internal
awkward
meter
rises
very
quickly
with
every
passing
second
of
silence.
Yet
silence
was
a
necessary
offering
to
the
students,
a
physical
sign
that
I
was
not
going
to
sit
there
and
craft
a
right
answer
for
them,
I
was,
rather,
going
to
let
them
figure
out
why
they
wrote
what
they
did
and
how
their
writing
connected
to
the
message
they
were
trying
to
get
across.
If
the
silence
became
painful
for
the
both
of
us,
I
would
ask
the
student
if
they
understood
my
question.
Sometimes
in
their
answer
to
my
question,
I
myself
realized
that
I
did
not
even
understand
what
I
was
trying
to
get
at
originally.
Telling
the
student,
ryou
know
what;
I
donut
think
I
worded
that
correctlys,
caused
their
guard
to
lower
and
for
them
to
realize
that
I
was
just
a
fellow
student
trying
to
make
sense
of
the
question
and
the
best
way
to
approach
answering
it
in
a
lucid
piece
of
writing.
Just
as
patience
and
admitting
that
I
did
not
always
have
a
clear
answer
to
the
prompt
or
to
other
questions
students
would
have
for
me
allowed
them
to
become
more
comfortable
with
me,
I
began
to
realize
that
if
I
took
a
few
other
steps
to
make
the
students
more
relaxed
at
every
conference,
they
outcome
of
the
conference
was
usually
a
positive
one.
At
the
beginning
of
the
conference,
I
would
never
go
right
into
talking
about
the
assignment
itself.
I
would
ask
about
how
the
studentus
classes
are
going,
how
the
year
is
going,
whether
they
are
having
fun
and
so
on.
By
getting
the
conversation
started
this
way,
I
noticed
that
it
was
easy
to
shift
into
talking
about
the
paper
and
keep
the
pace
of
our
conversation
strong.
Another
keystone
in
my
development
as
a
WA
was
the
idea
that
a
draft
or
an
outline
was
often
times
a
better
piece
to
examine
than
a
finished
product.
Some
of
the
most
muddled
pieces
of
writing
I
dealt
with
were
also
usually
the
longest.
Many
times
they
started
out
decently
enough
but
shifted
into
a
hectic
hop-scotch
like
method
of
shifting
from
idea
to
idea
with
little
cohesion.
Since
I
had
done
my
best
to
make
it
clear
that
I
was
going
to
rely
on
the
facilitative
approach
and
ask
questions
about
the
studentsu
writing
process
rather
than
directing
them
what
to
do,
I
frequently
posed
the
question:
rdid
you
find
yourself
struggling
to
get
to
the
assigned
page
requirements
for
this
paper?s
This
question
was
almost
universally
met
with
the
response
ryes.s
I
then
asked
them
if
they
had
made
an
outline
or
did
any
other
type
of
prep
work
before
sitting
down
and
typing
away.
For
those
who
replied
yes,
I
asked
them
to
take
me
through
their
planning
stages
and
would
interject
when
I
saw
moments
in
their
paper
that
strayed
from
the
thoughts
that
had
expressed
during
the
planning
phase.
For
those
who
explained
that
they
did
not
do
any
type
of
outlining
before
writing
the
paper,
I
asked
them
if
it
was
OK
if
we
made
a
rgame
plans
together.
Working
together
on
an
outline
allowed
me
to
gauge
their
understanding
of
the
question
being
asked
and
formulate
how
they
could
effectively
articulate
the
response
they
wanted
to
offer
and
the
examples
they
wanted
to
use
to
support
that
response.
Working
with
the
students
on
an
outline
was
probably
the
one
area
I
felt
the
most
improvement
as
a
WA
during
the
semester.
It
did
not
come
naturally
to
me;
instead,
I
became
more
articulate
at
expressing
to
students
how
an
outline
could
help
their
writing
process
as
the
semester
continued
and
by
the
end
found
them
coming
to
me
with
the
same
type
of
outline
we
had
completed
together
on
a
previous
paper,
which
was
very
rewarding.
The
conversations
I
had
with
students
regarding
the
organization
that
was
important
to
every
phase
of
the
writing
process
were
very
beneficial
to
my
own
abilities
as
a
writer.
After
getting
increasingly
comfortable
with
a
set
of
questions
that
I
found
were
accessible
to
students
when
talking
about
their
game
plan
for
the
paper,
I
began
to,
without
even
realizing
it,
ask
myself
the
same
questions
as
I
was
doing
my
own
writing.
Helping
students
make
sense
of
the
prompts
they
were
answering
and
the
texts
they
were
working
with
caused
me
to
become
a
more
focused
writer
when
I
sat
down
to
plan
an
essay.
I
had
begun
to
expect
problem
areas
that
were
common
in
the
students
writing
and
then
look
for
those
problems
in
my
own
writing,
and
I
usually
found
them.
For
example,
the
question
of
the
most
effective
placement
of
a
quote
as
it
attempted
to
support
an
idea
was
an
issue
that
was
frequently
discussed
in
my
meetings
with
students
and
consequently,
was
an
area
of
my
writing
that
improved
as
I
was
finding
myself
being
more
critical
about
the
relevance
of
the
quote.
A
big
part
of
this
evolution
was
the
fact
that
I
was
becoming
more
comfortable
in
questioning
the
invented
universities
(since
I
had
been
working
in
different
disciplines)
that
I
had
become
familiar
with
and
as
a
result
was
realizing
that
I,
like
many
of
the
students
I
worked
with,
had
slipped
into
a
method
that
was
not
something
I
could
apply
universally
to
all
of
my
writing.
Ironically,
helping
students
get
comfortable
with
the
idea
of
working
within
the
constraints
of
an
invented
university
allowed
me
to
distance
myself
from
the
different
models
I
had
become
too
familiar
with,
models
that
made
my
approach,
and
my
finished
product,
unoriginal.
As
the
beginning
of
this
paper
made
clear,
one
of
the
most
challenging
aspects
of
my
experience
as
a
Writing
Associate
has
been
stepping
out
of
my
comfort
zone
and
back
to
square
one,
both
as
a
writer,
and
as
a
student
whose
purpose
is
to
help
others
with
their
writing.
The
realization
that
the
students
genuinely
relied
on
me
to
help
with
their
abilities
as
writers
was
more
intimidating
then
I
had
assumed
it
would
be.
Yet
the
experience
of
relearning
what
I
had
gotten
too
familiar
with
in
terms
of
understanding
the
writing
process
was
hugely
rewarding.
The
fact
that
my
relearning
took
place
in
the
communal
environment
of
the
Writing
Associate
program
was
the
main
reason
that
the
evolution
was
rewarding;
other
students
offered
their
advice
and
past
experiences
in
staff
meetings
and
in
casual
conversation
and
as
a
result
I
was
able
to
allow
others
to
help
guide
me
rather
than
trying
to
do
it
myself,
which
is
usually
less
effective
and
more
trying.
By
the
end
of
the
2010
fall
semester
I
had
developed
a
nice
rapport
with
the
class
I
had
been
working
with
and
they
seemed
to
genuinely
consider
me
beneficial
to
their
writing
process.
Ultimately,
that
fact
was
the
most
rewarding
part
of
the
experience
and
a
feeling
I
look
forward
to
reliving
this
semester.
Going
into
my
last
year
on
campus,
I
plan
on
continuing
to
relearn
what
I
thought
I
had
fully
understood
and
am
open
to
the
idea
that
my
methods
as
WA
may
change
significantly
given
the
class
I
will
be
paired
with.
No
matter
what
happens,
I
look
forward
to
sharing
my
progress
during
staff
meetings
and
participating
in
another
reflection
like
this
one
as
my
college
career
comes
to
an
end.
