LITERACY
NARRATIVE
by
I
suppose
writing
is
more
closely
related
in
meaning
to
the
word
communicating
than
to
the
process
of...
making
words
appear
on
slate,
paper,
or
computer
screen.
When
I
think
about
learning
to
write
I
don't
seem
to
recollect
learning
the
alphabet
or
practicing
correct
spelling.
My
earliest
recollection
of
writing
brings
forth
the
fond
image
of
a
little
blue
notebook
I
was
given
in
first
grade.
The
top
half
of
each
page
was
blank:
it
was
space
to
draw
the
picture
that
went
along
with
the
story.
Writing
then
was,
for
me,
a
way
to
breathe
life
into
the
limp
picture,
a
way
to
give
meaning
to
the
unsightly
shapes
drawn
with
colored
pencils.
Even
more
today
does
writing
become
a
way
of
self-expression
that
I
can
never
find
in
other
forms
of
art,
like
painting
for
example:
Although
any
painting
of
mine
today
would
cause
an
art
professor
to
jump
into
the
gaping
useless
hole
behind
Van
Wickle
Hall,
my
papers
have
yet
to
make
an
English
professor
queasy!
As
very
young
children
we
remember
a
very
strange
assortment
of
snipets
from
our
early
years.
One
such
strange
memory
is
of
my
first
grade
classroom.
I
am
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
table,
holding
this
little
blue
notebook.
I
remember
that
I
had
written
a
story
about
a
queen
of
sorts.
I
don't
remember
what
happened
to
the
queen
or
what
kind
of
queen
she
was.
All
I
do
remember
is
talking
to
a
friend
who
asks
to
see
my
story.
He
frowns:
Aw,
I
spelled
queen
correctly,
and
you
didn't,
but
Heather
[Heather
was
our
teacher]
didn't
make
a
mark
on
your
paper!
My
friend's
reaction
was
neither
unfair
nor
unkind.
In
fact
today
I
myself
would
wince
at
a
qween
(which
is
probably
the
way
I
spelled
the
word
fifteen
years
ago).
I
still
don't
know
why
I
remember
this
particular
conversation;
maybe
he
hurt
my
feelings
because
I
was
proud
of
my
story
and
he
ruined
the
sense
of
great
accomplishment
that
I
had
felt
prior
to
our
conversation.
The
point
here
is
that
my
dear
teacher
Heather
might
have
had
been
carefully
trying
to
avoid
causing
that
disappointment
with
the
whole
story
which
came
about
because
of
the
criticism
of
the
spelling
of
a
single
word.
Looking
back,
after
years
of
both
writing
and
WAing,
this
episode
is
a
simple
reminder
of
a
great
truth:
chop
down
the
little
trees,
one
at
a
time,
and
soon
there'll
be
no
forest!
I
hope
I
remember
this
little
story
every
now
and
then
because
I,
too,
sometimes,
overextend
my
welcome
on
the
territory
of
someone
else's
paper.
If
I
annoy
the
Writer
(oh,
say,
my
poor
roommate)
with
too
many
meticulous
spellchecks,
it
is
only
because
I
want
to
give
the
paper
the
ultimate
respect
it
deserves
which
it
won't
get,
even
if
it
is
a
very
thoughtful
and
intelligent
work,
if
their
is
there
and
you're
your
.
However,
such
zealous
proofreading
sometimes
makes
writers,
especially
those
who
are
uncertain
and
shy,
grab
the
paper
and
hide
it,
as
if
they
are
hiding
a
monstrous
creation
the
thought
of
which
brings
hot
tears
of
shame
to
the
eye.
Many
times
at
conferences
I
can
recognize
these
bashful
but
wonderful
writers,
and
as
much
as
I
want
to
weed
out
the
errors
,
I
cross
my
fingers,
hope
that
the
student
uses
the
CTRL-F2
button
before
he
or
she
hands
in
the
paper,
and
I
try
to
listen
to
the
writing,
not
read
it.
Then
the
story
unfolds
and
the
writing
is
intelligent
like
the
mind
that
wrote
it
and
not
the
fingers
that
typed
it.
Years
went
by
and
the
little
blue
notebook
was
replaced
first
by
narrow-ruled
paper
and
then
by
a
computer
screen.
The
stories
about
mysterious
queens
were
replaced
by
a
whole
spectrum
of
writing:
from
formal
research
papers
on
the
effects
of
totalitarianism
on
human
rights
to
lugubrious
poems
(my
early
poems
would
have
made
Gerard
Manley
Hopkins
shed
a
compassionate
tear!).
Some
of
my
writing
during
those
fifteen
years
was
done
by
choice
and
some
was
done
as
an
assignment.
However,
the
quality
of
my
writing
had
(and
still
has)
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
act
was
voluntary
or
compulsory.
Quality,
in
my
case,
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
writing
allows
for
adequate
self-expression:
whether
or
not
some
part
of
me,
as
a
distinct
and
breathing
writer,
can
shine
through
the
lines.
I
have
to
be
able
to
communicate
personality,
interests,
feeling,
stance,
etc.,
through
my
writing,
no
matter
the
genre.
Otherwise
the
writing
is
dull
and
lifeless
and
limp
like
a
really
bad
handshake.
There
has
also
been
Other
Writing,
the
writing
that
nobody
is
allowed
to
read,
the
communication
between
Me
and
I:
the
Diary!
And
although
it
has
never
been
lifeless
and
boring,
that
kind
of
writing
is
never
quite
complete
enough
or
comprehendible
enough
for
anyone
else
to
read
(It
is,
however,
a
vast
goldmine
for
incredible
one-liners!).
The
little
qween
story
I
told
above
reveals
something
else
about
writing:
that
it
is
a
deeply
personal
process
for
most
of
us.
Some
of
us
freely
welcome
outside
comment
on
our
writing
without
offense
or
fear.
The
rest
of
us
are
reluctant
to
share,
fear
the
terrible
comments
that
our
writing
absolutely
must
draw
from
disgusted
readers,
and
feel
the
criticism
with
every
single
pain
sensor
in
our
bodies.
I,
sadly,
belong
to
the
latter
category:
I
grow
an
ecstatic
foot
taller
when
I
hear
praise
of
my
writing
but
I
shrink
ten
miserably
miserable
feet
when
someone
criticizes
it.
Luckily,
I
am
now
a
proud
5
foot
6
inches
tall
(and
not
a
negative
3
miles
and
4
feet
in
height:
I
would
have
trouble
finding
an
interview
suit
in
that
size!).
I
have
been
very
lucky
for
I
have
had
the
chance
to
cultivate
school
writing
in
a
very
personal,
very
individual-sensitive
environment.
There
were
never
more
than
twelve
students
in
my
high
school
English
classes
and
our
teacher
could
therefore
spend
a
significant
amount
of
time
with
each
student's
paper,
getting
to
know
the
writing
in
the
same
careful
manner
that
one
would
get
acquainted
with
the
person
herself.
This
sensitive
reading
of
my
writing
throughout
high
school
was
the
one
and
only
reason
I
gathered
enough
courage
to
share
poetry
(or
some
semblance
thereof!)
with
another
person.
I
remember
our
first
Honors
English
class:
Masterpieces
of
Literature,
it
was
called.
The
first
writing
assignment
almost
made
me
do
something
I
had
never
done
before:
drop
a
class
because
I
was
afraid
of
the
work.
Instead,
however,
I
set
a
different
record:
I
wrote
and
I
wrote
and
I
wrote
and
I
deleted
and
I
had
created
a
poem
that
someone
else
was
allowed
to
read.
I
couldn't
wait
to
get
it
back
because
I
needed
approval
more
than
I
needed
oxygen
it
seemed.
The
teacher
had
handled
it
all
very
diplomatically:
he
did
not
sing
high
praise
because
the
poem
wasn't
all
that
much
of
a
masterpiece;
but
he
managed
to
somehow
write
just
the
right
number
of
comments
on
my
pale
paper
so
as
to
motivate
and
not
discourage.
Then
it
was
time
for
college.
I
received
the
colorful
and
friendly-sounding
Lafayette
brochure
and,
sitting
up
in
a
tree
in
the
yard,
I
excitedly
picked
out
all
the
English
classes
that
sounded
thrilling:
Madness
in
Literature,
Shakespeare,
etc.
etc.
There
were
many
others;
some
I've
taken
and
some
I'll
never
take
because
of
all
the
business
classes
I've
filled
my
schedule
with.
But
the
point
here
is
not
lost
love
(of
English)
(and
it's
not
lost!).
The
point
is
that
after
an
hour
of
wild
imaginings
about
delightful
English
assignments,
reality
hit
me
so
hard
I
felt
like
the
branch
broke
underneath
me
and
I
was
kissing
the
ground!
Who
was
I
to
presume
that
I
could
write
well
in
college!
The
fear
set
in.
Fear
sat
and
sat
and
gnawed
and
gnawed
and
mocked
and
mocked
and
made
me
shake.
I
could
copy
a
medical
description
of
a
pre-heart
attack
condition
from
my
roommate's
Human
Physiology
textbook,
but
I
think
it
will
suffice
to
say
that
Pardee
321
was
too
small
for
me
the
afternoon
when
our
first
college
writing
assignments
were
to
be
handed
back.
I
really
did
not
know
how
my
high
school
writing
skills
measured
up
to
college
expectations.
Once
I
got
that
assignment
back,
the
Fear
was
gone.
It's
not
that
my
writing
was
perfect:
it
was
far
from
it.
I
did,
however,
get
a
sense
of
where
I
stood
and
where
I
should
go
from
here.
I
found
out
when
and
how
my
writing
had
failed
or
succeeded
to
communicate
what
I
was
thinking
and
feeling.
Things
have
been
much
easier
since.
