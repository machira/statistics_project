Fall
1996
Writing
Associate
Workshop
Literacy
Narrative
Professor
Donahue
When
I
described
the
assignment
for
the
fall
1996
Writing
Associate
Workshop
to
my
mother,
she
jokingly
suggested
that
I
tackle
the
project
by
simply
collecting
each
of
my
papers
from
the
past
academic
year
and
assembling
a
portfolio
of
sorts.
Although
this
approach
would
certainly
serve
as
an
accurate
depiction
of
my
history
as
a
writer
in
the
last
year,
I
realized
it
would
not
reflect
the
hours
of
preparation,
writing
and
refining
I
devoted
to
each
paper.
Nor
could
one
who
glanced
at
the
physical
manuscripts,
with
their
letters
uniformly
printed
and
their
lines
doublespaced,
comprehend
the
way
in
which
each
assignment
contributed
to
my
development
as
a
writer.
Therefore,
I
opted
not
to
take
my
mother's
suggestion
but
instead
to
review
not
only
the
literacy
narrative
I
had
constructed
last
summer
but
also
the
pieces
I
had
written
in
one
year's
time.
As
I
recognized
redundancies,
cliches
and
awkward
sounding
sentences
in
writing
I
had
composed
within
the
last
year
and
as
I
reflected
upon
my
recent
writing
experiences,
the
notion
that
my
attitudes
about
writing
as
well
as
my
personal
style
are
ever
changing
became
apparent.
I
have
found
that
establishing
contact
various
professors
and
gaining
exposure
to
different
literary
styles
were
not
the
sole
influences
on
my
writing.
Working
as
a
WA
has
also
affected
the
manner
in
which
I
view
and
approach
my
own
writ
ing.
Sophomore
year
is
a
transitional
period
for
many
college
students.
A
sophomore,
much
like
a
freshman,
dabbles
in
various
disciplines,
trying
to
determine
which
areas
best
suit
his/her
interests
and
abilities.
However,
it
is
also
by
the
end
of
a
student's
second
year
at
Lafayette
College
that
he/she
must
declare
a
major.
Although
I,
as
a
student
with
an
undeclared
major,
had
the
freedom
to
enroll
in
classes
in
a
variety
of
disciplines,
I
chose
not
to
pursue
a
future
in
the
area
of
mathematics
or
science.
.
Rather
I
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
as
I
completed
the
two
required
semesters
of
math
and
of
science.
Recognizing
that
writing
is
an
integral
part
of
my
education,
I
chose
to
fill
my
two
sophomore
semesters
with
courses
which
required
a
great
deal
of
writing.
As
I
came
to
realize
that
my
interest
was
not
in
calculus
or
in
geology
but
was
in
government
and
philosophy,
I
sought
the
approval
necessary
to
create
an
individualized
major.
However,
as
I
underwent
this
process,
I
took
classes
not
only
in
the
areas
that
pertained
directly
to
my
major,
but
also
in
different
disciplines
such
as
English
and
Spanish
and
in
different
subfields
such
as
international
politics
and
political
theory.
Taking
a
variety
of
courses
has
challenged
not
only
the
way
I
think
but
especially
the
way
I
write.
In
retrospect,
I
realize
that
many
of
the
most
difficult
writing
experiences
were
in
fact
also
the
most
rewarding.
For
example,
during
the
fall
semester
I
was
a
student
in
an
international
politics
class
which
challenged
my
attitudes
and
approach
to
writing.
Throughout
the
semester
we
were
assigned
six
different
papers,
all
of
which
I
found
to
be
particularly
difficult.
Four
of
these
papers
were
to
be
three
to
four
pages
in
length;
the
remaining
two
were
to
be
one
to
two
pages
long.
Each
assignment
detailed
a
broad
topic,
such
as
the
origins
of
the
Cold
War.
After
reading
a
variety
of
viewpoints
from
various
authors,
the
professor
urged
us
to
organize
our
papers
so
that
we
first
analyzed
the
personalities
of
those
in
power
and
the
way
in
which
individuals
influenced
the
particular
conflict
or
resolution.
Secondly
we
were
to
discuss
the
domestic
systems
of
the
rival
states.
Then
we
were
expected
to
describe
the
stability
or
lack
thereof
in
the
international
system
and
lastly
to
reflect
upon
the
prevalent
ideas
of
the
time.
Although
the
material
on
which
the
paper
was
to
be
based
was
not
particularly
difficult
and
although
this
four
levels
of
analysis
format
was
not
complex,
attempting
to
condense
the
authors'
viewpoints
which
on
average
were
detailed
in
no
less
than
sixty
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
pages
was
a
frustrating
experience.
Admittedly,
one
of
my
writing
weaknesses
is
expressing
myself
both
succinctly
and
clearly.
However,
as
I
found
myself
and
others
struggling
with
these
papers,
I
expressed
the
thought
that
these
limits
were
unrealistic
to
the
professor.
Although
she
took
my
concerns
seriously,
she
never
altered
her
expectations.
Similarly,
I
did
not
change
my
writing
approach.
Although
I
conformed
to
the
style
of
writing
she
expected,
I
never
once
met
the
three
to
four
page
guideline,
for
I
felt
if
I
were
to
do
so
I
would
compromise
the
quality
of
my
work.
From
this
experience,
however,
I
learned
the
importance
of
communicating
with
a
professor,
even
if
it
is
after
a
piece
of
writing
has
been
assigned
a
grade.
Although
I
did
not
learn
a
great
deal
from
these
assignments
in
which
we
were
essentially
expected
to
summarize
the
ideas
of
others,
this
experience
has
reaffirmed
the
idea
that
one
must
always
keep
his/her
audience
in
mind
and
has
helped
me
to
recognize
that
I
have
definite
expectations
as
a
writer.
In
turn,
this
realization
allows
me
to
understand
that
the
students
with
whom
I
will
confer
have
their
own
personal
histories
and
therefore
their
own
standards.
I
realize
that
although
I
may
offer
suggestions,
there
will
most
definitely
be
times
when
these
student
writers
will
refuse
to
alter
their
style.
In
my
fall
semester
English
course.
Literary
Questions,
I
became
reacquainted
with
the
type
of
essay
to
which
I
was
exposed
in
high
school
where
one
analyzes
a
particular
text
and
subsequently
creates
an
argument.
Reading
a
diverse
selection
of
authors
from
the
poetry
of
Frank
O'Hara
and
Emily
Dickinson
to
the
novels
of
Zora
Neal
Hurston
and
Charles
Dickens
allowed
for
a
great
deal
of
freedom
in
selecting
paper
topics.
Although
the
professor
maintained
her
own
standards
by
imposing
definite
requirements
and
page
limits,
I
enjoyed
having
the
freedom
to
choose
the
text
on
which
to
write
and
the
area
upon
which
to
focus.
The
professor's
flexibility
allowed
me
to
write
my
first
essay
on
the
similarities
and
differences
between
the
two
versions
of
Emily
Dickinson's
Poem
310
and
later
to
establish
a
new
writing
identity
in
which
I
analyzed
Charles
Dickens'
Great
Expectations
from
a
historical
standpoint,
reading
his
novel
as
a
critique
of
the
British
criminal
justice
system.
I
maintained
this
writing
identity
for
my
final
paper
in
which
after
researching
many
new
historicist
criticisms,
I
analyzed
The
Tempest.
as
Shakespeare's
criticism
of
England's
imperialistic
behavior.
Although
a
professor
must
often
impose
rigid
guidelines.,
the
flexible
nature
of
these
assignments
encouraged
me
to
develop
a
new
literary
voice.
In
the
spring
of
my
sophomore
year,
I
enrolled
in
a
government
course,
a
class
whose
focus
directly
relayed
to
my
major
of
legal
and
social
philosophy.
Although
this
class
was
not
a
writing
class
per
se,
the
professor
assigned
two
extensive
writing
projects
in
which
we
had
to
assume
the
role
of
a
judge
in
a
Court
of
Appeals
and
then
accordingly
write
majority
and
dissenting
opinions.
As
the
professor
expected
a
command
not
only
of
the
legal
material,
but
of
grammar
and
style
as
well,
I
found
my
experience
as
a
WA
to
be
of
assistance.
Our
weekly
staff
meetings
where
we
discussed
both
grammar
and
style
in
workshops
such
as
the
paramedic
method
served
as
a
time
of
both
review
and
instruction.
As
a
consequence
of
being
exposed
to
a
diverse
body
of
writing
in
student
conferences,
in
WA
workshops
and
meetings
and
in
drop-in
sessions,
I
found
I
was
able
to
adapt
the
style
of
my
writing
to
meet
the
demands
of
these
assignments
which
mandated
that
I
create
a
new
voice,
that
of
a
sophisticated
and
experienced
legal
scholar.
Throughout
my
spring'
semester
Black
Writers
Class,
the
professor
directed
us
to
write
a
one
page
commentary-detailing
our
reactions
to
the
selection
we
had
read
and
discussed.
As
these
reaction
papers
were
not
graded,
I
approached
the
midterm
assignment
to
construct
a
critical
essay
with
some
anxiety.
Uncertain
of
the
professor's,
expectations
and
aware
that
the
grade
we
received
on
this
paper
would
affect
our
semester
grade
substantially,
I
was
highly
sensitive
to
the
notion
that
I
was
writing
to
an
unfamiliar
audience.
As
I
begin
my
student
conferences
this
year
in
which
many
freshman
students
will
be
displaying
their
writing
for
the
first
time
at
the
college
level,
I
must
realize
that
they
too
may
be
experiencing
such
feelings
of
anxiety
and
uncertainty.
I
must
remember
that
just
as
this
professor's
reaction
to
my
midterm
essay,
full
of
constructive
criticism
and
of
praise,
guided
my
future
writing
endeavors
in
his
class,
that
my
reactions
as
a
WA
and
as
a
peer
of
these
new
college
students
will
affect
to
some
degree
their
attitudes
toward
writing.
Because
in
my
college
career
I
have
not
been
encouraged
to
express
myself
creatively,
I
found
the
nature
of
the
assignments
in
my
VaST
seminar
to
be
particularly
refreshing
and
rewarding.
The
professor
dissuaded
us
from
writing
essays
in
a
conventional
manner
by
encouraging
us
to
incorporate
the
course
material
in
a
letter
to
Charles
Darwin,
in
a
screen
play
for
NOVA
and
in
a
majority
opinion
for
the
a
U.S.
District
Court.
In
this
course
I
also
had
the
interesting
experience
of
being
on
the
receiving
end
of
the
WA
conference.
Although
other
students
and
even
some
professors
seemed
surprised
that
as
a
WA
I
would
be
expected
to
meet
with
another
WA,
I
found
these
conferences
to
be
beneficial.
In
the
past
two
years,
I
have
found
that
internalizing
and
reacting
to
the
feedback
of
other
students
and
professors
have
improved
the
quality
of
my
writing.
In
fact
I
often
cannot
begin
writing
until
I
have
discussed
the
assignment
with
another
individual,
be
it
a
student
or
a
professor
or
even
one
of
my
parents.
Although
I
fully
appreciate
and
value
the
assistance
of
a
writing
associate,
being
assigned
a
WA
for
a
political
theory
class
this
past
semester
was
particularly
intimidating.
Whereas
all
VaST
professors
collaborate
with
a
writing
associate,
it
is
not
the
norm
for
a
WA
to
be
assigned
to
a
government
course;
that
the
professor
felt
the
need
to
request
a
WA
was
an
indication
to
me
that
the
writing
in
this
course
was
going
to
be
tough!
Throughout
the
spring
semester
I
did
find
that
constructing
a
political
theory
paper
was
one
of
the
most
challenging
tasks
I
have
attempted
in
my
history
as
a
writer.
Writing
such
a
paper-from
forming
an
interesting
introduction
in
which
we
were
to
pose
a
theoretical
question
to
engaging
in
a
discussion
with
the
theorist
to
challenging
his/her
views-
was
a
thoroughly
exhausting
experience.
Although
I
enjoy
assignments
similar
to
those
in
Literary
Questions
that
impose
few
limits
on
me
as
a
writer,
I
would
have
appreciated
more
rigid
guidelines
in
this
course.
Even
though
the
professor
distributed
a
packet
detailing
the
main
points
of
a
political
theory
paper,
I
found
myself
wondering
"is
this
even
a
theoretical
question?"
Although
these
assignments
as
such
challenged
me
to
think
critically
and
to
express
my
viewpoints
concisely,
it
is
not
the
experience
gained
from
the
writing
of
these
papers
that
will
be
most
beneficial
to
my
career
as
a
WA;
rather
it
is
the
insight
I
gained
from
being
the
student
in
the
writing
conference.
During
one
meeting
with
the
WA.,
the
WA
insightfully
highlighted
many
areas
which
needed
improvement.
Yet
she
never
indicated
that
she
found
any
of
my
points
to
be
strong
and
never
mentioned
a
way
in
which
I
could
improve
the
weak
areas.
Highly
sensitive
to
criticism,
I
left
the
conference
with
little
confidence
and
without
any
sense
of
how
to
correct
my
errors.
This
experience
made
me
aware
that
while
it
is
essential
to
point
out
the
writer's
weaknesses
that
it
is
also
necessary
to
comment
upon
the
positive
aspects
of
the
student's
writing.
Mentioning
positives
as
well
as
negatives
not
only
boosts
confidence,
but
also
lends
the
student
some
insight
as
to
how
to
correct
his/her
errors.
Encouraging
writers
to
take
notes
during
the
conferences
and
asking
students
if
they
have
a
sense
of
what
the
next
step
in
the
writing
process
will
be
also
ensure
that
the
student
will
leave
the
conference
with
some
direction.
Fortunately
I
felt
as
though
I,
as
a
WA,
was
adequately
prepared
to
help
students
with
their
writing.
In
my
first
year
as
a
WA
I
was
surprised
by
the
wide
range
of
attitudes
among
the
students
I
met
with
in
conferences.
While
some
students
were
eager
to
schedule
more
than
the
one
required
conference,
others
did
not
show
up
for
their
appointments
or
did
attend
the
meeting,
but
were
clearly
uninterested.
Although
I
did
feel
that
I
had
the
authority
to
help
other
student
writers,
I
was
amazed
that
there
were
a
few
students
who
did
not
have
any
experience
in
combining
the
viewpoints
of
authors
with
their
own
analysis
to
construct
a
meaningful
essay.
Because
I
felt
I
could
give
some
direction
to
one
student
in
particular,
but
that
she
would
need
more
guidance
than
I
could
offer
in
one
half
hour,
I
communicated
this
concern
to
the
professor.
I
also
experienced
some
difficulty
in
conferences
in
which
there
was
a
great
deal
I
felt
I
had
to
cover.
I
felt
uneasy
allowing
things
to
go
unnoticed
or
unsaid,
but
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
often
most
beneficial
to
concentrate
on
a
few
key
points.
Allowing
the
student
to
begin
the
conference
with
questions
or
concerns
gave
me
a
sense
of
which
topics
to
cover.
Often
when
I
would
indicate
an
area
that
needed
some
improvement
the
student
would
immediately
and
naturally
react
by
asking
how
to
remedy
the
situation.
Understanding
that
each
student
will
learn
and
thus
develop
his/her
own
personal
style
as
he/she
corrects
his/her
mistakes.,
I
found
it
beneficial
to
redirect
the
question
to
the
student.
Because
communicating
with
the
professor
is
necessary
in
order
to
understand
his/her
expectations,
I
plan
to
begin
my
academic
year
as
a
writing
associate
by
contacting
the
professor
immediately
and
encouraging
the
professor
to
require
that
the
students
pass
in
a
first
draft
to
him
before
each
conference.
I
also
hope
to
meet
with
the
class
as
a
whole
before
the
first
round
of
conferences.
Having
seen
the
positive
consequences
of
talking
to
other
WAs
and
especially
to
professors
in
my
own
writing
history,
I
will
encourage
each
student
to
communicate
with
other
writers
and
with
their
FYS
professors.
Most
importantly
from
the
transitional
sophomore
year
to
this
third
year
I
bring
the
realization
that
the
reactions
of
others
have
greatly
shaped
my
attitudes
and
my
writing
style
and
therefore
that
my
comments-
both
those
which
are
critical
and
those
which
are
full
of
praise
-
may
potentially
do
the
same.
My
experience
as
a
writer
throughout
the
past
year
in
which
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
able
to
seek
the
advice
of
other
WAs
and
to
work
as
a
WA
has
reaffirmed
the
notion
that
each
student
has
his/her
personal
writing
history.
Being
a
WA
gives
me
the
privilege
and
responsibility
to
help
other
writers
shape
their
own
writing
histories
and
the
opportunity
to
develop
my
own.
