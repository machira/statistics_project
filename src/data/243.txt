Literacy
Narrative:
Writing
Like
a
WA
Christopher
In
the
Pallazzo
Vecchio
in
Florence
Italy,
there
is
a
painting
known
as
the
Apotheosis
of
Cosimo
.
It
is
a
round
painting
that
depicts
Duke
Cosimo
I,
the
first
Grad
Duke
of
Tuscany,
surrounded
by
twenty
one,
shield-bearing
angels
or
putti,
who
represent
the
various
cities
of
Tuscany
that
the
Duke
ruled
over.
The
Duke
looks
calmly
assured,
his
position
assured
by
Divine
Right,
while
the
putti
all
appear
benignly
submissive.
All
in
all,
it
is
a
highly
symbolic
painting,
which
provides
the
illusion
of
a
noble
ruler
at
peace
with
his
land.
Of
course,
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth.
Duke
Cosimo
stabbed,
strangled,
and
poisoned
his
enemies
like
most
despots,
and
the
Tuscan
city-states
were
constantly
scheming
to
get
out
from
under
his
oppressive
control.
You
may
now
ask,
What
does
this
painting
have
to
do
with
writing,
or
being
a
Writing
Associate
???
I
believe
that
we
as
Writing
Associates
have
the
same
dilemma
as
Duke
Cosimo.
We
must
be
able
to
reconcile
our
own
everyday
struggles
as
writers,
with
others'
illusions
of
what
a
Writing
Associate
is.
One
of
the
central
tenets
of
the
Writing
Program
is
that,"...
you
are
an
associate
to
the
group
of
students
and
to
the
professor
assigned
to
you.
Associate
carries
with
it
the
sense
of
equality
and
cooperation
upon
which
the
program
is
founded
...
(WA
Handbook,
2-3)."
While
cooperation
is
more
easily
recognized
and
attained
in
conferences,
equality
remains
an
inconsistent
concept.
Even
though
I
was
assigned
to
an
upper
level
class,
filled
mostly
by
juniors
and
seniors
who
had
worked
with
a
WA
before,
I
still
felt
a
heavy
burden
to
carry
the
discussion
throughout
the
conference.
I
consistently
tried
to
engage
them
with
questions
about
the
content
and
construction
of
their
papers,
to
varying
degrees
of
success.
In
perhaps
the
most
memorable
exchange,
a
girl
turned
to
me
and
said,
Why
are
you
asking
ME
questions
???
I
really
need
answers
!
While
this
was
an
extreme
moment
(and
an
unsuccessful
conference),
it
does
show
how
we
as
WA's
are
perceived
to
have
answers
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
writing
process
rarely
provides
simple
answers.
Finally,
had
this
girl
been
able
to
see
into
my
future,
she
might
not
have
said
what
she
did.
Two
months
later
I
was
working
on
a
final
paper
for
an
English
class.
It
was
to
be
a
minimum
of
fifteen
pages,
and
would
account
for
half
my
grade.
Perhaps
more
daunting,
was
that
the
paper
really
had
to
include
the
insight
that
I
had
gained
from
the
course.
I
spent
hours
in
the
library
researching,
reading
articles,
and
outlining
my
arguments.
I
spent
more
time
preparing
this
paper
than
any
other
I
had
throughout
my
college
career.
However,
when
it
came
time
to
actually
write
the
paper,
I
was
at
a
loss.
It
was
a
strange
feeling.
In
the
past,
I
had
joked
about
having
writer's
block
,
but
this
time
I
actually
had
it.
As
the
due
date
approached,
I
became
more
and
more
nervous.
There
were
times
where
I
spent
three
or
four
hours
writing
and
rewriting
the
same
paragraph.
The
due
date
came
and
I
was
finally
forced
myself
to
sit
down
and
finish,
if
only
to
keep
from
failing
on
the
paper
because
it
would
be
late.
When
I
had
finished
(two
days
after
it
was
due),
I
simply
turned
it
in
without
even
proof
reading
it
At
that
point
I
had
become
so
frustrated
with
myself,
that
I
didn't
want
to
deal
with
the
paper
any
longer.
I
couldn't
understand
how
I
had
been
so
disabled
as
a
writer.
Looking
back
now,
I
realize
that
my
own
best
intentions
had
sabotaged
me.
While
I
was
right
in
throughly
researching
the
problem,
I
spent
to
much
time
thinking
about
how
to
write
the
paper
as
opposed
to
actually
writing.
By
the
time
that
I
sat
down
to
write,
I
had
mentally
finished
the
paper,
which
made
the
actual
writing
aspects
seem
like
drudge
work.
Another
obstacle
was
that
I
did
not
allow
myself
to
be
wrong.
Throughout
the
writing
process,
I
would
spend
large
amounts
of
time
writing
and
then
rewriting
the
same
sentence,
in
order
to
make
it
right
.
Instead
of
letting
one
idea
flow
into
another,
this
constant
editing
choked
off
the
flow
of
both
my
writing
and
my
thoughts.
I
do
not
think
it
was
coincidence
either
that
these
troubles
appeared
as
I
was
reading
my
last
set
of
papers
for
the
semester.
The
problems
which
had
affected
me
were
in
no
small
way
linked
to
being
a
Writing
Associate.
The
amount
of
preparation
that
I
had
assiduously
done
was
what
we
hope
all
writers
would
do,
while
my
attention
(some
might
say
over
attention)
to
sentence
structure
was
all
that
one
would
expect
from
someone
who
was
trained
to
look
for
errors.
So
why
did
my
efforts
prove
to
be
so
ineffective
?
I
believe
it
was
because
I
was
being
too
much
of
a
WA.
My
desire
for
control
led
me
to
over
emphasize
the
positive
writing
traits
which
I
had
espoused
to
people
in
my
conferences.
My
over
compensation
was
antithetical
to
the
way
1
write,
and
ended
u{j
stifling
myself
in
the
process.
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
research
and
editing
aren't
important
to
the
writing
process.
Four
months
after
the
afore
mentioned
paper,
I
found
myself
writing
a
paper
in
which
I
faced
the
opposite
problem.
I
was
studying
abroad
in
Italy,
and
had
been
nominated
for
a
prize
which
required
me
to
write
a
two
page
essay
detailing
an
experience
which
had
affected
me
during
my
stay
in
Italy.
With
no
further
instructions,
I
sat
down
the
night
before
and
wrote,
what
I
thought
to
be
a
good
essay
about
how
my
host
mother
being
pregnant
with
her
first
child
affected
my
presence
in
the
family.
In
contrast
with
the
other
paper,
this
essay
was
a
dream.
I
finished
it
on
time
and
left
fro
the
weekend.
When
I
returned
on
Monday
morning
and
saw
that
my
name
was
not
on
the
list
of
winners,
I
was
very
disappointed.
First
off,
I
didn't
get
to
go
on
the
culinary
tour
of
the
Tuscan
countryside.
Aside
from
this
hunger
induced
woe,
I
thought
I
had
written
a
really
good
essay.
I
waited
a
couple
of
days
until
I
could
get
my
essay
back,
at
which
point
I
received
a
shock.
What
I
originally
thought
was
a
great
essay,
turned
out
be
terrible
(or
at
least
not
that
good)
upon
my
rereading
of
it.
It
was
mostly
sacchrin
coated
emotion
worthy
of
inclusion
in
Chicken
Soup
for
the
Crappy
Writer's
Soul."
Why
had
the
paper
turned
out
so
poorly
?
I
think
it
was
due
to
the
fact
that
I
failed
to
fully
think
out
what
I
had
written.
I
realized
that
I
had
failed
to
deal
with
some
of
the
more
interesting
details
of
life
in
my
household,
choosing
instead
to
talk
only
of
the
generalities.
I
now
understand
that
those
people
who
read
my
paper
weren't
moved
to
select
me,
because
I
had
failed
to
communicate
any
of
the
experience
that
was
MINE.
Instead
they
got
a
picture
of
anybody's
host
family.
In
many
ways,
this
paper
failed
for
the
exact
opposite
reasons
that
the
first
one
did.
Instead
of
refining
my
ideas,
I
trusted
my
first
instinct
and
thought
that
its
originality
would
carry
the
paper.
Furthermore,
the
sentences
that
I
written
so
easily
could
have
used
some
of
the
corrections
that
I
spent
hours
on
in
the
first
paper.
In
the
end
my
essay
was
a
victim
of
a
certain
amount
of
hubris,
in
that
I
believed
that
I
could
no
wrong,
despite
all
that
I
had
learned
from
reading
other
students'
papers.
So
where
does
this
leave
me,
the
girl,
and
of
course
Duke
Cosimo
?
From
my
narrative,
I
hope
that
I
have
made
clear
that
you
will
not
see
my
head
surrounded
by
cherubs
anywhere
inside
Pardee
319.
By
no
means
are
all
of
my
papers
as
difficult
for
me
as
these
two.
I
chose
them
because
I
felt
they
were
at
the
extremes
of
what
I
as
a
writer
and
WA
delt
with
in
the
last
year.
As
I
stated
before,
the
problems
which
I
had
with
the
first
problem
were
closely
related
to
being
a
WA.
It
was
no
coincidence
that
in
dealing
with
some
students
who
had
not
fully
developed
their
arguments,
or
had
used
awkward
sentence
construction,
I
ended
up
focusing
on
the
same
problems
in
my
own
work.
Likewise,
the
paper
I
wrote
in
Italy
was
a
product
of
being
in
an
environment
in
which
writing
wasn't
a
weekly
experience.
By
being
away
I
had
apparently
become
a
lapsed
proof
reader.
These
two
episodes
have
taught
me
that
I
must
be
far
more
aware
of
what
is
influencing
me
as
a
writer.
I
had
always
considered
each
paper
to
be
a
lesson,
and
that
as
I
wrote
I
gradually
gained
insight
into
the
writing
process.
While
this
incremental
model
is
partly
true,
I
neglected
to
consider
how
my
environment
could
affect
my
writing.
I
now
realize
that
writing
is
not
an
act
that
occurs
inside
a
bubble,
but
rather
something
like
galaxy
in
which
various
bodies
(bodies
of
knowledge
in
this
case)
exert
a
certain
pull
upon
each
other,
which
in
turn
makes
the
whole
system
go
round.
This
concept
means,
that
we
as
writers
must
be
aware
not
only
of
the
large
objects
in
our
universe,
such
as
organization
or
style,
but
we
must
also
be
able
to
feel
the
more
subtle
gravity
exerted
by
things
such
as
our
environment,
or
our
own
expectations.
It
is
this
awareness
that
may
be
the
essence
of
what
it
means
to
write
like
a
WA."
As
Writing
Associates,
we
are
more
exposed
to
the
writing
systems
of
our
peers.
This
exposure
can
lend
us
a
better
insight
to
the
dynamics
of
our
own
writing
and
ultimately
make
us
more
aware
of
our
selves
as
writers.
This
awareness
not
only
is
important
to
me,
but
also
to
the
girl
who
bluntly
asked
me
for
the
answer
.
Now
this
question
seems
to
me
to
be
the
product
of
someone
who
believed
the
writing
process
to
be
an
isolated
act
unto
itself.
I
now
wish
that
I
had
more
time
to
talk
to
her
about
the
various
things
that
led
her
to
believe
that
there
was
that
one
way
to
write
her
paper.
Perhaps
if
she
was
more
aware
of
that,
she
might
have
had
an
easier
time
polishing
the
paper.
Thus
as
WA's
we
should
not
only
seek
to
improve
the
paper,
but
the
writer
as
well.
Through
our
own
discoveries
of
what
affects
our
writing,
we
can
provide
knowledge
to
the
students
we
work
with,
and
hopefully
allow
them
to
gain
insight
into
what
causes
them
to
write
as
they
do.
This
can
provide
for
an
even
richer
exchange
between
WA
and
WAee,
and
ultimately
create
a
dialogue
between
associates
.
Having
said
all
this
I
hope
that
we
can
all
see
Duke
Cosimo
for
the
fraud
that
he
is.
As
much
we
or
the
people
we
work
with
want
to
believe
that
our
head
belongs
up
among
the
clouds
with
hundreds
of
little
writer
angels
surrounding
us,
it
simply
can
not
be.
We
are
people
trying
to
manage
the
complex
process
of
writing.
Within
that
process
there
are
many
things
which
can
both
help
us
and
lead
us
astray.
If
we
hope
to
be
anything
close
to
this
glorious
image
we
must
constantly
be
aware
of
what
we
are
doing,
while
doing
the
utmost
to
debunk
the
myth
that
we
are
somehow
different
from
other
writers
around
us.
In
the
end,
the
only
time
at
which
this
image
is
believable
is,
of
course,
when
you
like
Cosimo
are
dead.
Until
that
point
in
time,
it
is
all
just
propaganda.
