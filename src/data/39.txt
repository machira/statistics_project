Hittinq

Bookshelves
Most
individuals,
regardless
of
their
level
of
sentimentality,
have
a
propensity
to
save
their
writing.
Rereading
old
manuscripts
can
be
both
entertaining
and
enlightening,
Previous
writing
samples
are
memoirs
of
prior
stages
in
one's
life.
However,
it
is
rare
that
one
examines
his/her
previous
writing
to
find
its
place
within
the
context
of
the
development
one's
own
writing
skills.
For
this
literacy
narrative,
I
have
returned
to
my
bookshelf
to
find
a
comprehensive
sampling
of
my
writing
from
its
outset
to
the
present
day.
Most
of
the
writing
I
do
today
is
structured,
analytical,
and
concise
exposition.
In
fact,
I
find
the
notion
of
creative
writing
rather
frightening.
When
writing
exposition,
I
know
that
if
I
conform
to
the
basic
structure
that
I
have
learned
through
the
years,
I
am
sure
to
produce,
at
the
very
least,
a
decent
paper.
However,
I
never
learned
the
rules
of
creative
writing-
if
there
are
any
rules
to
creative
writing
My
ignorance
of
these
rules,
or
worse,
the
notion
that
there
are
no
rules,
inhibits
me
from
writing
outside
of
the
institution
.
All
of
my
early
writing
was
actually
of
a
creative
style.
At
North
Stratfield
School,
my
grammar
school,
I
wrote
comics
for
the
school
papers
the
NSS
Press.
It
was
also
around
this
time
that
I
wrote
my
first
novel
-
a
three
page
story
about
a
pet
monster-
written,
illustrated,
and
even
bound
by
yours
truly.
During
grammar
school
we
were
often
asked
to
write
about
ourselves
or
our
families.
Even
then
I
attempted
to
add
a
creative
or
comical
edge
to
each
piece.
One
such
piece,
the
story
of
Howard
E.
Cockroach,
described
my
brother,
Howard
E.
Rubin,
through
the
life
of
a
cockroach
(Believe
it
or
not,
I
am
really
rather
fond
of
my
brother).
In
sixth
grade
I
had
my
first
actual
writing
class.
In
this
class
I
was
given
the
option
to
write
about
any
topic
I
chose.
The
most
important
aspect
of
the
class
was
learning
the
steps
of
writing-
brainstorming,
writing,
peer
conferencing,
rewriting,
and
proof
readings
therefore,
the
subject
matter
was
of
little
importance
to
the
teacher.
During
this
time,
I
found
I
was
most
comfortable
writing
about
experiences
I
have
had
or
people
I
have
known.
After
writing
several
narratives,
I
decided
I
had
enough
experience
to
write
an
actual
book,
a
fictional
story
with
a
fully
developed
plot
and
a
whole
slew
of
characters.
The
book
was
a
story
of
a
boy
who
becomes
a
character
in
a
book
he's
reading
about
a
boy
who
becomes
a
character
in
a
book
he
is
reading.
After
a
while
I
couldn't
follow
my
own
plot
and
gave
up
on
the
story.
Perhaps
if
I
was
encouraged
to
stick
with
that
story
and
work
out
the
bugs
,
my
writing
today
would
be
very
different.
(At
least
this
essay
would
be
different.)
After
my
failure
with
my
first
book,
I
returned
to
writing
narratives
of
my
experiences.
The
really
exciting
ones
had
two
or
three
stories
written
about
them,
each
one
with
a
different
edge.
I
began
to
enjoy
writing
about
these
experiences,
as
I
learned
how
to
use
tone
and
mood
in
my
writing
to
make
situations
seem
more
dramatic,
or
traumatic,
than
they
had
actually
been.
In
eighth
grade,
my
English
class
was
assigned
to
compose
daily
journal
entries.
Possible
journal
topics
ranged
from
poetry
to
free
writing,
role
playing,
and
book
reports,
This
journal
was
the
first
time
that
I
used
written
communication
to
express
my
thoughts
and
feelings,
The
ability
to
create
dramatic
settings
that
I
acquired
in
my
previous
writing
enhanced
my
journal
entries.
My
teacher
often
made
comments
in
this
journal
that
she
could
envision
her
self
in
my
writing.
The
beginning
of
high
school
marked
the
end
of
the
me
centered
writing
of
my
earlier
years,
as
well
as
the
death
of
any
creativity
my
writing
may
have
possessed.
In
ninth
grade
I
had
my
first
experience
with
thesis
style
writing,
When
I
handed
the
rough
draft
of
my
Romeo
and
Juliet
paper
to
the
teacher,
she
asked
me
Where's
your
thesis?
.
I
responded
with
the
question,
What's
a
thesis?
.
Although
I
was
taught
what
a
thesis
is
in
ninth
grade,
it
wasn't
until
tenth
grade
that
I
learned
how
to
use
writing
to
make
a
point.
My
sophomore
year
English
teacher,
Mr.
Billette,
introduced
our
class
to
the
famous
Chicken
Foot
style
of
writing.
He
promised
us
that
the
Chicken
Foot
would
be
our
friend
for
life,
and
that
we
would
take
it
with
us
everywhere
we
went.
Mr,
Gillette
taught
us
that,
like
the
chicken's
foot,
all
writing
required
a
strong
leg
(the
main
idea),
backed
up
by
toes
(the
supporting
ideas).
Each
toe
must
otter
equal
support
in
order
to
maintain
balance.
To
this
day,
I
still
make
my
papers
conform
to
the
Chicken
Foot-
sometimes
I
even
draw
the
foot.
I
believe
that
all
my
writing
from
that
point
on
has
been
tuning
and
now
fine
tuning
that
style.
My
junior
year
English
course
emphasized
elements
of
expository
writing,
with
paper
topics
such
as
cause
and
effect
or
development
by
example.
My
teacher
felt
that
my
writing
had
nice
tight
structure,
complex
but
smooth
reading
content
and
was
thoughtfully
arranged
.
That
year
and
the
following
year
I
grew
increasingly
confident
about
my
writing.
I
received
extensive
praise
and
very
little
criticism
(although,
looking
back
on
that
writing
now,
I
certainly
could
have
used
more).
When
the
topics
were
simple,
I
had
very
little
trouble
organizing
them
into
near
perfect
structure.
However,
in
college,
when
topics
became
more
complex
and
in-depth,
I
found
that
my
writing
grew
less
and
less
organized.
My
rough
draft
of
my
first
FYS
paper
was
returned
to
me
stating
that
I
needed
to
work
on
my
organization.
Chicken
Foot
and
my
nice
tight
organization
flew
out
the
window
when
papers
exceeded
eight
pages.
With
the
help
of
my
WA,
I
was
able
to
take
the
ideas
in
my
paper
and
group
them
in
a
way
that
gave
my
paper
structure:
tremendous
structure.
I
used
subheadings
in
that
first
paper,
as
well
as
in
several
other
major
papers
that
year.
I
have
since
found
that
while
subheadings
may
be
appropriate
for
my
scientific
writing
courses,
such
as
Biology
and
Psychology,
such
structure
may
be
a
bit
excessive
for
other
forms
of
writing.
However,
the
extensive
structure
I
employed
helped
me
concentrate
and
develop
techniques
to
organize
details
in
longer
papers.
My
most
recent
challenge
is
working
on
transitions
between
ideas
instead
of
the
using
abrasive
subheadings.
Examining
my
writing
history
has
helped
me
understand
why
I
write
what
I
do
and
how
I
do
it.
Basically,
my
education
has
taught
me
to
love
structure.
In
the
early
days
of
my
instruction,
when
writing
was
free
of
criticism,
and
I
was
free
of
inhibitions,
creative
writing
was
fun
and,
more
importantly,
risk
free.
However,
as
I
got
older
and
became
more
critical
of
my
work,
writing
creatively
lost
its
rewards.
Unlike
creative
writing,
I
received
extensive
instruction
in
expository
writing.
Throughout
high
school
and
college
I
was
commended
on
my
concise
writing
and
organization.
After
a
time
these
became,
to
me,
the
most
important
elements
of
a
paper
Each
individual
develops
his/her
own
writing
skills
and
style.
However,
I
feel
that
the
development
of
these
skills
is
a
collective
effort.
An
individual
is
influenced
by
the
extent
of
support
that
he/she
receives
during
certain
critical
stages
during
the
development
of
his/her
writing,
For
example,
if
during
sixth
grade,
when
my
writing
development
was
at
a
critical
stage,
I
had
received
more
guidance,
perhaps
I
would
be
more
interested
in
writing
creatively
today.
In
a
similar
manner,
if
I
had
not
received
guidance
during
my
First
Year
Seminar,
I
may
never
have
developed
the
necessary
skills
or
confidence
that
are
an
integral
part
of
academic
writing.
