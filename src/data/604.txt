Literacy
Narrative
August
21,
2009
I
wish
that
I
could
start
my
literacy
narrative
with
an
interesting
or
funny
little
anecdote
about
my
childhood
experiences,
but
I
cannot
because
the
fact
is
that
I
do
not
remember
a
particular
experience
that
has
significantly
impacted
or
has
characterized
my
growth
into
a
literate
person.
When
I
try
to
remember
my
early
writing
and
reading
experiences,
a
swirl
of
disconnected
blurry
memories
pops
into
my
head,
and
at
face
value,
none
of
them
really
tell
me
anything
about
how
my
literacy
has
developed.
In
a
way,
I
am
attempting
to
give
meaning
to
these
fragmented
memories
by
arranging
and
analyzing
them
in
this
narrative.
In
the
book
Literacy:
An
Introduction
to
the
Ecology
of
Written
Language,
David
Barton
states
that
rliteracy
is
located
in
interactions
between
peopleiTherefore,
to
understand
literacy,
researchers
need
to
observe
literacy
events
as
they
happen
in
peopleus
lives,
in
particular
times
and
placess
(52).
In
this
chapter,
I
have
tried
to
follow
Bartonus
advice,
and
as
my
own
literacy
researcher,
I
have
attempted
to
make
sense
of
my
early
literacy
development
by
analyzing
the
literacy
practices
that
I
engaged
in
at
home
and
in
elementary
school.
The
earliest
writing
experience
I
have
had
that
I
can
remember
was
a
penmanship
class
that
I
took
in
the
second
grade.
Everyday,
Mrs.
Klein
would
give
pencils
to
all
of
the
boys
and
girls
and
would
guide
them
through
several
writing
exercises
in
the
classu
penmanship
book.
The
exercises
required
students
to
copy
sentences
in
script
from
their
penmanship
books
into
marble
notebooks.
At
the
end
of
every
class,
Mrs.
Klein
would
personally
select
the
penmanship
sample
of
the
student
that
she
believed
had
best
completed
the
exercises
and
would
display
it
at
the
front
of
the
room.
I
remember
Mrs.
Klein
admiring
the
neat
and
flowing
penmanship
samples:
the
pronounced
loops
of
the
cursive
letters
and
the
slight
rightward
slant
of
the
script
handwriting.
I
remember
feeling
frustrated
every
class
because
my
letters
never
had
any
loops
and
because
I
did
not
know
how
to
write
on
a
slant.
The
loops
I
made
were
more
like
schizophrenic
squiggles,
and
due
to
my
left-handedness,
I
would
smudge
all
of
the
words
at
the
beginning
of
every
line.
One
thing
I
learned
from
penmanship
class
was
that
writing
with
pencils
was
a
messy
business.
Everyday,
I
would
go
home
with
black
lead
coating
the
entire
side
of
my
left
hand.
Looking
back,
I
think
that
I
now
understand
why
so
much
emphasis
was
placed
on
handwriting
in
second
grade.
My
classmates
and
I
were
just
beginning
to
learn
to
write,
and
the
purpose
of
penmanship
class
was
to
encourage
students
to
write
legibly.
By
writing
neatly,
we
could
engage
in
handwritten
literacy
practicesialetter
writing,
note
making,
etc.iaand
our
writing
would
be
readable
not
only
by
ourselves
but
also
by
other
people.
These
intercommunicative
writing
practices
are
discussed
by
Dennis
Baron
in
his
essay
rFrom
Pencils
to
Pixels:
The
Stages
of
Literacy
Technologiess
in
which
he
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
writing
rallows
us
to
communicate
in
ways
that
speech
does
nots
and
that
it
rpermits
new
ways
of
bridging
time
and
spaces
(75).
While
this
might
be
true,
I
have
to
question
whether
or
not
good
penmanship
is
still
relevant
to
my
literacy.
As
Baron
acknowledges,
rwriting
itself
is
first
and
foremost
a
technologys
and
as
a
new
writing
technology
develops,
we
radapt
our
lives
to
its
(71).
Computerized
forms
of
communication
now
dominate
my
literacy
practices,
and
I
rarely
handwrite
anything
to
communicate.
When
I
use
Facebook
or
when
I
write
an
email,
I
am
not
relying
on
my
handwriting
to
express
my
words;
rather,
my
words
are
expressed
in
the
form
of
a
standardized
and
universally
readable
font.
It
seems
to
me,
then,
that
as
the
computer
plays
a
larger
role
in
my
communicative
writing
practices,
the
value
and
relevance
of
my
penmanship
continues
to
diminish.
The
penmanship
class
that
I
took
in
Second
grade
seemed
to
presuppose
that
handwritten
forms
of
communication
would
continue
to
prevail
in
society
and
that
rgoods
penmanship
would
be
necessary,
therefore,
to
developing
an
intercommunicative
literacy.
The
class
did
not
anticipate
that
computers
would
change
peopleus
written
forms
of
communication,
which
would
cease
to
rely
on
rgoods
handwriting.
I
was
relieved
when
I
entered
fifth
grade.
Pencils
were
replaced
by
erasable
pens,
and
the
ink
was
much
easier
to
wash
off
than
the
lead.
Fifth
grade
was
also
a
memorable
year
because
it
was
the
first
time
that
I
was
introduced
to
writing
book
reports.
Up
until
that
point,
I
had
never
written
any
papers,
so
analyzing
novels
and
writing
about
characters
and
plot
lines
was
a
new
experience
for
me.
I
remember
that
every
month
Mrs.
Weisman,
my
English
teacher,
would
assign
the
class
a
book
report.
The
first
report
that
I
wrote
was
based
on
Robert
Lewis
Stevensonus
novel
Treasure
Island.
I
remember
that
I
had
a
lot
of
fun
writing
the
paper
and
describing
the
vicious
pirates
and
their
quest
for
buried
gold.
I
no
longer
remember
any
significant
details
of
the
book
itself
or
of
the
report
that
I
wrote.
I
do,
however,
remember
that
I
received
an
A
on
the
paper.
I
think
that
this
paper
writing
experience
has
stuck
out
in
my
mind
because
it
was
the
first
time
that
my
writing
took
on
an
organized
form.
To
answer
the
book
report
questions,
I
had
to
organize
my
ideas
in
order
to
describe
why
I
liked
and
empathized
with
certain
characters
and
why
I
thought
certain
parts
of
the
novels
were
important
or
exciting.
In
third
and
fourth
grade,
the
focus
of
English
classes
was
phonics
and
grammar.
In
fifth
grade,
I
learned
to
apply
my
phonics
and
grammar
skills
in
order
to
write
statements
and
to
organize
my
ideas
in
a
loosely
coherent
form.
Following
grammatical
rules
ceased
to
be
an
end
in
itself.
Rather,
I
had
to
use
my
grammar
as
a
means
of
expressing
my
own
opinions.
The
next
writing
challenge
I
faced
was
much
more
difficult
to
overcome
than
the
two-page
book
reports
of
fifth
grade.
With
only
three
months
of
school
left
until
summer
break,
Mrs.
Weisman
socked
the
eighth
grade
honors
English
class
with
a
whopping
five-page
research
paper
assignment.
The
class
was
instructed
to
pick
an
author,
to
read
at
least
three
books
by
the
author,
and
to
write
a
research
paper
identifying
recurrent
themes
throughout
the
writerus
works.
I
picked
J.R.R
Tolkein
as
my
author
because
I
had
already
read
The
Hobbit
and
The
Lord
of
the
Rings
trilogy.
I
had
really
enjoyed
reading
the
books,
and
I
decided
that
I
wanted
to
learn
more
about
Tolkien
as
a
writer.
I
remember
going
to
the
library
and
photocopying
dozens
of
pages
out
of
English
literature
survey
books.
I
rented
a
few
Tolkien
biographies
and
began
sifting
through
my
research
materials
to
find
a
topic
of
interest.
Finally,
I
decided
to
write
my
paper
on
the
impacts
of
Tolkienus
World
War
I
experiences
on
his
fiction.
I
discovered
that
J.R.R.
Tolkein,
as
a
soldier,
was
traumatized
by
the
destruction
of
the
war
and
that
he
incorporated
strong
anti-war
messages
is
his
The
Lord
of
the
Rings
trilogy.
I
believe
that
writing
the
research
paper
caused
me
to
become
a
more
serious
reader.
Prior
to
the
research
assignment,
I
did
not
think
that
novels
and
short
stories
had
any
sort
of
relevance
to
real
world
events,
and
I
never
considered
that
works
of
fiction
could
be
looked
at
as
products
of
particular
historical
circumstances.
In
writing
the
paper
about
the
Lord
of
the
Rings
trilogy,
I
spent
just
as
much
time
researching
World
War
I
as
I
did
researching
Tolkein.
In
doing
so,
I
learned
how
World
War
I
devastated
continental
Europe,
and
how
J.R.R.
Tolkein
translated
his
war
experiences
into
his
novels.
I
think
this
literacy
experience
caused
me
to
learn
that
authors
do
not
write
novels
just
to
entertain
audiences;
rather,
they
write
with
a
purpose
in
mind
that
is
manifested
by
themes
in
the
fiction
itself.
In
addition,
I
began
to
appreciate
the
connection
between
works
of
fiction
and
the
historical
circumstances
in
which
they
were
written.
In
discovering
how
Tolkein
loathed
nationalistic
values
and
industrialized
warfare,
I
understood
that
works
of
fiction
could
challenge
societal
views
and
could
criticize
world
events.
As
Barton
states,
texts
have
the
power
to
mediate,
or
rto
bring
two
things
closeriby
means
of
a
mediums
(84).
In
understanding
Tolkeinus
anti-war
messages
in
the
trilogy,
I
saw
the
Lord
of
the
Rings
in
a
way
that
mediated
my
understanding
of
World
War
I.
In
the
case
of
the
eighth
grade
paper,
I
realized
that
the
anti-war
themes
of
the
trilogy
were
criticisms
of
World
War
I
as
an
unnecessary
and
unjust
conflict.
In
this
way,
I
came
to
see
reading
the
trilogy
as
a
means
of
my
developing
a
deeper
understanding
of
history.
The
texts
themselves
served
as
mediums
that
brought
my
understanding
of
the
fiction
itself
closer
to
an
understanding
of
the
historical
circumstances
of
the
First
World
War.
In
making
these
connections,
I
think
that
I
reshaped
my
view
of
reading,
as
a
literacy
practice.
I
could
no
longer
expect
to
appreciate
fiction
simply
by
understanding
booksu
plots
and
characters.
I
had
to
focus
on
understanding
how
themes
in
the
fiction
related
to
the
world
around
me
and
how
they
had
the
power
to
shape
and
to
impact
my
own
views
of
different
issues.
Later
on
in
high
school,
I
paid
attention
to
the
fiction
I
read,
trying
to
understand
how
the
messages
in
the
texts
were
relevant
to
the
real
world.
Understanding
texts
in
this
way
helped
me
to
do
well
in
most
of
my
high
school
English
classes.
From
freshman
until
senior
year,
I
spent
almost
all
of
my
time
in
my
English
classes
writing
expository
essays.
During
freshman
year,
the
writing
assignments
were
relatively
easy,
and
usually,
they
consisted
of
general,
open-ended
questions,
such
as
rWhat
does
this
mean
in
the
context
of
the
poem.
Use
evidence
to
support
your
claims.s
During
sophomore
year,
the
questions
became
more
difficult
and
specific.
By
far,
however,
I
had
the
most
difficulty
in
my
junior
year
AP
English
class.
The
teacher,
Mr.
Shust,
was
a
follower
of
New
Criticism,
and
he
was
very
intolerant
of
opinions
that
differed
from
his
own
ideas.
In
the
book
Texts
and
Contexts:
Writing
About
Literature
with
Critical
Theory,
Steven
Lynn
discusses
the
purposes
and
strategies
of
New
Criticism
in
analyzing
literary
works.
The
purpose
of
New
Criticism,
according
to
Lynn,
is
to
evaluate
literature
independently
of
authorship
and
of
the
historical
circumstances
in
which
the
works
were
produced.
The
underlying
assumption
of
New
Criticism
is
that
rin
a
unified
work,
every
element
works
together
toward
a
theme,s
and
the
elements
of
the
work
are
treated
individually
to
determine
how
they
contribute
towards
the
whole
thematic
effect
that
the
piece
elicits
(Lynn
14).
Mr.
Shust
had
very
specific
opinions
about
which
themes
were
inherent
in
the
course
readings,
and
I
had
to
conform
to
his
view
of
the
course
readings
in
order
to
do
well
on
the
writing
assignments.
In
a
way,
I
felt
that
each
of
the
assignments
was
like
a
guessing
game.
I
would
say
to
myself
midway
through
a
paper,
rGod,
I
hope
Ium
writing
about
the
right
theme
here.s
If
a
student
made
mistake
and,
God
forbid,
formed
a
valid
and
cogent
argument
that
contradicted
Mr.
Shustus
opinions,
the
student
would
fail
the
assignment.
A
lot
of
students
had
a
lot
of
Fus
that
year,
and
I
was
one
of
them.
The
one
paper
that
I
did
enjoy
writing
in
my
junior
year
English
class
was
a
research
paper
on
the
plays
of
Samuel
Beckett.
Fortunately,
Mr.
Shust
was
not
really
familiar
with
Beckettus
works,
so
I
had
some
leeway
to
pursue
my
own
research
question.
I
received
an
A-
on
the
paper,
but,
in
retrospect,
I
think
the
only
reason
I
received
a
good
grade
on
the
assignment
was
because
Mr.
Shust
had
no
idea
what
the
hell
I
was
talking
about.
Junior
year
English
class
was
definitely
my
worst
academic
experience
because
of
the
strict
classroom
hierarchy
that
was
established
by
Mr.
Shust.
Instead
of
allowing
students
to
freely
discuss
their
ideas,
Mr.
Shust
posited
himself
as
the
dictator
of
the
classroom,
as
well
as
the
judge
and
jury
of
all
that
was
true
and
false.
In
this
way,
Mr.
Shustus
classroom
was
defined
by
the
power
that
he
exerted
over
his
students,
and
the
power
relationship
between
the
teacher
and
the
student
was
characterized
by
intellectual
oppression
because
in
order
to
succeed
in
the
class,
one
had
to
adopt
the
same
literary
attitudes
and
opinions
of
the
teacher.
In
Pedagogy
of
the
Oppressed,
Paulo
Freire
analyzes
oppressive
pedagogical
methods
and
how
oppressive
teachers
tend
to
believe
in,
what
he
has
termed,
the
rbanking
concept
of
educations
(Freire
72).
According
to
this
view,
information
is
deposited
into
students,
who
are
treated
as
rreceptacless
that
need
to
be
filled
with
knowledge
in
the
form
of
facts
(Freire
72).
The
banking
concept
undermines
studentsu
development
of
critical
thinking
skills
because
it
teaches
students
that
the
world
is
a
rstatic
reality,s
which
is
unchangeable
and
which
is
only
knowable
by
acquiring
more
and
more
facts
(73,
83).
Consequently,
students
are
encouraged
to
be
passive
observers
during
their
teachersu
lectures
and
to
accept,
without
refutation,
all
of
the
facts
being
deposited
in
them.
In
this
way,
Richard
Shust
is
a
prime
example
of
an
oppressive
teacher.
When
he
would
read
a
sonnet
to
the
class,
Mr.
Shust
would
guide
us
in
discovering
the
inherent
theme
that
he
believed
was
expressed
by
the
poem,
and
we
were
then
encouraged
to
regard
the
theme
as
a
matter
of
fact,
or
a
truth.
For
example,
if
Mr.
Shust
believed
that
a
Shakespearean
sonnet
expressed
the
theme
rtrue
love
is
immutable,s
we
would
have
to
memorize
the
theme
as
a
fact
about
love
itself.
When
it
came
time
to
take
a
test
or
to
write
a
paper,
we
would
simply
regurgitate
what
we
had
learned
in
order
to
do
well.
In
this
way,
students
were
not
encouraged
to
evaluate
or
to
challenge
any
of
the
course
readings
or
themes.
If
anything,
we
were
forced
to
adopt
Mr.
Shustus
restrictive
views
of
literature
and
of
the
world
in
order
to
succeed
in
the
class.
We
were
taught
and
conditioned
to
believe
that
our
personal
experiences
were
supposed
to
have
no
bearing
on
how
we
read
and
regarded
literature.
In
a
way,
I
think
that
Mr.
Shust,
like
my
mom,
could
be
regarded
as
a
rliteracy
sponsors
because
he
stood
to
benefit
from
exposing
me
to
and
teaching
me
about
literature.
Freire
states
that
the
Banking
Concept
of
Education
ris
well
suited
to
the
purposes
of
the
oppressors,
whose
tranquility
rests
on
how
well
people
fit
the
world
the
oppressors
have
created,
and
how
little
they
question
its
(76).
As
a
pedagogical
oppressor,
Mr.
Shust
was
able
to
reaffirm
his
static
understanding
of
literature
and
of
the
world
by
forcing
my
class
to
conform
to
the
views
and
to
the
beliefs
that
he
himself
held.
In
objectifying
us
as
receptacles
of
information,
Mr.
Shust
was
able
to
stifle
our
challenges
to
his
beliefs,
and
in
doing
so,
he
was
able
to
maintain
his
position
of
authority
over
us.
In
this
way,
Mr.
Shust
was
a
rliteracy
sponsors
because
he
indirectly
benefited,
as
a
pedagogical
oppressor,
from
teaching
us,
and
in
forcing
us
to
accept
his
own
rideological
freight,s
Mr.
Shust
was
able
to
maintain
his
own
static
world
view
(Brandt
557).
To
an
extent,
I
think
that
the
view
of
literature
that
I
had
adopted
in
eighth
grade
was
negated,
or
at
least
undermined,
by
my
experiences
in
my
junior
year
English
class.
In
eighth
grade,
I
was
beginning
to
understand
that
literature
had
the
power
to
impact
both
me,
as
a
reader,
and
the
world
around
me
by
challenging
societal
norms
and
attitudes.
For
instance,
when
I
did
the
research
paper
on
Tolkein
and
learned
about
the
destruction
caused
by
World
War
I,
I
could
understand
why
Tolkein
despised
nationalism
and
why
he
included
anti-war
themes
in
the
Rings
Trilogy.
In
addition,
as
a
reader,
I
agreed
with
his
sentiments
and
adopted
them
as
my
own.
In
this
way,
there
was
a
sort
of
intimate
relationship
between
my
personal
beliefs
and
the
fiction
I
was
reading
because
I
was
making
personal
decisions
about
what
to
absorb
from
the
texts
I
was
exposed
to.
In
junior
year
English
class,
Mr.
Shustus
interpretations
of
the
class
readings
made
me
feel
like
there
was
a
huge
disconnect
between
me,
as
a
reader,
and
literature.
For
example,
I
could
not
relate
at
all
to
Mr.
Shustus
interpretation
of
the
Shakespearean
sonnet
(I
forget
exactly
which
one
it
was).
From
my
own
experiences,
I
did
not
agree
with
the
idea
that
rtrue
love
is
immutable.s
Sure,
I
knew
what
it
was
like
to
be
in
love;
I
had
had
several
crushes
and
even
a
girlfriend
by
the
time
I
was
a
junior.
I
also
believed
that
my
parents
loved
each
other,
and
I
was
pretty
sure
that
my
friends
loved
their
girlfriends
and
vice
versa.
But
I
also
had
seen
relationships
fall
apart,
and
I
knew
that
love,
in
a
lot
of
cases,
was
something
that
did
not
last
endlessly.
Yet,
I
did
not
believe
that
just
because
a
relationship
failed,
the
people
that
were
in
the
relationship
never
truly
loved
each
other.
Still,
I
had
to
memorize
the
clich#
theme
that
rtrue
love
is
immutable,s
and
I
had
to
write
about
it
in
an
assignment
as
if
I
was
convinced
of
its
truth.
I
had
no
choice
but
to
pretend
that
I
believed
in
the
theme
because
if
I
did
not,
I
would
have
failed
the
assignment.
As
Freire
states,
rto
alienate
human
beings
from
their
own
decision-making
is
to
change
them
into
objectss
(85).
In
this
way,
my
personal
beliefs
and
experiences
were
only
obstacles
that
Mr.
Shust
had
to
pacify
by
threatening
to
fail
me
in
order
to
force
me
to
accept
his
views
and
opinions.
Looking
back,
I
think
the
guy
had
a
serious
God
complex.
I
do
not
understand
how
a
person
could
possibly
believe
that
his
view
of
literature
could
be
absolute
and
final.
Barton
states
that
in
taking
meaning
from
a
text,
a
reader
carries
rout
operations
such
as
selection,
organization,
and
connecting
to
make
meaningss
(83).
It
follows
from
this
that
depending
on
what
parts
of
a
text
a
person
selects,
organizes,
and
connects
will
constitute
the
personus
interpretation.
According
to
Mr.
Shust,
studentsu
interpretations
of
literary
works
had
to
be
in
accordance
with
his
own
views.
Even
from
a
New
Critical
perspective,
this
does
not
seem
to
make
sense
because
numerous
coherent
interpretations
can
be
taken
from
the
same
text
depending
upon
which
parts
of
the
text
are
selected
by
the
reader
and
organized
to
constitute
a
textus
meaning.
The
English
class
I
took
senior
year
was
markedly
different
from
the
AP
course
I
had
junior
year.
Even
though
Mr.
Donnelly
was
also
a
New
Critic,
he
was
much
more
lenient
than
Mr.
Shust
in
allowing
his
students
to
develop
their
own
ideas
in
their
papers.
Although
the
format
of
the
assignments
remained
the
same,iaall
of
the
assignment
were
analytical
essaysiathe
class
atmosphere
was
very
relaxed.
I
enjoyed
the
class
because
Mr.
Donnelly
invited
students
to
share
their
opinions,
and
he
encouraged
group
discussions.
I
no
longer
had
to
worry
about
finding
the
rtrues
inherent
themes
in
course
readings,
which
was
a
welcome
relief,
and
I
was
free
to
explore
and
to
frame
my
own
arguments
in
my
papers.
All
in
all,
I
would
have
to
say
that
the
English
course
I
took
senior
year
was
my
favorite
English
course
in
high
school.
I
now
want
to
discuss
my
failures
and
my
successes
in
adapting
to
academic
life
in
college.
I
think
that
analyzing
my
freshman
year
experiences
is
important
because
they
demonstrate
how
my
high
school
literacy
development
hindered
my
acculturation
into
the
academic
life
of
Lafayette
College.
In
particular,
the
New
Critical
view
of
literature
that
I
had
developed
in
high
school
put
me
at
a
setback
for
succeeding
in
my
first
college
English
class.
In
addition,
I
think
analyzing
my
freshman
year
experiences
is
interesting
because
at
the
time,
I
significantly
changed
my
views
toward
reading
literature.
When
I
graduated
from
high
school,
I
had
no
idea
what
college
would
really
be
like,
and
I
did
not
know
what
I
would
encounter
in
college
classes.
At
the
time,
I
did
not
have
any
friends
in
college;
in
fact,
I
did
not
personally
know
anyone
that
had
ever
gone
and
lived
at
a
four-year
school.
I
had
talked
to
my
teachers
in
high
school
about
the
colleges
I
was
applying
to,
but
they
never
really
told
me
anything
enlightening
about
what
I
was
going
to
encounter.
Itus
fair
to
say
that
I
was
pretty
eager
at
that
point
in
time
for
some
advice
that
would
help
me
to
start
my
college
career
off
on
the
right
foot.
Before
coming
to
Lafayette,
I
attended
a
lunch
at
the
college
for
accepted
Marquis
Scholars,
and
I
was
introduced
to
several
professors.
When
I
told
one
of
the
English
professors
that
I
was
interested
in
being
an
English
major,
he
encouraged
me
to
take
his
Literary
History
course
in
the
fall.
I
thought
it
over
for
a
while,
and
when
I
saw
in
the
course
catalogue
that
Literary
History
was
required
for
the
English
major,
I
decided
to
enroll
in
the
course.
At
the
time,
I
do
not
think
that
I
had
any
forebodings
about
registering
for
the
class.
After
all,
the
professor
of
the
class
had
encouraged
me
to
take
it.
In
addition,
the
success
that
I
had
achieved
in
my
high
school
English
courses
made
me
very
confident
in
my
ability
to
write
papers
and
to
understand
texts.
At
the
time,
I
expected
that
my
transition
from
high
school
to
college
would
go
smoothly
because
I
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
would
not.
I
had
been
a
hard
worker
in
high
school,
and
I
had
always
excelled
in
school
because
of
my
academic
diligence.
Two
months
later,
I
was
surprised
when
I
found
myself
struggling
to
get
through
the
Literary
History
course.
The
big
problem
that
I
had
was
that
the
course
readings
were
really
difficult
for
me
to
understand.
I
found
the
poetry
segment
of
the
course
totally
unbearable
because
I
simply
could
not
make
sense
of
the
poetry
of
John
Donne
and
Shakespeare.
The
poems
were
written
in
English,
but
I
felt
as
if
I
were
reading
another
language.
I
was
encountering
archaic
words
that
I
had
never
seen
before,
and
even
the
spellings
of
the
basic
words
in
the
poems
differed
from
the
wordsu
modern
spellings.
In
addition,
I
had
no
understanding
of
the
literary
devices
in
the
poems
because
I
had
never
learned
about
themiaconceits,
metonymies,
synecdoche,
etcia
in
high
school.
I
remember
sitting
in
class
and
trying
to
write
down
everything
that
the
professor
was
saying
in
the
hopes
that,
after
class,
I
could
review
the
notes
and
could
make
sense
of
the
lecture.
The
extensive
note
taking,
however,
did
not
help
me
to
understand
either
the
readings
or
the
class
lectures.
After
a
while,
I
felt
like
I
was
totally
out
of
the
loop,
and
I
became
discouraged
from
taking
the
class
seriously.
I
guess
that
I
pretty
much
gave
up
on
doing
well
in
Literary
History
about
half-way
through
the
fall.
At
the
start
of
the
semester,
I
kept
up
on
the
course
readings,
and
I
tried
to
prepare
every
night
before
class
by
reviewing
my
notes.
After
I
started
failing
the
in-class
quizzes
on
the
readings
and
after
I
realized
that
my
notes
were
not
helping
me
to
understand
the
course
material,
I
stopped
caring
about
the
class.
I
started
partying
on
Wednesday
nights
even
if
it
meant
that
I
would
be
too
hung-over
to
attend
class
on
Thursday
morning.
I
even
stopped
doing
the
readings.
As
far
as
I
was
concerned,
I
had
tried
my
best
to
do
well
in
Literary
History,
and
I
had
failed.
At
the
time,
I
felt
pissed
off,
and
I
did
not
understand
why
the
professor
had
encouraged
me
to
register
for
a
class
that
I
was
unprepared
to
take.
I
was
also
frustrated
because
I
always
had
done
well
in
my
high
school
English
classes,
yet
in
college,
I
was
doing
miserably
in
the
intro-level
English
course
that
I
was
taking.
Even
though
I
had
never
been
exposed
to
philosophy
or
German
history
in
high
school,
I
still
did
fine
first
semester
in
my
Philosophy
101,
logic,
and
FYS
classes.
Nothing
had
prevented
me
from
excelling
in
those
courses.
I
simply
did
not
understand
what
I
was
doing
wrong
in
Literary
History.
In
retrospect,
I
think
part
of
my
problem
was
that
I
never
really
had
to
work
at
understanding
early
modern-English
literature.
The
editions
of
the
Shakespeare
plays
that
I
had
read
my
freshman
year
of
high
school
presented
the
Standard
English
version
alongside
the
playsu
original
versions.
In
addition,
I
had
never
really
been
exposed
to
reading
Shakespeare
and
Donneus
poetry.
During
the
few
times
that
I
had
read
sonnets
in
my
junior
year
of
high
school,
the
teachers
would
tell
us
the
poemsu
meanings,
and
I
simply
had
to
memorize
what
I
was
being
told.
I
never
had
to
work
at
understanding
either
the
poetry
or
the
arguments
and
claims
being
presented
in
the
texts.
In
college,
I
was
being
asked
to
read
and
understand
the
texts,
and
I
was
also
being
asked
to
analyze
and
to
criticize
the
poetryus
content.
In
high
school,
once
a
poem
was
interpreted,
the
arguments
in
the
poetry
were
accepted
as
general
truths.
As
a
student,
I
was
never
asked
to
draw
broader
conclusions
about
how
the
poems
were
reflective
of
gender
roles
in
society
or
how
the
poems
implicitly
expressed
ideological
views.
In
fact,
in
high
school,
I
was
discouraged
from
deviating
from
what
was
being
taught
as
the
general
rtruths
of
the
poem.
In
Literary
History,
I
was
required
to
invoke
complex
reading
strategies
to
complete
the
assignments
and
to
participate
in
class
discussions.
In
the
online
Lafayette
College
Course
Catalogue,
the
description
of
the
Literary
History
course
states
that
the
class
rinquires
into
the
specific
cultural
practices
that
construct
tliterature,u
engaging
students
in
an
exploration
of
canon
formation,
marginalization,
intertextuality,
and
influences
(Lafayette
Course
Catalogue).
As
a
student
entering
Lafayette
College,
I
did
not
know
anything
about
either
the
canon
or
how
it
had
been
traditionally
used
to
exclude
minority
and
female
authors
from
being
read
in
the
Academy
and
in
society.
In
addition,
because
I
had
been
conditioned
in
high
school
to
have
a
New
Critical
view
of
literature,
I
was
not
aware
that
rliterature,s
as
a
concept,
was
culturally
and
socially
determined.
I
simply
thought
that
certain
books
retained
their
objective
statuses
as
literature
because
they
were
timeless
and
valuable
pieces
of
writing.
In
this
way,
I
implicitly
endorsed
the
same
canonical
view
of
literature
that
was
being
examined,
attacked,
and
undermined
in
the
Literary
History
course.
Consequently,
I
think
that
the
restrictive
ways
in
which
I
viewed
literature
and
its
cultural
functions
prevented
me
from
engaging
in
the
discourse
of
the
classroom.
In
the
essay
rLiteracy,
Discourse,
and
Linguistics,s
James
Gee
discusses
how
discourse
communities
function
and
how
people
can
fail
to
become
acculturated
into
new
and
unfamiliar
discourses.
According
to
Gee,
a
personus
becoming
a
discourse
participant
involves
oneus
learning
ra
socially
accepted
association
among
ways
of
using
language,
of
thinking,
and
of
acting
that
can
be
used
to
identify
oneself
as
a
member
of
a
socially
meaningful
group
or
tsocial
networkus
(537).
In
the
Literary
History
class
that
I
took
freshman
year,
I
was
not
familiar
with
a
lot
of
the
literary
terms
and
conceptsiaoppression,
patriarchy,
intertextualityiabeing
used
in
class,
and
I
had
very
restrictive
ways
of
viewing
and
analyzing
the
course
readings
because
of
the
New
Critical
view
of
literature
that
I
had
developed
in
high
school.
As
Gee
states,
rsomeone
cannot
engage
in
a
Discourse
in
a
less
than
fully
fluent
manner.
You
are
either
in
it
or
youure
nots
(529).
In
this
way,
I
was
not
able
to
participate
in
the
discourse
community
of
the
classroom
because
my
New
Critical
perspective
of
literature
conditioned
me
to
look
at
and
to
analyze
literature
in
ways
that
differed
from
the
critical
methods
that
were
being
used
in
the
course.
Worse
yet,
because
New
Criticism
espouses
the
belief
that
works
of
literature
should
be
evaluated
independently
of
their
authorship
and
of
the
historical
conditions
in
which
they
were
produced,
my
literary
attitudes
made
me
highly
resistant
to
adopting
the
postcolonial
methods
of
analysis
being
utilized
in
the
classroom
discussions
and
lectures.
This
resistance
is
reflective
of
the
rtension
or
conflict
[that
can
be]
present
between
any
two
of
a
personus
discourses,s
and
such
tension
Gee
claims,
rcan
deter
acquisition
of
one
or
the
other
or
both
of
the
conflicting
discoursess
(528).
I
guess
the
professor
assumed
that
I
had
been
exposed
to
different
critical
reading
strategies
in
high
school,
which
would
explain
why
he
had
suggested
me
to
take
the
course
in
the
first
place.
Yet,
the
fact
was
that
I
had
only
performed
New
Critical
readings
of
texts
in
high
school.
Marie
Louis
Prattus
article
rThe
Arts
of
the
Contact
Zones
helps
to
explain
why
I
was
not
able
to
adapt
my
view
of
literature
in
the
Literary
History
class.
According
to
Pratt,
contact
zones
are
the
rsocial
spaces
where
cultures
meet,
clash,
and
grapple
with
each
other,
often
in
contexts
of
highly
asymmetrical
relations
of
powers
(584).
In
looking
back
upon
my
experiences
in
Literary
History,
I
believe
that
the
classroom
environment
could
be
considered
a
rcontact
zones
because
the
New
Critical
attitudes
that
I
had
developed
in
high
school
and
that
I
was
bringing
into
the
college
classroom
clashed,
so
to
speak,
with
the
postcolonial
reading
strategies
that
were
being
utilized
in
the
class.
In
addition,
my
implicit
support
of
a
literary
canon
was
a
source
of
conflict
with
the
classroom
culture
because
the
traditional
Western
Canon
was
being
undermined
in
the
course
itself.
In
this
way,
my
New
Critical
views
and
my
ways
of
thinking
about
literature
prevented
me
from
being
acculturated
into
the
discourse
community
of
the
classroom.
In
a
way,
I
believe
that
the
classroom
environment
of
the
Literary
History
class
could
also
be
considered,
what
Pratt
calls,
an
rimagined
community,s
in
which
discourse
participants
do
not
have
actual
knowledge
of
one
another;
rather,
they
only
have
imagined
conceptions
of
each
other
(591).
In
classroom
settings,
these
imagined
conceptions
are
based
upon
the
notion
that
the
members
of
the
class
community
posses
common
rprinciples
of
cooperation
and
shared
understandings
(592).
In
this
sense,
perhaps
the
professor
of
the
Literary
History
course
had
the
imagined
conception
that
all
of
the
students
were
operating
with
the
same
views
and
attitudes
of
literature
that
he
was
espousing
in
the
class.
Because
of
this
imagined
conception,
the
professor
expected
all
of
the
students
to
be
capable
of
grasping
the
ideas
he
was
expressing,
of
understanding
the
reading
strategies
he
was
invoking
in
the
class
lectures,
and
of
understanding
literature
as
products
of
culture
and
of
historical
circumstances.
If
this
were
the
case,
then
my
failure
in
Literary
History
can
be
partially
explained
by
the
fact
that
I,
as
a
real
student,
did
not
conform
to
or
comport
with
my
professorus
imagined
conception
of
who
I
was.
I
had
never
been
exposed
to
different
forms
of
literary
criticism,
and
I
had
been
conditioned
throughout
high
school
to
accept
the
restrictive
tenets
of
New
Criticism.
In
this
way,
I
simply
did
not
live
up
to
the
expectations,
to
the
imagined
conception,
that
my
professor
had
of
me.
Thinking
back,
I
should
have
gone
to
the
professor
to
ask
how
I
could
have
done
better,
but
because
I
felt
alienated
from
what
was
going
on
in
the
class
and
because
I
was
doing
so
poorly,
and
I
felt
like
there
was
no
way
for
me
to
succeed.
After
Literary
History,
I
decided
to
take
the
Literary
Questions
course
in
the
spring
semester.
Literary
Questions
was
the
course
I
should
have
taken
first
semester.
According
to
the
online
course
description,
Literary
Questions
rprovides
students
with
an
introduction
to
the
theory
and
methodology
of
literary
study
by
focusing
on
three
questions:
what
is
a
literary
text?
How
do
we
read
a
literary
text?
How
do
we
write
about
a
literary
text?s
(Lafayette
Course
Catalogue)
In
addition,
the
course
asks
students
rexamine
their
assumptions
about
literatures
(Lafayette
Course
Catalogue).
Because
Literary
Questions
was
asking
me
to
challenge
my
assumptions
about
literature,
my
New
Critical
views
and
values
did
not
prevent
me
from
participating
in
the
discourse
of
the
class.
Rather,
I
was
free
to
express
my
views
so
long
as
I
was
willing
to
listen
to
the
criticisms
that
others
had
of
my
beliefs.
The
course
also
broadened
my
understanding
of
literature
because
it
introduced
me
to
new
critical
ways
through
which
I
could
analyze
texts.
In
Literary
Questions
I
read
about
the
explicit
tenets
of
New
Criticism,
and
I
was
exposed
to
the
objections
mounted
against
it
as
a
critical
theory.
At
first,
I
found
it
difficult
to
adjust
to
the
class.
After
all,
I
was
attempting
to
unlearn
reading
and
writing
habits
that
had
been
engrained
in
me
throughout
my
high
school
career.
I
still
excelled
in
the
class,
I
believe,
because
once
I
understood
the
shortcomings
and
failures
of
New
Criticism,
I
no
longer
wanted
to
hold
to
its
beliefs
and
values.
In
a
way,
the
classroom
instruction
that
I
received
in
Literary
Questions
was
liberating
because
I
was
no
longer
trapped
in
the
role
of
a
New
Critic.
Gee
refers
to
this
type
of
liberation
as
rmeta-knowledge,s
which
is
being
able
to
see
rhow
the
Discourses
you
have
already
got
relate
to
those
you
are
attempting
to
acquire,
and
how
the
ones
you
are
trying
to
acquire
relate
to
self
and
societys
(532).
From
my
experiences
in
the
class,
I
donut
know
if
there
was
a
distinct
discourse
that
I
was
attempting
to
acquire;
however,
the
class
allowed
me
to
view
a
smorgasbord
of
critical
theories,
all
of
which
tested
and
demeaned
the
adequacy
of
New
Criticism.
In
learning
about
different
critical
theories
and
in
rejecting
the
tenets
of
New
criticism,
I
believe
that
I
became
a
better
and
more
liberal
minded
student
because
I
realized
that
works
of
literature
are
complex
and
are
deserving
of
many
different
interpretations.
In
a
way,
I
also
believe
that
I
have
become
liberated
because
I
am
now
capable
of
constructing
my
own
interpretations
of
texts,
which
do
not
necessarily
have
to
rely
on
previous
interpretations
to
be
legitimated.
I
guess
that
Literary
Questions
put
the
nail
in
the
coffin
of
my
New
Critical
views
of
literature.
