Writing
Associate
Memoir
August
16,
2004
I
love
to
know
more
than
everyone
around
me,
and
to
excel
at
everything
I
do.
Even
now,
as
I
sit
attempting
to
reflect
upon
my
life
as
a
writer,
it
is
taking
me
hours
just
to
think
of
the
way
that
I
wish
to
portray
the
past
nineteen
years
of
my
life.
I
donOt
want
my
life
shown
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
others
think
that
I
am
in
any
way
beneath
my
peers.
The
possibility
that
I
could
be
criticized
is
something
that
has
always
held
me
back.
If
I
know
that
there
is
something
I
do
extremely
well,
I
want
the
best
possible
example
of
my
work
displayed.
This
has
been
true
in
everything,
from
running,
to
singing
in
public,
to
having
others
read
my
writing.
I
have
always
thought
that
writing
is
a
very
personal
ability.
If
someone
does
poorly
in
math,
then
one
may
teach
him
exactly
the
step
where
he
went
wrong.
In
writing,
that
step
could
be
miles
back.
A
person
could
be
a
talented
writer,
but
they
may
be
limited
by
their
grammar
or
vocabulary.
I
am
a
perfectionist,
and
this
has
probably
held
me
back
from
being
better
at
something
as
private
and
complex
as
writing.
My
first
experiences
with
reading
and
writing
came
with
my
parents,
who
are
fourth
grade
teachers.
Teachers
have
a
quality
which
propels
them
forward
into
wanting
to
enlighten
every
person
they
meet.
Everyone
is
a
teacher
in
some
way.
When
I
meet
people,
I
teach
them
about
the
ocean.
When
my
parents
met
me,
they
taught
me
everything
they
could.
My
father
asked
me
mathematical
questions
when
my
peers
were
just
learning
to
add.
Both
of
my
parents
taught
me
to
love
reading
and
writing.
Having
a
young
mind
to
mold
was
probably
the
most
exciting
thing
in
the
world
for
them.
My
mother
never
bought
me
Barbie
dolls.
Instead,
I
had
blocks
and
creative
games.
One
of
my
first
memories
is
of
listening
to
my
parents
read
Goodnight
Moon
to
me,
which
I
heard
every
night
until
I
was
five.
They
read
books
to
me
every
day,
and
I
attended
a
nursery
school
where
we
read
a
lot
as
well.
At
the
age
of
three,
I
had
books
in
both
Portuguese
and
English
memorized
because
my
parents
read
to
me
so
much.
Since
my
mother
did
not
work
when
I
was
young,
we
went
to
the
library
almost
every
single
day.
My
mother
had
the
schedule
of
the
library
memorized,
just
so
that
we
could
attend
all
of
the
mother-child
activities.
I
can
still
remember
everything
about
my
library,
from
the
games
to
the
story
time,
even
though
it
is
now
quite
changed.
When
I
went
to
school
at
age
five,
I
was
very
lucky
to
be
living
in
Farmington,
Connecticut.
The
schools
in
my
town
are
very
well
off,
in
monetary
resources
as
well
as
parental
involvement.
As
I
look
through
my
writing
as
an
elementary
student,
I
see
multiple
stories
that
I
have
written.
There
are
stories
about
subjects
such
as
my
family,
my
trip
to
Cape
Cod,
and
my
imaginary
friend.
These
books
are
all
bound,
with
artistic
covers
and
my
illustrations.
The
most
exciting
part
of
elementary
school
was
publishing
a
book.
I
remember
working
for
hours
on
the
story,
and
then
deciding
which
lines
went
on
which
page.
All
of
the
students
loved
to
write
stories
that
would
be
published
because
they
were
such
an
impressive
gift
to
a
parent.
Publishing
was
truly
a
way
to
get
kids
motivated
to
enjoy
writing.
In
third
grade,
I
had
my
first
assignment
of
a
research
paper.
I
chose
to
write
my
essay
about
an
elephant,
which
has
always
been
my
favorite
animal.
I
then
proceeded
to
not
do
any
work
on
the
project,
until
the
weekend
before
it
was
due
when
I
broke
down
in
front
of
my
mother
and
told
her
that
I
had
a
paper
to
write
about
elephants.
Instead
of
berating
me,
my
mother
brought
me
to
the
Farmington
library,
and
we
took
out
every
single
book
about
elephants
that
was
geared
towards
children.
I
then
sat
at
the
kitchen
table
for
the
next
two
days
and
read
and
wrote
about
my
favorite
animal.
Once
I
started
writing,
the
feeling
of
dread
which
had
been
building
up
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
for
the
past
few
weeks
began
to
subside.
I
knew
that
once
I
started
writing,
I
would
be
able
to
finish.
I
did
finish
that
project.
My
mother
came
to
watch
when
I
presented
it,
and
I
received
an
A
plus.
This
was
my
first
encounter
with
procrastination,
and
though
the
outcome
was
positive,
I
have
always
remembered
this
weekend
when
I
am
procrastinating
while
doing
other
projects.
In
fourth
grade,
I
was
one
of
the
best
creative
writers
in
my
class.
I
would
spend
all
forty
minutes
that
the
Connecticut
Mastery
Test
allowed,
and
I
would
still
not
finish
my
detailed
and
extensive
stories.
Every
month,
we
would
sit
down
and
write
a
creative
story
which
was
based
on
a
former
question
of
the
Connecticut
Mastery
Test.
I
loved
to
create
elaborate
tales
regarding
children
who
were
very
rich,
or
who
lived
in
a
candy
store
with
their
eight
dogs.
My
stories
provided
me
with
a
way
to
live
a
fantasy
world.
I
truly
enjoyed
writing
because
it
allowed
me
to
put
myself
in
another
situation.
I
decided
that
I
wanted
to
be
an
author,
and
write
novels
geared
for
children.
I
was
creative,
and
I
loved
to
write.
During
the
fall
of
fourth
grade,
they
gave
us
a
new
assignment,
NYour
school
board
is
thinking
about
enforcing
a
new
rule
which
would
require
students
to
wear
uniforms.
Please
write
a
letter
to
school
board
arguing
whether
or
not
you
believe
this
is
a
good
idea.O
I
treated
this
essay
just
like
every
other
writing
assignment
that
I
had
had
throughout
my
four
years
as
a
writer.
I
created
a
detailed
story
about
a
little
girl
who
had
to
wear
uniforms
to
school.
When
we
received
our
graded
essays,
I
was
appalled
to
see
that
I
had
only
gotten
a
three!
I
normally
got
at
least
a
score
of
a
nine,
with
a
twelve
being
the
highest
possible
ranking.
Mrs.
Becker
then
proceeded
to
explain
that
we
were
supposed
to
have
written
a
five
paragraph
essay.
We
needed
an
introduction,
which
clearly
stated
our
opinion
on
the
subject
of
a
dress
code.
We
then
needed
to
have
three
supporting
reasons,
each
of
which
would
be
explained
in
the
following
three
paragraphs.
At
the
end,
we
needed
a
conclusion,
which
would
once
again
explain
our
position.
I
was
so
hurt
at
this
point.
I
was
a
good
writer,
and
the
teachers
had
tricked
us!
They
had
known
that
we
would
write
stories!
I
remained
convinced
that
my
fourth
grade
teacher
had
tricked
me
up
until
a
few
years
ago.
In
addition
to
writing
optimistic
stories,
I
also
used
a
diary
in
order
to
convey
my
aspirations.
Every
little
girl
keeps
a
diary
at
one
point,
and
this
too
is
a
significant
part
of
oneOs
progressions
in
writing.
My
diary
was
blue,
with
a
rainbow
and
a
pony
on
it.
It
had
a
lock
on
it,
which
could
easily
have
been
picked
with
a
paperclip.
However,
I
kept
it
hidden,
and
the
keys
were
secretly
tucked
away
in
a
different,
inconspicuous
spot.
I
wrote
in
my
diary
throughout
my
childhood.
I
had
it
beginning
at
age
seven.
I
tried
to
make
myself
write
in
it
every
day.
But,
the
only
times
I
remembered
to
write
were
when
I
was
sad.
In
fifth
grade,
the
concept
of
popularity
began.
My
first
experience
with
popularity
was
dramatically
captured
in
a
few
lines
of
my
diary:
NI
was
absent
yesterday
and
when
I
came
back
today
Kelsey
and
Megan
and
some
other
girls
were
all
sitting
on
one
side
of
the
playground.
And
when
I
went
over
to
talk
to
Megan
(whoOs
my
best
friend)
Kelsey
hit
me
with
her
lunchbox
and
told
me
to
go
away.O
I
wrote
every
hurtful
experience
such
as
this
one
in
my
diary,
and
used
it
to
release
all
of
these
negative
emotions.
Paideia
was
the
most
evil
word
in
the
language
of
a
student
at
Irving
A.
Robbins
middle
school.
It
was
worse
than
Npopularity,O
worse
even
than
Nschool
baked
macaroni.O
Paideia
was
the
single
most
grueling,
stressful,
mentally
demanding
test
of
endurance
throughout
oneOs
entire
middle
school
career.
The
rigorous
process,
wrought
with
various
academic
challenges,
consumed
a
precious
four
months
of
eighth
grade.
The
assignment
was
a
research
paper.
Each
student
had
to
pick
a
subject
in
history
that
had
to
do
with
the
town
of
Farmington,
whether
it
was
the
Underground
Railroad
or
architecture.
We
then
had
to
research
our
subject
without
the
help
of
any
teachers.
Though
our
history
teachers
brought
us
to
the
school
library,
I
took
the
initiative
and
used
primary
resources
in
both
of
the
Farmington
libraries,
as
well
as
a
slavery
exhibit
in
West
Hartford.
I
spent
weeks
writing
the
research
paper
and
creating
an
impressive
poster
board
presentation
of
what
I
had
learned
about
FarmingtonOs
role
in
the
Underground
Railroad.
This
essay
was
the
first
assignment
for
which
I
was
forced
to
undertake
a
great
deal
of
time
outside
of
school.
I
motivated
myself
and
found
that
I
could
indeed
write
an
extensive
research
paper
without
procrastinating,
and
without
the
assistance
of
my
teachers
and
my
parents.
Throughout
middle
school
and
my
first
two
years
of
high
school,
analytical
essays
were
the
primary
pieces
of
writing
which
I
composed.
I
absolutely
hated
writing
essays.
I
have
always
loved
to
read,
because
it
was
such
a
main
source
of
entertainment
for
me
throughout
my
childhood.
I
read
everything
as
a
child,
from
The
Baby-Sitters
Club
series
to
Jurassic
Park
to
the
Redwall
series.
In
middle
school
we
read
such
intense
books
as
The
Giver
and
The
Cage.
While
my
peers
hated
these
mandatory
reading
assignments,
I
enjoyed
almost
every
novel
that
was
required
of
me.
However,
I
hated
having
to
take
apart
each
and
every
book
that
I
read
for
school.
I
found
it
so
hard,
and
felt
that
analyzing
a
book
destroyed
its
appeal.
My
mother
said
that
I
did
not
learn
how
to
write
essays
well
when
I
was
in
elementary
school.
I
just
thought
that
essay
writing
was
boring.
My
junior
year
of
high
school
was
a
turning
point
in
my
writing
career.
I
had
gotten
through
years
of
essay
writing,
and
had
remained
in
the
top
of
my
English
classes.
Though
I
did
not
enjoy
writing
essays,
I
was
good
at
it.
As
soon
as
my
junior
year
began,
we
were
asked
to
read
various
novels
and
then
Nanalyze
the
rhetorical
devices
which
the
author
used
in
order
to
create
the
tone
of
his
novel.O
What
the
heck
did
that
mean?
Even
after
looking
through
all
of
the
information
that
we
had
received,
I
still
had
no
idea
what
to
do.
I
finally
wrote
the
essay
and
scored
a
three.
A
three
out
of
nine
would
not
get
one
very
far
in
Advanced
Placement
English
Language.
Everyone
around
me
seemed
to
understand
how
to
write
these
new
essays.
They
could
easily
find
the
diction,
imagery,
details,
language,
and
syntax
that
were
hidden
in
the
passages.
I
felt
thoroughly
under-prepared
for
the
course.
My
teacher
offered
extra
help
throughout
the
year,
which
I
gladly
abused
throughout
the
year.
My
study
halls
were
all
spent
in
the
English
office,
as
I
received
help
from
more
than
one
of
the
English
teachers.
I
was
motivated
by
the
fact
that
I
did
not
want
to
fall
behind
my
classmates.
I
worked
harder
than
anyone
else
in
my
Advanced
Placement
class
that
year.
At
some
points,
I
was
meeting
with
my
English
teacher
daily
in
order
to
work
on
essays
that
had
already
been
graded,
and
whose
perfection
didnOt
matter.
By
the
time
the
exam
came
in
May,
I
still
felt
as
though
I
had
a
great
deal
to
learn.
Though
I
was
finally
regularly
receiving
scores
of
a
six
or
seven,
the
grades
of
most
of
my
classmates
were
significantly
higher.
I
decided
that
I
was
not
an
NEnglish
person,O
but
took
the
exam
anyways,
in
the
hope
that
I
would
receive
a
passing
grade.
July
2002
was
a
relaxing
time.
So
relaxing,
in
fact,
that
I
had
practically
forgotten
about
the
Advanced
Placement
tests
which
I
had
taken
the
previous
May.
When
my
scores
came
in
the
mail,
I
expected
a
four
or
five
on
my
Biology
and
United
States
History
exams.
I
was
pleasantly
surprised;
I
had
received
fours
on
all
of
the
exams.
After
working
so
hard
all
year,
I
had
earned
a
four
on
the
English
exam.
I
was
most
proud
of
this
one
score
than
any
other
grade
that
I
had
gotten
that
year.
After
this,
I
felt
much
better
prepared
for
my
Advanced
Placement
English
Literature
course.
When
I
entered
Lafayette
College
last
fall,
my
writing
ability
was
not
something
that
I
thought
would
hold
me
back.
An
entering
freshman
has
enough
to
worry
about
without
fearing
they
will
not
succeed
in
their
courses.
When
I
got
my
first
assignment
in
my
First
Year
Seminar,
I
thought
about
it
for
days
before
writing
a
sentence.
I
proceeded
to
write
a
first
draft,
and
had
various
people
read
it.
I
loved
having
my
wa
available,
because
she
offered
unbiased
help
from
someone
who
had
experienced
college
essay
writing.
When
I
finally
handed
in
my
first
paper,
I
wasnOt
afraid
that
I
would
fail.
Instead,
I
was
convinced
that
I
would
do
well.
