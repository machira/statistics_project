The
beginning
of
my
life
as
a
writer
was
excruciatingly
mundane.
I
struggled
with
fine
motor
skillsNmy
handwriting
was
labored,
to
say
the
leastNand
being
forced
to
use
the
complex
cursive
alphabet
didnOt
help.
At
the
end
of
the
day,
I
always
had
a
dent
in
my
index
finger
where
kept
my
pencil
in
a
death
grip.
My
first-grade
writing
journal
was
filled
with
the
stock
sentences
that
I
learned
were
expected
of
me:
NI
like
Pizza.O
NI
like
Legos.O
NI
like
Star
Wars.O
One
day,
with
a
jolt
of
creative
inspiration,
I
wrote
a
vivid
paragraph
detailing
the
subtle
and
delectable
intricacies
of
my
momOs
homemade
apple
crisp.
The
scents,
the
sights,
and
the
sounds
of
the
golden
cinnamon
apples
were
all
highlighted
in
what
was
to
that
point
my
most
creative
endeavor.
But
alas,
in
my
frantic
and
joyful
moment
of
self-expression,
I
didnOt
leave
large
enough
spaces
between
the
words.
My
teacher
was
not
pleased,
and
I
had
to
erase
it
and
start
over.
My
mother,
a
strong
advocate
for
creative
writing,
had
me
pulled
from
that
old
philistineOs
class
within
a
week.
I
was
then
enrolled
at
the
Sparhawk
School,
which
was
at
the
complete
opposite
end
of
the
learning
spectrum;
in
fact,
it
eventually
devolved
into
a
sort
of
hippy
commune
for
children.
Here
we
had
recess
for
almost
half
of
the
school
day,
during
which
time
we
were
encouraged
to
make
discoveries
for
ourselves.
On
my
first
day,
sprawled
on
the
floor,
I
wrote
my
first
short
story.
Titled
NThe
Ghost
of
Terror,O
it
was
about
a
friendly
neon
pink
ghost
that
haunted
the
school.
The
rest
of
my
elementary
school
years
were
filled
with
writing.
This
was
where
I
learned
the
writing
process:
drafting,
revising,
conferencing
and
I
even
had
some
of
my
stories
NpublishedO
Dwe
laminated
the
pages
and
bound
them
together.
By
middle
school,
I
graduated
from
pen
and
pencil
to
typing
on
a
computer.
I
had
a
great
English
teacher
who
encouraged
us
to
write
and
didnOt
restrict
us
too
closely
to
specific
assignments.
Inspired
by
Jerry
SpinelliOs
Knots
in
My
Yo-Yo
String,
I
wrote
my
own
autobiography.
Fortunately,
I
was
mature
enough
to
recognize
the
humor
in
an
eleven-year-old
writing
his
autobiography.
Topics
varied
from
food
and
the
memorable
Thanksgiving
of
O03
to
the
proper
technique
for
flopping
on
the
couchNthere
is
one,
and
I
had
it
down
to
a
science.
My
middle
school
self
churned
out
severable
memorable
pieces.
In
seventh
grade,
my
excitement
for
writing
had
certainly
not
diminishedNassigned
a
two
page
short
story,
I
wrote
an
epic
eighteen-page
masterpiece
titled
NThe
Perfect
DayO.
The
story
was
anything
but
subtleNit
was
about
a
day
in
which
everything
went
wrong.
When
the
tranquility
of
what
is
very
closely
based
off
of
my
grandparents'
lake
house
is
shattered
by
a
NBrobdingnagianO
sea
monster,
my
main
character
is
haunted
by
memories
of
his
past
career
as
a
firefighter
as
he
battles
the
monster.
It
was
fun
to
write:
staying
up
late,
thrilled
with
the
creation,
I
popped
HersheyOs
kisses
for
the
caffeineNbut
I
didnOt
need
it.
I
laughed
out
loud
as
I
came
up
with
ironic
twists,
and
nodded
to
myself
as
I
invented
turns
in
the
plot
or
smiled
at
some
clever
bit
of
language.
I
got
a
huge
kick
out
of
using
big
words
and
I
love
language.
Sitting
in
the
dark
in
my
room,
washed
in
the
glow
of
the
old
Gateway
monitor,
I
could
hardly
type
fast
enough
as
the
ideas
flowed.
This
was
also
a
fantastic
way
to
begin
to
get
accustomed
to
using
literary
devices
effectively.
To
foreshadow
the
horror
of
the
day
to
come,
I
described
the
main
character
waking
to
a
bird
killing
itself
by
flying
into
his
bedroom
window.
And
in
case
that
wasnOt
quite
enough,
I
went
on
to
describe
how
beautifully
the
sun
was
shining
through
the
window
and
how
it
would
be
a
perfect
day,
except
for
the
fact
he
couldnOt
go
back
to
sleep
because
the
birdOs
blood
on
the
window
Ncast
him
in
a
red
glow.O
When
I
read
this
recently,
I
laughed
at
how
over
the
top
this
was.
Subtlety
was
not
my
strength.
In
seventh
grade,
I
elected
to
be
part
of
National
History
day,
which
meant
for
the
first
half
of
the
year,
my
entire
history
class
was
devoted
to
one
research
topic
of
my
choice.
I
chose
the
Chernobyl
nuclear
disaster.
I
was
switched
into
a
class
with
only
other
people
participating
in
History
Day,
and
of
these
twenty
or
so
kids,
there
was
only
one
other
person
who
of
chose
to
write
a
20-page
paper
instead
of
making
a
poster
or
building
a
diorama
or
something.
This
was
my
first
time
attempting
quality
historical
nonfiction.
Writing
a
paper
for
a
history
class
is
a
different
kind
of
writing
than
writing
stories
for
an
English
class,
and
up
to
that
point,
non-fiction
writing
hadnOt
been
something
that
I
had
put
much
effort
into.
But
I
applied
myself
to
this
because
it
was
a
topic
that
I
was
interested
in
and
I
was
my
own
bossNI
was
in
charge
of
everything
about
that
paper.
There
was
no
rubric,
which
was
not
the
case
for
the
majority
of
my
middle
school
career;
I
had
to
organize
the
attack
of
finding
and
summing
massive
amounts
of
primary
source
information
into
twenty
clear,
structured
pages.
At
the
end
of
the
project,
I
had
become
good
friends
with
the
other
boy
in
my
class
also
writing
a
paper,
and
after
a
panel
of
judges
at
Plymouth
State
University
berated
us
about
the
quality
of
our
papers,
I
was
awarded
a
gold
medal
and
he
won
silver.
Thankfully,
this
didnOt
create
a
rift
in
our
friendship,
and
we
laughed
at
the
fact
that
we
were
the
only
two
kids
in
the
state
of
New
Hampshire
who
voluntarily
wrote
twenty-page
papers
In
high
school,
the
entire
focus
of
English
throughout
all
four
years
was
on
personal
narratives
and
by
senior
year,
personal
essays.
My
early
narratives
were
entirely
based
off
of
writing
in
a
humorous
colloquial
voice
and
making
ordinary
situations
funny.
Looking
back,
I
was
trying
to
follow
David
Sedaris
in
my
writing
style.
When
we
got
to
read
our
papers
in
class,
I
always
got
a
bunch
of
laughs
because
I
was
articulate
enough
to
describe
ordinary
things
in
an
unconventional
manner.
I
loved
that
my
writing
was
appreciated.
In
one
narrative
I
described
the
sound
effects
my
younger
brother
made
when
playing
as
reminiscent
of
a
sacrificial
pig
slaughter
and
in
another
narrative
I
depicted
a
conversation
I
overheard
in
a
Best
Buy
in
which
a
salesman
haggled
with
an
8-year-old
boy.
At
the
end
of
junior
year,
everyone
was
required
to
write
an
extensive
research
paper
based
almost
entirely
on
primary
source
documents
about
any
aspect
of
US
history.
Like
my
history
day
project,
I
got
excited
about
it.
I
researched
the
trials
of
Sacco
and
Vanzetti,
two
Italian
immigrants
who
were
accused
of
murder
and
robbery
and
sentenced
to
the
electric
chair,
although
there
was
almost
no
solid
evidence
that
they
had
committed
any
crimes
and
the
trial
was
more
about
prejudice
and
stereotypes.
Being
totally
in
control
of
what
I
wanted
to
write,
how
I
wanted
to
write
it
was
both
a
great
exercise
in
discipline
and
also
made
it
much
more
enjoyable
for
me.
I
remember
the
content
feeling
I
had
sitting
in
my
carrel
in
the
library
for
hours
on
a
rainy
afternoon,
stacks
of
books
and
articles
feet
high
totally
surrounding
my
laptop.
This
experienceNboth
the
research
and
the
writingNtaught
me
to
write
a
complex
analytical
paper.
Basic
writing
techniques
become
very
important
to
keep
the
paper
focused,
like
effectively
using
topic
sentences.
It
was
a
very
different
kind
of
writing
than
I
was
accustomed
to
in
my
English
class,
where
I
wrote
personal
narratives,
a
genre
that
thrives
off
of
free
flowing
progression
of
ideas
as
opposed
to
encompassing
a
large
amount
of
information
in
a
clear
and
concise
way.
Towards
the
end
of
my
high
school
career,
I
started
to
have
a
better
grasp
on
metaphor.
Once
I
started
to
get
what
you
could
do
with
metaphor
and
supposedly
NhiddenO
meaning,
I
set
out
to
make
my
writing
as
subtle
as
possible.
In
one
assignment,
I
was
supposed
to
write
a
meditation,
which
was
defined
as
a
lengthy,
reflective
personal
essay.
In
the
end,
it
was
a
series
of
images
or
scenes
that
were
seemingly
unrelated.
I
titled
it
NOn
Change,
Immutability,
and
PerceptionO
and
the
general
idea
was
that
I
proposed
an
answer
to
the
question
Ndo
things
ever
change?O
My
answer
was
that
it
depended
on
your
perception.
But
I
never
said
anything
about
that,
I
just
described
everything
from
my
dadOs
old
corvette
to
the
time
I
launched
a
model
rocket
when
I
was
little
to
a
picture
I
saw
once.
Although
to
the
common
reader
it
would
have
been
nearly
impossible
to
come
to
the
conclusions
that
I
was
hoping
you
might
come
to,
it
was
a
great
exercise
in
taking
that
old
adage
Nshow
donOt
tellO
to
an
extreme.
I
didnOt
give
anything
away.
My
senior
spring
I
opted
to
do
a
senior
project
and
over
the
course
of
the
term
write
a
collection
of
short
stories
instead
of
taking
an
English
class.
By
the
end
of
the
term
I
had
four
stories,
although
only
one
was
polished
enough,
or
nearly
polished
enough
for
me
to
consider
complete.
After
all
the
years
of
writing
the
truth
and
writing
about
my
life,
it
was
so
hard
to
branch
out
and
realize
literally
anything
could
happen.
I
was
torn
between
the
stark
and
subtle
style
of
Hemingway
and
the
bizarre
scenarios
of
Haruki
Murakami.
I
also
learned
a
valuable
lessonNin
a
short
story
there
has
to
be
a
plotE
something
has
to
happen.
I
could
no
longer
get
by
on
my
careful
observations
of
human
nature
and
poetic
descriptive
language.
I
had
to
create
a
plot.
My
favorite
story
was
about
the
sad
love
affair
between
an
obese,
dying
overzealous
security
officer
and
a
middle
age
woman
who
caught
rodents
for
a
living
in
the
North
Country.
Many
of
the
characters
and
elements
of
the
story
are
based
on
notes
I've
taken
about
real
people
and
events.
This
was
the
beginning
of
my
habit,
which
contuse
to
this
day,
of
recording
observations
as
I
go
about
my
life.
It
is
all
food
for
future
stories.
By
the
end
of
my
senior
year,
I
had
stopped
writing
for
my
classmatesO
amusement
and
more
for
my
own
amusement.
I
got
such
a
kick
out
of
the
ironic
twists
my
stories
would
take.
I
had
fun
brainstorming
with
my
friends
or
even
on
my
own.
I
got
stuck
when
I
kept
rejecting
ideas
on
the
basis
that
they
NwerenOt
good
enough;O
I
felt
like
I
had
to
establish
myself
as
a
writer
by
writing
excellently,
which
put
me
and
my
writing
in
gridlock
for
weeks.
That
spring,
I
roamed
the
campus
just
to
think.
I
bumped
into
my
advisor
for
the
project
one
evening
and
he
said
that
I
looked
like
a
writerNall
I
needed
was
a
pipe
and
a
jacket
with
patches
on
the
elbows.
I
got
a
small
taste
of
what
writers
do
and
what
it
was
like
to
have
the
time
to
write.
Besides
all
of
the
specific
things
IOve
learned
about
writing,
like
the
significance
of
plot
or
topic
sentences,
IOve
learned
I
need
space
to
write
well.
IOve
learned
that
I
canOt
worry
about
the
quality
of
the
writing
as
I
am
writing
it.
This
goes
in
both
directions:
I
have
written
something
believing
it
was
awesome
but
when
I
come
back
to
it
I
donOt
know
what
I
was
thinking,
and
I
have
also
worried
that
my
writing
wasnOt
good
enough
but
then
realized
I
was
on
to
something.
I
have
won
several
writing
awards
over
the
years,
but
IOm
not
sure
how
much
they
have
meant
to
me.
In
high
school
I
won
a
prize
for
a
story
I
submitted,
but
I
think
I
was
more
excited
about
the
cash
prize
than
the
honor
of
the
award
itself.
Writing
and
finding
my
own
personal
joy
in
the
process
is
more
important
than
how
other
people
perceive
the
finished
product.
