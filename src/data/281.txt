Writing
Like
a
WA
It
seems
like
forever
since
I
was
a
Writing
Associate
for
Lafayette
College.
I
think
to
myself,
"Was
I,
ever?"
I
bailed
out
on
the
program
last
semester
because
I
knew
I'd
have
too
much
work
to
do
with
six
classes.
Six
classes
later
--
four
Chemical
Engineering
courses,
a
dumb
Ethics
course,
and
a
great
English
course
--
it
has
been
forever
since
I
even
thought
of
looking
at
another
writer's
paper
and
trying
to
help
them
(them?
I
don't
even
know
what
pronoun
to
use!).
I'm
glad
I
took
a
semester
off
--
if
I
wouldn't
have,
I
would
have
only
hurt
myself
and
not
helped
the
students
that
would
have
been
assigned
to
me
as
much
as
they
would
have
deserved
--
but
now
that
I'll
be
a
part-time
WA,
I'm
happy
to
be
writing
my
third
workshop
essay
for
this
program.
As
a
part-time
member
in
the
program,
the
thought
of
only
being
assigned
to
ten
lab
students
makes
me
feel
good
as
I
get
to
help,
but
without
stringing
myself
out
like
previous
difficult
semesters.
Tell
me,
what
ever
came
of
my
fourteen
pages
(or
so)
written
previously
for
this
workshop?
I'm
sure
now
that
they
were
unintentionally
pompous,
but
I
certainly
didn't
want
to
come
across
as
a
potentially
bad
Writing
Associate
at
the
time.
Hmm....but
at
the
time,
I
suppose
I
needed
to
stand
by
the
things
I
wrote,
and
so
all
the
self-editorializing
converged
to
pompous.
As
for
now,
I
don't
really
plan
on
defending
this
essay
--
at
least
not
too
much.
Feel
free
to
enjoy
it
or
find
it
annoying
to
read,
or
whatever
you
like.
If
it
still
seems
as
if
I'm
editing
my
own
thoughts
as
I
write,
and
if
this
does
not
bode
well
for
you,
then
I
humbly
apologize.
It's
an
accident.
But
wait
--
I
don't
even
know
anymore
--
what
should
I
do?
The
question
remains,
even
though
I've
tried
to
answer
it:
should
I
stand
by
my
pages
even
if
they
are
going
through
a
shredder,
unread?
What
if
I
cut
myself
on
the
shredder
accidentally
while
watching
my
pages
get
cut
into
hundreds
of
depressing
strips?
Will
these
seven
(or
so)
pages
fall
into
full-fledged
obscurity
like
the
last
fourteen?
The
sound
of
shredding
paper
is
heard...
there's
laughing...
all
is
quiet.
Then,
there
I
am
talking
(writing)
again.
If
no
one
ever
reads
this,
then
I
must
speak
my
mind:
I'd
prefer
not
writing
this.
Sorry.
The
reason:
I
don't
want
to
organize
my
past
writing
year;
I
like
its
disorder
in
my
mind.
Also,
I'd
rather
be
writing
something
else,
like
my
thesis
draft
for
the
English
department.
More
generally,
I'd
rather
be
writing
for
myself,
and
so
I
think
that
is
what
I
just
may
do.
I
am
not
sharp
these
days;
there
may
be
grammatical
errors
throughout
this
paper.
I
need
to
work
on
it
before
I
enter
into
any
conferences
with
anyone
in
the
coming
months.
I
suppose
errors
wouldn't
be
good
for
me,
a
returning
WA,
to
be
admitting
right
now,
but
I
cannot
help
but
tell
the
truth.
I'm
rusty.
The
past
year
has
been
a
difficult
one
for
me,
as
I've
had
to
resist
a
natural
tendency
towards
laziness
(I
blame
society)
to
do
a
ridiculous
amount
of
work
for
all
my
classes.
I've
probably
written
down
more
numbers
for
my
calculator
than
letters
for
my
papers,
but
concerning
the
letters,
I've
written
much,
although
this
paragraph
is
not
the
place
to
tell
you
about
them....
...And
as
I
am
writing
this
new
paragraph,
I
realize
you're
not
going
to
hear
about
my
writing
history
in
this
paragraph
either.
Sorry.
Furthermore,
I'm
not
going
to
tell
you
about
the
things
I've
written
in
chronological
order
starting
with
a
year
ago
because
I'd
rather
be
writing
for
myself,
and
if
I
were
writing
for
myself
I
certainly
wouldn't
put
anything
in
order,
as
I
said
above.
There,
I
repeated
myself!
Agonize
over
my
wordiness.
Sorry
if
that
seems
insolent.
Anyway,
I
feel
I
can
present
my
writing
more
interestingly
out
of
order.
Again,
it's
important
for
me
to
stress
a
writer's
independence
to
you
-
as
I
did
implicitly
before
--
if
there
is
a
you
reading
this
--
because
the
only
discovery
I've
made
that
I
feel
I
need
to
tell
you
is
that
in
the
end
you
should
listen
to
yourself
the
most
when
writing,
even
when
it
seems
there
are
things
you
must
do
in
an
assignment
or
in
any
general
body
of
writing.
As
a
writer,
do
what
you
want
to
as
high
an
extent
as
you
wish,
and
don't
rely
entirely
on
what
others
advise
you
with,
or
more
extremely
tell
you
what
your
writing
needs
to
be,
if
they
perchance
make
the
mistake
of
doing
that.
And
as
WA's,
don't
tell
anyone
how
to
do
something.
Only
advise
to
a
certain
point!
It's
their
paper!
Being
in
a
writing
conference
is
just
a
form
of
counseling,
and
not
a
question
/
answer
session.
You're
not
the
Secretary
of
Defense
and
you
don't
have
any
red,
nuclear
phones
--
you're
a
fellow
student
at
a
good
school
with
a
poor
meal
plan.
For
example,
don't
look
to
me
for
any
answers
--
so
what
if
I'm
a
senior
WA
--
if
you
ask
me
outright,
I
could
tell
you
or
anyone
something
that
may
not
work
out!
I
could
be
wrong
-
I
am
well
trained,
hopefully,
for
being
a
WA,
but
not
above
the
laws
of
writing
and
proper
counsel
by
any
means.
In
the
end,
it
is
always
the
writer's
option
to
present
their
writing
in
the
way
they
feel
most
comfortable
presenting.
And
in
college,
it's
their
grade.
Not
yours.
Offer
advice
to
a
writer
and
try
to
be
as
helpful
as
you
can,
but
I
would
say
always
try
to
make
them
realize
that
their
own
writing
choices
provide
the
most
virtue.
By
the
way,
the
stuff
above
hopefully
explains
how
I
have
approached
my
conferences,
especially
the
ones
two
semesters
ago
when
I
was
a
WA
last.
If
it
doesn't,
then
I
suppose
it
wasn't
meant
to
be.
Sorry.
I'm
fairly
certain
my
work
got
a
great
reception
from
all
the
students
I
helped,
so
if
all
of
this
is
wrong
in
anyone's
mind,
then
I
don't
really
know
how
to
respond
other
than
trail
off
in
a
developed
form
of
disinterest.
I
will
use
an
ellipse
at
the
end
of
this
otherwise
pointless
sentence
to
illustrate
this....
Anyway,
to
break
into
some
Holden
Caulfield
style
(only
it
won't
be
very
funny
--
but
don't
worry,
I
love
to
use
the
word
anyway
),
I
think
I've
made
some
major
strides
in
the
past
year
with
my
own
writing.
The
biggest
stride
would
have
to
be
a
greater
ability
to
turn
out
pages
I
am
proud
of.
With
this
has
come
a
greater
volume
of
writing.
My
lab
reports
in
ChE
had
to
be
more
thorough
as
a
second
semester
junior,
and
so
I
accomplished
several
well
written
lab
reports
clocking
in
at
between
30
and
45
pages
last
semester
as
opposed
to
two
semesters
ago
when
I
was
only
capable
of
15-20
pages.
Aside:
too
many
semesters!
Such
dreadfully
large
lab
reports
are
definitely
a
different
writing
process
and
are
actually
maniacally
satisfying
given
the
context
that
I
was
able
to
learn
enough
to
write
most
of
the
content
of
them
from
the
top
of
my
head,
jargon
and
all.
Want
to
know
anything
about
the
effects
of
Non-Newtonian
fluids
on
Brookfield
viscometry?
On
total
reflux
in
Bubble
cap
distillation
columns?
There's
lots
of
interesting
stuff
going
on
there.
Anyway,
some
real
fun
was
had
in
the
English
department
this
past
year
as
I
attended
the
same
professor's
lectures
for
two
different
300
level
classes.
He
(can't
be
specific)
is
a
great
guy,
and
I
loved
reading
the
works
he
put
on
his
book
lists
--
also,
he
enjoyed
my
papers
and
I
enjoyed
writing
them
for
him,
as
I
made
them
really
weird
and
took
many
chances,
and
as
it
turns
out
he
gave
me
two
A's,
and
I
exited
class
always
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
street
as
if
I
were
cradling
golden
eggs
(I
hear
he
doesn't
distribute
A's
often,
so
this
made
me
even
happier).
Run-on!
Anyway,
all
I
can
say
is,
I
love
being
an
English
major
too,
and
I
love
learning
how
to
develop
my
writing.
Run-on!
This
summer
I
edited
poetry
for
a
professor"
in
the
English
department.
This
needs
to
stay
top
secret,
as
any
more
imagery
would
reveal
his"
identity.
His
is
used
arbitrarily
to
hide
the
professor's
gender
as
well
as
her
name
(you
get
the
idea).
This
didn't
provide
me
with
substantial
writing
time,
but
it
did
heighten
my
awareness
of
poetry
to
a
level
previously
not
reached.
My
scope
for
writing
and
literature
has
gotten
broader
and
broader
this
year,
and
so
it's
another
thing
to
be
happy
about.
Anyway,
also
this
summer
I
started
writing
my
thesis.
It's
about
my
experiences
in
Europe
under
the
heading
of
travel
writing,
or
more
generally,
under
creative
nonfiction.
I'm
extremely
happy
to
be
writing
it,
and
its
hopeful
completion
will
be
a
very
crowning
achievement
for
me
as
a
college
student.
Hoping
it
works
out!
Also,
I
want
to
save
my
energy
for
writing
about
my
thesis
for
my
actual
thesis,
so
that's
all
I'm
going
to
tell
you
about
it,
other
than
that
I
am
happy
to
have
fifty
pages
finished
(hey!
that
was
a
little
more
specific!).
Happy!
Probably
the
most
practical
thing
I
did
this
summer
was
write
back
and
forth
with
several
ChE
professors
in
graduate
programs
across
the
country,
in
what
became
the
beginnings
of
my
semi-attempt
to
gauge
my
admission
into
graduate
school.
I
first
wrote
a
cover
letter,
basically
generically
looking
for
more
information
on
this
and
that.
I
also
wrote
about
myself
--
albeit,
it
was
a
very,
very
little
part
of
the
letter
--
just
because
I
wanted
to
avoid
being
entirely
generic.
Anyway,
I
put
quite
a
bit
of
thought,
time,
and
care
into
the
letters;
for
example,
I
used
U.S.
mail
because
I
wanted
these
schools
to
have
me
tangibly
on
file,
instead
of
just
on
someone's
email
in-list.
I
also
personalized
all
of
the
letters
addressing
them
to
the
heads
of
all
the
ChE
departments
I
wrote
to.
I
imagine
your
shock
at
such
a
compulsive,
admittedly
unnecessary
thing
to
do,
but
I
didn't
mention
yet
in
this
essay
that
I
had
to
take
a
Statics
class
this
summer,
and
since
that's
about
as
boring
and
painful
as
watching
a
sloth
come
down
a
tree,
I'm
hoping
you
can
see
why
I
took
such
an
interest
in
writing
cover
letters,
and
making
them
perfect.
Of
course,
there
are
other,
surer
ways
to
procrastinate
which
result
in
more
optimal
health
than
sitting
in
front
of
a
computer
making
a
letter
perfect,
but
personal
choices
provide
the
most
virtue.
Don't
be
a
follower
and
stuff
like
that.
I'm
no
Johnny
Rotten
to
the
main
stream,
but
I'm
certainly
no
Peter
Frampton
to
it!
Hopefully
you
know
what
I
mean.
Sorry.
What
else.
Oh
yeah.
I
took
the
infamous
Engineering
Professionalism
and
Ethics
class
as
a
junior
as
I
was
abroad
when
I
was
set
to
take
it
as
a
sophomore.
Now
that
I
am
a
senior,
all
I
can
say
is,
what
a
terrible
writing
experience.
I
found
it
a
little
disappointing
to
discover
that
a
class
at
Lafayette
College
actually
can
actively
prompt
the
atrophy
of
writing
skills
as
opposed
to
the
growth
of
them.
If
anything
got
me
down
last
semester,
it
was
the
early
morning
disappointments
of
Ethics
class,
and
the
lack
of
feedback
from
the
professor
concerning
assignments
and
especially
papers.
It
was
the
first
time
since
I
was
a
freshman
where
I
had
a
Writing
Associate
to
help
me,
and
he
(secret!)
provided
legions
of
more
help
than
the
professor
did,
which
was
simply
uncanny.
This
is
of
course
not
a
complaint
but
rather
a
disappointment.
For
busier
students
on
this
campus,
sometimes
it
is
not
possible
to
regularly
track
down
professors
in
their
offices
with
questions,
and
this
presents
the
blessing
that
is
feedback
when
professors
grade
exams
and
papers.
I
did
not
receive
it
even
after
asking
--
how
am
I
supposed
to
improve
on
papers
written
in
new
territory
when
I
have
nothing
to
go
on?
I
can
only
hope
that
other
people
didn't
care
as
much
as
I
did
--
that
would
ease
the
overall
pain
of
this
memory.
I
only
cared
because
it
was
fun
to
read
philosophy.
I
miss
the
philosophy
class
I
took
in
high
school.
Anyway.
Earlier
in
this
essay
I
touched
on
previous
WA
experiences;
in
the
past
year,
I
only
served
for
one
of
the
past
two
semesters.
My
experiences
are
not
fresh
in
my
mind,
but
I
do
remember
the
satisfaction
of
being
able
to
help,
in
the
end,
most
of
the
students
I
was
assigned
to.
I
had
a
few
problems
and
wrote
many
a
long
conference
report,
but
I
think
things
went
successfully
overall.
Reading
FYS
papers
on
technology
in
third
world
countries
provided
more
of
a
contrast
from
my
coursework
than
what
I
would
have
wished
for
ideally,
given
my
insane
ChE
work
schedule,
but
I
was
very
happy
to
be
a
part
of
the
program.
It
was
challenging
to
take
on
something
so
different
from
engineering
while
taking
engineering
classes,
but
I
cannot
expand
upon
this
to
more
sentences
on
it
because
I've
been
getting
about
as
diverse
an
education
as
is
possible
here
at
Lafayette
anyway
because
of
my
weird
double
major
and
I
don't
want
to
babble.
On
that
note,
it
seems
like
a
decent
time
to
run
out
of
things
to
say....
On
a
final
note,
it's
been
fun
to
read
back
over
this
and
see
how
much
I
continually
consciously
contradicted
myself.
You
can
find
tons
of
contradictions
and
things
to
be
confused
about!
Moral
one:
drafts
are
the
way
to
go,
but
only
if
you
have
the
time.
It's
sad,
but
some
people
don't
write
drafts
--
I'm
sorry
I
didn't
this
time!
It's
fun
to
pretend
to
be
whimsical.
Moral
two:
if
you're
up
for
it,
follow
your
heart
when
writing.
You
may
not
get
the
best
grade
or
get
praised
at
all
for
anything,
but
I
like
this
method.
Of
course,
as
a
WA
again
this
coming
semester,
I
look
forward
to
offering
more
traditional
forms
of
help
for
writing.
Anyway,
off
I
go
now
to
alleviate
some
footnote
issues;
apparently
289
footnotes
is
too
much
for
a
seven
page
essay,
and
I
was
politely
advised
to
exclude
them
all....
