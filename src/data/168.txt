WA
Summer
Writing
Assignment
8/22/98
Writing
and
language
related
tasks
have
always
been
enjoyable
for
me.
I
have
been
an
avid
reader
since
my
days
in
Mrs.
Aron's
kindergarten
class,
when
I
read
or
was
read
to
every
single
night
before
bed.
By
the
time
I
was
in
first
grade,
I
was
reading
books
on
the
second
and
third
grade
level.
My
boundless
and
vivid
imagination
certainly
developed
as
a
result
of
my
enthusiasm
for
reading.
Once
I
began
learning
how
to
put
these
ideas
down
on
paper,
I
found
my
new
favorite
past
time.
I
began
a
diary,
I
wrote
notes
to
all
of
my
friends
in
class
(which
did
not
seem
to
impress
even
my
English
teachers),
and
every
relative
received
a
Birthday
card
with
their
very
own
poetic
"masterpiece"
in
it.
I
have
been
told
that
I
was
much
more
reserved
when
I
was
younger,
so
I
may
have
enjoyed
writing
so
much
because
it
enabled
me
to
communicate
ideas
that
I
was
too
shy
to
voice.
It
wasn't
until
the
second
and
third
grades
that
I
began
to
learn
about
and
how
to
use
different
types
of
writing.
Mrs.
Scheese
instructed
us
about
the
differences
between
biographical,
suspense,
and
narrative
writing.
I
was
thrilled
to
imagine
how
you
could
write
something
that
could
scare,
amuse,
or
inform
your
reader.
It
was
even
more
exciting
to
begin
using
some
of
the
different
writing
genres.
I
was
especially
proud
of
my
first
research
paper-a
two
page
encyclopedia
report
entitled
"Everything
You
Wanted
to
Know
About
Monarch
Butterflies."
We
spent
over
a
week
in
the
library
searching
for
resources
simple
enough
for
our
young
minds.
For
another
important
project,
every
third
grader
completed
a
page
for
our
class
mystery
book,
which
our
teacher
proudly
displayed
in
the
main
office.
In
part,
I
enjoyed
these
projects
so
much
because
the
commentary
I
received
on
such
grade
school
assignments
was
always
very
positive.
My
teachers
seemed
to
think
I
had
very
strong
language
skills.
This
made
me
proud
of
my
work
and
I
enjoyed
sharing
my
writing
with
my
family.
To
this
day,
I
still
have
many
of
my
old
reports.
The
only
problem
I
repeatedly
encountered
in
Language
Arts
and
English
as
a
child
was
with
my
handwriting.
My
assignments
were
sometimes
too
illegible,
and
had
to
be
rewritten
and
resubmitted
before
my
teachers
would
grade
them.
I
attribute
my
atrocious
scribble
to
the
haste
I
demonstrated
when
writing.
Ideas
were
running
around
so
rapidly
in
my
head
that
I
was
afraid
I
would
lose
them
if
I
took
too
long
to
get
them
out
and
onto
paper.
Fortunately,
handwriting
only
accounted
for
a
small
portion
of
my
Language
Arts
and
English
grades.
Furthermore,
I
was
grateful
for
not
having
to
endure
handwriting
instruction
much
further
than
elementary
school.
Once
it
was
up
to
me
to
correct
my
writing,
I
was
more
careful
when
crossing
my
"t's"
and
dotting
my
"i's
"
Up
until
the
end
of
elementary
school,
the
grading
scale
was
very
simple.
An
"O"
was
awarded
for
outstanding
work,
an
"S"
for
satisfactory,
and
a
"U"
for
unsatisfactory.
In
my
opinion,
there
was
only
one
"bad"
grade-a
"U
"
Once
I
entered
the
fourth
and
fifth
grades,
the
game
changed
quite
a
bit.
The
grading
scale
was
much
larger
and
ranged
from
"A's"
to
"F's."
This
meant
a
much
clearer
difference
was
made
between
"great"
writing,
"good"
writing,
and
"mediocre"
writing.
Previously,
any
piece
of
writing
that
had
some
flaws
could
still
be
considered
"outstanding"
and
an
assignment
that
was
filled
with
flaws,
but
"okay"
was
still
graded
as
"satisfactory."
These
years
and
the
new
grading
criteria
marked
a
gigantic
change
in
my
writing
and
in
how
I
viewed
writing
in
general.
This
change,
unfortunately,
was
not
a
positive
one.
I
became
frustrated
when
I
wrote
because
what
I
considered
to
be
a
"good"
paper
received
"average"
grades.
There
was
pressure
to
write
what
I
thought
would
guarantee
a
good
grade,
instead
of
enjoying
what
I
was
writing
and
being
as
creative
as
possible.
My
teachers
always
told
me
that
my
sentences
were
too
lengthy,
my
paragraphs
too
long,
and
my
structure
too
weak.
This
was
upsetting
and
demeaning,
since
I
could
not
understand
how
to
condense
and
organize
my
writing
while
still
conveying
the
same
ideas.
I
was
also
not
accustom
to
having
such
a
critical
reader
and
with
having
to
write
so
grammatically
correct.
Originality
and
effort
had
never
seemed
so
unimportant
to
my
teachers.
Writing
became
a
chore
and
I
began
to
dread
every
book
report,
short
story,
and
poem
I
was
assigned
to
write.
This
negative
attitude
ruled
the
end
of
my
grade
school
English.
This
writing
"rain
cloud"
looming
over
my
head
was
lifted
once
I
entered
Mrs.
McVeigh's
eighth
grade
Honors
English
class.
It
was
a
very
relaxed
atmosphere,
where
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
brainstorming
and
collaborating
with
peers
to
compose
long,
detailed
stories.
I
learned
how
to
use
literary
tools
such
as
alliteration,
onomatopoeia
and
metaphors
to
spice
up
my
writing,
as
well
as
how
to
structure
my
papers
more
effectively.
Mrs.
McVeigh
was
always
supportive
and
had
a
way
of
being
able
to
edit
your
papers
without
making
you
feel
as
if
all
of
your
grammar
was
incorrect.
English
class
became
exciting
and
rewarding
to
me
once
again
and
my
improved
grades
were
proof
of
this.
My
faith
in
myself
as
a
writer
had
returned!
The
next
three
years
of
High
School
English
flew
by
with
my
love
and
enjoyment
of
writing
restored.
I
learned
to
take
criticism
more
constructively,
utilized
extra
tutorial
for
important
assignments,
and
became
a
better,
more
critical
reader
of
my
own
writing.
The
only
adjustment
I
had
to
make
for
High
School
writing
was
the
more
widespread
use
of
computers
and/or
typewriters.
Until
this
point,
my
work
could
be
handwritten
or
typed.
Since
I
was
comfortable
with
pen
and
paper,
I
usually
chose
the
former
option.
Although
it
took
a
while
to
warm
up
and
get
my
typing
up
to
speed
with
the
ideas
and
phrases
running
rampant
in
my
head,
I
grew
to
love
using
a
word
processor
for
my
writing
assignments.
I
became
a
fanatic
at
revising,
re-revising,
and
changing
around
my
papers
because
what
had
once
been
a
messy,
arduous
task
was
now
extremely
easy.
My
structure
and
organization
improved
dramatically,
and
I
began
producing
my
finest
work
and
some
of
the
best
assignments
my
teachers
had
ever
read.
My
senior
year
proved
to
be
a
huge
dilemma
in
my
writing
history.
I
had
been
in
the
Honors
writing
program
all
throughout
my
elementary,
middle
school,
and
high
school
education.
Senior
English
in
my
High
School
was
only
offered
in
"regular"
and
Advanced
Placement,
which
is
more
accelerated
and
much
more
time-consuming
than
Honors
English.
After
much
debate
and
consideration
of
my
other
responsibilities,
including
my
after
school
job,
I
chose
to
take
"regular"
English.
This
proved
to
be
a
wise
decision
and
one
that
would
introduce
me
to
a
different
aspect
of
the
writing
process,
helping
other
people
write.
Thus
far,
I
had
only
been
concerned
with
my
own
writing
and
I
had
never
had
the
chance
or
time
to
read
what
my
peers
were
writing.
The
"regular"
English
curriculum
was
less
demanding,
making
time
less
of
a
constraint.
We
were
able
to
take
class
periods
for
peer
editing,
and
this
is
where
I
flourished.
I
was
told
I
was
great
at
reading
critically
and
at
giving
others
valuable
and
useful
commentary.
Little
did
I
know
that
I
would
be
able
to
use
this
type
of
reading
and
the
patience
I
had
acquired
for
working
with
others
once
I
entered
college.
By
the
end
of
my
graduate
summer,
I
had
begun
trying
to
prepare
myself
for
the
immeasurable
changes
I
was
about
to
experience.
The
most
crucial,
of
course,
being
the
change
in
the
way
in
which
I
would
learn.
I
had
heard
horror
stories
from
older
friends
who
had
trouble
with
and
hated
their
freshman
year
classes.
People
come
from
all
different
areas
and
backgrounds,
so
I
could
conceivably
be
the
strongest
Biology
student
in
one
class
section
and
the
least
experienced
in
another.
Would
I
be
lost
in
class?
Would
everyone
laugh
when
I
was
the
only
one
to
repeatedly
raise
my
hand
with
questions?
I
was
particularly
nervous
about
college
writing.
Even
though
I
had
spent
years
in
the
Honors
English
program,
I
feared
that
I
had
missed
out
on
something
I
needed
for
college
or
that
I
had
forgotten
too
much
by
not
being
in
an
accelerated
English
class
my
senior
year.
I
imagined
my
FYS
professor,
an
author
of
several
textbooks,
a
critical
reader,
and
an
even
harsher
grader.
It
was
such
a
relief
to
have
ample
time
to
create
several
drafts
and
to
confer
with
an
experienced
writer
before
handing
in
my
first
college
paper.
The
topics
we
covered
and
the
texts
we
read
were
much
more
in
depth
than
anything
I
had
ever
encountered
in
the
past.
This,
of
course,
gave
way
to
lengthier
pieces
of
writing
that
were
much
more
time-consuming
than
anything
I
had
ever
written
before.
After
doing
well
on
my
college
essays,
I
was
especially
proud,
considering
how
much
more
effort,
time,
and
thought
I
had
put
into
each
piece
of
writing
I
completed.
College
writing
has
been
very
enjoyable
thus
far.
Doing
well
on
the
papers
I
submitted
to
my
FYS
professor
showed
me
that
I
was
adequately
prepared
for
college
writing,
or
at
least
as
prepared
as
one
could
be
for
such
an
experience.
Even
though
creative
writing
has
always
been
my
favorite
writing
genre,
I
have
found
the
laboratory
reports
and
research
papers
assigned
in
college
just
as
easy
to
start
as
leisurely
writing.
Starting
a
new
piece
of
work
is
often
the
most
difficult
and
infuriating
part
of
the
writing
process.
I
try
to
overcome
this
is
by
beginning
every
piece
of
writing
with
brainstorming,
or
"blind"
typing
until
I
have
something
acceptable
on
the
computer
screen.
By
treating
every
writing
task
in
exactly
the
same
manner,
I
tend
not
to
spend
less
time
on
or
dread
certain
types
of
writing.
I
think
this
will
help
me
develop
into
a
more
flexible
writer.
Both
satisfaction
and
frustration
have
been
a
part
of
my
writing
history.
I
began
my
writing
career
confident
and
in
love
with
every
aspect
of
the
process,
but
managed
to
stray
from
it
once
I
was
pressured
to
write
a
certain
way.
At
one
time,
I
clearly
felt
requirements
and
specific
grading
scales
were
suffocating
to
my
writing
style.
After
years
of
learning
and
refining
the
skills
and
tools
necessary
to
be
an
effective
writer,
I
finally
feel
comfortable
with
my
writing
abilities.
I
believe,
however,
that
I
have
only
begun
to
successfully
use
the
knowledge
from
years
of
help
and
guidance
from
my
teachers
and
peers.
There
is
a
long
road
of
writing
refinement
in
front
of
me,
but
I
am
confident
that
I
can
rise
to
the
challenge
of
self-improvement,
as
I
have
done
in
the
past.
College
is
certainly
the
right
place
for
me
to
continue
growing
as
a
writer.
With
the
VAST
classes
and
other
writing
intensive
requirements
over
the
next
three
years,
I
anticipate
having
plenty
of
opportunities
to
write.
I
will
strive
to
improve
my
vocabulary
and
to
become
a
more
persuasive
writer.
I
hope
that
being
a
Writing
Associate
will
help
me
realize
how
to
read
more
critically
and
will
introduce
me
to
types
of
writing
and
writers
that
I
am
not
yet
familiar
with.
I
hope
to
eventually
combine
all
of
the
lessons
learned
and
examples
I
have
seen
to
write
a
Thesis.
This
extremely
large
academic
work
is
what
I
consider
to
be
the
ultimate
test
of
my
writing
abilities.
