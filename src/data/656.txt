My
History
as
a
Writer
Writing
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
tools
to
express
oneyus
thoughts.
People
never
realize
to
the
full
extent
what
their
most
inner
feelings
are
until
they
actually
write
it
or
say
it.
Some
people
are
good
orators,
others
are
successful
writers,
and
still
others
are
both.
Unlike
speakers,
writers
record
ideas
that
can
be
transferred
through
time.
That
is
how
writers
can
follow
the
development
of
both
their
style
and
their
ideas
through
time.
When
I
happen
to
reread
papers
and
other
pieces
of
mine,
I
realize
that
the
way
I
think
and
write
as
well
as
the
means
I
use
for
writing,
and
the
purpose
of
my
writing
have
changed
significantly
throughout
the
years.
At
first
I
used
writing
for
solely
personal
reasons,
as
I
was
trying
to
discover
myself.
Then,
when
I
went
to
college
I
started
to
use
writing
as
a
tool
to
get
to
know
the
world.
In
any
event,
writing
has
played
a
major
part
in
my
personal
and
academic
development.
My
passion
for
writing
started
when
I
was
very
little.
Every
night
my
grandmother
used
to
read
fairy
tales
before
I
fell
asleep.
She
would
never
read
the
end,
though,
no
matter
how
much
I
begged
for
it.
She
would
tell
me
that
I
need
to
learn
the
letters
and
get
the
sweetest
piece
myself.
After
going
to
bed,
I
would
imagine
many
different
scenarios
about
how
the
story
would
end.
The
beautiful
and
unknown
world
that
these
fairy
tales
revealed
and
my
grandmotheryus
technique
provoked
my
imagination.
They
inspired
me
and
made
me
eager
to
learn
to
read
and
write
so
that
I
could
become
part
of
this
incredible
world.
When
I
turned
five,
I
had
finally
acquired
those
skills.
It
wasnyut
until
I
was
seven,
however,
when
I
made
my
first
attempts
to
write.
I
had
already
created
so
many
different
stories
in
my
head
that
I
wanted
to
record
them
all.
I
used
a
big
blue
notebook
with
a
boat
on
the
cover
and
a
favorite
red
pen
to
write
around
ten
fairy
tales,
and
I
would
illustrate
every
single
one
of
them
with
related
to
the
topic
drawings.
I
was
really
proud
of
my
creation
and
showed
it
to
my
mother,
my
grandmother
and
my
elementary
school
teacher.
They
all
encouraged
my
diligence
and
enthusiasm.
For
some
reason,
however,
I
lost
interest
in
doing
this,
and
I
stopped,
but
I
kept
the
notebook.
Now
I
find
my
fairy
tales
a
naFu
e
and
amusing
attempt
of
a
7-year-old
child
trying
to
be
wise.
They
serve
as
a
window
for
me
to
see
the
way
I
thought
at
that
age
and
the
problems
that
used
to
bother
me.
My
second
creative
writing
endeavor
was
when
I
was
in
the
3rd
grade.
One
night
I
watched
some
American
movie
about
high
school
students
who
had
a
school
newspaper.
In
my
elementary
school,
however,
there
was
no
such
a
thing.
I
was
wondering
what
it
was
like
to
read
such
a
newspaper
and
what
information
it
contained.
Once
again
my
imagination
was
provoked,
and
I
decided
to
make
my
own
newspaper.
I
didnyut
have
a
computer
at
the
time;
in
fact,
I
couldnyut
work
on
a
computer
at
all,
because
computers
were
expensive
and
unpopular.
However,
my
father
had
an
old
heavy
typewriter
that
he
used
to
write
his
documents.
At
night,
after
he
was
done
with
his
work,
I
would
take
the
typewriter,
and
use
it
to
make
the
newspaper.
It
had
three
different
sections.
In
the
first
one
I
would
mepublishmo
one
of
my
fairy
tales,
in
the
second
one
I
would
write
an
article
about
a
place
in
Bulgaria
that
I
have
been
to.
The
third
one
was
dedicated
to
interesting
facts
that
I
used
to
find
in
my
first
encyclopedia.
The
newspaper
provoked
my
intellectual
curiosity
as
I
read
the
whole
encyclopedia
so
that
I
could
find
those
interesting
facts.
When
I
had
everything
typed
and
ready,
I
would
draw
a
frog
on
the
front
page
because
the
name
of
the
newspaper
was
Froggy.
I
prepared
three
editions,
photocopied
them,
and
gave
them
as
presents
to
my
family.
My
grandmothers
got
so
excited
about
them
that
they
still
keep
the
newspapers.
My
high
school
experience
started
in
the
8th
grade,
because
the
Bulgarian
educational
system
requires
students
to
complete
5
years
of
that
level
of
education.
Students
donyut
choose
their
high
schools
based
on
preference
but
based
on
test
results.
After
students
complete
7th
grade
they
have
to
take
exams
in
Bulgarian
and
math
to
be
placed
in
schools
with
different
levels
of
academic
challenge.
The
exam
in
Bulgarian
consists
of
an
essay
based
on
a
Bulgarian
literary
work.
In
that
essay
students
are
supposed
to
provide
personal
interpretation
of
the
work.
I
got
the
highest
possible
mark
on
it,
and
I
got
into
one
of
the
best
high
schools.
On
the
first
day
of
school
my
Bulgarian
literature
teacher
assigned
us
to
write
a
similar
paper
to
see
the
level
of
writing
of
everyone
of
the
class.
I
felt
confident
in
mine
but
when
she
gave
them
back,
it
turned
out
to
be
my
worst
writing
experience.
I
had
a
very
low
grade
and
a
lot
of
negative
comments.
She
called
me
after
class
to
discuss
the
result,
and
asked
me
what
grade
I
had
on
the
placement
exam.
She
could
hardly
believe
me
when
I
told
her,
because
apparently
she
didnyut
like
my
style
at
all.
At
first
I
felt
frustrated
with
her
remarks,
but
then
I
figured
that
writing
is
very
subjective.
Some
people
might
think
an
essay
is
strong
and
persuasive,
while
others
might
not
like
it
at
all
as
different
people
sometimes
look
for
different
things
in
a
piece
of
writing.
I
realized
it
is
crucial
to
try
and
not
be
subjective
when
reviewing
other
peopleyus
writing
because
the
fact
that
you
donyut
agree
with
what
one
has
written
doesnyut
necessarily
mean
it
is
a
bad
quality
piece.
This
experience
was
very
helpful
to
me
when
I
became
a
debate
coach
and
I
had
to
read
and
correct
other
studentsyu
speeches.
There
are
no
debate
teachers
because
debate
isnyut
very
popular
in
Bulgaria.
That
is
why
NGOs
train
certain
students
to
become
coaches
and
help
make
speech
and
debate
more
popular.
I
went
through
debate
coach
training,
and
afterwards,
I
was
assisting
five
students
with
their
speeches.
They
would
hand
in
a
hand-written
copy
of
their
speech
as
in
Bulgaria
almost
nobody
would
use
computer
for
papers.
I
would
read
it,
jot
down
some
ideas
and
suggestions
for
improvement,
and
then
meet
with
them.
I
would
ask
them
provocative
questions
about
the
arguments
I
believed
were
poorly
defended.
Eventually
our
meetings
would
end
up
being
meaningful
and
rewarding
discussions
of
the
topic.
I
made
sure
that
I
involve
as
much
communication
as
possible
when
we
were
discussing
the
papers.
My
classmates
have
shared
with
me
that
they
found
it
very
useful
to
discuss
their
work,
and
hear
the
perspective
of
someone
else.
I,
personally,
always
felt
very
satisfied
with
the
final
draft
they
presented
to
me.
The
fact
that
they
once
won
the
city
tournament,
and
finished
second
in
the
national
tournament,
proved
to
me
that
my
approach
has
been
successful.
Another
memorable
writing
experience
was
preparing
for
the
SAT
writing
test
which
also
influenced
my
writing
a
lot.
Before
I
started
to
prepare
myself
for
the
exam,
I
was
always
taking
a
lot
of
time
to
write
a
paper.
In
general,
I
consider
myself
to
be
a
slow
writer
and
I
always
spend
a
long
time
thinking
the
essay
or
the
paper
over.
For
the
SAT,
however,
I
had
to
learn
to
come
up
with
ideas
and
arguments
very
quickly.
I
mastered
the
use
of
brainstorming
as
a
part
of
the
process,
and
I
learnt
to
think,
and
most
importantly,
write
more
quickly.
At
first
it
was
difficult
for
me.
I
would
set
an
alarm
to
ring
in
one
hour
and
I
would
try
to
complete
the
essay
in
that
time
period.
My
English
teacher
would
comment
on
it,
and
then
I
will
try
again
writing
another
one.
In
the
beginning
I
could
barely
finish
at
the
end
of
the
first
hour
and
my
teacheryus
comments
indicated
I
needed
to
work
much
harder
to
succeed.
I
was
persistent
and
after
I
mastered
the
1
hour
essay
I
changed
the
time
to
45
minutes.
The
same
scenario
happened
again.
Eventually,
however,
I
managed
to
train
my
brain
to
be
able
to
work
under
the
pressure
of
time.
A
striking
experience
of
mine
was
when
I
was
writing
essays
for
my
college
applications.
I
realized
how
important
for
me
this
task
was
and
I
wanted
to
do
my
best.
I
wanted
to
make
my
essay
unique
and
impressive.
I
figured
that
brainstorming
by
itself
wouldnyut
be
enough
as
I
was
looking
for
a
deeper
and
more
meaningful
idea.
I
would
go
for
very
long
walks
at
night
around
my
city
thinking
over
ideas.
It
took
me
3
weeks
to
write
two
of
my
essays.
Because
I
couldnyut
submit
them
handwritten,
I
had
to
type
them
on
my
computer.
The
essays
I
was
so
proud
of
at
the
time
now
seem
mediocre
to
me.
At
the
time
I
only
showed
the
essays
to
my
English
teacher.
She
helped
me
a
lot
to
improve
them
and
she
seemed
to
be
satisfied
with
the
end
result.
I
still
have
the
files.
I
reread
them
recently,
and
I
could
notice
how
much
my
style
has
changed
for
the
two
years
that
I
have
been
in
college.
College
has
definitely
helped
me
a
lot
to
develop
my
style
of
writing.
However,
my
first
writing
experience
at
Lafayette
was
rather
stressful.
I
had
never
written
a
research
paper
prior
to
my
arrival
at
the
college.
Classes
had
just
started
when
I
got
my
first
writing
assignment
for
a
politics
class.
We
had
barely
covered
any
material
in
our
FYS
class
as
it
was
only
the
first
week.
I
had
never
written
a
paper
longer
than
3
pages
for
school,
while
that
paper
was
supposed
to
be
5
pages.
I
still
didnyut
know
what
resources
I
could
use
for
my
research
and
I
as
completely
lost
and
scared.
Fortunately,
I
figured
a
guy
that
I
knew
had
taken
the
class,
and
he
was
happy
to
help
me.
He
gave
me
a
lot
of
useful
tips
on
how
to
structure
the
paper
and
do
the
research.
Despite
his
help,
I
still
found
it
very
difficult
to
write
it
because
I
didnyut
know
what
the
expectations
of
the
professor
were
and
whether
I
was
on
the
right
track
when
it
comes
to
style
of
writing.
It
took
me
12
hours
to
write
my
draft.
I
was
staring
at
the
computer,
thinking
over
every
single
sentence
as
I
was
writing
it.
The
next
day
I
decided
not
to
even
think
about
the
paper,
so
that
I
could
clear
my
mind
and
generate
some
fresh
ideas.
The
following
day
I
decided
to
reread
it
and
correct
it.
I
was
surprised
with
what
I
had
written.
I
did
some
major
changes
in
the
structure
of
the
thesis
statement,
and
did
grammar
check.
I
submitted
the
paper
on
time
and
was
eager
to
see
the
result
of
my
hard
work.
When
the
professor
returned
the
paper,
I
read
the
comments
and
was
very
satisfied
with
myself.
The
professor
had
given
me
?
and
had
no
major
remarks.
That
experience
gave
me
confidence
when
it
comes
to
writing
in
English,
and
I
never
felt
uncomfortable
when
I
was
writing
papers
for
that
class.
My
freshman
year
at
college
was
crucial
for
the
development
of
my
writing
skills.
The
FYS
class
I
took
contributed
a
lot.
As
my
professor
was
really
demanding,
I
learned
how
to
live
up
to
high
expectations
with
my
writing.
After
the
first
successful
paper
I
wrote
for
my
politics
class,
I
felt
comfortable
with
my
writing,
and
I
believed
I
shouldnyut
have
had
any
problems
with
my
FYS
class.
When
the
professor
assigned
the
first
paper,
I
was
very
inspired
and
eager
to
write
it.
I
was
doing
the
research
in
depth
and
with
a
lot
of
interest.
I
spent
a
long
time
thinking
over
my
thesis
statement,
my
arguments,
etc.
Then
I
sat
down
and
wrote
it
in
one
breath.
Afterwards
I
was
revising
it
for
a
couple
of
days,
and
submitted
it.
The
professor
required
us
to
submit
the
papers
online
and
he
would
return
them
with
his
comments
but
no
grade.
When
I
got
the
paper
back,
I
was
shocked.
I
opened
the
word
document
and
saw
many
comments
suggesting
major
changes
of
the
paper.
In
addition,
the
professor
wasnyut
very
pleased
with
my
research
that
I
was
so
proud
of.
This
experience
didnyut
discourage
me
though.
On
the
contrary,
I
was
determined
to
improve
and
live
up
to
his
expectations.
With
every
paper
that
I
wrote
for
that
class,
his
comments
were
changing
in
nature
as
in
there
were
no
more
comments
about
the
thesis
statement
or
the
structure
of
the
paper.
Every
paper
with
so
much
critique
made
even
more
determined
to
write
better
and
better.
In
the
end
of
the
semester,
the
professor
sent
me
an
e-mail
with
evaluation
of
my
writing
portfolio
for
his
class.
I
had
never
felt
so
satisfied
with
my
work
than
when
I
read
his
comments.
The
professor
said
that
despite
the
weak
beginning
of
the
semester,
my
writing
has
improved
immensely.
He
appreciated
my
hard
work
and
determination.
The
VAST
I
took
my
sophomore
year
helped
me
develop
my
writing
as
well.
My
professor
was
assigning
papers
on
very
similar
topics,
and
at
times
I
felt
frustrated
because
the
sources
I
found
always
seemed
to
be
the
same,
and
I
was
running
out
of
ideas.
One
meeting
with
my
WA,
however,
helped
me
come
up
with
better
ideas.
I
shared
with
my
W?
how
I
feel
about
the
paper,
and
as
she
had
taken
the
class
she
gave
me
some
advice
on
were
to
look
for
more
information
on
that
topic.
She
also
asked
me
many
questions
that
provoked
me
to
think
about
the
topic
from
a
different
perspective.
She
also
explained
to
me
that
these
papers
donyut
expect
students
to
be
coming
up
with
something
new
each
time;
their
purpose
was
to
make
us
defend
our
arguments
sufficiently.
That
experience
proved
to
me
once
again
how
important
it
is
to
discuss
your
work
with
other
people.
Writing
plays
a
major
part
in
peopleyus
lives
as
it
is
a
powerful
way
of
communication
that
allows
thoughts,
ideas
and
fact
to
be
transferred
through
time.
That
is
why
mastering
this
skill
is
crucial
to
personal
development.
Nobody
was
born
knowing
how
to
write
and
express
themselves.
Acquiring
this
skill
is
an
ever-lasting
and
rewarding
process
that
every
educated
individual
goes
through.
