Chronicles
of
a
Writer
Several
years
ago
my
mother
had
surprisingly
managed
to
convince
my
sister
and
I
to
clean
the
basement.
While
rummaging
through
what
seemed
an
endless
stack
of
brown
cardboard
boxes,
I
came
across
a
box
that
had
Angela's
Books
scribbled
in
black
marker
across
the
top
right
of
its
four
corner
flaps.
Among
the
stacks
of
Amelia
Bedelia,
Berenstain
Bears,
and
Pippy
Longstocking
books,
I
picked
up
a
plain
yet
familiar
looking
manila
hardback
book.
As
I
opened
E.B.
White's
Trumpet
of
the
Swan,
the
book's
binding
let
out
a
little
squeak
similar
to
the
creaking
sound
wooden
stairs
make
in
an
old
farmhouse.
The
structured
black
print
across
the
once
white
pages,
now
turned
eggshell
by
age,
had
been
disrupted
by
the
shaky
handwriting
of
a
child
just
learning
to
write.
It
took
me
a
few
seconds
to
recognize
that
the
exceedingly
large
skinny
charcoal
letters
were
all
documented
attempts
of
me
trying
to
write
my
name.
I
would
not
realize
the
significance
of
this
discovery
until
many
years
later.
In
fact,
I
would
not
understand
the
meanings
behind
those
large
awkward
letters
until
my
freshman
year
of
college
when
I
received
an
assignment
in
my
first
year
writing
course
requiring
me
to
recount
my
formative
reading
experiences.
It
is
clear
to
me
now
that
at
that
early
age
I
had
already
learned
the
potency
of
the
written
word.
Writing
my
name
throughout
E.B.
White's
Trumpet
of
the
Swan
was
not
solely
an
act
of
childhood
mischief;
it
was
also
an
eager
attempt
to
demonstrate
my
ability
to
write.
Since
my
earliest
experiences
as
a
writer
I
have
changed
tremendously
Not
only
has
my
handwriting
improved,
but
my
identity
as
a
writer
has
undergone
many
gradual
changes
and
several
growth
spurts.
In
the
St.
Martin's
Handbook
Lunsford
and
Connors
reveal
their
belief
that,
"reading
is
closely
related
to
writing..."
(9).
Through
my
own
gradual
growth
as
a
writer
I
have
experienced
the
unique
relationship
reading
and
writing
share.
Every
inch
I
grow
as
a
writer
is
nourished
by
my
reading
experiences.
However,
as
much
credit
as
reading
has
rightfully
taken
for
my
growth
as
a
writer,
it
is
not
solely
responsible.
My
growth
spurts
as
a
writer
were
in
some
cases
caused
by
a
single
assignment,
through
the
guidance
of
a
teacher,
or
a
particular
course.
I
experienced
my
first
major
growing
pain
during
the
fifth
grade.
My
memories
of
fifth
grade
language
arts
sessions
are
not
vivid;
however,
I
do
remember
one
particular
writing
assignment
in
which
we
were
asked
to
write-out
instructions
on
how
to
make
a
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwich.
For
this
assignment
our
intended
audience
was
a
Martian
from
outer
space
who
wanted
to
Learn
how
to
make
a
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwich.
He
would
use
these
instructions
to
teach
other
Martians
the
art
of
making
a
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwich.
After
Mrs.
Defoire,
our
fifth
grade
teacher,
finished
explaining
the
assignment
the
class
took
a
few
seconds
to
exchange
glances
of
confusion
before
beginning
to
write.
Within
five
minutes
the
entire
class
had
finished
writing.
Without
even
a
suggestion
of
astonishment
towards
our
rapid
completion
Mrs.
Defoire
instructed
the
class
to
pass
our
papers
forward,
clear
off
our
desks,
and
prepare
for
lunch
and
recess.
The
following
day
Mrs.
Defoire
redistributed
our
writing
assignments.
Upon
discovery
that
the
assignments
were
not
graded
the
class
exchanged
glances
of
confusion
for
a
second
time.
Twenty-eight
pairs
of
eyes
turned
and
planted
themselves
on
Mrs.
Defoire
seeking
an
explanation.
Ignoring
the
murmur
of
confusion
Mrs.
Defoire
pulled
a
medium
sized
brown
paper
bag
out
from
under
her
desk.
She
reached
into
the
brown
paper
bag
and
lifted
out
ajar
of
Jiffy
peanut
butter,
ajar
of
Welches
grape
jelly,
a
loaf
of
wonder
bread,
a
plastic
knife,
and
a
stack
of
napkins.
She
placed
the
contents
of
the
bag
on
a
desk
that
was
situated
at
the
front
of
the
classroom.
Mrs.
Defoire
proceeded
to
the
back
of
the
classroom,
pulled
a
chair
out
from
under
a
desk,
sat
down,
and
set
her
green
attendance
book
on
top
of
the
desk.
Finally
she
announced
that
we
had
five
minutes
to
revise
our
peanut
butter
and
jelly
writing
assignments.
Satisfied
with
our
assignments,
most
of
the
class
sat
quietly
for
the
next
five
minutes
twiddling
with
our
pencils
or
doodling
within
the
margins
of
our
loose-leaf
notebook
paper.
When
the
five
minutes
had
passed
Mrs.
Defoire
called
out
the
first
name
on
the
attendance
list.
She
asked
the
student
to
hand
in
the
final
copy
of
his
assignment.
She
then
told
him
to
go
to
the
front
of
the
classroom
and
stand
behind
the
desk
that
displayed
the
arrangement
of
peanut
butter
and
jelly
ingredients.
He
betrayed
his
nervousness
as
he
stood
behind
the
desk
shifting
his
weight
from
his
right
foot
to
his
left
foot.
He
directed
his
eyes
toward
Mrs.
Defoire
waiting
for
further
instructions.
She
revealed
that
he
was
to
follow
word
for
word
as
she
read
the
instructions
he
had
hastily
written
the
previous
day.
She
began,
"
Put
some
peanut
butter
on
a
slice
of
bread."
The
student
began
untwisting
the
twist
tie
that
was
wrapped
around
the
front
end
of
the
loaf
of
bread
when
Mrs.
Defoire
quickly
interrupted
him,
"Excuse
me,
but
your
instructions
do
not
direct
you
to
untwist
the
twist
tie."
The
student
paused
for
a
moment
then
furrowed
his
eyebrows,
lifted
both
of
his
hands,
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
protest,
and
responded,
"Well,
I
have
to
untwist
it
in
order
to
take
out
a
slice
of
bread."
Mrs.
Defoire
smiled
and
replied,
"Then
you
should
have
included
that
step
in
your
instructions...
let's
see
if
the
next
student's
instructions
are
more
complete."
Every
student
took
his
or
her
turn
in
front
of
the
class
as
Mrs.
Defoire
read
aloud
each
student's
written
instructions.
Within
a
couple
of
seconds
each
student
returned
to
his
or
her
seat
empty-handed.
Once
every
student
had
attempted
to
make
a
peanut
butter
jelly
sandwich
it
was
evident
that
the
goal
of
this
exaggerated
writing
exercise
was
to
teach
us
the
vitality
of
detailed
writing.
My
fifth
grade
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwich
writing
assignment
successfully
molded
me
into
a
detailed
writer,
in
fact
at
times
my
writing
is
a
little
too
thorough.
When
given
a
writing
assignment
I
hardly
ever
worry
about
length
requirement.
While
most
of
my
classmates
are
grunting
and
moaning
about
how
long
the
assignment
has
to
be
or
devising
ways
to
make
his
or
her
paper
meet
the
minimum
page
requirement
by
enlarging
the
font
or
narrowing
the
margins,
I
am
usually
wrestling
with
the
strains
of
down
sizing.
The
next
writing
experience
that
impacted
me
as
a
writer
was
not
until
my
second
year
of
high
school.
When
I
opened
my
schedule
the
August
previous
to
my
sophomore
year
I
was
devastated
to
find
that
my
sophomore
English
teacher
would
he
Mr.
Tufano.
He
had
an
array
of
wild
black
hair
that
had
never
been
introduced
to
a
comb
or
brush.
Every
time
he
spoke
his
lisp
induced
a
non-rhythmic
chorus
of
hissing,
sounds
to
sputter
from
his
mouth.
To
top
it
off
Mr.
Tufano
had
a
notorious
reputation
for
being
"tightfisted"
when
it
came
to
distributing
any
mark
above
a
C
plus.
Surprisingly,
within
a
couple
weeks
of
being
in
Mr.
Tufano's
third
period
honors
English
class,
all
of
the
rumors
and
preconceptions
that
had
bombarded
me
before
I
entered
his
classroom
began
to
fade
away,
allowing
such
classics
as
Othello,
Hamlet,
and
Henry
VIII
to
take
stage.
His
eclectic
curriculum
including
John
Steinbeck's
Grapes
of
Wrath
and
Herman
Hesse's
Siddhartha,
catapulted
me
from
the
struggle
of
the
North
American
movement
westward
to
a
religious
journey
to
discover
Atman
(Self)
in
the
Far
East.
Mr.
Tufano
paired
each
major
reading,
assignment
with
a
writing
composition.
Previously,
I
had
completed
several
stacks
of
the
generic
two-page
book
reports
and
I
had
written
an
occasional
essay
during
freshman
English,
but
I
had
never
been
required
to
write
a
composition.
These
composition
assignments
allowed
me
to
begin
building
my
writing
character
and
broadened
my
perspectives
concerning
the
profits
gained
through
writing.
I
learned
that
writing
assignments
are
not
merely
a
tool
teachers
use
to
measure
whether
a
student
completed
and
comprehended
the
reading
material.
I
discovered
that
my
understanding
of
the
reading
material
increased
significantly
with
the
completion
of
a
corresponding
writing
assignment.
Every
time
we
received
a
composition
assignment
I
turned
the
key
that
started
my
brain's
ignition,
pushed
in
the
clutch,
and
shifted
into
gear.
Throughout
the
week
my
focus
was
to
develop
my
thesis.
Every
time
an
idea
came
to
mind
I
would
write
it
down
immediately,
by
the
end
of
the
week
I
would
have
a
scattered
collection
of
thesis
notes.
The
following
weekend
I
would
gather
the
assigned
book
or
play,
my
dictionary,
my
thesis
notes,
a
pencil,
and
my
thesaurus.
I
would
commit
my
self
to
the
computer
room,
sit
myself
in
front
of
our
IBM
PC,
and
begin
typing
my
thesis.
Once
my
thesis
was
perfected
I
would
then
begin
leafing
through
the
reading
material,
marking
with
pencil
the
passages
that
supported
my
thesis.
Using
these
passages
I
would
begin
typing
until
the
body
of
my
composition
was
finished.
Mentally
exhausted
I
would
emerge
from
the
computer
room
allowing
myself
a
few
days
of
rejuvenation
before
tackling
my
conclusion.
For
the
most
part
I
still
abide
by
the
writing
patterns
I
set
my
sophomore
year.
When
I
type
a
paper
I
continuously
back
track,
read,
pause,
reread,
and
revise
every
sentence
much
in
the
same
way
an
artist
steps
back
from
his
or
her
masterpiece
every
few
strokes.
My
writing
style
relies
heavily
on
the
benefits
of
a
word
processor,
making
the
idea
of
a
pen
and
paper
nauseating.
When
I
am
writing
the
only
music
that
can
be
hear
d
from
my
room
is
the
monotonous
clang
of
my
fingertips
against
the
keyboard
keys.
Whenever
possible
I
schedule
a
whole
day
for
writing
a
paper,
but
due
to
the
hectic
demands
of
college
life
I
learned
to
work
on
writing
assignments
between
classes
or
whenever
I
come
upon
five
minutes.
Several
times
I
have
had
to
combat
more
than
one
paper
at
a
time
hurdling
me
back
and
forth,
like
a
ping
pong
ball,
between
assignments.
During
my
junior
year
of
high,
school
I
took
a
poetry/creative
writing,
class.
Mrs.
Paslawsky,
my
creative
writing
teacher,
taught
me
how
to
read
poetry,
a
form
of
writing
that
prior
to
this
class
I
had
intentionally
ignored.
I
learned
that
in
order
to
solve
the
riddles
of
poetry
one
must
equip
him
or
her
self
with
a
pencil
and
a
dictionary.
The
dictionary
is
used
to
look
up
foreign
words
and
those
simple
everyday
words
that
also
have
a
seldom-used
archaic
meaning.
The
pencil
is
used
to
scribble
down
all
of
the
translations
and
notes
that
quickly
accumulate
between
each
stanza.
The
repealed
analysis
of
poetry
breathed
life
into
my
own
writing
revealing
to
me
the
significance
of
such
entities
as
word
choice,
syntax,
tone,
imagery,
et.
Before
this
class
I
had
been
brainwashed
into
the
infamous
five-paragraph
essay
format
consisting
of
an
introduction,
three-paragraph
body,
and
the
conclusion.
Mrs.
Paslawsky
encouraged
her
students
to
take
chances
with
writing
and
taught
us
how
to
incorporate
figurative
language
into
our
writing.
I
became,
and
remain,
a
loyal
student
of
personification,
metaphors,
hyperbolas,
and
similes.
My
expectations
of
freshman
writing
were
frightening
I
thought
that
simply
because
I
was
in
college
I
was
expected
to
write
like
the
next
Toni
Morrison.
Relief
set
in
as
I
realized
that
I
had
acquired
the
writing
skills
necessary
to
succeed
in
my
first
year
seminar
and
first
year
writing
courses.
Although
I
was
prepared
I
was
still
able
to
grow
as
a
writer.
My
first
year
seminar
and
writing
courses
taught
me
the
effectiveness
of
note
taking
not
only
during
class,
but
also
while
reading
a
text.
I
resorted
back
to
my
early
habits
of
writing
through
out
my
books,
but
now
I
scribble
notes
along
the
margins
instead
of
writing
my
name
across
the
pages.
My
new
habits
as
a
note
taker
cut
down
on
research
time
spent
leafing
through
a
text
in
search
of
supporting
evidence
for
a
paper.
Now
I
devote
more
time
towards
drafting,
revising,
and
editing.
By
the
time
I
finish
writing
a
paper
I
have
two
or
three
preliminary
drafts.
In
college,
writing
does
not
only
exist
in
my
English
classes.
Writing
is
an
essential
aspect
of
all
of
my
classes.
Before
college
I
had
never
brushed
shoulders
with
technical
styles
of
writing
that
was
necessary
for
my
biology
and
psychology
courses.
I
had
to
learn
a
completely
different
style
of
writing.
Instead
of
a
creative
writer
I
had
to
take
on
the
role
as
a
reporter,
merely
reporting
the
facts.
This
type
of
lifeless
writing
did
not
initially
appeal
to
me,
until
I
realized
its
significance.
Writing
a
lab
report
serves
as
a
means
of
communicating
information
whereas
writing
a
composition
or
any
type
of
creative
writing
is
not
only
a
means
of
communication
but
also
can
result
in
self-enlightenment
or
a
greater
understanding
of
the
experience
of
others.
Once
I
realized
the
differences
between
the
two
forms
of
writing,
writing
lab
reports
became
a
lot
easier.
During
my
first
semester
of
college
I
also
learned
that
writing
can
begin
as
an
emotional
struggle
that
transforms
into
a
gratifying
experience.
For
my
second
assignment
in
my
first
year
seminar
we
were
assigned
to
write
a
composition
about
Jane
Lazzare's
Beyond
the
Whiteness
of
Whiteness,
a
novel
that
depicts
her
experiences
as
a
white
mother
of
black
children
in
America.
Being
a
child
of
a
white
mother
and
a
black
father
this
assignment
was
emotionally
exhausting
for
me.
The
assignment
was
not
merely
one
of
many
writing
assignments
that
I
would
receive
in
college.
It
was
a
journey
of
self-introspection
in
which
I
was
not
prepared.
I
struggled
through
out
the
entire
process
of
writing
that
emotionally
charged
paper,
but
I
learned
more
about
myself,
my
mother,
and
the
experiences
that
have
inevitably
shaped
our
mother-
daughter
relationship.
This
writing
assignment
gave
me
a
new
appreciation
of
the
love
hate
relationship
I
maintain
with
writing.
I
have
come
a
long
way
since
I
first
began
writing
my
name
throughout
E.B.
White's
Trumpet
of
the
Swan.
I
would
not
call
myself
an
expert
in
writing
however,
reflecting
on
my
past
writing
experiences
has
revealed
several
truths.
I
realize
that
writing
shares
an
undeniable
bond
with
reading.
As
a
person
develops
into
a
better
reader
their
writing
inevitably
improves.
I
have
also
discovered
that
learning
to
write
is
a
never-ending
process
that
demands
practice.
Furthermore,
writing
is
not
an
effortless
activity.
It
is
difficult
to
translate
one's
thoughts
and
feelings
into
words,
much
less
commit
them
to
paper.
Once
on
paper,
thoughts
and
feelings
are
externalized
and,
to
a
certain
degree,
they
no
longer
remain
private.
However,
ironically
writing
can
he
a
personal
experience.
Writing
is
reflective;
it
is
like
painting
a
self-portrait
or
looking
at
one's
reflection
in
a
mirror.
Each
writing
experience
is
like
a
journey
of
self-discovery.
As
I
grow
and
change
my
writing
personality
will
change
as
a
chameleon
changes
from
a
brilliant
red
that
fades
into
a
deep
blue
and
suddenly
brightens
into
a
vibrant
yellow.
