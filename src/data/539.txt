I
Write
Several
pivotal
moments
in
my
twenty-one
years
of
life
mark
my
evolution
as
a
writer.
I'll
start
with
what
is
perhaps
my
clearest
memory
of
my
childhood:
my
first
attempt
to
write
a
story.
Prior
to
the
fourth
grade,
the
only
major
prolific
works
of
writing
I
produced
consisted
of
a
book
report
on
prairie
dogs,
a
poem
about
my
father
mowing
the
lawn
and
endless
copy
books
filled
with
the
ABCs,
cursive
and
whatever
other
miscellaneous
material
they
teach
you
in
elementary
school.
But
in
the
fourth
grade
we
were
given
the
challenge
of
writing
our
own
short
story.
The
requirements
were
standard:
setting,
plot,
characters,
dilemma,
resolution,
the
end.
Our
finished
piece
would
be
typed,
set
to
our
own
illustrations
and
bound
in
hard
cover.
I
was
ecstatic,
and
within
one
day
I
had
a
title,
NThe
Subway
Mystery,O
and
a
protagonist,
Susan
Scufflebottom.
Seriously.
Susan
was
a
girl
in
my
class
whose
hair
I
admired
and
Mrs.
Scufflebottom
was
my
eighty-five
year
old
neighbor.
The
plot
I've
long
forgotten,
but
to
hold
the
hardcover
copy
in
my
hands
was
exhilarating
enough
to
catapult
me
into
a
future
filled
with
an
ever-present
urge
to
write.
Analytical
writing
was
something
I
grew
into;
classes
like
NLanguage
ArtsO
in
fifth
grade
and
later,
English
in
middle
and
high
school
taught
me
how
to
construct
writing
that
felt
sophisticated
and
meaningful.
English
was
always
my
favorite
subject,
partly
because
I
was
blessed
with
a
string
of
excellent
teachers,
but
mostly
because
the
subject
seemed
to
fit
my
personality
so
comfortably.
I
absolutely
loved
my
high
school
curriculum's
book
selection;
we
read
everything
from
the
likes
of
Hawthorne,
Toni
Morrison
and
Shakespeare,
to
in
my
young
opinion,
exotic
selections
like
Jonathan
Safran
Foer
and
Jhumpa
Lahiri.
Whether
it
was
required
or
not,
when
we'd
read
a
book
in
class,
I'd
take
it
and
perform
a
ritual
close
reading
on
each
chapter,
a
character
analysis
of
each
character,
a
timeline
of
the
book's
major
events
and
a
list
of
all
important
themes
that
arose.
My
books
would
leave
the
classroom
resembling
graffiti
art
rather
than
actual
literature,
but
I
found
this
process
helpful.
To
this
day
I
can
recall
seriously
obscure
details
from
some
of
my
ninth
grade
reading.
My
textual
notes
also
proved
useful
when
it
came
time
to
write
a
paper.
To
me,
there
was
nothing
more
thrilling
than
extrapolating
text
to
use
in
a
block
quote,
tracing
a
character's
personal
development
from
chapter
to
chapter,
or
forming
an
argument
to
defend
and
disprove.
Who's
to
blame:
Macbeth
or
Lady
Macbeth?
Should
Sethe
really
be
held
accountable
for
the
murder
of
her
children
in
Morrison's
Beloved?
Yes
and
no.
I
love
to
debate
and
doing
so
in
writing
is
an
energizing,
constructive
experience.
I
watched
as
my
writing
grew
from
a
simple
paragraph
response
to
an
assigned
question,
to
more
of
a
reference
that
reflected
the
content
of
a
certain
novel
and
my
personal
opinions
combined.
I
learned
that
writing
was
not
a
stringent
five-paragraph
essay,
but
a
more
malleable,
experimental
work.
Analytical
writing
has
remained
a
genre
that
I
have
a
friendly
relationship
with.
Creative
writing
and
I
have
a
more
ambivalent,
passionate
relationship
that
has
grown
considerably
since
my
first
year
at
Lafayette.
It
has
become
a
true
ambition.
Poetry,
fiction,
plays,
vignettes,
the
short
story-
each
form
I
have
experimented
with
from
a
young
age.
When
I
was
ten
years
old,
my
great-grandmother
passed
away.
An
artist
at
heart,
she
was
one
of
the
more
fascinating
people
IOve
known
to
date.
In
her
lifetime
she
survived
the
Depression,
anchored
her
own
radio
show
and
at
the
age
of
twenty
had
her
appendix
removed
without
anesthesia.
She
taught
me
how
to
knit
and
introduced
me
to
the
tomato
(a
fruit
I
always
feared,)
but
her
greatest
lesson
was
taught
posthumously:
always
keep
a
journal.
I
had
never
known
she
kept
one,
but
when
she
died,
my
mother,
whom
she
was
very
close
with,
inherited
four
of
her
diaries.
Their
contents
consist
of
stories
upon
stories:
years
during
the
war,
debutante
parties,
deaths,
ghosts,
secrets.
I
watched
my
mother
pour
over
them,
laughing
or
gasping
in
horror,
and
from
then
on
decided
to
keep
a
diary.
I
now
have
dozens,
each
filled
with
short
stories,
poetry,
personal
anecdotes
and
who
knows
what
else.
Not
only
is
it
therapeutic,
but
it
has
become
a
daily
discipline.
A
few
years
ago,
I
stumbled
upon
something
very
poignant
writer
Susan
Sontag
once
said:
NSuperficial
to
understand
the
journal
as
just
a
receptacle
for
one's
private
secret
thoughts...
it
is
a
vehicle
for
my
sense
of
selfhood.
It
represents
me
as
emotionally
and
spiritually
independent.O
For
me,
writing
everyday
is
like
exercising.
G-Mom
taught
me
that
writing
preserves
experience
and
I
firmly
believe
that
no
greater
form
of
self-expression
exists.
Another
inspiration
to
write
creatively
has
come
from
my
father,
who
published
a
children's
book
a
few
years
ago,
Through
his
experience,
I
learned
how
taxing
the
revision
process
is
(his
Editor
once
sent
back
his
manuscript
with
over
2,000
changes,)
and
a
lot
about
publishing,
promoting
and
selling
as
well.
He
turned
a
bedtime
story
he
used
to
tell
my
sister
and
I
into
a
work
of
written
fiction,
and
I
have
always
cherished
the
simplicity
of
it;
he
had
an
idea
and
he
wrote
it
down.
Other
significant
moments
in
my
pre-collegiate
writing
career
include
winning
the
Philadelphia
Young
Playwrights
competition,
being
published
in
and
assisting
the
editing
of
my
school's
literary
magazine
and
writing
my
high
school
commencement
speech.
I
left
the
safe
confines
of
my
high
school
with
trepidation,
but
I
did
feel
well
equipped
to
tackle
the
college
writing
scene.
I
enjoyed
writing
and
even
preferred
it
to
many
other
things,
so
I
knew
I
at
least
had
the
enthusiasm
to
motivate
me.
I
also
felt
that
I
had
the
experience
to
begin
more
serious
writing.
When
speaking
to
a
friend
of
mine
who
had
just
finished
her
freshman
year,
she
said,
Ndon't
worry,
you'll
be
fine.
Some
kids
in
my
writing
class
didn't
even
know
what
a
thesis
statement
is.O
Hadn't
heard
of
a
TS?
I
was
appalled.
As
a
writing
associate
in
high
school,
the
list
of
essay
must-haves
was
ingrained
in
every
fiber
of
my
being.
I
didn't
believe
her.
However,
I
did
in
fact
meet
someone
in
my
First
Year
Seminar
who
thought
a
thesis
statement
was
the
concluding
line
of
an
essay.
In
my
opinion,
this
person
was
not
Nadequately
preparedO
to
enter
the
realm
of
collegiate
writing.
To
possess
the
title,
I
think
someone
needs
to
have
a
set
of
tools
ready
to
properly
craft
a
paper.
They
are:
1.)
knowledge
of
and
the
ability
to
execute
mechanisms
such
as
a
thesis
statement,
an
outline,
topic
sentences,
an
introduction,
body
paragraphs
and
a
conclusion.
2.)
a
comfortable
grasp
on
proper
spelling,
grammar
and
vocabulary.
3)
the
ability
to
transfer
what
they
read
on
the
page
into
what
they
think
of
a
topic,
into
coherent,
written
language.
It
doesn't
have
to
be
Pulitzer
Prize
worthy,
just
clearly,
succinctly
and
thoughtfully
stated.
4.)
the
ability
to
form
an
argument,
to
defend
both
sides
regardless
of
personal
preference.
5.)
an
imagination.
6.)
the
desire
to
ask
why,
why
not
and
who
cares?
In
Inventing
the
University,
Batholomae
refers
to
this
type
of
student
as
a
Nbasic
writer.O
I
find
this
label
somewhat
troubling,
partly
because
it
sounds
too
much
like
Nbase
writerO
but
more
because
I
am
immediately
prejudiced
towards
someone
given
a
NbasicO
level
of
competence.
I
like
Nbeginner
writer,O
better,
but
I
do
think
levels
of
writing
ability
can
and
should
be
classified
when
applied
to
an
institution
like
a
Writing
Center.
If
someone
is
equipped
with
these
simple
tools,
crafting
a
paper
becomes
a
more
feasible,
enjoyable
process.
I
have
always
been
told
that
I
write
too
much.
NToo
verbose,O
Ntoo
wordy,O
Nget
to
the
point,
Megan,O
Nhow
is
this
relevant?O
were
among
the
many
criticisms
I
received
in
high
school.
It's
not
that
I
didn't
have
a
focus
to
my
writing,
I
just
love
language
and
have
a
serious
attachment
to
its
endless
possibilities.
I'd
develop
a
line
I
liked
and
proceed
to
write
it
and
then
rewrite
it
using
alternate
vocabulary.
Was
it
such
a
crime
to
experiment
this
way?
Yes.
Rereading
my
work
was
tiring.
I
wince
when
I
go
through
old
essays
and
feel
sincere
pity
for
my
teachers
who
had
to
listen
to
me
go
on
and
on.
One
of
my
most
challenging
tasks
has
been
to
embrace
concision,
and
I
think
I've
gotten
over
my
tendency
to
ramble
(crossing
my
fingers
that
this
is
seven
pages).
Working
at
a
newspaper
when
I
studied
abroad
in
London
helped
to
cure
me,
in
a
painful,
brutal
two
months,
of
my
propensity
to
overwrite.
Five-hundred
words
meant
five-hundred
words
or
a
piece
didn't
run.
There
was
no
such
thing
as
five-hundred
and
twelve
words
or
five-hundred
words
with
footnotes.
Five-hundred
or
no
deal.
Now
that
I
tend
to
stick
to
the
point,
my
most
common
comments
from
Professors
and
fellow
students
are
positive.
I
still
love
to
utilize
the
flexibility
of
language,
and
due
to
my
creative
writing
endeavors,
tend
to
produce
work
that
is
more
of
a
creative-analytical
hybrid.
I
think
I
intrinsically
incorporate
techniques
I've
learned
from
poetry
and
shaping
fiction
into
all
my
academic
pursuits.
I
am
mindful
of
inflection,
tone,
form
and
writing
devices
that
often
elicit
comments
such
as,
Npoetic-likeO
and
Ncreatively
expressed.O
I
admit
I
can
get
carried
away,
but
I
do
not
wish
to
produce
bland
writing.
Sometimes
it
works,
sometimes
it
doesn't.
I
receive
both
criticism
and
praise
with
open
arms.
I'll
admit
sometimes
it's
difficult
to
hear
that
your
story
is
dull,
or
your
discussion
doesn't
exactly
translate,
but
I
believe
in
the
benefits
of
honesty.
The
workshop
environment
has
been
integrated
into
many
of
my
recent
classes,
and
I
find
that
this
structure
facilitates
positive
growth
in
students
and
a
possibility
for
significant
revision
tenfold.
In
London,
an
Editor
would
say,
Nthis
is
shit,O
and
walk
away.
I'm
over
being
discouraged.
But
I
am
sensitive
to
the
fact
that
writing
is
a
vulnerable
and
very
personal
experience.
In
elementary
school,
I
had
Nphonics
troubles,O
as
my
teacher
called
it.
Sometimes
I'd
confused
my
d's
and
b's
and
had
to
practice
writing
quietly
on
the
chalkboard
during
everyone
else's
nap
time.
I've
never
forgotten
how
that
felt
and
I
think
that
if
as
a
first-grader
I
can
get
over
that,
I
can
get
over
anything.
Thus
far,
my
writing
experience
at
Lafayette
has
been
extraordinary
in
the
sense
that
prior
to
it,
I
was
given
a
book
or
an
essay
topic
and
told,
NHere.
Read.
Write.O
Now
I
have
been
exposed
to
such
an
array
of
genres,
writers
and
experiences
and
I
can
create
a
piece
of
writing
on
my
own
terms.
It's
that
independence
I
am
thankful
for.
When
beginning
a
new
writing
project,
I
stick
to
several
bits
of
advice
I
have
accrued
in
class
and
elsewhere.
I
always
try
to
approach
a
topic
critically.
Thorough
research
on
a
subject
leads
to
the
most
substantial
results.
Multiple
revisions
of
a
piece
of
writing
are
imperative
if
change
is
desired.
Two
works
I
hold
close
to
me
and
reference
in
many
of
my
literacy
pursuits
are
Richard
Lanham's
Revising
Prose
and
Baxter
and
Turchi's
Bringing
the
Devil
To
His
Knees.
I
cannot
attempt
to
pinpoint
my
best
experience
as
a
writer.
Perhaps
my
worst
is
also
my
best,
but
I
certainly
learned
a
great
deal
from
it.
I
spent
this
past
fall
studying
abroad
in
London,
England.
Through
Boston
University,
I
enrolled
in
an
internship
program
and
landed
a
job
at
the
Sunday
Times,
one
of
the
most
reputable
broadsheets
in
the
UK.
The
position
was
a
rigorous,
high-pressure
one.
I
worked
every
Saturday,
and
while
my
friends
jet-setted
to
Spain
and
Paris,
I
got
the
Editor
coffee.
I'm
certain
I
contracted
arthritis
from
all
the
xeroxing,
filing
and
typing
I
endured.
I
like
to
think
a
little
estrogen
finally
did
the
male-dominated
newsroom
some
good,
because
after
a
few
weeks
of
drudgery,
I
was
assigned
to
write
an
article.
Two-hundred
and
fifty
words
on
the
one
year
anniversary
of
the
legalization
of
civil
partnerships
in
the
UK.
My
only
advice
from
one
of
the
editors
was:
NMake
it
clear
that
we
love
gays.O
I
stayed
up
all
night,
every
night
that
week
pouring
over
my
journalism
notebook
and
redrafting
my
piece
until
the
deadline
on
Thursday.
Later
Thursday
evening,
after
handing
in
my
work
with
moments
to
spare,
the
sweat
still
pouring
from
my
brow,
the
Editor
who
had
given
me
the
assignment
approached
me.
Half-laughing,
he
said,
NForgot
to
tell
you
we
dropped
your
article
on
Monday.
Not
enough
room
for
it
and
George
Michael
broke
up
with
his
boyfriend,
so
who
cares,
right?O
That
was
it?
I
slaved
away
for
days,
what
about
all
my
hard
work?
All
the
friends
who
were
expecting
to
see
my
name
in
print?
He
dropped
my
article
the
day
he
assigned
it
and
I
couldnOt
have
felt
more
defeated.
The
education
correspondent
who
sat
next
to
me
leaned
over
and
said,
NLesson
one.O
I
was
discouraged
and
embarrassed,
but
in
retrospect,
the
experience
proved
that
I
could
in
fact
be
concise.
I
forced
myself
to
write
two-hundred
and
fifty
words
and
although
embarrassed,
survived
that
experience
and
the
two-month
internship
unscathed.
It
is
therefore
something
I
now
reflect
upon
with
pride
rather
than
shame.
My
internship
at
the
Sunday
Times
helped
me
tighten
up
my
writing,
and
also
taught
me
a
lot
about
the
realm
of
journalism.
Additionally,
my
interest
in
theatrical
criticism
was
increased
considerably
thanks
to
the
time
I
spent
with
the
Entertainment
Editor
and
theatre
critic.
I
am
very
interested
in
both
professions
and
hope
to
pursue
them
after
college.
I
do
not,
however,
wish
to
be
stuck
behind
a
computer
screen
like
many
of
the
journalists
I
encountered,
which
brings
me
to
my
final
point.
As
far
as
implementation
goes,
my
preference
to
hand
write
has
and
always
will
be
an
integral
part
of
my
writing
process.
If
I
sit
in
front
of
a
blank
computer
screen
in
an
attempt
to
write,
it
will
most
likely
remain
blank.
Call
me
archaic,
but
I
need
to
actually
write,
to
see
my
work
form
on
the
page.
Writing
is
a
tangible,
scruffy
process.
I
like
ink
stains
and
cross
outs.
A
sore
wrist
means
hard
work
has
been
done.
Give
me
a
pilot
rolling
ball
pen,
black,
extra
fine,
and
any
type
of
surface
that
absorbs
ink,
be
it
paper,
a
napkin
or
tree
bark,
and
I'm
good
to
go.
Writing
is
a
process
that
I
feel
so
close
to,
and
it
is
from
this
intimacy
that
my
ambivalence
about
the
craft
has
sprung.
I
thrive
while
writing
but
I
also
struggle
with
it,
and
I
want
to
learn
as
much
as
I
can
about
its
many
intricacies.
It
is
this
openness
and
this
sense
of
curiosity
I
wish
to
share
with
other
student
writers,
and
to
