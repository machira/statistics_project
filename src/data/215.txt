History
As
A
Writer
Writing
is
an
important
part
of
any
individual's
life.
My
earliest
attempts
of
writing
were
early
on
in
elementary
school.
I
remember
when
Mrs.
Greene
used
to
write
a
word
on
the
board
and
then
make
us
copy
it.
This
was
the
basis
on
which
I
began
to
learn
to
write.
After
we
had
a
few
words
mastered,
the
next
step
was
to
start
to
put
these
words
together
to
form
sentences.
I
remember
attempting
to
get
down
on
paper
wonderful,
complicated
sentences
lik$,
The
sky
is
blue.
This
sounds
stupid
and
pointless
to
me
now,
but
at
the
time
it
was
a
major
task.
After
more
fine-tuning
of
these
simple
sentence
building
blocks,
it
was
time
for
me
to
attempt
to
put
on
paper
ideas
of
my
own
on
an
assignment
that
my
teacher
gave.
For
example,
an
assignment
might
be:
Write
on
what
you
did
on
your
summer
vacation.
In
reply
to
this
I
might
write:
I
went
to
the
beach.
I
also
played
baseball.
I
had
fun.
I
wrote
very
simple
sentences,
and
in
the
most
basic
manner
tried
to
get
my
point
across
to
my
teacher.
As
I
moved
up
grade
wise,
I
needed
to
grow
more
as
a
writer.
I
learned
how
to
combine
sentences
into
complex
sentences,
and
how
to
use
conjunctions.
This
way
my
sentences
were
not
as
choppy.
I
could
get
my
point
across,
and
you
did
not
have
to
pause
every
third
word
when
you
were
reading
it.
My
sentence
might
read
something
like:
I
went
to
the
beach
and
played
baseball.
This,
again,
was
a
major
step
in
my
writing
maturity.
I
fine
tuned
this
process
through
practicing
and
progressed
into
middle
school.
The
assignments
that
were
given
to
us
became
more
and
more
complex.
Much
more
thought
had
to
be
given
before
you
picked
up
your
pencil
and
began
writing.
For
an
example,
I
had
Mrs.
Demco
for
6th
grade
reading.
She
made
us
do
SRAs.
SRAs
were
small
handout
readings
at
different
levels,
and
at
the
end
you
had
to
answer
a
series
of
questions
in
essay
form.
I
hated
these
readings!
The
questions
made
you
think
about
what
you'd
read
and
then
draw
conclusions
from
this.
This
was
a
first
for
me,
ai^d
I
struggled
with
it
at
first.
The
more
I
did
it,
the
better
I
got
though.
By
the
end
of
the
year,
I
did
it
as
well
as
anyone.
I
recall
having
Ms.
Mesing
for
7th
grade
English.
She
made
us
write
on
Literature
that
we
had
read.
This,
again,
was
building
from
Mrs.
Demco's
class.
We
had
to
gather
information
and
draw
conclusions
from
what
we'd
read,
and
then
put
that
onto
paper.
This
was,
again,
a
challenge
that
I
was
able
to
overcome.
Eventually
I
made
it
to
high
school.
By
then,
writing
was
getting
to
be
second
nature
to
me,
but
I
was
not
done
maturing
as
a
writer.
I
had
the
feared
Ms,
McKinney
in
10th
grade.
She
taught
American
Literature,
and
basically
this
was
an
all
essay
class.
We
read
something,
and
then
we
were
forced
to
relate
the
book
to
a
personal
experience
that
we
had.
An
assignment
might
be:
Name
and
describe
a
personal
experience
that
relates
to
one
that
Tom
Sawyer
had
in
The
Adventures
of
Tom
Sawyer
and
Huckleberry
Fin.
This
made
me
think
about
a
lot
of
different
things.
It
made
me
think
back
and
recall
different
adventures
that
Tom
Sawyer
had
been
on,
it
made
me
think
about
experiences
of
mine
that
might
relate
to
the
adventures
of
Tom,
and
finally
it
made
me
tie
all
this
together
in
a
stunning
paper.
Ms.
McKinney
was
big
on
us
using
lots
of
action
verbs,
and
we
were
never
to
use
the
horrible
word
very
when
describing
something.
Aggressive,
descriptive
adjectives
were
another
one
of
Ms.
McKinney's
big
concepts.
In
her
words,
I
want
enough
colorful
description
that
I
can
touch,
taste,
and
see
everything
that
is
happening
in
your
paper.
Finally,
I
reached
college.
I
came
to
Lafayette
college
my
freshman
year,
and
I
took
first
year
seminar
(FYS).
In
this
course,
I
had
my
first
experience
^ith
turning
in
multiple
drafts.
In
high
school,
this
was
encouraged,
but
not
required.
I
never
really
felt
the
need
to
do
this.
I
did
well
just
writing
a
paper,
checking
it
over
quickly,
making
grammatical
changes,
and
then
turning
it
in.
This
was
not
good
enough
in
college
though.
This
was
my
first
experience
dealing
with
a
WA,
and
it
was
extremely
helpful,
but
painful
too.
When
I
got
done
with
a
paper,
I
thought
that
it
was
perfect.
I
did
not
want
to
here
that
my
conclusion
was
weak,
or
my
beginning
needed
a
little
work,
or
that
this
part
of
the
paper
was
too
wordy.
After
I
thought
about
it
and
worked
on
the
areas
that
the
WA
suggested,
I
saw
how
much
my
paper
improved
and
that
taking
the
time
to
revise
my
paper
could
really
boost
my
writing
quality.
Revising
a
paper
became
an
even
more
important
concept
when
I
had
first
year
writing
(FYW).
In
this
class,
we
would
work
on
the
same
paper
for
many
revisions,
where
as
we
basically
revised
the
paper
once
and
then
turned
in
the
final
draft
in
FYS.
In
FYW
we
might
go
over
a
paper
with
our
WA,
meet
with
our
professor
twice
about
the
paper,
and
have
a
paper
reviewed
by
a
peer
once.
That's
four
revisions
on
the
same
paper!
This
was
a
big
step
in
my
maturity
as
a
writer.
It
took
me
a
while
to
adjust
to
this
writing
method
as
well,
but
in
the
end
I
feel
that
I
gained
a
lot
from
it
and
became
a
much
better
writer,
and
a
much
better
editor
of
my
own
papers
and
my
peers
papers
as
well.
Finally,
my
last
writing
experience
was
in
my
VAST
class
last
semester.
This
writing
class
was
very
different
than
others
I've
taken.
It
dealt
with
technical
writing,
and
I
had
to
work
on
cutting
out
a
lot
of
the
wordiness
that
I
often
use.
I
had
to
become
more
concise
and
get
to
my
point
quickly.
For
example,
if
I
were
writing
about
the
structure
of
a
certain
building,
I
would
not
say
that
the
large,
lugubrious,
building
stood
300
stories
high.
That
is
too
much
description
(the
too
much
description
that
was
appropriate
just
a
few
years
ago
in
Is.
McKinney7s
literature
class).
I
had
to
just
cut
to
the
chase
and
say
that
the
building
stood
300
stories
high.
So,
I
learned
that
in
different
circumstances
different
writing
styles
are
appropriate.
In
conclusion,
over
the
years
my
writing
experiences
have
helped
me
to
grow
as
a
writer.
From
the
building
blocks
of
elementary
school,
through
middle
school
and
high
school,
and
now
college
my
writing
experiences
have
been
like
steps
of
a
latter
helping
me
to
move
up
the
ranks
as
a
mature,
literate,
and
competent
writer.
