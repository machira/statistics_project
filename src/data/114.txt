My
history
as
a
writer
has
been
one
of
slowly-built
confidence.
From
elementary
school
through
college,
my
writing
has
developed
from
something
approaching
palling
teeth
into
an
almost
enjoyable,
natural
process.
By
writing
many
different
types
of
essays,
research
papers,
and
the
like
I
have
been
able
to
develop
a
personal
style
that
works
for
me.
The
journey
has
been
anything
but
simple,
however...
My
first
writing
assignment
I
can
remember
was
in
second
grade.
The
teacher,
Mrs.
Barger,
had
decided
to
explore
the
fascinating
world
of
the
Japanese
poetry,
haiku.
This
particular
structure
required
a
certain
number
of
syllables
for
each
line
of
the
work.
To
me,
this
directive
made
an
already
difficult
task
next
to
impossible.
Now,
not
only
did
I
have
to
write
poetry,
but
I
had
to
be
responsible
about
the
number
of
words,
syllables
and
lines
I
was
using.
After
huffing
and
puffing
for
a
bit
about
how
unfair
and
unfeasible
the
assignment
was
and
getting
nowhere,
I
decided
to
get
it
done
as
quickly
as
possible.
I
cannot
remember
what
I
wrote
about
except
for
one
small
pieces
the
word
eggs.
It
came
at
the
end
of
the
poem,
therefore
signaling
the
end
to
my
haiku
hell.
Needless
to
say,
I
was
thrilled
at
having
finished
this
unpleasant
experience
and
marched
up
to
Mrs.
Barger's
desk
to
hand
in
my
masterpiece.
As
I
watched
my
teacher's
face
while
she
read
my
poem,
I
did
not
see
the
reaction
I
had
expected.
Instead
of
praising
my
brilliant
and
insightful
piece,
she
had
the
gall
to
tell
my
that
eggs
only
had
one
syllable
and
that
therefore
my
poem
did
not
fit
the
haiku
structure,
At
first,
I
was
not
sure
how
to
respond
to
this
challenge,
but
I
quickly
recovered.
I
vehemently
argued
that
eggs
did
in
fact
have
two
syllables:
eg:gs,
as
anyone
could
see.
Finally,
she
seemed
to
see
the
error
of
her
ways
and
admitted
to
me
that
I
was
right
and
accepted
the
poem.
I
remember
feeling
immensely
proud
of
myself
for
standing
my
ground
in
the
face
of
a
disagreeable
authority
figure.
Luckily,
this
argumentative
disposition
did
not
last
long.
I
eventually
saw
the
value
in
anticipating
any
weak
areas
or
criticisms
in
my
papers
and
learned
to
structure
them
so
that
I
addressed
these
trouble
spots
early
on.
This
enlightenment
did
not
happen
overnight,
however*
it
took
several
years
and
many
more
Swiss
cheese"
papers
before
I
finally
understood
what
I
was
doing
wrong.
The
next
assignment
that
I
remember
having
an
effect
on
the
development
of
my
writing
was
in
sixth
grade.
Everyone
had
to
complete
a
science
project
which
included
a
five-page
summary
of
our
experiment
and
its
findings.
Upon
hearing
this
mandated
length,
I
was
horrified.
That
was
more
pages
than
I
had
ever
heard
of
being
assigned.
I
worried
about
it
for
a
few
days
before
realizing
that
I
had
better
get
started
if
I
was
going
to
have
a
hope
of
finishing
on
time.
I	decided
to
study
the
effect
of
color
on
small
children's
reaction
time
to
stimuli
with
the
hope
that
brighter
colors
would
trigger
a
faster
response
than
would
darker
colors.
After
gathering
the
data
through
a
series
of
teats
with
different
children,
I
went
about
writing
the
summary.
I
remember
dreading
this
part.
There
was
no
way
that
I
would
ever
be
able
to
write
that
much
about
anything,
but
I
did
not
have
a
choice.
Surprisingly,
the
paper
practically
wrote
itself.
All
I
did
was
guide
it
along
and
try
to
sum
up
everything
at
the
end.
This
feeling
of
relative
ease
came
to
describe
most
of
my
writing
endeavors
through
the
end
of
high
school,
with
a
few
exceptions,
of
course.
For
the
most
part,
however,
writing
papers
during
this
time
was
not
difficult.
Rather,
it
became
almost
enjoyable
because
of
the
repeated
success
I
was
having.
This
sense
of
effortless
satisfaction
came
to
an
abrupt
halt
my
sophomore
year
of
high
school,
though.
That
was
known
as
the
infamous
Thesis
Year"
to
all
the
freshmen
signing
up
for
sophomore
classes.
Both
the
Honors
English
and
History
courses
required
research
papers
in
the
neighborhood
of
twenty
pages
after
extensive
periods
of
reading
and
gathering
support
for
the
thesis.
In
years
past,
both
of
these
had
been
assigned
during
the
same
semester,
making
an
already
difficult
task
twice
as
hard.
It
was
because
of
the
belief
that
my
sophomore
year
would
be
the
same
as
those
of
previous
Honors
students
that
I
chickened
out
and
opted
for
Level
2
English.
That
course
also
had
a
thesis
but
it
was
significantly
easiers
instead
of
reading
all
of
an
author's
works,
students
were
only
required
to
read
three
and
were
allowed
to
choose
from
a
wider
range
of
writers,
My
luck
being
what
it
was,
the
two
teachers
involved
with
the
Honors
courses
picked
ffiy
sophomore
year
to
work
together
and
schedule
the
two
papers
in
different
semesters.
I
was
kicking
myself
for
not
taking
the
Honors
English,
but
it
was
too
late.
Instead,
I
focused
on
the
papers
I
did
have
to
write
rather
than
the
one
I
should
have
been
doing.
The
history
thesis
was
assigned
first
and
I
quickly
decided
that
I
wanted
to
research
some
aspect
of
World
War
II*
After
waffling
back
and
forth
between
several
topics
I
finally
determined
that
I
would
study
the
effects
of
Nazi
propaganda
on
the
young
people
of
Germany.
While
this
topic
was
depressing
and
even
outright
sickening
in
sores
respects,
it
was
still
fascinating
to
me.
This
being
my
first
real
research
paper,
along
with
the
rest
of
the
sophomore
class,
the
teacher,
Mrs.
Johnson,
gave
us
a
set
of
directions
for
how
to
go
about
researching
materials,
putting
all
the
data
together
in
a
comprehensible
order,
and
then
writing
many,
many
drafts
before
the
final
product
would
be
ready*
I
followed
these
instructions
to
the
letter
because
they
provided
the
only
sense
of
right
or
wrong
that
I
had
about
the
whole
process.
I
took
quotations
from
each
of
my
five
sources
and
copied
them
down
meticulously
onto
separate
index
cards
followed
by
the
page
number
and
which
source
it
came
from*
I
put
them
in
some
sort
of
order
according
to
the
rough
outline
I
had
organized
earlier
and
started
writing.
I
remember
feeling
proud
of
the
finished
product,
but
still
nervous
about
handing
in
such
a
large
project
for
grading.
It
had
been
in
the
works
for
so
long
that
I
was
not
sure
if
I
was
ready
to
let
go-
That
feeling
has
stayed
with
me
since
that
paper:
in
putting
so
much
of
myself
into
an
assignment
for
an
intense
period
of
time
I
always
have
trouble
believing
that
X
have
actually
finished*
I
had
the
same
experience
with
my
English
thesis,
which
I
wrote
on
three
of
Edgar
Allan
Poe's
works.
I
became
so
involved
with
the
research
and
writing
that
I
did
not
want
to
hand
it
in*
That
paper
earned
me
an
A
and
a
lot
of
praise
for
my
supposed
writing
ability.
There
had
been
other
teachers
who
had
told
me
that
I
wrote
very
well,
but
it
was
not
until
Mr*
Goddard
told
me
that
I
began
to
believe
it.
I
cannot
exactly
why
it
was
not
until
this
point
that
this
enlightenment
happened,
but
I
have
an
idea.
wr.
Goddard
was
the
first
teacher
I
really
liked
and
cared
about
what
his
opinion
of
me
and
my
work
was.
That
is
not
to
say
that
I
was
apathetic
or
hostile
to
previous
teachers,
but
rather
that
he
inspired
me
to
work
harder.
I
remember
one
short
essay
I
wrote
for
him
that
was
nowhere
near
what
it
should
have
been*
I
had
spent
the
week
previous
focusing
on
another
assignment
and
had
been
forced
to
turn
in
something
I
was
not
happy
with.
Before
handing
back
the
papers
to
everyone,
he
first
went
through
them
all
saying
what
was
wrong
with
them.
He
did
not
use
names,
but
he
looked
at
whoever
he
was
criticizing
at
the
moment,
so
everyone
knew
who
had
done
what.
He
got
to
mine
and
ripped
it
apart.
He
wondered
aloud
where
the
thesis
was
if
not
in
the
first
paragraph
and
why
I
had
decided
to
write
about
Iraq,
of
all
things?
Though
this
tirade
only
lasted
about
fifteen
seconds,
it
felt
like
an
eternity*
I
had
let
down
the
first
teacher
whose
opinion
had
really
mattered,
if
there
had
been
a
rock
in
that
room,
I
would
have
crawled
under
it.
After
receiving
such
high
praise
for
my
thesis,
I
felt
like
I
owed
him
renewed
proof
of
my
ability.
Luckily,
this
need
to
convince
teachers
and
later
professors
of
my
competence
has
subsided
somewhat
in
the
years
since
I
was
a
sophomore
in
high
school.
One
of
the
reasons
for
this
had
to
do
with
an
assignment
called
the
Self
Paper
X
wrote
senior
year
for
a
combination
English/American
History
course
called
Humanities.
It
was
taught
my
Mr.
Murphy
and
Mrs*
Goddard,
wife
of
the
esteemed
Mr*
Goddard,
who
I
would
have
had
if
I
had
taken
the
Honors
English
two
years
previously.
The
self
Paper
was
assigned
towards
the
end
of
the
year
in
hopes
of
getting
the
members
of
the
class
to
look
back
at
the
first
eighteen
years
of
their
lives
before
we
headed
off
to
college
or
parts
unknown*
At
first,
it
was
just
another
paper,
but
that
narrow
vision
widened
as
I
got
further
into
it-
I
recalled
significant
events
in
ray
life,
both
positive
and
negative,
and
tried
to
put
it
all
together
in
some
sort
of
logical
order*
I
ended
up
just
handing
in
my
life
on
paper
and
not
knowing
what
to
expect.
I
got
an
A
on
that
paper.
Both
teachers
read
and
commented
on
it
and
both
said
that
I
had
a
flair
for
description
and
a
talent
for
setting
a
basic
context
quickly
and
sufficiently,
which
was
important
in
writing.
This
was
the
point
where
I
finally
believed
I
had
talent,
X
was
finally
able
to
finish
and
hand
in
something
I
had
not
written
for
someone
else-
Although
it
had
originally
been
another
assignment,
it
had
quickly
developed
into
something
approaching
an
extended
journal
entry.
Because
the
Self
paper
became
such
a
personal
experience,
I
was
able
to
stop
worrying
about
the
grade
and
focus
on
the
writing.
This
confidence
was
short-lived,
however,
when
I
arrived
at
Lafayette,
I
immediately
feared
my
first
assignment.
I
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
but
was
sure
that
I
would
not
be
able
to
do
it.
In
this
sea
of
uncertainty,
X
clung
to
the
professor's
instructions
as
if
they
were
a
life
raft.
I
went
through
all
the
motions
as
I
had
in
high
school
plus
a
meeting
with
our
WA,
and
handed
it
in*
I
had
completely
lost
the
sense
of
self-assurance
I
had
acquired
after
the
Self
Paper
and
was
once
again
writing
for
someone
else*
That
first
paper
received
a
B
and
some
general
comments
and
directions
to
follow
for
the
next
one.
I
did
slightly
better
on
the
second
assignment
and
by
the
final
essay,
I
had
regained
my
confidence
after
my
first
college
A.
Even
though
I
still
feel
some
apprehension
when
big
papers
are
assigned,
especially
by
professors
I
have
not
had
yet,
I
am
more
or
less
confident
in
my
writing
ability.
(I
feel
like
I
should
be
knocking
on
wood
as
I
say
that
with
a
senior
thesis
looming
on
the
horizon*)
All
in
all,
however,
writing
has
been
a
positive
and
constructive
influence
in
my
life,
it
has
proven
to
be
an
area
in
which
I
can
excel
while
simultaneously
enjoying
the
experience.
As
I
wait
to
begin
my
senior
year
of
college,
I
can
look
back
at
my
history
as
a
writer
and
be
proud
of
accomplishments.
Hopefully,
I
can
take
some
of
my
experiences
and
use
them
to
help
incoming
freshmen
as
they
make
the
transition
from
high
school
to
college
writing.
