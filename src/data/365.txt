Lafayette
College
Writing
Narrative:
Conference
2002
8/16/02
Over
the
past
year,
I
have
had
many
experiences
that
have
helped
to
evolve
my
writing.
Becoming
a
WA
is
something
that
has,
in
my
mind,
had
the
most
influence
of
all
my
experiences.
The
experience
has
allowed
my
to
broaden
and
improve
my
ability
to
work
with
others,
solve
problems,
as
well
as
improve
my
writing.
At
some
point
in
all
of
our
lives,
I'm
sure
we
have
all
been
in
some
sort
of
position
of
authority
or
experience,
as
I
know
we
have
all
worked
on
an
equal
plane
with
our
peers.
Being
a
WA
asks
us
to
combine
these
two
roles
into
one:
which
can
seem
like
a
daunting
task
at
times.
When
I
first
received
my
assignment
last
year,
I
learned
that
I
was
to
be
the
writing
associate
for
an
upper
level
political
theory
class.
I
had
taken
the
introduction
class
and
previously
worked
with
the
professor,
which
was
promising.
However,
when
I
received
the
class
list,
I
noticed
the
students
consisted
of
mostly
my
year
and
older,
with
many
of
them
being
close
friends
of
mine.
I
immediately
became
uncertain
of
my
ability.
I
think
this
is
a
fairly
common
feeling
before
one's
first
WA
semester.
However,
I
discovered
that
once
I
met
with
the
students,
having
people
I
was
friends
with
became
an
asset,
rather
than
a
hindrance
as
I
had
previously
thought
it
might
become.
I
discovered
that
most
students
realize
you
are
there
for
a
reason,
well
many
reasons.
We
all
have
the
ability
to
be
there
and
more
importantly,
we
are
all
there
because
we
want
to
help
our
peers.
Aside
from
helping
me
to
acclimate
myself
to
new
roles
and
circumstances,
my
writing
over
the
past
year
has
also
been
directly
affected
through
my
association
with
the
Writing
Program.
I
have
noticed
many
changes
in
my
own
writing
as
well.
For
instance,
I
have
realized
that
if
I
am
in
a
class
with
a
WA,
I
have
become
much
more
considerate,
as
I
hope
we
all
are.
Understanding
the
amount
of
work
that
goes
into
this
job
has
changed
the
way
I
approach
any
conferences
I
myself
may
have
as
a
writer.
I
now
understand
the
importance
of
having
a
solid
draft
before
meeting,
when
before
last
year
I
tended
to
be
a
last
minute
writer.
Coming
into
the
conference
on
time
and
with
questions
in
hand
is
now
a
habit
of
mine.
Even
if
I
am
not
meeting
with
a
WA,
I
have
found
myself,
in
mid-draft,
stepping
away
from
my
work
and
approaching
it,
not
as
the
writer,
but
as
a
WA
to
see
if
I
can
get
a
different
perspective.
I
have
found
that
this
has
dramatically
improved
my
writing,
from
a
technical
standpoint.
Although
I
may
not
necessarily
point
them
all
out
in
my
conferences,
I
have
become
very
aware
of
grammatical
errors
in
writing
(at
least
from
where
I
was
before
becoming
a
WA).
Stepping
away
from
my
writing
also
allows
me
to
work
on
my
work
from
a
grammatical
point
of
view.
Although
I
have
had
many
important
experiences
over
the
past
year
in
the
capacity
of
a
WA,
I
have
learned
one
lesson
which
I
would
have
to
say
is
the
most
important.
This
lesson
is
important
in
the
capacity
of
WA;
however,
it
transcends
into
all
realms
of
life
and
I
can
think
of
no
better
piece
of
advice
to
impart
onto
the
new
WA's.
Keeping
the
lines
of
communication
open
is
vital
to
have
a
successful
relationship
in
any
capacity,
academic
or
otherwise.
In
my
first,
and
incidentally
only,
semester
as
a
WA,
I
was
working
with
a
professor
with
whom
I
had
already
had
a
previous
relationship.
I
have
come
to
realize
that
there
are
both
positives
as
well
as
negatives
to
this
situation.
He
and
I
knew
each
other
well
and
had
a
good
working
relationship
in
the
past;
therefore,
we
were
able
to
skip
the
awkward
beginning
of
the
semester.
We
were
able
to
jump
right
into
things
and
have
a
free
flow
of
ideas.
I
also
felt
very
comfortable
asking
him
questions
and
offering
suggestions
where
I
may
not
have
been
so
comfortable
had
I
not
previously
known
him.
However,
one
of
the
drawbacks
of
this
situation
was
that
since
we
had
already
known
each
other,
we
entered
the
situation
with
our
own
preconceived
notions
of
things.
The
problem
of
miscommunication,
unfortunately,
can
offer
regardless
of
whether
this
situation
occurs
or
not.
My
situation
arose
because
there
was
a
lot
of
confusion
as
to
what
the
professor
was
expecting
from
the
students.
There
seemed
to
be
a
mysterious
blueprint
that
was
somehow
not
being
discussed.
As
a
result
of
this,
I
had
many
conferences
that
were
frustrating
for
both
the
students,
as
well
as
myself
and
consisted
of
a
lot
of
'he
said,
she
said'.
This
leads
to
counterproductive
conferences
in
my
opinion.
Later
in
the
semester
I
met
with
the
professor
with
a
list
of
questions,
many
of
which
came
from
the
students,
as
well
as
some
that
came
from
me.
They
discussed
confusion
from
the
last
paper
and
were
very
explicit
to
try
to
get
concrete
answers.
I
have
found
that
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
get
professors
to
be
concrete.
I
found
this
cleared
up
much
of
the
confusion
from
my
round
one
conferences.
I
have
also
seen
this
translated
into
my
own
writing.
I
make
a
concerted
effort
to
be
very
clear
about
my
goals,
evidence,
and
conclusion
in
my
own
writing
because
I
have
now
experienced,
first
hand,
how
a
nebulous
piece
of
writing
(assignment
or
paper
alike)
can
cause
confusion
and
distaste
on
the
part
of
the
reader.
This
is
just
one
of
the
many
ways
I
really
feel
my
experiences
as
a
WA
have
improved
my
writing
over
the
past
year.
Over
the
past
year
I
have
discovered
that
my
experiences
as
a
WA
have,
more
than
anything,
changed
my
perspective
about
numerous
aspects
of
the
writing
process.
Prior
to
my
involvement
with
the
program,
I
was
not
the
biggest
fan
of
peer
editing;
in
many
ways
I
didn't
see
the
high
value
that
was
being
placed
on
it
here
at
the
college.
However,
after
being
a
WA
for
a
year,
I
have
discovered
that
using
one's
peers
in
any
situation
can
dramatically
improve
a
piece
of
writing
in
so
many
ways.
I
have
seen
it
make
our
ideas
and
thoughts
more
concrete
and
understandable.
I
have
seen
it
make
our
writing
more
on
target
in
places
where
it
was
once
divergent
from
the
assignment.
I
have
also
seen
writing
become
stronger
and
more
interesting
through
more
vibrant
and
clearer
language.
Exactly
one
year
ago
almost
to
the
day,
I
was
sitting
here
at
my
parent's
computer
trying
to
write
my
writing
history
from
day
one
to
the
present.
At
the
time,
I
thought
it
was
a
daunting
task
and
couldn't
imagine
how
I
could
fit
all
20
years
of
my
writing
experiences
into
a
mere
7
pages
of
thoughts.
Now
I
am
sitting
at
the
same
computer
one
year
later
trying
to
write
a
history
of
my
writing;
however,
now
I
only
have
the
past
year
to
cover
in
my
thoughts.
As
I
think
back,
most
of
my
thoughts
and
experiences
that
are
involved
with
writing
are
all
associated
with
the
writing
program.
There
are
very
few
that
came
from
my
own
classes
last
fall.
However,
as
the
past
year
has
been
about
changing
perspectives
for
me
in
my
writing,
there
are
a
few
more
relevant
experiences
in
my
writing.
I
took
an
econometrics
class
last
fall,
which
is
a
economics
class
here
at
school.
The
class
deals
with
regression
lines
and
mathematical
predictions
for
common
phenomenon.
I
rarely
associated
these
kinds
of
issues
with
writing.
In
my
mind,
my
government
classes
were
writing
courses
and
my
business
classes,
especially
my
economics
ones,
were
mathematically
driven.
However,
towards
the
end
of
the
semester
we
were
asked
to
create
a
major
paper
based
from
a
huge
research
project
done
with
these
regression
lines
and
mathematical
experiments.
I
was
confronted
with
a
type
of
writing
that
I
had,
up
to
this
point
in
my
life,
had
almost
no
experience.
Turning
numbers
and
scores
into
a
piece
of
writing
without
just
listing
results
in
a
chart
was
a
complicated
task
for
me.
I
had
to
take
a
lot
of
time
to
learn
how
to
express
my
thoughts
without
repeating
charts
in
my
paper.
I
found
myself
having
to
leave
my
work
many
times
and
go
back
to
it
with
a
fresh
perspective.
I
also
found
myself
reading
more
of
my
work
out
loud
to
hear
how
it
sounded
when
read
aloud.
I
found
that
many
sentences
I
was
having
trouble
with
either
were
immediately
fixed
or
thrown
out
as
soon
as
I
read
them
aloud
to
myself
or
someone
else.
Learning
to
write
in
a
different
genre
requires
using
skills
that
we
may
not
be
forced
to
use
when
dealing
with
writing
forms
with
which
we
are
already
comfortable.
I
see
thin
experience
as
one
that
has
improved
my
skills
as
a
critical
writer
and
allowed
me
to
expand
my
comfort
zone
in
my
writing.
Because
of
this,
I
think
that
I
will
be
better
able
to
assist
my
peers
in
my
conferences
this
semester
because
I
will
have
one
more
experience
to
bring
to
the
table
as
I
sit
down
to
meet
with
them.
Being
able
to
write
and
read
outside
of
our
comfort
zone
is
a
really
important
quality
for
a
WA
to
have;
it
is
also
one
that
I
feel
my
skills
have
dramatically
improved
over
the
past
year.
My
second
semester
last
year
was
filled
with
many
new
and
interesting
writing
experiences.
Because
I
was
in
London,
England,
at
an
international
school,
certain
issues
arose
that
might
not
necessarily
have
at
Lafayette.
My
experiences
with
language
during
those
five
months
were
some
of
the
most
interesting
and
confusing
of
my
life.
I
traveled
to
different
countries
where
they
were
speaking
foreign
languages
then
I
returned
home
(to
London)
and
heard
words,
phrases,
and
accents
that
were
incomprehensible
to
me
at
times.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
really
felt
that
I
did
not
have
a
complete
understanding
of
my
own
language.
In
many
ways
this
frightened
me,
and
at
the
very
least
has
given
me
a
new
perspective
in
helping
others.
I
think
I
now
know
what
it
is
like
to
have
trouble
with
a
part
of
the
language
we
speak
and
write.
Perhaps
that
trouble
area
may
not
be
a
British
accent
for
some
students,
but
the
rules
of
grammar
in
a
particular
area
or
a
solid
structure
of
an
argument.
I
have
always
loved
writing
and
I
don't
think
that
before
this
experience
I
could
really
identify
with
these
particular
troubles
of
the
students.
Now,
however,
I
have
had
a
similar
experience
and
I
feel
this
will
allow
me
to
bring
more
to
the
table
to
better
help
the
students.
As
I
am
about
to
begin
my
senior
year,
my
writing
has
begun
to
take
a
fascinating
yet
frightening
turn.
While
I
ready
myself
for
the
LSAT's
and
law
school
applications,
I
have
begun
to
see
changes
in
my
writing.
One
of
the
most
important
portions
of
the
test
for
which
I
am
currently
preparing
is
logical
reasoning.
This
entails
reading
small
excerpts
and
looking
at
the
logic
that
was
used
in
the
arguments
and
assessing
it
in
different
ways.
This
is
a
new
way
of
thinking
for
me,
at
least
in
a
conscience
sense.
It
has
affected
everything
I
read
and
write
now;
I
am
constantly
looking
at
how
I
got
from
point
A
to
B.
I
think
his
new
dimension
of
my
writing
thought
will
allow
me
to
be
a
better
critical
reader.
This
experience
has
made
me
a
more
active
reader,
which
is
vital
to
being
a
good
WA.
I
am
also
beginning
to
write
my
application
essays
for
law
school.
Although
this
is
not
a
new
experience
for
me
(we
all
wrote
essays
to
get
into
college),
this
is
a
type
of
writing
that
I
have
not
spent
much
time
perfecting
since
high
school.
Sitting
down
with
a
black
piece
of
paper
and
writing
something,
true
or
otherwise,
to
show
the
reader
who
I
am
as
the
writer,
as
a
person,
can
seem
like
a
near
impossible
task.
Writing
with
more
passion
and
less
purpose
is
how
I
try
to
look
at
it.
I
am
not
reporting
the
results
of
an
experiment,
nor
am
I
recalling
the
history
of
a
particular
political
movement.
These
are
things
where
the
facts
are
important.
All
I
have
to
do
in
this
writing
is
show
the
reader
who
I
am
as
a
person;
how
I
choose
to
do
that
is
of
less
importance.
When
I
was
younger,
used
to
write
with
this
kind
of
passion
all
the
time.
I
am
now
discovering
that
as
I
have
gotten
older
and
more
focused
on
my
work,
I
have
diverged
from
this
passion
on
which
I
used
to
pride
myself.
Therefore,
I
am
now
writing
essays
and
have
set
a
goal
for
my
writing
over
the
next
year.
I
believe
you
should
always
have
a
goal.
I
want
to
put
this
kind
of
passion
into
my
writing,
all
my
writing
this
year.
My
goal
is
to
have
some
piece
of
myself
in
everything
I
do,
to
try
to
express
my
passion
and
my
person
to
every
reader
of
my
work.
