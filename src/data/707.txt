Returning
WA
Narrative
Starting
an
essay
is
the
hardest
part
of
the
process.
I
have
created
four
or
five
different
opening
statements
for
this
particular
reflection,
but
when
the
second
sentence
becomes
a
necessity,
I
reach
an
obstinate
and
entirely
unhelpful
brick
wall.
Have
I
brainstormed?
Yes.
Do
I
have
points
and
anecdotes
I
would
like
to
include?
Certainly.
Could
I
have
come
up
with
a
better
way
to
introduce
this
writing
narrative?
By
the
second
or
third
draft,
probably,
but
at
the
moment,
no.
This
is
not
a
problem;
as
I
have
assured
my
WA-ees
on
many
occasions,
starting
the
essay
is
the
hardest
part,
and
now
that
there
are
words
to
combat
the
daunting
white
emptiness,
we
are
on
our
way
to
a
sweet
and
rewarding
victory.
My
VAST
professor
advised
my
class:
always
leave
the
paper
on
a
high
note,
at
a
point
to
which
you
will
want
to
return.
My
partner
professor
of
two
semesters
shares
her
secret
to
success
with
her
students:
save
the
introduction
for
last.
So
I
recommend:
begin
by
writing
the
section
of
the
paper
with
which
you
feel
most
comfortable.
I
am
a
self-diagnosed
procrastinator;
the
army
of
seemingly
endless
possibilities
that
confronts
me
with
every
new
writing
assignment
easily
intimidates
me.
If
the
fear
of
creating
a
convincing
and
useful
introduction
is
keeping
me
from
writing
the
rest
of
the
paper,
I
begin
in
the
middle.
For
the
past
two
semesters
of
my
WA
experience,
I
have
worked
with
an
upper
level
art
history
class
rather
than
a
VAST.
Since
the
professor
asks
her
classes
to
spend
the
semester
writing
one,
twenty-page
essay,
I
begin
working
with
her
students
from
the
very
beginning
stages,
immediately
after
they
submit
their
research
proposals.
My
initial
expectation
of
the
WA
job
consisted
of
me
reading
nearly
complete
drafts
and
discussing
them
with
their
respective
writers.
Yet
as
a
WA
for
a
rather
untraditional
WA-assisted
course,
the
first
couple
conferences
of
these
past
two
semesters
usually
do
not
involve
a
physical
paper,
other
than
the
standard
Writing
Center
worksheet.
I
believe
that
some
of
my
fondest
WA
moments
have
developed
in
the
course
of
these
two
semesters
because
each
conference
was
its
own
unique
experience.
Every
conference,
regardless
of
the
course,
should
be
tailored
to
the
student,
but
in
order
to
keep
the
meetings
productive,
I
have
established
a
flexible
four-conference
system
that
guides
my
students
and
I
toward
the
ultimate
goal
of
completing
a
satisfaction-worthy
twenty-page
paper
by
the
end
of
the
semester.
Conference
One:
the
student
comes
to
meet
me.
Maybe
he
brings
his
proposal,
maybe
he
has
forgotten.
My
role
is
not
to
help
him
revise
the
proposal
itself,
but
to
develop
his
initial
ideas
into
a
twenty-page
research
paper.
So
we
begin
talking.
I
feel
a
mixture
of
elation
and
relief
if
he
starts
talking
enthusiastically
without
my
help.
Interest
is
key;
like
my
VAST
professor
warned,
you
have
to
want
to
return
to
your
work
in
order
to
complete
the
paper.
And
with
this
lengthy
paper
in
particular,
you
have
four
months
of
revisions
to
look
forward
to.
The
conference,
however,
does
not
always
go
this
way.
In
fact,
more
often
then
not,
I
feel
that
a
major
part
of
my
role
as
a
WA
is
to
help
the
student
attain
a
level
of
enthusiasm
and
comfort
with
the
assignment
and
topic.
In
this
case,
my
partner
professor
asks
broadly
that
her
students
choose
a
topic
within
the
realm
of
the
Italian
Renaissance
and
write
a
twenty-page
paper.
When
they
come
to
see
me,
the
students
are
often
intimidated
by
several
realizations.
I
try
to
realign
my
perspective
to
put
myself
in
their
places.
Instinctively,
the
question
that
comes
to
mind
when
I
am
handed
a
new
writing
assignment
is
usually
Nhow
long
does
it
have
to
be?O
I
do
not
believe
that
I
have
ever
wondered
at
the
beginning,
Nhow
long
can
it
be?O
even
though
I
tend
to
write
verbosely.
In
their
shoes,
I
am
most
terrified
by
this
initial
stage,
as
well.
I
imagine
the
feeling
is
similar
to
the
knot
in
your
stomach
as
you
wait
for
the
signal
to
begin
a
marathon;
training
has
consisted
of
the
dozens
of
essays
I
have
written
and
rewritten
in
the
past
nine
years,
but
the
queasiness
is
the
result
of
the
twenty
page
stretch
of
open,
unwritten
road
ahead
of
me.
How
do
I
pace
myself,
how
do
I
keep
the
reader
and
myself
occupied?
So,
we
brainstorm.
It
is
casual
and
non-binding,
just
the
way
I
like
to
warm-up
before
signing
my
commitment
to
the
paper
by
typing
a
formal
sentence.
Over
the
past
three
years,
I
have
developed
a
fondness
for
brainstorming
on
blank
sheets
of
paper
so
that
I
can
record
physically
the
path
my
thoughts
take
in
an
informal
flow-chart.
I
often
take
this
approach
when
documenting
this
first
conference
on
the
conference
worksheet,
in
the
hopes
that
its
friendly
and
basic
appearance
will
make
the
paper
more
approachable.
I
tell
the
student
that
I
am
going
to
write
down
what
we
talk
about,
but
that
he
should
feel
free
to
take
notes
of
his
own.
I
definitely
learn
by
doing;
walking
away
from
a
half
an
hour
conference,
I
would
feel
much
more
confident
and
in
control
of
my
papers
if
I
had
actively
participated
in
the
recording
of
ideas.
As
an
art
history
major,
I
have
been
lucky
to
be
paired
with
an
art
history
class.
Yet,
while
I
probably
have
a
fundamental
knowledge
of
the
artist
or
theme
about
which
the
student
has
decided
to
write,
neither
of
us,
at
this
stage
in
the
process,
has
the
knowledge
and
research
to
discuss
details
of
the
topic
at
length.
Instead,
we
use
the
paperOs
structure
to
guide
our
conversation
about
the
paperOs
content.
For
instance,
the
professor
with
whom
I
have
worked
likes
her
students
to
introduce
the
topic
with
a
section
that
gives
the
reader
some
background
information
on
the
topic.
This
section
usually
causes
the
most
diverse
responses
from
students
because
in
one
sense,
it
seems
like
it
would
be
the
easiest
section
to
write;
the
information
seems
straightforward
and
undemanding
of
much
original
thought.
In
another
sense,
it
risks
attracting
too
much
information
that
becomes
irrelevant
in
the
developed
paper.
Sometimes
the
students
rely
on
it
as
a
comfort
because
the
idea
of
a
background
section
seems
to
allow
for
regurgitation
of
information.
I
try
to
discourage
this
particular
habit
from
the
first
conference
by
proposing
that
they
manipulate
this
portion
to
their
advantages.
For
instance,
the
reader
of
a
paper
about
LeonardoOs
attention
to
rock
formations
in
his
paintings
may
benefit
more
from
an
introduction
about
geological
study
in
the
Renaissance
and
LeonardoOs
own
investigations
than
a
brief
biography
on
LeonardoOs
life.
I
have
been
quite
impressed
by
the
authority
conveyed
through
the
resulting
specific
background
sections.
Before
I
am
given
completed
paragraphs,
however,
we
meet
for
Conference
Two.
With
the
structure
of
this
particular
course
and
writing
assignment,
the
second
conference
does
not
guarantee
me
a
draft
of
a
paper
to
read
and
discuss
with
the
student.
Instead,
I
receive
an
outline
if
I
am
lucky,
the
WA
worksheet
from
the
first
conference
if
I
am
not.
In
the
latter
situation,
I
usually
find
myself
conducting
a
conference
similar
to
that
first
meeting;
we
have
to
talk
for
about
half
an
hour
again
without
a
physical
source
of
discussion.
I
try
to
use
this
time
to
answer
questions
and
eliminate
the
anxieties
that
are
keeping
the
student
from
progressing
with
the
project.
I
still
recommend
that
the
student
create
an
outline
before
he
starts
writing
the
actual
paper
because
I
believe
it
will
save
him
time
and
energy
in
the
end.
When
I
write
papers
from
scratch
without
an
organized
plan
to
guide
my
thoughts,
I
usually
do
so
because
I
mistakenly
believe
that
I
know
exactly
what
I
want
to
write.
Predictably,
about
halfway
through,
I
am
forced
to
acknowledge
that
sickly,
sinking
feeling
that
I
am
writing
in
the
wrong
direction.
I
have
not
actually
hit
the
points
I
wanted
to
and
now
I
have
written
myself
into
a
wall
and
escape
is
not
an
easy
option.
In
some
unfortunate
cases,
I
have
had
to
sacrifice
some
of
my
favorite,
most
interesting
ideas
because
they
no
longer
belong
in
the
paper
and
I
have
not
left
myself
enough
time
to
rewrite
it.
A
proper
outline,
made
from
the
beginning,
not
only
guides
the
writing
to
a
logical
end,
but
also
makes
writing
the
essay
more
manageable.
All
of
the
steps
are
visible,
no
longer
conceptual,
and
the
motivation
to
write
and
to
return
to
the
project
is
stronger
because
there
are
points
to
check
off.
By
Conference
Three,
outlines
have,
in
most
cases,
led
to
a
few
pages
worth
of
writing.
Sometimes
the
paragraphs
are
incomplete,
sometimes
the
paragraphs
are
out
of
order,
but
the
piece
of
paper
is
no
longer
blank.
I
like
to
congratulate
the
students
on
this
accomplishment
because
for
me,
it
is
the
biggest
step
to
take.
We
work
with
what
they
have
written.
I
foster
a
fondness
for
analytical
writing,
and
I
find
that
the
majority
of
my
comments
after
reading
the
paper
ask
the
writers
to
elaborate
on
intriguing
statements
that
they
mention
briefly.
I
like
to
work
with
the
writers
to
find
the
potential
for
more
depth
and
complexity.
Hesitancy
does
arise,
however,
when
the
student
must
make
an
assertion
that
he
does
not
believe
he
is
qualified
educationally
to
make.
In
his
essay,
NInventing
the
University,O
David
Bartholomae
discusses
the
student
writerOs
relationship
with
the
scholars,
literature
and
general
conversation
related
to
the
subject
that
are
already
in
existence.
A
common
worry
among
my
students
is
that
they
do
not
have
the
right
credentials
or
enough
experience
to
be
adding
their
own
observations
and
claims
to
the
scholastic
sphere
of
art
history.
When
I
encounter
this
anxiety,
I
attempt
to
show
them
how
use
the
research
they
have
gathered,
the
information
that
they
take
to
be
true,
to
make
valid
arguments
about
the
artists
or
artworks
about
which
they
are
writing.
We
usually
do
this
by
closely
examining
one
of
the
pieces
of
artwork
about
which
the
student
is
writing,
or
some
of
the
facts
that
they
have
collected.
Past
this
key
point,
a
distinct
confidence
characterizes
their
papers,
and
by
the
sheer
increase
in
the
length
between
the
third
and
the
fourth
meetings,
I
can
tell
that
they
are
able
to
write
more
fluently.
Thus,
the
fastest
progress
occurs
in
preparation
for
Conference
Four.
From
the
beginning
of
the
process,
I
have
emphasized
that
the
more
the
students
complete
for
each
conference,
the
more
I
can
help
them
and
their
papers.
Ideally,
they
would
have
sent
me
about
ten
pages
for
the
third
conference
and
about
twenty
pages
for
the
fourth.
As
I
have
already
confided,
I
am
a
procrastinator.
So
when
I
receive
four
to
six
pages
for
the
third
and
fifteen
or
sixteen
for
the
fourth
conference,
I
cannot
be
disappointed
because
at
least
they
are
making
some
progress.
The
most
frustrating
fourth
conference
I
have
conducted
consisted
of
me
attempting
to
convince
a
student
that
he
needed
to
start
researching
immediately
if
he
was
going
to
hand
in
the
paper
on
time.
Because
Moodle
sign-ups
trust
the
students
to
sign
up
for
conferences
at
their
leisure,
there
have
been
students
during
both
semesters
that
do
not.
I
usually
email
them
up
to
two
times,
asking
that
they
sign
up.
If
they
do
not,
I
talk
to
the
partner
professor.
When
this
student
came
to
talk
to
me
for
the
second
time,
about
a
week
before
the
due
date,
I
experienced
more
anxiety
than
he
gave
the
impression
of
feeling.
He
brushed
off
my
advice
and
my
questions
concerning
his
plans
for
the
next
week,
and
I
left
the
conference
feeling
angry,
unsatisfied,
and
ultimately
quite
worried.
And
yet,
it
was
not
my
paper
that
he
still
had
to
write,
it
was
not
my
grade
and
relationship
with
the
professor
on
the
line.
On
the
few
occasions
like
these,
I
have
to
remind
myself
that
these
are
not
my
papers.
I
am
there
to
help
the
students,
not
to
be
them.
Because
I
have
the
privilege
of
witnessing
and
guiding
the
development
of
these
papers
from
their
very
conceptions,
I
experienced
a
much
stronger
connection
to
these
papers
than
I
did
to
the
shorter,
individual
assignments
of
my
partner
FYS.
During
the
last
week,
after
the
first
conference,
I
usually
find
myself
offering
to
read
any
papers
emailed
to
me
and
discuss
any
revisions
I
can
suggest.
For
my
sanity,
though,
it
is
imperative
that,
at
some
point,
I
let
go
and
trust
the
students
to
turn
in
what
has
become,
in
many
cases,
their
most
developed
and
valued
piece
of
writing.
The
most
rewarding
consequence
of
being
WA
is
definitely
the
connections
I
have
made
with
my
most
of
my
WA-ees.
At
one
point,
I
was
two
years
younger
than
the
seniors
in
the
class,
but
I
still
felt
like
a
proud
parent
when
I
saw
them
in
the
library
or
around
campus
after
they
had
turned
in
their
papers
at
the
end
of
the
term.
Together,
we
raised
a
paper;
if
they
are
proud
of
their
substantial
accomplishment,
I
am
a
satisfied
WA.
