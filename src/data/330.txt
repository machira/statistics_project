WA-
summer
writing
assignment
August

I
knew
that
the
packet
would
soon
arrive
in
the
mail,
but
I
tried
not
to
think
about
it.
I
also
knew
that
it
would
be
delivered
regardless
of
whether
or
not
I
thought
about
it.
Sure
enough
I
came
home
from
work
one
hot
afternoon
to
find
that
manila
rectangle
hanging
out
of
my
mailbox.
I
read
the
enclosed
materials
even
though
I
was
pretty
certain
what
I
needed
to
do.
As
I
sat
in
front
of
my
computer
to
write,
the
only
words
that
seemed
to
formulate
in
my
mind
were
questions
about
what
I
should
write
this
year.
The
first
year
I
was
given
this
assignment
I
had
a
clean
slate
for
writing
and
a
much
larger
span
of
my
writing
history
to
cover.
It
was
easy
to
get
seven
pages
out
of
the
twelve
plus
years
I
had
been
writing
since
the
first
grade.
As
I
enter
my
third
year
as
a
Writing
Associate
I
am
limited
to
writing
only
about
my
experiences
in
the
past
year.
How
much
could
my
writing
possibly
have
changed
in
the
past
year?
I
began
to
play
the
year
over
in
my
mind
and
that
is
when
I
realized
how
much
a
college
student
can
experience
in
one
year
to
change
his/her
life.
When
an
author's
life
is
altered
so
is
the
writing
he/she
produces.
Since
the
last
time
I
wrote
this
summer
assignment,
I
have
traveled
to
six
countries,
one
in
which
I
lived
for
four
months.
I
saw
sites
I
never
saw
before
and
situations
I
never
imagined.
I
believe
these
events
that
I
experienced
influenced
me
as
a
person
and
me
as
a
writer,
which
inevitably
changed
my
writing.
When
I
started
in
my
position
as
a
Writing
Associate
it
was
similar
to
being
in
a
foreign
country.
I
was
not
really
sure
what
was
expected
of
me
nor
what
to
expect
from
the
students.
I
wanted
to
come
up
with
the
best
way
to
communicate
with
them.
My
students
were
also
starting
something
new
as
Freshmen
in
the
foreign
environment
of
Lafayette
College.
Having
taken
the
same
First
Year
Seminar
when
I
was
a
Freshman,
I
was
able
to
provide
my
students
with
insightful
guidance
as
to
what
was
expected
of
them.
I
assisted
them
in
their
efforts
to
make
the
transition
from
the
five
paragraph
essay
drills
instituted
by
their
high
school
teachers
to
the
twenty
page
term
papers
assigned
by
their
college
professors.
My
own
experience
as
a
Freshman
at
Lafayette
College
effected
the
way
I
interacted
with
these
students
just
being
introduced
to
the
college
atmosphere
and
the
writing
program.
By
the
end
of
the
first
semester
I
was
much
more
comfortable
among
the
natives
in
319
Pardee
and
hopefully
my
students
adapted
to
their
new
setting
as
well.
The
fall
semester
of
the
following
year,
I
was
introduced
to
a
culture
much
more
foreign
to
this
Jersey
Shore
native
than
Lafayette
College
or
319
Pardee.
I
made
London
my
choice
for
my
study
abroad
destination
because
I
believed
that
this
would
prevent
the
burden
of
a
language
barrier.
Well,
this
is
what
I
believed
at
least
until
I
arrived
in
London
and
actually
began
communicating
with
the
inhabitants
who
were
apparently
speaking
in
the
tongue
from
which
our
language
derived.
But
suddenly
the
letters
u
and
z
were
appearing
in
words
where
they
had
never
been
before.
London's
spell
check
did
not
match
the
rules
of
grammar
that
had
been
monotonously
repeated
to
me
for
as
long
as
I
could
remember.
This
is
when
I
realized
that
everything
is
not
black
and
white
and
English
is
not
just
English.
People
have
their
own
style
they
apply
to
life
and
people
possess
their
own
unique
details
that
make
their
language,
their
life,
and
their
writing
their
own.
In
London,
we
all
spoke
English
only
each
of
us
added
our
own
twist
to
the
words
we
spoke.
The
same
pattern
occurs
when
a
student
receives
an
assignment
from
his/her
professor.
Each
student
in
the
class
receives
the
same
size
paper
with
the
same
size
font
in
black
ink.
The
words
that
each
of
them
read
follow
the
same
order
and
are
not
altered
in
anyway
apparent
to
an
outside
observer.
To
each
student
these
words
may
sound
the
same
spoken
out
loud;
however,
the
meaning
of
what
they
hear
varies
to
a
certain
extent
for
each
ear
that
listens.
My
experience
in
London
helped
me
to
understand
that
simply
because
something
looks
different
or
sounds
different
from
what
I
expect
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
it
is
wrong
or
that
it
must
be
changed.
I
took
this
new
knowledge
with
me
when
I
returned
to
the
United
States
and
319
Pardee
and
utilized
it
in
order
to
appreciate
the
individuality
of
each
paper
that
I
read
as
a
Writing
Associate.
Every
paper
I
read
is
slightly
different
from
the
one
previous.
People
have
different
ways
of
thinking
and
different
forms
of
expression
and
the
best
time
to
display
this
uniqueness
is
in
one's
own
writing.
I
was
lucky
that
when
I
returned
from
my
experience
abroad
I
was
assigned
to
a
class
that
allowed
the
students
to
express
this
spirit
of
freedom.
For
the
Spring
of
2001
my
assignment
for
the
Writing
Program
was
a
Baroque
Art
class.
The
students
in
this
class
were
expected
to
hand
in
one
twenty-page
paper
at
the
end
of
the
term.
This
assignment
consisted
of
general
guidelines
but
each
student
approached
the
subject
of
art
in
a
different
way.
The
results
of
their
final
project
were
a
product
of
their
previous
exposure
to
art
and
the
various
events
that
have
occurred
in
their
lives.
Some
came
from
religious
backgrounds
so
their
focus
was
on
the
paintings
that
depicted
Mary
and
the
baby
Jesus.
Others
were
more
interested
in
architecture
and
the
structures
of
the
buildings.
Still
some
found
a
much
greater
interest
focusing
on
the
lives
of
the
artists,
rather
than
the
work
itself.
Perhaps
these
students
were
following
the
same
idea
that
I
had
about
authors,
which
states
that
the
outcome
of
an
artist's
work
is
greatly
influenced
by
his/her
own
life
experiences.
The
most
common
question
I
was
asked
by
the
students
in
this
class
was,
Are
you
an
Art
History
major?
My
response
to
them
was
that
I
have
never
even
taken
an
Art
History
class
at
Lafayette
College,
nor
anywhere
for
that
matter.
I
think
this
caused
some
of
the
students
to
be
nervous
at
first.
Many
probably
wondered
how
I
could
possibly
help
them
if
I
had
never
even
taken
a
class
similar
to
the
one
they
were
writing
for.
How
could
I
possibly
know
what
they
were
talking
about
in
their
papers?
How
could
I
tell
them
what
they
have
neglected
to
address
when
I
do
not
even
understand
what
they
are
addressing
in
the
first
place?
Just
as
I
assumed
there
would
be
no
language
barrier
in
London,
these
students
assumed
that
a
barrier
existed
between
them
and
myself
because
of
my
lack
of
lessons
in
Art
History.
Neither
one
of
these
assumptions
was
correct.
I
may
not
have
any
formal
credits
for
studying
art;
however,
in
my
travels
around
Europe
I
learned
about
many
of
the
artworks
that
these
students
were
reading
about.
What
they
were
looking
at
as
a
two
dimensional
copy
at
their
desk,
I
had
seen
in
its
original
form,
vibrant
and
alive-
the
way
the
artist
had
intended
it.
My
travel
experience
allowed
me
to
grasp
an
understanding
of
what
these
masterpieces
actually
looked
like
and
the
places
from
which
they
drew
their
inspiration.
I
had
the
privilege
of
looking
at
the
same
structures
in
person;
perhaps
I
even
stood
in
the
same
location
where
that
artist
may
have
placed
his
easel.
The
events
that
occur
in
life
are
the
inspiration
that
effects
each
person's
art.
Whether
we
are
using
words
or
paint,
our
work
exhibits
who
we
are.
My
view
in
a
museum
in
Paris
is
different
from
the
point
of
view
of
someone
looking
at
a
postcard
copy
of
the
same
picture.
Neither
one
is
better
than
the
other,
simply
different.
My
paper
would
be
very
different
from
someone
who
has
never
been
to
Europe
or
someone
not
interested
in
art
at
all.
My
paper
would
also
be
different
even
from
someone
that
has
been
to
Europe
and
is
interested
in
art
as
well.
Every
view
is
interpreted
differently,
even
when
people
are
standing
in
the
same
position.
I
have
come
to
appreciate
this
idea
and
I
believe
it
has
helped
me
as
a
Writing
Associate
because
I
understand
that
no
two
people
write
the
same.
Some
may
be
similar
in
their
style,
but
no
one
writes
exactly
like
another
person
simply
because
of
the
different
lives
that
they
live.
Even
this
assignment
I
am
sure
will
develop
a
wide
range
of
different
responses
from
the
various
Writing
Associates
who
received
it.
Before
I
was
asked
to
reflect
on
my
writing
history
over
the
past
year,
I
did
not
realize
how
much
I
actually
have
changed
in
the
way
I
read
papers
and
what
I
am
able
to
now
contribute
to
my
writing.
I
knew
that
my
study
abroad
experience
had
changed
my
life
forever
in
ways
that
were
obvious,
but
I
did
not
fully
understand
the
extent
to
which
I
was
effected
until
I
began
writing
this
paper.
In
America
we
write
color
while
in
England
they
write
colour,
but
both
refer
to
the
same
subject.
I
have
not
changed
the
way
I
spell
my
words
but
I
have
changed
the
way
I
read
the
words
of
others.
I
now
know
that
there
is
more
than
one
way
of
saying/spelling
a
word
and
it
does
not
mean
that
either
one
is
correct
over
the
other.
As
a
Writing
Associate
this
coming
semester,
I
hope
to
continue
this
approach
to
the
papers
I
will
be
receiving.
I
was
assigned
a
First
Year
Seminar
that
follows
an
art
curriculum.
Hopefully
freedom
of
expression
will
be
emphasized
in
the
classroom
and
these
students
will
be
able
to
acclimate
to
their
new
environment
while
adding
a
piece
of
themselves
to
the
community
as
well.
I
hope
as
a
native
of
the
Lafayette
College
community,
I
am
able
to
show
them
something
similar
to
what
the
native
Londoners
showed
me.
