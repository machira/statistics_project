My
writing
experience
over
the
last
yearNa
period
when
I
took
two
creative
writing
courses
and
spent
two
semesters
as
a
writing
assistantNdrove
home
a
lesson
I
had
previously
only
guessed
at.
Perhaps
paradoxically
(for
a
writing
associate),
I
concluded
that
writing
takes
a
back
seat
to
thinking.
As
the
new
writing
associates
prepares
for
their
meetings
with
students,
they
are
probably
thinking
that
they
will
need
to
keep
a
sharp
eye
out
for
dangling
participles,
subject-verb
agreement,
strong
topic
sentences
and
other
basics
of
competent
writing
that
many
Lafayette
students
have
yet
to
master.
I
have
one
message
for
them:
the
fundamental
problem
among
the
students
whom
WAs
meet
with
is
not
an
inability
to
write
clearly
or
even
competently,
let
alone
with
any
kind
of
style
or
flair.
The
real
problem
is
a
lack
of
clear
thinking,
something
that
no
amount
of
stylish
writing
can
overcome
or
even
hide.
True,
in
some
cases
brilliant
writing
can
camouflage
shoddy
thinking,
or
even
obscure
evil
thinking.
ThatOs
what
demagogues
thrive
on,
after
all.
There
are
tricks
such
as
evoking
readersO
emotions
rather
than
their
rational
capabilities
when
a
writer
wishes
to
persuade
his
or
her
audience
of
some
point.
But
few
college
students
have
this
kind
of
writing
talent
(at
least,
those
seeking
the
assistance
of
a
WA
do
not
seem
to
have
it).
As
a
result,
when
a
student
is
beset
by
poor
thinking,
the
writing
suffers.
But
NfixingO
the
writing
will
not
repair
the
shoddy
thinking.
Over
the
last
year,
this
is
what
I
realized
more
clearly
than
I
ever
had
before.
If
there
was
a
single
formative
moment
for
me,
it
came
early
in
the
first
semester
of
2008,
during
one
of
my
first
meetings
as
a
WA
with
a
student.
He
had
a
paper
due
for
his
first
year
seminar,
NThe
Uses
and
Abuses
of
Science,O
and
the
assignment
was
something
about
the
scientific
plausibility
of
Star
Trek.
The
paper
was
quite
a
mess,
in
that
it
rambled,
repeated
points
and
had
(what
I
soon
learned
were)
all-too-common
errors
of
syntax.
The
fact
that
it
lacked
style
and
voice
was
something
I
would
become
used
to
and
not
even
attempt
to
fix.
I
proceeded
as
I
always
did
for
a
writing
conference,
noting
places
where
such
problems
appeared.
The
student
and
I
went
through
them
all
methodically.
As
we
did,
and
as
the
student
struggled
to
see
what
was
wrong
with
the
sentences
or
paragraphs
that
I
pointed
out
to
him,
all
of
these
problems
were
fixed,
one
by
one.
We
were
getting
to
the
end
of
the
paper,
and
the
time
for
the
big
conclusion.
As
the
student
thought
about
how
to
strengthen
the
conclusion,
I
glanced
back
up
at
all
the
corrections
we
had
made,
and
thatOs
when
it
hit
me.
Even
if
the
student
included
all
of
these
corrections
in
the
next
draft
of
the
paper,
it
would
still
be
crap.
By
going
over
the
paper
word
by
word
and
sentence
by
sentence,
I
had
missed
the
big
pictureNand
the
big
problem:
the
student
could
not
think.
And
his
writing
reflected
that.
So
instead
of
making
suggestions
about
these
smaller
points,
I
asked
the
student,
Nokay,
what
is
the
question
asking?O
He
told
me.
I
then
asked,
NSo
whatOs
the
answer
to
that
question?O
To
which
he
replied,
NUh
.
.
.
,O
followed
by
a
rambling
discourse
that
did
not,
in
fact,
answer
the
question.
Then
I
asked,
NHow
does
this
argument
[and
I
pointed
to
a
few
paragraphs]
tie
back
into
your
main
argument?O
More
rambling.
NWhat
exactly
are
you
trying
to
argue
here?O
It
became
clear
that
the
problem
was
not
writing,
it
was
thinking.
Yes,
in
some
cases
a
student
will
indeed
know
the
answer
to
a
question,
in
the
sense
of
having
something
thoughtful
to
say
about
the
themes
of
Hamlet
or
the
causes
of
the
genocide
in
Darfur
or
the
morality
of
human
cloning,
but
be
hindered
by
an
inability
to
express
himself
coherently.
This
happened
a
few
times
during
my
WA
conferences,
when
a
student
whose
paper
I
found
to
be
borderline
incoherent
actually
was
able
to
say
something
intelligent
on
the
subject
when
I
asked
the
questions
above.
But
thatNknowing
what
to
say
but
being
unable
to
say
it,
which
is
a
purely
writing
problemNwas
the
exception
and
not
the
rule.
After
my
first
experience
of
this,
the
first
thing
I
honed
in
on
with
students
was
whether
they
were
able
to
think,
when
it
came
to
answering
the
question
in
the
assignment.
Only
once
we
got
over
that
hurdle
was
it
possible
to
help
them
write
better.
This
turned
out
to
be
a
fairly
important
turning
point
in
my
writing
history.
When
I
applied
to
be
a
writing
assistant,
it
was
in
the
belief
that
writing
is
important,
indeed,
very
important.
I
still
believe
that,
but
with
an
asterisk
now:
writing
is
important,
but
it
takes
a
back
seat
to
thinking.
As
I
turned
this
over
in
my
mind,
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
authors
we
consider
great
writers,
whether
of
fiction
or
of
non-fiction,
are
thought
of
that
way
because
of
their
thoughts
as
much
as,
or
perhaps
more
than,
because
of
their
styleNthat
is,
their
writing.
It
seems
odd
to
say
that
the
most
important
talent
of
a
NwriterO
is
not
writing,
but
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
realizations
I
came
to
this
past
year.
For
instance,
Faulkner
won
the
Nobel
Prize
in
literature
because
of
his
insights
into
the
American
SouthOs
legacy
of
race.
Of
course
his
writing
is
lyrical,
but
if
he
had
lacked
anything
interesting
to
say
about
race
and
the
South,
he
would
be
just
another
wordsmith.
This
is
true
in
nonfiction
as
well.
Great
biographers
of
course
present
their
subjectOs
life
in
an
organized,
clear
way.
But
if
they
did
not
have
any
interesting
psychological
insights
into
their
subject,
for
instance,
the
biography
would
be
little
more
than
a
longer
version
of
a
Wikipedia
entry.
This
has
shown
me
that
writing
associate
would
do
well
to
not
lose
sight
of
the
forest
due
to
their
focus
on
the
trees.
If
the
student
comes
to
a
WA
meeting
with
a
problematic
paper,
itOs
a
good
idea
to
take
a
step
back
and
see
whether
the
thinking
is
clear
and
interesting,
and
whether
the
essay
answers
the
assigned
question.
If
not,
all
the
grammar
corrections
in
the
world
will
not
turn
it
into
a
good
paper.
As
an
aside,
I
should
add
that
it
is
a
lot
easier
to
correct
grammar,
syntax,
topic
sentences
and
even
organization
than
it
is
to
fix
a
lack
of
clear
thinking.
Because
of
this
experience,
my
WA-work
came
into
clearer
focus,
causing
me
to
first
make
sure
that
the
student
had
a
thoughtNsimplistically,
an
answer
to
the
assignmentOs
questionNbefore
I
began
working
with
him
or
her
on
the
nuts
and
bolts
of
writing.
Since
I
came
to
this
conclusion
about
the
precedence
of
thinking
over
writing
in
the
first
semester,
it
came
into
play
during
my
own
coursework
as
well.
It
had
long
been
my
habit,
when
writing
a
paper,
to
just
plunge
inNwith
a
vague
idea
of
what
I
wanted
to
sayNand
start
writing.
After
my
realization
about
the
relative
importance
of
thinking
and
writing,
I
began
to
approach
assignments
differently,
adopting
a
new
writing
process.
This
proved
to
be
beneficial
in
one
case,
though
not
at
first
glance.
I
was
taking
Literary
Questions.
Although
supposedly
a
writing
courseNwhich
interested
me
in
part
because
my
minor
is
writingNthis
is
what
I
now
think
of
as
a
thinking
course.
Obviously
all
academics
involve
thinking,
so
this
may
seem
to
be
stating
the
obvious,
but
the
course
was
really
about
analyzing
literature.
To
my
mind,
however,
it
amounted
to
overanalyzing,
and
actually
ruined
the
reading
experience
for
me.
I
wound
up
dropping
the
course.
But
before
I
did,
I
completed
a
few
assignments.
Most
of
these
were
due
soon
after
my
epiphany
about
writing
and
thinking,
and
I
was
paralyzed:
I
had
just
seen
how
the
lack
of
good,
clear
thinking
cannot
be
obscured
by
competent
writing,
and
now
here
I
was,
with
what
I
thought
was
nothing
meaningful
to
say
about
various
literary
works.
So
I
would
write
a
clear
essay,
inserting
quotes
from
the
book
to
(supposedly)
support
my
argument,
organizing
it
in
standard
(if
not
exactly
original)
first
paragraph
stating
the
points
I
intended
to
make,
a
few
more
paragraphs
making
those
points,
and
a
concluding
paragraph
restating
what
I
had
just
said.
I
make
allusions
to
a
few
critics
who
had
analyzed
the
workNall
the
usual
things
for
a
literary,
expository
essay.
I
was
doing
fine
in
the
class,
but
I
hated
the
whole
experience.
I
knew
in
my
heart
that
I
had
not
had
anything
especially
brilliant
to
say
about
anything,
and
the
fact
that
I
had
been
able
to
cover
that
up
with
stylish
writing
that
followed
all
the
rules
made
me
cynical
about
the
whole
enterprise.
Now
I
had
to
revise
my
hypothesis.
As
a
general
rule,
a
lack
of
thinking
cannot
be
hidden
by
writing.
But
good
writing
can
be
distracting
enough
to
obscure
the
fact
that
the
thinking
is
only
so-so.
Still,
I
felt
like
a
fraud,
and
dropped
the
course.
This
may
seem
like
a
disadvantageous
outcome
from
my
insight,
but
I
regard
it
as
putting
the
insight
into
practice,
and
not
being
willing
to
use
writing
in
the
service
of
a
fraud.
Plus,
the
class
was
pretty
boring.
This
helped
me
establish,
in
my
own
mind,
my
NidentityO
as
a
writer.
I
used
to
use
many
more
flourishes
and
stylistic
tricksNand
tricks
is
how
I
now
viewed
them.
From
now
on,
I
was
going
to
focus,
in
my
non-fiction
and
expository
writing,
on
clarity
and
persuasive
thought,
not
on
style.
Obviously
I
was
going
to
adhere
to
the
basic
rules
of
grammar,
syntax
and
all
the
rest,
but
I
was
not
going
to
let
myself
paper
over
sloppy
thinking
with
fancy
writing.
I
had
a
very
different
experience
in
the
two
other
writing
courses
I
took
last
year:
creative
writing
and
advanced
creative
writing.
The
neat
thing
about
these
classes
was
that
we
did
these
workshops,
where
everyone
would
bring
in
their
short
story
and
we
would
spend
about
a
half
hour
talking
about
what
worked
in
the
story,
what
didnOt
work,
what
the
author
should
do
in
the
revisionNall
as
the
author
listened
quietly.
In
the
case
of
creative
writing,
the
writing
itself
overshadows
the
substance
of
the
thinking.
Again,
there
has
to
be
some
thought
in
a
piece
of
creative
writing,
but
itOs
of
a
different
type
than
in
an
expository
essay.
Yes,
in
theory
there
is
no
NwrongO
answer
to
a
question
such
as
analyzing
The
Scarlet
Letter,
but
letOs
face
it:
some
answers
are
more
convincing
than
others.
In
creative
writing,
I
saw,
the
writing
assumes
greater
importance.
The
creative
writing
workshops
benefitted
me
in
another
way.
By
critiquing
the
work
of
others
and
by
being
critiques
in
turn,
I
learned
a
good
deal
about
what
readers
look
for
in
a
piece
of
writing,,
what
works
and
what
doesnOtNall
things
that
I
then
applied
to
my
WA
work.
For
instance,
it
is
more
effective,
when
critiquing
someoneOs
work,
to
explain
what
would
make
something
more
clear
than
to
simply
declare
it
confusing.
This
was
the
basis
for
some
of
the
NauthorityO
I
drew
on
to
help
my
WA
students.
That
is,
I
did
with
them
what
my
classmates
had
done
with
me
in
the
creative
writing
workshops.
And
I
tried
to
get
them
to
put
thinking
before
writing,
and
not
to
be
frauds.
My
previous
summer
experiences
played
little
to
no
role
in
my
NwriterOs
history,O
but
the
summer
of
2009
did.
I
worked
as
an
intern
at
the
Kauffman
Foundation,
doing
data
analysis
and
statistics
to
support
papers
and
speeches
that
the
foundation
associates
were
writing.
The
subjects
were
generally
related
to
entrepreneurship;
for
instance,
do
immigrants
create
more
jobs
than
native-born
Americans
do?
What
attributes
of
new
companies
are
most
conducive
to
growth?
Obviously
stylistic
tricks
had
no
place
here.
It
was
data,
and
data
only.
When
the
officers
used
my
analyses
in
their
papers,
I
saw
again
the
power
of
factNand
of
thinking:
either
the
data
made
an
interesting
and
important
point
or
it
didnOt.
As
I
begin
this
academic
year,
my
last
at
Lafayette,
I
intend
to
put
the
above
into
practice
in
my
own
writing
as
well
as
in
my
WA
work.
Before
I
get
distracted
by
an
essayOs
writing
problems,
I
plan
to
ask
the
student
to
answer
the
assignment
question
in
a
few
sentences.
That,
I
hope,
should
bring
out
whether
the
problem
is
in
writing
or
thinking.
