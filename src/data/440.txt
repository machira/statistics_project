The
Story
of
a
Writer
My
first
acknowledged
writing
experience
occurred
when
I
was
only
two
and
a
half
years
old.
After
watching
my
older
sisters
use
a
chair
to
climb
to
our
cabinet
with
the
cups
in
it,
I
decided
to
try
the
climb
myself.
Upon
reaching
the
cabinet,
I
decided
to
attempt
another
action
of
my
sistersO:
writing.
I
picked
up
an
indelible
black
marker
and
neatly
scribbled
on
every
one
of
my
motherOs
Tupperware
cups.
Perhaps
it
was
not
my
greatest
work,
but
we
still
have
the
cups
today
labeled
as
my
own.
I
would
not
recall
this
if
it
was
not
for
the
evidence,
which
is
the
case
for
most
of
my
early
writing
experiences.
One
of
the
early
writing
experiences
I
recall
was
in
the
third
grade
when
I
debuted
with
my
first
novel,
SallyOs
Birthday.
I
was
responsible
for
coming
up
with
an
idea
for
a
story,
and
then
developing
it
into
a
plot.
I
chose
to
write
about
a
little
girl
wanting
a
puppy
for
her
birthday.
Each
day
in
school
I
used
a
pencil
and
paper
to
write
a
page
of
the
book
with
individual
help
from
the
teacher.
While
in
the
process
of
creating
this
story,
the
teacher
and
the
school
librarian
taught
the
class
about
authors,
illustrators,
and
the
structure
of
books.
Learning
these
lessons
and
writing
the
story
were
the
root
of
my
ability
to
write.
As
a
third
grader,
the
most
exciting
part
of
this
project
was
the
fact
that
we
wrote
it
in
a
NrealO
hardback
book.
As
author
I
prided
myself
in
my
ability
to
incorporate
birthdays,
puppies,
and
little
girls
all
within
one
story.
As
illustrator,
I
esteemed
my
capability
to
have
colorful
pages
and
several
fashionable
pink
dresses
for
Sally.
My
third
grade
teacher
was
very
encouraging
making
writing
fun
and
setting
a
decent
tone
for
my
views
on
writing.
SallyOs
Birthday
received
raving
reviews
from
my
parents
and
grandparents,
which
sealed
this
experience
as
a
positive
background
for
future
writing
attempts.
When
I
read
the
story
today,
I
laugh
at
the
simplicity
of
it,
but
my
parents
still
keep
it
on
the
shelf
with
their
other
favorite
reads.
The
next
memorable
occasion
in
my
writing
career
was
in
fifth
grade
when
I
was
again
assigned
to
create
a
story.
This
time
the
assignment
was
a
bit
more
complex
because
it
incorporated
research
into
writing
a
narrative.
My
book,
Travels
with
Trish,
was
a
series
of
postcards
written
to
my
best
friend
as
my
family
traveled
through
several
states
across
the
country.
The
postcards
included
factual
information
about
the
states
as
well
fictional
remarks
about
how
my
family
interacted
on
vacation.
This
writing
project
was
more
independent
than
any
of
my
previous
writing
attempts
because
my
teacher
simply
proofread
it
as
opposed
to
assisting
me
with
the
writing.
When
completed,
Travels
with
had
a
shiny
laminated
cover,
but
to
me
this
did
not
compare
in
the
least
to
the
hardbound
cover
of
SallyOs
Birthday.
Upon
completing
Travels
with
Trish,
I
felt
that
it
was
rather
lengthy
and
therefore
not
one
of
my
best
works.
However,
my
family
again
commended
and
whether
the
praise
was
due
to
worthy
material
or
simply
kindness,
I
continued
to
feel
assured
in
my
writing.
As
shown
in
the
two
previously
mentioned
examples,
my
family
provided
a
great
deal
of
positive
reinforcement
throughout
my
early
writing
years.
The
repeated
positive
response
instilled
in
me
a
confident
attitude
enabling
me
to
approach
writing
as
a
simple
and
attainable
task.
Throughout
my
primary
education
I
never
felt
any
qualms
and
was
eager
to
explore
any
writing
assignments.
The
assignments
I
faced
were
never
too
difficult
which
seems
to
be
due
to
a
lack
of
high
expectations
from
teachers.
Most
of
the
teachers
I
had
in
those
early
years
focused
on
correct
grammar
as
opposed
to
any
type
of
style
or
technique.
In
the
sixth
grade
my
writing
broadened
to
include
several
genres.
One
of
my
major
writing
exploits
was
a
letter
of
complaint
to
send
to
an
actual
company.
I
wrote
to
a
hotel
that
my
family
had
stayed
at
where
we
were
dissatisfied
with
the
service
and
hospitality
throughout
our
stay.
This
writing
assignment
was
significant
because
it
made
me
feel
like
a
mature
writer
with
a
purpose.
Before
the
letter
was
mailed,
my
teacher
read
it
and
told
me
that
my
writing
did
not
sound
formal
enough.
At
first
I
struggled
with
this
because
I
did
not
understand
her
meaning.
She
explained
that
I
was
writing
as
if
I
were
speaking
which
is
incorrect
when
writing
a
formal
piece,
such
as
a
complaint
letter.
Receiving
a
letter
of
apology
from
the
hotel
in
response
to
my
letter
sealed
the
experience
as
a
success.
During
the
second
half
of
sixth
grade,
I
was
introduced
to
my
favorite
writing
genre:
poetry.
My
stern
yet
inspiring
teacher
described
it
as
free
expression
of
emotion
that
has
no
boundaries.
Ironically,
we
spent
a
month
trying
to
create
Haiku,
Tanka,
sonnets,
and
other
quaint
rhyming
poems
by
following
her
guidelines.
Despite
this
regimented
introduction,
I
felt
a
spark
when
it
came
to
poetry.
The
basic
concept
of
using
words
to
make
art
that
can
convey
palpable
emotion
drew
me
towards
it.
This
generic
unit
of
sixth
grade
language
arts
led
to
the
personal
writing,
as
in
outside
of
school,
that
I
would
pursue
throughout
the
future.
As
for
the
actual
poetry
I
wrote
during
this
unit,
the
only
poem
notable
enough
to
recall
was
one
I
wrote
about
my
grandmother.
Although
this
piece
was
filled
with
forced
rhyme,
I
was
proud
of
it
because
it
managed
to
express
my
love
for
my
grandmother.
The
reaction
I
received
from
my
teacher
was
that
all
of
my
poems
tended
to
depend
upon
forced
rhyme.
At
this
point
I
had
not
yet
figured
out
that
rhyming
is
not
essential
for
a
poem
to
be
high-quality
and
therefore
I
did
not
see
the
need
to
seriously
regard
my
teacherOs
remarks.
I
am
grateful
for
the
trend
in
the
English
department
of
my
junior
high
school
to
have
students
create
annual
poetry
books.
Because
of
this
exposure
to
poetry,
two
important
things
occurred.
First,
I
did
not
ascertain
the
common
problem
of
stereotyping
poetry
as
boring
or
incomprehensible.
Secondly,
my
skills
as
a
poet
eventually
improved,
or
at
least
I
managed
to
stop
rhyming
every
poem.
The
poems
that
I
wrote
in
seventh
grade
were
strictly
by
assignment,
but
by
eighth
grade,
I
began
experimenting
with
poetry
outside
of
the
classroom.
I
realized
that
the
poems
I
wrote
were
all
quite
simple,
and
this
led
to
my
private
attitude
concerning
my
poetry.
The
only
poems
I
shared
with
anyone
were
ones
that
I
used
for
school
assignments.
At
this
time,
I
also
began
keeping
a
daily
journal
because
I
enjoyed
writing.
My
journal
was
an
outlet
for
the
pressures
of
junior
high,
which
at
the
time
seem
like
life-altering
experiences.
Both
poetry
and
my
journal
are
still
the
main
components
of
my
personal
writing.
In
ninth
grade,
I
learned
the
five
paragraph
technique
that
was
the
basis
for
everything
that
I
went
on
to
write
in
high
school.
Every
essay
and
book
report
I
wrote
had
an
introduction,
three
body
paragraphs,
and
a
conclusion.
Although
perhaps
too
structured,
the
method
served
me
well
for
my
high
school
assignments
because
they
were
mostly
informative
pieces
requiring
an
intro
and
conclusion.
The
first
paper
I
wrote
for
my
ninth
grade
English
teacher
after
learning
this
technique
was
an
essay
about
the
ozone
layer.
My
teacherOs
feedback
was
that
the
use
of
the
five
paragraphs
was
a
drastic
improvement.
She
told
me
that
the
essayOs
organization
made
my
writing
comprehendible.
My
reaction
to
this
comment
was
confusion
that
my
teacher
seemed
to
have
thought
my
writing
disorganized
in
the
first
place.
However,
because
she
had
good
things
to
say
now,
it
simply
increased
my
opinion
of
following
a
five
paragraph
outline.
I
liked
this
method
because
it
reminded
me
of
plugging
numbers
into
an
equation
except
with
words.
Making
this
type
of
connection
between
math
and
writing
made
sense
to
me
because
I
generally
favored
mathematical
situations.
At
the
end
of
ninth
grade,
we
compiled
our
writing
assignments
into
a
portfolio
and
were
required
to
write
a
self-evaluation.
I
remember
reading
an
essay
on
giraffes
from
the
end
of
the
year
right
after
reading
one
about
The
Red
Badge
of
Courage
that
I
had
written
in
the
beginning
of
the
year.
The
difference
was
noticeable
even
to
me
because
the
giraffe
essay
was
simply
much
easier
to
read
because
of
the
improvement
in
my
writing
style.
The
next
prominent
writing
experience
in
my
memory
was
my
tenth
grade
research
project.
This
assignment
was
an
extended
research/writing
project
that
would
require
a
few
months.
I
was
allowed
to
write
about
any
topic
I
wanted
as
long
as
I
had
enough
to
say
about
it
to
fill
fifteen
to
twenty
pages.
This
was
longer
than
any
paper
I
had
written,
and
I
was
awfully
intimidated.
Not
only
was
it
supposed
to
be
a
long
paper,
but
it
was
also
supposed
to
include
properly
cited
research
and
was
worth
a
fifth
of
my
overall
English
grade.
So
when
it
came
time
to
pick
a
topic,
I
was
nervous
that
halfway
through
my
assignment
I
would
regret
my
choice.
My
English
teacher
realized
how
concerned
I
was
and
guided
me
by
explaining
that
I
should
view
this
paper
as
being
for
my
own
benefit.
It
was
an
opportunity
to
learn
about
anything
I
found
interesting,
and
then
all
I
had
to
do
was
write
about
it.
I
realized
that
usually
I
tried
to
write
what
the
teacher
wanted
me
to
be
writing,
and
since
I
do
not
read
minds,
writing
for
my
self
made
more
sense.
I
was
finally
able
to
choose
a
topic
that
would
keep
my
interest
by
making
it
relate
to
my
dream
profession,
medicine.
I
considered
researching
various
medicines
such
as
antibiotics,
and
I
eventually
narrowed
my
focus
to
the
nontraditional
herbal
medicines.
After
completing
the
necessary
research
during
numerous
class
periods,
we
began
the
second
stage
of
the
assignment:
outlining.
Trying
to
organize
a
paper
of
this
size
seemed
to
be
quite
a
task.
My
research
covered
a
large
realm
of
information
and
not
all
of
the
notes
I
had
directly
connected
to
one
another.
Fortunately,
my
teacher
again
helped
me
by
suggesting
I
spread
all
of
my
notes
and
research
across
the
floor
in
front
of
me.
By
doing
this
I
was
able
to
group
the
information
into
general
piles.
From
here
I
broke
down
the
piles
into
more
specific
clusters
and
discarded
the
information
that
did
not
seem
significantly
related.
This
process
enabled
me
to
turn
an
excessive
amount
of
information
into
an
outline
for
a
paper.
I
began
to
appreciate
the
necessity
of
making
an
outline
prior
to
writing
a
paper
because
even
if
it
is
not
a
very
thorough
outline,
it
at
least
gives
the
paper
a
general
direction.
From
writing
this
paper
I
learned
several
lessons
that
I
still
use
in
current
writing
endeavors.
Firstly,
I
learned
that
when
writing
a
research
paper,
it
is
often
useful
to
pose
a
question
for
the
paper
to
focus
on
answering.
My
question
was
NHow
effective
are
herbal
medicines?O
and
I
then
developed
my
thesis
from
this
question.
The
second
lesson
deals
directly
with
the
question
and
thesis.
I
learned
that
when
a
paper
focuses
on
a
specific
question,
it
is
best
to
pick
a
side
and
work
on
accurately
proving
it.
I
attempted
to
prove
that
herbal
medicines
are
in
fact
effective.
In
my
paper,
however,
I
had
a
section
dealing
with
the
reasons
why
herbal
medicines
may
be
considered
ineffective.
By
rebutting
the
opposite
side
of
the
issue,
it
furthered
my
argument.
The
third
lesson
from
this
writing
experience
was
how
to
properly
use
in-text
citations.
Before
this
point,
I
had
not
used
citations
so
the
idea
was
foreign
to
me.
This
was
the
first
time
that
a
teacher
stressed
to
me
that
plagiarism
is
a
big
deal.
My
English
teacher
constantly
lectured
on
the
importance
of
citing
research
and
told
horror
stories
of
Nstraight-AO
students
being
expelled
from
college
because
of
plagiarism.
When
my
paper
was
finally
finished,
I
was
pleased
with
the
simple
fact
that
I
had
managed
to
complete
it.
By
the
time
I
was
starting
my
senior
year
of
high
school,
I
was
suitable
confident
in
my
writing.
That
is
why
it
was
such
a
shock
when
I
got
a
B-
on
my
first
English
paper.
As
it
turns
out
my
teacher
was
pretty
demanding
and
my
usual
minimal
effort
was
not
nearly
enough
to
meet
his
standards.
The
first
half
of
my
senior
English
course
was
spent
learning
to
write
and
then
rewrite
better
drafts
for
my
assignments.
The
assignments
from
this
course
also
introduced
variety
into
my
writing
such
as
writing
my
own
Canterbury
tale,
a
literary
analysis,
poetry,
and
classic
and
modern
poetry
explication.
Of
these
pieces,
the
literary
analysis
was
my
favorite
because
it
tied
writing
to
my
love
for
reading.
This
assignment
was
my
first
inkling
that
I
might
want
to
pursue
writing
and
literature
in
college.
Out
of
the
various
assignments,
the
other
most
useful
were
the
poetry
ones.
Explicating
ShakespeareOs
sonnets
was
not
easy,
but
after
having
to
do
it
fifteen
times,
I
was
much
more
skilled
at
explicating
poems
and
therefore
valued
the
experience.
After
such
a
challenging
English
course
in
my
senior
year
of
high
school,
I
was
not
too
concerned
about
transitioning
to
Ncollege
writing.O
I
would
not
describe
my
freshman
year
writing
experiences
as
extremely
horrible,
but
it
was
a
slight
surprise
when
my
five
paragraph
structure
standby
was
rejected.
Throughout
my
First
Year
Seminar,
I
struggled
to
wean
myself
from
the
dependency
on
that
method.
My
first
essay
was
returned
to
me
with
a
comment
from
my
professor
saying
that
a
conclusion
paragraph
was
not
necessary.
This
was
the
start
of
a
struggle
that
I
have
yet
to
master:
ending
papers.
I
understood
that
not
all
essays
need
a
concluding
paragraph,
but
this
seemed
to
only
increase
my
difficulties
in
creating
some
type
of
closure
in
a
paper.
When
a
paragraph
was
required,
I
feared
sounding
repetitive.
When
a
paragraph
was
not
required,
I
felt
that
my
paper
was
left
hanging
open
at
the
end.
My
professor
was
helpful
because
in
each
writing
assignment
he
would
critique
my
ending.
Then
when
writing
the
next
paper,
I
would
reread
his
previous
comments
to
aid
me
in
ending
my
current
paper.
The
fact
that
I
realized
my
conclusions
needed
work
was
important
because
then
I
would
make
a
point
of
working
on
the
endings
of
every
paper.
Even
now
I
am
struggling
to
form
an
ending
for
this
narrative,
but
reflecting
on
the
previous
seven
pages
is
helpful.
My
writing
has
definitely
come
a
long
way
from
ruining
my
motherOs
Tupperware
cups,
but
I
did
not
understand
how
until
working
on
this
paper.
Every
time
I
wrote
something,
my
writing
would
improve
in
some
way
whether
it
was
because
of
othersO
responses
or
my
own.
There
will
always
be
room
for
improvement
in
my
writing
no
matter
how
superior
or
experienced
I
may
feel.
