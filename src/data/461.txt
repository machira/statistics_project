New
WA
Writing
Assignment
As
a
child
I
was
over
ambitious
with
my
schoolwork.
After
I
learned
the
proper
formations
of
the
letters
in
the
alphabet,
I
began
writing.
Usually
my
writings
were
picture
captions.
I
would
often
draw
pictures
of
snowball
fights,
my
cousins
and
my
brother.
After
I
was
done
coloring
I
would
write
small
paragraphs
about
the
scene
I
had
set.
We
were
forced
to
use
huge
blue
pencils
in
kindergarten
that
were
really
hard
to
maneuver
in
my
small
five-year
old
hand.
The
erasers
were
really
terrible
and
were
really
poor
tools
for
the
thin
yellow
paper
my
teacher
provided.
My
first
OseriousO
writing
began
in
third
grade
under
the
supervision
of
my
teacher
Mrs.
Shain.
I
loved
to
read
a
small
child
and
she
fed
my
literary
addiction
with
books
like
E.B.
WhiteOs
CharlotteOs
Web
and
Roald
DahlOs
BFG.
I
donOt
think
I
wrote
any
direct
responses
to
these
pieces
but
they
certainly
inspired
my
own
writing.
I
wrote
my
first
two
ObooksO
during
my
third
grade
experience.
NDippy
and
the
CavemanO
was
a
piece
inspired
by
my
love
for
dinosaurs.
I
received
a
lot
of
positive
feedback
from
my
writing
from
Mrs.
Shain,
my
parents
and
fellow
students.
My
writing
was
very
descriptive
but
sometimes
incoherent.
Organization
seemed
to
be
a
problem
for
me.
I
also
was
involved
in
poetry
writing
in
elementary
school.
I
wrote
poems
about
nature,
including
a
poem
entitled
NTimberO
about
a
forest
being
cut
down.
I
also
submitted
a
haiku
I
wrote
about
Othe
living
oceanO
to
a
book
of
childrenOs
poetry.
It
seems
as
though
I
was
allowed
to
be
my
most
creative
self
during
those
elementary
school
years.
No
structure
or
constrictive
rules
were
impinged
on
my
writing.
We
would
often
just
be
given
the
instruction
to
Ofree
writeO.
That
meant
we
had
to
keep
our
pencils
on
the
yellow
paper
with
big
lines
until
the
time
was
up.
We
werenOt
allowed
to
lift
our
pencils
under
any
circumstance.
If
no
words
were
flowing
we
were
instructed
to
doodle
until
more
words
appeared.
This
was
probably
one
of
the
best
practices
I
have
been
taught.
The
process
of
Ogetting
startedO
has
always
been
a
hard
one
for
me.
I
often
find
myself
going
back
to
this
pencil
to
paper
for
thirty
minutes
routine.
I
almost
always
start
off
with
a
topic
thatOs
almost
completely
unrelated
to
what
I
should
be
writing
about
and
usually
end
up
in
a
decent
place.
After
elementary
school,
as
my
writing
progressed,
it
seemed
to
get
more
rigid
and
less
OcreativeO.
I
remember
writing
my
first
essays
in
response
to
literature
in
8th
grade.
I
couldOve
possibly
started
writing
such
papers
before
then,
but
it
is
not
in
my
memory
bank.
I
was
in
two
writing
intensive
classes
that
year.
An
advanced
literature
course
and
8th
grade
English
that
everyone
had
to
take.
We
studied
Oliterary
devicesO
such
as
symbolism
that
year.
We
wrote
many
papers
on
the
symbolism
that
was
present
in
short
stories
and
books
such
as
NOf
Mice
and
MenO.
Although
this
was
a
growing
experience
for
me,
having
never
responded
to
literature
before,
I
didnOt
see
enough
criticism.
My
advanced
literature
teacher
Ms.
Nadolski
had
so
many
students
in
her
class,
we
received
very
little
attention.
The
papers
I
got
back
had
very
little
criticism
written
on
them
and
her
standard
A
or
A+
grade.
I
had
a
lot
of
potential
in
middle
school
but
I
donOt
feel
I
was
given
proper
direction.
The
assignments
were
very
structured
and
Oquestion
basedO.
Organization
was
a
problem
for
me,
but
rather
then
teach
me
how
to
fix
it,
my
teacher
Ms.
Foti
would
rearrange
my
paragraphs
for
me.
As
I
mentioned
previously,
my
first
writings
were
scrawled
down
on
paper
with
the
use
of
large
pencils.
When
I
learned
how
to
type
properly
in
middle
school,
I
found
that
it
was
much
easier
for
me
to
write
while
using
the
keyboard.
Teachers
would
always
force
me
to
write
a
rough
draft
out
by
hand
first
and
then
type
it.
This
always
frustrated
me
because
my
rough
drafts
on
paper
were
always
worse
than
my
rough
drafts
that
I
had
typed.
For
whatever
reason,
I
find
my
thoughts
flow
better
with
my
continuous
flow
of
typing.
However,
I
have
found
that
with
the
computer
as
writing
medium,
I
am
more
apt
to
delete
large
portions
of
my
writing.
Now
that
I
recognize
this
tendency,
I
try
to
leave
what
I
consider
Obad
writingO
in
my
drafts
until
I
give
it
a
second
look.
In
addition,
my
proofreading
skills
are
often
impaired
if
I
simply
stare
at
the
computer
screen.
After
handing
in
a
few
papers
having
only
proofread
without
printing
it
out
first,
IOve
learned
my
lesson.
In
order
for
me
to
seriously
edit
I
need
to
print
out
my
papers
triple
spaced
numerous
times
before
IOm
ready
for
the
final
copy.
In
the
past,
I
have
been
hypersensitive
to
criticism
on
my
writing.
The
grades
I
have
received
have
always
been
of
the
utmost
importance
to
me,
however
I
have
tried
to
accept
each
assignment
as
a
Nlearning
experienceO
independent
of
whether
or
not
I
received
an
A
or
a
C
on
it.
My
writing
had
always
been
blindly
praised
throughout
elementary
and
middle
schools.
However,
when
I
got
to
high
school
I
had
the
biggest
wakeup
call
of
my
life.
I
could
not
write
a
proper
academic
paper.
Mrs.
Glasser,
my
9th
grade
honors
English
teacher
taught
me
a
lot
that
year.
The
class
was
a
very
competitive
atmosphere.
Over
50
students
had
applied
for
the
honors
class
but
only
18
were
accepted
in.
I
didnOt
think
this
qualified
me
as
Othe
bestO
writer,
but
I
didnOt
think
I
wrote
C-
papers.
Our
first
assignment
was
an
expository
essay
on
NThe
Sound
of
WavesO.
I
thought
I
had
done
a
decent
job
on
the
paper.
The
day
we
got
it
back,
my
heart
sank
as
I
read
N70%,
SEE
MEO
in
big
red
ink.
So,
I
went
to
see
Mrs.
Glasser
during
her
lunch
hour
and
she
picked
apart
my
paper
from
start
to
finish.
I
actually
felt
much
better
knowing
what
was
wrong
with
it
and
why
I
had
received
such
a
low
grade.
I
did
not
have
a
strong
thesis
and
my
organization
was
all
over
the
place.
I
dropped
quotes
and
included
invariably
too
much
text
from
the
book.
In
fact,
until
that
meeting
with
her,
I
had
no
idea
what
the
word
OthesisO
meant.
I
just
thought
it
was
a
really
long
paper
you
needed
to
write
in
order
to
get
your
MasterOs
degree.
So,
from
then
on
I
spent
lunch
with
Mrs.
Glasser
going
over
my
papers
while
she
ate
her
tuna
salad.
Having
personal
one-on-one
time
in
an
open
dialogue
really
helped
my
writing.
I
became
more
confident
after
my
initial
knock
down
by
the
C
I
was
getting
in
English
and
my
writing
progressed.
All
I
wanted
to
do
was
get
better
at
the
traditional
Othree
paragraph
formO
expository
essay.
I
ended
the
class
with
a
final
grade
of
a
high
B.
Grades
aside
though,
what
I
learned
from
Mrs.
Glasser
was
invaluable.
Her
patience
and
understanding
with
young
writers
such
as
myself
was
unbelievable
and
guided
me,
along
with
many
others
in
the
right
direction.
My
11th
grade
teacher,
Ms.
Fraley
assigned
us
a
10-page
research
paper
as
our
final
project.
We
were
given
a
total
of
four
months
to
compose
this
paper,
on
a
topic
of
our
choice.
I
picked
the
womenOs
rights
movements,
starting
with
suffrage
and
ending
with
the
life/choice
controversy
today.
It
was
a
very
long
and
drawn
out
process.
Ms.
Fraley
forced
us
to
write
all
of
our
notes
on
100
index
cards
to
prevent
accidental
plagiarism.
The
index
card
idea
was
great
for
some,
but
didnOt
work
out
too
well
for
me.
I
lost
many
cards
and
found
it
actually
made
me
more
disorganized
and
consumed
way
too
much
time
for
what
it
was
worth.
After
the
frustrating
fifteen-page
paper
was
finally
finished,
I
felt
a
great
sense
of
accomplishment.
That
was
the
longest
paper
I
had
written
and
it
made
me
realize
how
much
I
really
enjoyed
research
papers.
My
12th
grade
teacher
Ms.
Patton
was
enlightening
but
did
not
really
help
my
writing
along
in
any
major
way
that
I
could
tell.
However,
as
I
left
high
school
I
felt
I
was
prepared
enough
to
write
on
a
college
level.
When
I
got
to
college,
I
again
felt
the
disappointment
of
a
C
on
my
first
major
paper.
I
started
my
struggle
all
over
again
and
reached
out
for
help
from
my
teacher,
Ms.
Fields.
My
English101
teacher
at
the
University
of
Maryland
my
freshman
year
had
a
big
impact
on
my
writing.
She
introduced
me
to
Ann
LamottOs
book
Bird
by
Bird,
which
has
proven
to
be
a
priceless
source
of
inspiration
for
my
writing.
One
of
my
favorite
quotes
from
her
book
is,
Nperfectionism
is
a
mean,
frozen
form
of
idealism,
while
messes
are
the
artistOs
true
friend.
What
people
somehow
forgot
to
mention
when
we
were
children
was
that
we
need
to
make
messes
in
order
to
find
out
who
we
are
and
why
we
are
here-and,
be
extension,
what
weOre
supposed
to
be
writing.O
Her
chapter
so
creatively
entitled,
OperfectionismO
was
clearly
written
for
people
like
myself.
I
often
hesitate
when
it
comes
to
starting
a
writing
endeavor.
I
am
scared
itOs
going
to
be
ObadO
and
horribly
embarrassing
if
anyone
sees
it.
But
Lamott,
and
my
freshman
English
teacher
really
eased
my
fears
and
helped
me
to
be
okay
with
writing
what
Lamott
has
termed
Oshitty
rough
draftsO.
Her
philosophy
is
that
you
need
a
big
mess
to
start
out
with.
The
trick
is
just
learning
how
to
clean
up
the
mess
and
make
it
into
something
great.
I
still
get
nervous
while
starting
a
new
paper
or
writing
project
but
I
try
to
head
LamottOs
advice
as
much
as
possible.
My
teacher
introduced
the
idea
of
Oshort
assignmentsO
to
me
that
year.
She
never
made
us
hand
in
lengthy
papers
without
first
having
to
hand
in
short
assignments.
The
first
day
weOd
only
have
to
write
one
paragraph
of
our
paper
and
then
as
time
passed,
the
short
paragraph
was
turned
into
a
ten-page
paper.
My
teacher
utilized
one
of
LamottOs
writing
techniques
by
having
us
write
only
what
we
could
fit
into
a
None
inch
picture
frameO.
The
idea
of
short
assignments
has
really
helped
me
progress
in
my
writing.
I
often
feel
extremely
overwhelmed
by
the
thought
of
a
deadline
and
a
page
minimum.
Still,
I
have
trouble
meeting
length
requirements
and
generating
enough
ideas
to
fill
the
pages.
The
theme
of
the
class
was
NEthos,
Pathos
and
LogosO.
The
objective
was
to
learn
how
to
write
persuasively
and
effectively
while
utilizing
proper
academic
sources.
We
wrote
four
papers
that
semester
and
did
a
lot
of
revision.
I
find
my
best
papers
come
out
of
forced
revision.
It
is
hard
as
a
student
with
many
deadlines
and
a
tight
schedule
to
force
yourself
to
revise
numerous
times
before
handing
in
a
final
draft
of
a
paper.
In
this
class
we
were
constantly
revising
and
received
a
small
grade
for
our
two
rough
drafts
and
a
larger
one
for
our
final
drafts.
Much
of
my
success
can
be
accredited
to
my
classmates.
We
were
all
really
honest
with
one
another
and
really
helped
each
other
work
out
the
kinks
in
our
writings.
That
semester
I
also
learned
how
much
I
enjoyed
persuasive
writing
when
I
was
able
to
write
on
a
topic
I
really
had
a
passion
for.
I
chose
to
write
my
twenty-page
research
position
paper
on
the
issue
of
gay
marriage.
I
gained
many
research
skills
and
used
many
of
the
resources
in
MarylandOs
libraries.
My
VAST
class
here
at
Lafayette
was
different
then
any
other
class
I
have
ever
taken.
It
did
not
seem
to
be
really
writing
intensive
but
rather
a
reflective
seminar-type
class.
However
our
writing
assignments
were
very
open
ended
which
I
feel
helped
me
gain
more
of
a
personal
style
and
voice.
My
other
writing
course
here
at
Lafayette
was
a
religion
one.
I
was
very
foreign
to
the
topics
so
I
often
found
it
difficult
to
write
the
papers.
This
may
have
been
my
worst
experience
as
a
writer.
We
had
to
formulate
our
own
topics
and
ideas,
which
again
was
a
good
lesson
for
me
to
learn.
It
was
unbelievably
difficult
to
write
lengthy
papers
on
topics
I
didnOt
have
a
good
grasp
of.
I
went
for
help,
but
my
writing
was
rarely
addressed.
Instead,
I
had
to
discuss
the
raw
material
in
order
to
get
a
better
hold
of
it.
My
major
downfall
in
my
writing
has
always
been
my
organization.
Teachers
have
always
commented
on
my
organization.
I
always
get
the
line,
NItOs
all
here.
ItOs
just
not
put
together
in
the
right
order.O
Putting
everything
together
in
the
right
fashion
seems
to
be
extremely
difficult
for
me.
It
also
is
the
hardest
for
me
to
see
in
my
own
writing.
While
objectively
looking
at
other
writersO
work,
I
usually
can
point
out
where
they
can
improve
upon
their
organization.
The
organization
of
my
papers
always
make
sense
in
my
head,
but
once
the
errors
of
my
ways
have
been
pointed
out,
I
can
see
how
confusing
my
writing
can
be.
I
have
always
tried
my
best
to
keep
a
personal
journal.
However,
like
most
people
I
forget
about
it
and
end
up
with
huge
gaps
of
time.
Writing
is
therapeutic
for
me,
especially
during
difficult
times.
I
have
often
noticed
my
individual
voice
is
strongest
when
I
am
writing
for
no
audience
but
myself.
I
am
a
much
stronger
writer
now,
having
progressed
from
a
picture
caption
to
twenty
page
research
papers.
I
havenOt
done
much
creative
writing
or
even
literary
writing
in
quite
a
while.
I
think
much
of
a
writersO
growth
is
dependent
on
all
different
forms
of
writing.
Much
of
my
academic
writing
most
recently
comes
in
the
form
of
laboratory
reports
since
I
am
a
Neuroscience
major.
These
writings
are
very
structured
and
leave
little
room
for
creativity.
I
hope
to
be
given
more
opportunities
at
Lafayette
to
expressively
write
rather
than
write
to
fill
out
a
highly
structured
format.
