The
earliest
moments
of
writing
come
back
filled
with
colorful
crayons
and
traceable
letters
waiting
to
be
copied.
These
were
the
times
when
simply
attempting
the
assigned
project
netted
a
rNice
Jobs
or
rExcellent
Works
and
almost
anything
would
end
up
plastered
magnetically
to
the
refrigerator.
After
each
school
day,
I
would
come
home
and
practice
my
rABCus
and
123uss
diligently
copying
the
letter
of
the
day.
Letters
and
numbers
became
second
nature.
The
entire
alphabet
flowed
smoothly,
well
as
smoothly
as
a
five
year
old
can
write,
from
the
tip
of
an
oversized,
school-bus
yellow
pencil.
Preschool
came
and
went,
paving
the
way
for
a
new
step
in
my
educational
journey.
However,
within
the
first
month
of
kindergarten
my
writing
progress
came
crashing
to
the
groundiliterally.
One
cool
September
day,
I
decided
to
tackle
my
biggest
playground
challenge:
the
monkey
bars.
Bravely
I
climbed
the
steps,
forcing
my
feet
to
continue,
quickly
wrapping
my
hands
around
the
first
bar.
Darkness
reigned
for
the
next
few
hours
eventually
breaking
to
reveal
a
softly
glowing
light
and
a
hard
cocoon
engulfing
my
right
arm.
Still
groggy,
I
attempted
to
discover
what
had
occurred;
I
begged
my
parents
to
explain
why
a
hard
shell
now
encased
my
limb.
I
came
to
understand
that
the
monkey
bars
bested
me
and
in
an
attempt
to
soften
my
fall,
my
right
arm
became
victim
to
cruel
gravity.
The
six-year
old
me
didnut
quite
realize
the
severity
of
my
dance
with
danger
and
how
greatly
it
would
impact
me
both
immediately
and
in
the
years
to
come.
My
progress
as
a
rwriters
had
vanished;
lost
within
the
confines
of
a
neon
green,
form-fitting,
itchy
cage.
Attempt
after
attempt
proved
fruitless,
as
I
couldnut
procure
a
single
discernable
letter,
from
either
hand.
I
felt
crushed
and
defeated.
However,
even
as
a
child,
I
refused
to
let
adversity
keep
me
down,
rather
I
used
my
misfortune
as
motivation.
During
class
and
free
hours
at
home,
I
learned
to
master
writing
with
my
left
hand.
After
only
a
few
weeks,
letters
became
decipherable
and
my
confidence
grew
exponentially.
My
left-handed
tactics
quickly
surpassed
my
right-handed
ones
in
every
category:
neatness,
ease,
and
legibility.
The
months
melted
into
one
another
and
soon
it
came
time
for
the
removal
of
the
cage.
As
the
doctor
wiped
the
last
bits
of
dust
from
my
arm,
I
gently
flexed
my
fingers
and
arm,
relieved
to
discover
all
joints
moved
smoothly.
But
despite
my
newfound
freedom,
I
didnut
feel
much
different.
I
had
overcome
my
misfortune
and
greatly
benefited,
gaining
confidence
and
drive
I
had
never
felt
before.
My
rleft-handednesss
became
a
rlightning-bolt
scars,
constantly
reminding
me
of
tragedy
but
providing
the
motivation
to
overcome
any
challenge
I
faced.
Throughout
most
of
first
and
second
grade,
writing
consisted
of
opening
a
pale
blue,
six-inch
notebook
and
recounting
the
activities
of
the
previous
weekend.
I
never
truly
found
these
assignments
exciting,
which
may
explain
my
strict
adherence
to
the
five-sentence
minimum.
Although,
in
retrospect,
I
spent
just
as
much
time
constructing
those
five
sentences
as
some
spent
on
seven
or
nine,
trying
to
ensure
they
met
my
standards.
Even
on
assignments
I
hated,
I
could
not
give
less
then
my
best;
I
would
not
let
myself.
And
when
my
teacher
would
ask
who
wanted
to
share,
my
hand
shot
up
like
a
rocket
every
time.
I
loved
sharing,
although
I
kept
it
well
hidden
from
my
peers
and
teachers
who
assumed
I
was
just
energetic
about
anything
school-related.
I
wanted
others
to
hear
what
I
had
to
say
and
welcomed
the
praise
that
always
seemed
to
accompany
my
work:
rExcellent
Job!s,
rNice
Use
of
Vocab!s,
and
rWell
Written!s
Admiration
quickly
inflated
my
head
until
my
mother
taught
me
a
few
lessons
in
humility.
During
third
grade,
I
encountered
the
rpersuasive
essays
for
the
first
time
and
although
the
concept
seemed
simple
enough
(pick
a
side
and
defend
it),
this
assignment
would
test
me
in
many
other
ways.
My
teacher
also
introduced
the
five-paragraph
essay
that
day,
a
format
that
I
would
later
struggle
to
run-learns.
She
outlined
the
basic
structure
explaining
that
the
first
paragraph
would
introduce
the
topic
with
the
last
sentence
of
that
paragraph
containing
our
thesis,
our
main
point.
The
next
three
paragraphs,
the
body,
would
give
three
different
reasons
or
explanations
as
to
why
our
chosen
ideal
was
most
logical.
Finally,
the
fifth
paragraph
would
wrap
up
all
of
our
main
points
and
end
with
a
statement
that
made
the
reader
solidly
agree
with
what
s/he
had
read.
I
quickly
set
to
work
explaining
the
reasons
why
students
should
receive
homework;
not
the
most
popular
choice
among
my
peers,
but
I
tended
to
disagree
with
most
of
their
rI-hate-schools
philosophies.
Eager
to
turn
the
assignment
in
early,
I
finished
up
my
paper
two
days
before
the
due
date,
presenting
it
to
my
mom
for
a
final
evaluation.
I
had
checked
it,
but
I
never
really
had
faith
in
my
proof-reading
abilities.
During
most
of
grade
school,
I
had
hated
English
assignments
but
hated
rbad
gradess
even
more
so
better
safe
than
sorry.
My
mom
worked
as
an
insurance
adjuster
at
the
time,
but
she
received
her
degree
in
English
and
I
always
found
her
opinions
and
suggestions
helpful.
I
handed
my
paper
to
her
excitedly,
typed
and
ready,
expecting
only
a
few
grammatical
corrections.
She
happily
took
it
and
began
reading,
making
comments
in
the
margins.
After
what
seemed
forever,
she
handed
it
back
and
began
asking
me
some
questions:
rDoes
this
really
make
sense?s;
rAre
you
sure
this
is
the
best
reason?s;
rThis
is
really
confusing,
what
did
you
mean?s
She
had
no
malice
or
contempt
in
her
voice,
my
mom
only
wanted
to
help
but
at
the
time,
I
took
it
as
a
devastating
blow.
rWha-a-a-t
do
you
mean?s
my
voice
quivered
with
anger.
She
explained
that
while
my
three
reasons
were
good,
I
didnut
do
a
great
job
of
clarifying
them.
My
mom
continued,
telling
me
never
to
assume
that
my
reader
knows
my
thought
process
and
to
describe
my
ideas
as
fully
as
possible.
I
thought
that
my
paper
did
an
excellent
job
of
that
task
and
I
quickly
began
regurgitating
my
entire
paper.
After
my
outburst
subsided,
my
mom
sat
down
next
to
me
and
smiled.
rYou
need
to
include
everything
you
just
told
me
and
your
paper
will
make
much
more
sense.
Tell
your
reader
all
of
your
thoughts,
not
just
half
of
them.s
Heavy-heartedly,
I
picked
up
my
paper,
setting
about
to
fix
my
errors.
And
although
each
attempt
came
closer,
each
time
my
mom
would
find
something
else
I
had
missed.
By
the
third
round
of
edits,
I
felt
defeated:
my
confidence
shaken
and
ego
greatly
deflated.
I
begrudgingly
handed
over
my
revised
essay
hoping
some
miracle
would
prevent
me
from
having
to
rewrite
it
for
a
fourth
time.
My
miracle
came
in
the
form
of
a
smile
and
a
rGreat
Jobs.
Relieved,
I
placed
the
finished
work
in
my
backpack
ready
to
turn
in
after
two
days
of
revisions.
I
received
the
assignment
back
with
an
rAs
stamped
across
the
top
in
bright
red
ink.
Flipping
through
for
comments,
I
found
no
red
marks
only
a
small
message
on
the
last
page,
rOutstanding
Essay,
well-written
and
intelligently
thought
out!s
My
ego
swelled
but
only
to
realize
that
I
owed
a
great
deal
of
success
to
my
momi
Many,
if
not
all,
of
my
grade
school
writing
assignments
proceeded
in
a
similar
vein:
I
would
finish
a
few
days
before
the
due
date
and
revise
until
my
mom
felt
the
assignment
was
relatively
rerror-frees.
My
skills
improved
vastly
and
I
required
fewer
revisions
with
each
persuasive
paper
and
research
essay
but
my
distaste
for
writing
only
grew.
Whether
boring,
restrictive
topics
or
dull,
formulaic
five-paragraph
requirements
disenchanted
me,
I
truly
cannot
say.
Thankfully,
however,
high
school
provided
just
the
spark
and
I
needed
to
understand
the
cathartic
effect
of
true
writing.
Placing
into
every
honors
class
available,
my
scheduled
seemed
rather
daunting
and
formidable,
but
my
biggest
concern:
English
class.
Now,
my
apprehension
didnut
stem
from
a
lack
of
confidence
or
fear,
but
rather
from
experience.
I
knew
that
my
forte
lay
in
the
realm
of
numbers
and
symbols
not
words
and
punctuation.
Nevertheless,
I
trudged
onward,
quickly
realizing
how
wrong
my
previous
conceptions
about
writing
and
English
had
been.
rThe
Natural,
Lord
of
the
Flies,
The
Chosen,
Romeo
and
Julietis
The
list
of
material
we
would
read
for
the
year
was
printed
boldly
on
the
syllabus
in
front
of
me.
rShakespeare,s
I
thought
to
myself
sarcastically,
rGreat!s
But
we
didnut
rreads
Romeo
and
Juliet,
at
least,
not
in
the
traditional
way.
Rather
we
acted
it
out--becoming
the
characters--delving
into
the
flaws
and
strengths
of
each.
We
grew
to
understand
and
value
Mercutio,
Tibalt,
Paris,
and
Benvolio.
This
was
the
first
time
I
had
truly
enjoyed
reading
a
book
as
a
class,
although
we
werenut
really
rreadings
it.
But
what
followed,
I
found
even
more
amazing.
As
with
any
other
work
that
we
read,
a
writing
assignment
followed
the
conclusion
of
the
story.
I
canut
remember
the
essay
topic
exactly
(a
character
analysis,
I
recall),
however,
I
do
remember,
for
the
first
time
ever,
I
was
excited
to
start
writing.
Ideas
poured
out
onto
the
blank
page
and
wouldnut
stop
flowing.
Within
a
few
days,
I
completed
the
assignment
and
handed
it
over
to
my
mom
for
a
revision
check.
Expecting
quite
a
few
comments
due
to
the
relative
quickness
with
which
the
paper
was
finished,
I
received
an
amazing
surprise
when
the
only
marks
were
missing
punctuation
and
a
typo.
Ecstatic,
I
fixed
the
few
minor
errors
and
turned
in
my
paper.
But
something
still
bothered
me,
rWhy
had
it
been
so
easy
to
complete
this
particular
assignment?
What
made
it
different?s
The
answer
wouldnut
come
to
me
until
two
years
later
during
my
AP
Language
and
Composition
(affectionately
AP
Lang)
class.
Junior
year,
the
most
difficult
year
as
many
sources
forewarned.
Four
AP
classes,
the
beginning
of
college
searching,
the
HSPA
(High
School
Proficiency
Assessment),
plus
all
of
the
normal
drama
and
work
that
goes
along
with
daily
life;
yes,
junior
year
seemed
to
become
more
overwhelming
with
every
second.
Ironically,
my
AP
Lang
class,
the
most
difficult
class
I
ever
took
in
high
school,
provided
me
with
the
tools
to
overcome
the
stress
and
find
a
much-needed
balance.
With
the
ever-growing
technological
era,
education
seemed
destined
to
cross
paths
with
this
behemoth
and
it
did,
in
the
form
of
a
blog.
Each
week
my
teacher
would
post
a
new
question
online.
Many
times,
she
would
pose
highly
thought-provoking
questions
that
required
the
entire
week
to
complete
but,
on
occasion,
the
questions
were
simple
and
just
there
for
a
laugh.
These
questions
seemed
far
beyond
the
reach
of
normal
high
school
essay
topics.
Regurgitation
of
plots
and
symbolic
analysis
never
found
their
way
onto
our
weekly
blog,
rather,
self-reflections,
personal
discoveries,
and
heated
debates
reigned.
For
the
first
time
ever,
writing
wasnut
simply
about
making
sure
a
reading
assignment
rsank-ins.
One
of
the
best
questions,
and
most
enlightening,
dealt
with
paradox
of
an
eternally
merciful
God
and
the
concept
of
Hell.
Raised
religiously,
this
question
constantly
floated
around
my
head
as
I
tried
to
reconcile
the
conflicting
ideals
as
many
church
officials
had
done
before.
Paraphrasing
their
explanations,
I
answered
the
question
passionately,
using
everything
I
had
learned.
With
one
click,
I
posted
my
answer.
However,
the
assignment
remained
unfinished.
In
addition
to
our
response,
we
were
required
to
read
other
postings
and
comment
upon
anything
we
found
interesting,
well
done,
disagreeable,
or
in
need
of
revision.
This
final
component,
a
peer
edit,
provided
quick
feedback
and
allowed
each
student
to
improve
his/her
writing
abilities
each
and
every
week.
The
post
I
chose
to
review
had
a
greater
impact
upon
me
than
anything
its
author
could
have
felt.
Diametrically
opposed
to
and
written
with
as
much
fervor
as
my
posting,
I
almost
choked
as
I
reread
it,
making
sure
the
words
actually
meant
what
I
thought.
Following
the
initial
shock,
I
gathered
my
thoughts
and
began
to
formulate
questions.
Each
question
contained
more
rbitternesss
than
the
last
as
I
was
unable
to
control
my
newfound
passion.
Hotheadedly,
I
submitted
my
remarks
and
waited
for
the
response.
I,
however,
greatly
underestimated
my
ropponents.
He
matched
every
question
with
an
equally
witty
and
clever
answer,
but
my
pride
wouldnut
allow
me
to
back
down,
not
with
so
much
riding
on
the
outcome.
It
continued
for
hours,
questions
and
answers,
retort
and
counter
retort.
Frustrated
at
my
rineptitudes,
I
accepted
defeat
and
began
contemplating
what
had
occurred,
but
I
realized
frustration
was
only
a
front,
I
actually
felt
invigorated,
excited,
and
relaxed.
My
mind
flashed
back
to
the
Romeo
and
Juliet
essay
and
I
finally
understood.
Passion
flowed
through
both
assignments
controlling
every
word
and
idea.
Up
until
high
school,
the
red
wave
had
never
washed
over
me,
never
given
up
its
powers,
never
revealed
its
secrets.
I
had
unlocked
a
treasureiathe
secret
to
writingiawithin
the
turmoil
of
that
blog
post.
From
that
point,
I
learned
to
enjoy
writing
and
it
became
a
cathartic,
welcomed
process
rather
than
a
stress-filled,
undesirable
obligationi
Junior
year
became
senior
year
and
the
college
application
process
came
and
went;
autumn
blossomed
into
spring
and
my
spot
as
valedictorian
and
a
graduation
speaker
solidified.
I
produced
my
most
impassioned
piece
of
writing
ever
and
my
favorite.
Based
on
the
invaluable
lessons
from
music,
words
and
ideas
erupted
from
my
fingertips.
The
ceremony
and
my
speech
went
fantastically.
But
with
the
end
of
high
school,
a
new
experience
harkened
in
the
distance:
Lafayette
College.
As
an
Engineer
with
credit
for
English101,
writing
seemed
to
be
disappearing
just
as
I
had
learned
to
embrace
it.
My
FYS
thankfully
provided
the
creative
jolt
I
needed
as
math
and
science
classes
consumed
my
schedule.
It
provided
balance,
stimulating
parts
of
my
brain
that
other
classes
couldnut.
During
the
final
days
of
that
class,
my
professor
pulled
me
aside
and
told
me
that
my
writing
had
renewed
his
faith
in
my
generation,
that
I
rekindled
his
light.
Words
canut
describe
how
I
felt
that
day,
joy
and
happiness
overloaded
my
brain.
As
I
begin
my
job
as
a
WA,
I
hope
to
provide
all
students
I
mentor
the
opportunity
to
feel
such
happiness,
to
realize
their
work
truly
means
something,
and
to
instill
the
understanding
that
words
hold
more
power
than
any
weapon
on
Earth.
My
main
priority
remains
helping
them
to
improve
their
writing
abilities,
but
if
I
can
show
them
the
exhilaration
that
comes
from
impassioned
writing,
it
will
make
learning
that
much
more
satisfying.
This
is
also
the
beginning
of
a
new
chapter
in
my
writing
career;
learning
alongside
those
I
assist,
my
writing
can
only
grow
and
evolve,
as
well.
