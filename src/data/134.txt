Writing
Like
a
WA
8/15/1997
Walking
out
of
the
WA
training
workshop
last
year,
I
felt
that
knot
of
self-doubt
in
my
stomach.
I
had
already
contacted
the
professor
I
was
assigned
to,
I
had
met
with
him
and
discussed
what
I
felt
was
necessary,
I
had
done
the
assigned
readings,
I
had
practically
memorized
the
WA
handbook,
and
still,
deep
inside,
I
was
a
bit
scared.
I
had
received
valuable
advice
at
the
workshop,
but
I
still
didn't
feel
like
I
knew
what
I
was
doing.
I
just
wanted
my
own
conferences
to
start
so
that
I
could
find
my
own
WA-style,
and
figure
out
how
I
fit
in
this
WA-picture.
I
was
assigned
to
a
FYS
taught
by
a
professor
who
believed
that
writing
is
a
process
rather
than
a
singular
event.
The
students
in
the
class
were
primarily
freshmen
engineering
majors,
so
I
expected
to
have
to
deal
with
that
infamous
I
am
an
engineer
so
I
don't
need
to
write
attitude.
Contrary
to
my
expectations,
I
didn't
encounter
much
of
that.
What
I
did
have
to
deal
with,
however,
were
papers
written
exclusively
in
incomplete
sentences,
papers
with
no
theses,
papers
without
even
an
argument.
As
I
was
reading
the
first
set
of
papers,
it
seemed
unbelievable
that
these
were
works
of
high
school
graduates.
I
knew
my
help
was
needed,
and
I
felt
confident
I
could
help.
But
deep
inside
was
still
that
What
if
they
resent
my
help?
This
concern,
however,
did
not
last
much
longer.
At
the
end
of
one
of
the
last
papers
I
read,
was
a
handwritten
note,
saying
something
to
the
effect:
Dear
WA,
I
know
this
is
bad,
but
I
am
really
trying
my
hardest.
I
know
I
need
help.
This
genuineness
dissipated
all
of
my
fears.
My
help
was
WANTED!
My
first
set
of
conferences
went
great.
I
did
a
lot
of
explaining
of
what
a
thesis
is,
why
it
is
necessary,
and
why
good
structure
of
a
paper
makes
such
a
difference.
I
helped
my
writers
develop
a
logical
argument
using
the
ideas
they
already
had
put
on
paper.
I
reassured
that
it
is
perfectly
okay
to
be
baffled
,
to
not
be
able
to
reach
a
definite
conclusion
at
the
end
of
a
paper.
I
gave
everyone
the
option
of
meeting
with
me
a
second
time,
even
though
I
didn't
have
to.
Most
of
the
class
did.
I
observed
an
improvement
in
everyone's
papers,
and
I
think
this
was
one
of
the
most
rewarding
feelings
ever.
From
then
on,
I
had
no
doubts
that
I
was
capable
of
doing
my
job
as
a
WA.
I
had
established
a
good
relationship
between
me
and
my
writers,
and
I
had
the
backing
of
the
professor.
I
helped
everyone
to
the
best
of
my
ability,
I
watched
them
improve
(some
more,
some
less)
with
every
paper.
At
the
end
of
the
semester,
I
met
with
the
professor,
and
he
thanked
me
for
making
a
difference
in
everyone's
writing,
and
helping
everyone
to
get
the
most
out
of
their
working
with
me.
I
felt
truly
appreciated
Meanwhile,
I
was
dealing
with
challenges
on
my
own
writing
front.
I
was
taking
an
extensive
writing
course
which
brought
my
writing
up
to
a
whole
new
level.
First
of
all,
I
learned
that
my
weakness
as
a
writer
lay
in
my
introductions.
They
were
just
boring
and
dull
compared
to
the
rest
of
my
paper.
I
knew
the
introduction
had
to
answer
three
basic
questions:
WHAT
am
I
going
to
say
with
this
paper,
HOW
am
I
going
to
say
it,
and
why
is
it
important
(or
SO
WHAT,
as
we
called
it
in
class).
I
did
wonderfully
with
WHAT
and
HOW,
but
that
SO
WHAT
part
got
me
every
time.
I
have
never
felt
at
such
a
loss
to
express
something.
And
as
hard
as
I
worked
on
it,
I
don't
think
I
have
fully
mastered
it
yet.
This
particular
class
was
also
a
formative
writing
experience
for
me
because
this
is
where
I
wrote
the
hardest
paper
I
have
ever
had
to
write.
We
had
to
make
observations
about
Montaigne's
writing
style,
and
use
these
observations
to
create
our
very
own
interpretation
of
an
aspect
of
Montaigne's
writing.
I
formulated
a
model
of
how
Montaigne
viewed
the
self,
which
explained
the
tensions
and
apparent
contradictions
in
Montaigne's
self-representation
throughout
the
Essays.
I
felt
like
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
started
form
scratch,
with
just
a
text,
and
generated
a
smart
interpretation
truly
by
myself.
It
was
also
with
this
paper
that
I
truly
realized
the
power
of
revision.
I
kept
reading
and
revising
it
every
chance
I
got,
and
by
the
time
I
had
to
submit
it,
it
was
a
piece
of
writing
I
was
truly
proud
of.
In
the
process
of
writing
my
final
paper
for
this
particular
class,
I
experienced
the
worst
case
of
writer's
block
.
I
had
to
reflect
on
my
own
writing
practices
and
discuss
an
aspect
of
it
about
which
I
had
gained
insight
throughout
the
duration
of
the
class.
Between
this
and
my
WA
conferences,
I
felt
like
I
was
having
a
writing
process
overdose
.
All
of
a
sudden
I
felt
unable
to
come
up
with
anything.
Everything
that
came
to
my
mind
had
either
been
discussed
in
class,
or
was
trite
and
boring.
I
was
truly
speechless
-
something
I
had
never
experienced
before.
I
wrote
my
paper
about
it.
It
wasn't
until
I
finished
the
paper
that
I
realized
what
writer's
block
had
done
for
me.
It
had
pushed
me
to
move
beyond
my
writing
comfort
zone,
and
advance
my
understanding
and
treatment
of
the
writing
process
to
a
level
of
greater
sophistication,
complexity
and
maturity.
I
had
realized
that
even
in
writing,
dealing
with
difficulties
helps
you
grow.
I
know
my
writing
changed,
developed,
and
matured
during
that
semester.
I
don't
know
how
much
of
it
was
due
to
the
class
I
have
been
describing,
and
how
much
was
caused
by
my
WA
experience.
I
know,
however,
that
I
did
become
more
aware
of
my
own
writing
habits.
How
would
YOU
go
about
changing/writing
this
?
was
a
question
I
heard
many
times.
It
made
me
go
back
and
think.
I
realized
that
I
like
to
have
some
kind
of
structure
in
mind
before
I
start
writing.
I
am
not
a
just
get
it
all
out
and
worry
about
organizing
and
making
it
logical
later
kind
of
writer.
I
like
to
bounce
my
ideas
off
somebody
before
I
start,
even
if
I
know
exactly
what
I
am
doing.
I
have
to
speak
out
what
I
want
to
write
before
I
start
-
my
professors
can
attest
to
that.
During
the
second
semester
I
was
assigned
to
be
one
of
the
WA's
for
an
anthropology
class
-
an
area
of
study
which
is
completely
foreign
to
me.
My
writers
were
all
upperclassmen.
They
had
worked
with
a
WA
before,
so
they
knew
what
to
expect
of
me,
and
they
were
way
more
experienced
writers
than
the
freshmen
I
worked
with
first
semester.
It
was
an
entirely
different
experience.
The
nature
of
the
assignments
was
very
different
too.
While
during
the
first
semester
I
had
dealt
with
mostly
argument
papers,
here
the
papers
took
the
format
of
a
description
of
an
object
in
a
museum
or
the
summary
of
a
book,
followed
by
an
analysis
of
the
object/book
using
the
knowledge
obtained
in
class.
There
was
really
no
room
for
a
thesis,
and
for
the
most
part,
the
writing
issues
I
discussed
with
my
freshmen
writers
were
inappropriate
for
this
setting.
Here
I
had
to
ask
questions
like
Does
your
summary
really
need
so
much
detail?
Is
the
reader
going
to
use
all
of
it
in
understanding
your
analysis
or
is
it
just
extraneous
information?
Is
there
another
angle
from
which
you
can
look
at
the
book/object?
Sometimes
I
felt
at
a
loss.
I
was
as
unfamiliar
with
the
subject
matter
as
unfamiliar
could
be,
and
I
felt
like
I
wasn't
much
help.
However,
there
was
improvement
even
where
I
thought
I
had
been
useless.
The
professor
shared
with
me
that
she
hadn't
given
as
many
good
grades
in
a
class
in
a
long
time.
I
was
relieved
-
I
guess
I
knew
what
I
was
doing
after
all.
As
far
as
my
own
writing
went,
I
did
a
lot
of
it
for
my
VAST.
There
was
a
WA
assigned
to
the
class
and
I
took
full
advantage
of
her
expertise.
I
already
had
an
idea
of
how
I
would
approach
revising
my
papers,
but
having
another
educated
point
of
view
definitely
helped
me
improve
on
areas
I
would
probably
have
overlooked.
Once
again
I
realized
what
a
hard
time
I
have
with
introductions.
I
rewrote
the
introductions
of
my
papers
an
average
of
ten
times.
Finally,
when
writing
my
final
research
paper
for
the
class,
it
clicked.
I
had
it!!!
Not
only
the
WHAT
and
HOW,
but
also
the
SO
WHAT!!!
It
flowed
perfectly
with
my
paper,
it
did
not
sound
forced,
mechanical,
trite
or
grandiose.
It
was
just
right.
I
hope
I
can
keep
this
up.
I
have
to
admit
that
I
have
tremendously
enjoyed
my
WA
experience
so
far.
I
have
gotten
tremendous
satisfaction
out
of
it.
I
finally
realized
why
people
go
into
the
field
of
teaching.
I
have
learned
a
lot
about
writing,
and
about
the
writer
in
me.
As
cocky
as
it
might
sound,
I
consider
myself
a
pretty
good
WA.
I
attribute
my
success
to
the
fact
that
I
use
it
as
both
a
teaching
and
a
learning
opportunity.
This
would
be
the
advice
I
give
to
any
new
WA.
