My
Search
for
This
YearOs
Writing
Experiences
As
an
engineer,
writing
NexperiencesO
arenOt
usually
a
large
part
of
the
curriculum.
When
I
think
back
over
the
past
year,
my
first
instinct
is
to
say
that
I
have
had
very
few,
possibly
none
at
all,
important
writing
experiences.
So
then
I
have
to
ask
of
myself,
NIs
this
really
true?
Have
you
spent
a
whole
year
without
any
writing
at
all?O
And
after
a
lot
of
thought,
the
answer
I
come
to
is
no.
Even
though
I
have
only
been
able
to
recall
one
actual
writing
assignment
given
to
me
in
the
classroom,
I
have
had
many
other
NexperiencesO
with
writing,
both
for
my
own
personal
benefit
and
more
importantly
through
working
both
as
an
intern
abroad
this
summer
and
as
a
writing
associate
during
the
past
academic
year.
As
far
as
class-assigned
writing
goes,
as
difficult
as
it
may
be
to
believe,
I
really
did
have
only
over
this
entire
year.
Even
though
I
took
five
classes
each
of
the
two
semesters,
four
during
the
first
semester
and
all
five
during
the
second
were
traditional
engineering
classes
with
a
lot
of
reading,
math
and
problem
solving
but
no
required
writing
at
all.
My
only
exception
to
this
was
a
course
on
contemporary
French
issues.
There
was
only
one
writing
assignment,
a
ten-page
research
paper
due
at
the
end
of
the
semester
on
the
relevant
topic
of
our
choice.
While
spending
the
previous
summer
abroad
in
Paris,
I
was
intrigued
by
all
of
the
many
customs
and
traditions
which
were
especially
different
between
that
country
and
my
own.
Consequently,
I
decided
to
base
my
research
project
on
finding
the
differences
and
similarities
between
the
educational
systems
of
the
two
countries.
The
most
glaring
difference
between
this
writing
assignment
and
a
more
typical
college-level
writing
assignment
was
that
this
one
needed
to
be
written
in
French
instead
of
English.
And
it
turned
out
that
this
was
the
part
of
the
assignment
I
found
the
most
challenging.
Even
though
some
of
it
was
in
french
as
well,
the
research
process
went
smoothly
and
I
found
I
had
a
lot
of
information
to
discuss
and
was
very
eager
to
do
so.
Before
doing
any
actual
writing,
I
believed
that
the
paper
would
come
together
without
much
trouble
at
all.
However,
as
I
started
the
actual
writing,
I
found
that
even
just
one
page
was
very
hard
to
put
together.
It
was
very
hard
for
me
to
put
my
thoughts
into
the
written
word
of
another
language.
I
knew
there
were
many
things
that
I
wanted
to
say,
but
my
limited
vocabulary
skills
would
only
allow
me
to
say
so
much.
After
spending
much
time
with
a
French-English
dictionary
I
was
finally
able
to
fill
up
ten
full
pages
with
the
findings
of
my
research.
This
was
not
a
typical
writing
assignment
and
so
it
wasnOt
challenging
in
the
same
way
others
are.
However,
I
did
learn
something
very
valuable
from
this
writing
experience,
without
the
most
basic
tools
of
grammar
and
vocabulary
writing
is
extremely
difficult.
When
these
issues
become
the
focus
of
the
writer,
it
is
impossible
for
her
to
attack
other
more
sophisticated
aspects
writing.
I
have
come
across
very
similar
situations
this
summer
working
as
an
intern
in
France,
but
from
another
point
of
view
entirely.
I
have
been
working
on
a
summer-long
project
creating
a
computer
program
to
model
analytically
the
heat-transfer
effects
involved
with
laser
eye
surgery.
I
am
working
in
a
department
with
many
other
students
of
all
levels
of
education,
both
undergraduate
and
graduate.
Most
of
these
co-workers
are
French,
though
some
are
from
other
countries
as
well.
I
have
found
out
that
in
order
to
gain
recognition
for
their
work
within
the
international
engineering
and
business
world,
their
published
works
need
to
be
written
in
English.
As
this
is
not
their
first
language,
they
were
having
many
of
the
same
difficulties
I
had
faced
when
tackling
my
French
writing
assignment.
They
were
able
to
describe
their
research
and
results
very
eloquently
aloud
in
French,
but
when
they
tried
to
put
them
into
written
words
in
a
foreign
language
they
were
stuck.
Seeing
their
frustrations
helped
me
to
see
the
importance
of
having
writing
skills
specific
to
your
both
your
personal
needs
and
those
of
the
audience
you
are
trying
to
address.
I
was
able
to
help
a
few
of
them
by
reading
their
papers
and
asking
questions
in
French
when
something
was
not
clearly
expressed
in
the
paper
itself.
However,
if
I
hadnOt
been
able
to
do
this,
these
papers
may
have
been
published
as
they
were
and
would
most
likely
not
be
well-received,
not
for
the
content
but
for
the
manner
in
which
it
was
presented.
Another
thing
that
I
have
discovered
while
working
for
an
engineering
company
this
summer
is
the
different
NlanguagesO
used
within
the
world
of
engineering
or
other
sciences
and
that
used
when
people
of
this
world
need
to
interact
with
those
outside
of
it.
When
engineers
or
scientist
discuss
their
research
and
experiments
with
each
other,
they
are
able
to
use
terms
and
phrases
that
others
outside
of
their
professions
would
not
usually
understand.
Because
they
know
that
the
other
science-minded
individual
will
understand
their
part
of
the
conversation,
they
can
discuss
freely
without
having
to
explain
much
of
the
scientific
background
information.
They
become
accustomed
to
working
and
interacting
with
people
like
themselves
and
in
using
these
highly-scientific
terms
and
phrases
often
and
indifferently.
When
there
is
a
need
for
these
people
to
discuss
their
work
with
someone
outside
of
the
science
world
they
run
into
a
lot
more
problems.
They
either
simply
donOt
have
skills
necessary
to
explain
their
scientific
ideas
in
commonplace
terms
or,
more
likely,
they
have
these
skills
but
are
not
used
to
employing
them
and
find
it
difficult
to
do
so.
This
leads
to
many
of
the
same
problems
as
working
in
a
foreign
language
does.
If
a
scientist
needs
to
present
his
material
to
the
world
at
large,
he
or
she
needs
to
do
so
in
articulate
manner.
It
is
possible
to
have
a
wonderful
idea
and
the
research
and
results
to
back
it
up,
but
if
one
is
unable
to
present
both
the
purpose
and
significance
of
these
findings
to
others
in
a
way
that
they
will
clearly
understand
they
may
go
unnoticed.
I
dealt
with
this
crossover
between
the
science
and
non-science
world
often
in
my
work
as
a
Writing
Associate
over
the
past
year
as
well.
The
first
semester
I
worked
with
an
FYS
class
taught
by
an
engineering
professor
about
the
beauty
of
structural
form.
At
least
half
of
this
class
was
comprised
of
engineering
majors.
The
second
semester
I
worked
with
engineering
major
specific
VAST
about
engineering
professionalism
and
ethics.
In
both
cases
I
dealt
with
two
different
types
of
engineers
who
were
having
difficulties
with
writing,
those
who
saw
that
this
was
a
problem
that
needed
to
be
faced
in
order
to
succeed
in
the
future,
and
those
who
would
simply
say
NI
know
my
writing
isnOt
good,
but
IOm
an
engineer
writing
isnOt
important
for
me.O
The
first
group
was
the
easiest
for
me
to
work
with.
They
saw
their
inability
to
effectively
communicate
their
ideas
through
writing
as
the
problem
that
it
was,
but
more
importantly
as
a
problem
that
could
be
corrected
over
time.
I
found
that,
for
the
most
part,
these
students
were
finding
writing
to
be
a
daunting
task.
This
was
mainly
just
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
something
outside
of
their
comfort
zone
as
a
student.
In
order
to
face
this
task
they
set
out
to
write
the
best
paper
ever,
usually
for
them
meaning
one
full
of
big
impressive
words
and
other
complicated
writing
techniques.
However,
this
usually
led
to
a
paper
which
was
very
confusing
for
the
reader
and
difficult
to
understand.
The
writers
would
realize
this
problem
themselves,
either
when
writing
the
paper
or
after
reading
it
again
later
especially
if
this
was
done
aloud.
They
would
usually
then
tell
me
that
even
though
they
could
see
this
problem
they
didnOt
know
what
to
do
to
avoid
or
change
it.
I
would
then
ask
them
to
tell
me
what
they
are
trying
to
say
in
their
writing
aloud.
This
would
usually
be
much
easier
for
them
and
they
could
tell
me
directly
without
the
use
of
words
used
only
in
an
effort
to
sound
more
knowledgeable.
I
would
tell
them,
NThere,
thatOs
what
you
need
to
write
in
your
paper.O
Once
these
students
were
able
to
see
writing
simply
as
the
act
of
putting
the
ideas
in
their
mind
onto
paper
and
not
as
an
intimidating
endeavor
they
became
more
confident
in
themselves
and
thus
found
more
success
with
writing
in
the
future.
The
second
group
was
much
more
difficult.
Many
truly
believed
that
as
engineers
being
able
to
successfully
communicate
through
writing
was
not
at
all
important.
It
was
very
difficult
but
throughout
the
semester
I
was
able
convince
a
number
of
them
that
this
was
not
the
case.
I
accomplished
this
by
asking
them
questions
about
what
they
expected
out
of
jobs
in
the
future.
If
they
expected
to
be
working
as
a
member
of
a
team,
how
did
the
anticipate
communicating
with
the
team
when
they
might
not
be
present
themselves
at
all
times?
If
they
saw
themselves
working
as
part
of
a
large
corporation,
how
did
they
anticipate
inter-departmental
work
to
be
preformed?
If
they
expected
to
one
day
be
in
a
position
to
manage
the
work
of
others,
how
did
they
see
themselves
communicating
what
work
needed
to
be
completed?
As
they
thought
to
the
future
for
answers
to
these
questions
and
others,
they
began
to
see
that
without
written
communication
many
parts
of
their
prospective
professional
work
would
not
be
possible.
For
some,
this
was
enough
to
show
that
they
needed
to
value
their
writing
experiences
while
still
in
college
as
tools
for
improvement
that
would
be
necessary
later
on.
For
others,
this
was
enough
to
show
that
writing
skills
would
in
fact
be
necessary
in
the
future,
but
they
were
not
able
to
connect
this
with
the
importance
of
their
current
writing
assignments.
The
had
decided
that
research
papers
and
creative
writing
assignments
were
so
different
than
what
they
would
be
asked
to
prepare
in
the
future
that
there
was
no
reason
to
put
effort
into
them
now.
As
I
am
an
engineering
student
exactly
as
they
are
but
am
instead
very
in
favor
of
taking
advantage
of
all
of
the
writing
assignments
that
cross
my
path,
it
was
hard
for
me
to
accept
this
fact.
However,
I
finally
began
to
see
that
a
student
who
does
not
want
to
change
his
views
will
simply
not
do
so,
and
that
instead
I
had
to
use
my
time
to
work
with
the
students
that
were
more
serious
about
their
writing.
My
experiences
over
the
past
year
as
both
an
engineering
major
and
a
Writing
Associate
put
me
in
a
very
unique
position
relative
to
most
of
the
other
students
at
Lafayette.
I
definitely
have
fewer
encounters
with
writing
through
my
classroom
work
than
the
typical
non-engineering
student
would.
This
probably
does
put
me
at
a
disadvantage
in
certain
ways.
Without
being
forced
to
produce
my
own
writing
I
cannot
see
where
I
am
struggling
or
need
to
pay
closer
attention.
I
can
and
do
try
to
still
incorporate
writing
into
other
aspects
of
my
academic
studies.
I
take
detailed
notes
both
when
in
class
and
while
reading
or
studying
on
my
own
from
a
book.
When
solving
difficult
types
of
engineering
problems,
I
find
that
it
is
very
helpful
in
understanding
them
if
I
make
lists
of
the
steps
involved
citing
why
each
step
was
chosen
and
what
it
accomplished.
Writing
is
also
part
of
my
life
outside
of
the
classroom.
I
keep
an
almost-daily
personal
journal.
During
the
school
year
I
use
email
on
a
daily
basis.
Since
I
have
been
abroad
this
summer
it
has
become
my
main
form
of
communication
with
others
in
the
United
States.
These
instances
of
writing,
while
useful
in
their
own
ways,
hardly
compare
to
writing
assignments
given
and
completed
in
a
structured
classroom
environment.
They
do
not
require
near
as
much
thought,
planning
and
time
to
complete.
Also,
they
lack
the
evaluation
that
a
professor,
or
other
educated
reader,
will
give
when
reading
an
assignment.
This
is
where
one
is
most
likely
to
uncover
weaknesses
or
faults
in
their
writing
and
offers
a
huge
opportunity
for
self-improvement.
This
lack
of
traditional
writing
assignments
was
one
of
the
main
factors
in
my
decision
to
apply
for
a
position
as
a
Writing
Associate.
I
thought
the
ability
to
work
alongside
others
with
their
writing
would
help
to
fill
in
the
missing
parts
of
my
education
experience.
If
nothing
else,
working
with
other
on
their
writing
would
keep
be
connected
to
the
writing
world
a
little
and
keep
it
fresh
in
my
mind.
I
have
found
over
this
past
year
that
I
have
learned
much
more
about
writing
from
working
with
others
than
I
think
I
would
have
in
the
same
time
frame
even
I
had
done
plenty
of
academic
writing
myself.
I
have
found
that
it
is
much
easier
to
see
the
faults
and
weaknesses
in
another
personOs
paper
than
it
is
to
find
them
in
your
own.
However,
as
I
work
through
these
issues
with
other
students
I
sometimes
realize
that
I
have
committed
many
of
the
same
faults
myself
but
had
not
realized
it
at
the
time.
Also
they
were
able
to
offer
up
their
own
suggestions
and
recollections
of
their
writing
history,
which
I
was
sometimes
able
to
incorporate
aspects
of
into
either
working
with
another
student
or
writing
of
my
own.
