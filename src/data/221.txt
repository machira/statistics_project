My
Writing
has
a
History?
It
seems
funny
that
the
earliest
memories
I
have
as
a
student,
and
not
just
a
writer,
are
from
third
grade.
What
did
I
learn
before
then?
Were
kindergarten,
first,
and
second
grades
just
a
waste
of
time?
Did
they
not
prepare
me
for
the
years
to
come?
I
guess
that
I
must
have
been
taught
some
things
throughout
those
years.
Where
else
would
I
learn
the
alphabet
and
numbers?
The
years
until
high
school
seem
to
be
blurred
and
mixed
together.
But
in
high
school,
I
did
not
really
understand
that
I
was
better
than
a
mediocre
writer
until
I
graduated.
And
even
now,
I
did
not
fully
recognize
how
much
I
learned
throughout
high
school
until
I
arrived
at
Lafayette.
The
first
memory
I
have
as
a
writer
is
practicing
drawing
letters.
I
remember
this
only
because
of
the
book
we
used
to
keep
the
correct
form
of
the
letters.
Each
page
had
only
about
4
lines
on
it.
The
reason
there
were
so
few
lines
was
because
each
line
was
about
one
inch
wide.
This
was
no
college-ruled
paper.
Each
line
had
a
dotted
line
through
the
center
of
it.
It
was
placed
there
to
guide
me
as
I
created
each
uppercase
and
lowercase
letter.
The
uppercase
letters
were
to
touch
the
full
line
above,
while
the
lowercase
letters
were
only
to
reach
the
dotted
line
in
the
middle.
I
can
still
picture
myself
sitting
at
a
desk
"drawing"
the
alphabet
with
an
extra
large,
red
pencil.
I
refer
to
this
practice
as
"drawing"
because
at
that
age,
a
person
needed
some
sort
of
artistic
talent
to
create
the
letters
correctly.
If
you
didn't
have
the
talent,
your
were
asked
to
practice
more
at
home.
I
always
had
trouble
drawing
the
number
nine.
The
big,
red
pencils
we
used
were
the
standard.
Throughout
the
years,
the
pencil
has
shrunk
from
a
thick,
red
one
to
the
number
2,
yellow
one
we
use
here
at
Lafayette.
In
third
grade,
I
had
a
teacher
who
I
became
friends
with.
He
watched
me
grow
up
through
the
years
and
we
still
keep
in
touch.
During
my
stint
as
a
third
grader,
I
went
on
a
vacation
with
my
family
to
Hawaii.
I
remember
various
things
about
the
trip
but
more
importantly,
I
remember
keeping
a
journal.
I
actually
still
have
the
journal
and
took
it
out
to
reread
it.
It
was
called
"The
Adventures
of
Mike
Schwartz."
I
did
not
use
pencil
in
the
journal,
but
instead
I
used
erasable
ink.
At
that
time,
erasable
ink
was
the
best
choice
for
young
writers
such
as
myself.
It
allowed
a
more
permanent
finish
to
the
journal
but
still
let
me
alter
it
if
needed.
The
journal
has
a
computer-made
cover
and
pictures
from
my
trip.
My
teacher
even
wrote
a
response
in
it
after
my
family
returned.
It
is
a
fitting
response
in
that
is
says
the
journal
will
help
me
remember
details
that
I
would
not
normally
remember
if
they
were
not
recorded
there.
As
I
reread
my
adventures
in
Hawaii,
some
memories
flooded
into
my
head.
I
still
remember
chickening
out
of
the
parasailing
because
I
was
(and
still
am)
afraid
of
heights.
I
can
remember
the
trip
up
to
the
top
of
a
volcano
and
seeing
a
rainbow
from
my
hotel
room.
I
wrote
this
journal
to
write
my
memories
on
paper.
This
journal
was
not
assigned
and
I
remember
enjoying
working
on
it.
As
I
grew
up,
more
and
more
writing
assignments
were
given
to
me.
One
type
of
assignment
I
clearly
remember
is
the
book
report.
The
book
report
is
the
token
essay
a
student
had
to
write
and
rewrite
in
seventh
and
eighth
grade.
It
was
an
essay
telling
other
students
about
a
book
you
read.
Some
of
the
time,
the
students
were
allowed
to
write
freely
about
the
book.
But
the
most
other
times,
we
were
forced
to
answer
questions
about
how
we
felt,
if
we
would
suggest
this
book
to
a
friend,
and
why.
At
this
time
in
my
life,
I
did
not
like
to
read
or
write.
I
loathed
book
reports
because
I
was
forced
to
do
both.
That
was
when
I
started
to
read
Dean
Koontz.
His
writing
can
be
described
as
horror
tamer
than
the
terror
written
by
Stephen
King.
This
was
the
first
time
I
realized
that
I
could
read
books
that
I
liked
and
then
enjoy
writing
about
them.
It
was
here
that
I
stopped
hating
reading
and
writing
and
slowly
started
to
enjoy
them.
I
have
to
say
that
I
still
am
not
thrilled
with
these
tasks,
but
I
have
learned
to
get
around
those
feelings.
I
learned
that
I
have
to
make
the
assignment
into
something
I
like
to
write
about.
In
my
Social
Studies
classes,
I
remember
having
to
write
about
some
historical
time
period.
I
found
that
if
I
could
find
something
I
liked
from
that
period,
I
had
no
problem
writing
about
it.
When
I
reached
high
school,
I
can't
say
that
I
loved
writing,
but
it
was
moving
up
fast
on
my
list
of
loathes.
During
my
sophomore
year,
I
was
forced
to
take
a
lower
lever
English
class
because
the
higher
level
did
not
fit
into
my
schedule.
I
met
with
the
higher
level
teacher
once
a
week
and
discussed
various
topics,
including
my
writing,
to
keep
me
up
with
the
other
class.
Through
these
meetings,
I
became
friends
with
her.
Then,
my
senior
year,
I
was
enrolled
in
her
class
titled
"UConn
English."
This
class
was
supposed
to
prepare
me
for
college
writing.
And
did
it
ever.
The
class
was
hard,
the
reading
was
difficult,
and
the
discussions
in
class
were
troublesome
and
sometimes
puzzling.
But
because
the
class
was
so
demanding,
I
learned
more
than
I
thought.
The
biggest
reason
why
I
learned
so
much
was
because
our
papers
were
not
graded.
Just
as
we
Writing
Associates
are
not
supposed
to
put
a
grade
on
students'
writing,
my
teacher
did
not
assign
a
grade
to
our
work.
She
graded
our
progression
as
writers.
I
learned
howto
"edit"
papers,
not
just
proofread
them.
I
say
"edit"
because
I
was
not
just
correcting
the
paper.
I
was
giving
the
student
help
in
order
to
revise
the
paper.
The
class
was
split
into
4
groups
of
about
4
students
and
we
each
read
our
papers
aloud.
After
the
paper
was
read,
the
other
students
in
the
group
made
comments
on
howto
better
organize
thoughts
and
ideas.
We
marked
mistakes
in
grammar
and
syntax
and
kept
track
of
our
errors.
We
even
wrote
progress
reports
to
see
how
we
were
improving.
The
"five
paragraph"
essay
that
every
student
learns
no
longer
applied
to
this
class.
It
was
in
this
class
where
I
evolved
as
a
writer.
I
learned
how
to
write
and
write
well.
I
think
that
taking
this
class
was
the
best
experience
I
have
had
as
a
writer.
It
really
woke
me
up
as
a
student
preparing
for
college.
Looking
back
on
high
school,
I
realized
that
most
of
the
classes
were
not
that
difficult.
I
did
not
work
all
that
hard
in
my
classes
and
that
is
because
I
did
not
have
to.
But
UConn
English
really
pushed
me
to
become
the
writer
I
am
today.
When
I
reached
college,
there
were
no
classes
you
could
just
sit
through.
If
I
tried
to
"sleep"
through
classes
in
college,
I
would
fail
them.
Unbeknownst
to
me,
I
was
getting
the
sufficient
background
I
needed
for
Lafayette.
I
did
not
know
how
adequately
I
was
prepared
for
college
until
I
got
to
Lafayette.
"Adequate
preparation"
was
the
idea
that
I
could
write
above
average
papers
and
still
have
the
ability
to
improve
my
writing.
I
was
nervous
heading
into
my
First
Year
Seminar.
I
expected
the
class
to
be
an
extension
of
my
UConn
English
class,
but
nothing
further.
The
reading
list
was
long,
but
interesting.
The
class
read
a
"trashy"
romance
novel
to
compare
it
to
classical
works
like
Shakespeare's
"Romeo
and
Juliet."
We
even
watched
the
modern
movie
version
of
"Romeo
and
Juliet"
to
see
if
the
romance
changed.
I
read
a
book
about
dreams
by
Sigmund
Freud
and
had
to
analyze
one
of
my
own
dreams.
This
was
the
work
I
had
been
waiting
for.
It
was
work
I
liked
to
be
doing.
Work
that
I
found
interesting
and
was
interested
to
write
about.
I
was
not
able
to
take
College
Writing
110
during
the
second
semester
of
my
freshman
year.
Because
it
did
not
fit
into
my
schedule,
I
waited
until
the
Fall
of
my
sophomore
year.
I
did
not
know
what
to
expect
from
this
class.
I
figured
it
would
have
a
lot
of
writing,
something
I
did
not
mind
so
much
anymore.
The
class
did
have
a
lot
of
writing
and
it
was
difficult.
Most
of
the
other
students
in
my
class
did
not
understand
the
material
and
usually
had
a
difficult
time
writing.
I
understood
the
material,
but
still
had
a
hard
time
getting
my
thoughts
on
paper.
I
remember
some
of
the
other
students'
reactions
to
their
own
work.
They
were
always
complaining
that
they
did
not
understand
the
questions
they
were
asked
of
them.
I
visited
my
professor
many
times
during
that
semester.
She
helped
me
get
my
thoughts
organized
and
onto
paper.
She
told
me
that
I
really
helped
the
other
students
when
I
spoke
up
in
class.
She
also
mentioned
that
I'd
make
a
good
Writing
Associate
and
that
I
should
think
about
applying.
Because
I
was
to
travel
abroad
in
the
Spring,
I
knew
I'd
have
to
wait
for
the
Fall
to
get
a
chance
to
apply.
I
basically
applied
from
Europe
and
my
College
Writing
110
professor
helped
me
get
the
application
together.
It
finally
hit
me
that
she
was
sticking
with
me
even
though
I
was
away.
There
were
plenty
of
applicants,
why
would
I
make
a
difference?
I
realized
that
I
was
good
at
helping
other
people
with
their
writing.
I
think
my
ability
to
be
a
good
Writing
Associate
originated
from
my
preparedness
during
my
senior
year
of
high
school.
The
college-prep
course
I
took
really
taught
me
how
to
"edit"
papers
and
how
to
help
people
with
their
work.
In
high
school,
I
knew
that
I
wanted
to
work
in
Math
and
the
Sciences
more
than
I
wanted
to
even
deal
with
History
and
English.
My
teachers
in
high
school
even
told
me
that
I
would
not
have
to
write
much
as
an
engineer.
So
as
long
as
I
was
proficient,
I
would
have
no
trouble.
I
do
not
like
being
"proficient"
in
anything
I
do.
It
is
how
I
am
and
how
I
will
always
be.
Being
an
engineering
major,
I
am
not
required
to
take
any
other
English
classes
in
college
besides
the
two
my
freshman
year.
The
only
problem
I
see
with
that
now
is
that
people
need
to
write
well
no
matter
what
profession
they
are
in.
When
I
am
looking
for
a
career
after
college,
I
want
to
be
able
to
have
an
edge
over
the
other
candidates.
Being
able
to
write
well
is
important
to
every
company
and
I
think
that
my
writing
abilities
will
help
me
get
a
better
job.
The
turning
point
in
my
writing
career
must
have
been
in
my
senior
year
in
high
school.
The
English
class
I
took
then
really
shaped
me
into
the
writer
I
am
today.
Without
it,
I
do
not
know
where
my
writing
would
have
taken
me.
My
history
as
a
writer
will
forever
continue
and
cannot
be
concluded
at
this
moment.
When
I
finish
this
semester
as
a
Writing
Associate,
I
will
be
able
to
add
more
to
my
"story."
But
until
then,
I
will
have
to
wait
for
more
experiences
and
adventures
as
a
reader,
writer
and
Writing
Associate.
