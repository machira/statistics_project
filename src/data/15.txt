History

My
history
as
a
writer
can
be
divided
into
two
clearly
defined
periods:
disliking
and
enjoying
writing.
The
transition
from
not
liking
to
appreciating
writing
occurred
in
the
eighth
grade,
when
I
was
first
seriously
introduced
into
the
world
of
academic
writing.
The
academic
writing
I
did
before
the
eighth
grade
consisted
of
book
report
type
papers
and
creative
writing
assignments.
I
did
not
mind
doing
book
reports
only
because,
while
I
despised
writing,
I
adored
reading.
I
remember
in
the
second
grade,
it
seemed
as
though
I
read
books
at
a
faster
pace
than
my
teacher
could
supply
them
for
me.
Unfortunately,
as
much
as
I
loved
reading,
I
disliked
writing.
I
thought
of
book
reports
as
nothing
more
than
factual
regurgitation.
I
saw
book
reports
as
the
tail
end
of
a
larger
reading
assignment.
In
that
way,
I
never
made
the
distinction
between
reading
and
writing.
To
me,
book
reports
just
seemed
to
be
a
way
for
the
teacher
to
make
sure
I
had
done
my
assignment.
I
had
no
concept
of
writing
for
writing's
sake.
Even
when
I
was
asked
to
do
a
report
on
an
historical
personage,
my
focus
was
not
on
the
writing.
Rather,
writing
was
my
medium
for
completing
the
assignment.
I
never
conciously
considered
form
or
style
beyond
grammar
and
punctutation.
My
focus
rested
entirely
on
content.
I
proofread
my
work,
but
only
to
make
sure
it
was
grammaticaly
correct.
Perhaps
in
the
fifth
or
sixth
grade,
as
I
got
older
and
started
to
write
compositions,
my
focus
shifted
to
vocabulary.
I
consider
the
composition
exercises
the
earliest
roots
of
writing
because
I
began
to
develop
a
particular
diction
which
I
used
regularly
in
my
writing.
My
writing
began
to
take
on
a
style
of
its
own.
Although
I
started
to
cultivate
a
writing
style,
I
was
far
from
developing
an
identity.
My
style
mimicked
the
style
of
the
texts
I
read.
In
trying
to
sound
mature,
I
wrote
formally.
While
my
teachers
constantly
complimented
my
writing
abilities,
I
had
no
self-confidence
because
I
had
no
identity.
It
was
not
until
the
end
of
junior
high,
in
the
eighth
grade,
that
I
began
to
enjoy
writing.
I
was
starting
to
read
more
advanced
works,
so
naturally
the
compositions
I
was
writing
were
more
challenging.
I
remember
the
first
piece
of
writing
that
really
impressed
my
teacher.
I
had
read
Lorraine
Hansberry's
A
Raisin
in
the
Sun
for
my
english
class,
and
I
was
assigned
an
actual
essay
on
it.
The
essay
was
supposed
to
be
two
pages,
front
and
back.
It
was
due
on
a
Monday
and,
needless
to
say,
I
spent
all
of
Sunday
working
on
it.
I
handed
the
paper
in
on
Monday
morning,
and
although
I
put
substantial
time
and
effort
into
it
(for
an
eighth
grader,
at
least),
I
felt
unsettled
about
it.
Looking
back
now,
that
uneasy
feeling
probably
arose
from
the
advanced
nature
of
the
assignment.
It
the
first
essay
of
its
kind
I
was
ever
asked
to
write,
complete
with
quotes
and
concrete
support
for
my
ideas.
That
Friday,
when
Mr.
Stone
handed
back
the
essays,
he
made
a
preliminary
announcement.
He
said
that
the
papers
needed
a
lot
more
work,
that
with
a
few
exceptions,
we
were
not
pushing
ourselves.
I
was
terrified.
As
he
walked
around
the
room,
returning
the
neophyte
writers'
first
attempts
at
academic
writing,
I
felt
certain
that
my
paper
was
in
the
needs
work
category.
Mr.
Stone
approached
the
table
I
was
seated
at
and
began
distributing
papers.
When
he
got
to
mine,
he
opened
his
mouth
to
say
something,
and
I
felt
the
blood
rush
to
my
face.
I
was
embarrassed
already.
2
My
imagination
was
running
wild
with
possible
humiliations.
Instead,
Mr.
Stone
paid
me
one
of
the
biggest
and
most
inspriational
compliments
of
my
life.
He
said,
Elisa,
this
paper
looks
like
it
should
have
been
written
by
a
senior.
A
what?
Did
he
really
say
senior?
I
was
in
a
state
of
shock
for
a
few
brief
moments
before
I
mustered
up
the
ability
to
say
thank
you.
For
an
eighth
grader,
being
compared
to
a
senior
is
just
about
the
greatest
compliment
one
can
ever
hope
for.
Perhaps
the
compliment
was
even
more
extraordinary
because
it
came
from
Mr.
Stone,
who
had
a
reputation
for
being
especialy
tough.
Whatever
the
case,
that
compliment
encouraged
me
to
go
further
with
my
writing
in
high
school.
High
school
was
the
most
critical
time
for
the
development
of
my
writing,
it
was
in
high
school
that
I
decided
I
did
not
like
to
write
creatively,
and
realized
that
my
true
skill
was
in
academic
writing.
My
sophomore
year
of
high
school,
I
did
not
do
very
well
in
my
English
class.
Most
of
the
writing
we
did
in
my
English
class
was
creative.
I
had
no
background
in
creative
writing
and
certainly
did
not
feel
qualified
to
match
either
the
authors
I
read
or
my
peers.
I
remember
having
to
keep
a
journal
for
my
english
class
and
feeling
very
embarrassed
by
it.
The
whole
creative
writing
experience
my
sophomore
year
turned
me
off
to
writing.
I
took
some
interesting
courses
my
junior
year,
and
renewed
my
interest.
The
focus
of
the
writing
in
the
courses
I
took
returned
to
academic
writing.
The
true
turning
point
of
my
writing
career,
and
to
some
degree,
of
my
life,
came
during
my
senior
year
of
high
school.
Senior
year,
I
took
two
courses
which
changed
my
life.
Because
of
these
courses,
I
developed
a
love
for
writing.
The
courses
impressed
me
so
strongly
that
I
decided
to
become
an
English
major
in
college.
One
of
the
courses
was
Modern
Drama.
After
each
play
was
completed,
among
other
assignments,
we
were
given
a
choice
of
one
of
six
essays
to
write.
I
found
the
topics
so
interesting
that
I
often
wanted
to
write
more
than
one.
My
writing
was
constantly
improving.
I
particularly
remember
the
last
essay
I
had
to
write.
It
concerned
Peter
Shaffer's
Equus.
I
put
a
lot
of
thought
into
my
essay,
but
it
was
not
agonizing
writing.
Rather,
it
came
naturally.
I
revised
it
once
and
handed
it
in.
When
it
was
returned
to
me,
it
was
accompanied
by
some
extremely
fulfilling
remarks.
My
teacher,
Mr.
Windor,
wrote
to
me,
May
I
adress
you
as
Dr.
Bomengo?
Mr.
Windor
had
been
at
my
high
school
for
over
twenty-five
years
and
was
a
very
well
respected
man.
If
he
told
me
that
my
writing
was
advancing,
I
certainly
believed
him.
This
was
an
important
milestone
not
just
because
of
Mr.
Windor's
remark,
but
because
it
was
the
first
time
that
writing
came
naturally
to
me.
At
the
same
time
as
I
was
taking
Modern
Drama,
I
was
taking
A.P
English.
This
was
the
single
most
influential
course
I
have
ever
taken.
I
truly
felt
that
I
was
pushing
my
abilities
to
their
outermost
boundaries.
All
the
writing
I
did
was
academic,
most
of
it
in
preparation
for
the
A.P
examination.
When
I
entered
the
class
in
September,
I
considered
myself
a
decent
writer
with
a
lot
of
potential.
By
the
end
of
the
year,
when
I
took
the
A.P.
exam,
I
felt
as
though
I
had
come
into
my
own
as
a
writer.
Before
I
took
the
course,
I
thought
writing
was
a
talent
that
one
either
had
or
did
not
have.
Through
this
course,
I
realized
that
while
some
people
are
more
inclined
towards
writing,
it
is
a
learning
process.
Some
people
have
a
special
gift
that
enables
them
to
write
well
naturally,
while
others
acquire
an
ability
to
write
through
trial
and
error.
In
preparation
for
the
A.P.
examination,
we
were
trained
in
writing
essays
in
a
forty-five
minute
period.
The
essays
were
to
be
complete
yet
concise.
By
the
time
I
took
the
A.P.
exam,
I
felt
well
qualified
to
write
the
essays.
That
was
primarily
because
I
had
so
much
practice.
We
had
at
least
one
take
home
essay
which
we
were
supposed
to
complete
in
forty
five
minutes,
and
sometimes
in
class
essays
as
well.
It
was
through
these
essays
that
I
learned
the
rules
of
academic
writing.
Ever
since
my
senior
year,
I
have
had
a
sincere
respect
for
academic
and
professional
writing.
For
a
while,
I
thought
I
wanted
to
be
a
writing
critic.
My
desire
to
examine
writing
got
so
intense
that
I
could
no
longer
read
something
simply
at
its
face
value.
I
read
everything
for
form
as
well
as
content.
When
I
read
articles
in
newspapers
and
magazines,
I
often
thought
of
what
I
would
do
differently.
I
think
I
lost
some
of
my
heavy
criticism
in
college,
when
I
sympathized
with
the
pressure
of
deadlines
under
which
writers
work.
Unfortunately,
I
think
my
writing
was
in
peak
form
at
the
end
of
my
senior
year
of
high
school.
I
had
the
most
practice
at
that
time
due
to
the
A.P
exam.
In
college,
I
did
not
have
the
same
amount
of
time
to
devote
to
my
work.
In
high
school,
if
I
had
a
five
page
paper
due,
it
was
most
likely
that
I
had
minimal
assignments
due
in
other
classes.
In
college,
it
has
been
my
experience
that
my
work
all
comes
at
the
same
time.
There
simply
are
not
enough
hours
in
the
day
for
me
to
devote
the
time
and
energy
that
I
would
like
to
my
writing.
My
love
for
writing
has
not
diminshed
at
all,
even
though
the
time
I
have
given
to
my
writing
has.
In
college,
I
have
supplemented
the
lack
of
opportunity
for
good
writing
with
tutoring
and
my
position
as
a
writing
associate.
Last
year,
I
began
to
tutor
through
the
tutoring
office
in
Hogg
Hall.
I
was
appalled
by
the
lack
of
writing
skills
of
one
of
the
tutees.
Through
that
experience,
I
reinforced
my
most
basic
writing
skills.
However,
I
had
one
tutee
who
was
an
international
student.
I
found
that
experience
particularly
fulfilling
because
while
he
did
need
some
help
with
grammar,
he
mainly
wanted
help
with
word
manipulations.
He
wanted
to
perfect
his
diction,
so
we
did
a
lot
of
tightening
in
his
essays.
I
love
revising
papers
and
his
papers
were
at
the
point
where
we
could
really
get
into
some
productive
revising.
Last
year,
I
worked
as
a
Biology
W.A.
I
found
that
position
particularly
fulfilling
because
the
writing
I
was
working
with
was
purely
academic.
The
aim
of
the
biology
papers
is
to
be
as
precise,
concise,
and
accurate
as
possible.
I
did
a
lot
of
sentence
tightening
with
the
students.
We
also
worked
with
diction
to
find
the
most
expressive
and
concise
words.
I
am
hoping
to
keep
building
on
my
present
skills
this
year
through
my
new
position
as
a
writing
associate.
