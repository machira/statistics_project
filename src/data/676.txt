In
preparing
to
write
this
assignment,
I
first
took
a
look
back
at
the
reflection
I
wrote
in
preparation
for
my
first
year
as
a
Writing
Associate.
In
doing
so
it
is
clear
to
me
how
much
my
background
in
writing
has
affected
how
I
work
in
college
and
also
how
much
being
at
Lafayette
has
influenced
my
style
of
writing
and
how
I
approach
assignments.
I
remember
feeling
freshman
year
that
I
was
sufficiently
prepared
and
confident
in
my
writing
abilities
and
skills
and
was
able
to
handle
the
demands
asked
of
me
by
my
professors
with
confidence.
Sophomore
year
however,
proved
to
be
a
different
story.
My
classes
were
more
a
mixture
of
upper
classmen,
most
majors
in
English
who
already
had
previous
experience
with
higher-level
courses.
I
also
had
the
added
responsibility
of
being
a
Writing
Associate
for
a
First
Year
Seminar
in
the
fall
and
an
Economics
class
in
the
spring.
While
freshman
year
at
Lafayette
was
for
me
about
adjusting
to
college
life
and
the
demands
required
by
college
professors,
my
sophomore
year
at
Lafayette
was
about
taking
on
new
challenges
and
expanding
upon
what
I
had
learned
freshman
year.
Starting
my
first
300
level
English
courses,
I
was
not
apprehensive.
I
was
still
sure
in
my
capabilities
and
while
I
knew
that
it
was
a
more
advanced
course
than
I
had
taken
last
year,
I
was
not
daunted.
Upon
the
return
of
my
first
assignment
for
that
course
however,
I
was
suddenly
made
very
much
aware
that
this
class
and
this
professor
demanded
much
more
of
my
attention
and
writing
skills
than
I
had
thought.
Although
I
have
always
loved
reading
and
writing
and
consider
writing
to
be
one
of
my
strong
suits,
I
have
not
always
met
with
instant
success
in
my
school
career.
As
I
mentioned
in
my
first
reflection
for
the
College
Writing
Program,
one
particular
English
teacher
that
I
had
in
high
school
was
the
first
to
really
push
me
further
in
writing
and
show
me
that
I
had
the
potential
to
do
better.
At
first
I
was
extremely
frustrated
with
what
I
considered
to
be
my
lack
of
success
in
the
classes
that
I
had
with
this
specific
teacher.
This
same
frustration
I
felt
in
my
first
300
level
English
courses
at
Lafayette
the
previous
semester.
I
found
myself
participating
in
class
and
enjoying
the
texts
assigned
in
the
class.
My
attitude
towards
the
first
writing
due
in
the
class
was
complacent;
based
on
my
experiences
freshman
year
I
was
confident
that
I
could
easily
succeed.
Upon
receiving
this
first
paper
back
in
the
class
my
complacency
was
shattered.
Although
not
terrible
or
failing,
the
grade
that
I
received
was
less
than
what
I
was
happy
with
or
concerned
acceptable
for
myself.
More
than
just
the
letter
grade,
I
was
disappointed
with
myself
and
felt
that
I
was
capable
of
going
more
in
depth.
Throughout
this
specific
course
I
took
each
writing
assignment
and
the
comments
I
received
on
each
one
and
rather
than
be
discouraged,
I
decided
to
rise
to
the
challenges
my
professor
presented
to
me.
As
the
semester
progressed,
I
found
that
the
critiques
I
had
received
on
previous
papers
helped
guide
and
focus
my
direction
on
subsequent
papers.
The
last
paper
I
had
to
write
for
the
course
showed
the
improvements
I
had
learned
over
the
semester.
Another
dimension
to
my
writing
experiences
this
past
year
was
the
fact
that
I
had
the
added
responsibility
of
being
a
WA.
My
feelings
about
this
were
ambivalent;
I
was
both
excited
about
working
with
my
fellow
students
and
apprehensive.
My
main
concern
was
whether
or
not
I
would
be
able
to
know
what
advice
to
give
to
my
peers;
how
could
I
accurately
gage
their
papers
if
I
still
was
working
on
my
own
writing?
The
answer
to
this
question
became
clear
to
me
as
I
worked
with
students
and
participated
in
my
own
classes.
When
it
comes
to
writing
abilities,
there
is
never
a
point
where
improvement
cannot
be
made,
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
good
writing
is
impossible.
Once
I
had
accepted
this
fact
and
believed
that,
then
it
felt
more
natural
and
comfortable
for
me
to
comment
and
critique
the
writing
of
my
peers.
I
saw
first
hand
the
benefit
of
having
a
second
pair
of
eyes
looking
over
what
you
have
written;
an
outside
fresh
perspective
that
at
a
distance
could
objectively
judge.
I
witnessed
this
for
the
first
time
in
the
fall
with
the
First
Year
Seminar
that
I
had
been
assigned
to
work
with.
The
seminar
was
called
Charisma
and
the
students
focused
on
the
power
and
pull
that
charismatic
people
throughout
history
had
and
what
exactly
the
definition
of
charisma
was.
For
their
first
assignment,
the
students
had
to
pick
a
charismatic
figure
or
group
in
history
and
show
why
they
could
be
considered
charismatic
and
what
effect
this
quality
had
on
the
people
around
them.
When
I
met
with
the
freshman
for
the
first
round
of
conferences,
I
already
had
an
idea
in
my
head
about
how
I
would
respond
to
the
assignmentOs
writing
prompt
and
the
direction
that
I
felt
to
be
most
appropriate
for
the
paper
to
focus
on.
What
I
found
to
be
surprising
was
that
for
some
students,
my
ideas
of
a
response
helped
to
give
them
a
focus
on
their
own
and
for
other
students
that
I
had
conference
with
my
preconceived
notions
about
the
best
response
to
the
assignment
were
not
the
only
way
to
approach
it
and
by
combining
both
of
our
visions
a
better
response
was
formulated.
The
experience
from
my
first
conference
became
a
trend
throughout
the
rest
of
my
conferences
that
year
and
it
truly
became
clear
to
me
that
being
a
WA
not
only
allowed
me
to
help
other
students
but
also
to
help
myself.
Through
our
weekly
staff
meetings
and
the
advice
of
other
returning
Was,
I
learned
what
to
look
for
and
focus
on
when
reviewing
a
paper
for
a
peer,
however
I
found
myself
using
these
editing
techniques
more
and
more
when
revising
my
own
work.
I
already
knew
that
revision
was
an
essential
part
of
the
writing
process
but
the
attention
I
gave
it
increased
after
being
a
WA.
From
our
initial
WA
staff
meetings
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
I
learned
that
there
was
a
priority
level
for
what
to
look
out
for
and
comment
on
in
a
personOs
paper.
Where
as
before
I
would
tend
to
get
bogged
down
in
the
minutiae
of
grammar
or
vocabulary,
now
I
learned
to
consider
those
things
important
but
secondary
to
the
overall
organization
and
content
of
the
paper.
One
example
of
this
approach
to
editing
comes
from
an
experience
that
I
had
with
a
student
in
our
drop-in
service
hours.
This
particular
student
was
an
international
student
and
it
was
extremely
tempting
for
me
to
focus
only
on
the
grammar
mistakes
and
the
incorrect
phrasing
of
some
of
the
sentences
or
words.
The
student
too
was
happy
to
let
me
play
spell
checker
like
a
real
life
incarnation
of
the
automated
tool
in
a
word
document;
his
view
of
the
what
a
WA
should
do
is
be
there
to
instantly
fix
mistakes
and
proof
read.
However,
as
the
meeting
progressed
I
realized
that
although
I
was
focusing
most
of
my
attention
on
the
grammar,
the
overarching
structure
of
the
paper
needed
work
as
well
as
the
main
argument
that
this
particular
student
was
trying
to
prove
in
the
paper.
Here
is
where
WAs
have
the
difficult
job
of
drawing
a
thin
line:
how
much
is
too
much
help
to
give
and
when
do
grammatical
mistakes
begin
to
overshadow
the
main
argument
of
the
paper?
You
could
argue
that
grammar
and
correct
vocabulary
are
a
higher
concern;
certainly
for
this
particular
student,
if
they
could
not
correctly
and
coherently
express
their
argument
to
their
audience
then
the
point
that
they
were
actually
arguing
ceases
to
really
matter
in
comparison
to
the
mechanics
of
the
paper.
However,
many
times
in
our
staff
meeting
we
would
discuss
how
to
actively
engage
our
student
in
the
WA
conference,
not
just
sit
them
down
and
list
all
of
the
errors
in
the
paper
and
the
corrections
that
WA
had
already
made.
We
decided
that
it
was
essential
for
the
student
to
be
involved
in
the
conference
so
that
they
could
really
understand
the
right
way
to
approach
certain
elements
of
the
paper
that
before
they
were
having
trouble
with.
We
did
not
want
to
be
service,
which
fed
our
peers
the
correct
answers
and
instead
wanted
to
have
them
process
the
information
and
really
understand
what
to
do
or
not
to
do
to
create
a
successful
paper.
Many
times
during
my
drop-in
service
hours
I
would
encounter
students
who
expected
to
drop
their
paper
and
have
it
returned
error
free
and
ready
to
receive
a
good
grade.
However,
once
I
sat
next
to
them
with
their
paper
between
us,
going
over
each
paragraph
or
section
with
them,
it
felt
really
rewarding
to
see
a
shift
or
transformation
in
their
understanding
of
what
they
had
written
and
what
they
had
wanted
to
write.
Probably
the
best
feeling
that
I
got
from
being
a
WA
was
when
the
student
I
was
working
with
finally
was
able
to
formulate
what
they
had
really
wanted
to
say,
get
across
the
point
they
really
were
trying
to
communicate.
Seeing
that
moment
of
breakthrough
in
a
conference
made
me
aware
of
why
I
enjoyed
being
a
WA
so
much.
As
the
year
progressed,
I
became
more
and
more
comfortable
with
my
role
as
WA
and
felt
that
I
was
actually
being
useful
to
my
freshman
students.
With
each
conference
I
felt
more
comfortable
and
surer
of
how
to
handle
certain
problems
that
arose.
One
thing
that
being
a
WA
also
helped
me
with
outside
of
the
College
Writing
Program
was
learning
how
to
be
more
comfortable
with
talking
to
professors.
Freshman
year
I
was
hesitant
to
approach
my
professors
for
help.
They
did
not
intimidate
me,
but
I
did
not
want
to
show
them
that
I
was
unsure.
I
believed
that
I
needed
to
have
all
the
right
answers
already
figured
out
and
present
a
sure
front
to
my
professors.
If
I
struggled
through
the
process
of
writing
a
paper,
I
did
not
want
it
to
show
in
the
end
result.
However,
since
working
with
professors
that
I
had
to
WA
for,
I
have
learned
that
communicating
my
questions
or
problems
is
not
something
to
be
avoided
but
encouraged.
Creating
a
dialogue
with
your
professors
allows
you
to
have
an
added
resource
of
help
while
writing
as
well
as
allowing
your
professors
to
better
understand
your
own
writing
and
the
problem
areas
that
they
can
help
you
with.
The
first
professor
I
worked
with
for
my
FYS
was
difficult
to
reach.
He
rarely
responded
to
emails
and
phone
calls
and
I
became
a
little
concerned,
as
I
was
eager
for
direction
about
what
he
expected
from
his
WA.
I
emailed
and
left
a
message
and
after
a
few
days
I
finally
realized
that
I
had
to
just
go
see
him
in
person.
This
may
not
seem
like
such
a
milestone
to
the
outside
observer,
but
for
me
I
was
still
hesitant
and
nervous
about
approaching
professors.
Finally
meeting
with
him
and
communicating
with
this
professor
proved
to
be
essential
for
me
to
be
a
successful
WA
for
this
particular
FYS.
I
learned
from
this
experience
that
while
a
WA
may
not
physically
be
in
the
classroom,
they
still
need
to
be
aware
of
what
is
going
on
with
the
class
and
what
the
professorOs
goals
are.
I
learned
from
my
own
two
classes
that
I
was
a
WA
for
and
hearing
from
my
fellow
Was
in
staff
meetings
that
there
are
professors
who
expect
more
involvement
and
discussion
from
their
Was
and
others
who
feel
that
the
two
are
working
parallel
to
each
other.
What
is
important
though
is
establishing
some
relationship
with
your
partner
professor
so
the
students
are
not
receiving
missed
messages.
In
my
own
classes
I
saw
a
reflection
of
this
newfound
willingness
to
communicate
with
professors.
In
one
of
my
second
semester
English
classes,
another
300
level,
I
started
out
very
much
intimidated
by
my
professor.
I
felt
that
he
was
just
so
intelligent
that
I
was
afraid
of
sounding
ignorant
or
foolish
if
I
asked
a
question.
However,
I
realized
that
to
be
successful
in
the
class
I
would
have
to
communicate
with
my
professor
and
that
I
shouldnOt
be
so
self-conscious
about
not
understanding
everything.
As
I
experienced
with
my
partner
professors,
this
certain
professor
actually
encouraged
dialogue
and
was
more
than
willing
to
meet
with
me
and
truly
wanted
me
to
understand
what
he
was
trying
to
communicate
with
the
class.
This
experience
brings
me
to
my
final
and
probably
overarching
lesson
learned
from
my
first
year
as
a
WA.
All
my
encounters,
both
personal
and
professionally
with
other
students,
have
culminated
to
this
point:
it
is
okay
not
to
be
perfect.
As
a
writer,
I
have
always
been
harder
on
myself
than
others.
This
is
why
as
a
young
writer
I
was
resistant
to
revision
and
why
I
hesitated
talking
to
professors.
I
tend
to
believe
that
I
need
to
present
a
polished
front
to
the
world
and
my
professors,
but
by
being
a
WA
and
working
with
students
on
their
papers
and
discussions
with
other
Was
in
staff
meetings,
I
have
learned
that
the
journey
to
perfection
is
just
as
valuable
if
not
more
so
than
the
perfect
finish
line.
All
the
work
that
goes
into
the
end
product
is
reveals
so
much
about
each
writerOs
style,
strengths,
and
weaknesses.
By
being
a
witness
to
the
writing
process
of
others,
it
has
allowed
me
to
be
more
self-
aware
about
my
own
strengths
and
weaknesses
and
to
be
more
comfortable
with
imperfection.
I
have
grown
as
a
writer
since
my
freshman
year
and
although
the
details
of
junior
year
wait
to
be
revealed
to
me,
I
know
for
sure
that
I
will
continue
to
grow
from
the
experiences
I
will
have.
