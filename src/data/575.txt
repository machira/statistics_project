Starting
in
elementary
school
and
continuing
today
writing
has
taken
a
dramatic
turn
from
my
focus
on
writing
as
an
appearance
to
writing
as
a
formative
way
to
express
and
share
my
ideas.
Throughout
the
years
my
writing
has
changed
and
evolved
with
influences
from
my
peers,
teachers,
professors,
and
even
my
own
reflection.
I
have
to
admit,
however,
that
in
developing
my
writing
style
I
have
struggled
with
conflicting
comments
on
my
writing
reflected
in
grades
as
well
as
my
own
somewhat
harsh
personal
critique
of
my
writing.
So
I
guess
my
writing
narrative
is
somewhat
of
a
rocky
road,
but
I
think
that
every
time
I
have
questioned
how
and
why
I
am
writing
and
have
ended
up
in
frustration,
my
skills
as
a
writer
have
improved.
At
the
very
beginning
of
my
writing
debut
in
elementary
school,
I
viewed
writing
as
handwriting
practice
or
more
of
an
art
project
than
anything.
For
me,
writing
was
not
about
sharing
my
ideas
or
creating
a
story,
but
it
was
more
about
presentation.
I
continually
asked
myself
if
my
handwriting
was
as
perfect
as
it
could
be
or
if
I
pasted
the
lined
paper
perfectly
onto
the
construction
paper
I
chose
as
a
background.
Presentation
was
so
imperative
to
me
that
White
Out
wasnOt
acceptable
to
use
on
white
paper,
and
so
I
would
just
write
the
story
I
had
originally
erred
on
all
over
again
on
a
new
sheet
of
paper
fixing
the
mistake
I
had
made;
my,
I
was
quite
the
paper
waster
back
then.
While
this
seems
OCD
to
me
now,
I
like
to
label
myself
as
more
of
a
perfectionist
because
I
think
it
was
my
drive
for
perfection
that
continued
to
develop
in
my
writing
style
even
after
my
OCD
battle
against
White
Out
subsided.
Towards
the
end
of
elementary
school
in
fifth
grade
I
had
the
same
teacher
as
I
had
in
second
grade.
She
was
one
of
my
favorite
teachers
of
all
time,
strict
and
challenging
but
always
willing
to
recognize
hard
work.
The
difference,
however,
between
second
grade
and
fifth
grade
writing
styles
and
focuses
was
drastic.
By
the
time
fifth
grade
came
around,
everyoneOs
handwriting
was
replaced
with
the
computer
and
writing
began
to
integrate
outside
sources.
I
remember
my
first
research
project
was
a
biography
of
Abigail
Adams.
By
approaching
the
research
paper
writing
genre
as
more
of
a
history
subject,
I
think
I
understood
research
papers
as
history
projects
more
than
anything.
To
me,
writing
a
research
paper
was
the
process
of
reporting
historical
facts
rather
than
presenting
research
and
constructing
my
own
ideas
from
existing
facts.
In
middle
school
I
found
comfort
in
research
papers,
which
became
a
primary
focus
in
my
English
classes.
I
think
that
relying
on
research
rather
than
my
own
ideas
to
construct
a
paper
was
not
only
easier,
but
more
of
a
relief
that
other
peopleOs
ideas
were
being
graded,
not
my
own.
In
a
way
research
papers
were
easy
for
me
to
hide
my
ideas,
and
being
the
self-conscious
middle
school
student
I
was,
this
was
okay
for
me.
When
persuasive
papers
were
introduced
to
me
in
my
late
middle
school
years
and
early
high
school
career,
I
finally
started
to
express
my
own
ideas
regarding
controversial
issues.
For
the
first
time
in
my
writing
career,
I
felt
strongly
about
what
I
wrote
because
the
paper
focused
on
the
argumentOs
construction
and
support,
three
aspects
of
writing
that
I
had
always
excelled
at
because
they
involved
organization.
In
writing
persuasive
arguments
my
opinion
was
required,
and
as
long
as
my
ideas
were
logically
supported,
my
ultimate
opinion
didnOt
matter.
I
could
take
whatever
side
of
an
argument
I
wanted
to,
share
my
ideas,
and
not
be
judged
by
my
ideas.
Instead,
I
was
graded
on
the
organization
and
support
of
my
argument,
two
aspects
of
writing
that
I
had
always
been
exceptional
at.
Persuasive
writing
became
a
passage
by
which
I
became
confident
in
my
abilities
as
a
writer.
When
I
arrived
in
high
school
my
freshman
year
I
was
so
scared
that
every
class
would
incorporate
so
much
writing
that
I
would
not
be
able
to
keep
up
with
my
work.
My
perfectionist
mentality
increased
the
time
it
took
me
to
write
papers
to
an
inefficient
number
of
hours.
Constructing
every
sentence
took
a
lot
of
thought
for
me,
and
so
writing
became
more
stressful
than
it
had
at
any
other
time
in
my
education
career.
Writing
was
not
just
concentrated
in
English
class
anymore;
writing
was
the
basis
of
all
my
classes.
However,
I
think
with
the
pressure
to
write
more
papers
for
all
subjects
forced
me
to
develop
a
more
timely
method
of
organizing
my
ideas
and
constructing
papers
rather
than
just
writing
papers.
In
my
sophomore
year
of
high
school
I
started
to
use
organizational
charts
and
outlines
to
organize
my
thoughts
into
a
logical
format.
For
the
first
time
in
my
writing
career
I
took
brainstorming
before
writing
very
seriously.
Even
though
arranging
my
ideas
into
an
outline
took
more
time
initially,
I
found
that
it
was
easier
and
more
time
efficient
for
me
to
actually
write
a
paper
after
I
outlined
the
paper.
Up
until
sophomore
year,
I
never
really
experienced
any
real
critical
comments
on
my
writing;
in
general,
teachers
always
liked
my
writing,
I
received
good
grades
on
papers
throughout
school,
and
my
parents
applauded
my
grades
more
than
taking
an
interest
in
what
type
of
writing
was
receiving
these
grades.
Sophomore
year
in
high
school,
however,
knocked
me
off
my
high
horse.
My
teacher
at
the
time
was
known
to
be
one
of
the
hardest
English
teachers
at
my
high
school,
and
after
I
received
my
first
paper
back
from
her,
I
understood
why.
I
think
my
grade
was
a
B,
which
was
absolutely
a
decent
grade,
but
what
scared
me
were
the
comments
she
wrote
literally
filling
the
margins
of
the
paper.
Her
comments
ranged
from
critiquing
my
lack
of
transitions
to
analyzing
the
structure
of
my
paragraphs
and
even
individual
sentences.
I
had
always
gotten
away
with
being
a
wordy
writer
and
including
question
words
like
NwhichO
or
NhowO
here
and
there
in
my
papers,
but
now
those
words
were
unacceptable.
I
really
believe
that
my
sophomore
year
of
high
school
became
a
pivotal
moment
in
my
writing
career.
I
received
more
feedback
than
I
ever
had
on
little
errs
throughout
my
papers,
but
all
my
mistakes
were
explained
to
me
either
on
the
paper
itself
or
in
after
school
help
sessions
I
attended.
I
think
I
received
one
NAO
on
a
paper
that
entire
year
in
English,
but
I
ha
vet
o
say,
that
was
one
of
my
proudest
moments,
not
because
of
my
grade,
but
because
my
writing
was
the
most
concise,
intelligent,
complex,
and
thought-provoking
piece
of
work
I
had
ever
done.
I
was
finally
a
mature
writer.
One
problem
I
faced
in
being
a
mature
writer
was
that
I
took
the
complexity
I
could
now
write
about
too
far
in
certain
circumstances.
At
times
I
tried
to
use
too
many
consecutive
transitions,
I
tried
to
apply
symbolism
to
every
literary
critique
I
made,
and
in
trying
to
write
complex
papers,
I
often
wrote
papers
that
seemed
to
make
sense
to
me
but
did
not
logically
flow
for
an
outside
reader.
I
went
into
the
SATOs
junior
year
with
a
confidence
that
I
was
a
very
good
writer
who
could
construct
and
express
very
mature
ideas
through
writing.
I
took
the
SATs
the
first
year
there
was
a
writing
component
calculated
into
the
score,
and
I
just
remember
being
excited
to
excel
at
the
short
essay
portion
of
the
test.
I
donOt
exactly
remember
what
the
prompt
was,
but
I
do
remember
it
being
manageable
to
answer
in
25
minutes,
which
was
the
allotted
time
for
this
section.
When
I
received
my
scores
back,
I
was
actually
surprised
that
I
didnOt
receive
a
higher
score.
I
thought
that
my
paper
was
mature,
organized,
and
used
a
lot
of
various
sources
to
support
my
claim.
The
second
time
I
took
the
SATs,
I
wrote
what
I
would
consider
very
simple
paragraphs
that
supported
my
claim,
and
I
ended
up
scoring
higher
than
I
had
the
first
time.
Now
even
though
the
writing
section
of
the
SATOs
is
hard
to
standardize
and
many
disputed
that
scores
were
inconsistent,
I
think
the
two
different
scores
gave
me
insight
into
my
writing
style.
I
began
to
notice
that
I
had
a
tendency
of
making
prompts
more
complex
than
they
needed
to
be.
I
tried
to
answer
questions
and
form
arguments
by
using
complex
examples
rather
than
applying
simple,
strong
supporting
paragraphs.
I
tried
so
hard
to
write
at
the
next
level,
but
in
doing
so,
I
lost
track
of
making
my
writing
logical;
my
writing
had
become
so
formal
that
it
wasnOt
easily
readable.
Towards
the
end
of
my
junior
year
in
high
school
I
started
to,
however,
I
took
on
a
different
type
of
writing
that
was
much
less
formal;
I
began
to
write
in
a
personal
journal
whenever
I
wanted
to.
For
me
writing
had
always
been
about
due
dates,
answering
a
prompt,
and
receiving
a
grade,
but
now
it
became
an
outlet
for
any
feeling
I
was
having
at
the
time.
Writing
became
a
hobby
of
mine
instead
of
a
habit,
and
in
doing
so,
writing
for
class
became
less
of
an
assignment
and
more
of
a
venue
to
express
my
ideas.
I
now
took
possession
of
my
writing
because
it
was
consisted
of
my
ideas,
but
this
did
not
help
me
accept
criticism
on
my
writing,
especially
criticism
that
wasnOt
justified.
One
aspect
my
sophomore
English
class
that
I
respected
more
than
anything
was
that
every
writing
mistake
I
made
was
explained
and
justified.
In
my
senior
year
of
high
school
I
found
that
not
all
teachers
will
take
the
time
to
better
their
studentsO
writing
by
making
understandable,
valid
comments.
The
first
paper
I
received
back
in
my
senior
AP
English
class
was
graded
a
C,
a
grade
that
I
was
not
familiar
with
unless
I
had
written
off
topic.
Now
under
circumstances
where
the
grade
was
justified
with
comments
that
explained
why
I
had
received
the
grade
and
how
I
can
improve
in
the
future,
I
would
have
accepted
the
critique
and
learned
from
it.
I
like
to
think
that
I
am
an
accepting
student
that
always
strived
to
better
her
work,
and
so
I
usually
take
grades
and
learn
from
them.
However,
there
were
few
comments
on
this
paper
to
justify
my
grade
and
of
the
comments
that
were
written,
none
taught
me
anything
about
writing
or
how
I
could
better
my
work.
The
comments
asked
me
questions
like
NwhyO
or
NhowO
directed
towards
specific
sentences,
and
though
I
failed
to
describe
NwhyO
and
NhowO
in
some
parts
of
my
essays,
most
of
the
time
I
felt
my
sentences
were
self
explanatory.
My
idea
of
quality
writing
obviously
differed
from
my
teacher
at
the
time,
so
I
met
her
after
school
to
discuss
how
I
could
improve.
After
we
met,
I
felt
more
dissatisfied
than
when
I
received
graded
papers
from
her.
The
conference
consisted
of
my
explanations
for
what
I
had
written
and
her
repeating
the
same
comments
she
had
already
written,
none
of
which
were
made
clearer
to
me;
I
felt
like
the
conference
was
more
of
a
struggle
than
a
conversation.
For
the
rest
of
the
year
I
really
tried
hard
to
make
sure
my
writing
was
logical
for
any
audience
reading
my
paper,
but
I
was
still
met
with
low
BOs
and
COs.
From
this
experience
I
guess
I
learned
that
not
everyone
is
going
to
appreciate
my
writing
or
my
efforts
to
improve
writing,
and
so
I
needed
to
take
the
good
advice
that
was
given
to
me
and
move
on.
I
knew
that
my
first
year
at
Lafayette
College
was
going
to
require
me
to
write
even
more
than
I
had
written
in
high
school.
I
didnOt
necessarily
think
my
writing
style
improved,
but
I
received
higher
grades
and
more
praise
on
my
writing
freshman
year
than
in
high
school.
One
aspect
of
writing
that
I
began
to
recognize
was
that
writing
took
on
many
different
structures
depending
on
what
class
I
was
writing
for.
For
example,
in
my
psychology
lab,
writing
was
focused
on
facts,
results,
and
explanations
of
my
experimental
results.
In
addition
to
receiving
good
grades
on
all
my
lab
reports,
I
also
found
that
writing
lab
reports
was
always
the
easiest
for
me
because
I
rarely
had
to
make
any
conclusions
on
my
own.
I
felt
most
confident
when
I
could
rely
on
results
for
a
paper,
but
I
found
psychology
lab
reports
and
any
other
scientific
writing
to
be
the
least
rewarding
for
me.
It
was
in
such
courses
as
my
college
writing
class
second
semester
sophomore
year
and
my
Jewish
Response
to
the
Holocaust
class
where
I
could
use
facts
and
research
to
branch
off
and
support
my
own
ideas
that
I
felt
most
accomplished.
I
feel
like
writing
in
the
social
sciences
differs
from
that
of
the
natural
sciences
because
social
sciences
encourage
students
to
reach
beyond
facts
and
develop
their
own
ideas.
In
doing
so,
I
think
that
I
have
developed
a
college
level
writing
format
that
is
challenging
because
it
forces
me
to
answer
questions
by
incorporating
my
own
concepts
and
yet
equally
rewarding
because
I
feel
more
attached
to
what
the
paper
is
saying.
As
much
freedom
I
have
to
write
in
the
social
sciences,
I
do
have
a
tendency
to
let
my
ideas
about
a
topic
take
me
away
from
the
topic
itself
and
I
end
up
tangentially
answering
the
prompt.
I
have
literally
written
a
fifteen
page
research
paper
in
the
wrong
format,
but
in
learning
my
writing
tendencies
the
hard
way,
I
now
diligently
check
the
assignmentOs
directions
and
re-read
my
papers
over
again
to
make
sure
that
I
answered
what
I
was
suppose
to
answer
and
it
is
clear
to
the
reader,
not
just
myself.
Since
recognizing
this
flaw,
I
have
taken
editing
very
seriously
and
I
continue
to
outline
my
ideas
before
writing
any
assignment,
whether
it
is
one
or
twenty
pages.
By
outlining
my
paper
before
writing
it,
I
can
continually
check
the
content
of
my
ideas
and
assure
that
my
ideas
are
on
topic
and
follow
a
logical
format.
Of
course
my
writing
today
is
still
not
perfect
and
I
donOt
ever
expect
it
to
be
perfect,
but
I
do
believe
I
improve
with
every
piece
of
writing
whether
it
is
in
my
journal
or
for
a
paper.
IOm
constantly
growing
as
a
writer,
and
I
really
appreciate
every
step
along
the
way.
