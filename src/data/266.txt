The
Writer,
Reader
and
the
Writing
Associate
Three
activities
contribute
to
my
role
as
a
Writing
Associate
(WA).
My
own
writing
has
an
obvious
effect
on
my
role
as
a
WA.
I
try
to
investigate
my
writing
habits
and
flesh
out
strategies
that
work
for
me
and
could
work
for
others
as
well.
My
job
as
a
WA
is
a
continuous
learning
process
and
therefore
has
an
impact
on
itself.
Last
but
not
the
least,
my
reading
habits
define
my
writing
and
reading
skills
and
therefore
play
a
significant
role
in
my
work
as
a
WA.
I
shall
discuss
each
of
these
activities
separately
in
the
context
of
their
effect
on
me
as
a
WA
over
the
past
year.
I
took
one
writing
class
last
year.
The
class
was
the
Economics
of
Latin
America
with
Professor
Mary
Beckman
in
the
Economics
and
Business
Department.
The
class
focuses
on
research
papers.
I
find
this
genre
of
writing
to
be
extremely
interesting
and
challenging
because
it
is
the
most
basic
form
of
formal
writing-
communication
of
facts
and
views
in
a
style
that
is
informative,
concise
and
readable.
The
challenge
in
doing
this
lies
in
the
organization
and
analysis
of
the
facts.
I
picked
up
-
or
rather,
I
was
given
-
one
valuable
tip
during
the
various
drafts
of
the
first
paper
I
wrote
for
this
class.
I
had
collected
a
great
deal
of
information
for
the
paper.
I
had
used
a
variety
of
sources.
I
had
some
compiled
sort
of
analysis.
Like
is
often
the
case,
my
first
draft
was
kind
of
messy
and
unfocussed
-
in
the
eyes
of
the
Professor.
I
could
not
see
the
mess,
as
all
the
facts
were
crystal
clear
in
my
own
mind.
I
had
fallen
into
the
usual
writer's
trap.
The
story
was
so
clear
in
my
mind
that
I
could
not
see
the
crisscross
intersections
sprawling
through
the
ten
pages
of
size
ten
script.
Professor
Beckman
gave
me
a
handy
tip
that
all
writers,
including
myself,
use,
consciously
or
otherwise,
all
the
time.
She
told
me
to
start
every
paragraph
with
a
clear
idea
and
develop
that
idea
in
that
paragraph.
This
sounds
very
intuitive,
but
I
have
found
both
as
a
writer
and
as
a
WA,
it
is
a
tip
that
many
people
forget
to
use.
I
examined
my
paper
and
sure
enough,
my
ideas
often
broke
away
half
way
through
a
paragraph
and
resurfaced
two
pages
later.
Although
the
'flow'
was
not
broken
and
nothing
seemed
out
of
place,
the
jumping
around
left
the
reader,
who
was
not
as
comfortable
with
facts
as
I
was,
a
little
confused.
I
do
not
use
rules
or
strict
guidelines
when
I
write.
I
write
intuitively
and
let
my
words
flow,
guided
by,
if
nothing
else,
my
mood
at
that
particular
time.
However,
I
decided
to
follow
this
simple
rule
strictly.
It
was
not
as
easy
as
it
might
sound.
Many
times
I
wanted
to
interject
a
new
thought
into
a
paragraph
just
for
effect
or
because
it
came
into
my
mind
at
that
point.
I
had
to
force
myself
to
finish
writing
all
I
had
to
write
to
finish
the
paragraph
that
I
had
begun.
I
found
the
process
tiresome.
The
work
seemed
to
lack
fluidity.
However,
the
paper
had
a
clarity
that
made
it
very
easy
for
the
reader
to
follow
what
I
was
writing
about.
Although
I
didn't
like
the
process
of
writing
as
much,
the
end
product
was
better
for
the
reader.
I
had
stumbled
upon
something
-
writing
for
somebody
else.
This
might
sound
silly
since
it
is
understood
that
what
is
written
is
meant
to
be
read
and
all
writers
must
keep
their
audience
in
mind.
However,
I
don't
think
I
ever
consciously
asked
myself,
'Will
so
and
so
understand
this?'
I
think
now,
that
I
wrote,
and
to
be
honest,
still
do
write
for
myself.
I
still
think
that
only
when
a
writer
writes
for
himself
or
herself
does
a
good
piece
of
writing
emerge
because
only
then
is
the
writer
honest
and
original.
I
guess
the
trick
is
to
write
for
ourselves
but
read
what
we
write
with
untouched
eyes.
The
past
year
marked
my
first
year
as
a
WA.
I
worked
with
the
English
as
a
Second
Language
program
(ESL).
In
this
program
we
work
with
foreign
students
or
with
students
whose
first
language
is
not
English.
The
year
was
all
about
grammar.
I
found
myself
studying
the
mechanics
of
writing,
the
nuances
that
I
use
naturally
because
English
is
the
language
I
am
most
fluent
in.
I
never
really
learnt
many
of
the
mechanics
of
sentence
structure
and
the
like
because
I
learnt
English
through
reading
and
conversations
and
the
natural
process
of
language
learning.
Therefore,
explaining
these
nuances
to
second
language
learners
was
a
challenge
that
was
frustrating
but
nevertheless
valuable.
I
learnt
as
I
attempted
to
help
others.
I
had
one
experience
as
a
WA
that
was
a
revelation
to
me
as
a
writer.
It
happened
when
I
was
working
with
a
foreign
student
whose
writing
background
is
very
similar
to
mine
since
we
went
through
the
same
education
system
in
high
school.
I
realized,
or
rather
discovered
an
aspect
of
my
writer's
psychology.
Our
conference
veered
toward
the
experiences
and
feelings
that
she
was
trying
to
write
about.
I
could
relate
to
the
experiences
she
spoke
about
and
we
discussed
similar
incidents
that
I
had
been
through.
Soon
I
saw
that
her
feelings
as
conveyed
through
our
conversation
were
a
lot
more
complex
and
interesting
than
what
she
had
managed
to
put
on
paper.
The
reason
was
obvious
to
me
because
it
is
a
situation
I
often
find
myself
falling
into,
often
completely
unconsciously.
When
writing
about
my
personal
experiences
especially
to
an
audience
that
is
not
familiar
to
the
events
or
people
I
am
talking
about,
I
tend
to
cloak
details
so
as
to
make
them
acceptable
to
the
reader.
I
do
not
think
I
am
writing
for
the
reader,
for
if
I
did,
I
would
be
contradicting
what
I
said
earlier
about
writing
for
myself.
It
is
more
like
the
complete
truth
takes
too
much
of
an
effort
to
express
and
the
alternative
of
slipping
into
banalities
is
so
easy.
In
doing
so
I
strip
my
work
of
the
honesty
that
it
can
have.
I
say
things
like
they
have
been
said
before
so
as
to
make
them
acceptable.
I
don't
take
risks
with
thoughts
feelings
or
expressions.
Saying
that
I
will
work
on
this
is
easier
said
than
done.
Over
the
year
I
have
learnt
to
be
more
open
to
different
kinds
of
writing.
I
realized
that
I
have
this
particular
definition
of
good
writing
in
my
mind,
derived
from
the
kinds
of
writing
that
I
typically
enjoy.
So
I
enter
a
conference
with
certain
expectations
and
not
see
all
that
there
is
to
see
in
the
paper.
I
think
I
need
to
work
on
entering
each
conference
with
an
open
mind
and
reading
each
paper
without
specific
expectations.
The
third
aspect
that
I
mentioned
earlier
was
the
reading
that
I
do.
This
summer
I
have
managed
to
make
up
for
the
void
during
the
semester.
I
have
discovered
a
love
for
stories
that
deal
with
people,
the
"human
experience",
personal
details,
authors
who
have
an
in
depth
knowledge
of
a
particular
place
and
are
able
to
bring
out
the
beauty
of
a
place
as
only
one
who
has
made
that
place
home
is
able
to.
As
always
I
believe
a
good
WA
should
be
a
voracious
reader.
I
think
my
summer
reading
experiences
will
definitely
help
me
in
my
assignment
as
a
WA.
