I
learned
to
read
when
I
was
four
years
old.
I
remember
going
across
the
street
to
read
to
our
neighbors,
although
now
I
wonder
why
a
grown
woman
would
want
to
listen
to
a
little
kid's
voice
struggle
with
the
words
stegosaurus
and
catastrophe.
I
read
books
about
dinosaurs
-
didn't
every
kid?
By
the
time
I
started
kindergarten
later
that
year,
I
had
become
pretty
comfortable
with
reading.
My
kindergarten
teacher
did
little
to
advance
these
skills;
in
fact
these
early
school
years
were
not
the
source
of
my
increasing
vocabulary
and
thirst
for
knowledge.
Maybe
it
was
because
of
her
poor
teaching
skills,
but
I
think
the
fact
that
I
had
few
people
to
"play
with"
after
school
prompted
me
to
start
learning
on
my
own.
I
mean,
I
used
to
play
board
games
against
myself
just
to
keep
myself
amused.
However,
the
source
of
my
fondest
memories
of
wasting
time
as
a
young
kid
is
still
sitting
on
a
shelf
in
my
room.
A
dictionary
we
had
in
the
house,
made
for
children,
kept
me
occupied
for
hours.
In
the
back
of
the
book,
there
are
lists
of
facts
(e.g.
coldest
day
on
record,
tallest
mountain
in
the
world,
etc.),
a
timeline
of
world
history,
and
a
pictured
list
of
all
of
our
country's
presidents.
Looking
back
to
that
time,
I
see
that
book
as
the
catalyst
of
all
my
future
craving
for
knowledge;
to
this
day
I
find
it
difficult
to
remain
"in
the
dark"
in
a
any
situation.
But
I
digress,
and
should
hurry
this
task
to
the
subject
at
hand.
I
remember
little
about
the
next
three
or
four
years
of
school,
save
for
some
reports
and
dioramas
made,
none
of
which
warrant
specific
mention.
I
continued
to
read
on
my
own
a
great
deal,
from
books
about
little
league
baseball
to
simply
reading
the
encyclopedias
we
had
in
the
house.
If
I
am
not
mistaken,
my
first
real
"creative
writing"
assignment
came
in
the
fourth
grade,
from
the
worst
teacher
I
have
ever
had
(I
will
say
no
more
of
her
-
I
would
only
get
upset).
While
the
specific
assignment
itself
escapes
me,
I
can
picture
quite
clearly
the
paper
upon
which
the
story
was
written.
We
were
given
many
sheets
of
small
yellow
paper,
about
5"
by
7",
(thank
you
New
York
school
system)
to
write
these
stories.
We
were
to
include
illustrations
in
the
body
of
the
story,
which
became
drawings
of
words
that
happen
to
appear
in
the
text.
If
I
mentioned
a
ring,
a
picture
of
a
ring
would
follow
the
word.
Having
entered
my
phase
of
reading
those
"choose
your
adventure"
books,
I
wrote
about
an
elf.
To
the
unfamiliar
reader,
these
books
have
many
points
in
the
story
where
one
is
forced,
for
instance,
to
choose
one
of
three
doorways
to
enter.
Each
doorway
advances
one
to
a
different
page
number
and
thus
a
new
part
of
the
story.
If
the
wrong
choice
is
made,
the
story
ends
in
defeat.
Conversely,
the
right
choice
leads
one
of
the
very
end
of
the
book
and
victory.
As
one
might
have
guessed,
I
refused
losses.
If
I
chose
the
wrong
door,
I
went
back
and
chose
again
until
I
won.
Who
would
ever
know?
In
any
case,
I
wrote
this
story
about
an
elf
who
goes
on
a
dangerous
mission
to
save
some
people
from
some
evil
person
(apologies
for
such
a
vague
plot,
but
I
do
not
remember
the
specifics).
What
I
do
remember,
which
is
perhaps
the
most
important
thing
anyway,
is
that
I
was
very
unhappy
with
it.
I
remember
realizing
that
I
was
not
comfortable
with
the
subject
matter
I
had
chosen;
elves
were
simply
not
my
thing.
Now
that
I
reflect
back
on
it,
was
that
the
first
time
I
ceased
to
care
about
a
school
assignment?
An
interesting
thought,
since
future
classes
and
teachers
would
kindle
this
feelings
within
me
many
more
times
before
I
was
out
of
high
school.
In
the
summer
before
fifth
grade,
my
family
and
I
moved
from
Queens,
NY
to
Brookfield,
CT.
There
I
became
involved
in
something
called
"talent
pool,"
which
gave
birth
to
my
intellectually
critical
side.
The
"brightest
and
most
creative"
students
in
each
grade
made
up
this
"talent
pool,"
which
I
feel
is
quite
a
confidence
destroyer
to
those
kids
not
chosen
to
be
in
this
group.
We
received
somewhat
special
treatment
from
other
kids,
in
that
we
were
involved
in
different
classes
and
often
allowed
to
show
up
late
for
class
because
talent
pool
had
run
a
little
late.
We
read
plays
aloud,
from
Inherit
the
Wind
to
RUR
to
Twelve
Angry
Men.
I
cannot
help
but
think
it
was
a
little
heavy
for
a
bunch
of
fifth
graders.
The
two
women
that
were
in
charge
of
talent
pool
were
really
great
women.
One
of
them,
Karen
Hanlon,
wrote
satirical
plays
that
became
the
school
productions.
Thus
began
my
career
in
theatre
as
well,
once
again
save
for
a
few
plays
back
in
old
New
York.
I
find
myself
with
little
to
say
about
the
other
woman,
Pam
Rogalin,
except
that
she
had
very
strange
taste
when
it
came
to
clothes
and
jewelry.
We
would
be
around
these
women
for
years
to
come,
for
they
continued
talent
pool
in
middle
school.
Although
I
wrote
many
book
reports
and
research
papers
in
these
years,
I
once
again
find
myself
with
very
few
interesting
things
to
say
about
them.
Perhaps
the
most
interesting
point
in
the
story
before
eighth
grade
is
that
of
sixth
grade
language
arts,
where
one
learns
the
rules
of
grammar.
These
rules,
not
meant
to
be
reiterated
from
that
point
forward,
were
nevertheless
expected
to
be
known
forwards
and
backwards,
if
I
am
allowed
at
least
one
cliche.
Unfortunately,
we
"talent
pool-ers"
were
deprived
of
learning
these
skills,
for
we
did
not
take
the
La.
course
like
the
rest
of
our
classmates.
Thus
we
never
learned
the
rules
of
grammar,
and
we
would
suffer
for
it
further
on
down
the
line.
Eighth
grade
brought
about
something
called
"eighth
grade
humanities,"
one
again
taught
by
Hanlon
and
Rogalin.
My
friends
and
I,
to
this
day,
refer
to
it
as
the
worst
class
we
have
ever
had
to
take.
Picture
this:
on
the
first
day,
we
were
distributed
copies
of
the
play
A
Man
For
All
Seasons.
Forgive
me,
for
I
forget
who
wrote
it;
I
am
terrible
with
names.
We
would
study
that
play,
every
word,
every
metaphor,
every
character
flaw,
for
the
nine
months
-180
days
-
of
eighth
grade.
We
received
assignments
far
beyond
the
grasp
of
an
eighth
grade
mind,
we
dealt
with
literary
questions
that
we
would
not
be
prepared
for
at
least
another
three
years.
In
short,
it
was
Hell.
I
wrote
a
paper
on
Copernicus
for
that
class,
even
though
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
play.
It
was
awful.
We
were
so
lost
as
to
what
was
expected
of
us
that
every
day
was
miserable.
Every
one
of
us
hated
it,
and
we
still
have
not
forgiven
them
for
it,
even
though
those
two
women
gave
us
so
much.
On
the
second
day
of
my
freshman
year
in
high
school,
I
learned
not
to
do
things
like
use
more
than
one
exclamation
point
and
underline
words
more
than
once.
I
suppose
that
is
when
and
where
my
writing
moved
into
"adult
phase,"
although
it
pains
me
to
still
see
college
students
doing
such
things.
Sometimes
my
arrogance
gets
in
the
way
of
my
brain's
functions.
Reading
books
like
Lord
of
the
Flies
and
Brave
New
World
furthered
my
understanding
of
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
(like
the
inconceivable
happy
ending
in
"Flies")
in
writing.
Oh
yes,
we
also
write
plays
as
groups
in
that
class.
Not
wanting
to
do
the
expected
fourteen
year-old
humor
play,
I
suggested
to
my
group
that
we
write
something
a
little
more
serious.
We
ended
up
with
a
"Jekyll
and
Hyde-esque"
play
that
was
so
bad
I
was
embarrassed
to
be
a
part
of
it.
My
unsatisfaction
with
my
writing
mounted.
Freshmen
year
was
also
the
start
of
Humanities
(now
with
a
capital
"H"),
which
I
suppose
can
be
called
the
talent
pool
of
high
school.
About
twenty
five
of
the
(once
again)
most
talented
students
were
chosen
to
be
a
part
of
the
Humanities
program.
Freshmen
year
it
was
an
after
school
program
taught
by
Mary
Lohmann,
who
just
might
be
the
smartest
person
I
have
ever
met.
We
read
books
like
Fahrenheit
451
and
talked
about
the
future
of
society.
The
following
year
gave
birth
to
another
relationship
essential
to
me
as
a
writer.
English
class
with
Carole
Smith
was
a
class
of
opposites.
We
had
painful
tasks
like
reading
horrid
Steinbeck
short
stories
(I
am
not
a
Steinbeck
fan),
but
we
also
learned
about
transcendentalism,
read
some
Vonnegut
works,
and
learned
how
to
write.
In
short,
for
once
in
our
lives,
we
had
a
teacher
who
treated
us
as
equals,
and
everyone
responded
as
a
result.
Another
low
point:
she
discovered
that
none
of
us
had
ever
received
proper
grammatical
instruction
(being
that
this
group
of
kids
was
the
same
as
the
talent
pool
of
sixth
grade),
so
assigned
us
hours
of
work
each
night
for
a
couple
of
months
to
get
us
caught
up.
That
was
awful;
I
have
quite
a
vice
against
grammar
and
care
not
for
conforming
to
its
guidelines
.
However,
I
find
myself
to
know
its
rules
very
well,
so
I
suppose
she
did
her
job
well.
While
receiving
specific
assignments
like
writing
declarative
essays
and
explanatory
essays
in
Smith's
english,
the
work
of
Humanities
10
was
exactly
the
opposite.
Lohmann's
class
was
a
circle
of
chairs
and/or
pillows
involved
in
a
daily
discussion.
It
was
considered
a
history
class,
but
what
was
gained
from
it
was
so
much
more.
Our
grades
came
from
either
book
critiques,
creative
projects,
two
independent
research
projects,
or
tests.
Tests
were
very
few
and
only
as
a
result
of
the
cirrocumuli
mandating
them.
The
book
critiques
were
in-depth
papers
about
any
book
we
chose
to
study.
Creative
projects
were
literally
anything
we
cared
to
do:
an
attempt
to
explain
their
purpose
would
be
impossible.
Perhaps
some
examples
would
be
more
fitting,
which
include
anything
from
a
paper
mache
Campbell's
soup
can
to
an
original
song
about
humanity's
relationship
with
animals,
from
storytelling
to
a
story
about
a
man
who
can
use
one
hundred
percent
of
his
brain
capacity.
Trying
to
explain
this
class
(that
is,
classes,
since
we
had
Humanities
11
as
well)
frustrates
me
greatly;
it
was
so
much
more
than
I
can
write
in
these
short
paragraphs.
Let
me
say
this.
Humanities
ceased
my
not
caring
about
grades
and
schoolwork
as
quickly
as
it
began.
It
caused
me
to
lose
my
innocent
view
of
the
world;
it
allowed
me
to
blossom
into
the
student
I
could
be.
I
spent
weeks
writing
papers
on
JFK
and
Nietzsche;
I
spent
hours
whipping
up
ones
on
Mao
and
WWII.
I
poured
my
heart
into
a
critique
of
Hesse's
Demian;
I
poured
empty
words
into
a
critique
of
Quinn's
Ishmael.
When
I
came
out
from
it,
both
Lohmann
and
her
successor,
Eugene
Newell,
called
me
a
"scholar."
Forgive
this
brief
vanity,
but
my
shining
moment
in
writing
must
be
addressed.
There
is
so
much
that
I
am
leaving
out,
yet
I
do
not
feel
it
important
to
go
back
and
fill
in
the
cracks.
Is
this
just
because
I
was
there
and
know
the
whole
story
by
heart?
Have
I
disallowed
the
reader
a
clear
picture
of
my
history
as
a
writer?
I
think
not.
Had
I
gone
through
every
paper
written
in
those
two
years
of
Humanities,
I
would
know
be
on
page
87
and
the
reader
would
be
in
fridge
looking
for
a
sandwich.
The
following
year,
senior
year,
Humanities
was
an
independent
study
course.
I
chose
to
spend
the
year
studying
ancient
religions
of
the
world,
and
by
June
I
had
created
"Vita,"
which
was
my
vision
of
what
the
perfect
religion
would
be.
Senior
year
was
a
great
time
for
me.
I
opted
to
take
Honors
English,
rather
than
AP,
in
order
to
have
Carole
Smith
once
again
for
a
teacher.
I
am
content
with
my
decision;
that
class
was
amazing.
Four
creative
writing
assignments
allowed
me
my
first
real
opportunity
to
write
stories,
which
is
what
I
care
to
do
more
than
anything
else
in
the
literary
genre.
Looking
at
those
papers
now,
I
see
my
development
as
a
writer
inside
an
amazing
year
-from
my
first
somewhat
failed
attempts
in
September
to
my
final
work,
a
play,
which
solidified
my
faith
in
my
own
writing.
I
suppose
it
would
not
be
fair
if
I
did
not
add
that
I
am
now
quite
displeased
with
the
play.
I
suppose
that
is
unavoidable.
Group
work
ruled
that
class,
and
many
papers
were
to
be
written
as
four-somes
about
whatever
work
we
happened
to
be
studying.
From
Shakespeare
to
Streetcar,
from
Native
Son
to
Gatsby,
I
wrote
a
lot
of
papers.
I
asked
my
group
to
please
just
let
me
do
all
the
writing;
I
felt
much
more
comfortable
doing
it
all
myself.
This
is
my
downfall
-
my
stubbornness
causes
me
to
want
to
do
everything
myself.
It
isn't
that
I
don't
(forgive
the
contractions)
value
others'
opinions,
but
I
simply
want
to
let
my
mind
roll
out
onto
the
page.
I
received
the
english
award,
ended
with
an
a
plus
average,
and
passed
the
AP
test
without
any
training.
Like
Tim
Duncan,
I
had
stayed
my
four
years,
and
now
I
was
ready
for
the
next
step.
I
can
find
little
to
say
about
writing
in
college
except
that
I
used
what
Lohmann,
Newell,
and
Smith
had
taught
me
and
simply
applied
it
to
the
greater
challenges
that
awaited
me.
I
was
forced
to
conform
these
ideas
to
fif
the
new
programs
of
college,
but
overall
nothing
changed.
More
than
anything,
it
is
my
independent
studies
that
still
control
my
writing.
When
Kurt
Vonnegut's
books
were
tops
on
my
list,
I
attempted
to
write
witty
yet
thoughtful
pieces.
When
Hermann
Hesse's
dreamy
ballads
ruled,
my
characters
searched
for
their
places
and
usually
ended
up
where
they
started,
yet
in
a
higher
level
of
thinking.
Now,
Jack
Keruoac
has
asserted
himself
as
king
of
my
literary
mind.
His
spontaneous
prose
kicks
grammatical
rules
to
the
wayside,
and
I
have
never
been
so
moved
by
writing
in
all
my
life.
I
hope
to
reach
this
level
of
writing
achieved
by
so
few
at
some
point
in
my
life,
but
for
now
I'll
stick
with
being
a
WA.
