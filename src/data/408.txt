Writing
As
a
WA
Workshop
Project
18
Aug
03
My
history
as
a
writer
over
the
last
year
is
a
somewhat
long,
lackluster
story,
which
I
thoroughly
dreaded
translating
into
essay
form.
Thinking
back,
I
recognize
some
significant
improvements
my
writing
has
made
over
the
last
year,
but
effectively
expressing
these
literary
maturations
in
a
way
that
new
WAs
could
understand
and
find
valuable
is
quite
a
daunting
task.
Last
yearOs
assignment,
a
detailed
analysis
of
my
progression
as
a
writer
throughout
my
career,
overtly
seemed
more
straightforward
because
I
had
a
larger
collection
of
experiences
and
written
works
to
use.
I
simply
focused
on
a
few
works
that
stood
out
in
my
mind
and
used
them
to
make
accurate
generalizations
about
my
strengths
and
weaknesses
as
a
writer.
This
was
not
too
difficult
a
task;
the
freedom
that
the
assignment
offered
to
explore
almost
any
facet
of
my
script
over
a
lifetime
of
writing
fell
perfectly
into
the
style
to
which
I
had
become
all
too
accustomed.
While
I
felt
that
my
organization
and
grammar
were
among
my
strong
points
as
a
writer,
my
style
was
in
some
ways
stagnant,
almost
Ncookie-cutter.O
My
ability
to
adapt
to
the
assignment
itself
was
sometimes
lacking,
and
as
a
result
my
analysis
and
content
were
at
times
incomplete.
Essentially,
this
new
assignment
asked
me
to
make
more
detailed
and
inclusive
remarks
than
I
had
made
in
the
previous
assignment
and
to
do
so
with
fewer
Nresources.O
While
contemplating
my
approach
to
this
assignment,
I
arrived
at
the
following
realization:
the
effects
of
my
work
as
a
WA
over
the
last
year
may
be
most
evident
in
the
fashion
that
I
approach
this
very
project.
There
is
not
one
specific
instance
I
can
recall
when
a
conference
drove
me
to
drastically
alter
my
own
style
of
writing.
Nevertheless,
my
work
as
a
WA
has
undoubtedly
helped
to
improve
my
writing,
not
through
a
single
revelation,
but
through
a
series
of
seemingly
insignificant
progressions.
IOve
always
been
told
that
writing
and
the
writing
process
are
not
something
you
can
master
and
then
use
indefinitely;
rather,
writing
is
art
and
the
artist
is
you
(trust
me,
IOve
heard
it
thousands
of
times).
Over
the
last
year,
I
feel
like
IOve
actually
begun
to
understand
what
that
statement
means.
The
class
of
students
I
met
with
from
my
assigned
FYS
had
unique
approaches
to
the
assignments
in
class
that
I
could
usually
categorize
into
one
of
three
groups.
A
few
of
the
students
commonly
attacked
each
assignment
with
a
ferocious
barrage
of
intellectual
buzzwords
and
overly
complicated
sentence
structures.
I
like
to
refer
to
this
style
as
the
NDickens-Einstein
approach,O
because
these
writers
use
the
most
complex
words
they
can
uncover,
but
do
so
like
they
were
being
paid
by
the
word
(as
Charles
Dickens
was).
The
result
is
usually
a
paper
that
is
not
only
uninspiring,
but
also
lacks
in
content
because
of
the
authorOs
wordiness
and
inability
to
be
concise.
Generally,
these
types
of
papers
were
difficult
to
read,
but
their
complexity
could
be
attributed
to
their
lack
of
focus
and
dependence
on
their
vocabulary
rather
than
a
mastery
of
the
subject
matter.
Other
students
still
took
the
less
common
and
probably
least
effective
approach
where,
in
the
face
of
an
assignment
that
was
challenging
or
unfamiliar
to
the
writer,
they
tried
to
distance
themselves
from
the
assignment
by
intentionally
sabotaging
it
(a
style
I
coined
Nthe
French
approachO).
While
I
cannot
recall
ever
taking
this
approach
myself,
reading
these
types
of
papers
and
discussing
them
with
the
students
was
valuable
to
both
parties.
Most
often,
the
students
and
I
realized
that
their
background
knowledge
of
the
subject
was
in
no
way
inferior
to
other
studentsO
knowledge;
only
a
more
concerted
effort
was
needed
to
improve
their
papers.
The
students
with
the
most
effective
papers
(not
only
in
my
opinion
but
also
in
the
opinion
of
the
professor),
were
those
who
took
the
following
approach
to
the
assignments
consistently:
*
Devotion
of
time
to
the
assignment
*
Clear
focus
in
the
paper
*
Understanding
the
goals/expectations
of
the
assignment/professor
*
Recognizing
the
limitations
of
your
own
writing
Why
do
I
stress
consistently?
If
writing
is
a
creative
process
that
is
always
developing,
one
must
consistently
write
to
improve
his
performance.
It
is
just
like
any
other
talent
like
athletics
or
music,
no
matter
how
much
you
feel
you
may
have
mastered
the
art
of
writing,
you
will
inevitably
read
something
another
writer
has
produced
which
is
in
some
way
superior
to
your
work.
By
superior
I
mean
that
the
writer
has
expressed
an
idea
in
a
unique
fashion
that
is
both
interesting
and
informative.
The
English
language
allows
for
an
almost
infinite
array
of
word
combinations
to
express
the
same
or
similar
thought.
Understanding
the
different
ways
to
express
a
thought
is
just
like
being
an
artist
and
having
more
colors
on
your
palette
from
which
to
choose.
I
know
that
some
of
the
least
successful
writers
in
the
FYS
class
had
some
of
the
greatest
impact
on
my
writing.
Merely
reading
the
essays
for
the
conferences
introduced
me
to
a
variety
of
approaches
one
may
take
in
completing
an
assignment.
While
no
specific
examples
come
to
mind,
I
can
remember
reading
essays
and
thinking
that
the
student
had
done
an
excellent
job
in
relaying
to
the
reader
his
thoughts.
As
I
wrote
my
own
essays,
I
began
to
recognize
that
my
writing
strategy
was
unintentionally
beginning
to
borrow
from
the
strategies
that
were
surfacing
in
the
student
conferences.
Similarly,
I
began
to
recognize
when
students
were
unsuccessful
in
relating
their
ideas
to
the
readers,
and
I
started
to
see
some
similarities
between
these
ineffective
approaches
and
approaches
I
was
taking
myself.
As
a
result,
my
writing
style
adjusted
to
adopt
the
effective
methods
I
observed
while
moving
away
from
my
habitual
shortcomings.
While
the
most
important
alterations
in
my
writing
are
due
primarily
to
my
exposure
to
different
writing
styles
and
techniques,
the
WA
programOs
most
concrete
influence
on
my
writing
concerns
my
approach
to
an
assignment.
As
previously
mentioned,
I
generally
took
a
similar
method
when
confronting
an
assignment.
I
feel
now
that
I
am
much
more
flexible
in
my
approach
to
writing,
which
is
possibly
most
evident
when
comparing
this
yearOs
and
last
yearOs
literacy
narratives.
Last
year
my
preoccupation
with
improving
my
organization
detracted
from
my
ability
to
critically
analyze
effectively,
but,
most
importantly,
my
papers
were
neither
fresh
nor
unique.
As
my
first
year
as
a
WA
unfolded,
I
started
to
appreciate
my
work
more.
In
fact,
some
of
the
works
of
which
I
am
most
proud
were
written
near
last
semesterOs
culmination.
It
was
the
increased
appreciation
for
my
own
work
that
made
the
personal
positive
effects
of
my
work
as
a
WA
even
more
evident.
Moving
away
from
my
own
writing
for
a
moment,
I
would
like
to
address
some
methods
I
have
employed
in
conferences
and
the
results
I
have
discovered.
From
conversations
I
have
had
with
fellow
WAs,
IOve
learned
that
one
of
the
major
issues
that
new
WAs
face
is
establishing
authority
with
the
writer.
Authority
is
based
on
trusting
your
own
knowledge
of
writing,
yet
it
can
be
difficult
to
maintain,
especially
if
the
new
WA
is
a
naturally
shy
person.
The
way
to
gain
authority
while
remaining
on
friendly,
Npeer-likeO
terms
with
the
student
is
to
be
confident
in
yourself.
Easier
said
than
done,
right?
The
following
is
a
tip
even
the
most
timid
WA
can
use
to
establish
authority.
Imagine
for
a
moment
that
a
student
comes
in
to
conference
with
you.
The
student
is
obviously
less
than
enthusiastic
to
be
meeting
with
you,
the
WA,
despite
some
glaring
errors
in
his
essay.
Specifically,
there
are
some
serious
paragraphing
issues;
none
of
the
paragraphs
are
focused,
and
the
writerOs
transitioning
is
therefore
ineffective
because
there
really
is
no
organization
to
warrant
using
a
transition.
I
offer
up
WA
approach
A:
Approach
A:
NWell,
Carl,
your
paper
has
some
points
of
interest
that
appear
to
tackle
the
topics
the
professor
wants
addressed.
Unfortunately,
your
paper
seems
to
lack
focus
and
you
have
some
issues
with
paragraphing.
LetOs
take
at
the
main
points
your
paper
is
trying
to
make,
and
maybe
we
can
organize
the
paragraphs
in
a
more
cohesive
fashion.O
This
is
valuable
advice;
it
encourages
the
student
by
mentioning
something
he
has
done
well
in
his
paper,
which
precedes
the
main
issue
he
should
consider.
Furthermore,
offering
to
help
the
student
with
his
paragraphing
encourages
him
to
address
a
problem
that
he
could
be
unable
to
solve
himself
and
one
that
could
be
a
recurring
issue.
Despite
the
positives
approach
A
has
to
offer,
it
still
could
be
improved
upon.
The
student
will
likely
overlook
this
WAOs
sound
advice
because
the
student
may
have
a
negative
preconception
regarding
the
WA
program
(of
course,
this
is
never
warranted)
or
because
he
may
be
overconfident
in
his
writing
skills
and
therefore
indifferent
to
whatever
advice
you
may
offer.
Look
how
approach
B
forces
the
student
to
at
least
seriously
consider
if
not
accept
what
the
WA
is
offering:
Approach
B:
NSo,
Carl,
your
paper
seems
to
cover
most
of
what
the
professor
wanted.
I
liked
how
you
mentioned
your
own
personal
opinion
here,
and
it
relates
well
to
the
topic
as
a
whole.
I
was
speaking
with
the
professor
recently
about
this
paper,
and
he
mentioned
that
a
key
to
a
successful
paper
was
organization.
As
you
can
see
here,
paragraph
is
unfocused.
Maybe
you
could
combine
these
two
paragraphs
because
they
relate
well
to
one
another.O
Once
again,
the
WA
has
done
well
by
mentioning
some
of
the
paperOs
strong
points.
By
telling
the
student
specifically
what
the
professor
wants
in
the
paper,
the
studentOs
interest
is
drawn
into
the
meeting
because
his
paperOs
deficiencies
not
only
seem
unacceptable
in
your,
the
WAOs,
opinion,
but
they
will
also
be
scrutinized
and
likely
penalized
by
the
professor.
In
effect,
identifying
your
opinion
with
the
opinion
of
the
professor
will
be
beneficial
in
future
conferences
with
that
student
because
he
can
see
the
direct
results
of
your
guidance
through
his
grades.
Obviously,
regular
conversations
with
the
professor
will
help
a
WA
give
useful
advice
and
subsequently
gain
authority.
But
what
should
a
WA
do
if
a
studentOs
most
evident
writing
issue
involves
something
the
WA
has
not
discussed
with
the
professor?
Lie!
You
as
the
WA
should
be
confident
in
the
advice
you
offer
a
student,
and
a
little
fib
will
only
encourage
the
student
to
listen
to
your
excellent
suggestions.
Overall,
I
can
see
the
direct
results
my
work
as
a
WA
over
the
last
year
has
had
on
my
own
writing.
Ironically,
conferences
can
be
just
as
helpful
to
the
WA
as
they
are
helpful
to
the
student.
The
key
to
improving
in
anything,
particularly
writing,
is
recognizing
that
there
is
always
room
to
improve.
This
improvement
can
be
accelerated
simply
by
opening
oneself
to
the
infinite
number
of
options
one
has
when
expressing
an
idea.
This
palette
of
rotating,
creative
decisions
is
what
makes
quality
writing
both
interesting
and
attractive
to
the
reader.
While
uniformity
is
encouraged
in
some
fields
(such
or
chemistry
and
engineering
where
precision
is
required
to
curb
any
potential
confusion),
creative
freedom
is
what
distinguishes
writing
from
these
fields.
A
writer
can
familiarize
himself
with
these
nearly
limitless
writing
options
by
reading
work
done
by
various
writers
of
various
skill
levels.
Of
course,
all
of
my
colleagues
should
have
ample
opportunities
to
read
a
collage
of
unique
styles
over
the
yearOs
progression.
