Project
for
Workshop
Writing
as
a
WA
Fall
2004
Returning
Writing
Associate
As
my
senior
year
approaches,
I
have
come
to
the
realization
that
I
am
not
a
great
writer.
I
still
am
not
sure
how
to
best
attack
a
new
writing
assignment
and
I
cannot
claim
an
innovative
or
necessarily
successful
writing
technique
as
my
own.
I
am
not
very
eloquent
and
I
struggle
to
come
across
as
witty
or
humorous.
Despite
my
vast
room
for
improvement,
I
know
I
have
grown
as
a
writer
over
the
last
three
years.
As
I
have
matured
academically,
I
have
accepted
what
I
do
know
and
where
my
potential
lies.
I
know
how
to
write
a
decent
paper
that
communicates
coherent
ideas
and
I
am
confident
in
my
ability
to
converse
about
writing
and
to
help
others
with
their
writing
processes.
I
think
I
am
a
more
talented
Writing
Associate
than
I
am
a
writer.
My
confidence
in
my
ability
as
a
WA
stems
from
the
differences
between
being
a
WA
and
being
a
writer.
My
own
confidence
as
a
WA
is
fueled
greatly
by
the
students
who
have
faith
in
my
ability
to
help
them.
Students
depend
on
their
WAs
to
assist
them,
and
this
trust
is
reassuring.
However,
as
a
writer,
I
do
not
have
peers
looking
up
to
me
and
reassuring
me
when
I
am
working
on
my
own
papers;
instead,
it
is
up
to
me
to
provide
myself
with
that
confidence.
This,
perhaps,
I
will
find
with
time
and
more
practice
as
a
writer.
One
does
not
need
to
be
a
great
writer
in
order
to
be
a
talented
listener.
And
one
must
not
be
an
acclaimed
writer
to
successfully
help
other
people
with
their
writing
as
an
informed
reader
engaged
in
conversation
during
the
writing
process.
Conversing
about
writing
is
in
itself
a
talent
which,
like
most
other
talents,
is
acquired
through
practice.
I
feel
confident
in
my
ability
as
an
informed
reader
and
I
know
my
skills
as
a
WA
have
improved
drastically
over
the
course
of
my
three
semesters
working
with
other
students.
This
past
winter
I
had
a
humbling
experience.
I
took
an
interim
trip
to
London
to
study
the
London
Theater.
One
of
the
first
assignments
was
to
write
a
review
of
one
of
the
shows
we
had
seen
with
the
class.
I
had
never
written
any
type
of
review
before,
but
I
was
not
too
concerned.
I
always
received
high
grades
on
my
papers
and
I
thought
I
would
be
at
an
advantage
as
an
English
major
writing
among
many
non-English
majors.
I
had
read
many
reviews
of
various
other
shows
to
inspire
me
and
to
help
me
to
grasp
the
style
of
review
writing.
I
found
many
of
the
professional
reviews
to
be
concise,
gripping,
and
informative,
and
intermingled
with
bits
of
witty
humor.
I
thought
my
own
review
resembled
this
technique
and
I
was
proud
of
what
I
considered
to
be
funny
one-liners
and
intelligent
vocabulary
that
would
impress
my
readers.
My
peer-editing
group
for
that
class
was
relieved
to
learn
that
I
was
a
WA.
I
have
found
that
students
who
are
not
Writing
Associates
have
high
expectations
for
their
fellow
students
who
are.
To
them,
the
title
is
accompanied
with
the
expectation
of
a
superior
writer.
My
group
was
pleased
that
someone
they
thought
was
a
talented
writer
would
be
reading
their
papers.
If
only
they
knew
I
received
a
C
on
that
paper,
they
may
have
lost
all
of
their
confidence
in
WAs
forever.
I
think
they
were
reluctant
to
give
me
suggestions
on
ways
to
improve
my
paper
because
they
automatically
assumed
that
I
was
a
flawless
writer.
I
certainly
do
not
blame
them
for
my
grade
on
that
paper.
It
was
my
fault
for
thinking
that
my
contrived
style
and
my
word
choice
and
poor
humor
would
give
me
an
additional
boost
after
setting
a
foundation
of
what
I
considered
an
already
good
paper.
Clearly
I
needed
to
reassess
what
a
NgoodO
paper
was.
That
grade
plagued
me
for
much
longer
than
it
should
have.
It
did
not
bother
me
so
much
that
it
was
a
scar
on
my
otherwise
fairly
praiseworthy
average
in
that
class.
I
was
more
upset
because
of
the
message
that
the
less
than
mediocre
grade:
something
was
missing
in
my
writing
but
I
did
not
know
what.
Working
as
a
WA
with
students
this
past
semester
has
helped
me
to
realize
why
I
received
a
C
on
that
theater
review,
and
more
importantly,
what
I
can
strive
to
do
to
improve
my
writing
in
the
long
run.
At
the
beginning
of
last
semester,
I
met
with
the
VaST
class
I
was
to
work
with
to
discuss
their
first
assigment.
They
were
told
to
write
about
the
cultural
and
social
influences
on
their
food
consumption.
To
me,
it
seemed
like
a
straightforward
assignment.
However,
I
was
surprised
to
find
the
students
struggling
with
the
assignment.
Instead
of
providing
insight
into
their
ethnic,
cultural,
and
traditional
backgrounds
as
was
expected
of
them,
I
found
that
few
actually
stuck
to
the
assignment.
Some
of
the
bolder
students
admitted
to
me
about
how
much
trouble
they
had
writing
about
themselves
and
their
own
experiences.
I
had
trouble
grasping
this
concept.
What
subject
could
one
choose
that
is
more
familiar
than
oneself?
Many
of
their
papers
began
looking
strangely
similar
to
my
first
theater
review.
When
I
face
an
new
type
of
assignment,
especially
with
a
genre
that
I
am
not
accustomed
to,
I
have
always
attempted
(extra
emphasis
on
the
word
attempt)
to
load
sophisticated
language
into
my
papers
and
crack
jokes
to
amuse
my
reader,
perhaps
as
a
way
of
masking
my
insecurity.
With
the
C
paper,
I
realized
that
this
alone
does
not
earn
a
paper
any
acclaim.
When
I
began
working
with
a
new
group
of
students
second
semester,
the
memory
of
the
mistakes
that
had
earned
my
C
still
fresh
in
my
mind,
I
started
recognizing
similar
problems
to
my
own
in
the
papers
I
was
reading.
Many
papers
were
full
of
very
conservative,
traditional
language
and
esoteric
vocabulary
reminiscent
of
that
found
in
the
depths
of
an
SAT
preparatory
book.
However,
the
assignment
did
not
call
for
such
formalities.
I
found
that
the
communication
of
key
ideas
can
be
tarnished,
and
sometimes
even
lost
among
flowery
additions
and
a
contrived
style.
I
realized
this
was
my
major
mistake
when
I
faced
a
writing
style
that
was
unfamiliar
to
me.
I
tried
to
hard
to
turn
the
paper
into
something
that
I
thought
my
readers
were
expecting
it
to
be
without
focusing
on
the
clarity
of
what
I
was
communicating.
This
past
semester
I
took
creative
writing
and
I
found
myself
relating
to
the
VaST
students
I
was
working
with
even
more.
As
a
child,
creative
writing
was
my
favorite
genre.
I
took
a
break
from
it
when
I
became
busy
with
other
schoolwork
when
I
entered
high
school,
but
I
always
intended
to
return
to
it.
It
was
no
accident
that
I
waited
until
my
third
year
of
college
to
take
this
class.
I
strategically
waited
until
I
had
a
couple
of
semester
of
college
writing
experience
under
my
belt
because
I
wanted
my
writing
to
be
more
fine-tuned
before
I
tried
my
hand
at
my
favorite
kind.
I
probably
should
have
taken
the
class
sooner
because
much
of
what
I
learned
helped
me
to
better
relate
to
the
students
I
was
working
with
as
a
WA.
Much
of
the
advice
my
professor
gave
me
was
advice
I
have
always
given
to
other
students
without
necessarily
following
it
myself
with
my
own
writing.
I
also
learned
to
relate
to
the
students
who
were
struggling
with
their
first
VaST
assignment;
writing
about
oneself
and
oneOs
own
nutty
quirks
can
be
a
little
uncomfortable,
at
least
at
first.
One
of
the
first
words
of
advice
from
my
creative
writing
professor
class
was
not
to
use
clichs.
We
were
not
supposed
to
write
poetry
in
the
traditional
form
that
many
of
us
were
accustomed
to
reading.
We
were
told
to
be
ourselves,
and
of
course,
to
be
creative.
Not
only
had
I
never
written
poetry
before,
but
I
had
also
never
been
at
such
a
loss
as
to
where
to
begin
the
assignment.
I
sat
at
my
computer,
dumbfounded.
I
took
a
walk.
I
sat
on
a
couch
and
free
wrote
on
paper.
I
came
up
with
essentially
nothing.
I
felt
very
vulnerable;
I
was
not
assigned
to
write
about
someone
elseOs
writing,
or
to
analyze
someone
elseOs
ideas.
This
time
I
was
to
open
a
window
into
my
own
mind.
One
of
the
most
frequent
pieces
of
advice
I
give
to
the
students
I
work
with
is
to
read
their
writing
aloud
to
themselves.
Sometimes
if
I
come
across
a
passage
that
sounds
awkward,
I
suggest
they
take
the
paper
home
and
read
it
to
themselves
because
it
is
usually
easier
to
hear
the
problem.
I
do
not
remember
where
I
came
up
with
this
idea;
perhaps
it
was
a
suggestion
from
another
WA.
But
it
seems
to
work
for
students
because
over
time
several
have
come
back
to
me
with
positive
results
after
trying
that
method.
I
sometimes
even
ask
a
student
to
read
a
passage
aloud
to
me
during
a
conference
and
he
or
she
is
able
to
indicate
where
the
lack
of
clarity
lies
and
can
make
a
correction
almost
immediately.
I
never
actually
took
this
advice
for
myself
until
I
was
in
creative
writing.
Each
time
the
class
met,
the
students
were
to
bring
in
work
to
read
out
loud
to
the
class.
At
first,
I
dreaded
the
point
in
the
class
when
everyone
stood
up
in
the
front
of
the
room
to
read
their
latest
work.
It
was
uncomfortable
for
me
both
as
a
reader
and
as
writer.
I
was
concerned
that
my
writing
was
not
as
good
as
the
students
who
were
already
accomplished
poets
with
expansive
portfolios
and
published
works.
I
was
not
shy
about
presenting
in
front
of
the
class
because
speaking
in
front
of
people
has
never
bothered
me.
It
was
my
own
work
I
feared.
What
if
my
ideas
were
boring?
Or
too
crazy?
I
felt
vulnerable
like
the
students
in
the
VaST
class
who
had
to
write
about
their
eating
habits.
I
was
worried
about
how
my
quirks
would
be
perceived
by
others.
All
I
wanted
to
do
was
produce
some
poetry
that
sounded
at
least
somewhat
as
good
as
my
fellow
students.
I
regretted
not
having
practiced
my
creative
writing
in
recent
years
and
wished
I
had
kept
it
up
as
the
other
students
in
the
class
had.
So
I
began
to
take
the
advice
that
as
a
WA
I
have
been
giving
my
fellow
students
for
years
and
read
my
work
aloud
while
I
was
in
the
process
of
writing
it.
I
practiced
my
writing
and
read
it
aloud
to
myself.
I
became
accustomed
to
hearing
my
voice
read
my
work
and
I
became
less
shy
about
letting
others
listen
to
my
voice.
I
proved
to
myself
that
listening
to
the
sound
of
writing
is
often
as
important
as
its
appearance
on
a
page
when
reading
it
over
quietly
to
oneself.
Fine-tuning
the
sound
of
writing
when
working
on
it
aloud
helps
to
improve
its
clarity
and
ability
to
communicate
when
read
later,
silently
as
a
final
draft.
My
experience
with
creative
writing
this
past
semester
taught
me
the
importance
of
finding
my
own
voice,
having
confidence
in
my
strength,
and
the
importance
of
taking
my
own
advice.
Striving
to
sound
like
someone
else
is
one
of
the
biggest
mistakes
a
writer
can
make.
As
soon
as
I
started
to
listen
to
my
own
voice
in
my
writing
(figuratively
and
literally)
my
writing
improved.
It
started
to
improve
as
my
poetry
became
more
unique.
It
took
my
greatest
bout
of
confidence
to
write
about
a
dream
I
had
in
which
a
Great
Dane
I
found
me
in
an
Irish
hotel.
It
may
sound
ridiculous,
but
I
felt
brave
when
I
presented
it
to
my
professor
and
she
praised
that
poem
as
my
best
work
of
the
semester.
It
was
the
only
poem
I
had
written
that
I
had
not
at
all
contrived
to
sound
impressive.
What
I
had
in
common
with
the
students
I
worked
with
in
the
VaST
class
was
our
eagerness
for
our
writing
to
be
impressive
in
the
way
that
we
thought
would
earn
us
prais.
We
were
willing
to
sacrifice
the
content
and
style
and
our
own,
unique
voices
in
order
to
create
a
writing
product
that
we
thought
constituted
the
type
of
impressive
work
produced
by
a
NgoodO
writer.
In
doing
so,
the
only
accomplishment
we
made
was
to
create
something
that
appeared
as
exactly
what
it
was,
a
contrived
piece
of
writing.
My
dream
is
to
become
a
published
writer.
I
have
learned
that
my
chances
of
achieving
this
goal
are
lessened
as
I
try
to
mimic
the
style
of
accomplished
writers.
I
know
now
that
to
be
great
is
not
to
acquire
and
master
a
single
style.
The
first
way
I
must
improve
my
writing
is
to
take
my
own
good
advice
and
to
keep
exploring
new
writing
genres.
I
also
need
to
learn
to
be
confident
in
myself.
So
here
is
a
piece
of
advice
I
will
give
to
new
WAs,
and
I
vow
to
adhere
to
myself
in
my
final
year
at
college:
have
confidence
in
your
intelligence,
in
your
ideas,
your
talent
as
a
WA
and
as
a
writer.
