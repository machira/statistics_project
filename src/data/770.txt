Returning
WA
Narrative
In
the
span
of
about
six
months
which
included
going
abroad
for
a
semester
to
Spain
and
a
summer
internship,
I
had
written
about
10
pages
of
academic
writing
in
total.
Needless
to
say,
when
the
fall
semester
of
my
junior
year
was
about
to
begin,
my
writing
was
a
tad
on
the
rough
side.
So
when
I
was
assigned
the
NReturning
WA
Narrative,O
I
was
very
nervous.
Was
it
possible
to
revoke
someoneOs
position
as
a
WA
due
to
an
awful
essay?
Do
professors
laugh
when
they
read
terrible
essays?
Questions
like
these
were
racing
through
my
head
as
I
pressed
the
submit
button
on
Moodle
to
Nhand
inO
my
essay.
I
was
able
to
push
the
assignment
to
the
back
of
my
head
until
WA
orientation.
When
I
flipped
through
the
packet
given
to
all
of
the
WAs
and
saw
the
familiar
example
essays,
I
felt
more
at
ease.
Maybe
the
essay
would
just
be
tucked
away
in
a
nice
little
corner
and
left
to
rot
there,
but
unfortunately
when
I
got
to
the
end
of
the
packet,
I
saw
I
had
received
someone
elseOs
essay,
which
meant
someone
out
there
had
my
essay.
Towards
the
end
of
the
orientation
we
eventually
paired
up
with
the
person
who
had
our
essay.
The
person
I
was
paired
with
was
a
new
WA.
This
actually
put
more
pressure
on
me
because
I
felt
as
though
I
needed
to
set
a
good
example,
but
then
when
I
began
to
look
over
her
paper,
something
clicked
and
I
just
fell
right
back
into
the
swing
of
things.
It
was
like
all
the
anxieties
I
had
about
my
writing
and
my
abilities
as
a
WA
just
dissipated.
I
didnOt
care
about
those
things.
I
just
read
the
paper,
put
my
comments
down,
and
thought
about
what
to
ask
the
student.
When
it
was
time
to
come
back
and
actually
do
the
mock
conference,
we
went
through
my
paper
first.
She
was
slightly
aggressive
in
telling
me
what
she
thought
I
should
do
and
never
really
asked
me
why
I
may
have
made
the
choices
I
did.
When
she
was
criticizing
my
paper,
my
first
thought
was,
Nwho
is
this
person
coming
along
and
just
ripping
my
paper
apart?O.
I
then
realized
that
I
was
in
the
position
most
WA
students
are
in
for
their
first
conference.
They
have
written
something
that
they
deem
appropriate
enough
to
hand
in
and
another
student
they
probably
donOt
know
comes
and
just
wants
to
change
this
and
that
about
their
works.
Being
on
the
receiving
end
of
this
treatment
during
the
orientation
made
me
realize
how
important
the
approach
is
to
a
conference.
If
you
go
in
there
with
a
list
of
things
you
want
to
change
about
a
paper
and
never
ask
the
student
about
the
choices
he
or
she
made,
very
little
is
going
to
sink
in.
The
WA
may
have
great
things
to
say,
but
if
not
done
in
an
appropriate
manner,
the
conference
will
be
lost
and
the
only
thing
the
student
will
have
gained
from
it
may
be
the
fact
that
he/she
doesnOt
really
feel
like
doing
another
WA
conference.
This
is
especially
important
when
dealing
with
freshmen
in
FYS.
Although
at
the
beginning
the
writing
may
be
particularly
rough
and
need
a
lot
of
work,
it
is
key
that
one
takes
into
account
the
mindset
of
the
student
the
WA
is
NWA-ingO.
First
year
students
are
fresh
out
of
high
school
and
each
high
school
may
have
handled
writing
differently.
However,
most
likely,
none
of
these
students
have
written
for
a
college
professor
or
in
a
college
environment
and
the
jump
between
what
is
expected
in
high
school
and
what
is
expected
in
college
is
vast.
There
has
to
be
a
certain
level
of
understanding
of
the
situation
of
these
students
by
the
WA.
The
way
to
deal
with,
say,
a
third
year
Lafayette
student
and
a
first
year
student
has
to
be
different.
The
third
year
student,
no
matter
what
major,
at
least
has
some
idea
of
what
is
expected
of
him
or
her.
However,
the
first
year
student
only
has
this
vague
and
abstract
notion
of
what
is
required
in
college.
This
topic
is
addressed
in
the
article
NInventing
the
UniversityO
by
David
Bartholomae.
Even
though
I
have
covered
this
particular
article
for
two
years
now,
I
still
think
it
is
one
of
the
key
pieces
we
discuss
as
WAs
because
it
really
puts
into
light
a
common
issue
in
academic
writing
in
a
college
environment.
I
have
had
both
my
best
and
worst
experiences
as
a
WA
with
first
year
students.
Two
semesters
ago,
I
was
the
WA
for
an
FYS
dealing
with
womenOs
health.
It
was
a
class
of
all
freshmen
girls.
Everyone
in
the
class,
even
at
the
first
meeting,
was
very
enthusiastic
for
the
class.
It
is
so
much
easier
to
work
with
people
when
they
are
writing
about
things
that
interest
them.
Working
with
students
that
actually
want
to
improve
their
writing
because
they
want
to
churn
out
quality
work
for
their
professor
and
themselves
is
a
real
joy.
It
energized
me
to
bring
a
little
extra
to
the
conferences.
I
got
to
play
off
of
their
enthusiasm.
When
they
would
ask
me
questions
about
the
direction
of
their
paper,
I
would
say
something
like
Nwell
what
about
something
like
this?O
and
then
that
would
start
a
back
and
forth
conversation
where
both
parties
are
working
to
produce
the
best
piece
possible.
When
conferences
go
well
like
that,
it
really
establishes
a
bond
between
the
students
and
the
WA.
The
students
learn
that
the
WA
and
the
college
writing
program
is
there
to
help
them
rather
than
to
be
a
spy
for
their
professor.
When
the
students
build
that
bond,
they
are
much
more
willing
to
discuss
their
papers
and
be
a
little
more
open
with
the
WA.
However,
not
all
of
the
classes
I
have
worked
with
have
been
as
enthusiastic
as
that
one.
Last
semester
I
worked
with
sophomores
for
an
engineering
VAST
class.
It
was
apparent
that
many
of
the
students
did
not
find
the
topic
of
NsustainabilityO
to
be
the
most
fascinating
of
subjects,
and
this
showed
in
their
eagerness
in
conferences
and
the
quality
of
their
writing.
All
of
the
assignments
seemed
to
be
purely
work
for
most
of
the
students.
There
was
little
to
no
enthusiasm
when
the
professor
would
give
them
the
assignment
which
meant
that
there
was
little
to
no
enthusiasm
when
they
had
to
talk
about
their
papers
in
our
conferences.
I
would
try
to
suggest
possible
ways
to
approach
issues
in
their
papers
and
they
would
shrug
it
off
with
the
all
too
familiar
Nyep,
ok.O
The
students
and
I
both
checked
the
clock
multiple
times
to
see
just
how
much
of
the
allocated
thirty
minutes
was
left.
Even
though
working
with
this
class
was
difficult
in
the
beginning,
I
knew
that
as
their
WA,
I
had
a
duty
to
try
and
help
them.
I
think
the
issue
here
was
that
the
students
hadnOt
bothered
to
explore
all
that
they
could
do
with
the
class.
When
it
came
time
to
write
the
major
paper
of
the
semester,
I
knew
that
if
the
students
were
not
excited
about
their
topics,
the
next
two
rounds
of
WA
conferences
would
be
the
most
excruciatingly
painful
conferences
ever.
The
professor
had
made
it
very
clear
to
me
that
he
wanted
the
students
to
pick
something
that
they
were
interested
in.
That
was
one
of
the
main
things
he
had
stressed
to
me
when
I
met
with
my
partner
professor.
So,
when
students
came
to
me
saying
they
were
Nsort
of
interested
in
solar
panelsO
and
that
Nwind
energy
was
ok,O
it
was
my
job
to
help
to
make
the
students
realize
all
that
they
could
do
with
this
assignment.
When
one
boy
came
to
me
with
the
idea
of
writing
about
geothermal
energy,
I
asked
him
what
he
liked
to
do.
He
was
slightly
taken
aback
and
probably
questioned
my
motives
for
asking
a
question
like
that,
but
eventually
he
told
me
he
enjoyed
sports
like
golf.
I
didnOt
know
much
about
golf,
but
I
knew
that
the
environmental
tolls
maintaining
the
courses
would
probably
be
pretty
high,
so
I
told
him
if
he
ever
considered
doing
the
sustainability
of
golf.
He
told
me
he
had
never
thought
of
doing
something
like
that.
He
then
started
to
ask
about
the
various
aspects
he
could
touch
upon
and
whether
or
not
I
thought
they
were
good
ideas.
Finally,
I
was
able
to
invoke
some
eagerness.
Once
I
helped
them
to
realize
all
that
they
could
do
with
the
assignment,
the
students
seemed
to
start
to
enjoy
researching
and
writing
about
their
topics.
The
variety
of
projects
was
really
awesome.
One
student
did
her
paper
on
the
sustainability
of
the
fish
farming
industries
while
another
student
did
a
paper
on
how
sustainability
has
been
portrayed
in
recent
motion
pictures.
Being
able
to
see
the
difference
between
what
they
had
written
before
compared
to
what
they
had
written
afterwards
was
very
rewarding.
I
knew
that
what
I
had
done
had
impacted
their
writing
and
had
made
their
lives
(and
mine)
a
little
easier.
We
often
view
ourselves
as
the
ones
teaching
in
our
job;
however,
this
position
often
proves
to
be
an
opportunity
to
be
the
ones
being
taught.
This
job
as
an
opportunity
for
us
to
help
the
other
students,
being
a
WA
has
really
turned
into
an
opportunity
for
me
to
learn
about
writing
and
my
relationship
with
writing.
Being
an
engineer,
the
type
of
writing
I
do
is
almost
exclusively
technical.
Because
I
am
more
science
and
technically
focused
than
some
of
the
other
WAs,
I
have
often
been
paired
with
more
science
and
technically
based
classes.
Talking
with
professors
about
what
they
expect
their
students
to
accomplish
in
their
writing
has
really
helped
me
adjust
the
way
I
write
to
better
suit
my
writing
in
a
technical
field.
Even
though
they
may
not
be
my
specific
professors,
there
are
many
commonalities
to
what
the
professors
look
for
in
strong
technical
writing.
By
knowing
what
they
want
from
their
students,
I
am
able
to
figure
out
better
what
I
need
to
provide
for
my
professors.
This
also
allows
me
to
give
better
insight
to
the
students
that
I
WA.
This
job
has
proven
to
be
a
wonderful
opportunity
for
me.
I
am
able
to
work
with
students
and
help
them
improve
their
writing
while
also
improving
mine
all
at
the
same
time.
As
a
WA
I
have
grown
every
single
semester
and
look
forward
to
continuing
that
growth
this
coming
year.
