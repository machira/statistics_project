WA

My
personal
history
as
a
writer
was
probably
not
unlike
that
of
most
people
my
age.
I
was
taught
to
write
my
name
and
other
simple
phrases,
which
I
eventually
formed
into
sentences
and
then
paragraphs.
Yet,
even
though
I
am
fairly
sure
this
is
how
I
started,
it
is
not
what
I
first
remember
about
writing.
My
first
real
memories
are
of
writing
in
my
diary
that
I
got
as
a
gift
for
my
eighth
birthday.
I
treated
this
small
pink
book
as
a
close
personal
friend.
I
wrote
down
my
feelings,
thoughts,
and
fears
and,
for
some
reason
that
escapes
me
now,
what
I
ate
for
dinner
every
night.
It
is
the
first
instance
that
I
can
recall
being
excited
about
writing
down
my
ideas.
Later
in
life
I
would
be
exposed
to
several
other
forms
of
writing,
some
more
interesting
than
others.
However,
in
the
time
from
eight
years
old
until
now,
have
come
to
realize
that
writing,
both
for
school
and
for
fun,
is
one
of
the
most
frustrating
and
most
rewarding
parts
of
my
life.
It
is
a
constant
challenge
to
please
myself
as
a
writer.
It
is
a
skill
that
I
believe
can
be
honed
but
almost
never
perfected.
This
allows
people
to
grow
and
mature
with
every
essay,
story
or
poem.
I
feel
that
the
writing
I
have
done
over
the
course
of
my
life
demonstrates
this
growth.
It
allows
me
to
look
back
and
see
who
I
was
and
remember
what
I
have
done.
It
is
a
link
to
my
past
and
hopefully
the
key
to
my
future.
My
second
memory
of
writing
is
again
not
from
the
classroom
but
from
the
playground.
When
I
was
in
fourth
and
fifth
grade
my
best
friend
Tammy
and
I
had
grand
ambitions
of
forming
a
band.
To
accomplish
this
dream
we
begged
our
parents
for
synthesizers
and
began
a
song
writing
regiment.
Everyday
at
lunchtime
we
would
sit
on
the
blacktop
and
scribble
down
new
lyrics
to
the
latest
Bon
Jovi
tune.
We
wrote
about
everything
from
our
prepubescent
ideas
of
unrequited
love
to
songs
about
the
injustices
of
homework
and
chores.
It
didn't
matter
in
the
least
that
we
were
stealing
melodies
from
other
songs
or
that
neither
one
of
us
could
read
music
or
actually
play
our
electronic
key
boards,
in
our
minds
we
were
real
musicians.
If
someone
had
told
me
then
that
I
was
actually
practicing
my
creative
writing
and
poetry
skills
I
would
have
had
no
idea
what
they
were
talking
about.
However,
that
is
exactly
what
I
was
doing.
I
was
probably
complaining
about
the
"stupid"
essay
I
has
to
write
in
English
about
what
I
did
on
my
summer
vacation
while
at
the
same
time
I
was
writing
for
my
own
enjoyment.
By
the
end
of
elementary
school
I
must
have
shown
a
relatively
decent
level
of
skill
in
reading
and
writing
because
I
was
recommended
for
the
gifted
and
talented
program
in
the
middle
school.
This
program,
known
as
LAMP
(Language
Arts
Mentor
Program)
would
turn
out
to
be
one
of
the
most
significant
components
of
my
education.
For
two
periods
a
day
for
the
next
three
years
I
had
class
with
the
same
thirteen
people
in
the
same
room
everyday.
With
the
exception
of
one
eight
grade
reading
course,
all
of
these
classes
were
with
the
same
remarkable
woman,
Mrs.
Mary
Norris.
Mrs.
Norris
had
been
teaching
the
LAMP
classes
for
several
years
and
treated
every
student
she
taught
like
one
of
her
own
children.
From
the
first
day
of
class
when
she
locked
my
friend
Joey
Alleffi
in
the
closet
to
make
a
point
about
the
importance
of
imagination,
I
knew
this
was
going
to
be
different
than
any
other
class
I
had
ever
taken.
Mrs.
Norris
taught
us
to
look
at
writing
as
not
just
a
form
of
correspondence
or
communication
of
facts,
but
as
a
means
of
expression.
I
remember
being
struck
by
this
concept,
even
though
I
had
been
expressing
my
thoughts
and
feelings
in
songs
and
diaries
fort
years.
To
me,
this
was
different.
This
was
school!
I
could
now
write
about
how
I
felt
about
a
story
and
what
it
meant
to
me
instead
of
just
"reporting"
on
it
and
listing
the
basic
facts.
So,
not
only
did
I
no
longer
have
to
take
spelling
tests,
I
could
now
write
about
my
opinions
and
get
graded
on
it.
English
quickly
became
my
favorite
subject.
Another
remarkable
thing
about
this
class,
and
more
specifically
about
this
teacher,
was
how
hard
I
found
myself
working.
I
learned
to
look
at
writing
as
a
creative
process
rather
than
a
one
step
task.
We
would
often
debate
issues
brought
up
by
books
or
stories
until
we
hit
on
a
topic
that
Mrs.
Norris
saw
as
a
jumping
off
point
for
an
essay.
Therefore,
by
the
time
we
actually
began
writing
we
had
already
formed
opinions,
made
arguments
to
support
these
opinions
and
voiced
them
to
our
peers.
I
remember
several
times
when
the
class
would
be
split
down
the
middle
on
things
like
whether
the
major
conflict
in
a
story
was
man
versus
society
or
man
versus
himself.
I
would
feel
so
strongly
about
my
view
that
I
would
work
on
my
essay
for
hours
to
make
sure
that
my
point
was
clear
and
supported.
We
would
talk
about
the
issues
at
lunch,
in
gym
and
even
on
the
phone
at
night.
It
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
I
can
remember
being
excited
to
learn
and
impress
my
teacher.
I
think
one
of
the
main
reasons
I
felt
that
way
was
because
of
the
way
we
were
treated.
Mrs.
Norris
made
us
feel
intelligent
but
humble
in
that
we
all
knew
we
had
a
lot
more
to
learn.
She
respected
us
as
young
adults
and
we
returned
this
treatment
with
enthusiasm
for
knowledge.
Sometimes
I
even
think
if
Mrs.
Norris
had
taught
pre-algebra
I
would
be
a
math
major
right
now.
When
I
graduated
from
eighth
grade
I
won
the
award
for
excellence
in
English
which
Mrs.
Norris
presented
to
me
in
front
of
the
whole
school
and
I
was
so
overwhelmed
that
I
almost
lost
it
on
the
stage.
I
still
cherish
that
tiny
little
trophy
as
one
of
my
most
prized
possessions.
Well,
if
junior
high
was
the
Golden
Age
of
my
history
of
a
writer,
the
first
couple
years
of
high
school
would
be
most
like
the
Dark
Ages.
My
English
teacher
freshman
year
was
not
quite
the
inspiring
free
spirit
that
Mrs.
Norris
had
been.
However,
still
beaming
from
my
award
and
eager
to
tackle
to
the
challenge
of
freshman
composition
I
told
myself
it
would
not
be
that
bad.
A
few
weeks
later
I
was
exploring
my
career
options
in
fields
in
which
the
only
writing
requirement
was
my
signature
and
or
initials.
Since
I
had
no
real
interest
in
picking
up
packages
for
a
living,
I
was
beginning
to
become
slightly
disillusioned
about
my
future.
No
matter
what
I
did
in
this
class
I
could
not
receive
a
grade
higher
that
a
B-.
Slowly
my
enthusiasm
tapered
off
and
my
seat
in
the
last
row
became
a
blessing.
I
never
raised
my
hand,
was
never
called
on
and
began
to
accept
my
B-'s
without
question.
I
began
thinking
that
I
really
wasn't
that
good
at
writing
so
I
stopped
doing
it
all
together
unless
required.
There
was
no
more
journal
writing
and
I
stopped
writing
down
all
my
thoughts
and
ideas.
I
even
cut
short
my
prewriting
process
and
opted
for
the
no
frills
quick
write
approach.
Writing
had
once
again
become
work
that
made
even
earth
science
look
enjoyable.
1
didn't
get
out
of
this
funk
until
I
reached
the
beginning
of
my
junior
year.
Interestingly,
it
came
as
I
had
one
of
the
worst
English
teachers
I
have
ever
come
across.
I
hated
this
woman
with
a
passion
that
I
do
not
think
I
will
ever
experience
again.
And,
after
a
short
time,
the
feeling
became
mutual.
My
problem
with
this
person
was
that
she
was
extremely
close
minded
and
focused
on
a
very
narrow
agenda
of
what
she
considered
truths.
She
tolerated
very
little
diversion
from
her
path
of
ideas,
which
did
not
allow
much
room
for
interpretation
or
creativity.
At
first,
I
would
accept
her
rejection
of
my
ideas
and
just
sit
quietly
for
the
rest
of
the
period
staring
at
the
paper
clips
embedded
in
the
ceiling
tiles.
But
eventually
I
started
to
fight
back.
I
would
read
the
assignments
several
times,
highlighting
examples
to
back
up
my
opinions.
I
would
raise
my
hand
three
or
four
times
to
reargue
my
ideas
with
new
examples
I
would
discover
during
the
class.
I
began
prewriting
again
and
editing
my
papers
over
and
over
again
to
make
sure
that
she
did
not
get
the
satisfaction
of
taking
off
two
points
for
a
punctuation
error.
I
was
motivated
again,
which
made
me
enjoy
and
take
pride
in
the
work
I
was
doing.
It
was
around
this
time
that
I
began
keeping
a
journal
again.
I
also
began
writing
poetry,
first
modeled
after
Shakespearean
sonnets
and
then
my
own
forms
of
free
verse.
I
even
started
writing
songs
again
thanks
to
some
inspiration
from
the
Seattle
grunge
seen.
I
discovered
and
took
a
liking
to
journalistic
writing
and
started
working
on
both
the
school
paper
and
the
yearbook.
I
took
my
English
award
off
the
trophy
shelf
and
put
it
on
the
desk
in
my
room.
I
was
ready
to
enjoy
writing
again.
In
my
senior
year
of
high
school
I
got
to
take
an
AP
English
course
(after
some
schmoozing
and
angry
letter
writing
on
my
part
because
the
aforementioned
teacher
refused
to
recommend
me).
But
when
I
got
in
I
found
it
to
be
an
important
experience.
I
wouldn't
say
I
learned
a
lot
more
about
writing
but
I
got
a
taste
of
what
I
was
going
to
be
expected
of
me
in
college.
My
final
project
for
the
class
was
a
thirty-page
paper
plus
an
hour-long
oral
report.
I
chose
to
give
mock
psychological
profiles
on
several
Shakespearean
characters.
In
order
to
do
this
accurately
I
had
to
do
research
not
only
on
Shakespeare,
but
also
on
various
psychological
philosophies
and
techniques.
It
was
one
of
the
first
times
I
had
to
do
as
much
research
as
actual
writing.
This
task
made
it
a
little
less
shocking
when
I
got
my
first
fifteen-page
paper
assignment
in
Introduction
to
the
Modern
World
in
my
first
semester
of
my
freshman
year.
This
research
factor
is
one
of
the
main
differences
I
noticed
in
my
transition
from
high
school
to
college
writing.
College
professors
don't
just
want
to
hear
an
opinion
or
a
stream
of
facts
copied
out
of
a
book,
they
want
(and
demand)
evidence
to
back
up
every
point
a
student
makes
in
a
paper.
This
is
true
for
all
subjects
from
history
and
English
to
psychology
and
even
biology.
A
lab
report
can
not
be
made
better
with
flowery
language
and
convoluted
words.
They
require
an
intricate
understanding
of
the
subject
matter
that
must
come
across
in
the
documentation.
BS
will
never
fill
up
a
lab
report;
I
speak
from
experience.
Well-researched
examples
have
become
a
crucial
part
of
papers
I
have
written
in
every
subject
I
have
taken
in
college.
They
are
what
holds
opinions
and
facts
together
to
form
a
thorough
and
communicative
piece
of
writing.
So
now
here
I
am
about
to
enter
my
senior
year
of
college
and
I
would
consider
myself
relatively
well
schooled
in
the
art
of
writing.
However,
it
is
one
area
of
education
that
I
believe
few
if
any
can
say
they
have
mastered.
It
is
a
constant
learning
process
where
people
can
learn
both
from
themselves
and
others.
In
my
"lifetime
as
a
writer"
I
have
come
to
learn
many
things
such
as
how
some
teachers
don't
like
it
when
you
try
to
be
funny,
erasers
are
a
good
investment
and,
unfortunately
for
me,
spelling
does
count.
But
most
of
all
I
have
learned
that
decent
writing
can
always
be
made
into
good
writing
and
great
writing
can
almost
always
be
made
better.
It
is
one
of
the
most
important
and
useful
skills
that
anyone
can
have.
It
is
also,
in
every
sense
of
the
word,
a
process.
But
it
is
a
process
that
I
have
come
to
love
and
respect
and
will
use
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
I
hope
my
Renaissance
years
in
writing
are
yet
to
come.
