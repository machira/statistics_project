Returning
WA
Narrative
Summer
2009
I
received
my
acceptance
into
the
CWP
last
summer.
I
signed
my
contract
and
completed
my
new
WA
narrative
with
no
idea
what
the
coming
year
would
bring.
It
was
more
than
obvious
what
kind
of
WA
experience
I
wanted
to
have.
Just
from
working
with
the
WA
in
my
FYS
I
knew
I
wanted
to
work
with
motivated
(and
willing)
students,
and
to
have
an
easy
going
professor
whose
assignments
were
interesting
and
could
be
well
understood
by
the
class.
Throughout
the
new
WA
orientation,
I
became
anxious
and
doubtful
that
I
would
get
to
have
this
great
WA
experience.
After
being
warned
of
all
of
the
not
so
fun
aspects
of
the
jobNnot
being
able
hunt
down
a
professor,
or
a
student,
and
the
best
part---dealing
with
students
that
do
not
want
or
appreciate
helpNI
was
suddenly
terrified
of
what
was
to
come.
The
more
we
went
over
odd
and
uncomfortable
situations,
the
easier
it
was
for
me
to
imagine
myself
in
them.
I
was
overcome
with
anxiety
as
we
sat
and
waited
to
find
out
our
WA
assignmentsNthe
assignment
that
would
decide
the
stress
level
for
the
following
year.
As
I
reviewed
the
assignment
sheet,
I
noticed
that
unlike
almost
everyone
else,
I
hadnOt
been
assigned
a
class.
Next
to
my
name
read:
NProJectO.
Confused,
I
didnOt
know
if
this
difference
would
prove
to
be
a
good
or
a
bad
one.
Had
I
become
extremely
lucky,
or
was
this
difference
one
that
would
make
my
job
much
harder.
It
turns
out
that
it
was
the
latter:
the
word
NProJectO
would
not
only
make
my
first
year
as
a
WA
enjoyable
and
rewarding,
but
it
would
prove
to
change
my
Lafayette
experience
entirely.
It
turns
out
that
the
skills
we
had
gone
over
during
orientation,
and
everything
that
I
had
expected
from
my
job
as
a
WA
would
not
apply
to
my
work
at
ProJect.
Instead
of
peer
editing
with
Lafayette
students
I
would
work
with
adults
from
the
Easton
area
in
a
writing
workshop.
What
was
most
exciting
about
the
job,
was
the
motivation
and
the
courage
that
writers
at
ProJect
possessed.
Writing
was
not
something
that
had
been
seamlessly
integrated
into
their
everyday
lives,
not
something
that
they
overlooked-
it
was
and
is
extremely
important
because
it
serves
a
direct
and
immensely
important
purpose.
To
them,
writing
is
the
means
to
a
GED,
entrance
into
college,
a
better
job,
more
money,
the
ability
to
teach
their
children,
and
in
more
direct
terms,
their
ability
to
communicate.
In
other
words,
writing
means
more
than
a
good
grade
or
impressing
a
professor.
Being
a
writing
tutor
at
Poject
required
me
to
acquire
specific
teaching
and
editing
skills.
The
most
important
practice
was
making
sure
that
I
was
constantly
encouraging
my
students
and
pointing
out
what
they
were
doing
right
in
their
writing.
Many
of
them
had
suffered
somewhat
difficult
and/or
trying
circumstances
and
deserved
all
the
encouragement
and
positive
reinforcement
that
I
could
give.
I
learned
how
to
edit
their
work,
and
also
how
to
teach
to
them.
I
made
sure
to
always
keep
myself
at
their
level,
participating
with
them,
and
sharing
my
own
thoughts
and
ideas
as
I
received
theirs.
After
much
trial
and
error
I
realized
how
to
tailor
lesson
plans
to
their
needs
and
how
to
go
with
the
flow
and
exploit
Nteachable
momentsO
when
I
could
introduce
new,
useful
information.
One
time
during
a
teaching
workshop
we
practiced
writing
a
GED
essay
thatOs
prompt
involved
teaching
someone
else
how
to
do
something.
One
of
the
essay
ideas
that
someone
came
up
with
was
to
teach
another
person
how
to
make
a
bed.
Since
we
usually
practiced
essays
together
as
a
class,
I
immediately
dismissed
the
idea
when
it
came
to
writing
the
essay
because
I
didnOt
think
there
would
be
enough
to
talk
about.
Jessica,
my
co
worker,
suggested
that
we
use
the
idea.
As
we
started
putting
ideas
on
the
board
I
noticed
how
excited
the
women
in
the
class
were
getting.
They
kept
shouting
out
ideas,
giving
precise
details
I
never
would
have
thought
to
add.
What
I
hadnOt
realized
was
that
the
women
in
my
class
made
beds
for
a
living,
working
as
maids
for
a
nearby
hotel.
What
seemed
like
a
silly
essay
to
me
was
important
to
them
because
it
gave
them
a
chance
to
show
off
their
knowledge
and
expertise.
While
working
at
ProJect
IOve
learned
to
expect
the
unexpected,
to
go
with
the
flow,
and
let
my
students
decide
what
direction
the
class
will
go
in.
Many
of
the
students
in
our
writing
workshop
come
to
practice
the
essay
section
of
the
GED.
Occasionally
though,
students
come
with
a
more
personal
project
or
agenda.
One
woman
I
worked
with
asked
me
for
help
on
something
she
is
writing
for
her
son.
At
the
age
of
21,
she
has
had
her
second
child
and
is
keeping
a
journal
that
documents
her
daily
thoughts
and
experiences
with
him,
for
him
to
read
when
he
gets
older.
She
was
very
passionate
that
the
journal
be
kept
properly,
with
accurate
grammar
and
punctuation.
As
I
sat
reviewing
the
journal,
I
couldnOt
help
but
feel
incredibly
honored
to
be
included
in
such
a
project.
It
was
through
experiences
like
this
that
I
was
able
to
connect
with
my
students
on
a
personal
level.
In
most
classes
WAs
almost
always
read
research
based
essays
meant
to
help
teach
and
reinforce
subject
matter.
Since
the
GED
often
asks
personal
questions
of
students,
and
since
ProJect
encourages
that
students
document
their
goals
and
personal
history
on
paper
(in
order
to
clarify
and
then
complete
these
goals),
I
often
got
to
read
studentOs
personal
narratives.
It
was
through
these
narratives
that
I
got
to
know
them,
and
got
to
learn
about
their
interesting
and
sometimes
incredible
life
stories.
I
was
able
to
talk
to
a
man
my
own
age
about
his
life
in
the
Peruvian
rainforest,
discuss
how
to
find
the
perfect
man
with
a
woman
who
had
been
born
and
raised
in
brazil,
and
read
the
narrative
of
an
illegal
immigration
to
California
written
by
a
Ecuadorian
refugee.
For
them
writing
their
stories
not
only
helped
them
practice
English
and
essay
writing,
but
also
gave
them
a
sense
of
authority.
Something
special
happens
when
they
are
able
to
communicate
their
stories
to
me
through
pen
and
paper.
A
sense
of
agency
occurs
for
themNthat
they
are
not
only
documenting
their
stories,
but
they
are
making
a
mark
somehowNeven
if
it
is
just
within
the
classroom,
with
me
as
their
reader.
Being
able
to
write
their
stories
and
communicate
their
thoughts
is
empowering
for
them,
it
is
something
to
be
proud
of.
It
is
seeing
this
happen
first
hand
that
changed
my
view
on
writing
more
than
anything
else
in
my
life.
As
obvious
and
as
unnecessary
as
it
seems
to
say
this,
working
at
ProJect
was
a
very
humbling
experience.
At
Lafayette
weOve
been
endlessly
lectured
to
about
the
importance
of
writing.
It
is
engrained
in
our
curriculum
and
reflected
in
the
basis
of
FYS
and
Vast
classes
and
other
writing
and
humanity
requirements.
At
Lafayette
we
realize
how
important
writing
is,
yet
we
seem
to
forget
how
lucky
we
are
to
be
able
to
use
it
in
the
way
that
we
do.
I
am
lucky
to
be
able
to
write
and
in
turn
to
enjoy
the
opportunities
that
it
affords
me.
I
can
appreciate
everything
that
IOve
experienced
to
become
the
writer
than
I
am.
I
entered
Lafayette
with
a
very
skewed
perception
of
how
to
practice
and
exercise
my
love
of
writing.
In
WA
staff
meetings
we
scoff
at
how
professors
on
campus
ignorantly
link
WAs
with
the
English
department,
but
I
too
had
assumed
the
same
connection
upon
arriving
at
Lafayette.
In
high
school
I
loved
English
classes
because
they
gave
me
a
chance
to
write
creatively.
I
assumed
that
I
would
also
enjoy
participating
in
the
English
department
at
Lafayette.
I
only
took
one
English
class
my
freshman
year
and
was
interested
in
the
course
topics
and
materialNthe
professor
was
also
someone
I
respected
and
admired.
In
my
sophomore
year,
after
taking
more
English
classes,
I
realized
that
I
didnOt
enjoy
most
college
English
classes
after
all.
Since
I
entered
college
contemplating
an
English
major,
I
took
literary
questions
and
a
literary
history
course
in
my
sophomore
year.
I
found
that
I
had
a
problem
with
both
coursesNI
was
always
more
interested
in
the
historical
context
of
the
writing
than
in
the
text
itself.
After
a
series
of
papersNmost
of
which
I
didnOt
do
so
well
on,
I
realized
that
I
hated
literary
criticism
and
all
the
textual
analysis
that
accompanies
it.
In
those
classes
I
absolutely
hated
writing
because
I
could
never
write
about
what
I
wanted
to.
I
found
that
the
place
I
like
writing
the
most
is
in
the
history
department.
My
favorite
piece
of
writing
that
I
did
during
my
sophomore
year
at
Lafayette
was
one
on
Jane
Addams
and
the
founding
on
the
Hull
House.
It
was
a
semester
long
paper
for
my
VAST
course,
for
which
we
chose
our
own
topic
and
did
our
own
research.
I
was
able
to
read,
research,
and
develop
my
own
unique
spin
on
a
well
documented
historical
event.
I
found
that
I
still
loved
to
writeNespecially
when
I
didnOt
have
to
do
textual
explication.
Another
notable
writing
experience
I
had
during
my
sophomore
year
was
in
a
government-law
class.
It
was
a
somewhat
strange
assignment,
one
for
which
I
had
much
disdain
and
am
still
not
sure
if
I
got
much
out
of.
The
assignment
was
to
create
a
dialogue
between
two
fictional
characters
and
myselfNto
be
more
specific,
Jean
Valjean
and
Javert
from
Victor
HugoOs
Les
Miserables
and
myselfNin
which
we
discuss
a
court
case
we
NobservedO
together
at
the
Easton
Court
House.
After
several
trips
back
and
forth
to
the
court
house
to
find
the
court
case
I
wanted
to
write
about,
I
chose
one
about
a
man
who
had
been
arrested
on
several
drug
and
weapons
counts.
I
felt
crazy
writing
a
dialogue
between
me,
Jean
Valjean
and
Javert
(contrasting
our
thoughts
and
opinions
on
how
the
court
case
reflected
justice).
My
professor
graded
each
draft
of
this
dialogue
meticulously,
mercilessly
asking
questions
about
word
choice
and
placement
(which
essentially
ruled
out
any
hope
of
bull-shitting
the
paper).
Though
it
was
an
odd
experience,
that
I
am
glad
to
be
down
with,
I
can
appreciate
the
unconventional
assignment.
It
allowed
me
to
be
creative
and
to
imagine
thoughts
and
voices
of
other
characters.
Life
beyond
college
doesnOt
usually
call
for
writing
essays
with
introductions,
body
paragraphs
and
conclusions.
It
was
an
interesting
thought
to
consider
that
someday
instead
of
writing
mere
dialogue,
I
could
actually
be
writing
a
screenplay,
or
something
else
having
to
do
with
theatre
or
film.
Writing
the
Jane
Addams
Paper
and
the
court
house
dialogue
were
experiences
that
gave
me
confidence
in
my
writing
abilities.
In
the
fall
IOm
taking
two
English
classes
that
focus
on
writingNa
creative
writing
class
and
a
writing
genres
class.
I
realize
however
that
I
have
much
more
practicing
to
doNand
I
am
grateful
that
I
still
have
two
more
years
of
classes
at
Lafayette
to
do
just
that.
