Writing
Associate
Assignment
My
Literary
History
The
night
before
my
first
day
of
kindergarten
I
knelt
on
a
wooden
chair
in
front
of
my
kitchen
table.
My
mother
sat
next
to
me
folding
laundry.
"Good,
Beth.
That
looks
great!"
I
remember
holding
my
number
two
pencil
with
the
rubber
finger
grip
and
writing
my
name
over
and
over
again
between
the
blue
lines
on
the
yellow
paper.
I
wanted
to
get
it
right
before
I
went
to
bed.
With
two
elementary
school
teachers
as
parents,
I
couldn't
escape
learning
if
I
tried.
They
were
not
overbearing,
but
they
always
put
a
great
emphasis
on
education.
I
remember
my
mom,
who
teaches
first
grade,
patiently
naming
each
letter
magnet
on
my
Playskool
chalkboard.
My
dad
would
quiz
me
with
questions
like
"What
letter
does
cat
start
with?"
And
so
my
exposure
to
writing,
or
at
least
letters,
began.
Snakey
S,
Zipper
Z,
and
the
rest
of
the
letter
characters
posted
all
around
the
room
were
a
friendly
welcome
to
first
grade.
With
the
help
of
the
subject
of
phonics,
we
began
putting
our
letter
knowledge
to
use
by
reading
and
writing.
Some
of
my
favorite
writing
activities,
even
to
this
day,
were
the
writing
prompts
like
"If
I
had
a
monster..or
"If
I
was
bird...".
This
was
my
introduction
to
creative
writing.
At
an
age
when
you
were
constantly
instructed
not
to
lie
or
make
up
stories,
it
was
great
to
have
an
outlet
for
your
imagination
to
run
wild.
And
a
star
on
your
paper
was
the
best
reward.
As
I
moved
up
the
grade
levels
in
elementary
school,
I
was
introduced
to
more
factual
writing.
Third
grade
brought
about
the
famous
book
report,
which
consisted
of
a
single
page
worksheet
with
Title,
Author,
Characters,
Setting,
Plot,
and
Conclusion
written
down
the
side.
Then
there
were
the
short
history
and
science
reports.
With
all
of
these,
the
appearance
of
the
paper
became
almost
as
important
as
the
writing
itself.
Each
report
was
encased
in
a
protective
plastic
shield
or,
for
something
really
fancy,
it
was
hole
punched
and
tied
with
yam.
My
first
negative
experience
with
writing
came
in
fourth
grade.
Every
day
Mrs.
Kennedy
passed
out
our
blue
book
journals
and
we
would
write
in
them
for
the
first
ten
minutes
of
class.
Looking
back,
I
can
see
more
of
the
value
in
this
assignment,
however,
at
the
time,
I
couldn't
understand
how
we
were
expected
to
rid
ourselves
of
personal
problems
in
a
ten-minute
freewrite.
Not
only
were
we
writing
within
two
feet
of
each
other,
but
also
the
teacher
read
through
them.
"I'll
be
the
only
one
looking
at
them,"
Mrs.
Kennedy
told
us
as
if
that
was
some
sort
of
comfort.
Although
I
have
found
a
love
for
journal
writing
over
the
years,
I
still
believe
you
can't
be
completely
honest
about
yourself
when
you
feel
as
though
your
writing
for
someone
else
or
that
there's
a
chance
your
writing
could
fall
into
the
wrong
hands.
I
remember
listening
to
one
of
my
friend's
older
sisters
whine
about
how
she
wrote
a
hurtful
note
about
a
friend
and
somehow
the
girl
saw
it.
She
looked
down
at
her
sister
and
me
and
told
us,
with
her
junior
high
wisdom,
"Never
write
anything
on
paper
that
you
wouldn't
want
anyone
to
see."
Aside
from
my
own
journal,
I
think
I've
followed
this
piece
of
advice
fairly
well.
Fifth
and
sixth
grade
were
more
of
the
same
fill-in-the-bank
type
of
summary
reports.
The
amount
of
research
required
increased,
but
other
than
that
we
were
still
answering
basic
questions
about
aquatic
life
and
historical
events.
An
addition
to
the
writing
assignments
was
the
visual
aid
component.
Suddenly
your
writing
project
was
incomplete
without
a
paper
mache
manatee
or
a
shadow
box
of
Dolly
Madison
saving
George
Washington's
portrait
from
the
burning
White
House.
(Oh
yes,
I
did
both.)
But
as
sarcastic
and
cynical
I
sound
about
the
quality
of
writing
expected
of
my
later
elementary
years,
I
think
it
was
appropriate
and
it
provided
a
strong
basis
for
my
factual
writing.
The
worksheets
we
used
as
guide
lines
taught
me
to
pick
out
the
important
points
of
research
material
and
format
a
structured
paper.
Also,
by
learning
the
major
aspects
of
books
and
literature,
such
as
the
setting
and
the
conclusion,
I
could
later
write
about
their
importance
in
the
book
as
a
whole.
The
writing
of
these
years
taught
me
how
to
look
for
what
one
of
my
high
school
teachers
would
call
the
"meat"
of
my
papers.
In
fifth
grade,
I
had
another
memorable
experience
with
writing.
Our
class
was
responsible
for
putting
on
a
play
for
health
class
about
healthy
decisions.
We
had
to
prepare
everything
from
the
script
to
the
costumes.
I
was
placed
in
the
writing
committee
where
a
group
of
five
of
us
brainstormed
and
delegated
responsibility
for
the
different
scenes.
The
play
was
what
you
would
have
expected
from
thirty
ten
year-olds,
but
I
remembered
how
much
I
enjoyed
creating
something
in
that
atmosphere,
starting
with
nothing
and
through
cooperation
and
compromise
ending
with
a
story.
I
also
remember
how
amazing
it
felt
to
have
something
I
had
written
come
to
life
through
the
actors.
As
corny
as
it
may
sound,
I
felt
somehow
empowered
listening
to
my
classmates
stand
on
stage
shout
lines
I
had
written.
Seventh
and
eighth
grade
were
important
years
in
my
knowledge
of
English
as
a
whole.
Mrs.
St.
Amaud,
my
teacher
for
both
years,
was
a
grammar
drill
sergeant.
She
single-handedly
explained,
enforced,
and
etched
into
my
brain
every
law
of
grammar
I
have
ever
had
to
use.
Standing
only
about
five
foot
three
and
always
smiling,
she
seemed
harmless
enough,
but
equipped
with
an
English
grammar
book
and
sentence
worksheets
she
was
merciless.
On
top
of
weekly
vocabulary
words
and
reading
assignments,
we
would
have
a
nightly
assignment
of
75
sentences
to
break
apart
and
label
the
part
of
speech
and
function
of
every
word.
Through
all
of
our
griping
Mrs.
St.
Amaud
would
simply
smile.
She
knew
what
we
would
later
learn;
she
was
doing
us
a
great
service
in
the
long
run.
By
the
end
of
the
year,
I
could
not
read
a
sentence
without
thinking
subject
...
linking
verb..
.predicate
nominative..
.gerund
used
as
the
object
of
the
preposition.
No
matter
how
dry
I
considered
grammar,
it
truly
is
the
backbone
of
language.
In
an
area
as
subjective
as
writing,
it
is
something
objective.
I
also
found
it
extremely
helpful
when
I
started
to
learn
French.
Eighth
grade
brought
another
opportunity
at
creative
writing.
Every
student
was
required
to
submit
an
original
short
story
to
his/her
English
teacher
for
the
school's
Writer
of
the
Month
Award.
My
story
was
about
an
avalanche.
We
worked
in
pairs
the
week
before
they
were
due
proofreading
and
making
suggestions.
Mrs.
St.
Amaud
chose
mine
to
submit
to
the
school
competition
round
of
judging.
Receiving
this
kind
of
approval
from
a
teacher
I
respected
so
much
still
makes
me
smile.
From
the
time
we
start
writing,
teachers
tell
us
there
is
no
right
or
wrong
way
to
write,
but
at
this
moment
I
felt
like
I
did
something
right.
My
confidence
was
boosted
even
more
when
the
story
won
at
the
school
level.
I
remember
how
incredible
it
felt
to
get
recognition
for
something
I
had
worked
hard
on.
My
parents
were
proud.
My
dad
even
brought
copies
of
the
story
to
his
school
with
him,
which
was
a
little
embarrassing.
The
initial
shock
of
high
school
writing
quickly
deflated
my
ego.
The
gap
in
the
expectations
of
the
teachers
between
eighth
grade
and
ninth
grade
was
amazing.
The
book
report
I
had
learned
to
write
in
my
sleep
dropped
of
the
face
of
the
earth,
and
English
teachers
referred
to
it
as
if
it
were
the
black
sheep
of
the
literature
assignment
family.
My
first
English
assignment
in
high
school
was
a
character
sketch
of
Watson
from
a
Sherlock
Holmes
story
we
read
in
class.
On
the
day
our
teacher
returned
the
papers,
he
stood
up
in
front
of
the
class
and
said,
"I'm
going
to
read
you
two
papers
that
were
very
well
written.
Use
these
as
examples
when
you
think
about
your
rewrites."
I
was
fairly
confident
I
had
turned
in
a
decent
paper
and
I
was
half
expecting
him
to
read
my
paper
as
one
of
the
two
"well
written"
papers.
When
I
saw
the
C
on
my
paper,
I
did
a
double
take.
I
had
never
received
a
C
on
a
paper
in
my
life!
In
my
mind,
I
had
done
the
assignment
they
way
he
asked
and
I
immediately
started
building
up
defenses
in
my
mind.
He
was
just
trying
to
shake
our
confidence
and
prove
how
little
we
knew.
He'll
slowly
raise
our
grades
just
so
it
will
look
like
he
taught
us
more,
I
thought.
Looking
back,
I
think
this
was
more
a
positive
experience
in
writing
even
though
I
know
at
the
time
I
would
have
considered
it
a
negative
one.
My
anger
and
disappointment
motivated
me
to
work
harder
and
prove
myself
to
this
man
who
I
felt
believed
that
I
was
a
bad
writer.
The
amount
of
writing
involved
in
classes
outside
of
English
also
shocked
me
when
I
got
to
high
school.
Miss
Lavoie,
my
history
teacher
for
all
four
years,
was
my
savior
in
this
area.
When
I
arrived
in
high
school,
I
remember
not
even
knowing
what
a
thesis
was.
I
felt
my
face
drop
as
I
received
the
worksheet
explaining
the
first
assignment
for
my
world
civilization
class.
"In
your
opinion,
what
were
the
causes
for
the
fall
of
the
Roman
Empire.
Explain
fully
and
make
your
thesis
clear.
3-5
pages."
For
the
first
time,
I
was
not
simply
explaining
an
event
in
history
or
a
famous
historical
figure.
I
was
using
my
knowledge
of
the
period
and
asserting
my
own
opinion
into
the
paper.
We
were
given
an
essay
like
this
every
other
week
freshmen
year
and
every
week
sophomore
and
junior
year.
It
was
in
Miss
Lavoie's
class
that
I
also
had
to
come
to
terms
with
one
of
my
most
challenging
aspects
of
writing,
the
time
element.
Before
high
school,
all
my
tests
had
been
fill-in
the-blanks
or
short
answer
type
tests.
Miss
Lavoie's
first
test
consisted
of
ten
paragraphs.
I
have
and
probably
always
will
be
a
slow
writer.
That
first
test
was
one
of
the
most
frustrating
experiences
with
writing
I
have
ever
encountered.
I
finished
eight
out
of
the
ten
paragraphs
in
the
fifty-minute
class
period.
I
knew
what
I
wanted
to
write
about
the
words
just
wouldn't
come
fast
enough.
The
information
was
there
in
my
head;
I
just
didn't
have
the
time
to
retrieve
it.
Later
in
the
year,
Miss
Lavoie
allotted
us
extra
time
and
I
learned
to
write
faster.
However,
it
was
in
this
class
that
I
realized
my
true
hatred
for
time
limits.
I
also
learned
from
Miss
Lavoie
how
to
write
a
research
paper.
She
broke
us
in
by
assigning
the
Advanced
Placement
Examination
Document
Based
Questions
(DBQs)
which
are
essay
questions
accompanied
by
excerpts
from
historical
texts
that
must
be
used
and
cited
in
the
essay.
This
is
the
type
of
writing
I
find
most
agonizing
and
tedious.
Writing
that
requires
such
a
strict
and
formal
format
makes
me
nervous
and
distracts
me
from
the
ideas
I'm
trying
to
convey.
However,
I
recognize
the
importance
of
research
papers,
and
I
feel
an
incredible
sense
of
accomplishment
whenever
I
finish
one.
This
is
a
style
I
put
into
use
about
twice
a
year
in
my
history
and
science
classes.
During
my
sophomore
and
junior
years,
I
was
exposed
to
poetry.
I
appreciated,
and
still
do
to
an
extent,
poetry
the
way
you
appreciate
the
beauty
and
fluid-like
sounds
of
a
foreign
language.
I
enjoyed
studying
and
reading
it,
but
in
many
cases
I
felt
as
though
I
was
missing
its
depth.
The
more
we
discussed
and
wrote
about
poetry,
the
more
I
began
to
feel
the
rhythm
necessary
to
understand
it.
However,
I
know
I'm
still
working
on
grasping
it
completely.
My
first
surge
of
confidence
came
from
the
approval
of
my
junior
year
English
teacher,
Mr.
Maniotis.
He
asked
us
to
write
a
poem
based
on
the
style
of
Walt
Whitman's
"Song
of
Myself
I
appreciated
the
lack
of
rhyme
and
meter
in
Whitman's
poem
and
felt
comfortable
trying
to
imitate
it.
Mr.
Maniotis
liked
it
and
sent
to
a
junior
writer's
contest.
It
didn't
receive
any
recognition,
but
the
fact
that
he
thought
it
had
a
chance
gave
me
faith
in
my
understanding
of
poetry.
Between
my
junior
and
senior
years
of
high
school,
I
attended
a
summer
program
at
St.
Paul's
School,
a
private
boarding
school
in
Concord,
NH,
where
I
witnessed
one
of
the
best
uses
of
writing
I
have
ever
seen.
The
program
required
each
student
to
take
along
with
his/her
major
course
a
writing
course.
The
writing
course
closely
resembled
Lafayette
College's
English
110
in
its
use
of
self-reflection
in
writing.
Students
were
required
to
keep
a
journal
and
write
a
total
of
20
journal
entries
during
the
five-week
program.
Unlike
my
fourth
grade
mornings,
this
was
a
time
in
my
life
filled
with
change
and
activity.
I
was
away
from
home
for
the
first
time
and
surrounded
by
250
new
people.
We
could
write
wherever
and
whenever
we
were
comfortable.
At
the
end
of
the
program,
students
were
asked
to
choose
three
of
their
journal
entries
they
did
not
mind
sharing.
The
teachers
collected
them,
pieced
excerpts
together,
and,
during
our
final
assembly,
six
teachers
took
turns
reading
from
them.
For
twenty
minutes,
we
listened
to
the
anxieties,
realizations,
and
memories
that
we
all
had
experienced
during
the
program
and
would
carry
with
us
for
life.
Some
were
feelings
we
had
expressed
vocally
to
each
other;
others
were
feelings
we
were
afraid
to
show.
But
as
our
teachers
read
our
private
thoughts
anonymously
aloud,
we
just
heard
truth
after
truth.
The
reading
brought
unity
and
closure.
I
feel
like
I
was
fairly
well
prepared
to
the
level
of
writing
at
college.
What
I
was
not
prepared
for
my
freshman
year,
especially
second
semester,
was
the
amount
of
writing.
I
felt
myself
juggling
writing
assignments
at
times.
However,
one
helpful
tool
I
only
began
using
in
college
was
the
drafting
of
papers.
Most
of
my
papers
I
turned
in
for
high
school
were
rough
drafts
fresh
off
the
printer.
My
college
professors
thankfully
would
not
allow
for
this.
The
requirement
of
rough
drafts
saved
me
from
waiting
until
the
last
minute.
Peer
editing
and
meetings
with
my
WA
were
also
new
and
helpful
experiences,
which
aided
me
in
adjusting
to
the
expectations
of
college
professors.
I
watched
as
my
rough
drafts
became
polished
by
the
time
they
were
turned
in
to
be
graded.
Journalism
was
one
style
of
writing
I
never
experienced
before
college.
The
first
story
I
turned
in
to
The
Lafayette
in
the
fall
consisted
of
lengthy,
complex
sentences
and
many
unnecessary
details.
By
the
time
the
story
went
into
print,
I
did
not
even
recognize
it.
Working
on
the
paper
and
writing
for
my
Writing
for
Publications
class
taught
me
to
trim
down
my
writing.
Although
I
that
realize
not
everything
can
be
written
in
a
journalistic
style,
some
of
the
important
aspects
of
journalistic
writing,
such
as
brevity
and
clarity,
can
improve
everyday
writing.
Every
time
I
finish
a
course
involving
writing
I
think
to
myself,
"This
has
to
be
it.
What
else
could
I
possibly
learn?"
Yet,
every
year
another
professor
teaches
me
something
new
about
writing.
I've
learned
if
you
keep
practicing
and
implementing
the
knowledge
you
pick
up
along
the
way,
you're
writing
will
improve
sometimes
without
you
noticing.
It's
a
lifelong
process
and
I
hope
whatever
I
do
after
college
involves
writing
in
some
way.
