3/15/97
As
a
child,
there
is
always
some
aspect
of
school
which
a
person
dreads,
whether
it
1$
having
to
be
away
from
her
parents
all
day
or
tackling
a
mathematics
problem
which
appears
impossible.
For
me,
this
stressful
task
was
reading
and
writing
because
it
was
very
stressful
to
realise
that
I
was
different
and
slower
to
learn
than
the
other
children
in
the
class.
Unfortunately,
the
connotations
that
came
with
this
problem
bothered
me
tremendously
and
because
of
that
I
only
read
and
wrote
when
I
was
forced
to
by
my
teachers
or
by
the
private
tutors
my
Mom
hired
for
me
because
she
knew
I
needed
extra
help,
I
think
if
someone
had
told
me
that
I
would
be
a
Writing
Associate
in
college
and
helping
other
people
write
I
would
have
laughed
at
them
and
thought
it
was
a
cruel
joke
because
I
was
always
the
child
who
received
a
report
card
with
an
excellent
for
effort
but
only
satisfactory
for
writing.
I
had
always
prayed
for
the
day
when
all
my
efforts
would
pay
off
and
I
am
glad
it
finally
has.
My
first
memory
of
writing
occurred
when
I
was
in
elementary
school
and
I
struggled
with
my
number
two
pencil
on
my
yellow
extra-wide
lined
paper
to
connect
my
lines
and
circles
to
construct
letters.
When
all
my
classmates
were
finished
and
ready
to
Issra
iuQT<<,
1
struggled
to
catch
up
and
soon
learned
that
I
was
learning
disabled.
Although
this
disability
is
not
extreme,
it
was
hard
for
me
to
deal
with
as
a
young
child
because
my
minor
deviation
from
the
norm
labeled
me
weird
and
not
wanted
and
at
that
age,
even
more
than
older
ages,
people
need
to
connect
with
their
peers.
After
I
was
placed
in
a
skills
class,
I
began
to
catch
up
to
the
other
people
in
my
class
and
began
to
feel
more
confident
but
I
still
dreaded
to
read
and
write
because
I
knew
that
I
was
worse
than
anyone
else
in
the
class.
Due
to
this
fact/
I
began
to
avoid
reading
and
writing
and
refused
to
do
either
in
my
spare
time
and
concentrated
on
the
things
that
I
was
better
at,
for
example;
swimming,
playing
tennis,
and
even
mathematics.
Another
problem
I
hadf
and
still
have,
which
accompanies
writing
is
my
lack
of
ability
to
spell.
In
elementary
school,
I
remember
writing
down
words
at
least
twenty
times
in
a
row
just
so
I
could
remember
how
to
spell
them
for
an
exam.
Once
my
teacher
came
by
my
desk
and
asked
why
I
was
doing
so
because
1
was
not
in
trouble
and
it
was
not
necessary.
I
replied,
because
this
is
the
only
way
I
know
how
to
leam
how
to
spell."
Although
she
let
me
continue,
she
told
my
mother
to
make
sure
she
knew
that
I
had
trouble
spelling,
Unfortunately,
this
was
not
the
end
of
my
problems
with
spelling;
just
five
years
ago
I
remember
sitting
at
my
desk
for
possibly
up
to
ten
minutes
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
spell
the
word
what.
-
I
knew
that
wat
was
not
correct
but
I
could
not
figure
out
the
right
way
to
spell
it.
This
frustration
often
stopped
me
from
writing
because
there
was
only
so
much
frustration
I
could
endure.
The
first
time
I
remember
writing
anything
that
I
was
proud
of
was
a
poem
wrote
in
second
grade
called
Pearl
Drops
which
was
a
narrative
story
about
snow
falling
on
a
baby's
nose.
When
I
look
at
it
now,
it
seems
flawed
in
many
ways
including
grammar
and
vocabulary
but
I
am
still
extremely
proud
of
it.
My
high
school
experience
was
primarily
about
learning
how
to
write
properly,
especially
research
papers.
I
remember
in
eleventh
grade
my
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Cooper,
assigned
my
first
research
paper.
I
can
honestly
say
my
heart
stopped
for
a
second
and
all
I
could
think
of
was
how
am
I
going
to
be
able
to
do
this,
let
alone
do
this
successfully,
because
it
sounded
like
the
most
complicated
and
hard
task
I
was
ever
assigned.
The
obligation
was
over
three
pages
and
was
supposed
to
take
a
month
and
one-half.
The
timeline
was
the
following;
1.
Three
days
to
pick
a
book
and
get
it
approved.
2.
One
week
to
read
the
book.
3.
Two
days
to
pick
a
topic
for
the
paper
and
get
it
approved.
4.
One
week
to
make
notecards
of
the
important
quotes
in
the
book.
5.
One
week
to
create
a
detailed
outline
and.
get
it
approved.
(the
iia.rd.est
step)
.
6.
One
week
for
a
rough
draft
to
be
read
by
my
teacher,
7.
One
week
to
create
a
final
draft.
At
that
time,
it
seemed
impossible
to
finish
a
one-hundred
page
play
in
a
week
and
finish
a
five
to
seven
page
research
paper
in
one
and
one-half
months.
I
remember
my
teacher
stating,
All
of
the
writing
you
do
here,
including
the
research
paper,
poems,
and
essays,
will
help
you
prepare
us
for
college.^
The
only
thing
I
remember
thinking
was;
yeah
right,
research
papers
are
^ust
another
method
of
torturing
us
and
finding
more
work
for
us
to
do.
When
I
repeated
these
steps
for
another
research
paper
my
senior
year,
I
thought
the
process
was
tedious
but
not
as
hard.
As
I
look
back
on
writing
my
two
research
papers
in
high
school
I
think
how
lucky
I
was
to
have
that
experience.
Although
I
dreaded
every
minute
of
it
because
my
friends
from
other
schools
did
not
have
to
do
it
and
I
saw
no
point
to
it,
it
taught
me
how
to
write
not
only
research
papers
but
also
any
type
of
paper.
I
think
the
most
important
thing
it
taught
me
was
the
confidence
that
I
could
write
anything
I
need
and
want
to.
My
first
semester
freshman
year
came
in
with
a
big
bang.
Not
only
did
I
have
a
freshman
seminar
which
included
many
extensive
and
various
papers
but
I
also
had
a
history
class
which
entailed
three
papers
in
length
of
fifteen
to
twenty
pages
and
one
page
every
night
summing
about
one-hundred
pages
of
a
textbook.
One
new
thing
for
me
in
my
first
year
seminar
was
that
we
had
a
fellow
student
read
our
papers
(the
Writing
Associate)
which
both
scared
me
because
I
have
never
let
anyone,
except
my
teacher,
read
my
papers
because
I
was
embarrassed
that
they
were
not
as
good
as
my
classmates-
My
first
meeting
with
my
Writing
Associate
gave
me
a
lot
of
confidence
because
I
had
heard
a
phrase
that
I
had
never
heard
before
about
my
writing,
this
is
one
of
the
best
papers
in
the
class,
there
is
not
a
lot
you
need
to
do."
This
encouragement
continued
with
my
first
year
seminar
teacher
who
encouraged
me
and
helped
me
with
the
fine
details
of
writing.
When
J
received
my
first
assignment
from
my
history
class
I
thought
that
I
should
have
transferred
classes
because
this
would
be
overwhelming.
After
my
initial
shock,
I
thought
that
I
would
attempt
to
go
through
the
same
stages
to
finish
a
research
paper
as
I
did
in
high
school
but
my
biggest
task
was
how
do
I
finish
a
project
in
less
than
two
weeks
which
I
was
used
to
completing
in
one
and
one-half
months*
I
attempted
to
finish
all
the
steps
and
perfect
them
along
the
way
and
I
ended
up
being
able
to
finish
this
paper
using
every
step.
Unfortunately,
when
I
was
assigned
my
second
paper
I
had
a
lot
of
other
work
and
did
not
have
the
-time
to
follow
all
the
steps
intricately
and
this
was
the
first
time
I
learned
how
to
crank
out
a
good
paper
while
under
the
stress
and
time
constraint
that
college
often
brings.
Yet,
I
still
find
that
I
have
a
handicap
when
I
compare
myself
to
others:
it
takes
me
much
longer
to
write
a
good
paper
than
it
does
for
my
peers.
For
example,
I
have
one
friend
who
can
writer
an
A
paper
in
less
than
five
hours
while
it
takes
me
about
five
days.
Although
I
have
to
work
harder,
I
believe
my
finished
project
is
more
fulfilling
for
me
than
her
paper
is
for
her.
Also,
I
believe
that
I
learn
more
by
taking
more
time
to
write
a
good
paper
that
I
am
proud
of.
When
I
wrote
my
earliest
paper
for
my
first
year
writing
class,
I
was
a
little
nervous
because
I
had
done
very
well
in
my
first
year
seminar
and
I
felt
internal
pressure
to
do
as
well.
The
biggest
obstacle
I
had
in
that
class
was
my
struggle
to
do
well
without
receiving
a
grade
to
know
where
I
stood."
This
class
and
teacher
helped
me
a
lot
because
I
taught
myself
that
writing
did
not
have
to
be
purely
for
a
grade.
This
is
what
I
always
believed
to
foe
the
point
before
that
because
I
honestly
did
not
enjoy
any
part
about
writing
before
college
because
most
of
the
topics
I
had
to
write
about
did
not
interest
me
and
the
two
topics
which
did
were
my
research
paper
which
I
viewed
as
a
cruel
joke.
The
newest
type
of
writing
I
encountered
in
college
was
writing
a
laboratory
report
which
was
different
from
any
other
type
of
writing
I
had
done
previously
because
there
were
different
sections
and
I
felt
as
if
my
paper
was
artificially
broken
up*
As
luck
would
have
it,
I
found
out
that
I
had
the
hardest
laboratory
teacher
for
my
first
class
which
I
had
to
write
reports.
Although
I
spent
the
longest
amount
of
time
to
finish
my
papers,
my
finished
product
was
more
coherent
and
psychologically
and
grammatically
correct.
Since
that
class,
I
have
felt
as
If
I
have
had
a
boost
in
my
laboratory
writing
and
this
is
demonstrated
in
the
grades
I
receive
in
these
classes.
Another
class
which
I
wrote
a
lot
in
was
an
independent
study
class
in
psychology
which
I
spent
the
whole
semester
trying
to
produce
one
paper.
This
was
a
unique
experience
for
me
because
I
had
never
spent
so
long
researching
and
writing
on
one
topic
which
I
am
genuinely
interested
in.
I
think
this
was
the
most
rewarding
paper
I
ever
wrote
because
hundreds
of
hours
of
research
and
pondering
and
writing
on
one
subject
turned
into
an
awesome
paper
of
twenty-seven
pages.
I
was
so
proud
and
interested
in
this
paper
that
I
had
to
sometimes
beg
my
friends
to
read
it
and
ask
for
their
comments
on
how
i
could
improve
my
thesis
and
evidence
and
often
their
advice
was
superior
to
what
I
had
thought
of
and
I
added
their
thoughts.
I
honestly
believe
it
was
this
class
which
taught
me
the
best
lesson
about
writing:
other
people's
comments
help
a
lot
and
should
be
asked
for
and
used
constantly.
I
feel
that
my
writing
has
improved
greatly
since
I
first
picked
up
my
number
two
pencil
in
kindergarten.
For
me,
the
most
important
part
of
my
progression
is
the
fact
that
I
have
more
confidence
now
than
I
did
before
because
1
feel
as
if
my
writing
is
worth
something
and
good.
I
hope
that
the
future
will
bring
me
more
confidence
and
my
interest
in
writing
will
increase
because
over
the
last
two
years
I
realize
that
writing
is
something
that
fun
and
interesting
not
tedious
and
boring.
