Journaling
By
1
August
1997
Mrs.
Simonetti
sparks
my
earliest
writing
memory.
I
was
five
years
old
and
in
her
kindergarten
class
cutting
and
pasting
a
purple
snowman
to
hang
in
the
hallway
outside
our
classroom.
When
I
had
perfected
my
artwork,
Mrs.
Simonetti
instructed
me
to
write
my
name
on
the
back
and
hand
it
in
to
be
hung.
I
distinctly
remember
laying
my
precious
snowman
face-down
on
my
tiny
desk
and
signing
my
full
name,
in
cursive,
on
his
back.
I
proudly
admired
my
work
and
brought
it
to
her
to
receive
my
praise.
However,
she
was
furious
because
she
had
not
yet
taught
us
to
write
in
cursive
and
felt
that
my
doing
so
was
inappropriate
for
a
kindergarten
child.
Since
my
mother
had
been
a
kindergarten
teacher
for
years
before
I
was
bom,
she
had
spent
hours
teaching
me
to
sing
my
name
and
we
had
both
been
very
pleased
with
my
progressing
script.
I
tried
in
vain
to
explain
this
to
Mrs.
Simonetti,
who
firmly
told
me
to
put
my
snowman
in
the
garbage
and
start
over
with
another
piece
of
construction
paper.
I
was
crushed
to
learn
that
all
the
purple
paper
was
gone.
Though
my
snowman
seems
relatively
insignificant
to
the
beginning
of
a
writing
career,
I
believe
the
early
start
I
had
with
my
mother
inspired
my
passion
for
reading
and,
of
course,
writing.
By
the
time
I
was
in
fourth
grade,
I
had
become
an
avid
reader
and
had
finished
numerous
series
of
children's
books.
The
stories
and
adventures
about
which
I
read
sparked
my
decision
to
write
my
own
book.
I
can
still
picture
myself
sitting
down
at
my
desk
in
my
bedroom
with
an
open
pile
of
fresh
loose-leaf
paper
and
two
sharpened
pencils
nearby.
I
got
as
far
as
to
create
the
title,
The
Disappearing
Island,
inspired
by
a
Nancy
Drew
book
I
had
just
finished
reading,
before
I
realized
that
writing
a
book
was
not
a
one-day
job.
I
decided
to
wait
a
while
to
write
a
book.
That
same
year
in
school,
I
was
assigned
my
first
real
book
report.
I
was
surprised
to
hear
my
classmates
complain
about
having
to
read
an
entire
book,
while
I
was
having
difficulty
deciding
which
book
to
chose.
I
was
thrilled
at
the
prospect
of
not
only
being
able
to
read
a
book
of
choice
for
school,
but
about
being
allowed
to
summarized
it
and
share
its
meaning
to
me
with
others.
This
first
book
report,
as
well
as
the
many
that
followed,
were
my
first
attempts
at
serious
writing
and
also
the
source
of
many
of
my
primitive
writing
skills.
I
remember
the
sheer
joy
I
felt
when
I
received
an
A
on
that
first
report,
along
with
Mrs.
Cuozzo's
comment,
This
is
first-class
work!
Oak
Hill
Academy,
the
grammar
school
I
attended
from
grades
five
through
eight,
was
extremely
demanding
overall,
but
especially
of
our
writing,
English,
and
grammar
skills.
In
the
four
years
I
attended
the
school,
I
wrote
a
total
of
over
twenty-five
formal
papers,
including
book
reports,
biographies,
autobiographies,
research
papers,
essays,
reviews,
newspaper
articles,
short
stories,
and
even
some
poetry.
Daily
for
four
years
I
was
bombarded
with
grammar
skills
and
exercises
in
Language
Arts
class
and
with
literature
and
writing
assignments
in
English
class.
We
explored
various
forms
of
writing
in
Language
Arts
class
by
pouring
over
our
grammar
textbooks
for
hours
to
learn
the
differences
between
such
forms
as
expository,
persuasive,
argumentative,
and
research
writing
styles.
In
English
class,
we
then
put
this
knowledge
to
work
by
writing
examples
of
each
of
the
aforementioned
styles.
During
the
sixth
grade,
I
had
my
first
experience
with
personal
writing,
as
my
English
teacher
required
us
to
keep
a
daily
journal.
For
approximately
ten
minutes
at
the
start
of
each
class,
we
were
either
given
a
topic
about
which
to
write
or
we
were
permitted
a
free
topic,
to
write
about
whatever
we
chose.
I
was
at
first
wary
of
having
to
write
in
such
a
personal
fashion
and
about
expressing
my
feelings
on
paper
for
my
teacher
to
read,
but
I
soon
found
myself
looking
forward
to
those
ten
minutes
of
silence
when
I
was
alone
in
a
full
classroom
and
able
to
write
freely.
I
could
peacefully
express
myself,
knowing
that
no
one
but
myself
and
my
teacher
would
see
my
thoughts.
I
realized
how
easy
it
was
for
me
to
release
my
inner
thoughts
onto
paper.
My
journal
eventually
become
a
therapeutic
device
in
which
I
could
be
completely
honest
to
myself
about
whatever
was
on
my
mind.
At
the
end
of
the
year
I
was
actually
disappointed
to
put
my
journal
away.
On
the
first
day
of
seventh
grade,
I
met
my
new
English
and
Language
Arts
teacher,
Mrs.
Inglis.
I
feel
that
she,
more
than
any
other
teacher
I
have
ever
had,
taught
me
how
to
write.
To
my
delight,
she
also
required
us
to
keep
a
weekly
journal.
Her
assigned
topics
became
increasingly
interesting
and
thought-provoking
as
the
year
passed.
In
addition
to
the
journals,
she
required
weekly
essays
which
had
to
include
each
of
our
twenty
spelling
words
for
the
week,
bi-weekly
papers
on
whatever
book
we
happened
to
be
reading
at
the
time,
as
well
as
numerous
special
projects.
I
was
overwhelmed
with
writing
and
scrutinized
harshly
by
Mrs.
Inglis,
but
came
out
of
her
class
a
much
better
writer.
Her
forte
was
creative
writing,
and
she
thoroughly
enjoyed
giving
us
the
starting
sentence
to
an
essay
and
allowing
us
to
finish
it
however
we
so
chose.
She
was
the
first
teacher
to
give
me
B
s
on
my
papers,
but
I
respected
her
opinion
so
much
that
I
only
tried
harder
and
eventually
did
receive
a
few
A
s.
She
seemed
to
be
especially
fond
of
my
journal
entries,
which
I
found
great
joy
in
reading
after
the
year
came
to
a
close.
I
found
it
so
easy
to
remember
exactly
what
I
was
thinking
and
feeling
on
the
day
I
wrote
on
each
topic.
I
decided
to
save
both
journals
and
filed
them
away
with
my
other
school
notebooks
at
the
back
of
my
closet.
My
final
grammar
school
year
brought
the
infamous
eighth
grade
term
paper,
known
throughout
the
school
as
the
most
difficult
assignment
given
annually
by
one
of
the
toughest
English
teachers,
Mrs.
Anderson.
During
the
first
week
of
the
second
semester,
she
handed
each
of
us
a
detailed
and
dreaded
description
of
exactly
what
was
expected.
I
nearly
choked
when
I
read
that
the
required
length
was
ten
to
twelve
typed
pages!
The
assignment
was
very
specific
and
complicated.
It
began
with
requiring
each
student
to
locate
ten
sources
on
his
or
her
topic
and
make
numbered
bibliography
cards
for
reference.
We
then
had
to
construct
a
detailed
outline
of
the
entire
paper,
and
create
a
minimum
of
fifty
index
cards
filled
with
the
notes
we
took
from
each
of
the
labeled
sources.
Two
rough
drafts
were
handed
in
as
the
due
date
approached,
each
of
which
was
perused
and
marked
in
bright
red
ink
before
the
final
paper
was
turned
in.
The
entire
process
took
over
two
months
and
was
truly
a
chore,
but
I
can
honestly
say
that
I
knew
how
to
write
an
excellent
term
paper
by
the
time
I
was
thirteen
years
old.
My
strong
English
background
was
a
huge
advantage
in
high
school,
as
I
found
myself
far
better
prepared
for
writing
assignments
than
most
of
my
classmates.
I
remember
retrieving
my
eighth
grade
term
paper
from
its
place
in
my
file
box
numerous
times
as
a
guide
in
writing
other
papers
throughout
high
school.
I
was
disappointed
that
neither
my
freshman
or
sophomore
teachers
required
a
daily
journal,
but
I
did
enjoy
the
summer
reading
journals
which
were
mandatory
for
every
student
in
the
school.
We
were
assigned
increasing
numbers
of
books
to
read
each
summer
and
were
instructed
to
keep
a
journal
for
each
book,
which
included
a
summary
and
personal
analysis
of
each
and
every
chapter.
As
much
as
I
enjoyed
reading
so
many
books,
the
journals
were
difficult
to
keep
up
with.
During
Christmas
vacation
of
my
freshman
year,
I
remember
coming
across
my
old
journals
when
I
was
looking
for
something
at
the
back
of
my
closet.
I
sat
down
on
the
floor
of
my
room
for
hours
and
read
and
reread
my
entries.
It
was
truly
amazing
to
see
how
I
had
grown
and
changed
in
only
two
years.
I
laughed
and
even
cried
as
I
relived
memories
I
had
almost
forgotten.
After
I
had
read
both
notebooks
from
front
to
back,
I
turned
on
my
new
typewriter,
a
Christmas
present,
and
taught
myself
how
to
store
memory
into
it
by
typing
onto
the
small
screen
without
typing
onto
paper.
This
became
my
new
journal
and
I
sat
at
my
desk
and
typed
and
typed
until
I
had
caught
up
on
the
past
two
years
of
my
life.
After
typing
regularly
for
a
few
weeks,
I
decided
that
I
preferred
to
write
to
my
journal
rather
than
type.
One
day,
I
picked
up
my
favorite
pen
and
opened
the
second
marble
notebook
to
the
first
empty
page.
The
words
seemed
to
flow
directly
from
my
mind
to
the
paper.
I
wrote
about
friends,
boyfriends,
my
family,
school,
and
how
I
felt
about
each
as
well
as
anything
and
everything
else
that
came
to
mind.
I
filled
over
ten
pages
without
remembering
turning
the
first
page.
When
I
had
finished,
I
realized
how
calm
and
relaxed
I
felt.
I
promised
myself
I
would
take
time
as
often
as
possible
to
write
to
my
journal
not
only
to
clear
my
head
and
relax,
but
to
capture
my
memories
to
someday
read
and
reminisce.
Throughout
high
school,
as
life
became
increasingly
more
complicated,
I
often
removed
my
journal
from
its
hiding
place
under
my
mattress
and
curled
up
in
bed
to
write.
Soon,
the
plain
marble
notebook
became
an
old
friend
and
my
entries
deep
conversations
which
I
couldn't
hold
with
anyone.
As
much
as
I
enjoyed
writing,
I
grew
even
more
fond
of
rereading
old
entries
and
noting
the
differences
in
my
attitudes,
values,
and
even
in
my
handwriting.
As
I
grew
older
and
increasingly
more
involved
in
school
and
social
affairs,
my
time
for
journaling
dwindled.
Months
would
pass
between
entries
rather
than
only
weeks.
I
found
it
hard
to
make
time
to
write
for
enjoyment
because
I
was
so
busy
with
school
writing
assignments.
My
junior
and
senior
years
of
high
school
were
replete
with
writing
assignments.
My
English
teacher
of
both
years
made
me
happy
by
using
slightly
less
frequent
journaling
exercises
a
few
times
a
week
and
seemed
especially
pleased
with
my
responses
to
the
controversial
topics
on
which
she
asked
that
we
write.
I
enjoyed
expressing
my
opinion
on
her
topics
but
had
grown
very
accustomed
to
beginning
an
entry
with
,"Dear
Journal,"
and
then
writing
about
myself
and
my
life
without
being
criticized
or
graded
on
my
thoughts.
Perhaps
because
I
had
less
and
less
time
for
my
journal,
I
would
instead
take
some
time
late
at
night
when
my
house
was
finally
quiet
and
to
open
another
notebook,
designated
as
my
poetry
and
quote
book.
Its
pages
are
filled
with
numerous
poems
I
first
started
writing
in
grammar
school
as
class
assignments
and
continued
into
high
school.
Since
I
found
it
easier
and
quicker
to
jot
down
a
few
lines
of
poetry
than
complete
an
entire
journal
entry,
I
often
took
out
the
notebook,
especially
when
I
was
upset,
and
expressed
myself
in
rhyme
and
rhythm.
My
poems
are
nothing
to
publish,
but
each
one
tells
a
specific
story
about
something
in
my
life
which
made
me
extremely
happy
or
upset.
I
also
keep
a
section
reserved
for
quotes
I've
heard
over
the
years
which
mean
something
to
me
or
which
express
the
way
I
feel
about
certain
things.
It's
been
quite
some
time
since
I've
picked
up
either
notebook.
After
graduating
from
high
school
with
an
award
in
English
and
Literature,
I
stopped
keeping
a
journal
and
writing
poetry.
I
can
attribute
the
reason
for
the
pause
to
simply
being
too
busy.
However,
I
have
thought
about
writing
in
my
journal
again
but
always
decide
against
it
because
I
think
I
would
just
have
too
much
about
which
to
write.
Years
ago,
I
could
pick
up
a
pen
and
summarize
my
entire
week
in
a
page
or
two.
Today,
I
feel
that
my
life
is
so
complicated
and
so
full
that
I
wouldn't
know
where
to
begin
writing.
Perhaps
someday
I'll
buy
a
new
marble
notebook
and
curl
up
in
bed
on
a
winter
night
to
have
a
deep
conversation
the
way
I
used
to
when
things
were
simpler.
I
think
that
my
long
history
of
writing
experiences
has
shaped
my
skills
into
what
they
are
today.
I
was
definitely
well
prepared
in
grammar
school
for
high
school
writing
assignments
due
to
the
extensive
English
program
I
endured.
High
school
advanced
all
I
learned
at
Oak
Hill
by
forcing
me
to
use
the
skills
I
had
learned.
But
I
think
that
the
most
important,
and
definitely
the
most
enjoyable
writing
experience
I've
had
is
my
journal.
I
know
that
I
have
grown
as
a
writer
because
I
have
learned
over
the
years
to
express
myself
honestly
on
paper.
I
have
used
this
knowledge
in
all
my
writing
assignments,
in
which
I
always
find
a
little
piece
of
myself
after
editing.
I
knew
I
was
prepared
as
a
writer
for
the
experiences
I
would
have
with
college
writing,
and
I
was
therefore
not
nervous
about
writing
in
college.
As
I
expected,
my
first
year
seminar
was
not
extremely
difficult
and
I
did
very
well.
Second
semester
of
freshmen
year
proved
much
more
challenging
because
I
placed
out
of
the
first
year
writing
class
and
opted
to
take
Literary
Questions.
Though
the
class
proved
to
be
very
challenging,
I
also
fared
well.
I
finally
felt
truly
challenged
in
college
and
found
that
I
had
to
spend
more
than
twice
the
amount
of
time
on
papers
than
I
did
in
high
school.
I
have
spent
thousands
of
hours
writing
over
the
course
of
the
past
ten
years
and
can
honestly
say
I
have
enjoyed
every
moment.
