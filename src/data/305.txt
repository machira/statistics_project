The
Writing
Years:
My
History
as
a
Writer
from
Elementary
School
to
College
August
2001
It
all
began
on
a
damp,
dreary
day
at
the
height
of
autumn's
reign
in
1987.
My
father
had
been
working
in
the
garage
since
the
early
morning
hours
while
the
rest
of
my
family,
my
mother
and
two
sisters,
ran
errands
in
various
malls
throughout
the
county.
That
left
me
alone
in
the
house,
independently
entertaining
and
amusing
myself
as
uniquely
as
I
saw
fit.
I
remember
the
day
so
clearly,
because
it
was
on
this
day
that
I
created
what
I
then
thought
of
as
my
first
written
masterpiece.
Entitled
Harry
and
His
Store,
the
6
page
book
told
the
story,
complete
with
colorful
illustrations,
of
faithful
store
owner
Harry
who
is
visited
one
day
by
a
cowboy
whom
Harry
immediately
and
wrongfully
assumes
is
a
robber.
Fortunately,
Harry
soon
realizes
the
error
of
his
suspicions;
the
cowboy
is
simply
another
lonely
soul
searching
for
kindness.
The
two
quickly
become
friends
and
the
brief
book
concludes
happily
and
predictably.
Simple,
short,
anticipatable
and
completely
lacking
in
substance,
Harry
and
His
Store
was
ultimately
given
to
my
elementary
school's
library.
It
was
a
nice
addition
to
the
library's
small
section
of
other
children's
work.
I
later
proudly
noted
that
my
book
was
checked
out
by
numerous
students
throughout
my
elementary
school
career.
I
had
accomplished
what
I
set
out
to
do;
I
had
created
something
for
others
to
enjoy,
and
my
favorite
part
(as
a
six
year
old)
was
that
I
had
done
so
completely
on
my
own
and
of
my
own
volition.
Years
after,
I
would
realize
that
this
last
statement
was
not
entirely
true.
I
would
recall
running
outside
to
our
garage
every
few
minutes
to
ask
my
father
(the
high
school
English
teacher
and
my
earliest
mentor)
one
question
or
another
concerning
spelling
and
plot
ideas.
So,
it
appears
that
even
then,
in
the
very
beginning
of
my
writing
escapades,
I
sought
help
from
outside
sources,
and
doubly
realized
the
importance
of
editors
for
my
work
as
well
as
the
difficulty
in
creating
a
masterpiece
solely
on
one's
own.
In
the
years
that
followed
this
primitive
excursion
into
the
writing
world,
I
experimented
with
several
different
genres
of
both
reading
and
composition.
During
the
winter
of
second
grade,
my
mother
convinced
me
to
begin,
and
consistently
keep,
a
daily
journal
in
which
I
could
record
all
my
initially
underdeveloped
and
eventually
developed
thoughts
and
feelings
concerning
each
day's
events.
Sometimes
entries
were
simple
and
lacking
in
detail,
while
still
others
droned
on
for
pages
about
the
problematic
social
hurdles
and
exaggerated
academic
difficulties
in
the
life
of
a
youth.
I
filled
eight
journals
in
three
and
a
half
years.
Looking
back
at
these
entries
now,
it
is
obvious
that
the
quality
of
the
writing
increased
with
the
passage
of
time,
but
unfortunately,
through
the
course
of
daily
monotony,
no
groundbreaking
discoveries
or
life-altering
concepts
were
produced.
The
writing
remained
stagnant,
and
inevitably,
I
tired
of
such
boring
routine.
Little
by
little,
I
wrote
less
and
less
until
finally,
I
stopped
altogether.
Of
course,
I
was
still
very
young.
The
real
writing,
the
serious
attempts
at
passion
and
the
joking
attempts
at
comedy,
would
arrive
much
later.
In
the
meantime,
the
stories
I
wrote
in
school
for
assignments
consisted
of
barely-there
plots
I
could
never
quite
pull
together.
I
remember
one
story
in
particular
from
when
I
was
in
fourth
or
fifth
grade.
It
was
written
in
the
black
and
white
composition
notebooks
we
were
always
required
to
use
for
class.
My
penmanship
was
appalling,
but
the
story
itself
was
even
worse.
The
plot,
somewhat
autobiographical
and
from
the
perspective
of
a
nine
year
old,
focused
on
the
birthday
party
of
a
young
girl;
it
detailed
the
attending
guests
(all
girls,
of
course)
and
their
gifts.
Instead
of
concentrating
on
subject
matter
or
character
development,
I
chose
to
dedicate
my
creative
energy
to
the
choosing
of
character
names
and
the
details
of
their
clothing
and
appearances.
The
juvenility
involved
was
so
obvious
that
I
could
already
notice
it
when
I
reread
the
story
a
few
years
later
in
middle
school.
Hand
in
hand
with
this
problem,
naturally
fixable
by
age
maturation,
was
another,
more
inherent
flaw
in
my
writing;
I
could
not
end
a
story.
All
through
middle
school,
I
was
plagued
by
this
dilemma.
Any
work
of
fiction
I
created
completely
on
my
own
could
never
be
granted
an
ending
suitable
to
the
entire
first
part
of
the
story.
I
had
a
habit
of
building
up
details,
most
of
them
unnecessary,
to
the
point
of
no
possible
feasible
conclusion.
Plots
started
well,
but
they
never
finished,
and
the
piece
of
writing
just
trailed
off...
Hoping
to
escape
the
problem
of
appropriate
endings,
I
explored
the
outlet
of
more
abstractly
creative
writing
like
poetry.
There,
I
quickly
found,
endings
were
not
necessary
and,
more
often
than
not,
were
not
even
advantageous.
A
poem
did
not
need
a
beginning,
middle
and
end,
and
it
certainly
did
not
have
to
make
sense.
In
seventh
grade,
the
outlet
of
poetry
did
wonders
to
improve
my
confidence
as
a
writer.
I
wrote
poems,
one
of
which
was
even
published.
By
the
time
high
school
rolled
around,
I
had
gained
enough
self-assurance
to
know
that
English
would
always
be
my
best
subject
in
education.
Book
reports
became
more
analytical
and
original;
I
no
longer
merely
reported
on
the
material
but
now
I
drew
conclusions
from
my
readings
as
well.
However,
it
was
not
until
my
junior
year
that
I
worked
with
a
teacher
who
would
forever
alter
and
assist
my
writing
career.
The
first
paper
I
wrote
for
11th
grade
Honors
English
was
a
summer
assignment
to
compare
and
contrast
The
Grapes
of
Wrath
with
Blue
Highways.
The
essay
emerges
as
a
particularly
memorable
experience
for
me
because
it
marked
my
first
B
on
a
paper.
Up
until
that
point,
I
had
not
received
anything
less
than
a
90
on
an
assignment,
and
my
ego
took
quite
the
blow.
A
more
healthy
writing
occurrence
I
cannot
recall,
for
it
was
at
this
stage
in
my
life
that
I
truly
realized
the
importance
associated
with
revision.
I
immediately
scheduled
a
meeting
with
my
English
teacher,
Mr.
Nugent,
and
we
examined
my
paper
phrase
by
phrase
while
discussing
ways
for
its
improvement.
"Writing
is
no
longer
a
pleasure
cruise,"
my
teacher
advised.
"In
this
class,
I
expect
you
to
turn
the
heat
up
a
few
notches
and
take
everything
to
the
next
levelVincent
Nugent
was,
I
firmly
avow,
a
very
wise
man.
The
Grapes
of
Wrath/Highways
paper
marked
my
first
encounter
with
reality
in
the
literary
world,
and
it
was
not
to
be
my
last.
Although
I
was
not
to
truly
struggle
until
later
years,
I
did
undergo
several
difficulties
in
Mr.
Nugent's
11th
grade,
and
then
12th
grade
AP
class.
At
one
point
in
the
year,
our
class
was
assigned
the
task
of
writing
my
old
nemesis,
an
original
short
story.
By
this
time,
I
had
grown
accustomed
to
meeting
with
my
teacher
to
go
over
first
drafts
I
was
not
quite
satisfied
with.
Previously,
I
would
merely
type
up
a
paper
on
the
computer
the
night
before
its
due
date
and
then
turn
it
in;
there
were
no
first
drafts,
peer
editing
or
reconstructive
techniques.
But
because
of
the
Grapes
of
Wrath/Highways
experience,
I
could
finally
list
revision
as
my
most
beneficial
ally.
Another
person's
perspective,
especially
that
of
the
teacher
involved,
I
soon
learned,
could
be
used
as
a
valuable
resource.
My
next
lesson
concerned
the
art
of
freewriting.
AP
English
employed
a
more
laid
back
atmosphere
that
stressed
sentence
diagramming,
as
well
as
various
types
of
writing,
including
descriptive,
argumentative,
persuasive,
poetic
and
narrative.
There
was
a
unit
for
each
writing
type
where
students
read
a
sample
and
then
wrote
their
own
piece,
to
be
read
in
class
the
next
day,
answering
a
certain
question.
Not
only
did
this
enable
me
to
explore
more
techniques
than
simple
analysis
of
literature,
but
it
also
allowed
for
a
high
degree
of
peer
feedback.
When
a
student
read
his/her
piece
in
class,
there
followed
a
period
of
criticism
and
examination
where
everyone
was
required
to
offer
suggestions
and/or
compliments.
This
was
a
more
informal
method
of
editing
and
reconstruction
than
I
was
used
to,
yet
I
still
prospered
from
it.
It
helped
to
discover
that
others
struggled
with
the
same
problems
for
different
assignments
that
I
struggled
with,
while
it
was
also
a
comfort
to
know
that
I
could
assist
others
with
certain
situations
in
which
I
had
succeeded.
Overall,
this
"round
table"
sort
of
discussion
broke
the
ice
for
many
of
my
fears
regarding
peer
readings
of
my
writing,
a
prominent
phobia
I
then
harbored.
Thanks
to
the
efforts
of
my
classmates
and
my
teacher,
by
the
end
of
my
senior
year
in
high
school
I
was
finally
able
to
appreciate
my
writing
for
the
hard
work
I
put
into
it,
not
just
for
the
grade
it
received.
This
work
usually
paid
off,
sometimes
even
literally.
My
most
rewarding
writing
experience
arrived
close
to
the
end
of
my
senior
year.
A
part
of
AP
English's
requirements
was
to
write
and
submit
an
analytical
essay
remarking
upon
Ayn
Rand's
controversial
masterpiece,
The
Fountainhead,
to
the
annual
contest
created
by
the
Ayn
Rand
Institute.
In
this
case,
the
work
submitted
was
to
be
entirely
individual
and
void
of
any
other
person's
help
or
criticism.
I
had
worked
all
year
to
reach
this
point
of
relying
completely
on
myself
and
my
past
experiences.
Dedicating
nearly
a
week
straight
of
daily
labor,
I
at
length
emerged
with
a
paper
I
felt
worthy
of
the
Institute's
review.
Apparently,
the
contest
board
shared
my
sentiments,
because
it
awarded
me
a
third
prize
of
$1000.
Fueled
by
my
newfound
literary
confidence,
I
elected
the
course
entitled
"The
Economic
Philosophy
of
Ayn
Rand"
as
my
first
choice
for
a
first
year
seminar
at
Lafayette.
In
freshman
orientation,
they
explained
to
us
that
each
FYS
and
most
writing
courses
had
peer
evaluators
termed
"Writing
Associates,"
or
WAs
for
short.
A
WA
seemed
like
an
intriguing
idea
to
me,
because,
although
I
was
used
to
peer
evaluations
and
heavy
revision
work,
I
was
not
used
to
it
on
such
an
obviously
formal,
strict
basis.
Also,
I
had
trouble
with
the
title
of
WA
itself
because
I
had
only
recently
discovered
Wawa,
a
store
common
in
Pennsylvania
and
New
Jersey
but
non-existent
in
my
native
New
York,
and
I
feared
I
would
somehow
blunderingly
confuse
the
two.
However,
I
quickly
came
to
believe
that
the
WA
idea
is
an
incredible
benefit
to
college
writers
and
I
only
wish
that
students
from
other
colleges
could
be
awarded
the
same
profitable
opportunities.
My
FYS
did
not
provide
any
mind-breaking
conclusions,
but
it
did
offer
a
breath
of
fresh
air
in
a
field
I
thought
I
had
already
sufficiently
covered.
Rather
than
focusing
mainly
on
Ayn
Rand's
works
and
ideas,
we
investigated
such
concepts
and
their
weight
in
the
world
today.
It
was
a
chiefly
philosophical
and
economic
course,
and
one
my
scanty
background
of
such
subjects
did
little
to
prepare
me
for.
Even
though
we
were
only
assigned
three
papers,
two
of
which
had
almost
nothing
to
do
with
Rand,
throughout
the
course
of
the
semester,
I
found
myself
agonizing
over
each
one.
Perhaps
it
was
mere
nervousness
at
my
first
official
"college"
writing
assignment,
but
I
found
much
of
my
previous
self-assurance
dissipated.
Enter
Gina,
my
FYS
WA.
To
my
delight,
she
not
only
had
taken
previous
courses
with
our
FYS
professor,
but
she
was
also
majoring
in
business
and
economics,
both
of
which
were
heavily
covered
in
the
current
curriculum.
Gina
offered
grammar
and
editing
help
with
my
papers,
along
with
her
knowledge
of
the
chief
economic
ideas
lurking
behind
the
assignments.
Her
expertise
and
insight
shaded
in
some
of
the
more
blank
questions
I
had
that
were
left
over
from
class
topics.
Of
course,
I
still
lacked
much
of
the
philosophical
enlightenment,
and
it
was
true:
for
me,
writing
had,
once
again,
been
taken
to
"the
next
level."
As
a
result
of
my
WA
meetings,
as
well
as
the
former
evaluative
editing
techniques,
I
came
to
view
writing
as
the
process
it
has
to
be.
After
my
FYS
experience,
my
College
Writing
class
utilized
the
idea
of
peer
evaluations
for
every
first
draft
of
a
paper.
This
brought
back
some
of
the
old
anxiety,
but
I
still
felt
much
better
prepared
than
I
had
the
first
day
of
AP
English
in
high
school.
Meeting
with
a
stranger
for
half
an
hour
to
discuss
and
improve
a
paper
definitely
strengthened
my
self-faith
as
a
writer.
I
also
found,
in
ensuing
English
courses
at
Lafayette,
the
assistance
associated
with
visiting
a
professor.
This
one-on-one
method
enabled
me
to
grasp
ideas
from
class
that
I
had
not
previously
understood,
and
it
let
me
know
if
I
was
on
the
right
track
to
the
desired
paper
or
if
I
was
merely
floundering
helplessly
in
circles.
Sometimes,
I
did
not
have
time
to
schedule
a
professor-student
meeting
about
a
paper
whose
philosophies
I
was
still
shaky
on
before
the
paper's
due
date.
In
some
of
these
instances,
I
was
granted
fortunate
permission
for
a
rewrite,
after
discussing
the
problems
in
what
I
originally
submitted.
This
helped
tremendously,
and
in
a
few
cases
I
was
even
able
to
improve
my
grade
by
a
whole
letter.
The
writing
process
cannot
be
just
one
jump
through
on
the
computer;
it
takes
time
and
effort
to
achieve
success,
along
with
the
evaluative
guidance
of
other
knowledgeable
sources.
I
used
to
write
a
paper
the
night
before
it
was
due,
then
hand
it
in
without
even
reading
my
words!
Using
WAs,
peer
editors,
and
professors
as
drafting
and
evaluating
assistants
has
not
only
alleviated
some
of
my
embarrassment
related
to
how
my
written
work
is
received
but
also
enhanced
the
overall
quality
of
my
work.
It
took
me
years
to
reach
this
stage
in
my
writing
career.
Harry
and
His
Store
and
the
Grapes
of
Wrath/Highways
paper,
though
long
ago
in
my
past,
still
loom
as
evidence
of
my
deficiencies
as
a
writer
and
my
need
for
outside
help.
Since
every
piece
of
work
can
be
improved,
I
no
longer
feel
comfortable
with
its
submission
until
it
has
been
reviewed
by
someone
whose
opinion
I
hold
in
high
esteem.
Computer
spell
checks
and
thesauruses
are
useful
tools
that
I
admittedly
could
not
survive
without;
however,
it
would
appear
that
the
knowledge
and
experiences
of
other
writers
remain
just
as
helpful
in
assisting
the
writing
path.
Sometimes
a
sentence,
though
it
makes
sense
to
me
as
the
writer,
will
not
always
be
understood
and
accepted
by
an
outside
source.
It
is
the
uninformed
reader
who
truly
has
the
final
say
in
determining
a
paper's
accuracy
and
intelligibility.
With
my
own
writing
experiences
behind
me,
I
hope
to
assist
others
with
some
of
the
same
problems
I
encountered
(and
still
encounter!)
The
need
for
evaluations
and
criticism
turn
every
piece
of
writing
into
a
series
of
drafts
that
so
concretely
demonstrate
a
writer's
improvement
that
he/she
is
taught
the
priceless
lesson
of
mistakes
not
to
be
repeated.
Writing
is,
without
doubt
or
debate,
a
process
in
which
exterior
help
is
often
appreciated.
