Final
Draft
A
Journey
Through
My
Idea
of
Language
Me
as
Bilbo
Baggins???
My
favorite
book
when
I
was
young
was
The
Hobbit.
This
book
took
me
on
a
faraway
journey
through
a
charade
of
fantasy
lands
with
dwarves,
fairies,
and
hidden
treasure.
The
main
character,
Bilbo
Baggins,
unexpectedly
must
become
a
brave
and
wise
traveler
on
a
journey
through
exotic
lands
with
even
more
exotic
creatures.
Although
Baggins
has
been
a
homebody
all
his
life
thus
far,
he
returns
wiser
and
unafraid
of
the
unknown.
I
continue
to
read
this
story
even
today,
when
I
want
to
transform
into
Bilbo
Baggins
and
travel
to
lands
that
I've
never
visited
before
and
meet
interesting
people
along
the
way.
This
was
one
of
the
few
books
that
I've
ever
read
that
has
contained
a
character
whom
related
to
my
life
in
such
a
profound
way.
I
wanted
to
become
a
traveler
just
like
Baggins,
to
become
wiser,
and
to
see
everything.
I
thought
that
any
place
with
different
people
was
more
interesting
to
me
than
where
I
was
at
that
point
in
my
life.
Although
I
was
young
and
hadn't
see
much
of
the
world,
I
had
a
desire
to
become
well-traveled.
There
are
thousands
of
different
places
in
the
world,
each
with
a
distinct
language,
spoken
by
foreign
people.
By
traveling
and
seeing
these
places,
my
views
and
ideas
about
the
world
would
change
forever.
The
possibilities
that
the
world
held
for
me
were
endless.
If
I
wanted
to,
I
could
live
and
communicate
in
a
different
society
from
my
own.
Communication
was
the
key
to
the
gate
that
beheld
a
multitude
of
opportunities.
The
Olympics
One
of
my
first
memories
that
I
have
of
hearing
another
language
was
when
I
was
watching
TV
when
I
was
a
kid.
As
a
family,
we
were
always
watching
the
Olympics
together.
I
remember
hearing
the
commentators
interview
the
athletes
after
their
performances.
Most
of
the
athletes
that
would
speak
in
their
native
tongues
with
the
exception
of
a
few
that
were
able
to
speak
English.
Usually,
I
could
hear
the
beginning
of
the
interview
in
the
foreign
language
before
the
translator
would
begin.
The
sounds
made
no
sense
to
me
at
all,
but
somehow
the
translator
was
able
to
make
sense
out
of
all
of
the
garbled
noises
that
I
heard
and
translate
it
into
words
that
I
could
understand.
There
were
so
many
different
athletes
from
a
multitude
of
different
countries
that
spoke
languages
that
sounded
completely
different,
yet
from
the
translations
I
could
understand
that
they
were
basically
talking
about
the
same
things.
I
remember
learning
about
these
countries
and
their
official
languages,
but
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
understand
how
to
make
any
connection
with
the
people
who
live
there
if
it
was
not
possible
for
me
to
understand
their
form
of
communication.
Saussere's
Word
Association
Theory
Last
year,
in
a
course
at
Lafayette
called
"Contemporary
Fiction",
I
read
a
book
by
Paul
Auster,
City
of
Glass,
that
influenced
the
way
that
I
think
about
language.
The
book
addressed
the
fact
that
all
languages
of
today
are
not
perfect
because
they
do
not
embody
and
truly
signify
the
true
meaning
of
an
object.
The
perfect
language,
called
the
Adamic
language,
was
lost
when
the
fall
of
mankind
occurred
during
the
biblical
times.
Ever
since
then
it
has
been
impossible
for
a
language
to
be
completely
perfect.
The
point
of
this
book
was
to
reiterate
the
fact
that
language
is
arbitrary.
Words
are
randomly
assigned
to
objects.
It
always
fascinated
me
that
another
person
could
associate
a
completely
different
sound
or
word
with
a
universal
object
when
I
only
know
how
to
identify
it
with
the
word
or
sound
that
I
know.
Ferdinand
de
Saussere,
a
swiss
liguist,
developed
the
theory
that
a
sign
is
a
physical
object
with
meaning
which
consists
of
a
signifier
and
signified.
The
signifier
is
the
image
as
we
perceive
it
while
the
signified
is
the
mental
image
to
which
it
refers.
Languages
use
different
"signs"
to
describe
the
same
signifier
and
signified.
For
example,
during
the
translations
of
the
Olympic
athletes,
there
were
a
few
words
that
all
of
the
interviews
had
in
common
such
as
"good"
or
"my
performance".
But
all
of
the
sounds
and
words
that
the
different
athletes
used
to
express
those
common
words
such
as
"good"
or
"performance"
were
all
different
from
one
another.
The
correlation
between
the
sounds
and
the
objects
is
completely
different.
People
all
over
the
world
are
using
and
thinking
about
the
same
ideas
and
concepts,
but
they
are
all
expressing
them
in
a
completely
different
way.
The
thoughts
that
are
connected
to
the
words
can
be
expressed
in
a
thousand
different
ways.
The
idea
of
this
was
so
fascinating
to
me.
Was
it
possible
for
me
to
think
of
an
object
and
express
it
in
a
different
way
than
I
normally
would?
Or
would
I
always
be
translating
from
English?
I
wonder
at
what
point
does
the
change
occur.
Senora
Garcia
"My
name
is
Sra.
Garcia.
I
am
Hispanic.
I
have
recently
arrived
here
to
the
US
from
Cuba.
My
husband
and
I
were
forced
to
leave
due
to
his
work
in
the
government.
I
am
making
a
new
life
for
my
family
here
in
the
US.
I
am
a
high
school
Spanish
teacher.
I
bring
my
culture
and
knowledge
to
the
classes
that
I
teach.
I
am
a
tough
teacher.
I
have
high
expectations.
Language
takes
work
inside
and
outside
of
the
classroom.
My
students
work
hard
and
many
have
a
genuine
interest
in
learning
the
ability
to
speak
espanol"
(Sra.
Garcia).
I
was
a
sophmore
in
high
school
when
I
first
was
in
Sra
Garcia's
class.
When
I
studied
under
the
tutelage
of
Sra.
Garcia,
my
Spanish
improved
by
leaps
and
bounds.
She
gave
tons
of
homework
and
led
a
strict
classroom,
which
caused
a
lot
of
students
to
dislike
her.
But
what
she
had,
so
many
other
teachers
of
language
didn't.
She
made
you
learn.
We
worked
on
all
aspects
of
the
language
including
grammar,
spelling,
pronunciation,
reading,
writing,
ect.
She
was
able
to
make
it
fun
sometimes
when
we
read
stories
like
Don
Quixote
or
about
bullfights.
Like
so
many
other
language
teachers,
an
important
thing
that
she
stressed
was
learning
outside
of
the
classroom.
She
had
a
slew
of
amusing
phrases,
one
of
which
being
"I
take
you
to
the
water,
now
you
go
home
and
drink
more."
She
wanted
us
to
consistently
use
the
language
and
be
thinking
about
it.
One
of
my
strongest
points
today
in
the
Spanish
language
is
my
ability
to
use
basic
grammar
correctly.
And
I
owe
this
knowledge
to
Sra.
Garcia.
She
gave
me
the
basis
for
the
language
that
has
gotten
me
as
far
as
I've
come
today.
Para
el
futuro,
no
estoy
seguro...
(for
the
future,
I
am
not
sure)
My
ideas
about
the
world
and
the
people
living
in
it
have
changed
since
I
was
young.
No
longer
does
it
seem
so
inaccessible.
Last
semester
I
studied
abroad
and
was
able
to
live
in
a
whole
new
culture
with
people
very
different
from
myself.
The
experience
was
invaluable
to
me.
The
amount
that
I
was
able
to
learn
just
by
living
and
listening
to
another
culture
was
so
much
more
rewarding
than
sitting
in
a
classroom.
I
found
things
out
about
language
and
culture
that
I
never
would've
been
able
to
learn
in
a
classroom.
There
is
more
to
language
than
the
actual
technical
words
and
formations.
For
the
most
part,
expressions
that
we
use
in
English
don't
even
exist
in
other
languages.
There
are
even
different
ways
of
expressing
emotions
in
other
languages.
For
example,
the
Dutch
people
are
very
reserved,
friendly,
but
reserved.
Everywhere
I
went
I
was
not
greeted
with
the
same
friendly
American
service.
There
was
no
such
thing
as
"service
with
a
smile."
This
took
some
getting
used
to
because
many
times
I
was
forced
to
try
and
figure
out
exactly
what
the
Dutch
were
implying
mainly
by
simple
statements.
For
example,
the
word
"alsjeblieft"
has
two
meanings.
It
can
signify
either
"your
welcome"
or
in
the
context
if
someone
is
giving
you
something,
like
"here,
have
this".
It
was
confusing
at
first
but
it
taught
me
that
their
language
has
considerably
less
words
than
English
does.
Many
of
their
words
have
dual
meanings
so
instead
of
just
hearing
and
understanding
words
for
what
they
mean,
one
has
to
pay
attention
to
the
context
that
they're
spoken
in.
Their
faces
were
almost
stone-like
and
the
way
that
they
communicated
in
English
offered
no
clues
about
their
personality
or
intentions
because
they
spoke
very
monotone.
I
was
learning
how
to
understand
their
culture
and
ways
of
communication.
Still
I
am
unsure
of
how
to
read
these
people,
but
at
least
I
learned
that
a
major
difference
in
communication
was
a
quality
of
their
language,
but
not
ours.
I
firmly
believe
now
that
the
only
way
to
learn
to
communicate
correctly
and
in
accordance
with
a
culture
is
by
immersing
yourself
in
that
culture.
There
are
thousands
of
idiosyncrasies
that
they
never
teach
you
in
school.
There
fore,
in
my
quest
to
become
fluent
in
Spanish,
I
have
decided
to
study
there
this
summer
for
two
months.
I've
reached
a
point
where
this
is
the
next
most
logical
step
for
me.
I
am
excited
yet
apprehensive
to
be
living
in
such
a
new
environment.
I
studied
abroad
before
in
the
Netherlands,
where
English
is
widely
spoken.
But
now,
in
Spain,
Spanish
will
be
widely
spoken
and
that's
it.
I
will
live
with
a
family
and
learn
to
follow
their
customs.
They
will
not
speak
any
English,
and
my
only
form
of
communication
will
be
Spanish.
I
will
be
forced
to
speak
and
think
in
Spanish.
I
often
wonder
how
long
the
time
period
of
change
in
thinking
takes
for
a
person.
I
don't
think
that
two
months
is
quite
long
enough,
but
maybe
on
a
small
scale
it
is.
My
normal
everyday
communication
will
be
changed
and
I'll
be
out
of
my
comfort
zone.
In
which
case,
I'll
have
to
adapt
myself
to
a
new
comfort
zone.
Constantly
removing
oneself
from
a
comfort
zone
and
then
back
into
a
comfort
zone
is
beneficial
to
many
aspects
of
life.
I
want
to
become
easily
adaptable.
I
think
that
the
rewards
will
translate
into
my
life
anywhere.
For
example,
when
I
get
out
of
college
and
move
into
the
real
world
and
get
a
job
I
want
to
welcome
the
change
and
adjust
quickly.
My
hopes
for
the
future
include
becoming
bilingual,
fluently
bilingual.
And
I
want
to
use
the
language
in
a
job
where
hopefully
I'll
be
able
to
travel...like
Baggins
to
new
and
exciting
places.
La
lengua
habia
cambiado
a
mi
vida
y
continuara
hacerlo.
