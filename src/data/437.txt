History
When
I
was
about
four
or
five
years
old,
I
had
a
little
pink
book
with
lined
paper.
I
remember
sitting
on
the
floor
at
a
blanket
chest
in
my
bedroom,
pretending
to
write
in
cursive
in
it.
I
saw
my
brother
and
sister
writing
and
I
tried
to
make
the
same
shapes
that
they
did.
I
found
that
book
a
few
years
ago
and
was
surprised
to
see
among
the
scribbles
a
few
actual
cursive
letters.
I
have
always
had
an
interest
in
the
written
word
D
I
remember
sitting
in
church
before
I
could
read,
making
up
lyrics
for
the
hymns
that
I
was
trying
to
read
in
the
hymnal.
Learning
to
read
and
write
was
an
exciting
time
for
me,
and
I
remember
being
fascinated
by
the
fact
that
the
word
NknowO
was
not
pronounced
Ncanoe.O
WeOd
have
spelling
tests
every
week
and
weOd
use
green
paper
with
the
dotted
lines
in
between
the
solid
lines
and
thick
blue
pencils.
The
words
would
be
written
on
a
large
paper
hanging
at
the
front
of
the
room
for
the
week.
I
wasnOt
all
that
great
at
spelling
though,
my
brother
made
fun
of
me
for
years
for
spelling
NfrogO
as
NfirgO
when
I
was
in
first
grade.
I
remember
a
teacher
telling
us
that
if
letter
hung
below
the
solid
line,
the
alligators
would
bite
them
off,
and
if
the
letter
protruded
over
the
top
solid
line,
birds
would
bite
them.
I
tried
to
print
neatly,
but
I
never
got
adept
at
cursive.
By
the
age
of
seven
or
eight,
I
would
write
short
stories
about
puppies
and
little
girls
on
my
dadOs
Apple
2C.
These
would
usually
run
about
a
page
or
two
single
spaced,
and
I
would
always
show
my
mother
what
I
had
written.
I
did
not
take
well
to
criticism.
It
seemed
I
always
had
a
story
going,
in
whatever
blank
notebook
I
could
find,
although
most
of
them
were
never
finished.
I
also
wrote
some
poetry,
and
in
fourth
grade
I
submitted
a
poem
to
a
New
Jersey
contest
and
got
published
in
an
edition
of
poems
whose
sole
purpose
was
to
publish
the
poetry
of
school
children
so
that
their
parents
would
buy
the
book.
I
enjoyed
using
my
dadOs
old
typewriter
whenever
I
could,
and
just
getting
my
hands
on
it
would
inspire
me
to
write.
By
the
age
of
nine
or
ten
I
had
the
idea
for
a
novel
about
a
black
boy
named
Bryon
who
lived
in
an
all-white
neighborhood.
I
wrote
it
in
a
spiral-bound
notebook,
and
completed
several
chapters.
I
would
read
these
chapters
to
my
mom,
and
she
would
tell
me
how
I
have
a
NgiftO
for
writing.
I
would
intermittently
write
the
story,
and
I
think
I
stopped
writing
it
because
one
day
I
read
through
it
again
(this
was
after
I
had
been
writing
it
for
a
couple
years)
and
realized
how
immature
the
style
was,
got
frustrated
with
myself,
and
gave
up.
I
would
also
keep
various
diaries,
and
I
would
keep
them
up
for
a
good
month
or
so
before
losing
interest
for
a
year
or
more,
then
IOd
pick
them
back
up
again.
It
wasnOt
until
I
reached
high
school
that
I
was
able
to
keep
myself
on
track
and
write
frequently
and
actually
fill
a
whole
journal.
I
kept
a
detailed
journal
of
my
familyOs
camping
trip
out
West
when
I
was
a
sophomore
in
high
school.
Nowadays
IOm
particularly
diligent
when
I
make
special
trips.
Since
high
school
IOve
been
very
detailed
in
my
journals,
trying
hard
to
capture
those
moments
in
words.
I
tend
to
pay
more
attention
to
the
details
of
what
happened
and
forget
to
mention
the
emotional
aspects
of
it.
As
far
as
academic
writing
was
concerned,
I
enjoyed
writing
book
reports
and
science
projects,
but
I
did
not
work
particularly
hard
on
academic
writing
until
high
school.
I
never
had
much
instruction
in
grammar,
a
week
or
so
in
eighth
grade
and
bits
and
snatches
through
high
school
and
college.
I
have
learned
grammar
mostly
through
reading,
and
IOve
become
a
stickler
for
details
such
as
the
difference
between
NitsO
and
NitOsO.
In
high
school
English
I
developed
my
ability
to
write
a
paper
in
order
to
analyze
a
book.
I
turned
in
a
paper
once
and
was
horrified
to
get
a
grade
in
the
60Os
D
the
teacher
informed
me
that
when
I
make
direct
references
to
a
text,
I
needed
to
cite
the
page
numbers.
I
had
probably
learned
this
before,
but
at
that
moment
the
idea
became
so
glaringly
obvious
(and
I
was
so
embarrassed
that
I
completely
neglected
citations)
that
I
became
diligent
in
referencing
my
sources.
In
high
school,
I
encountered
larger
and
larger
writing
projects
that
would
possibly
take
up
a
good
portion
of
year.
We
would
complete
bits
of
the
paper
in
small
steps
under
the
watchful
guidance
of
the
teacher,
building
towards
the
final
product.
Freshman
year,
I
remember
being
overwhelmed
by
the
idea
of
sustaining
an
argument
for
six
or
seven
pages,
but
quickly
realized
that
that
amount
of
space
was
hardly
enough
to
tackle
all
of
the
issues
that
a
novel
or
a
poem
may
present.
Teachers
would
have
different
ideas
for
how
we
were
to
prepare
our
essays.
Some
wanted
us
to
use
outlines,
others
made
us
write
out
note
cards,
and
all
of
them
wanted
smaller
essays
in
five
paragraph
form.
I
preferred
to
write
without
much
preparation
although
once
the
topics
got
more
convoluted
I
would
scatter
ideas
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
cover
it
with
circles
and
arrows
that
probably
only
I
could
understand.
I
also
tried
to
break
out
of
the
five
paragraph
form
because
I
always
felt
that
I
had
more
to
say.
I
was
a
wordy
writer
straight
from
the
beginning,
and
in
an
effort
to
be
precise
I
would
hand
in
five
or
six
pages
when
the
teacher
asked
for
three.
In
my
senior
AP
English
class,
I
was
terrified
of
weekly
timed
writings
in
order
to
prepare
for
the
AP
exam;
everyone
in
the
class
dreaded
Thursdays,
when
we
knew
weOd
come
in
to
find
a
new
40
minute
problem
staring
us
in
the
face.
However,
once
I
got
the
swing
of
it,
I
was
consistently
writing
7s
and
8s,
and
was
thrilled
one
time
when
I
wrote
a
9
and
the
teacher
read
the
essay
aloud
to
the
class.
I
think
I
was
the
only
person
in
my
class
who
actually
enjoyed
the
challenge
of
timed
writings
at
the
end
of
the
year.
In
high
school
I
became
involved
in
the
literary
magazine,
first
as
a
contributor,
then
as
assistant
editor
in
my
junior
year,
and
finally
editor
in
chief
as
a
senior.
Those
of
us
on
the
staff
were
the
main
contributors,
and
I
submitted
both
poetry
and
short
stories.
I
especially
enjoyed
shorts
stories,
and
I
would
randomly
decide
to
start
writing
different
stories
as
exercises
in
certain
styles
of
writing.
Poetry
never
came
as
easily
to
me,
as
the
muse
would
only
strike
when
I
was
overly
emotional,
and
therefore
much
of
my
poetry
in
high
school
is
angry
or
depressing.
This
is
not
because
I
was
miserable
all
the
time,
but
because
I
would
feel
bad
emotions
strong
enough
to
articulate
them
in
poetry.
However,
I
did
have
an
assignment
to
write
a
Shakespearean
sonnet
and
a
poem
in
the
style
of
NDo
Not
Go
Gentle
into
that
Good
NightO
by
Dylan
Thomas.
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
these
assignments
and
my
teacher
said
I
did
particularly
well
on
the
sonnet.
I
forget
his
exact
comments,
but
he
said
I
was
skilled
at
the
manipulation
of
words,
but
I
did
have
a
thesaurus
by
my
side
the
whole
time.
I
was
so
happy
to
find
a
two-syllable
word
for
NsweetO
was
NdulcetO
because
it
fit
perfectly
in
my
poem.
I
donOt
know
if
I
have
a
copy
of
that
poem
anymore,
but
I
remember
it
began
with
the
line
NMy
love,
I
will
wait
till
dawn
for
thee.O
For
all
four
years
of
high
school,
I
worked
as
a
reporter
for
the
local
newspaper,
the
Pitman
Today.
I
mainly
covered
borough
council
meetings
but
I
remember
one
time
I
got
to
cover
the
Miss
Pitman
Pageant
and
I
even
got
to
take
photographs
D
that
was
exciting.
I
had
to
learn
how
to
write
with
an
unbiased
voice,
and
I
tried
to
avoid
overly
using
the
subject-verb-predicate
structure
of
my
sentences
because
I
was
aware
of
having
a
large
audience.
I
wanted
my
articles
to
sound
sophisticated
and
mature,
even
if
they
were
only
about
whether
or
not
we
would
have
fireworks
on
the
Fourth
of
July.
I
never
participated
in
the
high
school
newspaper
because
I
arrogantly
felt
that
the
Pitman
Today
was
more
important.
In
high
school,
I
was
at
the
top
of
my
class,
all
of
my
teachers
praised
my
writing
ability,
and
kids
in
the
school
would
say
they
liked
my
work
that
appeared
in
the
literary
magazine,
so
I
was
sure
that
I
was
a
good
writer.
Then
I
applied
for
governorOs
school
in
creative
writing,
putting
my
heart
and
soul
into
a
short
story.
I
was
devastated
when
I
got
the
letter
from
the
program
saying
NThank
you
for
your
application,
butE.O
That
experience
made
me
realize
that
I
wasnOt
as
good
as
I
thought
I
was,
and
for
a
while
I
gave
up
creative
writing.
But
writing
creatively
feels
so
right
to
me,
and
it
makes
me
happy
to
dive
into
these
different
worlds
of
my
creation,
that
I
didnOt
give
up
entirely.
The
overall
effect
of
being
rejected
from
governorOs
school
(besides
blaming
politics
and
a
very
small
acceptance
rate)
was
for
me
to
work
harder
at
crafting
my
skill.
I
donOt
know
how
much
difference
IOve
made,
since
my
only
training
has
been
through
reading.
Writing
in
college
was
scary
at
first.
A
ten
page
paper
seemed
impossible,
and
my
FYS
instructor
expected
what
seemed
like
huge
amounts
of
research.
I
would
spend
hours
in
the
library
trying
to
get
every
possible
bit
of
information
that
I
could
use,
with
an
irrational
fear
of
accidentally
citing
a
source
incorrectly,
getting
accused
of
plagiarism,
and
getting
kicked
out
of
the
school.
I
tested
out
of
the
college
writing
course
and
took
literary
questions
my
first
semester
freshman
year.
I
was
terrified
of
being
in
an
upper-level
class
as
a
freshman.
I
was
afraid
to
speak
up
at
first
because
I
was
sure
everything
I
said
was
garbage,
and
I
was
exceptionally
nervous
about
handing
in
papers.
I
was
sure
I
wouldnOt
be
good
enough
to
get
a
decent
grade,
but
when
I
got
back
As
I
gained
more
confidence
in
my
ability.
Every
class
I
take,
IOm
nervous
about
my
paper-writing
ability.
Once
I
knew
I
could
write
well
enough
for
200-level
courses,
I
took
my
first
300-level
course.
I
remember
being
so
scared
to
hand
in
papers,
I
was
sure
IOd
do
poorly.
I
viewed
my
A-
in
the
class
as
a
victory,
and
I
finally
began
to
realize
that
I
could
write
at
the
level
of
the
best
students
in
the
class.
Several
of
my
professors
have
told
me
I
am
a
good
writer,
but
IOm
always
trying
to
improve
myself.
I
enjoy
using
a
good
vocabulary
in
my
papers,
and
I
always
try
to
mix
up
the
sentence
structure
to
keep
things
interesting.
IOm
always
afraid
to
let
a
peer
read
my
papers
before
I
turn
them
in,
but
I
find
that
an
outsiderOs
view
can
be
invaluable.
I
had
small
group
sessions
in
my
romance
novel
course
last
semester
for
just
that
purpose,
and
talking
about
my
papers
with
four
other
students
and
the
professor
was
very
helpful
in
my
writing
process.
I
also
found
that
I
enjoyed
helping
my
classmates
improve
their
papers,
which
I
believe
is
a
result
of
becoming
a
better
writer
during
my
time
at
Lafayette,
because
during
freshman
year
I
hated
group
sessions
because
I
would
have
now
idea
how
to
improve
my
own
paper,
let
alone
someone
elseOs.
These
days
I
have
little
time
for
creative
writing,
but
I
am
working
on
three
short
stories
simultaneously
and
I
have
and
idea
for
a
screenplay.
I
have
no
idea
how
to
write
a
screenplay,
so
I
read
scripts
from
my
favorite
movies
online
and
look
forward
to
next
semesterOs
screenplay
writing
class.
I
also
keep
a
blog
D
an
online
journal,
short
for
weblog
D
in
which
I
try
to
capture
certain
moments
of
my
life
to
the
greatest
detail
for
my
friends
to
read.
I
will
also
use
it
as
an
outlet
for
some
creative
writing,
although
much
of
what
I
write
I
never
show
anyone.
