Associate

Written
words
are
the
connection
between
a
personOs
mind
and
the
outside
world.
In
writing,
one
wants
to
communicate
his
or
her
thoughts
in
a
way
that
makes
sense
not
only
to
the
individual,
but
also
to
the
intended
audience.
As
a
Writing
Associate,
I
have
found
that
reading
other
studentsO
work
has
tremendously
influenced
my
ability
to
understand
my
own
intended
audiences.
Reading
and
discussing
my
peersO
writing
has
caused
me
to
follow
assignments
much
more
carefully.
I
now
realize
just
how
important
it
is
to
stay
within
the
scope
of
the
given
topic.
Moreover,
I
am
much
more
confident
in
my
ability
to
review
my
work
in
an
impartial
manner.
I
can
now
put
myself
in
the
position
of
both
professor
and
writer,
which
greatly
helps
the
revision
process.
In
addition
to
helping
me
understand
my
own
intended
audiences,
reading
other
studentsO
work
as
helped
me
to
develop
my
own
writing
style.
I
have
learned,
through
reading
other
studentsO
work,
that
it
is
very
important
to
try
out
different
styles
of
writing.
While
many
students
write
in
the
same
generic
format
that
they
were
taught
in
high
school,
the
most
interesting
papers
are
those
which
use
unique
organization
and
style.
After
reading
WA
papers,
I
realized
that
the
most
interesting
papers
are
those
whose
formats
stand
out.
When
a
student
takes
a
unique
approach
to
how
they
convey
important
information,
it
makes
that
information
stand
out
more
clearly
in
the
readersO
mind.
This
is
especially
important
when
every
student
from
a
given
class
is
writing
on
the
same
topic.
If
the
professor
is
reading
twenty-four
papers
on
the
same
topic,
all
the
papers
will
start
to
sound
like
each
other.
As
a
Writing
Associate,
there
were
some
times
that
I,
too,
had
to
read
almost
twenty
papers
on
the
same
topic.
The
papers
that
still
stand
out
in
my
mind
to
this
day,
however,
are
those
that
took
a
different
approach
to
a
generic
topic.
While
previously
I
had
a
rigid
organization
and
style
format
for
most
of
my
writing,
I
now
take
bigger
risks
with
many
of
my
papers.
This
affords
me
the
opportunity
to
experiment
with
many
different
writing
techniques,
and
because
I
now
write
numerous
drafts
for
each
paper,
I
know
that
I
can
always
revert
back
to
my
old
method
of
writing
if
I
do
not
like
a
new
technique.
I
am
no
longer
afraid
to
try
out
different
writing
styles
and
formats
in
many
of
my
papers.
Thus,
being
a
Writing
Associate
has
greatly
helped
my
own
academic
work.
As
for
incoming
Writing
Associates,
there
are
many
pieces
of
advice
to
be
given.
The
most
important
word
of
wisdom,
however,
is
to
conduct
conferences
as
you
would
any
other
informal
conversation.
That
is
the
single
most
important
piece
of
advice
I
can
offer
to
new
Writing
Associates.
WA
students,
in
general,
will
not
be
willing
to
discuss
their
writing
with
a
Writing
Associate
who
is
speaking
to
the
student
as
if
they
were
beneath
them.
WA
students
are
our
peers,
and
we
should
treat
them
more
as
though
we
are
an
informed
friend,
rather
than
an
assistant
professor.
Much
of
the
dialogue
during
my
WA
conferences
this
past
year
was
not
directly
related
to
writing.
Instead
of
talking
about
commas
and
thesis
statements,
at
first,
we
talked
about
the
summer
vacation
plans,
football,
or
weekend
activities.
After
walking
those
three
flights
of
stairs
and
coming
into
the
WA
room
sweaty
and
out
of
breath,
no
one
wants
to
sit
down
in
a
chair
and
have
someone
critique
their
writing
right
away.
Students
need
a
moment
to
relax
and
unwind.
The
true
trick
of
being
a
WA
is
realizing
how
to
transform
a
conversation
about
everyday
life
into
a
dialogue
about
thesis
statements,
organization,
and
clarity.
It
could
be
something
as
simple
as
asking
them
to
describe,
in
detail,
an
event
from
their
weekend,
and
then
saying,
NWow,
itOs
so
easy
to
understand
you
when
you
speak,
but
some
parts
of
this
detailed
passage
confused
me.
Do
you
ever
read
your
papers
aloud?
It
might
help.O
These
types
of
questions
can
serve
as
a
great
way
to
change
the
topic
of
conversation
from
extracurricular
activities
to
writing.
It
may
take
as
little
as
two
minutes,
or
maybe
even
ten,
but
either
way,
using
those
ten
minutes
to
talk
about
something
other
than
the
WA
conference
will
make
most
conferences
more
effective.
There
are,
however,
those
outliers
who
always
defy
the
rule,
but
in
general,
most
students
have
been
very
receptive
to
this
type
of
interaction.
There
will
always
be
one
or
two
students
who
do
not
appreciate
WA
conferences,
no
matter
what
approach
you
try.
Luckily,
I
only
encountered
one.
By
my
second
conference
with
this
student,
I
tried
a
different
approach.
I
wrote
notes
on
his
paper,
just
as
I
would
have
with
other
students.
However
when
he
came
to
the
WA
room
for
his
scheduled
conference
time,
I
handed
him
his
paper
and
told
him
that
my
comments
were
on
his
paper,
and
he
did
not
have
to
stay
for
the
conference
if
he
did
not
want
to.
After
being
asked
why,
I
replied,
NThese
conferences
are
for
your
benefit
only.
If
you
donOt
see
these
conferences
as
being
beneficial,
you
donOt
have
to
stay.
Either
way,
you
have
thirty
minutes
allotted
to
you.
If
you
want
to
stay,
you
can.
We
donOt
even
have
to
talk
about
writing.
We
donOt
even
have
to
talk
about
this
class.
We
could
talk
about
anything
youOd
like.
But
either
way,
for
the
next
thirty
minutes,
I
canOt
meet
with
any
other
student
but
you.
So
itOs
up
to
you.O
The
student
chose
to
stay,
and
we
talked
about
his
major
and
about
why
he
hated
the
class.
(As
a
general
rule,
I
found
it
best
not
to
engage
in
conversations
about
why
a
student
hated
a
class
other
than
to
ask
questions).
I
came
to
find
out
that
he
did
not
like
meeting
with
me
because
he
felt
like
the
paper
topics
left
no
room
for
innovation
or
creativity.
The
class
was
designed
to
discuss
the
differences
between
science
and
religion,
and,
as
an
agnostic,
some
of
the
paper
topics
left
no
room
for
him
to
write
on
issues
within
the
topic
that
mattered
to
him.
I
encouraged
the
student
to
discuss
this
fact
with
his
professor
and
see
if
there
was
a
way
he
could
both
do
the
assigned
topic,
while
also
discussing
issues
that
mattered
to
him.
For
his
third
paper,
the
student
had
finally
figured
out
a
way
to
not
only
cover
all
aspects
of
the
assignment,
but
also
to
incorporate
his
own
personal
beliefs.
I
was
highly
impressed.
While
most
WA
students
concerns
will
not
be
this
challenging,
it
is
beneficial
to
note
that
some
might
be.
Although
I
did
not
help
this
student
with
concerns
that
were
of
a
higher
order
to
the
Writing
Program,
I
did
help
him
with
a
concern
that
was
of
a
higher
order
to
him.
Thus,
it
was
a
worthwhile
endeavor.
The
second
most
important
point
I
learned
during
my
first
year
as
a
Writing
Associate
was
that
just
as
every
paper
is
different,
so
is
every
student.
While
this
may
seem
like
an
obvious
point,
it
is
a
crucial
factor
to
remember.
Because
every
person
is
different,
so
too
should
every
approach
be
different.
Each
student
has
their
own
history.
Just
as
my
life
experiences
shaped
my
own
writing,
so
too
did
my
studentsO
experiences.
Many
first
year
students
talked
a
lot
about
how
paper
expectations
in
high
school
are
much
different
than
paper
expectations
in
college.
In
high
school,
punctuation,
format,
and
covering
all
aspects
of
an
assignment
were
most
important.
In
college,
however,
professors
expect
that
punctuation
and
other
minor
editing
concerns
will
be
taken
care
of
before
handing
a
paper
in.
Instead,
what
college
professors
look
for
is,
in
part,
the
studentsO
ability
to
effectively
convey
his
or
her
argument.
Effective
argumentation
is
a
key
component
of
good
writing.
It
is
crucial
for
the
writer
to
be
clear
and
concise
in
his
or
her
writing
so
that
his
or
her
point
is
clearly
understood
by
the
intended
audience.
In
addition
to
teaching
the
student
how
to
convey
his
or
her
message
effectively,
Writing
Associates
need
to
convey
their
own
messages
clearly
to
their
WA
students.
Sometimes
a
Writing
Associate
will
be
praising
a
studentsO
work,
but
because
they
are
not
communicating
their
point
effectively,
the
student
leaves
the
conference
thinking
their
WA
NhatedO
their
paper.
To
help
myself
remember
which
points
to
discuss
with
the
student,
I
used
the
conference
record
sheets
to
list
Higher
Order
Concerns
that
needed
to
be
discussed
with
the
student.
After
the
student
left,
I
would
take
out
the
conference
record
sheet
and
check
off
points
that
I
spoke
with
them
about,
and
then
elaborate
on
those
points.
During
a
conference,
it
is
very
easy
to
get
sidetracked,
or
to
focus
on
a
single
issue
too
long.
However,
if
a
brief
outline
is
right
there
in
front
of
you,
then
you
as
the
Writing
Associate
can
budget
your
time
accordingly.
While
talking
with
returning
Writing
Associates
can
help,
the
only
way
to
truly
understand
how
to
have
an
effective
WA
conference
is
to
personally
experience
one.
A
new
Writing
AssociateOs
first
round
of
WA
conferences
are
not
going
to
go
as
planned.
The
best
way
to
prepare
for
that
first
round
is
to
not
plan
anything
at
all.
Be
ready
with
a
very
brief
list
of
what
needs
to
be
discussed
with
each
individual
writer,
but
know
ahead
of
time
that
not
all
things
on
the
list
will
be
discussed.
Students
will
still
be
getting
to
know
you,
and
they
may
feel
awkward
or
uncomfortable
discussing
their
writing
with
a
new
WA
at
this
point.
Likewise,
the
new
WA
may
feel
uncomfortable
discussing
another
personOs
writing
in
the
WA
room
setting.
I
think
it
is
important
that
new
Was
know
that
all
Was
go
through
these
feelings
during
their
first
round
of
conferences.
Knowing
that
everyone
has
had
a
student
who
refuses
to
discuss
their
writing
in
detail,
or
who
skips
their
meeting
time,
may
make
it
easier
for
new
WAs
to
conduct
that
first
conference.
Also,
it
is
important
to
realize
that
the
very
first
conference
will
not
go
as
well
as
the
very
last
conference
of
the
same
round
of
conferences.
So
with
that
in
mind,
it
is
nice
to
know
that
with
every
new
conference,
the
Writing
Associate
is
becoming
more
effective
at
his
or
her
job.
Writing
is
an
important
tool
for
communication.
The
reason
Lafayette
College
stresses
the
importance
of
writing
is
because
it
wants
its
students
to
reenter
the
world
as
educated
citizens
who
can
effectively
communicate
their
ideas
both
in
speech
and
on
paper.
The
Writing
Program
successfully
aids
both
levels
of
communication
in
that
it
stresses
the
importance
of
written
ideas
through
verbal
interaction.
In
every
WA
conference,
students
and
WAs
like
are
verbally
conveying
their
thoughts
to
each
other.
The
entire
conference
is
designed
as
a
medium
through
which
students
can
improve
both
their
written
and
oral
communication
skills.
Thus,
the
WA
conference
in
itself
serves
to
promote
the
CollegeOs
goal
of
producing
educated
students
with
strong
abilities
in
effective
communication.
However
the
Writing
ProgramOs
purpose
goes
much
deeper
than
that.
Its
purpose
is
not
only
to
serve
the
collegeOs
goal,
but
more
importantly,
its
purpose
to
provide
confidence
in
its
students
to
a
point
where
they
are
not
only
confident
in
their
writing
abilities,
but
also
where
they
are
comfortable
in
and
with
themselves.
College
is
place
for
growth.
It
is
a
place
where
students
discover
themselves
for
perhaps
the
first
time
in
their
life.
Also,
it
is
a
sort
of
rite
of
passage
for
some
people
from
adolescence
to
adulthood.
It
is
a
medium
through
which
we
pass
to
effectively
make
the
change
from
high
school
to
the
marketplace.
College
teaches
us
how
to
effectively
promote
ourselves
within
that
marketplace.
The
Writing
Program
teaches
students
and
WAs
alike
how
to
communicate
ideas
through
both
written
word
and
oral
discussion.
By
the
end
of
a
given
semester,
most
students
learn
how
to
effectively
promote
their
ideas
on
paper.
That
is
the
purpose
of
college
papers,
is
it
not?
The
purpose
of
papers
is
to
show
the
professor
that
we,
as
students,
have
the
ability
to
effectively
communicate
ideas,
while
promoting
our
own
personal
views
on
those
ideas.
When
conducting
conferences,
Writing
Associates
must
keep
in
mind
that
their
influence
extends
beyond
the
reach
of
the
classroom
or
this
roundOs
paper
topics.
Keep
in
mind
that
the
student
is
not
the
only
one
benefiting
from
discussions
on
writing.
The
Writing
Associate
is
also
gaining
something.
He
or
she
is
gaining
a
new
perspective
on
writing
every
time
he
or
she
sits
down
in
the
WA
room
and
meets
with
students.
That
is
the
beauty
of
the
Writing
Program;
everyone
benefits.
There
is
always
something
to
learn.
As
for
new
Writing
Associates,
keep
in
mind
that
no
on
is
a
professional
WA.
Some
conferences
will
go
smoothly,
others
will
not.
Writing
conferences
are
somewhat
like
life;
expect
the
unexpected,
and
you
will
always
be
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
outcome.
