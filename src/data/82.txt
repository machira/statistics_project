A
Recent
Writing
History
K.
August
20,
1996
What
stands
out
most
to
me
about
my
writing
experience
of
the
last
year
is
its
distinction
from
experiences
of
any
previous
years.
Certainly,
each
year
since
I
could
read
and
write,
my
writing
styles
and
experiences
have
changed.
My
writing
style
has
developed
over
the
years
due
to
the
influence
of
many
people.
As
a
young
child,
my
parents
taught
me
to
read
and
write.
Later,
it
was
the
many
teachers
I
had
throughout
school
who
helped
form
my
opinions
of
what
good
or
bad
writing
was.
Each
year,
someone
was
looking
over
my
shoulder
to
tell
me
again
that
what
once
was
quality
writing
no
longer
passed
the
test.
As
a
result,
my
writing
has
greatly
improved
over
the
years
-
especially
the
last
two
since
I
started
college
and
was
handed
a
harsh
reality
check
when
I
received
my
first
C+
ever
on
a
paper
I
had
written.
I
thank
every
person
who
has
somehow
challenged
me
and
played
a
role
in
making
me
the
reader
and
writer
I
was
a
year
ago.
This
year,
however,
I
faced
a
different
sort
of
challenge
that
shaped
my
recent
writing
experiences.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
has
changed
the
way
I
read
both
others
papers
and
my
own.
I
approach
a
paper
with
a
different
attitude
and
am
far
more
aware
of
what
I
read
and
write,
regardless
of
what
it
is.
For
the
first
time,
no
one
stood
looking
over
my
shoulder;
instead,
that
became
my
job,
and
it
was
the
events
surrounding
those
circumstances
that
have
shaped
my
writing
experience
of
the
past
year.
When
I
first
walked
into
last
year's
WA
workshop,
I
wasn't
quite
sure
what
to
expect.
I
felt
a
little
like
I
had
been
let
into
some
sort
of
club
but
hadn't
been
given
all
the
membership
information
yet.
I
suppose
I
expected
to
leave
the
meeting
knowing
the
secret
formula
that
would
give
me
the
authority
to
critique
someone
else's
work.
I
was
already
given
the
power
to
do
so
when
someone
thought
I
could
handle
being
a
WA,
but
I
really
had
no
idea
what
to
do
with
that
power.
At
the
time,
it
seemed
like
a
lot
to
handle;
what
right
did
I
have
to
pass
judgment
on
what
another
person
thought
of
and
put
on
paper?
At
the
same
time,
I
couldn't
help
but
feel
rather
confident
in
myself
as
we
settled
in
for
the
workshop.
I
figured
if
everyone
else
in
the
room
could
do
this,
I
certainly
could
do
just
as
good
a
job
as
any
of
them.
Well,
I
have
to
admit,
I
did
not
leave
the
workshop
with
any
secret
formulas
or
fail-safe
ways
to
be
a
good
WA
-
if
anyone
else
thinks
of
any,
please
let
me
know
-
but
I
did
walk
out
of
there
with
a
much
better
understanding
of
what
I
had
gotten
myself
into.
For
the
new
Writing
Associates,
I
feel
the
workshop
offered
us
the
basic
information
we
needed
to
get
going.
The
question/answer
time
spent
with
old
WA's
in
a
large
group
was
a
huge
help.
It
was
good
to
hear
their
stories,
both
good
and
bad.
It
gave
me
an
idea
what
to
expect
when
dealing
with
students
in
scheduling
and
holding
conferences.
Hearing
the
points
of
view
of
a
few
professors
gave
me
a
glimpse
into
how
they
see
WA's
and
how
to
approach
them
with
questions
I
may
have.
Overall,
I
was
left
with
a
sense
of
confidence
that
I
knew
enough
to
handle
my
first
conferences
and
could
improvise
as
I
went
along.
I
didn't
have
to
wait
long
to
find
out
first-hand
what
being
a
WA
was
all
about.
I
think
my
first
round
of
conferences
was
about
a
week
after
the
workshop.
Now,
I've
never
been
one
to
get
nervous
or
scared
about
something
I
had
to
do;
instead,
I
have
a
tendency
to
overprepare.
I
spent
almost
45
minutes
reading
each
of
sixteen
papers,
asking
questions,
and
taking
notes
on
a
separate
sheet
of
paper
to
prepare
for
each
conference.
Looking
back,
I
realize
I
may
have
put
a
little
too
much
time
and
effort
into
my
preparations,
but
I
felt
more
comfortable
having
done
so.
In
fact,
the
comments
and
questions
I
wrote
turned
out
to
be
a
good
starting
point
for
almost
every
conference.
Not
only
was
being
a
WA
completely
new
to
me,
but
the
students
I
was
supposed
to
be
WA-ing
had
never
even
heard
of
a
WA
until
shortly
before
they
met
me.
At
the
time,
I
thought
that
was
an
important
point
to
keep
in
mind.
Now
a
year
later
and
wiser,
I
feel
that
may
be
one
of
the
most
important
points
of
all
to
remember
as
a
WA
when
I
read
a
paper
or
conduct
a
conference.
I
found
out
that
it
takes
two
willing
participants
to
have
a
productive
conference.
For
a
student
to
want
to
go
to
a
WA
conference,
they
must
have
some
sense
of
trust
and
faith
in
the
person
they're
allowing
to
critique
their
writing.
I
know
I
often
have
a
tough
time
allowing
someone
else
to
read
what
I
write
and
expected
many
of
the
freshmen
to
feel
the
same
way.
I
was
careful
to
offer
as
much
positive
feedback
about
a
paper
as
I
did
any
criticism.
After
talking
with
my
professor
and
reading
the
students'
first
drafts,
I
was
fairly
confident
I
would
be
able
to
offer
at
least
some
help
to
everyone
in
the
class
if
I
could
get
my
point
across
in
a
conference.
Despite
all
this
work,
or
maybe
in
because
of
it,
the
first
round
of
conferences
were
almost
fun.
I
ended
up
really
enjoying
myself.
I
had
a
completed
draft
from
every
single
person,
and
not
one
of
them
missed
our
scheduled
appointment.
I
never
had
anything
to
contribute
to
the
horror
stories
some
WA's
tell
about
professors
who
change
conferences
without
informing
their
WA
or
students
who
show
up
with
no
work
or
simply
don't
come
to
conferences.
My
conferences
went
relatively
smoothly
and
gave
me
a
chance
to
put
a
face
and
personality
with
the
papers
I
had
been
poring
over
for
days.
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
almost
every
student
came
willingly
to
our
conference.
Some
came
with
their
own
list
of
questions
and
concerns,
and
a
few
even
had
another
draft
ready
to
show
me.
It
was
a
bit
nerve-wracking
to
realize
that
most
of
the
students
assumed
I
was
or
expected
me
to
be
an
expert
writer
who
could
solve
all
their
problems,
something
I,
of
course,
was
not.
However,
I
found
that
I
was
able
to
answer
questions,
offer
ideas,
and
mostly
listen
to
what
they
had
to
say.
Just
talking
and
bouncing
ideas
off
each
other
gave
almost
everyone
a
starting
point
for
their
revisions.
Meanwhile,
I
was
beginning
my
own
writing
class
with
another
new
WA
who
happened
to
also
be
a
good
friend
of
mine
and
had
read
almost
every
paper
I
had
turned
in
over
the
past
year.
^
I
took
one
of
the
few
VAST
courses
offered
in
the
fall,
a
class
taught
by
an
engineering
professor
who
had
never
had
a
WA
before.
In
this
case,
the
tables
had
turned,
and
it
was
the
us,
the
class,
who
were
not
the
newcomers.
As
a
result,
t
think
a
lot
of
people
tried
to
take
advantage
of
both
the
professor
and
our
WA.
Or
perhaps
it
was
because
we
were
no
longer
scared
Freshmen,
and
all
WA's
know
what
a
pain
Sophomores
can
be
when
it
comes
to
WA
conferences.
Whatever
the
reason,
I
knew
I
couldn't
get
away
with
it.
Not
only
would
my
friend
be
less
than
thrilled
if
I
made
her
life
more
difficult
than
she
already
did
herself,
but
I
could
see
the
situation
from
both
sides
and
put
myself
in
her
shoes.
I
found
myself
doing
the
same
sorts
of
things
I
saw
from
certain
students
in
the
class
I
WA'd.
I
became
more
critical
and
spent
more
time
revising
my
work
before
I
would
let
anyone
else
read
it.
I
began
considering
the
questions
I
had
been
asked
in
conferences
and
relating
them
to
my
own
writing,
both
in
my
VAST
and
other
courses.
I
started
to
pay
attention
to
the
critiques
and
comments
I
made
in
a
conference;
if
I
could
make
suggestions
to
improve
someone
else's
paper
or
their
overall
writing,
it
certainly
made
sense
to
have
enough
faith
in
myself
to
follow
my
own
advice.
As
the
semester
continued,
I
became
more
confident
in
both
my
own
work
and
my
work
as
a
WA.
For
me,
the
key
to
being
successful
was
to
be
flexible.
I
was
lucky
enough
to
be
assigned
to
a
professor
who
knew
well
the
job
of
a
WA
and
let
me
do
my
job.
Other
than
setting
the
rule
that
she
would
not
accept
a
paper
I
had
not
read,
I
was
allowed
to
kind
of
set
the
schedule.
For
the
second
round
of
conferences,
not
everyone
handed
me
a
draft
days
ahead
of
time.
I
received
everything
from
complete
folders
of
all
brainstorming
and
drafts
to
a
promise
that
I
would
have
it
before
the
conference.
Honestly,
that
was
fine
with
me.
As
long
as
the
professor
had
no
problem
with
these
arrangements,
we
were
more
comfortable
with
this
than
the
etched-in-stone
rules
some
professors
and
WA's
had.
Instead
of
being
annoyed
that
a
student
showed
up
at
the
conference
with
something
I
had
not
read,
I
was
happy
that
they
had
put
some
more
work
into
their
paper
instead
of
handing
it
in
to
their
professor
and
forgetting
about
it
until
their
conference.
I
did
say
that
the
more
information
I
had,
the
better
our
conference
would
be
and
the
more
I
could
help.
If
it
wasn't
a
completed
draft,
even
a
sheet
of
brainstorming
was
a
start.
We
could
work
with
that.
With
few
exceptions,
I
don't
think
that
I
was
taken
advantage
of
or
walked
over
because
I
tried
to
be
as
flexible
as
possible.
Some
WA's
think
that
if
they
don't
stick
to
the
same
routine,
they
will
have
no
control
over
their
conferences
and
can't
do
their
job.
That
attitude
doesn't
fit
my
personality
at
all.
I
feel
that
I
did
a
good
job
of
adapting
to
what
each
student
wanted
and
expected
from
our
conferences
and
from
me
as
a
WA.
I
liked
the
fact
that
many
of
the
students
wanted
to
schedule
another
non-required
conference
after
they
revised
a
paper
but
before
it
was
turned
in
to
the
professor.
I
had
no
problem
with
getting
an
email
or
a
call
from
someone
the
night
before
a
paper
was
due
when
they
wanted
to
know
if
I
possible
had
a
minute
to
listen
to
something
they
wrote
or
to
discuss
again
a
concept
we
had
addressed
during
a
conference.
I
enjoyed
knowing
that
at
least
a
few
people
thought
I
was
actually
helping
them
and
weren't
just
talking
to
me
because
they
were
forced
to.
The
biggest
challenge
I
probably
faced
as
a
WA
was
not
annoying
students
who
brushed
me
off
or
a
professor
who
drove
me
crazy;
instead,
the
toughest
dilemma
I
faced
were
those
students
who
tried
the
hardest
and
wanted
the
most
to
write
better.
There
were
a
few
students
in
the
class
who
had
trouble
composing
a
legitimate
paragraph.
At
first,
I
was
shocked
that
anyone
could
make
it
all
the
way
to
college
without
learning
(he
basic
facts
of
how
to
write
a
paper.
My
13-year
old
sister
could
write
more
coherently
than
some
college
students.
However,
as
I
thought
about
this,
I
realized
that
all
the
people
who
stood
looking
over
my
shoulder
as
I
grew
were
not
there
to
watch
over
everyone.
If
no
one
ever
taught
you
to
write
that
basic
five
paragraph
junior
high
essay,
it's
not
possible
to
move
past
that
to
what
may
be
considered
college
level
writing.
In
the
WA
workshop,
we
discussed
HOCs
and
LOCs;
sometimes,
I
found
it
difficult
to
focus
only
on
the
really
big
HOCs.
But
that
was
what
I
had
to
do.
During
the
second
round
of
conferences,
I
had
a
few
where
we
sat
and
completely
reorganized
and
reworded
entire
papers.
We
discussed
how
to
write
a
topic
sentence
and
why
it
needed
to
be
part
of
every
paragraph.
I
even
tried
to
use
the
same
approach
that
a
teacher
used
with
me
years
before
in
elementary
school
to
understand
sentence
and
paragraph
structure.
We
discussed
what
a
thesis
statement
should
tell
the
reader
about
the
paper.
I
really
felt
that
if
they
could
get
past
the
details
to
a
coherent
paper,
the
ideas
were
there
waiting
to
be
developed.
I
couldn't
have
been
happier
when,
in
the
third
conferences,
it
seemed
that
I
noticed
a
difference
in
what
I
was
reading.
Maybe
it
was
just
me
seeing
what
I
wanted
to
see.
I
don't
think
that
I
was
necessarily
the
cause
of
any
improvements;
I
certainly
wasn't
the
one
teaching
the
course.
But
I
found
this
challenge
to
be
rather
interesting
because,
as
it
turned
out,
I
soon
found
myself
in
the
exactly
the
same
position
facing
the
same
sort
of
problems.
Second
semester,
I
was
not
a
WA.
I
did,
however,
take
another
class
that
used
a
WA
-French
213,
a
French
history
course
taught
entirely
in
French.
For
the
first
time,
I
was
expected
to
write
a
seven
page
paper
in
another
language.
Though
I
had
written
two
or
three
page
essays
on
an
assigned
topic,
I
never
thought
I
had
the
knowledge
or
vocabulary
to
attack
a
''real"
paper
someone
might
actually
enjoy
reading.
It
was
difficult
enough
to
remember
all
the
accents
and
grammar
rules
floating
around
in
my
head
without
even
considering
if
I
was
actually
making
a
point.
It
took
me
hours
longer
to
write
what
I
thought
was
a
decent
two
pages
in
French
than
it
had
ever
taken
me
in
English.
It
was
almost
painful
to
put
that
much
effort
into
something
I
didn't
even
feel
was
quality
work.
When
I
met
with
my
French
WA,
she
completely
destroyed
my
paper.
What
I
did
have
of
a
draft
when
I
went
in
was
little
more
than
a
page
of
notes
to
start
over
when
I
left.
As
a
WA
for
French,
her
job
was
a
bit
different
than
for
the
rest
of
us.
She
was
supposed
to
correct
and
help
us
with
our
grammar.
My
WA
did
that
but
also
showed
me
that
it
would
take
a
lot
more
experience
and
work
to
write
what
I
would
have
considered
an
okay
paper
in
English.
I
realized
that
I
was
in
the
same
position
as
some
of
the
Freshmen
who
were
in
the
class
I
WA'd.
I
was
suddenly
learning
how
to
write
again
like
I
was
in
elementary
school
in
much
the
same
way
as
I
attempted
to
guide
them
as
they
struggled
with
a
college
level
assignment
and
a
high
school
level
writing.
My
second
attempt
at
writing
a
paper
in
French
was
far
more
successful
than
the
first.
Both
my
professor
and
my
WA
insisted
I
had
made
huge
improvements
from
the
first
paper.
I
don't
know
about
that,
but
I
do
know
that
the
second
paper
was
much
easier
to
write.
I
was
more
comfortable
with
what
I
was
doing
and
tried
to
focus
forming
and
following
a
thesis.
In
English,
it
would
probably
have
been
a
format
quite
like
one
I
may
have
followed
in
high
school
but
have
since
tried
to
avoid.
However,
in
French,
it
was
my
biggest
accomplishment.
I
think
that's
how
some
of
the
Freshmen
in
my
class
felt
when
they
finally
grasped
what
they
had
to
do
to
write
a
paper
another
person
could
understand.
The
experiences
I
have
had
as
a
WA
have
shaped
the
way
I
approach
the
coming
year.
I
feel
like
I
have
had
a
year
of
training
to
prepare
me
for
whatever
comes
next.
My
personal
writing
experiences
have
taught
me
to
be
aware
of
not
only
the
thesis
statements
and
supporting
details
but
the
way
each
individual
approaches
a
writing
assignment.
Everyone
has
different
expectations
of
themselves
and
of
their
WA
or
professor.
I
saw
both
sides
of
the
situation,
first
as
a
WA
and
also
as
a
WA-ee.
I
may
have
helped
the
students
I
WA'd,
but
they
also
taught
me
to
be
a
WA
and
to
be
a
better,
more
aware
writer
myself.
The
positive
experience
I
have
had
in
the
past
year
has
made
me
eager
to
start
it
all
again
and
see
what
the
next
year
brings.
