WA
Assignment
Good
Night,
Vienna
In
5-7
typed
pages,
double-spaced,
comment
on
language
as
a
means
to
understanding
culture.
When
I
first
received
eighteen
essays
from
my
first-year
seminar
Chinese
culture
course,
my
fall
semester
WA
appointment,
I
had
little
clue
as
to
how
much
this
topic
would
become
relevant
in
my
own
life
over
the
course
of
the
year.
This
past
year
in
my
literary
history
has
been
unlike
any
other,
particularly
because
most
of
my
own
writing
was
done
in
a
foreign
language.
While
fall
semester
was
spent
as
a
returning
junior
WA,
directing
a
short
play,
and
taking
part
in
an
inspiring
Native
American
culture
seminar,
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
spend
spring
semester
in
elegant
Vienna,
Austria
studying
economics
and
the
German
language.
Not
only
did
I
take
my
first
literature
course
since
high
school
this
past
semester,
but
the
fact
that
it
was
in
German
made
it
even
more
of
a
challenge
for
me.
Class
discussions,
at-home
reading,
and
writing
in-depth
analysis
on
a
variety
of
German
literary
classics
broadened
my
horizons
as
a
writer
and
as
a
thinker,
and
the
opportunity
allowed
me
to
realize
the
power
of
language
in
studying
the
culture
of
one's
foreign
surroundings.
The
third
piece
that
I
would
say
completes
the
puzzle
of
my
past
literary
year
experience
is
the
time
spent
on
my
personal
journal
writing.
The
past
eight
months
have
been
honestly
some
of
the
most
beautiful,
most
difficult,
and
most
exhilarating
of
my
life.
It
was
my
job
to
get
these
experiences
down
on
paper
in
my
own
words,
so
that
later
I
could
look
back
and
remember
those
times
clearly
just
from
what
I
was
feeling
in
my
heart
at
the
time.
Certainly
I
was
my
own
audience,
but
sometimes
that
is
the
hardest
audience
of
all.
For
this
final
WA
writing
assignment,
I
hope
to
combine
all
that
I
have
learned
on
my
journey
of
the
recent
past
and
hope
to
draw
a
clear
picture
of
the
variety
of
literary
experience
I
was
fortunate
to
have
over
the
past
year.
I
do
promise
not
to
write
in
German.
Sept.

And
so
begins
another
year.
Today
officially
kicked
off
my
fall
semester
as
a
returning
Writing
Associate,
and
the
workshop
itself
was
not
too
painful.
After
last
year's
thrilling
"Technology
and
Energy"
first-year
seminar,
I
am
intrigued
and
anxious
to
be
involved
with
Prof
Bennett's
"Chinese
Contemporary
Culture"
course.
Certainly,
China
is
the
next
big
thing
coming,
and
the
more
I
can
learn
about
this
sleeping
giant,
the
better.
My
meeting
with
Prof.
Bennett
this
week
was
successful.
He
seems
to
be
very
knowledgeable
about
the
material
and
excited
about
teaching
the
course.
I
hope
the
freshmen
students
will
feel
the
same
way,
and
I
look
forward
to
meeting
them.
This
past
week
I
also
started
Prof.
Walls'
"Native
American
Culture
Seminar,"
which
I
have
been
looking
forward
to
for
months
now.
With
only
eight
students
in
the
class,
it
promises
to
be
an
intensive
class
with
much
controversial
discussion
and
constant
readings.
With
having
to
complete
all
my
major
requirements,
this
will
be
the
first
intense
writing
course
I
have
taken
since
freshman
year,
and
I
hope
I
can
easily
get
back
into
the
swing
of
things.

Language
as
a
means
to
understanding
culture.
The
first
essay
assignment
for
the
Chinese
culture
course
was
finally
due
after
Prof.
Bennett
pushed
the
deadline
back
for
the
third
time.
Amazingly,
some
students
still
could
not
get
past
the
third
page
in
their
rough
drafts.
Overall
I
was
impressed
with
the
students
work,
and
I
enjoyed
finally
meeting
with
them
one
on
one.
They
seemed
very
receptive
to
criticisms,
and
I
found
them
to
be
more
concerned
about
their
writing
than
last
year's
class.
Reading
and
reviewing
these
papers
was
also
a
personal
learning
experience
as
well.
The
first
part
of
each
essay
was
to
explain
some
background
on
the
Chinese
language.
I
had
known
very
little
before,
but
with
each
reading,
I
learned
more
and
more
about
the
construction
of
characters,
the
differences
in
tone
and
sounds,
and
the
relation
between
the
various
syllables
and
the
writing
itself.
Quite
a
complex
language,
and
while
I
am
glad
that
I
am
not
responsible
for
learning
this
written
and
spoken
language,
I
surely
admire
those
who
have
mastered
it.
The
more
interesting
part
of
the
assignment
was
the
students'
analysis
in
trying
to
support
that
understanding
the
Chinese
language
is
the
first
step
to
understanding
the
Chinese
culture.
This
was
done
in
various
ways.
One
example
is
the
Chinese
character
for
'happiness'.
This
written
character
is
expressed
as
a
combination
of
the
characters
for
'mountains'
and
'rivers'.
In
this
way,
one
can
conclude
that
the
importance
of
nature
and
beauty
brings
peace
to
the
people,
and
that
is
where
the
people
can
easily
find
joy
and
tranquility.
Similar
examples
were
taken
by
examining
the
character
combinations
of
other
words,
or
by
decoding
ancient
Chinese
poems
and
proverbs.
In
my
own
world
of
writing,
the
seminar
is
moving
along
wonderfully.
Each
class
the
topics
just
blow
my
mind,
and
Prof.
Walls
does
his
best
to
direct
the
discussion
in
a
stimulating
direction.
The
personal
views
in
the
class
vary,
and
I
am
sure
that
all
of
us
are
learning
horrifying
realities
that
we
never
dreamed
could
have
existed.
For
each
class
a
short
writing
assignment
is
due
as
a
reaction
to
the
readings.
Walls
encourages
us
to
freely
express
our
views
and
back
up
our
thoughts
with
examples
from
the
text,
and
I
am
enjoying
this
freedom.
Luckily,
these
are
controversial
topics
that
I
can
really
spout
out
opinion,
and
Prof.
Walls
makes
us
all
feel
comfortable
enough
that
we
can
be
honest
with
him,
whatever
side
we
choose
on
an
issue.
I
have
decided
to
research
the
changing
roles
of
Native
American
women
before
and
since
colonization,
and
I
look
forward
to
getting
started
with
that.
Rehearsals
for
'Lepers',
the
play
I
am
directing
and
producing
this
semester,
began
this
week.
I
am
trying
not
to
be
too
demanding
on
the
actresses
as
far
as
time,
for
I
am
aware
that
we
are
all
busy.
I
have
to
rewrite
parts
of
the
script
in
order
to
make
it
pertain
more
relevantly
to
our
topic,
the
present
plight
of
the
Afghan
women,
and
that
is
presenting
a
challenge.
Being
a
director
is
a
wholly
new
experience
for
me,
and
while
I
am
able
to
make
all
the
decisions,
there
are
a
number
of
responsibilities
to
be
handled,
and
I
hope
I
am
able
to
balance
it
all.

Another
semester
quickly
drawn
to
a
close.
After
much
stress,
hard
work,
and
long
hours,
the
play
was
a
complete
success,
and
my
only
regret
is
that
it
could
only
be
performed
on
a
single
night.
The
woman
from
Washington,
D.C.,
who
spoke
at
the
show,
stirred
everyone's
hearts,
and
her
poem
was
a
beautiful,
profound
introduction
to
'Lepers'.
The
girls
did
a
wonderful
job,
and
I
felt
what
it
is
truly
like
to
be
a
director
during
the
show,
unable
to
sit
down,
clutching
and
writhing
my
fingers
the
entire
time.
I
was
reminded
of
the
time
and
effort
that
goes
into
writing
a
real
research
paper,
and
thank
goodness
for
my
sake
that
I
really
loved
the
topic
I
was
investigating
for
Walls'
class.
In-class
debates
helped
me
develop
my
verbal
expression,
which
was
much
improved,
considering
I
am
usually
the
one
who
feels
too
shy
to
make
a
comment
in
discussion.
Mostly
I
find
myself
holding
back
and
nervous,
but
in
this
small
class
setting,
I
had
no
problem
arguing
and
presenting
my
thoughts.
I
feel
as
if
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
have
another
successful
semester
as
a
writing
associate,
and
working
with
the
students
on
their
final
papers
was
productive
and
thought
provoking.
Each
student
chose
a
different
controversial
issue
in
Chinese
history
and
had
to
present
both
sides
of
the
issue
at
hand.
It
then
turned
into
a
persuasive
paper,
and
I
helped
the
students
clearly
explain
their
stances
and
make
powerful
arguments.
I
actually
had
fun
working
with
this
group
of
students,
and
I
was
also
able
to
act
as
their
sounding
board
when
they
complained
of
the
tons
of
work
they
had
to
complete
and
of
how
tough
Prof.
Bennett
was.
I
assured
them
that
my
first-year
seminar
was
certainly
no
picnic,
but
the
quality
of
work
the
professor
demanded
helped
me
develop
my
overall
college
work
ethic.
I
am
not
sure
they
were
convinced.
March
18,
2001
-1
have
been
in
Vienna
now
almost
two
months,
and
everyday
there
is
more
to
explore
in
this
charmingly
sophisticated
city.
Vienna
seems
to
me
like
some
sort
of
hidden
treasure.
While
there
are
a
number
of
tourists
around,
many
people
forget
about
Vienna
on
their
grand
European
tours,
and
for
the
most
part,
the
city
is
all
ours.
I
have
found
people
of
all
backgrounds
and
all
dispositions.
The
Austrian
students
I
meet
through
friends
or
in
the
dorms
are
a
joy
to
encounter,
but
others
choose
not
to
be
bothered
with
meeting
new
people,
especially
exchange
students.
However,
the
kindest
people
I
have
met
are
those
studying
here
from
Eastern
European
countries.
In
talking
with
these
friends,
I
am
able
to
most
successfully
enhance
my
German
speaking
skills.
For
one,
they
actually
want
to
speak
German
with
us,
while
the
other
Austrians
and
Germans
we
know
have
studied
English
for
over
a
decade
and
hope
to
put
those
skills
into
practice.
In
addition,
coming
to
Austria
to
speak
German
is
similar
to
learning
English
and
going
to
southern
Alabama
to
speak
it.
The
dialect
of
the
people
here
is
sometimes
impossible
to
decipher,
and
this
has
been
quite
a
frustrating
challenge
for
all
of
us
on
the
program.
When
our
Austrian
friends
talk
directly
to
us,
they
speak
clearly,
but
when
I
sit
and
listen
to
a
conversation
between
two
Austrians
I
can
barely
understand.
This
is
hard
to
deal
with,
especially
when
I
think
I
am
making
progress
with
the
language.
This
past
month
I
began
my
first
literature
course
since
high
school--in
German
of
course.
Prof.
Murray,
the
director
of
the
program,
is
a
strange
type,
but
there
is
something
about
him
that
I
admire
in
his
teaching.
He
truly
loves
what
he
does,
and
is
very
knowledgeable
about
German
writers,
philosophers,
and
thinkers.
Our
course
material
covers
a
range
of
historic
German
literature
from
Goethe
to
Kafka
to
Plenzdorf,
and
Prof.
Murray
demands
more
of
a
philosophical
analysis
in
our
papers.
I
have
realized
the
extent
to
which
German
authors
really
tested
the
boundaries
of
their
societies
and
their
minds.
From
romanticism
of
the
1800s
to
Exile
literature
of
the
1940s
to
literature
against
the
socialism
of
the
East
in
recent
years,
German
authors
have
tackled
these
times
with
ironical
satire
and
bitter
truth
of
the
realities
that
existed.
I
believe
this
course
will
be
the
most
demanding
over
the
next
few
months,
and
Prof.
Murray
loves
to
put
us
on
the
spot
during
in-class
discussion.
The
past
few
months
I
have
also
come
to
appreciate
my
own
English
language.
An
Italian
friend
of
ours,
who
lives
with
us
in
the
dorm,
studies
here
and
refuses
to
learn
German,
but
wants
nothing
else
than
to
learn
English
from
us.
Since
his
arrival,
his
language
skills
have
improved
immensely,
but
he
still
throws
in
odd
word
choice
here
and
there,
which
never
fails
to
bring
a
heap
of
laughter
from
the
rest
of
us.
For
instance,
he
came
into
the
kitchen
one
hot
afternoon
saying,
"I
am
bleeding,
I
am
bleeding!"
Concerned,
we
wanted
to
know
what
was
wrong,
but
he
explained,
"I
am
hot
and
this
stuff
on
my
face..."
With
a
hint
of
realization
on
our
faces
we
replied,
"Oh,
Davide,
you
are
sweating!"
June

And
with
a
blink
of
my
eye,
my
semester
in
Vienna
had
come
to
a
close.
I
certainly
cannot
complain.
I
feel
as
if
so
much
has
happened
in
the
past
six
months,
that
it
could
have
been
four
years
of
college
in
and
of
itself.
One
thing
is
for
sure.
I
am
marrying
a
man
who
speaks
another
language,
and
will
raise
my
children
bilingual,
so
they
will
not
have
to
struggle
like
I
have
to
grasp
a
foreign
language.
In
the
States
we
do
not
realize
the
importance
of
mastering
a
foreign
language,
and
even
worse,
students
are
not
even
encouraged
to
try.
Starting
language
training
when
a
student
if
already
13
or
14,
and
then
not
requiring
the
student
to
continue
after
a
year
or
so
is
a
poor
system
in
my
experience.
Certainly
everywhere
in
the
world
people
are
speaking
English,
but
what
an
amazing
feeling
to
be
able
to
communicate
in
their
own
language.
Language
as
a
means
to
understanding
culture.
It
is
absolutely
true.
In
this
way
one
can
see
the
logic
and
sense
in
the
German
language
and
people.
The
vibrant
and
exciting
Italian
language
is
certainly
a
reflection
of
the
Italian
people,
and
comparisons
can
be
made
all
over
the
globe.
Many
times
I
feel
very
ignorant
in
my
meager
language
knowledge,
and
when
I
traveled
this
semester
to
Spain,
France,
the
Netherlands,
Slovakia,
Hungary,
Italy,
or
the
Czech
Republic,
I
was
forced
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
somewhere
I
would
be
able
to
find
English
speaking
people
to
explain
things
to
this
unlearned
traveler.
However,
I
refuse
to
get
down
on
myself
about
it,
and
look
forward
gratefully
to
six
weeks
of
freedom
in
Switzerland,
Italy,
England,
Scotland,
Ireland,
and
Germany.

Back
on
my
home
soil
at
last.
When
my
plane
touched
down
in
Kennedy
Airport,
a
smile
crept
slowly
onto
my
face,
and
my
heart
sent
a
flurry
of
excitement
through
my
limbs.
After
months
of
breath-taking
travel,
unimaginable
new
friendships,
and
explosions
of
personal
realizations
of
myself
and
the
grand
world
around
me,
I
was
ready
to
come
home.
I
returned
to
exquisite
and
graceful
Vienna
before
flying
back,
and
what
made
it
easy
to
leave
was
the
absence
of
everyone
who
I
had
shared
that
time
with.
I
have
learned
much
of
my
capabilities
as
a
student,
as
a
traveler,
and
especially
as
a
writer.
As
I
read
back
on
my
journal
of
the
past
months,
I
am
satisfied
that
I
have
captured
in
words,
the
surge
of
feelings
that
were
raging
through
my
heart
and
mind
at
the
time.
Most
of
all
I
am
ready
to
return
to
school
and
wholly
enjoy
my
senior
year
at
Lafayette.
Perhaps
there
will
be
some
getting
used
to,
but
overall,
I
think
I
am
prepared
to
take
what
I
have
learned
this
entire
year
and
reflect
it
in
my
work
and
in
my
relationships
with
the
new
students
I
will
be
helping
as
their
WA
this
semester.
I
have
learned
that
I
will
be
taking
charge
of
one
of
the
Engineering
VAST
courses.
I
remember
the
complaints
of
last
year's
ES
225
WA's
with
a
grin,
but
perhaps
there
will
not
be
30
students
to
a
section
this
year.
Surely
it
is
no
Chinese
culture
course,
but
I
am
sure
it
will
do,
and
I
look
forward
to
another
successful
semester.
