When
my
career
as
a
writer
began,
I
was
still
wearing
Velcro
on
my
sneakers.
As
arduous
as
it
is
for
a
young
child
to
reach
the
rewarding
point
of
being
able
to
actually
tie
shoes,
learning
to
write
is
more
so.
I
was
in
kindergarten
when,
one
day,
my
teacher
passed
out
notebooks
and
pencils.
The
notebooks
were
small,
blue,
and
flimsy,
made
of
cheap
recycled
paper.
The
pencils
were
short
and
lacked
erasers,
for
good
reason,
because
a
five
year
old
would
not
know
what
to
erase
anyway.
I
was
not
concerned
with
these
poor
writing
implements.
Although
I
knew
how
to
spell
little
but
my
own
name,
I
was
excited
to
begin
to
learn
how
to
express
myself
on
paper.
(I
had
certainly
spent
enough
time
communicating
by
talking.)
Soon,
the
classroom
was
filled
with
silence
as
twenty
kindergarteners
concentrated
on
sounding
out
words
to
fill
their
little
notebooks.
I
quickly
developed
my
own
method
of
writing
due
to
misunderstood
instructions.
At
one
point,
my
teacher
attempted
to
explain
why
some
words
were
joined
by
hyphens.
I
did
not
understand
her
explanation,
and
I
was
concerned
I
would
leave
one
out
when
it
was
necessary,
so
I
began
placing
them
after
each
word.
My
sentences
were
peculiar
strings
of
adjoined,
bizarrely
spelled
words
that
could
only
have
originated
in
the
mind
of
a
five-year-old.
The
following
year,
my
writing
advanced
when
my
teacher
provided
her
students
with
more
sophisticated
notebooks
and
informed
me
that
I
need
not
join
every
word
with
a
hyphen.
The
teacher
would
frequently
have
the
class
write
in
our
journals.
We
had
the
freedom
to
express
ourselves
on
whatever
we
wanted.
In
second
grade,
I
had
to
learn
to
adjust
to
write
based
on
assignments,
not
just
journal
entries.
That
year,
construction
was
being
done
on
my
elementary
school.
My
teacher
took
the
class
to
see
the
site
outside.
When
we
returned
to
the
classroom,
we
were
instructed
to
write.
Because
my
prior
writing
assignments
had
been
on
topics
of
my
own
discretion,
I
assumed
this
assignment
was
the
same
and
began
to
write
as
the
teacher
provided
instructions.
I
wrote
about
my
family's
new
puppy,
Dusty.
Several
weeks
later,
after
the
annual
parent-teacher
conferences,
my
parents
returned
home
from
their
meeting
with
my
teacher
to
announce
that
while
my
teacher
was
impressed
with
the
quality
of
my
writing,
specifically
referring
to
the
essay
about
Dusty,
she
was
disappointed
in
my
inability
to
pay
attention
to
instructions.
I
was
assigned
to
write
another
paper
for
failing
to
adhere
to
the
original
assignment,
which
was
to
write
about
what
we
observed
at
the
construction
site.
At
this
point,
I
had
determined
that
writing
was
enjoyable,
and
in
addition,
I
was
pleased
that
my
ability
had
been
praised.
I
did
not
mind
that
I
had
my
first
official
writing
assignment.
My
next
memorable
writing
experience
occurred
a
year
or
so
later.
I
had
a
teacher
who
I
liked
very
much
because
each
day
she
would
provide
us
with
time
to
write.
One
assignment
was
to
write
about
our
summer
vacations.
I
wrote
about
the
past
summer's
family
vacation
to
Disney
World.
I
do
not
recall
what
the
teacher
thought
of
the
paper,
but
I
received
enough
gratification
from
my
classmates,
who
were
thoroughly
impressed
by
the
length
of
my
paper,
which
surpassed
theirs
by
about
thirty-seven
pages.
It
began
to
be
a
spectacle
around
page
ten.
My
friends'
amazement
with
the
length
of
my
paper
was
inspiring,
and
fueled
my
motivation
to
write
more.
I
pressed
myself
to
incorporate
lengthy
descriptions,
from
the
seating
arrangement
on
the
airplane
to
what
the
restrooms
looked
like.
I
realized
that
the
more
elaborate
my
descriptions,
the
longer
the
paper
would
be,
so
I
took
it
upon
myself
to
be
as
descriptive
as
possible.
By
the
time
the
school
year
wound
down,
I
reached
page
forty,
and
my
family
and
I
had
not
even
stepped
off
the
plane.
In
retrospect,
I
know
that
even
though
my
main
goal
was
to
show
off
by
writing
a
paper
that
was
longer
than
anyone
else's
in
the
class,
I
had
inadvertently
created
an
exercise
to
push
myself
to
be
as
clear
as
possible.
This
is
something
that
I
have
been
striving
to
do
in
all
of
my
writing
since
then.
This
was
when
I
began
writing
during
my
free
time.
I
would
spend
evenings
with
a
pad
and
pen
in
hand,
weaving
a
tale
to
amuse
myself.
I
would
accompany
my
family
in
front
of
the
television,
scrunch
myself
into
a
comer
of
the
couch,
and
lose
myself
in
my
writing.
My
parents
never
understood
how
I
could
drown
out
the
surrounding
sounds.
They
would
encourage
me
to
go
someplace
quiet,
but
it
did
not
matter.
Nothing
distracted
me.
When
I
was
a
little
older,
I
stopped
writing
stories
for
fun
as
my
interests
shifted
to
journal
writing.
The
summer
I
turned
fourteen,
I
started
writing
entries
in
a
purple
lined
notebook.
I
wrote
the
first
entry
my
first
night
at
sleep-away
camp.
The
previous
summer,
my
best
friend
at
camp
began
keeping
a
journal,
which
inspired
me
to
do
the
same.
She
was
a
witty,
funny,
likeable
girl,
and
I
respected
everything
she
did.
So
the
summer
after
she
started
writing
in
a
journal,
I
did
too.
Each
evening,
when
the
last
of
our
bunkmates
would
drift
off
to
sleep,
the
two
of
us,
whose
beds
were
side
by
side,
would
stop
whispering,
switch
on
our
flashlights
and
begin
writing,
in
spite
of
the
pestering
mosquitoes
that
would
invade
the
beam
of
light
cast
on
the
page.
Aside
from
attempting
to
emulate
my
friend,
an
additional
reason
I
began
writing
that
summer
was
because
camp
was
my
favorite
place
in
the
world,
and
I
wanted
to
remember
everything
happened
there.
The
camp
was
beautiful,
nestled
in
the
heart
of
the
Berkshires,
on
property
next
to
a
lake
guarded
by
surrounding
mountains.
The
girls
who
I
shared
a
cabin
with
were
my
best
friends,
a
group
of
fun-loving
kids
always
prepared
for
an
adventure
or
mild
trouble
making.
I
wanted
to
document
every
moment
in
descriptions
that
pictures
could
not
capture.
Seven
and
a
half
journals
later,
I
am
still
avidly
at
it.
I
have
known
for
years
that
I
want
writing
to
be
a
major
part
of
my
future
career.
Writing
on
a
daily
basis
not
only
provides
practice,
but
it
also
enables
me
to
refer
back
to
years
of
casual
writing
and
gage
my
progress.
In
doing
so,
I
gain
confidence
in
my
ability
to
write.
Besides,
it
is
satisfying
to
see
seven
and
a
half
notebooks
filled
with
work
that
I
produced.
My
journals
fueled
my
creativity
during
a
time
in
school
when
certain
academic
classes
did
Throughout
high
school,
until
I
reached
my
senior
year,
my
writing
consisted
of
some
research
papers
and
many
thesis-based
expository
essays
on
novels
or
plays
that
I
studied
in
English
classes.
The
most
significant
writing
I
did
during
those
years,
however,
was
in
fact
not
related
at
all
to
academics.
My
early
high
school
years
were
a
time
of
emotional
and
personal
growth.
That
period
of
life
is
often
marked
by
some
turbulence
as
kids
strive
to
gain
more
independence
from
their
parents.
I
spent
a
considerable
amount
of
time
convincing
mine
for
a
later
curfew
or
permission
for
other
activities
that
I
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
participate
in
previously.
Often,
we
would
disagree
and
arguments
would
erupt.
I
discovered
quickly
that
earning
a
favorable
response
from
my
parents
was
unlikely
when
I
had
steam
blowing
from
my
ears
and
bitter
words
flowing
from
my
mouth.
I
realized
that
for
me,
speaking,
or
arguing,
was
not
a
productive
way
to
communicate
with
them.
So
I
turned
to
writing
as
an
alternative.
I
have
written
several
well-timed
letters
to
my
parents
that
have
succeeded
where
rhetoric
would
not.
Through
these
letters
I
would
explain
in
great
detail
how
I
felt.
Because
my
perspective
was
being
read,
no
one
had
the
opportunity
to
interrupt
and
therefore
further
anger
anyone
else.
Writing
for
me
had
become
a
way
of
communicating
my
feelings
to
myself
in
my
journals
long
ago.
Now
I
realized
I
could
use
writing
to
express
myself
to
others
as
well.
My
writing
experiences
during
senior
year
were
more
eventful,
which
certainly
was
beneficial
for
preparing
me
for
the
writing
I
would
be
doing
in
college.
I
characterize
my
writing
that
year
by
three
specific
papers.
The
first
paper
was
an
assignment
based
on
the
reading
I
did
in
class
on
a
play.
I
do
not
even
remember
the
play
(though
I
did
read
it)
because
I
did
not
actually
do
the
assignment.
I
felt
uninspired
by
the
topic
at
hand,
and
could
not
think
of
material
to
write
about.
Instead,
I
went
to
my
teacher
and
asked
if
I
could
write
about
the
past
summer
I
spent
in
Alaska.
He
agreed.
To
this
day,
it
is
the
most
descriptive
and
emotive
paper
I
have
ever
written.
It
was
powerful
and
heartfelt.
I
had
never
before
had
the
chance
to
write
that
way,
and
I
have
not
had
the
opportunity
to
do
something
like
it
again,
so
I
am
glad
I
opted
to
deviate
from
the
original
assignment.
The
second
paper
I
wrote
senior
year
was
for
my
Lafayette
application
essay.
Since
I
was
not
inspired
by
any
of
the
topics
suggested
in
the
application,
I
chose
one
of
my
own.
One
day,
while
petting
Dusty,
a
light
bulb
went
off.
I
began
thinking
how
she
is
more
popular
than
any
person
I
have
ever
known.
Everyone
who
comes
to
my
house
enjoys
spending
time
with
her,
and
people
on
the
street
comment
on
what
a
nice
dog
she
is.
As
I
began
to
identify
the
qualities
that
made
her
so
likeable
-
she's
friendly,
has
ceaseless
patience
and
is
tenaciously
loyal
-1
realized
that
she
is
my
role
model.
I
was
accepted
to
Lafayette
early
decision
with
an
essay
on
how
I
aspire
to
be
more
like
a
miniature
poodle.
I
mark
that
Dusty
essay
as
a
closure
to
a
certain
period
of
my
writing.
I
figured
that
I
would
no
longer
have
the
flexibility
to
choose
my
own
topics
of
writing
based
solely
on
my
inspiration,
so,
as
I
did
in
second
grade,
I
wrote
another
paper
about
my
dog,
the
topic
of
my
choice.
The
other
memorable
paper
I
wrote
that
year
was
one
of
my
first
expository
essays
that
involved
intensive
research.
I
wrote
it
on
Nathaniel
Hawthorne's
The
Scarlet
Letter.
The
extensive
amount
of
time
I
devoted
to
research,
note
taking,
and
brainpower
used
to
ponder
symbolism,
connections,
and
irony
in
the
novel
was
unparalleled
by
any
prior
writing
experiences.
The
challenge
of
this
experience
helped
prepare
me
for
writing
in
college.
As
I
progressed
through
Freshman
year
at
Lafayette,
I
had
an
easier
time
with
the
topics
that
were
assigned
to
me
as
I
figured
out
ways
to
make
writing
in
a
more
intense
environment
a
little
less
serious.
I
began
giving
my
papers
temporary
titles
that
would
keep
me
entertained
until
the
last
moment
before
printing
out
the
final
copy.
My
most
famous
title
was
for
a
Gulliver's
Travels.
I
was
not
pleased
about
having
to
write
a
seven-page
essay
about
it.
I
used
the
title
as
a
means
to
vent
my
frustration
about
this
paper
that
was
not
easy
for
me
to
write.
(I
will
not
disclose
the
temporary
title
for
this
paper.)
This
paper
was
a
major
milestone
in
my
writing.
It
was
a
thesis-based
paper
that
I
began
writing
as
I
always
had
in
high
school.
I
came
up
with
a
thesis,
collected
quotes
to
support
my
thesis,
then
wrote
a
standard,
generic
outline.
I
was
not
satisfied
with
the
product
of
the
outline;
I
felt
it
would
not
evolve
into
a
strong
paper,
so
I
brought
it
to
my
professor
and
requested
his
advice.
He
said
all
of
my
ideas
were
solid,
but
why
not
reorganize
them?
I
was
shocked.
Since
I
had
structured
the
paper
in
a
way
that
had
always
earned
me
A's
in
high
school,
I
could
not
understand
why
I
was
being
encouraged
to
try
something
different.
But
that
is
exactly
what
he
told
me
to
do.
If
this
method
was
not
working
for
this
paper,
I
should
do
something
else.
I
did
not
know
where
to
begin.
My
professor
told
me
to
be
creative.
Previously,
I
had
not
realized
I
could
be
creative
in
a
thesis
essay
with
a
specific
topic.
Now
I
know
that
creativity
is
not
limited
to
the
assigned
topic,
but
instead
the
way
the
paper
is
written.
I
no
longer
need
to
ignore
a
teacher's
assignment
in
order
to
have
the
freedom
to
express
myself
as
I
had
in
elementary
school
and
high
school.
I
have
learned
to
take
the
topic
assigned
to
me
and
add
my
own
style
and
persona
to
it.
Like
the
leap
of
sophistication
from
Velcro
to
laces,
my
writing
has
evolved.
