Even
at
the
beginning,
in
the
first
grade,
writing
was
a
frustration
for
me.
I
remember
what
it
was
like
trying
to
write
when
pencils
were
the
implements
of
choice.
I
was
left-handed
and
my
penmanship
was
none
too
stellar.
That
meant
that
everything
my
pencil
scrawled
instantly
faded
under
the
smearing
plow
of
my
palm.
In
addition,
I
had
a
spelling
mental
block
to
rival
any
of
the
"Hooked
on
Phonics"
parodies
you
might
have
seen.
My
teachers
all
thought
I
had
wonderful
ideas
but
few
of
these
thoughts
could
reach
the
paper.
I
was
always
embarrassed
by
the
presentation
of
my
work.
I
remember
being
in
fifth
grade
sitting
in
my
room
the
night
before
a
paper
was
due
writing
draft
after
draft
because
I
could
not
get
through
an
entire
page
without
any
errors.
Even
though,
at
this
point,
revisions
were
long
since
done
with,
I
could
not
produce
a
copy
of
my
work
for
which
I
could
feel
pride.
The
embarrassment
I
felt
over
my
unsightly
work
manifested
itself
as
a
fear.
I
remember
having
a
few
small
piles
of
paper
hoarded
away
under
my
bed.
I
recall
thinking
how
precious
that
paper
was
because
anything
could
be
put
on
it,
but
the
paper
remained
blank
and
remains
blank
to
this
day
because
I
feared
"messing
it
up"
with
the
things
I
would
put
on
it.
For
these
reasons
writing
did
not
become
an
effective
or
pleasant
way
for
me
to
express
myself
until
much
later.
My
writing
experience
in
grade
school
was
minimal.
I
did
what
my
classes
required,
but
that
was
very
little
indeed.
English
grammar
was
never
something
taken
too
seriously
by
most
of
my
grade
school
teachers.
A
few
workbook
pages
would
usually
suffice
for
a
grammar
lesson,
and
this
was
often
independent
learning
because
the
workbooks
were
self-explanatory,
but
it
meant
that
very
few
of
us
were
solidly
grounded
in
grammatical
rules
and
constructions.
Even
though
the
lessons
came
easy
to
me
I
never
received
enough
practice
in
what
I
learned
to
consider
myself
competent.
Although
many
of
my
friends
and
classmates
kept
journals
for
their
writing,
I
never
wrote
for
fun
and,
in
truth,
I
never
read
for
fun
either.
The
first
book
I
remember
reading
on
my
own
for
entertainment
was
"The
Hobbit."
My
mother
suggested
(rather
forcefully
as
I
recall)
that
I
try
this
book.
She
said
that
she
thought
it
was
different
and
that
I
might
enjoy
it.
She
was
absolutely
correct.
I
loved
it,
and
that
has
made
all
the
difference.
For
once
I
found
myself
wanting
to
express
something.
Feelings
of
nostalgia,
romance,
chivalry
and
adventure
became
prevalent
in
my
mind,
and
I
needed
to
give
them
voice.
This
was
the
sixth
grade
and
my
homeroom
teacher
was
an
accomplished
artist.
Because
of
her
influence
I
took
up
drawing
as
a
way
of
expressing
myself.
I
would
occasionally
write
small
blurbs
as
explanation
for
my
drawings,
but,
at
this
point,
I
still
undertook
no
serious
writing
efforts
for
myself.
When
I
started
high
school,
I
was
placed
in
a
Latin
course.
I
was
excited
by
its
prospects:
it
was
ancient,
romantic,
artistic
and
intellectual,
as
well
as
beautifully
expressive.
More
than
for
the
feelings
it
evoked,
Latin
was
important
for
the
opportunity
it
afforded
me
to
finally
learn
well
all
the
English
grammar
that
I
had
been
missing.
I
can
truly
say
that
all
the
grammar
I
use
today,
I
know
from
my
Latin
classes.
Besides
providing
the
grammatical
foundation
I
lacked,
being
in
that
Latin
class
-
an
extra
class
at
my
school
-
meant
that
I
got
out
of
school
later
than
all
my
friends
and
I
could
not
get
a
ride
home
with
them,
or
even
walk
home
with
company.
The
walk
home
was
a
half
hour
a
day
of
solitary
dead
time
that
my
boredom
required
me
to
fill.
At
some
point
I
began
making
little
rhymes
just
to
pass
the
time.
These
rhymes
were
at
first,
meaningless
and
served
only
to
ease
my
boredom,
but
soon
they
began
to
center
on
what
I
was
feeling
at
the
time.
By
sophomore
year,
(I
was
in
Latin
II,
so
I
still
got
out
later
than
all
those
with
whom
I
might
have
walked
home.)
I
was
rhyming
about
my
girlfriend
and
about
the
way
I
felt
for
her.
It
was
at
this
point,
when
the
rhymes
had
taken
on
some
emotional
significance,
that
I
began
to
write
down
those
that
I
thought
were
my
best.
At
first
I
only
wrote
them
on
flash
cards
because
they
were
easy
to
keep
in
my
pocket
as
I
walked.
Now,
having
written
my
rhymes,
and
no
longer
depending
on
my
memory
alone
for
editing
and
addition,
I
could
make
longer
and
better
constructed
rhymes.
They
could
be
less
simple
and
more
meaningful.
I
wrote
now
to
capture
feelings
and
times
in
my
life.
As
other
people
may
have
kept
journals
or
photo
albums,
I
kept
my
poems.
I
added
the
rhymes
(at
this
point,
I
termed
them
poems)
to
my
book
of
drawing.
Both
were
of
a
similar
design,
expressions
of
the
feelings
books
(at
this
point
I
was
reading
more
than
ever)
such
as
"The
Hobbit"
had
awakened
in
me,
so
the
poems
and
drawings
integrated
well.
I
began,
around
this
time,
to
associate
with
a
new
group
of
friends,
friends
who
shared
both
my
classes
and
my
newfound
interest
in
expression.
I
no
longer
wrote
only
out
of
boredom,
but
to
say
what
I
was
thinking.
I
drew
less
and
switched
from
flashcards
to
notebooks.
My
books
became
filled
with
words.
My
words
were
very
private
to
me.
My
old
friends
wouldn't
have
understood,
and
I
was
hesitant
to
trust
with
my
treasures
even
those
friends
who
were
likeminded.
One
night,
I
had
made
plans
to
spend
time
with
a
friend,
Nelson,
with
whom
I
had
become
very
close,
partly
by
sharing
our
writing
experiences.
Although
we
discussed
these
things,
we
had
not
until
that
night
seen
any
of
each
other's
work.
That
was
the
first
time
I
had
shared
any
of
my
writing
with
anyone
and
I
loved
the
feeling.
He
took
true
interest
in
what
I
said,
critiqued
and
commented
on
my
methods,
and
for
him
I
did
likewise.
I
no
longer
wrote
simply
as
a
reminder
for
myself
of
how
I
felt
at
any
one
point
in
my
life,
but
to
communicate
unhindered
with
Nelson
and
anyone
else
who
was
interested.
This
shift
of
focus
and
change
of
intent
happened
because
of
the
reception
I
got
on
that
first
night.
By
junior
year
of
high
school
I
was
submitting
my
writing
to
contests.
I
was
even
published
by
one
of
them.
My
other
interests
were
also
changing.
I
had
been
for
over
a
year
at
that
point,
a
member
of
stage
screw.
Building
sets
for
musicals
was
my
responsibility.
I
decided
around
this
time
that
I
wanted
to
be
in
the
show,
and
so
I
made
my
move
from
behind
scenes
to
front
and
center
stage.
This
move
from
the
physical
work
to
the
artistic
bolstered
my
writing
and
my
confidence.
I
began
to
write
things
other
than
poems.
In
letters
and
essays
I
was
capable
of
more
explicit
expression
-
I
could
say
what
I
meant
without
being
cryptic,
as
I
felt
my
poems
often
were.
As
I
became
more
serious
about
my
writing,
my
shortcomings
grieved
me
all
the
more.
I
had
worked
to
overcome
the
problems
of
my
grade
school
writing.
Typing
on
a
computer
made
things
legible
and
easier
to
organize,
but
it
also
made
my
writing
feel
impersonal,
so,
for
my
casual
writing
I
stuck
with
pen
and
paper
and
learned
through
a
conscious
effort
to
use
them
well
enough.
I'm
not
as
fearful
of
a
blank
page
as
I
used
to
be,
mostly
because
I've
become
accustomed
to
producing
both
things
I
find
wonderful
and
things
that
are
trash.
I
learned
to
take
the
bad
with
the
good
as
a
learning
experience.
Other
shortcomings
followed.
I
found
that
my
early
writings
of
which
I
had
been
so
proud
were
now
sources
of
embarrassment
because
my
ideas
seemed
stale
and
my
expression
commonplace.
I
found
it
hard
to
continue
writing
when
I
knew
that,
at
this
point
in
my
life,
things
were
changing
so
quickly
that
I
could
scarcely
finish
a
piece
before
I
found
my
inspirations
dull.
Rather
than
putting
my
changing
and
personal
thoughts
to
paper,
I
discussed
them
when
I
could.
It
is
easier
to
allow
your
thoughts
to
change
and
to
let
go
of
the
old
ones
when
you
haven't
committed
to
them
in
writing--you
feel
like
less
of
a
traitor
to
yourself.
It
might
be
that,
as
my
experience
as
a
reader
grew,
I
expected
my
proficiency
as
a
writer
to
keep
up.
When
it
did
not,
I
felt
that
my
writing
was
cheap.
These
perceived
inadequacies
applied
mostly
to
my
personal
writings.
I
am,
In
general,
much
more
confident
with
my
formal
writing.
My
parents
never
knew
much
about
my
private
writings
and
saw
only
some
of
what
I
produced
for
school.
When
it
came
time
for
college
applications,
we
took
on
the
task
together.
In
truth
I
needed
their
guidance
greatly.
When
they
read
my
essays,
they
were
shocked.
They
hadn't
known
of
what
I
was
capable.
My
father,
an
avid
reader,
actually
told
me,
from
those
samples
alone,
that
he
thought
I
could
be
a
journalist
someday.
His
confidence
and
that
of
my
high
school
teachers
and
college
professors
has
helped
me
to
explore
more
thoroughly
as
I
write,
endeavoring
never
to
leave
my
reader
in
suspense
by
producing
an
expectation
and
leaving
it
unfulfilled,
or
to
bore
my
reader
with
superfluous
language
that
distracts
from
my
intention.
My
technique
for
accomplishing
these
goals
is,
I
think,
peculiar.
To
organize
my
thoughts,
I
need
to
know
clearly
where
I
want
to
go
with
a
paper
and
how
one
thought
connects
to
the
rest
in
sequence.
For
me,
becoming
this
familiar
with
my
direction
before
having
written
anything
has
been
impossible
because
writing
about
a
thought
is
the
best
way
for
me
to
analyze
it.
I
usually
do
very
little
prewriting,
laying
out
only
the
very
basics
of
what
I
want
to
cover.
Then
I
write.
My
ideas
flesh
themselves
out
a
great
deal
better
when
they
are
in
front
of
me
than
when
they
are
abstracted.
As
I
write,
I
discover
the
connections
I
need
to
establish.
Then,
with
this
knowledge
I
begin
the
whole
paper
again.
Each
time
I
begin
again
on
the
one
paper
I
have
made
myself
more
sure
of
how
I
will
direct
it
and
of
what
I
need
to
say
and
where
it
needs
to
be.
Drafting
in
this
way,
two
or
three
rewrites
will
usually
produce
a
tightly
knitted
structure
that
is
much
more
fluid
and
unblemished
than
I
can
produce
with
standard
drafting.
I
understand
that
with
every
word
and
nuance
of
phrase
a
writer
manipulates
a
multitude
of
variables.
My
hope
is
that
writing
this
way
and
working
with
the
Writing
Associate
program
I
will
come
to
understand
what
those
variables
are
and
how
my
audience
is
affected
by
them,
so
that
my
writing
can
achieve
a
more
meaningful
whole.
Although
my
frustrations
have
made
it
appear
at
times
that
my
pen
was
predestined
for
silence,
it
has
occurred
to
me
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
I
think
like
a
writer,
or
at
least
I
think
like
I
write.
What
I
mean
is
that,
whenever
I
think
about
some
course
of
events,
some
communication,
some
daydream,
or
some
thought
-
whenever
I
think
of
anything
at
all
-
I
think
of
it
as
I
would
write
it.
Effectively
my
thinking
voice
or
internal
monologue
is
the
same
as
my
writing
voice.
As
I
have
said
the
best
and
perhaps
only
way
for
me
to
really
think
is
to
write.
I
cannot
honestly
say
that,
if
told
to
go
"think"
about
something,
I
could
do
it
effectively
without
pen
and
paper.
That
revelation
has
come
to
me
through
my
college
writing.
I
have
wasted
a
great
deal
of
time
telling
myself
that
I'm
thinking
about
what
I
want
to
say,
but
I
think
now
that
the
best
way
for
me
to
do
that
is
to
lay
out
my
initial
impulse
and
then
evaluate
it.
This
may
be
either
a
flaw
in
my
writing
or
a
shortcoming
of
my
thinking,
but
because
the
phenomenon
exists
nonetheless,
some
part
of
me
is
left
to
believe
that
there
may
be
a
writer
in
me
after-all.
