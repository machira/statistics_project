Throughout
my
entire
career
at
Hamilton
Central
School,
I
have
completed
a
myriad
of
writing
assignments.
These
assignments
have
ranged
from
research
papers
to
analyses
of
books
to
the
malign
effects
of
smoking
on
the
lower
bronchial
portion
of
the
human
respiratory
system.
But
my
first
true
form
of
writing
came
through
pure
inspiration.
It
was
not
assigned
and
did
not
have
a
deadline.
I
wrote
because
I
wanted
to
write.
That
was
my
very
first
writing
act.
I
was
thirteen
years
old
and
my
adventurous
spirit
was
flowing
through
my
body
like
the
hormones
of
an
eighteen-year
old.
Maybe
it
was
just
my
nature
or
maybe
it
was
because
I
was
growing
up
in
a
small
town
where
excitement
was
as
rare
as
skyscrapers
being
built,
but
searching
for
anything
that
provided
that
adrenaline
rush
became
the
object
of
my
spare
time.
Once
I
realized
that
everything
I
was
searching
for
was
right
in
my
back
yard,
exploring
this
ancient
realm
became
my
passion.
As
the
days
went
by
and
my
adventures
became
more
daring,
I
was
faced
with
the
challenge
of
entering
the
oldest,
darkest,
scariest
structure
in
the
yard.
The
Old
Barn.
Over
a
hundred
years
ago
my
house
was
a
small,
operating
farm.
The
Barn
was
the
only
part
qf
the
farm
that
remained.
It
was
too
old
and
fragile
to
park
a
car
in
it
so
my
family
used
it
to
shelter
everything
else--bikes,
equipment,
tools
and
anything
that
needed
a
place
to
be
stored.
A
night
The
Barn
was
the
most
frightening
place
I
have
ever
seen.
Having
worked
up
enough
courage
(and
accompanied
by
a
fellow
companion)
we
packed
up
our
gear
and
entered
The
Barn...during
the
day,
of
course.
After
rummaging
through
most
of
the
material
scattered
throughout
the
barn
we
came
across
a
ladder
built
on
to
the
wall
that
was
hidden
behind
a
few
planks
or
wood.
we
made
our
way
up
me
ladder
and
discovered
a
whole
new
room
above
the
main
floor.
It
was
amazing.
The
sun
was
shining
through
the
cracks
between
the
walls
providing
just
enough
light
for
us
to
realize
that
we
had
found
our
clubhouse.
This
was
every
kid's
dream.
Or
at
least
mine...somewhere
you
could
go
when
you
just
needed
to
get
away
from
everything
and
have
a
place
to
dream
and
be
to
yourself.
We
spent
months
cleaning
out
the
room
and
adding
our
own
personal
touches
to
make
it
as
comfortable
as
a
hundred
vear-old
barn
could
be.
Everyday
we
would
find
more
and
more
decorative
items
to
make
our
new
hangout
look
like
it
was
straight
our
or
a
Hollywood
movie.
Back
in
school
we
began
creative
writing
in
my
English
class.
Even
before
any
assignments
were
given
I
had
begun
a
short
story
about
The
Barn
and
our
discovery.
This
short
story
turned
into
a
thirty-page
novel
that
I
continued
to
work
on
over
the
year.
Encouraged
by
this
I
began
writing
more
ana
more
snort
stories
about
the
adventures
my
friends
and
I
would
embark
on.
Fiction
turned
into
non-fiction
and
I
soon
began
to
write
short
stories
on
my
own
time.
I
consider
these
short
stories
my
first
form
of
writing.
I
had
worked
on
writing
in
elementary
school
but
this
was
different.
I
was
captivated
and
inspired
rather
than
feeling
forced
into
completing
a
writing
assignment.
I
contribute
my
love
for
writing
to
the
fact
that
my
parents
encouraged
me
to
read
a
lot
of
books
when
I
was
young.
I
tried
to
cqpy
the
styles
of
the
books
I
was
reading
at
the
time,
which
1
believe
helped
me
to
develop
into
a
mature
writer.
The
summer
before
ninth
grade
I
read
a
book
by
Jim
Carroll,
which
sparked
my
passion
for
poetry.
Carroll
was
a
former
heroin
addict
who
grew
up
in
New
York
City
and
led
a
fascinating
life.
He
wrote
several
books
on
all
of
the
adventures
he
experienced
and
a
few
books
-containing
his
poetry.
I
also
received
a
book
of
poetry
written
by
Jim
Morrison
and
soon
after
I
began
writing
poetry
of
my
own.
I
kept
all
of
my
writings
to
myself
in
a
small
book
that
I
congealed
in
my
room.
I
entered
my
first
year
of
high
school
and
became
an
avid
reader
of
the
monthly-
published
high
school
magazine,
The
Bard.
I
never
submitted
any
of
my
own
material
until
eleventh
grade,
when
I
became
an
editor
of
the
paper.
I
had
studied
several
different
styles
of
poetry
in
my
sophomore
and
junior
years
and
formed
my
own
style
of
writing
based
on
what
I
had
studied
and
read.
I
felt
that
writing
poetry
helped
me
to
develop
a
unique,
creative
and
intelligent
writing
style
that
influenced
other
forms
of
my
writing.
My
senior
year
in
high
school
had
the
most
influence
on
my
writing.
I
was
appointed
editor
of
the
weekly
newspaper
and
monthly
literary
magazine,
I
elected
to
take
Advanced
Placement
English
and
I
had
the
opportunity
to
take
two
courses
at
Colgate
University,
which
is
located
in
my
town.
As
editor
of
both
the
newspaper
and
the
literary
magazine
I
was
presented
with
many
different
styles
of
writing.
Through
writing
more
myself
and
editing
the
writing
of
others,
I
was
able
to
improved
and
refine
my
own
writing
style.
My
position
required
me
to
work
very
closely
with
the
entire
staff.,
which
also
helped
to
develop
my
communication
skills.
The
literary
magazine
strengthened
my
artistic
side,
as
well
as
my
creative
writing
skills.
I
learned
some
things
about
editing
and
designing
layouts
and
continued
to
grow
as
a
writer.
Advanced
Placement
English
took
my
reading
and
writing
skills
to
a
higher
level.
Coupled
with
an
inspiring
teacher
and
a
well-structured
curriculum,
the
course
introduced
me
to
a
new
form
of
writing,
that
of
critical
analysis.
I
learned
a
lot
and
know
that
this
was
helping
me
to
grow
as
a
writer.
I
was
required
to
write
from
several
different
perspectives
on
the
books
we
read,
to
critique
and
to
analyze.
The
more
I
wrote,
the
more
my
writing
improved.
Taking
two
courses
at
Colgate
University
during
my
senior
year
at
high
school
was
the
best
opportunity
I
had
to
prepare
me
for
the
demands
or
college-level
courses.
The
most
effective
course
I
took
was
an
ethics
course
on
the
nature,
the
wilderness
and
the
effect
humans
on
the
environment.
This
particular
course
required
writing
several
papers
on
many
different
subjects,
each
taken
on
a
different
perspective.
The
demands
of
the
class
helped
me
to
advance
my
writing
skills
in
order
to
perform
at
a
college
level.
My
experiences
throughout
my
years
in
elementary,
middle
and
high
school
all
helped
to
form,
develop
and
improve
my
writing
style.
When
I
came
to
Lafayette
as
a
freshmen,
I
felt
confident
in
my
writing
abilities.
I
was
able
to
perform
at
the
standards
expected
while
greatly
strengthening
my
skills
with
each
paper
I
wrote.
I
applied
for
the
WA
position
to
not
only
help
others
with
their
writing,
but
as
another
step
towards
improving
my
writing
and
becoming
a
better
writer.
