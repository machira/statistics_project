Literary
Narrative
by
A.
August
27,
1995
I
cannot
quite
remember
when
my
first
writing
experience
occurred
or
even
what
it
was.
I
believe
that
it
must
have
been
positive,
for
I
do
remember
loving
to
write
even
as
a
young
child.
Even
before
writing
book
reports
for
school,
I
remember
doing
creative
writing
for
fun.
The
first
writing
that
I
remember
doing
was
in
second
grade.
I
was
eight
years
old
at
the
time
and
my
mother
had
just
given
birth
to
my
baby
brother.
I
was
excited
about
having
a
baby
brother
so
I
began
to
write
books
documenting
his
life.
They
were
essentially
nonfiction
books
describing
him
doing
things
such
as
taking
his
first
steps
and
saying
his
first
words.
However
I
did
add
some
elements
of
fiction
to
the
stories
to
make
them
more
interesting.
I
wrote
and
illustrated
four
books
for
and
about
my
brother
Gregory.
I
started
the
first
one
in
second
grade
when
he
was
born,
and
proceeded
to
write
three
more
over
the
course
of
the
next
year.
Looking
back
at
my
four
books
I
can
see
now
that
while
I
merely
saw
them
as
fun
at
the
time,
they
were
very
important
steps
in
the
development
of
my
writing
career.
I
have
always
enjoyed
creative
writing
and
I
believe
that
my
interest
in
that
area
stems
from
my
first
experiences
being
positive
ones.
Since
that
time
I
have
written
other
stories
on
my
own
without
any
prompting.
The
next
writing
experience
that
sticks
in
my
mind
occurred
in
either
fifth
or
sixth
grade.
I
am
unable
to
remember
which
grade
because
I
had
the
same
English
teacher
for
both
years.
I
remember
writing
a
story
about
a
news
reporter
that
had
been
sent
to
an
old,
deserted
mansion
that
was
the
sight
of
strange
murder
years
earlier.
The
story
had
ghost
like
attributes
to
it
and
the
plot
became
complicated
as
the
reader
discovers
that
the
reporter
has
family
ties
to
the
mysterious
house
and
suspicious
motives.
The
end
leaves
the
reader
hanging,
making
them
wonder
if
the
house
is
truly
haunted,
or
if
the
reporter
has
merely
lost
his
mind.
After
finishing
the
story
I
took
it
to
school
and
showed
it
to
my
English
teacher.
He
showed
the
story
to
some
other
teachers
and
brought
it
back
to
me
with
a
host
of
compliments.
I
don't
know
why
I
decided
to
write
the
story
but
I'm
sure
that
my
teacher
thought
that
I
was
destined
to
be
the
next
Stephen
King!
I
always
wrote
my
papers
and
book
reports
by
hand
up
until
high
school,
so
writing
several
drafts
of
that
story
must
have
taken
a
considerable
amount
of
time.
As
far
back
as
I
can
remember
I
always
have
received
praise
about
my
writing.
Whether
it
was
from
teachers
or
from
my
parents,
I
tended
to
earn
praise
from
others
and
thus
gained
a
lot
of
confidence
in
my
writing
ability.
My
mother
was
an
English
major
in
college
and
has
always
loved
to
write,
so
I
have
always
had
a
strong
writing
support
group
behind
me.
When
I
left
elementary
school
for
junior
high
school
in
seventh
grade
I
knew
that
I
could
write
well
and
based
on
my
past
experiences
I
wrote
with
confidence.
In
seventh
grade
I
was
elated
when
my
English
teacher,
Ms.
Quigley
formally
exposed
us
to
creative
writing.
We
turned
in
at
least
one
piece
of
work
to
her
a
month.
During
that
month
we
wrote
several
drafts,
had
peer
conferences
with
other
students
in
the
class,
and
met
with
her
before
submitting
a
final
draft.
She
encouraged
us
to
let
our
imaginations
soar,
by
composing
literature
in
any
form
that
we
felt
comfortable
with.
Some
people
wrote
poems
and
comedies,
while
others
of
us
wrote
adventure
stories.
I
wrote
terrible
comedies
and
have
never
been
very
comfortable
with
poetry,
so
I
became
very
content
with
writing
mysteries
and
adventure
stories.
I
recreated
the
murder
story
that
I
first
conceived
in
elementary
school,
and
wrote
a
trilogy
of
Indiana
Jones
chronicles.
I
even
wrote
a
science
fiction
story
that
resembled
an
H.G.
Wells
type
of
social
commentary.
I
had
Ms.
Quigley
in
both
seventh
and
eighth
grades
so
I
became
very
comfortable
composing
creative
writing.
Besides
creative
writing
I
also
enjoyed
writing
book
reports.
I
have
always
loved
reading,
which
I
attribute
to
parents
who
always
left
all
sorts
of
books
lying
around
the
house.
Because
I
became
so
accustomed
to
reading
so
much
as
a
child,
I
think
that
my
love
of
writing
became
almost
second
nature
to
me.
I
have
been
very
lucky
in
that
every
time
I
have
passed
from
one
school
system
to
the
next,
I
have
always
had
a
smooth
transition
in
writing.
By
my
reading
the
books
I
did
in
junior
high
for
book
reports,
such
as
The
Picture
of
Dorian
Gray,
The
Three
Musketeers,
and
Flowers
for
Algernon
I
broadened
my
mind
and
thus
greatly
expanded
my
writing
vocabulary.
Because
I
often
read
books
above
my
reading
level
my
writing
vocabulary
and
ability
constantly
increased.
I
unknowingly
prepared
myself
for
the
types
of
books
that
I
had
to
read
in
high
school
and
will
have
to
read
in
the
future
for
my
college
classes.
Upon
entering
high
school
I
was
nervous
that
my
writing
abilities
were
not
refined
enough,
but
I
soon
regained
my
confidence.
I
have
always
had
positive
reinforcement
and
feedback
from
my
instructors
and
that
continued
in
high
school.
I
did
not
have
many
opportunities
to
explore
creative
writing
in
high
school,
but
I
enjoyed
them
when
they
did
arise.
Rather,
my
freshman
year
I
was
introduced
to
the
research
paper.
Like
the
rest
of
my
classmates,
I
was
at
first
intimidated
at
the
prospect
of
creating
a
research
paper.
It
was
a
writing
form
that
I
had
no
prior
knowledge
of
and
thus
my
nervousness
arose
.
My
fears
soon
subsided
after
my
sophomore
year
and
I
survived
Ms.
Maturo's
European
history
class.
In
her
class
we
spent
an
entire
semester
researching,
creating
and
polishing
a
term
paper.
It
was
not
an
easy
semester
to
say
the
least
as
we
perfected
the
formidable
art
of
note
cards
and
learned
when
and
how
to
use
footnotes.
Since
Ms.
Maturo's
class
I
have
yet
to
be
intimidated
by
the
prospect
of
doing
a
research
paper.
I
not
only
felt
confident
enough
to
do
term
papers
for
my
future
history
and
English
classes
in
high
school,
but
her
class
also
prepared
me
to
do
papers
in
college.
Ms.
Maturo
showed
me
how
to
construct
the
proper
research
paper,
but
one
of
my
English
teachers,
Mr.
Kotak,
and
a
history
teacher,
Mr.
Bruneau
were
also
powerful
influences
on
me.
Ms.
Maturo
prepared
me
to
write
research
papers
for
their
classes,
but
they
taught
me
how
to
expand
my
reading
and
interpretation
skills.
In
Mr.
Kotak's
English
class
my
junior
year
I
was
exposed
to
poetry
and
various
other
literary
forms.
While
learning
how
to
read,
interpret,
and
understand
different
literary
styles,
I
also
learned
how
to
truly
write
analytical
papers.
In
Mr.
Bruneau's
American
History
class
my
junior
year
I
learned
how
to
write
a
different
type
of
analytical
paper.
In
English
classes
I
learned
how
to
interpret
a
literary
work
and
express
those
thoughts
in
words.
Often
the
writer
of
the
work
had
a
specific
point
or
theme
that
they
wanted
the
reader
to
find.
However,
when
dealing
with
why
a
particular
event
in
history
occurred,
the
motives
of
those
involved
are
often
very
complicated
and
are
harder
to
pinpoint.
I
found
that
often
there
was
not
a
concise
answer,
as
was
often
the
case
with
literature.
I
then
had
to
turn
my
interpretation
of
an
event
into
a
persuasive
essay.
In
such
a
way
I
found
a
new
analytical
form
of
writing
in
my
history
class
which
I
found
fascinating.
By
expanding
my
analyzing
and
interpreting
skills
I
not
only
became
a
better
reader
but
also
a
much
better
writer.
By
the
time
I
graduated
high
school
and
left
for
college
I
had
been
prepared
sufficiently
to
write
at
a
collegiate
level.
My
preparation
began
as
a
toddler
when
my
parents
started
reading
stories
to
me
every
evening
before
bed
and
continued
in
first
grade
when
it
took
me
eight
weeks
to
read
Ms.
Bianca
and
the
Salt
Mines.
I
have
loved
reading
books
for
as
long
as
I
can
remember,
and
that
love
has
allowed
me
to
become
the
writer
that
I
am
now.
My
teachers
encouraged
reading
from
a
young
age,
and
at
home
my
parents
strongly
reinforced
that
idea.
I
believe
that
because
I
have
always
enjoyed
reading,
I
never
grew
up
afraid
of
words
and
was
always
able
to
express
my
thoughts
through
them.
Writing
has
never
intimidated
me
and
I
credit
the
influence
of
my
parents
above
all
for
that.
Once
I
arrived
on
the
college
campus
I
did
worry
that
my
writing
would
not
be
adequate
to
my
professors'
standards,
but
I
soon
discovered
that
my
fears
were
not
justified.
I
found
that
the
whole
of
my
writing
career
had
prepared
me
well
for
college.
While
writing
at
Lafayette
College
has
challenged
me,
I
have
yet
to
experience
of
being
inadequately
prepared
to
successfully
complete
a
writing
task.
My
writing
ability
has
yet
to
be
seriously
challenged
and
so
my
confidence
in
my
writing
ability
has
yet
to
be
shaken.
I
have
noticed
that
my
writing
capabilities
have
noticeably
increased
upon
entering
Lafayette.
During
the
second
semester
of
my
freshman
year
I
had
a
Civil
War
class
in
which
I
read
several
interesting
books.
One
in
particular
did
not
even
concern
the
Civil
War,
but
rather
was
one
of
those
books
one
reads
to
understand
the
nature
of
history
itself
and
why
it
is
studied.
It
is
one
of
those
books
that
one
does
not
enjoy
reading
at
the
time
but
one
finds
that
it
greatly
broadens
one's
horizons
in
the
long
run.
The
book
helped
me
as
a
writer
because
it
broadened
me
as
a
reader.
It
raised
questions
that
I
must
consider
when
analyzing
anything
that
I
read,
whether
it
is
an
interpretation
of
a
historical
event
or
a
science
fiction
story.
Now
that
I
have
a
better
idea
of
what
questions
to
ask,
I
am
better
able
to
answer
those
questions
effectively
in
my
writing.
In
the
end
the
sum
of
all
my
writing
experiences
has
been
very
positive.
In
every
writing
class
that
I
have
had
in
the
past
I
have
become
a
better
analytical
reader,
and
as
a
result
I
have
been
able
to
refine
my
writing
skills.
I
realize
that
I
have
much
more
to
learn,
but
I
understand
how
I
came
to
be
the
writer
I
am
now.
My
love
of
reading
started
young
and
as
a
result
I
explored
writing
on
my
own
at
a
young
age.
In
short
I
see
my
first
major
writing
experience
of
writing
those
four
books
for
my
brother
as
being
directly
connected
to
all
of
my
subsequent
writing
experiences.
As
in
anatomical
and
physiological
terms
where
we
are
a
sum
of
interconnecting
parts
that
must
function
together,
my
writing
career
is
a
series
of
events
that
are
dependent
on
each
other
for
progress.
I
can
head
into
my
future
writing
experiences
knowing
exactly
what
my
writing
foundation
is
and
why
it
developed
in
the
manner
that
it
did.
