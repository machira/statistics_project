Writing
Narrative
8/8/2008
Very
early
in
my
life,
my
family
owned
an
electric
typewriter.
My
mother
was
(and
still
is)
an
avid
fiction
writer,
so,
since
my
family
did
not
purchase
a
personal
computer
until
I
was
in
kindergarten,
my
mother
used
the
typewriter
quite
frequently.
I
cannot
say
for
certain
whether
my
own
desire
to
use
the
typewriter
came
from
curiosity
about
technology,
an
innate
love
for
writing,
or
simply
a
young
boy's
desire
to
imitate
his
parents,
but,
whatever
my
motivations,
I
was
writing
with
my
family's
typewriter
at
a
young
age.
Because
my
mother
usually
did
not
put
paper
in
the
typewriter
when
I
used
it,
however,
I
have
no
way
of
knowing
now
what
I
possibly
could
have
been
typing.
From
kindergarten
through
second
grade,
writing
assignments
frustrated
me
to
some
degree
because
I
suffered
from
fine
motor
delay,
which,
in
simplified
terms,
meant
that
my
handwriting
was
illegible.
I
still
managed
to
achieve
good
grades,
however,
due
in
part
to
a
specially
designed
desk
attachment.
My
handwriting
was
not
the
only
source
of
frustration,
however.
For
instance,
I
remember
a
creative
writing
assignment
where
I
chose
to
write
a
fictitious
biography
of
a
superhero
named
meWindmaker
and
Windstopper.mo
My
teacher
did
not
understand
that
meWindmaker
and
Windstoppermo
was
one
person,
so,
every
time
I
used
a
singular
verb
with
the
character's
name,
she
marked
the
verb
as
incorrect.
This
experience
left
an
impression
on
me
that
my
creativity
needed
limits;
anything
too
out
of
the
ordinary,
such
as
a
singular
entity
with
a
coordinating
conjunction
in
its
name,
would
be
problematic
for
my
readers.
At
least
this
would
be
the
case
during
elementary
school
while
teachers
doubted
my
facility
with
grammar.
At
some
point
during
my
third-grade
year,
my
parents
successfully
convinced
the
administration
of
my
elementary
school
to
provide
me
with
a
computer
in
order
that
I
might
type
some
of
my
longer
writing
assignments.
One
might
have
imagined
that
the
Apple
II
had
outlived
its
usefulness
by
1996,
but
I
was
still
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
produce
legible
work.
I
quickly
discovered
an
additional
benefit
of
the
computer:
I
could
get
away
with
writing
stories
on
it
during
class.
In
retrospect,
I
am
astounded
that
my
third-
and
fourth-grade
teachers
permitted
this
flagrant
disregard
for
their
lectures.
In
fact,
they
even
allowed
me
to
read
my
stories
to
the
class!
My
stories
received
accolades
from
my
fellow
classmates
due
to
the
storiesyu
fairly
immature
humor
and
my
impassioned
delivery.
However,
after
I
wrote
a
story
about
cannibalism,
my
fourth-grade
teacher
prohibited
me
from
reading
any
more
stories
to
the
class
unless
he
carefully
screened
them.
That
summer,
I
entered
a
national
Roald
Dahl
essay
contest
for
elementary
school
students.
I
needed
to
write
about
why
I
enjoyed
my
three
favorite
Dahl
books,
which,
in
my
case,
were
Matilda,
The
Witches,
and
Charlie
and
the
Great
Glass
Elevator.
Because
I
had
not
written
a
full
essay
up
until
that
point,
I
had
much
trouble
determining
how
to
start.
My
mother
taught
me
the
five-paragraph
essay
format,
which
really
worked
well
for
the
contest
because
each
of
the
three
paragraphs
of
the
essay's
body
could
be
about
a
different
book.
Through
learning
about
this
essay
format,
I
also
became
acquainted
with
the
concept
of
the
thesis
statement.
The
thesis
would
make
my
essay
whole;
it
would
connect
my
thoughts
about
the
three
Dahl
books
in
a
way
that
would
make
sense
to
the
reader.
My
mother
expressed
surprise
at
the
fact
that
I
had
not
yet
learned
about
either
the
five-paragraph
essay
or
the
thesis
statement
in
school;
she
opined
that
I
would
find
the
format
to
be
essential
as
I
progressed
through
school,
even
through
college.
The
fact
that
I
later
became
one
of
the
contestyus
five
winners
chosen
from
across
the
nation
seemed
to
validate
my
mother's
claim.
I
was
sure
that
with
mastery
of
the
five-paragraph
essay
format
would
come
great
success.
It
was
my
secret
weapon!
In
fifth
grade,
I
transferred
to
a
more
technologically
inclined
school
in
which
all
students
were
expected
to
type
major
assignments,
so
there
was
no
longer
a
need
for
me
to
have
my
Apple
II.
My
English
teacher
was
a
published
author
of
fiction
for
adolescents,
so
my
classmates
and
I
were
apt
to
take
her
suggestions
for
writing
seriously.
Our
first
assignment
in
her
class
was
a
focused
free-write.
She
told
us
that
free-writing
was
a
great
way
to
get
into
a
mindset
conducive
to
good
writing
and
could
be
especially
helpful
for
overcoming
writer's
block.
At
that
point,
I
had
never
really
experienced
writer's
block,
so
I
considered
this
and
subsequent
free-writing
assignments
to
be
exercises
in
futility.
Especially
problematic
was
her
instruction
to
write
whatever
came
to
mind,
even
if
it
was
off-topic.
Unfortunately,
my
mind
was
always
running
incoherently
off-topic,
so
most
of
the
entries
in
my
free-writing
journal
contained
a
few
on-topic
sentences
followed
by
a
stream
of
nonsensical
exclamations
and
punctuation.
Surely,
I
thought,
there
must
be
a
better
way
to
become
focused.
My
new
school
had
designed
the
fifth-grade
curriculum
to
be
a
major
step
in
the
students'
development.
Fifth
grade
marked
the
beginning
of
middle
school,
which
meant
passing
classes
(rather
than
having
one
main
teacher),
increased
homework,
and
more
complex
assignments.
Our
English
teacher
informed
us
at
the
beginning
of
the
school
year
that
we
would,
by
the
end
of
the
year,
each
compose
a
research
paper
about
a
topic
related
to
Pennsylvania.
The
challenge
of
writing
a
research
paper
seemed
quite
daunting,
and
it
was,
in
some
ways,
a
specter
that
loomed
over
my
classmates
and
me
as
we
progressed
through
the
year.
Before
this
assignment,
however,
we
each
wrote
a
major
creative
writing
piece.
Due
to
my
experiences
in
the
third
and
fourth
grades,
I
dove
into
this
assignment
fearlessly,
producing
what
would
become
my
final
piece
of
creative
fiction,
meSuper
Hens.mo
My
peers
received
my
work
positively,
as
did
my
teacher.
I
could
not
have
expected
that
my
greatest
success
that
year,
in
any
subject,
would
come
from
that
seemingly
ominous
research
paper.
The
most
important
lessons
I
learned
from
my
English
class
that
year
were
how
to
use
outside
sources
for
a
research
paper
and
how
to
write
a
bibliography.
Unfortunately,
instruction
about
how
to
properly
cite
sources
in
the
body
of
a
paper
did
not
accompany
these
lessons,
but
our
English
teacher
was
not
concerned,
I
suppose,
with
the
fifth
grade's
rampant
plagiarism,
however
unintentional
and
naFu
e.
Still,
learning
how
to
synthesize
outside
sources
into
an
original
work
opened
many
doors
for
intellectual
growth.
Philadelphia,
the
city
of
my
birth,
was
the
subject
of
my
paper,
but,
before
my
paper,
I
knew
little
about
the
city.
This
research
paper
clarified
for
me
that
writing
was
itself
a
form
of
learning.
As
I
wrote
my
paper,
more
questions
about
Philadelphia
came
to
mind,
as
if
I
were
engaged
in
a
conversation
with
myself.
At
the
end
of
the
year,
every
student
presented
his
or
her
paper
to
the
entire
fifth-grade
class
and
to
all
of
our
teachers.
The
copious
applause
and
praise
I
received
from
both
my
peers
and
my
teachers
encouraged
me
to
continue
academic
writing;
I
decided
that
perhaps
the
more
scholarly
form
of
writing,
as
opposed
to
creative
writing,
was
my
true
forte.
During
the
summer
before
eighth
grade,
I
enrolled
in
my
first
college
course:
an
American
history
course
at
Wilkes
University.
During
this
class
I
became
proficient
at
one
of
the
more
mundane
forms
of
writing:
lecture
transcription.
I
had
taken
notes
in
class
before,
but,
in
my
classes
in
middle
school,
I
could
still
succeed
by
studying
principally
from
the
textbooks.
To
pass
this
college
course,
however,
I
needed
to
take
excellent
notes.
I
managed
to
do
very
well
on
my
exams
by
transcribing
virtually
everything
my
professor
said
onto
my
AlphaSmart
3000,
a
sort
of
oversized
palmtop
computer.
Going
into
this
course,
I
feared
the
infamous
mefinal
paper.mo
My
parents
warned
me
that
I
would
need
to
start
working
on
this
paper
well
in
advance.
Luckily,
my
professor
assigned
a
book
review,
a
rather
light
final
paper
assignment.
meThis,mo
he
stated
emphatically,
meis
a
book
review,
not
a
book
report.mo
The
students
needed
to
take
a
stance
on
their
chosen
books
just
as
critics
for,
say,
The
New
York
Times
share
their
opinions
of
books.
This
paper
was,
I
believe,
my
first
persuasive
essay.
I
learned
the
strategy
of
acknowledging
the
opposing
viewpoint
while
strengthening
my
own,
a
skill
that
would
prove
invaluable
when
I
would
later
write
argument
papers
as
an
undergrad.
As
I
entered
high
school,
I
developed
great
confidence
in
my
writing.
By
the
time
I
finished
my
sophomore
year
of
high
school,
I
had
completed
more
than
one
year's
worth
of
college
credits
with,
by
any
measure,
rather
high
marks.
These
college
classes
required
that
I
challenge
myself
to
write
in
a
variety
of
formats,
such
as
research
papers,
argument
papers,
theater
reviews,
and
theoretical
analyses.
Writing
also
began
to
open
many
doors
for
me
outside
the
classroom.
Near
the
end
of
eighth
grade,
I
became
a
Jack
Kent
Cooke
Foundation
Young
Scholar,
and
my
application
essays
were
crucial
in
obtaining
the
award.
Around
this
same
time,
I
took
third
place
in
a
local
Martin
Luther
King
Jr.
Day
essay
competition.
In
conjunction
with
strong
scores
on
the
PSAT,
an
essay
helped
me
secure
a
National
Merit
Scholarship.
Because
I
was
already
taking
so
many
college
courses,
and
because
I
had
won
a
National
Merit
Scholarship
when
I
was
only
a
sophomore
in
high
school,
I
decided
to
see
whether
or
not
I
could
start
attending
college
full-time
the
following
year.
I
discovered
the
early
college
program
at
Bard
College
at
Simon's
Rock
in
Great
Barrington,
Massachusetts.
My
parents
reluctantly
agreed
to
let
me
apply,
but
they
would
allow
me
to
matriculate
if
and
only
if
I
received
a
full
scholarship
to
the
college.
Since
Simon's
Rock
prides
itself
on
its
strong
emphasis
on
writing,
the
application
for
the
Acceleration
to
Excellence
full
scholarship
contained
diverse,
challenging
writing
assignments.
I
had
to
write
three
papers:
a
letter
to
an
elected
official
about
an
important
issue
of
my
choice,
an
analysis
of
a
passage
by
Plato,
and
a
persuasive
argument
agreeing
or
disagreeing
with
a
quotation
selected
from
a
provided
list
of
about
ten.
My
efforts
paid
off.
I
won
a
full
scholarship
to
Simon's
Rock
and
matriculated
there
at
age
sixteen.
By
this
point,
my
writing
had
taken
me
so
far
that
I
was,
perhaps,
too
self-confident.
As
I
entered
Simon's
Rock,
I
imagined
that
I
was
the
perfect
writer
and
that
my
writing
needed
no
improvement.
After
all,
I
thought,
my
success
in
so
many
college
courses
at
a
young
age
was
irrefutable
proof
that
I
had
completely
mastered
the
craft
of
writing!
I
was
fully
confident
that
I
was
more
than
meadequately
preparedmo
for
college
writing.
Fortunately,
my
professors
not
only
knew
better
but
were
determined
to
ensure
that
I
knew
better
as
well.
For
my
first
essay
in
First-Year
Seminar,
I
wrote
about
how
the
Tiresias
character
in
Oedipus
Rex
by
Sophocles
was
related
to
the
Tiresias
character
in
Bacchae
by
Euripides.
I
thought
highly
of
my
analysis,
but
my
professor
certainly
did
not.
I
earned
a
C-
on
the
paper.
I
was
mortified
because,
until
then,
I
had
only
ever
received
such
low
grades
in
math
classes,
never
on
any
writing
assignments.
I
asked
my
professor
why
I
had
received
such
a
low
grade.
Although
I
had
adequately
shown
that
the
two
Tiresias
were
connected,
I
failed
to
explain
why
this
fact
was
important
and
what
broader
implications
the
connection
had
for
both
works
of
literature;
my
paper
addressed
the
what
of
the
issue
rather
than
the
why.
I
was
upset,
but
I
accepted
my
professor's
criticism.
In
retrospect,
this
was
a
truly
pivotal
moment
in
my
academic
career.
Thereafter,
my
academic
papers
would
always
include
an
analysis
of
the
deeper
implications
of
the
topic
at
hand.
Later
in
my
academic
career,
several
of
my
professors
would
read
or
distribute
my
thesis
paragraphs,
or
sometimes
even
my
entire
essays,
to
my
classmates
as
examples
of
strong
paths
of
inquiry
to
pursue
in
essays.
That
C-
taught
me
an
important
lesson:
my
writing
would
need
to
have
a
purpose
and
would
need
to
examine
tough
issues.
Prepared
to
face
new
challenges,
I
transferred
to
Lafayette
College
in
2007.
During
the
spring
semester
of
2008,
I
decided
to
submit
a
paper
of
mine
that
had
been
particularly
successful,
in
the
opinion
of
my
professor,
to
a
national
contest.
I
needed
a
faculty
sponsor
for
the
contest,
and
the
professor
for
whose
class
I
had
originally
composed
the
essay
agreed
to
sponsor
me.
With
a
copy
of
my
essay
in
hand,
I
met
with
him
in
his
office.
I
was
completely
unprepared
for
him
to
start
tearing
my
essay
apart
(figuratively)
with
his
pen!
He
had
originally
praised
my
essay,
read
part
of
it
aloud
to
the
class
as
an
example
of
strong
writing,
and
given
me
an
meAmo
without
marking
up
any
part
of
the
paper!
meYes,mo
he
said,
mewhat
you
have
here
is
fine
for
class,
but
it
is
not
going
to
cut
it
for
a
national
contest.mo
Although
he
had
no
qualms
with
my
thesis
or
even
with
my
supporting
evidence,
he
did
not
like
my
prose.
I
carefully
looked
over
his
suggestions
and
made
changes.
Then
I
looked
over
my
paper
again
and
made
more
changes.
Then
I
repeated
the
process
about
ten
more
times.
How
could
I
have
never
before
noticed
how
many
ambiguities,
awkward
phrases,
imprecise
word
choices,
and
unclear
pronouns
existed
in
my
writing?
My
success
in
writing
thus
far
must
have
relied
solely
on
argument,
not
on
presentation.
My
prose
was
ugly.
I
had
never
before
considered
how
the
presentation
of
my
ideas
might
diminish
their
impact.
From
that
point
on,
however,
I
vowed
to
focus
not
only
on
the
flow
of
my
argument
but
also
on
the
flow
of
my
language.
This
summer
has
proven
to
be
another
landmark
in
my
development
as
a
writer,
for
I
have
done
much
more
personal
writing
than
I
ever
have
before.
Personal
statements
for
law
school
applications,
scholarship
applications
seeking
my
reflection
upon
my
academic
ambitions,
and
this
very
essay
have
all
conspired
to
turn
this
summer
into
the
summer
during
which
I
wrote
my
autobiography.
Because
I
am
not
fond
of
self-reflection,
I
find
this
type
of
writing
even
more
difficult
than
typical
academic
papers.
It
is
curious
that
a
format
of
writing
that
should,
on
the
surface,
seem
so
natural
could
be
the
one
format
that
discomforts
me
the
most.
Nevertheless,
the
experience,
I
would
argue,
has
been
highly
beneficial.
I
am
a
firm
believer
that
the
process
of
writing
is
intrinsically
educational;
when
I
write
essays
for
class,
I
learn
things
that
I
could
not
have
learned
without
engaging
in
the
writing
process.
This
learning
element
is
just
as
present,
if
not
more
so,
in
personal
writing.
By
writing
about
why
I
changed
my
major
from
music
to
English,
for
instance,
I
discovered
important
reasons
for
my
decision
of
which
I
was
initially
not
conscious,
a
self-discovery
that
reconfirmed
the
benefits
of
my
altered
path
and
also
illuminated
what
my
future
may
hold.
This
summeryus
personal
essays
have
helped
me
grow
not
only
as
a
writer
but
as
an
individual.
The
future
promises
many
new,
exciting
writing
challenges.
I
expect
that
my
honors
thesis,
by
far
the
longest
single
text
I
will
have
written
to
date,
will
also
challenge
me
in
new
ways.
In
law
school,
I
will
have
to
learn
melegal
writing,mo
which
I
have
heard
is
quite
unlike
any
other
sort
of
writing.
Beyond
that
may
lie
opportunities
for
writing
that
I
cannot
fully
fathom.
I
will
no
doubt
embrace
and
meet
these
challenges.
As
a
lover
of
writing,
I
owe
it
to
the
art
to
always
continue
improving.
The
joys
of
writing
come
not
only
from
the
finished
product
but
also
from
the
process.
Therefore,
it
is
only
logical
that
my
growth
as
a
writer
should
itself
be
a
lifelong
process.
I
can
hardly
wait
to
continue
writing
my
life's
story!
