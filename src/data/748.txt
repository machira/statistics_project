Literacy
Narrative
Reading
has
had
a
large
impact
on
my
writing
career.
I
cannot
remember
when
I
began
enjoying
writing,
but
I
began
reading
for
pleasure
at
a
very
young
age.
I
believe
that
reading
leads
to
good
writing
because
being
exposed
to
quality
writing
not
only
helps
a
reader
learn
new
words,
but
also
recognize
the
proper
rules
of
grammar.
I
believe
that
the
person
who
has
influenced
my
writing
the
most
is
my
mother.
She
always
encouraged
my
reading
habit
and
provided
me
with
an
endless
supply
of
books
that
she
read
to
me
as
a
child
and
later,
books
that
I
could
read
independently.
The
first
writing
experience
that
I
can
remember
took
place
in
Kindergarten;
we
were
told
to
write
our
own
illustrated
story.
Although
I
cannot
remember
if
the
assignment
was
meant
to
be
a
non-fiction
piece
or
if
that
was
simply
a
personal
choice,
I
wrote
my
story
about
how
my
infant
sister
was
diagnosed
with
cancer
and
how
that
experience
made
me
feel.
After
we
had
written,
illustrated
and
assembled
the
books
(complete
with
colored
tape
for
the
binding),
the
students
from
my
call
had
a
book
fair
in
the
gymnasium
that
all
our
parents
were
invited
to.
Students
were
able
to
show
off
their
books
to
their
parents
and
I
remember
the
feeling
of
pride
I
experienced
from
showing
my
parents
my
completed
project.
I
also
greatly
enjoyed
writing
a
story
that
really
happened
which
I
think
sparked
my
future
love
for
non-fiction
writing.
The
rest
of
my
writing
experiences
throughout
elementary
seem
to
blend
together.
English
was
always
my
favorite
subject
and
I
still
loved
to
read
and
write,
but
no
assignment
seemed
as
special
as
the
first
one
I
did
in
Kindergarten.
In
Fourth
Grade,
our
teacher
allowed
us
to
write
stories
during
free
time
and
mine
were
usually
about
funny
families
much
like
my
own,
but
none
of
the
stories
I
had
written
really
seem
to
stand
out
in
my
mind.
One
thing
I
liked
about
writing
these
stories
was
designing
the
cover
and
adding
illustrations
so
younger
kids
could
enjoy
them
too,
but
like
a
typical
4th
grader,
I
had
pretty
sloppy
handwriting
and
I
would
focus
so
much
on
making
sure
that
my
stories
were
legible
and
NprettyO
that
I
often
did
not
have
time
to
finish
them.
As
I
got
older
and
was
able
to
do
my
assignments
on
a
computer,
I
was
able
to
focus
on
the
story
again
and
I
did
not
have
to
worry
about
whether
or
not
my
audience
could
read
my
handwriting.
In
Seventh
Grade,
we
began
to
focus
more
on
grammar
in
Language
Arts
class.
I
was
the
only
student
in
my
class
who
loved
grammar
lessons
and
got
excited
when
we
had
homework
in
our
grammar
book.
When
I
was
in
Seventh
Grade,
I
attempted
to
start
a
journal,
just
like
my
favorite
character
in
my
favorite
book,
but
I
was
still
very
self-conscious
about
my
handwriting
and
I
usually
ripped
pages
out
of
my
journal
because
I
was
afraid
that
someone
would
see
it.
In
Eighth
Grade,
I
was
faced
with
a
new
writing
challenge:
poetry.
During
the
school
year,
I
had
contracted
a
bad
case
of
pneumonia
and
had
to
miss
several
days
of
school
and
naturally,
the
lessons
that
I
missed
were
some
of
the
hardest
ones
including
poetry
and
meter.
When
I
returned
to
school,
my
teacher
asked
me
to
make
up
the
poetry
assignments
that
I
had
missed,
including
writing
my
own
poem
with
a
particular
meter.
I
thought
that
this
assignment
was
particularly
challenging
for
an
8th
grader,
but
with
my
momOs
help,
I
was
able
to
learn
about
meter
and
eventually
create
my
own
poem.
Looking
back,
I
am
glad
that
I
spent
the
extra
time
focusing
on
meter
because
it
has
been
stressed
(no
pun
intended)
so
often
in
my
English
classes
throughout
high
school
and
college.
Another
lesson
that
I
gained
during
this
assignment
was
that
although
I
was
a
terrible
poet,
I
was
actually
very
good
at
rhyming.
Freshman
year
of
high
school,
I
was
taking
Honors
English
and
I
had
my
favorite
teacher
of
all
time,
Mrs.
Oram.
who
I
would
later
have
again
for
AP
English
my
senior
year.
Mrs.
OramOs
love
for
books
and
grammar
strengthened
my
love
for
them
and
made
me
even
more
excited
about
English.
Because
of
Mrs.
OramOs
class,
I
began
to
think
about
becoming
an
English
teacher
when
I
grew
up
so
that
I
could
teach
others
how
to
write
too.
During
my
sophomore
year
of
high
school,
we
were
asked
to
bring
in
a
special
item
from
home
that
we
then
traded
with
a
partner.
When
we
were
given
our
partnerOs
item,
we
then
had
to
writing
a
story
that
included
it.
While
my
partner
wrote
a
very
serious
story,
I
wrote
a
humorous
piece
about
a
superhero
that
wore
high
multi-colored
striped
socks
(my
partnerOs
NspecialO
item).
After
reading
both
stories,
I
enjoyed
her
serious
and
dramatic
tone
just
as
much
as
the
light,
funny
tone
in
my
story.
I
think
reading
and
comparing
these
two
stories
helped
me
develop
the
sarcastic
tone
that
I
often
use
in
writing
today
instead
of
just
hoping
that
my
story
with
make
readers
laugh.
I
also
liked
this
assignment
because
I
liked
having
the
item
as
inspiration
instead
of
having
to
come
up
with
a
story
idea
entirely
on
our
own.
During
my
junior
year
of
high
school,
I
took
a
class
called
NPublicationsO.
Apparently
the
course
was
originally
taught
about
the
yearbook,
but
luckily
the
curriculum
had
changed
by
the
time
that
I
took
the
course.
Each
day,
there
would
be
a
question
or
topic
written
on
the
blackboard
that
we
had
to
respond
to
in
our
journals.
I
loved
having
these
writing
prompts
so
much
so
that
much
to
the
chagrin
of
my
classmates,
I
would
share
my
responses
almost
every
day
during
the
discussion.
My
favorite
part
of
this
class
was
the
final
project
in
which
we
were
asked
to
put
together
our
own
magazine.
My
magazine
was
a
holiday
edition
complete
with
a
shopping
guide
and
product
reviews.
I
loved
combining
my
love
for
clothes
and
shopping
with
my
love
for
writing
and
again,
my
writing
was
mostly
non-fiction.
Throughout
high
school
we
were
required
to
do
writing
prompts
in
each
class
during
every
marking
period
(including
gym!)
Because
I
did
these
5-paragraph
essays
so
often,
I
would
write
them
according
to
a
simple
formula.
The
first
paragraph
would
be
my
introduction
and
including
my
three
main
ideas
that
would
each
be
explained
in
their
own
body
paragraph
and
summed
up
in
the
conclusion.
These
writing
prompts
were
so
monotonous
that
I
do
not
believe
that
they
helped
my
writing
at
all
with
the
exception
of
forcing
me
to
use
more
transitions.
During
high
school,
when
I
had
a
take-home
essay,
I
would
always
ask
my
mom
to
proof
read
it,
but
instead
of
making
changes,
she
would
always
explain
each
mistake
so
that
I
understood
why
it
was
wrong
and
how
I
could
fix
it.
Although
I
hated
this
at
the
time,
it
definitely
helped
me
become
a
better
writer
by
understanding
common
writing
mistakes
and
how
they
can
be
avoided.
I
knew
that
I
was
a
decent
writer
in
high
school,
but
I
did
not
really
try
to
improve
my
writing
skills
until
I
got
to
college.
During
my
First
Year
Orientation
course,
the
three
papers
I
was
required
to
write
did
not
seem
particularly
difficult
to
me
and
I
genuinely
enjoyed
writing
them.
Because
of
this
course
and
an
English
course
I
took
during
my
first
semester
at
Lafayette,
I
realized
that
my
choice
to
become
an
English
major
was
a
good
one.
I
liked
the
feeling
of
filling
an
empty
word
document
with
ideas
that
were
entirely
my
own.
Throughout
college,
my
friends
have
asked
me
many
times
to
proofread
their
papers.
I
have
helped
my
friends
to
not
only
learn
their
mistakes,
but
I
have
also
used
these
opportunities
to
view
other
styles
of
writing
that
can
help
improve
my
own
writing.
Following
my
sophomore
year
at
Lafayette,
I
did
an
internship
at
W
Magazine.
My
internship
was
in
the
art
department
of
the
magazine
and
although
I
did
enjoy
it,
I
desperately
had
wished
that
I
applied
for
a
writing
internship
at
the
magazine
instead.
It
was
another
clear
sign
that
writing
was
what
I
loved
to
do.
During
my
junior
year
at
Lafayette,
I
took
a
creative
writing
course,
which
is
probably
my
favorite
course
that
I
have
taken
in
the
last
three
years.
I
have
a
very
active
imagination
so
I
loved
coming
up
with
my
own
short
stories,
but
sometimes
I
had
too
many
ideas
of
what
the
story
should
be
about.
I
wrote
mostly
serious
stories,
but
I
still
attempted
to
write
satirically
as
well.
This
class
also
forced
me
to
face
poetry
again
and
because
we
were
given
specific
types
of
poems
to
write,
I
did
not
hate
writing
poetry
this
time.
Taking
creative
writing
taught
me
that
as
long
as
I
was
writing
about
a
topic
that
I
found
interesting
or
enjoyable,
it
did
not
matter
the
form
that
I
wrote
it
in.
Although
my
writing
is
not
perfect,
I
try
very
hard
to
make
my
writing
enjoyable
for
the
reader.
