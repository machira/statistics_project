Lenin
lived,
Lenin
lives,
Lenin
will
live
forever
-
these
were
the
first
words
that
I
learned
how
to
read
and
write.
I
remember
it
as
if
it
were
yesterday.
It
was
my
first
day
of
school.
When
I
walked
in,
I
saw
about
thirty
other
children,
all
dressed
in
the
uniform,
sitting
in
the
classroom
and
listening
to
the
teacher.
She
told
us
to
open
the
textbooks,
and
on
the
fist
page
I
saw
a
huge
portrait
of
Lenin.
Although
I
already
knew
very
well
who
he
was
from
earlier
lessons
in
the
kindergarten,
the
teacher
once
again
started
a
long
lecture
about
his
fame
and
deeds.
After
that
we
started
trying
to
read
the
large
red
letters
that
were
beneath
the
portrait
and
which
I
cited
above.
It
was
not
clear
to
me
as
a
six-year-old
child
how
it
could
be
that
Lenin
would
still
live
if
he
was
already
dead,
but
the
teacher
explained
to
us
that
he
would
live
forever
in
our
hearts.
Apart
from
reading
stories
about
Lenin,
there
was
not
much
propaganda
in
the
elementary
school.
Like
children
everywhere
in
the
world,
most
of
the
time
we
were
asked
to
write
stories
about
all
kinds
of
fairy
tale
characters
like
animals
and
birds.
Then
we
would
exchange
our
stories
with
other
children
and
read
them
out
loud.
At
that
stage
the
teacher
didn't
pay
a
lot
of
attention
to
our
spelling
or
grammar,
but
she
always
made
sure
that
in
our
self-made
fairy
tales
positive
characters
defeated
the
negative
ones.
As
I
grew
older,
I
started
noticing
more
and
more
ideological
readings
and
writings
being
assigned.
I
was
in
the
fourth
grade
when
I
joined
the
Young
Pioneer
Organization,
which
is
very
similar
to
boy/girl
scout
associations
in
the
US,
only
in
the
USSR
there
was
always
some
kind
of
ideological
aspect
to
it.
We
listened
to
a
lot
of
songs
praising
the
Communist
Party
and
our
country,
and
saying
that
the
rest
of
the
world
was
capitalist
and
evil.
Several
of
my
friends
and
I
once
even
had
an
assignment
to
write
a
song
like
this
for
class
and
sing
it,
but
out
efforts
were
not
very
successful.
The
teacher
was
unhappy
with
us
because
we
could
not
find
a
good
rhyme
for
the
words
Lenin
and
communist
.
After
our
unsuccessful
presentation
in
class
we
had
to
go
to
the
school
principal's
office
and
listen
to
half
an
hour
of
don't
ever
do
it
again
,
and
our
parents
were
notified
of
our
behavior
that
was
incompatible
with
the
title
of
a
Young
Pioneer
.
The
teacher
though
never
again
asked
our
class
to
write
ideological
songs.
All
students
had
to
take
literature
classes
every
year,
and
we
usually
read
Russian
and
foreign
classics
and
poetry,
but
at
later
stages
more
attention
was
given
to
the
Soviet
writers
of
the
twentieth
century.
We
were
assigned
to
read
books
like
The
Life
Of
Chapayev,
who
was
a
famous
Soviet
military
general
after
the
World
War
1.
After
reading
this
book
we
were
assigned
to
write
our
thoughts
about
it,
but
once
again
to
get
a
good
grade
a
student
had
to
praise
the
book,
and
pretend
that
he
or
she
agrees
with
the
author.
It
was
impossible
to
criticize
the
main
character,
because
he
was
the
symbol
of
the
state
ideology.
It
was
only
possible
to
read
the
essays
written
by
the
state
critics
and
then
paraphrase
them.
Writing
down
one's
own
opinions,
especially
if
they
did
not
match
the
teacher's
or
the
state
critics',
was
not
encouraged.
At
that
time
I
was
also
the
editor
of
the
school
newspaper.
Of
course
there
was
not
even
a
sign
of
any
kind
of
freedom
of
expression
in
my
school,
just
like
everywhere
else
in
the
Soviet
Union.
We
were
only
allowed
to
write
articles
about
what
the
Pioneer
Organization
was
doing
in
school,
about
its
activities
and
outings.
Even
such
articles
had
to
be
read
by
several
adults
before
there
were
allowed
to
be
printed.
I
even
remember
several
teachers
showing
me
a
book
with
a
set
of
rules
stating
subjects
about
which
I
could
and
couldn't
write.
A
year
later,
however,
I
came
back
to
school
after
being
on
a
sick
leave
for
about
two
weeks,
and
noticed
that
in
the
new
issue
of
the
school
newspaper,
which
came
out
without
my
help.
A
large
article
on
the
first
page
caught
my
attention
right
away.
It
was
written
by
one
of
my
friends
about
one
of
our
teachers
who
was
preaching
too
much
in
class
about
what
a
real
pioneer
should
be.
I
could
not
believe
my
eyes
-
I
thought
my
friend
would
be
expelled
from
school
right
away
or
at
least
put
on
a
severe
probation.
Days,
then
weeks
passed,
and
nothing
happened.
Then
I
saw
more
and
more
articles
like
that
appearing
not
only
in
the
school
newspaper,
but
in
the
real,
adult
newspapers
published
countrywide.
They
were
about
the
new
political
and
economic
reforms,
the
words
that
I
could
hardly
understand
then.
Although
I
didn't
know
what
was
happening,
I
could
feel
that
some
important
change
was
under
way,
something
that
would
change
not
only
the
way
people
wrote
their
articles,
but
the
whole
way
of
life
in
the
country.
The
Soviet
Union
and
censorship
was
living
its
last
days.
In
December
1991,
I
suddenly
woke
up
in
a
new,
free
country.
Now
there
was
a
complete
freedom
as
of
what
one
could
write,
either
in
the
newspaper
or
in
a
school
essay.
Suddenly
the
teachers
started
encouraging
us
to
write
down
our
own
thoughts
and
ideas,
and
at
first
all
students
had
a
very
hard
time.
It
was
not
that
we
were
not
taught
to
think
on
our
own,
it
was
that
there
was
a
fear
that
the
old
system
was
not
dead
yet
or
that
it
could
come
back,
punishing
us
for
our
opinions.
But
slowly
we
were
opening
up.
The
process
was
helped
by
reading
new,
revised
textbooks
which
told
us
the
history
of
our
country
in
a
completely
new
light,
without
any
ideology.
I
first
started
to
learn
English
when
I
was
in
the
fifth
grade,
still
under
the
Soviet
system.
For
me
then
foreign
language
was
just
one
of
the
requirements
that
I
needed
to
fulfill,
and
I
was
not
particularly
interested
in
that
class.
I
realized
that
because
the
country
was
closed
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world,
I
would
never
be
able
to
travel
abroad,
so
the
use
of
English
or
any
other
foreign
language
for
me
was
very
limited.
When
the
Soviet
Union
collapsed,
though,
the
border
was
opened
and
people
were
allowed
to
travel
themselves
and
invite
foreign
guests.
International
students
started
coming
to
my
school,
many
of
them
from
England
and
the
US.
This
is
when
I
had
my
first
chance
to
practice
spoken
English
and
make
friends
with
people
from
other
countries,
and
my
first
writing
experience
in
English
was
when
I
tried
to
keep
in
touch
with
these
friends
after
they
went
home.
It
was
very
difficult
at
first,
because
my
vocabulary
was
very
limited
and
I
needed
to
look
up
almost
every
word.
As
this
correspondence
went
along,
I
realized
that
I
would
need
English
for
both
personal
and
career
purposes,
and
took
a
more
advanced
course.
During
this
course
I
learned
more
advanced
vocabulary
and
grammar,
but
there
was
not
much
writing
involved,
only
reading
and
speaking.
However,
it
was
then
that
I
learned
that
there
was
an
opportunity
for
me
to
study
abroad.
I
applied
for
an
exchange
program
with
Carolina
Friends
School,
in
North
Carolina,
and
I
was
accepted.
In
the
following
three
months
I
spoke
only
English
to
my
host
family,
teachers
and
classmates,
and
took
the
same
classes
that
American
students
were
taken.
The
hardest
one
for
me
was
North
Carolina
Literature
class.
I
not
only
had
to
read
over
thirty
pages
a
day
while
still
using
a
dictionary,
but
also
write
five-paragraph
and
critical
essays
to
express
my
opinion
on
what
I
was
reading.
This
was
something
that
I
have
never
been
taught
to
do,
and
as
a
result
some
of
my
essays
needed
to
go
through
four
or
five
drafts
before
the
teacher
would
accept
them.
Besides
the
Literature
class,
I
also
had
seven
other
classes,
each
of
which
involved
more
or
less
writing.
In
my
Middle
Ages
History
class
I
had
to
imagine
that
I
was
a
medieval
lord
who
owned
a
castle,
land,
serfs
and
horses,
and
to
write
an
8-page
paper
about
my
life
as
this
lord
-
my
first
ever
creative
writing
assignment.
To
do
this
I
had
to
read
many
history
books
to
research
the
matter,
and
then
try
to
put
this
vast
body
of
knowledge
on
paper
in
my
own
words
mixed
with
my
thoughts
and
ideas.
I
remember
being
very
interested
in
the
subject
and
probably
doing
even
more
research
than
I
was
required
to.
It
was
probably
because
of
my
enthusiasm
that
I
succeeded
-
even
the
teacher
then
said
that
my
project
was
one
of
the
best
even
though
I
was
the
only
international
student
in
the
class.
My
next
significant
writing
experience
was
organizing
my
college
admission
essays
for
American
universities
and
colleges.
Because
my
chances
for
financial
aid
as
a
foreigner
were
extremely
limited,
I
had
to
apply
to
twelve
colleges.
Each
of
them
required
from
one
to
three
essays,
and
most
of
the
time
the
subjects
were
different
from
school
to
school.
For
example,
I
had
to
write
a
Statement
of
Purpose
telling
the
admissions
officer
why
I
wanted
to
go
to
college,
why
I
chose
a
college
in
the
US,
and
why
I
made
a
decision
to
go
to
that
particular
school,
as
well
as
what
kind
of
career
I
saw
myself
pursuing
in
the
future.
Even
now,
three
years
later,
I
can
not
quite
answer
some
of
these
why
and
what
questions,
and
it
was
much
more
difficult
for
me
then,
still
a
16-year
old
high
school
student.
I
also
had
to
write
essays
about
diversity
with
a
very
slight
idea
of
what
that
word
means,
because
where
I
lived
about
99%
of
all
population
was
Russian
and
white.
Another
essay
that
I
had
some
difficulty
with
was
about
the
honor
code
of
one
of
the
colleges.
Under
the
communist
system
everybody
took
some
kind
of
honor
code
for
granted,
and
I
never
thought
it
could
be
something
to
be
doubted
or
criticized
in
an
essay.
Because
I
studied
in
the
US
as
an
exchange
student
during
high
school,
college
writing
courses
were
not
a
great
shock
for
me.
I
had
to
do
even
more
reading
than
ever,
but
my
reading
skills
have
also
much
improved.
For
my
First
Year
Seminar,
I
had
to
write
an
8-page
interview
with
the
ghosts
of
Lenin,
Stalin,
Trotsky,
Robespierre
and
Danton
and
ask
them
about
their
thoughts
on
revolutions
and
other
political
events
that
they
took
part
in.
I
only
needed
to
do
research
on
the
last
two,
because
I
already
knew
a
lot
about
the
first
three
from
my
Russian
history
class
and
other
classes
in
high
and
middle
school.
I
also
knew
many
jokes
and
anecdotes
about
these
people
that
were
a
part
of
Russian
political
folklore,
and
I
included
them
in
the
paper.
This
paper
was
a
success,
which
made
me
notice
how
much
my
writing
had
improved
over
the
years.
I
did
not
have
a
lot
of
difficulty
completing
writing
assignments
for
the
courses
that
followed.
As
I
spoke
and
read
English
in
and
outside
of
classroom,
my
skills
in
this
language
were
constantly
improving.
I
also
sometimes
worked
with
the
writing
associate
assigned
for
a
course
or
with
an
ESL
one,
both
of
which
were
a
great
help
to
me
when
I
was
trying
to
get
rid
of
my
errors
in
prepositions
and
articles.
Several
weeks
ago
I
looked
over
my
high
school
writing
and
could
not
help
correcting
errors
in
sentences
that
seemed
so
perfect
a
few
years
ago.
That
made
me
realize
one
of
the
most
important
concepts
of
a
writer:
no
matter
how
good
and
sophisticated
writing
piece
might
seem,
there
is
something
that
may
need
to
be
changed
based
on
your
experience
with
the
matter
afterwards,
circumstances,
your
mood
even.
There
could
never
be
a
piece
of
perfect
writing.
