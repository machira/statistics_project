Literacy
Narrative

1999
When
first
reading
this
assignment,
I
was
a
little
worried.
Did
I
have
a
literary
history?
I
don't
remember
my
first
attempt
at
writing
or
any
personal
struggles
I
have
faced
while
trying
to
write.
Basically,
a
teacher
told
me
to
write
on
a
particular
topic
and
I
did
it.
This
assignment
is
mandatory,
though,
so
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
reflected
upon
the
papers
and
speeches
I
have
written
and
tried
to
compare
their
styles
and
composition.
After
a
few
minutes,
however,
I
realized
that
details
like
that
had
evaporated
long
ago,
but
I
had
retained
some
memories
of
my
attitude
toward
writing.
At
about
ten
or
eleven,
I
became
interested
in
poetry
and
spent
my
spare
time
composing
poems
that
consisted
of
end-rhyming
doublets.
I
still
have
the
notebook
containing
those
simple
verses
and
can't
help
but
laugh
as
I
read
my
poetic
view
of
such
superficial
topics
as
friends
and
flowers
.
I
don't
remember
why
I
stopped
writing
those
poems,
I
probably
got
too
busy
with
sports
and
other
school
activities.
I
never
let
anyone
read
my
poems
and
would
deny
access
to
them
even
now.
As
I
think
about
it
now,
those
poems
are
the
only
pieces
I
have
ever
written
voluntarily
and
my
interest
in
writing
plummeted
not
long
after
I
put
my
poetry
notebook
aside.
I
can't
recall
writing
in
elementary
school,
although
I'm
sure
I
did.
The
English
teachers
in
seventh
and
eighth
grades
in
my
school
were
notorious
for
lots
of
homework
and
impossible
matching
tests.
They
were
phenomenal
teachers.
Any
ability
to
construct
complicated
yet
clear
and
concise
sentences
that
I
now
possess
is
thanks
to
them.
We
diagrammed
hundreds
of
sentences
and
spent
hours
identifying
mismatches
in
agreement.
Part
of
the
reason
I
applied
to
be
a
writing
associate
was
that
I
had
confidence
in
my
grammatical
knowledge.
There
is
one
particular
assignment
from
ninth
grade
that
I
remember,
probably
because
I
won
an
award
for
it.
The
local
VFW
had
a
contest
in
which
the
students
were
to
write
about
their
views
on
being
an
American.
My
English
teacher
made
the
contest
mandatory
and
we
entered
our
paper
with
only
our
phone
number
for
identification
so
as
to
avoid
favoritism.
The
winner
from
our
class
went
on
to
compete
against
other
schools.
I
recall
having
some
difficulties
approaching
the
topic
because
it
wasn't
something
I
normally
consider.
Finally
I
deciciecj
to
use
an
extended
metaphor
in
which
I
managed
to
compare
aspects
of
American
life
to
the
members
of
a
basketball
team.
I
never
dreamt
that
I
would
be
chosen
the
winner
from
our
class.
Other
students
had
dedicated
lots
of
time
and
effort
to
writing
the
paper
and
I
felt
sort
of
guilty
being
such
an
apathetic
winner.
I
worked
hard,
but
was
basically
just
focused
on
finishing.
I
think
this
is
about
the
time
I
lost
my
enthusiasm
for
writing.
Although
I
was
somewhat
good,
I
found
it
such
a
chore.
In
tenth
grade,
I
took
a
speech
and
composition
class
that
instilled
confidence
in
my
ability
to
not
only
construct
a
coherent
paper,
but
also
present
it
with
class
and
dignity.
This
teacher
taught
a
very
strict
and
organized
way
of
outlining
a
composition
where
there
were
one
introductory,
one
summary,
and
five
topic
paragraphs.
Each
of
the
five
topic
paragraphs
had
seven
sentences:
one
introductory,
one
summary,
and
five
topic
sentences.
We
began
by
simply
outlining
paragraphs
on
any
topic,
then
some
of
those
outlines
were
turned
into
paragraphs,
and
eventually
we
put
together
entire
compositions.
The
rigid
rules
of
this
teacher's
writing
annoyed
me
because
I
had
always
sat
down
and
written
a
paper
with
little
preliminary
organizational
thought.
Although
I
adapted
to
his
demands
rather
easily,
my
attitude
toward
writing
was
becoming
poorer.
I
just
didn't
like
to
write.
When
we
entered
the
speech
section
of
the
class,
all
of
the
restrictions
were
lifted,
but
not
forgotten.
We
wrote
and
delivered
four
speeches:
an
informative,
demonstrative,
occasional,
and
persuasive.
To
say
that
this
teacher
was
critical
would
be
a
gross
understatement.
He
commented
on
everything
from
posture
to
tone,
along
with
the
written
quality
of
the
speech.
It
was
an
incredible
hassle
at
the
time,
but
I
learned
an
immense
amount
about
public
speaking.
I
may
not
have
enjoyed
writing
the
speech,
but
I
loved
delivering
it.
Because
of
this
experience,
I
am
comfortable
speaking
in
front
of
any
size
group
and
am
able
to
present
myself
with
poise
and
grace.
In
order
to
graduate
from
my
high
school,
one
must
complete
a
Senior
Project
consisting
of
a
ten
page
research
paper,
a
physical
project,
and
a
presentation.
The
student
can
choose
any
topic
which
is
conducive
to
the
requirements.
I
enjoyed
learning
about
my
topic,
but
agonized
over
the
writing.
Obviously,
a
lot
of
research
was
required
and
this
was
my
first
encounter
with
the
possibility
of
plagiarism.
Luckily,
my
Senior
English
teacher
provided
us
with
practice
exercises
to
familiarize
ourselves
with
the
issue.
At
the
time
it
seemed
fairly
insignificant,
but
being
able
to
absorb
and
restate
information
became
an
incredibly
important
skill
when
I
entered
college.
Every
high
school
senior
hears
the
horror
stories
of
the
first
college
paper,
but
I
really
wasn't
worried.
I
couldn't
imagine
what
preparation
one
could
receive
in
high
school
that
was
better
than
mine.
I
have
to
admit,
though,
I
was
nervous
entering
my
First
Year
Seminar.
Perhaps
it
was
just
the
nature
of
my
FYS,
but
I
found
it
rather
easy
to
write
the
papers
because
we
had
thoroughly
discussed
the
topics
in
class.
In
many
ways,
the
papers
were
restating
class
notes
and
making
connections
to
articles
we
had
read.
I
didn't
exactly
enjoy
the
writing,
but
it
was
so
straight
forward
that
I
was
able
to
complete
it
without
too
much
aggravation.
After
the
first
paper,
I
learned
what
kind
of
detail
was
expected
and
didn't
really
encounter
any
other
problems
during
that
course.
When
meeting
the
professor
of
my
First
Year
Writing
course,
I
was
a
little
nervous.
It
was
obvious
that
she
was
into
creative
writing,
and
I
have
not
been
blessed
with
creativity.
After
years
of
disliking
writing,
listening
to
this
woman
speak
about
it
really
inspired
me,
however.
Her
approach
to
teaching
was
much
different
than
I
had
ever
experienced
and
incredibly
refreshing.
We
had
the
option
of
keeping
a
journal
in
which
we
were
to
write
for
twenty
minutes
every
day
on
any
topic.
I
had
never
kept
any
kind
of
a
diary,
so
this
was
new
to
me.
She
explained
that
just
like
any
sport,
one
needs
to
practice
writing
in
order
to
be
good,
and
our
journal
served
that
purpose.
At
first
I
had
little
to
say,
but
I
gradually
became
used
to
expressing
my
thoughts
on
paper.
I
even
began
to
look
forward
to
writing
in
my
journal
because
it
gave
me
an
outlet
for
many
stresses.
More
interestingly,
this
woman
had
a
unique
style
of
writing
that
she
described
as
a
straight
line
.
Many
teachers
instruct
students
to
write
in
a
circle
so
that
the
conclusion
refers
back
to
the
introduction.
In
her
papers,
we
had
a
starting
point
and
were
working
towards
a
goal.
Referring
to
the
introduction
would
only
hinder
our
progress.
I
remember
speaking
to
many
of
the
other
students
in
the
class
and
they
had
difficulty
following
her
instructions.
As
in
the
past,
however,
I
was
able
to
adapt
to
this
foreign
style
of
writing.
My
FYW
was
the
first
English
class
in
years
that
I
truly
enjoyed
and
actually
improved
my
writing.
After
surviving
two
college
English
courses
I
took
a
semester
off,
only
to
be
slapped
with
my
hardest
English
class
yet
in
the
spring
of
my
sophomore
year.
In
many
ways
my
VAST
was
easy.
We
did
lots
of
class
discussions
and
our
only
consistent
outside
work
was
reading
the
required
articles
for
each
class.
What
made
this
course
challenging
was
that
pairs
of
students
were
assigned
topics
upon
which
they
were
to
become
experts.
We
were
expected
to
continually
research
the
topics
in
preparation
for
our
presentations,
which
occurred
sporadically
throughout
the
semester.
In
addition
to
the
presentation,
we
each
wrote
a
manuscript
on
some
aspect
of
our
topic.
The
tricky
part
about
this
paper
was
that
before
turning
it
into
the
professor
for
grading,
the
WA
gave
us
feedback
as
well,
so
that
we
revised
it
about
six
times.
It
was
an
ongoing
process
that
I
often
found
quite
painful.
For
the
first
time,
I
received
a
graded
paper
in
which
the
margins
were
actually
covered
with
comments.
What
really
appalled
me,
though,
was
that
the
professor
actually
questioned
the
validity
of
some
of
my
statements.
I
wasn't
sure
how
to
react
to
her
doubts.
After
speaking
with
her,
however,
I
realized
that
she
was
merely
pointing
out
options
I
had
ignored
or
mentioning
alternative
directions
in
which
to
carry
the
paper.
When
I
read
over
my
paper
and
considered
the
myriad
of
criticisms,
I
couldn't
help
but
expect
to
see
a
poor
grade
on
the
last
page.
As
it
turned
out,
I
actually
did
well
on
the
paper.
Each
time
I
submitted
the
paper
to
the
professor,
it
returned
covered
in
comments
and
carrying
a
good
grade.
I
learned
many
things
from
this
experience.
First,
I
realized
that
in
biology
(it
was
a
biology
based
VAST)
one
must
be
a
critical
reader
and
only
believe
what
the
author
can
prove.
I
also
found
that
a
written
work,
despite
the
grade
it
earns
or
the
number
of
previous
revisions,
can
always
be
improved.
There
were
definitely
times
that
I
complained
about
the
amount
of
work
I
had
to
put
into
that
paper,
but
I
feel
the
experience
really
prepared
me
for
a
future
in
biological
research.
That
preparation
alone
makes
the
entire
process
worthwhile.
I
think
it
is
only
appropriate
to
end
my
literary
history
with
a
short
explanation
of
why
I
decided
to
apply
for
a
position
as
a
WA.
As
I
have
indirectly
stated
throughout
this
narrative,
I
have
always
known
that
I
can
write.
I
just
never
liked
it.
Realizing
that
I
have
a
long
life
of
writing
ahead
of
me,
being
a
WA
was
partially
my
conscious
decision
to
improve
my
attitude
toward
writing,
as
well
as
my
writing
itself.
The
WA
position
also
allowed
me
to
satisfy
my
craving
to
help
others.
I
have
been
a
peer
tutor
in
the
past
and
really
enjoy
helping
students
improve
their
performance
in
the
classroom.
I
wish
I
could
have
said
that
I
have
always
loved
writing,
but
that
just
isn't
the
case.
Hopefully,
my
literary
history
is
more
interesting
because
of
my
lack
of
enthusiasm.
At
any
rate,
I
am
looking
forward
to
an
educational,
enlightening,
and
enjoyable
semester
as
a
WA.
