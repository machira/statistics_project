Literacy
Narrative
August
27,
1999
I
wore
a
little
plaid
jumper,
baby
blue
blouse
and
saddle
shoes,
looking
like
a
perfect
catholic
school
student
with
my
ribbon
tied
pigtails
swinging
behind
me
as
I
bounded
off
for
kindergarten
at
Saint
Genevieve
School.
It
was
not
the
first
day
of
school
(hence
my
arrogant
lack
of
apprehension),
but
it
was
sometime
in
the
beginning
of
the
school
year;
the
day
we
would
work
on...the
alphabet.
Yes,
it
was
a
big
day
for
me
because
I
was
sure
that
I
already
knew
some
of
this
supposed
alphabet
and
wondered
what
this
teacher
could
really
have
to
show
me
that
I
did
not
already
know.
Well,
I
learned
my
lesson
that
day,
and
I
do
not
just
mean
the
alphabet.
Writing
letters
in
the
way
that
the
teacher
wanted
was
not
as
easy
as
the
way
I
chose
to
write
them.
I
thought
that
my
salvation
had
come
when
I
realized
that
writing
letters
of
the
alphabet
in
kindergarten
is
very
elementary
and
limited
primarily
to
the
basic
shape
of
each
letter.
Then
we
practiced
the
spelling
of
our
own
name.
My
difficulty
with
writing
lie
primarily
in
the
writing
of
my
rather
daunting
and
wordy
name:
Mary-Jo
Elizabeth
McGoldrick.
It
is
still
daunting
to
me
considering
that
now
whenever
I
am
asked
to
say
or
spell
my
name
I
go
by
the
shortened
version,
M.J.,
instead
of
the
longer
name
Mary-Jo.
This
is
no
doubt
a
result
of
traumatic
experiences
with
writing
my
verbose
name
as
a
child
and
needing
to
make
it
as
short
and
simple
as
possible.
As
the
other
children
were
arrogantly
sauntering
up
to
the
blackboard
to
jot
down
their
pithy
names,
I
cowered
in
my
seat
at
the
prospect
of
writing
out
my
lengthy
first
name.
So
goes
the
story
of
one
of
my
earliest
experiences
with
writing,
I
assure
you
that
it
gets
much
less
tragic
as
the
years
progress.
As
I
continued
in
my
growth
both
physically
and
mentally
so
grew
my
ever
deepening
desire
for
grand
accomplishments
in
all
things
most
especially
reading
and
writing.
Soon,
through
much
practice
and
determination,
writing
my
name
correctly
was
no
longer
a
problem.
Now
it
was
first
grade
and
that
meant
serious
business.
Sentences
and
phonics
exercises,
no
more
of
this
kindergarten
nonsense
of
forming
letters!
Pressures
really
began
to
set
in
about
being
able
to
prepare
a
sentence
to
hand
in
to
the
teacher...my
first
writer's
anxiety!
This
stage
carried
on
for
quite
a
few
years
as
I
aged
and
my
writing
skills
improved.
Writing
demands
did
however
change
over
the
years.
Soon
it
was
homework
assignments
requiring
me
to
write
about
something
I
have
read
or
to
detail
an
event
or
something
about
myself.
This
was
a
time
in
school
for
journal
writing.
When
I
envision
this
stage
as
a
writer
I
see
stories
of
spotted
puppies
or
stories
recalling
how
my
rotten
older
brother
had
used
my
toothbrush
to
scrub
the
bathroom
floor.
My
school
was
very
supportive
of
the
idea
that
writing
is
good
in
any
form
as
long
as
it
is
writing.
So
the
teacher
assigned
a
journal
project.
She
told
us
to
write
stories
we
did
not
mind
others
reading
and
to
use
it
to
practice
our
writing
and
grammar
while
having
fun
with
journal
writing.
Sometimes
we
embellished
the
stories
to
make
them
more
reader-friendly,
but
that
just
added
to
our
learning
experience.
I
learned
that
embellishment
was
not
simply
a
handy
tool
but
truly
an
art.
Adding
the
correct
adjectives
to
a
sentence
really
was
the
difference
between
a
journal
that
the
teacher
read
aloud
and
one
that
stayed
in
the
pile.
We
all
wanted
ours
to
be
the
one
read
aloud,
so
we
filled
them
with
juicy
details
of
wild
stories.
I
learned
that
writing
is
about
presentation,
it
is
a
reflection
of
yourself.
The
teachers
knew
that
the
journal
entries
were
fictional
and
accepted
them
as
such
while
being
grateful
for
our
desire
to
write
them
and
devote
time
to
their
perfection.
Our
use
of
grammar
shown
through
all
of
our
fancy
adjectives
as
did
our
grasp
of
writing
essentials.
Our
writing
became
more
academic
as
I
was
in
fifth
and
sixth
grade.
We
progressed
to
paragraph
long
reports
on
state
flowers,
or
the
history
of
the
flag
of
the
United
States.
This
type
of
writing
involved
research
and
more
thought
to
organization
which
was
much
more
difficult
than
the
fictional
writing
of
journal
entries.
Two
very
important
writing
assignments
came
into
my
life
shortly
thereafter.
One
occurred
during
the
entrance
exam
for
my
high
school.
I
was
asked
to
write
a
short
essay
about
myself
and
why
I
thought
that
I
could
excel
at
the
Academy.
To
me
this
translated
to
an
explanation
of
my
family
and
a
few
comments
about
my
experiences
in
lower
school,
then
on
to
why
I
was
the
perfect
candidate
for
admittance
to
the
Academy.
It
was
not
until
long
after
my
admittance
that
I
realized
they
were
looking
for
something
more
meaningful
about
me
as
a
person,
and
less
about
the
logistics
of
my
family.
I
was
not
ready
as
a
writer
to
analyze
and
describe
myself
in
detail.
I
ran
into
this
same
problem
again
when
the
eighth
grade
teacher
presented
us
with
the
final
project
of
the
year
entitled
Me,
Myself,
and
I.
We
were
to
write
on
the
details
of
our
lives
from
birth
to
eighth
grade.
This
major
assignment
included
demands
for
collages,
photos,
and
intricate
details
from
being
baby-sat
to
being
the
baby-sitter.
This,
a
major
challenge,
worsened
by
the
fact
that
we
were
still
using
type-writers
to
write,
created
quite
a
stir
in
the
eighth
grade.
I
toiled
for
weeks
and
weeks
to
complete
my
project
while
making
sure
it
was
zesty,
colorful
and
entertaining.
What
happened
next
has
scarred
me
as
a
writer
and
as
a
student.
It
was
a
damp
cold
spring
day
as
I
carried
my
precious
project
into
school.
I
noticed
that
one
of
the
girls
in
my
class
had
a
large
poster
board
and
wondered
about
it,
so
I
asked
her.
She
replied
with
a
snide
comment
that
everyone
had
used
poster
boards
in
their
presentations
and
she
asked
why
I
did
not
have
one.
I
nearly
cried
from
embarrassment
when
I
saw
that
she
and
the
other
students
in
the
class
had
neatly
decorated
large
poster
boards
with
pictures
and
witty
captions
of
events.
Poster
boards
were
not
part
of
the
assignment
but
each
of
the
students
had
decided
to
do
this
to
enhance
the
project
while
the
stories
of
my
witty
jaunts
through
life
were
confined
within
the
bars
of
a
piece
of
typing
paper.
I
vowed
then
to
never
again
be
confined
in
my
writing,
to
always
think
a
project
through
before
beginning
it
and
to
always
let
my
imagination
enter
into
what
I
write.
When
I
entered
high
school
with
this
renewed
sense
of
self
as
a
writer
it
was
promptly
knocked
down.
The
high
school
I
attended
is
very
competitive
and
prides
itself
on
turning
out
graduates
who
can
write
well.
This
is
not
a
magical
process
however,
it
requires
wiping
out
everything
one
knows
about
writing
and
starting
from
scratch.
It
is
a
rebuilding
of
sorts,
throughout
the
four
years
of
high
school
more
layers
of
knowledge
and
experience
are
piled
onto
you
until
finally
you
are
ready
to
leave
with
a
new
coat
of
armor
to
protect
and
aid
you.
Junior
year
of
high
school
stands
out
particularly
in
my
mind
as
one
of
particularly
challenging
writing.
Everyone
feared
having
the
very
strict
and
demanding
Sister
Christi.
On
the
door
to
class
room
hung
a
quote
from
Dante's
Inferno
warning
us
to
fear
her
class.
Throughout
the
course,
we
were
assigned
several
three
paragraph
essays.
One
particular
instance
stands
out
in
my
mind,
we
were
to
write
an
essay
regarding
the
local
election
occurring
at
the
time
and
could
not
repeat
any
word
throughout
the
entire
essay
including
the
names
of
the
candidates.
This
was
quite
a
task
for
me
and
took
me
a
good
bit
of
time
to
complete.
I
remember
this
experience
as
though
it
were
yesterday
because
it
was
so
challenging
and
forced
me
to
learn
so
much
so
quickly.
Sister
Christi
was
very
strict
that
we
not
use
any
passive
voice
in
our
essays
and
would
very
happily
fail
students
if
they
used
passive
voice.
After
completing
Sister
Christi's
class
no
graduate
of
that
school
has
an
excuse
for
poor
writing
skills;
we
were
taught
very
well
and
it
is
important
to
maintain
those
skills
and
put
them
to
good
use.
Of
course
I
am
no
were
near
having
perfected
the
art
of
writing,
I
am
very
much
still
a
student
who
makes
mistakes
and
needs
to
learn
continuously.
My
college
essays
were
the
most
important
pieces
of
writing
in
my
life
because
they
had
such
a
great
effect
on
my
life.
While
I
wrote
those
essays
I
felt
as
though
my
life
hung
in
the
balance.
What
I
wrote
could
determine
the
next
four
years
of
my
life.
My
application
to
Lafayette
included
an
essay
detailing
my
experiences
going
to
World
Youth
Day
1993
in
Colorado.
World
Youth
Day
was
a
gathering
of
young
people
celebrating
the
arrival
of
the
Pope
in
the
United
States.
While
there,
the
Pope
spoke
to
the
crowd
and
celebrated
a
mass.
I
used
the
mystical
nature
of
the
event
to
weave
a
wondrous
tale
for
my
essay
and
convey
the
intensity
of
the
situation.
As
I
look
back
at
my
copy
of
that
essay
now
I
see
how
I
could
have
improved
upon
it,
however
that
is
because
I
have
learned
so
much
since
then.
That
essay
may
have
helped
me
get
into
college
but
it
certainly
did
not
help
me
once
I
was
there.
When
I
arrived
at
Lafayette
my
writing
skills
were
strong,
maybe
not
as
strong
as
I
thought,
but
still
strong.
I
went
into
my
First
Year
Seminar
with
confidence
in
my
skills
as
a
writer.
I
soon
found
that
what
a
professor
wants
to
read
and
what
you
think
she
wants
to
read
can
be
two
very
different
things.
College
writing
is
much
more
complicated
than
high
school
writing,
it
requires
much
thought
and
reworking
in
order
to
produce
a
product
that
is
acceptable
to
the
professor.
I
also
found
that
my
professor
in
FYS
demanded
more
thinking
and
analysis
from
the
students.
This
need
for
deep
thought
was
a
distinct
change
from
high
school
writing
which
was
more
related
to
perfecting
the
grammar
and
form
of
writing.
I
learned
much
not
only
about
college
writing
but
also
about
college
itself
during
the
First
Year
Seminar.
I
honed
my
thinking
skills
which
had
been
dulled
by
four
years
of
following
patterns
in
high
school,
I
allowed
my
brain
to
have
the
space
to
expand
in
the
many
new
directions
that
college
had
shown.
I
took
my
experience
from
my
First
Year
Seminar
and
carried
it
on
to
my
classes
in
Sophomore
year.
I
consider
first
semester
Sophomore
year
to
be
one
of
the
most
difficult,
most
especially
in
terms
of
writing.
I
took
my
first
Political
Theory
class
and
realized
that
all
previously
learned
rules
about
writing
were
out
of
the
question.
Writing
theory
has
it's
own
rules
about
the
set
up
and
wording
of
a
paper.
I
felt
as
though
this
class
removed
my
brain
from
my
head,
stomped
on
it,
twisted
it
around
and
then
put
it
back.
Needless
to
say,
this
class
challenged
me
to
think
and
write
in
a
new
way
and
at
the
time
this
was
quite
daunting.
I
did
however
step
away
from
the
class
with
a
new
understanding
and
respect
for
theory
writing
and
any
other
writing
that
challenges
standards.
Junior
year
of
college
presented
me
with
a
formidable
challenge
that
I
had
to
overcome
in
order
to
pass
a
class.
I
took
a
law
class
which
required
as
part
of
an
exam
each
of
the
students
to
prepare
a
mock
supreme
court
decision.
We
were
given
the
facts
of
the
case
and
then
needed
to
produce
a
decision
and
back
up
our
decision
with
precedence
from
other
cases
in
order
to
prove
that
our
decision
was
correct.
This
is
the
most
difficult
form
of
writing
that
I
have
ever
come
into
contact
with.
I
struggled
to
word
each
decision
just
right
and
to
back
up
each
claim
with
a
valid
argument
from
the
cases
that
I
had
memorized.
This
class
introduced
me
to
argumentative
writing,
which
is
something
that
I
feel
will
benefit
me
so
much
in
the
future.
My
experiences
with
writing
over
the
years
have
prepared
me
well
for
my
future.
I
feel
that
I
have
grown
significantly
over
the
years
as
writer,
most
especially
in
college
which
was
a
result
of
the
crucial
things
I
learned
about
writing
while
in
high
school.
Learning
to
be
a
good
or
even
great
writer
takes
time
and
I
willingly
admit
that
I
am
very
much
still
a
student
and
always
will
be.
I
wish
that
I
may
continue
to
learn
and
that
I
apply
my
new
knowledge
to
all
of
my
writing
endeavors.
