When
I
was
a
young
girl,
my
parents
would
read
to
me
every
night.
My
favorite
bedtime
stories
came
from
the
Laura
Ingalls
Wilder
series.
I
would
listen
to
her
accounts
of
growing
up
and
think
about
the
day
when
I
too
would
write
books
about
my
life.
However,
once
I
had
listened
to
all
the
books
in
the
series,
I
decided
I
wanted
new
stories
and
would
request
that
my
parents
make
up
new
stories
for
me.
I
loved
the
stories
that
my
parents
would
create
because
they
were
always
interactive.
Rather
than
strict
narration,
they
would
pause
from
time
to
time
and
ask
me
what
would
happen
next.
Although
I
wasn't
actually
writing,
this
was
my
first
encounter
with
creating
stories.
I
had
to
think
about
what
events
fit
into
the
context
of
the
story
and
whether
or
not
what
I
was
saying
made
sense.
Those
nights
had
more
influence
on
my
future
as
a
writer
than
I
realized
at
the
time.
By
the
time
that
I
was
in
second
grade,
my
mother
had
recognized
my
love
of
writing
and
bought
me
my
first
typewriter.
Some
of
the
earliest
things
that
I
typed
were
poems
about
dolphins,
unicorns,
and
princesses.
I
also
started
to
write
stories.
One
of
my
favorite
stories
was
written
from
the
perspective
of
a
popcorn
kernel
who
had
escaped
being
popped
and
had
to
adapt
to
life
on
the
streets
before
befriending
the
influential
Kernel
Sanders.
Before
long,
I
had
learned
how
to
write
in
cursive
and
decided
that
I
would
write
all
my
stories
down
in
cursive
before
I
typed
them
so
that
I
could
show
off
my
grown
up
handwriting.
At
this
time
I
had
become
addicted
to
Nancy
Drew
novels
and
started
to
write
constantly
about
mysteries.
Everywhere
I
went
I
would
look
for
ideas
for
my
stories,
afterall,
I
had
to
consider
means,
motives,
and
above
all,
mysteries.
By
the
time
I
reached
fourth
grade,
I
had
decided
that
I
wanted
to
be
a
writer.
I
began
my
first
book,
Anna
Comes
Home.
About
a
gaunt
ten
year-old
girl
who
traveled
the
prairie
with
her
pioneer
family,
this
book
was
to
be
the
greatest
literary
accomplishment
of
any
fourth
grade
student
in
history.
That
was,
of
course,
until
I
lost
interest
and
moved
on
to
different
forms
of
writing.
In
school,
I
was
given
an
assignment
about
courage.
I
was
supposed
to
answer
a
few
questions
and
then
write
a
few
sentences
about
heroes.
Instead,
I
wrote
three
pages;
my
teacher
was
thrilled
with
my
essay
and
read
it
aloud
to
the
class
before
hanging
it
up
on
the
chalkboard
(where
it
stayed
for
the
rest
of
the
school
year).
This
moment
was
important
to
me;
it
was
the
first
time
that
I
can
recall
receiving
such
praise
from
a
teacher
for
a
piece
of
my
writing.
Up
to
that
point
I
had
actually
disliked
the
class
because
the
teacher
was
strict
and
rarely
had
anything
positive
to
say
to
the
students.
I
realized
that
if
I
could
impress
her
I
might
actually
have
the
potential
to
become
a
successful
writer.
That
summer
I
began
writing
and
illustrating
a
book
of
short
stories
forchildren.
I
would
spend
nearly
every
day
working
on
my
book.
I
decided
that
I
could
have
even
more
fun
if
I
could
get
other
people
involved
with
me.
Thus,
I
started
a
summer
writing
club.
Although
there
were
only
three
members,
(all
of
whom
were
family)
we
took
the
club
very
seriously.
Each
member
had
to
completeat
least
only
story,
with
pictures,
every
week.
By
the
time
that
fifth
grade
rolled
around
I
was
very
enthusiastic
about
writing.
I
looked
for
every
opportunity
I
could
find
to
incorporate
writing
with
my
regular
schoolwork,
(offering
to
write
the
report
part
for
group
projects
and
opting
take
on
extra
writing
assignments
when
I
finished
ahead
of
schedule).
I
would
even
peer-edit
the
papers
of
fellow
students
before
they
would
write
their
final
drafts
for
the
teacher.
My
teacher
was
very
pleased
with
my
abilities
and
nominated
me
to
become
a
member
of
the
school
magazine.
This
group
was
very
select,
as
every
member
had
to
be
initially
recommended
by
a
teacher
and
then
apply.
I
was
one
of
only
three
fifth
grade
students
chosen
to
be
a
staff
member.
During
my
time
with
the
magazine,
I
acted
as
a
writer
and
an
editor.
Every
week,
while
the
other
students
had
Activity
time,
(an
hour-long
period
to
play
sports,
make
crafts,
etc.)
I
would
edit
the
pieces
of
writing
that
had
been
nominated
to
appear
in
the
magazine.
It
was
a
great
deal
of
work
and
I
can
recall
feeling
both
sadness
and
relief
when
it
was
finally
over.
At
the
end
of
my
fifth
grade
year,
my
class
was
asked
to
assess
what
they
liked
and
disliked
about
the
way
writing
was
taught
at
our
school.
Although
I
can't
recall
what
it
was
that
I
didn't
like,
I
remember
that
my
favorite
thing
about
writing
in
school
was
open-ended
assignments.
I
loved
being
told
to
just
write
and
felt
stifled
when
there
were
too
many
requirements
about
how
or
what
I
should
write.
In
sixth
grade,
I
became
an
insatiable
reader.
I
read
nearly
every
classic
novel
I
could
get
my
hands
on,
always
seeking
to
find
a
bigger,
harder,
more
impressive
book.
My
constant
reading
changed
my
writing
style
greatly.
I
learned
how
to
better
develop
characters
and
settings,
as
well
as
incorporate
irony
and
humor.
Of
course,
I
still
had
traces
of
my
old
self--one
of
my
more
memorable
stories
being
told
from
the
perspective
of
penny
who
had
survived
a
plane
crash
and
sought
to
scour
the
plane
for
other
spared
change.
I
also
wrote
my
first
two
research
papers
that
year.
I
wrote
the
first
on
the
devastating
effect
that
lack
of
genetic
diversity
had
on
cheetahs
and
the
second
on
the
so-called
Curse
of
Queen
Hatshepsut.
The
feedback
that
I
received
was
overwhelmingly
encouraging
and
I
decided
that
with
every
passing
year
I
would
attempt
to
write
the
most
interesting
and
well-written
research
papers
of
any
of
my
peers.
The
following
year,
I
was
given
the
opportunity
to
write
a
seven-page
research
paper
on
any
topic
of
my
choice,
provided
that
it
was
controversial.
It
took
me
longer
than
most
of
the
other
students
because
I
wanted
to
find
the
most
unusual
topic
in
the
class;
I
wanted
a
topic
that
the
teacher
had
never
dealt
with
before.
I
chose
The
Physical
Benefits
of
Biomagnetic
Therapy.
I
received
not
only
the
highest
grade
in
the
class
for
my
paper,
but
also
the
highest
grade
for
my
presentation
to
the
class,
which
was
graded
by
the
students
themselves.
Outside
of
school,
however,
I
was
writing
far
less
than
in
the
past.
I
had
written
a
two
page
introduction
to
a
story,
but
could
not
think
of
a
way
to
continue
it.
I
absolutely
loved
my
introduction
and
it
seemed
to
have
a
great
deal
of
potential,
but
I
could
think
of
no
plot
that
would
do
it
justice.
It
would
take
me
two
years
until
I
would
finish
it.
Eighth
grade
came
and
I
began
writing
papers
nearly
every
week
in
English
class.
I
was
displeased,
however,
with
the
emphasis
on
what
I
considered
to
be
trivial
elements
of
writing.
Papers
were
graded
on
such
things
as
the
ability
to
stay
within
the
margins,
uses
of
three
or
more
helping
verbs,
and
correct
writing
format.
It
seemed
to
me
that
if
you
followed
all
the
requirements
for
a
given
paper,
you
could
receive
a
good
grade
for
something
that
was
poorly
written.
The
impact
that
this
had
on
me
was
rather
detrimental;
I
no
longer
had
enjoyed
writing
and
it
began
to
seem
more
and
more
like
work.
That
year
I
joined
the
yearbook
staff
so
I
could
write
with
a
little
more
freedom.
I
also
earned
Honorable
Mention
in
the
eighth
grade
writing
competition.
We
were
given
the
topic
I
learned
the
hard
way."
I
can
recall
really
resenting
that
topic.
I
couldn't
think
of
anything
impressive
that
I
had
learned
the
hard
way
(at
the
time
I
tried
to
incorporate
deeper
ideas
into
my
writing
and
thus
didn't
think
a
reader
would
gain
much
from
an
essay
such
as
I
Learned
the
Hard
Way
Not
to
Climb
Trees
in
the
Rain").
In
the
end,
I
wrote
about
how
the
death
of
my
grandfather
taught
me
never
to
take
people
for
granted.
Although
the
idea
was
a
bit
cliche,
I
put
my
heart
into
the
paper
and
it
was
one
of
only
two
writing
assignments
that
I
enjoyed
that
year.
My
freshman
year
of
high
school
promised
to
be
torturous,
as
I
had
signed
up
for
a
creative
writing
class,
but
no
longer
had
the
same
drive
to
write.
Luckily,
I
found
that
things
had
changed
since
the
eighth
grade.
Grades
were
based
upon
the
quality
of
writing
and
assignments
were
open
to
interpretation.
I
was
able
to
write
poems,
research
papers,
short
stories,
journals,
and
nearly
any
other
form
of
writing
I
wanted.
One
of
my
favorite
past
times
became
writing
notes
to
friends.
I
wouldn't
write
typical
Do
you
know
who
so
and
so
is
dating?
notes,
but
rather
20
page
notes
involving
interactive
stories.
I
called
upon
memories
of
my
childhood
bedtime
stories
and
would
give
my
reader
breaks
in
the
story
at
which
they
were
to
choose
how
the
story
would
continue
based
upon
a
list
of
multiple
choice
options.
I
would
then
have
to
write
dozens
of
variations
and
endings
for
a
single
story.
During
my
sophomore
year
in
high
school,
my
friends
encouraged
me
to
join
the
Forensics
team.
I
selected
Original
Oratory
as
my
area
of
concentration.
I
wrote
a
ten-minute
speech
about
the
contiguousness
of
yawning,
memorized
it,
and
would
compete
against
other
students
from
other
schools
every
Saturday.
My
first
Forensics
meet
was
incredibly
nerve-wracking,
but
I
managed
to
win
second
place.
I
have
to
admit,
I
grew
to
love
performing
my
speech
just
to
watch
the
audience
try
to
hold
back
their
yawns
while
I
discussed
how
just
the
mere
thought
of
a
yawn
is
enough
to
trigger
one
in
most
people.
This
was
also
the
year
that
I
had
write
my
first
extensive
research
paper.
I
wrote
about
covert
CIA
research
into
the
world
of
remote
viewing,
a
form
of
extra-sensory
espionage.
I
received
the
highest
research
paper
grade
of
any
tenth
grade
students
that
year--a
trend
that
would
continue
with
every
research
paper
until
graduation.
The
next
year,
I
continued
performing
original
oratories
with
the
Forensics
team
and
I
joined
the
yearbook
staff.
Although
I
still
had
not
regained
my
former
drive
for
writing,
I
decided
that
I
wanted
to
go
into
journalism.
I
believed
that
I
could
use
my
love
of
writing
to
help
change
the
world
or
at
least
small
parts
of
it.
I
pursued
this
dream
a
little
bit
when
I
joined
my
school's
Energy
Debate
team.
Comprised
of
four
seniors
and
one
junior
aside
from
myself,
the
team
had
to
research
and
prepare
debate
cases
on
both
sides
of
the
issue
of
renewable
energy.
We
worked
all
year
preparing
the
cases
and
although
the
other
junior
and
I
were
only
alternate
members
were
still
did
a
good
deal
of
writing.
Then,
the
night
before
the
state
championship,
one
of
the
members
got
sick
and
I
was
called
to
replace
them.
This
meant
I
had
to
write
my
own
version
of
her
case
and
memorize
it
by
morning.
The
next
day,
I
was
given
her
notes
and
a
few
minutes
incorporate
them
into
the
case
that
I
had
already
written.
Our
team
wound
up
winning
the
championship.
My
senior
year
of
high
school
found
me
in
AP
English
class,
writing
a
five-page
paper
every
week.
I
devised
a
way
to
make
writing
a
little
more
interesting
for
myself.
I
would
randomly
pick
a
person,
object,
or
event
and
then
challenge
myself
to
incorporate
my
choice
into
the
introduction
of
my
paper.
The
goal
was
to
find
a
connection
and
seamlessly
connect
it
to
my
topic
so
that
it
would
not
seem
unusual
or
out
of
place
to
the
reader
at
all.
For
example,
a
paper
about
Moby
Dick's
Queequeg
might
have
begun
with
a
discussion
on
the
foul
smelling,
yet
delicious
Thai
fruit,
the
durian.
This
would
then
lead
to
a
twist
on
the
classic
don't
judge
a
book
by
it's
cover
idea
which
would
then
introduce
Queequeg.
My
teacher
was
so
pleased
with
my
work
that
she
would
have
me
edit
papers
for
her
and
it
was
required
that
students
had
to
take
their
first
drafts
of
papers
either
to
herself
or
to
me
before
they
could
proceed
with
further
drafts.
Although
I
continued
compete
in
Forensics,
my
senior
year
I
switched
categories
and
began
competing
in
Impromptu
Speaking
(in
which
I
was
given
a
word
and
had
five
minutes
to
prepare
a
speech)
and
Extemporaneous
Speaking
(in
which
I
was
given
a
more
complex
topic
and
had
thirty
minutes
to
prepare
a
speech).
Although
there
was
more
pressure
on
me
than
I
had
faced
in
Original
Oratory,
I
was
glad
to
be
free
from
the
monotony
of
giving
the
same
speech
week
after
week.
During
this
time
I
was
again
a
member
of
the
Energy
Debate
team,
this
year
the
topic
was
the
reuse
of
brownfields.
Because
I
was
the
only
returning
member
on
the
team,
I
had
a
greater
work
load
than
I
had
had
the
previous
year
and
had
to
write
not
only
my
own
section
of
the
case,
but
also
parts
of
my
teammates'
cases.
This
year
we
again
made
it
to
the
state
finals,
but
came
in
second
place.
With
my
senior
year
quickly
winding
down
I
began
to
think
about
my
future.
I
decided
that
while
I
still
enjoyed
writing,
it
was
no
longer
what
I
wanted
to
do
with
the
rest
of
my
life.
I
graduated
with
the
highest
English
average
in
my
class,
just
days
after
deciding
that
I
no
longer
wanted
to
become
an
English
major
in
college.
When
I
first
arrived
at
Lafayette
for
orientation,
I
planned
on
still
being
involved
with
writing,
whether
on
the
newspaper
staff
or
with
the
forensics
team.
Then
I
learned
about
the
WA
program.
From
the
start
I
knew
that
this
was
something
I
wanted
to
do.
I
would
even
sit
through
my
own
WA
meetings
thinking
about
how
I
would
approach
a
student
with
a
similar
paper.
I
was
able
to
put
my
ideas
into
practice
during
the
second
semester
when
most
of
my
friends
were
taking
freshman
English
classes
and
would
ask
for
advice
on
their
papers.
I
have
found
that
through
helping
other
people
with
their
writing,
I
can
learn
new
things
about
my
own
writing.
I
await
this
upcoming
year
with
great
anticipation
because
I
feel
that
being
a
WA
will
enable
me
to
grow
as
a
writer
and
possibly
restore
my
love
of
writing.
