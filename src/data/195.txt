WA
Paper
My
association
with
the
written
word
began
long
before
I
can
remember.
Even
before
I
learned
how
to
write
'C
is
for
cat',
the
English
language
had
become
a
part
of
my
life
in
the
form
of
stories
my
mother
used
to
read
out
to
me.
I
come
from
India
where
English
is
not
the
national
language,
but
as
a
legacy
of
British
colonialism,
is
widely
spoken
throughout
the
country.
It
serves
as
a
linguistic
bond
that
unites
people
of
different
cultures
who
speak
different
languages.
Most
urban
school-going
children
learn
how
to
read
and
write
English
to
varying
levels
of
proficiency.
As
a
result,
although
I
can
speak,
read
and
write
in
Hindi,
I
am
most
proficient
in
English.
This
was
often
a
source
of
astonishment
for
many
American
students
when
I
first
came
to
Lafayette.
For
the
first
several
years
of
my
schooling,
I
was
made
to
write
with
a
pencil
on
ruled
notebook
paper.
Neatness,
word
spacing
and
indentation
of
paragraphs
were
aspects
that
were
stressed
upon.
In
lower
classes,
there
was
not
much
scope
for
writing
creatively.
We
were
made
to
study
subjects
like
English
language
and
literature,
history,
geography
and
science
with
English
as
the
medium
of
instruction.
In
most
of
the
subjects
except
English
language,
writing
consisted
of
copying
answers
that
the
teacher
dictated.
This
material
to
be
copied
was
usually
in
vast
amounts
and
the
time
provided
was
short.
I
think
it
is
from
this
period
that
I
picked
up
the
habit
of
fast
note
taking
and
also
the
period
where
my
handwriting
deteriorated
considerably.
The
only
scope
for
writing
creatively
presented
itself
when
we
were
required
to
write
an
unprepared
essay
or
an
autobiography
of
an
object.
I
have
one
memory
of
an
interesting
assignment.
I
was
made
to
maintain
a
journal
with
descriptions
of
events
of
current
interest.
I
wrote
about
the
monsoons,
about
a
television
serial
and
about
a
festival.
I
was
also
allowed
to
stick
pictures
next
to
my
descriptions.
As
I
grew
up,
the
syllabus
became
more
rigid,
but
the
scope
for
writing
creatively
expanded
a
little.
We
could
now
write
our
own
answers
instead
of
copying
from
dictation.
I
recall
writing
long
answers
analyzing
some
character
in
a
story,
or
writing
an
essay
on
the
'quality
of
mercy'
after
reading
the
'Merchant
Of
Venice'
or
on
the
'seven
stages
of
man'
after
reading
'As
You
Like
It'.
By
this
time
I
had
graduated
from
writing
with
pencils
and
had
become
the
proud
owner
of
a
fountain
pen
which
I
later
discarded
for
a
smooth
and
fast
ball
point
pen.
During
this
entire
period
I
have
described,
I
never
really
thought
about
my
writing.
Spelling
was
stressed
upon
but
grammar
was
largely
ignored.
English
was
taught
not
as
a
language
with
grammatical
rules
but
rather
as
a
tool
for
learning
literature.
Hence,
my
style
of
writing
is
a
result
of
reading
a
lot
and
not
as
a
result
of
learning
the
rules
of
grammar.
This
pattern
changed
when
I
reached
the
eleventh
standard.
I
moved
to
a
new
school
and
for
some
reason
writing
now
became
an
effort
for
me.
I
received
my
first
shock
when
I
got
two
marks
out
of
ten
on
an
assignment.
The
assignment
involved
some
sort
of
an
analysis
on
my
personality.
I
think
the
self-analysis
overwhelmed
me,
and
the
result
was
the
outpouring
of
a
confused
mind.
After
that
episode,
I
started
to
think
more
about
my
writing.
I
had
a
long
talk
with
my
teacher
who
gave
me
some
suggestions
on
how
to
proceed
with
the
assignment.
I
started
to
spend
more
time
and
effort
on
my
writing
assignments.
My
style
changed.
It
became
more
clear
and
easy
to
understand.
I
learned
to
get
to
the
heart
of
the
matter.
I
continued
to
write
a
lot
for
class,
analyzing
poems
and
characters
that
we
studied
about
in
plays
and
stories.
Despite
this
long
history
as
a
writer,
I
had
never
really
written
anything
creative
till
I
came
to
college.
All
the
writing
I
had
done
had
to
do
with
the
works
of
some
author.
Even
essays
were
echoes
of
my
views
and
not
a
product
of
my
imagination.
I
got
my
first
taste
of
creative
writing
when
I
took
my
First
Year
Seminar
course
at
Lafayette.
I
had
to
write
two
papers.
The
assignments
were
challenging,
as
they
had
to
be
informative
and
imaginative
at
the
same
time.
The
first
one
involved
narrating
a
conversation
between
five
characters
who
had
just
seen
a
performance
of
a
play.
The
play
was
one
that
we
had
studied
in
class.
Each
of
the
five
characters
were
followers
of
famous
thinkers
whom
we
had
studied
about
and
hence
subscribers
to
a
particular
ideology.
I
had
to
incorporate
historically
factual
information
in
an
entertaining,
yet
believable
conversation.
This
exercise
was
one
of
the
most
challenging
and
fulfilling
assignments
I
have
worked
on.
The
second
paper
involved
interviewing
the
ghosts
of
certain
famous
people
we
had
studied
about.
In
this
paper
too
I
could
let
my
imagination
run
free
while
making
use
of
historical
data.
My
first
attempt
at
writing
a
research
paper
was
made
at
Lafayette
too.
I
found
the
whole
process
very
exciting.
At
first
I
was
a
little
confused
about
the
warnings
we
received
regarding
plagiarism.
The
research
paper
was
a
factual
one.
There
was
no
scope
for
using
my
imagination.
I
could
not
change
facts.
If
facts
were
facts,
how
different
from
the
source
could
I
present
it?
I
always
felt
that
the
way
the
source
explained
something
was
the
easiest
way
to
explain
that
particular
concept
and
I
could
rarely
explain
it
in
a
simpler
way.
However,
my
professor
insisted
that
the
way
to
go
about
such
a
paper,
was
to
read
all
the
material,
absorb
and
understand
it,
and
then
write
the
paper
in
my
own
words.
The
experience
was
one
that
I
enjoyed
very
much.
I
learnt
how
to
read
complex
material
and
break
it
down
into
simple
concepts.
I
also
learnt
how
to
use
the
MLA
format
of
citation.
My
writing
experience
in
college
has
been
very
different
from
that
in
school
in
terms
of
the
kinds
of
writing
that
I
have
been
made
to
do.
I
do
not
feel
that
I
have
raised
the
level
of
my
language,
but
in
several
ways
I
feel
more
confident
as
a
writer.
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
write
a
research
paper
and
a
creative
paper.
I
feel
that
as
a
writer,
the
challenge
for
me
has
been
in
using
my
imagination
and
forming
my
thoughts
and
ideas.
I
have
never
had
much
of
a
problem
in
the
usage
of
the
language.
I
often
describe
myself
as
an
inartistic
person.
This
is
the
reason
why
writing
is
important
to
me.
I
see
it
as
the
only
medium
through
which
I
can
express
any
creativity
that
I
may
have.
