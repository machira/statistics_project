I
have
been
writing
for
as
long
as
I
can
remember.
Writing
is
such
an
essential
part
of
my
life,
both
in
and
out
of
the
classroom,
that
it
is
difficult
to
exact
my
first
attempts.
To
me,
writing
is
like
swimming.
I
cannot
remember
the
first
day
I
learned
to
swim
because
it
does
not
exist.
I
did
not
learn
how
to
swim
on
one
momentous
day,
but
rather
through
years
of
hard
work,
instruction,
and
practice.
I
first
learned
the
mechanics
and
technique.
Now,
whenever
I
enter
the
pool,
it
seems
automatic
and
natural
to
merely
begin
swimming
in
a
fluid
and
precise
motion.
Similarly,
whenever
I
sit
down
to
begin
a
writing
assignment
I
utilize
all
of
my
past
instruction
and
experience
to
create
an
organized,
intricate,
and
smooth
series
of
words.
As
I
have
grown
and
matured,
so
has
my
writing.
When
I
was
a
child
in
kindergarten
and
elementary
school,
I
was
unaware
of
my
physical
or
mental
skills
and
tools.
I
was
a
small,
shy
girl
acclimating
myself
to
the
classroomOs
academic
and
social
environment.
My
disjointed
and
bare
writing
exemplified
this
naivet.
In
my
journey
from
elementary
school
to
middle
school,
I
became
more
organized
and
responsible.
Likewise
my
writing
became
clearer
and
more
focused.
My
love
for
learning
and
academic
achievement
blossomed
in
high
school,
where
I
had
my
growth
spurt
and
became
more
confident.
Although
I
have
only
completed
one
year
of
college,
I
cannot
deny
that
I
have
matured
and
become
more
of
an
adult.
My
writing
today
is
a
culmination
of
my
past
experiences,
determination,
and
love
for
learning
that
will
continue
to
improve
and
evolve
as
I
persevere
on
my
journey
of
self-discovery
and
development.
My
first
memories
of
writing
date
back
to
kindergarten.
My
teacher,
Mrs.
Webster,
taught
me
the
alphabet
and
how
to
form
the
curves
and
lines
of
every
letter.
I
learned
how
to
write
my
name
with
a
number
2
pencil
on
large-ruled
paper.
I
slowly
began
to
write
words
and
create
simple
sentences.
I
vividly
remember
how
proud
I
was
to
bring
home
dittos
and
crafts
with
my
writing
on
them.
It
seemed
unreal
that
my
writing
was
permanent.
My
parents
hung
my
creations
on
the
refrigerator,
which
only
encouraged
my
excitement.
In
elementary
school,
I
used
writing
in
almost
every
class
and
academic
scenario.
In
science
I
studied
animals,
plants,
chemicals,
and
many
other
natural
phenomena.
I
was
expected
to
not
only
understand
these
concepts
but
also
be
able
to
answer
questions
thoughtfully
and
completely.
My
writing
had
to
include
the
definitions
and
the
applications
in
real
life.
In
a
fourth
grade
composition
assignment,
I
had
to
read
a
section
of
the
textbook
and
respond
to
the
questions.
I
had
to
explain
what
fish
gills,
scales,
and
fins
were,
and
then
how
they
were
used.
I
was
also
asked
to
respond
to
a
series
questions
about
whether
animals
should
be
killed.
My
answers
to
these
questions
were
simple,
redundant,
and
choppy.
In
history
and
social
studies,
I
studied
ancient
civilizations.
In
order
to
understand
these
past
cultures
my
teachers
exposed
me
to
their
writing.
The
vast
majority
of
information
about
ancient
cultures
comes
from
their
written
stories,
laws,
business
transactions,
and
communication
with
one
another.
Writing
is
our
window
into
another
time
and
place.
I
studied
the
hieroglyphics
of
ancient
Egypt
and
the
Babylonian
Code
of
Hammurabi,
as
well
as
the
Declaration
of
Independence
and
nursery
rhymes.
I
understand
now
that
my
fascination
with
history
stems
from
its
connection
with
writing.
Writing
is
a
universal
instrument
for
communication.
It
has
allowed
people
to
trade
items,
ideas,
instruction,
and
wisdom.
In
addition,
I
used
writing
in
math
class.
Math
is
not
merely
numbers;
it
is
also
words
and
practical,
daily
scenarios.
I
needed
writing
to
connect
the
algebraic
equations
and
numeral
answers
to
the
problem.
Writing
allowed
me
to
express
the
answer
in
a
realistic
and
useful
manner.
Writing
is
the
seam
that
connects
the
patchwork
of
academics
and
life.
Without
the
written
word,
the
diverse
facets
of
life
and
learning
could
not
be
a
coherent,
integrated
whole.
In
English
class,
my
teachers
exposed
me
to
a
multitude
of
writing
assignments
and
styles.
I
wrote
book
reports,
journal
entries,
creative
pieces,
persuasive
essays,
and
more.
In
elementary
school
I
discovered
how
versatile
writing
could
be.
I
read
numerous
books
and
had
to
answer
questions
regarding
the
central
conflict
and
characteristics
of
the
main
character.
The
questions
became
more
thought
provoking
and
challenging
in
the
fifth
and
six
grade
when
I
had
to
analyze
the
characters
and
describe
their
development
throughout
the
novel.
One
of
my
favorite
books
was
Number
the
Stars
by
Lois
Lowery.
I
read
it
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
grades.
I
enjoyed
the
book
and
used
it
for
many
projects.
For
instance,
I
put
myself
in
the
protagonistOs
position
and
tried
to
imagine
whether
I
could
have
exemplified
the
bravery
and
courage
she
did
in
the
face
of
prejudice,
war,
and
danger.
In
the
sixth
grade
my
English
teacher,
Ms.
Berger,
had
the
class
create
a
portfolio
with
various
types
of
writing.
I
included
a
persuasive
essay,
declarative
essay,
short
story,
and
a
few
poems.
This
was
a
challenging
assignment
because
I
had
to
choose
from
a
few
pieces
I
had
written
earlier
in
the
year
and
include
a
few
original
pieces.
I
found
that
I
was
not
satisfied
with
some
of
my
earlier
pieces,
which
demonstrated
how
much
my
writing
had
improved
and
evolved
in
one
short
year.
I
spent
many
hours
editing,
drafting,
and
organizing.
The
final
product
included
a
table
of
contents
and
cover
page.
I
was
very
proud
of
this
project
and
my
teacher
commented
that
it
was
very
well
put
together.
I
felt
satisfied
with
my
work,
but
also
learned
how
tedious
the
editing
process
could
be.
Throughout
elementary
school
I
wrote
outside
of
classroom
as
well.
I
was
a
creative
child
who
loved
to
write
stories.
My
favorite
animal
is
the
dolphin
and
I
wrote
numerous
stories
about
dolphins
and
their
adventure.
My
family
encouraged
my
writing
and
always
eagerly
listened
to
my
mysteries
or
dolphin
escapades.
I
loved
the
attention
and
glimmer
in
my
parents
eyes
as
I
read
my
writing.
Their
pride
and
support
cultivated
my
excitement
and
interest
in
writing.
My
parents
have
always
emphasized
the
importance
of
writing.
They
believe
that
writing
is
an
essential
element
of
life.
One
must
be
able
to
write
thoughtfully,
clearly,
and
poignantly
in
order
to
communicate
in
not
only
the
literary
world,
but
also
the
business
world
and
daily
life.
The
transition
to
middle
school
included
more
schoolwork,
homework,
and
certainly
more
writing.
I
had
a
current
event
due
in
science
class
every
Friday.
I
had
to
look
through
the
newspaper
and
find
articles
that
pertained
to
topics
we
were
studying.
I
had
to
summarize
the
article
and
present
the
information
in
my
own
words.
This
was
a
challenging
endeavor
because
I
had
to
understand
and
master
the
topic
before
I
could
use
my
own
words.
Furthermore,
we
had
to
end
with
a
few
sentences
explaining
how
this
pertained
to
the
present.
Writing
helped
integrate
science
with
current
events.
In
seventh
grade
English,
one
marking
period
was
dedicated
to
the
study
of
Greek
mythology
and
the
novel
The
Odyssey.
I
found
the
history
and
elaborate
myths
captivating.
The
Odyssey
was
a
challenging
novel,
pervaded
by
decadent
landscapes,
adventure,
and
language.
For
one
assignment
I
created
chapter
to
the
novel
in
which
Odysseus
encountered
a
fictional
monster
and
was
required
to
save
his
crew
from
near
death.
My
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Delmore,
encouraged
me
and
gave
me
the
confidence
to
believe
in
myself.
She
praised
my
writing
while
always
making
suggestions
for
improvement
and
growth.
High
school
was
an
exciting
but
arduous
journey.
I
enrolled
in
all
of
the
honors
and
most
of
the
advanced
placement
courses
my
school
offered.
Writing
was
an
important
component
of
every
class.
At
the
time,
I
found
it
challenging
to
be
cognizant
of
grammar
rules
and
writing
skills,
while
writing
a
history
paper
or
biology
essay.
However,
I
understand
now
that
this
discipline
and
attention
to
detail
has
improved
my
writing.
One
cannot
choose
to
write
well
and
adhere
to
the
rules
of
grammar
only
for
English
class.
One
of
the
most
overwhelming
and
rigorous
classes
was
my
junior
history
class,
AP
US
History.
My
teacher,
Mrs.
Hornstein,
expected
college
level
work
and
was
determined
to
adequately
prepare
us
for
the
advanced
placement
test
in
May.
We
had
hours
of
homework
every
night
outlining
the
book
and
preparing
for
class
discussions.
The
advanced
placement
test
included
multiple
choice,
free
response
essays,
and
a
document
based
essay.
A
free
response
essay
is
a
routine
essay
in
which
one
is
expected
to
answer
the
question
completely
and
use
examples
to
support
a
thesis.
A
document-based
essay
is
an
essay
in
which
one
must
cite
seven
or
eight
of
the
ten
documents
to
support
a
thesis
and
answer
the
question.
I
was
assigned
countless
essays
throughout
the
year
to
prepare
for
the
test.
Mrs.
Hornstein
was
a
strict
grader
who
expected
not
only
the
answer
to
the
historic
question
but
also
an
articulate
and
thoroughly
developed
thesis.
While
I
labored
over
many
a
paper,
her
attention
to
detail
honed
my
writing
skills.
I
learned
how
to
present
my
argument
in
an
eloquent,
cohesive,
and
powerful
manner.
For
junior
and
senior
year,
my
English
teacher
was
Dr.
Jacobsohn.
Dr.
Jacobsohn
was
one
of
the
most
intelligent
men
and
engaging
teachersO
I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing.
He
took
the
time
to
get
to
know
each
of
his
students
personally.
He
knew
my
strengths
and
weaknesses
and
used
this
knowledge
to
encourage
and
challenge
me.
He
commended
my
hard
work
and
met
with
me
individually
to
discuss
my
ideas
and
various
assignments.
For
most
of
my
high
school
career,
instructions
for
writing
assignments
were
specific,
concrete,
and
one-dimensional.
However,
Dr.
Jacobsohn
let
us
be
creative
and
gave
us
the
freedom
to
decide
how
we
wanted
to
present
our
ideas.
At
first,
my
type
A
personality
found
this
teaching
style
to
be
too
unorganized
and
vague.
However
as
the
weeks
went
by
I
came
to
understand
that
Dr.
Jacobsohn
wanted
us
to
become
mature
writers.
I
learned
that
my
writing
did
not
have
to
be
confined
to
a
five-paragraph
essay;
I
had
the
independence
to
experiment
and
create
my
own
arguments.
He
recommended
that
I
read
Jane
Eyre
by
Charlotte
Bronte
for
my
junior
year
research
paper
and
Herland
and
The
Yellow
Wallpaper
by
Charlotte
Perkins
Gilman
for
my
senior
year
research
paper.
There
were
numerous
times
I
became
discouraged
with
the
papers
and
felt
I
did
not
have
a
strong
thesis.
I
was
frustrated
and
wanted
to
switch
novels.
Dr.
Jacobsohn
pushed
me
to
go
on
and
refused
to
let
me
quit.
He
did
not
give
me
the
answers,
but
rather
guided
me
and
let
me
discover
the
answer
on
my
own.
I
am
proud
of
the
papers
I
wrote
junior
and
senior
year,
however
I
also
know
that
Dr.
Jacobsohn
gave
me
the
tools
to
continue
to
grow
and
improve.
Dr
Jacobsohn
helped
me
grow
as
a
person
and
a
writer.
I
learned
to
think
outside
the
box
and
became
confident
to
support
and
develop
my
opinions.
My
writing
became
lucid,
focused,
and
expressive.
Although
I
was
nervous
and
weary
of
leaving
my
small
high
school,
I
felt
that
I
was
well
prepared
academically
for
college.
My
greatest
fear
was
losing
the
personal
relationships
with
my
teachers.
However,
Lafayette
College
exceeded
my
expectations
and
shortly
into
the
first
semester
I
felt
at
ease.
I
found
that
the
small
class
sizes
allowed
class
discussions
to
be
intimate
and
allowed
me
to
voice
questions
and
concerns
without
hesitation.
I
enjoyed
my
first
year
seminar
and
found
that
it
acclimated
me
to
college
classes
and
writing.
We
began
to
write
gradually,
by
first
summarizing
textbook
passages,
then
presenting
an
argument
using
our
textbook
for
sources,
and
finally
completing
a
research
paper.
Second
semester
in
freshman
year
I
enrolled
in
one
English
class,
Literary
Women.
The
novels
chronicled
the
brutal
that
lives
many
women
must
endure.
The
protagonists
were
confronted
with
racism,
sexism,
physical
abuse,
mental
abuse,
rape,
and
poverty.
I
enjoyed
reading
the
novels
and
participating
in
the
thoughtful
class
discussions.
For
each
novel
I
choose
a
topic
to
pursue
in
a
paper.
My
introspective
prose
explored
the
many
dimensions,
influences,
and
constraints
of
the
colorful
characters.
I
received
encouraging
comments
from
my
professor,
which
challenged
me
to
take
risks
and
to
undertake
meaningful
projects.
My
first
year
of
college
has
inspired
me
to
set
lofty
goals
to
realize
my
dreams
and
potential.
I
have
found
that
writing
is
an
essential
part
of
my
education
and
life.
Writing
is
a
skill
that
can
help
me
express
my
thoughts
and
ideas.
My
past
experiences
have
cultivated
my
skills.
Moreover,
the
past
has
shown
me
that
progress
and
growth
are
fostered
by
hard
work
and
determination.
I
strive
to
learn
from
every
new
experience
in
order
to
become
a
better
writer,
student,
and
person.
