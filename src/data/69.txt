My
Literacy
Narrative
L.
A
New
Writing
Associate
August
16,
1996
My
earliest
memory
of
completing
a
writing
assignment
is
from
my
early
years
in
elementary
school.
In
fifth
grade,
I
wrote
an
exciting
story
about
a
cat
named
Morris.
Morris
possessed
magical
powers
and
had
the
ability
to
fly.
He
traveled
all
over
the
country
and
visited
numerous
national
attractions,
such
as
the
Grand
Canyon.
Although
he
was
famous
for
his
flying
talent,
he
was
known
more
for
his
heroic
deeds.
I
wrote
this
short,
two
page
story
incorporating
details
developed
from
numerous
hours
of
daydreaming.
When
I
was
younger,
I
often
made
up
stories
where
people
could
do
anything.
I
always
thought
flying
would
be
the
ultimate
ability
to
have
and
my
characters
often
found
themselves
hurtling
through
the
air
at
extremely
high
velocities
or
flying
gracefully
above
hordes
of
jealous,
yet
appreciative,
onlookers.
My
story
was
selected
to
be
included
in
an
annual
publication,
by
my
elementary
school,
comprised
of
creative
tales,
poetry
and
stories
about
real
people
and
events.
I
remember
reading
my
exciting
tale
to
my
friends
and
family,
who
loved
the
idea
of
a
flying,
heroic
cat.
Of
course,
since
I
was
a
little
girl
who
dreamed
often
and
loved
fairy
tales,
I
concluded
my
story
about
Morris
by...
marrying
him
off
to
an
equally
heroic
and
flying
Female
cat.
I
guess
even
when
I
was
younger,
I
liked
my
writing
to
be
different
and
reflect
some
of
my
beliefs.
Elementary
school
was
definitely
a
time
when
my
creative
writing
interest
was
piqued.
Every
week
in
sixth
grade,
my
class
was
given
a
vocabulary
list.
During
the
week,
we
were
required
to
complete
various
exercises
using
all
the
words.
There
were
different
options,
but
I
always
chose
to
write
a
story
utilizing
every
word.
The
stories
were
only
a
paragraph
long,
but
I
managed
to
stretch
my
imagination
and
make
each
word
fit,
despite
the
weird
or
unusual
outcome.
Usually,
my
teacher
would
pick
my
story,
among
others,
to
read
aloud
because
the
tale
was
either
comical
or
downright
strange.
I
enjoyed
writing
creatively
and
I
loved
to
make
my
peers
laugh.
Besides
creative
writing,
I
was
also
required
to
complete
a
number
of
research''
reports
on
books,
authors
and
countries.
Although
these
research"
reports
usually
varied
in
length
from
six
to
fifteen
pages,
elementary
school
was
the
era
of
the
pen
-
not
the
computer.
As
a
result,
I
tended
to
regard
these
papers
as
extremely
time
consuming
because
of
the
concentration
required
to
write-
without
errors-
the
final
copy.
The
most
interesting
report
I
completed
was
on
every
sixth
grade
student's
favorite
country...Yugoslavia.
I
was
lucky
enough
to
draw
the
last
number
in
the
Country
Lottery
and
Yugoslavia
was
the
only
country
remaining.
The
report
required
an
oral
presentation
on
various
aspects
of
the
country,
a
ten
page
written
report,
a
poster,
dressing
in
holiday
apparel
and
producing
a
travel
brochure.
Creating
and
writing
the
brochure
interested
me
because
it
was
my
first
exposure
to
persuasive
writing.
In
sixth
grade,
the
goal
of
persuasive
writing
was
to
convince
the
reader
to
agree
with
the
writer,
using
all
available
means.
Since
Yugoslavia
was
not
a
well
known
location,
I
had
an
extremely
hard
task
at
hand.
I
had
to
convince
my
elementary
school,
cartoon-addicted
playmates
that
some
day,
they
should
and
needed
to
visit
Yugoslavia.
Needless
to
say,
I
appealed
to
virtually
every
chill's
love
of
the
outdoors
and
raved
about
the
beautiful
country
and
majestic
landscape.
In
addition,
I
included
pictures
of
interesting
things
and
explained
them.
In
other
words,
I
showed
pictures
of
people
in
native
costumes
and
explained
why
they
were
not
wearing
jeans-
the
staple
of
virtually
every
eleven
year
old
American's
wardrobe.
Junior
high
school
exposed
me
to
entirely
new
areas
of
writing.
For
instance,
I
was
introduced
to
the
often
challenging
world
of
grammar.
Although
I
tried
my
best,
grammar
remained
an
elusive
tool
that
seemed
to
be
in
my
grasp
at
one
instant
and
slip
through
my
fingers
in
the
next
instant.
Luckily
for
me,
an
overlooked
contestant
for
the
Grammar
Queen
race,
junior
high,
especially
eighth
grade,
also
brought
forth
novels
of
all
types
and
reaction
and
interpretive
essays
concerning
the
readings.
My
eighth
grade
English
teacher
was
one
of
the
weirdest
teachers
I
have
ever
encountered.
My
writing
experience,
in
her
class,
can
only
be
described
as
strange
but
rewarding.
Under
her
direction,
I
read
numerous
books,
such
as
The
Adventures
of
Tom
Sawyer
and
The
Diary
of
Anne
Frank,
which
covered
a
broad
range
of
topics.
Sometimes
she
would
give
the
class
a
specific
essay
question
to
answer,
but
she
was
usually
more
inclined
to
require
us
to
react"
on
an
individual
level
to
the
assigned
readings.
There
were
numerous
options;
I
could
write
an
essay,
a
poem,
a
short
story
or
a
short
script
based
on
what
I
felt
I
had
gained
from
the
assigned
reading.
I
enjoyed
writing
reaction
papers
in
this
class
because
I
could
basically
choose
my
own
purpose
for
my
paper.
Although
it
was
sometimes
difficult
to
begin,
since
a
clear
destination
was
not
given,
I
believe
that
I
learned
to
think
more
independently.
More
importantly,
I
was
able
to
discover
that
everyone
reacts
differently
to
a
single
piece
of
writing.
Since
a
right
or
wrong
answer
did
not
exist,
each
member
of
the
class
was
free
to
expand
on
whatever
particular
part,
person
or
event
in
the
story
had
captured
their
attention.
Often,
the
teacher
would
choose
a
few
papers
to
read
to
the
class
and
mine
was
usually
among
them.
It
was
extremely
interesting
to
hear
how
the
different
opinions
of
various
individuals
were
expressed.
As
a
result
of
the
encouragement
given
to
me
to
think
independently
and
the
positive
feedback
returned,
I
became
more
confident
in
my
ability
to
write
without
formal
guidelines.
Upon
entering
high
school,
I
was
immediately
challenged
to
upgrade
the
quality
of
my
writing.
In
tenth
and
eleventh
grade,
I
was
required
to
write
essays
on
novels
that
were
much
harder
to
understand
and
even
more
difficult
to
write
about.
Although
I
was
a
little
intimidated
in
the
beginning,
I
soon
learned
that
a
successful
essay
just
required
more
concentration
and
more
time
to
write.
Fortunately,
during
this
time
of
self-adjustment,
I
had
an
excellent
English
teacher
who
taught
with
an
incredible
amount
of
energy
and
humor.
She
was
able
to
make
even
the
most
mundane
writing
assignment
seem
interesting,
in
addition,
she
made
the
readings
come
alive.
Instead
of
dissecting
the
stories
and
characters
for
the
class,
she
asked
questions
which
made
us
think
and
gave
encouragement
or
a
small
hint
when
the
class
was
stumped
for
the
answer.
Under
her
instruction,
I
was
able
to
further
my
creative
writing
talents
and
formal
essay
writing
techniques.
In
addition,
her
constructive
criticism
was
usually
favorable
and
she
liked
the
way
I
responded
to
essay
questions.
As
a
result,
I
gained
more
confidence
in
my
ability
to
produce
writing
worthy
of
praise.
Little
did
I
know
that
my
confidence
was
about
to
be
tested
by
a
class
named
simply
AP
English".
After
having
survived
the
course,
I
can
think
of
a
few
necessary
subtitles,
such
as
''Blood,
Sweat,
Tears
and
an
unbreakable
bond
with
your
computer-
guaranteed".
AP
English
was
taught
by
a
military
drill
sergeant
with
a
double
masters
in
English
and
Criticism.
In
addition,
the
teacher
was
disguised
as
a
petite,
frail
looking
older
woman.
Even
her
name-
Mrs.
Welcome''-
was
misleading,
for
only
those
students
willing
to
give
a
120%
were
truly
welcome.
The
assignments
for
her
class
included
a
three
to
four
page
paper
a
week
and
a
surprise
essay
quiz
approximately
every
other
week.
In
addition,
each
student
was
entitled
to
as
many
scathing
remarks
and
written
comments
needed
to
finally
produce
quality
writing,
which
had
to
meet
her
extremely
high
standards.
Although
it
may
sound
strange,
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
on
the
receiving
end
of
her
out
lash
more
than
once.
For
even
though
she
was
extremely
demanding
and
critical,
she
was
also
an
excellent
teacher
and
her
ultimate
goal
was
to
help
her
students
become
better
writers.
Mrs.
Welcome
was
one
of
the
first
teachers
I
encountered
who
was
not
satisfied
with
my
essays.
For
the
first
time,
my
grades
were
low
and
my
confidence
was
shaky.
Fortunately,
I
was
determined
to
prove
my
worth
and
continued
my
efforts
to
produce
quality
writing.
Although
I
honestly
tried
to
remain
upbeat
and
hold
on
to
the
fading
dream
that
I
would
some
day
please
my
English
teacher,
it
was
not
always
easy.
Often,
my
essays
were
returned
looking
as
if
her
red
pen
had
exploded
on
every
page.
Her
comments
ranged
from
mere
remarks
on
punctuation
and
grammar,
to
questions
such
as,
Did
you
read
the
same
book
I
did?".
Since
I
had
never
been
exposed
to
continuous
harsh
criticism
before,
writing
essays
in
AP
English
was
intimidating
at
first.
However,
once
I
began
to
use
her
comments
to
write
my
revisions
and
future
first
drafts,
my
grades
started
to
increase.
In
addition,
I
learned
to
view
her
comments
for
what
they
really
were-
constructive
criticism.
I
realized
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
write
a
perfect
essay
every
time.
In
addition,
I
learned
that
revision
is
a
necessary
part
of
a
successful
writing
process.
AP
English
also
exposed
me
to
the
types
of
writing
assignments
I
would
encounter
in
college.
During
my
senior
year,
I
wrote
a
number
of
essays
on
novels,
short
stories
and
poetry.
For
the
first
time,
I
had
to
write
a
thesis
before
beginning
the
essay.
The
thesis
was
supposed
to
be
the
central
idea
which
I
would
focus
on
and
support
throughout
the
paper.
I
learned
that
if
something
in
the
essay
was
irrelevant
to
my
thesis,
then
it
should
be
eliminated
or
revised
till
it
was
clearly
connected.
Personally,
I
believe
that
this
simple
point
was
probably
the
most
important
thing
I
learned
in
any
English
class.
Although
I
found
myself
spending
long
hours
at
the
computer
trying
to
produce
cohesive
essays,
the
hours
were
beneficial
because
they
facilitated
my
transition
to
writing
college
essays.
An
additional
important
experience,
that
I
was
given
through
AP
English,
was
writing
a
research
paper
completely
on
my
own.
In
other
words,
there
was
no
initial
question
to
answer
or
topics
from
which
to
choose.
Instead,
I
had
to
pick
any
two
pieces
of
literature
that
I
had
read
and
somehow
connect
them
through
a
strong
thesis
and
a
supporting
eight
to
ten
page
paper.
Although
the
assignment
was
challenging,
it
was
also
extremely
interesting.
Mrs.
Welcome
taught
the
class
how
to
properly
organize
a
research
paper
by
developing
an
outline,
finding
published
critical
responses
to
the
two
pieces
of
literature
chosen,
how
to
use
index
cards
for
quotations
and
organizing
ideas,
and
how
to
avoid
plagiarism
through
correct
citation
of
information.
I
honestly
did
enjoy
writing
the
paper,
once
I
had
decided
on
my
thesis.
The
two
novels
I
chose
were
Franz
Kafka's
The
Metamorphosis
and
Robert
Cormier's
Beyond
the
Chocolate
War.
In
my
paper,
I
argued
that
societal
pressures
and
personal
insecurities
adversely
influenced
the
protagonists
actions
and
decisions.
The
research
paper
was
also
the
final
exam,
and
I
devoted
all
my
free
time
to
writing
the
best
essay
possible.
Although
it
took
my
entire
senior
year
to
learn
and
revise
my
writing
techniques,
I
finally
accomplished
my
goal
set
earlier
in
the
year-1
produced
a
paper
worthy
of
the
sergeant's
praise.
When
I
received
my
graded
paper
and
saw
a
big,
red
A
,
I
decided
that
red
was
definitely
more
agreeable
in
smaller
quantities.
The
moment
that
I
saw
my
grade
was
one
of
the
proudest
moments
of
my
writing
career.
Not
only
had
I
learned
to
become
a
better
writer,
but
achieving
success
after
all
my
previous
failures,
led
me
to
acquire
permanent
confidence
in
my
ability
to
produce
essays
of
high
quality.
My
freshman
year
at
Lafayette
brought
forth
different
classes
and
professors,
which,
in
turn,
resulted
in
completely
different
responses
to
my
writing.
My
first
year
seminar
was
one
of
my
worst
writing
and
class
experiences.
Although
the
material
was
interesting,
the
professor
was
not.
In
addition,
over
the
course
of
a
semester,
I
failed
to
acquire
even
a
minute
understanding
of
what
it
was
that
he
wanted
in
an
essay
to
receive
a
favorable
grade.
Even
though
the
class
was
assigned
a
good
WA,
whose
writing
abilities
I
never
questioned,
even
she
did
not
understand
his
motivation
for
grading.
Although
I
felt
that
I
was
adequately
prepared
for
college
writing,
the
lack
of
communication
between
the
professor
and
the
class,
concerning
what
was
considered
a
successful
essay,
was
extremely
frustrating.
For
the
first
in
my
life,
I
regarded
writing
as
an
unpleasant,
unavoidable
chore.
I
still
put
forth
an
honest
effort
to
write
quality
essays,
but
I
found
that
I
felt
defeated,
even
before
I
began.
Fortunately,
my
FYS
was
only
one
of
five
classes
that
I
was
taking.
In
all
of
my
other
classes,
I
was
receiving
favorable
responses
to
my
writing,
which
provided
much
needed
support
for
my
wilting
confidence.
Two
courses
that
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
and
excelled
in
during
my
freshman
year
were
my
First
Year
Writing
course
and
Introduction
to
Political
Theory.
Although
both
professors
were
extremely
different,
I
learned
a
tremendous
amount
about
writing
from
both
of
them.
My
FYW
professor
was
an
excellent
teacher.
She
challenged
the
class
with
various
assignments
which
were
meant
to
elicit
different
types
of
ideas
and
written
responses.
Although
she
had
read
the
assigned
novels
many
more
times
then
her
students,
she
was
always
willing
to
consider
new
viewpoints.
In
addition,
she
encouraged
students
to
regard
pieces
of
writing
from
different
angles.
One
of
my
most
memorable
experiences
in
her
class
came
after
I
made
a
controversial
statement
about
the
nature
of
one
of
the
female
characters
feelings
for
Ethan,
during
a
discussion
of
the
novel
Ethan
Frome
.
Even
though
my
professor
admitted
she
had
never
thought
about
the
relationship
from
my
particular
point
of
view,
she
encouraged
me
to
support
my
statement.
After
I
had
substantiated
my
point,
she
suggested
that
I
develop
my
idea
more
and
use
it
as
the
focus
of
the
essay
required
in
response
to
the
reading.
As
a
result
of
her
interest
in
my
particular
ideas
and
her
favorable
response
to
my
essay,
I
became
intrigued
with
the
varying
angles
from
which
a
piece
of
writing
could
be
analyzed.
Furthermore,
I
found
that
I
enjoyed
writing
essays
from
unfamiliar
or
unpopular
viewpoints
because
trying
to
find
evidence
to
support
my
assertions
was
more
challenging
and
interesting.
Fortunately,
my
new
found
love
of
the
underdog
view
was
also
successful
in
my
government
class,
Introduction
to
Political
Theory.
In
this
class,
I
learned
to
write
a
persuasive
essay
that
was
two-thirds
analytical
and
one-third
individual
response.
The
paper
topics
were
actually
short
questions
meant
to
be
the
impetus
for
independent
thinking.
Moreover,
the
development
of
a
thesis
rested
solely
on
the
individual.
Also,
the
professor
demanded
papers
that
were
cohesive
with
an
emphasis
on
thesis
development.
In
addition,
he
also
told
the
class
to
include
our
own
personal
views,
connecting
our
thesis
to
the
modem
world
and
literature.
Many
of
the
ideas
used
to
the
write
the
papers
were
developed
in
class
during
discussions
of
the
reading.
Opinions
which
were
contrary
to
the
professor's
were
encouraged,
but
they
needed
to
be
immediately
substantiated
by
reference
to
quotations
made
within
the
literature.
If
a
student
could
not
support
a
statement
about
the
novel,
with
a
direct
quotation
from
the
novel,
then
the
point
was
mute.
Through
the
professors
incessant
demands
for
substantiation
of
ideas,
during
class
and
in
comments
on
papers,
I
learned
how
to
develop
a
thesis,
give
support
through
references
to
the
literature
and
openly
acknowledge
doubts
that
the
reader
or
myself
may
have
considering
the
idea.
This
was
the
first
time
I
been
told
to
include
doubts
or
questions
I
had
about
my
own
thesis,
and
also
to
speak
in
the
first
person
during
the
individual
response
portion
of
the
paper.
Through
the
numerous
class
discussions
and
the
written
comments
on
papers,
I
was
able
to
improve
my
ability
to
argue
a
point
and
defend
my
thesis,
while
still
admitting
that
I,
as
the
writer,
am
not
omniscient.
Overall,
I
believe
that
most
of
the
improvement
and
development
of
my
current
writing
style
and
ability
occurred
in
the
last
three
years.
I
am
extremely
grateful
to
my
AP
English
teacher
who
ensured
that
I
was
more
than
adequately
prepared
for
college
writing.
In
addition,
I
think
that
the
mix
of
professors,
that
I
was
exposed
to
in
my
first
two
years
at
Lafayette,
was
beneficial
because
I
learned
to
produce
different
types
of
papers
for
varying
classes.
Moreover,
I
feel
that
the
favorable
responses
that
I
have
received
to
my
writing
have
helped
to
strengthen
my
confidence,
while
the
constructive
criticism
I
have
received
has
improved
the
quality
of
my
writing.
I
believe
the
most
important
thing
that
I
have
learned
over
the
years,
in
terms
of
paper
writing,
is
that
it
is
acceptable
for
me
to
see
different
viewpoints,
but
it
is
more
important
to
be
able
substantiate
my
claims
and
make
the
audience
understand,
if
not
agree
with,
my
outlook.
