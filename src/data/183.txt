"A
Strange
Revelation
Concerning
the
Writing
Process
"
For
the
better
part
of
my
academic
career,
I
have
always
thought
that
as
my
writing
skills
improved,
the
actual
task
of
writing
would
become
easier.
And,
to
me,
"easier"
meant
that
it
would
take
less
time
to
produce
an
acceptable,
or
even
excellent,
paper.
Following
this
logic,
by
the
time
I
was
a
college
senior,
complete
with
all
the
writing
skills
that
Lafayette
has
to
offer,
I
would
be
able
to
produce
a
quality
paper
in
no
time
at
all.
My
experiences
as
a
writing
associate
over
the
past
year,
however,
have
helped
me
to
appreciate
that
this
theory
is
not
true
at
all.
In
fact,
I
have
come
to
understand
that
as
one's
writing
skills
improve,
the
actual
task
of
writing
a
quality
paper
becomes
more
difficult.
As
a
writer
acquires
or
masters
each
new
skill,
such
as
grammar,
structure
or
thesis,
he
or
she
is
forced
to
apply
and
re-apply
these
skills
to
a
draft,
in
order
to
produce
the
best
possible
paper.
In
a
way,
each
new
skill
becomes
a
tool
for
that
writer
to
use
on
the
next
paper;
like
most
tools,
each
skill
takes
time
to
apply
and
re-apply,
in
order
to
get
the
maximum
benefit.
Thus,
as
one's
writing
skills
improve,
writing
indeed
approaches
that
famous
(or
infamous)
process
called
the
"continual
process
of
writing,"
as
skills
are
applied,
re-applied,
polished
and
re-polished.
And,
as
a
writer
approached
this
state
of
"nirvana"
in
writing,
it
definitely
takes
more
time
to
produce
a
quality
paper.
This
notion
still
remains
somewhat
counter-intuitive
to
me,
but
I
have
been
able
to
appreciate
and
understand
it
through
several
experiences
and
thoughts
I
have
received
as
a
result
of
my
position
as
a
writing
associate.
First,
I
should
say
why
my
position
as
a
writing
associate
has
been
so
crucial
in
my
understanding
of
this
concept
of
writing
as
a
continual
process.
There
is
a
familiar
phrase
that
W.A.'s
hear:
"W.A.s
need
W.A.s".
This
phrase
alludes
to
the
fact
that
a
writing
associate
is
also
a
writer
him
or
herself,
and
thus
still
encounters
the
same
problems
that
every
other
writer
faces.
One
of
the
major
problems
that
every
writer
faces
is
that
he
or
she
is
often
so
involved
with
the
paper,
that
it
is
often
difficult
to
objectively
analyze
a
draft
or
the
actual
writing
process.
Having
worked
with
the
paper
from
the
very
beginning,
writers
often
cannot
detach
themselves
enough
to
"take
a
step
back."
Well,
a
writing
associate
is
no
different.
I
often
have
difficulty
in
analyzing
my
own
drafts,
and
I
almost
always
have
difficulty
in
analyzing
my
writing
process.
Thus,
I
could
not
see
that
as
my
writing
skills
improved,
so
too
did
the
time
it
took
to
complete
an
acceptable
draft.
Subjective
questions,
such
as
"is
this
the
best
I
can
do?"
or
"How
much
does
this
writing
style
really
work
in
this
area
of
the
paper,"
clouded
my
observations
on
my
writing
decisions
and
processes.
The
phrase
"W.A.
s
need
W.A.s"
rang
especially
true
for
me
several
times
in
my
recent
writing
career
as
a
W.A.
Yet,
I
found
that
the
same
personal
questions
and
over-attachment
did
not
always
cloud
my
observations
of
other
people's
drafts.
And
as
a
W.A.,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
observe
a
lot
of
other
people's
drafts
(sometimes
too
many).
I
often
met
with
people
several
times
over
the
course
of
the
semester,
and
I
had
to
opportunity
to
observe
the
growth
of
their
writing
skills.
More
importantly,
I
often
followed
the
evolution
of
a
particular
person's
writing
process.
And
because
I
was
detached
from
the
actual
draft
and
the
topic,
and
because
I
met
with
these
same
writers
at
somewhat
regular
intervals,
it
was
almost
as
if
I
was
watching
time-lapse
photography
of
a
paper
evolving
into
a
final
draft.
I
could
see
the
changes
in
a
person's
drafts
and
writing
process
in
leaps
and
bounds,
and
could
observe
in
detail
where
a
writer
has
changed
an
aspect
of
their
paper.
Once
again,
as
a
writer,
I
would
be
too
attached
to
the
paper
to
notice
any
slow,
gradual
changes
in
my
own
writing
process.
Yet
as
a
W.A.,
I
could
observe
changes
in
other
people's
writing
styles
much
more
clearly.
In
short,
my
position
as
a
writing
associate
was
like
a
microscope
that
allowed
me
to
study
the
evolution
of
the
writing
process,
and
to
appreciate
the
concept
that
becoming
a
more
experienced
writer
actually
meant
that
writing
would
often
become
a
more
difficult,
and
time-consuming
experience.
With
this
in
mind,
several
experiences
in
particular
have
taught
me
about
the
writing
process.
One
of
the
most
basic
experiences
is
one
of
my
most
common
experiences.
When
teachers
create
syllabi,
the
often
use
the
term
deadline
to
express
the
date
on
which
a
paper
is
due.
Even
if
the
teacher
uses
the
term
due-date,
the
student
often
substitute
the
term
deadline
in
their
minds.
In
many
of
my
conferences
this
notion
hangs
over
the
students
like
an
anvil.
Many
students
are
concerned
with
finishing
the
paper
by
the
deadline,
and
only
think
about
how
much
revision
they
can
fit
in
before
the
deadline.
(I
realize
that
I
am
over-using
the
term
"deadline",
but
this
is
nothing
compared
to
how
often
I
hear
the
term
in
my
conferences)
Personally
speaking,
I
can
think
of
no
other
term
that
contradicts
everything
that
students
are
supposed
to
learn
about
the
writing
process.
We
are
taught
that
papers
should
be
drafted,
re-drafted,
and
then
drafted
again.
Like
I
have
said
above,
writing
should
be
a
process,
and
a
living,
evolving
entity.
Why,
then,
is
the
paper
going
to
be
given
a
"dead"line?
This
term
does
not
encourage
students
to
revise
a
living
entity
that
they
know
must
be
finished,
or
"dead,"
on
a
certain
date.
I
do
not
know
what
term
we
should
start
using,
or
what
alternative
system
could
be
used
to
collect
paper,
but
I
simply
ask
that
we
get
away
from
the
use
of
this
term,
"deadline".
Yet
the
concept
of
a
deadline,
or
a
due
date,
has
been
helpful
to
me
in
illustrating
what
I
have
come
to
understand:
as
a
writer's
ability
grows,
so
too
does
the
time
it
takes
to
create
a
quality
paper.
This
idea
becomes
most
clear
during
a
conference,
when
the
W.
A.
explains
what
areas
of
the
paper
need
the
most
work
before
the
deadline
of
the
paper.
The
writer
invariably
rolls
his
or
her
eyes
and
lets
out
a
low
groan,
knowing
that
more
work
still
needs
to
be
done.
And
more
work
means
more
time.
Yet,
in
learning
where
their
paper
needs
improvement,
and
in
working
with
the
W.
A.
to
learn
how
to
improve
those
areas,
the
writer
is
actually
increasing
their
skills
as
a
writer,
however
minutely.
At
times
like
this,
the
writer
is
demonstrating
that
when
a
writer
improves
his
or
her
skills,
it
often
takes
more
time
to
create
an
acceptable
paper.
Although
the
writer
will
(hopefully)
improve
his
or
her
writing
skills
as
a
result
of
a
conference,
the
writer
will
also
need
to
spend
more
time
on
his
or
her
subsequent
papers
in
order
to
produce
an
acceptable
paper.
I
have
also
learned
about
the
writing
process
through
another
experience
that
is
common
to
most
writing
associates.
During
a
set
of
conferences
for
a
paper,
writers
will
bring
in
drafts
that
range
from
the
fully
revised
and
highly
polished
"final"
drafts,
to
the
hastily
written,
highly
illegible
half
page
outlines
that
were
obviously
composed
on
the
walk
over
to
the
conference.
Granted,
there
is
an
obvious
difference
in
the
amount
of
effort
and
time
put
into
these
drafts
on
opposite
end
of
the
writing
process
spectrum.
Yet,
as
a
writing
associate
for
this
set
of
papers
who
has
the
opportunity
to
read
all
of
the
papers
that
fall
in
between
these
two
polar
opposites,
I
can
see
how
the
fully
revised
and
highly
polished
paper
got
its
start
in
the
highly
illegible
outline
composed
on
the
walk
to
the
conference.
And
conversely,
I
can
see
how
the
outline
has
the
ability
and
the
potential
to
grow
into
that
same
highly
polished
"final"
draft.
In
effect,
the
same
ability
and
potential
is
present
in
the
earliest
and
latest
stages
of
the
same
paper
topic;
and
I
can
simply
witness
the
continuum
of
the
writing
process
in
a
very
short
amount
of
time.
Over
the
three
of
four
days
that
it
takes
to
meet
with
all
of
the
students
in
my
course,
I
get
to
see
all
of
the
various
stages
of
the
same
paper.
As
a
result,
I
can
witness
the
growth
of
a
paper
from
that
very,
very
rough
outline
into
the
"final"
draft,
in
a
very
compact
amount
of
time.
Speaking
for
selfish
reasons,
this
is
an
incredible
opportunity.
I
can
analyze
just
how
the
paper
evolves
from
one
end
to
the
other.
Invariably,
all
of
these
papers
are
just
a
short
distance
from
the
papers
on
either
side
of
the
writing
continuum.
It
is
a
wonderful
example
of
the
progress
that
should
take
place
during
the
continual
process
of
writing.
While
all
of
the
papers
are
not
the
same
exact
topics,
they
serve
as
excellent
examples
of
the
various
stages
of
the
writing
process.
As
a
writer
myself,
I
can
try
to
emulate
these
various
stages
in
my
writing
process.
And
with
all
of
these
examples
to
learn
from,
and
after
studying
how
to
get
from
one
stage
to
another,
I
find
it
easier
to
follow
my
own
process
of
writing.
I
can
move
from
a
rough
outline,
to
that
first
rough
draft,
to
a
more
refined
paper
and
finally,
to
that
acceptable,
or
even
acceptable,
paper.
I
have
observed
so
many
examples
of
each
stage
of
writing,
that
I
find
myself
in
familiar
ground
throughout
the
evolution
of
my
paper,
which
gives
me
the
confidence
and
ability
to
create
a
quality
paper.
These
experiences
throughout
my
first
year
as
a
writing
associate
have
helped
me
in
my
own
writing.
As
I
have
learned
a
certain
sense
of
detachment
from
the
papers
of
the
writers
that
I
meet
with,
I
have
also
learned
to
detach
myself
somewhat
from
my
own
papers.
From
analyzing
and
studying
the
papers
of
others,
I
have
learned
how
to
analyze
and
study
my
own
papers.
This
new
skill
alone
had
made
my
experience
as
a
writing
associate
worthwhile.
While
I
still
believe
in
the
phrase
that
"W.A.'s
need
W.A.'s,"
I
also
believe
that
I
have
gained
a
sort
of
writer's
independence,
that
allows
me
to
objectively
analyze
my
own
drafts.
.1
have
also
learned
that
writing
should
indeed
be
a
continual,
evolving
progress,
and
that
the
term
"deadline"
is
not
conducive
to
such
a
perception
of
writing.
I
have
witnessed
how
writers
instinctively
realize
that
becoming
a
better
writer
means
spending
more,
not
less,
time
on
a
paper.
And
lastly,
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
witness
simultaneously
the
various
stages
of
a
paper
in
its
evolution.
Such
an
opportunity
has
allowed
me
to
follow
the
same
stages
with
more
familiarity
and
confidence.
All
of
these
experiences
and
lessons
have
impacted
my
own
writing
in
dramatic
ways.
