Writing
Like
a
WA
11
August
1998
Project
for
Workshop
At
one
of
my
last
WA
meetings
during
the
fall
semester
of
this
past
year,
I
remember
a
discussion
about
papers
we
had
written
over
the
course
of
the
semester.
Each
one
of
us
was
asked
to
describe
a
specific
example
for
the
topic
we
were
discussing.
When
it
was
my
turn
to
tell
about
the
relevant
assignment
1
had
written,
1
was
embarrassed
to
have
to
admit
that
I
did
not
have
one
writing
assignment
all
semester.
As
a
Behavioral
Neuroscience
major,
taking
courses
such
as
organic
chemistry
and
genetics,
I
didn't
write
a
single
paper,
essay,
or
even
paragraph.
That
same
semester
was
also
my
first
as
Writing
Associate,
however,
and
although
I
didn't
actually
have
the
opportunity
to
write
very
often,
I
received
that
creative
stimulation
I
love
so
much
by
reading
papers
instead
of
writing
them.
From
my
first
writing
associate
conference,
I
knew
I
would
love
being
a
WA.
As
I
sat
with
my
first
student,
1
was
rushed
back
to
my
first
semester
as
a
freshman,
sitting
timidly
with
my
WA,
having
virtually
no
idea
what
to
think
or
say
about
my
paper
to
this
older,
smarter
student.
Remembering
this
helped
me
through
my
first
conference
on
the
other
side.
I
read
through
most
of
that
first
paper
with
the
student,
asking
questions,
giving
compliments,
sharing
my
thoughts,
and
most
of
all,
listening.
1
distinctly
remembered
how
my
WA
had
listened
to
me,
asked
me
what
my
concerns
were,
and
made
me
feel
comfortable
about
my
writing.
I
applied
all
these
memories
to
my
first
conference
and
when
those
first
30
minutes
flew
by
in
what
seemed
to
be
five,
I
knew
that
the
student
felt
much
more
confident
about
her
paper.
She
realized
that
she
had
a
lot
of
revising
to
do,
but
told
me,
as
she
left,
that
she
"felt
so
much
better."
After
an
entire
day
of
fulfilling
conferences
and
making
others
feel
confident,
I
realized
that
i
also
felt
better
about
myself
as
a
writer.
Somehow
1
knew
that
I
had
done
well
on
my
first
day
as
a
WA
and
this
knowledge
made
me
think
that
if
I
was
able
to
help
others
write
papers,
I
was
probably
an
'ok'
writer
myself.
My
first
round
of
conferences
went
flawlessly.
Every
student
appeared
on
time
with
a
full
draft,
questions,
and
ideas.
I
got
along
well
with
most
of
them,
making
time
to
engage
in
small
talk
about
Lafayette
and
their
first
few
weeks
of
college.
I
think
I
really
connected
with
a
few
of
them,
as
I
often
found
myself
staying
longer
than
the
allotted
30
minutes
just
to
chat
with
a
student.
I
was
able
to
confer
with
my
class's
professor
on
a
very
professional
level,
sharing
my
thoughts
on
their
papers
and
ideas
with
her.
I
felt
successful
at
the
end
of
the
first
set
of
meetings.
I
wish
all
four
sets
had
gone
as
well.
After
what
I
guess
was
the
students'
uncertainty
as
to
how
strict
I
was
going
to
be,
many
of
them
began
to
come
to
our
meetings
unprepared,
late,
or
not
at
all.
Although
1
tried
to
be
understanding
and
accommodating
in
rescheduling,
it
was
often
difficult
to
meet
with
all
the
students
due
to
my
own
busy
academic
schedule.
For
those
who
seemed
to
have
legitimate
excuses,
I
was
forgiving.
However,
a
few
students
who
didn't
show
for
meetings
made
no
attempt
to
return
my
phone
calls
or
mailbox
notes.
There
was
little
1
could
do
in
such
situations.
I
learned
how
to
deal
with
students
who
came
unprepared,
however.
I
simply
told
them
that
I
understood
that
they
didn't
have
time,
etc.
etc.
but
that
I
was
more
than
willing
to
help
them
start
a
paper
in
the
meeting
by
brainstorming
and
outlining.
I
made
sure
to
go
over
the
assignment
with
them,
discuss
the
professor's
expectations,
and
begin
to
write
down
ideas
and
possibilities.
I
was
usually
able
to
make
even
unprepared
students
leave
with
somewhat
of
a
start
to
their
papers.
Although
some
of
the
students
made
my
job
as
a
WA
somewhat
difficult,
the
experience
was
overall
very
worthwhile.
I
was
so
pleased
to
note
the
difference
in
the
writing
of
many
of
the
students
from
their
first
papers
to
their
last.
I
was
also
happy
to
see
that
many
of
them
had
actually
enjoyed
their
FYS
and
seemed
to
be
adjusting
well
to
Lafayette.
The
most
inspirational
times
I
experienced
as
a
Writing
Associate
were
during
three
of
the
last
conferences
I
had,
when
three
students
expressed
their
interest
in
becoming
WAs.
I
felt
that
I
must
have
had
some
positive
impact
on
their
writing
experiences
and
adjustment
to
Lafayette
for
them
to
want
to
be
WAs.
After
telling
them
how
to
get
involved
in
the
College
Writing
Program,
I
was
delighted
to
learn
that
two
of
my
students
will
be
Writing
Associates
this
upcoming
semester.
Although
I
was
only
a
WA
for
the
first
semester
of
last
year,
I
had
many
of
my
own
papers
to
revise
during
the
second
semester
of
my
sophomore
year.
As
1
wrote
numerous
lab
reports
for
my
lab
courses
and
papers
for
my
VAST
course,
I
found
myself
calling
upon
many
of
the
methods
I
had
used
during
my
conferences
with
my
first
year
students.
I
often
consulted
the
St.
Marten's
handbook,
as
I
had
instructed
them
to
do
so
often,
and
also
brainstormed
and
listed
ideas
when
1
had
writer's
block,
as
I
had
also
instructed
them
to
do.
When
I
finished
a
paper,
I
noticed
that
I
re-read
it
and
revised
it
in
a
different
way
than
I
had
in
the
past:
I
had
learned
to
peruse
my
own
papers
in
a
completely
objective
manner,
by
not
expecting
anything
specific
and
by
being
critical
but
constructive
in
my
editing.
As
a
second
semester
sophomore,
I
was
required
to
take
a
VAST
course
and
was
lucky
enough
to
have
been
assigned
to
my
first
choice,
Literature
and
Science.
The
class
definitely
had
a
great
impact
upon
my
writing
and
thinking
about
writing.
The
main
objective
of
the
course
intended
to
introduce
and
develop
the
idea
that
all
academic
disciplines
are
united
and
dependent
upon
each
other,
including
and
especially
Literature
and
science.
In
the
class,
we
were
required
to
write
numerous
papers
based
on
certain
articles
and
books
we
had
read.
Some
of
the
fictional
papers
we
read
were
written
by
doctors,
physicists
and
biologists,
all
of
which
surprised
me
because
1
had
never
thought
that
so
many
scientifically
oriented
people
were
talented
as
fictional
writers
and
even
as
poets.
Realizing
this
helped
me
to
expand
my
writing
style.
1
have
always
thought
of
myself
as
a
scientist,
having
switched
from
a
biology
major
to
a
behavioral
neuroscience
major.
However,
since
I
have
also
always
loved
to
write
and
considered
myself
to
be
a
fairly
good
writer
as
well
as
a
scientist,
I
never
understood
how
the
two
disciplines
could
mesh.
After
taking
my
VAST,
1
much
more
thoroughly
understood
that
science
and
Literature
are
related
and
can
be
used
in
conjunction
with
each
other
for
a
very
effective
paper.
One
of
the
examples
presented
to
me
by
my
VAST
professor
was
an
article
from
a
scientific
journal.
Although
1
have
read
many
of
such
articles
in
the
past
for
research
purposes,
I
had
never
read
one
to
dissect
the
grammatical
and
literary
aspects
found
within
the
scientific
subjects.
I
began
to
realize
how
truly
necessary
good
writing
is
in
presenting
ideas
and
hypotheses
to
any
professional
field.
I
also
began
to
appreciate
my
writing
background
and
the
fact
that
1
was
a
Writing
Associate,
since,
hopefully,
1
will
someday
be
writing
my
own
articles
and
presentations
to
scientific
journals.
This
summer
presented
a
much
more
practical
use
of
the
knowledge
and
experience
1
have
gained
as
a
Writing
Associate.
1
enrolled
in
and
took
two
classes
at
Rutgers
University
in
order
that
I
may
be
able
to
study
abroad
in
the
spring
of
1999.
The
courses
I
took
were
Physiological
Psychology
and
its
corresponding
lab,
both
of
which
were
very
challenging
courses
and
which
required
the
writing
of
a
literature
review
of
the
last
lab
topic
we
had
covered.
As
the
paper
was
our
final
and
most
heavily
weighted
grade,
I
spent
quite
some
time
researching
and
writing
the
paper.
My
hard
work
brought
results
far
better
than
I
had
hoped.
Not
only
did
I
receive
a
'A'
in
both
courses,
but
my
lab
teaching
assistant,
who
is
currently
a
graduate
student
at
Rutgers,
offered
me
an
internship
doing
research
on
the
project
on
which
she
was
working
with
a
professor.
My
TA
told
me
that
she
had
been
impressed
with
my
coursework,
especially
my
writing,
and
needed
some
help
in
her
lab
for
the
remaining
seven
weeks
of
the
summer.
The
professor
running
and
funding
the
research
project
met
with
me
before
my
work
began
to
brief
me
as
to
the
nature
of
the
project
and
my
options
for
compensation
for
my
hours
of
work.
She
made
me
an
offer
I
had
to
consider
for
only
a
few
moments
before
reaching
a
decision.
She
told
me
that
she
would
either
pay
me
an
hourly
rate
or
give
me
authorship
on
the
research
paper
when
it
was
submitted.
Since
she
had
just
told
me
that
her
last
paper
had
been
recently
accepted
to
the
Journal
of
Neuroscience,
which
is
the
most
prestigious
in
our
field,
I
was
fairly
confident
that
the
current
paper
would
also
be
accepted
by
someone.
I
almost
immediately
agreed
to
the
authorship
and
started
my
research
with
her
the
following
week.
The
opportunity
to
work
with
a
woman
who
had
accomplished
so
much
in
her
field
both
as
a
researcher
and
as
an
author
was
very
meaningful
to
me.
I
was
exposed
to
various
neurobiological
research
techniques
and
was
permitted
to
read
some
of
the
papers
in
progress.
From
a
very
young
age,
I
had
hoped
to
someday
publish
something
-1
used
to
dream
of
writing
a
book
-
and
was
now
being
given
the
chance
to
co-author
one
of
those
scientific
research
papers.
I
was
thrilled
and
proud
to
be
a
part
of
such
an
experience.
I
finished
the
internship
this
past
week
and
was
sorry
to
leave
when
so
much
more
work
needs
to
be
done
before
the
submission
of
the
paper.
1
will
most
likely
be
returning
to
Rutgers
over
Winter
Break
and
hope
to
see
the
completion
of
the
paper
at
that
time.
I
simply
cannot
wait
until
the
day
I
can
open
a
research
journal
and
see
my
name
on
top
of
the
article.
I
have
already
joked
with
friends
that
the
first
thing
I
plan
on
doing
if
the
paper
gets
published
is
going
Skillman
at
Lafayette
and
entering
my
name
into
the
library's
search
screen
under
"Author
Search".
My
summer
experience
definitely
gave
me
more
of
an
idea
about
the
direction
I
want
my
life
and
career
to
take.
I
enjoyed
the
research,
but
now
know
that
I
don't
want
to
be
a
researcher
for
any
extended
period
of
time.
1
feel
confident
in
knowing
most
of
what
goes
on
in
preparation
of
a
research
article
for
a
scientific
journal
and
hope
that
my
experience
will
help
me
in
attaining
a
research
position
at
Lafayette
in
the
future.
I
am
also
hopeful
that
my
being
published
may
someday
play
a
positive
role
in
my
getting
into
graduate
school.
Working
with
older
and
more
experienced
professionals
will
undoubtedly
give
me
a
new
way
to
read
my
students'
papers
as
a
WA.
I
have
a
more
expanded
writer's
history
and
have
read
more
diverse
and
difficult
papers,
but
have
understood
much
of
what
I
have
read
This
upcoming
semester,
I
will
be
completely
"switching
gears"
by
taking
Creative
Writing,
which
could
be
considered
the
opposite
of
the
work.
I
did
this
summer.
However,
the
overlap
of
literature
and
science
will
surely
make
me
a
more
diverse
and
well-rounded
Writing
Associate.
To
the
new
students
beginning
their
work
as
WAs,
I
suggest
also
maintaining
a
broad
range
of
writing
styles
and
disciplines.
Such
diversity
creates
a
more
open
mind
in
reading
and
improving
the
writing
of
others,
who
may
or
may
not
share
similar
writing
techniques,
but
who
may
be
excellent
writers
in
their
own
ways.
The
appreciation
of
all
forms
of
writing
is
what
1
feel
makes
for
the
best
Writing
Associate.
