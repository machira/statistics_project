My
history
as
a
writer
has
given
me
experience
in
writing
with
pens,
paper,
and
word
processors;
writing
biographies,
book
reports,
short
stories,
research
papers,
memos,
lab
reports,
and
philosophy
papers;
and
receiving
both
highly
positive
and
highly
negative
criticism.
As
will
be
shown
by
this
brief
account
of
my
history
as
a
writer,
the
writing
practice
that
I
received
in
elementary
and
middle
school
led
me
to
enjoy
writing
and
to
master
and
simultaneously
loose
focus
on
writing
implements,
sentence
structure,
and
grammar.
In
high
school,
my
experience
taught
me
to
develop
an
easily
readable
style
and
to
write
with
my
audience
in
mind.
College
writing
has
utilized
the
abilities
I
developed
in
grade
school
to
give
me
the
ability
to
effectively
communicate
an
idea
to
ongoing
debates.
My
early
memories
of
writing
both
come
from
elementary
school
and
contain
mostly
negative
experience.
My
teachers
in
English
classes
often
required
me
to
write
bibliographies
and
book
reports.
As
I
remember,
the
explanation
of
what
these
assignments
entailed
focused
mostly
on
writing
with
proper
grammar
and
only
using
white-out
three
times
per
page.
I
wrote
these
assignments
with
a
pen
and
paper.
In
accordance
with
the
assignment,
what
I
wrote
was
an
extremely
small
part
of
my
focus.
In
fact,
I
barely
remember
what
the
topics
of
these
papers
actual
were.
Writing
each
letter
in
its
proper
form
and
each
word
in
proper
spelling
was
of
utmost
importance.
If
my
letters
were
too
sloppy
or
if
I
misspelled
more
than
three
words,
I
would
have
the
tedious
requirement
of
rewriting
the
entire
page.
At
this
point
in
my
writing
history,
I
found
writing
tedious,
boring,
and
unimportant.
Towards
the
end
of
elementary
school,
my
mother
encouraged
me
to
enter
a
writing
competition
hosted
by
the
Camden
Aquarium.
The
entry
requirement
was
an
original
short
story
that
incorporated
some
form
of
an
undersea
adventure.
I
reluctantly
assented
to
writing
the
story
and
began
doing
so
on
my
family's
new
computer.
From
this
time
on,
I
used
word
processors
to
write.
While
slowly
typing
each
letter
with
one
finger,
I
wrote
a
short
narrative
about
an
explorer
who
discovered
an
undersea
monster
on
a
submarine
voyage.
My
experience
with
this
type
of
writing
came
entirely
from
the
short
stories
I
had
read.
Beginning
my
narrative
was,
like
all
other
works
I
had
done,
tedious
and
difficult.
Since
I
had
no
in
depth
learning
about
plots
and
character
development,
I
did
not
know
how
to
write
a
short
story
like
the
classics
that
I
had
read.
But
by
the
time
I
reached
the
description
of
the
sea
monster,
I
forgot
the
difficulty
of
writing
my
paper
and
became
interested
in
the
story
I
was
writing.
I
taxed
my
creativity
to
its
fullest
in
coming
up
with
a
description
of
the
monster;
and,
afterwards,
I
was
even
interested
in
revising
my
first
draft.
While
writing
this
paper,
I
found
how
enjoyable
picturing
an
object
and
describing
it
in
words
could
be.
In
the
end,
I
submitted
my
paper,
won
first
place
for
my
age
group,
and
read
the
paper
in
front
of
an
audience
at
the
Camden
Aquarium.
This
competitive
experience
drastically
increased
my
confidence
in
my
writing
abilities.
Throughout
middle
school,
my
experience
in
writing
consisted
of
various
assignments
that
my
English
teacher
(who,
since
I
was
home
schooled
during
this
time,
was
also
my
mother)
found
in
my
English
curriculum.
These
assignments
included
short
stories,
description,
poems,
and
rarely
arguments.
My
interests
almost
entirely
consisted
in
descriptions
and
short
stories.
An
example
of
a
relatively
successful
short
story
that
I
wrote
during
this
time
was
a
theft
story.
The
explanation
of
what
a
short
story
is
did
not
require
much
time
for
this
assignment
since
I
had
recently
finished
studying
the
plots
and
characters
of
a
series
of
short
stories
by
Edgar
Allen
Poe.
I
was
simply
told
to
write
a
story
like
those
that
Poe
wrote.
I
began
with
only
a
general
idea
that
there
would
be
a
thievery
and
that
the
thief
would
be
caught
in
the
end.
I
particularly
remember
developing
the
mood
of
my
paper
with
lengthy
descriptions
of
dreary
city
scenery
as
well
as
the
physical
appearance
and
neurotic
personality
of
the
main
character
and
developing
the
plot
of
the
thievery
and
imprisonment
around
these
descriptions.
After
writing
for
several
days,
I
heard
in
the
news
that
President
Clinton
decided
to
pardon
several
prisoners
as
a
last
act
of
his
presidency.
I
learned
from
my
father
that
Presidents
had
the
right
to
pardon
prisoners
for
whatever
reason
they
decided
and
randomly
through
a
Presidential
pardon
into
the
end
of
my
story.
My
mother's
only
criticism
of
my
paper
related
to
the
randomness
of
my
ending.
Having
a
pardon
did
not
fit
my
overall
theme
of
the
dreary,
hopeless
lives
that
thieves
live.
After
spending
weeks
being
intensely
focused
on
writing
this
story,
I
did
not
appreciate
such
negative
criticism.
In
my
opinion,
my
work
had
nothing
wrong
with
it;
and
my
mother's
criticism
displayed
a
lack
of
expertise
and
taste.
The
majority
of
the
writing
assignments
that
I
accomplished
in
high
school
consisted
of
ten-page
research
papers
that
were
required
each
year
and
did
not
correspond
to
any
particular
class.
All
homeschoolers
in
the
Pennsylvania
Homeschoolers
program
have
the
general
requirement
of
writing
one
ten-paged
paper
each
year.
During
ninth
and
tenth
grade,
my
actual
assignment
was
simply
to
write
a
ten
page
research
paper
on
whatever
topic
I
chose.
In
eleventh
and
twelfth
grade,
this
assignment
description
was
further
expanded
to
require
a
thesis.
My
mother
gave
me
basic
information
concerning
the
idea
that
research
papers
are
informative
papers
that
get
their
information
from
outside
sources,
what
resources
I
should
use
to
do
my
research,
and
how
to
properly
reference
sources.
Clearly,
these
papers
were
open
to
many
possible
subjects
and
required
the
writer
to
essentially
form
his
own
assignment
description.
Throughout
these
papers,
I
focused
intensely
on
style.
I
had
the
idea
during
the
beginning
of
my
high
school
career
that
good
writing
imitated
the
style
of
some
of
the
classic
novels
that
I
had
read.
To
my
mother's
annoyance,
I
also
attempted
to
produce
long
strings
of
combined
sentences
and
utilize
arcane
words.
The
result
of
this
type
of
style
produced
papers
such
as
my
ninth
grade
paper
on
DNA
in
which
I
prided
myself
on
being
able
to
state
a
description
of
the
entire
process
of
protein
production
in
one
incredibly
long
paragraph
that
my
mother
could
not
understand
even
after
reading
it
over
multiple
times.
Needless
to
say,
my
mother
gave
me
some
negative
criticism
about
this
work.
However,
I
had
the
idea
that
the
experts
who
wrote
my
reference
books
were
more
reliable
experts
on
writing
than
my
mother
was.
And
since
I
prided
myself
on
references
science
books
that
were
meant
for
college-level
readers,
the
scientists
that
I
read
wrote
with
a
slightly
arcane
style
that
was
close
to
my
own
in
word
usage.
The
positive
feedback
that
I
did
receive
for
this
paper
related
to
my
ability
to
properly
use
the
biological
terminology
and
understand
my
sources
enough
to
write
a
paper
off
of
them.
In
eleventh
grade,
I
finally
realized
that
no
one
would
appreciate
my
writing
until
I
considered
my
reader
while
developing
my
style.
In
my
junior
research
paper
on
the
Coliseum,
I
began
varying
my
usual
chain
of
long
sentences
with
short
two
to
three
word
sentences.
I
also
tried
to
highlight
significant
points
in
my
papers
by
inserting
chains
of
brief
sentences.
Throughout
my
writing
process,
my
mother
me
stylistic
suggestions
such
as
using
active
verbs
and
keeping
my
sentences
short.
Regardless,
I
often
felt
inadequate
to
fully
be
able
to
imitate
good
style
without
more
formal,
in-depth
training
than
my
mother
gave
me.
In
my
paper
on
the
Coliseum,
I
was
required
to
write
a
thesis
for
the
first
time.
My
mother
informally
taught
me
what
a
thesis
is
by
explaining
the
idea
that
a
thesis
was
both
the
purpose
of
a
paper
and
the
point
I
attempted
to
prove
within
the
paper.
In
eleventh
grade,
I
did
not
even
think
of
my
thesis
statement
until
I
reached
the
conclusion
paragraph.
The
only
mentioning
of
my
thesis
in
this
paper
was
one
sentence
I
quickly
added
to
the
end
of
the
opening
paragraph
and
two
simple
sentences
in
the
concluding
paragraph.
The
body
of
my
paper
explained
the
history
of
the
various
types
of
games
played
in
the
Coliseum
with
minimal
connection
to
my
thesis
that
blamed
the
collapse
of
the
Roman
Empire
partially
on
the
Roman
people's
focus
on
the
Coliseum's
entertainment.
I
based
my
thesis
statement
on
the
idea
of
only
one
source
and
did
not
even
attempt
to
prove
my
thesis
in
the
body
of
my
paper.
My
twelfth
grade
research
paper
written
on
Mahatma
Gandhi's
life
and
beliefs,
failed
to
develop
my
thesis
almost
as
poorly
as
my
eleventh
grade
paper.
This
paper
contained
a
thesis
that
was
more
aggressive
than
my
eleventh-grade
paper's
thesis
but
that
was
also
slightly
developed
within
the
body
of
my
paper.
My
thesis
in
twelfth
grade
was
that
opposing
opinions
in
general
are
caused
by
different
experiences
in
life.
To
prove
this
point
I
briefly
analyzed
the
lives
and
beliefs
of
Mahatma
Gandhi
and
Nietzsche.
My
paper
succeeded
in
tracing
some
of
Gandhi
and
Nietzsche's
contrasting
beliefs
to
emotional
or
drastic
events
in
their
lives.
However,
it
failed
to
universalize
the
idea
that
all
beliefs
come
from
experiences
in
life
and
to
prove
the
idea
that
no
other
factors
are
a
cause
for
a
person's
beliefs.
In
both
of
these
papers,
I
received
positive
feedback
for
my
style
and
research
and
no
feedback
on
my
thesis.
My
first
thought
of
what
college
writing
would
be
like
unsurprisingly
had
a
focus
on
style.
I
thought
that
college
would
be
a
time
when
I
would
finally
learn
all
the
esoteric
secrets
about
how
to
develop
a
professional
writing
style.
In
my
mind,
such
secrets
consisted
of
a
practical
method
that
outlined
such
things
as
how
to
develop
a
proper
rhythm,
how
to
effectively
use
adjectives,
and
how
to
strategically
place
important
words
within
a
sentence.
Throughout
the
first
few
week
of
the
fall
semester
of
my
freshman
year,
I
thought
my
FYS
class
would
provide
this
useful
information.
The
professor
of
my
FYS
assigned
my
first
experience
in
college
writing.
The
assignment
for
this
paper
required
a
thesis
on
Dr.
Edward
Wilson
and
Stephen
Gould's
views
on
any
topic
that
was
discussed
in
class.
I
did
the
needed
research,
stressfully
wrote
my
draft
on
the
ethics
of
stem
cell
research,
and
submitted
the
draft
to
my
professor
who
submitted
it
to
my
WA.
Throughout
the
entire
process,
I
felt
unprepared.
I
never
received
the
systematic
methodology
for
style
that
I
expected
to
get.
I
had
the
feeling
that
college
writing
was
different
than
high
school
writing
but
I
did
not
know
how.
Consequently,
I
cautiously
wrote
my
paper
without
including
any
personal
opinion
and
without
any
experimental
style.
The
first
meeting
with
my
WA
also
went
drastically
different
than
I
planned.
After
receiving
no
instruction
from
my
professor
about
style,
I
thought
I
would
hear
a
critique
of
my
style
from
my
WA.
Instead,
my
WA
helped
me
evaluate
my
paper
in
terms
of
both
my
thesis
and
the
assignment.
Specifically,
my
WA
showed
me
how
I
needed
to
clarify
my
opening
thesis,
give
further
explanation
about
why
Gould
and
Wilson
had
their
opposing
views
about
stem
cell
research,
remove
information
that
was
not
directly
related
to
my
thesis,
and
focus
my
conclusion
to
directly
match
the
thesis
statement
in
my
opening
paragraph.
One
of
the
most
significant
ideas
that
my
WA
showed
me
during
this
first
interview
was
the
importance
a
reader
gives
to
the
thesis
of
a
paper.
By
constantly
focusing
on
my
thesis,
my
WA
clearly
implied
that
a
reader
enjoys
reading
writing
that
has
a
focused
and
well
organized
thesis.
This
idea,
added
to
the
practical
thesis
critiques
that
my
WA
provided,
boosted
my
confidence
in
my
writing
and
focused
my
attention
to
what
information
I
write
instead
of
how
I
write.
My
first
semester
in
college
taught
me
both
how
to
structure
a
thesis
and
to
exclude
any
opinion
from
my
writing.
I
learned
to
begin
the
introduction
by
laying
out
each
point
I
eventual
will
make.
I
would
then
continue
my
paper
by
explaining
each
point
I
already
made
in
my
introduction.
Finally,
I
would
conclude
by
reviewing
the
points
I
had
made
in
the
body
of
my
paper.
The
positive
feedback
I
received
from
the
draft
of
my
first
paper
mostly
consisted
in
the
fact
that
I
simply
presented
the
ideas
of
Dr.
Wilson
and
Gould
without
insert
any
personal
opinions.
My
second
semester
in
college
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
take
a
philosophy
of
ethics
class.
The
two
writing
assignments
involved
in
this
class
not
only
required
research
on
the
current
debate
about
a
theory
in
ethics
but
also
required
arguments
that
proved
one
side
or
idea
in
the
debate.
I
finally
got
my
opportunity
to
contribute
an
idea
to
an
academic
debate.
The
second
paper
that
I
wrote
for
this
class
had
the
assignment
of
evaluating
the
plausibility
of
Kant's
theory
of
ethics
based
on
both
Kant's
"Groundwork
to
the
Metaphysics
of
Ethics"
and
a
contradictory
article
written
by
Philipa
Foot.
I
used
the
structuring
method
that
I
developed
in
my
fall
semester
to
present
my
argument
and
the
strict
logic
I
learned
in
the
ethics
class
to
prove
my
idea
that
Foot
did
not
disprove
Kant.
Because
of
my
careful
use
of
both
of
these
tools
as
well
as
the
rudimentary
skills
I
developed
in
grade
school,
I
received
highly
positive
feedback
from
my
ethics
professor.
My
experience
as
a
writer
has
led
me
to
increasingly
focus
on
using
writing
as
a
means
to
properly
convey
a
meaningful
idea.
My
writing
in
elementary
school
taught
me
to
use
modern
implements
for
writing
and
to
write
in
a
grammatically
correct
way.
My
writing
in
high
school
taught
me
to
write
with
a
style
that
is
easily
readable.
Both
of
these
lessons
served
to
implement
my
ability
to
learn
the
significant
lesson
of
how
to
organize,
present,
and
prove
a
thesis.
