My
History
as
a
Writer
My
writing
history
began
when
I
was
four
years
old.
During
the
summer
of
nineteen
eighty-four
I
used
a
few
pieces
of
newsprint
and
some
black
and
brown
markers
to
painstakingly
combine
the
few
verbs
I
could
write
into
meaningful
action
for
a
four
page
novelette.
I
bent
over
my
paper
and
printed
I
GO
+
EAT
WE
GO
WE
STOP
+
GO
WE
STOP,
using
black
for
the
text
and
brown
to
correct
mistakes.
Then
I
added
a
crooked
drawing
of
a
person's
upper
body,
complete
with
belly
button
and
a
bald
head
and
finished
the
product
with
my
name.
It
was
done!
My
mom
completed
my
book
with
a
pair
of
staples.
In
my
four
year
old
mind,
I
had
practically
been
published.
I
have
always
heard
it
said
that
writers
should
write
what
they
know
.
It
is
quite
obvious
that
I
was
following
this
advice
even
as
a
pre-schooler.
All
of
the
action
included
in
my
story
(and
it
contained
little
else)
pertained
directly
to
me.
In
my
inexperienced
life,
going,
stopping
and
eating
were
parts
of
a
daily
routine.
As
time
passed
and
I
grew
older,
my
interest
in
writing
only
increased.
Like
my
first
attempt
to
convey
ideas
through
symbols,
I
have
always
tried
to
write
carefully
and
about
topics
on
which
I
am
well-informed,
made
sure
to
fix
my
mistakes,
and
illustrated
when
necessary.
Then,
as
now,
my
family,
especially
my
mother,
has
been
vety
involved
in
my
writing,
looking
over
my
rough
products
and
providing
input
and
feedback.
When
I
was
younger
I
used
to
say
that
I
wanted
to
be
a
writer
when
I
grew
up.
Toward
that
end,
I
produced
another
book,
when
I
was
about
seven
or
eight,
this
time
the
fanciful
story
of
a
little
mouse
named
Q-bert.
This
work
came
complete
with
pencil
drawings
and
a
blue
paper
folder
with
brass
fasteners
as
a
binding.
With
this
book
came
slightly
more
success
and
public
exposure
than
my
earlier
attempt.
A
local
librarian
agreed
to
take
the
pencil-scribed
primer
and
circulate
it
with
the
''real"
books.
It
got
a
slip
for
a
library
card
and
probably
a
place
in
the
card
catalogue
as
well.
Although
the
book
was
not
allowed
to
leave
the
library,
the
patrons
seemed
to
enjoy
its
presence,
and
to
my
knowledge
it
is
still
there,
making
people
happy.
This
volume
differs
from
my
first
in
many
ways.
Not
only
was
it
much
more
neatly
presented,
but
it
illustrated
a
jump
in
my
writing
style
from
fact
to
fiction.
I
did
not
know
what
it
was
like
to
be
a
mouse,
or
what
events
actually
happen
to
mice,
but
I
used
what
I
did
know
about
the
animals
and
personified
them.
The
mice
in
my
stoiy
ate,
slept
and
fell
in
love,
all
things
which,
if
not
part
of
my
own
personal
experience,
were
at
least
familiar
to
me.
I
found
that
I
liked
this
kind
of
make-believe.
After
this
I
wrote
almost
exclusively
fiction.
The
next
page
in
my
writing
histoiy
sticks
in
my
mind
not
so
much
for
its
content,
but
for
the
media
in
which
it
was
written.
It
was
a
story
formed
around
an
assigned
sentence,
to
be
read
aloud
in
front
of
my
class.
My
story
involved
a
dog
who
wore
shoes.
I
wrote
and
illustrated
it
when
I
was
twelve,
using
loose-leaf
paper
and
a
four
color
pen
which
now
seems
so
representative
of
the
late
eighties
time
period.
Somewhere
around
fifth
or
sixth
grade
I
became
an
editor,
if
only
for
a
short
time.
My
sister
and
I
had
a
social
studies
book
on
South
America
which
we
absolutely
hated
because
it
was
so
dull.
We
decided
to
create
our
own
book,
using
information
culled
from
the
published
one
and
presented
in
a
more
interesting
fashion.
We
decided
on
one
chapter
for
each
South
American
country,
and
created
a
young
''guide",
a
native
of
the
country,
to
speak
to
the
reader
throughout
the
chapter.
The
pages
of
our
book
were
banged
out
on
an
antique
manual
typewriter
with
many
mistakes
and
illustrated
by
hand.
I
recall
being
disappointed
by
the
finished
product.
It
seemed
impossible
to
make
our
book
that
different
from
the
original
when
all
the
information
came
from
that
one
source.
It
was
an
interesting
project
and
I
learned
more
about
South
America
than
I
ever
thought
I
could,
but
the
book
we
created
was
not
much
better
than
its
parent.
When
I
entered
high
school
I
came
upon
a
new
type
of
writing
which
I
had
yet
to
encounter:
the
essay.
My
English
teacher
prompted
all
the
students
in
her
class
to
never
be
afraid
to
express
an
opinion,
a
lesson
that
hit
home
with
me.
After
imprinting
us
with
that
adage,
she
promptly
took
away
the
use
of
the
pronoun
T
in
our
writing,
and
taught
us
how
to
indirectly
express
opinion.
I
picked
up
this
style
of
writing
immediately.
It
made
me
feel
important
to
write
''the
writer
feels''
or
"it
is
the
opinion
of
the
author
that''.
In
the
same
class
we
practiced
using
the
MLA
guide
and
writing
research
papers
and
works
cited
pages.
My
confidence
in
my
writing
was
boosted
during
my
high
school
years,
but
I
had
a
few
difficult
moments
as
well.
One
day
I
showed
another
teacher
a
draft
of
a
paper
that
I
was
working
on
for
her.
It
was
about
lighthouses
in
Maine,
and
I
still
consider
it
one
of
my
best
pieces
of
writing.
She
pulled
out
her
pen
and
began
marking
my
paper
up
and
down.
I
was
crushed.
The
thing
that
hurt
most
was
that
she
was
trying
to
change
my
writing
style,
the
way
I
said
things,
instead
of
grammatical
or
spelling
mistakes.
I
was
angry
because
I
felt
like
she
thought
her
way
of
expressing
my
ideas
overshadowed
mine.
When
I
showed
my
English
teacher
she
told
me
that
I
did
not
need
to
change
my
style
for
anyone,
unless
I
wanted
to.
I
left
everything
the
same,
and
the
first
teacher
gave
me
an
A.
I
ceased
to
be
taught
anything
new
about
writing
after
my
tenth
grade
year.
That
was
the
year
my
English
teacher
left
my
school.
The
teacher
who
had
criticized
my
writing
took
over
the
English
department,
and
with
that
my
writing
education
ground
to
a
halt.
From
that
point
on
I
learned
writing
by
writing.
This
new
teacher
was
a
veteran
of
the
school
system.
She
had
figured
out
that
it
was
much
easier
to
go
through
the
motions
of
teaching
than
to
actually
teach.
She
gave
out
assignments
and
worksheets,
assigned
reading
in
class,
and
depended
on
projects
and
handouts
to
do
her
teaching
for
her.
We
rarely
got
any
graded
papers
back
from
her,
and
when
we
did
the
pages
were
filled
with
abstract
comments
that
showed
she
was
not
grading
on
the
basis
of
her
own
assignment
prompts.
I
learned
one
skill
from
her
class,
and
that
may
be
all:
the
ability
to
B.S.
my
way
through
an
assignment.
I
knew
she
wasn't
going
to
read
our
papers
that
carefully,
so
why
should
I
put
extra
time
into
writing
them?
If
I
could
believe
the
grades
she
gave
me,
I
soon
became
well-practiced
at
this
skill.
,
As
my
high
school
graduation
approached
I
began
to
worry
about
my
real
writing
aptitude.
I
had
always
gotten
high
marks
in
English,
but
with
this
teacher
I
couldn't
say
if
the
grades
were
real
or
merely
an
indication
of
whether
she
liked
me
or
thought
I
was
smart.
But
for
most
of
my
senior
year
I
was
caught
up
in
applying
to
colleges
and
filling
out
scholarship
applications
and
I
didn't
have
much
time
to
dwell
on
my
literate
shortcomings.
Next
I
found
myself
setting
foot
on
the
Lafayette
campus
for
the
first
time.
I
had
long
dreamed
about
this
day,
and
now
I
was
finally
in
college.
Of
course
I
missed
friends
and
family,
but
soon
another
wony
took
hold:
my
First
Year
Seminar
class.
What
if
it
were
true
and
I
couldn
t
write
as
well
as
the
professors
desired?
I
started
my
first
paper
well
in
advance
of
its
due
date.
For
the
first
time
in
a
long
time,
I
researched
completely
and
wrote
nothing
but
fact.
When
I
met
with
my
WA
to
discuss
my
paper,
I
was
surprised
to
hear
her
tell
me
that
it
was
a
pretty
good
paper.
I
took
her
suggestions
and
anxiously
handed
the
assignment
in.
Strangely,
even
when
the
paper
was
returned
with
positive
comments
and
a
good
grade,
my
confidence
increased
veiy
little.
I
still
feared
that
maybe
my
professor
liked
me",
as
opposed
to
truly
critiquing
my
written
work.
In
the
months
that
followed,
and
due
mostly
to
my
W
A
and
several
more
good
grades,
I
was
finally
able
to
overcome
my
confidence
block.
I
began
to
feel
that
maybe
I
really
was
a
good
writer
after
all.
It
was
now
nearly
December
of
last
year.
As
I
sat
in
front
of
a
white
computer
screen
and
stared
at
a
blinking
cursor
the
nervousness
began
to
come
back.
I
had
only
a
week
left
in
which
to
write
an
eight
page
final
paper
on
why
Americans
view
Mexicans
as
violent
people
for
my
FYS
class.
I
gathered
my
notes
around
me
and
began
writing.
As
I
did
so
I
noticed
something
strange
happening.
Because
I
was
not
as
prepared
for
this
paper
as
I
had
been
for
the
others,
I
slipped
almost
unconsciously
back
into
my
high
school
method
of
writing.
Perhaps
I
felt
that
I
should
test
it
out,
and
see
if
I
had
been
doing
too
much
work
on
my
papers.
That
is
not
to
say
that
I
did
not
work
on
this
final
writing
assignment.
It
just
was
not
as
organized,
not
nearly
as
well
thought
out
as
my
others
had
been.
When
I
got
the
paper
back
I
expected
the
worst.
The
reality:
I
got
my
best
grade
yet.
In
a
way
I
was
pleased,
but
also
confused.
Did
that
really
mean
that
I
wrote
the
same
at
my
worst
as
I
did
at
my
best?
It
is
a
question
that
I
have
yet
to
answer.
As
this
paper
is
the
last
thing
I
have
written
at
this
point,
I
suppose
it
would
make
a
good
ending
to
a
history
of
my
writing.
This
paper
was
written
much
like
the
ones
I
produced
in
high
school
and
college:
I
pecked
away,
cutting
and
editing
right
in
front
of
a
computer.
When
I
had
a
good
rough
draft,
I
printed
it
out
and
showed
it
to
my
mom,
who
has
always
been
my
best
critic.
She
pointed
out
some
mistakes,
and
gave
me
a
few
ideas
which
I
encorporated
into
this
paper.
She
also
told
me
that
in
her
opinion,
my
paper
was
good.
This
was
very
important
to
me,
because
I
was
afraid
that
I
was
straying
from
the
prompt.
With
her
input,
I
turned
back
to
the
paper,
hammered
out
the
rough
spots,
and
am
about
to
print
out
a
final
copy.
As
I
write
more
in
the
years
to
come,
I
hope
to
always
continue
putting
into
practice
those
writing
skills
which
I
knew
instinctively
at
age
four.
Because
as
long
as
I
keep
going,
eating
and
stopping,
I
will
probably
always
be
writing.
