My
first
brush
with
pen
and
paper
happened
when
I
was
seven
years
old.
It
was
when
my
second
grade
teacher
assigned
us
the
task
of
writing
and
illustrating
our
own
short
stories.
Ever
since
I
learned
how
to
read
at
age
four,
I
knew
that
I
loved
the
places
that
books
transported
me.
The
idea
that
I
myself
could
create
such
adventures
on
paper
was
amazing
to
me.
With
the
advent
of
this
joy
came
the
simultaneous
arrival
of
a
pain
that
has
plagued
me
ever
since:
how
to
make
my
writing
perfect?
This
simple
little
assignment
was
the
beginning
of
a
volatile
love
affair
between
words
and
myself.
Looking
back,
the
plot
to
my
very
first
story
was,
I
have
to
admit,
a
bit
melodramatic.
One
day
as
I
was
walking
in
the
dark
woods
with
only
my
dog
Eddie
for
company,
I
happened
to
stumble
into
a
particularly
nasty
puddle
of
quicksand.
Luckily,
my
very
strong
and
very
brave
father
came
to
the
rescue.
I
still
can
remember
being
the
last
to
finish;
even
at
seven
I
had
a
hard
time
feeling
satisfied
with
the
end
product.
Of
course
my
teacher
and
parents
were
highly
supportive
and
complimentary
and
to
this
day
my
mother
still
has
those
few
pieces
of
construction
paper
bound
together
with
yarn
saved
in
a
box
along
with
all
the
rest
of
my
writing
endeavors
through
the
years.
My
wobbly
letters
float
over
the
stick
figures
and
globs
of
marker
meant
to
be
people
and
trees;
each
one
painstakingly
crafted
with
pencil
to
form
words
that
come
so
easily
to
me
now.
In
elementary
school,
my
teachers
instructed
us
in
grammar
and
assigned
us
small
writing
projects
to
do,
but
I
also
found
myself
writing
outside
of
school.
I
started
my
first
journal
when
I
was
eight
years
old.
I
had
recently
given
up
on
my
ambition
to
be
a
supermarket
clerk
and
now
absolutely
knew
what
I
wanted
to
be
when
I
grew
up:
a
writer.
After
sharing
this
piece
of
information
with
my
third
grade
teacher
she
told
me
that
many
authors
kept
journals.
Writing
daily,
she
informed
me,
would
only
help
my
writing
grow.
Through
the
years
I
have
gone
through
many
journals
and
it
has
always
been
interesting
to
look
back
over
what
I
have
written.
The
many
story
fragments
that
I
have
started
but
never
finished
remind
me
of
a
quilt
riddled
with
holes
interrupting
each
squareOs
pattern.
I
knew
that
I
loved
to
write,
but
each
time
I
started
I
would
reach
a
point
in
the
story
where
I
just
could
not
see
the
way
to
the
end.
I
was
very
fortunate
to
attend
a
small
private
school
that
placed
a
strong
emphasis
on
critical
reading
and
writing
from
first
grade
to
senior
year.
In
school,
I
grew
to
learn
the
structure
and
form
of
academic
writing
and
received
much
practice
in
writing
papers.
In
middle
school
we
were
required
to
take
a
class
centered
on
writing
research
papers
and
essays
for
school.
While
many
of
my
friends
and
classmates
groaned
when
a
paper
was
assigned
for
a
class,
I
always
felt
more
in
my
element
before
a
computer
screen
with
the
fresh
whiteness
of
a
blank
word
document
before
me
I
began
to
realize
that
not
only
did
I
enjoy
writing,
but
was
good
at
it
as
well.
The
essays
I
wrote
for
English
class
consistently
received
good
grades
and
the
rest
of
my
teachers
seemed
impressed
by
the
writing
I
did
for
their
classes.
In
my
freshman
year
history
class,
we
were
all
informed
that
we
would
be
competing
in
National
History
Day.
We
could
choose
our
topic
and
whether
we
would
write
a
paper,
create
a
poster
board,
or
stage
a
performance.
To
no
surprise,
I
chose
to
write
a
paper,
and
for
the
first
time
truly
tested
my
skills
at
research
paper
writing.
What
my
school
had
done
a
good
job
of
instilling
in
the
students
was
that
there
was
not
just
one
type
of
writing,
each
discipline
required
a
different
approach,
a
different
style.
Working
closely
with
my
history
teacher,
I
learned
how
to
make
an
educated
argument
and
support
a
thesis
with
factual
evidence
while
still
creating
an
interesting
and
engaging
paper.
I
also
learned
the
value
of
revision
through
the
many
that
I
conducted
on
that
paper.
After
finally
handing
in
a
finished
copy,
I
saw
my
hard
work
and
skill
recognized
when
my
paper
was
one
of
two
chosen
to
be
presented
at
the
state
level
for
the
competition.
I
remember
clearly
the
surprise
I
felt
when
the
results
were
announced;
I
thought
that
my
paper
had
needed
even
more
work
done
to
it.
The
feeling
that
there
was
something
missing
from
my
paper
was
one
that
I
experienced
almost
every
time
I
handed
in
an
assignment
for
school.
Yet,
most
of
the
time
my
teachers
praised
me
on
the
depth
of
my
argument
and
the
organization
of
the
paper.
It
baffled
me
that
quite
often
the
papers
that
I
begrudgingly
handed
in
received
some
of
the
highest
praise.
I
moved
from
English
class
to
English
class
through
the
years,
but
it
was
not
until
my
sophomore
year
that
I
felt
like
my
writing
actually
was
visibly
improved.
Mr.
Shotwell
was
an
infamous
figure
at
my
high
school.
He
managed
at
one
time
to
be
both
menacingly
intimidating
and
one
of
the
most
popular
teachers.
His
English
classes
were
legendary
(or
notorious)
for
being
grueling,
but
it
was
the
general
consensus
that
after
just
one
of
his
classes,
your
writing
grew
in
leaps
and
bonds.
I
walked
into
his
classroom
ready
for
success.
While
I
would
not
call
it
cocky,
I
was
definitely
used
to
excelling
in
the
English
classroom.
Mr.
Shotwell,
however,
had
different
plans.
In
our
first
class
together,
he
pushed
me
harder
than
any
of
my
previous
teachers.
While
I
was
content
with
providing
the
safe
answers
and
using
the
same
formulas
for
my
essays
that
had
assured
me
success
in
all
my
other
classes,
Mr.
Shotwell
shook
me
out
of
my
complacency
and
forced
me
to
test
my
limits
and
stretch
my
boundaries.
I
would
go
on
to
have
him
as
my
English
teacher
for
the
next
two
years,
but
that
first
year
was
when
I
did
the
most
growing.
Every
essay
that
he
handed
back
was
scrawled
with
his
comments.
I
could
not
get
a
perfect
grade
in
that
class,
it
was
impossible.
I
remember
one
occasion
when
I
finally
approached
him
about
what
I
considered
his
unreasonable
unfairness.
NI
just
donOt
know
what
you
want
from
me?O
I
asked
desperately.
Everything
that
I
had
done
in
my
other
classes
and
received
such
praise
from
was
just
mediocre
for
Mr.
Shotwell.
At
the
time,
I
was
incredibly
frustrated,
but
now
I
am
grateful.
Mr.
Shotwell
knew
that
I
was
only
giving
half
of
what
I
could,
that
I
could
look
beyond
the
obvious
answers
in
my
essays
and
throw
away
all
the
tired
old
clichs.
Many
times
he
would
urge
our
class
to
go
further,
making
connections
between
texts
and
using
outside
sources
to
support
our
arguments.
The
single
most
rewarding
experience
of
my
writing
career
so
far
has
been
when
I
received
a
perfect
grade
from
Mr.
Shotwell.
It
did
not
happen
until
my
junior
year,
but
when
I
received
that
essay
back
and
the
only
comment
was
NexcellentO,
all
my
hard
work,
sweat,
and
tears
seemed
worth
it.
Over
the
years
I
formed
I
strong
bond
with
Mr.
Shotwell
and
the
second
most
rewarding
experience
happened
when
he
asked
me
to
compete
in
a
high
school
writing
competition
where
the
students
were
nominated
by
their
teachers
to
submit
a
sample
writing
of
an
academic
essay
and
either
a
short
story
or
poem.
I
was
so
flattered
that
Mr.
Shotwell
believed
that
I
was
worthy
enough
to
put
my
writing
out
there
to
be
judged.
I
was
also
very
nervous
to
share
a
piece
of
writing
that
had
not
been
assigned
for
school.
I
went
back
to
the
journals
filled
with
half-finished
bits
and
pieces
of
stories
and
knew
that
I
had
to
finally
finish
one.
I
worked
closely
with
Mr.
Shotwell
to
polish
one
story
I
had
started
about
a
young
girl
who
goes
to
visit
her
grandfather
in
a
nursing
home.
I
learned
that
my
strengths
were
in
conveying
images
and
details,
but
also
that
I
went
too
far
sometimes
into
the
details
and
needed
to
trust
the
intelligence
of
my
readers.
Mr.
Shotwell
also
helped
me
improve
my
writing
by
instilling
in
me
the
necessity
of
creating
multiple
drafts.
I
had
always
scoffed
at
the
idea
of
a
rough
draft,
and
while
I
always
went
over
my
papers
before
handing
them
in,
it
was
not
until
Mr.
Shotwell
required
a
rough
draft
to
be
handed
in
that
I
felt
that
I
had
found
the
answer
to
my
desired
perfection
dilemma.
It
was
only
by
going
through
the
entire
act
of
writing
a
paper
that
I
would
actually
find
my
thesis
statement
or
main
argument
come
to
life
in
the
end
of
my
first
draft.
In
the
end,
I
did
not
place
in
the
competition,
but
that
did
not
ruin
the
entire
experience
for
me.
I
was
disappointed
that
the
judges
did
not
see
more
value
in
my
work,
but
the
fact
that
I
was
nominated
gave
a
lift
to
my
self
confidence
and
gave
me
the
courage
to
start
submitting
pieces
to
local
competitions
and
magazines.
In
senior
year
when
it
came
time
to
begin
writing
college
essays,
I
felt
the
benefits
of
the
growth
my
writing
had
undergone
first
hand.
The
college
guidance
counselor
for
my
school
had
warned
all
the
students
of
the
treacherous
college
essay
and
many
of
my
friends
avoided
writing
theirs
as
if
even
starting
it
would
cause
their
fingers
to
fall
off
or
their
eyes
to
roll
out
of
their
heads.
I
actually
relished
the
chance
to
show
the
colleges
more
of
who
I
was
as
a
person
than
grades
on
a
paper
and
a
list
of
extracurriculars.
My
goals
for
writing
the
perfect
essay
were
to
display
the
quality
and
level
of
writing
while
also
revealing
my
personality
and
identity.
I
wanted
to
find
my
voice
and
let
that
shine
through.
As
I
worked
on
the
first
draft
of
my
essay,
I
found
myself
silently
asking
myself
the
questions
that
I
knew
Mr.
Shotwell
would
have.
The
words
swiftly
appeared
upon
the
computer
page
as
my
fingers
skipped
over
the
keyboard;
I
knew
exactly
what
I
wanted
to
say.
I
knew
that
I
wanted
to
avoid
the
usual
essay
topics
of
writing
about
an
important
or
influential
person
in
my
life,
or
some
event
that
changed
me
or
made
me
who
I
was.
I
did
not
write
about
a
mission
trip
to
Guatemala
or
saving
sea
turtles
in
Florida.
While
those
are
all
interesting
and
commendable
themes,
I
wanted
my
essay
to
show
who
I
was
in
a
different
way.
I
wrote
about
the
plays
that
my
sister
and
I
put
on
as
children.
The
magic
that
we
created
from
our
imaginations
was
something
that
I
had
thought
escaped
me
as
I
grew
older,
but
only
went
beneath
the
surface.
I
wanted
my
essay
to
stand
out
from
the
rest
not
only
in
style
but
also
content.
I
thank
my
teachers
for
showing
me
the
importance
and
the
possibility
of
going
outside
of
the
mold.
After
I
finally
was
happy
with
my
essay,
I
sent
it
off
along
with
the
rest
of
my
applications.
I
had
done
the
best
I
could
do
and
now
the
only
thing
left
was
to
wait.
From
this
process
though,
I
gained
the
confidence
in
my
own
writing
ability
and
even
started
to
question
some
of
the
comments
made
by
my
teachers
on
my
essays.
One
time,
when
I
stood
up
for
a
section
in
my
essay
that
Mr.
Shotwell
thought
was
unnecessary,
instead
of
being
angry
as
I
expected
him
to
be,
he
was
pleased.
NI
finally
feel,O
he
said
to
me,
Nlike
I
have
taught
you
something.O
He
told
me
that
quite
often
he
was
right,
but
that
sometimes
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
question
his
comments
and
feel
confident
in
my
own
judgment.
NIOm
not
teaching
you
to
be
a
parrot,O
he
would
always
tell
our
class,
Nbut
to
strengthen
your
own
voice.O
With
those
words
of
wisdom
ringing
in
my
ears,
I
stepped
onto
the
Lafayette
College
campus
ready
to
take
on
the
world.
That
is,
until
my
very
first
English
class.
As
we
went
around
the
classroom
introducing
ourselves
and
stating
our
years
and
majors
I
felt
a
heavy
stone
of
dread
settle
in
my
stomach.
There
were
two
other
freshmen
in
the
class,
the
rest
were
all
upper
classmen
and
mostly
English
majors.
To
say
that
I
was
not
intimidated
would
be
a
very
bad
lie.
I
suddenly
found
myself
questioning
my
talent
and
longing
for
the
comfortable
English
class
of
my
high
school.
I
thought
that
I
was
a
good
writer
in
high
school,
but
this
was
college,
definitely
a
bigger
pond.
It
took
me
a
few
classes
to
become
more
at
ease,
and
by
the
time
our
first
assignment
was
due
I
was
not
as
nervous
as
I
had
been
before.
The
feeling
of
dread,
however,
quickly
came
back
when
it
was
time
for
our
essays
to
be
returned
to
us.
To
my
great
surprise,
my
professor
had
nothing
but
complimentary
things
to
say
and
by
the
end
of
the
semester
was
urging
me
to
consider
English
as
a
major.
I
found
myself
going
through
freshman
year
with
relative
ease.
Although
there
were
many
changes
to
adjust
to,
I
once
again
found
familiar
territory
with
my
trusty
word
documents.
I
handled
essays
for
my
English
class
and
two
major
papers
for
my
freshman
seminar
and
other
various
writing
assignments
with
the
same
confidence
that
had
been
instilled
in
me
throughout
my
years
of
school.
I
believe
that
this
confidence
in
your
own
abilities
and
in
the
value
of
what
you
are
writing
is
a
large
part
of
being
comfortable
with
writing
and
a
good
writer.
It
has
taken
me
many
years
to
learn
this,
and
I
hope
to
grow
further
with
my
writing
and
this
confidence
in
the
years
to
come.
