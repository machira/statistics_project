My
History
As
A
Writer
For
as
long
as
I
can
remember,
I
have
loved
to
write,
I
have
one
sister
who
is
older
than
me
by
twenty
months.
Always
the
more
outgoing
and
daring
of
the
two,
she
spent
much
of
her
time
as
a
child
taking
lessons
in
acting,
singing,
and
dancing.
In
great
contrast
to
her.
I
was
a
rather
reserved
little
girl
who
much
preferred
to
be
off
on
my
own,
writing
a
simple
child's
poem
about
Christmas,
or
writing
a
script
for
my
friends
to
later
perform.
Looking
back,
I
am
certain
that
my
earliest
writing
experiences
occurred
outside
of
the
classroom.
My
mother
is
a
fourth
grade
teacher,
and
I
notice
that
writing
plays
a
much
greater
role
in
the
curriculum
than
it
did
when
I
progressed
through
elementary
school.
At
that
time,
handwriting
was
probably
given
more
emphasis
than
was
the
actual
creative
writing
process.
My
handwriting
was
atrocious,
and
it
is
perhaps
a
small
miracle
that
my
struggles
with
writing
legibly
did
not
turn
me
off
from
writing
altogether.
While
I
can
recall
a
multitude
of
different
writings
that
I
did
on
my
own
initiative
during
my
primary
years,
two
works
stand
out
in
my
mind
particularly
as
being
solid
representations
of
my
development
as
a
writer
during
the
formative
years,
The
earlier
of
these
is
a
purple
blank
book
with
a
rainbow
on
the
front
cover
which
I
received
from
my
aunt
as
a
Christmas
present
in
1982.
At
this
point
in
my
life
I
was
composing
very
basic,
sing-songish
poems
for
every
major
holiday,
and
sharing
these
works,
in
which
I
took
great
pride,
at
holiday
family
gatherings.
My
Aunt
Kate
gave
me
the
book
with
the
suggestion
that
I
use
it
to
record
in
one
place
all
of
my
poems,
and
I
thought
this
to
he
a
fine
idea.
Year
by
year
the
book
grew
and
I
experimented
with
other
types
of
poems,
such
as
cinquains
and
haikus
(such
forms
of
poetry
were
introduced
to
me
in
school
in
perhaps
third
or
fourth
grade).
I
treasure
that
book
to
this
day
because
of
the
vivid
memories
that
are
triggered
upon
reading
any
of
the
works,
When
I
return
to
the
purple
journal
now,
I
can
often
remember
the
particular
place
where
I
was,
and,
more
importantly,
the
precise
feeling
that
I
was
experiencing,
at
the
time
that
I
wrote
the
particular
poem.
The
ability
to
relive
an
experience
through
recording
it
in
writing
to
later
reread
it
is,
in
my
opinion,
what
most
contributes
to
writing
being
the
valuable
and
powerful
resource
that
it
is.
The
second
example
of
my
development
as
a
young
writer
acting
upon
my
own
initiative
is
a
little
newspaper
(just
one
notebook
paper,
both
sides)
that
I
wrote
every
Friday
in
fifth
grade,
which
I
called
The
Cotton
Tale
News
(I
was
going
through
a
rabbit
stage).
I
am
not
sure
if
Mrs.
Fryling
was
aware
of
the
paper,
Every
student
in
the
class
was,
however,
and
the
single
copy
that
I
produced
would
circulate
around
the
room,
from
student
to
student,
as
we
diligently
performed
our
seat
work.
Unfortunately.
I
did
not
save
the
papers,
but
I
am
able
to
recall
their
basic
format
and
content.
Each
paper
consisted
of
a
weather
report,
several
articles
on
activities
relating
to
the
classroom,
a
section
of
riddles,
and
either
a
crossword
puzzle
or
a
seek
&
find.
One
thing
that
I
recall
about
my
writing
at
that
time
is
that
my
descriptions
were
hardly
ordinary.
It
was
never
a
rainy
day
according
to
a
weather
report
in
The
Cotton
Tale
News,
but
rather
a
day
in
which,
for
example,
a
prominent
family
of
clouds
had
experienced
the
death
of
a
loved
one,
and
thus
all
of
the
clouds
were
crying
uncontrollably,
mourning
their
loss.
While
most
of
my
earliest
writing
was
self-motivated,
I
can
recall
several
assignments
in
elementary
school
that
assisted
me
in
developing
writing
skills.
Book
reports,
the
first
type
of
report
to
which
I
was
introduced,
confronted
me
in
third
grade,
and
I
had
positive
associations
with
them
from
the
start,
This
was
due
partly
to
the
fact
that
I
loved
reading,
and
partly
to
the
interesting
projects
that
accompanied
these
reports,
such
as
the
construction
of
dioramas,
or
the
dressing
up
as
a
character
from
the
novel.
Another
thing
I
recall
from
elementary
school
is
instruction
on
writing
an
organized
paragraph;
one
specific
paragraph
I
can
remember
having
to
write
in
third
grade
was
entitled
How
to
Make
a
Peanut
Butter
Sandwich,
Such
assignments
taught
me
to
view
writing
as
something
that,
in
addition
to
being
done
for
pure
entertainment,
could
also
be
engaged
in
for
more
concrete
reasons,
such
as
instruction
or
persuasion.
No
doubt,
these
lessons
in
paragraph
organization
helped
me
write
the
fifty
word
essay
that
I
entered
into
a
contest
announced
in
our
local
paper
on
the
following
topic;
Why
My
Elementary
School
is
the
Best
in
the
Region.
I
was
one
of
four
runner-ups
in
the
contest,
and
won
tickets
for
my
family
to
see
Donny
and
Marie
Osmond
in
concert
(O.K.,
so
it
would
not
exactly
be
my
favorite
musical
choice
now,
but,
as
a
young
child,
the
idea
of
winning
anything
was
fairly
exciting)!
The
Middle
School
years
probably
affected
my
development
as
an
individual
more
than
they
did
my
growth
as
a
writer.
Still,
several
occurrences
that
contributed
to
my
progression,
which
again
occurred
both
in
and
out
of
school,
deserve
mention.
Throughout
elementary
school
the
pencil
had
consistently
been
the
preferred
writing
implement.
Suddenly,
in
sixth
grade,
teachers
were
requesting,
and
at
times
even
requiring,
that
final
drafts
of
papers
be
written
in
blue
or
black
ink.
I
was
O.K..
with
the
pen,
but
my
hand
was
definitely
somewhat
shaky
in
the
beginning.
Throughout
middle
school
my
rough
copies
continued
to
be
produced
with
the
more
cautious
pencil.
I
rarely
utilize
pencils
anymore,
but,
interestingly
enough,
am
presently
writing
this
rough
draft
with
a
pencil
and
am
rather
enjoying
it,
In
seventh
grade
I
began
writing
for
Drumbeat,
the
school
paper,
and
was
asked
to
be
the
editor-in-chief
by
Mrs.
Gabai,
the
sponsor,
during
my
eighth
grade
year.
This
was
a
highly
valuable
experience
for
me,
in
retrospect.
In
addition
to
writing
a
multitude
of
pieces
myself
(mostly
editorials,
on
everything
from
the
importance
of
counting
one's
change
before
leaving
a
store
to
the
advantages
of
adopting
a
mutt
from
the
local
animal
shelter
over
buying
an
expensive
purebred
from
the
pet
store),
I
had
the
unique
opportunity
to
discuss
various
possibilities
for
pieces
with
fellow
students
and,
from
time
to
time,
discuss
articles
they
had
produced
and
given
to
me
to
receive
my
reaction.
Such
discussions
not
only
helped
me
develop
skills
in
effectively
giving
feedback
to
others
but,
more
importantly,
exposed
me
to
the
various
writing
styles
and
perspectives
of
my
peers.
Finally,
I
recall
two
activities
in
middle
school
English
classes
that
marked
new
experiences
for
me
as
a
writer.
Seventh
grade
was
the
first
year
that
literature
became
the
central
component
of
English
class.
While
prior
to
seventh
grade
essays
had
been
written
on
various
topics,
we
were
suddenly
being
asked
to
write
about
the
books
that
we
were
reading,
specifically
about
the
themes
and
characters
in
novels
such
as
Treasure
Island
and
Adventures
of
Tom
Sawyer.
The
other
new
element
in
writing
class
was
the
widespread
use
of
the
Journal
particularly
in
eighth
grade.
Mrs.
Bougher,
my
eighth
grade
English
teacher,
would
have
a
question
written
on
the
board
everyday
when
we
entered
class.
Sometimes
this
question
would
be
related
to
something
we
were
reading,
and
other
times
it
would
be
completely
random,
We
would
respond
to
the
question
for
about
fifteen
minutes.
Mrs.
Bougher
would
read
our
ideas
and
then
respond
to
them,
with
comments
sometimes
amounting
to
more
than
one
page.
I
greatly
enjoyed
this
type
of
correspondence.
For
the
first
time,
I
was
gaining
extensive
feedback
from
a
teacher
pertaining
to
my
views
and
logical
reasoning,
rather
than
the
standard
concentration
on
spelling
and
punctuation.
I
suppose
journals
made
a
great
impression
on
me,
for
it
was
at
this
time
that
I
began
keeping
a
journal
at
home.
Since
then
I
have
on
and
off
kept
a
journal,
although
there
are
lapses
in
my
diary
as
great
as
a
year;
I
have
never
been
very
faithful.
I
have
enjoyed
much
more
success
in
keeping
a
journal
for
limited
amounts
of
time.
For
example,
it
was
during
my
middle
school
years
that
I
began
keeping
very
elaborate
scrapbooks
of
family
vacations
(a
habit
which
I
still
have,
and
exercised
as
recently
as
one
week
ago).
Almost
every
summer
of
my
childhood
my
family
drove
to
a
different
section
of
the
country
and,
in
addition
to
recording
the
times
down
to
the
very
second
at
which
we
entered
every
highway,
paid
every
toll,
stopped
at
every
gas
station,
etc.
(yes,
I
was
slightly
compulsive,
or
maybe
extremely
bored,
during
these
extended
car
rides),
I
wrote
lengthy
entries
each
evening
that
described
the
events
of
the
day
in
detail,
These
entries
were
written
more
for
the
audience
of
my
family
than
they
were
as
entries
in
a
personal
journal,
and
perhaps
represent
the
closest
that
I
come
to
humorous
writing.
I
mentioned
earlier
that
the
recording
of
experiences
is
one
of
my
favorite
types
of
writing,
and
I
feel
that
this
began
to
take
on
great
significance
for
me
during
the
middle
school
years.
Although
I
often
criticize
Plymouth-White
marsh
High
School,
my
alma
mater,
for
its
various
shortcomings,
I
have
always
been
grateful
for
its
strong
writing
program
.
Up
until
this
point
in
my
life,
it
has
been
the
single
place
where
I
have
matured
the
most
as
a
writer.
I
will
always
feel
greatly
indebted
to
the
instruction
in
writing
that
was
provided
to
me
by
my
teachers
there
of
all
four
years.
To
my
ninth
and
tenth
grade
teachers.
I
am
thankful
for
the
large
amount
of
experience
that
I
gained
in
all
different
types
of
writing:
the
paper
to
inform,
the
paper
to
persuade,
the
paper
to
instruct,
as
well
as
more
creative
forms
of
writing,
such
as
short
stories
and
poetry.
Moreover,
ninth
grade
was
the
first
year
in
which
peer
conferences
became
a
regular
part
of
the
writing
process.
Upon
turning
in
every
rough
draft,
each
student
would
be
assigned
a
partner,
and
the
two
students
would
offer
feedback
to
each
other.
I
had
some
familiarity
with
this
procedure
due
to
my
time
working
on
Drumbeat,
and
I
became
only
more
comfortable
with
such
a
setting
as
these
peer
conferences
became
more
frequent.
Tenth
grade
was
further
monumental
for
my
writing
because
it
was
the
year
in
which
I
first
completely
grasped
the
concept
of
the
research
paper.
While
I
had
written
a
multitude
of
term
papers
during
middle
school,
such
reports
were
fairly
limited
to
summarizing
the
ideas
and
findings
of
others.
It
was
not
until
I
wrote
a
research
paper
in
Mr.
Goodwin
s
history
class,
on
the
effects
of
the
war
on
the
feminist
movement,
that
I
grasped
that
the
writing
of
a
research
paper
is
an
incredibly
lengthy
yet
exciting
process,
which
involves
immersing
one's
self
in
all
materials
one
can
find
bearing
a
relation
to
one
s
topic,
and
then
drawing
one's
own
conclusions
based
on
these
sources,
and
finally
writing
these
conclusions
down
while
backing
each
one
up
with
facts
and
the
findings
of
others.
Before
tenth
grade,
many
of
my
papers
did
not
have
much
of
a
point,
Writing
with
a
definite
purpose,
and
a
clearly
thought
out
thesis,
greatly
changed
my
writing,
and
made
me
develop
a
true
passion
for
the
writing
of
research
papers.
Eleventh
grade
English
class,
without
question,
was
the
single
most
important
year
in
my
development
as
a
writer.
Mr,
Walters
actually
taught
his
students
how
to
write
a
paper,
if
such
a
feat
is
possible.
He
promised
that
his
formula,
the
Walterian
wonder,
if
learned,
was
not
the
only
way,
but
definitely
a
guaranteed-to-succeed
way.
to
write
any
paper
on
any
subject.
According
to
Mr,
Walters,
the
first
paragraph
was
to
be
a
blueprint
for
the
rest
of
the
paper.
This
paragraph
was
to
contain
one
sentence
stating
the
thesis
of
the
paper,
and
one
sentence
listing
the
goody
bags
of
the
paper,
or
the
ways
in
which
the
thesis
was
to
be
proved.
Each
goody
bag
would
be
developed
into
one
or
more
paragraphs,
and
one
would
know
that
it
was
time
to
conclude
the
essay
when
one
ran
out
of
goody
bags
to
discuss.
I
continue
to
both
champion
and
utilize
the
goody
bag
method
today.
It
is
so
simple,
and
yet
adherence
to
it
faithfully
results
in
well-organized
papers
in
which
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
stray
from
the
thesis.
I
spent
my
senior
year
in
high
school
further
practicing
the
Walterian
wonder,
as
well
as
trying
my
hand
at
more
creative
types
of
writing.
Mr.
Votto,
my
morbid
yet
interesting
English
teacher,
preferred
this
type
of
writing
to
the
traditional
essay,
and
often
had
us
do
such
things
as
write
a
series
of
diary
entries
of
Emma
Bovary,
or
compose
our
own
modern
day
Canterbury
tale.
Mr.
Votto
was
also
my
first
English
teacher
who
insisted
that
our
papers
be
typed.
I
hold
computers
in
medium
esteem
now,
and
definitely
disliked
them
then,
so
typing
my
papers
was
a
true
challenge
that
first
year.
I
recall
Mr.
Votto
predicting
that
no
matter
how
adamant
some
of
us
were
in
thinking
that
we
could
only
compose
in
front
of
a
piece
of
paper
with
pen
in
hand,
there
would
come
a
time
when
our
thoughts
would
flow
just
as
well,
or
even
better,
in
front
of
a
computer
keyboard,
Mr,
Votto
was
correct,
at
least
in
my
case.
The
progression
has
been
relatively
slow,
but
often
now
I
will
brainstorm
and
write
my
opening
paragraph
on
paper,
and
then
proceed
immediately
to
the
computer.
Plymouth-Whitemarsh
High
School
sent
me
to
college
feeling
fairly
confident
in
my
writing
ability.
I
did
very
little
writing
in
classes
during
my
first
year
at
college.
My
sophomore
year
was
the
year
in
which
I
transferred
to
Lafayette.
I
recall
that
through
both
an
English
class
and
a
Government
class,
I
rediscovered
the
value
of
free
writes
as
a
way
of
brainstorming
for
ideas
(I
had
done
this
for
a
short
time
in
ninth
grade,
but
not
since
then).
During
my
junior
year
at
college
I
had
a
professor
who,
rather
than
insisting
that
we
write
weekly
responses,
gave
us
the
option
of
keeping
reading
notes
instead.
This
made
my
writing
much
more
efficient
because
I
no
longer
had
to
rummage
through
a
novel
anytime
I
wanted
to
quote
something.
Instead,
I
simply
had
to
find
it
in
my
notes,
page
reference
and
all.
Reading
notes
worked
out
so
well
for
me
that
I
now
utilize
them
whenever
I
read
a
novel
on
which
I
plan
to
do
any
type
of
writing.
And
thus
my
saga
as
a
writer
thus
far
comes
to
its
completion.
There
are
so
many
ways
in
which
I
need
to
grow
as
a
writer,
and
I
fear
that
over
the
past
few
years
my
writing
itself
has
become
quite
boring,
despite
the
improvements
I
have
made
in
the
writing
process
itself
(such
as
the
use
of
free
writes,
reading
notes,
etc.).
Perhaps
I
should
force
myself
to
engage
in
more
creative
writing;
I
have
always
been
more
comfortable
writing
formal
essays
than
I
have
writing
in
alternative
modes.
I
was
definitely
more
creative
as
a
child
-
perhaps
we
all
were-
,
but
even
my
dreams
now
are
more
boring
than
they
once
were,
and
I
am
not
sure
that
I
would
know
how
to
begin
writing
creatively,
Moreover,
like
the
majority
of
my
generation,
I
suffer
from
grammar
illiteracy-improper
placement
of
commas,
poor
sentence
structure,
etc.
Although
I
am
sure
that
the
people
behind
the
current
trend
in
education,
which
seems
to
concentrate
almost
exclusively
on
content
while
ignoring
grammar,
have
only
the
best
intentions,
I
feel
that
my
peers
and
I
have
been
done
a
disservice
by
having
been
deprived
of
thoroughly
learning
the
fundamentals
of
our
language,
But
I
need
to
come
off
my
soapbox
and
conclude
this
narrative,
It
has
overall
been
an
exciting
twenty
years
spent
developing
more
proficient
communication
skills,
both
verbally
and
through
the
process
of
writing.
While
reflecting
on
my
journey
thus
far,
I
recognize
that
it
has
indeed
been
a
lengthy
one,
My
sincere
hope,
however,
is
that
by
the
end
of
my
lifetime,
what
I
have
described
in
these
pages
will
not
even
reach
the
midway
point
in
the
history
of
my
development
as
a
writer.
