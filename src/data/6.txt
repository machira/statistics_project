THE
LITTLE
ENGINE
THAT
COULD
by
W.
Jr.
August
21,
1995
I
have
had
to
work
very
hard
to
become
a
writer.
For
many
years
inner
desire
kept
me
going.
My
struggle
with
writing
began
with
the
belief
that
writing
was
an
enemy.
But
after
experiencing
that
writing
can
be
fun,
writing
became
an
ally.
Once
this
occurred,
my
writing
ability
flourished
and
soon
would
shine.
As
a
result,
my
improvement
in
writing
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
go
on
to
college
to
achieve
other
goals
that
I
have
always
wanted
to
achieve.
Eventually,
I
gained
much
respect
for
the
art
of
writing.
My
history
as
a
writer
began
a
little
backwards.
I
was
dyslexic
when
I
was
younger
(which
caused
me
to
spell
backwards),
but
this
did
not
discourage
me.
For,
I
found
that
this
problem
could
easily
be
corrected
with
a
trusty
mirror.
Soon
I
created
secret
messages
that
only
a
trusty
mirror
could
decode.
As
my
secret
messages
manifested,
the
disadvantage
of
dyslexia
manifested
into
my
own
written
language.
Thus,
my
interest
in
writing
began.
Yet,
I
quickly
found
out
that
most
people
did
not
carry
around
a
trusty
mirror.
So
I
discovered
the
traditional
written
language
in
time.
It
would
take
many
years
of
personal
motivation
and
teaching
to
discover
the
traditional
written
language
-
and
to
become
a
writer.
In
grade
school
this
motivation
began.
I
remember
having
The
Little
Engine
That
Could
read
to
me.
I
was
inspired
by
the
little
engine
overcoming
his
obstacle.
I
only
wished
the
little
engine
could
help
me
with
my
obstacle
in
Writing.
Writing
was
my
weakest
subject,
and
no
matter
how
hard
I
tried
I
would
always
receive
a
C
in
Writing
every
grade
period.
This
disappointed
me,
for
I
knew
that
I
had
the
ability
to
do
better.
So
I
decided
to
devote
myself
to
improving
in
Writing.
I
began
by
waging
war
on
Writing,
and
I
was
headed
in
the
right
direction.
For,
I
had
just
defeated
dyslexia.
Then
my
big
opportunity
came.
I
had
just
been
assigned
my
first
essay
in
fifth
grade.
I
decided
to
write
about
Steve
Carlton.
In
my
research
I
detected
that
many
books
described
how
great
Steve
Carlton
was
as
a
pitcher.
A
list
of
all
of
the
impressive
statistics
accredited
to
him
was
the
proof.
Yet,
I
decided
to
research
and
write
about
Steve
Carlton
the
man
-
not
the
ball
player.
I
wrote
about
how
he
struggled
when
he
was
younger
and
had
to
work
hard
for
everything.
I
also
found
interesting
pieces
of
information
for
my
essay.
For
example,
Steve
Carlton
lifted
weights
which
caused
wear
and
tear
on
his
arms.
This
ended
up
shortening
his
career.
What
was
even
more
interesting
though,
was
that
I
received
a
B
on
my
essay!
This
was
the
best
that
I
had
ever
done
on
a
writing
assignment.
I
still
received
a
C
that
grade
period
though.
The
C
was
evidence
that
I
was
not
winning
the
war,
but
I
did
win
a
battle.
For,
I
proved
to
myself
that
I
have
the
potential
to
do
better.
This
realization
sparked
my
unwillingness
to
surrender
the
war.
So
the
war
on
Writing
continued.
And
like
a
constant
shelling,
I
continued
to
receive
a
C
every
grade
period.
The
good
news
from
this
was
that
at
least
I
was
holding
my
ground.
I
was
not
about
to
cede
any
ground
either.
I
had
the
audacity
to
overcome
this
war
of
attrition.
My
progress
was
slower
than
a
snail's
though.
There
was
little
improvement
for
me
in
grade
school
and
middle
school.
No
real
dramatic
improvement
began
until
high
school.
High
school
was
an
awakening
for
me.
For
the
first
time
I
was
actually
being
challenged
to
write.
As
a
freshman,
I
had
to
write
research
papers
(reports)
every
week
instead
of
every
blue
moon.
Also,
exams
required
written
responses
-
there
was
no
multiple
choice.
Although
it
seemed
agonizing
at
the
time,
this
enabled
me
to
come
to
perceive
writing
as
an
ally
instead
of
an
enemy.
Once
I
recognized
that
writing
could
be
an
ally,
my
writing
began
to
blossom.
I
finally
began
to
make
arguments,
and
my
reports
began
to
sound
like
reports
instead
of
encyclopedias.
With
the
help
of
my
freshman
English
class,
my
reports
began
to
look
like
reports
as
well.
Up
until
high
school,
anything
that
I
had
written
was
just
one
long
paragraph.
But
now
my
reports
had
some
form
-
the
addition
of
an
introduction
and
conclusion
in
particular.
As
a
result,
writing
and
I
agreed
to
end
our
war
and
sign
a
peace
treaty.
This
enabled
improvements
to
begin.
My
sophomore
year
offered
a
change
of
pace.
Writing
became
more
exciting
due
to
my
Oral
Communications
class.
This
class
involved
presenting
many
speeches.
These
speeches
were
like
acting
out
research
papers.
The
class
breathed
life
into
writing,
and
showed
me
that
writing
is
more
than
a
page
full
of
words.
In
this
class
I
also
learned
the
importance
of
an
attention
getter.
For,
the
success
of
a
speech
relies
on
an
opening
that
catches
the
attention
of
the
audience
and
draws
them
in
to
what
you
have
to
say.
I
also
found
that
a
strong
conclusion
is
important
in
order
to
emphasize
the
point
that
one
is
trying
to
make.
Most
important,
this
class
taught
me
to
present
my
argument
in
an
efficient
manner.
Since
the
speeches
had
time
limits,
there
was
no
time
to
waste
on
anything
not
pertinent
to
the
argument.
In
short,
I
finally
began
to
consider
my
audience.
Once
I
began
to
do
this,
my
writing
became
more
entertaining
and
others
began
to
take
interest.
Mrs.
Johnson,
my
Oral
Communications
teacher,
was
one
of
them.
She
was
quickly
becoming
an
influential
person
in
my
life
(and
later
became
a
good
friend).
For,
she
is
really
where
my
history
as
a
writer
begins.
In
my
junior
year
Mrs.
Johnson
began
to
teach
my
English
class
and
I
the
skills
it
takes
to
be
a
writer.
In
order
to
do
so,
she
had
my
class
write
commentaries
on
poems
everyday.
She
taught
us
to
identify
techniques
used
in
poems
like:
extended
metaphors,
understatement,
satire,
diction,
similes,
and
syntax.
I
found
how
impacting
a
period
can
be
as
well
as
the
absence
of
one.
I
started
to
write
more
and
more
on
my
own
as
a
result,
especially
poetry.
Mrs.
Johnson
was
also
very
hard
on
making
sure
that
my
class
focused
and
validated
an
argument
with
thorough
explanation
of
parts
of
the
poem.
I
also
found
that
tone,
purpose,
and
viewpoint
are
important
factors
in
presenting
an
argument.
Along
with
commentaries,
I
had
writing
projects
on
various
literary
works
(such
as
Things
Fall
Apart,
I
Know
Why
The
Caged
Bird
Sings.
Oedipus
Rex.
Hamlet,
and
The
Metamorphosis).
I
had
to
write
and
write
until
it
felt
like
my
hand
was
going
to
fall
off.
What
was
taking
place
though,
was
that
I
was
refining
my
writing
skills.
I
was
learning
to
go
in
depth
and
give
details.
I
was
also
learning
to
make
smooth
transitions
from
one
paragraph
to
another.
I
was
practicing
the
skills
it
takes
to
make
a
paper
shine.
Yet,
I
was
missing
a
valuable
skill.
After
taking
a
summer
Philosophy
course
at
Centre
College,
I
fully
grasped
this
skill.
This
was
the
importance
of
examining
things
from
all
sides.
In
this
course
questions
always
surfaced.
It
was
as
if
the
class
spoke
in
questions.
This
made
me
think
about
stating
what
I
had
to
say
and
how
others
might
react.
The
questions
that
were
raised
enabled
me
to
see
things
from
different
angles.
As
a
result,
I
could
now
find
strengths
and
weaknesses
in
arguments
in
order
to
construct
better
arguments.
Extensive
revision
was
now
becoming
a
part
of
my
writing
process.
Finally,
at
the
beginning
of
my
senior
year
I
found
out
how
much
I
improved
with
my
writing.
This
feedback
came
in
the
form
of
a
competition
known
as
the
Golden
Galaxy
Awards.
This
is
a
tri-state
competition
(anyone
residing
in
Kentucky,
Ohio,
or
Indiana
is
able
to
compete)
in
various
subjects.
The
subject
that
I
decided
to
compete
in
was
English.
My
requirements
for
competition
were:
letters
of
recommendation
from
three
of
my
teachers;
five
pieces
of
my
writing;
an
application
form
that
included
an
essay
on
how
English
has
impacted
my
life;
and
an
interview
by
the
panel
of
judges.
Then,
after
all
of
the
participants
had
been
interviewed,
on
the
night
of
October
20th,
1993,
I
was
named
the
Golden
Galaxy
Award
Winner
in
English.
I
was
overcome
with
emotion
that
night,
and
all
I
could
think
was
that
all
that
hard
work
was
paying
off.
I
soon
found
that
it
paid
off
in
more
ways
than
one.
For,
I
received
five
hundred
dollars
and
had
a
star
in
the
galaxy
named
after
me.
With
the
help
of
Mrs.
Johnson
and
my
star,
my
writing
really
began
to
shine.
My
improvement
in
writing
did
not
stop
though.
The
remainder
of
my
senior
year
I
had
to
complete
many
research
papers.
I
became
proficient
in
presenting
arguments
and
supporting
them
with
various
sources.
This
was
just
to
warm
me
up
for
the
ultimate
test,
a
four
thousand
word
extended
essay.
Being
well
prepared,
I
passed
the
test.
I
completed
my
essay
which
focused
on
the
influence
of
Jesse
Owens
on
the
Civil
Rights
Movement
(which
many
books
forget
to
mention).
After
completing
my
extended
essay,
I
knew
that
there
was
no
writing
obstacle
that
I
could
not
handle.
This
was
confirmed
during
my
first
year
at
Lafayette
College.
I
had
no
problems
with
any
writing
assignment.
Like
The
Little
Engine
That
Could,
dedication
and
hard
work
allowed
me
to
overcome
Writing
and
become
a
writer.
Yet,
I
still
continue
to
strive
to
improve
my
writing
ability.
For
no
matter
how
good
I
think
I
am,
I
think
I
can...
I
think
I
can...
always
be
a
more
proficient
writer.
I
just
have
to
want
it;
and
becoming
a
better
writer
is
something
that
I
have
always
wanted.
