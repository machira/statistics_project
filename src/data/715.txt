DonOt
Forget
the
Reader
There
is
more
to
being
a
WA
than
the
ability
to
produce
a
quality
piece
of
writing
D
the
ability
to
understand
the
writing
process,
to
identify
weaknesses
in
a
written
piece,
to
translate
those
weaknesses
to
gaps
in
the
writing
process,
and
to
vocalize
solutions
to
those
gaps
to
someone
with
a
writing
history
unique
from
your
own.
While
I
understood
this
upon
first
joining
the
College
Writing
Program,
I
had
not
learned
how
to
maximize
these
skills
and
apply
them
to
my
own
work.
Exercising
this
process
with
other
writers
has
taught
me
to
step
outside
of
my
own
writing.
More
than
Otaking
a
step
backO
from
a
piece
while
editing,
for
me,
stepping
outside
of
your
own
writing
involves
re-evaluating
your
purpose
and
the
extent
that
your
style
enhances
the
achievement
of
that
purpose.
My
work
as
a
WA
has
reminded
me
that
the
rhetoric
of
a
piece
is
there
to
carry
the
message,
and
not
vice
versa
D
this
is
a
mantra
I
must
carry
with
me
when
I
step
outside
of
my
writing.
As
will
I
will
likely
exhibit
in
the
words
to
follow,
living
this
mantra
is
not
always
easy
for
me,
for
example,
when
I
fall
in
love
with
a
sentence,
only
to
realize
it
has
no
purpose.
For
me,
editing
used
to
mean
taking
a
step
back
from
my
work,
looking
at
it
with
a
critical
eye,
but
tweaking
to
cater
to
myself,
more
than
to
the
reader.
I
always
knew
what
I
as
the
writer
wanted
a
final
piece
to
look
like,
and
my
editing
process
would
consist
of
a
series
of
changes
to
make
the
words
fall
the
way
I
envisioned
D
the
paper
was
only
malleable
within
the
bounds
of
what
I,
as
the
writer,
saw
as
its
potential.
My
work
with
the
College
Writing
Program,
and
interactions
with
a
variety
of
writers,
has
helped
me
to
take
my
editing
another
step,
to
move
outside
my
writing;
to
cater
to
the
reader
by
channeling
my
interpretation
of
the
purpose.
When
one
wants
his
or
her
message
to
be
effective
and
powerful,
there
is
no
room
for
a
self-interested
writer;
an
artist
only
invested
in
his
or
her
work
as
a
product
of
his
or
her
individual
creativity.
This
means
that,
although
a
writer
may
be
able
to
write
aesthetically
pleasing
prose,
this
prose
has
no
place
in
a
piece
of
writing
if
it
does
not
contribute
to
the
readerOs
understanding
in
some
way.
This
personal
realization
resonates
with
the
NWriters
vs.
Readers
ProseO
reading
done
in
class.
While
it
can
be
very
easy
to
identify
writer-based
prose
due
to
lack
of
experience,
as
in
the
use
of
an
ambiguous
pronoun,
even
experienced,
Ohigher
caliberO
writers
can
pose
their
own
obstacle
to
effective,
reader-based
work.
When
this
happens,
the
writer
probably
knows
that
there
is
a
clear,
direct
path
to
reach
the
reader,
but
may
get
caught
up
in
the
enjoyment
of
elaboration
and
the
fluency
by
which
style
comes
to
the
paper.
This
leads
to
some
unnecessary
detours
that
probably
do
not
benefit
the
audience,
and
may
in
fact
be
obstacles
to
understanding.
It
can
be
hard
to
grasp
how
the
reader
feels
on
the
other
end,
especially
when
you
have
so
painstakingly
crafted
a
sentence
that,
in
your
mind,
is
a
lovely,
aesthetically
pleasing
stain-glassed
window
to
your
ideas.
Much
like
the
less
experienced
writer,
the
dilemma
of
the
experienced
writer
is
due
to
lack
of
consideration
of
a
readerOs
unique
perspective.
One
of
the
fascinating
aspects
of
writing
is
that
no
one
ever
has
the
exact
same
perspective
D
take
two
writers
with
identical
credentials,
and
even
seemingly
identical
backgrounds,
and
ask
them
to
prove
the
same
thesis,
and
the
papers
are
still
likely
to
be
strikingly
different.
Every
person
that
has
ever
put
pen
to
paper,
fingers
to
keyboard,
has
put
himself
or
herself
in
an
interesting
dilemma,
because
behind
every
piece
of
writing,
the
writer
stands
alone.
People
may
possess
similar
ideas,
and
the
writer
may
even
be
writing
to
represent
a
larger
group,
but
the
person
with
the
power
to
place
and
arrange
and
re-arrange
the
words
on
a
page
has
a
unique
perspective.
The
words
and
ideas
for
which
they
are
accountable
are
intrinsically
mirror
images
of
each
other;
the
writerOs
mind
sees
the
page,
and
sees
his
or
her
ideas
looking
back
in
the
form
of
neat,
black
type.
However,
when
the
reader
looks
at
the
very
same
neat,
black
type,
he
or
she
may
see
an
impression
of
the
writerOs
ideas
D
if
they
are
looking
at
writer-based
prose,
they
may
see
a
fossil,
but
not
the
whole
structure,
and
they
have
no
idea
how
that
fragment
got
to
be
in
its
place
on
the
page.
Fragmented
ideas
embedded
in
a
piece
of
writing
are
one
way
that
writer-based
prose
manifests
itself,
especially
for
an
inexperienced
writer,
or
someone
who
is
extremely
knowledgeable
in
the
relevant
topic.
These
writers
may
forget
to
give
their
readers
the
tools
necessary
to
put
the
fragmented
fossils
together
into
a
likeliness
of
the
original
idea.
Other
writers
may
include
the
necessary
connections,
yet
over-embellish
so
as
to
complicate
the
readerOs
route
to
understanding.
I,
personally,
have
had
to
learn
that
the
longer
I
take
to
make
a
point,
no
matter
how
carefully
my
argument
is
mapped
out,
the
more
likely
the
readers
will
lose
sight
of
the
connections.
Instead,
they
are
left
with
a
heap
of
well
written,
pleasant
sounding,
purposeless
sentences,
which
actually
prevent
the
well-written,
meaningful
sentences
from
doing
their
job.
Of
course,
style
is
important
in
writing
D
without
it,
a
piece
may
have
substance,
but
lack
momentum.
However,
it
is
far
too
easy
for
one
to
get
overly
attached
to
his
or
her
style,
a
problem
that
is
evident
in
all
levels
of
writing.
There
is
a
time
and
place
for
style;
even
the
lack
of
rhetoric
is
in
itself
a
style
that
can
be
very
effective.
From
participation
in
staff
meetings
and
conferences
with
fellow
students,
I
have
found
myself
relearning
a
basic
principle
that
I
was
taught
when
I
first
learned
to
write
-
the
straightforward,
logical
expression
of
ideas.
Although
the
concepts
we
write
about
grow
more
complex
as
we
mature,
the
execution
of
these
concepts
can
still
follow
the
basic
steps
of
our
earliest
writing.
For
me,
the
challenge
is
to
not
let
my
mind
get
in
the
way
of
its
own
product.
The
tension
between
the
stylistic
versus
rational
building
of
an
argument
often
results
in
a
mental
race
of
which
can
get
on
the
page
faster.
As
I
have
learned,
sometimes
style
needs
to
take
a
backseat
to
reason.
Meet
Student
A,
a
science
major
in
his
first
year,
an
international
student
from
China.
The
first
paper
he
wrote
was
the
one
that
got
him
here
-
his
Lafayette
admissions
essay.
He
has
a
solid
foundation
for
being
a
great
writer
D
his
papers
move
logically
forward
and
are
easy
to
follow.
It
is
very
apparent
that
he
has
a
clear
direction
in
mind
before
he
actually
puts
words
on
paper.
He
understands
the
important
of
purpose,
as
seen
in
the
beginning
of
each
paper,
when
he
blatantly
states
the
purpose
of
the
words
to
follow.
He
makes
connections
for
his
audience
and
guides
them
along
his
roadmap
of
ideas
to
a
clearly
stated
conclusion.
His
papers
read
like
a
well-designed
blueprint,
but
stop
short
of
aesthetic
appeal,
providing
the
reader
with
not
much
more
than
a
skeleton
of
well
oiled,
strongly
connected
ideas.
As
a
WA,
this
student
posed
a
challenge.
His
ideas
were
not
only
neatly
packed
but
refreshingly
complex,
without
being
convoluted
or
contrived.
Sure,
they
read
like
a
lab
report,
with
overtly
stated
purposes
and
conclusions,
but
I
was
still
interested
in
what
he
had
to
say.
I
knew
that
he
was
coming
from
a
unique
position
as
a
student,
and
his
bare
bones
writing
most
likely
has
a
lot
to
do
with
cultural
differences
and
lack
of
writing
experience.
Still,
he
almost
flawlessly
addressed
the
prompts,
and
I
was
very
nervous
that
I
was
trying
to
fix
something
that
was
not
broken.
There
was
very
little
wrong
with
his
writing
D
where
do
you
draw
the
line
between
a
minimalist
style
and
a
complete
lack
of
voice,
which
could
pose
a
problem
depending
on
purpose
and
audience?
I
proceeded
with
caution,
sure
to
be
clear
on
what
he
was
doing
exceptionally
well,
adding
that
that
there
was
room
for
change,
if
he
wanted
to
practice
having
a
conversation
with
the
reader.
By
the
end
of
the
semester,
his
introductions
and
conclusions
had
more
universal
appeal,
more
of
a
human
voice.
His
writing
was
still
quick
and
straight
forward,
but
some
people
just
think
in
straight
lines.
Consequently,
as
he
continues
writing
and
continues
to
discover
his
voice,
it
may
be
distinctively
based
on
and
guided
by
reason.
As
I
continue
to
practice
not
letting
style
domineer
the
reason
of
a
paper,
his
reason
will
gradually
allow
more
and
more
style
to
shine
through.
Meet
Student
B.
On
the
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum
of
purpose
and
rhetoric,
it
is
evident
from
his
work
that
he
does
not
always
have
a
clear
idea
of
what
his
paper
will
say,
but
is
more
focused
on
how
he
wants
them
to
say
it.
This
writer
was
not
short
of
confidence
in
his
writing
ability.
While
he
often
chose
the
right
words,
he
had
a
propensity
for
choosing
them
at
the
wrong
moment,
when
they
did
not
move
the
piece
forward,
but
instead
disrupted
its
flow
to
a
static
drip.
My
writing
tends
to
be
off
balance,
leaning
towards
Student
BOs
end
of
the
spectrum.
This
is
part
of
the
reason
I
can
be
a
slow
writer
D
as
I
write,
I
obsessively
tweak
my
words
line
by
line,
in
order
to
achieve
the
perfect
rhythm
and
effect.
This,
of
course,
does
not
do
much
as
far
as
getting
my
ideas
on
paper.
The
same
way
a
floating,
stylized
sentence
might
get
in
the
way
of
the
readerOs
understanding,
my
inclination
to
stylize
my
writing
encumbers
on
my
writing
process.
Feeling
I
was
no
stranger
to
Student
BOs
dilemma,
I
did
not
think
that
guiding
him
to
have
more
clear
direction
in
his
papers
would
be
a
very
difficult
task.
I
tried
to
facilitate
him
to
draw
clear
connections
between
seedlings
of
separate
ideas
that
I
thought
could
be
reconciled.
I
wanted
him
to
focus
the
thought
and
energy
he
put
into
his
style
on
developing
a
more
complex
idea,
and
giving
more
logical
substance
to
his
words.
When
posed
with
these
questions,
he
was
able
to
develop
a
clearer
paper,
however
was
reluctant
to
critique
certain
places
that
were
not
well
tied
to
reason.
In
his
mind,
those
sentences
served
a
crucial
purpose,
although
one
that
was
not
readily
apparent
to
the
reader
D
he
had
not
yet
learned
to
step
outside
his
own
writing.
However,
Student
B
lacked
the
self-awareness
that
I
had
come
to,
much
through
my
work
with
the
CWP.
Reading
papers
with
so
many
different
voices,
and
hearing
the
thoughts
of
a
handful
of
other
WAs
with
their
own
unique
histories
in
writing,
provided
me
with
numerous
new
and
useful
perspectives
with
which
to
view
my
own
work.
Whether
looking
at
othersO
writing
as
a
point
of
comparison,
or
reflecting
on
past
staff
discussions
and
realizing
that,
despite
the
basic
examples
used
in
articles,
the
very
same
problems
could
be
found
in
my
own
writing
as
well.
As
every
writer
has
a
unique
point
of
view,
every
writer
is
capable
of
producing
his
or
her
own
version
of
writer-based
prose;
the
goal
is
to
overcome
the
instinct
to
create
within
your
own
mind,
no
matter
how
well,
and
accepting
the
task
of
writing
as
a
bridge
between
your
mind
and
the
readersO.
In
this
sense,
working
with
the
CWP
has
been
a
valuable
refresher
in
the
writer-reader
relationship,
one
that
is
constantly
changing,
but
of
which
the
initial
responsibility
falls
on
the
writerOs
shoulders.
As
writers,
we
may
ask
our
readers
to
have
open
minds;
it
is
only
fair
that
we
make
an
active
effort
to
provide
the
reader
with
a
direct,
fluent
argument,
even
if
this
means
recognizing
when
our
own
desire
for
creative
and
flowery
prose
hinders,
rather
than
enhances,
the
readerOs
interest.
