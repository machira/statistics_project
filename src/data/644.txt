Creativity
and
Writing:
My
Journey
to
Have
My
Voice
(or
Words)
Heard
Throughout
my
years
as
a
writer,
I
have
evolved
from
being
naFu
e
and
misguided
to
knowledgeable
and
concise.
I
have
struggled
tremendously
to
learn
not
only
proper,
but
effective
writing
techniques.
My
story
as
a
writer
is
an
epic
journey
that
ends
well.
My
story
is
a
quest
to
have
my
voice
(or
words)
heard
through
writing.
The
first
writing
assignment
that
I
can
recall
brings
me
back
to
the
third
grade
when
I
had
my
first
book
report.
The
assignment
was
simple
and
very
straight-forward:
summarize
a
book.
To
make
matters
even
more
basic,
the
teacher
gave
us
a
list
of
guideline
questions
to
follow.
When
I
got
home
that
afternoon,
I
took
a
quick
look
at
the
dozen
or
so
questions
and,
with
an
enthusiastic
smile,
rushed
to
my
computer
to
begin
my
book
report.
Fifteen
minutes
later
I
was
done.
I
printed
out
my
masterpiece
and
ran
to
show
my
father
what
I
had
produced.
After
scrutinizing
my
work
for
a
few
moments,
he
chuckled
and
said
methis
is
a
nice
outline.mo
Bewildered
and
discouraged,
I
learned
that
one-word
answers
like
meyesmo
in
response
to
medid
you
like
this
book?mo
did
not
suffice.
He
taught
me
that
I
needed
to
add
detail,
structure
and
precision
and,
most
importantly,
to
revolve
my
paper
around
a
central
question
or
problem.
Although
the
advice
seemed
fairly
clear-cut
and
easy
to
execute
at
the
time,
it
proved
very
difficult
for
me
in
the
coming
years
to
find
a
strong
balance
and
effectively
implement
these
concepts.
As
I
progressed
in
school
I
tried
desperately
to
use
these
tactics
to
the
best
of
my
ability,
but
for
the
most
part
failed
to
do
so.
At
times
I
would
have
too
many
details
but
the
structure
would
be
discombobulated.
At
other
times
I
would
have
few
details
and
not
enough
precision.
I
was
lost
and
distraught;
so
much
so
that
my
middle
school
years
were
defined
by
writing
tutors,
extra-curricular
writing
help
courses
and
verbal
beat-downs
from
my
parents.
It
was
the
dark
point
in
my
life
as
a
writer
and
I
let
it
be
known
that
I
unequivocally
abhorred
writing.
I
thought
of
writing
as
a
stringent
and
tedious
process
of
adhering
to
strict
guidelines
and
rules
with
no
room
for
any
creativity.
Soon
I
would
discover,
however,
how
wrong
I
truly
was.
Up
to
this
point,
during
my
elementary
and
middle
school
years,
I
predominately
wrote
summaries
of
books,
articles
and
essays.
Thesis
statements
were
either
non-existent
or
written
up
by
teachers
and
handed
to
us.
Assignments
were
repetitive
and
stale
and
we
had
little
or
no
opportunity
to
choose
an
assignment,
let
alone
a
thesis
statement.
High
school
would
be
my
turning
point
as
a
writer.
I
would
learn
that
an
essay
is
not
a
summary
of
someone
elseyus
writing
but
a
work
of
my
own.
It
was
my
opportunity
as
a
young
scholar
to
contribute
novel
concepts
to
our
growing
world
of
academia.
Two
points
in
my
high
school
career
epitomize
this
turning-point
in
my
life.
This
turning
point
begins
the
first
day
of
high
school.
I
walked
into
my
first
class
(an
English
class)
a
nervous
wreck.
I
remember
myself
shaking
as
I
took
out
a
notebook
ready
to
take
down
notes
as
fast
as
my
hand
could
write.
I
remember
asking
myself
a
myriad
of
questions
serving
to
guess
the
appearance
and
persona
of
the
teacher,
which
just
made
me
even
more
nervous.
Suddenly,
like
a
bullet
out
of
a
gun,
a
jubilant
young
man
bursts
through
the
door.
After
introducing
himself,
Mr.
Evans
happily
admitted
that
he
was
mea
little
eccentricmo
which
was
music
to
my
ears.
Until
this
point,
my
English
teachers
have
all
been
monotonous
and
didactic
feeding
me
similar
assignments
year
after
year.
I
saw
now
that
I
was
in
for
a
much
needed
change.
meYour
first

of

short
story,mo
as
he
held
up
a

Just
as
enthusiastic
as
my
third
grade
self,
I
rushed
home
after
school
to
begin
work
on
my
first
ever
creative
writing
assignment.
Finally
I
would
be
able
to
put
in
my
own
ideas
and
not
simply
translate
those
of
another
author
in
a
summary.
As
I
sat
at
my
computer
pounding
away
at
the
keyboard,
I
stopped
for
a
moment
in
disbelief,
meam
I
actually
enjoying
writing?mo
I
asked
myself
smiling.
That
year
in
my
9th
grade
English
class
we
did
not
write
one
research
paper,
analytical
essay
or
summarymucreative
writing
was
the
central
focus
of
the
class.
In
fact,
my
final
paper
for
that
class
was
to
write
a
letter
to
Shakespeare
in
Elizabethan-era
English
critiquing
his
play
A
Midsummer
Nightyus
Dream.
Mr.
Evans
ignited
a
strong
passion
inside
of
me
to
write
creatively
and
gave
me
an
unprecedented
writing
experience
that
proved
quite
beneficial
in
the
years
to
come.
My
writing
turning-point
becomes
even
more
profound
the
subsequent
year
of
high
school
in
my
World
History
class.
The
teacher
for
this
class
was
notorious
throughout
the
school
for
his
draconian
grading-style
and
arduous
assignments.
Admittedly
Mr.
Maguire
was
a
harsh
grader
and
he
did
deal
out
a
lot
of
assignments,
in
retrospect,
however,
I
have
to
contribute
almost
everything
I
know
about
research
papers
and
analytical
essays
to
him.
I
had
Mr.
Maguire
twice
in
my
high
school
career
and
I
wrote
a
grand
total
of
6
research
papers
and
a
countless
amount
of
analytical
essays.
He
truly
taught
me
the
differences
between
effective
and
ineffective
research,
how
to
formulate
a
powerful
thesis
(after
all,
according
to
his
philosophy,
if
one
did
not
present
a
captivating
and
argumentative
thesis
then
one
could
not
receive
a
grade
higher
than
a
meCmo
on
that
assignment)
and
how
to
provide
analysis
for
my
details
and
evidence.
Mr.
Maguireyus
assignments
molded
me
into
a
much
more
effective
writer.
He
helped
me
find
that
consistency
between
detail,
structure,
precision
and
succinctness.
Above
all,
however,
he
taught
me
to
not
only
write
a
clear
and
effective
thesis,
but
revolve
my
paper
around
it
too.
These
two
teachers
that
I
had
not
only
inspired
me
to
write,
but
gave
me
the
tools
to
do
so
effectively.
As
a
result
of
this
newfound
inspiration,
I
started
to
write
on
my
own
over
the
summers.
One
summer,
in
fact,
I
wrote
a
satirical
screenplay
on
how
passionate
people
get
watching
professional
sports.
In
addition,
this
past
summer
I
wrote
a
political
satire.
The
inspiration
that
I
felt
gave
me
an
idea
I
still
hold
close
to
my
heart:
mewhat
if
I
can
produce
writing
so
captivating
that
people
enjoy
reading
it?
Can
I
be
an
outstanding
author?
Can
I
have
my
voice
(or
words)
heard?mo
This
ignited
passion
continues
to
drive
me
today
to
write
to
the
best
of
my
ability
time
after
time.
The
passion
and
desire
to
write
well
was
certainly
now
there.
As
I
concluded
high
school,
however,
I
noticed
a
common
thread
of
comments
on
most
of
my
papers
throughout
the
year:
mework
on
grammar,mo
or
meawkward
sentence,
check
syntax.mo
This
was
obviously
disconcerting
especially
since
I
would
soon
be
writing
for
elite
professors
the
following
fall
at
Lafayette.
At
this
point
I
made
a
tremendous
decision:
spend
several
yearsyu
worth
of
my
savings
to
attend
a
summer
writing
course
at
Columbia
University.
What
I
took
away
from
this
course
far
exceeded
my
expectations.
By
taking
this
course
I
not
only
significantly
improved
my
grammar,
punctuation
and
syntax,
but
I
learned
how
to
make
my
writing
style
more
sophisticated
while
still
staying
concise.
I
also
picked
up
a
few
tricks
to
make
my
essays
more
attractive
and
academic
(e.g.
the
formula
to
create
my
title
of
this
paper:
one
or
two
words
to
generalize
my
paper
+
a
colon
+
five
to
seven
words
to
very
briefly
elaborate
on
those
one
or
two
generalizations).
To
further
polish
my
style,
one
of
the
required
readings
for
the
course
was
Strunk
and
Whiteyus
The
Elements
of
Style
which
I
still
keep
close.
After
taking
this
course,
I
felt
adequately
prepared
to
write
for
Lafayetteyus
eminent
faculty.
My
first
written
assignment
as
a
Lafayette
student
was
a
three-page
analysis
on
a
film
we
watched
in
class.
My
expectations
were
rather
high
for
this
assignment
and
I
was
understandably
nervous.
meHow
much
time
should
I
take
with
this
assignment?
Should
I
ask
others
to
read
it
and
give
me
feedback?
Should
I
go
to
the
professor
and
ask
him
to
read
through
it?mo
were
several
questions
that
ran
rampant
through
my
mind.
I
ended
up
leaving
myself
a
week
for
the
assignment
and
finished
in
two
days.
Although
I
vastly
over
anticipated
the
amount
of
work
I
would
have
to
put
in,
I
felt
good
that
I
left
myself
extra
time
and
I
learned
one
very
important
lesson
in
doing
somure-reading
papers
several
days
after
finishing
them
exposes
many
errors
initially
unseen.
I
ended
up
doing
very
well
on
the
assignment.
Later
on
that
semester,
however,
I
would
reach
a
high-point
as
a
writer
and
produce
my
best
work
yet.
In
my
FYS
class
I
had
a
final
assignment
requiring
us
to
read
two
autobiographical
accounts
on
the
air
war
in
Europe
during
the
Second
World
War.
Furthermore,
this
assignment
required
us
to
write
creatively
on
these
books
in
a
way
that
summarizes
them
and,
at
the
same
time,
draws
a
larger
conclusion
about
the
air
war
in
general.
Essentially
this
assignment
was
a
creative
writing
assignment
with
a
thesis
statement
that
we
needed
to
prove
with
examples
from
the
two
autobiographies
we
read.
As
I
wrote
more
and
more
of
the
assignment,
I
quickly
discovered
how
difficult
it
actually
was.
meA
creative
writing
assignment
with
a
thesis
statement?mo
I
thought
to
myself
in
confusion.
I
was
perplexed
and
did
not
know
how
I
would
approach
the
assignment.
I
decided
to
take
a
guess
and
organize
it
like
a
documentarymuaction
followed
by
narration.
I
opened
the
paper
up
with
an
action
scene,
more
specifically,
a
description
of
a
piloting
mission
hours
before
the
invasion
of
Normandy
in
1944.
Afterwards,
I
provided
a
paragraph
of
analysis
and
narration
in
italics.
When
I
showed
it
to
my
WA
he
told
me
that
no
one
else
in
the
class
had
done
the
paper
like
I
hadmuleaving
an
ambiguous
feeling
in
my
stomach.
I
started
to
question
my
approach
to
the
assignment
and
the
fact
that
my
paper
was
isolated
from
the
bunch.
On
the
other
hand,
I
felt
that
my
creative
passions
and
instincts
along
with
the
lessons
on
theses
statements
and
details
that
I
picked
up
over
the
years
helped
me
to
produce
a
brilliant
rendition
of
the
assignment.
In
the
end,
the
risk
paid
off.
When
I
had
the
assignment
returned
I
flipped
it
over
and
written
on
the
back
was
a
comment
I
will
never
forget:
meAdam,
you
have
a
gift
for
writing
creativelymudonyut
stop!mo
Since
that
point
I
have
not
stopped
writing
both
creatively
and
analytically
and
I
plan
to
continue
well
into
the
future.
Thinking
back
on
my
younger
days
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
I
held
such
distaste
for
writing.
I
see
now
that
writing
is
the
most
important
method
of
communication.
I
have
come
to
believe
that
if
one
writes
effectively
and
convincingly
then
one
can
accomplish
great
things.
It
is
because
of
this
conclusion
that
I
decided
to
pass
on
what
I
have
learned
over
the
years
to
others
and
become
a
WA.
I
want
people
to
feel
the
way
I
feel
about
writingmunot
being
a
tedious
process
but
being
an
opportunity
to
express
oneyus
opinions,
observations
or
research.
It
is
a
perfect
chance
to
have
oneyus
voice
heard
and
ideas
publicized.
It
took
me
a
while
to
learn
proper
writing
techniques
and
I
am
still
far
from
perfect.
Reading
the
works
of
professors
and
scholars
worldwide
further
illustrates
just
how
far
I
am
from
perfection.
During
high
school
I
developed
the
passion
and
tools
to
write
effectively.
During
my
course
at
Columbia,
I
polished
some
of
my
skills
and
learned
novel
concepts.
As
I
started
Lafayette
I
showed
what
I
am
capable
of,
but
that
is
only
a
small
start
on
a
long
journey
to
have
my
voice
(or
words)
heard
through
writing.
