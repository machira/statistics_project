Literacy
Narrative
Looking
over
the
past
year,
IOm
not
sure
that
I
have
a
concrete
answer
to
the
question
Nwhat
does
it
mean
to
write
as
a
Writing
Associate?O
Having
focused
more
on
the
College
Writing
ProgramOs
special
projects
during
the
past
two
semesters,
I
donOt
know
that
I
have
enough
experience
to
pinpoint
exactly
how
conferences
and
interacting
with
other
studentsO
writing
have
influenced
the
way
I
approach
my
own
assignments.
Rereading
my
first
literacy
narrative,
however,
I
do
realize
how
this
yearOs
experiences
have
changed
my
understanding
of
Nthe
writing
process,O
as
well
as
my
understanding
of
the
vast
differences
that
exist
amongst
individual
writers
and
their
own
processes.
One
discussion
that
stands
out
from
my
first
narrative
is
the
mention
of
academic
writing
and
how,
until
quite
recently,
I
have
considered
my
writing
process
to
be
rigid
and
formulaic.
I
tackle
writing
assignments
as
one
might
approach
a
math
problem.
My
formula
is
simple:
introduce,
create
a
thesis,
analyze,
quote,
analyze,
expand,
conclude.
Though
satisfactory
for
my
purposes,
this
formula
breaks
many
of
the
conventional
rules
of
process
writing.
For
example,
I
do
not
brainstorm
in
the
formal
sense;
I
do
not
sit
down
and
list
the
possible
ways
of
approaching
the
assignment,
nor
do
I
create
an
outline
or
draft
guidelines
to
follow
while
completing
the
project.
I
just
write,
and
I
worry
about
the
details
later.
Though
unconventional,
until
recently
this
formula
always
worked
for
me.
However,
last
semester
I
received
a
comment
from
an
English
professor
that
my
papers,
though
ambitious,
were
too
scattered
and
unfocused.
For
the
first
time
in
a
while,
my
NformulaO
had
failed.
All
of
the
introducing
and
quoting
and
analyzing
had
not
done
their
job.
So
I
broke
a
rule;
I
took
the
time
to
visit
that
professor
in
his
office,
and
I
sat
down
to
brainstorm
and
focus
my
thoughts.
That
same
semester
I
received
a
VaST
assignment
that
was
so
unbearably
long
that
I
did
the
unthinkable:
halfway
through
writing
the
paper,
I
created
an
outline,
and
I
made
notes
that
would
get
me
through
the
next
fifteen
pages
in
an
organized
manner.
Formulas
are
rigid;
they
are
absolute.
Thus,
if
I
was
forced
to
break
my
own
rules,
it
was
almost
certain
that
my
understanding
of
the
writing
process,
or
at
least
my
own
personal
process,
was
flawed.
A
single
approach
clearly
canOt
work
one
hundred
percent
of
the
time.
With
regard
to
conferencing
with
other
students,
if
my
own
traditional
approach
doesnOt
serve
me
without
fail,
then
it
is
almost
certain
that
this
approach
wonOt
always
be
sufficient
for
the
students
I
am
working
with.
That
is
why
it
is
so
important
to
help
them
find
their
own
technique.
Furthermore,
this
technique
cannot
be
set
in
stone;
it
needs
to
be
tailored
to
each
assignment
and
to
the
individualOs
concept
of
the
Nwriting
process.O
The
most
striking
writing-relating
experiences
that
occurred
this
past
year
are
all
connected
with
my
time
spent
helping
to
run
a
writing
workshop
at
the
Project
of
Easton
center.
After
having
helped
revamp
the
CWPOs
website
first
semester,
I
was
ready
to
move
onto
a
new
aspect
of
the
program.
I
became
familiar
with
Project
after
having
interviewed
one
of
the
WAs
assigned
to
the
job,
to
be
featured
in
a
spotlight
on
the
website.
From
the
moment
I
heard
about
it,
I
knew
that
Project
was
something
I
wanted
to
be
involved
in.
As
much
as
it
excited
me
to
be
able
to
help
students
connect
better
with
the
written
word,
I
found
it
infinitely
more
important
to
spend
my
time
helping
people
that
were
as
dedicated
as
the
members
of
Project.
The
WA
that
I
had
interviewed
about
Project
told
me
that
NYou
can
see
the
difference
between
working
with
members
of
Project
and
working
with
college
students.
When
you
compliment
someone
in
Project,
his
or
her
whole
face
lights
up.O
This
was
the
exact
moment
I
had
been
searching
for,
and
as
described
in
my
first
narrative,
it
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
that
I
aspired
to
be
a
Writing
Associate
for
the
college.
The
only
thing
IOve
ever
wanted
is
to
help
someone
else
fall
in
love
with
writing
the
way
that
I
have,
and
the
opportunity
to
work
with
Project
of
Easton
has
helped
move
me
toward
that
goal.
As
amazing
as
my
experience
with
Project
has
been,
it
has
also
been
one
of
the
most
difficult.
While
I
began
at
the
end
of
the
year
to
realize
how
tailored
each
individualOs
approach
to
writing
needs
to
be,
it
was
extremely
hard
to
move
from
the
realm
of
college
writing
to
the
style
of
writing
that
must
be
mastered
to
pass
the
GED.
Not
only
is
the
subject
matter
entirely
different,
but
the
level
of
confidence
and
familiarity
with
writing
among
the
members
of
Project
is
vastly
different
from
that
which
one
encounters
on
a
college
level.
It
was
hard
for
me
to
realize
that
those
elements
of
writing
that
come
instinctively
to
me
are
not
as
easily
understood
by
others,
if
they
are
understood
at
all.
Once
again,
I
had
to
learn
that
my
concept
of
writing
does
not
apply
to
every
individual,
nor
does
my
understanding
of
things
that
would
seem
commonplace,
such
as
the
English
language.
The
more
I
worked
at
Project,
the
more
I
realized
that
beyond
having
different
writing
techniques,
individuals
maintain
vastly
different
concerns
when
discussing
their
writing.
For
example,
when
I
meet
with
a
WA
to
go
over
my
own
work,
I
tend
to
care
less
about
positive
reinforcement
and
more
about
having
the
WA
point
out
those
areas
in
which
I
can
greatly
improve.
I
am
confident
enough
in
my
ability
as
a
writer
that
I
donOt
feel
the
need
to
linger
over
the
passages
that
I
have
done
right;
instead,
I
put
more
effort
into
the
passages
that
do
not
work
as
well
in
conveying
my
overall
message.
The
members
of
Project,
however,
depend
on
positive
reinforcement.
Some
need
to
know
that
their
organizational
skills
are
up
to
par;
others
need
to
know
that
they
have
successfully
mastered
the
vocabulary,
or
that
their
spelling
is
where
it
needs
to
be.
Regardless,
positive
reinforcement,
while
it
means
little
to
me,
is
invaluable
to
them.
Another
interesting
thing
that
Project
has
taught
me
about
my
own
work
is
how
strangely
uncomfortable
I
am
with
personal
writing.
The
members
of
Project
excel
at
this
kind
of
writing;
they
are
most
comfortable
when
the
GED
prompts
ask
them
about
their
personal
lives,
because
this
is
what
they
are
most
familiar
with.
Conversely,
I
cannot
stand
these
prompts.
I
find
it
much
easier
to
write
about
technological
advancements
or
the
salaries
of
professional
athletes
than
I
do
to
write
about
my
Nperfect
dayO
or
a
formative
event
from
my
childhood.
Despite
the
fact
that
we
thoroughly
brainstorm
each
prompt,
when
it
comes
time
to
write
the
essays,
I
always
find
myself
stuck.
When
I
write
on
a
personal
level
the
words
never
seem
to
come
out
right;
itOs
as
though
I
find
more
of
myself
in
pieces
with
an
academic
nature
than
I
do
in
the
pieces
that
are
focused
solely
on
me.
Even
this
narrative
doesnOt
seem
quite
right
to
me.
It
is
about
my
history
as
a
writer
over
the
past
year,
but
if
I
were
an
outsider
reading
it
IOm
not
sure
that
I
would
get
a
true
sense
of
how
I
have
evolved
and
how
helping
others
work
toward
their
goals
has
ultimately
helped
me
work
toward
mine.
Something
that
has
impressed
me
about
the
members
of
Project
is
how
open
they
are
to
sharing
their
experiences.
Not
only
do
they
prefer
personal
writing,
but
the
majority
of
them
are
not
shy
about
sharing
this
writing
when
they
are
finished.
They
are
proud
to
share
their
pieces,
because
these
pieces
are
evidence
of
their
accomplishments.
I
admire
this
openness.
When
I
think
of
my
accomplishments
in
the
field
of
writing,
I
focus
less
on
the
academic
and
more
on
the
creative;
my
poetry
is
the
most
important
thing
I
have.
Creative
writing
is
the
first
thing
I
mention
in
last
yearOs
literacy
narrative;
over
the
years,
my
passion
for
poetry
has
been
one
of
the
only
constants
in
my
literary
history.
Another
constant
has
been
the
fear
of
sharing
this
writing.
When
I
was
younger,
I
was
fearless;
I
would
hand
my
writing
to
anyone
who
could
spare
the
time
to
read
it.
As
I
grew
up,
however,
I
became
shy;
even
now
it
takes
a
lot
of
persuasion
to
convince
me
to
share
my
poetry
with
others.
You
can
imagine
the
difficulty
this
poses
since
I
am
president
of
an
open
mic
group
that
specializes
in
poetry
readings
in
the
front
room
of
GilbertOs
caf.
It
is
hard
to
convince
others
to
share
their
work
when
you
are
afraid
of
sharing
your
own
in
front
of
a
crowd
of
people.
The
openness
of
the
members
of
Project,
however,
has
inspired
me.
Near
the
close
of
my
work
as
an
Excel
scholar
this
summer,
I
shared
my
poetry
with
the
professor
I
have
been
doing
research
with.
I
was
afraid
that
the
work
I
have
put
so
much
of
myself
into,
my
most
personal
writing,
wouldnOt
be
enough
or
wouldnOt
get
the
message
across.
But
in
the
end,
that
is
the
way
only
way
you
get
better.
That
is
why
WAs
are
even
necessary,
because
talking
about
writing
is
the
only
way
to
move
a
NfinishedO
piece
forward.
Being
able
to
share
my
writing
with
this
professor,
as
well
as
the
research
I
undertook
during
the
summer,
showed
me
that
not
only
does
the
individual
writer
have
a
history,
but
so
does
that
individual
writerOs
body
of
work.
I
handed
my
professor
upwards
of
twenty
pieces,
all
different,
few
of
them
connected.
He
was
able,
however,
to
give
me
a
general
overview
of
my
own
work;
I
had
always
looked
at
my
poems
separately,
not
even
thinking
that
there
could
be
merit
in
viewing
them
all
together.
He
told
me
things
that
I
hadnOt
noticed
before.
Most
of
my
poetry
stems
from
storytelling;
they
all
start
as
parts
of
stories,
consolidated
into
poetic
form.
They
play
with
language,
experiment
with
new
words.
Most
importantly,
they
arenOt
autobiographical,
as
one
might
expect.
Few,
if
any,
can
truly
be
connected
to
my
life.
I
think
that
is
what
I
found
most
interesting
of
all
the
things
he
noticed;
I
always
thought
that
I
wrote
for
myself,
so
it
is
striking
that
none
of
my
poems
would
have
anything
to
do
with
my
life.
The
moment
he
pointed
that
out,
I
couldnOt
stop
thinking
of
something
that
Gertrude
Stein
once
said,
NI
write
for
myself
and
strangers.O
She
sums
it
up
beautifully;
I
write
because
I
canOt
not
write,
but
the
things
that
I
create
arenOt
really
about
me
at
all.
They
arenOt
even
about
my
friends
or
family.
They
are
created
for
people
I
donOt
know,
people
I
have
never
even
met.
It
is
safe
to
say
that
I
have
not
had
the
typical
WA
experience;
I
have
never
yet
had
a
college
class
to
work
with,
or
done
routine
rounds
of
conferences,
but
I
wouldnOt
change
that
for
anything.
Working
on
special
projects
has
shown
me
more
about
the
individualOs
writing
process
than
I
think
I
could
have
seen
working
alongside
a
single
class.
I
think
the
most
important
thing
any
new
WA
has
to
remember
is
that
writing
isnOt
stagnant.
It
changes
constantly.
If
we
can
find
it
necessary
to
break
our
own
rules,
even
after
years
of
practice,
then
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
how
varied
and
complex
othersO
rules
are,
and
how
each
assignment
is
a
chance
to
reinvent
oneOs
self
as
a
writer
and
oneOs
concept
of
the
writing
process.
