LITERACY
NARRATIVE
My
first
experience
as
a
writer
was
when
I
was
about
five
years
old.
Although
my
first
language
is
Spanish,
I
learned
how
to
write
in
English.
My
family
liad
moved
to
Tennessee
while
my
father
got
his
doctorate,
and
it
was
there
that
I
learned
how
to
write.
I
remember
the
thrill
of
learning
the
alphabet,
and
writing
my
full
name
for
the
first
time.
I
practiced
my
name
for
days
and
days
wherever
I
could.
Soon
after
that,
I
learned
to
write
my
address,^he
date,
the
city
where
I
lived,
and
so
forth.
After
that,
writing
as
a
process
became
a
very
routine
one,
though
it
was
still
exciting.
I
remember
the
fat
pencils
we
had
to
use,
and
Ijow
much
better
they
were
than
the
crayons
we
usually
used
for
drawing
and
scribbling.
I
also
remember
the
type
of
paper
we
wrote
on
--
it
was
spaced
widely
enough
for
children
learning
how
to
write,
and
it
had
a
grainy
texture
to
it.
When
I
took
my
first
spelling
assignment
home
to
my
family,
it
was
very
exciting.
After
that,
writing
exercises
became
longer
and
more
structured,
beginning
of
course,
with
the
first
grade.
Learning
how
to
structure
a
sentence
in
proper
gramatical
terms
was
perhaps
one
of
the
most
challenging
experiences
of
my
writing
career.
1
recall
having
drills
and
exercises
testing
our
abilities
as
good
sentence
writers.
Even
though
it
was
a
challenging
experience,
it
was
during
those
early
years
that
I
went
through
my
most
creative
phase
as
a
writer.
If
we
had
assignments,
I
can
remember
giving
a
great
amount
of
time
and
care
to
writing
the
most
creative
stories
possible.
I
used
to
write
ghost
stories,
animal
stories,
and
people
stories,
but
mv
favorite
was
writing
dinosaur
stories.
I
had
an
imaginary
character
(who's
name
I
couldn^t
remember
if
I
tried),
and
I
would
write
very
elaborate
stories
about
him
going
to
the
store,
going
on
trips,
etc.
My
stories
were
always
fully
illustrated,
and
they
were
usually
fplded
in
half
and
stapled
to
make
a
book.~Usually,
my
parents
were
the
proud
recipients
of
these
stories.
During
those
early
years,
my
teachers
usually
commended
me-on
my
creativeness,
although
every
once
in
a
while
I
would
get
into
trouble
because
of
not
paying
attention
in
class
while
writing
a
story.
As
I
got
older,-my
learning
experiences
with
writing
changed.
1
still
enjoyed
writing,
but
there
was
a
difference
in
my
approach
to
it.
I
remember
that
in
second
grade,
I
became
disillusioned
with
grammar
because
I
had
a
very
unenthusiastic
teacher.
Her
only
concern
was
that
we
do
the
assignments
correctly,
and
not
necesssarily
that
we
understand
wjxy"things
were
a
certain
way.
As
the
years
progressed,
my
writing
projects
became
longer
and
longer,
and
the
topics
themselves
more
complex.
One
of
the
worst
experiences
J
ean
remember
was
in
fifth
grade,
when
I
was
assigned
a
history
project
about
Florida.
The
way
the
project
was
presented
to
me
in
the
first
place,
was
unappealing
and
boring.
My
teacher
wasn't
exactly
the
most
enthusiastic
man
in
the
world
either.
I
began
working
on
the
project
very
late,
I
put
very
little
effort
into
it,
and
as
a
result,
mvjinal
project
was
not
very
good.
That
marked
the
beginning
of
a
long
career
of
procrastination,
which
sadly,
has
continued
until
today.
Starting
in
sixth
grade,
my
writing
experience
changed.
My
family
moved
back
to
Venezuela,
where
I
practically
had
to
learn
how
to
write
again.
Spanish
is
very
different
from
English
--
the
grammar
rules
are
entirely
different,
the
structure
is
different,
and
even
the
alphabet
is
a
little
bit
different.
The
first
few
homework
assignments
I
was
given
were
very
challenging,
and
I
even
remember
having
my
father
explain
some
of
the
grammatical
basics
to
me
in
order'
for
me
to
be
able
to
complete
the
assignments
However,
1
soon
got
the
hangj
of
the
language,
and
the
projects
became
easier
with
time.
One
interesting
aspect
about
writing
in
Spanish*
is
that
it
is
much
easier
than
English
for
me,
even
though
I
learned
how
to
write
in
English
first.
The
ideas
seem
to
flow
much
easier
when
I'm
writing
in
Spanish,
and
the
general
structure
of
my
papers
is
clearer.
As
I
went
from
grade
to
grade,
my
written
assignments
became
even
longer,
and
in
eighth
grade,
(
for
the
first
time),
I
was
required
to
prepare
a
critical
essay
of
a
novel.
Oddly
enough,
I
don't
have
too
many
memories
of
that
particular
essay,
and
I
can't
imagine
that
it
was
such
a
great
experience
for
me.
Entering
the
ninth
grade,
I
transferred
to
a
private
boarding
school
in
New
Jersey
(Blair
Academy).
This
proved
to
be
one
of
the
best
things
to
happen
in
my
writing
career.
My
English
teacher
that
year
was
wonderful
in
many
ways.
The
projects
he
assigned
were
all
very
creative,
and
he
really
emphasized
hard
work
on
them,
as
well
as
a
great
amount
of
thought.
This
soon
became
my
favorite
approach
to
writing.
It
was
also
at
this
time
that
I
had
to
use
a
computerlbrthe
first
time.
This
more
than
the
actual
writing
proved
to
be
a
very
traumatic
experience.
It
was
clear
from
the
start
that
computers
were
not
made
for
people
like
me
(or
vice-versa)!
Regardless,
I
plunged
into
all
of
my
writing
projects
with
as
much
enthusiasm
as
I
could
conjure
up.
My
papers
were
fun
and
creative,
and
the
praise
they
got
from
my
teacher
and
other
teachers
pushed
me
to
write
even
more.
During
my
time
at
Blair,
my
writing
talents
improved,
my
style
changed,
and
best
of
all,
I
received
a
strong
background
in
critical
essay
writing,
as
well
as
reflective
writing.
One
of
the
best
experiences
for
me
as
a
writer,
was
having
to
keep
a
journal
for
a
religion
class
I
took
there.
My
teacher
asked
us
to
keep
a
journal
documenting
just
about
anything
we
wanted
to.
The
only
requirement
was
that
it
had
to
be
longer
than
one
page,
and
it
had
to
discuss
more
than
just
what
we
did
that
day!
As
it
was,
I
enjoyed
writing
in
my
journal
tremendously.
My
entries
were
usually
about
four
to
five
pages
long,
and
they
covered
everything
from
religion,
war,
starvation,
my
family,
my
friends,
and
so
forth.
It
was
a
way
in
which
I
could
express
my
feelings,
as
well
as
practice
my
writing
skills.
Another
good
experience
in
high
school
was
being
placed
in
two
advanced
English
classes.
Both
of
them
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
explore
writing
in
many
different
forms.
I
was
required
to
prepare
critical
essays,
reaction
essays,
reflective
essays,
analytical
essays,
personal
narratives,
as
well
as
creative
essays.
Again,
the
assistance
and
praise
I
received
from
my
teachers
was
very
helpful.
One
of
my
fondest
memories
is
from
an
English
final
(believe
it
or
not),
in
which
we
had
to
write
a
script
for
an
imaginary
play
in
which
four
poets
(including
Thoreau
and
Wordsworth)
were
on
a
cruise
and
then
became
shipwrecked.
I
don't
remember
a
single
writing
experience
with
which
I've
had
so
much
fun.
They
practically
had
to
take
my
"exam"
away
from
me,
and
best
of
all,
I
got
an
"A"
on
it.
It
was
such
a
free
and
novel
experience
for
me,
and
sadly,
it
was
very
brjef
and
has
not
been
repeated
since
then.
When
I
arrived
at
Lafayette,
many
things
were
different.
Although
I
was
very
confident
in
my
writing
abilities,
I
soon
discovered
that
my
Professors
did
not
seem
to
think
the
same.
My
first
year
was
a
series
of
traumatic
papers,
all
nighters,
extensions,
etc.
(all
of
which
I'm
sure
nobody
else
has
gone
through,
right?).
My
second
year
was
much
better
in
terms
of
re-developing
a
style,
with
the
exception
of
two
Biology
papers
that
I
was
required
to
prepare.
I
had
never
written
a
scientific
paper,
and
soon
found
that
there's
an
entirely
different
set
of
rules
for
that
kind
of
paper.
Many
long
hours
were
spent
in
AHE
and
Skillman,
as
I
tried
to
figure
out
what
in
the
world
my
Professor
(who
in
my
mind
was
completely
insane)
was
expecting
of
me.
Luckily,
my
Professor
seemed
to
like
my
papers,
and
soon
enough,
his
class
was
over.
Other
than
that,
I
continued
the
cultivation
ofjny
paper
procrastination
and
"quick
recovery
of
the
wasted
time"
skills.
On
more
than
one
occasion,
I
began
a
paper
two,
maybe
three
nights
before
it
was
due,
and
sometimes
(ifthe
paper
was
short
enough),
the
night
before
it
was
due.
As
expected,
the
vast
majority
of
those
papers
were
not
even
worthy
of
handing
in,
and
yet
there
they
sit,
in
a
number
of
9ffices
throughout
the
campus.
Clearly,
the
negative
implications
of
working
in
that
fashion
took
their
toll
on
a
number
of
class
grades.
My
best
papers
were
the
ones
which
were
prepared
carefully,
well
in
advance,
and
reviewed
often.
As
my
Junior
year
progressed,
so
too
did
the
increasing
amount
of
pages
and
complex
topics
lhat
1
was
required
to
complete.
I
wrote
constantly,
and
once
again
began
spending
endless
nights
preparing
a
five,
ten,
fifteen
or
twenty
page
paper.
That
year
I
also
took
a
S^panish
literature
Seminar,
in
which
much
of
the
same
was
applied
to
my
writing.
Regardless,
as
my
classes
became
harder,
my
Professors
became
more
demanding.
Although
I
cannot
say
that
my
approach
to
starting
papers
has
improved
all
that
much,
I
can
say
that
my
own
style
and
the
ease
with
which
I
can
convey
ideas
has
improved
a
Jot.
As
a
graduating
Senior,
I
am
still
challenged
on
a
daily
basis.
Working
on
an
Honors
Thesis
(which
will
be
completed
this
semester),
I
still
find
myself
staying
up
until
all
hours^of
the
night,
struggling
with
difficult
concepts,
and
of
course,
fighting
with
the
computers
in
AHE
and
Skillman.
However,
I
have
learned
many
important
lessons.
I
now
begin
my
papers
much
further
in
advance,
as
well
as
taking
advantage
of
the
assistance
mv
Professors
and
WA's
can
give
me.
Even
so,
I
can't
deny
the
fact
that
like
any
college
student,
I
am
a
superb
procrastinator,
and
I
have
had
problems
with
my
papers
as
a
result.
Hopefully,
given
my
experience
writing
in
two
languages,
my
continuing
experience
with
long
and
complex
research
papers,
as
well
as
the
facility
with
which
I
can
develop
and
comprehend
certain
themes,
I
will
be
able
to
help
others
asaWA,
and
not
only
offer
format
and
grammar
suggestions,
but
wisdom
from
my
experiences
as
well.
