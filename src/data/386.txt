My
History
as
a
Writer
My
world
is
not
painted
with
colors;
it
is
hued
with
words.
These
ever-present
companions
drift
around
me,
striking
at
the
oddest
moments:
when
IOm
in
the
shower
trying
to
dye
my
hair
a
brazen
red,
when
IOm
at
work
stuffing
endless
envelopes,
and
even
when
I
am
blissfully
floating
in
the
world
of
dreams.
These
words
follow
me
everywhere
I
go.
They
have
been
stalking
me
for
as
long
as
I
can
remember.
From
the
day
I
opened
my
eyes
and
realized
that
there
was
a
world
around
me,
ripe
with
promise,
pregnant
with
experiences
just
waiting
to
be
had,
I
have
wanted
to
capture
it
on
paper.
From
poetry
to
fictitious
prose
to
reports
on
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
Karachi
stock
market
and
argumentative
essays
on
the
pros
and
cons
of
capital
punishment,
I
have
always
taken
an
intense
pleasure
in
the
enigmatic
process
of
writing.
It
started
with
an
eight-line
poem
titled
OMy
MotherO
in
second
grade,
where
I
liberally
extolled
the
virtues
of
the
best
mother
in
the
world,
who
made
great
lasagna
and
tied
my
shoelaces
and
packed
my
lunch
before
sending
me
off
to
school
and
decorated
my
hair
with
bright
pink
and
green
ribbons
every
morning.
The
poem
received
extravagant
praise
from
the
proud
momma
and
it
encouraged
my
six-year-old
mind
to
seek
avenues
unexplored
like
more
detailed
poems
with
titles
like
OMy
fatherO,
and
OMy
schoolO,
and
OMy
best
friendO.
I
treasured
these
poems,
written
on
wrinkled
scraps
of
four-lined
paper
in
my
clumsy,
childish
scrawl.
The
language
grew
more
sophisticated
over
time
and
the
topics
more
varied
but
the
pattern
did
not
change
up
until
I
came
to
college:
in
every
one
of
my
poems,
every
two
lines
ended
with
words
that
rhymed.
Poetry
was
a
pastime,
but
having
a
life
dominated
by
schoolwork
meant
English
language
classes
where
essay-writing
work
was
an
eventuality.
I
always
welcomed
writing
assignments
after
spending
weeks
poring
over
masculine
and
feminine
pronouns
and
tedious
spelling
rules.
It
was
a
pleasure
to
toss
away
those
dusty
books,
oozing
with
unnecessarily
long
explanations
about
how
ObutO
and
OputO
are
not
pronounced
the
same
way,
and
how
the
plural
of
OmouseO
is
OmiceO
but
the
plural
of
OhouseO
is
not
OhiceO.
Those
dreary
language
lessons
probably
helped
shape
me
into
the
kind
of
writer
I
am
today,
especially
since
English
is
my
second
language,
but
to
a
middle-schooler
who
just
wanted
to
sit
in
her
room
and
fill
journal
after
journal
about
how
the
cute
dimples
embellished
the
boyishly
handsome
face
of
the
boy-next-door
and
her
latest
trip
to
the
amusement
park
where
she
had
been
allowed
to
ride
the
dragon
coaster
twice,
they
seemed
akin
to
a
kind
of
medieval
torture.
We
were
blessed
with
essay
assignments
at
least
four
times
a
year,
two
as
midterms
and
finals,
and
two
as
previews
to
the
midterms
and
finals.
After
every
summer
vacation,
the
first
English
class
invariably
presented
the
same
challenge:
describe
in
two
hundred
words
or
more
how
you
spent
your
summer
vacation.
It
seemed
as
if
my
teachers
did
everything
in
their
power
to
ensure
that
my
passion
for
writing
be
metamorphosed
into
a
kind
of
drudgery;
no
better
than
having
to
take
the
garbage
out,
or
doing
the
dishes.
By
the
time
I
was
in
the
fifth
grade,
I
was
one
of
the
popular
writers
of
my
class.
Whenever
some
kind
of
in-class
writing
assignment
was
imposed
on
us,
my
classmates
flocked
to
my
pencil-stained
desk,
scrounging
for
ideas,
using
me
as
a
live
thesaurus,
and
even
falling
down
on
their
hands
and
knees,
bribing
me
to
write
their
assignments
for
them.
This
kind
of
attention
did
not
bother
me;
on
the
contrary,
it
made
me
feel
unabashedly
proud,
since
I
was
a
rather
shy,
nondescript
adolescent,
who
would
rather
be
poring
over
a
novel
instead
of
running
about
in
the
playground
on
her
stodgy,
unreliable
legs,
definitely
not
the
kind
of
kid
that
made
a
hit
with
the
bursting-with-energy,
almost
obnoxiously
socially
extroverted
girls
in
my
class.
I
won
my
first
descriptive
writing
competition
then.
It
was
an
inter-class
competition,
where
one
person
was
chosen
to
represent
each
class.
The
topic
given
posed
the
challenge
of
writing
about
a
wild
animal,
describing
the
way
we
picture
it
in
its
environment.
I
chose
a
lion.
My
English
teacher
was
pretty
confident
when
choosing
me
and
it
certainly
paid
off,
simultaneously
bringing
the
prize
to
our
class
and
boosting
my
assuredness
as
a
writer.
Encouraged
and
inspired
greatly
by
the
Nancy
Drew
books
that
I
was
voraciously
lapping
like
a
hungry
cat,
one
fine
day
I
hesitantly
ventured
upon
penning
a
short
story
of
my
own.
It
had
to
be
adventurous,
dramatic
and
finish
with
pizzazz.
So
I
dug
out
an
old
half-filled
Social
Studies
notebook
of
mine
and
set
about
on
the
task
with
diligence.
Slowly,
the
idea
took
shape
and
I
came
up
with
a
stunning
title:
OThe
Unstoppable
BulletO.
My
story
had
it
all:
a
tight
plot,
fistfights,
government
involvement,
and
of
course
a
hero
and
heroine.
Unfortunately,
the
story
never
panned
out;
dedicated
as
I
was,
I
was
still
eleven
years
old.
However,
it
laid
a
rich
groundwork
for
further
stories
and
fictional
pieces.
Besides
writing
for
school
and
penning
fiction
in
longhand,
I
have
always
been
an
avid
diary-keeper.
I
started
keeping
a
diary
early
on
in
life.
At
first,
it
started
as
a
daily
entry
describing
every
little
detail
of
how
every
day
went,
what
I
ate,
what
I
wore,
who
I
met,
where
I
went.
Even
the
smallest
detail
did
not
go
unnoticed
in
those
nightly
entries,
penned
in
blue
fountain
ink.
As
I
grew
older,
however,
the
context
of
those
journals
changed.
They
grew
more
philosophical,
more
emotional
and
thoughtful.
I
started
writing
about
my
feelings
and
my
reactions
to
different
situations
the
life
of
an
adolescent
pose.
I
filled
page
after
page
describing
the
first
flush
of
teen
love,
the
frequent
fallings-out
with
my
parents
and
how
I
wished
I
could
just
run
away
from
home
on
the
first
bus
heading
north.
Every
emotion
was
captured,
every
thought
accounted
for.
I
was
like
a
human
dynamo,
spending
hours
locked
up
in
my
room,
curled
up
on
my
bed,
letting
my
right
hand
guide
my
entire
life.
Writing
became
an
outlet,
my
journals
my
best
friends.
Meanwhile,
school
writing
started
becoming
more
sophisticated.
As
I
entered
my
OO
levels,
the
task
became
more
challenging
and
creative,
and
I
was
introduced
to
the
enigmatic
enterprise
of
writing
research
papers.
I
learned
how
to
gather
information
from
different
sources
and
compress
and
expand
it
into
thorough
bodies
of
writing.
I
discovered
the
Internet
and
it
soon
became
my
main
fount
of
information.
A
challenge
I
faced
was
handling
and
culling
the
massive
volume
of
information
that
my
computer
spewed
every
time
I
hit
Yahoo
search.
Most
of
the
research
writing
assignments
were
given
in
class
as
group
work,
and
I,
used
to
working
alone,
and
processing
my
thoughts
in
privacy,
found
that
a
little
hard
to
handle.
Whenever
I
was
assigned
a
group,
we
ended
up
distributing
the
work
like
a
bunch
of
kids
would
share
a
rainbow
Popsicle.
In
ninth
grade,
I
was
assigned
a
research
paper
on
Gandhi,
with
two
other
girls.
Their
ideas
on
splitting
the
work
annoyed
me
no
end;
one
would
do
his
early
life,
another
would
do
his
political
interests,
and
the
third
would
do
his
spiritual
quest.
I
was
assigned
his
political
interests
and
for
days,
I
was
totally
at
sea
as
to
how
I
was
expected
to
describe
his
political
activities
without
mentioning
what
in
his
early
life
spurred
him
to
start
walking
down
that
path,
and
how
his
political
ideas
were
affected
by
his
spiritual
conduct.
I
had
trouble
slicing
one
whole
writing
assignment
into
manageable
parts;
I
was
too
used
to
attacking
a
writing
assignment
as
one
whole
bull
to
tackle
instead
of
a
limb,
a
horn
and
a
torso.
English
classes
in
OO
levels
were
a
treat.
They
were
about
creative
writing,
descriptive
writing,
argumentation,
and
fictitious
writing.
I
always
preferred
to
write
descriptive
essays
but
my
English
teacher
slowly
coaxed
me
toward
argumentation,
and
soon
I
began
to
enjoy
arranging
my
writing
in
pros
and
cons.
I
learned
to
present
both
sides
on
controversial
issues
such
as
abortion,
honor
killings,
and
tax
reforms.
My
reading
habits
slowly
strayed
from
fanciful
romance
novels
to
the
front
pages
of
popular
national
newspapers.
I
began
to
formulate
definitive
opinions
and
these
glimmered
in
the
writing
I
did.
Taking
up
debate
in
eighth
grade
helped
strengthen
my
argumentative
writing
skills
even
further.
I
wrote
my
own
debates,
picking
up
quotes
from
different
sources,
citing
examples
of
real-life
events,
and
presenting
conclusions
in
a
concise,
yet
no-nonsense
manner.
In
those
days,
I
learned
to
tighten
my
pieces
of
work,
make
them
more
focused,
which
was
a
stark
contrast
to
my
writing
of
before,
which
tended
to
be
all-encompassing,
with
lots
of
portraiture,
drifting
from
topic
to
topic
but
no
clear
sense
of
direction.
My
teachers
taught
me
how
to
focus
my
pieces
more.
One
very
valuable
lesson
I
learned
from
my
ninth
grade
English
teacher
was
that
writing
to
clearly
defined
specifications
can
be
a
lot
easier
to
tackle
if
a
plan
was
made
first.
From
then
on,
I
started
to
respond
to
such
requirements
paragraph
by
paragraph.
I
started
with
a
topic
sentence
and
a
careful
arrangement
of
the
point
I
intended
to
make
in
each
paragraph.
In
the
beginning,
I
found
such
methods
to
be
stifling
for
my
runaway
creative
streak,
but
later
I
began
to
realize
the
effectiveness
of
it
for
academic
writing.
Meanwhile,
I
continued
to
have
a
secret
creative
life.
My
poems,
which
had
prior
been
about
the
beauty
of
the
olive
tree
in
my
backyard
and
about
my
feelings
for
the
latest
cricket
tournament
took
a
sudden
turn
into
erotica.
I
found
a
secret
delight
in
passionate,
sexually
explicit
poetry
and
prose.
It
was
during
that
time
that
I
started
a
series,
which
was
based
on
my
life
and
featured
all
my
friends.
I
named
in
OThe
CitizenOs
SchoolO
and
magnified
our
rather
ordinary
lives
into
a
plethora
of
adventuresome
events
and
mind-boggling
fun.
My
friends
could
not
possibly
get
enough.
In
real
life,
we
had
yet
to
go
on
our
first
dates
and
in
OThe
CitizenOs
SchoolO
we
were
proud,
ravishing
beauties,
walking
the
streets
and
going
to
all-night
parties
on
the
arms
of
the
guys
we
secretly
lusted
after.
It
was
no
surprise
that
my
friends
soon
turned
my
running
series
into
an
escape
from
reality,
and
those
red
journals,
filled
with
my
messy
scrawl
became
the
most
sought-after
items
in
our
friends
circle.
Everybody
wanted
a
taste.
For
me,
it
was
my
favorite
pastime,
since
I
could
fully
let
my
imagination
run
wild
and
bring
my
most
private
of
fantasies
to
life
on
paper.
I
was
encouraged
to
venture
into
formal
publication.
Even
my
parents,
who
were
delighted
that
there
was
a
budding
writer
in
the
family,
urged
me
to
give
some
sort
of
permanence
to
my
pieces
of
work,
send
them
to
youth
magazines
with
wide
readerships.
But
even
though
I
was
touched
at
their
faith
in
me,
something
always
held
me
back.
I
did
not
want
my
naked
emotions
cloned
into
identical
beings
and
spread
on
paper
to
be
read
by
strangers
to
whom
my
name
was
nothing
but
a
network
of
alphabets.
When
I
entered
into
Advanced
Levels,
I
got
my
best
present
ever:
a
Pentium
three
desktop
complete
with
a
color
printer.
For
the
first
time,
I
discovered
how
much
easier
writing
was
when
I
didnOt
have
to
stop
every
twenty
minutes
to
massage
my
knuckles.
I
didnOt
have
to
cross
put
mistakes;
I
could
merely
hit
OdeleteO.
It
was
a
heady
experience.
The
twenty-four
hour
Internet
connection
made
it
even
easier
since
the
online
thesaurus
was
just
a
click
away.
Using
a
computer
as
a
medium
instead
of
a
pen
made
my
writing
more
realistic
and
better
researched
since
I
no
longer
had
to
put
any
curiosity
and
questions
that
arose
in
the
process
on
my
Oto
do
listO.
I
merely
had
to
hit
Internet
explorer
and
explore
away.
For
my
advanced
level,
I
had
to
do
a
lot
of
papers
on
controversial
issues
such
as
euthanasia
and
honor
killings
in
third
world
nations.
The
Internet
did
not
just
give
me
a
barrage
of
information,
it
supplied
plentiful
real
life
examples
and
opinions
from
the
worldOs
experts.
I
owe
my
distinction
in
English
General
greatly
to
this.
Somewhere
around
tenth
grade,
I
discovered
a
wonderful
fact
that
changed
my
life
as
a
poet.
I
came
across
the
idea
that
my
poems
did
not
have
to
rhyme
to
be
good.
In
fact,
they
gave
me
a
lot
of
room
for
creative
maneuver
and
even
sounded
better
when
they
did
not.
I
could
put
down
exactly
what
felt
right
in
words
without
having
to
brainstorm
about
whether
the
last
words
were
consistent.
Once
this
wondrous
fact
came
to
light,
I
took
to
poetry
with
a
vengeance
and
was
rewarded
when
I
won
an
online
poetry
contest
on
www.poetry.com.
My
poem
was
called
OThe
Perfect
MomentO,
where
I
talked
about
random
images
of
heaven
and
hell
and
pushed
my
darkest
fears
to
the
surface.
A
great
point
of
my
development
as
a
writer
came
when
I
started
preparing
for
my
SATs.
Where
my
peers
breezed
through
them
with
a
hasty
few
real
SATs
practiced
the
night
before
the
actual
exam,
I
spent
months
poring
over
the
BarronOs
three-thousand
word
list.
I
made
a
pact
with
myself
to
take
those
highbrow
words
to
the
grave.
It
was
part
of
my
master
plan
to
beat
forever
my
frustration
at
my
vocabulary,
which
to
my
eternal
consternation
never
seemed
plentiful
enough.
I
found
that
when
expanding
oneOs
vocabulary,
nothing
does
the
trick
the
way
flash
cards
do.
When
I
came
to
college,
I
had
high
hopes
as
a
potential
English
major.
I
had
a
vague
idea
of
what
I
wanted
to
do
with
my
life,
which
was
slowly
growing
like
palm
tree
inside
my
mind.
I
wanted
to
be
a
journalist
and
a
part-time
author.
A
daily
spot
on
a
national
newspaper
would
provide
the
realistic
current
events
writing
that
had
grown
on
me
as
I
had
trudged
through
argumentative
writing
through
my
school
years
and
found
that
making
definitive
statements
with
panache
certainly
had
its
appeal.
Being
a
part-time
author
would
give
my
ever-fertile,
flyaway
imagination
breathing
room,
and
provide
the
exciting
touch
to
my
professional
life.
My
first
year
seminar
was
on
a
topic
that
I
had
never
really
had
to
think
about
when
I
was
still
safely
ensconced
at
home.
Multiculturalism
was
an
issue
that
grabbed
my
interest
right
away.
It
was
reality-based,
had
economic
and
political
implications,
and
threw
in
the
intriguing
curve
of
human
psychology
that
I
found
irresistible.
For
the
first
time,
Internet
research
just
was
not
enough.
I
had
to
go
out
there
and
observe
people
and
their
behavior,
read
between
the
lines
when
they
made
off-hand
comments,
and
really
sink
my
teeth
into
the
prejudices
that,
to
my
shock,
I
found
were
alive
and
thriving
at
Lafayette
College.
It
was
a
fascinating
semester
and
at
the
end,
I
chose
to
focus
on
racism
for
my
final
paper.
I
threw
myself
into
the
paper,
writing
about
all
kinds
of
racism
I
had
ever
encountered,
considering
myself
an
ultimate
authority,
regarding
my
WA
as
a
superfluous
necessity.
My
paper
was
extensive
and
discursive,
a
lengthy
essay
totaling
just
under
twenty
pages.
Because
of
all
the
effort
I
had
put
into
it,
my
grade
was
a
shock.
I
found
it
staggeringly
unbelievable
that
I
had
gotten
a
D.
That
was
my
first
step
toward
understanding
college
writing.
Tail
between
my
legs,
I
went
to
my
professor
and
then
finally,
swallowing
my
pride,
consulted
my
WA.
She
sat
with
me
for
an
hour,
examining
my
paper
from
every
angle,
in
an
efficient,
yet
comprehensive
manner.
She
offered
several
suggestions
and
a
few
times
told
me
point-blank
what
she
believed
I
was
doing
wrong.
Then
I
rewrote
my
paper,
focusing
on
racism
specifically
in
my
native
country,
Pakistan.
I
lit
on
an
aspect
of
racism
that
was
unique;
it
was
a
covert
racism
against
anyone
not
of
South
Asian
origin,
in
the
form
of
treating
foreigners
in
a
manner
that
was
polite
to
the
point
of
being
distantly
hostile.
I
cited
examples
from
personal
observation
as
opposed
to
anything
I
might
have
found
on
the
Internet.
Magically,
my
grade
changed
overnight
from
a
D
to
an
A.
It
was
a
moment
of
epiphany,
and
that
was
the
first
time
I
realized
the
subtle,
yet
ever
present
value
of
the
WA
program.
I
got
exempted
from
College
Writing,
and
the
only
other
writing
course
I
have
taken
at
Lafayette
so
far,
besides
the
first
year
seminar,
is
Creative
Writing.
I
can,
in
all
honesty,
say
that
is
the
most
rewarding
course
I
have
taken
at
Lafayette
so
far.
It
was
an
intensive
three-hour
class
every
week,
where
we
wrote
and
discussed
and
commented
on
each
otherOs
writings.
The
open
discussion
helped
me
branch
out
into
different
techniques
of
poetry
and
fiction.
It
made
my
writing
even
bolder
and
more
unrestrained.
I
wrote
about
things
I
had
never
imagined
writing
about
before.
And
I
wrote
more
and
more,
until
the
wee
hours
of
morning.
Writing
for
that
class
was
never
like
a
chore;
it
felt
natural
as
if
I
was
finally
doing
something
I
was
meant
to
do.
Through
the
gentle
guidance
of
my
professor,
I
learned
to
critically
examine
my
own
writing
and
make
changes
when
needed.
It
was
amazing
how
adjusting
and
eliminating
a
few
words
here
and
there
could
metamorphose
a
piece
of
writing
from
mundane
to
phenomenal.
That
class
greatly
helped
me
grow
as
a
writer,
to
stretch
my
horizons
and
take
more
liberties
with
words,
and
to
describe
the
world
as
I
saw
it
rather
than
the
faint
shadow
of
something
I
might
have
read
in
a
long-ago
book.
At
the
end
of
the
semester,
when
I
saw
the
flier
up
on
Pardee,
it
was
natural
to
submit
my
application,
cross
my
fingers
and
hope
that
I
made
it
as
a
writing
associate.
I
thought
of
how
the
ethereal,
yet
undeniable
power
of
words
had
always
influenced
my
life,
and
I
felt
that
I
wanted
to
share
that
power
with
others,
and
to
help
them
see
writing
as
not
a
chore,
but
as
a
fulfilling
pleasure.
I
hope
that
as
a
WA,
I
can
make
that
happen.
