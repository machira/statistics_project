Thoughts
on
A
Year
and
More
of
Writing
The
first
year
of
college
is
a
transition
period,
the
second
year
a
growth
period,
in
writing
as
in
everything
else.
As
a
first-year
student
entering
college
courses,
writing
can
become
a
means
of
education
and
examination.
What
is
most
striking
about
this
interplay
between
personal
discovery
of
knowledge
and
outward
expression
of
that
discovery
in
the
form
of
assignments
is
that,
what
once
was
private
becomes
public
and
vice-versa.
Personal
thoughts
and
ideas
manifest
themselves
on
paper
that
can
be
shared
with
any
number
of
people
in
the
purpose
of
communication
and
networking
of
information
and
creativity,
just
as
the
shared
knowledge
and
education
can
be
channeled
through
a
personOs
mind
and
fitted
to
his
perspective
through
writing.
This
reverberation
of
knowledge,
discovery,
creativity,
and
personal
being
are
what
make
writing
an
integral
part
of
a
higher
education
and
something
to
be
desired
in
a
scholarOs
armory.
The
passage
of
education
from
public
lectures,
published
documents,
and
open
discussion
to
integration
in
oneOs
own
thesis
is
often
conducted
through
the
act
and
process
of
writing.
What
was
once
open
to
the
public
is
analyzed,
processed
and
made
anew
individually
before
it
is
regurgitated
back
for
public
display
and
use.
Through
writing,
we
take
ownership
of
our
education
by
putting
it
in
the
context
of
our
thoughts
and
interpretation.
This
act
of
ownership
may
sound
simple,
but
in
my
past
year
as
a
WA
for
a
First-Year
Seminar,
I
have
watched
students
struggle
with
taking
ownership
of
their
education
in
order
to
use
it
as
an
opportunity
to
create
something
original,
or
at
least
unlike
what
they
have
previously
done.
Speaking
with
students,
what
they
know
and
have
learned
in
lectures
or
discussion
can
be
taken
for
granted
until
it
is
given
permanence
and
presence
on
paper.
This
first
step
is
the
most
elementary,
writing
of
what
you
know,
but
often
the
most
useful,
as
what
one
knows
may
not
be
apparent
until
we
are
able
to
put
it
into
words.
These
are
the
easy
questions
to
ask
students
as
a
WA:
what
do
you
know
and
what
important
things
have
you
learned?
One
further
step
may
be
then:
what
do
you
want
to
know?
This
question
may
need
to
be
answered
by
research
and
further
introspection,
which
is
why
students
may
find
it
hard
to
get
past
the
most
obvious
answers
to
the
question
of
what
is
already
known.
But
the
best
writing,
I
have
found
so
far,
is
that
which
ponders
more
uncertain
answers
from
a
host
of
different
backgrounds.
I
imagine
generalities
and
extrapolations,
which
I
often
come
across
in
studentsO
papers,
are
resorted
to
either
because
of
indolence
in
research
or
failure
to
follow
the
material.
I
have
always
thought
to
question
my
authority
as
a
writer,
especially
as
I
ascend
into
higher
levels
of
scholarship,
so
in
matters
of
research
and
expositive,
even
persuasive
writing,
Less
and
less
have
I
found
that
myself
as
well
as
other
writers
can
rely
on
what
they
have
already
learned,
but
must
find
out
the
answers
to
what
we
have
yet
to
discover
in
the
material
or
from
outside
sources.
Taking
othersO
ideas
or
writing
and
creating
a
personal
account
imbues
how
material
is
ingested,
in
what
ways
it
is
discussed
and
what
is
learned
as
a
result.
Since
attending
college
for
two
years,
the
material
in
class
and
available
elsewhere
has
always
held
potential,
and
there
are
sources
anywhere
which
can
inspire
the
creativity
and
originality
of
writing.
Being
a
WA
allows
me
to
be
a
party
to
this
development
of
ideas
and
writing.
Having
previously
taken
the
First-Year
Seminar
for
which
I
was
assigned
to
be
a
WA
my
first
semester,
I
tried
not
to
let
my
own
interpretation
and
ideas
hinder
the
studentsO.
From
their
feedback
at
the
end
of
the
semester,
however,
I
learned
that
the
students
most
appreciated
when
I
was
familiar
with
the
material
and
could
more
ardently
impress
their
ideas
and
develop
them,
which
will
not
always
be
the
case
for
WAOs
in
different
classes,
as
I
have
learned.
This
may
be
a
difficulty
for
students
who
meet
with
WAs:
their
expectations
of
inspiration
or
Ofix-itO
go
only
so
far
as
the
student
is
willing
to
participate
and
has
some
inclination
on
which
to
build.
Otherwise,
this
process
of
ideas
and
creation
becomes
a
chore
of
which
the
WA
may
become
overlord.
Open-ended
questions
which
the
WA
knows
the
student
can
answer
are
a
good
place
to
start
for
spurring
progress
in
this
direction
of
material
to
student
writing,
because
leading
questions,
which
can
make
quite
a
bit
of
headway,
are
dependent
of
the
WAs
knowledge,
and
not
that
of
the
student.
From
my
first
semester,
that
was
one
of
my
biggest
lessons
and
one
of
the
hardest
to
give
up:
to
rely
on
the
studentOs
knowledge
for
ideas
and
direction
but
to
the
WA
for
encouragement
and
perspective.
From
my
second
semester,
the
assignments
I
worked
on
with
students
allowed
me
to
take
a
look
at
how
the
structure
of
an
assignment
can
position
studentsO
thinking
and
direct
the
instruction
they
receive
from
sources.
In
this
Engineering
class,
what
students
wrote
became
what
they
learned.
So,
assignments
on
ethics
and
engineering
projects
allowed
students
to
research
topics
and
respond
in
writing
to
only
what
they
happened
to
come
across
most
quickly
in
research
and
base
it
on
previous
judgments
and
class
discussion.
Trying
to
tease
students
into
covering
all
their
bases
in
an
argumentative
paper
while
still
strongly
adhering
to
professorsO
strictures
on
taking
a
stance,
using
perspective,
and
incorporating
evidence,
is
a
daunting
dilemma.
Even
though
the
students
may
focus
on
what
they
have
recently
learned
in
papers,
they
still
have
to
consider
their
audience.
To
convince
an
audience
of
your
authority
and
consideration,
a
writer
has
to
acknowledge
a
number
of
perspectives
and
angles
so
that
the
writing
addresses
not
only
what
the
writer
is
thinking,
but
also
the
thought
of
the
audience.
WAs
are
an
exceptional
barometer
of
their
success,
though
the
WAOs
personal
viewpoint
shouldnOt
be
allowed
to
eclipse
that
of
the
audience
members.
A
difference
of
opinion
between
the
WA
acting
on
behalf
of
the
audience
and
that
of
the
writer
who
is
very
attached
to
his
own
thoughts
and
ideas
can
be
seen
as
interference.
Providing
an
explanation
of
why
the
student
should
consider
ideas
he
hadnOt
heretofore
thought
of
may
supersede
misunderstandings.
By
reviewing
a
studentOs
paper,
I
found
myself
asking
students
to
reevaluate
a
lot
of
their
work
sometimes,
based
on
my
word.
Though
they
shouldnOt
feel
obligated
to
follow
whatever
I
suggest,
I
sometimes
found
myself
wondering
how
much
of
the
suggestion
I
myself
would
be
willing
to
do,
and
so
I
came
to
the
conclusion
not
to
ask
students
to
do
anything
I
myself
wouldnOt
do,
though
I
may
offer
suggestion
if
they
have
time.
For
example,
suggesting
that
a
student
change
the
tone
of
the
entire
paper
or
reevaluate
his
argument
the
night
before
an
assignment
is
due
is
something
I
believe
to
be
unfair.
I
will
however,
tell
the
student
what
I
think
but
work
with
students
to
find
ways
to
make
improvements
according
to
the
studentsO
schedule.
Criticism
is
useful
for
future
reference,
but
if
it
isnOt
constructive,
I
like
to
make
allowances
and
find
ways
to
make
improvements
that
fit
the
studentsO
abilities.
This
is
why
getting
to
know
the
students
that
are
assigned
to
a
WA
is
desirable;
so
that
criticism
can
be
adjusted
to
the
studentsO
abilities
and
lifestyle.
I
found
that
by
varying
the
depth
and
type
of
criticism
according
to
individual
students,
they
were
more
willing
to
work
with
me
and
accept
criticism.
Helping
other
students
learn
to
accept
constructive
criticism
and
guidance
reverberated
in
my
own
view
of
criticism
and
peer
review
towards
my
own
writing.
Before
college,
I
viewed
writing
as
a
highly
personal
act,
a
tangible
reproduction
of
thoughts
and
ideas
and
expression,
only
to
be
shared
with
evaluators
in
a
professionally
detached
sense.
Peer
revision
was
conducted
stringently
and
superficially.
Since
becoming
a
WA,
I
have
learned
the
value
of
a
purposeful
reviewer.
Placing
trust
in
anotherOs
opinion
can
be
considered
a
risk
to
those
who
fear
criticism,
but
the
Writing
Program
helps
dissolve
that
barrier
and
make
students
more
comfortable
towards
criticism.
As
a
WA,
I
not
only
found
myself
in
the
position
of
critiquing
othersO
writing,
but
having
my
own
methods
critiqued,
making
me
much
more
sensitive
to
the
writing
process
and
audience.
This
made
me
aware
that
it
is
important
not
to
judge
anotherOs
writing,
but
to
discuss
it
and
develop
it,
because
I
have
found
writing
to
be
a
highly
personal
act
which
some
writers
relish
sharing,
while
others
find
it
to
be
much
more
vulnerable.
The
transition
from
a
personal
piece
of
writing
to
public
document
is
one
I
have
grappled
with
because
of
my
own
way
of
writing
and
the
amount
of
voice
I
infuse
into
it.
Knowing
when
to
use
a
strong
voice
and
when
to
let
the
content
color
the
voice
is
a
negotiation
I
am
constantly
making
because
it
affects
the
tone,
presentation,
structure,
and
anything
else
that
organizes
a
piece
of
writing.
Being
exposed
to
othersO
voices
as
their
WA
and
peer
reviewer
makes
me
more
conscious
of
my
own.
While
helping
other
students
with
their
structure
or
content,
asking
questions
and
letting
the
student
speak
is
a
great
way
to
let
them
locate
their
voice.
IOll
often
ask
myself
the
same
questions
and
make
sure
that
I
rely
on
more
than
voice
to
provide
evidence
or
discussion.
Writing,
I
have
found,
is
not
only
a
practice
of
sound
use
of
words
and
grammar,
but
also
of
reason
and
logic.
Capturing
the
audience
in
the
writing,
whether
for
creative,
scholarly,
or
persuasive
purposes
is
dependent
largely
on
voice
and
presentation.
I
worked
with
a
lot
of
argument
and
expositive
papers
which
took
a
stance
on
issues
over
the
year,
and
IOve
discovered
that
it
doesnOt
matter
how
much
research
or
discussion
one
has
conducted
if
it
doesnOt
present
itself
in
oneOs
writing.
Students
writing
essays
and
researching
assignments
must
find
a
way
to
transform
acquired
knowledge
and
information
through
the
medium
of
writing,
sometimes
creatively,
sometimes
originally,
or
succinctly,
persuasively,
scientifically,
ethically
and
in
many
more
ways.
Being
able
to
adapt
to
different
purposes
of
writing
given
different
stipulations
and
audiences
is
one
of
the
marvels
and
struggles
of
writing,
especially
if
trying
to
convey
something
meaningful
rather
than
frivolous.
As
a
Biology
major,
Newspaper
writer,
student
in
Government
courses,
and
dabbler
in
creative
writing,
my
repertoire
of
writing
spans
many
venues.
My
involvement
in
the
College
Writing
Program
only
enhances
the
multitude
of
writing
one
encounters
and
the
importance
of
never
following
only
one
method
in
its
production.
My
government
classes
entail
more
prethought
and
class
discussion,
whereas
Bio
classes
have
taken
more
research
and
background
knowledge.
Newspaper
relies
on
quotes
and
a
dialogue
with
the
audience,
and
creative
writing
uses
morphed
experiences
and
a
story.
I
have
looked
at
argument,
creative,
analytical,
and
expositive
papers
as
a
WA
which
were
prescribed
by
the
professor
to
follow
a
certain
formula.
Exposure
to
different
modes
of
writing
and
practice
in
applying
them
is
essential
for
a
writerOs
resume
and
toolkit,
but
are
difficult
to
access
when
trying
to
meet
the
standards
of
different
professors
with
different
theories
of
good
writing
and
different
desires
of
materials
they
deem
must
be
incorporated.
Keeping
up
with
professors
standards
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
novelties
of
college
writing.
In
the
Engineering
class
I
worked
with,
the
students
voiced
opinions
that
the
professor
reversed
progress
in
their
writing
and
had
strict
criteria
because
she
thought
that
lower
standards
and
more
guidance
were
needed
for
her
class.
One
of
the
more
challenging
adventures
of
being
a
WA
is
interacting
with
students
who
receive
feedback
both
from
the
WA
in
meetings,
and
from
professors
either
from
comments
or
grades.
Consistence
with
every
professor
one
works
with
is
unlikely
and
detrimental
to
students
who
seek
peer
perspectives.
A
student
may
take
a
class
with
a
professor
for
one
semester,
but
will
be
writing
for
a
good
portion
of
their
lives
and
for
the
benefit
of
many
more
people.
On
the
other
hand,
WAs
are
often
judged
by
how
they
match
the
evaluation
of
the
professor
and
the
advice
they
can
dispense
towards
bolstering
success
in
the
class,
not
in
writing.
To
appreciate
a
Writing
Associate
and
the
act
of
writing,
students
who
meet
with
WAs
must
not
expect
them
to
distribute
formulas
for
successful
writing,
but
to
discuss
and
help
discover
how
to
approach
different
forms
of
writing
one
encounters
in
an
academic
and
scholarly
environment.
My
first
year
as
a
Writing
Associate
has
fostered
a
much
more
intimate
relationship
with
my
own
writing
as
well
as
the
writing
of
others.
The
concept
of
writing
to
be
an
exclusive
and
personal
act
now
includes
writing
as
an
act
to
be
shared
and
collaborated
between
peers
and
sources.
From
my
experience
as
a
WA
and
within
my
own
practice,
I
have
learned
that
writing
is
not
only
for
my
own
benefit,
but
must
be
written
for
the
benefit
of
an
academic,
interested,
or
even
uninterested
party.
With
such
a
wide
audience,
matters
of
organizational
structure
and
internal
content
and
device
must
be
considered
to
appeal
to
an
audience
and
impart
the
missive
of
the
piece
of
writing.
But
all
of
these
take
more
than
a
year
to
be
used
decisively
with
experience.
