WA
Paper
Personal
history
as
a
writer
I
can
remember
learning
to
write
in
first
grade,
letter
by
letter.
Mrs.
Eldridge
wrote
each
letter
on
the
board
one
at
a
time
and
we
copied
them
down,
each
letter
ten
times,
until
we
had
perfected
the
entire
alphabet.
After
letters
we
moved
onto
numbers
and
this
is
where
my
difficulties
as
a
writer
began.
I
did
not
understand
how
to
correctly
draw
a
figure
eight.
I
had
mastered
the
written
ABC's
and
numbers
1-10
all
except
for
the
number
8.
I
insisted
that
the
number
could
be
written
just
two
circles,
one
smaller
on
top
of
one
larger.
However,
Mrs.
Eldridge
insisted
otherwise,
thus
my
struggle
continued.
It
was
probably
only
six
or
seven
minutes
in
which
I
wrote
line
after
line
of
awkward
and
ugly
figure
eights,
yet,
as
a
first
grader
encountering
her
first
real
academic
problem,
it
seemed
hours
before
something
in
my
mind
clicked
and
my
pencil
began
to
draw
perfect
figure
eights.
After
that
the
number
eight
was
my
favorite
number
to
write.
When
the
year
1988
rolled
around
in
the
midst
of
second
grade
I
was
secretly
quite
thrilled
because
now,
when
I
wrote
the
date
on
each
of
my
papers,
I
got
to
write
two
eights
instead
of
just
one.
(I'm
serious,
that's
not
just
a
line
to
take
up
room
in
this
paper...)
It's
funny
looking
back
on
this.
Now
it
seems
a
large
exaggeration
to
even
label
this
memory
a
struggle.
Yet
I
remember
it
so
vividly,
I
was
so
annoyed
with
myself
that
the
girl
next
to
me
had
a
line
of
ten
perfect
eights
and
I
had
only
a
series
of
circles.
At
that
time
it
was
definitely
a
serious
battle,
and
unfortunately
not
the
last
on
my
journey
becoming
a
writer.
This
one
memory
is
actually
quite
representative
of
later
struggles.
As
I
look
back
I
can
see
a
pattern
that
is
quite
clear.
I
often
get
caught
up
on
one
main
idea,
get
incredibly
frustrated,
often
times
find
myself
crying,
and
then
after
a
bit
of
work
something
in
my
mind
clicks
and
I
continue
on
not
understanding
how
I
ever
wrote
any
other
way.
As
I
grew
I
moved
on
from
numbers
and
letters
and
graduated
into
middle
school
and
research
projects.
I
remember
having
several
of
these
projects
throughout
middle
school,
but
the
one
I
remember
most
clearly
dealt
with
each
student's
individual
heritage.
We
had
to
study
a
country
of
our
family's
origin
and
write
about
several
different
aspects
including
climate,
people,
history,
culture,
etc...
It
was
with
this
project
that
I
found
what
would
be
the
key
to
my
writing
success
throughout
middle
school,
my
Dad.
It
was
at
his
suggestion
that
I
chose
to
study
Croatia
instead
of
England.
Several
people
might
research
England,
he
told
me,
while
Croatia
would
be
unique.
I
agreed
and
started
my
research
as
the
teachers
suggested.
I
went
to
the
library
and
got
out
some
books
but
it
wasn't
too
long
before
I
was
overwhelmed
with
information
and
had
no
idea
what
I
was
doing.
Up
until
this
point
I
had
always
known
exactly
how
to
do
my
schoolwork
and
how
to
do
it
well.
Now,
I
didn't
know
what
to
do
with
the
books,
what
to
do
with
the
information,
how
to
start
writing
it
down
or
even
what
exactly
to
write
down.
I
became
extremely
frustrated
and
probably
started
crying
until
my
dad
took
me
and
together
we
began
to
organize
the
information.
We
wrote
the
entire
project
together.
In
the
spirit
of
dad's
however,
he
probably
helped
me
a
little
bit
too
much.
I
can
remember
sitting
at
the
kitchen
table
every
night
after
dinner
writing
different
sections
of
the
paper.
We
would
talk
about
the
information,
I
would
suggest
a
sentence,
and
he
would
then
say
something
like
this,
"Yeah
Jax,
that's
good,
how
about
this..."
and
with
slight
rewording
and
editing,
my
sentence
would
have
flow
and
sophistication.
I
also
remember
my
mom
walking
into
the
kitchen
to
remind
my
father
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
my
paper.
While
it
probably
should
have
been
a
bit
more
my
paper
instead
of
our
paper,
I
believe
that
my
father's
help
throughout
middle
school
and
early
high
school
helped
me
in
the
long
run.
Now
that
I
am
older
I
see
many
similarities
in
our
writing
and
looking
back
I
can
see
that
his
help
greatly
influenced
the
style
of
writing
I
was
to
develop.
More
importantly
than
style
however,
my
dad
taught
me
the
process
of
writing,
how
to
take
notes
and
turn
my
notes
into
sentences
and
then
how
to
edit
with
a
very
critical
eye.
Up
until
11th
grade
I
didn't
turn
in
a
written
assignment
without
having
my
father
read
and
edit
it.
He
was
a
critical
part
of
my
writing
process
not
only
concerning
individual
papers,
but
also
the
long-term
process
of
my
writing
development.
The
end
of
10
grade,
however,
was
the
end
of
many
things
I
had
grown
accustomed
to
concerning
my
writing
career.
My
final
paper
for
Mr.
Wolf
was
about
Dr.
Seuss
and
it
was
the
last
time
I
would
be
allowed
to
paraphrase
to
such
an
extent
and
also
the
last
time
I
would
use
my
father's
help
to
such
an
extent.
Eleventh
grade
brought
me
to
Mr.
Bickford
who
to
this
day
is
one
of
the
best
teachers
I
have
ever
had.
Eleventh
grade
also
brought
me
my
first
C
and
my
first
D,
but
also
it
brought
me
my
first
paper,
not
our,
but
my
first
paper.
Junior
year
of
high
school,
I
can
definitively
say,
was
when
I
learned
to
write.
It
was
in
this
year
that
I
learned
how
to
bring
my
own
ideas
and
my
own
thinking
into
papers.
I
was
forced
to
ask
the
question
"Why?"
to
every
sentence
I
wrote
so
that
I
could
bring
my
papers
to
a
deeper
level.
I
am
embarrassed
to
admit
that
up
until
junior
year
I
didn't
fully
understand
the
meaning
of
'thesis
statement.'
I
could
tell
you
the
black
board
definition,
but
I
never
understood
the
importance
a
thesis
took
in
shaping
a
writer's
thinking
and
thus,
a
writer's
paper.
I
had
always
insisted
that
I
didn't
need
a
thesis
in
my
papers,
my
father's
editing
always
seemed
to
fill
in
any
holes
I
had.
I
believed
I
didn't
need
a
thesis
until
Mr.
Bickford
returned
to
us
our
first
papers.
It
had
been
a
difficult
paper
to
write,
unlike
any
assignment
I
had
ever
been
given.
I
had
to
think
of
something
about
The
Scarlet
Letter
and
write
about
it;
I
had
to
develop
my
own
thesis.
After
struggling
with
the
assignment
for
a
few
days
I
typed
out
a
couple
of
pages
and
handed
it
in.
I
remember
vividly
when
we
got
these
papers
back
and
it
was
clear
that
my
previous
beliefs
and
writing
habits
were
going
to
have
to
change.
I
had
never
received
a
D
before
in
my
life
and
I
was
absolutely
shocked.
However,
this
one
bad
grade
forced
me
to
learn
the
meaning
of
'thesis.'
I
spoke
with
my
teacher
and
he
gave
me
several
papers
to
read
as
examples
of
good
writing.
I
remember
one
of
these
papers
quite
clearly
and
how
it
helped
me
to
understand
the
real
function
of
a
thesis.
It
was
being
able
to
actually
see
the
thesis
and
see
how
it
ran
through
the
entire
paper,
supported
with
evidence
from
the
book
and
unique
arguments,
that
led
me
to
this
understanding.
Just
as
something
had
clicked
with
the
figure
eight,
something
clicked
here
and
after
only
one
or
two
more
awkward
papers
I
was
well
on
my
way
to
writing
clear
and
well
supported
thesis
statements.
Also
in
the
same
manner
as
with
the
figure
eights,
I
couldn't
understand
how
I
had
ever
written
a
paper
in
my
earlier
years
without
a
thesis.
Having
a
main
idea
to
guide
me
through
my
writing
was
essential
and
as
I
began
to
earn
A's
from
Mr.
Bickford
I
finally
knew
that
I
had
broken
away
from
my
dad's
help
and
into
a
style
of
my
own.
Senior
year
of
high
school
concentrated
on
college
essay
writing
which
led
me
to
my
Lafayette
acceptance.
Looking
back
on
freshman
year
at
Lafayette
I
see
somewhat
of
a
small
step
backward
in
my
writing.
Without
the
strong
and
demanding
teachers
I
had
previously,
I
fell
back
into
bad
habits
and
lacked
the
self-motivation
to
take
much
initiative
in
my
writing.
Because
I
could
manage
decent
grades
with
minimal
effort,
that's
all
I
put
forth.
Sophomore
year,
however,
was
a
completely
different
story.
My
literary
questions
course
was
the
college
equivalent
of
Mr.
Bickford.
I
went
through
the
same
process
here
that
I
did
in
11th
grade.
My
first
few
paper
grades
were
dismal,
but
after
a
bit
of
work
and
a
large
amount
of
frustration,
I
began
to
excel.
Minimal
effort
here
awarded
only
C
and
check
minus
papers.
In
this
course
I
was
expected
to
work
hard
and
to
put
forth
the
time
and
effort
it
took
to
succeed.
I
was
taught
to
read,
think,
and
write
critically.
The
importance
of
a
thesis
and
introductory
paragraph
was
again
hammered
into
my
head
through
examples
of
other
works.
I
was
taught
to
read
deeply
into
both
other
authors
works
and
my
own
and
to
critic
each
heavily.
I
learned
how
to
identify
good
ideas
and
good
arguments
and
more
importantly
how
to
write
them.
I
left
this
course
mentally
exhausted,
but
knowing
how
to
write
a
good
paper.
It's
interesting
to
look
back
on
this
history
and
reflect
on
the
milestones
in
my
writing.
I
can
remember
that
in
each
of
the
instances
I
have
talked
about,
what
made
that
something
in
my
mind
click
and
what
made
everything
all
of
sudden
come
together,
was
seeing
examples
of
other
people's
work.
Watching
exactly
how
my
teacher
drew
the
number
eight,
and
seeing
how
my
father
edited
my
papers
over
and
over
again
helped
me
learn
to
edit
my
own
papers.
Reading
essays
of
my
peer's
in
high
school
and
college
led
me
to
an
understanding
of
good
writing
and
gave
me
a
solid
base
off
which
to
work.
Throughout
all
my
schooling
I
have
learned
that
this
is
the
best
way
in
which
I
master
new
levels
of
academic
writing.
Even
now,
if
I
feel
that
I
am
struggling
with
an
understanding
of
something
I
often
ask
a
professor
if
there
is
an
exceptional
paper
I
could
read.
Doing
this
lets
me
actually
see
how
an
assignment
becomes
a
work
and
gives
me
a
sort
of
grounding
that
I
need
to
succeed
and
create
my
own
works.
It
is
ironic,
however,
that
I
learn
in
this
manner
because
I
am
very
shy
about
my
own
work.
I
don't
like
to
share
it
nor
have
many
people
see
it.
This
is
true
not
only
with
my
writing
but
also
with
my
artwork,
photography,
or
just
general
homework
assignments.
I
can't
quite
pin
point
why
this
is
for
I'm
not
too
easily
embarrassed
in
general.
When
it
comes
to
something
I
have
worked
on
and
produced,
however,
I
am
very
shy.
Even
when
I
believe
that
my
work
is
well
written
or
artistically
advanced
I
am
hesitant
to
show
people
for
it
is
slightly
embarrassing.
This
is
difficult
for
me
to
explain
because
I
don't
completely
understand
the
way
I
work
in
this
regard.
It
seems
that
while
I
am
generally
confident
in
the
quality
of
my
work
I
like
to
have
the
opinion
of
someone
I
look
up
to.
At
the
same
time
however,
it
is
this
opinion
that
I
am
embarrassed
by.
I
have
always
held
teachers
and
professors
in
a
very
high
esteem
and
their
comments
have
always
had
a
big
influence
on
me,
yet
even
when
I
receive
an
A
on
a
paper
or
high
marks
on
an
art
project,
my
assured
confidence
does
not
alleviate
my
shyness.
Whatever
the
psychological
reason
for
my
shyness
may
be,
and
while
it
may
inhibit
the
way
in
which
I
display
my
works,
it
does
not
get
in
the
way
of
my
desire
to
improve
and
to
succeed
in
my
assignments.
When
I
find
a
teacher
that
pushes
my
mind
and
abilities
to
the
limit
I
work
hard
to
impress
that
teacher
and
to
live
up
to
the
standards
they
set.
In
these
teachers
I
find
a
quality
that
I
admire
immensely.
Perhaps
it
is
the
outward
confidence
they
exhibit,
but
perhaps
not,
I'm
not
quite
sure.
Whatever
it
is
contains
some
force
that
inspires
me
and
creates
in
me
the
desire
to
learn
and
to
succeed
at
the
highest
level
possible.
