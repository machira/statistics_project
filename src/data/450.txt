Returning
WA
Narrative
August
16,
2004
This
past
year
has
been
a
whirlwind,
and
remembering
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
spring
semester
is
hard
enough,
let
alone
recalling
the
fall
semester.
However,
for
the
sake
of
this
narrative,
IOll
try
to
recount
as
much
as
I
can,
writing-wise
and
WA-wise.
In
regards
to
the
type
of
writing
that
I
did,
this
year
has
been
uniqueNa
considerable
percentage
of
writing
(and
reading)
was
in
the
German
language,
courtesy
of
German
literature
courses
and
Excel
work.
Good
writing
is
good
writing,
no
matter
the
language,
and
knowing
German
has
broadened
and
enhanced
my
sense
of
good
writing.
I
mention
this
because
writing
in
German
has
helped
me
to
better
understand
writing
in
English;
learning
and
using
a
second
language
demystifies
language
usage
in
general.
ItOs
hard
to
explain,
but
writing
is
as
much
a
conscious
act
as
it
is
unconscious,
and
learning
a
second
language
allows
the
writer
to
be
more
aware
of
the
conscious
aspect
of
writing.
Conscious
decisions,
like
choosing
certain
words
over
others,
constructing
sentences
in
a
certain
fashion,
and
being
able
to
proofread
and
critique
oneOs
own
writing
are
the
steps
that
lead
to
good
writing.
And
when
I
write
in
German,
itOs
a
mostly
conscious
effortNI
have
to
think,
and
carefully
consider
my
words
and
how
IOm
arranging
them,
and
reread
and
edit.
This
process
may
seem
arduous
at
times,
but
this
is
how
good
writing
is
achieved.
But
because
English
is
my
native
language,
I
donOt
necessarily
have
to
do
thisNI
donOt
have
to
really
thinkNwords
and
thoughts
just
automatically
and
instantly
come
to
me,
as
IOm
sure
most
people
experience
with
their
native
language.
But
as
I
said,
good
writing
is
not
founded
upon
thoughtless
impulseNwhich
is
often
the
easiest
way
through
a
writing
assignmentNbut
upon
careful,
deliberate
thought.
An
awareness
and
concern
for
Process
is
the
key
to
good
writing
for
me,
and
I'll
return
to
this
a
little
later
on.
In
terms
of
my
WA
work
and
being
a
WA,
the
past
year
was
pretty
typicalNIOve
had
no
terrible
experiences;
theyOve
been
good
on
the
whole.
In
fact,
IOd
hazard
to
say
that
being
a
WA
is
only
something
that
gets
easier
with
time.
After
two
years
of
working
as
a
WA,
I
feel
even
more
comfortable
and
confident
than
I
did
after
one
year.
The
great
advantage
of
being
a
WA
was
that
it
kept
me
on
my
toes,
writing-wise.
Even
when
there
might
have
been
a
writing-lull
in
my
own
academic
life,
writing
issues
never
strayed
far
from
my
mind
because
of
WA
conferences
or
Drop-In
hours.
Writing
was
always
fresh
on
my
mind,
and
this
only
helped
me
when
I
had
to
do
my
own
writing
for
my
classes.
When
I
look
back
upon
the
year,
I
feel
that
IOve
come
to
learn
a
lot
about
myselfNnot
only
in
terms
of
writing,
but
more
generally.
I
suppose
this
is
because
IOve
made
some
important
decisions
about
what
I
want
to
do
with
my
life
after
college
(pursue
my
masters
of
fine
arts
in
painting),
and
IOve
expanded
my
perspective
to
include
my
ultimate
career
goals
and
aspirations.
And
I
feel
that
this
general
understanding
of
myself
has
greatly
impacted,
among
other
things,
the
role
that
writing
plays
in
my
life.
Quite
simply,
I
have
noticed
a
shift
in
my
relationship
to
writing,
and
it
seems
like
it
occurred
rather
suddenly,
although
I
suspect
itOs
been
slowly
progressing
to
this
point
for
some
time
now.
There
was
a
period
in
my
life
when
writing
was
a
passionNactually,
a
very
viable
career
option,
in
fact.
All
throughout
high
school,
and
even
earlier
on,
I
relished
every
writing
assignment
with
gusto,
because
I
felt
that
it
was
my
chance
to
shineNto
put
my
words
to
work
and
prove
what
I
was
capable
of.
I
loved
writing
English
essays
especially,
and
watching
how
my
writing
improved
with
each
subsequent
essay.
This
attitude
remained
intact
as
I
began
college,
but
after
three
years,
I
have
noticed
a
changeNcertainly
not
for
the
worse
(or
the
better,
for
that
matter)Nbut
a
change
nonetheless.
I
still
have
a
great
affection
for
writingNthis
has
not
changed,
and
I
daresay
it
never
willN
but
it
is
no
longer
a
boundless
joy,
but
more
a
matter-of-fact
task.
As
an
English
major,
a
college
studentNan
intellectual
personNwriting
is
a
necessity,
and
one
is
expected
to
do
it
and
do
it
well.
This
is
fine;
IOm
a
good
writer
(and
reader),
and
so
I
do
what
I
have
to
do.
But
this
is
the
keyNI
write
because
I
have
toNI
write
for
someone
else
and
not
for
myself
and
I
think
that
this
is
the
crux
of
it
all.
When
I
write
for
myself,
it
is
because
IOm
emotionally
driven
to
do
soNitOs
really
a
means
of
self-expressionNand
when
I
write
something
that
I
feel
personally
and
intimately
connected
to,
that
is
when
writing
is
wonderful.
I
still
get
this
feeling
when
I
write
poetry,
which
functions
as
a
diary
for
me.
But
I
rarely
get
this
feeling
when
I
write
for
my
classesNI
used
to,
but
it
has
somehow
faded
away.
(Or
maybe
it
hasnOt
faded
away.
Maybe
it
has
only
been
transferred
to
another
activity,
because
making
artNpainting
in
particularNinspires
this
feeling
in
me.)
When
I
write
for
my
classes,
IOm
writing
for
my
professorsNnot
for
myselfNand
IOm
writing
to
achieve
a
certain
grade.
And
the
interesting
thing
is,
I
donOt
have
to
be
emotionally
connected
to
what
IOm
writing
to
do
thisNI
donOt
have
to
agree
with
the
assignment;
I
donOt
even
have
to
like
the
assignment,
but
I
can
still
write
well
and
do
what
I
need
to
do.
But
this
disinterestNthis
emotional
disconnectionNdefinitely
affects
the
writing
experience
for
meNand
this
is
how
a
joy
has
become
a
task.
What
it
all
comes
down
to
is
Process
and
Product,
and
this
is
true
not
just
with
writing
but
also
with
art,
as
IOve
noticed
through
painting.
It
is
the
Process
of
writing
that
makes
writing
enjoyable;
it
is
the
Process
of
writing
that
yields
pleasure
and
satisfaction
and
a
sense
of
accomplishmentNit
is
during
the
Process
that
we
learn
how
to
write
better--
become
better;
in
short,
itOs
the
Process
that
makes
a
writer
a
writer,
not
the
Product.
Now,
IOm
not
saying
that
the
ProductNthe
final
polished
piece
of
writingNis
not
important
or
doesnOt
hold
any
meaning
for
the
writer
or
the
reader.
On
the
contrary,
all
the
reader
cares
about,
invariably,
is
the
Product;
how
the
writer
got
to
that
point
is
moot,
as
long
as
the
writing
does
what
it
needs
to
do.
And
often,
I
think,
the
writer
feels
the
sameNas
long
as
I
produce
something,
thinks
the
(student)
writer,
as
long
as
I
get
a
good
grade,
who
cares
how
I
actually
wrote
the
piece?
Unfortunately,
more
often
than
not,
the
answer
is
that
no
one
cares
how
a
writer
wrote
a
piece,
as
long
as
itOs
his/her
honest
work.
Yet
the
danger
in
this
is
clearNneglecting
the
Process
negates
the
Product,
because
what
is
the
Product
but
the
culmination
of
Process?
Being
a
WA
has
made
me
especially
aware
of
this:
the
struggle
between
Process
and
Product.
Most
students
want
a
Product,
because
itOs
the
Product
that
will
get
them
the
grade.
And
yet
what
they
really
should
want
is
a
ProcessNa
Process
that
works
for
them
and
that,
consequently,
consistently
produces
a
quality
Product.
So
while
the
importance
of
the
Product
cannot
be
denied,
the
Process
is
by
far
the
most
important
aspect
of
writing.
Put
every
ounce
of
energy
and
attention
into
the
Process
and
the
Product
will
take
care
of
itself.
For
me,
as
I
have
suggested
above,
it
is
the
Process
of
writing
that
makes
writing
truly
enjoyable
for
me.
When
I
recall
my
best
writing
experiences,
what
made
them
so
great
was
the
Process,
not
the
final
Product
and
the
grade
I
received.
The
Process
of
writing
is
a
sort
of
exertionNa
mental
exertionNthat
requires
focus
and
concentration,
a
relaxed
mindset,
a
congenial
environment,
and
a
considerable
duration
of
uninterrupted
timeNat
least
for
me.
Yet,
as
a
college
student,
finding
any
of
these
is
a
challengeNdistractions
abound
and
procrastination
is
a
constant
threat.
And
when
there
is
no
emotional
connection
to
the
work,
that
makes
it
all
the
harder.
When
there
is
no
emotional
connection,
the
Process
of
writing
becomes
nothing
more
than
a
list
of
steps,
systematically
followed
to
achieve
the
desired
result.
Lately,
this
has
been
the
situation
for
me.
IOve
reached
the
point
in
my
writing
skills
where
I
know
what
it
takes
to
make
good
writing,
and
I
have
a
vast
assortment
of
methods
and
tricks
that
I
refer
to
that
essentially
make
writing
well
a
foolproof
process
for
me.
And
yet
when
writing
becomes
nothing
more
than
a
Process
of
predictable,
prescribed
steps,
thereOs
no
enjoyment
in
it.
An
emotional
connection
allows
for
unpredictability,
because
itOs
hard
to
predict
just
where
the
emotions
will
lead.
In
this
case,
the
Process
is
unpremeditatedNitOs
almost
entirely
reactionary
as
it
unwinds
as
it
will.
ItOs
fun
to
go
with
the
flow,
so
to
speak,
and
let
the
piece
write
itself.
Note
though,
IOm
not
suggesting
that
all
logical
writing
steps
be
abandoned
to
incoherent,
chaotic
capriciousness
or
to
the
whims
of
oneOs
emotions.
Process
implies
that
some
sort
of
sensible
structure
existsNthat
there
are
limits
and
restrictions
in
place.
However,
itOs
how
one
operates
within
that
structure,
minding
the
limits
and
restrictions
yet
ignoring
them
when
appropriateNthis
is
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
Process.
And
when
there
is
an
emotional
connection,
the
Process
is
a
process
of
creationNof
making
some
intangible
aspect
of
oneself
tangibleNof
making
nonphysical
thought
physical,
concrete.
And
this
is
what
I
find
exciting
about
writing
and
language.
Yes,
the
Process
of
writing
is
emotionally
draining,
but
the
Process
is
so
much
richer
and
more
rewarding
this
way.
And
as
much
as
itOs
draining,
itOs
simultaneously
invigoratingNwhen
IOm
writing,
and
IOm
in
the
zoneNwhen
the
outside
world
falls
away
and
nothing
exists
but
myself
and
the
writingNwhen
the
piece
writes
itselfNthis
is
when
I
become
a
better
writer,
stretching
the
limits
of
my
ability,
enjoying
the
moment
of
total
connection
with
my
work.
Perhaps
this
appears
a
little
too
idyllic
or
over-dramatic,
and
it
is
to
a
certain
extentNdeadlines
and
due
dates
demand
that
work
be
done
in
a
timely
fashion,
and
that
leaves
little
time
for
leisurely,
super-contemplative,
emotionally
connective
writing.
And
I
completely
realize
this,
but
I
think
that
it
has
been
only
this
past
year
that
IOve
really
accepted
it.
Yes,
IOve
learned
to
let
go
of
unrealistic
ideals.
ItOs
not
that
IOve
lowered
my
standards,
but
rather
IOve
become
more
open-minded
regarding
how
those
(still
high)
standards
are
achieved.
Being
a
WA
has
definitely
helped
me
in
this
respect,
because
IOve
had
the
chance
to
see
other
studentsO
writing
processes,
and
most
studentsO
processes
revolve
around
two
key
principles:
1)
Get
it
done.
2)
Get
it
done
fast.
Procrastination
seems
such
a
dirty
word;
I
prefer
the
term
selective
prioritizing.
But
itOs
trueNwork
often
gets
left
to
the
last
minute,
and
so
IOve
learned
not
to
be
hard
on
myself
when
this
happens.
Ideally,
I
like
to
get
my
work
done
well
in
advance,
but
with
so
many
demands
on
my
time,
this
is
extremely
hard
to
do.
So
IOve
become
adept
at
writing
quicklyNat
being
more
efficient
in
my
writing
and
really
focusing
on
the
task
at
hand.
And
without
sacrificing
quality,
which
is
sometimes
hard,
but
itOs
a
tightrope
walk
that
IOve
learned
to
walkNthe
trick
is
not
looking
down
or
looking
back,
not
second-guessing
myself,
but
going
confidently
forward
and
not
stopping
until
I
reach
the
other
side.
And
this
is
perhaps
the
greatest
lesson
IOve
taught
myself:
to
have
faith
in
my
abilities,
to
not
be
too
hard
on
myself,
and
to
not
get
so
caught
up
in
my
desire
for
good
grades
that
I
lose
perspective
and
lose
sight
of
the
Process.
And
just
for
those
who
might
be
curious,
step
one
of
the
Process
is
relax;
step
two
is
begin.
