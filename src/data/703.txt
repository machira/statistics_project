Learning
through
Teaching:
How
I
Learned
NGoodO
Writing
through
Successful
Conferences
As
a
veteran
Writing
Associate
(WA),
I
have
had
a
full
year
to
reflect
on
the
exciting
and
demanding
tasks
associated
with
my
position.
Almost
one
year
ago,
I
was
training
to
be
a
WA
and
was,
quite
candidly,
nervous
for
my
forthcoming
assignments.
During
the
WA
training
session,
I
was
anxiously
scribbling
notes
about
how
to
conduct
a
conference.
A
plethora
of
questions
raced
through
my
mind:
Nwhat
do
I
say
to
the
student?O
NDo
I
douse
the
studentOs
document
in
red
ink
or
do
I
not
make
any
markings
at
all?O
Most
importantly,
however,
I
wanted
to
know
to
how
hold
a
successful
conference.
Admittedly,
at
that
time
I
did
not
know
what
a
NsuccessfulO
conference
was.
I
assumed
that
when
the
conference
ended,
the
student
had
an
improved
paper
and
eventually
received
a
better
grade
than
if
the
student
had
not
met
with
in
the
first
place.
Interestingly
enough,
it
would
not
be
what
I
learned
in
the
training
session
(although
the
training
session
helped
to
answer
my
former
two
questions),
but
my
experiences
in
different
conferences
with
students
and
meetings
with
my
partner
professors
that
would
contribute
to
my
understanding
of
a
successful
conference.
My
journey
to
recreating
my
notion
of
a
successful
conference
began
with
my
first
partner
professor
conference
just
before
the
start
of
school
a
year
ago.
When
I
walked
through
Professor
TiernanOs
door
and
sat
down
in
his
office,
I
was
utterly
unaware
of
the
enlightening
impact
of
our
exchange.
After
discussing
a
few
assignment
basics
and
outlining
the
syllabus,
we
then
ventured
into
a
discussion
on
his
definition
of
what
he
called
NgoodO
and
NbadO
writing.
After
our
profound
and
informative
dialogue,
I
came
to
a
ground-breaking
conclusion:
professors
of
different
academic
disciplines
have
alternating
(and,
at
times,
contradicting)
views
of
NgoodO
and
NbadO
writing.
A
history
professor,
for
example,
might
see
NgoodO
writing
as
effective
historical
recounting
with
a
goal
of
entertaining
the
reader.
An
English
or
Political
Science
professor
may
view
NgoodO
writing
as
a
valuable
means
of
advancing
academic
discourse
or
transcending
an
academic
discussion
to
novel
heights.*
Although
retrospectively
my
conclusion
seems
obvious,
at
the
time
it
was
insightful
and
proved
that
not
every
essay
needs
to
follow
the
five
paragraphs,
clear
thesis
formula.
In
fact,
one
needs
to
dissect
the
assignment
and
analyze
the
professorOs
instructions
in
order
to
compose
a
well
written
piece.
The
meeting
with
my
partner
professor
provided
me
with
one
essential
tool
to
holding
a
successful
conference:
thoroughly
breaking
down
the
assignment
and
finding
the
professorOs
intentions.
In
other
words,
a
student
should
ask,
Nwhy
did
my
professor
give
me
this
assignment
and
what
was
my
professor
hoping
to
accomplish
in
doing
so?O
After
the
meeting
I
felt
more
confident
going
into
my
first
round
of
conferences,
but
I
was
still
unsure
if
my
conferences
would
be
successful.
In
order
to
ensure
that
the
students
fully
understood
the
assignment,
before
the
first
round
of
conferences,
I
met
with
the
students
briefly
to
discuss
the
project
and
what
Professor
Tiernan
expected
of
the
students.**
One
of
my
first
conferences
would,
however,
greatly
add
to
my
understanding
of
a
successful
conference.
The
student
with
whom
I
met
had
a
well
written
paper
in
terms
of
grammar,
punctuation
and
syntax,
but
was
missing
a
very
important
componentNan
argumentative
edge.
When
I
began
explaining
to
this
student
that
he
was
missing
a
main
argument
or
an
intriguing
point
of
contention,
he
did
not
completely
understand.
He
had
thought
that
the
assignment
was
to
simply
recall
a
historical
incident
and
describe
its
significance.
Although
that
was
the
bulk
of
the
assignment,
the
student
had
failed
to
advance
the
essay
to
the
next
levelNwhy
was
the
historical
event
significant?
When
the
student
can
answer
the
NwhyO
question,
then
that
student
can
contribute
something
interesting
to
the
academic
discourse
of
the
historical
topic
and
can
advance
that
academic
dialogue
in
some
way.
To
explain
this
to
the
student,
however,
was
a
relatively
daunting
task.
I
had
to
delve
into
the
basics
of
argumentative
writing
and
explain
how
an
essay
is
designed
to
persuade
an
individual
to
understand
(or
believe)
a
certain
point
of
view.
Although
the
conference
lasted
nearly
50
minutes,
it
was
by
far
one
of
the
most
gratifying
and
successful
conferences
we
shared.
After
that
conference,
I
felt
I
had
two
core
components
of
conducting
a
successful
conference:
helping
the
students
to
gather
a
thorough
and
complete
understanding
of
the
assignment
and
enabling
the
students
to
write
something
argumentative
that
contributes
to
academic
discourse.
It
would
only
be
a
matter
of
time
before
I
would
fully
grasp
the
definition
of
a
successful
conference.
Soon
thereafter
I
would
understand
that
it
would
not
be
a
single
incident
(like
my
prior
two
experiences),
but
a
compilation
of
conferences
that
would
contribute
to
my
understanding
of
a
successful
conference.
I
learned
that
a
conference
does
not
need
to
be
exactly
30
minutes.
Simply
enough,
I
do
not
finish
the
conference
if
the
student
has
any
qualms
about
anything
assignment
related.
On
the
contrary,
if
the
studentOs
draft
looks
well-developed
and
the
student
feels
confident,
then
a
conference
could
only
last
20
minutes.
The
fact
of
the
matter
is
a
conference
is
not
successful
until
both
the
student
and
I
feel
confident
that
the
piece
we
were
working
on
will
become
a
polished
product
of
convincing
academic
prose.
After
the
first
semester
as
a
WA,
I
felt
significantly
more
comfortable
with
my
knowledge
of
successful
conferences.
I
sensed
that
for
a
conference
to
be
successful
it
needs
three
important
aspects:
1)
a
pre-conference
explanation
and
detailing
of
the
assignment
and
the
professorOs
intentions,
2)
the
student
must
know
what
his
or
her
argument
is
and
have
a
means
of
advancing
the
academic
discourse
of
the
topic
and
3)
the
student
and
I
must
be
confident
in
his
or
her
product
and
the
student
must
be
excited
enough
with
the
work
to
submit
the
assignment
with
no
hesitations.
Following
this
regiment,
I
have
found,
leads
to
more
respect
and
trust
between
myself
and
the
student
and
more
successful
conferences
down
the
road.
The
method
that
I
employ
plays
out
interestingly,
I
should
note,
during
WA
Drop-In.
Most
of
the
time,
with
my
experience,
the
student
fails
to
bring
the
assignment
and
I
need
to
inquire
as
to
the
details
of
the
assignment.
In
order
to
make
up
for
the
lack
of
an
assignment
and
still
ensure
a
successful
conference,
however,
I
need
to
go
line-by-line
in
the
studentOs
paper,
highlight
or
underline
some
main
points
of
argument
or
interesting
details
and
ask
the
student
how
those
specific
statements
relate
to
the
assignment.
If
that
student
replies
NI
donOt
know,O
or
NI
just
put
that
in
there
because
itOs
interesting,O
I
usually
advise
omitting
that
statement
or
altering
it
in
some
way
to
fit
the
assignment.
Especially
when
it
comes
to
Drop-In
essays,
every
line
should
have
a
specific
purpose
that
relates
to
the
assignment.
When
a
student
throws
in
sentences
that
do
not
pertain
to
the
assignment,
they
simply
dilute
the
argument
and
bring
their
essay
further
away
from
answering
the
assignment
completely
and
effectively.
Therefore,
it
is
necessary
to
do
this
in-depth,
line-by-line
analysis
(especially
in
Drop-In)
so
that
both
the
student
and
I
get
a
better
understanding
of
the
assignment
and
the
argument
in
place.
Understanding
how
to
run
a
successful
conference
has
had
a
positive
ancillary
impact
on
my
writing
too.
When
I
receive
an
assignment
from
a
professor,
I
use
the
same
techniques
and
give
myself
a
WA
conference
of
my
own.
Now,
when
I
receive
an
assignment,
I
usually
read
through
it
several
times,
highlighter
in
hand,
to
capture
the
most
important
parts
and
try
to
uncover
the
professorOs
meaning
for
giving
us
the
assignment.
Then,
I
usually
create
a
detailed
outline.
The
first
thing
I
put
on
the
top
of
my
outline
is
a
statement
or
two
on
where
I
want
to
go
with
the
essay,
what
my
argumentative
motives
are
or
how
I
wish
to
advance
the
academic
dialogue
in
some
way.
Finally,
I
write
a
piece
in
which
I
feel
comfortable
and
confident.
In
other
words,
depending
on
the
length
and
magnitude
of
the
assignment,
I
begin
writing
early
enough
so
I
have
adequate
time
to
print
out
my
draft,
mark
up
the
hard
copy
and
make
the
necessary
adjustments.
Once
this
is
completed,
I
read
over
my
final
draft
several
times
until
I
feel
confident
that
I
have
completed
the
assignment
to
the
best
of
my
ability.
To
be
completely
honest,
I
probably
would
not
have
adopted
that
meticulous
method
of
revision
if
I
did
not
see
it
work
so
well
with
my
students.
In
other
terms,
being
a
WA
has
helped
the
students
I
work
with
just
as
much
as
it
has
helped
me.
Today,
as
I
compose
this
narrative,
I
am
greatly
looking
forward
to
another
exciting
semester
of
being
a
WA
because
there
is
always
room
for
improvement.
In
a
mere
two
semesters
I
accomplished
an
incredible
amount
with
my
own
writing
and
I
feel
as
though
I
have
improved
the
writing
of
dozens
of
young
intellects.
This
coming
semester,
I
will
look
for
new
methods,
new
techniques
and
novel
concepts
which
I
can
add
to
my
concoction
called
Nsuccessful
conference.O
With
another
semester
on
the
horizon,
I
earnestly
anticipate
my
next
assignment
so
I
can
continue
to
improve
my
conferences
and,
in
turn,
my
writing
as
well.
*Of
course,
a
history
professor,
English
professor
and
Political
Science
professor
may
see
NgoodO
writing
in
the
same
light,
the
point
is
that
based
on
my
discussion
with
Professor
Tiernan
and
my
experience
with
other
professors,
I
became
aware
of
noticeable
differences
in
how
NgoodO
writing
is
perceived
amongst
professors.
**It
turned
out
that
meeting
with
the
students
as
a
whole
prior
to
the
individual
conferences
became
an
essential
part
of
the
writing
process.
Based
on
student
feedback,
the
students
felt
more
confident
with
their
first
drafts
and
were
able
to
write
their
papers
a
lot
easier
than
simply
interpreting
the
assignment
themselves.
