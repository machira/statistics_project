Project
for
Workshop
Writing
Like
a
WA
Fall
2000
Earlier
this
summer,
I
attended
a
celebration
for
my
Grandfather's
80
birthday.
One
of
Grandpop's
gifts
was
a
compilation
of
letters
from
each
of
his
55
grandchildren,
or
at
least
from
the
ones
that
were
capable
of
holding
a
writing
tool,
whether
it
be
a
pen
or
crayon.
Upon
arrival
at
the
gala,
cousins
congregated
abuzz
with
"Did
you
write
your
letter?"
and
"What
did
you
write?"
My
cousin
Lynne
unconfidently
approached
me
with
her
letter.
"Does
this
sound
good?"
she
asked.
I
immediately
grabbed
a
pen
and
began
to
read
it
over.
I
corrected
her
lack
of
verb
and
subject
agreement
and
explained
to
her
the
mistake.
Even
before
my
cousins
began
to
tease
me
I
stopped
slightly
horrified,
"When
did
I
become
this
-
this
freak?!"
The
Quiz
We
Love
to
Hate
One
of
the
contributions
in
my
progression
to
freakhood
is
definitely
the
dreaded
grammar
quiz.
The
most
obvious
thing
that
I
can
say
about
the
grammar
quizzes
is
that
they
are
extremely
annoying
and
tend
to
evoke
nightmarish
visions
of
the
blazer-ripping
(because
she
held
a
boy
up
by
his)
Sister
Mary
Berryman.
However,
you
would
be
incorrect
in
concluding
that
the
previous
sentence
describes
my
rather
complicated
relationship
with
the
quizzes.
Prior
to
the
first
grammar
quiz,
much
of
the
terminology
from
the
"20
Most
Common
Surface
Errors"
was
not
too
familiar
to
me.
This
is
not
because
I
never
learned
the
jargon,
but
due
to
lack
of
use
I
had
forgotten
much
of
it.
Unfortunately,
after
the
first
quiz,
this
new
information
was
once
again
flushed
down
the
toilet
bowl
of
my
brain
with
much
of
the
other
information
I
learned
that
semester
in
college.
Fortunately,
that
was
not
the
last
grammar
quiz
for
me.
After
the
second
quiz,
the
information
stuck
and
it
was
as
if
I
had
been
born
saying
phrases
like
"nonrestrictive
clause."
You
may
wonder
why
I
have
focused
on
terminology
when
discussing
the
grammar
quizzes.
Maybe
you
are
thinking
something
like,
"Big
deal,
I
can
sing
La
Bamba,
but
that
doesn't
mean
I
am
fluent
in
Spanish."
Well,
for
me,
years
of
reading
and
writing
had
made
the
rules
of
grammar
almost
automatic.
Most
grammar
mistakes
just
sounded
wrong
to
me.
However,
this
was
not
much
help
when
instructing
students
on
common
errors.
Learning
the
terminology
forced
me
to
clarify
what
the
mistake
is,
why
it
is
a
mistake,
and
how
to
fix
it.
The
grammar
quizzes,
although
undeniably
irksome,
better
equipped
me
to
teach
my
students.
My
Advice
Here
are
some
of
the
things
that
I
learned
this
past
year
about
writing,
WA-ing,
and
life
in
general.
1.
Try
to
be
as
original
as
possible.
For
one
assignment
a
professor
has
to
read
about
20
papers.
This
can
get
very
monotonous.
Different
can
be
very
refreshing.
2.
In
trying
to
be
original,
do
not
forget
to
address
the
assignment.
The
professor
may
appreciate
your
originality,
but
all
it
will
get
you
is
a
pat
on
the
back
if
it
has
no
relevance
to
the
assignment.
3.
In
a
conference,
do
not
take
a
student's
negative
attitude
personally.
A
student
"Fred"
calls
me
up
and
says,
"Yeah,
uh,
you're
my
WA
and
I
wasn't
going
to
meet
with
you
just
on
principle,
but
I
can't
afford
to
lose
the
three
points
that
the
professor
will
take
off
my
grade."
The
conference
went
just
as
well.
Looking
back,
I
may
have
been
able
to
make
it
work
better
if
I
had
been
less
offended
by
his
attitude.
Better
yet,
I
could
have
proved
his
theory
on
WAs
wrong.
Note:
this
advice
is
also
valuable
for
waitresses.
4.
Do
not
be
afraid
of
silence
in
a
conference.
I
learned
this
at,
of
all
places,
a
staff
meeting.
Whenever
I
would
ask
a
student
a
question
in
a
conference
and
she
could
not
answer
relatively
soon,
I
would
prompt
her
with
clues.
What
I
thought
was
helping
was
actually
breaking
up
a
student's
concentration.
I
assumed
that
the
student
would
be
embarrassed
for
not
knowing
the
answer,
but
I
probably
just
felt
uncomfortable
in
the
silence.
A
WA's
prolonged
silence
after
asking
a
question
increases
the
productivity
of
the
student.
5.
The
little
things
Always
brush
your
teeth.
Never
use
the
elevator
in
Pardee
when
you
are
late
(of
course
you
can
still
blame
your
lateness
on
the
elevator).
Remember
materials
and
a
pen
for
staff
meetings.
Relax.
A
Return
to
the
Beginning
This
semester
I
will
be
working
with
Professor
Hochman's
FYS.
I
am
extremely
excited
to
work
with
this
professor
because
he
has
had
a
tremendous
influence
on
my
life.
I
feel
that
I
will
be
able
to
relate
very
well
to
these
students.
As
a
scared
freshman,
I
took
the
same
FYS.
And,
that
class
was
my
first
introduction
to
the
WA
program.
I
enjoyed
my
WA
(Steve
Mathe)
so
much
that
I
decided
to
become
one
myself.
I
must
admit
that
my
desire
was
not
enough
motivation
because
it
took
the
coaxing
of
a
particular
English
professor
to
actually
make
me
one.
As
I
enter
my
final
year
as
a
WA,
I
feel
more
confident.
Everything
has
seemed
to
come
full
circle.
This
is
going
to
be
a
good
year.
