Writing
My
Way
Did
I
write
in
elementary
school?
Uhhhh
.
.
.my
mother
has
saved
many
of
my
construction
paper
bound
works.
An
entire
file
cabinet.
What
is
there
to
say
about
my
grade
school
stories?
I
was
creative.
Yeah
.
.
.that's
it.
My
writing
was
detailed,
colorful
and
original.
As
I
reread
my
stories
from
second
grade,
I
clearly
remember
weekly
writing
assignments.
One
of
my
favorites
is
the
short
story
I
called,
"Tom
T.
Turkey:
The
day
after
Thanksgiving,"
and
this
is
the
rarely
seen,
unedited
version:
Once
apon
a
time
ther
lived
a
Turkey
named
Tom.
One
day
a
hunter
shout
him.
When
he
got
home
his
wive
fixed
him
up
for
Thanksgiving
dinner.
After
dinner
Tom
felt
like
he
had
only
bones
and
headless
and
beakless
and
eyeless.
Then
his
wive
therow
him
in
the
trash.
Then
he
felt
ded.
The
end
of
Tom
T.
turkey.
This
piece
clearly
has
as
a
beginning,
middle,
and
end--and
in
retrospect,
I
am
surprised
at
the
attention
to
detail
in
this
story.
Specifically,
how
the
narrator
articulates
Tom
Turkey's
feelings
of
"headless
and
beakless
and
eyeless."
This
was
one
of
my
first
attempts
at
story
writing;
however,
it
was
far
from
my
last.
Later
in
the
same
year
I
penned
a
story
called,
"The
Cat
From
Space:"
Once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
girl
named
Katie
and
she
had
a
blond
head.
She
wears
dress
all
the
time.
And
one
day
a
ship
landed
in
her
backyard.
It
the
ship
it
had
a
cat.
The
cat
looked
like
a
Green
monster
with
antennas.
First
he
ate
my
toys.
Then
he
wanted
water.
So
I
gave
him
some.
The
he
was
sleepy
so
he
selp
on
my
bed.
When
he
got
up
he
ate
my
bed.
Because
he
was
sick.
So
I
gave
him
a
cat
pill.
After
he
ate
the
cat
pill
he
felt
good.
When
he
go[t]
up
he
wanted
to
go
outside.
When
he
got
outside
he
chased
the
dog
the
was
so
scard
he
ran
in
side.
When
he
got
inside
he
jumped
in
my
arms.
So
he
wanted
to
go
home
so
I
helped
him
fix
his
space
ship.
So
he
went
home.
The
End
But
wait,
I
know
what
everyone
is
thinking.
My
writing
career
wasn't
diverse
enough,
I
only
wrote
short
stories.
While
I
haven't
written
a
novel
to
date,
I
must
admit
that
I
dabbled
in
poetry
once
in
awhile.
Hey,
I
even
tackled
limericks
in
the
sixth
grade,
frog
limericks
to
be
exact:
There
once
was
a
frog
named
Sally,
A
cheerleader
at
a
pep
rally
She
jumped
and
she
cheered,
But
just
as
she
feared
The
fans
kicked
her
into
the
alley.
While
I
cannot
honestly
say
that
I
wrote
that
limerick
all
by
myself,
I
can
say
that
the
maternal
influence
during
its
production
was
minimal.
I
think
this
limerick
possesses
the
same
creative
flavor
apparent
in
my
elementary
school
writing.
There
is
a
short
story
in
this
five-line
limerick,
I
don't
just
give
facts,
but
characters
change
(much
like
Tom
the
Turkey).
Sally
is
established
as
a
character
and
then
she
experiences
a
transformation
because,
ultimately,
her
peers
reject
her.
But
let's
move
on
to
the
moment
that
I
consider
the
beginning
of
my
career
as
a
writer.
Ahhh
...
I
fondly
remember
the
moment
that
I
consider
the
beginning
of
my
career
as
a
writer.
I
was
a
freshman
in
high
school,
in
boarding
school,
and
I
was
in
my
third
week
of
homesickness.
My
English
class
was
supposed
to
write
a
3-4
(!)
page
paper
about
our
summer
reading
experiences.
I
rushed
to
the
library
for
a
copy
of
Ethan
Frome
and,
honestly,
I
half
read
it.
But
my
creativity
remained
consistent,
instead
of
a
flat-toned
paper
in
which
I
attempted
to
sound
like
I
knew
what
the
hell
I
was
talking
about,
I
wrote
a
paper
in
which
the
reader
was
taken
back
and
forth
through
time.
Instead
of
studying
the
novel
in
retrospect,
I
outlined
how
I
read
the
book
.
.
.
Being
the
procrastinator
that
I
am,
only
50
pages
have
been
read
and
130
remain.
As
I
watch
MTV,
I
am
constantly
reminded
of
the
reading
I
have
left,
not
by
my
conscience,
but
by
a
superior
known
as
my
mother.
So
now
I
am
forced
to
leave
Beavis
and
Butthead
for
Ethan
and
Mattie
.
.
.
I
enjoy
the
tone
of
this
paper
because
it
attempted
to
draw
the
reader
into
the
narrator's
world
and
I
believe
it
was
successful,
especially
for
a
freshman
in
high
school.
It
started
out
deeply
sarcastic
and
negative,
but
there
is
no
need
to
fear
because
even
as
a
fourteen
year
old,
I
knew
that
the
narrator
(namely,
myself)
needed
to
change
or
develop
.
.
.
Now
things
have
changed.
My
mother
is
no
longer
forcing
me
to
read
Ethan
Frome.
I
stayed
up
until
12:00pm
avidly
reading
so
the
suspense
wouldn't
kill
me.
(I
even
read
through
Saturday
Night
Live.
Now
that
is
true
sacrifice.)
Do
you
want
to
know
what
happens?
I
could
be
mean
and
say
that
you
just
have
to
read
the
book,
but
I'm
not
that
type
of
person
.
.
.
Yet
I
didn't
realize
the
merits
of
my
writing
at
the
time
because
the
night
before
this
paper
was
due
I
sat
in
the
hallway
of
my
dorm
with
a
senior
girl
from
my
hall.
.
.crying.
This
wasn't
just
crying--this
was
suffocating,
painful,
deafening
sobs.
Why?
"because
m-m-m-y
pa-a-a-aper
su-u-u-cks."
But
in
retrospect,
it
didn't
suck.
For
my
first
high
school
writing
assignment,
it
was
coherent,
creative,
and,
frankly,
engaging.
In
my
sophomore
year
at
Culver
Girls
Academy,
I
didn't
like
my
accelerated
English
teacher
and
as
I
reread
my
papers
from
that
class
I
find
myself
with
little
to
say
about
them.
Therefore,
I
turn
to
my
eleventh
grade
year
and
Mrs.
Candy
Koehn's
(pronounced
cane)
English
class.
Perhaps
my
favorite
assignment
from
this
year
was
the
Macbeth
script
that
each
of
us
penned.
I
chose
to
enhance
2:2:37-52:
Lady
Macbeth:
Consider
it
not
so
deeply.
[Lady
Macbeth
turns
and
says
these
words
curtly
and
quick
in
a
powerful
voice.
Her
mouth
moves
violently
and
her
face
flashes
with
annoyance.
Emphasis
on
"it"
and
"so"
suggest
her
cold
nature
and
impatience
with
Macbeth's
worries.
Her
commanding
voice
and
movements
cause
Macbeth
to
turn
and
look
her
in
the
eye,
startled
by
her
sudden
response.
This
suggests
her
control
and
influence
over
Macbeth.
Gosh,
it
feels
like
something
is
missing
from
this
play
script--what
could
it
be?
I
know
.
.
.what
was
Lady
Macbeth
wearing?
Never
fear,
I
didn't
forget
about
costuming:
Lady
Macbeth
will
be
wearing
a
long
gown
of
crushed
velvet,
in
various
shades
of
red
so
deep
that
in
rich
light
they
appear
to
be
black.
The
velvet
cloth
of
which
her
gown
is
made
signifies
seduction
and
deception
because
of
its
appealing
texture
and
soft
glow.
The
crown
which
sits
upon
her
head
is
made
of
the
brightest
gold
with
a
single
ebony
stone
in
the
middle
of
her
forehead.
The
stone
itself
appears
to
be
an
eye,
gazing
upon
and
taking
in
all
that
happens,
implying
a
supernatural
force
embedded
in
Lady
Macbeth.
Quite
interesting.
I
will
be
the
first
to
admit
that
my
coherence
in
these
high
school
papers
was
sometimes
shaky
and
my
organization
needed
some
attention,
I
believe
that
my
writing
remained
colorful
and
creative.
Through
the
confusing
language,
jumbled
ideas,
and
(occasionally)
erroneous
proofreading,
I
believe
that
the
actual
writing
was
quite
perceptive.
I
see
the
beginnings
of
a
future
(maybe)
fairly
deep
thinker
as
I
examine
this
old
portfolio.
Creative
writing
for
a
creative
writer
.
.
.it
was
obvious
that
this
narrative
was
eventually
going
to
discuss
a
creative
writing
class.
Of
course
I
took
that
class,
my
first
semester
senior
year
of
high
school
to
be
exact.
The
teacher,
Mr.
Feldman,
was
a
patient
man
who
tolerated
his
students'
attempts
to
shock
him.
However,
my
favorite
short
story
from
this
stage
of
my
writing
career
was
about
a
place
called
Harry's
House
of
Hogs:
"How
about
Harry's
House
of
Hogs
for
dinner?
They've
got
pork
chops,
ham,
bacon
.
.
."
His
voice
trails
off
back
to
the
east,
as
he
stares
through
me
into
the
green
cloud
behind
my
head.
"That's
fine."
My
voice
agrees
for
me
because
my
mind
was
sitting
at
a
bus
station
somewhere
in
Tucson.
We
fly
through
the
Pristine
Valley
in
a
Bass
oxford;
the
tongue
is
out
handrail
and
the
shoestrings
our
seatbelts.
The
sky
grows
overcast
and
acid
rain
begins
to
fall,
singeing
my
hair
and
stripping
the
shoe
of
its
alligator
skin.
The
road
sign
reads:
Heaven-
next
right,
Harry
s-
2
miles
on
the
left.
"Why
don't
we
go
to
Heaven?"
I
beg
him
to
turn.
"No,
the
gate
lets
anyone
through
these
days."
As
he
continues
to
stare
through
me.
We
park
in
the
gravel
at
Harry's
and
tie
the
shoe
to
the
hitching
post.
We
are
seated
at
a
table
overlooking
a
waterfall
where
the
penguins
play.
They
gracefully
jump
over
the
three
hundred
foot
drop,
and
then
take
an
escalator
back
to
the
water's
summit.
Our
waiter
is
a
six-foot
Styrofoam
pig
wearing
a
red
bandana
around
his
neck
and
holding
a
pair
of
tongs
in
his
left
hoof.
He
brings
us
water
and
bread
in
a
slop
trough,
and
then
begins
to
recite
the
night's
specials,
"tonight
is
Carrie
night
at
Harry's,
and
at
no
extra
cost
to
the
customer
we
will
dump
a
vat
of
pig's
blood
on
one
lucky
table,
each
and
every
hour,
on
the
hour."
This
was
the
first
time
I
tackled
surrealism,
and
I
was
apparently
effective
because
after
I
was
coerced
into
reading
it
out
loud
in
class,
Mr.
Fledman
looked
at
me
and
said
in
a
soft
voice,
"Wow,
that
is
like
a
Dali
painting
on
paper."
In
retrospect,
I
have
to
agree--it
is
an
effective
surrealistic
piece.
And,
not
to
repeat
myself
again,
it
is
creative.
But
this
leads
us
to
college,
what
about
freshman
year?
Hmmm.
.
.
I
don't
really
remember
freshman
year--FYS
and
college
writing
are
blurs.
Nothing
really
spectacular
happened
to
me
that
year.
As
a
writer,
I
did
not
produce
anything
I
am
proud
of
or
inspired
by.
That
was
until
VAST
my
sophomore
year--I
had
a
section
that
I
didn't
have
many
expectations
for.
Well,
that's
not
true,
I
expected
it
to
be
boring
and
uninspiring
and
painful.
I
expected
to
hate
it.
I
couldn't
have
been
more
wrong.
This
class
resulted
in
some
of
my
best
writing.
I
would
write
thirteen
pages
when
only
7
were
assigned;
I
would
delve
into
more
depth
on
a
60-word
blackboard
posting
than
I
ever
attempted
in
the
past.
This
year
also
marked
my
first
publication,
in
the
VAST
essays
book.
But
I
don't
want
to
dwell
on
that
paper,
anyone
who
wants
to
read
it
more
than
likely
has
access
to
it.
However,
it
was
in
this
class
that
I
was
re-introduced
to
poetry.
For
my
final
project
I
wrote
a
series
of
poems
that
questioned
the
relationship
between
science
and
art:
because
science
hates
art:
Literature,
painting
&
poetry
are
swallowed
by
expensive
paraphernalia,
textbooks,
and
numbers
lab
rats
gnaw
away
at
aged
volumes
of
Shakespeare
and
Dickinson
and
Thoreau
And
I
am
left
feeling
like
Pavlov's
dogs,
who
are
in
the
laboratory
yelping
with
their
tails
tucked
between
their
legs.
Although
I
am
not
a
poetry
expert
and
I
have
not
written
poetry
since,
I
believe
that
these
stanzas
show
promise.
This
exercise
helped
me
creatively
express
my
distress
with
science
and
my
process
of
overcoming
this
fear.
The
closure
of
my
sophomore
year
brings
me
to
junior
year,
which
I
believe
was
my
most
creative
year
to
date.
The
writing
I
produced
in
several
of
my
classes,
I
remain
proud
of
and
inspired
by;
however,
the
piece
at
the
forefront
of
my
mind
is
my
45-page
paper
on
cow
tipping.
This
paper
attempted
to
explain
and
understand
the
belief
in
cow
tipping
and
its
repercussions
of
social
memory.
Here
is
a
particularly
memorable
passage
from
"Cow
Tipping:
Fact
or
'Udder'
Nonsense":
A
possible
reason
why
this
legend
persists
is
because
the
actual
sport
lies
not
in
tipping
a
cow,
but
rather
in
successfully
convincing
other
people
that
it
can
be
done
(whether
in
theory
or
practice).
In
other
words,
the
sport
of
cow
tipping
is
so
outrageous
that
most
people
do
not
seriously
consider
doing
it;
however,
it
is
entertaining
to
teach
the
cow-ignorant
people
about
cow
tipping
because
they
will
believe
it.
And
the
troublemaker
is
left
feeling
satisfied
that
he/she
just
deceived
someone
else.
While
this
passage
does
not
reflect
the
fun
element
of
this
paper,
it
does
(I
believe)
reflect
the
analytical
element
of
this
research
project.
In
this
paper,
I
was
able
to
take
an
offbeat
topic
and
turn
it
into
a
scholarly
discussion
on
popular
culture
social
memory.
It
has
only
been
recently
that
I
believe
I
have
been
able
to
use
my
creativity
more
effectively
in
analytical
writing,
which
I
believe
makes
long
papers
more
interesting
for
the
reader.
In
this
narrative
I
have
outlined
my
progression
from
short
stories
about
turkeys,
to
limericks
about
frogs,
and
term
papers
about
cow
tipping--yet
as
I
look
back
on
my
career
as
a
writer
I
can
only
really
say
that
one
thing
has
remained
consistent.
.
.my
creativity.
I
believe
that
over
the
years
my
writing
has
become
less
confused
and
jumbled,
but
nobody's
perfect.
Admittedly,
I
don't
think
I
will
ever
fully
understand
commas
and
I
tend
to
use
parentheses
(too)
liberally,
but
at
least
my
papers
are
fun
to
read.
