wrote
the
lines
of
her
address
over
and
over,
in
different
sizes,
colors,
and
styles:
squiggly
lines,
straight
lines,
big
spaces,
little
spaces.
It
was
like
the
small
four
year
old
had
finally
crossed
through
the
portal
that
welcomed
her
into
the
grown
up
world
and
separated
her
from
her
baby
sister
and
brothers.
After
she
wrote
her
address
down,
she
learned
her
telephone
number,
and
that
lead
to
all
the
names
in
RachelOs
family.
She
wrote
and
wroteE
and
wrote
and
wrote.
It
took
a
couple
of
years
to
realize
that
the
simple
little
girl
held
an
amazing
and
astounding
power.
One
day,
RachelOs
mom
dragged
the
restless
little
girl
to
her
job
and
sat
her
in
front
of
a
blank
computer
screen.
The
cursor
blinked
on
and
off,
on
and
off,
until
wanted
to
fall
asleep.
She
leaned
her
elbow
on
the
keyboard
and
suddenly
the
letters
R,
E,
and
D
appeared
on
the
screen.
Before
she
could
hit
the
backspace
key,
the
whole
room
turned
completely
red.
She
rubbed
her
eyes
long
and
hard,
and
when
she
opened
them,
the
room
was
still
a
magnificent
red.
Scared
that
she
had
done
something
wrong,
erased
the
letters,
and
the
room
transformed
back
to
its
original
color.
She
was
immediately
tickled
with
pleasure
towards
her
new
discovery;
what
more
could
she
do?
Before
that
thought
was
even
finished
in
her
mind,
she
began
pattering
at
the
keyboard.
She
typed
a
small
story
about
a
little
girl
who
wished
for
a
pink
unicorn
on
her
seventh
birthday,
and
her
mother
told
her
unicorns
were
not
real.
The
girl
was
very
upset
and
began
to
cry
when
suddenly,
a
pink
unicorn
stepped
into
her
house.
stopped
typing
for
a
moment
and
realized
that
a
pink
light
shone
in
the
distance.
She
saw
a
little
girl
with
blonde
ringlets
brushing
a
pink
unicorn
before
her
very
eyes.
squealed
with
delight
and
called
her
mother
into
the
room
so
she
could
experience
the
incredible
event.
When
her
mom
arrived,
pointed
towards
the
scene
in
front
of
them
and
smiled
at
her
mother.
Her
mom
asked
her
what
she
was
supposed
to
be
looking
at.
explained
that
there
was
a
girl
and
a
pink
unicorn
right
in
front
of
them.
RachelOs
mom
arched
her
eyebrows
and
then
looked
down
at
the
computer
screen.

into

room
to
finish
her
work.
finally
realizedN
she
was
the
only
person
who
could
see
her
powers.
Although
she
was
disappointed
that
she
could
not
show
off
her
gift,
she
was
thankful
to
have
it
regardless.
For
years,
she
watched
incredulously
as
her
words
came
to
life
and
no
matter
what
she
wrote
down,
it
bounced
off
of
her
paper
and
into
existence.
loved
stories
with
happy
endings
for
this
reason
because
she
never
wanted
to
watch
as
unfortunate
events
happened
to
her
beloved
characters.
One
fateful
day,
lost
her
power.
It
was
the
day
of
her
tenth
birthday,
and
received
a
cute
Hello
Kitty
diary.
Her
mom
told
her
she
could
write
down
things
that
happened
during
the
day,
secrets
that
she
wanted
to
share
but
did
not
want
to
tell
anyone,
and
poems
that
she
felt
like
composing
randomly.
It
was
exciting
for
the
girl
to
try
out
this
new
style
of
writing,
but
she
realized
that
the
fantastical
elements
were
no
longer
coming
to
life.
Instead
she
wrote
about
her
friends,
crushes
and
life
events;
those
things
did
not
need
to
magically
appear
because
they
were

Dear
Journal,
Today
I
found
out
that
I
won
an
essay
contest
for
VeteransO
Day.
Only
one
student
was
chosen
from
each
class,
and
the
committee
picked
me!
I
was
the
only
fourth
grader
to
win
so
this
really
feels
like
a
huge
honor.
I
wrote
about
my
dad
serving
in
the
air
force
for
many
years
and
how
that
has
impacted
my
life
in
positive
ways.
The
teacher
who
chose
my
essay
is
a
sixth
grade
teacher;
IOm
really
excited
that
she
liked
my
work.
In
other
news,
Jasmine
has
really
been
annoying
me
lately.
She
always
wants
to
play
with
my
Barbie
dolls,
but
I
think
IOm
too
old
for
that
now.
Love,
began
to
realize
that
she
wrote
more
than
most
of
her
classmates
did.
She
always
received
excellent
grades
in
English
class.
The
assignments
were
never
really
challenging,
and
she
was
anxious
to
find
new
ways
of
writing
and
possibly
discover
other
magical
powers
she
had.
One
day
at
school,
was
given
a
picture
of
a
mailbox.
Her
teacher
told
the
students
to
write
a
page
story
about
the
mailbox.
Ideas
flowed
through
RachelOs
head:
a
treasure
map
inside
the
mailbox,
a
kid
breaking
the
mailbox
with
a
baseball,
the
oldest
mailbox
in
the
country.
None
seemed
to
fit
this
very
specific
one.
Suddenly,
the
mailbox
grew
out
of
the
ground
of
the
classroom
floor
right
in
front
of
Rachel.
Her
eyes
became
wide
and
she
looked
around
to
see
if
anyone
else
had
noticed.
No
one
even
budged.
As
if
that
was
not
enough,
she
then
saw
a
small
little
kid
run
up
to
the
mailbox
and
jump
on
top
of
it.
Before
she
could
question
that
action,
the
mailbox
floated
up
and
then
went
soaring
into
the
sky.
Flying
mailboxesE
no.
Traveling
mailboxes.
She
titled
the
piece
of
paper
just
that,
and
then
went
into
a
story
about
a
boy
who
did
not
need
to
mail
letters
to
his
grandparents
who
lived
in
China;
he
just
needed
to
grab
hold
of
the
special
mailbox
and
it
transported
him
straight
there.
never
wanted
to
stop
writing
that
story,
but
she
quickly
realized
that
she
was
running
out
of
space
on
the
paper.
She
was
forced
to
give
it
an
ending.
Picture
prompts
became
her
new
favorite
form
of
writing
well
into
her
teenage
years.
She
loved
witnessing
a
small
2D
picture
transforming
into
a
full
scene
before
her
very
eyes.
The
crazier
the
story,
the
more
her
teachers
loved
it.
Whenever
had
to
write
persuasive
essays,
or
five
paragraph
essays,
her
words
fell
flat
on
the
paper.
There
was
no
life
to
them
because
they
were
not
real.
They
were
only
possible
situational
occurrences,
like
arguing
whether
the
school
should
issue
uniforms
or
if
the
cafeteria
should
use
plastic
instead
of
foam
plates.
She
was
good
at
manipulating
the
readerOs
opinion
and
believing
that
she
always
knew
best;
however,
the
words
did
not
give
her
goose
bumps.
She
never
felt
a
spark
in
her
fingers
or
a
twinge
in
her
brain
whenever
she
was
forced
to
do
research
papers.
This
was
not
writingN
it
couldnOt
be,
right?
Well,
it
wasnOt
until
her
English
teacher
in
12th
grade
proved
to
her
that
it
was.
Writing,
he
described,
was
an
art
in
any
format,
no
matter
what
the
subject.
He
handed
an
essay
from
The
New
Yorker
that
a
writer
wrote
all
about
commas.
CommasN
the
punctuation
mark
used
to
identify
breaks
in
the
words
of
a
sentence?
That
man
wrote
an
entire
essay
on
the
use
of
commas
and
it
wasE
magical.
It
was
beautiful.
His
diction
was
impressive;
his
syntax
was
superb.
He
made
want
to
watch
a
televised
broadcast
that
narrated
his
words;
they
were
that
interesting.
She
brought
these
feelings
she
was
experiencing
up
to
her
teacher
at
the
end
of
class,
and
he
asked
her
about
her
earliest
memory
of
her
writing.
He
said
the
words
she
wrote
were
probably
the
plainest
words
on
the
face
of
the
earth,
but
to
her
three
or
four
year
old
brain,
it
was
art.

streetE
it
finally
clicked.
From
that
lesson
on,
took
a
new
approach
to
writing.
It
was
not
what
a
person
wrote
that
was
enticingN
it
was
how
they
wrote
it.
It
was
the
experience
around
writing
it.
She
could
make
a
recipe
become
interesting
with
the
right
characters
and
plot
line.
noticed
that
her
words
were
not
forming
into
images
in
front
of
her
anymore;
instead
now,
the
images
were
appearing
through
the
letters,
in
between
the
paragraphs,
behind
the
plot
line.
Sometimes
the
passages
were
forming
several
images,
many
stories
within
a
couple
of
lines
of
poetry.
The
possibilities
of
creation
seemed
endless
through
the
new
techniques
that
was
constantly
learning
and
suddenly
RachelOs
world
was
not
so
clear
cut
anymore.
When
headed
to
college,
she
could
not
possibly
think
of
how
her
writing
could
take
on
even
more
new
forms.
She
knew
there
was
room
for
improvement,
but
her
knowledge
about
writing
forms
had
seemed
complete.
That
is,
until
she
read
the
short
story,
NHills
Like
White
ElephantsO
by
Hemingway.
She
read
through
it
once
and
had
no
idea
what
was
going
on.
A
couple
literally
had
an
entire
argument
but
never
said
the
main
thing
they
were
arguing
about.
It
was
so
incredibly
fascinating
that
it
became
her
mission
to
figure
out
what
the
argument
was
about.
There
were
hidden
clues
throughout
the
entire
story:
an
operation,
giving
and
taking
of
the
world,
drinking,
and
hills.
It
did
not
take
long
until
she
realized
that
the
entire
short
story
was
revolving
around
the
girl
having
an
abortion.
It
was
amazing
to
her
that
a
story
could
paint
an
entire
picture
around
a
main
subject
without
ever
mentioning
what
that
subject
was.
Once
she
made
this
discovery,
her
writing
once
again
took
a
drastic
turn.
understood
why
her
mother
could
not
see
the
pink
unicorn
when
she
was
a
little
girl,
even
though
she
desperately
wanted
to
show
her.
She
was
the
sole
author
of
that
piece
and
her
audience
would
see
whatever
she
wanted
them
to
see.
She
controlled
the
magic
in
their
minds;
she
manipulated
the
images
in
her
head.
also
realized
the
images
she
created
would
sometimes
be
perceived
in
different
ways
to
the
audience.
Even
though
she
would
specifically
describe
a
pink
unicorn
in
a
story
she
wrote,
that
unicorn
would
look
differently
in
everyoneOs
eyes.
Is
there
really
anything
more
beautiful
than
that?
Authors
had
the
power
of
creation,
learned;
however,
they
were
only
really
the
stepping
stone
towards
the
true
art
work.
From
crayon
to
keyboard,
RachelOs
journey
through
becoming
the
author
she
is
today
was
profound
and
important.
The
images
and
art
she
created
through
her
words
still
have
the
same
magic
for
her
now
that
they
did
when
she
was
a
child.
