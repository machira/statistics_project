Literacy
Narrative:
A
Second
Look
The
most
defining
moment
for
my
writing
in
the
past
year
came
early
during
the
fall
semester.
I
was
in
one
of
Professor
DonahueOs
300
level
English
courses.
I
think
the
subject
was
rhetoric,
but
my
memory
fails
me.
Either
way,
we
had
just
submitted
our
essays
on
Zen
&
the
Art
of
Motorcycle
Maintenance,
the
first
essays
of
the
course,
and
were
waiting
to
get
them
back.
Getting
your
first
assignment
back
is
pretty
big
deal
in
a
course,
because
it
gives
you
a
clue
as
to
how
the
rest
of
the
semester
is
going
to
go.
The
OclueO
that
Donahue
gave
us
was
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
semester
of
serious-business
writingNthe
whole
lot
was
deemed
unworthy
of
gradebook
entry.
The
lesson
plan
was
changed
to
an
emergency
writing
workshop.
She
expounded
her
principles
of
quality
college
writing
for
fifty
minutes,
laying
down
rules
for
introductions,
conclusions,
tenses,
thesis
statements,
textual
support,
and
a
slew
of
other
things.
A
lot
of
it
sounded
familiar
to
me,
but
some
was
totally
foreign.
For
instance,
she
claimed
that
a
fourth
of
a
typical
collegiate
English
essay
should
be
textual
citation.
It
sounded
like
an
obscene
amount
to
me,
a
guy
who
typically
got
by
on
a
few
well
chosen
lines
here
and
there
or
a
block
quote
if
I
needed
some
space.
There
are
some
good
arguments
for
it,
though.
Relevant,
frequent
citations
deeply
grounds
your
writing
in
its
topic
and
provides
authority
on
multiple
levels:
first,
by
showing
that
youOve
done
your
research
and,
second,
by
substantiating
your
argument
with
evidence.
This
lesson
was
unlike
most
English
classes,
in
that
hard
rules
were
being
laid
down
for
a
practice
that
we
like
to
think
of
as
free
flowing.
The
truth
of
the
matter
is,
though,
that
there
are
right
ways
to
go
about
writing
a
collegiate
level
paper
and
there
are
wrong
ways
to
do
it.
You
can
get
creative
as
you
like,
but
if
you
stray
off
topic,
for
instance,
youOre
making
a
mistake.
As
I
said
in
my
last
narrative,
my
favorite
experiences
in
English
classes
always
come
when
a
teacher,
in
a
moment
of
frustration
with
his
studentOs
incompetence,
tosses
aside
the
niceties
that
weOve
become
accustomed
to
in
an
English
class
and
unapologetically
explains
what
is
good
writing
and
what
is
not.
IOve
had
this
kind
of
lesson
three
times
in
my
life
now,
and
each
time
it
has
helped
my
writing
more
than
an
entire
course
of
generic
feel-good
English.
Unsurprisingly,
I
ate
DonahueOs
lecture
up.
I
even
took
notes,
which
is
a
true
rarity
for
me.
The
biggest
effects
that
its
had
on
my
writing
has
been
an
increased
respect
for
citation.
This
respect
has
reshaped
my
writing
process.
I
used
to
begin
in
the
middle
of
my
paper,
work
my
way
toward
the
end,
then
go
back
and
fill
in
the
beginning,
and,
finally,
fill
in
the
introduction
and
then
write
a
conclusion.
A
very
strange
processNI
am
awareNbut
it
helped
me
jump
the
difficult
hurdle
of
starting
an
essay
because
I
never
needed
to
know
where
it
was
ending.
I
could
write
and
see
where
I
ended
up,
fashioning
my
introduction
and
conclusion
to
fit
whatever
argument
I
made
and
going
back
to
fill
in
the
gaps
in
the
body
that
this
disjointed
process
tends
to
create.
I
still
find
this
an
effective
method
in
writing
non-research
driven
essays.
When
citation
are
involved,
I
now
begin
with
a
massive
text
hunt,
where
I
try
to
find
all
the
text
that
I
will
needed
to
fashion
an
essay.
I
recognize
that
this
is
probably
a
no-brainer
for
many,
many
writers,
and
IOm
sort
of
wondering
why
I
didnOt
figure
this
out
sooner,
because
itOs
extremely
efficient.
With
text
in
front
of
me,
IOm
usually
able
to
craft
a
tentative
thesis
that
guides
my
writing.
Other
than
that,
I
still
like
to
dive
into
the
middle
and
work
my
way
from
there.
Some
habits
donOt
change.
If
any
major
ideological
shift
has
taken
place
in
my
look
on
writing,
itOs
that
IOve
become
more
authoritarian
when
it
comes
to
academic
writing
(though
to
me,
the
NrulesO
IOve
adopted
feel
more
like
correct
writing
than
an
obnoxious
dictator,
infringing
on
my
literary
rights).
I
like
adhering
to
convention
and
writing
essays
in
a
disciplined,
efficient
fashion.
I
feel
like
there
is
a
large
misunderstanding
of
what
freedom
of
style
means.
WeOre
all
allowed
to
write
with
a
distinct,
personal
voice,
but
freedom
of
style
doesnOt
mean
anything
goes,
though
many
people
try
to
use
it
as
an
excuse
for
lazy
writing.
I
know
many
people
who
claim
that
citations
arenOt
for
themNthey
like
writing
what
they
think,
not
what
someone
else
thinks.
As
an
expectation
of
the
genre,
though,
a
refusal
to
embrace
citations
dooms
a
paper
to
mediocrity,
if
not
failure.
When
it
comes
to
drawing
authority
as
a
WA,
I
put
my
writing
principles
on
a
leash.
Having
fixed
definitions
of
right
and
wrong
is
a
confrontational
stance
that
I
wish
to
avoid.
Instead,
I
try
to
let
sound
advice
generate
my
authority.
This
is
a
slow
approach,
though,
since
it
requires
trust.
Fortunately
for
us,
the
WA
position
labels
you
as
a
person
who
probably
knows
how
to
write
well,
so
as
long
as
you
arenOt
actively
showing
that
you
donOt
know
what
youOre
doing,
student
writers
tend
to
have
faith
in
you:
authority
exists,
at
first,
through
reputation.
You
need
only
not
sully
your
name,
and
it
will
stay.
I
found
this
to
be
an
enormous
help
during
my
first
conferences,
as
I
stumbled
my
way
to
competence
through
trial
and
error.
As
much
as
the
first-day
WA
workshop
teaches
you
about
tricks
of
the
trade,
tricks
is
all
it
leaves
you
with.
Figuring
out
how
youOre
going
to
help
a
given
student
with
a
specific
paper
falls
to
you.
My
first
student
conference
was
a
disaster.
Going
into
the
meeting,
I
didnOt
know
what
I
was
going
to
do
much
other
than
Otalk
about
writingO
(the
student
hadnOt
relayed
her
essay
to
me
beforehand,
so
thatOs
about
as
specific
a
game
plan
as
I
could
dream
up
at
that
point).
I
donOt
remember
too
much
about
the
paper
other
than
that
I
saw
lots
of
ways
to
improve
the
writing,
but
knew
how
to
communicate
only
a
few.
As
a
result,
I
got
a
student
who
did
a
lot
of
smiling
&
nodding
as
I
clumsily
explained
concepts
that
I
had
known
for
some
time
but
never
had
had
instance
to
verbalize..
I
can
look
back
now
and
see
that
there
were
a
lot
of
elements
in
place
that
would
make
that
meeting
a
tough
one
by
default,
but
I
didnOt
know
all
that
then,
so
it
rattled
me.
Teaching
is
not
as
easy
as
knowing
the
material,
I
was
reminded.
Communication
is
a
second,
equally
important,
part
of
the
process,
and
one
I
had
little
luck
with
in
my
first
go-around.
My
first
meeting
was
a
mess,
surely,
but
I
was
able
to
think
of
ways
to
improve.
SoE
not
a
total
loss.
My
next
conference
went
a
lot
better.
Having
gotten
the
paper
ahead
of
time,
I
made
a
mental
agenda
of
the
things
I
wanted
to
go
over.
With
preparation,
I
was
able
to
deliver
them
in
a
coherent
way.
The
student
seemed
pleased.
I
was
pleased.
Everyone
was
pleased.
My
first
round
of
conferences
was
rough
at
points,
but
it
gave
me
the
experience
to
get
over
the
hump,
communication,
that
impeded
my
success.
From
that
point
on,
conferences
became
very
easy.
Yes,
there
was
the
oddball
here
and
there
that
would
throw
me,
but
those
are
always
the
most
helpful
in
learning
how
to
improve
as
a
WA.
To
a
new
WA,
I
would
say
that
most
of
our
work
is
tied
up
in
a
paperOs
thesis
statement,
so
if
youOre
wondering
where
to
focus
your
efforts,
thatOs
the
place
to
start.
A
good
paper
is
one
with
a
relevant
thesis
statement
that
is
supported
at
all
times
throughout.
Some
of
the
essays
that
come
into
the
writing
room
are
an
aimless
collection
of
ideas,
unaware
that
they
should
be
any
other
way.
These
are
the
essays,
by
my
estimation,
that
the
college
writing
program
was
made
for.
Many
of
the
problems
a
struggling
writer
has
comes
in
the
thesis
statement.
Either
not
knowing
that
most
collegiate
papers
should
be
guided
by
a
single
argument,
not
realizing
that
their
argument
strays
off
topic
at
points,
or
choosing
an
argument
that
does
not
address
the
assignmentOs
prompt
can
cause
what
would
otherwise
be
a
decent
paper
to
fall
flat.
These
are
all
very
easy
fixes
to
help
a
writer
make
and
are
common
enough
that
it
is
surprising
to
not
see
some
sort
of
thesis
issue
arise
in
the
papers
of
even
talented
writers.
As
for
the
upcoming
academic
year,
I
see
myself
taking
my
own
advice
and
honing
in
on
thesis
statements
to
the
utmost.
As
for
the
aforementioned
authoritarian
shift,
I
donOt
think
it
will
have
a
major
impact.
I
was
already
on
that
end
of
the
spectrum
last
year,
and
found
out
that
itOs
a
lot
easier
to
think
NWe
should
facilitate
learning
by
being
more
direct
in
guiding
our
studentsNenough
of
these
veiled
suggestions
and
this
feel
good
approach!,O
than
to
tell
some
poor
guy
that
his
rambling,
unsupported
essay
is
incorrect
and
requires
a
fundamental
overhaul.
For
me,
itOs
the
best
way
to
learn,
but
I
can
see
it
ruffling
more
than
a
few
feathers.
As
it
stands,
IOm
thinking
IOll
stick
with
CWPOs
method,
tried
and
true.
