Returning
WA
essay
How
should
I
go
about
explaining
my
recent
year
as
a
WA?
Many
things
come
to
mind
all
at
once,
making
it
quite
difficult
to
arrange
them
into
a
coherent
essay.
Then
again,
that
is
really
what
my
whole
year
has
been
about.
Last
year
I
was
a
WA
Nrookie.O
I
went
into
conferences
with
marked
up
drafts
and
a
clear
plan
in
mind
as
to
what
I
would
say
and
how
my
writer
would
respond.
And
as
the
saying
goes,
the
best
made
plans
of
mice
and
men
(and
WAs)
often
go
awry.
I
found
myself
flustered
at
times
when
students
would
not
follow
my
advice
or
worse,
students
outright
disagreeing
with
my
advice.
I
resolved
that
this
year
would
be
different,
but
I
wasnOt
quite
sure
how
I
was
going
to
accomplish
this
feat.
I
have
to
be
honestNmy
answer
came
not
in
the
form
of
a
book
or
reading
on
writing
conferences,
but
rather
in
the
form
of
my
assignment
for
the
fall
semester.
I
was
assigned
to
my
advisor.
A
man
whom
IOd
already
had
for
a
class
and
whom
IOd
also
be
a
lab
assistant
for
in
the
same
semester.
So
I
not
only
knew
his
demeanor
inside
the
classroom,
but
out
as
well.
We
were
both
excited
about
the
opportunity
to
work
together.
Dr.
Leibel
knew
that
I
was
knowledgeable
in
evolutionary
biology
so
I
wouldnOt
be
completely
confused
by
the
subject
matter
of
the
assignments.
The
fact
that
I
have
also
written
more
scientific
papers
in
his
class
would
ensure
that
the
students
would
receive
very
specific
help
on
style
and
how
to
present
the
facts
in
their
papers.
My
first
round
of
conferences
went
well,
but
a
problem
arose
in
the
second
round.
One
student,
not
a
native
English
writer,
sort
of
completed
the
assignment,
but
spent
the
first
few
pages
of
the
paper
talking
about
God
and
how
evolution
wasnOt
really
possible.
When
I
read
the
paper
I
was
confounded.
I
didnOt
even
know
where
to
begin.
I
knew
better
than
to
try
to
argue
with
him
that
evolution
exists.
People
cling
heavily
to
their
beliefs,
no
matter
what
evidence
is
presented
to
the
contrary.
Yet
the
assignment
was
to
talk
about
evolution
in
regards
to
class
readings
and
movies.
There
seemed
to
be
no
way
for
me
to
solve
this
contradiction.
I
spoke
to
different
WAs
but
was
reluctant
to
go
to
the
professor
just
yet.
Instead
I
turned
to
Prof.
Seetch.
She
suggested
that
I
talk
about
the
paper
to
the
student
in
terms
of
the
process
of
writing.
I
could
tell
him
that
while
the
beginning
of
his
paper
concerning
his
beliefs
may
have
been
helpful
to
him
to
get
started,
that
it
was
the
latter
part
of
the
paper
that
had
his
best
material
pertaining
to
the
assignment.
It
was
a
technique
that
I
hadnOt
thought
of
using
in
this
type
of
situation.
So
I
attempted
to
use
this
when
I
met
with
the
student.
At
first
he
was
reluctant
to
remove
the
beginning
of
his
paper
since
he
wanted
to
make
clear
his
opinion
on
the
subject
of
evolution.
I
explained
to
him
that
he
could
make
his
opinion
clear
in
the
paper
while
still
completing
the
assignment.
I
also
realized
that
in
the
end
the
decision
was
up
to
the
student.
No
amount
of
persuasion
on
my
part
would
get
him
to
change
his
paper
if
his
heart
was
set
on
keeping
the
passage
on
evolution
being
wrong.
I
try
to
keep
this
in
mind
when
conducting
my
conferences.
In
the
end,
it
is
the
writerOs
decision
and
my
position
is
to
give
them
suggestions
to
help
them
to
reach
their
potential.
I
had
a
good
WA
experience
in
the
fall
in
which
I
was
the
student.
A
good
portion
of
my
history
grade
was
to
be
our
term
paper,
yet
there
was
no
WA
assigned
to
the
class.
I
chose
to
write
the
paper
earlier
than
usual
to
give
myself
time
to
go
to
drop-in
hours.
I
looked
at
the
schedule
and
as
it
turned
out,
one
of
my
old
WAs
was
going
to
be
on
duty
one
of
the
days
before
the
paper
was
due.
I
asked
him
to
read
my
paper
and
left
it
for
him.
It
was
good
to
get
a
fresh
set
of
eyes
to
look
at
my
paper.
Additionally,
he
was
familiar
with
my
writing,
so
he
could
focus
on
specific
writing
issues
that
I
have
like
repetition
(which
may
be
present
in
this
essay)
and
including
facts
not
relevant
to
my
main
point.
Attending
a
conference
as
a
student
is
always
a
good
time
for
me,
because
I
donOt
feel
like
I
need
to
come
up
with
all
of
the
answers
or
be
able
to
answer
any
question.
ItOs
then
that
I
realize
that
I
need
to
relax
more
at
times
in
conferences.
Silences
can
be
a
good
thing
and
not
having
all
of
the
answers
is
okay.
I
canOt
make
their
papers
perfect,
especially
since
I
donOt
expect
my
WA
to
do
that
for
me.
One
of
the
best
conferences
I
had
during
the
fall
consisted
of
very
little
writing
on
paper.
A
student
in
the
class
contacted
me
before
the
scheduled
round
of
conferences
and
said
he
needed
help
getting
started
with
writing
the
newest
assignment.
We
set
up
a
time
to
meet,
but
when
we
got
there,
a
problem
arose.
I
had
not
yet
received
the
assignment,
nor
spoken
to
the
professor
to
find
out
what
he
was
looking
for
in
this
paper.
I
briefly
looked
at
the
studentOs
copy
of
the
assignment
and
asked
what
the
problem
was.
He
said
that
while
he
had
some
understanding
of
the
subject,
he
had
no
idea
what
he
could
write
about.
Since
I
had
no
direction
in
this
matter
I
decided
to
work
with
him
on
the
fundamentals
of
his
paper.
The
first
part
of
his
assignment
was
to
talk
about
whether
he
thought
humans
and
chimps
shared
behaviors
that
indicated
that
humans
and
chimps
shared
a
common
ancestor,
a
key
point
in
the
evolution
argument.
Once
he
decided
his
position
on
that
issue
I
had
him
talk
about
why
he
took
that
stance.
He
cited
several
points
and
I
asked
him
if
he
had
any
evidence
from
class
that
could
support
his
statements.
He
said
that
a
movie
in
class
gave
several
examples
of
behaviors
in
chimps
that
appear
very
close
to
human
behaviors.
While
he
was
talking
I
was
taking
notes
of
what
he
said,
in
no
particular
order.
After
he
finished,
I
read
back
to
him
the
different
ideas
he
had
mentioned
and
asked
him
which
ones
he
thought
were
the
strongest.
I
told
him
thatOs
where
he
should
start.
When
he
left,
both
he
and
I
had
a
better
feeling
about
the
paper
and
how
the
rest
of
our
conferences
would
go.
My
second
semester
started
relatively
early.
While
on
campus
for
interim
research,
my
second
semester
professor
e-mailed
me
requesting
a
meeting
to
begin
planning
for
the
semester
since
she
was
going
to
be
teaching
an
overload.
Again
I
had
been
assigned
to
a
professor
in
the
biology
department
(my
second
home).
This
time
however,
I
had
not
had
this
professor
for
a
class
and
had
never
had
any
real
conversation
with
her
either.
I
took
the
opportunity
to
get
a
jump
on
the
semester
and
met
with
the
professor.
At
first
my
impression
of
her
was
that
she
was
very
busy
and
that
it
may
be
difficult
to
meet
with
her
throughout
the
semester
to
discuss
the
details
of
the
different
assignments.
By
the
end
of
the
meeting
though,
I
was
thoroughly
impressed
with
the
level
of
organization
and
professionalism
shown
by
Dr.
Waters.
She
asked
for
my
schedule
for
the
semester
to
see
what
weeks
would
be
tougher
for
me
to
have
conferences.
This
was
the
first
time
that
a
professor
consulted
me
in
the
timing
of
the
conferences.
This
immediately
instilled
in
me
a
sense
of
confidence
in
her
that
she
would
show
me
a
good
deal
of
respect
throughout
the
semester.
This
confidence
was
furthered
when
I
received
the
syllabus
a
week
later.
In
it
were
specific
instructions
about
how
their
papers
were
to
be
in
order
to
go
to
conferences
and
penalties
for
not
showing
up
to
conferences.
This
was
a
welcome
change
in
that
she
was
the
strictest
professor
IOve
had
as
far
as
WA
policies.
This
semester
was
the
first
time
that
I
worked
on
a
single
paper
repeatedly
with
the
students.
This
changed
my
strategies
for
conferences.
Previously
I
could
expect
a
close
to
complete
draft
from
most
students.
For
my
first
round
of
conferences,
I
asked
Dr.
Waters
what
I
should
expect
from
the
students.
I
wanted
to
know
how
far
along
she
expected
them
to
be
with
their
research
papers.
She
told
me
that
everyone
was
at
different
stages
in
the
writing
process
but
that
she
wasnOt
expecting
anyone
to
have
any
certain
length
or
amount
of
material.
Also
she
said
that
she
would
be
asking
the
students
to
include
the
draft
that
I
marked
up
in
their
folder
for
her
so
that
she
could
see
if
they
were
following
my
suggestions
at
all
or
simply
printing
out
a
fresh
draft
for
her.
I
went
to
the
conferences
with
an
unsettling
feeling
because
I
didnOt
know
what
to
expect.
What
I
ended
up
getting
was
every
kind
of
draft
I
could
think
of.
They
ranged
from
Nhelp
me
I
have
no
clue
what
to
write
aboutO
drafts
to
NI
only
have
one
section
to
go
(out
of
a
10-12
page
paper)O
drafts.
This
really
forced
me
to
change
my
strategy
from
conference
to
conference,
which
I
found
was
a
welcome
change.
Each
conference
was
a
little
more
memorable
to
me
because
not
only
were
there
many
topics
for
the
papers,
but
each
one
had
different
information
based
on
how
far
along
the
student
was
in
the
writing
process.
Also
because
of
the
nature
of
the
papers
I
felt
that
my
particular
background
in
biology
was
helpful
both
to
the
students
and
me.
The
papers
were
about
reproductive
technology
and
the
ethics
of
their
use.
My
advantage
was
that
I
could
correct
some
of
the
more
scientific
parts
of
the
papers
to
tell
the
writer
if
it
made
sense
or
whether
they
needed
to
do
more
research.
The
students
felt
more
comfortable
with
me,
I
noticed,
once
I
told
them
I
was
a
biology
major
and
familiar
with
what
they
were
talking
about.
Afterwards
they
would
talk
to
me
more
about
problems
with
finding
evidence
and
putting
it
together
because
I
could
help
them
put
it
in
a
correct
English
and
scientific
manner.
I
felt
this
was
going
to
be
my
most
successful
WA
assignment
yet.
My
biggest
success
of
the
year
occurred
with
a
student
IOd
had
in
the
past.
Our
first
meeting
was
interesting
because
for
him,
it
was
more
comfortable
if
I
pretended
if
I
didnOt
know
much
about
science.
The
student
didnOt
know
what
to
write
about
but
had
done
a
lot
of
research.
He
wanted
to
explain
it
all
to
me
and
then
have
me
help
him
decide
which
topic
he
should
write
about.
I
ended
up
meeting
with
this
student
just
about
every
other
week
to
help
him
with
his
paper.
He
took
it
a
little
slower
than
other
students
in
the
class,
but
in
many
ways
he
was
more
determined
than
they
were.
Writing
had
always
been
a
struggle
for
him,
but
he
was
always
willing
to
put
in
more
effort
to
achieve
a
better
grade.
It
was
one
of
the
reasons
I
looked
forward
to
conferences
with
him.
He
wasnOt
doing
it
because
he
was
required,
but
because
he
really
wanted
my
help.
I
saw
this
student
about
a
month
after
the
semester
ended.
He
had
an
ear-to-ear
grin
and
thanked
me
for
all
the
help
throughout
the
semester.
He
told
me
that
heOd
gotten
an
A
minus
in
the
course
and
he
couldnOt
have
done
it
without
my
help.
There
is
no
better
feeling
in
the
world
than
knowing
you
helped
someone
succeed.
My
last
year
as
a
WA
has
helped
me
to
solidify
my
rather
unique
position
at
Lafayette.
I
am
more
into
the
English
world
than
most
people
in
the
sciences,
yet
I
am
truly
a
scientist
at
heart.
My
past
yearOs
WA
assignments
have
given
me
a
chance
to
expand
upon
my
scientific
knowledge
and
experience
by
editing
many
scientific
based
papers.
On
the
other
hand,
examining
scientific
writing
has
shown
me
how
my
own
writing
can
be
improved
by
having
someone
other
than
myself
read
over
the
paper.
In
spite
of
the
fact
that
I
am
a
WA,
when
I
write
I
am
a
writer,
and
am
too
close
to
the
paper
to
be
completely
objective.
The
more
experience
I
get
as
a
WA,
especially
in
the
biology
department,
the
more
comfortable
I
get
as
a
WA
and
a
scientist.
The
scientific
nature
of
the
papers
takes
away
any
confusion
about
the
material
that
I
may
have
with
other
subjects.
Editing
scientific
papers
helps
me
to
understand
their
nature
and
the
process
of
writing
them,
which
will
help
me
in
the
future.
I
look
forward
to
expanding
on
my
distinctive
position
in
the
writing
and
scientific
community
this
fall.
In
my
last
year
as
a
WA
I
hope
to
learn
as
much
as
I
can
from
my
students
to
prepare
me
to
be
a
better
writer
in
the
future
so
that
I
can
be
a
success
both
in
writing
and
science.
