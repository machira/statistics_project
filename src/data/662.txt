History
As
A
Writer
I
have
always
been
a
reader.
In
elementary
and
middle
school
I
was
that
kid
who
all
the
students
would
go
to
before
silent
reading
hour
to
borrow
a
book.
I
always
had
at
least
10
books
stored
in
my
locker.
I
was
also
the
kid
who
would
be
called
out
and
punished
for
reading
during
class.
Writing,
on
the
other
hand,
was
not
such
an
initial
passion.
I
did
not
write
a
lot
as
a
child,
except
when
it
was
required
at
school.
My
childhood
days
reading,
however,
played
a
great
role
in
allowing
me
to
write
well,
and
allowed
me
to
see
how
important
writing
was
in
every
day
life.
My
passion
to
write
eventually
evolved
from
my
passion
to
read
and
was
molded
and
influenced
by
external
sources
around
me,
such
as
my
parents,
teachers,
friends,
and
even
the
internet.
I
probably
would
not
currently
remember
any
of
my
initial
elementary
school
writing
projects
if
it
hadnOt
been
for
an
8th
grade
writing
assignment,
where
each
student
in
my
class
was
told
to
put
together
an
anthology
of
the
middle
school
essays
that
we
had
written
throughout
the
years.
This
way
we
could
see
how
we
had
progressed.
I,
however,
took
this
a
step
further.
Thanks
to
my
dutiful
parents
and
my
childhood
habit
of
never
throwing
anything
away,
I
had
a
box
filled
with
all
of
my
old
elementary
school
papers
and
projects.
As
I
went
through
the
box,
I
found
everything
from
papers
with
poorly
written
sentences
from
my
kindergarten
class,
to
a
notebook
full
of
poems
that
my
friend
and
I
had
tried
to
turn
into
a
book
in
fourth
grade.
My
earliest
memories
of
writing
were
also
contained
in
these
boxes.
Though
I
had
no
recollection
of
writing
the
kindergarten
sentences,
I
found
many
short
stories
from
my
first
grade
class
about
my
family
and
hobbies.
My
first
grade
teacher
had
told
each
student
that
whenever
we
finished
a
story,
she
would
turn
it
into
a
book.
I
remember
writing
countless
little
stories
and
then
learning
how
to
transfer
them
and
type
them
up
on
our
class
computer.
Once
I
had
typed
everything,
the
teacher
would
print
out
the
pages
and
I
would
draw
pictures
to
go
along
with
the
story.
The
teacher
would
then
take
the
finished
pages,
laminate
them,
and
finally
staple
them
together
so
we
had
a
NrealO
book.
I
can
remember
being
so
proud
of
these
stories
with
the
laminated
covers.
It
felt
like
I
really
had
accomplished
something.
I
now
realize
that
this
Nfinished
bookO
was
a
genius
idea
by
my
teacher,
because
it
gave
me
the
incentive
to
write.
I
could
physically
see
progress
as
my
ideas
went
from
my
mind
into
writing
and
into
something
physical
that
I
could
have
to
keep
forever.
I
also
loved
writing
poetry
when
I
was
younger.
At
one
of
my
DadOs
Christmas
office
parties,
I
was
given
a
nice
notebook
and
pencil
as
an
early
Christmas
present.
I
then
immediately
used
these
to
seamlessly
go
bother
every
child
and
adult
at
the
party.
I
would
ask
anyone
I
could
find
to
give
me
a
subject,
and
I
would
then
proceed
to
write
a
poem
about
whatever
it
was
that
they
had
told
me.
It
was
one
of
the
first
times
I
had
used
writing
to
entertain
myself,
and
it
allowed
me
to
be
openly
creative.
I
was
so
proud
of
these
little
poems,
that
I
later
entered
some
of
then
to
an
online
poetry
contest.
Supposedly
I
won
a
very
minimal
spot
where
the
poems
would
be
published
in
a
book,
however,
the
book
was
very
expensive
so
I
never
saw
the
outcome,
but
I
was
so
young
that
it
was
exciting
just
the
same.
As
I
got
older,
my
parents
began
to
influence
my
writing.
For
example,
every
Saturday
my
family
would
have
this
wonderful
tradition
where
the
kids
(me,
my
brother,
and
my
sister)
would
be
given
lists
of
chores
that
we
had
to
complete
by
the
end
of
the
day.
We
hated
this
wonderful
tradition,
but,
due
to
our
massive
amounts
of
complaining,
every
once
in
a
while,
my
dad
would
give
us
an
out.
We
were
told
that
if
we
read
a
pre-approved
article,
or
anything
from
a
National
Geographic
magazine,
we
could
write
a
few
pages
commenting
on
the
article
and
use
the
finished
report
to
replace
a
chore
on
the
list.
These
mini-reports,
as
simple
and
meaningless
as
they
may
seem,
greatly
expanded
my
love
for
writing.
I
realized,
quite
quickly,
that
because
the
reports
were
not
for
school
and
would
not
be
graded,
I
could
have
fun
with
them.
I
learned
to
incorporate
facts,
while
keeping
the
reports
fun
and
light,
with
plenty
of
sarcastic
comments
or
jokes
for
my
Dad
to
read.
I
feel
that
this
was
a
key
turning
point
in
the
history
of
my
writing.
It
taught
me
that
writing
does
not
always
have
to
be
structured
as
it
was
in
a
school
environment.
In
school
I
was
always
careful
to
not
make
jokes
or
add
my
own
opinions
because
the
paper
was
going
to
be
graded
by
a
serious
English
teacher.
It
was
no
time
to
take
risks.
Writing
for
fun,
for
my
Dad,
allowed
me
to
be
truly
creative
and
put
my
own
voice
into
a
paper
for
the
first
time.
I
loved
it.
I
could
take
risks
and
see
what
worked
without
putting
my
grades
on
the
line.
My
junior
year
of
High
School
challenged
me
with
a
very
new
type
of
writing
assignment.
My
school
had
what
is
called
a
NJunior
Research
PaperO,
where
each
junior
had
to
read
a
book,
choose
a
thesis,
and
write
at
least
a
13
page
paper
about
it.
Needless
to
say,
none
of
us
had
ever
written
this
much
and
we
were
all
scared
out
of
our
minds.
Luckily,
my
junior
year
English
teacher
was
amazing.
He
walked
the
entire
class
through
the
paper
step-by-step
so
that
each
student
knew
what
he
or
she
was
doing
at
all
times.
It
was
broken
down
so
well
that
the
whole
process
became
easy.
We
wrote
down
our
thesis
and
then
came
up
with
multiple
supporting
facts.
Then,
we
went
through
our
books
to
find
quotes
that
would
match
each
supporting
fact,
and
wrote
each
quote
on
an
index
card
labeled
with
the
supporting
fact
it
corresponded
to.
Once
we
had
all
the
quotes
organized,
writing
the
paper
was
easy.
We
just
had
to
input
the
facts,
quotations,
and
our
explanations
of
the
quotations
in
the
right
places.
This
method
has
helped
me
with
papers
in
college
as
well.
I
learned
that
once
a
paper
is
pre-organized,
it
is
just
a
matter
of
putting
the
pieces
together
and
filling
in
the
blanks.
Senior
year
of
high
school
also
proved
to
be
a
huge
stepping-stone
in
my
writing
career.
I
took
AP
English,
which
was
by
far
my
most
vigorous
class
to
date.
For
the
first
half
of
the
year,
we
were
required
to
write
at
least
a
7
page
essay
a
week.
Eventually
the
class
got
up
to
a
point
where
my
teacher
had
each
student
writing
one
in
class
and
one
out
of
class
paper
each
week,
along
with
answering
style
packets
and
reading
every
night.
This
was
the
most
intense
writing
I
had
ever
done
in
my
life,
but
my
teacher
was
so
supportive,
that
I
would
one
hundred
percent
chose
to
take
it
again.
My
teacher
would
have
every
paper
graded
(with
comments)
and
back
to
us
the
day
after
we
handed
it
in,
which
is
a
big
deal
when
every
week
he
was
getting
20
very
long
papers
to
grade.
Not
only
that,
but
if
we
had
our
essays
finished
early
he
would
read
them
and
tell
us
what
to
fix.
This
kept
me
very
much
on
a
tight
schedule
and
I
learned
to
not
procrastinate.
I
would
write
my
papers
Sunday
morning
and
have
my
teacher
edit
them
Monday
afternoon.
Then
I
would
fix
them
up
and
hand
them
in
for
official
grading
on
Wednesday.
That
AP
English
class
taught
me
to
not
be
afraid
of
papers.
When
IOm
in
a
College
English
class
and
am
told
that
I
will
have
to
write
three
papers
over
the
course
of
a
semester,
it
doesnOt
phase
me
at
all,
because
IOll
have
a
whole
semester
to
do
then,
where
as
if
I
were
in
my
AP
English
class,
I
would
only
have
three
weeks.
The
class
also
taught
me
to
just
sit
down
and
write.
If
I
had
a
paper
outlined,
I
could
usually
write
a
7
to
10
page
draft
in
one
to
three
hours,
and
have
it
not
need
that
much
editing.
I,
however,
learned
that
this
only
worked
if
I
went
straight
through
the
papers
with
no
interruptions.
The
weekly
writing
cause
me
to
eventually
have
paper
writing
down
to
a
formula.
I
had
been
trained
since
7th
grade
to
be
a
5-paragraph
essay
kid,
and
I
swore
by
the
method.
I
had
outline
sheets
for
each
paragraph-
topic
sentence,
supporting
sentences,
closing
sentence,
and
I
wrote
by
rules.
Find
a
topic,
find
three
supporting
facts
for
the
topic,
and
three
quotes
for
each
fact.
Next,
turn
each
fact
into
a
different
paragraph,
using
three
quotations
per
paragraph
with
sentences
explaining
each
quotation.
This
NformulaO
caused
College
writing
to
be
quite
difficult.
College
writing
does
not
necessarily
fall
into
the
N5
paragraphO
technique.
My
freshman
year
seminar
was
my
first
big
realization
of
this.
My
teacher
did
not
want
each
body
paragraph
to
be
a
page
and
a
half
long,
if
not
more.
He
wanted
Nas
many
paragraphs
as
were
necessaryO,
and
no,
that
didnOt
mean
five.
That
meant,
I
soon
learned,
a
lot
of
little
paragraphs
that
were
much
more
readable.
This
was
a
slap
in
the
face
and
probably
the
most
difficult
challenge
IOve
faced
with
writing
thus
far.
I
needed
to
learn
to
break
out
of
everything
I
had
previously
been
taught,
I
needed
to
leave
my
comfort
zone.
Lucky
for
me,
I
have
never
been
a
procrastinator
when
it
comes
to
writing.
Based
on
my
time
line,
I
will
generally
spend
half
my
time
thinking
about
the
topic.
This
helps
to
mentally
prepare
myself
to
write
the
paper.
Then,
I
take
one
day
to
outline
the
paper,
I
write
down
my
topic,
find
supporting
facts,
and
locate
any
useful
quotes
(if
quotes
are
necessary).
Then,
one
day
is
designated
for
writing
the
paper
in
one
sitting.
My
remaining
time
is
then
used
for
editing
the
paper
until
it
is
something
I
would
want
to
turn
in.
I
would
usually
then
turn
the
paper
in
early
to
have
a
WA
or
my
teacher
read
it,
where
I
would,
more
likely
then
not,
find
out
that
it
was
not
actually
anywhere
near
ready
to
hand
in.
This
editing
revising
process
would
go
on
until
time
ran
out
and
I
had
to
officially
turn
the
paper
in.
The
first
time
I
had
to
write
a
non-five-paragraph
paper,
I
had
a
very
supportive
WA,
who
had
no
problems
with
me
emailing
him
my
paper
at
all
times
of
day.
Through
my
WA
and
my
teacherOs
comments,
I
learned
to
write
in
short
paragraphs,
so
that
my
papers
became
much
more
readable
and
clear.
I
never
actually
realized
how
much
I
had
evolved
as
a
writer
until
last
year,
when
I
was
required
to
write
an
essay
to
try
and
win
an
arts
Scholarship.
I
used
my
pre-organizing
and
draft
writing
skills
to
come
up
with
an
initial
draft.
I
showed
it
to
my
dad,
who
gave
me
some
very
useful
writing
advice-
Ntie
it
togetherO.
My
essay
made
great
points,
but
it
was
all
over
the
place.
So
what
I
did,
was
come
up
with
something
to
tie
everything
together.
With
the
help
of
my
dad,
I
found
and
used
the
word
NsynergyO
to
connect
all
my
examples,
as
each
example
represented
how
I
wanted
to
combine
arts
and
sciences
to
create
something
entirely
new.
I
edited
the
paper
over
and
over
again
and
ended
up
winning
the
scholarship.
Just
recently,
I
went
back
and
re-read
the
paper,
and
in
doing
so,
I
realized
that
everything
I
used
in
writing
such
a
successful
paper
had
come
from
all
the
little
changes
in
my
writing
history
that
I
had
explained
above,
and
I
was
really
able
to
see
how
far
IOd
come
as
a
writer.
I
have
greatly
progressed
as
a
writer
throughout
the
years.
I
have
learned
to
love
writing
creatively,
and
I
am
no
longer
limited
to
5
paragraph
essays.
I
hope
to
branch
out
and
continue
to
express
myself
through
creative
writing
on
my
own,
but
I
also
hope
to
grow
as
a
formal
writer
through
the
help
of
college
classes
and
professors.
I
am
very
grateful
to
the
parents
and
teachers
who
have
advanced
my
writing
abilities
to
where
they
are
today,
because
I
feel
that
writing
effectively
is
a
great
tool
that
can
be
used
in
most
any
job
or
life
experience.
Writing
also
is
a
great
tool
to
learn
how
to
communicate
and
grow
as
a
person
because
writing
allows
for
expansion
and
creativity,
where
a
person
is
able
to
create
something
out
of
nothing.
The
great
thing
is,
writing
never
gets
old.
There
is
no
winner,
or
level
where
someone
is
automatically
Nthe
bestO.
Writing
is
something
that
can
always
be
worked
on
and
improved,
no
matter
how
good
a
person
is,
and
I
hope
to
further
improve
my
writing
throughout
the
rest
of
my
college
career.
