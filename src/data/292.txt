Literary
Narrative
WA
Workshop:
Fall
2001
I
have
always
thought
of
writing
as
being
an
intricate
and
necessary
part
of
my
life.
It
is
the
staple
of
everything
we
do:
how
we
communicate,
articulate,
and
express
ourselves.
However,
as
I
read
over
the
assignment
to
chronicle
my
history
as
a
writer,
I
am
perplexed
by
the
feet
that
I
have
very
few,
if
any,
memories
of
writing
at
an
early
age.
I
can
recall
the
very
early
acts
of
writing.
For
example,
I
can
clearly
remember
learning
how
to
write
in
cursive.
The
early
rhetoric
of
learning
how
to
spell
words
like,
"run,
ran,
rat,
bat,
bag..remains
a
vivid
memory
in
my
mind.
I
can
also
recall
that
I
never
liked
Fridays
at
a
young
age
because
it
meant
that
I
would
have
to
endure
another
painful
spelling
test,
which
I
found
could
always
put
a
large
gray
cloud
over
any
day.
The
next
set
of
memories
of
writing
comes
during
those
difficult
middle
school
years.
However,
the
memories
of
these
writings
didn't
occur
in
school,
but
rather
out
of
school.
I
believe
it
was
my
sixth
grade
teacher
who
was
one
of
the
first
people
who
consciously
introduced
me
to
poetry.
It
was
a
new
form
of
writing
that
I
wasn't
whether
I
liked
it
or
not.
They
didn't
use
complete
sentences,
spoke
in
rhyme,
and
sometimes
seemed
to
be
talking
about
something
completely
different
than
what
they
were
writing.
I
became
fascinated
with
this
form
of
writing.
However,
this
was
done
without
anyone
else
knowing
because
a
middle
school
child
rarely
ever
gets
excited
or
interested
in
anything
academic.
I
began
writing
my
own
poetry
in
my
spare
time,
keeping
journals
of
my
thoughts.
They
now
serve
as
a,
sometimes
painful,
but
always
honest,
chronicle
of
those
difficult
early
teen
years.
This
was
really
the
first
time
that
I
began
to
creatively
explore
the
possibilities
of
writing
as
an
outlet
for
my
own
thoughts.
I
found
that
writing
my
own
poetry,
as
well
as
reading
the
work
of
others
was
a
wonderful
way
to
understand
and
interpret
my
experiences.
This
period
in
my
life
has
strongly
influenced
in
my
writing.
I
feel
that
most
of
the
creative
aspects
of
my
writing,
the
vivid
descriptions
I
find
so
inviting
in
prose,
stem
from
this
time
in
my
life.
High
school
is
really
the
first
time
that
I
can
really
begin
to
remember
particular
pieces
of
writing
that
have
influenced
me.
My
sophomore
year
of
high
school
is
one
of
the
most
memorable
years
of
writing
in
my
life.
It
was
at
this
time
when
I
met
Karen
Bucholc,
quite
possibly
the
most
vibrant,
caring,
intelligent
women
I
have
ever
met
in
my
life.
Walking
into
her
classroom
was
like
walking
straight
into
a
theater.
You
could
feel
Shakespeare
alive
in
the
room
as
she
acted
out
the
verses
of
Romeo
and
Juliet
with
such
passion
in
her
voice
that
I
could
never
understand
how
anyone
could
not
absolutely
love
his
work.
On
the
first
morning
of
her
class
she
sat
us
down
and
gave
us
a
speech
that
I
will
never
forget.
She
would
make
us
work
more
and
harder
than
we
ever
though
humanly
possible
and
we
would
e
expected
to
grant
her
the
respect
that
she
deserved.
She
would,
in
turn,
do
the
same
for
us.
She
would
also
as
open
doors
of
language
and
literature
every
day
and
ensure
that
we
would
grow
and
expand
as
both
writers,
as
well
as
human
beings.
She
stretched
us
as
writers
with
every
assignment.
From
papers
of
persuasion
after
reading
works
by
Thomas
Paine,
to
the
most
atypical
comparison
papers
after
reading
1984,
to
a
piece
in
which
we
had
to
evoke
all
five
senses
from
a
picture
of
a
place
in
which
we
had
never
been,
my
writing
improved
every
day.
However,
my
most
memorable
moment
of
writing
for
her
took
place
at
the
end
of
the
year.
This
is
where
I
took
part
in
my
first
all-nighter,
something
I
would
become
painfully
aquatinted
with
in
my
later
years.
This
was
the
dreaded
poetry
project.
Interestingly,
everyone
in
the
high
school
knew
about
it,
even
though
very
few
had
taken
her
class.
This
project
was
the
reason
students
hated
school
and
the
reason
teachers
loved
it.
Every
year
they
were
the
most
elaborate,
academic
pieces
of
art
the
school
created
and
others
in
the
community
actually
came
to
see
the
projects.
The
assignment
was
this:
a
complete
compilation
of
poetry,
both
your
and
others.
It
was
to
be
created
to
convey
a
theme,
a
part
of
you,
but
also
a
part
of
others
throughout
the
world.
The
goal
for
this
assignment
was
to
combine
the
personal
with
the
worldly
and
create
a
piece
of
art
pleasing
in
every
way,
while
emphasizing
presentation,
content,
and
the
message
behind
it
all.
My
theme
was
Irish
love.
I
have
always
found
writings,
both
prose
and
poetry,
about
love
to
be
particularly
intriguing
and
interesting.
I
have
found
that
those
writing
about
love
are
usually
either
in
out
recently
out
of
love
and
those
are
two
of
the
most
passionate
times
one
can
experience.
Everything
is
cause
for
fireworks,
whether
positive
or
negative,
even
when
something
as
simple
as
the
sun
rises.
That
makes
for
beautiful
writing.
And
since
all
my
ancestors
are
Irish
I
have
found
that
to
explore
where
I
come
from
is
often,
though
cliche,
helpful
in
finding
myself.
My
presentation
mirrored
a
trek
through
the
Irish
woods,
on
search
for
gold.
The
reader,
or
"experiencer"
as
Karen
preferred
to
call
herself,
was
greeted
by
a
narrated
tape
by
an
Irish
relative,
a
thick
brogue
leading
the
reader
to
the
pot
of
gold
where
a
large
black
pot
was
filled
to
the
brim
with
different
sized
gold
round
gold
boxes.
Inside
were
the
various
elements
of
writing,
both
mine
as
well
as
others.
Apart
they
were
merely
small
pieces
of
writing,
but
together
they
painted
a
vastly
real
portrait
of
life
and
love.
It
was
here
where
I
became
interested
in
reading
outside
the
classroom
for
my
own
pleasure.
I
was
introduced
to
Dylan
Thomas
while
doing
this
project
and
became
interested
in
his
work
immediately.
I
was
drawn
to
him
because
of
his
Irish
roots
as
well
as
his
overall
writing
style.
As
high
school
went
on,
my
teachers
focused
on
making
us
experience
many
different
genres
of
writing.
Research
papers,
persuasion,
and
comparisons
are
only
a
few
types
of
writing
to
which
I
was
exposed.
Most
of
my
high
school
teachers
felt
strongly
that
a
large
vocabulary
was
important
to
have.
Therefore,
as
far
back
as
I
can
remember,
my
teachers
have
always
stressed
exposing
one's
self
to
new
words
every
day.
I
was
always
taught
to
read
with
a
dictionary
so
that
when
I
encountered
a
word
with
which
I
was
not
familiar,
I
could
look
it
up.
The
next
period
of
time
when
writing
seemed
to
take
up
a
huge
part
of
my
life
was
while
I
was
applying
to
colleges.
I
was
convinced
that
my
college
essays
had
to
be
amazing.
Unfortunately,
I
had
to
write
about
ten
because
every
school
to
which
I
applied
had
such
different
expectations
of
the
admissions
essay.
It
was
a
very
interesting
experience
for
me
because
I
was
merely
trying
to
get
these
assignments
done,
merely
get
them
out
of
the
way
so
I
could
get
on
with
my
senior
year.
However,
in
the
process,
I
ended
up
putting
so
much
more
of
myself
into
the
writings
and
learning
a
tremendous
amount
about
who
I
am
as
a
person.
I
was
working
on
my
essays
with
the
same
teacher
I
had
during
my
sophomore
year.
Therefore,
I
was
writing
with
intense
emotions
and
feelings
because
she
was
so
intent
on
making
us
grow
as
writers.
When
someone
asks
a
17-year-old
what
the
defining
moment
in
their
life
has
been
thus
far,
most
don't
know
what
to
make
of
it.
I
felt
I
didn't
have
any
defining
moments.
How
could
I?
I
was
only
a
kid.
While
working
with
my
teacher,
I
learned
to
put
my
own
experiences
and
thoughts
into
my
writing.
That
was
something
that
I'm
not
sure
I
had
ever
done
before
that
point.
I
had
done
research
papers
from
the
time
I
was
very
young,
I
had
found
symbolism
in
novels
and
related
it
to
the
world,
but
I
had
never
really
found
a
way
to
make
my
experiences
passionate
and
honest
enough
for
others
to
read.
I
discovered
a
lot
about
myself
as
a
writer
and
as
a
person
while
writing
those
essays
and
I
try
to
carry
some
of
that
passion
I
had
at
that
time
with
me
whenever
I
write.
As
high
school
came
to
a
close,
I
felt
very
prepared
for
college
writing.
I
knew
I
would
have
challenges
placed
before
me,
but
I
also
knew
that
I
had
learned
from
one
of
the
most
intelligent
and
passionate
people
I
had
ever
met.
I
had,
with
the
help
of
my
teachers,
brought
my
reading
and
writing
to
a
new
level.
However,
one
thing
that
I
neglected
to
take
into
account
was
that,
although
I
had
strong
technical
skills,
I
had
only
written
for
two
English
teachers
throughout
my
entire
high
school
career.
My
immediate
fear
became
that
I
had
not
learned
to
be
a
good
writer,
but
that
I
may
have,
over
time,
merely
leaned
how
to
please
these
particular
two
individuals.
I
suppose
it
was
just
one
of
the
many
fears
we
all
experience
before
entering
college.
Once
I
reached
college,
I
did
find
many
differences
regarding
writing.
The
professors
expected
us
to
produce
more
writing
with
much
less
time;
this
I
had
expected.
My
high
school
classes
had
been
fairly
demanding;
therefore,
I
was
prepared
for
that.
I
did,
however,
have
to
learn
how
to
write
my
own
work,
rather
that
writing
to
a
particular
person.
I
had
come
to
understand
my
high
school
teachers
so
well
that
I
wrote
in
a
system
that
I
knew
it
was
safe.
For
me,
college
writing
has
been
about
leaving
that
safeguard
to
try
to
strengthen
my
writing.
One
change
that
I
found
difficult
was
the
concept
of
rough
drafts.
Although
I
suppose
most
people
are
more
likely
to
use
peer
editing
and
rough
drafts
in
high
school
and
not
in
college,
I
was
the
opposite.
We
had
used
them
occasionally
in
high
school,
but
it
was
usually
voluntary.
Because
of
the
way
I
write,
any
rough
draft
I
passed
in
usually
held
only
a
remote
resemblance
to
my
final
work.
When
I
write,
I
may
have
an
idea
for
weeks,
I
may
sit
down
to
write
and
brainstorm,
I
may
even
get
some
words
down
on
paper.
But
I
don't
truly
start
to
write
anything
until
I
sit
at
the
computer
and
the
words
just
begin
to
flow.
They
may
seem
like
gibberish,
but
if
I'm
typing
freely
I
can
usually
form
them
into
a
coherent
body
of
thoughts
after
I
finish
typing.
That
was
one
of
the
reasons
I
have
always
had
a
hard
time
with
rough
drafts.
Many
times
the
teacher
would
just
ask
for
a
hand
written
outline
or
just
a
few
thoughts
written
down
on
paper.
As
a
writer,
I
always
go
straight
to
the
computer
to
put
my
thoughts
down;
I
never
use
a
paper
and
pencil.
Its
one
of
those
unbreakable
habits
now
but
I
think
it
began
because
of
two
very
silly
reasons;
I
have
poor
handwriting
and
I'm
left
handed
so
when
I
write
with
pencil,
my
hand
always
smudges
the
paper.
As
my
time
in
college
increased,
I
began
to
adjust
to
some
of
these
changes.
Though
I
have
still
not
been
able
to
write
without
a
computer,
I
have
realized
the
importance
of
the
peer
editor,
as
well
as
rough
drafts.
I
needed
to
mature
as
a
writer
before
I
could
organize
my
thoughts
and
time
enough
to
realize
that
by
preparing
my
thoughts
ahead
of
time,
I
can
improve
my
writing
in
both
mechanics
as
well
as
content.
Although
I
have
been
exposed
to
many
different
genres
of
writing
in
my
past,
I
have
remained
a
very
traditional
writer.
When
writing
a
paper,
I
usually
strive
for
nicely
formed
paragraphs,
smooth
transition
sentences,
and
a
clear
thesis
that
is
stated,
explored,
proved,
and
concluded.
It
was
last
year,
in
my
college
writing
course
that
I
took,
what
was
probably,
the
biggest
risk
with
my
writing.
We
had
been
assigned
our
final
paper;
to
find
a
'good'
piece
of
art
and
write
about
it.
Our
piece
of
art
could
be
in
any
medium
and
we
could
write
in
any
way
we
chose.
The
day
before
the
paper
was
assigned
my
professor
discussed
a
form
of
writing
called
spiral
writing.
It
was
very
contemporary
as
far
as
I
was
concerned.
It
was
done
by
taking
a
piece
of
writing
and
then
jumping
back
and
forth
between
the
two
lines
of
thought
throughout
the
entire
paper.
Coming
closer
and
closer
together
through
the
paper,
the
reader
still
my
not
understand.
My
professor
said
we
could
try
this
if
we
wanted
a
challenge.
It
took
a
lot
of
faith
on
the
parts
of
both
the
reader,
as
well
as
the
writer.
I
chose
a
song
by
Ani
Difranco
as
my
art.
Instead
of
critiquing
the
song
and
explaining
how
it
related
to
my
life,
I
chose
to
quote
small
portions
of
the
song
and
then
gave
a
personal
narrative
from
my
life.
There
were
no
bridges,
no
explanations,
only
stories
that
seemed
to
paint
a
picture.
We
were
assigned
to
write
how
this
piece
of
art
made
us
feel,
why
we
felt
it
was
great.
Instead,
I
explained
how
it
made
me
feel
by
sharing
all
the
emotions
and
stories
it
evoked
in
my
mind
while
I
heard
the
song.
I
showed
how,
even
though
it
was
completely
different
from
my
thoughts,
the
song
touched
me
numerous
times
on
a
personal
level
with
out
ever
actually
saying
any
of
it.
I
was
extremely
proud
of
that
piece
of
writing
and
still
am.
I
took
a
chance,
went
out
on
a
limb.
The
result
was
my
growth
as
a
writer.
As
writers,
all
we
can
do
is
step
away
from
the
safe
ground
and
hope
we
rise
to
the
occasion
and
grow
as
individuals
through
our
writing.
