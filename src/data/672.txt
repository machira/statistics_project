Literacy
Narrative
I
looked
over
at
the
clock
on
my
wall
and
saw
with
dismay
that
it
was
6:13
pm.
In
less
than
twenty
four
hours
my
final
paper
for
a
300
level
biology
class
was
due,
and
I
had
next
to
nothing
written
down.
Normally
I
wouldnyut
have
been
worried,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
I
also
had
a
final
exam
the
next
day
that
I
hadnyut
begun
to
study
for.
The
problem
was
that
I
had
to
come
up
with
twelve
pages
of
writing
on
a
seven
page
article
about
hybrid
scallop
systems.
Not
only
did
I
have
no
particular
strategy
in
mind
to
turn
seven
pages
of
writing
into
twelve,
but
I
could
barely
comprehend
what
I
was
reading.
The
topic
was
considerably
complex,
even
for
the
course
I
was
taking,
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
original
article
had
been
written
in
another
language
and
then
poorly
translated
into
English.
It
was
quickly
beginning
to
look
like
thirty
percent
of
my
grade
was
going
to
be
a
complete
train
wreck,
and
I
started
to
panic.
Thatyus
when
I
remembered
Yang.
I
tried
not
to
appear
utterly
horrified
as
I
was
reading
his
introduction
paragraph,
but
from
the
look
on
Yangyus
face
I
realized
that
my
efforts
werenyut
proving
very
successful.
This
was
the
second
conference
Iyud
had
with
Yang;
during
the
first
one,
weeks
earlier,
we
had
mainly
brainstormed
because
he
had
virtually
nothing
written
down
for
what
was
supposed
to
be
a
ten
to
twelve
page
research
paper.
Therefore,
upon
our
second
meeting,
I
was
very
pleased
to
see
that
he
had
a
complete
ten
page
draft
to
show
me.
As
he
handed
me
the
draft,
I
silently
prayed
that
his
paper
would
surprise
me
and
be
utterly
amazing
for
two
reasons.
The
first
reason
was
that
Yangyus
was
the
last
conference
of
the
day
(and
therefore
I
was
exhausted),
and
the
second
reason
was
that
because
the
paper
was
due
tomorrow,
he
would
have
barely
any
time
at
all
to
fix
it
if
there
were
major
problems.
My
heart
sank
when
after
reading
only
the
first
sentence
I
realized
that
English
was
definitely
not
Yangyus
first
language.
By
this
point
I
had
only
been
a
WA
for
a
couple
of
months,
and
I
barely
had
two
rounds
of
conferences
under
my
belt.
I
had
not,
during
that
time,
come
across
writing
that
was
completely
unreadablenountil
my
conference
with
Yang.
I
was
beginning
to
panic,
realizing
I
had
no
idea
how
to
handle
this
situation.
When
I
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
of
his
painful
introductory
paragraph,
I
began
wracking
my
mind
for
some
way
to
salvage
his
paper,
but
with
his
lack
of
comprehension
of
the
English
language
and
the
prospect
of
him
having
to
turn
the
paper
in
the
following
day,
I
feared
there
was
nothing
I
could
do
in
30
minutes
to
help
him
turn
out
work
that
would
receive
a
passing
grade.
Since
I
was
at
a
loss
for
words,
I
decided
to
start
reading
his
first
body
paragraph.
And
then
something
exponentially
worse
happened.
The
writing
was
perfect.
It
followed
every
standard
and
convention
of
the
English
language
that
I
was
aware
of,
and
it
flowed
seamlessly.
It
was
written
far
better
than
any
literature
I
am
capable
of
producing,
and
to
make
it
even
more
professional
it
was
included
the
occasional
table
or
graph.
It
was
so
perfect
that
it
seemed
almost
peer-reviewed.
Actually,
it
was
peer-reviewed.
It
was
plagiarized.
And
it
had
almost
nothing
to
do
with
the
topic
that
was
assigned
for
the
paper.
At
this
point,
I
had
one
half
a
page
of
unreadable
writing
and
nine
and
a
half
pages
of
plagiarized,
irrelevant
information.
I
looked
up
at
Yang
and
saw
him
smiling
shyly
back
at
me.
Breaking
his
heart
by
telling
him
he
was
in
serious
trouble
was
going
to
shatter
mine,
but
I
was
five
hours
into
conferencing
and
digging
pretty
deep
to
find
just
one
more
ounce
of
inspiration.
I
took
a
deep
breath
and
told
Yang,
meOkay,
we
have
a
lot
to
talk
about.mo
This
was
the
first
time
I
really
had
to
think
like
a
veteran
WA.
I
prioritized
Yangyus
issues
in
my
mind
as
I
tried
to
come
up
with
the
best
strategy
for
damage
control.
Iyum
almost
positive
that
no
one
has
ever
gotten
thrown
out
of
Lafayette
College
for
being
a
poor
writer,
but
Iyum
pretty
certain
that
if
I
looked
hard
enough
I
could
find
at
least
a
few
students
that
were
thrown
out
for
plagiarism.
I
decided
that
this
was
the
first
thing
that
I
had
to
address,
so
I
explained
the
concept
to
Yang,
and
how
important
it
was
that
he
avoid
it.
I
showed
him
how
to
use
in-text
citations,
and
I
tried
to
explain
to
him
how
to
paraphrase.
I
realized
that
with
his
limited
comprehension
of
the
English
language,
paraphrasing
would
probably
be
very
difficult,
but
I
thought
I
should
introduce
him
to
it
anyway.
I
also
explained
that
he
needed
to
do
some
of
his
own
analysis
because
his
professor
would
be
more
interested
in
Yangyus
understanding
and
original
presentation
of
the
material
than
he
would
be
in
the
facts
and
ideas
offered
by
someone
else.
After
I
was
satisfied
that
Yang
had
some
idea
what
I
was
talking
about,
I
thought
about
what
I
should
address
next.
I
knew
his
teacher
would
inevitably
fail
him
if
he
wrote
about
the
wrong
topic,
so,
even
if
it
was
poorly
written,
I
knew
I
had
to
get
him
to
discuss
a
relevant
issue
in
his
paper.
We
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
writing
out
an
outline
that
included
the
most
essential
points
he
needed
to
include
according
to
the
prompt.
While
making
that
outline,
we
tried
to
pull
out
pieces
from
his
ten
pages
that
he
could
use
in
his
next
draft.
During
that
endeavor,
Yang
and
I
both
realized
that
he
didnyut
understand
some
of
what
he
had
included
in
his
paper.
I
told
him,
meIf
you
canyut
understand
it,
you
probably
will
have
a
hard
time
explaining
it,
and
you
shouldnyut
include
it,mo
and
he
smirked
at
me
while
he
crossed
out
a
bunch
of
other
passages
that
he
had
originally
wanted
to
add
to
his
new
draft.
By
the
time
I
got
to
address
the
quality
of
his
writing,
I
peered
up
at
the
clock
in
the
Watt
Writing
Room
and
saw
that
51
minutes
had
passed.
Yang
had
done
well;
he
was
very
receptive
and
never
became
discouraged,
and
he
looked
ready
and
willing
to
sacrifice
sleep
to
make
the
necessary
changes.
However,
I
was
exhausted,
he
looked
like
he
was
itching
to
get
started,
and
there
was
just
no
way
I
could
teach
him
everything
he
needed
to
know
about
the
English
language
in
one
night.
I
reluctantly
let
him
go
and
wished
him
luck
with
his
paper.
I
hoped
I
gave
him
enough
tools
to
turn
out
work
that
would
pass,
but
I
was
doubtful
that
he
would
get
the
grade
that
he
really
wanted.
When
I
finally
snapped
back
to
reality,
I
realized
that
it
was
now
6:19.
I
had
wasted
6
minutes
reminiscing
about
a
totally
unrelated
subject.
But
then
again,
maybe
I
hadnyut.
Instead
of
trying
to
complete
a
masterpiece,
like
I
would
usually
attempt
to
do,
I
decided
to
follow
my
own
advice
to
Yang.
Damage
control.
To
write
twelve
pages
from
seven,
I
could
paraphrase
and
stretch
one
sentence
into
two.
Then
I
could
include
my
own
analysis
to
add
substance.
If
I
didnyut
understand
something,
I
didnyut
let
it
concern
me.
I
had
a
good
handle
on
the
class,
and
if
something
seemed
too
complex,
it
was
probably
irrelevant,
unnecessary
to
touch
upon,
and
of
little
interest
to
my
professor.
I
forced
myself
to
stay
on
topic.
And
lastly,
when
the
language
became
confusing,
either
because
it
was
difficult
material
or
because
it
was
poorly
written,
I
didnyut
get
discouraged.
I
thought
about
Yang
trying
to
decipher
a
language
that
was
relatively
new
to
him,
and
reproached
myself
for
complaining
about
a
language
I
have
known
all
my
life.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
didnyut
go
completely
overboard
on
an
assignment.
I
didnyut
try
to
do
too
much.
I
didnyut
try
to
break
the
rules,
to
go
above
and
beyond
the
requirements
of
the
assignment.
I
didnyut
challenge
the
teacher
or
the
established
order.
I
didnyut
try
to
stick
out
of
the
crowd,
to
place
my
work
at
the
head
of
the
class.
I
didnyut
exceed
the
writing
requirement
(which,
I
might
add,
has
always
been
a
requirement
of
mine).
I
didnyut
try
to
perform
a
miracle
in
a
single
night.
I
completed
an
assignment.
I
did
exactly
what
the
prompt
required.
And
I
got
an
A
on
the
paper.
I
guess
sometimes
damage
control
really
works
to
oneyus
favor.
It
might
be
surprising,
but
that
was
not
the
first
time
that
working
with
a
student
actually
altered
my
mentality
as
a
writer.
And
it
certainly
wasnyut
the
first
time
that
my
writing
benefitted
from
my
experiences
in
conferencing
with
a
student.
I
can
say
that
I
had
a
lot
of
expectations
for
this
job,
and
many
of
them
were
accurate;
I
can
also
say
that
I
received
great
training
from
the
College
Writing
Program,
and
that
I
felt
ready
to
do
my
job
by
the
completion
of
it.
But
the
truth
is
that
there
really
isnyut
anything
that
the
College
Writing
Program
can
teach
new
writing
associates
that
will
fully
prepare
them
for
the
experiences
that
they
will
have
during
their
first
semester
on
the
job.
Donyut
get
me
wrong;
Professors
Tatu
and
Falbo
do
a
great
job
conveying
the
ideologies
and
the
goals
of
the
program
to
new
WAyus,
and
veteran
WAyus
share
plenty
of
methods
that
can
be
very
successful
when
working
with
student
writers.
But
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
every
WA
will
realize
their
own
unique
working
style,
every
student
writer
will
present
different
strengths
and
weaknesses,
and
every
new
conference
will
bring
unprecedented
challenges
and
successes.
Incredibly,
any
given
meeting
with
a
student
writer
will
inevitably
provide
opportunities
to
reveal
new
strategies
to
connect
to
students,
to
find
new
ways
to
approach
the
writing
process,
and
sometimes,
unfortunately,
to
discover
road
blocks
in
the
way
of
accomplishing
either
of
these
things.
It
will
also
offer
the
opportunity
for
the
writing
associate
to
enhance
their
own
work,
and
that
is
an
invaluable
benefit
that
I
never
saw
coming.
One
thing
I
had
never
considered
by
the
time
I
started
working
was
the
possibility
that
I
would
undergo
just
as
many
changes
and
just
as
much
growth
as
the
student
writers
I
would
work
with.
Not
only
did
this
not
occur
to
me,
but
I
cannot
even
remember
discussing
this
phenomenon
during
my
training
by
the
College
Writing
Program.
That
could
be
because
I
was
so
naFu
e
that
I
was
too
focused
on
trying
to
learn
the
mesecretsmo
of
having
successful
conferences;
it
might
also
be
because
I
simply
wasnyut
receptive
enough
to
realize
that
we
did
address
that
issue,
explicitly
or
not.
The
fact
is,
teachers
cannot
teach
without
learning
something
in
the
process,
and
Iyud
challenge
any
WA
to
say
they
have
never
had
a
conference
or
two
which
caused
them
to
question
their
own
brand
of
writing.
It
took
me
an
entire
year
to
realize
that
it
is
essential
to
be
unafraid
of
development
as
the
WA.
I
slowly
realized
that
my
own
writing
identity
was
changing
as
I
worked
with
students,
and
I
eventually
became
open
minded
enough
to
accept
it.
In
my
past
year
at
Lafayette,
I
took
eight
science
classes.
As
you
might
guess,
thirty
two
credit
hours
of
science
is
equal
to
about
four
writing
assignments.
That
is
no
exaggeration.
It
is
also
not
an
exaggeration
that
I
used
something
I
learned
from
my
work
as
a
WA
to
write
every
single
one
of
them.
Two
of
these
assignments
were
one
page
summaries
of
twelve
page
articles.
Once
again,
I
found
myself
in
a
dilemma
with
the
length
of
my
writing.
Only
this
time,
I
had
to
find
a
way
to
shut
up
rather
than
babble
on.
The
first
one
that
I
completed
barely
fit
on
one
page.
I
had
to
change
the
margins,
the
font,
and
the
spacing.
And
it
didnyut
fool
my
professor.
I
got
the
assignment
back
and
was
thoroughly
annoyed
when
I
saw
that
I
got
points
off
for
exceeding
the
length
limits
he
had
set.
Only
weeks
later
would
I
have
a
conference
with
a
female
writer
who
exceeded
the
page
limit
by
three
painfully
boring
but
well-written
pages.
She
became
annoyed
with
me
when
I
told
her
she
had
included
so
much
unnecessary
information
that
her
paper
had
become
excessive
in
length.
When
she
argued
that
it
was
all
relevant
to
her
topic,
I
agreed,
but
I
politely
explained
that
it
was
not
what
the
teacher
asked
for
and
that,
quite
frankly,
it
took
away
from
the
paper.
She
headed
off
in
a
huff,
and
I
became
indignant
at
her
attitude.
Only
later
on
after
the
conference
would
I
realize
that
I
had
seen
that
same
huff
before.
In
fact,
I
had
lived
it.
I,
too,
had
not
understood
that
when
a
professor
asks
for
an
assignment,
it
hurts
to
do
either
less
or
more
than
what
was
asked
of
you.
My
next
one
page
summary
was,
well,
one
page.
Margins,
font,
and
spacing
intact.
And
it
was
the
first
assignment
that
I
got
a
perfect
score
on
in
that
class.
This
student
wouldnyut
be
the
last
to
change
my
perspective.
On
one
single
assignment,
one
of
my
students
had
five
conferences
over
a
series
of
weeks
with
me
on
one
paper
before
it
turned
out
the
way
she
liked;
a
boy
in
her
class
sat
down
and
wrote
one
draft
of
the
same
assignment
without
taking
his
pen
off
the
paper
and
handed
it
in
for
a
perfect
grade
in
one
shot.
So
as
I
sat
writing
my
ten
page
monograph
the
very
night
before
it
was
due,
instead
of
cursing
myself
for
the
millionth
time
for
being
a
slacker,
I
cursed
myself
for
having
such
trying
writing
habits.
Ityus
true,
I
had
done
some
of
the
prewriting
exercises
that
my
female
student
had
done
weeks
before
the
paper
was
due,
and
it
was
critical
for
my
writing
process
that
I
had
done
them.
However,
I
had
also
tried
to
write
some
of
the
actual
paper
in
advance.
But
what
I
had
written
was
absolute
garbage,
and
I
had
to
rewrite
it
all.
Much
like
the
male
student,
I
had
to
pound
out
a
draft
in
one
sitting
right
before
the
assignment
was
due
for
me
to
actually
produce
good
writing.
That
was
the
first
time
that
I
actually
accepted
that
I
have
my
own
writing
style.
Of
course,
I
wasnyut
exactly
excited
that
my
writing
style
was
one
that
would
keep
me
up
until
four
in
the
morning
writing
about
a
fungus,
but
I
was
satisfied
when
my
paper
came
back
with
an
A
on
the
top.
With
the
exception
of
a
few
lab
reports,
that
is
my
entire
writing
history
from
the
past
year.
Now,
I
am
certain
that
my
students
did
not
consult
me
or
any
other
WA
on
every
writing
assignment
that
they
had
this
year.
Little
do
they
know
that
they
actually
assisted
me
on
every
one
that
I
completed.
