Writing
History
Being
a
WA
is
an
exciting
position
that
produces
better
writing
through
the
exchange
of
ideas
and
experiences.
I
have
discovered
this
while
working
on
the
WA
staff
the
past
two
semesters.
Even
though
I
had
heard
it
before,
it
wasnOt
until
I
saw
it
first
hand
that
I
realized
every
writer
has
a
unique
approach
to
developing
and
finishing
a
draft.
It
was
very
rewarding
for
me
to
begin
to
recognize
patterns
of
organization
and
process
among
my
students
and
use
that
knowledge
to
help
them
write
stronger
papers.
Last
fall
I
began
working
as
a
WA
for
Dr.
MilesO
FYS
D
NScience:
A
Human
Endeavour.O
Working
with
his
students
allowed
me
to
gain
more
confidence
in
my
writing
abilities.
I
was
very
nervous
during
my
first
few
conferences
D
I
was
afraid
the
students
may
not
take
me
seriously
or
may
not
be
in
need
of
my
help.
I
quickly
learned
that
I
was
more
valuable
to
their
progress
than
I
had
imagined.
Most
students
were
not
confident
in
their
writing
abilities
as
they
transitioned
to
college
writing.
My
support
and
encouragement
went
a
long
way
in
helping
them
take
risks
and
try
new
techniques
with
their
writing.
I
also
realized
that
I
needed
to
be
as
open-minded
as
possible.
Much
to
my
surprise,
students
occasionally
had
different
obstacles
on
the
same
paper.
I
soon
became
aware
that
each
writer
approaches
and
creates
a
draft
differently.
They
may
interpret
the
assignment
a
different
way.
They
may
organize
their
ideas
using
a
unique
rhythm.
I
enjoyed
hearing
about
these
varying
processes
because
they
gave
me
new
ideas
to
propose
to
other
students
and
to
use
in
my
own
writing.
One
of
the
most
important
things
I
began
focusing
on
within
my
studentOs
papers
was
the
overall
theme
or
message.
I
quickly
understood
that
picky
grammar
mistakes
and
run-on
sentences
should
be
addressed
but
remain
small
issues
compared
to
overall
ideas
and
delivery
techniques.
I
got
many
of
my
students
to
re-read
their
assignments
and
take
the
time
to
organize
their
message
before
they
started
writing.
Many
students
were
accustomed
to
producing
standard
five
paragraph
essays
throughout
high
school
and
carried
this
pattern
over
into
college.
Dry
conclusions,
body
paragraphs
lacking
transitions,
and
vague
introductions
were
signs
of
this
complacency.
I
challenged
my
students
to
look
more
at
what
they
were
trying
to
say
rather
than
how
to
fit
it
into
a
standard
format.
I
enjoyed
giving
them
new
ideas
pertaining
to
their
own
topic
and
suggesting
ways
to
better
present
their
existing
ones.
I
found
this
helpful
in
my
own
writing
as
well.
I
too
often
would
get
caught
up
in
a
particular
paragraph
or
idea
and
treat
it
more
like
its
own
mini-paper.
Some
of
my
supporting
ideas
in
papers
for
Medieval
or
Roman
history
almost
became
islands
lost
in
a
sea
of
seemingly
unrelated
thoughts.
Looking
at
my
overall
theme,
I
would
ask
more
than
ever,
NHow
does
this
relate
to
what
IOm
trying
to
convey?O
I
found
that
if
I
wanted
to
include
more
supporting
details
or
background
information,
I
shouldnOt
tag
it
on
as
a
list
and
assume
my
reader
will
tie
it
in
with
my
thesis.
I
incorporated
more
transitions,
explained
my
reasoning
behind
added
information,
and
provided
alternate
explanations
to
the
same
statement.
This
also
proved
helpful
in
Analytical
Chemistry,
where
our
lengthy
lab
reports
were
required
to
contain
detailed
background
on
alternate
methodologies
and
instrumentation.
Instead
of
gathering
this
information
in
one
spot
and
stamping
it
with
a
background
title,
I
explained
why
I
was
writing
about
it
and
how
it
related
to
what
I
studied.
This
improved
incorporation
of
ideas
and
supporting
evidence
helped
me
write
more
cohesive
reports.
Talking
about
these
topics
with
my
students
was
most
valuable
to
their
improvement.
I
also
challenged
myself
to
use
more
comprehensive
sources
in
my
papers.
Often
I
would
see
that
my
students,
myself
included,
would
take
a
small
piece
of
information
from
once
source
and
move
on
to
the
next
one.
It
was
more
about
having
a
source
than
using
a
source.
I
told
my
students
to
Nlook
into
this
idea
moreO
or
Ntell
me
more
about
thisO
as
I
saw
evidence
of
sources
not
being
used
to
their
fullest
potential.
I
too
saw
that
spending
more
time
with
a
particular
book
or
article
often
yielded
new
ideas
that
could
be
explained
in
my
own
work.
I
kept
my
approach
to
WA
responsibilities
fairly
consistent
during
the
last
two
semesters.
I
instructed
the
students
to
email
me
to
create
appointments
rather
than
distribute
a
list
of
available
time
slots.
This
allowed
the
students
to
work
around
their
own
schedules
and
take
the
initiative
themselves.
I
found
that
more
than
95%
of
the
time
I
was
available
to
meet
them
at
the
times
they
suggested.
I
also
believe
that
the
reason
I
only
had
two
missed
meetings
was
because
a
student
usually
will
remember
an
appointment
they
create
on
their
own.
I
also
stressed
that
NI
am
here
to
help
you.O
I
encouraged
students
to
meet
with
me
more
than
the
required
four
times
and
to
email
me
with
any
questions
or
suggestions.
This
helped
to
make
the
students
comfortable
around
me
early
on
in
the
semester.
I
was
against
looking
at
drafts
through
email;
all
WA
conferences
were
more
productive
in
person.
Writing
on
the
studentOs
draft
proved
very
helpful
to
me
and
the
student.
Some
disagree
with
this,
arguing
that
the
student
should
write
down
ideas
and
suggestions
on
their
own.
I
believe
that
even
if
a
few
words
are
written
such
as
NexplainO
or
Ntie
this
in
with
your
last
paragraphO
will
remind
and
encourage
the
student
to
act.
It
also
helps
to
remind
me
of
what
I
was
thinking
as
I
reviewed
the
draft.
I
want
my
student
to
leave
knowing
what
needs
to
be
addressed
and
why.
If
they
forget
to
include
something
during
our
conference,
they
may
leave
unprepared
to
revise.
If
I
do
most
of
the
writing
for
them,
they
are
pushed
to
pay
attention
and
understand.
Communication
is
absolutely
necessary
in
a
WA
conference.
Some
students
are
better
at
this
than
others.
I
found
my
most
productive
WA
conferences
to
be
when
both
I
and
the
student
were
fully
engaged
in
conversation
about
specific
ideas.
During
my
first
few
weeks
I
felt
that
I
should
do
most
of
the
talking
to
keep
the
studentOs
attention.
However,
I
discovered
that
if
I
reversed
that
role
and
let
the
student
explain
more
they
were
more
prone
to
ask
questions
and
address
the
issue
being
discussed.
After
I
saw
students
begin
to
zone
out
during
my
explanations,
I
realized
that
I
should
let
them
direct
our
meeting
and
let
me
assist
them
with
their
needs.
Some
students
were
shy
and
needed
that
encouragement
to
open
up
about
their
writing
process.
The
exchanging
of
new
ideas
proved
very
helpful
in
running
a
conference.
Students
would
explain
how
they
transitioned
to
a
new
idea
or
incorporated
a
source.
I
would
then
suggest
that
technique
to
another
student.
I
felt
that
the
more
conferences
I
had
about
a
particular
paper,
the
more
alternative
explanations
I
could
give
for
a
specific
problem.
This
coming
fall
I
hope
to
initiate
dialogue
early
on
D
to
engage
the
student
so
that
they
see
me
as
someone
looking
to
help
them,
not
as
a
tutor
who
has
all
the
answers.
I
also
like
to
see
a
student
more
than
once
during
the
construction
of
a
particular
paper.
That
way
I
can
evaluate
how
the
student
is
progressing
and
incorporating
suggestions.
I
would
rather
see
that
their
writing
is
developing
than
simply
hoping
for
the
best.
IOm
also
going
to
encourage
them
to
ask
more
questions.
I
want
to
make
them
become
stronger
writers
by
tackling
the
issues
that
bother
them
in
addition
to
what
stands
out
to
me.

To
new
WAs,
I
would
suggest
using
the
tools
around
you.
Talk
with
other
WAs
to
learn
through
their
experience
how
to
solve
a
problem
or
handle
a
writing
issue.
Be
sure
to
engage
yourself
on
the
Blackboard
site,
this
is
the
best
way
to
talk
with
other
WAs
and
faculty
since
everyone
is
linked
together.
If
you
come
across
something
important
for
developing
a
particular
draft
of
paper
topic,
alert
your
students
so
that
they
all
can
benefit.
Be
open-minded
with
your
students.
Understand
that
not
all
students
want
to
meet
with
you
or
have
an
interest
in
how
well
they
write;
they
may
just
be
looking
for
a
better
grade.
Be
patient
with
these
students
and
start
with
small
suggestions
to
keep
them
focused.
Address
any
concerns
with
the
WA
faculty;
they
are
there
to
help
you.
Also,
make
sure
you
keep
in
touch
with
your
assigned
professor
on
a
regular
basis.
Address
your
goals
for
the
semester
and
how
the
WA
program
works
(emphasizing
how
you
handle
your
job),
but
keep
in
mind
their
suggestions
and
policies.
Most
importantly:
listen.
Listen
to
your
studentOs
questions,
concerns,
ideas,
and
methods.
You
will
quickly
understand
what
it
is
they
are
looking
for
from
you
and
how
best
you
can
help
them.
You
will
also
pick
up
many
new
ideas
to
use
in
your
own
writing.
Treat
them
as
an
equal
and
they
will
look
to
you
as
a
peer
who
is
trained
to
initiate
dialogue
about
writing.
They
will
respect
your
patience
and
come
to
you
for
advice.
