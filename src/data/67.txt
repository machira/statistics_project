JOSE

LITERACY
NARRATIVE:
MY
EXPERIENCE
AS
A
WRITER
AUGUST
22,
1996.
The
earliest
memory
I
have
as
a
writer
dates
back
to
the
very
first
day
of
classes
in
my
second
grade
of
elementary
school
when
everyone
in
the
classroom
was
asked
to
write
about
their
summer
vacation.
The
reason
I
remember
this
is
because
it
was
the
first
time
I
was
asked
to
write
a
composition
in
English.
That
moment
in
my
life
was
crucial
for
me
because
from
then
on
I
would
be
writing
in
both
English
and
Spanish.
The
fact
that
I
was
raised
in
Puerto
Rico
shaped
my
education
in
a
bilingual
environment.
It
was
difficult
for
me
to
start
speaking
and
writing
in
English
with
barely
any
language
background
from
the
school
I
had
previously
attended.
As
time
went
on,
my
teachers
taught
me
the
basics
within
the
language
such
as
diction,
word
usage,
subject-verb
agreement,
etc.
I
was
tested
in
readings
such
as
poetry,
short
stories,
and
novels.
Teachers
assigned
book
reports
where
they
asked
the
students
to
analyze
different
novels
and
make
summaries
about
the
readings.
Although
my
language
and
reading
skills
were
good,
teachers
mentioned
that
I
needed
to
improve
my
writing
skills.
Those
comments
made
me
feel
a
bit
pessimistic
about
my
abilities
as
a
good
writer.
But
this
feeling
would
not
last
long.
I
remember
an
occasion
where
one
of
my
teachers
asked
me
to
write
about
'the
meaning
of
Christmas'.
One
of
the
comments
she
made
in
reference
to
my
writing
skills
was
that
I
was
able
to
express
my
ideas
in
a
very
precise
and
concise
way.
This
comment
completely
changed
my
attitude
and
increased
my
confidence
as
a
writer,
but
still
I
knew
I
had
much
to
learn.
It
was
not
until
I
went
to
Canada
to
visit
my
cousins
for
a
summer
that
I
acquired
new
vocabulary
and
developed
a
new
sense
on
how
to
improve
my
writing.
I
learned
new
words
in
the
English
language
which
I
had
never
heard
or
used
until
then.
After
this
experience,
I
found
out
in
further
school
assignments
that
the
way
I
used
to
write
had
changed.
The
tendency
of
translating
my
ideas
from
Spanish
to
English
as
I
wrote
had
disappeared.
The
fact
that
I
was
frequently
in
contact
during
that
summer
with
the
English
language
paved
the
way
so
I
could
improve
my
writing
skills
in
the
future.
As
I
began
high
school
I
started
to
show
this
improvement.
The
teachers
were
aware
that
they
had
to
prepare
students
for
college
writing,
in
particular,
those
who
were
planning
to
continue
their
studies
in
the
United
States.
I
began
a
new
stage
in
my
life
as
a
writer
as
I
received
more
writing
practice
and
new
challenges
were
set.
Monthly
papers
analyzing
some
of
the
readings
found
in
books
and
journals
assigned
for
the
English
class
were
very
common
as
it
helped
the
student
develop
the
skills
necessary
to
become
a
good
writer.
We
were
introduced
to
computers
and
were
taught
word
processing
as
a
way
to
improve
presentation
and
increase
our
preparation
for
college
writing.
I
remember
that
in
tenth
grade
my
best
experience
was
with
poetry.
Each
student
was
assigned
a
poem
to
be
recited
and
analyzed
-in
front
of
the
classroom
every
Friday.
Although
that
course
was
not
designed
to
write
intensively,
it
did
help
in
certain
ways.
It
was
by
observing
and
analyzing
the
words
of
poets
like
Robert
Frost
that
I
discovered
that
writing
was
much
more
than
simple
words,
it
was
a
form
of
art.
It
was
in
my
junior
year
that
I
began
writing
in
a
more
intensive
way.
The
interest
I
had
for
poetry
led
me
into
writing
some
poems
in
Spanish
during
my
free
time.
Although
I
enjoyed
this
experience
very
much,
the
many
extracurricular
activities
I
was
involved
with
forced
me
to
stop
writing
poetry
for
a
while.
On
the
other
hand,
I
had
research
papers
to
do
during
the
academic
year
for
my
English
class
which
included
intensive
reading
and
writing.
I
still
remember
that
in
the
first
week
of
classes
the
students
were
assigned
the
first
research
paper
for
the
semester.
We
were
supposed
to
search
for
a
topic
of
our
own
choice
and
develop
a
theme
which
we
would
further
had
to
analyze
in
detail.
We
started
by
having
interviews
with
professionals
in
the
field
and
as
time
progressed
more
information
was
gathered
from
articles,
books,
journals,
and
computers.
Although
I
thought
that
my
paper
was
almost
perfect
it
did
not
happen
that
way.
Some
of
the
comments
that
the
teacher
made
in
my
paper
showed
that
I
had
good
ideas,
but
still
there
were
imperfections
in
the
way
I
grouped
them
together
and
in
my
abilities
to
express
them.
Doing
research
was
not
easy,
but
it
served
as
a
great
experience
and
training
as
I
prepared
myself
for
a
more
formal
type
of
writing.
I
had
one
year
left
to
prepare
myself
for
college
and
I
knew
that
writing
was
essential
for
me
if
I
was
going
to
meet
my
short
term
goals
of
getting
into
a
competitive
school.
During
my
senior
year,
the
school
work
load
decreased
so
we
could
spend
more
time
preparing
ourselves
for
college
entrance
examinations.
I
considered
that
writing
good
essays
were
one
of
the
most
essential
and
important
things
to
do
while
filling
out
the
different
university
applications.
Writing
about
environmental
issues,
education,
and
other
important
questions
in
these
essays
gave
me
some
new
perspectives
on
what
to
consider
as
a
college
writer.
I
realized
that
in
order
to
write
an
excellent
essay,
I
would
not
only
play
the
role
as
the
writer
but
also
become
that
actual
reader.
I
knew
that
I
had
to
describe
myself
to
the
person
reading
those
essays.
Therefore
writing
would
serve
as
the
unique
medium
of
those
people
who
were
trying
to
know
the
person
I
was
and
how
I
thought.
I
personally
think
that
the
good
essays
I
wrote
for
the
college
applications
and
the
hard
work
I
went
through
my
high
school
career
to
improve
in
my
writing
skills
helped
me
reach
the
goals
I
had
of
being
accepted
in
excellent
academic
institutions.
But
the
question
of
how
well
I
was
prepared
for
college
writing
was
still
there.
At
that
moment
I
really
did
not
know
what
to
expect
with
respect
to
my
first
year
seminar
and
writing
courses
at
Lafayette
College.
Most
important,
I
was
more
interested
with
courses
related
to
engineering
due
to
my
major
in
Civil
Engineering.
As
time
went
on,
I
started
appreciating
more
my
writing
course.
The
fact
that
the
course
I
was
taking
dealt
with
religion
in
Eastern
European
countries
made
me
feel
more
interested
as
I
could
free
my
mind
considering
non-engineering
topics.
I
still
remember
the
first
writing
assignment
I
had
in
my
First
Year
Seminar
religion
course.
I
was
supposed
to
choose
an
open
theme
and
do
some
research.
I
will
not
forget
my
decision
to
start
writing
the
essay
using
the
MLA
format
and
many
other
writing
techniques
learned
in
high
school.
Although
I
felt
confident
about
this
paper,
the
grade
I
received
for
it
was
below
the
one
I
expected.
The
professor
made
some
good
comments
about
my
ideas
and
writing
abilities,
but
I
had
to
accept
the
fact
that
there
was
still
much
experience
to
be
acquired
in
order
to
improve.
It
was
with
the
help
of
the
writing
associate
assigned
for
my
class,
that
I
started
to
comprehend
the
mistakes
I
was
doing
while
writing.
Every
time
we
both
met
in
order
to
discuss
an
assignment
or
a
paper
she
showed
me
new
ways
on
how
to
improve
my
writing.
In
order
to
organize
my
ideas
I
started
making
outlines
which
in
s.ome
sense
also
helped
me
develop
new
ways
for
exploring
different
themes
about
the
readings
I
made.
At
the
same
time
I
was
brainstorming
on
some
of
the
ideas,
it
became
easier
for
me
to
be
concise
and
organized.
Overall
my
writing
associate
served
as
a
trainer
and
example
of
an
excellent
writer
and
friend.
During
my
second
semester
at
Lafayette
College
I
shared
the
experience
with
many
students
working
with
poetry
in
our
writing
course.
Being
poetry
one
of
my
favorite
subjects,
I
began
the
semester
with
great
expectations.
Our
professor
assigned
weekly
essays
with
our
comments
about
the
poetry
readings.
Engineering
students
do
not
receive
much
practice
in
writing
skills,
therefore
this
class
served
as
a
good
training
for
writing.
But
the
class
was
not
only
about
poetry.
The
professor
was
an
excellent
mentor
as
she
taught
us
ways
on
how
to
improve
our
writing.
One
of
the
best
memories
I
have
from
Lafayette
College
has
been
a
comment
this
professor
made
on
one
of
my
papers.
She
asked
if
I
ever
considered
being
a
Writing
Associate.
I
knew
that
enjoyed
writing
and
that
I
had
improved
a
lot
but
I
never
thought
of
becoming
a
student
in
such
an
important
position.
The
good
experience
that
I
had
with
my
previous
Writing
Associate
influenced
my
decision
of
becoming
one
of
those
students
who
would
help
others
in
their
journey
through
their
first
year
of
college
writing.
