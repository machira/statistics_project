I
can
write
my
name!
K
a
t
y.
Four
letters.
I
can
do
it
again!
K
a
t
y.
I
am
the
first
one!
Miss
Doran
said
good
job!
Katy
can
write
her
name.
Who
else
can
write
their
name?
My
first
moment
as
a
writer
was
a
very
proud
one.
In
fact,
it
quite
possibly
may
have
been
my
proudest
moment
as
a
writer
ever.
I
had
been
practicing
all
morning,
but
it
seemed
more
like
days.
The
four
little
letters
were
written
on
a
bright
pink
nametag
at
the
top
of
my
tiny
kindergarten
desk.
I
stared
at
them.
K
is
for
kangaroo,
A
is
for
alligator,
t
is
for
turtle,
and
Y
is
for
yak.
I
was
very
familiar
with
these
letters.
By
now
I
could
sing
the
alphabet
song
in
my
sleep.
Confidence
was
brewing
inside
me.
I
had
written
all
these
letters
before.
I
was
a
master
at
writing
OKOsO
and
OtOsO,
but
I
remembered
curvy
lowercase
OaOsO
and
OyOsO
being
much
trickier.
But
even
so,
I
was
a
lot
better
now.
How
hard
could
it
be?
I
glanced
over
at
Alexander
sitting
next
to
me.
Tears
were
welling
in
his
eyes.
ONine!O
he
was
croaking.
ONine
whole
letters!O
Evidently,
Alexander,
like
me,
had
counted
the
number
of
letters
in
his
name.
Unfortunately,
he
counted
enough
to
make
him
cry.
I
couldnOt
really
blame
him.
I
didnOt
know
what
math
was
yet,
but
I
knew
nine
came
way
after
four.
Poor
Alexander.
He
was
a
bit
overwhelmed
and
began
to
require
the
attention
of
both
teachers
plus
the
parent
volunteer.
I
shared
sympathetic
glances
with
Kim
and
Jack
who
were
sitting
across
the
table.
We
considered
ourselves
lucky.
The
teacher
assured
Alexander
he
could
start
off
by
just
writing
OAlexO
before
moving
on
to
OAlexander.O
He
sighed
in
relief.
I
gripped
my
glittery
purple
pencil
in
my
right
hand
and
the
blank
sheet
of
lined
paper
with
my
left.
With
one
downward
stroke
and
two
slanted
ones
I
masterfully
crafted
the
first
letter
of
my
name,
OKO.
I
looked
around
and
noticed
my
fellow
kindergartners
had
all
done
the
same.
Next
for
me
was
a
lowercase
letter
OaO.
I
sat
and
contemplated
for
a
moment:
in
which
direction
should
I
move
my
pencil
in
order
to
make
the
circle
of
the
OaO?
I
was
very
indecisive
so
after
a
silent
round
of
eenie-meenie-minee-mo
in
my
head
I
chose
to
go
with
the
counterclockwise
direction
(It
must
have
been
a
good
decision
since
that
is
what
I
do
to
this
day!).
In
execution
the
circle
turned
out
a
bit
oblong,
but
the
tail
of
the
OaO
was
just
right
so
I
was
pretty
satisfied.
The
OtO
was
even
easier
than
the
OKO.
Perfectly
straight
and
angled.
Jack
was
still
working
on
his
Oa,O
Kim
seemed
perplexed
about
where
to
even
start
her
Om,O
and
Alexander
was
on
his
fifth
attempt
at
an
OA.O
All
of
his
other
OAOsO
looked
fine
to
me,
but
I
guess
he
was
a
bit
of
a
perfectionist.
I
had
only
one
more
letter
to
go.
The
OyO
was
going
to
be
a
little
tricky.
I
knew
I
had
the
option
of
making
my
OyO
either
straight
or
curvy.
I
had
seen
it
written
both
ways
and
thus
knew
it
was
up
to
me
to
pick
my
style.
I
quickly
settled
on
curvy
rather
than
straight.
I
would
be
a
little
harder,
I
knew,
but
curvy
was
just
so
much
prettier.
I
took
a
deep
breath
in
anticipation
of
successfully
finishing
my
first-ever
written
word.
I
first
focused
on
forming
a
OuO
and
then
a
OjO
below
the
OuO
to
complete
the
OyO.
Even
at
five
years
old,
big
tasks
seem
easier
when
broken
down
into
parts.
I
had
never
concentrated
so
hard
in
my
entire
five-year
life.
I
traced
my
pencil
very
slowly
and
steadily
on
the
lined
paper,
making
sure
not
to
slip.
First
came
the
OuO,
and
then
the
OjO
to
complete
the
letter
OyO,
just
as
I
had
pictured.
I
put
down
my
sparkly
purple
pencil
to
admire
what
I
had
just
done.
It
was
the
single
greatest
thing
I
could
remember
doing
in
a
very
long
time
(bike
riding
had
proven
less
successful).
At
that
moment,
I
knew
IOd
be
able
to
write
anything
I
wanted
to.
Little
did
my
five-year-old
self
know,
IOd
soon
be
able
to
use
writing
in
not
only
a
simplistic
way,
but
also
in
an
emotional
and
therapeutic
way.
Dear
Diary,
A
boy
just
kissed
me!
His
name
is
Peter!
And
by
the
way
I
am
at
sleep
away
soccer
camp!
Wow!
It
was
a
little
gross.
I
kind
of
expected
it
but
I
wasnOt
ready.
We
were
in
the
fort
in
the
dark
and
he
kind
of
landed
on
my
nose.
He
asked
me
to
go
to
the
camp
dance
tomorrow
night.
But
what
if
Matt
sees?
IOm
afraid
heOs
going
to
tease
me
about
it.
HeOll
tell
Mom
and
Dad!
Oh
no!
That
would
be
awful.
TheyOll
make
fun
of
me
the
whole
car
ride
home.
Am
I
allowed
to
have
a
boyfriend?
IOm
not
sure.
IOll
have
to
break
up
with
Peter.
IOll
let
you
know
how
it
goes.
Sincerely,
Katy
My
writing
had
come
a
long
way
since
my
kindergarten
days.
My
handwriting,
too.
At
around
the
age
of
eight,
I
began
realizing
that
text
wasnOt
just
for
making
names
and
words
and
sentences,
but
that
it
could
also
be
used
for
reflecting
and
telling
stories.
Being
far
away
from
home
that
summer,
having
no
close
friends,
and
being
required
to
OsleepO
on
my
bunk
in
silence
for
an
hour
each
day
led
me
to
explore
different
ways
of
handling
my
little
daily
dilemmas.
At
first
I
tried
talking
to
the
other
girls
about
it,
but
we
rarely
were
able
to
spend
time
with
each
other
outside
of
practice,
meals,
and
bunk
time.
Neither
the
soccer
field
nor
the
cafeteria
seemed
an
appropriate
place
to
disclose
my
secrets.
Soon
enough
I
was
boiling
inside.
My
mind
was
completely
consumed
and
I
had
to
let
something
out,
somehow.
During
bunk
time
that
day
I
looked
around
and
noticed
some
of
the
other
girls
were
sitting
quietly
in
their
beds.
They
were
active,
not
sleeping.
They
werenOt
listening
to
music,
but
they
werenOt
reading
either.
They
were
moving
one
hand
back
and
forth
a
little
bitE
they
were
writing!
They
were
expressingE
communicatingE
creatingE
all
by
themselves.
I
had
never
really
thought
of
those
activities
as
being
solitary
before.
And
if
other
girls
were
doing
it,
why
couldnOt
I?
Summer
camp
was
all
about
fitting
in
back
then,
anyways.
But
with
a
certain
style
and
flare,
of
course.
I
immediately
jumped
from
my
bed
and
snatched
a
mini
notebook
my
mom
had
tucked
away
in
my
duffle
bag.
She
must
have
known
I
would
end
up
needing
a
pencil
and
paper.
She
always
predicted
little
things
like
that.
I
hopped
up
back
on
my
bunk
(this
time
with
my
head
on
the
opposite
end,
for
style
and
flare
and
a
little
sense
of
privacy)
and
just
let
go.
Every
little
thing
that
had
been
on
my
mind
during
the
past
week
came
spilling
out
of
the
tip
of
my
pen.
I
felt
such
relief,
like
finding
a
lost
wallet
or
finally
peeing
after
a
long
car
ride.
Although
my
then
eight-year-old
thoughts
now
seem
ridiculously
petty
to
my
now
twenty-one
year
old
self,
they
were
all
I
knew
and
cared
about
at
the
time.
They
needed
to
be
released
as
much
as
a
butterfly
from
its
cocoon.
They
needed
to
be
recognized,
dealt
with,
and
then
laughed
at
years
later.
Instantaneously,
writing
had
become
my
greatest
liberation,
my
greatest
tool,
and
my
greatest
pleasure.
Starting
in
high
school
and
continuing
in
college,
the
role
of
writing
in
my
life
took
somewhat
of
a
sour
turn.
Instead
of
something
to
look
forward
so,
writing
had
become
something
I
dreaded.
Instead
of
being
willing
to
write
to
Omy
heartOs
content,O
I
was
now
forced
to
write
O4
to
5
pages,
double
spacedO
without
any
contestation.
And
writing
was
no
longer
about
colorful
pens
and
pencils
and
notebooks,
it
was
about
Times
New
Roman
12pt
font
and
1-inch
page
margins.
Not
that
technology
is
a
negative
thing
(in
fact,
I
do
appreciate
spell
check!),
but
at
the
time
I
felt
as
though
creativity
was
being
stripped
from
me.
My
writing
had
always
been
just
a
OthingO
I
did
for
myself
in
my
spare
time
to
unwind
and
feel
better
about
my
mood.
I
didnOt
want
to
share
it.
I
was
afraid
to
be
judged,
afraid
to
be
seen
differently
because
of
my
arguments
or
opinions
or
crazy
ideas.
Growing
up,
I
was
never
so
outspoken
verbally.
I
would
always
save
the
deep
stuff
for
my
journal.
Fortunately
or
not,
my
writing
would
have
to
be
shared.
It
would
have
to
become
something
for
other
people,
too,
not
just
me.
