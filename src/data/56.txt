LITERACY
NARRATIVE
It
all
began
one
Christmas
night
about
twelve
years
ago
when
I
was
sitting
in
my
room
playing
with
my
Star
Wars
toys.
I
was
making
them
have
a
huge
war
between
two
strong
armies,
and
it
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
original
plot
of
Star
Wars.
I
was
so
much
into
it
that
I
never
realized
my
grandfather
was
also
in
the
room
watching
me
play.
He
asked
me
what
I
was
doing.
As
a
nine
year
old
kid,
I
was
very
much
disturbed
by
the
very
presence
of
an
adult
in
the
room.
I
lost
all
my
concentration.
My
world,
and
the
world
I
had
created
with
the
toys,
and
my
grandfather's
world
were
three
extremes.
Of
course
I
did
not
want
to
open
up
at
first
and
rejected
to
tell
him
the
plot.
I
even
went
on
further
to
tell
him
to
leave
the
room
and
close
the
door
behind
him.
He
laughed
at
first,
and
then
he
convinced
me
to
talk.
Thus
I
started
talking.
I
told
him
how
the
two
armies
were
formed,
I
told
him
how
cruel
one
of
the
armies
was,
I
told
him
all
about
the
specific
characters
including
the
good
guys
and
the
evil
leader
of
the
cruel
army
etc.
He
listened
without
saying
a
word.
Having
regained
my
concentration,
I
did
not
even
care
whether
he
was
listening
to
me
or
not.
I
was
just
talking
like
a
motor,
reliving
the
plot,
correcting
the
details,
and
building
up
to
the
conclusion
which
I
had
not
played
yet.
My
grandfather
smiled
again.
He
was
impressed.
It
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
I
had
managed
to
impress
my
father's
father.
He
then
asked
me
how
many
games
I
play
like
this
in
a
month.
I
told
him
I
did
not
know,
and
then
he
made
his
point:
I
was
forgetting
my
old
games.
And
the
only
way
to
replay
the
same
game
would
be
to
write
the
plot
down
somewhere.
Writing?
I
never
thought
I
could
write
anything
aside
from
the
assignments
from
school.
But
somehow
I
loved
the
idea.
Getting
a
pencil
and
a
little
notebook
ready,
I
started
writing
down
the
whole
thing,
from
beginning
to
end.
I
gave
much
more
depth
to
the
characters
of
the
main
guy
and
how
actual
war
takes
place:
the
explosions,
the
murders,
the
betrayals
etc.
And
the
more
I
wrote,
the
more
I
liked
writing.
I
wrote
and
I
wrote
and
I
filled
up
the
whole
notebook.
I
called
my
story
The
Rebels.
I
read
it
over
and
over
again,
and
I
loved
my
first
work.
That
night
I
decided
to
be
a
writer.
It
was
quite
a
long
night.
That
story
was
followed
by
others,
and
soon
I
had
a
bookshelf
full
of
stories
that
I
wrote.
I
enjoyed
writing
so
much
that
I
was
inviting
friends
over
to
watch
me
play
my
stories
to
them
using
the
action
figures.
They
were
watching
my
stories
like
watching
a
movie.
This
made
me
believe
that
I
was
doing
something
right.
After
a
while,
my
grandfather
invited
me
to
his
house,
and
he
told
me
he
was
going
to
show
me
something
that
I
would
fall
in
love
with.
We
went
inside
into
one
of
the
not-enterable
taboo
rooms,
and
he
opened
this
huge
dusty
case
and
took
out
a
big,
old
typewriter.
I
was
not
interested
in
it
first
because
it
seemed
too
complicated
for
me.
However,
after
seeing
him
type
a
page
or
two
of
one
of
my
stories,
I
really
fell
in
love
with
it.
My
stories
now
looked
more
like
printed
books.
They
had
covers,
they
had
acknowledgements,
they
had
illustrations,
they
had
typos;
they
had
everything
the
books
I
saw
at
school
had.
I
typed
almost
all
of
my
stories
onto
pieces
of
paper
and
I
even
binded
some
of
them.
I
really
enjoyed
this
new
hobby
of
mine.
Unfortunately
after
a
couple
of
years
my
old
stories
started
not
to
satisfy
me.
I
was
growing
up
and
the
audience
for
my
stories
was
also
growing
up.
There
was
no
future
in
that
business
anymore.
I
guess
I
forgot
to
mention
before
that
after
a
while
I
started
to
charge
the
kids
who
came
over
to
watch
me
perform.
Anyway,
as
I
got
more
serious
about
my
classes
and
life
in
general,
I
started
to
write
less
and
less.
My
final
attempt
was
at
a
novel
which
I
never
finished.
That
unfinished
novel
killed
all
inspiration
in
me.
Years
passed
and
the
only
thing
I
wrote
was
again
the
assignments
given
at
school.
These
assignments
included
writing
stuff
about
my
country,
about
a
historical
figure,
about
some
region
in
the
world
etc.
They
were
mostly
research
papers.
I
never
enjoyed
them
cause
I
could
never
show
any
creativity.
The
ogre
inside
me
was
fast
asleep,
and
seemed
like
it
could
never
be
woken
up
again.
I
actually
cannot
remember
how
I
started
to
enjoy
writing
again.
It
must
have
been
sometime
during
high
school
where
I
got
the
chance
to
read
more
and
think
more
and
write
more
in
general.
The
literature
courses
started
to
be
more
fun
than
ever
and
I
seemed
to
be
writing
more
than
ever.
I
wrote
poetry,
I
wrote
fiction,
I
wrote
non-fiction
research
papers,
I
wrote
criticisms
--
I
basically
wrote
everything.
We
even
formed
a
newspaper
with
some
friends
in
secondary
school.
It
was
secret
from
the
school
administration
because
according
to
certain
laws
we
had
to
have
a
faculty
advisor
to
approve
our
work.
Plus,
we
were
criticizing
the
school
a
lot
in
our
articles.
We
had
to
write
with
a
strong
language
because
we
were
making
important
points
about
some
of
the
stupidities
we
saw
around
us,
but
we
also
had
to
be
careful
with
the
wording
because
a
copy
could
eventually
be
caught
by
the
administration
and
that
could
have
put
us
into
trouble.
This
was
a
very
unique
experience
which
I
know
I
will
never
again
have.
And
now
that
I
think
of
it,
with
the
mind
I
have
today,
I
don't
think
I
could
dare
to
do
something
like
that.
I
guess
we
are
all
more
courageous
when
we
are
younger.
Another
interesting
aspect
of
my
writing
was
that
I
wrote
in
different
languages.
I
wrote
in
English,
in
Turkish,
and
even
sometimes
in
French.
My
French
is
actually
so
bad
that
all
I
write
is
letters
to
this
friend
of
mine
who
lives
in
France.
After
a
while
I
started
to
write
to
him
in
English
as
well.
Then
one
day
I
came
to
Lafayette.
I
had
a
lot
of
writing
courses
in
my
first
year.
I
wrote
history
research
papers,
I
wrote
mathematical
lab
reports,
I
wrote
analysis
papers
about
what
Copernicus
did
back
in
the
sixteenth
century
etc.
They
were
all
fun,
but
I
enjoyed
the
English
110
course
the
most
because
we
had
a
chance
to
write
about
personal
experiences.
I
believe
the
more
personal
the
writing
gets,
the
more
complex
it
also
gets,
which
makes
the
piece
in
general
a
more
real
paper
that
comes
from
the
inside
of
the
author.
Non-fiction
is
also
exciting,
but
is
not
too
related
to
personal
writings.
A
couple
of
my
professors
supported
me
to
become
a
Writing
Associate
and
I
listened
to
their
advice.
I
like
reading
and
writing
and
commenting
on
other
people's
writings.
Therefore,
the
Writing
Associate
position
was
the
perfect
job
for
me.
After
becoming
a
Writing
Associate,
I
started
to
feel
much
more
comfortable
about
my
own
writings.
I
felt
like
I
was
an
authority
on
writing
well.
This
gave
me
a
pleasure
not
a
lot
of
things
did.
Papers,
essays,
assignments:
I
now
feel
very
sympathetic
towards
them.
In
fact,
I
don't
sacrifice
a
minute
of
my
sleep
for
short
one
page
assignments
anymore.
The
average
time
it
takes
me
to
complete
a
two-three
page
paper
has
decreased
significantly
in
the
last
year.
Five-six
page
papers
take
about
a
short
evening,
and
twelve-plus
page
assignments
only
a
day.
Yes,
I
have
managed
to
enjoy
writing
for
years,
and
I
know
I
will
as
long
as
my
fingers
function.
