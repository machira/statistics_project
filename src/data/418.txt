WA
Summer
Assignment
Literacy
Narrative
August

2004
Watching
a
young
child
learn
to
write
his
or
her
name
always
brings
a
smile
to
my
face.
The
big
awkward
letters
that
never
seem
to
fit
on
just
one
line,
remind
me
of
my
first
writing
experiences.
Most
children
learn
to
write
their
name
either
from
their
parents
or
teachers.
The
next
thing
you
know
every
scrap
of
paper
and
maybe
a
few
walls
have
been
covered
with
their
newly
learned
John
Hancock.
My
mother
taught
me
to
write
my
name
when
I
was
three
and
a
half
years
old.
I
wanted
to
be
the
big
shot
at
preschool.
Once
I
was
able
to
write
my
name
and
I
began
reading,
the
writing
process
quickly
followed.
By
second
grade,
I
was
writing
and
NpublishingO
stories.
My
second
grade
teacher
would
have
us
write
drafts
of
our
stories.
We
would
then
meet
with
her
and
type
the
pages
on
a
typewriter,
and
once
my
school
became
technologically
advanced,
a
computer.
After
the
pages
were
printed,
we
would
illustrate
the
pages
and
bind
the
pages
together
into
a
book.
At
the
end
of
the
school
year
we
had
a
Publishing
Party.
Each
student
got
to
choose
one
of
their
stories
and
read
it
in
front
of
the
class
and
their
parents.
If
I
remember
correctly,
I
won
an
award
that
year
for
the
most
stories
published.
Twelve
years
later,
I
still
have
the
video
tape
of
our
party
and
all
of
the
stories
I
published
that
year.
My
stories
were
primarily
about
my
family,
friends
and
pets.
As
I
reread
the
stories,
I
notice
how
I
embellished
the
truth
in
some
cases
or
I
would
write
about
the
smallest
thing
that
had
happened
as
if
it
was
the
greatest
moment
of
my
life.
We
also
kept
journals
in
second
grade.
We
would
have
free
writing
time
every
day
where
we
could
make
entries
in
two
different
journals.
One
journal
was
kept
private
and
we
were
able
to
write
anything
we
wanted.
In
the
second
journal
we
would
write
entries
to
our
teacher
and
then
she
would
write
back
to
us.
Flipping
through
these
journals,
I
could
see
how
much
progress
I
had
made
in
a
year.
By
the
end
of
the
year,
my
letters
fit
on
one
line
and
my
spelling
was
much
improved.
I
was
beginning
to
write
longer
stories
and
the
content
was
becoming
more
meaningful.
By
the
end
of
the
year,
I
was
able
to
convey
my
thoughts
and
feelings
through
writing.
By
the
time
I
started
fourth
grade,
creative
story
writing
was
put
aside
for
research
papers
and
news
articles.
In
fourth
grade,
we
had
to
do
research
projects
based
on
an
area
of
the
world
we
were
studying,
such
as
Switzerland
or
Morocco.
I
distinctly
remember
my
project
for
Switzerland.
I
chose
to
research
Swiss
fashion
and
clothing.
This
led
to
many
trips
to
the
library
with
my
mother,
since
the
internet
was
not
yet
popular.
After
researching
my
topic,
I
made
a
Swiss
costume
for
a
Barbie.
I
was
then
left
with
writing
the
paper.
I
remember
lying
on
the
same
floor
I
am
lying
on
as
I
type
this
paper,
but
instead
of
a
computer,
I
had
a
stack
of
lined
paper
and
an
erasable
pen.
Being
the
perfectionist
that
I
am,
I
would
start
writing
the
whole
paper
again
with
every
mistake
I
made.
By
the
end
of
the
paper
I
had
wasted
a
few
trees
and
I
had
a
perfect
neatly
handwritten
paper.
The
papers
and
projects
you
spend
the
most
time
on
seem
to
be
the
most
memorable.
Along
with
school
assignments,
free
and
fun
writing
projects
also
helped
mold
the
type
of
writer
I
have
become.
During
summer
vacations
and
over
weekends,
I
would
make
books
with
the
two
girls
who
lived
next
door.
We
would
take
plain
white
sheets
of
paper
and
use
a
ruler
to
make
lines.
We
would
then
cut
the
paper
into
certain
shapes
depending
on
what
our
stories
were
going
to
be
about,
such
as
the
shape
of
a
flower
if
a
flower
was
part
of
the
story.
We
would
then
write
our
stories
and
illustrate
the
pages
and
cover.
When
we
had
all
finished
our
books
we
would
staple
the
pages
together
and
then
read
them
out
loud
to
each
other.
We
did
not
need
our
teachers
to
assign
writing
projects.
I
also
kept
a
journal
for
several
years
in
elementary
school
and
middle
school.
I
would
write
a
couple
of
pages
every
night
before
I
went
to
bed
about
what
had
happened
in
my
day
or
how
I
was
feeling.
In
fifth
grade,
the
stages
of
writing
were
stressed.
The
process
began
with
brainstorming
an
idea,
followed
by
research,
and
then
note
taking
on
note
cards.
An
outline
was
then
carefully
planned
out
before
a
rough
draft
was
started.
Once
the
rough
draft
was
completed
it
was
then
reviewed
by
classmates
and
the
teacher.
The
final
draft
was
then
handed
in
with
all
of
the
subsequent
work
for
a
final
grade.
An
assignment
I
clearly
remember
was
when
we
had
to
write
directions
on
how
to
make
something.
I
chose
to
write
directions
on
how
to
make
a
wreath.
Other
students
wrote
directions
on
how
to
make
a
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwich
or
on
how
to
tie
your
shoes.
Next
time
you
buy
your
wreath
at
Christmas
time,
imagine
a
fifth
grader
trying
to
instruct
you
on
how
to
make
it.
To
say
the
least,
this
was
not
the
easiest
project.
Looking
back
on
it,
elementary
school
was
a
breeze
compared
to
what
would
lie
ahead
in
middle
school.
I
no
longer
had
the
same
teacher
for
every
subject,
but
instead
I
would
have
one
teacher
for
English
and
another
for
reading
and
spelling.
When
I
was
in
sixth
grade,
the
local
Veteran
Organization
in
my
area
proposed
a
writing
contest
based
on
why
is
it
important
to
salute
the
American
Flag.
The
winner
was
chosen
based
on
who
wrote
the
best
essay.
Surprisingly,
I
won
this
contest.
I
was
shocked,
because
I
remember
thinking
that
this
was
not
an
example
of
my
best
writing.
Apparently
the
Veterans
who
judged
the
essays
felt
otherwise.
When
I
was
in
middle
school,
each
grade
had
a
focus.
Sixth
graders
studied
the
Pacific
Rim,
seventh
graders
studied
Medieval
Times
and
the
Holocaust,
and
eighth
graders
studied
Greek
Mythology.
Each
subject
taught
material
that
focused
on
the
specific
topics.
My
first
real
research
papers
were
written
in
sixth
grade.
I
still
have
my
stacks
of
note
cards,
all
carefully
color
coordinated
to
match
the
area
of
the
outline
the
notes
fell
under.
My
first
research
paper
was
about
the
different
traditions
and
ways
Christmas
is
celebrated
around
the
world.
This
assignment
was
just
the
warm
up
for
the
Pacific
Rim
paper.
Compared
to
college
research
papers,
my
first
research
papers
had
a
much
more
complicated
process.
Although
the
research
papers
I
write
today
are
longer
in
length,
I
am
not
required
to
hand
in
copies
of
my
research
material,
note
cards,
outlines,
and
sometimes
rough
drafts.
Being
required
to
go
through
each
process
and
having
thorough
notes
and
a
structured
outline,
prepared
me
for
the
papers
I
am
required
to
write
today.
When
I
was
in
middle
school,
my
family
bought
our
very
first
computer.
Teachers
also
started
accepting
assignments
that
had
been
typed
on
the
computer.
Eighth
grade
was
the
last
year
I
was
required
to
hand
in
note
cards
and
outlines.
Research
could
now
be
completed
on
the
internet
instead
of
the
library.
By
the
time
I
started
my
freshmen
year
in
high
school,
assignments
would
not
be
accepted
if
they
were
not
typed.
It
is
hard
to
imagine
how
I
would
complete
my
lab
reports
and
research
papers
without
instant
access
to
the
internet
and
a
word
processor.
Refining
my
research
writing
skills
continued
through
middle
school
and
into
high
school.
I
expanded
the
forms
of
writing
I
did
in
middle
school
when
we
started
writing
book
reports
and
poetry.
My
teachers
were
quite
creative
in
the
different
forms
we
were
required
to
try.
This
was
the
beginning
of
my
dislike
for
writing
poetry.
I
struggled
with
the
different
forms
of
poetry
and
finding
the
right
words
to
fit
the
format.
To
this
day,
I
will
choose
any
other
form
of
writing
over
poetry.
Freshmen
year
in
high
school
was
the
beginning
of
timed
essay
writing.
My
teachers
did
this
in
order
to
get
us
to
focus
on
what
was
important
in
our
essays
and
to
minimize
the
amount
of
irrelevant
material
we
spent
time
writing.
I
have
always
had
plenty
to
write.
I
struggled
to
focus
my
time
and
organize
my
essays
so
I
would
include
the
important
facts
that
I
needed
to
incorporate
to
support
my
thesis.
I
would
often
write
drafts
of
possible
essays
before
we
had
to
write
them
in
class.
This
way
I
had
already
thought
about
the
essay
and
knew
what
was
most
important
to
include.
I
was
fortunate
to
have
excellent
English
teachers
in
high
school.
We
spent
time
reading
and
interpreting
novels,
plays
and
poetry.
We
would
then
write
essays,
plays
and
poetry
of
our
own.
My
teachers
were
caring
and
attentive
teachers
and
were
always
available
for
help
and
to
offer
suggestions
on
my
work.
My
English
teachers
carefully
read
my
work
and
made
thorough
comments
before
assigning
a
grade.
I
grew
and
improved
as
a
writer
from
their
guidance.
During
my
sophomore
year,
my
teacher
would
assign
us
to
groups
where
we
would
read
one
anotherOs
drafts
and
make
comments.
This
was
my
first
experience
with
peer
reviews
in
class.
Our
grades
were
not
only
based
on
the
papers
we
wrote,
but
on
the
comments
we
provided
during
our
peer
reviews.
I
continued
to
do
peer
reviews
in
my
classes
throughout
high
school
and
into
college.
My
worst
writing
experiences
occurred
in
high
school.
The
first
occurred
in
my
junior
year
when
we
were
assigned
a
book
review
instead
of
a
book
report.
Our
teacher
provided
us
with
a
format
and
a
due
date.
When
I
got
my
review
back,
I
was
surprised
at
the
grade.
It
was
the
worst
grade
I
had
ever
received
on
a
written
assignment.
My
teacher
did
not
offer
many
comments
when
he
handed
it
back
and
did
not
offer
many
suggestions
when
I
first
approached
him.
I
knew
that
I
would
have
to
write
more
book
reviews
throughout
the
semester,
so
I
approached
him
again
in
order
to
get
suggestions
on
how
to
improve
on
future
book
reviews.
He
saw
that
I
was
determined
to
improve
and
let
me
write
an
extra
book
review
in
order
to
receive
a
better
grade.
The
second
worst
writing
experience
occurred
when
I
was
assigned
a
summer
book
report
that
was
due
on
the
first
day
of
school
of
my
senior
year.
The
teacher
who
had
taught
freshmen
and
senior
honors
English
was
diagnosed
with
ALS
and
was
unable
to
continue
teaching
during
my
junior
year.
His
position
was
filled
with
a
teacher
who
had
never
taught
high
school
English,
let
alone
AP
English.
The
summer
reading
and
writing
assignment
was
created
by
the
former
teacher,
but
the
new
teacher
was
to
read
and
then
grade
our
writing
assignments.
I
felt
that
I
had
a
well
written
paper
when
I
went
to
school,
but
when
I
received
the
grade
I
was
very
disappointed.
I
went
to
talk
to
the
new
teacher
and
he
was
confused
at
why
I
was
disappointed
in
my
grade
since
it
was
only
the
first
assignment.
He
did
not
know
that
I
was
a
perfectionist
and
that
this
was
not
an
example
of
my
usual
work
level.
We
discussed
ways
I
could
improve
my
writing
and
the
level
he
was
expecting
my
work
to
be
at.
When
I
started
college,
I
was
quite
intimidated
by
my
fellow
classmates.
Knowing
where
they
went
to
high
school
and
their
scores
on
AP
exams
or
SATs,
made
me
feel
inadequately
prepared.
I
did
not
feel
that
I
would
be
at
the
same
level
of
writing
as
my
peers.
My
FYS
professor
had
a
policy
that
we
could
rewrite
our
papers
as
many
times
as
we
wanted
to
in
order
to
get
our
desired
grade.
I
wanted
to
have
a
good
start
to
my
college
career
and
wanted
to
do
well
on
my
FYS
papers.
I
spent
an
enormous
amount
of
time
writing
my
first
paper
and
meeting
with
my
WA.
I
ended
up
failing
my
first
paper
along
with
the
rest
of
the
class.
Our
professor
was
an
extremely
hard
grader
and
wanted
to
make
us
work
for
our
grade.
After
finding
out
that
I
was
at
the
same
level
of
writing
as
the
rest
of
the
class,
I
felt
confident
that
I
could
be
successful
given
the
opportunity
and
guidance
to
write
at
the
college
level.
I
continued
to
improve
and
eventually
do
well
on
my
writing
assignments
in
FYS.
I
also
was
taking
biology
and
psychology,
which
required
me
to
write
laboratory
reports.
I
did
not
have
much
experience
writing
formal
lab
reports
in
high
school,
nor
had
I
ever
had
experience
writing
in
APA
style.
My
psychology
professor
actually
asked
me
to
meet
with
her
and
complimented
me
on
my
work.
She
told
me
that
my
writing
was
advanced
and
that
I
should
consider
doing
research
with
a
professor.
This
was
a
huge
compliment
for
someone
who
was
worried
about
their
writing
ability
and
meeting
the
expectations
of
college
professors.
My
best
writing
experience
occurred
during
my
freshmen
year.
I
was
taking
a
government
and
law
class
where
we
were
required
to
write
a
twenty
page
paper.
This
was
the
longest
paper
I
had
ever
had
to
write.
I
was
intimidated
by
my
professor
and
I
had
not
done
as
well
as
I
had
hoped
during
the
semester.
I
spent
a
substantial
amount
of
time
writing
this
paper
and
was
very
pleased
with
the
outcome.
I
knew
I
had
worked
hard
and
felt
rewarded
with
the
grade.
My
writing
career
in
college
thus
far
has
been
successful
due
to
the
support
of
my
professors,
peers
and
writing
programs.
Peer
reviews
have
been
helpful
when
either
performed
in
class
or
on
my
own
time.
My
parents
have
also
been
willing
to
read
my
papers
and
provide
their
suggestions.
Overall,
my
experiences
as
a
student
have
helped
to
shape
me
into
the
writer
I
am
today.
Although
creative
writing
has
been
pushed
aside
for
lab
reports
and
research
papers,
I
have
had
many
great
writing
experiences.
Through
my
experiences,
I
have
discovered
that
writing
has
been
the
most
useful
way
I
am
able
to
express
myself.
