Writing
as
a
WA:
Round
Three
GrammarEwhat
to
do
with
it?
When
I
first
became
a
WA,
I
probably
had
the
most
common
reason
for
wanting
to
become
a
WA:
I
liked
reading
other
peopleOs
papers
D
and
I
always
helped
my
roommate
with
her
paper!
I
guess
I
thought
I
was
unique,
but
after
participating
in
a
few
rounds
of
interviews
with
perspective
WAs,
I
am
convinced
that
I
was
just
as
clich
as
the
next
pat
answer.
But
nonetheless,
I
did
actually
enjoy
reading
my
roommateOs
papers,
and
I
still
do.
However,
I
initially
thought
being
a
WA
would
be
little
more
than
what
I
already
did
for
my
roommate.
Over
the
last
two
years,
I
have
realized
the
error
of
my
thinking
D
WAs
are
not
editors;
they
are
informed
readers.
Coming
to
this
realization
and
understanding
the
thinking
behind
the
role
of
a
WA
has
helped
me
immensely
in
my
own
writing
and
my
future
plans
for
teaching
English.
In
the
process
of
more
fully
understanding
the
role
of
a
WA,
I
have
learned
that
I
had
some
confusion
about
the
relationship
between
grammar
and
content.
While
I
understood
that
content
was
somewhat
more
important
that
grammar,
I
had
a
lot
of
difficulty
separating
the
two.
My
argument
was
that
the
content
is
more
important
than
grammar
since
it
is
the
message
of
the
paper;
but
the
grammar
is
also
inextricably
connected
to
the
context,
almost
as
a
matter
of
default,
since
it
is
the
medium
for
successfully
conveying
the
message
of
the
paper.
You
can
have
great
content,
but
without
successfully
utilizing
the
rules
of
grammar,
your
content
might
be
lost
in
the
jumble.
While
this
view
may
hold
some
water,
I
found
myself
unsure
about
my
ability
to
view
grammar
issues
as
lower
order
concerns
and
only
focus
on
the
higher
order
concerns.
It
seemed
impossible
to
me
to
read
a
paper
ridden
with
what
I
considered
to
be
grammatical
errors
and
simply
gloss
over
them.
I
was
convinced
I
wouldnOt
be
able
to
do
this
task.
But
I
guess
I
was
wrong!
Though
I
did
focus
too
much
on
lower
order
concerns
in
some
of
my
earliest
WA
conferences,
through
staff
meetings
and
training
conferences
and
after
gaining
more
experience
with
student
writers,
I
have
slowly
learned
to
look
at
writing
differently
D
seeing
content
as
something
that
can
indeed
be
separated
from
grammar.
The
last
year
is
evidence
that
I
have
learned
to
separate
content
and
grammar,
and
then
also
how
to
re-incorporate
them
in
an
effective
way
to
help
the
writer.
I
still
donOt
have
it
entirely
figured
out,
and
now
I
have
a
lot
of
new
questions
about
the
topic,
but
this
past
year
has
given
me
a
world
of
opportunity
to
grow
in
this
area
and
to
figure
out
what
I
believe
about
the
relationship
between
content
and
grammar
as
a
writer.
To
understand
the
different
influences
on
my
evolving
opinions,
I
will
focus
on
three
of
my
different
writing
situations
over
the
past
year:
a
class
on
the
English
Language,
my
pre-student
teaching
experiences
during
the
spring,
and
finally
my
summer
school
teaching
experience.
This
year
I
took
my
first
300
level
English
class
that
was
not
primarily
a
literature
class
D
The
English
Language.
Instead
of
ten
novels
and
poem
anthologies,
we
had
a
text
book
D
a
first
for
me
in
any
of
my
other
English
classes!
I
really
consider
this
class
to
be
one
of
the
cornerstone
classes
of
my
English
education
at
Lafayette.
Most
of
my
other
English
classes
have
been
on
literature,
which
I
love.
I
wouldnOt
change
the
fact
that
IOve
taken
so
many
literature
classes
at
Lafayette.
They
have
all
been
great,
teaching
me
about
genres,
analysis,
and
comprehension
and
giving
me
a
unique
perspective
about
an
array
of
time
periods
and
literary
styles.
However,
I
do
think
an
English
degree
focusing
only
on
literature
is
lacking
something
invaluable
D
the
study
of
the
actual
language.
I
consider
this
English
Language
class
to
be
like
the
Organic
Chemistry
of
English.
Not
that
I
need
validation
in
my
choice
of
degree,
but
when
all
of
my
friends
are
either
engineers
or
science
majors,
it
sometimes
starts
to
feel
like
much
of
what
IOm
doing
with
my
choice
of
major
isnOt
as
important
or
challenging
or
valuable.
I
donOt
agree
with
this
sentiment,
but
this
class
gave
me
concrete
evidence
that
there
is
more
to
English
than
reading
and
writing.
The
class
began
with
an
intense
study
of
English
grammar.
While
it
was
a
lot
of
work
and
grammar
exercises,
I
loved
every
minute
of
it.
I
love
grammar,
and
it
was
great
to
relearn
all
the
little
rules
I
had
forgotten,
and
learn
new
rules
that
made
writing
make
so
much
more
sense.
For
example,
I
never
understood
why
you
put
a
comma
in
front
of
NwhichO
but
not
in
front
of
Nthat.O
But
now
I
know
that
clauses
beginning
with
NthatO
are
restrictive
clauses
and
are
imperative
to
the
understand
of
the
sentence,
while
clauses
beginning
with
NwhichO
are
non-restrictive
class
and
basically
give
the
reader
extra
Nby-the-wayO
information.
Now
that
I
understanding
the
reasoning
behind
the
grammar
rule,
I
can
choice
more
wisely
when
to
use
NthatO
and
NwhichO
in
my
own
writing,
and
I
can
better
explain
the
rule
to
others.
After
this
rigorous
crash
course
in
standard
English
grammar,
we
studied
the
history
of
the
English
language
and
how
it
is
used
by
different
groups
of
people.
Even
though
we
first
focused
intensely
on
standard
grammar,
we
then
learned
that
grammar
is
much
more
than
the
standard.
We
learned
that
grammar
is
basically
any
set
of
rules
that
governs
the
way
a
language
works.
Therefore,
any
language
pattern
that
follows
rules
is
grammatical.
The
concept
was
very
foreign
to
me,
and
the
fact
that
I
thought
standard
English
was
the
only
grammatically
correct
form
of
English
shows
an
ignorance
and
ethnocentrism
on
my
part.
Once
we
established
that
correct
grammar
can
extend
to
many
different
forms
of
the
English
language,
we
learned
about
code
switching
D
using
a
language
style
or
grammar
appropriate
to
a
current
situation
or
audience.
The
concept
of
code
switching
seems
to
be
the
key
to
many
or
the
questions
I
have
about
the
relationship
between
content
and
grammar.
Regardless
of
the
situation,
content
remains
of
the
utmost
importance,
but
the
ability
to
code
switch
provides
the
writer
with
the
skills
to
recognize
how
important
the
mechanics
are
as
well.
Before,
during,
and
even
after
this
class,
I
have
struggled
with
the
role
grammar
should
play
in
my
teaching.
The
Easton
School
District
pools
from
a
very
diverse
population,
ethnically,
linguistically,
socially,
economically,
etc.
I
had
the
privilege
of
working
with
a
class
of
Non-levelO
8th
graders
at
Shawnee
Middle
School
during
the
January
Interim
Session
and
the
Spring
semester.
While
the
category
Non-levelO
might
suggest
a
group
of
students
who
are
ranked
at
the
appropriate
academic
level
or
at
least
at
the
average
academic
level
for
their
age
bracket,
these
students
are
actually
far
below
average
and
happen
to
reflect
more
than
their
share
of
the
cityOs
diversity.
During
my
time
with
these
8th
graders,
they
did
a
grammar
unit
on
irregular
verbs
and
subject
verb
agreement.
Several
of
the
students,
particularly
the
African
American
and
Hispanic
students,
had
a
lot
of
trouble
learning
the
forms
of
certain
irregular
verbs.
For
example,
the
past
tense
and
past
participle
of
NbringO
is
Nbrought.O
However,
students
constantly
choose
to
say
NbrangO
or
Nbrung.O
They
explained
that
it
made
sense
to
them,
and
they
understood
what
it
meant
to
have,
for
instance,
Nbrang
your
book
to
class.O
Clearly
these
students
better
understand
a
form
of
English
other
than
the
standard.
What
implications
does
this
scenario
have
for
me
as
both
an
educated
reader
of
my
peerOs
papers
and
as
a
future
educator
of
the
English
Language?
Should
I
legitimize
these
different
forms
of
Nto
bring?O
Or
should
I
teach
students
the
different
settings
in
which
it
is
appropriate
to
use
the
standard
and
non-standard
forms?
In
this
educational
experience,
the
teacher
explained
to
the
students
that
they
can
speak
however
they
choose,
but
on
the
test
they
will
need
to
know
the
NproperO
irregular
formations.
Even
with
this
disclaimer,
these
students
claimed
that
they
didnOt
care
and
would
continue
to
speak
the
way
that
made
sense
to
them,
asking,
NwhatOs
wrong
with
it
if
we
understand
it?O
Perhaps
the
teacher
could
have
chosen
a
less
stigmatizing
descriptive
word
of
the
standard
formations
than
Nproper,O
but
she
was
making
an
attempt
to
explain
the
different
settings
in
which
students
should
be
conscious
of
code
switching
between.
The
most
significant
thing
I
observed
from
this
entire
situation
is
that
the
students
were
clearly
able
to
separate
content
from
grammar.
They
still
understood
the
message
of
the
statement,
even
though
the
language
used
did
not
follow
the
rules
of
standard
English.
Clearly
the
message
is
the
most
important
part.
However,
while
the
students
were
able
to
successfully
separate
content
and
grammar,
which
was
originally
very
difficult
for
me,
they
were
unable
to
see
the
importance
of
using
different
speech
styles
in
different
situations
D
code
switching.
Though
it
seems
obvious,
it
is
now
much
clearer
to
me
that
my
first
goal
as
a
WA
or
English
teacher
should
be
to
help
the
writer
uncover
what
he
or
she
is
trying
to
say.
Often
one
of
the
first
questions
I
ask
at
a
WA
conference
is
what
the
writer
is
trying
to
say
in
his
or
her
paper.
Then
when
we
come
to
confusing
or
non-specific
areas
of
the
paper,
I
ask
the
same
question,
but
this
time
referring
to
a
very
narrow
subject.
I
donOt
ask
the
writer
to
speak
with
proper
subject
verb
agreement
or
with
parallel
structure,
simply
to
explain
the
ideas
in
his
or
her
own
words.
Similarly,
if
a
student
comes
to
me
as
a
teacher
saying,
NI
donOt
have
no
friends;
I
just
wanna
die,O
hopefully
it
would
be
common
sense
to
listen
to
and
encourage
the
student
with
his
or
her
problem
rather
than
fix
the
grammar
mistakes
of
the
studentOs
plea
for
help.
However,
once
the
message
or
content
is
being
fully
expressed,
then
it
is
appropriate
to
examine
the
audience
and
determine
which
rules
of
grammar
should
be
employed
for
the
clearest
expression
of
the
content.
In
the
same
WA
conference,
if
time
allowed
near
the
end,
I
would
likely
point
out
if
I
notice
the
writer
often
changed
back
and
forth
between
verb
tenses,
or
often
misplaced,
omitted,
or
overused
commas.
I
would
explain
that
usually
these
mistakes
do
not
detract
from
understanding
of
the
content,
but
sometimes
they
do.
And
furthermore,
the
professor
would
likely
have
certain
expectations
that
standard
formal
grammar
be
used
in
the
paper
at
hand.
Likewise,
if
the
same
troubled
student
came
to
be
another
time
asking
for
advice
about
communicating
with
a
teacher
who
was
treated
him
or
her
unfairly,
I
would
explain
that
the
teacher
might
receive
the
compliant
better
if
the
style
of
language
was
formal
and
standard.
After
taking
the
English
Language
class
and
then
witnessing
our
intellectual
class
discussions
about
grammar
and
code
switching
become
reality
when
teaching
in
the
8th
grade
classroom,
I
still
had
a
lot
of
questions
about
my
responsibility
as
a
current
WA
and
as
a
future
English
teacher.
Fortunately,
this
summer
I
was
given
the
golden
opportunity
to
have
my
own
classroom
of
students
in
which
I
could
experiment
with
my
ideas
and
learn
by
experience.
I
spent
8
weeks
working
in
Bethlehem
with
a
program
called
Summerbridge.
Summerbridge
is
a
enriched
summer
program
for
disadvantaged
middle
school
students
in
the
Lehigh
Valley.
This
summer
85
motivated
and
eager
students
from
diverse
ethnic
and
socioeconomic
backgrounds
volunteered
6
weeks
of
their
summer
to
improve
their
academic
standing
in
their
individual
schools
and
to
increase
their
chances
of
attending
college
in
the
future.
I
was
one
of
twenty
other
college
students
to
teach
these
students
one
of
four
subjects:
Math,
Science,
Literature,
and
Writing.
Much
to
my
enjoyment,
I
was
selected
as
a
writing
teacher.
This
was
my
first
opportunity
to
practice
what
I
had
recently
learned
and
grappled
with
in
my
English
language
class.
The
goal
of
the
6
week
program
was
for
each
of
the
students
to
write
a
five
paragraph
essay.
Along
the
way,
I
was
required
to
teach
many
writing
components
including
several
grammar
lessons,
topic
sentences,
supporting
sentences,
paragraph
unity,
transitions,
sensory
and
descriptive
writing,
creative
writing,
etc.
Additionally,
I
was
supposed
to
find
ways
to
make
all
of
this
material
fun,
hands
on,
and
above
all
student
centered.
At
times
it
was
very
challenging
to
do
so,
but
by
the
second
half
of
the
summer,
the
students
were
even
enjoying
the
grammar
lesson!
In
fact,
I
think
the
activity
they
liked
the
best
was
the
grammar
relay
race
we
played
to
review
for
a
big
grammar
test.
While
we
certainly
did
cover
differ
grammar
topics
such
as
subject
and
predicates,
fragments
and
run-ons,
subject-verb
agreement,
punctuation,
and
capitalization,
I
also
worked
very
hard
on
separating
grammar
from
content.
For
example,
the
students
usually
journaled
in
class
on
various
topics
two
or
three
times
a
week.
I
told
hem
from
the
beginning
that
I
would
not
be
grading
the
journals,
only
commenting
on
them.
I
also
made
it
clear
that
I
would
only
be
reading
for
content,
not
grammar,
unless
part
of
the
journal
assignment
was
to
practice
something
we
had
recently
learned
in
class.
Though
I
had
once
thought
I
would
not
be
able
to
read
a
piece
of
writing
without
immediately
fixing
grammar
mistakes,
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
my
ability
to
simply
focus
on
what
each
student
was
saying.
I
found
that
my
attitude
completely
changed
about
the
grammar
being
so
important
and
I
truly
enjoyed
reading
the
students
ideas
without
worrying
about
exactly
how
they
said
them.
Also,
as
the
summer
went
on
and
we
learned
more
about
characteristics
of
successful
writing,
the
writing
clearly
improved,
even
in
the
journals
where
they
knew
they
didnOt
need
to
worry
about
style.
A
big
way
that
I
tried
to
reinforce
the
difference
in
importance
between
content
and
grammar
was
in
the
writing
process.
We
used
a
five
step
writing
process:
prewriting,
drafting,
revising,
editing,
and
publishing.
The
third
and
forth
steps
were
easily
confused
by
the
students,
but
I
tried
to
reiterate
that
revision
was
improving
content
and
editing
was
fixing
grammar
D
and
revising
ALWAYS
comes
before
editing.
The
students
finally
seemed
to
understand
as
represented
by
part
of
a
poem
they
wrote
for
an
end
of
the
year
skit
:
The
next
two
steps
can
be
confused:
When
we
forget
them,
is
not
amused.
With
revising,
your
content
is
improved;
When
you
edit,
all
your
mistakes
are
removed!
Though
I
did
not
require
the
students
to
write
in
perfect
standard
grammar
in
their
journals,
I
did
try
to
teach
them
about
code
switching
and
how
their
writing
should
reflect
the
audience
that
they
are
writing
for.
Their
journals
were
not
formal
pieces
of
writing,
but
their
five-paragraphs
essays
were.
Since
it
was
so
important
for
the
five-paragraph
essays
to
reflect
all
the
standard
grammar
and
other
wiring
components
leaned
in
class,
we
spent
the
better
part
of
a
week
in
class
on
revising
and
editing
of
their
five-paragraph
essays.
First
the
students
did
self
evaluations,
then
peer
conferencing,
and
finally,
I
met
with
them
briefly
to
make
sure
they
were
on
track.
It
took
a
lot
of
work,
and
virtually
the
whole
summer,
but
I
could
not
have
bee
more
pleased
with
how
they
essays
turned
out,
and
how
much
each
students
truly
improved
as
a
writer.
I
really
think
they
let
class
with
a
better
understanding
of
the
relationship
between
content
and
grammar,
the
skills
necessary
to
use
standard
grammar,
and
the
ability
to
code
switch
depending
on
the
situation.
It
is
my
goal
to
continue
in
this
pattern
in
my
own
writing,
in
my
WA
conferences,
and
in
all
of
my
teaching
of
writing
in
the
future.
