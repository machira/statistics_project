Dynamic
Writers
Over
the
summer,
I
had
the
experience
of
working
for
a
large,
Fortune
100
company.
With
a
large
company
comes
corporate
life.
Corporate
life
for
me
included
developing
and
polishing
some
specific
skills:
public
speaking,
persuasion
ability,
analytical
skills,
and
business
writing,
just
to
name
a
few.
All
of
these
skills
balance
to
make
a
promising
businessperson.
As
I
thought
about
the
different
challenges
that
I
would
face,
I
knew
that
writing
would
be
a
strength,
a
crutch
that
would
help
make
a
successful
summer.
After
taking
a
few
writing
classes
and
being
a
writing
associate
for
4
semesters,
I
was
fairly
confident
that
I
would
be
a
decent
writer.
Boy
did
I
get
a
slap
in
the
face!
One
day
this
past
summer,
I
had
just
finished
some
analysis
that
I
had
been
working
on
for
quite
some
time
when
my
manager
came
to
me
and
asked
for
a
1
to
2
page
memo
describing
what
I
did
and
what
the
results
were.
He
went
on
further
to
say
that
this
memo
would
be
given
to
a
senior
vice-president
and
all
of
his
direct
reports.
Eagerly,
I
started
my
memo.
I
thought
that
this
memo
was
the
perfect
opportunity
to
show
the
senior
management
that
I
was
a
decent
writer.
As
I
worked
on
it,
I
meticulously
placed
every
word.
I
revised
the
memo
numerous
times,
just
to
be
sure
that
it
flowed
smoothly
and
got
my
point
across.
After
about
a
day's
worth
of
revision,
I
gave
it
to
my
boss
to
look
over
before
I
passed
it
along.
Needless
to
say,
a
half
an
hour
later,
my
boss
said
that
he
wanted
to
sit
down
and
talk
with
me
about
the
memo.
He
seemed
fairly
pleased.
I
thought
that
he
would
make
some
small
suggestions,
and
the
memo
would
be
on
it's
way
to
the
big
wigs.
Well,
when
we
sat
down
and
started
to
go
over
it,
my
boss
just
about
walked
up
one
side
of
my
face
and
down
the
other.
Although
grammatically
correct,
the
style
that
I
used
was
inappropriate.
As
I
found
out,
in
business
you
never
use
"fluff;"
you
never
use
words
that
involve
feelings
or
hunches;
you
only
present
the
facts.
I
learned
that
lesson
the
hard
way,
but
my
manager
was
fairly
understanding.
He
worked
with
me
to
improve
my
business
writing.
We
went
though
about
12
drafts
of
the
V/*
page
memo
before
it
was
acceptable.
I
never
thought
that
I
would
ever
spend
that
much
time
on
such
a
short
piece
of
writing,
but
by
the
time
I
had
completed
it,
I
had
learned
a
great
deal
about
business
writing
and
businesses
in
general.
In
fact,
the
memos
that
I
wrote
later
in
the
summer,
were
finished
in
only
a
few
drafts.
I
had
learned
a
completely
new
style
of
writing--a
skill
that
I
will
need
throughout
my
career.
It
is
an
investment
in
myself,
and
being
a
writing
associate
greatly
helped
in
this
investment.
Just
as
my
story
illustrates,
the
College
Writing
Program
demands
that
the
writing
associates
have
the
ability
to
recognize
a
new
style
of
writing
and
adapt.
It
does
so
by
assigning
WAs
to
classes
that
are
outside
of
that
WA's
major
or
expertise.
Throughout
an
academic
career,
it's
easy
to
get
caught
in
a
rut
of
writing
(and
thinking,
for
that
matter).
Being
WAs,
we
are
afforded
the
opportunity
to
go
outside
our
comfort
zone
and
explore
other
styles
of
writing.
My
FYS,
FYW
and
VaST
courses
all
explored
rhetorical
writing
and
the
use
of
metaphors.
We
looked
at
many
different
places
where
rhetoric
is
used:
advertising,
politics,
preaching,
science
writing,
etc.
Although
these
classes
were
excellent
and
showed
me
many
different
aspects
of
writing,
I
was
never
forced
to
write
something
outside
of
what
I
was
used
to,
literary
writing.
For
these
3
courses
I
had
two
different
professors,
and
they
were
both
in
the
English
department.
Although
these
courses
clearly
demonstrated
to
me
how
the
audience
drives
the
rhetoric
and
structure
of
a
paper,
they
didn't
give
me
much
exposure
to
clearly
different
styles
of
writing.
And
in
defense
of
these
courses,
I
wouldn't
expect
to
have
experienced
truly
different
styles
of
writing--the
semester
is
only
14
weeks
long.
As
I
progress
through
my
mathematics
major,
I
am
required
to
write
mathematical
papers.
This
aspect
of
writing
became
very
obvious
to
me
over
the
last
year.
The
first
professor
that
required
a
truly
mathematical
paper
from
me
had
very
high
expectations--I
was
his
WA
for
a
VaST
course
that
he
had
taught
the
previous
semester.
Mathematical
writing
was
very
different
from
any
other
writing
style
that
I
had
experienced.
The
purpose
and
agenda
of
the
paper
was
very
structured,
and
that
structure
was
laid
out
for
the
reader.
Writing
this
paper
was
very
difficult,
but
taught
me
a
great
deal
about
a
different
audience
and
how
their
expectations
drove
how
I
could
best
covey
my
thoughts
to
them.
The
experiences
that
I
have
had
working
for
the
College
Writing
Program
help
me
to
experience
first-hand
other
types
of
writing.
My
first
assignment,
required
that
I
develop
the
creative
and
analytical
side
to
my
writing.
I
was
assigned
to
an
FYS
that
read
Rent,
and
other
very
expressive
works.
The
writers
in
this
course
had
to
analyze
the
characters,
their
significance,
and
how
the
work
engaged
the
audience
by
pulling
at
similarities
between
the
characters
and
the
audience.
Although
I
wasn't
technically
writing--I
wasn't
writing
anything
on
paper--I
still
went
through
the
writing
process
with
each
person
in
that
class.
By
going
through
the
writing
process,
I
learned
about
the
more
sensitive
side
to
writing.
I
learned
about
another
way
to
express
yourself
through
writing.
I
learned
yet
another
style
of
writing.
The
last
two
assignments
that
I
have
had
as
a
WA
exposed
me
to
another
realm
of
writing.
The
professors
for
these
courses
were
a
chemical
engineer
and
a
physics
professor.
Consequently,
the
writing
had
a
strong
technical
flavor.
The
papers
for
the
engineering
professor
had
to
be
visually
pleasing
and
very
functional,
while
the
papers
for
the
physics
professor
had
to
be
rich
with
examples
and
clear
arguments.
The
papers
presented
arguments
in
a
step-by-step
fashion.
They
had
to
be
very
clear
and
concise.
As
a
WA,
I
had
to
spend
some
considerable
time
with
these
professors
to
understand
their
style
of
writing.
I
learned
two
more
styles
of
writing,
and
was
exposed
to
two
different
audience
and
the
expectations
that
they
bring.
The
many
different
aspects
of
writing
that
I
have
gained
throughout
the
experiences
that
I
have
just
shared
helped
me
understand
and
become
efficient
with
business
writing.
When
I
was
introduced
to
business
writing,
I
began
to
look
for
similarities
in
other
styles
of
writing
that
I
have
seen.
I
looked
at
things
like
the
use
of
"I",
appropriate
adjectives,
the
use
of
examples
and
details,
and
overall
format.
I
used
my
experiences
in
other
writing
styles
to
help
understand
the
new
style.
Over
the
summer
I
realized
how
important
it
is,
not
only
to
our
own
writing,
but
also
to
the
Writing
Program,
that
we
explore
different
styles
of
writing,
and
that
we
draw
on
these
experiences
to
help
us
become
better
writers.
Being
a
WA
demands
that
we
have
the
flexibility
to
move
fairly
easily
between
writing
styles.
We
must
be
able
to
carry
the
skill
sets
that
we
have
acquired
from
one
style
of
writing
to
the
next,
across
disciplines.
The
constant
rotation
that
a
WA
goes
through
(by
rotation
I
mean
being
assigned
to
different
types
of
classes)
ensures
that
a
WA
will
become
a
well-rounded
writer.
It
forces
the
WA
to
think
about
the
audience
for
the
papers,
and
therefore
determines
the
style
of
the
paper.
It
is
exactly
the
audience
and
their
expectations
that
must
be
crystal-clear
before
the
paper
is
written,
and
certainly
before
the
WA
can
play
an
active
role.
Knowing
the
audience
and
their
expectations
is
probably
the
piece
of
advice
that
I
give
most
frequently
to
writers.
Once
the
audience
is
known,
the
style,
content,
everything
is
common
sense.
Over
the
summer,
I
often
asked
myself
the
question
"What
does
this
person
really
want
to
know?"
The
Sr.
vice-president
isn't
going
to
want
the
gory
details
of
my
analysis.
He
will
want
the
overall
business-impact
of
my
findings.
As
for
the
analyst
that
is
reviewing
my
work,
he/she
will
want
every
trend,
every
figure,
every
little
detail
of
what
I
did.
It
sounds
like
common
sense,
right?
Just
as
important,
if
not
more
important
than
the
content
of
the
memo,
was
the
style.
Bullets
or
no
bullets?
Paragraphs
or
fragments?
Everything
is
driven
by
the
audience.
As
we
experience
different
styles
of
writing,
the
characteristics
of
that
become
more
apparent.
With
these
characteristics,
similarities
are
then
clearly
seen
between
the
different
styles
of
writing,
because
similarities
exist
in
their
audiences.
This
ability
to
recognize
similarities
in
writing
styles
allows
a
writer
to
quickly
learn
new
styles.
Therefore,
being
a
WA
and
being
exposed
to
different
writing
styles
clearly
gives
us
the
advantage.
I
attribute
the
success
that
I
had
this
summer
to
the
skill
set
that
I
had
in
my
toolbox;
I
only
had
to
apply
what
I
already
knew
in
a
different
way.
Looking
back
at
my
writing
career
here
at
Lafayette,
I'm
not
sure
that
I
would
have
understood
the
many
different
types
of
writing
that
exist,
had
I
not
been
a
writing
associate.
Being
a
writing
associate
has
strengthened
me
as
a
writer,
as
a
critic
of
others'
writing,
and
as
a
recipient
of
criticism.
But
most
importantly,
I've
learned
that
I
can
generalize
my
skill-sets
to
new
situations.
As
a
WA,
I
am
confident
that
I
can
go
into
a
class
that
is
outside
of
my
major
and
help
the
writers
improve
their
writing.
I
am
confident
that
I
can
offer
useful
suggestions
and
criticism.
I
can
do
this,
because
I
have
learned
to
look
to
an
assignment
and
say
"What
does
this
person
really
want?"
Style,
content,
grammar,
formality,
everything
falls
into
place
once
this
question
is
answered.
Nothing
made
me
realize
this
more
than
the
experience
that
I
had
this
summer,
and
how
prepared
I
was
because
of
what
I
learned
as
a
WA.
And
so
I
encourage
writing
associates,
and
the
Program,
to
take
on
classes
that
break
the
norm
and
go
out
of
the
comfort
zone
of
a
particular
writing
style.
Choose
classes
that
force
an
understanding
of
many
different
writing
styles--as
I
have
seen,
there
is
much
to
benefit.
