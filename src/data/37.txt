My
History
as
A
Writer
The
process
of
becoming
a
good
writer
was
a
long
and
difficult
process-
it
took
years
of
learning
and
lots
of
practice.
Through
creative
experiences
on
my
own
and
lots
of
positive
guidance
from
others,
I
slowly
traversed
the
path
to
becoming
a
knowledgable
writer.
Now
that
I
am
a
writing
associate,
I
can
see
some
of
the
stages
that
I
went
through
as
a
writer
in
others.
Although
I
can't
remember
my
very
first
writing
experience,
my
mother
told
me
that
I
used
to
write
things
down,
mostly
nonsense,
when
I
was
very
young.
My
first
real
memories
of
writing,
however,
were
all
very
good.
Writing
creatively
is
all
that
I
can
ever
remember
being
asked
to
do
as
a
child,
and
being
able
to
let
my
imagination
fly
by
creating
my
own
stories
made
the
process
a
lot
of
fun.
One
of
the
best
motivations
for
me
to
write
at
this
stage
was
being
able
to
share
my
stories
with
others-
whether
it
be
my
parents
or
my
peers.
When
reading
my
work
to
others
and
hearing
others
do
the
same,
I
began
to
understand
the
importance
of
the
way
words
sounded
together.
Moreover,
by
reading
my
papers
aloud,
my
ability
to
punctuate
was
much
facilitated.
My
teachers
would
always
tell
me
that
I
would
be
able
to
hear
where
I
needed
to
punctuate.
The
next
step
beyond
just
being
able
to
put
ideas
down
on
paper
was
learning
how
to
organize
my
thoughts.
This
proved
to
be
one
of
the
hardest
things
for
me
to
do.
I
don't
know
if
I
had
too
many
thoughts
flowing
through
my
head
all
of
the
time,
but
I
remember
feeling
as
if
I
had
so
much
to
write
down
that
I
couldn't
write
it
fast
enough.
Many
of
my
stories
had
very
good
points
and
contained
well
developed
paragraphs,
but
the
thoughts
were
all
jumbled
in
a
nonsensical
order.
It
wasn't
until
the
concept
of
outlining
was
taught
to
me
that
I
really
was
able
to
start
to
organize
my
thoughts
on
paper.
Having
to
create
thorough
outlines
before
beginning
the
actual
writing
process
was
the
way
that
I
had
to
begin
all
of
my
papers.
This
technique
and
others
to
organize
thoughts
became
vital
to
my
writing.
Organization
was
a
chore
for
me
still
in
the
revision
stages
at
this
point
because
it
was
not
easy
to
rearrange
ideas
for
me
since
I
was
writing
everything
out
by
hand.
Being
lazy
also
became
a
factor
in
resolving
problems
in
this
area,
however,
when
my
family
purchased
their
first
word
processor
revision
became
a
lot
easier.
As
I
got
into
my
middle
school
years,
writing
in
journals
became
a
pretty
regular
process.
Every
day
before
class
commenced,
all
of
the
students
would
have
to
write
atleast
a
page
in
their
journals.
I
never
really
understood
the
reason
for
this,
what
seemed
to
be,
monotonous
writing
ritual.
However
I
did
find
myself
being
able
to
write
freely
about
what
ever
was
on
my
mind-
it
got
my
creative
juices
flowing.
On
my
own
time,
I
also
began
to
keep
a
diary/journal
as
well,
writing
atleast
two
pages
in
it
every
day,
and
I
found
that
it
helped
me
maintain
the
skills
that
I
had
learned
in
school
over
the
summers
when
I
would
normally
become
rusty.
Being
able
to
write
for
my
own
enjoyment
not
only
gave
me
practice,
but
also
helped
me
develop
my
own
style.
In
middle
school,
I
also
did
a
lot
of
work
on
introductions
and
conclusions.
Different
teachers
taught
different
ways
to
go
about
these
very
important
parts
of
papers.
I
found,
though,
through
my
experience
as
a
writer,
that
the
way
a
person
develops
these
parts
of
a
paper
is
up
to
the
writer.
My
particular
ability
to
develop
the
introduction
and
conclusion
seemed
to
come
pretty
easily
with
the
rest
of
my
paper.
Style
was
probably
the
hardest
thing
to
develop,
and
I
was
not
even
aware
that
there
was
such
a
thing
until
high
school.
I
remember
feeling
as
if
my
skills
as
a
writer
still
needed
a
lot
of
work.
Freshman
year
I
had
a
professor
infamous
for
being
one
of
the
toughest
in
the
school,
and
our
first
assignment
of
the
year
was
a
research
paper.
Ahhh!
These
words
were
hitting
my
ears
for
the
first
time,
and
I
didn't
have
the
slightest
idea
how
to
go
about
this
project.
I
thought
that
I
could
just
go
to
an
encyclopedia
and
write
down
what
it
said
about
my
topic.
It
was
like
a
slap
in
the
face,
when
I
received
a
big
F
when
my
first
draft
was
returned
from
my
teacher.
This
was
the
first
time
I
remember
feeling
like
writing
was
not
as
much
fun
as
I
thought
it
could
be.
It
was
no
longer
what
I
thought
that
mattered,
but
if
I
followed
the
rules
that
delegated
my
grade.
Little
did
I
know
that
just
following
the
rules
was
only
part
of
a
larger
picture.
As
I
soon
found
out,
this
project
was
only
a
test
to
see
how
much
we
knew,
as
a
class,
about
writing
research
papers.
We
spent
the
rest
of
the
year
learning
how
to
write
one
correctly.
I
feel
that
learning
how
to
write
a
research
paper
was
my
first
real
preparation
for
college.
This
type
of
writing
only
continued
throughout
my
high
school
years,
but
it
was
my
junior
year
high
school
teacher
that
I
feel
had
the
biggest
impact
on
me
as
a
writer
now.
He
had
a
big
sign
in
his
room
that
said,
We
are
going
to
college!
No
matter
what
anybody
complained
about,
he
would
answer
with
that
motto.
It
gave
me
a
lot
of
confidence
in
him
and
a
goal
for
me
to
work
towards.
This
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
writing
truly
became
a
challenge
for
me.
The
diversity
of
writing
projects
that
he
assigned,
and
being
able
to
argue
your
paper,
addressing
different
audiences
and
many
other
important
factors
involved
in
writing
were
all
taught
thoroughly
in
his
class.
My
most
favorite
of
all
writing
projects
was
assigned
in
his
class.
It
was
a
research-type
paper
with
a
twist.
We
had
to
write
our
autobiographies.
It
was
great
because
he
wanted
us
to
find
out
about
ourselves
and
our
histories-
and
who
doesn't
love
to
write
about
themselves.
This
paper
incorporated
the
skills
needed
to
do
research
and
also
the
creative
side
of
telling
a
story
worth
reading.
It
was
after
doing
this
project
that
I
felt
that
my
skills
as
a
writer
had
matured.
When
I
first
entered
college,
I
wasn't
sure
how
my
skills
as
a
writer
would
compare
with
other
students.
I
was
naturally
a
little
nervous
to
receive
my
first
grade.
I
found
out
soon
enough
that
I
was
more
than
adequately
prepared.
I
was
surprised
to
find
that
a
lot
of
my
peers
did
not
even
know
how
to
write
a
research
paper.
There
were
also
other
little
things
such
as
sentence
structure
and
sentence
fragments
that
some
students
had
not
a
clue
about.
I
began
to
feel
a
little
more
confident
with
my
writing,
with
the
positive
reinforcement
of
my
professor.
My
freshman
year
I
was
exempt
from
English
110,
and
during
this
time
I
began
to
learn
a
whole
new
style
of
writing.
Because
I
am
a
science
major,
I
have
learned
to
write
according
to
the
guidelines
in
the
science
world.
Instead
of
taking
away
from
my
previous
experience
as
a
writer,
it
has
added
a
new
dimension
to
my
writing.
My
writing
has
undergone
some
changes,
such
as
becoming
much
more
concise
and
factual.
At
times
I
do
find
it
hard
to
expand
on
my
thoughts
and
tap
into
my
creative
side
because
I
have
become
intuned
to
scientific
writing,
but
it
only
serves
as
another
challenge
to
overcome.
The
process
of
becoming
a
knowledgable
writer
was
a
long
and
difficult
process.
Although
I
feel
that
my
writing
has
improved
over
the
years,
there
is
much
more
room
for
improvement
and
further
learning.
My
experience
as
a
Writing
Associate
has
helped
me
address
problems
in
my
own
writing
techniques
and
improve
them,
as
well
as
help
others
on
the
road
to
becoming
better
writers.
