Ites
difficult
to
write
a
paper
about
writing.
Ites
even
harder
to
explain
to
someone
how
you
learned
to
write,
or
why
you
like
it.
Perhaps
being
good
at
something
goes
hand
in
hand
with
liking
somethingbthe
better
you
are
at
it,
the
easier
it
becomes
and
the
more
you
like
doing
it.
Ieve
always
had
a
certain
aptitude
for
writingbin
third
grade
my
teacher
made
a
comment
on
a
short
story
I
had
written:
vYou
certainly
have
a
knack
for
writing!g
Ites
possible
that
her
encouragement
made
me
realize
that
I
actually
did
enjoy
writing.
English
papers
and
history
essays
never
seemed
to
be
daunting
tasksbthe
words
just
came
out
on
the
page
with
little
to
no
effort.
Although
I
have
been
praised
for
my
writing
abilities
throughout
my
education,
this
wasnet
always
the
case.
After
really
thinking
hard
about
my
first
experiences
in
writing,
I
found
myself
back
in
my
bedroomShch
I
jumped
at
the
sharp
sound
of
my
motheres
voice.
Her
tone
indicated
I
was
in
trouble,
but
why?
Looking
at
my
bedroom
walls,
I
discovered
the
reason
for
her
irritation:
clearly
written
across
the
span
of
my
room
were
my
first
and
last
names,
the
big,
bold
letters
matching
my
height
exactly.
My
mother,
in
her
a
fit
of
rage,
could
only
focus
on
the
fact
that
red
crayon
now
covered
the
freshly-painted
walls.
She
had
failed
to
notice
that
her
oldest
daughter
had
written
her
full
name
in
perfectly-formed
letters
without
any
assistance,
something
most
first-graders
can
not
accomplishbI
was
three
years
old.
2
I
remember
learning
to
read
at
the
age
of
fourbI
read
vSaturday
Is
Ballet
Dayg
with
my
father
one
night
before
bed.
We
sounded
out
the
words
together
until
I
could
read
it
cover
to
cover
all
by
myself.
By
kindergarten,
I
was
reading
chapter
books,
and
soon,
I
was
able
to
finish
three
or
four
books
in
a
week.
When
writing
assignments
were
handed
out
in
school,
I
modeled
my
writing
style
after
the
authors
whom
I
spent
so
many
hours
studying
and
admiring.
My
teachers
were
impressed
with
my
ability
to
string
a
complex
sentence
together
when
others
were
stuck
on
the
subject-predicate
format.
However
interested
I
was
in
completing
writing
assignments
for
school,
I
never
really
felt
the
urge
to
venture
into
the
creative
aspect
of
writing.
I
never
kept
a
journal
or
wrote
short
stories
for
mere
entertainment;
my
writing
consisted
of
only
those
assignments
required
for
school.
On
a
family
vacation
to
Florida,
we
took
a
trip
to
a
national
wildlife
refuge,
visiting
dozens
of
birds
in
their
natural
habitats.
Because
my
brother
and
I
were
missing
days
of
school,
my
first
grade
teacher
asked
that
I
keep
a
journal
of
my
trip.
I
wrote
in
it
every
day,
carefully
detailing
my
favorite
parts
of
our
adventures.
When
I
returned
with
my
journal
in
hand,
my
teacher
noticed
one
specific
entry:
I
had
spent
pages
writing
about
merganser
ducks,
a
species
commonly
found
in
southwest
Florida.
I
described
their
eating
habits
and
migrating
rituals,
along
with
their
colorings
and
any
other
details
I
could
get
down
on
paper.
My
teacher
took
note
of
the
topic
and
mentioned
it
to
my
mother,
who
wasnet
the
least
bit
surprised.
In
fourth
grade,
my
class
participated
in
a
program
called
vBridging
the
Generation
Gap,g
which
included
spending
time
with
senior
citizens
from
the
local
adult
3
community.
As
part
of
the
curriculum,
we
were
required
to
write
an
essay
for
a
contest
entitled
vGrowing
Up,
Growing
Older.g
I
left
the
essay
for
the
last
minute,
quickly
typing
a
few
paragraphs
on
our
old
family
computer.
The
assignment
was
to
describe
what
growing
older
meant
to
us:
the
first
idea
that
came
to
mind
was
to
write
about
my
grandpa.
The
smartest
man
I
know,
my
grandpa
is
what
I
called
vyoung
at
heart.g
I
wrote
out
about
our
relationship,
and
how
he
always
imparted
his
knowledge
upon
my
siblings
and
me.
I
handed
the
essay
in,
grateful
to
have
finished
the
assignment.
A
few
weeks
later,
I
was
invited
to
attend
a
town
council
meeting,
where
I
was
awarded
first
prize
in
the
essay
contest.
My
grandpa,
who
had
no
idea
I
had
written
about
him,
later
saw
my
essay
printed
in
the
newspaper.
He
called
me
that
night,
deeply
touched
that
I
had
written
something
about
him
that
was
straight
from
the
heart.
I
think
that
was
part
of
the
reason
why
I
wonbmy
essay
was
personal
and
special.
My
grandpa
still
has
a
copy
that
he
keeps
in
his
desk
drawer.
That
essay
was,
and
still
is
today,
one
of
my
favorite
pieces
I
have
ever
written.
After
being
praised
for
my
writing
throughout
the
seven
years
of
elementary
school,
middle
school
came
as
quite
a
shock.
Eighth
grade
came,
and
I
was
introduced
to
a
teacher
whose
sole
mission
was
to
avoid
handing
out
Aes;
she
required
specific
forms
of
writing
that
almost
no
one
could
master.
In
her
class,
I
came
in
contact
with
styles
of
writing
that
I
had
never
had
to
produce:
persuasive
essays,
argumentative
papers,
and
personal
narratives.
However,
this
teacher
was
hard
to
please,
and
I
never
received
so
much
criticism
for
my
writing
in
all
my
life.
After
writing
an
essay
about
George
Orwelles
Animal
Farm,
I
got
it
back
with
a
large,
bold
vSee
me!g
scrawled
across
the
top.
4
Obviously,
I
had
either
missed
the
point
of
the
book
or
the
assignmentbthe
teacher
insisted
it
was
both.
Three
versions
later,
I
was
given
a
final
grade
of
a
C+bmy
first
grade
lower
than
an
A
on
any
kind
of
written
assignment.
Determined
to
show
this
woman
I
was
no
idiot,
I
began
the
difficult
task
of
actually
trying
when
writing
papers
(a
new
concept
for
me).
I
survived
eighth
grade
Honors
English
with
an
A-
for
the
year.
As
stubborn
as
that
teacher
was,
there
is
one
assignment
that
sticks
out
in
my
mind.
We
were
given
the
task
of
writing
a
descriptive
essay,
using
metaphors,
similes,
and
as
many
descriptions
as
possible
to
describe
our
favorite
place.
This
was
something
I
could
handle.
I
easily
described
my
favorite
place
in
the
world:
my
grandparentse
beach
house
at
the
Jersey
shore.
After
receiving
a
well-deserved
A+
and
an
vExcellent
writing!g
across
the
top,
I
decided
to
frame
the
paper
and
give
it
to
my
grandparents
as
a
Christmas
gift.
I
framed
and
matted
the
essay,
included
a
picture
of
all
the
grandchildren
at
the
beach
with
our
grandparents,
and
waited
until
Christmas
morning.
Tears
of
joy
came
from
both
grandparentse
eyes
that
day,
and
I
never
felt
more
proud
of
my
writing
than
I
did
in
that
moment.
I
would
have
to
say
that
this
paper
is
another
one
of
my
favorites.
Throughout
high
school,
writing
was
never
an
issue.
I
easily
completed
research
papers
for
history
and
English
classes,
all
the
while
feeling
supremely
confident
that
Ied
written
an
excellent
essay.
Occasionally,
however,
I
would
convince
myself
that
this
was,
in
fact,
the
worst
paper
Ied
ever
written
and
would
surely
receive
nothing
better
than
a
C.
Nonetheless,
my
teachers
all
disagreed
and
continually
handed
me
Aes.
Every
year,
each
history
class
was
required
to
submit
a
single
research
paper
in
June,
as
a
culmination
5
of
the
yeares
studies.
Three
years
in
a
row,
my
history
teachers
requested
that
they
keep
a
copy
of
my
papers
to
use
as
examples
for
the
following
yeares
classbI
modestly
agreed.
In
spite
of
all
this
praise,
senior
English
was
a
little
more
difficult
than
I
expected.
I
encountered
a
teacher
who
also
taught
part-time
at
New
York
University,
and
expected
her
high
school
seniors
to
perform
at
the
same
level
as
the
journalism
majors
in
the
graduate
program
at
NYU.
This
did
not
seem
to
be
too
difficult,
seeing
as
this
was
Advanced
Placement
English
and
we
were
expected
to
produce
work
above
and
beyond
what
any
normal
high
school
senior
could
manage
(especially
those
suffering
from
the
effects
of
senior-itis).
It
was
in
this
class
that
I
first
discovered
free-writing,
where
we
were
required
to
respond
to
the
books
we
read
in
this
less-than-formal
essay
form.
I
found
it
difficult
to
free-write
in
any
intellectual
capacity,
because
I
simply
could
not
let
my
brain
go.
I
functioned
much
better
with
a
specific
set
of
instructions
and
a
plan
in
mind;
I
did
not
like
free-associating
ideas
and
then
having
them
judged
and
graded.
However,
I
somehow
managed
to
impress
my
teacher
with
associations
to
past
novels
Ied
read
that
had
similar
themes
or
ideas.
She
claimed
she
vliked
my
thinking.g
All
throughout
my
writing
career,
I
was
always
told
that
I
should
become
a
writer.
My
dad
constantly
tells
me
to
become
a
journalistbvwrite
a
column
for
The
Wall
Street
Journal
or
The
New
York
Times,g
he
says.
If
Iem
always
told
that
I
excel
at
something,
then
how
come
I
donet
enjoy
it
as
much
as
I
should?
Sure,
it
is
fairly
easy
to
sit
down
and
write
an
essay,
but
ites
not
my
first
choice
as
an
activity
in
my
spare
time.
College
professors
have
told
me
my
sentence
structure
is
superb,
and
that
my
use
of
vocabulary
and
varied
ideas
make
my
papers
more
sophisticated
than
most
English
majors
ever
6
write.
Of
course,
that
is
just
an
opinion
from
a
few
professorsbI
still
have
many
more
to
meet.
High
school,
for
me,
was
a
lot
of
work.
Between
four
or
five
Advanced
Placement
classes
a
year,
in
addition
to
any
other
honors
classes
that
were
offered,
I
had
to
keep
in
control
to
balance
the
heavy
workload.
My
teachers
were
constantly
talking
about
what
college
writing
would
be
like,
and
that
they
were
pushing
us
for
our
own
good.
They
insisted
college
would
be
more
difficult
and,
consequently,
continuously
gave
us
an
obscene
amount
of
essays
to
write
throughout
the
school
year.
Their
purpose
was
to
match,
and
prepare
us
for,
the
demanding
lifestyle
that
would
greet
us
upon
entering
college.
In
spite
of
this,
I
came
to
college
only
to
find
that
the
tasks
that
were
asked
of
me
seemed
simple
and
uncomplicated
compared
to
those
from
high
school.
I
was
expecting
to
be
slammed
with
coursework
and
thirty-page
research
papers,
and
instead,
I
found
the
essays
I
had
to
write
were
not
much
different,
if
not
easier,
than
those
from
AP
English.
Suffice
it
to
say,
high
school
over-prepared
me
for
college,
but
I
suppose
that
is
better
than
not
being
prepared
at
all.
My
Freshman
Year
Seminar
turned
out
to
be
less
of
a
challenge
than
I
expected.
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
hear
that
we
would
only
have
to
produce
three
papers
between
five
and
seven
pages
apiece.
However,
when
these
papers
were
returned
to
me
with
nothing
more
than
a
grade
on
the
top,
I
was
a
little
disappointed.
I
had
expected
to
receive
constructive
criticism
from
the
professor
who
taught
a
class
centered
around
developing
writing
skills.
I
was
hoping
to
get
some
feedback
on
my
work,
so
that
I
would
be
able
to
improve
the
skills
that
were
sub-par.
Nonetheless,
class
discussions
and
7
meetings
with
the
Writing
Associate
helped
to
focus
my
writing
and
my
papers
began
to
earn
better
grades.
College
Writing
was
a
much
better
class
for
me:
the
professor
doted
on
my
work
and
me,
complementing
and
urging
me
to
consider
becoming
an
English
major.
I
easily
completed
essays
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
class
discussions.
With
such
an
enjoyable
class,
I
discovered
I
was
looking
forward
to
writing
essays
and
doing
the
assignments.
Interestingly
enough,
this
was
not
always
the
case.
Of
course,
no
one
likes
to
do
homework,
and
writing
a
long,
involved
essay
is
much
less
appealing.
I
found
myself
completely
forgetting
that
the
assignments
were
for
school
and
getting
involved
in
a
different
way.
That,
to
me,
is
a
productive
writing
class
and
an
effective
professor.
My
options
are
still
open
for
the
future:
I
may
decide
that
I
do
want
to
become
a
journalist
or
a
novelist
and
write
for
a
living.
On
the
other
hand,
it
could
turn
out
that
mathematics
is
my
passion.
As
a
rising
college
sophomore,
the
possibilities
that
are
available
to
me
are
endless,
and
I
am
probably
going
to
try
them
all
before
settling
down
with
one
decision.
I
do
know,
however,
that
writing
is
something
that
I
have
always
been
good
at,
and
I
am
confident
I
will
be
able
to
use
writing
skills
I
have
learned
and
have
yet
to
learn
in
whatever
career
path
I
choose.
