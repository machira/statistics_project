WA
Assignment

August
2011
My
first
writing
experiences
occurred
in
the
New
World
Montessori
School
in
Hasbrouck
Heights,
New
Jersey.
As
with
all
pre-schoolers
I
was
given
a
variety
of
tools
to
learn
how
to
write.
Large
Crayola
crayons
in
their
multitude
of
colors
were
provided
to
draw
giant
circles
and
squares
instead
of
the
typical
NAOs
and
NBOs
of
the
alphabet
that
were
primarily
taught
to
pre-schoolers.
At
Montessori,
children
were
taught
to
write
before
they
were
taught
to
read.
With
the
continual
practice
of
drawing
shapes,
letters
soon
emerged
and
were
followed
by
a
newly
discovered
capacity
to
read.
Though
my
memories
have
faded
I
know
Montessori
was
the
place
where
crayons
eventually
turned
into
lead
pencils,
and
where
my
love
for
reading
accompanied
a
love
of
writing.
It
was
Montessori
where
I
was
first
exposed
to
picture
prompts
(the
simple
magazine
cut-outs)
and
where
my
first
creative
ideas
came
to
life.
In
fact,
you
can
check
your
local
library
for
The
Snow
by
Sam
and
Rentschler.
Just
kidding,
we
didnOt
get
to
publish
it,
but
I
sometimes
wonder
if
it
would
have
made
it
in
the
world
of
books
written
by
five-year
olds.
My
first
assignments
in
elementary
school
were
similar
to
those
I
completed
during
my
preschool
days.
The
topics
of
these
assignments
were
those
that
children
are
always
asked
to
write
about.
These
included
family,
pets,
summer
vacations
where
you
eat
too
much
ice
cream
while
visiting
your
grandparents,
or
your
first
trip
to
Disney
World.
I
can
recall
one
of
my
essays,
the
top
half
of
the
page
depicting
a
stick
figure
family
of
five
with
crayon
smiles
strewn
across
the
faces
followed
by
a
four-sentence,
so-called
NparagraphO
of
NWhy
I
Love
My
Family.O
My
writing
has
developed
since
then.
Unfortunately,
I
canOt
say
the
same
for
my
drawing
capabilities.
Though
my
artistic
abilities
were
nothing
spectacular,
crafts
always
seemed
to
accompany
the
basic
writing
skills
I
was
learning
in
school
during
those
early
years.
This
was
true
especially
around
the
holidays
such
as
ValentineOs
Day
or
MotherOs
Day.
Doily
hearts
sprinkled
with
loads
of
glitter
or
pasty
macaroni
necklaces
were
packaged
with
simplistic
cards
beginning
NDear
Mom
and
DadO
and
finished
with
the
usual
NLove,
Elizabeth.O
I
never
realized
their
true
significance
until
now.
Those
cards
were
the
first
examples
of
written
communication
to
people
I
loved.
By
expressing
my
affection
to
my
family,
I
was
successfully
growing
as
a
student
and
as
a
writer.
I
believe
it
was
third
grade
where
penmanship
pages
were
replaced
with
those
written
in
Times
New
Roman
on
Microsoft
Word,
and,
double-spaced,
one-inch
margin,
typed
reports
had
established
themselves
as
a
routine
part
of
my
academic
life
and
life
at
home.
Since
I
spent
countless
hours
reading
books
and
writing
short
stories,
my
mom
chose
to
enroll
me
in
an
online
program
called
NEPGYO
based
out
of
Stanford
University
in
California.
I
had
apparently
exposed
myself
to
the
world
of
Ncreative
writingO
without
even
knowing
it
simply
by
writing
about
the
things
I
loved
most:
swim
meets,
piano,
and
my
grandfather.
My
mother,
an
author,
believed
I
had
writing
capabilities
above
my
age
level.
Choosing
an
essay
titled,
NPiano,O
my
mom
submitted
an
application
on
my
behalf.
Truthfully,
participating
in
the
program
wasnOt
my
fondest
memory
of
being
an
eight-year
old.
I
didnOt
have
the
attention
span
to
sit
through
hour-long
discussions
of
book
analyses
and
stories
that
normal
kids
my
age
didnOt
routinely
read.
However,
I
did
find
it
intriguing
being
able
to
talk
with
other
students
from
around
the
world
through
a
microphone
hooked
up
to
my
computer.
I
understood
most
of
the
material
discussed
and
I
didnOt
mind
all
the
reading
assignments,
but
the
papers
werenOt
my
favorite
tasks
to
complete.
I
was
forced
to
discuss
the
usage
of
specific
literary
techniques
within
the
books
the
class
was
reading
while
I
would
have
rather
been
writing
fairytales
with
magical
princesses
off
in
Neverland.
My
creative
writing
(what
got
me
accepted
into
the
program)
wasnOt
being
strengthened.
Eventually
I
was
thankful
to
have
participated
as
my
critical
thinking
and
analytical
skills
made
huge
strides
in
their
development
due
to
the
program.
I
managed
the
course
for
two
semesters,
but
as
my
syllabus
pointed
to
NThe
CrucibleO
as
our
next
book,
my
instructor
and
parents
agreed
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
focus
on
advancing
my
reading
and
writing
abilities
within
school
instead
of
within
the
program.
As
for
school,
reports
were
assigned
at
least
twice
within
the
year
in
addition
to
every
summer.
In
elementary
school,
these
assignments
were
simply
book
reports.
As
a
student
I
can
remember
being
asked
to
summarize
a
storyOs
plot,
state
whether
or
not
I
liked
the
book,
and
to
support
my
opinions
with
reasons
why.
For
a
time,
these
reports
featured
the
prime-time
mystery
girl,
Nancy
Drew.
However,
the
Nancy
Drew
reports,
consisting
of
simple
summaries
and
opinions
in
third
and
fourth
grade,
were
soon
replaced
with
compilations
of
facts
and
statistics
of
one
of
the
fifty
states
of
America
during
my
fifth
and
final
year
of
elementary
school.
The
research
paper
(specifically
on
the
state
of
Texas)
had
made
its
grand
entrance
into
my
life,
and
I
soon
realized
it
would
never
leave.
During
middle
school
and
high
school,
research
paper
assignments
never
really
proved
to
be
challenging
for
me
to
complete.
They
did,
however,
prove
to
be
some
of
the
most
annoying
and
monotonous
assignments
I
had
ever
experienced.
From
what
I
can
remember,
many
of
the
assignments
were
on
famous
people
and
therefore
always
shared
a
similar
outline
and
structure
needed
for
a
biography.
I
was
always
bothered
by
the
forced
gathering
of
facts
from
various
sources
simply
to
fulfill
the
ridiculous
note
card
count
required
from
my
teachers.
Of
course,
the
note
cards
were
graded.
And
I
wonOt
even
start
down
the
road
of
in-text
citations.
The
tediousness
of
the
assignment
I
could
handle;
I
was
good
at
busy
work.
But
the
nature
of
the
paper
is
what
made
me
lose
total
interest.
Research
papers
on
people
(which
seemed
to
be
the
only
type
of
research
paper
I
can
remember
writing
in
middle
school
and
high
school)
are
repetitive:
fact,
citation,
fact,
citation.
Similar
to
the
papers
I
was
required
to
write
in
my
EPGY
course,
I
noticed
there
were
strict
guidelines.
There
was
no
means
for
a
writer
to
put
things
in
her
own
perspective
and
certainly
no
way
for
her
to
have
a
voice
in
this
demanding
type
of
writing.
There
was
no
room
for
me
to
use
my
imagination.
Fortunately
throughout
the
years
I
embraced
the
outlet
that
allowed
me
to
fully
express
myself
Dheart
and
soul.
Enter,
creative
writing.
I
officially
began
writing
NcreativelyO
around
sixth
grade.
Luckily,
due
to
my
momOs
organization
and
love
for
her
childrenOs
past
compositions,
I
was
able
to
find
some
of
these
first
pieces
of
writing.
They
range
from
NIf
I
Were
InvisibleO
to
NThe
Day
the
Earth
Stood
Still.O
In
the
words
of
my
brother,
I
was
taking
the
titles
of
pop
songs
and
hit
movies
and
putting
my
own,
completely
different
twist
to
them.
I
was
also
able
to
find
a
journal
of
short
stories
from
my
sixth
grade
creative
writing
class,
in
addition
to
a
notebook
of
poems
from
a
poetry
class
I
attended
in
seventh
grade.
I
notice
when
rereading
these
pieces
that
my
mind
was
vivid
and
I
paid
close
attention
to
detail,
a
comment
I
received
regularly
from
my
teachers.
I
especially
loved
to
develop
characters
and
their
conflicts
with
others.
My
stories
ranged
from
murder
mysteries
to
romance
that
I
classify
as
Npublic,O
whereas
my
poems
were
more
private.
Though
embarrassed,
IOll
admit
that
I
was
the
typical
tween
girl,
the
hopeless
romantic
who
wanted
the
happy
ending
displayed
in
a
Disney
movie.
I
still
feel
silly
when
I
read
these
poems
(hence
why
I
usually
donOt)
but
hey,
what
do
you
expect
if
all
you
read
are
Nicholas
SparksO
books?
The
persuasive
essay
or
Nfive-paragraph
essayO
made
its
debut
in
my
academic
career
around
the
same
time
I
was
officially
exposed
to
creative
writing.
The
persuasive
essay
was
the
first
genre
of
writing
where
I
was
forced
to
take
a
stance
on
a
certain
issue
or
conflict,
charged
with
the
end
goal
of
convincing
others
that
my
perspective
was
the
correct
one.
I
remember
this
type
of
writing
reappeared
when
preparing
for
standardized
tests
and
the
SATs.
Attending
public
school
in
New
Jersey,
I
was
subjected
to
several
of
these
tests
and
therefore
quickly
mastered
this
writing
technique
by
following
its
outline:
an
introductory
paragraph
with
the
last
sentence
being
the
thesis,
three
supporting
paragraphs
consisting
of
at
least
three
facts
(or
made
up
facts)
that
served
as
the
body,
followed
by
the
concluding
paragraph
that
reinstated
the
thesis
located
in
the
first
paragraph
of
the
paper.
Simple,
easy,
and
apparently
achievable
within
the
time
span
of
a
half
hour
to
an
hour,
the
five-paragraph
essay
was
the
sole
measurement
of
a
studentOs
ability
to
write.
I
realize
now
the
five-paragraph
method
was
the
only
method
that
I
remember
being
taught
in
order
to
compose
a
paper
other
than
one
specifying
research.
And
so,
since
it
had
been
burned
into
my
brain
for
five
to
seven
years,
I
thought
that
was
I
was
decently
prepared
for
Lafayette.
Obviously
my
assignments
grew
in
page
requirements,
but
my
writing
style
always
followed
the
same
structure
honoring
the
original
method.
I
was
in
for
quite
a
rude
awakening.
I
thought
it
would
be
interesting
to
take
a
class
that
didnOt
pertain
to
my
biology
major
when
I
entered
Lafayette
my
freshmen
year.
And
so,
I
willingly
registered
for
NTechnology
and
SocietyO
as
my
First
Year
Seminar.
I
expected
the
class
to
revolve
around
the
various
forms
of
technology
the
modern
world
embraces
today.
While
that
was
true,
I
wasnOt
expecting
to
have
to
calculate
the
amount
of
energy
a
desert
windmill
produces
in
California.
I
was
completely
out
of
my
element
as
the
class
was
based
purely
on
mathematic
and
scientific
calculations,
two
things
that
I
consider
my
weaknesses.
Homework
assignments
consisted
of
problems
I
found
to
be
extremely
difficult,
as
I
certainly
was
not
the
typical
engineer
student
with
the
ridiculously
strong
math
background.
Homework
problems
took
me
hours
to
complete
and
the
paper
assignments
were
no
better.
The
required
writing
usually
consisted
of
dry
facts
and
complex
calculations.
For
example,
my
final
paper
was
filled
with
approximately
ten
pages
of
equations
calculating
the
amount
of
energy
I
used
for
activities
such
as
driving
to
and
from
school
or
doing
a
load
of
laundry
using
warm
water.
My
assignment
was
to
use
numerous
calculations
to
estimate
my
carbon
footprint
for
my
senior
year
of
high
school.
I
would
be
lying
if
I
said
my
First
Year
Seminar
tore
me
to
shreds.
True,
the
material
was
difficult
for
me
to
understand,
but
it
essentially
was
research
writing,
the
kind
of
writing
that
luckily
drew
upon
my
strengths
from
high
school.
Unfortunately,
excelling
in
that
type
of
writing
would
only
last
for
so
long.
I
was
in
for
a
semesterOs
struggle
as
I
entered
my
VAST
sophomore
year.
And
so
began
NScience
vs.
Non-Science,O
a
course
requiring
diligent
note-taking
on
Powerpoint
presentations
and
the
killing
of
numerous
trees
due
to
massive
amounts
of
photocopies.
The
course
was
frustrating
as
our
paper
assignments
would
require
us
to
present
arguments
about
research
experiments
we
as
students
didnOt
understand.
I
personally
found
it
difficult
to
try
and
defend
an
argument
knowing
I
didnOt
fully
comprehend
the
resources
I
was
citing.
But
this
was
the
least
of
my
problems
as
I
discovered
I
had
quite
the
dark
cloud
lingering
over
my
head.
I
had
major
structural
issues
with
my
writing
and
the
five-paragraph
method
was
to
blame
for.
I
could
not
have
been
more
thankful
for
my
classOs
assigned
Writing
Assistant
during
my
VAST.
In
addition
to
my
Professor,
my
WA
is
the
one
I
have
to
thank
for
opening
my
eyes
to
the
correct
way
of
writing.
(My
WA
was
more
approachable
and
I
like
her
more,
so
IOll
give
her
most
of
the
credit.)
I
had
never
heard
of
a
Nthesis
evolvingO
or
even
thought
of
including
counter-arguments
into
my
essays.
In
fact,
a
NthesisO
to
my
WA
was
actually
an
NumbrellaO
idea,
an
overlying
concept
that
was
expected
to
morph
as
papers
continued
on.
And
there
I
was,
struggling,
because
I
still
thought
the
five-paragraph
method
was
the
epitome
of
all
writing.
I
clearly
had
never
been
so
wrong.
I
can
honestly
say
I
had
never
taken
such
a
challenging
course
and
believe
me--
Organic
Chemistry
is
no
joke.
Writing
was
something
I
had
been
told
I
was
NgoodO
at,
something
I
truly
believed
was
one
of
my
strengths.
My
writing
was
torn
apart
over
and
over
again
and
it
wasnOt
being
put
back
together
with
spell
check
on
Microsoft
Word.
I
needed
to
put
the
high-school
method
to
rest.
It
was
time
for
me
to
take
the
big
girl
pill,
enter
the
reality
of
college
writing,
and
grow
up.
I
had
high
hopes
of
becoming
a
Writing
Assistant
when
I
began
my
sophomore
year
at
Lafayette.
I
let
my
WA
and
my
Professor
know
this
from
the
start
and
both
gave
me
the
same
answer:
with
the
condition
my
writing
was
in,
I
was
in
for
an
uphill
battle.
And
so,
knowing
the
challenges
I
was
up
against,
fully
warned
by
my
WA
that
I
would
have
to
Nwork
my
butt
off,O
I
swallowed
my
pride
(in
addition
to
numerous
cups
of
coffee)
and
began
to
change.
NChangeO
required
learning.
Throughout
the
semester,
I
tore
up
my
own
papers,
reconstructing
and
revising
them
until
they
were
fluid
and
connected.
And
eventually,
something
clicked.
The
five-paragraph
method
was
banished
and
the
new,
improved,
college
way
of
writing
filled
with
counter-evidence
and
thesis
evolution
was
instilled
in
my
mind
for
the
many
papers
to
come.
And
so,
this
is
where
my
journey
as
a
writer
takes
hold.
As
a
Writing
Assistant,
I
plan
to
break
the
students
who
still
write
by
the
five-paragraph
method
of
their
chains
and
expose
them
to
the
reality
of
college
writing.
IOm
a
prime
example
of
how
people
can
grow
as
writers
while
surviving
typical
high
school
writing
techniques.
I
understand
the
fear
of
being
forced
out
of
a
comfort
zone
(believe
me,
my
first
all
nighter
wasnOt
pretty)
but
know
there
is
a
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel.
I
fully
believe
while
working
with
and
learning
from
others
that
these
students
will
be
able
to
strengthen
and
develop
their
capabilities
as
writers.
And
knowing
I
get
to
help
is
the
most
exciting
thing
of
all.
