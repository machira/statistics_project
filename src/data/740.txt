My
History
as
a
Writer
Throughout
my
childhood,
writing
was
always
a
fun
pastime
and
a
much
needed
outlet.
Whether
I
was
in
school,
at
home
or
even
on
family
vacation,
I
always
brought
a
pencil
and
notebook.
For
me,
writing
was
a
way
to
bring
my
stories
to
life
and
let
my
imagination
expand
and
explore.
My
writing
remained
steady
and
strong
through
elementary
school
and
middle
school,
being
one
of
my
favorite
subjects
and
hobbies.
Somewhere
along
the
timeline
between
high
school
and
college,
writing
went
from
something
I
loved
to
do,
to
something
I
dreaded
and
avoided.
Through
reflecting
on
my
history
as
a
writer,
I
am
realizing
which
experiences,
both
positive
and
negative,
most
shaped
how
I
am
as
a
writer
today.
My
first
writing
act
as
a
toddler
was
well
before
a
can
remember,
so
for
the
following
story
I
asked
my
parents.
Around
the
age
of
two
my
mom
taught
me
how
to
write
my
name.
Though
my
name
is
spelled
LUCY,
I
mixed
up
the
U
and
C,
often
resulting
in
LCUY.
To
me
UOs
and
COs
were
too
similar.
While
this
story
is
not
something
I
can
remember,
I
do
recall
through
kindergarten
still
mixing
up
my
COs
and
UOs,
but
only
when
spelling
my
name.
This
is
undoubtedly
because
I
had
unknowingly
spelled
my
name
wrong
for
so
many
years!
My
mom
told
me
that
I
was
so
enthusiastic
about
labeling
everything
as
my
own
with
my
name,
that
I
drew
all
over
our
house
walls
and
floors
with
marker.
In
response,
my
parents
got
me
sidewalk
chalk,
after
which
I
spent
hours
every
day
drawing
and
writing
my
name
in
the
driveway.
My
earliest
memories
of
writing
are
of
my
kindergarten
year
in
school.
In
class
everyday
we
had
a
book
read
aloud
to
us,
then
we
were
asked
to
write
a
sentence
about
something
in
the
book.
If
we
did
not
know
how
to
write
a
word
we
were
expected
to
draw
a
little
picture
of
it.
So
for
instance,
if
I
did
not
know
how
to
spell
NtreehouseO,
I
could
draw
a
tiny
tree
with
a
house
in
the
branches
mid-sentence.
Despite
this
creative
way
of
expressing
words
we
could
not
spell,
I
was
determined
to
never
draw
any
little
pictures
no
matter
how
long
it
took
me
to
come
up
with
a
reasonable
phonetic
spelling.
When
I
would
return
home
from
school
I
wanted
to
practice
writing.
My
favorite
writing
exercise
was
to
play
music
and
write
down
every
single
lyric
on
pieces
of
paper.
Since
I
was
constantly
using
up
every
piece
of
paper
in
the
fax
machine,
my
parents
bought
me
a
huge
roll
of
paper
about
three
feet
wide.
Now,
my
song
lyrics
were
written
on
paper
from
the
roll
that
would
span
the
length
of
our
entire
kitchen
floor.
Once
the
song
lyrics
were
complete,
I
would
cut
the
paper
from
the
big
roll,
have
all
family
members
around
sing
the
song
with
me
(looking
at
my
lyrics
of
course),
and
then
finally
I
would
roll
it
up
with
a
little
song
label
and
hide
it
under
my
bed.
Another
interest
that
I
had
as
a
child
which
I
associated
with
writing
was
coloring.
One
of
my
favorite
activities
was
carefully
filling
in
coloring
books,
though
after
the
picture
was
completely
colored,
I
was
far
from
being
finished;
every
picture
had
a
story
that
needed
to
be
told.
While
coloring
each
picture,
I
would
be
formulating
some
intricate
story
about
the
character
or
scene
in
the
picture.
When
finished
coloring,
I
would
write
a
handful
of
sentences
around
the
perimeter
of
the
picture.
Sometimes
when
I
had
too
much
to
say
in
the
story,
I
would
tape
a
piece
of
paper
to
the
bottom
of
the
drawing
and
continue
the
story
there.
This
was
my
way
of
trying
to
make
a
book.
I
saved
each
picture
with
its
story
in
my
dadOs
office,
and
when
I
had
enough
my
dad
would
staple
the
pictures
together
with
a
blank
page
as
the
front
so
I
could
make
a
title
and
decorate
the
front
cover.
Today,
my
homemade
books
still
reside
in
my
dadOs
office
desk
drawer,
and
whenever
I
visit
there
I
get
much
amusement
out
of
reading
through
them.
When
I
got
to
first
grade,
we
had
weekly
journal
assignments.
In
our
journals,
we
were
assigned
to
describe
everything
you
did
for
one
entire
day,
from
brushing
your
teeth
to
what
you
did
at
recess
time.
At
first
I
though
the
journal
assignments
were
super
boring
and
a
pain
to
write,
but
about
half
way
through
the
year
I
began
to
see
the
appeal.
I
found
it
entertaining
and
interesting
to
look
back
and
read
about
days
I
had
completely
forgotten
about,
and
things
that
worried
me
which
turned
out
to
be
no
big
deal
at
all
and
seemed
silly
looking
back
at.
This
was
when
I
had
the
realization
that
my
daily
life
could
be
a
story
just
as
the
characters
in
my
book.
This
marked
a
huge
turning
point
in
my
writing
career.
From
this
time
on,
I
began
keeping
a
journal
about
my
daily
life.
I
never
wrote
anything
personal
or
embarrassing
in
fear
that
someone
else
would
read
it,
but
instead
described
in
painstaking
detail
everything
about
my
days.
On
vacations
especially,
when
I
had
a
lot
to
say,
I
could
be
found
writing
at
the
table,
at
the
beach,
in
the
car
or
in
bed.
These
writings
were
never
in
a
physical
journal,
but
on
double-sided
lined
pieces
of
paper
torn
out
of
school
notebooks.
This
intense
journaling
lasted
on
and
off
all
the
way
until
the
end
of
elementary
school.
Middle
school
was
when
my
teachers
began
introducing
various
genres
of
writing.
I
was
assigned
to
write
book
reports,
arguments
and
mostly
research
papers.
These
were
not
forms
of
writing
that
I
found
particularly
exciting,
and
my
enthusiasm
for
writing
was
quickly
extinguished.
At
the
same
time,
we
began
using
computers
to
write
our
papers.
I
had
scheduling
conflicts,
so
throughout
my
four
years
of
middle
school
I
never
once
took
a
typing
class.
Hence,
I
was
a
terribly
clumsy
and
slow
typer,
and
still
am
to
this
day.
I
must
note
that
at
this
time
I
also
began
using
social
media
such
as
instant
messaging,
which
took
up
the
time
I
would
have
been
journaling.
High
school
was
generally
the
same
as
middle
school
with
a
mix
of
argument
papers
and
research
papers.
By
this
time
I
was
the
slowest
typist
in
all
of
my
English
classes,
and
at
boarding
school
a
great
portion
of
writing
assignments
were
in-class
timed
and
typed
essays.
I
know
the
smart
thing
to
do
would
have
been
to
take
a
typing
course
or
teach
myself,
but
I
didnOt.
Writing
was
stressful
and
a
constant
struggle
for
me
through
high
school.
Teachers
constantly
commented
that
I
wrote
well,
but
they
saw
a
lack
of
confidence
that
was
holding
me
back.
I
was
frustrated
by
these
comments
because
I
didnOt
know
how
to
gain
confidence
or
even
fake
confidence
in
my
writing.
Despite
feeling
discouraged
about
my
writing,
I
still
felt
adequately
prepared
for
college
level
writing.
Boarding
school
may
have
dampened
my
confidence,
but
I
knew
their
incredibly
high
expectations
and
rigorous
curriculum
were
only
making
me
a
better
writer.
I
was
also
working
with
fellow
students
who
I
knew
were
amazing
writers,
and
I
learned
just
as
much
from
peer
editing
their
papers
as
from
my
class
lectures.
When
I
took
my
first
college
writing
class,
I
expected
to
fit
right
in
as
one
of
the
average
level
writers.
To
my
surprise,
professors
gave
me
highly
positive
comments
and
feedback,
and
my
paper
grades
were
well
above
what
they
had
been
in
high
school.
I
undoubtedly
have
a
lot
to
work
on,
but
it
seems
I
have
a
strong
writing
foundation
to
build
upon.
Looking
back
through
my
years
of
writing,
it
is
not
hard
to
pick
out
my
best
writing
experience.
When
I
was
in
second
grade,
my
family
took
a
trip
to
the
Cayman
Islands
to
visit
my
grandparents
who
spent
winters
there.
Since
I
was
missing
a
few
days
of
school,
my
teacher
had
given
me
a
small
list
of
make-up
assignments,
and
one
of
these
assignments
was
to
write
a
poem.
At
the
time,
I
knew
nothing
of
poem
structure
and
format
other
than
they
often
had
rhyming
words.
I
decided
to
write
a
poem
about
the
ocean
and
beach,
but
I
made
two
copies;
one
copy
was
for
my
teacher
and
the
other
was
for
my
grandfather.
My
grandfather
was
well
into
his
eighties
and
I
absolutely
idolized
him.
To
my
delight
he
hung
my
poem
on
the
wall
in
his
house.
The
following
year,
though
I
did
not
have
an
assignment
to
write
poetry,
my
grandfather
asked
me
to
write
him
another
poem.
That
was
the
beginning
of
a
very
special
relationship
with
my
grandfather.
Until
he
passed
away
this
year
at
the
age
of
99,
he
and
I
wrote
letters
back
and
forth
every
few
months
containing
poems
I
wrote
for
him.
I
was
by
no
means
a
talented
poet,
but
he
loved
reading
my
poems,
and
together
we
bonded
over
writing.
When
I
was
first
introduced
to
the
challenge
of
reflecting
on
myself
as
a
writer
and
creating
a
narrative,
I
could
not
imagine
that
anything
remotely
interesting
could
be
recalled
in
my
writing
career.
Writing
is
a
skill
which
I
assume
every
child
who
goes
through
the
education
system
is
taught
to
do.
While
there
may
be
differences
in
school
writing
curriculums,
every
student
is
taught
some
general
basics,
which
are
built
upon
as
they
become
more
experienced
writers.
What
I
had
not
thought
about
was
how
writing
affects
each
personOs
life
in
unique
ways,
and
how
writing
experiences
can
shape
other
aspects
of
life
such
as
relationships,
social
communication,
emotional
self-discovery,
etc.
While
academic
writing
is
not
currently
a
large
part
of
my
student
life,
I
can
now
see
how
learning
to
write
through
elementary
and
middle
school
helped
shape
and
develop
personal
characteristics
and
qualities
which
I
have
today.
When
I
first
learned
to
write,
I
used
the
medium
to
explore
my
thoughts
and
develop
a
sense
of
independence.
Writing
became
a
challenge
which
drove
me
to
put
in
extra
work,
fueling
academic
motivation
which
carried
over
into
other
classes
and
various
parts
of
my
everyday
life.
After
reflecting
on
my
writing
history,
I
have
learned
valuable
information
about
myself
as
both
a
writer
and
a
person.
