Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative
The
continuing
growth
and
development
of
writing
skills
is
the
most
important
area
of
continuing
education.
Every
writing
exercise
is
a
challenge
for
writers
to
assess,
strategize
over,
and
solve.
Since
becoming
a
Writing
Associate
last
fall,
I
have
continued
my
writing
education
on
two
levels:
as
a
WA
and
a
student.
The
past
year
has
offered
me
a
plethora
of
writing
opportunities,
both
formal
and
informal.
Through
my
work
as
a
WA,
classes
at
Lafayette,
classes
at
the
University
of
Westminster
while
abroad,
and
job
as
a
legal
assistant,
I
have
faced
many
writing
challenges.
Each
experience
required
me
to
approach
writing
from
a
different
perspective,
offered
a
different
challenge,
and
helped
develop
a
different
aspect
of
my
writing
identity.
Working
as
a
WA
last
year
was
a
challenging,
but
rewarding
experience.
Being
a
WA
has
taught
me
that
no
two
writers
are
exactly
alike.
There
may
be
similarities,
but
ultimately,
each
and
every
student
writes
in
a
unique
manner.
It
takes
time
to
get
to
know
someone
as
a
writer
in
order
to
tailor
your
conferences
and
work
to
meet
their
specific
needs.
As
a
WA,
IOve
had
the
challenging
opportunity
to
work
with
a
student
who
was
an
English
language
learner.
This
student
was
incredibly
motivated
throughout
the
entire
course,
and
determined
to
improve
with
each
paper.
The
studentOs
sheer
enthusiasm
for
the
College
Writing
Program
and
conferences
was
refreshing,
and
even
at
times,
inspiring.
As
we
worked
together,
I
began
to
understand
how
different
approaches
to
writing
conferences
worked
for
different
students,
and
how
the
tone
of
a
conference
can
influence
its
outcome.
The
student
was
excited
about
the
hands
on
approach
to
conferences,
and
had
an
upbeat
tone
that
focused
on
both
further
development
and
improvement
of
existing
skills
and
the
development
of
new
skills,
which
reflected
in
our
meetings.
My
writing
has
also
developed
outside
of
my
official
involvement
with
the
College
Writing
Program.
Through
my
experiences
in
the
past
year,
I
have:
studied
abroad,
enrolled
in
classes
to
fulfill
an
English
minor,
and
worked
as
a
legal
assistant.
This
past
fall,
through
the
English
courses
I
took
at
Lafayette,
I
further
developed
the
academic
portion
of
my
writing
identity.
I
became
more
aware
of
how
I
prepare
for
a
paper
through
a
process
of
brainstorming,
discussion,
and
drafting.
I
began
to
realize
how
important
these
first
steps
of
the
process
are
in
focusing
your
writing.
The
more
detail
oriented
and
specific
the
planning
and
preparations
are,
the
more
smoothly
the
drafting
process
should
proceed.
There
is
one
specific
experience
from
my
process
of
paper
development
last
fall
that
I
brought
into
my
approach
to
WA
conferences.
Last
fall,
frustrated
with
the
opening
of
a
paper,
I
went
to
office
hours
to
discuss
it
with
my
professor.
I
had
edited
it
multiple
times,
but
was
still
unhappy
with
the
product
and
was
at
a
lost
for
how
to
proceed.
My
professor
suggested
that
I
read
the
passage
aloud.
In
doing
so,
I
was
able
to
identify
many
of
my
own
trouble
spots.
I
was
surprised
at
this
approach.
After
discussing
my
paper,
the
professor
and
I
discussed
the
notion
of
reading
aloud
as
a
writing
tool,
and
how
it
was
an
alternative
way
to
approach
conferences.
He
also
suggested
it
as
a
tool
to
use
in
a
conference
where
a
student
fails
to
submit
the
paper
prior
to
meeting
time.
During
my
next
round
of
conferences,
I
inevitably
had
at
least
one
student
who
forgot
to
submit
his
paper.
Rather
than
ask
him
to
wait
for
a
few
minutes
while
I
read
over
it,
I
suggested
that
we
read
it
aloud,
paragraph
by
paragraph
in
an
empty
classroom
to
avoid
disturbing
the
other
conferences
in
the
packed
WA
room.
This
method
allowed
us
to
hear
the
paper
together,
and
discuss
each
paragraph,
with
less
time
wasted
on
me
reading
the
late
paper.
In
several
instances,
he
realized
his
own
grammatical
errors
and
raised
questions
and
concerns
about
structure,
format,
and
flow
of
the
text.
Last
fall,
I
also
participated
in
a
class
that
encouraged
peer
review
of
papers
by
your
fellow
classmates,
and
I
worked
with
a
fellow
WA.
As
we
WAed
each
otherOs
papers
for
our
English
class,
we
both
started
to
approach
our
conferences
with
an
expanded
knowledge
about
how
it
feels
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
conference
worksheet.
I
believe
it
was
beneficial
for
me
to
go
through
the
peer
review
process
while
being
a
WA.
It
strengthened
the
way
I
approached
and
conducted
my
conferences.
The
peer
review
sessions
from
my
class
helped
me
to
realize
different
approaches
to
the
questions
I
was
asking
in
conferences.
In
class,
I
could
see
not
only
what
worked
and
helped
me,
but
also
what
worked
for
or
helped
other
students,
as
after
each
round
of
peer
review,
the
class
would
discuss
how
the
sessions
went.
I
was
able
to
see
how
to
approach
the
same
assignment
in
several
different
ways.
I
found
the
peer
review
process
helped
me
both
in
the
classroom
and
in
the
WA
room.
I
learned
not
only
how
to
improve
my
own
writing
but
also,
different
ways
to
approach
students
about
writing.
What
I
enjoyed
most
about
these
peer
review
conferences
was
the
trust
and
faith
I
had
in
my
reviewer.
I
never
felt
embarrassed
or
shy
when
discussing
my
writing
with
her,
which
has
always
been
a
challenge
for
me.
The
atmosphere
of
our
meetings
fostered
thought
and
discussion
about
the
paper
through
a
one-on-one
approach.
I
tried
to
create
an
atmosphere
similar
to
that
by
attempting
to
make
the
student
feel
that
he
or
she
was
not
one
in
fifteen
students
that
I
needed
to
see,
but
rather,
the
only
student
I
was
working
with.
I
tried
to
create
this
by
moving
conferences
into
empty
classrooms
when
the
WA
room
was
crowded
or
noisy,
so
that
students
wouldnOt
feel
overwhelmed
or
like
they
were
part
of
some
sort
of
massive
writing
system.
I
also
carefully
reviewed
the
personal
notes
both
from
my
last
conference
with
the
student
and
my
meeting
with
my
partner
professor.
I
used
our
meetings
to
help
focus
and
tailor
my
conferences
to
a
studentOs
individual
needs
in
the
same
way
that
my
peer
reviewer
did
for
me.
My
writing
identity
has
continued
to
refine
itself
away
from
Lafayette
as
well.
This
spring,
I
studied
abroad
in
London,
England
at
the
University
of
Westminster.
In
addition
to
immersing
myself
in
British
culture,
I
also
immersed
myself
in
the
British
higher
education
system.
Attending
a
real
British
institution
instead
of
an
American
universityOs
London
campus
definitely
impacted
my
development
as
a
writer.
Besides
the
obvious
differences
in
spelling
in
American
and
British
English,
(think
organise
as
opposed
to
organize)
British
students
tend
to
approach
writing
slightly
differently
than
I
do.
As
I
was
enrolled
in
two
politics
classes
and
two
literature
classes,
I
was
exposed
to
multiple
genres
of
writing.
For
the
politics
classes,
the
format
and
structure
of
research
papers
was
different
than
in
America.
I
found
that
many
of
my
classmates
wrote
in
a
different
tense
or
voice
than
I
expected.
In
my
English
Literature
courses,
I
had
to
adapt
to
meet
the
stringent
requirements
and
low
word
counts.
I
found
the
word
count
restrictions
particularly
hard
to
deal
with.
It
seemed
that
assignments
were
expected
to
be
completed
with
greater
brevity
than
back
home,
and
sometimes
I
felt
that
the
limits
prevented
me
from
expressing
full
ideas.
One
thing
that
I
marveled
at
in
Westminster
was
its
lack
of
a
writing
center.
An
institution
like
the
College
Writing
program
simply
did
not
exist.
The
University
of
WestminsterOs
student
body
is
about
eight
times
the
size
of
LafayetteOs
and
spread
over
four
campuses
in
central
London.
However,
I
was
shocked
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
writing
center
to
help
students.
If
there
was
anything
like
the
CWP
at
Westminster,
it
was
not
advertised,
promoted,
or
even
offered
as
a
viable
option
to
improve
your
writing.
In
my
attempts
to
adapt
to
the
British
writing
norms
at
Westminster,
a
CWP
would
have
been
an
excellent
resource.
The
lessons
I
learned
in
adjusting
my
writing
to
reflect
the
different
regulations
and
requirements
have
the
potential
to
help
me
as
a
WA.
When
transitioning
into
the
British
educational
system,
I
had
to
update
and
adjust
my
writing
to
reflect
the
new
requirements
and
expectations
set
forth
by
a
different
system.
This
transition
is
similar
in
some
respects
to
the
transition
a
writer
makes
between
high
school
and
college.
When
transitioning
between
these
two
levels
of
education,
a
writer
must
meet
new
and
usually
higher
expectations
at
the
college
level.
There
are
also
different
requirements
for
some
writers,
depending
on
their
backgrounds.
For
example,
differing
citation
styles
or
a
formal
drafting
process
in
which
you
work
with
another
person
can
be
new
challenges
to
some
first
year
writers.
By
having
to
go
through
the
process
of
learning
to
write
for
an
audience
under
new
and
complex
circumstances
again,
I
have
a
sharper
understanding
of
the
confusion
that
accompanies
the
process.
Learning
to
write
in
a
new
academic
setting
can
be
an
incredibly
frustrating
experience.
It
directly
challenges
your
belief
and
confidence
in
your
own
writing
abilities.
I
found
that
through
the
help
and
support
of
my
fellow
study
abroad
students
and
students
who
had
previously
studied
abroad,
I
was
able
to
adjust
to
the
new
circumstances.
By
discussing
the
expectations
and
challenges
we
faced
and
the
requirements
of
the
new
system,
we
were
able
to
help
each
other
better
understand
how
to
approach
different
writing
projects.
During
the
revision
process,
discussion
and
collaboration
with
others
was
the
most
helpful
resource
I
had
available
to
me
while
abroad.
I
have
also
had
to
adjust
my
writing
for
different
audiences
while
working
during
school
breaks.
During
the
past
four
summer
and
winter
breaks,
I
have
worked
as
a
legal
assistant/office
clerk
for
a
small
law
firm
in
Manhattan.
Some
of
my
duties
include
drafting
and
revising
both
correspondence
and
court
papers,
in
addition
to
editing
bills,
typing
inter-office
memos
and
sending
out
informational
e-mails
to
clients.
Writing
for
a
legal
audience
is
much
different
than
writing
for
an
academic
audience.
The
wording
of
legal
document
is
incredibly
important
as
it
effects
how
it
will
be
read
and
interpreted
by
a
judge.
In
law,
although
it
may
not
seem
so,
brevity
is
incredibly
important.
In
legal
writing,
it
is
important
to
use
the
technical
jargon,
be
concise,
but
still
convey
your
complete
argument
or
message.
Legal
correspondence
also
has
to
be
clear
and
concise,
and
when
dealing
with
adverse
parties,
must
be
transparent
without
offering
too
much
information.
My
legal
writing
experience,
gained
through
light
secretarial
work,
has
helped
me
see
how
challenging
it
can
be
for
one
to
write
for
a
new
audience
in
a
different
genre
and
move
outside
oneOs
comfort
zone.
I
now
understand
how
challenging
writing
for
a
science
class
can
be
for
a
linguistics
or
humanities
student,
and
vice-versa.
It
is
difficult
to
know
what
to
expect
when
writing
in
a
different
genre,
but
my
experiences
as
a
WA
have
helped
me.
Working
as
a
WA,
especially
during
drop-in
hours,
has
shown
me
how
diverse
writing
genres
are
and
it
is
both
intimidating
and
exciting
to
work
with
so
many
different
kinds
of
writing.
I
have
used
my
experience
dealing
with
different
genres
as
a
WA
by
looking
critically
at
the
task
I
am
assigned
and
approaching
it
from
a
perspective
that
may
be
new
or
different.
It
has
also
taught
me
to
not
be
afraid
to
ask
questions
about
the
technicality
or
format
of
a
piece,
as
well
as
factors
such
as
voice
and
tense.
As
for
the
advice
I
can
offer
to
new
WAs,
patience
and
understanding,
coupled
with
dedication
to
the
job
are
vital
to
both
your
student
writerOs
experience
and
your
own.
It
is
important
to
remember
what
it
was
like
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
conference
worksheet.
Before
your
first
round
of
conferences,
reflect
upon
your
experiences
as
a
student
turning
to
the
CWP
for
guidance
during
FYS,
VaST,
and
drop-in,
and
use
these
experiences
to
help
make
you
a
better
WA.
In
addition
to
the
focus
on
patience,
understanding,
and
dedication,
the
single
most
important
thing
you
can
do
as
a
WA
is
develop
a
healthy
working
relationship
with
your
partner
professor.
The
professor-WA
relationship
is
an
integral
part
of
your
time
as
a
WA.
Building
a
partnership
with
your
classO
professor
is
the
first
thing
a
new
WA
should
do.
My
partner
professor
last
fall
was
everything
a
WA
could
have
hoped
for
and
more.
He
was
incredibly
supportive
of
me
as
a
WA
and
was
integral
in
helping
me
regain
order
with
respect
to
due
dates
and
draft
length
when
the
class
became
unruly.
It
is
a
great
relief
and
helps
to
know
that
you
are
supported
by
your
professor.
Maintain
an
open
dialogue
with
him
or
her.
When
in
doubt
ask
a
question,
when
confused,
ask
for
a
clarification.
I
could
not
have
had
a
better
first
experience
working
with
a
partner
professor
than
last
fall.
My
partner
professor
and
I
met
prior
to
conferences
to
discuss
direction,
common
issues
from
the
previous
round,
etc.
and
then
after
conferences
were
completed
to
discuss
any
issues,
concerns,
and
the
general
proceedings.
We
would
discuss
each
students
paper
individually
as
well
as
the
classO
work
as
a
whole.
These
conversations
enabled
me
to
better
tailor
conferences
to
suit
each
student
individual
needs
as
best
I
could.
Finally,
get
to
know
your
students.
They
should
be
more
than
just
faces
and
names.
The
more
approachable
you
are,
the
more
your
students
will
get
to
know
you,
and
hopefully,
trust
you.
This
will
create
a
better
environment
to
foster
discussions
about
their
writing.
In
looking
at
the
upcoming
semester,
I
hold
high
hopes
for
not
the
development
of
my
writing
identity,
but
also
for
my
development
as
a
WA.
In
my
final
year
of
college,
I
hope
to
further
develop
the
skills
I
have
learned,
and
become
stronger
in
the
face
of
the
challenges
and
stumbling
blocks
that
writing
will
present.
Being
a
WA
has
made
me
look
at
my
own
writing
more
critically
and
honestly.
There
was
a
time
when
I
was
nervous
about
reaching
out
for
help,
guidance,
and
support
because
I
feared
being
viewed
weak
or
inadequate
writer.
Now,
I
realize
that
reaching
out
is
in
fact,
a
quality
of
not
only
a
dedicated
growing
writer,
but
also
a
writing
quality
that
I
admire
and
respect.
IOm
more
likely
to
ask
for
guidance
or
help,
and
make
my
best
effort
to
approach
others
commentaries
and
critiques
with
an
open
mind.
