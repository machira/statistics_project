WA
Summer
Writing
Assignment
My
earliest
memory
of
writing
was
making
a
card
in
my
kindergarten
class.
We
sat
in
small
clusters
D
four
child-sized
desks
with
little
chairs,
name
tags
taped
down
to
the
top
of
the
desk,
our
names
written
in
clear
block
letters.
The
crayons
came
in
thin
yellow
and
green
boxes,
smaller
than
the
box
I
had
at
home,
and
I
remember
using
the
black
crayons
for
words
and
saving
the
other
colors
for
the
artwork.
Our
teacher
had
handed
out
a
blank
sheet
of
paper,
heavy
white
construction
paper,
that
we
folded
in
half
and
drew
pictures
of
our
family
on
the
front.
When
we
opened
up
the
paper
and
stared
at
the
empty
page,
I
remember
how
hard
it
was
to
find
the
right
thing
to
put
down.
Even
at
that
early
age,
I
had
a
vague
understanding
of
how
important
it
was
to
find
the
correct
words.
Pads
of
off-white
construction
paper
and
jumbo
crayons
that
threatened
to
overwhelm
my
small
hands
were
the
tools
of
my
creativity.
My
house
was
littered
with
little
books
that
I
had
OpublishedO
by
stapling
together
half
sheets
of
computer
paper.
I
loved
to
print
my
full
name
out
on
the
paper,
the
size
increasing
as
I
wrote
out
my
last
name
until
it
threatened
to
overwhelm
the
paper.
There
was
no
sense
of
writing
as
a
task,
something
done
for
a
purpose
D
it
was
just
something
that
everyone
around
me
did
so
naturally
and
fluidly.
Growing
up
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
writing
was
work;
I
associated
it
with
the
familiar,
like
the
Christmas
tree
my
father
put
up
in
our
living
room
every
year.
I
cannot
remember
when
my
view
of
writing
shifted
D
maybe
it
was
in
the
third
grade,
and
the
only
reason
I
chose
that
year
as
a
point
of
reference
is
because
I
remember
having
to
sit
in
the
library
of
our
elementary
school
and
chose
a
book
for
our
book
reports.
The
library
was
always
cold,
too
cold
in
comparison
to
our
un-air-conditioned
classrooms,
and
it
was
always
a
relief
to
go
back
to
the
rows
of
desks
with
our
new
book
in
tow.
That
was
one
of
the
first
times
I
remember
consciously
thinking
about
different
kinds
of
writing
D
school
writing
was
different
than
anything
else
because
we
had
to
use
cursive
letters
and
blue
pen.
I
always
wanted
to
use
my
purple
pen,
it
seemed
more
glamorous
than
the
dull
blue
that
everyone
else
in
the
class
used;
this
was
one
of
the
first
times
I
remember
making
a
division
between
academic
and
personal
writing.
My
writing
used
to
fall
into
two
separate
categories:
the
work
I
did
for
school
and
the
short
journal
entries
that
I
scribbled
with
a
ballpoint
pen
that
my
dad
had
brought
home
from
a
hotel
or
business
convention.
There
was
a
line,
distinguishable
only
to
me,
between
the
two
situations
when
I
put
pen
to
paper.
The
circumstances,
expectations,
and
audience
were
drastically
different.
My
personal
notebooks,
filled
with
half-finished
poems,
scribbled
character
sketches,
and
hastily
written
lines
of
dialogue,
were
always
kept
separate
from
the
neatly
written
assignments
that
were
passed
in
to
my
teachers.
To
break
through
that
barrier
would
mean
exposing
my
inner
most
thoughts
to
an
unforgiving
audience;
when
I
wrote
for
myself
the
words
could
flow
and
I
did
not
have
to
make
sure
they
were
spelled
correctly,
or
that
commas
and
periods
were
placed
correctly.
Writing
for
school
became
a
task,
something
that
was
not
very
enjoyable,
since
academic
writing
became
associated
with
five-page
book
reports
written
out
by
hand,
skipping
every
other
line.
In
middle
school
I
encountered
a
teacher
who
made
me
love
English
D
she
was
in
charge
of
the
Gifted
and
Talented
program.
Every
Tuesday
the
group
of
us
who
had
been
identified
by
our
elementary
school
teachers
as
OadvancedO
would
leave
our
comfortable
classrooms
and
travel
to
the
other
end
of
the
school
building.
Down
the
main
hallway,
past
the
main
office,
turning
left
before
we
exited
the
building,
we
traveled
every
week
to
108A
D
NancyOs
classroom.
She
encouraged
creativity,
writing
all
of
her
comments
on
our
papers
in
purple
pen,
and
challenged
us
to
think
beyond
the
narrow
confines
of
our
twelve-year
old
universes.
Nancy
was
passionate
about
writing
and
teaching,
and
spending
that
extra
hour
a
week
in
class
with
her
had
a
profound
affect
on
my
writing.
She
despised
mediocre
work
and
demanded
that
we
push
ourselves
to
do
better
and
to
think
broader.
Under
her
mentoring
I
learned
how
to
transform
poetry
from
a
rigid
formulaic
concoction
of
syllables,
into
an
outlet
for
my
confused
and
turbulent
emotions.
Her
classroom
was
the
first
place
that
I
remember
learning
about
voice,
and
how
important
it
was
to
command
the
words
that
we
had
drafted
onto
paper.
High
school
was
a
different
environment
for
my
writing
D
I
was
not
comfortable
sharing
my
personal
poetry
and
fiction
with
others,
but
had
reached
a
point
where
I
was
not
as
intimidated
by
the
thought
of
an
essay
or
research
paper.
The
hurdle
that
I
confronted
during
my
freshman
year
of
high
school
was
a
bull-like
stubbornness;
I
understood
the
assignments
laid
out
on
the
page
that
had
been
handed
out
by
my
teachers,
but
I
fought
every
single
word
that
I
typed
onto
the
Word
document.
I
made
essays
harder
and
research
papers
more
troublesome.
There
was
no
easy
rhythm
and
flow
to
my
writing;
it
often
felt
disjointed
and
pieced
together.
I
remember
another
teacher
whose
quirky
taste
in
authors
and
random
assortment
of
course
readings
changed
the
way
I
wrote.
It
was
my
junior
year
of
high
school,
the
year
when
we
were
lectured
by
our
teachers
that
it
was
necessary
to
learn
how
to
write
college
essays;
everything
was
so
serious
because
the
year
after,
our
senior
year,
was
so
incredibly
important.
The
overwhelming
pressure
for
us
to
mature
as
writers
would
have
been
unbearable,
except
that
our
teacher
believed
in
serenity
and
gradual
progress.
She
started
us
out
slowly,
with
compare
and
contrast
essays,
choosing
as
our
topic
works
of
literature
that
we
struggled
to
get
through;
not
because
they
were
too
difficult,
but
because
they
were
dense.
And
as
sixteen
year
old
honor
students,
we
did
not
want
to
work
with
books
that
were
dense;
fortunately
for
us,
our
teacher
did
not
listen
to
our
almost
constant
complaining
and
insisted
that
we
learn
to
appreciate
and
analyze
dense
works.
It
was
this
particular
year
in
my
long
string
of
valuable
writing
lessons
that
I
learned
to
not
be
intimidated
by
an
assignment;
over
time
I
have
become
very
comfortable
with
writing
on
different
topics
and
approaching
issues
from
different
angles.
The
more
papers
I
wrote,
the
more
critical
my
writing
became;
I
learned
how
to
narrow
my
focus
until
the
essays
were
concentrated
around
a
certain
topic,
and
not
jumping
back
and
forth
from
relevant
material
to
unnecessary
fluff.
A
creative
writing
class
in
high
school
was
one
of
the
first
times
I
remember
having
to
blur
the
line
between
academic
and
personal
writing.
My
teachers
would
not
accept
silence
as
an
excuse
to
not
read
our
work
aloud,
and
I
was
encouraged
to
read
my
poems
and
in-class
writings
aloud.
Encouraged
is
a
misleading
term,
since
the
initial
reading
of
my
personal
writing
to
an
audience
was
one
of
the
most
terrifying
and
nauseating
experiences
of
my
life.
I
can
still
remember
staring
at
the
notebook
paper,
looking
at
the
words
I
had
scribbled
down,
and
wishing
that
I
could
have
written
something
more
creative,
something
that
would
meet
up
to
my
teacherOs
expectations
and
impress
my
classmates.
I
had
teachers
who
encouraged
moving
beyond
the
assigned
topic
throughout
middle
and
high
school.
This
allowed
me
to
begin
to
develop
my
own
style,
since
I
was
still
clinging
to
the
basic
five
paragraph
structure
that
had
been
drilled
into
my
head
in
eighth
grade.
Many
of
my
teachers
encouraged
me
to
take
risks
with
my
writing,
but
at
the
same
time
they
demanded
excellence.
Even
though
I
took
honors
classes
in
high
school,
there
were
certain
teachers
who
refused
to
let
me
fall
into
a
comfortable
rut
with
my
writing.
They
changed
the
parameters
of
assignments,
forcing
students
to
think
outside
the
proverbial
box,
and
to
bring
our
own
ideas
and
experiences
to
the
particular
assignment.
This
style
of
teaching
was
something
that
I
was
not
familiar
with,
as
a
junior
in
high
school,
having
always
had
teachers
who
supported
using
tested
formulas
for
essay
writing,
and
following
a
set
structure.
Many
of
my
teachers
in
high
school
encouraged
me
to
try
different
genres
D
poetry
for
the
literary
magazine,
editorial
work
for
the
school
newspaper,
an
op-ed
piece
for
the
paper
D
making
me
stretch
beyond
the
comfortable
confines
of
the
classroom
that
I
had
written
in
for
years.
One
of
the
most
daunting
things
for
me
about
writing
has
always
been
the
freedom
D
there
are
innumerable
topics
that
can
be
ruminated
upon
in
an
essay,
or
highlighted
in
a
piece
of
prose.
Writers
must
narrow
their
focus
enough
so
that
the
readers
have
an
idea
of
what
is
being
addressed,
but
not
so
much
so
that
the
piece
of
writing
becomes
a
trite
recitation
of
other
peopleOs
ideas.
The
revision
process
has
been
an
amazing
way
for
me
to
focus
and
refine
my
voice;
I
used
to
think
that
revising
a
paper
meant
re-reading
it
quickly
for
spelling
and
grammatical
errors.
Now
I
look
at
revision
as
another
stage
in
the
long
process,
it
is
where
I
begin
to
divide
my
own
ideas
from
the
words
of
others
that
inspired
my
thoughts.
It
was
not
until
college
that
all
the
lessons
I
had
been
taught
came
together
in
my
writing.
My
writing
style
prior
to
my
freshman
year
had
two
extremes:
on
one
hand
it
was
too-quick
to
arrive
at
the
point,
but
in
other
assignments
I
would
rely
heavily
on
descriptions
to
justify
and
frame
a
statement.
Looking
back
over
papers
and
essays
that
I
wrote,
I
cringe,
because
the
style
is
in
such
a
state
of
transition.
There
are
hints
in
my
earlier
writings
of
the
skills
that
I
would
later
refine
in
order
to
create
papers
that
were
both
analytical
and
descriptive,
reflective
and
critical,
while
still
remaining
on-topic
and
pertinent
to
the
assignment.
I
think
my
style
is
incredibly
eclectic,
with
hints
of
a
basic
structure
underlying
each
piece;
for
example
when
I
write
poetry,
my
first
impulse
is
to
devote
the
early
stanzas
to
vague
descriptions
that
slowly
narrow
in
towards
the
main
point.
In
situations
where
other
writers
would
begin
with
the
specific
and
move
out
towards
the
general,
I
take
the
opposite
approach;
the
best
comparison
I
can
make
to
my
favored
writing
style
is
painting.
I
like
to
begin
with
sweeping
strokes
of
color
across
the
canvas,
vague
lines
that
do
not
resemble
anything
upon
first
glance,
and
then
adding
layer
upon
layer
of
detail,
until
a
quick
glance
at
the
painting
is
all
that
is
needed
to
determine
what
is
happening.
Something
that
came
as
a
shock
to
me
in
terms
of
writing
at
the
college
level
was
the
degree
of
flexibility
with
assignments.
I
had
professors
who
would
outline
briefly
what
they
expected
to
see
in
a
particular
paper
or
essay,
but
who
did
not
give
any
type
of
clear
outline.
For
someone
who
was
still
very
conscious
of
knowing
what
the
audience
wanted
and
expected,
this
was
a
nerve-racking
experience.
Several
papers
that
I
have
written
in
the
past
three
years
were
the
result
of
long
hours
staring
at
the
hastily
scribbled
notes
I
had
made
in
class,
trying
to
determine
what
the
professor
wanted
me
to
write.
I
think
that
one
of
my
greatest
weaknesses
as
a
writer
is
trying
to
anticipate
what
my
audience,
and
often
times
what
my
professor,
expects
from
a
particular
assignment.
Instead
of
concentrating
on
bringing
my
own
unique
twist
to
a
particular
topic,
I
get
so
caught
up
in
trying
to
get
several
steps
ahead
of
the
assignment
that
I
end
up
creating
a
mediocre
reflection
essay.
During
the
revision
process
I
focus
more
on
bringing
more
of
my
own
voice
into
the
barren
structure
that
I
created
in
the
primary
draft.
Some
people
are
lucky
enough
to
create
pieces
of
writing
that
combine
their
personal
observations
together
into
a
neat
package
in
the
first
draft;
I
find
that
it
takes
me
several
drafts
to
iron
out
my
own
thoughts
on
a
particular
point
or
issue.
Instead
of
making
outlines
for
my
papers,
I
often
begin
by
making
a
list
of
quotations
that
I
found
particularly
powerful
or
applicable,
and
then
building
off
of
those
D
using
the
words
and
ideas
of
others
to
spur
my
own
thoughts.
Some
of
my
best
writing
comes
from
just
sitting
down
in
front
of
a
computer
and
doing
a
type
of
free-writing:
I
type
until
I
hit
a
wall
of
sorts
in
my
mind,
a
point
where
I
feel
like
everything
I
write
is
becoming
repetitive
of
an
earlier
point.
Once
I
hit
that
point
I
know
that
I
have
usually
laid
down
enough
of
a
structure
upon
which
to
begin
the
brutal
revision
process
that
my
writing
undergoes.
Looking
back
over
the
narrative
I
have
constructed,
I
think
that
I
have
made
many
valuable
detours
but
arrived
back
at
the
same
viewpoint
I
began
from.
Writing
for
me
is
not
a
job
or
a
daunting
task;
it
is
something
that
feels
so
familiar
and
natural;
reading
over
old
journal
entries
or
papers
gives
me
the
same
sense
of
nostalgia
that
looking
at
a
framed
photograph
brings
up.
Although
my
voice
has
become
clearer,
my
structure
less
rigid,
and
my
mind
more
open
to
challenges
and
creative
outlets,
I
still
remember
the
thrill
that
I
got
the
first
time
I
wrote
my
name.
