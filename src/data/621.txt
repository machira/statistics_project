Discovery
Before
I
loved
writing,
I
loved
reading.
When
my
mother
called
me
to
the
kitchen
for
dinner,
I
was
the
child
a
parent
would
find
absorbed
in
the
whimsical
words
of
E.B.
WhiteOs
CharlotteOs
Web
or
the
heartfelt
tale
of
Wilson
RawlsOs
Where
the
Red
Fern
Grows.
I
delighted
in
my
hobby
that
could
occupy
my
hours
of
boredom.
Books
were
my
addiction
before
I
knew
the
meaning
of
the
word
and
could
apply
its
definition
beyond
the
literal
one
provided
in
the
dictionary.
I
allowed
myself
bragging
rights
based
on
how
rapidly
my
mind
and
soul
could
devour
the
masterpieces
of
childrenOs
literature.
I
felt
empty
if
I
was
not
reading
a
book
and
my
despair
without
one
in
a
waiting
room
at
the
doctorOs
would
leave
me
fidgety
(these
were
the
days
before
I
could
read
analog
time
properly
and
before
I
had
a
reliable
watch).
Writing
was
merely
a
task
for
schoolwork.
Carefully
printing
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
allowed
me
to
write
short
creative
pieces
incorporating
the
words
I
had
learned
from
reading
book
after
book.
At
times,
I
was
compelled
to
include
new
vocabulary
words
in
order
to
instill
the
meaning
for
Friday
morning
Spelling
Tests
and
Vocabulary
Quizzes.
I
diligently
practiced
using
words
such
as
NprecociousO
or
NintricateO
(though
I
failed
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
NwedlockO
until
well
past
my
elementary
school
years)
in
the
hopes
that
I
could
move
on
to
reading
longer
and
more
difficult
books
that
did
not
require
illustrations
to
clarify
how
my
imagination
should
construct
the
actions
of
the
plot.
I
never
wrote
without
an
assignment
from
a
teacher
because
it
never
really
occurred
to
me
to
sit
down
at
the
kitchen
table
in
my
house
and
write
what
I
was
thinking.
My
grade
school
years
were
mostly
focused
on
reading
book
after
book
whenever
my
schoolwork
did
not
keep
me
preoccupied
with
mathematics
or
dreadful
brain
teasers
or
logic
games.
In
the
third
grade,
my
teacher
decided
that
we
were
old
enough
to
read
the
Diary
of
Anne
Frank.
Old
enough
to
pronounce
the
words
were
certainly
were,
but
we
were
not
competent
enough
to
begin
to
fathom
the
horrors
of
her
experiences.
We
certainly
were
not
even
ready
to
appreciate
her
talent
for
expressing
her
thoughts
with
such
painful
beauty.
Although
my
memories
of
childhood
are
faded,
I
am
grateful
that
I
still
can
glimpse
into
my
past
and
still
picture
myself
listening
to
my
teacher
read
AnneOs
words.
Whatever
Anne
meant
to
tell
or
not
tell
the
world,
I
felt
stirred
somehow
and
I
wanted
to
be
able
to
write
beautiful
lyrical
phrases
because
then
someone
might
think
the
same
of
my
own
writing.
It
was
the
first
time
I
had
ever
thought
about
writing
because
I
wanted
to
create
something
or
write
about
how
I
felt.
I
tried
writing
in
a
diary
given
to
me
as
a
birthday
present,
but
I
gave
up
the
formidable
task
of
keeping
daily
entries.
Shortly
thereafter,
Harry
Potter
mania
took
over
and
I
was
once
again
hooked
on
reading
book
after
book.
My
first
flight
as
a
writer
taking
initiative
outside
of
the
classroom
went
NpoofO
from
my
forebrain
and
was
buried
by
the
new
delightful
adventures
crafted
by
J.K.
Rowling.
Taking
on
the
role
of
the
avid
reader
is
much
easier
than
taking
on
the
role
of
the
avid
writer.
Not
until
the
sixth
grade
did
I
have
a
teacher
who
encouraged
me
to
examine
my
skills
as
a
writer
more
closely
rather
than
dismissing
the
NartO
as
merely
a
way
to
further
education.
At
the
end
of
the
year,
the
sixth
grade
classes
were
all
assigned
to
assemble
a
portfolio
of
the
writing
we
had
completed
over
the
year.
However,
not
only
did
we
have
to
carefully
select
writing
pieces,
we
had
to
reflect
on
why
we
would
choose
to
preserve
our
works.
As
a
twelve
year
old,
it
was
the
first
time
I
ever
needed
to
examine
myself
and
what
I
wrote
and
decide
why
some
of
what
I
had
written
was
a
little
stronger
than
some
others.
As
a
studious
individual,
I
never
was
one
to
take
an
assignment
as
serious
as
this
lightly.
At
the
time
I
consumed
myself
in
this
decision
process,
I
ended
up
choosing
pieces
that
I
liked
rather
than
contemplating
what
the
individual
pieces
revealed
about
my
tendencies
as
writer
or
even
as
a
person.
Only
now
in
hindsight
can
I
surmise
that
my
teacher
effectively
forced
us
to
create
a
time
capsule
of
our
writing.
And
so,
when
I
look
back
on
my
sixth
grade
portfolio
not
only
do
I
see
the
roots
of
my
writing
style,
but
I
hear
the
voice
of
my
past
self
give
light
to
the
parts
of
me
that
I
have
carried
with
me
since
the
time
I
penned
those
words.
I
was
more
convinced
in
the
merit
of
writing
reflections
about
my
character
as
well
as
my
academic
work
at
the
end
of
the
eighth
grade.
My
teacher
assigned
my
class
to
write
letters
to
ourselves
that
she
would
mail
to
us
once
we
graduated
high
school.
I
thought
this
assignment
was
much
more
appealing
as
I
would
not
receive
a
grade
for
the
words
I
chose
to
leave
for
myself
to
read
four
years
in
the
future.
Not
until
high
school
did
I
begin
to
take
myself
more
seriously
as
a
writer.
For
my
first
two
years,
I
had
the
same
English
teacher
guide
me
through
an
invaluable
transformation
in
my
writing
style
and
my
approach
to
intellectual
thought.
Rather
than
having
a
curriculum
balanced
between
creative
and
academic
writing,
the
latter
dominated
the
classroom.
In
my
first
year
of
high
school,
I
began
to
accept
that
writing
about
literature
I
did
not
necessarily
love
or
agree
with
did
not
mean
I
could
not
write
an
effective
expository
essay.
In
fact,
sometimes
my
NhatredO
for
a
book
(i.e.
Ethan
Frome)
actually
allowed
me
tap
into
crafting
more
foreboding
and
formidable
arguments
because
I
had
to
force
myself
to
find
quality
evidence
to
argue
something
in
favor
of
the
work.
Unconsciously,
this
approach
towards
writing
taught
me
to
gain
a
greater
appreciation
for
authors
whose
line
of
work
is
a
maze
of
rich
language
of
premeditated
creation.
I
found
myself
unprepared
for
one
assignment
entitled
NLife
Experiment.O
This
particular
NingeniousO
invention
of
my
English
teacher
required
everyone
to
experiment
with
their
life
by
trying
to
change
something
for
a
period
of
two
weeks.
Baffled
beyond
belief,
I
couldnOt
understand
how
anyone
could
keep
up
that
commitment
and
then
write
an
evaluate
commentary
on
personal
performance
in
accordance
with
the
goals
and
rules
set
for
oneOs
self.
My
reaction
was,
more
or
less,
a
defense
mechanism
to
express
annoyance
at
the
prospect
of
judging
myself
more
closely
than
I
would
have
to
normally.
My
cynicism
burned
to
the
ground
as
I
took
care
trying
to
improve
my
lifestyle
and
by
the
time
I
sat
down
to
the
computer
to
write
my
essay,
I
realized
that
the
ambition
to
achieve
self-improvement
is
an
admirable
lifelong
goal
to
not
only
broaden
oneOs
perspective
on
life,
but
to
discover
new
pathways
to
solve
the
problems
of
the
world.
Through
that
assignment
I
acquired
a
greater
sense
of
the
kind
of
person
I
wanted
to
aspire
to
become
and
I
channeled
these
findings
into
my
writing.
As
I
was
growing
as
a
person,
I
could
not
help
but
alter
my
writing
style
and
analyze
literature
with
a
greater
sense
of
personal
involvement
in
the
stories,
characters,
and
themes.
I
entered
my
second
year
of
high
school
excited
to
have
the
same
teacher
for
English
as
the
year
before.
Compared
to
the
students
who
had
never
encountered
this
teacher
in
a
classroom
setting,
I
was
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
and
barely
sweating
when
the
first
assignment
came
around.
BAM!
I
suffered
from
egotistical
whiplash
upon
receiving
more
negative
criticism
on
my
first
assignment
and
receiving
a
less
than
perfect
A
grade
that
I
would
normally
expect.
As
per
classroom
policy,
I
revised
the
essay
and
the
changes
earned
me
an
A.
However,
I
kept
falling
into
this
pattern
of
mandated
revision
and
I
found
myself
frustrated
whenever
I
had
to
write
and
writing
under
pressure
made
me
suffer
from
writerOs
block
which
in
turn
deteriorated
the
quality
of
the
crisp
and
fluid
writing
I
knew
I
could
produce.
As
time
went
on,
the
fog
surrounding
me
only
thickened
as
each
piece
I
wrote
received
less
and
less
criticism,
and
the
amount
of
surgery
required
increased.
For
the
first
time,
I
found
my
frustration
preventing
my
enjoyment
of
reading
as
I
ended
up
throwing
down
book
after
book
in
disgust
at
a
loss
for
what
subject
of
argumentation
might
succeed
in
completing
each
assignment.
My
teacher
simply
told
me
that
I
would
have
to
figure
out
how
to
fix
my
writing
without
his
help,
a
truly
terrifying
task
without
any
clue
what
direction
to
head
in.
I
finally
had
to
admit
to
myself,
I
had
grown
complacent
and
I
had
failed
to
apply
the
lesson
of
Nself-improvementO
with
my
approach
to
the
class.
Frozen
in
place,
I
needed
to
devise
a
plan
of
attack
for
my
thesis
on
Ken
KeseyOs
One
Flew
Over
the
CuckooOs
Nest.
My
mind
could
not
function
out
of
terror
that
my
work
might
appear
imperfect
and
ugly
without
my
trademark
portions
of
lyrical
prose.
Eventually,
I
gave
up
trying
to
formulate
sentences
that
might
match
the
great
authors
of
famous
books.
I
tackled
the
thesis
with
a
more
textual
touch
to
reflect
a
more
academic
tone.
When
I
let
myself
go
of
my
performance
from
the
year
before
and
did
not
force
flowery
language,
I
found
myself
finally
tapping
into
the
energy
of
thought
that
my
teacher
could
not
simply
pass
onto
me
in
words.
I
needed
to
struggle
in
order
to
find
out
that
to
become
a
better
writer,
I
needed
to
approach
every
assignment
with
a
different
state
of
mind.
By
discovering
this,
the
high
compliments
I
received
for
my
thesis
mattered
more
after
having
to
struggle
to
find
my
new
level
of
writing
performance.
Though
I
was
told
the
paper
was
on
the
level
of
an
AP
English
student,
I
did
not
let
such
high
praise
expand
my
ego
too
much.
Attaining
higher
and
higher
levels
of
achievement
meant
I
could
not
stop.
I
owe
a
lot
of
my
successes
in
my
academic
writing
to
the
unmitigated
mentoring
from
this
teacher.
After
writing
my
thesis,
my
teacher
gave
us
a
break
and
decided
to
shift
gears
and
allow
us
to
write
a
creative
piece
of
our
choosing.
The
short
story
I
wrote
encompassed
a
sorrowful
love
story
and
was
structured
in
fragments
and
flashbacks
from
a
first
person
point
of
view.
Though
the
piece
stood
well
at
the
time
of
its
first
draft
three
and
a
half
years
ago,
I
can
see
now
that
the
story
itself
is
incomplete
(and
still
without
a
title)
because
I
have
not
experienced
enough
to
give
the
story
life
beyond
the
lyrical
prose
that
supports
it.
I
find
this
work
of
mine
important
because
at
the
time
of
its
first
draft,
I
felt
amazed
that
I
could
garner
enough
focus
to
even
have
a
respectable
piece.
Today,
I
look
at
the
story
and
I
am
amazed
that
allowing
time
to
pass
before
returning
to
a
piece
can
help
find
the
way
to
finish
the
piece.
A
writerOs
work
never
really
ends
and
so
I
look
upon
this
story
as
a
reminder
to
myself
that
if
I
am
mired
in
the
mud
over
a
creative
work,
letting
it
sit
idle
for
an
indeterminable
amount
of
time
will
allow
for
my
frustration
to
evaporate
and
I
can
start
again
anew.
Though
this
piece
received
high
praise
at
the
time
it
was
first
written,
I
can
see
its
weaknesses
now
and
know
that
it
cannot
remain
as
it
is
if
I
am
to
ever
present
it
to
a
much
larger
audience.
I
rarely
ever
allow
anyone
to
read
my
creative
pieces
until
they
are
finished
because
input
on
a
piece
before
its
completion
influences
me
and
takes
my
stories
in
a
different
direction
than
I
planned
on;
often,
I
become
lost
between
my
thoughts
and
criticisms
and
cannot
find
a
way
back.
Though
I
will
grudgingly
allow
my
family
to
read
pieces
I
have
written,
I
never
quite
feel
as
though
they
completely
understand
the
heart
of
the
pieces.
They
compliment
me
because
they
want
to
encourage
me.
As
a
writer
you
are
alone
because
no
one
can
tell
your
mind
what
to
think
and
thinking
beyond
what
others
might
stumble
upon
is
dangerous.
I
do
not
understand
the
creative
process,
but
it
seems
as
though
struggle
is
an
integral
part
of
its
operation.
Building
upon
the
lessons
from
the
year
before,
I
began
keeping
a
journal
for
the
latter
half
of
my
high
school
career.
Unlike
my
first
attempt
in
the
third
grade,
I
found
myself
committed
to
keeping
a
daily
record
of
my
thoughts,
feelings,
actions,
and
events
in
my
life.
But
more
importantly,
I
wanted
a
written
record
to
preserve
my
memory
of
myself
as
I
am
in
that
exact
moment.
A
little
more
than
two
years
later,
I
still
keep
writing
in
journals
and
I
have
made
this
conclusion:
the
hardest
topic
to
write
about
is
yourself
because
we
fear
finding
faults
in
ourselves
we
might
not
otherwise
acknowledge.
So,
when
I
reflect
about
how
I
behaved
in
certain
situations,
I
often
do
not
approve
of
my
character
and
actions.
I
am
learning
that
my
writing
is
more
powerful
when
I
am
honest
with
myself,
but
the
cathartic
experience
is
also
painful
at
times.
Transitioning
from
high
school
to
college
brought
a
set
of
new
challenges
to
face
in
order
to
grow
as
a
writer.
I
knew
that
college
writing
required
a
more
critical
approach
towards
writing
and
I
proceeded
cautiously
afraid
that
what
I
might
write
would
not
appear
to
reveal
anything
insightful
and
less
than
obvious.
Receiving
my
first
written
assignments
terrified
me
and
I
did
not
feel
prepared
to
jump
into
untested
waters.
In
order
to
complete
these
assignments,
I
had
to
let
go
of
my
fear
because
it
is
fear
that
paralyzes
me
and
inhibits
my
writing.
One
of
the
challenges
I
faced
occurred
during
My
First
Year
Seminar.
My
classmates
and
I
had
to
write
academic
and
creative
narratives
about
historical
people
from
the
Easton
area.
We
read
different
academic
narratives
and
creative
narratives
to
prepare
ourselves
for
the
assignment
so
we
could
build
upon
the
prior
examples
of
authors
completing
the
same
tasks,
though
on
a
much
larger
scale.
Writing
my
academic
narrative
on
James
P.
Boyd
(a
student
at
Lafayette
during
the
1840s)
left
me
puzzled.
I
outlined
my
sources
and
tried
piecing
together
fragments
of
a
paper
and
nothing
was
working.
I
followed
my
professors
advice,
attended
my
WA
meetings,
and
when
it
came
time
to
handing
in
the
paper
I
was
uncertain
of
how
my
work
would
be
received.
To
make
a
long
story
short,
my
professor
requested
I
revise
the
paper
for
a
higher
grade.
I
went
for
a
walk
racking
my
brain
on
how
to
fix
this
paper.
I
went
back
to
my
room
and
sat
at
my
desk
and
printed
out
my
paper
and
sat
there
adding
a
transition
here
or
there,
but
lacking
any
tangible
correction
that
would
suddenly
lead
me
to
the
ever
wonderful
and
ever
rare
epiphany
that
would
solve
everything.
I
scanned
my
books
and
pulled
out
the
biography
on
Abigail
Adams
and
began
reading
certain
sections
out
of
order.
And
then,
I
realized
that
was
what
I
was
missingEmy
paragraphs
were
out
of
order
instead
of
in
order.
My
paper
was
much
too
jumpy
between
paragraphs
and
didnOt
have
transitions
that
were
clear
enough
to
the
reader.
After
corrections,
I
received
a
higher
grade
but
more
importantly
I
gained
further
insight
into
the
difficulties
that
face
a
writerEa
writer
must
always
reverse
their
role
and
read
their
work
as
if
they
have
never
read
the
black
printed
letters.
We
all
have
our
own
histories
to
share
with
others,
but
to
be
a
writer
you
have
to
be
committed
not
only
to
discovering
yourself
and
the
world,
but
to
engaging
the
reader.
So,
there
is
my
love
for
reading
and
my
love
for
writing.
My
love
for
writing
allows
me
to
tell
my
stories
(whatever
challenges
might
appear)
and
the
stories
of
other
places
and
people
either
real
or
fiction.
But,
my
love
for
reading
will
always
let
me
seek
solace
in
the
great
writers
of
the
world
who,
like
me,
seek
counsel
for
the
creative
struggles
bound
to
come
forth.
