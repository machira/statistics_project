All
of
the
kids
lined
up
at
the
door
in
their
not-so-straight
line,
several
holding
balls
or
jump
ropes,
thrilled
that
10:30
had
finally
come.
After
all,
10:30
meant
only
one
thingErecess.
And,
like
any
other
typical
kindergarten
class,
recess
was
the
best
part
of
the
day.
(Well,
except
for
maybe
Thursdays,
when
snack
time
consisted
of
chocolate
chip
cookies
and
chocolate
milk.)
As
23
children
filed
out
the
front
door,
I
sat
in
the
back
at
my
desk
and
just
watched
them
go.
Then,
happily,
I
turned
back
to
the
newest
book
I
was
creating
and
continued
to
add
illustrations
to
my
writing.
As
a
child,
I
had
a
love
for
reading
and
writing.
So
much,
in
fact,
that
I
would
occasionally
skip
recess
to
write.
The
teacher
knew
that
I
was
bored
during
the
day,
so
she
set
up
a
small
work
station
in
the
corner
of
the
room
with
a
desk
and
plenty
of
paper
and
markers
that
my
little
mind
or
hands
could
ever
want
or
need.
Each
new
storybook
I
created
resulted
in
rounds
of
praise
from
my
parents
and
my
teachers.
I
was
achieving
something
that
none
of
my
peers
came
close
to,
and
I
was
proud
of
my
work.
And
thus,
my
love
of
writing
began.
Or
was
it
my
love
for
praise?
As
a
kindergartener,
I
wasnOt
sure,
nor
did
I
care.
Elementary
school
continued,
I
continued
to
read
and
write,
and
my
love
for
both
grew
steadily.
Much
of
the
writing
we
were
assigned
was
either
creative
pieces
or
book
reports.
Both
allowed
me
to
be
creative,
either
in
my
writing
or
in
the
book
I
chose
to
write
about.
The
positive
feedback
continued.
And,
unlike
the
math
worksheets
and
spelling
tests
that
consumed
the
majority
of
my
elementary
school
days,
writing
put
no
limits
on
where
my
thoughts
or
ideas
could
travel.
I
spent
quite
a
bit
of
my
time
at
home
reading
or
writing
as
well,
keeping
a
diary,
writing
Nchapter
books,O
and
attempting
poetry
on
occasion.
As
a
child,
I
aspired
to
be
either
a
teacher,
and
doctor,
or
a
writer
when
I
grew
up.
In
middle
school,
I
was
introduced
to
several
different
kinds
of
writing
and
literature.
Poetry,
persuasive
essays,
research
papers,
and
informative
essays
were
all
introduced
and
attempted
during
those
years.
However,
the
more
writing
I
was
assigned
in
school,
the
less
I
enjoyed
it.
I
no
longer
had
the
freedom
to
Ncreate;O
I
was
now
writing
to
please
-
both
my
teachers
and
my
parents.
And,
the
more
writing
I
was
assigned
at
school,
the
less
I
wanted
to
write
in
my
free
time,
regardless
of
how
creative
I
could
be.
It
was
in
middle
school
that
I
began
developing
my
fail-proof
writing
method
for
receiving
praise
and
high
grades.
I
could
create
a
captivating
title
and
the
NcatchyO
opening
sentence,
and
my
handle
on
the
English
language
gave
my
writing
a
professional
flair.
I
knew
how
to
structure
my
writing
into
a
well-organized
paper,
something
that
my
teachers
applauded,
and
I
had
the
ability
to
come
up
with
that
cheesy
conclusion
that
left
all
of
my
teachers
smiling
and
impressed.
Comments
like,
Nwhat
a
great
paper,
so
professional!O
and
Nbeautifully
written,
A+!O
boosted
my
self-esteem,
but
never
helped
my
writing.
I
didnOt
have
to
work
at
it.
Because
I
never
struggled
with
my
writing,
I
never
got
any
better.
I
entered
high
school,
loading
up
on
honors
and
advanced
placement
classes.
My
Honors
English
class
contained
a
lot
of
reading
and
even
more
discussion
and
writing
than
I
was
used
to.
With
higher
teacher
expectations,
I
was
terrified
yet
enthusiastic
about
this
new
challenge.
That
particular
year
we
did
a
lot
in
the
form
of
role-playing.
This
included
acting,
speeches
as
delivered
by
a
famous
person,
or
adapting
to
and
writing
as
a
character
from
Animal
Farm.
This
was
extremely
challenging,
because
I
was
not
used
to
stepping
outside
the
boundaries
of
my
NprofessionalO
style.
However,
these
assignments
proved
very
rewarding
and
beneficial,
as
they
forced
me
to
adapt
to
a
different
style
of
writing
altogether.
However,
the
moment
the
role-playing
stopped,
so
did
the
enjoyment
of
writing,
and
soon
I
was
back
to
writing
informative
essays
and
research
papers.
At
some
point
during
my
high
school
years,
I
tried
my
hand
at
writing
song
lyrics.
I
loved
music,
and
I
at
times
I
loved
to
write,
what
better
two
things
to
combine?
After
writing
one
or
two
songs,
though,
I
gave
up.
I
didnOt
know
what
to
write
about,
and
even
if
I
did,
I
didnOt
know
how
to
express
it
without
using
the
methodical
and
professional
language
that
I
was
used
to.
After
all,
I
doubted
that
a
song
titled
NThe
Initial
Occasion
when
I
Observed
You,O
or
any
song
that
didnOt
have
an
normal
feel
to
it,
would
make
the
Billboards
Weekly
Top
40.
The
following
year,
in
my
10th
grade
Honors
class,
I
got
the
wake
up
call
of
my
writing
life.
I
received
my
first
C
on
a
paper
I
wrote.
Now,
I
had
spent
quite
a
bit
of
time
on
a
particular
paper.
Well,
I
had
spent
quite
a
bit
of
time
on
it
that
previous
night.
I
handed
it
in,
assuming
that
it
was
a
decent
paper,
worthy
of
nothing
less
than
an
A-.
I
was
in
for
a
surprise.
When
I
got
the
paper
back,
it
was
covered
from
top
to
bottom
with
the
dreaded
markings
of
the
red
pen.
That
teacher
was
known
for
her
sharp
criticism
and
her
deathly
red
pen.
I
had
fallen
victim
to
it.
Covered
with
comments,
both
good
and
bad,
I
could
barely
get
through
page
3
before
I
needed
to
take
a
break.
I
couldnOt
handle
the
constructive
criticism
of
the
writing
I
always
thought
was
so
absolutely
fantastic.
Thankfully
for
me,
this
teacher
had
seen
right
through
my
structured
writing
with
my
clichd
ideas
and
conclusions.
The
plethora
of
advanced
and
misused
vocabulary
words
did
not
impress
her
in
the
least.
I
was
heartbroken.
But
when
I
actually
read
through
the
comments
again,
this
time
with
an
open
mind
and
a
desire
to
learn,
I
realized
that
this
particular
writing
experience
was
possibly
the
best
I
had
ever
had.
That
particular
year,
I
learned
that
my
clich
writing
wouldnOt
cut
it,
especially
when
I
got
to
college.
I
needed
to
be
an
informed
reader
and
writer,
backing
up
my
claims
with
solid
arguments
and
support.
My
teacher
knew
that
I
had
potential
as
a
writer,
she
was
not
about
to
let
me
slide
without
effort
as
other
teachers
had
done
in
the
past.
The
English
program
at
my
high
school
proved
very
effective,
as
we
read
and
discussed
a
wide
array
of
literature.
Reading
exceptional
and
not-so-exceptional
writing
helped
me
discern
what
my
own
writing
was
lacking.
And,
a
variety
of
writing
assignments
in
my
junior
and
senior
years,
ranging
from
research
to
journalism
to
satire,
changed
my
perception
of
writing.
This
variety
allowed
me
to
explore
my
own
creativity;
it
gave
me
the
freedom
to
write
in
styles
that
I
enjoyed,
and
forced
me
to
adapt
to
styles
that
I
didnOt
particularly
care
for.
Senior
year
of
high
school
rolled
around,
and
the
time
had
come
to
send
out
college
applications.
Of
course,
no
college
required
that
you
select
a
major,
in
fact,
some
recommended
that
you
come
to
college
undecided.
But
I
couldnOt
bear
leaving
high
school
without
a
plan.
Academically,
I
excelled
at
everything,
but
had
little
passion
for
anything
in
the
academic
world.
I
wanted
to
act,
to
sing,
or
to
be
a
news
anchor
one
day,
but
all
of
those
were
Nsilly
and
unreasonable
hopes,O
in
my
mind.
And
so,
I
chose
to
major
in
English,
not
because
I
had
any
passion
for
it,
but
because
I
was
good
at
it,
and
I
still
received
praise
from
my
teachers.
Besides,
it
was
one
of
the
few
subjects
that
allowed
some
creativity,
unlike
the
rest
of
my
math,
science,
and
history
classes.
Even
still,
specified
topics
and
detailed
structure
on
how
to
write
put
a
damper
on
my
love
for
writing.
I
had
the
structure
of
what
a
Ngood
paperO
should
look
like
down
to
a
science.
But
there
was
no
passion.
My
own
writing
barely
held
my
own
interest;
how
could
it
interest
anybody
else?
I
was
excited
nonetheless.
High
school
had
prepared
me
with
structural
and
grammatical
knowledge.
I
could
produce
a
well-organized,
structurally
sound
and
professional
sounding
paper
with
few
mechanical
errors.
It
was
now
time
to
develop
a
style
of
my
own.
I
entered
my
First
Year
Seminar
class
with
high
expectations.
Without
having
the
High
School
summer
reading
and
writing
assignments
that
I
was
used
to,
I
was
eager
to
begin
writing
once
again.
And
with
our
first
assignment,
I
launched
right
back
into
my
professional
and
informative
style.
It
didnOt
go
over
well
with
the
professor.
Several
papers,
conferences,
tears,
and
months
later,
FYS
ended,
and
I
had
emerged
with
three
valuable
lessons
on
writing:
#1.
Importance
of
multiple
drafts.
I
had
been
accustomed
to
writing
my
first
draft
of
a
paper
(occasionally
after
making
a
quick
outline),
checking
for
mechanical
and
grammatical
errors,
and
handing
that
paper
in
the
following
day
as
Nmy
best
work.O
I
assumed
that
the
best
I
had
to
say
I
could
say
in
my
first
draft.
Why
take
up
any
more
time
in
writing
multiple
drafts
if
I
could
say
all
that
I
wanted
the
first
time?
To
me,
this
was
efficiency.
To
my
professor,
this
was
irrational
and
a
waste
of
talent.
After
assigning
a
paper,
she
would
demand
the
first
draft
(of
many)
by
a
certain
date,
and
the
final
paper
a
week
later.
This
allowed
me
to
step
away
from
my
writing
for
a
few
days,
then
return
to
it
with
a
fresh
perspective.
It
transformed
my
work.
With
every
new
draft,
I
was
able
to
clarify,
expand,
and
delete
from
my
paper,
making
it
more
solid
and
polished.
#2.
Importance
of
peer
editing.
I
used
to
hate
when
teachers
assigned
Npeer
editing
days.O
I
always
handed
my
paper
to
someone
else,
and
when
it
was
returned
to
me,
it
provided
little
help.
Every
once
in
a
while,
I
received
a
comment
such
as,
NYou
are
missing
a
comma
here,O
or
NYou
may
want
to
check
the
spelling
of
that
word.O
I
didnOt
see
the
benefit
of
having
others
critique
my
work
when
it
provided
me
with
little
to
no
direction
for
future
drafts.
However,
for
one
particular
paper,
I
went
to
a
friend
outside
my
FYS
class.
The
paper
came
back
with
a
significant
amount
of
red
ink
covering
the
front.
The
paper
I
viewed
as
my
Nbest
work,O
my
friend
viewed
as
an
unclear
and
weak
argument.
As
the
writer,
I
automatically
know
what
I
am
trying
to
say,
regardless
if
it
is
well
articulated.
The
same
is
not
true
for
the
reader.
The
only
way
they
can
understand
me
or
my
writing
is
through
what
they
see
on
the
paper.
And,
even
though
we
as
writers
may
understand
our
own
writing,
most
of
what
we
write
must
be
for
others
rather
than
for
ourselves.
Too
often,
that
purpose
is
reversed.
#3.
Importance
of
discovery.
Who
wants
to
write
a
paper
that
could
have
been
copied
out
a
textbook?
I
certainly
didnOt.
Yet
paper
after
paper
proved
that
this
is
exactly
what
I
had
been
doing.
In
my
high
school
years,
I
had
been
taught
how
to
summarize,
analyze,
and
organize.
The
majority
of
my
writing
was
uninteresting
and
unoriginal.
Anyone
could
have
come
up
with
the
same
piece
of
writing.
During
my
semester
of
FYS,
I
learned
that
originality
in
writing
came
from
discovery.
This
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
each
paper
needed
to
contain
a
new
scientific
formula,
unveil
the
cure
for
AIDS,
or
reveal
some
deep
dark
secret
in
a
political
figureOs
past.
Although
this
originality
certainly
includes
these
discoveries,
it
is
not
limited
to
these
types.
Originality
could
mean
presenting
old
information
in
a
new
way,
comparing
two
unlikely
topics,
or
applying
two
unrelated
texts
to
each
other
and
drawing
conclusions
from
that
application.
These
three
NlessonsO
from
my
FYS
class
gave
me
a
much
stronger
foundation
for
my
writing
technique.
But
I
knew
I
still
had
a
great
deal
to
learn.
English
110
class
proved
equally
beneficial.
With
a
topic
of
originality
and
convention,
I
knew
that
although
much
of
the
information
would
be
repetitive
given
my
background.
However,
I
knew
that
my
openness
and
my
attitude
to
the
class
would
have
a
significant
impact
on
my
writing
improvement
during
the
semester.
That
particular
semester
produced
some
of
my
most
enjoyable
writing.
Once
I
learned
that
a
college-level
paper
did
not
necessarily
mean
Nprofessional-styleO
writing,
there
was
no
end
to
directions
I
could
take
for
any
given
piece.
I
explored
different
forms
of
originality
and
style
through
the
readings;
later
I
was
given
the
chance
to
practice
and
develop
many
of
them.
The
material
and
assignments
helped
deepen
my
appreciation
and
enjoyment
for
writing
by
opening
up
my
eyes
to
the
possibilities
it
offered.
A
wise
professor
from
Lafayette
once
told
me
NTo
write
is
to
participate
in
one
of
lifeOs
most
intellectually
challenging
processes.
IOve
been
writing
for
years,
and
itOs
harder
now
than
when
I
first
began.O
Maybe
itOs
realizing
what
great
writing
truly
is
that
makes
writing
even
more
difficult.
This
has
certainly
been
true
of
my
college
writing
experience
thus
far.
The
hardest
part
is
sitting
down
in
front
of
my
computer
and
simply
beginning.
The
more
skills
I
develop
as
a
writer,
the
less
I
am
satisfied
with
my
own
writing,
because
I
realize
the
potential
of
each
piece.
And
until
I
can
write
at
my
highest
level
of
potential,
I
must
simply
accept
that
I
have
a
lot
to
learn,
and
start
learning
itEone
word
at
a
time.
