A
History
of
Writing
An
attempt
to
record
the
development
of
my
writing
feels
very
likely
to
sound
like
a
travel
log.
The
reason
is
because
I
have
traveled
to
various
places
in
search
of
an
education
and
in
each
of
these
I
have
come
across
varying
ways
of
writing.
My
memories
of
writing
feel
closely
knit
to
my
memories
of
the
new
countries
and
cultures
I
have
found
myself
in.
And
yet
a
division
of
the
two
is
necessary,
hard
but
necessary,
if
I
am
to
understand
how
far
along
I
have
come
as
a
writer,
and
how
much
further
I
have
to
go.
My
earliest
writing
experiences
are
easy
to
conjure
up.
They
happened
between
the
ages
of
five
and
14,
in
primary
school
at
home
in
Kenya.
Being
in
an
upwardly
mobile
school,
that
boasted
of
speaking
an
English
close
to
that
of
the
QueenOs
it
was
of
the
utmost
necessity
to
ensure
that
English,
my
third
language,
progressed
at
a
rate
faster
than
that
of
Swahili,
my
second
language.
Everybody
forgot
to
teach
me
how
to
write
in
my
first
one,
or
rather
not
forget,
more
like
ignore
since
it
was
a
OnativeO
tongue,
a
language
that
Ohad
no
historyO.
Already
English
was
taking
on
the
shape
of
an
oppressor.
Compositions
in
primary
school
were
marked
for
vocabulary.
It
was
all
well
and
good
that
your
story
had
an
interesting
plot,
but
you
were
not
a
writer,
you
were
meant
to
be
just
but
a
student.
The
best
way
to
be
a
good
student
was
by
spewing
out
yard
after
yard
of
memorized
English
phrases
and
colloquial
expressions.
These
were
forced
into
our
writing
as
a
mark
of
excellence,
the
more
the
better.
The
teachers
forgot
to
tell
us
that
we
were
meant
to
be
writing
for
the
average
person
out
there
in
the
streets.
They
forgot
to
say
that
writing
was
intended
to
be
a
representation
of
Kenyan
culture
not
British.
My
early
writing
was
shaped
by
another
big
force:
my
hunger
for
books.
I
devoured
the
Ladybird
Reader
Series
for
kids,
I
raced
through
Famous
Five
and
Hardy
Boys.
Comics
such
as
TinTin
and
Asterix,
I
would
have
given
and
arm
and
a
leg
for
a
chance
to
read.
Such
wide
reading
exposed
me
to
very
different
ways
of
writing;
from
narrative
detective
stories
to
witty
comic
strips.
Due
to
this
I
was
able
to
begin
experimenting
with
forms
that
had
net
yet
been
introduced
in
school.
Some
experiments,
like
all
others,
ended
in
disasters,
Oyour
writing
has
taken
on
the
appearance
of
newspaper
cartoons!O
I
found
it
useful
all
the
same,
to
break
traditions
and
follow
the
proverbial
fork
on
the
path.
The
major
part
of
my
writing
has
been
done
on
pen
and
paper.
Right
through
high
school,
the
materials
I
got
when
expected
to
produce
something
worth
writing
were
simple.
The
complexity
in
material
came
along
when
I
moved
to
Singapore
for
my
International
Baccalaureate
Diploma.
I
had
to
produce
longer
works
and
the
computer/
word
processor
was
the
medium
to
do
it
in;
the
shift
was
interesting.
I
remember
that
initially,
I
would
draft
my
papers
in
pen
and
then
type
them
up
on
the
computer.
The
writing
process
materialized
at
that
stage
in
my
life.
Before,
because
most
if
not
all
of
my
writing
was
done
under
examination
conditions,
the
steps
of
drafting,
writing,
editing
and
proofing
had
not
become
concrete.
This
changed
when
I
got
more
time
to
do
my
papers.
I
found
the
write-by-pen,
then
transplant
to
a
computer
technique
very
useful.
It
was
clear
to
me
that
I
was
creative
when
I
did
not
think
through
a
machine,
my
juices
oozed
then.
On
the
other
hand,
my
editing
skills
sharpened
when
I
collaborated
with
the
computer,
I
could
cut
and
paste
whole
sentences
and
thus
be
able
to
reorder
my
entire
work.
The
jump
between
a
first
and
second
draft
became
more
apparent,
and
with
this
realization
I
came
to
truly
acknowledge
the
need
to
set
some
time
between
the
first
draft
and
editing
stages
of
a
paper.
Writing
for
my
IB
diploma
was
so
different
from
anything
I
had
done
before.
Its
purpose
was
to
see
what
I
had
learnt
not
what
I
could
create,
a
stark
contrast
from
my
days
in
high
school.
The
creative
process
was
totally
overshadowed,
since
most
of
the
writing
involved
research
rather
than
fiction;
my
earlier
acquired
skills
of
spinning
a
long
tale
were
not
useful.
If
anything
they
tended
to
be
hindrance
to
the
kind
of
clear
and
straightforward
writing
that
was
expected
of
me.
That
the
very
same
skills
that
had
enabled
me
to
succeed
back
home
were
now
metamorphosing
into
a
disability
was
a
hard
fact
to
accept.
It
was
only
later
that
I
realized
the
distinction
that
is
necessary
in
writing.
I
came
to
acknowledge
the
separation
and
difference
between
an
argument
paper
and
an
opinion
one,
between
a
piece
of
fiction
and
a
paper
that
required
hard
facts
and
research.
It
has
been
a
constant
joy
writing
in
my
several
journals
so
far.
I
have
made
travel
logs
of
the
many
places
I
have
visited
either
for
pleasure
or
work.
These
journals
have
accommodated
both
my
creative
and
reflective
impulses.
I
find
it
relieving
at
the
end
of
a
hard
day
to
sit
down
and
write
away
my
worries,
excitements
or
wishes.
These
daily
essays
have
taken
on
a
life
of
themselves
and
they
aptly
reflect
my
mood
on
any
particular
day.
I
began
these
journals
on
my
own,
they
were
a
source
of
pride
to
know
that
I
had
managed
to
record
everything
that
had
gone
on
in
my
life
for
a
period
of
time,
say
the
last
two
years.
These
articles
are
private,
they
also
are
very
honest.
I
attempt
to
write
and
record
as
precisely
as
I
can
any
thoughts,
feelings,
ideas
etc.
Since
they
are
so
private,
I
have
been
able
to
try
out
many
different
styles
in
them.
One
of
the
things
I
have
tried
is
putting
photos
in
them.
I
have
found
that
the
travel
log
with
photos
in
it
was
a
lot
more
personal.
It
felt
a
lot
closer
to
the
truth
that
I
had
experienced
while
traveling
because
the
articles
engage
not
just
my
writing
faculties
but
also
my
visual
memory
every
time
I
review
them.
The
ability
to
find
words
that
aptly
describe
a
situation
I
was
in
has
however
suffered
as
I
used
more
and
more
photos.
The
photos
no
doubt
distracted
me
during
the
writing
stage
and
my
skills
were
hindered.
This
was
a
very
powerful
realization;
it
made
me
think
twice
whenever
I
wish
to
use
an
image
in
a
paper.
I
have
to
ask
myself
whether
I
would
be
distracted,
and
if
so,
would
it
be
in
a
way
that
enhances
my
understanding
of
the
paper
overall
or
would
it
hinder
my
understanding.
After
my
IB
diploma
I
felt
that
I
was
ready
for
college
writing.
For
me,
being
ready
meant
having
experienced
many
different
ways
and
styles
of
writing,
and
I
felt
that
I
had
achieved
this.
I
had
at
one
time
or
another
done
creative,
argumentative,
descriptive
and
even
opinionated
pieces
of
writing.
Once
in
college
though,
I
realized
that
I
lacked
a
crucial
bit
of
the
overall
writing
process:
the
ability
to
write
as
a
reader.
Or
at
least,
to
write
with
the
reader
constantly
in
mind.
Thus
far
I
had
been
taught
to
be
authoritative
in
my
writing,
I
was
lord
over
what
I
wrote
and
I
expected
anybody
reading
it
to
accept
what
I
said,
not
least
to
understand
it
all.
The
idea
of
writing
with
the
reader
in
mind
is
so
simple
it
evades
most
people.
It
involves
realizing
that
the
piece
of
writing
is
not
complete
once
the
writer
is
done
with
it.
Rather,
the
paper
is
complete
once
it
has
communicated
to
the
intended
audience
exactly,
or
at
least
the
majority
of
what
it
set
out
to
say.
As
a
high
school
writer
I
tended
to
write
in
a
vacuum,
without
any
goal
as
to
why
the
paper
had
to
be
written
in
a
particular
way
and
not
any
other.
The
fact
that
all
my
writing
was
handed
over
to
teachers
dulled
my
mind
to
the
fact
that
different
kinds
of
writing
are
needed
for
different
audiences
and
purposes.
The
idea
came
with
its
own
burdens
of
course.
Some
of
the
major
questions
that
I
asked
myself
about
it
were
for
example,
how
can
you
exactly
tell
how
much
a
person
knows
or
does
not
know
about
a
subject?
How
do
you
delicately
strike
the
balance
between
telling
the
story
right
and
not
over
telling?
What
is
the
best
mix
of
researched
facts
with
oneOs
own
ideas?
The
questions
have
not
necessarily
gone
away
yet,
but
they
definitely
seem
much
less
daunting.
Initially,
they
were
such
big
obstacles
that
I
was
nearly
unable
to
write,
each
sentence
was
followed
with
hours
of
review,
whether
it
achieved
the
above
qualities
and
how
better
to
say
it.
I
do
still
do
the
review,
and
do
still
try
to
improve
each
sentence,
but
now
I
at
least
have
learnt
not
to
do
that
at
the
expense
of
the
writing
itself.
After
all
what
is
the
use
of
having
so
many
ideas
about
writing
if
you
cannot
try
them
out?
My
best
experience
as
a
writer
so
far
has
been
organizing
and
writing
a
paper
for
my
Ethics
class.
I
was
provided
with
a
broad
topic:
the
Aswan
High
dam
in
Egypt.
From
this,
I
was
expected
to
provide
an
ethical
analysis
with
reasons
and
at
the
end
come
up
with
a
ruling
on
the
benefits
or
otherwise
of
the
dam
project.
The
best
part
for
me
was
the
initial
part
of
reading
wide,
I
checked
out
many
different
books
and
just
went
through
them
as
I
tried
to
get
as
much
info
on
the
topic
I
had
only
minimally
had
of
before.
The
conversion
of
these
raw
data
and
facts
into
an
analysis
that
could
fulfill
the
requirements
of
the
paper
was
fulfilling.
It
felt
good
to
be
able
to
sift
through
the
great
mass
of
information
and
decide
what
was
best
for
the
paper
wand
what
was
not.
Then
ordering
all
this
info
into
a
cohesive
piece
that
flowed
well
was
a
process
I
enjoyed
greatly.
I
really
came
to
understand
the
popular
belief
that
Oonce
a
writer
has
topic,
they
should
research
on
it,
get
lost
in
the
details,
then
come
out
the
other
end
with
something
they
can
make
sense
of.
Overall,
I
have
great
interest
in
writing,
and
I
think
that
this
interest
has
shielded
me
from
any
big
disappointments
I
would
otherwise
have
experienced
as
I
encounter
problems
while
writing.
I
take
upon
any
writing
act
as
a
challenge,
one
that
I
enjoy
and
hope
to
triumph
in
but
one
that
I
also
understand
has
many
aspects
to
that
sometimes
I
might
miss.
The
interest
I
have
developed
in
writing
enables
me
to
see
failures
in
their
true
light,
just
another
lesson
on
how
NOT
to
do
things.
They
never
cripple
me
so
bad
that
I
begin
to
wish
I
would
never
have
to
write
again
as
many
of
my
fellow
students
have
come
complaining
to
me.
I
feel
such
an
attitude
will
in
the
long
run
put
me
in
a
position
where
I
can
learn
to
be
a
better
writer.
My
history
as
a
writer
cannot
be
complete
without
a
mention
of
the
languages
I
communicate
in.
The
three
main
languages
I
speak,
write
or
think
in
have
each
shaped
my
writing
in
their
own
way,
and
the
precedence
of
a
particular
language
at
one
time
over
the
others
is
easily
reflected
on
my
writing.
My
first
language,
Kikuyu,
I
use
when
speaking
to
my
dad
and
grandparents
in
my
rural
home.
It
is
a
language
I
do
not
write
in.
My
second
language
Swahili
I
use
among
my
friends,
I
learnt
it
all
through
primary
and
secondary
school
and
could
write
in
it
just
as
well
as
in
English
before
I
went
abroad.
English
is
my
third
language,
I
have
always
only
used
it
to
speak
to
my
teachers
at
school,
thus
it
had
an
air
of
strangeness
to
it.
I,
however,
managed
to
write
well
in
it
by
reading
a
lot.
Up
to
a
certain
age,
all
my
internal
dialogue
was
held
in
either
Swahili
or
English,
living
abroad
however
has
reduced
the
amount
of
the
former
and
increased
the
latter.
My
writing
has
reflected
each
of
these
changes.
I
find
that
it
a
lot
easier
is
to
come
up
with
first
drafts
of
any
paper
quickly.
Since
a
draft
is
really
just
a
bunch
of
thoughts
on
a
topic,
and
my
internal
dialogue
is
in
English,
it
is
easy
to
do
this.
However,
all
the
colorful
animation
and
expressions
that
I
used
to
have
in
my
writing,
as
a
legacy
of
Swahili,
have
now
disappeared.
I
feel
that
I
write
very
colorless
language
that
says
everything
in
the
standard
everyday
manner,
rather
than
inventing
new
ways
of
saying
ordinary
things,
a
skill
you
learn
if
you
think
in
two
different
languages.
My
writing
has
come
a
long
way,
and
still
has
a
long
way
to
go.
I
look
forward,
however
to
all
the
challenges
along
these
paths.
My
attempts
to
join
the
intellectual
communities
in
college
that
David
Bartholomae
talks
about
in
Inventing
the
University
will
be
eventful
I
am
sure.
I
look
forward
to
every
word
of
it!
