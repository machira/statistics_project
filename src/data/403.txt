Writing
as
a
WA
Fall
2003
As
any
writer
knows,
writing
is
a
long
and
sometimes
arduous
process.
Every
writer
must
go
through
various
stages
and
numerous
revisions
in
order
to
perfect
his
or
her
writing.
Learning
to
write,
and
write
well,
doesnOt
happen
overnight.
Like
any
writer,
my
writing
has
changed
drastically,
having
gone
through
many
different
phases.
However,
the
most
important
change
to
my
writing
has
occurred
this
year
during
my
experience
as
a
WA.
This
year
I
was
able
to
experience
many
different
kinds
of
writing,
whereby
gaining
a
greater
consciousness
of
what
NwritingO
really
is
and
create
my
own
personal
style
of
writing.
My
history
as
a
writer
began
when
I
learned
to
read
and
write
while
in
elementary
school.
As
time
passed
and
my
level
of
education
increased,
I
was
able
to
expand
and
refine
my
writing,
completing
small
writing
assignments.
In
middle
school
and
high
school
I
learned
how
to
compose
works
of
significant
length,
such
as
research
or
opinion
papers,
and
writing
became
easier
and
more
in
depth.
During
my
early
years
at
Lafayette,
I
was
able
to
hone
my
writing
and
further
develop
writing
skills.
But,
despite
all
the
time
I
had
spent
at
school
learning
to
write
and
refining
my
writing,
nothing
had
such
a
profound
influence
on
the
way
I
write
as
what
I
learned
during
my
year
as
a
WA.
This
year
I
was
exposed
to
many
different
and
varied
types
of
student
writing.
I
also
had
the
privilege
of
working
with
two
different
professors
in
two
very
different
academic
fields,
exposing
me
to
different
styles
of
writing.
This
experience
allowed
me
to
change
the
way
I
write
by
incorporating
new
elements
learned
from
other
writers.
Throughout
the
process
of
helping
others
to
improve
upon
their
own
writing,
I
was
able
to
develop
my
own
personal
writing
style,
and
hence
become
a
better
writer.
My
first
semester
as
a
WA,
I
was
assigned
to
Prof.
CooperOs
government
and
politics
FYS
class.
I
was
very
nervous
my
first
day
Non
the
jobO
as
a
WA.
I
was
confident
in
my
ability
as
a
writer,
but
didnOt
know
if
I
had
what
it
took
to
get
the
job
done
right.
I
was
constantly
second
guessing
myself
and
wondering
if
I
was
actually
helping
the
students
I
was
working
with.
However,
as
the
semester
progressed,
my
confidence
grew
and
I
knew
that
I
was
indeed
helping
to
improve
the
writing
of
the
students
in
my
assigned
class.
I
knew
that
I
was
helping
because
with
each
consecutive
paper
that
I
saw,
that
particular
students
writing
seemed
to
improve.
As
a
result
of
these
students
being
freshman
and
coming
from
very
different
academic
backgrounds,
each
student
had
a
unique
style
and
way
of
writing.
However,
most
had
not
yet
learned
the
skills
required
for
Ncollege
writingO.
Many
of
what
I
would
consider,
NfundamentalsO
of
writing
were
either
lacking
in
these
papers
or
just
not
properly
composed.
So,
it
forced
me
to
deeply
consider
and
review
the
more
rudimentary
aspects
of
writing
like:
sentence
structure,
form,
organization,
etc.
and
as
a
result
went
back
and
fixed
my
own
writing
from
the
bottom
up.
Reading
papers
such
as
these
in
which
these
kinds
of
mistakes
were
blaring,
made
me
extra
sensitive
to
the
fundamentals.
By
helping
the
students
to
better
put
together
their
papers,
I
was
really
re-teaching
and
reiterating
these
fundamental
elements
to
myself.
Every
writer
could
use
some
review
every
once
in
a
while.
Each
assignment
in
this
class
was
an
opinion
paper
based
on
research.
Therefore,
the
students
could
use
some
creativity
when
expressing
their
ideas.
Consequently,
each
paper
was
unique
in
its
style.
Some
styles
proved
to
work
in
that
particular
paper,
despite
breaking
or
bending
some
rules
of
writing
that
I
thought
were
absolute.
No
longer
did
I
hold
fast
to
these
rules
whereby
breaking
them
seemed
to
enhance
the
entire
paper.
I
found
that
a
creative
style,
although
it
may
not
adhere
to
fundamental
rules,
can
truly
add
to
the
message
and
aid
in
the
creation
of
a
strong
paper.
By
incorporating
elements
of
these
diverse
styles
into
my
own
writing,
I
was
able
to
enhance
my
own
way
of
writing.
My
second
semester
as
a
WA
proved
to
be
very
different
than
the
first
one.
This
time,
I
was
assigned
to
Prof.
BukicOs
300
level
economics
class.
Here
the
writing
was
very
different
than
the
writing
I
had
seen
the
previous
semester.
The
professor
expected
the
writing
to
be
less
creative
and
very
formulaic.
She
was
very
precise
about
what
she
expected
to
appear
in
each
section
of
the
paper.
She
provided
me
with
specific
rules
and
guidelines
to
follow
when
suggesting
to
the
students
how
best
to
write
their
papers.
Also,
these
papers
were
like
none
that
I
had
ever
read
before.
The
assignments
called
for
the
creation
of
business
plans
and
proposals,
a
paper
based
on
an
interview
of
an
entrepreneur,
and
an
evaluation
of
a
business
plan.
At
first
I
thought
that
not
being
familiar
with
this
kind
of
extremely
structured
writing
would
be
a
challenge,
however
it
proved
to
be
an
advantage.
As
a
result
of
my
lack
of
familiarity
with
the
topic,
I
approached
these
papers
as
an
Noutside
readerO,
one
who
has
not
completed
an
in
depth
study
of
economics.
From
this
viewpoint,
I
was
able
to
read
for
content
and
also
to
make
sure
the
paper
was
clear
and
the
ideas
were
effectively
communicated
so
that
any
person
could
read
it.
Since
the
students
in
this
class
were
juniors
and
seniors,
their
writing
was
more
refined
than
that
of
the
freshman
of
the
first
semester.
Since
these
students
were
experienced
writers,
they
had
a
better
idea
of
what
works
and
what
doesnOt
in
a
paper.
I
learned
a
lot
from
reading
these
papers
and
was
able
to
get
a
better
sense
of
what
works
and
doesnOt
in
my
own
papers.
As
a
result,
my
writing
changed
as
I
acquired
this
new
knowledge.
Having
been
assigned
to
two
very
different
classes
involving
two
very
different
disciplines,
professors,
assignments,
and
class
of
students,
my
understanding
of
writing
and
the
various
forms
it
can
take
surely
expanded.
As
a
consequence
of
having
been
exposed
to
diverse
writings,
I
incorporated
various
aspects
of
these
two
NstylesO
into
my
own
writing
and
developed
my
own
unique
writing
style.
More
specifically,
I
combined
the
formulaic
and
creative,
refined
and
rudimentary
to
come
up
with
a
unique
way
of
writing
that
was
all
my
own.
In
addition
to
my
experiences
as
a
WA
for
these
two
classes,
the
time
I
spent
talking
with
other
WAs
during
WA
staff
meetings
and
on
a
one
on
one
basis
proved
to
be
extremely
enlightening.
These
WAs
provided
me
with
tips
and
strategies
which
had
helped
them
in
their
jobs
as
well
as
in
their
own
writing.
By
listening
to
the
tried
and
perfected
tips,
I
was
able
to
use
the
same
strategies
when
helping
the
students
in
my
WA
class.
In
addition,
I
used
these
methods
on
my
own
papers
as
sort
of
a
self-tutorial.
For
example,
while
speaking
with
another
WA
about
difficulties
the
freshman
in
my
class
were
having
organizing
complicated
papers,
she
suggested
that
the
next
time
I
meet
with
the
students,
I
ask
them
to
go
through
every
single
paragraph
in
their
paper
with
them
and
ask
them
how
that
relates
to
their
thesis.
By
so
doing,
it
enables
that
students
to
truly
focus
their
paper
and
eliminate
any
paragraphs
that
may
be
off
the
point
or
not
necessary
in
the
paper.
This
method
was
very
helpful
not
only
to
the
papers
of
the
freshman,
but
I
also
used
it
when
reading
and
organizing
my
own
papers.
I
found
that
conferring
with
other
WAs,
both
veteran
and
rookie,
helped
me
to
help
others
and
also
myself.
Listening
to
others
share
their
experiences
at
staff
meetings
was
also
particularly
helpful.
Not
only
did
I
benefit
from
learning
about
how
other
WAs
meet
with
students,
but
I
learned
how
they
deal
with
professors
as
well.
Knowing
what
questions
to
ask
and
how
to
assert
yourself
when
dealing
with
professors
is
very
helpful
to
a
WA.
The
most
difficult
challenge
I
encountered
when
meeting
with
my
assigned
professor
was
getting
a
good
idea
of
what
the
assignment
was
and
what
the
professor
expected
from
that
assignment
without
being
in
the
class.
But,
by
asking
lots
of
questions,
I
was
able
to
truly
understand
the
assignment,
and
thereby,
help
the
students
in
my
class.
My
experiences
after
the
school
year
was
over
also
helped
my
writing.
This
summer,
I
was
an
intern
at
a
publishing
company
where
learned
all
about
the
publishing
business
and
had
the
opportunity
to
review
many
books
and
do
a
lot
of
writing.
This
experience
helped
reinforce
the
fact
that
all
writing
must
go
through
various
stages.
Part
of
my
job
was
reviewing
manuscripts
and
finding
corrections
that
needed
to
be
made
in
the
text.
While
finding
comma
mistakes
and
deleting
unwanted
words,
etc,
I
realized
that
even
the
best
writers
need
correcting.
Authors
who
have
authored
many
works
are
not
necessarily
perfect
writers,
and
indeed
their
work
needs
revision
after
revision
after
revision.
Any
good
writing
is
NprocessedO
writing.
After
having
experienced
my
first
year
as
a
WA,
I
would
give
any
new
WA
the
following
bits
of
advice.
Firstly,
have
confidence
in
yourself
as
a
writer.
A
confident
WA
is
a
helpful
WA..
It
is
ok
if
you
donOt
know
all
the
answers.
Also
know
that
there
is
not
only
one
way
to
write
a
paper.
Many
different
techniques
can
be
used
in
writing,
unique
styles
should
be
appreciated,
not
condemned.
Also,
donOt
worry--WAs
donOt
have
all
the
answers.
Often
times,
people
seem
to
think
that
WAs
have
all
the
answers
or
that
WAs
know
everything
there
is
to
know
about
writing.
And
as
much
as
I
would
like
to
admit
this,
unfortunately,
I
cannot.
WAs
can
however
can
be
a
helpful
outside
reader
of
a
paper
and
try
to
help
that
writer
make
improvements
to
their
paper.
I
am
excited
to
start
the
new
academic
year
as
a
WA..
After
having
already
worked
as
a
WA,
I
know
what
to
expect.
I
know
that
this
year
will
go
as
smoothly
as
the
last
and
IOm
glad
to
be
working
with
a
little
bit
more
writing
knowledge
under
my
belt
and
a
better
understanding
of
the
writing
process.
Every
writer
has
a
long
and
unique
writing
history
that
plays
a
very
important
role
in
the
writing
process.
Recognizing
writing
history
can
allow
one
to
truly
become
a
better
writer
by
understanding
where
they
have
come
from
and
helping
them
to
get
an
idea
of
where
they
want
to
go
with
their
writing.
With
everything
I
learned
from
professors,
students,
and
other
WAs,
I
was
able
to
truly
develop
a
stronger
writing
identity
than
the
one
that
I
had
previously
possessed.
My
time
spent
this
year
proved
to
be
crucial
in
my
development
as
a
writer
as
it
forced
me
to
consider
new
ways
of
writing.
As
a
result,
my
writing
has
grown
to
incorporate
new
and
different
elements
and
I
have
truly
developed
my
own
personal
writing
style.
