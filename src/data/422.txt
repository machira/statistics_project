New
WA
essay
August

2004
When
I
moved
to
a
new
home
for
the
first
time,
just
days
shy
of
my
sixteenth
birthday,
I
found
myself
inevitably
lost
in
a
cloud
of
nostalgia.
It
was
not
just
that
I
was
leaving
the
house
I
had
called
my
home
for
my
entire
life,
but
I
had
discovered,
in
my
weeks
of
cleaning
out
my
old
room,
memories
from
my
own
life
I
had
long
forgotten.
Pictures
from
a
fourth
grade
trip
to
the
Lenape
Indian
Reserve,
a
plastic
bag
full
of
tiny
beads
my
second
grade
best
friend
and
myself
collected
off
the
floor
during
free
time,
a
spelling
test
from
third
grade
(with
many
wrong
answers)
and
there
among
the
other
collected
junk
from
my
past
was
a
book
I
wrote
in
first
grade,
bound
by
my
teacherNMrs.
BatesNwith
wrapping
paper,
oak
tag
and
red
string,
a
story
about
a
dog
who
got
lost
on
his
way
home.
The
book
was
illustrated
and
handwritten.
It
is
the
first
writing
experience
I
can
recall.
Fairly
sophisticated
for
a
first
grader
(or
so
I
think)
the
book
brought
back
memories
of
a
time
long
put
behind
me.
Neither
I
or
my
friendly
first
grade
teacher
could
ever
have
known
how
much
writing
would
later
mean
to
me.
I
went
through
the
rest
of
my
elementary
school
days
like
any
other
student.
I
wrote
short
stories
and
essays
as
my
teachers
required,
with
the
exception
of
one
attempt
to
write
a
book
with
a
friend
in
fifth
grade
(which
never
managed
to
actually
materialize
itself).
This
idea
formalized
shortly
after
we
both
read
The
Lion
the
Witch
and
the
Wardrobe.
With
this
small
exception,
I
showed
no
extra
love
for
writing.
Middle
school
proceeded
similarly
as
I
wrote
research
and
creative
writings
in
my
required
classes.
Although
I
did
well
in
all
my
English
courses,
and
showed
a
great
love
for
reading
as
I
had
my
whole
life,
I
doubt
I
stood
out
to
any
of
my
teachers
as
having
any
extra
talent
as
a
writer.
In
fact,
I
excelled
in
mathematical
courses,
and
was
a
terrible
speller,
so
I
was
encouraged
to
work
at
my
algebra
and
pre-calculus
and
was
never
really
pushed
in
the
literary
field.
In
fact,
it
wasnOt
until
my
senior
year
of
high
school
that
I
realized
I
might
prefer
writing
to
solving
equations
(although
my
strengths
appeared
to
be
in
mathematics
all
my
electives
were
used
for
English
courses
as
I
enjoyed
them
immensely).
I
took
a
creative
writing
course
in
which
I
was
introduced
to
the
poetry
of
Charles
Bukowski,
who
quickly
became
an
inspiration
for
me
in
terms
of
contemporary
poetry
and
short
stories.
As
I
started
writing
I
also
starting
reading
contemporary
works.
Billy
Collins
and
Stephan
Dunn
became
regulars
in
my
day
and
suddenly
I
thought
of
nothing
but
poetry.
I
started
writing
and
within
a
semester
had
written
close
to
fifty
poems.
As
this
time
paralleled
my
breakup
with
my
first
boyfriend,
the
poetry
I
wrote
had
the
soft
melancholy
aura
of
lost
love
along
with
the
words
of
girl
struggling
to
understand
herself.
During
this
time
poetry
became
part
of
who
I
was.
For
years
I
had
ignored
my
creative
instincts
and
suddenly
I
found
17
years
of
suppressed
creativity
poured
into
journals,
restaurant
napkins,
receipts,
or
anything
else
that
I
could
find
when
the
moment
struck
me.
By
the
time
I
graduated
from
high
school
I
knew
I
wanted
to
try
my
hand
as
a
writer.
Unfortunately,
I
had
applied
to
college
before
my
writing
epiphany
hit,
and
thus
I
found
myself,
in
the
summer
of
2002,
enrolled
at
Lafayette
College
as
an
Engineer.
I
quickly
changed
my
schedule
to
courses
in
the
liberal
arts,
against
the
will
of
my
father
who
encouraged
me
to
stay
with
a
field
in
which
he
better
saw
my
talents.
But
I
was
determined.
I
had
confidence
in
my
new
talent.
However,
it
was
here
at
Lafayette
that
I
found
my
first
discouragement,
in
my
First
Year
Seminar.
I
dove
into
my
courses
with
zest,
as
I
was
determined
to
prove
to
my
father
that
I
was
as
talented
with
words
as
with
numbers.
However,
my
years
of
inexperience
must
have
been
evident
to
my
FYS
professor,
as
my
first
paper,
which
I
had
written
with
such
pride
and
confidence
was
handed
back
to
me
with
a
C-.
I
had
never
received
such
a
poor
grade.
IOll
admit,
I
went
to
my
room
and
cried.
For
the
first
time
I
doubted
myself.
I
remember
holding
my
then
recent
Calculus
test
(which
I
had
almost
aced)
and
my
FYS
paper
in
front
of
me
and
cursed
myself
for
changing
everything
so
quickly.
My
next
semester
I
took
random
classes,
for
though
my
grades
had
improved
in
my
FYS,
I
felt
inferior
to
the
other
students
in
my
class
and
was
still
discouraged
to
strive
for
my
goal
so
blindly.
To
be
honest,
I
was
afraid
I
would
fail.
However,
second
semester
proved
much
better
than
the
first.
My
college
writing
teacher
quickly
became
a
new
source
of
inspiration,
and
as
I
voiced
my
fears
to
him
that
I
would
fall
short
as
a
writer
he
encouraged
me
and
told
me
it
was
not
too
late
to
take
myself
seriously
as
a
writer,
he
believed
I
could
succeed.
Under
his
guidance
I
went
out
and
bought
a
fancy
pen
and
journal
and
continued
to
write.
I
submitted
a
poem
to
the
school
literary
magazine,
which
was
accepted,
and
although
it
was
only
a
small
success,
it
was
the
confidence
I
needed.
I
began
writing
on
a
regular
basis
again
and
confidence
returned
to
my
writing.
I
did
well
in
my
English
courses,
though
I
knew
it
was
not
literary
analysis
where
my
talents
lay
so
I
wrote
off
poorer
grades
not
as
failures
but
simply
as
irrelevant.
During
my
sophomore
year
I
took
Literary
Questions,
where
I
had
the
opportunity
to
present
one
creative
piece
to
my
professor.
When
the
paper
came
back
with
the
note,
Nhave
you
ever
considered
pursuing
creative
writing?O
I
felt
relieved
and
the
doubts
from
my
failures
freshman
year
were
alleviated.
I
declared
myself
an
English
major,
learned
how
to
write
papers
other
than
just
literally
analysis
(such
as
philosophy),
told
my
advisor
my
hopes
to
make
it
as
a
writer,
had
another
poem
published
in
the
Marquis,
and
although
I
was
once
again
told
the
creative
writing
class
was
full
(how
people
sign
up
for
that
class
really
needs
to
be
changed)
I
finally
felt
I
had
everything
under
control.
When
I
applied
to
the
WA
program
sophomore
year
I
had
confidence
I
would
be
accepted.
In
the
past
my
friends
all
came
to
me
to
look
over
their
papers
rather
than
the
WA
service
as
they
claimed
I
helped
them
more.
But,
as
always
happens
when
I
become
confident,
I
was
not
accepted
to
the
program.
Slightly
annoyed
(as
well
as
sheepishly
embarrassed
by
my
former
confidence)
I
moved
away
for
the
summer
to
Burlington,
VT
to
live
with
friends.
Here
I
took
a
job
working
in
an
art
museum,
where
I
was
allowed
to
read
while
working.
Over
the
summer
I
read
several
novels,
many
books
of
poetry
and
a
plethora
of
collections
of
short
stories.
I
branched
out
from
only
writing
poetry
to
also
working
on
a
few
short
stories
and
dropped
my
grudge
at
the
English
department
for
not
hiring
me
as
a
WA
(although
I
still
was
annoyed
by
my
constant
failure
to
be
let
into
the
creative
writing
class).
Around
this
time
I
heard
from
Professor
Seetch
that
an
opening
had
occurred
in
the
program
and
would
I
like
the
spot?
Of
course
I
accepted
(again
feeling
discomforted
at
my
original
cockiness)
and
was
overjoyed
at
the
turn
of
events,
which
leads
me
to
where
I
am
currently,
sitting
and
writing
this
Onarrative
of
my
growth
in
literacy.O
My
building
as
a
writer
has
been,
in
the
long
of
things,
a
recent
endeavor.
Had
I
never
taken
that
high
school
writing
class,
I
may
have
realized
my
love
for
poetry
too
late
to
pursue
an
English
major.
Looking
back
at
that
first
FYS
paper
that
was
so
discouraging,
it
probably
did
deserve
the
C-,
as
it
was
no
better
than
my
high
school
papers;
the
poor
grade
forcing
me
to
improve.
From
that
first
class
until
now,
my
writing,
both
for
classes
and
for
myself
has
grown
as
I
have,
all
my
new
experiences
allowing
me
to
pour
more
of
myself
onto
the
written
page.
I
can
only
imagine
my
experience
as
a
WA
will
not
only
allow
me
to
help
others
but
to
help
me
further
myself
as
a
writer.
