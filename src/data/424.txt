Literacy
Narrative,
WA
2004
Considering
how
important
writing
is
to
my
life
right
now,
I
find
it
shocking
that
I
canOt
seem
to
recall
when
or
how
it
first
began
to
influence
me.
From
my
earliest
days
in
school,
I
can
remember
finding
things
like
phonics,
spelling,
and
expressing
myself
in
words
very
simple.
I
was
inwardly
proud
of
my
OskillsO,
but
the
motivation
behind
that
pride
was
that
it
made
me
feel
different
and
important
D
not
because
I
had
any
appreciation
for
what
those
skills
meant
or
could
be
used
for.
Because
I
was
not
popular
at
school
and
was
always
by
myself,
I
spent
most
of
my
time
retreating
into
my
imagination.
As
I
went
up
through
fourth
grade,
I
continued
to
keep
to
myself
and
my
dreaming,
rather
than
socialize
or
join
sports
like
other
people
my
age.
Around
that
time,
after
receiving
Madeline
LOEngleOs
A
Wrinkle
in
Time
as
a
present,
I
became
interested
in
science
fiction
and
fantasy
for
the
first
time.
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
imagining
what
it
would
be
like
to
be
swept
away
from
my
real
life,
and
off
to
a
new
place
where
the
fantastic
came
to
life
and
my
dreams
came
true.
Although
it
was
a
very
lonely
point
in
my
life,
I
think
all
my
secluded
daydreaming
and
desire
to
communicate
with
people
meaningfully
planted
the
seeds
that
would
later
grow
into
my
passion
for
writing,
particularly
writing
fantasy.
While
this
was
happening,
I
began
my
first
serious
writing
project.
My
sister
and
I,
along
with
some
friends
from
our
church,
developed
a
strong
interest
in
the
environment,
and
formed
an
NAnimal
ClubO.
We
decided
to
make
a
magazine
together
as
a
form
of
environmental
education.
I,
being
the
most
interested
in
the
project,
was
asked
to
be
editor,
and
we
all
wrote
research
articles
on
various
topics
and
compiled
them
into
a
OmagazineO.
Leafing
through
the
results
of
our
efforts
now,
our
little
magazine
is
terribly
and
adorably
incompetent,
but
at
the
time
we
felt
very
professional
sending
it
out
to
our
subscribers.
I
attribute
the
immense
satisfaction
I
got
out
of
writing
the
articles
to
the
fact
that
I
had
not
yet
been
assigned
a
Oresearch
paperO
at
school,
because
the
thought
of
doing
them
for
simple
enjoyment
now
strikes
me
as
insane.
My
sixth
grade
English
class
was
taught
by
a
wonderful,
energetic,
and
passionate
woman
named
Mrs.
Williamson.
She
was
like
a
heroine
to
me,
and
hers
was
the
first
class
that
I
can
remember
truly
loving.
In
her
class,
I
experimented
with
creative
short
stories
and
poetry
for
the
first
time,
but
I
was
extremely
sensitive
about
my
work.
I
hated
swapping
papers
with
other
students
to
trade
critique,
and
every
comment
on
my
graded
work
that
suggested
imperfection
almost
brought
me
to
tears,
especially
coming
from
Mrs.
W.
Writing
was
my
special,
private
haven,
and
I
hated
sharing
it
with
others
who
could
shatter
my
confidence
so
easily.
I
had
finally
begun
to
make
friends
at
school,
but
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
show
them
my
work.
I
sternly
believed
I
had
no
desire
to
have
my
writing
judged
or
accepted
by
others,
although
my
reaction
to
critique
contradicted
this
entirely.
I
had
one
friend
in
Mrs.
WOs
class
who
I
saw
as
a
bit
of
a
rival.
She
was
very
skilled
at
both
writing
and
art
-
the
star
of
our
class
-
and
I
was
jealous
of
her.
One
time,
she
showed
me
something
she
had
written
that
she
was
clearly
proud
of,
and
I
gave
her
a
blunt,
harsh
review
even
though
it
was
excellent,
just
because
I
was
jealous.
A
year
later,
it
came
up
in
conversation
and
it
turned
out
that
she
had
taken
it
all
to
heart,
and
that
I
had
hurt
her
confidence
badly.
I
was
shocked
that
the
girl
I
had
jealously
characterized
as
snotty
and
impenetrable
had
actually
been
a
delicate,
insecure
writer
just
like
me
all
along,
and
felt
absolutely
terrible.
I
learned
from
that
experience
what
a
heavy
responsibility
it
is
to
critique
another
personOs
work,
and
have
not
taken
it
lightly
ever
since.
In
eighth
grade,
I
decided
to
write
a
Ofan
fictionO
story
based
on
a
show
I
liked
called
Sailor
Moon.
This
project
was
a
first
for
me
in
many
ways.
It
was
my
first
writing
project
that
exceeded
a
few
pages.
It
was
my
first
time
writing
fiction
for
fun
outside
of
class.
It
was
the
first
time
IOd
tried
composing
something
on
a
computer
instead
of
paper.
It
was
also
the
first
time
I
shared
my
writing
with
my
friends
at
school.
For
the
most
part,
they
were
impressed,
but
there
was
plenty
for
them
to
criticize.
When
they
told
me
what
they
thought
of
it,
I
was
extremely
defensive.
I
could
not
accept
their
comments
gracefully
at
all.
Even
grammar
and
simple
spelling
corrections
were
offensive
to
me,
and
I
walled
up
the
moment
they
were
mentioned.
I
thought
of
my
writing
as
a
finished
product
to
be
shared
and
accepted
as-is,
rather
than
something
that
could
develop
and
improve,
and
so
I
interpreted
my
friendsO
critique,
especially
when
it
was
correct,
as
a
rejection
of
my
work.
I
eventually
stopped
writing
the
story,
which
had
grown
to
eleven
chapters,
because
I
ran
out
of
plot.
However,
now
that
IOd
had
a
taste
of
the
excitement
of
fiction
writing,
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
before
I
found
something
new
to
write.
When
I
entered
high
school,
life
started
changing
a
lot.
I
suddenly
had
a
lot
of
friends,
and
hung
out
with
them
every
day.
The
Animal
Club
magazine,
along
with
the
club
itself,
fell
by
the
wayside
and
then
disintegrated
altogether.
Some
friends
and
I
began
playing
an
online
fantasy-themed
role
playing
game
called
EverQuest,
and
I
was
fascinated
by
it.
The
virtual
online
world
it
took
place
in
and
the
feeling
I
got
while
playing
it
were
just
like
the
dreams
IOd
had
of
being
transported
to
another
realm
and
living
a
life
of
adventure.
I
decided
to
script
all
of
my
friendsO
characters
and
my
own
into
a
new
story,
this
time
based
on
EverQuest.
This
was
a
step
up
from
the
Sailor
Moon
story
as
far
as
creativity
because
at
least
the
charactersO
personalities
were
not
predetermined
for
me,
but
because
I
used
the
geography,
history,
and
culture
of
the
gameOs
world,
it
still
fell
into
the
realm
of
fan
fiction.
I
did
a
lot
of
things
differently
with
this
new
story.
As
I
went
on,
the
themes
I
used
became
more
and
more
mature,
touching
on
things
like
racism,
isolation,
love,
loss,
and
suicide.
I
had
never
tried
writing
about
such
serious
things
before.
By
now,
I
could
not
contemplate
composing
writing
without
a
word
processor,
and
began
to
post
each
chapter
up
on
my
website
where
anyone,
including
strangers,
could
see
it.
I
was
still
very
bad
at
taking
criticism,
but
by
that
point
I
had
recognized
that
flaw
in
myself,
and
was
more
careful
to
restrain
my
reaction
when
others
offered
me
advice.
Rather
than
feel
bitter,
I
tried,
for
the
first
time,
to
channel
my
frustration
into
improving
my
mistakes
rather
than
mulling
over
them.
I
felt
that
I
should
learn
more
words,
so
I
began
to
read
vocabulary
books
from
Barnes
and
Noble
for
fun,
secretly
enjoying
the
astonished
teasing
it
provoked
from
my
friends.
I
worked
on
the
story
for
two
years,
writing
only
occasionally
in
my
spare
time.
When
I
finished
the
thirteenth
chapter,
I
went
back
and
looked
over
the
first
chapters
I
had
written
two
years
before.
I
was
astonished
by
how
the
writing
I
had
been
so
pleased
with
when
I
first
wrote
it
now
seemed
embarrassingly
poor.
My
writing
style
had
changed
completely
over
the
course
of
the
story.
Throwing
away
eighty
pages
of
work
and
starting
the
story
over
was
probably
the
most
difficult
decision
IOve
had
to
make
as
a
writer.
I
was
struck
all
at
once
with
the
reality
that
writing
was
never
finished;
it
was
always
a
work
in
progress.
For
the
first
time,
I
felt
an
intense
need
to
make
the
people
who
read
my
story
love
my
characters
and
worry
about
them
as
much
as
I
did.
Unless
I
wrote
it
well,
I
realized,
the
only
person
who
would
care
what
happened
to
my
characters
was
me.
I
had
to
somehow
make
other
people
understand
them
well
enough
to
care
about
them
as
well.
I
believed,
and
still
believe,
that
the
greatest
honor
a
writer
can
receive
is
for
her
characters
to
be
loved.
For
someone
to
create
a
fictional
being
and
somehow
describe
its
dreams,
passions
and
expressions
well
enough
to
make
it
real
to
someone
else
D
that
is
the
true
essence
of
what
it
means
to
be
an
incredible
author.
I
acknowledged
that
to
meet
this
goal,
I
would
need
to
expose
myself
to,
and
learn
to
accept,
the
critique
of
others.
With
this
in
mind,
I
joined
an
online
community
called
Fictionpress.net
D
a
peer
review
site
for
fiction
authors.
I
decided
to
break
away
from
fan
fiction
as
I
began
to
rewrite
my
EverQuest
story,
painstakingly
attempting
to
make
the
characters
and
setting
entirely
my
own
while
still
following
my
original
plot
to
some
extent.
As
I
completed
each
chapter,
I
posted
it
on
Fictionpress
under
the
title
Identity
Crisis,
where
other
authors
gave
me
thorough,
but
supportive
advice.
I
began
to
participate
in
the
peer
review
aspect
of
the
site
as
well,
and
read
a
lot
of
other
peopleOs
stories.
Some
of
them
were
extremely
impressive,
while
others
were
quite
bad.
The
experiences
of
reviewing
and
being
reviewed
taught
me
a
lot
about
the
psychology
of
critique.
I
picked
up
many
techniques
for
tact,
balance,
and
honesty
from
the
other
authors
as
I
became
more
involved
in
the
community
there.
I
also
learned
to
appreciate
harsher
reviews
because
they
were
more
helpful
to
me,
even
to
the
point
where
I
began
to
feel
disappointed
by
generic,
friendly
reviews
(NGreat
story!
Write
more!O).
I
had
written
about
five
chapters
of
Identity
Crisis
by
the
time
I
started
college,
but
had
to
put
it
in
the
background
to
make
time
for
class
and
the
dreaded
Ncollege
writingO
I
had
heard
so
much
about.
It
had
been
drilled
into
my
head
that
college
writing
was
something
entirely
different
from
high
school
writing
D
an
evil
and
impossible
challenge
that
broke
the
egos
of
anyone
who
dared
to
say
NI
got
straight
AOs
in
English
all
through
high
school!O
like
toothpicks.
Honestly,
I
didnOt
find
it
to
be
much
of
a
change.
I
did
receive
a
few
harsher
grades
than
I
was
accustomed
to,
but
the
lower
grades
were
balanced
out
by
a
much
higher
quality
of
comments
and
suggestions
scribbled
over
my
work.
My
conclusion
is
that
itOs
not
that
college
standards
are
too
high,
but
rather
that
grade
school
standards
are
quite
low.
The
biggest
change
for
me
in
adapting
to
college
writing
was
that
there
was
a
lot
more
of
it.
I
was
suddenly
faced
with
a
much
larger
volume
of
papers
to
write
at
once
than
IOd
ever
had
before.
I
began
writing
complete
outlines
before
beginning
anything
more
than
a
few
pages
long
D
a
convention
I
had
never
bothered
with
in
the
past.
I
also
began
to
self-analyze
my
procrastination
habit,
which
has
always
been
a
problem
for
me.
I
donOt
believe
I
have
ever
written
a
paper
before
the
day
it
was
due.
Even
with
the
writing
I
do
for
fun,
I
set
arbitrary
deadlines
for
myself
and
then
procrastinate
up
to
them.
I
just
canOt
bring
myself
to
start
work
without
a
deadline
looming
over
my
head.
I
donOt
enjoy
the
feeling
I
get
while
procrastinating,
so
IOm
not
really
sure
why
I
still
do
it.
There
are
a
few
things
that
seem
to
help
me
get
started
though.
First
of
all,
to
write
I
need
to
have
my
workspace
spotless
and
clear
of
distractions.
I
need
my
music
off
and
my
desk
clean.
I
also
need
to
either
have
an
outline
finished
or
have
everything
thoroughly
thought
out
in
my
head
before
I
start.
The
support
of
someone
who
is
eager
to
read
my
final
product,
such
as
a
friend
or
a
peer
on
Fictionpress,
is
an
extremely
big
help
when
it
is
available,
though
it
is
hard
to
come
by,
particularly
for
scholastic
papers.
One
thing
I
never
really
did
much
of
until
college
is
proofreading
my
friendsO
papers.
For
whatever
reason,
several
of
my
friends
began
asking
me
to
proofread
their
papers
for
them
at
college.
I
have
to
admit
I
find
it
flattering
to
be
asked
to
help
with
someoneOs
paper,
and
I
actually
enjoy
proofreading
it.
Reading
other
peoplesO
writing
also
sometimes
gives
me
insights
that
can
help
me
improve
my
own.
It
was
awkward,
however,
to
tell
other
writers
my
suggestions
to
their
face
for
the
first
time.
All
my
previous
critiquing
work
had
been
done
in
text,
and
now
I
was
not
only
commenting
in
person,
but
to
people
who
I
considered
good
friends.
Being
a
WA
will
put
my
in-person
advice
skills
to
the
test,
but
IOm
looking
forward
to
all
the
things
I
will
learn
from
the
experience.
If
I
were
to
describe
myself
as
a
writer
at
this
point
in
my
life,
I
would
say
that
I
am
a
work-in-progress,
continually
changing.
I
am
still
sensitive
to
critique,
but
my
response
to
it
is
becoming
more
and
more
constructive
as
I
become
more
used
to
the
fact
that
my
work
will
always
have
faults
and
areas
that
can
be
improved
upon.
I
like
to
write
about
the
fantastic
and
impossible,
and
part
of
me
still
lives
in
another
world
full
of
dreams.
IOm
a
terrible
procrastinator,
but
I
love
the
feeling
I
get
when
I
can
look
at
my
completed
work.
What
I
love
most
about
writing,
however,
is
that
I
can
take
the
people,
places
and
emotions
of
my
imagination
and
express
them
on
paper.
By
doing
that,
others
can
experience
the
same
thoughts
as
mine,
and
once
it
can
be
experienced
by
other
people,
the
story
ceases
to
be
a
dream
and,
in
a
way,
becomes
a
part
of
reality.
My
work-in-progress,
Identity
Crisis,
continues
to
be
a
huge
and
important
part
of
my
life,
and
will
hopefully
be
worth
publishing
someday.
