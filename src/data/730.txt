Personal
Writing
History
Even
as
a
young
boy,
writing
enthralled
me.
Though
my
interests
have
grown
since
then,
the
spirit
of
writing
captivated
me
then
as
it
does
now.
I
always
loved
to
read
in
elementary
school.
Each
day
I
eagerly
anticipated
what
new
book
or
poem
my
teacher
would
introduce
to
the
class.
Poetry
moved
me
most,
not
for
the
feelings
it
stirred,
but
for
the
way
it
bended
language
into
unusual
forms
totally
distant
from
everyday
usage.
Teachers
and
peers
praised
poetry
or
prose
for
their
hardy
themes
or
timeless
messages.
I,
for
one,
found
those
themes
duplicated
time
and
time
again
to
the
point
that
them
alone
were
not
sufficient
to
call
a
written
text
Ngood.O
I
looked
at
language
always,
meticulously,
and
found
enjoyment
in
a
risqu
rhyme
or
an
odd
paradox.
Though
a
valiant
theme
should
be
praised,
I
first
decided
to
judge
literatureOs
merits
based
on
style
alone.
In
my
admiration
of
their
style,
I
attempted
to
emulate
my
favorite
stories
in
my
personal
writing.
In
elementary
school
they
encouraged
student
writing
through
the
Young
Authors
program.
Once
a
year,
someone
would
collect
short
stories,
poetry,
and
more
from
every
class
and
publish
the
very
best
in
that
yearOs
anthology.
It
was
an
exciting
time
of
year
when
the
teacher
would
allocate
class
time
for
us
to
write
whatever
we
wished.
I
only
wrote
short
stories,
about
a
page
or
two
written
by
hand
in
length.
Though
we
were
allowed
to
write
whatever
we
wanted,
and
I
was
never
censored
in
endeavors,
I
can
assume
in
retrospect
that
some
children
were
stopped
short
if
their
stories
became
too
PG-13.
I
always
wrote
fantasy
stories
about
one
franchise
or
another
that
at
the
time
captivated
my
interest
and
my
parentsO
money
D
today
one
might
call
my
entries
primitive
fan
fiction.
For
example,
I
wrote
a
story
in
the
Fire
Emblem
universe,
a
video
game
placed
in
a
time
of
medieval
technology
and
magic.
I
only
wrote
during
school
hours;
perhaps
I
was
busy
getting
inspiration
on
my
console
at
home.
My
teacher
had
us
write
in
pencil
and
paper
first,
as
a
rough
draft,
before
moving
on
to
the
computers
(which
were
limited).
The
way
I
wrote,
I
already
had
a
plot
in
mind
before
even
setting
anything
down
on
paper.
The
only
thing
I
had
to
do
was
flesh
out
the
details
and
use
some
of
that
NstyleO
I
loved
to
read
in
others.
I
truly
enjoyed
writing
with
pencil.
It
made
me
feel
in
control
of
my
story.
When
typing
it
on
the
computer,
I
felt
I
was
merely
transferring
data;
the
computer
added
nothing
to
my
creation.
I
felt
accomplished
after
printing
my
story
and
holding
it
in
my
hands,
and
even
more
so
when
holding
it
in
the
published
book.
In
retrospect,
the
joyous
connection
I
had
with
writing
in
my
early
youth
stemmed
from
a
freedom
which
would
be
stifled
in
years
to
come
until
it
returned
late
in
high
school,
and
blossomed
in
college.
When
I
graduated
to
middle
school,
I
found
another
Young
AuthorOs
program.
Though
less
encouraged
than
in
elementary
school,
I
was
excited
to
start
writing
again.
This
time,
however,
we
were
told
to
write
a
particular
kind
of
story:
a
fable.
As
I
set
about
to
write,
I
knew
a
fable
was
a
story
with
a
very
clear
message.
Like
before,
I
chose
to
write
about
something
that
interested
me
at
the
time.
In
this
case
I
wrote
about
a
boy
at
the
top
of
his
class
who
was
duped
into
playing
Magic:
the
Gathering.
It
was
honestly
not
a
very
good
fable;
my
message
was
essentially
that
one
should
not
be
too
arrogant
and
that
you
are
never
the
best
at
everything.
When
I
handed
my
story
to
my
teacher,
she
gave
it
back
to
me
asking
where
the
moral
was.
Well,
like
all
stories
I
thought,
the
moral
was
implied
within
the
events
of
the
story.
Besides,
I
had
hinted
at
it
in
the
last
few
lines.
Regardless,
I
had
to
explicitly
state
my
theme
in
its
more
ubiquitous
phrasing
in
its
own
paragraph
of
about
three
lines.
That
edition
seemed
to
be
worthy
and
my
teacher
took
it
without
comment.
After
this
event
I
thought
to
myself
that
as
I
write
for
school
I
should
be
careful
to
do
exactly
what
the
teacher
wants,
even
if
her
definition
and
mine
of
what
I
should
be
writing
(in
this
case
a
fable)
should
differ.
The
next
year,
I
had
a
break
from
creative
writing.
My
teachers
were
very
concerned
with
student
improvement,
but
they
were
more
concerned
that
we
were
concerned.
After
each
quarter
of
the
year
our
English
teacher
would
reintroduce
us
to
a
form
of
writing
I
would
learn
to
loathe:
the
self-reflective
paper.
I
hated
it
in
truth
only
because
I
did
not
see
it
being
practical
at
all.
The
assignment
ran
like
this:
my
English
teacher
gave
me
my
grades
and
any
comments
from
teachers
from
my
four
courses:
science,
history,
English,
and
math.
Then,
I
was
to
write
one
page
in
my
journal
(a
spiral
notebook)
for
each
course
detailing
how
I
improved
from
last
quarter
and
how
I
could
improve
next
quarter.
Here
was
where
it
seemed
pointless:
my
grades
were
all
in
the
top
percentage
and
my
comments
without
flaw
that
I,
as
a
prideful
fourteen
year-old,
could
not
find
room
for
improvement.
In
the
end,
I
addressed
points
of
weakness
not
given
by
the
report
in
front
of
me,
and
more
or
less
made
up
weakness
in
order
to
fill
the
page.
Unlike
my
creative
ventures
I
found
this
writing
thoroughly
annoying,
and
I
heartily
rejected
any
good
it
could
have
done
to
me.
When
I
entered
high
school,
my
writing
career
veered
away
from
creative
stories
and
reflection
as
I
entered
the
realm
of
essays
and
theses.
Though
I
eventually
learned
to
enjoy
such
writing,
my
ninth
grade
curriculum
was
no
good
start.
My
teacher
was
a
stickler
for
grammar
(something
we
shared)
but
she
was
even
more
stubborn
on
the
topic
of
structure.
She
taught
her
students
how
to
write
a
proof
paragraph
which
extended
into
the
five
paragraph
essay.
Everyone
detested
the
proof
paragraph.
While
most
complained
of
its
complicated
structure,
I
criticized
its
lack
of
logic
and
rejection
of
any
sense
of
Nflow.O
Here
it
is
explained:
The
proof
paragraph
starts
with
a
topic
sentence,
contains
two
or
more
transitional
example
sentences,
two
or
more
supporting
detail
sentences
per
example,
and
finally
one
clincher
sentence
to
wrap
it
up.
My
teacher
gave
us
all
lists
of
transition
words
to
use
for
each
example
sentence.
While
a
proof
paragraph
may
have
been
fine
alone,
in
a
five
paragraph
essay
it
became
redundant.
I
found
myself
repeating
transition
words
by
the
second
paragraph.
The
entire
essay
also
felt
redundant
in
form;
since
all
paragraphs
had
the
same
structure,
it
read
more
like
a
collection
of
independent
paragraphs
than
a
paper
with
a
single
argument.
Though
a
confusing
and
difficult
method,
the
proof
paragraph
nonetheless
marked
my
introduction
to
the
use
of
textual
evidence.
Meanwhile
on
the
other
end
of
the
academic
spectrum,
I
was
exploring
another
type
of
writing
that
same
year.
While
for
the
first
time
English
studies
bored
me,
science
seemed
to
invigorate
me.
Ninth
grade
physics
was
my
first
real
taste
of
science
and
scientific
thinking,
a
mode
which
dominated
my
perception
from
thereafter.
Throughout
physics
class
we
kept
a
lab
journal
where
we
recorded
our
experiments
and
conclusions.
The
structure
was
simple
and
needed
only
a
day
to
get
used
to.
The
real
test,
however,
came
at
the
end
of
the
year
when
we
were
to
type
up
a
formal
lab
report.
We
cataloged
the
data
of
our
data
in
pen
as
usual,
but
then
had
to
synthesize
that
into
a
more
formal
report.
The
key
to
science
writing
was
to
be
as
concise,
yet
detailed
as
possible.
This,
along
with
understanding
just
where
to
put
your
information
in
the
report,
would
earn
the
student
a
good
grade.
I
seemed
to
have
a
knack
for
his
type
of
writing
because
my
teacher
made
a
show
of
my
report
and
kept
for
at
least
two
years
after
as
an
example
for
future
students.
My
pride
aside,
the
class
was
a
good
foundation
to
kind
of
lab
reports
I
would
be
writing
in
college
level
classes.
My
next
substantial
leap
forward
in
writing
came
two
years
later
in
my
junior
year
of
high
school.
Every
year
we
had
to
write
a
research
paper,
but
my
junior
English
teacher
insured
that
we
knew
what
we
were
writing.
For
the
first
few
weeks
of
class,
he
subjected
us
to
writing
boot
camp.
While
not
as
physically
taxing
as
it
sounds,
it
was
a
series
of
mentally
intense
activities
to
hone
our
writing
skills.
He
stressed
the
importance
of
pre-writing,
outlining,
and
editing,
all
of
which
I
had
not
done
much
of
before.
The
most
valuable
lesson,
however,
was
the
formation
of
the
thesis
statement
of
our
paper.
My
theses
before
sounded
more
like
obvious,
declarative
statement;
for
example,
NThe
Scottsboro
Boys
trial
revealed
the
great
injustice
of
Southern
race-relations.O
My
teacher
discouraged
that
kind
of
writing,
instead
wanting
us
to
fashion
our
thesis
statement
like
an
argument.
It
should
not
be
an
obvious
statement,
and
should
be
able
to
be
backed
up
by
evidence.
A
stronger
grasp
on
the
focus
of
my
paper
along
with
the
destruction
of
the
proof
paragraph
lead
to
a
more
cohesive,
clearer,
and
enjoyable
writing
style.
In
senior
English,
I
compounded
the
lessons
learned
the
previous
year
alongside
an
introduction
to
literary
writing.
My
senior
English
teacher
also
gave
us
ample
practice
writing
an
argument
for
the
research
paper.
This
method
would
be
more
important
now
because
our
paper
took
the
form
of
a
literary
analysis
of
a
particular
author.
By
this
time
I
had
also
learned
to
expertly
incorporate
quotes
into
my
paper;
for
example,
knowing
when
to
cite
evidence
from
the
author's
work
itself
or
from
another
critic.
In
the
vein
of
literary
criticism,
my
teacher
introduced
us
to
critical
lenses
of
analysis.
She
explained
that
every
critic
wrote
from
a
certain
lens,
a
perception,
which
shaped
how
they
felt
about
and
understood
a
text.
This
idea
of
NlensesO
would
soon
evolve
into
what
I
learned
in
college
as
schools
of
criticism
coupled
with
the
extensive
and
ever
confusing
realm
of
theory.
With
such
a
thorough
base
in
writing
I
felt
confident
when
I
entered
my
first
college
classes.
The
first
major
writing
I
had
to
do
for
a
class
was,
luckily
for
me,
a
research
paper.
With
guidance
from
my
professor,
I
created
an
even
more
complex
thesis
statement
and
supported
it
with
evidence
from
a
variety
of
sources.
Though
this
was
a
good
test
of
my
skills
at
the
time,
my
second
semester
English
class
really
changed
the
way
I
wrote.
My
second
semester
class
introduced
students
to
the
way
actual
literary
scholars
write
about
texts.
In
this
class,
I
learned
about
theory
D
the
way
people
think
about
literature.
For
the
essays
in
that
class,
our
teacher
encouraged
us
to
write
in
any
theory
we
wanted.
Before
this
time
I
would
have
been
terribly
afraid
to
write
with
any
kind
of
bias;
my
research
papers
sure
enough
had
an
argument,
but
always
appeared
more
objective
than
anything.
However,
as
I
learned,
every
critic
has
his
or
her
own
biases
and
background.
It
is
up
to
the
reader
to
understand
these
biases
and
react
accordingly.
In
this
way
I
wrote
my
essays;
I
acknowledged,
subtly,
my
own
bias
and
the
critical
standpoint
I
wrote
from.
I
also
acknowledged
the
critical
assumptions
my
future
readers
might
take.
That
was
how
I
understood
academic
discourse.
By
bringing
together
different
assumptions
and
biases
new
understandings
of
texts
can
be
reached.
Writing
had
become
a
cultural
endeavor
for
me;
I
was
never
writing
alone,
but
always
with
my
own
and
others'
ideas
in
mind.
In
terms
of
style,
my
writing
gained
a
much
needed
boost
when
I
finally
began
writing
critically
in
another
language.
Though
I
had
taken
French
every
year
of
high
school,
I
had
never
wrote
extensively
in
the
language.
In
an
advanced
language
course
in
college
I
would
be
required
to
write
about
two
pages
every
other
week.
The
biggest
obstacle
that
came
was
my
lack
of
vocabulary.
When
I
say
vocabulary,
I
mean
words
I
might
use
in
transition
or
conjunction.
In
French,
a
word
I
might
use
in
the
middle
of
the
sentence
NdoncO
for
NthereforeO
was
erroneous
in
the
beginning,
instead
use
Npar
consquent.O
Without
proper
transitions
my
writing
looked
like
a
bunch
of
declarative
statements
which
certainly
lead
to
an
understandable
conclusion,
but
lacked
the
kind
of
verbal
flow
in
my
better
English
essays.
Beyond
my
vocabulary,
I
also
became
more
attentive
as
to
how
I
developed
an
argument.
My
French
professor
favored
a
deductive
method
where
I
explained
the
plot
of
the
novel,
play,
etc.,
and
then
moved
toward
the
symbolic
meaning.
Though
I
understand
both
induction
and
deduction
from
high
school
English,
I
never
really
put
them
into
practice
until
I
wrote
in
French.
After
that
class
I
was
also
more
aware
of
how
I
constructed
my
English
analysis
as
well
D
I
began
to
write
by
describing
a
certain
scene
in
a
novel,
then
explaining
its
meaning
through
a
particular
theoretical
lens.
The
benefits
between
the
two
classes
were
unsurprising
since
I
often
thought
of
them
as
the
same
work
only
in
different
languages.
Not
only
did
my
skill
at
literary
writing
increase,
but
also
my
appreciation
and
ability
at
scientific
writing.
My
Psychology
class
offered
me
the
next
big
challenge
in
science
since
ninth
grade
physics.
Lab
reports
were
a
large
part
of
the
grade,
and
the
only
way
to
get
an
A
was
to
master
the
writing
of
scientific
discourse.
Unlike
an
English
essay,
a
psychological
lab
report
was
highly
structured.
It
had
four
parts,
each
written
in
a
different
style
and
for
different
audiences.
Looking
at
them
separately,
I
was
able
to
find
many
similarities
to
other
kinds
of
writing
in
my
past.
For
example,
the
use
of
background
research
in
the
introduction
required
the
same
research
skills
as
gathering
quotes
for
a
research
paper.
All
parts
of
the
report
were
also
to
be
written
in
paragraph
form,
and
much
like
an
essay
it
had
to
make
sense
as
I
built
a
case
in
the
introduction
and
resolved
my
findings
in
the
conclusion.
The
type
of
logic
may
have
been
more
clear
cut,
but
the
demand
for
relevant
evidence
was
shared
across
disciplines.
My
history
with
writing
appeared
to
be
something
of
a
roller
coaster
ride
(if
I
can
beg
forgiveness
for
the
clich).
I
started
out
on
top
for
I
loved
reading
and
the
many
ways
language
was
able
to
convey
meaning.
I
clung
to
my
enjoyment
by
writing
about
things
I
liked
in
my
everyday
life
outside
school
and
what
I
considered
Nwriting.O
When
I
hit
high
school,
I
plummeted
and
came
to
loathe
writing.
My
teacher
always
gave
me
bad
grades
and
I
was
forced
to
write
in
a
style
that
none
of
my
interests
could
have
made
bearable.
Eventually,
as
my
academic
interests
matured
and
I
was
released
from
the
grips
of
the
proof
paragraph,
my
love
of
writing
blossomed
anew.
With
a
new
understanding
of
writing,
as
a
medium
of
culture,
I
began
to
love
language
and
writing
for
itself.
Each
experience
I
had
with
writing
fortified
an
intrigue
into
every
facet
of
language
and
taught
