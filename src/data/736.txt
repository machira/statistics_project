My
History
as
a
Writer:
From
Childhood
to
Today
My
first
experiences
with
writing
took
place
in
preschool
and
kindergarten.
Along
with
the
other
members
of
my
class,
I
would
write
sentences
and
match
them
to
pictures
of
everyday
activities
or
directives
commonly
issued
to
young
children,
such
as
washing
hands.
These
early
exercises
helped
me
to
gain
a
stronger
grasp
of
the
English
language
and
prepared
me
for
enriching
writing
projects
in
years
to
come.
From
the
second
to
fifth
grades,
Nschool
writingO
became
more
complex,
and
I
began
to
prepare
short
narratives
entitled
NWhat
I
did
last
weekendO
and
NHow
I
spent
my
summer.O
My
parents
always
encouraged
and
helped
me
when
needed,
and
teachers
asked
me
follow-up
questions
when
I
read
the
pieces
aloud
in
class.
Gradually,
I
began
to
develop
an
appreciation
for
writing
as
a
tool
for
communication.
As
a
writer,
I
could
reach
an
audience
with
details
about
my
day-to-day
experiences,
friends,
and
family.
Through
each
assignment,
I
began
to
learn
that
an
intriguing
Nhook,O
varying
sentence
structures,
and
a
compelling
conclusion
would
interest
others
in
what
I
had
to
say.
This
basic
foundation
allowed
me
to
successfully
tackle
more
abstract
and
technical
forms
of
writing
in
years
to
come.
In
the
fourth
grade,
my
teacher,
Miss
Yavorski,
presented
our
class
with
the
most
in-depth
writing
project
thus
far:
together,
we
would
create
a
Nliving
museum.O
Each
student
was
asked
to
choose
a
notable
person
in
history
(I
chose
Emily
Dickinson)
and
prepare
a
first-person
dialogue
covering
the
details
of
his
or
her
life.
On
the
day
of
the
museum,
each
student
dressed
up
as
the
person
and
recited
the
memorized
report.
Not
only
was
this
my
first
research
project,
but
it
was
also
my
first
truly
interactive
writing
experience.
By
memorizing
a
short
summary
of
Emily
DickinsonOs
life,
dressing
as
her,
and
essentially
becoming
the
reclusive
nineteenth-century
poet,
I
had
an
unprecedented
experience
with
writing.
At
age
ten,
I
gained
the
understanding
that
while
writing
could
help
me
communicate
my
personal
beliefs
and
life
experiences
effectively
to
others,
I
could
also
become
an
entirely
different
person
through
writing.
In
the
sixth
and
seventh
grades,
I
had
excellent
English
teachers.
Mrs.
Dicciani
put
an
emphasis
on
the
writerOs
notebook,
and
our
first
assignment
for
the
year
was
to
decorate
both
a
readerOs
and
writerOs
notebook
with
pictures,
stickers,
and
other
images
or
words
that
effectively
captured
the
writerOs
personality-
his
or
her
loved
ones,
hopes,
dreams,
and
beliefs.
By
separating
entries
into
distinct
readerOs
and
writerOs
notebooks,
I
began
to
distinguish
the
inextricable
link
between
the
twin
pursuits
of
reading
and
writing:
reading
new
books
and
authors
improved
my
writing,
while
writing
in
different
genres
and
styles
enhanced
my
ability
to
pick
up
on
subtleties
while
reading.
The
next
year,
in
Mrs.
WellsO
class,
I
delved
into
poetry,
and
a
few
of
my
best
poems
were
published
in
the
middle
schoolOs
Creative
Forum
magazine.
I
had
developed
a
distinctive
talent
for
writing
by
this
time,
and
many
of
my
classmates
came
to
me
for
help
with
their
school
assignments.
I
enjoyed
looking
over
their
rough
drafts
and
offering
constructive
criticism,
and
am
very
happy
to
be
taking
on
that
role
once
again
as
a
Writing
Associate.
Mrs.
Wells
and
I
connected
through
reading
as
well,
and
she
and
I
discussed
themes
in
some
of
my
favorite
novels.
In
my
junior
year
of
high
school,
I
made
the
decision
to
take
Advanced
Placement
English,
and
this
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
best
academic
experiences
of
my
high
school
career.
The
teacher,
Dr.
Walters,
was
close
to
his
fiftieth
year
of
teaching
English.
He
and
his
quirks
had
become
something
a
legend
throughout
the
school
and
even
the
district.
His
classroom,
for
instance,
was
nicknamed
the
NWalterian
Wonderland,O
and
he
had
an
extensive
mug
collection
in
his
closet.
More
importantly,
however,
his
class
was
an
incredibly
valuable
and
extensive
survey
of
literature
which
inspired
me
to
become
an
English
major
in
college.
I
still
have
the
NWalterian
poetry
packetO
that
we
studied
that
year,
and
many
of
the
techniques
for
reading
and
writing
that
I
learned
in
his
classroom
have
been
useful
in
my
college
courses.
My
final
formative
experience
with
writing
in
high
school
took
place
in
Advanced
Placement
Spanish
literature,
where
I
experienced
a
second
language
in
a
much
deeper,
more
intensive
way
than
I
had
since
beginning
to
learn
Spanish.
Rather
than
merely
learning
the
rudiments
of
the
language,
my
classmates
and
I
read
and
analyzed
short
stories
by
Gabriel
Garca
Marquez,
Carmen
Martn
Gaite,
and
other
influential
Latin
American
authors.
This
was
probably
one
of
my
most
challenging
writing
experiences
thus
far,
but
it
proved
to
be
very
rewarding.
I
am
considering
a
minor
in
Spanish
at
Lafayette,
and
I
am
grateful
to
have
the
skill
of
reading
and
writing
a
second
language.
At
Lafayette,
one
of
my
memorable
writing
experiences
was
part
of
the
History
of
the
Holocaust
class
that
I
took
during
the
spring
semester.
The
major
assignment
for
the
class
was
a
15-20
page
research
paper
dealing
with
any
topic
relating
to
the
Holocaust.
This
was
my
first
real
college-level
research
paper,
and
completing
such
a
huge
project
over
the
course
of
an
entire
semester
gave
me
a
great
sense
of
accomplishment.
I
had
successfully
researched
on
a
college
level.
This
semester,
I
will
be
taking
a
Creative
Writing
class,
so
by
December
I
will
have
done
both
research
and
creative
writing
on
a
college
level.
My
journey
as
a
writer
has
thus
far
been
a
long
and
fulfilling
one,
and
I
am
very
excited
to
begin
the
next
step
by
assisting
other
students
on
their
own
literary
journeys.
