New
Writing
Associate
Literacy
Assignment
In
first
grade
I
learned
to
read
and
write.
Though
I
picked
up
both
reading
and
writing
quickly,
I
found
that
while
I
greatly
enjoyed
reading,
I
did
not
enjoy
writing
at
all.
To
help
our
class
practice
writing,
my
teacher
set
aside
a
period
of
time
each
day
so
that
we
could
keep
"logs"
of
our
activities
at
school
and
at
home.
I
found
this
exercise
to
be
boring
and
pointless.
To
get
the
dreadful
writing
over
with
quickly,
I
would
write
in
extremely
large
letters,
sometimes
two
or
three
lines
tall
and
only
two
words
to
a
line.
My
entries
tended
to
read
something
like:
"Today
we
colored.
It
was
fun
fun
fun
fun."
I
remember
being
very
surprised
and
disappointed
when
my
teacher
caught
on
to
my
clever
trick
and
informed
me
that
one
"fun"
would
suffice.
My
second
and
third
grade
teachers
had
us
write
the
mandatory
"what
I
did
over
my
summer
vacation"
essay,
but
no
other
memorable
writing
ensued.
These
essays
were
written
on
flimsy
green
paper
that
was
intended
to
help
students
form
letters
with
the
widely
spaced
lines.
This
paper
inevitably
tore
when
we
tried
to
erase
our
mistakes
with
the
huge
rubber
erasers
we
were
given
to
use.
In
third
grade
we
learned
to
write
in
cursive,
but
we
were
not
given
any
writing
assignments.
We
just
practiced
our
letters.
Between
third
and
fourth
grade
I
moved
to
a
different
school
which,
though
it
was
in
the
same
district,
taught
much
more
writing
than
did
my
first
school.
My
fourth
grade
class
was
my
first
introduction
to
creative
writing.
Though
up
to
this
point
I
had
enjoyed
reading
almost
every
book
I
could
get
my
hands
on,
my
writing
experiences
had
been
limited
to
journals
and
essays.
I
remember
how
pleased
I
was
when
blank
notebooks
were
distributed
to
the
class
and
we
were
told
that
for
the
next
half-hour
we
were
to
write
about
anything
we
wanted.
I
started
writing
a
story
about
a
dog
who
was
lost
in
a
city
on
Christmas
Eve
and
was
really
getting
into
the
tale
when
the
teacher
told
us
it
was
time
to
move
on
to
another
subject.
The
next
day
when
we
got
our
books
back
the
teacher
had
written
that
she
was
interested
in
the
story
and
looked
forward
to
hearing
what
would
happen
next.
I
wrote
a
little
more
about
the
dog
over
the
next
few
days,
but
the
stop
and
go
nature
of
our
assignment
did
not
appeal
to
me.
I
eventually
lost
interest
in
the
story
and
dashed
off
a
quick
ending
which
did
not
really
go
with
the
rest
of
the
story.
Later
in
the
year
we
were
all
told
to
write
a
topic
for
a
story
on
a
strip
of
paper
and
put
that
topic
in
a
hat.
We
then
each
picked
one
of
the
topics.
Mine
was
"The
day
my
sister
put
glue
in
the
shampoo."
We
were
told
to
create
a
story
with
our
topics
as
the
titles.
Though
I
much
preferred
this
writing
to
the
"log"
or
"what
I
did
over
my
summer
vacation"
essay,
I
wished
that
I
might
be
allowed
to
write
again
on
my
own
topic.
The
next
year,
in
fifth
grade
we
took
the
creative
writing
a
step
further
and
started
creating
our
own
books.
We
were
given
longer
periods
of
time
in
which
to
write
our
stories,
which
helped
me
stay
interested
in
my
book.
After
we
finished
our
stories
we
went
through
a
revision
process
which
involved
our
peers
and
our
teacher.
Once
our
stories
were
revised
we
mapped
our
books
out
with
little
storyboards.
Only
when
these
steps
were
completed
could
we
start
our
books.
These
first
books
consisted
of
large
pieces
of
construction
paper,
which
were
stapled
together,
but
we
were
thrilled
with
them.
We
carefully
printed
our
well-revised
stories
into
our
books,
then
added
colorful
illustrations.
The
finished
product
was
something
of
which
we
could
truly
be
proud.
The
project
had
been
such
a
success
for
the
class
that
the
teacher
decided
that
we
should
do
another
similar
project.
This
time
however,
she
got
a
supply
of
blank
white
hardcover
books
in
which
we
could
put
our
stories.
We
each
created
a
new
story
and
put
it
through
an
even
more
rigorous
revision
process
than
before.
This
time
we
were
even
more
careful
that
our
handwriting
be
neat,
and
our
illustrations
be
carefully
colored.
We
knew
that
any
mistakes
we
made
in
these
books
could
not
be
corrected.
Finally
we
each
had
a
book
that
we
had
written
and
illustrated
all
by
ourselves.
Much
as
we
enjoyed
these
projects,
we
never
got
a
chance
to
write
another
book.
In
sixth
grade
we
did
very
little
writing,
and
I
started
to
associate
writing
only
with
spelling
which
was
never
my
forte.
We
read
several
books
in
that
class,
and
answered
questions
about
the
books
in
workbooks,
but
we
didn't
write
anything
of
substance.
I
entered
junior
high
school
without
the
love
of
writing
that
had
blossomed
in
my
fifth
grade
class.
In
seventh
grade
when
the
teacher
announced
that
we
each
had
to
write
a
15-page
story,
I
was
dismayed.
Fifteen
pages
seemed
to
be
beyond
the
possible.
I
was
sure
that
writing
anything
as
long
as
15
pages
would
probably
kill
any
normal
human
being.
Though
I
put
off
the
writing
of
the
story
as
long
as
I
could,
finally
with
the
deadline
for
the
story
approaching
and
only
a
slight
idea
of
how
the
story
would
go,
I
made
myself
sit
down
and
write.
I
found
that
the
hardest
part
of
writing
the
story
was
naming
the
characters,
from
that
point
on
the
story
took
on
a
life
of
its
own
and
practically
wrote
itself.
I
found
that,
though
I
really
didn't
know
what
was
going
to
happen
beyond
the
first
page
or
so
of
the
story,
it
seemed
to
progress
logically
from
the
first
few
words,
and
that
from
time
to
time
the
characters
would
say
things
that
surprised
even
me!
I
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
when
I
finished
the
story
and
discovered
that
I
had
somehow
survived
15
pages
of
writing
with
no
obvious
ill
effects.
When
our
teacher
returned
our
papers
she
announced
to
us
that
there
was
a
school-wide
writing
contest
and
we
were
all
welcome
to
enter
our
stories
to
try
to
win
the
$35
prize.
I
entered
and
on
the
last
day
of
school
I
waited
anxiously
through
the
first
part
of
the
school
award
ceremony.
After
all
of
the
perfect
attendance
awards
had
been
distributed,
and
the
school's
prize
athlete
had
been
commended,
the
winner
of
the
writing
contest
was
announced.
Not
surprisingly
an
older,
8
grade
student
had
won
the
contest.
I
was
very
disappointed,
but
not
for
long.
Later
in
the
ceremony
another
award
was
announced.
This
award
was
one
of
which
I
had
not
been
aware.
This
"writing
award"
was
a
medal
distributed
to
one
student
in
each
class,
and
I
was
one
of
the
winners!
Not
only
had
I
survived
my
15
page
assignment,
I
had
won
a
medal
for
it.
In
eighth
grade
our
big
writing
assignment
was
a
15
to
20-page
mystery.
Now
that
I
knew
that
I
could
survive
a
15-page
paper
I
had
a
chance
to
look
forward
to
and
map
out
my
story.
I
really
enjoyed
writing
this
story.
I
included
horses
and
cats
about
which
I
knew
much,
and
I
even
based
my
characters
on
people
I
knew.
I
found
that
this
made
the
characters
more
realistic
and
more
fun
to
write.
Again
the
story
seemed
to
write
itself,
though
this
time
I
had
at
least
some
idea
of
the
ending
before
I
started
the
story.
I
felt
very
good
about
my
story
when
I
turned
it
in,
but
when
we
got
the
papers
back
my
teacher
started
raving
about
the
paper
written
by
the
girl
seated
next
to
me.
She
announced
to
the
class
that
that
girl
had
written
a
wonderful
story,
and
she
simply
had
to
enter
it
into
the
writing
contest.
After
this
wonderful
review,
I
knew
that
the
girl
next
to
me
would
not
only
get
the
writing
award
for
our
class,
but
she
would
also
win
the
writing
contest.
I
nearly
didn't
enter
the
contest,
but
finally
I
decided
that
it
couldn't
hurt
to
enter,
on
the
off
chance
that
I
would
get
an
honorable
mention.
The
day
of
the
award
ceremony
I
had
my
fingers
crossed
tightly.
Finally
the
announcer
got
to
the
writing
contest
winners.
She
announced
the
second
runner
up...
not
me.
Then
she
announced
the
first
runner
up...
also
not
me.
Since
I
knew
that
the
girl
who
had
sat
next
to
me
in
English
would
win
the
award,
especially
since
she
wasn't
a
runner
up,
I
was
extremely
disappointed.
The
next
instant
I
heard
the
announcer
say
my
name.
It
took
me
a
moment
to
realize
that
she
had
announced
that
I
was
the
winner
of
the
writing
contest!
This
greatly
encouraged
my
love
of
writing
and
as
I
entered
high
school,
I
no
longer
dreaded
our
writing
assignments.
Though
I
expected
that
high
school
English
would
bring
longer
and
more
difficult
writing
assignments,
it
did
not.
I
believe
that
we
wrote
short
and
not
very
memorable
research
papers,
because
I
remember
learning
how
to
document
sources,
and
typing
our
papers
on
ancient
Apple
computers.
The
only
other
writing
I
recall
doing
in
that
English
class
is
writing
up
fake
horoscopes
to
print
in
a
mock
Elizabethan
newspaper
which
was
a
sister
assignment
to
our
introduction
to
Shakespeare.
As
it
turned
out
we
ended
up
doing
much
more
writing
in
our
world
cultures
class
than
we
did
in
our
English
class.
In
this
class
we
each
thoroughly
researched
a
country
(mine
was
Canada),
and
wrote
papers
which
included
the
past,
present,
and
future
of
our
countries.
At
the
time
Quebec
was
considering
separating
from
Canada
so
I
had
to
research
the
possible
side
effects
of
the
separation
and
explain
whether
it
would
be
a
good
or
bad
move.
This
was
the
first
major
research
paper
that
I
had
written,
and
I
found
it
to
be
a
very
educational
experience.
In
tenth
grade
our
major
English
writing
assignment
was
to
write
an
"argumentative
essay."
We
had
to
pick
a
topic
and
convince
the
reader
that
our
view
on
the
issue
was
the
correct
view.
When
we
completed
our
papers
we
had
to
hand
them
to
our
classmates
and
they
were
to
write
their
comments
at
the
end
of
the
paper.
Our
grade
was
based
not
only
on
the
teacher's
assessment,
but
also
on
those
of
the
students.
In
eleventh
grade
English,
the
entire
class
was
geared
toward
an
all-encompassing
project
that
included
writing,
speaking
and
research.
We
were
each
to
pick
a
flower
and
write
a
number
of
different
short
essays
on
different
aspects
of
the
flower.
The
topics
for
these
essays
spanned
everything
from
where
we
first
encountered
the
flower
to
the
agricultural
needs
of
the
plant.
Near
the
end
of
the
year
we
combined
these
papers
into
one
long
paper
which,
accompanied
by
an
oral
presentation,
constituted
most
of
that
quarter's
grade.
Between
eleventh
and
twelfth
grades
I
again
changed
schools,
but
this
time
I
also
changed
districts.
In
my
new
school
I
found
the
writing
assignments
to
be
easy
and
rather
pointless.
I
found
that
other
students
had
great
trouble
with
assignments
that
I
thought
were
rather
simple.
We
wrote
a
number
of
short
papers,
mostly
reactions
to
things
we
had
read
in
class.
I
thought
that
the
most
enjoyable
assignment
was
when
we
were
told
to
write
a
short
satire
similar
to
one
of
the
stories
in
Gulliver's
Travels.
I
found
that
none
of
these
papers
required
the
revision
process
that
I
had
learned
in
my
other
school.
The
biggest
advantage
of
the
school
change,
as
far
as
my
writing
was
concerned,
was
that
in
this
new
school
I
had
a
lot
of
free
time.
I
had
several
study
halls
in
my
schedule
and
very
little
homework.
I
found
that
a
wonderful
way
to
fill
my
free
time
was
to
write.
This
free
time
let
me
explore
creative
writing
again.
Though
I
hadn't
done
much
creative
writing
since
junior
high
school,
I
found
it
quite
enjoyable.
I
finally
had
a
chance
to
write
more
short
stories
and
for
the
first
time
I
experimented
with
poetry.
When
I
came
to
Lafayette
I
found
that
the
papers
that
I
wrote
were
much
more
challenging
than
were
those
that
I
had
written
in
my
senior
year
of
high
school.
These
papers
were
not
only
longer,
but
they
also
required
a
great
deal
of
research.
I
also
had
to
change
the
way
in
which
I
wrote
my
papers.
In
high
school,
especially
in
my
senior
year,
I
rarely
had
to
rewrite,
or
revise
my
papers
more
then
once,
but
in
college
I
found
that
it
was
not
unusual
for
me
to
revise
my
papers
several
times.
I
found
that
each
time
I
reread
my
papers
I
would
find
something
that
could
be
fixed,
or
at
least
improved.
I
also
discovered
that
I
was
much
more
likely
to
find
these
errors
if
I
printed
out
a
copy
of
my
paper
rather
than
just
reading
it
on
the
computer.
Over
the
course
of
my
education,
my
writing
has
evolved
greatly.
Far
from
the
little
girl
who
tried
to
trick
her
way
out
of
writing
assignments,
I
now
eagerly
anticipate
writing
in
the
future,
both
in
and
out
of
school.
