Returning
WA
Essay
Writing
as
a
WA,
writing
as
a
student,
writing
as
a
professor,
writing
as
a
technical
professional.
My
second
year
as
a
WA
was
an
exercise
in
determining
and
establishing
algorithms
for
each
category.
Over
the
course
of
this
past
year,
both
my
writing
assignments
and
those
of
my
WA
students
were
often
filled
with
many
restrictions
on
form
and
style.
With
such
strict
guidelines,
individual
professorsO
wishes
and
the
extent
to
which
students
understood
requirements
were
often
as
important
as
the
quality
of
information
included.
Therefore,
as
a
writer
I
had
to
overcome
my
own
frustration
in
the
tedious
nature
of
assignments
and
as
a
WA
I
had
to
inspire
students
to
do
the
same.
While
attempting
to
accomplish
this
goal,
I
noticed
that
students
frequently
underestimate
their
ability
(both
as
writers
and
learners)
and
professors
frequently
overestimate
their
ability
(both
as
writers
and
teachers).
This
leaves
the
WA
to
overcome
and
mediate
this
reality,
while
at
the
same
time
questioning
her
own
ability
as
a
writer
and
student
professional.
Although
this
past
year
was
a
year
offered
challenges,
I
learned
a
great
deal
about
the
finer
points
of
being
a
successful
WA
and
developed
a
stronger
ability
as
a
writer
to
focus
on
style,
audience,
and
other
details
necessary
to
produce
better
non-fiction
writing.
WA
assignments
always
give
me
the
opportunity
to
expand
my
writing
horizons,
however
this
year
I
gained
satisfaction
from
the
diversity
my
WA
assignments
offered
my
educational
experience
in
general.
During
the
fall
of
2002,
I
was
the
WA
for
an
introduction
to
political
theory
course.
This
was
an
exciting
opportunity
since
before
receiving
the
assignment,
the
only
background
I
had
in
the
field
was
based
on
overviews
of
political
systems
presented
briefly
in
past
philosophy
courses.
Spring
2003
I
was
both
excited
and
nervous
to
be
assigned
to
WA
for
biomedical
physics,
a
course
that
offered
me
an
opportunity
to
become
interested
in
a
subject
I
generally
disliked.
Since
my
own
writing
assignments
consisted
of
almost
entirely
lab
reports
that
must
adhere
to
very
restricting
stylistic
guidelines
and
topics,
my
WA
assignments
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
exercise
more
of
my
brain.
Confusion
breads
creativity
and
critical
thought.
This
was
the
professorOs
method
behind
the
madness
of
introduction
to
political
theory.
Although
he
confessed
to
creating
confusion,
it
became
evident
that
neither
confusion
nor
uninvited
creativity
won
high
grades
in
his
class.
He
would
not
answer
student
questions
and
often
admittedly
misdirected
students
in
order
to
create
an
environment
of
stress
and
ultimately
critical
thinking.
However,
many
freshmen
experiencing
college
writing
for
the
first
time
in
his
course
did
not
appreciate
nor
flourish
from
the
confusion
approach.
This
led
me,
as
the
WA,
to
be
an
interpreter,
liaison,
and
advocate
for
both
student
and
professor.
At
times,
it
was
stressful
to
all
involved
since
I
was
a
newcomer
to
the
field
explaining
techniques
and
concepts
I
had
yet
to
master
myself.
I
asked
the
professor
for
examples
and
even
submitted
snippets
of
my
own
writing
to
verify
I
had
the
correct
idea
before
venturing
into
conferences
that
often
cornered
me
into
teaching
more
then
listening.
Although
challenging,
the
process
improved
my
abilities
as
a
WA
because
I
had
to
constantly
strive
to
find
new
techniques
to
elicit
questions
and
cooperation
from
frustrated
students.
In
doing
so,
I
had
to
find
many
different
ways
to
monitor
the
amount
of
instructing
I
was
doing
in
order
to
decrease
studentsO
reluctance
to
participate.
While
I
suspected
my
work
as
a
WA
first
semester
was
beneficial
to
the
political
theory
students,
I
later
discovered
the
whole
process
of
decoding
expectations
was
also
extremely
beneficial
to
myself
as
a
college
writer.
When
preparing
for
conferences
during
the
fall,
I
was
forced
to
ascertain
exactly
what
the
professor
wanted
from
his
students
after
a
15-minute
meeting.
Consequently,
I
learned
to
prepare
for
meetings,
ask
precise
questions,
read
between
the
lines,
and
decipher
his
grading
strategy
in
order
to
better
assist
the
students.
When
writing
a
paper
for
a
philosophy
course
I
had
the
same
semester,
I
found
all
of
these
skills
to
be
extremely
helpful
when
meeting
with
my
philosophy
professor
to
discuss
the
assignment
and
my
own
writing
for
the
course.
It
suddenly
became
easier
to
address
the
topic
in
the
proper
format
while
throwing
in
those
small
stylistic
additives
some
professors
expect.
While
this
experience
did
not
change
my
writing
style
per
say,
it
definitely
helped
me
to
improve
my
professor
interpretation
and
stylistic
tailoring
skills
immensely.
My
experiences
with
the
political
theory
course
also
made
me
think
critically
about
the
need
for
a
specific
format
and
style.
Why
are
professors
often
so
concerned
with
contour
over
content?
What
purpose
does
it
serve
and
do
I
worry
about
it
enough
as
a
writer?
I
started
to
become
extremely
style
critical,
especially
of
papers
for
which
professors
did
not
prescribe
a
specific
style.
Did
that
mean
that
style
and
format
were
not
as
important
in
such
a
case,
or
was
it
equally
as
important
and
I
was
responsible
for
finding
my
own?
In
addition
to
making
me
more
critical
of
my
own
writing,
Fall
2002
taught
me
the
importance
of
working
together
as
a
WA
staff.
Since
there
were
two
large
sections
of
the
class,
there
were
three
WAOs
assigned
to
the
course.
Both
of
the
other
women
working
with
the
students
had
taken
the
course
in
the
past
and
had
extensive
experience
dealing
with
the
professor.
Since
I
had
not
taken
the
course
and
constant
communication
with
the
professor
was
not
realistic,
their
experience
and
advice
was
valuable.
Since
meeting
times
frequently
coordinated,
students
often
had
the
benefit
of
receiving
information
and
an
ear
from
both
Jen
Conway
and
myself.
The
dynamics
of
the
three
WAOs
working
together
on
the
course
was
also
interesting.
Although
we
were
all
friendly,
equal,
and
cooperative,
a
natural
pecking
order
developed.
Mother
bee
was
the
WA
that
had
both
experience
as
a
WA
and
significant
experience
in
the
field
and
working
with
the
professor,
while
myself
who
had
experience
as
a
WA
but
not
in
the
field
fell
under
her,
and
the
third
WA
with
experience
in
the
field
but
no
WA
experience
fell
under
me.
Quickly
a
professional
relationship
in
which
we
assisted
and
compensated
for
each
other
developed.
It
was
the
first
time
I
had
the
experience
of
having
another
WA
with
which
to
discuss
specific
issues
related
directly
to
the
conferences
and
paper
topics.
It
was
extremely
helpful
and
therefore,
one
of
my
primary
pieces
of
advice
to
new
WAOs
is
to
not
be
afraid
to
ask
questions
of
other
WAOs
that
may
have
experience
with
either
the
professor
or
the
class.
In
fact
it
may
be
very
helpful
if
at
the
first
few
meetings
a
list
of
classes
was
passed
around
and
anyone
that
has
been
a
WA
for
the
class,
taken
the
class
as
a
student,
or
has
extensive
knowledge
of
the
professor
sign
his
or
her
name
as
a
specific
mentor
for
a
WA
assignment.
Even
if
this
is
not
a
program
wide
goal,
I
know
that
I
will
make
it
a
personal
goal
to
better
use
my
fellow
WAOs
as
resources
when
dealing
with
new
or
unfamiliar
assignments.
In
terms
of
conducting
conferences,
fall
of
2002
also
presented
me
with
a
new
experience
as
a
WA.
I
had
one
student
in
particular
who
was
very
intellectually
challenging,
and
therefore
affected
the
way
I
approached
conferences.
I
would
become
very
nervous
before
conferences
since
I
knew
my
ability,
confidence,
and
authority
would
be
tested.
Although
meetings
were
intimidating,
conferences
with
this
particular
student
always
went
well
because
he
was
very
engaged
and
came
prepared
to
do
most
of
the
talking
and
questioning.
However,
there
were
times
when
I
did
not
feel
prepared
or
qualified
to
answer
some
his
questions
since
his
writing
was
of
an
extremely
high
quality
and
his
understanding
of
the
subject
was
strong.
His
conferences
forced
me
to
constantly
confirm
my
role
as
a
peer
and
not
a
tutor
or
teacher.
They
also
forced
me
to
speak
and
reply
more
precisely
and
carefully
during
conferences.
Often
throughout
the
semester
at
staff
meetings,
we
discussed
how
much
WAOs
learn
from
students
in
addition
to
how
much
students
learn
from
WAOs.
This
young
man
from
the
political
theory
class
was
the
first
student
from
whom
I
felt
like
I
definitely
gained
a
world
of
experience
and
knowledge.
Working
with
other
students
before
this
experience,
I
never
had
a
difficult
time
establishing
authority.
However,
with
this
particular
student
that
greatly
challenged
my
ability
as
a
writer
and
as
a
WA,
I
began
to
question
the
authority
I
had
established
with
other
students;
I
began
to
wonder
if
there
were
other
situations
in
which
I
had
assumed
a
certain
level
of
authority
I
did
not
deserve.
So
my
advice
to
new
WAOsNremember
just
because
you
are
a
WA
does
not
mean
the
person
sitting
at
the
table
with
you
would
not
be
as
equally
qualified
to
do
your
job.
Therefore,
you
must
treat
everyone
with
the
intellectual
respect
they
deserve.
(DonOt
worry;
I
tried
to
encourage
this
student
to
apply
to
be
a
part
of
the
program.
Unfortunately,
it
was
not
an
opportunity
in
which
he
was
interested).
In
contrast
with
the
form
of
the
fall,
Spring
of
2003
I
was
the
WA
for
a
professor
with
little
structure
to
his
writing
assignments,
giving
the
students
free
reign
as
to
how
they
chose
to
format
their
papers.
As
a
WA
for
biomedical
physics,
I
reentered
an
area
of
study
with
which
I
am
comfortable.
Because
of
this,
I
found
the
opportunity
to
read
in
depth
investigations
into
one
topic
an
exciting
addition
to
the
physics
course
I
took
concurrently
with
the
same
professor.
Although
sometimes
being
a
WA
for
a
professor
you
currently
have
for
a
different
course
can
be
both
convenient
and
challenging
in
different
ways,
the
professor
was
open
minded
and
easy
going.
I
had
a
large
amount
of
freedom
to
run
the
paper
revision
process
how
I
saw
fit.
The
professor
expected
me
to
set
draft
due
dates
and
meeting
weeks.
However,
the
freedom
the
professor
allowed
eventually
turned
out
to
be
more
of
a
curse
than
a
blessing.
Since
the
professor
had
never
taught
a
writing
course
before,
the
WA/professor
dynamic
was
slightly
altered
for
this
assignment.
He
relied
on
me
to
explain
the
program
to
both
him
and
the
class,
enforce
policy,
and
be
extremely
self-motivated
in
monitoring
the
status
of
the
studentsO
progress.
The
power
dynamic
became
even
more
interesting
as
he
began
to
struggle
as
a
professor
of
writing
and
I
began
to
struggle
in
the
class
for
which
he
was
my
professor.
He
was
always
available
to
help
students,
but
since
he
was
not
sure
himself
what
he
wanted,
information
was
often
relayed
differently
to
different
parties.
In
terms
of
my
own
writing,
my
WA
work
that
semester
made
me
excited
to
see
less
formatted
assignments.
I
realized
how
much
intellectual
freedom
was
granted
to
these
students
and
started
to
strive
to
establish
my
own
realm
of
intellectual
freedom
in
my
other
classes.
I
was
forced
to
take
such
initiative
to
successfully
complete
this
WA
assignment,
that
the
same
level
of
initiative
transferred
to
my
own
writing.
From
meeting
with
him,
I
learned
the
importance
of
embracing
something
that
turns
you
on
intellectually
and
running
with
it.
He
was
so
genuinely
excited
to
read
what
the
students
had
written
that
it
made
me
just
as
excited
to
read
my
peersO
writing
in
order
to
learn
what
they
were
learning.
Since
he
was
interesting
in
learning
information,
he
was
very
content
critical.
So
as
opposed
to
first
semester,
my
task
was
to
discuss
mostly
the
quality
of
information
presentation.
Discussing
papers
following
his
desires
made
me
focus
solely
on
content
and
clarity.
This
need
for
precision
and
interesting
information
infiltrated
my
writing.
Overall,
second
semester
taught
me
to
be
greedy
for
knowledge
and
take
initiative
to
make
my
writing
clear
yet
intriguing.
From
my
WA
experience
second
semester,
I
also
learned
that
sometimes
it
just
takes
a
little
more
effort
to
make
the
program
successful.
Dealing
with
a
professor
that
was
forgetful
and
often
a
little
lost
on
dates,
I
found
myself
attending
the
class
to
supervise
conference
sign-ups
and
expectations
for
the
round
of
conferences.
He
also
had
no
drafting
policy,
so
I
was
responsible
for
checking
up
on
studentsO
progress
and
encouraging
timely
revisions
on
the
major
semester-long
assignment.
Therefore,
my
advice
to
new
WAOs
based
on
this
experience
is
that
professor
leadership
is
expected,
but
definitely
not
guaranteed.
Therefore,
there
may
be
certain
WA
assignments
for
which
you
must
put
forth
extra
organizational
effort
in
order
to
better
complete
the
conference
portion
of
the
job.
While
no
significant
writing
milestones
or
revolutions
have
occurred
so
far
this
summer,
my
contemplation
of
ideas
presented
by
Tom
Wolfe
in
his
book
Hooking
Up
have
changed
the
way
I
perceive
the
purpose
of
writing.
He
spends
a
great
deal
of
time
discussing
the
need
for
writing
to
capture
life;
the
world
provides
an
incredible
amount
of
material
for
writers
to
discover
and
depict.
Although
he
is
a
journalist
advocating
his
trade,
he
inspired
me
to
realize
there
is
still
a
place
for
writing
in
a
pop
culture
society.
The
book
also
prompted
me
to
think
about
genres
and
techniques
of
writing
over
the
summer
(which
is
not
generally
typical
practice).
Thinking
about
writing
over
the
summer
has
left
me
anxious
to
return
in
the
fall
to
take
creative
writing
and
explore
topics
in
writing
on
which
my
WA
experience
may
not
have
touched.
Hopefully,
I
will
attempt
this
task
with
all
the
variety
and
excitement
of
a
good
drop-in
conference.
