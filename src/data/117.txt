Writing
Associate
Paper
A
Work
in
Progress
The
earliest
memories
of
writing
I
have
are
from
the
early
years
of
elementary
school.
I
fondly
remember
writing
in
personal
journals
and
writing
short
stories
throughout
elementary
school.
I
always
enjoyed
journal
time
because
it
was
a
quite
time
to
write
about
things
that
were
important
to
me
at
that
time.
I
am
sure
that
the
subjects
of
my
journal
entries
were
not
ponderings
of
world
occurrences.
Rather,
they
were
probably
topics
such
as
the
girl
I
had
a
crush
on,
or
what
happened
at
recess
the
previous
day.
Journal
entries
allowed
me
to
express
my
personal
feelings
in
writing.
Personal
feelings
about
a
subject
are
the
building
block
of
writing
a
paper
so
it
is
appropriate
that
my
first
memories
of
writing
were
of
such
a
personal
nature.
On
the
other
hand,
writing
short
stories
allowed
me
to
use
my
imagination.
I
recall
that
I
loved
to
right
fairy
tails
about
make
believe
worlds
where
giants
lived.
Unfortunately
imagination
is
something
we
lose
sight
of
in
our
writing
at
the
college
level.
I
know
I
should
consider
lookback
to
my
early
writings
for
inspiration
and
try
to
incorporate
more
imagination.
Elementary
school
was
also
an
important
time
in
my
writing
experience
because
it
was
the
beginning
of
learning
sentence
structure.
I
remember
Studying
grammar
and
working
on
the
structure
of
a
sentence.
I
hated
everything
that
had
to
do
with
grammar
but
it
was
an
essential
factor
in
the
development
of
my
writing
because,
like
the
sentence
itself,
it
was
the
basis
upon
which
all
of
my
writing
ability
has
been
based.
I
realize
now
that
my
earliest
attempts
at
writing
influence
the
way
I
write
today.
Elementary
school
is
where
I
developed
an
imagination
and
learned
how
to
write
in
sentences.
As
I
began
to
grasp
the
rudiments
of
writing,
teachers
asked
me
to
move
away
from
writing
about
feelings
and
concentrate
on
the
facts.
Research
papers
and
book
reports
became
the
norm.
Unfortunately
there
was
not
much
thinking
involved
when
writing
papers
in
these
genres
but
there
was
still
that
I
gained
from
writing
in
an
informative
style.
For
example,
in
twelfth
grade
I
was
responsible
for
writing
my
first
major
term
paper.
I
Decided
to
write
about
one
of
Mark
Twain's
less
known
novels
which
satirized
the
political
system.
I
remember
being
excited
about
the
topic
because
I
loved
politics
but
I
feared
writing
a
paper
of
this
magnitude.
I
had
spent
the
year
learning
the
proper
way
to
write
a
paragraph
and
how
to
introduce
and
end
a
paper.
It
all
seemed
so
rigid
and
I
never
really
grasped
the
set
paper
structure
that
they
were
teaching.
In
particular,
I
remember
being
told
that
all
college
professors
did
not
want
writers
to
refer
to
themselves
in
the
first
person.
I
thought
that
this
was
a
ridiculous
rule
and
made
the
paper
sound
rigid.
On
the
other
hand,
the
papers
I
was
required
to
right
in
high
school
did
not
lend
themselves
to
adding
many
personal
statements.
I
formed
a
thesis
which
was
taken
primarily
taken
from
a
book
I
had
found
in
the
library.
Following
the
formation
of
my
thesis,
I
found
proof
for
my
thesis
in
literary
books
written
on
the
subject.
In
hindsight,
I
never
really
put
forth
an
argument.
I
just
reported
what
others
thought
about
my
thesis.
Everything
was
sighted
properly
but
how
much
I
actually
learned
from
writing
papers
this
way
paper
is
questionable
because
I
never
really
thought
about
the
information.
During
this
time
in
my
writing
experience
editing
was
virtually
none
existent.
I
did
skim
the
paper
for
spelling
errors
and
grammatical
errors
but
the
organization
and
ideas
of
the
paper
where
never
reconsidered.
I
felt,
at
the
time,
that
the
way
my
ideas
came
out
the
first
time
where
as
good
as
they
were
going
to
get.
Rewriting
was
not
a
word
in
my
vocabulary
and
as
a
result
my
papers
were
very
hollow.
I
am
sure
that
the
ideas
were
incomplete
which
is
probably
the
reason
that
I
felt
that
these
papers
were
solely
factual
as
opposed
to
argumentative.
Leaving
high
school,
I
was
very
insecure
in
my
writing
ability.
It
was
definitely
the
skill
I
was
least
confident
in.
I
absolutely
hated
writing.
It
felt
oppressive
because
I
viewed
the
writing
process
as
merely
following
a
bunch
of
rules
to
report
what
others
thought
about
a
topic.
I
much
preferred
speaking
because
it
seemed
much
freer
than
writing
and
I
thought
it
was
the
best
medium
for
expressing
my
thoughts.
This
can
be
attributed
to
the
fact
that,
up
to
this
time
I
never
used
writing
as
a
medium
for
arguing
for
my
opinions.
When
I
entered
Lafayette
in
the
fall
of
1995
I
was
nervous
about
my
writing.
I
knew
that
organizing
papers
was
my
big
problem.
I
recall
the
problems
and
feelings
I
had
when
my
first
college
paper
was
assigned
in
my
first
year
seminar.
It
was
a
short
three
to
five
page
paper
on
racism.
The
professor
specifically
instructed
us
to
concentrate
on
forming
an
argument
in
the
paper
and
to
avoid
reporting
what
others
thought.
This
was
very
new
to
me
but
I
was
very
excited
because
I
had
a
lot
of
ideas
and
opinions
on
the
subject
that
I
had
been
expressing
in
class.
When
it
came
time
to
write
the
paper
I
had
no
idea
how
I
was
going
to
present
them
in
a
written
form.
Consequently,
I
could
not
narrow
the
my
ideas
so
the
first
draft
came
out
as
a
bunch
of
ramblings.
I
followed
the
rules
that
I
learned
in
high
school
exactly
as
I
had
memorized
them
but
they
didn't
seem
to
help.
My
introduction
was
an
attempt
to
use
the
funnel
method.
I
started
broad
and
then
tried
to
narrow
the
topic
to
the
thesis
sentence.
I
never
used
the
words
I
or
me
and
I
concluded
with
a
closing
paragraph
that
attempted
to
wrap
everything
up.
In
between
the
introduction
and
conclusion,
there
was
a
mess
of
ramblings
that
left
me
ashamed
to
even
hand
in
the
paper.
The
only
thing
I
was
pleased
with
in
the
paper
was
some
of
the
individual
ideas
that
I
had
presented
in
the
paper.
I
knew
they
didn't
flow
or
proceed
logically
to
create
a
strong
paper
though.
When
I
handed
in
the
first
draft
I
dreaded
the
fact
that
I
would
have
to
work
on
this
paper
more.
The
ironic
thing
is,
I
never
knew
how
much
I
would
have
to
work
on
this
paper
because
I
had
never
before
attempted
a
serious
rewrite
of
a
paper.
I
first
met
with
my
writing
associate
and
professed
to
her
my
feeling
of
disorganization
when
I
wrote.
She
and
I
discussed
what
it
really
meant
to
rewrite
a
paper.
I
left
the
meeting
knowing
that
the
task
before
me
was
great
because
my
first
draft
of
the
paper
paralleled
my
work
in
high
school.
It
was
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
facts
but
I
failed
to
clearly
show
how
I
felt
these
facts
supported
my
argument.
In
fact,
the
professor
and
the
Writing
Associate
scribbled
why
or
needs
development
over
a
half
dozen
times
on
the
paper.
In
my
first
attempt
at
a
serious
rewrite
I
tried
to
answer
all
of
the
questions
my
WA
and
professor
had
posed
when
reading
my
paper.
The
result
was
a
substantial
addition
of
argumentation
which
greatly
increased
the
clarity
and
effectiveness
of
my
paper.
For
the
first
time
since
elementary
school,
I
enjoyed
writing
again
because
I
was
able
to
present
an
intelligent
argument.
I
was
still
not
confident
in
my
writing
but
I
learned
something
valuable
from
this
first
college
paper.
I
learned
that
a
good
paper
requires
sound
and
thorough
arguments
which
came
best
be
accomplished,
for
me,
through
rewriting.
I
was
also
beginning
to
view
writing
as
a
process
for
the
first
time.
As
the
semester
continued
I
remember
struggling
with
the
same
issues
of
organization
and
clarity.
Every
time
I
wrote
a
paper
I
did
spend
more
time
and
effort
on
the
process
of
rewriting
the
paper
but
in
retrospect
it
was
still
pretty
minimal.
My
confidence
was
also
rising
in
large
part
because
I
was
willing
to
work
on
my
papers
with
writing
associates
and
professors
who
helped
me
point
out
weaknesses
in
my
arguments.
This
assistance
was
crucial
in
my
development
as
a
writer
because,
at
the
time,
I
was
unable
to
see
the
weaknesses
in
my
papers
by
myself.
I
needed
an
objective
view
point.
Most
of
my
first
semester
sophomore
classes
emphasized
writing.
I
felt
ready
for
the
challenge
because
I
thought
I
knew
the
proper
format
for
writing
a
good
paper.
After
all,
I
had
used
the
same
format
with
success
throughout
my
freshman
year.
The
writing
requirements
in
one
of
my
introductory
government
classes
taught
me
otherwise.
The
professor
had
a
specific
format
that
he
was
looking
for
in
papers
which
was
very
different
from
what
I
had
used
in
my
papers
the
previous
year.
The
opening
paragraph
was
the
most
different
and
difficult
to
master.
The
professor
required
that
the
paper
start
with
a
topical
question
that
was
to
be
discussed
in
a
thorough
manner
in
the
opening
paragraph
ending
with
the
paper's
thesis
which
was
to
support
one
side
of
the
topical
question.
In
the
first
paper,
I
struggled
with
the
format
and
the
result
was
that
the
paper
again
seemed
unorganized.
I
learned
form
this
experience
that
although
the
style
was
different
the
concept
of
writing
a
paper
was
the
same.
This
further
indicates
to
me
that
writing
is
not
an
exact
art:
rather,
it
is
a
process
by
which
the
author
must
struggle
with
concepts
in
the
paper
and
the
professor's
requirements
for
the
paper.
After
accepting
the
fact
that
writing
was
going
to
be
a
constant
struggle
between
ideas,
style,
reader
requirements
I
began
to
see
weaknesses
in
my
papers
by
myself.
For
the
first
time
I
developed
I
a
method
for
rewriting
that
seemed
to
work
for
me.
I
started
with
an
outline
of
my
ideas
and
how
I
was
going
to
support
them.
I
then
wrote
a
first
draft
in
which
I
tried
to
get
my
ideas
out
and
the
beginning
of
a
paper
written.
When
the
first
draft
was
completed,
I
would
let
the
paper
sit
for
a
day
or
two
before
I
started
to
edit
it.
I
first
checked
to
make
sure
that
the
ideas
and
sentences
made
sense.
Then
I
would
go
back
and
mark
areas
where
I
felt
the
arguments
were
not
clear
or
complete-
I
would
write
why
and
needs
more
all
over
the
paper.
After
I
added
to
the
areas
that
I
felt
were
weak
I
would
go
back
and
reread
the
paper
to
see
if
rearranging
the
order
of
the
paper
would
strengthen
it.
As
the
papers
have
gotten
more
complex
I
have
found
that
this
is
almost
always
the
case.
I
then
like
to
talk
about
the
paper
with
friends
or
the
professor
because
an
objective
reader
can
always
add
something
that
the
author
cannot
see.
I
always
end
with
rewriting
the
opening
paragraph
once
the
ideas
of
the
paper
have
been
fully
developed
to
add
strength
to
the
paper.
This
process
has
become
a
very
long
process
for
me
but
the
results
are
evident
in
my
writing.
My
rough
drafts
are
generally
filled
with
holes
and
very
disorganized
but
the
repetitive
nature
of
my
rewriting
process
slowly
filters
out
the
holes.
As
I
thought
about
the
way
my
writing
has
evolved
over
my
fourteen
years
of
school
I
realized
one
thing.
The
process
of
writing
is
one
of
the
ways
I
learn
best
because
it
is
evolutionary.
It
forces
me
to
struggle
to
understand
the
subject
I
am
writing
about.
Each
time
I
rewrite
a
paper
I
learn
more
about
the
subject
because
I
must
dig
deeper
to
improve
the
paper.
This
proves
to
me
that
knowledge
is
not
something
that
is
objective
and
thus
cannot
be
found
in
a
text
or
a
lecture:
rather,
knowledge
can
only
be
gained
through
the
process
of
learning.
Therefore,
writing
is
an
ongoing
struggle
with
a
process
which
can
always
be
improved.
For
me,
this
means
that
my
writing
will
always
be
a
work
in
progress.
