Literacy
Narrative
1998
Yeah,
I'm
Still
Writing
A
second
year
of
writing
on
the
college
level
has
left
me
so
immersed
in
the
flow
and
style
of
academic
writing
that
I
almost
feel
uncomfortable
writing
in
the
first
person.
In
technical
writing
for
psychology,
I
have
learned
to
distance
myself
from
the
text
of
lab
reports.
Rather
than
I
discovered,
or
We
found,
it
is
proper
to
write,
The
experiment
demonstrated,
or
The
results
showed.
Likewise,
I
have
assumed
the
voices
of
both
an
historian
and
a
literary
critic,
neither
of
whom
conventionally
writes
in
the
first
person.
In
David
Bartholomae's
words,
in
writing
for
an
audience
that
knows
more
about
the
given
subject
matter,
I
have
assumed
the
privilege
of
being
an
insider.
So,
discussing
my
experiences
as
a
writer
in
the
past
year
will
be
an
interesting
exercise
in
itself.
The
only
insiders
are
accomplished
writers.
As
for
the
subject
matter,
no
one
knows
more
about
my
experiences
in
the
last
year
than
me.
I
suppose
that
that
makes
this
sort
of
exercise
the
ultimate
in
reader-based
prose.
This
was
my
first
year
as
a
writing
associate.
I
soon
learned
that
the
effect
of
that
title
would
extend
far
beyond
the
specified
WA
duties
and
responsibilities.
First
of
all,
simply
reading
other
students'
papers
and
discussing
common
problems
in
our
weekly
staff
meetings
has
helped
me
to
identify
potential
weaknesses
in
my
own
writing.
It
feels
pretty
silly
to
show
someone
else
a
grammatical
error
and
then
catch
myself
doing
the
same
thing
a
few
hours
later.
The
unfortunate
result
of
my
increased
error
consciousness
has
been
another
thing
I
tell
other
people
not
to
do.
I've
found
myself
constantly
editing
as
I
write,
instead
of
getting
all
of
my
thoughts
down
at
once.
I'm
even
doing
it
right
now;
this
is
the
third
sentence
I've
written
here
before
moving
on!
Second,
being
a
writing
associate
has
caused
me
to
raise
my
personal
standards.
When
in
the
past
I
might
have
been
willing
to
finesse
an
assignment
that
I
perceived
to
be
unimportant
to
my
grade
(if
not
completely
irrelevant
to
anything
on
the
entire
planet),
I
feel
compelled
to
bare
down
and
gave
it
a
legitimate
effort.
After
all,
now
every
piece
of
writing
I
produce
for
one
of
my
classes
in
a
small
way
represents
the
whole
college
writing
program.
If
a
professor
doesn't
respect
my
writing,
he
or
she
may
adopt
a
negative
attitude
about
the
program
in
general.
Finally,
being
a
writing
associate
has
tested
my
communication
skills.
No,
I
don't
mean
my
ability
to
convey
ideas
to
the
student
writers.
However,
I
suppose
that
is
worth
mentioning.
I
feel
as
though
my
technique
was
fairly
decent
to
begin
with,
but
there
is
always
room
for
improvement.
No
WA
wants
to
spend
the
entire
conference
lecturing.
Yet,
it
is
certainly
necessary
to
get
things
moving
in
the
right
direction.
In
fact,
there
is
a
need
to
constantly
try
new
approaches
and
gambits.
My
goals
are
to
speak
less,
be
more
concise,
and
evoke
more
meaningful
verbal
responses
from
the
writers.
Prior
to
that
brief
revelation,
I
had
intended
to
refer
instead
to
a
balance
of
power,
finesse,
deference,
and
tact:
my
relationship
with
the
professors
whose
classes
I
have
worked
with.
I've
found
that
not
all
professors
come
into
this
relationship
with
the
same
expectations.
Also,
some
have
utterly
inappropriate
expectations
for
the
students,
as
was
the
case
in
both
the
classes
I
dealt
with
last
year.
In
the
fall
semester,
my
first
as
a
WA,
the
syllabus
that
I
received
gave
me
the
impression
of
a
normal
first-year
seminar.
However,
by
the
time
I
had
finished
my
first
round
of
conferences,
it
had
become
apparent
that
this
course
would
not
resemble
my
FYS
at
all.
The
students
were
extremely
frustrated,
to
say
the
least.
Rather
than
the
relaxed,
conversational
atmosphere
that
prevails
in
most
FYS
classrooms,
this
course
clearly
had
the
feel
of
a
lecture.
The
course
met
once
a
week
for
three
hours,
an
incredibly
long
time
to
merely
sit,
listen,
and
take
notes.
The
students
were
expected
to
have
an
unreasonable
mastery
of
the
subject
matter,
considering
that
not
only
were
they
in
their
first
semester
of
college,
but
most
had
not
selected
the
course
and
were
not
interested
in
pursuing
it.
The
professor
was
available
on
campus
only
on
the
day
that
the
class
met.
Finally,
aside
from
requiring
that
everyone
meet
with
me,
he
seemed
uninterested
in
my
role
in
the
process.
He
did
not
return
my
e-mail
or
phone
messages,
and
I
finally
was
able
to
meet
with
him
only
when
I
showed
up
at
the
class
and
introduced
myself.
Needless
to
say,
these
many
factors
made
it
difficult
for
me
to
build
a
relationship
with
the
professor.
For
both
myself
and
the
students
in
the
class,
it
was
impossible
to
communicate
the
concerns
that
many
of
them
voiced
to
me.
My
response
was
to
go
about
my
business
as
I
saw
fit.
I
kept
my
focus
on
the
students'
writing,
and
did
the
best
I
could
to
help
them
meet
his
lofty
standards.
So,
in
the
second
semester,
I
was
determined
to
get
off
on
the
right
foot.
Things
started
looking
up
from
the
beginning,
as
this
professor
was
eager
to
meet
with
me.
We
talked
about
the
assignment
that
the
students
in
the
VAST
would
be
required
to
complete,
a
60-page
paper,
written
in
teams
of
three.
It
seemed
difficult,
but
for
the
time
being,
I
was
optimistic.
After
all,
he
wanted
to
set
up
a
special
class
pizza
party
so
that
I
could
meet
the
students
in
person.
When
the
offer
of
a
free
lunch
is
put
on
the
table,
I'm
all
ears.
It
wasn't
until
later
that
I
fully
digested
what
he
had
told
me.
A
60-page
paper?
Teams
of
three?
I
started
to
read
the
fine
print.
Suddenly,
this
didn't
sound
too
good.
The
syllabus
required
the
students
to
meet
with
me
twice.
At
the
first
meeting,
they
were
supposed
to
be
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
done.
Of
course,
that
meant
I
would
need
to
read
about
40
pages
from
each
of
the
five
groups.
The
second
time,
I'd
be
confronted
with
the
full
60!
As
it
turned
out,
the
professor
had
not
been
quite
as
candid
when
explaining
the
assignment
to
the
class
as
he
had
been
with
me.
When
the
teams
met
with
me
for
the
first
time,
most
of
them
had
produced
decent
papers,
and
felt
that
they
had
fulfilled
the
questions
posed
by
the
assignment.
However,
the
papers
weren't
really
structured
the
way
he
had
described
to
me.
He
wanted
a
paper
that
flowed
as
if
it
came
from
one
pen.
But,
in
order
to
tackle
the
daunting
task
of
a
60-page
paper,
the
respective
teams
had
all
basically
divided
their
texts
into
three
parts,
one
for
each
person.
This
led
to
choppy
papers,
with
obvious
changes
in
writing
style.
Also,
in
a
few
groups,
there
was
an
overlap
of
information
between
the
sections.
In
addition,
as
a
whole,
they
were
heavy
on
facts
and
light
on
analysis.
My
first
goal
was
to
stimulate
communication
between
the
members
of
the
group.
Some
of
them
hadn't
even
read
each
other's
work.
As
I
said,
most
of
the
papers
presented
a
lot
of
information
without
really
providing
any
commentary.
I
tried
to
get
each
group
to
generate
a
collaborative,
broad
thesis
that
could
be
applied
to
each
portion
of
the
paper.
Once
they
had
decided
on
what
the
paper
was
going
to
say,
it
was
easier
for
me
to
coordinate
mixing
and
matching
sections,
locate
the
need
for
transition
paragraphs,
and
suggest
potential
flaws
or
holes
in
their
arguments.
In
the
end,
I
think
even
the
professor
decided
that
this
sort
of
project
was
unreasonable.
The
students
and
I
shared
our
sympathy
for
one
another
throughout
the
semester.
I
was
sorry
that
they
had
to
write
them,
and
they
were
sorry
I
had
to
read
them.
However,
everyone
was
very
appreciative
of
my
efforts.
If
I
ever
face
such
an
assignment,
I'll
have
a
better
idea
of
how
to
tackle
it
than
they
did.
In
working
with
that
class,
I
also
observed
the
different
ways
people
can
interpret
(or
misinterpret)
something
that
is
written
ambiguously.
Aside
from
my
life
as
a
WA,
of
course,
was
my
own
writing.
As
I
mentioned
earlier,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
write
in
many
different
styles.
Above
all,
I've
improved
my
scientific
writing
for
psychology.
The
technical
writing
found
in
psychology
journals
is
completely
different
from
anything
that
I
ever
wrote
in
high
school.
But,
the
more
lab
reports
I
write,
the
more
familiar
it
becomes.
I
have
learned
to
be
particularly
clear
and
concise.
In
situations
when
I
might
have
previously
reached
for
a
thesaurus,
I
settle
for
a
common
word
or
reuse
the
same
one
from
the
last
sentence.
That
practice,
especially,
has
required
a
lot
of,
well,
practice.
Last
semester,
I
started
doing
behavioral
research
with
Dr.
Allan
of
the
psychology
department.
So,
he's
given
me
a
collection
of
journal
articles
to
read
that
pertain
to
his
research.
I
am
certain
that
having
recently
been
on
the
side
of
a
naive
reader
trying
to
understand
other
people's
work
has
helped
me
further
appreciate
the
need
for
clarity
and
brevity.
So,
we
can
put
another
year
of
my
career
as
a
writer
in
the
books,
and
I'd
say
I'm
still
pretty
good
at
it.
But,
rather
than
utilizing
that
skill
as
a
way
to
breeze
through
assignments
at
the
last
minute,
I'm
now
creating
higher
quality
work.
I
have
enough
pride
in
my
writing
that
I
spend
the
time
sufficient
to
do
it
correctly.
Personally,
I'm
not
convinced
that
this
little
history
is
one
of
the
all-time
greatest
things
that
I've
ever
written.
In
fact,
I
don't
like
it
very
much.
Have
I
lost
my
touch?
Maybe
it's
just
some
summer
rust.
Or
maybe
I
need
the
comfort
of
a
cramped
dorm
room
in
order
to
write.
Or
maybe
I'm
just
an
overly
critical
WA.
