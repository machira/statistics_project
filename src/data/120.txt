Reflections
of
a
Writer
WA
Paper
8/15/97
As
soon
as
I
learned
that
you
could
string
a
group
of
words
together
to
express
a
thought,
I
fell
in
love
with
writing.
It
was
not
merely
the
expression
of
thought
that
interested
me
in
writing
though,
it
was
more.
It
was
the
way
that
the
keyboard
clicked
when
the
words
ran
out
of
my
head
and
through
my
fingers;
the
way
that
long
words
looked
all
curly
when
written
out
in
cursive;
the
way
that
certain
words
strung
together
in
just
the
right
order
could
sound
rhythmic
and
melodic;
the
way
that
writing
my
feelings
down
on
paper
could
lift
nearly
any
thundercloud.
These
were
the
aspects
of
writing
that
I
fell
in
love
with,
and
over
the
years,
I
have
used
this
romance
with
writing
to
my
benefit
both
personally
and
academically.
Although
I
can't
remember
the
exact
age
I
was
when
I
started
writing,
I
remember
that
my
earliest
experiences
were
merely
an
extension
of
"playing
pretend."
Simply
by
picking
up
one
of
those
black
and
white
hard
covered
composition
books
and
a
pencil,
I
could
create
any
scenario
my
little
heart
desired.
If
I
wanted
a
larger
family
with
lots
of
brothers
and
sisters,
I
could
make
one.
If
I
wanted
to
travel
to
a
foreign
country,
I
could
just
catch
a
jet
and
see
all
of
the
sites
without
booking
a
single
reservation.
After
about
six
or
seven
pages
of
living
in
Australia
with
eight
brothers
and
sisters,
I
would
become
bored
with
this
imaginary
life,
so,
I
would
put
down
my
pencil
and
go
show
Mom
my
precious
story.
She
would
always
humor
me
by
reading
my
childish
writing
and
fanciful
stories
and
tell
me
what
a
good
writer
I
was.
With
Mom's
praises
under
my
belt,
I
would
run
to
my
room
and
tuck
my
half
finished
story
away
to
be
published
when
I
got
older.
Unfortunately,
at
this
young
age,
I
was
not
nearly
as
excited
with
my
academic
writing
assignments
as
I
was
with
my
recreational
writing.
To
say
the
least,
in
my
earlier
school
years,
the
writing
assignments
bored
me.
It
seemed
like
I
did
written
reports
on
all
fifty
states.
However,
it
was
during
this
period
of
unenjoyable
writing,
that
my
third
grade
teacher,
Mrs.
Wolfe,
gave
me
two
valuable
tips,
which
I
still
use
even
today:
1.
Don't
begin
your
sentences
with
the
same
word
every
time.
2.
Don't
use
the
word
"and"
in
every
sentence.
Finally,
in
fourth
grade,
I
learned
that
the
writing
I
did
in
school
could
be
just
as
much
fun
as
the
writing
I
did
outside
of
school.
My
teacher,
Mr.
Davenport
introduced
this
concept
by
telling
the
class
a
story,
and
then,
right
as
he
reached
the
climax,
he
would
tell
us
to
take
out
our
composition
books
and
finish
the
story
ourselves.
I
feasted
on
these
types
of
assignments.
Fortunately
for
me,
during
this
time
I
was
accepted
into
an
extra
class
called
Enrichment,
where
keeping
a
notebook
and
filling
it
with
creative
writing
was
a
requirement.
Not
only
did
this
class
allow
me
to
use
my
love
for
writing
to
produce
something
academically
acceptable,
it
also
introduced
me
to
computers.
Right
from
the
start
I
had
a
fascination
with
computers;
not
with
their
incredible
technology
or
time
saving
programs,
but
with
the
noises
that
they
made.
I
loved
the
click-clack
of
the
keys
as
they
caressed
the
alphabet
on
the
tips
of
my
fingers.
In
addition
to
the
attractive
musical
quality
that
the
computer
offered,
it
also
made
writing
my
stories
twice
the
fun.
However,
we
didn't
own
a
computer
at
home,
so,
from
under
at
least
five
year's
of
dust,
I
insisted
that
my
mom
exhume
her
old
typewriter.
At
ten
year's
old
I
preferred
the
typewriter
over
the
television.
The
next
couple
of
years
harbored
a
lull
in
my
recreational
writing
activity.
My
stories
took
a
back
seat
to
more
exciting
things
like
friends,
gossip,
and
boys.
Free
time
that
had
once
been
used
on
the
typewriter,
was
now
spent
on
the
phone.
Occasionally,
I
would
write
in
my
diary,
which
was
one
of
those
cheesy,
plastic
covered
books
that
locks,
but
not
very
often.
On
the
contrary,
my
reading
activity
during
these
years
went
into
overdrive,
and
as
a
result,
my
general
knowledge
and
vocabulary
grew
tremendously.
By
the
time
I
was
in
eighth
grade,
an
immense
transformation
could
be
seen
in
my
writing
ability,
yet
I
still
was
only
writing
occasionally.
However,
my
attitude
towards
writing
was
dramatically
changed
by
one
assignment
in
my
English
class.
Prior
to
this
assignment,
I
had
always
dreaded
going
to
English.
For
four
years
I
had
studied
prepositions,
comas,
verbs,
and
dissected
thousands
of
sentences
for
subordinate
clauses;
it
bored
me
every
year.
Finally,
at
the
end
of
my
eighth
grade
year,
my
teacher,
Mrs.
Ulatowsky,
decided
we
had
learned
enough
grammar
and
introduced
us
to
several
different
types
of
poetry.
She
then
asked
us
to
make
a
book
including
one
poem
from
each
of
the
various
types
of
poetry
that
she
had
shown
us
(ie.
Haiku,
sonnet,
etc.).
I
had
always
liked
to
read
poetry,
but
had
never
even
thought
about
writing
it.
Needless
to
say,
I
loved
the
assignment
and
it
was
one
of
the
main
reasons
that
I
began
to
write
again
in
my
free
time.
Generally,
I
liked
writing
poetry
even
more
than
writing
fiction.
Poetry
was
more
concise.
An
emotion
that
took
a
paragraph
of
writing
to
convey
to
the
reader
in
a
fictional
story
could
be
expressed
in
one
line
of
a
poem.
Poems
were
like
puzzles,
the
subject
and
emotion
of
your
thoughts
could
be
disguised
behind
something
as
insignificant
as
the
sunrise,
but
when
read
in
the
right
context
could
become
as
transparent
as
a
piece
of
glass.
My
first
poems
were
all
about
love,
its
ups
and
downs.
When
I
go
back
and
read
them
now
they
make
me
laugh,
but
they
are
a
true
representation
of
what
I
believed
at
that
time
in
my
life.
In
high
school,
writing
took
on
a
whole
new
light.
English
was
no
longer
the
class
that
I
dreaded
going
to.
Although
ninth
grade
English
included
a
long
review
in
grammar,
it
also
contained
a
terrific
literature
section.
There
weren't
many
writing
assignments
that
year,
but
I
learned
about
a
lot
of
great
tools
for
writing,
such
as
onomatopoeia
and
consonance.
In
tenth
grade,
we
continued
to
study
literature,
but
Mr.
Bailey
also
assigned
plenty
of
writing
projects
along
with
the
required
readings.
Unlike
the
other
students,
who
would
groan
and
complain
about
the
writing
projects,
I
enjoyed
them.
Of
course,
there
was
always
that
dull,
dry
assignment
that
I
shuddered
at
even
starting,
but
for
the
most
part
I
looked
forward
to
writing
for
class.
Perhaps
I
wouldn't
have
enjoyed
writing
these
papers
as
much
if
I
hadn't
gotten
the
good
feedback
on
them
that
I
received
from
Mr.
Bailey.
He
would
always
pick
one
or
two
of
his
favorite
papers
to
read
for
the
class,
and
often,
he
would
pick
mine.
Mostly,
I
liked
his
class
because
there
were
plenty
of
opportunities
for
me
to
write
poetry.
Once,
Mr.
Bailey
even
allowed
us
to
go
outside
for
class
so
that
nature
could
inspire
us
to
write
a
poem
for
a
project.
In
tenth
grade,
writing
was
just
academic
work
that
I
actually
liked
to
do
,
but
junior
year
it
became
so
much
more
than
just
measly
assignments
that
I
didn't
mind
doing.
Composition
was
a
requirement
for
all
juniors
in
my
high
school.
When
I
was
younger,
I
used
to
think
that
it
was
kind
of
funny
that
you
could
actually
take
a
class
and
write
stories
and
consider
it
hard
work.
For
the
most
part,
that
little
girl
mind
set
was
not
far
from
the
mark.
For
me,
composition
was
more
pleasurable
than
difficult.
Mrs.
Beardslee
was
an
excellent
teacher.
She
required
that
we
keep
an
in-class
journal
and
everyday
for
the
first
twenty
minutes
of
class
she
would
give
us
a
subject
about
which
to
write.
For
instance,
one
day
she
had
a
picture
of
the
Mona
Lisa
taped
to
the
blackboard
and
she
asked
us
to
write
about
what
Mona
Lisa
was
thinking
about
when
daVinci
painted
her
portrait.
These
daily
exercises
served
as
a
pre-game
warm
up
to
the
larger
assignments
she
would
give
later
in
the
class.
We
had
four
main
papers
to
write
for
the
semester:
an
exposition,
a
persuasive
paper,
a
character
sketch,
and
a
narrative.
Honestly,
my
writing
did
not
show
any
drastic
improvement
throughout
the
semester.
I
went
in
writing
above
the
expected
level,
and
I
came
out
still
writing
above
that
expected
level.
However,
I
did
obtain
some
valuable
information
in
the
class.
Mrs.
Beardslee
equipped
us
with
several
cheat
sheets
of
transition
words
and
a
list
of
various
ways
to
begin
a
paper,
which
I
still
pull
out
to
help
me
with
assignments
today.
Tragically,
my
writing
really
evolved
when
two
of
my
friends
were
killed
in
a
terrible
car
accident.
Never
being
one
to
share
my
sadness
with
others,
I
turned
to
writing
to
help
me
to
express
my
grief.
I
have
at
least
a
dozen
poems
that
were
written
within
the
month
of
Adam
and
Tara's
death.
With
each
poem
that
I
wrote,
my
understanding
of
the
finality
of
death
and
the
continuation
of
life
grew
deeper.
However,
unlike
the
self-glorifying
reasons
with
which
I
wrote
for
academically,
these
poems
served
as
a
sort
of
therapy.
I
would
have
been
mortified
had
someone
picked
up
one
of
my
poems,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
reader
sang
songs
of
praises
afterward.
From
this
time
on,
I
wrote
not
to
please
or
entertain
other
people,
but
to
satisfy
myself.
With
this
new
passion
for
writing,
I
entered
into
my
senior
year;
a
year
of
college
applications
and
term
papers,
a
year
of
AP
courses
and
graduation
speeches.
My
largest
writing
assignments
that
year
were
three
term
papers:
one
each
for
Biology,
English,
and
American
History.
I
enjoyed
researching
all
of
my
topics,
especially
for
English
because
I
examined
the
works
of
a
poet
I
admire:
A.E.
Housman.
Nevertheless,
research
papers
have
never
been
my
favorite
to
write,
so
it
was
the
smaller
assignments
that
illustrated
my
best
work.
For
example,
for
homework
in
English
we
were
to
write
a
short
poem
illustrating
consonance.
I
got
so
involved
in
the
assignment
that
my
short
poem
turned
into
a
three
page
version
of
the
fairytale
Snow
White
and
the
Seven
Dwarfs.
At
the
end
of
the
year
I
had
to
write
a
speech
for
graduation.
I
really
believe
that
this
speech
was
the
hardest
thing
that
I've
ever
had
to
write.
Not
only
did
I
have
to
stand
up
and
speak
in
front
of
all
the
parents,
brothers,
sisters,
aunts,
and
uncles,
but
I
also
had
to
come
up
with
something
brilliant
to
say.
I
wanted
to
capture
every
moment,
every
thought,
every
fear,
of
the
students
that
I
had
gone
to
school
with
for
four
years.
I
wanted
to
sound
sincere
and
sentimental,
but
not
overly
sappy.
There
were
probably
ten
different
versions
of
my
speech
written
before
I
finally
decided
on
one
that
began
with
a
quote
from
Aldous
Huxley:
"Experience
is
not
what
happens
to
a
man.
It
is
what
a
man
does
with
what
happens
to
him."
I
used
this
quote
as
a
thesis
for
my
speech.
I
then
went
on
to
contemplate
all
that
had
happened
to
us
since
freshman
year
and
all
that
we
still
had
to
experience
in
college
and
the
workforce.
However,
even
as
I
gave
this
speech,
college
still
seemed
light
years
away.
Before
I
knew
it
though,
I
had
entered
the
collegiate
world.
At
first,
I
felt
like
a
toddler
that
had
been
forced
to
drive
a
car.
I
had
never
written
a
protocol;
I
didn't
know
the
first
thing
about
abstracts;
and
how
was
I
supposed
to
use
the
computers
in
the
library
to
find
all
of
the
books
I
needed
for
my
research
paper?
Luckily,
only
two
of
my
first
semester
classes
required
a
large
amount
of
writing.
My
First
Year
Seminar
required
three
papers
and,
fortunately
for
me,
I
was
interested
in
the
subject
of
all
three
papers.
The
professor
of
my
FYS
seemed
to
like
my
writing
style,
and
the
papers
were
really
no
harder
to
write
than
any
that
I
had
written
in
high
school.
My
chemistry
lab
however,
was
another
story.
I
had
never
written
a
report
for
a
lab
before,
and
the
technically
precise
way
that
the
reports
needed
to
be
written
was
hard
to
master.
Before
long
though,
I
was
hammering
out
at
least
one
lab
report
a
week,
and
each
time
it
got
a
little
easier.
Likewise,
I
didn't
experience
any
huge
transition
from
high
school
writing
to
college
writing
during
the
second
semester.
Lab
reports
still
gave
me
a
mild
headache,
but
my
First
Year
Writing
was
very
much
like
my
First
Year
Seminar,
in
that
the
professor
liked
my
style
of
writing,
so
no
major
modifications
in
my
writing
were
necessary.
Aside
from
academics,
I
write
only
when
the
mood
strikes
me,
which
happens
to
be
mostly
when
I'm
feeling
down.
I
keep
a
blank
book
to
fill
with
my
poetry,
and
recently,
I
began
to
keep
a
journal.
My
journal
is
like
a
close
friend.
It
isn't
something
that
I
have
to
keep
up
with
everyday,
but
it
is
always
right
where
I've
left
it
when
I
feel
the
urge
to
unload.
In
many
ways,
my
writing
has
changed
dramatically
from
my
childish
pretend
stories,
but
in
some
ways
it
has
not
changed
at
all.
I
still
love
the
way
that
writing
can
make
me
feel
creative
and
artistic;
I
still
love
the
sound
of
the
keys
clicking
on
the
computer.
Mostly
though,
I
love
the
way
that
writing
can
transport
me
from
one
state
of
mind
to
another
in
just
a
matter
of
minutes.
