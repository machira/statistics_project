My
Literary
Narrative
Project
for
WA
Workshop
August
17,
2001
My
earliest
recollections
of
writing
are
not
of
school
assignments
or
entries
in
my
journal.
Rather,
I
remember
my
mother
handing
me
a
stack
of
'thank
you'
cards
and
saying,
"Now
write
to
Grandma
and
Grandpa
that
you
appreciate
their
gift,
and
explain
why
you
like
it
and
how
you
will
use
it."
Like
most
children,
I
would
pick
up
my
pencil
and
write
in
large
lettering
(so
that
I
could
write
only
a
few
sentences
and
still
fill
up
the
entire
note
card).
"Dear
Grandma
and
Grandpa:
Thank
you
for
the
twenty
dollars.
I
like
it
because
now
I
can
buy
a
new
Barbie
doll
with
my
own
money
and
I
won't
have
to
share
with
Erin
(my
younger
sister)."
After
signing
my
name,
I
handed
the
card
to
my
mother
for
her
approval.
Most
of
the
time,
she
would
commend
me
on
my
work,
but
occasionally
I
had
to
add
a
few
extra
sentences
because
I
sometimes
failed
to
say
'why'
I
liked
the
gift
or
'how'
I
would
use
it
in
an
effort
to
finish
the
task
as
quickly
as
possible.
From
thank
you
notes
I
moved
on
to
club
constitutions.
Starting
out
with
an
idea
like
"The
Club:
No
Erin's
Allowed,"
I
gathered
up
a
few
of
my
friends
to
join
me
in
writing
our
names
on
the
official
club
roster
and
drafting
a
club
constitution
that
usually
consisted
of
a
list
of
things
members
of
the
"Shannon
Club"
may
do
and
that
Erin
may
not
do.
Following
the
club
meeting,
I
wrote
a
journal
entry
in
the
notebook
in
which
I
explained
why
my
sister
annoyed
me.
Everything
we
wrote
was
top
secret,
written
in
a
marble
notebook
that
I
hid
in
my
closet
so
my
parents
would
not
find
it.
Whenever
Erin
made
me
angry,
I
would
pull
the
book
out
of
my
closet
and
vent
my
frustration
in
another
journal
entry
or
amendment
to
the
club
constitution.
In
school,
the
first
memory
I
have
of
writing
was
in
first
grade.
My
family
went
on
vacation
to
Hawaii
and
San
Francisco,
California
for
two
weeks
that
year,
and
my
teacher
asked
me
to
keep
a
journal
about
the
trip.
This
was
the
beginning
of
numerous
assigned
journals.
From
first
grade
on,
every
time
I
read
a
book
or
took
a
field
trip,
I
had
to
write
journal
entries
describing
my
reactions
to
the
experience.
I
have
never
enjoyed
this
type
of
writing.
Stopping
at
the
end
of
each
chapter
in
a
book
or
each
day
on
a
trip
to
write
about
my
observations
was
always
an
annoyance
to
me.
I
would
much
rather
write
an
essay
summarizing
my
feelings
about
the
experience
or
piece
of
literature
after
its
conclusion.
In
second
grade,
I
wrote
my
first
research
paper.
Each
student
in
my
class
chose
a
President
to
write
about
--
mine
was
Theodore
Roosevelt.
I
soon
found
I
liked
this
type
of
writing
much
more
than
journal
entries
and
creative
writing.
After
researching
basic
facts
at
the
library,
my
parents
took
me
to
Sagamore
Hill,
Roosevelt's
home
on
Long
Island
(where
I
live)
where
I
could
see
for
myself
many
of
the
things
that
were
mentioned
in
the
books.
Though
many
similar
research
papers
would
follow,
the
piece
of
writing
I
remember
most
in
elementary
school
was
an
essay
I
wrote
about
my
cousin.
In
fifth
grade,
a
police
officer
came
in
once
a
week
representing
the
DARE
(Drug
Abuse
Resistance
Education)
program.
At
the
end
of
the
year,
an
essay
contest
was
held
in
which
we
had
to
write
about
our
own
experiences
or
feelings
about
drugs
and
alcohol.
The
winners
of
this
contest
read
their
essays
at
our
DARE
graduation,
a
much
sought-after
prize
at
the
time.
Many
of
my
classmates
wrote
of
the
dangers
of
drugs
and
alcohol
and
what
they
had
learned
from
DARE,
but
I
chose
to
write
about
a
much
more
personal
experience
involving
my
cousin,
Darin,
who
was
hit
by
a
drunk
driver
a
few
months
earlier.
Darin
was
in
a
coma
for
months,
had
brain
damage,
and
spent
months
at
a
rehabilitation
center
because
of
a
man
who
chose
to
drink
and
drive.
Writing
this
essay
required
me
to
interview
members
of
my
family
and
have
them
critique
my
account,
which
often
was
not
easy.
My
teachers
praised
my
work
and
selected
my
essay
to
be
read
at
graduation.
It
was
not
until
Mrs.
Mayer's
seventh
grade
social
studies
class,
however,
that
I
wrote
my
first
extensive
research
paper.
The
assignment
was
to
write
a
seven-page
paper
on
the
Navajo
tribe
of
Native
Americans,
and
for
the
first
time,
I
was
to
include
footnotes
and
a
bibliography
with
at
least
three
sources.
At
first
I
really
dreaded
the
assignment
(as
Native
Americans
were
not
my
favorite
topic
to
research
and
seven
pages
seemed
extremely
long).
To
my
surprise,
however,
I
began
to
find
the
process
of
finding
new
sources
of
information
--
pictures
and
documents
detailing
the
Navajo
culture
-
quite
enjoyable.
The
seven-page
requirement
quickly
turned
into
an
eighteen-page
paper,
complete
with
photos,
diagrams
and
a
bibliography
with
over
ten
varied
sources
of
information.
Writing
the
paper
consumed
much
of
my
time
that
year,
but
it
was
one
of
my
proudest
achievements.
Mrs.
Mayer
was
delighted
with
my
paper
and
the
effort
that
I
had
dedicated
to
it.
I
believe
that
these
early
successes
with
research
writing
contribute
to
my
fondness
for
this
genre
today.
Eighth
grade
marked
the
return
of
the
dreaded
journals.
In
Mr.
Burkhardt's
eighth
grade
English
and
Social
Studies
classes,
I
was
required
to
keep
three
journals:
an
English
Journal,
a
Social
Studies
Journal,
and
a
Reading
Journal.
It
was
no
secret
that
writing
in
these
journals
was
not
my
favorite
assignment.
However,
since
we
were
graded
on
each
entry
I
was
forced
to
at
least
pretend
I
enjoyed
it.
Looking
back
at
my
Social
Studies
Journal
today,
I
find
comments
like
"Fine
work,
Shannon,"
with
smiley
faces,
checkmarks,
and
stars
adorning
the
paper.
Although
I
hated
writing
journal
entries
at
the
time,
I
like
to
read
them
today,
noting
my
reactions
and
opinions
to
events.
In
addition,
I
notice
that
I
continued
to
use
my
journal
as
an
outlet
to
vent
my
frustration
and
anger,
as
I
did
in
the
marble
notebook
for
the
"Shannon
Club"
so
many
years
before.
In
this
sense,
there
are
a
few
aspects
of
journal
writing
that
I
enjoy;
namely,
the
fact
that
in
my
journal,
I
can
be
completely
open
and
honest
and
not
worry
about
how
others
will
react.
My
middle
school
teachers
rarely
criticized
my
writing.
While
I
welcomed
their
overly
emphasized
positive
feedback
at
the
time,
I
believe
this
approach
only
caused
me
to
graduate
middle
school
as
an
over
confident
writer.
Mr.
Seerman's
ninth
grade
English
class
was
a
major
wake
up
call:
The
alarm
was
buzzing,
"Shannon,
you
are
not
the
greatest
writer
to
ever
grace
the
planet."
My
first
submission
was
returned
with
red
lines
and
suggestions
everywhere.
Despite
the
initial
shock,
I
learned
a
great
deal
in
English
that
year.
Mr.
Seerman,
a
former
writer
for
The
New
York
Times,
taught
me
how
to
write
concisely;
to
step
away
from
the
middle-school
approach
--
more
is
better.
At
the
time,
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
fathom
how
a
five-page
paper
could
possibly
be
better
than
a
ten-page
paper,
thinking
that
the
author
of
the
ten-page
piece
obviously
had
put
more
effort
into
the
work.
But
thanks
to
Mr.
Seerman,
I
learned
that
it
is
often
easier
to
go
overboard
with
details.
Even
today
when
I
read
drafts
of
my
papers,
I
find
myself
looking
for
redundant
sentences
and
dangerous
'tangents,'
as
Mr.
Seerman
referred
to
many
of
my
anecdotes
that
did
not
have
any
connection
with
the
purpose
of
the
paper.
Tenth
grade
English
and
Global
Studies
classes
were
feared
by
everyone
who
attended
my
high
school
for
one
reason:
the
thesis
paper.
About
half
way
through
the
year,
every
sophomore
had
to
choose
a
topic
and
formulate
a
thesis
question
to
investigate.
This
project
taught
us
how
to
formulate
a
thesis
statement,
develop
arguments
supporting
the
thesis,
rebut
arguments
against
the
thesis,
and
prepare
a
conclusion,
footnotes
and
a
bibliography.
Furthermore,
each
student
was
required
to
give
a
ten-minute
presentation
defending
our
minimum
ten-page
report.
Thinking
of
a
topic
worthy
of
researching
was
by
itself
a
difficult
task
for
most
of
my
peers,
not
to
mention
the
research
and
writing
that
were
to
follow.
While
most
of
my
classmates
complained
daily
about
the
amount
of
work
that
was
demanded
of
them,
I
found
myself
actually
enjoying
the
research
and
writing.
Although
it
required
a
great
deal
of
dedication,
I
am
grateful
for
the
experience
because
it
left
me
well
prepared
for
much
of
the
writing
I
do
today
at
Lafayette.
It
was
not
until
my
junior
year
of
high
school
that
I
began
to
dabble
with
creative
writing.
I
began
to
write
poetry
in
a
journal
at
home,
but
never
dreamed
that
anyone
else
would
read
it.
In
English
class
we
began
a
poetry
unit
in
which
each
student
wrote
about
some
facet
of
a
town,
and
collectively
our
class
would
invent
our
own
fictional
village.
For
me,
the
hardest
part
about
the
assignment
was
not
composing
the
poem,
but
sharing
it
with
my
classmates.
While
I
excelled
in
argumentative
research-based
writing,
I
did
not
and
still
do
not
consider
creative
writing
one
of
my
strengths.
It
was
no
wonder
that
I
was
shocked,
then,
when
my
teacher
asked
me
to
submit
my
piece
to
the
school's
annual
art-literary
magazine,
Cymbals.
Unlike
many
of
my
fellow
first-year
students,
I
was
never
nervous
about
the
amount
or
difficulty
of
the
writing
I
would
be
assigned
in
college.
Perhaps
that
is
because
it
seems
I
did
nothing
in
my
senior
year
but
write.
With
a
schedule
that
included
both
Advanced
Placement
English,
Advanced
Placement
History
(with
a
teacher
who
was
notorious
for
his
emphasis
on
learning
history
through
reading
and
writing
in
vast
quantities),
I
spent
many
hours
in
front
of
the
computer
screen
typing
reports,
journals,
original
compositions
in
Spanish
and
French,
and
reaction
papers
to
books
I
read.
For
my
AP
History
course
alone,
I
wrote
a
five-page
paper
a
week,
mostly
argumentative
essays
and
responses
to
document-based
questions.
Nearly
every
night
I
was
on
the
phone
with
a
classmate
as
we
discussed
our
papers.
In
English,
we
studied
and
were
required
to
compose
samples
of
all
different
types
of
writing:
argumentative,
expository,
narrative,
etc.
Ms.
Rickerby,
I
quickly
learned,
was
particularly
sensitive
about
word
choice.
When
she
returned
my
first
paper,
I
was
stunned
to
see
that
nearly
every
word
on
the
page
was
circled
with
a
question
like
"is
this
the
exact
word
you
were
looking
for
here
or
can
you
substitute
something
more
precise?"
scribbled
on
the
page.
At
first,
revising
my
writing
and
analyzing
it
literally
word-for-word
was
aggravating
and
seemingly
pointless.
A
word
as
simple
as
"hop"
was
circled,
as
Ms.
Rickerby
asked
if
"skip,"
"jump,"
"leap,"
or
"bounce"
would
be
a
better
choice.
I
soon
realized
that
although
the
task
of
dissecting
each
word
was
frustrating,
it
did
improve
my
writing
dramatically.
During
senior
year,
my
writing
expanded
beyond
the
English
language.
Every
other
week,
I
wrote
a
ten-page
journal
in
French,
which
included
everything
from
my
daily
activities
to
fictional
stories.
Since
the
journal
was
due
on
Friday,
my
Thursday
nights
were
spent
with
a
French
dictionary
and
a
list
of
activities
I
had
done
that
week.
Adjusting
to
the
demands
of
my
first-year
courses
at
Lafayette
was
not
difficult
after
such
a
writing-intensive
senior
year.
Although
many
classmates
had
trouble
with
some
of
the
writing
requirements,
I
was
confident
in
my
abilities
and
preparation.
All
of
the
writing
for
my
FYS
was
in
the
form
of
research
papers,
a
style
I
was
fond
of
and
that
my
high
school
focused
on.
To
my
surprise,
the
course
I
had
the
most
trouble
with
during
my
first
year
was
Spanish.
Since
I
began
studying
the
language
in
sixth
grade,
Spanish
had
always
come
easily
to
me.
When
the
first
paper
was
assigned
in
Advanced
Spanish,
my
overconfidence
was
shattered.
Never
before
had
I
written
more
than
a
paragraph
in
Spanish,
and
the
assignment
asked
us
to
write
at
least
two
pages.
Although
I
had
to
invest
in
and
consult
a
Spanish-English
dictionary
often,
I
was
able
to
produce
three
pages
in
Spanish
that
were
relatively
grammatically
correct.
Since
then,
I
have
written
papers
of
much
greater
length
in
Spanish,
and
have
been
able
to
do
so
with
ease.
Through
my
high
school
and
early
college
experience
I
learned
that
writing
is
not
an
innate
ability
predetermined
before
birth.
Through
revision
and
learning
new
techniques,
writing
well
can
be
an
acquired
skill.
Once
the
basics,
such
as
answering
the
"who,
what,
where,
why,
when,
and
how,"(as
I
learned
by
composing
thank
you
notes
as
a
child)
and
having
a
clear,
concise
thesis
with
relevant
supporting
evidence
are
mastered,
good
writing,
can
be
accomplished
in
much
the
same
way
a
virtuoso
develops
his
or
her
musical
talent
-
through
years
of
practice.
