Literacy
Narrative
NPoppy
come
let
me
read
to
you!O
I
said
to
my
grandfather.
I
was
four
years
old,
and
reading
before
bedtime
was
my
favorite
part
of
the
day.
As
my
grandfather
walked
into
my
bedroom,
I
instructed
him
to
take
a
seat
on
my
bed
as
I
selected
that
eveningOs
story
from
the
array
of
childrenOs
books
that
neatly
lined
my
shelves
and
spilled
onto
my
floor.
My
grandfather
watched
carefully,
and
beamed
with
pride
at
the
thought
of
having
such
a
highly
intelligent
and
advanced
granddaughter.
After
carefully
considering
all
possibilities,
I
selected
a
personal
favorite,
Travels
with
Tess
and
Tim,
and
hurried
back
to
my
patient
grandfather.
I
opened
the
cover
and
confidently
began
reciting
the
words
on
the
page.
After
numerous
readings
I
had
managed
to
memorize
most
of
the
words
in
the
book,
but
was
convinced
that
I
was
reading.
My
grandfather
chuckled
to
himself
and
smiled
approvingly.
To
his
dismay,
I
was
not
a
child
prodigy
who
mastered
the
English
language
before
kindergarten,
and
what
I
was
doing
was
clearly
from
memory.
Nonetheless,
I
enjoyed
the
response
I
would
get
from
people
when
I
NreadO
to
them.
I
saw
the
smiles
on
their
faces
and
the
laughs
that
certain
words
in
the
stories
produced.
I
was
officially
introduced
to
the
world
of
storytelling,
and
begin
to
fall
in
love
with
it.
The
dust
gathered
in
abnormally
large
sized
clumps
and
gradually
began
to
take
over
my
room.
It
tickled
my
nose
and
caused
me
to
sneeze
repeatedly,
not
the
quiet
cute
sounding
sneeze,
but
instead
the
large,
loud
sneeze
that
makes
you
want
to
seek
shelter
when
you
hear
it.
Cleaning
my
room
was
a
heavy
undertaking,
and
after
coming
home
from
my
first
year
at
college,
it
seemed
as
if
my
possessions
had
quadrupled.
As
I
went
through
my
bags
of
clothes
and
books,
I
started
to
go
through
things
that
I
had
left
behind.
In
attempts
to
make
room
for
some
of
the
new
aspects
of
my
life,
I
began
to
open
boxes
and
doors
I
hadnOt
thought
about
for
years.
I
found
boxes
of
summer
camp
photos,
middle
school
gym
awards,
and
old
Beanie
Babies.
A
self-proclaimed
pack
rat,
the
majority
of
these
things
had
not
been
touched
in
quite
some
time,
but
continued
to
take
up
space
in
my
average
sized
bedroom.
On
the
sides
of
my
desk
were
bags
and
bags
of
old
notebooks
filled
with
papers,
tests,
and
homework
assignments.
Despite
their
worthlessness
now,
I
have
an
incredibly
hard
time
parting
with
them.
During
my
cleaning,
I
sat
down
and
strapped
in
for
what
I
assumed
would
be
a
long
trip
down
memory
lane.
Rifling
through
old
spelling
tests
and
short
stories,
I
began
to
go
farther
and
farther
back
in
time.
Green
paper
stuck
out
in
a
mess
of
white
pages
typed
in
Times
New
Roman
font.
Pulling
them
from
the
pile,
I
began
to
remember
what
these
papers
were.
I
was
an
only
child
until
the
age
of
four
and
a
half.
My
mother
had
worked
for
as
long
as
I
could
remember,
while
I
spent
my
days
playing
with
babysitters
and
going
to
daycare
and
preschool.
When
my
younger
sister
Charlotte
was
born,
my
mother
took
time
off
from
work,
just
as
I
began
kindergarten.
By
the
time
the
next
school
year
rolled
around,
my
mother
was
ready
to
go
back
to
work,
and
I
was
ready
to
start
after-school
programs
until
she
came
home.
After
being
used
to
my
momOs
smile
greeting
me
as
I
walked
off
the
bus
after
school,
I
was
filled
with
fear
nerves
about
my
mother
not
being
around.
This
first
day
of
first
grade
was
very
different,
and
I
sheepishly
boarded
the
yellow
school
bus
trying
to
hold
back
my
tears.
As
I
walked
into
the
classroom,
I
met
the
eyes
of
my
teacher,
a
charismatic
white
haired
man
named
Mr.
Burgraff,
or
Mr.
B
as
all
of
his
students
affectionately
called
him.
Though
he
was
in
his
mid-sixties,
he
enthusiastically
took
on
the
challenge
of
teaching
twenty-five
six-and
seven-
year
olds.
As
we
all
took
our
seats,
quiet
buzzing
filled
the
air,
as
we
anxiously
waited
for
what
would
come
next.
Mr.
B
directed
our
attention
to
the
green
chalkboard,
where
todayOs
date
was
written
along
with
a
message.
We
were
to
take
a
piece
of
lined
green
paper
and
copy
the
message
exactly
as
Mr.
B
had
written.
Not
only
was
this
designed
to
help
us
practice
our
penmanship,
it
also
allowed
us
to
come
together
and
create
discussion
over
Mr.
BOs
daily
thoughts.
I
carefully
pressed
my
pencil
to
the
green
paper;
green
paper?
It
seemed
quite
unusual,
but
then
again
Mr.
B
was
an
unusual
teacher.
Class
time
often
consisted
of
Mr.
B
sharing
stories
from
his
colorful
life,
which
had
been
filled
with
girlfriends
and
world
travels.
Regaining
my
focus,
I
turned
my
attention
back
to
the
chalkboard
and
paper,
eager
to
show
him
my
proficient
writing
skills.
Mr.
B
began
walking
around
the
class,
glimpsing
at
other
studentsO
papers,
correcting
mistakes,
and
attempting
to
learn
everyoneOs
names.
When
he
got
to
my
desk
he
glanced
down
at
my
paper,
staring
at
the
NEmilyO
I
had
written,
as
neatly
as
I
could,
in
the
top
left
corner.
I
shyly
smiled
at
him,
and
he
smiled
back.
He
leaned
against
my
desk,
my
paper
in
hand,
and
wrote
an
approving
NBO
within
a
circle
and
said,
NVery
nice
to
meet
you
Emily.O
Every
morning
from
that
day
forward
we
would
diligently
copy
Mr.
BOs
messages
onto
our
green
paper.
These
messages
ranged
from
commentary
on
last
nightOs
KnicksO
game
to
a
classmateOs
new
haircut.
Attendance
was
commented
on,
and
children
who
came
back
from
a
sick
day
were,
Nback
alive!O
My
classmates
and
I
looked
forward
to
the
messages
of
the
day
and
my
parents
got
a
kick
out
of
what
we
were
writing,
laughing
at
some
of
the
messages
that
were
clearly
over
the
heads
of
most
six
year
olds.
The
green
paper
slowly
became
comforting
and
I
grew
more
confident
in
my
writing
as
the
days
went
by.
As
I
looked
back
on
these
green
papers
I
realize
that
my
confidence
grew
twofold
that
year.
As
time
went
by
I
began
to
move
away
from
basic
printing,
and
I
tried
to
write
my
name
in
the
more
ambitious
cursive.
I
also
began
to
let
go
of
my
sadness
and
fears,
and
began
to
feel
more
comfortable
and
secure
in
my
surroundings.
It
was
late
August
and
school
was
just
around
the
corner.
Years
had
gone
by
since
I
left
Mr.
BOs
classroom,
I
had
moved
to
a
new
town
and
school,
and
was
entering
the
eighth
grade.
There
was
a
new
teacher,
Mrs.
Del
Toro,
who
was
assigned
to
eighth
grade
English.
Rumor
had
it
that
she
lived
in
Pleasantville
and,
though
it
was
a
small
town,
I
did
not
know
her.
Walking
into
the
classroom
on
the
first
day,
she
greeted
us
with
an
enthusiastic
smile
and
fortune
cookies
in
hand.
Fortune
cookies
were
her
attempt
to
show
us
that
the
future
is
ours
and
although
some
of
it
may
be
left
to
chance,
it
is
up
to
you
to
make
your
own
life.
My
first
formal
introduction
to
writing
came
that
year,
as
she
instructed
us
in
the
art
of
essay
writing.
I
can
remember
the
upside
down
triangular
diagram
she
used
for
an
introductory
paragraph
and
her
use
of
the
terms
NhookO
and
NthesisO
things
that
were
completely
foreign
to
me
and
my
classmates.
Thanks
to
her
persistence
and
high
expectations,
I
caught
on
very
quickly
to
the
concept
of
theses
and
persuasive
essays.
It
wasnOt
the
kind
of
writing
I
was
used
to,
or
liked
for
that
matter,
but
I
was
able
to
do
it
and
I
understood
its
purpose.
Mrs.
Del
Toro
was
pleased
to
see
how
successful
I
was
becoming
at
executing
a
good
thesis
and
introductory
paragraph.
To
my
embarrassment,
but
perhaps
inner
happiness,
she
read
the
introduction
from
my
essay
on
ShakespeareOs
As
You
Like
It
to
the
class,
using
my
work
as
an
example.
It
felt
good
to
receive
praise
from
a
teacher,
as
well
as
feel
that
someone
believed
in
your
efforts
and
liked
what
you
were
doing.
Sitting
in
the
uncomfortable
library
chair,
I
repeatedly
typed
and
deleted
words
on
my
computer
screen.
After
a
few
more
times,
I
checked
the
word
count:
five
hundred
and
thirty-six,
still
over
my
oppressive
five
hundred
word
limit.
I
had
always
written
as
if
I
were
speaking,
and
though
this
often
created
a
lengthy
product,
I
knew
no
other
way.
In
high
school,
teachers
usually
gave
a
desired
length
for
an
assignment,
but
it
was
mostly
out
of
their
own
selfish
desires
to
escape
grading
mini-novels
over
three
day
weekends.
The
only
time
I
was
seriously
confined
to
a
specific
length
would
be
during
college
essay
writing,
but
even
in
those
cases,
I
carefully
mimicked
the
length
of
one
page
by
gradually
shrinking
my
font
size,
finally
producing
a
single
page
using
size
ten.
Here
I
was,
my
freshman
year
in
college,
struggling
to
write
an
essay
in
five
hundred
words.
If
I
couldnOt
get
through
this
how
would
I
possibly
get
through
three
and
a
half
more
years
as
an
English
major?
I
knew
my
frustrations
were
shared
by
other
members
of
my
first
year
seminar
class,
however,
the
deadline
for
this
paper
was
quickly
approaching
and
I
was
hardly
close
to
being
finished.
Deleting
words
on
a
page
was
like
throwing
away
my
possessions.
No
matter
how
superfluous
they
were,
it
hurt
me
to
see
those
words
go,
almost
as
much
as
it
hurt
to
throw
away
the
Ricky
Martin
CD
I
hadnOt
listen
to
in
five
years.
My
professor
defended
his
strict
limit
by
telling
us
that
we
will
always
have
word
limits
in
the
NrealO
world
and
there
was
not
a
better
time
than
now
to
get
used
to
that
fact.
Despite
the
fact
that
I
would
rather
write
five
hundred
words
on
the
design
and
structure
of
Skillman
library
than
this
uninspiring
assignment,
I
slowly
reread
my
writing.
Though
it
pained
me
to
remove
words
and
sentences
that
I
had
taken
time
to
think
through
and
create,
I
began
to
understand
my
professorOs
message
and
the
importance
of
concise
writing.
I
realized
that
the
ideas
I
had
created
were
all
important
to
the
body
of
my
essay,
however,
I
had
more
than
enough
of
these
ideas
and
at
times
I
was
repeating
myself.
A
word
limit
is
not
prohibiting
me
from
expressing
myself,
but
rather
a
way
to
put
my
best
thoughts
and
ideas
out
into
the
world
in
the
least
amount
of
time.
Thinking
about
my
own
attention
span,
or
lack
thereof,
when
it
came
to
reading
articles
in
magazines
or
newspapers,
my
professor
did
have
a
point.
I
usually
only
read
about
things
that
interest
me,
like
films
or
football,
or
articles
with
shocking
titles
about
outlandish
alien
encounters
that
often
fill
the
pages
of
tabloid
magazines.
A
good
writer
knows
how
to
create
intrigue
and
draw
his
or
her
readers
in
with
just
a
few
words.
If
I
wanted
to
the
attention
of
my
fellow
readers,
as
well
as
my
professor
who
would
be
grading
this
assignment,
I
had
to
abide
by
this
word
limit.
I
had
to
show
him
that
I
was
capable
of
creating
an
interesting
and
insightful
piece
without
going
on
for
pages
and
pages.
After
my
epiphany,
I
returned
my
attention
to
my
computer
screen,
where
my
space
screen
saver
had
been
running
for
the
past
ten
minutes,
and
began
to
write,
and
by
write
I
mean
delete.
The
biggest
obstacle
I
face
with
my
writing
is
myself.
As
I
sit
here
and
attempt
to
write
my
own
literary
history,
I
cannot
help
but
be
filled
with
a
small
amount
of
self
doubt.
I
have
always
loved
writing,
but
I
there
are
times
when
I
feel
like
that
is
not
enough.
In
school,
writing
has
never
felt
like
work
to
me,
and
while
some
of
my
classmates
would
complain
about
the
five
page
essay
due
the
next
day,
I
never
felt
the
same
burden.
Writing
was
something
that
always
came
easy
to
me,
and
I
always
got
positive
responses
from
teachers
and
classmates.
My
mother
has
always
been
my
biggest
fan.
Throughout
school,
and
even
sometimes
in
college,
after
reading
some
of
my
writing,
she
never
ceases
to
respond
with
extreme
enthusiasm
and
compliments.
Even
times
when
I
have
felt
that
something
was
not
my
best
work,
my
mother
always
finds
something
positive
to
comment
on.
There
are
times
when
I
am
not
sure
whether
what
she
is
saying
is
the
truth
or
if
she
is
just
being
a
supportive
parent.
As
I
have
gotten
older
and
have
done
more
and
more
writing
and
have
been
exposed
to
different
writers
and
teachers,
I
have
begun
to
feel
a
bit
self-conscious
about
my
abilities.
Writing
has
never
been
something
that
I
thought
a
lot
about,
it
was
just
something
that
I
enjoyed.
I
would
much
rather
write
a
short
story
or
even
an
essay
on
Shakespeare
than
memorize
the
periodic
table
of
elements
in
a
Chemistry
class.
This
past
year
of
college
has
been
wonderful
and
my
classes
have
reinforced
my
desire
to
be
an
English
major,
but
I
cannot
help
but
be
intimidated
by
some
of
my
peers.
I
know
that
I
have
the
ability
to
write
and
that
I
have
a
good
understanding
of
how
to
execute
an
assignment
and
write
creatively
but
there
are
still
times
when
I
feel
less
than
stellar
when
compared
to
the
students
sitting
next
to
me.
I
have
never
written
on
my
own.
I
donOt
have
pages
and
pages
of
stories
or
poems
hidden
under
my
bed
and
writing
is
not
an
escape
that
I
use
when
I
am
feeling
upset
or
stressed.
I
do
not
know
what
the
future
holds
for
me
or
what
career
path
I
will
choose,
however,
I
do
know
what
I
like.
I
enjoy
words
and
I
enjoy
stories
and
who
knows
where
my
love
of
those
things
will
take
me.
Maybe
only
Mrs.
Del
ToroOs
fortune
cookies
know
for
sure.
