Beyond
Simple
Grammar
and
Spelling
It
all
started
long
before
preschool,
when
my
mother
used
to
have
me
trace
letters
to
practice
my
handwriting.
But
although
this
early
practice
of
drawing
individual
letters
was
clearly
useful
for
me
later
in
life,
I
donOt
think
it
was
something
which
I
would
consider
to
be
actual
writing.
This
practice
of
tracing
letters
was
continued
through
my
preschool
years,
at
times
used
as
a
form
of
punishment
when
I
misbehaved.
As
I
recall,
my
kindergarten
teacher
Mrs.
Mull
was
the
first
individual
who
introduced
me
to
what
genuine
writing
was
all
about
when
my
classmates
and
I
would
write
short
sentences
in
her
class.
Second
grade
was
when
students
in
my
school
district
learned
to
write
in
cursive,
and
I
really
struggled
with
this
style
of
writing.
My
mom
bought
me
erasable
pens
because
I
would
mess
up
so
much.
However
something
must
have
clicked
in
the
next
year
because
I
placed
third
in
my
classO
handwriting
competition
in
third
grade,
an
honor
which
made
me
very
proud
at
the
time.
I
had
to
copy
in
pencil
words
such
as
NNorm,O
NUhla,O
and
NZeusO
onto
my
paper
and
make
mine
look
as
similar
to
the
original
as
possible.
It
should
be
mentioned
however
that
I
can
no
longer
write
in
cursive
because
I
have
always
liked
printing
letters
better.
Another
childhood
memory
I
have
is
of
plays
I
used
to
write
for
my
family
to
perform.
Thanksgiving
was
always
held
at
my
house,
and
I
would
always
write
a
play
for
the
members
of
my
immediate
and
extended
family
to
act
out.
I
thought
that
this
was
the
biggest
thing
in
the
world
and
looked
forward
to
it
for
weeks!
One
of
the
scores
which
I
kept
was
called
Champlain.
The
three
act
play
consisted
of
less
than
two
pages
of
typed
lines
and
directions,
but
managed
to
incorporate
a
stunning
fifteen
characters!
To
be
critical
of
this
early
childhood
work,
the
lines
are
poorly
written
and
many
are
more
like
stage
directions
than
words
that
should
actually
be
said
in
a
play.
However
the
important
thing
with
these
plays
was
that
I
was
exposing
myself
to
the
genre
of
theatre
and
voluntarily
practicing
my
writing
abilities.
I
suppose
itOs
also
important
that
my
whole
family
was
supporting
my
early
love
for
acting.
There
should
be
mention
in
this
story
of
my
inability
to
consistently
keep
journals.
I
tried
many
times
in
my
late
elementary
and
early
middle
school
years
to
log
daily
or
at
least
on
a
frequent
basis
in
a
simple
binder
about
what
was
happening
in
my
life.
This
is
something
I
wish
I
could
have
done
better
because
I
would
like
to
go
back
now
and
take
a
look
at
my
past
experiences.
One
failed
journal
in
particular
which
I
remember
was
a
Harry
Potter
journal
my
parents
bought
me
hoping
it
would
encourage
me
to
write
more.
I
logged
in
it
twice.
The
first
time
I
wrote
a
short
story
about
how
it
was
snowing
in
April.
The
second
was
when
my
best
friend
and
I
got
into
a
big
fight
on
my
dadOs
birthday.
In
eighth
grade,
I
had
an
English
teacher
that
focused
his
whole
class
on
writing,
whereas
most
of
my
English
up
to
that
point
had
been
grammar,
spelling,
and
vocabulary.
Mr.
Cromwell
really
encouraged
me
to
go
beyond
what
I
was
comfortable
with
and
introduced
me
to
several
new
styles
of
writing.
He
let
us
pick
what
we
wanted
to
write
about
and
also
how
we
wanted
to
write
it,
the
freedom
of
which
I
really
took
advantage
of
by
exploring
genres
such
as
short
stories,
non-fiction,
poems,
and
of
course
plays.
He
asked
me
questions
about
my
writing
which
went
beyond
simple
grammar
and
spelling.
One
piece
in
particular
which
I
still
have
is
a
poem
titled
NPawOs
Poem.O
I
wrote
it
shortly
after
my
great-grandfather
passed
away
that
year
as
a
reminder
to
me
of
the
relationship
the
two
of
us
shared.
The
poem
starts
out,
NMy
great-grandpa
died
last
Sunday.
With
wings
like
those
of
an
eagle,
He
ascended
into
heaven
above.
Paw
was
my
grandmaOs
father.
He
was
ninety-four
when
his
day
came.
He
lived
in
the
smoky
mountains,
In
the
smallest
hamlet
of
Seymour
in
Tennessee.O
Mr.
Cromwell
believed
that
this
piece
sounded
more
like
a
narrative
of
sorts
to
him,
and
thought
I
should
change
its
form.
However
I
kept
it
as
a
poem,
and
took
the
resulting
grade
deduction
for
not
giving
in.
From
this
point
on
in
my
writing
career,
I
have
tended
to
take
constructive
criticism
as
a
suggestion
for
change
rather
than
a
demand.
If
I
feel
as
if
I
got
it
right
in
my
original
draft
and
that
the
teacher
or
professor
disagrees,
well
I
think
that
itOs
my
piece
of
writing
and
therefore
needs
to
remain
full
of
my
thoughts.
Although
this
eighth
grade
teacher
of
mine
and
I
may
not
have
gotten
along
the
best,
I
know
that
I
would
not
be
where
I
am
now
if
he
hadnOt
had
such
an
impact
on
my
writing.
Probing
questions
about
the
thought
process
which
goes
into
writing
are
so
much
more
important
than
simple
proofreading
errors
in
a
paper,
and
Mr.
Cromwell
was
the
first
man
who
pointed
that
out
to
me
in
my
writing
career.
High
school
was
a
low
spot
for
my
writing.
The
English
department
at
James
Buchanan
was
and
is
still
simply
horrible,
and
IOm
not
afraid
to
speak
badly
of
my
alma
mater
when
something
is
as
true
as
that
is.
The
only
moderately
acceptable
English
teacher
I
had
was
Miss
Gossert
during
my
freshman
year
of
high
school.
My
junior
year
for
Honors
English
I
was
taught
by
a
NDoctorO
who
apparently
bought
his
degree
on
eBay
somehow
and
you
wouldnOt
believe
it
was
possible
until
you
met
the
man.
My
senior
year
I
took
Advanced
Placement
(AP)
English,
as
IOm
sure
many
Lafayette
students
did,
however
I
had
a
quite
different
experience
than
I
would
imagine
anyone
else
did.
Not
to
get
on
my
soapbox
here,
but
my
AP
English
experience
consisted
of
absolutely
no
formal
papers
and
we
read
none
of
the
books
which
were
listed
as
possible
books
for
the
AP
exam.
We
had
one
test
all
year,
and
this
was
during
the
second
week
of
class
on
a
short
story
that
we
read
a
small
portion
of.
I
honestly
canOt
imagine
how
a
singular
class
could
prepare
me
for
the
rigors
of
college
writing
less
than
what
Ms.
HouseOs
AP
English
class
did.
I
think
that
my
writing
probably
benefited
more
from
my
history
and
social
studies
classes
in
high
school
than
it
did
from
my
English
classes.
History
classes
encouraged
me
to
think
more
in
depth
about
what
I
was
writing
about.
Believe
it
or
not,
I
only
wrote
one
research
paper
in
all
of
high
school,
and
this
was
in
my
tenth
grade
world
history
class.
I
wrote
several
book
reports
and
essays
in
economics,
government,
and
psychology
which
implemented
more
critical
thinking
and
the
occasional
citations
but
nothing
similar
to
the
papers
IOve
been
assigned
at
Lafayette
thus
far.
After
my
sophomore
year
of
high
school,
I
attended
a
state-funded
five
week
summer
program
called
the
Pennsylvania
GovernorOs
School
for
Agricultural
Sciences
(PGSAS).
This
prestigious
academic
setting
forced
me
to
learn
to
write
fast,
as
I
had
to
produce
a
lengthy
research
paper
which
I
worked
on
with
a
Pennsylvania
State
University
professor.
I
worked
with
Penn
StateOs
Dr.
Sanford
S.
Smith
of
the
Forestry
Department.
I
assisted
Dr.
Smith
with
research
on
the
topic
of
mentored
hunting
in
Pennsylvania
and
how
this
compared
to
youth
hunting
experiences
in
other
states
in
America.
Dr.
Smith
was
able
to
help
challenge
me
to
write
beyond
a
high
school
level
because
he
himself
was
teaching
on
a
college
level
and
therefore
this
experience
was
clearly
the
best
preparation
I
had
for
college.
Additionally,
it
was
probably
the
best
writing
experience
IOve
had
thus
far
in
my
life
because
of
the
close
contact
I
got
to
have
with
an
expert
in
the
field.
To
counter
the
wonderful
experience
of
working
with
Dr.
Smith
on
mentored
hunting
research,
I
have
to
mention
the
Standardized
Assessment
Tests
(SATs).
These
were
clearly
the
worst
writing
experiences
of
my
life.
First,
the
test
gave
you
twenty-five
minutes
to
write
a
complete
essay
which
led
to
a
miserable,
poorly
written
paper
for
everyone
involved.
But
to
make
things
worse,
each
time
I
took
the
SATs
I
had
to
write
out
a
pledge
not
to
discuss
the
test
with
anyone
else
on
the
back
of
the
test
booklet
in
cursive!
As
discussed
earlier,
I
can
no
longer
write
in
this
style,
and
therefore
struggled
a
lot
with
this
assignment
and
had
to
come
back
to
it
after
I
would
finish
other
sections
of
the
test!
Being
a
resident
of
Pennsylvania,
I
also
had
to
complete
a
Ngraduation
projectO
during
my
high
school
career.
This
project
consists
of
a
MLA
style
paper
and
a
brief
oral
presentation
to
a
group
of
fellow
students.
Everyone
always
complained
about
the
latter
assignment,
but
I
donOt
think
that
standing
up
for
five
minutes
and
talking
to
your
friends
about
something
of
your
choice
is
really
that
bad.
I
did
my
graduation
project
on
Agricultural
Sales,
a
contest
I
competed
in
for
several
years
in
FFA
on
both
the
state
and
national
level
and
did
quite
well
in.
So
this
paper
was
my
third
and
last
NmajorO
writing
project
I
had
in
high
school,
the
first
two
being
my
world
history
research
paper
and
my
GovernorOs
School
research
project
in
conjunction
with
Dr.
Smith.
When
I
graduated
from
high
school,
I
wasnOt
sure
what
to
expect
at
Lafayette
College.
I
knew
that
it
would
be
a
tough
liberal
arts
institution
that
would
challenge
me
in
many
areas,
but
that
was
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
I
chose
it.
I
came
to
college
knowing
that
my
high
school
has
a
horrible
reputation
in
just
about
every
area
possible,
and
that
I
am
the
first
student
from
my
school
district
to
ever
attend
Lafayette.
But
I
took
on
the
challenge
with
a
smile.
I
came
to
orientation
without
knowing
a
sole
and
soon
made
friends
who
helped
introduce
me
to
what
writing
is
really
all
about.
I
would
say
that
James
Buchanan
clearly
hadnOt
adequately
prepared
me
for
the
rigors
of
college
writing
because
there
were
so
many
new
things
that
I
had
to
learn
that
it
seemed
like
my
classmates
already
knew.
For
instance,
before
my
First
Year
Seminar
I
had
no
idea
what
the
difference
between
an
analytical
and
an
argumentative
essay
was
and
I
was
confused
as
to
how
I
was
supposed
to
write
in
a
formal
tone.
I
donOt
know
if
perhaps
the
Lafayette
students
who
went
to
preparatory
high
schools
had
a
leg
up
on
the
public
school
educated
such
as
myself,
or
for
that
matter
how
other
public
school
students
feel
they
were
prepared
for
Lafayette,
but
I
know
that
I
wish
I
could
have
had
a
better
high
school
writing
experience.
As
all
freshmen
are
required
to
do,
I
took
a
First
Year
Seminar
last
fall,
which
I
believe
did
help
me
to
understand
what
would
be
expected
of
me
in
college
writing.
If
it
hadnOt
been
for
that
class
though,
I
would
have
been
somewhere
picking
dandelions
out
in
left
field
because
I
had
two
very
large
research
papers
for
a
government
and
a
history
class
that
semester
as
well
and
I
learned
very
fast
that
some
college
professors
just
assume
you
know
how
to
do
things
rather
than
take
the
time
to
explain
in
detail
what
youOre
to
do
and
I
struggled
with
this
process
for
a
while
during
my
first
college
semester.
Last
spring
is
when
I
think
things
really
started
to
click
for
me
as
an
advanced
writer.
I
had
two
classes
in
particular
which
encouraged
me
to
think
about
what
I
was
writing
rather
than
just
type
out
words
on
the
computer
screen.
Between
these
two
classes,
I
probably
spent
eighty
percent
of
my
homework
time,
as
opposed
to
twenty
percent
on
the
other
two.
It
paid
off
on
the
report
card,
but
thatOs
not
the
important
thing.
The
reason
for
including
this
in
my
life
story
on
writing
is
that
these
two
professors,
who
taught
Introduction
to
American
Studies
and
College
Writing,
were
the
second
and
third
people
after
Mr.
Cromwell
to
show
me
that
writing
is
about
the
in
depth
questions.
Neither
of
these
men
ever
pointed
out
a
grammatical
error
or
a
spelling
mistake
in
one
of
the
many
papers
I
wrote
for
them,
and
they
shouldnOt
have
to
on
a
college
level
assignment.
But
what
they
did
do
is
ask
me
questions
about
what
I
was
writing
about.
Why
did
I
include
mention
of
a
particular
expertOs
point
of
view?
Or
what
was
my
reasoning
for
putting
my
points
in
the
particular
order
I
did?
After
a
while
I
started
asking
myself
these
questions
when
writing
assignments
and
it
clearly
made
me
a
better
writer
through
the
course
of
the
semester.
I
feel
as
if
these
two
classes
in
particular
have
prepared
me
for
the
writing
associate
position.
I
look
forward
to
expanding
my
writing
skills
throughout
the
remainder
of
my
time
at
Lafayette
and
throughout
the
rest
of
my
life
because
writing
is
clearly
a
lifelong
skill.
I
feel
confident
that
in
ten
years
from
now
I
will
be
able
to
say
that
Lafayette
prepared
me
for
the
rest
of
my
life
better
than
James
Buchanan
prepared
me
for
Lafayette,
and
that
will
be
for
a
large
part
due
to
the
writing
program
at
Lafayette.
