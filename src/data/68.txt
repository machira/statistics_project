"Okay.
It's
10:00.
Reading
group
number
one
and
group
number
two
meet
up."
Third
grade
reading
time
was
dreadful
for
me.
See,
what
group
one
and
two
meant
was
that
one
was
accelerated
and
two
was
just
the
average
cluster
of
kids
reading
together.
I
was
group
two,
the
average
camp.
Tara,
my
best
friend
was
in
group
number
one.
In
third
grade
this
became
a
grave
complication
in
my
life.
The
predicament
was
terrifying
for
me.
Tara
and
I
were
supposed
to
be
exactly
alike.
We
both
had
long
hair
and
green
eyes.
We
lived
next
to
each
other.
We
liked
the
same
cute
boys
and
we
both
loved
Hawaiian
Punch
and
chocolate
cupcakes
in
our
Smurf
lunch
boxes.
So
it
came
as
a
great
shock
to
discover
that
we
were
different
in
something.
It
was
even
more
frightening
to
find
out
that
I
was
the
one
who
lacked
in
the
brains
department.
and
Tara,
exactly
the
same,
except
that
Tara
was
smarter.
Being
in
the
average
group
was
perfectly
fine
-
in
fact
I
was
normal
for
my
age.
However,
it
was
more
than
that
in
third
grade.
I
was
quarantined
off
to
one
corner
of
the
classroom
with
the
other
average
kids
while
Tara
traveled
to
the
opposite
corner
to
do
the
smarter
stuff.
As
silly
as
it
may
sound,
this
is
where
my
writing
complex
begins.
Ever
since
my
third
year
in
elementary
school
I
have
been
self
conscious
about
my
writing.
Every
year
I
gain
a
little
more
confidence,
probably
amounting
to
the
size
of
a
grain
of
salt,
but
surely
I
am
reestablishing
my
abilities
and
my
confidence
as
a
writer.
It
happened
that
it
took
seven
years
until
I
actually
received
the
kind
of
support
I
needed
to
gain
more
assurance
in
my
writing.
Mrs.
Campbell
was
my
eleventh
grade
American
Studies
teacher.
But
she
was
also
my
good
friend's
mother.
This
meant
that
I
saw
her
inside
the
classroom
with
her
pumps
and
her
beige
sweaters
on
and
at
home
with
her
glasses,
her
favorite
sweats,
and
a
big
cup
of
coffee.
She
became
a
very
comforting
figure
in
my
history
because
she
allowed
herself
to
be
so
open
to
me.
Mrs.
Campbell
turned
out
to
be
the
turning
point
in
my
writing
career.
American
Studies
was
a
college
track
English
and
history
class.
Mrs.
Campbell
taught
the
English
portion
and
lead
discussions
on
The
Great
Gatsbv
and
The
Old
Man
and
The
Sea.
Her
favorite
tool
to
start
our
elaborate
conversations
was
the
blue
book
journals.
We
would
have
outside
topics
to
write
on,
touching
on
themes
and
major
imagery
-
technical
English
work.
But
most
often
Mrs.
Campbell
would
have
us
free
write
in-class
journal
responses.
She
would
throw
out
a
question
or
comment
and
urge
us
to
openly
respond.
Precisely
at
1:25
we
would
put
our
pens
down
and
Mrs.
Campbell
would
scan
the
circle
of
students
targeting
people
to
read
their
entries.
My
heart
would
pound,
my
palms
would
sweat,
and
I
would
look
everywhere
but
where
Mrs.
Campbell
was
sitting.
This
was
my
worst
nightmare.
I
could
not
share
my
writing.
I
could
talk
as
much
as
I
wanted,
but
to
read
what
I
wrote
on
the
page
in
my
blue
notebook
-
I
just
could
not
do
it.
I
was
too
self
conscious
about
my
writing.
I
never
felt
it
was
good
enough.
The
anxiety
of
this
event
proved
to
be
too
much
for
me.
I
would
panic,
my
face
would
turn
scarlet
red,
my
voice
would
crack,
then
I
would
read
as
fast
as
I
possibly
could.
Eventually
I
had
to
put
an
end
to
this.
After
a
few
tries
I
could
take
no
more.
Finally,
I
talked
to
Mrs.
Campbell.
I
related
what
a
terrifying
experience
this
was
for
me
and
how
I
felt
my
comments
were
never
grand
enough
to
be
read
out
loud.
In
situations
like
this
I
always
felt
as
if
my
classmates
were
judging
me.
All
over
again
I
was
in
third
grade,
back
in
group
number
two,
only
trying
to
sneak
into
the
smart
troop.
I
did
not
want
to
be
alienated.
I
believed
that
if
others
did
not
like
what
I
wrote,
or
if
they
thought
it
was
common
and
average,
then
I
would
be
shunned
in
class
or
talked
about
in
the
high
school
hallways.
Looking
back
I
seem
terribly
paranoid,
but
no
one
wants
their
weakest
point
displayed
to
a
class
full
of
smarter
peers.
Mrs.
Campbell
understood.
She
did
not
agree
with
my
so-called
lack
of
writing
talent,
but
she
was
kind
enough
to
let
me
off
the
hook
with
reading
the
journals.
Instead
I
became
the
person
who
was
called
on
when
no
one
would
answer
a
question.
Nevertheless
this
was
paradise
for
me
compared
to
the
reading
of
my
free
responses.
What
Mrs.
Campbell
also
did
was
she
never
stopped
encouraging
me.
I
would
get
"Nice,"
"Yes,"
and
"Good
Insight"
written
in
the
margins
of
my
paper
-
along
with
the
mistakes
and
awkward
sentences.
However,
the
extra
comments
really
made
me
take
a
second
look
at
what
I
was
writing
and
thinking.
What
I
had
been
accustomed
to
were
red
inked
comments
of
things
that
were
"wrong"
with
my
papers.
And
this
was
all
I
had
to
learn
by.
I
always
knew
my
mistakes,
but
I
never
knew
my
strong
points.
Mrs.
Campbell
changed
that.
Now
when
I
would
get
my
papers
back
Mrs.
Campbell
would
remark
on
my
syntax
or
the
way
I
would
make
transitions.
Sometimes
she
would
just
mention
how
nice
a
sentence
sounded.
But
the
point
was
that
she
was
encouraging
me
the
best
way
she
knew
how.
Her
green
ink
in
margins
of
my
white
paper
where
no
longer
gasps
of
breaths
and
me
thinking
"Oh
God,
what
did
I
do
wrong
now?"
Instead
they
were
batches
of
smiles
that
would
burst
with
encouragement.
Luckily
I
had
Mrs.
Campbell
for
two
years.
My
senior
year
I
took
the
plunge
and
signed
up
for
Advanced
Placement
English.
The
work
load
was
more
challenging,
I
wrote
a
great
deal
more,
still
managed
good
grades,
yet
those
dreaded
journal
assignments
still
lingered
heavily
in
the
air.
No
matter
what
I
did
I
could
not
escape
the
deep
feelings
of
pressure
that
I
felt
weighing
on
my
shoulders.
However,
one
day
Mrs.
Campbell
handed
back
our
journals
after
their
weekly
grading.
She
turned
to
address
the
class
and
stated
how
we
were
going
to
go
around
the
room
and
read
the
journal
entries
that
she
had
highlighted.
1
turned
to
my
page
and
discovered
that
the
marked
passage
was
a
very
personal
free
writing
of
an
experience
that
I
had
the
previous
summer.
At
the
bottom
of
the
page
was
a
note
from
Mrs.
Campbell.
She
wrote:
"Julie,
To
my
writer
who
does
not
see
herself
as
a
writer
-
My
graduation
gift
for
you
would
be
the
pair
of
glasses
I
wear
when
I
see
you
...
Please
share
with
us."
(To
this
day
I
still
have
this
journal
entry
with
the
note
from
her.)
When
my
eyes
hit
the
green
penned
comment
I
could
not
say
no
to
her
anymore.
Mrs.
Campbell
was
like
a
mother
to
me.
I
knew
her
well
and
her
writing
this
made
me
rethink
my
writing
abilities.
Maybe
I
should
try
to
participate
more
often.
Or
maybe
I
should
simply
listen
to
my
teacher
and
friend
and
believe
that
I
am
no
longer
the
embarrassed
little
girl
in
group
number
two.
Finally
I
was
bumped
up
into
group
number
one.
I
should
be
proud
of
it
and
accept
the
responsibilities
that
came
along
with
it.
This
included
having
a
better
sense
of
my
writing
and
the
willingness
to
share
it
in
order
to
keep
on
improving.
Mrs.
Campbell
succeeded.
At
last
I
began
to
see
myself
as
a
writer
and
not
just
a
student
answering
an
essay
question.
With
this
new
boost
in
my
self
esteem
I
made
the
leap
to
Lafayette.
I
was
brimming
with
confidence
by
the
time
the
summer
ended.
I
just
graduated,
I
had
a
great
summer
vacation,
and
I
was
going
to
experience
something
new.
The
academic
challenge
did
not
even
frighten
me.
I
decided
to
take
my
classes
very
seriously
and
I
worked
really
hard
to
maintain
a
successful
grade
point
average.
Even
my
First
Year
Seminar
went
smoothly.
The
main
glitches
I
discovered
where
still
small
grammatical
or
technical
errors.
Often
my
professors
would
tell
me
about
my
interchanging
of
which
and
that
or
than
and
then.
To
me
these
did
not
enter
as
major
difficulties
in
my
writing.
These
were
challenges
that
I
could
overcome
by
simply
looking
into
the
St.
Martin's
Handbook
or
by
revising.
This
little
insight
proved
to
be
my
most
rewarding
college
tool.
Revising
was
so
simple.
I
would
type
the
meat
of
my
paper,
reread
to
elaborate
some
of
my
thoughts
or
to
clarify
some
statements.
And
then
I
would
read
again.
It
was
the
simplest
thing
I
could
possibly
do
to
improve
my
writing.
And
it
definitely
worked.
By
the
time
my
final
draft
was
ready
to
be
handed
in
I
had
read
it
and
improved
it
at
least
five
times.
Some
may
find
this
to
be
an
over
kill,
but
I
stand
by
revision
as
the
key
to
college
level
writing.
Professors
expect
a
fine
crafted
paper.
Revision
is
the
only
service
that
can
make
my
papers
tight
and
clean.
Revising
I
learned
by
myself
in
college.
But
I
discovered
a
greater
instrument
in
my
writing
from
Dr.
O.
I
have
always
pursued
my
papers
with
a
relaxed,
casual,
sometimes
conversational
pen.
Sometimes
it
can
be
a
burden
to
try
to
elevate
my
language
and
to
stop
showing
my
emotions.
However,
Dr.
O
noticed
that
my
style
worked
with
certain
topics
and
papers.
It
seemed
that
my
style
gave
a
fresh
approach
to
the
issues
that
I
undertook.
Dr.
O
recognized
the
deep
emotional
thread
in
my
writing
and
taught
me
to
heighten
my
writing
by
combining
the
emotional
with
the
technical
aspects
of
a
paper.
With
the
melding
of
the
two
forces
I
established
a
style
that
seemed
refreshing
and
new.
The
reader
could
actually
tell
that
I
was
interested
in
what
I
was
writing.
It
appeared
that
with
the
right
combination
of
feeling
and
academic
work
I
could
tap
into
a
current
of
ability,
imagination,
zest
and
performance
that
could
surpass
the
basic,
blank,
sterile
paper.
These
were
the
major
events
in
my
writing
history.
But
I
must
stress
that
it
is
not
nearly
close
to
the
end
of
the
tale.
I
am
sure
that
the
Writing
Associate
position
will
prove
to
be
the
most
challenge
experience
of
my
ever-growing
epic.
Soon
I
will
have
another
chapter
to
add
to
life
story.
