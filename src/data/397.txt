Lessons
in
Writing
Just
be
quiet.
That
was
all
I
had
to
do.
My
first
memory
as
a
writer
comes
at
the
tender
age
of
three.
When
my
parents
moved
to
Southborough,
Massachusetts,
they
met
with
an
architect
on
several
occasions
to
discuss
renovation
plans.
At
the
last
of
these
meetings
they
could
not
find
a
babysitter,
and
I
was
forced
to
attend,
bribed
by
a
chocolate
ice
cream
cone
to
sit
quietly.
To
this
day
ice
cream
is
ample
bribe
for
me,
and
so
I
sat
on
the
floor
of
the
architectOs
pristine
office,
noiselessly
coloring
in
my
Mickey
Mouse
coloring
book
for
the
entirety
of
the
hour
meeting.
At
last
the
meeting
ended.
My
parents
shook
the
architectOs
hand
and
thanked
him,
as
he
enthusiastically
assured
them
that
he
was
pleased
to
help.
He
even
complimented
them
on
their
well
behaved
daughter,
still
sitting
in
the
corner,
content
to
color.
Not
until
the
unsuspecting
adults
crossed
the
room
to
pick
me
up
did
they
see
it:
the
Crayola
red
M-O-L-L-Y
brightly
written
in
a
three-year
oldOs
best
print,
spanning
the
seat
of
the
architectOs
pink
satin
chair.
Lesson
in
writing
number
one:
do
not
write
on
the
furniture.
The
lessons
over
the
next
ten
years
came
like
pitches
in
a
baseball
gameNfast,
continuous,
and
mingled
with
curve
balls.
Just
as
starting
pitchers
differ
from
relief
pitchers,
and
righties
have
different
deliveries
than
lefties,
the
teachers
at
my
elementary
and
middle
schools
used
various
methods
as
well.
From
spelling
bees,
to
comma
rules,
to
thesis
statements,
I
took
what
a
teacher
threw
at
me
and
applied
the
new
knowledge
to
my
writing.
While
the
differences
between
nouns
and
verbs
were
concrete,
the
nuances
which
separated
linking
from
helping
verbs
were
often
unclear.
Nonetheless
I
learned
them
both,
meanwhile
adding
adverbs,
adjectives,
and
pronouns
to
my
repertoire.
Mrs.
Sullivan,
my
sixth
grade
English
teacher,
would
be
happy
to
hear
that
not
only
can
I
still
recite
the
fifty
prepositions
in
alphabetical
order
(about,
above
across,
after,
againstE),
but
I
never
end
a
sentence
with
one
either.
The
jump
from
elementary
to
middle
school
writing
was
big.
I
was
no
longer
expected
to
merely
focus
on
grammar
rules;
rather,
I
was
expected
to
incorporate
these
rules
into
more
advanced
writing.
I
learned
the
importance
of
organizing
my
thoughts
to
more
efficiently
communicate
them
to
others.
Brainstorming
webs
became
outlines,
which,
in
turn,
spawned
five
paragraph
essays.
With
eighth
grade
came
Mrs.
WoodOs
essay
map:
a
blueprint
for
the
art
of
persuasive
writing.
AGG's
(attention
grabbing
generalizations),
SLEWSI's
(specific
life
examples
with
sensory
images),
MIPOs
(main
ideas
in
paragraph),
SIPOs
(supporting
ideas
in
paragraph),
RINGERs
and
ZINGERs
(catchy
closing
lines)
defined
my
writing
over
the
next
year.
The
idea
behind
Mrs.
WoodOs
teaching
was
to
grab
a
readerOs
interest
in
the
opening
line
of
an
essay,
lure
him
to
read
the
thesis
statement,
convince
him
the
essay
was
worth
reading
while
maintaining
his
interest
throughout,
and
mesmerize
him
with
a
powerful
closing
line
that
drives
home
the
thesis.
I
still
remember
the
example
she
used
to
explain
the
map
to
our
class.
NButts
are
everywhere,O
she
began,
and
then
explained
to
a
giggling
but
attentive
class
that
cigarette
butts
are
a
major
pollution
concern
in
todayOs
society.
With
the
help
of
the
essay
map,
I
wrote
the
winning
essay
in
the
Southborough
Rotary
ClubOs
annual
essay
contest.
Middle
School
introduced
yet
another
type
of
writing
that
proved
pertinent
throughout
my
high
school
years.
In
sixth
grade
our
end-of-the-year
project
was
the
Medieval
BanquetNa
grand
affair
to
which
the
entire
grade
came
in
costume
with
parents
in
tow
for
a
night
of
sixteenth-century
food
and
entertainment.
In
English
class,
each
student
had
to
write,
memorize
and
perform
a
short
story
modeled
after
the
Canterbury
Tales.
From
each
of
five
English
classes,
one
student
was
elected
by
his
teacher
and
peers
to
perform
his
story
on
the
banquet
night.
My
story,
NDesdemona
the
Grand
DuchessO,
won
this
honor,
and
I
gained
invaluable
lessons
from
the
experience.
I
was
introduced
to
the
concept
of
writing
for
an
audience
and
learned
about
a
new
genre
from
my
own
work
and
from
the
performances
of
my
classmates.
I
learned
that
the
foundation
for
acting
was
strong
writing.
I
learned
that
writing
was
a
wonderful
tool
to
explain
my
own
opinions
and
to
shape
the
opinions
of
others.
Opportunities
to
use
this
tool
in
a
public
way
were
plentiful
over
the
next
few
years.
Every
year
since
seventh
grade
I
made
a
speech
to
my
classmates
asking
them
to
vote
for
me
in
the
annual
student
council
elections.
By
my
senior
year
in
high
school,
I
was
elected
president.
This
role
brought
even
more
opportunities
for
me
to
publicly
voice
my
opinion.
I
spoke
at
pep
rallies,
award
ceremonies,
town
meetings,
and
even
at
a
student
assembly
after
the
bombing
of
the
World
Trade
Center
on
September
11,
2001.
At
the
root
of
each
of
these
speeches
was
a
carefully
written
text.
In
addition
to
speech
writing,
I
was
soon
to
experience
a
related
form
of
writing
as
old
as
the
United
States
itselfNthe
letter
to
the
editor.
When
a
local
coalition
attempted
to
deregionalize
my
high
school,
and
almost
succeeded
in
doing
so,
I
expressed
my
contrary
opinion
in
several
letters
to
the
editors
of
local
newspapers.
However,
it
was
not
until
a
prominent
member
of
the
community
told
me
that
my
letters
changed
his
vote
that
I
truly
began
to
understand
the
power
of
writing.
My
writing
improved
steadily
throughout
my
high
school
career.
Each
teacher,
paper,
and
test
contributed
to
my
growth
as
a
writer.
Freshman
year,
Mrs.
Novick
encouraged
me
to
have
confidence
in
my
thoughts
and
helped
me
to
eliminate
the
passive
voice
in
my
writing.
Sophomore
year,
Ms.
Burdette
convinced
me
that
an
essay
with
interesting
verbs
and
word
arrangement
attracted
much
more
attention
than
the
ordinary
essay.
She
suggested
that
writing
poetry
was
excellent
practice
for
other
forms
of
writing
because
it
focused
so
intently
on
word
choice
and
word
combinations.
The
following
year,
Ms.
Bell
introduced
me
to
the
practice
of
reading
my
work
out
loudNa
technique
which
I
use
often
and
find
extremely
helpful.
In
so
doing,
mistakes
often
become
glaringly
obvious.
Furthermore,
she
suggested
that
I
read
my
sentences
in
reverse
order;
this
approach,
though
time
consuming
can
often
eliminate
word
repetition
otherwise
overlooked.
Though
computers
are
marvels
of
efficiency,
they
nonetheless
devalue
the
importance
of
proofreading.
With
spell-checks
and
thesauruses
available
at
the
click
of
the
mouse,
it
becomes
easier
to
forgo
the
all
important
editing
phase
of
the
writing
process.
Ms.
BellOs
technique
is
useful
in
eliminating
the
problems
computers
miss;
mistakes
can
be
found
and
corrected
before
it
is
too
late.
As
I
wrote
college
entry
essays,
this
method
was
particularly
helpful.
Daunting
as
it
was
to
creatively
answer
the
question
thousands
of
other
capable
applicants
were
also
answering,
this
simple
method
gave
me
confidence.
As
I
read
my
work
aloud,
fixed
my
mistakes,
and
reread
an
improved
essay,
I
knew
that
my
essay
was
at
least
grammatically
correct.
I
also
knew
that
my
message
was
clearer
and
more
readable,
if
not
more
interesting.
Mr.
Retman,
my
AP
English
teacher,
walked
us
over
the
bridge
from
high
school
to
college
level
writing.
He
shifted
emphasis
from
the
grammatical
to
the
analytical.
Rather
than
focusing
on
mistakes
in
punctuation
(which
he
rightly
assumed
we
should
have
mastered),
his
red
pen
found
the
holes
in
our
thought
processes.
By
teaching
us
to
read
and
analyze
in
a
critical
way
he
was,
at
the
same
time,
helping
us
improve
our
writing
so
that
it
could
withstand
critical
analysis.
Additionally,
Mr.
Retman
emphasized
peer
editing
as
an
essential
ingredient
in
the
writing
process.
In
other
years,
I
did
not
appreciate
peer
editing
component;
too
often,
my
classmatesNeager
for
the
class-ending
bell
to
soundNrushed
through
the
exercise
leaving
me
with
a
Ngood
jobO
or
an
NitOs
perfectO
as
constructive
criticism.
Fortunately,
the
other
AP
English
students
were
committed
to
improvement
in
writing.
As
a
result,
their
observations
and
suggestions
were
often
thoughtful
and
productive.
As
I
have
learned
since
grammar
school,
transitions
are
important
in
writing.
However,
more
important
than
smooth
changes
from
one
paragraph
to
the
next
are
smooth
life
transitions.
Adjusting
to
college
was
the
biggest
transition
I
have
faced
thus
far
in
my
nineteen
years
of
life.
Not
only
did
my
professors
expect
more
of
me
as
a
writer,
but
I
began
to
expect
more
of
myself.
An
exercise
I
have
found
particularly
helpful
in
my
quest
to
become
a
better
writer
is
the
red
pencil
exercise.
After
developing
a
final
draft
of
a
paper,
I
print
it
and
sit
at
my
desk,
red
pencil
in
hand,
prepared
to
attack
my
own
writing
as
a
lion
would
attack
a
wounded
zebra.
I
demand
clarity
of
thought,
search
for
conciseness,
eliminate
redundancy
and
question
every
transition.
I
forage
for
mistakes
in
grammar
and
punctuation.
I
demand
clarity
of
thought.
In
effect,
this
critical
review
becomes
a
gameNthe
more
mistakes
I
find,
the
closer
I
am
to
winning.
I
also
concentrate
on
word
choice
and
word
combination
as
crucial
pieces
to
successful
writing.
This
does
not
mean
finding
long
words
to
test
the
proficiency
of
my
reader,
but
it
does
mean
using
words,
often
short,
that
are
interesting.
Unusual
word
and
even
letter
choice
can
enliven
a
writerOs
work.
Letters
create
impressions;
for
example,
the
letter
NvO
is
a
resonating
and
rich
letter.
Those
qualities
make
NvividO
a
better
choice
in
a
sentence
than
Ncolorful,O
a
word
with
similar
meaning
but
less
impact.
Similarly,
the
hard
NcO
and
NpO
which
begin
and
end
the
word
NcrispO
seem
to
fit
the
word
and
even
add
to
its
meaning.
The
poet
in
me
looks
for
letters
and
words
which
convey
the
impression
I
am
trying
to
make.
Some
letters
just
sound
better
than
others.
The
letter
NsO
is
not
particularly
interesting,
but
the
letter
NjO
is
unique
and
attention
grabbing.
NPOsO
are
strong
lettersNcreating
the
interesting
onomatopoeia
in
Npopped.O
In
addition
to
its
focus
on
critical
analysis,
these
and
other
subtleties
of
writing
also
separate
college
writing
from
the
writing
of
my
earlier
years.
As
I
enter
my
sophomore
year
of
college
and
reflect
upon
the
myriad
lessons
in
writing
that
have
shaped
my
style
and
skill
as
a
writer,
I
make
many
important
realizations.
Although
the
grades
received
on
writing
assignments
are
important
to
my
grade
point
average,
they
are
far
more
important
as
markers
of
my
progress
toward
excellent
writing.
I
am
more
excited
about
writing
now
than
ever.
I
understand
that
writing
can
inform,
persuade,
amuse,
sadden,
elate
or
otherwise
affect
my
readers,
sometimes
in
a
powerful
way.
The
better
I
write,
the
more
effectively
these
messages
can
be
communicated.
It
occurs
to
me
that
the
skill
of
writing
is
important
to
a
career,
personal
relationships,
and
life
in
general.
I
look
forward
to
passing
my
enthusiasm
to
others
as
a
Writing
Associate
this
year.
From
that
day
of
infamy
when
I
wrote
my
name
on
the
architectOs
expensive
chair,
to
the
day
I
entered
Lafayette
intending
to
major
in
English,
my
father
always
reminded
me
that
writing
was
difficult.
Contrary
to
common
belief,
he
warned
me,
good
writers
do
not
simply
sit
down
and
pound
out
brilliant
novels.
Rather,
writing
is
a
time
and
energy
consuming
process
which
takes
thoughtfulness,
practice
and
continual
hard
work.
Time
has
proven
his
words
true.
I
still
make
mistakes,
but
I
understand
that
writing
is
not
necessarily
easy,
even
for
the
most
experienced
authors.
Lesson
in
writing
number
one
hundred:
the
art
of
writing
is
a
lifelong
process.
