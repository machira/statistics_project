The
First
Annual
Reflection
of
My
College
Writing
My
academic
experiences
over
the
past
year
have
improved
both
mv
writing
and
my
ability
to
critique
the
writing
of
others.
While
all
new
writing
experiences,
even
unpleasant
ones,
provide
some
type
of
practical
benefit,
certain
experiences
help
develop
specific
skills
necessary
to
good
writing.
This
past
year
I
wrote
numerous
essays
for
my
various
classes
and
each
helped
me
in
one
way
or
another,
but
here
I
will
focus
on
a
few
specific
experiences
and
what
they
taught
me.
The
first
change
in
my
writing
skill
came
with
the
summer
reading
of
The
St.
Martin's
Handbook,
required
of
all
WAs.
Although
I
had
owned
The
St.
Martin's
Handbook
since
my
freshman
year,
I
had
never
really
read
the
grammar
section;
instead,
I
limited
its
use
to
checking
proper
forms
of
endnotes
and
bibliographies.
Because
I
was
required
to
familiarize
myself
with
The
St.
Martin's
Handbook,
I
learned
a
great
deal
of
rules
and
terms
of
grammar
that
I
had
never
realized
existed.
I
also
learned
the
importance
of
grammar:
how
as
WAs
we
do
not
stress
it
as
a
higher
order
concern,
yet,
at
the
same
time,
we
understand
the
necessity
of
grammar
in
effective
communication.
Reading
over
my
first
batch
of
student
papers
as
a
newly
certified
WA,
I
observed
several
recurring
problems
which
became
lessons
to
me
of
what
to
look
for
both
as
a
writer
and
as
a
WA..
The
first
thincr
to
catch
mv
attention
was
the
fact
that,
out
of
the
two-thirds
of
the
class
who
turned
their
papers
in
on
time,
one-half
of
the
papers
were
in
the
very
first
stages
of
development.
This
lack
of
completed
papers
(completed
in
the
sense
that
they
are
ready
to
be
read
by
a
WA,
not
a
final
draft)
can
be
attributed
almost
entirely
to
one
very
common
human
failing:
namely,
procrastination.
Some
of
the
students
at
least
had
the
decency
to
call
me
up
and
offer
some
type
of
lame
excuse;
others
just
pleaded
to
the
professor.
Procrastination
is
different
from
the
other
problems
that
I
dealt
with
as
a
WA
because
it
cannot
be
seen
directly
in
the
essays
(such
as
the
problem
of
no
thesis);
instead,
only
the
symptoms
can
be
seen:
poor
organization,
underdeveloped
ideas,
basic
grammatical
errors.
Because
I
myself
am
often
guilty
of
this
failing,
I
am
usually
sympathetic
to
the
students.
At
the
same
time,
however,
I
have
worked
out
several
techniques
that
help
to
force
students
to
take
their
first
drafts
and
their
WA
appointments
seriously.
Many
students
feel,
as
I
myself
felt,
that,
as
long
as
they
get
something
to
the
WA,
there
will
be
time
later
to
actually
produce
something
worthy
to
turn
into
the
professor
for
a
grade.
The
problem
with
this
thinking
is
that
it
completely
counters
the
help
that
a
WA
can
offer.
Very
few
students
care
about
becoming
better
writers
for
personal
improvement,
most
care
only
about
their
grades.
What
are
grades,
after
all,
but
a
reward/punishment-based
conditioning
tool.
Therefore,
the
way
to
make
students
respect
WAs
and
the
writing
process
is
to
convince
them
(whether
or
not
it
is
true)
that
their
grade
depends
on
full
cooperation
with
the
WA.
Specifically,
the
professor
may
decide
(as
mine
did
last
semester)
to
read
all
of
the
first
drafts
and
only
send
the
ones
that
he
or
she
feels
are
ready
to
be
read
by
the
WA,
returning
all
of
the
last
minute
garbage.
This
greatly
helped
the
students
and
I
to
establishing
productive
meetings.
The
professor
may
opt
to
inform
the
class
that
he
or
she
will
base
part
of
the
grade
on
the
quality
of
the
first
draft
and
participation
in
the
WA
meetings.
The
most
noticeable
problem
involved
the
common
misconception
of
students
that
quantity
was
all-important.
This
belief
manifested
itself
in
two
forms.
The
first
form
appeared
in
the
papers
themselves,
through
various
stretching"
techniques
such
as
overlarge
font,
overlarge
margins,
overabundance
of
quotes,
repetition
of
ideas,
etc.
The
best
(or
worst)
example
of
this
strict
adherence
to
quantity
is
the
technique
of
stuffing
a
paper
with
extra
words
and
sentences
in
an
effort
to
get
one
word
onto
the
next
page
in
order
to
meet
that
ever-crucial
page
number
requirement."
The
second
manifestation
appeared
in
the
questions
of
the
students
during
their
conferences:
Is
it
long
enough?
and
How
can
I
make
it
longer?
were,
by
far,
the
most
frequently
asked
questions.
In
all
honesty,
this
phenomenon
did
not
surprise
me
in
the
least.
In
fact,
I
have
been,
and
still
occasionally
am,
guilty
of
sacrificing
concision
and
coherence
to
the
altar
of
the
almighty
page
number.
I
believe
that
most
students
who
suffer
from
this
delusion
see
the
length
requirement
as
the
single
most
visible
and
measurable
sign
of
work
and
feel
that,
if
they
can
make
the
length,
then
they
have
given
a
decent
effort.
From
my
early
exposure
to
negative
criticism
(the
focus
of
my
first
writing
progress
reflection),
I
developed
a
philosophy
that,
if
I
could
meet
the
length
requirement
and
answer
the
question
being
asked,
then
I
might
stand
a
decent
chance
of
not
failing.
This
may
seem
pessimistic
and
self
defeating,
but
my
experiences
have
revealed
that
the
setting
of
low
expectations
is
the
surest
way
of
guaranteeing
positive
results.
Perhaps
the
lesson
that
I
took
the
most
to
heart
while
WAing
is
the
necessity
of
answering
the
question
or
questions
being
asked.
After
reading
paper
after
paper,
it
became
obvious
to
me
that
many
students
had
not
addressed
the
required
topic.
While
some
of
these
papers
were
well
written,
they
usually
received
lower
grades

(both
in
writing
and
later
rereading)
of
keeping
a
diary
during
one
summer
trip
gave
me
a
great
deal
of
enjoyment.
Second,
by
allowing
us
to
choose
our
form
of
response,
the
professor
encouraged
our
creativity.
I
tried
my
hand
at
satire
several
times;
I
even
wrote
a
few
poems
(perhaps
for
the
first
time
voluntarily).
During
the
spring
semester
of
this
year,
I
worked
as
the
assistant
to
the
editors
of
The
Shakespeare
Bulletin,
a
scholarly
magazine
published
here
on
campus.
My
job
duties
included
typing
revisions
of
articles
as
the
editors
revised
draft
after
draft.
This
work
strongly
imbedded
into
me
the
importance
of
multiple
revision
in
the
writing
process.
Over
time,
I
also
began
to
see
how
often
ideas
can
be
expressed
more
concisely
with
the
proper
choice
of
words.
More
often
than
not,
being
able
to
convey
an
idea
in
less
words
keeps
the
paper
focused.
Currently,
I
am
researching
material
in
an
effort
to
formulate
a
topic
for
my
honors
thesis.
Having
already
given
a
general,
tentative
topic
this
past
spring,
I
now
must
focus
on
a
specific
aspect
of
my
subject
to
pursue.
The
research
has
been
an
educational
experience
in
and
of
itself.
Research
is,
after
all,
an
important
step
in
the
writing
process.
The
selection
of
a
definitive
topic
has
proven
a
new
and
unusually
difficult
challenge.
Because
I
am
used
to
writing
much
shorter
papers,
I
am
having
trouble
selecting
a
topic
focused
enough
for
a
definitive
argument
but
rich
enough
to
sustain
over
a
longer
work*
I
look
forward
to
gaining
the
skills
and
knowledge
that
this
experience
is
sure
to
provide.
