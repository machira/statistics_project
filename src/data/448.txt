Writing
as
a
WA
Last
summer,
I
sat
down
to
reflect
on
my
lifetime
history
as
a
writer.
As
I
began
to
list
every
momentous
occasion
in
my
development
as
a
writer,
from
learning
the
alphabet
to
mastering
parallel
structure,
it
became
clear
that
I
would
have
plenty
to
write
about.
Seven
pages
didnOt
seem
like
enough
space
to
tell
the
entire
story
of
my
writing
history.
Now,
this
summer,
I
must
elaborate
on
my
writing
over
just
the
past
year
in
the
same
space
allotment,
and
to
be
quite
honest,
the
task
seems
rather
daunting.
IOm
not
even
sure
my
writing
has
changed
significantly
over
the
past
year.
IOve
written
the
same
type
of
papers
that
IOve
been
writing
throughout
high
school
and
college,
on
the
same
subject
matter,
and
with
the
same
style.
So
how
could
my
writing
have
changed
that
much?
The
main
difference
in
my
writing
this
year
is
that
I
have
been
writing
as
a
Writing
Associate.
My
development
as
a
writer
this
year,
however
subtle,
has
undoubtedly
been
influenced,
if
not
directly
caused
by,
my
position
as
a
WA.
I
began
my
year
of
WA-ing
like
everyone
else:
at
the
WA
workshop.
There,
I
learned
helpful
tips
on
how
to
stay
organized,
communicate
effectively
with
professors,
break
the
ice
with
students,
and
deal
with
more
difficult
conferences.
I
found
our
discussion
of
the
summer
readings
to
be
even
more
helpful,
though.
One
theme
of
the
workshop
seemed
to
be
that
there
is
not
a
NrightO
or
NwrongO
way
to
write.
Having
grown
up
in
a
school
district
that
engrained
the
strict
rules
of
grammar
and
style
into
my
head,
this
was
a
novel,
and
almost
radical
idea.
I
wanted
to
find
every
teacher
who
had
ever
berated
my
writing
and
make
them
read
Representing
the
NOtherO
so
that
they
could
see
that
they
had
no
right
to
tell
me
I
was
wrong.
Writing
styles
canOt
be
wrong;
they
can
only
be
different.
With
my
new
open
minded
attitude,
I
met
with
the
class
I
had
been
assigned
for
the
semester.
It
was
an
FYS
entitled
NQuestions
in
Science,O
taught
by
a
physics
instructor.
After
getting
my
first
batch
of
papers,
I
realized
that
the
students
came
from
a
variety
of
writing
backgrounds.
The
FYS
program
seems
to
be
an
attempt
to
get
all
freshmen
students
on
a
level
playing
field
for
the
remainder
of
their
college
careers.
It
reviews
the
basics
of
critical
reading
and
writing
for
all
students,
whether
they
came
from
public
or
private
schools,
honors
or
standard
English
classes,
or
had
high
or
low
SAT
scores,
so
that
everyone
at
Lafayette
is
familiar
with
the
same
academic
discourse.
While
this
is
a
necessary
transition
into
college,
it
made
my
job
as
a
WA
somewhat
difficult,
although
very
interesting.
I
was
amazed
at
the
fact
that
one
paper
I
read
could
be
beautifully
crafted
and
well
organized,
while
the
very
next
one
in
the
pile
was
barely
intelligible.
Even
if
there
was
no
such
thing
as
right
and
wrong
writing,
differences
were
very
apparent.
Along
with
the
first
round
of
papers,
I
collected
the
questionnaire
that
I
had
given
students
asking
them
about
their
strengths,
weaknesses,
and
goals
as
writers.
Most
students
were
very
aware
of
themselves
as
writers.
They
pointed
out
areas
of
strength
and
weakness
that
I,
too,
had
noted
in
reading
their
papers.
These
questionnaires
were
extremely
helpful
because
they
gave
me
a
sense
of
what
each
writer
expected
to
get
out
of
their
WA
conferences.
I
looked
forward
to
meeting
students
who
wrote
that
they
expected
a
lot
out
of
me,
because
I
suspected
that
they
would
be
very
engaged
during
our
meetings.
Other
students
wrote
that
they
just
wanted
me
to
check
their
grammar.
I
knew
IOd
have
to
elaborate
on
the
role
of
a
WA
with
them
when
conferences
began
to
dispel
this
misconception.
Once
I
had
read
all
the
papers
and
questionnaires,
conferences
began.
Talking
with
students
about
their
writing
revealed
so
much
more
than
just
reading
it.
Just
as
the
style
and
ability
of
the
writing
I
had
seen
varied
across
the
class,
so
did
their
attitudes
towards
the
WA
conferences.
For
the
most
part,
students
were
very
attentive
and
engaged
in
our
meetings.
A
few
seemed
like
they
couldnOt
wait
for
the
conference
to
be
over.
Some
of
these
apathetic
students
were
excellent
writers
who
probably
thought
their
papers
didnOt
need
improving,
while
others
should
have
been
thankful
for
every
moment
they
had
to
talk
about
their
papers,
because
there
was
plenty
to
talk
about.
This
was
definitely
the
most
challenging
part
of
my
job.
I
found
it
very
difficult
to
conduct
productive
conferences
when
a
student
clearly
had
no
interest
in
being
there.
Although
I
tried
to
ask
open-ended
questions
to
force
students
to
talk,
some
of
them
had
an
amazing
ability
to
answer
these
questions
with
just
one
word.
Despite
the
difficulties
I
faced
in
trying
to
get
students
to
participate
more
actively
in
conferences,
I
found
that
when
I
did
get
through
to
students,
it
was
extremely
rewarding.
Most
of
the
assignments
for
the
class
asked
students
to
compare
how
scientific
concepts
were
portrayed
by
different
types
of
publications.
A
few
of
the
students
had
a
lot
of
trouble
writing
a
paper
on
this
subject.
Rather
than
explaining
how
different
journals
and
magazines
described
a
scientific
phenomenon,
their
papers
simply
explained
what
the
phenomenon
was,
with
no
critical
analysis
of
the
sources.
These
students
were
clearly
more
comfortable
writing
an
explanatory
essay
than
a
literature
critique.
At
our
conferences,
I
asked
them
questions
about
the
sources
themselves,
including
details
about
the
title,
the
language,
and
even
the
use
of
graphics.
With
each
assignment,
they
began
to
understand
the
goal
of
the
paper
more
clearly,
and
by
the
end
of
the
semester,
they
were
able
to
write
about
salient
features
of
different
articles
and
explain
how
they
were
written
for
different
audiences.
I
felt
like
I
had
helped
those
students
critique
literature
and
begin
to
master
a
whole
new
writing
discipline,
which
was
very
rewarding.
Second
semester
brought
new
challenges
to
my
job
as
a
WA.
I
was
assigned
to
a
VAST
entitled
NComputers
and
Society,O
which
is
a
required
class
for
all
computer
science
majors.
I
was
slightly
intimidated
by
this
because
I
know
very
little
about
computers,
but
I
knew
the
WA
program
was
designed
so
that
I
wouldnOt
have
to
know
the
subject
matter
of
the
course,
and
so
I
trusted
that.
As
it
turned
out,
the
paper
assignments
dealt
with
broad
issues
of
privacy
on
the
internet,
artificial
intelligence,
and
technology
legislation
rather
than
the
technical
details
of
computers.
I
learned
a
lot
from
reading
the
papers,
and
they
were
surprisingly
interesting.
The
biggest
challenge
in
my
WA
conferences
for
this
class
was
that
many
of
the
class
members
were
ESL
students,
which
I
hadnOt
experienced
the
previous
semester.
I
felt
that
my
typical
WA
conferences
focused
on
higher
order
concerns;
I
had
gotten
accustomed
to
developing
strong
theses
during
conferences
and
outlining
papers
with
students
to
help
with
their
organization.
The
ESL
students
required
me
to
shift
my
focus
to
what
would
normally
be
considered
lower
order
concerns.
The
professor
found
surface
errors
so
distracting
that
she
would
refuse
to
grade
a
paper
with
too
many
of
them,
which
was
a
problem
for
ESL
students
who
hadnOt
yet
mastered
the
mechanics
of
English.
Some
of
our
conferences
were
spent
talking
about
many
of
the
general
grammatical
rules
of
English,
using
the
paper
merely
as
a
source
of
examples.
It
was
challenging
to
explain
why
certain
sentences
needed
to
be
reworded,
but
I
felt
I
couldnOt
just
tell
the
students
that
Nit
just
sounded
weirdO
the
way
it
was
written.
Besides,
I
again
remembered
Representing
the
NOtherO
and
knew
I
couldnOt
tell
students
that
they
were
simply
wrong.
Still,
knowing
their
professorOs
policy
on
grammatical
errors,
I
knew
I
had
to
point
out
and
explain
their
unconventional
uses
of
English.
The
St.
MartinOs
Handbook
proved
to
be
very
useful
for
this
task,
since
it
was
able
to
explain
why
certain
things
were
wrong
when
I
could
sometimes
only
recognize
that
they
were
wrong.
My
two
semesters
as
a
WA
certainly
influenced
my
writing
this
year.
Since
I
served
as
an
audience
for
so
many
different
writers,
it
became
easier
for
me
to
write
for
a
specific
audience
in
my
papers.
I
knew
what
worked
well
in
papers
I
had
read,
and
what
made
them
difficult
to
understand.
Even
though
I
didnOt
meet
with
WAOs
for
any
of
my
classes
this
year,
I
considered
my
own
WA
experiences
as
I
was
writing.
In
a
way,
I
acted
as
my
own
WA,
carrying
out
the
dialogue
of
a
conference
within
my
own
head.
The
attitudes
of
many
of
my
WA
students
also
inspired
my
writing
this
year.
Most
of
the
students
I
met
with
this
year
were
science
majors,
and
many
of
them
made
this
clear
in
our
first
meeting.
Many
science
majors
use
their
preferred
field
as
a
disclaimer
for
their
writing
abilities.
As
a
neuroscience
major,
IOve
heard
it
from
may
of
my
classmates,
and
I
also
heard
it
from
many
of
my
WA
students.
NIOm
not
a
writer.
IOm
a
scientist.O
I
explained
to
many
of
my
students
that
these
two
roles
are
not
mutually
exclusive.
In
any
field,
being
a
good
writer
is
a
major
asset.
It
was
sometimes
difficult
to
convince
these
science
majors
of
this,
but
once
I
did,
they
were
more
attentive
and
engaged
in
conferences.
The
initial
apathy
towards
writing
that
many
of
my
WA
students
and
fellow
science
majors
demonstrated
inspired
me
to
continue
to
improve
my
writing.
As
a
science
major
at
Lafayette,
my
course
requirements
steer
me
away
from
the
humanities.
Having
tested
out
of
College
Writing,
I
could
have
completed
my
education
at
a
liberal
arts
college
without
ever
taking
an
English
course.
In
order
to
have
a
more
balanced
education,
I
decided
my
freshman
year
that
I
would
pursue
an
English
minor.
Unfortunately,
as
my
neuroscience
course
load
became
more
demanding
in
my
junior
year,
I
was
not
able
to
fit
in
an
English
course
both
semesters.
I
really
missed
having
a
class
in
which
writing
was
the
primary
focus,
rather
than
just
a
means
to
convey
scientific
ideas.
I
filled
this
literary
void
in
a
few
ways.
Becoming
a
WA
in
itself
was
one
way
I
sought
to
keep
in
touch
with
writing.
Reading
papers
and
discussing
the
writing
techniques
they
employed
was
a
great
way
for
me
to
continue
my
development
as
a
writer,
even
when
I
wasnOt
taking
any
English
courses.
While
practicing
writing
is
probably
the
best
way
to
improve
writing
skills,
reading
and
discussion
is
probably
the
next
best
thing.
Besides,
in
most
classes,
even
English
classes,
we
donOt
talk
about
writing;
weOre
just
expected
to
do
it.
Being
a
WA
gives
me
another
way
to
improve
my
own
writing
by
absorbing
other
peopleOs
ideas
and
approaches
to
the
craft.
Just
talking
about
writing
isnOt
enough
to
improve
it,
though.
Even
though
I
wasnOt
taking
any
English
courses,
there
was
always
writing
to
do
as
part
of
my
neuroscience
curriculum.
Throughout
the
year,
I
tried
to
improve
my
scientific
writing
and
incorporate
my
own
style
even
into
lab
reports
and
scientific
literature
reviews.
Writing
for
the
discipline
of
Psychology
must
adhere
to
very
strict
organizational
and
stylistic
guidelines.
The
APA
journal
that
guides
neuroscience
majors
through
every
lab
report
is
filled
with
instructions
for
every
portion
of
the
report,
from
the
number
of
spaces
between
the
words
of
the
header
to
the
way
tables
and
figures
should
be
italicized
and
capitalized.
With
such
stringent
requirements,
it
is
difficult
to
express
oneself
in
a
lab
report,
but
of
course
I
tried.
Through
amusing
titles,
anecdotal
introductions,
and
creative
discussion
sections,
I
subtly
infused
style
into
my
manuscripts.
Professors
have
commented
that
my
lab
reports
are
almost
enjoyable
to
read,
which
is
extremely
flattering.
As
I
continue
my
work
in
the
field
and
eventually
publish
my
findings,
I
hope
that
other
scientists
will
also
appreciate
my
writing,
as
well
as
the
science
that
it
describes.
Another
way
for
me
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
humanities
was
to
expand
my
nonacademic
writing.
IOve
always
written
poetry
and
short
stories,
primarily
for
myself,
but
this
year
I
began
submitting
them
to
various
publications.
I
also
began
writing
a
few
articles
for
Marooned,
which
has
not
only
helped
me
expand
my
writing
genres,
but
has
served
as
an
excellent
way
to
vent
about
issues
at
Lafayette.
I
hope
to
continue
this
writing
next
year.
As
I
look
towards
my
senior
year,
I
expect
my
writing
to
continue
to
develop.
This
year,
IOll
be
able
to
take
a
few
more
English
courses
that
IOm
really
looking
forward
to.
I
will
also
be
conducting
an
honors
thesis
in
neuroscience,
which
will
entail
a
lot
of
scientific
writing.
I
plan
to
use
the
skills
that
IOve
learned
over
the
years
and
honed
this
past
year
as
a
WA
to
complete
most
of
this
independent
writing.
Perhaps
IOll
even
start
coming
to
drop-in
hours
and
let
a
fellow
WA
suffer
through
a
few
pages
about
fear
and
the
rat
prefrontal
cortex.
I
look
forward
to
meeting
with
my
new
WA
class
so
that
I
can
help
them
transition
into
college
writing
and
again
learn
about
writing
strategies
from
them.
