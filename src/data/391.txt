My
history
as
a
writer
really
didnOt
begin
until
I
was
around
ten
years
old.
The
reason
for
this
was
that
I
didnOt
learn
to
read
until
I
was
nearly
eight.
When
I
was
five
it
became
obvious
that
I
was
having
difficulty
with
reading.
I
simply
couldnOt
figure
out
how
the
letters
where
supposed
to
sound
when
they
were
all
mixed
up
in
words.
OHooked
on
PhonicsO
didnOt
exist
back
then,
and
my
mother
didnOt
want
me
to
be
labeled
mentally
retarded
or
be
held
back
in
first
grade
indefinitely,
so
she
decided
to
homeschool
me.
My
mom
tried
many
different
methods
for
teaching
phonics,
and
I
can
still
remember
learning
that
Owhen
two
vowels
go
out
to
play
together,
the
first
vowel
makes
its
looong
sound
and
the
second
one
is
silent.O
It
was
definitely
an
uphill
climb.
However,
my
mom
is
a
smart
woman
and
she
figured
that
even
if
I
couldnOt
learn
to
read,
I
could
still
learn
to
love
reading.
So
she
made
it
a
priority
to
read
aloud
to
my
older
brother
and
I
every
day.
Mostly,
she
read
short
stories
like
Beverly
Cleary,
but
as
I
got
older
she
added
some
classics
like
The
Hobbit
and
Treasure
Island.
But
even
though
I
loved
hearing
stories,
I
couldnOt
manage
to
read
them
myself.
Then,
when
I
was
seven,
I
finally
managed
to
get
through
Dr.
Seuss.
Once
I
mastered
simple
sentence
structures
and
basic
phonics,
reading
wasnOt
so
scary
anymore,
and
I
moved
on
to
books
like
The
Berenstain
Bears
and
Amelia
Bedelia.
After
that
my
brain
caught
on
quickly,
and
I
joined
the
rest
of
my
age
group
in
reading
The
Baby-SittersO
Club,
Nancy
Drew,
and
the
American
Girls
series.
The
love
of
reading
that
my
mother
had
tried
so
hard
to
instill
in
all
of
her
children
now
came
to
fruition,
and
trips
to
the
library
were
frequent.
Often
we
came
home
with
armloads
of
books,
which
inevitably
resulted
in
many
grudgingly
paid
library
fines
for
books
that
I
lost
or
misplaced.
Thus,
before
I
entered
high
school
I
had
savored
enough
classics,
such
as
Robin
Hood,
The
Prince
and
the
Pauper,
Ivanhoe,
and
The
Count
of
Monte
Cristo,
to
feel
fairly
confident
of
my
literary
background.
My
writing
background,
however,
was
a
different
story.
My
writing
program
up
up
until
eighth
grade
consisted
mostly
of
my
writing
short
descriptive
paragraphs.
It
went
hand
in
hand
with
my
literature
program,
which
had
me
interpreting
and
analyzing
selections
from
all
of
the
major
genres.
When
I
entered
the
eighth
grade,
my
Mom
decided
I
needed
to
practice
more
creative
writing.
While
I
loved
reading,
I
hated
writing,
but
creative
writing
was
new
to
me.
I
did
enjoy
the
assignments,
once
I
got
into
them.
For
the
first
time,
I
actually
felt
like
my
writing
sounded
really
good.
Looking
back,
I
can
see
that
this
course
taught
me
how
to
use
specific
adjectives,
adverbs
and
nouns
to
make
my
writing
more
powerful.
I
became
more
adept
at
expressing
myself
on
paper;
however,
I
still
disliked
having
to
write
at
all.
When
I
entered
high
school,
I
was
a
confirmed
English
hater.
For
me,
the
world
was
divided
into
two
groups
-
people
who
were
good
at
math
and
science
and
people
who
were
good
at
English.
Therefore,
since
I
liked
science,
I
could
not
possibly
be
good
at
writing;
English
homework
was
bumped
to
the
bottom
of
my
Oto
doO
list.
Then
something
happened
that
gradually
transformed
my
attitude
toward
writing.
I
was
part
of
a
social
circle
that
competed
for
the
top
grades
in
science
and
math.
It
was
friendly
competition
and
I
admired
the
students
who
placed
value
on
academic
achievement
instead
of
more
superficial
things.
One
day,
as
I
sat
down
in
the
biology
classroom
where
we
all
met
for
lunch,
I
was
surprised
to
find
that
our
upcoming
grammar
test
was
the
topic
of
conversation.
To
my
amazement,
one
girl
laughed
and
said
that
she
was
a
Ogrammar
queenO
and
that
determined
to
ace
any
exam
our
teacher
threw
at
us.
That
a
student
who
was
great
at
science
would
also
seek
to
be
great
at
English
was
a
novel
idea
to
me.
And
in
grammar,
too!
The
subject
that
all
students
traditionally
hate!
I
gave
this
new
idea
a
lot
of
thought,
and
gradually
my
attitude
toward
writing
began
to
change.
I
certainly
put
a
lot
more
effort
into
my
writing
assignments
after
that.
In
addition,
things
my
English
teacher
said
began
to
hit
home.
He
pointed
out
that
even
scientists
needed
writing
skills
if
they
wanted
publish
their
research.
He
stressed
that
writing
was
a
skill
that
took
a
lifetime
to
perfect,
and
told
us
not
to
be
discouraged
when
we
found
things
that
we
needed
to
change,
because
even
great
writers
need
to
constantly
revise
their
work.
So
I
entered
my
sophomore
year
of
high
school
with
a
new
approach
toward
writing.
In
our
second
year
English
class
we
were
supposed
to
practice
all
the
different
writing
styles,
but
in
reality
we
only
wrote
one
paper
the
whole
year.
We
were
supposed
to
read
a
British
novel
and
analyze
how
the
story
and
its
characters
were
affected
by
the
authorOs
cultural
views.
I
wrote
my
paper
on
Ivanhoe
and
Sir
Walter
Scott,
and
I
put
it
off
until
two
days
before
it
was
due
(this
became
an
undying
ritual
for
throughout
the
rest
of
my
high
school
career).
When
I
got
the
paper
back
I
found
that
I
had
earned
an
OAO
but
my
teacher
had
scrawled
on
the
back
NExcellent
organization,
but
content
was
mostly
fluff.O
At
first
I
was
rather
hurt
by
this
sweeping
judgment
(at
this
stage
of
my
writing
career
I
was
still
apt
to
take
criticism
personally).
After
all,
I
had
seriously
researched
the
paper,
even
if
I
had
written
it
at
the
last
minute.
But,
when
I
thought
back
on
it
later,
I
could
see
what
she
meant.
I
liked
Sir
Walter
Scott
as
an
author,
but
in
my
paper
I
had
painted
him
out
to
be
some
kind
of
champion
for
the
lower
class,
which
simply
wasnOt
true.
Sir
Walter
Scott
did
sympathize
with
the
lower
class,
but
my
thesis
was
entirely
too
extreme.
Apparently,
there
was
more
to
writing
than
just
sounding
really
smart.
I
had
learned
to
express
myself
fairly
well,
but
I
had
yet
to
master
the
real
skill
of
writing
-
the
critical
thinking
that
leads
to
a
solid
thesis.
There
was
another
course
besides
English
that
contributed
to
my
writing
ability
in
ways
I
never
imagined
it
could.
In
my
sophomore
year
I
began
my
three-year
foray
into
Latin.
Even
though
I
had
warmed
to
writing,
grammar
and
I
still
had
a
cold
relationship.
I
was
intimidated
by
grammar;
as
a
subject
I
felt
that
it
was
tedious
and
cumbersome
and
entirely
useless.
Sure,
I
could
memorize
the
difference
between
a
relative
pronoun
and
an
interrogative
pronoun,
but
did
it
really
matter?
It
wasnOt
until
I
started
Latin
that
I
found
a
use
for
grammar.
Latin
is
both
completely
structured
and
completely
fluid
-
you
can
write
the
words
in
any
order
you
want,
but
they
all
have
different
endings
depending
on
what
part
of
speech
they
are.
Unlike
English,
Latin
always
obeys
its
own
rules,
so
the
grammar
is
really
easy
to
pick
up.
Everything
that
never
made
sense
about
parts
of
speech
in
English
class
suddenly
made
perfect
sense
in
Latin
class.
My
sudden
comprehension
of
a
subject
that
had
seemed
so
intangible
and
nebulous
worked
wonders
on
my
confidence
as
a
writer.
Maybe
all
this
writing
stuff
wasnOt
so
difficult
after
all.
My
writing
grew
steadily
better
throughout
my
junior
year.
In
my
English
class,
American
literature,
we
tackled
Nathaniel
HawthorneOs
The
Scarlet
Letter,
Of
Mice
and
Men,
and
Their
Eyes
Were
Watching
God.
Our
in-class
discussions
were
lively,
with
our
teacher
always
prompting
us
to
back
up
our
opinions
with
specific
references
to
the
text.
She
told
us
that
interpreting
the
text
correctly
was
only
half
the
picture;
even
if
we
had
a
really
good
thesis,
it
wasnOt
worth
anything
unless
we
could
back
it
up
with
examples.
Over
and
over
she
reminded
us
that
we
needed
to
clearly
state
how
our
examples
backed
up
our
conclusions.
The
same
lesson
was
drilled
into
us
in
our
American
history
class.
NShow
me,
donOt
tell
meO
was
the
motto
that
we
heard
throughout
the
year.
At
my
high
school,
every
junior
writes
a
twenty-page
history
paper,
which
counts
for
a
third
of
his
grade
in
both
American
History
and
American
Literature
classes.
Not
surprisingly,
a
lot
of
time
was
devoted
to
teaching
proper
methods
of
research
and
documentation.
I
spent
many
hours
going
through
primary
and
secondary
sources,
and
many
more
hours
writing
my
paper.
The
first
draft
was
due
in
February,
and
it
was
then
that
I
had
my
first
experience
with
peer
editing.
It
was
a
bad
experience.
As
peer
editors,
we
received
a
five-page
checklist
of
spelling,
grammar,
and
MLA
format
that
we
had
to
fill
out
for
each
paper,
right
down
to
whether
the
tab
was
correctly
set
at
half
an
inch.
To
say
that
it
was
enormously
tedious
would
be
an
understatement
-
we
had
to
check
for
font
type,
font
size,
margin
width,
and
correct
MLA
format
for
parenthetical
citation,
works
cited,
and
references.
In
addition,
we
were
expected
to
correct
all
grammar
and
spelling
mistakes,
as
well
as
comment
on
the
writing
itself.
We
then
had
to
assign
a
Npeer
ratingO
from
one
to
ten.
And
since
our
teachers
didnOt
want
sloppy
peer
editing,
we
got
a
point
off
our
own
grade
for
any
mistakes
we
made.
Neither
the
English
nor
the
history
teachers
actually
read
any
of
the
rough
drafts.
I
was
dismayed
that
so
much
emphasis
was
placed
on
the
appearance
of
the
paper
instead
of
the
content;
did
it
matter
what
the
paper
looked
like
as
long
as
the
arguments
were
sound?
I
think
that
my
critical
reasoning
skills
improved
during
my
junior
year,
but
I
know
I
felt
frustrated
by
the
complete
lack
of
feedback
from
my
teachers.
My
experience
in
AP
English
was
hardly
better.
This
was
disappointing,
because
I
had
been
looking
forward
to
taking
this
class.
Even
though
I
liked
the
material
we
covered
and
the
students
were
all
intelligent
and
articulate,
I
came
to
loathe
the
minutes
I
spent
in
that
classroom.
On
the
very
first
day
of
school
our
teacher
greeted
us
with
a
twenty-question
test
on
the
assigned
summer
reading
-
and
it
was
a
hard
test,
too.
I
figured
that
she
was
just
trying
to
make
it
clear,
like
all
the
other
AP
teachers,
that
we
would
be
expected
to
consistently
work
harder
and
faster
than
in
our
regular
courses.
This
was
a
strategy
often
employed
by
teachers
to
weed
out
any
borderline
students
who
might
not
be
up
to
scratch.
Two
days
later
she
stalked
into
the
classroom
and
proceeded
to
tell
us
that
she
had
never
had
a
class
that
was
worse
at
analyzing
literature
than
we
were,
and
that
if
we
were
the
cream
of
the
crop
in
English,
then
our
previous
instructors
clearly
were
not
doing
their
job.
This
caught
us
all
rather
off
guard.
(It
seemed
to
me
that,
since
she
was
the
dean
of
the
English
department,
if
she
was
unhappy
with
the
curriculum,
she
had
no
one
to
blame
but
herself.)
We
figured
that
she
would
loosen
up
a
bit
after
the
first
week,
especially
after
7
out
of
23
students
dropped
-
a
high
mortality
rate,
even
for
an
AP
course.
But
our
hopes
proved
futile.
The
weeks
that
followed
saw
the
love
of
literature
slowly
squeezed
out
of
us
all.
We
read
passages
and
short
stories
at
home,
and
then
discussed
them
in
class.
Or
failed
to
discuss
them,
as
the
case
was.
Students,
myself
included,
offered
many
explanations,
ideas,
and
insights
only
to
have
them
shot
down
at
once.
It
soon
became
clear
why
-
there
was
no
correct
interpretation
except
for
hers.
Whenever
someone
spoke,
our
teacher
pointed
out
a
half
or
dozen
or
so
reasons
why
the
interpretation
was
incorrect,
insufficient,
inadequate,
or
simply
ridiculous.
Often
she
would
take
the
opportunity
to
expound
on
the
failings
of
the
class
in
general,
either
in
a
severe
tone
with
which
she
prophesied
low
scores
for
us
all,
or
in
a
smiling
almost-
laughing
chuckle
as
if
our
struggles
were
humorous
and
we
were
performing
badly
for
our
own
entertainment.
The
atmosphere
was
entirely
different
from
our
earlier
English
classes.
All
students
-
even
students
who
know
that
they
are
very
bright
-
have
a
natural
fear
of
being
laughed
at
in
class.
Every
insight
into
a
story
has
a
personal
element
in
it,
so
to
offer
an
opinion
aloud
is
to
offer
a
little
of
your
soul,
too.
Most
students,
myself
included,
became
completely
discouraged
after
the
first
two
weeks
and
simply
stopped
answering
any
questions
at
all.
This
led
to
many
awkward
pauses
during
class
discussions,
so
we
started
doing
more
writing
and
less
talking.
Writing
a
well-thought-out
essay
in
a
forty-five
minute
class
was
difficult
for
me,
because
I
tend
to
write
very
slowly.
I
like
to
do
all
of
my
thinking
first,
rehearse
what
I
want
to
say
in
my
head,
and
then
write
it
all
down
on
paper.
I
disliked
writing
under
pressure
(I
still
do),
but
it
was
necessary
and
it
did
give
me
much
needed
practice.
My
analytical
and
critical
thinking
skills
improved
considerably
in
this
course,
even
though
I
disliked
the
course
in
general.
But,
I
think
that
the
most
valuable
skill
I
gained
from
this
experience
was
the
ability
to
be
my
own
worst
critic.
I
could
now
look
at
my
work
impartially
and
evaluate
the
strengths
of
my
thesis
and
my
examples.
I
learned
to
ask
the
questions
that
so
often
come
up
in
revising
a
paper:
did
I
clearly
state
what
I
was
trying
to
prove?
Do
all
my
examples
really
support
my
thesis?
Did
this
paragraph
have
a
main
point?
Did
I
stay
on
topic?
Did
I
include
unnecessary
information
unrelated
to
my
thesis?
I
had
come
a
long
way
from
where
I
had
been
in
my
sophomore
year:
unable
to
tell
whether
my
writing
was
good
or
bad!
Did
I
feel
adequately
prepared
for
college
writing?
I
felt
nervous
about
college
in
general;
I
had
no
idea
what
any
of
the
classes
would
be
like.
I
was
apprehensive
about
a
college
writing
course
-
all
I
knew
was
that
everyone
said
that
it
would
be
very
different
from
writing
in
high
school
high
school.
As
it
happened,
I
found
it
very
easy
to
transition
to
a
college
writing
environment.
Looking
back,
I
think
that
this
was
not
because
I
was
especially
good
at
writing,
but
because
I
had
developed
the
right
attitude
toward
writing.
Writing
can
be
very
intimidating
-
I
know
I
was
very
intimidated
by
writing
when
I
began
high
school
-
and
it
took
a
long
time
for
me
to
stop
thinking
of
a
paper
as
scary,
overwhelming
project.
Now
that
IOve
stopped
seeing
the
keyboard
as
a
boxing
ring,
writing
is
a
lot
less
stressful
and
a
lot
more
enjoyable.
