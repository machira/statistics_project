Grasping
at
an
Idea
The
first
thing
I
can
clearly
remember
writing
was
a
short
childrenOs
book
that
I
penned
in
Kindergarten.
The
book,
accompanied
by
illustrations
lushly
rendered
in
crayon,
told
the
story
of
an
unhappy
robot
who
lived
in
a
junkyard.
It
was,
fittingly
enough,
titled
NThe
Unhappy
Robot.O
Eventually,
the
unhappy
robot
pulls
himself
together
and
uses
scraps
from
the
junkyard
to
build
a
fantastic
rainbow-making
machine.
Looking
back
on
it
now,
I
am
struck
by
how
many
of
my
ideas
from
so
long
ago
still
resonate
with
me.
At
the
very
least,
the
plot
seems
eerily
similar
to
the
plot
of
WALL-E,
so
I
feel
I
must
have
tapped
into
at
least
somewhat
interesting
themes.
The
idea
of
taking
trash
and
turning
it
into
something
beautiful,
or
at
least
interesting,
still
compels
me,
and
drives
much
of
my
writing
method.
I
recall
sitting
at
the
kitchen
table
and
reciting
the
story,
carefully
mimicking
the
tone
and
language
of
the
picture
books
my
parents
read
to
me
each
night,
while
my
mom
recorded
each
of
my
words.
The
penmanship
and
spelling
was,
of
course,
hers,
and
much
better
they
would
have
been
if
I
was
writing
on
my
own,
but
those
words
were
all
mine.
It
felt
good
to
tell
that
story,
and
I
was
happy
to
be
putting
my
feelings
and
experiencesNand
my
love
of
junkNto
paper.
I
wanted
to
share
these
ideas
with
people,
to
make
them
see
the
beauty
even
in
these
broken
things.
This
is
the
part
where
traditionally,
in
the
essays
I
have
read,
the
author
describes
their
first
great
discovery
in
the
medium
of
text,
and
its
impact
upon
them
as
writers.
However,
I
feel
like
this
first
brush
with
writing
is
significant
to
me
for
a
completely
different
reason.
Looking
back
on
it
now,
I
do
not
feel
that
I
discovered
some
hidden
ability
to
create.
I
do
not
think
I
ever
doubted
my
own
abilities.
I
remember
being
happy,
and
I
remember
being
serious,
but
I
do
not
remember
being
surprised.
If
other
people
could
tell
stories,
of
course
I
could
as
well!
And,
after
all,
I
was
not
particularly
concerned
with
the
creative
process,
or
whether
or
not
people
would
like
my
bookNI
had
an
idea,
and
it
wanted
to
be
heard!
Occasionally
I
have
had
to
rediscover
this
confidence,
and
there
are
plenty
of
times
when
that
confidence
has
left
me,
either
due
to
my
own
inner
fears,
or
due
to
others
not
responding
to
my
work
the
way
I
had
hoped.
But
this
thought
of
the
Idea
as
the
ultimate
fundamental
particle
of
my
writing,
the
hot
core
spinning
away
beneath
the
dross,
appears
in
every
single
one
of
my
major
writing
experiences.
My
next
memory
of
writing
is
set
in
the
third
gradeNa
recollection
of
reading
to
my
classmates
from
a
half-finished
story.
I
scribbled
the
text
out
on
notebook
paper
as
part
of
a
carefully
planned
longer
saga,
slogging
through
the
irritation
of
punctuation
and
spelling
to
grasp
at
the
titanic
events
I
wanted
to
relate.
I
suspect
that
the
long
shelves
at
the
library
full
of
Tom
Swift,
Hardy
Boys,
and
Nancy
Drew
books
inspired
me
to
think
that
all
stories
were
part
of
a
much
more
expansive
setting.
That,
and
the
fact
that
my
father
read
Lord
of
the
Rings
to
me
at
an
early
impressionable
age.
At
any
rate,
the
result
was
that
I
fell
into
the
same
trap
that
King,
Tolkien,
Asimov,
and
countless
other
fantasy
and
science
fiction
writers
had
fallen
into
before
me:
I
had
discovered
the
allure
of
the
massive,
bloated
fantasy
epic.
To
make
matters
worse,
that
little
smudgy
story
sat
partway
through
the
whole
overarching
plotline,
and
depended
on
characters
and
events
that
still
floated,
free
of
grammar,
in
my
head.
It
was,
therefore,
completely
incomprehensible
to
my
classmates.
Of
course,
I
realized
after
a
few
moments
of
reading
that
I
had
lost
my
audience.
I
kept
plowing
on,
but
it
was
obvious
that
a
veil
of
absolute
confusion
had
descended
upon
the
classroom.
Understandably,
I
felt
rather
uncomfortable
standing
up
there,
reciting
my
fragment
of
a
story.
I
sensed
even
faint
bamboozlement
from
my
teacher,
although,
to
her
credit,
she
tried
to
give
me
some
encouragement.
I
still,
even
after
this
experience,
persisted
in
creating
overblown
epics,
but
I
kept
them,
mercifully,
mostly
to
myself.
However,
and
despite
BartholomaeOs
evident
hatred
of
these
sorts
of
life
lesson
conclusions,
I
feel
like
I
received
in
that
moment
the
first
inklings
of
an
important
general
rule
in
writingNthe
author
must
consider
the
audience.
It
simply
is
not
enough
to
have
a
fantastic,
flashy
Idea.
It
has
to
be
presented
in
a
way,
and
in
a
context,
that
people
can
understand
and
enjoy.
I
think
for
a
time
I
forgot
my
own
possible
power
as
a
writer.
Perhaps
I
had
it
beaten
out
of
me
by
the
dreaded
Book
Review
assignments
that
came
once
a
month
for
several
years
in
Elementary
School.
I
despised
those
essays.
I
loved
reading
the
books,
of
course,
but
I
could
never
figure
out
how
to
respond
to
them.
Above
all,
I
struggled
with
the
introduction
and
conclusion
in
these
formulaic
little
essays.
What
was
there
to
say
beyond
what
I
said
in
the
body
paragraphs?
My
conclusions
followed
the
same
format,
down
to
even
the
major
words.
I
hoped
that
through
the
heavy
application
of
big
words
to
distract
any
readers
from
the
boring
repetition
of
my
conclusion.
At
some
point,
though,
I
began
to
realize
the
key
to
the
conclusion.
I
had
to
say
something
about
the
book
that
pulled
the
review
together
as
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts.
I
needed
to
look
at
the
paragraphs
on
the
characters,
the
easiness
of
the
book,
the
plot,
and
so
on,
and
see
how
they
connected
together.
I
wish
I
could
remember
when
exactly
this
happened.
I
suspect
that
it
was
less
a
particular
moment
than
it
was
a
summerOs
worth
of
brain
growth
that
gave
me
the
ability
to
see
beyond
the
immediate
format
of
the
report.
I
do
remember,
however,
putting
together
a
report
on
the
Wright
brothers
and
feeling
astonished
at
just
how
easily
the
words
came
to
me
as
I
scribbled
out
the
draft,
printing
so
that
the
unfamiliar
cursive
we
had
recently
learned
would
not
slow
me
down.
After
experiencing
that
kind
of
moment
of
enlightenmentNif
I
may
pause
and
jump
out
of
the
narrative
briefly
hereNI
paid
a
bit
more
attention
to
others
when
they
write
or
compose
ideas.
I
have
often
noticed
a
similar
kind
of
turning
point
where
a
writer
goes
from
confusion
to
clarity.
At
any
rate,
from
that
point
on
I
struggled
much
less
with
essays.
Of
course,
they
were
still
a
boring
chore,
because
I
had
to
follow
a
set
five
paragraph
format
that
stifled
my
creativity,
but
I
now
understood
better
how
the
arguments
held
together.
My
first
real
brush
with
creative
writing
in
a
more
academic
setting
came
in
my
senior
year
of
High
School.
My
AP
English
teacher
included,
as
part
of
our
exploration
of
literature,
a
gargantuan
final
project,
where
we
were
instructed
to
take
a
theme
and
express
that
theme
through
five
different
mediaNshort
stories,
poems,
play
scripts,
essays,
myths,
and
so
on.
At
the
time,
I
was
absolutely
besotted
with
T.
S.
Eliot,
and
so
the
work
that
resulted
contained
more
than
a
small
bit
of
influence
from
his
images
of
decaying
urban
haunts
and
alienation.
And,
of
course,
there
was
the
bloated
set
of
endnotes
that
accompanied
and
clarified
each
work.
I
included
the
endnotes
as
a
work
unto
themselves,
in
what
may
be
included
in
my
obituary
as
the
single
most
pretentious
act
of
my
life.
Still,
despite
the
overblown
nature
of
the
work,
my
teacher
continued
to
encourage
me
and
push
me
forward
with
the
project.
This
meant
the
world
to
me.
As
I
worked
through
draft
after
draft
of
the
stories
and
poems,
trying
to
tune
the
text
so
that
the
ideas
were
clear
but
not
intrusive,
I
knew
that
she
had
confidence
in
my
crazy
vision
of
a
choked,
silenced
landscape.
Because
of
her
belief
in
my
ability,
I
was
able
to
overcome
the
constant
anxieties
of
writing
in
order
to
create
something
that
even
now
I
am
still
proud
of.
The
most
significant
writing
experiences
in
college
came
from
my
experience
in
Lehigh
Carbon
Community
CollegeOs
Honors
Scholars
program.
As
part
of
the
program,
during
the
first
semester
all
of
the
participants
took
Speech
and
Philosophy,
and
during
the
second
semester
took
Sociology
and
Literature.
The
course
load
was
practically
designed
to
give
us
nervous
breakdowns,
and
most
of
us
experienced
at
least
one
or
two
sleepless
nights
of
panic
and
self-doubt
per
semester.
I
worked
under
truly
intense
conditions,
knowing
that
a
poorly
argued
or
unsupported
argument
would
be
torn
to
shreds.
It
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
where
outlining
was
more
than
useful,
it
was
a
necessity.
Every
argument
required
that
I
sit
and
draft
an
ugly,
sloppy
point
by
point
list
of
every
piece
of
evidence,
every
assumption,
every
conclusion.
Often
they
began
their
lives
in
the
typical
Roman
Numeral-Letter-Number
format,
only
to
suddenly
sprout
an
entire
paragraph
in
an
Na.O
or
Nb.O
section.
I
would
occasionally
add
to
the
confusion
by
printing
out
the
pages
and
scribbling
on
them.
Had
my
confidence
not
been
built
up
through
my
training
in
High
School,
I
am
not
sure
how
long
I
would
have
lasted.
The
most
arduous
task
for
Philosophy
was
the
argument
on
metaphysics,
where
I
decided
to
take
the
path
of
most
resistance
by
arguing
that
reality
was
a
construct
of
the
human
mind.
This
was,
in
retrospect,
a
silly
decision
born
as
much
out
of
contrariness
and
a
desire
to
be
right
as
of
real
conviction.
Still,
I
learned
from
the
struggle.
In
particular,
I
discovered
that
it
is,
in
fact,
alright
to
ask
a
professor
for
help.
I
e-mailed
my
professor
in
desperation,
and
he
picked
out
the
problems
with
my
outline
and
gave
suggestions
on
where
to
look
for
answers.
I
was
still
revising
bits
of
the
argument
as
I
stood
up
to
present
it
in
speech
form,
but
I
had
managed
to
pull
the
paper
together
into
something
workable.
I
can
hardly
describe
the
sense
of
satisfaction,
and
of
sheer
victory,
that
I
felt
when
I
got
the
paper
back
with
an
A
grade.
I
had
wrestled
with
complex
and
often
opaque
concepts
and
arrived
at
a
conclusion
that
may
not
have
been
right,
but
at
least
was
well
argued.
I
considered
rounding
this
essay
off
with
a
discussion
of
my
experiences
writing
this
essay,
but
after
much
deliberation
I
decided
that
this
sort
of
metatextual
game
pushed
the
boundaries
of
cheekiness
a
bit
too
far.
So,
I
will
finish
instead
by
relating
my
most
recent
experiences
with
posting
my
workNfictional
and
nonfictionalNonline.
My
last
experiences
are
best
understood
together,
because
the
two
works
stand
so
far
apart
in
their
reception.
Of
course,
the
comparison
would
fall
flat
if
they
had
nothing
in
common.
Both
experiences
involve
my
participation
in
online
communities.
They
both
involve
playing
around
with
fiction.
And,
for
the
most
part,
they
share
an
audience.
One
is
my
work
on
the
Expanded
Multiverse
Project
for
the
trading
card
game
Magic:
The
Gathering.
The
other
is
my
blog
about
media
and
academics.
Let
me
explain,
first,
what
The
Expanded
Multiverse
actually
consists
of.
The
project
takes
the
core
set
of
worlds,
characters,
and
stories
that
accompany
the
game,
and
expands
upon
them
in
order
to
create
a
large-scale,
self
consistent,
fan-built
setting.
Generally
that
involves
creating
new
characters
and
writing
about
them.
I
occupy
the
bureaucratic
end
of
the
project,
reviewing
the
works
of
others,
making
sure
none
of
the
stories
contradict
each
other,
seeing
places
where
the
histories
of
different
worlds
and
characters
might
link
up,
and
so
on.
It
is,
to
say
the
least,
rather
nerdy
stuff.
Still,
it
gives
me
the
chance
to
work
with
fiction
writers,
as
opposed
to
the
essay
writers
that
I
usually
tutor.
To
make
an
increasingly
longwinded
story
short,
I
recently
posted
a
draft
of
a
story
that
I
was
working
on
for
the
other
members
of
the
project
to
review.
They
hated
it.
It
was
an
absolute
catastrophe.
I
was
stunned
and
more
than
a
little
hurt,
especially
because
I
felt
that
their
criticism
hinged
less
upon
my
skills
as
a
writer
and
more
upon
the
particular
style
I
chose
to
write
in.
Simply
put,
I
included
as
little
descriptive
information
as
possible.
It
simply
did
not
interest
me.
The
shape
of
the
plot
and
the
particular
eventsNthat
core
ideaNappealed
to
me,
and
I
responded
by
cutting
out
detail
that
I
thought
of
as
unnecessary.
What
I
failed
to
consider
was
the
fact
that
the
people
reading
my
stories
came
to
them
with
particular
expectations
about
what
a
fantasy
story
is.
Typically,
fantasy
involves
an
abundance
of
adjectives
and
lots
of
detail
lavished
onto
the
setting
and
action.
So,
of
course
my
workNregardless
of
its
other
flaws
or
meritsNfell
flat.
It
wandered
too
far
from
the
expected
style,
and
that
prevented
the
ideas
from
shining
throughNthe
exact
opposite
of
my
intention.
The
work
that
I
have
done
for
my
blog
received
the
exact
opposite
reaction,
much
to
my
satisfaction.
There
I
set
out,
from
the
beginning,
to
write
in
an
academic
but
accessible
style.
People
read
the
articles
expecting
that
style,
so
the
ideas
registered
much
more
easily.
The
few
missteps
have
come
from
experiments
where
I
worked
in
a
different
style
or
medium,
and
lost
part
of
my
audience.
The
regularity
of
the
postsNI
always
put
out
at
least
three
articles
per
weekNand
the
freedom
to
experiment
with
a
fairly
consistent
audience
means
that
I
can
analyze
what
articles
fall
flat,
and
why.
This
kind
of
scientific
approach
allows
me
to
modify
what
IOm
doing
to
match
audience
expectations
while
still
surprising
them
with
new
ideas.
If
I
might
again,
despite
BartholomaeOs
profound
disapproval,
draw
some
general
conclusions
from
these
experiences,
I
think
they
have
helped
to
make
me
realize
what
I
really
love
about
writing.
When
I
sit
at
my
computer
and
begin
typing,
or
sit
at
my
desk
and
begin
scribbling
out
notes,
I
know
that
the
text
is
under
my
control.
Even
in
an
assignment
like
this,
where
the
topic
is
dictated
to
me
and
I
have
to
work
within
defined
parameters,
there
is
still
a
freedom
and
an
inherent
power
in
setting
my
fingers
and
mind
into
motion.
WhatOs
more,
I
have
the
chance
to
slide
into
the
heads
of
my
audience,
to
feel
out
their
expectations
and
preferences,
their
passionsNpositive
or
negative,
and
what
they
desire.
I
can
transmit
that
core
idea
in
a
way
they
will
understand.
And,
if
I
really
work
at
it,
and
take
all
of
my
experiences
and
knowledge
into
account,
I
can
inspire
others
to
take
the
same
path
and
discover
their
own
glowing,
powerful
thoughts.
