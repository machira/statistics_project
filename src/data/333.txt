Literacy
Narrative
2001-2002
Academic
Year
Going
into
the
2000-2001
academic
year
as
a
veteran
WA,
I
had
reached
the
pinnacle
of
my
writing
ability.
Or
so
I
thought.
It
turned
out
that,
even
after
two
appointment-filled,
critical
analysis-laden,
paper-reading
semesters,
there
was
still
much
I
did
not
know
about
writing.
In
fact,
the
confidence
that
came
with
being
a
veteran
WA
soon
changed
into
a
realization
that
I
still
had
much
to
learn.
That
being
done,
I
was
able
to
use
my
WA
experiences
to
become
a
better
writer,
and
at
the
same
time,
I
could
draw
on
my
writing
experiences
to
become
a
better
WA.
At
the
start
of
the
year,
my
standing
as
a
veteran
WA
gave
me
a
somewhat
overblown
confidence
in
my
own
writing.
Somewhere
in
the
back
of
my
mind,
I
considered
myself
the
cream
of
the
Lafayette
writing
crop.
This
attitude
continued
unchallenged
through
most
of
the
first
semester.
Then,
in
October,
I
received
a
completely
new
type
of
writing
assignment,
and
my
days
of
pomposity
suddenly
came
to
an
end.
The
assignment
itself
involved
writing
a
summary
of
the
economic
viability
of
a
certain
type
of
industry;
since
I
had
never
written
a
report
dealing
entirely
with
economics,
I
found
myself
unfamiliar
with
the
style,
terminology,
and
structure
that
I
was
expected
to
use.
My
immediate
reaction,
much
like
my
initial
response
to
most
uncomfortable
situations,
was
to
procrastinate.
And
procrastination
served
its
purpose
well,
for
a
while.
Ultimately,
though,
I
realized
that
I
would
have
to
devote
time
and
concentration
towards
learning
more
about
this
field
of
writing.
Before
I
could
start,
however,
I
had
to
admit
to
myself
(painfully,
of
course)
that
I
still
had
a
long
way
to
go
in
terms
of
being
a
truly
effective
and
versatile
writer.
Once
this
admission
was
over,
I
began
looking
at
other
documents
written
in
the
prescribed
style,
and
tried
my
best
to
capture
the
essence
of
the
writing
style.
In
the
end,
I
had
a
decent
final
report;
the
rustiness
was
due
to
inexperience,
rather
than
unwillingness
to
adapt
to
the
new
style.
At
the
risk
of
being
trite,
I
must
say
that
this
experience
made
me
a
better
WA.
Suddenly,
I
was
less
dismissive
of
a
paper
written
in
a
style
different
from
the
one
I
would
have
chosen
for
the
assignment.
So-called
bad7
papers
became
merely
different/
and
then
even
interesting/
Of
course,
there
was
the
occasional
assignment
that
was
clearly
written
by
an
inexperienced
writer,
but
most
were
simply
written
in
different
styles.
Then
the
wheel
turned
full
circle
:
I
saw
myself
beginning
to
pick
and
choose
various
stylistic
effects
from
other
students
writing.
In
the
middle
of
November,
I
read
a
paper
explaining
the
effects
of
Japanese
culture
on
the
nation's
sporting
achievements.
The
paper's
simplicity
and
struck
me;
highly
informal,
many
short,
self-contained
paragraphs,
and
a
very
direct
statement
of
facts
and
hypotheses,
even
provocative
ones.
I
tried
applying
this
to
my
next
engineering
report
(which,
as
a
whole,
tend
to
be
rigid,
formal,
and
even
stilted
at
times).
The
product
was
one
of
my
better
reports:
it
was
informative,
but
not
filled
with
engineering
jargon.
I
thus
ended
my
third
semester
as
a
WA
with
success.
The
WA-writer
interdependence
grew
even
stronger
in
the
spring
of
2001.
Prior
to
the
semester,
the
last
time
I
had
written
a
non-engineering
paper
in
English
was
the
spring
of
1999.
Thus,
when
I
had
to
write
a
12-page
paper
for
my
politics
class,
I
found,
to
my
shock,
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
major
challenge.
I
could
not
rely
on
a
preset
organization
sequence
(as
in
most
engineering
reports),
and
I
had
to
develop
my
own
outline.
Here,
being
a
WA
was
a
tremendous
help.
Although
I
had
not
written
such
a
paper
for
the
last
18
months,
I
had
read
plenty
of
them.
When
I
had
my
next
set
of
conferences,
I
focussed
on
the
organization
and
progression
of
each
student's
paper.
During
the
actual
meetings,
I
asked
the
students
how
they
had
decided
to
structure
their
paper.
A
week
later,
I
got
to
writing
my
own
paper,
and
I
tried
many
of
the
different
organizational
techniques
I
had
learned
during
the
conferences.
I
asked
myself,
what
about
this
method?
and
why
do
this?
Looking
back,
it
seems
I
became
my
own
WA
for
my
assignment.
On
the
whole,
the
past
year
was
a
year
of
questioning
established
traditions.
Earlier,
I
had
taken
any
previously
published
work
to
be
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
associated
with
the
genre.
A
magazine
article
was
always
perfectly
written,
a
novel
had
no
writing
errors,
a
textbook
was
composed
in
the
most
efficient
way.
After
coming
across
the
various
styles
used
by
my
fellow
students,
I
realized
that
this
was
not
always
true.
Magazine
articles
could
be
obscured
by
poor
writing,
novels
could
be
overly
stylized,
textbooks
could
be
deliberately
obscure.
In
retrospect,
I
see
that
I
began
to
read
all
work
in
a
critical
fashion,
not
just
the
essays
written
by
my
peers
and
me.
Being
a
WA
was
not
a
job
with
set
hours
and
clients,
but
closer
to
an
attitude
based
on
writing
skills.
The
more
I
was
a
WA,
the
more
I
began
to
wonder
why
works
were
written
a
certain
way.
The
more
I
questioned
these
other
forms
of
literature,
the
better
a
WA
I
became.
After
the
experiences
of
the
past
year,
I
would
definitely
change
some
of
the
attitudes
and
practices
I
had
during
my
first
year
as
a
WA.
The
first
would
be
my
sense
of
standing
as
a
writer
:
I
am,
and
will
never
be,
a
perfect
writer,
so
anything
I
say
regarding
anyone
else's
writing
is
not
necessarily
correct.
Although
this
realization
would
have
been
a
blow
to
my
fragile
confidence
as
a
first
year
WA,
I
feel
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
circumvent
any
unnecessary
feelings
of
superiority
towards
the
students
I
was
assisting.
I
would
also
have
been
able
to
incorporate
some
of
my
peers'
writing
practices
into
my
own
writing,
instead
of
simply
dismissing
others'
writing
as
inferior
to
my
own.
In
addition,
after
two
years
of
being
a
WA,
I
know
that
I
cannot
help
everyone.
Earlier,
I
took
a
lack
of
effort
by
a
student
as
a
personal
failure,
whether
it
was
my
fault,
their
fault,
or
both.
It
never
occurred
to
me
that
there
were
a
few
cases
where
I
simply
could
not
do
anything.
When
a
student
was
not
ready
for
a
conference,
it
was
more
productive
to
reschedule
than
to
have
a
conference
where
most
of
our
work
would
be
worthless.
If
I
had
known
this
right
from
the
beginning,
I
could
have
saved
myself
much
frustration
and
anguish,
as
well
as
extra
effort.
A
third
and
final
lesson
I
wish
I
had
learned
earlier
was
to
abandon
all
preconceptions
before
a
conference.
During
this
past
year,
I
was
surprised
to
see
that
I
was
more
effective
(in
my
own
view)
at
conferences
when
I
had
not
received
a
copy
of
the
student's
paper
beforehand.
Apparently,
I
had
been
evaluating
the
personal
and
social
skills
of
each
student
based
on
their
writing,
something
which
seems
ridiculous
in
retrospect.
When
I
read
a
paper,
I
created
a
mental
picture
of
the
student
and
his
attitude.
For
example,
a
poorly
written
paper
almost
always
coincided
in
my
mind
with
a
silent,
resentful
student.
Thus,
when
the
conference
began,
I
subconsciously
assumed
that
the
student
would
be
stubborn
and
unresponsive,
and
that
I
would
have
to
take
an
authoritative
role.
This
was
highly
counter-productive,
and
I
would
often
finish
a
conference
without
knowing
why
it
had
gone
so
badly.
Once
I
saw
that
my
(mostly)
misguided
preconceptions
were
creating
problems
during
conferences,
I
informed
my
second
semester
professor,
and
he
did
not
object
to
my
not
receiving
papers
in
advance.
Of
course,
this
was
the
easy
way
out;
during
the
upcoming
year,
I
hope
to
be
able
to
read
papers
in
advance
without
forming
a
mental
picture
of
the
student.
Over
the
past
year,
I
have
been
able
to
look
at
my
own
writing
and
attitude
from
a
more
objective
point
of
view.
By
encountering
new
challenges,
I
was
forced
to
search
for
and
adopt
new
writing
styles
which
I
might
have
shunned
earlier.
In
addition,
I
have
tried
to
prepare
myself
for
my
third
year
as
a
WA,
based
on
my
experiences
throughout
the
last
year.
I
can
see
now
what
I
need
to
do
right
from
the
start,
and
how
I
need
to
keep
from
becoming
too
rigid
or
set
in
my
own
writing
practices.
Strangely,
this
past
year
did
not
bring
any
major
strains
in
my
relationships
with
the
students
I
was
helping.
It
seems
that
I
had
to
become
comfortable
with
the
social
and
interpersonal
aspects
of
the
WA
position
before
I
could
really
progress
as
a
writer.
An
important
lesson
for
me,
and
I
learned
it
many
times
over
during
the
year.
