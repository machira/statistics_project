My
Recent
History
as
a
Writer
The
problem
with
writing
a
paper
about
my
recent
writing
experiences
is
that
recently,
within
say,
the
past
12
months,
I
have
not
written
a
heck
of
a
whole
lot.
In
fact,
the
volume
of
my
written
work
could
probably
be
counted
on
the
fingers
of
both
of
my
hands.
And
yes
my
hands
have
only
five
fingers
each.
Despite
the
fact
that
I
consider
myself
a
decent
writer,
and
that
the
WA
program
professors
also
seem
to
think
so
since
they
have
twice
given
me
the
chance
to
be
a
WA,
I
cannot
think
of
how
I
am
going
to
write
this
essay
when
my
writing
experiences
for
the
past
year
have
been
so
scant
and,
to
my
mind,
so
meaningless.
There
is
only
one
aspect
of
my
writing
which
I
feel
might
merit
some
discussion
here.
That
would
be
my
experiences
as
a
first
time
WA
last
fall
semester.
I
was
assigned
to
be
a
WA
for
an
FYS
class
on
Mexico.
Interestingly
enough,
this
was
the
same
FYS
and
the
same
professor
that
I
had
had
the
fall
before,
so
I
was
feeling
fairly
confident
of
my
abilities
to
relate
to
both
the
professor
and
to
the
students.
I
knew
the
writing
assignments,
was
vaguely
familiar
with
the
course
material,
and
got
along
well
with
the
professor,
having
also
had
him
for
another
class
as
well.
So
it
was
without
hesitation
that
I
called
the
professor
and
arranged
a
meeting
to
discuss
my
responsibilities
and
his
expectations.
Everything
went
very
well
at
our
conference.
I
felt
that
we
were
on
the
same
page
and
I
waited
enthusiastically
for
things
to
get
rolling.
The
professor
invited
me
to
attend
a
class
and
to
introduce
myself
to
the
students.
I
was
excited
by
the
prospect
of
meeting
the
bright-eyed
freshmen
that
I
envisioned
I
was
going
to
lead
down
the
path
of
writing
know-how,
inspiring
them
all
to
produce
grade
A
level
papers
and
sharing
with
them
the
joy
that
I
felt
in
practicing
and
exercising
confident,
strong
writing.
Looking
back
I
see
that
I
was
a
little
over-idealized.
Somewhere
along
the
path
to
confident
strong
writers
stood
the
attitudes
and
particular
writers'
blocks
of
13
unorganized
and
unmotivated
freshmen.
I
realize
now
that
had
I
handled
certain
situations
differently
I
could
have
made
my
WA
experience
much
more
fruitful.
My
biggest
problem
was
a
fear
of
forcefulness.
I
was
afraid
to
ask
my
professor
to
give
more
severe
punishments
to
those
students
who
missed
meetings.
The
silly
thing
is
I
think
that
he
would
have
done
it!
I
was
trying
too
hard
to
be
the
students'
friend
and
not
hard
enough
to
be
an
instructor
and
a
giver
of
well
thought
out
journalistic
advice.
I
believe
now
that
the
students
would
have
felt
more
of
a
connection
with
me
if
I
HAD
been
harder
on
them
about
their
written
work.
I
am
an
overly
positive
person.
I
always
tried
to
find
something
good
to
say
about
the
papers
that
I
read.
Unfortunately,
I
think
that
I
searched
so
much
for
good
things
in
the
papers
that
I
didn't
emphasize
the
places
where
things
needed
to
be
changed.
And
this
is
not
fair
to
the
students;
in
fact
it
is
my
failing
to
live
up
to
the
expectations
of
the
WA
program
as
a
whole.
I
ran
into
a
lot
of
students
in
my
little
FYS
class
who
were
perfectly
happy
to
have
someone
tell
them
that
their
paper
was
not
great....but
good
enough.
To
be
honest
most
of
my
students
were
not
the
young
writing
pioneers
that
I
had
hoped
they
would
be.
They
were
what
one
I;
might
expect
of
the
average
college
freshman:
struggling
to
get
everything
done
and
yet
still
save
some
time
to
explore
their
new
found
freedom
at
being
away
from
home.
As
a
result
I
had
my
share
of
missed
meetings
and
unfinished
papers,
or
meetings
where
there
was
no
paper
to
be
discussed.
During
times
such
as
these
I
would
try
to
draw
the
students
into
conversations
about
their
ideas
and
what
research,
if
any,
they
had
done
so
far.
I
felt
these
conversations
were
normally
far
from
productive.
Most
of
the
students
had
few
ideas
that
they
could
verbalize
without
first
beginning
their
writing.
With
a
few
I
tried
making
outlines,
or
generating
ideas,
but
this
was
generally
to
the
discouragement
of
all
involved.
The
students
were
often
bored
and
unresponsive,
and
I
felt
like
my
time
was
being
used.
I
wanted
to
be
reading
papers,
good
papers,
papers
that
they
had
prepared
on
time,
neatly,
and
in
a
carefully
thought
out
fashion.
Once
again
situations
such
as
these
might
have
been
prevented
if
I
had
communicated
more
fully
with
my
professor
at
the
beginning
of
the
semester
and
had
asked
him
to
enforce
missed
meetings
and
deadlines
more
seriously
than
he
did.
For
all
of
the
times
that
I
wished
I
were
not
a
WA,
there
were
also
times
that
I
felt
very
thankful
to
hold
the
position.
I
know
that
the
experience
helped
to
improve
my
writing,
especially
that
which
I
did
during
the
semester
that
I
worked
as
a
Writing
Associate.
I
learned
to
be
especially
critical
of
my
own
work.
Before
I
had
had
problems
stepping
back
and
being
able
to
look
at
my
own
writing
with
a
judicious
eye.
After
reading
some
of
my
students'
papers,
I
found
myself
consciously
checking
my
work
to
be
certain
that
it
was
free
of
the
errors
that
I
noted
in
theirs.
I
found
that
I
was
writing
more
directly
and
clearly.
My
theses
were
better
developed,
my
papers
more
organized
and
my
paragraphs
more
well
thought
out.
I
also
found
myself
better
able
to
brainstorm
ideas
for
papers.
And
sometimes
I
found
myself
using
the
same
advice
I
had
given
students
as
suggestions
on
where
to
begin
researching.
The
entire
writing
process,
from
planning
to
proofreading,
was
made
much
more
clear
to
me
when
I
found
myself
trying
to
explain
it
to
others.
Being
a
writing
associate
last
fall
was
not
always
easy.
But
it
was
also
not
without
reward.
I
learned
so
many
things
about
myself
as
a
writer
and
how
to
improve
myself.
I
must
admit
that
I
was
a
little
disappointed
because
my
expectations
for
my
students
were
not
completely
fulfilled,
but
instead
of
lowering
them
this
year
I
have
instead
raised
the
standards
for
myself
as
a
WA.
Last
time
wasn't
perfect,
but
I
think
this
time
I
can
do
better.
I
now
understand
just
how
important
communicating
effectively
with
the
professor
can
be.
That
is
where
I
plan
to
change
things
first.
From
then
on,
I
will
handle
things
as
they
come
up,
but
hopefully
I
can
put
to
use
some
of
the
things
that
I
learned
during
my
last
stint
as
a
WA.
With
a
semester's
worth
of
experience
behind
me,
I
am
ready
to
tackle
the
forthcoming
challenges
of
my
next
WA
assignment.
