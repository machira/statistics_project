Reflections
as
a
Writer
My
first
memories
of
writing
are
from
kindergarten
when
the
class
would
write
words
over
and
over
again
on
beige
paper
with
lines
that
were
an
inch
wide
I
was
always
neat
with
my
work,
mindful
of
keeping
my
handwriting
within
the
lines
and
making
the
humps
of
my
"h"'s
just
touch
the
center
dotted
line
Eventually
I
learned
to
write
sentences
on
that
same
type
of
paper,
and
I
remember
drawing
pictures
sometimes
to
go
along
with
a
sentence
I
also
vividly
recall
learning
cursive
writing,
I
was
given
a
notebook
that
contained
dotted
lines
and
a
picture
go
along
with
each
letter
that
I
learned
I
was
always
careful
with
my
work,
so
my
handwriting
was
always
very
neat
In
elementary
school,
I
wrote
fictional
stories
often.
The
class
had
time
allotted
each
day
to
work
on
stories,
I
always
enjoyed
this
writing
time,
although
I
sometimes
had
trouble
coming
up
with
ideas
for
my
stories.
My
elementary
school
also
"published"
our
books.
They
had
a
machine
that
bound
the
computer-printed
pages
together
inside
a
hard
cover,
A
space
was
left
at
the
ton
of
each
page
for
the
author
to
add
his
or
her
own
illustrations,
I
always
found
it
exciting
to
have
one
of
my
stories
made
into
a
book
In
third
grade
I
had
a
sort
of
unspoken
competition
with
a
friend
to
see
who
could
write
the
longest
story
.
Mine
got
to
be
about
13
pages
or
more,
.
but
I
never
finished
it
I
don't
think
it
was
that
interesting
of
a
story
anyway,
since
I
was
going
more
for
length
than
quality,
I
think
this
memory
shows
that
I
must
have
enjoyed
writing
at
that
age
The
main
type
of
report
writing
that
I
did
in
elementary'
school
was
writing
book
reports,
I
never
minded
writing
them
because
they
were
about
books
that
I
had
chosen.
Once
I
began
sixth
grade,
the
focus
of
writing
shifted
from
creative
writing
to
reports
and
informational
writing,
I
remember
writing
in
6th
grade
about
the
treatment
of
blacks
in
the
50's
and
60's
While
writing
that
paper,
I
had
trouble
putting
information
in
my
own
words
because
I
was
overly
concerned
with
expressing
the
same
meaning
as
the
author,
I
think
I
am
still
rather
wordy
with
my
writing
sometimes
because
I
want
to
make
sure
that
the
reader
understands
precisely
my
point.
When
I
began
to
write
serious
papers
in
high
school
I
would
always
write
in
a
notebook
first,
Sometimes
I
would
just
sort
of
jot
down
ideas,
making
a
kind
of
rough
outline
before
I
started
writing,
but
most
times
I
would
write
the
entire
paper
before
typing
it,
I
found
it
easier
to
get
my
thoughts
out
that
way
first.
It
was
ok
to
make
a
mess
of
a
page
since
I
knew
I
would
fix
it
when
I
typed
it.
While
writing
this
paper,
I
sort
of
reverted
back
to
this
old
method,
mostly
because
I
could
stay
outside
and
enjoy
the
sunshine
while
writing
on
paper,
but
also
because
this
method
allowed
me
to
write
down
my
thoughts
more
easily,
without
concern
for
finding
the
perfect
wording.
The
notebook
is
less
concrete
to
me
than
the
computer.
Eventually,
though,
I
learned
to
do
this
same
type
of
writing
on
the
computer,
just
jotting
down
sentences
and
ideas
and
later
adding
structure
to
the
paper
I
began
writing
like
that
at
the
end
of
high
school,
and
that
is
the
method
that
I
most
often
use
now.
Possibly
my
worst
writing
experience
occurred
in
ninth
grade.
My
English
teacher
was
not
very
helpful,
and
I
thought
she
was
overly
critical
of
my
work.
After
taking
her
class,
I
was
not
very'
enthusiastic
about
anything
literary.
Another
reason
for
my
discouragement
stemmed
from
the
poor
choice
of
required
readings
in
high
school,
I
found
many
of
the
novels
we
read
uninteresting,
They
did
not
leave
much
to
the
imagination.
Since
I
didn't
like
most
of
the
books,
I
didn't
enjoy
writing
about
them
either.
My
older
sister
was
always
a
strong
writer.
She
sometimes
helped
me
edit
my
naners,
but
she
did
so
in
a
sort
of
patronizing
wav
that
caused
me
to
ston
asking
her
for
help.
This
was
another
one
of
the
few
negative
experiences
I
have
had
with
writing.
As
high
school
went
on,
however,
I
became
more
interested
in
my
English
classes,
and
I
began
to
seek
exposure
to
more
creative
writing
opportunities.
Working
on
"Windscript,
"
my
high
school
literary
magazine,
was
a
major
influence
for
me
on
the
creative
side
of
writing
The
magazine
is
known
for
its
quality
and
high
standards
It
gained
this
reputation
mainly
because
the
advisor
is
obsessed
with
winning
awards
for
it
each
year
in
a
national
competition.
In
my
opinion,
she
was
a
little
too
concerned
with
the
aspect
of
winning
a
wards,
so
much
so
that
she
made
the
staff,
which
I
was
a
part
of
for
three
years,
work
too
many
late
nights
and
weekends.
However,
my
hard
work
on
the
magazine
was
worth
it
in
several
ways.
To
me
the
magazine
was
a
vehicle
for
exposing
students
to
the
work
of
other
students,
and
for
allowing
student
writers
to
be
recognized
for
their
work.
Therefore,
I
felt
that
I
was
working
toward
a
noble
cause.
Working
on
the
magazine
also
helped
me
in
other
wavs.
For
example,
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
piece
should
go
in
the
magazine,
the
entire
staff
of
the
magazine
would
vote.
This
process
exposed
me
to
other
people's
writing,
and
taught
me
how
to
read
creative
writing
in
a
critical
way.
The
magazine
also
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
write
creatively
myself.
In
addition
to
poems,
I
had
a
non-fiction
piece
published
in
the
magazine,
based
on
the
story
of
a
foreign
exchange
student
who
was
visiting
my
school
from
Japan,
I
wrote
the
story
in
collaboration
with
my
best
friend,
and
we
ended
up
winning
an
award
for
it
in
the
national
competition
that
year
The
exposure
to
my
friend's
writing
style
opened
me
up
to
a
new
way
of
thinking
about
writing.
She
helped
me
develop
a
more
free-flowing
style
that
I
often
use
in
my
journal
writing,
poetry,
and
school
writing,
In
addition,
my
work
on
the
magazine
opened
me
up
to
the
possibility
of
working
for
a
publication
in
the
future
I
think
my
feelings
about
myself
as
a
writer
were
totally
transformed
throughout
my
last
two
years
of
high
school
In
my
junior
year,
I
had
decided
to
take
the
regular
English
class
instead
of
the
more
advanced
class
that
I
had
been
in
each
previous
year.
My
unfortunate
experience
in
ninth
grade
and
my
dislike
of
the
required
10th
grade
reading
led
up
to
this
decision
The
advanced
classes
had
always
contained
the
same
twenty
or
so
people--
the
more
bright
and
hard-working
people
in
my
school.
Being
in
a
class
with
new
people
exposed
me
to
a
much
wider
range
of
ability
levels
that
I
had
forgotten
existed,
I
had
previously
always
been
with
the
same
twenty
people
who
were
in
all
the
advanced
classes,
so
they
were
the
only
people
I
had
to
compare
myself
to
Now
I
could
see
why
I
had
been
in
the
more
advanced
class;
this
lower
lever
class
was
not
at
all
challenging
for
me
However,
I
found
the
teacher
intimidating;
I
thought
he
would
be
a
harsh
judge
of
my
work,
since
he
also
taught
the
advanced
class
He
knew
my
sister
well,
and
she
was
also
a
strong
writer,
so
I
assumed
he
would
compare
my
work
to
hers.
Throughout
the
year,
however,
he
gave
me
nothing
hut
positive
feedback.
In
fact,
at
one
point
he
even
mentioned
the
high
quality
of
my
writing
to
a
friend
of
mine
who
was
taking
his
more
advanced
class.
His
encouragement
gave
me
much
more
confidence,
so
I
asked
him
to
move
me
up
to
the
higher
level
class
in
my
senior
year.
When
I
began
Mrs,
Black's
Advanced
Placement
English
class
in
my
senior
year,
I
really
felt
like
I
belonged
there
Mrs,
Black
is
probably
my
favorite
teacher
as
well
as
my
biggest
influence
in
writing,
She
taught
me
so
much
both
about
writing,
about
myself,
and
about
how
I
could
use
the
study
of
English
to
enhance
my
life.
The
confidence
that
I
now
have
in
my
writing
stems
from
her
praise
and
guidance
Her
class
was
a
creative
outlet
for
me
through
exercises
like
stream
of
consciousness
writing
and
poetry
discussion.
She
encouraged
me
to
continue
my
literary
studies
beyond
high
school,
which
was
an
option
that
I
would
most
likely
not
have
pursued
if
not
for
her
influence.
In
her
class,
I
also
became
a
better
writer
in
terms
of
grammar
and
mechanics
The
final
project
of
the
year
was
a
fift
een
page
research
paper
that
was
to
include
a
biography
of
an
author
and
an
analysis
of
his
or
her
work,
I
wrote
about
George
Orwell,
since
my
favorite
book
at
the
time
was
Nineteen-eighty-four
Even
though
the
naner
was
the
longest
I
had
ever
written,
I
still
en
joyed
writing
it
because
of
the
challenge
it
presented
and
my
interest
in
the
topic
After
completing
Mrs
Black's
class,
and
especially
after
writing
that
naner,
I
felt
well
prepared
for
college
writing.
My
expectations
about
college
writing
were
confirmed
in
my
FYS,
In
this
class,
I
met
another
teacher
who
helped
build
my
confidence
in
writing
This
professor
was
very
enthusiastic
in
leading
class
discussions,
and
his
enthusiasm
rubbed
off
on
me.
He
always
had
something
good
to
say
about
my
papers,
helping
to
further
build
my
confidence
in
writing.
I
had
a
lot
of
fun
writing
papers
for
that
class
because
I
found
the
tonics
both
interesting
and
challenging.
I
have
never
taken
a
creative
writing
class,
but
I
would
love
to
take
one,
I
am
hoping
to
take
the
one
offered
at
Lafayette.
Since
I
began
at
Lafayette
two
years
ago,
I
have
not
written
as
much
poetry
as
I
did
in
high
school,
I
think
a
creative
writing
class
would
give
me
an
opportunity
to
write
in
a
more
poetic
style
again,
and
expose
me
to
other
types
of
writing.
One
of
my
favorite
kinds
of
writing
to
do
is
stream-of-consciousness
writing,
because
it
lets
me
record
my
thoughts
in
their
purest
form.
It
is
the
only
type
of
writing
that
I
can
do
without
any
kind
of
judgment
for
the
writing
itself
In
other
words,
I
am
not
concerned
with
whether
the
writing
itself
is
good
or
ba
d;
I
am
only
concerned
with
getting
my
thoughts
down
on
the
paper.
This
type
of
writing
is
relaxing
for
me
in
that
sense,
I
like
to
do
stream-of-consciousness
writing
in
my
journal
I
have
written
in
a
journal
on
and
off
throughout
my
entire
life.
I
mostly
write
during
periods
of
indecision
in
my
life,
as
many
people
do,
to
help
me
sort
out
my
feelings
and
decide
what's
best
Looking
back
through
my
journal,
I
can
see
how
I
have
progressed
as
a
writer.
By
far,
my
favorite
things
to
read
from
my
writing
past
are
the
poems.
I
began
writing
poetry
in
high
school--
mostly
poems
expressing
angst
and
sorrow,
since
high
school
was
sort
of
a
depressing
time
for
me.
My
best
poems
come
from
times
when
I
was
really
unset,
or
feeling
some
other
intense
emotion.
When
I
read
my
old
poems,
I
can
often
remember
how
I
felt
when
I
wrote
them,
even
though
I
wrote
some
of
them
as
many
as
five
years
ago
My
poems
are
very
personal,
so
my
best
friend
and
boyfriend
are
the
only
people
who
I
regularly
share
them
with,
but
I
have
Had
a
few
poems
published
in
my
high
school
literary'
magazine.
At
this
point
in
my
life
I
feel
confident
in
mv
writing
abilities,
but
I
also
feel
like
they
could
be
developed
so
much
more.
I
am
looking
forward
to
taking
more
English
classes
at
Lafayette,
and
using
the
WA
experience
to
help
strengthen
my
writing
and
editing
skills.
