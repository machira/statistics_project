Literary
Narrative
My
first
attempts
at
writing
were
only
colorful
crayon
scribbles
on
pieces
of
paper,
but
long
before
I
entered
kindergarten
my
parents
were
teaching
me
to
write
the
letters
L-A-U-R-A.
Then
I
learned
to
string
letters
together
into
words
and
sentences
and,
by
the
age
of
seven,
reading
and
writing
became
wonderful
and
powerful
forces
in
my
life.
Learning
to
write
was
the
focus
of
kindergarten
and
first
grade.
Our
writing
was
repetitive,
short
and
factual,
the
same
simple
words
and
phrases
written
and
read
over
and
over
again.
We
used
the
paper
with
rbigs
linesiaalternating
solid
and
dashed
linesiaso
that
our
letters
fit
as
neatly
as
possible
into
the
prescribed
space,
and
we
learned
the
correct
way
to
write
before
each
student
developed
her
own
handwriting
style.
By
second
grade,
the
physical
act
of
writing
no
longer
required
intense
concentration,
and
we
were
able
to
use
writing
to
express
ourselves.
Our
writing
assignments
were
a
combination
of
descriptions
of
books
and
rstudent
of
the
weeks
papers.
Even
at
that
age,
writing
with
correct
grammar
was
important
to
me.
While
writing
a
paper
explaining
why
my
classmate
James
was
worthy
of
being
the
student
of
the
week,
I
dithered
so
long
over
the
correct
punctuation
when
writing
the
possessive
form,
rJamesu
favorite
game
isis
that
I
never
finished
the
paper.
I
first
remember
using
writing
in
addition
to
other
forms
of
presentation
when
I
did
a
book
report
on
Little
House
on
the
Prairie
in
second
grade.
To
give
the
report,
I
dressed
up
as
Ingalls
Wilder
and
baked
cookies,
as
well
as
writing
a
short
report
and
presenting
it
to
the
class.
We
learned
that
writing
could
improve
the
things
we
already
knew
aboutiaplaying
dress-up
and
eatingiaand
that,
vice
versa,
creativity
would
enhance
our
writing.
In
third
grade,
a
new
twist
was
added
to
the
process
of
writing:
we
were
taught
cursive.
I
had
already
tried
to
teach
myself,
through
a
combination
of
an
old
school
book
of
my
motherus
and
attempts
to
decipher
the
handwritten
diary
entries
in
the
Baby-sitterus
Club
books.
Cursive
writing
almost
seemed
like
a
new
language;
it
made
the
act
of
writing
fun
and
challenging
again.
Throughout
elementary
school
I
was
taught
many
different
genres
of
writing,
including
short
stories,
reports,
and
news
stories.
In
fifth
grade,
I
had
a
wonderful
teacher,
Mrs.
Klein.
She
encouraged
me
to
read
more
challenging
books,
and
introduced
me
to
one
of
my
favorites,
To
Kill
a
Mockingbird.
Mrs.
Klein
wanted
her
students
to
be
creative,
and
so
had
us
do
monthly
book
reports
for
which
we
were
not
allowed
to
simply
write
an
essay.
For
each
book
report
we
had
to
come
up
with
a
creative
way
of
presenting
our
book.
My
most
memorable
report
was
on
a
book
called
Quest
for
a
Maid,
by
Frances
Mary
Hendry,
a
novel
set
in
13th
century
Scotland.
I
incorporated
the
Old
Scottish
vocabulary
used
in
the
novel
and
rewrote
the
familiar
story
rLittle
Red
Riding
Hood.s
Renamed
rWee
Red
Capuchon,s
my
short
story
told
the
same
tale
using
the
phrases
and
words
I
had
read
in
Quest
for
a
Maid.
This
was
a
wonderful
writing
experience
for
me.
I
spent
hours
poring
over
the
glossary
in
the
back
of
my
novel,
finding
as
many
words
that
could
be
used
in
rLittle
Red
Riding
Hoods
as
I
could
and
then
writing
a
story
that
was
understandable
even
with
the
obsolete
words.
My
mother,
as
always,
helped
me
edit
it.
rWee
Red
Capuchons
was
a
success.
Mrs.
Klein
loved
it,
giving
me
a
lot
of
positive
feedback
and
praise,
both
for
the
unique
idea
and
for
the
writing
style.
Her
support
gave
me
confidence
in
my
writing.
While
I
was
in
elementary
school,
we
were
not
required
to
do
our
writing
on
computers,
although
the
number
of
families
with
computers
was
rising.
Writing
rWee
Red
Capuchon,s
though,
was
one
of
the
occasions
during
which
a
computer
was
immensely
helpful
to
my
writing.
It
made
editing
easier,
both
rewording
the
story
as
I
wrote
it
and
then
editing
after
it
was
written.
As
I
entered
middle
school,
we
were
required
more
and
more
to
turn
in
written
work
that
was
typed
on
a
computer.
Because
of
that,
Iuve
developed
a
very
computer-based
writing
habit,
and
rarely
write
even
the
shortest
essay
by
hand.
I
delete,
cut
and
paste,
and
use
the
computerus
thesaurus,
taking
advantage
of
how
easy
it
is
to
revise
as
I
write
with
a
computer.
In
middle
school,
the
Parent-Teacher
Association
sponsored
contests
in
which
the
students
had
to
turn
in
a
piece
of
writing
or
artwork
that
represented
a
chosen
theme
or
topic.
When
I
was
in
seventh
grade,
the
theme
was
rReflections,s
and
entries
could
be
any
style
of
writing,
from
essays
to
poetry.
I
wrote
a
short
story
about
a
familyus
love
for
one
another.
To
my
astonishment,
I
won.
I
think
that
creativity
again
played
a
large
role
in
making
the
story
a
strong
piece
of
writing;
the
fictional
story
was
a
change
from
the
essays
that
rreflecteds
on
peace
or
happiness
that
most
students
entered.
Winning
the
contest,
and
a
twenty-five
dollar
check,
was
surprising
and
flattering.
In
high
school,
the
opportunities
for
creative
writing
lessened
and
much
more
emphasis
was
placed
on
essays
and
research
papers.
In
tenth
grade,
every
student
had
to
take
the
dreaded
writing
test,
in
which
we
had
to
write
a
standard
five
paragraph
essay
on
a
given
rprompt,s
or
subject,
to
prove
that
the
school
system
was
teaching
its
students
how
to
read
and
write.
For
the
two
years
before
the
test,
this
is
the
type
of
writing
we
practiced.
We
read
books
that
were
most
likely
to
lend
themselves
to
answering
the
prompts
and
wrote
papers
that
followed
a
set
structure.
My
tenth
grade
teacher,
in
particular,
had
a
very
formulaic
approach
to
writing.
Mrs.
Grant
was
one
of
the
very
few
teachers
that
I
did
not
like;
hers
was
the
only
English
class
Iuve
ever
strongly
disliked.
We
received
bad
grades
on
essays
that
did
not
follow
her
prescribed
formula
and
she
refused
to
allow
us
to
develop
our
own
style.
She
was
a
teacher
who
truly
taught
to
the
test
and
though
I
was
capable
of
writing
that
way
to
satisfy
her
and
make
a
good
grade,
I
donut
feel
that
she
was
a
good
influence
on
my
writing.
With
the
writing
test
out
of
the
way,
my
eleventh
and
twelfth
grade
teachers
were
able
to
focus
on
developing
our
skills
at
writing
longer
essays
that
provided
more
in-depth
analysis
of
the
literature
we
read.
These
classes
also
demanded
a
research
paper,
eight
to
ten
pages
in
length.
In
writing
these
papers,
I
learned
how
to
choose
a
good
topic,
do
extensive
research,
write
a
long
paper,
and
use
citations.
In
twelfth
grade,
every
senior
was
required
to
complete
a
Senior
Exit
Project,
which
included
writing
a
research
paper,
creating
a
rproducts
based
on
our
research,
and
doing
a
presentation
in
front
of
a
panel.
Doing
a
research
project
of
such
length
and
magnitude
was
a
daunting
task,
but
it
ended
up
being
a
very
rewarding
experience.
I
learned
how
to
use
note
cards
to
make
research
easier
and
how
to
organize
my
research
so
that
when
I
began
to
write,
all
of
the
information
for
the
paper
was
ready,
waiting
only
for
me
to
put
it
into
words.
The
research
for
my
topic,
propaganda
in
World
War
I,
was
interesting;
I
looked
at
colorful
posters
and
humorous
songs
promoting
the
war
effort.
There
was
a
feeling
of
immense
satisfaction
when
I
felt
all
the
various
pieces
of
information
fall
into
place
and
create
a
unified
paper.
It
is
a
feeling
I
have
learned
to
recognize
while
writingiathe
point
where
I
sense
that
everything
will
come
together
into
a
well-constructed
paper.
I
received
a
lot
of
helpful
advice
and
support
from
my
teachers
and
parents
while
working
on
the
Senior
Exit
Project.
Procrastination
was
prevented
by
deadlines
for
our
thesis,
our
research,
and
our
rough
and
final
drafts.
The
feedback
I
received
after
each
deadline
was
adequate
to
help
me
move
forward,
and
my
parents
helped
by
reading
and
editing
the
paper.
Writing
that
paper
was
one
of
the
best
writing
experiences
I
have
had
because
the
writing
process
in
that
situation
was
so
thorough.
I
went
carefully
through
each
step
of
the
writing
process,
from
the
initial
brainstorming
sessions
to
the
final
draft.
I
think
that
all
of
the
time
I
spent
working
on
the
paper
was
useful
and
that
no
phase
was
hurried
or
abbreviated,
which
provided
me
with
a
complete
writing
experience.
And
then
came
college.
Suddenly,
ten-page
papers
were
not
yearlong
projects.
They
were
just
another
assignment,
to
be
crammed
in
along
with
my
daily
workload
and
the
two
other
ten-page
papers
due
that
week.
Iuve
found
that
it
is
much
easier
to
procrastinate
without
parents
and
teachers
to
keep
me
focused,
and
it
is
much
harder
to
write
a
strong
paper
when
I
am
rushed.
Despite
that,
I
feel
that
I
was
prepared
for
the
level
of
writing
required
in
college.
In
middle
school
and
high
school
most
of
my
teachers
helped
me
with
my
writing
style.
I
practiced
enough
literary
essays
and
research
papers
to
become
comfortable
with
those
genres,
and
the
skills
needed
for
writing
those
papers
transfer
easily
to
most
other
types
of
writing
Iuve
encountered
in
college.
The
biggest
change
from
high
school
to
college
is
that
nearly
all
of
the
classes
Iuve
taken
at
Lafayette,
with
the
exception
of
math
and
science,
have
required
writing.
In
high
school,
very
few
non-English
classes
involved
extensive
writing.
I
have
written
papers
on
a
range
of
topics
that
I
otherwise
would
not
have
covered
without
the
extensive
writing
base
that
college
courses
have.
This
has
included
learning
new
writing
genres.
In
a
womenus
history
class
at
Lafayette,
I
was
assigned
to
write
an
oral
history
paper.
For
it,
I
conducted
two
oral
interviews,
with
my
mother
and
my
grandmother,
and
wrote
the
paper
based
on
the
stories
they
told
me
about
their
lives.
Incorporating
oral
and
written
storytelling
was
a
new
experience
for
me.
I
recently
took
a
Lafayette
interim
trip
to
Germany,
where
another
writing
skill
was
developed.
We
were
required
to
write
about
the
trip
in
a
daily
journal,
to
describe
the
sights
we
saw
as
well
as
our
feelings
about
our
experiences.
It
was
meant
to
both
record
all
that
we
saw
over
the
three
week
long
trip
and
to
explore
our
emotions
as
we
came
in
touch
with
new
places
and
cultures
and
learned
about
their
often
turbulent
history.
It
was
a
wonderful
assignment,
because
it
allowed
us
to
process
each
experience
almost
immediately
and
it
left
us
with
a
record
with
which
we
can
look
back
and
remember.
Because
we
were
required
to
complete
the
journal
daily,
mine
is
very
thorough.
I
do
write
informally
in
a
private
journal,
but
only
sporadically.
During
high
school,
a
friend
who
was
reading
The
7
Habits
of
Highly
Effective
People
told
me
that
writing
in
a
journal
was
one
habit
recommended
by
the
book.
Deciding
that
I,
too,
wanted
to
be
an
effective
person,
I
went
home
and
began
a
journal.
Though
Iuve
repeatedly
tried
and
failed
to
write
in
it
consistently,
my
journal
has
been
a
wonderful
release
at
times
when
I
am
upset
or
confused.
It
is
calming
to
write
my
thoughts
down
on
paper
and
comforting
to
look
back
through
it
and
remember
past
events
in
my
life.
Remembering
my
past
writing
experiences
while
preparing
this
paper
has
caused
me
to
rethink
how
I
write
today.
When
creative
writing
stopped
being
assigned
in
favor
of
more
racademics
writing
genres
in
middle
school
and
high
school,
I
virtually
stopped
writing
fictional
stories.
For
the
past
few
years,
I
have
considered
myself
to
be
incompetent
at
writing
fiction.
Instead,
perhaps,
I
am
merely
out
of
practice.
Remembering
fiction
I
wrote
when
I
was
much
younger
makes
me
realize
that
I
couldiaand
shouldiawrite
stories
again
at
some
point.
I
love
to
read
and
I
think
that
most
people
who
love
to
write
also
love
to
read.
I
am
grateful
to
my
grateful
to
my
parents
for
reading
to
me
as
a
child
and
giving
me
the
gift
of
a
love
of
words.
My
mother
has
edited
nearly
every
paper
I
have
turned
in;
she
helps
me
to
clarify
both
my
thoughts
and
my
style.
No
doubt
she
has
looked
at
this
paper
as
well.
Feedback
and
praise
from
teachers
over
the
years
have
given
me
confidence
in
my
writing,
but
not
over-confidence.
There
will
always
be
areas
that
need
development
and
things
that
I
can
improve.
I
think
that
looking
critically
at
othersu
papers
as
a
Writing
Associate
will
further
help
me
as
a
writer,
because
I
will
be
exposed
to
so
many
different
techniques
and
styles
of
writing.
