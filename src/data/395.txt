The
Chronology
of
a
Writer
My
literary
career
started
at
the
age
of
three
with
a
thrilling
short
story
about
a
man,
his
horse
and
the
eternal
battle
between
vampires
and
humans.
It
was
originally
scrawled
on
three
pieces
of
ruled
paper
procured
from
a
hotel
room,
and
was
simply
called
The
Man.
It
has
inexplicably
been
photocopied
several
times
since
by
adoring
parents,
much
to
the
embarrassment
of
the
author.
The
next
ten
years
saw
a
steady
flow
of
assorted
forms
of
creative
writing,
ranging
from
OThe
VampierO
(the
equally
thrilling
sequel
to
The
Man)
to
mystery
stories
written
for
school
assignments.
The
educational
system
in
India
is
based
upon
the
traditional
British
approach
in
which
rigorous
creative
writing
is
a
staple
of
the
curriculum
-
all
the
way
from
the
first
to
the
sixth
grade.
Although
this
was
despised
by
many,
I
found
it
quite
to
my
liking
as
it
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
do
in
class
what
I
enjoyed
doing
in
my
spare
time
at
home.
My
early
exposure
to
writing
gave
me
a
command
over
the
language
that
was
shared
only
by
a
few
other
budding
fourth-grade
writers.
Encouraged
by
our
teachers,
our
little
literary
group
began
an
unspoken
competition
to
publish
as
many
pretentious-sounding
stories
as
we
could
in
the
school
literary
magazine.
Being
the
slightly
arrogant
literary
figure
that
I
was
in
elementary
school,
I
prided
myself
in
the
fact
that
I
only
ever
wrote
about
what
I
wanted
to
write
about
D
even
for
school
assignments.
I
would
take
any
idea
that
caught
my
fancy
and
bend
it
to
fit
an
assignment,
resulting
in
essays
on
topics
like
OA
Day
at
the
BeachO
somehow
involving
murder
mysteries
set
in
the
future.
Of
course,
the
story
would
start
with
me
spending
a
day
at
the
beach
(as
per
the
assignment)
D
but
on
another
planet.
I
would
then
discover
a
human
skeleton
buried
in
the
sand,
do
some
investigating,
ingeniously
abduct
the
murderer
and
wrap
up
the
case
before
dinnertime.
My
teachers
would
usually
love
it,
and
it
made
otherwise
mundane
literary
tasks
a
genuine
challenge.
However,
in
spite
of
my
growing
vocabulary
and
sometimes-bizarre
essays,
I
always
felt
that
there
was
something
fundamental
missing
in
my
writing.
I
used
all
the
big
words
that
were
used
in
Ogrown-upO
books,
but
somehow
grown-ups
didnOt
seem
to
place
my
collected
stories
next
to
their
copies
of
Dominique
Lapierre.
***
As
I
progressed
through
middle
school,
I
still
found
something
lacking
in
my
creative
writing.
It
wasnOt
a
technical
flaw
D
it
was
just
that
missing
magical
element
that
jumps
out
of
good
writing
and
seizes
the
reader
no
matter
who
or
what
age
the
reader
is.
Since
I
could
see
no
rational
reason
for
my
lack
of
attachment
to
my
writing,
my
enthusiasm
waned
as
I
entered
high
school.
Fortunately,
my
family
moved
to
the
Middle
East
at
the
beginning
of
my
senior
year
and
I
started
going
to
an
international
school
staffed
by
some
truly
intrepid
teachers.
My
English
teacher
D
a
stereotypical
wizened
old
man
who
had
traveled
the
world
-
took
a
special
interest
in
me
and
over
the
year
and
introduced
to
me
the
totally
alien
concept
of
focused
analytical
writing.
Extended
analytical
writing
was
a
whole
new
school
of
thought
for
me.
I
had
dealt
with
the
genre
before
as
short
questions
and
answers
in
middle
school
exams,
but
had
never
written
extended
essays
analyzing
literary
works.
It
seemed
to
go
against
the
very
philosophy
of
writing
as
I
had
understood
it
-
why
would
you
want
to
make
your
writing
drawn-out,
dry
and
narrow
in
scope
when
you
could
so
easily
explore
whimsical
abstract
concepts
that
novels
like
The
Great
Gatsby
offered?
As
senior
year
progressed
and
I
got
closer
to
college
life,
my
understanding
and
appreciation
of
analytical
writing
grew.
I
no
longer
saw
it
as
a
dreary,
almost-scientific
assignment
but
as
a
way
to
clearly
express
my
interpretation
of
the
facts
that
the
author
was
trying
to
convey.
I
realized
that
behind
every
single
writing
style
lies
a
simple
idea
D
the
conveyance
of
a
message
or
an
idea.
This
brought
about
a
paradigm
change
in
my
approach
to
writing
and
even
reading
literature
in
general.
I
now
saw
analytical
writing
as
a
means
of
achieving
that
perfect
piece
of
writing.
By
analyzing
what
I
had
written
(even
other
analytical
essays)
in
a
completely
independent
and
objective
manner,
I
could
better
understand
the
message
that
the
reader
would
think
that
I
was
trying
to
get
across.
That
emotion
that
I
had
felt
missing
in
my
creative
writing
had
actually
been
there
all
the
while
D
I
just
had
to
make
sure
that
the
choice
and
flow
of
words
had
the
same
emotional
connotations
that
I
wanted
them
to
have.
The
depth
of
feeling
in
works
as
powerful
as
Death
of
a
Salesman
became
more
evident
to
me
through
analytical
essays
and
brought
about
not
only
a
change
in
my
style
as
a
writer,
but
in
my
outlook
on
human
psychology.
Analytical
essays
transformed
books
that
I
might
otherwise
have
found
boring
into
living,
breathing
entities.
They
were
the
creations
of
a
human
mind
and
as
such
offered
a
fascinating
insight
into
someone
elseOs
thinking
process
D
insight
that
could
only
truly
be
gained
by
shaping
observations
and
ideas
about
a
book
into
a
polished
seven-page
product.
I
had
an
initial
tendency
to
rely
on
elaborate
language
to
produce
an
impressive-sounding
paper.
However,
my
teacher
would
always
mark
me
down
for
it
and
insist
that
I
use
simple,
lucid
language
to
express
my
ideas.
My
weapons
of
choice
disallowed,
I
was
forced
to
think
a
lot
more
about
my
ideas
and
what
exactly
I
was
trying
to
say,
rather
than
just
find
a
nice
way
to
express
under-developed
thoughts.
It
was
the
first
time
since
fourth
grade
that
I
grew
as
a
writer,
and
when
I
graduated
from
high
school
I
was
confident
that
I
could
handle
anything
college
had
in
store
for
me.
***
College
life
is
very
effective
at
bringing
people
down
to
size.
My
first
(and
incidentally,
last)
experience
with
a
course
at
Lafayette
that
required
papers
to
be
written
was
my
First
Year
Seminar.
The
class
I
had
been
assigned
to
was
my
first
choice
and
I
was
extremely
enthusiastic
about
dealing
with
the
same
genre
of
literature
as
my
first
literary
attempt
fourteen
years
prior.
My
professor
was
truly
an
extraordinary
person
and
I
felt
at
ease
with
every
aspect
of
my
class
work
D
right
up
till
the
first
writing
assignment
was
handed
out.
Unlike
high
school,
I
now
had
a
deadline,
a
very
abstract
analytical
topic
and
access
to
someone
called
a
OWriting
AssociateO.
I
wish
that
I
could
say
that
I
planned
my
paper
weeks
in
advance,
wrote
several
drafts
and
effectively
used
the
Writing
AssociateOs
advice,
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
fourteen
hour,
caffeine-fueled
experience
in
the
basement
of
Marquis
Hall
with
me
frantically
seeking
out
abstract
connections
between
a
novel
and
a
film
while
trying
to
beat
the
sunrise.
I
learned
a
lot
that
night
D
not
only
about
the
subject
matter
but
also
about
how
analytical
writing
is
really
just
a
scientific
dissection
of
a
creative
work.
At
the
end
of
my
freshman
year,
I
was
involved
in
research
with
the
Physics
Department
and
had
to
familiarize
myself
with
the
scientific
style
of
writing,
which
at
first
can
seem
like
pretentious
gibberish
to
the
untrained
eye.
Being
somewhat
familiar
with
pretentious
styles
of
writing,
I
was
able
to
acquaint
myself
with
the
style
fairly
easily.
Scientific
writing
was
yet
another
new
paradigm
for
me.
Even
tighter
and
stricter
than
the
analysis
of
literature,
the
smallest
error
in
flow
or
structure
could
alter
a
critical
readerOs
perception
of
the
ideas
presented
and
negate
the
whole
purpose
of
the
writing.
On
the
other
hand,
I
noticed
that
pretentious
style
and
jargon
often
covered
up
a
lack
of
substantial
ideas
D
a
technique
that
my
middle-school
experience
had
made
me
familiar
with.
I
have
written
four
papers
in
the
scientific
style
for
a
Physics
course,
and
am
now
in
a
position
to
publish
as
the
primary
author
my
own
research
in
the
Department
of
Computer
Science.
My
creative
writing
has
also
been
deeply
influenced
by
the
scientific
style,
not
in
a
strict
formulaic
sense,
but
in
a
way
so
as
to
be
concise,
clear
and
yet
beautiful.
I
like
to
experiment
with
stripped-down,
bare
writing
as
opposed
to
an
intricate,
bloated
style
D
analogous
to
admiring
the
countryside
after
living
in
the
city.
I
have
been
influenced
by
conversational
novels
written
in
dialect,
like
Trainspotting,
which
speak
in
the
simplicity
of
everyday
language
and
deal
with
issues
completely
ignored
by
conventional
literature.
I
find
that
the
most
powerful
writing
is
the
kind
that
paints
emotional
landscapes,
where
every
sentence
has
something
meaningful
for
the
reader
to
assimilate.
I
have
seen
it
in
the
intricate
style
of
Edgar
Allen
Poe
as
well
as
in
the
crude
simplicity
of
Irvine
Welsh,
and
I
always
aspire
to
bring
that
kind
of
magnitude
in
mood,
setting
and
tempo
to
anything
creative
I
write.
College
writing
has
introduced
another
facet
of
writing
to
me.
ORepresenting
the
OtherO
had
a
few
interesting
ideas
that
coincide
with
my
philosophy
of
writing,
namely
the
fact
that
one
should
try
to
understand
the
essence
of
what
is
trying
to
be
said
instead
of
developing
an
interpretation
based
on
how
it
is
being
said.
Of
course,
it
always
helps
if
the
writing
in
question
leaves
little
or
reasonable
doubt
as
to
its
intention,
but
often
one
has
to
consider
several
different
interpretations
before
reaching
a
conclusion.
I
use
this
as
a
tool
when
I
write
something
creative
D
if
the
reader
can
be
coerced
into
considering
several
different
plausible
interpretations,
then
each
reader
will
definitely
take
away
something
different
from
it.
A
consequence
of
this
approach
is
that
it
narrows
the
appeal
of
the
writing,
much
like
an
art
movie
released
by
Hollywood,
but
is
much
more
personally
satisfying.
I
find
the
personal
fulfillment
in
my
writing
today
that
I
had
felt
was
missing
for
several
years.
Creative
writing
has
always
been
the
genre
of
choice
for
me,
and
my
freshman
year
saw
the
first
creative
work
I
had
produced
in
several
years.
IOm
now
in
a
state
of
mind
where
I
can
fully
appreciate
the
power
of
good,
emotive
writing
and
strive
to
improve
my
style
in
that
direction.
