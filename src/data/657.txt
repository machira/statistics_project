The
significance
of
writing
in
my
life
is
constantly
evolving.
Writing
can
be
both
a
joy
and
a
chore,
a
confession
and
a
choreographed
performance,
a
means
of
rethinking
my
beliefs
and
an
opportunity
to
solidify
them.
In
reflecting
on
my
history
as
a
writer,
I
have
found
no
overwhelming
trend
or
pattern
that
defines
how
my
relationship
with
writing
has
developed
over
the
years.
What
follows,
then,
is
a
record
of
isolated
experiences
that
have,
in
various
and
sometimes
conflicting
ways,
influenced
how
I
understand
and
approach
the
task
of
writing
as
a
college
student.
I
have
few
crisp
memories
of
my
experiences
with
writing
before
fourth
or
fifth
grade.
All
that
remains
of
my
earliest
writing
is
a
scrap
of
orange
construction
paper
covered
with
wild
letters,
which
reads
NMY
CAT
IS
NICE.
MY
CAT
IS
SWEET.
AND
SHE
LOVES
TO
EAT.O
The
date
on
the
note
indicates
that
I
wrote
this
as
a
six-year-old,
when
a
pencil
still
probably
felt
like
some
strange
extension
of
my
hand
that
wouldnOt
move
exactly
where
I
wanted
it.
Writing
as
an
elementary
school
student
was
constantly
interrupted
by
the
confusions
of
spelling,
the
worry
of
punctuation,
and
the
struggle
to
keep
my
letters
small
enough
to
fit
between
the
lines
on
loose-leaf
paper.
According
to
my
mom,
writing
frustrated
me
in
first
grade
because
I
couldnOt
form
letters
as
perfect
as
those
in
the
alphabet
poster
that
hung
along
the
chalkboard.
The
physical
difficulty
of
writing
was
discouraging
and,
for
a
few
years,
prevented
me
from
understanding
writing
as
anything
more
than
a
scholastic
chore.
My
first
memory
of
feeling
excited
and
joyful
about
writing
takes
place
during
fifth
grade.
An
avid
fan
of
Shel
Silverstein,
I
decided
to
imitate
him
and
wrote
a
silly,
rhyming
poem
about
the
origin
of
Superman.
When
I
found
lines
that
both
rhymed
and
continued
the
story,
I
felt
so
exhilarated
that
I
ran
outside
to
read
them
to
my
mom,
who
was
full
of
praise
and
encouragement.
Though
I
did
not
write
the
poem
for
school,
I
later
recited
it
to
my
class
for
a
public
speaking
project.
The
positive
feedback
I
received
there
drove
me
to
write
more
poetry
to
give
to
my
family
members
on
birthdays
and
holidays.
Writing
poetry
offered
my
fifth-grade
ego
a
way
to
feel
special
and
talented,
as
well
as
a
sense
of
identity
as
a
writer.
I
took
an
intrinsic
pleasure
in
writing
poetry
because
it
made
me
feel
powerful,
in
the
sense
that
I
could
find
words
to
express
almost
anything
I
imagined.
As
a
shy
person,
moreover,
reciting
my
work
to
others
represented
the
optimal
form
of
communication
because
I
could
plan
and
control
exactly
what
I
was
going
to
say,
unlike
in
regular
conversation.
Writing
the
Superman
poem,
then,
marked
my
discovery
of
some
of
the
personal
benefits
that
writing
could
offer
me.
I
continued
writing
poetry
through
ninth
grade,
the
year
when
my
teachers
introduced
me
to
the
kinds
of
academic
writing
I
would
be
required
to
produce
in
high
school.
While
I
enjoyed
composing
essays
for
history
and
English
classes,
I
dreaded
writing
dry,
formulaic
lab
reports
for
science.
I
disliked
making
predictions
and
recording
observations
as
if
I
were
a
scientist
performing
an
original
experiment,
when
often
I
would
already
know
the
outcome
of
the
experiment
and
which
principles
it
was
meant
to
demonstrate.
In
other
words,
I
felt
inauthentic
and
silly
in
mimicking
the
language
of
scientists
without
actually
doing
scientific
work.
Writing
essays
for
social
studies
and
English
came
more
easily
because,
whether
rightly
or
wrongly,
I
always
felt
like
I
was
saying
something
NnewO
or
at
least
Nmy
ownO
when
I
was
required
to
interpret
historical
or
literary
material.
Writing
essays
for
history
and
English
was
both
more
difficult
and
more
rewarding
than
writing
lab
reports.
In
the
former,
I
needed
to
generate
ideas,
but
in
the
latter,
I
merely
needed
to
describe
an
experiment
that
someone
else
had
imagined.
My
dislike
of
the
kind
of
writing
required
in
science
classes
contributed
to
my
decision
to
study
the
humanities
in
college.
During
high
school,
my
approach
to
writing
academic
essays
changed
considerably.
At
first,
I
conceptualized
an
essay
as
a
formula.
I
always
included
two
sentences
of
commentary,
for
example,
for
every
piece
of
concrete
evidence
I
presented.
My
conclusions
always
began
with
the
words
NoverallO
or
Nin
summary,O
and
I
strove
to
keep
my
paragraphs
within
the
five
to
seven
sentence
range.
The
key
to
a
great
essay,
I
believed,
was
following
a
set
of
formal
rules
that
would
guarantee
organization
and
clarity
of
thought.
In
eleventh
grade,
however,
an
English
teacher
encouraged
my
class
to
read
the
winning
submissions
to
an
essay
contest
at
Cornell
University.
I
was
surprised
and
a
little
offended
to
find
that
the
first-prize
essay
followed
none
of
my
sacred
rules.
Instead,
it
blended
narrative
with
academic
analysis
in
a
way
that
I
didnOt
realize
was
possible.
The
form
of
the
essay
elegantly
followed
the
shape
of
the
authorOs
thought.
Her
paragraphs
ended
when
she
had
finished
discussing
an
idea,
not
after
a
certain
number
of
sentences.
The
logic
of
her
analysis
was
evident
even
in
the
absence
of
my
favorite
sign-post
words
like
Nfor
instanceO
and
Nfirst
of
all.O
During
later
assignments,
when
I
attempted
to
imitate
this
authorOs
free-flowing
style,
I
abandoned
my
essay-writing
formula
and
felt
relieved
when
I
could
still
coherently
express
my
ideas.
My
writing
sounded
less
stilted
and
repetitive
when
I
did
not
obsess
over
its
organization.
As
I
began
to
understand
the
essay
as
more
of
a
record
of
reflection,
and
less
as
a
formula,
I
found
a
voice
and
tone
that
felt
more
natural
to
me.
At
the
same
time
that
I
outgrew
my
essay-writing
formula,
I
also
began
using
the
computer
during
every
stage
of
the
writing
process.
With
a
pencil
and
paper,
I
had
limited
ability
to
experiment
with
sentence
order
and
word
combination,
since
it
would
take
so
long
to
erase
and
rewrite
a
sentence.
The
computer,
however,
made
brainstorming,
structuring,
and
editing
essays
easier
by
allowing
me
to
rearrange
text
on
a
page
within
seconds.
As
a
terribly
slow
writer
who
spends
five
minutes
thinking
for
every
one
minute
writing,
computers
made
it
possible
for
me
to
meet
paper
deadlines
in
high
school.
Even
as
the
computer
facilitated
the
writing
process,
I
still
struggled
with
several
aspects
of
the
academic
essay.
First,
I
often
found
myself
arguing
for
positions
that
I
partially
disagreed
with,
asserting
opinions
that
I
did
not
entirely
believe.
Once,
in
psychology
class,
we
were
asked
to
respond
to
an
ethically
questionable
experiment
involving
animals.
I
argued
for
the
moral
acceptability
of
the
experiment,
even
though
a
part
of
me
felt
it
to
be
reprehensible.
The
cause
of
this
strange
behavior,
I
came
to
realize,
was
the
difficulty
of
writing
a
thesis
statement
that
concisely
captures
a
nuanced
position.
I
did
not
know
how
to
convert
my
cloudy,
indecisive
feelings
about
the
experiment,
and
many
other
issues,
into
brief
theses
that
asserted
more
than
NItOs
complicated.O
Thus,
for
thesis-driven
essays,
I
would
defend
positions
that
misrepresented
my
beliefs
but
were
easier
to
articulate.
Writing
academic
essays
in
high
school
often
felt
like
exercises
in
impartial
argumentation,
even
when
they
were
not
intended
to
be.
I
also
struggled
greatly
with
writing
timed
essays
for
exams
and
standardized
tests.
During
one
history
final,
the
teacher
notified
us
that
half
the
time
remained
when
I
was
only
finishing
an
outline
of
my
response.
Panicked,
I
rushed
through
the
essay
in
the
remaining
half
and
finished
without
any
time
to
read
it
over.
Due
to
my
terrible
pacing,
I
did
not
accurately
demonstrate
my
writing
ability
or
my
knowledge
about
history.
I
left
out
relevant
examples
and
counterpoints
because
they
would
have
taken
too
long
to
explain.
My
conclusion
probably
sounded
trite
and
confused
because,
with
only
a
few
minutes
remaining,
I
was
scribbling
down
whatever
came
to
mind.
Because
of
such
experiences,
I
am
now
skeptical
of
using
timed
essays
as
a
measure
of
writing
or
critical
thinking
skills.
I
cannot
imagine
an
argument
that
would
support
the
idea
that
one
student
is
a
more
able
writer
than
another
because
it
takes
the
former
forty
minutes
to
produce
a
NgoodO
essay,
(whatever
that
might
mean),
while
it
takes
the
latter
two
hours.
Timed
essays
upset
me
in
high
school
because
I
felt
like
I
could
have
done
much
better
work
if
I
had
had
extra
time.
To
escape
from
some
of
the
pressures
of
academic
writing,
I
kept
a
journal
outside
of
school.
A
journal
entry
might
include
poetry,
stream-of-consciousness
writing,
quotations
from
speech
I
had
heard
during
the
day,
or
observations
on
what
I
had
been
reading.
Here,
I
enjoyed
the
freedom
to
be
wishy-washy
and
contradictory,
to
spell
words
wrong
and
repeat
myself.
When
I
read
the
essays
of
Michel
de
Montaigne,
I
felt
that
they
were
more
akin
to
my
journal
entries
than
the
academic
essays
required
in
school.
MontaigneOs
essays,
with
their
disorganization
and
personal
tone,
sounded
more
to
my
ear
like
reflections
in
a
diary
than
scholarly
essays
with
their
detached
authority
and
careful
structure.
When
I
wrote
extended
entries
in
my
journal,
I
tried
to
imitate
Montaigne
by
responding
to
substantive
issues
in
a
personal,
open-ended
way,
without
hiding
my
uncertainties
or
reliance
on
other
peopleOs
ideas.
Writing
journal
entries
was
refreshing
because
I
did
not
have
to
perform
for
an
academic
audience,
but
only
for
myself.
By
the
time
I
left
high
school,
I
had
written
journal
entries
and
poems,
research
papers
and
lab
reports,
literary
analyses
and
timed
essays
for
exams.
I
had
written
pieces
meant
to
persuade,
inform,
track
historical
changes,
tell
a
story,
and
synthesize
scholarly
opinions.
Thus,
when
I
arrived
at
Lafayette
College,
I
felt
prepared
to
meet
the
expectations
of
my
professors
in
FYS
and
Literary
Questions.
The
writing
assignments
I
encountered
as
a
first-year
student
were
comparable
to
those
IOd
grappled
with
in
AP
courses
during
high
school.
Despite
the
overall
smoothness
of
my
transition
into
college-level
writing,
though,
I
still
needed
to
sharpen
my
time
management
skills
to
cope
with
the
quantity
of
work
I
received.
While
in
high
school,
I
had
the
luxury
of
teachers
who
would
not
only
require
us
to
begin
essays
early,
but
who
would
also
provide
careful
comments
on
the
various
stages
of
our
work.
At
Lafayette,
after
one
sleepless
night
finishing
my
first
paper
for
Literary
Questions,
I
realized
that
I
needed
to
start
my
essays
at
least
a
week
before
they
were
due.
I
also
found
that
breaking
an
essay
into
small
pieces,
by
writing
only
a
few
paragraphs
a
day,
made
writing
longer
papers
much
easier
and
less
stressful.
Aside
from
learning
the
importance
of
starting
papers
early,
I
had
little
trouble
transitioning
into
writing
at
the
college
level.
My
professors
at
Lafayette
have
responded
to
my
writing
in
strikingly
similar
ways,
sometimes
even
using
the
same
phrases
to
describe
its
strengths
and
weaknesses.
For
one,
professors
have
remarked
that
the
last
few
paragraphs
of
my
papers
are
less
developed
than
the
rest
of
my
essays.
They
are
certainly
right
in
this
regard
because,
in
the
desire
to
finish
a
paper,
I
often
carelessly
rush
through
its
ending
sections.
When
my
writing
goes
seriously
wrong,
according
to
my
professors,
it
is
usually
because
my
thesis
or
unifying
idea
is
either
lacking
or
inadequately
explained.
Again,
I
agree
with
these
comments
because
generating
clear
yet
complex
thesis
statements
has
always
been
challenging
for
me.
I
have
rarely
disagreed
with
professorsO
suggestions,
and
in
fact,
I
feel
that
I
have
a
strong
sense
of
the
weaknesses
of
a
paper
before
I
turn
it
in.
On
the
positive
side,
teachers
have
remarked
that
my
writing
is
logical,
detailed,
and
authoritative
in
tone.
I
have
noticed,
though,
that
I
only
receive
those
comments
on
essays
which
I
outline
beforehand.
The
sole
episode
in
which
I
have
felt
irked
with
someoneOs
response
to
my
writing
took
place
outside
academia.
Last
summer,
after
several
years
of
working
for
a
small
canoe
and
kayak
shop
based
near
Lake
Ontario,
my
employer
asked
me
to
write
a
series
of
small
articles
about
paddling
for
our
website.
Before
writing
the
articles,
I
would
sit
down
with
my
employer
and
discuss
the
specific
points
he
wanted
me
to
include.
I
felt
excited
and
honored
that
he
had
assigned
the
project
to
me.
However,
after
reviewing
the
rough
drafts
with
his
suggestions,
I
found
that
he
had
completely
rewritten
dozens
of
my
sentences
without
explanation.
When
asked,
he
replied
that
he
simply
thought
that
the
rewritten
sentences
sounded
better,
though
to
my
ear,
some
of
the
revisions
broke
the
flow
of
the
piece.
Between
delineating
the
content
of
the
articles
and
rewriting
almost
half
of
the
sentences,
my
employer
had
practically
written
the
articles
himself.
I
wished
that
he
had
initially
suggested
writing
the
pieces
together
or
had
at
least
let
me
know
that
he
wanted
to
use
my
writing
as
a
sketch.
Losing
creative
control
over
pieces
of
writing
I
believed
to
be
my
own
was
frustrating
and
humbling.
I
am
now
more
careful,
in
peer
review
sessions
for
my
classes,
to
remember
that
the
writing
that
I
review
does
not
belong
me,
that
editing
should
be
a
cooperative
effort
rather
than
the
imposition
of
the
editorOs
will
over
the
authorOs.
Today,
as
I
am
about
to
enter
my
junior
year
of
college,
I
feel
that
I
have
already
encountered
many
of
the
commonplace
difficulties
of
the
student
writer.
I
have
struggled
with
deadlines
and
thesis
statements,
with
an
overzealous
editor
and
the
challenge
of
finding
a
natural
tone
to
use
in
essays.
I
have
also
enjoyed
the
freedom
of
writing
purely
for
myself,
outside
an
academic
setting.
After
reflecting
on
my
history
as
a
writer,
I
am
now
more
conscious
of
how
environment
and
experience
may
shape
a
certain
approach
to
writing
over
a
long
period
of
time.
I
expect
that,
during
the
upcoming
semester,
I
will
be
a
more
patient
and
thoughtful
reader
of
other
peopleOs
writing.
