My
Literary
Narrative
Fall
2002
My
early
experiences
as
a
writer
were
more
creative
than
free
writing.
I
would
make
up
imaginative
people
with
imaginative
lives,
and
try
to
make
it
as
interesting
as
possible.
I
was
really
good
at
this
because
I
would
just
think
about
what
I
desired
most
in
life,
compare
it
to
my
present
situation,
and
make
an
interesting
transition
between
the
two.
I
think
it
was
my
ambitious
nature
coming
out
of
me
at
an
early
age
because
my
stories,
although
purely
fictional,
were
convincing.
It
was
with
these
ideas
that
I
developed
a
passionate
interest
in
English
literature
and
embarked
on
a
life
of
academic
writing.
Memories
of
primary
school
in
Harare,
Zimbabwe
are
very
vivid
for
me
because
those
years,
as
well
as
my
high
school,
shaped
the
person
I
am
today.
Primary
School
is
the
equivalent
to
Elementary
and
Middle
school
in
the
United
States.
Since
Zimbabwe
was
a
British
Colony
right
up
to
1980,
private
schools
were
set
up
in
the
British-style
system
and
our
teachers
all
had
a
European,
primarily
English,
background.
Although
I
was
in
Africa
and
spoke
the
local
language,
English
became
my
first
language
and
my
writing
was
influenced
as
such.
I
remember
receiving
my
"pen
license"
in
the
fourth
grade,
which
meant
that
my
handwriting
was
now
neat
enough
for
me
upgrade
from
a
pencil
to
a
pen.
That
was
a
high
point
in
most
fourth-graders'
lives!
From
the
Fifth
grade
right
up
until
the
Seventh
grade,
which
is
when
Primary
school
ends
for
us,
my
teachers
would
enter
me
in
our
Allied
Arts
Competition.
The
Allied
Arts
was
a
competition
with
different
categories,
which
included
creative
writing,
choirs,
and
any
musical
instruments
like
the
piano,
flute,
cello
etc.
I
was
entered
for
the
creative
writing
of
course,
since
I
am
not
very
musically
inclined.
The
competition
was
all
year
round,
so
once
your
teachers
felt
that
you
had
an
outstanding
writing
style,
any
good
piece
of
work
of
yours
would
be
entered
into
the
competition.
Our
essay
topics
in
class
were
centered
on
the
topics
in
the
competition
and
this
was
designed
so
that
even
if
you
were
not
normally
a
good
writer
but
wrote
a
good
piece
of
work
randomly
one
day,
you
would
be
automatically
entered
into
Allied
Arts.
The
thing
I
like
the
most
about
these
competitions
was
the
fact
that
we
gave
a
"nom
de
plume"
or
a
false
name
on
our
papers.
One
of
the
names
I
used
was
"Long
John
Silver"
and
why,
I'm
not
so
sure.
I
think
I
had
just
read
the
book.
They
had
four
types
of
certificates
you
could
receive;
the
honors,
the
first,
second
and
third
grade
certificates,
the
honors
being
the
highest.
I
think
I
received
the
honors
certificate
once,
a
couple
of
first
and
second
grades
and
numerous
third
grades.
The
judges
for
the
competition
were
really
strict
and
I
am
not
just
saying
this
because
they
gave
me
a
bunch
of
third
grades.
Just
receiving
a
certificate
was
excellent.
It
seemed
in
my
country
that
getting
an
"A"
was
really
hard
to
achieve.
Their
grading
techniques
were
very
strict.
High
school
however
was
a
different
ball
game
when
it
came
to
writing.
Grading
techniques
were
still
very
strict
and
back
home,
if
you
got
an
"E"
for
an
assignment,
it
was
still
a
pass.
That
was
the
lowest
grade
you
could
receive.
However,
my
writing
style
changed,
as
well
as
the
audience
I
was
writing
for.
At
school
we
worked
on
a
kind
of
dual
system
where
we
wrote
exams
for
two
sets
of
people.
We
wrote
an
English
Literature
exam
for
Zimbabwean
examiners,
then
we
wrote
exams
for
Cambridge
University.
This
was
the
same
in
all
subjects.
No
one
really
studied
for
the
local
exams,
particularly
English
because
for
the
examiners,
English
was
a
second
language.
Rumor
had
it
that
if
you
did
not
write
primitive
English
in
your
essays,
you
were
likely
to
fail.
This
was
a
rumor.
I'm
not
sure
how
far
true
that
was.
But
true
to
form,
I
wrote
very
basic
English
in
my
essays
and
I
managed
to
still
get
an
"A"
for
Literature.
There
was
no
in-depth
analysis
and
even
the
book
we
had
to
read
for
the
exam,
which
was
written
by
a
local
writer,
was
badly
written.
This
of
course
does
not
mean
that
all
writers
and
examiners
in
Zimbabwe
were
not
good
English
speakers.
This
was
just
the
mindset
of
a
lot
of
us
high
school
students
in
the
private
schools.
Then
there
was
Cambridge!
Now
the
Cambridge
exams
were
feared.
These
are
the
ones
that
really
counted
for
us
because
the
majority
of
us
wanted
to
study
abroad
for
college.
Only
certification
from
Cambridge
University
would
get
us
were
we
wanted
to
be.
The
early
years
of
high
school
was
not
creative
writing
anymore,
but
more
narrative
in
nature,
summaries
and
retelling
stories
but
outlining
important
issues
raised.
In
my
second
year
of
high
school,
we
studied
The
Merchant
of
Venice
but
not
to
the
same
depth
that
I
studied
Shakespeare
later
on
in
high
school
and
how
I
study
it
now.
With
The
Merchant
of
Venice,
we
discussed
Shylock's
emotions
with
his
famous
speech.
"Does
not
a
Jew
have
eyes,
ears,
nose...
if
you
prick
us
do
we
not
bleed?"
We
would
talk
about
the
thoughts
and
emotions
Shylock
experienced
in
this
speech
and
how
it
explains
his
behavior
in
the
rest
of
the
play.
So
in
this
way
of
writing,
we
discussed
the
general
"rules"
of
life,
and
the
consequences
of
the
decisions
one
makes,
in
a
more
generalized
way.
We
discussed
the
reasons
for
Shylock's
actions
and
the
punishment
he
received
in
the
end,
period.
It
never
usually
went
further
than
that.
I
was
not
very
enthusiastic
about
literature
at
this
point,
but
I
still
managed
to
do
well
enough
to
continue
with
it
to
an
advanced
level.
Now
Advanced
Level
English,
or
A
level
as
we
abbreviated
it,
was
like
a
bucket
of
ice
water
on
most
of
us.
It
was
both
challenging
and
exciting.
In
addition
to
this,
my
English
teacher
was
the
most
amazing
woman.
She
made
me
love
English
Literature.
I
had
always
been
good
at
Math,
but
after
I
had
this
woman
for
A
level
English,
I
hated
Math.
She
used
to
tell
us,
"Who
cares
about
finding
out
the
area
of
a
circle.
Its
more
interesting
to
learn
about
the
Wife
of
bath
and
her
five
husbands!"
She
taught
us
literary
criticism
and
how
to
analyze
literary
works
to
the
point
where
we
all
could
not
just
read
novels
for
enjoyment
anymore,
but
instead
we
found
ourselves
thinking
of
the
connotations
of
every
word!
Now,
my
writing
was
no
longer
fictional,
a
summary,
nor
a
generalized
statement
about
life.
It
became
more
personal.
My
writing
was
more
for
personal
growth
because
we
would
discuss
personal
reactions
to
different
things,
and
of
course
reactions
would
be
different
among
any
group
of
people.
For
example,
the
character
of
the
Wife
of
Bath
by
Jeffrey
Chaucer
was
an
amazing
woman
to
me,
because
she
was
very
open
about
her
sexuality
and
her
experiences
that
I
felt
one
could
not
help
but
love
her.
Others,
however,
found
her
too
open,
and
overbearing.
The
pictures
and
descriptions
the
Wife
of
Bath
gave
were
so
vivid,
especially
as
we
studied
the
tale
in
the
old
style
English.
Each
person
in
the
class
was
giving
their
opinions
based
on
their
personal
life
experiences.
Another
thought-provoking
book
we
studied
was
Women
in
Love
by
D.H.
Lawrence.
This
by
far
was
the
hardest
book
for
us
to
grasp
in
all
our
17
years.
A
lot
of
social
issues
were
brought
up
which
in
a
conservative
society
like
the
one
in
Zimbabwe,
we
otherwise
were
unable
to
discuss
-
for
example,
homosexuality.
In
Women
in
Love,
Lawrence
spoke
about
the
various
relationships
that
we
encounter
in
life
including
those
between
a
man
and
a
woman,
as
well
between
two
men
or
two
women
and
the
implications
of
these
relationships
on
society.
My
target
audience
had
changed
drastically
from
when
I
was
in
elementary
school.
Together
with
my
English
teacher,
being
the
very
open
woman
that
she
was,
we
all
learnt
to
be
open
about
our
own
thoughts
and
experiences,
good
or
bad.
I
began
writing
for
personal
growth.
From
analyzing
Lawrence's
idea
of
marriage
to
T.S.
Eliot's
ideas
about
society
and
social
convention,
I
began
analyzing
my
own
life
and
writing
became
an
outlet
for
my
personal
ideas
and
experiences
to
a
point
where
I
discovered
myself
and
established
my
being.
This
period
in
my
life
shaped
the
person
I
am
today.
Armed
with
this
incredible
knowledge
which
was
a
little
beyond
my
years,
I
embarked
on
the
Lafayette
experience.
I
came
with
a
sound
understanding
of
literary
criticism
and
believing
that
there
wasn't
much
more
I
could
learn.
It
was
only
in
my
junior
year
that
I
realized
I
was
wrong.
The
same
issues
were
raised
in
a
lot
of
my
courses
including
economics,
English
and
history,
but
with
a
totally
different
perspective.
In
many
cases
we
went
even
further
back
to
trace
the
roots
of
societal
patterns,
which
was
like
a
light
dawning
on
me.
One
amazing
thing
that
happened
to
me
in
my
junior
year
was
how
we
were
discussing
the
same
ideas
and
patterns
in
society,
at
around
about
the
same
time,
in
both
an
English
and
history
writing
course.
We
discussed
the
roots
of
the
term
"race"
and
traced
it
back
to
not
just
slavery,
but
back
to
Roman
and
Greek
times.
I
had
not
been
interested
in
a
lot
of
ancient
history
because
I
felt
it
didn't
affect
my
life.
However,
these
courses
made
me
realize
that
the
roots
of
civilization
not
only
affected
me,
but
also
affected
my
community
at
Lafayette
and
the
world
at
large.
My
writing
continues
to
be
for
personal
growth
and
development
but
now
I
get
the
even
bigger
picture.
It
is
not
just
about
personal
growth,
but
about
growth
and
development
as
a
community.
However,
for
one
to
make
an
impact
on
a
community,
whether
it
is
through
writing
or
singing
or
anything
else,
personal
growth
must
first
take
place.
In
D.H.
Lawrence's
words,
one
must
find
his
or
her
"otherness,"
that
inner
being
that
no
one
else
can
touch.
From
there
one
can
more
effectively
help
others
to
create
a
more
ideal
society
that
is
not
so
concerned
with
the
superficial
issues
of
life.
This
is
why
I
decided
I
wanted
to
be
a
Writing
Associate.
I
wanted
to
find
a
forum
where
I
could
share
my
writing
experiences
with
others
who
may
just
be
starting
to
find
their
academic
writing
style,
or
those
who
are
almost
there,
but
just
need
a
little
push
in
the
right
direction.
The
same
way
one
needs
to
be
more
open
in
life
as
far
as
speaking
one's
mind
to
create
better
communication,
one
must
write
more
effectively
and
openly
to
better
communicate
ideas.
My
writing
also
continues
to
be
a
discovery
to
a
lot
of
issues
I
had
decided
to
exclude
myself
from,
for
example
politics
or
religion.
Through
other
people's
writing
the
discovery
can
continue
to
make
me
a
better
listener,
reader
as
well
as
writer.
These
are
skills
that
one
needs
not
just
for
the
Writing
Associate
position,
or
any
other
position
on
Lafayette
campus.
These
are
skills
I
will
take
with
me
into
all
aspects
of
my
life
beyond
college.
