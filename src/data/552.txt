I
found
it
a
bit
difficult
to
sit
down
and
actually
write
this
paper,
it
wasnOt
easy
to
really
look
back
at
my
life
and
see
how
my
views
and
ideas
about
what
writing
is
and
what
it
should
be
were
formed.
My
earliest
writing
memory
is
from
when
I
was
three
years
old
when
my
mother
taught
me
how
to
write
my
name.
I
could
manage
to
remember
how
to
spell
and
easily
enough
but
I
think
it
was
a
few
years
before
I
could
finally
master
my
middle
name,
William.
Similar
experiences
seemed
to
characterize
my
time
at
Grammar
School.
I
never
had
a
problem
with
reading
or
grammar
for
the
most
part,
but
I
remember
it
was
always
difficult
for
me
to
learn
how
to
spell
new
words
and
I
often
had
COs
and
DOs
in
the
subject.
I
find
this
puzzling
because
I
was
always
considered
to
be
ahead
of
my
grade
when
it
came
to
reading
ability.
By
the
time
I
was
in
Middle
School
my
previous
grades
became
moot
as
my
spelling
had
finally
developed
enough
and
I
stopped
having
problems.
To
this
day
I
honestly
cannot
understand
why
I
had
such
a
problem
with
spelling
to
begin
with.
Probably
the
most
influential
experiences
for
my
development
as
a
writer
occurred
during
my
sophomore,
junior,
and
senior
years
of
High
School.
Those
were
the
first
years
that
I
really
began
to
read
the
books
and
study
the
subjects
that
have
given
me
both
my
foundation
as
a
writer
and
my
current
milieu.
When
I
was
in
High
School
the
writing
genres
I
exercised
the
most
were
DBQs,
FREs
and
general
responses
to
English
books
and
poems
I
had
read
and
Latin
texts
I
had
translated.
I
feel
that
my
English
classes
improved
my
writing
to
a
minimal
extent
and
that
I
learned
more
about
writing
and
grammar
in
my
Latin
and
History
Classes.
I
feel
they
have
given
me
an
excellent
foundation
in
writing
a
persuasive
paper
based
upon
textual
support.
My
experiences
in
both
History
and
Latin
were
quite
rigorous
and
although
at
the
time
they
were
often
more
than
a
little
stressful,
I
now
feel
that
they
had
greatly
improved
my
written
ability
to
express
myself.
My
History
teachers
would
always
force
my
classmates
and
I
to
Nmark
upO
our
primary
and
secondary
source
documents
so
that
when
we
wrote
our
final
papers
we
would
have
plenty
of
footnote
fodder.
Similarly,
my
Latin
teacher
would
often
encourage
the
same
attention
to
detail
and
my
class
was
often
assigned
essays
solely
over
the
grammatical
and
rhetorical
devices
used
by
the
author
we
were
translating.
Also,
It
certainly
was
not
uncommon
for
my
Latin
teacher
to
give
out
surprise
quizzes
in
which
we
were
given
a
text
we
had
never
seen
before
and
told
to
circle
all
the
examples
of
anaphoras,
polysyndetons,
ellipsisOs,
etc.
My
years
as
a
Latin
student
influenced
me
in
more
ways
than
I
can
possible
relate
here
and
I
even
wrote
my
College
Application
Essay
about
the
experiences
I
had
gained
from
translating
many
of
the
Western
WorldOs
greatest
classics
and
my
trips
to
Italy
and
Greece.
I
understand
that
many
people
today
feel
Latin
to
be
a
Ndead
languageO
but
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth.
To
this
day
I
still
consider
many
of
the
texts
I
have
translated
to
be
some
of
the
most
significant
and
beautiful
works
I
have
ever
read.
During
High
School
I
translated
at
least
a
dozen
of
the
Roman
Classics
including
Aeneis,
In
Catilinam,
De
Bello
Galico,
Metamorphoses,
Amores
and
many
others.
It
seemed
every
author
gave
something
incredibly
important
for
me
to
learn.
Virgil
wrote
about
the
very
nature
of
what
it
meant
to
be
a
Hero,
Cicero
exemplified
precise
logic
and
the
great
importance
of
the
moral
virtues
and
OvidOs
completely
mastery
of
the
Latin
language
showed
how
powerful
language
could
be
when
one
knew
how
to
properly
use
it.
Translating
and
writing
over
these
pieces
also
lead
me
to
see
writing
as
really
more
of
a
means
of
persuasion
than
anything
else.
The
idea
that
the
writing
process
was
something
that
should
facilitate
thought
and
problem
solving
was
not
encouraged
by
my
High
School
teachers.
One
was
only
supposed
to
actually
sit
down
and
begin
to
write
a
paper
when
one
knew
exactly
what
one
wanted
to
be
said
and
how
one
was
going
to
argue
it.
Also,
my
classmates
and
I
were
repeatedly
told
that
our
personal
opinions
were
close
to
meaningless
and
only
had
a
place
in
our
papers
if
we
had
textual
support
to
back
them
up.
I
think
that
was
some
of
the
best
advice
ever
given
to
me
on
the
subject
of
academic
writing.
There
was
constant
encouragement
for
myself
and
my
classmates
to
be
as
logical
as
we
could
possibly
be
and
concretely
support
everything
we
wrote.
The
views
I
gained
in
High
School
were
solidified
by
my
further
study
of
History
and
Political
Theory
when
I
came
to
Lafayette.
In
a
history
class
I
took
last
semester
I
noticed
just
how
important
my
High
School
teachersO
lessons
on
critical
thought
really
were.
In
the
class
I
was
assigned
to
read
the
work
of
Arthur
Schlesinger
describing
the
Jacksonian
era
and
a
rebuttal
essay
written
by
Charles
Sellers.
At
first
I
was
greatly
impressed
with
SchlesingerOs
writings
but
as
I
read
SchlesingerOs
essay,
but
later,
after
I
had
read
SellersO
essay,
I
came
to
believe
that
Schlesinger
really
was
not
as
credible
as
he
had
first
appeared.
The
fallacy
of
SchlesingerOs
work,
Sellers
declared,
was
hidden
by
the
talent
of
its
composition.
Upon
rereading
a
sizable
exert
of
SchlesingerOs
The
Age
of
Jackson
(concerning
the
destruction
of
the
Second
Bank
of
the
United
States)
I
came
to
agree
with
Sellers
and
noticed
many
similarities
between
SchlesingerOs
work
and
nearly
every
epic
I
had
ever
read.
Schlesinger
obviously
wanted
his
audience
to
see
conflict
between
the
pro
and
anti
Bank
members
of
Congress
as
an
archetypical
confrontation
between
good
and
evil.
Nicholas
Biddle
(the
president
of
the
Bank)
was
labeled
a
NmegalomaniacO
and
Nobviously
drunk
with
powerO
the
very
embodiment
of
oppression
and
tyranny.
BiddleOs
supporters
were
in
turn
described
as
self-interested
elitists
who
held
no
redeeming
qualities
whatsoever.
Andrew
Jackson
and
his
supporters
on
the
other
hand
could
do
no
wrong
and
any
mistakes
they
made
were
not
caused
by
ignorance
or
malevolence,
but
by
trickery
originating
from
the
Biddle
camp.
Similarly,
any
negative
personality
trait
expressed
by
a
Jacksonian
was
either
glossed
over
or
romanticized
as
merely
the
classic
hubris
held
by
all
heroes.
SchlesingerOs
work
truly
was
masterfully
prepared,
but
it
seems
he
was
overtaken
by
his
own
grandiose
ideas
over
the
era
and
unable
to
see
the
situation
for
what
it
logically
was.
The
facts
that
The
Age
of
Jackson
is
without
a
doubt
the
most
widely
read
and
quoted
work
dealing
with
the
Jacksonian
era
and
how
I
almost
took
what
Schlesinger
had
said
as
unquestionable,
only
reinforced
my
belief
in
the
idea
that
academic
writing
should
have
as
little
personal
opinion
as
possible.
That
being
said,
I
believe
my
High
School
and
College
experiences
gave
me
an
excellent
foundation
in
certain
kinds
of
writing
but
left
me
at
somewhat
of
a
loss
when
it
came
to
other
areas.
My
first
semester
English
Class
at
Lafayette
was
completely
different
from
any
experience
I
had
ever
had
before
in
writing.
We
focused
mainly
around
the
concept
of
New
Criticism
which
I
absolutely
hated
because
it
seemed
to
go
completely
against
what
I
had
been
taught
before.
I
found
the
idea
that
every
piece
of
media
could
exist
and
have
a
meaning
by
itself
without
a
historical
context
to
be
completely
absurd.
I
found
myself
trying
to
ignore
the
rules
of
New
Criticism
as
often
as
I
could.
When
I
was
expressly
forbidden
by
my
Professor
from
using
historical
contexts
in
my
essays
I
reverted
to
mainly
commenting
upon
the
grammar
used
and
the
sentence
structure
because
I
didnOt
feel
I
had
the
authority
to
do
any
more.
I
still
have
problems
with
New
Criticism
but
my
experience
with
it
has
significantly
altered
my
writing
style.
Before
college
I
would
only
write
two
drafts
for
every
essay.
Before
my
first
draft
I
would
brainstorm
everything
that
I
felt
needed
to
be
said,
arrange
it
into
a
coherent
structure
and
then
write
the
essay.
My
second
draft
was
usually
little
more
than
the
fixing
of
typos
and
grammatical
errors
that
I
had
overlooked
the
first
time.
About
half
way
through
my
first
English
Class
at
Lafayette
I
found
that
that
was
beginning
to
change.
My
grades
were
fine
so
I
in
no
way
felt
compelled
to
change,
but
I
did.
I
began
to
write
multiple
drafts
of
every
paper;
I
would
brainstorm
on
the
main
points
and
then
just
begin
to
write
and
see
where
my
ideas
took
themselves,
when
I
hit
upon
something
that
I
liked
I
kept
it
and
when
I
found
myself
locked
into
tangents
I
got
rid
of
them.
IOve
found
this
process
to
be
much
slower
than
my
previous
one,
but
when
given
enough
time
it
is
exceedingly
more
rewarding
and
always
more
interesting
although
it
is
not
always
easy
for
others
to
see.
Indeed
this
style
seems
to
be
more
easily
susceptible
to
having
problems
with
themes
and
fluency,
but
I
have
no
aversion
to
devoting
large
tracks
of
times
to
projects
and
this
style
allows
me
to
explore
so
many
other
ideas
than
my
previous
one.
After
reading
the
article
assigned
entitled
inventing
the
university
I
found
that
many
of
the
criticisms
it
made
regarding
modern
academia
to
be
true
in
the
sense
that
I
have
experienced
them
at
Lafayette
(though
mostly
in
my
larger
lecture
based
introductory
classes
such
as
psychology
and
economics)
where
professors
have
stated
there
is
only
one
correct
way
to
look
at
many
social
and
individual
phenomenon
even
though
many
of
there
viewpoints
are
considered
to
be
antiquated
by
other
fields
of
study
(some
of
these
intellectual
relics
have
been
considered
and
dismissed
by
other
fields
almost
a
century
ago).
Obviously,
some
field
is
hindering
the
progress
of
another
if
there
views
of
reality
are
actually
mutually
exclusive.
Another
prompt
question
I
feel
is
worth
responding
to
is
the
one
pertaining
to
my
worst
and
best
moments
as
a
writer.
I
really
cannot
say
what
my
worst
experience
was,
I
have
had
many
difficult
and
frustrating
papers
in
the
past
but
I
cannot
call
any
of
them
my
NworstO
as
I
have
learned
a
great
deal
from
them
all.
My
best
experiences
as
a
writer
have
definitely
come
in
my
past
year
of
study
at
Lafayette.
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
all
of
the
papers
I
have
written
here
due
to
the
interesting
material
they
were
based
upon.
Perhaps
my
two
favorite
papers
at
Lafayette
were
written
about
the
epic
Beowulf
and
American
society
during
the
Jacksonian
era.
I
previously
submitted
the
Beowulf
paper
to
the
College
Writing
Program
as
a
writing
sample.
I
enjoyed
the
paper
because
it
gave
endless
opportunities
to
research
the
time
in
which
the
Beowulf
Manuscript
was
written
and
examine
the
clashing
Pagan
and
Christian
ideologies
that
are
contained
within
it.
The
imagery
of
the
swords
in
Beowulf
as
well
as
the
Monsters
and
references
to
the
Christian
God/Pagan
gods
were
incredibly
interesting
and
it
was
an
excellent
example
of
the
diffusion
of
cultures
that
took
place
in
Northern
Europe
during
the
transition
from
banded
tribal
society
to
Christian
feudalism.
I
enjoyed
my
paper
on
Jacksonian
America,
I
believe,
because
it
was
the
first
serious
paper
I
had
written
as
College
level
history
student.
IOm
sure
other
people
would
find
this
tedious,
but
I
absolutely
loved
putting
in
footnotes
and
being
able
to
make
a
good
case
for
the
accuracy
of
the
views
I
had
on
the
era.
I
look
forward
to
my
upcoming
year
as
a
W.A.
I
hope
that
all
the
extra
work
gives
me
an
opportunity
to
enhance
my
abilities
as
a
writer
even
more.
After
college
I
am
considering
either
law
or
graduate
school
and
I
know
that
the
skills
that
I
will
gain
in
my
three
more
years
at
Lafayette
will
be
essential
to
my
having
any
chance
at
future
success.
I
look
forward
to
working
with
everyone
in
the
College
Writing
Program
in
the
fall.
