A
Writer's
Journey
8/16/98
For
as
long
as
I
can
remember,
writing
has
been
my
passion,
my
release,
and
my
comfort.
In
a
world
where
life
rushes
by
us
at
a
dizzying
pace,
it
is
necessary
to
slow
down
occasionally
and
to
reflect
upon
our
daily
events,
both
ordinary
and
extraordinary.
This
period
of
reflection
allows
us
to
critique
our
behaviors,
and
to
learn
from
our
pasts
as
well
as
to
recall
and
to
relive
the
joy
of
events
gone
by.
Writing
is
both
a
tool
which
puts
our
reflections
in
order
and
a
gift
which
allows
us
to
feel
our
experiences
more
deeply.
It
is
possible
to
look
back
upon
the
pieces
that
we
composed
when
we
were
younger
and
mirrored
within
our
growth
as
a
writer
is
our
maturation
as
a
person.
As
I
recall
my
personal
past
as
a
writer,
I
have
to
chuckle
because
my
initial
attempts
as
an
author
were
far
from
mature.
I
began
my
quest
as
a
writer
at
the
tender
and
naive
age
of
four,
in
the
backseat
of
the
family
station
wagon,
somewhere
between
home,
in
upstate
New
York,
and
Myrtle
Beach,
South
Carolina.
Bored
silly
by
the
monotony
of
the
car
ride,
I
was
badly
in
need
of
something,
anything
that
would
keep
me
occupied.
Like
any
smart
parents
who
want
to
maintain
their
sanity
on
a
long
car
ride
with
children,
my
mom
and
dad
had
brought
a
bag
of
travel
games
and
toys
to
entertain
my
brother
and
I.
Unfortunately,
the
many
miles
already
traveled
had
stolen
their
novelty,
and
I
needed
a
new
option.
As
I
stared
at
the
shiny
red
cover
of
a
notebook,
inspiration
struck
me.
I
would
write
a
story
like
the
ones
that
Mom
read
to
me
before
bed
each
night.
I
grabbed
a
pencil,
and
in
a
state
of
childhood
imagination,
the
tennis
brothers
were
bom.
In
my
childish
scrawl,
and
lacking
the
knowledge
of
punctuation
or
even
margins,
a
story
took
place
about
Joe
and
Fred,
two
tennis
playing
birds.
My
brother,
three
years
older
than
I,
and
several
school
lessons
wiser
assigned
himself
editor,
grabbing
my
notebook
every
few
minutes
to
insert
these
funny
little
marks
that
he
deemed
necessary.
Quotations,
or
something,
he
called
them.
A
few
illustrations
completed
my
story,
and
my
parents
praise
was
the
cause
for
many
a
sequel.
Finally
though,
I
outgrew
Joe
and
Fred
and
their
tales
became
nothing
more
than
a
mother's
keepsake,
some
childish
pages
squirreled
away
in
the
attic
with
Blankie
and
my
old
toys.
Little
did
I
know
that
those
crazy
birds,
a
product
of
an
overactive
and
bored
four
year
old
mind
had
begun
my
journey
as
a
writer.
Soon,
I
began
school,
and
with
formal
education,
my
printing
became
cursive,
and
I
figured
out
those
margins.
I
even
came
to
understand
the
usage
of
my
brother's
quotation
marks.
I
loved
creative
writing,
but
as
I
got
older,
I
tried
my
hand
at
different
genres.
My
best
friend
and
I
became
song
writers
and
formed
a
band
in
hopes
of
hitting
the
big
time
someday.
The
lyrics
weren't
terribly
wonderful,
nor
original,
but
second
graders
find
limitations
on
the
life
experiences
that
they
can
draw
upon
for
song
writing.
But
with
my
vocals,
and
her
instrumentals
on
a
keyboard
and
some
"drums"
that
were
actually
oatmeal
tins,
we
recorded
our
first
tape.
Unfortunately
seven
year
olds
have
a
short
attention
span,
and
I'm
sorry
to
say
that
our
band
succumbed
to
the
same
fate
as
the
Tennis
Brothers-
bigger
and
better
childhood
adventures.
Like
my
attempts
as
a
songwriter,
I
found
out
pretty
quickly
that
I
wouldn't
be
a
famous
poet
either.
My
elementary
teachers
always
seemed
to
enjoy
my
story
writing,
and
my
reports
always
earned
me
A's,
but
when
I
reached
fifth
grade
and
had
to
write
poems
and
hiakus,
I
met
my
downfall.
The
notion
of
poetry
just
didn't
make
sense
to
me.
I
had
always
used
words
to
describe
how
I
was
feeling
and
what
I
was
thinking.
Poets
seemed
to
use
their
words
to
obscure
what
they
really
meant,
and
rhyming,
and
syllable
patterns
further
complicated
my
simplistic
method
of
putting
feelings
into
words.
Never
criticized
before,
I
became
frustrated
when
I
would
hand
my
poems
in
and
receive
a
half-smile
and
a
"you're
on
the
right
track"
when
I
had
spent
the
entire
night
racking
my
brain,
and
perfecting
my
piece.
But,
I
accepted
the
fact
that
I
was
poetically
challenged,
and
suffered
through
the
poetry
studies.
I
always
emerged
with
a
few
low
grades,
and
a
bruised
ego,
but
with
the
excitement
of
knowing
that
soon
I
would
be
writing
the
way
that
I
wanted
to
again.
And,
there
was
nothing
that
I
enjoyed
more
than
writing
stories.
I
actually
got
excited
when
my
teachers
would
hand
out
a
writing
assignment
that
called
for
creativity,
or
allowed
me
to
recount
a
life
experience.
In
sixth
grade,
my
teacher
Mrs.
Rabideau,
gave
many
assignments
that
called
for
descriptive
writing,
which
quickly
became
my
passion.
Adjectives
fascinated
me,
and
I
loved
the
challenge
of
finding
just
the
right
one
to
make
my
words
come
to
life.
My
stories
were
often
an
extension
of
my
secret
dreams-
things
that
I
wished
for
but
knew
that
I
would
never
achieve.
I
loved
horses,
and
had
always
wanted
to
be
a
jockey.
Unfortunately,
by
sixth
grade
1
was
already
much
too
tall.
By
writing
a
story
about
a
young
girl
who
rode
horses,
I
could
put
myself
in
her
boots
and
feel
as
though
I
was
taking
the
reins
myself.
My
teacher
loved
these
stories,
and
would
take
my
finished
assignments
home
to
read
them
to
her
seven
year
old
son.
That
was
one
of
the
most
positive
reinforcements
that
I
could
receive
as
a
writer,
and
it
gave
me
confidence
as
I
moved
on
to
junior
high.
With
junior
high
came
the
start
of
adolescence.
That
not-so
wonderful
awkward
period
that
begins
in
seventh
grade
and
doesn't
seem
to
end
until
the
senior
year
in
high
school.
Suddenly,
the
comfortable
world
of
a
naive
child
becomes
marred
by
experiences
and
encounters
with
people
that
are
far
from
nice.
We
discover
that
the
opposite
sex
does
not
have
cooties
and
that
they're
actually
kind
of
cool
which
makes
life
much
more
difficult.
With
"love"
comes
awkwardness
and
any
misstep
seems
grounds
for
eternal
embarrassment
and
confinement
to
one's
room.
More
independence
gives
us
more
responsibility,
pressure
builds,
parent
and
child
clash,
and
our
worlds
turn
upside
down
for
a
good
five
years
until
we
figure
out
our
lives
and
get
comfortable
with
who
we
are.
In
these
years,
we
take
the
shape
of
the
people
that
we
will
be
for
the
rest
of
our
lives,
and
though
painful
sometimes,
our
experiences
give
us
plenty
of
material
to
write
about.
It
was
in
these
years
that
I
discovered
the
comfort
that
came
from
keeping
a
journal
and
free-writing
on
my
own.
When
my
world
seemed
to
be
falling
apart
from
some
great
tragedy
that
was
blown
out
of
proportion
by
my
young
mind,
I
could
spill
my
heart's
feelings
onto
a
notebook
page.
That
page
never
offered
advice,
but
it
never
told
my
secrets
or
made
fun
of
my
over
dramatic
flair
either.
It
became
the
keeper
of
my
deepest
thoughts,
my
crushes,
my
fears
and
my
victories,
and
through
its
pages,
I
sorted
my
feelings,
and
resolved
my
inner
conflicts.
Sometimes,
I
felt
as
though
I
would
burst
unless
I
got
home
to
spill
my
heart
to
my
journal,
and
when
I
came
away
from
writing,
I
always
felt
less
melancholy,
and
more
at
ease.
My
friends
were
wonderful
people,
and
we
were
very
close
but
I
was
a
quiet
and
private
person,
and
I
preferred
to
know
that
my
secrets
were
safe
in
my
journal,
well
hidden
under
my
mattress.
Keeping
that
journal
was
probably
my
most
formative
experience
as
a
writer.
At
the
time,
I
was
using
it
to
maintain
my
sanity,
but
looking
back,
it
taught
me
to
express
my
thoughts
on
paper,
and
to
find
the
magic
words
that
would
bring
my
feelings
to
life.
My
classwork
in
all
subjects
benefited,
and
1
couldn't
seem
to
get
enough
of
writing.
In
the
summer
before
eighth
grade
I
got
the
crazy
notion
that
I
would
write
a
novel.
So,
lacking
a
computer,
I
wrote
over
twenty
pages
front
and
back
about
a
carnival
romance.
After
dinner
each
night,
I
would
shut
myself
in
my
room
and
flop
on
my
bed
with
my
favorite
notebook
and
purple
pen
to
recount
the
tales
in
my
head.
It
was
solely
inspiration
that
drove
my
aching
hand.
Unfortunately,
my
inspiration
fizzled
out,
and
writer's
block
set
in.
To
this
day,
the
"novel"
remains
in
my
room
unfinished,
a
reminder
of
why
so
few
people
make
it
as
authors.
That
summer
ended
all
too
quickly,
and
the
freedom
of
youth
began
to
disappear.
Time
was
flying;
sports
and
schoolwork,
sleepovers
and
impromptu
mall
trips
with
giggling
friends
were
stealing
the
days
and
nights
from
the
weeks,
and
I
was
falling
subject
to
the
quickly
ticking
hands
of
time.
As
soon
as
I
grew
comfortable
with
junior
high,
it
was
time
to
move
on
to
high
school,
with
new
classes
and
a
new
building.
The
transition
was
pretty
smooth,
and
I
loved
my
freshman
English
class
and
instructor,
but
the
joy
was
short-lived.
I
had
never
encountered
much
criticism
as
a
writer,
and
hadn't
gotten
a
grade
lower
than
an
A
since
that
tragic
poetry
experience
in
fifth
grade.
But,
it
had
to
happen,
and
my
first
true
critic
came
in
10th
grade.
Overall,
that
was
a
bad
year
in
my
writing
career.
A
dry
and
unimaginative
English
teacher
required
us
to
write
book
reports
that
summarized
each
chapter
of
long
novels.
I
still
remember
typing
twenty
page
papers
on
our
obsolete
word
processor
and
feeling
as
though
I
would
scream
when
the
machine
wouldn't
print
properly
as
it
had
a
tendency
to
do.
Lying
behind
my
frustration
with
my
lack
of
a
computer
was
the
fact
that
those
assignments
were
not
the
type
of
writing
that
I
liked.
I
understood
that
there
would
be
assignments
that
I
wouldn't
enjoy,
but
every
assignment
in
this
class
seemed
to
bore
me
to
tears.
Summarizing
words
already
written
by
an
expert
left
little
room
for
creativity.
Further
sucking
the
fun
from
my
favorite
pastime
were
the
requirements
of
outlines
and
brainstorming
ideas.
I
wasn't
that
type
of
writer;
I
wrote
with
momentum
and
my
words
fell
into
place
as
I
got
caught
up
in
telling
a
story.
What
works
for
one
person
doesn't
necessarily
work
for
another
person
and
if
I
could
get
the
job
done
without
a
rigid
outline,
I
could
see
no
reason
to
waste
my
time
on
one.
Adding
to
my
dislikes,
my
teacher
required
group
work.
I'm
a
independent
person,
and
writing
is
very
hard
to
collaborate
on.
I
volunteered
to
do
most
of
the
writing
on
a
mock
newspaper
piece
about
a
story
that
we
read.
It
was
written
from
the
point
of
view
of
an
animal,
and
I
was
excited
to
finally
have
a
creative
project.
I
threw
my
heart
into
it,
and
was
proud
of
the
finished
product.
Unfortunately,
my
teammate
who
was
responsible
for
typing
the
paper
had
his
mother
"proof-read"
our
piece,
and
she
didn't
like
my
creative
flair
or
my
choice
of
words.
She
made
the
"corrections"
that
she
deemed
necessary
and
ended
up
rewriting
my
entire
piece.
I
was
both
offended
and
outraged
by
her
criticism.
To
my
amusement
though,
my
other
two
partners
liked
my
words
better
than
hers
and
demanded
that
my
version
be
handed
in.
It
was
and
we
got
a
98.
Nevertheless,
my
ego
was
bruised
and
I
came
away
with
the
promise
to
myself
to
never
criticize
another
kid's
work
and
to
always
encourage
rather
than
discourage
a
creative
Even
before
that
incident,
I
never
had
a
lot
of
confidence
in
my
writing
and
never
liked
to
share
it
with
anyone.
I
was
the
girl
in
the
back
of
the
classroom
who
never
raised
her
hand,
and
whose
heart
pounded
uncontrollably
if
she
had
to
read
out
loud.
I
wrote
from
my
heart,
and
my
words
were
very
personal.
I
feared
that
my
secret
dreams
and
feelings
were
apparent
to
my
readers,
leaving
my
private,
unconfident
demeanor
vulnerable
and
open
to
devastating
criticism.
By
eleventh
grade,
the
awkwardness
of
adolescence
was
beginning
to
end
and
my
confidence
was
building,
but
I
was
still
far
from
a
self-assured
person.
My
eleventh
grade
English
teacher,
Mr.
LaRocque
insisted
on
reading
my
papers
out
loud,
which
was
flattering,
but
uncomfortable
for
me-1
rarely
even
let
my
parents
read
my
writing,
and
a
classroom
of
teenagers
is
quite
a
bit
more
intimidating
than
my
own
flesh
and
blood.
However,
it
led
to
one
of
my
biggest
excitements
as
a
writer
and
as
a
person.
The
last
day
of
classes
was
a
sultry
June
day,
and
Mr.
LaRocque
was
reading
my
final
paper,
one
that
1
was
particularly
fond
of
and
had
spent
a
lot
of
time
on.
Though
the
heat
was
suffocating
and
we
were
sweating
and
uncomfortable,
the
class
seemed
enrapt
by
my
words.
When
he
finished
reading,
the
students
seemed
impressed,
and
one
student
suggested
that
I
submit
the
piece,
an
out
of
season
Christmas
story,
for
publication.
After
class,
Mr.
LaRocque
reiterated
this
idea
and
gave
me
the
address
for
the
21st
Century,
a
New
England
newspaper
that
publishes
student
works.
I
didn't
think
much
of
it,
and
was
busy
honing
my
basketball
skills
over
the
summer,
so
I
didn't
pursue
the
idea.
However,
at
the
end
of
the
summer,
1
had
some
free
time,
and
on
a
whim
decided
to
give
it
a
shot.
I
revised
the
story
with
that
horrible
word
processor,
and
sent
it
in.
When
I
didn't
hear
in
a
month,
I
put
it
into
the
back
of
my
mind,
hurt
by
the
fact
I
obviously
wasn't
good
enough
in
comparison
to
promising
young
authors
from
around
the
Northeast.
Then,
in
December
a
package
for
me
arrived.
My
heart
began
to
pound,
and
I
ripped
it
open.
It
contained
the
newspaper,
and
when
I
opened
it,
I
saw
my
name
and
my
story
in
print.
As
a
writer,
nothing
in
my
life
has
compared
to
that
moment.
I
was
on
top
of
the
world
for
days.
Mr.
LaRocque
will
always
hold
a
special
place
in
my
heart
because
of
his
undeterred
belief
in
my
abilities,
and
because
of
the
belief
that
I
gained
in
myself
from
being
published.
Seeing
my
name
and
my
words
in
print
was
the
single
most
incredible
experience
in
my
school
career
and
in
my
formation
as
a
young
writer.
There
was
no
turning
back
after
that,
and
I
was
a
driven
writer
with
the
newfound
asset
of
confidence.
Being
published
also
gave
me
a
newfound
work
ethic.
I
had
always
been
a
perfectionist,
but
now
I
felt
that
each
time
I
wrote
I
had
something
to
prove,
and
a
personal
standard
to
live
up
to.
Each
paper
had
to
be
better
than
the
last.
This
was
an
excellent
time
to
gain
this
attitude,
because
I
had
undertaken
a
college
writing
course
with
a
teacher
that
was
known
for
her
ruthless
grading.
My
friends
struggled,
but
I
excelled,
thankful
and
still
a
bit
bewildered
by
my
success.
The
course
was
a
lot
of
work,
but
it
was
work
that
I
enjoyed
and
therefore
didn't
mind
doing.
I
was
exposed
to
different
types
of
writing,
and
learned
to
enjoy
research
papers,
and
literary
critiques
in
addition
to
my
love
of
descriptive
pieces
and
personal
narratives.
I
learned
to
add
my
voice
to
even
the
driest
assignments,
which
kept
me
from
falling
subject
to
my
tenth
grade
slump
again.
All
of
my
papers
earned
A's
except
for
the
A-
on
my
poetry
critique,
and
the
biting
comment
from
my
teacher
saying
that
she
could
tell
that
I
wasn't
feeling
well,
because
it
wasn't
up
to
my
usual
standards.
I
was
sick,
but
I
didn't
tell
her
that
it
wasn't
my
health
that
had
adversely
affected
that
piece.
This
course
gave
me
confidence,
and
when
it
came
time
for
my
valedictorian
speech,
I
drew
upon
my
newfound
maturity
as
a
writer
to
express
my
sorrows,
hopes,
joys,
and
gratefulness
in
a
composition
that
left
me
in
the
vulnerable
position
that
I
used
to
fear.
I
read
it
to
my
family
first,
and
my
mother's
tears
assured
me
that
any
apprehensions
were
unfounded.
To
me,
one
of
the
best
compliments
to
an
author
is
if
her
words
touch
another
to
the
point
of
tears.
1
read
the
speech
at
graduation,
with
the
also
newfound
maturity
of
a
graduating
senior
that
has
finally
conquered
adolescence.
The
tears
of
my
classmates
and
their
parents
went
beyond
their
words
to
assure
me
of
my
success-
words
can
make
up
lies,
but
the
heart
can
not
hide
its
true
emotions
when
it
has
been
touched.
The
events
in
my
senior
year
gave
me
confidence
as
I
approached
Lafayette
and
my
FYS,
yet,
I
was
apprehensive
about
my
abilities
to
be
a
strong
college
writer.
I
had
heard
many
horror
stories
about
professors
that
didn't
give
A's
and
who
criticized
every
detail
of
papers.
My
dad
warned
me
several
times
before
I
left
that
I
would
inevitably
run
into
a
professor
that
didn't
like
my
writing,
and
who
would
give
me
poor
grades.
I
had
always
been
a
wordy
writer,
and
my
papers
always
exceeded
the
suggested
length
by
several
pages.
Dad
had
tried
to
teach
me
from
my
earliest
writing
endeavors
to
say
what
I
wanted
to
say
in
the
minimum
amount
of
words.
He
warned
that
college
professors
may
not
like
wordiness.
This
was
difficult
for
me
to
fix,
but
I
did
keep
it
in
mind
when
writing
my
first
FYS
paper.
Two
problems
plagued
my
initial
efforts
as
a
writer
at
Lafayette.
The
first
was
my
unanticipated
difficulty
adjusting
to
being
600
miles
from
my
beloved
family
and
wonderful
friends.
Focusing
on
anything
besides
the
pain
of
homesickness
in
my
heart,
and
apprehension
of
the
future
was
difficult.
The
second
problem
stemmed
from
the
fact
that
I
had
to
read
the
assignment
for
the
first
paper
about
twenty
times
before
I
had
some
semblance
of
understanding.
I
loved
my
biology
based
FYS,
and
its
thought-provoking
material
and
debates
were
perfect
for
writing
a
mature
and
educated
paper.
Unfortunately,
both
the
readings
that
the
paper
would
be
based
on,
and
the
assignment
seemed
to
be
written
in
another
language.
In
addition,
I
never
anticipated
how
little
time
that
I
would
actually
have
when
all
courses
and
the
necessity
for
as
much
of
a
social
life
as
possible
were
considered.
But,
I
slept
less,
ate
faster,
bonded
and
socialized
during
bizarre
and
impromptu
stress-releasing
breaks
that
kept
the
sanity
of
myself
and
my
newfound
friends,
and
escaped
to
the
basement
of
the
library
to
write
feverishly
by
the
buzzing
fluorescent
lights
that
became
all
toofamiliar
to
me.
I
started
and
restarted,
scribbled
out
paragraphs
and
crumpled
entire
pages
in
the
quest
for
perfection.
I
knew
that
this
was
an
all-important
first
impression,
and
this
knowledge
fueled
my
brain-tiring
efforts.
When
I
finally
typed
my
last
draft
on
my
roommate's
computer,
and
saved
it
I
was
relieved.
At
ten
o'clock,
I
brought
it
to
the
library
to
print,
and
discovered
to
my
horror
that
the
computers
were
not
compatible.
In
trying
to
convert
the
file,
I
lost
over
half
of
the
thirteen
page
paper.
My
dismay
was
threatening
to
become
insanity
since
I
had
revised
the
paper
on
the
computer
and
hadn't
written
much
down.
Plus,
my
roommate
had
a
psychology
lab
due
the
following
day,
and
needed
her
computer.
No
one
knew
how
to
retrieve
my
file,
and
my
disk
wouldn't
work
anywhere
else.
Again
I
cursed
my
technologically
challenged
mind.
Somehow,
the
paper
got
finished,
but
I
handed
it
in
with
little
confidence.
As
usual
it
was
a
good
three
pages
longer
than
the
maximum
suggested
length,
and
I
still
wasn't
sure
if
I
had
read
the
assignment
right.
My
dismay
increased
when
I
got
to
class
and
noticed
that
everyone
else's
paper
was
shorter
and
more
neatly
presented.
Actually,
by
that
time
I
was
just
glad
to
get
the
cursed
paper
away
from
me
and
to
move
on
with
my
life.
Unfortunately
my
fears
were
reinforced
a
week
later
when
my
professor
changed
his
lesson
plans
to
include
what
he
considered
a
much
needed
lesson
on
college
writing.
I
groaned
inwardly
when
he
said
that
the
papers
were
terrible,
and
we
needed
to
learn
how
to
write.
He
handed
out
samples
without
names
of
poor
writing
and
I
watched
person
after
person
blush,
knowing
that
it
was
their
piece.
I
was
frustrated
and
would
have
rather
died
than
return
to
the
paper
that
had
stolen
every
bit
of
my
free
time
and
some
of
my
sleeping
and
eating
time
as
well.
Right
before
class
ended
my
professor
handed
out
two
more
papers,
one
short,
and
one
long,
also
without
names
to
act
as
examples
of
what
he
wanted.
I
was
pleasantly
shocked
to
find
my
paper,
all
thirteen
pages
of
it,
staring
back
at
me.
Relief
set
in,
and
the
professor's
praise
of
my
style
fueled
my
confidence
and
made
me
work
harder
on
each
successive
paper.
For
the
first
time
ever,
I
had
full
confidence
in
my
abilities
as
a
writer.
My
FYS
eased
my
transition
to
college,
and
gave
me
much
needed
assurance.
I
refined
my
work
ethic,
and
my
professor's
constructive
criticism
and
praise
taught
me
what
was
good
about
my
writing,
and
what
needed
to
be
changed
to
make
me
a
better
college
writer.
Inevitably,
I
know
that
I
will
run
across
future
professors
that
will
dislike
my
voice
and
my
style,
but,
what
is
important
to
me
right
now
is
the
knowledge
that
I
have
grown
up
in
my
first
year
at
Lafayette-both
as
a
writer
and
as
a
person.
The
elementary
school
girl
in
the
back
of
the
classroom,
too
shy
to
raise
her
hand
has
become
a
confident
almost-adult,
much
in
the
same
way
that
the
Tennis
Brothers
have
given
way
to
thoughtful
pieces
about
survival
of
the
fittest
and
evolution.
Writing
is
still
my
passion,
and
I
still
need
to
write
that
novel
that
I've
been
trying
to
get
to,
but
for
now
I'm
content
to
continue
to
grow
as
a
Lafayette
writer.
I
know
that
the
years
to
come
will
bring
further
maturation
as
a
writer,
which
will
be
matched
by
the
further
maturation
of
a
young
adult.
