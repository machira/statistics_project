I
had
many
difficulties
in
writing
this
paper.
These
were
not
difficulties
resulting
from
lack
of
material,
misunderstanding
of
the
topic,
or
even
lack
of
motivation
to
write.
To
the
contrary,
I
had
a
surplus
of
memories
to
highlight
from
my
career
as
a
writer,
and
I
found
it
difficult
to
select
only
a
few
which
shaped
my
writing
style.
My
experiences
in
writing
have
given
me
a
strong
command
of
English
grammar
and
vocabulary
and
have
taught
me
to
write
as
a
confident,
informed
author.
My
writing
career
has
spanned
the
length
of
my
formal
education.
My
earliest
memory
of
writing
in
an
educational
sense
consists
of
learning
how
to
properly
construct
and
print
cursive
letters
and
numbers
on
generously
spaced
yellow
and
blue
lined
paper.
I
used
nothing
but
a
pencil
and
copied
the
forms
of
the
letters
from
a
printed
sheet
given
to
me
by
my
teacher.
I
do
not
remember
when
I
first
understood
the
notion
that
these
squiggly
lines
could
be
put
together
to
form
sounds
and
then
words.
I
also
remember,
shortly
after
learning
how
to
create
letters,
I
started
writing
books,
complete
with
binding,
brightly
colored
pages
and
artwork.
Some
were
written
on
plants
and
others
dealt
with
animals
and
people
and
all
manner
of
things
by
which
I
was
enthralled
as
a
child.
None
of
them
contained
any
real
ideas,
or
for
that
matter,
any
full
or
complete
sentences.
The
books
I
wrote
were
essentially
a
commentary
to
correspond
to
my
artistic
illustrations
and
provide
explanation
to
the
reader
of
what
they
were
seeing.
I
do
know,
however,
that
my
inspiration
to
write
books
came
from
hearing
stories
read
to
me
by
teachers
as
early
as
first
and
second
grade.
The
illustrations
were
the
most
basic
elements
of
these
books,
but
I
was
motivated
enough
to
create
my
own
pieces
of
literature.
As
I
moved
on
through
elementary
school,
I
learned
a
simple
fact:
math
is
hard
and
reading
is
easy
(which
is
a
feeling
I
still
hold
today).
I
was
convinced
I
was
so
good
at
reading
and
writing
that
the
teachers
would
love
anything
I
put
to
paper,
even
as
I
wrestled
with
my
math
homework
every
night.
My
first
story
attempt
was
met
with
a
smile
and
many,
many
corrections
by
my
fourth
grade
teacher,
prompting
me
to
reconsider
my
supposed
authorial
greatness,
if
only
for
a
little
while.
Fourth
grade
also
introduced
me
to
the
idea
of
a
piece
of
writing
based
on
actual
historical
and
scientific
facts
which
had
to
be
found
in
books,
copied
down,
and
then
translated
into
writing.
I
was
assigned
a
series
of
reports
dealing
with
the
history
of
New
Hampshire,
my
home
state
at
the
time,
and
many
of
its
historical
figures.
Instead
of
making
things
up,
I
had
to
go
to
a
library,
pick
up
a
book,
open
it,
read
it,
and
apply
information
to
my
writing.
It
was
quite
a
shock
for
a
fourth
grader,
unused
to
being
challenged
in
writing.
Each
report
covered
the
basic
information
of
the
assigned
topic
and
did
not
stray
from
boring
fundamentals,
but
it
was
enough
to
earn
a
good
grade.
Many
factors
outside
of
school
contributed
to
my
ease
in
writing
as
I
grew
up.
I
am
sure
my
love
of
reading
and
books
has
and
always
will
influence
my
ability
as
a
writer.
I
was
always
in
the
school
libraries,
finding
and
trying
out
new
novels
and
biographies
and
short
stories.
It
was
these
which
gave
me
ideas
for
styles
of
writing
which
I
stored
in
my
head
until
it
was
time
to
use
them.
Reading
also
improved
my
background
in
the
English
language.
My
vocabulary
and
spelling
ability
were
among
the
best
in
school.
I
was
always
a
strong
speller
which
enabled
me
to
write
faster
and
more
easily
than
many
of
my
peers.
In
seventh
grade,
I
sat
through
an
in-class
spelling
bee,
during
which
I
was
the
only
student
in
the
entire
seventh
grade
class
not
to
miss
a
word.
I
knew
I
was
good
at
spelling
but
tried
to
hide
this
fact,
for
fear
of
the
reputation
of
the
class
nerd
following
me
for
the
rest
of
junior
high.
I
also
had
kept
a
journal
since
fifth
grade,
one
which
I
still
keep
today,
in
which
I
recorded
daily
activities
and
events
at
school,
soccer,
baseball,
and
wherever
else
I
went.
These
journals
allowed
me
to
write
without
supervision
or
criticism
and
try
new
things
that
no
one
else
would
ever
read.
It
was
in
my
journals
that
I
started
writing
lyrics
to
songs
I
wanted
to
write.
The
freedom
of
confidentiality
also
allowed
me
to
be
comical,
creative,
and
satirical
in
my
writing
instead
of
using
only
the
monotonous
academic
writing
style
I
was
accustomed
to
in
school.
When
I
was
taught
to
Ngrab
the
attention
of
the
reader
in
the
first
lines
of
the
paper,O
I
thought
about
the
different
methods
of
writing
I
used
in
my
journals
and
attempted
to
incorporate
these
into
my
works.
My
first
real
challenge
as
a
writer
came
during
eighth
grade.
I
was
placed
in
the
advanced
eighth/ninth
grade
English
class
under
the
direction
of
my
first
real
English
teacher.
I
say
NrealO
English
teacher
because
she
was
the
first
who
was
truly
eccentric,
unpredictable,
and
open-minded
(not
to
mention
incredibly
terrifying).
The
first
day
of
class,
I
walked
in
not
knowing
what
to
expect
and
saw
a
small
woman
in
a
bright
colored
dress
sitting
behind
a
desk
covered
in
candles
and
incense.
I
sat
down
in
one
of
her
desks
arranged
in
a
circle,
which
I
later
found
out
is
the
way
it
is
done
in
many
Good
discussion
courses,
as
she
started
explaining
the
course
materials,
listing
a
series
of
impressive
titles
I
had
only
heard
of
but
pretended
to
be
familiar
with.
Lord
of
the
Flies,
The
Iliad,
Oedipus
Rex,
Antigone,
and
many
other
tragedies,
plays,
and
novels
were
covered
that
year.
Throughout,
I
received
lengthy
writing
assignments.
The
turning
point
of
the
year
came
when
the
class
was
assigned
a
piece
of
creative
writing
coupled
with
a
research
paper
requiring
quotes
from
different
texts
and
sources.
I
had
never
written
a
paper
utilizing
quotes
from
different
authors
as
a
foundation,
and
was
not
sure
if
it
was
really
allowed
in
the
real
world
of
academic
writing.
I
look
back
on
this
course
as
my
first
introduction
into
true
research
and
persuasive
argument
training,
and
I
am
lucky
to
have
had
it
so
early
in
my
academic
career.
High
school
came
next,
and
I
felt
very
prepared
for
the
challenges
placed
before
me
at
a
private,
Catholic
school
famed
for
its
stress
on
academic
excellence.
Freshman
honors
English
required
a
great
deal
of
reading,
and
an
even
greater
deal
of
writing.
Every
class
began
with
an
entry
into
a
writing
journal
dealing
with
a
certain,
informal
topic.
These
topics
ranged
from
the
simple,
such
as
NDescribe
your
dinnertime
conversation
from
last
night,O
to
the
complex:
NRelate
the
life
story
of
a
toothbrush.O
These
exercises
were
not
time
consuming
and
they
taught
me
how
to
accurately
and
effectively
relate
small
details
in
my
writing.
The
motto
of
my
teacher,
found
written
all
over
the
classroom,
was,
NSHOW,
DonOt
TELL.O
I
was
confused
by
this
statement,
especially
when
I
found
it
written
across
the
top
of
my
assignments,
with
arrows
pointing
to
different
passages.
This
is
how
I
learned
to
describe
using
adjectives
and
adverbs
instead
of
listing
what
I
thought
the
reader
should
know.
We
were
assigned
basic
research
papers
on
Shakespearian
texts,
creative
writing
in
which
we
had
to
produce
our
own
short
story,
and
our
first
introduction
to
the
art
of
thesis
writing.
This
skill
is
one
which
I
will
use
for
the
rest
of
my
writing
career.
The
idea
of
stating
a
concrete
idea,
then
using
the
remainder
of
the
paper
to
prove
this
idea,
was
revolutionary
for
me,
and
made
complete
sense.
It
was
easier
than
rambling
on
without
direction
for
five
pages.
As
I
progressed
farther
into
high
school
writing,
I
found
that
the
thesis
paper
was
a
basic
tenet
of
English
courses
everywhere.
Sophomore
year
was
another
monumental
year
in
my
writing
career.
Honors
English
was
taught
by
the
schoolOs
principal,
a
Jesuit
priest
who
taught
only
one
class
every
day.
Admittance
to
the
class
was
by
application
only,
and
success
prompted
a
feeling
of
accomplishment
as
an
elite
English
student.
This
class
was
like
none
other
I
have
ever
had.
The
first
day
set
the
tone
for
the
course,
as
the
teacher
asked
us
to
stand
and
without
talking,
arrange
ourselves
in
alphabetical
order
while
he
used
the
lavatory.
Upon
his
return,
we
were
correctly
placed
and
waiting
to
see
what
would
happen
next.
He
never
lost
our
attention.
We
covered
Shakespeare,
Frost,
and
Donne,
listened
to
Macbeth
on
tape
and
acted
out
the
best
scenes
ourselves,
and
memorized
poems
for
performance
in
front
of
the
class.
Writing
was
a
basic
element
of
any
good
studentOs
talents,
according
to
the
teacher,
and
as
such,
we
received
daily
assignments
for
one
page
reflections
on
a
variety
of
topics.
The
challenge
in
these
papers
was
not
finding
material
to
fill
the
page;
it
was
effectively
editing
down
the
material
you
wanted
to
use
so
that
your
work
did
not
spill
over
onto
a
second
page,
for
that
was
unacceptable.
We
also
received
a
longer
paper
assignment
in
addition
to
the
one
page
assignments
every
few
weeks
and
often
complained
about
the
amount
of
writing
we
had
to
do,
but
it
always
was
finished.
Our
motivation
lay
in
reading
the
teacherOs
often
hilarious
commentary
on
the
back
of
the
finished
paper,
giving
our
final
grade
and
his
reasons
for
grading
us
as
such.
Junior
year
proved
to
be
the
next
step
in
a
logical
progression
of
writing
styles.
I
grew
to
be
more
experimental
and
less
reliant
on
research
in
my
conclusions
and
ideas.
I
began
to
break
away
from
purely
academic
discourse
in
my
assignments,
having
a
teacher
who
was
willing
to
accept
different
writing
styles
and
formats.
My
teacher,
a
young
college
professor,
made
an
exception
to
her
refusal
to
teach
high
school
because
of
our
high
academic
standards.
In
her
class,
I
practiced
the
art
of
the
thesis
at
least
four
times
a
semester
and
became
very
skilled
at
writing
response
papers
to
broad
topics.
Her
grading
was
divided
into
content
and
grammar,
which
to
me,
are
the
two
basic
criteria
by
which
writing
should
be
judged.
If
one
was
poor,
you
lost
points,
but
you
were
still
given
credit
for
what
you
wrote
well.
I
learned
to
balance
my
writing,
employing
strict
grammatical
standards
to
check
my
sometimes
overused
tendency
to
include
unneeded
adjectives,
commas,
and
colloquialisms.
Formality
was
something
I
was
accustomed
to
employing
in
my
academic
writing,
but
also
something
from
which
I
strayed
on
occasion,
prompting
questioning
comments
from
my
teachers.
Once
I
found
I
could
use
different
word
structures
and
longer
compound
sentence
constructions
to
convey
my
meaning,
I
relied
less
and
less
on
informal
speech
and
grammar.
This
ability
to
create
stronger
sentence
formations
allowed
me
to
grow
as
a
writer
because
I
was
able
to
use
language
effectively
instead
of
inserting
unnecessary
words
and
clauses
into
my
sentences.
The
transition
to
college
writing
came
seamlessly
to
me
as
I
entered
Lafayette.
My
high
school
English
classes
had
challenged
me
to
the
point
of
being
able
to
navigate
through
a
college
writing
assignment,
find
the
important
and
necessary
elements
of
the
paper,
create
an
idea,
and
support
it
with
evidence
from
outside
sources
and
my
own
ideas.
The
biggest
shock
I
found
in
the
new
world
of
college
writing
was
not
the
difficulty
of
the
assignments
but
the
length.
In
high
school,
I
easily
wrote
five
to
seven
page
papers
on
one
topic,
but
my
first
lengthy
assignment
in
my
First
Year
Seminar
at
Lafayette
was
fifteen
pages.
Unlike
many
of
my
classmates,
I
did
not
complain
because
I
figured
that
assignments
of
this
length
were
inevitable.
After
all,
First
Year
Seminar
was
a
writing
course
and
I
had
heard
of
longer
assignments
than
fifteen
pages.
I
worked
on
my
assignment
for
a
few
weeks
in
advance
of
the
due
date
and
brought
it
to
my
Writing
Associate
for
my
first
meeting.
He
helped
me
make
changes
and
answered
my
questions
about
the
topic
of
the
paper.
I
worried
that
my
paper
jumped
around,
trying
to
cover
too
many
topics,
but
he
helped
me
fix
the
flow
and
direction
of
my
paragraphs.
My
initial
WA
meeting
addressed
many
of
the
concerns
I
had
about
the
program
and
my
expectations
for
my
WAOs
responsibilities
and
contribution
to
my
writing.
I
wrote
most
of
my
papers
in
high
school
without
assistance
from
an
outside
source
and
so
was
not
accustomed
to
receiving
criticism
and
input
from
another
person.
I
prepared
a
short
list
of
questions
and
concerns
about
my
paper
and
my
WA
and
I
addressed
each
one
during
the
meeting.
I
was
over-prepared
for
my
meeting,
but
all
my
concerns
were
taken
care
of
and
I
felt
confident
in
my
work.
I
handed
the
finished
assignment
in
to
my
professor
and
got
it
back
a
week
later
with
an
NA-N
at
the
top.
My
confidence
as
a
writer
is
a
result
of
starting
to
write
at
a
young
age
and
having
writing
outlets
other
than
academics.
My
journals
allowed
me
to
develop
a
narrative
style
starting
at
a
young
age,
which
translated
into
a
familiarity
with
different
writing
methods
and
approaches.
I
enjoy
the
freedom
afforded
to
me
through
writing
and
the
ability
to
be
truly
uncensored.
In
the
sometimes
limiting
academic
world
of
books
and
lectures,
writing
provides
an
opportunity
to
express
oneOs
own
ideas.
