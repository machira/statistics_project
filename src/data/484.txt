WA
Summer
Assignment:
Writing
as
a
WA
in
the
Last
Year
NAhh,
I
canOt
stand
this
anymore.
Can
you
listen
to
this
sentence
and
tell
me
if
you
understand
it?O
I
asked
my
math/economics-major
friend.
I
had
just
spent
about
ten
minutes
rereading
the
same
sentence,
trying
to
grasp
the
main
idea
and
then
trying
to
remember
the
rest
of
the
paper
I
had
already
reviewed.
And
I
still
didnOt
understand
it.
The
most
frustrating
part
of
all,
however,
was
that
I
wasnOt
sure
if
I
didnOt
understand
it
because
it
was
about
economics,
which
isnOt
exactly
my
forte,
or
if
it
was
because
the
sentence
wasnOt
clearly
written.
How
was
I
supposed
to
give
an
informed
opinion
about
a
paper
if
I
didnOt
understand
it?
After
my
first
few
conferences,
I
saw
that
it
was
actually
quite
easy.
If
I
didnOt
understand
the
topic,
it
was
usually
because
the
writer
didnOt
either.
For
that
one
particularly
difficult
paper,
this
was
obvious
in
the
first
ten
minutes
of
the
conference.
I
started
by
asking
how
the
writer
felt
about
the
paper
and
the
assignment
and
he
admitted
that
he
didnOt
understand
the
articles
he
had
to
summarize
for
the
paper.
Instead
of
breaking
the
work
down
and
integrating
it
into
his
own
analysis,
he
simply
paraphrased
or
quickly
skimmed
over
most
of
the
material.
To
work
through
this
and
try
to
make
his
paper
more
readable,
I
asked
him
to
orally
summarize,
to
me,
different
parts
of
the
paper
where
I
had
the
most
trouble
understanding
the
meaning.
When
he
couldnOt,
he
realized
that
he
needed
to
ask
his
professor
for
help
before
he
could
work
on
the
actual
writing.
The
conference
first
made
me
feel
relieved
because
I
realized
(though
it
took
me
a
few
more
conferences
similar
to
that
one
to
that
one
to
figure
it
out)
that
if
a
paper
is
well
written
and
clear,
the
average
reader
should
be
able
to
grasp
the
overall
meaning
regardless
of
oneOs
familiarity
with
the
subject.
Despite
some
of
the
studentsO
attempts
to
brush
off
my
suggestions
on
the
premise
that
I
couldnOt
understand
it
simply
because
I
was
a
sophomore
English
major,
I
knew
after
a
few
conferences
that
the
reason
was
that
it
was
either
not
well
written
or
that
they
were
covering
up
their
lack
of
substance
with
impressive
economics
terms
that
were
inconsequential
to
the
content.
My
initial
lack
of
comprehension
was
often
my
inability
to
spot
a
paper
that
covered
its
lack
of
substance
with
rambling,
but
impressive
words.
While
this
news
lessened
my
worries
about
my
abilities
as
a
writing
associate,
it
increased
my
worries
as
a
writer.
IOve
always
been
commended
for
my
writing
abilities,
but
IOve
always
privately
felt
that
it
was
not
really
true,
that
my
writing
was
sub
par,
and
that
perhaps
I
was
just
good
at
writing
lengthy
papers
that
sounded
better
than
they
actually
were.
My
semester
as
an
economics
writing
associate,
however,
showed
me
that
one
cannot
just
quickly
write
an
insubstantial
paper
and
expect
to
receive
a
good
grade.
Sometimes,
yes,
an
acceptable
one,
but
not
a
good
one.
I
realized
that
my
papers
that
were
lacking
substance
were
probably
much
more
obvious
than
I
thought.
These
papers
are
easy
to
spot:
theyOre
filled
with
big
words
that
donOt
carry
any
significance,
theyOre
repetitive,
and
theyOre
unoriginal.
This
discovery
was
not
a
comforting
one,
especially
the
first
semester
of
my
second
year.
At
the
time,
I
thought
I
was
going
to
be
an
English
major
so
in
order
to
get
my
credits
in
line,
I
took
two
English
classes
that
were
required,
but
that
did
interest
me.
Unsurprisingly,
I
found
them
to
be
two
of
the
most
difficult
classes
I
took.
The
work
was
not
necessarily
difficult
or
overwhelming,
but
every
time
I
had
to
write
a
paper,
it
was
torture.
IOve
never
had
problem
writing
papers
and
these
ones
were
only
about
seven
pages.
Yet,
because
I
often
didnOt
have
a
good
depth
of
knowledge
of
the
topics,
I
had
to
rely
on
repetition
to
increase
the
papersO
lengths.
Sure,
I
researched
the
papers,
discussed
my
problems
with
the
professors,
and
reread
the
material
to
write
the
papers,
but
I
wasnOt
fully
understanding
the
topics
and
I
just
couldnOt
seem
to
analyze
as
much
as
the
papers
required
me
to.
For
instance,
one
of
my
English
classes
assigned
a
paper
in
which
I
was
to
analyze
a
William
Blake
poem:
to
look
for
its
meaning,
how
I
discovered
it,
and
its
importance.
Poetry
has
always
been
my
least
favorite
aspect
of
English
courses
and
Blake,
with
his
Biblical
references
and
often
contradictory
images,
seemed
to
be
too
much
above
my
head.
Unlike
many
of
my
classmates,
I
did
not
seem
to
have
the
same
background
that
allowed
them
to
easily
spot
the
underlying
meaning
found
in
the
Biblical
references
D
I
usually
did
not
even
realize
the
pictures
or
words
were
allusions.
I
couldnOt
extend
my
one-page
classroom
notes
to
seven
typed
pages
and
I
somehow
could
not
find
any
meaning
unique
to
myself
that
would
make
my
paper
substantial.
After
attempting
one
draft
that
was
simply
a
strung-together
version
of
classroom
comments
I
remembered
and
superficial
analysis,
I
knew
I
couldnOt
pass
it
in,
even
for
a
first
draft.
I
kept
thinking
of
the
economics
paper
I
had
just
reviewed
and
how
glaringly
obvious
it
was
when
a
student
didnOt
understand
the
material
and
just
regurgitated
what
they
did
know
in
a
repetitive
manner,
which
is
exactly
what
my
paper
was.
Annoyed
at
this
knowledge,
I
knew
that
I
had
to
discuss
my
problems
with
my
professor
before
I
could
write
a
decent
and
original
paper
that
would
earn
a
good
grade.
Once
I
had
a
conversation
about
the
topic
and
was
able
to
really
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
poem,
my
paper
started
coming
together.
I
was
able
to
analyze
more,
seeing
how
different
aspect
of
the
poem,
such
as
the
references,
worked
to
enhance
the
overall
message.
My
experience
as
a
writing
associate
showed
me
that,
as
a
writer,
one
must
understand
the
material
in
order
to
intelligently
write
about
it
in
his/her
own
words;
impressive
words
are
not
enough
to
make
an
insightful
paper.
Aside
from
simply
understanding
a
topic,
however,
my
experience
taught
me
that
a
writer
who
also
feels
passionately
about
the
topic
will
write
a
much
better
and
a
much
more
interesting
paper,
which
encouraged
me
to
choose
topics
that
I
felt
passionately
about.
The
students
in
the
Shakespeare
class
I
was
assigned
to
second
semester
really
illustrated
this.
Many
of
the
essays
had
similar
ideas
for
the
topic
--
many
students
studied
the
same
scenes,
used
the
same
analysis,
and
proved
the
same
points
(some
of
them
said
that
the
teacher
discussed
each
topic
in
class
thoroughly
enough
that
they
did
not
need
their
own
original
criticism.)
Yet,
the
few
papers
that
were
different,
that
took
another
perspective
or
examined
a
different
aspect
of
the
plays,
stood
out
as
the
best.
Those
students
didnOt
just
read
the
play;
they
related
it
to
their
lives
and
treated
the
characters
and
plots
as
being
live
people
in
the
present
day.
Instead
of
summarizing
what
happened,
they
analyzed
the
events
D
how
each
came
to
occur
and
the
dynamics
of
the
scene.
One
particular
paper
that
was
written
by
a
fellow
writing
associate
showed
that
she
had
a
passion
for
her
topic.
She
obviously
had
her
own
ideas
about
the
play
and
while
talking
to
her
during
the
conference,
she
treated
the
topic
as
if
it
were
a
story
involving
her
friends
in
the
present
day.
She
was
relating
the
play
to
her
life
and
taking
her
professorOs
ideas
to
form
her
own
ones,
so
that
her
analysis
went
deeper
than
her
classmates.
By
getting
excited
about
her
work
and
talking
it
over,
she
was
able
to
write
a
much
more
interesting
and
individual
paper
about
Shakespeare
that
actually
made
me
want
to
read
the
play
after
finishing
her
analysis.
Teachers
always
tell
a
student
to
pick
a
topic
that
makes
them
feel
passionate,
but
I
never
thought
that
doing
so
would
make
a
noticeable
difference.
Reading
the
Shakespeare
papers
and
looking
at
my
own
work
that
year
showed
me
that
it
really
does
matter.
Some
students
were
able
to
write
a
good,
analytical
paper
without
feeling
passionate
about
the
topic,
but
it
usually
wasnOt
as
enjoyable
as
a
person
who
did
like
the
topic.
Aside
from
how
the
paper
reads,
I
found
that,
as
a
writer,
writing
is
more
enjoyable
and
easier
when
you
choose
a
topic
you
are
interested
in.
First
semester,
as
I
mentioned,
I
took
English
classes
that
I
was
not
interested
in
and
I
rarely
found
an
essay
in
those
classes
that
I
looked
forward
to
writing.
They
were
all
hard;
I
had
to
struggle
to
find
enough
information,
to
check
that
my
analysis
wasnOt
completely
off-base,
and
I
had
to
stretch
what
little
knowledge
I
had
to
meet
the
paper
length
requirements.
I
started
hating
writing
and
when
I
was
assigned
a
ten-page
paper
in
an
anthropology
class
about
the
significance
of
the
design
of
Kirby
Hall
of
Civil
Rights,
I
was
uninspired
since
I
had
no
interest
in
building
design.
The
research
was
actually
very
easy
to
find
at
the
school,
however,
and
the
more
I
read
about
the
building,
the
more
ideas
I
had
for
the
paper
and
the
more
strongly
I
felt
about
them.
Suddenly,
ten
pages
seemed
too
short
to
discuss
how
the
sex,
race,
and
class
of
the
statues,
portraits,
and
quotations
portrayed
the
prejudiced
view
the
donorsO
held
toward
how
the
country
should
be
governed.
After
spending
most
of
my
time
organizing
and
outlining
my
ideas,
I
wrote
the
paper
quickly
and
actually
went
over
the
page
limit.
I
felt
so
strongly
about
every
sentence
I
wrote,
knowing
that
my
analysis
made
sense
and
wanting
to
prove
that
my
ideas
were
well
founded
and
meaningful
that
I
knew
that
paper
was
a
strong
one
and
that
there
was
not
paragraph
that
was
superficial
or
unnecessary
to
my
argument.
When
I
passed
it
in
to
my
professor,
I
felt
good
about
my
writing
and
actually
enjoyed
the
process
of
writing
it;
I
realized
I
hadnOt
felt
that
way
with
any
of
my
English
classes
yet.
Second
semester
of
the
year,
I
was
considering
becoming
a
Psychology
major
so
I
took
a
few
of
those
classes
and
only
one
English
class.
As
soon
as
I
wrote
my
first
paper
for
my
social
psychology
class,
I
knew
I
made
the
right
decision.
I
felt
strongly
about
my
papers
in
psychology;
I
knew
what
I
was
talking
about
and
wanted
to
share
my
ideas.
With
my
one
English
class,
I
again
felt
lost,
trying
to
analyze
books
I
didnOt
feel
passionately
about
and
receiving
mediocre
grades
for
it.
In
psychology,
though,
I
understood
the
concepts
and
could
see
real-life
applications
of
them.
My
papers
were
all
about
analyzing
one
group
of
people
and
applying
the
concepts
we
had
discussed
in
class
to
them.
I
chose
my
family,
and,
while
it
was
difficult
at
first
to
objectively
analyze
them,
it
was
something
I
knew
inside
and
out.
I
enjoyed
looking
at
them
from
another
angle
and,
grasping
the
psychology
concepts,
liked
writing
about
something
I
knew.
The
papers
did
not
take
half
as
long
to
write
as
my
English
ones
and
always
turned
out
better.
Just
as
I
saw
in
the
economics
and
Shakespeare
classes,
if
the
writer
was
passionate
about
the
topic,
it
didnOt
just
make
for
a
better
paper,
it
also
made
for
an
easier
one
to
write.
Finding
topics
I
felt
strongly
about
also
helped
improve
other
areas
of
my
writing
that
I
was
struggling
with,
namely,
repetition
and
narrowing
down
topics.
Often
when
IOm
unsure
of
my
writing
or
my
clarity,
I
tend
to
be
repetitive,
often
writing
the
same
sentence
multiple
times,
but
wording
it
differently.
I
think
IOm
being
unclear
and
that
by
restating
what
I
said,
IOm
clarifying,
but
in
truth,
IOm
just
filling
up
space
and
making
the
paper
more
jumbled.
Having
a
better
knowledge
of
the
topic,
however,
does
help.
Since
I
know
what
IOm
writing
and
I
know
that
I
can
explain
it,
I
donOt
need
to
be
so
repetitive;
I
can
get
my
ideas
across
with
one
precise,
clearly
written
sentence.
The
professor
for
the
economics
class
for
which
I
was
a
writing
associate
insisted
on
concise
writing.
His
biggest
task
for
me
was
to
be
aware
of
long
sentences
or
repetitive
ideas.
Since
economics
is
a
scientific
way
of
writing,
he
wanted
it
to
be
as
clear
and
concise
as
possible.
As
a
wordy
writer
myself,
it
seemed
like
it
would
be
harder
than
it
was.
I
found
it
much
easier
to
spot
places
where
people
could
condense
their
writing;
I
just
had
trouble
helping
them
actually
condense
it.
Looking
at
other
peopleOs
work
objectively,
however,
and
helping
them
reduce
their
own
repetition
was
good
practice
for
looking
at
my
work
more
objectively.
I
found
it
easier
to
find
places
where
I
could
cut
down
my
explanations
or
where
I
didnOt
need
any,
but
it
was
almost
more
frustrating
because
then
I
had
to
actually
do
it.
With
time,
it
became
easier
and
I
notice
that
though
my
first
drafts
are
almost
always
wordy;
by
the
final
draft,
I
have
done
enough
revisions
that
my
paper
is
much
more
concise.
While
some
of
my
problem
with
repetition
is
that
I
did
not
have
enough
to
say
on
the
topic,
I
found
that
when
I
picked
topics
that
I
found
interesting
and
narrowed
them
down,
I
was
actually
more
concise.
Freshman
year
of
college,
I
still
had
the
high
school
mentality
that
ten-page
papers
were
long
and
that,
to
write
them,
I
would
have
to
pick
a
broad
topic.
This
just
made
for
broad,
superficial
papers
with
repetitive
explanations.
It
was
obvious
with
some
of
the
economics
students
that
they
though
the
same
way:
if
they
didnOt
understand
a
topic,
it
was
easier
to
choose
a
broad
one
and
leave
only
enough
space
to
skim
over
all
aspects
of
the
topic
to
fill
a
paper
instead
of
discussing
one
aspect
in
more
depth.
Yet,
the
papers
were
boring
and
uninformative.
It
was
the
papers
that
were
narrow,
such
as
one
that
only
discussed
the
usage
of
ATMs
and
whether
they
would
soon
be
outdated,
that
interested
me
and
were
in-depth
enough
to
make
the
reader
feel
as
though
they
actually
learned
something
and
that
the
writer
was
informed
enough
to
be
able
to
teach
you
about
the
topic.
It
was
the
difference
between
my
English
and
my
psychology
papers:
I
felt
too
insecure
about
my
knowledge
to
write
enough
substance
in
my
English
papers,
but
I
narrowed
my
Psychology
topics
down
so
that
I
could
more
fully
discuss
the
aspects
that
interested
me
most,
making
my
papers
more
interesting
and
informative.
With
my
family
group
paper
in
psychology,
I
chose
to
only
look
at
the
function
each
family
member
serves,
allowing
me
to
more
objectively
and
fully
look
at
the
role
of
each
person
and
bring
my
outside
knowledge
together
with
my
textbook
teachings.
My
passion
for
the
subject
allowed
me
to
narrow
it
down
and
discuss
it
more
fully
without
resorting
to
repetition
or
superficial
analysis.
While
I
would
probably
have
figured
these
writing
strategies
out
on
my
own,
being
a
writing
associate
made
them
more
obvious
to
me
since
I
could
look
at
other
work
objectively
and
not
be
influenced
by
my
subjectivity.
Until
this
year
as
a
writing
associate,
all
my
writing
history
has
been
formed
by
my
own
writing
experience.
This
year,
however,
my
writing
has
changed
not
just
because
of
my
experience,
but
othersO
experiences.
Looking
at
other
peopleOs
work
has
allowed
me
to
see
the
different
styles
and
struggles
of
different
writers,
helping
me
more
objectively
identify
my
own
struggles
and
weaknesses.
It
is
almost
more
frustrating
because
I
can
more
easily
pick
out
the
places
in
my
paper
where
I
need
to
work
more,
but
I
still
struggle
with
how
to
improve
them.
Seeing
other
studentsO
strategies,
which
I
would
never
had
thought
of,
does
help.
Reading
different
styles
of
writing,
such
as
scientific
versus
non-scientific,
also
helps
me
combine
the
two
and
to
see
the
advantages
of
each,
applying
both
to
my
own
writing.
By
reviewing
othersO
work
and
more
objectively
looking
at
my
own,
I
was
able
to
work
on
my
own
weaknesses
and
become
a
stronger
writer.
