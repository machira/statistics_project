Returning
WA
Narrative
The
past
academic
year
and
summer
introduced
new
challenges
to
myself
as
a
writer.
I
found
myself
writing
screenplays
and
revisiting
poetry
only
to
discover
I
prefer
short
stories
to
either
medium.
I
bounced
ideas
off
of
professors
and
friends.
I
reached
out
to
more
seasoned
writers
at
Lafayette.
I
wrote
press
releases
and
media
advisories
for
my
public
relations
internship,
and
articles
upon
articles
for
the
newspaper.
I
became
discouraged
as
a
journalist
but
found
myself
continually
loving
journalistic
writing
and
wanting
to
heighten
my
abilities
in
that
area.
I
determined
that
I
wanted
to
write
an
honors
thesis
composed
entirely
of
creative
writing.
I
helped
a
friend
by
offering
suggestions
on
rough
NdoodlesO
of
his
poetry.
I
found
my
own
creative
process,
got
stuck
with
writersO
block,
and
inched
my
way
out
of
it.
I
changed
my
mind,
several
times,
about
what
I
wanted
to
write.
I
read
about
writing
and
learned
to
not
be
afraid
of
my
own.
I
began
to
feel
comfortable,
not
just
as
academic
writer,
but
a
creative
one,
whatever
form
it
may
take.
ThatOs
just
the
long
story
short.
Last
year,
I
wrote
about
learning
to
challenge
rules,
but
I
have
since
learned
to
return
to
them.
Rules
can
offer
structure
when
you
need
it
or
a
starting
point
to
jump
from.
For
example,
in
journalism,
the
lede
of
a
story
is
its
first
few
sentences
that
tell
the
who,
what,
where,
when,
why,
and
how
in
the,
most
concise,
most
interesting
way
possible.
ItOs
hard
to
be
creative
when
you
have
a
structure
to
stick
to,
but
without
that
lede,
the
rest
of
your
story
can
fall
apart.
It
reminds
me
of
writing
a
NthesisO
(or
even,
in
my
experience,
not
writing
one)
that
you
can
base
your
paper
around
or
the
main
plot
of
a
screenplay
with
the
rise,
the
climax,
and
the
fall.
Rules
can
be
especially
important
when
it
comes
to
public
relations.
Numerous
articles
reference
lists
of
them
for
how
to
navigate
the
PR
world.
Whether
it
is
interacting
with
clients
or
writing
a
press
release,
thereOs
a
certain
way
to
do
it
right.
Although
I
worked
with
public
relations
as
an
intern
on
campus
last
year,
I
had
not
necessarily
had
the
experience
necessary
or
the
mentors
necessary
to
help
me
write
better.
I
needed
someone
to
sit
down
with
me
and
discuss
the
writing
process,
how
to
structure
things,
what
kind
of
language
to
use.
I
needed
this
to
be
able
to
later
sit
down
and
edit
on
my
own
before
handing
things
to
supervisors.
It
is
this
same
approach
that
we
take
as
Writing
Associates
at
Lafayette.
Having
someone
talk
with
you
about
your
strengths
and
weaknesses,
whether
it
is
your
overall
evaluation
or
on
a
specific
topic
like
writing,
is
helpful.
When
you
know
your
strengths,
you
can
feel
proud
of
them,
to
know
you
did
something
well.
Knowing
your
weaknesses
means
you
can
improve.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
is
much
like
a
creative
writing
workshop.
You
read
someoneOs
story,
poem
or
screenplay
and
begin
analyzing
it
from
whatever
angle
is
the
most
important.
To
a
Writing
Associate,
this
means
categorizing
things
into
higher
order
and
lower
order
concerns.
Higher
order
concerns
would
include
organization,
whether
the
assignment
is
met,
whether
the
thoughts
are
clear
and
make
sense.
Lower
order
concerns
are
usually
referred
to
as
grammar.
You
can
direct
a
student
to
the
St.
MartinOs
Handbook,
but
you
canOt
force
them
to
realize
that
this
one
paragraph
on
page
three
makes
no
sense
whatsoever.
ThatOs
something
they
have
to
learn
on
their
ownNwith
your
help.
I
was
having
a
conversation
with
a
friendOs
little
sister,
Julia,
who
recently
graduated
high
school.
Her
mother
was
discussing
the
English
course
that
Julia
would
be
taking
in
the
fall,
mentioning
that
she
needs
help
with
paper
writing.
I
was
about
to
comment
that
helping
freshmen/college
students
with
their
papers
was
exactly
what
my
job
entailed
at
college
when
the
mother
continued,
NYou
can
have
great
ideas,
but
if
you
donOt
have
someone
to
edit
it
for
you,
to
put
in
those
little
commas
and
trim
down
the
run-ons,
it
wonOt
be
a
good
paper.O
With
all
the
training
we
have
as
Writing
Associates,
I
was
shocked.
Yes,
grammar
is
important.
Yes,
having
good
ideas
is
important.
I
was
led
to
believe,
however,
that
being
able
to
place
those
ideas
into
a
coherent
paper,
grammatically
correct
or
incorrect,
was
pivotal.
Unfortunately,
her
motherOs
idea
of
an
English
major
is
rooted
in
the
belief
that
I
can
read
a
paper
and
only
offer
grammatical
comments
and
help.
Last
fall
was
the
first
time
that
I
was
assigned
a
class
as
a
Writing
Associate.
I
worked
with
an
FYS
involving
the
combination
of
literature,
film
and
psychology.
The
students
had
not
necessarily
signed
up
for
the
course.
It
had
not
been
on
the
original
list
of
FYS
classes
and
most
students
were
beginning
engineering
or
science
students
(not
psychology
majors,
however)
that
detested
reading
for
long
periods
of
time
and
writing
papers.
It
was
in
this
class
that
I
encountered
two
types
of
student
with
which
I
had
no
previous
experienceNthe
non-writer
and
the
obsessive-writer.
While
the
majority
of
the
class
fell
into
the
NaverageO
student
area
(I
say
average
with
regards
to
how
they
approached
writing
and
the
way
they
worked
with
me
as
a
Writing
Associate),
two
students
were
very
much
outside
of
that
type.
Most
of
the
papers
were
what
you
would
expect,
including
a
range
of
writing
skills.
One
girlOs
paper,
however,
stood
out.
Her
introduction
was
creative
writing;
she
had
no
clear
argument;
the
paperOs
organization
was
jumpy;
and
by
the
end
of
reading,
I
had
no
idea
where
she
was
going
with
the
paper.
When
I
sat
down
and
spoke
to
her
about
her
paper,
she
informed
me
that
she
had
never
written
an
essay
before.
She
was
an
international
student,
but
I
had
assumed
that
most
students
at
Lafayette
had
written
an
essay
at
some
point
in
time
in
their
lives.
This
particular
girl,
however,
had
not.
I
struggled
through
the
conference,
helping
her
as
much
as
I
could
in
a
half
hour.
After
the
papers
had
been
graded
and
handed
back
to
the
students,
I
spoke
with
the
professor
who
expressed
concern
over
the
student.
I
told
him
what
she
had
told
me,
but
his
approach
was
that
she
should
know
how
to
write
an
essay
by
now.
The
next
time
we
sat
down
with
another
essayNin
the
same
vein
as
the
lastNI
spent
the
first
ten
minutes
giving
her
a
brief
introduction
to
the
high-school-taught
five-paragraph
essay.
Introduction,
Supporting
Paragraphs,
Conclusion.
Her
next
essay
improved
dramatically
(to
me,
at
least)
in
terms
of
organization.
Later
on,
my
Writing
Associate
staff
meeting
read
an
article
about
the
five-paragraph
essay,
comparing
it
to
a
frog
dissection
in
Biology
101.
You
have
to
be
able
to
successfully
dissect
a
frog
before
you
can
go
into
another
human
being.
As
a
writer,
the
article
suggests,
you
should
be
able
to
write
a
five-paragraph
essay
before
moving
away
from
that
structure.
In
this
case,
knowledge
of
the
five-paragraph
essay
would
have
been
especially
helpful
to
the
student.
I
saw
her
again
in
the
spring
when
she
came
for
drop-in
(an
opportunity
I
pushed
students
to
take
and
one
that
it
seemed,
by
the
sign-in
book,
they
frequently
did).
She
was
still
having
trouble
with
writing,
but
things
had
gotten
much
better
now
that
she
understood
the
writing
process
a
little
further,
helped
by
the
conferences
she
and
I
had
in
the
fall.
She
said
thank
you.
The
second
student
was
one
who
obsessed
over
his
grade.
Of
course,
we
have
no
control
over
this,
no
influence,
and
we
cannot
tell
the
student
what
his
or
her
grade
may
be.
I
followed
his
protocol
and
told
him
so.
The
professor,
like
with
the
first
student,
expressed
concern
over
the
student,
who
came
to
him
with
a
first
draft,
which
resulted
in
the
second
draftNgiven
to
me.
He
then
visited
the
professor
a
third
and
fourth
time,
editing
whenever
the
professor
said
something
needed
work,
needing
validation
that
it
was
done
right.
When
he
received
an
A-,
he
requested
a
rewrite
for
an
A.
He
treated
both
myself
and
the
Writing
Associates
in
general,
the
same
way.
He
attempted
to
converse
with
me
multiple
times
with
different
drafts
of
his
e-mail.
I
saw
he
came
in
twice
in
one
night
to
drop-in,
or
multiple
times
with
the
same
paper
over
a
week.
He
was
determined
to
get
an
A
in
the
course
and
to
graduateNfour
years
laterNwith
a
perfect
4.0.
I
sympathized
with
his
wanting
to
succeed,
but
I
was
also
frustrated.
None
of
my
other
students
treated
me
in
quite
the
same
way.
He
contacted
while
I
was
gone
for
a
weekend
and
when
I
did
not
respond
to
his
e-mail
within
the
same
day,
e-mailed
again
to
make
sure
I
had
received
the
paper.
He
was
asking
for
help
before
our
conference
so
he
could
present
me
with
a
new
draft
for
the
conference.
I
dealt
with
him
through
patience,
which
was
the
only
way.
I
suggested
he
go
to
the
professor
for
help
and
explained
to
him
that
I
felt
it
was
unfair
to
the
other
students
that
he
be
receiving
more
help
from
me
than
just
one
or
two
drafts.
I
had
asked
for
advice
from
a
fellow
Writing
Associate,
who
became
a
friend
of
mine
over
the
year.
Not
only
did
we
discuss
writing
in
general,
but
our
own
personal
scribbles.
I
continually
lean
on
him
for
help
with
writing
and
for
opinions
on
my
writing.
IOve
even
discussed
thesis
ideas
with
him
and
brainstormed
with
his
help.
Though
he
has
since
graduated,
I
hope
he
and
I
will
keep
in
touch
throughout
the
next
years
to
continue
our
friendship
and
sharing
of
writing
styles.
In
the
spring,
with
the
VAST
class
I
was
assigned
to,
I
ventured
into
a
different
type
of
conferenceNthe
group.
In
order
to
hold
four
conferences
with
each
student,
I
used
one
as
a
brainstorming
session
for
students
to
discuss
their
ideas
and
what
they
would
be
doing
with
the
final
paper.
The
students
usually
discussed
their
drafts
in
class
and
took
ideas
from
those,
so
extra
discussion,
I
figured,
couldnOt
hurt.
Most
groups
worked
well
together
and
bounced
ideas
off
of
each
other,
while
others
were
more
quiet
and
needed
a
little
prodding
to
get
the
juices
flowing.
Going
into
the
fall
semester,
I
am
working
with
the
same
professor
I
had
as
my
partner
in
the
spring.
He
and
I
work
well
together
and
I
go
to
him
not
only
as
my
partner
professor
but
for
advice
and
help.
He
has
not
taught
an
FYS
before,
however,
and
I
know
his
expectations
were
high
of
sophomores,
so
I
am
a
little
nervous
to
see
how
he
does
with
the
NnewbiesO
to
Lafayette.
He
is
teaching
two
sections,
so
there
is
a
second
Writing
Associate
working
with
me,
who
I
actually
know,
but
am
not
close
to.
I
have
friends
who
have
worked
with
another
Writing
Associate
in
the
past.
Their
advice
to
me
was
that
I
should
conduct
my
conferences
in
my
usual
style
and
meet
with
the
professor
both
alone
and
with
the
other
student.
We
should
schedule
conferences
to
be
the
same
weeks
and
time
to
discuss
what
has
come
up
in
the
drafts
with
each
other.
The
professor
and
I
have
been
in
contact
throughout
the
summer;
I
know
he
is
looking
forward
to
the
year
and
thinks
I
work
well
with
students
and
help
them
(if
they
want
to
be
helped).
I
know
that
my
year
will
be
busy
with
classes
and
activities,
but
writing
is
a
skill
to
be
honed
and
I
hope
that
I
will
get
plenty
of
practice.
The
more
I
write,
the
better
my
writing
can
become,
and
the
more
I
can
help
other
students
write
their
own
papers
through
conferences
with
me.
Being
a
Writing
Associate,
I
have
learned,
requires
flexibility
and
an
easygoing
attitudeNbut
only
to
an
extent.
It
asks
you
to
be
both
friends
and
an
authority
to
the
student
with
which
you
are
working,
which
can
be
a
difficult
line
to
balance
upon.
In
the
end,
however,
it
is
a
rewarding
experience
and
no
matter
what
troubles
you
encounter,
a
Writing
Associate
can
be
certain
that
they
have
done
some
good.
