Returning
WA
Essay
The
butterflies
started
right
before
my
interview
to
be
a
WA.
The
feeling
grew
especially
strong
as
I
enacted
a
mock
WA
session
with
a
veteran
WA
as
the
faculty
advisors
looked
on.
The
butterflies
eventually
turned
to
feeling
as
if
I
had
a
giant
weight
in
my
stomach
when
I
heard
the
familiar
sound
of
my
cell
phone
ringing
in
my
bag
(to
this
day,
I
swear
I
put
it
on
silent
before
the
interview).
Something
must
have
gone
right
however,
as
I
was
awarded
the
job
I
worked
hard
to
achieve.
Luckily
also,
was
the
fact
that
the
butterflies
eventually
gave
way
to
a
newfound
confidence
in
myself
not
only
as
a
writer,
but
also
as
a
writing
mentor.
This
is
not
to
that
the
road
to
getting
there
was
paved
in
gold,
but
I
did
learn
a
lot
about
myself
along
the
way.
Upon
receiving
my
work
assignment
for
the
fall
semester,
I
was
filled
with
a
certain
level
of
excitement.
I
was
to
work
with
the
FYS
class
that
had
actually
been
my
first
choice
to
be
in
as
a
freshman.
I
figured
that
this
would
be
a
good
way
to
take
the
class
I
hadnOt
been
able
to
two
years
ago.
Upon
my
initial
meeting
with
the
professor,
I
had
a
good
feeling
regarding
my
role
as
a
WA
to
this
particular
class,
which
was
especially
comforting
since
that
would
be
my
first
experience
as
a
WA
and
the
butterflies
still
seemed
to
flutter
around
in
my
stomach
at
this
point.
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
work
with
a
professor
with
whom
I
felt
comfortable
sharing
my
questions
and
concerns,
and
likewise
she
had
no
problem
telling
me
what
she
expected
from
both
her
studentsO
writings
and
from
my
work
for
her.
Creating
a
clear
line
of
communication
between
myself
and
my
professor
was
key
to
how
comfortable
I
felt
working
with
her
and
her
class.
I
did
however
find
that
the
butterflies
returned
before
my
first
round
of
WA
conferences.
I
spent
an
excessively
long
time
reading
each
studentOs
paper
(something
I
quickly
found
out
I
would
not
be
able
to
do
for
the
rest
of
the
semester,
as
their
next
three
papers
were
ten
pages
each!)
and
also
put
an
excessive
amount
of
my
own
notes
and
ideas
on
the
papers
(which
I
also
learned
does
not
help
neither
myself
nor
the
student
as
much
as
I
had
previously
anticipated).
I
decided
right
away
that
in
order
for
me
to
be
a
successful
WA,
I
needed
to
know
my
students
not
only
as
writers,
but
as
people.
I
found
I
was
able
to
do
this
both
in
conversation
with
them,
and
by
the
topics
of
their
first
essay,
which
were
personal
narratives,
giving
me
further
insight
into
their
personal
background
and
the
apprehensions
many
felt
about
their
first
year
of
college.
Certain
students
were
harder
to
get
to
know
both
as
writers
and
as
people
while
others
could
simply
not
stop
talking.
Regardless
of
the
studentOs
personality
or
writing
style,
I
found
that
I
learned
as
much
from
them
as
they
(hopefully)
learned
from
me.
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
work
with
two
students
who
basically
were
born
with
pens
in
their
hands.
I
found
that
while
it
is
a
great
experience
to
work
with
other
gifted
writers,
it
is
also
a
bit
nerve-wracking.
I
did
not
consider
that
some
of
the
students
I
work
with
could
know
just
as
much
about
writing
as
I
did.
Luckily,
there
was
nothing
pretentious
about
either
of
these
girls
and
they
were
among
the
most
receptive
of
my
students.
I
discovered
that
even
if
someone
is
a
great
writer,
they
are
by
no
means
a
perfect
writer.
Everyone
has
aspects
of
their
writing
that
they
can
work
to
improve
on,
a
fact
that
I
try
not
to
forget
myself.
If
one
is
to
work
with
the
so-called
NperfectO
students,
one
must
also
work
with
the
students
who
need
a
bit
more
encouragement,
to
put
it
tactfully.
Obviously
while
all
of
the
students
in
this
FYS
were
full
of
potential,
some
needed
to
work
a
bit
harder
at
applying
themselves.
I
figured
out
that
no
matter
how
much
I
encouraged
or
pushed
certain
students,
some
would
never
come
to
our
conferences
with
more
than
a
third
of
the
paper
written.
While
none
of
these
students
ever
gave
me
any
attitude,
I
did
notice
an
apathetic
air
about
them
during
our
meetings.
I
quickly
learned
that
I
could
not
be
too
serious
around
these
students,
as
they
would
lose
interest
at
an
even
faster
rate.
I
also
learned
that
just
because
they
didnOt
care
doesnOt
mean
that
I
shouldnOt.
These
students
seemed
to
care
about
meeting
me
with
me
a
lot
more
when
because
of
a
lack
of
time,
I
was
forced
to
bring
my
dinner
to
our
conferences.
A
word
of
warning
to
all
new
WAs:
if
you
bring
fries
to
a
conference
with
four
nineteen
year
old
boys,
you
can
bet
they
will
end
up
eating
most
of
your
dinner
and
you
will
end
up
leaving
hungry.
I
hope
that
by
trying
to
get
to
know
and
relate
to
these
students,
they
were
able
to
view
our
WA
conferences
not
as
something
to
dread,
but
as
a
place
to
discuss
their
writing
(and
eat
my
food).
Hopefully
positive
experiences
with
these
conferences
transferred
to
the
way
that
they
feel
about
writing
in
general.
One
of
the
most
difficult
and
rewarding
experiences
I
had
as
a
WA
last
year
was
working
with
a
student
from
China,
whom
before
enrolling
in
her
FYS
had
written
only
one
essay,
which
was
her
personal
statement
to
apply
to
college.
In
China
her
education
centered
on
math
and
science
and
thus,
essay
writing
was
not
an
emphasized
part
of
her
education.
On
top
of
this,
this
student
had
to
write
essays
in
a
language
that
was
not
one
she
was
used
to
speaking
on
a
day
to
day
basis.
This
presented
a
variety
of
challenges
not
only
to
her
as
a
student,
but
to
me
as
her
WA.
She
not
only
needed
to
learn
to
write
as
a
Lafayette
College
student,
but
also
as
an
American
student
and
as
a
writer
in
general.
After
discussing
the
course
of
action
I
should
take
with
my
FYS
professor,
we
decided
it
was
best
that
we
focus
on
the
student
as
a
writer
in
general
and
not
as
an
American
writer.
The
grammar
and
sentence
structure
would
come
on
its
own,
we
both
reasoned,
and
it
was
my
job
to
help
her
with
the
content
and
structure
of
her
essays
and
understanding
the
essay
topics
and
directions
in
general.
While
at
first
it
was
difficult
to
watch
so
many
errors
slide
under
the
radar,
I
found
that
as
the
semester
went
on
her
grammar
did
improve,
but
more
importantly
her
confidence
as
a
writer
advanced
immensely.
The
class
that
I
worked
with
did
often
seemed
overwhelmed
about
the
number
of
essays
that
the
length
of
the
essays
they
were
assigned,
which
I
found
that
I
was
able
to
relate
considering
my
extensive
workload
for
the
semester.
At
times
I
felt
like
my
life
revolved
a
constant
influx
of
essay
writing,
reading,
and
editing.
The
amount
of
writing
I
had
to
do
for
all
of
my
classes
(and
one
in
particular)
did
make
me
more
sympathetic
to
the
writing
that
some
of
my
students
felt
overwhelmed
by.
I
also
found
myself
lending
a
more
critical
eye
to
my
own
papers,
when
I
discovered
many
of
the
very
mistakes
that
I
discussed
with
my
WA
students
present
in
my
own
work.
This
did
make
me
wonder
if
being
a
WA
was
making
me
strive
for
perfection
not
only
in
my
own
writing,
but
also
in
the
writing
of
my
freshmen.
I
tried
to
channel
this
drive
into
a
desire
to
improve
myself
as
a
writer,
but
not
to
allow
it
to
be
all
consuming.
Though
I
was
presented
with
some
challenges
during
my
time
as
a
WA
last
year,
I
feel
that
I
was
lucky
compared
with
the
stories
that
I
heard
my
fellow
WAs
share
at
staff
meetings.
Many
worked
with
students
who
would
remain
absolutely
mute
during
conferences
while
others
worked
with
professors
whom
either
set
unrealistic
expectations
for
their
WAs
or
failed
to
communicate
what
they
wanted
from
both
their
students
and
their
WAs.
At
these
staff
meetings
I
also
took
the
time
to
listen
and
learn
from
the
experiences
of
my
veteran
colleagues.
Such
tips
aided
both
as
a
WA
and
as
a
writer
(yes,
I
had
fallen
under
the
inevitable
trap
of
beginning
to
NWAO
my
own
papers,
which
was
especially
scary
during
my
early
days
as
a
WA
when
I
used
a
great
deal
of
red
pen).
While
my
peers
shared
valuable
and
helpful
tips
and
stories,
I
discovered
that
I
would
grow
quieter
during
the
staff
meetings
because
I
felt
that
their
information
was
somehow
more
intelligent
or
helpful
than
what
I
would
have
to
contribute
to
the
group
since
I
had
less
experience
on
my
side.
Looking
back,
I
wish
that
I
did
not
feel
as
NintimatedO
as
a
did
by
my
peers
and
realized
that
though
I
did
not
have
as
long
a
history
of
being
WA
as
some
of
my
colleagues,
I
did
get
this
job
for
a
reason
and
that
what
I
had
to
offer,
especially
as
new
WA,
could
bring
a
fresh
perspective
to
the
group.
My
experience
as
a
WA
lasted
only
during
the
fall
semester,
but
that
did
not
mean
that
my
writing
skills
were
not
continuously
challenged
throughout
the
rest
of
the
school
year.
I
spent
the
spring
semester
of
my
junior
studying
abroad
at
a
British
university
in
England.
I
specify
that
this
was
a
British
university
because
I
was
expected
to
write
and
learn
as
a
British
student,
with
whom
I
took
all
of
my
courses.
Obviously
studying
abroad
presented
its
own
share
of
challenges,
but
my
education
had
its
share
of
unique
obstacles
for
me
to
tackle.
My
grades
for
my
classes
were
based
primarily
on
two
essays,
which
put
a
great
deal
of
pressure
on
my
performance.
I
quickly
discovered
that
the
British
system
of
essay
writing
was
quite
different
than
the
American
system.
I
was
reminded
of
the
Chinese
student
that
I
worked
with,
only
realizing
that
she
not
only
had
to
learn
a
different
style
of
writing,
but
also
a
different
language
and
how
to
write
in
general.
Her
experience
as
a
writer
made
me
look
like
a
wimp
for
feeling
overwhelmed
and
nervous
about
my
writing
here.
I
tried
to
adjust
myself
to
a
system
of
essay
writing
that
was
based
not
on
my
own
opinions
and
analysis,
but
the
analysis
of
numerous
outside
sources
and
a
great
deal
of
research.
I
wonOt
even
get
into
the
grammatical
differences
that
exist
between
English
English
and
American
English
(who
would
have
thought
that
the
British
use
only
one
quotation
mark
around
quoted
text?).
I
found
myself
growing
frustrated
at
having
to
change
the
way
that
I
wrote
(which
before
studying
abroad,
I
assumed
was
the
right
way,
or
at
least
was
pretty
close
NrightO
based
on
my
performance
for
the
past
twenty
one
years)
and
growing
even
more
frustrated
when
such
change
was
not
achieved
as
easily
as
I
had
anticipated.
The
frustration
mounted
even
further
as
I
carried
what
seemed
like
forty
pounds
of
books
on
my
back
from
the
two
mile
(yes,
two
mile)
walk
from
the
library
to
my
dorm,
cursing
the
British
education
system
under
my
breath
the
whole
time.
And
yes,
I
became
even
more
frustrated
when
I
received
my
grades
on
some
of
these
essays.
I
tried
to
keep
in
mind
the
differences
between
the
British
and
American
systems
of
grading
to
prevent
discouragement
from
taking
full
force,
though
I
was
still
disappointed
to
see
my
hard
get
knocked
down
as
much
as
it
had.
I
realized
that
like
the
two
Nperfect
studentsO
I
worked
with,
that
while
I
may
have
shone
as
a
writer
back
at
home,
I
had
a
lot
to
learn
as
a
writer
at
a
new
university,
in
an
entirely
new
country.
And
learn
I
did;
my
research
skill
have
improved
ten-fold
(while
at
the
same
time
strengthened
my
back
muscles)
and
I
have
become
more
comfortable
writing
about
new
disciplines
in
entirely
new
ways.
Who
knows,
maybe
if
I
had
studied
abroad
for
a
year
I
could
have
become
an
extremely
competent
British
writer,
but
I
discovered
that
by
the
end
of
my
four
months
abroad,
I
could
use
these
newly
acquired
skills
to
improve
myself
as
an
American
writer.
Studying
abroad
not
only
expanded
my
horizons,
but
also
made
me
more
appreciative
of
my
life
as
an
American
student.
British
education
was
extremely
focused
on
individual
work
and
effort;
professors
actually
play
a
very
small
part
in
the
educational
process.
The
students
then
were
very
much
on
their
own,
which
was
especially
scary
considering
that
I
was
really,
really
alone
in
this
new
country.
This
experience
made
me
not
only
appreciate
my
American
professors
and
classes
to
a
greater
extent,
but
also
my
role
as
a
WA
and
the
WA
program
in
general.
I
realized
just
how
important
it
is
to
provide
support
to
students
writing
under
a
new
system
of
rules
and
standards,
no
matter
how
competent
of
a
writer
that
student
may
be.
Just
as
the
move
from
an
American
to
a
British
university
presents
a
new
set
of
rules
and
guidelines,
so
does
the
move
from
high
school
writing
to
college
writing,
facts
I
discovered
from
my
experience
abroad
and
my
experience
working
with
college
freshman.
We
all
had
writing
experience
behind
us,
but
as
we
quickly
found
out,
we
all
still
had
so
much
more
to
learn.
That
really
is
what
being
a
WA
is
all
about;
learning
from
your
school
and
your
peers,
and
passing
that
knowledge
on.
IOm
looking
forward
to
the
WA
experience
once
again
this
year,
after
a
nine
month
hiatus.
IOm
looking
forward
to
being
in
a
country
where
I
understand
what
the
writing
fundamentals,
but
to
still
have
both
my
fellow
WAs
and
my
NWA-eesO
to
guide
me
along
the
way.
