My
Time
as
a
Writer:
An
Unfinished
Tale
Class
of
2005
Writing
Associate
Paper
In
the
ancient
days
of
the
Apple
II
and
George
Bush
senior,
school
was
much
different
than
its
present
incarnation.
Kindergarten
and
first
grade
sought
to
teach
student
to
read,
while
students
usually
sat
through
these
mundane
activities
with
the
intent
of
venturing
outside
to
play
during
recess.
It
was
in
much
this
same
way
that
I
treated
my
very
first
writing
assignments.
When
Mrs.
Snyder
announced
to
her
first
grade
class
that
we
would
be
creating
books,
my
excitement
stemmed
from
the
chance
to
draw
and
color
pictures,
rather
than
the
opportunity
to
express
some
series
of
thoughts
with
words.
Despite
my
enjoyment
of
my
parents
reading
to
me,
I
was
still
a
first
grader,
and
even
being
a
fairly
advanced
student
did
not
diminish
my
desire
to
have
fun
rather
drawing
rather
than
to
have
to
write.
Yet,
it
was
an
assignment
and
as
with
all
assignments,
I
did
what
was
required.
My
first
short
story
described
a
trip
to
the
local
mall;
the
stores
that
my
family
went
to,
the
treat
of
pizza
in
the
food
court,
the
drive
home.
As
narrations
go,
it
was
about
as
straight
forward
as
possible,
not
to
mention
terse.
As
a
first
grader,
I
wasn't
exactly
filling
the
pages
with
multi-syllabic
words
and
clause-filled
sentences.
In
fact,
each
page
probably
only
had
a
single
sentence
on
it.
At
the
time,
I
was
much
prouder
of
the
artwork
than
the
sentences.
It
took
a
great
deal
of
skill,
as
well
as
a
large
box
of
crayons,
to
create
the
cover
for
my
book.
The
illustration
used
to
entice
the
reader
to
my
story
was
what
every
sane
person
thinks
of
when
he
or
she
envisions
a
trip
to
the
mall,
a
space
ship
bristling
with
guns
that
seem
to
fire
colorful
line
segments
in
every
direction.
Though
the
artwork
within
the
book
was
much
more
suited
to
its
content,
I
was
most
proud
of
my
cover.
We
would
go
on
to
write
other
stories
throughout
the
year,
as
a
means
of
exercising
our
growing
spelling
and
writing
abilities.
I
must
admit,
by
the
end
of
the
year,
I
felt
that
writing
these
short
books
wasn't
so
bad
after
all.
Progressing
through
the
elementary
years
introduced
such
concepts
as
the
paragraph,
the
short
essay,
and
even
the
dreaded
two-page
paper.
As
was
normal,
my
assignments
were
usually
in
the
upper
tier
of
the
class
in
terms
of
skill
level.
There
were
no
real
stand
out
assignments
during
this
time,
merely
a
normal
progression
of
reading
and
writing
that
is
perhaps
not
so
normal
in
other
schools.
The
Accelerated
Reader
program
provided
incentive,
during
these
years,
to
read
a
variety
of
books
at
a
variety
of
skill
levels.
At
the
conclusion
of
a
book,
a
student
could
opt
to
answer
a
short
series
of
multiple-choice
questions
about
the
book,
with
points
being
earned
for
correct
answers.
Books
best
described
as
those
for
beginning
readers
were
worth
a
few
points,
while
novels
such
as
Huckleberry
Fin
were
worth
many
points.
By
my
graduation
from
elementary
center
in
fourth
grade,
I
was
tied
with
a
fellow
student
for
the
highest
number
of
points
in
the
AR
program.
In
retrospect,
the
desire
to
read
that
was
first
nurtured
during
this
time
would
prove
to
be
a
key
component
of
a
being
a
successful
writer.
However,
at
the
time
no
such
thought
was
in
my
mind.
All
I
recognized
was
that
reading
could
be
fun
provided
a
person
found
enjoyable
material.
Throughout
the
initial
years
of
middle
school,
the
demands
placed
on
me
gradually
broadened
to
include
multiple
papers
in
a
class,
and
even
several
papers
at
one
time
for
different
classes.
The
idea
of
a
research
paper
was
hinted
at,
with
requirements
now
including
a
title
page,
several
pages
worth
of
material,
and
a
bibliography.
At
the
time,
it
seemed
terribly
odd
not
to
simply
put
my
name
in
the
top
right
hand
corner,
though
it
wasn't
that
big
of
a
deal.
The
first
real
introduction
to
a
paper
that
required
a
great
deal
of
work
was
in
sixth
grade,
in
my
history
class.
Throughout
fifth
grade,
we
heard
terrible
stories
of
a
teacher
who
required
a
lengthy,
researched
paper
and
a
prepared
talk,
as
well
as
a
visual
or
auditory
project
to
go
with
the
talk.
When
this
project
came
upon
me
in
sixth
grade,
I
felt
rather
apprehensive
at
the
scale
of
the
entire
assignment.
Though
there
was
ample
time
to
complete
the
work,
the
sheer
scope
of
the
requirements
was
daunting:
a
project,
a
talk
in
front
of
a
class
and
multiple
teachers,
and
a
paper
with
a
length
of
at
least
five
pages
and
a
bibliography.
This
teacher
had
to
be
out
of
his
mind.
No
student
could
reasonably
do
all
this.
After
the
initial
shock
wore
off,
I
began
to
work
on
the
research
aspect
of
the
paper.
I
was
introduced
to
the
concept
of
writing
down
facts
and
notes
on
individual
note
cards,
with
a
single
note
or
fact
to
each
card
and
the
source
information
on
the
back.
Though
this
seemed
a
terribly
inefficient
means
of
taking
down
information
compared
to
the
popular
notes-on-a-sheet-of-paper
approach,
it
was
required.
After
a
week
of
research
and
a
week
for
writing,
the
first
draft
of
my
paper
was
due.
I
didn't
realize
at
the
time,
but
this
was
my
first
introduction
to
process
writing.
The
teacher,
in
evaluating
the
first
draft,
provided
suggestions
as
to
what
and
where
to
improve,
from
the
inclusion
of
additional
facts,
to
the
rearrangement
of
topics
to
make
the
paper
more
easily
flow.
Revising
would
lead
to
a
second
draft
and
further
revision
before
the
final
copy
was
turned
in.
Through
this
process,
I
gained
a
keen
familiarity
with
the
information
contained
in
my
paper,
while
also
becoming
used
to
the
concept
of
revision
in
writing.
As
was
a
part
of
the
overall
project,
I
created
a
visual
aid
and
an
explanatory
talk
based
upon
my
topic.
Because
of
the
revising
process,
I
had
gained
fluency
with
my
information,
allowing
the
talk
to
be
created
and
performed
with
relatively
little
extra
effort.
At
its
conclusion,
the
project
was
a
success,
with
the
assignment
being
a
milestone
in
my
writing
career:
the
first
researched
paper.
Middle
school
led
to
high
school,
and
with
high
school
came
a
whole
new
set
of
standards
to
which
my
work
would
be
graded.
I
was
determined
to
live
up
to
these
expectations
as
best
I
could,
with
the
first
real
test
coming
in
tenth
grade's
AP
History
class.
Mrs.
Clevely
was
highly
regarded
for
being
stringent
with
praise
(and
also
with
A's).
Throughout
her
class,
assignments
focused
mainly
on
short
to
moderate
length
essays
that
asked
me
to
critically
analyze
various
readings,
pulling
details
from
them
until
I
could
form
an
answer
to
a
question.
At
first,
I
allowed
myself
a
great
deal
of
time
to
complete
these
works,
writing
carefully,
but
not
being
as
succinct
as
I
possibly
could.
In
essence,
I
began
by
using
the
shotgun
approach,
including
a
multitude
of
bits
of
information
in
order
to
prove
my
point.
This
method
achieved
moderate
success,
though
still
not
the
level
of
achievement
I
was
hoping
for.
As
Mrs.
Clevely
had
pointed
out
in
my
initial
assignments,
I
should
be
a
bit
more
judicious
with
the
inclusion
of
inessential
details,
while
also
being
a
bit
less
verbose.
Sometimes,
it's
just
important
to
get
the
point
across,
not
to
dress
it
in
a
lot
of
flowery
language.
This
was
a
lesson
that
I
was
able
to
put
to
use
throughout
the
rest
of
the
course,
becoming
both
better
and
quicker
at
writing
these
essays.
I
was
glad
to
have
increased
my
proficiency
with
these
assignments;
I
knew
coming
years
would
herald
the
dreaded
timed
in-class
essay.
With
AP
English
and
AP
Government
in
twelfth
grade,
timed
writing
arrived,
though
more
gently
than
I
had
initially
thought.
Both
classes
required
critical
analysis
to
produce
an
essay.
With
Government,
questions
usually
focused
on
elucidating
some
key
points
in
the
current
topic,
while
English
almost
always
required
me
to
analyze
different
parts
of
a
piece
of
writing
to
gain
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
work.
Though
these
were
two
different
approaches
to
presenting
information
about
some
given
topic,
their
methodology
was
strikingly
similar.
As
the
year
progressed,
I
went
from
being
given
the
questions
ahead
of
time
to
prepare
notes
for
use
during
the
writing,
from
being
given
several
questions
with
one
or
two
selected
on
the
test,
to
merely
having
a
topic
described
before
being
given
the
actual
test.
By
gradually
weaning
me
off
the
crutch
of
knowing
the
question
ahead
of
time,
my
two
teachers
helped
me
to
learn
to
think
on
my
feet,
to
organize
thoughts
before
writing,
and
do
it
in
a
timely
manner.
Though
I
haven't
actually
had
timed
writing
since
these
courses,
their
lessons
can
be
easily
applied
for
any
writing
assignment
in
order
to
decrease
the
work
time
and
increase
the
quality
in
one
fell
stroke.
Graduation
from
high
school
heralded
the
end
of
one
era,
and
the
beginning
of
the
next
at
Lafayette.
Entering
with
a
multitude
of
advanced
credits
made
me
think
that
I
was
"hot
stuff",
and
would
have
no
problems
in
this
atmosphere.
For
the
most
part,
this
has
been
correct,
as
I've
encountered
few
problems
that
hard
work
will
not
provide
a
solution
for.
However,
Professor
Hoffman's
FYS
proved
to
be
a
difficult
beast
to
master,
though
I
gained
a
great
appreciation
for
it
in
the
process.
I
was
thrilled
to
be
able
to
write
about
a
topic
I
enjoyed
so
much:
the
science
behind
science
fiction.
I
believe
I
would
have
no
problem
getting
an
A
in
this
course;
I
loved
the
material,
I
wasn't
afraid
of
hard
work,
and
I
knew
how
to
write.
So
getting
back
my
first
draft
with
comments
from
my
WA
and
from
the
professor
was
no
real
stroke
to
the
ego,
I
expected
a
good
bit
of
revision
for
the
final
copy.
The
surprise
came
with
the
grade,
an
A-?
I
was
confused,
and
partially
angry,
wondering
what
had
I
not
included
to
make
this
an
A
paper,
in
his
estimation.
In
this
same
way,
the
second
and
third
papers
proceeded.
I
was
able
to
turn
in
quality
pieces
of
work,
with
each
getting
progressively
better
in
terms
of
style.
However,
each
final
draft
resulted
in
an
A-.
I
could
not
understand
what
I
was
doing
wrong
until
I
spoke
with
Professor
Hoffman
after
the
semester
ended.
With
each
final
draft,
my
writing
would
get
better,
and
yet
the
grade
wouldn't.
Professor
Hoffman
told
me
that
improvement
was
built
into
the
expectations
and
that,
though
I
hadn't
received
A's,
my
final
drafts
were
well
thought
out
pieces
of
writing,
with
both
insight
and
a
little
bit
of
flare.
Admittedly,
Professor
Hoffman
didn't
use
the
word
'flare',
but
it
suits
just
as
well.
Most
importantly,
Professor
Hoffman
made
it
clear
that
sometimes,
the
requirements
for
an
A
versus
an
A-were
sometimes
a
much
larger
step
than
those
for
a
B
compared
to
a
B-.
College
is
designed
to
be
difficult,
in
order
to
challenge
students
to
achieve
their
fullest.
To
do
this,
sometimes
the
bar
must
be
set
very
high,
especially
for
those
who
are
already
talented.
To
get
everyone
to
improve
their
skills,
college
must
set
a
bar
for
each
student,
and
some
bars
are
just
higher
than
others
in
certain
classes.
At
the
conclusion
of
my
FYS,
I
gained
a
new
respect
for
my
writing.
I
realized
there
is
still
room
for
improvement,
and
that
this
improvement
is
a
reasonable
expectation
for
professors
to
have.
No
one
is
a
perfect
writer;
journalists,
novelists,
and
even
professors
are
looking
to
constantly
produce
the
best
possible
piece
of
work.
I've
attempted
to
put
these
lessons
to
use
in
my
current
writing
project:
an
article
for
publication
in
a
professional
journal
of
mathematics.
With
the
help
of
Professor
Reiter,
I'm
currently
revising
and
editing
my
article
to
make
it
a
clear,
concise
piece
of
writing
that
contains
few
inessential
details
while
still
allowing
a
reader
to
enjoy
the
work
and
it's
topic.
It's
daunting
to
think
that
someone
beyond
my
small
world
may
actually
read
a
piece
of
my
writing,
but
also
inspiring
at
the
same
time.
Knowing
that
I
have
the
possibility
of
being
published
has
kindled
in
me
a
sense
of
pride
in
my
writing.
I've
realized
that,
without
the
process
I've
gone
through
from
first
grade
to
first
year
in
college,
I
would
not
be
able
to
consider
placing
my
work
under
the
scrutiny
of
so
many.
However,
because
I
currently
have
the
opportunity
to
publish
work
does
not
mean
that
my
writing
skills
are
at
their
zenith.
The
attempt
to
hone
my
skills
has
allowed
me
to
realize
that
it
will
be
a
never-ending
journey,
filled
with
hard
work,
success,
failure,
and
more
hard
work.
I've
learned
to
accept
this
fact,
and
I
believe
that
my
future
growth
as
a
writer
will
be
aided
by
this
understanding.
