Literacy
Narrative
Ooh,
ooh,
pick
me,
pick
me,
I
thought
as
I
anxiously
waved
my
tiny
hand
in
the
air,
trying
desperately
to
become
noticed.
No,
I
was
not
in
the
running
for
class
president,
nor
was
I
attempting
to
be
chosen
for
the
cool
kickball
team
in
gym
class.
Actually
my
first
grade
teacher,
Sister
Patricia
had
just
asked
the
class,
Who
would
like
to
read
their
homework
assignment
aloud
to
the
entire
class?
Normally
I
was
a
very
reserved
student
who
rarely
tried
to
be
the
center
of
attention,
but
to
this
question
I
just
had
to
be
picked.
You
see,
our
homework
assignment
from
the
night
before
was
quite
simple-
write
about
someone
in
your
family
and
include
a
picture.
This
does
not
seem
too
incredibly
challenging,
but
to
a
precocious
first
grader
with
a
newborn
baby
brother,
this
was
the
chance
of
a
lifetime.
I
could
finally
reveal
to
the
rest
of
the
class,
as
well
as
my
teacher,
what
a
mature
older
sister
I
was!
Furthermore,
I
could
show
off
the
adorable
picture
of
my
new
baby
brother.
Fortunately
for
me,
Sister
Patricia
quickly
noticed
my
eagerness
to
read
and
allowed
me
to
tell
the
class
about
the
birth
of
my
brother
Todd
Garret.
I
was
in
my
glory!
The
day
before,
my
teacher
handed
out
thick-lined
paper
with
room
up
top
for
a
drawing.
My
mom
had
helped
me
prepare
the
paper
the
night
before
by
telling
me
all
about
the
birth
of
my
brother
and
how
excited
she
and
my
father
were.
I
used
a
yellow
#2
pencil
to
carefully
and
slowly
construct
each
letter
of
each
short
sentence.
Instead
of
drawing
a
picture
of
my
infant
brother,
my
mom
assisted
me
in
stapling
one
of
his
hospital
pictures
onto
the
page.
Now,
I
assure
you
that
this
was
no
child-genius
report
I
wrote,
but
it
was
the
first
written
work,
that
I
can
remember
anyway,
that
made
me
really
proud.
In
retrospect,
it
was
probably
those
innocent
reports
that
allowed
me
to
first
begin
to
write
creatively
and
for
a
purpose.
For
example,
with
this
report,
I
wanted
to
show
the
class
that
I
was
a
mature
older
sister
with
adult
responsibilities,
and
we
all
know
how
important
that
is
to
a
first
grader!
I
was
also
just
dying
to
tell
anyone
who
would
listen
about
my
cute
baby
brother.
Thus,
I
believe
that
these
introductory
writing
experiences
shaped
me
as
a
writer
by
allowing
me
to
learn
that
I
could
convey
my
thoughts
and
share
my
experiences
with
others
by
means
of
the
written
word.
I
also
remember
that
during
recess
that
day,
after
reading
my
paper,
a
bunch
of
my
class
mates
confronted
me
about
my
new
baby
brother.
They
wanted
to
share
stories
about
their
siblings,
and
tell
me
about
their
duties
as
older
brothers
and
sisters.
Thus,
I
can
also
confess
that
by
sharing
my
earlier
writings
with
an
audience,
I
learned
that
it
is
an
easy
way
to
make
friends!
The
previous
memory
I
had
about
one
of
my
first
writing
attempts
turned
out
to
be
very
positive
and
productive.
I
know
that
I
continued
to
write
and
these
memories
are
sealed
forever
in
countless
Mother's
Day
poems,
Father's
Day
sonnets,
and
seemingly
endless
book
reports
hanging
on
the
refrigerator
door.
Yet,
not
all
of
my
early
writing
attempts
proved
fruitful.
I
can
remember
a
distinct
written
piece
that
turned
out
just
plain
nasty.
First
we
must
fast
forward
a
couple
of
years
to
Mrs.
Schwab's
fourth
grade
class.
This
was
a
difficult
year
for
me:
my
family
had
just
moved
to
another
town,
my
mom
was
(very)
pregnant
with
another
baby,
and
1
had
entered
the
realm
of
public
school.
I
had
gone
to
Catholic
school
all
my
life
thus
far,
and
I
was
very
nervous
about
starting
a
new
school
where
I
knew
no
one.
Needless
to
say,
1
was
a
bit
mixed
up
and
bewildered
in
my
new
environment.
Mrs.
Schwab
was
a
strict
teacher,
she
rarely
smiled
and
always
wore
the
same
old
green
wool
sweater
(even
in
the
spring)!
Kids
used
to
joke
that
lived
alone
with
1,000
cats
and
flew
around
on
a
broomstick
at
night.
I'm
sure
we've
all
had
an
encounter
with
one
of
those
types
of
teachers
so
there
is
no
need
for
further
description.
In
any
case,
she
assigned
a
twenty
page
state
report
in
mid-February,
to
be
turned
in
at
the
end
of
the
month.
In
fourth
grade
twenty
pages
sounds
like
it
might
take
twenty
years
to
finish,
so
I
was
not
very
eager
to
start
this
grueling
report.
The
report
seemed
incredibly
boring:
we
were
instructed
to
research
anything
and
everything
about
the
state
of
our
choice:
annual
rainfall
percentages,
population,
attractions,
vegetation,
agriculture,
land
resources,
state
symbols,
etc.
This
was
not
exactly
the
most
creative
research
paper,
and
I
was
really
uninspired.
Each
day
we
were
supposed
to
research
one
of
these
areas
and
slowly
accumulate
this
twenty
page
report.
Well,
being
the
procrastinator
that
1
am,
I
decided
that
I
could
somehow
wait
until
the
night
before
the
report
was
due
to
begin.
I
remember
telling
my
mother,
reluctantly,
that
I
had
to
finish
my
twenty
page
research
paper
on
Florida
tonight.
My
mother
asked
coyly,
Well,
how
much
more
do
you
need
to
add?
Squirming
in
my
seat,
because
I
knew
that
my
response
would
elicit
an
angry
reaction
I
quietly
replied,
I
haven't
started
yet.
As
I
predicted,
my
mother
went
bizerk,
yelling
about
responsibility
to
my
schoolwork
,
..the
importance
of
getting
good
grades,
and
how
could
I
expect
to
do
in
middle
school?
After
my
mother
calmed
down,
she
stayed
up
until
4
am
with
me,
helping
me
research
Florida,
paste
pictures
from
family
vacations
past,
trace
and
color
the
state
bird,
bee,
flag
and
flower,
and
write
out
the
entire
twenty
page
report.
The
next
day
1
was
so
exhausted
from
my
first
all-nighter
that
I
vowed
to
never
do
it
again.
I
was
also
not
so
eager
to
read
the
oral
portion
of
my
report
and
slumped
in
the
back
of
the
classroom,
hoping
to
be
glanced
over.
Unfortunately,
we
were
going
in
alphabetical
order
and
that
put
me
at
number
six.
Since
I
did
not
have
much
time
to
rehearse
my
oral
report
(as
1
was
up
all
night
writing
and
researching),
it
was
really
incoherent
and
basically
stunk.
My
classmates
gave
me
horrible
peer
evaluations,
and
the
teacher
called
my
mother
that
day
to
ask
if
there
were
problems
at
home.
My
mother
explained
what
had
happened
to
Mrs.
Schwab
and
set
up
a
special
program
with
her
where
my
mother
would
receive
a
copy
of
all
my
homework
assignments
a
week
in
advance.
Mrs.
Schwab
was
required
to
check
them
every
day,
even
if
she
did
not
check
the
other
students.
From
this
horrible
experience
I
learned
that
there
are
some
genres
of
writing
(like
research
papers
and
lab
reports,
which
I
also
do
not
enjoy)
that
are
assigned
not
for
their
creative
expression,
but
for
their
learning
value.
Although
my
Florida
report
did
not
turn
out
to
be
a
successful
research
paper,
it
did
allow
me
to
learn
the
value
of
preparation
and
consistency
in
writing.
I
still
have
that
research
paper,
and
every
time
I
remember
it,
do
you
know
what
sticks
out
in
my
mind?
The
baggy
eyes
and
pounding
headache
I
woke
up
to
the
next
morning!
Well,
I
never
thought
that
I
would
make
it
out
of
fourth
grade
and
into
middle
school,
but
finally
I
did.
This
was
big
time!
I
had
acquired
a
close
knit
group
of
girl
friends,
I
had
a
new
little
sister,
Alexis
Dawn,
and
I
really
felt
like
I
fit
in
as
I
entered
Pearl
R.
Miller
middle
school.
I
no
longer
had
one
teacher
for
each
subject,
nope,
we
changed
classes
rooms
and
teachers
every
forty
minutes.
I
had
my
own
locker,
a
home
room,
and
was
able
to
pick
some
of
my
own
classes.
I
had
a
little
taste
of
freedom
and
I
wanted
more!
In
regard
to
my
writing
I
was
able
to
become
more
creative
as
I
enrolled
in
a
poetry
course.
We
studied
the
Greats;
Byron,
Tennyson,
Poe,
Frost
and
many
more.
I
became
enthralled
with
poetry
and
began
keeping
a
poetry
journal
of
my
own.
The
poems
that
I
composed
were
mainly
about
my
sixth
grade
life:
my
friends,
the
mall,
music,
boys,
and
clothes.
In
retrospect,
the
poems
were
pretty
superficial
but
they
definitely
represent
my
mindset
during
that
time.
One
of
my
most
memorable
writing
experiences
occurred
this
year
when
my
poetry
teacher,
Mrs.
Johnson,
required
us
to
submit
a
compilation
of
our
own
poetry.
This
poetry
packet
was
to
include
various
genres
of
poetry
such
as
haiku,
sonnet,
free
verse,
rhyme
verse,
Shakespearean,
Elizabethan,
as
well
as
the
lyrics
to
a
song
I
felt
pertained
to
my
life.
I
was
delighted
to
complete
this
project,
and
this
time
I
was
surely
was
not
going
to
wait
until
the
last
minute
to
begin!
The
poems
came
easily
to
me,
but
I
still
sought
the
aid
of
Mrs.
Johnson
who
encouraged
me
to
constantly
improve
my
works
in
progress.
When
I
finally
submitted
the
poetry
packet,
entitled
My
Poetic
World.
I
felt
an
enormous
sense
of
accomplishment
and
gratification.
That
feeling
was
enhanced
about
a
billion
times
when,
a
week
later,
Mrs.
Johnson
asked
me
to
read
one
of
my
poems
aloud
to
the
class.
Furthermore,
she
commented
on
my
creativity
and
unique
flair
to
the
entire
class!
This
was
probably
the
most
fulfilling
moment
of
my
entire
writing
career
thus
far.
From
this
poetry
class
I
learned
a
lot
about
great
poets,
composing
poetry,
as
well
as
gaining
a
better
sense
of
myself
as
a
talented
creative
writer.
Middle
School
flew
by
like
a
whirlwind
and
in
no
time
at
all
I
was
about
to
enter
a
whole
new
world-
high
school.
This
meant
even
more
freedom-1
no
longer
took
the
dorky
yellow
bus
to
school.
I
now
got
a
ride
in
a
red
BMW
convertible
with
my
best
friends
older
sister.
High
school
offered
a
more
diverse
course
load
and
I
was
able
to
select
classes
that
captivated
my
interest.
I
decided
to
enroll
in
a
current
events
course
that
would
allow
me
to
follow
breaking
news
stories
and
report
the
development
to
the
class.
During
the
year
each
student
was
required
to
report,
record,
and
present
five
different
news
stories.
This
was
always
a
pretty
exciting
assignment
because
the
teacher,
Mr.
Badgerly,
gave
bonus
points
to
students
who
reported
a
breaking
story
first.
I
felt
like
a
real
reporter-
getting
up
early
before
school
to
watch
the
news,
tuning
into
the
am
radio
stations
on
the
way
to
school,
and
inquiring
about
any
local
news
stories.
I
was
also
required
to
write
up
my
findings
in
a
newspaper
format,
reporting
to
the
people
(the
class)
the
late
breaking
news
stories.
I
liked
journalism
and
field
reporting
and
even
felt
(at
one
point)
that
this
might
be
a
great
career
for
me.
Yet,
my
vision
of
news
reporters
changed
drastically
that
year
when
an
international
news
story
became
too
personal.
One
day
after
leaving
school
my
boyfriend
Ryan
and
I
were
bombarded
in
the
school
parking
lot
by
news
reporters
asking
him
questions
about
his
family
and
snapping
photos.
We
were
dumbstruck.
Neither
of
us
knew
why
the
reporters
were
asking
questions
about
Ryan's
father,
and
they
(the
reporters)
would
not
tell
us
what
was
going
on.
It
turns
out
that
his
father,
Toshihide
Iguchi,
was
just
arrested
for
an
eleven
year
fraud
at
the
Daiwa
Bank
in
New
York
City
and
Japan.
It
was
the
second
biggest
bank
fraud
in
the
world,
and
Ryan's
father
was
at
the
center
of
the
scandal.
Reporters
stalked
Ryan
and
his
brother
Ben's
friends,
family,
and
acquaintances,
begging
for
just
a
small
piece
of
information.
This
family's
life
was
turned
upside
down
by
these
nagging
reporters
as
they
were
forced
to
sneak
around
everywhere.
From
this
experience
I
learned
that
even
though
reporting
the
news
to
the
people
is
important,
the
process
of
getting
the
story
can
be
invasive
and
nerve
racking.
I
even
embellished
on
this
negative
experience
with
the
press
for
my
college
entrance
essay.
I
know
that
the
experience
has
made
a
lasting
impression
on
me,
as
I
am
still
writing
about
it
four
years
later.
My
high
school
writing
attempts
were
definitely
learning
experiences.
I
had
the
opportunity
to
produce
many
different
genres
of
writing
from
lab
reports,
news
reports,
book
reports,
research
papers,
term
papers
and
creative
stories.
These
writing
acts
were
all
in
preparation
for
college
level
writing
at
Lafayette.
Before
starting
college
I
began
to
get
nervous
about
writing
for
college
professors.
I
had
already
declared
myself
an
English
major
because
1
had
always
gravitated
towards
the
more
creative
reading
and
writing
classes
in
high
school.
Yet,
that
made
me
even
more
afraid
because
I
though
that
the
professors
would
expect
me
to
be
an
excellent
writer.
I
began
to
doubt
myself
and
my
abilities,
thinking,
I
will
never
make
it
in
college.
These
fears
were
dispelled
the
first
day
that
I
entered
my
First
Year
Seminar,
entitled
The
American
College
Student.
This
course
was
extremely
interesting
because
we
were
reading
about
the
fears,
hopes,
dreams,
problems,
expectations,
conflicts,
and
challenges
of
First
Year
college
students,
while
going
through
it
all....together.
My
professors
let
us
know
right
off
the
bat
that
they
did
not
expect
any
of
us
to
write
on
a
college
level
just
yet.
They
assured
us
that
through
this
course
we
would
learn
how
to
meet
a
college
professors
expectations.
Furthermore,
with
the
help
of
our
Writing
Associate,
we
would
acquire
the
necessary
literary
tools
we
needed
to
create
literary
masterpieces.
Even
though
the
professors
assured
the
class
that
they
would
help
improve
our
writing
throughout
the
semester,
I
was
still
a
bit
hesitant
to
hand
in
my
first
written
piece.
The
introductory
assignment
was
simple-
we
were
instructed
to
keep
a
journal
of
daily
college
experiences
and
encounters
that
challenged,
surprised,
or
frustrated
us.
We
would
then
have
to
relate
these
personal
experiences
to
examples
or
theories
given
by
authors
that
we
read.
At
first
I
spent
hours
trying
to
perfect
each
sentance,
used
the
Thesaurus
to
find
difficult
words,
and
picked
out
only
those
experiences
that
made
me
seem
like
an
intelligent
college
student.
Yet,
my
professors
quickly
noticed
that
I
was
trying
way
too
hard
to
write
like
an
academic,
rather
than
just
express
myself
and
overcome
some
of
my
writing
fears.
Once
I
learned
to
let
loose
and
express
my
challenges
concerning
college
life,
I
became
comfortable
talking
about
them,
and
started
improving
my
own
style
of
writing.
Through
my
years
at
Lafayette,
1
have
experience
great
support
from
all
of
my
professors,
many
whom
have
strongly
influenced
my
course
selection
and
persistence
to
become
a
better
writer.
I
am
also
very
excited
to
help
other
Lafayette
students
improve
their
writing
as
a
new
Writing
Associate.
When
I
first
began
this
literacy
narrative,
I
could
not
quite
pinpoint
the
significant
writing
attempts
that
shaped
me
as
an
academic
writer.
As
I
started
talking
to
my
mother
about
my
childhood
writing
experiences,
it
ignited
memories
of
different
writing
challenges,
triumphs,
failures,
and
everything
in
between.
All
of
these
learning
encounters
have
shaped
me
as
a
writer,
from
the
Columbus
Day
tribute
haiku
in
second
grade,
to
the
fifteen
page
report
on

in
high
school
biology.
All
these
writing
assignments,

not,
have
led
me
to
become
a
confident,
diverse
academic
writer.
Admittedly,
who
still
has
a
lot
to
learn!
