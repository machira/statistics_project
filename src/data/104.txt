Literacy
Narrative
A
Writing
History
I
have
many
friends
who
constantly
tell
me
how
much
writing
is
a
passion
is
in
their
lives
but
I
am
afraid
I
would
not
use
that
adjective
to
describe
my
relationship
with
writing.
I
would
rather
say
that
reading
is
a
passion
and
writing
is
a...,
probably
something
I
still
have
to
figure
out.
This
does
not
mean
that
I
do
not
enjoy
writing.
On
the
contrary,
I
must
admit
I
have
written
some
essays
worth
bragging
about
in
my
life.
There
were
even
times
when
I
would
feel
so
good
about
an
essay
that
I
would
completely
engulf
myself
in
it.
These
however
are
not
the
majority
of
times,
at
least
not
before
I
started
college.
In
this
paper,
I
will
walk
you
through
my
writing
history
and
show
you
how
far
I
have
come
and
the
events
that
have
made
my
writing
what
it
is
today.
This
shall
probably
help
you
understand
my
predicament
in
describing
the
role
of
writing
in
my
life.
I
guess
it
goes
as
far
back
as
my
second
year
in
primary
school1
when
I
wrote
my
first
English
composition.
My
teacher
had
given
us
a
skeleton
essay
and
we
were
supposed
to
fill
in
the
blanks.
"My
best
friends
name
is
Cynthia
Muriuki...
"
it
went,
"and
she
is
my
best
friend
because
I
go
to
her
house
and
she
comes
to
mine____"
Not
an
impressive
beginning
but
I
guess
it
was
a
start
(I
still
have
a
copy
of
the
essay
at
home).
I
was
very
excited
because
I
was
now
grown-up
enough
to
write
an
essay,
but
this
elation
soon
fazed
out
when
I
realized
that
I
had
to
write
an
essay
a
week.
I
enjoyed
the
part
of
it
where
we
would
write
about
imaginary
things,
like
what
I
would
do
if
I
won
the
lottery,
or
what
I
did
during
my
Christmas
break
(which
I
interpreted
as
what
I
wished
I
had
done
during
the
break).
However,
when
it
came
to
writing
facts,
my
pleasure
for
writing
ceased
there.
By
the
time
I
reached
fourth
grade,
I
used
to
read
detective
and
mystery
books
that
gave
me
wild
ideas
for
my
essays
(and
my
teacher
did
not
quite
appreciate
them)
so
I
had
decided
that
I
definitely
preferred
reading
to
writing.
My
main
problem
by
this
time
was
that
we
were
not
only
supposed
to
write
an
English
essay
a
week,
but
a
Kiswahili
one
as
well!2.
I
do
not
remember
any
extraordinary
writing
experiences
in
my
primary
school,
unless
writing
"I
will
never
talk
in
class
again"
five
hundred
times,
counts.
Most
of
the
essays
by
the
time
I
reached
my
last
year
of
primary
school
were
about
what
we
did
during
the
vacation,
or
short
stories,
or
even
explaining
what
a
proverb
means
by
writing
an
essay
about
it.
By
this
time,
the
approximate
length
for
an
essay
was
500
words
(which
we
had
to
count
manually!!).
One
thing
I
remember
about
writing
essays
in
primary
school
was
that
we
could
only
use
pencils
to
write
them
so
that
if
we
made
a
mistake,
we
could
easily
correct
it.
My
first
year
in
high
school
revealed
to
me
that
my
primary
school
English
teacher
had
not
done
a
good
job
in
explaining
to
me
the
art
of
writing
essays
(or
so
my
high
school
teacher
said).
For
one,
an
essay
was
not
an
essay
unless
it
was
more
than
two
pages
long,
and
she
made
it
clear
that
pencils
were
used
by
grade
school
children
and
not
high
school
students.
She
also
gave
us
a
long
list
of
rules
about
writing
essays,
none
of
which
I
can
remember.
I
did
eventually
get
a
more
flexible
English
teacher
by
the
time
I
got
to
my
second
year
of
high
school
and
I
remember
one
particular
essay
I
wrote
entitled
'Jeremiad'.
I
do
not
remember
exactly
what
the
essay
was
about,
I
think
it
was
about
the
trials
of
a
street
kid.
However,
I
do
remember
reading
the
dictionary
(yes,
actually
reading
the
dictionary)
and
finding
this
word
which
I
decided
had
to
be
the
title
of
my
essay.
It
was
the
first
essay
I
had
done
and
felt
very
proud
of,
I
even
think
it
had
a
chance
in
the
essay
writing
competitions
that
were
so
popular
at
that
time.
My
teacher
was
so
impressed
by
the
essay,
in
fact
she
remembered
that
particular
composition
for
as
long
as
I
was
in
high
school.
The
only
problem
was
that
she
did
not
return
it
to
me
and
that
was
the
only
copy
I
had
made
(we
still
used
to
write
essays
by
hand
so
multiple
copies
of
essays
were
next
to
impossible
to
do
--
this
time
we
wrote
in
ink
and
not
pencil!)
So
that
was
the
story
of
my
first
impressive
essay
I
ever
wrote.
In
high
school,
we
learnt
how
to
write
practically
every
imaginable
form
of
writing.
We
were
taught
how
to
write
reports,
memoranda,
applications,
minutes,
newspaper
articles,
poems,
according
to
me
at
the
time,
far
beyond
what
I
needed
to
know
and
a
total
waste
of
time.
However
when
I
came
to
college
I
appreciated
all
that
I
had
learnt
especially
when
it
came
to
writing
laboratory
reports
and
weekly
memoranda
to
my
professors.
They
were
also
confusing
because
we
learnt
how
to
write
the
same
things
in
Kiswahili
and
their
formats
were
different
in
each
language.
I
remember
in
one
of
my
Kiswahili
exams
I
had
to
write
minutes
for
a
meeting
and
I
ended
up
writing
them
in
the
format
that
the
English
teacher
had
taught
us.
This
was
not
the
only
time
that
I
had
confused
the
different
formats
for
two
languages
but
things
became
most
confusing
when
I
added
French
to
the
languages
that
I
took
in
high
school.
Luckily,
no
major
catastrophe
occurred
during
my
final
exam.
I
managed
to
figure
out
which
format
went
with
which
language.
Something
else
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
was
writing
poems.
There
were
days
when
I
would
suddenly
feel
the
urge
to
write
a
poem
and
I
would
quickly
grab
a
pen
and
jot
it
down.
I
have
not
had
those
impulses
of
late
but
I
still
enjoy
reading
poems
and
quotations
from
great
thinkers,
unlike
myself.
During
my
high
school
final
exam3,
I
remember
writing
another
very
good
paper.
We
were
given
the
last
paragraph
of
an
essay
and
were
supposed
to
write
an
essay
based
on
that
ending.
I
remember
feeling
a
rush
of
information
for
this
one
essay,
and
it
really
paid
of
because
I
got
an
A
in
that
course.
My
next
writing
assignment
(apart
from
writing
class
notes)
was
my
college
application.
Those
stressful
days
continue
to
haunt
me
today.
I
had
never
written
anything
about
myself,
apart
from
the
journal
I
kept,
and
that
was
different
since
I
was
the
only
one
who
read
it!
So,
I
really
tried
to
come
up
with
something
creative
but
it
was
just
not
happening.
The
worst
thing
is
that
we
had
no
computer
at
home4
so
I
had
to
write
and
revise
everything
by
hand.
I
finally
came
up
with
something
(nothing
worth
writing
about
in
this
paper)
but
at
least
it
got
me
to
college.
I
thought
I
had
gotten
the
worst
of
it
when
I
finished
my
college
application
and
since
I
knew
I
would
be
an
engineer,
I
had
finished
everything
to
do
with
writing
long
papers
or
essays.
That
was
before
I
saw
the
course
catalogue
which
said
that
I
had
to
take
a
writing
course
in
my
first
semester.
The
courses
looked
very
appealing,
I
even
had
trouble
choosing
the
one
I
wanted
to
take.
I
ended
up
taking
a
course
I
had
been
interested
in
so
that
was
a
positive
step.
I
was
excited
about
the
course
because
we
had
to
read
many
books,
most
of
which
ended
up
being
very
interesting
and
a
genre
that
I
would
not
have
read
were
it
not
for
this
class.
We
had
to
do
weekly
evaluations
of
the
class
and
this
is
what
introduced
me
to
the
computer.
I
will
never
forget
the
horrors
I
went
through
teaching
myself
how
to
use
a
Word
Processor.
I
particularly
remember
my
first
major
paper,
I
had
finished
writing
the
first
draft
on
the
day
before
it
was
due,
so
I
printed
it
out
to
check
for
errors.
The
following
day
I
went
to
correct
the
spelling,
grammar
and
other
problems
I
had
found
in
it
and
lo
and
behold,
I
could
not
open
my
file.
Apparently,
I
have
saved
it
using
an
'illegal'
name
(there
was
a
space
in
filename)
so
the
computer
could
not
recognize
it
as
a
valid
computer
file.
I
tried
everything
I
could,
I
called
the
computer
proctor
who
had
no
idea
what
to
do.
I
finally
decided
to
skip
all
my
morning
classes
to
retype
the
whole
paper
from
the
draft
I
had
previously
printed
out
and
gave
it
in
before
the
noon
deadline.
That
was
not
the
end
of
my
computer
problems.
The
other
time,
I
was
writing
a
weekly
evaluation
and
then
I
did
something
(I
still
do
not
know
what)
wrong
in
the
middle
of
writing
the
paper
and
the
computer
simply
froze.
I
was
forced
to
reboot
the
computer
but
I
had
not
saved
the
paper.
So,
once
again,
I
had
to
type
everything
out,
and
this
time
from
memory
not
from
some
printed
draft.
I
must
confess
I
am
glad
that
these
problems
occurred
at
that
time
because
I
now
avoid
them
as
much
as
possible.
One
of
my
better
papers
in
college
was
also
the
one
I
had
the
hardest
time
writing.
It
was
supposed
to
be
a
Freudian
analysis
of
a
dream
I
was
supposed
to
have
had.
To
start
with,
from
the
time
we
were
given
the
assignment,
all
forms
of
dreams
vanished
from
my
nights.
As
the
due
date
for
the
paper
approached,
I
reconciled
myself
to
the
fact
that
I
would
have
to
use
some
old
dream
most
of
which
I
had
forgotten
by
then
and
the
dream
I
remembered
had
no
sexual
nuances
(as
we
are
supposed
to
look
for
according
to
Freud).
I
also
consider
myself
reserved
and
the
thought
of
analyzing
my
dream
and
handing
that
analysis
to
some
Writing
Associate
was
not
very
fascinating.
Finally
I
reconciled
myself
to
the
fact
that
I
would
have
to
write
a
good
paper
and
if
that
meant
writing
everything
about
myself,
I
would
do
it.
Writing
the
first
paragraph
was
the
most
difficult
but
after
that,
everything
just
seemed
to
flow.
I
did
not
think
of
it
as
such
a
great
paper
but
my
writing
associate
and
professor
thought
it
was
something
very
nice,
so
I
guess
it
was!
The
rest
of
my
papers
for
that
class
went
very
well.
That
professor
really
gave
me
a
boost
and
made
me
start
feeling
really
good
about
my
writing.
I
think
it
was
because
of
her
encouragement
that
I
did
very
well
in
that
class
and
was
therefore
exempted
from
the
First
Year
Writing
course.
The
other
writing
experiences
I
had
during
my
first
semester
were
technical
lab
reports
that
I
found
a
bit
tedious
because
they
were
just
a
copy
of
what
I
had
told
my
professor
during
the
lab.
I
had
no
writing
course
during
my
Spring
semester
and
I
partly
regret
that
because
I
feel
as
if
my
writing
has
really
deteriorated.
I
wrote
only
one
paper
for
my
Government
course
and
I
think
it
was
a
very
good
paper
because
it
was
about
something
that
hit
quite
close
to
home.
It
was
about
the
role
of
the
United
Nations
in
Africa
and
I
specifically
dealt
with
its
role
in
my
neighboring
countries,
Somalia
and
Rwanda.
My
professor
was
really
impressed
with
the
paper
but
since
that
was
the
only
paper
I
did,
it
did
not
give
me
much
practice.
I
also
think
that
the
lack
of
practice
is
my
fault
because
I
stopped
keeping
a
journal
when
I
came
to
college.
I
remember
faithfully
writing
long
pages
of
what
had
been
going
on
in
my
life
when
I
was
back
home.
The
last
entry
was
dated
the
day
I
flew
into
the
United
States.
My
lack
of
practice
clearly
revealed
itself
in
a
paper
I
did
at
the
end
of
the
semester.
The
paper
was
supposed
to
exempt
me
from
some
introduction
to
Anthropology
courses
so
that
I
could
take
an
advanced
course.
I
was
supposed
to
read
two
chapters
of
two
books
and
compare
and
contrast
their
contents.
I
have
never
felt
so
bad
about
a
paper
I
had
ever
written.
It
was
so
bad
that
I
bet
the
professor
must
have
felt
sorry
for
me
when
he
found
out
that
the
author
of
that
paper
wanted
to
take
a
course
with
him.
I
suppose
that
paper
is
responsible
for
my
attitude
toward
writing
at
this
time.
I
felt
like
giving
him
an
old
paper
I
had
written
and
telling
him
that
I
could
really
do
much
better.
I
did
get
to
take
the
course
and
I
proved
to
him
that
I
was
not
as
unintelligent
as
I
seemed
to
be
initially.
Writing
this
paper
has
really
brought
back
memories
of
my
old
teachers,
some
who
thought
that
I
was
not
really
cut
out
to
write
well,
others
who
played
a
huge
role
in
encouraging
me
and
making
me
feel
like
I
could
really
make
it.
Still,
it
has
not
convinced
me
or
explained
to
me,
my
relationship
with
writing.
However,
one
thing
is
for
sure,
I
do
enjoy
reading
(although
I
was
not
supposed
to
mention
anything
about
reading
in
this
paper).
