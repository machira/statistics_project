Narrative
Assignment
August
28,
1995
Prior
to
this
narrative
I
never
really
thought
about
the
evolution
of
my
writing
process.
Although
I
did
recall
certain
memories
about
my
school
years
and
writing
assignments
I
never
thought
about
how
those
incidents
shaped
my
writing
process
and
made
me
the
writer
I
am
today.
Now
that
I
am
writing
this
paper,
I
find
that
these
incidents
did
shape
my
writing
style
in
a
very
definite
way.
The
earliest
memory
I
have
of
writing
is
when
I
was
in
the
fifth
grade.
I
remember
I
was
given
a
report
to
do
on
Benjamin
Franklin.
When
I
went
home
and
told
my
dad,
he
was
quite
excited
since
he
is
a
history
buff.
When
it
came
time
for
me
to
show
my
completed
paper
to
my
father
he
seemed
very
displeased.
He
told
me
that
my
information
about
Benjamin
Franklin
was
good
but
that
my
presentation
was
poor.
I
asked
him
what
he
meant
by
this
and
he
then
asked
if
I
looked
the
paper
over
before
giving
it
to
him
to
read.
I
told
him
that
I
did
not.
He
then
told
me
that
there
were
a
bunch
of
careless
errors
that
I
would
have
found
had
I
read
the
paper
before
giving
it
to
him.
I
explained
to
him
that
my
teacher,
whose
name
was
Mrs.
Koshar,
told
the
class
that
the
most
important
thing
was
just
to
get
it
down.
This
concept
infuriated
my
dad.
He
is
usually
a
person
who
thinks
things
out
for
a
very
long
time
and
always
works
at
a
job
until
he
thinks
he
has
reached
perfection.
So
this
concept
of
just
get
it
down
really
irritated
him.
For
years
I
heard
my
father
quote
Mrs.
Koshar
in
a
sarcastic
manner.
For
example,
this
past
winter
while
I
was
writing
my
resume,
my
father
snuck
up
behind
me
and
glanced
over
my
shoulder
to
see
what
I
was
doing.
After
a
quick
peek
at
my
jotted
notes,
he
immediately
exclaimed
Just
get
it
down,
huh?
I
never
really
thought
that
this
concept
affected
my
writing
but
now
that
I
think
about
it
I
guess
it
did.
To
this
day
I
just
get
down
my
ideas
down
and
then
I
revise
and
revise
until
I
am
satisfied
with
my
writing.
I
remember
that
during
the
fifth
grade
many
of
my
writing
assignments
were
book
reports
and
essays.
However,
during
the
sixth
grade
I
wrote
many
creative
essays.
I
remember
my
teacher
Mr.
Young
used
to
assign
various
writing
assignments
and
we
used
to
have
to
read
the
paper
aloud.
The
best
papers
were
chosen
and
the
author
of
these
papers
received
an
award
of
some
sort.
I
remember
that
this
incentive
made
me
want
to
try
hard
to
come
up
with
a
really
creative
idea.
I
guess
that's
why
when
I
write
now,
I
often
try
to
come
up
with
a
creative
way
of
presenting
my
ideas
or
an
interesting
thesis.
Mr.
Young's
emphasis
on
creativity
has
stayed
with
me
to
this
day.
When
I
entered
junior
high
school,
I
had
a
history
teacher,
Mr.
Baitz,
who
had
an
interesting
rule.
He
required
that
our
parents
read
our
papers
and
sign
them
before
we
handed
them
in.
I
guess
this
was
his
way
of
keeping
parents
up-to-date
with
their
child's
progress.
In
the
beginning
of
the
year,
I
felt
uncomfortable
showing
my
writing
to
my
parents,
especially
since
my
dad
would
often
make
comments
about
just
getting
it
down.
However,
as
the
year
progressed,
I
found
this
technique
useful;
it
made
me
more
confident
in
what
I
was
handing
in
to
Mr.
Baitz.
To
this
day,
I
often
have
my
friends
review
my
writing,
sometimes
to
the
extent
of
actual
peer
editing
with
pen
in
hand.
I
find
this
helpful
because
it
allows
me
to
catch
those
careless
errors
my
father
hated
so
much
as
well
as
make
sure
my
thoughts
are
clear
to
someone
who
might
not
be
as
familiar
with
the
subject
matter
as
I
am.
When
I
was
a
senior
in
high
school,
we
often
had
to
write
papers
on
the
books
we
read
in
AP
English.
I
had
English
class
third
period,
and
a
study
hall
second
period.
I
remember
that
I
had
often
procrastinated
starting
these
papers,
and
would
come
into
school
on
the
morning
one
was
due
without
having
started
it.
I
would
sit
down
in
study
hall
and
write
my
paper
without
making
a
rough
draft
or
getting
my
thoughts
down
first.
I
would
scribble
madly,
hoping
that
I
would
not
make
any
spelling
errors
or
need
to
cross
anything
out,
and
trying
to
get
5
pages
out
of
my
pen
in
the
43
minutes
of
study
hall.
This
was
very
difficult
for
me;
as
I
have
already
said,
I
usually
make
notes
and
revise
repeatedly.
I
realized
that
whatever
personal
time
I
had
gained
by
not
working
on
my
paper
earlier
was
not
worth
the
difficulty
this
added
to
my
writing.
Now
I
always
allow
myself
time
for
my
rather
lengthy
writing
style.
Prior
to
going
away
to
college,
I
thought
a
lot
about
what
the
college
work
would
be
like.
I
remember
watching
an
episode
of
Family
Ties
where
Alex
Keaton
pulled
an
all-nighter
in
order
to
complete
a
college
essay.
I
worried
that
this
would
become
a
common
occurrence
in
my
life,
too.
Would
I
be
able
to
handle
the
college
workload?
When
I
received
my
first
writing
assignment
in
my
freshman
English
class,
the
transition
was
made
much
smoother
by
my
professor.
She
understood
that
we
were
all
fearful
of
the
academic
changes
we
were
going
through,
and
made
every
effort
to
help
us.
She
gave
very
clear
assignments,
letting
us
know
specifically
what
she
expected
of
us.
She
would
sit
down
with
each
student
individually
after
a
paper
was
graded
so
that
we
understood
her
comments
completely
and
could
improve
our
writing
for
the
next
time.
I've
always
been
a
person
who
needed
to
know
what
was
expected
of
me;
her
clear
explanations
made
me
feel
less
intimidated
by
the
college
atmosphere.
The
other
big
change
that
came
in
college
was
the
introduction
of
a
computer
to
my
writing
process.
Prior
to
arriving
at
college,
the
majority
of
my
papers
were
handwritten.
This
made
my
revising
process
quite
difficult
and
tedious.
With
a
computer
and
the
ability
to
cut
and
paste,
I
found
a
new
dimension
for
my
writing.
My
revision
process
became
much
easier,
and
also
much
more
important.
Because
it
is
now
so
simple
to
make
revisions,
I
am
much
more
conscious
of
fine
tuning
my
paper.
I
now
finish
my
papers
a
few
days
in
advance,
just
so
that
I
can
maximize
my
revision
time.
Along
with
changes
to
my
personal
style,
college
brought
changes
to
the
actual
body
of
my
papers.
One
point
that
was
emphasized
again
and
again
through
my
high
school
years
was
that
the
conclusion
of
your
paper
should
always
echo
the
introduction,
summing
up
the
points
discussed
in
the
paper.
In
college,
the
conclusion
is
a
more
sophisticated
idea;
often
the
introduction
of
a
new
yet
related
point
or
a
question
for
the
reader
to
ponder
rather
than
a
simple
restatement
of
the
introduction.
This
is
something
that
I
struggle
with
even
after
3
full
years
of
college;
it
was
ingrained
in
me
so
deeply
by
my
high
school
teachers
that
it
is
hard
to
change
it
now.
As
I
review
my
thoughts
for
this
paper,
I
find
that
one
main
point
has
surfaced
as
having
an
influence
on
my
writing
over
the
years
--
my
rewrite
process.
Whether
I
was
denying
myself
the
opportunity
to
rewrite
and
suffering
for
it,
or
letting
this
method
of
writing
develop
further,
it
has
always
been
a
large
part
of
my
style.
Perhaps
this
is
the
reason
that
I
enjoy
being
a
Writing
Associate.
I
am
sensitive
to
the
need
to
rewrite,
and
to
how
difficult
this
can
be
at
times.
I
enjoy
being
involved
in
another
student's
work
in
progress
as
much
as
in
my
own.
For
me,
the
time
spent
in
rewriting
is
the
most
important
time
I
put
into
a
paper,
so
I
am
glad
to
help
a
student
through
this
time
in
their
work.
I
guess
Mrs.
Koshar
was
wrong;
there
are
more
important
things
in
life
than
just
getting
it
down.
