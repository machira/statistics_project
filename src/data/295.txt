My
Literary
Narrative:
A
Chronological
History
of
My
Experiences
with
Writing
Workshop
Project
W.A.
Program
Fall
2001
When
I
try
to
remember
my
first
significant
experiences
with
writing,
the
memories
are
suprisingly
blurry.
I
have
no
defining
moment
in
my
early
years
when
I
decided
that
I
enjoyed
writing,
or
that
I
wanted
to
be
a
writer
myself.
I
think
my
writing
has
just
always
been
an
extension
of
my
kind-of
unusually
romantic
and
thought-filled
mind-
it's
been
a
way
for
me
to
express
myself.
Interestingly
though,
I've
never
wanted
to
express
myself
to
anyone
else.
I've
used
writing
for
personal,
almost
organizational
purposes.
Transforming
my
thoughts
into
language,
recording
the
words,
and
being
able
to
look
back
on
them
has
allowed
me
to
revisit
the
thoughts
and
questions
that
I've
found
important
and
meaningful
in
my
life.
My
first
memories
of
writing
are
from
my
earliest
years
of
school
when
we
would
have
to
draw
pictures
and
create
stories
to
go
along
with
them.
I
would
make
these
somewhat
abstract
pictures
and
equally
"interesting"
accompanying
stories.
My
classmates
thought
they
were
"weird"
and
my
teacher
looked
unhappy
while
she
told
my
parents
they
were,
"well,
unique".
I
remember
loving
Aesop's
fables,
and
I
think
I
would
try
to
emulate
his
somewhat
bizarre
tales
of
talking
elephants
and
morally
upstanding
beetles.
Judging
by
people's
reactions,
I
figured
they
were
too
bizarre,
and
I
suppose
this
was
the
early
beginning
of
my
feeling
that
there
was
a
definite
"right"
and
"wrong"
way
to
write,
and
that
I
often
got
it
wrong.
In
between
these
stories
and
my
next
significant
memory
of
writing,
I
remember
an
abundance
of
geometrical
shape
games,
math
problems,
and
science
experiments.
I
don't
offhand
remember
a
single
book
I
read,
or
any
meaningful
writing
experiences.
In
5th
grade
I
had
a
teacher
that
I
will
only
call
"liberal",
and
with
little
trouble,
a
group
of
my
classmates
and
I
somehow
convinced
him
that
he
should
let
us
skip
the
two
periods
devoted
to
"Language
Arts"
and
sit
in
the
hall,
and
write
our
own
play.
We
spent
two
periods
every
day
for
half
of
the
year
in
the
hall,
and
we
probably
spent
only
2
weeks
of
that
time
actually
writing
the
play.
When
it
came
time
to
perform
it,
we
were
terribly
unprepared
and
our
performance
lasted
only
5
minutes
or
something
ridiculous
like
that.
I
remember
that
the
embarrassment
of
such
outright
laziness
was
so
uncomfortable
that
I've
tried
to
avoid
it
whenever
faced
with
writing
ever
since.
The
next
progression
in
my
writing
history
I
remember
quite
vividly.
In
6th
grade,
I
was
once
again
made
an
exception,
as
my
parents
and
teachers
had
decided
that
while
the
rest
of
the
class
was
to
be
involved
in
their
"Language
Arts"
lessons,
I
was
going
to
be
separated,
and
allowed
time
to
write
on
my
own.
At
first,
I
was
upset
and
a
little
embarrassed
about
it
-
at
that
age
I
loathed
being
separated
from
the
group.
Admittedly,
I
felt
better
about
it
when
I
went
to
the
bookstore
and
was
allowed
to
pick
out
a
gorgeous
journal
with
a
thick
fabric
cover.
I
remember
running
my
hands
along
the
tight
cloth,
slowly
opening
the
book
of
crisp,
blank
pages,
and
feeling
like
a
true
writer
(whatever
that
meant).
I
even
began
to
feel
proud
of
my
privileges,
as
my
classmates
would
express
their
jealousy
of
me
being
able
to
leave
class.
Alone
in
the
hall,
I
would
write
whatever
came
to
mind.
I
had
no
assignments,
no
supervision,
and
essentially
was
given
a
chance
to
explore
my
creative
side.
When
I
look
back
on
this
journal
(I
still
have
it)
I
like
to
think
that
I
can
see
a
transformation
in
my
writing.
The
first
pages
are
graced
by
somewhat
imitative
stories
on
topics
that
I
had
probably
read
about
in
class
(slavery,
childhood
adventure,
etc.),
but
gradually
more
original
stories
that
seem
to
have
my
creative
forces
underlying
them
emerge.
I
created
characters
with
feelings,
I
arranged
them
in
complex
relationships,
and
put
them
through
interesting
sequences.
Looking
back,
I
can
still
relate
to
the
feelings,
questions,
and
dreams
of
many
of
my
characters
in
these
later
stories.
I
think
this
is
when
I
started
to
find
an
identity
as
a
writer,
and
when
I
started
to
identify
myself
as
a
writer.
After
all,
I
was
allowed
to
leave
class
to
write,
people
I
respected
liked
what
I
wrote,
and
I
loved
to
do
it.
My
next
transformation
came
a
year
later,
when
I
began
to
comprehend
that
I
would
not
always
have
such
choice
in
what
I
was
supposed
to
write.
I
started
getting
more
in-depth
research
reports
on
things
like
"social
politics"
and
the
tapeworm
(yes,
I
got
stuck
explaining
tapeworm
to
my
fellow
classmates).
I
found
that
writing
had
now
become
more
work
than
it
was
fun.
Before,
writing
had
been
a
very
personal
and
imaginative
process
for
me,
and
all
of
sudden
I
had
to
research
fact,
and
make
sure
I
got
everything
"right".
Even
worse,
I
had
to
concentrate
on
things
like
grammar
that
I
had
never
been
forced
to
address
before.
I
probably
would
have
given
up
my
interest
in
writing,
had
it
not
been
for
my
English
teacher
that
year.
She
introduced
me
to
an
aspect
of
writing
that
had
never
been
a
big
part
of
my
education
-
the
language
and
calculated
composition
of
it.
Although
now
I
can
hardly
remember
the
exact
exercises
we
would
do,
I
do
remember
that
she
made
the
process
of
putting
words
together
really
interesting!
Suddenly
I
found
all
these
choices
at
my
disposal
-
did
I
want
that
word
or
this
word?
Did
I
want
to
put
a
paragraph
here,
or
there?
Writing
was
becoming
more
than
just
putting
my
ideas
on
paper.
It
became
this
sort-of
artful
exercise
of
my
mind,
and
to
this
day,
this
is
still
how
I
think
of
it.
The
good
thing
about
getting
this
new
glimpse
of
writing
was
that
it
could
span
all
the
types
of
writing
I
was
being
asked
to
do.
Formulating
a
comprehensible
piece
of
writing
in
this
new
way
(a
way
that
luckily
amused
me)
I
found
it
easier
to
write
for
those
classes
that
had
previously
discouraged
me.
At
the
same
time,
I
think
I
was
learning
to
control
the
creative
urges
I
felt
while
writing
-
learning
when
to
use
them
and
when
to
quiet
them.
Now
that
I
had
begun
conquering
non-fiction,
the
next
area
for
my
growth
as
a
writer
was
the
autobiographical.
That
spring,
I
was
selected
along
with
one
other
child
in
my
grade
to
enter
a
national
writing
contest,
but
first
we
had
to
have
a
write-off
between
us
to
see
who
would
be
chosen
to
enter.
It
was
an
incredibly
stressful
situation,
and
one
that
I
remember
with
much
clarity.
We
sat,
the
two
of
us
facing
each
other,
and
were
given
the
topic,
and
a
tight
time
limit.
I
sat
and
read
the
question
over
and
over
again,
while
he
scribbled
away.
I
had
come
prepared
to
whip
up
some
cleverly
creative
piece
of
fiction,
and
instead
found
myself
faced
with
a
question
that
inquired
about
some
personal
experience
and
how
it
had
affected
my
life.
Unfortunately,
my
self
was
an
area
that
I
had
never
really
written
about.
I
could
create
a
character
without
a
moments
hesitation
if
need
be,
and
I
could
create
some
journey
for
that
character
to
go
on,
but
to
talk
about
myself,
candidly,
and
to
talk
about
a
journey/had
taken,
was
nearly
impossible.
So,
I
did
the
only
thing
I
knew
how
to
do,
and
created
a
fictional
character
that
had
had
endured
some
witty
experience,
and
talked
about
her
in
the
first
person.
Somehow
it
must
have
sounded
realistic
enough
-I
won
the
face
off
and
submitted
some
more
fiction.
Soon,
I
found
out
that
I
was
one
of
the
state
winners
and
whether
I
like
to
admit
it
or
not,
it's
still
one
of
my
shining
moments
as
a
writer.
I
like
to
think
that
the
uncomfortable
guilt
that
I
feel
whenever
I
think
of
my
inability
to
write
about
myself
that
day
has
contributed
to
my
current
devotion
to
exploring
myself
through
writing.
The
next
year,
8th
grade,
brought
an
interesting
and
vitally
important
time
in
the
history
of
my
writing.
I
went
into
the
year
straight
off
of
my
national
contest
win,
and
admittedly
I
had
a
somewhat
big-headed
approach
to
my
English
class
that
year.
Within
the
first
week
I
was
knocked
off
my
high
horse,
and
brought
back
to
the
ground.
My
teacher
(a
self-proclaimed
intellectual)
had
assigned
Kafka's
The
Trial
and
Camus'
The
Stranger
in
an
attempt
to
help
us
fully
understand
existentialism.
I
must
say,
he
had
rather
lofty
expectations
of
us,
and
I
know
that
I
wasn't
alone
in
my
confusion
with
the
material.
Though
I
can't
say
I
grasped
much
about
existentialism,
what
such
an
introduction
to
intellectual
writing
did,
was
give
me
both
an
intense
respect
for
these
writers
that
I
found
incomprehensible,
and
a
passionate
yearning
to
one
day
be
able
to
understand
them.
Both
this
yearning
to
be
able
to
understand
and
create
such
intellectual
writing,
and
the
respect
for
people
that
can
do
it,
have
stayed
planted
deeply
within
me.
As
if
this
teacher
had
not
frustrated
me
enough
by
trying
to
make
me
into
a
12-year-old
existential
guru,
he
introduced
me
to
one
of
the
most
important
parts
of
the
writing
process
-
revision.
I
was
used
to
writing
something
and
immediately
considering
it
a
finished
piece.
When
I
sat
down
to
write,
I
expected
to
be
done
in
the
very
near
future.
I
didn't
want
to
have
to
rethink
anything,
as
thinking
about
it
for
the
first
time
was
hard
enough.
I
found
it
terribly
frustrating
to
have
to
look
for
any
room
for
improvement,
and
found
it
much
easier
to
not
look
at
it
again
and
assume
it
was
decent.
This,
however,
was
not
going
to
fly,
for
this
teacher
had
"The
Revision
Policy".
Essentially,
the
policy
allowed
us
to
rewrite
any
piece
that
got
a
grade
that
was
either
unsatisfactory
to
him,
or
unsatisfactory
to
us,
for
a
chance
at
a
better
grade.
The
catch
was
that
unless
we
had
written
a
paper
that
was
eligible
for
a
Pulitzer
Prize
Award,
he
would
give
us
a
horrible
mark
on
it,
and
we
would
inevitably
have
to
tackle
it
for
revision.
Then,
submitting
it
to
him
once
more,
he
would
give
only
a
slightly
better
grade,
and
we
would
again
have
little
choice
but
to
rewrite
it
again.
This
would
go
on
until
we
had
reached
a
decent
grade,
or
until
we
had
already
been
assigned
something
else.
Although
the
process
was
tedious
and
frustrating
to
say
the
least,
I
am
grateful
for
having
had
to
go
through
it.
I
learned
to
reassess
my
work,
and
I
learned
how
to
recognize
weaknesses
in
it.
Above
all,
I
learned
that
the
first
draft
of
writing
is
(at
least
for
me)
often
tremendously
far
from
being
the
best
it
can
be,
and
that
revision
can
often
be
the
most
challenging,
but
yet
the
most
rewarding
part
of
writing.
When
I
can
say
that
a
piece
of
writing
is
finished
-
when
I
can
say
that
there
is
no
other
change
that
I
would
want
to
make
-1
am
the
most
happy.
That
is
the
most
fun
for
me
-
being
able
to
look
back
and
read
something
that,
to
me,
is
perfect.
Assuredly,
this
has
been
a
seldom
occurrence
so
far,
and
one
I
hope
to
be
able
to
experience
many
more
times
in
my
life
to
come.
Well,
I've
gotten
distracted
from
my
chronological
history,
something
that
probably
isn't
the
best
sign
of
good
writing,
so,
quickly
on
to
my
high
school
experience.
I
was
taking
hard
classes,
most
of
them
science
and
math,
and
even
though
they
weren't
terribly
enjoyable,
they
were
a
priority
to
everybody
around
me
-
my
teachers,
my
parents,
and
my
peers.
For
most
of
my
high
school
career
I
was
one
of
the
very
small
minority
of
girls
in
my
classes.
I
was
surrounded
by
incredibly
(and
intimidatingly)
bright
boys
who
had
apparently
found
physics
interesting
when
they
were
8
years
old,
and
now
did
organic
chemistry
in
their
spare
time.
I
wanted
very
much
to
be
associated
with
the
intellectual
air
that
I
saw
surrounding
these
science
and
math-oriented
intellects.
It
wasn't
until
junior
year
when
my
deep
respect
for
writers
was
revitalized.
I
took
an
AP
language
class
that
dealt
with
just
that
-
the
language
used
in
writing
and
its
effects
on
a
reader.
I
fervently
studied
different
writing
styles,
eagerly
identifying
the
usage
of
sound
and
meter,
repetition
and
rhythm,
while
trying
to
understand
the
impact
these
words
had
on
the
images
in
my
mind,
and
the
emotions
somewhere
deeper.
Taking
such
a
different
look
into
the
behind-the-scenes
creation
of
writing
helped
me
to
understand
it
at
a
whole
new
level.
My
view
of
writing
as
an
"artful
exercise
of
my
mind"
was
strengthened.
Senior
year
I
took
an
AP
World
Literature
class
that
discussed
the
different
types
of
writing
(short
prose,
persuasive
essay,
poems,
etc.)
and
the
diversity
of
the
writers
that
wrote
them
in
great
depth.
My
understanding
of
writing
was
expanding
from
a
narrow
comprehension
of
fiction
to
comprehension
of
various
writings
such
as
propaganda
pieces
and
memoirs.
My
confidence
in
my
knowledge
of
writing
increased,
and
I
found
myself
going
to
Lafayette
relatively
unworried
about
the
writing
I
would
have
to
do.
Instead,
I
was
dreading
the
heavy
load
of
science
courses
that
I
still
felt
were
necessary.
Amongst
all
of
the
science
and
math
that
filled
my
freshman
year,
my
FYS
was
a
much-needed
refuge.
I
found
the
seminar's
material
incredibly
interesting,
and
found
myself,
for
perhaps
only
the
third
or
fourth
time
in
my
life,
fully
involved
in
a
course.
My
writing
abilities
proved
adequate,
and
after
working
closely
with
my
professor
on
many
aspects
of
my
writing,
she
recommended
me
to
be
a
Writing
Associate.
I
was
flattered
to
say
the
least,
but
didn't
feel
quite
ready
for
the
job.
After
placing
out
of
writing
110
with
AP
high
school
marks,
I
wound
up
taking
two
more
English
courses
in
sophomore
year.
I
looked
at
them
as
gifts
to
myself,
because
I
enjoyed
them
so
much.
When
I
look
back
at
the
two
years
at
Lafayette
that
I
have
already
completed,
I
realize
that
writing
has
been
a
necessity
all
the
way.
I
have
learned
to
write
for
a
variety
of
subjects
ranging
from
biology
and
psychology
to
philosophy
and
politics.
Still,
English
courses
seem
to
be
where
my
heart
is,
and
I've
finally
come
to
not
only
accept
it,
but
be
grateful
for
it.
I've
found
myself
faced
with
two
questions
-
whether
writing
is
something
I
can
do
well,
and
whether
writing
is
something
I
want
to
devote
my
life
to.
Regardless,
I
know
I
still
have
much
room
to
grow
as
a
writer.
As
I
decide
how
large
a
part
writing
will
play
in
my
life,
I've
declared
English
as
my
major,
I've
applied
to
be
a
W.A.,
I've
entered
poetry
contests,
and
devoted
time
to
reading
and
studying
literature
on
my
own
time.
I
now
keep
another
journal
of
my
most
recent
writings,
and
its
pages
are
being
filled
remarkably
quickly
with
writings
ranging
from
long
ramblings,
to
carefully
worked
poems,
to
short
jottings,
all
of
which
I
review
and
contemplate
often.
Regardless
of
how
far
I
go
with
writing
professionally,
and
no
matter
whom
I
choose
to
share
my
writing
with,
I
know
I
will
always
write
for
myself.
