Lyn
Make
every
letter
perfect
so
that
Kim
will
be
impressed.
The
C
must
be
softly
curved,
almost
like
a
semi-circle
but
with
a
little
extra
curl
at
the
top.
The
a
must
be
a
slanted
oval
with
a
cute
little
tail
wagging
at
the
copycat
r's.
Two
r's
would
be
precise.
The
second
r
is
just
like
the
first,
a
short
line
with
an
arc
peering
out
like
a
worm
out
of
an
apple.
Then
the
i
is
next.
It
is
short
and
simple,
making
no
motion
except
for
the
rigid
dot
which
concurs
its
existence.
Finally,
the
e,
but
wait!
I
hear
the
crash
and
the
foam
as
the
sea
gulls
circle
about
taking
flight
after
the
waves
thunder
towards
them.
They
take
off
just
before
getting
their
feet
wet
as
my
perfectly
written
name
fades
into
the
sand
and
seeps
back
into
the
sea.
Wet
sand
drips
off
my
pointed
finger
as
I
stand,
knees
wet
at
the
foot
of
my
sandy
chalkboard.
My
sister
will
never
be
impressed.
The
first
interaction
I
had
with
writing
was
at
the
beach.
I
could
not
read.
I
could
not
write.
I
could
not
write
my
name
in
the
sand
at
the
beach.
My
sister,
who
was
two
years
older
than
me
and
in
first
grade,
could
write
anything
she
wanted
in
the
sand.
She
had
learned
how
to
read.
She
knew
how
to
print.
Now,
it
was
her
mission
to
teach
her
little
sister
everything
she
knew.
She
began
with
simple
words,
for
example,
my
name.
If
I
could
write
my
name
in
the
sand
at
age
four,
I
would
be
the
most
advanced
pre-school
student
in
Nashua,
at
least,
that
is
what
she
thought.
I
soon
realized
that
this
lesson
gave
me
the
confidence
to
conquer
larger
obstacles
in
my
writing
career.
The
cursive
language
was
next
in
my
pursuit
as
an
enlightened
child.
The
cursive
S
is
sort
of
a
squigly
looking
letter.
Its
first
motion
sweeps
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
line
on
the
page
towards
the
hyphenated
mid-section
of
the
thick
space
intended
for
a
row
of
perfect
S's.
As
it
reaches
the
top
line,
it
curves
back
into
a
loop
as
if
it
were
too
scared
to
move
on.
Slowly
creeping
down
over
its
initial
stroke,
the
S
peeks
over,
gaining
confidence,
but
its
fate
lied
behind
itself.
Finally,
the
S
slithers
back
around,
past
the
beginning.
Halt!
The
S
rigidly
hides
an
buries
itself
disguised
in
a
mask
closed
off
from
the
rest
of
the
letters.
I
do
not
like
it
I
though
to
myself,
holding
that
fat,
ugly,
yellow
pencil
in
my
hand.
I
did
not
know
why,
I
just
did
not
like
it.
My
mom's
S's
do
not
look
like
that.
Her
S's
look
like
normal
S's,
the
kind
that
a
third
grader
learning
how
to
read
and
write
in
a
loopy,
connecting
style
could
recognize.
The
design
I
was
copying
across
my
page
did
not
even
resemble
an
S,
as
far
as
I
was
concerned.
So,
I
changed
my
S's.
My
teacher
did
not
like
that.
I
did
it
anyway,
secretly
practicing
my
own
S's
in
pen,
not
with
that
dirty
old
pencil,
in
my
notebook
while
outputting
that
other
design
on
the
paper
that
I
was
to
hand
in
to
my
teacher.
I
would
never
write
an
S
in
that
silly
way
that
fit
between
the
lines
of
the
handwriting
paper.
Elementary
school
introduced
me
to
a
variety
of
new
writing
implements
and
techniques.
These
were
my
learning
years
of
exploration
and
fun.
However,
I
also
made
this
time
of
creation
into
a
devious
time
of
uncertainty.
This
was
in
part
duet
o
the
wonderful
subject
of
spelling.
The
spelling
books
I
used
in
elementary
school
were
large
white
books
with
colorful
interwoven
designs.
The
color
of
the
lines
indicated
at
which
level
a
student
could
spell.
These
books
intrigued
me
with
their
coloring
book
facades
and
their
seemingly
simple
exercises.
Place
the
correct
word
into
the
correct
sentence,
spelling
the
word
correctly,
was
the
directions
to
the
second
exercise
of
the
five
page
chapter.
This
correctness
was
easy
enough.
It
was
obvious
that
the
dog
was
not
going
to
fit
into
a
sentence
that
was
telling
of
a
person
driving
a
car.
However,
my
confidence
with
this
type
of
simple
fill
in
the
blank
began
to
crawl
away
as
my
inhibitions
about
writing
gained
full
force.
As
I
rushed
through
the
easy
exercises,
I
soon
approached
the
creative
part
of
the
chapter.
Take
sixteen
wrods
that
have
absolutely
nothing
in
common
and
strategically
place
then
into
sentences
that
make
up
a
story
that
makes
sense.
I
could
not
even
make
sense
of
these
directions.
Why
did
I
have
to
do
this?
I
ken
how
to
spell
the
words.
I
knew
how
to
use
the
words
in
sentences.
How
was
I
going
to
make
sense
out
of
these
words?
The
solution
hit
me
so
sooner
than
it
was
time
for
me
to
go
to
sleep
for
the
night.
It
was
10
o'clock
when
I
found
my
mother
sitting
in
bed
reading
a
magazine.
I
crawled
up
close
on
her
queen
size
waterbed
with
my
spelling
book
in
hand.
Mom,
I
asked
diligently.
I
need
help.
Carrie,
she
said
with
a
stern
look
on
her
face,
it
is
your
bed
time.
She
knew
what
kind
of
help
I
needed.
She
also
knew
that
I
should
have
had
my
homework
completed
before
I
watched
my
favorite
sitcoms
after
dinner.
Her
austere
expression
faded
so
she
could
aid
her
youngest
daughter
with
the
mere
task
of
being
creative.
This
was
not
the
first
time
I
had
approached
her
for
help
with
that
fill
in
the
blank
book.
It
would
not
be
the
last.
As
for
my
creative
spelling,
I
was
still
hiding
behind
my
mother's
ideas
about
how
to
make
sense
of
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I
and
S-U-P-E-R-L-A-T-I-V-E.
The
spelling
book,
which
had
attempted
to
force
me
to
use
the
right
side
of
my
brain,
became
a
faint
memory
of
the
past
as
I
moved
into
a
new
school
system
at
the
junior
high
level.
Acedemic
writing
emerged
as
a
new
genre
in
the
path
of
my
writing
career.
My
first
writing
challenge:
bulimia.
Seventh
grade
science
introduced
me
to
Mrs.
Mother
Evans.
Mother
Evans
assigned
group
projects
which
included
an
eight
to
ten
page
research
paper
and
some
sort
of
visualization
piece.
I
was
not
so
concerned
with
the
Visualization
portion
of
the
project.
However,
the
research
and
ten
pages
were
what
scared
me.
I
had
never
written
more
than
two
pages
for
one
project
before.
Fortunately,
with
two
people
in
the
group
working
on
the
paper
it
meant
only
five
pages
for
me
to
actually
write
on
bulimia.
The
clinical
definition
of
bulimia
(because
this
was
what
I
had
researched)
is
a
serious
eating
disorder.
It
looked
as
if
this
serious
eating
disorder
had
more
potential
than
my
ten
page
paper.
It
was
time
to
learn
how
to
use
the
library.
The
library
at
Hollis
Junior
High
School
was
a
large,
yellow
room
with
one
little
card
catalogue,
school
room
square
tables
and
posters
of
the
Dewi
Decimal
System
adorning
the
different
sectioned
shelving
units,
of
course,
filled
with
books.
In
the
corner
sat
Happy
Beale,
the
floppy
haired
librarian
with
oversized
glasses
and
a
blue,
ink
stained
hand.
This
is
where
I
was
going
to
learn
all
about
research
material
and
writing
a
research
paper.
Ten
pages,
that
overwhelming
number,
to
be
written
on
bulimia.
I
had
the
definition
once
I
found
an
actual
book
on
the
disorder,
not
just
an
encyclopedia.
I
was
in
junior
high.
Encyclopedias
were
no
longer
adequate
sources
for
research
papers.
Books,
magazines
and
interviews
would
only
be
acceptable
for
my
bibliography.
With
these
sources,
I
could
gain
subjects
and
break
them
down
using
an
outline.
It
was
true.
I
was
learning
how
to
write
a
research
paper
the
way
I
was
supposed
to.
Writing
research
papers
was
never
my
favorite
thing
to
do.
It
was
something
that
had
to
be
done,
though.
High
school
English
classes
would
not
let
me
escape
the
all
important
research
paper.
They
did
not
just
seep
back
into
the
sea
if
I
did
not
do
them.
This
was
something
I
could
not
even
hide
from
in
college.
My
mother's
ideas
had
somehow
disappeared
in
the
sand
when
I
moved
five
hours
away
from
home
to
college.
Once
I
was
at
college,
I
had
the
tasks
of
writing
many
more
research
papers.
Again,
I
was
in
the
position
of
not
liking
the
type
of
writing
that
I
had
to
do.
It
was
not
until
I
found
that
I
could
use
my
writing
in
a
different
form
that
I
found
out
that
I
did,
in
fact,
like
to
write.
My
First
Year
Writing
professor
encouraged
me
to
take
a
Creative
Writing
class
that
was
being
offered
my
sophomore
year.
I
was
not
sure
what
to
think,
at
first.
I
thought
I
would
give
it
a
try,
nonetheless.
You
have
to
grab
something
concrete
in
your
writing
in
order
for
the
reader
to
be
able
to
understand
fully
the
idea
you
are
trying
to
get
across.
My
professor
continuously
encourage
us
to
feel
what
we
were
writing.
If
she
was
not
able
to
feel
it,
too,
then
we
had
the
chance
to
change
it
and
improve
what
we
had
created.
I
recall
a
story
that
I
was
trying
to
create.
It
was
born
from
a
dream
that
I
had
the
night
before.
The
moment
I
woke
up
I
grabbed
my
pen
and
began
writing.
I
was
compelled
to
write
this
story.
The
excitement
of
showing
my
story
to
the
class
stirred
inside
of
me
until
the
moment
right
before
I
read
it
aloud.
The
words
flowed
out
of
my
mouth.
I
barely
read
the
words
off
the
page.
It
was
so
familiar
to
me.
The
reaction
from
my
class
was
astonishing.
They
absolutely
loved
the
idea.
The
idea.
But,
I
wanted
them
to
love
the
way
that
I
had
written
the
story.
They
did
not,
but
were
not
prepared
to
tell
me
that.
Instead,
their
creative
minds
threw
ideas
of
how
to
change
my
story
into
something
completely
different.
I
hated
that.
As
I
sat
there
listening
to
them
add
shredded
piece
of
filth
to
my
story,
my
mind
became
enraged.
I
wanted
to
tear
the
whole
thing
up,
burn
it,
just
get
rid
of
it
altogether.
There
was
one
voice,
however,
that
would
not
let
me
do
that.
That
voice
kept
telling
me
that
it
was
my
story.
Do
not
let
them
do
that
to
your
story.
It
is
yours.
Make
it
what
your
want.
They
are
just
giving
you
ideas.
You
do
not
have
to
change
a
thing.
Take
your
idea
and
make
it
yours.
I
hear
the
beautiful
sound
of
the
ocean
crashing
and
the
ugly
seagulls
sguawking
every
time
I
go
to
write.
I
find
barriers
that
break
me
up
inside.
I
find
barriers
that
tear
my
writing
to
pieces.
I
look
at
the
details
of
my
life
to
create
images
within
a
boring
piece
of
writing.
I
pick
up
my
pen
and
make
them
fire
with
light,
truth
and
heart.
I
make
them
mine.
