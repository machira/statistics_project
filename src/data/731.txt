New
WA
Narrative:
The
first
thing
that
I
remember
recording
on
paper
was
my
name.
Scrawled
in
blue
crayon,
in
a
childish
hand,
my
name
beamed
back
at
me
from
its
place
on
the
paper
with
pride.
My
later
experiences
with
writing
in
elementary
school
would
not
include
as
much
pride
as
this
first
signature
had
left
me
with.
I
was
placed
in
my
elementary
schoolOs
lowest
reading
and
writing
group
in
the
third
grade.
Being
an
avid
reader,
my
placement
in
this
group
was
a
shameful
mistake.
For
a
shy
third-grader,
I
accepted
my
fate
as
a
Nslower
readerO
and
as
a
Npoor
writerO.
My
lioness
of
a
mother
disagreed,
however,
and
arranged
for
me
to
re-take
the
dreaded
placement
test
again
and
I
was
moved
to
the
second-highest
group.
A
small,
yet
brief,
victory.
The
worst
experience
I
have
ever
had
in
my
career
as
a
writer
came
unfortunately
early,
when
I
was
in
the
fourth
grade.
In
Connecticut,
our
statewide
standardized
testing
system
came
in
the
form
of
the
CMTOs.
My
fourth
grade
class
was
prepared
by
doing
a
great
deal
of
practice
problems
and
group
exercises.
For
the
writing
portion
of
our
test
prep,
we
were
given
45
minutes
to
write
a
five-paragraph
essay,
like
the
one
that
was
going
to
be
on
the
CMT.
We
had
to
complete
this
prompt
in
an
awful
blue
book
that
could
not
contain
my
poor
handwriting.
The
prompt
we
had
been
allotted
was
to
be
a
piece
that
was
about
a
boy
who
was
left
on
his
own.
In
the
entire
45
minutes
allowed
for
the
prompt,
I
produced
one
sad
paragraph
instead
of
the
requisite
five.
My
anxiety
to
find
the
right
words
had
not
produced
any.
The
most
memorable
part
of
this
ordeal
was
that
my
teacher,
Mrs.
Brown,
read
each
prompt
(anonymously)
out
loud
to
the
class
for
constructive
criticism.
With
a
sickening
feeling
in
my
stomach,
I
crossed
my
fingers
each
time
she
picked
up
one
of
those
obnoxious
blue
books,
praying
that
she
would
somehow
miss
mine
altogether.
My
practice
prompt
was
among
the
last
to
be
read
out
loud.
The
only
sentence
that
I
can
remember
was
something
about
being
so
nervous
that
I
could
barf.
Ironic,
as
that
was
the
exact
feeling
I
had
when
well-meaning
Mrs.
Brown
finished
reading
my
sorry
paragraph.
My
classmates
were
silent
for
a
few
moments:
some
looked
as
though
they
were
suppressing
laughter.
I
avoided
looking
anyone
in
the
eye.
From
that
day
forth,
I
knew
that
the
way
people
viewed
my
writing
impacted
me
greatly.
I
acquired
a
tutor
(or
two)
and
a
whole
lot
of
confidence.
The
next
time
we
had
a
writing
prompt,
not
only
did
I
manage
to
write
the
full
five
paragraphs;
my
classmates
also
praised
my
clever
use
of
onomatopo2eia.
It
was
one
of
the
best
moments
in
my
writing
career.
My
writing
would
take
form
over
the
years
into
its
distinctive
style.
While
I
struggled
with
math
and
science,
I
soared
at
reading
comprehension
and
writing.
My
middle
school
teachers
heaped
their
praise
upon
my
excellent
skills
as
a
young
writer.
Gone
were
the
elementary
school
days
of
frustration
over
writing
a
paragraph
for
homework
and
the
struggle
to
complete
anything
that
resembled
the
stories
I
loved
to
read
about
princesses
and
young
adventurers.
While
my
writing
did
not
always
earn
AOs,
I
knew
as
long
as
I
was
thorough
with
my
work
and
somewhat
creative
with
my
prose
that
I
would
earn
a
high
mark.
I
was
fortunate
in
the
fact
that
most,
if
not
all,
of
my
middle
school
English
teachers
liked
my
style
of
writing.
When
I
entered
high
school,
this
blessing
would
not
be
the
case.
Before
beginning
high
school,
I
took
the
test
to
enter
honors
English.
All
throughout
middle
school,
all
I
had
wanted
to
do
was
place
into
honor
English.
It
would
solidify
my
writing
prowess
and
would
make
me
one
of
the
Nsmart
kidsO,
members
of
my
grade
that
seemed
to
exude
intelligence
and
confidence
in
the
world
of
academia.
Luck
was
not
on
my
side
when
I
took
the
placement
test,
and
I
missed
the
score
needed
to
enter
honors
English
by
two
points.
I
was
livid.
Tears
were
shed.
Pride
injured,
I
tried
to
reason
with
the
dragon
of
a
lady
who
ran
the
English
department
at
the
high
school,
along
with
the
help
of
my
mother.
Ms.
Fiotakas,
or
Fio
as
she
was
regarded,
was
a
lady
who
had
no
time
for
the
petty
pleas
of
an
awkward
14-year-old
and
her
enraged
mom.
Fio,
who
seemed
ancient
with
her
papery
white
skin
and
gnarled
hands,
informed
my
mother
and
myself
that
I
just
simply
would
get
lost
in
the
honors
course
material.
It
took
all
that
I
had
to
not
ask
Fio
if
it
was
chilly
during
the
Ice
Age.
My
freshman
year
at
Weston
High
School
would
be
full
of
teachers
that
were
renown
for
their
excellence,
minus
one.
The
new
English
teacher
for
standard
freshmen
English,
Ms.
Rossi,
was
not
prepared
to
teach
a
class
of
gawky
teens
at
the
end
of
the
day,
from
1:27-2:10.
She
could
barely
control
my
class;
papers
were
graded
months
after
they
were
due.
She
did
not
like
my
writing
style,
to
make
matters
even
more
unbearable.
I
knew
that
I
could
not
allow
myself
to
be
in
a
standard
English
course
in
high
school
ever
again.
I
was
in
DanteOs
5th
circle
of
Hell,
angrily
battling
the
unjust
assessment
given
to
all
of
my
hard
work.
When
it
came
time
to
take
the
placement
tests
for
sophomore
honorOs
courses,
I
rushed
to
sign
up
for
honors
English
and
History.
I
was
determined
to
not
have
another
bad
test.
I
sharpened
all
8
of
my
test
pencils
(for
good
luck
and
for
my
poor
handwriting)
and
marched
into
the
testing
room
with
10
minutes
to
spare.
The
test
for
English
was
not
challenging:
I
even
finished
with
15
minutes
to
spare.
This
made
me
worry
that
I
had
somehow
missed
something
and
I
anxiously
waited
until
the
results
of
the
test
came
back
in
time
for
course
selection
in
the
Spring.
March
rolled
around
and
I
walked
with
dread
to
my
guidance
counselor
to
determine
my
courses
for
sophomore
year.
She
slowly
opened
my
file
on
the
computer
and
popped
open
my
would-be
schedule.
I
read
through
my
classes
quickly,
scanning
for
any
honors.
Spanish
4EBiologyEGeometryEHonors
History

English

looked
at
my
guidance
counselor
as
she
babbled
on
about
how
I
was
going
to
fit
my
electives
around
my
academic
courses
but
she
abruptly
stopped
when
she
saw
the
huge
grin
on
my
face.
NWhy
are
you
so
happyE?
About
schoolE?O
I
could
only
reply
with
the
excited
exclamation
of
NI
DIDDDD
ITTTT!!!O
It
was
one
of
those
moments
that
validated,
once
again,
that
I
was
a
competent
writer.
Oh,
and
that
Fio
had
been
wrong.
Wrong,
wrong,
wrong!
I
was
smart.
A
smart
kid.
I
raced
out
of
my
guidance
counselorOs
office
at
the
end
of
our
meeting
to
my
momOs
waiting
car.
Smart
was
the
only
word
that
reverberated
through
my
conscience
as
I
jauntily
bounced
over
to
our
Suburban.
The
car
hummed
smart,
smart,
smart;
my
footsteps
echoed
the
same
notion.
I
could
barely
contain
my
excitement
as
a
practically
shouted
my
accomplishment
at
my
mom.
She
couldnOt
contain
her
pride,
or
her
tears.
It
was
this
achievement
in
my
developing
years
that
would
motivate
me
to
work
harder
and
would
again
reiterate
how
much
pride
I
took
in
my
written
work.
As
a
shy
girl,
my
writing
became
my
voice,
my
closeted
personality.
My
writing
gave
me
a
great
many
chances
to
shine.
During
my
last
two
years
at
Weston
High
School,
my
junior
and
senior
year
AP
English
teachers
would
impact
my
writing
the
most.
My
junior
year
English
teacher
would
come
in
the
form
of
Ms.
Julia
Hollins.
Ms.
Hollins
could
have
been
a
relative
of
Ms.
Trunchbull
from
Matilda.
She
was
older,
heavyset,
and
had
ankles
that
were
perpetually
swollen.
She
went
to
a
school
in
New
Haven,
Connecticut,
from
the
affectionate
way
she
talked
about
it,
I
initially
assumed
that
she
had
attended
Yale.
I
later
would
scold
myself
for
being
so
stupid,
as
Yale
most
certainly
would
not
have
graduated
a
teacher
as
horrible
as
her.
We
were
often
given
reading
assignments
that
did
not
pertain
to
anything
that
related
to
the
AP
course
of
study
we
were
given.
There
was
barely
any
talk
of
rhetoric
or
the
intricacies
of
the
written
language.
For
a
week
straight
we
watched
The
Graduate.
We
had
to
read
The
Great
Gatsby
on
our
own
with
barely
any
discussion
and
we
had
to
answer
pointless
questions
about
Huckleberry
Finn.
The
first
dreaded
writing
prompt
she
assigned
was
a
timed
one
during
class.
Those
dreaded
blue
books
came
out;
she
glared
at
me
as
I
took
my
second
book
to
accommodate
my
poor
handwriting.
I
finished
the
prompt
late,
harried
in
my
rush
to
make
everything
look
neat.
We
were
handed
back
the
graded
prompt
a
month
later.
The
grade
we
received
was
out
of
10.
I
got
a
5.
A
5.
Tears
sprang
into
my
eyes.
I
didnOt
know
what
was
worse,
the
grade
itself
or
the
fact
that
there
was
no
explanation
for
such
a
grade.
I
set
up
a
meeting
with
her
to
discuss
what
I
did
wrong:
she
didnOt
explain
anything
at
all.
I
received
poor
grades
from
her
the
entire
year.
It
was
only
until
the
night
before
the
AP
exam
that
I
realized
how
unprepared
my
classmates
and
myself
were
for
the
Language
and
Composition
test.
I
was
enraged
at
all
the
time
Julia
had
spent
not
teaching
us
anything.
I
walked
into
the
test
bitter
and
unfocused,
exchanging
worried
glances
with
my
classmates
and
friends.
Crowning
moment
of
glory?
Getting
a
5
on
that
AP.
I
would
only
find
out
later
from
my
senior
year
AP
Literature
and
Composition,
Ms.
Cincotta,
that
Ms.
Hollins
just
didnOt
NseeO
that
I
could
write
well,
just
didnOt
understand
what
my
other
teachers
saw
in
my
writing
style.
That
made
my
5
on
the
Language
and
Composition
AP
that
much
better.
After
my
unfortunate
writing
experiences
in
junior
year,
my
senior
year
writing
experiences
would
be
much
better.
Ms.
Cincotta
had
me
as
a
student
in
her
sophomore
honors
class
two
year
before
and
had
already
seen
that
I
could
write.
Although
I
was
very
shy
and
hardly
participated,
especially
in
her
class,
she
awarded
me
with
AOs
each
semester
for
what
my
written
work
showed.
Ms.
Cincotta
was
one
of
those
teachers
that
held
a
no-nonsense
attitude,
yet
was
quick
to
laugh
about
our
senior
year
antics.
In
short,
she
was
Ms.
HollinsO
opposite,
which
would
greatly
benefit
me.
My
writing
grew
under
Ms.
CincottaOs
hands-on
teaching
method
and
her
kind
advice.
Although
I
did
not
score
as
high
on
the
Literature
and
Composition
AP
test
as
I
had
on
the
Language
and
Composition
test
(I
got
a
4Efine
by
me)
by
the
end
of
Ms.
CincottaOs
course
I
new
that
I
was
more
than
adequately
prepared
for
college
level
writing
courses.
Ms.
Cincotta
took
my
writing
from
that
of
a
shy,
under
confident
high
school
student
to
that
of
a
confident
college
student
in
a
matter
of
months.
After
having
plenty
of
negative
and
some
positive
comments
about
my
writing
from
my
friends,
classmates,
family
and
teachers
over
the
course
of
my
early
years,
having
the
constant
support
of
Ms.
Cincotta
helped
me
to
really
expand
my
writing
into
the
mature
thing
it
is
today.
The
experiences
I
have
had
at
Lafayette
College
with
my
writing,
thus
far,
are
reflective
of
my
formative
years
in
the
Weston
public
school
system.
I
have
come
to
understand
that
professors
are
more
receptive
to
my
writing
if
I
ask
for
help,
a
novel
concept
to
a
freshman
who
was
too
afraid
to
have
asked
for
help
in
the
past.
I
have
been
fortunate
to
have
had
English
professors
who
have
been
very
helpful
and
kind
to
me
during
my
past
two
years
at
Lafayette
College.
While
not
every
professor
I
have
had
has
been
enamored
by
my
writing,
they
have
been
fair
in
their
grading
of
my
written
work.
At
this
point
in
my
life,
this
pattern
doesnOt
surprise
me.
While
I
can
say
that
I
was
prepared
for
college
level
writing,
I
was
not
prepared
to
have
to
work
as
hard
as
I
have,
especially
as
a
sophomore,
with
perfecting
each
paper
I
have
had
to
write,
from
research
preliminaries
to
the
finishing
touches
done
at
4
am
(I
wish
I
was
kidding).
My
writing
has
changed
a
great
deal
from
that
first
scrawled
accomplishment
of
writing
my
full
name.
My
writing
has
appeared
typed
in
book
reports,
painstakingly
edited
in
research
papers,
and
as
of
late,
featured
in
class
blogs
and
on
Moodle.
As
a
child,
I
could
not
have
seen
my
writing
getting
me
this
far
in
life.
From
being
accepted
into
honors
and
AP
level
English
courses
in
high
school
to
scoring
high
on
the
English
AP
tests
to
becoming
a
WA
(something
that
I
am
very
proud
of),
my
writing
has
grown
to
accommodate
my
endeavors
in
life.
