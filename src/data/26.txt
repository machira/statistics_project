From
the
Cradle
to
319
Pardee:
My
Life
as
a
Writer
My
history
as
a
writer
began
long
before
I
learned
to
write.
As
a
child
I
loved
to
have
my
parents
read
to
me,
and
my
understanding
of
the
power
of
words
began
when
I
learned
to
read
myself.
I
read
everything
I
could
get
my
hands
on
both
in
and
out
of
school.
Going
to
the
library
was
one
of
my
favorite
activities,
and
by
the
time
I
was
in
third
grade
I
had
read
nearly
every
book
in
our
small
public
library.
The
more
books
that
I
read,
the
more
I
wanted
to
write
too.
I
started
making
up
stories
before
I
could
write.
From
the
time
I
was
literally
a
baby
just
learning
to
speak
I
would
tell
myself
stories
as
I
went
to
sleep.
A
couple
of
times
my
mom
set
up
a
tape
recorder
in
the
bedroom
to
catch
me
at
work.
As
I
got
older,
I
still
liked
to
make
things
up
so
sometimes
my
mom
would
put
the
tape
recorder
out
in
the
kitchen
during
the
day
and
I
would
sit
there
telling
stories
into
it.
The
thing
I
remember
most
about
those
kitchen
sessions
is
how
encouraging
my
mom
was.
She
was
always
ready
with
praise
and
it
made
me
feel
like
the
worlds
best
little
writer/slash
child
prodigy.
These
tapes
made
their
way
into
the
Christmas
stocking
of
many
a
grandparent,
aunt,
uncle
and
various
other
extended
family.
My
literary
career
had
begun.
Ha
ha.
Third
grade
was
also
the
first
year
I
remember
doing
any
real
disciplined,
or
school
sanctioned
writing.
We
had
to
write,
illustrate
and
bind
our
own
original
story.
I
just
came
across
this
project
this
summer
in
a
forgotten
drawer
collecting
dust.
I
had
written
about
a
horse
who
gets
abused
but
eventually
finds
a
nice
place
to
live.
I
read
it
and
laughed
at
my
hand
writing
number
one,
but
I
also
laughed
at
how
heavily
influenced
I
was
by
the
Black
Beauty
books
and
other
books
I
had
read.
My
first
remembered
writing
attempt
was
essentially
an
imitation
of
the
kinds
of
books
I
was
interested
in'
at
that
time.
This
was
an
interesting
discovery
in
light
of
a
poetry
class
I
took
last
fall.
We
were
required
to
do
imitations
of
other
poems;
either
style
or
structure
etc.
At
the
time
I
thought
imitations
are
so
valuable,
I
wonder
why
I
have
never
used
this
tool
before?
This
summer
I
discovered
that
I
had
used
the
technique
before.
Another
method
I
use
now
that
has
roots
in
my
childhood
is
journal
keeping.
On
my
tenth
birthday
I
received
a
diary.
I
had
a
love
hate
relationship
with
it
because
for
me
it
had
to
be
all
or
nothing;
that
is
I
had
to
write
in
it
every
day
religiously,
or
not
at
all.
However,
during
the
times
when
I
was
writing
in
it
I
was
learning
about
creative
writing
and
how
to
construct
a
narrative
and
so
on.
You
can
imagine
how
a
ten
year
old's
diary
must
look:
Today
I
went
with
mom
to
the
store.
Pinched
little
brother.
Had
to
go
to
my
room...
I
wrote
off
and
on
in
diaries
until
I
arrived
at
Lafayette,
and
then
I
began
to
keep
a
journal
with
me
at
all
times.
Now
I
am
at
the
point
that
I
hate
to
be
without
it
because
something
always
happens
that
I
want
to
write
down.
I
don't
know
why
I
started
creative
writing
and
journaling
as
the
beginning
of
my
own
personal
literary
narrative,
but
I
suspect
it
is
because
creative
writing
seeps
into
all
that
I
write.
As
a
grammar
and
high
school
writer
it
was
usually
my
creativity
as
opposed
to
my
form
that
distinguished
me.
In
general
I
hated
school
up
until
college,
but
the
only
classes
I
liked
back
then
were
writing
classes.
If
I
could
inject
a
personal
opinion
here,
Marx
need
look
no
further
than
American
public
schools
for
signs
of
alienation
and
institutionalized
mediocrity.
I
hated
the
forced
conformity
and
busy
work
that
we
were
constantly
subjected
to
from
grades
K-12.
I
would
much
rather
have
spent
my
formative
years
writing,
reading
and
learning
on
my
own.
My
teachers
liked
my
creativity
in
grammar
school
but
by
the
time
I
got
to
high
school
it
was
a
different
story,
they
rarely
encouraged
it.
I
had
to
write
the
way
everybody
did.
I
began
to
doubt
my
writing
ability
in
high
school.
I
had
no
interest
in
writing
research
papers,
I
wanted
to
write
from
the
heart.
Now
that
I
think
about
it,
I
wrote
quite
a
bit
of
good
stuff
in
high
school.
I
wrote
a
play
called
The
Prunes
of
Turmoil
which
was
a
cross
between
Stienbeck
and
Tennessee
Williams.
I
created
a
subversive
collection
of
slanderous
cartoons
based
tightly
on
all
of
my
teachers
and
administrators.
My
friend
and
I
sold
copies
much
to
the
chagrin
of
the
teachers
and
administrators
who
were
targeted.
I
was
constantly
writing
stories
and
poems
mostly
for
myself,
or
my
friends,
but
some
I
published
in
the
school
literary
magazine.
When
it
came
time
to
write
a
formal
paper
though,
it
was
really
difficult
for
me.
I'll
never
forget
the
time
my
eleventh
grade
english
teacher
was
handing
back
our
research
papers
(I
had
done
mine
on
Stephen
King.
Why?
I
have
no
idea.
Probably
to
be
different)
and
she
said
in
front
of
the
whole
class
I'm
disappointed
in
you
Jen.
I
thought
I
would
die.
Here
I
was
with
this
reputation
as
a
good
writer
and
I
disappointed
her!
I
was
horrified
and
furious.
By
the
time
I
was
in
twelfth
grade
I
had
calmed
down
a
bit.
I
was
less
of
a
reactionary
and
more
fixated
on
getting
the
hell
out.
I
learned
to
read
a
teacher,
figure
out
what
s/he
wanted
and
write
accordingly.
It
sucked,
but
I
was
getting
A's
and
that
is
really
all
that
matters
right?
My
high
school
liked
to
tell
us
that
we
would
be
above
and
beyond
our
fellow
students
in
the
writing
department
when
we
got
to
college
because
of
the
superb
training
we'd
received.
I
thought:
PSYCHE!
Everyone
but
me!
I
am
a
bad
writer
slipping
through
the
cracks.
I
was
afraid
that
college
would
be
an
extension
of
the
hellishness
of
high
school.
I
was
wrong.
It
is
now
my
first
year
at
college.
During
the
summer
I
managed
to
rebuild
some
of
my
damaged
ego
while
working
at
a
job
where
I
was
constantly
writing.
I
had
signed
up
for
an
FYS
having
no
idea
what
that
meant,
and
so
I
went
in
cold
on
the
first
day.
I
believe
the
first
reading
assignment
we
had
in
Ways
of
Knowing
was
Thomas
Kuhn's
piece
The
Structure
of
Scientific
Revolution
.
I
took
it
home
and
read
it
with
gusto.
I
found
myself
explaining
it
to
fellow
classmates
who
lived
in
my
dorm.
I
actually
was
prepared
for
college!
I
was
ready
for
the
challenge.
I
learned
so
much
in
my
FYS.
Finally
I
was
able
to
write
the
way
I
wanted
to,
and
I
was
actually
glad
that
I
had
learned
how
to
conform
to
rules
and
structural
guidelines,
because
I
could
work
around
them
and
use
them
to
my
advantage.
My
proudest
moment
as
a
writer
was
my
first
writing
experience
at
Lafayette.
It
was
the
day
I
got
a
B-
on
the
first
FYS
paper
(I
think
it
was
the
highest
grade).
From
that
day
as
far
as
writing
goes,
I
have
received
wonderful
positive
reinforcement
here.
Professors,
WA's
and
other
students
push
me
and
challenge
me
to
do
the
best
I
can,
and
I
like
that.
I
have
learned
to
appreciate
and
accept
criticism.
I
know
that
I
will
never
peak
as
a
writer,
I
can
always
be
better.
That
is
one
of
the
benefits
of
being
a
WA;
I
get
to
help
other
students,
and
in
the
process
help
myself.
This
was
something
that
I
did
not
expect
when
I
started
as
a
WA,
but
my
own
writing
has
improved
as
a
result.
