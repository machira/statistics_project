Writing
Like

Prof.
Donahue

When
I
became
a
Writing
Associate,
I
crossed
the
line
and
became
one
of
them.
For
years,
I
would
write
papers
and
then
hand
them
to
others
for
evaluation.
Most
of
the
time,
it
was
a
two
part
process:
I
would
write
and
my
teacher
would
evaluate.
Occasionally,
I
would
get
friends
or
family
members
involved,
but
only
if
the
paper
was
interesting
or
important
enough
to
deserve
a
second
look.
My
only
responsibility
was
to
write.
However,
this
all
changed
when
I
was
named
a
Writing
Associate.
As
a
Writing
Associate,
I
was
not
only
required
to
write
papers,
but
now,
I
was
called
upon
to
read
and
evaluate
papers
as
well.
This
posed
numerous
challenges
for
me.
After
being
named
a
Writing
Associate,
would
I
become
complacent
as
a
writer
and
not
attempt
to
improve
myself
while
I
was
helping
others?
I
wondered
what
it
would
be
like
working
with
students,
and
if
they
would
actually
consider
my
suggestions
to
them.
I
also
wondered
how
teachers
would
rate
my
ability
to
help
their
students.
Would
I
be
able
to
tackle
subjects
like
genetic
engineering
and
Shakespeare?
Sure,
I
have
read
other
people's
papers
before.
All
through
high
school
and
even
in
college,
peer
editing
was
often
a
part
of
the
writing
process.
However,
never
before
was
I
recognized
as
an
authority,
or
someone
who
was
able
distinguish
good
writing
from
bad.
Had
I
gone
as
far
as
I
could
possibly
go
as
a
writer?
Was
there
anything
more
to
learn?
In
my
first
semester
as
a
Writing
Associate,
I
was
eager
to
receive
my
first
writing
assignment.
However,
it
being
the
first
semester
of
my
sophomore
year,
I
was
not
required
to
take
a
writing
course
such
as
FYS
or
VAST.
In
fact,
my
only
writing
assignments
for
that
whole
semester
were
two
term
papers,
each
around
ten
pages
in
length
and
both
due
around
the
same
time.
I
didn't
sweat
it
though-I
was
a
Writing
Associate.
After
spending
hours
reading
other
people's
work
and
reviewing
proper
grammatical
practices,
how
hard
could
it
be
to
do
some
writing
of
my
own?
To
prove
how
confident
I
was,
I
waited
until
shortly
before
the
deadline
to
write
the
two
papers.
However,
I
soon
learned
that
being
named
a
Writing
Associate
did
not
mean
that
I
was
at
the
apex
of
my
writing
career.
As
I
hurriedly
wrote
my
two
term
papers,
I
found
that
my
writing
process
had
changed.
I
was
not
strictly
a
writer
anymore.
Now,
I
was
editing
while
I
was
writing.
Granted,
everyone
goes
through
a
similar
process
of
editing
their
work
while
they
are
writing
it.
However,
I
felt
that
while
I
was
writing,
I
was
acting
not
as
an
author
fixing
his
own
work,
but
rather
as
an
editor
apart
from
the
author
who
looks
at
the
writing
from
a
separate
point
of
view.
I
was
almost
as
if
I
was
having
writing
conferences
with
myself
as
I
was
writing
the
papers.
Thus,
I
did
not
write
with
a
false
sense
of
security.
Rather,
my
awareness
was
heightened
as
I
gained
more
experience
as
a
peer
editor.
Now
when
I
write,
I
try
to
hold
myself
to
higher
standards;
although,
I
have
found
that
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
practice
what
I
preach.
It
is
funny
that
I
can
spend
an
entire
conference
talking
about
the
importance
of
a
strong
thesis
and
then
sit
down
and
attempt
to
write
a
paper
without
one.
However,
since
I
have
become
a
more
careful
reader,
my
writing
should
improve
as
well.
Unless,
of
course,
I
do
not
want
to
follow
my
own
advice.
As
a
Writing
Associate,
I
have
worked
with
all
kinds
of
students
with
various
backgrounds
and
writing
styles.
It
has
been
a
challenge
for
me
to
motivate
those
students
who
lack
confidence
in
their
writing
ability
or
have
little
interest
in
talking
about
their
work.
However,
I
feel
that
the
biggest
challenge
is
adapting
to
the
writing
styles
of
others.
Sometimes,
as
an
editor,
I
think
that
something
is
wrong
because
it
is
stated
in
a
manner
different
from
what
I
would
have
chosen.
A
Writing
Associate
has
to
realize
that
every
individual
has
their
own
style
of
writing,
and
in
order
to
help
these
individuals,
you
must
avoid
injecting
your
own.
Sometimes,
when
a
professor
assigns
only
a
single
paper
topic,
many
papers
end
up
saying
the
same
thing,
only
in
different
ways.
Writing
Associates
can
learn
from
these
different
writing
styles,
and
perhaps
employ
them
in
their
own
writing.
They
can
also
learn
different
methods
that
other
students
use
to
facilitate
the
writing
process.
I
have
grown
as
a
writer
through
discussions
with
the
professors
for
whom
I
have
worked
as
a
Writing
Associate.
In
my
first
semester,
I
worked
with
Dr.
Hal
Hochman,
an
economics
professor,
who
emphasized
the
importance
of
a
forceful
argument.
In
his
First
Year
Seminar,
students
were
required
to
take
positions
on
different
economic
issues
and
explain
why
they
chose
those
positions.
In
describing
what
he
expected
in
his
students'
papers,
he
explained
to
me
the
dynamics
of
a
cogent
argument.
And,
while
working
with
the
students,
I
saw
numerous
methods
that
writers
may
use
to
write
a
position
paper.
In
my
second
semester
as
a
Writing
Associate,
I
worked
with
Ian
Smith,
an
English
professor,
and
his
Shakespeare
class.
Because
Professor
Smith
taught
my
First
Year
Writing
course,
I
was
familiar
with
his
teaching
style
and
the
high
expectations
he
holds
for
his
students.
As
a
student
in
his
class,
I
struggled
with
his
writing
assignments
because
he
often
listed
a
broad
range
of
topics
to
be
discussed
in
only
a
few
pages.
It
is
difficult
for
the
writer
to
find
the
connection
between
each
of
the
topics
and
then
connect
them
sufficiently
in
a
certain
number
of
pages.
As
a
student,
these
writing
assignments
bothered
me,
but
when
I
became
a
Writing
Associate
and
was
asked
to
help
others
tackle
these
difficult
assignments,
I
learned
why
Professor
Smith
asked
his
questions
in
such
a
difficult
manner.
He
required
his
students
to
be
concise
so
that
their
papers
displayed
a
firm
grasp
of
the
assignment
without
adding
extraneous
information
that
diverted
the
reader
from
the
topic.
Students
were
forced
to
think
the
paper
topics
through
and
limit
their
writing
to
information
that
is
essential
to
their
thesis.
As
a
Writing
Associate
for
the
Shakespeare
class,
I
was
able
to
discuss
the
assignments
with
his
students
in
order
to
help
them
decide
what
was
essential
to
provide
support
for
their
thesis.
I
feel
that
I
was
able
to
help
these
students,
and
I
now
wish
that
there
was
a
Writing
Associate
for
his
First
Year
Writing
class
in
which
I
was
a
student.
It
was
also
a
positive
experience
working
with
Professor
Smith,
who
always
tries
to
bring
out
the
best
in
you
as
a
writer
and
a
person.
Having
taken
mostly
business
courses
during
my
second
year
at
Lafayette,
I
figured
my
VAST
class
would
be
a
good
opportunity
for
me
to
once
again
focus
on
improving
my
writing
skills.
I
chose
Professor
Donald
Miller's
VAST
class,
which
focuses
on
how
technological
improvements
help
build
cities.
Each
student
was
required
to
write
a
ten
page
paper,
which
would
give
me
ample
opportunity
to
develop
my
writing
skills.
However,
unlike
any
other
class
I
had
taken,
each
week
we
were
required
to
hand
in
numerous
pages
of
notes
that
answered
a
particular
question.
At
first,
I
was
pleased
by
this
type
of
assignment,
as
it
seemed
a
lot
easier
to
jot
down
a
few
pages
of
notes
rather
than
submit
answers
in
essay
form.
Unfortunately,
however,
I
struggled
with
these
assignments
instead.
I
found
it
difficult
to
hand
in
pages
and
pages
of
unfinished
ideas,
and
it
became
a
tremendous
chore
for
me
to
write
these
notes
each
week.
I
do
not
doubt
that
I
would
have
done
better
in
the
course
had
I
been
asked
to
write
papers
instead.
Perhaps
now,
as
a
Writing
Associate,
I
am
better
suited
to
write
papers
that
conform
to
conventional
writing
formats.
When
faced
with
an
abnormal
writing
assignment,
I
find
it
difficult
to
abandon
all
the
rules
and
boundaries
that
I
have
been
taught
and
have
been
practicing.
I
faced
a
different
challenge
as
a
writer
in
my
accounting
course.
In
business
classes,
such
as
accounting,
I
do
not
expect
to
receive
many
writing
assignments.
However,
in
my
Intermediate
Accounting
course,
I
was
often
asked
to
write
analyses
of
different
worksheets
that
I
produced.
This
kind
of
writing,
similar
to
lab
reports,
was
a
stark
contrast
to
the
essays
that
I
was
required
to
write
in
other
classes.
These
papers,
replete
with
numbers
interjected
into
the
text,
were
a
bore
to
read.
However,
I
found
that
these
papers,
albeit
lifeless,
were
easy
to
write,
as
they
were
written
almost
mechanically.
They
were
similar
to
any
other
papers
I
have
written,
only,
instead
of
supporting
conclusions
with
words,
conjectures
were
supported
by
numbers
intertwined
throughout
the
text.
A
new
semester
will
bring
a
fresh
group
of
students
with
different
ideas
and
writing
styles.
As
each
new
group
of
students
grow
as
writers,
so
do
I,
and
I
hope
I
am
able
to
help
them
make
the
transition
to
college
writing.
I
also
hope
that
with
more
experience
under
my
belt,
my
writing
(and
grades)
will
improve.
