WA
Essay
The
Wonder
Years
It
was
second
grade
when
I
got
my
first
OCompositionO
notebook.
I
remember
being
rather
inordinately
proud
of
what
was
a
50
page
double
margined
brown
notebook
since
it
was
to
me
a
sign
of
maturity.
After
all
you
had
to
be
in
second
grade
to
get
one
of
those.
It
was
a
badge
that
distinguished
me
from
the
lowly
first
grade
and
kindergarten
kids.
So
I
waited
in
anticipation
(with
ink
stained
hands)
as
Ms.Elizeabeth
walked
in
and
detailed
the
assignment.
She
wanted
two
pages
on
the
subject
of
OMy
PetO.
Now
the
topic
posed
somewhat
of
a
problem
since
I
didnOt
have
a
pet.
My
grandmother
who
lived
with
us
disapproved
of
all
four
legged
animals
(and
most
of
the
two
legged
variety
as
well),
so
the
closest
thing
I
had
resembling
a
pet
was
a
goldfish.
The
prospect
of
filling
two
pages
on
a
fish
that
did
nothing
but
swim
around
in
murky
water
distinctly
unappealing,
so
I
created
Chips.
Chips
was
the
dog
of
my
dreams,
a
crystallization
of
Timmy
from
the
Famous
Five
books
and
Buster
from
the
Five
Find
Outers
(I
used
to
read
a
lot
of
Enid
Blyton).
I
donOt
remember
his
breed
but
with
his
all
his
qualities
he
was
a
bit
of
a
super
dog.
Apart
from
being
strong,
fast,
and
loyal,
Chips
didnOt
smell,
his
hair
didnOt
shed
all
over
the
furniture,
his
licking
was
absent
of
moisture
and
he
was
potty
trained
from
birth
thereby
staying
clear
of
my
grandmotherOs
ire.
Him
and
me
ran
races,
went
swimming,
explored
various
sections
of
the
countryside,
stayed
out
late
and
were
the
scourge
of
all
would
be
thieves
and
burglars.
The
assignment
was
spread
over
3
weeks
and
I
remember
being
on
my
sixth
page
in
the
midst
of
an
exciting
rescue
from
a
ditch
when
Ms.Elizeabeth
wanted
the
books
turned
in.
As
I
wrote
I
remember
becoming
extremely
caught
up
in
the
fantasy
and
each
adventure
that
my
pen
invented
promised
an
excitement
and
variety
that
was
somewhat
absent
in
my
life
except
in
books.
The
rest
of
the
year
the
compositions
continued
in
the
same
vein.
It
used
to
be
the
class
where
I
could
indulge
all
my
flights
of
fancy.
When
the
topic
was
OMy
Summer
HolidayO
I
took
a
trip
to
Antartica,
OMy
AmbitionO
featured
me
winning
the
cricket
world
cup
for
India
with
a
last
ball
six
(an
equivalent
of
a
final
out
walk
off
grand
slam
homer
in
the
game
7
of
a
World
Series)
and
OMy
HobbyO
had
me
collecting
every
Famous
Five
ever
written.
The
great
thing
about
this
was
that
all
these
adventures
could
be
tailored
to
my
own
taste
and
of
course
most
importantly
I
could
always
style
myself
as
the
central
character
(with
Chips
in
an
occasional
supporting
role).
When
the
year
ended
all
the
notebooks
were
returned
to
us
and
I
couldnOt
wait
to
get
home
that
day.
I
thought
of
my
stories
as
significant
contributions
to
English
Literature,
up
there
with
Enid
Blyton
and
Roald
Dahl
and
this
notebook
would
prove
this
beyond
all
doubt
to
my
greatest
critic,
my
mother.
However
as
I
read
them
aloud
to
her
they
seemed
to
be
somewhat
short
of
the
mark
I
had
set
for
them.
This
was
the
first
time
that
I
was
reading
them
since
I
had
written
them
and
the
stories
I
was
reading
were
significantly
different
from
the
ones
I
remembered
writing.
Sure
they
shared
the
same
storylines
and
events
but
something
was
missing.
In
my
memories
I
could
remember
Chips
jumping
around
in
excitement
as
I
threw
a
ball.
I
remembered
the
thrill
at
my
first
sight
of
penguins
and
the
joy
of
tackling
the
robber
who
stole
my
mother
wedding
ring.
However
in
the
stories
I
was
reading
all
these
were
absent,
the
images,
the
sounds
and
the
feelings
all
seemed
to
have
disappeared.
My
mother
was
kind
enough
to
applaud
my
efforts
but
the
deficiencies
in
the
writing
were
quite
apparent.
My
stories
simply
lacked
that
life
or
vitality
that
made
them
so
special
in
my
head.
What
I
thought
wasnOt
really
what
my
pen
was
writing.
What
was
a
great
adventure
in
my
head
had
translated
into
a
rather
simplistic
narration
of
events
on
paper.
However
the
summer
and
cricket
beckoned
so
any
thoughts
of
working
on
my
writing
remained
very
fleeting.
I
did
very
little
writing
for
the
next
two
years
as
my
family
moved
to
Germany
and
I
was
enrolled
in
a
German
public
school.
However
my
parents
ran
an
off
and
on
home
school
so
as
to
keep
me
in
touch
with
the
Indian
system.
I
canOt
remember
writing
anything
interesting
over
those
two
years.
However
I
do
remember
that
thanks
to
my
mother
I
stopped
using
OAnd
thenEO
as
the
primary
method
of
sequencing
any
narration.
Also
under
my
fathers
regimen
my
handwriting
started
to
take
steps
towards
legible.
One
aspect
that
was
neglected
was
grammar.
English
grammar
and
its
arcane
rules
are
generally
taught
during
3rd
and
4th
grade
in
India,
the
two
years
that
I
missed
a
lack
that
often
becomes
evident
in
my
writing.
That
is
why
to
this
day
my
eyes
glaze
over
when
someone
mentions
Opast
participleO.
Fifth
grade
found
me
back
in
India
at
my
old
school
after
a
two-year
hiatus.
We
still
had
OCompositionO
notebooks
but
they
were
no
longer
objects
of
great
pride.
Since
I
had
come
to
the
realization
that
I
was
no
Mark
Twain
writing
no
longer
held
the
same
appeal.
Moreover
the
teachers
seemed
to
be
struggling
with
a
paucity
of
subjects
so
we
went
through
repeated
cycles
of
OMy
AmbitionO,
OMy
SummerO
and
OMy
HobbyO.
It
was
about
this
time
that
I
started
to
try
my
hand
at
poetry.
The
idea,
as
with
most
of
my
ideas
those
days
started
with
my
mother.
She
had
suggested
that
for
my
grandparentsO
anniversary
I
write
them
a
poem
about
grandparents.
I
fell
in
readily
with
the
suggestion
since
it
was
an
idea
that
saved
me
from
having
to
shell
out
any
of
my
meager
pocket
money.
Only
the
last
two
lines
rhymed
but
it
was
quite
an
entertaining
little
narrative
poem,
which
my
grandmother
actually
kept.
Since
the
first
attempt
had
gone
reasonably
well
I
decided
to
keep
at
it.
I
bought
a
thick
bound
book
and
titled
it
OShreedharOs
book
of
creative
writing:
Do
not
enterO.
I
think
my
tally
of
poems
was
at
eight
when
I
abandoned
them
in
order
to
able
to
concentrate
on
my
novel.
The
novel
was
the
product
of
an
imaginary
game
I
had
been
playing
by
myself
for
a
while.
It
involved
IndiaOs
rise
to
a
benevolent
superpower
while
becoming
a
country
similar
to
LennonOs
OImagineO
modeled
very
much
on
the
magical
country
of
Oz.
Obviously
I
was
at
the
center
of
this
great
rise.
However
as
the
game
developed
it
became
a
story
of
generations
after
generations
of
my
line.
My
younger
son
was
to
found
the
state
of
Baronia,
which
became
a
utopia
on
earth
and
indeed
was
to
go
on
to
absorb
India.
A
few
generations
later
another
descendant
managed
to
eliminate
all
weapons
from
the
earth
while
another
eliminated
money.
It
was
a
great
game
with
conquests,
intrigue
and
a
whole
host
of
sub
plots.
Eventually
I
decided
that
the
story
was
too
good
to
be
wasted
in
my
mind
and
must
indeed
be
put
on
paper
in
order
to
serve
as
a
model
which
one
day
I
would
perhaps
be
able
to
implement.
So
I
set
out
to
write
what
was
envisioned
as
a
four-part
epic.
In
characteristic
modesty
I
declined
to
name
the
main
character
after
myself,
choosing
the
name
Bharat,
which
in
Hindi
means
India.
The
epic
ran
a
whole
seven
chapters
before
I
finally
ran
out
of
steam
and
indeed
permanently
retired
my
book
of
creative
writing.
I
stumbled
across
that
book
last
year
and
had
few
nostalgic
flashbacks.
The
poems
despite
a
distinct
paucity
of
rhymes
(something
I
blame
on
the
nature
of
the
English
language)
expressed
some
themes
which
support
my
theory
that
I
have
been
regressing
since
I
reached
my
intellectual
peak
at
12.
It
was
however
the
seven
chapters
of
ORise
of
IndiaO
(Book
1)
that
really
held
me.
It
was
an
entertaining
read
as
Bharat
actually
managed
to
accomplish
some
pretty
Ocool
stuffO
in
those
chapters.
They
included
petroleum
manufactured
by
molecular
reconfiguration
of
grass,
an
Indian
Defense
Shield
that
repelled
all
nuclear
attacks,
environmental
protection
of
all
animals,
a
complex
economic
system
that
eliminated
poverty
and
a
disappointingly
brutal
invasion
of
Europe.
While
as
an
action
or
science
fiction
novel
it
was
entertaining,
as
my
12
year
old
vision
for
society
it
was
somewhat
of
a
letdown.
Just
as
in
second
grade
that
texture
was
missing.
There
was
some
progress
since
the
narrative
was
somewhat
concrete
and
not
punctuated
with
repeated
OAnd
thenEOOs.
But
the
whole
life
of
it
and
what
it
really
meant
to
me
was
missing.
The
story
was
still
one
that
belonged
in
my
head
rather
than
on
paper.
In
eighth
grade
the
whole
class
had
its
first
encounter
with
Ms.Gayatri.
Gayatri
madam
as
we
called
her
was
an
English
teacher
with
the
heart
of
and
German
drill
sergeant.
She
believed
in
cold
showers
at
5
a.m.,
absolute
obedience,
the
efficacy
of
punishments.
She
was
determined
to
impress
up
on
us
that
we
were
no
longer
children
and
therefore
were
expected
to
study
to
the
exclusion
of
all
activity
in
preparation
for
the
big
exam
we
would
take
at
the
end
of
10th
grade.
She
also
had
no
sympathy
for
the
fact
that
English
was
for
us
a
second
language.
We
were
expected
to
be
proficient
and
she
had
no
intention
of
lowering
her
standards
for
us.
Her
first
exam
was
designed
to
wreck
the
whole
classO
GPA.
For
once
having
a
62
stare
out
the
paper
at
me
was
somewhat
of
a
relief
(in
my
defense
the
class
average
worked
out
to
28).
Many
men
were
in
tears
at
the
end
of
that
day.
She
was
the
first
person
who
made
me
pay
attention
to
English.
Suddenly
I
started
to
pay
attention
to
what
I
was
writing.
I
even
started
to
rein
in
my
wilder
flights
of
imagination.
This
was
an
act
of
necessity
since
Gayatri
madam
insisted
on
structure
and
form
and
had
no
tolerance
for
transgressions.
It
was
the
first
time
I
remember
making
an
effort
in
English,
working
on
my
essays
to
make
sure
they
were
up
to
scratch.
She
was
also
the
first
and
to
date
only
teacher
who
managed
to
rein
in
my
tendency
to
verbosity.
My
first
essay
which
went
4
pages
over
specifications
was
slashed
and
a
games
period
had
to
be
wasted
in
rewriting.
With
her
a
three
page
essay
ended
two
lines
before
the
third
page
ended.
However
despite
those
classes
fraught
with
danger
I
think
I
survived
having
learnt
a
lot
more
about
English
than
I
had
in
the
preceding
eight
years.
It
was
next
year,
freed
from
Gayatri
madamOs
menacing
watch
that
I
saw
my
name
in
print
for
the
first
time.
The
newspaper
was
doing
a
feature
on
writing
by
high
school
kids.
My
English
teacher
showed
the
editor
an
essay
I
had
written
for
one
of
her
exams
and
my
Ocareer
as
a
published
authorO
took
off.
On
that
nostalgic
trip
where
I
found
my
book
of
creative
writing
I
also
ran
across
the
newspaper
clipping
with
that
story.
The
essay
had
been
about
a
household
chore
I
enjoyed
doing.
I
had
described
an
afternoon
where
my
mother
and
I
had
cleaned
the
house.
It
was
a
very
simple
article
hardly
a
page,
and
still
was
the
best
piece
I
have
ever
written.
There
it
was
on
paper
me
and
my
mother
on
all
fours
scrubbing
the
floor,
discussing
every
topic
under
the
sun.
But
for
once
the
moment
was
truly
conveyed
on
paper,
the
disappearing
dirt,
the
smell
of
the
lunch
she
cooked
and
how
truly
close
to
her
that
I
felt
that
day.
I
guess
it
worked
because
it
really
was
genuine,
a
special
moment
that
I
had
managed
to
transcribe.
For
the
latter
half
of
my
high
school
life
I
was
shipped
of
to
an
American
boarding
school
tucked
away
on
top
of
a
hill
in
the
middle
of
nowhere,
otherwise
known
as
Kodaikanal.
It
was
a
transplantation
into
an
environment
that
could
not
possibly
have
been
more
different
from
home
in
a
whole
multitude
of
ways
most
of
them
which
are
irrelevant
as
far
as
this
essay
is
concerned.
To
quote
Kipling
OThat
is
another
story
and
shall
be
told
at
an
another
timeO.
It
was
the
first
time
that
I
felt
somewhat
illiterate
in
an
English
class.
I
was
surrounded
by
people
for
whom
English
was
a
first
and
often
the
only
language.
The
idea
that
books
were
to
be
read,
understood
and
analyzed
rather
than
simply
memorized
was
a
wholly
new
concept
to
me.
Perhaps
the
rudest
shock
came
at
the
end
of
the
first
week.
Based
on
a
writing
sample
we
had
turned
in
on
the
first
day
our
teacher
Lewis
had
selected
a
group
of
ten
who
were
to
attend
a
workshop
for
writers.
With
a
slightly
inflated
ego
I
assumed
I
would
be
among
the
chosen
ten.
After
all
until
then
for
all
my
faults
I
had
been
considered
one
of
the
better
writers.
But
as
Lewis
rolled
of
the
names
I
counted
ten
none
of
which
include
me.
My
hopes
rose
when
he
announced
that
he
would
now
be
taking
eleven
rather
than
ten
students,
only
to
be
dashed
when
the
eleventh
name
turned
out
to
be
Ragvir
Sabarwal.
Lewis
and
me
spent
a
tumultuous
year
in
the
course
of
which
he
drummed
several
lessons
into
me,
some
about
writing
and
many
others
on
life
in
general.
He
was
the
first
person
who
tried
to
teach
me
how
to
really
write.
There
was
this
creative
piece
where
I
had
to
pretend
to
write
the
diary
of
Dunya
(DostoveskyOs
Crime
and
Punishment).
It
was
a
major
assignment
and
so
I
put
a
fair
amount
of
work
into
it
and
I
took
it
to
Lewis
for
an
early
reading.
I
waited
for
the
judgment
as
he
scanned
it
while
stroking
a
cat
that
was
on
his
lap.
After
about
10
minutes
he
looked
at
me
over
his
glasses
and
pronounced
N
C+
maybe
B-N.
Seeing
the
look
on
my
face
he
continued
with
an
uncharacteristic
kindness
NSee
Shree,
itOs
a
good
essay,
but
you
are
not
making
me
see
anything
new,
you
have
to
make
me
look
beyond
the
book
and
until
you
do
that
this
will
be
a
C
paperO.
Needless
to
say
I
burned
a
lot
of
midnight
oil
that
night
trying
to
convert
Svidrigalov
of
DunyaOs
diary
into
the
lecherous
pervert
that
Dostovesky
had
envisioned.
Lewis
was
also
the
person
who
made
me
work
on
writing
sentences
longer
that
five
words
showing
me
how
my
essay
on
YeatOs
OLapis
LazuliO
was
hopelessly
fragmented
due
to
the
short
sentences.
He
and
Mr.Menon
after
him
tried
gamely
to
restrict
my
extreme
verbosity
while
trying
to
open
my
eyes
to
the
various
elements
of
writing.
The
greatest
thing
that
two
of
them
did
beginning
from
LewisOs
pronouncement
on
DunyaOs
diary
was
to
make
me
THINK.
That
writing
was
to
be
accompanied
by
serious
thought
and
analysis
was
somewhat
of
a
paradigm
shift
for
me.
Rather
than
simply
fulfill
the
requirements
of
an
assignment
(the
C
paper)
they
made
me
think
of
how
to
use
those
elements
of
writing
that
I
had
been
learning
as
an
expression
of
my
thoughts
and
my
ideas,
thereby
making
my
work
something
thoughtful,
something
original,
something
that
was
truly
my
own.
Best
of
all
they
got
me
to
enjoy
the
experience
of
writing.
Unfortunately
despite
the
foundation
laid
by
Messrs.
Lewis
&
Menon
by
growth
as
a
writer
has
been
somewhat
retarded
and
almost
non-existent
mainly
due
to
my
own
lethargy.
I
feel
I
have
developed
fairly
well
as
an
analytical
writer.
I
am
often
able
to
get
my
points
across
in
a
clear
fashion
despite
the
verbosity.
I
think
I
have
also
learned
to
think
as
I
write
and
thereby
appreciate
various
dimensions
that
can
be
explored.
I
think
I
have
also
learned
to
write
in
a
more
considered
fashion,
taking
greater
to
see
that
the
point
that
I
am
getting
across
is
indeed
the
one
I
mean
to
get
across.
I
pay
more
attention
to
elements
of
writing
such
as
word
choice
and
paragraphs
and
sometimes
I
have
a
tendency
(often
unsuccessfully)
to
try
and
get
the
words
to
flow
together
in
a
lyrical
quality.
The
deficiencies
are
very
much
still
there.
As
this
essay
had
already
proven
I
am
still
losing
the
battle
with
verbosity.
Often
a
certain
clumsiness
creeps
into
my
sentences,
a
problem
accentuated
my
writing
hurriedly
and
a
reluctance
to
proof
read
my
own
writing.
It
is
still
missing
that
one
quality
it
has
lacked
since
2nd
grade.
The
texture
and
the
life
that
leaps
out
and
makes
you
want
to
read
something
is
till
missing.
The
moment
with
all
its
images
and
feelings
is
absent.
The
enjoyment
that
I
derive
from
the
writing
process
is
not
communicated
leaving
the
result
somewhat
drab,
while
adequate
rather
incomplete.
Of
course
since
writing
is
a
form
of
communication
perhaps
the
best
judgment
comes
from
those
who
read
it
and
at
Lafayette
there
have
been
rather
mixed
signals.
Professor
Bittner
called
my
writing
OadvancedO
while
Professor
Offner
was
of
the
opinion
that
Oit
was
glib
and
sometimes
lacking
in
substanceO.
Professor
Fabian
called
it
Oclear
and
conciseO
while
Professor
Van
Gullick
pounced
on
the
highly
deficient
grammar.
I
guess
until
I
can
communicate
what
I
am
really
thinking
clearly
and
concisely
I
still
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do.
