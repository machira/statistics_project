Project
for
Workshop:
Literary
Narrative
My
father
missed
my
first
day
of
school.
The
day
I
entered
first
grade,
he
was
in
Vermont
at
his
new
job,
and
my
family
was
in
the
process
of
selling
our
Brooklyn
apartment.
That
evening
after
IOd
returned
home,
he
called
to
see
how
the
day
had
gone.
I
was
in
tears
as
my
outraged
five-year-old
self
moaned,
NI
canOt
read
yet!O
For
years
before
that
day
I
had
demanded
that
my
parents
read
and
re-read
the
same
books
over
and
over
again
to
me,
so
frequently
that
I
actually
memorized
the
words,
and
knew
the
exact
timing
of
what
sentences
belonged
on
what
page.
Indeed,
one
of
my
parentsO
favorite
stories
is
one
where
I
was
on
a
long
plane
ride,
and
I
NreadO
in
a
loud,
clear
voice:
NIn
the
distance,
an
owl
hooted
a
song.O
It
was
a
phrase
I
had
remembered
from
a
corresponding
page
in
my
book,
and
it
was
impressive
enough
for
a
couple
of
the
nearby
passengers
to
inquire
as
to
whether
I
was
some
kind
of
child
prodigy.
Reading
was
my
first
love,
and
I
acquired
a
love
for
writing
soon
afterward.
In
second
grade
I
was
dubbed
Nthe
human
dictionaryO
which
made
it
easy
for
me
to
convey
my
imagination
into
words
on
a
page.
My
family
has
saved
countless
examples
of
my
young
handwriting
detailing
story
after
story,
usually
featuring
myself
as
well
as
whomever
my
best
friends
were
at
the
time.
I
distinctly
remember
reading
books
where
the
narrator
was
an
awkward
character,
and
I
was
determined
that
in
my
stories,
the
narrator
would
always
be
the
coolest
and
prettiest
of
all
the
princesses
(and
most
of
the
stories
were
about
princesses,
thank
you
Disney).
Writing
became
a
way
for
me
to
live
out
my
fantasies.
In
my
stories,
my
character
could
live
in
a
castle
and
be
a
mermaid
who
owned
two-dozen
horses.
Her
somewhat
less
attractive
friends
could
come
along
for
all
her
outings,
and
they
wouldnOt
even
have
to
ask
their
moms
for
permission!
A
new
world
had
been
opened
up
to
me.
Not
only
was
the
content
of
interest
to
me,
but
the
style
of
my
handwriting
was
also
a
primary
concern.
I
recall
jealously
watching
as
other
girls
in
my
class
developed
their
own
writing
styles,
slanting
the
letters
or
creating
patterns
in
the
way
they
dotted
their
IOs.
My
own
writing
always
seemed
so
plain
in
comparison.
I
can
even
remember
the
way
in
which
my
teacher
wrote
on
a
large
piece
of
paper
in
the
front
of
the
classroom,
using
a
large,
black
squeaky
marker
in
order
to
create
a
series
of
letters
with
identically
swooping
gOs
and
yOs.
Soon,
however,
the
topic
of
handwriting
became
somewhat
obsolete
as
I
was
introduced
to
something
new:
word
processing.
In
fourth
grade,
computers
were
placed
in
our
classroom
and
we
were
all
required
to
complete
a
typing
tutorial
program.
This
featured
an
black-haired
teenage
girl
named
Kiki
who
traveled
around
the
world
and
if
only
we
could
type
fast
enough
we
could
help
her
overcome
certain
obstacles
she
faced,
whether
it
was
winning
a
race
as
we
increased
our
words
per
minute
or
completing
a
puzzle
due
to
our
accuracy.
These
computers
were
in
a
diamond
formation,
and
I
would
always
choose
the
one
in
the
corner
so
that
when
I
was
done
with
the
program
I
could
write
my
stories
in
private.
I
distinctly
remember
guarding
the
screen
as
I
developed
new
plot
twists
so
that
my
cool,
beautiful
character
named
Anja
(my
favorite
name
at
the
time)
could
outwit
the
cruel
Mrs.
Hannigan,
the
keeper
of
the
orphanage
based
on
one
of
my
childhood
games
at
an
after-school
program.
Unfortunately,
however,
as
summer
ended
and
I
enrolled
in
junior
high,
the
days
of
story
writing
were
left
behind.
I
suppose
it
just
wasnOt
cool
to
be
a
writer
in
those
days.
During
this
period
I
was
in
the
unfortunate
circumstance
of
being
placed
with
a
woman
who
found
that
the
easiest
way
to
teach
was
to
bring
the
class
down
to
the
level
of
the
slowest
student.
Throughout
the
years
of
seventh
and
eighth
grade
there
were
only
two
main
projects
that
demanded
my
attention:
research
papers.
At
the
end
of
each
year,
we
were
required
to
complete
a
large
report
on
a
certain
subject.
Even
then
we
were
not
pushed
to
choose
a
topic
that
was
new,
rather
we
could
select
something
we
already
knew
a
great
deal
about
(in
my
case,
The
Beatles)
and
therefore
the
outside
research
that
was
necessary
was
minimal
and
the
experience
was
not
enriching.
In
all
honesty,
the
standards
to
which
I
pushed
myself
during
those
years
were
not
those
set
by
the
teacher.
Rather,
I
was
pushed
by
my
parents
who
both
knew
that
I
liked
to
write
and
could
do
it
well,
and
wouldnOt
settle
for
me
dropping
to
the
level
of
some
of
my
classmates.
They
too
considered
the
class
a
joke,
and
will
still
tease
me
about
a
parent-teacher
conference
they
had
in
seventh
grade.
The
teacher
had
reported
that
I
was
doing
quite
well
in
the
class,
but
sheOd
really
appreciate
it
if
I
stopped
reading
during
her
lectures.
Rather
than
paying
attention,
IOd
been
devouring
(more
interesting)
novels.
Some
of
the
writing
that
I
did
at
the
time
was
in
fact
outside
of
school.
On
family
vacations
I
would
take
along
a
notebook
and
meticulously
record
every
detail
of
the
trip,
from
what
the
clouds
looked
like
on
the
plane
ride
to
the
hilarious
attempts
weOd
make
at
communication
with
the
locals
while
lost
in
Mexico.
These
journals
now
serve
as
an
excellent
way
for
me
to
examine
the
writer
I
was
then,
and
to
remember
details
from
years
ago.
At
the
time,
they
were
a
way
that
I
could
take
a
moment
to
contemplate
all
the
new
experiences
I
was
facing.
In
addition,
I
always
kept
a
diary
that
of
course
was
filled
with
recollections
of
conversations
IOd
had
with
my
crush
and
why
my
best
friend
Lia
was
convinced
that
he
liked
me.
At
times,
these
diary
entries
would
sometimes
contain
much
more
intimate
and
meaningful
descriptions
of
emotions
I
was
feeling
at
the
time.
Re-reading
these
entries
enables
me
to
go
back
and
remember
the
disagreements
IOd
had
with
my
parents,
or
the
sadness
I
was
feeling
about
not
being
the
most
popular
girl
in
school.
This
type
of
free-flow
writing
is
something
that
I
still
enjoy
today.
Upon
entering
high
school,
however,
I
found
that
I
had
much
fewer
moments
to
myself
in
which
I
could
write
independently.
I
was
somewhat
overwhelmed
by
the
new
workload
my
freshman
year
and
spent
many
a
late
night
adjusting.
In
terms
of
quantity
I
had
many
more
hours
of
homework
each
evening,
and
the
quality
expected
was
quite
unlike
what
used
to
earn
me
AOs
back
in
middle
school.
Research
papers
were
much
longer,
and
often
included
other
more
creative
aspects.
For
example,
we
had
to
do
a
project
on
Greece
and
Rome
that
required
me
to
not
only
write
a
short
research
paper
on
the
Trojan
War,
but
also
to
write
a
short
fiction
story
from
the
perspective
of
Aphrodite
and
to
draw
and
analyze
some
Roman
coins.
This
integration
of
multiple
topics
was
quite
new,
but
also
far
more
interesting
than
anything
to
which
I
had
been
previously
exposed.
This
first
year
was
challenging
for
many
reasons.
In
addition
to
the
new
homework
load,
I
also
was
required
to
truly
prove
myself.
I
was
no
longer
with
a
teacher
for
whom
my
name
would
give
me
an
automatic
grade.
I
was
not
a
dramatic
standout
as
I
had
been
before.
If
I
left
an
assignment
until
the
last
minute,
my
grade
would
suffer,
and
if
it
were
late
the
teacher
would
not
hound
me
down
until
I
turned
it
in
D
I
might
just
not
receive
any
credit
at
all!
It
seemed
heartless
and
impossible.
However,
the
adjustment
that
I
had
to
make
during
that
year
was
one
that
was
crucial
to
my
current
success
as
not
only
a
good
writer,
but
also
as
an
organized
and
diligent
one.
During
my
sophomore
year
I
was
placed
in
NEnglish
10,O
the
required
course.
This
was
my
first
taste
of
poetry
and
of
literature
analysis.
It
was
the
first
time
that
I
was
required
not
only
to
attempt
original
creations,
but
also
to
try
to
identify
with
published
poets
and
understand
their
messages,
use
of
symbols,
etc.
I
remember
feeling
anxious
and
nervous
as
I
was
asked
to
read
my
own
poems
or
interpretations
aloud
to
the
class,
terrified
that
my
classmates
would
laugh
and
consider
my
work
cheesy
or
meaningless.
At
the
end
of
the
year
we
were
even
required
to
memorize
both
a
poem
of
our
own
and
one
from
another
author
and
recite
them
to
a
group
of
our
parents
and
peers!
I
believe
that
this
kind
of
writing
designed
for
a
performance
was
also
a
key
component
in
shaping
the
writer
I
am
today.
As
a
junior
I
was
a
part
of
a
class
designed
to
teach
the
Holocaust
in
a
detailed
fashion.
The
course
culminated
in
a
trip
to
Boston
and
Washington
in
which
we
visited
museums
and
memorials
as
well
as
Holocaust
survivors.
After
returning,
we
had
to
create
a
project
to
reflect
our
experience
and
present
it
in
a
symposium
format
to
an
audience.
Writing
this
speech
required
me
to
not
only
analyze
my
own
memories
and
emotions
about
a
powerful
week
of
my
life,
but
also
to
design
these
memories
in
a
way
that
I
could
effectively
showcase
them
for
a
listener.
This
required
much
more
than
simply
writing
them
down
for
my
own
purposes.
The
most
difficult
of
all
speeches
was
the
one
I
read
at
my
grandfatherOs
funeral.
My
grandfather
and
I
had
been
extremely
close.
I
had
been
born
soon
after
his
retirement
at
a
time
where
he
was
feeling
somewhat
lost
and
unnecessary.
My
neediness
as
an
infant
paired
with
his
desire
to
give
created
a
lasting
bond,
and
he
got
to
know
me
better
than
he
had
his
own
children.
After
giving
me
so
much
in
life,
I
felt
obligated
to
speak
at
the
service
commemorating
his
death.
Writing
that
speech
was
draining
and
emotional,
but
rewarding
too
as
I
sifted
through
countless
memories
and
thoughts
that
had
been
left
untouched
for
years.
But
at
the
end,
I
had
created
a
work
that
would
have
made
him
proud,
and
in
doing
so
had
tested
my
own
limits
D
especially
when
it
came
time
to
perform
it.
After
holding
back
sobs
and
delivering
the
final
words,
I
descended
from
the
podium
and
returned
to
my
seat
to
hold
hands
with
my
equally
teary-eyed
grandmother
and
parents.
I
had
never
been
required
to
write
something
so
difficult,
and
had
never
accomplished
something
so
important
with
my
words.
The
experience
certainly
taught
me
a
great
deal
about
my
strengths
as
a
writer.
Another
important
strength
I
gained
during
my
junior
year
of
high
school
when
I
was
recruited
to
be
a
part
of
my
schoolOs
national
award-winning
yearbook.
Here,
I
was
introduced
to
journalistic
writing,
and
with
it
deadlines,
interviews
and
stress,
stress,
stress!
Never
before
had
there
been
so
much
academic
pressure
put
upon
my
work.
Now
I
was
not
just
writing
for
my
own
grade,
but
the
job
I
did
would
also
reflect
the
entire
group
and
if
it
were
late
we
would
all
be
penalized.
I
remember
hiding
in
a
bathroom
as
the
yearbook
advisor
walked
down
the
hallway,
knowing
that
if
she
saw
me
I
would
be
yelled
at
for
the
tardiness
of
my
latest
article.
However,
I
eventually
grew
accustomed
to
the
system,
and
served
as
an
editor
in
my
senior
year.
This
position
gave
me
a
leadership
opportunity
that
forced
me
to
concentrate
more
on
my
own
writing,
knowing
that
it
would
serve
as
an
example
to
the
rest
of
the
group.
It
is
also
extremely
rewarding
to
be
able
to
open
up
one
of
those
yearbooks
and
see
my
own
words
in
print!
Finally,
senior
year
rolled
around.
I
enrolled
in
AP
English,
and
was
required
to
complete
several
essays
over
the
summer.
IOd
heard
rumors
about
the
tough
grading
of
Mr.
Greenwald
but
was
still
shocked
to
receive
such
harsh
comments
about
my
first
two
essays.
Those
red
markings
were
an
immense
blow
to
my
writing
ego,
and
I
began
to
think
that
maybe
I
wasnOt
such
a
strong
writer
after
all.
My
recollections
of
that
class
mostly
revolve
around
that
same
fear.
The
atmosphere
of
the
room
was
unlike
anything
I
had
ever
come
across
before,
and
nothing
since
has
matched
it.
Mr.
Greenwald
was
for
a
very
formalized
work
environment,
and
therefore
required
not
only
that
we
call
him
by
his
last
name,
but
that
he
too
would
call
me
Ms.
rather
than
Ruthie.
It
was
only
fair,
he
reasoned.
Our
most
frequent
assignments
were
literature
analysis
essays,
and
they
were
all
graded
on
a
scale
out
of
nine.
They
were
graded
out
of
nine
of
course
because
no
one
ever
had
or
ever
would
receive
a
perfect
ten.
I
was
once
sitting
in
a
calculus
class
when
Mr.
Greenwald
appeared
at
the
door
and
asked
that
the
teacher
excuse
me
so
that
he
could
have
a
word.
The
entire
class
went
silent
as
if
to
wish
me
luck
as
I
nervously
followed
him
out
into
the
hallway.
There,
as
I
waited
for
him
to
lay
into
me
for
some
mistake
or
forgotten
assignment,
he
extended
his
hand
and
said,
NCongratulations
Ms.
Gelber,
you
received
a
nine
on
your
latest
essay.O
I
was
taken
aback
as
I
completed
the
handshake,
stammered
a
thank
you
and
watched
him
turn
and
walk
away.
His
class,
with
its
tough
grading
and
repeated
efforts
to
perfect
an
essay
format
was
perhaps
the
most
important
semester
in
shaping
my
writing.
After
a
few
brutal
months
with
Greenwald
and
one
two-hour
test,
I
was
able
to
bypass
College
Writing
at
Lafayette.
I
believe
that
the
high
school
course
more
than
prepared
me
for
what
I
would
face
in
the
new
writing
environment.
The
most
valued
tool
I
gained
was
a
final
boost
in
confidence
that
I
could
carry
with
me
into
a
college
classroom
D
a
kind
of
confidence
that
would
allow
me
to
write
with
conviction
and
purpose
without
needlessly
meandering
in
the
direction
of
what
my
dad
would
call,
NBS.O
My
experiences
with
Lafayette
writing
have
been
fairly
positive.
At
the
beginning
I
was
somewhat
wounded
when
my
first
few
FYS
essays
did
not
earn
the
grades
I
would
have
liked,
but
I
soon
grew
a
better
taste
for
the
college
writing
scene
after
making
a
few
more
attempts.
I
believe
that
the
professors
here
are
less
lenient
than
in
high
school
about
the
focus
of
a
piece
D
they
ensure
that
the
extraneous
NfluffO
has
been
removed.
My
writing
has
become
more
efficient
and
purposeful
which
is
enormously
important.
I
think
that
writing
for
my
Lafayette
classes
and
my
own
reflections
about
how
far
IOve
come
make
me
more
certain
than
ever
that
I
hope
to
find
a
career
where
writing
is
an
essential
part
of
what
I
do.
It
has
been
not
only
a
favorite
subject,
but
also
(to
risk
sounding
cheesy)
a
crucial
and
rewarding
part
of
my
life.
