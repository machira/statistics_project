Writing
Program
New
WA
Literary
Narrative
I
still
remember
the
first
time
I
tried
to
write
something
in
school.
It
was
1998,
and
I
was
just
beginning
to
take
a
liking
to
my
afternoon
kindergarten
classes.
IOd
been
eyeing
the
array
of
fat
magic
markers
aligned
in
a
bin
right
in
front
of
me
for
quite
a
while,
but
hadnOt
been
allowed
to
use
them
for
what
seemed
the
longest
time.
The
colors
of
the
rainbow
called
out
to
me
from
that
bin,
begging
me
to
uncap
them
from
their
plastic
prison
and
let
them
run
free
on
the
paper
in
front
of
me.
Finally
it
was
time
to
put
them
to
use
on
the
worksheet
IOd
been
handed
at
the
beginning
of
class-
a
page
full
of
numbers
with
blank
boxes
beneath
them
waiting
to
be
filled
with
my
best
attempt
at
copying
the
original.
My
teacher
soon
gave
us
the
okay
to
try
it,
so
I
popped
off
the
cap
of
the
bright
purple
marker,
my
favorite
color,
and
proudly
started
scribbling
away
at
what
I
was
convinced
was
a
masterpiece.
Soon
Mrs.
Zerby
came
walking
by
our
table
and
looked
at
the
numbers
weOd
drawn,
and
I
waited
with
bated
breath
for
the
praise
I
knew
sheOd
have
for
my
work.
NWow!O
she
exclaimed
as
a
smile
began
on
my
face,
NJennifer,
that
is
a
great
number
7.
Good
job!O
My
face
fell
as
I
heard
the
compliment
for
my
friend
seated
next
to
me.
I
looked
at
her
page
and
compared
her
beautifully
drawn
number
7
to
my
hastily
crafted
attempt,
and
I
soon
realized
that
she
had,
in
fact,
done
a
better
job
than
me.
Now
that
I
look
back
on
it,
I
have
a
feeling
that
day
was
where
my
dedication
to
writing
began.
I
wanted
to
write
beautifully
and
I
wanted
others
to
like
it.
As
I
progressed
through
elementary
school,
I
advanced
from
crayons
and
markers
to
notebooks
and
gel
pens.
As
I
learned
the
alphabet
and
how
to
form
words,
I
carefully
crafted
pages
of
imaginative
childhood
stories.
I
paid
as
much
attention
to
my
penmanship
as
I
did
to
the
words
I
chose
to
write.
I
took
pride
in
writing
what
I
knew
was
quality
work,
and
was
all
too
happy
to
show
my
creations
to
my
parents
and
teachers
to
show
them
what
I
could
do.
By
the
time
third
and
fourth
grade
rolled
around,
I
had
added
typing
skills
to
my
repertoire
of
writing
tools.
My
fingers
flew
across
the
keyboard
faster
than
any
other
student
in
my
class,
and
I
soon
earned
the
award
of
NNew
Hope-Solebury
Elementary
SchoolOs
Fastest
Typer.OI
was
so
proud
of
that
accomplishment,
and
I
loved
that
I
was
now
able
to
produce
stories
even
faster
than
I
had
by
hand
writing
them.
My
imagination
ran
wild
with
possibilities,
from
original
stories
about
my
pets
to
new
takes
on
fairy
tales,
and
I
fell
in
love
with
the
ability
to
create
something
I
could
call
my
own.
When
middle
school
came
around,
I
soon
learned
that
positive
feedback
wasnOt
the
only
thing
I
was
going
to
receive.
Criticism
came
along
with
the
compliments,
and
my
young
eleven
year
old
mind
wasnOt
yet
mature
enough
to
handle
that
I
didnOt
know
everything
about
writing
after
all.
I
grew
into
an
insecure
and
self-conscious
being,
a
shadow
of
the
excited
and
confident
young
writer
IOd
been
in
elementary
school.
My
lengthy
imaginative
stories
turned
into
short
poems
that
hid
in
the
backs
of
my
school
notebooks.
I
knew
that
was
one
place
only
my
eyes
would
reach,
and
there
was
no
risk
that
others
could
find
it
and
criticize
my
work.
My
writing
had
become
something
solely
for
myself,
as
I
had
grown
embarrassed
of
my
work
for
fear
that
others
would
judge
me
for
it.
The
progression
into
middle
school
also
introduced
me
to
the
world
of
academic
writing,
which
I
soon
decided
I
did
not
like.
I
longed
for
the
imaginative
elaboration
IOd
discovered
in
my
creative
writing,
but
soon
learned
that
it
didnOt
always
belong
in
Nschool
writing.O
I
wanted
the
praise
for
my
imagination,
so
it
took
a
while
to
realize
that
praise
could
also
come
for
this
new
kind
of
writing.
Always
eager
for
a
compliment
from
my
teacher,
I
forced
myself
to
learn
the
worlds
of
persuasive
writing,
argumentative
essays,
and
research
papers
in
order
to
receive
high
marks
and
positive
compliments.
As
a
result,
my
creative
writing
struggled
to
find
a
place
to
escape.
Middle
school
also
introduced
me
to
the
desire
to
fit
in
with
others.
It
affected
my
choices
and
I
started
acting
in
ways
I
thought
others
wanted
me
to.
My
creative
writing
thus
became
something
of
a
secret.
It
didnOt
have
a
place
in
my
classes,
where
my
teachers
expected
more
scholarly
work.
Nor
did
it
have
a
place
in
my
social
circle,
where
the
fear
of
ridicule
hindered
my
comfort
with
sharing
my
writing.
Only
in
my
notebooks
and
binders
did
my
true
work
show,
and
only
I
knew
that
it
existed.
By
the
seventh
grade,
I
had
started
a
journal
that
I
wrote
in
every
single
day.
I
wrote
down
the
emotions
and
thoughts
about
things
going
on
around
me,
and
often
times
my
writing
stemmed
from
a
thought
that
I
just
couldnOt
get
out
of
my
head.
A
single
line
would
turn
into
a
short
story,
something
IOd
tweak
and
edit
until
I
thought
it
was
perfect.
By
this
time,
though,
my
writing
had
finally
found
an
audience-
the
internet.
With
my
discovery
of
the
internet
world
came
the
blessing
of
anonymity.
I
could
hide
behind
the
comfort
of
a
username
and
express
my
true
feelings
to
the
world
without
worrying
that
people
would
judge
me.
No
one
could
tell
that
it
was
writing
these
stories.
The
world
knew
me
only
by
the
usernames
I
allowed
it
to
see,
and
joy
soon
replaced
the
pain
of
hiding
my
work.
Negative
reviews
continued
to
pour
in
with
the
positive
ones,
but
by
now
I
could
handle
it.
The
people
who
didnOt
like
my
work
didnOt
know
who
I
was,
and
therefore
I
couldnOt
be
judged.
This
was
a
step
in
building
confidence
in
my
writing,
but
it
would
take
much
longer
for
my
courage
to
build
enough
to
share
my
ideas
with
my
known
identity
backing
them.
Soon
middle
school
rolled
into
high
school,
and
I
had
learned
to
have
more
confidence
in
my
ideas.
A
crowning
moment
of
this
achievement
came
in
the
evaluation
of
the
paper
IOd
been
required
to
write
during
my
junior
year
for
my
high
school
graduation.
I
had
been
studying
brain
cancer
since
my
sophomore
year
by
working
with
a
neuro-oncologist
and
had
decided
to
write
a
paper
about
the
creation
of
a
Ncancer
vaccine.O
It
was
something
that
was
truly
fascinating
to
me,
but
I
was
also
a
bit
embarrassed
about
taking
on
such
an
ambitious
topic.
I
had
confidence
in
my
ideas
on
my
own,
but
the
luxury
of
online
anonymity
hadnOt
helped
my
comfort
with
receiving
feedback
as
a
known
author.
I
was
self-conscious
about
sharing
the
paper
I
was
working
on
because
I
didnOt
want
to
let
people
down.
I
felt
that
I
had
something
to
prove
by
writing
a
good
paper
about
my
challenging
topic,
and
I
was
so
scared
that
I
was
going
to
fail
in
that
goal.
With
the
determination
to
succeed
fueling
me,
I
threw
myself
into
my
research.
I
scoured
sources
online,
in
books,
and
in
person
and
mapped
out
a
plan
of
attack
to
tackle
this
massive
research
paper.
I
had
learned
how
to
write
research
papers
in
middle
and
high
school,
but
this
was
something
different.
I
had
never
written
a
ten
page
research
paper
before,
so
I
needed
to
learn
how
to
fill
the
space
with
quality
writing
and
examination.
Now
that
I
look
back
on
it,
I
realize
that
this
was
preparation
for
college
writing
but
at
the
time
the
task
seemed
monumental.
I
wasnOt
sure
I
could
do
it
but
I
still
felt
that
drive
to
succeed
and
write
a
quality
paper.
I
remember
the
day
I
received
my
grade,
a
month
after
IOd
turned
in
my
paper.
My
English
teacher
held
up
the
stack
of
stapled
papers,
mine
among
them,
and
paused
before
she
began
handing
them
out.
NNow,
I
read
a
lot
of
papers
here,O
she
began,
Nbut
I
just
want
to
point
out
one
of
them
that
truly
stood
out
to
me.
It
covered
a
topic
I
really
knew
nothing
about,
but
explained
it
in
such
a
way
that
really
fascinated
me.
It
was
really
well
written.O
I
sat
at
my
desk
at
the
back
of
the
classroom
and
twiddled
my
thumbs,
waiting
for
her
to
name
the
paper
that
was
undoubtedly
written
by
one
of
the
kids
at
the
top
of
the
class.
It
had
to
be
one
of
the
teacherOs
pets
that
she
always
praised.
NStephanie
Hunter.
Fantastic
job.O
My
head
snapped
up
at
the
sound
of
my
name
and
my
cheeks
flushed
as
each
of
my
thirty
classmates
turned
around
to
look
at
me.
I
couldnOt
help
the
shy
smile
that
grew
across
my
face,
and
I
remember
thinking
NI
did
it.O
I
was
so
happy
and
so
proud
of
myself,
even
though
I
felt
slightly
embarrassed
by
all
the
attention.
IOd
tackled
a
new
type
of
writing
I
wasnOt
sure
I
could
master,
and
IOd
received
praise
for
it
from
one
of
the
most
difficult
teachers
in
the
school.
I
felt
on
top
of
the
world.
I
remembered
that
moment
throughout
the
rest
of
my
high
school
career.
It
had
taken
me
until
that
moment
to
realize
that
I
had
to
stop
worrying
about
what
others
thought
about
my
writing.
I
couldnOt
let
my
fear
of
criticism
stop
me
from
trying
to
write
to
the
best
of
my
ability.
So
throughout
SAT
and
ACT
essays,
AP
exams,
and
college
applications,
I
didnOt
let
myself
hold
anything
back.
I
wrote
my
heart
out,
laid
everything
on
the
line
and
let
all
my
ideas
see
the
light
of
day.
It
earned
me
two
4Os
on
my
AP
exams
and
entry
in
my
top
choice
college.
I
had
started
writing
with
my
name
confidently
attached
to
my
work,
for
I
had
finally
started
believing
in
my
own
abilities.
By
the
time
I
began
my
freshman
year
of
college,
I
was
for
sure
intimated
by
the
idea
of
college
writing.
IOd
heard
countless
stories
about
huge
papers
and
pulling
all-nighters
just
to
get
them
done.
But
I
now
had
confidence
that
with
enough
hard
work
and
dedication
to
my
ideas,
I
could
handle
it.
The
idea
of
huge
papers
still
scared
me,
though.
After
all,
my
graduation
essay
had
taught
me
that
it
isnOt
easy
to
keep
that
level
of
focus
for
so
long.
But
IOd
also
learned
that
I
couldnOt
let
my
own
fears
get
me
down.
I
could
no
longer
fear
my
professorOs
critique
of
my
writing
or
worry
that
I
wasnOt
able
to
finish
the
paper.
I
had
the
writing
tools
there
at
my
disposal-
I
just
had
to
have
confidence
that
I
could
use
them.
My
first
semester
of
college
passed
with
the
creation
of
many
difficult
papers
for
my
Freshman
Year
Seminar,
but
IOm
still
proud
of
each
of
them.
I
enjoyed
writing
about
the
unique
topic
of
abortion
for
that
class
because
I
learned
so
many
different
aspects
about
the
abortion
debate
that
I
had
never
known
about
before.
Structuring
persuasive
and
argumentative
essays
about
different
sides
of
the
debate
gave
me
new
insight
into
the
topic.
I
also
learned
how
to
write
a
literary
review
of
works
written
by
others
about
the
topic.
It
added
to
the
writing
skills
I
had
at
my
disposal
for
future
papers,
including
lab
reports
for
my
other
classes.
I
had
never
written
a
lab
report
before,
but
the
analytical
approaches
and
literary
critiquing
techniques
I
learned
in
my
FYS
allowed
me
to
write
strong
lab
reports.
I
was
able
to
analyze
published
scientistsO
reports
using
the
skills
IOd
learned
in
my
FYS,
and
was
thus
able
to
include
the
ideas
I
discovered
into
my
own
writing.
It
has
definitely
made
me
a
stronger
writer.
I
can
honestly
say
that
without
writing,
I
wouldnOt
be
the
person
I
am
today.
From
scribbling
with
magic
markers
in
kindergarten
to
writing
this
essay
on
my
laptop
today,
IOve
sure
come
a
long
way.
My
creative
writing
has
given
voice
to
the
difficult
emotions
and
problems
IOve
faced,
and
my
academic
writing
has
given
voice
to
the
views
I
have
about
various
topics
and
arguments.
Without
these
skills,
I
know
IOd
feel
helpless
and
without
an
outlet
for
expression.
I
know
that
working
as
a
Writing
Associate
is
going
to
help
me
learn
to
better
analyze
and
discuss
ideas
about
defined
topics
and
about
structured
writing
in
general.
But
for
right
now,
I
can
only
imagine
what
my
future
years
at
Lafayette
will
add
to
my
skills
and
experience
as
a
writer.
