I
must
admit
upfront:
I
have
never
considered
writing
one
of
my
fortes.
I
suppose
I
should
clarify
the
previous
statement.
On
the
whole,
I've
felt
that
the
end
results
of
my
writing
process
have
been
fairly
solid,
sometimes
even
cause
for
a
self
pat
on
the
back.
As
a
writer,
however,
as
someone
who
actually
sits
down
to
put
pen
to
paper
or
fingertips
to
keyboard,
I
probably
leave
something
to
be
desired.
For
me,
writing
of
almost
any
form
has
always
been
at
least
somewhat
if
not
extremely
torturous.
Whether
it
be
a
book
report,
a
literary
analysis,
or
a
letter
to
a
friend,
I
find
myself
brooding
over
each
painful
word.
For
what
I
believe
to
be
genetic
reasons,
the
act
of
creating
something
out
of
nothing,
of
filling
up
a
blank
page,
has
never
come
easy
to
me.
Furthermore,
I've
had
virtually
no
capacity
for
creative
writing
since
day
one.
My
first
writing
accomplishment
that
I
can
remember
serves
as
evidence
to
this
statement.
At
the
age
of
six,
I
wrote
a
soon-to-be-bestseller
entitled
and
her
Cats.
The
text
was
written
in
black
colored
pencil
with
accompanying
crayon
illustrations.
The
book
itself
was
made
of
red
and
green
construction
paper
with
a
blue
yam
binding.
It
told
the
story
of
a
young
girl
named
and
her
cat,
Mooch.
Mooch
had
recently
given
birth
to
a
litter
of
four,
and
loved
to
play
with
her
new
pets.
She
pulled
a
string
so
that
the
kittens
would
jump
and
chase
after
it,
and
she
laughed
as
they
clumsily
stumbled
over
each
other.
The
story
ended
with
having
to
bid
a
sad
goodbye
to
her
kittens
before
her
parents
brought
them
to
the
Humane
Society.
It
wasn't
a
bad
book
really,
especially
for
a
six
year
old.
It
flowed
well,
was
grammatically
correct,
had
a
solid
introduction
and
conclusion,
and
even
included
some
"big
words".
I
showed
it
to
my
parents
and
my
five
older
brothers
and
sisters,
all
of
whom
gave
me
raving
reviews.
Unfortunately
(and
obviously),
the
book
was
100%
autobiographical,
without
a
grain
of
creativity.
Yes,
even
at
this
young
age,
my
abilities
and
inabilities
seemed
clearly
spelled
out.
I
was
of
course
too
young
to
realize
my
shortcomings,
so
I
listened
to
the
praise
of
others
and
considered
my
first
major
work
an
overall
triumph.
My
next
recollection
of
writing
is
of
the
sixth
grade.
Sister
Frederick
was
going
over
our
Social
Studies
test
corrections
when
she
forced
me
to
read
my
essay
out
loud.
Immediately
after
my
lecture,
she
proceeded
to
rant
and
rave
over
my
abilities,
order
the
rest
of
the
class
to
follow
my
example,
encourage
me
to
enter
an
essay
contest,
and
ultimately
embarrass
me
in
front
of
my
peers.
When
I
think
back
to
this
event
and
to
similar
ones
that
followed,
I
can
theorize
as
to
why
I
received
such
praise.
My
guess
is
that
I
had
a
keen,
perhaps
even
precocious
sense
of
how
to
make
things
"sound
nice".
I
knew
that
Sister
Frederick
not
only
wanted
the
correct
answer
to
her
essay
question
about
the
lifestyle
of
the
Massai
tribe,
but
she
also
wanted
to
see
that
I
was
able
to
make
one
sentence
ease
gracefully
into
the
next,
finishing
off
with
a
pleasant
conclusion
about
how
"fascinating"
the
tribe
was.
I
gave
her
what
I
knew
she
wanted.
Despite
the
old
nun's
public
humiliation
of
me
in
class,
I
decided
to
follow
her
suggestion
to
enter
a
contest.
For
each
of
the
next
three
years,
I
participated
in
the
Modern
Woodmen's
Civic
Oration
Contest.
To
this
day,
I
have
no
idea
what
could
possibly
be
the
membership
requirements
of
this
particular
organization,
nor
do
I
understand
their
connection
to
public
speaking.
Nevertheless,
I
participated
in
and
ended
up
winning
the
contest
three
years
in
a
row.
Through
this
experience,
I
learned
the
importance
of
clarity
and
coherence
in
expressing
my
ideas
and
the
necessity
of
making
arguments
in
a
logical
sequence.
In
addition,
I
discovered
the
art
of
capturing
and
holding
onto
an
audience.
I
began
to
feel
more
confident
with
my
research-based
writing,
and
creative
writing
assignments
fortunately
remained
few
and
far
between.
During
my
first
year
of
high
school,
I
was
exposed
to
scientific
writing
for
the
first
time.
Along
with
showing
us
the
actual
format
for
this
type
of
paper,
Dr.
Walsh,
my
biology
teacher,
demanded
that
we
"get
rid
of
the
garbage,"
in
other
words,
omit
any
extraneous
and
potentially
confusing
words
or
phrases.
He
thereby
challenged
me
to
resist
my
temptation
to
always
make
things
"sound
nice".
He
did
not
want
to
read
the
extent
to
which
the
flow
of
blood
through
the
arteries
was
"fascinating";
he
simply
wanted
the
facts.
So,
I
was
once
again
reminded
that
a
writer
must
take
her
or
his
particular
audience
into
consideration.
During
this
period
of
my
writing
career,
I
also
realized
that
my
teachers
may
have
actually
been
onto
something
the
numerous
times
they
had
urged
me
to
write
rough
drafts
of
a
paper.
I
had
always
firmly
believed
in
extensive
reflection
before
beginning
the
actual
writing,
but
in
my
opinion,
forethought
was
sufficient.
Thus,
when
a
written
outline
was
to
be
handed
in
with
a
final
draft,
I
sometimes
sunk
to
the
lowest
of
lows
by
writing
up
the
outline
after
the
paper
had
been
completed.
Throughout
my
high
school
years,
however,
the
act
of
writing
a
paper
in
one
fell
swoop
became
more
and
more
unrealistic.
I
especially
disliked
the
fumes
of
"Wite-Out"
and
the
blue
erasable
ink
covering
my
hands
as
a
result
of
deciding
at
the
last
minute
that
a
sentence
or
even
a
paragraph
needed
to
be
moved
or
revised.
So,
I
gave
in
and
finally
started
to
participate
in
the
process
of
revision.
My
writing
continued
to
receive
positive
feedback
from
my
teachers,
namely
its
structure,
clarity,
and
cohesion.
In
my
second-year
American
Literature
course,
however,
I
came
to
recognize
some
of
my
inadequacies.
When
given
a
specific
research
or
analytical
writing
assignment,
I
felt
fairly
competent.
On
the
other
hand,
when
a
teacher
wanted
to
give
the
class
a
"break"
by
assigning
a
creative
project,
writing
for
me
reached
a
new
level
of
painfulness.
No
matter
how
long
or
how
hard
I
brainstormed,
I
simply
could
not
come
up
with
an
idea
that
seemed
semi-original.
I
often
found
myself
resorting
to
tiresome,
predictable
scenarios
such
as
a
horrible
event
which
turns
out
to
be
just
a
nightmare,
and
similar
cliches.
Even
when
I
won
an
honorable
mention
in
a
city
poetry
contest
it
was
for
a
poem
mimicking
the
style
of
an
established
poet.
This
realization
of
my
limitations
ignited
in
me
pangs
of
frustration
and
at
some
moments
a
sense
of
helplessness.
I
continued,
nevertheless,
to
grow
as
a
writer.
In
my
Senior
AP
English
course,
constant
assignments
somewhat
eased
my
struggles.
With
each
new
project,
one
immediately
following
another,
I
felt
myself
settling
into
a
rhythm
which
allowed
the
words
to
come
more
naturally.
Frequent
exercises
such
as
free
writing
in
class
and
timed
essay
questions
made
my
work
less
contrived
and
gave
my
dictionary
and
thesaurus
a
rest.
Writing
in
a
classroom
surrounded
by
fidgety
students
also
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
increase
my
concentration
skills.
Being
forced
to
be
prolific,
therefore,
resulted
in
improvements
in
both
my
output
as
well
as
my
writing
habits.
College
brought
numerous
new
challenges
to
the
writer
in
me.
I
first
needed
to
adapt
to
composing
on
a
computer
instead
of
with
pen,
paper,
and
the
occasional
typewriter.
While
writing
my
first
paper
for
my
First
Year
Writing
course,
I
realized
that
there
were
bigger
issues
with
my
methods
that
needed
to
be
addressed.
Through
discussions
with
my
writing
associate
and
professor,
I
learned
that
I
needed
to
pay
more
attention
to
content.
Thanks
to
hindsight,
I
recognize
now
that
most
of
my
work
in
high
school
merely
skimmed
the
surface
of
any
real
topics.
I
began
to
understand
that
it
is
not
enough
to
have
an
idea,
but
that
that
idea
must
be
developed
to
its
full
potential.
I
saw
that
the
superficial
observations
which,
had
previously
been
the
"meat"
of
my
papers
would
no
longer
suffice.
So,
I
pushed
and
pushed
my
ideas
to
newer
levels,
beyond
what
I
had
earlier
believed
to
be
their
limits.
By
the
end
of
my
first
year,
I
noticed
my
improvements
in
this
area.
My
observations
were
confirmed
and
my
confidence
restored
when
a
professor
urged
me
to
have
one
of
my
papers
published.
One
of
my
biggest
challenges
was
the
type
of
writing
I
encountered
during
my
Junior
year
in
France.
First,
I
was
no
longer
working
in
English,
so
much
of
my
attention
had
to
be
given
to
both
grammar
and
the
various
nuances
that
are
often
difficult
to
distinguish
in
a
foreign
language.
During
the
first
half
of
the
year,
my
writing
became
once
again
laborious
as
I
worked
with
my
10-pound
French-English
dictionary
at
my
side.
At
the
same
time,
however,
I
had
to
make
sure
not
to
abandon
the
structural,
stylistic,
and
development
skills
I
had
worked
so
hard
to
acquire.
Second,
I
was
back
to
the
old
mechanics
of
the
erasable
pen
and
loose
leaf
as
computers
were
not
made
available
to
the
students
of
my
program.
Third,
I
had
to
adapt
to
a
culture
who
has
a
very
different
idea
of
what
a
college
paper
should
be.
A
new
format
was
required
by
my
French
professors.
For
the
first
semester
of
my
writing
course,
I
produced
nothing
but
papers
including
an
introduction,
followed
by
a
body
presenting
two
sides
to
an
argument,
followed
by
a
conclusion.
This
rigid
structure
left
little
to
no
room
for
the
personal
observations
and
analysis
which
had
always
been
encouraged
in
my
previous
writing
courses.
By
the
beginning
of
the
second
semester,
my
French
had
greatly
improved.
I
found
myself
writing
more
freely,
almost,
but
not
quite
as
naturally
as
I
might
in
English.
My
professors
were
more
flexible
than
those
of
the
first
semester,
and
so
I
felt
more
comfortable
expressing
my
own
ideas
in
my
writing.
In
the
last
month
of
the
academic
year,
however,
I
hit
what
felt
like
a
brick
wall.
My
"Paris
Theater"
professor
thought
it
might
be
"amusant"
if
each
student
in
the
class
wrote
a
play.
While
the
rest
of
the
class
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief,
I
felt
my
muscles
beginning
to
tense.
I
spent
the
next
two
weeks
in
a
constant
state
of
brainstorming.
Night
and
day,
I
came
up
with
different
ideas,
pondering
each
for
about
an
hour,
and
ultimately
disregarding
them
as
unworkable.
I
even
called
my
family
to
poke
at
their
brains,
hoping
that
they
may
be
able
to
recount
a
scenario
that
would
in
turn
give
me
a
basis
for
my
play.
Finally,
I
had
no
choice
but
to
resort
to
one
of
my
own
real-life
experiences.
My
play
ended
up
being
about
a
man
I
had
met
in
the
park
one
afternoon.
The
actual
plot
had
been
altered,
but
all
in
all
it
was
basically
an
autobiographical
storyline.
Although
my
play
received
a
good
grade
and
the
praises
of
my
professor
for
my
character
development
and
use
of
the
language,
I
was
not
satisfied
with
what
I
had
produced.
I
thought
back
to
my
and
her
Cats
days
and
felt
as
though
I
had
made
no
progress
in
the
time
between.
My
lack
of
creativity
has
been
perhaps
the
most
frustrating
aspect
of
my
writing
career.
So,
that
brings
me
to
today.
I
still
labor
over
many
of
my
words,
but
not
as
much
as
I
used
to.
I
still
sometimes
wish
that
I
could
produce
inspiring
poetry
and
original
stories,
but
I'm
learning
to
accept
that
my
mind
simply
does
not
function
in
that
manner.
While
I
recognize
these
shortcomings,
I
try
not
to
dwell
on
them.
I'd
like
to
believe
that
I
have
strengths
in
other
areas
and
that
I
can
use
those
abilities
to
further
improve
my
own
writing,
as
well
as
that
of
others.
I
look
forward
to
the
challenge
of
reading
papers
of
my
peers
and
focusing
not
on
the
superficial
aspects
of
their
work,
but
on
the
real
core
of
and
organization
of
their
ideas.
I
am
confident
that
this
will
be
beneficial
to
both
them
and
myself
in
our
continuing
writing
careers.
