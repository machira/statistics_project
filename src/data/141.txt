Paper

This
paper
is
going
to
discuss
my
writing
experience
during
last
semester
when
I
was
studying
abroad
in
Brussels,
Belgium.
As
a
computer
science
major,
I
had
always
found
it
difficult
to
choose
classes
freely.
Meeting
the
course
requirement
of
computer
science
had
reduced
my
writing
experience
to
a
minimum
for
the
past
year.
However,
during
my
last
semester
abroad,
without
too
many
appropriate
CS
classes
to
take,
I
was
able
to
fill
up
my
schedule
with
a
couple
of
courses
that
require
a
considerable
amount
of
writing.
I
am
going
to
discuss
two
of
the
classes:
one
in
which
I
worked
hard
and
loved;
the
other
I
did
not
do
well
in.
However,
I
learned
a
lot
from
both
writing
experiences.
In
the
former
case,
I
was
able
to
write
in
a
depth
I
had
never
explored
before.
The
latter
class
helped
me
identify
the
weakness
of
my
writing.
Together
they
reinforced
my
own
philosophy
in
writing:
quality
writing
should
only
be
the
fruit
of
critical
thinking,
nothing
else.
I
took
Economics
and
Ethics
because
the
class
was
offered
by
a
professor
from
Lafayette.
It
turned
out
that
the
merit
of
the
class
was
far
more
than
that.
Since
I
had
no
background
in
economics
coming
into
the
class,
I
was
worried
that
this
300
level
class
may
be
too
difficult.
Cramming
on
the
supply
and
demand
curves
for
several
nights
relieved
the
mental
burden
for
me
but
did
not
help
much.
The
class
was
in
the
format
of
a
seminar
and
concentrated
on
various
readings
from
leading
scholars
in
fields
such
as
economics,
law
and
philosophy,
which
oftentimes
means
they
were
hard
to
read
or
understand.
The
professor
was
a
believer
in
Socratic
Method.
The
class
was
filled
with
his
questions
and
seldom
were
we
able
to
give
the
correct
answer.
And
the
worst
was
that
there
was
never
a
direct
answer
from
the
professor
himself.
However,
After
two
weeks
in
absolute
uncertainty,
I
gradually
found
myself
able
to
follow
the
class
and
the
professor's
thoughts
and
teaching
method.
But
then
came
the
writing
assignment.
Consistent
with
his
Socratic
Method,
the
professor
gave
a
open-ended
assignment.
The
contents
and
style
were
up
to
us,
as
long
as
the
paper
was
related
to
the
topics
discussed
in
class.
Deciding
on
a
topic
to
write
was
not
too
difficult.
In
fact,
the
topics
discussed
were
all
pretty
interesting.
Soon
I
decided
on
a
topic
called
Coase
theorem.
However,
once
I
sat
down
and
turned
on
my
computer,
I
realized
all
I
know
about
the
theorem
could
be
finished
in
five
sentences.
What
else
should
I
write
about?
I
started
to
realize
the
true
meaning
of
such
an
assignment.
Merely
knowing
what
the
topic
is
about
is
far
from
enough
to
write
a
paper,
not
to
mention
a
good
one.
I
had
to
know
more
about
the
topic,
know
how
to
apply
the
theorem
to
real
life
situations.
With
the
only
resource
for
help
being
the
readings
assigned
to
us,
I
started
to
reread
the
papers
on
Coase
Theorem.
Amazingly,
the
more
I
read,
the
deeper
I
understood
what
Coase
was
trying
to
convey.
With
my
interest
in
technology
and
law,
I
soon
found
the
link
between
Coase
Theorem
and
a
real
life
case:
the
ongoing
case
between
ACLU
and
the
Communications
Decency
Act
before
the
US
Supreme
Court.
I
downloaded
the
full
text
of
the
most
recent
court
argument
and
studied
it
line
by
line.
Several
issues
in
the
case
were
related
to
Coase
theorem
and
a
choice
of
the
most
appropriate
one
was
not
easy
to
make.
After
some
thought,
I
decided
to
go
ahead
with
one
of
the
ideas
and
write
the
paper.
I
was
mid
way
through
when
one
of
the
points
of
Coase
Theorem
suddenly
came
to
me
and
I
realized
the
issue
I
was
writing
about
wasn't
that
appropriate.
I
was
stuck
with
a
paper
half
done,
whose
contents
I
was
having
second
thoughts
about.
The
decision
to
rewrite
the
whole
paper
was
difficult,
but
the
harder
thing
was
to
come
up
with
something
else
more
relevant
to
write
about.
A
random
after-dinner-chat
with
my
roommate
saved
me.
Instead
of
going
to
the
bar,
we
sat
down
and
talked
about
our
own
papers.
One
of
his
comments
about
the
Communications
Decency
Act
suddenly
showed
me
a
totally
new
angle
of
looking
at
the
case.
The
actual
rewriting
process
last
two
days.
It
evolved
constantly
referring
back
to
the
readings
by
Coase
and
the
court
script
of
the
CDA
case.
Throughout
the
whole
process,
I
was
constantly
feeling
of
having
a
more
and
more
accurate
grasp
of
the
theorem
and
the
case
I
was
writing
about.
And
the
result
was
terrific.
I
received
a
rare
A
for
the
paper
and
its
originality
in
material
and
accurate
capture
of
the
gist
of
the
theory
impressed
the
professor.
The
writing
process
itself
seems
long
and
painful.
However,
looking
back,
I
am
amazed
that
I
was
able
to
successfully
deal
with
a
topic
so
complicated
in
nature
and
by
my
actively
writing
and
thinking,
the
theory
itself
left
a
deep
mark
in
my
mind
and
would
follow
me
for
a
long
time.
The
other
writing
class
during
the
same
semester
was
a
totally
different
experience.
Saying
it
is
a
bad
doesn't
merely
mean
that
I
didn't
get
a
good
grade,
but
more
importantly
I
didn't
improve
my
writing
ability
or
interest
through
the
experience.
The
class
was
European
Studies,
one
where
students
get
to
travel
to
several
places
in
Europe
to
learn
the
culture
and
history.
The
writing
requirement
of
the
class
included
several
short
fact-describing
essays
and
one
term
paper.
Because
the
class
was
trying
to
teach
American
students
as
much
of
European
history,
religion
and
art
as
possible,
everything
was
basically
skimmed
through.
The
requirement
for
the
students
was
basically
to
know
the
materials,
nothing
deeper
than
that.
This
wasn't
a
problem
for
the
several
short
essays.
Describing
certain
events
easily
fulfilled
the
requirement.
Then
came
the
term
paper,
whose
topic
was
also
broad:
anything
that
had
to
do
with
the
thousands
of
things
we
talked
about
in
class.
However,
since
none
of
the
materials
covered
in
class
was
discussed
in
detail:
all
we
knew
is
historical
facts,
in
its
most
abstract
form.
It
was
difficult
to
prepare
a
term
paper,
where
usually
a
thesis
was
required,
with
such
minimum
knowledge.
A
trip
to
the
library
was
even
more
disappointing.
A
library
mainly
for
the
Dutch
speaking
community,
it
offered
few
references
on
the
various
subjects
in
the
English
language.
With
not
much
I
could
do,
I
picked
a
topic
that
I
could
find
some
books
on
it
and
started
to
write
a
fact-finding
term
paper,
reluctantly.
The
result
wasn't
good.
The
topic
of
Karl
Marx
was
a
popular
one
in
the
class,
most
probably
because
there
are
most
books
on
him
in
the
Library.
Gathering
information
became
the
most
important
and
almost
only
step
in
the
writing
experience.
No
time
to
process
the
information
prevented
me
to
form
a
thesis
that
will
lead
the
information
I
gathered.
In
the
end,
the
paper
looked
like
the
life
story
of
Karl
Marx
and
the
thesis
I
was
trying
to
form
was
not
well
supported
by
relevant
information.
A
failed
writing
experience
sometimes
is
more
important
than
a
successful
one.
It
didn't
destroy
my
belief
what
writing
is
or
what
writing
should
be.
Instead,
it
reinforced
my
belief
in
that
good
writing
can
only
be
achieved
through
active,
critical
thinking.
Any
writing
process
that
doesn't
involve
this
will
not
generate
a
good
result.
