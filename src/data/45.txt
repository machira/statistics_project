Throughout
my
life
writing
has
always
been
an
important
medium
of
communications.
Living
in
a
foreign
country
forces
me
to
spend
even
more
time
with
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pen
in
my
hand
writing
letters
to
family
and
friends
or
recording
my
thoughts
in
a
diary.
However,
my
experiences
with
writing
can
be
subdivided
into
two
distinct,
somewhat
unrelated
parts.
Up
until
a
few
years
ago
most
of
my
writing
was
done
in
Ukrainian,
my
native
language.
I
first
started
using
English
as
an
everyday
language
when
I
was
a
Rotary
Exchange
Student
at
Ward
Melville
High
School,
Setauket,
NY.
Ever
since
then
most
of
my
creative
and
academic
writing
is
done
in
English,
exception
being
letters
home.
I
cannot
clearly
recall
my
earliest
writing
attempts
but
I
assume
that
they
were
very
similar
to
everyone
else's:
short
compositions
in
elementary
school
about
my
summer
vacations
or
a
book
that
I
have
read.
I
guess
they
(the
attempts)
did
not
stick
in
my
mind
because
by
the
time
I
went
to
school
my
grandmother
taught
me
how
to
read
and
write.
Throughout
elementary
school
my
teacher
has
always
encouraged
us
to
share
our
experiences
and
opinions
and
very
often
we
were
asked
to
write
them
down.
A
warm
smile
from
the
teacher
or
a
pat
of
approval
on
the
back
were
often
enough
to
encourage
kids
to
do
some
extra
work.
One
thing
that
stands
out
in
my
mind
about
my
early
writing
is
that
calligraphy
was
an
essential
part
of
it.
A
sloppy,
untidy
hand-
writing
was
often
punished
by
a
lower
grade.
Since
then,
the
appearance
of
papers
is
of
great
importance
to
me.
What
I
consider
being
an
important
step
in
my
development
as
a
writer
came
in
sixth
grade.
At
that
time
i
was
taking
a
Ukrainian
literature
course
that
required
a
considerable
amount
of
reading
and
memorization.
Besides
that
my
teacher,
Mrs.
Dudys,
encouraged
us,
the
students,
to
write
and
write
a
lot.
Our
exams
consisted
of
writing
five-six
page
literary
criticisms
of
novels
and
poems
or
analysis
of
main
characters
in
the
book.
It
was
always
a
great
challenge
to
produce
a
good
paper
because
quite
often
we
were
given
only
a
few
days
notice.
Most
of
the
topics
also
required
a
fair
amount
of
research
concerning
the
background
of
the
author
or
the
conditions
under
which
the
work
was
written.
Students
were
not
allowed
to
bring
any
drafts
to
school
on
the
day
of
the
exam
and
they
received
two
separate
grades
for
the
paper:
one
for
the
content
and
another
for
correct
spelling
and
grammar
usage.
It
was
a
very
interesting
and
rewarding
time
as
I
felt
that
I
was
learning
a
tremendous
quantity
of
new
material.
The
only
negative
memory
was
that
the
range
of
things
we
could
write
about
was
somewhat
limited.
As
I
grew
up
in
the
former
Soviet
Union,
all
throughout
my
childhood
and
teenage
years
I
was
told
how
wonderful
it
was
to
live
in
the
USSR
and
how
much
I
loved
Father
Lenin
and
the
Soviet
people.
When
I
was
younger
I
have
never
given
it
a
second
thought,
and
only
now
I
realized
that
we
were
exposed
only
to
certain
books
and
were
allowed
to
quote
only
certain
authors.
It
was
about
the
same
time
that
I
started
seriously
learning
English.
At
first,
students
were
only
learning
the
alphabet
and
trying
to
repeat
words
that
sounded
nothing
like
Ukrainian
language.
Yet,
in
a
year
or
two
I
was
already
writing
my
own
little
stories
about
family,
friends
summer
vacations.
I
remember
those
times
as
being
very
exciting
and
very
frustrating
at
the
same
time
mostly
because
I
had
the
desire
but
not
the
ability
to
write.
Writing
a
ten
sentence
story
about
a
green
tree
out
in
the
yard
was
not
a
very
creative
experience,
especially
when
one
has
to
look
up
every
other
word
in
the
dictionary.
With
time
and
months
of
hard
work
my
ability
to
use
English
improved
significantly.
By
the
time
I
was
in
ninth
grade,
I
was
able
to
give
written
reports
on
the
topics
that
actually
required
some
kind
of
research
and
analysis.
The
topics
would
include
Educational
System
in
the
United
States
or
Places
of
Interest
In
London.
My
English
teacher
believed
in
learning
by
mistakes
and
she
made
us
write
short
compositions
almost
every
day.
She
also
encouraged
us
to
read
a
lot
knowing
that
extensive
reading
leads
to
better
writing,
Yet,
I
never
really
found
full
satisfaction
writing
in
English
because
quite
often
I
would
lack
a
correct
word
or
have
to
think
about
grammar
structures
instead
of
concentrating
on
the
flow
of
thoughts.
At
the
same
time
my
writing
in
Ukrainian
was
progressing
very
differently.
When
I
was
fifteen
I
started
keeping
a
journal
which
served
as
a
reflection
of
the
thoughts
that
have
crossed
my
mind
more
than
a
recorder
of
events
that
have
occurred
that
day.
Sometimes
I
would
not
open
that
little
book
for
days
and
sometimes
I
would
write
for
hours,
depending
on
the
state
of
mind
I
was
in.
Often
my
friends
and
I
made
up
games
that
consisted
of
writing
short
plays,
dialogues,
jokes
that
we
would
later
act
out.
Thinking
back
of
my
high
school
experiences
with
learning
in
general,
I
am
very
pleased
with
the
wide
variety
of
writing
I
have
been
exposed
to.
Most
of
my
teachers
encouraged
me
greatly
by
offering
advise
when
I
was
uncertain
or
praising
good
work
when
deserved
it.
It
is
mostly
their
positive
attitude
that
made
me
persistent
in
trying
to
improve
my
writing
ability.
As
I
have
already
mentioned
before,
my
development
as
a
writer
in
English
took
a
slightly
different
course.
First
awareness
of
my
ability
to
express
my
thoughts
freely
in
English
came
when
I
took
a
Senior
English
course
while
being
an
exchange
student
on
Long
Island.
Some
of
the
requirements
for
the
class
included
writing
papers-criticisms
of
the
books
that
we
have
read
in
class.
Before
I
took
this
class,
I
was
very
shy
to
speak
up
or
write
in
English
simply
because
I
was
afraid
of
making
to
many
mistakes.
However,
my
English
teacher,
Mr.
Leverich,
was
able
to
awaken
a
desire
to
discuss
freely
ideas
and
opinions
that
have
been
brought
up
by
students.
This
sort
of
encouragement
finally
broke
my
timidness
and
uncertainty
and
I
was
extremely
proud
when
I
received
an
A
on
a
paper
criticism
of
a
novel
My
Name
Is
Asher
Lev.
Another
important
step
towards
mastering
the
language
was
when
I
wrote
a
poem
for
the
same
class.
I
have
never
really
written
a
poem
in
my
life,
and
here
I
was
facing
the
assignment
to
write
one
describing
myself
in
a
foreign
language.
The
poem
had
to
be
twenty
lines
long,
written
in
iambic
pentameter,
and
based
on
the
description
of
the
Oxford
Cleric
in
The
Canterbury
Tales.
I
have
spent
several
nights
working
on
the
assignment
and
the
end
result
was
well-worth
the
time
spent.
I
realized
I
could
finally
write
and
write
fairly
well
in
a
foreign
language.
After
all
the
training
that
i
have
received
in
high
school,
transition
to
college-level
writing
was
not
a
very
hard
one.
Of
course,
I
had
plenty
of
new
thing
to
learn
because
most
of
the
academic
writing
requires
a
different
level
of
thinking
and
concentration.
For
example,
if
in
high
school
I
could
get
away
with
making
just
a
few
minor
revisions
to
the
first
draft,
in
college
the
situation
is
very
different.
Frequent
revisions
became
an
important
part
of
my
writing.
I
have
always
thought
that
if
i
did
not
get
it
the
first
time
correctly,
I
would
not
be
any
better
of
coming
back
to
my
paper
and
rethinking
it
again.
In
my
first
year
seminar,
when
we
were
asked
to
make
several
drafts
before
submitting
a
paper,
most
of
my
revisions
consisted
mostly
of
correcting
a
few
typos
and
rewriting
just
a
few
sentences.
I
realized
that
making
several
drafts
is
one
of
the
most
important
steps
in
producing
a
good
paper
in
my
English
110
class.
Our
professor
asked
us
to
write
several
versions
of
the
same
paper
that
had
to
be
written
from
several
view
points,
for
example
a
dialogue
versus
a
letter
to
the
editor.
Then
we
had
to
combine
the
best
parts
of
each
of
these
versions
to
create
the
final
paper
that
was
graded.
After
rereading
some
of
the
papers
just
a
few
days
later
i
saw
how
much
better
they
could
have
been
if
I
only
looked
at
them
once
again.
In
the
past
two
years
of
college
several
other
interesting
developments
took
place.
For
example,
I
switched
from
using
plain
old
pens
and
pencils
to
the
computer.
The
main
reason
for
this
is
that
computer
is
offers
a
lot
of
convenient
little
ways
that
save
time
and
effort.
It
is
easier
to
run
a
spellchecker
than
look
up
words
I
am
unsure
of
in
the
dictionary
every
time.
Yet,
once
in
a
while
I
still
have
that
longing
for
the
use
of
pen
and
I
carry
a
fountain
one
with
me
at
all
times.
Even
when
I
work
on
my
papers
I
tend
to
print
out
a
copy
first
and
then
edit
it
with
a
pencil.
I
guess
traditions
die
hard.
Being
a
college
student
also
made
me
understand
my
writing
capabilities.
I
am
very
comfortable
writing
long
reports
and
papers
that
require
extensive
research,
yet
I
am
not
as
sure
of
myself
when
writing
something
based
mainly
on
my
own
imagination.
This
realization
enabled
me
to
put
my
plans
for
the
future
into
a
clearer
perspective
since
I
know
the
things
I
am
better
at.
The
most
recent
step
upward
in
my
progress
as
a
writer
was
when
I
learned
that
i
have
been
selected
as
a
Writing
Associate.
It
meant
to
me
that
several
professors
not
only
trusted
in
my
ability
to
write,
but
also
believed
that
I
would
be
capable
of
helping
other
student
to
improve
their
writing.
I
hope
to
live
up
to
the
expectations
and
I
also
hope
to
learn
a
great
deal
more
from
this
experience
as
i
know
that
my
English
is
not
as
good
as
I'd
like
it
to
be.
