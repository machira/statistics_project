Attempting
to
analyze
last
year
as
a
writer,
I
realize
that
a
year
is
a
very
long
time.
In
the
past
twelve
months,
I
had
my
first
semester
experience
as
a
Writing
Associate,
took
a
course
introducing
me
to
literary
criticism
and
tools
for
exploring
a
text,
and,
during
a
semester
in
London,
took
an
English
course
at
a
different
college,
facing
a
new
set
of
guidelines
and
expectations
and
taking
the
opportunity
to
adapt
myself
and
develop
my
writing
style
in
a
new
environment.
From
these
varied
experiences,
I
found
my
habits
and
practices
changing.
As
a
new
WA,
I
understood
my
job
in
theory,
but
the
every-day
aspects
were
unpracticed.
I
was
assigned
to
an
FYS
course
on
Life
Writing,
a
course
requiring
students,
all
of
them
girls,
to
write
stories
of
their
own
lives
and
biographies
of
others'
lives.
The
professor
hoped
I
would
assist
them
with
what
he
saw
as
the
most
important
thing
they
should
learn:
how
to
construct,
follow,
and
support
a
strong
thesis.
Even
in
stories
of
their
own
lives,
the
students
needed
a
clear
plan,
a
purpose
to
follow
from
the
first
word
to
the
last.
Teaching
them
punctuation
was
not
my
responsibility,
nor
was
I
supposed
to
correct
their
theory;
I
was
a
reader,
separate
from
grading
and
teaching
the
course,
intended
to
help
students
improve
and
polish
their
writing.
At
first
my
assigned
students
were
unsure
of
the
purpose
of
our
meeting.
No
matter
what
the
professor
explained
or
what
I
offered
at
our
introduction,
it
was
difficult
for
them
to
know
what
to
do.
During
our
first
round
of
meetings
spent
looking
at
their
first
paper,
a
short
story
about
an
event
in
their
lives,
the
students
displayed
various
reactions.
Some
students
seemed
to
expect
me
to
read
their
paper
and
reach
an
epiphany
leading
to
perfection
and
ensuring
them
a
good
grade.
Several
students
were
very
involved
in
the
meetings,
coming
with
many
questions
and
concerns,
while
a
few
didn't
seem
to
care
what
I
suggested,
only
attending
because
the
professor
would
drop
their
score
a
full
grade
if
they
didn't
meet
with
me.
Some
students
were
unsatisfied
with
what
they
had
written,
looking
for
a
reader's
advice
or
directions
on
improvements.
Others
were
pleased
with
their
work,
but
were
willing
to
see
that
paragraphs
could
be
polished
and
improvements
could
be
considered.
Overall,
the
students
left
the
controls
in
my
hands,
not
sure
what
role
to
take.
Subsequently,
the
students
became
more
active
in
the
meetings
and
I
became
more
comfortable
with
my
position.
I
asked
them
to
come
with
questions,
with
at
least
one
concern
or
one
area
for
our
focus.
Starting
the
session
with
a
student's
concern
resulted
in
immediately
making
them
feel
actively
involved.
We
still
covered
areas
and
topics
I
introduced,
but
students
were
more
receptive
to
my
comments
and
questions
when
I
asked
them
first
for
input.
Over
the
course
of
fall
semester,
I
learned
that
though
my
purpose
was
the
same
for
all
students
I
worked
with,
I
could
do
my
job
better
by
remembering
that
each
student
was
a
different
case
and
each
piece
written
reflected
something
of
the
writer.
Meeting
with
students
for
hours,
the
writers
and
their
work
blurred
together;
I
learned
that
the
meetings
went
better
when
spaced
farther
apart,
with
time
in
between
to
focus
on
who
my
next
student
was,
what
I
had
done
with
them
previously,
and
what
they
had
said,
recalling
such
specifics
to
separate
and
distinguish
students.
I
had
one
student
who
didn't
want
my
help;
she
came
late
to
her
meeting,
sat
with
her
backpack
on,
said
little,
and
left
as
soon
as
she
could.
Several
other
students
wanted
to
spend
more
time
on
their
papers;
for
those,
we
would
make
more
than
one
appointment
or
schedule
a
longer
appointment.
The
rest
of
the
students
were
somewhere
between
the
two
extremes,
involved
in
the
meetings,
prepared
with
their
paper
and
a
question
or
two,
willing
to
listen
to
me,
and
answer
my
questions.
On
the
whole,
I
liked
meeting
with
them,
learning
over
the
course
of
the
semester
which
students
were
sensitive,
diffident,
or
in
need
of
more
help
in
certain
areas.
Acknowledging
that
each
half-hour
served
a
different
purpose
and
addressed
various
issues,
depending
on
the
student,
made
the
meetings
more
productive.
At
the
same
time,
I
was
taking
Literary
Questions,
a
course
introducing
me
to
different
schools
of
criticism
and
types
of
reading.
Reading
the
literature
and
accompanying
criticism
exposed
me
to
different
ways
of
analyzing
texts,
while
discussing
and
writing
about
the
theories
and
methods
fixed
them
firmly
in
my
mind.
I
began
learning
to
look
at
a
single
text
from
a
variety
of
viewpoints,
to
find
a
number
of
readings,
ask
specific
questions
of
the
text,
and
search
carefully
for
evidence
supporting
the
answers.
From
repetition
and
experience,
I
have
found
styles
of
criticism
which
suit
me
more
than
others,
some
which
I
can
practice
more
easily
and
discover
more
readily.
I
can
read
the
argument
of
a
critic
and
find
ways
to
refute
an
established
reading,
but
I
also
realize
that
another
person
could
quickly
come
along
and
do
the
same
to
my
own
reading.
I've
found
the
process
more
humbling
than
paralyzing.
Each
reader
can
make
the
text
his
or
her
own,
finding
a
meaning
and
owning
the
text,
an
aspect
which
keeps
my
job
as
a
WA
interesting
as
well
-
no
paper
I
read
should
be
identical
to
any
other
when
everyone
can
make
their
own
reading.
Literary
Questions
looked
at
Shakespeare's
Hamlet
focusing
on
several
different
readings.
Through
the
historical
lens,
I
discovered
that
Hamlet's
reprimand
of
his
mother
for
her
hasty
marriage
to
his
uncle
was
not
because
he
wanted
someone
to
share
his
misery,
rather
because,
to
Renaissance
minds,
two
months
was
an
inappropriately
short
time
to
mourn
one's
husband;
in
addition,
Renaissance
viewers
would
also
remember
the
religious
conviction
which
got
Henry
VIII
in
trouble
with
the
Catholic
Church
-
the
immorality
of
marriage
of
a
man's
wife
to
his
brother.
Using
a
psychological
context
and
the
ideas
of
Freud,
the
class
explored
Hamlet's
relationship
with
his
father
and
mother
and
how
these
bonds
caused
many
of
the
difficulties
Hamlet
faced,
not
only
in
the
pursuit
of
revenge
but
in
his
search
for
something
resembling
love
with
Ophelia.
Finally,
in
our
midterm
exam,
we
addressed
the
character
of
Ophelia;
I
posited
that
Ophelia
attempted
to
separate
herself
from
the
confining
court
environment,
to
not
be
held
under
her
father's
thumb,
and
it
was
only
with
Hamlet
that
she
could,
and
needed
to,
speak
her
mind,
reverting
to
submissive
stock
answers
to
satisfy
all
others.
Though
I
had
read
Hamlet
prior
to
taking
Literary
Questions,
I
had
never
given
so
much
time,
thought,
or
energy
to
understanding
the
play.
While
I
had
once
supposed
that
there
was
only
one
meaning
in
a
text,
now
I
learned
that
a
single
text
could
have
multiple
readings,
depending
on
how
one
looked
at
the
text
and
through
what
lens
a
work
was
examined.
We
also
read
The
Yellow
Wallpaper
in
Literary
Questions
and
discussed
feminist
interpretations,
with
an
assignment
to
give
an
alternative
reading,
either
historical,
Marxist,
or
Freudian,
for
the
story,
though
I
had
trouble
seeing
it
as
anything
other
than
a
feminist
text.
Spring
semester,
in
a
course
titled
Women's
Writing
In
The
Late
19th
Century,
taught
at
Middlesex
University,
I
continued
to
build
on
skills
learned
in
Literary
Questions.
I
learned
that
one
can
separate
the
novel
from
the
period
and
the
life
of
the
author
and
look
only
at
the
work.
I
was
a
sophomore
from
an
American
college
sitting
in
London,
attending
a
third
year
English
class
on
gender
and
writing,
painfully
aware
I
was
in
a
class
with
older,
more
experienced
students,
most
graduating
in
June
with
the
British
equivalent
of
an
American
Bachelor's
degree.
I
felt
overwhelmed
and
anxious
about
the
pressure
of
having
a
grade
based
solely
on
two
papers,
and
the
changes
in
spelling,
with
U's
popping
up
all
over,
the
size
of
printer
paper,
and
the
switched
keys
on
the
computer
keyboards,
were
the
least
of
my
problems.
My
greatest
concern
was
the
change
in
expectations,
those
of
my
professors,
my
peers,
and
myself.
At
Middlesex
University,
students
were
given
a
great
deal
of
independence,
and
it
was
expected
we
would
be
successful.
There
was
overall
less
administrator
and
professor
involvement
and
greatly
reduced
professor
availability
by
comparison
with
Lafayette,
and
the
presumption
was
students
would
show
a
high
level
of
development,
maturity,
and
original
thought
in
their
writing
and
discussion.
I
was
to
discover
how
well
I
could
adapt
and
thrive
in
an
unfamiliar
environment,
in
and
out
of
class.
Women's
Writing
entailed
a
single
three-hour
class
meeting
divided
into
two
parts,
one
third
of
the
time
spent
in
lecture
and
the
remainder
in
seminar.
During
lecture,
the
professor
would
introduce
the
text,
providing
some
background
information
about
the
author
of
the
book
under
discussion,
the
history
of
the
time
period
in
which
the
piece
was
written,
and
the
works
and
responses
of
contemporaries
and
later
critics.
Concepts
would
be
introduced
and
the
student
was
expected
to
take
notes
and
ask
questions
as
the
need
arose.
The
lectures
were
fast
paced,
with
most
students
either
taking
few
notes,
mostly
names
and
dates,
or
furiously
scribbling
the
entire
time.
Students
were
expected
to
do
outside
research,
extra
reading
to
supplement
the
module's
texts,
to
provide
further
background
for
discussion
and
written
assignments.
Professors
required
students'
written
work
to
support
an
argument
not
only
with
references
from
critical
works
in
addition
to
the
main
text
discussed.
This
was
something
I
began
learning
in
Literary
Questions,
but
it
was
further
expanded
upon
in
the
spring
semester.
In
our
essays,
my
first
semester
professor
wanted
us
to
engage
and
respond
to
a
critic,
using
and
reacting
to
someone
else's
work
on
our
topic;
while
the
professor
may
have
hoped
we
would
choose
an
author
who
disagreed
with
us,
it
was
often
easier
to
find
works
which
would
reinforce
what
we
wrote.
In
London,
by
comparison,
the
professor
wanted
students
to
find
a
critic
to
disagree
with,
using
that
as
a
starting
point,
to
introduce
and
advocate
our
own
ideas
by
contrast,
forcing
us
to
more
firmly
prove
our
point.
Finding
a
dissenting
opinion
took
more
research
time,
but
I
felt
I
had
accomplished
more
in
the
papers
I
wrote
spring
semester,
for
having
done
the
extra
work.
Throughout
the
course,
I
encountered
a
concept
at
first
difficult
to
define
-
gender.
It
took
me
half
the
semester
to
understand
what
the
term
meant
and
to
be
able
to
use
it
in
discussion
and
writing.
It
was
in
this
course
that
I
took
at
step
from
being
a
student
who
was
perplexed
by
feminist
criticism
to
one
who
could
separate
gender
from
sexuality
and
further
compare
gender
and
class
at
once
within
a
text.
When
I
was
introduced
to
the
idea
of
'gender,'
I
faced
a
complicated
situation.
Unlike
Marxist
criticism
which
I
could
recognize
by
familiarity
with
the
beliefs
of
critics
and
proponents,
it
is
not
enough
to
know
the
values
and
conventions.
Examining
gender
in
a
text
is
more
like
looking
for
a
lipstick
smear
on
a
glass
and
wondering
not
what
shade
it
originally
was
but
why
the
shade
was
chosen.
Sexuality
is
biological
while
gender
is
something
created
by
society
and
imposed
upon
members
of
a
specific
sex.
Finding
gender
in
a
text
is
discerning
the
shade
of
lipstick,
recognizing
that
certain
beliefs
are
reflected
by
the
text
and
presented
by
the
author
in
the
text;
discovering
the
"why,"
the
meaning
and
shape
behind
the
lipstick,
is
more
difficult.
The
author
could
have
used
accepted
ideas
about
gender
without
believing
them,
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
a
version
of
reality
as
it
seemed,
or
the
author
could
have
been
unaware
that
the
ideas
he
or
she
lived
with
were
being
presented
in
the
world
being
written.
Another
option
was
that
the
conventions
and
values
about
gender
are
doubled,
found
in
the
text
and
encountered
there
by
each
reader
and
additionally
brought
to
the
text
and
invented
by
each
reader.
By
the
end
of
the
term,
I
was
better
able
to
use
the
term
'gender'
and
more
comfortable
comparing
it
with
other
schools
of
criticism.
Prior
to
this
course,
I
had
never
understood
the
relationship
between
sexuality
and
gender,
unaware,
by
absence
of
consideration,
that
they
were
they
were
distinct
concepts.
There
were
additional
differences
I
faced
in
my
Women's
Writing
class
in
London;
professors
had
different
requirements
for
writing
papers.
I
had
anticipated
a
change
in
formatting
for
footnotes,
citations,
and
inserted
passages
from
a
text,
but
professors
wanted
a
degree
more
summary
of
the
text
being
discussed
and
a
specific
length
in
student
essays.
London
Professors
also
wanted
essays
of
a
specific
length,
measuring
papers
in
words
rather
than
pages,
not
allowing
students
to
be
rescued
by
reducing
or
increasing
the
size
and
style
of
font
used.
They
demanded
the
same
level
of
explanation
and
attention
to
detail
as
Lafayette
professors,
but
made
additional
requests.
In
my
discussion
of
gender
and
class
in
Mary
Barton,
my
professor
suggested
that
I
expand
on
my
summary
of
the
story,
extending
it
from
a
brief
two
sentences
to
a
more
detailed
four
or
five.
The
additional
information
changed
the
audience
of
my
essay,
better
equipping
anyone
reading
my
paper
to
understand
it
instead
of
limiting
my
audience
to
those
well
acquainted
with
the
text.
Looking
over
a
draft
of
my
first
paper
with
me,
my
Women's
Writing
professor
suggested
that
there
should
be
more
and
different
examples.
Though
she
said
most
of
my
paragraphs
were
worth
keeping
and
additional
examples
could
be
added,
she
thought
my
paper
seemed
too
long.
In
writing
the
two
papers
for
my
London
English
professor,
I
practiced
narrowing
down
and
carefully
selecting
examples
to
support
my
thesis,
choosing
the
few
that
worked
the
best
and
putting
the
most
effort
into
their
discussion.
As
a
writer
still
having
difficulties
being
concise,
spring
semester
was
a
challenge
-
it
asked
me
to
adapt
to
a
new
environment
and
pick
up
skills
that
would
help
me
regardless
of
where
I
was
writing
or
whom
I
was
addressing.
This
past
year,
through
WA
work,
Literary
Questions,
and
Women's
Writing,
I
practiced
keeping
the
assignment
in
mind
while
writing,
remembering
the
question
I
was
answering
to
help
keep
me
on
track
while
I
composed.
When
I
worked
with
students,
a
few
of
them
would
forget
their
purpose
in
the
paper,
ending
up
with
a
concluding
thesis
which
differed
from
their
original
one.
My
suggestion
to
them
-
return
often
to
the
question
being
answered
-
was
advice
I
began
practicing
myself.
I
also
found
that
when
I
would
ask
others
to
read
my
papers,
I
would
have
specific
concerns
in
mind.
I
would
ask
others
if
they
could
find
a
thesis,
how
strong
my
thesis
was,
how
well
I
supported
it,
or
if
my
examples
supported
my
thesis
effectively.
Without
realizing
it,
I
was
remembering
to
ask
the
type
of
questions
I
hoped
for
and
wanted
to
expect
from
the
students
I
assisted.
This
summer,
I
helped
a
friend
with
her
final
paper
for
a
Shakespeare
class.
I
found
myself
disagreeing
with
what
she
wrote,
internally
arguing
with
the
stance
she
had
taken,
finding
that
it
conflicted
with
the
response
I
had
to
the
same
piece
of
literature.
However,
instead
of
trying
to
correct
her
theory
and
teach
her
another
way
to
look
at
the
text,
to
make
her
agree
with
me
or
show
her
how
her
view
could
be
refuted,
I
determined
that
this
was
neither
my
place
nor
my
job.
I
was
supposed
to
help
her
make
the
paper
better,
to
improve
on
the
arguments
and
polish
what
she
already
had,
not
reconstruct
it
to
suit
me;
even
though
I
helped
on
her
paper,
it
was
supposed
to
remain
her
creation,
reflecting
her
thoughts
and
style.
It's
difficult
not
to
make
comments
or
simply
show
peers
what
they
should
have
done
in
a
paper;
these
are
often
corrections
I
would
make
if
the
work
were
my
own.
With
my
experience
as
a
WA,
I
am
learning
how
to
help
others
with
their
writing
without
interfering
with
their
developing
style.
I
ask
myself
and
my
own
readers
questions
I
find
useful
to
ask
students
I
help;
the
result
is
I
have
come
to
adopt
practices
and
notice
things
about
myself
as
a
writer
that
I
had
missed
before.
