Literacy
Narrative
Writing
Across
the
Pond
I
spent
the
Fall
of
last
year
at
Lafayette,
and
WAOed
as
usual,
and
then
in
January
left
for
Oxford
and
the
sleepless
marathon
that
would
be
the
next
six
months.
NWriting
as
a
WAO
means
something
entirely
different
after
a
six
month
stint
at
Oxford,
an
experience
at
once
painfully
humbling
and
terrifically
inspiring.
The
tutorial
system
pairs
students
(NreadersO)
one-on-one
with
a
professors
(NtutorsO),
for
each
class
(NtutorialO).
Primary
tutorials
meet
once
a
week,
secondary
tutorials
every
other
week,
and
each
student
reads
for
one
primary
and
one
secondary.
Tutorials
last
one
hour
each,
and
consist
of
reciting,
out
loud,
a
ten
page
paper
written
during
the
intervening
week.
Thus,
with
a
primary
and
secondary,
the
page
count
alternates
from
ten
to
twenty
pages
every
other
week,
totaling
120
pages
by
the
end
of
each
term.
I
was
there
for
two
terms.
ThatOs
240
pages
of
writing
in
a
six
month
span.
I
think
of
it
now
as
Nacademic
boot
camp,O
and
after
watching
the
Ivy
kids
pulling
their
hair
over
many
sleepless
nights
and
pots
of
tea
D
or
coffee
when
we
could
get
it
D
at
the
amount
of
work,
I
think
the
label
is
warranted.
It
puts
in
intimidating
perspective
on
the
amount
of
work
that
might
be
demanded,
say,
of
a
British
graduate
student,
or
a
full-time
professor,
if
every
three-term
Oxford
year
demands
some
360
pages
of
academic
writing
from
its
undergraduates
alone.
As
academia
seems
to
be
my
way
on,
the
ability
to
write
prolifically,
articulately,
and
quickly
in
the
way
that
Oxford
required
has
become
a
must.
Whatever
insights
IOve
gained
from
doing
exactly
that
for
six
months,
and
their
impact
on
my
work
as
a
WA,
I
hope
you
find
interesting.
It
was
business
as
usual
WAOing
during
the
Fall
of
O09,
and
my
third
semester
of
conferencing
served
mainly
to
reaffirm
many
of
the
pedagogical
insights
I
had
gained
from
my
first
two.
Personability
is
paramount,
and
remembering
even
one
small
detail
about
each
student
(written
down
if
need
be)
enhances
almost
every
aspect
of
a
conference.
The
initial
thirty
seconds
of
Nso
how
has
football
been
going?O
relaxes
a
student
writer,
invites
them
to
speak
on
a
topic
they
are
knowledgeable
about,
and
levels
the
authority
playing
field
by
establishing
that
you
are
just
a
student
too.
Fall
reaffirmed
the
idea
introduced
to
me
the
previous
spring
that
evaluative
feedback
centered
on
effort
is
far
more
effective
than
feedback
focused
on
intrinsic
ability.
I
have
seen
the
negative
consequences
of
calling
a
student,
early
in
the
semester,
a
Ngood
writerO
and
the
benefits
instead
of
praising
a
students
effort
in
thesis
formation,
in
organization,
in
word
choice,
in
flow,
etc.
Effort-based
feedback
provides
a
specific
area
for
students
to
zero
in
on
and
continue
doing
well,
while
preventing
an
inflated
ego
and
the
possible
stagnation
that
can
result.
My
overriding
thought
as
to
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
give
evaluative
feedback
at
all,
which
is
something
of
a
debate,
is
that
it
need
of
course
be
made
on
an
individual
basis.
A
shy
or
unconfident
student
can
significantly
benefit
from
positive
evaluative
feedback
D
that
is,
effort
centered
feedback
balanced
with
an
appropriate
amount
of
constructive
criticism.
There
is
also
no
feeling
quite
like
making
a
very
general
comment
about
a
student
paper
and
being
caught
without
a
specific
example
of
what
you
mean.
The
blank
looks
will
haunt
you.
General
or
vague
comments
are
usually
not
quite
as
effective
as
more
pointed
ones,
and
having
a
specific
illustrative
example
of
what
youOre
talking
about
prepared
beforehand
helps
the
student
and
keeps
you
out
of
embarrassing
situations.
Reciting
a
piece
of
writing
aloud
for
on
the
spot
evaluation
is
no
small
feat,
nothing
short
of
terrifying
in
fact,
especially
given
the
expertise
of
your
audience
should
you
happen
to
recite
something
during
an
Oxford
tutorial.
What
I
found
was
that
after
a
few
weeks
my
writing
began
to
change.
The
process
of
planting
words
on
paper
became
more
auditory,
and
my
writing
process
pivoted
even
more
on
intended
audience.
I
found
myself
speaking
the
writing
to
myself
more
distinctly
as
I
wrote
it,
and
consistently
reading
it
out
loud
to
myself
while
composing
it.
It
is
a
tactic
that
everyone
has
heard
since
grammar
school,
yet
until
being
forced
to
employ
it
on
a
regular
basis
I
had
never
taken
it
seriously.
It
is
advice
I
would
give
any
new
WA
to
employ
in
their
writing
and
to
pass
on
to
their
student
writers.
If
a
student
paper
is
riddled
with
grammar
concerns,
proofing
mistakes,
sentential
confusion,
or
logical
missteps,
reading
out
loud
can
be
wildly
effective.
It
should
have
come
as
little
surprise.
I
had
been
asking
student
writers
to
read
aloud
their
theses
and
any
particularly
confusing
passages
from
their
papers
for
a
long
while
D
and
to
great
effect.
Yet
I
had
always
considered
the
mental
recitation
of
my
own
papers
sufficient
proofing.
Reading
aloud
each
week,
my
ear
caught
passages
that
another
reader
might
find
confusing,
and
my
tongue
tripped
over
sentential
constructions
that
even
I
couldnOt
quite
palate.
Reading
aloud
to
someone
else
simply
adds
a
second
perspective
with
a
second
pair
of
ears,
doubling
the
effectiveness
of
the
technique.
Reading
a
paper
out
loud
is
invaluable.
Reading
a
paper
out
loud
to
someone
else
is
even
more
so.
The
amount
of
effort
required
to
print
and
read
a
paper
aloud
is
minimal,
the
benefits
are
not.
Simple.
Week
by
week
I
was
also
required
to
print
out
my
papers
the
night
before
each
tutorial,
giving
me
a
chance
to
read
my
work
on
paper
before
turning
it
in.
This
process
proved
the
suspicion
I
had
long
held
that
proofing
on
paper
is
for
some
reason
far
more
effective
than
proofing
on
a
screen.
With
a
single
read
over
I
could
effectively
WA
myself
D
a
unimpressive
process,
and
again
an
old
tactic
affirmed
through
repetition
to
be
effective.
Most
of
these
insights
are
ones
that
introduced
themselves
prior
to
my
time
at
Oxford,
only
to
be
corroborated
or
controverted
according
to
their
effectiveness.
An
entirely
new
idea,
almost
a
maxim
of
sorts,
that
still
rings
with
me
from
Oxford
concerns
flowery
language
and
clarity.
Generally
speaking,
I
found
the
English
to
be
a
people
of
greater
wit,
verbosity,
and
overall
rhetorical
prowess
than
their
American
cousins.
As
such,
the
complexity
of
their
prose,
even
at
an
undergraduate
level,
is
incredible.
I
went
to
a
recitation
lecture
at
the
end
of
the
spring
term,
where
undergraduates
read
sections
of
their
senior
theses
for
evaluation
to
prep
for
their
final
exams,
or
Ncollections.O
I
was
blown
away
not
only
by
the
intricacy
and
organization
of
their
arguments,
but
by
the
clarity
of
their
ideas.
Somehow
virtually
every
reader
had
laid
down
that
resplendent
British
rhetoric
in
such
a
way
that
every
thought
came
across
ornately
yet
intelligibly.
Reflecting
then
on
my
own
writing,
I
looked
for
such
a
balance
between
ornament
and
transparency.
What
I
found
in
many
of
my
papers
was
an
overabundance
of
beautiful
yet
flowery
writing
used
to
stretch
a
few
ideas,
or
to
mask
the
fact
that
there
were
so
few.
The
readersO
papers
were
rich
in
both.
I
took
a
tutorial
exclusively
on
Friedrich
Nietzsche,
my
only
Oxford
course
in
Philosophy,
and
at
the
first
meeting
my
tutor
summed
up
everything
I
been
thinking
NJust
say
it.O
What
hit
all
of
us
hardest
at
Oxford
was
the
sheer
amount
of
writing.
I
took
some
sick
consolation
in
the
fact
that
the
Ivy
League
students
were
pulling
their
hair
just
as
much
as
the
rest
of
us,
and
then
proceeded
to
pull
mine
as
well.
It
is
impossible
now
to
consider
a
five
or
ten-page
paper
within
a
two
or
three
week
assignment
window
in
any
way
demanding.
The
weekly
routine
was
more
a
nine-to-five
job
than
a
course
load.
Monday
through
Saturday
I
spent
in
the
library
(as
the
Bodleian
is
closed
on
Sundays)
from
as
early
as
possible
until
dinner
at
seven
oOclock,
still
needing
an
all-nighter
the
evening
before
each
tutorial
to
finish,
print,
and
proof
the
paper
I
had
written
that
week.
The
writing
was
a
long
process,
detailed,
and
heavily
researched.
Cramming
a
full
argument
into
five
pages
is
now
challenging
more
for
its
brevity
than
anything
else,
and
although
I
remember
a
time
when
that
was
not
the
case,
it
certainly
is
now.
It
affords
me
a
strange
kind
of
perspective
on
the
terror
I
remember
as
a
Freshman
asked
to
write
my
first
research
paper.
Ten
pages
seemed
impossible.
I
expect
that
reading
WA
papers
might
be
quicker
and
easier
now,
and
also
worry
that
empathizing
with
a
student
writer
struggling
to
make
a
page
count
will
be
a
further
step
back
in
time
than
it
was
previously.
Still,
the
same
techniques
used
for
expanding
a
ten
page
paper
are
applicable
for
a
fiver,
and
certainly
those
tips
and
tricks
that
aid
student
writers
in
their
writing
process
are
still
fresh
in
my
mind.
Recently
I
have
stepped
back
into
a
field
of
writing
that
I
have
not
done
to
such
a
degree
since
high
school
D
personal
essays
and
application
writing.
Highly
self-reflective
and
often
irritatingly
brief,
they
require
that
I
paint
a
complete
picture
of
myself
on
paper
in
say,
five
hundred
words
or
less.
No
small
feat.
I
find
myself
quite
bad
at
it
actually,
having
written
for
so
long
at
a
great
distance
from
myself
personally.
Academic
papers,
especially
those
I
wrote
at
Oxford,
must
be
written
from
a
position
of
adopted
authority
D
whether
oneOs
knowledge
of
the
topic
at
hand
warrants
such
authority
or
not.
The
result,
at
least
for
me,
when
three
years
of
this
condition
was
applied
to
personal
writing
was
an
air
of
condescension
that
my
academic
advisors
at
Lafayette
had
described
at
deeply
offputting.
I
have
had
to
step
back
and
remember
how
to
write
as
though
speaking
directly
to
someone,
with
a
far
more
personal,
rolling,
often
informal
style.
I
am
asked
to
write
far
closer
to
the
chest
than
I
have
in
some
time
and
to
speak
emotively
about
my
academic
trajectory
and
personal
interests.
Needless
to
say,
it
is
an
adjustment.
What
I
have
been
reminded
as
I
begin
the
process,
and
begin
to
receive
feedback,
is
how
deeply
personal
any
form
of
writing
is.
Composing
an
essay,
academic
or
not,
demands
a
great
degree
of
oneOs
self
be
contributed
simply
by
virtue
of
the
medium.
A
writer
receiving
criticism
about
a
piece
of
writing
is,
perhaps
more
fundamentally,
a
person
receiving
feedback
about
him
or
herself.
Writing
is
thinking
on
paper,
thus
a
WA
is
commenting
on
the
way
a
student
thinks
when
commenting
on
their
paper.
This
was
a
lesson
I
learned
during
my
first
semester
of
WA
work.
I
had
been
slightly
too
harsh
with
a
female
studentOs
truly
irredeemable
paper,
and
although
I
was
sure
to
phrase
all
my
comments
in
the
form
of
constructive
criticism,
her
reaction
was
extreme.
In
commenting
on
the
paper
I
had
thought
I
was
at
least
partially
diverting
the
brunt
of
my
feedback
from
the
writer
personally,
yet,
again,
by
virtue
of
what
a
paper
is
D
namely
a
representation
of
its
author
D
all
of
my
comments
sunk
deeper
than
I
anticipated.
After
several
sessions
of
feedback
on
my
personal
statements
and
applications,
irregardless
of
the
fact
that
the
feedback
was
entirely
constructive
and
from
people
with
my
best
interests
at
heart,
I
felt
quite
powerfully
the
way
she
must
have
been
feeling.
ItOs
like
being
exposed
under
a
harsh
and
unrelenting
microscope.
A
new
WA
should
be
immediately
aware
of
how
that
feels,
hopefully
remembering
what
it
was
like
to
have
been
WAOd
as
a
Freshman.
Sensitivity
on
this
particular
point
I
think
is
critical.
Given
that
I
have
been
away
from
WAing
for
a
semester,
I
am
sure
there
will
be
a
bit
of
rust
to
shake
off
when
I
come
back
to
work
in
the
Fall.
Yet
given
my
intense
writing
experience
at
Oxford,
and
this
recent
rehashing
of
an
old
writing
style,
I
think
I
have
been
stretched
in
new
ways
that
can
only
enrich
my
performance.
To
be
honest,
this
narrative
has
pulled
my
head
back
into
the
game
quite
a
bit;
it
reminded
me
how
to
use
Moodle
if
nothing
else.
Honestly,
though
it
has
brought
back
my
semesters
in
the
CWP
and
many
of
the
old
faces
from
WA
conferences
past.
Allot
of
my
old
tricks
and
tactics
have
come
back,
some
of
which
I
have
shared
here,
and
the
often
trying
demands
of
a
WA
week
are
once
again
quite
real.
Over
all,
IOm
optimistic
and
anxious
for
the
upcoming
year.
