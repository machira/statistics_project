Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative
2011
I
knew
I
wanted
to
become
a
WA
after
my
very
first
conference
with
my
writing
associate
freshman
year.
The
conference
was
unlike
anything
I
had
ever
experienced
before.
Sure,
I
had
had
conferences
and
paper
workshops
in
high
school,
yet
they
were
seen
more
as
an
opportunity
to
socialize
or
draw
cartoons
on
your
friendsO
papers
and
less
as
a
useful
academic
exercise.
These
thirty
minutes
were
different;
they
were
constructive
and
beneficial.
The
conference
with
an
upper
classman
immediately
exposed
me
to
the
style
of
writing
at
the
collegiate
level,
as
well
as
the
useful
opportunities
available
to
Lafayette
students.
Since
becoming
a
WA,
I
have
learned
a
lot
about
various
styles
of
writing,
different
pedagogical
approaches
to
the
writing
process,
and
the
benefits
of
constructive
criticism.
I
personally
used
to
be
quite
protective
and
even
defensive
when
it
came
to
my
papers.
I
took
any
critiques
personally,
since
I
typically
invested
quite
a
bit
of
time
and
energy
creating
papers.
My
experience
as
a
WA
has
changed
this
completely.
Seeing
the
positive
changes
that
I
can
do
upon
reading
other
studentsO
papers
has
taught
me
to
be
more
open
minded
about
my
own
papers.
Since
people
share
their
papers
with
me
all
the
time,
I
now
feel
more
comfortable
sharing
mine
with
my
peers
as
well.
I
know
longer
see
criticism
as
someone
imposing
their
own
views
on
me,
but
rather
as
a
bridge
to
creativity
and
an
opportunity
for
improvement.
Not
only
has
my
outlook
on
constructive
criticism
change,
but
also
I
feel
as
if
my
writing
process
has
evolved
throughout
my
time
as
a
WA.
Although
I
always
considered
myself
a
good
writer,
I
do
not
think
that
I
was
good
at
embracing
and
improving
my
writing
process.
I,
like
most
students
I
believe,
tended
to
focus
on
the
finish
line,
the
final
product,
rather
than
the
brainstorming
and
actual
construction
of
the
piece.
The
discussions
I
have
had
with
the
students
I
have
worked
with
revealed
to
me
the
invaluable
role
the
writerOs
process
plays
in
the
creation
of
an
essay.
As
a
result
of
some
advice
I
received
from
other
WAs,
I
typically
begin
my
conferences
by
asking
the
student
how
they
approached
the
assignment,
what
their
process
was.
Overtime,
I
began
to
realize
the
importance
of
their
answer.
Those
who
responded
something
along
the
lines
of,
NI
donOt
know
I
just
started
writing
and
wanted
to
answer
all
the
questions
on
the
assignmentO
typically
presented
somewhat
disorganized
and
unsupported
papers.
In
contrast,
those
who
would
reply
something
such
as
NWell
I
thought
about
what
the
assignment
was
looking
for,
then
used
my
sources
to
shape
my
argumentO
had
a
much
more
fluid,
cogent
paper.
While
this
is
a
generalization,
there
definitely
does
seem
to
be
a
pattern
indicating
the
different
effects
oneOs
process
can
have
on
the
quality
of
the
finished
product.
Thus,
not
only
did
I
use
the
information
I
had
gained
during
staff
meetings,
but
also
past
experience
from
WA
conferences
to
offer
suggestions
to
students
on
how
to
improve
their
papers
by
first
fine
tuning
and
strengthening
their
process
of
writing
papers.
This,
in
turn,
forced
me
to
reflect
on
my
own
process.
How
do
I
approach
papers?
What
is
my
typical
course
of
action?
When
are
my
papers
the
most
successful?
I
increasingly
asked
myself
these
questions,
and
over
time,
shaped
my
process
into
one
that
I
am
cognoscente
of
and
comfortable
with.
Personally,
I
perform
to
the
best
of
my
ability
when
I
get
a
clear
picture
of
what
the
Professor
is
looking
for,
either
by
discussing
it
with
the
professor
one
on
one
or
by
re-reading
the
prompt/assignment.
Next
I
make
a
quick
outline,
get
all
my
sources
and
favorite
quotes,
and
start
playing
around
with
organization.
The
next
step
in
my
process
is
to
create
a
draft,
and
have
it
finished
one
week
before
the
due
date.
While
this
may
seem
odd
or
unnecessarily
early
for
most
people,
it
works
for
me.
This
way,
I
have
a
whole
week
to
revise,
which,
in
my
opinion
after
being
a
WA
for
two
years,
is
the
most
important
step.
This
is
what
works
for
me.
I
have
created
and
molded
a
process
that
enables
me
to
create
the
best
paper
I
can.
I
think
that
a
good
WA
conference
focuses
on
the
studentOs
own
personal
process,
and
maybe
ways
to
slightly
alter
it
so
as
to
leave
the
student
not
only
with
an
improved
paper,
but
also
with
a
process
that
will
continue
to
yield
stronger
papers
throughout
college
and
even
well
into
the
future.
After
two
years
of
working
as
a
WA,
I
have
learned
what
types
of
questions
or
approaches
make
a
successful
conference.
I
remember
my
very
first
conference
very
clearly.
The
student
sat
down
and
I
laid
down
his
paper
with
my
notes
on
it
in
front
of
him.
This
was
my
first
mistake.
The
student
instantly
set
his
gaze
to
my
notes
on
his
paper,
and
I
lost
his
attention
right
away.
First
conference,
first
mistake,
and
first
lesson:
do
not
make
a
lot
of
notes
on
the
studentsO
papers.
We
also
discussed
this
in
WA
staff
meetings
where
veterans
reported
similar
results
and
made
a
strong
point:
that
that
paper
is
their
work,
and
that
we
should
not
tamper
with
othersO
property.
Thus,
I
think
a
successful
WA
conference
has
a
paper
clean
of
WA
notes,
that
way
the
student
can
only
see
what
he
or
she
has
written,
and
see
the
improvements
that
can
be
made
with
it
on
their
own.
A
successful
WA
conference,
in
my
opinion,
also
requires
energy
and
confidence
on
the
part
of
the
writing
associate.
Many
students
have
a
lot
going
on
during
WA
conferences,
and
thus,
their
energy
may
be
low
or
they
might
be
distracted
with
more
pressing
assignments
or
looming
exams.
While
the
WA
cannot
control
the
studentOs
energy
levels,
he
or
she
can
control
his
or
her
own.
I
have
found
that,
if
a
student
comes
in
lethargic
and
uninterested
I
start
off
with
asking
them
about
how
things
are
going
and
try
to
give
some
of
my
energy
to
them.
When
they
see
that
the
writing
associate
is
excited
to
talk
about
improvements
that
can
be
made
to
the
paper,
they
will
likewise
become
more
interested
than
if
the
WA
also
comes
in
tired
and
distracted
with
other
work.
Confidence
is
also
important.
I
remember
when
I
was
a
freshman
with
my
WA,
I
was
impressed
by
how
she
seemed
so
confident
in
her
point
of
view.
For
example,
she
would
say
something
such
as,
see
how
this
sounds
much
more
clear,
which
was
much
more
inspiring
to
me
than
something
such
as,
I
donOt
know
maybe
something
like
this
could
make
it
better.
If
you
are
confident
in
the
studentOs
paper
and
your
advice
to
them,
they
will
consequently
be
more
confident
in
their
paper
and
the
direction
they
are
taking
it
in.
One
of
the
most
useful
tips
that
I
got
during
my
WA
training
was
to
embrace
the
awkward
silence.
I
remember
Professor
Tatu
and
veteran
WAs
using
this
phrase
and
describing
the
importance
of
sitting
through
a
potentially
awkward
silence
in
order
to
get
the
student
engaged
in
the
discussion
of
their
paper.
Although
I
was
unsure
at
first
as
to
whether
I
could
weather
the
storm
of
an
awkward
silence
and
resist
the
temptation
to
talk
about
what
I
think
about
the
paper,
I
force
myself
to
do
it,
and
have
reaped
the
rewards
of
it
every
time.
It
forces
students
to
vocalize
their
feelings
about
the
paper
and
the
assignment
and
often
helps
them
see
why
a
certain
phrase
is
awkward
or
a
why
a
paragraph
does
not
flow.
When
you
ask
a
student
what
they
mean
in
a
certain
muddled
section,
it
also
creates
the
golden
opportunity
cherished
by
every
WA
to
say,
why
donOt
you
just
say
that!
That
is
much
clearer!
Also,
when
students
feel
comfortable
communicating
with
someone
else
about
their
paper,
they
can
become
more
detached
from
it,
and
get
an
outside
view
of
how
it
might
be
improved.
Overall,
my
time
as
a
WA
has
been
extremely
rewarding.
I
have
met
new
people,
helped
students
improve
their
writing
process,
enhanced
my
own
writing
and
have
learned
a
lot
about
conference
pedagogy.
However,
there
have
certainly
been
some
frustrating
times
as
a
WA.
The
most
common
of
which
is
the
classic
situation
of
being
stood
up.
There
is
nothing
more
annoying
than
having
lots
of
tests
to
study
for
and
papers
to
write
and
going
to
Pardee
and
waiting
for
20
minutes
only
to
have
no
one
show
up.
While
discussing
a
penalty
such
as
a
reduced
letter
grade
with
your
partner
professor
can
prevent
this,
it
nevertheless
seems
to
be
an
inevitable
part
of
the
job.
The
only
thing
you
can
do
is
to
make
sure
to
send
reminder
emails/texts
and
bring
homework
with
you
just
in
case.
Another
unfortunately
irritating
part
of
the
job
is
dealing
with
rude
or
defensive
students.
A
lot
of
time
students
will
not
be
open
to
changing
any
aspect
of
their
paper,
and
might
even
say
things
such
as
well
I
do
not
really
care
what
you
think,
I
think
I
will
get
a
good
grade.
It
is
hard
to
get
anything
achieved
in
a
conference
where
the
student
has
this
sort
of
attitude.
In
my
experience,
I
just
keep
going
and
try
to
illustrate
how
certain
changes
will
improve
the
paper
and
how
the
final
grade
is
actually
not
the
most
important
part
of
the
writing
conference.
Although
this
happens,
it
is
important
to
remain
confident
and
positive
about
the
paper,
and
if
things
get
worse
then
either
discuss
it
with
the
Professor
of
the
class
or
with
Professor
Tatu.
Despite
the
challenging
parts
of
the
job,
it
is
overall
a
wonderfully
rewarding
experience.
I
would
say
that
the
most
meaningful
experience
I
have
had
as
a
WA
is
with
a
student
who,
in
the
very
first
conference,
came
in
and
sat
down
and
was
very
distracted
and
uninterested.
After
I
had
asked
her
a
few
questions
she
said,
I
donOt
know,
I
am
a
terrible
writer,
I
hate
writing.
Needless
to
say,
the
first
conference
did
not
go
very
well,
but
I
felt
as
if
I
got
the
message
across
as
to
several
improvements
that
could
be
made
to
her
process
and
to
the
paper
itself.
In
my
second
conference
she
informed
me
that
she
had
taken
my
advice
and
had
actually
gotten
a
good
grade
on
a
paper
for
the
first
time.
She
was
more
excited
and
had
seen
a
glimpse
of
hope
that
maybe
she
was
not
a
terrible
writer.
In
that
conference,
I
would
read
a
certain
section
aloud
and
ask
her
what
she
meant.
She
heard
that
it
sounded
unclear,
so
she
reworded
it
and
said
something
along
the
lines
of,
I
am
getting
the
hang
of
this!
Now,
I
know
this
sounds
corny,
but
this
student
got
so
excited,
you
could
see
the
energy
and
confidence
in
her
eyes
as
she
asked
to
borrow
my
pen
and
write
down
her
new
ideas.
She
evolved
from
this
person
who
hated
writing,
or
thought
she
hated
writing
because
she
thought
she
was
a
terrible
writer;
all
she
needed
was
some
confidence
and
more
appreciation
for
the
writing
process.
Although
this
was
one
specific
case,
I
have
felt
that
I
have
improved
studentsO
confidence
several
times,
and
that
is
quite
a
rewarding
feeling.
Another
satisfying
aspect
of
being
a
WA
is
the
people
you
get
to
meet
and
the
relationships
you
can
establish
with
them.
Since
WAs
are
typically
assigned
to
two
classes
in
an
academic
year,
they
have
the
opportunity
to
meet
two
different
groups
of
about
thirty
students.
Sometimes
these
students
are
freshman
for
whom
you
feel
as
if
you
can
be
a
mentor,
and
sometimes
they
are
your
friends.
While
being
a
WA
to
one
of
your
friends
can
be
weird,
it
can
also
be
really
great,
because
they
can
see
you
doing
something
you
really
enjoy
and
trust
your
opinion.
One
of
the
best
experiences
for
me
as
a
WA
was
being
assigned
to
a
class
of
my
peers,
all
students
in
my
grade,
none
of
whom
I
really
knew.
I
was
able
to
make
new
friends,
and
learn
more
about
my
soon
to
be
graduating
class.
One
girl
in
my
grade
and
I
ended
up
getting
along
really
well
and
worked
great
with
each
other,
she
even
said
that
I
was
the
most
helpful
WA
she
had
ever
had!
When
I
am
told
things
like
this
from
new
friendships
made
during
WA
conferences,
it
really
makes
my
day
and
makes
me
appreciate
what
being
a
WA
is
all
about.
Finally,
a
wonderful
thing
about
being
a
WA
is
the
opportunity
to
help
students
for
whom
English
is
a
second
language.
In
the
drop-in
service
it
is
quite
common
to
have
non-native
English
speakers
asking
for
help
to
make
sure
their
papers
are
clear.
While
it
can
be
difficult
and
time
consuming
to
explain
certain
fixes
you
might
suggest,
it
is
quite
rewarding
when
you
see
them
excited
to
learn
another
aspect
of
the
English
language
and
American
essay
writing.
Once
again,
it
is
a
chance
to
increase
a
studentOs
self-confidence
in
an
area
where
they
might
feel
vulnerable
or
embarrassed.
Overall,
I
truly
enjoy
being
a
WA,
and
take
every
conference,
staff
meeting,
and
assigned
reading
seriously.
I
have
seen
how
this
job
can
transform,
not
only
studentsO
writing,
but
also
my
own
writing.
By
asking
people
to
be
open
with
me
about
their
writing
process
and
their
papers,
I,
in
turn,
have
been
able
to
be
more
open
with
my
own.
I
have
become
much
less
defensive
about
my
papers,
and
have
realized
the
importance
of
drafting
and
revising
and
being
open
to
changing
certain
aspects
of
my
papers
or
even
the
entire
thing,
if
necessary.
Being
a
WA
has
helped
my
confidence
as
a
writer
and
has
made
me
feel
like
an
important
part
of
the
Lafayette
community,
a
mentor
to
whom
freshman
or
other
students
can
seek
out
for
advice.
Even
if
some
students
I
have
worked
with
refused
to
take
my
advice
and
change
their
writing
process,
I
know
that
my
own
process
has
evolved,
and
I
learn
more
about
writing
and
the
writing
process
with
every
different
paper
I
read.
