WA
Workshop
Paper
MY
HISTORY
AS
A
WRITER
In
Kindergarten,
each
week
we
were
given
a
color
and
a
letter.
That
week
we
had
to
fill
a
whole
page
of
cut-out
pictures
that
we
found
either
using
that
color
or
beginning
with
that
letter.
That
was
probably
my
first
real
experience
with
writing.
However,
in
terms
of
stories
and
papers,
my
earliest
memory
of
writing
is
this
four
to
five
page
book
I
wrote
about
my
stuffed
animal.
It
was
my
favorite
childhood
stuffed
animal--a
purple
cow
that
sang
to
me
as
I
fell
asleep.
I
don't
even
have
that
toy
anymore
because
I
gave
it
to
my
ex-boyfriend
before
he
left
for
Williams
College.
The
mascot
at
Williams
College
is
a
purple
cow.
I
searched
my
house
for
this
book
to
give
some
actual
excerpts
but
unfortunately
I
could
not
find
it.
However,
throughout
my
search
I
did
find
a
few
stories
I
had
written
in
my
early
elementary
years.
The
first
item
I
came
across
was
this
stack
of
papers
titled
Color
Poetry.
This
I
do
not
remember
writing
but
I
determined
that
I
wrote
it
in
the
fourth
grade.
The
instructions
read:
make
a
list
of
things
that
can
all
be
a
color
you
choose.
Now
write
a
color
poem.
I
chose
white--quite
appropriately
too
because
white
has
always
been
my
favorite
color.
The
poem
I
came
up
with
(I
didn't
even
change
the
spelling)
is
this:
White
is
the
color
of
Joey's
pants./
White
is
the
color
of
my
teeth
growing
in./
White
is
the
color
of
glue
that
got
all
over
my
fingers./
White
is
the
color
of
my
Cabbage
Patch
Kids
sneakers./
White
is
the
color
of
the
sticker
on
my
pensles./
White
is
the
color
of
my
sisters
headband./
White
is
the
color
of
my
nextdoor
nabers
puppy
dog
named
Bo-Bo./
White
is
the
color
of
my
sister's
strips
on
her
coat./
White
is
the
color
of
snow
getting
cold./
White
is
the
color
of
a
magic
cloud
wishing
you
luck.
In
1985,
when
I
was
nine
years
old,
I
wrote
and
illustrated
a
story
that
got
a
laminated
cover
and
my
own
picture
and
bibliography
on
the
back
cover.
The
book
was
titled,
The
Story
of
the
Run
Away
TV.
I
dedicated
it
to
my
family
and
to
my
television
set
and
gave
it
to
my
family
for
Christmas
that
year.
The
story
was
three
chapters
long
and
fairly
descriptive.
When
I
read
it
over
I
was
actually
impressed
by
how
creative
and
imaginative
I
was
because
today
I
like
to
write
more
factual
papers
rather
than
fictional
tales.
This
story
is
about
a
TV
who
runs
away
to
get
ice
cream
when
the
young
girl
Kathy
and
her
mother
leave
the
house
to
go
shopping.
In
the
end,
the
TV
doesn't
get
caught
but
when
Kathy
and
her
mother
are
invited
over
to
Mrs.
Johnson's
house
for
the
afternoon,
they
won't
leave
the
home
because
they
have
suspicion
that
the
TV
might
go
bananas.
So,
they
spend
the
rest
of
their
days
at
home
watching
TV.
As
for
the
television
set,
he
can
never
run
away
again.
In
the
fourth
grade,
I
wrote
another
story
that
got
laminated
for
a
gift.
This
one
was
called,
A
Day
of
Fantasy.
It
was
another
fictional
tale
about
three
children
who
run
away
when
their
mother
leaves
to
go
shopping.
Being
curious
children,
they
spot
a
rainbow
and
decide
to
follow
it.
Instead
of
finding
a
pot
of
gold
at
the
end,
they
find
a
fantasy
land
run
by
puppies.
I
think
the
growth
of
the
pound
puppy
industry
influenced
me
to
write
this
tale.
The
entire
story
is
about
the
children's
adventures
in
this
new
land.
There
is
Tommy
and
there
is
Tammy--very
nasty
children
as
I
described
them.
But
the
youngest,
Mary
Ann,
is
sweet,
lovable,
kind,
and
beautiful.
(That
was
probably
suppose
to
be
me
in
the
story,
the
other
two
children
were
probably
suppose
to
represent
my
two
siblings.)
On
the
adventure,
Tommy
and
Tammy
plot
to
leave
their
sister
in
the
woods
forever
but
in
turn
get
punished
and
end
up
in
the
land
of
cats--uuuggghhh.
While
the
puppies
save
Mary
Ann
and
bring
her
safely
home,
Tommy
and
Tammy
get
left
behind
forever.
Mary
Ann
returns
home
to
her
mother
and
lives
happily
ever
after.
The
importance
of
this
story
to
my
career
as
a
writer
is
that
it
was
the
first
time
I
was
asked
to
develop
a
fairy
tale
theme--mine
was
the
good
triumph
over
the
evil.
We
were
also
asked
to
write
the
story
in
script
rather
than
print.
Also,
we
were
instructed
to
use
mostly
dialogue
and
few
general
descriptions.
All
these
restrictions
gave
me
a
focus
and
boundaries
for
the
first
time.
It
was
important
because
it
was
the
first
time
I
couldn't
just
write,
I
had
to
write
with
a
purpose.
The
final
artifact
from
my
early
childhood
collection
of
stories
I
found
was
my
first
research
report.
Also
completed
in
the
fourth
grade,
we
were
asked
to
choose
a
US
state,
research
it,
and
write
about
it.
I
chose
New
York
state.
I
found
out
square
mileage,
population,
city
names,
industries,
world
recorded
sites,
and
general
history
of
New
York.
I
found
out
some
fun
facts
like
its
state
motto,
bird,
flower,
animal
and
the
state
gem.
The
importance
of
this
paper
was
that
it
was
the
first
time
I
wrote
from
an
encyclopedia.
I
couldn't
just
write
what
I
imagined
about
New
York,
I
had
to
write
what
I
read
about
New
York.
With
this
assignment,
I
also
practiced
not
writing
straight
from
the
encyclopedia
but
putting
down
the
facts
in
a
creative
manner.
I
wrote
in
advertising
form:
On
the
New
York
Harbor
you
will
find
the
statue
of
Liberty...If
you
like
music
go
to
a
concert
in
Carnegie
Hall.
At
the
Lincoln
Center
for
the
performing
arts
you
can
see
concerts,
opera,
and
ballet.
Throughout
the
next
few
years,
I
wrote
many
research
papers.
There
was
less
emphasis
on
creative
writing
and
more
emphasis
on
studying
literature
then
writing
about
what
we
studied
or
studying
history
then
researching
a
person
we
studied
more
thoroughly
and
writing
about
his
life,
and
so
forth.
This
makes
sense
to
me
because
the
fifth
through
the
eighth
grades
are
the
general
learning
years
where
you
learn
about
everything
from
the
arts
to
the
sciences
to
history.
It
is
not
until
high
school
that
the
study
of
these
courses
gets
more
specific
and
more
intense.
The
eighth
grade
was
a
significant
year
in
my
history
as
a
writer.
It
was
at
this
age
that
I
was
awarded
the
Most
Promising
Young
Female
Writer
award.
This
award
was
given
to
one
young
female
in
every
middle
school
throughout
the
United
States
and
Canada.
Each
person
awarded
this
had
to
compete
in
a
nation
wide
writing
competition.
Needless
to
say,
I
bombed
the
competition.
The
reason
I
did
so
poorly
is
important
in
my
historical
overview
as
a
young
writer
maturing
to
a
more
developed
adult
writer.
I
bombed
the
competition
because
it
was
timed.
I
cannot
write
under
pressure.
Not
only
was
the
competition
timed
but
we
did
not
know
the
topic
ahead
of
time.
So
I
was
placed
in
a
room,
handed
an
assignment
which
I
believe
was
something
like,
tell
us
about
your
greatest
failure
and
how
it
turned
into
an
accomplishment,
and
was
told
I
had
one
hour.
WHAtff
I
exclaimed.
I
could
not
do
it.
If
you
asked
me
to
do
it
now
I
could
because
I
would
take
a
few
minutes
to
think,
make
an
outline,
and
write
as
if
I
were
telling
a
story
to
the
person
beside
me.
But
then,
I
was
so
disorganized
and
I
thought
good
writing
was
good
writing
only
if
each
sentence
was
elaborate
and
perfect.
I
tried
to
make
each
sentence
sound
so
sophisticated,
wordy,
and
challenging
to
prove
that
I
was
worthy
of
receiving
this
award.
In
turn,
I
accomplished
the
complete
opposite.
And
so
I
moved
onto
high
school.
Like
any
other
high
school
student
I
had
a
gazillion
papers
to
write
and
yet
I
cannot
even
think
of
one
to
explain
how
my
writing
developed
throughout
those
four
years.
What
I
do
remember
though
is
one
specific
class
that
made
an
impact
on
my
history
as
a
writer.
The
class
was
offered
my
senior
year
of
high
school.
It
was
taught
by
this
wonderfully
encouraging
woman
and
was
called
Advanced
Writing
and
Rhetoric.
It
was
a
course
that
taught
us
to
write
for
persuasion.
I
loved
it.
I
discovered
it
was
what
I
had
always
wanted
to
do
with
my
writing--
persuade
people.
I
wanted
to
argue
theories
and
ideas,
challenge
people
with
mine,
and
persuade
them.
We
were
assigned
an
editorial
or
opinion
piece
from
a
magazine
or
newspaper
and
asked
to
write
responses
not
summaries
to
it.
I
thought
it
was
so
much
fun.
I
would
write
an
argumentative
response
each
time
even
if
I
agreed
with
the
author
of
the
piece.
It
was
more
fun
that
way.
After
I
left
the
classroom,
I
had
a
new
love
for
writing.
I
promised
myself
I
would
enter
college
and
study
journalism.
I
now
realize
I
was
much
too
young
to
determine
the
rest
of
my
life
after
one
class.
Two
years
later,
in
college,
my
attitude
would
change.
I
would
take
a
journalism
course
and
realize
how
difficult
writing
for
a
paper
can
be
if
you
are
a
person
like
me
who
analyzes
things
and
criticizes
things.
Writing
for
a
paper
is
like
listing
straight
facts.
There
is
no
room
for
opinion
or
analysis
or
comment.
I
would
soon
learn
I
could
never
survive
as
a
journalist.
When
I
entered
college,
I
signed
up
for
an
English
course
that
was
constructed
around
literary
analysis
and
criticism.
This
course
varied
greatly
from
my
pre-assigned
English
course
called
First
Year
Writing.
Although
they
were
so
different
in
material,
focus,
and
construct,
I
learned
so
much
from
both
classes.
From
the
literary
course,
I
learned
that
good
writing
does
not
mean
fancy
writing.
I
thought
if
I
was
so
elaborate
and
detailed
that
I
would
be
considered
an
amazing
writer.
Although
most
of
my
writing
did
prove
to
be
intelligent
and
thorough,
it
was
mu(c)h
too
verbose--
which
is
actually
ironic
since
I
do
have
the
world's
smallest
vocabulary.
The
papers
I
handed
in
became
hideous
explanations
of
books
I
read
instead
of
thoughtful
insights.
Luckily,
my
professor
saw
the
smart
and
dedicated
English
student
behind
this
mess
on
the
paper
and
took
the
time
to
work
with
me
and
challenge
me.
My
papers
would
be
returned
to
me
with
slashes
through
almost
every
other
sentence.
But,
beside
each
pen
mark
would
be
a
comment
like,
Whoa--tone
it
down,
or
Allison,
this
is
too
much...I
like
passion
and
intensity
but
I
want
precision
and
specificity
too.
When
I'd
flip
to
the
last
page
I'd
see
a
big
B-.
I
never
got
anything
less
than
an
A
on
papers
I
wrote
previous
to
taking
this
class.
What
happened?
I
would
ask
myself.
His
comments
after
the
grade
were
things
like,
your
main
aim
should
be
to
make
your
point,
or
use
your
power
with
words,
not
to
prettify
that
argument,
but
to
move
it
along,
fuel
it.
He
always
encouraged
rewrites.
He
worked
with
me
through
my
immediate
disappointment
and
assured
me
I
was
a
better
writer
than
what
I
displayed.
He
assured
me
everything
was
there
except
the
discipline
and
clarity.
And
so
I
fought
thorough
my
disappointment,
sat
down,
cut
out
all
the
glitz,
and
worked
strictly
on
precision.
I
got
an
A-,
you
know.
Like
he
said,
A
rewrite
well
worth
doing.
My
first
year
writing
professor
loved
my
writing
from
the
start.
I
learned
a
lot
from
this
class
because
of
how
she
constructed
each
writing
assignment.
Although
it
was
tedious,
annoying,
and
sometimes
often
boring
at
first,
the
final
paper
was
that
much
more
satisfying,
complete,
and
wonderfully
expressed.
With
each
paper,
we
were
given
a
topic
and
told
to
write
a
draft.
Then
came
a
peer
editing
session.
Then
we
were
given
instructions
on
how
to
limit
the
paper
for
draft
number
two.
We
were
told
to
revise
and
rework
and
come
in
with
a
new
draft
consisting
of
half
the
number
of
pages
as
the
first
one
for
peer
editing
session
number
two.
Then
again,
more
limits
were
set
to
produce
more
concise
papers.
And
again,
another
peer
editing
session.
Then
came
the
final
version.
For
example,
we
were
asked
to
describe
a
place
we
called
home.
Then
our
first
limits
were
to
describe
only
one
scene
from
our
first
papers.
From
this
draft,
our
limits
were
to
use
dialogue
rather
than
concrete
images
to
describe
the
scene.
Finally,
we
were
told
to
utilize
this
scene
and
simply
switch
either
points
of
view,
tense,
or
genre
to
construct
a
paper
we
would
have
weeks
before
never
believed
imaginable.
This
experience
was
perhaps
the
most
constructive
writing
experience
of
my
career
thus
far.
I
am
now
at
a
point
in
my
career
or
history
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
where
instead
of
writing
about
a
TV
who
ran
away
from
home,
I
write
about
how
TV
changed
people's
lives
entirely.
I
will
write
about
how
the
implementation
of
the
television
set
into
mainstream
American
homes
in
the
1950s
changed
families
and
what
was
known
as
the
American
household.
In
fact,
that
paper
was
perhaps
one
of
the
most
well
constructed,
thorough
and
concise
papers
I
have
ever
written.
My
professor
thought
so
too,
except
for
a
few
passages
where
he
wrote
that
my
argument
could
have
been
more
thorough
if
my
language
had
been
more
concise.
After
reading
that
comment
and
thinking
back
on
all
my
teachers
and
professors'
comments
to
me,
I
determined
that
the
best
advice
I
ever
received
was:
tell
it
like
it
is.
Tell
it
like
a
story.
No
fancy
stuff;
it
just
clouds
your
argument
or
your
analysis.
This
advice
is
always
a
challenge
to
me
when
I
sit
down
to
write,
but
I
do
think
of
it
every
time
I
pick
up
a
pen.
