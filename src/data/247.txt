A
Continued
Look
at
Literacy
As
a
result
of
my
experiences
as
a
writer
and
as
writing
associate,
I
see
a
distinct
change
in
the
way
I
approach
and
tackle
a
writing
assignment.
Due
to
the
nature
of
the
writing
assignments
I
completed
over
this
past
year,
I
have
begun
to
see
writing
more
as
a
tool
and
means
for
exploration
rather
than
a
task.
However,
this
change
was
gradual,
and
until
I
began
preparing
this
narrative,
it
was
something
I
had
not
really
noticed
or
appreciated.
Before
my
Madness
in
Literature
course,
if
a
professor
ever
told
me
that
writing
was
a
journey
and
they
were
interested
in
my
thoughts
and
struggles
with
ideas
and
not
a
final,
mind-shattering
conclusion,
I
would
have
thought
they
were
insane.
In
fact,
when
Professor
Setton
first
said
this
to
the
class,
I
thought
she
was
nuts,
a
concept
I,
as
a
student
in
her
Madness
in
Literature
class,
was
coincidentally,
trying
to
define.
For
me,
the
idea
of
starting
to
write
a
paper
with
a
notion
to
explore,
but
no
final
destination,
seemed
a
bit
deranged
and
peculiar,
like
getting
in
a
car
with
a
full
tank
of
gas
and
driving,
with
no
preconceived
direction,
until
the
car
stops.
However,
the
four
essays
I
wrote
for
Setton,
are
among
my
most
prized
and
most
interesting.
With
her
open
assignments
and
class
readings,
Setton
challenged
me
to
investigate
human
nature,
as
well
as
myself,
and
most
importantly,
to
communicate
these
abstract
concepts
in
writing.
In
addition
to
further
altering
my
impressions
of
writing,
Setton
introduced
me
to
the
benefits
of
free
writing.
After
spending
several
nights
staring
at
a
blank
computer
screen,
struggling
to
put
my
thoughts
on
the
animal
nature
of
human
beings
into
words
and
intelligible
sentences,
I
decided
to
take
Professor
Setton's
advice
and
try
a
free
writing
exercise.
Just
before
going
to
sleep,
a
time
Setton
said
was
perfect
for
writing
because
the
mind
is
too
tired
to
hold
any
ideas
back,
I
jotted
a
couple
of
key
words
at
the
top
of
my
page,
shut
out
the
world,
and
managed
to
write
for
thirty
minutes.
The
next
day,
when
I
went
back
to
my
notes,
I
found
that
I
actually
came
up
with
several
avenues
to
investigate
and
an
introduction
for
my
paper.
Free
writing
proved
successful
in
my
brainstorming
and
overcoming
my
writers
block
numerous
times
during
that
particular
beast
of
an
assignment,
as
well
as
writing
projects
for
other
classes.
However,
my
most
crucial
writing
experience
over
this
year
came,
in
Westfall's
Renaissance
Literature
Drama
course.
I
still
remember
the
look
on
my
face
when,
a
quarter
of
the
way
through
the
semester,
Professor
Westfall
informed
the
class
that
by
the
end
of
the
term
we
would
have
a
twenty-five
page
english
research
paper
worthy
of
publication
completed.
My
initial
shock
came
from
the
words,
twenty-five
pages.
For
a
biology
major
used
to
lab
reports
and
ten
page
papers,
twenty-five
pages
seemed
like
curse
words
especially
when
followed
by
english
and
publication.
However,
what
really
confused
me
was
the
idea
of
english
research;
to
me,
the
two
words
seemed
totally
unrelated.
In
my
science
mind,
research
was
done
on
a
hypothesis,
something
that
can
be
proved
through
experimentation,
and
after
all,
there
were
no
english
labs,
were
there?
During
this
course
I
learned
to
appreciate
the
art
of
writing
in
stages
and
constant
revision.
My
paper
began
as
a
meager
annotated
bibliography,
which
for
me,
was
an
altogether
new
writing
tool,
and
slowly,
over
several
weeks
and
numerous
trips
to
Dr.
Westfall's
office,
developed
into
a
ten
page
background
study
on
jewish
stereotypes
and
history
in
England.
As
if
that
was
not
hard
enough
to
compile,
it
was
then
my
turn
to
assimilate
class
and
outside
period
readings
with
my
research
and
demonstrate,
in
written
form,
what
the
works
and
drama
of
the
period
divulged
about
my
topic,
Jewish
life
in
Renaissance
England.
It
was
during
this
stage
of
my
writing
that
I
came
up
against
my
largest
writing
challenge.
After
weeks
of
contemplation
and
lots
of
guidance
from
Dr.
Westfall,
I
finally
decided
that
the
focus
of
my
investigation
into
Jewish
life
would
be
the
religious
conversion
of
Jessica
in
The
Merchant
of
Venice
and
Abigail
in
The
Jew
of
Malta.
Satisfied
with
and
excited
about
the
originality
of
my
topic,
I
set
out
to
assemble
another
annotated
bibliography
for
the
second,
interpretive
portion
of
my
paper.
However,
to
my
dismay,
I
discovered
that
since
my
topic
divulged
from
the
normal
Shylock
and
Barabas
discussions,
there
was
virtually
no
prior
research
conducted
on
this
specific
topic.
After
wasting
hours
searching
for
articles
that
did
not
exist,
I
finally
accepted
that
the
second
half
of
my
paper
was
going
to
have
to
come
solely
from
my
own
head
and
be,
as
Dr.
Westfall
put
it,
what
Perrin
thinks
about
this
and
what
Perrin
believes
this
means.
I
soon
learned
that
english
research
is
easier
said
than
done.
It
took
several
days
for
me
to
figure
out
how
to
begin
investigating
my
topic,
and
several
more
to
finally
put
my
basic
ideas
into
words.
However,
my
real
trouble
came
with
organization;
I
could
not
figure
out
where
to
fit
in
all
of
my
seemingly
unrelated
ideas.
I
had
never
before
written
a
twenty-five
page
paper,
and
it
showed.
At
a
virtual
writing
road
block,
I
found
myself
taking
the
advice
I
often
gave
as
a
writing
associate
to
papers
with
organizational
problems;
I
cut
each
paragraph
apart
from
the
others
and
tried
to
piece
them
together
in
some
sort
of
intelligible
order.
Finally,
after
playing
around
with
my
writing
puzzle
and
realizing
this
paper
required
a
one
page
thesis
statement
rather
than
a
one
paragraph
one,
I
continued
on
my
writing
journey.
I
remember
the
utter
relief
and
sense
of
accomplishment
I
felt
as
I
stapled
my
twenty-seven
page
masterpiece
together
and
ran
to
Pardee
Hall
to
hand
it
in,
a
minute
before
the
four-o'clock
deadline.
This
paper
was,
by
far,
the
most
difficult,
frustrating,
challenging,
and
painful
writing
assignment
I
have
faced
and,
as
a
result,
writing
that
paper
was
both
a
formative
and
rewarding
experience.
Once
I
overcame
my
initial
worries
and
structural
problems,
I
could
actually
enjoy
my
journey
and
the
conclusions
I
made
along
the
way.
Successfully
completing
this
paper,
along
with
the
other
english
assignments
and
endless
laboratory
reports
changed
the
way
I
think
about
and
approach
writing.
Over
this
past
year,
my
work
as
a
writing
associate
has
also
contributed
to
the
evolution
of
my
writing
identity.
After
WA-ingM
for
a
first
year
seminar
class
and
reading
numerous
papers
with
no
thesis,
structure,
or
organization,
I
learned
to
appreciate
a
writing
tool
I
previously
disregarded,
outlining.
Although
I
always
would
scribble
a
few
ideas
down
on
paper
before
I
began
to
write,
I
never
really
made
much
of
an
outline
for
my
papers
until
I
saw,
first-hand,
how
beneficial
it
was
to
the
students
with
whom
I
was
working.
This
technique
proved
essential
to
me
when
I
set
out
to
tackle
my
own
structural
disaster
in
my
Renaissance
Literature
paper.
In
addition,
as
a
result
of
my
experience
as
a
writing
associate,
I
found
myself
turning
numerous
times
to
my
other
writing
associate
friends"
for
advice
and
recommendations
on
my
own
work.
Many
times,
certain
areas
or
terms
in
my
papers,
which
I
think
are
crystal
clear
due
to
my
familiarity
with
the
material,
often
are
unintelligible
to
another,
less
informed
reader.
My
friends
have
always
been
extremely
helpful
in
pointing
out
these
areas
to
me
and
providing
me
with
guidelines
for
the
expansion
and
evolution
of
my
ideas.
