An
expert?
I
think
not.
I'm
only
a
student
who
others
think
has
a
descent
handle
on
the
writing
process
and
what
goes
along
with
it.
Yet
in
my
two
semesters
as
a
WA,
I
have
seen
that
different
people
have
varying
ideas
as
to
what
a
WA
is
and
what
one
does.
This
is
not
only
among
students
who
have
to
go
to
Writing
Associates,
but
also
among
professors
who
use
WAs
(voluntarily
or
otherwise),
and
probably
WAs
themselves.
In
this
past
year
I
have
experienced
the
different
views
about
WAs,
done
some
writing
of
my
own,
and
drawn
conclusions
about
what
WAing
has
meant
to
me.
I
believe
that
differing
views
on
WAs
confuse
many
who
are
involved
and
make
the
experience
more
painful
for
everyone.
In
the
fall
semester,
I
had
a
FYS
class
with
a
"new"
professor,
one
who
had
never
used
a
WA
before.
In
his
own
words,
he
"wouldn't
use
one
unless
forced
to."
On
top
of
that
statement
to
me,
he
scared
the
beejeebers
of
out
the
class
to
the
point
where
one
student
in
the
first
round
of
meetings
looked
at
me
with
an
astounded
expression
on
his
face
and
said,
"You're
not
the
she-devil,
Professor--------
said
you
were."
Hello!
Wake
up
call
for
me.
Time
to
go
have
another
little
chat
with
the
professor
and
try
to
explain
what,
in
my
view,
a
WAs
job
is.
I'm
not
here
to
grade
papers
or
tell
students
what
their
grade
might
be.
I'm
here
to
offer
advice
for,
conversation
about,
and
another
pair
of
eyes
to
look
at
the
paper.
Yes,
I
will
make
suggestions
based
on
what
I
know
about
writing,
what
I've
been
told
about
the
assignment
by
you
(and
the
student),
and
what
just
plain
sounds
right.
I'm
here
as
a
friendly
(I
hope)
face
for
students
to
ask
questions,
to
sounds
concerns,
or
just
to
talk
with.
I
am
a
friend,
not
a
foe
-
tell
them
this.
And
realize
that
I'm
not
going
to
go
over
every
little
detail.
IT'S
NOT
MY
JOB!
We
have
HOC's
and
LOC's,
and
every
little
grammar
point
cannot
possibly
be
covered
in
one
meeting.
My
top
priorities
are
the
thesis,
structure,
clarity,
and
flow,
not
punctuation
and
grammar
unless
it
has
reached
such
a
point
that
it
detracts
from
everything
good
in
the
paper.
This
experience
showed
me
that
not
everyone
has
the
same
feelings
about
the
program,
or
the
same
expectations.
Why?
I
cannot
say.
But
I
can
say
that
this
wasn't
the
only
case.
In
the
spring
semester,
I
had
a
VaST
professor
who
pretty
much
made
it
clear
the
WAs
for
his
sections
of
this
class
were
not
going
to
be
of
much
use.
I
spent
four
weeks
sending
emails,
writing
notes
that
I
slipped
under
his
door,
hanging
around
outside
his
office,
making
phone
calls
-
and
got
no
response.
Until,
that
is,
the
day
before
the
first
assignment
was
to
be
turned
in
when
I
just
happened
to
pass
him
in
Farinon
at
lunch.
I
held
that
one
set
of
meetings
where
all
I
could
really
go
over
on
each
paper
was
to
make
sure
it
had
a
focus.
This
was
not
due
to
a
lack
of
preparation,
but
to
the
fact
that
the
professor
did
not
clearly
state
what
the
assignment
was.
The
verbal
assignment
was
quite
vague,
and
all
the
professor
wanted
was
a
topic
and
some
sort
of
support,
either
factual
or
personal
beliefs.
Ultimately,
I
don't
believe
the
professor
knew
what
he
wanted.
We
were
just
to
go
over
the
papers
to
ensure
that
the
papers
had
some
sort
of
focus,
no
matter
how
vague,
on
what
they
were
discussing
in
class.
Into
the
semester,
I
was
asked
to
turn
in
another
meeting
schedule.
On
the
day
the
papers
were
due,
there
were
no
papers.
He
had
delayed
the
due
date
but
"forgotten"
to
tell
me.
I
hurry,
scramble,
and
rearrange
my
schedule.
Hey,
I'm
good.
I
did
this.
Then
only
two
of
eleven
students
showed
up
to
meetings.
Why?
I
believe
it
was
because
Professor
--
said
I
wasn't
going
to
be
that
much
help
to
them
and
he
didn't
enforce
coming
to
meetings
in
any
way.
Okay.
Fine.
I
had
told
him
that
I
couldn't
reschedule
any
appointments
due
to
his
lack
of
telling
me
about
the
change
in
advance
and
my
own
school
schedule.
He
said
fine,
just
to
tell
him
who
didn't
show.
I
don't
mind
in
a
way
(less
work
and
stress),
but
it
was
also
an
insult
to
me
and
what
I
try
to
accomplish
every
meeting.
I
got
paid
however
much
money
this
semester
for
going
to
weekly
staff
meetings,
working
drop
in,
an
hour
and
a
half
of
interviewing,
and
probably
twenty
hours
of
reading
and
meetings
for
the
class.
That
comes
to
something
like
twenty-five
dollars
an
hour.
Not
bad
in
my
eyes.
But
like
any
other
human
being,
I
still
desire
to
be
treated
with
respect.
Now
I
realize
that
this
is
not
always
the
case.
Fall
semester,
I
had
four
rounds
of
meetings,
each
having
seventeen
eight-page
papers.
Talk
about
time.
And
I
realize
that
not
every
aspect
about
WAing
is
bad.
I
wouldn't
have
returned
(even
for
money)
if
that
were
the
case.
I
can
say
the
friends
I
made,
both
other
WA's,
students
from
the
classes,
and
drop-ins,
made
it
worth
it.
First
semester,
of
the
seventeen
students,
four
were
in
my
dorm,
two
on
my
floor.
Two
or
three
of
them
seemed
to
appreciate
the
pointers
and
would
appear
in
my
doorway
to
drop
off
their
paper
for
another
look
over
-
one
even
for
another
class.
But
anyway,
I
seemed
to
start
my
own
little
drop
in
service.
One
girls'
roommate
came
by
the
next
semester
with
a
paper
she
was
having
trouble
with.
We
sat
down
and
hashed
it
out,
and
became
friends
in
the
process.
And
then
there
was
the
love
I
felt
during
drop
in
hours
(please
note
the
sarcasm).
I
was
the
lucky
WA
who
always
got
swamped.
Whoever
told
me
to
bring
work
with
me
because
no
one
ever
came
played
one
nasty
joke
on
me.
The
first
three
times
I
actually
got
people,
two
or
three
in
a
two-hour
block.
The
whopper
was
the
end
of
the
spring
semester:
three
and
a
half
hours
later
I
had
read
and
talked
about
two
VaST
papers,
a
forty
page
senior
honors
thesis,
and
three
papers
on
international
politics.
Talk
about
what
regulating
drop
in
hours
can
do
for
you!
And
then
there
was
the
interviewing
process.
Having
been
interviewed
twice
for
this
job,
I
know
what
it
is
like
to
be
on
the
receiving
end
of
the
process,
but
it
was
a
new
look
from
the
other
side.
This
was
especially
true
when
one
applicant
gave
a
frank
view
of
what
her
WA
had
commented
on
about
her
papers
versus
what
we
had
just
told
her
a
WA
is
supposed
to
do.
The
drastic
difference
in
emphasis
on
grammar
came
into
discussion.
Frankly,
I've
done
this
myself.
I
think
that
sometimes
with
good
papers,
we
(WAs)
feel
the
need
to
correct
something,
so
grammar
comes
into
focus.
On
the
whole,
we
probably
feel
quite
comfortable
with
our
understanding
of
grammar
and
our
ability
to
"fix
it,"
so
we
stress
what
is
concrete
and
known
to
us.
On
"good"
papers,
we
still
feel
obligated
to
help
in
some
way,
so
this
is
often
it
(as
it
seems).
Thesis
statements
and
organization
can
be
more
complicated
and
therefore
more
challenging
and
time
consuming,
as
well
as
more
difficult
to
impress
the
need
upon
the
writer,
to
improve
upon.
Grammar
may
be
a
part
of
a
paper
where
we
know
for
sure
what
we
are
doing.
Or,
we
like
the
thesis
and
don't
want
to
touch
it,
but
can't
find
much
else
to
comment
on
because
we
don't
look
hard
enough.
Being
a
WA
has
been
an
interesting
experience
for
me,
especially
this
academic
year.
I
say
interesting
because
I
didn't
have
much
assigned
writing
for
my
own
classes,
only
two
papers
first
semester
and
one
project
summary
at
the
end
of
the
year.
Yes,
I
wrote
a
two
page
list
of
what
I
learned
in
my
lab
the
first
semester,
but
almost
anyone
can
bullet
about
twenty
things
they
did
in
the
course
of
fourteen
weeks
simply
by
going
back
through
all
of
their
labs.
I
did
the
most
writing
for
my
Intro
to
Government
class
and
that
was
an
experience
of
its
own.
The
first
paper
was
on
my
take
of
Candidate
Bush.
Due
to
what
my
roommate
calls
my
"diligently
overboard
nature,"
I
had
filled
a
two
inch
notebook
with
the
information
I
had
on
Candidate
Bush's
views,
Cheney's
views,
the
Republican
Party's
views,
Gore's
views...
You
get
the
idea.
I
had
to
discuss
"my"
general
views
on
"my"
key
issues
and
the
questions
asked
by
the
"reporters"
and
"my"
responses
to
them.
I
found
myself
trying
to
put
all
this
information
into
a
three-page
report.
First
I
got
rid
of
the
double
spacing.
Then
the
font
was
downsized.
Finally
margins
were
made
smaller.
And
still
not
enough
room!
What
now?
Then
my
roommate
tells
me
to
WA
my
own
paper.
Thesis?
Check.
Did
you
stick
to
the
thesis?
No.
Clarity
and
organization?
Not
really.
Problems...
So
I
attacked,
more
veraciously
than
I
would
someone
else's
paper,
but
attacked
none
the
less.
In
the
process,
I
learned
how
hard
it
can
be
to
write
a
paper
of
a
defined
length
when
you
knew
nothing
on
the
topic
to
begin
with.
I
knew
so
little
on
the
views
and
issues
that
the
campaign
revolved
around,
that
I
simply
went
out
to
find
information.
Then
I
ended
up
with
too
much
information
and
none
of
it
in
any
clear
organizational
form
in
my
big,
fat
binder.
I
didn't
know
what
to
do
with
it
all,
so
I
tried
to
put
it
all
in,
in
any
way
I
could.
In
the
end
(after
a
lot
of
sorting,
cutting,
rewriting,
editing
and
tossing)
I
ended
up
with
a
paper
that
was
size
12
font,
three
pages,
and
only
1.5
spaced.
I
can
honestly
say
I
struggled
with
this,
but
I
know
what
writers
go
through
at
times.
Why
had
it
never
happened
to
me
before?
Maybe
it
had
but
I
just
didn't
recognize
it.
Maybe
because
I
usually
use
an
outline
to
write
from
and
note
cards
to
do
research
with.
Maybe
because
my
eleventh
grade
teacher
liked
that
random
style
of
writing.
Whatever...
Because
it
happened,
I
got
a
firsthand
understanding
of
what
this
is
like
at
a
time
when
I
could
appreciate
it.
The
second
paper
for
the
class
went
better,
but
the
professor
advised
that
I
should
go
longer
instead
of
using
smaller
spacing.
The
only
other
"real"
writing
was
for
my
Junior
Project
write-up,
and
it
was
a
partner
deal.
Having
never
written
anything
besides
short
lab
reports
with
another
person,
much
less
such
an
important
paper
as
this,
it
was
an
experience
in
itself.
As
the
professor
said
in
the
end,
you
could
clearly
tell
who
wrote
what
passages
in
the
paper.
I
felt
very
self-conscious
when
I
corrected
or
wanted
to
improve
something
he
had
written.
WAing
a
good
friend
and
colleague
(though
he
wasn't
a
WA)
is
difficult.
To
be
honest,
I
only
did
part
of
what
I
probably
could
or
should
have
done.
I
didn't
want
to
seem
the
hard-ass
and
didn't
want
the
professor
to
think
that
I
had
done
all
of
the
writing,
but
in
the
end
the
paper
sounded
funny
in
certain
spots.
The
content
was
solid,
but
our
writing
styles
clashed.
I
am
a
more
formal
writer
than
he
is.
He
uses
a
more
casual
vocabulary.
I
am
conscious
of
the
flow
of
the
paper
as
I
write,
whereas
he
likes
to
go
back
later
after
he
simply
has
ideas
down
in
any
form
(fragments,
run-ons,
outlines...).
This
probably
happens
frequently
when
writing
group
reports,
and
I
know
from
staff
meetings
last
semester
that
it
did
cause
problems
in
one
particular
VaST
course,
both
from
the
perspective
of
the
WA
and
a
WA
who
was
in
the
class.
I'm
not
sure
how
one
could
deal
with
it
fully.
Different
writing
styles
and
outlooks
on
writing
can
not
be
changed
with
just
a
snap
of
the
fingers.
Styles
will
differ
and
clash,
and
that
is
what
makes
reading
so
much
fun.
Different
poets
and
writers
vary
so
much
that
you
can
like
one
while
hating
another
-
even
if
they
write
on
the
same
topic.
Let
me
just
say
that
it
was
another
learning
experience
that
may
have
had
more
of
an
impact
on
me
due
to
this
job.
Besides
writing
for
myself,
I
had
only
these
assignments
and
it
felt
awkward
at
times
to
be
saying
'you
might
want
to
do
this
or
that'
when
I
wasn't
actively
doing
it
myself.
But
at
the
same
time,
WAing
kept
me
in
touch
with
my
writing.
It
kept
me
thinking
about
what
I
was
doing
and
should
be
doing.
While
I
managed
to
do
some
free
writing
of
my
own,
it
was
odd
not
to
have
so
much
assigned
writing.
I
missed
it
in
many
ways.
From
ninth
grade
on,
I
usually
had
a
writing
assignment
at
least
every
other
week
(big
or
small)
from
my
English
teachers,
not
to
mention
other
courses.
The
transition
to
college
was
shock
in
that
I
wasn't
writing
as
much,
but
I
dealt
with
it.
I
knew
going
into
engineering
that
I
would
not
be
doing
as
much
"reading
and
writing"
in
the
typical
sense
as
I
had
before.
But
it
wasn't
until
this
year
that
I
really
stopped.
I
still
read
cartons
of
books
-thanks
in
part
to
my
mom,
the
librarian.
And
that
is
the
best
advice
I
can
give
anyone.
Keep
reading
and
writing,
anyway
you
can.
It
will
keep
the
basic
ideas
in
your
mind.
Don't
become
discouraged
by
anything
you
face.
You
will
encounter
students
and
professors
who
don't
really
want
to
meet
with
you.
You
still
have
to
do
your
job
and
give
it
your
best
shot
to
impart
something
to
them
that
will
help.
Become
a
nuisance
to
the
professor
if
he
or
she
isn't
helping
you
enough.
Treat
all
students
with
the
respect
you
would
want,
no
matter
the
state
of
what
they
bring
you
or
how
they
act.
Remember
that
this
is
a
job,
but
also
a
learning
experience.
Enjoy
it,
make
friends,
and
don't
let
it
run
your
life.
