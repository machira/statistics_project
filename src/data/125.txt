Literacy
Narrative
for
Workshop
A
Look
At
Literacy
I
remember
hearing
the
thrilling
slap
of
the
bumble-bee
magnet
as
my
mom
carefully
placed
my
masterpiece
on
the
door
of
the
kitchen
refrigerator.
I
had
been
working
for
hours,
drawing
and
coloring
my
own
family
portrait.
With
my
mother's
hand
wrapped
tightly
around
mine,
we
wrote
my
story
on
the
bottom
of
the
drawing
in
dark
green
crayon.
Finishing
off
my
masterpiece,
I
brilliantly
signed
my
name,
perhaps
with
more
a
less
traditional
E,
a
backwards
letter
here
and
there,
but
most
importantly,
all
by
myself.
The
excitement
and
pride
that
I
felt
as
I
viewed
my
picture
in
its
special
spot
on
refridgerator
and
the
praise
I
received
from
my
father
when
he
returned
from
work,
inspired
me
to
create
dozens
more
drawings,
paintings,
and
stories
as
I
grew
older.
After
years
of
singing
the
alphabet
song
with
my
parents
and
the
crew
from
Sesame
Street,
I
was
off
to
kindergarten
where
I
came
to
the
harsh
realization
that
L-M-N-O
was
really
four
different
letters.
From
a
"large"
desk
in
the
center
of
the
classroom,
I
sat
with
an
oversized
pencil
in
my
hand
looking
from
the
meticulously
printed
letters
on
the
chalkboard
to
my
own
piece
of
green
writing
paper.
Staring
down
at
my
page,
I
carefully
printed
each
letter
of
the
alphabet
in
between
the
huge
one
inch
lines,
making
sure
that
all
of
my
lowercase
letters
just
touched
the
middle
dashes.
On
the
bottom
line
I
wrote
my
very
first
sentences,
My
name
is
Perrin.
I
am
6
years
old.
I
am
in
Mrs.
Guest's
class.
Of
course,
this
masterpiece
also
made
its
way
to
the
refrigerator.
After
two
years
of
penmanship
practice
and
spelling
books,
I
was
ready
for
third
grade,
and
book
reports.
At
my
kitchen
table,
armed
with
a
notebook
and
a
pencil,
my
mother
and
I
looked
through
by
book,
a
biography
on
the
tennis
player,
Chris
Evert.
Although
I
did
not
realize
it
until
I
began
to
write
this
narrative,
this
little
book
report
taught
me
the
basic
process
of
writing.
I
first
found
the
important
information
on
her
life
that
I
wanted
in
my
report
and
struggled
through
writing
my
rough
draft.
Several
hours
later,
the
table
was
full
of
eraser
bits,
but
I
was
finished
with
my
final
report.
During
class
the
next
day,
we
dressed
as
our
famous
people
and
presented
our
reports.
After
school,
my
mother
took
a
picture
of
me
to
commemorate
the
day,
a
heavy
tennis
racquet
in
one
hand
and
my
very
first
school
report
in
the
other.
During
my
last
years
in
elementary
school,
there
were
many
more
book
reports
to
be
done,
as
well
as,
science
and
social
studies
papers.
Nevertheless,
my
final
and
most
memorable
elementary
school
writing
task
was
to
write
the
one
of
the
closing
speeches
for
my
sixth
grade
graduation.
I
spent
several
weekends
at
the
kitchen
table
with
my
dad
as
we
worked
to
perfect
my
speech.
I
was
thrilled
when
I
was
chosen
to
speak
and
very
excited
to
write
my
very
own
speech.
After
graduation
I
received
countless
congratulations
from
friends,
classmates,
and
family,
but
by
far
the
most
memorable
praise
was
my
parents'
tears.
However,
my
growth
as
a
writer
did
not
stop
there;
in
middle
school
I
was
introduced
to
numerous
writing
forms
including
an
exercise
known
as
freewriting.
Every
Friday,
my
seventh
grade
English
teacher
set
aside
twenty
minutes
for
us
to
write
in
our
journals.
In
these
entries
we
wrote
down
what
ever
came
to
our
minds,
things
we
were
working
on,
bothering
us,
or
weekend
plans.
At
first,
these
Friday
writings
were
tedious,
I
found
it
difficult
to
write
anything
down;
I
would
sit,
pen
in
hand,
and
try
think
of
something
interesting
or
important
to
write.
Eventually
I
realized
that
the
writing
itself,
rather
than
a
brilliant
revelation,
was
the
goal
of
this
project
and
freewriting
became
a
powerful
tool.
Over
the
years
I
have
used
freewritings
outside
of
the
classroom
for
a
multitude
of
purposes,
from
deciding
on
or
developing
the
idea
for
a
paper
to
battling
my
emotions.
My
experiences
with
freewriting
later
inspired
me
to
keep
a
journal.
Each
night,
I
would
sit
at
my
desk
with
a
flashy
pen
full
of
brightly
colored
ink
and
write
down
the
day's
happenings,
arguments
with
my
brother
and
sister,
and
whom
the
love
of
my
life
was
that
week.
I
found
that
keeping
a
journal
helped
ease
many
of
my
adolescent
frustrations,
as
well
as,
served
as
great
reading
entertainment
years
later!
Another
goal
of
our
middle
school
writing
program
was
to
develop
our
writing
skills.
Each
writing
assignment
entailed
writing
about
our
own
personal
experiences
and
each
sequential
paper
focused
upon
a
different
writing
skill:
description,
strong
verbs,
use
of
vocabulary
words,
strong
beginning,
and
strong
ending.
After
I
was
finished
with
these
papers,
I
would
run
downstairs
to
my
editors
(mom
and
dad)
and
listen
to
their
suggestions.
Although
the
changes
they
made
were
almost
always
minor,
my
mother,
who
knew
my
writing
abilities
almost
too
well,
would
occasionally
give
me
the
look
that
meant,
Perrin,
I
know
you
can
do
better
than
this,
go
back
upstairs
and
rewrite
this
paper!
Though
I
would
probably
not
have
admitted
it,
I
always
agreed
with
her.
I
gained
a
great
deal
from
sharing
my
work
with
my
mother,
she
has
instilled
in
me
the
desire
to
always
do
my
best
and
offer
nothing
less.
Throughout
middle
school
I
also
experimented
with
different
types
of
writing;
our
assignments
included
poems,
short
stories,
research-type
papers,
plays,
and
writing
and
illustrating
our
own
children's
book.
In
addition,
during
each
year
of
high
school
I
was
introduced
to
different
genres
of
writing.
Generally,
I
would
read
a
piece
of
literature
from
a
certain
genre,
then
mimic
that
type
of
writing
with
a
work
of
my
own,
as
when
my
class
read
Julius
Caesar
and
a
portion
of
Patrick
Henry's
speech
and
was
confronted
with
the
task
of
writing
a
persuasive
argument
speech.
I
also
recall
learning
about
how
authors
can
manipulate
their
readers
to
feel
certain
emotions
by
paying
careful
attention
to
their
syntax
and
diction.
Along
with
the
reading
of
numerous
works
including
Edgar
Allan
Poe's
The
Raven,
I
wrote
a
short
story
about
a
girl
who
had
lost
her
best
friend
intending
to
make
my
audience
experience
the
feelings
of
sadness
and
loneliness.
Our
papers
were
shared
with
the
class
and,
as
a
class,
we
tried
to
guess
the
emotion
each
student
was
attempting
to
achieve
in
her
readers.
I
remember
astonishing
and,
unfortunately,
depressing
not
only
my
friends,
but
my
teacher
and
other
classmates.
After
sharing
my
work,
and
listening
to
the
papers
of
my
classmates,
I
realized
the
power
of
language
and
writing.
When
the
paper
was
returned
to
me,
I
looked
beyond
the
my
favorable
letter
grade
written
in
dark
red
pen
and
found
Mrs.
Cornish's
notes
telling
me
to
Save
this!
For
the
rest
of
day
you
could
not
remove
the
smile
from
my
face.
Over
the
years,
that
was
one
of
the
most
rewarding
comments
I
ever
received.
However,
little
did
I
know
that
my
biggest
and
most
gruesome
writing
assignment
was
yet
to
come.
I
remember
sitting
at
my
desk
in
the
very
left
comer
of
room
(I
was
blessed
with
a
name
at
the
end
of
the
alphabet),
gazing
out
the
window
on
the
first
day
of
English
class,
and
hearing
my
teacher
utter
those
life
shattering
words,
research
paper.
While
I
sat
there
feeling
as
if
I
would
be
junior
forever,
he
actually
seemed
quite
pleased
about
the
assignment.
My
personal
writing
hell
began
in
late
November
with
deciding
and
researching
a
topic.
After
weeks
of
preparation
and
in-class
training
and
explanation,
I
finally
began
writing
my
first
draft;
I
found
that
all
of
the
tedious
note-taking,
pre-writing
organization
and
outlining
truly
paid
off.
When
I
sat
down
to
write,
this
time
at
my
computer,
my
paper
seemed
to
write
itself!
Thankfully,
my
teacher
seemed
to
think
I
did
as
great
a
job
of
researching
and
presenting
the
idea
of
mandatory
school
prayer
as
I
did,
though
my
grammar
needed
a
little
help.
And
remarkably
after
this
writing
experience,
hearing
research
paper
escape
from
my
very
demanding
A.P.
English
teacher's
mouth,
somehow
did
not
stop
my
heart
as
a
high
school
senior.
However,
throughout
high
school
I
found
that
English
was
not
the
only
subject
that
entailed
writing.
Both
my
history
and
science
classes
required
me
to
further
develop,
fine-tune,
and
even
specialize
my
writing
skills.
Trying
to
expand
my
writing
ability
to
adjust
and
differentiate
between
writing
a
flowery,
descriptive
English
paper,
a
factual
history
paper,
and
a
lab
report
or
other
science
related
paper
was
perhaps
the
toughest
lesson
for
me
to
learn.
At
first,
adapting
my
writing
style
was
very
difficult,
especially
in
my
science
classes.
To
a
student
who
generally
wrote
A
English
papers,
receiving
a
C
on
my
first
biology
lab
report
was
both
shocking
and
devastating.
But,
the
C
certainly
proved
to
me
that
scientific
writing
was
something
I
was
going
to
need
to
practice
and
gave
me
incentive
to
work
even
harder
next
time.
By
the
time
I
was
a
senior,
the
thought
of
biology
lab
reports
and
a
chemistry
reaction
paper
did
not
cause
the
butterflies
to
take
flight
in
my
stomach.
After
all
my
high
school
English
classes,
especially
the
A.P
English
class
I
took
as
a
senior,
I
felt
adequately
prepared
for
the
challenges
of
college
writing.
On
the
first
day
of
school
my
A.P.
English
teacher
announced
that
this
was
a
college
level
course
and
all
work
would
be
graded
on
such
a
scale.
Throughout
the
year
we
were
challenged
with
numerous
writing
assignments,
including
analytical,
interpretive,
and
research
papers,
that
necessitated
applying
all
of
the
writing
skills
we
learned
in
previous
classes
to
a
different
way
of
writing.
As
a
result,
when
my
college
first
year
seminar
proffesor
assigned
a
two
page
analytical
essay
in
the
first
weeks
of
school,
I
was
not
immediately
alarmed.
However,
when
I
finally
sat
down
to
write
my
first
essay
I
stared
at
my
blank
computer
screen
for
almost
an
hour.
Finally,
after
hours
of
brooding
over
each
line
of
text
and
completely
stressing
myself
our,
I
finished
my
first
college
essay.
Although
my
professor
made
numerous
suggestions
and
comments
on
my
paper,
it
was
nothing
compared
to
the
road
maps
drawn
in
response
to
some
students'
papers.
After
this
first
essay
I
realized
how
wonderfully
my
middle
and
high
school
teachers
prepared
me
for
the
expectations
of
college
writing.
My
final
FYS
project
was
to
write
my
own
chitaqua,
life
journey,
modeled
after
the
book
by
Pirsig
we
read
during
the
semester,
Zen
and
the
Art
of
Motorcycle
Maintenance.
The
professor
noted
that
choosing
this
paper
for
a
final
piece
in
your
FYS
portfolio
was
a
highest
risk-highest
reward
option.
I
remember
struggling
for
days
just
trying
to
come
up
with
a
topic
and
vehicle
through
which
I
would
explain
my
thoughts
on
the
topic
of
my
seminar,
high
and
popular
culture.
After
choosing
the
art
of
photography
as
my
vehicle,
I
spent
the
next
week
laboring
over
the
most
difficult
and
challenging
assignment
I
ever
faced.
As
I
was
writing
this
paper,
I
saw
finishing
a
paragraph
as
a
major
accomplishment.
Eventually,
after
spending
days
in
my
room,
coming
out
only
for
the
occasional
15
minute
meal,
I
completed
my
rough
draft.
Racing
down
the
hall,
the
night
before
the
paper
was
due,
I
proudly
exchanged
papers
with
my
friend,
classmate,
and
peer
editor.
After
what
seemed
like
the
most
wonderful
night's
sleep
I
ever
experienced,
I
worked
all
day
making
my
final
changes
and
compiling
my
portfolio.
A
desperate
ten
minutes
before
the
assignment
was
due,
I
shoved
my
folder
under
my
jacket
and
took
off
in
a
mad
sprint
through
the
pouring
rain
to
hand
in
my
chitaqua.
The
pride
I
felt
as
I
was
reading
over
my
paper
that
night
made
writing
this
serious,
challenging
paper
my
best
experience
as
a
writer.
I
know
that
after
writing
that
paper,
I
can
handle
any
assignment.
Packed
away
in
my
closet
are
all
of
the
papers,
reports,
and
projects
I
did
throughout
school.
Every
year,
when
I
put
away
the
new
papers,
I
take
a
couple
minutes
to
glance
at
my
old
assignments.
Looking
from
papers
with
faded
construction
paper
covers
to
those
with
fancy
title
pages
from
my
first
year
in
college,
I
see
just
how
far
I
have
come
as
a
writer
and
just
how
far
I
have
yet
to
go.
