Writing
Assignment:
Writing
Like
aWA
Last
year
at
this
time,
I
was
asked
to
recollect
the
events
in
my
life
that
shaped
me
into
the
writer
I
am
today.
As
I
looked
back,
images
of
incidents
that
had
been
long
ago
forgotten
started
to
form
a
story
that
chronicled
not
just
my
academic
development,
but
my
personal
development
as
well.
I
remembered
the
trials
and
tribulations
of
first
grade
when
my
teacher
told
my
dismayed
class
to
come
a
one-paragraph
description
of
oui;
patron
saints.
Next,
I
recalled
my
beloved
diary
in
fifth
grade
where
for
the
first
time
I
used
the
written
word
to
express
thoughts
and
feeling
that
I
could
not
say
aloud
to
another
soul.
I
then
moved
on
to
high
school
where
I
thought
I
had
finally
mastered
research
papers,
only
to
get
them
back
filled
with
red-inked
criticisms.
First
Year
Seminar
and
other
college
writing
course
further
engrained
in
me
that
I
would
never
be
a
perfect
writer.
Yet,
they
also
taught
me
that
I
should
strive
to
make
each
piece
of
writing
better
than
the
preceding
one
and
that
I
must
realize
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
final
draft,
for
every
essay
possesses
room
for
improvement.
Outlining
my
literary
narrative
forced
me
to
reach
some
interesting
conclusions
about
myself
and
my
writing,
and
it
also
gave
me
invaluable
advice
on
how
to
be
an
effective
Writing
Associate.
As
I
depicted
the
steps
involved
in
my
ceaseless
evolution
as
a
writer,
my
narrative
began
to
conjure
up
sentiments
that
I
had
long
since
forgotten
as
assignments
came
and
went.
I
remembered
how
each
new,
diverse,
and
challenging
writing
form
brought
with
it
intimidation
and
confusion.
Not
until
countless
revisions
and
much
hard
work
did
my
irritation
with
writing
culminate
into
excitement
over
the
finished
product.
With
a
firmer
grasp
of
my
own
frequent
perplexity
over
writing,
I
felt
better
equipped
to
relate
to
and
learn
from
other
writers.
Understanding
that
an
effective
writing
associate
should
recognize
other
writers'
differing
backgrounds
and
should
also
adapt
to
these
students'
specific
needs,
I
considered
myself
ready
to
tackle
the
tasks
involved
in
helping
the
First
Year
Seminar
writers
I
was
hired
to
assist.
My
initial
round
of
conferences
went
off
to
a
great
start.
The
first
student
I
had
an
appointment
with
came
to
the
meeting
eager
for
help.
After
he
read
my
comments
oji
his
paper,
we
engaged
in
a
lengthy
conversation
about
ways
to
revise
his
work.
Already
realizing
the
difficulty
of
college-level
writing,
he
informed
me
that
he
was
open
to
any
suggestions
that
would
help
do
better
in
the
class.
While
his
paper
was
not
the
best
essay
in
the
class,
his
work
showed
vast
potential.
As
I
read
his
work,
I
could
tell
how
thoroughly
he
researched
his
topic
and
how
painstakingly
he
worked
on
his
grammar
and
sentence
structure.
Although
he
effectively
executed
these
components
of
his
essay,
his
lack
of
organization
was
what
kept
him
from
achieving
the
excellence
he
desired
in
the
course.
His
paper
contained
some
extraordinary
ideas
and
some
remarkable
conclusions
yet
they
were
not
weaved
together
coherently;
he
was
depositing
his
valid
argument
into
a
web
of
confusion.
I
started
to
ask
him
questions
about
exactly
what
he
wanted
to
convey
to
his
intended
audience.
While
he
was
explaining
them
to
me,
I
told
him
to
write
down
these
thoughts.
From
these
jotting,
we
then
constructed
an
outline,
so
he
could
use
this
framework
to
refer
to
as
he
re-organized
his
piece.
At
our
next
conference
later
on
in
the
semester,
he
informed
me
that
this
skeleton
of
his
ideas
helped
him
enormously
by
prompting
him
to
visualize
where
he
should
place
the
contents
of
his
work.
The
success
of
the
first
meeting
left
me
with
the
false
impression
that
every
student
would
be
as
receptive
and
motivated
as
that
student
was.
Although
realistically
I
knew
that
would
not
be
the
case,
it
was
fun
to
imagine
that
all
my
other
conferences
would
run
as
smoothly.
However,
my
second
conference
that
very
same
night
woke
me
up
from
my
daydreams.
As
the
time
ticked
by,
I
waited
and
waited
for
a
no-show.
Later
that
night,
I
called
the
student
to
remind
him
that
he
scheduled
a
meeting
with
me
earlier
that
evening.
Apparently
annoyed
at
the
inconvenient
timing
of
my
phone
call,
he
did
not
sound
entirely
enthusiastic
about
figuring
out
another
date
and
time
to
meet.
After
thinking
about
it
for
several
seconds,
he
decided
that
maybe
he
would
meet
with
me
later
in
the
week.
Before
our
second
scheduled
appointment,
I
decided
to
talk
with
the
student's
professor
to
see
how
he
was
performing
in
her
class.
She
informed
me
that
he
rarely
handed
in
assignments
and
even
less
frequently
attended
class.
She
also
told
me
that
she
believed
he
was
having
an
extremely
tough
time
adjusting
to
Lafayette's
academic
environment.
With
both
anticipation
and
apprehension,
I
sat
and
waited
in
Pardee
for
the
FYS
writer.
Since
I
had
a
few
extra
minutes
before
he
was
supposed
to
arrive,
I
looked
over
his
paper
one
more
time.
I
did
not
make
many
notes
on
his
work
since
the
essay
was
indecipherably
scribbled
onto
loose-leaf
paper;
therefore,
I
was
relying
on
him
to
describe
his
paper
to
me
in
person.
When
he
finally
arrived,
I
could
visibly
tell
he
did
not
want
to
be
at
this
WA
conference.
After
we
introduced
ourselves,
I
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
his
paper.
He
told
me
honestly
that
he
did
not
spend
much
time
on
it.
When
I
asked
him
why,
he
said
that
writing
was
not
his
thing.
An
engineering
major,
he
did
not
enjoy
suffering
through
a
writing
course.
Believing
from
the
start
that
this
class
would
be
pointless
to
his
future,
he
was
not
willing
to
exert
any
effort
to
improve
his
writing.
I
informed
him
that
in
today's
working
world
an
individual
who
writes
clearly
and
effectively
stood
above
the
crowd.
He
was
not
impressed
with
my
argument,
so
I
decided
we
should
start
reviewing
his
paper.
After
he
told
me
of
his
problems
with
writing,
I
decided
that
I
would
try
to
be
as
enthusiastic
as
possible
about
the
good
points
of
his
work
in
order
to
build
up
his
confidence
and
to
provide
him
with
some
hope.
I
explained
to
him
that
from
what
I
could
decipher
he
understood
grammatical
rules
and
he
even
formulated
an
acceptable
thesis.
He
could
salvage
his
paper
by
doing
slightly
more
research
to
support
his
argument.
As
the
conference
went
on,
he
eased
up
a
little
bit
and
actually
began
to
talk
to
me
about
his
paper.
We
spent
most
of
the
conference
discussing
possible
ways
he
could
expand
on
his
topic.
While
he
did
not
proclaim
that
he
loved
writing
after
our
conference,
I
was
pleased
that
he
seemed
to
realize
his
writing
capability.
My
conference
with
the
best
writer
in
the
class
was
both
my
longest
and
most
productive
meeting.
When
I
first
read
this
particular
student's
paper
I
was
very
impressed
with
her
style,
organization,
grammar,
and
argument.
Since
she
was
clearly
the
strongest
writer
in
the
class,
I
assumed
that
she
would
probably
not
look
forward
to
receiving
advice
about
the
revision
of
her
paper.
I
was
wrong.
Although
this
writer
obviously
put
much
time
and
effort
into
her
draft,
she
was
still
not
satisfied
with
it.
She
wanted
to
know
how
she
could
perfect
her
piece
in
every
possible
way.
We
deliberated
over
paragraph
structure,
passive
voice,
semi-colons,
and
many
other
aspects
that
could
either
enhance
or
diminish
her
work.
An
excellent
writer,
she
asked
me
numerous
questions
that
I
had
never
even
thought
of
until
she
looked
to
me
for
answers.
Several
times
throughout
the
conference,
I
was
forced
to
turn
to
St.
Martin's
Handbook.
I
possessed
a
feeling
of
contentment,
and
also
relief,
when
I
could
answer
her
inquiries
fully
and
accurately.
The
conference
lasted
over
an
hour,
but
it
was
definitely
time
well
spent,
for
I
gained
just
as
much
as
she
did.
The
scariest
experience
I
had
last
year
as
a
Writing
Associate
was
when
I
was
assigned
to
a
300-level
English
course.
Although
I
was
happy
to
have
the
opportunity
to
work
for
the
program
again,
I
was
nervous
about
giving
advice
to
upperclassmen.
A
sophomore
at
the
time,
I
believed
that
my
suggestions
would
not
be
taken
seriously.
Another
fear
also
seized
me:
What
if
I
have
no
advice
to
give
to
these
students
who
would
probably
be
better
writers
than
I
am.
Before
I
even
scheduled
conferences
or
read
their
papers,
I
had
to
overcome
many
self-doubts.
When
the
day
for
my
first
round
of
conferences
arrived,
I
was
quite
apprehensive
and
did
not
know
what
to
expect.
However,
the
students
seemed
very
receptive
to
my
comments.
I
could
sense
their
maturity
and
I
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
would
listen
to
any
advice
that
could
help
them
improve
their
papers.
Also,
they
were
more
willing
to
share
their
opinions
and
talk
about
their
ideas
than
the
students
I
worked
with
in
the
First
Year
Seminar
were.
As
a
Writing
Associate,
I
have
learned
numerous
lessons
about
other
writers
and
myself.
I
have
discovered
that
an
effective
WA
should
adapt
to
each
writer's
different
needs,
should
listen
to
students
more
than
speak
to
them,
and
should
always
remember
to
emphasize
every
writer's
potential
to
write
better.
While
I
thought
I
understood
these
demands
before
I
joined
the
program,
I
did
not
realize
the
importance
of
these
qualities
until
I
encountered
real-life
situations
with
other
writers.
