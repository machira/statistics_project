Writing
as
a
WA
During
my
freshman
year
in
Lafayette
I
had
some
disappointments
about
my
writing
in
English,
which
is
my
third
language.
For
this
reason,
I
wanted
to
have
a
really
extensive
writing
experience
my
sophomore
year,
so
I
took
three
writing
classes,
worked
as
a
WA
both
semesters,
and
did
EXCEL
research
with
an
English
professor
during
the
year
and
summer.
All
of
these
experiences
had
a
profound
impact
on
the
way
I
write
and
the
way
I
see
myself
as
a
writer.
In
the
fall
semester,
I
took
Professor
WashingtonOs
class
on
Baldwin.
It
was
a
three-hundred-level
writing
class,
so
I
felt
a
bit
uneasy
deciding
to
take
it.
I
was
very
challenged
all
along,
but
in
the
end
it
was
greatly
rewarding.
We
did
a
lot
of
reading
of
BaldwinOs
fiction
and
writing
about
it,
and
the
issues
that
Baldwin
was
writing
about
such
as
homophobia
and
racism
were
very
new
to
me,
so
I
got
really
involved
and
interested.
Although
the
fact
that
Professor
Washington
liked
to
tease
and
provoke
people
in
the
class
got
a
bit
overwhelming
at
times,
overall
this
class
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
best
I
took
here
in
Lafayette.
I
wrote
two
ten-page
papers
for
this
class.
One
was
on
the
role
of
religion
in
a
black
personOs
life
in
BaldwinOs
novels,
and
the
second
dealt
with
the
role
masculinity
played
in
racism
and
homophobia.
I
think
this
second
one
is
one
of
the
best
and
most
interesting
papers
I
have
ever
written.
I
did
not
have
much
experience
writing
big
critical
literary
papers
before
this
class,
so
it
was
a
whole
new
thing
for
me.
The
other
class
that
I
took
in
the
fall
was
Literary
History
taught
by
Professor
Cefalu.
He
was
always
saying
that
it
was
not
a
Literary
History
class
but
more
a
class
about
Literary
History.
We
read
many
different
works,
for
example,
MoreOs
Utopia,
MiltonOs
Paradise
Lost,
HuxleyOs
Brave
New
World
and
many
others.
Then
in
our
essays,
we
had
to
argue
about
different
ways
to
group
those
texts,
for
instance,
chronologically
vs.
thematically.
We
also
read
some
literary
criticism
that
we
had
to
include
in
our
writings.
This
class
was
very
challenging
for
me
as
well,
probably
because
the
approach
in
our
papers
was
not
supposed
to
be
a
critical
analysis
of
the
texts
we
read,
but
we
were
supposed
to
argue
about
literary
criticism
and
only
use
the
texts
as
support
for
the
abstract
ideas
we
were
arguing
about.
For
me
it
meant
that
my
papers
would
have
to
be
more
analytical
and
better
thought
out
from
the
beginning
to
the
end,
trying
to
prevent
any
kind
of
logical
gaps.
For
this
reason
my
organizational
skills
have
improved
a
lot
in
this
class.
I
also
realized
that
the
more
conceptual
and
abstract
the
ideas
of
my
papers
became
the
more
fun
I
had
writing.
After
taking
these
two
challenging
writing
classes
I
had
to
take
a
VAST
in
my
spring
semester,
and
obviously
I
was
really
annoyed
by
this
fact.
Rather
than
having
a
chance
to
take
another
English
class,
I
felt
like
I
was
wasting
my
time
on
something
that
seemed
like
a
step
back.
In
the
end,
of
course
there
was
no
way
around
it
so
I
decided
to
make
the
best
out
of
it.
I
was
very
happy
to
take
a
class
with
Professor
Kimber.
It
was
called
Property
and
Theft.
We
studied
about
the
concept
of
property
and
how
one
can
come
to
own
something.
Then
we
moved
into
more
contemporary
issues
that
involve
important
ethical
concerns
such
as
the
property
of
a
human
body,
and
issues
of
slavery,
prostitution,
and
organ
trade.
We
also
studied
copyright.
It
was
interesting
to
see
how
all
of
these
issues
boil
down
to
the
concept
of
property
and
the
way
we
define
it.
In
general,
it
was
an
easy
class,
we
watched
a
lot
of
movies,
and
I
learnt
about
some
interesting
contemporary
issues,
but
I
do
not
think
that
the
class
did
any
good
for
my
writing
skills.
The
papers
were
short
and
not
demanding
at
all,
and
I
never
got
really
involved
in
writing
them.
I
did
have
some
petty
problems
with
grammar,
especially
the
use
of
articles,
in
the
beginning
of
the
class.
However,
later
Shawn
Kimber
decided
that
I
will
probably
always
write
with
an
accent,
so
it
is
better
to
ignore
it.
I
also
did
a
year-long
EXCEL
project
with
Professor
Bill
Carpenter
that
involved
a
great
deal
of
writing.
In
the
fall
semester,
my
work
was
mostly
research
and
reading,
but
in
the
second
semester
I
started
writing
about
the
things
that
we
were
researching.
Some
of
it
was
just
notes,
but
I
also
started
attempting
to
do
a
rhetorical
analysis
of
certain
political
speeches,
letters
to
the
editor,
editorials
and
other
writings.
I
also
did
a
brownbag
on
the
stuff
I
was
working
on.
Most
of
the
writing,
however,
happened
over
the
summer.
I
wrote
several
ten-page
long
discussions
of
certain
books
that
I
read.
And
finally,
I
produced
a
fifteen-page
article
arguing
that
the
Presidents
support
for
the
marriage
amendment
in
2004
was
actually
a
wedge
issue.
I
think
I
learned
a
lot
from
this
research.
The
most
important
thing
is
probably
doing
independent
research
-
developing
an
interest
in
a
specific
area,
searching
for
primary
and
secondary
sources
on
the
subject,
analyzing
and
organizing
it,
and
finally
evaluating
it
in
one
piece
of
writing.
Besides,
these
three
classes
and
EXCEL
research
I
also
learned
a
great
deal
about
writing
from
my
job
as
a
Writing
Associate.
In
the
fall
semester,
I
was
a
WA
for
Professor
Bill
CarpenterOs
First
Year
Seminar
on
Political
Campaign
Rhetoric.
It
was
fun
because
the
presidential
campaign
was
going
on
in
the
US
at
the
same
time.
It
was
very
rewarding
being
a
WA
for
this
class.
Not
only
I
learned
a
lot
myself
about
both
writing
and
commenting
papers,
but
I
also
felt
like
I
was
really
very
helpful
for
the
students.
The
conferences
often
ran
for
the
entire
thirty
minutes
and
I
would
only
cover
the
most
important
of
the
points
that
I
wanted
to
cover.
The
conferences
almost
always
developed
into
a
mutual
discussion
of
the
papers.
It
was
never
just
me
preaching
on
how
to
write.
The
students
were
very
interested
in
writing
their
papers
and
it
seemed
effortless
for
me
to
involve
them
into
a
conversation
and
get
them
ask
questions.
Although
it
was
only
my
first
semester
being
a
WA
I
felt
like
I
managed
to
be
really
useful.
Now
I
understand
that
I
owe
much
of
this
efficiency
for
Professor
Bill
Carpenter.
He
was
involved
with
the
College
Writing
program
himself,
so
he
knew
very
well
what
the
responsibilities
a
WA
had.
This
made
it
really
easy
for
me
to
work
with
him
and
his
class.
He
made
sure
that
the
students
took
the
WA
seriously
and
would
not
miss
the
conferences.
Professor
Carpenter
always
handed
out
a-page-long
paper
assignments,
which
were
very
elaborate
and
clear.
This
made
the
WA
conferences
so
mush
easier
because
I
always
specifically
knew
what
he
wanted
in
the
papers
and
what
I
should
be
talking
about
with
the
students.
It
made
it
a
lot
easier
for
them
too.
Furthermore,
the
assignments
were
really
interesting
and
the
students
were
very
enthusiastic
about
their
papers.
It
was
really
interesting
for
me
to
read
them
as
well.
I
feel
like
I
learned
a
lot
from
these
papers
as
if
I
took
the
class
myself.
My
next
semester
WA
experience
was
the
exact
opposite
of
the
first
one.
I
was
assigned
to
be
a
WA
for
Professor
Fabricand-PersonOs
VAST
class.
It
was
dealing
with
the
shifting
perspectives
of
Japanese
culture.
All
the
students
in
the
class
only
took
it
because
they
had
to.
No
one
was
really
interested
in
the
Japanese
culture.
The
students
just
wanted
an
easy
class
to
get
it
over
with.
They
were
often
late
to
the
conferences
and
occasionally
skipped
and
rescheduled
them.
They
often
did
not
even
have
a
draft
when
they
came
and
were
only
starting
to
think
about
the
assignments.
When
they
came
in
with
a
draft
they
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
what
I
was
saying
anyway.
The
students
were
clearly
thinking
that
they
were
wasting
their
time
with
the
WA
conferences
and
the
class
in
general,
and,
worst
of
all,
I
was
thinking
the
same
way
too.
The
paper
assignments
were
always
short
and
even
after
talking
to
the
professor
I
was
not
absolutely
sure
what
she
wanted
the
students
to
write
about
and
what
would
make
a
good
paper.
Later
I
and
the
students
realized
that
she
was
not
at
all
demanding
and
it
was
quite
easy
to
get
an
A,
so
the
interest
in
improving
the
papers
through
the
WA
conferences
dropped
even
lower.
During
all
of
the
semester
I
was
feeling
that
the
writing
program
has
failed
miserably
in
this
case.
I
did
not
want
to
blame
myself
for
these
problems
because
last
semester
with
Professor
Bill
CarpenterOs
class
I
was
very
successful,
and
I
only
got
better
afterwards.
I
feel
really
bad
saying
this
but
I
would
assign
most
of
the
blame
to
the
professor.
It
was
the
first
time
she
was
working
with
a
WA
and
she
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
from
me.
At
first
she
just
wanted
me
to
proofread
the
papers.
She
did
not
allow
any
time
for
the
WA
conferences
in
the
syllabus
and
she
misspelled
my
name
there.
This
of
course
did
not
make
the
students
take
their
WA
seriously.
Of
course,
later
I
worked
all
of
these
problems
out
with
her,
and
everything
ran
smoother.
I
am
sure
it
was
a
learning
experience
for
both
of
us.
She
learned
how
to
better
make
use
of
the
WAOs
and
what
to
expect
from
them,
and
I
learned
how
to
better
work
with
a
professor.
I
understand
that
it
was
wrong
from
me
to
expect
a
professor
to
be
perfect.
Now
I
know
that
they
are
also
human
and
make
mistakes.
And
although
they
are
teaching
us,
in
many
ways
they
are
students
themselves.
This
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
things
that
I
learned
from
being
a
WA.
Now
I
understand
the
professors
better.
I
know
what
they
expect
from
studentsO
writing,
I
also
know
how
hard
it
is
to
objectively
grade
a
paper,
especially
when
the
assignment
is
not
specific
enough.
For
these
reasons,
I
started
to
communicate
with
my
professors
a
lot
more.
It
does
not
matter
if
it
is
for
a
class
or
for
a
job;
I
always
want
to
make
sure
I
understand
their
expectations
and
criteria
of
evaluation.
In
the
beginning
when
I
started
working
as
a
WA,
I
assumed
that
it
was
the
hardest
to
find
the
faults
of
the
papers.
Now
I
know
that
it
is
so
much
more
complicated.
Being
a
WA
for
me
is
about
communication.
Politeness
and
tact,
understanding
and
eloquence
with
both
professors
and
students
are
a
lot
more
important
than
simply
commenting
on
the
papers.
ThatOs
why
I
am
coming
back
to
be
a
WA
next
year.
I
think
these
are
the
areas
that
I
have
to
improve
in.
