My
history
as
a
writer
began
long
before
I
ever
picked
up
a
pen
or
a
pencil.
It
began
when,
as
a
baby,
my
mother
would
read
Betty
Bear's
Birthday
and
the
rhymes
of
Mother
Goose
to
me.
She
introduced
me
to
the
world
of
reading
and
I
took
off
running.
By
the
time
I
was
four,
I
was
able
to
read
on
my
own.
Even
then
I
was
very
ambitious.
I
did
not
read
the
"Golden
Books"
children's
stories
like
most.
I
would
sit
on
my
father's
lap
and
he
would
read
the
sports
section
of
the
newspaper
while
I
would
read
the
funnies.
I
would
read
anything
and
everything
I
could
get
my
hands
on.
Back
then,
the
books
of
I
.aura
Ingalls
Wilder
and
the
Bobbsey
Twins
mysteries
fed
my
imagination.
Now,
the
books
of
John
Grisham
keep
my
up
at
night
unable
to
put
them
down
while
Shakespeare's
plays
make
me
laugh
and
cry.
While
I
loved
to
read,
writing
was
something
for
which
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
develop
a
love.
In
elementary
school,
I
detested
writing.
I
did
not
feel
this
way
because
it
was
difficult
for
me,
but
because
my
handwriting
was
terrible.
At
best
it
appeared
messy.
At
worst
it
was
totally
illegible.
My
mother
would
make
me
copy
things
over
and
over
until
it
would
be
acceptable
to
hand
into
the
teacher.
I
got
so
sick
of
writing.
I
guess
the
dread
that
I
had
for
school
writing
made
it
natural
that
my
first
memorable
experience
as
a
writer
came
with
an
attempt
at
pure
fun.
In
the
sixth
grade,
I
decided
I
wanted
to
write
a
book.
I
guess
you
would
call
it
a
modem
fairy
tale.
"Cinderella"
meets
Romeo
and
Juliet.
My
main
character
was
Brittany.
Now,
I
realize
that
she
was
what
I
wanted
to
be--
smart,
beautiful,
and
very
very
wise.
The
hero
was
the
noble
and
dashing
Devon.
Together
they
tned
to
foil
the
machinations
of
the
evil
Miranda,
an
aunt
with
whom
the
orphan
Brittany
lived.
I
had
a
carefully
planned
beginning,
climax,
and
end
worked
out
in
my
head
before
I
started
to
write.
I
attacked
the
story
for
an
hour
or
two
each
night.
I
got
bogged
down
in
the
middle,
however,
and
soon
realized
it
was
hopeless.
I
was
not
destined
to
be
a
famous
author
at
the
ripe
old
age
of
twelve.
The
attempt
taught
me
an
important
lesson,
though.
I
learned
that
I
could
have
fun
writing
and
I
knew
that
it
would
not
be
my
final
attempt.
In
eighth
grade,
my
friend
Bridget
introduced
me
to
the
type
of
writing
that
has
been
the
most
enjoyable
for
me,
poetry.
She
showed
me
some
poems
she
wrote,
and
I
soon
decided
to
try
to
write
my
own.
My
poems
are
not
good
and
I
will
be
the
very
first
to
admit
it.
They
are
sing
song,
structured
more
around
rhyme
than
rhythm,
but
they
have
become
my
companions
and
my
escape
from
the
difficulties
I
have
faced.
I
get
very
connected
when
I
write
poems.
The
funny
thing
about
it
is
I
can
only
write
poetry
when
I
am
upset
or
worried.
I
let
go
of
my
deepest
feelings
of
anger,
pain,
sorrow,
and
fear.
Because
this
type
of
writing
is
so
personal
for
me,
it
is
the
type
I
have
the
most
difficulty
sharing
with
others.
There
is
only
one
person
I
let
read
my
poems,
my
friend
Angie.
Angie
also
writes
poetry,
very
good
poetry.
She
listens
with
an
open
mind
and,
although
she
never
comments
much,
I
know
she
understands
my
feelings
because
of
my
words,
she
can
pick
out
and
pinpoint
exactly
what
1
cannot
communicate
by
speaking
to
her.
My
poetry
lets
me
communicate
more
effectively
to
her
when
I
am
in
need
of
help.
By
letting
go
of
dark
feelings
through
my
poems
I
am
also
more
able
to
effectively
communicate
with
others
because
by
that
time
my
venom
is
gone,
and
I
possess
a
more
rational
and
calm
mind
to
deal
with
my
problems.
When
I
began
high
school,
I
encountered
the
people
who
have
been
the
most
influential
in
my
writing.
They
were
three
teachers.
Mr.
Beviglia,
Mrs.
Kuhn,
and
Ms.
Morgan.
Mr.
Beviglia
taught
Sophomore
English.
In
his
class
we
read
many
different
genres
and
writers.
He
introduced
me
to
my
favorite
poet,
John
Donne.
He
also
showed
us
that
there
were
multiple
ways
to
interpret
writing
and
to
write
ourselves.
I
was
not
afraid
to
express
myself
in
my
papers
and
I
was
able
to
take
the
criticism
of
others
while
not
losing
sight
of
what
I
saw
as
my
style
of
writing's
strengths.
Mr.
Beviglia
also
recommended
me
for
acceptance
into
the
Advanced
Placement
English
sequence.
That
year
I
also
developed
a
bad
habit
that
took
me
a
long
time
to
break
out
of.
I
would
write
one
draft
of
a
paper,
revise
it
once
(for
spelling
and
grammar
only)
and
hand
it
in.
Miraculously,
at
that
point,
what
I
turned
in
was
good
enough
to
earn
A's.
It
caught
up
with
me
later
on
though.
During
my
Junior
year,
I
began
the
AP
sequence
with
British
Literature.
We
ran
the
gamut
of
reading
from
The
Canterbury
Tales
to
A
Clockwork
Orange.
Mrs.
Kuhn
was
the
teacher.
Her
policy
was
not
to
give
us
tests
but
to
grade
us
solely
on
our
papers
and
our
final
term
paper.
Most
of
the
papers
were
short
and
my
draft
and
final
method
got
me
through.
Mi
s.
Kuhn
introduced
us
to
the
writing
of
the
term
paper.
That
experience
was
important
for
my
writing
because
it
taught
me
how
to
do
research
using
the
tools
available
in
a
library.
This
was
my
first
exposure
to
the
skills
I
would
need
to
write
effectively
in
college.
It
was
one
of
my
favorite
classes,
but
I
was
still
hopelessly
unaware
of
the
problems
with
my
writing.
My
waiting
had
two
major
problems.
I
was
too
emotionally
attached
to
my
writing.
I
needed
to
have
the
attitude
a
doctor
has
towards
her
patients.
Care
for
them
and
heal
them
but
do
not
get
attached
to
them.
I
could
write
and
care
about
my
work
but
I
could
not
stay
detached.
As
a
result,
I
took
it
as
a
personal
affront
when
someone
criticized
my
writing.
I
would
not
care
if
it
was
garbage.
It
was
my
garbage
and
how
dare
someone
criticize
it.
After
all,
it
they
could
not
interpret
it
the
way
I
did
when
I
was
writing
it,
it
was
entirely
their
problem
and
not
mine!
My
second
problem
was
that
I
had
that
rapid
fire
delivery
of
papers
that
I
had
discussed
before.
I
would
write
a
paper
once
and
never
ever
revise
for
content.
I
believed
my
best
work
came
out
on
the
first
attempt.
It
was
a
poor
excuse
to
mask
my
laziness
in
writing.
I
did
not
want
to
put
die
time
in.
Plus,
I
had
enough
intelligence
that
many
times
one
shot
was
good
enough.
I
will
always
wonder
how
much
better
my
writing
would
be
today
if
I
spent
more
time
on
it
in
high
school.
Those
problems
all
came
sharply
into
focus
when
I
took
AP
American
literature
with
Ms.
Morgan.
She
was
easily
the
most
demanding
teacher
I
had
in
high
school.
She
tested
often
and
gave
us
many
papers
to
write.
In
the
beginning
of
the
class
my
grades
were
good,
in
the
low
90's.
There
were
two
things
that
really
frightened
me
though.
First,
Ms.
Morgan
consistently
commented
on
my
papers
that
I
did
not
analyze
enough,
and
I
missed
the
bigger
issues
in
the
novels
or
stories.
My
teachers
had
always
emphasized
that
analysis
was
a
technique
critical
in
college.
To
think
that
I
lacked
in
this
basic
area
made
me
wonder
if
I
was
cut
out
to
do
high
caliber
college
work
effectively.
Second,
she
told
us
that
one
month
later
the
same
caliber
papers
would
cam
us
grades
that
were
five
to
ten
points
lower.
A
91
I
could
deal
with.
An
81
frightened
me
because
I
knew
transcripts
were
important
to
the
colleges
in
which
I
was
interested.
Ms.
Morgan
helped
me
to
identify
my
most
common
"careless"
errors.
I
always
would
switch
tenses
and
I
often
lapsed
into
the
passive
voice
when
I
wrote.
I
also
had
a
tendency
to
be
too
wordy.
As
a
result
many
of
my
sentences
were
awkward
and
stilted.
She
showed
me
that
in
my
writing
less
often
meant
much,
much
more.
I
corrected
those
errors
fairly
easily
but
I
could
not
get
past
the
analysis
error.
Finally
she
assigned
a
paper
on
The
Great
Gatsby.
I
decided
that
I
was
going
to
work
my
heart
out
and
if
it
still
was
not
good
enough
I
would
stop
trying
to
please
her.
I
read
deeply
into
the
text
and
tried
to
picture
myself
as
the
character
on
whom
I
was
focusing.
1
wrote
the
paper
and
then
rewrote
it
and
rewrote
it
and
rewrote
it
again.
I
turned
in
the
paper
knowing
I
had
done
my
best
possible
work.
I
was
ecstatic
when
the
paper
came
back
with
a
"Well
Done"
on
the
top.
Ms.
Morgan
made
no
comments
about
my
analysis.
I
was
thrilled
and
relieved,
and
I
had
learned
an
important
lesson.
I
needed
to
always
be
that
focused
on
my
work
and
that
tenacious
with
it.
I
realized
that
a
paper
meant
nothing
if
I
did
not
do
my
best.
I
understood
that
as
the
courses
I
took
got
more
sophisticated,
I
had
to
adjust
my
work
to
match.
I
know
it
sounds
so
obvious
but
I
really
had
no
clue.
The
rest
of
the
year
went
smoothly.
We
had
to
write
a
fifteen
page
term
paper
at
the
end
of
the
year,
and
there
I
learned
more
about
the
study
habits
I
needed
for
college.
I
decide
to
be
brave
and
choose
The
Age
of
Innocence
by
Edith
Wharton,
a
book
we
never
covered
in
class.
I
was
on
my
own.
Ms.
Morgan
requires
at
least
five
sources
and
made
us
write
three
bibliographic
essays
about
our
sources.
I
realized
that,
since
I
had
to
scrutinize
the
sources
carefully
for
the
essay,
it
would
be
to
my
advantage
to
write
the
portions
of
my
paper
that
pertained
to
those
sources
at
the
same
time.
This
saved
me
a
lot
of
time
in
the
end
because
I
wrote
when
I
was
most
familial-
with
the
sources
so
I
did
not
need
to
waste
lots
of
time
searching
for
the
right
passages
to
support
my
analysis.
In
this
way,
I
could
not
procrastinate
the
paper.
This
skill
helped
me
greatly
in
my
first
year
of
college.
The
ironic
part
is
that
I
didn't
realize
all
this
until
last
year.
When
I
finished
with
AP
and
Ms.
Morgan,
I
swore
up
and
down
that
I
would
never
tell
anyone
to
take
that
class.
It
was
more
work
than
it
was
worth
I
thought.
Coming
to
Lafayette
proved
me
very,
very
wrong.
This
spring
my
sister
asked
me
if
she
should
sign
up
for
the
AP
sequence
and
I
told
her,
"
It
is
the
best
thing
you
can
do!".
When
I
prepared
to
enter
college,
I
was
apprehensive.
I
was
unsure
if
high
school
had
prepared
me
for
the
rigors
of
college.
I
feared
that
my
problems
I
had
recognized
in
the
past
year
would
come
back
to
haunt
me.
My
First
Year
Seminar
and
my
Writing
Associate
helped
me
to
calm
those
fears.
In
my
first
paper
for
the
seminar,
I
had
to
take
two
stories
summarize
them,
and
then
compare
and
contrast
them
in
light
of
a
technique
of
literary
analysis.
Great!
An
analysis
paper
right
off
the
bat.
I
was
petrified.
I
decided
to
just
take
my
time
and
make
sure
I
was
thorough
about
the
writing.
In
my
conference
with
my
WA,
she
made
me
feel
veiy
comfortable.
She
helped
me
find
ideas
that
were
weak
or
incomplete,
and
together
we
were
able
to
round
them
out
until
I
felt
confident
that
I
could
finish
the
paper.
She
always
let
me
know
that
her
ideas
were
only
her
opinion
and
I
could
use
them
or
discard
them
as
I
saw
fit.
That
freedom
aided
my
ability
to
develop
new
ideas
without
feeling
pressure
to
please
her,
even
if
I
was
uncomfortable
with
her
suggestions.
She
also
had
an
open
mind
when
we
discussed
my
meaning.
When
I
would
explain
what
1
meant
by
a
passage,
I
often
gained
new
perspective
on
my
writing
and
the
way
others
interpreted.
By
talking
and
reasoning
it
out
I
received
more
clarity
on
often
muddled
ideas.
My
WA
also
helped
to
evaluate
my
own
papers
honestly.
I
no
longer
looked
at
it
as
an
attack
on
my
writing
and,
as
a
result,
on
me.
I
realized
she
genuinely
wanted
to
see
me
do
better
on
the
papers
and
in
my
class.
I
had
confidence
in
her
ability
to
help
me
improve
my
writing.
The
paper
I
wrote
for
the
second
conference
was
garbage
and
I
knew
it.
I
just
did
not
enjoy
the
topic,
and
I
could
get
the
paper
to
flow.
I
think
I
gave
up
too
easily
on
the
project.
It
was
a
difficult
time
for
me
to
write.
I
was
completely
uninspired.
As
soon
as
I
walked
into
the
room
I
apologized
for
the
quality
of
the
paper.
Instead
of
tearing
it
apart,
my
WA
helped
me
find
the
interesting
parts
of
the
paper
and
develop
transitions
that
turned
my
garbage
into
a
better
piece
of
writing.
I
realized,
though,
that
I
need
to
be
able
to
do
that
myself,
even
if
the
topic
is
less
than
enjoyable
for
me.
By
the
time
I
had
my
conference
for
my
final
paper
in
the
class,
I
knew
that
I
had
written
a
really
good
paper.
I
loved
the
topic
had
chosen
and
I
really
took
my
time
with
the
research
to
make
sure
I
treated
the
topic
thoroughly.
I
also
experienced
something
strange
while
I
was
writing
that
last
paper.
I
found
myself
consciously
aware
of
my
WA's
probable
comments.
That
awareness
allowed
me
to
correct
many
problems
I
had
with
the
paper
as
I
went
along.
By
the
time
1
handed
in
the
paper
for
the
conference,
I
knew
it
was
almost
complete.
That
conference
was
the
most
productive
one
that
my
WA
and
I
had.
She
helped
me
complete
several
weak
ideas
and
gave
me
one
that
really
polished
my
paper.
I
owe
her
a
lot
because
she
never
gave
me
the
answers
but
pointed
me
down
the
roads
that
turned
average
papers
into
really
good
pieces
of
writing.
Her
advice
and
warnings
will
help
me
for
the
rest
of
my
writing
career,
I
am
sure.
The
professors
I
have
had
so
far
have
also
had
a
great
impact
on
my
writing
career.
My
professor
for
my
seminar
was
a
great
influence
on
my
writing.
She
encouraged
me
to
try
challenging
topics
and
always
was
there
to
give
me
guidance
and
help
me
focus
my
ideas.
In
our
first
conference
she
said
that
I
had
a
talent
for
summarization.
I
thought
of
my
experience
in
AP
and
realized
that
it
was
benefitting
my
college
writing.
The
best
experience
I
had
with
a
professor
had
to
be
when
a
philosophy
professor
praised
my
ability
to
analyze
issues
and
pinpoint
what
was
important
in
the
essay
questions
on
our
tests.
I
think
that
was
the
high
point
of
my
writing
career.
My
worst
fears
about
tackling
college
writing
were
erased
in
one
sentence.
I
know
I
still
need
work
but
that
comment
gives
me
great
confidence
for
the
rest
of
my
career.
My
career
goal
is
to
become
a
lawyer.
I
want
to
do
public
interest
work,
probably
targeting
domestic
violence.
That
means
that
I
will
have
a
long
career
as
a
writer
ahead.
Law
school
and
its
endless
briefs
as
well
as
the
documentation
that
I
will
need
to
provide
in
practice.
My
writing
will
be
constantly
evolving
and
changing.
I
know
that
I
have
much
work
ahead
of
me.
Writing
is
a
continuous
process
and
one
that
I
think
can
always
be
improved.
That
will
be
my
challenge.
I
need
to
be
exposed
to
new
styles
and
methods
of
arguments.
I
think
that
is
why
I
actually
enjoy
research
papers.
I
like
having
to
come
up
with
a
thesis
and
having
to
defend
it.
You
have
to
have
your
facts
down
cold.
I
enjoy
the
challenge
of
exploring
a
topic
on
which
there
has
not
been
a
lot
of
commentary.
I
am
hoping
to
write
a
senior
thesis
probably
in
government,
and
I
anxiously
await
that
opportunity.
I
think
it
will
place
the
greatest
demand
on
my
ability
as
a
writer,
but
I
cannot
wait
to
face
it
head
on.
Sometimes,
when
I
look
back
at
that
little
girl
who
hated
to
write
for
school,
I
cannot
believe
I
am
that
person.
Right
now,
I
love
to
write
and
to
share
that
experience
with
others.
I
hope
that
my
experience
as
a
Writing
Associate
will
help
me
give
that
love
to
others
and
will
help
me
in
my
attempt
to
add
to
my
writing
history!
