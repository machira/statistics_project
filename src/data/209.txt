Where
do
I
begin?
A
common
question
I
ask
myself
when
first
presented
with
a
writing
assignment,
thus
the
question
I
am
contemplating
at
this
moment.
I,
as
I
believe
many
writers
do,
find
the
beginning
lines
of
my
writing
to
be
crucial
to
the
success
of
its
outcome.
I
feel
that
with
a
strong
base
at
the
beginning,
there
is
much
more
support
for
development
throughout
the
work.
As
a
new
writing
associate,
I
have
been
asked
to
provide
a
description
of
my
writing
history.
I
believe
my
story
closely
parallels
the
scenario
I
previously
described.
I
became
interested
in
writing
at
a
very
young
age.
As
a
child,
I
was
constantly
exposed
to
the
work
of
others
through
bedtime
stories
and
fairy
tales.
Hearing
the
news
of
Chicken
Little's
sky
falling
to
the
ground
and
celebrating
the
triumph
of
the
engine
that
could,
I
fell
in
love
with
the
make
believe
world
of
the
genie's
lamp,
the
prince's
magical
touch,
and
the
deception
of
the
wicked
witch.
As
my
mother
repeated
these
stories
to
me,
only
one
detail
disturbed
me.
The
ending
was
always
the
same.
Never
once
did
the
witch
fully
deceive
the
naive
beauty,
nor
did
she
ever
have
the
chance
to
shed
her
evil
shell
because
those
are
the
rules
in
the
world
of
fantasy.
But
I
secretly
began
to
hope
for
the
sudden
triumph
of
the
one
already
predestined
to
lose.
Maybe
it
was
because
I
wanted
to
find
the
goodness
underneath
her
ugly
shell
of
wickedness,
maybe
it
was
my
sympathy
for
the
underdog
or
maybe
it
was
the
appeal
of
her
mischievous
actions
that
kept
my
interest.
Whatever
it
was,
the
alluring
image
of
fairy
tales
took
hold
of
my
young
mind
and
kept
my
interest
in
fiction
for
years
to
come.
Once
school
began
and
I
was
taught
the
use
of
pencil
and
paper,
I
immediately
utilized
them
as
my
tools
for
creation.
I
began
my
own
adventures
with
wizards
and
witches
as
a
new
world
of
characters
developed
in
my
black
and
white
marble
copybook.
In
second
grade,
some
of
my
friends
and
I
worked
with
a
teacher
who
formed
a
young
creative
writer's
club.
It
was
an
activity
that
lasted
only
a
couple
of
months
but
I
made
sure
I
was
always
there,
ready
to
write.
During
that
time,
I
remember
creating
a
story
about
magical
potions
and
flying
cars.
Now,
I
wonder
what
happened
to
that
story,
as
well
as
my
black
and
white
book.
They
must
have
been
misplaced
somewhere
between
cheering
practice
and
Girl
Scout
patches
where
my
interest
in
writing
was
lost
for
some
time.
Through
the
years
of
junior
high
and
even
my
Freshman
year
of
high
school
there
seemed
to
be
no
indication
that
the
pen
I
held
in
my
hand
would
ever
again
be
used
for
any
other
purpose
but
to
get
my
assignments
done.
I
saw
no
reason
to
improve
my
writing
because
I
was
receiving
high
marks
and
positive
compliments.
Writing
was
just
something
that
got
me
the
grades
I
wanted.
I
always
got
A's
on
my
papers.
I
simply
expected
it.
So,
I
knew
there
must
be
some
mistake
when
Ms.
Grausso,
my
tenth
grade
English
teacher,
handed
me
back
my
first
assignment
and
told
me
to
rewrite
it.
She
questioned
whom
I
thought
I
was
kidding
trying
to
hand
in
such
a
paper
in
an
honors
class.
She
had
discovered
my
secret,
although
I
did
not
know
it
yet
myself.
She
knew
that
I
could
do
better
and
that
if
I
wanted
to
continue
to
receive
A's
in
English
class,
I
was
going
to
have
to
find
the
real
writer
hidden
behind
those
big
words
all
the
other
teachers
accepted
as
A
deserving
vocabulary.
Ms.
Grausso
did
not
give
me
the
choice
that
day
to
give
up
and
simply
take
the
average
grade
for
the
average
effort
she
felt
I
had
put
into
it.
The
only
option
she
presented
to
me
was
to
rewrite
a
paper
I
had
already
convinced
myself
was
the
best
that
I
could
do.
But
my
vain
attempts
to
convince
her
only
sent
me
home
from
school
bitter
at
my
teacher
because
I
thought
the
only
way
to
get
an
A
in
her
class
was
to
write
the
way
she
wanted
me
to
write.
On
that
day,
early
in
my
second
year
of
high
school,
I
decided
that
I
did
not
like
this
teacher
and
perceived
the
year
would
simply
be
a
bust.
During
the
course
of
the
year,
however,
my
opinion
changed
and
by
the
last
day
of
school
I
was
thanking
Ms.
Grausso,
a
woman
whom
I
now
greatly
respect
and
admire.
By
that
time
I
realized
that
she
was
not
the
teacher
who
wanted
me
to
write
as
she
wanted,
but
rather
the
teacher
who
wanted
me
to
write
the
way
she
knew
I
could.
Our
final
assignment
in
her
class
was
to
write
a
fictional
piece
of
literature.
I
chose
to
write
an
additional
chapter
to
a
novel
we
had
read
earlier
in
the
year.
Now
was
my
chance
to
rewrite
the
ending
of
a
story,
the
very
aspect
of
writing
that
caught
my
attention
in
the
first
place
as
a
young
reader.
Following
our
exam
on
the
last
day
of
class,
I
picked
up
my
portfolio
with
the
grades
for
our
final
paper.
I
opened
the
cover
to
see
an
A+
on
the
top
of
the
page.
As
I
turned
to
leave
and
begin
my
summer,
Ms.
Grausso
pulled
me
aside
and
said,
"I
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
you
were
the
only
A+,
and
that
was
not
an
end
of
the
year
gift."
I
thanked
her
and
left
for
my
two
months
of
freedom,
proud
of
my
grade,
grateful
for
the
compliment,
but
still
not
a
writer
in
my
mind.
The
next
year,
my
eleventh
grade
teacher
was
not
as
interested
in
the
writing
aspect
of
English
class.
So,
another
year
passed
of
my
clever
schemes
to
quickly
write
papers
with
enough
one
hundred-point
vocabulary
words
to
coerce
her
into
giving
me
that
A.
It
was
my
senior
year
that
dramatically
changed
everything
for
this
writer.
This
was
the
year
I
realized
that
it
was
not
about
the
five-paragraph
essay
or
meeting
the
eight-sentence
requirement
to
make
a
complete
paragraph.
It
was
not
even
about
the
diction
and
syntax
we
were
so
well
trained
to
analyze
that
year
in
preparation
for
the
AP
exam.
Our
first
assignment
for
Mrs.
K.T.
Langton
was
to
write
an
essay
for
our
college
applications.
I
chose
the
question
asking
about
the
person
who
has
influenced
my
life
the
most.
The
person
I
chose
to
write
about
was
a
relative
of
mine
who
died
of
cancer
as
a
young
teenager.
Writing
about
her
brought
her
back
to
life
not
only
for
me
but
also
for
my
entire
family,
including
her
mother.
It
was
then
that
I
realized
the
power
of
my
pen.
It
was
then
that
I
realized
the
magic
of
writing
and
the
infinite
existence
of
an
author's
work.
Because
of
my
paper,
my
fourteen-year-old
cousin
will
live
forever;
influencing
the
lives
of
those
connected
to
her.
As
I
said
in
my
tribute
to
her,
she
helps
us
all
to
realize
the
preciousness
of
life
and
I
do
not
think
any
of
us
knew
that
until
it
was
written.
When
I
discovered
this
ability,
I
also
discovered
the
writer
who
had
been
hidden
for
so
long.
During
that
same
year
another
discovery
was
made
when
I
enrolled
in
a
creative
writing
class
my
second
semester.
When
I
decided
to
take
this
class
I
had
thought
of
creating
adventures
much
like
the
stories
I
wrote
as
a
child
and
engaging
in
freewriting
skills
that
would
encourage
a
flow
of
the
creative
energy
that
school
often
suppresses.
I
thought
it
would
be
an
excellent
change
from
the
formulated
writing
and
testing
requirements
of
other
classes.
But
I
mistakenly
neglected
to
recognize
the
obvious
genre
this
creative
writing
class
would
include,
poetry.
Poetry
had
always
been
my
roadblock
to
fully
appreciating
the
subject
of
writing
and
literature.
Excluding
a
few
inspirational
poems
and
the
songs
I
listened
to
on
the
radio,
I
possessed
no
interest
in
reading
or
listening
to
poetry,
and
there
was
no
exception
to
my
dislike
of
writing
it.
Each
time
a
poetry
assignment
was
given
in
a
class
I
would
cringe.
Following
weeks
of
writing
memoirs
and
fiction,
the
other
students
began
questioning
our
lack
in
the
poetic
area
of
writing.
I
hoped
it
would
simply
be
forgotten
and
we
could
all
continue
writing
reflections
of
our
past
and
dreams
of
our
future.
Well,
we
did
continue
to
do
these
things,
only
with
fewer
words.
The
dreaded
day
finally
came
when
my
teacher
entered
the
room
and
told
the
class
we
were
going
to
begin
a
poetry
exercise
outside.
But
to
make
circumstances
worse,
I
had
done
the
same
activity
in
my
English
class
only
a
few
hours
earlier.
I
questioned
why
I
had
even
bothered
to
drag
myself
into
the
world
of
academics
that
day
because
it
was
probably
the
worst
one
yet.
As
the
class
was
led
outside
to
engage
in
this
torturous
event,
my
teacher
informed
me
that
she
knew
I
had
already
done
this
exercise
that
morning.
A
glimmer
of
hope
leapt
in
my
heart
as
I
thought
I
was
being
exempt
from
my
role
as
a
poet.
Instead,
I
was
told
to
separate
myself
from
the
group
and
transform
the
essay
I
had
written
about
my
cousin
into
a
poem.
So,
not
only
did
she
ostracize
me
from
the
group,
but
I
also
had
to
return
to
her
with
a
poem
that
I
truly
did
not
believe
I
could
write.
As
I
separated
myself
from
the
others
and
found
my
own
steps
to
sit
on,
I
struggled
to
think
how
I
would
ever
manage
such
an
assignment.
I
thought
about
my
paper,
and
I
thought
about
my
cousin,
Lisa.
I
did
not
think
for
long
before
the
page
was
filled
and
my
poem
was
complete.
I
ran
my
eyes
over
the
words
again
and
again,
reading
the
steady
flow
that
ran
from
my
heart
to
my
pen
and
now
appeared
before
me
on
the
lines
of
that
yellow
tinted
paper.
As
I
typed
the
final
version
on
my
computer
that
night,
I
spelled
the
letters
of
my
name
underneath
my
typed
emotions,
and
that
poem
became
mine
along
with
the
fear
that
kept
me
from
it
in
the
first
place.
The
anxiety
was
gone.
Soon
after
these
events,
I
found
myself
preparing
for
the
real
life
adventure
of
college.
After
enduring
an
entire
year
of
AP
English,
in
which
my
work
was
tom
apart
and
dissected
to
the
point
of
barely
existing,
I
was
confident
in
the
improvement
of
my
skills.
I
was
ignorant
to
the
fact
that
this
was
college
writing
and
that
was
highschool
writing
and
advanced
ability
in
one
never
guarantees
success
in
the
other.
People
attempted
to
prepare
me
for
the
change
but
I
questioned
how
much
of
a
difference
there
could
actually
be
because
I
believed
writing
was
writing.
I
thought
that
AP
English
meant
advanced
placement
and
if
I
could
find
my
niche
there,
I
could
find
my
niche
here
also.
I
was
assigned
my
first
full-length
college
paper
a
few
weeks
into
the
semester.
I
had
no
trouble
choosing
my
topic;
however,
I
had
no
idea
how
to
approach
it.
My
purpose
was
to
critically
analyze
specific
aspects
of
a
novel
I
had
recently
read
for
the
class.
Suddenly,
I
realized
that
1
hardly
knew
what
Deconstractive
Criticism
was,
how
did
I
ever
expect
to
write
seven
to
eight
pages
on
how
it
relates
to
the
book.
I
had
ideas
in
my
head
I
thought
were
good
only
I
was
unsure
of
their
accuracy
and
the
words
I
wanted
to
use
to
explain
my
theory.
I
sat
thinking
for
a
long
time
and
the
only
thing
that
was
left
for
me
to
do
then
was
to
write.
I
reread
my
words
over
and
over
until
I
was
sure
they
were
saying
what
I
wanted
them
to
say.
But
when
I
received
my
first
writing
grade,
I
realized
that
either
what
I
said
was
not
correct
or
the
way
in
which
I
said
it
was
not
clear.
Not
knowing
exactly
what
people
do
in
college
when
they
receive
a
grade
they
deem
unsatisfactory,
I
did
what
seemed
to
be
the
most
obvious
option
by
going
straight
to
my
professor.
Together,
we
reviewed
my
work,
each
word
at
a
time.
As
she
explained
each
error
to
me,
I
slowly
began
to
realize
the
differences
between
college
and
highschool.
Even
though
I
thought
I
was
beginning
to
write
more
and
more
for
myself
in
highschool,
it
was
not
until
now
that
I
was
able
to
fully
take
credit
for
my
thoughts.
That
third
person
point
of
view
was
gone
the
voice
of
"I"
took
its
place
to
present
my
thoughts
to
the
reader.
1
needed
to
back
up
my
ideas
and
take
responsibility
for
them.
I
needed
to
dearly
state
the
facts
and
forget
about
the
fancy
vocabulary
words
if
there
is
no
room
for
them
because
sometimes
they
simply
crowd
the
lines,
leaving
no
space
for
consistency
in
the
argument.
After
meeting
with
my
professor,
I
rewrote
that
first
paper
and
resubmitted
my
work
with
confidence
because
I
believed
in
the
words
that
I
wrote
and
I
let
my
reader
know
it.
That
is
my
history
as
a
writer,
thus
far,
from
the
curious
child
to
the
enlightened
college
student.
As
I
stated
in
the
beginning,
a
strong
base
is
important
for
development,
not
only
in
the
result
of
a
composition,
but
also
the
writer
himself.
My
early
exposure
to
literature
provided
me
with
the
background
material
needed
to
continue
my
steps
in
writing.
So,
where
do
I
begin?
That
was
the
question
that
began
this
paper.
Now,
I
have
told
you
where
my
history
as
a
writer
began
and
that
story
continues
because
writers
are
always
revising,
not
only
their
work
but
also
their
skills.
I
have
learned
that
even
when
you
believe
that
there
is
nothing
else
that
can
be
done
to
make
your
work
better,
there
is
always
room
for
constructive
criticism
and
suggestions
for
improvement.
A
writer's
work
is
never
finished,
so
maybe
a
more
appropriate
question
to
ask
is
not
where
do
I
begin,
but
rather
where
do
I
end?
My
answer-1
don't.
