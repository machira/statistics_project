As
I
embark
upon
my
mission
as
a
Writing
Associate
for
the
third
year
in
a
row,
I
suppose
it
is
fitting,
(as
well
as
an
inevitable
part
of
my
assignment),
to
reflect
upon
what
this
last
year
as
a
WA
has
meant
to
me
as
a
writer.
While
this
has
been
one
of
the
most
formative
years
for
my
writing,
I
have
realized
that
there
is
a
very
fine
line
between
my
role
as
a
Writing
Associate
and
my
role
as
a
writer.
Initially,
the
whole
idea
that
I
was
a
WA
made
me
more
perceptive
when
it
came
to
critically
examining
a
piece
of
writing,
but
as
time
went
on,
writing
and
WA-ing
became
an
almost
simultaneous
employment.
Every
piece
of
writing
that
I
encounter,
whether
it
is
my
own
or
another's
is
automatically
analyzed,
and
every
paper
that
I
write
starts
off
with
the
same
question
I
begin
my
WA
appointments
with,
What
argument
or
idea
are
you
trying
to
get
across
to
your
audience?
This
intertwinement
of
WA-ing
and
writing
has
enabled
me
to
grow
and
develop
as
writer
and
has
prepared
me
to
confront
new
types
of
writing
with
a
confidence
in
what
I
have
learned.
As
a
returning
Writing
Associate,
I
was
placed
with
Prof.
Susan
Averett
and
was
given
the
opportunity
to
work
with
her
and
her
Economics
of
Labor
class.
I
must
admit,
as
a
WA
who
had
only
dealt
with
FYSs
and
VASTs
in
the
past,
I
was
terribly
nervous
about
being
a
Writing
Associate
for
an
upper
level
economics
class.
I
was
wracked
with
doubts
as
to
whether
I
would
indeed
be
a
good,
capable,
WA
or
if
I
would
be
at
a
disadvantage
since
I
had
never
taken
econometrics
and
lead
a
whole
class
of
senior
economic
majors
astray.
I
mean,
Professor
Averett
is
pretty
much
an
expert
when
it
comes
to
the
writing
of
an
econometrics
paper
(she
publishes
these
for
God
sakes!);
she
would
surely
have
stringent
guidelines
of
what
her
WA
had
to
do.
If
I
messed
up,
what
would
happen?
As
luck
would
have
it,
WA-ing
for
Professor
Averett's
class
turned
out
to
be
a
positive
and
very
educational
experience.
From
the
beginning,
I
was
able
to
discuss
all
the
details
of
the
class
and
the
assignments
with
her,
and
she
always
provided
me
with,
not
only
extra
information
on
the
class,
but
also
very
detailed
assignments
outlining
exactly
what
she
wanted
the
students
to
produce.
Besides
helping
me
when
it
came
to
the
appointments
with
the
students,
these
assignment
outlines
helped
me
with
my
own
writing
the
next
semester
when
I
had
Prof.
Averett's
class
and
had
to
craft
very
similar
papers.
In
the
WA
/
student
meetings,
I
had
a
virtual
checklist
of
the
problems,
data,
and
questions
Professor
Averett
wanted
her
students
to
probe,
and
if
something
was
missing,
we
could
go
back
and
discuss
a
way
to
incorporate
into
the
paper.
These
assignments
also
aided
me
in
working
with
the
students
on
the
idea
of
a
thesis,
which
I
found
to
be
the
biggest
problem
for
students
in
my
year
as
a
WA.
When
the
assignments
were
stated
in
this
clear
manner,
as
well
as
the
information
that
the
professor
wanted
included,
I
was
able
to
help
the
students
focus
their
papers
around
a
central
idea
or
argument
to
ultimately
write
a
cohesive,
well-executed
paper.
Even
further
than
allowing
me
to
have
more
productive
sessions
with
the
students,
these
assignment
packets
that
Professor
Averett
provided
helped
me
with
my
own
writing.
I
had
available
to
me
the
kinds
of
questions
I
should
be
asking
myself
when
I
write
an
econometrics
paper
and
the
amount
of
data
and
research
a
professor
would
expect
from
me
when
I
am
presenting
a
study.
Because
of
these
meetings
with
and
assignments
from
Professor
Averett,
I
began
to
really
identify
the
global
concerns
in
the
students'
papers
as
well
as
in
my
own
writing.
When
I
returned
to
school
on
January
after
a
full
year
and
a
half
of
WA-ing
under
my
belt,
I
felt
very
comfortable
taking
on
my
VAST
class
with
Professor
Bill
Best.
This
class,
however,
proved
to
be
a
challenge,
but
nonetheless
was
beneficial
to
my
experience
as
a
WA
and
a
writer.
The
subject
matter
in
this
particular
class
was
very
different
than
what
I
encountered
in
the
structured
economics
of
labor
class
from
the
previous
semester.
Professor
Best's
VAST
was
much
less
systematic
and
it
had
a
broad
focus
on
technological
catastrophes.
This
was
an
area
in
which
I
had
relatively
little
knowledge
so
it
was
very
important
that
I
conversed
with
Professor
Best
about
exactly
what
the
paper
topic
was
and
exactly
what
he
wanted
his
students
to
compose.
Unlike
the
econometrics
class,
Prof.
Best
gave
the
students
much
more
freedom
in
choosing
a
topic
they
wanted
to
research
and
study
and
in
how
they
could
present
this
topic.
In
these
papers
discussing
a
myriad
of
different
technological
catastrophes,
Professor
Best
urged
his
students
to
look
beyond
the
obvious
and
to
attempt
to
find
innovative
ways
for
examining
the
causes
of
these
technological
disasters.
As
a
WA
for
this
class,
I
had
to
become
much
more
flexible
and
become
an
extremely
critical
reader,
because
I
no
longer
had
a
structured
outline
to
follow.
Instead,
I
had
to
focus
on
each
individual
paper
and
topic
and
see
how
well
each
thesis
was
constructed
and
adhered
to.
Once
I
got
into
the
mode
of
critically
looking
at
every
unique
paper,
I
feel
became
more
adept
at
better
locating
both
global
and
local
concerns.
This
is
because
I
had
to
scrutinize
everything,
making
sure
it
was
truly
a
good
paper
and
not
a
paper
that
fits
what
the
professor
is
looking
for.
While
I
may
have
become
a
picky
and
questioning
WA,
the
concerns
I
bring
up
in
the
students'
papers
are
the
same
ones
I
look
for
when
writing
my
own
papers.
This
idea
of
asking
difficult
questions
about
the
cohesiveness
of
your
own
paper
has
been
a
skill
I
am
glad
to
have
developed.
These
two
semesters
(four
overall)
of
WA-ing
have
provided
me
with
the
knowledge
of
what
questions
to
ask
myself
about
my
paper
and
of
how
important
a
strong
thesis
is
in
tightly
binding
your
ideas
together.
Experiencing
this
past
year
as
a
Writing
Associate
has
prepared
me
for
the
new
types
of
writings
that
I
encountered
in
my
junior
year.
The
way
I
learned
to
question
and
critique
writing
was
especially
helpful
in
my
Shakespeare
class
and
in
my
econometrics
class,
because
these
courses
demanded
more
sophisticated,
thought-provoking
writing,
and
I
think
WA-ing
really
helped
prepare
me
for
this.
Writing
for
my
Shakespeare
class
was
similar
to
WA-ing
for
Economics
of
Labor.
In
only
three
to
five
pages
of
text,
I
had
to
present
an
argument
and
support
that
argument
with
research
and
my
own
knowledge
of
the
readings.
This
is
surprisingly
similar
to
writing
an
econometrics
paper,
where
you
present
your
objective,
show
your
research,
and
discuss
it
-
all
in
three
to
five
pages.
But,
working
with
the
VAST
also
was
beneficial
in
aiding
me
with
this
class.
Because
the
paper
topics
for
the
class
were
relatively
broad,
I
had
experience
with
generating
fresh
ideas
for
papers
as
a
result
of
the
way
Prof.
Best
structures
his
class
and
my
experiences
working
with
the
students.
Besides
helping
me
with
my
Shakespeare
class,
WA-ing
for
Economics
of
Labor,
obviously
helped
me
the
following
semester
when
I
took
econometrics.
Clearly,
I
knew
exactly
what
was
expected
of
me
when
I
handed
in
my
final
econometrics
project.
So,
needless
to
say,
my
experiences
this
year
as
a
writer
and
as
WA
were
essentially
one
in
the
same,
and
it
is
clearer
than
ever
that
writing
and
WA-ing
truly
function
in
tandem.
The
final
area
where
I
saw
how
WA-ing
aided
me
as
a
writer
was
when
I
had
to
compose
my
speech
for
the
Tech
Clinic
presentation,
and
the
notion
of
audience
truly
took
hold.
By
WA-ing
for
two
very
different
classes,
I
began
to
understand
what
writing
for
an
audience
meant,
and
this
was
a
great
help
when
it
came
time
for
the
final
presentation.
In
Professor
Averett's
class,
the
audience
was
always
herself,
the
students,
and
econometricians,
so
there
was
a
certain
structure
that
the
students
needed
to
follow
when
presenting
their
papers.
In
Professor
Best's
class
however,
the
audience
was
himself
was
only
himself
and
the
students,
which
allowed
much
more
freedom
and
creativity
in
the
works.
Going
from
paper
to
paper,
I
could
easily
see
the
shift
in
audience,
and
this
ensuing
consciousness
of
the
audience
you're
writing
for
is
a
skill
I
am
glad
to
have
acquired.
In
writing
my
Tech
Clinic
presentation,
I
was
very
aware
that
I
had
to
draft
a
speech
that
reached
out
to
members
of
the
Easton
Heritage
Alliance,
possible
monetary
donors,
and
members
of
the
community.
This
would
have
been
a
very
daunting
task
had
I
not
been
exposed
to
the
idea
of
audience
through
my
WA-ing.
It
has
become
very
evident
to
me
that
writing
and
WA-ing
benefit
each
other.
As
I
become
more
adept
at
one
occupation,
I
in
turn,
aid
the
other.
This
is
why
I
see
WA-ing
and
writing
as
ultimately
the
same,
and
my
experience
in
these
areas
this
year,
has
been
overall
very
formative
and
helped
me
greatly
to
improve
the
papers
I
produce.
