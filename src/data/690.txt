Literary
Narrative
W.A.
summer
2011
ItOs
been
a
long
time
since
I
stared
at
those
two
bold
blue
lines
on
the
yellow
tinged,
greasy
looking
paper.
Thick
reddish-purple
dashes,
much
like
those
on
a
road
divided
the
two
lines
in
an
attempt
to
guide
the
young
writerOs
hand.
It
was
the
culmination
of
months
or
perhaps
even
years
of
pre-school
preparation,
it
is
impossible
to
remember.
The
letters
had
been
drilled
into
our
young
minds
through
song
and
game
until
it
was
time
to
put
them
to
paper.
The
exercise,
spell
your
names.
A
simple
enough
task,
for
my
friends
Scott,
and
Zach,
and
Jake,
but
for
Jonathan,
this
seemed
insurmountable.
I
felt
an
early
taste
of
envy
as
I
struggled
to
produce
the
letters
of
my
absurdly
long
name,
squiggles
faintly
resembling
letters
appearing
slowly
on
the
page,
unsteady
hand
fighting
to
remain
within
the
lines.
Yet,
despite
the
early
frustrations
and
struggles,
letters
did
begin
to
appear,
and
one
day,
they
had
been
conquered.
Jonathan:
a
simple
word
to
write
really,
not
all
that
much
of
an
accomplishment
in
retrospect,
and
yet
the
beginning
of
something
truly
important.
From
it
was
merely
a
matter
of
expanding
my
vocabulary,
honing
it
over
the
remaining
years
of
my
life.
Soon
words
such
as
cat,
dog,
and
run
were
vanquished.
With
each
new
word,
the
letters
became
bolder
and
more
practiced.
The
massive
lines
on
the
page
became
less
necessary,
and
by
second
or
third
grade,
there
were
enough
lines
on
a
page
to
write
an
entire
collection
of
words,
not
just
one.
Now
that
the
letters
themselves,
the
vehicles
of
ideas
had
been
learned,
it
was
time
to
use
them
to
create.
Around
this
time,
a
concept
known
as
the
NsentenceO
was
introduced
to
us.
The
words
that
had
been
taught
to
us
had
meaning
beyond
their
letters,
and
when
combined,
had
further
meaning.
Through
these
letters,
I
could
tell
stories
about
my
weekends,
and
time
spent
outside
of
school.
My
teacher
learned
important
information
about
my
life,
such
as
the
fact
that
NI
like
soccerO,
and
NI
watched
t.v.
on
FridayO.
Perhaps,
these
were
not
the
worldOs
most
interesting
narratives,
but
they
were
a
start.
We
were
encouraged
to
keep
journals
during
the
week,
so
that
we
might
learn
to
describe
better
the
things
we
did
every
day.
After
enough
practice,
we
were
even
encouraged
to
make
things
up.
This
type
of
lying
was
perfectly
fine;
it
was
called
imagination,
and
soon
my
FridayOs
were
not
spent
watching
t.v.,
but
traveling
to
the
moon,
or
staring
at
dinosaurs.
By
third
grade,
an
entire
section
of
every
day
was
devoted
to
honing
our
imaginations,
and
crafting
NstoriesO.
The
paper
we
used
still
was
covered
with
blue
lines
and
bore
its
sickly
yellow
tinge,
but
it
now
had
enough
room
for
entire
Nrip-offsO
of
Holmes-esque
mysteries,
and
fantasized
versions
of
the
past.
My
teachers
helped
hone
my
work,
providing
commentary
on
my
as
yet
imperfect
prose.
These
teachers,
Ms.
Ramig,
Ms.
Cullen,
etc.
made
sure
no
part
of
speech
was
missing,
and
sentences
were
arranged
in
an
appropriate
order
so
that
they
may
have
NflowO.
NAssignmentsO
were
now
graded
on
a
NrubricO,
a
concept
heretofore
unheard
of,
and
what
was
expected
from
my
writing
was
more
clearly
defined.
If
my
sentences
did
not
follow
logic,
or
my
plots
were
ill-conceived,
I
was
now
sure
to
hear
of
it,
and
made
to
correct
the
issues
before
receiving
an
acceptable
mark.
Perhaps
fear
is
the
greatest
motivator,
for
the
worry
that
these
rubrics
brought
spurred
my
writing
to
new
heights.
My
stories
began
to
take
multiple
pages
to
play
out,
and
even
began
to
have
conflicts,
and
quite
possibly
resolutions.
Things
seemed
easy,
and
yet,
just
as
I
began
to
feel
comfortable
with
writing,
new
twists
were
introduced.
The
first
of
these
many
hurdles
in
the
path
to
literary
proficiency
was
the
introduction
of
the
idea
that
writing
was
not
simply
for
creating
stories.
Writing
was
no
longer
confined
to
fiction.
It
was
introduced
in
tasks
where
I
had
to
argue
a
point,
or
perhaps
even
explain
an
event
in
science,
or
even
math.
All
of
a
sudden,
writing
took
on
a
new
purpose.
It
was
no
longer
just
for
NfunO,
or
creative
purposes.
My
writing
became
a
means
of
sharing
information
and
observations
of
a
more
serious
nature.
My
style
had
to
change
at
these
times.
My
writing
needed
to
become
NdescriptiveO
and
OinformativeO,
a
completely
new
concept.
Descriptions
of
experiments,
and
reactions
in
science
flowed
from
my
pencil,
tales
of
liquids
reacting,
and
solids
melting.
Math
problems
were
solved
in
words
not
numbers,
the
boy
with
three
apples
who
received
one
more
had
four.
I
disagreed
with
statements
on
papers,
i.e.,
students
need
more
homework,
and
occasionally
even
supported
my
arguments
with
facts
i.e.
Nhomework
is
boringO.
A
new
writer
was
being
shaped.
This
writer
not
only
had
to
master
proper
structure,
and
flow,
but
had
to
use
that
technical
knowledge
both
to
create
and
inform,
to
dazzle,
and
explain.
For
four
years
of
elementary
school,
tasks
were
given
to
hone
these
skills.
Journals,
free-writing,
NessaysO,
Nopen-endedO
questions
all
became
facts
of
every-day
life,
and
by
the
time
I
was
ready
for
middle
school,
I
had
been
trained
for
the
rigorous
and
difficult
writing
that
would
follow.
Middle
school
is
the
beginning
of
what
I
would
call
Nadult-writingO.
Not
only
was
I
introduced
to
far
more
serious
topics,
and
far
more
serious
commentary,
but
to
more
serious
tools
as
well,
i.e.
the
computer.
All
of
a
sudden,
the
act
of
writing
no
longer
required
the
actual
act
of
writing.
I
was
now
required
to
take
the
skills
I
learned
and
type
them
into
a
machine
that
I
am
still
frankly
unsure
of
how
to
use.
The
old
Gateway
P.C.
my
family
owned
proved
up
to
this
new
task
of
holding
my
compositions
and
after
some
prolonged
trial
and
error,
Microsoft
Word
became
my
new
pen
and
paper.
Of
course,
this
new
medium
required
new
reactions
from
those
who
were
reading
my
writings.
For
the
first
time
in
my
entire
life,
my
writing
earned
overt,
and
on
occasion
harsh
criticism.
My
carefully
printed
pages
on
occasion
were
dotted
with
the
dreaded
red
ink
that
told
me
of
the
errors
of
my
prose,
the
limitedness
of
my
vocabulary,
and
the
lack
of
depth
of
my
plots.
Needless
to
say,
I
did
not
originally
react
to
this
criticism
with
poise
and
grace.
In
all
fairness,
most
people
have
difficulty
taking
criticism,
and
in
my
defense,
it
has
only
taken
me
about
six
years
to
get
over
my
anger
at
criticism
of
my
work.
At
the
time
however,
I
reacted
in
a
somewhat
less
mature
way,
namely,
I
did
next
to
nothing.
I
continued
to
write
the
way
I
always
had,
and
the
way
that
I
found
appropriate.
That
is
at
least
until
my
first
true
report
card
arrived
in
the
mail
and
I
realized
that
perhaps
this
was
not
the
wisest
path
to
take.
It
was
around
this
point
that
I
adopted
my
present
mantra
when
it
comes
to
writing.
When
you
write
for
school,
write
what
the
teacher
wants
you
too
write.
Adopt
the
style
they
seem
to
admire,
espouse
views
you
know
they
will
be
content
with,
or
if
you
canOt,
have
a
damn
good
argument
as
to
why.
Yet,
when
you
write
for
yourself,
let
yourself
come
out
once
again.
When
you
are
not
being
graded,
unleash
the
creativity
that
the
grading
system
has
stifled;
write
with
feeling
and
heart,
not
for
an
A.
But
seriously,
when
itOs
for
school,
write
for
the
A.
This
philosophy
carried
me
safely
through
the
early
years
of
my
serious
academic
writing,
and
into
high
school,
where
things
would
once
again
be
taken
to
the
next
level.
In
high
school,
the
main
purpose
of
writing
instruction
is
quite
simple,
and
is
outlined
from
the
very
beginning:
learn
how
to
write
at
a
college
level.
Of
course,
this
goal
leaves
a
high
school
freshman
with
some
real
questions,
Nwhat
the
heck
does
that
meanO,
Nare
we
talking
an
ivy
league
collegeO,
Oexactly
how
much
work
is
this
going
to
entail?.
Unfortunately,
these
questions
are
not
answered
as
much
with
words,
as
they
are
with
red
pen
and
perceived
insults.
Basically,
learning
to
write
at
a
college
level
means
that
the
work
that
you
are
currently
doing
is
at
once
pedantic
and
ill-informed,
too
simple
and
yet
simultaneously
over-complex,
illustrative
of
an
insufficient
vocabulary,
and
yet
bizarrely
verbose,
or
in
short,
just
plain
not
good
enough,
or
so
many
teachers
would
have
you
believe.
In
reality,
throughout
my
four
years
of
high
school,
I
never
received
a
satisfactory
answer
to
the
question
of
Nwhat
is
writing
at
a
college
levelO.
The
best
answer
I
could
come
up
with
is
that
writing
at
the
college
level
means
that
you
must
take
the
comments
your
teacher
puts
on
your
earliest
papers
i.e.,
Nimprove
dictionO,
Nanalyze
more
closelyO,
etc.
and
make
sure
you
apply
the
appropriate
changes
in
your
subsequent
work.
As
long
as
your
instructor
believes
that
your
writing
is
at
the
college
level,
it
is,
at
least
as
far
as
grading
is
concerned.
This
strategy
does
have
its
pitfalls,
namely
that
every
teacher
requires
different
things,
and
so
has
their
own
idea
of
what
college
writing
is.
This
normally
results
in
at
least
one
mediocre
grade
at
the
beginning
of
each
year,
until
what
the
teacher
desires
is
learned.
Eventually
however,
the
teacher
will
find
a
marked
improvement
in
your
writing,
that
is
once
it
conforms
completely
to
their
criteria.
One
may
argue
that
this
belief
is
not
helpful
in
many
real
life
situations,
but
I
must
argue
otherwise
by
giving
the
following
example:
In
my
junior
year,
I
received
what
until
that
point
had
been
the
greatest
academic
honor
of
my
life,
my
thesis
paper
on
Andersonville
prison
was
published
in
a
respected
academic
journal
subscribed
to
by
many
universities
and
libraries
across
the
country.
One
may
say,
given
that
the
panel
judging
these
essays
were
not
your
teachers,
and
thus
could
not
tell
you
what
they
wanted,
how
were
you
possibly
able
to
adapt
your
writing
to
their
desires?
The
answer
is
simple:
when
in
doubt,
just
give
your
writing
to
everybody.
Parents,
friends,
teachers,
siblings,
they
are
all
willing
to
tell
you
that
your
writing
is
not
up
to
snuff,
and
by
adopting
many
of
their
suggestions,
hopefully
you
will
find
a
healthy
balance
and
make
the
changes
that
the
ultimate
judge
of
your
work,
in
this
case
the
journalOs
review
panel,
would
have
had
you
make.
These
strategies,
developed
in
high
school,
and
in
reality
for
many
years
before
that,
ultimately
led
to
my
feeling
quite
prepared
to
begin
writing
in
college.
Ultimately,
Ncollege
writingO
just
meant
that
I
had
to
write
the
way
my
professors
wanted
me
to
write.
Of
course,
each
professor
was
looking
for
a
different
technique,
or
different
argumentative
styles
but
in
the
end
they
all
received
what
they
were
looking
for,
and
that
was
the
key
to
success.
I
have
in
reality
learned
many
things
about
the
technical
aspects
of
writing
over
the
years:
sentence
structure,
diction,
flow,
as
well
as
the
different
styles:
letters,
essays,
thesis
papers,
arguments,
even
a
few
legal
briefs,
but
in
the
end,
the
most
important
thing
I
have
learned
is
that
when
writing
for
school
or
work
or
wherever,
do
what
is
expected
of
you,
and
you
will
certainly
succeed.
Follow
directions,
take
suggestions,
donOt
fight
criticism
and
you
will
succeed.
However,
when
you
write
from
yourself,
for
yourself,
feel
free
to
let
the
lesson
go,
forget
everything
you
have
ever
been
taught,
flow
doesnOt
matter,
structure
doesnOt
matter,
diction
is
unimportant.
Write
from
the
heart,
and
write
for
yourself
and
what
comes
out
will
be
worthy
of
any
college,
and
more
important,
worthy
of
you.
