Returning
WA
Narrative
Fall
2010
In
the
past
year,
I
have
taken
two
upper-level
English
classes
due
to
my
curiosity
with
and
appreciation
of
poetry.
Though
the
subject
matter
of
both
classes
D
Modern
&
Contemporary
Poetry
and
Advanced
Creative
Writing
D
was
poetry,
these
courses
varied
vastly
in
their
scope
and
expectations.
Modern
&
Contemporary
poetry
was
primarily
a
class
concerned
with
literary
criticism
and
novel
research.
Oftentimes,
the
assignments
involved
comparing
and
contrasting
the
styles
of
two
poets
D
say,
a
modernist
and
a
contemporary
D
though
the
choice
as
to
whom
these
poets
were
was
often
open-ended.
Other
times,
we
were
asked
to
choose
a
single
poet
of
our
liking
and
generate
a
Nmini-thesisO
on
his
or
her
work
and
then
exploring
the
topic
through
research
and
our
own
interpretations
of
his
or
her
works.
One
of
the
most
valuable
things
I
learned
in
this
course
was
the
importance
of
having
your
writing
reviewed
by
an
objective
source.
In
this
course,
approximately
a
week
before
each
paper
was
to
be
due,
we
would
hold
a
peer
workshop
for
a
period
of
the
class.
Along
with
the
help
of
facilitative
questions,
the
peer
readers
would
scrutinize
and
constructively
criticize
each
otherOs
work,
looking
for
things
such
as
a
sufficiently
clear
and
narrow
focus
for
the
paper;
strengths
and
weaknesses;
adequate
development
of
major
points;
inclusion
of
specific
examples
to
support
our
claims;
and
several
other
elements
of
good
writing
Oftentimes,
the
writer
would
have
to
clear
up
the
peerOs
confusion
with
certain
parts
of
the
paper,
and
by
verbally
elucidating
the
writing
or
Ntalking
outO
the
paper,
the
writer
ultimately
realized
the
weaknesses
of
these
portions
and
was
able
to
correct
them.
Additionally,
the
peers
were
asked
to
be
active
readers
in
other
ways,
such
as
developing
counterclaims
that
were
perhaps
unconsidered
by
the
writer
or
making
suggestions
and
broaching
points
of
discussion
of
which
the
writer
had
not
previously
thought.
Ultimately,
this
allowed
the
writer
to
make
realizations
and
connections
that
might
have
otherwise
gone
unnoticed.
In
more
ways
than
one,
this
practice
of
peer
workshops
had
an
impact
on
my
work
as
a
writing
associate.
Much
of
our
work
as
WAs
is
asking
us
to
do
some
of
the
very
same
things
that
my
peers
and
I
did
in
our
Modern
&
Contemporary
Poetry
class.
It
is
important
as
a
WA
to
be
a
curious
and
analytical
reader,
asking
questions
when
something
is
not
sufficiently
clear
or
perhaps
when
there
is
an
instance
in
which
you
can
think
of
a
counterexample.
An
active,
involved
reader
in
turn
allows
for
the
student
writer
to
expand
the
purview
of
their
prose
by
recognizing
other
viewpoints,
as
well
as
his
or
her
audience.
I
found
that
whether
the
writing
I
was
reading
came
from
a
First
Year
Seminar
class
or
an
upper-level
English
class
dealing
with
the
literature
of
Milton,
there
were
similar
problems
across
the
spectrum
of
writers.
I
find
that
many
students
D
even
the
best
of
writers
D
sometimes
have
problems
presenting
their
ideas
in
a
logical
fashion.
Oftentimes,
writers
will
construct
a
sort
of
prose
that
makes
sense
to
them
and
perhaps
not
to
the
reader;
that
is,
they
will
write
Nwriter-centered
prose.O
This
sort
of
writing
arises
as
a
result
of
the
mindOs
complex
thought
processes
and
the
inability
to
effectively
transfer
these
thoughts
to
paper.
As
a
result,
what
makes
sense
to
the
writer
or
previously
made
sense
to
the
writer
at
the
time
of
its
transcription
sometimes
does
not
make
sense
to
the
reader
or
perhaps
no
longer
to
even
the
writer.
It
is
thus
through
analytical
questioning
on
the
part
of
the
peer
reader
or,
in
our
case,
the
WA,
that
the
writer
is
allowed
to
adjust
their
writing
to
a
more
Nreader-centered
proseO
and
more
clearly
delineate
the
flow
of
ideas
that
lead
to
a
conclusion
or
argument
and
take
into
better
account
his
or
her
audience.
Despite
the
ostensible
aversion
to
Nwriter-centered
proseO
expressed
above,
it
is
not
always
undesirable,
as
both
the
VaST
class
under
my
charge
in
the
spring
semester
and
the
Advanced
Creative
Writing
class
in
which
I
was
simultaneously
enrolled
taught
me.
In
fact,
there
is
quite
a
bit
to
be
said
for
Nwriter-centered
prose;O
while
at
times
it
can
be
unfavorable
(in
the
writing
of
an
expository
piece
or
literary
critique,
for
example),
Nwriter-centered
proseO
can
prove
to
be
valuable
in
other
forms
of
writing.
As
a
WA,
it
is
important
to
make
this
distinction,
which
often
involves
gaining
proper
knowledge
of
the
assignment
at
hand.
Whether
this
process
involves
talking
to
the
professor
and
taking
notes
on
the
upcoming
paper,
asking
the
professor
for
an
assignment
prompt
or
expectations
for
the
assignment,
or
asking
the
students
for
their
own
interpretation
of
the
assignment
as
it
was
given
to
them,
it
is
important.
This
is
a
particularly
important
process
in
determining
the
audience
for
which
you
or
the
student
is
supposed
to
write.
So
often,
the
wording
of
the
assignment
D
whether
verbal
or
written
D
reveals
the
intentions
of
the
professor
and
his
or
her
expectations
for
the
type
of
paper
to
be
written.
For
example,
the
assignment
prompt
that
reads
NWrite
an
organized
essay
in
which
you
compare
and
contrast
a
modernist
and
a
contemporary
poetO
requires
the
writer
to
attend
to
a
vastly
different
audience
than
a
prompt
that
reads
NConstruct
a
story
in
which
you
imagine
a
world
without
plastics,
how
this
came
to
be,
and
the
consequences
of
the
absence
of
plastics.O
It
is
obvious,
then,
that
these
two
assignments
D
one
of
which
is
from
Modern
&
Contemporary
Poetry
and
the
other
of
which
is
from
the
FYS
for
which
I
was
a
WA
D
require
of
the
writer
two
different
sorts
of
prose.
The
former
requires
the
writer
to
assume
that
the
audience
is
the
academic
world;
in
effect,
the
writer
is
becoming
a
part
of
academia,
and
thus
addresses
such
an
assignment
with
an
eye
toward
constructing
formal,
reader-based
prose
for
the
assumed
scholarly
audience.
The
latter,
on
the
other
hand,
is
much
less
stringent
in
terms
of
its
audience
and
expectations;
while
there
is
still
some
minimum
expectation
from
the
reader
for
continuity
and
logical
sequiturs,
this
sort
of
prose
can
be
much
more
Nwriter-basedO
in
that
is
more
acceptable
for
the
writer
to
force
the
reader
to
make
inferences,
conclusions,
and
assumptions
not
explicitly
sketched
out
by
the
writer.
It
is
important
as
a
WA
to
recognize
the
audience
for
a
particular
assignment,
and
I
find
that
this
is
a
good
starting
point
for
both
the
work
of
student
writers
under
my
aegis
and
my
own
writing.
In
the
past,
I
have
always
been
obstinate
in
my
efforts
to
remain
a
solitary
writer.
I
never
really
liked
the
idea
of
feedback
on
my
writing
apart
from
that
of
the
professor
in
the
form
of
a
grade
and
perhaps
a
cursory
comment
on
the
final
page
of
an
essay.
It
was
a
unique
experience
for
me
to
have
to
read
my
creative
work,
specifically
my
poetry,
in
front
of
a
class
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
others.
It
truly
gives
the
writer
a
sense
of
vulnerability
as
oneOs
creative
piece
is
put
on
a
chopping
block
for
an
entire
class
of
students
who
are
poets
in
their
own
right;
this
is
particularly
true
when,
like
me,
the
writer
or
poet
writes
out
of
a
sense
of
emotional
urgency
and
unfurls
line
by
line
personal
experiences,
thoughts,
and
feelings.
However,
in
recent
years,
particularly
in
the
two
semesters
in
which
I
took
Modern
&
Contemporary
Poetry
and
Advanced
Creative
Writing,
I
truly
learned
the
value
of
evaluative
feedback,
which
has
ha
d
a
profound
effect
on
me
as
both
a
WA
and
a
student
writer.
As
a
student
writer
myself,
I
know
what
kind
of
feedback
is
helpful,
and
this
knowledge
carries
into
my
WA
conferences
in
the
form
of
constructive
critiques
that
the
students
find
truly
useful.
The
form
of
the
writing
workshops
that
took
place
in
my
Advanced
Creative
Writing
class
provides
a
useful
template
and
starting
point
for
WA
conferences.
In
class,
the
fellow
student
writers
would
first
comment
on
strengths
and
pieces
of
the
work
that
they
truly
enjoyed/felt;
next,
they
would
comment
on
the
weaknesses
and
areas
in
which
the
writing
could
be
improved;
finally,
the
writer
would
be
allowed
to
ask
the
class
questions
about
specific
parts
of
a
piece
about
which
they
were
unsure.
As
one
can
see,
this
workshop
can
easily
be
adjusted
and
downsized
for
a
one-on-one
WA
conference,
with
the
WA
taking
the
place
of
the
class
and
the
student
writer
from
an
FYS
or
VaST
taking
the
place
of
the
poet
on
the
chopping
block.
In
my
opinion,
the
template
requires
some
tweaking
to
its
basic
structure,
with
the
WA
first
asking
the
student
if
he
or
she
has
any
questions,
as
I
think
it
is
best
to
allow
the
student
writer
to
set
the
agenda
for
a
WA
conference.
If
the
student
writer
would
like
to
discuss
the
organization
of
his
or
her
paper,
then
that
desire
should
guide
the
conference;
and
if
the
student
writer
(perhaps
an
international
student)
would
like
help
with
grammar
and
English
idiom,
then
so
be
it.
In
addition
to
this
modification
to
this
basic
template,
one
further
change
can
be
made.
Whereas
in
the
writing
workshops
of
my
poetry
class
the
fellow
writers
were
the
ones
doing
all
of
the
critiquing,
in
a
WA
conference,
it
is
necessary
for
the
WA
to
place
some
of
that
onus
on
the
student
writer
himself.
That
is,
it
is
not
entirely
the
WAOs
function
to
emphasize
the
positives
and
negatives
of
a
student
writerOs
paper;
rather,
it
is
also
his
or
her
function
to
ask
the
sorts
of
questions
that
will
force
the
student
writer
to
think
about
his
or
her
own
writing
and
learn
to
identify
the
strong
points
and
weaknesses
within.
It
is
only
through
this
process
of
becoming
a
self-aware
writer
that
the
student
can
rightly
become
a
better
writer.
While
evaluative
feedback
from
peers
can
be
invaluable,
it
is
in
large
part
our
job
as
WAs
to
serve
as
the
living,
breathing
version
of
the
previously
mentioned
sheet
of
Nfacilitative
questionsO
and
to
teach
the
students
to
be
the
same
in
their
own
process
writing.
Though
poetry
is
certainly
more
subjective
than
the
average
assignment
given
to
an
FYS
or
VaST,
the
same
basic
principles
of
process
writing
can
be
applied
across
the
spectrum.
I
have
learned
through
the
course
of
these
past
two
semesters,
both
in
my
classes
and
in
my
conferences
with
student
writers,
that
one
of
the
most
beneficial
things
one
can
do
as
a
writer
and
as
a
WA
is
read
the
work
of
others.
Sometimes,
in
my
recent
writing
courses,
I
found
it
equally
beneficial
to
hear
the
work
of
others
(as
in
the
readings
we
did
in
Advanced
Creative
Writing)
and
to
read
the
work
of
others
(as
in
the
peer
workshops
of
Modern
&
Contemporary
Poetry)
as
it
was
to
have
my
work
critiqued
by
my
peers.
So
often
in
M&C
did
I
end
up
coming
to
class
with
five
pages
of
rambling
discourse
on
some
poet
or
other
that
faintly
resembled
the
finished
ten-page
product
to
be
handed
in
the
following
week.
Much
of
my
problem
with
the
initial
composition
of
such
a
paper
was
a
lack
of
clear
direction
and
cogent
argument,
and
it
was
only
after
switching
my
paper
with
a
fellow
classmateOs
and
perusing
their
work
in
an
effort
to
help
him
or
her
improve
it
that
my
own
task
became
more
apparent.
Even
hearing
othersO
work
in
Advanced
Creative
Writing
gave
me
something
to
aspire
to,
whether
it
be
the
beautiful
way
in
which
they
rendered
an
image
through
words,
their
use
of
powerful,
highly
effective
allusions,
or
the
intangible,
visceral
experience
provided
by
their
poetry.
As
a
WA,
I
think
it
is
equally
important
to
take
careful
note
of
the
work
of
oneOs
student
writers.
In
more
than
a
few
of
my
WA
conferences
this
past
year,
I
have
relied
on
the
students
to
help
me
in
guiding
their
classmates.
For
example,
professors
sometimes
give
assignment
prompts
that
are
rather
ambiguous;
when
this
is
the
case,
I
ask
the
students
for
how
their
interpretation
of
the
assignment
as
it
was
given
to
them,
whether
verbally
or
in
writing.
I
usually
do
my
best
to
develop
my
own
interpretation
of
the
assignment,
though
when
even
I
fail
at
allaying
any
of
the
ambiguity,
I
turn
to
the
students
for
help.
Though
this
technique
is
not
as
valuable
for
those
students
who
have
signed
up
for
the
first
few
conferences,
it
is
certainly
invaluable
for
those
that
come
later
on
the
docket.
After
just
a
few
rounds
of
conferences,
I
can
begin
to
sense
through
patterns
in
the
writing
of
the
students
the
intentions
of
the
professor
in
issuing
such
an
assignment
and
make
suggestions
accordingly.
However,
there
is
more
to
learn
from
the
students
than
just
the
basic
purpose
of
the
assignment.
In
addition,
as
a
WA,
I
can
learn
from
the
student
writers
ways
in
which
to
help
their
fellow
classmates.
If,
for
example,
I
see
one
student
writer
using
several
specific
examples
and
quotes
from
outside
sources,
I
will
ask
him
or
her
about
what
spurred
them
to
do
so;
if
he
or
she
replies
that
the
professor
asked
them
to
include
five
outside
sources
in
the
paper,
then
I
can
pass
this
information
along
to
other
classmates
and
make
sure
their
papers
fulfill
such
requirements.
Additionally,
after
reading
several
rounds
of
papers
on
the
same
topic,
I
can
begin
to
make
suggestions
to
other
student
writers
about
where
they
might
find
outside
sources
or
suggest
class
materials
that
might
lead
them
in
the
right
direction.
This
process
of
gleaning
information
from
student
writers
can
be
used
in
myriad
ways
to
improve
your
conferences
with
upcoming
students.
I
feel
that
apart
from
being
a
student
writer
myself,
as
a
WA
I
find
that
I
draw
on
an
authority
that
is
given
to
me
by
the
students
themselves;
that
is,
after
reading
so
many
papers
on
similar
or
selfsame
topics,
I
often
feel
that
I
have
sufficient
knowledge
on
the
topic
(often
including
specific
facts
and
figures
committed
to
memory
from
seeing
them
multiple
times
in
studentsO
writings)
that
I
myself
could
write
a
paper
that
would
fulfill
the
requirements
of
the
assignment.
It
is
the
confluence
of
this
knowledge
and
the
many
lessons
I
have
learned
through
my
many
experiences
as
a
student
writer
that
allow
me
to
be
an
effective
writing
associate.
