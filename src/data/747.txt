Narrative
I
do
not
recall
when
I
first
started
writing.
It
seems
to
be
a
skill
that
I
acquired
sometime
during
my
childhood
just
like
speaking,
drawing,
or
coloring.
But
I
do
remember
that
my
journey
as
a
writer
was
not
steady.
There
were
ups
and
downs,
loops
and
turns,
and
broken
paths
that
I
had
to
walk
through
in
order
to
become
the
writer
that
I
am
today.
My
earliest
memory
of
anything
related
to
writing
is
from
my
time
in
Bangladesh.
I
remember
being
surrounded
by
my
older
cousins
who
would
stay
up
late
at
night,
writing
by
candlelight,
because
there
was
no
electricity.
They
would
write
very
neatly
and
carefully
because
if
there
were
any
errors
they
could
easily
get
swats
from
the
teacher
who
walked
around
with
a
long
stick
to
ensure
that
children
behaved
and
did
their
work
properly.
I
recall
watching
apprehensively
one
day
as
a
teacher
asked
one
of
my
classmates
to
stand
up
and
hold
his
hands
out
in
front
of
him.
The
teacher
struck
him
several
times
and
by
the
time
the
child
sat
down
his
hands
were
crimson.
I
promised
myself
then
that
I
would
take
particular
care
in
doing
all
of
my
work
so
that
I
would
never
be
in
that
position.
Thankfully,
I
did
not
live
in
Bangladesh
for
long.
When
my
family
moved
to
America
I
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
teachers
here
did
not
hit
their
students;
even
if
you
didn't
complete
your
homework,
the
teacher
would
not
lay
a
hand
on
you.
Clearly,
the
education
system
in
America
was
less
extreme
than
it
was
in
Bangladesh.
When
I
returned
to
visit
Bangladesh
a
few
summers
later,
my
uncle
asked
me
to
write
something.
NWhat
should
I
write?O
I
asked.
NAnything,O
he
replied.
Wondering
what
he
was
up
to,
I
wrote
My
name
is
and
I
like
to
read
fiction
on
the
paper
he
gave
me.
Without
glancing
at
a
single
word
that
I
had
written,
he
first
commented
on
my
pen-holding
style.
NWhy
are
you
holding
your
pen
like
that?O
he
asked.
NThis
is
how
you
are
suppose
to
hold
it,O
he
continued,
taking
the
pen
from
me
and
sliding
it
between
his
fingers.
I
was
baffled;
unsure
of
how
to
reply.
I
always
thought
that
people
were
allowed
to
hold
their
writing
utensils
however
they
chose,
but
here
was
my
uncle
informing
me
that
there
was
only
one
correct
way
to
hold
a
pen.
He
then
took
a
look
at
my
writing
and
exclaimed,
Nwhat
is
this?
It
looks
like
chicken
scratch.
I
bet
if
you
held
your
pen
properly,
your
handwriting
will
improve
greatly.O
I
stared
at
my
paper,
looking
over
the
scribbles
that
I
had
made.
Was
it
really
that
bad?
I
wondered.
If
my
writing
didn't
look
good
on
paper,
would
anyone
want
to
read
it?
When
I
returned
to
America,
I
started
holding
my
pencil
the
way
my
uncle
had
showed
me,
taking
great
care
when
writing
so
that
everything
was
nice
and
neat.
My
stride
to
perfection
actually
made
my
writing
speed
much
slower
and
my
teachers
soon
took
notice.
NWhy
are
you
writing
so
slowly?O
Ms.
Lasner,
my
third
grade
teacher,
asked.
NI
changed
the
way
I
hold
my
pencil
so
I
can
write
neater,O
I
replied.
She
paused
for
a
minute
then
said,
NHoney,
there
is
no
right
way
to
hold
a
pencil.
Just
hold
it
they
way
you
normally
do
and
a
little
practice
will
make
your
writing
neater.O
I
wanted
to
protest
but
she
pointed
to
several
of
my
classmates
and
said,
NSee
how
everyone
holds
their
pencils
differently?
That
doesn't
make
their
writing
less
neat.
It's
about
how
much
practice
you've
had.
As
you
get
older,
your
handwriting
will
improve.O
I
looked
at
all
my
classmates
holding
their
pencils
in
various
ways.
I
guess
my
uncle
was
wrong
after
all,
I
thought
to
myself.
As
the
years
passed,
my
handwriting
improved
greatly,
as
did
the
content
of
my
writing.
I
suspect
it
was
due
to
all
the
books
that
I
read.
My
mother
would
often
yell
at
me
because
I
would
be
sitting
on
my
bed
reading
a
book
all
day
instead
of
doing
my
chores.
But
no
matter
what
she
said
I
continued
to
get
books
from
the
library
and
delve
into
the
stories
of
great
authors.
My
motivation
to
read
was
derived
from
a
valuable
token
of
advice
that
a
teacher
had
once
given
me:
to
be
a
good
writer
you
have
to
first
read
great
books.
I
knew
that
I
wanted
to
become
a
good
writer,
so
I
took
her
advice
to
heart
and
read
widely;
from
fiction
and
fantasy,
to
history
and
science,
I
read
as
much
and
as
often
as
I
could.
This
paved
the
way
for
my
own
writing
style
and
I
continued
to
improve
as
a
writer
throughout
the
years.
It
wasn't
long
however,
before
I
started
questioning
my
writing
once
again.
The
summer
after
I
completed
ninth
grade,
I
applied
to
take
two
college
courses
at
Syracuse
University.
In
one
course
called
Media
Literacy,
we
would
watch
a
film
every
week
and
write
a
one-page
critique
using
the
terms
and
concepts
that
we
had
learned
about
in
class.
After
working
hard
to
write
my
first
film
critique,
I
eagerly
awaited
for
my
professor
to
hand
me
back
my
graded
paper.
When
I
received
it,
I
stared
shockingly
at
the
letter
D
written
in
red
pen
at
the
top
of
the
page.
There
was
a
sea
of
red
marks
scattered
throughout
and
I
could
not
help
but
wonder
whether
I
had
someone
else's
paper.
I
looked
at
the
left
hand
corner
and
sure
enough
there
was
my
name.
To
think
that
I
had
spend
hours
writing
this
only
to
receive
a
D
was
gut-wrenching.
What
had
I
done
wrong?
What
was
I
missing?
I
skimmed
over
the
notes
my
professor
had
written
and
went
to
her
for
more
feedback.
She
looked
my
paper
and
said,
NYou
had
some
really
good
ideas
but
your
thesis
statement
is
not
clear.
It's
hard
to
tell
where
you're
going
with
this.
Maybe
you
should
write
a
draft
next
time
and
take
it
to
the
writing
center.
They
have
writing
assistants
who
can
proof
read
it
for
you
and
give
you
some
helpful
tips.O
I
was
crushed;
I
could
not
have
fathomed
that
all
the
effort
I
had
put
into
writing
the
film
critique
had
resulted
in
this,
moreover,
I
felt
like
I
was
being
criticized
for
not
knowing
how
to
write
well.
I
decided
then
that
I
would
seek
out
the
help
necessary
in
order
to
improve
my
writing
skills.
The
amount
of
writing
that
I
had
done
in
high
school
would
not
assist
me
now
that
I
was
taking
a
college
course.
After
we
watched
the
second
film,
I
wrote
my
first
draft
and
went
to
the
writing
center
for
feedback.
The
writing
assistant
took
a
few
minutes
to
read
over
my
essay
then
gave
it
back
to
me.
She
asked
me
if
I
could
underline
my
thesis
statement.
I
took
my
pen
and
underlined
what
I
thought
was
my
thesis
and
handed
the
paper
back
to
her.
She
said,
NGood,
now
I
want
you
to
go
though
each
paragraph
and
tell
me
if
it
helps
build
your
argument.O
NOkayO
I
said.
I
read
my
first
paragraph
and
thought
that
it
made
some
good
points
that
supported
my
thesis.
However
when
I
got
to
my
third
and
fourth
paragraphs,
I
realized
that
I
was
going
off
topic
and
that
I
did
not
manage
to
prove
my
thesis
by
the
end
of
the
essay.
So
this
must
be
what
the
professor
meant
when
she
said
its
hard
to
tell
where
you're
going
with
this,
I
thought
to
myself.
NHow
do
you
think
you
can
improve
the
essay?O
the
WA
asked.
NI
need
to
continue
building
my
argument
throughout
the
paper,
not
just
in
the
first
and
second
paragraphs,O
I
replied.
NExactly,O
she
said,
Nsometimes
you
just
need
a
second
set
of
eyes
to
read
your
writing
and
ask
questions;
then
you
can
figure
out
what
you
need
to
improve.O
I
sat
there
thinking
about
what
she
said.
Next
time
I
will
re-read
my
essay
several
times
and
make
sure
I
prove
my
thesis,
I
thought
to
myself.
When
I
edited
and
revised
my
second
film
critique
it
was
in
much
better
shape
than
the
first
one
I
had
written.
The
grade
I
received
for
the
second
one
also
improved
dramatically
from
the
D
that
I
had
received
the
week
prior.
I
was
proud
of
myself
for
the
work
that
I
had
done.
Returning
to
high
school
in
September,
I
went
with
the
full
realization
that
my
teachers
did
not
adequately
prepare
me
for
college
level
writing.
The
few
essays
that
I
wrote
in
English
class
were
not
very
demanding
and
I
knew
that
many
of
my
fellow
classmates
would
struggle
just
like
I
did
when
they
went
to
college.
That
is
why
I
sought
out
a
program
called
the
College
Readiness
Program,
CRP
for
short.
It
provided
high
school
students
with
SAT
prep
as
well
as
essay
writing
tips
and
techniques.
They
assisted
seniors
with
their
college
applications
and
prepared
them
for
college
level
writing.
On
my
first
day
at
CRP
I
met
a
tall
man
dressed
in
black
jeans
and
a
t-shirt.
He
had
large
brown
afro
on
his
head
and
his
name
was
Peter
Wilson;
he
was
the
director
of
the
College
Readiness
Program.
Skeptical
that
I
would
get
much
out
of
the
program,
I
attended
the
first
session
and
listened
to
Peter
speak.
NWriting
is
a
process,O
he
stated.
NEvery
single
student
that
has
been
in
this
program
has
had
to
write
7,
8,
and
sometimes
even
9
drafts
to
get
their
personal
statements
ready
for
college.
So
don't
think
that
its
an
easy
process;
it
takes
time,
dedication,
and
a
lot
of
hard
work.O
He
then
proceeded
to
read
a
sample
essay
that
a
student
had
written
over
year
ago
for
her
application
to
New
York
University.
I
listened
intently
as
Peter
read
about
a
high
school
teenager's
realization
that
she
was
at
the
cornerstone
of
becoming
an
adult.
By
simply
describing
how
her
mother
stopped
doing
little
things
for
her
like
walking
her
to
school,
making
her
lunch,
and
checking
her
homework,
the
reader
could
infer
that
she
was
ambivalent
about
growing
up.
I
felt
like
I
was
being
pulled
into
the
story,
experiencing
all
of
the
emotions
the
teenager
had.
After
Peter
had
finished
reading
there
was
an
air
of
silence;
everyone
needed
time
to
soak
in
what
they
had
just
heard.
NThis,O
Peter
said,
Nis
what
good
writing
sounds
like
and
it's
the
result
of
many
hours
of
drafting,
editing,
and
rewriting.O
Listening
to
the
essay,
I
was
motivated
to
improve
my
writing
skills
so
that
my
writing
could
be
just
as
captivating
and
awe-inspiring.
I
worked
with
Peter
to
write
my
own
personal
narratives.
He
first
had
me
write
down
three
different
paragraphs
of
instances
in
my
life
that
were
memorable
or
noteworthy.
Then
he
read
each
of
them
and
told
me
to
continue
writing
the
one
that
seemed
the
most
interesting.
I
continued
to
write
about
a
time
when
I
had
witnessed
a
man
beating
his
wife
in
Bangladesh
and
what
it
taught
me
about
the
value
of
women
in
different
societies.
I
gave
my
first
draft
to
Peter
and
nervously
bit
my
lip,
wondering
how
he
would
respond.
He
sat
quietly
and
read
my
narrative.
Then
he
circled
a
few
things,
added
some
question
marks,
and
finally
looked
up
from
the
paper.
He
said,
NThis
example
you
used
is
great.
I
think
we
have
a
diamond
in
the
rough.
It
needs
more
polishing
though.
Read
over
the
places
where
I
added
question
marks
-
that
means
you're
not
being
clear.
And
everything
that
I
circled
and
added
a
star
next
to
needs
more
details.
Elaborate
using
the
five
senses.O
NOkay,O
I
said.
I
was
glad
that
he
liked
my
topic,
now
all
I
needed
to
do
was
revise
and
edit.
However
my
second
draft
was
not
up
to
par
with
what
Peter
expected
either,
so
he
sent
me
back
for
more
revisions.
I
was
a
little
annoyed
at
first
because
I
thought
he
was
nitpicking,
but
I
kept
reminding
myself
of
what
the
WA
in
Syracuse
University
had
said
to
me:
a
second
set
of
eyes
can
help
make
finding
the
problem
easier.
It
took
me
five
revisions
before
Peter
approved
of
the
material
that
I
had
written.
When
he
finally
said,
NYes,
this
is
it,O
I
felt
like
jumping
for
joy.
I
used
my
personal
narrative
to
apply
to
several
scholarships
and
I
luckily
I
was
awarded
two
of
them.
Working
hard
to
write
many
essays
in
the
College
Readiness
Program
helped
me
improve
my
writing
skills
immensely.
When
I
started
writing
papers
at
Lafayette
College
I
found
that
it
was
much
easier
for
me
to
write
than
when
I
first
started
out
in
Syracuse.
I
made
sure
to
make
outlines
with
clear
thesis
statements
before
I
started
writing.
And
after
writing
I
would
make
several
revisions
and
edits.
I
also
utilized
the
Writing
Center
at
Lafayette
several
times
because
I
knew
that
having
someone
else
read
my
papers
and
talk
me
through
them
helped
me
organize
my
thoughts.
Although
my
journey
as
a
writer
has
not
been
easy,
I
am
glad
that
I
went
through
the
struggles
and
challenges
that
I
did
because
I
would
not
be
the
writer
I
am
today
if
I
had
not
walked
through
those
broken
paths.
