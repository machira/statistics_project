Returning
WA
Essay
My
Writing
History
throughout
the
Past
Year
During
my
junior
year,
I
took
many
writing
intensive
classes.
All
of
the
writing
assignments
were
beneficial
in
their
own
ways,
but
I
especially
learned
a
great
deal
about
my
own
writing
from
the
portfolios
I
compiled
in
my
Modern
British
Novel
English
class.
The
writing
assignments
required
me
to
expand
the
conventions
that
I
previously
held
to
dictate
my
writing
style,
and
I
was
able
to
greatly
develop
other
approaches
to
my
writing.
Throughout
the
course
of
the
class,
we
read
five
novels,
each
with
a
very
distinctive
writing
style.
Upon
further
examination
of
the
key
elements
and
trademarks
of
each
author,
our
class
found
the
similarities
and
differences
between
each
one.
After
identifying
specific
characteristics
that
signified
each
author,
we
were
assigned
to
write
in
the
style
and
language
of
the
author
of
whichever
book
we
were
reading
at
the
time.
Many
students
in
the
class,
myself
included,
initially
thought
that
it
would
not
be
that
difficult
to
write
these
imitations,
since
we
already
had
the
guidelines
and
examples
previously
established
by
the
original
authors.
However,
once
I
began
writing,
I
quickly
realized
that
writing
in
the
tone
and
voice
of
an
author
is
much
more
difficult
than
I
had
thought
it
would
be.
I
had
to
find
a
fine
balance
between
writing
something
of
my
own
and
just
using
the
conventions
of
the
author,
as
opposed
to
simply
rewriting
the
pre-existing
words
of
the
author.
Logistically,
we
were
also
restrained
by
a
page
limit,
so
we
had
to
be
able
to
express
the
authorOs
style
immediately
and
clearly
D
there
was
no
allowance
for
easing
our
way
into
the
authorOs
voice.
From
the
very
first
word,
we
had
to
write
thinking
within
the
mind
frame
of
the
author
so
that
we
could
obviously
convey
which
traits
we
were
replicating
in
our
work.
While
it
took
me
a
while
to
acclimate
to
each
authorOs
unique
style,
I
was
eventually
able
to
pick
out
which
authorial
traits
I
wanted
to
imitate
in
my
own
writing.
After
much
experimentation
and
countless
rewrites,
our
class
met
for
a
peer
editing
workshop
to
exchange
our
work-in-progress
portfolios,
which
included
not
only
our
imitation
drafts
of
other
authorsO
work,
but
also
an
explanatory
essay
that
described
what
we
learned
about
each
authorOs
writing
style
and
why
we
chose
to
write
in
the
manner
that
we
did.
For
the
workshop,
I
was
actually
fortunate
enough
to
be
paired
with
another
writing
associate
during
our
peer
editing
session,
so
we
were
both
able
to
use
skills
weOve
learned
as
WAs.
Because
we
both
have
had
hours
of
experience
working
with
other
students
and
their
writing,
we
were
able
to
have
a
very
open
and
honest
discussion
about
our
work
without
having
to
worry
about
the
restricting
formality
that
sometimes
accompanies
conferences
when
people
do
not
know
each
other
or
are
not
used
to
the
format
of
peer
editing
meetings.
We
were
able
to
cut
right
to
the
chase
and
focus
on
the
stylistic
approaches
and
word
choices
in
accordance
to
how
they
fit
the
assignment
and
our
own
creative
choices.
We
also
did
not
hesitate
to
ask
each
other
questions
about
how
to
strengthen
our
writing
and
were
able
to
give
answers
to
each
other
freely
and
openly.
Once
I
found
my
own
rhythm
of
writing
within
each
authorOs
style,
I
had
a
lot
of
fun
trying
to
get
my
writing
as
close
as
possible
to
the
style
of
each
individual
author.
I
enjoyed
infusing
my
work
with
a
bit
of
each
author,
carrying
my
stories
down
paths
I
would
not
have
thought
of
without
guidance
from
the
precedents
set
by
the
authors.
The
more
I
wrote,
the
more
comfortable
I
got
writing
within
the
conventions
set
by
completely
different
people,
spanning
the
greatly
contrasting
time
periods
within
the
past
century.
It
was
incredibly
interesting
to
see
how
some
aspects
of
writing
have
not
changed
in
the
past
one
hundred
years
and
that
authors
sometimes
use
the
same
techniques
to
convey
information
about
their
characters
and
plots.
For
example,
early
twentieth
century
writer
E.M.
Forster
often
interjects
bits
and
passages
of
dialogue
within
his
descriptions
of
the
scenes,
expressing
the
delicate
interaction
between
characters.
Almost
a
full
century
later,
Zadie
Smith
also
intersperses
meaningful
yet
concise
dialogue
throughout
her
novel
to
convey
character
traits
and
situations
crucial
to
the
meaning
of
her
work.
This
is
just
one
example
of
the
many
authorial
characteristics
we
had
to
pay
attention
to
while
creating
our
own
imitations
of
writing.
Further
along
in
the
semester,
we
once
again
exchanged
papers
with
other
students.
This
time,
instead
of
working
with
a
WA,
I
was
paired
with
a
young
man
who
did
not
really
care
about
his
writing.
After
we
read
each
otherOs
papers,
he
didnOt
want
to
talk
about
them
and
just
wanted
us
to
give
back
our
respective
papers.
When
I
tried
to
talk
to
the
student
about
style
and
clearly
conveying
an
argument
through
my
paper,
he
simply
told
me
that
NeverythingO
was
NgoodO,
and
the
paper
was
NfineO.
I
then
tried
to
ask
him
a
few
questions
about
how
he
went
about
his
own
writing,
and
that
seemed
to
open
up
the
conversation
a
bit.
However,
it
was
still
drastically
different
from
the
earlier
conference
I
had
had
with
a
fellow
WA.
These
peer
editing
workshops
throughout
the
semester
really
made
me
focus
on
my
own
personal
revision
process.
I
started
finishing
my
drafts
earlier
and
earlier
so
that
I
would
have
more
time
between
each
reading
of
my
draft.
I
also
set
up
a
sort
of
informal
set
of
drop-in
hours
with
the
other
WA
in
this
particular
class,
and
weOd
met
in
between
our
class
and
WA
staff
meeting
to
read
each
otherOs
papers
and
discuss
writing
assignments
for
the
class.
I
developed
many
positive
writing
habits
from
taking
this
class,
and
hopefully
they
will
carry
through
to
my
classes
next
semester,
even
if
I
donOt
have
scheduled
in-class
writing
workshops
or
other
WAs
in
my
classes.
In
terms
of
my
experiences
as
a
writing
associate
this
past
year,
I
had
a
year
that
was
unlike
anything
I
could
have
expected.
Last
fall,
I
was
assigned
to
work
with
the
FYS
Japanese
Art:
Shifting
Perspectives
Throughout
the
Western
World.
When
I
first
met
the
students,
I
quickly
learned
that
even
though
the
class
focused
on
Japanese
artwork
and
history,
most
of
the
students
were
science
majors
who
had
no
interest
in
art
whatsoever.
Also,
out
of
a
sixteen
person
class,
only
about
three
or
four
of
the
students
had
actually
chosen
this
FYS
as
their
first
choice.
This
made
for
an
interesting
attitude
from
the
students,
given
that
most
of
them
were
not
very
excited
to
be
in
the
class.
Once
I
started
meeting
with
the
professor,
she
gave
me
an
overview
of
the
assignments
for
the
entire
semester
and
her
hopes
and
expectations
for
how
she
wanted
the
students
to
progress
and
advance
in
her
writing.
She
explained
her
methods
for
commenting
on
papers,
opting
to
Ncover
the
studentsO
papers
with
writingO
to
point
out
their
strengths
and
weaknesses
in
each
part
of
their
writing.
She
also
warned
me
that
students
might
see
red
ink
all
over
the
pages
and
get
worried;
in
response,
she
wanted
me
to
reassure
them
that
her
comments
were
constructive
criticism
designed
to
help
improve
their
writing,
not
negative
statements
with
the
intent
to
lower
their
grades.
The
first
semester
went
so
well
with
this
professor
that
she
asked
if
I
could
work
with
her
again
in
the
spring
for
her
VAST
class
D
an
offer
I
gladly
accepted.
When
the
professor
requested
I
work
with
her
again,
she
told
me
that
she
taught
the
same
FYS
class
as
a
VAST
D
little
did
I
know,
it
was
exactly
the
same
class
both
semesters,
just
with
a
different
age
group
of
students.
Instead
of
anxious,
sometimes
nervous
freshmen
in
their
first
semesters
of
college,
I
found
myself
working
with
more
confident
sophomores
and
even
a
few
juniors
in
their
fourth
or
sixth
semesters
as
college
students.
This
difference,
however,
did
not
alter
the
way
the
professor
went
about
teaching
the
class.
She
still
assigned
the
same
exact
assignments,
word
for
word,
and
used
the
same
set
of
notes
to
teach
the
class
that
she
had
used
in
the
fall.
This
provided
me
with
a
control
to
see
how
the
students
reacted
to
her
teaching
style
and
comments
on
their
writing,
for
she
made
no
distinction
(at
least,
none
that
was
apparent
to
me)
between
how
she
handled
her
commenting
style
on
the
freshmenOs
versus
upperclassmenOs
papers.
This
approach
of
the
professor
writing
all
over
the
studentsO
papers
made
me
examine
how
my
own
professors
handle
comments
on
papers
I
write
for
them.
I
realized
that
IOve
had
a
wide
range
of
reactions
from
my
professors,
but
never
one
that
wrote
as
much
all
over
the
paper
as
the
professor
I
was
a
WA
for.
IOve
found
it
extremely
difficult
when
professors
have
not
written
any
comments
at
all,
and
simply
put
a
grade
at
the
end
of
the
paper.
Without
any
feedback,
there
was
no
way
for
me
to
know
what
my
strengths
and
weaknesses
were
within
the
paper,
and
I
therefore
could
not
know
how
to
improve
my
writing.
As
I
thought
about
the
commenting
style
I
best
responded
too,
I
realized
that
I
work
well
when
professors
make
short
comments
throughout
the
paper
and
then
write
a
more
detailed
description
of
what
they
thought
at
the
end
of
the
entire
assignment.
This
helps
me
understand
how
my
entire
body
of
work
is
being
conveyed,
and
it
lets
me
know
if
the
reader
got
the
point
or
argument
of
my
whole
paper.
However,
the
comments
within
the
pages
are
also
extremely
helpful
because
they
are
not
overwhelming,
rather
they
point
out
strengths
and
weaknesses
within
my
sentences,
paragraphs,
and
overall
argument.
After
thinking
about
my
own
experiences
with
professorOs
commenting
styles,
I
began
to
think
about
how
the
studentsO
in
the
class
I
was
the
WA
for
reacted
to
their
professorOs
extremely
Nhands-onO
approach
to
written
feedback.
Initially,
after
the
first
round
of
papers,
the
students
all
had
the
same
reactions
of
worry
and
concern
about
why
the
professor
had
written
so
much
on
their
papers.
From
what
I
gathered
from
both
semesters
of
students,
the
professor
wrote
more
on
their
papers
than
she
had
ever
commented
about
in
class,
especially
in
regards
to
the
nature
and
purpose
of
the
assignment.
Many
students
did
not
understand
how
the
assignments
related
to
what
they
were
learning
in
class,
and
the
professor
simply
handed
out
the
assignments
without
discussing
them.
This
left
some
students
floundering
for
where
to
start
with
their
writing
and
we
spent
much
of
our
conference
time
talking
about
what
their
papers
hoped
to
accomplish.
Because
the
students
were
surprised
and
initially
worried
about
the
large
amount
of
comments
from
their
professor,
it
made
me
think
about
and
reconsider
my
own
habits
and
commenting
style
when
I
read
studentsO
papers.
During
my
first
year
as
a
WA,
I
always
made
sure
to
comment
on
not
only
areas
of
concern
but
also
strengths
and
good
points
of
the
paper.
I
feel
that
it
is
important
for
students
to
not
think
that
as
WAOs,
weOre
simply
there
to
point
out
all
the
things
NwrongO
with
their
papers;
our
conferences
are
meant
to
help
improve
their
entire
writing
process
and
help
students
feel
more
comfortable
with
writing.
In
turn,
this
requires
students
to
know
what
writing
strengths
they
already
have,
and
they
canOt
know
how
to
alter
their
writing
process
if
they
donOt
know
what
already
works
for
them.
Aside
from
providing
a
full
range
of
comments,
I
realized
that
I
tend
to
imitate
the
style
of
commenting
that
works
best
for
me
D
I
make
a
few
comments
throughout
the
body
of
the
paper,
then
if
there
are
any
larger
concerns
or
points,
IOll
make
a
few
notes
or
sentences
at
the
end
of
the
entire
paper.
I
donOt
write
that
much
throughout
the
paper
because
I
donOt
want
students
to
focus
only
on
my
written
comments;
rather,
conferences
are
far
more
successful
when
students
participate
and
lead
the
discussion,
coming
up
with
their
own
ideas
about
how
to
revise
and
edit
their
papers.
Throughout
the
past
two
years,
IOve
found
that
many
students,
especially
freshmen
and
those
who
are
meeting
their
WA
for
the
first
time
each
semester,
are
extremely
concerned
with
what
WAOs
have
written
on
their
papers
and
simply
see
comments
as
corrections.
I
try
to
help
students
participate
in
conversation
more
by
not
supplying
them
with
endless
comments
from
me;
rather,
I
place
a
pen
in
front
of
them
so
they
can
write
their
own
thoughts
down
as
our
conference
progresses.
Students
seem
to
respond
to
this
method,
and
it
causes
them
to
not
only
think
of
their
own
revisions,
but
keep
asking
further
questions
as
well.
Overall,
I
try
to
find
a
balance
between
giving
students
enough
feedback
and
not
overwhelming
them
with
my
own
ideas
about
their
papers.
This
is
the
most
successful
method
I
have
found
in
my
past
two
years
as
a
WA,
and
it
took
a
while
to
reach
this
medium
of
commenting
on
studentsO
papers.
However,
even
though
it
has
worked
for
me
and
my
students
in
the
past,
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
it
will
work
this
year.
Even
though
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
working
with
one
professor
last
year,
I
am
excited
to
work
with
a
new
class
this
fall.
