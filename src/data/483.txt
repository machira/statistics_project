Fall
Returning
WA
Assignment
Professor
Falbo
08/15/05
At
the
conclusion
of
this
assignment
last
year,
I
ended
with
a
desire
to
explore
a
variety
of
genres
of
writing
to
further
develop
my
writing
style.
To
my
surprise,
this
past
year
has
offered
me
much
more
than
I
bargained
for
in
the
number
of
ways
I
was
challenged
to
write
and
in
the
variety
of
assignments
I
had
the
privilege
of
being
a
WA.
Along
with
these
myriad
of
experiences,
I
also
had
the
opportunity
to
work
closely
with
other
WAOs
in
various
interactions
which
invariably
led
to
me
alter
my
techniques
as
a
WA.
However,
despite
having
these
definitive
experiences
I
remain
convinced
that
the
peer
review
learning
process
is
one
that
never
ends.
My
year
began
with
a
WA
assignment
to
a
freshman
year
class
and
my
being
enrolled
in
a
writing
class,
Research
Methods,
both
of
which
placed
significant
priority
on
meeting
with
the
WA.
Hence
I
found
myself
in
the
fortunate
situation
where
the
obligations
I
placed
upon
my
WA
students
as
far
as
showing
up
and
being
prepared
for
conferences,
were
also
placed
upon
me
as
obligations
to
my
WA.
I
call
this
situation
fortunate
because
it
gave
me
room
to
experiment
with
ideas
that
I
received
from
my
WA
and
which
in
a
sense
evolved
into
tried
and
tested
techniques.
Through
my
own
writing
and
ideas
deliberated
upon
during
my
class
WA
conferences
I
was
able
to
implement
and
observe
changes
in
my
writing.
This
process
led
me
to
incorporate
accurate
focus
and
conciseness
in
my
writing.
Consequently,
my
Research
Methods
class
taught
me
to
support
one
claim
or
stance,
using
different
types
of
evidence.
While
it
was
difficult
to
comprehend
and
apply
the
various
methods
that
were
covered
in
the
class,
I
found
that
the
general
principle
behind
the
class
itself
had
many
applications
in
my
WA
conferences.
Indeed,
my
fall
WA
assignment
to
a
First
Year
Seminar,
which
examined
the
implications
of
the
theory
of
risk,
was
in
many
ways
a
class
on
research
methods.
I
found
this
to
be
evident
in
the
fact
that
the
essential
challenge
before
the
students
was
to
determine
risk
in
any
given
situation
or
to
analyze
the
contributions
of
various
historical
figures
into
the
field
of
risk.
Hence
students
had
the
option
to
choose
any
field
where
they
could
analyze
the
implications
of
risk
and
make
the
case
that
risk
had
invariably
shaped
numerous
industries
and
sectors
of
life
today.
With
the
above
influences,
my
technique
as
a
WA
was
able
to
evolve
into
a
more
involved
writing
consultant
who
was
aware
that
students
appreciate
the
knowledge
a
WA
can
bring
through
a
variety
of
techniques
for
supporting
their
ideas.
Furthermore,
remembering
that
I
was
also
under
the
guidance
of
a
fellow
WA
in
one
my
classes,
taught
me
the
crucial
skill
of
restating
to
students
the
bare
essentials
of
an
assignment
that
they
were
expected
to
meet.
While
this
process
of
restatement
provided
an
avenue
for
focus
within
student
and
my
own
assignments,
it
also
invariably
was
dependent
on
WA
conversations
with
the
class
professors.
During
my
assignment
briefings
with
professors,
I
always
urged
the
professors
to
articulate
simply
and
clearly
what
essentials
students
had
to
achieve
or
demonstrate
in
their
assignments.
While
some
may
feel
that
this
process
of
outlining
an
assignmentOs
NdoOsO
and
NdonOtOsO
can
in
some
ways
curtail
the
creativity
of
the
writer,
it
is
nonetheless
necessary.
It
has
been
my
experience
that
the
process
of
articulating
to
the
students
the
main
essentials
that
a
professor
expects
to
see
addressed
in
their
assignments
is
often
an
effective
way
of
providing
students
with
the
key
ideas
or
checks
to
be
addressed
when
rewriting
their
drafts.
While
obtaining
clear
directions
from
a
professor
is
paramount,
during
the
spring
semester
I
benefited
from
receiving
the
counsel
of
a
number
of
professors
through
fellow
WAOs.
My
WA
assignment
happened
to
be
a
VAST
class
that
had
four
different
sections
taught
by
three
professors
and
hence
the
need
for
four
WAOs
for
each
class.
I
had
my
first
meeting
with
all
three
professors
and
subsequent
meetings
with
my
section
professor.
Nonetheless,
the
very
first
meeting
provided
a
clear
direction
and
description
of
the
goals
of
the
class,
which
was
in
a
way
made
clearer
by
hearing
it
from
three
different
people.
In
addition,
having
other
WAOs
with
conferences
on
the
same
assignments
turned
out
to
be
very
useful.
Realizing
that
each
WA
brought
their
own
technique
to
the
class,
it
was
interesting
to
observe
the
different
analogies
that
we
would
employ
in
addressing
assignment
goals.
Furthermore,
we
were
always
a
resource
for
each
other
when
any
particular
student
problems
arose
because
we
gradually
built
our
knowledge
on
the
class
mechanics
through
the
various
assignments.
During
instances
where
it
was
difficult
to
cross-reference
with
each
other
due
to
specific
instructions
given
by
professors,
I
reminded
myself
that
each
class
section
was
trying
to
reach
the
same
destination
and
that
there
were
different
ways
of
getting
there.
With
this
attitude,
I
was
in
turn
able
to
appreciate
the
multitude
of
techniques
that
the
other
WAOs
and
myself
used
in
approaching
WA
conferences.
The
primary
focus
of
the
VAST
class
was
to
develop
competence
in
technical
writing
in
the
engineering
field.
Therefore,
students
were
challenged
to
write
in
a
direct
and
concise
manner
but
without
leaving
out
any
details.
However,
as
I
soon
found
out,
most
students
interpreted
being
concise
and
direct
as
writing
relatively
brief
papers.
As
a
result,
many
of
my
conferences
focused
upon
enhancing
material
that
students
presented
in
their
first
drafts
so
that
readers
could
make
the
same
logical
conclusions
and
assumptions
that
the
writers
made.
Furthermore,
reminding
the
students
that
although
they
were
engineers,
in
the
real
world
many
non-engineers
would
have
to
read
and
comprehend
their
recommendations.
Hence,
it
was
this
final
approach
that
challenged
writers
to
take
into
consideration
their
audience
that
allowed
most
students
to
improve
their
writing.
Similarly,
I
took
a
class
on
Political
Economy,
which
placed
a
great
emphasis
on
persuading
your
potential
audience
to
your
point
of
view
based
on
research.
In
this
class,
after
carrying
out
research
either
through
economic
regressions
or
appropriate
mathematical
methods,
one
would
have
to
interpret
their
results
and
present
these
findings
to
various
policy
makers.
Given
that
often
times
our
data
sets
were
made
up
of
data
of
nations
or
states,
our
potential
audiences
were
usually
policymakers
in
government.
Hence
with
this
kind
of
audience,
our
written
work
had
to
reflect
the
concepts
of
measurement
using
econometric
theory
and
lingo,
while
at
the
same
time
being
accessible
to
an
audience
that
might
not
necessarily
understand
conclusions
explained
in
purely
econometric
terms.
While
the
writing
technique
of
catering
to
a
specific
audience
was
difficult
to
muster,
even
more
challenging
was
the
ability
to
self
critique
my
writing
and
intellectual
ideas.
My
first
encounter
with
this
challenge
was
in
my
Black
Politics
and
Drama
class
where
students
were
required
to
write
expositive
argumentative
essays
on
material
covered
in
lectures.
These
essays
could
either
propose
alternative
hypotheses
for
the
various
issues
or
argue
against
a
particular
point
of
view.
In
addition,
the
process
of
choosing
oneOs
topic
was
critical
in
order
to
be
certain
that
the
essayOs
arguments
could
be
logically
and
analytically
developed
with
as
much
retrospection
as
was
possible
at
the
time.
In
my
case,
the
process
of
introspection
continued
beyond
the
classroom
as
a
regular
contributor
to
AYA
Magazine,
which
is
a
campus
periodical
dedicated
to
analyzing
issues
of
diversity
at
Lafayette
and
beyond.
In
this
instance,
as
much
as
my
contributions
were
edited
by
an
editorial
team,
I
still
had
to
critique
my
own
writing
more
than
I
usually
do
because
I
had
to
take
into
consideration
the
potentially
large
audience
that
would
read
and
critique
my
articles.
While
handling
criticism
of
oneOs
writing
is
always
a
good
skill
to
embody,
when
faced
with
a
reading
audience
beyond
class
professors,
this
skill
is
absolutely
necessary
for
peace
of
mind.
The
pressure
placed
upon
me
knowing
that
my
articles
were
to
be
read
by
a
wider
audience
definitely
enhanced
my
self-critique
skills
but
most
times,
a
second
reader
is
always
the
strongest
critique
available.
Hence
in
the
same
way
that
the
AYA
editor
would
seek
explanation
of
statements
made
in
my
pieces,
I
would
also
ask
my
WA
students
questions
of
their
essays.
During
the
past
year,
I
found
that
asking
questions
and
hearing
a
student
articulate
their
thoughts
or
arguments
often
went
a
long
way
in
improving
a
first
draft.
The
articulation
of
oneOs
ideas
that
had
already
been
presented
on
paper,
almost
seemed
to
serve
as
the
subconscious
affirming
and
resolving
to
make
clearer
statements
of
those
ideas
already
written
down
but
not
easily
obvious
to
a
second
reader.
Interestingly,
while
I
fostered
a
desire
to
have
my
articles
for
AYA
Magazine
heavily
critiqued,
I
also
fostered
the
same
desires
for
all
of
my
class
papers.
Getting
a
good
grade
on
a
paper
was
no
longer
sufficient
for
me
without
accompanying
remarks
on
what
could
have
been
more
powerful,
researched
or
concise.
In
this
regard,
and
together
with
my
experience
of
having
a
WA
while
being
a
WA,
I
hoped
that
I
provided
my
students
with
substantive
and
constructive
critiques
of
their
writing.
Hence
my
technique
evolved
from
only
looking
at
the
insufficiencies
of
a
paper
but
also
exploring
the
strengths
of
my
studentsO
papers
with
the
aim
of
enhancing
their
personal
styles.
However,
in
classes
where
students
are
presented
with
specific
instructions
on
how
to
and
what
to
write,
it
inevitably
becomes
difficult
for
the
students
to
assert
their
personal
styles.
While
it
may
seem
contradictory,
in
my
opinion,
having
a
personal
style
usually
brings
in
something
interesting
to
an
assignment
rather
than
plainly
meeting
the
requirements
in
question.
Consequently,
explaining
to
students
that
they
need
to
tactfully
insert
their
personal
views
or
feelings
in
the
context
of
the
topics
that
they
write
about
is
often
difficult.
I
have
found
this
to
be
true
especially
in
cases
where
students
lack
sufficient
preparatory
writing
skills
or
in
cases
where
for
some
reason,
the
material
to
be
discussed
is
not
fully
understood
by
the
student.
In
the
latter
case,
students
will
often
produce
sufficient
but
not
convincing
essays.
Striving
to
help
students
write
persuasive
essays
be
they
argumentative
or
expositive
assignments
has
been
one
of
my
greater
challenges
during
the
past
year.
Difficult
because
at
the
college
level,
most
students
can
write
sufficiently
well
but
many
write
well
without
passion
or
conviction
for
writing
given
the
content
of
assignments.
Even
I
have
fallen
prey
to
this
predicament
because
often
times,
handing
an
assignment
in
on
time
becomes
the
goal
of
writing
for
grades.
While
it
would
be
impossible
to
work
without
deadlines,
it
is
critical
for
students
not
to
equate
beating
deadlines
with
achieving
the
goals
of
the
class.
My
writing
experiences
thus
far
have
allowed
me
to
view
my
writing
as
a
critical
text
of
myself.
While
I
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
in
definitively
discovering
my
writing
style,
I
would
like
to
impart
upon
my
WA
students
to
see
the
development
of
their
writing
as
the
development
of
their
intellectual
thought
processes.
Through
this
tedious
but
worthwhile
process,
I
believe
many
students
will
be
able
to
write
with
convincing
passion
in
any
genre
of
writing.
However,
with
limited
interest
and/
or
time,
many
students
fail
to
put
in
enough
effort
to
critically
view
themselves
through
their
writing.
In
the
next
year,
I
look
forward
to
putting
into
practice
my
lessons
from
the
last
year
as
far
as
writing
for
different
audiences
and
writing
convincing
pieces
of
work.
For
my
future
WA
students,
I
hope
to
be
able
to
impart
my
knowledge
of
audience
types
and
writing
genres
to
the
development
of
the
studentsO
personal
styles.
While
my
current
experience
has
shown
that
the
personal
style
can
be
quite
elusive,
I
feel
that
it
is
worth
searching
for
and
improving
gradually.
