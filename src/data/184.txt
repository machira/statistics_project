Literacy
Narrative
Ever
since
first
grade
I
have
had
memories
of
writing.
I'll
never
forget
when
Mrs.
Jamieson,
my
first
grade
teacher,
helped
us
write
letters
to
our
friends
in
different
states.
Since
I
had
just
moved
to
Connecticut
from
Pennsylvania
I
was
thrilled
to
write
to
the
friends
I
had
left.
I
remember
writing
on
Mickey
Mouse
paper
and
asking
my
friend
how
she
was
doing
and
how
first
grade
was
for
her.
This
first
memory
of
writing
allowed
me
to
communicate
with
someone
I
really
missed
and
showed
me
how
important
it
was
to
write.
Since
then
I
started
writing
to
pen
pals
all
over
the
country
when
opportunities
came
about
in
elementary
school.
However,
not
all
writing
was
for
pleasure
and
correspondence.
Second
grade
I
learned
script.
It
was
very
hard
at
first
but
I
practiced
a
lot
and
then
I
was
able
to
write
sentences
and
later
poems,
letters,
and
short
stories.
I
loved
writing
in
script
and
everything
I
did
for
a
few
years
after
that
was
never
in
print.
I
have
vivid
memories
about
writing
poems,
daily
journals,
and
creative
stories
in
which
the
teacher
had
developed
the
first
line.
I
have
memories
of
many
written
papers
that
were
very
important
to
me
in
elementary
school.
My
paper
on
golden
retrievers,
medieval
times,
cats,
and
family
vacations
are
among
many
different
topics
I
chose
to
write
about.
I
think
the
reason
I
loved
to
write
so
much
was
because
I
never
had
a
problem
finding
a
topic
to
write
about.
Since
I
have
a
very
vivid
imagination,
daydreaming
has
been
a
passion
and
my
inner
journeys
have
often
been
released
on
paper.
Although
many
times
teachers
have
given
us
certain
topics
to
write
about,
I
still
have
had
no
problem
elaborating
on
a
certain
issue.
I
love
to
research
things
to
find
out
more
about
various
places,
times,
people,
and
animals.
The
most
common
writing
that
my
teachers
assigned
were
stories
that
have
already
been
started
and
we
had
to
finish
them.
Throughout
my
whole
writing
career
I
have
basically
sat
down,
just
like
I
did
in
those
middle
elementary
years,
and
started
to
write
whatever
came
to
my
mind.
Yes,
there
were
rough
drafts
and
outlines
required
sometimes
and
I
dreaded
them
because
I
have
always
felt
that
my
best
writing
comes
to
me
when
I
allow
myself
to
enter
a
sort
of
zone
in
which
I
am
almost
"in"
the
paper.
This
ability
to
just
start
writing
started
when
I
had
to
sit
in
class
and
just
write.
There
were
no
rough
drafts
or
anything
else,
just
me,
my
yellow
paper,
and
pencil
until
the
red
marker
came.
In
fifth
grade
my
work
was
challenged.
My
writing
was
no
longer
just
accepted
without
question
as
it
was
in
the
past.
Suddenly
my
ideas
were
examined
and
analyzed
and
my
style
of
writing
was
critiqued.
Peer
evaluation
came
into
every
English
class.
I
had
to
look
at
other
students
work
and
tell
them
what
I
thought
of
their
papers
while
they
did
the
same
to
me.
At
first
I
did
not
want
other
students
to
read
my
work
but
eventually
I
realized
that
they
all
had
very
good
ideas
for
improvement.
I
learned
after
this
valuable
English
class
that
two
or
three
pairs
of
eyes
are
a
lot
more
affective
than
one.
Sixth
grade
came,
and
with
it
a
large
amount
of
book
reports.
I
had
always
written
book
reports
before
in
my
classes
but
now
we
were
reading
books
on
our
own
and
writing
summaries
as
well
as
our
reactions
to
the
authors
and
books.
At
this
point
I
was
writing
a
lot
more
and
really
evaluating
what
I
was
reading
at
the
same
time.
There
were
no
longer
simple
reports
on
golden
retrievers
or
Colonial
Williamsburg.
This
is
when
my
reading
and
writing
had
begun
to
change
and
take
on
a
more
analytical
side.
Although
I
was
still
praised
for
my
work
because
I
always
put
a
lot
of
effort
in
to
every
assignment,
I
felt
myself
changing
my
writing
slightly
to
really
report
what
was
occurring
in
the
books
I
was
reading.
After
elementary
school
I
was
pretty
prepared
for
middle
school.
Most
of
my
writing
was
still
book
reports
and
poems.
But
now
a
new
form
of
writing
was
being
implemented
in
my
science
class.
I
had
to
write
a
lab
report.
At
first
I
thought
this
would
be
simple
and
although
it
was,
I
was
not
used
to
this
type
of
writing.
I
had
always
loved
more
creative
writing
in
which
I
could
unleash
my
wild
imagination.
Now
I
was
forced
to
become
concerned
with
reporting
facts
and
forming
charts.
However,
my
final
project
in
my
7th
grade
science
class
was
not
a
lab
report.
It
was
a
paper
on
Oceanography.
I
loved
doing
this
paper
and
it
was
my
first
long
paper
because
it
was
over
6
pages.
However,
I
researched
so
much
about
whales
and
ocean
life
that
I
could
have
gone
on
forever.
I
had
to
limit
my
writing
and
make
the
interesting
facts
that
I
had
learned
presentable
to
my
audience.
This
was
my
first
experience
with
a
research
paper.
However,
since
then
I
have
done
more
research
papers
than
I
can
count.
Every
year
in
high
school
we
were
assigned
the
dreaded
I-search
paper.
This
is
a
huge
paper
that
is
assigned
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
year
but
almost
everyone
waits
until
the
last
minute
to
start
writing
it.
The
I-search
is
a
paper
in
which
there
is
a
lot
of
free
will
to
write
in
whatever
style
you
choose.
To
understand
my
writing
in
high
school,
a
brief
description
of
each
of
my
four
papers
is
somewhat
necessary.
Freshman
year
I
learned
of
the
I-search
when
upper-classmen
used
to
say
ohhh--
that
paper
is
going
to
kill
you.
Everyone
said
to
start
early
but
I
never
listened.
However,
freshman
year
we
were
given
hardly
any
guidelines.
We
were
just
told
to
pick
a
subject
that
seamed
interesting
to
us
and
that
we
wanted
to
learn
more
about.
I
chose
scuba
diving.
I
wrote
a
great
paper
that
was
fifteen
pages
and
then
I
gave
a
great
oral
presentation.
I
was
pretty
surprised
because
the
paper
seemed
reasonable
and
although
I
waited
to
the
last
minute,
I
pulled
it
off
with
flying
colors.
Sophomore
year
was
not
interesting
because
again
it
was
just
like
freshman
year
and
I
chose
to
write
about
the
rain
forest
this
time.
I
learned
a
lot
about
the
rain
forest
and
again
I
realized
how
much
I
liked
doing
this
"dreaded"
I-Search
paper.
However,
junior
year
was
probably
my
best
experience
with
the
I-Search.
My
english
teacher
allowed
us
unbelievable
freedom
to
write
a
paper
that
would
be
very
interesting.
I
chose
the
Beatles
this
time
because
we
all
had
to
pick
an
American
artist
or
a
person
who
had
a
lot
of
influence
on
America.
This
paper
was
a
lot
of
fun
to
write.
I
had
to
analyze
the
Beatles
music
and
write
about
their
creativity
and
their
impact
on
music
and
American
culture.
I
was
allowed
to
swear
in
this
paper
and
vividly
describe
the
Beatles
in
my
own
style.
My
teacher
loved
the
paper
and
really
saw
how
I
had
become
a
Beatles
expert.
Senior
year
was
probably
the
hardest
I-Search
I
had
to
do.
This
paper
was
very
structured
and
MLA
format
writing
had
to
be
applied.
This
paper
was
about
an
American
author
and
we
had
to
read
three
of
their
works
and
read
criticism
and
write
our
own
criticism
as
well.
I
chose
Arthur
Miller
because
I
loved
his
plays.
This
paper
turned
out
amazingly
well
also.
I
went
to
do
my
research
in
college
libraries
and
I
took
notes
on
index
cards
and
I
wrote
this
paper
a
little
more
slowly
than
the
others
because
there
were
so
many
different
parts
that
all
linked
together.
When
I
completed
this
paper
and
received
my
fourth
A
on
my
four
I-Search
papers
over
the
years,
I
was
extremely
satisfied
with
this
paper
that
the
English
department
required
each
year.
These
twenty
plus
page
papers
really
helped
me
grow
as
a
writer
and
analyze
different
subjects.
I
wrote
creatively,
subjectively,
and
objectively.
I
formed
theses
and
built
large
research
papers
from
them.
I
strengthened
my
opening
paragraphs
and
conclusions
and
I
really
learned
how
to
write
papers
in
parts,
instead
of
just
at
one
sitting.
I
realized
that
is
ability
is
just
as
important
as
the
instant
burst
of
writing
at
one
shot.
Throughout
high
school,
I-Search
papers
were
definitely
an
important
part
of
my
history
as
a
writer.
However,
all
of
my
classes
involved
various
forms
of
writing.
In
my
history
classes
writing
was
a
very
important
part
of
learning
the
subject
matter
and
my
in-class
and
research
papers
all
counted
the
same
as
a
test.
In
my
United
States
history
classes
I
learned
how
to
develop
a
one
line
thesis
and
build
my
paper
off
of
this
important
idea.
I
wrote
papers
on
Thomas
Jefferson^
The
Civil
War
and
other
significant
historical
events.
I
always
did
very
well
on
these
papers
and
enjoyed
writing
them
and
learning
about
new
subject
material.
After
the
four
I-Searches
and
my
history
papers
I
realized
how
much
I
loved
to
research
a
certain
topic
and
then
write
a
detailed
account
of
the
information
that
I
had
learned.
Although
research
papers
are
my
favorite
type
of
writing,
I
also
learned
how
easy
lab
reports
were
in
my
four
science
classes
in
high
school.
I
had
always
loved
science
and
when
I
could
report
my
findings
in
a
sort
of
paper
called
a
lab
report
I
was
thrilled.
I
combined
science
and
writing
and
realized
how
I
could
accurately
portray
the
methods,
materials,
results,
and
conclusions
of
our
different
labs.
This
type
of
writing
style
was
very
different
than
I
was
used
to
though.
The
papers
were
shorter
and
were
broken
into
various
sections.
I
had
an
outline
to
work
from
and
I
had
to
include
facts
and
data
which
would
normally
not
be
found
in
my
creative
writing
and
research
papers.
These
lab
reports
and
my
ease
in
completing
them
success
continued
to
my
biology
class
in
college.
However,
I
must
say
that
I
did
experience
a
few
surprises
in
my
freshman
year
as
a
college
student.
All
of
a
sudden
my
writing
was
not
A
work.
My
lab
reports
came
back
with
red
pen
because
specific
small
details
were
left
out
or
the
order
was
wrong.
My
First
Year
Seminar
teacher
loved
using
his
red
pen
on
my
work
as
well.
Some
of
the
papers
that
I
was
writing
came
back
with
B's
and
C's
and
I
thought
they
were
very
good.
I
did
not
understand
what
was
happening.
I
had
assumed
that
I
was
still
going
to
do
well
in
college
and
I
thought
I
was
very
well
prepared
for
college
writing.
I
was
both
wrong
and
right.
I
was
adequately
prepared
for
college
writing
because
of
the
advanced
placement
english
classes
I
had
and
all
my
papers
and
valuable
lessons
on
grammar
and
creative
writing.
However,
I
was
not
ready
for
a
professor
who
has
seen
many
different
types
of
writing
every
semester
for
years.
I
was
also
competing
with
a
wide
array
of
talented
students
with
various
backgrounds.
When
it
came
down
to
it,
I
was
a
very
good
bullshitter
in
high
school
and
I
knew
how
to
make
my
papers
interesting.
My
FYS
professor
did
not
want
fancy
words,
he
wanted
a
direct
approach
to
the
given
assignments.
I
quickly
learned
that
I
needed
to
alter
my
writing
style
so
that
I
would
be
able
to
make
my
work
interesting
but
also
more
direct.
I
talked
with
my
professor
and
WA
and
I
learned
a
few
things
I
could
do
to
improve
my
work.
I
implemented
these
new
ideas
to
my
FYS
class,
Biology
lab,
and
Women's
Studies
class.
I
had
papers
in
all
of
my
classes
of
various
lengths.
For
the
first
time
there
were
final
papers
that
replaced
final
exams.
At
first
I
thought
I
would
not
like
this
and
there
would
be
so
much
work
involved.
But
both
my
final
paper
on
Jim
Carey
for
my
FYS
and
my
paper
on
motherhood
for
Women's
Studies
turned
out
very
well.
They
were
both
very
interesting
to
research
and
write.
They
proved
to
be
just
like
my
I-Search
papers
in
high
school
and
I
was
relieved
to
write
instead
of
study
for
hours
for
an
exam.
When
I
look
back
now
through
my
elementary,
high
school,
and
freshman
year
at
college
I
can
see
a
major
growth
in
my
writing
ability.
I
have
had
great
experiences
with
writing
such
as
my
I-Searches
and
lab
reports
that
were
always
praised
by
teachers.
I
have
also
had
bad
experiences
with
professors
not
liking
my
work
and
thinking
I
needed
a
lot
of
improvement
in
even
a
basic
journal
entry.
However,
both
the
good
and
the
bad
have
helped
me
learn
a
lot
about
myself
and
my
writing.
Through
writing
I
have
gained
an
appreciation
for
many
different
people,
places,
and
issues.
I
have
also
been
able
to
voice
my
opinion
through
paper
and
pen.
Yet
the
most
important
thing
to
me
is
that
I
have
learned
so
much
about
various
topics
because
I
have
had
to
write
about
them.
Writing
for
me
is
a
way
of
learning
and
remembering
what
I
have
learned.
Studying
for
an
exam
can
simply
be
cramming
and
spitting
back
information.
But
when
I
write
I
need
to
know
what
I
am
talking
about
before
I
can
put
my
thoughts
into
words.
Writing
has
forced
me
to
look
at
my
world
around
me,
analyze
and
think
about
it,
and
then
really
find
a
way
to
express
my
thoughts
and
opinions
about
topics
ranging
from
animals,
to
people,
to
wars,
and
physics.
After
writing
this
paper
I
can
look
back
and
see
how
much
I
have
developed
as
a
writer
and
how
my
writing
has
helped
me
grow
as
an
individual.
It
has
also
allowed
me
to
communicate
with
others
in
a
concise
and
affective
way.
I
am
happy
that
I
have
had
so
many
opportunities
to
write
and
that
I
enjoy
it
so
much.
I
hope
my
appreciation
of
writing
and
my
success
with
the
whole
process
continues
throughout
the
rest
of
my
college
years.
