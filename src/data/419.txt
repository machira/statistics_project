New
WA
Literacy
Narrative
Using
Words
I
remember
only
one
scene
from
the
movie
NE.T.,O
and
never
having
seen
the
movie
again,
I
am
left
to
guess
that
what
I
saw
bears
little
to
no
importance
in
the
movie.
I
distinctly
remember
sitting
down
in
my
family
room,
inches
away
from
the
television
set,
and
watching
the
little
boy
on
the
screen
scribble
a
note
down.
Scribble
is
an
appropriate
word,
because
I
also
remember
thinking,
Nso,
thatOs
how
you
write.O
But,
at
this
point
in
my
life,
at
an
age
I
canOt
put
my
finger
on,
I
know
I
hadnOt
had
any
formal
lessons
in
penmanship
or
grammar,
yet,
I
was
mildly
convinced
I
knew
how
to
write.
From
then
on,
when
my
motherOs
friends
would
call,
I
would
take
down
their
elaborate
messages
(which
really
only
contained
simplicities
like,
NMrs.
Hurley
called,O)
and
proudly
present
them
to
my
mother.
While
cleaning
my
house
recently,
I
stumbled
across
a
few
of
what
my
mother
considers
to
be
keepsakes,
and
inside
stacks
of
scraps
of
paper,
I
found
some
of
these
notes.
They
most
definitely
are
not
legible,
and
the
only
reason
I
can
even
guess
as
to
what
they
say
is
because
my
mother
wrote
their
translations
down
in
the
upper
left
corner
of
each
one.
IOm
still
not
quite
sure
how
she
knew
what
they
said;
perhaps,
she
pretended
to
understand
them
and
let
me
explain
each
one,
or
maybe
she
just
guessed.
Either
way,
I
was
intrigued
by
the
art
of
writing,
and
apparently,
I
left
notes
everywhere
about
everythingNabout
how
badly
my
brothers
were
behaving
and
how
much
I
loved
my
parents.
Most
young
childhood
memories
about
writing
probably
involve
a
crayon
or
washable
marker;
I
remember
having
huge
wall
crayons
that
you
could
use
in
the
bathtub
and
decorate
the
tiles
with
that
wouldnOt
stain
anything.
Nothing
strikes
me
about
those
memories
though;
I
drew
the
normal
stick
figure
families
holding
hands
underneath
bright
yellow
suns.
As
to
formal
schooling,
in
preschool
we
were
read
to,
in
kindergarten
we
had
to
learn
the
alphabet
and
traced
uppercase
and
lowercase
print
letters,
but
first
grade
proved
much
more
influential
in
shaping
my
literacy
development
(and
not
necessarily
in
a
good
way).
In
first
grade,
we
learned
how
to
properly
hold
a
pencil.
Or
at
least,
the
other
kids
in
my
class
probably
did.
My
aunt
(technically,
she
is
my
uncleOs
ex-wife
now;
maybe
they
were
having
problems
then,
I
donOt
know,)
was
my
first
grade
teacher,
and
in
first
grade
you
had
one
teacher
for
all
your
lessons,
so
I
was
with
her
all
day
long.
I
was
only
seven
years
old;
most
of
the
time,
I
remembered
to
call
her
Mrs.
Ziznewski,
but
on
occasion,
I
accidentally
called
her
Aunt
Ruth.
Those
times
that
I
forgot
were
the
worst;
I
would
be
humiliated
in
front
of
the
class
with
a
scolding
about
how
I
should
not
beg
for
preference
by
reminding
her
of
our
familial
relations.
Let
me
remind
you
again,
I
was
only
seven
years
old.
Mrs.
knew
it
would
be
improper
to
show
favoritism,
so
she
did
the
oppositeNthe
polar
opposite.
Learning
how
to
properly
hold
a
pencil
was
the
major
goal
in
the
first
few
weeks
of
school,
but
Mrs.
avoided
spending
time
teaching
me
how
to
mold
my
fingers
around
the
utensil
so
to
provide
adequate
force
and
balance.
Instead,
when
my
mother
complained
I
was
having
trouble,
she
sent
home
a
few
of
the
rubber
molds
that
sit
at
the
bottom
of
your
pencil
that
are
supposed
to
be
resting
places
for
your
fingers
until
you
adapt
to
the
awkward
position.
My
fingers
never
adapted
though,
and
to
this
day
I
hold
my
writing
implements
with
my
thumb
steadying
it
on
one
side
with
my
pointer,
middle,
and
ring
fingers
dutifully
next
to
each
other
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
thumb.
I
think
my
penmanship
is
more
than
legible;
itOs
terrible
if
I
try
to
hold
a
pen
the
proper
way,
and
for
the
most
part
my
way
suits
my
writing
fine.
ItOs
only
in
long
examinations
that
my
wrist
suffers
from
the
position,
but
I
suppose
most
people
cramp
up
after
two
or
three
hours
of
writing.
The
only
time
I
even
think
about
it
is
when
people
ask
why
I
hold
my
pen
like
an
unskilled
child,
and
I
am
forced
to
answer,
NBecause,
I
was
never
taught
otherwise.O
Mrs.
ZiznewskiOs
(IOll
try
to
avoid
calling
her
my
aunt,
I
wouldnOt
want
anyone
to
think
I
was
hoping
to
be
pampered,)
plan
to
ignore
me
for
the
other
childrenOs
sake
did
not
end
after
everyone
else
learned
how
to
hold
their
pencil.
My
mother
apparently
saved
a
lot
of
things,
most
of
which
turned
out
to
be
useless
and
got
thrown
away;
however,
I
held
onto
a
few
of
my
assignments
from
Mrs.
ZiznewskiOs
class.
My
workbooks
and
projects
are
peppered
with
what
I
recognize
now
as
snide
comments,
noting
my
hand
looked
shaky
on
some
assignments
(thanks
to
who?)
and
that
my
spelling
mistakes
were
distracting.
Mind
you,
we
didnOt
start
having
spelling
lessons
in
school
until
the
second
grade,
and
my
mother,
who
is
a
reading
specialist
with
two
Masters
degrees,
has
pointed
out
to
me
many
times
that
young
children
should
not
be
forced
to
focus
only
on
spelling
and
grammar
or
else
it
deters
them
from
writing
creatively
since
they
are
too
bogged
down
with
semantics.
Besides,
on
the
papers
she
mentioned
my
spelling
on,
I
only
had
one
or
two
mistakes.
We
had
a
daily
class
journal
where
each
day
a
different
student
would
write
down
some
news
to
share
with
everyone;
I
wrote
about
how
my
grandfather
had
cancer
in
his
eye
and
needed
to
get
it
removed,
and
was
chastised
for
writing
something
so
personal.
I
was
discouraged
after
my
first
real
year
of
schooling;
I
enjoyed
reading,
but
avoided
sharing
my
work
with
my
parents
or
others.
In
the
second
grade,
I
was
blessed
with
a
kind,
caring,
compassionate
teacher
who
pushed
all
her
students
to
excel
and
encouraged
all
writing
no
matter
how
many
spelling
mistakes
or
how
personal
the
content.
Thankfully,
I
feel
she
may
have
managed
to
reverse
all
the
damage
Mrs.
may
have
done.
After
that
I
didnOt
think
too
much
about
my
writing
for
quite
some
time.
In
the
second
grade
I
took
an
IQ
test
because
I
was
doing
exceptionally
well
in
school;
after
the
results
came
back
my
parents
got
a
letter
sent
home.
It
invited
me
to
join
what
our
school
district
called
the
P.E.G.
program,
which
stood
for
Progress
for
the
Extraordinarily
Gifted.
It
meant
for
the
duration
that
I
would
be
in
elementary
school,
which
in
Metuchen
meant
grades
three
through
five,
I
would
be
one
of
the
five
kids
from
each
grade
pulled
into
a
separate
classroom
for
the
entirety
of
the
day.
So,
instead
of
going
to
science
and
social
studies
with
an
assigned
homeroom
and
then
being
placed
by
ability
into
math
and
reading
classes,
fifteen
of
us
had
one
teacher
for
interdisciplinary
subjects
all
day.
My
parents
fought
about
this,
because
my
mother
didnOt
want
me
secluded
from
the
rest
of
the
school.
Those
of
us
involved
in
the
program
interacted
at
lunch
and
recess,
and
were
eventually
integrated
better
with
the
rest
of
the
students,
but
looking
back,
my
mother
may
have
been
right.
I
was
embarrassed
by
my
placement;
I
assumed
other
students
thought
I
was
nerdy
and
a
bookworm.
As
far
as
writing
goes,
we
learned
big
vocabulary
words
for
third
graders
but
never
really
learned
how
to
apply
them.
Nor
can
I
remember
having
one
grammar
lesson
throughout
my
entire
elementary
and
middle
school
education.
I
didnOt
learn
the
power
behind
the
words
I
was
memorizing
until
sometime
after.
I
wrote
a
letter
when
I
was
twelve
years
old;
an
angry
letter,
one
of
those
you
write
to
get
everything
out
you
canOt
manage
to
say
out
loud.
I
donOt
know
if
I
truly
understood
the
therapeutic
power
of
writing
out
your
emotions
yet,
(I
never
kept
to
keeping
a
diaryNthey
always
felt
childish
and
stupid,)
and
I
had
not
yet
been
trained
in
the
art
of
forming
an
argument.
However,
the
angry
letter
was
more
than
necessary,
and
I
had
written
it
as
my
own
personal
act
of
revenge.
I
admit
freely
it
was
written
with
foul
intention,
which
I
still
feel
was
well
deserved.
Without
turning
this
into
a
novel,
my
motherOs
sister,
Linda,
had
contributed
greatly
to
the
upbringing
of
one
of
my
brothers
and
me.
Since
both
of
my
parents
worked,
she
was
essentially
a
substitute
parent
for
as
long
as
I
can
remember.
However,
when
the
distribution
of
a
large
inheritance
came
into
question
between
my
mother
and
her
sisters,
Linda
underhandedly
lied,
cheated,
and
stole
money
from
her
own
family.
I
felt
more
than
anger;
I
had
been
betrayed.
I
wrote
down
everything
I
felt
fluently
and
aggressively
in
the
heat
of
my
rage,
telling
Linda
everything
I
despised
about
what
she
did.
The
funny
thing
about
it
was,
not
that
I
have
spoken
to
her,
but
to
this
day
she
doesnOt
believe
the
letter
was
written
by
me.
Because
of
the
way
it
was
written
she
thought
it
had
to
have
been
composed
by
my
mother
with
my
name
forged
onto
it;
a
twelve
year
old
couldnOt
write
something
as
cutting
as
the
letter
had
been.
Hearing
that
refreshed
my
anger
to
the
point
where
I
wrote
another
letter;
another
letter
she
assumed
to
be
forged.
I
donOt
think
the
letters
sent
her
into
any
kind
of
moral
shock
where
she
rejected
her
previously
heinous
behavior
seeking
penance,
but
I
realized
how
strongly
emotion
could
come
out
through
the
written
word.
I
donOt
think
I
could
have
made
my
point
louder
screaming
it
at
the
top
of
my
lungs.
I
donOt
know
if
I
have
ever
used
my
writing
the
same
way
sense.
I
was
young,
and
perhaps
my
lack
of
formal
structure
left
my
words
to
be
colored
with
the
unadulterated
hatred
I
felt
at
the
time.
I
didnOt
know
how
to
politely,
yet
firmly,
form
an
argument
based
on
fact
without
relying
solely
on
personal
feeling.
I
didnOt
know
my
letters
were
probably
what
would
be
defined
now
as
a
Nstream
of
consciousnessO
exercise
meant
for
brainstorming,
not
final
drafts.
I
didnOt
even
know
how
to
edit
out
my
emotion
by
writing
a
rough
copy
and
revising;
everything
was
raw.
In
high
school
there
was
a
heavier
focus
on
the
revision
process,
which
I
usually
ignored
because
my
grades
were
high
enough
without
it.
Besides,
in
my
junior
year
I
took
Advanced
Placement
Writing
which
centered
on
the
May
exam
in
which
essays
were
to
be
written
on
prompts
in
forty
minutes
time
without
any
revision.
We
practiced
endlessly,
and
our
teacher
rewarded
us
by
copying
the
better
responses
and
handing
them
out
to
the
class
(without
names,
of
course).
This
was
an
ego
boost,
but
it
also
reinforced
my
notion
that
revising
was
unnecessary.
Centering
the
majority
of
my
classes
on
the
AP
exams
meant
that
I
rarely
wrote
papers
outside
of
the
classroom
and
if
I
did
they
were
rarely
more
than
two
or
three
pages
long.
For
the
exams
we
needed
to
be
prepared
for
the
quick
prompts
and
document
based
questions,
which
were
like
mini-research
papers
when
the
primary
sources
had
already
been
found
for
you.
In
high
school
I
had
one
experience
writing
a
lengthy
research
paper
in
my
AP
United
States
history
class;
the
assignment
was
ten
pages
long
and
instead
of
parenthetical
citations
we
needed
to
use
footnotes.
This
proved
to
be
a
challenge,
and
inexperienced
as
I
was
it
took
about
four
times
longer
than
the
same
assignment
would
take
me
today,
but
I
feel
that
singular
assignment
helped
me
better
prepare
for
the
slew
of
five
and
ten
page
papers
thrown
at
you
as
a
college
writer.
Before
getting
into
college,
however,
you
need
to
write
an
admissions
essay.
I
wrote
about
ten
essays
for
my
applications
overall;
some
schools
got
the
same
essays,
some
schools
had
very
direct
questions,
others
wanted
writing
samples
that
still
had
the
teachersO
marks
on
them.
What
I
considered
to
be
my
best
essay
was
the
one
I
wrote
about
my
mother;
detailing
my
emotion
for
her
through
her
times
back
in
night
school
picking
up
her
two
Masters
degrees
and
how
we
both
dealt
with
her
fight
with
breast
cancer.
I
didnOt
mind
admissions
people
reading
it,
because
I
didnOt
know
them.
Yes,
they
were
going
to
be
judging
me,
but
they
were
supposed
to
be
judging
everybody.
I
received
positive
feedback
on
the
essay.
My
English
teacher
who
proofread
it
before
it
got
sent
into
the
likes
of
Lafayette
College
told
me
I
should
give
it
to
my
mother
on
the
rapidly
approaching
MotherOs
Day.
But,
she
didnOt
see
it
for
a
long
time.
There
were
times
when
we
fought
that
she
pulled
the
usual
guilt
trip
that
all
mothers
are
taught
by
their
mothers,
and
inside
I
was
thinking
that
maybe
she
really
didnOt
know
how
much
I
respected
her
because
I
never
really
said
it.
I
mean,
I
say
NI
love
you,O
multiple
times
a
dayEwhenever
we
get
off
the
phone,
before
bed;
but
to
sit
down
and
say
everything
that
came
across
so
naturally
in
the
essay
seemed
corny,
manufactured,
and
uncomfortable.
Sometime
during
my
freshman
year
at
college,
IOm
not
sure
why,
but
I
told
my
mother
where
I
kept
the
essay
and
I
asked
her
to
read
it
whenever
she
liked.
I
know
she
cried
(happy
tears)
but
I
donOt
think
thatOs
a
testament
to
my
writing
because
she
would
cry
if
it
was
written
with
thought
despite
how
many
errors
may
have
actually
plagued
the
pages.
This
was
the
opposite
of
an
angry
letter,
though.
This
was
writing
used
to
make
someone
happy,
to
do
good,
and
to
share
strength
and
power.
Despite
more
formal
training,
I
was
ready
for
college
writing
because
I
understood
how
powerfully
words
could
be
used;
to
both
hurt
and
help
people.
