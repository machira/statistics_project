NToday
JoAnn
cut
my
hair.
I
got
a
lollipop.
I
am
happy.O
I
was
four
years
old
and
had
a
new
haircut,
a
delicious
lollipop,
and
a
newfound
ability
to
express
myself
on
paper.
My
mother,
an
English
teacher,
had
made
it
a
point
to
instill
in
me
a
love
of
reading
and
writing
at
an
early
age,
and,
as
a
result,
helped
me
start
my
first
diary
at
the
age
of
four,
hoping
to
both
set
the
stage
for
a
future
affinity
for
writing
and
to
provide
me
a
means
to
cement
some
of
my
earliest
memories.
Although
I
do
not
now
remember
the
haircut
I
got
that
day
nor
the
flavor
of
the
lollipop
I
ate,
that
first
experience
in
writing
did
lay
the
foundation
for
a
career
in
writing
that
has
thus
far
done
exactly
what
my
mother
had
hoped
it
would:
provide
me
enjoyment,
success
in
academia,
and
a
means
to
document
my
past.
Since
that
initial
attempt,
writing
has
been
an
activity
that
I
have
enjoyed
immensely,
both
in
school
and
in
my
free
time.
It
is
only
due
to
a
number
of
formative
experiences,
however,
combined
with
the
encouragement
of
my
family,
friends,
and
teachers,
that
writing
has
become
such
a
rewarding
and
pleasurable
activity
for
me;
had
I
been
deprived
of
any
of
these
experiences
or
of
the
encouragement
of
others,
my
literacy
narrative
would
doubtless
read
much
differently.
One
of
the
first
of
such
experiences
occurred
during
Miss
VanderwallOs
class
in
first
grade.
Each
morning,
after
saying
the
pledge,
listening
to
the
morning
announcements,
and
completing
a
series
of
NDo
Nows,O
our
class
turned
its
attention
to
the
chalkboard,
on
which
a
question
about
our
families,
likes/dislikes,
aspirations,
or
some
other
topic
had
been
written.
The
class
was
then
given
fifteen
minutes
to
respond
to
the
question
of
the
day
in
our
journals.
I
looked
forward
to
writing
in
my
journal
each
day,
and
I
took
great
pride
when
I
was
able
to
generate
enough
words
to
overflow
into
the
margins
of
the
page.
One
day,
after
our
NDo
Nows,O
Miss
Vanderwall
had
a
special
announcement
for
the
class.
Next
week,
our
class
was
going
to
get
to
do
something
special.
Each
day,
instead
of
writing
responses
to
new
questions
during
journal
time,
she
was
going
to
select
a
number
of
students
to
read
their
best
responses
to
Mrs.
MagritchieOs
second
grade
class.
She
then
listed
the
names
of
the
students
who
were
going
to
make
the
sojourn
down
the
hallway
on
Monday.
My
name
was
on
the
list!
I
thought
for
sure
that
she
had
picked
her
favorite
writers
to
read
their
journals
first.
I
had
worked
so
hard
on
my
journal
responses,
and
she
thought
that
mine
were
the
best
in
the
class!
In
retrospect,
I
realize
that
all
of
the
students
had
had
the
opportunity
to
read
to
the
second
graders,
and
that
with
the
last
name
of
(alphabetically,
one
of
the
first
names
in
the
class),
it
was
no
surprise
that
I
was
chosen
to
read
on
the
first
day.
Nevertheless,
my
misunderstanding
led
me
to
see
writing
as
something
that
I
was
good
at
and
that
other
people
recognized
my
skill
in.
Whether
or
not
I
had
any
actual
talent
at
the
time,
I
began
to
spend
a
great
amount
of
time
writing,
having
been
unintentionally
encouraged
by
Miss
Vanderwall.
I
had
always
preferred
creative
projects
and
activities
to
watching
television,
and
after
first
grade,
I
began
to
trade
in
my
crayons
and
glue
sticks
for
a
pencil.
Instead
of
arts
and
crafts
projects,
I
began
to
write,
spending
countless
hours
each
day
in
my
family
room
creating
stories,
scripts,
poems,
and
songs.
I
also
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
attempting
to
document
the
highlights
of
my
days
in
journals,
after
reading
the
Little
House
on
the
Prairie
series
of
books
and
deciding
that
I
absolutely
had
to
become
the
next
Laura
Ingalls
Wilder.
Then
one
day
in
second
grade,
Mrs.
Cortese
gave
us
an
assignment
that
severely
cut
into
my
fun-writing
time:
my
first
book
report.
I
was
far
from
upset,
however,
about
this
intrusion
into
my
playtime;
on
the
contrary,
I
was
thrilled
to
have
the
opportunity
to
write
a
Nreal
paperO
and
play
Nreal
student.O
In
fact,
I
had
so
much
fun
playing
Nreal
studentO
that
I
began
to
have
my
mother
assign
me
extra
essays
to
write
at
home,
so
that
I
could
still
play
Nreal
studentO
when
there
was
no
real
paper
to
write.
Writing
had
clearly
become
something
that
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
doing,
and
I
viewed
it
not
as
annoying
homework,
but
as
a
fun
outlet
for
my
creativity.
By
fourth
grade,
I
had
received
the
opportunity
to
combine
the
creative
writing
projects
that
I
had
long
done
on
my
own
with
my
schoolwork,
an
opportunity
that
positively
enthralled
me.
Every
Friday,
Mrs.
Limone
gave
us
an
hour
to
write
and
self-publish
short
stories.
We
were
free
to
write
our
stories
about
anything
we
wanted
to,
and
after
brainstorming,
outlining,
writing,
and
editing
our
stories,
we
were
given
construction
paper,
glue
sticks,
colored
pencils,
and
binding
in
order
to
publish
them.
For
me,
this
was
an
invaluable
experience,
in
that
it
allowed
me
to
associate
writing
for
school,
more
so
than
ever,
with
fun
writing.
I
believe
that
it
was
absolutely
critical
to
my
future
relationship
with
writing
that
this
distinction
was
blurred
early
in
my
writing
career.
Because
Mrs.
Limone
taught
me
that
writing
for
school
did
not
have
to
consist
merely
of
factoid-heavy
essays
and
reports,
as
I
grew
older,
I
was
able
to
approach
various
writing
assignments
for
school
not
as
mere
chores
that
must
be
drudged
through,
but
as
opportunities
to
express
myself
and
to
demonstrate
my
creativity.
In
sixth
grade
came
yet
another
significant
milestone
event
in
my
writing
career.
Mrs.
Romeo,
my
Language
Arts
teacher,
presented
the
class
one
day
with
an
opportunity
to
be
published
in
an
anthology
of
local
student-written
poetry.
She
encouraged
us
all
to
submit
poems,
but
cautioned
us
that
not
all
of
our
poems
would
be
selected
for
publication.
Despite
this
warning,
I
wrote
a
poem
entitled
NStorm
SongO
and
crossed
my
fingers.
Several
months
later,
I
received
a
letter
in
the
mail
saying
that
my
poem
was
going
to
be
published!
I
was
elated.
For
something
that
I
enjoyed
doing
so
much
to
be
recognized
not
just
by
my
parents
and
teachers,
but
now
also
by
a
group
of
unbiased
outsiders,
was
thrilling.
Being
published
reaffirmed
my
love
of
writing,
and
I
began
to
spend
more
time
than
ever
writing
short
stories
and
poems
for
fun,
playing
with
different
styles
and
devices
that
I
read
in
books,
and
self-publishing
my
creations
the
way
I
had
been
taught
to
by
Mrs.
Limone.
By
the
end
of
middle
school,
writing
had
undeniably
become
something
that
I
greatly
enjoyed
doing.
In
eighth
grade,
however,
I
encountered
a
teacher
who
taught
me
now
not
only
to
enjoy
writing,
but
who
also
taught
me
how
to
write.
Mrs.
MacBurney
spent
countless
hours
teaching
grammar
lessons,
expanding
our
vocabulary,
and
providing
us
detailed
instructions
on
how
to
write
in
a
variety
of
different
styles
and
for
a
variety
of
different
audiences.
Mrs.
MacBurney
was
able,
therefore,
to
transform
me
from
someone
who
enjoyed
writing
to
someone
who
was
able
to
write
with
a
modicum
of
skill,
an
extremely
significant
turning
point
in
my
writing
career.
It
was
largely
due
to
the
lessons
learned
in
Mrs.
MacBurneyOs
class
that
I
was
able
to
find
a
great
deal
of
success
as
a
writer
in
high
school.
Although
I
was
at
first
concerned
that
my
writing
was
not
sophisticated
enough
for
high
school
classes,
my
freshman
English
teacher
praised
my
first
few
papers,
and
my
writing
proved
more
than
adequate
in
my
other
classes.
In
fact,
I
was
a
chronic
overachiever
who
constantly
went
above
and
beyond
the
requirements
of
my
assignments,
often
writing
far
more
detailed
and
complex
responses
than
necessary.
Although
I
now
realize
how
annoying
this
must
have
been
to
my
other
classmates,
at
the
time,
I
greatly
enjoyed
the
reactions
(as
well
as
the
grades)
that
I
received
from
teachers.
The
feedback
that
I
received
from
those
around
me
once
again
enforced
the
fact
that
writing
was
something
I
could
take
great
pride
in.
Because
writing
was
something
I
decided
I
wanted
to
and
could
excel
at,
I
worked
tirelessly
to
ensure
that
teacher
comments
read
NExcellent,O
NOutstanding,O
or
NFantastic;O
NSatisfactoryO
and
NGoodO
were
simply
unacceptable.
An
NAO
was
not
enough;
I
strove
for
the
NA+Os.O
I
viewed
each
piece
of
criticism
from
teachers
as
a
challenge
and
constantly
strove
to
achieve
the
perfect
paper.
Even
teachersO
positive
comments
drove
me;
if
a
teacher
told
me
I
had
written
a
NgoodO
paper,
I
needed
to
know
what
I
would
have
to
do
in
the
future
to
make
it
Ngreat.O
For
this
reason,
although
many
of
the
teachers
I
had
in
high
school
were
not
particularly
demanding,
the
demands
I
placed
on
myself
enabled
me
to
grow
as
a
writer
throughout
high
school.
It
was
not
without
the
assistance
of
several
of
my
high
school
teachers,
however,
that
I
was
able
to
mature
as
a
writer.
My
tenth
grade
English
teacher,
for
instance,
Mrs.
Bair,
assessed
our
class
after
reading
each
novel
with
a
take-home
essay.
Her
essays,
however,
were
not
standard
recap-the-plot
or
dissect-the-symbolism
essays;
she
instead,
created
assignments
that
required
a
certain
level
of
creativity.
She
had
us
write,
for
example,
letters
from
characters
of
one
book
to
another,
descriptions
of
how
we
would
adapt
certain
books
into
films,
and
essays
about
how
the
season
in
which
a
book
took
place
impacted
its
plot.
Although
Mrs.
Bair
was
not
a
particularly
challenging
teacher
in
terms
of
her
grading,
her
more
creative
approach
to
homework
assignments
trained
me
to
take
a
creative
approach
to
my
writing
in
general.
In
classes
since
Mrs.
BairOs,
in
which
more
standard
essays
have
been
assigned,
I
have,
in
large
part
due
Mrs.
BairOs
training,
approached
the
conventional
questions
in
more
creative
ways,
allowing
me
to
both
enjoy
writing
the
paper
more
and
to
write
more
interesting
and
complex
papers.
Mrs.
Bair,
therefore,
allowed
writing
to
be
framed,
once
again,
not
as
a
mere
inconvenience,
but
as
an
exercise
in
creativity
that
could
prove
quite
enjoyable.
The
following
year,
I
had
two
more
teachers
that
were
critical
to
my
development
as
a
writer.
The
first
of
these
teachers
was
Mrs.
Hornstein,
my
A.P.
United
States
History
teacher.
Although
she
was
not
an
English
teacher,
she
graded
papers
more
harshly
than
any
of
my
other
high
school
teachers.
She
was
instrumental
in
teaching
me
how
to
write,
not
for
the
sake
of
writing,
but
for
the
sake
of
conveying
specific
information.
She
taught
me
to
utilize
the
writing
skills
that
I
possessed,
not
for
show,
but
for
a
particular
purpose,
a
skill
that
has
proven
invaluable
to
me
since
then,
in
classes,
summer
jobs,
and
a
number
of
other
areas
of
my
life.
Eleventh
grade
was
also
the
first
year
I
had
Dr.
Jacobson
as
an
English
teacher
(I
also
had
him
in
twelfth
grade).
My
first
year
with
Dr.
Jacobson
was
his
first
year
as
a
high
school
teacher
(he
had
previously
been
a
college
professor),
and
he
treated
our
class
in
much
the
same
way
he
was
accustomed
to
treating
his
college
students.
He
gave
us
broad
instructions
for
all
assignments
and
allowed
us
to
take
them
in
any
direction
we
chose.
As
a
result,
I
was
able
to
experiment
with
my
writing
and
work
on
the
aspects
of
it
I
felt
I
needed
to.
In
addition,
he
saw
that
writing
was
something
I
enjoyed
and
was
willing
to
put
a
considerable
amount
of
time
and
effort
into,
and
he
truly
challenged
me
to
write
to
the
best
of
my
abilities.
When
he
would
have
let
other
students
get
away
with
a
sub-par
paper,
he
forced
me
to
rewrite
it;
when
he
saw
that
I
had
written
a
good
paper,
he
helped
me
see
where
I
could
make
it
better.
It
was
largely
due
to
my
two
years
with
Dr.
Jacobson
that
I
felt
adequately
prepared
for
college,
and
at
least
as
far
as
my
writing
skills
were
concerned,
I
was
not
terribly
nervous
about
making
the
transition.
I
knew
that
I
was
a
decent
writer
and
was
able
to
express
myself
well
through
my
words.
Once
I
arrived
at
college,
I
found
this
to
be
more
or
less
the
case.
Although
my
first
English
paper
earned
a
less-than-stellar
grade,
after
meeting
with
my
professor,
I
was
able
to
quickly
learn
the
adjustments
I
had
to
make
(which
were
primarily
concerned
with
the
content
and
complexity
of
my
paper,
not
in
the
writing
itself),
and
I
have
since
had
little
difficulty
adjusting
to
college
level
writing.
I
also
found
that
being
a
good
writer
proved
an
invaluable
asset
in
my
non-English
courses,
as
being
able
to
express
myself
well
through
writing
made
it
a
far
easier
task
to
earn
good
grades
in
content-based
classes
(It
is,
after
all,
much
easier
to
demonstrate
an
understanding
of
a
subject
if
one
can
express
that
understanding
clearly).
As
a
result,
I
am
extremely
grateful
to
the
teachers
who
helped
shape
me
into
a
competent
writer,
and
especially
to
those
who
helped
me
view
writing
as
fun
(I
quickly
learned
that
writing
was
an
integral
part
of
the
college
experience,
and
that
I
was
going
to
spend
many
hours
over
the
next
four
years
doing
it;
it
is
a
great
advantage,
therefore,
that
I
enjoy
it).
Reflecting
upon
my
career
thus
far
as
a
writer,
it
is
evident
that
it
is
only
due
to
the
encouragement
and
contributions
of
my
teachers
and
family
that
I
have
been
able
to
develop
a
love
of
and
proficiency
in
writing.
Without
my
motherOs
help
in
documenting
my
trip
to
the
hair
salon
as
a
four-year-old
and
support
in
Nplaying
real
student,O
it
is
highly
doubtful
that
I
could
have
developed
the
relationship
with
writing
I
now
enjoy.
Similarly,
had
it
not
been
for
a
number
of
teachers,
from
Miss
Vanderwall
in
first
grade
to
Dr.
Jacobson
in
twelfth,
who
helped
me
view
writing
as
an
enjoyable
activity,
who
challenged
me
to
better
myself
as
a
writer,
and
who
encouraged
me
and
praised
my
work,
my
literacy
narrative
would
doubtless
read
much
differently.
Although
I
do
not
know
how
the
literacy
narratives
of
the
other
students
at
Lafayette
would
read,
as
a
Writing
Associate,
I
can
hope
to
become
a
small
part
of
those
narratives,
providing
other
students
the
same
type
of
encouragement
and
assistance
that
I
have
received
over
the
years.
