My
History
As
a
Writer
August
23,
1995
When
are
you
going
to
write
that
best-selling
novel?
is
one
of
my
mother's
favorite
questions.
Years
ago-younger
and
much
more
naive-I
had
declared
my
intention
to
author
a
best-selling
novel,
become
rich
and
famous,
and
provide
her
with
every
luxury
she
could
ever
want.
Today
I
look
back
at
that
innocent
optimism
and
remember
my
beginning
literary
endeavors
of
the
first
grade.
I
recall
working
on
an
assignment
to
write
a
story;
while
some
finished
theirs
in
two
or
three
pages,
I
went
back
for
piece
after
piece
of
that
grayish,
speckled
paper
that
ran
horizontally
and
had
the
dotted
blue
lines.
I
filled
ten
pages
with
my
sprawling
awkward
handwriting,
becoming
engrossed
in
my
story
and
the
characters.
I
no
longer
remember
what
that
story
was
about,
but
writing
it
made
me
realize
how
much
I
enjoyed
creating
imaginary
people
and
situations.
I
think
of
the
first
few
years
of
elementary
school
as
the
story
writing
years.
This
work
encouraged
the
use
of
our
imaginations
and
developed
our
creativity.
I
grew
to
love
writing
these
fictitious
pieces,
and
would
even
write
outside
of
class,
creating
stories
about
the
exploits
of
my
aunt's
golden
retriever,
Megan.
One
story
that
I
wrote
in
the
third
grade
so
impressed
my
teacher
that
I
was
told
to
read
it
to
another
class,
and
the
story
was
published
by
one
of
the
teachers
and
added
to
his
collection
of
student
stories.
I
used
pencil
during
these
early
years
of
my
writing,
mostly
due
to
the
fact
that
I
was
still
learning
and
prone
to
make
more
mistakes.
At
some
point,
I
switched
to
using
pens;
they
were
smoother,
and
the
words
just
seemed
to
glide
across
the
page.
I
could
write
faster
with
a
pen;
it
was
almost
as
if
ideas
flowed
more
quickly
from
my
head
to
the
paper
when
using
one.
Pencils
needed
too
much
pressure
and
seemed
to
hinder
my
thought
process.
In
the
fifth
grade,
we
were
required
to
write
in
journals
every
week,
which
was
a
new
writing
experience
for
me.
I
had
written
occasionally
in
a
diary
for
a
few
years,
but
now
in
addition
to
personal
events,
we
wrote
about
what
went
on
in
class,
or
our
feelings
concerning
what
we
read.
The
teacher
would
write
comments
in
our
journals,
and
it
made
the
relationship
with
her
seem
much
more
personal
and
individual.
It
was
also
in
the
fifth
grade
that
I
started
doing
some
of
my
writing
on
a
computer.
At
first
I
used
the
computer
only
occasionally;
it
was
still
new
to
me,
and
pen
and
paper
were
more
comfortable.
The
workings
of
a
word
processor
were
confusing
as
well,
and
I
often
resorted
to
writing
on
paper.
The
sixth
grade
was
an
important
year
in
the
history
of
my
writing.
In
language
arts
we
began
to
veer
from
the
story
writing
to
write
a
research
type
paper,
the
first
one
I
recall
writing.
We
each
chose
a
different
country
to
research;
I
remember
mine
was
Mexico.
In
my
mind,
the
preparation
for
it
seemed
quite
elaborate;
we
had
to
first
write
many
notes
and
produce
a
detailed
outline
of
what
we
planned
to
do.
This
was
quite
a
change
for
me,
when
I
was
accustomed
to
simply
sitting
down
and
writing
a
story
without
much
forethought.
We
were
given
set
topics
we
had
to
cover,
and
a
certain
order
in
which
to
present
them.
This
factual
writing
was
different
than
what
I
was
used
to,
but
not
altogether
unpleasant.
I
still
preferred
writing
stories
though,
and
it
was
one
of
these
written
that
year
which
attracted
so
much
attention.
We
were
given
an
array
of
pictures
from
which
to
choose
and
then
had
to
develop
a
story
from
one.
The
picture
I
chose
displayed
a
bedroom,
the
focus
of
which
was
the
wallpaper.
It
was
covered
with
white
birds,
and
one
of
the
birds
was
coming
off
of
the
wall.
I
entitled
my
story
The
Third
Floor
Bedroom
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
putting
it
together.
It
was
more
intricate
than
any
of
my
other
stories;
it
required
more
character
development
and
a
more
involved
plot.
My
teacher,
Miss
Shotwell,
was
very
impressed
by
the
story
and
her
reaction
to
it
was
an
important
factor
in
my
future
writing.
She
said
that
I
wrote
far
beyond
my
years
and
at
the
time,
I
didn't
think
anything
special
of
my
writing.
Her
reaction
was
the
first
really
positive
one
that
started
me
thinking
more
seriously
about
my
writing
ability.
She
suggested
adding
to
my
story
to
make
it
a
more
substantial
piece
of
work,
and
I
had
visions
of
making
it
a
novel.
I
actually
worked
on
it
off
an
on
for
about
three
years,
but
never
could
decide
on
what
I
wanted
to
say.
I
hadn't
realized
how
difficult
writing
a
large
piece
of
work
could
be.
Miss
Shotwell
also
showed
her
confidence
in
my
writing
by
asking
me
to
be
a
dramaturge
for
the
play
our
class
was
performing,
Shakespeare's
A
Comedy
of
Errors.
I
had
never
heard
of
the
word
before,
and
she
had
to
explain
its
meaning
to
me.
She
wanted
me
to
write
a
small
prologue
to
the
play
so
that
the
other
students
who
watched
the
performance
would
have
some
background
as
to
what
was
occurring.
Most
of
us
had
not
yet
been
introduced
to
Shakespeare
at
that
time,
and
the
play
certainly
became
confusing
at
some
points.
To
be
honest,
I
was
not
completely
comfortable
with
her
trust
in
my
ability.
I
thought,
what
if
what
I
write
isn't
level
with
her
expectations?
Actually,
the
whole
rest
of
that
year
was
affected
by
her
reaction
to
my
Third
Floor
Bedroom
story.
I
felt
an
enormous
amount
of
pressure
to
be
the
best,
and
to
perform
at
a
higher
level.
I
almost
wished
I
hadn't
written
the
story;
it
was
much
easier
not
being
distinct
from
the
rest
of
my
classmates.
Every
single
piece
of
writing
I
produced
the
rest
of
the
year
had
me
biting
my
finger
nails,
hoping
it
was
good
enough.
I
was
so
afraid
to
be
less
than
she
believed
my
ability
to
be,
and
figured
her
first
impressions
had
been
mistaken.
My
relationship
with
Miss
Shotwell
continued
after
I
left
her
class;
we
wrote
back
and
forth
several
times,
and
she
even
sent
me
a
list
of
publishers
for
children's
work.
Unfortunately,
I
never
had
enough
perseverance
or
dedication
to
keep
with
my
stories,
and
simply
concentrated
on
school
writing.
During
this
time,
I
also
attempted
to
write
some
poetry
outside
of
class.
After
dreaming
at
night,
I
would
sometimes
wake
up
with
an
idea
for
a
poem,
and
so
kept
a
notebook
and
pen
by
my
bed
for
fear
of
losing
the
idea
by
morning.
Writing
the
poetry
gave
me
a
good
feeling,
and
I
would
often
show
it
to
my
mother
or
other
members
of
my
family.
Occasionally,
I
would
give
poems
as
gifts
to
them.
When
I
amassed
a
fair
number,
I
copied
the
poems
into
a
covered
book,
gleaning
satisfaction
from
my
own
collection
of
poetry.
One
event,
however,
cured
me
of
wanting
to
share
my
poetry
with
others.
When
I
was
12,
my
grandmother
happened
upon
one
of
my
poems
that
was
about
someone
committing
suicide.
She
became
concerned
and
showed
the
poem
to
my
mother,
who
thought
I
was
suicidal.
This
was
not
the
case;
I
suppose
I
was
simply
in
a
morbid
or
depressed
mood.
In
order
not
to
be
misinterpreted
again,
I
started
to
keep
my
writing
to
myself
and
to
dislike
presenting
it
to
others.
With
the
start
of
junior
high
school,
changes
occurred
in
how
and
where
we
were
expected
to
write.
Instead
of
writing
only
in
English
class,
I
was
writing
in
history,
science,
and
a
class
called
reading.
In
English,
the
paragraph
was
officially
introduced
to
me,
and
such
words
as
topic
sentence,
and
supporting
ideas.
Writing
became
much
more
structured
and
controlled-something
I
had
to
pay
more
attention
to.
I
learned
how
to
write
comparison
and
contrast
papers,
and
how
to
support
an
opinion
with
facts.
In
reading
class,
I
gained
experience
writing
book
reports,
which
included
looking
more
closely
at
characters
and
plots,
and
the
purpose
of
how
the
author
presented
the
story.
In
these
subjects,
writing
steered
away
from
creative
and
more
toward
analytical.
In
history
and
science,
the
writing
consisted
basically
of
a
retelling
of
facts,
which
I
had
been
exposed
to
in
elementary
school,
and
for
me,
it
didn't
represent
much
of
a
challenge.
I
preferred
the
writing
done
in
English
and
reading
because
it
involved
more
thinking
and
more
skill.
My
last
year
of
junior
high
school,
ninth
grade,
was
the
most
revolutionary
in
terms
of
writing.
First
of
all,
it
was
an
honors
class,
which
was
a
bit
intimidating,
and
second
of
all,
the
whole
process
of
writing
changed
dramatically.
The
notion
of
pre-writing
was
introduced,
something
I
had
rarely
done,
and
words
such
as
rhythm,
sentence
variety,
and
flow.
My
wonderful
teacher,
Mrs.
Eckles,
encouraged
us
to
use
clustering
as
a
prewriting
method.
We
would
have
a
main
idea
in
mind,
and
then
write
down
words
that
branched
out
from
that
starting
point.
In
this
respect,
writing
became
much
more
technical
and
structured
for
me.
Worrying
about
rhythm-making
certain
I
had
long
sentences
next
to
short
ones,
interspersed
with
medium
length
sentences-drove
me
crazy.
I
disliked
examining
the
structure
of
my
sentences
to
ensure
I
had
a
good
mixture
of
complex
and
simple.
During
that
time,
writing
became
something
tedious
and
no
longer
so
enjoyable.
As
time
went
on,
I
assimilated
these
aspects
into
my
writing,
and
they
no
longer
required
such
an
effort.
Later
in
that
year,
the
five
paragraph
theme
was
introduced,
which
has
become
the
basis
for
every
piece
of
writing
I
have
done
since
then-introduction,
three
body
paragraphs,
and
a
conclusion.
It
was
definitely
a
novelty
and
fairly
daunting,
as
I
was
used
to
writing
single
paragraphs.
Here
was
even
more
structure
and
more
rules
to
govern
my
writing.
However,
I
grew
to
appreciate
the
theme
and
understand
it
as
a
method
to
communicate
an
attitude
or
opinion
in
a
logical
and
precise
manner.
And
eventually,
the
tedious
and
structured
feeling
began
to
ebb
as
I
grew
more
accustomed
to
writing
themes.
Although
it
was
governed
by
strict
rules
at
first
(general
statement
opening,
statement
of
thesis,
statement
of
development
points,
transition
statement,
etc.),
familiarity
with
the
form
allowed
for
some
liberties
to
be
taken,
and
I
ceased
to
feel
so
boxed
in
by
the
theme.
For
example,
I
began
to
write
more
creative
and
less
stiff
introductions
and
felt
more
confidence
in
breaking
from
the
traditional.
When
I
began
high
school,
I
started
to
use
the
theme
in
other
classes
besides
English;
I
would
use
it
to
write
essays
for
exams,
which
pleased
my
world
cultures
teacher
immensely.
The
theme
was
like
a
portal
to
a
whole
new
world
of
writing
without
which
I
cannot
imagine
surviving
in
a
college
course
today.
Making
the
transition
to
high
school
was
an
easy
one,
due
to
my
previous
experience
with
theme
writing
the
year
before.
In
English
class,
the
concentration
shifted
from
perfecting
the
form
of
the
paper
to
perfecting
style
and
creating
a
finished
product.
The
right
word
usage
was
emphasized,
and
so
we
were
discouraged
from
using
to
be
verbs
or
passive
voice.
This
was
somewhat
of
an
unpleasant
restriction,
though
I'm
sure
it
improved
our
essays.
My
most
memorable
writing
experience
during
high
school
occurred
in
the
twelfth
grade.
There
was
an
essay
contest
for
Law
Day,
and
one
of
my
teachers
suggested
I
enter.
I
was
reluctant,
because
I
feared
not
doing
well.
Despite
every
English
teacher
I
had
had
telling
me
I
write
well,
I
still
had
limited
confidence
in
my
own
writing.
However,
I
felt
inspired
one
day
and
decided
to
write
the
essay
anyway,
telling
myself
the
judges'
opinions
didn't
matter.
I
submitted
it,
and
discovered
later
(to
my
enormous
surprise)
that
I
had
won
first
place
in
the
county.
It
was
an
important
event
because
it
gave
me
a
little
more
assurance
and
confidence
in
my
writing,
something
which
I
needed
desperately.
It
also
made
me
feel
more
secure
about
entering
college.
When
I
came
to
Lafayette,
I
did
still
have
fears
about
what
was
expected
in
college
writing.
I
had
concerns
that
the
quality
of
my
vocabulary
was
not
good
enough
and
that
I
would
not
be
able
to
produce
complex
theses.
However,
I
knew
I
had
gained
a
solid
background
in
high
school.
I
believed
that
I
was
adequately
prepared
for
the
level
of
writing
expected
here.
However,
my
first
year
seminar
was
a
bit
of
a
wake-up
call.
Maybe
I
had
become
too
confident;
this
class
showed
me
that
I
still
had
a
lot
to
learn,
and
that
I
would
have
to
make
more
changes
in
the
way
I
wrote.
I
began
to
make
those
changes
in
that
course,
and
carried
them
over
to
my
English
class
last
semester.
I
have
become
an
avid
fan
of
pre-writing,
more
specifically
free-writing.
I
have
learned
that
revision
is
a
necessary
stage
of
writing,
and
I
have
also
learned
to
be
more
precise
in
word
choice
and
to
incorporate
conceptual
precision
as
well.
Looking
back
on
my
growth
in
literacy
over
the
years,
I
see
that
sometimes
that
growth
occurred
in
inches,
and
at
other
times
I
advanced
by
miles.
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I
went
backwards,
and
then
had
to
catch
up.
I
see
how
far
I've
come
from
my
stories
of
elementary
school
to
the
academic
writing
of
today.
And
at
times
I
wish
I
could
recapture
some
aspects
of
that
early
writing-some
of
the
innocence,
some
of
the
naivete
that
allowed
me
to
say,
I'm
going
to
write
a
best-selling
novel.
When
I
can't
think
of
the
right
words,
or
don't
know
exactly
how
to
phrase
my
thoughts,
writing
becomes
one
of
the
most
difficult
and
frustrating
acts
I've
ever
attempted.
But
when
I'm
inspired
and
my
thoughts
are
transformed
into
words
that
truly
communicate
what
I
want
to
express,
writing
has
the
power
to
give
me
the
greatest
satisfaction
I've
ever
experienced.
