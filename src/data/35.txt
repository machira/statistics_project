WA
Project
for
Workshop
Professor
Donahue
The
Mid-August
assignment
of
the
WA
Project
to
describe
My
History
as
a
Writer
happened
to
coincide
with
the
annual
summer
cleaning
of
my
closet.
As
I
sorted
through
various
school
papers
from
elementary
school
through
high
school,
I
reflected
upon
various
experiences
which
have
shaped
my
ability
to
write.
Certain
assignments
and
teachers
were
already
vivid
in
my
mind
Other
memories
were
retrieved
as
I
reviewed
my
papers
now
from
the
standpoint
of
a
college
sophomore.
My
writing
obviously
has
matured
over
the
years,
thanks
to
the
guidance
of
an
assortment
of
teachers
and
professors
and
to
the
criticism
and
praise
of
peers
and
relatives.
Throughout
my
education
I
have
learned
the
specific
aspects
of
writing
such
as
word
choice
and
sentence
structure
and
the
broad
topics
like
style,
tone,
and
focus.
As
a
result
of
my
past
experiences,
I
have
developed
a
personal
approach
to
writing
that
takes
into
account
the
conditions
under
which
I
write,
the
various
drafts
I
compose,
and
the
writing
implements
I
use.
For
me
the
experience
of
becoming
a
writer
is
a
continuous
process.
As
a
college
sophomore
my
writing
is
constantly
being
shaped
and
will
continue
to
develop
as
a
result
of
additional
reading
and
writing
assigned
this
academic
year.
The
earliest
memory
I
have
of
writing
in
a
classroom
setting
dates
back
to
1984,
when
I
was
in
third
grade.
I
clearly
remember
writing
one
page
research
papers
on
three
separate
topics:
the
Navajo
Indians,
the
butterfly,
and
the
helicopter.
Each
paper
was
mounted
on
a
large
piece
of
construction
paper
alongside
an
illustration
which
was
probably
as
elementary
as
my
composition.
Approval
and
praise
were
demonstrated
as
the
teacher
displayed
our
masterpieces
on
the
wall
outside
of
the
classroom
Surely
if
one
searched
my
attic
after
all
these
years
he/she
would
come
across
these
papers
for
my
work
has
always
been
valued
and
preserved
by
both
my
parents
and
me.
Another
memorable
experience
from
that
year
was
the
writing
of
a
book
called
The
Missing
Circus
Animals.
The
creation
of
this
book
was
a
collaborative
effort
on
the
part
of
three
of
my
best
friends
and
me.
Each
group
of
student
writers
was
instructed
to
write
a
fictional
story
in
any
genre,
once
again
complete
with
illustrations.
The
book
included
a
hard
front
cover,
a
title
page,
and
a
page
about
the
authors.
We
students
then
invited
parents
and
friends
to
the
annual
book
fair
for
third
and
fourth
graders
held
in
our
gymnasium.
Compliments
were
both
verbal
and
written,
as
guests
were
able
to
send
students
a
note
of
praise.
At
this
point
in
my
writing
career,
I
received
very
little
criticism.
Most
comments
at
this
stage
were
complimentary
and
served
as
encouragement
and
incentive
to
pursue
writing.
Toward
the
end
of
elementary
school
I
chose
to
write
poetry
and
a
few
short
stories
on
my
own,
some
of
which
I
found
as
I
cleaned
my
closet
Many
of
the
subjects
of
the
poetry
were
tangible
concepts,
such
as
the
phone
and
chocolate.
Every
two
lines
had
to
rhyme,
even
if
an
awkward
sounding
sentence
was
produced.
Although
reading
these
poems
caused
me
to
laugh,
I
can
see
the
beginning
of
my
style
of
writing.
With
each
final
copy
in
a
fourth
graders
neatest
handwriting
was
a
first
preliminary
draft
In
one
poem
I
even
notice
an
imitation
of
the
poetry
of
David
McCord,
a
children's
writer
we
studied
in
the
fourth
grade.
Through
middle
school
and
until
high
school
I
continued
to
write
poetry
for
pleasure
although
the
topics
became
more
abstract,
dealing
with
emotions
and
metaphors
for
life
experiences.
Probably
due
to
lack
of
time,
I
stopped
writing
on
my
own
as
I
entered
high
school.
I
therefore
produced
less
creative,
imaginative
pieces
and
more
of
the
assigned
research
papers.
I
approach
writing
that
is
independent
of
school
assignments
and
of
required
writing
with
very
little
anxiety.
Once
I
know
that
a
work
will
be
analyzed
and
assigned
a
value
with
a
letter
grade,
a
greater
burden
is
placed
on
me
as
a
writer,
one
that
includes
taking
the
reader
into
consideration.
Surely
the
worst
experience
I
had
as
a
writer
stemmed
from
the
anxiety
I
suffered
as
I
wrote
my
essays
to
be
included
with
my
college
applications.
I
recall
spending
hours
agonizing
over
simple
word
choices.
Knowing
that
my
future
partly
depended
upon
a
piece
of
my
writing
was
not
a
comforting
thought.
The
inevitable
criticism
from
teachers
is
valuable
in
the
development
of
a
writer,
but
can
also
be
met
by
the
writer
with
feelings
of
resentment.
The
thought
of
such
criticism
and
possible
failure
can
be
a
hindrance
if
a
writer
(like
myself)
is
easily
stressed
by
the
initial
assignment
of
a
paper.
I
am
certain
that
I
composed
a
variety
of
research
papers
and
creative
writing
during
my
middle
school
years.
However
it
was
during
high
school
that
I
learned
to
analyze
various
types
of
literature
and
compose
critical
essays
and
extensive
research
papers,
gradually
preparing
myself
to
write
at
a
college
level.
During
my
freshman
and
junior
years
of
high
school
I
had
what
I
now
consider
to
be
a
fortunate
experience.
I
had
the
same
teacher
for
English
both
of
these
years.
During
ninth
grade
I
learned
how
to
successfully
construct
a
paper
on
a
novel
incorporating
specific
examples
from
the
text.
The
teacher
instructed
us
to
select
a
minimum
of
three
examples
to
support
each
argument
In
high
school
we
were
repeatedly
taught
to
confine
our
thesis
statement
to
one
sentence
and
to
place
it
at
the
very
end
of
the
introductory
paragraph.
I
now
find
it
difficult
to
proceed
in
a
different
manner.
I
recall
writing
essays
on
a
variety
of
novels,
specifically
The
Canterbury
Tales
and
Romeo
and
Juliet.
I
learned
to
analyze
various
characters
and
finally
was
able
to
commit
these
observations
to
paper.
Terms
foreign
to
me
such
as
tragic
hero
and
thesis
statement
became
familiar
during
my
first
year
of
high
school.
During
my
sophomore
year
of
high
school
I
most
clearly
remember
learning
to
write
a
persuasive
essay.
From
researching
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
death
penalty,
I
formed
an
argument
against
capital
punishment
in
one
paper.
Again
we
were
taught
to
choose
three
justifications
to
support
our
argument
This
paper
included
a
concession
paragraph
where
I
noted
the
opposing
side
of
the
issue.
I
then
continued
to
state
my
case
drawing
upon
specific
facts
I
had
encountered
during
the
research.
Although
I
have
not
had
to
write
a
persuasive
essay
since
that
time,
I
value
the
experience
I
gained
from
researching
and
learning
to
organize
and
focus
my
ideas.
The
most
beneficial
experience
I
have
had
to
date
occurred
in
the
eleventh
grade.
Although
we
learned
about
various
authors
from
Milton
to
Yeats
during
this
academic
year,
the
basis
for
the
course
was
an
extensive,
year-long
assignment
to
construct
a
critical
paper
on
the
specific
literary
characteristics
of
a
particular
author.
The
author's
personal
biography
was
no
longer
of
importance
as
it
had
been
in
pervious
years;
instead
we
were
to
focus
upon
his/her
significant
contributions
to
literature.
Various
deadlines
throughout
the
academic
year
forced
each
student
to
produce
note
cards,
outlines,
a
thesis
statement,
and
numerous
drafts.
I
chose
to
analyze
William
Wordsworth's
numerous
references
to
nature
in
his
poetry.
I
read
not
only
his
works
of
poetry,
but
other
author's
criticisms
of
these
works.
While
noting
other
authors'
remarks,
I
learned
a
great
deal
about
documentation
within
the
body
of
a
lengthy
paper.
These
critical
essays
along
with
my
own
observations
allowed
me
to
construct
a
twenty
page
paper
on
The
Interaction
of
Man
and
Nature
in
William
Wordsworth's
Poetry.
At
the
end
of
the
year
we
had
to
submit
a
folder
with
three
sets
of
note
cards,
a
revised
thesis
statement
and
outline,
drafts
of
the
paper,
and
a
final
copy.
Passing
in
this
project
signified
the
completion
of
a
year-long
process
of
learning
to
write
a
coherent,
structured,
meaningful
paper.
Writing
the
paper
on
Wordsworth
facilitated
the
writing
of
a
similar
paper
on
Kate
Chopin,
the
author
of
The
Awakening,
for
my
Advanced
Placement
English
Class
the
following
year.
Although
I
did
not
follow
the
exact
procedure
introduced
the
previous
year,
the
experience
I
had
my
junior
year
was
the
basis
for
the
writing
of
the
second
paper
of
this
type.
Had
I
not
been
guided
in
such
an
exacting
manner
at
a
high
school
level,
I
would
have
been
at
a
loss
during
my
first
year
of
college.
During
my
last
year
of
high
school,
I
learned
how
to
write
a
more
refined
paper
that
focused
on
one
aspect
of
a
short
story
or
poem.
Because
I
often
have
many
valid
but
distinct
points
to
discuss,
this
type
of
writing
has
always
been
a
challenge
for
me.
I
tend
to
provide
examples
and
observations
that
are
not
necessary
to
support
my
conclusion.
I
recall
writing
and
rewriting
one
such
paper
on
I
Stand
Here
Ironing
by
Tillie
Olsen.
Although
I
tried
to
focus
on
the
meaning
of
the
act
of
ironing
within
the
story,
my
thoughts
often
drifted
to
other
aspects
of
the
story.
Finally,
with
the
guidance
of
my
older
brother,
I
learned
to
eliminate
what
was
irrelevant
to
my
argument.
Having
been
exposed
to
various
styles
of
writing
throughout
high
school,
I
found
I
was
prepared
to
write
at
the
college
level.
The
three
papers
I
was
required
to
write
for
my
First
Year
Seminar
resembled
compositions
I
would
have
been
required
to
write
in
high
school.
I
was
surprised
to
learn
there
were
many
students
who
had
never
been
exposed
to
this
type
of
assignment
After
receiving
my
first
graded
paper
where
the
professor
noted
a
divided
focus,
the
notion
that
the
process
of
becoming
a
skillful
writer
is
an
ongoing
one
was
reaffirmed.
Once
again
my
interpretations
of
the
novel
caused
me
to
stray
in
two
separate
directions.
During
the
first
semester
I
had
the
intimidating
experience
of
being
placed
in
a
law
class
consisting
of
all
upperclassmen.
By
the
end
of
the
semester
I
had
completed
a
difficult
paper
on
the
relationship
between
the
writing
of
Franz
Kafka
and
the
profession
of
law.
I
relied
on
the
foundation
I
had
gained
from
writing
the
Wordsworth
and
Chopin
papers
in
high
school
to
compose
this
paper.
Had
I
not
proceeded
in
a
logical
manner
from
gathering
examples
to
using
an
outline,
this
paper
would
not
have
been
a
successful
one.
Twenty
percent
of
the
grade
in
my
second
semester
English
course
was
based
upon
three
journal
entries
per
week.
The
topic
for
these
journal
was
any
aspect
of
the
reading
for
that
particular
day.
These
entries
forced
me
to
analyze
the
reading
more
closely.
Since
the
writing
could
be
in
the
form
of
a
rough
first
draft,
I
found
it
easy
to
write
freely.
The
degree
to
which
a
student
gained
from
this
assignment
was
a
direct
result
of
the
amount
of
effort
he/she
devoted
to
the
journal.
Due
to
my
experiences
from
third
grade
to
high
school
I
brought
to
my
First
Year
Seminar
and
law
assignments
an
established
approach
to
writing.
Generally
papers
are
assigned
far
enough
in
advance
to
allow
for
brainstorming,
not
to
mention
the
build
up
of
a
bit
of
stress
or
apprehension.
In
general
I
compose
an
informal
outline,
more
like
pages
of
notes
in
some
sort
of
order.
Often
these
pages
include
examples
from
text
or
quotes
from
critical
essays.
When
writing
the
actual
paper
I
usually
sit
on
the
floor
surrounded
by
papers
strewn
about
the
room.
I
attempt
to
write
the
majority
of
a
paper
in
one
sitting.
The
writing
of
the
first
draft
is
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
writing
process
for
me.
I
am
often
stumped
as
to
how
to
begin
a
section
or
how
to
organize
my
thoughts.
Because
this
preliminary
step
is
often
lengthy
and
frustrating,
I
often
experience
a
sense
of
relief
as
I
transfer
the
first
draft
to
the
computer.
After
printing
out
several
copies,
I
revise
and
rewrite,
paying
attention
to
focus
and
the
organization
of
ideas
and
then
later
to
grammar.
Because
I
know
what
I
am
attempting
to
express,
I
often
have
a
difficult
time
spotting
my
own
errors.
Therefore
I
usually
ask
an
outsider
for
his/her
opinions
before
printing
out
the
final
copy.
As
a
result
of
the
pieces
I
have
read
and
written,
the
lessons
I
have
learned
from
teachers,
and
the
recognition,
encouragement,
and
criticism
I
have
received,
I
have
developed
many
attitudes
toward
writing
in
general
and
to
the
actual
process
of
writing.
These
attitudes
are
not
static;
they
are
likely
to
change
a
great
deal
even
in
this
upcoming
academic
year.
Certainly
as
I
clean
my
closet
next
summer
and
uncover
the
papers
from
my
freshman
year
I
will
note
the
changes
in
the
maturity
and
style
of
the
writer
who
composed
them
only
a
year
earlier.
