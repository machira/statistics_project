WA
summer
assignment

A
Personal
Touch...
How
many
different
ways
can
I
start
this
paper?
I
need
a
good
intro
that
captivates
the
audience--
something
that
flirts
with
the
reader.
Well,
I
could
start
with
a
quote.
Maybe
I
can
dig
up
a
good
one
and
expand
upon
it.
No,
I
don't
think
that
will
work
very
well
in
this
paper.
I
need
something
different,
which
will
stand
out
in
the
reader's
mind.
Perhaps
I
could
start
with
an
introductory
paragraph
that
tells
of
how
I
chose
this
opening.
Yeah,
I
think
that
will
work.
Since
becoming
a
WA,
much
more
consideration
goes
into
my
writing.
As
I
so
casually
mention
the
word
"writing"
one
might
suspect
that
I
am
only
referring
to
the
final,
polished
paper,
but
a
much
deeper
meaning
is
intended.
The
writing
in
this
paper
began
when
I
first
read
the
assignment,
while
sitting
at
my
kitchen
table.
As
I
read,
I
began
to
develop
ideas
and
recall
experiences
that
I
might
use
in
my
paper;
then
I
had
to
eat,
so
the
assignment
when
away.
To
me,
writing
and
eating
are
very
much
the
same.
Just
as
food
is
set
before
me,
I
briefly
read
over
the
assignment.
As
the
odors
from
the
food
steam
up
to
my
face,
I
make
inferences
about
the
assignment
and
the
paper.
Then
I
start
to
cut
apart
my
meal,
in
the
same
manner
as
I
analyze
and
dissect
the
assignment.
At
the
last
minute,
I
begin
eating,
and
likewise,
begin
writing.
I
continue
writing
until
I
am
full-
or
at
least
the
paper
is
full-
then
for
desert.
Desert
is
the
perfect
completion
of
a
good
meal,
and
revision
and
polishing
is
the
perfect
desert
for
a
paper.
Just
as
the
gourmand
expects
fine
food,
the
reader
has
expectations
of
the
paper.
Harnessing
these
expectations,
is
where
I
have
evolved
the
most
in
my
writing
as
a
result
of
being
a
WA.
Being
a
WA,
I
read
papers
with
the
same
agenda
as
the
professor.
I
am
looking
for
certain
points
to
be
made
and
discussed
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
assignment.
In
this
respect,
I
have
very
similar
expectations
as
the
professor.
Only
when
these
expectations
are
bent,
or
even
broken,
do
the
truly
good
papers
emerge.
One
cannot
write
a
paper
that
totally
violates
every
aspiration
of
the
professor
and
the
assignment
and
expect
to
be
the
Shakespeare
of
his
or
her
FYS.
Expectations
must
be
broken
tastefully.
This
power
and
control
over
a
paper
is
not
easily
grasped,
and
I
will
recommend
it
only
to
the
writers
that
I
feel
won't
lose
control
and
composition.
Control
in
a
paper
is
what
I
strive
for
in
my
writing.
Ever
since
I
was
introduced
to
using
dialogue,
I
have
begun
to
see
the
control
a
writer
has
in
their
writing.
My
experiences
as
a
WA
have
confirmed
these
"new"
ideas.
Constantly
I
find
myself
suggesting
that
writers
take
their
assignments
and
twist
them
into
something
of
personal
interest.
If
the
writer
has
no
interest,
then
pretending
is
the
way
to
go.
Otherwise,
boring,
dry
assignments
will
make
us
all
go
nuts.
After
reading
22
boring
papers
about
a
boring
topic,
I
am
ready
to
go
out
of
my
mind.
But
to
quote
Shakespeare's
Henry
IV,
"When
they
seldom
come,
they
wished-for
come,
and
nothing
pleaseth
but
rare
accident."
When
I
get
a
paper
where
the
writer
has
not
simply
bowed
down
to
the
expectations
of
the
professor,
but
instead
has
stumbled
upon
the
boundaries
of
those
expectations,
then
I
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air.
These
kinds
of
papers
"wished-for
come,"
and
quickly
make
their
way
into
conversation
with
the
professor.
Now
I
must
be
sure
that
the
writer
has
not
gone
too
far,
but
far
enough.
"Far
enough"
is
the
goal
of
my
writing.
After
seeing
papers
rise
above
the
norm
because
the
writer
has
incorporated
reader
expectations,
I
now
strive
for
the
control
to
place
the
reader
in
the
writing.
By
doing
that,
the
reader
and
the
writer
share
ideas.
What
better
form
of
communication
than
that
found
in
a
fine,
savory
piece
of
writing,
where
thoughts
and
suggestions
are
exchanged
mutually
between
two
minds
sometimes
centuries
apart?
Not
that
I
think
my
writing
will
ever
reach
this
almost
psychic
state,
but
I
try
to
create
something
that
gives
a
breath
to
my
professor.
Surely
I
write
differently
when
I
think
that
my
paper
is
among
a
stack
of
others,
then
I
do
when
my
paper
is
alone.
I
must
consider
the
audience.
As
the
reader
of
this
paper
sits
and
reads,
he
or
she
probably
has
some
average
time
spent
reading
a
paper,
some
take
longer
than
others,
of
course.
When
the
last
page
of
this
paper
is
revealed,
a
hidden,
or
maybe
not-so-hidden
sigh
is
also
revealed.
But
all
in
due
time,
I
still
have
much
more
to
discuss-
I
eat
my
vegetable
first,
and
then
move
on
to
the
rest
of
my
meal.
For
a
writer
to
control
the
reader,
a
firm
grasp
of
grammar
is
necessary.
Without
good
grammar,
the
reader
is
distracted.
Many
times
I've
been
in
WA
conferences
where
the
writer
has
had
trouble
expressing
his
or
her
ideas.
Often
the
solution
is
as
easy
as
asking
the
writer
to
explain
the
idea,
and
then
jot
down
what
was
just
said.
I
recall
a
conference
that
I
had
this
past
semester
about
a
paper
that
I
now
regard
as
one
of
the
best
rough
drafts
I
have
ever
read.
In
this
draft,
the
ideas
were
jumbled,
sentences
were
fragmented,
and
just
about
every
rule
of
grammar
was
broken
somewhere
in
the
three-page
paper.
But
what
made
this
paper
so
interesting
were
the
ideas.
This
writer
had
the
freshest,
coolest
ideas
in
the
class.
As
I
read
the
paper,
which
took
a
while
due
to
the
grammar,
I
could
not
believe
how
shocked
I
was
by
the
ideas
it
presented.
There
is
always
one
conference
that
I
really
look
forward
to,
and
this
was
definitely
it.
As
the
conference
unfolded,
the
writer
and
I
organized
his
ideas
into
a
rough
order.
Then,
we
coupled
the
idea
further
into
paragraphs.
By
the
end
of
the
conference,
the
writer
walked
away
with
an
outline
and
confidence
that
the
paper
will
be
a
success.
This
writer
simply
needed
some
guidance
about
how
to
structure
his
ideas
into
a
paper.
Ever
since
that
day,
I
begin
writing
with
an
outline.
My
outlines
are
the
first
draft
of
my
paper.
They
map
out
the
ideas,
and
importantly
how
the
ideas
will
be
presented.
One
may
think
of
my
outlines
as
a
flow
chart
of
ideas
throughout
my
paper.
Without
a
map,
my
papers
seem
choppy
and
underdeveloped.
I
have
come
to
realize
how
important
outlines
are.
If
I
am
in
a
conference
where
the
writer
is
unsure
of
his
or
her
writing,
I
immediately
begin
questions
that
lead
to
the
construction
of
an
outline.
An
outline
is
the
skeleton
of
the
paper;
it
gives
a
paper
structure.
Now
I
must
be
careful
when
as
I
talk
about
structure.
A
paper
may
be
structured
very
differently.
These
differences
in
structure
depend
on
the
style
of
the
writer.
Oftentimes,
when
I
have
conferences
with
first-year
students,
they
haven't
developed
an
academic
style
of
writing
yet.
To
help
accommodate
these
developing
styles,
I
try
to
offer
the
writer
many
different
ways
to
fit
the
ideas
together
into
an
acceptable
paper.
By
giving
these
suggestions,
I
find
myself
debating
how
to
structure
my
own
papers.
After
seeing
many
different
flavors
of
structure,
I
try
to
choose
the
structure
that
will
have
the
desired
effect
on
the
readers
of
my
works.
In
doing
this,
I
am
beginning
to
see
a
style
form
within
my
writing.
I
don't
think
I
would
have
noticed
the
style
of
my
writing
if
I
hadn't
been
looking
at
the
style
of
other
writers.
I
certainly
did
not
pay
attention
to
style
before
I
was
a
WA.
I
did
mention
that
I
must
be
careful
when
talking
about
structure
and
style.
I
have
caught
myself
pressing
my
style
onto
the
papers
I
read
as
a
WA.
Only
after
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
did
I
notice
this
dictatorship.
Now
I
let
the
writers
be
themselves.
I
merely
provide
a
crutch
for
their
writing.
While
reading
the
paper,
I
note
the
style.
In
the
conference,
I
discuss
the
style
of
the
paper
with
the
writer.
I
make
the
writer
aware
that
he
or
she
has
a
style,
and
I
point
out
some
details
found
in
that
style.
By
making
the
writer
aware,
he
or
she
may
then
chose
to
modify
their
style.
Now
there
is
a
difference
between
style
and
misinterpretation
of
the
assignment.
Above
all
the
writer
must
satisfy
the
reader,
namely
the
professor.
The
first
thing
that
takes
place
at
one
of
my
WA
conferences
is
a
brief
discussion
of
the
paper
and
the
professor's
expectations
of
the
paper.
Often,
after
hearing
my
explanation
of
the
assignment,
the
writer
has
a
better
understanding
of
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
their
argument
and
ultimately
of
their
paper.
With
this
new
understanding,
we
are
then
prepared
to
discuss
the
presentation
of
the
argument.
I
want
to
be
sure
to
note
that
a
firm
understanding
of
the
assignment
is
essential
to
a
solid
paper.
The
first
thing
that
I
do
is
to
go
through
an
assignment
and
underline
all
of
the
points.
By
underlining,
I
am
sure
that
I
haven't
missed
anything.
Also,
when
I
am
writing
a
paper
the
assignment
become
a
guide
to
keep
me
from
floating
off
track.
This
strategy
of
underlining
I
have
developed
during
WA
conferences.
I
need
to
keep
the
assignment
in
mind,
and
if
I
think
I
might
be
heading
offtrack,
a
simple
glance
sets
me
straight.
Without
a
firm
understanding
of
the
assignment,
control
of
the
paper
is
lost.
I
have
seen
some
very
well
written
papers
that
had
a
good
argument,
but
the
paper
does
not
begin
to
satisfy
the
question
posed
in
the
assignment.
How
can
a
writer
have
control
over
a
paper,
when
he
or
she
is
not
sure
what
the
paper
should
be
about?
When
writers
have
doubts
about
the
assignment,
then
poor
papers
result.
Oftentimes,
the
assignment
is
vague,
therefore,
the
students
are
very
unsure
of
themselves.
That's
where
I
step
in.
In
an
instance
such
as
this,
I
politely
confront
the
professor
and
make
them
aware
that
the
assignment
is
unclear.
I
also
do
this
in
my
own
writing.
If
I
am
ever
unsure
of
the
assignment,
I
immediately
go
to
the
professor.
I
have
seen
too
many
papers
have
to
be
rewritten
because
of
uncertainty
in
the
assignment.
So
I
guess
my
writing
has
changed
the
most
because
of
the
mistakes
I've
seen
other
writers
make.
Surely
I've
learned
from
the
good
writers,
but
it
is
sometimes
very
difficult
to
see
how
much
work
went
into
a
good
piece
of
writing.
As
I
watch
a
paper
develop,
I
think
of
how
my
papers
develop,
and
what
I
can
do
to
improve
my
writing.
Many
times
I
learn
from
first
year
students.
These
students
come
with
fresh
new
ideas
from
many
different
backgrounds,
and
I
get
to
work
with
those
ideas
before
academia
takes
its
toll.
The
hardest
part
then
is
for
myself
to
come
up
with
ideas
that
are
as
fresh
and
new
as
the
ideas
that
I
bump
into
in
my
WA
conferences.
In
this
paper,
though
I
find
it
hard
to
come
up
with
fresh
new
ideas.
I
have
tried
to
do
many
of
the
things
mentioned.
I
began
with
a
personalized
opening,
something
different
that
plays
a
little
with
my
reader.
Then,
I
went
into
the
discussion
of
the
paper.
I
discussed
the
details
that
I
think
make
for
a
good
paper
and
that
I
try
to
obtain.
Now
I
have
to
think
up
a
good
ending.
Perhaps
I
will
end
this
paper
much
like
I
began
it.
Because
this
paper
was
written
to
address
the
change
in
my
writing
since
becoming
a
WA,
it
is
appropriate
to
let
the
reader
flirt
a
bit
with
my
thoughts
as
I
write.
The
dilemma
that
I
now
face
is
the
closing
paragraph
of
this
paper.
In
this
kind
of
paper
being
personal
is
just
about
the
only
way
to
make
the
paper
more
interesting,
beside
perhaps
a
funny
story.
Well,
I
do
have
funny
stories,
but
none
that
are
applicable.
I
need
an
ending
that
is
emphatic,
yet
satisfying.
An
ending
that
reveals
what
I
believe
being
a
WA
is
all
about.
I
think
I
have
one...
To
err
is
to
be
human,
but
to
WA
is
to
learn.
