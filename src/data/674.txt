Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative.
Friday,
August
20,
2010.
I
clearly
remember
my
first
question
to
my
FYS
WA:
"What
are
you?
What
is
the
role
of
a
WA?!".
I
did
not
know
what
to
expect
because
until
then,
writing
has
mainly
meant
individual
research
work
with
minimal
input
from
an
outside
person.
However,
upon
coming
to
Lafayette
College,
I
was
flabbergasted
by
the
devotion
of
the
college's
writing
program
to
improve
its
student
writing
style
and
quality.
I
discovered
that
the
role
of
a
WA
was
to
prevent
the
dreaded
"writer's
block",
to
motivate
writing
by
imposing
multiple
deadlines,
to
proof
read
paragraphs
but
more
importantly,
WAs
help
their
students
think
outside
the
box.
Therefore,
with
this
extremely
positive
first
contact
with
a
program
that
contributed
constructive
feedback
about
my
work,
I
decided
to
apply
in
the
spring
of
my
freshman
year
to
become
a
Writing
Associate.
However,
upon
reading
that
I
was
assigned
a
class
and
was
joining
this
competent
team
in
the
following
semester,
I
started
to
question
my
ability
to
provide
new
student
writers
with
approaches
that
they
can
apply
to
their
own
writing
and
revision
process.
Indeed,
being
entrusted
with
the
objective
of
providing
strategies
to
help
student
with
larger
questions
of
structure,
organization,
style,
and
argument
as
well
as
with
the
smaller
issues
of
sentence
clarity
and
grammar
seemed
quite
daunting
when
my
only
writing
course
so
far
had
been
my
First-Year
seminar.
However,
during
the
course
of
the
first
introductory
Writing
Associate
workshop,
I
was
able
to
talk
with
student
colleagues
about
their
writing
and
thinking
process
and
ask
how
they
develop
their
analytical
skills,
stylistic
expertise
and
confidence
needed
for
a
successful
college
writing
experience.
Undeniably,
the
peer-based
aspect
of
the
program
fosters
an
atmosphere
where
the
numerous
interactions
with
other
writing
associates
helped
me
learn
how
to
evaluate
and
revise
my
writing;
improving
both
the
product
and
process.
Indeed,
during
one
of
the
mock
WA
conference,
I
was
relieved
to
learn
that
Cara,
a
rising
junior
at
that
time,
had
been
alternating
between
being
the
student
of
a
VAST
course
and
being
the
WA
of
another
VAST.
This
tidbit
of
information
made
me
aware
that
this
program
is
designed
to
develop
the
critical
thinking
of
the
writing
associate
such
that,
even
if
she
is
a
student
with
a
concentration
in
mathematics
or
art
history
or
engineering,
she
is
trained
to
read
and
craft
cogent
and
intellectually
challenging
questions
to
sharpen
and
clarify
her
students'
assignments.
Near
the
end
of
the
workshop,
I
was
excited
to
learn
that
my
partner
professor
was
William
Collins
and
that
I
was
assigned
to
the
same
FYS
that
I
had
taken.
Having
thoroughly
enjoyed
that
course,
[after
all,
this
class
led
to
my
first
contact
with
the
college's
writing
program]
I
was
looking
forward
to
discuss
writing
development
with
students
who
probably
shared
my
interest.
A
couple
of
days
into
the
semester,
I
met
with
Professor
Williams
to
discuss
how
we
were
going
to
approach
the
course.
With
a
notepad
resting
on
my
knees
and
a
pen
in
my
hand,
I
was
sitting
at
the
all-too-familiar
coffee
table
in
his
office
and
was
slightly
expecting
him
to
dictate
a
list
of
criteria
that
he
would
be
looking
for
in
his
students'
papers.
However,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
looking
relaxed,
he
asked:
"Laura,
since
you
very
recently
took
the
class;
I
would
appreciate
your
feedback
about
it.
Did
you
enjoy
the
course?
Did
it
provide
you
with
skills
that
you
could
also
apply
within
your
given
discipline?"
Pleasantly
surprised
that
he
was
seeking
pointers
from
a
student
whom
he
only
met
a
semester
ago,
I
seized
the
opportunity
to
develop
an
open
and
comfortable
WA-professor
partnership.
I
shared
with
him
that
I
benefitted
from
the
larger
emphasis
that
he
put
on
viewing
writing
as
a
process.
Indeed,
the
multiple
short
writing
assignments
not
only
broadened
the
fields
on
which
I
could
have
well-argued
discussions
but
also
allowed
me
to
"learn
through
writing".
They
made
me
understand
the
rigor
of
writing
within
a
discipline,
but
also
appreciate
the
flexibility
of
writing
beyond
the
college
classroom.
I
also
confided
that
his
"homework",
which
consisted
of
crafting
questions
about
the
essays
of
the
other
students
in
the
class,
helped
increase
my
confidence
to
employ
writing
as
a
tool
to
critically
assess
a
specific
assignment.
"In
effect,
I
have
always
considered
this
program
as
a
catalyst
for
student
writing
and
learning
since
it
eases
the
fear-related
obstacle
that
often
causes
too
many
students
to
stop
writing
too
soon"
replied
Professor
Collins.
"Is
there
any
aspect
of
the
course
that
was
confusing?
Every
year
I
work
with
the
WA
to
update
and
refresh
the
assignments"
he
continued.
"Actually...I
felt
that
the
prompt
of
the
final
research
paper,
which
had
to
be
twenty
pages
long,
was
slightly
too
boiled
down
and
I
remember
wondering
if
I
had
to
stick
with
the
style
as
outlined
in
the
book
or
if
I
had
the
freedom
to
complement
or
even
diverge
from
the
method
illustrated"
I
replied.
Then
together,
we
went
over
the
prompt
of
that
assignment
and
edited
it.
I
had
the
impression
that
this
first
encounter
with
my
partner
professor
was
crucial
in
establishing
his
objectives
for
the
course
more
clearly,
as
well
as
determining
our
work
ethics.
I
remember
concluding
that
I
was
to
meet
with
each
student
at
least
four
times
over
the
semester
and
that
I
would
set
up
an
appointment
with
Professor
Collins
at
the
end
of
each
set
of
conferences
to
discuss
observations
and
insights
about
how
the
students
were
learning.
From
there
on,
the
program
became
more
than
just
a
way
to
enhance
my
individual
writing,
teaching
and
leadership
skills,
it
also
evolved
into
greater
opportunities
to
engage
in
research
and
to
network
with
professors.
Another
supportive
feature
that
the
writing
program
offers
to
its
writing
associates
is
the
weekly
staff
meeting
held
by
Professor
Tatu.
As
we
gather
in
Pardee
319,
the
get-together
develops
into
an
invaluable
resource
where
I
learnt
how
to
become
a
sympathetic
but
critical
reader.
Through
the
past
experiences
that
senior
WAs
recalled,
I
received
tips
on
how
to
point
out
a
confusing
sentence,
a
weak
argument,
or
insufficient
evidence
to
support
a
claim.
I
also
listened
to
their
ways
to
recognize
an
effective
sentence,
a
strong
thesis,
or
an
interesting
point
of
view
because
I
realized
that
every
writer
does
not
only
benefit
from
highlighting
his/her
mistakes
but
also
by
pinpointing
his/her
strengths.
One
of
my
memorable
staff
meetings
was
the
afternoon
when
two
returning
WAs
mimicked
a
'drop-in
hour'
conference
with
the
aim
of
reminding
other
WAs
that
ultimately
the
writing
"belongs"
to
the
student
who
compose
it
and
that
our
purpose
is
to
help
the
student
achieve
his
or
her
goals.
Undeniably,
as
writing
associates,
we
might
have
the
tendency
to
over-edit
a
student's
work
as
we
try
to
assist.
However,
as
displayed
by
the
WAs
during
the
mock
conference,
doing
so
without
clarifying
our
intentions
can
backfire
and
bruise
the
budding
writer's
confidence.
Therefore,
one
of
the
solutions
proposed
was
to
make
it
clear
to
the
class,
before
the
first
round
of
conference,
that
the
WAs
respect
the
student's
authority
and
autonomy
and
that
their
objectives
are
to
assist
the
students
in
understanding
and
interpreting
the
requirements
of
an
assignment
and
to
help
them
develop
and
clarify
ideas.
Hence,
to
implement
this
advice,
I
remember
asking
Professor
Collins
if
I
could
use
five
minutes
of
his
class
time
to
present
a
short
PowerPoint
that
I
made
to
explain
the
role
of
a
WA
and
to
encourage
my
students
to
fully
exploit
this
resource
that
the
college
offers.
This
first
interaction
helped
communicate
the
responsibility
that
I
would
play
during
their
writing
process,
and
state
that
I
would
act
as
a
bridge
between
the
professor
and
the
students
in
order
to
enhance
the
latter's
learning
and
teaching
of
writing.
That
semester
as
a
WA
went
by
smoothly
with
most
students
eager
to
talk
about
their
drafts
and
meeting
deadlines.
In
addition,
it
was
easy
for
me
to
remind
them
of
any
upcoming
conferences
and
highlight
the
appointment
time
they
selected
since
we
were
using
the
Moodle
scheduler,
a
feature
of
Moodle
that
sends
automatic
reminders
to
students
a
day
or
so
before
the
actual
meeting.
In
my
following
semester
as
a
WA,
I
was
assigned
a
300-level
Economics
class
which
was
taught
by
Professor
Julie
Smith.
Having
never
taken
a
course
in
Money
and
Banking
yet,
I
was
anxious
that
the
material
covered
in
the
class
would
be
so
technical
that
I
would
be
of
little
help
to
the
students.
Nevertheless,
I
knew
that
I
would
have
the
support
of
the
excellent
staff
and
co-writing
associates
when
needed
and
that
I
could
draw
from
my
previous
semester's
experience
to
read
academic
papers
critically.
Indeed,
it
became
apparent
that,
while
academic
writing
was
a
solitary
pursuit
for
most
of
the
upperclassmen,
they
would
always
engage
in
a
discussion
about
their
ideas
as
long
as
you
show
a
genuine
interest
in
their
arguments.
Undeniably,
WA
conferences
in
these
cases
were
a
way
to
try
and
test
their
proposals
out
for
an
audience.
Moreover,
during
that
semester,
it
was
interesting
to
juggle
my
own
VAST
writing
assignments
with
my
WA
duties.
In
fact,
as
a
reader
of
papers
covering
advanced
monetary
policies,
I
understood
the
necessity
of
initially
condensing
an
idea
to
its
core
to
ensure
that
the
concept
is
well-understood
before
trying
to
explain
its
relevance
in
the
paper.
However,
as
I
was
writing
my
first
draft,
it
occurred
to
me
that
I
had
a
tendency
to
construct
convoluted
sentences
only
in
an
attempt
to
mimic
the
academic
speech.
Hence,
my
own
WA
served
as
a
reliable
resource
to
pinpoint
paragraphs
that
seemed
disconnected
as
a
result
of
the
heavy
wording.
On
the
other
hand,
the
only
issue
I
had
with
being
the
WA
of
upperclassmen
was
their
'no-shows'.
In
fact,
since
one
of
my
students
was
consistently
missing
his
conferences
without
prior
notice
or
rescheduling
only
a
few
hour
before
the
actual
meeting
times,
Professor
Smith
and
I
agreed
to
inform
the
students
that
the
out-of-class
peer
reviews
were
mandatory.
Indeed,
it
was
pleasant
that
Professor
Smith
valued
my
feedback
and
that
she
used
it
to
gain
insight
into
how
her
students'
actually
interpret,
process,
and
respond
to
the
thinking
and
writing
tasks
presented
in
the
course.
Over
these
two
semesters,
I
have
lived
great
experiences
by
being
a
WA.
One
day,
one
of
my
students
bumped
into
me
in
the
library
stressed
about
a
paper
and,
after
going
through
his
paper
and
having
a
short
chat
about
it,
he
was
relieved
that
he
had
a
clearer
idea
about
how
he
wanted
to
further
develop
it.
I
think
it
is
an
amazing
feeling
to
know
that
I
have
helped
another
student,
just
like
me,
restore
his
confidence
and
gain
a
better
perspective.
Moreover,
being
a
WA
has
exposed
me
to
such
a
multitude
of
topics,
far
more
than
I
would
have
been
able
to
learn
about
in
my
own
courses
at
Lafayette,
that
it
is
always
refreshing
to
come
back
to
the
program
for
another
year.
Not
only
am
I
looking
forward
to
reading
about
a
new
theme,
I
am
eager
to
understand
how
other
students
will
structure
their
arguments
as
I
believe
that
they
will
improve
my
own
writing.
