As
an
art
form,
writing
is
a
creative
process.
It
involves
spinning
words
from
the
depths
of
one's
mind
into
sentences
that
convey
an
idea,
and
because
one
brings
something
into
existence
when
one
writes,
it
becomes,
in
its
essence,
a
creation.
Writing
can
be
poetic,
or
formulaic,
experimental
in
its
meter,
content,
rhyme
scheme,
it
can
follow
a
predetermined
set
of
rules,
as
Batholomae
put
it,
a
discourse,
or
it
can
be
the
natural
consequence
of
communication
and
the
transfer
of
information
between
people.
Of
course
I
did
not
know
this
the
first
time
I
put
pencil
to
paper,
which
may
or
may
not
be
metaphoric,
as
I
do
not
remember
the
first
time
I
marked
a
letter
onto
a
surface.
Having
grown
up
surrounded
by
computers,
it
is
quite
possible
that
I
typed
before
I
even
penned
anything.
What
I
do
remember
is
my
first
grade
teacher
even
penmanship,
with
its
loops
and
flat-bottomed
characters
(I
later
found
out
Mrs.
Kowalski's
always
wrote
with
a
ruler
lined
up
against
the
lines
of
the
paper)
and
the
assurance
it
gave
my
four
year
old
self.
As
a
class,
we
practiced
our
letters,
but
for
some
reason
they
were
never
quite
as
good
as
hers.
I
blame
it
on
the
underdeveloped
motor
skills.
My
handwriting
constantly
changed
its
slant,
tightness
and
length,
as
it
does
to
this
day.
In
addition
to
practicing
my
ABCs,
first
grade
was
the
first
time
that
I
had
to
practice
my
AABBs
and
my
ABABs.
I
was
exposed
to
verse
in
its
different
basic
forms
(acrostic,
haiku,
couplet,
triplet,
quatrain,
etc.)
as
part
of
a
poetry
unit,
ending
with
the
compilation
of
our
own
poetry
anthologies.
I
still
have
mine
to
this
day,
which
must
be
a
contributing
factor
to
why
this
anthology
is
my
first
memory
of
writing.
My
prized
poem
was
a
LeWitt
version
of
the
first
stanza
of
Lewis
Carroll's
The
Jabberwocky.
It
read,
Beware
the
Jabberwock,
my
son!/The
jaws
that
bite,
the
claws
that
catch!/Beware
the
cashpish
[Jubjub
bird],
and
shun/The
leggery
taggis
[frumious
Bandersnatch]!
Illustrations
of
peeing
cash
registers
and
creatures
resembling
octopi
accompanied
the
thoughtful
words.
I
can
still
hear
my
sister's
roaring
laughter
at
this,
the
finest
of
my
first
grade
poetry.
The
other
noteworthy
mention
of
my
early
writing
is
something
I
wrote
for
and
distributed
to
my
fourth
grade
class,
a
four-stanzaed
Joy
to
the
World:
My
Teacher's
Dead
that
eventually
led
to
my
suspension
from
school.
It
could
be
said
that
my
initiative
for
musical
education
went
unthanked
by
most.
The
writing
I
did
in
middle
school
can
and
should
be
summed
up
by
this:
book
reports,
book
reports,
and
oh,
can
someone
say
book
reports?
There
was
one
exception,
which
was
a
group
research
paper
on
Ireland
and
its
trouble
with
those
pesky
potatoes.
Ninth
grade
and
its
honors
biology
followed
middle
school
nicely,
with
weekly
lab
reports,
thesis
and
research
papers.
I
wonder
where
the
divide
between
book
report
and
thesis
paper
occurs,
and
I
suppose
that
it
falls
exactly
when
the
concept
of
a
thesis
paper
is
explained
to
you,
and
from
then
on,
thesis
papers
are
required.
When
you
write
a
thesis
paper,
it
means
you
are
arguing
something
and
you
have
to
prove
your
point
was
the
explanation
I
was
given.
That
year
I
most
certainly
was
also
explained
the
five-paragraph
essay,
as
my
papers
on
Catcher
in
the
Rye,
Taming
of
the
Shrew,
and
comparison
essays
on
Updike's
short
stories
about
the
American
Dream
followed
that
trusty
pattern.
It
was
always
easier
for
me
to
write
thesis
papers
than
either
lab
reports
or
research
papers.
Lab
reports
had
a
structure
to
them
that
was
easy
to
follow,
but
oy!,
was
the
content
difficult
to
produce.
Research
papers
bore
me.
I
feel
and
have
felt
since
I
began
writing
them
that
one
is
just
gathering
others'
thoughts
on
a
subject
you
know
little
about
and
spitting
them
out
in
concise
paragraphs.
Nothing
original
was
being
said.
I
wrote
nothing
remarkable,
or
rather
my
teachers
did
not
foster
within
me
the
feeling
that
I
wrote
anything
remarkable
until
10th
grade.
I
had
a
wonderfully
intelligent
teacher
who
was
very
fastidious
when
it
came
to
grammar
and
type-font
(size
12
Times
New
Roman,
double
spaced,
1-inch
margins;
deductions
for
punctuation
mistakes
and
occasionally
syntactical
errors
too)
named
Mrs.
Gordon.
In
that
class,
I
wrote
several
successful
thesis
papers,
but
most
enjoyed
composing
two
creative
writing
pieces.
The
former
was
based
on
Homer's
The
Odyssey,
wherein
I
mused
from
the
perspective
of
princess
Naussika,
and
the
latter
a
modern-day
tale
of
creating
a
monster,
such
as
in
Frankenstein.
My
piece,
entitled,
The
Heinous
Creature
with
Teeth
described
the
acclimation
period
I,
the
President
of
the
United
States,
underwent
when
I
fell
into
a
barrel
of
toxic
waste
and
developed
an
unborn
twin.
As
told
on
the
day
before
the
funeral
for
the
creature,
Tabitha,
the
story
unveils
a
roller
coaster
of
emotions,
from
pure
hatred,
to
acceptance,
and
finally,
to
happiness.
I
received
an
A
and
high
praise
for
my
creativity.
Again,
my
sister
was
in
stitches.
Tenth
grade
also
marked
the
year
that
I
became
confident
as
a
writer,
which
I
am
certain
was
a
product
of
having
a
teacher
who
was
extremely
enamored
with
my
writing
abilities.
At
the
end
of
the
year
she
paid
me
the
highest
compliment
I've
ever
received
about
my
writing,
When
you
write
your
first
book,
I'd
like
an
autographed
copy.
The
following
academic
year
I
shipped
off
to
Israel
with
51
peers
for
the
first
semester,
and
kept
a
journal.
I
was
encouraged
to
do
so
by
my
teachers,
but
it
was
not
mandatory.
I
found
the
process
of
putting
down
my
daily
thoughts
to
be
therapeutic,
though
on
the
days
when
I
travelled,
the
entries
sometimes
felt
cumbersome.
Some
days
I
felt
like
writing
took
away
from
time
when
I
could
be
doing
other
things,
but
in
retrospect,
it
was
a
much
better
use
of
my
time,
not
just
for
posterity's
sake,
but
for
my
own.
In
many
ways
I
wish
I
had
kept
a
journal
after
I
returned,
and
perhaps
writing
this
will
serve
as
inspiration
to
begin
journaling
once
more.
I
found
the
process
of
writing
my
thoughts
to
be
particularly
effective
when
I
went
to
Prague,
Czech
Republic
and
Poland,
as
part
of
the
Holocaust
studies
built
into
my
curriculum.
It
was
an
immensely
heavy
experience,
and
pouring
out
what
I
was
feeling
onto
paper
allowed
me
to
better
cope
with
the
emotions
and
sights
I
had
felt
and
seen.
Another
type
of
writing
that
I
explored
while
in
the
Holy
Land
was
reaction
entries.
In
my
English
class
I
read
The
Scarlet
Letter,
and
was
required
to
write
my
thoughts
about
each
of
the
chapters.
While
these
assignments
were
several
steps
above
the
dreaded
book
report,
the
work
was
not
very
challenging,
and
my
teacher
did
not
push
my
writing,
though
when
my
class
had
finished
for
the
semester
she
did
comment
that
she
was
impressed
with
my
writing
abilities;
I
did
well
enough
in
the
class
to
back
that
up!
I
also
wrote
a
defense
of
the
trip
from
the
perspective
of
a
student
addressing
the
school
board.
The
most
important
piece
I
was
assigned
to
write
was
for
my
Core
class,
about
what
it
means
[to
you]
to
be
a
Jew.
It
was
an
essay
question
on
a
test,
and
extemporaneously
allowed
me
to
be
introspective
about
my
religion
and
how
it
defines
me.
The
essay
was
contextualized
by
the
content
of
the
three-month-long
course
in
Jewish
and
Israeli
history.
Having
to
take
a
long
and
rich
history
and
couple
it
to
my
own
identity
made
me
more
thoughtful
than
I
usually
am
in
my
writing,
because
what
I
was
writing
represented
my
ideas
more
than
how
I
worded
them.
Before
I
left
I
wrote
an
article
for
my
synagogue's
newsletter
about
my
experiences
in
Israel
which
detailed
three
trips
that
I
had
taken
to
Jerusalem,
to
the
southern,
desert
region
called
the
Negev,
and
across
the
country
from
the
Mediterranean
to
the
Sea
of
Galilee.
It
was
my
first
published
piece
of
journalism;
my
parents
were
proud
of
me.
My
writing
remained
relatively
stagnant
in
quality
the
following
semester,
with
the
bulk
of
my
papers
on
topics
relating
to
industrialization,
reconstruction
after
the
Civil
War,
Jewish
Ethics
and
muckraking.
As
I
write
this,
I
am
realizing
that
I
am
not
patterning
my
growth
as
a
writer
off
of
any
of
my
writings
in
non-English
subjects.
To
be
accurate,
I
wrote
lengthy
papers
in
history
each
year
as
well
which
I
am
sure
did
not
hinder
my
writing
abilities.
Why
then
am
I
only
marking
my
English
successes
and
not
others
that
also
received
praise?
To
be
sure,
I
valued
the
creativity
that
English
pieces
afforded
me.
English
allowed
me
to
express
myself
as
a
writer
much
more
easily
than
in
other
subjects,
in
which
the
writing
was
based
more
on
describing
information.
Another
contributing
factor
is
that
my
English
teachers
were
more
nurturing
and
cared
more
about
my
development
as
a
writer.
After
eleventh
grade,
a
great
deal
of
focus
and
effort
was
put
into
my
college
essay.
I
remember
reading
that
the
first
line
of
your
essay
should
always
stand
out
and
capture
the
admission
officer's
attention,
so
I
crafted
what
I
thought
was
a
great
first
sentence
about
the
day
I
became
vegetarian
and
the
journey
it
took
me
on,
As
I
breathed
in
the
potent
smell
of
a
thousand
flames
grilling,
I
longed
to
vomit.
I
put
more
time
into
that
essay
than
any
other
composition
in
all
of
high
school,
and
the
reaction
to
my
essay:
acceptance
to
Lafayette
College,
was
enough
of
a
confidence
booster
that
it
put
me
in
a
very
good
position
to
blossom
as
a
writer
in
twelfth
grade.
My
writing
improved
significantly,
and
as
I
browse
through
past
documents
on
my
computer,
those
from
senior
year
seem
to
be
ones
to
which
I
would
still
be
content
affixing
my
name.
I
composed
a
piece
that
received
great
praise
from
my
teacher
about
firing
a
gun,
and
the
entire
sensory
experience
therein.
It
was
an
intimate
breakdown
of
each
of
the
senses
and
the
interactions
between
them.
Improving
my
ability
to
fine
tune
the
way
my
words
played
off
one
another
onomatopoetically,
this
piece
was
my
first
experience
in
the
self-referencing
power
of
words.
I
was
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
write
about
firing
a
gun,
as
I
felt
a
barrage
of
powerful
emotions
while
I
was
doing
it.
(I
should
add,
at
this
point,
that
I
fired
a
gun,
at
a
shooting
range,
as
part
of
a
four
day
Israeli
army
training
program)
In
order
to
recall
what
it
was
like
to
fire
a
gun,
I
was
required
to
reflect
strongly
on
the
event
as
I
remembered
it,
but
writing
it
down
allowed
me
to
transfer
some
of
what
I
felt
to
another
person,
so
she
could
experience
it
in
some
way
as
well.
I
also
wrote
a
very
short
memoir,
about
my
transition
into
girlhood.
The
Pants
That
Were
was
another
reflection
into
my
past,
albeit
must
more
distant,
to
a
day
when
I
bought
my
first
pair
of
jeans,
and
how
that
marked
both
the
acceptance
of
a
new
person,
and
the
closing
off
of
part
of
my
youth.
In
order
to
write
any
memoir,
a
great
deal
of
introspection
and
analysis
must
occur,
and
my
four
pager
was
no
exception.
I
looked
back
at
who
had
influenced
me
and
acknowledged
those
people
for
what
I
had
learned,
and
I
mused
on
who
I
was
going
to
be
in
the
future,
and
how
the
decision
to
give
up
wearing
boys'
clothes
changed
me.
Enrolled
as
I
was
in
AP
Literature
and
Composition,
I
took
to
writing
impromptus
on
various
literary
topics,
generally
focused
around
short
stories.
Towards
the
end
of
the
year,
my
class
began
a
poetry
unit
which
sparked
my
love
for
poetry
to
this
day.
During
and
after
the
unit,
I
began
writing
my
own
poetry,
and
every
now
and
then
get
the
inspiration
and
the
right
words
pop
into
my
head.
For
the
class,
I
wrote
a
paper
analyzing
Yeats'
poetry,
which
did
not
receive
the
best
critique.
My
teacher,
Mrs.
Weisgrau
was
hard
on
me,
and
I
knew
I
could
try
better.
The
writing
was
sloppy,
and
the
analysis
lacking;
it
was
definitely
not
my
finest
work.
The
criticism
encouraged
me
to
try
harder
in
other
one
of
her
classes,
Voice.
I
took
great
pride
in
what
I
produced
for
that
class,
and
it
was
easy,
since
all
that
was
demanded
was
that
you
find
your
voice.
One
of
the
more
memorable
compositions
was
a
story
in
which
each
sentence
started
with
the
next
letter
in
the
alphabet,
beginning
with
A.
I
told
the
tale
of
two
neighborhood
boys
who
were
spending
their
last
few
days
enjoying
their
home
life
before
they
headed
off
for
school.
I
particularly
like
the
last
sentence,
so
I
will
share
it
with
you,
ZZZZZZZ
clicked
and
hummed
the
night
insects
in
harmony,
the
Pomp
and
Circumstance
to
which
the
two
friends
rose
together
and
strolled
down
the
street
in
silence,
one
heart
beating
in
time
with
the
melody,
one
heart
quickened,
drinking
in
their
last
night
in
the
town
only
one
heart
would
leave.
In
Voice
I
wrote
pieces
that
were
truthful
and
mendacious
(this
was
assigned)
and
listed
things
that
made
angry,
happy,
and
things
that
I
wanted.
Writing
for
this
class
was
very
personal
and
I
really
had
to
listen
to
my
inner
voice
and
have
that
transcribed
by
my
inner
writer.
I
was
comfortable
writing
about
things
I
probably
would
not
have
been
comfortable
writing
about,
or
would
have
ever
written
by
myself.
After
high
school,
I
returned
to
Israel
for
10
months,
and
did
not
journal
quite
as
much
as
the
previous
trip.
I
do
recall
being
extremely
sad
for
the
first
week
or
so,
and
writing
my
feelings
down,
with
the
occasional
encouraging
saying.
It
proved
to
be
cathartic
and
helpful
to
verbalize
my
emotions
and
sometime
soon
after
I
typed
the
page
or
so,
I
began
to
feel
better.
Writing
has
a
funny
way
of
slapping
you
in
the
face
with
how
you
are
feeling
or
thinking.
By
putting
it
down
on
paper
or
typing
it
onto
a
computer
screen,
you
do
not
have
to
think
about
what
you
are
feeling
as
much,
because
hey,
there
it
is,
in
sentences.
College.
College
writing
is
harder
than
high
school
writing.
I
could
not
get
away
with
crafty
sentences,
the
content
was
much
more
important,
and
I
had
to
back
up
my
arguments
with
substantial
proof.
FYS
required
a
good
amount
of
writing,
mostly
summarizing
and
analyzing
current
events,
though
the
paper
at
the
end
proved
to
be
challenging.
I
took
two
writing
('W')
classes,
one
of
which
required
only
thesis
papers,
and
the
other
of
which
allowed
for
more
creative,
historical
papers.
If
it
is
not
obvious
as
of
yet,
I
have
not
really
processed
these
recent
writing
experiences.
In
one
of
my
writing
classes,
a
teacher
complemented
my
creative
writing
abilities
saying
something
along
the
lines
of
you
have
a
unique
gift
for
creative
writing.
I
recommend
you
take
the
Creative
Writing
course
that
the
college
offers.
The
flair
that
I
put
into
this
paper
pushed
me
into
the
A
range,
when
the
paper
itself
could
have
contained
more
content.
While
it
is
important
to
know
who
you
are
writing
for
and
what
should
be
included
in
your
papers,
writing
well
always
pays
off.
While
in
college
I
have
written
some
poetry
and
also
explored
stream-of-consciousness
writing
which
I
love.
I
have
always
had
a
fascination
with
Joyce
and
his
writing
style,
and
while
I
do
not
write
with
his
scrupulous
meanness,
I
enjoy
letting
my
mind
wander
and
writing
whatever
comes
to
me.
Sometimes
my
papers
end
abruptly.
