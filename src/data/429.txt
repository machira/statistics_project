New

Associate

My
Literacy
Narrative
Before
I
even
entered
college,
I
was
often
faced
with
the
question
of
what
subject
I
was
planning
to
major
in.
Throughout
high
school
I
enjoyed
many
different
subjects,
yet
never
found
one
specific
thing
that
captured
my
attention.
I
did,
however,
notice
that
there
was
a
common
thread
among
all
the
classes
I
loved
the
most
Dthey
all
involved
some
form
of
reading
and
writing,
often
in
conjunction
with
one
another.
Almost
without
realizing
it,
I
decided
to
be
an
English
major,
since
it
encompasses
so
many
forms
of
reading
and
writing
without
forcing
me
to
choose
just
one
specific
subject
matter.
I
can
write
in
multiple
styles
and
experiment
with
which
forms
work
best
with
my
own
personal
use
of
language
and
expression.
By
examining
my
past
experiences
with
writing
throughout
my
life,
I
have
just
begun
to
understand
how
certain
projects
throughout
my
writing
history
have
impacted
my
style
and
choices
within
my
writings
today.
Even
though
the
format
of
my
writing
has
changed
since
I
began
writing,
reading
and
writing
have
always
been
a
major
part
of
my
life,
both
in
and
out
of
my
academic
career.
My
earliest
experience
of
writing
on
my
own
is
from
my
first
grade
class,
when
we
were
assigned
to
create
our
own
story
books.
My
teacher
told
us
we
could
write
about
anything
we
wanted
to,
and
as
a
precursor
to
my
future
writing
patterns,
I
wrote
about
something
I
loved:
my
new
baby
brother.
I
wrote
and
illustrated
the
entire
book
on
my
own,
and
when
the
story
was
completed,
my
teacher
bound
and
laminated
our
books
for
us
to
keep.
I
had
always
loved
reading
various
books,
so
the
fact
that
I
could
create
my
own
book
with
a
story
I
wrote
was
very
exciting
for
me.
While
some
students
struggled
and
complained
about
having
to
write
their
own
narratives,
I
found
it
interesting
and
fun
to
be
able
to
share
one
of
my
stories
with
everyone
else.
First
grade
was
also
a
very
formative
year
for
my
writing
because
it
was
the
first
year
my
teacher
required
us
to
keep
journals.
Every
day,
we
had
established
journal
time
during
which
we
had
to
write
some
account
of
our
days
in
our
journals.
This
practice
of
maintaining
a
journal
continued
through
fifth
grade,
and
as
I
advanced
in
age,
the
teachersO
responses
to
my
journals
changed
in
accordance
to
the
assignments.
My
teachers
always
collected
our
journals
to
read,
correct,
and
comment
on
the
entries,
but
these
responses
varied
greatly
from
year
to
year.
For
example,
in
first
grade,
my
teacher
provided
us
with
spelling
and
grammatical
corrections,
along
with
encouraging
comments
that
acknowledged
the
accounts
we
had
written.
However,
in
third
grade,
I
was
no
longer
restricted
to
the
subject
matter
of
what
had
happened
during
my
day,
and
was
therefore
free
to
write
about
anything
I
wanted
to
share.
While
many
of
my
classmates
used
their
newfound
artistic
freedom
to
create
extreme
tales
of
adventure
and
fantasy,
I
once
again
chose
to
write
about
something
I
loved,
and
used
my
family
as
the
basis
for
my
tales.
My
first
long
story
revolved
around
our
family
vacations
to
North
Carolina,
where
we
spend
the
two
months
of
summer
with
my
grandparents
every
year.
Although
I
did
not
know
it
at
the
time,
this
was
only
the
first
of
many
stories
of
mine
to
take
place
in
this
setting,
and
even
though
characters,
circumstances,
and
situations
often
changed,
I
found
myself
repeatedly
returning
to
the
southern
environment
that
has
been
so
pivotal
to
my
life.
My
third
grade
journal
story
propelled
me
to
create
other
tales,
many
of
which
were
family
oriented.
My
teacher
recognized
my
love
of
writing,
and
provided
me
with
extra
journal
notebooks
and
the
encouragement
to
continue
writing
at
home
as
well.
As
I
progressed
into
fourth
and
fifth
grade,
my
teachersO
comments
became
more
focused
on
the
content
of
what
I
was
writing
since
I
had
learned
many
of
the
grammatical
lessons
in
class.
They
encouraged
me
to
experiment
with
different
forms
of
writing,
which
helped
me
prepare
for
future
writing
assignments
I
was
to
encounter.
When
I
entered
sixth
grade,
I
once
again
found
myself
in
the
position
of
writing
my
own
book.
Our
reading
and
writing
classes
combined
to
give
us
the
assignment
of
writing
about
our
familiesO
histories
of
reading.
We
had
to
research
the
role
that
reading
has
played
throughout
generations
of
our
families,
finally
concluding
with
how
reading
has
impacted
our
own
lives.
The
project
forced
me
to
analyze
my
approaches
to
reading
and
as
a
result,
writing,
since
I
had
to
articulate
not
only
my
personal
opinions,
but
those
of
others
as
well.
It
was
the
first
time
I
had
analyzed
anything
other
than
a
story
book,
and
it
was
interesting
to
discover
how
the
descriptions
within
my
writing
changed
to
accommodate
the
accounts
of
the
personal
narratives
I
told.
In
regards
to
documenting
my
own
reading
history,
I
had
to
formulate
the
response
completely
on
my
own,
without
any
previous
text
to
refer
to.
I
realized
how
important
word
choice
is
in
regards
to
the
clarity
of
the
work,
and
the
overall
writing
experience
heightened
my
awareness
of
my
own
writing
style.
In
sixth
grade,
I
also
had
my
introduction
to
poetry
due
to
an
elongated
poetry
project.
In
addition
to
studying
established
poets,
we
were
required
to
write
our
own
poems
and
I
became
fascinated
with
the
lyric
and
rhythmic
aspects
unique
to
poetry.
I
loved
experimenting
with
different
rhyme
schemes
and
meters
and
was
especially
captivated
by
the
often
disguised
power
and
emotion
hidden
within
lines
of
poetry.
Once
again,
I
could
not
avoid
the
subject
matters
important
to
me
and
wrote
a
poem
about
the
atmosphere
of
the
beach
I
knew
so
well.
I
was
excited
to
be
able
to
capture
so
many
aspects
of
the
scene
I
loved
within
one
set
of
words,
and
I
strived
to
create
not
only
the
visual
description
of
my
location,
but
the
sound,
smell,
and
feeling
of
it
as
well.
I
wanted
to
share
my
interpretation
of
something
I
cared
about
with
others,
and
submitted
my
poem
to
a
local
North
Carolina
newspaper,
where
it
was
published
in
the
weekly
paper.
I
began
to
realize
the
joy
that
accompanied
writing
about
something
I
understood,
something
I
knew
well,
and
was
able
to
focus
more
of
my
attention
on
clearly
expressing
my
opinions
in
ways
that
were
coherent
to
others.
I
had
always
loved
reading
various
texts,
and
it
was
very
intriguing
that
I
could
create
my
own
written
works
for
others
to
read
as
well.
A
major
change
in
my
writing
history
occurred
when
I
transferred
to
private
school
in
seventh
grade.
One
of
the
first
differences
I
noticed
in
class
structure
was
the
increased
amount
of
writing
in
all
classes,
not
just
those
specifically
dedicated
to
English.
Teachers
emphasized
writing
skills
and
styles
in
history
research
papers,
foreign
language
compositions,
and
science
laboratory
reports
just
as
much
as
they
did
in
English
essays.
There
was
always
some
form
of
writing
assigned,
whether
it
was
essays,
journals,
homework
assignments,
or
in-class
work.
I
also
was
introduced
to
the
editing
process
of
papers,
where
teachers
and
other
students
read
each
othersO
pieces
and
provided
feedback
to
help
express
the
main
arguments
of
the
papers.
Each
school
year
also
had
at
least
one
major
writing
project.
For
example,
I
learned
the
complete
process
of
writing
a
research
paper
in
eighth
grade,
including
how
to
gather
sources,
record
note
cards,
create
an
annotated
bibliography,
and
cite
all
of
my
sources.
My
high
school
greatly
emphasized
its
Honor
Code
as
well,
so
proper
citation
and
documentation
quickly
became
second
nature
to
me
while
composing
any
form
of
written
work.
Because
this
practice
was
instilled
in
my
writing
habits
early
in
my
career,
it
was
not
an
issue
once
I
advanced
to
college
level
writings,
which
all
require
careful
documentation
of
sources.
Many
courses
also
required
that
students
complete
interdisciplinary
projects
that
combined
lessons
learned
from
two
different
subjects.
For
example,
during
my
freshman
year,
I
wrote
a
research
paper
that
spanned
the
subjects
discussed
in
my
comparative
cultures
history
class
and
the
Greek
literature
unit
of
my
English
class.
Every
course
was
writing
intensive,
and
teachers
continuously
spent
year
after
year
making
sure
we
understood
the
guidelines
of
writing
regardless
of
the
subject
matter
about
which
we
were
writing.
I
quickly
became
comfortable
with
writing
in
the
typical
analytical
style
of
essay
writing
used
in
so
many
of
my
classes.
However,
the
perfectly
structured
outline
became
obsolete
when
I
began
my
tenth
grade
English
class.
My
teacher
was
a
published
author
often
considered
to
be
eccentric
and
somewhat
radical
compared
to
other
teachers.
My
teacherOs
first
struggle
with
my
class
was
getting
us
to
abandon
the
standard
essay
mold
we
clung
to
after
spending
so
many
years
engraining
it
in
our
brains.
He
then
made
sure
to
instill
at
least
thirty
basic
grammar
rules
in
our
minds,
using
our
high
schoolOs
NManual
of
StyleO,
co-written
by
my
teacher,
as
a
guide.
He
thoroughly
explained
grammatical
rules
that
other
teachers
had
previously
assumed
we
understood
or
had
taught
us
without
providing
any
explanation
as
to
why
they
are
so.
Our
Manual
of
Style
supplied
information
regarding
everything
we
would
need
to
create
any
form
of
writing,
complete
with
grammar
rules,
note-taking
skills,
use
of
quotations,
and
citations.
Students
never
had
any
excuses
to
not
know
how
to
properly
write,
and
teachers
repeatedly
made
sure
we
knew
how
to
use
our
Style
Manual
and
understood
its
lessons.
My
tenth
grade
teacher
also
forced
us
to
integrate
more
creativity
in
our
writing
assignments.
For
example,
instead
of
writing
a
typical
analysis
of
Geoffrey
ChaucerOs
The
Canterbury
Tales,
we
had
to
write
our
own
Canterbury
Tale,
exactly
in
the
format,
meter,
and
rhyme
scheme
originally
used
by
Chaucer.
We
also
had
to
write
a
story
imitating
the
style
and
language
of
Ernest
Hemmingway,
which
provided
me
with
some
of
the
most
valuable
lessons
IOve
ever
gained
in
regards
to
writing.
Using
Hemmingway
as
an
example,
my
teacher
taught
me
how
to
cut
down
my
wordiness
and
get
straight
to
the
point
of
what
I
am
trying
to
say.
He
showed
me
how
it
is
often
more
effective
to
clearly
state
something
once
rather
than
attempting
to
use
multiple
synonyms
and
adjectives.
My
teacher
encouraged
us
to
write
according
to
the
statement
made
by
Henry
James,
NShow,
donOt
tell.O
Do
not
try
to
explain
things
by
overwhelming
others
with
elaborate
descriptions,
but
rather
provide
an
explanation
that
is
both
effective
and
efficient.
I
learned
how
to
capture
and
hold
a
readerOs
attention
while
maintaining
an
expressive
and
interesting
writing
style.
Through
my
many
writing
assignments
in
high
school,
I
gradually
realized
what
I
enjoyed
writing
about
the
most
and
in
which
ways
to
best
express
myself.
Through
a
revelation
that
seems
obvious,
I
concluded
that
I
love
to
write
about
subjects
I
care
about
and
have
a
comprehensive
understanding
of.
I
inevitably
return
to
write
about
what
I
know,
and
when
I
best
understand
something
myself,
I
am
able
to
provide
a
portrayal
of
it
to
others
through
the
best
of
my
ability.
It
also
provides
me
with
a
challenge,
to
reinvent
certain
topics
that
may
be
similar
in
some
ways,
yet
by
using
a
different
writing
form
or
technique,
they
become
different
works
altogether.
By
writing
so
often
in
school,
I
have
found
writing
on
my
own
to
be
a
powerful
outlet
for
my
own
personal
emotions
as
well.
I
have
been
able
to
use
school
assignments
to
create
stories
that
help
me
deal
with
certain
events
in
my
life,
which
result
in
helping
me
emotionally
far
more
than
they
relate
to
my
academic
life.
Certain
projects
have
given
me
reasons
to
think
and
write
about
things
I
otherwise
might
not
have
considered
and
had
not
even
realized
I
wanted
to
write
about
until
the
opportunity
came
along.
By
writing
my
own
accounts
of
particular
events,
I
am
forced
to
acknowledge
what
happened
and
how
it
changed
my
life.
However,
I
also
have
the
freedom
within
my
writing
to
alter
situations
and
experiment
with
the
results
if
things
had
happened
differently.
Writers
have
the
power
to
create
any
circumstances
they
can
conceive,
without
being
forced
to
follow
any
particular
format
or
structure.
While
many
first-year
college
students
worried
about
the
transition
from
high
school
to
college
writing,
I
found
myself
fortunate
to
be
one
of
those
who
felt
adequately
prepared
for
the
writing
challenges
of
college
courses.
My
high
school
provided
a
rigorous
and
extensive
writing
program
that
challenged
us
to
learn
multiple
writing
styles
regarding
various
subject
matters,
therefore
preparing
us
for
the
majority
of
the
challenges
created
by
college
writing
expectations.
For
example,
one
similarity
IOve
found
between
my
later
high
school
and
early
college
courses
is
the
freedom
professors
provide
students
in
choosing
the
specific
subject
matter
of
their
papers.
While
there
are
usually
basic
guidelines,
students
are
often
required
to
structure
and
create
their
own
theses
and
arguments
for
their
papers.
I
greatly
appreciate
this
method
of
paper
writing,
since
it
allows
me
to
use
the
knowledge
I
understand
best
to
support
and
explain
the
points
of
my
writings.
Since
I
am
one
who
thrives
on
being
able
to
write
about
what
I
know
and
understand,
I
enjoy
being
able
to
choose
my
own
topic
and
style
to
go
about
arguing
my
point.
However,
this
freedom
is
also
difficult
because
it
can
sometimes
become
overwhelming
and
too
unstructured.
I
sometimes
find
myself
wanting
to
include
more
than
one
main
argument
in
my
papers
and
not
able
to
initially
focus
my
thesis.
This
style
of
writing
assignment
forces
students
to
structure
themselves
and
provide
their
own
guidelines,
which
can
be
difficult.
Because
there
is
no
set
formula
for
choosing
my
own
topics
and
writing
styles,
this
format
of
writing
also
teaches
me
how
to
recognize
when
a
certain
idea
is
not
working.
I
am
still
in
the
process
of
learning
how
to
focus
my
ideas
and
arguments
on
what
is
absolutely
essential
to
my
argument,
as
well
as
when
to
abandon
a
thesis
or
supporting
topic
that
is
more
damaging
than
conducive
to
my
overall
writing.
Largely
in
part
to
my
first
year
college
courses,
I
have
learned
that
it
is
sometimes
more
productive
to
discard
certain
ideas
and
begin
all
over
again
with
completely
new
thoughts
and
arguments.
Overall,
one
of
the
most
important
things
to
remember
while
writing
is
that
it
is
never
a
final
process.
Changes
can
always
be
made
to
previous
works,
and
writers
are
constantly
learning
new
aspects
of
style
and
technique
which
alter
their
writings.
Sometimes
new
ideas
work
well,
but
other
times
they
are
more
detrimental
than
what
was
planned.
Writing
is
a
continuous
process
that
allows
people
to
express
themselves
any
way
they
choose
to,
without
having
to
answer
to
anyone
else.
It
can
be
as
structured
or
as
lose
as
the
writer
wants
it
to
be,
and
I
am
extremely
excited
to
continue
exploring
my
writing
future
to
see
what
I
learn
and
create.
