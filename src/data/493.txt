Dear
Diary:
A
Personal
History
of
Personal
Writing
By
M.
I
must
have
been
about
five
when
my
grandmother
gave
it
to
me.
Today
I
could
guiltlessly
call
it
my
favorite
Christmas
gift
of
the
year,
simply
because
I
donOt
remember
any
of
the
others.
It
was
beautiful.
A
red,
white,
and
pink
design
swirled
over
the
cover.
A
lock.
Two
keys!
Perfume-scented
pages
of
pale
pink,
blue,
yellow,
and
pink
again!
I
remember
my
grandmother
leaning
down
to
me
and
whispering
discreetly,
NYou
can
write
all
your
secret
thoughts
in
hereE
the
private
oneOs
that
you
donOt
want
anyone
else
to
read.
And
then
you
can
lock
it
up
and
hide
it
and
even
the
boys
can
never
read
it.O
My
brotherOs
eyes
lit
up
at
the
challenge.
I
saw
him
exchanging
furtive
glances
with
my
cousins.
I
vowed
inwardly
to
keep
this
diary
always
locked
and
so
well
hidden
that
theyOd
never
find
it.
I
looked
down
at
the
book,
excited
at
being
so
grown
up
that
I
could
be
private.
I
thought
about
hiding
it
outside.
Maybe
in
a
hole.
Covering
it
with
dirt.
No,
I
decided.
That
would
ruin
the
smell.
The
pages
would
be
all
browned
and
it
wouldnOt
be
perfect
anymore.
I
fumbled
with
the
key
and
opened
the
diary.
Leaning
in,
I
sniffed
the
perfume.
Not
too
much,
though.
I
didnOt
want
to
sniff
it
all
away.
My
brother
and
the
other
boys
appeared
before
me.
NWhat
are
you
writing
about?O
Nothing,
I
told
them.
I
closed
the
book
quickly,
not
to
unleash
the
wonderful
smell.
The
boys
looked
at
me
skeptically,
probably
wondering
if
it
was
worth
it
to
steal
it
yet.
I
stood
up.
IOm
busy,
I
said,
with
an
air
of
undeserved
importance.
I
sat
in
the
pantry
where
my
uncle
kept
his
wine.
It
was
quiet
and
lonely,
with
a
cold
cement
floor
that
I
felt
through
my
skirt.
I
didnOt
like
being
in
there
alone,
but
I
needed
my
privacy.
Again
I
opened
up
the
diary
and
smelled
it.
Roses?
Lilacs?
I
stared
at
this
first
blank
page.
My
secrets.
All
of
the
secret
thoughts
I
have
been
holding
in
all
these
years.
I
started
in
my
most
perfect
handwriting:
DEAR
DIARY.
Comma.
I
realized
I
had
nothing
to
write.
I
had
no
secrets.
Never
did
it
occur
to
me
to
write
what
I
had
done
that
day
or
what
I
was
planning
for
tomorrow.
I
could
have
written
about
visiting
my
cousinOs
house
on
Christmas,
about
my
grandmother
giving
me
a
diary.
I
could
have
written
about
who
I
was
and
what
I
liked
to
do.
No,
diaries
are
for
secrets.
So
I
sat
in
the
cold
and
thought
for
a
very
long
time
what
my
first
secret
was
to
be.
After
a
good
deal
of
time
I
skipped
one
line.
Then
continued
I
HATE
IT
WHEN
MY
PARENTS
SCREAM
AT
ME.
This
was
a
secret,
I
decided.
I
would
never
tell
them,
so
it
is
a
secret,
right?
I
shut
the
book
quickly
at
the
sudden
regret
of
that
one
line.
They
didnOt
scream
at
me
that
much.
Only
when
I
did
something
wrong.
I
felt
a
sudden
burden
of
guilt.
What
if
they
ever
read
it?
I
locked
the
diary.
I
thought
about
tearing
out
the
page.
But
then
the
book
would
be
ruined.
The
diary
haunted
me
with
the
childish
cruelty
of
my
own
thoughts.
I
never
wrote
another
entry,
although
I
kept
it
for
years.
At
first,
I
frequently
opened
it
up
and
smelled
the
pages.
I
hid
it
well
under
my
bed
and
hated
it
secretly.
It
disturbed
me
to
no
end
that
I
couldnOt
be
normal
and
think
of
good
secrets
to
write.
I
realized
that
maybe
I
couldnOt
keep
a
diary
because
I
didnOt
have
enough
secrets.
Maybe
I
didnOt
have
any
secrets.
I
stared
at
the
eleven
carefully
constructed
words
on
the
page.
Well,
I
had
a
secret
now.
Although
possibly
not
the
most
inspiring
beginning
for
a
writer,
a
failed
diary
has
been
a
reoccurring
event
throughout
my
literary
life.
Growing
up
with
the
consistent
dream
of
being
an
author,
I
saw
this
as
a
major
personal
flaw.
Although
I
could
compose
stories
about
anything
and
anyone
with
surprising
ease
and
flexibility,
I
found
myself
speechless
when
attempting
to
compose
anything
remotely
nonfiction.
By
eight
years
of
age,
I
decided
the
reason
for
this
was
that
I
was
too
much
of
a
private
person.
I
had
too
many
secrets.
(No,
the
irony
of
this
never
occurred
to
me).
I
loved
the
process
of
writing
and
would
constantly
be
composing
stories
in
my
head.
When
I
told
my
parents
I
wanted
to
be
an
author,
and
my
father
told
me
that
the
thing
that
had
helped
him
most
with
his
writing
was
to
keep
a
daily
journal.
Although
I
tried
this
many
times,
I
consistently
found
it
impossible
for
me.
Instead,
I
took
to
writing
every
day
on
my
fiction
stories.
My
writing
mimicked
my
reading,
both
in
style,
content,
and
even
category.
At
eight,
I
was
reading
novels,
and
attempting
to
write
them,
too.
Although
I
never
finished
any
of
them,
I
spent
a
good
deal
of
my
free
time
writing.
For
a
while
I
worked
on
a
story
called
NPinkO.
This
was
about
a
girl
who
disappeared
into
a
world
with
divided
into
regions
of
each
color.
I
never
finished
it.
Instead,
I
got
wrapped
up
in
reading
mysteries
and
started
a
new
novel.
This
one
was
called
NThe
Murder
at
Muddy
Brook
FarmO.
I
never
finished
this
either.
In
fifth
grade
I
met
my
best
friend
and
fellow
fiction
writer.
It
is
a
Friday
afternoon,
and
we
sat
lazily
on
the
couches
in
her
den.
I
describe
(with
much
detail)
the
stickiness
of
a
taxicab
seat
against
a
young
orphanOs
legs
as
she
gets
out
of
the
car
to
her
new
foster
home.
My
friend
sat
across
from
me
listening
attentively.
When
I
finished,
she
described
a
girl
waiting
for
her
very
first
kiss
from
a
boy
she
has
secretly
fallen
in
love
with.
The
next
Saturday
I
would
tell
her
a
horror
with
ambiguous
frightening
noises
coming
from
behind
a
window.
She
would
read
to
me
a
story
about
a
family
traveling
through
America
on
a
wagon
in
the
1800s.
We
spent
every
weekend
together.
Whether
it
was
a
sleepover
or
just
meeting
up
after
soccer
practice,
we
wrote
together
constantly.
Although
I
would
write
all
fiction,
she
liked
it
delve
into
historical
fiction
and
personal
narratives
as
well.
We
would
spend
the
whole
night
writing,
sitting
side
by
side
with
our
notebooks.
She
used
a
pen
and
wrote
in
a
slanting
script
I
couldnOt
read.
I
always
used
pencil
because
I
preferred
the
flexibility
of
it.
Due
to
changing
schools,
I
had
never
learned
how
to
write
in
script.
Instead,
I
wrote
everything
in
a
very
small
print.
After
awhile
we
would
stop,
and
read
whatever
we
had
written
to
the
other.
We
would
review
each
otherOs
stories
critically.
We
would
offer
suggestions
and
say
it
was
great
when
it
wasnOt.
By
sixth
grade
I
was
sneaking
into
my
parentOs
library,
and
had
graduated
to
O.
Henry
and
Roald
DahlOs
short
stories
for
adults.
(The
deception
was
mostly
unnecessary;
I
think
I
just
found
it
more
exciting
in
glimpsing
some
form
of
independence).
I
read
so
much
of
these
short
stories,
that
in
the
process
I
acquired
a
bit
of
their
black
humor,
surprise-ending
style.
My
writing
was
mildly
disturbed
in
its
nature
(as
would
anyoneOs
whose
reading
list
was
saturated
with
Roald
Dahl).
I
wrote
about
tattoo
removal,
salmonella,
island
natives
and
similar
things
I
could
only
imagine.
This
continued
until
the
end
of
middle
school.
With
high
school
came
commitments
and
new
friends.
Weekend
nights
became
less
and
less
reserved
for
writing
together,
and
more
for
movies,
other
friends,
and
eventually
boys
and
dates.
Before
high
school,
my
father
had
told
me
that
I
should
study
to
be
more
than
a
author,
as
it
was
much
too
hard
to
make
a
secure
living
without
another
occupation.
Writing
suddenly
became
a
hobby.
And
with
the
social,
sport,
and
academic
commitments
of
high
school,
hobbies
like
writing
all
but
disappeared.
Because
of
the
clear-cut
transition
into
high
school,
the
transition
to
not
writing
went
unnoticed.
When
I
did
think
of
it,
I
began
to
see
writing
as
a
phase
I
had
gone
through.
My
stories
all
seemed
childish
now.
The
family
got
a
new
computer,
and
I
got
my
own.
My
stories
were
reduced
to
a
floppy
disk
and
some
printouts
in
a
yellow
folder
on
the
bottom
of
my
bookshelf.
Senior
year
of
high
school,
my
English
teacher
had
us
each
write
a
story
with
no
set
parameters.
At
first
I
was
excited.
Despite
dropping
my
old
hobby,
I
had
retained
a
romanticized
perception
about
the
ease
of
the
writing
process.
Yet
by
the
time
I
was
home,
the
thought
of
composing
a
story
with
no
parameters
was
daunting.
I
stared
my
computer,
at
the
empty
notebook
pages
where
I
remembered
ideas
used
to
come
to
me
so
rapidly.
I
used
to
keep
a
special
notebook
just
for
ideas;
they
came
out
so
much
faster
than
I
could
ever
process
them
all.
I
found
this
old
notebook,
and
looked
through
it.
The
NideasO
were
one
word,
sometimes
two
or
three
strung
together.
Years
before
they
must
have
jigged
some
memory
and
made
perfect
sense.
Now
the
childish
handwriting
taunted
me
in
the
ambiguity
of
the
simple
words.
Eventually,
ironically,
it
was
my
childhood
that
I
turned
to
for
ideas.
That
same
childhood
that
I
deemed
too
boring
to
keep
a
diary
while
I
was
experiencing
it
was
the
only
part
of
my
life
that
seemed
remotely
interesting
enough
to
write
about
in
high
school.
I
ended
up
writing
a
story
about
a
man
who
had
tried
to
rob
our
house
in
South
Africa.
I
wrote
it
from
a
childOs
perspective;
the
words
flowed
out
of
me
with
the
same
ease
I
feel
when
I
write
essays
for
science
tests
I
have
prepared
too
well
for.
About
two
months
after
I
handed
it
in
my
teacher
approached
me.
She
told
me
she
had
sent
my
story
in
to
a
contest
at
Rider
University,
and
that
I
had
won
honorable
mention.
I
was
surprised
and
flattered.
I
gained
a
lot
of
confidence
with
my
writing,
yet
was
unable
to
show
the
story
to
my
parents
(despite
their
badgering).
Even
today,
when
I
have
become
much
more
comfortable
showing
my
parents
my
work,
I
am
still
unable
to
show
them
this
type
of
personal
narrative.
Whether
this
comes
with
time
or
maturity
(probably
both),
I
have
yet
to
achieve
this
level
of
openness
with
my
writing.
After
high
school,
I
started
keeping
a
journal
(as
my
father
had
suggested
many
years
ago).
It
actually
started
as
a
sketchbook.
I
tried
to
draw
every
day
at
college,
but
ultimately
it
ended
up
being
every
couple
days,
or
when
something
was
wrong.
After
awhile,
I
began
to
incorporate
words
into
my
drawings.
One
or
two
words
progressed
to
lyrics
from
songs
and
quotes
I
had
heard.
My
own
poetry
entered
the
page
with
shy
subtlety,
three
or
four
lines
on
the
bottom
corner
of
a
drawing.
Eventually
my
words
stretched
out
with
confidence
onto
the
page.
Instead
of
using
the
poetry
to
explain
the
artwork,
the
sketches
became
secondary
to
the
poems.
I
would
play
with
the
shape
of
the
poem
and
the
curvature
of
my
print.
I
finished
my
first
journal
ever
just
after
one
semester
of
college.
A
mix
of
sketches
and
poems,
I
had
become
completely
wrapped
up
in
my
own
writing.
Second
semester
I
took
a
creative
writing
class
that
had
us
keep
a
mandatory
journal.
I
started
by
writing
assignment
poems
in
there.
As
with
my
sketchbook,
I
found
it
much
easier
to
maintain
a
journal
when
there
was
a
foundation
(either
sketches
or
assigned
poems)
already
there.
Because
it
was
an
assignment,
I
found
it
much
easier
to
NmakeO
myself
work
on
my
journal
every
night.
As
with
previous
times,
I
was
heavily
influenced
by
my
reading.
Freshman
year
I
had
just
read
Arundhati
RoyOs
The
God
Of
Small
Things.
Immediately
a
favorite,
I
strained
to
attain
the
poetic
voice
that
was
prevalent
in
her
novel.
To
me,
she
achieved
the
ideal
blend
of
poetry
and
fiction
at
once.
She
was
by
far
the
biggest
influence
on
my
college
writing.
My
journal
often
mimicked
her
tendency
to
play
with
words.
Out
of
my
personal
comfort,
the
journal
began
with
just
poetry.
Eventually
it
became
longer
poetry,
and
poetry
of
different
types.
Once
or
twice
I
even
wrote
a
typical
Ndear
diaryO
style
journal
entry.
In
the
beginning
of
sophomore
year
I
started
a
new
journal,
and
wrote
in
it
for
a
long
time
before
dropping
it
entirely.
I
continued
to
write
in
small
bursts
for
the
rest
of
the
year.
Instead
of
a
steady
journal,
I
began
to
spend
much
more
time
on
my
writing
for
school.
With
grades
I
gained
confidence,
and
didnOt
mind
spending
the
time
to
uphold
the
grade
and
the
teacherOs
faith
in
my
ability.
Ultimately
I
realized
I
liked
even
assigned
writing.
I
liked
it
a
lot.
I
saw
it
as
a
break
from
studying
for
my
science
exams.
I
loved
VAST
because
it
was
such
a
change
from
my
science
schedule.
And
while
I
continue
to
find
the
sciences
very
interesting,
the
chance
to
express
myself
in
a
non-regurgitative
fashion
could
be
very
relieving.
Papers
became
something
not
only
that
I
could
do,
but
a
time
when
I
could
relax,
not
study,
and
just
manipulate
words.
On
a
personal
level,
I
feel
the
same
ease
and
excitement
about
writing
and
reading
now
as
I
did
in
sixth
grade
comparing
stories
on
my
friendOs
couch.
Grammatically
and
stylistically,
IOve
grown.
I
believe
the
most
significant
growth
has
been
the
ability
to
write
about
new
things
and
explore
new
genres.
I
do
realize
that
I
have
a
lot
of
room
for
growth
as
a
writer.
I
also
realize
that
this
growth
will
come
with
time,
maturity,
and
writing
more.
IOm
thinking
of
starting
a
journal.
