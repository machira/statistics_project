Writing
As
a
WA
Having
the
opportunity
to
be
a
Writing
Associate
last
semester
resulted
in
being
more
than
just
a
job
for
me.
Instead,
it
is
an
experience
that
has
contributed
to
my
character
as
a
person,
a
peer,
and
a
writer.
I
found
my
student
conferences
to
be
incredibly
rewarding
as
I
witnessed
many
students
come
to
realizations
about
their
writing
and
grow
as
writers
partly
as
a
result
of
my
guidance.
The
most
interesting
aspect
of
my
time
as
a
WA
is
that
it
was
also
a
learning
experience
for
me;
I
prospered
as
a
writer
along
with
my
students.
This
past
year
has
been
the
most
diverse
for
me
in
terms
of
my
history
as
a
writer.
Not
only
has
this
past
academic
year
proved
to
be
the
most
challenging,
but
it
was
also
a
period
of
great
growth
for
me
as
a
writer.
For
example,
in
the
fall,
I
wrote
political
theory
papers
for
the
Early
American
Political
Thought
course,
which
requires
much
practice
and
careful
consideration
of
all
of
the
rules
and
methods
to
writing
theory.
It
was
difficult
for
me,
at
first,
to
switch
gears
from
analytical
writing
to
following
all
of
the
structured
guidelines
and
style
of
a
political
theory
paper.
I
was
frustrated
after
the
first
two
papers,
but
I
was
able
to
overcome
this
by
seeking
help
and
guidance
from
my
professor.
I
learned
that
it
is
paramount
to
have
a
clear
understanding
of
the
assignment
so
that
you
can
enjoy
and
embrace
the
subject
more
deeply.
For
my
Political
Speech
in
America
class,
we
were
required
to
write
three
different
papers
using
three
different
methods
of
rhetorical
criticism,
which
I
did
not
even
know
existed
before
taking
this
course.
Writing
these
papers
correctly
required
extensive
research
on
how
to
analyze
a
piece
of
political
rhetoric
using
a
specific
method.
My
Literature
of
the
Holocaust
course
focused
on
thoughtful
criticism
of
other
writerOs
criticism
of
Holocaust
literature.
The
writing
consisted
of
finding
common
themes
in
different
styles
and
types
of
Holocaust
literature
and
analyzing
them.
For
example,
I
might
take
the
theme
of
fear
or
silence
in
Holocaust
literature
and
try
to
find
how
these
themes
are
used
in
different
places,
and
then
analyze
it
in
an
original
way.
The
writing
for
this
course
is
more
similar
to
the
type
of
writing
IOve
done
in
the
past;
however,
writing
about
rhetorical
criticism
in
the
political
speech
course
added
a
brand-new
concept
to
my
writing
repertoire.
I
also
took
the
Modern
and
Contemporary
Poetry
course,
where
I
found
that
writing
about
another
written
form,
like
poetry,
is
an
art
of
its
own.
It
not
only
requires
knowledge
of
the
poem
and
poetical
form,
but
also
of
how
to
effectively
write
about
it
and
convey
it
to
the
audience.
It
has
a
separate
set
of
literary
terms
and
requires
a
different
angle
of
analysis.
Again,
this
is
a
genre
of
writing
I
did
not
have
much
previous
experience
with,
which
made
it
a
challenge.
A
piece
of
advice
to
both
students
and
Writing
Associates
is
that
seeking
out
the
professorOs
guidance
is
the
best
thing
to
do
when
you
OarenOt
sure.O
Often
times
all
it
takes
is
the
professor
to
explain
and
describe
the
assignment
in
different
words
for
it
to
click
and
for
you
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
what
he
or
she
is
looking
for.
All
of
the
writing
assignments
in
each
of
my
courses
last
fall
taught
me
to
narrow
down
my
focus
and
to
really
delve
into
one
aspect
of
the
topic
instead
of
briefly
touching
upon
many
different
ideas.
There
seems
to
be
different
sets
of
rules
for
each
form
and
genre
of
writing,
which
are
difficult
to
keep
straight;
therefore,
I
find
myself
breaking
certain
rules
that
are
absolute
for
one
genre,
but
not
for
another.
In
the
spring,
I
participated
in
the
Washington
Journalism
Semester
Program
through
American
University
in
Washington,
DC.EEFor
this
program
is
did
an
extensive
amount
of
journalistic
writing,
which
I
have
no
prior
experience
in,
so
again
it
was
a
challenge.E
Journalistic
writing
is
good
practice
for
writing
succinctlyEandEclearly;
it
really
puts
the
Oless
is
moreO
concept
into
practice.
What
I
found
most
difficult
about
this
kind
of
writing
is
the
absence
of
analysis
and
theory;
instead
journalistic
writing
is
very
raw
and
aims
to
be
unbiased
in
order
to
let
the
reader
draw
their
own
conclusions.
One
way
to
make
it
more
interesting
is
by
being
concise
and
detail
oriented
in
a
way
that
paints
a
clear
and
vivid
picture
for
the
reader.E
During
the
Washington
Journalism
semester,
I
gained
new
experience
in
journalistic
writing,
as
well
as
research-based
writing.E
I
participated
in
a
research
seminar
in
which
I
wrote
a
50-page
research
paper
on
the
topic
of
privatizing
Social
Security.
The
discipline
of
research
projects
requires
a
lot
of
time
management,
planning,
and
organization,
as
well
as
a
true
interest
in
the
topic
being
written
about.
In
terms
of
journalistic
writing
I
hadEthe
opportunity
to
write
about
everything
from
national
and
political
news,
to
book
reviews,
to
lifestyle
features
and
medical
articles.E
The
important,
keyEquestion
that
I
learned
to
askEwhen
writing
about
all
of
these
topics
is
Owhat
is
the
angle?OE
The
writing
cannot
just
be
a
summary
of
the
topic,
but
instead
the
writer
orEjournalist,
in
this
case,
needs
to
find
something
special
and
specific
toEelaborate
on
and
present
it
in
a
new
and
unique
way.
Something
else
I
learned
through
journalistic
writing
is
how
to
handle
short,
tight
deadlines.E
Journalists
have
to
first
uncover
the
story,
find
the
angle,
and
then
write
about
it
in
usually
no
more
than
24
hours.
This
was
a
challenge
for
me,
personally,
seeing
as
how
I
am
used
to
having
at
least
one
weekOs
notice
before
a
deadline,
as
well
as
a
clear
assignment.E
Journalism
isEa
much
more
independent
type
of
writingEthat
requires
a
lot
of
energy
and
a
lot
of
self-motivation
because
the
assignment
is
not
just
written
outEon
a
syllabus
for
you,
instead
it
is
undiscovered,
out
there
in
the
world
somewhere.E
Because
of
these
tight
deadlines,
there
is
notEmuch
time
for
revision,
yet
proofEreading
is
one
of
the
most
important
steps
in
journalism.E
One
of
the
rules
my
journalism
professor
enforced
was
that
if
there
were
any
misspelled
words
in
our
articles,
our
grade
would
decrease
by
one
point
and
we
would
not
be
able
to
re-write
it.E
This
is
a
good
strategy
for
careful
proofreading,
but
for
an
overly
worried
student,
it
can
put
too
much
emphasis
on
checking
for
spelling
mistakes
and
not
enough
focus
on
the
overall
quality
of
the
writing.
During
the
spring
semester
and
this
summer
I
had
an
internship
with
the
Hardball
with
Chris
Matthews
Show
on
MSNBC
in
Washington,
DC.
Through
this
internship
I
not
only
learned
about
television
production,
but
I
also
learned
about
writing
for
broadcast
news.
There
is
extensive
proofreading
and
editing;
all
of
the
written
material
for
the
scripts
is
reviewed
by
at
least
two
other
producers
before
it
goes
on
air.
Then,
the
script
goes
to
the
host,
Chris
Matthews,
who
usually
makes
changes,
and
the
producers
then
edit
those
changes,
again.
This
goes
to
show
that
even
the
professionals
need
their
work
checked
by
their
peers.
All
of
these
new
experiences
have
greatly
influenced
me,
but
working
as
a
WA
last
year
also
played
a
huge
role
in
shaping
me
into
the
writer
I
am
today.
Because
of
my
WA
experiences,
I
see
writing
as
a
process,
or
a
professional
art,
and
I
approach
it
in
such
a
way.
As
a
WA,
I
have
learned
more
about
the
process,
function,
and
purpose
of
writing,
which
gives
me
a
greater
appreciation
for
it.
In
turn,
I
have
a
higher
sense
of
accomplishment
when
I
complete
a
writing
project.
One
important
realization
I
made
through
my
writing
experiences
over
this
past
year,
is
that
I
never
really
had
to
think
very
hard
about
the
type
of
writing
I
was
doing,
only
the
subject
matter.
However,
through
my
own
classes
and
through
the
Writing
Associate
experience
of
having
to
acquaint
myself
quickly
with
the
style
of
writing
of
the
student
and
the
style
of
the
professorsO
assignments,
I
have
become
a
much
more
diversified
and
conscious
writer
and
critical
reader.
Not
only
am
I
constantly
aware
of
style,
format,
grammar,
clarity,
etc.
in
the
papers
I
read,
but
also
in
my
own
writing.
When
reading
a
studentOs
paper
as
a
WA,
it
can
sometimes
seem
overwhelming
because
I
feel
like
I
have
to
look
at
and
comment
on
every
aspect
of
that
particular
piece
of
writing.
My
advice
to
new
WAOs
is
to
first
read
the
assignment
thoroughly.
Then,
do
a
first
read
through
of
the
paper
without
stopping
to
make
any
comments
in
order
to
get
the
gist
of
the
content
and
the
assignment
as
a
whole.
On
the
second
read,
choose
one
criteria,
such
as
sentence
structure,
organization,
thesis,
support
and
evidence,
etc.
to
focus
on.
Next,
go
back
and
look
for
the
other
criteria.
If
you
notice
spelling
and
grammar
mistakes,
comment
on
them,
but
do
not
make
it
the
focus
or
number
one
priority
of
your
comments
and
time.
I
suggest
this
because
it
can
be
somewhat
overwhelming
to
try
to
look
for
everything
all
at
once,
especially
if
the
paper
needs
a
lot
of
work;
therefore,
take
it
one
step
at
a
time.
This
advice
can
also
be
applied
to
your
own
writing.
Sitting
down
to
a
new
assignment
and
a
blank
page
can
be
intimidating
and
daunting,
even
for
the
best
of
writers,
but
if
you
do
it
in
steps
and
start
out
with
brainstorming
or
an
outline,
then
it
will
quickly
begin
to
take
shape
and
not
seem
so
difficult
after
all.
Another
important
lesson
I
learned
is
that
clear
and
direct
language
is
better
than
elaborate
and
flowery
language.
Good
writing
is
that
which
gets
to
the
point
clearly
and
effectively
rather
than
using
complicated
vocabulary
and
sentence
structure
in
an
attempt
to
sound
more
scholarly.
As
a
result
of
being
a
Writing
Associate,
I
have
noticed
that
the
questions
I
ask
of
my
professors
about
my
own
writing
assignments
are
much
more
pointed
and
specific
because
I
am
more
aware
of
the
type
of
finished
product
I
want;
therefore,
I
will
ask
appropriate
questions
to
help
me
get
to
that
final
product.
When
it
comes
to
reading
studentsO
work
and
meeting
with
them,
a
WA
must
keep
an
open
mind
and
expect
the
unexpected.
At
first,
I
just
assumed
that
everyone
writes
like
I
do
and
that
everyone
has
had
the
same
writing
background
and
interest
in
writing,
but
that
is
not
the
case.
Every
student
is
different
and
a
WA
must
be
prepared
to
conference
with
students
with
a
strong
writing
history,
writers
with
less
experience,
and
everything
in
between.
It
was
at
first,
and
I
think
it
still
is,
somewhat
difficult
to
give
out
advice
to
other
writers
because
I
know
that
I
do
not
know
everything,
and
I
am
still
a
student
who
has
a
lot
to
learn
about
writing;
therefore,
sometimes
instinctively
I
feel
like
it
is
not
my
place
to
advise
other
writers
my
age
who
may
even
have
more
talent
as
a
writer
than
I
do.
The
way
to
overcome
this
psychological
challenge
is
to
recognize
this
and
know
that
any
constructive
advice
you
have
for
a
peer
is
worthy
and
helpful,
and
they
can
take
it
or
leave
it
as
they
see
fit
for
their
own
personal
style.
I
often
turned
to
a
fellow
WA,
who
is
a
veteran
of
the
program,
for
guidance
when
I
was
faced
with
a
new
situation
with
a
student
or
professor
that
I
felt
I
needed
another
perspective
on.
These
types
of
situations
include,
a
stubborn
student
who
is
not
open
to
advice,
a
student
who
continually
misses
WA
conferences,
or
miscommunications
between
the
professor
and
the
students.
Just
as
it
is
helpful
for
peers
to
read
your
work,
it
is
also
helpful
to
get
fellow
WAOs
WA-ing
advice
because
they
may
approach
the
situation
with
a
different
perspective
and
therefore
a
different
solution
than
you
may
have
considered.
Therefore,
I
would
encourage
new
WAOs
to
keep
open
lines
of
communication
with
other
WAOs
and
not
to
hesitate
to
ask
for
help
or
advice.
In
order
to
write
as
a
WA,
at
least
in
the
way
I
have
done,
you
should
write
with
clarity
and
with
a
voice
of
confidence.
A
WA
should
also
be
well
acquainted
with
the
Saint
MartinOs
Handbook
for
many
reasons,
but
especially
to
accurately
cite
sources.
A
WA
should
stay
focused
in
their
by
referring
back
to
their
thesis
and
by
only
using
important
quotations
or
paraphrasing
that
supports
the
argument.
A
WA
should
always
explain
the
importance
of
the
quotations
used
and
instead
of
trying
to
showcase
everything
you
know,
and
a
WA
should
narrow
the
focus
and
go
further
with
one
idea
or
argument.
Lastly,
a
WA
should
be
a
good
example
for
other
writers
by
never,
ever
plagiarizing.
Also,
with
my
previous
experience
as
a
WA,
I
have
found
that
writing
in
small
chunks
helps
me
get
started
on
a
paper.
Something
else
that
helps
is
to
leave
the
paper
in
mid-sentence
so
that
you
can
return
to
it
and
pick
up
where
you
left
off
without
any
writerOs
block.
Most
importantly,
WAOs
should
always
proofread
their
own
work
and
have
other
people
read
it,
as
well.
In
order
to
be
a
good
WA
in
your
conferences,
you
should
let
the
student
do
most
of
the
talking
and
get
them
to
ask
you
questions.
First,
let
them
explain
their
understanding
of
the
assignment
to
you
and
let
them
tell
you
what
they
feel
is
good
about
their
writing
and
what
they
think
needs
work.
Also,
as
a
WA,
you
need
to
be
critical,
but
encouraging
of
their
work
and
progress,
so
that
the
student
leaves
the
conference
feeling
confident
and
motivated
to
improve
their
paper.
What
is
my
identity
as
a
writer?E
I
do
not
yet
have
a
definitive
answer
for
this
question
because
I
feel
that
I
am
still
developing
as
a
writer.E
Throughout
a
lifetime,
a
writer
continues
to
have
new
experiences
and
grow
as
a
result;
therefore,
I
think
that
every
writer
their
own
unique
identity,
but
they
should
not
be
pinned
down
or
stereotyped
into
having
just
one
identity
as
a
writer.
I
have
learned
thatEone
writer
can
wear
many
different
hats
and
experiment
with
many
different
styles.E
For
example,
he/she
may
be
an
investigative,
unbiased
journalist
one
day,
and
an
opinionated
columnist
the
next.E
Writing
can
be
a
profession
and
a
livelihood,
or
a
freelance
hobby,
or
a
therapeutic
means
of
expression,
or
a
way
of
keeping
in
touch
with
people.E
Most
importantly,
the
written
form
is
one
of
the
oldest
and
widely
used
forms
of
communication
without
which
we
would
all
be
very
out
of
touch
and,
perhaps
be
living
in
a
state
of
ignorance,
alienation,
and
chaos.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
has
given
me
more
insight
into
othersO
writing,
especially
my
own,
and
it
has
given
me
a
greater
appreciation
for
the
art
of
writing
itself.
I
welcome
the
new
Writing
AssociateOs
into
the
WA
family
and
to
this
new
journey
that
they
are
about
to
embark
on
in
their
writing.
