WA
Pre-Training
Paper
One
could
say
that
I
have
been
writing
since
the
moment
in
my
childhood
when
I
shifted
from
drawing
crayon
pictures
of
stick-people
and
houses
to
scribbling
letters
on
construction
paper.
I
wrote
at
that
point,
but
I
wasnOt
really
writing
in
the
way
that
I
understand
writing
now.
From
those
first
few
letters
(MOs
probably)
I
learned
to
make
words,
sentences,
paragraphs,
and
eventually
papers.
Writing
is
a
process
of
using
those
words
and
letters
to
create
meaning
and
express
ideas.
As
simple
as
it
may
sound,
learning
how
to
write
well
is
a
lifelong
process.
There
are
so
many
different
styles
and
methods
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
become
an
expert
in
all
of
them.
Writing
is
a
process
of
growth
where
the
writer
expands
his
knowledge
by
practicing
and
being
instructed.
Although
there
are
many
different
writing
styles,
there
are
common
patterns
and
skills
that
can
apply
across
genres.
I
was
taught
these
ideas
and
genres
by
professors,
high
school
teachers,
books,
peers,
family,
and
many
others.
Each
paper
and
interaction
shaped
the
writer
that
I
am
today,
often
in
surprising
ways.
In
my
school
district
all
of
the
students
were
required,
beginning
in
fourth
grade,
to
put
three
samples
of
writing
in
a
folder
each
year
that
followed
us
all
of
the
way
through
high
school.
At
the
end
of
senior
English,
the
folder
was
returned
to
us,
so
I
now
have
a
partially
complete
record
of
my
favorite
and
best
writings
throughout
my
school
years.
This
valuable
folder
chronicles
the
story
of
my
development
from
the
first
emergence
of
sentences
and
paragraphs
all
the
way
to
my
senior
year
research
paper.
Although
I
wrote
during
my
early
elementary
school
classes,
I
learned
the
most
about
writing
in
fourth
grade.
There
is
at
least
one
notable
piece
of
writing
that
I
have
from
my
fourth
grade
year
that
illustrates
my
growing
writing
skill.
During
the
Halloween
season
in
fourth
grade
we
were
challenged
to
write
a
scary
story.
We
read
our
tales
aloud
to
the
class
around
a
plug-in
fireplace
supplied
by
our
teacher.
My
story
featured
a
metamorphosing
pumpkin
and
a
midnight
journey
to
a
graveyard.
The
story
included
a
line
that
by
itself
is
not
very
impressive,
but
it
does
represent
a
significant
development
of
my
writing
skills.
NI
went
downstairs,
being
sure
to
miss
the
third
step
from
the
bottom
because
it
creaked.O
I
remember
writing
this
story
and
that
I
had
once
read
a
similar
line
in
a
book
and
liked
the
dramatic
impact
that
it
had
on
the
story.
I
thought
that
it
made
the
tale
seem
much
more
realistic,
and
I
made
a
point
of
incorporating
a
similar
style
into
my
own
story.
This
marked,
the
first
time
in
my
memory
at
least,
that
I
had
used
what
I
had
learned
from
all
the
books
I
read
to
improve
my
own
writing.
Eventually,
I
became
much
more
adept
at
understanding
how
reading
good
books
can
teach
a
writer
important
things
about
how
to
write
a
with
a
good
style.
It
is
impossible
to
be
a
good
writer
without
being
a
passionate
reader.
Other
peopleOs
writings
can
inspire
and
teach
us
about
which
techniques
work
and
which
do
not
for
writing.
Of
course,
I
have
read
Shakespeare
and
I
have
not
become
a
world-renowned
poet,
but
taking
tips
from
the
best
has
certainly
improved
my
writing
since
I
first
wrote
about
a
possessed
vegetables.
Middle
school
saw
less
dramatic
growth
in
my
writing
than
in
previous
or
subsequent
years,
but
it
did
illustrate
the
impact
that
events
in
my
life
had
on
my
writing.
During
this
period
I
was
faced
with
a
new
host
of
problems,
from
troubles
making
friends
in
the
new
environment
to
my
parents
going
through
a
divorce.
In
response
to
the
stresses
of
reality
I
retreated
deeper
and
deeper
into
fantasy
worlds,
which
caused
my
creativity
to
grow.
I
began
to
devour
fantasy
books
more
than
any
other
genre
and
spent
my
time
dreaming
up
alternate
worlds
and
exciting
adventures.
A
lot
of
my
writings
from
this
time
were
long;
several
stories
I
wrote
in
sixth
grade
were
up
to
6
typed
pages,
which
seemed
huge
to
a
12
year
old,
but
I
had
such
a
great
time
writing
them
that
it
was
hard
to
stop.
Sixth
grade
was
the
year
my
English
class
focused
more
on
creative
writing
than
anything
else
and
it
was
no
coincidence
that
I
liked
that
class
the
most.
Among
others,
I
wrote
an
adventure
story
about
a
boy
living
in
ancient
Greece
who
was
kidnapped
from
his
home
and
taken
to
an
island
far
away.
He
traveled
all
across
the
island
looking
for
a
way
home,
and
eventually
the
story
ends
with
him
triumphantly
sailing
home.
Another
fantasy
story
is
about
an
Atlantean
boy
who
found
a
magic
dragonOs
egg,
and
had
to
deal
with
all
of
the
troubles
of
having
a
fully-fledged
baby
dragon
living
in
his
house.
Looking
back,
the
stories
are
not
exactly
masterpieces,
but
I
remember
truly
enjoying
writing
them,
and,
as
I
remarked
on
a
note
in
my
writing
folder,
I
loved
thoroughly
describing
these
new
places;
the
colors,
the
sights,
and
the
smells
of
ancient
Greece
or
mythical
Atlantis.
I
could
see
these
mythical
lands
in
my
mind
and
I
wanted
to
translate
them
so
well
that
they
would
be
as
lucid
to
the
reader
as
they
were
to
me.
I
was
especially
encouraged
by
the
positive
feedback
my
teacher
gave
me
about
my
descriptions.
Although
eventually
I
had
to
begin
writing
more
NseriousO
pieces,
my
love
of
writing
creative
fiction
continued,
at
least
through
the
beginning
of
high
school.
In
tenth
grade
I
wrote
several
background
essays
exploring
the
lives
of
characters
before
they
appeared
in
the
novels
that
we
read
for
class.
I
even
wrote
a
play
for
my
final
project
in
11th
grade
about
two
brothers
dealing
with
the
conflicts
and
competition
between
them.
These
bouts
of
creative
writing
stretched
my
imagination
and
trained
me
to
be
more
imaginative
in
other
forms
of
writing,
which
would
come
in
handy
in
many
other
writing
projects
in
the
future,
even
dry
research
papers.
On
a
more
personal
level
I
learned
the
importance
that
oneOs
own
personality
and
life
can
have
on
writing
and
how
writing
can
be
a
reflective
tool
as
much
as
a
school
assignment.
My
senior
year
of
high
school
marked
the
most
dramatic
growth
in
my
writing
skills
since
fourth
grade.
The
new
writing
styles
I
was
exposed
to
helped
to
prepare
me
for
college
level
writing.
Previously,
most
of
my
English
teachers
focused
on
teaching
us
vocabulary
words
or
making
us
read
lots
of
stories,
but
in
my
senior
year
we
were
taught
how
to
analyze
things
we
had
read.
Mrs.
Watson
assigned
a
paper
every
week,
and
each
one
featured
a
new
style
of
writing:
authorial
style
analysis,
poetry
scansions,
persuasive
papers
and
many
others.
At
first
I,
along
with
the
rest
of
the
class,
was
not
fond
of
having
to
write
a
paper
several
pages
long
each
week;
it
was
practically
torture
during
our
Nsenioritis.O
Eventually,
I
got
into
the
rhythm
and
really
began
to
enjoy
learning
new
ways
to
structure
papers,
formulate
arguments,
and
explore
readings.
I
was
shocked
to
find
out
that
I
could
come
up
with
better
analysis
of
works
while
writing
than
I
could
from
just
sitting
and
thinking
about
what
I
had
read.
While
I
typed
my
thoughts,
new
ideas
came
to
me,
and
papers
became
a
pallet
for
examining
and
mixing
ideas.
Mrs.
Watson
was
a
tough
but
fair
grader
and
each
week
I
did
all
I
could
to
improve
on
my
previous
grade.
As
I
went
through
my
paper
and
edited
with
my
red
pen
I
made
notes,
drew
lines,
rearranged
structures
and
wrote
critical
or
encouraging
comments
to
myself.
For
the
first
time
I
felt
that
I
was
crafting
a
paper,
as
opposed
to
just
completing
an
assignment
or
trying
to
come
up
with
a
good
story.
I
took
pride
in
how
my
paper
was
structured,
in
its
clarity
and
its
arguments.
Of
course,
Mrs.
Watson
believed
that
we
still
had
more
to
learn
before
college,
and
to
that
end
she
assigned
a
long,
intensive
research
paper.
It
was
common
procedure
to
write
a
research
paper
in
every
English
class
since
7th
grade,
but
this
one
was
unique.
Not
only
because
its
length
seemed
enormous
to
us
as
high
school
students,
but
also
because
it
was
to
be
more
than
just
regurgitating
information
that
we
reasearched
in
other
books.
We
actually
had
to
combine
the
information
with
some
sort
of
theme
or
analysis.
I
had
never
done
a
research
project
like
this,
so
I
was
naturally
a
little
overwhelmed.
Fortunately,
Mrs.
Watson
guided
us
through
every
step
and
showed
us
how
to
incorporate
the
analysis
techniques
that
we
learned
from
our
weekly
papers
with
the
information
that
we
gleaned
from
our
sources
to
develop
something
completely
novel:
our
own
arguments.
I
did
not
enjoy
every
part
of
writing
an
analysis
of
Victor
HugoOs
life
and
its
impact
on
his
writings,
although
I
did
learn
a
lot
about
combining
research
with
good
analysis,
and
the
project
has
shaped
my
writing
ever
since.
I
owe
Mrs.
Watson
much
gratitude
for
teaching
me
techniques
to
make
a
paper
go
from
a
high
school
project
to
real
academic
writing.
Until
this
point,
I
have
only
explored
the
impact
that
assignments
for
English
classes
have
had
on
my
writing,
but
I
learned
from
a
memorable
teacher
during
my
high
school
career
that
writing
stretches
into
many
other
areas
of
study.
Mr.
Brosius
was
the
most
infamous
teachers
in
my
high
school.
His
reputation
for
challenging
classes,
lengthy
assignments,
and
numerous
lab
reports
and
essays
was
widely
known.
When
I
took
my
first
class
with
Mr.
Brosius,
the
idea
of
writing
about
science
was
completely
new
to
me.
I
knew
enough
about
writing
about
literature
and
history
but
I
had
no
idea
how
one
could
write
science
essays.
Mr.
Brosius
insisted
that
we
did
not
fully
understand
the
concepts
he
taught
until
we
could
take
the
themes
and
facts
and
apply
them
to
real
situations,
and
the
best
way
to
do
that
was
through
essay
tests.
The
class
was
terrified
of
Mr.
Brosius,
or
rather
his
tests,
and
students
were
willing
to
believe
anything
about
him-
after
all
he
was
a
constant
subject
of
unverified
rumors,
from
shoe-throwing
tantrums
to
pyrotechnic
explosions
in
his
lab
(all
of
which
he
vehemently
denied).
Fearing
the
worst
on
every
test,
we
would
spend
hours
studying
and
preparing,
making
outlines
and
planning
responses
to
every
potential
question,
but
each
time
there
was
something
that
caught
a
student
by
surprise,
an
essay
that
she
had
not
prepared
for
or
a
concept
he
didnOt
remember.
However
stressful
it
was
to
be
in
his
class,
I
learned
from
Mr.
Brosius
how
important
writing
is
to
expressing
ideas
or
explaining
scientific
principles.
Before
him,
I
never
understood
that
the
function
of
the
kidneys
could
be
just
as
easily
explained
in
writing
as
through
a
diagram,
or
that
in
a
report
on
limnology,
accuracy
of
information
can
be
as
important
as
writing
style.
Scientific
writing
is
not
my
expertise,
but
since
Mr.
Brosius
introduced
me
to
it
I
have
come
to
understand
how
necessary
writing
can
be
to
any
field,
and
I
have
improved
my
ability
to
write
with
more
facts
and
fewer
opinions.
Teachers,
professors,
and
students
frequently
talk
about
the
difficulty
in
the
transition
from
high
school
work
to
college
level
academics.
To
the
average
high
school
student,
college
writing
seems
to
be
on
a
totally
different
level.
It
appears
to
be
a
sort
of
mystery,
a
different
level
of
communication
and
scholarship
that
is
indecipherable
for
high
school
students.
Constantly
warned
that
college
work
would
be
incredibly
difficult,
I
was
a
little
apprehensive
to
begin
my
first
major
college
writing
projects,
including
research
papers
for
my
politics
and
history
classes.
I
felt
that
despite
my
teachersO
best
attempts
I
was
not
prepared
for
this
type
of
work-
after
all
I
had
just
graduated
from
a
rural
high
school.
Could
I
really
handle
college?
Fortunately,
one
of
the
unique
challenges
in
my
college
life
is
that
I
never
have
enough
time
to
procrastinate
so
I
jumped
into
my
projects
without
hesitation.
My
professors
did
an
excellent
job
of
guiding
us
through
the
first
steps,
especially
in
my
first
year
seminar
course,
where
the
professor
was
well
aware
that
many
of
the
students
were
not
familiar
with
college
writing.
My
first
year
seminar
also
gave
me
my
first
introduction
the
WA
program
and
serious
peer
editing.
In
high
school
the
only
person
who
edited
my
work
before
I
submitted
it
was
myself
and
occasionally
my
parents.
I
did
not
really
understand
the
value
of
having
someone
else
read
my
work
and
give
me
advice.
At
first
I
thought
the
WA
meetings
were
unnecessary
but
when
my
WA
started
to
give
me
important
information
about
college
writing
I
began
to
see
the
relevance
of
the
meetings.
For
example,
I
relieved
heavily
on
my
WA
to
explain
to
me
what
exactly
an
annotated
bibliography
needed
to
include,
and
to
help
me
understand
what
the
professor
required
on
each
assignment,
like
our
genocide
analysis
paper,
where
the
vagueness
of
the
requirements
left
me
totally
lost.
With
the
help
of
professors,
WAs,
and
a
lot
of
work
I
proved
to
myself
that
I
could
succeed
at
writing
in
a
college
environment.
College
represented
a
large
growth
for
my
writing
skills.
It
tested
my
ability
to
do
quality
writing
in
a
short
amount
of
time
and
gave
me
a
new
confidence
in
my
writing
when
I
succeeded.
It
taught
me
new
ways
to
think
and
approach
problems.
My
experience
with
the
WA
program
taught
me
the
value
of
having
someone
bring
a
new
perspective
to
editing
a
paper.
A
new
challenge
that
eventually
became
a
learning
opportunity
presented
itself
soon
after
I
entered
college.
In
high
school,
I
dabbled
in
our
schoolOs
newspaper,
it
was
only
published
a
few
times
a
year,
but
occasionally
I
would
help
my
friend
who
was
the
editor
by
writing
a
story.
When
I
came
to
Lafayette
I
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
try
something
new
and
actually
be
part
of
a
newspaper
staff,
so
I
signed
up
for
The
Lafayette.
I
was
nervous
at
first,
since
I
had
never
written
a
serious
newspaper
article,
and
after
a
few
weeks
hesitation
I
decided
it
was
time
to
try
my
hand
at
writing
instead
of
just
sitting
and
listening
at
the
meetings.
My
first
assignment
was
a
story
about
Nnutty
professorsO
at
Lafayette.
My
job
was
to
indentify
some
really
unusual
professors
and
find
some
roundabout
way
to
encourage
them
to
talk
about
their
weird
characteristics.
The
project
was
frustrating
for
me
because
I
had
no
idea
how
to
structure
the
article
or
conduct
the
interview.
I
was
glad
just
to
be
rid
of
it
when
I
handed
it
in
to
my
editor.
Unfortunately,
my
editor
decided
that
meeting
would
also
be
a
good
time
to
review
writing
style
and
do
some
Npeer-reviews.O
Naturally,
my
article
was
the
one
she
used
as
an
example
to
edit
with
the
group.
Although
my
name
was
removed,
I
was
still
pretty
devastated
to
hear
my
peers
criticizing
my
paper,
every
comment
seemed
like
a
personal
blow.
From
misplaced
semicolons
to
incorrect
style,
my
article
became
an
example
for
everyone
else
about
how
not
to
write
a
newspaper
article.
I
was
crushed
after
that
night.
While
I
doubt
anyone
intended
to
do
any
more
than
provide
helpful
tips,
I
was
not
used
to
having
my
writing
critiqued
by
that
many
people.
I
felt
very
self-conscious
about
it.
My
article
was
not
published
in
that
weeks
issue,
and
I
was
told
it
needed
some
major
work.
Although
I
had
never
expected
my
first
foray
into
journalistic
writing
to
be
a
resounding
success,
I
was
not
used
to
critical
feedback
D
especially
regarding
my
writing.
Rather
than
giving
up,
I
soon
realized
that
in
order
to
redeem
myself,
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do:
learn
how
to
write
good
newspaper
articles.
Eventually
I
figured
out
the
formula
with
a
lot
of
practice
and
help
from
daily
readings
of
the
New
York
Times.
I
even
began
to
enjoy
working
on
the
newspaper
and
researching
a
new
subject
every
week.
I
learned
more
from
my
experience,
however,
than
writing
leads.
I
gained
important
skills
that
are
easily
translated
to
other
academic
areas.
Learning
brevity
helped
rein
in
my
wandering
sentences
and
paragraphs.
I
also
learned
how
to
simplify
complex
ideas,
like
wind-power
credits
to
something
that
can
be
easily
understood.
My
writing
had
a
purpose,
and
that
through
my
work
I
could
help
the
Lafayette
community
become
better
informed
about
their
campus.
Newspaper,
I
believe,
represents
the
biggest
potential
for
the
expansion
of
my
writing
skills
into
new
styles
and
areas
and
I
am
looking
forward
to
getting
more
experience
in
writing
and
editing
articles.
There
are
also
numerous
other
areas
in
which
my
writing
needs
improvement,
and
I
know
that
as
I
continue
my
education
and
grow
older
I
will
continue
to
learn
more
about
writing.
Events
in
my
life
my
change
the
way
I
write
or
what
I
like
to
write,
either
for
good
or
bad,
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
each
shift
in
my
writing
style,
however,
imperceptible
will
be
due
to
some
one
or
something
having
an
impact
on
me.
