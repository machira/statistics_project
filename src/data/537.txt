My
earliest
memory
of
writing
comes
from
my
experience
in
first
grade.
Having
learned
the
alphabet
and
struggled
with
phonics
in
kindergarten,
my
first
attempts
to
write
in
my
first
grade
journal
were
both
nerve-wrecking
and
exciting.
Writing
was
exciting
in
that
I
could
put
down
on
paper
anything
I
wanted,
from
a
trip
to
the
beach
to
playing
a
game
with
my
Dad.
It
was
nerve-wrecking
in
that
I
had
trouble
reading
and
many
other
children
were
reading
entire
books
out
loud
to
the
class.
I
remember
wanting
to
write
about
my
play
dates
at
my
friend
CristinOs
house
and
all
about
my
baby
sister
Meghan.
At
the
age
of
six,
I
used
pencils
as
my
writing
medium,
accompanied
by
crayons
illustrating
what
I
had
written.
As
grammar
school
continued,
so
did
journals
detailing
my
days,
favorite
activities,
and
special
events.
Third
grade,
I
remember
making
the
switch
to
erasable
pens,
which
I
continued
to
use
up
until
sophomore
year
of
high
school.
Erasable
pens
were
key
when
learning
cursive
because
many
mistakes
were
made.
In
addition,
erasable
pens,
like
pencils
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
revise
my
writing.
There
was
no
sense
of
permanency
when
it
came
to
my
writing.
If
I
wanted
to
make
changes,
erasing
letters,
words,
or
paragraphs
ensured
that
I
could
try
again
in
expressing
my
ideas.
Moving
from
print
to
cursive
was
another
mixed
experience
in
writing.
Always
wanting
to
be
a
perfectionist,
my
cursive
had
to
be
the
best.
Yet,
the
dozens
upon
dozens
of
exercises
that
I
had
to
complete
in
my
handwriting
books
made
this
task
difficult.
In
my
class,
students
were
rewarded
for
completing
a
certain
amount
of
pages
in
these
books,
and
thus,
efficiency
more
than
quality
seemed
to
be
important.
Finishing
five
pages
of
uppercase
and
lower
AOs
meant
that
we
had
less
work
to
complete
at
home
that
night,
and
what
eight
year
old
would
want
more
work?
Fourth
grade
was
the
first
time
that
I
was
required
to
write
a
book
report
for
class.
My
teacher
made
a
list
of
guidelines
detailing
exactly
what
was
expected
from
my
class
as
well
as
a
list
of
accepted
books
for
the
report.
The
book
I
chose
was
The
Enormous
Egg
by
Oliver
Butterworth.
A
long
read,
The
Enormous
Egg,
at
the
time,
seemed
like
a
hard
book
to
tackle
for
my
first
report.
My
teacher
requested
character
descriptions
as
well
as
a
summary
and
analysis
of
the
book.
With
several
characters
and
a
long
and
involved
storyline,
it
seemed
impossible
for
me
to
condense
the
story
into
a
book
report.
With
the
help
of
my
mom
and
after
several
revisions,
I
wrote
one
of
the
longest
fourth
grade
book
reports.
The
summary
alone
was
around
ten
pages
hand-written
and
the
character
descriptions
were
at
least
four
pages.
When
my
report
was
returned,
my
teacher
praised
my
efforts.
She
wrote
things
such
as
NGreat
jobO
and
NGood
attention
to
detail.O
While
I
loved
the
praise
and
grade
I
received,
I
can
honestly
say
that
this
first
book
report
began
my
aversion
to
writing
book
reports.
From
then
on,
it
was
a
grueling
task
to
try
to
summarize
hundreds
of
pages
of
a
book
that
most
of
the
time
I
didnOt
like.
Also,
completing
book
reports
in
addition
to
working
on
math
problems
and
science
projects
made
me
anxious
and
prone
to
procrastination.
In
fifth
grade,
each
student
in
my
history
class
had
to
complete
a
report
detailing
a
certain
event
that
took
place
in
American
history.
I
chose
AmericaOs
victory
at
Yorktown
during
the
Revolutionary
War.
Using
four
different
books,
I
compiled
and
summarized
the
major
players
and
chronicled
the
events
during
the
Battle
of
Yorktown.
I
also
included
pictures
of
the
battlefield,
the
triumphant
General
Washington
and
the
defeated
General
Cornwallis.
Writing
this
report
spurred
my
interest
in
history
that
I
still
hold
today.
Researching
the
past
and
learning
about
important
places
and
people
and
then
writing
about
it
in
my
own
words
excited
me
in
a
way
that
writing
never
had
before.
Entering
the
sixth
grade
at
my
school,
Our
Lady
of
Sorrows,
meant
not
only
a
change
in
teachers,
but
also
a
different
atmosphere
and
higher
expectations.
Sixth
through
eighth
graders
were
expected
to
give
one
hundred
percent
and
act
as
leaders
of
the
school.
Coupled
with
the
expectations
of
my
teachers
and
school
were
the
high
demands
I
put
on
myself.
I
wanted
to
succeed
at
every
subject,
and
anything
below
my
best
was
unacceptable
to
me.
This
extended
to
my
writing,
where
I
learned
a
new
format
for
book
reports.
For
the
book,
Letters
from
Rifka,
I
had
to
write
a
four
to
five
sentence
summary
and
response.
By
this
point,
almost
everything
had
to
be
typed
on
the
computer
and
completed
using
the
appropriate
fonts
and
margins.
The
challenge
in
this
book
report
lay
in
the
pithiness
of
the
summary.
I
was
accustomed
to
writing
page
after
page
about
a
book,
but
here,
I
was
forced
to
constantly
revise
my
writing
until
it
fit
into
one
paragraph.
It
was
a
lengthy
process,
but
ultimately,
key
in
my
evolving
as
a
writer.
The
idea
of
Nless
is
moreO
was
constantly
in
my
mind.
In
grades
six
through
eight,
projects
took
up
many
hours
of
my
time.
Projects
included
creating
a
map
of
colonial
Georgia
and
writing
about
its
history,
writing
a
lab
report
on
the
staleness
of
different
types
of
cookies,
and
creating
a
script
for
a
puppet
show.
The
wide
array
of
projects
in
different
subjects
gave
me
a
great
background
on
different
topics
and
issues,
but
largely,
for
each
subject,
my
writing
remained
the
same.
My
parents
would
proofread
most
of
my
work,
giving
me
suggestions
and
correcting
my
grammar.
While
I
appreciated
their
feedback,
I
was
often
frustrated
when
I
had
to
fix
entire
paragraphs
after
all
my
hard
work.
Yet,
the
revisions
and
attention
to
detail
consistently
paid
off;
on
my
sixth
grade
report
on
Voyagers
1
and
2,
my
science
teacher
commented
NIncredible
WorkO
and
my
folder
of
work
on
Johnny
Tremain
garnered
high
praises
from
my
literature
teacher.
Throughout
eighth
grade,
my
teachers
would
stress
the
importance
of
being
prepared
for
the
rigors
of
high
school
and
the
increased
amount
of
writing.
Thus,
entering
my
freshman
year,
I
was
apprehensive
about
how
my
writing
ability
would
be
viewed
at
a
higher
level.
I
will
never
forget
one
of
my
first
writing
assignments
in
high
school;
it
was
for
my
World
History
Honors
class.
It
changed
my
thoughts
about
my
writing
ability.
The
assignment
was
to
write
a
five
hundred
word
essay
on
an
emperor
explaining
his
significant
contributions
to
society
and
why
he
was
important.
I
wrote
about
Emperor
Hadrian;
I
detailed
his
reign,
accomplishments,
and
state
of
the
empire
under
his
rule.
Yet,
when
I
received
my
essay
back,
it
was
littered
with
comments
on
every
paragraph,
such
as
Ntoo
many
facts,O
Nexplain
more,O
and
Nlacking
a
thesis.O
Seeing
a
grade
lower
than
that
of
my
middle
school
grades
scared
me.
I
approached
my
teacher
who
gave
me
an
example
of
another
studentOs
paper
who
had
done
outstanding
work.
I
read
and
re-read
her
paper
painstakingly
and
was
dumbfounded
at
what
I
read;
not
only
was
the
essay
shorter
than
the
requested
length,
but
facts
were
few
and
far
between.
Most
of
her
paper
was
her
opinion
on
why
the
emperor
she
had
chosen
was
a
great
leader.
After
reading
my
classmateOs
paper
and
becoming
discouraged
at
my
own
writing
ability,
I
made
it
my
quest
to
adapt
my
writing
style
to
the
way
my
history
teacher
deemed
necessary.
It
was
one
of
the
most
challenging
classes
I
have
ever
written
for,
and
I
carefully
crafted
each
and
every
sentence.
Throughout
the
year,
my
papers
were
sprinkled
with
Nexplain
furtherO
and
Nwhy
is
this
important?,O
but
with
every
comment
he
made,
I
saw
it
as
an
instance
to
improve
my
writing.
I
learned
to
write
a
strong
thesis
statement,
support
it
with
facts
and
convincing
explanations,
and
give
my
own
opinion
on
certain
trends
in
history.
Anxious
to
continue
learning
more
and
more
about
the
past,
I
enrolled
in
Advanced
Placement
U.S.
History
my
sophomore
year
of
history.
My
World
History
teacher
was
also
the
teacher
for
this
class,
and
thus,
I
begrudgingly
looked
forward
to
another
year
of
challenging
writing
assignments.
Not
only
did
my
teacher
increase
the
amount
and
frequency
of
writing
assignments,
but
he
assigned
many
projects
that
included
group
work.
One
project
for
instance,
was
to
create
a
video
documenting
a
NYear
in
Review.O
Three
of
my
fellow
classmates
and
I
had
to
write
a
detailed
script
that
included
a
commercial,
interview,
and
a
newscast.
This
was
the
first
time
that
I
learned
to
proof-read
others
work
and
discuss
my
classmates
writing
with
them.
At
the
same
time,
I
was
able
to
approach
my
own
writing
with
a
more
open
mind
and
ideas.
In
having
others
look
at
my
work,
I
was
able
to
get
feedback
different
from
my
teacher,
which
was
interesting
and
helpful.
My
final
writing
assignment
for
my
history
teacher
of
two
years
was
a
research
paper
on
any
topic
from
colonial
times
of
America
to
its
Civil
War.
I
chose
to
write
about
NThomas
Jefferson
and
Alexander
Hamilton:
Their
Differing
Views
Concerning
the
Power
of
the
Federal
Government.O
This
was
my
first
true
experience
in
writing
a
research
paper,
as
well
as
most
of
my
classmates,
and
my
teacher
made
sure
that
we
took
the
entire
process
in
steps.
From
choosing
a
topic
to
writing
an
outline
to
infusing
our
papers
with
helpful
quotes,
I
learned
how
to
express
my
own
ideas
with
support
from
secondary
and
primary
sources.
Handed
my
paper
following
the
final
exam,
I
saw
on
the
final
page
a
ninety-eight
percent
with
high
complements.
After
two
years
of
hard
work,
seeing
NWritten
very
well!
Very
nice
piece
of
academic
research.
Shows
the
hard
work
you
put
into
it!O
on
my
paper
and
knowing
that
I
had
grown
significantly
as
a
writer
was
a
very
rewarding
feeling.
During
my
senior
year
of
high
school,
the
amount
of
writing
I
did
for
many
of
my
classes
intensified.
Invited
into
the
Aquinas
Program,
and
then
subsequently
taking
its
seminar
class,
I
read
several
books
a
month,
participated
in
group
discussions,
and
wrote
essays
examining
aspects
of
the
books
I
had
read
as
well
as
current
events.
The
Aquinas
Seminar
was
key
in
my
development
as
a
writer
because
it
allowed
me
to
become
a
well-rounded
writer.
One
day
I
would
be
writing
about
African
tribal
traditions,
and
another
day
I
would
be
discussing
the
effects
of
OPECOs
decision
on
the
global
economy.
In
addition
to
the
Aquinas
Seminar,
my
Advanced
Placement
English
class
offered
me
another
opportunity
to
improve
my
writing
skills
and
expand
my
knowledge
of
literature.
My
teacher
asked
us
to
analyze
and
relay
my
thoughts
on
characters,
themes,
and
writing
styles.
He
said
that
my
first
paper
on
the
book,
Stones
from
the
River,
needed
to
be
expanded
upon.
At
the
time,
I
was
frustrated
and
worried
about
what
lay
ahead
for
the
year.
Yet,
as
the
year
progressed
and
I
learned
how
to
explain
quotes
in
detail
and
draw
my
own
conclusions
from
the
novels,
I
realized
just
how
far
I
had
come
as
a
writer
from
that
first
paper.
My
last
paper,
analyzing
the
character
of
Peabody
in
As
I
Lay
Dying,
was
met
with
praise
from
my
teacher
and
admiration
for
a
yearOs
worth
of
hard
work.
After
visiting
and
applying
to
several
colleges
during
my
senior
year,
I
decided
Lafayette
College
was
the
best
fit
for
me.
I
knew
I
would
receive
a
quality
undergraduate
business
degree
and
at
the
same
time
benefit
from
a
strong
liberal
arts
education.
Realizing
that
LafayetteOs
core
requirements
called
for
several
intensive
writing
courses
as
well
as
science
courses,
I
was
nervous
about
how
prepared
I
was.
I
knew
that
I
had
improved
as
a
writer;
I
was
able
to
write
cohesive,
strong
papers.
Yet,
I
knew
that
college
was
going
to
require
long
writing
assignments.
This
was
something
that
occurred
only
once
or
twice
a
year
in
high
school.
Composing
ten
to
fifteen
page
papers
along
with
completing
other
work
seemed
like
a
daunting
task.
After
missing
my
first
semester
due
to
an
illness,
I
was
even
more
worried
when
I
entered
Lafayette
having
not
taken
a
Freshman
Seminar.
I
thought
that
I
would
lack
certain
college-level
research
and
writing
skills
that
my
peers
had
learned.
Upon
writing
for
my
religion
and
sociology
courses,
though,
I
realized
that
my
hard
work
and
continual
revisions,
which
I
continued
to
stick
with
me,
were
crucial.
On
my
first
major
college
paper,
NThe
Social
Construction
of
Identity:
Gender
and
Race,O
I
received
an
Nexcellent
workO
and
my
professor
appreciated
the
connections
I
made
between
assigned
readings
and
my
own
interpretations
of
them.
My
religious
studies
professor
was
a
NtoughO
grader,
and
at
times,
I
was
frustrated
at
having
no
explanation
for
the
grade
I
was
given.
Yet,
I
discovered
that
raising
my
own
questions
and
providing
novel
answers
for
books
and
passages
were
key
to
succeeding
in
the
class.
The
journal
entries
due
weekly
allowed
me
to
do
just
that.
My
professor
commented
NgoodO
when
I
put
forth
an
honest
belief
of
mine
that
I
had
questioned
whether
or
not
to
put
forth
in
writing.
Entering
my
second
year
of
college,
I
was
confident
in
my
writing
abilities,
and
ready
to
approach
English
110:
College
Writing.
The
course
proved
to
be
the
most
rewarding
writing
class
that
I
have
ever
taken,
and
brought
me
to
an
entirely
new
level
of
writing.
Through
countless
peer
reviews,
many
revisions,
and
constant
professor
feedback,
I
approached
my
papers
with
finely
honed
skills
and
a
keen
awareness
of
minute
mistakes.
Also,
my
College
Writing
class
surrounded
me
with
other
strong
writers
and
a
brilliant
professor;
all
engaged
in
helping
me
become
a
better
writer.
Approaching
my
third
year
of
college,
my
confidence
in
my
writing
ability
has
reached
new
heights.
Lafayette
has
helped
me
to
progress
not
only
as
a
student
but
also
as
a
writer
for
several
different
disciplines.
My
writing
always
stands
to
improve,
yet
at
this
point,
I
feel
that
I
can
use
my
skills
and
knowledge
to
help
others
with
their
writing.
