The
Creation
of
a
Writer
Prof.
Patricia
Donahue
August
22,
1996
At
the
tender
age
of
five,
my
mother
enrolled
me
in
an
elementary
school,
and
the
texture
of
my
life
as
a
writer
cultivated
from
this
point
on.
In
the
beginning
of
my
literary
pursuit,
I
was
eager
and
viewed
myself
as
a
scholarly
writer,
until
I
adopted
a
lack
of
confidence
which
altered
my
perception.
But,
I
would
eventually
rediscover
a
passion
for
writing.
I
needed
to
be
instilled
with
confidence
and
take
my
writing
more
under
my
control.
When
I
entered
third
grade,
I
was
introduced
to
a
teacher
who
continuously
impacted
my
life
as
a
writer.
She
endeavored
to
teach
us
the
processes
of
drafting
and
revision.
In
addition
to
this,
students
were
assigned
numerous
novels
which
were
accompanied
by
a
series
of
questions
pertaining
to
interpretation
of
the
texts.
These
questions
were
useful
for
developing
analytical
thinking
and
writing.
Along
with
these
skills
and
the
teacher's
constant
encouragement,
I
gained
a
positive
outlook
on
writing
and
continued
to
pursue
it
throughout
my
elementary
years.
In
Junior
High
School,
I
dabbled
in
investigative
writing
as
a
member
of
the
school
newspaper
staff.
I
wrote
articles
about
interviews
and
current
events.
These
articles
helped
shape
my
short
and
concise
style
of
writing.
Some
articles
were
used
while
others
were
discarded.
Yet,
I
never
felt
discouraged
because
I
received
support
from
the
newspaper
advisor
and
my
peers.
As
a
result
of
my
hardwork,
I
won
the
honor
of
becoming
editor.
In
my
new
position,
I
was
expected
to
perform
on
a
level
I
had
never
been
confronted
with
before.
Not
only
did
I
have
to
worry
about
my
own
writing,
but
I
was
responsible
for
checking
the
other
students'
articles.
I
had
to
make
sure
that
the
articles
were
accurate,
clear,
coherent,
and
not
ambiguous.
Upon
entering
high
school,
I
continued
my
interest
in
writing
through
my
editorial
membership
to
the
literary
magazine.
So
far,
my
life
as
a
writer
had
been
productive
and
positive
until
I
was
situated
with
a
difficult
teacher
in
a
class
I
was
not
prepared
to
handle.
My
worst
experience
as
a
writer
occurred
in
my
third
year
at
my
High
School.
I
had
been
placed
in
a
High
Honors
English
course
which
was
taught
by
a
strict
nun,
Sr.
Joanne.
I
was
honored
that
I
was
able
to
join
her
class
and
felt
that
it
would
be
beneficial
to
me.
However,
the
class
had
opposing
results
on
my
life
as
a
writer.
Effectively,
I
was
instructed
on
the
technicalities
of
writing
and
was
given
a
red
folder
containing
these
explicit
rules.
At
the
time,
I
did
not
realize
that
this
folder
would
prove
to
be
a
useful
implement
in
my
college
years.
Negatively
speaking,
the
teacher
was
very
critical
of
my
work.
At
the
time,
the
criticism
was
too
severe
for
a
young,
insecure
writer
who
was
already
struggling
with
expressing
and
controlling
ideas
on
paper.
After
she
returned
my
papers,
I
could
not
recognize
them.
No
longer
did
they
resemble
a
black
and
white
typed
paper,
but
rather
the
red
sea.
I
felt
frightened
and
discouraged.
Frequently,
I
received
comments
on
the
lack
of
continuity
between
paragraphs.
After
constant
drafting
and
revision,
I
improved
the
problem
but
not
my
faith
in
my
writing.
I
realized
that
my
teacher
did
push
me
to
strive,
yet
at
the
same
time,
I
felt
no
confidence
in
my
writing
as
I
left
to
enter
another
level
of
academia.
Upon
entering
college,
I
was
frightened
by
the
challenge
of
college
writing.
My
only
security
blanket
was
my
trustworthy
red
folder
of
literary
formalities.
Other
than
that,
I
would
never
have
guessed
that
I
would
eventually
choose
to
become
an
English
major.
After
receiving
negative
feedback
from
Sr.
Joanne,
I
was
unsure
of
my
writing
skills.
Nevertheless,
I
figured
that
I
would
learn
to
write
well
in
college.
I
was
determined
to
end
my
disorientation
and
learn
to
write
with
selectivity
in
order
to
produce
a
more
effective
argument.
Thus,
I
believe
my
greatest
improvement
occurred
during
my
college
years.
At
Lafayette,
I
was
rewarded
with
encouragement,
support,
and
guidance
which
has
allowed
me
to
improve
my
performance
as
a
writer.
One
particular
course
launched
my
development
into
the
realm
of
confidant
writing.
After
several
minutes
of
listening
to
my
professor's
proclamation
on
the
struggles
and
victories
of
writing,
I
was
inspired
to
write
like
I
had
never
written
before.
He
stressed
the
importance
of
the
craftsmanship
of
writing,
not
only
the
act
but
the
feeling
behind
each
word.
It
became
easier
to
put
my
ideas
into
words
in
a
manner
which
was
clear
and
coherent.
My
paragraphs
began
to
naturally
form
logical
sequencing.
He
had
instilled
in
me
a
continuous,
pulsating
drive
to
create
and
revise.
I
also
began
to
enjoy
writing
excessively,
especially
the
endless
possibilities
of
playing
with
language.
His
confidence
in
my
writing
enabled
me
to
produce
some
of
my
best
work.
After
viewing
my
writing
from
this
course,
I
was
granted
the
opportunity
to
serve
as
a
Writing
Associate
for
the
Biology
Department.
This
reflected
another's
trust
in
my
competence.
Other
students
were
told
to
rely
on
me
to
direct
them
in
their
writing.
But,
I
was
faced
with
the
internal
problem
of
whether
I
had
faith
in
my
writing.
At
last,
I
knew
that
I
finally
did,
and
I
accepted
the
endeavor.
The
students
were
dependant
on
me,
and
I
was
responsible
for
disciplining
them
and
giving
their
writing
continuity.
This
placed
a
newfound
burden
on
me,
but
I
know
that
it
necessitates
making
a
connection
between
my
ideas
and
that
of
the
other
I
am
aiding
or
expressing
with.
I
realized
how
the
criticism
in
high
school
had
affected
me.
This
understanding
helped
me
to
determine
the
appropriate
degree
of
criticism
and
the
necessary
support
that
should
be
given
to
the
students.
After
this
challenge,
the
following
semester
I
confronted
an
overwhelming
writing
project.
In
my
Vast
course,
I
had
to
write
a
twenty
page
paper
which
would
incorporate
several
texts
that
I
had
read,
as
well
as
related
movies
that
I
had
viewed.
The
paper
would
discuss
violence
in
the
media
and
the
effects
it
has
had
on
the
society.
The
grade
I
received
on
it
would
count
as
my
final
grade.
I
was
faced
with
many
challenges,
besides
the
pressure
of
getting
a
good
grade.
First,
it
was
difficult
to
formulate
a
thesis
which
would
equally
relate
to
the
material
I
was
going
to
use.
Then,
this
information
had
to
be
organized
into
coherent
paragraphs
(which
hopefully
would
be
interesting).
Finally,
I
had
to
edit
and
rework
sections
of
the
paper
to
improve
the
value
of
it.
I
utilized
a
checklist
in
order
to
prevent
the
same
errors
from
occurring
and
to
monitor
my
improvement.
After
many
tedious
hours
and
headaches,
I
had
finally
completed
my
paper.
I
knew
that
the
next
time
I
was
faced
with
such
a
task
it
would
be
much
easier.
I
would
also
be
less
overwhelmed
by
the
length
of
the
assignment.
Since
the
paper
had
to
relate
a
vast
amount
of
information,
the
most
important
strategy
involved
successfully
organizing
the
material.
In
contrast
to
the
tension
and
necessary
organization
of
my
Vast
paper,
my
next
writing
endeavor
was
extremely
relaxing.
While
studying
abroad,
I
kept
a
personal
journal.
I
wanted
to
contain
the
adventures
beyond
my
unreliable
memory.
Since
this
writing
was
extremely
informal
and
always
involved
events
which
I
experienced
firsthand,
I
wrote
in
a
stream
of
consciousness.
It
was
an
enjoyable
experience
which
helped
my
creative
writing
skills
and
ability
to
express
thoughts.
In
every
form
of
writing
I
have
created,
I
must
control
my
ideas
because
I
find
that
as
I
am
writing
a
paper,
I
discover
new
insights
as
I
delve
deeper
into
the
topic.
Even
if
these
discoveries
interest
me,
I
must
be
selective
and
choose
only
that
which
strengthens
the
argument.
Thus,
I
conclude
with
the
understanding
that
writing
a
paper
involves
confidence,
control,
and
especially
revision.
Revision
is
never
complete.
