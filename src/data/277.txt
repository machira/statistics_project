Returning
WA
Nuclear
Power
and
Dynamic
Culture:
My
College
Writing
Experience
over
the
Last
Year
I
felt
like
a
mother
looking
over
her
quarreling
children
in
a
patient,
yet
apprehensive
manner.
My
first
student
group
WA
appointment
had
taken
off
with
a
rocky
start.
The
group,
consisting
of
five
young
freshmen
males,
had
pieces
of
their
paper
strewn
here
and
there,
one
had
not
yet
finished
his
part,
and
a
conclusion
was
no
where
in
sight.
As
they
blamed
one
another,
I
drew
in
a
deep
breath
and
with
a
surge
of
confidence
tried
to
calm
their
tithe
of
nervous
frustration.
Supposedly
the
group
paper
was
due
the
following
morning,
and
they
sat
there
looking
at
me
as
if
I
had
the
golden
touch
that
would
magically
take
their
random
pieces
of
information
concerning
nuclear
power
generators
and
turn
them
into
an
astounding
example
of
literary
prose.
All
in
all,
the
outcome
of
this
unnerving
conference
was
both
a
positive
and
constructive
experience
for
the
students
and
for
myself
as
a
new
writing
associate.
We
discussed
each
individual
piece
and
together
worked
on
finding
solid
transitions
that
would
ultimately
give
the
paper
some
sort
of
literary
flow.
I
even
managed
to
stop
them
from
picking
on
each
other--for
a
short
time.
Over
the
past
year,
my
encountering
as
a
WA
has
been
a
substantial
part
of
my
recent
history
as
a
writer.
While
most
of
my
classes
this
past
year
were
focused
on
a
more
applied
mathematics
or
business
concentration,
I
was
still
able
to
cultivate
my
literary
experience
through
the
college
writing
program,
our
required
Vast
course,
and
my
own
personal
quest
of
literary
improvement.
I
returned
for
my
sophomore
year
last
September
and
with
a
pinch
of
trepidation,
awaited
my
first
WA
conferences.
Later
in
the
semester
I
would
be
blessed
with
papers
describing
coalmines
and
nuclear
power
plants,
but
for
the
first
assignment
of
the
FYS
course
Technology
and
Energy,
there
was
no
discussion
of
nuclear
crisis
or
fossil
fuels.
The
students
were
to
write
a
short
essay
on
their
first
impressions
of
Lafayette
College
after
just
a
week
and
a
half
out
of
their
parents'
grasps
and
thrown
into
this
world
that
would
inevitably
change
them.
At
the
current
point
in
my
college
life,
I
could
not
recall
exactly
what
crazy
thoughts
were
flying
through
my
head
just
a
week
into
freshman
year,
but
I
did
know
that
I
could
relate
to
what
the
students
had
to
say.
When
I
came
to
Lafayette
the
previous
fall,
I
was
certainly
not
the
same
person
both
in
mindset
or
literary
style.
These
conferences
would
also
be
my
first
meetings
with
the
students
one-on-one,
and
I
was
grateful
that
I
would
be
able
to
learn
about
the
student
more
honestly
from
this
personal
literary
exhibition.
Some
of
the
responses
were
hysterically
funny;
some
were
already
bitter
accounts
of
the
fine
institution.
A
few
exhibited
a
standard,
generic
excitement
about
college,
and
others
focused
completely
on
the
dorm
room
party
that
took
place
the
evening
before.
As
I
met
with
each
student
privately
over
the
next
few
days,
I
kept
thinking
about
their
impressions
while
I
studied
their
own
characteristics
in
person
and
on
paper.
As
far
as
the
conferences
went,
some
students
were
genuinely
interested
in
what
advice
I
had
to
give.
Some
were
genuinely
apathetic
to
the
whole
idea.
What
could
I
do?
I
was
only
there
to
help,
not
entertain,
and
whether
or
not
I
had
any
affect
on
their
writing
style
and
organization
was
ultimately
going
to
be
up
to
the
students
themselves.
The
fall
semester
passed
with
my
patience
and
my
people
skills
improving.
Most
of
the
students
were
cooperative,
and
those
group
papers,
due
right
before
finals
week,
proved
to
be
a
challenge.
Though
a
hectic
schedule
prevented
me
from
writing
associate
duties
in
the
spring
semester,
my
experience
was
thorough.
Unfortunately
I
now
know
more
about
the
coal
mines
and
natural
gas
production
than
I
ever
wanted
to
know.
Looking
back,
I
realize
how
important
a
WA's
relationship
with
the
professor
is.
The
professor
and
I
had
a
good
start
of
communication
and
discussion
about
the
individual
students'
writing
abilities.
However,
I
was
to
learn
that
this
man
was
one
of
the
busiest
in
the
engineering
department,
and
as
the
semester
endured,
he
admittedly
placed
his
meager
FYS
course
on
the
back
burner.
I
thought
about
the
students
and
how
in
this
case,
it
was
them
who
would
suffer
when
they
got
to
their
college
writing
course
after
skim
instruction
in
their
FYS,
which
was
focused
anyway
on
a
more
technical
approach
to
writing.
I
believe
I
worked
well
with
the
students,
and
they
felt
free
to
discuss
the
course,
the
instructor,
and
any
setbacks
they
were
having
with
me.
One
of
my
favorite,
more
challenging
aspects
of
the
position
was
working
with
the
international
students
in
the
class.
I
worked
with
students
from
China,
Korea,
and
Turkey,
and
I
was
truly
amazed
at
their
level
of
English
writing
proficiency,
considering
that
some
had
not
been
in
the
country
more
than
a
few
weeks.
These
students
were
eager
to
receive
suggestion,
and
they
were
very
honest
concerning
their
literary
strengths
and
weaknesses.
In
addition,
I
really
felt
the
pressure
of
the
position
when
friends
of
mine
asked
me
to
read
through
their
own
papers
for
other
classes
and
help
them
improve.
Again,
I
now
realized
that
some
people's
view
of
their
WA
is
that
they
have
the
'golden
touch'
that
will
ultimately
guarantee
an
'A'
paper.
Of
course
this
expectation
is
a
fallacy,
and
I
hope
this
year
that
more
students
will
realize
that
it
takes
much
effort
on
both
sides
of
the
conference
to
substantially
improve
a
literary
piece.
I
mentioned
already
that
most
of
my
coursework
required
less
prose
writing
and
were
more
business
or
math
oriented.
However,
this
is
not
to
say
that
I
was
in
anyway
devoid
of
literary
exposure
throughout
the
year.
Though
I
took
a
break
from
the
college
writing
program
in
the
spring,
I
was
honored
to
get
involved
with
the
Lafayette
Technology
Clinic
and
began
working
with
other
students,
professors,
and
clients
in
beginning
to
design
a
website
with
full
information
on
the
surrounding
National
Park
area.
This
course
required
a
lot
of
research,
group
discussion
and
cooperation,
and
a
style
of
writing
important
in
communicating
with
employers
and
people
in
the
community
concerning
what
exactly
our
plans
were
and
how
we
were
going
to
plan
the
project.
I
had
to
develop
a
more
straightforward,
professional
writing
style,
and
I
grew
more
as
a
writer
when
working
with
the
others
in
the
group
to
compromise
on
what
should
be
stated
in
our
reports,
brochures,
posters,
and
web
project.
What
we
wrote
also
had
to
be
exciting
and
inviting
to
families
and
schools
while
encouraging
them
as
potential
visitors
to
the
area.
Our
goal
overall
is
to
sell
a
product
of
interest
to
the
community.
Ironically,
our
research
was
based
on
the
history
of
the
industrial
revolution
and
the
progress
of
energy
in
the
area,
so
the
knowledge
I
gained
reading
numerous
papers
on
coal
mines
previously
as
a
WA
was
valuable
in
my
understanding
of
and
contribution
to
the
project.
As
the
end
of
my
sophomore
year
approached,
I
thought
about
my
choice
to
return
to
the
college
writing
program
and
about
my
own
personal
literary
development
over
the
past
year.
My
VAST
course
was
the
first
writing-oriented
class
I
had
taken
since
FYS.
My
professor,
while
intriguing
our
senses
and
opening
our
eyes
a
bit
wider
to
the
world,
offered
us
a
great
deal
of
freedom
in
our
major
writing
assignments.
When
it
came
time
to
write
papers
for
the
class,
I
found
myself
thinking
like
a
WA
and
being
more
sensitive,
organized,
and
thorough
in
my
own
writing.
I
was
making
sure
I
was
addressing
any
problematic
or
confusing
issues
in
my
writing
that
I
would
suggest
other
students
to
be
wary
of.
Certainly,
I
had
more
respect
for
the
job
of
the
class's
WA.
Compared
to
the
WA
conferences
I
had
during
my
FYS
class,
now
I
was
having
more
discourse
with
the
WA
and
instead
of
just
letting
her
talk
at
me,
I
asked
more
questions,
threw
around
ideas,
valued
her
opinions,
and
gave
more
thought
to
the
entire
experience.
For
our
final
paper
I
was
able
to
choose
a
topic
concerning
any
area
of
reproductive
technology,
and
I
was
motivated
to
cover
the
major
moral
issues
concerning
abortion.
The
paper
did
not
offer
arguments
for
each
side
of
the
controversial
issue,
but
rather
it
was
more
of
a
sociological
study
and
conclusion
of
American
culture,
and
the
people's
moral
obsession
with
this
very
personal
issue.
After
writing
this
paper,
I
became
immediately
interested
in
exploring
certain
social
trends
both
globally
and
domestically,
and
in
understanding
more
about
what
lied
at
the
core
of
our
culture's
development.
The
latter
topic
can
be
observed
through
a
study
of
literature
and
the
greatest
authors
throughout
the
centuries
who
have
ultimately
documented
the
course
of
one's
own
culture's
history.
There
were
always
those
books
in
high
school
that
we
were
not
necessarily
assigned,
but
we
were
encouraged
to
read
on
our
own.
Despite
the
fact
that
one
of
my
favorite
pastimes
is
curling
up
with
a
good
book,
I
realized
that
there
were
still
so
many
books
and
so
many
authors
that
I
had
meant
to
explore
but
never
took
the
time.
Along
with
the
other
tasks
this
summer
has
held,
my
personal
vendetta
was
simply
to
read
more.
I
have
stuck
to
my
word,
and
have
engrossed
myself
in
diversified
writing
styles,
varied
literary
expression,
and
in
listening
to
the
author's
own
voice
and
emotion.
This
year,
as
long
as
schedules
do
not
change,
I
will
be
a
WA
for
a
FYS
focusing
more
on
Chinese
culture,
religion,
and
literature,
and
hopefully
taught
by
a
professor
who
thinks
his/her
FYS
is
worth
devoting
time
to.
I
look
forward
to
gain
more
as
a
writer
working
with
a
different
and
more
engaging
writing
style
as
opposed
to
the
technical
approach
I
worked
with
last
year,
as
well
as
diversifying
my
literary
background
with
Chinese
custom.
Working
with
freshmen
students
again
is
especially
interesting
since
their
FYS
is
their
first,
sometimes
painful,
exposure
to
the
demands
of
college
level
writing.
It
can
also
be
an
shot
to
the
ego
for
some
students
who
are
coming
out
of
high
school
believing
that
they
know
exactly
what
their
doing
and
are
sure
they
are
producing
straight
'A'
papers.
This
can
be
frustrating
for
many
students.
I
suggest
to
new
writing
associates
and
remind
myself
to
be
prepared
to
patiently
guide
and
assist
students
through
conferences
with
positive,
but
not
forced,
criticisms
and
clear
explanations
of
how
they
can
better
organize
their
thoughts,
illustrate
their
ideas,
and
most
importantly
write
about
what
the
professor
is
expecting.
Also,
one
can
not
forget
to
keep
a
good
relationship
with
the
professor
and
openly
discuss
the
expectations
and
schemes
for
each
assignment.
I
have
also
found
the
instructor
to
be
helpful
in
discussing
the
student's
individual
abilities
and
what
to
expect
or
advise
when
working
with
the
student.
Every
year
and
every
experience
brings
personal
advancement
to
any
writer,
and
by
combining
my
work
with
the
college
writing
program,
the
technology
clinic,
and
my
engagement
in
more
writing-oriented
classes,
I
expect
this
year
to
be
an
significant
one
in
my
maturity
as
a
writer.
