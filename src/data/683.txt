My
first
experiences
with
words
happened
at
an
age
which
in
my
memory
is
an
amalgam
of
ages
three
to
five.
My
parents
always
read
to
me
and
told
me
stories,
and
I
always
wanted
the
book
to
be
in
view,
even
if
letters
were
still
foreign
symbols
to
me.
I
also
liked
to
dictate
stories
to
my
mother,
who
would
dutifully
write
them
down,
even
if
they
made
little
sense,
leaving
me
room
to
add
my
own
illustrations.
When
I
was
ever
so
slightly
older
--
and
this
is
what
I
remember
best
--
I
had
a
fantasy
about
how
I
would
begin
to
read.
I
would
simply
come
home
one
day,
drop
my
backpack,
and
pick
up
a
book,
instantly
understanding
what
it
said
as
a
result
of
one
dayOs
schoolwork.
My
young
mind
couldnOt
yet
comprehend
the
learning
process;
I
hadnOt
the
capability
of
imagining
what
that
might
look
like.
Still
to
this
day,
however,
I
have
a
gap
in
my
memory
between
this
childish
fantasy
and
actually
beginning
to
read.
I
had
no
struggles;
it
always
came
naturally
to
me,
as
did
writing,
and
I
had
an
obnoxious
but
innocent
confusion
as
to
why
my
classmates
did
not
realize
how
simple
these
things
were.
I
was
not
and
still
am
not
a
remarkably
patient
person.
It
seemed
to
me
that
they
were
just
being
stubborn.
That
was
first
grade
-
thatOs
when
Putnam
Valley
schools
began
to
teach
its
children
to
read
and
write.
The
alphabet
was
kindergarden.
By
the
time
I
was
in
second
grade
I
had
already
begun
to
read
everything
that
I
could
get
my
hands
on,
and
at
all
times.
We
had
a
Nreading
logO
in
which
we
were
supposed
to
write
down
the
title
and
author
of
each
book
that
we
read,
and
which
was
collected
monthly
to
make
sure
we
were
reading.
I
never
filled
out
a
single
title,
because
I
went
through
books
too
fast
that
I
(again,
not
being
the
most
patient
of
children)
couldnOt
be
bothered
with
filling
out
all
of
those
names
when
I
could
already
be
on
to
the
next
book.
And
my
reading
log
was
never
collected.
We
also
had
a
reading
period
-
it
must
have
been
fifteen
minutes
long
-
where
we
got
to
distribute
ourselves
around
the
room
and
choose
any
book
we
wanted
and
read
to
ourselves.
It
was
my
favorite
time
of
the
day.
Following
that
the
teacher
read
to
us
aloud,
but
I
still
remember
looking
up
from
silent
reading
one
day
and
realizing
that
the
entire
class
had
picked
themselves
up,
put
their
books
away,
and
were
sitting
quietly
in
front
of
the
teacher
for
read
aloud
--
she
must
have
been
at
least
five
minutes
in
already
--
and
I
hadnOt
noticed
any
of
it.
I
thought
for
sure
I
must
be
in
trouble,
but
I
wasnOt.
This
has
always
been
my
state
when
reading
or
writing
-
total
immersion.
I
think
that
if
you
talk
to
other
people
whose
entire
lives
consist
of
books
and
fantasies
and
worn
down
pencils,
you
would
find
the
same
thing.
In
the
following
years
of
elementary
school,
I
did
begin
to
get
in
trouble
for
my
avid
reading
-
with
the
book
propped
underneath
or
inside
the
desk
during
class,
at
recess,
sitting
under
a
clothing
rack
while
shopping
with
my
mother,
anywhere.
When
you
love
words,
you
make
sure
youOre
never
without
them.
They
can
be
a
comfort,
a
protection,
a
weapon.
Harry
Potter
came
out
when
I
was
in
third
grade.
My
mom
read
the
review
in
the
Times
and
told
me
that
it
said
that
this
was
a
book
that
moms
started
to
read
to
their
children
and
finished
themselves
the
same
night.
I
was
reluctant
to
take
my
motherOs
advice;
I
do
not
tolerate
other
people
attempting
to
dictate
my
reading
choices.
But
I
let
her
start
it,
and
I
finished
it
that
night.
For
years
I
pretended
to
be
afraid
of
the
dark,
so
that
my
parents
would
let
me
have
a
nightlight
in
my
room.
I
would
then
lean
over
the
side
of
my
bed,
tilt
the
book
so
that
it
caught
the
light,
and
read
that
way
for
hours.
Sometimes
upside
down,
but
I
always
stayed
in
bed
lest
I
should
be
caught.
I
contend
that
I
have
back
problems
to
this
day
as
a
result
of
doing
that
every
night
for
years.
I
give
my
fourth
grade
teacher
credit
for
providing
me
with
the
opportunity
to
realize
that
writing
was
what
I
would
be
doing
with
the
rest
of
my
life.
I
had
always
read
voraciously,
in
fact
it
was
all
I
was
every
really
interested
in
doing
with
my
time,
and
this
teacher
gave
the
most
impassioned
read-aloud
sessions
I
have
ever
been
privy
to.
He
also
required
us
to
write
in
a
journal,
at
least
once
a
week.
He
always
carved
out
a
chunk
of
class
time,
told
us
to
distribute
ourselves
around
the
room
comfortably,
and
write
whatever
we
wanted.
Not
just
things
about
school,
but
whatever
we
felt
like
writing
about.
It
quickly
became
my
favorite
activity.
I
found
that
journal
a
couple
of
years
ago.
My
handwriting
is
atrocious,
as
is
my
spelling,
but
it
made
me
remember
sitting
hunched
up
underneath
a
desk,
or
sprawled
out
on
a
hill
outside
while
on
a
field
trip,
and
feeling
completely
contented
for
the
first
time
--
not
knowing
even
what
that
feeling
was,
but
knowing
that
I
was
perfectly
at
peace.
My
father
taught
in
the
elementary
school
that
I
attended,
but
when
I
moved
on
to
middle
school,
he
moved
on
also,
to
teaching
high
school.
Both
of
my
parents
are
special
education
teachers.
The
middle
and
high
school
in
the
district
I
live
in
are
ten
feet
apart
from
each
other
--
for
a
long
time
Putnam
Valley
didnOt
have
a
high
school.
The
first
graduating
class
was
only
four
years
ahead
of
me.
But
after
much
petitioning
the
district
finally
built
one,
a
beautiful
one.
Unfortunately,
the
same
cannot
be
said
for
Putnam
Valley
Middle
School.
The
building
has
been
described
by
its
students
as
looking
and
feeling
like
a
prison,
or
a
dungeon.
There
is
an
alarming
absence
of
natural
light,
the
classrooms
are
small
and
dingy,
and
the
NlibraryO
is
built
into
the
hallway.
I
donOt
remember
doing
much
writing
in
this
place,
but
I
remember
being
commended
for
whatever
I
did
do.
I
remember
my
English
teachers
coming
up
to
me
and
apologizing
for
the
slow
curriculum.
This
wasnOt
only
about
my
proficiency
for
language
--
Putnam
Valley
Middle
School
did
not
have
the
most
advanced
educational
system.
I
would
drive
in
every
morning
with
my
dad
and
sit
in
his
room
for
the
half
hour
before
school
started,
and
read.
After
school,
I
would
sit
in
the
oversized
chair
at
his
desk,
in
front
of
his
now
antiquated
computer,
and
type
my
papers
or
an
email
to
my
pen
pal.
I
always
had
a
pen
pal
of
some
sort
--
that
was
the
year
also
that
I
wrote
one
letter
every
day
to
my
best
friend
for
a
month,
though
she
only
lived
five
minutes
away
and
was
in
all
of
my
classes.
And
then
when
I
got
bored
with
that
I
started
writing
letters
to
her
best
friend,
who
I
still
write
to
sometimes.
I
think
that
letter-writing
is
beautiful,
and
itOs
a
shame
that
people
donOt
do
it
much
any
more.
My
dad
was
saying
just
the
other
day
that
now,
when
he
goes
to
write
something
down
longhand,
he
can
tell
that
heOs
out
of
practice,
because
everything
gets
typed
nowadays.
And
apparently
they
arenOt
even
teaching
script
in
school
anymore.
I
donOt
use
script,
but
I
do
prefer
to
write
longhand.
When
I
first
began
writing
essays
I
refused
to
type
them
on
the
computer
until
I
had
written
them
out
first.
My
first
real
memories
of
writing
essays
though
are
not
really
until
seventh
grade
--
or,
halfway
through
seventh
grade,
because
thatOs
when
I
got
fed
up
with
the
Putnam
Valley
school
system
and
changed
schools.
My
mother
teaches
in
the
somewhat
nearby
Chappaqua
school
district
--
a
very
commended
district
--
and
when
I
figured
out
that
I
could
get
a
much
better
education
there,
I
switched
immediately.
It
wasnOt
an
easy
decision,
I
had
friends
and
a
life
I
left
behind,
but
I
somehow
could
sense
that
it
was
the
right
thing,
and
it
was.
Even
at
twelve
I
valued
education
above
everything
else.
I
am
now
very
grateful
that
I
had
such
an
incredible
opportunity,
one
that
helped
shape
me
into
who
I
am
now,
but
it
was
harder
to
be
sure
at
that
age.
Chappaqua
was
hard,
really
hard,
and
I
didnOt
get
any
slack
because
I
was
the
new
kid.
Math
and
science
scared
me
--
everyone
had
these
enormous
calculators
that
I
had
never
even
seen
before
(my
first
encounter
with
TI
--
little
could
I
have
known
the
enemies
we
would
become)
--
but
it
was
worth
it,
because
I
was
finally
being
challenged
in
the
way
that
I
had
craved.
I
had
an
essay
assigned
the
first
week
I
was
there.
The
rest
of
the
class
had
been
working
on
it
for
a
while,
but
of
course
I
was
still
expected
to
hand
it
in.
I
donOt
remember
what
the
prompt
was,
but
I
remember
that
my
essay
was
about
the
history
of
chocolate,
and
I
remember
that
when
we
peer-edited
one
of
my
classmates
wrote
as
his
comment
only
Nbig
words.O
IOm
still
not
sure
whether
that
was
a
compliment,
an
insult,
an
expression
of
being
impressed,
or
just
a
really
lazy
insight.
Either
way
I
was
excited
to
confront
all
of
these
unknown
academic
experiences,
and
it
didnOt
take
me
long
to
recreate
my
identity
as
the
girl
with
the
books.
(Incidentally,
last
year
I
was
walking
down
the
hall
back
to
my
dorm
room
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
when
a
girl
walking
the
other
direction
suddenly
pointed
at
me
as
she
passed
and
yelled
Nyou
have
all
the
books!O
referring
to
the
ever-increasing
wall
of
books
that
I
build
in
my
room
at
the
start
of
every
school
year.
As
I
did
not
know
her,
I
did
not
try
to
correct
her
and
tell
her
that
I
certainly
do
not
have
all
the
books).
My
reputation
was
only
more
firmly
cemented
in
high
school.
As
the
school
bus
did
not
come
to
my
house,
I
had
to
take
the
forty-five
minute
drive
every
morning
with
my
mother,
getting
to
school
an
hour
early,
because
as
a
teacher
she
needed
to
be
in
well
before
school
began.
I
woke
up
at
five-thirty
every
morning,
but
when
I
was
not
too
tired
I
filled
that
time
reading.
The
first
couple
of
years
of
high
school
were
torturous.
My
high
school,
Greeley,
strove
to
be
like
a
college
in
every
way,
from
the
classes
to
the
free
time
to
the
very
architecture
of
the
school.
It
was
like
a
hybrid
college/intense
private
school,
even
though
it
was
only
a
public
school
in
a
very
wealthy
area
of
Westchester.
This
was
wonderful
in
many
ways
--
IOve
never
come
across
a
former
Greeley
student
who
has
thought
that
college
was
anything
but
a
piece
of
cake
compared
to
their
high
school
life.
But
one
of
GreeleyOs
major
flaws
(for
me,
at
least,
though
I
may
be
the
only
person
who
has
ever
even
noticed)
is
that
for
freshman
and
sophomore
year,
students
are
not
allowed
to
choose
English
electives
to
fill
their
elective
spaces.
They
have
to
take
one
of
the
many
many
music,
art,
or
acting
classes
offered.
And
they
take
standard
9/10
English.
ItOs
a
good
class,
and
a
number
of
very
worthwhile
books
are
taught,
but
it
is
intended
to
teach
towards
the
English
regents
(New
York
State
test),
and
for
some
of
us,
thatOs
just
not
enough.
During
those
first
few
years,
I
was
given
a
good,
basic
understanding
of
how
generally
to
write
an
acceptable
academic
essay.
I
got
to
explore
a
little
bit
of
creative
writing
or
creative
nonfiction
(my
favorite),
writing
things
like
a
deleted
scene
from
Macbeth
in
iambic
pentameter
during
my
sophomore
year,
or
a
thoroughly
offensive
piece
about
my
family
holidays
during
my
freshman
year
that
somehow
won
some
sort
of
award.
But
the
ratio
of
reading/writing-based
classes
in
my
schedule
to
not-reading/writing-based
classes
was
still
1:6,
which
meant
that
I
was
miserable.
I
wasnOt
even
really
sure
yet
why
I
was
so
miserable,
but
I
did
know
that
I
far
preferred
to
just
work
on
that
essay
about
NThe
Catcher
in
the
RyeO
(which
I
didnOt
even
like)
for
nine
hours
than
memorize
monologues
for
Acting
I
and
verbs
for
French
class.
My
fairly
severe
depression
suddenly
and
easily
lifted
though
at
the
start
of
my
junior
year.
I
could
finally
take
the
classes
that
I
wished
to
take,
and
I
wasnOt
going
to
let
that
opportunity
go
to
waste.
After
a
great
many
lengthy
NdiscussionsO
(read:
arguments)
with
my
guidance
counselor,
I
was
finally
allowed
to
pack
all
of
my
elective
and
free
periods
with
English
classes.
Because
beyond
freshman/sophomore
English,
no
standard
English
class
was
offered
--
they
were
all
electives
(Shakespeare,
Myth,
Modern
World
Literature,
etc.),
and
students
were
intended
to
choose
one
each
semester
to
fulfill
their
requirements.
No
one
before
had
attempted
or
even
requested
to
take
two
at
a
time,
let
alone
five
or
six.
There
were
around
twenty
offerings;
by
the
time
I
graduated,
I
had
taken
about
sixteen.
The
second
semester
of
my
junior
year
I
was
taking
nine
classes
in
an
eight
period
day,
over
half
of
them
being
English.
My
guidance
counselor
intervened
and
told
me
that
the
school
would
no
longer
allow
me
to
take
so
many,
and
I
had
to
drop
one.
I
may
or
may
not
have
tricked
him
into
allowing
me
to
sign
up
for
so
many
in
the
first
place,
but
that
was
the
official
end
of
our
feigned
amicable
relationship.
Guidance
counselors
like
to
follow
school
rules,
and
I
was
only
interested
in
one
thing
--
doing
what
made
me
happy.
I
like
to
think
though
that
I
earned
a
begrudging
sort
of
respect.
Needless
to
say,
the
last
two
years
of
my
high
school
career
were
exhausting.
I
had
no
real
time
for
(or
interest
in)
a
social
life,
but
they
were
probably
the
two
happiest
years
of
my
life.
I
read
and
wrote
nearly
constantly
(at
the
end
of
the
year,
my
eye
doctor
thought
that
something
was
seriously
wrong
because
my
eyesight
had
gotten
so
much
worse
so
fast
as
a
result
of
all
the
strain),
and
really
asserted
myself.
One
of
the
most
rewarding
things
about
academic
writing
--
writing
an
essay
in
which
you
explore
the
opinions
that
you
have
formed
while
reading
a
book
--
is
that
the
intensity
of
the
writing
process
allows
you
to
discover
new
insights
that
you
never
could
have
just
in
discussion
or
inside
your
own
head.
And
once
you
get
into
that
habit
it
becomes
easier
and
easier
to
make
those
revelations.
When
your
brain
is
taxed
like
that,
it
becomes
clear
how
much
of
a
muscle
the
mind
really
is,
how
noticeably
areas
that
are
used
often
become
stronger,
and
how
they
can
weaken
when
they
fall
into
disuse.
My
first
year
of
college,
it
was
as
though
I
could
feel
the
creativity
portion
of
my
brain
withering
away.
There
was
so
much
time
to
get
such
small
amounts
of
work
done,
classes
were
so
few
and
far
between.
Nothing
was
pressing,
which
made
it
all
the
more
difficult
to
sit
down
and
get
anything
done.
All
of
a
sudden,
a
social
life
was
necessary
and
expected.
This
was
the
biggest
writing
challenge
that
I
have
encountered
in
college.
Certainly,
papers
got
longer,
references
(something
I
had
been
relatively
unfamiliar
with)
were
more
expected,
but
in
terms
of
content,
I
have
found
college
to
be
less
demanding.
But
a
writer
is
a
writer,
and
I
enjoy
what
I
do
write,
I
put
effort
into
it,
and
when
I
have
no
papers
(which
was
at
first
a
huge
shock
to
the
system,
seeing
as
how
I
had
previously
had
no
less
than
a
paper
a
night),
I
write
essays
about
my
own
life,
what
I
observe,
what
I
see,
what
I
feel,
a
response
to
an
article
in
the
Times
that
day,
anything
that
moves
me.
IOve
always
found
this
to
be
true.
I
get
restless
if
IOm
not
writing.
ItOs
been
so
much
a
part
of
my
life
for
so
long
that
I
take
it
for
granted
as
an
integral
piece
of
who
I
am,
if
not
the
defining
piece.
