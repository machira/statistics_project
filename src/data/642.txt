WA
Literacy
Narrative
August
17,
2009
My
history
as
a
writer
has
changed
significantly
over
the
past
year,
largely
due
to
my
experiences
as
a
Writing
Associate.
Overall,
my
first
year
as
a
WA
was
rewarding
on
multiple
levels,
and
I
feel
that
working
as
a
WA
has
helped
me
to
improve
not
only
my
ability
to
critically
analyze
a
paper
but
also
my
ability
to
write.
Now,
when
I
work
on
an
academic
paper
or
my
own
creative
writing,
I
find
myself
asking
myself
the
same
types
of
questions
regarding
my
personal
writing
that
I
would
have
asked
were
I
conferencing
with
a
student.
My
first
conference
as
a
WA
was
a
bit
scary.
I
was
as
prepared
as
I
could
have
been,
but
I
still
felt
a
bit
awkward
as
I
met
with
my
first
student.
For
one,
my
first
student
should
have
been
my
third
student,
but
I
had
had
two
Nno-shows,O
which
wasnOt
the
best
way
to
start
off
my
experience
as
a
WA.
And
when
I
began
my
first
conference,
I
found
myself
facing
a
rather
quiet
student
who
felt
that
his
paper
was
NfineO
and
didnOt
have
many
questions
to
ask
me.
But
as
I
held
more
conferences,
my
skills
as
a
WA
improved.
I
learned
the
types
of
questions
to
ask
to
get
my
students
to
talk
about
their
writing
and
to
ask
me
questions.
I
learned
not
only
how
to
conference,
but
how
to
look
through
a
studentOs
paper
and
select
the
most
important
issues
to
address.
These
were
the
Nhigher
order
concernsO
that
we
spoke
of
in
our
staff
meetings,
which
were
also
incredibly
valuable
in
teaching
me
the
necessary
skills
to
be
a
good
WA.
And
as
each
semester
went
on,
I
could
actually
see
the
improvements
in
my
studentsO
writing,
particularly
in
the
freshmen
who
were
just
making
the
transition
from
high
school
writing
to
college
writing.
I
was
particularly
proud
to
see
the
improvements
in
the
two
students
for
whom
English
was
not
their
first
language.
At
first,
I
wasnOt
sure
how
to
approach
such
students.
Did
I
need
to
have
conferences
where
I
did
nothing
more
than
go
over
grammatical
rules?
I
wasnOt
sure
at
first,
but
I
learned
how
to
balance
grammar
with
the
higher
order
concerns,
and
I
think
that
these
students
were
especially
grateful
for
my
help.
Interestingly,
I
gained
a
new
authority
as
a
WA.
The
students
who
worked
with
me
seemed
to
look
to
me
as
a
knowledgeable
source,
someone
who
knew
how
to
write
and
how
to
improve
othersO
writing.
My
friends
too
would
turn
to
me
for
writing
advice.
One
friend
asked
me
once
if
I
could
use
my
Nawesome
WA
powersO
to
look
over
her
paper
for
her.
Such
comments
have
raised
my
confidence
in
my
ability
as
a
writer
and
as
a
peer
editor,
which
has
made
me
wonder
if
I
might
like
to
work
as
an
editor
someday.
Confidence
is
an
important
thing
for
a
writer,
especially
for
someone
like
me
who
enjoys
creative
writing.
With
creative
writing,
it
is
hard
not
to
compare
myself
to
other
writers,
to
look
at
my
own
work
and
think
that
itOs
just
not
good
enough.
Now,
I
have
a
new
confidence
in
my
writing
talents,
and
I
believe
that
this
confidence
has
stemmed
from
my
work
as
a
WA.
In
addition
to
confidence,
my
history
as
a
writer
has
also
changed
over
the
past
year
in
terms
of
my
abilities
to
assess
and
improve
my
own
work.
I
wontO
lie.
Writing
research
papers
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
things
to
do.
In
the
past,
I
would
dedicate
a
Saturday
to
a
paper
and
sit
down
and
finish
that
paper
all
in
one
day.
Then,
once
I
was
finished,
I
was
just
so
glad
to
be
done
that
IOd
do
a
quick
check
for
grammatical
errors
and
call
it
a
wrap.
IOve
always
done
well
on
papers
in
terms
of
grades
with
this
method,
but
IOve
learned
through
my
experience
as
a
WA
that
I
am
not
making
the
most
of
my
works
of
writing
if
I
do
not
take
a
more
thorough
look
at
my
paper
after
I
Nfinish.O
Now,
I
still
like
to
write
a
paper
all
in
one
day,
but
I
make
more
of
an
effort
in
terms
of
editing.
I
am
now
familiar
with
the
idea
of
higher
and
lower
order
concerns
from
my
experience
as
a
WA,
so
now
when
I
look
over
my
own
writing,
I
make
sure
to
address
both
types
of
issues.
I
check
not
only
for
grammar
and
sentence-level
issues,
but
also
for
more
serious
issues
like
organization,
transitions
between
paragraphs,
incorporation
of
quotes
and
concrete
examples
to
support
a
point,
etc.
IOve
learned
to
look
at
my
paper
as
a
draft
that
may
need
major
reorganizing
if
necessary
rather
than
a
mostly
finished
paper
that
just
needs
some
grammatical
polish.
In
staff
meetings,
we
have
emphasized
that
as
WAs,
we
are
interested
in
writing
as
a
process,
but
it
was
not
until
after
I
became
a
WA
that
I
began
to
look
at
my
own
writing
this
way.
Thinking
of
writing
as
a
process,
a
fundamental
element
of
the
College
Writing
Program,
has
affected
my
writing
in
other
ways
as
well.
I
am
now
more
likely
to
do
extensive
brainstorming
and
outlining
before
beginning
a
first
draft
of
a
paper.
Before,
I
would
jot
down
some
notes
and
organize
myself
very
generally
in
my
head,
but
now
I
create
more
concrete
and
detailed
outlines
on
paper
before
writing.
I
do
this
with
my
creative
writing
too,
something
I
never
really
did
before,
and
such
a
method
does
wonders
for
ensuring
that
I
donOt
get
a
case
of
writerOs
block.
I
am
able
to
keep
the
ideas
flowing
more
easily
with
an
outline
in
front
of
me.
As
I
mentioned,
I
am
also
more
likely
to
do
multiple
drafts
if
needed.
Outlining
helps
me
make
sure
IOm
well
organized
beforehand,
but
I
am
now
more
willing
to
make
major
revisions
to
my
first
draft
than
I
have
been
in
the
past
if
I
come
across
other
major
issues.
As
I
write,
I
find
myself
thinking
of
the
type
of
advice
I
would
give
a
student
if
my
paper
was
instead
a
student
paper.
IOve
learned
that
students
have
a
tendency
to
write
a
paper
and
think
itOs
fine,
but
there
is
always
something
more
that
can
be
done
with
that
paper.
That
is
how
I
now
approach
my
writing,
even
when
IOm
happy
with
what
IOve
written.
I
am
now
less
quick
to
think
of
my
writing
as
completely
fine,
because
as
a
student
writer
myself,
chances
are
good
that
my
paper
is
not
perfect,
even
if
it
is
good.
Now,
I
am
always
striving
for
something
better
in
both
my
academic
writing
and
my
creative
writing.
Speaking
of
creative
writing,
recently,
there
has
been
another
change
in
my
history
as
a
writer
that
is
not
directly
related
to
my
WA
experiences
but
has
been
impacted
by
these
improvements
in
my
writing
skills.
IOve
always
enjoyed
creative
writing,
and
IOve
thought
about
the
possibility
of
writing
as
a
career
someday.
So
this
summer,
I
tackled
a
major
project.
I
decided
to
write
a
book.
IOve
always
loved
reading
fantasy
novels,
and
as
this
year
proved
to
be
a
difficult
one
for
attaining
internships,
I
decided
to
spend
my
summer
writing
a
fantasy
novel.
As
I
write
this
literacy
narrative,
I
currently
have
381
pages,
and
I
might
even
be
able
to
finish
the
book
completely
before
the
summerOs
end.
Writing
a
book
has
been
an
incredible
experience.
ItOs
been
more
fun
than
work,
and
I
actually
get
antsy
when
I
decide
to
take
a
day
off
from
writing
because
the
ideas
just
keep
flowing
regardless.
My
dream
would
be
to
see
this
book
in
a
bookstore
someday,
and
I
believe
that
the
skills
IOve
developed
as
a
WA
may
help
me
reach
that
point.
My
WA
skills
have
definitely
had
an
impact
on
this
book
so
far.
To
start
with,
I
approached
the
project
with
the
mindset
that
writing
is
a
process.
I
would
probably
have
been
lost
if
I
had
just
jumped
into
the
writing
without
any
sort
of
outline.
So
to
begin
with,
I
spent
a
couple
days
just
brainstorming
and
jotting
down
notes.
What
I
wound
up
with
was
the
start
of
an
outline.
It
was
not
complete
by
any
means,
nor
was
it
very
organized.
And
so
I
learned
that
not
every
piece
of
writing
can
be
outlined
entirely
beforehand,
especially
in
the
case
of
a
project
of
novel-sized
proportions.
I
began
with
a
handful
of
characters,
a
general
situation,
a
beginning,
and
a
handful
of
scenes
that
I
wanted
to
include
somewhere
in
my
story.
But
as
I
went
along,
more
and
more
ideas
came
to
me.
I
had
to
keep
a
notebook
on
hand
at
all
times
in
case
an
idea
popped
up
on
me,
which
tended
to
happen
just
as
I
was
falling
asleep.
This
made
for
several
sleepless
nights,
nights
when
my
mind
was
just
too
full
of
ideas
to
fall
asleep,
but
it
was
worth
it
in
the
end.
From
these
notes,
my
outline
took
shape,
and
I
was
constantly
adding
details
as
I
went
along.
So
writing,
I
learned,
is
a
balance
between
planning
and
spontaneity.
The
idea
of
writing
as
a
process
will
also
come
into
play
in
the
end,
after
IOm
finished
with
the
first
draft.
As
this
is
a
book,
I
definitely
have
to
look
at
this
as
a
draft,
something
that
will
probably
undergo
some
major
revisions
before
I
can
call
it
a
final
copy.
I
cannot
go
over
grammar
and
call
it
a
day
with
this
book.
This
project
will
only
be
successful
if
I
keep
in
mind
that
writing
is
a
process,
a
process
that
involves
brainstorming,
outlining,
and
multiple
drafts.
I
have
not
yet
reached
the
final
editing
stages,
as
I
have
a
bit
more
plot
to
write
about,
but
I
have
been
doing
some
editing
along
the
way.
At
this
point,
lower
order
concerns
such
as
grammar
and
sentence
structure
have
been
my
priority.
When
I
write,
I
have
a
tendency
to
get
excited
along
with
the
rising
action
in
the
plot.
This
often
results
in
lengthy
sentences
separated
by
lots
of
commas.
I
do
so
enjoy
commas
and
long
strings
of
adjectives.
Thus
this
project
has
also
made
me
realize
some
of
my
weaknesses
as
a
writer,
things
that
I
need
to
keep
in
mind
as
I
go
along.
I
also
pay
attention
to
larger
concerns,
such
as
character
development,
consistent
voice,
maintaining
tension,
placement
of
scenes,
dialogue,
revelation
of
important
information,
etc.
But
most
of
my
major
revisions
will
take
place
at
the
end.
When
I
reach
that
point,
I
know
that
I
will
be
able
to
apply
many
of
the
techniques
IOve
learned
as
a
WA
to
my
creative
writing,
even
though
I
have
not
yet
had
the
chance
to
work
with
a
creative
writing
class
(something
I
would
love
to
do
someday).
At
the
end,
I
know
that
IOll
have
to
step
back
and
look
at
the
higher
order
concerns
like
organization,
structure,
development,
etc.
Some
of
these
things
IOve
only
really
applied
to
academic
writing
before,
but
I
know
that
they
are
just
as
applicable
to
fiction.
I
also
realize
that
I
may
have
to
throw
out
or
completely
re-write
scenes.
The
thought
makes
me
cringe,
but
writing
is
a
process,
and
in
order
to
come
up
with
a
polished
final
draft,
major
re-writing
may
be
necessary.
I
realize
this
now
from
my
experiences
as
a
WA.
My
experiences
not
only
in
critically
analyzing
papers
but
also
in
conferencing
will
also
aid
me
in
this
project.
Through
my
time
as
a
WA,
IOve
learned
how
to
talk
to
people
about
writing,
including
students
and
professors.
This
will
help
me
when
it
comes
time
for
me
to
talk
to
someone
about
my
bookNfirst,
my
creative
writing
professor
and,
if
IOm
lucky,
maybe
even
an
editor.
I
am
naturally
a
quiet
person,
and
WA
conferences
have
greatly
improved
my
communication
skills,
which
are
necessary
for
any
job,
not
just
writing
and
editing-related
occupations.
Overall,
my
experience
as
a
WA
has
been
highly
rewarding.
I
enjoy
a
sense
of
satisfaction
when
I
see
my
students
succeed
and
improve
in
their
skills,
knowing
that
IOve
played
some
role
in
that
success.
I
have
also
experienced
personal
gain
from
my
time
as
a
WA
in
terms
of
an
improvement
in
my
own
writing
skills.
I
have
learned
how
to
communicate
better,
especially
when
discussing
writing.
I
have
also
learned
how
to
analyze
my
own
writing
using
the
same
skills
that
I
would
use
to
analyze
student
papers.
My
writing
methods
have
improved
in
that
I
am
more
willing
to
use
outlines
and
multiple
drafts,
as
well
as
doing
more
in-depth
editing
and
analysis.
These
skills
will
help
me
next
year
as
I
take
multiple
writing
classes
and
as
I
complete
my
book.
And
if
I
do
go
on
to
pursue
a
career
in
publishing
or
as
an
author,
I
know
that
the
skills
I
have
gained
as
a
WA
will
help
me
be
successful.
