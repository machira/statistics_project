Literacy
Narrative
It's
kind
of
ironic,
but
the
first
writing
experience
that
I
remember
has
very
little
to
do
with
the
actual
writing
assignment.
When
I
was
in
third
grade
my
entire
class
entered
a
creative
writing
contest
sponsored
by
our
local
library.
What
I
recollect
most
clearly
is
the
afternoon
when
the
winners
of
the
contest
were
announced.
I
can
still
see
my
classroom,
badly
colored
posters
and
artwork
pasted
over
every
available
inch
of
wall
space
and
the
tiny
little
desks
that
seemed
gigantic
at
the
time.
I
was
perched
upon
my
desk,
gazing
intently
at
the
intercom
speaker
as
though
I
might
be
able
to
see
the
name
of
the
winner
before
it
was
announced.
I
do
not
think
that
I
was
particularly
expecting
to
hear
my
name
called.
In
fact,
I
thought
that
my
story
was
not
very
good
at
all.
It
seemed
an
eternity
until
they
began
to
announce
the
winners
from
the
third
grade.
First
place,
second
place
and
third
place
all
passed
me
by.
Then,
suddenly,
I
heard
my
name.
I
had
received
an
honorable
mention.
Out
of
all
the
third
grade
students
in
our
district,
my
stupid
story
had
won
honorable
mention.
I
tried
to
smile
and
be
happy
as
all
of
the
other
students
and
my
teacher,
Mrs.
Ackerman,
congratulated
me,
but
there
was
something
terrible
bothering
me.
This
particular
writing
assignment
was
the
first
story
I
had
ever
written.
I
had
never
been
asked
to
write
anything
longer
than
my
spelling
list
before
then,
and
I
had
certainly
never
been
asked
to
put
my
imagination
into
words.
Needless
to
say,
I
was
stumped.
Not
only
did
I
have
no
idea
how
to
write
something
like
this,
I
had
no
clue
what
to
write
about.
At
the
time
I
viewed
writing
as
something
that
there
was
a
formula
for.
I
thought
that
good
writers
had
memorized
the
formula
and
those
who
could
not
write
simply
never
took
the
time
to
learn.
I
have
since
learned
that
this
is
not
true,
but
try
to
explain
something
like
this
to
a
third
grader.
Finally
I
decided
that
I
would
retell
a
folk
tale
that
I
had
heard
from
one
of
our
teachers.
I
could
not
remember
all
the
details
of
the
story
so
I
made
up
what
I
couldn't
remember.
Even
so,
I
felt
terribly
guilty
about
writing
this
story.
Not
until
I
was
older
did
I
realize
that
I
had
feelings
of
guilt
because
I
had
always
believed
that
retelling
an
oral
story
in
your
own
words
was
just
a
sneaky
form
of
plagiarism.
Of
course
to
a
third
grader,
plagiarism
was
something
that
the
dentist
scraped
off
your
teeth.
I
only
knew
that
I
was
stealing
a
space
in
the
honorable
mention
from
someone
who
had
written
an
original
story.
I
am
happy
to
say
that
I
no
longer
feel
guilty
about
this,
although
I
am
still
angry
at
my
kindergarten
art
teacher
for
forgetting
to
my
work
in
the
art
show..
.The
point
is,
I
have
never
forgotten
that
feeling,
and
because
of
it
I
try
extra
hard
to
be
original
in
all
of
my
writings.
I
still
feel
kind
of
strange
writing
about
common
topics
because
I
cannot
shake
the
feeling
that
what
I
believe
is
my
original
writing
is
just
my
version
of
something
I
once
read
or
heard.
After
third
grade,
I
don't
remember
writing
anything
until
my
ninth
grade
honors
English
class.
I
know
that
I
must
have
done
some
writing
during
that
period,
but
nothing
sticks
in
my
memory,
which
in
itself
says
something
about
the
type
of
writing
I
must've
been
doing
at
the
time.
As
near
as
I
can
guess,
during
my
entire
middle
school
career
my
longest
missives
probably
began
something
like
this:
"Sup?
How's
it
hangin'?
I'm
in
reading
class
right
now
and
it
is
sooo
boring.
There
was
this
girl
in
lunch
today
and
she
was
so,
like
weird..I
think
you
get
the
point.
I
mean
really,
is
there
anything
worse
than
the
word
'sup'?
Even
the
word
ain't
has
made
it
into
a
couple
of
dictionaries,
but
'sup'
is
just
the
ultimate
in
lazy
contractions.
Personally
I'm
glad
that
I
don't
talk
like
that
any
longer.
If
I
did,
I
have
a
feeling
I
would
be
so
efficient
at
compounding
words
I
would
only
need
three
or
four
syllables
to
communicate
with
those
few
people
who
spoke
my
language.
The
general
topic
of
my
ninth
grade
English
class
was
early
American
literature.
Writing
was
a
very
important
subject
at
my
high
school.
The
English
department
had
decided
a
few
years
earlier
that
all
students
should
have
a
permanent
writing
folder
in
which
special
assignments
would
be
filed
from
ninth
grade
until
graduation.
This
folder
was
to
be
used
as
tool
for
the
English
department
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
their
teaching
and
other
such
things.
Although
teachers
were
required
to
submit
unmarked
copies
of
the
students'
assignments
to
the
folder,
I
was
extremely
nervous
about
my
first
assignment
for
my
folder.
I
think
it
was
the
word
permanent
that
intimidated
me.
Somehow
I
thought
that
what
I
wrote
for
my
folder
would
be
read
by
everyone
of
importance
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
Hey,
what
did
you
expect,
I
was
only
twelve
at
the
time.
Twelve
year
olds
tend
to
have
a
skewed
view
of
the
real
world.
Moving
on.
Despite
my
fears,
I
still
had
to
write
something,
and
what
was
even
worse
was
that
it
was
a
poetry
assignment.
I
know,
some
of
my
readers
must
be
thinking
that
I'm
crazy
since
poetry
can
be
almost
any
combination
of
words
the
poet
chooses
to
throw
on
a
piece
of
paper.
Well,
once
again,
that
would
be
true
in
the
real
world.
But
not
in
ninth
grade.
Not
only
did
the
poem
have
to
be
in
some
kind
of
traditional
form,
but
it
had
to
have
a
Transcendental
theme.
Let
me
just
say
that
I
am
still
trying
to
put
my
finger
on
what
exactly
Transcendentalism
means,
so
you
can
imagine
I
was
fairly
neurotic
about
writing
this
poem.
I
can't
say
that
there
was
anything
shocking
about
my
writing
process
or
the
way
that
I
came
up
with
an
idea
for
the
poem.
I
just
went
to
bed
one
night
and
had
an
idea.
I
get
most
of
my
ideas
when
I'm
trying
not
to
have
any.
But
when
you're
strapped
for
ideas
you'll
take
them
whenever
and
however
they
come.
So
I
turned
on
the
light
and
grabbed
the
only
writing
implement
I
could
find.
I
believe
it
was
a
short,
skinny,
green
and
white
candy
cane
striped
pen
with
a
feather
at
one
end
and
barely
legible
lime
green
ink.
Of
course
now
that
I
had
inspiration
and
a
pen,
I
had
nothing
to
write
with.
It
was
already
too
late
to
go
downstairs
without
answering
to
my
parents.
I
just
don't
think
that
my
father
would've
bought
it
if
I
told
him
that
I
needed
paper
because
I
was
inspired
at
12:30
A.M.
I'm
sure
he
would've
told
me
that
I
would
be
just
as
inspired
in
the
morning
and
well-rested
to
boot.
But
you
just
can't
let
an
idea
slip
away,
especially
because
of
a
small
detail
like
a
lack
of
paper.
So
I
improvised.
I
wrote
the
original
copy
of
my
poem
on
the
bottom
of
a
tissue
box
in
that
pale
lime
colored
ink.
I
think
that
my
inspirational
story
is
slightly
nicer
than
some
of
the
stories
I
have
heard
from
friends.
They
have
been
inspired
at
such
inconvenient
times
that
they
have
written
anything
from
poems
to
songs
on
various
mediums
ranging
from
their
clothes
or
their
bodies
(arms
or
legs
tend
to
be
the
easiest
to
read),
or
on
a
reasonable
facsimile
of
paper,
such
as
toilet
paper.
No,
I
at
least
did
not
have
to
be
too
ashamed
to
sit
at
my
computer
and
retype
the
words
from
the
bottom
of
my
tissue
box.
And
I
was
able
to
shower
without
fear
of
erasing
my
work.
Looking
back
on
the
poem
I
wrote
I
think
it
ended
up
sounding
kind
of
pretentious,
like
I
was
trying
too
hard
to
write
poetry
the
way
I
thought
it
should
sound.
I
think
it
was
titled
"Utopian
World",
and
there
was
something
in
it
about
the
only
true
Utopian
worlds
being
the
womb
and
the
tomb.
I'm
sure
there
was
some
kind
of
silly
rhyming
lines
including
those
words
though
I
cannot
remember
them
precisely.
Despite
what
I
now
think
of
that
poem,
I
was
very
proud
of
it
at
the
time.
Poetry
has
never
been
my
venue
and
I
was
amazed
to
find
that
I
could
write
anything
even
resembling
poetry.
What
I
have
learned
since
then,
is
that
the
best
poems
describe
something
the
poet
has
actually
experienced,
in
the
simplest
terms
possible.
At
least
that's
what
all
the
poetry
I
like
is
about.
Later
on
I
took
a
class
called
The
Research
Paper.
The
title
is
pretty
self-explanatory.
This
was
a
course
which
all
students
were
required
to
take.
That
fact
is
important
only
because
I
would
not
have
otherwise
signed
up
for
this
class.
The
only
thing
I
detested
more
than
writing
poetry
was
writing
research
papers.
I
didn't
hate
research
papers
for
the
same
reason
that
I
disliked
poetry,
however.
I
did
not,
nor
do
I
now,
detest
poetry.
I
like
to
read
good
poetry,
but
I
am
afraid
to
write
it.
Research
papers
on
the
other
hand,
just
never
made
any
sense
to
me.
To
this
day
I
still
do
not
see
the
purpose
in
writing
ten
or
more
pages
of
regurgitated
facts
that
are
in
no
way
original
to
the
person
rearranging
them.
I
say
rearranging
because
I
do
not
believe
that
one
really
writes
a
research
paper.
At
least
I
never
did.
High
schools
are
not
generally
noted
for
their
acceptance
of
artistic
license,
especially
when
dealing
with
a
form
as
rigid
as
a
research
paper.
Throughout
that
class
I
learned
many
interesting
and
seemingly
organized
ways
to
locate
and
arrange
information
so
that
by
the
time
you
were
ready
to
begin
the
paper
it
would
practically
write
itself.
Unfortunately,
even
after
I
had
spent
endless
hours
copying
my
notes
onto
3x5
note
cards
and
numbering
and
arranging
them
in
chronological
order,
I
still
just
sat
down
at
my
computer
and
wrote
the
paper,
barely
glancing
at
my
notes.
I
guess
the
point
I
am
trying
to
make
is
that
I
have
always
written
the
same
way
and
I
will
probably
continue
to
do
so
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
I
wrote
out
all
of
the
note
cards
because
I
had
to.
They
were
part
of
my
grade.
But
I
never
used
them.
Everyone
writes
differently
which
is
one
thing
that
high
schools
just
are
not
equipped
to
deal
with.
So
I
played
along.
That
is
what
I
learned
from
my
research
paper
class.
Another
thing
I
learned
in
high
school
is
that
you
will
almost
invariably
write
the
worst
papers
of
your
writing
career
if
you
hate
the
project
and
are
completely
uninspired.
I
spent
twelve
weeks
and
thirty
writing
assignments
in
just
such
a
predicament.
My
Creative
Writing
class
required
that
we
hand
in
one
example
of
every
type
of
poetry
that
we
had
learned
about.
Even
though
the
assignments
were
graded
on
form,
not
content,
it
was
a
frustrating
class
to
sit
through.
I
never
have
never
felt
that
writing
in
an
assigned
form
on
an
assigned
topic
does
much
for
the
psyche
of
the
average
high
school
student.
How
could
any
of
the
people
in
my
class
read
e.e.cummings
or
Shakespeare
and
then
go
home
and
write
a
sonnet
or
a
free
form
poem
that
would
be
good
enough
to
be
in
the
same
room
with
a
book
of
'real'
poetry.
Overall,
I
did
not
do
any
of
my
best
work
in
that
class.
I
got
an
A,
most
people
did,
but
I
found
the
exercises
to
be
fruitless
and
demoralizing.
And
then
it
happened.
I
suppose
if
I
were
trying
to
be
dramatic
I
would
say
that
I
had
a
literary
awakening,
but
I
didn't
realize
anything
was
happening
to
me
at
the
time.
My
senior
year
in
high
school
I
was
able
to
take
English
110
at
Lafayette
through
a
special
program.
We
did
a
lot
of
writing
and
the
paper
that
changed
my
ideas
about
writing
was
written
in
that
class.
What
I
learned
from
one
single
paper
is
amazing.
I
still
remember
the
assignment.
We
had
to
write
a
short
five
page
paper
about
someone
or
something
in
our
lives
that
had
made
some
kind
of
impression
on
us.
I
know,
you're
probably
thinking
that
that
doesn't
sound
like
much
to
base
a
paper
on,
but
I
guess
that
was
the
point.
For
the
first
time
in
my
writing
career
I
was
given
the
freedom
to
write
about
absolutely
anything
I
wanted
to
in
whatever
form
I
chose.
Sure,
I
still
had
to
spell
words
correctly
and
use
proper
grammar,
but
this
was
as
free
an
assignment
as
I
had
ever
had.
My
paper
was
about
growing
up
and
spending
time
in
my
grandmother's
kitchen.
As
I
wrote
the
paper
I
found
that
the
things
I
had
learned
in
class
actually
applied
to
what
I
was
writing
and
I
was,
for
the
first
time,
proud
of
what
I
wrote.
After
the
first
draft
of
the
paper
I
met
with
my
professor
to
discuss
the
paper.
To
my
surprise
I
found
that
his
suggestions
were
applicable
to
my
paper
and
I
really
improved
my
paper
after
a
few
more
drafts.
You
must
understand,
I
had
never
before
re-written
anything.
I
was
a
one
draft-spell
check-hand
it
in
kind
of
gal
before
then.
And
this
time
I
even
enjoyed
fixing
my
paper.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I
re-wrote
that
paper
after
the
class
was
over
so
that
I
could
give
a
copy
of
it
to
my
grandparents
for
their
anniversary.
I
cannot
say
that
all
of
my
enthusiasm
was
internal;
my
professor
certainly
had
a
lot
to
do
with
it.
It
was
clear
that
he
loved
what
he
was
teaching
and
he
tried
to
make
the
students
see
things
as
passionately
as
he
did.
He
is
the
reason
I
am
currently
at
Lafayette
and
the
reason
I
am
an
English
major.
He's
also
my
advisor,
but
only
because
I
parked
myself
in
his
office
and
I
begged
until
he
agreed.
I
know
that
is
a
bit
off
the
subject,
and
I
guess
there's
no
reason
for
a
shameless
plug
when
we're
not
allowed
to
use
professor's
names,
but
I'm
leaving
it
in
anyway
just
for
spite.
So
there.
Since
that
experience,
I
have
become
very
fond
of
writing
assignments
in
which
I
am
required
to
analyze
things
such
as
poetry
or
political
theories.
Argument
is
one
of
my
strong
points.
Go
ahead
and
ask
me
what
I
think
about
any
debatable
topic.
I
dare
you.
You'd
better
have
a
few
hours
if
you
want
to
hear
my
point
of
view.
That's
another
thing.
Whenever
I
sit
down
at
my
computer
to
write,
like
now,
for
instance,
I
just
cannot
stop
writing.
I'd
tell
you
my
life
story
if
I
wasn't
given
a
maximum
length.
Even
when
I
am,
I'll
still
fit
in
as
many
tangents
as
possible.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
one
major
way
in
which
my
writing
has
changed
is
that
now,
instead
of
setting
my
line
spacing
at
2.5
and
writing
as
many
meaningless
sentences
as
possible,
I
often
go
back
and
reduce
the
spacing
so
that
I
can
fit
my
paper
into
the
requirements
of
the
assignment.
I
believe
that
everything
I
write
is
meaningful,
even
if
it
doesn't
belong
in
the
paper
I
am
writing.
That's
part
of
the
reason
I
need
a
W.A.
as
badly
as
anyone
else
on
campus.
My
words
have
a
personal,
sentimental
meaning
and
I
just
cannot
get
rid
of
them
after
I
have
committed
them
to
a
piece
of
paper
(or
a
computer
screen).
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I
am
not
changing
one
word
of
this
paper.
You
will
just
have
to
wade
through
anything
that
doesn't
precisely
belong
because
that
will
be
the
most
apt
representation
of
my
writing.
It
will
also
give
anyone
editing
my
paper
lots
of
practice.
Now
I
guess
I
should
end
this
monstrosity
so
that
I
can
attempt
to
fit
this
on
seven
pages
or
some
reasonable
facsimile
of
that.
But
don't
get
your
hopes
up.
