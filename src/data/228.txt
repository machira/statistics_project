"Writing
is
a
distinctive
human
act:
it
defines
the
human
condition,
wrenches
order
from
chaos,
turns
darkness
into
light,
and
gives
life
and
meaning
to
what
was
once
ordinary
and
dead."
After
I
spent
a
long
time
pondering
over
some
of
my
earliest
memories,
I
had
to
be
honest
with
myself.
I
did
not
have
a
damn
clue
when
writing
became
a
major
part
of
my
life.
Somehow
it
is
though.
I
want
to
be
a
writer,
so
there
must
be
some
explanation
as
to
how
it
all
came
about.
I
kept
telling
myself
that
there
probably
was
some
moment
where
my
first
grade
teacher
gave
me
a
big
smilely
face
on
something
I
wrote.
This
event
was
probably
what
inspired
me
to
become
a
writer.
I
wanted
to
remember
an
event
like
this
and
use
it
as
an
amusing
intro
to
my
paper
so
badly.
However,
I
did
not
remember
any
smilely
face.
In
fact,
I
did
not
remember
any
grade
school
moment
that
really
helped
to
explain
how
I
got
to
the
point
where
I
am
today
with
my
writing.
It
was
only
when
I
stopped
searching
for
amusing
memories
of
my
writing
that
I
really
came
to
any
understanding.
Instead
I
started
to
think
about
pivotal
moments
in
my
life,
and
how
these
moments
effected
me,
and
furthermore
what
role
my
writing
played
in
these
changes.
In
many
ways,
as
I
went
through
different
phases
throughout
my
life,
I
discovered
that
my
writing
helps
me
look
back
and
define
who
I
was.
My
writing
has
always
been
about
exploration,
and
it
has
taken
me
many
years
to
finally
come
to
this
realization.
I
like
ideally
to
compare
my
writing
to
one
of
my
favorite
painters.
Pablo
Picasso
attempted
to
examine
life
from
a
number
of
different
angles
and
perspectives
in
his
work.
I
admire
Picasso
for
his
bold
initiative
to
search
and
explore
himself
in
his
art.
In
many
ways,
as
a
writer,
I
have
attempted
to
emulate
the
exploration
seen
in
Picasso.
My
writing
has
become
almost
a
journey.
One
moment
or
memory,
such
as
a
big
smilely
face,
can
not
capture
the
essence
of
a
journey,
especially
a
journey
that
is
not
nearly
over
for
me.
Today,
I
feel
that
it
is
the
ability
to
go
outside
the
lines,
to
search,
explore
and
most
of
all
discover,
that
sets
a
great
writer
from
an
ordinary
one.
As
I
began
to
think
about
my
feelings
about
my
writing
now,
I
started
to
remember
how
I
came
to
my
belief
system.
One
of
the
pivotal
moments
in
my
life
took
place
in
third
grade.
This
is
when
I
met
my
best
friend
Dan.
Dan
has
always
been
different,
and
his
angle
of
observation
has
always
been
far
from
mainstream.
I
admired
Dan,
and
after
I
met
him
I
too
began
to
try
to
look
at
things
differently.
Together
we
were
definitely
an
unusual
pair.
Dan
and
I
always
attempted
to
reverse
the
way
we
looked
at
things,
always
trying
to
go
outside
of
normal,
or
conventional.
We
imagined
new
dimensions
and
perspectives
on
life.
We
would
do
this
for
fun,
telling
stories
with
our
offbeat
sense
of
humor,
but
we
would
also
use
our
different
perspective
in
school.
We
attempted
to
test
ideas
that
teachers
told
us
were
facts,
or
the
may
things
should
and
"must"
be
done.
Sometimes
we
believed
in
our
betrayal
of
the
norm,
and
sometimes
we
would
just
do
it
to
annoy
people.
The
point
is
that
from
Dan
I
learned
to
break
convention
and
experiment
with
new
ideas.
This
would
be
something
that
carried
into
my
writing.
Some
teachers
would
dislike
me
trying
to
change
rules
that
they
had
been
trying
to
teach,
others
would
praise
me
for
it.
As
the
years
went
on
though
I
learned
not
to
care
so
much
about
how
teachers
felt
about
my
writing.
I
didn't
necessarily
write
for
them
all
the
time.
I
really
learned
to
write
for
myself.
This
is
one
of
the
greatest
skills
I
have
learned
in
my
writing
process.
Writing
for
myself
became
a
very
important
aspect
of
my
life
in
Middle
School.
As
if
the
trauma
of
being
a
pre-pubescent
teen
was
not
enough,
in
seventh
grade
my
parents
separated.
It
was
then
that
I
turned
to
writing
to
help
console
me.
During
these
difficult
years
I
kept
a
journal.
I
didn't
really
want
to
talk
to
people
about
how
I
felt,
but
writing
down
what
I
was
going
through
was
in
many
ways
self
healing.
My
writing
was
usually
free
writing,
were
I
would
just
let
my
emotions
drain
out
onto
the
page.
I
also
wrote
poetry,
which
looking
back
upon
now,
probably
would
have
scared
the
hell
out
of
Marilyn
Manson.
Although
some
of
my
writing
was
kind
of
sick
and
twisted,
the
good
thing
was
that
I
didn't
have
to
keep
all
my
feelings
inside.
They
had
a
place
to
go.
Red
Smith
once
said
that
"Writing
is
easy.
You
just
open
a
vein
and
bleed."
Without
knowing
it,
I
was
teaching
myself
to
really
become
part
of
what
I
was
writing.
I
was
just
bleeding
my
emotions
onto
the
page.
All
the
great
writing
skills
that
I
had
acquired
in
my
early
life
somehow
got
lost
in
Freshman
year
English.
I
had
a
horrible
teacher
who
pounded
the
idea
of
fundamentals
of
writing
into
our
heads.
This
teacher
would
tell
us
that
there
is
a
clear
right
way,
and
a
wrong
way
to
write.
Also,
being
in
high
school
made
cultural
determinants
a
bigger
role
in
how
I
looked
at
the
world,
and
consequently
on
how
I
would
write.
I
still
attempted
to
question
things,
and
look
at
things
from
a
new
perspective
on
my
own,
but
as
grades
became
more
and
more
important
I
found
myself
falling
into
the
standard
of
how
we
were
expected
to
write.
If
I
didn't
write
the
way
we
were
supposed
to
then
I
would
run
the
risk
of
getting
a
bad
grade,
and
if
I
got
a
bad
grade
I
wouldn't
get
into
a
good
college,
and
that
just
wouldn't
be
culturally
acceptable...right?
Looking
back
at
papers
I
wrote
freshman
year,
it
is
some
of
the
worst
writing
I
have
ever
done.
However,
I
probably
still
did
well
on
them.
The
writing
was
not
at
all
self
gratifying
though.
I
was
simply
spitting
out
how
I
had
been
taught
to
write,
and
how
I
was
expected
to
write.
I
was
not
looking
at
topics
from
new
and
different
perspectives,
and
I
was
not
exploring
or
discovering
anything.
What
I
wrote
had
already
been
"written"
in
a
large
sense,
however
I
was
not
writing.
Towards
the
end
of
sophomore
year,
and
definitely
by
the
beginning
of
junior
year,
I
was
ready
to
reevaluate
how
I
was
looking
at
the
world.
I
wanted
to
find
what
I
had
lost
in
my
freshman
year.
Part
of
rediscovering
myself
came
through
looking
again
at
mg
best
friend.
Dan
never
made
the
mistake
of
falling
into
the
trap
of
conformity.
He
has
always
blazed
his
own
path,
which
consequently
led
him
to
do
poorly
in
our
freshman
year
class.
He
didn't
care
though.
Better
teachers
realized
the
strength
in
what
Dan
did.
Dan
has
become
a
terrific
actor
and
musician.
He
is
also
one
of
the
most
talented
young
writers
that
I
have
ever
known.
He
is
truly
an
original,
and
I
accredit
this
to
his
ability
to
look
at
the
world
through
different
perspectives.
By
looking
at
Dan
I
decided
that
I
was
never
again
going
to
let
set
standards
completely
dictate
how
I
write.
In
addition
to
Dan's
influence,
mg
rediscovery
was
aided
because
I
had
begun
to
travel
extensively
at
the
end
of
my
sophomore
year.
That
summer
I
visited
9
countries,
traveling
all
throughout
Europe,
and
parts
of
the
Middle
East.
I
found
that
there
were
so
many
different
ways
to
see
the
world,
through
the
eyes
of
different
cultures.
Mg
horizons
were
truly
expanded,
and
when
I
returned
to
high
school
junior
gear
I
was
ready
to
in
cooperate
this
into
my
writing.
I
was
tired
of
writing
from
my
cultural
perspective,
and
I
opened
up
the
doorways
to
many
different
ideas.
Luckily,
my
English
teachers
junior
and
especially
senior
year
encouraged
this
type
of
writing.
Junior
year
I
began
to
write
a
number
of
creative
stories.
I
did
this
usually
for
fun,
and
I
still
have
a
number
that
I
started
and
never
completed.
Writing
creatively
was
great
for
me,
because
it
presented
no
boundaries.
In
the
middle
of
the
year
when
the
teacher
assigned
a
creative
paper,
I
was
thrilled.
After
reading
my
paper
my
teacher
gave
me
one
of
my
favorite
reactions
I've
gotten
from
anything
I've
written.
I
remember
he
stopped
me
in
the
hall
and
said
"You're
story
was
really
dark,
a
little
sick,
and
definitely
twisted.
I
absolutely
loved
it,
you
got
an
A."
I
remember
that
with
this
story
I
attempted
to
go
so
far
beyond
the
line
of
ordinary,
that
I
almost
forced
the
reader
to
come
with
me.
My
teacher
still
remembers
that
piece,
and
he
mentions
it
every
time
I
see
him.
I
accredit
my
success
with
this
writing
to
my
ability
to
explore
new
and
different
angles
on
life.
I
went
back
and
remembered
when
writing
was
just
for
fun,
and
I
allowed
myself
to
yet
lost
in
the
piece
and
discover
myself
along
the
way.
Today,
I
acknowledge
that
it
is
very
simple
to
label
me
a
white,
middle
class,
suburban
kid.
I
wont
argue
that
at
face
value,
this
is
what
I
am.
However,
if
someone
tried
to
make
the
argument
that
these
cultural
factors
determine
absolutely
who
I
am
as
a
writer,
then
I
mould
be
very
offended.
Whoever
makes
this
argument
has
not
seen
all
the
things
that
I
have
seen
in
my
life.
They
also
cannot
probe
into
the
dimensions
of
my
mind,
and
where
my
thoughts
might
take
me.
My
mission
as
a
writer
now
is
to
escape
the
every
day.
What
am
I
going
to
learn
if
I
write
about
what
I
already
know?
Last
semester
I
was
debating
with
a
fellow
student.
This
student
happened
to
be
black,
and
he
told
me
that
I
could
not
write
from
the
perspective
of
a
black
person,
because
I
would
know
nothing
about
it.
I
responded
by
writing
a
story
where
my
protagonist
was
a
black
woman.
Clearly
I
recognize
where
I
am
from,
and
the
boundaries
of
my
culture...these
are
the
lines
some
people
have
told
us
to
stay
within.
I
figure
the
lines
exist,
only
for
us
to
see,
and
so
we
are
able
to
travel
outside
of
them.
Last
semester
I
realized
that
why
I
want
to
be
a
writer
is
to
take
risks.
A
blank
page
presents
innumerable
possibilities.
Every
time
I
begin
to
write
there
is
a
sense
of
fear,
and
as
I
continue
to
write
the
fear
turns
into
mounting
excitement.
The
exploration
involved
with
writing
is
the
exciting
part,
and
the
finished
product
many
times
is
a
let
down.
As
long
as
the
writing
process
has
taught
me
something
though,
then
the
finished
product
has
done
it's
job
in
some
respect.
I
am
constantly
learning
from
good
and
bad
papers
I
have
written.
This
sense
of
discovery
is
what
makes
it
all
worth
it
for
me.
This
sense
of
discovery
is
why
I
want
to
be
a
writer.
