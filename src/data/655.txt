WA
Summer
Assignment
In
second
grade
I
set
out
to
write
a
hardcover
novel.
It
had
a
title
and
a
vibrantly
illustrated
cover
before
pencil
had
even
been
set
to
paper.
In
the
rational,
creative
mind
of
a
seven
year
old,
the
title
was
a
starting
point
that
would
define
the
story
to
follow,
giving
direction
to
the
writer
as
to
how
the
plot
would
unfold.
Naturally,
being
the
first
thing
noticed,
the
cover
was
the
most
important
aspect
of
a
book
D
whoever
said
NYou
canOt
judge
a
book
by
its
coverO
clearly
had
never
written
a
hardcover
novel.
So,
of
course,
I
broke
out
my
colored
pencils
and
painstakingly
drew
the
main
character
on
the
thick
white
cardboard
canvas,
taking
great
care
to
ensure
that
her
hair
had
the
perfect
little
flip
at
the
end
and
her
crown
was
perched
perfectly
on
her
head.
I
had
not
yet
graduated
to
bubble
letters,
so
I
wrote
the
insightful
title
in
my
skinny
second
grader
scrawl,
the
shaky,
uneven
letters
suspended
mid-tumble
above
the
protagonistOs
head.
Lastly,
I
wrote
my
name
in
the
bottom
right
corner,
proceeded
by
the
all-commanding,
obviously
important
NByO.
Once
the
cover
was
complete
in
all
its
glory,
I
was
ready
to
fill
the
pages
with
an
adventurous
tale
that
everyone
would
want
to
read.
I
imagine
I
was
frustrated
by
my
capacity
for
language,
which
was
insufficient
to
tell
the
story
I
wanted
to
tell.
IOm
sure
my
parents
were
even
more
frustrated
by
my
constant
questions
about
how
to
spell
the
words
I
wanted
to
use.
The
story
that
came
out
on
paper
was
oversimplified
and
confused.
I
had
too
many
ideas
for
the
plot,
too
many
places
I
wanted
my
character
to
go
and
too
many
things
I
wanted
her
to
do.
My
pencil
bearing
hand
and
my
ambitious
mind
did
not
have
the
stamina
to
fill
the
entire
fifty
page
blank
book
bestowed
on
me
by
my
teacher,
who
allowed
every
student
three
of
the
empty
hard
covers
to
fill
with
whatever
they
desired
to
write
down.
My
hard
cover
novel
would
not
be
the
first
of
my
writing
endeavors
to
end
in
a
perpetual
ellipse.
I
had
a
certain
level
of
enthusiasm
for
writing,
whether
it
derived
from
the
worldOs
presumably
high
regard
for
authors
or
a
medium
through
which
to
live
vicariously
as
a
slew
of
princesses,
pop
stars,
and
really
cool
teenagers.
However,
throughout
elementary
school,
the
projects
I
managed
to
complete
were
more
pragmatic,
usually
school
assignments
with
a
focused
lens
to
guide
me
to
the
finish.
The
same
white
binding
that
was
meant
to
hold
my
New
York
Times
best
seller
eventually
held
my
third
grade
FatherOs
Day
project.
The
cover
and
illustrations
were
as
important
as
ever,
but
the
pages
were
short
and
sweet
and
had
real
meaning.
At
this
point
in
my
education
and
mental
development,
writing
was
not
about
a
flair
for
language
or
appealing
syntax.
Rather
then
capturing
every
essence
of
ideas
through
powerful
rhetoric,
the
goal
of
writing
was
to
eternalize
ideas
on
paper.
The
transfusion
of
thoughts
from
intangible
fragments
to
words
on
a
page
was
stripped
of
complexities,
allowing
our
young
minds
to
experience
the
bare
building
blocks
of
writing.
The
words
we
write
when
we
are
young
may
be
our
most
honest,
as
there
is
nothing
hiding
in
their
simplicity.
I
was
not
grasping
for
NReasons
My
Dad
is
The
BestO;
I
knew
exactly
what
I
wanted
to
say,
it
was
just
a
matter
of
writing
it
down.
At
that
age,
there
was
no
beating
around
the
bush
and
no
window
for
misinterpretation.
In
fifth
grade
I
learned
the
permanent,
revealing
nature
of
the
written
word.
My
English
teacher,
Ms.
Fahy,
had
us
write
in
composition
notebooks,
whether
we
chose
to
write
poems,
anecdotes,
or
reflective
journal
entries.
In
an
effort
to
motivate
us
to
write
often
and
freely,
we
were
allowed
to
fold
a
page
over
and
mark
it
as
NPersonalO,
notifying
her
not
to
read
that
entry.
On
September
11th,
my
homeroom
class
was
given
the
alarming
news
of
that
morningOs
events
shortly
before
being
ushered
into
Ms.
FahyOs
classroom.
Keeping
with
routine,
we
sat
at
our
assigned
seats
and
took
out
our
journals
for
our
free
write
period.
It
was
probably
suggested
that
we
write
about
what
had
happened.
My
entry
from
that
day
is
towards
the
beginning
of
the
notebook,
as
it
was
written
only
a
few
days
into
the
school
year.
I
reacted
to
what
I
had
been
told,
using
words
like
NterribleO
and
NhorrificO,
which
I
had
heard
slip
from
the
mouths
of
teachers
but
lacked
meaning
on
the
page.
At
the
time
I
was
misinformed,
had
not
grasped
what
I
had
heard,
and
probably
would
not
have
understood
the
immensity
of
the
events
even
if
I
had
been
given
the
correct
information.
I
wrote
what
I
felt,
ending
with
an
exclamation
that
I
hoped
my
dad
would
not
come
home
late
that
night
from
his
job
in
the
city.
When
I
looked
back
at
that
entry
a
few
days
later,
I
was
embarrassed
by
my
naivety
and
folded
the
page
over,
marking
it
as
private.
My
first
reaction,
in
all
itsO
misunderstanding,
is
preserved
in
that
journal
entry,
embodying
the
widespread
confusion
of
that
very
moment
and
my
unsuspecting
youth
at
that
time.
As
I
got
older,
writing
assignments
gradually
moved
away
from
fiction,
and
eventually
my
independent
creative
writing
ventures
ended
all
together.
Although
I
did
not
possess
much
of
a
motivation
to
write
creatively,
in
my
freshman
year
of
high
school
I
got
a
surprisingly
refreshing,
momentary
break
from
non-fiction
academic
writing.
In
English
class
we
were
asked
to
base
a
short
story
off
a
listing
in
the
police
blotter.
Taking
my
inspiration
from
a
call
about
a
man
who
locked
himself
in
the
local
pharmacy
bathroom
for
two
hours,
I
wrote
about
a
characterOs
hesitation
and
attempt
to
psych
himself
up
to
propose
to
his
girlfriend.
In
a
later
assignment,
I
chose
to
write
a
follow-up
about
the
manOs
girlfriend,
as
she
waited
for
him
in
a
restaurant
down
the
street
from
the
pharmacy.
In
my
eyes,
this
was
a
fairly
mature
piece
of
fiction,
so
different
from
my
elementary
school
stories
in
which
I
had
attempted
to
boil
an
entire
novel
down
to
a
few
pages.
Given
a
good
starting
point,
I
had
managed
to
stay
focused
and
write
a
story
that
did
not
try
to
be
anything
it
wasnOt.
The
characters
were
not
people
I
aspired
to
be,
but
they
were
products
of
my
imagination,
and
I
felt
that
I
knew
them
well
enough
to
know
their
next
thought
or
move.
Going
into
my
junior
year,
all
students
were
required
to
read
a
book
examining
urban
planning
and
geography
in
America,
and
write
a
single
essay
to
be
submitted
for
both
English
and
U.S.
History.
When
I
received
my
essay
grades
for
each
class,
they
were
considerably
different.
I
realized
that
I
may
have
to
tailor
my
writing
to
appeal
to
different
readers,
in
this
case
the
teachers
who
were
grading
my
work.
Additionally,
the
subjects
of
English
and
US
History
have
different
purposes,
and
therefore
different
ways
to
present
the
same
message.
What
was
effective
for
one
was
not
necessarily
equally
effective
for
the
other.
The
U.S.
History
class
proved
to
present
the
first
big
challenge
in
my
academic
writing
career.
I
wrote
multiple
position,
contrast,
and
argumentative
papers.
My
first
grade
was
lower
then
I
was
used
to,
and
my
paper
was
littered
with
comments
about
how
I
had
misfired
in
the
introduction
and
I
needed
to
be
more
concise
in
the
body
of
the
paper.
The
rest
of
the
class
seemed
to
know
what
they
were
doing,
as
they
had
had
the
same
teacher
the
year
before.
He
wanted
my
introductions
to
be
at
least
a
page
long,
where
I
was
used
to
the
standard
six
to
eight
sentence
paragraph.
He
also
had
a
strict
three-page
limit
on
all
the
papers,
which
seemed
impossible
considering
the
immense
amount
of
information,
analyses,
and
personal
opinion
we
were
expected
to
include.
Writing
concisely
had
never
been
my
strong
point,
and
I
was
confused
as
to
how
my
writing
could
be
stylistic
and
smooth
given
such
little
room
to
work
with
language.
The
page
limit
turned
out
to
be
a
manageable
obstacle,
and
as
I
learned
to
be
straightforward
in
my
writing
I
received
better
grades
in
the
class.
I
also
wrote
the
first
papers
that
seemed
really
relevant
to
me,
responding
to
a
book
about
living
on
minimum
wage
and
another
about
the
events
leading
up
to
the
September
11th
terrorist
attacks.
These
papers
had
meaning
and
passion
behind
them,
and
were
successfully
capped
at
the
three-page
limit.
My
senior
year
of
high
school
I
applied
to
be
a
student
columnist
for
the
local
newspaper.
One
to
two
times
a
month,
I
would
submit
a
500-600
word
column
about
a
topic
of
my
choice.
For
the
first
time,
my
writing
was
not
just
between
my
mom,
my
teacher,
and
me.
The
fact
that
I
had
complete
freedom
in
the
subject
of
each
column
made
my
first
excursion
into
non-academic
writing
even
more
nerve-wracking.
The
topics
I
chose
to
write
about
made
a
statement
as
to
what
I
considered
important,
making
the
publication
of
my
writing
feel
even
more
personal
than
just
my
words
thrown
together
on
a
page
for
the
entire
community
to
read.
I
rationalized
that
no
one
reads
the
student
column
in
the
newspaper,
so
it
did
not
really
matter
what
I
wrote.
My
first
column
ran
on
the
seventh
anniversary
of
September
11th.
I
wrote
a
reflection
on
my
experience,
a
retrospective
rendition
of
my
confused
journal
entry
seven
years
prior,
giving
my
view
on
how
America
has
changed
since
that
monumental
day.
I
wanted
to
offer
insight
into
the
experience
of
those
who
grew
up
in
post
9/11
America;
the
kids
who
were
old
enough
to
witness
the
attacks
on
television
and
to
be
scared
by
them,
but
were
too
young
to
understand
the
complex
history
and
relations
leading
up
to
the
catastrophic
footage
continually
replaying
on
their
TVs.
It
felt
good
to
write
for
a
purpose,
and
to
hear
the
positive
response
from
my
neighbors
and
peers,
who
either
identified
with
or
were
struck
by
what
I
had
to
say.
At
the
same
time
I
was
writing
columns
for
the
public
eye,
I
was
still
writing
papers
in
school,
mostly
for
my
twelfth
grade
AP
English
class.
Like
the
newspaper
editor,
my
English
teacher
allowed
us
freedom
in
our
writing,
and
unlimited
space
to
write.
I
was
very
excited
by
the
lack
of
a
maximum
page
number,
because
despite
learning
how
to
write
concisely
the
previous
year,
I
still
struggled
to
culminate
all
my
ideas
into
a
limited
space
and
liked
free
range
when
appropriate.
Even
without
a
length
requirement,
I
continued
to
edit
my
papers
for
succinctness
and
clarity.
My
teacher
emphasized
that
if
you
cannot
clearly
verbalize
your
thesis
and
its
supporting
ideas,
then
you
are
not
ready
to
write
your
paper.
I
found
it
very
helpful
to
talk
my
ideas
out
with
another
person,
even
one
who
was
not
familiar
with
the
book
or
topic
of
choice.
This
practice
has
stuck
with
me
into
college,
and
has
helped
me
to
maintain
focus
in
my
writing.
If
I
do
not
have
a
clear
grasp
on
the
basic
foundation
of
a
paper,
it
often
leads
to
structuring
problems,
and
I
have
trouble
getting
started.
I
have
a
slew
of
ideas
in
mind,
but
I
am
not
positive
about
the
best
way
to
connect
them
to
build
an
effective
piece.
Unable
to
choose
the
perfect
metaphor
or
rhetoric
for
a
sentence,
I
often
find
myself
describing
the
same
thing
in
six
different
ways.
This
leads
to
a
fairly
long,
laborious
process,
as
I
struggle
identifying
the
most
efficient
course
of
words
and
supporting
points
to
get
my
overall
idea
across.
My
grandfather,
who
wrote
a
book
on
computer
programming,
told
me
that
he
started
his
first
draft
by
channeling
all
his
anger
at
his
company
and
co-workers
into
the
introduction,
with
no
filter
for
vile
insults
or
curse
words.
Once
his
thoughts
were
on
the
computer
screen,
he
was
able
to
clean
up
the
draft
and
make
it
presentable
enough
to
send
to
his
editor.
Although
this
method
is
appealing,
I
am
not
yet
able
to
throw
all
my
energy,
unrestrained,
into
a
splash
of
words
on
the
screen.
However,
when
I
get
a
pen
and
paper,
I
find
I
can
write
more
freely.
There
is
something
about
the
perfectly
formed
letters
and
sterile
black-white
contrast
of
a
computer
screen
that
sometimes
slows
me
down,
making
me
go
back
and
read
an
entire
paragraph
before
generating
the
next
sentence.
When
I
am
writing
by
hand,
the
thoughts
flow
more
naturally,
and
although
the
language
is
not
precise
and
the
syntax
is
jumpy,
my
ideas
become
clearer
and
I
can
see
how
they
all
fit
together.
When
I
take
what
I
have
written
to
the
screen,
I
am
able
to
tweak
it
until
I
am
satisfied.
The
initial
free
write
helps
to
kick
my
mind
into
gear,
immersing
me
in
my
topic
and
giving
me
a
better
grasp
on
my
network
of
ideas.
Often,
I
use
this
method
when
writing
an
introduction
or
conclusion,
and
at
various
points
where
I
feel
my
thoughts
are
getting
lost
in
the
computer
keys
and
the
stagnant
conformity
of
my
words
on
the
screen.
I
recently
concluded
my
summer
internship
at
a
Westchester
County
magazine.
Working
for
a
regional
magazine
allowed
me
the
opportunity
to
write,
and
to
observe
the
businessOs
inner-workings
from
a
relatively
close
standpoint.
It
also
put
me
in
a
position
to
speak
to
the
magazineOs
editor
about
my
experience
as
an
intern,
and
her
experience
in
the
field.
She
told
me
that
she
went
into
the
publishing
business
excited
about
exercising
her
flair
for
language,
and
soon
learned
that
the
words
she
slaved
over
were
often
the
ones
cut
out
in
editing.
This
was
exactly
the
way
I
had
felt
after
receiving
the
final
drafts
of
my
two
pieces;
I
recognized
certain
places
where
my
voice
still
showed
through,
but
I
felt
much
of
the
graceful
language
I
had
used
to
frame
the
information
had
been
eliminated.
She
acknowledged
that
she
had
drastically
cut
down
my
last
introduction,
and
explained
that
I
needed
to
jump
into
the
story
faster;
the
readers
were
either
interested
in
what
I
had
to
say
or
not,
and
trying
to
convince
them
was
like
revving
a
carOs
engine
before
making
any
progress.
Writing,
she
said,
is
like
tailoring
a
dress.
You
need
to
look
at
the
entire
piece
and
decide
where
you
really
need
more
fabric,
where
the
words
will
be
most
useful
D
if
you
cut
down
the
introduction,
you
can
include
more
information
in
the
body.
Overall,
I
had
done
a
good
job.
It
was
very
reassuring
to
me
that
she
understood
how
I
felt,
and
I
really
appreciated
her
feedback.
I
was
not
that
surprised
to
hear
that
I
could
work
more
on
being
concise,
as
this
has
always
been
a
problem
for
me.
Whenever
other
students
were
widening
their
margins
to
make
their
papers
longer,
I
was
desperately
looking
for
ways
to
make
my
paper
shorter.
However,
as
I
experience
writing
in
more
venues
and
for
different
purposes,
I
become
more
aware
of
and
learn
new
ways
to
manage
my
weaknesses.
With
age
and
experience,
I
feel
I
have
more
to
express,
and
more
then
one
way
to
do
it
effectively.
Rather
than
letting
this
drag
me
into
a
writing
process
confused
with
too
many
words
and
repetitive
ideas,
I
continually
try
to
harness
it
to
make
my
writing
richer
and
deeper,
adding
substance
without
necessarily
adding
length.
Although
my
perception
of
the
world
has
definitely
evolved
since
I
began
writing
my
first
compositions
twelve
years
ago,
with
self-examination
and
endless
practice,
I
can
still
regain
the
simplicity
and
honesty
of
my
third
grade
words.
