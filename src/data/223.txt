Literacy
Narrative
From
the
time
I
first
started
writing
up
until
the
present
day,
my
style
of
writing
has
changed
in
many
ways.
I
have
gone
from
writing
in
pencil
to
typing
on
a
computer,
and
from
writing
stories
about
family
vacations
to
writing
25
page
research
papers.
Since
first
learning
how
to
write
the
alphabet
my
experience
has
been
that
writing
is
one
of
the
best
forms
of
expression.
My
earliest
memory
of
writing
is
from
the
second
grade.
Mrs.
Cobb
was
my
teacher
and
boy
did
she
love
for
us
to
write.
Each
student
had
his
or
her
own
book
of
stories
and
poems,
and
we
were
required
to
write
in
it
on
a
regular
basis.
Since
we
had
not
learned
to
write
in
cursive
yet
the
books
were
all
written
in
print,
and
because
we
were
not
allowed
to
write
in
pen
they
were
written
in
pencil.
I
remember
writing
a
poem
about
an
acorn
and
a
story
about
a
bunny
rabbit
that
could
not
find
his
home.
I
remember
thinking
that
I
was
such
a
great
writer,
and
now
I
look
back
and
laugh.
Things
were
so
much
easier
back
then.
There
was
so
little
to
worry
about
because
you
had
not
learned
anything
yet.
In
that
same
year
each
student
in
my
class
had
to
write
a
book
of
their
own.
We
were
each
given
a
hard
cover
book
with
blank
pages
inside.
We
could
write
about
whatever
we
wanted,
and
it
could
even
be
illustrated.
The
title
of
my
book
was
The
Little
Princess.
It
was
a
story
about
a
little
princess
who
was
sad
because
she
could
not
find
a
little
prince
to
marry.
Of
course
in
the
end
she
found
her
prince
and
they
lived
happily
ever
after.
My
book
was
written
in
pencil,
in
my
neatest
penmanship.
It
was
even
illustrated
and
colored
with
magic
markers.
My
mom
was
so
proud
of
that
book.
She
still
has
it
to
this
day.
The
fact
that
she
loved
it
so
much
made
me
feel
like
I
was
on
top
of
the
world.
It
was
in
Mrs.
Reilly's
third
grade
class
that
I
learned
to
write
in
cursive.
I
thought
it
was
going
to
be
so
hard
to
learn
how
to
write
in
cursive.
After
all,
I
just
begun
to
write
well
in
print.
The
learning
was
not
as
hard
as
I
had
anticipated
and
I
was
actually
pretty
good
at
it.
By
fourth
grade
I
felt
as
though
I
was
a
pro.
It
was
then
that
I
decided
to
start
a
diary.
My
diary
contained
my
deepest
darkest
secrets
about
my
life.
I
would
write
about
the
boy
I
thought
was
cute,
or
the
fight
I
had
gotten
into
with
my
mom.
I
could
even
write
about
the
annoying
girl
who
sat
behind
me,
or
my
biggest
fears.
I
had
the
power
to
write
about
anything
I
wanted
because
no
one
was
going
to
read
or
judge
it.
I
loved
that
freedom
and
I
kept
that
diary
for
quite
some
time.
In
the
fifth
grade
I
learned
about
an
entirely
new
kind
of
writing
--
the
research
paper.
I
found
it
hard
to
imagine
writing
a
paper
using
information
out
of
a
book
as
opposed
to
out
of
your
imagination.
Our
first
research
assignment
was
to
pick
a
state
and
write
a
paper
on
its
history.
I
wrote
on
the
history
of
Massachusetts
and
I
got
my
first
A.
For
the
next
assignment
I
wrote
about
scorpions.
It
was
a
topic
that
I
did
not
find
interesting,
and
I
thought
writing
the
paper
was
torturous.
Little
did
I
know
that
it
was
something
I
should
get
used
to.
The
only
writing
that
I
really
remember
from
junior
high
school
was
a
paper
on
the
Enigma
War.
It
was
a
research
paper,
but
not
only
that,
it
was
a
group
paper
as
well.
I
would
have
to
say
that
it
was
probably
the
hardest
assignment
I
have
ever
had.
There
were
four
people
in
my
group,
including
me,
and
we
each
had
a
different
idea
for
the
assignment.
Trying
to
compromise
all
of
our
ideas
was
a
project
in
itself.
Once
we
had
that
figured
out
the
problems
continued.
There
was
one
girl
in
the
group
who
never
showed
up
to
our
meetings.
Without
her
material
the
rest
of
us
could
not
do
much
with
ours,
and
eventually
we
were
all
working
twice
as
hard
to
make
up
for
her
slack.
We
spoke
to
our
teacher
and
explained
what
was
going
on.
He
told
us
not
to
worry,
that
our
hard
work
would
pay
off
in
the
end.
The
night
before
the
paper
was
due
the
group
met
at
my
house
and
the
girl
who
never
showed
up
to
our
meetings
told
us
that
there
was
a
section
in
the
paper
that
she
did
not
like.
We
explained
to
her
that
we
had
worked
very
hard
on
the
paper
without
much
help
from
her,
and
that
we
were
not
going
to
change
anything.
This
paper
taught
us
that
working
in
a
group
is
a
challenging
task,
but
you
have
to
make
sacrifices
and
compromise
to
make
things
right.
It
turned
out
to
be
a
great
learning
experience
both
academically
and
socially.
When
I
got
to
high
school
I
became
good
friends
with
a
girl
named
Amanda.
She
loved
to
write
poetry,
and
she
got
me
into
writing
it
as
well.
Writing
poetry
was
almost
like
writing
my
fourth
grade
diary.
I
could
write
anything
I
wanted
to.
I
had
a
freedom
that
I
had
forgotten
existed.
I
did
not
share
my
poems
with
anyone.
There
were
a
select
few
that
I
would
read
to
Amanda,
but
that
was
it.
She
always
told
me
how
good
they
were,
and
we
would
take
turns
reading
and
listening.
She
definitely
boosted
my
confidence
in
my
ability
to
write.
I
even
submitted
one
of
my
poems
into
a
poetry
contest,
and
it
was
printed
in
the
literary
magazine
of
the
high
school.
That
was
one
of
the
last
times
I
wrote
creatively.
In
the
ninth
grade
I
was
introduced
to
the
term
paper.
It
was
to
be
15-20
pages,
and
it
had
to
be
typed.
We
had
a
list
of
author's
we
could
write
about,
and
I
chose
Michael
Crichton.
I
wrote
about
his
life
and
his
various
accomplishments.
We
had
to
footnote
the
paper,
and
have
a
works
cited
page.
The
paper
took
me
a
long
time
to
write,
but
in
the
end
it
all
paid
off.
I
got
a
90%
and
a
comment
that
read,
Nice
job
researching
Crichton.
I
was
so
proud
of
that
comment
because
the
teacher
was
known
for
being
a
tough
grader
and
not
very
generous
with
compliments.
My
eleventh
grade
English
teacher
had
us
do
a
lot
of
writing
on
very
debatable
topics,
such
as
abortion
and
the
death
penalty.
I
enjoyed
this
type
of
writing
very
much
because
it
allowed
me
to
voice
my
opinion
on
these
topics
in
my
own
way.
I
did
very
well
in
this
class,
and
I
think
it
was
because
I
was
writing
on
topics
that
I
enjoyed.
I
was
not
being
forced
to
write
about
something
I
did
not
care
about.
In
this
same
class
I
also
had
to
write
an
essay
on
a
person
who
instilled
a
strong
sense
of
value
in
me.
I
wrote
about
my
best
friend,
Chris,
and
when
I
got
the
paper
back
it
said
excellent
across
the
top.
Chris
asked
if
he
could
read
it,
so
I
let
him.
He
was
in
tears
by
the
time
he
was
finished,
and
he
said
it
was
the
nicest
thing
anyone
had
ever
done
for
him.
I
used
this
essay
and
variations
of
it
as
the
essay
on
most
of
my
college
applications.
I
felt
it
best
described
who
I
was,
and
whom
I
wanted
to
be
like.
Once
I
entered
college
I
thought
that
I
was
sufficiently
prepared
for
my
writing
courses.
I
had
written
a
few
decently
lengthed
papers
in
high
school,
and
had
done
fairly
well
on
them.
My
first
year
seminar
went
well,
and
I
enjoyed
the
class
very
much.
I
did
well
on
my
assignments
and
in
the
class
as
a
whole.
Perhaps
this
was
because
I
enjoyed
the
topic
of
the
class.
My
first
year
writing
class
was
a
completely
different
story.
When
I
entered
my
first
year
writing
class
I
figured
I
would
do
well
because
I
had
done
so
well
in
my
seminar
class.
I
was
very
mistaken.
I
turned
in
my
first
paper
and
had
it
handed
back
to
me
with
a
C+
and
a
page
of
comments
listing
everything
that
should
have
been
done
differently.
Following
the
comments
was
a
suggestion
that
I
rewrite
the
paper,
which
I
did,
and
changed
my
grade
to
a
B-.
This
whole
idea
of
having
to
write
papers
over
was
not
one
that
I
particularly
cared
for,
but
it
was
something
that
I
had
to
get
used
to.
I
rewrote
a
few
papers
for
this
class,
not
necessarily
because
I
had
to,
but
because
I
knew
I
would
end
up
with
a
better
paper
if
I
did.
The
following
year
I
had
to
take
my
VaST
class.
I
did
not
get
the
one
I
wanted,
and
I
was
not
to
fond
of
the
topic
of
the
one
I
did
get
into.
I
automatically
thought
this
meant
I
would
do
poorly
because
I
would
not
be
writing
about
anything
I
was
interested
in.
The
class
turned
out
to
be
much
more
interesting
than
I
had
anticipated,
and
I
did
very
well.
The
experience
taught
me
not
to
jump
to
conclusions
about
the
topics
that
you
have
to
write
about.
I
just
looked
at
the
topics
from
a
different
viewpoint,
and
the
professor
acknowledged
my
creativity
and
courage
for
looking
at
things
in
a
different
matter.
I
think
that
professors
are
more
lenient
in
that
respect
than
the
teachers
were
in
high
school.
A
big
difference
between
high
school
and
college
writing
was
that
in
high
school
the
first
draft
could
be
hand
written,
and
only
the
final
draft
would
have
to
be
typed.
In
college,
however,
both
the
first
and
final
drafts
have
to
be
typed.
I
do
not
have
the
best
typing
skills,
so
this
was
something
that
I
had
to
get
used
to.
I
also
had
to
allow
myself
extra
time
to
type
the
first
draft
because
I
type
much
slower
than
I
write.
I
have
written
many
papers
since
I
entered
Lafayette
and
I
find
that
with
each
one
I
learn
something
to
make
the
next
one
better.
I
have
also
learned
that
I
write
much
better
when
writing
on
a
topic
that
I
find
interesting
or
enjoy.
I
have
become
fonder
of
research
papers
since
the
first
time
I
wrote
one,
and
I
prefer
them
to
creative
writing.
Each
writing
experience
I
have
shapes
me
into
the
writer
I
am,
and
the
writer
I
will
be
in
the
future.
