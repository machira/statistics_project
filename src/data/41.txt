Writing
Associate
My
Literacy
Narrative
My
memories
of
my
very
first
experiences
as
a
writer
are
not
especially
vivid.
The
first
pieces
of
writing
I
did
were
exceptional
only
to
my
parents.
They
were
the
proud
recipients
of
my
earliest
attempts
at
prose
-
heartfelt
but
hardly
eloquent
pronouncements
of
love
and
gratitude,
scrawled
carefully
into
brightly
colored
construction-papered
greeting
cards.
The
second
grade
I
remember
because
I
began
to
write
those
infamous
reports.
A
report,
of
course,
was
a
major
deal.
I
had
to
walk
to
the
neighborhood
library
and
select
the
perfect
resource
material
-
my
personal
favorite
was
the
World
Book
Encyclopedia.
I
would
read
the
dry,
flavorless
blurb
and
paraphrase
the
information,
injecting
my
own
personal
writing
flair,
into
a
similarly
dull
and
lifeless
one
page
regurgitation
on
such
topics
as
the
Sphinx,
ancient
Greece,
or
even
(and
isn't
this
one
thought-provoking)
the
Capitol
building.
This
writing
procedures
remained
pretty
constant
for
the
next
few
years,
as
my
Catholic
school
English
classes
continued
to
emphasize
grammar
and
punctuation,
including
the
ability
to
diagram
even
the
most
complex
sentence
in
our
sleep.
My
skills
improved
in
that
my
writings
contained
fewer
errors
every
year,
but
as
to
their
depth
or
creativity
-
they
were
less
than
stellar.
I
bought
a
diary
in
an
effort
to
record
my
most
personal
thoughts,
but
all
I
wrote
was
what
I
did
each
day,
instead
of
what
I
was
feeling.
Fifth
grade
arrived
and
suddenly,
I
learned
about
poetry.
Sure,
I
had
not
been
so
sheltered
as
to
never
have
read
a
poem
-
I
memorized
The
Children's
Hour
and
The
Owl
and
the
Pussycat
just
like
any
normal
kid
-
but
I'd
never
written
my
own.
I
began
to
write
everything
in
the
form
of
a
poem,
which
of
course
had
to
rhyme
-
didn't
all
poems?
One
day
the
whole
grade,
all
125
of
us,
were
told
to
write
a
poem
about
school.
My
poem
was
selected
by
the
teachers
-
my
catchy
rhyme
scheme
caught
their
attention
and
made
me
the
Winner
of
the
Fifth
Grade
Poetry
Contest.
This
poem
became
my
very
first
published
work.
Even
then,
I
realized
how
much
you
become
vulnerable
to
criticism
when
you
allow
others
to
read
your
writing
when
I
was
teased
by
a
few
fifth
grade
literary
critics.
This
little
contest
filled
me
with
confidence
about
my
writing
ability.
I
began
to
write
poems
constantly,
even
enrolling
in
poetry
workshops.
I
was
extremely
talented
for
a
ten-year-old,
yet
my
poetic
ability
didn't
seem
to
progress
as
much
as
was
expected:
once
I
learned
that
more
advanced,
deep
poems
were
usually
without
a
catchy
rhyme
scheme
and
were
often
symbolic
and
insightful,
I
abandoned
my
passion.
My
works
seemed
so
simple
and
childlike;
I
believed
that
others
were
more
capable
and
would
always
outshine
me.
I
was
too
embarrassed
to
try
to
write
more
like
them
because
I
feared
that
I
would
fail
and
make
a
fool
of
myself.
I
still
wanted
others
to
read
my
writings
and
hear
what
I
had
to
say,
so
I
became
a
journalist.
In
sixth
through
twelfth
grade,
I
wrote
articles
for
the
school
newspaper.
Not
exactly
Newsweek,
but
I
enjoyed
it
and
found
it
fulfilling.
My
favorite
assignments
were
editorials,
as
I
cannot
seem
to
stop
expressing
my
opinions.
The
newspaper
provided
an
outlet
for
this
outspokenness.
I
did,
however,
feel
quite
frustrated
at
times
due
my
school's
censorship
policy,
which
refused
to
print
any
opinion
not
supporting
the
school
or
the
Catholic
Church
entirely.
As
a
pro-choice
feminist
in
support
of
gay
rights,
I
found
this
policy
to
limit
the
possibilities
for
subject
matter
of
my
editorials
tremendously.
My
sophomore
year
in
high
school
was
about
the
time
that
I
began
to
use
a
work
processor
-
I
believe
a
Work
Processing
program
on
an
Apple
computer
-
and
grew
to
depend
on
it
for
assignments.
That
year
also
brought
a
focus
on
the
good
ol'
five
paragraph
essay,
complete
with
triangles
and
squares.
I
coasted
through
this
class,
remembering
to
follow
this
formula
always
and
believing
that
I
was
a
good
writer.
SURPRISE!
I
wasn't.
Junior
year
brought
Honors
English
and
a
whole
new
set
of
challenges.
My
teacher,
Ms.
Kaporche,
pushed
me
to
improve.
She
never
said
anything
verbally,
I
just
read
her
comments
and
tried
to
succeed
in
whatever
had
failed
me
in
the
previous
work.
But
my
classmates
were
the
ones
who
truly
motivated
me
the
most.
Every
assignment,
Ms.
Kaporche
asked
those
receiving
A+'s
to
read
their
writing.
Two
or
three
of
the
girls
often
left
me
awestruck,
while
many
others
were
still
clearly
talented.
I
realized
how
hard
I
would
have
to
work
to
produce
great
writing.
I
became
acquainted
with
Peer
Review
and
multiple
drafts.
By
the
end
of
that
year
I
had
produced
a
quality
research
paper,
an
unusual
work
on
the
JFK
assassination
(old
topic,
new
twist),
and
my
favorite
piece
of
writing
:
a
strict
imitation
piece.
I
now
realize
how
much
I
progressed
in
just
a
year
because
when
I
read
my
writing
from
sophomore
year
I'm
embarrassed,
while
when
I
read
those
works
from
junior
year
I'm
impressed.
That
strict
imitation
piece
is
my
favorite
and
the
only
A+
I
ever
received
in
that
class.
The
assignment
was
to
strictly
imitate
a
work
called
Blue
Highways,
one
page
piece
of
prose
in
which
man
goes
out
to
a
totally
deserted
place,
which
is
presumably
empty
and
void
of
anything
noteworthy,
and
composes
a
list
of
all
that
is
in
fact
present.
We
were
to
imitate
both
structure
and
theme.
Many
of
my
classmates'
works
were
beautifully
written,
all
focusing
on
physical
places
just
as
the
author
did.
I
am
most
attached
to
this
piece
because
I
opted
for
creativity
by
choosing
a
non-physical
place,
a
relationship.
I
constructed
an
essay
about
an
empty
relationship
on
the
brink
of
failure
and
listed
all
that
was
present.
Senior
year
my
AP
English
instructor
was
an
elderly
nun
who
did
not
believe
in
defying
convention,
so
I
returned
to
less
creative
works.
I
did
become
fairly
proficient
in
literary
criticism,
as
we
focused
a
great
deal
in
this
area.
For
my
big
research
paper,
I
was
assigned
the
author
Robert
Browning
and
made
the
mistake
of
sticking
with
an
impossible
topic,
which
I
made
work
after
trips
to
seven
libraries
and
about
twenty-seven
headaches.
My
topic
was
Robert
Browning's
Optimistic
View
of
Death
in
His
Poem
'Prospice.'
I
graduated
feeling
well-prepared
for
the
rigors
of
college
writing.
I
placed
out
of
Freshman
English,
but
decided
to
take
one
of
the
new
First
Year
Seminars
that
were
being
tried
out.
I
remember
very
well
meeting
with
my
writing
associate
and
feeling
so
discouraged
because
I
thought
my
paper
was
great,
but
my
professor
asked
a
million
questions,
continually
pushing
me
to
dig
deeper.
I
actually
found
out
that
I
could
delve
further
into
the
subject,
and
wrote
three
very
good
papers
that
semester.
The
biggest
challenge
to
me
as
a
writer
came
in
the
first
semester
of
my
sophomore
year
when
I
enrolled
in
Advanced
Writing.
Everyone
in
the
class
seemed
so
amazing
and
I
felt
so
incredibly
average.
Our
assignments
were
much
harder
than
I
had
ever
encountered
before
-
I
literally
had
no
clue
how
to
write
the
assignments.
I
visited
that
professor
all
the
time,
trying
at
first
to
get
a
handle
on
what
to
write
to
begin
the
drafting
process,
and
later
to
decipher
her
cryptic
comments
which
left
me
clueless
and
pulling
my
hair
out.
Suddenly,
after
succeeding
my
first
year
and
receiving
mostly
all
A's
on
my
papers
-
I
had
lost
it.
There
was
no
longer
any
pride
in
the
finished
product,
no
love
of
the
language
and
the
phrases
I
had
so
carefully
constructed.
When
I
would
complete
a
paper,
even
in
my
other
classes,
I'd
reread
the
much
belabored
work
and
think....God,
this
sucks.
I
was
incredibly
frustrated
all
semester,
though
I
was
somewhat
comforted
by
my
professor's
reassurance
that
this
was
actually
a
positive
occurrence.
She
insisted
that
I
was
about
to
have
a
breakthrough
("...always
darkest
before
dawn").
She
was
right.
Even
though
my
final
paper
in
that
class
was
something
that
I
could
indeed
be
proud
of,
a
final
paper
for
another
English
class
is
what
really
made
me
feel
that
I
had
reached
a
new
level.
I
purposely
chose
to
write
on
the
most
challenging
book
that
we
had
tackled
that
semester,
in
order
to
push
myself
to
write
a
great
paper.
I
produced
an
essay
on
Sula
by
Toni
Morrison,
and
was
damn
proud
of
the
comparisons,
symbolism,
and
metaphors
I
identified
and
used
to
demonstrate
one
focus
of
the
book.
This
paper
actually
brings
little
happiness
to
mind.
I
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
on
this
essay,
yet
my
professor
told
us
the
morning
of
our
final
that
he
had
many
more
to
read
(there
were
4
0
students
in
the
class)
but
would
finish
by
five
o'clock.
I
feel
that
he
did
not
even
really
read
my
paper,
as
his
comments
suggested
a
theme
had
been
ignored
(when
in
fact
it
was
thesis).
It
is
extremely
frustrating
to
carefully
write
for
an
audience
that
then
carelessly
skims
over
that
work,
never
appreciating
the
message
which
I
so
earnestly
wanted
to
convey.
Last
year
I
tackled
a
longer,
more
comprehensive
paper
on
Alice
Walker's
works
and
am
delighted
at
the
results.
Often
I
have
had
opportunities
to
compose
important
memos
or
letters
for
my
internships
and
summer
jobs,
and
realize
that
how
important
effective
writing
really
is
once
a
person
graduates
from
the
academic
world.
My
bosses
often
ask
me
to
proofread
things
they
send
out
to
ensure
they
have
communicated
exactly
what
they
intended.
I'm
still
intimidated
every
time
I
have
to
write
a
paper,
but
now
I
try
to
approach
it
as
a
challenge,
hoping
to
reach
that
next
level.
