not

what
to
expect
from
my
second
English
course
at
Lafayette.
Over
the
spring
semester,
my
professor
wished
for
the
class
to
get
into
the
minds
of
people
whose
class,
race
and
gender
differed
-from
our
own.

the

among
all
human
beings.
Not
only
did
this
course
enlighten
and
inform
me,
it
reiterated
previous
lessons
as
well.
Just
like
Sister
Christie,
my
FYW
professor
refused
to
accept
the
use
of
being
verbs
and
the
multiple
reiteration
of
the
same
word
throughout
a
paper;
essays
were
returned
to
me
with
remarks
almost
identical

my
