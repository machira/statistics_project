Essay
8/17/01
I
Write
"I
write.
That's
my
writing
style."
With
every
word
that
I
metaphorically
adhere
to
the
page,
the
writer
within
me
shines
through.
I
do
not
want
to
write
this
way,
but
then
again,
I
do
not
not
want
to
write
this
way.
Because
if
I
were
to
try
to
define,
'this'
way,
which
I
project
as
the
definition
of
my
writing,
how
would
that
change,
justify,
or
reinforce
that
I
do
write
'this'
way.
However,
as
my
justification
flows,
its
raging
rapids
often
uncover
and
reveal
an
underground
perception
that
neither
I,
nor
anyone
else,
would
have
visualized.
And
so
I
write.
What
my
epic
monologue
may
produce
concerning
a
past
year,
I
leave
totally
up
to
force
that
drives
it.
Directing
the
force
only
as
a
single
sand
bag
attempts
to
prevent
a
flood,
my
writing
and
literary
being
are
vastly
separated
from
myself,
a
logical
thinker.
I
contend
that
literature
bases
its
beauty
on
the
many
people
that
write.
Writers
have
written
every
character,
every
point
of
view,
and
to
every
audience
a
million
times
over,
yet
each
piece
produced
contains
some
aspect
that
separates
it
from
every
other
work.
As
a
Writing
Assistant,
reading
numerous
papers
covering
varied
and
similar
topics,
I
readily
notice
the
aspects
that
separate
the
writers.
Each
writer
brings
new
emotion,
a
different
feeling,
and
an
entirely
unique
perspective
to
the
writing
table.
These
individual
characteristics
make
the
position
of
a
WA
that
much
more
intense.
Working
with
each
student
presents
it
own
challenges,
its
own
rewards,
but
also
its
disappointments.
Working
through
all
of
these
outcomes
makes
a
meeting
productive;
productive
for
you,
the
reader;
for
me,
the
WA;
and
for
who
ever
wrote
the
piece.
With
a
year
behind
me,
in
an
attempt
to
form
a
better
understanding
and
awareness
of
the
program
that
I
actively
participate
in,
I
feel
that
I
have
gained
an
invaluable
amount
of
knowledge.
I
feel
that
one
of
the
greatest
victories
in
life
is
the
art
of
human
interaction.
Successful
human
interaction.
If
one
can
find
a
way
to
sympathize,
or
even
better
to
understand
how
another
person
feels,
such
a
quality
is
the
first
step
to
any
form
of
interaction.
As
a
second-year
WA,
I
can
attest
that
that
quality
has
improved
within
me.
Fascinated
with
people
and
how
each
individual
thinks,
I
run
into
many
instances
where
all
a
writer
needed
was
some
assistance
in
adapting
the
way
the
he
thinks
to
a
manner
that
the
assignment
accepts.
Although
each
situation
is
entirely
unique,
I
have
found
that
talking
out-loud
helps
to
route
even
the
most
complicated
thoughts
to
a
more
simple
and
manageable
form,
for
most
people.
Hearing
themselves
talk
about
an
issue,
many
students
find
that
their
intuitive
organization
and
explanation
are
the
best
directions
to
aim
a
work.
Just
provoking
students
to
realize
this
for
themselves
helps
a
student
grow
in
many
avenues.
The
process
of
legitimately
interacting
with
the
students
during
conferences,
although
the
most
successful
tactic,
also
proved
to
cause
the
mostly
difficulty.
Many
writers,
and
I
am
no
different,
find
it
very
difficult
to
fully
analyze
and
discuss
their
own
works
openly.
I
find
that
many
students
tend
to
become
defense
when
a
question
arises
concerning
the
meaning
of
a
passage
or
approach
that
he
or
she
used
in
the
piece.
These
insecure
feelings
make
students
shut
the
gates
of
communication,
one
of
the
worse
dynamics
for
peer
writing
conference.
Dealing
with
a
student
who
will
not
add
any
more
than
an
occasion,
"Yes",
"No",
"Ummhmm",
and
an
"I
understand",
is
my
greatest
difficulty
as
a
WA.
However,
the
majority
of
my
hardships
do
not
arise
from
actually
conducting
this
sort
of
conference,
but
rather
from
what
both
the
student
and
I
gain
from
having
such
a
conference.
With
an
unresponsive
student,
many
of
the
provoking
questions
I
ask
end
abruptly,
with
no
conclusions.
All
of
the
thought
that
I
have
put
into
understanding
the
paper
and
the
writer
disintegrate,
as
the
composer
watches
the
clock
tick
away
the
allotted
time.
Becoming
motivated
yourself
and
finding
a
way
to
make
others
interested
and
excited
are
the
two
most
important
ways
that
I
have
found
to
enflame
a
dwindling
conference.
Looking
to
my
own
experiences
and
writing
for
possible
tactics
that
may
excite
motivation
in
an
assignment
or
in
a
topic,
I
often
strive
for
narrowing
my
scope.
In
every
assignment
and
in
every
subject
there
always
exists
some
aspect
that
will
interest
the
writer.
Finding
this
inspiration,
however,
causes
a
lot
of
difficulty
for
many
students.
I
have
found
many
students
working
directly
from
an
assignment
sheet,
word
for
word,
line
for
line.
Although
organization
is
an
important
part
of
writing,
I
have
found
it
best
for
individuals
to
find
their
own
ways
to
join
certain
concepts
and
arguments.
Working
with
the
students
to
find
themselves
in
the
piece,
instead
of
writing
for
someone
else,
I
have
found
dramatic
improvements
from
draft
to
draft.
When
a
student
finds
a
reason
and
a
desire
to
write,
not
only
does
the
quality
of
the
work
increase,
but
usually
the
student's
awareness
of
the
assignment
and
aspiration
for
peer
interaction
and
improvement
also
increases.
As
a
second-year
WA
my
main
goal
has
transformed
from
fixing
writing,
to
helping
others
become
more
confident,
insightful,
and
informed
thinkers
and
creators.
There
is
nothing
more
rewarding
than
participating
in
a
conference
that
does
not
end
when
the
writer
walks
out
the
door.
When
every
suggestion
you,
as
a
WA,
make
and
every
insight
the
writer
add
pushes
you
to
reassess
who
you
are
as
a
thinker
or
how
your
mind
works
as
a
writer,
you
know
you
have
just
participated
in
a
enriching
conference.
Do
you
return
to
the
grammar
book,
even
when
incorrect
usage
provides
an
incredible
flow
throughout
the
pieces
to
just
read?
Do
you
suggest
a
complete
overhaul
to
the
writer
that
approaches
the
essay
from
the
conclusion
to
the
introduction,
rather
than
vice-versa?
Or
do
you
criticize
yourself,
the
WA,
for
believing
that
you
could
classify
and
understand
every
writing
approach
with
such
minimal
knowledge?
For
a
select
number
of
conferences
these
questions
have
more
than
passed
through
my
mind.
From
these
conferences
alone,
I
feel
that
I
have
a
greater
acceptance
for
different
styles
of
writing
than
I
previously
had
had.
Even
though
I
have
been
exposed
to
a
fair
amount
of
genres,
styles,
and
techniques,
writing
would
lose
its
beauty
if
we,
as
readers,
did
not
come
across
styles
that
totally
challenge
what
we
have
previously
seen.
One
of
the
most
rewarding
qualities
of
the
writing
program
is
its
ability
to
act
as
a
bi-directional
learning
platform.
One
would
be
a
fool
to
say
that
the
writing
program
is
only
for
the
participating
students,
and
that
Writing
Assistants
act
solely
as
mediators
to
assist
these
writers.
We
are
all
writers,
thinkers,
and
composers.
I
have
found
that
with
each
set
of
conferences,
for
every
concept
that
I
review
with
the
students
I
find
myself
working
the
same
tactics
in
my
own
writing.
Every
style
I
see
effectively
proving
an
argument,
I
often
evaluate
its
use
for
my
next
work.
For
every
clarity
issue
I
contest
within
a
student's
work,
the
example
makes
me
more
aware
of
the
purpose
for
such
uses
in
my
own
work.
That
is
why
the
Writing
Program
has
been
so
effective
for
me,
as
I
would
suggest
for
many
other
WAs
as
well.
As
a
writer
I
can
feel
that
I
have
a
good
understanding
of
what
it
takes
to
produce
a
clear
concise
work,
however,
if
I
never
put
any
of
that
knowledge
to
the
test,
how
would
I
ever
know.
Just
adding
explanations
of
structural
or
organization
issue
throughout
conferences
helps
me
to
see
how
the
intricacies
of
writing
are
what
make
it
so
powerful.
My
only
disappoint
as
a
WA
in
the
writing
program
and
an
engineer
the
realm
of
college
academia
rests
in
my
inability
to
readily
utilize
all
the
writing
exposure
that
I
experience.
Recalling
the
last
time
I
was
assigned
to
write
an
essay,
a
creative
work,
or
anything
that
I
did
not
have
to
squeeze
into
the
shell
of
a
lab
report'
I
find
myself
back
in
FYS,
freshman
year.
Directly
out
of
high
school,
I
had
become
familiar
with
and
fond
of
such
writing.
Understanding
that
my
major
selection
would
steer
me
away
from
this
path,
which
I
had
centered
my
high
school
years
around,
I
choose
to
participate
in
the
writing
program
as
a
means
of
helping
me
to
remain
connected
with
the
literary
aspect
of
life
(A
formality
that
I
have
found
to
escape
the
requirements
for
a
typical
engineer).
The
Writing
Program
has
done
just
that,
helped
to
keep
me
in
constant
awareness
of
literature
and
its
importance
in
our
everyday
workings.
Without
specifically
setting
apart
time
for
all
aspects
of
writing,
as
required
within
the
program,
I
feel
that
my
writing
would
have
dwindled
solely
to
my
ever-diminishing
free
time,
which
I
take
to
sit
down
and
write.
I
face
my
real
dilemma
unconsciously,
however.
Through
every
staff
meeting,
during
every
conference,
within
every
conversation
I
feel
that
I
gain
a
better
understanding
of
what
makes
a
thinker
more
insightful,
a
creator
more
creative,
and
a
writer
more
effect.
It
appears,
because
I
do
have
the
opportunity
and
necessity
to
write
as
much,
some
of
this
information
can
not
fully
solidify
within
me,
as
a
writer.
Working
and
conferencing
with
other
students
helps
tremendously,
however,
it
is
hard
to
tell
how
much
a
person
truly
understands,
until
he
tries
it
out
for
himself.
It
is
for
that
reason
that
I
find
myself
participating
in
many
of
the
opportunities
available
for
me
as
Writing
Associate.
With
each
new
experience,
with
each
increased
interaction,
I
strive
to
solidly
all
that
I
have
learned,
to
the
further
improve
myself
as
a
writer
and
thinker,
to
better
aid
the
program.
And
I
can
only
hope
that
my
lack
of
opportunity
in
my
normal
course
load
will
not
prevent
me
from
reaching
this
goal
of
a
higher
standard.
As
every
conference
ends,
I
envy
the
writer.
I
envy
the
writer
for
having
the
opportunity
to
write
and
to
add
to
the
ever-defining
qualities
of
literature.
The
amazing
aspect
of
the
program
is
that
I
can
never
find
myself
at
a
loss.
Because
writing
is
such
a
dynamic
art,
every
time
I
sit
down
to
read,
to
compose,
to
analyze,
or
to
think
whether
it
be
during
a
conference,
preparing
for
a
conference,
or
after
a
conference
I
am
constantly
bombarded
with
unique
perceptions.
Every
student's
personality
and
the
interaction
between
him,
his
work,
and
myself
all
add
an
aspect
to
my
writing
that
I
could
hardly
hope
to
specify.
Even
comparing
my
writing
now
to
my
works
of
the
past,
or
even
those
of
the
future,
one
may
not
be
able
to
differentiate
between
them.
However,
even
if
they
are
the
similar,
they
are
similar
for
different
reasons.
And
even
though
the
Writing
Program
has
helped
me
define
who
I
am
as
I
writer,
I
don't
think
I
will
ever
reach
a
plateau,
where
I
would
reach
a
leveling
of
my
personal
literary
exploration,
nor
would
I
ever
want
to.
And
so
I
write
and
on
the
outside,
that's
plain
and
simply
my
writing
style.
