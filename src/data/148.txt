August
28,
1998
Like
most
children,
my
first
words
were
"Ma-Ma"
and
"Da-Da."
By
the
age
of
three,
when
I
entered
nursery
school,
I
had
learned
more
difficult
and
interesting
words
like
"pasgetti"
and
"hopsital."
I
discovered
that
words
opened
the
doors
to
wonderful
new
worlds,
and
so
began
my
love
affair
with
words,
one
that
persists
to
this
day.
And
so
I
practiced
this
new
art
endlessly.
But
talking
24
hours
a
day,
7
days
a
week
was
not
enough
for
me
(but
certainly
more
than
enough
for
my
parents).
I
desperately
wanted
to
read
and
write.
My
parents,
elated
that
I
was
interested
in
books
at
such
a
young
age,
subscribed
to
the
"Weekly
Readers
Book
Club."
Throughout
the
next
year,
I
acquired
every
Dr.
Suess
and
Pickles
book
on
the
market.
I
was
a
prodigy
child
-1
could
read
at
the
age
of
three.
That
is
not
quite
the
way
my
parents
tell
the
story,
but
undoubtedly
my
memory
is
superior
to
theirs.
My
mom
read
The
Foot
Book
to
me
every
night,
three
times
a
night,
before
I
went
to
bed.
Not
by
her
choice,
of
course.
By
the
end
of
a
month
I
had
the
book
memorized
and
I
"read"
it
to
anyone
and
everyone
who
would
listen,
as
well
as
to
many
who
chose
not
to
listen.
But
as
my
fascination
with
language
continued,
I
grew
bored
with
simply
reading
others'
words.
I
wanted
to
create
my
own.
And
so
began
my
lifelong
journey
into
the
world
of
writing.
Equipped
with
my
first
box
of
oversized
Crayolas
and
my
Smurf
notepad,
I
slowly
and
diligently
learned
how
to
write
the
letters
of
the
alphabet.
It
wasn't
an
easy
process.
Sometimes
my
B's
and
D's
ended
up
in
a
position
other
than
their
natural
one.
My
S's
looked
like
2's.
Being
the
persistent
child
that
I
was,
I
did
not
give
up
and
was
soon
ready
for
my
next
challenge
-
writing
my
name.
Although
my
name
was
long,
I
quickly
realized
it
was
actually
quite
easy
to
write.
In
my
name
I
had
two
A's,
two
S's,
and
a
scattering
of
several
other
easy
letters.
I
practiced
writing
my
name
with
every
color
crayon
in
the
box,
and
wrote
it
on
anything
that
I
thought
could
benefit
from
my
personalization
(including
newspapers,
magazines,
and
walls).
After
conquering
the
formidable
task
of
writing
my
first
name,
I
easily
moved
on
to
include
my
middle
and
last
names.
No
longer
was
my
name
just
Larissa,
but
Nicole
Dodson.
My
parents,
tired
of
cleaning
errant
pencil
marks
and
fluorescent
letter
fragments
off
the
wall,
decided
to
turn
my
interests
toward
outside
activities
(where
I
couldn't
destroy
anything).
My
attention
turned
from
crayons
and
books
to
swimming
and
playing
in
the
sandbox.
My
first
writing
experience
had
ended
and
I
had
no
idea
what
impact
it
would
make
on
the
rest
of
my
life.
During
the
next
two
years,
before
I
went
to
kindergarten,
I
continued
to
color
and
constantly
asked
how
to
spell
new
words.
By
the
time
I
entered
kindergarten,
I
could
write
my
name,
my
address,
my
telephone
number
and,
most
importantly,
the
name
of
my
dog,
Tucker.
Kindergarten
was
definitely
a
learning
experience.
One
of
my
first
assignments
was
a
cut,
paste,
and
color
activity.
I
sloppily
cut
the
pictures
out,
colored
them
hastily,
and
pasted
them
on
their
matching
counterparts.
I
was
so
proud
of
myself
because
I
was
the
first
one
in
the
class
to
finish
the
project.
I
handed
in
my
paper
with
a
broad
smile
and
excited
expectations
of
receiving
my
paper
back
the
next
day
with
a
sticker
and
a
big
red
star.
The
next
day,
to
my
dismay,
the
paper
was
returned
with
a
sad
face
and
a
comment
that
read
something
like
"Sloppy
coloring.
You
need
to
stay
in
the
lines.
Haste
makes
waste."
I
didn't
know
every
word
old
Mrs.
Moyer
had
written,
but
I
knew
it
wasn't
good.
I
took
the
paper
home
to
my
mom,
and
asked
her
what
it
said.
She
read
the
comment
to
me
and
tried
to
explain
to
me
that
just
because
I
was
the
first
one
finished
didn't
mean
I
was
the
best
one.
Being
the
best
meant
taking
your
time
and
being
very
careful.
The
lesson
that
Mrs.
Moyer
instilled
in
me
that
day
has
stayed
with
me
throughout
my
life
and
has
played
a
large
role
in
every
task
I
have
taken
on,
especially
writing.
In
second
grade,
my
reading
teacher,
Mrs.
Hendricks,
had
an
important
influence
on
my
life.
It
was
a
week
or
two
before
the
end
of
the
school
year.
It
was
warm
and
sunny
and
the
playground,
looming
large
right
outside
the
classroom
window,
beckoned.
It
took
all
the
skill
and
energy
that
Mrs.
Hendricks
had
to
keep
us
focused
during
reading
class.
I
guess
she
decided
that
if
we
had
an
assignment
to
keep
us
busy,
our
minds
wouldn't
stray
to
thoughts
of
the
jungle
gym
and
four
square.
Our
in-class
assignment
was
to
make
up
a
story.
Plain
and
simple
-
it
could
be
about
anything.
Mrs.
Hendricks
didn't
give
us
any
example
stories
or
ideas,
just
the
instructions
of
"Write".
All
my
friends
started
writing
furiously
while
I
sat
there
and
looked
around
the
room,
wondering
what
to
write.
I
sat
there
and
sat
there
and
before
I
had
even
written
my
name
on
my
paper,
time
was
up.
Mrs.
Hendricks
then
decided
that
each
student
would
read
his/her
story
to
the
class.
Immediately,
twenty-seven
eager
hands
were
raised
high
in
the
air,
waving
back
and
forth,
as
children
began
getting
up
on
their
knees
on
the
desk
chair
in
the
hope
that
they
would
be
chosen
first.
The
twenty-eighth
student,
staring
at
a
blank
piece
of
paper,
sat
still
and
quiet,
silently
praying
for
invisibility.
My
best
friend
Sabrina
was
the
first
student
Mrs.
Hendricks
called
upon.
Sabrina
excitedly
read
her
story
of
a
princess
named
"Sabrina"
who
was
being
chased
into
the
woods
by
an
evil
tiger.
The
tiger
promised
he
would
not
eat
her
if
she
would
give
him
her
lucky
rabbit's
foot.
The
story
ended
happily
ever
after
as
her
best
friend
jumped
out
of
a
tree
and
put
the
tiger
into
a
trance
by
dancing.
After
hearing
the
story,
I
had
many
mixed
feelings.
I
felt
special
that
Sabrina
had
written
about
me
in
her
story,
but
at
the
same
time
I
was
angry
with
myself
for
not
being
so
creative,
and
I
was
most
definitely
mad
at
Mrs.
Hendricks
for
giving
out
such
a
"stupid"
assignment
and
making
me
feel
so
incompetent.
When
class
was
over
Mrs.
Hendricks
called
me
up
to
her
desk.
She
knew
I
had
not
written
a
story
and
told
me
to
complete
the
assignment
at
home
and
hand
it
in
the
next
day.
I
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
trying
to
decide
what
to
write
about,
with
no
success.
I
went
home
and
told
my
mom
what
my
assignment
was.
She
said
"Oh,
that
sounds
like
fun.
What
are
you
going
to
write
about?"
I
started
to
cry,
ran
upstairs
to
my
room,
and
slammed
the
door.
My
mom
hurried
up
after
me,
knocked
on
my
door,
and
asked
if
she
could
come
in.
She
asked
me
what
was
wrong
and
I
told
her
"I
have
nothing
to
write
about."
She
said,
"Of
course
you
do.
Think
about
all
the
things
you
like
to
do
and
then
write
a
story
about
all
of
them."
I
thought
about
it
for
a
minute
and
said
"Okay."
My
mom
went
back
downstairs
to
cook
dinner
and
told
me
to
come
down
when
I
was
finished.
An
hour
later
I
came
downstairs
with
two
pieces
of
paper.
I
proudly
read
my
story
about
a
magical
zoo
with
unicorns
and
dragons.
One
could
only
get
to
this
zoo
by
swimming
across
the
ocean
at
night.
I
took
my
story
in
to
Mrs.
Hendricks
the
next
day.
She
read
it
and
handed
it
back
with
a
star
and
a
sticker.
I
was
proud
of
myself
for
writing
my
story,
but
I
decided
I
never
wanted
to
write
a
story
again
unless
someone
told
me
what
to
write
about.
Little
did
I
know
that
day
what
an
important
lesson
I
had
learned
about
myself,
and
how
the
path
I
would
follow
for
the
rest
of
my
life
was
given
some
minute
direction
by
this
one
"simple"
assignment
I
had
been
given.
The
years
passed
and
writing
became
second
nature.
It
was
something
I
did
so
often
that
I
never
really
thought
about
it
before
I
did
it.
I
wrote
out
my
homework,
I
wrote
notes
during
class
to
all
my
friends,
and
I
wrote
to
my
Aunt
Jill
out
in
Colorado.
Writing
was
like
talking.
I
did
it
anytime
and
all
the
time
to
anybody.
I
liked
writing
when
it
wasn't
something
I
was
told
to
do.
And
then,
in
tenth
grade,
came
my
first
explication
paper.
I
looked
at
my
teacher
like
he
had
six
heads
and
no
arms
when
he
told
us
what
we
were
going
to
write.
I
had
never
heard
the
word
"explication"
so
how
could
I
write
a
paper
like
that?
The
class
was
going
to
read
"A
Separate
Peace"
and
we
each
had
to
write
an
8-10
page
paper
analyzing
the
underlying
meanings
in
the
book.
We
covered
the
book
in
detail
and
analyzed
it
as
a
class,
but
writing
the
paper
was
an
individual
assignment.
It
didn't
seem
like
it
was
going
to
be
too
terribly
difficult.
After
all,
at
least
I
knew
what
I
was
supposed
to
be
writing
about.
Then
I
read
the
requirements:
a
minimum
of
25
notecards
with
quotes
from
the
book
to
be
used
as
supportive
details
for
my
hypothesis;
a
five-page
outline
of
the
topics
and
subjects
I
was
going
to
cover
in
my
paper;
and
my
final
paper
with
endnotes
and
a
bibliography.
I
was
ready
to
cry.
I
didn't
have
an
"English/Liberal
Arts"
brain,
I
had
a
"Science/Math"
brain.
I
shouldn't
have
to
do
this.
I
didn't
need
to
know
how
to
write
an
explication
paper
if
I
was
going
to
be
doing
chemistry
and
algebra
the
rest
of
my
life.
Unfortunately,
the
school
and
my
English
teacher
didn't
agree
with
me.
So
I
went
about
the
long
and
detailed
process
of
writing
this
paper.
After
each
step
of
the
process,
literary
genius
Mr.
Stoneback
would
hand
it
back,
covered
with
comments
in
red
marker,
and
I
would
dutifully
make
the
necessary
changes.
When
it
was
finally
time
to
write
the
paper
I
was
overjoyed.
I
could
now
expend
my
efforts
in
some
worthwhile
activity,
like
discovering
what
happens
when
you
mix
nitrogen
with
sulfuric
acid.
Everything
I
had
handed
in
had
already
been
corrected
by
the
genius,
so
how
could
I
go
wrong?
If
I
followed
his
suggestions,
it
was
sure
to
be
an
"A"
paper.
I
wrote
the
paper
in
three
hours,
checked
for
spelling
mistakes,
and
handed
it
in.
Two
weeks
later,
when
the
paper
was
returned,
I
was
stunned
and
disappointed.
I
had
received
a
76
on
my
paper.
I
couldn't
believe
it.
I
always
got
an
"A"
on
everything.
How
could
I
have
earned
a
"C"?
I
was
too
intimidated
by
Mr.
Stoneback,
at
6'4"
and
250
pounds,
to
dare
question
him,
so
I
was
left
with
only
one
alternative
to
satisfy
my
perfectionist
tendencies.
I
vowed
I
would
do
better
next
time.
I
was
privileged
to
have
Mr.
Stoneback
as
an
English
teacher
throughout
the
rest
of
high
school.
During
that
time,
I
wrote
six
more
explication
papers.
My
grades
slowly
improved,
but
I
still
didn't
enjoy
writing
and
I
still
didn't
understand
why
I
had
to
write
if
I
was
going
to
major
in
Chemical
Engineering
in
college.
Now
I
am
a
senior
in
college.
I
am
at
the
point
in
my
life
when
I
have
to
start
interviewing
and
sending
out
resumes.
I
cross
my
fingers
and
pray
that
I
will
find
a
job.
And
then
I
think,
"I've
done
pretty
well
in
college.
I
have
a
good
personality,
and
I'm
a
hard
worker."
But,
apparently,
one
of
my
most
important
strengths
is
that
I
know
how
to
communicate
well
with
others
-
not
only
verbally,
but
also
through
writing.
I
have
interned
the
past
two
years
with
a
company
that
has
allowed
me
to
practice
all
my
chemical
engineering
skills,
but
my
employer
has
been
most
impressed
with
my
ability
to
write.
I
worked
this
summer
writing
technical
documents
and
guidelines.
The
subject
matter
was
very
specific
to
chemical
engineers,
but
needed
to
be
written
in
a
manner
so
that
anyone
who
read
the
document
could
understand
it
and
apply
it.
So
after
six
years,
I
have
finally
figured
out
why
a
Chemical
Engineer
needs
to
know
how
to
write!
I
was
writing
an
FRS
for
a
client
when
I
hit
a
mind
block.
I
couldn't
figure
out
how
to
word
the
next
sentence.
I
wrote
it
five
different
ways
and
deleted
them
all.
I
started
to
reminisce
about
all
the
times
I
had
written
stories,
notes,
letters,
essays,
papers,
etc.,
and
how
many
times
I
had
encountered
this
dilemma
of
choosing
just
the
right
words,
in
just
the
right
combination,
to
express
my
thoughts.
I
began
to
think
about
whom
it
was
that
actually
taught
me
how
to
write,
and
I
realized
it
wasn't
one
person.
It
started
with
my
parents
who
gave
me
my
first
crayon
and
had
the
willingness
and
the
patience
to
teach
me
the
letters
of
the
alphabet.
It
was
Mrs.
Moyer
who
taught
me
to
take
my
time
and
concentrate
on
quality,
not
quantity.
It
was
Mrs.
Hendricks
who
taught
me
to
be
creative
and
apply
what
I
already
know
and
understand
to
my
writing.
It
was
Mr.
Stoneback
who
taught
me
to
be
attentive
to
details
and
to
always
have
supporting
evidence
in
asserting
an
opinion.
It
was
college
that
allowed
me
to
practice
the
skills
I
had
learned.
So,
as
I
become
a
writing
associate,
I
realize
that
writing
is
one
of
the
most
important
skills
to
possess,
and
I
thank
all
those
who
made
an
impact
on
my
life
(whether
I
knew
it
then
or
not).
I
hope
that
as
a
writing
associate
I
can
affect
other
students'
lives
in
a
positive
and
inspirational
way
as
my
teachers
and
mentors
have
done
for
me.
