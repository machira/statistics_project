I
did
not
discover
my
passion
for
writing
until
I
began
high
school.
Before
high
school
there
were
always
small
indications
that
I
would
later
excel
in
writing.
In
elementary
school
I
developed
a
fascination
for
detective
novels,
so
I
decided
to
write
one,
placing
myself
as
the
main
character.
Whenever
my
friends
would
go
to
summer
sleep
away
camps,
I
would
mail
them
weekly
hand
written
letters,
pouring
the
latest
events
in
my
life
out
to
them
on
pages
and
pages
of
stationary.
Upon
being
asked
to
write
the
ending
of
a
short
story
in
a
sixth
grade
writing
exercise,
my
ending
was
longer
than
the
original
short
story.
I
have
always
been
able
to
accurately
express
my
thoughts
through
writing.
However,
it
was
not
until
high
school
that
I
realized
not
only
how
much
I
enjoyed
writing,
but
also
the
power
I
held
as
a
strong
writer.
The
first
time
I
remember
being
challenged
as
a
writer
was
in
my
tenth
grade
English
class.
Until
then
I
always
remember
getting
an
easy
NAO
in
my
English
classes.
However,
that
year,
I
was
met
with
the
same
unsatisfying
mark
at
the
top
of
each
of
my
essays;
NB+/A-.O
Now,
this
is
not
the
usual
story
of
a
student
so
overcome
with
determination
at
the
sight
of
an
unexpected
grade
that
she
works
night
and
day
on
her
next
essay
in
order
to
yield
astounding
improvements.
This
is
the
story
of
how
I
had
to
think
outside
of
the
box
in
order
to
get
what
I
wanted.
It
was
the
beginning
of
one
of
my
tenth
grade
English
classes.
My
teacher
was
about
to
dive
right
into
Beowulf
when
I
raised
my
hand.
NSir,
is
there
anyway
I
can
boost
my
grade?O
I
said.
My
teacher,
notorious
for
refusing
to
accept
any
form
of
extra
credit,
replied
with
a
smirk
and
a
sarcastic
comment,
NSure,
Liane,
build
me
a
time
machine
and
I
will
give
you
extra
credit.O
I
guess
he
thought
that
his
mocking
reply
would
dissuade
me
from
pursuing
any
further
hopes
of
extra
credit.
He
could
not
have
been
more
wrong.
As
he
began
to
explain
the
blood
feud
between
Beowulf
and
Grendel
that
day,
I
began
hatching
a
plan.
That
night
I
went
home
and
took
a
large
box
out
of
my
garage
which
had
once
housed
my
refrigerator.
I
cut
three
lines
in
the
front,
creating
a
door,
then
proceeded
to
wrap
the
entire
box
in
tin
foil.
I
then
wrote
NTime
MachineO
on
the
front,
and
for
the
finishing
touches
I
put
a
knob
on
the
back
of
the
structure
which
could
be
switched
from
Npast,O
Npresent,O
or
Nfuture.O
The
time
machine
was
done,
but
something
was
still
missing.
Though
the
machine
looked
impressive,
I
still
needed
to
prove
myself
as
a
writer.
I
wrote
my
teacher
a
letter,
explaining
that
I
was
sending
him
the
time
machine,
as
he
would
need
to
use
it
to
complete
his
mission.
His
mission,
I
wrote,
was
to
go
back
in
time
and
help
Beowulf
defeat
Grendel.
As
proof
of
the
roll
he
was
destined
to
play
in
the
epic
poem,
I
wrote
a
creative
piece,
inserting
my
teacher
into
the
Beowulf
story.
I
got
a
janitor
to
unlock
my
teacherOs
office
early
one
morning,
and
I
left
the
time
machine,
the
letter,
and
the
invented
piece
of
Beowulf
history
in
his
office
for
him
to
find.
Later
that
day
in
class
my
teacher
congratulated
me
in
my
success
on
the
creative
project,
and
proceeded
to
inform
me
that
I
would
not
be
receiving
any
extra
credit
because
my
time
machine
was
not
actually
able
to
transport
him
back
in
time.
However,
I
never
received
another
disappointing
grade
on
another
tenth
grade
English
paper.
This
experience
taught
me
a
few
things
about
my
writing.
First,
it
taught
me
that
although
my
abilities
as
a
speaker
had
failed
me
in
this
situation,
my
abilities
as
a
creative
writer
allowed
me
to
excel
in
this
class,
and
later
on
through
out
high
school.
The
words
I
was
able
to
write
on
paper
held
an
immense
amount
of
power,
which
helped
me
to
persuade
my
teacher
in
my
favor.
Secondly,
I
learned
that
combining
my
writing
skills
with
my
creativity
was
an
unbeatable
combination.
Not
only
did
my
creative
writing
help
to
persuade
my
teacher,
but
my
3-D
sculpture
was
a
nice
addition.
Writing
was
no
longer
enough.
Presentation
now
needed
to
be
added
into
the
equation.
Lastly,
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
I
learned
that
I
genuinely
enjoyed
writing,
especially
when
I
used
writing
as
my
primary
weapon
when
defending
myself.
This
experience
was
the
launching
point
of
my
writing
career.
I
was
not
soon
to
forget
what
I
had
learned
from
the
time
machine.
Later
that
year
I
went
to
the
same
teacherOs
office
during
a
free
period.
We
had
become
close,
and
my
appearances
in
his
office
had
become
frequent.
I
found
him
grading
an
essay.
He
had
removed
the
staple,
which
had
once
held
its
pages
together
and
was
grading
the
loose
pages.
When
I
inquired
as
to
why
he
had
done
this
and
expressed
my
concern
that
he
would
lose
the
loose
pages,
he
responded
with
three
words,
NStaples
are
Fascist.O
Of
course
this
was
a
ridiculous
statement.
Who
refuses
to
use
staples
because
they
think
that
staples
represent
imprisonment
through
collectivism?
But
I
had
learned
from
my
past
experience
that
it
would
behoove
me
to
humor
his
outrageous
requests.
My
last
essay
of
the
year
for
his
class
was
due
at
the
end
of
that
week,
and
I
had
just
a
few
days
to
figure
out
how
to
present
my
essay
void
of
staples.
I
had
to
devise
a
way
to
submit
my
paper
so
the
pages
were
still
grouped
together
to
eliminate
any
chances
of
him
losing
a
part
or
even
my
whole
paper.
The
night
before
the
paper
was
due
I
asked
my
mom
to
take
me
to
a
liquor
store.
There
we
bought
a
bottle
of
wine
and
brought
it
home.
No
one
in
my
family
drinks
liquor,
so
the
contents
of
the
bottle
were
drained
into
the
sink.
That
night
I
neatly
rolled
my
paper
into
a
tight
scroll
and
stuffed
it
into
the
bottle
so
that
about
one
fourth
of
it
still
stuck
out
of
the
bottleOs
neck.
The
next
morning
I
once
again
found
myself
asking
the
janitor
to
let
me
into
my
teacherOs
office
so
that
I
could
deliver
my
paper.
I
set
the
bottle
on
his
desk
with
a
note
that
read,
NYou
were
right,
staples
are
fascist.O
That
was
around
the
same
time
I
started
writing
poetry.
I
am
not
even
sure
that
it
could
truthfully
have
been
called
NpoetryO.
When
I
wrote
a
NpoemO
to
a
friend
it
usually
consisted
of
a
recount
of
one
of
our
ridiculous
endeavors
written
in
rhyming
couplets.
Senior
year,
my
best
friend
and
I
were
Mario
and
Luigi
for
Halloween.
Naturally
we
began
to
dispute
over
which
character
was
superior.
In
order
to
argue
my
case
I
wrote
her
a
poem
called
NWhy
Mario
is
Superior
to
Luigi.O
In
rhyming
verse
the
poem
discussed
MarioOs
various
positive
attributes
contrasted
with
LuigiOs
humiliating
flaws.
My
friend
responded
to
my
invention
by
copying
a
poem
that
she
found
from
the
Internet,
praising
LuigiOs
vast
successes.
From
this
experience
I
learned
two
more
things.
Firstly,
that
not
everyone
had
my
creative
abilities.
Many
of
my
friends
have
tried
to
replicate
my
poems,
however,
without
much
success.
Secondly
I
learned
that
my
close
friends
and
family
enjoyed
reading
my
writing,
so
much
so
that
they
considered
each
poem
somewhat
of
a
treat.
My
poems
were
valuable.
I
had
a
waiting
list
of
people
who
had
requested
that
I
write
them
a
personalized
poem.
I
realized
that
my
poems
became
so
precious
that
they
would
be
accepted
as
a
form
of
currency.
Instead
of
wasting
money
on
purchasing
material
birthday
presents,
I
began
giving
my
friends
and
family
personalized
poems
for
their
birthdays.
These
poems
proved
to
be
much
less
expensive
and
much
more
meaningful
than
most
other
gifts
that
I
had
ever
given.
However,
I
could
not
just
e-mail
these
valuable
gifts.
So
again
I
found
myself
tapping
into
my
vast
knowledge
of
creative
presentations.
I
glued
my
poems
to
construction
paper.
I
rolled
them
into
scrolls
and
tied
them
with
ribbon.
Sometimes
I
even
accompanied
them
with
hand
drawn
pictures.
Yet
after
a
while
these
lame
presentations
did
not
fully
do
justice
to
my
coveted
creations.
The
answer
to
my
presentation
dilemma
came
to
me
last
June
when
I
decided
to
substitute
a
fatherOs
day
gift
with
one
of
my
poems.
I
decided
to
humor
my
fatherOs
obsession
with
The
Lord
of
the
Rings
by
incorporating
the
novel
into
my
poem.
In
my
poem
I
would
claim
that
my
father
was
actually
leading
a
double
life;
one
of
them
as
a
normal
sales
consultant
from
New
Jersey,
and
the
other
as
Aragorn,
one
of
the
main
characters
in
The
Lord
of
the
Rings.
I
had
selected
my
topic,
but
it
still
lacked
presentation.
It
was
then
that
I
decided
to
write
the
poem
from
the
angle
that
I
was
exposing
my
fatherOs
double
life
to
the
rest
of
my
family.
After
dinner
on
fatherOs
day
I
walked
down
the
stairs
in
my
house
wearing
the
business
suit
my
mother
bought
me
for
my
internship.
In
my
right
hand
I
carried
a
suitcase.
I
stopped
in
front
of
the
dinner
table,
placed
the
suitcase
on
the
table
and
extracted
a
folder
labeled
NCLASSIFIEDO
in
red
sharpie.
Inside
of
the
folder
was
the
poem.
I
read
the
poem
aloud,
and
revealed
in
detail
how
I
had
secretly
followed
my
father
one
day
when
he
claimed
to
be
running
Nerrands.O
While
pursuing
my
father
I
claimed
that
I
observed
him
interacting
with
numerous
other
characters
from
The
Lord
of
the
Rings
and
attending
secret
discussions
regarding
the
fate
of
the
ring.
Needless
to
say
my
performance
was
unforgettable.
I
do
not
find
myself
writing
for
fun
anymore.
I
am
not
sure
exactly
why
this
is
so.
Perhaps
my
college
environment
does
not
facilitate
my
creativity
like
high
school
did.
Perhaps
I
am
not
inspired
to
impress
those
around
me
through
my
writing.
Regardless,
I
did
not
share
in
the
common
anxiety
towards
college
writing
that
most
students
feel
upon
entering
college.
My
high
school
prepared
me
well
for
college
academics;
if
anything,
I
was
challenged
more
in
high
school.
I
like
being
challenged.
It
would
be
a
lie
to
say
that
I
have
not
met
anyone
who
challenges
me
in
college.
My
current
boyfriend
challenges
me
frequently.
Whenever
we
have
a
disagreement
and
I
find
that
I
am
unable
to
express
myself
vocally,
I
write
out
my
thoughts.
For
example,
last
year
I
told
him
I
wanted
to
stop
drinking.
When
he
questioned
my
motives,
I
had
so
many
thoughts
on
the
subject
it
was
hard
to
give
him
one
straight
answer.
So
I
wrote
him
a
letter,
detailing
a
half
a
dozen
different
reasons
why
drinking
no
longer
appealed
to
me.
Though
we
are
both
strong
speakers,
sometimes
we
find
it
easier
to
convey
our
thoughts
to
each
other
on
paper.
In
order
for
my
career
as
a
writer
to
flourish,
it
is
essential
to
surround
myself
with
those
who
challenge
me.
