I
am
a
writer.
A
writer
I
am.
NI
am
Sam.
Sam
I
am.O
ItOs
my
first
memory
involving
literature
and
I
mean
a
real
memory,
not
one
that
IOve
recreated
for
myself
based
off
of
stories
my
family
remembers.
No,
my
first
real
memory
involving
the
printed
word
goes
back
to
Dr.
Seuss.
IOm
fairly
certain
Green
Eggs
and
Ham
was
not
the
first
book
to
which
I
was
introduced.
In
fact,
I
donOt
even
think
it
was
the
first
Seuss
creation
that
my
father
read
to
me
but
it
is
the
first
book
I
can
remember.
It
was
the
first
(and
possibly
the
only)
book
my
father
and
I
really
shared.
That,
above
all
else,
is
probably
why
it
stands
out
over
the
other
canonical
childrenOs
classics
like:
Are
You
My
Mother?
and
Pat
the
Bunny.
For
the
first
few
years
of
my
life
Dad
worked
all
day,
everyday
(or
so
it
seemed
to
a
three
year
old),
but
whenever
he
was
home
for
my
bedtime
we
would
read
Green
Eggs
and
Ham.
I
knew
every
word,
and
I
liked
the
way
the
poem
flowed.
Although
at
the
time
I
was
too
young
to
know
words
as
imposing
as
OrepetitionO
and
Oportmanteau,O
I
knew
that
there
was
some
significance
to
the
choice
and
order
of
SeussOs
words.
I
used
to
count
the
OIOs
on
my
fingers
as
Dad
would
turn
pages.
I
didnOt
have
any
idea
why
they
mattered,
but
it
amused
me
that
they
were
used
so
liberally;
surely
anything
with
such
a
presence
must
be
important.
NIO
might
not
be
an
impressive
first
word
to
recognize
in
print,
but
itOs
definitely
the
first
one
I
could
read.
Reading
wasnOt
always
so
easy
for
me
to
grasp.
When
I
started
out
way
back
in
the
years
of
Rugrats
cartoons
and
pokmon
cards,
I
couldnOt
read
much
of
anything.
There
were
whispers
that
I
might
be
dyslexic,
like
my
father,
or
incompetent,
which
isnOt
a
family
trait.
IOve
been
told
in
the
years
since
that
my
teacher
compared
me
to
a
firework
with
an
especially
long
fuse
line;
although
she
lit
the
end
with
her
teachings,
it
took
a
long
time
for
the
fire
to
travel
all
the
way
to
my
brain.
Thing
is,
once
I
finally
distinguished
my
lower-case
Bs
from
my
lower-case
Ds,
I
took
off.
It
sounds
clichd
to
say
that
books
were
the
air
and
sustenance
on
which
my
childhood
form
thrived,
but
it
is
a
fact
that
NReaderO
is
the
defining
noun
of
my
childhood.
I
was
lousy
at
sports
and
while
I
was
good
at
academics,
perfect
scores
are
not
usually
what
define
a
seven
year
old.
At
that
age,
everyone
is
friends
with
everyone,
but
seven
is
also
an
age
at
which
you
start
to
establish
the
people
who
will
remain
your
friends
from
there
on.
I
met
the
girl
who
is
presently
my
closest
confidant
when
I
was
seven.
While
we
had
always
been
cordial,
our
friendship
only
really
began
when
we
realized
that
we
both
had
copies
of
the
same
unicorn
novel
in
our
backpacks.
For
me,
reading
and
writing
have
always
been
tightly
linked;
like
salt
and
pepper
or
left
and
right.
I
know
they
are
two
different
things,
but
I
am
of
the
firm
belief
that
in
order
to
be
a
good
writer
one
must
be
a
reader.
It
doesnOt
particularly
matter
what
you
read
so
long
as
you
are
reading.
The
more
one
reads,
the
bigger
oneOs
vocabulary
tends
to
be.
The
bigger
vocabulary
one
has,
the
more
words
they
possess
to
play
with.
It
would
sound
as
though
I
were
paraphrasing
Dumbledore
in
the
latest
Harry
Potter
film
if
I
were
to
express
the
way
words
to
me
are
an
infinite
source
of
fascination.
It
would
sound
like
plagiarism,
but
it
is
absolutely
true.
It
is
amazing
the
way
the
order
of
a
sentence
can
change
its
meaning
entirely.
I
think
this
fascination
with
words
is
something
IOve
always
had;
even
as
a
kid
I
liked
writing.
NCreative
WritingO
was
the
best
part
of
the
day
in
elementary
school.
I
donOt
remember
most
of
what
I
wrote
as
a
youngster,
but
snippets
of
memories
come
to
visit
every
so
often.
The
earliest
memory
I
have
of
writing
is
from
when
I
was
six
years
old,
in
Mrs.
WidmanOs
first
grade
class.
IOm
not
really
clear
on
the
details;
itOs
one
of
those
memories
that
IOm
not
sure
of.
ItOs
an
event
thatOs
been
retold
so
many
times
around
my
dining
room
table
that
I
couldnOt
honestly
say
whether
I
remember
it,
or
if
I
have
just
pieced
together
enough
of
the
details
from
my
parentsO
retellings
as
to
create
a
convincing
replica
of
a
memory.
I
donOt
remember
the
plot
or
the
purpose
of
the
story
I
wrote
then.
It
definitely
must
have
been
written
in
late
November
or
December
though,
because
it
certainly
had
a
Christmas
theme.
All
I
know,
all
anyone
can
seem
to
remember
about
this
hallmark
of
my
portfolio,
is
that
at
one
point
or
another,
I
had
Rudolph
the
Red
Nosed
Reindeer
fly
SantaOs
sleigh
straight
into
a
terribly
oversized
menorah.
That
detail
is
the
only
remnant
that
has
survived
the
past
thirteen
years.
That
plot
device
is
said
to
have
won
me
awards
and
honors
of
some
great
merit.
Again,
time
and
exaggeration
have
taken
their
toll.
No
one
is
actually
sure
of
the
name
of
this
supposed
award;
for
all
I
know
it
could
actually
just
be
a
certificate
with
a
dancing
monkey
and
a
balloon
proclaiming
O#1
Student!O
signed
by
my
teacher.
It
doesnOt
matter
though,
not
to
me.
This
story
served
a
far
greater
purpose:
whenever
anyone
asks
my
mother
when
she
realized
that
I
was
going
to
be
a
writer,
she
always
has
the
same
answer.
SheOll
roll
her
eyes,
and
with
a
smirk
at
my
embarrassed
cringe
sheOll
tell
them,
NWhen
she
had
Rudolph
crashing
into
a
menorah,
I
had
an
inkling.O
There
were
other
signs.
Other
experiences
from
when
I
was
young
that
cannot
be
ignored
when
giving
a
history
of
my
friendship
with
words.
For
me,
not
writing
was
never
an
option,
and
after
a
certain
point,
twenty
minutes
in
the
classroom
just
wasnOt
enough
time
to
satiate
my
desire
for
words.
Because
I
was
young,
and
knew
I
was
young,
I
thought
I
was
too
small
and
too
inexperienced
to
write
OrealO
books.
Instead,
in
the
middle
years
of
elementary
school,
I
started
an
e-mail
newspaper.
At
the
time,
I
had
a
big
gaggle
of
friends
at
school,
and
we
fancied
that
we
were
in
some
sort
of
elitist
club.
We
were
at
the
age
where
our
parents
were
starting
to
ease
us
into
computers,
and
almost
all
of
us
had
recently
acquired
sparkly
new
e-mail
accounts.
It
started
because
I
was
bored;
e-mail
was
not
as
fascinating
as
my
eight-year-old
self
had
expected
it
to
be.
The
only
emails
I
seemed
to
be
getting
were
spam
and
forwarded
jokes
from
my
cat-lady
aunt.
I
decided
to
make
myself
less
bored
by
making
email
more
interesting,
and
so
the
Pika
News
(it
was
the
nineties,
Pokmon
was
still
hip)
was
born.
It
started
out
with
just
me
writing,
and
a
few
friends
reading,
but
before
long
my
silly,
little
newspaper
evolved.
It
stayed
silly,
and
by
most
definitions
it
stayed
small,
but
I
had
a
whole
staff
of
friends
writing.
We
were
writing
for
each
other,
so
no
one
was
embarrassed
or
ashamed.
We
wrote
poems
and
goofy
stories.
We
made
up
fake
advice
columns
and
mad
libs.
We
pretended
like
we
knew
things
about
boys
and
make-up.
We
wrote
for
ourselves
and
never
pretended
otherwise.
And
so
it
kept
going,
from
third
grade
up
through
middle
school,
just
dancing
into
high
school.
The
readers
and
writers
changed
as
the
years
progressed,
but
I
kept
writing
and
organizing.
It
was
only
a
once-a-month
thing,
so
it
really
didnOt
take
up
much
of
my
time,
and
I
enjoyed
it
so
much.
In
fact,
the
Pika
News
only
died
out
once
I
hit
high
school
and
stopped
having
the
time
for
it.
IOve
never
been
one
of
those
girls
who
kept
a
journal,
as
much
as
I
aspired
to
be
one
when
I
was
younger.
There
are
dozens
of
notebooks
who
serve
as
tribute
to
my
dozens
of
failed
attempts
at
starting
a
journal.
Thing
is,
when
it
comes
to
(voluntarily)
writing
about
me,
I
write
when
things
are
upsetting
and
I
write
when
I
feel
as
though
I
cannot
talk
about
my
problems
with
anyone.
My
middle
school
years
are
completely
documented
in
small
angry
handwriting;
but
aside
from
those
three
angst-ridden
years,
IOve
mostly
been
a
pretty
happy
person,
or
at
least,
IOve
always
had
other
outlets.
The
problem
was,
most
authors
that
I
was
reading
in
early
high
school
strongly
advised
aspiring
writers
to
keep
journals.
I
blame
those
words
of
wisdom
for
all
the
wasted
composition
notebooks
stuffed
into
my
bookshelf
(because
you
canOt
throw
out
a
diary,
even
if
itOs
a
barely
started
one).
IOve
known
that
I
wanted
to
write
since
before
I
can
remember
making
a
cognitive
decision
about
my
future;
it
probably
dates
back
to
Rudolph
and
his
menorah.
Regardless,
writing
has
always
been
a
part
of
my
life,
so
when
I
realized
that,
after
years
of
trying,
there
is
no
way
IOm
ever
going
to
be
one
of
those
people
who
manage
to
religiously
keep
a
journal,
I
decided
that
I
needed
to
find
another
way
to
practice.
I
started
to
write
for
me.
It
was
mostly
short
stories,
with
a
few
failed
attempts
at
longer
works.
I
made
up
my
own
characters,
or
borrowed
from
other
authors.
To
me,
it
didnOt
matter
what
I
was
writing
about,
so
long
as
I
was
writing.
I
practiced
with
words
and
experimented
with
styles.
I
didnOt
share
my
work
with
people.
I
didnOt
think
it
was
good
enough,
and
being
somewhat
of
a
perfectionist
as
well
as
intent
on
preserving
my
pride,
I
didnOt
want
to
show
my
friends
and
family
anything
less
than
my
best.
Even
now,
as
a
college
student,
I
only
feel
comfortable
showing
people
work
that
I
had
to
write
for
an
assignment.
IOm
not
sure
why
that
is,
though
I
have
a
suspicion
that
itOs
because
IOve
always
been
told
that
everything
I
hand
in,
be
it
an
essay
or
a
poem
or
a
story,
is
very
well
done.
I
know
the
pieces
I
hand
in
at
school
are
nearly
always
well
received,
and
subconsciously
I
suspect
a
disconnect
between
how
I
write
for
school
and
how
I
write
for
pleasure.
Logically
I
suppose
that
shouldnOt
be
the
case;
my
writing
style
is
unlikely
to
change
just
because
IOm
not
working
on
an
assignment,
but,
then
again,
IOve
never
been
a
big
fan
of
logic.
High
School
is
really
when
I
came
into
my
own
as
a
writer.
When
I
was
a
sophomore
I
joined
the
staff
of
the
high
school
student
newspaper,
The
Rag.
When
I
was
a
junior,
I
was
named
the
youngest
editor
of
said
paper.
Suddenly
I
was
editing
other
studentsO
articles,
which
revitalized
my
fascination
with
words.
Reading
and
fixing
other
peopleOs
work
gave
a
whole
new
light
to
how
words
work.
Now
I
had
examples
of
why
things
have
to
be
done
in
a
specific
way
and
at
the
same
time
I
could
see
why
writing
doesnOt
have
to
follow
any
rules
at
all.
Things
can
be
written
in
a
thousand
different
ways
and
still
get
the
same
point
across.
The
only
things
that
change
with
each
variation
are
the
feelings
and
the
pictures
created
by
the
words.
Everyone
has
a
different
style
of
writing,
and
by
editing
other
peopleOs
work
I
began
to
respect
the
differences
that
make
us
distinctive
as
writers.
I
started
to
appreciate
why
some
things
just
sound
better,
and
through
seeing
the
differences
in
othersO
writing,
I
was
able
to
apply
what
I
learned
to
my
own.
That
same
year
I
also
took
my
first
AP
English
course.
I
am
unsure
whether
or
not
that
class
helped
my
personal,
more
creative,
writing
at
all,
but
it
is
definitely
the
reason
I
was
prepared
for
college
writing
expectations.
My
teacher
was
insane.
Her
expectations
outreached
what
was
fair
for
a
group
of
high
school
students.
At
the
time
I
hated
her,
but,
looking
back,
sheOs
the
reason
I
know
how
to
write
a
real
essay.
She
was
the
first
English
teacher
I
had
who
didnOt
treat
me
like
I
knew
what
I
was
doing
better
than
everyone
else.
I
came
in
cocky,
and,
while
she
didnOt
discourage
me,
I
always
felt
as
if
I
had
something
to
prove
with
her.
She
must
have
known
what
she
was
doing
with
me;
I
worked
harder
in
that
class
than
I
have
ever
worked
in
an
English
class
before.
I
annotated
and
read
every
book
and
play
twice.
I
wrote
each
essay
days
before
it
was
due.
I
learnt
every
single
literary
device
that
exists
in
modern
rhetoric
and
practiced
using
them
in
my
free
time.
The
last
was
actually
not
so
much
of
a
chore
as
an
exciting
revelation;
suddenly
all
the
patterns
that
I
had
previously
struggled
to
understand
and
emulate
had
names.
They
were
defined
with
examples
and
easy
explanations.
Things
like
synecdoche
and
anaphora
became
a
part
of
every
essay
I
wrote.
She
had
me
working
harder
and
with
the
least
amount
of
encouragement
I
had
ever
received
in
a
classroom.
She
did
not
treat
me
like
a
dunce,
and,
looking
back
she
did
grant
me
a
little
more
respect
than
she
gave
most
of
my
peers,
but
I
was
never
her
favorite.
It
was
only
at
the
end
of
the
year,
the
very
last
assignment,
that
she
treated
me
like
anything
more
than
an
averagely
talented
kid.
It
was
an
essay
about
Macbeth,
and
ironically
I
thought
it
was
the
worst
essay
I
had
ever
handed
in.
In
fact,
the
only
reason
she
said
anything
to
me
about
it
was
that
I
went
up
to
her
desk
a
day
or
so
after
handing
the
paper
in
(after
the
guilt
had
really
had
room
to
settle
in)
and
apologized
for
a
substandard
piece
of
work.
What
happened
next
remains
the
clearest
memory
I
have
of
that
teacher.
She
leaned
across
her
desk
and
I
resisted
the
urge
to
take
a
step
back;
she
was
young
and
very
proficient
with
eyeliner,
but
also
incredibly
intimidating
to
look
at,
and
I
was
already
nervous.
Maybe
I
shouldnOt
have
been.
My
crazy,
unrealistic
teacher
proceeded
to
tell
me
that
my
horrifying
Macbeth
essay
was
the
best
essay
she
had
read
that
year.
I
was
the
first
OA+O
she
had
ever
given.
In
those
few
moments
I
learnt
almost
as
much
as
I
had
all
year
with
her.
It
didnOt
matter
if
I
didnOt
like
my
writing.
Different
people
appreciate
different
styles;
just
because
I
donOt
like
something
does
not
mean
it
is
bad,
it
just
means
itOs
not
done
to
my
taste.
There
is
a
difference
between
not
liking
the
way
something
is
done
and
finding
something
to
be
atrociously
written.
It
was
a
fact
I
had
known
for
years
as
a
reader,
but
it
wasnOt
until
that
minute,
standing
opposite
my
formidable
high
school
English
teacher
that
I
learned
its
implications
to
a
writer.
I
still
avoid
handing
in
pieces
that
I
donOt
like,
but
IOve
come
to
realized
that
professors
and
I
may
disagree
or
like
different
styles
of
writing.
Since
then
IOve
taken
other
English
classes;
senior
year
I
was
in
both
AP
English
Lit
(the
second
of
the
two
English
APs)
and
a
creative
writing
course.
Neither
of
those
really
made
as
big
of
an
impact
on
my
writing
as
my
first
experience
with
college-level
English.
True,
the
creative
writing
class
did
make
me
a
little
more
open
to
sharing
my
more
personal
writing
by
forcing
me
to
do
so,
but
in
AP
English
Lit
I
was
the
favorite
again,
and,
as
lovely
as
it
feels
to
be
the
favorite,
IOd
come
to
realize
that
you
tend
to
learn
a
lot
more
when
you
have
something
to
prove
rather
than
something
to
lose.
Due
to
my
extensive
experiences
in
high
school,
I
really
did
not
have
any
trouble
adjusting
to
LafayetteOs
expectations
when
it
came
to
writing.
The
AP
English
classes
were
not
the
only
college-level
high
school
classes
I
was
taking;
I
had
been
writing
essays
for
college-level
history,
math
and
science
since
I
was
a
sophomore.
There
is
obviously
a
discrepancy
between
college
level
high
school
classes
and
actual
college
classes,
but
when
it
came
to
the
written
expectations,
I
had
no
trouble.
This
ease
did
not
go
unnoticed
by
compatriots.
Before
long
it
became
my
Nthing.O
I
was
the
kid
in
the
common
room
you
were
supposed
to
ask
for
help
with
wordings
or
beg
to
edit
essays.
I
was
good
at
editing,
fixing
things
without
re-writing
them.
And
I
liked
it,
liked
filling
that
role.
IOm
not
good
enough
with
math
or
chemistry
to
really
help
anyone;
in
those
subjects
most
of
the
time
IOm
the
one
looking
for
aid.
Words
however
are
my
territory.
I
donOt
mind
spending
twenty
or
thirty
minutes
helping
a
friend,
or
a
stranger,
with
words.
IOve
always
enjoyed
helping
people,
and,
well,
playing
with
their
words
is
nearly
as
fun
as
playing
with
my
own.
IOve
been
writing
since
I
was
a
kid,
both
in
school
and
out.
Even
during
the
summer
months
I
rarely
fall
out
of
practice
with
words.
Writing
is
such
an
integral
part
of
my
life
that
I
cannot
imagine
going
without
it.
ItOs
an
addiction.
IOm
addicted
to
words,
addicted
to
the
ways
in
which
they
can
be
manipulated,
the
ways
in
which
they
can
be
twisted.
IOm
addicted
to
the
stories
one
can
paint
with
words,
addicted
to
ink
and
pixels
that
form
each
letter.
IOve
been
addicted
my
whole
life.
There
is
no
one
thing
that
lit
the
spark
that
ignited
this
need,
but
there
are
dozens
of
examples
of
its
existence.
The
only
thing
I
have
always
known
about
my
ever-changing
future
is
that,
even
if
I
end
up
working
in
some
claustrophobic
cubicle;
I
will
never
be
just
another
drone.
Writing
is
not
something
I
can
turn
off;
itOs
not
a
need
I
can
ignore.
Even
if
I
never
publish,
even
if
I
only
write
for
my
own
pleasure,
I
will
still
be
writing.
I
am
a
writer,
a
writer
I
am.
