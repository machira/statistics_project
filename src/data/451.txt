RETURNING
WRITING
ASSOCIATES
ESSAY:
Writing
as
a
WA
August
16,
2004
Becoming
a
Writing
Associate
has
been
a
very
significant
move
for
me
both
as
a
writer
and
as
a
critical
reader.
Being
put
in
the
position
as
a
writing
NexpertO
relative
to
those
attending
my
conferences
was
a
unique
experience,
and
one
that
led
me
to
be
far
more
careful
in
how
I
read,
a
pattern
that
carried
over
into
my
own
writing
and
revising.
Going
into
a
conference
(my
first
ones
especially)
I
was
nervous
about
filling
up
the
time,
and
about
seeming
prepared
and
confident
in
my
remarks.
As
a
result,
I
took
a
great
deal
of
time
in
marking
up
each
paper
D
writing
comments
in
all
of
the
margins,
highlighting
certain
passages,
or
even
circling
misspelled
words.
And
although
it
was
sometimes
difficult
to
differentiate
the
knowledgeable,
grateful
smiles
from
the
blank
ones
in
regards
to
my
commentary,
I
began
to
get
the
feeling
that
these
students
trusted
what
I
was
saying,
as
if
I
really
was
some
kind
of
expert,
some
kind
of
authority
figure.
So
as
my
nerves
died
down
about
making
a
conference
run
smoothly,
my
time
spent
on
their
work
didnOt
lessen
D
there
was
now
an
added
pressure
to
really
know
what
I
was
talking
about!
Some
of
these
first
conferences
were
enormously
eye-opening.
When
I
had
met
with
the
professor
about
the
paper
topics,
I
had
mentally
outlined
what
kind
of
papers
I
would
expect
and
what
directions
these
students
would
take.
In
many
cases
the
results
I
received
were
miles
away
from
anything
I
could
have
anticipated.
This
was
meaningful
in
a
few
ways.
First,
it
reminded
me
that
any
approach
I
might
take
to
a
given
topic
could
be
vastly
different
from
the
way
in
which
another
student
might.
It
made
me
realize
that
perhaps
it
would
benefit
me
to
discuss
these
topics
with
others
just
to
see
these
alternate
angles.
On
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
some
of
these
papers
also
showed
me
that
perhaps
writing
a
paper
wasnOt
necessarily
as
straightforward
or
simple
as
I
might
sometimes
assume.
What
I
mean
by
this
is
that
many
of
these
works
were
confusing,
convoluted
attempts
that
provided
what
could
hardly
pass
as
a
sufficient
answer
to
the
given
question.
They
often
skirted
around
the
topic,
rarely
provided
a
stable
thesis
and
had
grammar
errors
that
would
have
made
my
middle
school
teachers
cringe.
It
was
so
strange
to
realize
that
high
school
graduates
attending
my
college
could
actually
submit
such
poor
papers!
Why
couldnOt
they
express
coherent
ideas?
I
donOt
mean
to
sound
like
a
snob
here,
but
some
of
them
were
really
shocking.
This
realization
made
me
excited
about
my
job.
The
possibility
to
really
help
these
students
learn
how
to
better
express
their
thoughts
on
paper
was
something
that
made
the
thought
of
editing
and
the
conferences
that
followed
worthwhile
and
fun.
This
excitement
was
furthered
as
the
semester
continued
and
in
many
cases
I
did
see
improvement.
Of
course
this
forward
progression
in
their
writing
could
have
been
a
result
of
a
number
of
things
D
like
getting
used
to
the
expectations
of
college
writing
in
general,
for
example
D
but
I
liked
to
think
that
I
was
contributing
to
their
success
in
some
way.
When
a
student
turned
up
to
a
conference
with
a
thesis
(even
a
weak
one)
I
did
a
mental
victory
lap
D
they
had
listened
to
what
IOd
said
last
time!
When
a
student
who
previously
had
jumped
around
from
point
to
point
created
an
organized
series
of
paragraphs
I
was
proud.
I
was
also
flattered
when,
in
many
cases,
I
received
emails
from
the
students
containing
second
drafts,
the
text
preceding
the
attachment,
in
many
cases,
containing
some
plea
for
me
to
look
at
something
in
particular,
or
asking
if
they
had
sufficiently
corrected
something
I
had
said
needed
to
be
strengthened.
In
addition,
these
sessions
taught
me
something
about
my
own
writing.
Seeing
these
papers
and
talking
to
these
students
opened
my
eyes
to
the
idea
that
although
some
people
may
be
the
most
brilliant
engineers,
mechanics
or
mathematicians,
they
may
truly
not
be
able
to
write.
I
had
always
considered
myself
a
pretty
good
writer,
and
certainly
someone
capable
of
cranking
out
a
decent
paper,
but
I
had
never
really
given
much
thought
to
the
idea
that
writing
was
a
skill
that
not
everybody
has.
This
in
turn
led
me
to
wonder
D
how
good
of
a
writer
was
I?
In
many
ways
these
works
enabled
me
to
feel
proud
to
know
that
I
was
a
strong
writer,
someone
who
could
look
at
a
piece
of
writing
and
pick
out
strengths
and
weaknesses,
and
furthermore
could
assist
a
student
in
understanding
his/her
own
patterns
in
order
to
break
bad
habits
or
continue
to
build
on
good
ones.
It
made
me
grateful
for
the
teachers
IOd
had
and
all
of
the
writing
IOd
done
in
the
past.
But
they
also
helped
me
to
question
how
strong
I
really
was.
Was
I
as
critical
to
my
own
work
as
I
was
to
theirs?
Certain
small
items
were
raised
to
my
attention.
For
example,
I
noted
my
own
tendency
to
create
mammoth
paragraphs,
or
to
jump
from
the
past
to
the
present
tense
and
back
again.
These
issues,
although
seemingly
so
flagrant
and
easily
correctable
on
the
paper
of
another
student
were
errors
that
often
appeared
in
my
own
work.
The
simple
connection
from
there
was
indeed
that
I
rarely
did
much
of
my
own
revision.
My
pattern
instead
was
to
save
something
until
the
last
minute
and
depend
on
my
writing
background
to
lead
me
through
a
one-time
draft
that
I
would
then
hurriedly
hand
in
the
next
day.
As
a
result
many
of
the
papers
I
received
back
were
far
from
my
best
work.
What
was
the
point,
then,
of
having
any
kind
of
writing
skill
if
I
was
wasting
it
in
this
way?
Instead,
I
realized,
I
should
be
pushing
myself
to
write
better
papers,
allow
myself
to
give
more
time
so
that
I
could
be
proud
to
attach
my
name
to
them.
In
addition
I
became
more
critical
of
my
own
editing
style.
Were
my
conferences
as
productive
as
those
of
my
peers?
What
kinds
of
things
did
they
suggest
that
I
did
not?
This
kind
of
questioning
led
to
many
an
afternoon
supplementing
my
editing
with
not-so-subtle
eavesdropping
as
conferences
took
place
around
me.
In
many
cases
I
found
similarities,
perhaps
resulting
in
part
from
the
fact
that
we
participated
in
the
same
training
program.
One
of
the
major
lessons
I
learned
about
my
own
style
was
that
I
had
in
some
ways
gone
against
the
initial
advice
to
stick
to
the
Nhigher
order
concerns.O
I
had
instead
a
tendency
to
circle
each
misspelled
word,
to
correct
grammar
and
to
highlight
punctuation
errors.
Perhaps
this
was
a
little
too
detailed
when
many
of
the
papers
lacked
a
thesis,
but
it
was
something
I
found
unavoidable
as
I
read
through
a
paper.
Other
Writing
Associates
that
I
watched
took
the
tactic
of
circling
something
the
first
time,
and
suggesting
that
the
student
watch
for
these
kind
of
mistakes.
That
advice
was,
perhaps,
more
valuable
than
mine,
as
it
would
lead
the
student
to
address
the
issue
and
consciously
avoid
it
in
future
work.
Although
that
may
seem
small
or
fairly
insignificant,
I
still
found
it
to
be
an
interesting
lesson,
and
something
I
can
incorporate
in
my
future
conferences.
In
addition
to
these
lessons
learned
during
my
semester
as
a
Writing
Associate,
I
learned
a
great
deal
from
my
semester
NoffO
as
I
went
abroad
to
Sydney,
Australia.
Writing
at
Sydney
NUniO
was
different
in
many
ways.
Superficially
it
was
different
in
that
I
had
to
be
very
careful
about
spelling
color
as
Ncolour,O
or
putting
an
NsO
instead
of
a
NzO
in
the
word
Norganize.O
Many
of
my
papers
were
typed
on
university
owned
computers
which,
of
course,
had
a
British-style
spell-check
system,
and
this
drastically
simplified
the
process.
It
was
strange
though
D
I
had
been
told
that
Australian
professors
didnOt
like
it
when
Americans
didnOt
adhere
to
spelling
and
grammatical
rules
and
despite
how
painful
it
was
to
go
against
the
advice
I
had
been
giving
my
students
for
an
entire
semester
D
putting
punctuation
OUTSIDE
quotation
marks
--
I
put
in
the
effort
to
make
the
changes.
Even
now
my
brain
goes
on
NAustralia
autopilotO
and
I
find
myself
writing
about
the
beautiful
Sydney
NHarbourO
before
I
allow
myself
to
write
it
in
the
American
style.
But
above
and
beyond
these
seemingly
insignificant
changes
were
some
dramatically
different
academic
expectations.
In
exams
professors
did
not
simply
expect
you
to
answer
the
question
fully.
In
order
to
get
above
a
C
you
would
instead
need
to
cite
extra
resources,
supplement
your
answers
with
further
information,
and
throw
in
as
many
dates
and
names
as
possible.
In
paper
writing
there
were
also
different
approaches
from
that
to
which
I
had
grown
accustomed.
In
speaking
to
a
professor
after
what
I
will
call
an
NunexpectedO
grade
result
from
a
written
exam,
I
asked
about
her
expectations
for
the
upcoming
paper.
I
had
heard
that
Americans
were
usually
shocked
by
the
difference
when
studying
abroad
there,
and
wanted
to
be
prepared
before
I
had
to
send
those
grades
home.
She
told
me
that
the
Australian
style
was
perhaps
less
flowery
than
what
I
thought
was
normal.
Essentially,
she
said,
Australians
donOt
write
introductory
paragraphs
telling
you
what
the
paper
will
say
D
they
just
say
it,
and
right
away.
In
another
class
as
papers
were
displayed
on
the
overhead
as
examples,
I
was
shown
work
that
basically
used
its
thesis
as
the
first
sentence.
Coming
from
a
harsh
training
in
high
schoolOs
AP
English,
studying
under
a
professor
who
drilled
into
us
a
pattern
of
introductory
paragraphs
until
I
had
forgotten
there
was
any
other
way
to
structure
a
paper,
I
was
mildly
lost.
But
then
again
it
was
also
mildly
freeing.
No
introduction?
No
more
laboring
(or
should
I
say
NlabouringO)
in
an
attempt
to
figure
out
how
to
cleverly
introduce
my
topic
and
expertly
weave
in
my
thesis.
But
as
I
sat
down
to
try
and
write
it
was
slightly
disarming,
writing
that
straightforward
and
quick.
Gradually
though,
as
I
wrote
a
few
more
papers
over
the
course
of
the
semester
I
figured
out
how
it
was
done
(without
the
help
of
a
WA
program
of
course!)
and
got
used
to
this
new
system.
I
am
hoping,
of
course,
that
it
will
not
now
interfere
with
the
expectations
of
professors
back
at
Lafayette!
I
do
think,
however,
that
it
did
aid
me
in
more
succinctly
expressing
my
thoughts
and
arriving
at
my
main
points
more
quickly
without
the
unnecessary
fluff
that
I
tend
to
throw
in
without
even
realizing
IOm
doing
it.
I
hope
too
that
this
lesson
is
something
I
can
pass
on
to
the
students
to
which
IOm
assigned
for
this
upcoming
semester.
Before
writing
this
paper,
I
thought
little
of
what
I
had
gained
this
past
year
as
a
writer.
ItOs
not
something
I
had
truly
lent
any
thought
to
prior
to
receiving
this
assignment.
However,
through
recalling
what
I
have
done
both
as
a
WA
and
as
a
study
abroad
student
it
becomes
immediately
apparent
that
I
have
indeed
changed
and
grown
as
a
writer
in
these
last
12
months.
Working
as
a
WA
has
made
me
a
more
conscious
reader
and
writer.
Practicing
my
editing
skills
by
reviewing
the
work
of
others
and
aiding
them
in
correcting
both
large
and
small
scale
errors
has
helped
me
to
create
a
clearer
image
of
what
I
want
in
my
own
writing,
as
in
what
habits
to
avoid
and
what
to
continue.
It
has
made
me
more
critical
of
my
own
habits,
and
more
committed
to
allowing
myself
the
same
kind
of
revision
time
that
I
dedicate
to
my
students.
In
my
time
away
from
the
WA
scene,
too,
I
have
become
(I
hope)
a
more
focused
and
confident
writer.
In
my
efforts
to
cut
out
any
fluff
I
have
been
forced
to
ensure
that
my
ideas
are
strong
and
my
paragraphs
concise
and
to
the
point.
And
although
the
spelling
and
punctuation
rules
are
back
to
normal,
I
think
that
seeing
another
style
of
writing
has
helped
to
expand
my
own
tool
kit
of
approaches
to
paper
writing.
I
certainly
hope
that
my
experiences
both
as
a
WA
and
abroad
will
contribute
to
making
my
senior
year
more
successful
D
both
in
my
own
writing,
and
in
my
work
with
the
Writing
Associate
program.
