It
is
always
interesting
to
reflect
on
the
events
of
a
year
that
has
come
and
gone
in
the
blink
of
an
eye.
The
ritual
usually
renders
surprising
results,
conjuring
up
images
that
seem
simultaneously
like
yesterday
and
decades
ago,
although
they
all
happened
within
one
yearOs
time.
Reminiscing
about
the
past
year,
especially
about
my
writing
experiences,
has
revealed
a
satisfying
sense
of
accomplishment
similar
to
that
of
admiring
a
championship
trophy
on
the
top
shelf.
Coming
into
a
writing
associate
position
in
the
fall
of
2004,
I
hadnOt
had
much
college
writing
experience,
though
most
of
my
written
communication
skills
developed
throughout
the
rigorous
high
school
curriculum
to
which
I
was
exposed.
During
my
sophomore
year
at
Lafayette
however,
both
my
writing
and
thought
processes
underwent
a
significant
transition.
My
eyes
were
opened
to
many
different
styles
of
writing,
through
working
with
student
writers
as
part
of
the
College
Writing
Program
and
exploring
new
genres
during
my
own
coursework.
I
have
always
considered
myself
a
strong
writer,
dedicated
to
communicating
effectively
and
creatively.
I
also
perceived
myself
as
a
seasoned
writing
veteran,
if
only
based
upon
my
high
school
level
compositions.
My
first
year
as
a
writing
associate
served
to
dispel
many
of
those
perceptions
as
I
learned
to
express
myself
in
different
ways
and
approach
writing
in
a
more
formal
manner.
As
a
writing
associate
to
an
FYS
course
on
the
European
Union,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
work
with
sixteen
freshmen
writers
at
various
levels
of
written
and
verbal
communication
abilities.
Many
advantages
accompanied
this
opportunity,
including
a
mutual
learning
environment
between
me
and
my
slightly
younger
peers.
Early
in
the
semester,
I
came
to
realize
that
there
were
about
sixteen
different
writing
styles,
one
for
each
of
the
sixteen
students
under
my
tutelage.
This
proved
to
be
a
challenge
for
me
since
I
had
developed
essentially
one
writing
style
and
tone
under
which
all
of
my
compositions
would
fall
over
the
course
of
my
writing
history.
However,
I
learned
quickly
that
everyoneOs
style
is
unique,
so
even
if
I
wouldnOt
necessarily
write
something
a
certain
way,
it
could
also
be
correct.
This
realization
helped
me
to
expand
my
writing
style
by
incorporating
new
ideas
and
thinking
outside
the
box
that
my
sixteen
freshmen
students
had
given
me.
Also
during
the
fall
semester,
I
was
enrolled
in
Music
in
Western
Civilization
to
satisfy
a
requirement
for
my
minor
in
music.
In
that
course,
I
was
responsible
for
writing
subjective
concert
reviews
and
analytical
papers,
although
I
didnOt
consider
those
assignments
too
challenging.
Through
holding
open
discussions
with
the
freshmen
students
about
their
writing,
I
was
able
to
take
a
closer
look
at
my
own
writing,
especially
on
these
types
of
manageable
assignments.
By
understanding
the
variety
of
elements
that
can
go
into
creating
a
piece
of
written
work
and
utilizing
different
approaches
that
I
learned
from
some
of
my
freshmen
students,
I
was
able
to
hone
my
writing
skills
on
these
concise,
descriptive
music
papers.
Although
I
didnOt
have
the
opportunity
to
work
on
a
variety
of
personal
writing
assignments
during
the
fall
semester,
I
learned
many
new
approaches
to
my
own
pre-writing,
writing
and
editing
from
working
on
four
writing
assignments
throughout
the
semester
with
the
FYS
students.
Additionally,
working
with
the
students
presented
an
unexpected
challenge
that
would
contribute
to
my
own
writing
process
in
the
future.
w
As
it
worked
out,
many
of
the
students
in
the
European
Union
FYS
neither
chose
that
course
nor
enjoyed
being
a
part
of
it.
This
is
often
a
familiar
scenario
with
required
college
courses,
but
this
particular
situation
was
unique
because
the
FYS
course
is
designed
to
be
writing
intensive,
making
frequent
use
of
the
College
Writing
Program.
Perhaps
many
students
donOt
realize
their
full
writing
potentials
because
they
view
the
writing
process
as
painful
or
disinteresting,
therefore
not
putting
in
the
most
enthusiastic
effort.
Thus,
the
challenge
of
helping
these
sixteen
freshmen
find
specific
topics
of
interest
to
ultimately
fashion
into
meaningful
compositions
was
one
that
many
students
and
I
both
found
educational
and
useful.
During
many
of
the
first-round
conferences,
students
would
just
sort
of
stare
blankly
at
me
waiting
for
our
conference
to
be
over,
contributing
minimally
despite
my
best
efforts
to
engage
them.
However,
I
viewed
this
as
a
challenge.
I
found
myself
asking
probing
questions
about
each
studentOs
specific
area
of
interest
within
the
broad
subject
of
the
assignment.
The
majority
of
the
students
really
came
to
open
up
to
me
about
a
topic
in
which
they
were
interested,
even
if
we
spent
most
of
the
conference
searching
newspapers
online
for
major
headlines
about
the
European
Union
for
inspiration.
Eventually
we
would
find
a
particular
subject
area
for
the
topic
of
the
paper
about
which
each
student
was
enthusiastic.
It
was
at
this
point,
without
knowing
it,
that
I
stumbled
upon
the
notion
that
it
is
indeed
possible
to
enjoy
writing
about
a
topic
that
may
initially
seem
of
little
interest.
After
spending
so
much
time
during
the
pre-writing
process
with
my
sixteen
freshmen,
I
learned
that
I,
too,
could
benefit
from
an
investment
of
20
minutes
on
the
internet
before
I
began
the
pre-writing
and
writing
processes
to
find
a
specific
issue
of
interest
that
would
serve
as
the
foundation
for
a
paper
about
which
I
would
be
enthusiastic.
w
Following
the
preliminary
online
research
that
the
students
and
I
did
together
during
our
first
round
of
conferences,
there
was
an
additional
conference
several
weeks
later
on
the
first
drafts
of
their
papers.
Some
papers
came
back
thorough
and
well
thought
out,
while
others
were
incomplete,
half-hearted
attempts
to
fill
up
space
on
enough
pages
to
look
like
some
effort
was
made.
Knowing
that
the
final
draft
was
due
in
exactly
one
week
from
the
date
of
our
conference,
I
was
shocked
that
so
much
work
still
needed
to
be
done
on
a
few
of
those
papers.
Several
students
needed
coaching
on
how
to
write
a
thesis
paper
(especially
one
student
whose
native
language
was
not
English),
but
others
simply
blew
it
off.
Either
way,
I
was
amazed
that
this
handful
of
students
could
leave
all
this
work
until
the
last
minute,
expecting
a
writing
associate
miracle
to
help
them
or
something.
But
with
each
student,
I
took
a
deep
breath,
though
about
the
main
issues
that
could
be
resolved
during
our
30
to
45-minute
conferences,
and
forged
on.
For
the
students
with
complete
drafts,
I
was
able
to
look
at
higher
order
concerns
such
as
clarity
based
upon
organization/
structure
or
appropriate
diction
for
the
subject
matter
and
audience.
For
the
students
with
incomplete
drafts,
however,
I
really
had
to
consider
the
most
important
issues,
such
as
creating
a
thesis
statement
upon
which
the
paper
should
be
based
and
providing
suitable
support
throughout
the
text.
Structural
nuances
and
subject-appropriate
diction
were
often
not
the
primary
concerns,
as
the
paper
did
not
yet
even
have
a
strong
foundation.
By
working
together
and
establishing
a
supportive
discussion
environment,
I
was
able
to
work
through
these
issues
by
showing
the
students
what
they
somehow
missed
along
the
way.
The
entire
start-to-finish
process
of
finding
an
exciting
topic,
establishing
a
workable
foundation
for
the
paper
and
refining
the
details,
was
one
that
the
students
were
able
to
replicate
on
later
papers
with
much
greater
ease
and
confidence.
Observing
this
process
as
a
participant
and
a
spectator
emphasized
the
importance
of
planning
the
writing
process
thoroughly,
while
also
setting
goals
and
standards
to
which
it
is
necessary
to
adhere
in
order
to
produce
a
high
quality
composition.
Additionally,
many
students
learned
to
become
experts
on
interesting
subjects
without
being
intimidated
by
a
knowledgeable
professor,
because
they
enjoyed
what
they
were
writing
about.
Pride
and
satisfaction
were
mutual
emotions
among
my
students
and
me
by
the
end
of
the
semester.
It
was
gratifying
to
have
one
or
two
students
each
round
of
conferences
boast
that
they
received
a
higher
grade
on
their
paper
than
they
ever
earned
before
in
their
writing
history.
This
is
a
skill
that
the
students
will
hopefully
take
with
them
for
their
future
writing
endeavors.
w
I
didnOt
realize
it
at
the
time,
but
working
with
the
sixteen
freshmen
students
was
a
learning
experience
for
me
as
well.
I
wouldnOt
find
this
out
until
the
spring
semester
during
my
VaST,
which
was
similar
in
structure
to
the
FYS
as
a
college
writing
requirement.
My
VaST
on
fin-de-sicle
Vienna
was
extremely
intimidating,
as
the
professor
held
course
expectation
meetings
in
October
of
the
prior
semester
to
ensure
that
we
understood
our
undertaking
and
the
writing
load
he
demanded.
I
knew
that
this
course
would
be
writing
intensive,
but
was
willing
to
try
my
hand
at
this
type
of
college
writing
for
the
first
time,
since
I
enjoyed
the
subject
of
the
course
and
already
had
a
background
in
much
of
the
material.
The
professor
has
been
teaching
at
Lafayette
for
at
least
the
past
30
years,
and
I
am
convinced
that
he
knows
everything
about
everything
and
then
some.
So
writing
two
large
term
papers
for
this
course
was
a
very
daunting
task.
Being
asked
to
present
a
specific
topic,
thesis
included,
two
months
in
advance
of
the
due
date
was
challenging,
in
that
I
didnOt
have
the
slightest
clue
about
a
subject
on
which
I
felt
confident
enough
to
write
a
term
paper
for
my
audience
D
the
professor
who
knew
all.
Then
one
afternoon,
close
to
the
thesis
submission
deadline,
it
hit
me.
Write
about
something
exciting,
enticing,
fun,
specific
to
the
interests
I
already
had.
Just
like
my
freshmen
students
months
earlier,
I
spent
a
while
on
the
internet
researching
influential
figures
in
pre-1900
Vienna
and
found
just
the
topic
D
Ludwig
van
Beethoven.
Not
only
did
Beethoven
interest
me,
but
as
a
classical
pianist
I
was
coincidentally
working
on
his
Grande
Sonate
Pathetique
on
a
daily
basis
at
the
time.
With
a
bit
more
research,
I
found
out
that
that
exact
composition
played
an
important
role
in
the
political
climate
of
the
19th
century,
helping
to
set
off
a
cultural
revolution
at
the
turn
of
the
20th
century.
Armed
with
a
specific
topic
(the
PathetiqueOs
historical
impact
on
19th-century
Vienna)
in
which
I
was
interested
on
many
levels,
the
writing
process
was
enjoyable
and
easy
for
the
next
two
months.
Having
learned
from
my
own
suggestion
and
the
success
of
my
students,
I
was
enthusiastic
about
BeethovenOs
role
in
pre-fin-de-sicle
Viennese
culture
and
wanted
to
learn
every
last
detail
about
the
subject.
This
led
me
to
become
an
expert
on
the
topic,
confident
enough
to
present
it
to
my
professor
in
an
informative
style
that
also
piqued
his
interest.
Having
chosen
an
attractive
subject
led
me
to
the
necessary
supporting
details,
helping
my
final
composition
of
fourteen
pages
sound
intelligent
and
enlightening.
I
was
the
only
one
in
the
class
to
receive
an
almost
perfect
score
of
198
out
of
200.
w
Reflecting
on
the
writing
of
my
sophomore
year,
I
realized
that
I
grew
tremendously
as
a
writer
and
a
communicator.
This
past
summer,
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
chosen
as
a
summer
intern
in
the
National
Accounts
Sales
Support
unit
of
a
large
health
insurance
corporation.
I
didnOt
know
much
about
the
job
when
I
began
three
months
ago,
but
I
knew
how
important
this
particular
department
was
to
the
growth
and
success
of
the
company
and
that
I
would
be
able
to
contribute
towards
this
goal.
Over
the
course
of
the
summer,
I
found
myself
engaged
in
written
communications
of
all
forms,
some
of
which
I
still
cannot
understand
the
magnitude.
On
more
than
one
occasion,
I
had
to
write
emails
to
a
top
executive
of
the
company
about
important
decision-making
issues
in
my
bossOs
absence.
The
governmental
sector
utilized
my
writing
and
revising
skills
numerous
times
in
legal
contract
reviews
to
improve
the
wording
of
customized
documents,
which
would
serve
as
cornerstones
for
the
Legal
DepartmentOs
review.
It
was
my
sole
responsibility
to
provide
detailed
mathematical
analyses,
accompanied
by
written
explanations
for
consultants
to
share
with
the
client.
All
this,
in
a
culture
where
time
is
money
and
words
cost
time.
And
as
a
result,
IOve
been
invited
back
to
work
for
this
corporation
as
an
intern
and
as
a
full-time
employee.
The
real
world
cannot
function
without
communication.
Especially
since
e-mail
and
blackberries
are
replacing
face-to-face
communications,
writing
skills
are
of
the
utmost
importance.
Abstract
math
and
miniscule
sciences
are
highly
specialized
fields,
which
only
few
can
master.
But
written
communication
is
a
skill
that
everyone
must
possess
in
order
to
interact
successfully
in
a
business
environment
of
any
type.
I
was
recently
told
that
I
was
hired
as
a
summer
intern
out
of
fifteen
candidates
because
of
my
strong
writing
background
among
other
things.
By
analyzing
my
growth
during
the
past
year,
it
is
easy
to
understand
why.
