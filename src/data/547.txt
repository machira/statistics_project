2007
This
past
year
was
an
interesting
one
for
me,
as
far
as
being
a
writer
and
a
Writing
Associate
is
concerned.
While
I
have
undoubtedly
learned
something
about
writing
as
a
genre
in
the
past
year
and
thus
improved
as
a
writer,
I
would
definitely
say
that
I
have
made
greater
improvements
in
my
awareness
of
my
own
writing.
That
is,
while
I
do
think
any
new
skills
I
have
acquired
this
past
year
are
important,
I
place
greater
value
on
my
recent
discovery
of
the
role
writing
plays
in
others'
lives.
I
worked
with
many
different
types
of
writers
this
year
and
I
feel
that
through
their
experiences
I
have
developed
a
new
appreciation
both
of
writing
in
and
of
itself
and
of
myself
as
a
writer.
I
was
fortunate
enough
in
my
first
year
as
a
Writing
Associate
to
spend
both
semesters
working
with
a
professor
with
whom
I
shared
the
same
philosophy
about
writing.
She
was
as
supportive
of
the
WA
program
as
I
myself
was,
and
she
made
sure
her
students
knew
it.
My
experience
this
past
fall
was
quite
a
different
one.
The
professor
I
was
paired
with
was
passionate
about
the
subject
of
the
First
Year
Seminar
that
he
was
teaching,
but
did
not
care
quite
as
much
about
the
writing
his
students
were
doing.
I
would
say
he
put
much
more
emphasis
on
what
the
students
were
saying
rather
than
how
they
said
it.
I
did
not
have
a
problem
with
this
view,
but
it
did
end
up
making
my
job
very
difficult.
Most
students
did
not
feel
the
need
to
come
see
me
about
their
writing,
because
the
professor
did
not
require
them
to
seek
my
assistance.
In
addition,
he
was
willing
to
read
drafts
of
their
papers
and
make
comments
on
them
before
handing
them
back
to
the
students
to
rewrite.
Again,
this
is
not
a
bad
practice;
in
fact,
it
probably
made
many
of
his
first
year
students
revise
their
writing
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives.
The
only
issue
I
had
with
this
process
is
that
he
essentially
made
my
job
unnecessary.
I
ended
up
resolving
this
situation
by
doing
all
I
could
to
help
the
few
students
who
did
seek
me
out.
There
were
some
students
whom
I
never
met,
throughout
the
course
of
the
semester.
There
were
others
I
saw
5
or
6
times,
which
is
more
than
a
WA
can
usually
ask
for.
This
semester
taught
me
just
how
differently
people
perceive
the
discipline
of
writing.
While
I
will
admit
I
have
been
guilty
of
neglecting
to
revise
on
many
occasions
and
there
have
been
times
in
which
I
did
not
feel
that
I
learned
from
a
WA
conference,
but
I
do
hold
myself
to
a
certain
standard
as
far
as
writing
is
concerned.
Some
of
the
students
I
met
in
the
fall
of
2006
clearly
did
not
feel
the
same.
Many
of
them,
upon
realizing
that
their
professor
would
guide
them
directly
through
the
revision
process,
were
content
to
hand
in
drafts
that
had
not
even
been
proof-read
and
simply
wait
for
their
teacher
to
tell
them
how
to
get
an
A.
Writing,
to
me,
is
much
more
personal
than
that.
I
am
not
always
satisfied
simply
because
I
received
a
good
grade
on
an
assignment,
and
even
more
often,
I
am
proud
of
something
I've
done
even
if
I
did
not
score
perfect
marks
on
it.
In
addition
to
learning
from
the
students
who
did
not
take
advantage
of
my
help,
I
also
learned
a
great
deal
from
those
who
did.
A
few
of
the
students
whom
I
saw
consistently
were
talented
writers;
they
just
were
intent
on
improving.
A
few
others
were
students
who
struggled
with
writing
and
were
aware
of
this.
Those
students
were
particularly
inspiring.
I
admired
their
discipline.
Even
though
their
professor
did
not
require
them
to
ask
for
help
they
did,
simply
because
they
sensed
they
needed
it.
I
also
probably
learned
the
most
from
these
students.
Their
unprompted
questions
helped
me
to
better
learn
how
to
do
my
job.
In
these
cases
I
wasn't
simply
pointing
out
places
of
error
or
warning
against
common
mistakes:
The
students
were
teaching
me
about
facets
of
writing
which
they
were
uncomfortable
with,
and
thus
forcing
me
to
learn
how
to
assist
them
in
new
ways.
I
had
a
decidedly
different
experience
with
my
WA
assignment
second
semester.
The
professor
I
was
paired
with
was
very
clear
on
what
he
wanted
both
from
me
and
his
students.
I
enjoyed
this
structure,
if
only
because
it
alleviated
a
lot
of
the
frustrations
I
had
during
the
previous
semester.
The
writing
assignments
in
this
class
were
also
very
different
in
nature.
While
the
FYS
I
worked
with
in
the
fall
of
2006
was
basically
portfolio
based,
the
VaST
class
I
worked
with
in
the
spring
of
2007
revolved
around
a
constant
revision
of
one
single
assignment.
I
have
to
say,
I
found
this
process
much
more
rewarding
as
a
Writing
Associate
then
the
past
semester's.
At
first
I
was
worried
that
I
would
have
trouble
with
this
assignment,
mostly
because
the
class
was
based
on
medical
technology
and
I
had
absolutely
no
knowledge
of
that
field.
The
in-depth
nature
of
the
assignments
the
students
were
given
made
me
wonder
if
I
would
be
able
to
comprehend
their
papers,
never
mind
help
them
revise
them.
I
worried
about
where
I
would
draw
my
authority
to
help
these
students
from,
considering
I
was
far
from
informed
about
what
they
were
writing.
In
the
end,
my
concerns
were
unfounded.
In
fact,
I
believe
my
lack
of
knowledge
of
subjects
the
students
were
writing
about
worked
to
my
advantage.
Each
student
worked
with
their
own
topic,
so
I
really
had
no
information
about
their
subjects
besides
what
they
wrote
on
the
page.
I
ended
up
learning
a
lot
about
very
interesting
medical
advances.
What
I
did
not
understand
through
a
student's
writing,
I
asked
him
to
explain.
I
ended
up
discussing
a
great
deal
of
controversial
issues
with
the
students,
helping
prompt
them
to
find
new
research
to
answer
my
questions.
These
exchanges
reminded
me
of
something
very
important
about
the
writing
process.
Writing
(and
academic
assignments,
in
particular)
must
be
reader-based.
The
beauty
of
being
a
writer
is
being
able
to
communicate
with
a
reader.
My
initial
ignorance
of
these
students'
subjects
helped
them
to
see
where
they
were
connecting
with
their
reader,
and
where
they
were
not.
I
found
the
experience
of
working
with
one
of
the
students
this
past
spring
particularly
rewarding,
for
I
had
worked
with
this
boy
a
year
and
a
half
before.
One
of
the
students
enrolled
in
the
VaST
I
was
assigned
was
also
in
the
FYS
I
worked
with
in
the
fall
of
2005.
I
remember
him
quite
clearly
from
that
first
class
because
of
how
much
effort
he
put
into
improving
his
writing.
While
he
had
been
living
in
the
United
States
for
almost
8
years,
English
was
still
his
second
language
and
thus
he
was
quite
self
conscious
as
far
as
writing
is
concerned.
I
never
considered
his
concerns
to
be
well
founded.
We
spent
the
majority
of
our
conferences
simply
going
over
the
phrases
in
his
papers
that,
while
not
usually
grammatically
incorrect,
seemed
awkward
to
my
English-speaking
ears.
This
young
man
often
had
better
ideas
than
his
classmates',
and
always
came
to
see
me
with
a
list
of
questions
so
he
could
be
sure
he
was
expressing
these
ideas
accurately.
Working
with
him
was
always
a
pleasure.
I
was
happy,
then,
when
I
went
to
meet
the
VaST
I
was
working
with
in
the
spring
of
2007
and
saw
him
there.
At
our
first
conference
of
the
semester
I
could
easily
see
how
much
he
had
improved
in
the
past
year
and
a
half.
He
was
no
longer
fumbling
with
the
conventions
of
the
English
language.
His
papers
flowed
just
as
easily
as
any
English
speaker's
would.
The
only
difference
between
my
conferences
with
him
and
those
with
some
of
his
classmates
was
that
he
was
much
more
willing
to
learn
than
many
of
them.
He
was
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
did
know
everything
about
his
topic
or
even
about
the
language
he
was
writing
about
it
in,
and
he
was
eager
to
hear
anything
I
had
to
say.
I
do
not
think
I
have
ever
been
more
impressed
with
a
student
as
I
was
with
this
boy.
His
desire
to
improve
his
writing
and
the
progress
he
made
due
to
that
attitude
was
simply
inspiring.
He
taught
me
that
even
though
writing
well
does
not
come
as
easily
to
some
as
it
does
to
others,
it
is
never
impossible.
The
last
experience
I
had
this
past
year
that
I
consider
being
influential
to
my
position
as
a
writer
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
position
as
a
Writing
Associate.
Earlier
this
summer
I
spent
some
time
at
Lafayette
starting
my
research
for
my
senior
thesis.
At
this
point
in
time
all
I
knew
was
that
I
wanted
to
focus
on
the
artistic
population
of
Easton.
In
order
to
learn
a
bit
more
about
my
subject
I
attended
a
meeting
of
the
Arts
Community
of
Easton
(ACE).
I
found
myself
sitting
next
to
an
older
woman
who
had
just
gone
back
to
school
in
order
to
get
a
bachelor's
degree
in
fine
arts.
We
spoke
about
her
own
art
for
a
while,
then
she
asked
me
if
I
was
an
artist,
and
if
so,
what
sort
of
art
I
produced.
I
intended
to
tell
her
no,
I
have
absolutely
no
artistic
talent
myself
and
therefore
greatly
admire
those
who
do,
but
before
I
could
get
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
I
reconsidered.
Instead,
I
told
her
that
I
write.
It
may
seem
strange,
but
I
had
honestly
never
thought
this
way
before
that
moment.
I
have
referred
to
myself
as
a
writer
in
the
past,
but
I
never
really
considered
my
writing
to
be
a
form
of
art.
After
all,
most
of
my
writing
is
academic
in
nature.
I
do
write
for
pleasure
on
occasion,
but
anything
I've
written
outside
of
a
class
is
writer
based
in
nature.
I
write
purely
because
I
feel
the
need
to,
and
I
have
never
shown
anyone
anything
I've
written
of
my
own
accord.
But
in
speaking
to
that
woman
about
her
own
art,
I
decided
that
writing
serves
me
much
the
same
purpose
that
still
life's
serve
her.
It
is
a
release,
a
form
of
expression,
and
a
passion.
Yes,
there
are
times
I
write
because
I
am
required
to,
but
there
are
times
this
woman
paints
because
a
class
she
is
taking
requires
that
of
her.
That
does
not
make
the
pieces
she
creates
lose
their
title
of
Nwork
of
art,O
so
why
should
the
academic
nature
of
the
majority
of
my
writing
discount
it
as
the
same?
This
conversation
gave
me
a
greater
appreciation
for
just
how
difficult
some
people
find
WA
conferences
to
be.
Writing
is
intensely
personal,
and
many
do
take
offense
to
even
constructive
criticism
of
their
work.
It
is
frustrating
when
a
reader
misses
the
point
in
a
work,
much
in
the
same
way
I'd
imagine
it
would
be
frustrating
for
an
artist
to
deal
with
an
audience
who
did
not
understand
his
piece.
I
think
a
big
problem
with
writing,
especially
in
an
academic
sense,
is
that
there
seem
to
be
too
many
rules
surrounding
it.
While
I
do
recognize
that
conventions
of
grammar
and
style
are
important
to
a
degree
in
order
to
make
reading
a
work
a
universal
experience,
I
do
not
think
writers
should
be
punished
for
NerrorsO
that
do
not
distract
from
the
meaning
of
a
piece.
A
misplaced
comma
is
not
the
end
of
the
world,
in
much
the
same
way
as
an
out
of
place
brush
stroke
does
not
take
away
from
the
emotion
of
a
painting.
There
must
be
some
sort
of
conformity
as
far
as
writing
is
concerned,
but
I
think
that
often
teachers
place
too
much
value
on
conventionality
at
the
expense
of
the
personality
of
the
writer
himself.
Again,
I
would
not
say
that
my
most
important
writing
experiences
this
year
were
those
in
which
I
learned
a
new
technique
or
perfected
a
certain
style.
Instead,
I
value
those
instances
where
I
learned
something
about
myself
I
had
not
realized
or
was
taught
something
about
others
that
I
was
also
unaware
of.
In
the
fall
of
2006
I
learned
about
the
differences
between
writers
and
how
to
do
my
best
to
help
all
of
them.
In
the
spring
of
2007
I
learned
the
value
of
the
reader
and
the
possibility
of
improvement.
This
past
summer
I
recognized
the
individuality
of
the
writing
experience
and
the
role
of
writing
outside
the
academic
sphere.
I
do
believe
that
these
lessons
are
much
more
important
than
any
grammar
instruction
can
ever
be.
I
am
one
of
those
people
who
tends
to
learn
by
example,
and
the
examples
others
have
set
for
me
this
past
year
have
done
a
lot
for
my
own
self
discovery.
I
am
sure
that
everything
I
have
learned
this
past
year
will
help
me
to
transfer
my
writing
from
academic
to
practical
as
I
graduate
and
move
on
to
quite
a
different
world
of
writing.
