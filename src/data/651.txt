On
Writing
ItOs
hard
for
me
to
remember
my
earliest
memory.
Maybe
it
is
of
drinking
a
can
of
MottOs
apple
juice
at
the
Takanassee
Beach
Club
on
the
Jersey
shore,
or
perhaps
it
is
of
the
time
I
was
in
preschool
and
accidentally
got
sawdust
in
my
eye
after
jumping
off
of
the
tire
fort
during
recess.
ItOs
too
difficult
for
me
to
know,
and
not
even
all
of
the
Omemory
enhancingO
ginkgo
biloba
in
the
world
would
help
me
remember.
From
what
my
mother
tells
me,
I
was
an
inventive
and
creative
child
who
was
always
interested
in
learning
and
having
fun.
When
I
was
younger,
my
older
sister
Taryn
had
a
habit
of
forcing
me
to
play
ridiculous
games
with
her.
She
used
to
pretend
that
she
was
a
zoo
trainer
and
I
was
a
monkey
that
she
cared
for
named
PJ.
On
another
occasion,
I
was
her
pet
Dalmatian
and
she
OgroomedO
me
by
cutting
a
chunk
out
of
the
front
of
my
90Os-style
mushroom
cut.
While
these
experiences
were
also
fun
for
me,
minus
the
bad
haircut,
I
remember
one
game
that
really
jump-started
my
life
as
a
writer:
the
time
my
sister
taught
me
how
to
write
my
name.
Like
always,
my
sister
was
up
to
her
typical
antics,
only
this
time
she
was
playing
teacher
and
I
was
her
student.
My
sister
started
class
with
an
introduction
that
went
something
along
the
lines
of,
NHello
students.
My
name
is
Ms.
and
today
I
will
teach
you
how
to
write
your
own
names.O
I
was
only
about
three
or
four
at
the
time,
so
this
was
a
very
exciting
moment
for
me.
My
sister
taught
me
the
six
letters
required
to
write
and
with
a
little
practice
I
was
finally
able
to
spell
and
write
my
own
name.
Much
to
my
sisterOs
dismay,
who
to
this
day
jokes
about
not
being
able
to
spell
to
save
her
life,
I
soon
surpassed
her
spelling
abilities
and
learned,
on
my
own,
how
to
spell
difficult
words
before
she
could,
like
restaurant
and
computer.
While
spelling
is
still
not
TarynOs
forte,
she
has
gone
on
to
become
a
teacher
for
Teach
For
America
and
is
a
much
better
educator
than
I
will
ever
be.
I
appreciate
the
time
she
spent
teaching
me
how
to
write
and
spell
my
name.
After
this
lesson
with
my
sister,
I
went
on
to
preschool
where
I
learned
the
remaining
twenty
letters
of
the
alphabet
and
began
learning
how
to
spell
simple
words
like
cat,
dog,
mom,
and
dad.
By
kindergarten,
I
could
formulate
my
own
sentences
and
my
class
was
required
to
keep
weekly
journals
and
complete
projects
emphasizing
writing.
I
remember
on
the
first
day
of
class,
we
colored
in
dinosaurs
and
wrote
out
sentences
like,
NThe
rhino
is
blue.O
My
writing
skills
were
increasing
and
I
enjoyed
the
progress
I
was
seeing.
In
my
kindergarten
journals
I
told
stories
about
things
that
were
important
to
me
like
my
parents,
my
sister,
and
my
dog
Shadow.
I
used
pictures
to
compensate
for
the
words
and
things
I
had
not
yet
learned
how
to
write.
This
inspired
my
love
for
drawing,
and
before
I
knew
it,
I
was
creating
my
own
comic
books
and
stories,
which
were
in
the
style
of
Dr.
Suess,
an
author
I
loved.
My
love
for
Dr.
Suess
books
turned
into
a
bit
of
an
obsession
and
I
began
my
own
collection
of
his
works.
I
loved
SuessOs
books
and
his
interesting
artwork
and
I
would
ask
for
his
books
for
holidays
like
my
birthday
and
Christmas.
In
fact,
when
I
lost
a
tooth,
I
would
write
to
the
tooth
fairy
asking
her
if
she
would
give
me
a
book
instead
of
money.
The
tooth
fairy
was
good
to
me
and
each
time
I
received
a
new
book,
I
added
it
to
the
bookshelf
in
my
room
and
made
sure
to
write
in
the
front
cover,
NThis
book
belongs
to
Barry.
I
got
this
book
on
May
15,
1997,O
or
whatever
the
date
was
at
the
time.
I
even
spent
hours
rearranging
the
books
alphabetically
by
title
or
date
of
release.
Although,
I
havenOt
read
any
Dr.
Suess
books
in
a
longtime,
he
had
a
large
influence
on
my
childhood
and
I
still
appreciate
his
creativity
and
short
stories.
From
this
point
forward,
I
continued
writing
and
creating
my
own
comic
books
and
stories.
I
often
showed
them
to
my
neighborhood
friends
and
wrote
them
for
my
mom.
At
one
point,
I
even
had
a
scheme
to
sell
my
books
and
stories
to
my
neighbors
for
five
cents
a
copy
and
tried
setting
up
a
printing
press
using
the
photocopier
and
a
stapler
in
my
parentsO
home
office.
I
donOt
remember
the
project
ever
blossoming
or
being
very
lucrative
but
I
had
fun
none-the-less.
I
also
began
making
greeting
cards
for
my
parents
and
friends.
These
cards
said
little
things
like
NI
love
you
mom,O
or
NHappy
Birthday!O
and
would
include
jokes
and
funny
sayings
to
make
people
laugh.
For
the
cards
I
made
for
my
mom,
I
would
slip
them
under
her
door
at
night
and
wait
to
see
her
reaction
the
next
morning.
The
cards
always
pleasantly
surprised
my
mom
and
I
liked
the
idea
that
my
writing
and
drawings
could
make
other
people
happy.
When
I
went
on
to
first
grade,
my
class
held
OtestsO
to
see
how
many
words
each
student
knew
how
to
write
and
spell
correctly.
The
class
would
sit
in
the
hallway
and
each
student
had
about
fifteen
minutes
to
jot-down
a
list
of
as
many
words
as
he
or
she
knew
how
to
write.
I
loved
these
exercises
and
I
excelled
in
them.
I
remember
always
coming
in
first
or
second
place
in
the
class
with
the
highest
number
of
words
written.
It
became
a
competition
for
me
and
luckily
spelling
and
writing
was
one
of
my
stronger
skills.
Once
I
reached
second
grade,
my
class
began
using
the
computer
lab
at
school
and
would
go
on
programs
like
KidPix
to
create
pictures
and
learn
how
to
type.
This
was
a
new
medium
of
writing
for
me
and
I
began
creating
colorful
scenes
that
included
written
captions.
I
enjoyed
typing
and
making
art
on
the
computer
and
I
often
printed
these
pieces
out
and
hung
them
on
my
refrigerator
at
home.
My
mom
saw
that
I
enjoyed
doing
this
so
she
allowed
me
to
use
her
own
desktop
computer
and
I
would
go
on
programs
like
Microsoft
Paint
and
create
these
works
of
art
from
home.
In
third
grade,
I
had
one
of
my
favorite
teachers
of
my
early
childhood
education,
Mr.
DiLeo.
Unlike
any
other
third
grade
class,
Mr.
DiLeoOs
class
hosted
a
haunted
house
in
the
auditorium
each
Halloween
and
a
spring
play.
Before
lunch
each
day,
DiLeo
would
line
the
class
up
outside
of
the
cafeteria
and
quiz
students
on
spelling
words
and
math
problems.
We
were
required
to
answer
the
questions
correctly
before
entering
lunch.
This
experience
was
fun
for
all
of
us
and
helped
me
learn
more
vocabulary
words
and
polish
my
math
skills.
When
it
came
time
for
spring
play
auditions,
I
tried
out
for
the
lead
part.
Although
we
were
allowed
to
use
scripts
during
tryouts,
I
memorized
all
of
the
assigned
lines
and
even
wrote
my
own
parts,
which
in
hindsight
was
probably
not
the
best
idea;
I
didnOt
get
the
part.
Even
if
I
wasnOt
the
best
actor,
I
became
more
creative
as
a
writer
and
even
began
writing
my
own
short
plays
and
television
scripts.
By
fourth
and
fifth
grade,
school
became
more
challenging
and
I
remember
taking
standardized
tests
like
McGraw
HillOs
Terranova
test.
These
tests
had
writing
sections
and
teachers
constantly
drilled
students
and
made
us
practice
timed
writing
of
short
essays
and
creative
responses.
I
donOt
think
anyone
in
the
class
really
enjoyed
these
tests
or
writing
samples,
mostly
because
they
took
several
hours
to
complete
and
were
timed,
but
I
always
did
well
on
the
reading
and
writing
sections
and
received
high
marks.
This
was
my
first
experience
completing
timed
writings,
and
although
I
didnOt
particularly
mind
doing
them,
I,
to
this
day,
prefer
when
I
can
write
leisurely
and
on
my
own
schedule.
In
fourth
and
fifth
grade,
I
also
remember
learning
the
basics
of
how
to
write
the
typical
five
paragraph
essay,
including
an
introduction,
three
body
paragraphs,
and
a
conclusion.
This
was
a
new
concept
to
me
and
I
put
it
to
good
use
when
we
had
to
write
our
own
research
papers
and
create
a
shoebox
diagram
on
an
animal
of
our
choosing.
I
chose
to
write
my
paper
on
the
koala
bear.
The
class
was
given
time
to
complete
research
in
the
library
and
we
took
out
books
and
took
notes
on
index
cards
and
sheets
of
paper
that
the
teacher
gave
us.
We
also
went
to
the
computer
lab
to
type
up
our
papers
for
submission.
At
the
end
of
the
project,
we
presented
our
diagrams
to
the
school
in
a
science-fair
type
of
environment
and
I
was
extremely
proud
of
my
work.
During
these
two
years,
my
teachers
also
emphasized
the
importance
of
writing
in
cursive
and
with
a
pen.
My
class
learned
and
practiced
the
cursive
alphabet
and
we
were
often
told
that,
when
we
went
to
middle
school,
we
would
no
longer
be
allowed
to
write
in
pencil
or
in
print.
This
never
actually
happened
and
I
still
hate
cursive
and
refuse
to
write
in
it.
By
the
time
I
made
it
middle
school,
I
was
placed
in
an
enriched
class
of
students,
which
was
commonly
known
as
the
Ne-class.O
This
meant
that
we
had
accelerated
writing,
reading,
science,
history,
and
math
courses.
These
classes
really
helped
me
develop
as
a
student
and
I
felt
challenged
by
my
teachers
and
my
peers.
In
my
sixth
grade
language
arts
class,
my
teacher
gave
daily
lessons
on
grammar
and
writing,
which
were
extremely
beneficial.
I
was
taught
essential
writing
skills
and
knowledge
like
the
different
parts
of
speech,
how
to
write
sentences
containing
multiple
clauses,
and
how
to
write
an
effective
essay,
complete
with
an
introduction,
thesis,
topic
sentences,
and
a
well-structured
conclusion.
We
also
wrote
in
a
variety
of
styles
and
were
required
to
construct
a
portfolio
of
our
writing,
which
I
still
have.
This
portfolio
included
pieces
like
poems,
fictional
stories,
research
pieces,
compare
and
contrast
essays,
and
personal
narratives.
One
of
the
largest
projects
we
were
assigned
was
a
ten-page
research
paper
on
a
topic
of
our
choosing.
I
chose
the
sport
of
lacrosse
and
wrote
another
OrealO
research-based
assignment.
Looking
back
on
my
sixth
grade
class,
I
feel
that
this
was
one
of
the
most
influential
writing
classes
I
have
ever
taken
and
I
have
retained
much
of
what
my
teacher
taught
me.
In
the
rest
of
my
classes,
I
learned
how
to
write
history
and
science-based
research
papers
and
reports,
something
I
had
never
done
before.
Over
the
rest
of
my
middle
school
career,
I
continued
as
a
member
of
the
e-class
and
also
became
interested
in
music
and
playing
guitar.
I
began
forming
my
own
bands
with
friends
and
writing
lyrics
in
my
spare
time.
I
had
never
written
lyrics
before,
so
I
drew
inspiration
from
bands
like
Green
Day,
Operation
Ivy,
and
Nirvana.
I
found
that
the
more
I
wrote
the
lyrics,
the
better
my
lyrics
became
so
I
continued
writing
and
inventing
clever
songs.
This
is
something
I
continue
to
do
and
I
am
still
very
much
involved
in
music.
In
high
school,
I
was
placed
in
all
honors
and
AP
classes
and
continued
to
develop
my
skills
as
a
student
and
a
writer.
In
my
language
arts
classes,
we
began
studying
canonical
works
of
fiction
and
were
often
assigned
book
reports,
academic
essays,
and
presentations
to
be
given
in
front
of
the
class.
High
school
also
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
investigate
different
topics
I
was
interested
in,
like
business,
photo-editing,
and
different
types
of
art.
I
often
had
to
write
papers
for
these
classes
about
said
topics
and
analyze
different
pieces
or
articles.
In
my
history
classes,
we
wrote
research
papers
and
handed
in
current
event
assignments.
For
the
most
part,
everything
we
wrote
in
high
school
was
completed
on
the
computer
and
was
handed
in
typed
and
double-spaced,
with
the
exception
of
essay
questions
given
on
tests.
Throughout
high
school,
I
also
began
writing
monthly
articles
for
the
school
newspaper
and
would
submit
music
reviews,
which
covered
albums
written
by
my
favorite
bands.
These
were
my
first
endeavors
in
journalism
and
I
liked
the
freedom
that
I
had
to
write
about
topics
I
truly
enjoyed.
This
OfreeO
writing
also
extended
into
my
art
pieces.
By
the
time
I
was
a
senior,
I
was
invited
into
AP
Studio
Art
and
was
required
to
put
together
a
portfolio
of
my
best
pieces
for
review.
Many
of
the
pieces
I
created
were
multimedia-based
and
included
text
and
poems
that
I
had
written.
I
felt
that
including
writing
in
my
art
pieces
added
a
new,
unique
dimension
to
my
art.
Upon
leaving
high
school,
I
felt
I
was
adequately
prepared
for
the
rigorous
education
that
Lafayette
College
would
afford
me.
I
had
written
numerous
types
of
paper,
prose,
and
academic
pieces
and
had
received
positive
responses
from
my
teachers
and
peers.
I
was
confident
that
my
experience
and
my
work
ethic
would
pay
off
in
the
college
world.
When
I
first
arrived
at
Lafayette,
I
began
as
an
economic
major.
I
soon
found
that
economics
was
not
something
I
was
really
interested
in
pursuing,
so
I
switched
my
major
to
International
Affairs
and
English
with
a
concentration
in
writing.
Through
this
course
of
study,
I
have
taken
a
variety
of
classes
that
have
allowed
me
to
develop
my
skills
as
a
writer.
I
have
written
everything
from
a
25-page
history
research
paper
about
the
French
revolution
to
a
creative
writing
story
in
the
style
of
Stephen
King
to
an
edition
analysis
of
the
autobiography
of
Benjamin
Franklin
to
various
music
reviews
for
the
Lafayette
newspaper.
In
the
coming
semester,
I
am
even
taking
a
class
on
screenwriting,
which
I
hope
will
be
very
interesting
and
allow
me
to
write
my
own
short
movie
script.
In
addition
to
my
recent
experiences
writing
at
Lafayette,
I
have
just
completed
a
ten-week
summer
internship
as
an
editorial
intern
for
The
Legal
Intelligencer
in
Philadelphia.
The
Legal
is
the
oldest
daily
law
journal
published
in
the
United
States
and
my
time
spent
working
for
the
company
has
taught
me
how
to
write
in
a
more
effective
journalistic
style.
Aside
from
the
music
reviews
I
have
written
for
my
college
and
high
school
papers,
I
have
not
had
any
prior
experience
writing
journalism.
Working
for
the
Legal
was
an
eye
opening
experience
and
I
spent
my
time
researching,
copyediting,
interviewing
judges
and
lawyers,
and
writing
comprehensive
articles
about
recent
events
and
trends
in
the
Philadelphia
and
greater
Pennsylvania
legal
environment.
I
was
essentially
given
an
insiderOs
view
of
the
daily
life
of
a
reporter
working
for
a
major
newspaper
company
and
I
feel
the
skills
I
have
learned
have
made
me
a
more
experienced
writer.
I
am
confident
that
the
writing
skills
I
have
gathered
over
the
years
will
make
me
an
informed
writing
associate
who
can
effectively
help
other
students
improve
their
writing.
I
am
excited
to
see
what
the
future
has
to
offer
and
how
my
writing
will
develop
as
I
continue
my
education
and
my
life
after
college.
