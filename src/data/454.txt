Literacy
Narrative
Not
unlike
other
writers,
my
earliest
writing
memories
stem
from
reading
at
a
young
age.
As
a
child
I
read
books
with
my
father
every
night
before
I
went
to
bed,
and
became
quite
fond
of
reading
both
in
school
and
on
my
own.
This
early
exposure
to
reading
caused
me
to
be
excited
about
reading
longer
and
longer
books,
writing
longer
words
and
longer
papers.
I
remember
the
buzz
of
excitement
on
the
playground
in
first
grade
when
word
got
around
that
we
were
learning
to
read
chapter
books
in
class.
The,
NNan
and
Maxwell,O
books
served
as
my
earliest
guide
and
teacher
to
writing.
My
writing
began
with
weekly
spelling
quizzes
and
exercises
which
gradually
became
longer
and
more
advanced.
While
we
read
through
the
adventures
of
Nan
and
Maxwell
in
grade
school,
we
learned
to
spell
words
from
the
book
and
took
weekly
quizzes
on
how
to
spell
words
like,
Nthe,O
and,
Nit.O
A
motivated
young
writer,
I
remember
being
particularly
excited
when
I
properly
spelled
the
bonus
word,
Nbecause,O
on
a
quiz.
Eventually
though,
these
words
began
to
form
sentences,
and
those
sentences
formed
some
of
my
earliest
compositions.
My
elementary
school
writing
actually
comprises
some
of
my
best
and
worst
writing
memories.
In
third
grade
I
was
thrilled
to
have
written
a
10-page
story,
one
of
the
longest
in
my
class.
Positive
comments
from
my
teacher
helped
me
to
build
confidence
in
my
writing
ability
at
this
young
age.
This
premature
confidence,
though,
led
to
what
was
potentially
my
worst
writing
experience.
In
fifth
grade
I
was
assigned
to
write
a
book
report,
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
decided
to
write
the
report
the
night
before
it
was
due
without
editing
it
at
all.
Needless
to
say,
my
report
was
of
poorer
quality
than
work
that
I
normally
turned
into
my
teacher,
and
she
noticed.
In
fact,
my
book
report
was
so
awful
that
she
read
it
in
front
of
the
whole
class
as
an
example
of
a
bad
book
report.
Even
though
the
teacher
didnOt
mention
my
name,
I
was
quite
upset
by
the
ordeal
since
I
normally
did
well
on
writing
assignments,
and
thus
learned
early
on
in
my
writing
career
that
editing
is
crucial.
Fortunately,
I
didnOt
have
many
other
negative
writing
experiences
throughout
school,
but
used
my
formal
writing
assignments
to
develop
different
writing
styles
and
genres.
The
most
common
type
of
writing
I
did
in
my
middle
school
and
early
high
school
years
was
the
five-paragraph
essay.
My
teachers
routinely
emphasized
the
importance
of
organization
by
utilizing
the
five-paragraph
essay
in
every
writing
class,
for
every
assignment.
While
I
did
complain
about
having
to
learn
the
standard
five-paragraph
format
numerous
times,
it
certainly
helped
me
to
create
organized
compositions
of
many
styles
about
a
variety
of
topics,
and
the
putting
together
of
these
assignments
did
prepare
me
for
my
first
major
research
paper
assigned
in
tenth
grade.
Much
of
my
tenth
grade
English
class
was
dedicated
to
the
process
of
writing
a
research
paper.
Our
class
spent
many
periods
in
the
library
doing
research
on
a
topic
of
our
choice.
I
chose
to
write
about
Multiple
Personality
Disorder
since
my
mother
was
taking
an
abnormal
psychology
class
at
the
time,
and
the
subject
fascinated
me.
Our
teacher
required
that
we
first
write
down
all
research
facts
onto
note
cards,
sorted
by
topic
and
by
source.
From
there,
the
note
cards
were
translated
into
an
outline
from
which
a
rough
draft
was
created.
I
remember
writing
the
first
draft
to
my
research
paper
by
hand
on
notebook
paper
before
typing
it,
a
habit
which
I
retained
up
until
my
sophomore
year
at
Lafayette.
Writing
the
paper
out
by
hand
helped
me
to
spatially
organize
my
thoughts
and
ideas.
Often
times,
I
would
add
paragraphs
onto
extra
sheets
of
paper
and
mark
in
red
where
they
would
fit
into
my
draft,
or
write
extra
sections
in
the
margins.
I
always
worked
the
best
when
I
could
physically
mark
changes
rather
than
look
at
a
computer
screen,
a
habit
that
helped
me
express
myself
both
academically
and
personally
in
writing.
In
addition
to
writing
assignments
for
class,
I
spent
time
writing
in
a
journal
to
express
my
personal
thoughts
and
feelings
throughout
my
early
high
school
years.
My
journal
began
as
a
pencil
and
paper
book
that
included
both
words
and
pictures
that
I
drew
and
eventually
evolved
into
an
online
journal.
At
first
I
was
hesitant
to
publish
much
of
my
personal
life
on
the
internet
for
anybody
to
access,
but
I
gradually
became
a
regular
writer
on
the
website.
While
I
did
enjoy
the
ability
to
quickly
access
the
journal
to
articulate
my
personal
feelings
in
writing,
I
soon
realized
that
my
journal
was
being
read
by
more
people
than
I
originally
thought.
Since
this
occurred
when
online
journals
were
the
current
fad,
and
since
high
school
girls
could
be
quite
dramatic,
I
decided
to
erase
my
entries
after
they
caused
some
unwanted
problems
with
my
friends.
It
was
difficult
at
the
time
to
delete
such
an
important,
personal
archive,
but
I
felt
it
for
the
better
so
to
keep
my
private
writing
to
myself.
After
that
incident,
I
did
not
begin
keeping
a
journal
again
until
I
studied
abroad
in
Belgium
while
at
Lafayette.
As
high
school
progressed,
my
writing
did
evolve
as
a
result
of
my
courses,
but
I
came
to
the
realization
that
my
strengths
lied
in
math
and
science
rather
than
the
humanities.
As
a
result,
I
opted
out
of
challenging
English
classes
and
chose
to
take
more
advanced
math
and
science
courses
since
I
wanted
to
pursue
a
college
degree
in
either
pharmacy
or
engineering.
Although
I
didnOt
realize
this
at
the
time,
my
work
in
these
classes
did
display
my
talent
for
technical
writing.
One
challenge
that
I
always
had
in
English
classes
was
meeting
the
length
requirement
for
papers.
I
understood
that
writing
quality
was
more
important
than
quantity,
but
teachers
assigned
length
minimums,
nonetheless,
which
I
routinely
struggled
to
achieve.
I
would
often
times
write
what
I
thought
was
a
strong
paper
with
sound
arguments
that
answered
the
assignment,
but
would
need
to
add
on
additional
paragraphs
just
to
meet
the
length
minimum.
Meanwhile,
I
never
struggled
with
writing
lab
reports
or
memos
in
my
science
courses,
but
I
did
not
think
of
this
as
a
writing
skill
since,
Nwriting
skills,O
were
always
focused
on
in
English
composition
classes
with
which
I
became
frustrated
and
opted
to
avoid
in
my
senior
year.
In
preparation
for
college
though,
I
was
forced
into
some
writing
endeavors
like
the
completion
of
a
graduation
project,
standardized
tests,
and
college
essay.
Despite
my
apathy
toward
English
courses
as
a
senior,
I
did
enjoy
and
learn
from
the
writing
that
I
was
required
to
do.
Both
my
graduation
project
and
college
entrance
essay
were
about
my
volunteer
experience
with
the
Special
Olympics.
I
had
always
enjoyed
working
with
people
with
disabilities,
so
volunteering
at
the
local
Special
Olympics
bowling
practice
was
a
wonderful
experience.
I
put
a
great
deal
of
effort
into
both
compositions,
particularly
the
college
essay,
since
I
wanted
to
make
a
good
impression
on
the
audience.
I
worked
with
an
excellent
English
teacher
on
editing
my
essay,
and
he
was
complimentary
of
my
work.
Additionally,
I
routinely
earned
high
scores
on
the
writing
sections
of
standardized
tests,
so
I
felt
confident
that
my
writing
abilities
were
sufficient
for
the
college
level
although
I
intended
to
take
only
the
number
of
writing
courses
required
to
graduate
while
at
Lafayette.
Coming
to
Lafayette
my
freshman
year,
a
prospective
chemical
engineering
major,
I
took
the
common
course
of
study
which
included
my
first
year
seminar
on
gothic
imagination
and
folklore.
Much
to
my
surprise,
this
writing-intensive
course
turned
out
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
courses
at
Lafayette.
The
course
topics
were
unique
and
intriguing,
and
the
professor
was
outstanding.
I
learned
how
to
write
critically
and
eloquently
about
topics
that
I
did
enjoy.
My
professor
for
the
class
was
tough,
making
numerous
critical,
intelligent
comments
about
all
of
my
assignments
from
which
I
learned
quite
a
bit.
Fortunately,
this
class
made
me
less
apathetic
towards
writing
courses
at
the
college
level
and
made
me
more
excited
about
writing
about
topics
that
I
was
both
knowledgeable
about
and
interested
in.
As
I
continued
through
my
freshman
and
sophomore
years
I
took
the
required
writing
courses,
but
was
unable
to
choose
other
writing
electives
due
to
my
inflexible
engineering
schedule
until
I
studied
abroad
in
Belgium.
My
courses
at
Lafayette
consisted
almost
entirely
of
math,
science,
and
introductory
level
engineering
courses
which
contained
little
to
no
writing.
Resulting
in
a
drastically
different
academic
semester
than
I
was
accustomed
to
was
my
decision
to
study
abroad
in
Brussels,
Belgium
for
the
spring
semester
of
my
sophomore
year.
Of
five
courses,
three
of
them
were
writing
intensive.
Even
with
a
full
load
of
academic
writing
while
I
was
abroad,
I
began
keeping
a
journal
again
for
the
first
time
since
early
in
high
school.
I
wrote
in
the
journal
almost
every
single
day
throughout
the
semester
as
a
way
of
recording
and
remembering
everything
I
had
seen
and
done.
Our
professor
from
the
college
in
Belgium
was
quite
ambitious
when
it
came
to
traveling,
so
I
am
glad
that
I
kept
a
record
of
what
we
had
done.
The
writing
helped
me
to
personally
remember
what
I
had
done
throughout
the
day,
and
is
now
a
wonderful
resource
to
look
back
on
in
memory
of
my
semester
abroad.
Unfortunately
though,
I
did
have
to
return
to
Lafayette
after
a
fantastic
semester
abroad,
and
was
welcomed
by
an
extremely
demanding
engineering
course
load.
Much
to
my
surprise,
though,
it
was
during
my
first
semester
back
at
Lafayette
that
I
realized
and
was
able
to
develop
my
technical
writing
skills.
One
class
I
took
was
my
first
chemical
engineering
lab
course.
This
course
was
mainly
a
writing
course
where
we
were
given
our
first
exposure
to
writing
formal
lab
reports.
The
class
involved
designing,
performing,
and
reporting
the
results
of
a
number
of
experiments
on
different
pieces
of
laboratory
equipment.
I
was
nervous
going
into
this
course
since
I
had
never
been
exposed
to
such
work
before,
but
mainly
due
to
the
stories
that
I
heard
from
students
who
had
already
taken
the
class.
I
was
told
by
numerous
seniors
that
I
would,
without
a
doubt,
fail
my
first
lab
report.
Both
professors
for
the
class,
while
excellent
teachers,
were
rumored
to
be
difficult
graders
in
order
to
show
the
students
exactly
what
was
expected
of
them.
As
a
result,
I
worked
diligently
on
my
first
lab
report
with
hopes
of
doing
well.
While
the
rumors
that
we
were
going
to
earn,
N30
or
40
percent,O
on
our
labs
were
quite
exaggerated,
many
students
in
the
class
were
disappointed
with
mediocre
results.
I
turned
in
my
report
confident
in
my
work
and
awaited
the
results.
I
was
pleased
when
my
professor
pulled
me
aside
one
day
to
return
my
report,
for
which
I
received
an
A.
He
complimented
my
writing,
and
said
that
it
was
one
of
the
best
reports
he
has
seen
from
a
student
in
a
while.
He
liked
that
my
report
was
thorough
without
being
excessively
wordy,
which
is
a
problem
that
he
notices
with
the
work
of
many
other
students.
I
was,
of
course,
very
pleased
to
have
gotten
positive
feedback
from
a
well-respected
professor
of
mine.
I
was
content
that
my
concise
writing
style
was
particularly
beneficial
to
me
for
the
first
time
in
my
writing
career.
My
professor
then
suggested
that
I
should
be
the
writing
associate
for
the
lab
course
the
following
year,
a
position
I
never
guessed
I
would
hold
while
at
college.
While
I
was
excited
about
my
potential
as
a
writing
associate
for
my
senior
year,
my
most
immediate
goal
was
to
obtain
a
summer
internship.
Since
my
dream
always
has
been
to
work
in
the
pharmaceutical
industry,
I
was
thrilled
to
have
gotten
a
summer
internship
in
the
clinical
oncology
department
at
GlaxoSmithKline.
I
was
excited
to
begin
my
summer
position,
even
though
I
wasnOt
exactly
clear
what
it
entailed,
and
it
had
limited
relevance
to
my
engineering
background.
It
was
a
scientific
position
in
the
pharmaceutical
industry,
so
I
was
eager
to
learn
first-hand
about
the
inner-workings
of
the
company
and
of
running
clinical
trials.
When
my
job
began
I
spent
time
taking
training
courses
and
reading
about
the
chemotherapy
drug,
Hycamtin,
that
I
would
be
working
on,
and
quickly
learned
the
importance
of
technical
writing
skills
in
the
pharmaceutical
industry.
Most
of
what
I
read
were
abstracts
and
full-text
reports
of
both
ongoing
and
completed
clinical
trials
using
Hycamtin.
While
understanding
the
science
behind
the
trials
was
important,
the
technical
writing
skills
were
crucial
to
communicate
study
results
to
others.
Not
long
into
my
internship
at
GSK,
I
was
recruited
to
assist
the
group
with
the
drafting
of
some
FDA
briefing
documents.
The
purpose
of
these
documents
was
to
describe
the
current
clinical
landscape
of
Hycamtin
used
in
certain
tumor
types
and
to
show
the
need
and
feasibility
of
conducting
further
trials
for
that
indication.
With
the
help
of
my
boss,
I
was
asked
to
research
recent
trials
and
to
write
a
review
of
them.
Included
in
my
draft
was
to
be
an
introduction
describing
the
need
for
further
studies
for
that
indication.
I
was
excited
about
being
assigned
to
assist
with
an
important
project.
After
locating
a
number
of
clinical
trials
to
review,
and
using
a
similar
briefing
document
as
an
aid,
I
wrote
a
short
draft
.
It
was
challenging
to
write
an
advanced
document
on
a
subject
that
I
was
still
unfamiliar
with,
but
I
was
confident
that
my
writing
was
thorough
and
concise.
After
review
by
a
medical
doctor
in
our
group,
the
draft
was
edited
numerous
times,
and
I
was
recruited
to
assist
with
two
other
similar
documents.
I
was
happy
with
the
positive
comments
that
I
received
from
my
co-workers,
and
was
equally
pleased
with
the
opportunity
to
have
my
writing
critiqued
by
a
number
of
different
professionals.
While
the
writing
involved
in
my
job
was
unexpected,
I
was
content
to
have
the
challenge
and
experience
of
writing
in
a
professional
setting.
While
I
have
had
years
of
experience
with
writing
for
both
academic
and
personal
settings,
my
career
as
a
writer
has
just
begun.
Many
formative
experiences,
both
positive
and
negative,
have
molded
me
into
the
writer
that
I
am
today.
I
have
just
recently
learned
of
my
ability
and
interest
in
technical
writing,
and
hope
to
develop
this
skill
throughout
my
academic
experiences
and
eventually
in
the
workplace.
