Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative
I
will
openly
admit
that
when
I
first
read
the
prompt
for
the
literacy
narrative
this
year
I
was
a
little
intimidated.
It
is
one
thing
to
discuss
oneOs
whole
history
as
a
writer
thus
far,
but
it
is
quite
another
thing
to
have
to
critically
analyze
and
evaluate
oneOs
writing
over
the
short
span
of
one
year.
One
of
the
main
ways
I
began
to
notice
a
difference
in
my
writing
over
the
past
year
was
through
the
essays
I
handed
in
for
my
classes.
In
my
sophomore
year
I
began
to
take
more
difficult
classes
and
really
began
to
focus
on
my
English
major.
The
first
semester
I
enrolled
in
two
English
classes,
one
still
at
the
200-level,
while
the
other
was
my
first
300-level
class.
I
had
only
taken
Spanish
classes
past
the
200-level
in
my
first
year,
so
I
was
not
entirely
sure
what
to
expect.
The
class
proved
to
be
very
challenging.
At
first
I
was
not
even
sure
if
I
really
liked
it.
Although
I
had
easily
achieved
high
marks
on
all
of
my
papers
in
my
freshman
year,
that
was
not
the
case
for
this
higher-level
English
class.
My
professorOs
comments
D
which
were
quite
lengthy
and
detailed
D
repeatedly
stated
that
I
was
good
writer,
as
in
everything
was
well-written
and
the
technicalities
were
correct,
but
he
expected
me
to
do
something
more
with
my
writing.
That
was
the
start
of
a
long
struggle
on
my
part.
My
professor
liked
the
essays
that
I
wrote
in
class,
but
something
about
my
longer
essays
continued
to
present
a
problem.
He
told
me
that
I
was
not
thinking
critically
enough
and
needed
to
take
my
analysis
to
a
higher
level.
This
was
perhaps
the
first
time
that
I
seriously
began
to
doubt
my
writing
capabilities.
I
wondered
how
I
could
possibly
be
an
English
major
if
my
essays
were
not
NAO
worthy.
The
struggle
to
understand
what
my
professor
wanted
and
react
to
literature
at
a
higher
level
continued
in
the
spring,
when
I
took
another
class
with
him.
Though
I
was
very
interested
in
the
subject
matter
of
that
spring
course,
I
think
that
I
also
wanted
to
take
another
class
with
him
to
prove
that
I
could
write
a
paper
that
was
up
to
the
standards
he
set
for
me.
Though
my
essays
had
improved
over
the
course
of
the
first
semester,
I
still
had
not
written
a
brilliant
paper.
Never
had
I
worked
so
hard
to
write
a
paper.
This
professor
and
his
comments,
along
with
being
in
the
WA
class
once
a
week,
helped
me
look
at
writing
more
as
a
process.
The
prewriting
and
outline
of
my
papers
now
took
nearly
half
as
long
as
writing
the
actual
paper.
I
really
forced
myself
to
evaluate
the
prompt
and
outline
my
essay
before
attempting
to
write
it.
I
also
finished
my
essays
early
so
that
I
could
discuss
my
essays
with
friends
and
other
Writing
Associates,
realizing
how
valuable
a
tool
the
opinions
of
others
had
become.
This
made
the
process
of
writing
stretch
on
for
much
longer,
but
the
results
were
worth
it.
By
the
end
of
the
spring
semester,
even
I
could
notice
a
marked
difference
in
my
writing
style.
My
professor
awarded
me
with
an
NAO
on
my
final
essay
and
told
me
that
over
the
course
of
the
year
my
writing
style
had
improved
dramatically
and
I
was
finally
capable
of
writing
at
a
much
more
elevated
level.
As
mentioned
earlier,
lots
of
time
and
effort
went
into
my
struggle
to
improve
my
writing
style.
Being
a
part
of
the
College
Writing
Program
definitely
helped
my
transformation.
Through
the
weekly
staff
meetings
I
was
able
to
hear
and
participate
in
general
discussions
with
other
WAs
and
Professor
Tatu
about
writing
at
a
college
level.
Writing
Associates
are
expected
to
take
a
different
approach
to
writing
and
reading;
it
is
part
of
our
job.
While
I
did
know
that,
since
I
had
a
WA
for
my
Freshman
Seminar,
putting
those
principles
into
practice
is
quite
different
from
simply
knowing
about
them.
Though
I
was
assigned
archiving
WA
history
and
did
not
have
a
specific
class,
I
still
worked
closely
with
students
for
Drop-In
hours
and
even
substituted
for
another
class
while
its
WA
was
ill.
Through
all
of
this,
I
have
learned
that
writing
and
reading
are
not
as
separate
as
I
had
previously
assumed.
While
they
are
not
the
same,
the
two
are
irrevocably
linked
together.
English
classes
throughout
grade
school
usually
focused
on
both
reading
and
writing,
recognizing
the
link
between
the
two.
I
remember
in
sixth
grade
my
school
had
separated
English
into
two
classes:
NWritingO
and
NReading.O
While
I
did
enjoy
both
of
them,
the
division
seemed
to
be
pretty
pointless,
since
both
of
them
required
a
fair
amount
of
writing
and
reading.
Thinking
back
on
those
English
classes
in
particular,
I
have
come
to
realize
that
while
the
main
duty
of
a
Writing
Associate
is
to
NreadO
papers
and
help
students
become
better
writers,
the
WA
also
becomes
a
better
writer
through
the
process.
Reading
anotherOs
work
lets
one
see
and
adopt
new
styles
of
writing,
becoming
a
better
writer
in
the
process.
The
interesting
thing
about
reading
is
that
the
more
one
reads,
the
better
one
is
able
to
write.
At
least,
I
have
always
believed
that
to
be
true.
The
more
one
is
exposed
to
writing
D
both
good
and
bad
D
the
more
one
is
able
to
learn.
If
one
is
continually
seeing
common
mistakes
that
other
students
make
on
their
papers,
then
he
is
less
likely
to
make
those
same
mistakes.
While
reading
othersO
papers
one
can
learn
from
their
mistakes.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
this
past
year
helped
me
grow
as
a
writer,
since
I
was
able
to
peer
edit
so
many
different
papers.
For
instance,
in
my
fall
300-level
English
class,
my
professor
had
different
expectations
for
incorporating
quotes
into
papers
than
what
I
have
traditionally
done.
Besides
meeting
with
him,
I
was
able
to
talk
with
a
friend
in
the
class
and
see
how
she
incorporated
quotes,
thus
learning
what
to
do
through
reading
anotherOs
work.
As
a
Writing
Associate
for
the
past
year,
I
have
read
and
critiqued
many
papers
for
a
variety
of
issues.
Once
I
started
doing
the
kind
of
critical
reading
for
others,
it
became
hard
not
to
apply
the
same
sort
of
analysis
to
my
own
papers.
After
all,
if
I
was
able
to
read
papers
and
quickly
find
places
that
I
thought
needed
improvement
for
others,
then
I,
who
know
my
own
writing
style
better
than
anyone
else,
should
be
able
to
use
those
same
principles
for
my
own
work.
Being
a
WA
has
taught
me
to
read
my
own
papers
differently
and
to
be
more
focused
and
aware
both
of
the
prompt
and
the
audience;
it
has
also
really
shown
me
the
value
of
peer
editing.
I
could
have
simply
made
comments
on
some
papers
that
the
students
could
have
used
to
correct
their
papers
without
a
discussion,
but
I
have
seen
first-hand
how
useful
the
discussions
are.
As
long
as
the
student
is
actually
interested
in
improving
his
paper
and
hearing
a
Writing
AssociateOs
suggestions,
then
the
final
papers
are
always
better.
After
watching
many
students
leave
satisfied
and
confident
that
they
can
write
a
better
paper,
it
is
hard
not
to
then
want
to
put
those
practices
into
action.
I
not
only
learned
the
value
of
editing
and
discussing
othersO
papers
but
my
own
as
well.
One
of
my
friends
was
in
an
English
class
with
me
and
was
also
a
WA,
so
whenever
we
had
a
paper
due,
the
two
of
us
would
get
together
and
NWAO
each
otherOs
papers.
While
both
of
us
were
trained
Writing
Associates
and
good
writers,
the
program
showed
us
how
important
it
is
to
hear
what
others
have
to
say.
I
know
that
many
times
I
would
write
something
that
made
perfect
sense
to
me
as
the
reader,
but
it
did
not
always
carry
the
same
meaning
to
others.
By
having
my
friend
peer
edit
my
papers,
I
noticed
a
marked
improvement
in
my
papers.
At
the
same
time,
I
was
editing
her
drafts,
so
I
was
not
only
getting
the
benefits
of
someone
else
reading
my
paper,
but
I
was
able
to
help
out
my
friend
and
learn
more
about
writing
through
her.
By
understanding
the
importance
of
discussing
my
own
writing
with
others,
I
also
asked
other
friends
to
review
my
papers
and
went
to
my
professors
many
times
to
discuss
my
essays.
In
the
past,
normally
I
preferred
to
write
and
edit
my
papers
by
myself.
It
was
not
as
though
I
did
not
trust
the
opinions
of
others,
but
I
had
a
strong
confidence
in
the
knowledge
that
I
could
write
passably
well
by
myself.
I
also
was
a
little
reluctant
to
sit
back
and
possibly
have
others
tear
apart
my
writing.
But
over
the
past
year
I
have
really
come
to
understand
that
writing
is
a
process,
and
as
a
process
there
are
definitely
going
to
be
some
ups
and
downs.
While
I
may
learn
that
one
paragraph
needs
to
be
completely
revised,
I
may
also
learn
that
I
did
another
part
well,
so
that
I
could
emulate
it
for
future
papers.
I
do
want
to
become
the
best
writer
I
can
be,
and
for
that
to
happen,
peer
editing
of
my
own
work
is
essential.
I
was
also
not
really
surprised
to
learn
how
helpful
the
process
was
and
how
much
better
I
felt
about
my
own
work
after
listening
to
another
person
affirm
parts
that
I
thought
went
well
and
other
parts
that
I
also
questioned.
One
of
the
classes
that
really
helped
me
improve
my
writing
over
the
past
year
was
my
VAST
class.
This
class
was
incorporated
into
the
curriculum
by
the
school
in
order
to
make
sure
students
were
writing
successfully
at
a
college
level.
Since
the
classes
are
writing-intensive,
they
all
work
closely
with
the
College
Writing
Program,
meaning
that
I
had
a
WA
for
my
class.
It
was
an
interesting
experience
having
a
WA
for
a
class
when
I
myself
was
a
WA.
While
I
found
my
WA
for
my
FYS
to
be
really
useful,
I
was
now
also
a
WA
taught
the
same
basic
things
as
my
WA,
so
I
was
curious
to
see
how
beneficial
the
program
was.
I
was
pleased
and
altogether
not
very
surprised
to
see
that
my
WA
and
the
program
in
general
was
just
as
helpful
to
me
even
when
I
was
a
part
of
it.
Although
by
the
second
half
of
sophomore
year
I
did
already
have
three
semesters
of
college
writing
experience,
it
was
beneficial
to
have
a
WA
once
again.
Both
she
and
I
knew
what
she
should
be
looking
for
in
my
papers,
so
in
many
ways
our
shared
knowledge
helped
facilitate
the
discussion.
I
questioned
her
about
things
I
was
able
to
see
students
ask
their
WAs
and
other
information
I
knew
would
be
important.
Through
my
new
writing
knowledge
as
a
WA
and
still
having
a
WA
to
help
me,
my
VAST
assignments
were
very
satisfying.
During
the
first
few
conferences
as
a
WA,
I
was
worried
about
what
to
say
and
how
to
act.
I
wanted
to
be
a
positive
influence
on
the
students,
using
our
thirty-minute
conferences
to
really
show
them
how
to
become
better
writers,
as
well
as
using
fruits
of
our
conferences
to
better
my
own
understanding
of
writing.
I
am
a
perfectionist
and
very
detail-oriented,
so
at
first
it
bothered
me
that
as
a
WA
I
really
should
shy
away
from
Nlower
order
concerns.O
I
felt
that
while
grammar
and
punctuation
may
be
considered
Nlower
order,O
they
are
still
essential
parts
of
a
paper
and
worth
mentioning.
When
I
started
giving
conferences,
however,
my
initial
thoughts
changed
drastically.
As
I
read
the
papers
and
noticed
the
Nlower
orderO
problems,
I
found
myself
concentrating
more
on
the
Nhigher
order
concerns.O
Like
people
in
the
program
said
in
training,
problems
with
organization,
clarity,
and
style
really
do
affect
a
paper
much
more
than
any
minor
technical
issues
ever
could.
The
higher
order
concerns
also
provided
the
basis
for
the
discussion
I
had
with
each
of
the
students
in
their
conferences.
After
filling
in
for
a
round
of
conferences
at
the
beginning
of
the
year,
my
mentality
towards
higher
and
lower
order
concerns
changed
completely,
and
that
definitely
affected
my
future
writing.
I
no
longer
focus
as
much
on
the
lower
order
concerns
of
my
own
paper.
In
one
of
my
English
classes
this
semester,
my
professor
liked
to
give
us
page-long
critiques
of
our
essays,
telling
us
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
our
papers.
He
also
wrote
some
comments
on
our
papers
themselves.
Not
surprisingly,
his
critiques
all
dealt
with
higher
order
concerns.
My
VAST
professor
also
liked
to
add
lots
of
comments
around
the
edges
of
my
papers.
While
he
did
mark
lower
order
concerns,
I
never
got
any
points
taken
off
of
a
paper
because
of
that.
As
college
students,
I
believe
that
we
are
all
expected
to
have
a
good
understanding
of
basic
grammar
and
punctuation.
Professors
are
not
nearly
as
interested
in
whether
a
comma
or
semi-colon
should
be
used
as
they
are
with
how
well
the
student
is
able
to
express
ideas.
I
think
I
have
always
known
this
to
be
the
case,
but
through
my
experiences
as
a
WA
and
with
my
professors
that
knowledge
became
cemented
and
has
altered
what
I
look
for
in
essays
and
what
I
pay
attention
to
while
writing
my
own
essays.
As
I
prepare
to
begin
my
junior
year
at
Lafayette,
I
see
a
much
more
accomplished
and
confident
writer.
I
have
always
considered
myself
to
be
a
good
writer,
but
I
think
in
the
past
year
I
have
grown
tremendously.
I
now
am
able
to
focus
on
specific
parts
of
the
writing
process
and
really
work
to
fine-tune
each
and
every
part
of
my
writing.
I
understand
the
value
of
peer
editing.
Writing
as
a
WA
has
definitely
been
a
good
experience,
and
I
cannot
wait
to
continue
to
use
my
WA
training
to
help
improve
my
writing
in
the
upcoming
year.
