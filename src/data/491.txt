Connecting
My
Hand
to
the
Paper:
Narrating
My
Development
as
a
Writer
Goodnight
Moon
changed
my
life.
While
wizards
with
lightning-bolt
scars
would
zip
through
the
channels
of
my
mind,
and
children
would
frolic
with
talking
lions
over
the
hillsides
in
my
imagination,
no
fantastical
story
would
even
compare
to
Margaret
Wise
Brownus
simple
analysis
of
the
visual
world.
Faced
with
such
a
bustling
world
around
me,
as
a
young
writer
I
felt
so
overwhelmed,
so
curious,
that
I
could
only
remark
on
everything
that
I
was
surrounded
by.
Goodnight
Moon
serves
as
a
perfect
example
of
what
only
nineteen
years
of
writing
could
teach
me:
any
form
of
expression
is
good.
Every
time
I
scrawled
thoughts
out
onto
paper
or
smeared
words
onto
a
finger
painting,
I
built
a
better
foundation
for
literary
expression.
From
a
very
early
age,
saying
rgood
nights
to
every
object
in
sight
meant
taking
in
the
outside
world,
and
finding
material
for
me
to
write
about.
Expression,
even
from
the
first
time
I
could
move
my
lips,
has
always
been
essential.
From
the
age
of
zero
I
found
ways
to
make
some
sense
of
my
world,
getting
ideas
across
in
a
makeshift
alphabet
of
rooss,
rgaass,
reeess,
rwaass,
and
the
occasional
snort
or
giggle.
These
sounds
were
then
recorded
on
the
walls
with
melting
Crayola
crayons.
After
they
were
written
not
even
I
could
make
sense
of
them,
and
they
remained,
to
my
motherus
chagrin,
rather
permanent.
As
a
triplet,
I
helped
found
even
more
perplexing,
secret
dialects
used
to
communicate
with
my
brothers.
My
brothers
also
turned
out
to
be
proficient
crayon
scribblers,
and
together
we
seemed
to
create
the
longest,
most
disorganized,
most
indecipherable
novel
ever
written.
Mose,
one
of
my
brothers,
was
born
with
a
profound
hearing
loss.
Because
he,
living
in
a
silent
world,
was
silent
for
so
long,
I
took
on
the
role
of
his
translator
and
advocate.
I
always
seemed
to
find
the
need
to
speak
on
behalf
of
both
of
my
siblings,
and
as
a
result
developed
into
an
extremely
social
person.
Finding
the
need
to
communicate
in
any
way
possible,
I
was
drawn
to
supplies
that
would
allow
me
to
connect
most
with
what
I
was
writing.
This
would
allow
the
paper
to
be
my
canvas
and
my
pencil
the
translator
which
could
transform
my
constantly
sprouting
ideas
into
somewhat
logical
phrases.
A
finger
drenched
with
paint,
a
half-eaten
pencil,
or
a
pink
highlighter
was
my
favorite
tool,
and
I
let
my
creativity
run
wild.
I
was
completely
uninhibited.
I
was
always
a
starter,
constantly
coming
up
with
a
new
plot
for
a
story
or
a
great
opening
line
for
a
poem,
yet
I
could
never
finish
what
I
began.
The
urge
to
start
something
new
was
always
too
strong,
and
I
resisted
forming
any
plot
lines
or
following
any
form
of
convention
For
example,
in
one
poem
I
constructed
at
the
age
of
six,
the
lines
read
as
follows,
rI
walked
with
my
dog/
She
turned
into
a
frog/
Then
Is.
There
is
absolutely
zero
closure
here,
yet
that
never
bothered
me.
One
of
my
favorite
endeavors
I
embarked
on
as
a
third
grader
was
my
series
of
mystery
novels
starring
famed
kid
detective
Abby
Berkowitz.
Abby
solved
tons
of
neighborhood
mysteries,
ranging
from
rWho
stole
Tabby
the
Catus
litterbox?s
to
rHow
was
the
Earth
formed?s
The
series
did
not
end
up
being
a
series
at
all
but
one
long
role
of
yellow
paper,
and
Abby
shared
a
peculiar
likeness
to
me,
save
her
rwispy
black
hair
and
dreamy
blue
eyes.s
This
rseriess,
however,
regardless
of
its
length,
marked
a
turning
point
in
my
development
as
a
writer.
I
began
to
sustain
thoughts
without
instantly
growing
tired
of
them,
and
instead
of
throwing
my
ideas
onto
paper
and
never
returning
to
them,
I
learned
to
read
my
work,
edit
it,
and
reread
it
again.
In
the
classroom,
alongside
cursive
lessons
and
spelling
bees,
my
writing
gained
focus
and
insight.
I
began
to
dig
deeper
into
my
observations
of
the
world
and
to
explore
beyond
the
obvious.
The
introduction
of
the
rfive
twusus
by
my
fourth
grade
teacher
focused
and
intensified
my
curiosity
and
I
began
to
constantly
ask
more
questions
than
had
answers.
My
young
fascination
with
the
rwho,
what,
when,
where,
whys
sparked
my
excitement
with
learning
and
founded
my
passion
for
research
today.
The
importance
of
digging
beneath
the
surface
and
forming
my
own
ideas
has
stuck
with
me,
and
regardless
of
the
length
of
the
assignment,
I
never
seem
to
have
enough
room
to
express
everything
on
my
mind.
Already
a
curious
and
adventurous
youth,
the
push
to
explore
and
investigate
sent
me
off
on
a
year-long
obsession
with
becoming
private
investigator.
Wielding
a
journal
in
one
hand
and
a
pencil
in
the
other,
I
bicycled
around
town,
interviewing
community
members
while
learning
about
the
history
of
the
town.
My
notes
were
impulsive,
choppy,
and
disconnected,
and
after
my
rinvestigationss,
I
hardly
ever
drew
conclusions.
For
me,
the
rthrill
of
the
chases
was
enough.
One
of
the
most
perplexing
memories
I
have
from
my
third
grade
experience
has
to
be
a
somewhat
traumatic
experience
I
had
at
the
schoolus
monthly
book
sale.
I
have
always
loved
horror
stories,
and
even
at
the
age
of
eight
sought
the
bone-chilling
thrill
that
goes
along
with
a
gruesome
tale.
One
book
that
I
desperately
wanted,
Short
and
Shivery,
was
intended
for
only
sixth
graders
because
it
would
rdisturbs
my
wholesome
third
grade
mind.
Naturally,
because
of
these
guidelines,
I
absolutely
needed
to
have
that
book.
I
casually
picked
up
the
anthology,
excited
to
read
my
new
discovery,
when
a
teacher
accosted
me
at
the
counter,
insisting
that
I
was
a
disturbed
child
to
want
to
read
such
a
book.
Not
only
that,
but
she
phoned
my
parents
and
scheduled
a
series
of
appointments
with
the
school
guidance
counselor,
citing
that
I
was
ron
a
downward
paths.
As
the
defiant
youth
that
I
was,
I
made
it
my
goal
to
read
anything
I
could
get
my
hands
on.
I
became
excited
by
the
huge
diversity
of
literature
that
was
available,
and
the
more
that
structure
was
enforced
by
my
elementary
school
teachers,
the
more
I
tried
to
defy
it.
Where
reading
was
once
a
chore,
it
became
a
passion.
As
I
poured
through
the
works
of
R.L
Stein
and
Emily
Dickenson
and
began
to
mimic
the
writing
style
of
E.E.
Cummings,
I
began
to
face
what,
at
the
time,
seemed
like
a
creative
nightmare:
form.
Whereas
before
I
was
able
to
perform
writing
assignments
using
my
own
special
recipe,
I
suddenly
had
to
give
my
writing
shape,
form,
and
the
most
dreadful
of
all,
organization.
I
thought
that
I
was
doomed
from
the
very
first
assignment
of
the
year.
We
were
told
to
interview
a
relative
and
write
about
their
life
story,
an
assignment
that
would
be
exciting
for
a
private
investigator
like
myself.
However,
in
the
small
print
under
the
summary,
was
that
dreadful
word
rorganizes.
I
had
to
rpresent
your
interview
chronologically
from
how
you
chose
who
to
interview,
where
and
how
you
conducted
the
interview
to
what
you
learned
about
the
relative.
Did
you
learn
more
about
the
person
than
you
already
knew?
How
did
this
person
react
to
your
questions?
Did
your
relative
ask
questions
of
you?
Organize
the
presentation
of
our
interview
in
paragraph
form.s
Needless
to
say,
when
I
presented
my
grandmotherus
interview
in
what
resembled
a
stream-of-consciousness
poem,
my
teacher
was
not
pleased.
I
received,
for
the
first
time
ever,
a
red
rSee
me
at
the
end
of
the
days
at
the
top
of
my
paper.
As
the
focus
on
organization
increased
and
the
ever-dreaded
red
marks
decreased,
my
writing
began
to
adapt
to
the
rigidity
encouraged
by
my
teachers.
I
began
to
transition
between
thoughts
and
form
well-structured
paragraphs.
My
writing
seemed
to
read
like
directions
for
assembling
a
refrigerator.
I
would
say
what
needed
to
be
said
and
then
close
the
door
with
an
unexciting,
suitable
conclusion.
My
writing
lacked
emotion,
and
while
my
teachers
were
happy,
I
was
not.
All
of
the
gusto
that
I
had
thrown
into
my
work
disappeared,
and
a
school
assignment
became
just
that,
work.
I
stopped
writing
in
my
spare
time
altogether
and,
as
my
comfort
within
the
conventional
grew,
so
did
my
embrace
of
technology.
In
seventh
grade
I
began
typing
class,
hammering
out
exercise
after
exercise
of
ra,s,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,
shift
semi-colons.
I
was
quick
to
learn,
and
the
structure
and
limitations
of
the
keyboard
increased
my
efficiency
even
further.
I
could
not
feel
what
I
was
writing
or
connect
with
the
text,
and
anything
could
be
forgotten
forever
with
the
click
of
the
delete
key.
However,I
could
not
operate
like
the
literary
machine
I
thought
I
was.
As
the
independence
I
was
allotted
by
school
increased
and
the
awkwardness
of
middle
school
intensified,
I
needed
an
outlet.
Suddenly,
the
feelings
that
I
had
pushed
away
were
headed
towards
me,
at
full
speed.
It
was
as
if
I
was
four
again,
feeling
out
my
world
for
the
first
time
and
writing
out
my
observations
with
the
flick
of
a
crayon.
One
poem,
rColors,
that
I
wrote
the
spring
of
eighth
grade
illustrates
this
transformation
perfectly.
rThe
blues,
the
blacks/
I
want
all
of
that/
to
feel
again
through
my
pen/
to
be
alive
for
once
and
forever.s
My
parents
recall
me
staying
up
through
all
hours
of
the
night,
writing
whatever
came
to
mind
and
completely
losing
track
of
time.
In
an
interview
with
my
mother,
she
remarked,
between
laughs,
that
ryou
would
stay
up
until
dusk
with
pen
in
hand,
and
even
though
you
closed
your
door
and
kept
quiet,
we
would
tip
toe
by
to
see
you
hard
at
work.
You
would
be
scribbling
in
the
corners
of
your
paper,
on
paper
towels-
anywhere.
You
became
our
little
Hemingway.s
As
I
began
to
find
a
niche
in
athletics
and
music,
I
found
even
more
material
to
be
excited
about.
I
stood
out
in
the
concert
band
and
jazz
band,
playing
up
a
storm
on
my
tenor
sax,
while
also
taking
charge
on
the
volleyball
court.
As
my
focus
on
school
began
to
wane
from
the
completion
of
assignments
to
my
own
creative
endeavors,
the
structure
of
sports
helped
me
regain
my
focus.
I
began
to
find
a
balance
between
creative
expression
and
structure,
and
when
high
school
began
in
the
fall,
I
seemed
ready
to
face
freshman
year.
High
school,
I
had
been
told,
was
four
years
of
independence,
discovery,
and
fun.
So,
when
I
entered
my
first
English
class
of
the
year,
I
expected
a
hippie
teacher
rocking
long
hair,
peace
sign
earrings,
and
a
muumuu.
I
could
not
have
been
farther
from
the
truth.
Instead
of
Yoko
Ono,
I
had
Barbara
Bush.
The
first
class
she
welcomed
us
warmly
and,
as
recorded
in
my
notes,
she
proudly
stated
that,
rEnglish
is
fun.
It
is
exciting;
it
is
a
wonderful
outlet
for
all
of
that
frustration
you
may
develop
from
your
siblings
or
your
chemistry
teachers.
But
to
be
good
at
it,
you
need,
first
and
foremost,
discipline.
And
with
that
discipline
follows
structure.s
For
the
rest
of
that
class
period
and
what
seemed
to
be
the
rest
of
the
year
we
focused
on
ever-dreaded
constructs.
These
lists
of
grammar
formations
were
divided
into
numbered
sentences
that
ranged
from
a
Number
One
sentence
to
a
Number
Eleven.
Number
One
represented
the
appositive,
Number
Two
the
series,
and
onward
and
onward.
By
the
end
of
my
sophomore
year,
I
had
almost
developed
a
numbered
rulebook
for
pleasing
the
high
school
English
teacher.
Rule
number
one?
Never
use
rIs.
This
rule
put
me
in
a
fascinating
position.
If
rIs
had
done
something
and
rIs
was
writing
about
it,
shouldnut
rIs
use
rIs
to
talk
about
rIs?
The
answer
according
to
some
teachers
was
simple,
no,
and
so
I
developed
what
at
the
time
I
thought
to
be
a
surefire
way
to
please
as
many
teachers
as
possible.
I
discovered
rones.
All-encompassing
and
never
gender
specific,
rones
could
take
the
place
of
rwes,s
yous,
rmes,
and
just
about
any
other
subject
I
desired.
rOnes
squeezed
me
through
freshman
year
and
even
most
of
my
second
year,
in
which
I
was
the
student
of
a
seemingly
rcanon-happys
teacher.
It
was
also
while
reading
the
age-old
favorite
A
Tale
of
Two
Cities
that
I
learned
high
school
rule
number
two:
always
follow
a
theme.
This
rule
would
be
nearly
demolished
in
my
first
college
English
class,
but
by
tracing
the
golden
age
throughout
Oedipus
in
my
junior
year,
I
was
golden.
I
learned
to
recognize
a
rloss
of
innocences
or
a
rfloods,
but
much
of
the
opportunity
to
truly
submerge
myself
into
the
literature
was
lost.
Instead,
I
felt
as
though
I
was
left
to
perform
open
heart
surgery
on
To
Kill
a
Mockingbird
or
The
Great
Gatsby,
making
my
own
textual
incisions
so
precise,
so
calculated,
so
confined,
that
I
had
no
room
to
explore.
Because
I
was
so
used
to
extracting
myself
from
my
work,
I
was
startled
when
the
first
assignment
I
received
in
my
college
Literary
Questions
class
screamed,
in
bold-faced
lettering,
to
be
sure
that
my
paper
rUses
tIu.
The
tweu
that
you
were
probably
taught
in
high
school
drives
you
into
the
passive
voice
and
clumsy
sentence
constructions
that
I
abhor!
College
writing
is
about
your
voice,
your
ideas,
your
arguments.s
Suddenly,
I
could
regress
back
to
my
years
of
curiosity-driven
writing,
of
writing
for
pleasure,
and
at
the
same
time
utilize
all
of
the
guidelines
that
I
had
packed
into
my
high
school
writing
rulebook.
I
was
to
focus
on
one
idea,
yet
I
could
make
it
my
idea.
I
was
thrust
into
the
driverus
seat
with
no
choice
but
to
go
full
speed
ahead.
Not
only
were
the
topics
more
liberating,
but
my
own
writing
process
began
to
take
on
its
own
form.
After
several
years
of
slaving
away
at
my
keyboard,
I
decided
to
connect
with
the
content
of
my
work.
I
spoke
my
mind
at
the
microphone
in
W.O.R.D.S.
and
began
to
connect
my
passions
of
music
and
writing
by
reviewing
concerts
for
The
Lafayette.
My
senses
were
piqued
as
though
I
were
a
young
child
again,
connecting
my
brain
with
my
hand
to
the
paper.
Although
my
First
Year
Seminar
seemed
to
enforce
the
laws
for
writing
that
had
restricted
me
in
high
school,
I
took
two
amazing
courses
the
following
semester,
both
of
which
fused
literature
and
culture.
They
demanded
exploration,
and
as
I
tried
to
answer
my
own
questions
about
culture
and
human
existence,
I
became
the
private
investigator
that
I
had
once
dreamed
of
becoming.
The
research
and
thought
that
these
courses
provoked
was
even
better
than
running
around
my
suburban
neighborhood
with
pen
and
journal
in
hand.
Finally,
in
college,
I
have
the
passion
for
writing
that
once
drove
me
as
a
child.
I
am
eager
to
take
it
all
in,
while
focusing
my
thoughts-
excited
to
say
rgoodnights
to
everything
in
the
room,
yet
addressing,
like
Margaret
Wise
Brownus
character
in
Goodnight
Moon,
everything
individually.
Whimsical
worlds
and
sensational
settings
may
tickle
the
imagination,
yet
the
real
world
and
the
answers
within
the
text
still
leave
me
much
to
explore.
The
grade
on
the
paper
is
not
enough,
and
I
cannot
stop
investigating
As
Brownus
red
balloon
floats
away
and
the
lights
go
out,
I
am
still
not
settled.
A
new
idea
is
always
aching
to
be
put
on
paper.
