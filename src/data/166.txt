Writing
Resume
I
hereby
write
my
latest
work
in
a
long
list
of
essays,
research
papers,
poems,
and
illegibly-doodled
thoughts.
It's
funny
that
such
writings
are
termed
"works";
on
the
contrary,
most
ideas
flow
without
the
effort,
the
exhaustion,
the
stem
encouragement
which
usually
accompany
"work."
However,
similar
to
a
career,
writing
can
be
both
enjoyable
and
tedious;
good
grades
and
self-satisfaction
comprise
the
salary;
and
sometimes,
with
overtime,
one
may
earn
a
bonus
introspective
insight.
Indeed,
one's
various
"works"
represent
a
"writing
career."
Thereby,
this
paper--my
latest
occupation--shall
be
submitted
as
a
resume,
if
you
will,
encompassing
highlights
from
my
first
year
on
the
job
to
my
present
profession.
My
earliest
attempts
at
legible,
sensible
writing
included
primarily
birthday
and
Christmas
card
greetings.
These
cheap
yet
cherished
gifts
read
nothing
more
than
a
simple
"I
luv
U,
granma"
or
"Mary
Xmas,
ma";
however,
the
reaction
was
always
pleasing.
Although
relatives
were
most
impressed
by
the
colorful
Crayola
array
of
letters
and
pictures,
an
occasional
"Roses
are
red...
"
bit
drew
loving
praise
and
gratitude.
Such
construction-paper
poetry
wasn't
necessarily
Shakespeare,
but
it
was
a
start.
The
second
grade
brought
cursive,
pens,
and
written
homework.
The
most
memorable
assignment
involved
composing
a
haiku--my
first
introduction
to
a
set
pattern
of
writing.
By
sheer
luck,
the
first
attempt
I
made
fit
into
the
syllable
requirement
of
a
haiku.
I
didn't
think
much
of
the
effort,
but
apparently
"A
Garden
Spider"
impressed
Mrs.
Hoffman
enough
to
be
published
in
the
school
newspaper.
Inspired
by
a
slide
show
from
Science
class,
the
poem
seems
corny
upon
retrospection;
however,
it
was
good
enough
to
recycle
three
years
later--in
another
school
and
another
class.
The
three-line
poem
is
still
engraved
in
my
memory:
"A
garden
spider/Ready
to
gobble
its
prey/Steals
its
life
away."
I
still
snicker
when
I
realize
I
used
"gobble"
in
a
poem,
but
it
seemed
to
impress
the
teachers
in
both
second
and
fifth
grade.
Later
in
the
fifth
grade,
I
realized
I
enjoyed
writing
after
completing
a
short
story
assignment.
Given
free
reign
for
creativity,
I
used
my
mother's
typewriter
and
misspelled
my
way
through
"Pass
the
Carrots
Please."
This
two-page
attempt
at
humor
portrayed
the
story
of
a
carrot
from
the
veggie's
own
point
of
view.
As
the
narrator,
the
carrot
showed
its
excitement
as
it
was
served
on
young
"Billy's"
plate;
however,
it
groaned
and
whined
when
its
nutrition
was
boiled
away
and
it
was
fed
to
the
dog
under
the
table.
I
couldn't
wait
to
hand
this
assignment
in
to
Mrs.
Connors.
I
must
have
read
it
hundreds
of
times,
becoming
more
pleased
each
review.
The
next
day,
Mrs.
Connors--a
rather
eccentric
and
enthusiastic
teacher--was
thrilled
to
read
one
of
our
assignments
aloud
in
class.
Naturally,
every
student
hoped
it
was
his
paper;
when
I
heard
the
title,
I
couldn't
help
but
grin.
She
read
my
writing
with
such
pizzazz
that
it
was
still
funny
to
me.
The
class
chuckled
throughout
her
interpretation
of
the
story;
from
such
a
reaction,
I
realized
I
enjoyed
making
others
laugh.
For
several
years
after,
I
have
had
younger
students
compliment
me
on
"Pass
the
Carrots
Please,"
for
Mrs.
Connors
continued
to
read
it
as
an
example.
The
next
major
writing
I
remember
focused
primarily
on
grammar--word
usage
and
diagramming
sentences.
Such
concepts
seemed
easy
to
me,
leaving
me
a
lot
of
free
time
as
I
breezed
through
homework.
One
day,
during
a
tiresome
lecture
by
seventh
grade
teacher
Mrs.
Maria,
I
jotted
down
some
ideas
about
satirical
newspaper
headlines.
I
even
wrote
the
actual
articles:
once
the
idea
came
into
my
head,
the
phony
news
flash
just
flowed.
In
my
free
time
that
night,
I
took
pen
and
markers
in
hand
and
worked
on
the
first
issue
of
"The
Inquire,"
a
color-illustrated
mock
newspaper
designed
to
make
my
peers
laugh.
Having
showed
my
work
to
Mrs.
Maria
in
the
morning,
I
was
allowed
to
read
it
later
during
class.
For
the
pictures,
I
held
the
two-page
paper
up;
for
the
stories,
I
enunciated
in
reporter-style,
pausing
for
much
appreciated
laughter.
Thereafter,
I
continued
to
create
"The
Weekly
Inquire,"
and
read
it
aloud
every
Monday.
The
ideas
were
easy
to
come
by--I
simply
watched
a
lot
of
television.
At
the
time,
the
Iran/Iraq
hysteria
was
everywhere.
I
thus
used
Sadaam
Hussein
as
the
butt
of
most
of
my
jokes.
"The
Weekly
Inquire"
advertised
for
movies
such
as
"Sleeping
with
the
Enemy,"
illustrating
George
Bush
and
Hussein
in
bed
together.
One
issue
contained
a
blank
article
in
which
a
story
about
Iraq
was
supposed
to
be
placed,
but
it
was
blown
away
with
the
rest
of
the
country.
A
special
issue
parodied
the
seventh
grade
teachers;
although
the
butt
of
the
jokes,
the
teachers
even
enjoyed
the
humor.
"The
Weekly
Inquire"
made
a
reputation
for
me;
it
was
hung
in
the
classroom
and
read
by
my
peers.
Students
even
wrote
guest
articles
for
the
paper,
hoping
to
see
their
names
"published."
Even
the
next
year,
the
eighth
grade
teachers
allowed
me
to
continue
writing
the
paper
"so
long
as
I
don't
parody
the
teachers."
Such
encouragement
from
my
peers
and
teachers
propelled
my
aforementioned
"writing
career"
forward.
As
high
school
dragged
on,
the
writing
became
much
more
serious.
Reports
on
novels
and
ancient
literature
comprised
what
I
can
recall
of
the
first
two
years;
such
boring
assignments
did
little
more
than
allow
me
to
practice
typing
on
our
new
computer.
With
junior
and
senior
year,
however,
came
the
most
memorable
literature
I
have
ever
read.
We
respectively
studied
American
and
English
works:
novels,
short
stories,
poems--the
most
classic
writing
by
the
most
renowned
writers.
The
segment
on
the
Transcendental
writers
especially
enthralled
me.
The
ideas
and
experiences
of
Emerson
and
Thoreau
were
amazing
and
thought-provoking.
I
began
to
jot
ideas
of
my
own
in
my
notes.
One
observation
in
particular--the
comparison
of
transcendental
ideas
to
the
movie
saga
Star
Wars--later
became
an
essay.
Because
I
enjoyed
the
subject
matter
and
the
research
involved
(i.e.
wathcing
all
three
Star
Wars
movies),
the
paper
assigned
was
more
fun
than
work.
I
found
several
perfect
quotes
from
the
Jedi
Obi
Wan
Kinobi
and
Yoda
to
use
in
the
paper.
The
essay
"Jedi
Transcendentalists"
thus
compared
the
transcendentalist's
pervading
Nature
to
the
Jedi's
omnipresent
Force.
At
this
age,
my
class
was
a
little
old
to
be
read
to
aloud,
yet
it
was
still
a
thrill
to
hear
that
Ms.
Prior
chose
my
own
paper
to
share
with
my
peers.
Again,
she
has
continued
to
read
it
to
subsequent
classes.
Senior
year
brought
an
emphasis
on
writing
poetry.
Although
we
had
studied
the
American
poets,
I
was
never
quite
inspired
enough
to
write
my
own
works.
However,
having
read
Shakespeare,
the
Cavalier
poets,
and
the
likes
of
John
Donne
and
Ben
Jonson,
I
found
no
problem
in
writing
the
assigned
sonnet.
The
correct
rhyme
and
meter
came
to
me
with
little
trouble,
and
I
somewhat
made
up
the
subject
matter
as
I
went
along.
The
final
product
was
a
true
sonnet--strewn
with
metaphors
and
double
meanings,
but
physically
adhering
to
the
set
pattern.
The
subject
compared
love
of
country
with
loyalty
to
a
promiscuous
woman,
being
that
America
is
open
to
new
inhabitants
and
praise.
Apparently,
Mrs.
R--
appreciated
the
idea:
my
assignment
was
again
selected
as
exemplary,
and
I
was
chosen
to
read
aloud
to
the
class.
My
most
memorable
writing
was
delivered
as
a
speech
at
graduation.
I
had
been
hoping
throughout
high
school
to
be
able
to
speak
in
front
of
my
classmates
at
our
last
hurrah.
As
valedictorian,
I
was
given
that
opportunity.
I
took
the
chance
to
do
what
I
did
best:
make
people
laugh.
In
a
conglomerate
of
witticism,
sentiment,
and
gratitude,
I
presented
my
speech
with
much
response
from
the
crowd
of
parents,
relatives,
faculty,
and
graduates.
Everybody
was
either
laughing
or
crying--I
couldn't
have
wished
for
better.
As
I
concluded
with
an
unexpected
yet
appropriate
quote
from
Devo's
song
"Whip
It,"
I
immediately
received
a
standing
ovation--indeed,
the
best
moment
of
my
writing
career.
The
subsequent
summer
contained
my
worst
yet
most
important
writing--college
entry
essays.
Having
delayed
enrollment,
I
hurriedly
typed
through
the
answers
to
questions
on
the
college
applications.
My
senior
summer
was
on
hold
for
these
essays,
so
naturally
I
didn't
care
to
spend
much
time
on
them.
I
knew
the
writing
was
terrible,
but
more
importantly,
I
knew
the
sun
was
out.
There's
not
much
to
say
about
the
essays
except
that
they
must
have
been
adequate
to
get
me
into
Lafayette
College.
Thus,
I
conclude
my
most
recent
entry
to
my
writing
resume.
This
weak
summertime
attempt
to
narrate
my
writing
career
stands
as
my
latest
occupation.
Although
college
has
brought
some
memorable
writing
experiences,
they
cannot
contend
with
the
present
weather.
Having
shared
with
you
my
resume,
I
will
now
punch
out
and
continue
my
vacation
from
my
writing
career.
