The
Important
Essay
About
My
Writing
My
first
acts
of
writing
often
took
the
form
of
destruction.
I
wielded
a
silver
crayon
against
the
base
of
our
wooden
table
forever
marking
it
with
the
letters
of
my
name,
and
a
scribble
intended
to
be
like
the
flourishes
of
calligraphy.
Later
I
took
a
pencil,
pens,
and
even
my
motherOs
rose-colored
lipstick
to
the
wallpaper
of
my
bedroom
adding
the
letter
OKO
wherever
I
could
fit
it
in
among
the
pattern.
Fortunately
for
my
writing,
my
mother,
rather
than
becoming
enraged
over
the
signing
of
her
table
or
the
coloring
of
my
wallpaper,
suggested
that
I
switch
to
paper
where
I
would
have
the
vast
open
space
of
the
blank
page.
As
a
result
of
this
intervention
I
made
the
switch
to
writing
my
name,
and
later
my
stories,
where
they
could
exist
without
the
confinement
of
the
wallpaper
patterns,
and
without
resulting
in
the
destruction
of
furniture,
walls
and
lipsticks.
As
soon
as
I
discovered
the
joy
of
putting
pencil
to
paper,
and
later,
fingers
to
keyboard,
I
never
looked
back.
From
an
early
age,
I
took
great
joy
in
being
read
to.
As
a
younger
sibling
I
heard
books
like
Maniac
Magee
and
The
Westing
Game
even
before
starting
Kindergarten.
My
desire
to
hear
the
stories
made
it
possible
for
me
to
sit
through
books
that
were
considered
age
appropriate
for
my
older
brother
rather
than
for
myself.
As
I
entered
elementary
school
I
aspired
to
create
tales
such
as
those
my
mother
read
aloud
for
the
two
of
us
before
bedtime.
In
first
grade
the
Glenside
Weldon
Publishing
Center,
also
known
as
a
large
closet
in
the
schoolOs
library,
helped
me
publish
my
first
work
of
fiction,
My
Cat
and
Me.
The
story
was
a
seemingly
true
account
of
my
experiences
owning
a
cat.
Of
the
books
that
I
authored
during
my
early
education,
this
first
one
was
the
most
deceptive.
Unlike
some
of
my
later
works,
this
cardboard
bound
creation
was
entirely
fictitious.
The
next
book
that
I
NpublishedO,
Zeus
and
Lyly,
would
today
earn
me
a
seat
in
front
of
an
academic
inquiry
panel,
discussing
whether
to
expel
me
or
place
me
on
probation
for
plagiarism.
It
was
essentially
a
slight
revision
and
combination
of
several
Greek
myths
from
a
childrenOs
collection
of
mythology
that
I
had
just
enjoyed
reading
from
cover-to-cover,
several
times.
My
third
grade
teacher
was
especially
determined
to
make
her
students
writers.
Under
her
guidance
I
authored
The
Important
Book
About
Me,
My
Dad
is
Special,
and
The
Important
Book
About
My
Mother.
I
loved
the
idea
of
producing
such
a
creation.
While
most
of
my
writing
in
school
was
nonfiction,
I
still
felt
that
I
was
emulating
the
books
and
the
authors
that
gave
me
so
much
happiness.
At
the
time
I
was
completely
enthralled
by
all
the
great
literature
for
young
females,
because
my
father
and
I
were
nightly
working
our
way
through
Anne
of
Green
Gables,
Black
Beauty,
The
Secret
Garden,
and
everything
we
could
find
by
Louisa
May
Alcott.
After
reading
one
of
my
books
at
the
third
grade
open
house
my
father
left
a
note
for
me,
NI
like
the
bestseller
you
wroteNmaybe
youOll
be
the
next
Louisa
May
AlcottNthen
people
will
read
your
books
at
story
time
at
the
bookstore.
Love,
Dad.O
Third
grade
was
a
very
creative
year
for
me;
it
was
also
when
I
authored
the
very
feminist
story
of
The
Night
Sindy[sic]
Gave
Me
Her
Light,
about
how
I
and
a
female
reindeer
saved
Christmas.
In
elementary
school
I
also
began
learning
how
to
write
different
types
of
reports
on
various
subjects.
I
always
found
history
fascinatingNwhen
most
girls
were
planning
to
marry
pop
stars,
John
Adams
was
my
first
loveNand
I
enjoyed
discovering
new
facts.
I
have
also
consistently
excelled
at
following
formats
and
directions,
and,
especially
in
elementary
school,
that
is
often
what
makes
teachers
the
happiest
as
they
read
their
studentOs
reports.
I
generally
was
given
praise
throughout
my
early
education
for
my
writing
style,
my
word
choice,
my
creativity,
and
my
ability
to
keep
things
organized.
I
was
then,
and
am
now,
and
awful
speller,
but
Microsoft
spell
check
and
some
vigilance
on
my
part
has
finally,
for
the
most
part,
saved
my
writing
from
that
handicap.
During
junior
high,
in
grades
seven
through
nine,
I
began
writing
real
term
papers.
I
learned
and
used
the
MLA
format,
which
was
really
the
main
focus
of
the
papers
that
I
was
assigned
to
write
during
those
three
years.
The
first
paper
I
ever
wrote
in
MLA
format
was
a
six
and
half
page
piece
titled
simply
NChild
Labor.O
As
the
title
implies
it
is
an
extremely
broad
paper
that
simply
brushes
across
the
surface
of
an
enormous
issue.
It
is
in
fact
rather
painful
to
read
now,
because
at
the
time
I
was
so
terrified
by
the
fear
of
being
thought
to
have
plagiarized,
that
I
cited
just
about
every
other
sentence.
Despite
my
dissatisfaction
with
the
paper
today,
I
remember
working
hard
on
it.
I
carefully
wrote
out
an
outline,
researched
in
many
more
than
the
required
four
books,
created
note
cards
with
facts
from
my
sources
meticulously
correlated
to
my
outline,
wrote
out
drafts,
and
edited
and
re-edited.
While
my
overly
anxious
citation
makes
the
paper
look
a
bit
of
a
mess,
the
paper
overall
met
all
of
the
specified
format
requirements
and,
because
of
the
extensive
outlining
before
hand,
it
is
organized
in
a
way
that
is
straightforward
and
easily
followed.
My
teacherOs
comments
on
the
paper
read
simply,
NEasy
to
read
because
it
is
so
well
organized.O
At
that
level
following
the
format
was
worth
three
times
as
many
points
as
the
content,
and
writing
style
was
given
a
token
five
points
of
the
grade.
Junior
high
required
a
few
more
papers
from
me
after
that
first
one,
although
not
many,
and
each
was
slightly
better
than
the
one
that
preceded
it.
I
slowly
became
a
bit
less
hyper-
vigilant
about
citing
for
every
single
sentence,
and
my
own
ideas
took
the
place
of
summarizations
and
rewordings
of
the
books
I
used
for
my
research.
I
continued
to
cautiously
write
out
outlines,
make
note
cards,
and
flawlessly
follow
the
format
dictated
to
me
by
my
teachers.
As
a
result
of
those
things,
mostly
the
third,
I
continued
to
get
positive
feedback
from
my
teachers
about
my
writing
ability.
Outside
of
writing
in
school,
junior
high
was
the
time
in
my
life
when
journaling
and
writing
poetry
became
important
to
me.
As
an
NangstyO
teenager,
convinced
that
no
one
in
the
whole
world
could
possibly
understand
me,
composing
poems
and
filling
journals
proved
excellent
outlets
for
my
creativity
and
my
hormone
induced
emotional
turmoil.
There
were
periods
when
I
filled
an
entire
notebook
in
just
a
matter
of
months.
Journaling
has
stayed
with
me,
and
it
is
still
something
I
rely
on
to
help
me
sort
things
out,
and
is
a
place
for
me
to
jot
down
ideas
and
thoughts
that
can
later
be
developed
into
poems
and
stories.
Poetry,
although
not
something
I
would
claim
to
have
any
skill
at,
is
something
that
I
have
enjoyed
creating
for
as
long
as
I
have
written
it.
In
fact,
in
tenth
grade
when
my
English
teacher
gave
each
of
us
composition
notebooks,
along
with
weekly
topics
to
write
about,
I
decided
to
challenge
myself
and
write
every
entry
in
the
form
of
a
poem.
That
same
tenth
grade
English
teacher
played
a
pivotal
role
in
my
high
school
writing,
and
in
my
development
as
a
writer
since
then.
He
was
a
very
ambitious
creator
of
projects,
and
he
had
very
high
expectations
for
his
students.
For
example,
he
created
a
portfolio
project.
It
contained
four
sections:
logs,
which
were
critical
evaluations
of
what
we
were
reading
for
the
class;
writings,
assigned
and
other
writing
we
did
on
our
own
outside
of
class;
reflections,
a
journal-like
section;
and,
inquiry
and
research,
where
we
wrote
about
topics
that
we
found
inspiring,
or
thought
might
spark
some
writing
later.
We
were
required
to
have
a
certain
number
of
writing
in
each
section.
It
was
a
tremendous
amount
of
writing.
I
loved
the
portfolio,
because
I
liked
being
required
to
do
lots
of
writing,
of
various
types,
rather
than
just
a
couple
of
papers.
I
also
felt
that
my
writing
improved
greatly
because
of
the
sheer
amount
and
the
way
we
wrote.
My
portfolio,
which
I
still
have
and
cherish,
is
an
incredibly
overstuffed
two
inch
three
ring
binder,
and
bulges
so
much
it
barely
closes.
I
was
quite
successful
in
the
class,
earning
OAOs
on
assignments,
tests,
and
for
my
final
class
grade.
I
also
pulled
the
only
100%
in
the
class
during
the
entire
year
for
my
portfolio,
making
it
a
NHall
of
Fame
Portfolio.O
I
covered
every
inch
of
it
in
poems
and
quotes
and
cartoons
about
writing,
and
I
wrote
more
for
every
section
than
was
required.
I
enjoyed
doing
it,
and
my
English
teacher
became
something
of
a
writing
mentor
for
me.
If
he
actually
tells
me
he
thinks
something
I
have
written
is
good,
then
I
know
I
have
written
something
that
I
can
be
proud
of.
I
purposely
chose
to
have
the
same
teacher
again
in
eleventh
grade
for
two
elective
courses,
Creative
Writing
and
Public
Speaking.
He
was
one
of
those
teachers
who
were
legendary
for
the
amount
of
work
they
created
and
assigned,
even
for
electives.
But
if
you
were
serious
about
your
work,
then
studying
with
him
was
worth
the
stress
of
the
workload,
due
to
the
benefits
derived
from
all
the
hard
work.
In
Creative
Writing,
at
the
age
of
sixteen,
I
wrote
my
memoirs.
We
did
do
some
fiction
in
the
class,
but
we
mainly
focused
on
how
to
make
nonfiction
writing
creative.
It
is
a
skill
that
people
rarely
bother
to
teach
high
school
students.
A
history
or
science
paper
can
be
well
written
and
interesting
to
read,
as
well
as
just
containing
the
basic,
required
information.
My
memoirs
were
only
about
eleven
pages
long,
but
it
was
a
fun
combination
between
my
previous
writing
and
the
new
connections
I
was
drawing
between
the
different
forces
in
my
life.
In
eleventh
grade
I
wrote
a
paper
reminiscent
of
my
first
eighth
grade
work,
Child
Labor.
This
one
was
titled
NFrom
Suffering
to
Suffragettes,O
and
attempted
to
cover
womenOs
history
from
1750-1900
(the
time
period
covered
by
the
class).
My
works
cited
page
was
actually
two
pages
and
the
whole
paper
was
a
rather
rushed
seventeen
pages.
This
paper
represents
for
me
two,
out
of
many,
of
my
worst
writing
habits.
First,
I
always
try
to
take
on
too
much
when
IOm
writing
a
paper.
I
make
all
kinds
of
connections
and
points
when
IOm
brainstorming,
and
I
cannot
bear
to
leave
anything
out.
I
later
wrote
NForty
Year
Wandering:
American
Women
1920-1960.O
Even
in
my
college
writing
I
often
realize
that
I
have
taken
on
more
than
I
can
actually
write
about
analytically
in
the
five
or
eight
pages
the
professor
has
requested.
The
second
issue,
which
is
perhaps
not
entirely
clear
because
I
have
not
listed
the
titles
of
every
paper
IOve
ever
written,
I
am
fixated
on
writing
about
women.
Hatshepsut
in
sixth
grade,
women
in
government
and
female
artists
of
the
twentieth
century
in
ninth
grade,
the
women
of
A
Tale
of
Two
Cities,
Golda
Meir,
and
the
previously
mentioned
two
high
school
papers,
are
only
a
few
of
the
countless
papers
in
which
IOve
found
a
way
to
focus
on
women.
This
second
fault
is
of
a
different
kind
than
the
first,
and
I
am
now
making
an
effort
to
broaden
the
topics
I
write
about,
and
explore
new
passionsNalthough
hopefully
that
doesnOt
mean
IOll
just
be
writing
papers
with
titles
like
NColonial
History
1600-1750O
or
NGeology:
Cambrian
to
Cretaceous.O
That
would
hardly
be
an
improvement.
My
high
school
writing
was
not
always
as
rewarding
as
the
work
which
I
did
for
my
tenth
grade
English
teacher.
Much
of
high
school
was
about
preparing
for
the
PSSAs,
state
assessment
tests,
the
SATs,
the
APs,
and
other
groupings
of
capital
letters
that
became
an
excuse
to
teach
format
rather
than
style
in
writing.
The
US
History
AP
test
has
what
is
called
a
DBQ,
Data
Based
Question,
and
it
requires
a
lot
of
practice
to
be
able
to
write
one
really
well.
The
DBQ
is
an
essay
question
followed
by
seven
to
nine
documents.
The
trick
is
to
incorporate
as
many
of
those
documents
as
possible,
without
making
your
essay
a
laundry
list
which
sags
under
their
weight,
and
while
remembering
to
include
your
own
outside
information
that
relates
to
the
topic.
The
documents
would
seem
to
be
geared
to
help
you
write
a
well
directed
paper,
but
this
is
a
format
that
you
have
to
work
at
to
balance
well.
So
we
spent
eleventh
and
twelfth
grades
practicing,
writing
DBQs
and
creating
our
own
DBQ
questions
and
documents,
in
the
hope
that
for
the
one
and
only
DBQ
on
the
AP
test
we
would
know
what
we
were
doing.
I
mastered
the
DBQ,
and
earned
fine
AP
scores,
but
I
hardly
feel
like
it
was
a
good
use
of
my
time.
I
learned
how
to
write
essays
for
the
AP
English
Exam
as
well,
but
the
strategies
are
not
really
useful
to
me
any
longer.
Despite
feeling
that
some
of
my
high
school
writing
assignments
were
to
geared
to
specific
tests,
I
did
feel
fairly
well
prepared
for
college
and
what
was
expected
of
my
writing
at
that
level.
I
was
somewhat
nervous
about
how
college
writing
would
differ
from
the
writing
I
had
done
prior
to
my
arrival
at
Lafayette,
but
I
feel
that
I
have
become
a
good
writer
and
have
been
well
prepared
to
meet
the
demands
of
writing
at
a
higher
level.
I
enjoyed
working
on
broadening
my
interests
during
my
first
year,
and
took
classes
that
required
all
different
kinds
of
things
from
my
writing.
I
loved
the
Literary
Questions
course,
as
it
really
helped
me
to
feel
more
secure
in
my
college
writing,
I
felt
I
was
learning
how
to
write
in
a
more
analytic
and
scholarly
way.
I
also
took
some
Geology,
which
was
a
new
experience
for
me.
Writing
about
science
was
a
challenge,
but
I
was
able
to
remember
what
my
tenth
grade
English
teacher
had
taught
me
about
making
nonfiction
writing
creative.
I
learned
how
to
balance
the
style
and
the
content
of
science
writing,
producing
papers
which
were
well
written
and
informative.
I
worked
on
focusing
upon
smaller
topics
and
really
attacking
the
issues
from
all
sides,
being
as
analytically
critical
a
writer
as
possible.
My
professors
were
more
than
helpful
and
provided
me
with
excellent
guidance.
I
also
enjoyed
being
able
to
write
about
scholarly
topics
in
a
manner
that
enabled
me
to
show
them
as
exciting
and
relevant
topics,
unlike
the
papers
they
forced
me
to
write
in
high
school,
where
imposed
papers
seemed
to
limit
what
I
could
do.
My
final
paper
for
the
Introduction
to
American
Studies
course
compared
todayOs
feminism
with
early
1960Os
feminism,
using
The
Feminine
Mystique
and
Sex
and
the
City
as
my
texts.
I
feel
that
it
was
a
well
researched,
well
written
paper
that
I
enjoyed
writing.
Also,
my
FYS
final
paper
was
all
about
peanut
butter
as
an
American
icon.
And
again
I
did
a
great
deal
of
research
to
create
a
scholarly
paper
on
a
topic
that
I
found
interesting
to
learn
and
write
about.
Those
two
papers,
and
all
of
the
writing
that
came
before
them,
enabled
me
to
understand
how
I
have
developed,
and
will
continue
to
evolve
as
one
with
a
passion
for
writing.
From
crayons
on
furniture
to
ten
or
twelve
pages
of
scholarly
and
critical
examination,
my
writing
has
been
an
exciting
journey
that
I
am
still
on.
I
am
really
only
just
beginning,
because
I
have
only
been
writing
for
about
15
years,
and
for
much
of
that
I
was
handicapped
by
my
limited
vocabulary.
I
cannot
wait
to
face
the
new
challenges
that
lie
ahead
of
me.
Helping
other
students
with
their
writing
and
editing
processes
will
be
a
new
way
to
experience
writing;
the
next
town
I
pass
through
on
my
writing
journey.
