Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative
2011
After
originally
being
selected
as
an
alternate
for
the
College
Writing
Program
a
position
opened
up
just
the
day
before
new
WA
orientation.
Not
expecting
to
have
a
position
when
school
began
I
had
given
the
idea
of
being
a
WA
little
thought
over
the
summer.
As
I
considered
if
I
would
accept
the
open
position
I
thought
back
to
my
WA
interview
and
remembered
how
nervous
and
uncertain
I
had
felt
during
the
mock
conference
portion.
However
I
quickly
remembered
how
smoothly
conferences
with
my
own
WA
for
my
FYS
had
always
run.
This
thought
reassured
me,
and
I
assumed
orientation
would
offer
me
the
training
to
help
students
with
suggestions
on
how
to
improve
their
writing.
After
orientation
however,
I
realized
that
there
was
much
more
to
a
successful
conference
than
simply
suggesting
changes.
Orientation
taught
me
that
the
best
approach
to
a
successful
conference
was
the
facilitative
approach.
I
realized
it
is
not
the
job
of
a
WA
to
tell
a
writer
what
to
do
to
improve
their
writing.
The
facilitative
approach
allows
the
WA
to
draw
attention
to
potential
weak
spots
of
a
writers
work
by
asking
them
questions
that
lead
the
writer
to
discuss
and
more
fully
understand
their
own
ideas
and
arguments.
Based
on
this
definition
I
imagined
a
successful
conference
would
consist
of
myself
helping
the
student
writer
come
to
self-realizations
about
how
to
improve
their
ideas
being
expressed
through
writing.
After
conferences
began
my
idea
of
a
successful
conference
continued
to
evolve.
When
attending
conferences
with
my
own
WA
for
the
first
time
and
not
knowing
what
to
expect,
I
had
always
sent
in
a
completed
draft
of
my
paper
for
my
WA
to
read
and
so
most
of
my
ideas
were
laid
out
for
my
WA
to
see
and
help
me
develop.
My
first
assignment
as
a
WA
was
with
a
FYS
and
I
found
that
most
freshmen
seemed
to
work
along
these
lines.
There
were
a
few
however
that
sent
only
half
finished
papers
but
even
these
students
simply
had
to
expand
upon
already
existing
ideas
within
their
paper
by
doing
more
research
or
simply
putting
in
more
time.
My
second
assignment
as
a
WA
however,
was
with
a
VAST
class
and
this
was
a
completely
different
experience
at
times.
I
remember
one
round
of
conferences
in
particular
about
half
of
the
students
submitted
about
a
page
or
two
draft
of
their
7
page
paper.
I
had
been
spoiled
with
the
freshmen
and
had
never
had
to
consider
how
to
run
a
conference
with
such
a
small
amount
of
material,
however
I
quickly
realized
a
conferenceOs
success
did
not
depend
on
how
complete
a
draft
of
the
assignment
we
had
to
work
with.
Students
were
submitting
papers
in
completely
different
parts
of
their
writing
process
so
I
simply
had
to
cater
to
whatever
part
of
the
process
any
given
student
seemed
to
be
working
with.
For
students
that
seemed
to
just
be
beginning
papers
I
simply
had
to
help
them
work
through
creating
ideas
and
possible
arguments
to
use
in
their
papers,
instead
of
further
developing
already
existing
arguments
writers
further
along
in
the
writing
process
had
created.
I
now
realize
there
is
no
set
prescription
to
a
successful
conference,
but
if
I
work
to
the
writers
and
my
own
facilitative
strengths
most
conferences
can
be
considered
successful.
As
no
two
students
are
the
same,
no
two
students
writing
will
ever
be
the
same
and
no
two
conferences
will
ever
be
the
same.
While
some
studentOs
enter
a
conference
ready
to
ask
questions
and
discuss
their
ideas
and
work
so
far,
some
are
more
reserved
and
need
more
prompting.
This
is
an
important
reason
why
the
facilitative
approach
can
be
so
useful.
The
facilitative
approach
is
a
very
flexible
tool
as
there
are
hundreds
of
ways
to
start
off
an
easy
conversation
about
a
writerOs
assignment
and
current
draft.
Many
of
the
theories
and
methods
we
discuss
in
weekly
staff
meetings
help
me
develop
the
tactics
I
use
in
conferences.
One
of
my
most
challenging
experiences
as
a
WA
could
have
been
solved
if
I
had
paid
closer
attention
to
DweckOs,
NThe
Perils
and
Promise
of
Praise.O
In
one
round
of
conferences
I
had
a
student
whose
paper
I
did
not
think
truly
answered
the
prompt.
For
some
reason
I
immediately
drew
the
students
attention
to
the
ways
in
which
the
paper
did
not
seem
to
work.
The
student
then
seemed
to
shut
down
in
their
responses
to
my
questions
and
statements
and
the
conference
quickly
became
very
awkward
and
frustrating.
DweckOs
article
discusses
how
studies
have
revealed
that
students
respond
positively
to
being
praised
on
their
effort
as
opposed
to
only
their
intelligence.
What
I
should
have
taken
from
this
article
and
applied
to
my
conferences
was
that
a
student
responds
to
being
praised
on
their
effort
even
if
it
is
not
perfect.
Looking
back
at
my
awkward
conference
I
realize
I
should
have
taken
the
time
to
show
the
student
ways
in
which
their
effort
had
paid
off
as
many
parts
of
the
draft
could
still
be
used
if
considered
in
a
different
way.
This
article
and
the
experience
taught
me
to
be
sure
to
think
of
how
each
weekOs
staff
meeting
discussion
could
be
applied
to
improve
my
conferences
and
to
be
more
careful
when
planning
trickier
conferences.
Other
theories
we
discuss
help
me
better
understand
the
process
used
by
the
student
writers.
One
study
in
particular
that
stuck
with
me
was
FlowerOs
discussion
of
writer
versus
reader
based
prose.
Often
when
reading
student
drafts
the
writing
is
difficult
to
follow
and
the
writer
seems
to
simply
be
presenting
many
ideas
in
a
somewhat
unorganized
fashion
without
any
explanation
backing
them
up.
The
writing
can
come
across
as
the
writerOs
stream
of
consciousness
as
opposed
to
any
significant
explanation.
This
is
what
Flower
refers
to
as
writer
based
prose
whereas
reader
based
prose
is
writing
that
not
only
expresses
the
writers
ideas,
but
expresses
the
ideas
with
adequate
explanation
of
the
writers
thoughts
behind
them.
After
reading
and
discussing
this
article
it
is
easier
for
me
to
recognize
this
in
student
writers.
Because
I
understand
the
process
behind
this
style
of
writing
I
can
develop
a
way
to
express
to
the
student
their
need
to
include
more
development
and
explanation
so
that
readers
also
understand
what
they
are
trying
to
say.
Another
important
use
of
the
facilitative
approach
is
that
in
a
way
it
allows
writers
to
self
diagnose
problems
with
their
writing.
I
have
always
found
that
I
understand
something
better
when
I
figure
it
out
in
my
own
way.
The
facilitative
approach
is
exactly
this;
I
am
not
telling
the
writer
what
is
potentially
wrong
with
their
writing
but
am
instead
asking
them
questions
that
will
help
them
discover
faults
on
their
own
and
then
helping
them
improve.
By
doing
this
the
writer
can
fully
understand
where
they
might
have
gone
wrong
and
can
be
prepared
to
fix
the
problem
in
this
assignment
and
any
future
writing
assignments
they
have
to
complete.
Although
there
are
many
uses
of
the
facilitative
approach
there
also
exist
some
limits.
For
example,
before
starting
conferences
of
my
own
for
the
first
time
I
had
been
warned
by
veteran
WAOs
that
although
many
students
respond
well
to
the
facilitative
approach
there
are
sometimes
students
that
will
fight
it
on
all
levels.
I
hadnOt
given
this
much
thought
as
I
went
into
my
first
round
of
conferences
but
I
quickly
realized
this
was
a
reality.
While
most
students
are
relatively
cooperative
and
willing
to
engage
in
a
discussion
every
once
in
a
while
there
are
students
that
are
almost
impossible
to
lead
in
a
meaningful
conference.
Many
of
these
students
simply
want
me
to
tell
them
how
to
fix
their
paper
instead
of
helping
them
understand
potential
problems
and
develop
a
plan
to
improve
their
writing
themselves.
Conferences
such
as
these
become
difficult
and
uncomfortable
as
the
facilitative
approach
reaches
a
limit.
The
facilitative
approach
calls
for
the
WA
and
the
student
to
engage
in
a
conversation
to
further
the
students
understanding
of
their
own
writing,
however
if
a
student
will
not
give
more
than
a
yes
or
no
answer
the
conversation
is
not
going
to
go
anywhere
fast.
In
conferences
such
as
these
I
end
up
doing
most
of
the
talking
and
simply
have
to
address
parts
of
the
studentOs
paper
offering
a
series
of
suggestions
to
improve
the
paper
instead
of
being
able
to
discuss
their
present
ideas
and
help
them
come
to
their
own
conclusions.
These
conferences
are
so
frustrating
not
only
because
the
student
doesnOt
seem
to
want
to
give
me
the
time
of
day,
but
also
because
in
a
way
I
sometimes
feel
that
I
am
letting
the
student
writer
down
by
not
being
able
to
help
them
further
their
writing
process.
Working
with
others
so
closely
on
their
writing
and
attending
weekly
staff
meetings
dedicated
to
discussing
writing
styles
and
process
has
had
a
noticeable
effect
on
my
own
writing
process.
I
have
always
written
a
rough
outline
of
my
ideas
for
an
assignment
before
I
begin
any
actual
writing.
However,
even
with
an
outline
I
have
a
tendency
to
write
papers
completely
out
of
order,
jumping
from
paragraph
to
paragraph
as
new
ideas
come
to
me.
Needless
to
say
my
writing
often
has
a
long
editing
process
as
the
first
draft
tends
to
be
a
little
all
over
the
place.
In
our
weekly
staff
meetings
we
identify
methods
some
writers
use
and
discuss
theories
and
studies
on
how
best
to
help
writers
using
the
facilitative
approach.
Not
only
do
these
meetings
help
me
when
going
through
conferences,
but
they
also
help
me
with
my
own
writing
style
and
process.
As
I
now
have
an
understanding
of
possible
writers
problems
and
know
theories
on
how
to
best
approach
these
problems,
I
can
recognize
them
in
my
own
writing
and
address
the
issues.
For
example,
as
I
discussed
earlier
FlowerOs
discussion
of
writer
and
reader
based
prose
helps
me
when
going
through
students
writing.
Because
I
tend
to
write
out
of
order
my
writing
becomes
more
of
a
stream
of
consciousness
of
my
thoughts
as
opposed
to
a
logical
explanation
of
my
ideas
to
the
reader.
FlowerOs
and
our
staff
meeting
discussions
allowed
me
to
see
this
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing.
I
used
to
be
frustrated
thinking
I
was
making
more
work
for
myself
writing
in
a
writer
based
prose
fashion,
however
I
can
now
see
how
writer
based
prose
can
be
used
to
my
advantage.
While
this
style
of
writing
does
not
express
my
ideas
to
the
reader,
it
does
allow
me
to
get
my
ideas
down
on
paper
so
I
know
what
I
actually
want
to
say.
I
have
to
use
this
writing
to
my
advantage
by
reorganizing
it
in
a
way
that
better
expresses
my
arguments
for
a
reader
to
understand.
After
coming
to
this
realization
a
few
parts
of
my
writing
process
have
evolved.
For
example,
I
now
donOt
waste
time
trying
to
perfect
different
parts
of
my
paper
as
I
go
along.
Instead
IOll
express
my
ideas
in
writer
based
prose
form
until
I
get
all
of
my
ideas
down
on
paper.
Then
I
open
a
new
word
document
and
reorganize,
edit
and
add
to
my
writing
by
rewriting
my
writer
based
prose
into
a
reader
based
prose
form.
Conferences
themselves
have
also
had
an
impact
on
my
writing
process.
After
my
FYS
I
didnOt
think
much
about
the
college
writing
program
until
I
decided
to
apply
to
become
a
WA.
Since
becoming
a
WA
I
have
truly
began
to
realize
the
impact
simply
talking
my
ideas
out
to
another
person
can
have
on
my
writing.
Last
semester
in
particular
I
often
found
myself
describing
assignments
to
my
roommate
and
trying
to
explain
my
arguments
main
points
to
see
if
she
understood
the
ideas
I
was
trying
to
get
across.
Just
as
in
a
conference
this
allows
me
to
have
her
question
my
thoughts
to
see
if
anythingOs
unclear
so
I
can
make
my
arguments
stronger.
On
a
regular
basis
I
am
able
to
read
through
and
discuss
the
process
others
use
to
convey
their
opinions
or
information
through
writing.
I
have
had
many
discussions
with
students
in
conferences
comparing
my
process
to
theirs
as
we
work
on
improving
their
papers.
Often
times
when
IOm
writing
a
paper
now
I
think
back
to
a
recent
conference
and
try
another
students
method
to
see
how
it
works
for
me.
Before
becoming
a
WA
writing
was
just
something
I
was
assigned
to
do
for
class.
Now
I
have
an
appreciation
for
writing
as
I
realize
what
a
process
it
truly
is
to
produce
a
piece
of
writing
that
fully
expresses
a
writerOs
thoughts
and
ideas
well.
I
am
glad
that
I
have
been
trained
in
the
facilitative
approach
and
I
am
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
help
other
writers
as
they
strive
to
improve.
