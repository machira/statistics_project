WA
Essay
My
History
as
a
Writer
I
cannot
imagine
anything
more
complicated
to
explain
than
my
relationship
with
writing.
It
was
very
passionate
from
the
very
start.
There
were
many
fights
and
struggles
involved,
some
of
which
ended
in
victories,
others
in
defeats,
but
most
of
them
are
yet
to
be
solved.
My
first
great
victory
was
actually
a
victory
against
writing.
During
my
first
grade,
after
I
began
to
scribble
my
first
words,
my
parents
and
my
teacher
reached
an
agreement
that
they
should
do
something
about
my
especially
awful
handwriting.
They
came
up
with
one
way
of
helping
me.
Every
day
in
the
evening
I
had
to
rewrite
paragraphs
from
books
or
newspapers,
and
to
do
that
as
nicely
as
I
could.
What
a
brilliant
idea!
But
there
were
two
things
wrong
with
it.
First,
this
way
of
helping
me
involved
a
lot
more
me-helping-myself
than
others-helping-me.
Second,
writing
as
nicely
as
I
thought
I
could
was
not
as
nicely
as
my
parents
thought
I
could,
so
by
doing
this
extra
amount
of
work
I
was
usually
punished
for
not
trying
enough
to
do
it
better.
This
routine
was
not
tolerable
for
a
nervous
and
naughty
six-year-old,
so
I
devised
my
own
strategy
for
helping
my
parents
realize
that
their
way
of
helping
me
was
not
any
good
for
helping
anyone.
The
enthusiasm
that
I
saved
in
my
handwriting
practices
was
used
in
a
restless
battle
against
all
the
writing
equipment
in
the
house.
For
a
couple
of
weeks
all
the
pens,
pencils
and
ballpoint
pens
in
our
apartment
faced
a
genocide
that
would
have
ended
with
a
complete
extinction,
had
my
parents
not
decided
to
give
up
their
campaign.
Happy
with
my
victory,
even
today
I
keep
on
scaring
people
with
my
terrible
handwriting.
Obviously,
I
hated
writing
when
I
was
a
kid;
sometimes
I
still
do,
but
that
does
not
interfere
with
the
strongest
and
most
enduring
of
the
dreams
I
have
ever
had:
to
be
a
writer.
I
used
not
to
think
it
was
a
dream,
rather
an
obsession
and
the
more
I
tried
to
resist
it
the
more
it
bothered
me.
I
have
always
been
a
book
person,
but
that
is
not
the
reason
why
I
wanted
to
write.
This
call
to
write
comes
from
a
deeper
psychological
subconscious.
It
has
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
my
family
moved
so
much
that
I
had
to
change
schools
almost
every
two
years,
which
brought
up
in
me
a
very
individualistic
approach
to
life.
It
is
also
important
that
for
some
unknown
genetic
reason
my
puberty
glands
started
producing
male
hormones
three
years
later
than
normal,
making
me
an
outcast
in
my
own
age
group.
The
passions
are
even
more
strengthened
by
the
rebellious
feeling
I
have
for
my
authoritative
father
who
wants
me
to
be
a
businessman.
There
is
also
a
nostalgia
that
I
feel
in
the
US
for
my
Lithuanian
mother
tongue.
All
of
those
factors
mixed
up
not
only
made
me
crave
to
write,
but
also
produced
the
personality
that
I
have
now
and
the
contradictions
in
it
that
I
still
have
not
solved
completely.
But
I
guess
this
essay
is
not
supposed
to
be
a
psychological
self-analysis
so
this
one
paragraph
is
probably
enough
about
the
complicated
part.
My
first
big
step
in
learning
to
write
was
when
I
was
about
fifteen.
I
started
dabbling
in
probably
the
most
important
and
popular
genre
in
literature,
which
is
the
starting
point
and
often
the
background
for
many
great
writers
and
their
most
inspired
works.
It
was,
of
course,
a
letter.
At
that
time
I
was
reading
a
lot
of
H.
Hess,
E.
M.
Remarque
and
J.
London.
I
have
read
everything
by
all
three
of
them.
In
this
mood
of
irritated
imagination
and
romantic
ideals
in
my
blood,
I
had
a
pen
pal
who
was
a
girl,
named
Marta.
She
was
a
very
sensitive
and
artistic
person,
which
was
completely
enough
for
me
to
fall
in
love.
This
relationship
started
with
letters
and,
through
a
period
of
almost
three
years
(with
some
interruptions)
until
it
finally
died
out,
was
very
much
based
on
letters.
It
seems
a
little
awkward
to
me
now,
but
it
was
always
very
natural
before.
I
used
to
write
reply
letters
to
Marta
during
the
classes
at
school,
or
at
night
in
my
bed,
or
very
often
I
would
just
think
about
them
while
walking
in
the
street.
I
created
a
lot
more
letters
in
my
head
than
I
actually
wrote;
I
wrote
a
lot
more
than
I
sent
out.
It
was
a
daily
activity.
I
was
a
guy
who
would
have
never
written
a
diary,
but
my
writing
in
these
mystique
letters
reached
a
level
of
intimacy
and
intensity
that
a
diary
would
never
have.
Because
of
the
letters
to
Marta
my
writing
in
class
improved
tremendously.
It
stopped
being
artificial
to
me.
I
just
started
making
every
class
assignment
as
personal
as
it
could
be,
as
if
it
was
just
another
letter.
And
it
worked.
The
teachers
felt
it
and
they
liked
it.
The
change
in
my
life
that
was
probably
most
important
to
my
writing
was
a
decision
to
study
abroad,
specifically
in
the
US.
My
last
two
years
in
high
school
I
studied
in
an
International
Baccalaureate
class
in
English.
The
teachers
were
Lithuanian,
but
the
programs
were
not.
So
I
could
compare
the
Lithuanian
education
system
with
the
foreign
one,
which
was
a
lot
more
advanced.
IB
gave
me
a
very
critical
perspective
on
the
education
in
Lithuania,
especially
the
universities,
which
were
still
stuck
in
time
and
ideology
of
thirty
years
ago.
There
were
many
reforms
that
still
needed
to
be
done
in
transition
from
communism.
I
did
not
want
to
stay
in
this
system,
so
I
decided
to
go
study
abroad,
which
was
still
a
very
new
and
challenging
idea
in
Lithuania.
The
decision
was
easy
compared
to
the
work
that
needed
to
be
done
in
order
to
make
it
true.
There
was
very
little
outside
help
and
information
available,
so
I
had
to
do
all
the
work
independently,
starting
with
completely
nothing
but
the
idea
of
a
possibility
of
studying
abroad.
It
was
just
the
Internet
and
I.
During
those
last
two
years
of
high
school
I
spent
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
hours
researching
the
education
systems
and
schools
in
Europe
and
the
US.
Later
I
talked
my
friend
Rytis
into
the
business,
so
finally
there
were
two
of
us.
We
decided
that
the
US
liberal
arts
colleges
offer
the
best
options,
so
we
successfully
went
through
all
the
application
process.
After
that
we
were
two
best
experts
on
the
subject
of
study
abroad
in
the
country.
Please
excuse
me
for
giving
you
all
these
details,
but
I
think
they
are
important
in
order
to
understand
what
happened
next.
After
the
application
process
my
friend
Rytis
and
I
found
ourselves
with
a
huge
amount
of
rare
knowledge,
which
was
not
useful
for
us
anymore.
We
thought
that
we
should
write
it
all
down
and
get
it
published,
so
that
the
other
smart
kids
could
use
it,
and
so
that
they
would
not
need
to
spend
their
nights
browsing
the
Internet
like
we
did.
It
started
out
as
a
joke,
but
in
a
little
more
than
half
a
year
this
joke
turned
into
a
book
on
my
shelf.
We
decided
to
write
it
particularly
on
study
abroad,
especially
the
US.
There
was
nothing
close
to
that
in
the
country.
First,
we
investigated
the
situation
with
a
series
of
newspaper
articles
about
the
education
system
in
Lithuania
and
abroad.
The
four
articles
got
published
in
the
second
largest
newspaper
in
the
country
and
were
successful
enough
for
us
to
continue
working.
We
contacted
the
publishers
and
we
were
surprised
by
the
enthusiasm
with
witch
they
welcomed
our
ideas.
After
a
couple
interviews
we
had
a
contract
with
NBaltos
Lankos,O
one
of
the
most
important
publishers
in
Lithuania.
The
book
had
to
involve
descriptions
of
the
university
education
in
the
US
and
Europe,
as
well
as
our
own
experiences
in
the
application
process.
The
recommendations
for
the
students
who
would
choose
our
path
and
the
critique
of
the
Lithuania
education
system
were
the
key
topics.
We
did
some
experimentation
on
the
style
and
tone
of
the
book
first.
In
the
end
we
came
up
with
a
very
humorous,
ironic
and
catchy
language,
which
was
close
to
the
everyday
speech
that
the
students
used
in
school.
Although
we
were
two
authors
the
voice
was
in
the
first
person
singular.
This
way
we
created
a
personality
behind
the
text.
This
character
of
an
imaginary
author
was
able
to
have
a
lot
sharper
opinions
than
we
would
be
comfortable
with
ourselves.
Therefore,
the
attitude
of
the
book
had
a
strong
flavor
of
NI
know
it
all
better
than
anyone
else.O
The
book
seemed
to
be
written
by
a
young
rebellious
person,
but
who
had
a
lot
of
knowledge
and
confidence.
That
was
a
character
that
we
wanted,
because
we
knew
that
the
audience
of
the
book
would
be
the
students
like
us
who
wanted
more
of
education
than
their
teachers
and
professors
were
providing.
We
also
acknowledged
that
there
would
be
plenty
of
people
angered
by
the
book,
especially
those
more
nationalistic
in
the
elder
generations,
because
the
book
was
openly
instigating
the
brain
drain
from
Lithuania.
But
we
wanted
to
anger
them!
Even
the
title
of
the
book
had
a
character.
The
translation
would
be
N$150,000
Worth
Book,O
which
was
the
cost
of
a
US
college
for
four
years.
It
sounded
a
little
ironic
two,
because
the
book
cost
barely
$5
in
Lithuania.
Despite
the
casual
tone
of
the
book,
otherwise
it
was
very
serious
and
well
structured.
In
the
middle
of
the
way
of
our
work
I
was
able
to
name
the
key
idea
of
almost
every
one-hundred-word
paragraph
in
the
book.
The
strict
structure
was
essential
to
predict
the
volume
of
the
book,
which
was
160
pages,
and
to
share
the
work
between
us,
two
authors.
I
had
always
thought
that
writing
a
book
would
be
a
hard
toil,
but
this
opinion
changed.
My
friend
and
I
had
so
much
fun
writing
it
that
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
experiences
in
our
lives.
In
the
very
start
we
shared
who
will
write
which
topics,
so
one
half
of
the
book
was
supposed
to
be
written
by
me
and
the
other
half
by
Rytis.
But
we
actually
proofread,
corrected,
edited
and
supplemented
each
otherOs
work
a
lot,
so
in
the
end
it
was
impossible
to
separate
which
sections
of
the
book
were
his
and
which
were
mine.
Such
a
way
of
work
improved
the
quality
of
the
manuscript
so
much
that
the
publisherOs
editor
said
that
she
did
not
have
to
change
anything.
My
friend
and
I
were
both
quite
good
writers
for
our
age,
but
very
different.
Nevertheless,
with
this
way
of
working
we
learnt
a
great
deal
from
each
other.
Editing
my
friends
work
gave
the
skills
that
I
think
will
be
very
useful
being
a
WA.
Our
book
had
a
more
journalistic
style
than
I
was
used
to,
but
after
it
I
have
also
published
some
more
sentimental
material
that
was
closer
to
the
style
I
liked.
That
summer
after
I
graduated
from
school
and
entered
the
manuscript
of
the
N$150,000
Worth
BookO
my
family
and
I
traveled
through
Spain
and
Portugal
with
our
car
for
about
a
month.
It
was
a
terrific
experience,
so
I
wrote
about
it
and
published
a
huge
5000-word
article
in
one
Lithuanian
travel
magazine.
This
time,
when
writing,
I
did
not
care
if
my
article
is
going
to
be
published
or
not,
so
I
did
not
spare
a
thought
about
what
the
magazine
or
the
audience
wanted.
I
did
it
for
myself
the
way
I
felt
liked
doing
it.
And
probably
for
this
reason
it
had
a
quality
that
made
my
mother
cry
reading
it.
The
article
mentioned
my
thanks
for
my
parents
for
the
trip,
but
now
when
I
think
about
it,
it
was
a
lot
more
than
that.
That
article
was
a
thank
you
and
good-bye
to
my
family
and
my
childhood,
because
after
a
couple
of
weeks
I
went
to
the
US.
In
the
US
I
started
speaking
English
all
the
time
and
it
had
a
lot
greater
impact
on
me
than
I
ever
imagined.
The
year
before
I
was
getting
quite
a
momentum
writing
for
publishing,
but
after
I
moved
to
US,
writing
in
Lithuanian
lost
its
sense.
So
I
went
back
to
the
genre
I
was
used
to,
letters.
Letters
were
changed
by
instant
messenger
and
email,
and
the
deeper
thought
and
feeling
were
slowly
lost
in
my
writing.
To
write
in
Lithuanian
for
publishing,
while
living
in
the
US,
would
cause
me
isolation
and
it
would
involve
other
sacrifices
I
cannot
make.
Besides,
from
my
publishing
experience
in
Lithuania
I
learnt
that
there
is
no
way
one
can
make
a
living
out
of
writing
in
Lithuanian.
Writing
in
English
is
the
only
option
I
have
left,
but
my
ability
to
write
in
English
is
so
much
worse
than
in
Lithuanian
that
I
am
still
very
pessimistic
about
it.
Sometimes
I
tell
myself
that
there
were
other
authors
who
successfully
wrote
in
their
third
language,
like
Joseph
Conrad.
But
then
again,
that
guy
went
crazy,
so
what
kind
of
success
is
that?
Now
I
am
putting
all
my
efforts
to
make
my
English
good
enough
to
express
the
things
I
want
to
express
in
a
proper
and
understandable
way.
I
am
taking
English
as
my
second
major,
I
do
Excel
in
English
and
this
WA
program.
I
hope
that
it
will
help
me
master
English
as
I
have
mastered
Lithuanian.
I
often
doubt
if
it
is
possible,
but
I
still
keep
on
working.
