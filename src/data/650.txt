My
history
as
a
writer
I
did
not
actually
learn
to
read
or
write
until
I
started
elementary
school,
at
age
7.
Though
I
donOt
remember
much
about
my
first
assignment
at
school,
I
do
remember
the
first
writing
assignment
my
mother
gave
me.
I
was
reading
my
first
book
D
a
collection
of
stories
by
Tolstoy
D
and
after
finishing
a
story
I
had
to
write
a
summary
about
it.
I
thought
it
was
great!
I
didnOt
have
to
just
copy
text
and
make
up
sentences
in
order
to
practice
beautiful
handwriting,
for
once.
It
turned
out,
I
was
also
pretty
good
at
summarizing.
However,
while
my
first
assignment
was
pretty
successful,
most
of
the
ones
that
came
after
did
not
leave
me
as
confident
of
myself.
Most
of
my
elementary
school
assignments
were
forms
of
creative
writing.
I
either
had
to
imagine
dialogues
between
people,
how
stories
would
end,
or
just
simply
imagine
situations
and
write
stories
about
them.
I
always
thought
I
was
not
a
very
creative
person.
I
couldnOt
really
write
funny
stories
and
I
didnOt
want
to
write
sad
stories
either.
Another
thing
was
that
the
writing
trend
in
elementary
school
was
using
plenty
of
embellishments,
trying
to
imitate
the
figures
of
speech
weOd
encounter
in
poems
and
other
texts
we
were
studying.
Mine
were
never
quite
unique
D
if
something
was
blue,
it
was
probably
Nas
blue
as
the
skyO,
unless,
of
course
it
was
more
marine
blue,
in
which
case
it
was
Nas
blue
as
the
sea.O
Describing
things
and
people
was
just
as
hard
for
me.
I
especially
recall
this
assignment
called
NThe
geranium
on
my
windowpaneO,
for
which
we
had
to
describe
a
houseplant
and
what
it
meant
to
us.
My
problem
was
that
I
never
had
much
interest
in
house
plants
D
they
were
just
pretty
if
they
had
flowers,
otherwise,
they
were
just
green
plants.
However,
I
couldnOt
just
say
that
in
my
composition.
First
of
all,
it
wouldnOt
have
been
long
enough!
Second
of
all,
I
would
have
probably
passed
as
a
selfish
disinterested
girl.
Finally,
compared
to
the
artistic
work
of
my
fellow
classmates
(or
their
parentsO)
my
composition
would
have
only
earned
a
NCO.
So
in
these
circumstances
I
tried
to
be
artisticE
to
come
up
with
interesting
and
intelligent
comparisons
and
metaphors.
With
the
help
of
my
mom,
I
passed
through
the
rough
times
and
got
good
grades.
However,
there
were
always
the
times
when
we
had
to
read
our
compositions
in
class.
Although
mine
were
good
enough,
they
always
lacked
the
sparkle
of
some
of
my
classmates.
In
hindsight,
they
obviously
did
because
most
of
the
times
I
could
not
be
genuine
in
my
writing.
Fake
writing
means
bad
writing.
Luckily,
the
situation
improved
in
middle
school,
when
we
started
writing
essays.
For
the
largest
part,
these
were
literary
analysis
essays
for
the
works
that
we
studied
in
class.
The
fact
that
they
had
a
structure
that
I
could
follow
was
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
me.
I
learned
the
basic
techniques
of
literary
analysis,
made
myself
a
template
and
it
worked
great.
Analyzing
I
could
do:
most
of
the
times
I
understood
what
the
texts
meant
and
could
pick
up
the
authorsO
ideas.
With
help
from
my
teachers,
I
could
interpret
the
symbols
and
metaphors
as
well,
so
I
was
all
set.
My
essays
were
no
work
of
art,
but
they
made
sense,
contained
good
analyses
and
were
good
essays
overall.
The
literary
analysis
essays
continued
throughout
my
high-school
time,
as
well,
but
luckily
I
also
learned
other
things,
especially
in
English
classes.
Mostly,
I
learned
how
to
write
structured
pieces,
like
for-and-against
or
opinion
type
essays.
Again,
the
essays
having
a
structure
made
things
pretty
easy
for
me.
I
always
followed
the
same
plan:
pick
up
about
three
arguments,
and
then
develop
on
them.
What
I
really
liked
about
high
school
writing
though
were
a
couple
of
NspecialO
pieces
that
I
had
a
chance
to
do
in
my
Romanian
classes.
Since
those
classes
were
mostly
centered
around
literary
texts,
all
the
assignments
were
also
based
on
these
texts.
Every
once
in
a
while,
though,
we
had
themes
that
allowed
us
more
freedom
in
thought
and
writing
and
I
loved
that.
One
of
my
favorite
assignments
was
defending
this
character
who,
in
the
story,
had
murdered
his
wife
out
of
jealousy.
I
loved
everything
about
the
assignment:
the
thinking
process,
as
well
as
the
writing
one.
I
tried
to
get
into
the
characterOs
head
and
see
what
he
was
thinking
and
feeling.
After
I
felt
like
I
understood
him,
I
could
get
out
and
starts
writing.
I
created
my
essay
as
if
pleading
in
front
of
the
jury,
starting
off
with
a
few
defensive
arguments,
combating
those
against
them,
and
then
ended
again
on
the
defense.
I
thought
it
was
beautiful
and
so
did
my
teacher
and
classmates.
It
was
one
of
my
biggest
writing
successes
in
high
school.
Coming
to
college,
I
didnOt
think
writing
per
se
would
be
too
much
of
a
challenge,
but
I
was
wrong.
The
first
issue
I
faced
was
actually
the
fact
that
all
my
life,
I
had
been
writing
on
paper.
I
learned
to
write
using
a
fountain
pen
and
used
that
for
most
of
my
writings.
In
high
school
I
started
using
other
writing
tools
too,
like
pencils
and
regular
pens,
but
regardless
of
it,
I
was
always
writing
on
paper,
in
a
notebook.
Starting
college
and
finding
myself
having
to
submit
assignments
typed,
I
found
myself
starring
at
the
screen,
with
my
hands
on
the
keyboard,
and
lost
for
ideas.
I
had
always
known
that
the
writing
tools
were
important
for
writing,
which
is
why
I
always
had
a
very
wide
selection
of
pens
to
fit
my
mood
and
my
assignment.
However,
I
hadnOt
really
thought
that
typing
would
be
so
hard
for
me.
Since
I
had
to
do
it,
though,
I
did
it.
It
took
me
a
while
to
get
used
to
typing
D
probably
the
whole
of
the
first
semester
of
college.
I
used
to
do
my
outlines
on
paper,
and
then
start
typing
on
the
computer.
It
also
happened
often
that
I
would
start
a
paragraph
and
then
erase
everything
because
it
didnOt
sound
like
me.
It
took
me
time
to
find
my
voice
on
the
keyboard,
but
with
practice,
it
came.
My
college
writing
experience
started
with
my
First
Year
Seminar,
one
of
the
courses
that
prepared
me
best
for
writing
in
college.
Our
first
written
assignment
for
the
class
was
a
two-page
piece
entitled
NThis
I
BelieveO.
I
thought
about
the
topic
and
wrote.
I
felt
like
I
put
some
good
ideas
in
the
essay,
yet
it
came
back
with
a
C-
on
it.
Needless
to
say,
I
was
very
disappointed
D
it
was
probably
the
worst
grade
I
had
ever
gotten.
So
I
talked
to
my
professor
and
she
talked
to
me
about
all
sorts
of
things
I
hadnOt
really
thought
of
before:
writing
for
the
reader
and
not
for
myself,
clarity,
topic
sentences.
She
said
indeed
the
ideas
were
good,
but
my
writing
didnOt
put
them
across
clearly.
I
tried
to
address
these
issues
in
other
small
pieces
of
writing
we
had
for
the
class
and
kind
of
got
a
sense
for
what
the
professor
was
talking
about.
Then
came
the
research
paper
and
the
problem
of
the
thesis.
To
start
with,
I
had
never
written
a
research
paper
before;
the
task
in
itself
was
daunting.
The
professorOs
emphasis
that
it
should
not
be
just
a
large
collection
of
facts,
but
arguments
and
evidence
in
support
of
my
thesis,
made
the
task
seem
even
more
complicated.
Luckily,
the
writing
associate
for
the
class
was
very
helpful
for
this
assignment.
He
helped
improve
my
first
draft
by
showing
me
how
to
extract
ideas
and
conclusions
out
of
facts
and
create
a
nicely
rounded
thesis.
When
I
handed
in
the
paper,
I
felt
a
lot
more
confident
about
the
idea
of
a
research
paper
than
when
I
had
started
it.
Yet,
I
still
only
got
a
B
for
my
paper.
Nevertheless,
I
was
determined
that
by
the
end
of
the
course,
IOd
get
there.
So
for
the
last
big
essay
of
the
class,
I
tried
to
do
everything
as
best
as
I
could.
I
got
my
ideas
set,
stated
my
thesis
loud
and
clear
in
the
beginning
and
continued
with
every
argument
stated
simply
and
clearly.
This
time
it
wasnOt
only
me
who
was
proud
of
my
essay,
but
also
my
professor,
who
gave
me
a
full
A.
My
FYS
was
one
of
the
classes
I
worked
most
that
first
semester.
However,
I
can
truly
say
it
was
worth
all
the
effort.
What
I
learned
while
making
my
way
from
C-
to
A
has
come
in
handy
for
all
my
subsequent
pieces
of
writing.
Another
example
of
a
writing
assignment
that
prepared
me
really
well
for
writing
in
my
college
courses
was
the
first
lab
report
I
had
to
write
for
a
psychology
lab.
As
I
mentioned
repeatedly,
I
love
following
a
template
in
my
writing.
So,
since
the
lab
report
had
a
set
structure
to
it,
I
already
liked
it.
While
it
wasnOt
as
easy
as
I
first
thought,
I
learned
important
lessons,
such
as
what
details
are
important
and
need
to
be
included
in
a
report
and
which
are
not
as
important.
I
also
learned
about
the
language
of
scientific
paper
writing
and
the
importance
of
being
careful
when
using
certain
terms.
I
have
been
writing
many
papers
since
my
first
year
of
college.
Most
of
time,
due
to
the
nature
of
my
major
(neuroscience)
they
are
either
research
papers
or
lab
reports.
While
my
first
semester
writing
experiences
were
key
to
developing
my
writing
abilities
and
advancing
them
to
the
college
level,
every
piece
of
writing
contributed
to
this
end.
Moreover,
with
every
paper
I
wrote,
I
became
more
confident
that
I
could
tackle
any
writing
assignment
successfully.
Besides
writing
for
class,
over
the
past
two
years
I
started
writing
in
a
form
I
had
dismissed
many
times
before:
blogging.
I
started
off
with
a
personal
blog,
writing
every
once
in
a
while
about
ideas
that
got
stuck
in
my
head
and
really
enjoyed
the
freedom.
I
liked
writing
for
myself,
trying
to
sort
out
my
ideas,
rather
than
trying
to
make
myself
understood
to
an
audience.
Applying
for
a
writing
associate
position
was
a
big
step
for
me.
Whereas
some
of
my
friends
applied
for
the
job
at
the
end
of
their
freshman
year,
I
didnOt
feel
comfortable
enough
to
do
it.
It
wasnOt
until
the
end
of
my
junior
year
that
I
had
that
NI
got
thisO
feeling
about
writing
and
could
actually
think
about
helping
others
in
their
struggles
too.
