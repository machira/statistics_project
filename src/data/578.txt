Literacy
Narrative
The
story
of
my
writing
career
is
a
long,
meandering,
circular,
love-hate
adventure
with
a
pen
D
or
pencil,
crayon,
typewriter,
colored
pencil
or
keyboard.
From
my
earliest
memories
of
writing,
I
have
gone
through
swings
of
hating
it,
being
good
at
it,
turning
in
some
incredibly
awful
pieces,
winning
awards
and,
dare
I
say,
truly
enjoying
and
appreciating
it.
The
following
account
of
my
history
as
a
perpetually
developing
writer
will
surely
not
be
complete,
but
it
will
hopefully
be
able
to
capture
the
dynamic
relationship
I
have
had
with
this
unique
craft.
Looking
back,
I
am
really
able
to
pinpoint
a
number
of
times
throughout
my
life
that
particularly
stand
out
to
me
as
special
moments,
and
I
am
looking
forward
to
reflecting
upon
these
experiences.
Spending
significant
amounts
of
time
during
the
first
and
second
grades
poring
over
sheets
and
sheets
of
grayish-tan
tablet
paper
filled
with
light
blue
dotted
lines
is
perhaps
both
my
earliest
and
fondest
memory
of
writing.
I
developed
a
liking
for
the
repetitive
nature
of
copying
each
letter
of
the
alphabet
hundreds
of
times
in
print
and
then,
later,
in
cursive
script.
I
think
part
of
why
I
liked
this
task
so
much
was
because
I
was
rather
good
at
it
and
received
praise
from
my
teachers.
Writing
all
of
these
characters
also
probably
played
a
part
in
shaping
me
into
the
perfectionist
I
am,
and
reflecting
upon
it
now,
this
is
an
early
example
of
how
writing
has
affected
who
I
am
as
a
person
beyond
just
my
writing
abilities.
Unfortunately,
my
perfect
handwriting
eventually
fell
victim
to
the
fast-paced,
shorthanded
nature
of
note-taking
later
in
my
educational
career,
but
copying
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
over
and
over
certainly
played
a
major
role
in
laying
the
groundwork
for
my
future
writing
abilities.
Sometime
later
in
elementary
school,
I
can
remember
taking
a
field
trip
to
the
local
Renaissance
Faire.
At
the
end
of
the
field
trip,
everyone
was
required
to
write
a
frighteningly
long,
detailed
reflection
paper
that
had
to
be
an
unimaginable
125
words
long.
Fortunately,
my
family
had
a
computer
with
a
word
processor
and
printer
at
this
point,
so,
I
was
not
one
of
the
unlucky
ones
who
had
to
write
this
piece
by
hand
on
those
same
grayish-tan
tablets
with
light
blue
lines
(only
by
this
time
the
lines
were
no
longer
dotted
and
they
were
much
smaller).
I
think
this
was
the
first
time
I
had
an
assignment
with
a
length
requirement,
and,
thus,
this
was
also
the
first
time
I
discovered
what
the
NWord
CountO
function
in
Microsoft
Word
was.
Oddly
enough,
this
was
also
the
beginning
of
the
first
of
my
swings
into
a
phase
during
which
I
despised
the
thought
of
writing.
I
think
part
of
my
disdain
was
also
because
the
timing
of
this
long,
arduous
writing
assignment
coincided
with
the
time
I
became
interested
in
math
and
science.
Science
and
math
have
always
played
a
major
role
in
my
life,
culminating
with
the
fact
that
I
chose
to
major
in
Biochemistry
at
Lafayette.
At
the
elementary
school
level,
the
type
of
science
and
math
work
is
very
number
oriented
and
requires
a
minimal
amount
of
writing,
if
any
writing
at
all.
As
a
result,
not
only
was
my
interest
in
math
and
science
fostered,
but
I
think
I
began
to
develop
the
mentality
that
writing
was
not
necessary.
My
feelings
toward
writing
continued
throughout
elementary
and
early
middle
school,
and
it
was
not
until
the
eighth
grade
when
I
had
my
first
true
English
course
that
my
opinions
began
to
change.
I
had
been
reading
books,
writing
short
papers,
and
doing
grammatical
work
until
this
point,
but
in
eighth
grade
my
teacher
finally
made
me
realize
that
all
of
these
disciplines
were
connected.
I
can
remember
not
just
reading
novels,
poetry
and
short
stories,
but
also
beginning
to
write
sort
of
prototypical
analysis
papers
about
the
readings
we
did,
and
perfecting
grammar
skills
all
at
the
same
time.
It
was
also
during
the
end
of
my
middle
school
years
that
I
first
had
the
opportunity
to
write
poetry.
When
it
was
first
introduced
to
me,
poetry
was
something
I
had
only
ever
known
to
be
a
very
rigid,
always
rhyming,
almost
song-like
art.
I
learned
quickly
that
poetry
was
a
very
unique
way
to
get
my
thoughts
out
on
paper,
and
I
guess
this
was
probably
part
of
a
turn
around
where
I
began
to
look
more
favorably
upon
writing
(although
I
still
did
not
like
the
idea
of
writing
full
papers).
Initially,
my
poetry
consisted
of
rather
simple
sonnets,
but
I
eventually
moved
on
to
more
abstract,
artistic
forms
of
poetry,
which,
much
to
my
initial
dismay,
did
not
rhyme
but
were
definitely
more
unique
and
more
capable
of
getting
thoughts
out.
Another
factor
in
the
beginning
of
this
turn
around
was
the
award
I
won
for
an
opinion
piece
I
wrote.
I
vaguely
remember
that
this
story
had
something
to
do
with
my
feelings
about
alarm
clocks
and
why
I
hate
being
rudely
awakened
by
them
in
the
mornings,
but
the
topic
of
this
paper
is
not
the
important
part.
Rather,
this
award
gave
me
some
much
needed
confidence
about
my
writing
skills.
Until
this
point,
I
had
convinced
myself
that
I
my
writing
skills
were
not
much
more
than
mediocre,
and
this
award
made
me
at
least
begin
to
rethink
how
I
felt
about
myself
as
a
writer.
While
my
opinion
of
writing
was
on
the
upswing,
the
possibility
of
a
complete
turnaround
was
quickly
smothered
by
my
ninth
grade
honors
English
course,
which
brought
with
it
the
infamous
10-page
research
paper.
I
think
what
made
the
10-pager
so
terrifying
and
despised
was
not
simply
that
it
required
a
double
digit
number
of
pages
but
also
the
fact
that
this
was
a
procedure
that
was
dragged
out
over
the
course
of
an
entire
semester.
Between
preliminary
outlines,
note
cards,
second
draft
outlines,
thesis
statements,
first
drafts,
second
drafts,
etc.
it
made
the
entire
process
seem
more
of
an
endeavor
than
it
really
is.
Anymore,
I
can
breeze
through
a
10-page
research
paper
in
a
few
days,
but
looking
back,
part
of
what
allows
me
to
write
10-pages
with
such
relative
ease
as
a
senior
in
college
was
the
seemingly
tedious
task
of
writing
10-pages
as
a
freshman
in
high
school.
While
I
am
no
longer
required
to
submit
outline
drafts,
thesis
statements
and
a
stack
of
50
note
cards
with
bits
of
information,
these
processes
are
things
that
I
do
almost
subconsciously
now,
albeit
in
a
somewhat
modified
way.
I
may
not
write
out
all
of
my
facts
on
note
cards,
but
I
will
highlight
and
take
notes
on
my
sources.
In
the
same
light,
I
may
not
submit
three
separate
versions
of
an
outline
with
each
separate
paragraph
planned
out,
but
I
always
scribble
out
something
that
resembles
an
outline
just
to
ensure
that
I
have
some
idea
of
where
I
am
taking
a
paper.
The
important
point
is
that
I
am
now
able
to
write
better
and
more
efficiently
as
a
result
of
being
required
to
jump
through
all
of
the
hoops
starting
as
a
freshman
in
high
school.
For
the
next
two
years,
I
was
ambivalent
about
my
writing,
not
ever
having
much
of
a
liking
for
it
but,
at
the
same
time,
beginning
to
see
the
ever-expanding
influence
it
was
having
on
my
studies.
Still
focusing
on
the
sciences,
and
advancing
from
basic
biology
and
earth
science
to
more
challenging
disciplines
such
as
chemistry
and
physics,
I
began
to
discover
just
how
much
I
could
benefit
as
a
scientist
to
be
a
good
writer.
It
was
no
longer
sufficient
to
crunch
a
couple
of
numbers,
spit
out
an
answer
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
circle
it
emphatically
(although
I
would
be
lying
if
I
said
that
doesnOt
still
give
me
great
pleasure
to
this
day).
I
was
beginning
to
learn
that
any
accomplishment
in
science
was
nothing
without
a
meticulously
kept
lab
notebook,
followed
by
a
well
written,
concise,
yet
extremely
informative
lab
report.
In
fact,
it
was
the
Science
Fair,
arguably
the
10-page
paper
of
the
science
track,
which
first
made
me
realize
this.
The
Science
Fair
was
a
requirement
for
all
freshman,
sophomore
and
junior
honors
science
classes,
and
I
was
more
than
content
doing
the
experimental
part
of
the
project.
However,
and
looking
back
it
is
clear
why
this
was
the
case,
the
majority
of
the
grade
on
the
Science
Fair
was
not
for
the
experimental
aspect,
nor
for
the
poster
board
presentation,
but
for
the
lab
report
and
experimental
write-up
requirements.
As
much
as
the
Science
Fair
ruined
my
winter
breaks
for
the
first
three
years
of
high
school
with
all
of
the
time
I
spent
experimenting
and
writing,
it
is
the
earliest
memories
I
have
of
scientific
writing.
As
I
continued
through
my
educational
career
with
a
focus
in
science,
it
became
evident
what
an
invaluable
skill
writing
is
for
the
sciences.
While
it
was
never
hard
for
me
to
push
myself
in
the
sciences
and
take
difficult
courses
such
as
AP
Chemistry,
I
decided
to
only
take
honors
English
instead
of
AP
during
my
junior
year.
I
actually
signed
up
for
honors
again
for
senior
year,
but
something
got
into
me
during
the
summer
before
senior
year,
and
I
remember
calling
my
high
school
three
days
before
the
deadline
for
making
schedule
changes
and
dropping
honors
and
registering
for
AP
Literature.
AP
Literature
was
definitely
the
farthest
I
flexed
my
academic
muscles
in
high
school.
Science
people
did
not
take
AP
English
classes,
and
people
who
took
AP
English
classes
would
sooner
die
than
take
any
science
course,
much
less
something
notoriously
difficult
such
as
AP
Chemistry,
but
there
were
a
few
of
us
who
decided
to
take
a
risk,
and
it
turned
out
to
be
perhaps
one
of
the
most
fulfilling
experiences
of
high
school.
The
best
part
about
this
class
was
being
introduced
to
the
style
of
analytical
writing.
I
had
long
been
familiar
with
the
standard
informative,
persuasive,
narrative,
etc.
genres
of
essays,
but
this
type
of
writing
was
like
a
scientific
study
only
it
was
in
the
English
classroom,
not
a
laboratory,
and
it
allowed
me
to
use
skills
I
had
developed
from
my
background
in
science.
My
attention
to
detail,
an
ability
to
pick
out
minute,
yet
important
points,
and
the
chance
to
interpret
my
findings
in
a
logical,
well-supported
manner
made
analytical
reading
and
writing
like
a
science
experiment
of
literature.
Another
characteristic
of
analytical
writing
that
appealed
to
me
was
the
open-ended
nature
of
it.
Science
requires
you
to
find
the
correct
answer
and
interpret
your
findings
in
a
very
rigid,
pre-set,
correct
way,
but
the
refreshing
part
about
analytical
writing
was
that
there
is
never
a
right
or
wrong
answer.
I
will
always
remember
my
teacher
telling
the
class
that,
Nthe
greatest
thing
about
analysis
pieces
is
that
you
can
say
the
most
off-the-wall,
completely
crazy
things,
just
so
long
as
you
back
it
up
with
facts
and
a
well-constructed
argument.O
This
really
sank
in
because
I
was
beginning
to
feel
somewhat
constrained
in
my
science
classes
because
everything
in
the
sciences
is
black
or
white,
and
never
the
gray
areas
in
the
middle.
It
was
also
during
AP
English
that
I
wrote
a
poem
which
ultimately
won
me
a
Scholastic
Writing
Gold
Key
Award.
I
had
written
this
poem
about
something
very
personal,
but
it
was
written
in
such
a
way
that
any
reader
would
never
know
what
I
was
writing
about,
so,
on
a
whim,
I
decided
to
submit
it
to
the
Scholastic
Writing
Contest
(alright,
so
it
wasnOt
exactly
a
whim,
but
rather
the
fact
that
my
teacher
promised
she
would
cut
the
requirements
on
our
monthly
writing
portfolios
down
from
five
pieces
to
four
pieces
if
we
submitted
something
to
the
contest).
The
point
is
that
I
came
away
from
AP
Literature
with
not
only
a
new
found
interest
in
being
able
to
write
about
anything
I
damn
well
pleased
without
having
someone
tell
me
I
was
wrong
but
also
with
a
confidence
about
my
writing
which
I
never
had
before.
I
ended
up
scoring
well
enough
on
the
AP
test
to
place
out
of
college
writing
at
Lafayette,
but
the
seed
was
planted
during
AP
Lit
that
would
grow
into
the
appreciation
I
have
for
writing
now
as
I
enter
my
senior
year
of
college.
College
has
done
nothing
but
continue
to
foster
this
appreciation
I
have
for
writing.
I
actually
enjoy
writing
research
papers
now
because
I
feel
like
I
learn
so
much
from
them
every
time
I
finish
one,
and
my
concise
and
complete
lab
reports
are
oftentimes
the
reason
my
final
grades
in
science
courses
are
a
letter
grade
higher
than
they
should
be.
Lately,
I
have
even
found
myself
bringing
writing
into
disciplines
beyond
just
the
classroom.
On
a
recent
trip
to
London
I
kept
a
personal
journal
of
the
daily
events
and
my
feelings
about
each
day,
and
a
few
months
back
I
found
myself
pouring
my
heart
out
in
a
letter
to
a
certain
long-distance
love
interest
of
mine
instead
of
calling
her
because
I
felt
I
would
be
more
able
to
convey
my
thoughts
on
paper
than
by
talking
on
the
phone
(in
case
youOre
wondering,
she
liked
the
letter).
Writing
and
I
have
gone
through
a
long,
tumultuous
relationship
since
I
first
traced
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
as
a
first-grader,
but
I
am
happy
to
say
that
I
have
finally
reached
the
point
where
I
enjoy
writing
and
the
non-constrictive
outlet
it
affords
me
after
years
and
years
of
compliance
to
the
rigid
requirements
of
science
courses
as
a
Biochemistry
major.
I
feel
like
I
will
be
bringing
a
unique
perspective
to
the
WA
program,
and
I
think
it
is
the
roundabout
approach
I
have
taken
in
achieving
peace
with
writing
that
made
it
so
easy
for
me
to
reflect
upon
my
history
as
a
writer.
I
am
looking
forward
to
being
a
WA
and
having
the
opportunity
to
apply
my
unique
outlook
on
writing
in
a
way
that
hopefully
has
a
positive
impact
on
someone
elseOs
writing.
