WA

I
started
my
literary
career
at
a
very
young
age.
I
have
vague
memories
of
learning
to
read,
as
my
mom
and
I
pored
over
little
kiddie
books.
My
mom
was
a
journalist,
who
was
working
at
a
newspaper
in
Nigeria
at
the
time.
We
would
work
on
pronunciation
of
the
various
words,
and
I
remember
loving
the
written
word.
My
fondest
writing
memory
occurred
when
I
was
around
5
years
old.
After
watching
one
of
my
favorite
television
shows-
Sesame
Street-
I
decided
to
imitate
the
antics
of
a
certain
character,
named
Cowboy
X
.
He
walked
around
leaving
his
signature
-an
X-
on
objects.
Naturally,
this
appealed
to
me,
so
I
decorated
the
furniture
in
my
house
with
X's,
as
I
chanted
Cowboy
X,
Cowboy
X
.
(I
also
remember
scrubbng
off
all
those
X's,
and
thinking
about
how
good
ol'
Cowboy
X
never
had
to
go
through
all
that!)
I
moved
on
to
inventing
actual
short
stories
and
writing
them
down.
I
remember
people
praising
my
imagination
and
writing
ability.
But
somehow
I
subconsciously
felt
that
I
was
at
the
age
when
people
seemed
to
be
excited
about
everything
that
the
little
girl
did,
so
I
took
their
compliments
with
a
grain
of
salt.
I
also
discovered
illustration
at
this
time,
and
developed
a
habit
of
drawing
pictures
to
go
with
my
stories.
During
my
years
at
Air
Force
Primary
School
in
Nigeria,
(1st
through
5th
grade)
I
remember
being
nervous
when
I
received
writing
assignments,
as
I
worried
that
my
writing
might
not
be
good
enough.
However,
once
more,
I
received
many
compliments
and
good
grades.
I
remember
turning
to
my
mother
and
asking
her
advice,
or
asking
her
to
help
me
edit
and
sophisticate
my
work.
Grammar,
vocabulary
and
correct
word
usage
became
a
part
of
my
literary
training
.
My
parents
encouraged
this,
by
making
my
elder
brother
and
I
look
up
words
in
the
dictionary.
We
were
avid
readers
(my
brother
and
I),
and
whenever
we
came
across
a
difficult
word
in
a
newspaper,
book,
or
when
we
all
played
Scrabble,
we
would
ask
our
parents
what
the
word
meant.
Their
automatic
response?
Look
it
up
.
I
hated
that
phrase
and
thought
it
was
the
most
frustrating
thing
that
they
ever
said
to
us!
I
came
to
America
in
the
summer
of
1985.
I
was
enrolled
at
St.
Peter
Grammar
School.
I
remember
a
cetain
Religion
class
writing
assignment
and
feeling
a
little
anxious.
Afterall,
I
was
in
a
brand
new
school
(and
continent!),
and
not
really
sure
how
my
writing
and
style
would
compare
to
my
peers.
I
didn't
have
much
experience
writing
term
papers,
but
judging
by
my
classmates
reaction
to
the
assignment,
writing
term
papers
was
a
difficult
task.
When
I
received
an
A,
and
a
whole
bunch
of
praise,
my
confidence
in
my
ability
increased.
Then
there
was
the
big
research
paper
on
heritage.
I
remember
working
hard
on
that
paper,
and
using
Nigerian
postcards,
currency
and
pictures
to
ilustrate
the
paper.
I
drew
maps,
made
a
construcion
paper
cover,
and
of
course
got
my
mom
to
look
over
the
hand-written
paper.
I
also
recall
waiting
until
the
last
minute
to
get
started
on
my
paper
(
a
habit
that
I
have
yet
to
lose!).
My
friends
would
constantly
ask
me
have
you
started
yet?!
I
think
some
of
the
reason
for
my
prorastination
stemmed
from
nervousness,
distraction
(it
seemed
as
though
I
was
always
busy!)
and
maybe
just
a
natural
undefinable
tendency
to
work
best
under
pressure.
The
paper
was
very
long,
received
a
lot
of
compliments
(as
well
as
the
highest
grade
in
the
class),
and
it
also
served
to
highlight
the
fact
that
I
printed
as
opposed
to
writing
in
script.
Everyone
seemed
to
be
impressed
by
the
fact
that
I
had
printed
the
whole
paper.
I
remember
thinking...of
course,
that's
how
I
write!
This
revelation
led
to
the
teacher
getting
a
third
grade
writing
book,
and
a
bunch
of
my
friends
volunteering
to
teach
me
how
to
script.
I
found
it
all
quite
frustrating.
In
Nigeria,
we
were
graded
for
handwriting,
but
this
meant
neatness
basically.
My
printing
was
neat
enough
to
earn
me
high
grades
in
that
category,
and
I
never
had
anyone
hounding
me
to
write
a
certain
way.
However,
I
cooperated
and
practiced
scripting
along
with
my
other
subjects.
But
to
this
day,
I
prefer
to
resort
to
my
more
familiar
writing
style.
My
next
most
memorable
assignment
was
a
report
I
did
on
irrigation
in
the
seventh
grade.
This
was
another
almost
last
minute
job.
I
remember
my
mom
taking
me
to
the
library,
and
sitting
up
with
me
as
we
worked
on
my
big
project
.
My
father
had
purchased
a
big
clunky,
old
fashioned
typewriter,
and
my
mom
and
I
painstakingly
typed
the
paper.
In
the
end,
I
had
a
paper,
a
couple
of
big
posters
with
lovely
National
Geographic
pictures,
and
basically
an
abundance
of
information
about
irrigation.
I
had
to
do
an
oral
presentation
about
my
paper
the
next
day
in
school.
As
I
stood
up
in
front
of
the
class,
talking
and
using
my
posters
to
illustrate,
I
remember
thinking
about
how
I
might
actually
have
too
much
material.
Afterall,
the
other
presentations
weren't
this
long....I
suddenly
realized
that
I
was
pointing
at
a
desert
and
talking
about
a
forest!
I
stared
at
my
poster
in
disbelief,
stumbled,
and
tried
to
figure
out
whether
it
was
my
poster
or
my
notecards
that
were
playing
tricks
on
me.
Somehow
I
got
through
the
presentation,
without
too
many
people
noticing..
I
think
that
they
were
still
stumbed
over
the
fact
that
I
had
so
much
to
say!
As
I
sat
in
my
seat,
listening
to
the
next
student,
I
recalled
that
when
I
had
gone
to
bed
the
night
before,
my
mom
had
talked
me
into
letting
her
type
out
my
notecards,
so
that
reading
them
would
be
easier.
After
a
long
day
and
night
of
work,
only
to
return
home
to
help
me,
she
had
apparently
switched
the
labels
on
two
of
them.
11
year
old
Bessie
was
furious,
and
made
no
attempt
to
hide
that
fact
(later
I
realized
how
much
my
mom
had
put
into
helping
me,
and
I
apologized
for
my
attitude).
I
also
found
myself
writing
book
reports,
and
getting
accustomed
to
that
format.
My
mom
enrolled
me
in
the
summer
reading
club
at
the
local
library
that
summer.
I
had
to
read
books
and
write
book
report
summaries
on
them.
My
handwritten
book
reports
tended
to
be
quite
detailed.
There
were
times
when
I
was
very
pleased
with
some
of
these
reports,
for
instance,
if
I
especially
liked
a
certain
phrase
that
I
used.
I
remember
sitting
in
the
library,
reading
and
writing
away,
and
almost
wishing
that
the
reports
were
graded,
so
that
I
would
have
some
form
of
feedback
or
evaluation
of
my
efforts.
I
continued
to
participate
in
the
summer
reading
club,
until
I
was
no
longer
eligible
(ie
I
graduated
from
eight
grade).
I
watched
the
program
change
and
become
more
lenient,
as
it
became
acceptable
for
one
to
merely
give
an
oral
summary
of
the
book.
Later,
as
my
younger
brother
and
sister
became
members,
I
stared
in
disbelief
as
their
only
requirement
was
to
write
down
the
name
of
the
book
and
author!
My
seventh
grade
English
teacher
Mrs.
Pitone
became
a
fan
of
my
writing.
I
did
well
in
her
English
and
spelling
classes,
yet
my
modest
nature
found
it
hard
to
understand
why
she
was
constantly
praising
my
work.
My
vocabulary
and
writing
style
began
to
develop.
However,
my
procrastination
did
not
improve
greatly.
I
remember
sneaking
a
paper
into
a
stack
of
submitted
papers,
a
day
later,
and
pretending
that
it
had
been
there
all
along!
She
was
also
my
eight
grade
English
teacher
as
well,
and
remained
very
supportive
of
my
work.
At
times
I
recall
being
almost
embarassed
by
her
praise,
because
I
didn't
see
how
my
writing
was
so
great.
Writing
became
an
aspect
of
my
entertainment
as
well.
I
played
a
very
large
role
in
the
raising
of
my
younger
brother
and
sister.
I
would
invent
stories
to
tell
them,
sometimes
jotting
down
my
ideas,
or
using
my
writing
to
teach
them
to
read.
Sometimes
in
our
attempts
to
memorize
the
words
to
certain
songs,
my
best
friend
or
my
elder
brother
and
I
would
write
down
the
lyrics
and
sing
along.
I
remember
my
best
friend
bringing
the
Lean
on
Me
record
to
class
one
day,
and
during
art
period,
we
played
the
song
repeatedly
and
sang
along.
My
first
experience
writing
a
song
came
when
my
music
teacher
Mr
VanHise
decided
to
have
his
students
make
a
video.
We
came
up
with
a
rap/rock
music
'battle"
(which
ended
of
course
with
no
winner,
but
rather
an
appreciation
of
the
many
forms
of
musical
expression).
We
had
to
write
lyrics
for
both
sides,
create
the
music
to
accompany
the
words,
as
well
as
perform
the
various
tasks
that
go
into
making
a
video.
I
was
also
chosen
to
perform
on
the
rap
side,
and
remember
feeling
apprehensive,
because
I
still
had
a
nigerian
accent,
and
no
experience
as
a
rapper.
However,
the
project
was
a
success,
and
was
enlightening
for
me
in
terms
of
writing.
Although
I
was
a
chorus
member,
I
had
always
considered
song-writing
as
reserved
for
individuals
who
were
musical
geniuses.
One
of
the
requirements
of
Mrs.
Pitone's
class
was
that
we
keep
a
journal.
I
enjoyed
doing
this,
and
found
that
I
was
able
to
organize
my
thoughts
and
feelings
on
paper.
Writing
about
my
opinions
and
experiences
became
a
means
of
getting
to
know
myself.
Around
this
same
time,
I
also
discovered
the
therapeutic
benefits
of
clunking
away
on
my
father's
old
typewriter.
Whether
I
was
feeling
creative,
or
if
I
had
just
had
an
arguement
with
someone,
I
found
the
combination
of
banging
away
on
the
old
keys
and
seeing
my
words
on
paper
to
be
quite
refreshing
and
soothing.
When
I
got
to
Rutgers
Prep
School
(9th
grade),
I
experienced
the
usual
anxieties
that
surface
when
one
makes
the
transition
from
middle
school
to
highschool--would
the
work
be
too
hard?
Would
I
fit
in
with
the
older,
sophisticated
highschoolers?
Would
my
writing
and
my
ideas
be
viewed
as
babyish
and
naive?
I
was
ale
to
overcome
the
new
challenges
that
I
faced
rather
quickly.
For
instance,
at
St
Peter,
although
I
had
written
a
science
research
paper,
I
didn't
really
have
any
experience
writing
lab
reports.
There
were
some
similarities
in
terms
of
writing
assignments
at
St
Peter
and
Rutgers
Prep,
such
as
keeping
a
journal.
I
found
this
exercise
to
be
helpful,
because
it
forced
me
to
express
my
opinions
or
responses
to
works
and
also
once
more,
served
as
a
means
of
self
analysis.
The
summer
after
9th
grade,
my
mom
enrolled
me
at
the
Summer
Arts
Institute.
As
the
youngest
member
(14
years
old)
of
my
department,
I
was
afraid
that
my
writing
might
be
too
simple
,
as
I
sat
awed
by
the
sophistication
and
depth
of
my
peers'
work.
Imagine
my
surprise
when
my
instructors
and
fellow
artists
began
to
praise
my
writing!
Initially
I
thought
that
they
were
just
being
nice,
afterall
how
could
my
writing
possibly
measure
up
to
that
of
such
obviously
experienced
writers?
I
had
never
considered
myself
much
of
a
poet,
and
felt
that
if
I
stuck
to
fiction,
I
would
be
o.k.
One
day,
we
did
an
exercise
whereby
we
were
supposed
to
compose
a
poem
in
reponse
to
a
visual
stimuli.
As
we
shared
our
work
later,
someone
said
that
they
would
be
interested
to
hear
what
I
written.
The
group
response
was
very
positive,
and
it
encouraged
me
to
explore
my
boundaries
as
a
poet.
Back
at
Rutgers
Prep,
my
English
professors
noticed
my
development,
and
persuaded
me
to
submit
my
material
to
literary
publications
and
contests.
I
had
two
English
teachers
who
were
very
infleuntial
in
that
regard.
Mr.
Kendall,
who
was
also
my
homeroom
teacher
was
always
giving
me
information
about
contests,
and
trying
to
get
me
to
submit
to
the
school's
literary
magazine,
the
Excelsior.
He
was
also
successful
in
getting
me
to
join
the
editing
staff
of
the
publication.
Mrs.
Herzberg
seemed
to
also
enjoy
my
writing
and
ideas.
As
a
drama
teacher
and
advisor,
she
introduced
me
to
the
analysis
of
classical
drama,
and
dramatic
reading.
I
took
an
advanced
placement
english
course
with
her,
and
excelled.
I
remember
writing
a
piece
in
response
to
a
play,
The
Dead
by
Robert
Camus.
This
was
probably
the
first
time
that
I
used
urban
vernacular
in
my
writing.
Mrs.
Herzberg
loved
it,
and
suggested
that
I
submit
it
to
somebody!
Of
course
I
showed
it
to
my
mom,
who
liked
it
as
well.
My
grandmother
heard
all
the
commotion
over
the
piece,
and
asked
if
she
could
read
it
too.
I
was
very
nervous
about
having
her
read
it,
because
I
was
not
sure
how
she
would
feel
about
my
language.
Would
it
offend
her?
Would
she
feel
that
as
an
educated
individual
I
should
not
highlight
what
society
labels
as
an
inferior
dialect?
I
paced
around
as
she
read,
worried
about
what
her
reaction
would
be.
When
she
finished,
she
said
something
to
the
effect
of
understanding
how
I
wrote
in
the
same
way
that
the
characters
spoke,
and
that
she
liked
it.
Relief!
In
highschool
I
was
exposed
to
classic
french
literature.
As
I
began
to
take
more
advanced
levels
of
french,
I
learned
to
read
french
literature
and
to
express
myself
on
paper
in
that
language.
My
french
professor
assigned
compositions,
and
for
the
first
time
I
found
my
writing
style
transcending
language
barriers.
I
found
myself
actually
developing
ideas,
analysis
and
even
narratives
in
french,
as
opposed
to
merely
doing
exercises
that
stressed
vocabulary
word
usage
and
mastery.
I
had
always
been
interested
in
language,
and
the
ability
of
groups
of
people
to
communicate.
I
was
also
curious
about
thought
proesses
and
the
role
language
plays
in
the
expression
of
ideas.
I
received
a
lot
of
praise
for
my
work,
and
enjoyed
the
fact
that
I
was
able
to
communicate
comfortably
in
another
language.
When
I
got
to
Lafayette
College,
I
thought
that
the
writing
would
be
extremey
advanced.
I
had
heard
all
the
horror
stories
about
the
outrageous
reading
assignments
and
the
intensive
analysis
that
was
demanded
by
the
collegiate
english
curriculum.
I
experienced
my
usual
degree
of
anxiety...as
a
seventeen
year
old,
I
thought
that
my
ideas
might
not
be
as
a
part
of
the
learning
experince,
and
I
value
knowing
other
people's
ideas
and
viewpoints.
I
also
enjoy
just
talking
to
my
peers
and
professors,
whether
it
be
in
the
classroom,
or
at
an
infromal
meeting--it
is
always
interesting
to
see
how
they
respond,
and
it
helps
my
understanding
of
the
text
in
question.
I
have
had
two
writing
associates,
who
have
both
been
helpful,
because
they
helped
me
focus
my
ideas
in
some
cases,
and
at
times
just
gave
me
reassurance
in
my
writing.
The
classes
I
have
taken
have
been
very
varied,
ranging
from
Chaucer
to
contemporary
Black
writers;
works
from
a
specific
decade
(ie
1890s)
to
a
single
genre
(contemporary
detective
fiction).
The
fact
that
the
courses
have
been
so
different
has
exposed
me
to
many
styles
of
writing,
and
helped
me
to
define
the
styles
and
genres
that
I
prefer
to
read
and
write.
I've
had
a
lot
of
good
experiences,
grown
as
a
writer,
and
been
exposed
to
many
and
sometimes
very
unique
ideas.
