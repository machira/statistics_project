Writing
From
the
Hip
Balthe
surveyed
the
plain
in
front
of
him.
Across
the
entire
expanse,
not
a
single
creature
moved.
Dozens
of
men
lied
there,
most
of
them
gazing
up
at
the
fading
sunset
with
vacant
stares.
In
the
twilight,
the
pools
of
blood
surrounding
them
took
on
an
eerie
purple
hue.
Huge
swaths
of
grass
had
been
trampled
flat
on
the
sides
of
the
road
by
the
feet
of
those
men.
Lord
Til's
battle
standard
remained
standing
in
one
of
the
largest
flattened
areas.
Balthe
gestured
silently,
and
a
member
of
his
retinue
rode
out
to
retrieve
the
banner.
I
shut
down
the
computer
and
shook
my
head
in
disgust.
For
days,
I
had
been
attempting
to
build
off
of
this
paragraph,
only
to
remove
everything
I
had
added
because
it
failed
to
flow
well,
or
seemed
too
cliched,
or
felt
wrong.
I
stared
at
the
keyboard
for
a
long
time
as
I
realized
just
how
massive
a
project
I
had
undertaken-I,
a
mere
college
freshman,
was
attempting
to
write
a
full-length
novel.
Not
just
any
novel
either,
but
one
that
would
raise
serious
questions
within
the
reader's
mind.
I
wanted
to
write
a
book
that
I
would
enjoy
reading.
Something
that
I
would
enjoy
reading.
Every
piece
of
writing
that
has
ever
flowed
from
a
pen
in
my
hand
or
has
been
punched
out
on
a
keyboard
laying
in
front
of
me
has
been
created
with
that
thought
in
mind.
From
the
useless
"write
about
your
summer
vacation"
assignments
in
elementary
school
to
my
senior
term
paper
studying
the
effects
of
Catholicism
on
James
Joyce's
novels,
I
have
striven
to
create
works
that
I
would
want
to
read
more
than
once.
Although
this
desire
to
make
every
essay,
poem,
or
paper
a
good
one
has
resulted
in
a
great
deal
of
lost
sleep
and
the
deaths
of
dozens
of
innocent
trees
to
meet
my
demands
for
paper,
I
have
never
turned
in
an
assignment
that
I
felt
was
without
merit
or
re-readability.
Many
people
have
pointed
out
the
close
relationship
between
reading
and
writing.
I
am
acutely
aware
of
this
congruency,
since
I
have
seen
it
within
myself
many
times
over
the
years,
although
until
recently
the
writing
has
lagged
behind
the
reading.
The
talents
I
had
in
both
reading
and
writing,
as
well
as
the
disparity
between
the
two,
was
apparent
at
an
extremely
early
age.
To
say
that
I
was
a
precocious
reader
as
a
youth
would
probably
be
an
understatement.
I
was
reading
typical
children's
books,
such
as
The
Cat
in
the
Hat,
before
I
entered
nursery
school.
By
the
beginning
of
first
grade,
I
was
reading
complete
Hardy
Boys
stories
in
under
three
hours
and
remembering
details.
This
was
the
time
when
I
first
began
writing.
Although
none
of
my
early
attempts
survive
and
I
remember
them
very
sketchily
at
best,
I
do
recall
that
they
were
stronger
and
more
organized
than
anything
my
peers
produced.
My
development
as
a
reader
and
a
writer
continued
at
a
withering
pace.
In
third
grade,
where
most
of
my
classmates
were
just
beginning
to
develop
a
basic
writing
style
and
fragments
were
a
dime
a
dozen,
I
was
actively
revising
my
works
and
would
deliberately
use
fragments
for
effect.
Between
Thanksgiving
and
Easter
of
that
year,
I
read
more
than
half
of
the
Old
Testament,
and
I
very
rarely
had
to
use
a
dictionary
to
figure
out
what
a
word
meant.
Once
I
entered
middle
school,
my
writing
abilities
slowly
began
to
catch
up
to
my
reading
skills.
I
began
to
understand
and
use
the
idea
of
subtlety,
though
it
would
take
me
a
long
time
to
master.
My
comparisons
also
became
more
precise
and
more
graphic,
and
I
learned
the
concept
of
using
words
to
create
vivid
images
in
the
reader's
mind.
Most
of
these
breakthroughs
came
in
seventh
grade.
The
first
assignment
I
received
that
year
was
to
compare
myself
to
an
inanimate
object,
beginning
with
the
phrase
"I
am
a
_____."
Although
I
believe
the
exercise
was
intended
mainly
as
a
creative
piece
and
to
help
the
teacher
gain
some
insight
about
who
we
were.
I,
however,
saw
this
assignment
as
not
just
a
creative
exercise
but
also
as
a
chance
to
evaluate
myself
critically.
Most
of
my
classmates
picked
commonplace
objects,
such
as
pens
or
cars.
I
remember
sifting
through
my
mind
for
the
perfect
analogy,
for
the
one
object
in
all
the
world
that
most
closely
represented
me.
After
about
fifteen
minutes,
I
found
it.
I
would
compare
myself
to
an
oil
well.
I
made
all
sorts
of
analogies
about
the
solitude
and
the
endurance
of
the
well
and
how
those
traits
applied
to
me.
I
remember
that
the
teacher
was
impressed
with
my
unusual
choice
and
how
I
developed
the
idea.
I
even
remember
my
grade,
a
49
out
of
50.
I
lost
one
point
for
not
spacing
the
heading
correctly.
The
biggest
writing
assignment
for
that
year
was
to
write
a
Hallowe'en
short
story.
Although
the
style
was
a
bit
abrupt
and
the
plot
was
hardly
the
most
original
ever
concocted,
I
received
a
perfect
grade.
I
used
a
variety
of
transitions,
even
though
no
one
had
ever
taught
me
about
them.
I
had
received
only
minimal
instruction
in
grammar
to
this
point,
almost
exclusively
of
the
"this
is
the
subject,
this
is
the
predicate"
variety.
I
was
developing
the
one
technique
which
has
ever
since
served
as
the
foundation
for
my
writing
style-forming
sentences
by
ear.
It
was
also
around
this
time
that
I
began
my
first
truly
creative
writing,
undertaken
not
as
part
of
a
school
assignment
but
for
my
own
benefit.
From
eighth
through
tenth
grade,
very
little
changed
in
terms
of
my
writing.
Although
I
was
constantly
picking
up
new
words
for
my
vocabulary,
I
was
not
learning
anything
about
writing.
I
continued
to
write
creatively,
especially
poetry.
I
realize
now
that
my
focus
on
poetry
was
due
to
the
fact
that
I
had
not
received
any
formal
training
in
the
various
styles
of
writing.
Very
little
had
been
mentioned,
yet
alone
taught,
about
critical
writing
or
even
good
narrative
writing
at
this
stage
of
my
academic
career.
Indeed,
I
had
more
training
in
the
field
of
"scientific"
writing
than
in
any
other
area.
My
potential
was
obvious,
but
it
remained
unharnessed;
the
proverbial
"diamond
in
the
rough."
My
junior
year
of
English
class
began
with
a
crash
course
in
grammar.
Real
grammar.
Not
the
same
simplistic
things
I
had
been
hearing
since
second
grade,
but
more
complicated
ideas,
such
as
parallelism
errors,
predicate
nouns,
transitions,
and
passive
voice.
Finally,
I
was
learning
the
reason
why
a
certain
sentence
didn't
sound
right.
Although
I
was
(and
still
am)
more
concerned
with
what
someone
has
to
say
than
how
that
person
says
it,
I
gained
a
new
perspective
on
writing
as
my
class
finished
the
introductory
grammar
lessons.
Throughout
the
semester,
the
teacher
constantly
harped
on
grammar,
even
at
the
expense
of
content.
I
remember
vividly
one
assignment
in
which
each
member
of
the
class
was
required
to
write
an
autobiography.
I
wrote
what
I
felt
was
an
excellent
paper
and
turned
it
in.
When
I
received
the
corrected
composition,
I
was
shocked
to
see
that
I
had
nearly
failed.
At
the
end
of
the
paper,
the
teacher
wrote
a
comment
that
ran
along
these
lines.
"Brad,
of
all
the
papers
I
read,
yours
was
the
most
interesting
and
smoothest
reading.
Unfortunately,
the
FCAs
[grammar
considerations]
rule."
To
me,
this
was
a
completely
insane
way
to
run
an
English
class.
Although
I
could
see
the
merit
in
striving
to
improve
my
grammar,
to
ignore
content
would
only
hurt
my
writing.
The
next
major
undertaking
in
this
English
class
was
critical
writing.
I
greatly
enjoy
the
unbounded
development
of
my
ideas,
which
I
am
free
to
do
in
creative
writing.
I
had
nothing
but
contempt
for
the
entire
idea
of
critical
writing.
I
wanted
to
write
about
topics
of
my
choosing,
not
about
how
the
narrator
changed
throughout
A
Farewell
to
Arms
or
the
significance
of
Willy's
hallucinations
about
Ben
in
Death
of
a
Salesman.
This
"limited"
style
of
writing,
combined
with
the
fanatical
obsession
over
grammar,
nearly
had
me
climbing
the
walls
in
my
English
class.
The
only
assignment
I
really
enjoyed
was
my
term
paper
on
Orson
Scott
Card.
In
this
paper
I
was
to
identify
elements
of
style
he
used
in
two
separate
books,
research
professional
criticisms
of
these
elements,
and
then
write
responses
to
the
criticisms.
Although
this
was
still
primarily
a
critical
piece,
I
leapt
at
the
opportunity
to
create
and
express
my
own
views.
The
paper
was
supposed
to
be
twelve
pages
long;
my
finished
paper
was
just
over
twice
that
length,
and
earned
one
of
the
highest
grades
in
the
class.
Despite
all
the
progress
I
made
as
a
writer
my
junior
year,
the
strides
I
made
my
senior
year
dwarf
all
of
my
previous
accomplishments.
The
teacher
of
my
AP
English
class,
Mr.
Cohen,
had
a
reputation
for
being
a
near-impossible
grader,
and
he
informed
us
on
the
first
day
of
class
that
he
would
not
be
afraid
to
give
us
negative
grades
on
compositions
if
we
made
enough
errors.
Mr.
Cohen's
English
is
grammatically
flawless,
and
in
the
six
years
I
have
known
him
I
could
count
on
one
hand
the
number
of
times
he
has
made
an
error
while
speaking.
I
have
never
seen
him
make
a
mistake
in
writing.
His
goal
was
to
make
us
the
best
writers
we
could
be,
and
I
believe
that
he
succeeded.
Mr.
Cohen
quickly
identified
my
personal
bugbear-writing
in
passive
voice.
I
had
become
so
entrenched
in
my
writing
habits
that
I
was
completely
unaware
that
the
passive
voice
dominated
my
essays.
Mr.
Cohen
systematically
dissected
every
single
piece
I
wrote
that
year,
showing
me
every
single
instance
of
passive
voice
and
forcing
me
to
rewrite
the
sentence
in
the
active
voice.
Although
I
cringed
at
some
of
the
grades
I
earned
on
my
early
essays,
I
learned
how
to
identify
the
passive
voice
in
my
own
writings
and
I
slowly
eliminated
it.
By
the
time
I
wrote
my
college
essays
in
the
late
fall
and
my
senior
term
paper
in
the
winter,
the
passive
voice
had
all
but
disappeared
from
my
writings.
The
other
major
flaw
in
my
writings
that
Mr.
Cohen
was
quick
to
point
out
was
my
"tendency
to
bullshit
about
nothing
before
getting
around
to
the
topic
at
hand."
The
focus
of
the
AP
class
was
on
critical
writing,
which
left
very
little
room
for
developing
interesting
but
irrelevant
paragraphs.
Once
I
understood
this
idea,
I
realized
that
I
had
to
radically
adapt
my
writing
style
if
I
had
any
intention
of
passing
the
course.
Throughout
the
year,
I
ground
away
at
the
irrelevancies
in
my
writing,
and
I
discovered
something
incredible.
I
had
practiced
the
changes
Mr.
Cohen
had
recommended
to
such
an
extent
that
I
was
carrying
out
those
changes
when
I
wrote
by
ear.
These
changes
became
even
more
obvious
when
I
began
writing
my
college
essays,
as
the
more
juvenile
aspects
of
my
writing
disappeared.
The
crowning
moment,
however,
came
on
the
day
that
seniors
were
to
turn
in
essays
as
potential
graduation
speeches.
I
had
been
so
wrapped
up
with
various
activities
that
I
had
forgotten
about
the
assignment,
and
I
realized
that
I
had
not
yet
written
anything
a
mere
fifteen
minutes
before
the
essay
was
due.
Although
I
had
a
vague
idea
of
what
I
wanted
to
say,
I
did
not
even
have
an
opening
sentence.
Remaining
calm,
I
sat
myself
in
front
of
a
computer
in
the
library
and
began
typing.
Two
minutes
before
the
deadline,
I
printed
out
and
turned
in
my
essay.
A
couple
weeks
later,
Mr.
Cohen
informed
me
that
my
speech
was
one
of
four
that
had
been
chosen
to
be
delivered
at
commencement.
Mr.
Cohen
then
told
me
that
my
speech
had
received
the
highest
rating
of
the
four
selected
and
asked
me
how
much
time
I
had
spent
on
it.
I
have
rarely
seen
him
as
surprised
as
when
I
told
him
that
I
had
spent
under
fifteen
minutes
on
it.
"Brad,"
he
told
me,
"this
speech
is
concise
and
direct.
It's
the
best
writing
I've
ever
seen
you
do."
With
only
a
couple
minor
modifications,
it
was
the
same
speech
that
I
delivered
at
the
commencement
ceremony
in
June.
I
am
tremendously
proud
of
that
speech,
and
though
my
ideas
are
what
made
it
great,
I
would
not
have
been
able
to
express
them
as
well
as
I
did
without
Mr.
Cohen's
help.
Since
I
have
arrived
at
college,
my
writing
style
has
changed
only
slightly.
Although
I
still
prefer
to
do
most
of
my
writing
"from
the
hip,"
I
have
become
better
at
organizing
my
thoughts
in
advance
to
avoid
the
long
periods
of
writer's
block
that
have
plagued
me
in
the
past.
My..First-Year
Seminar
class
seemed
ridiculously
easy
after
my
experiences
in
high
school.
This
statement
is
not
an
attack
on
the
standards
of
the
writing
program
here
at
Lafayette,
but
rather
a
tribute
to
the
excellent
job
which
my
high
school
did
in
preparing
me
for
highly
demanding
writing.
I
am
no
longer
a
diamond
in
the
rough,
but
a
finely
cut
stone
that
could
stand
just
a
little
bit
of
polishing.
As
for
the
piece
in
the
beginning
of
this
essay?
Well,
I
was
able
to
develop
my
ideas
for
several
pages
before
I
stalled
again.
For
now,
at
least,
that
project
has
been
relegated
to
the
back
burner
in
favor
of
completing
my
studies.
