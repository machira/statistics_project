My
Writing
Journey
A
wide-ruled
notebook
and
a
pencil
and
the
willingness
to
write
anything
and
everything
I
was
asked
were
my
first
memories
of
writing.
Of
course,
the
stakes
were
low,
as
I
was
only
entering
the
starting
gates
of
my
writing
journey.
As
I
moved
on
from
elementary
school
to
middle
school,
I
noticed
that
my
nervousness
towards
writing
rose
as
the
expectations
rose.
Little
did
I
know
that
the
expectations
would
continue
to
rise
as
high
school
was
right
around
the
corner.
My
writing
journey
has
certainly
had
its
ups
and
downs,
but
I
have
had
some
great
mentors
and
helpful
tips
to
help
me
to
where
I
am
today
on
my
journey.
Freshman
year
at
my
public
high
school
came
as
a
shock
to
me
because
I
never
received
much
help
with
my
writing
from
my
middle
school
teachers.
The
cookie
cutter
five
paragraph
essays
and
I
did
not
get
along
and
my
nerves
traveled
at
full
speed
every
time
I
sat
down
to
write
a
paper.
The
onset
of
writerOs
block
was
a
common
occurrence
for
me.
My
writing
confidence
continued
to
dwindle
and
I
began
to
think
that
anything
writing
related
was
far
from
my
calling
in
life.
I
was
self-conscious
because
I
felt
as
though
I
was
never
writing
that
perfect
essay
teachers
always
wanted
me
and
my
classmates
to
write.
I
was
always
worried
about
upsetting
both
myself
and
my
teachers
every
time
I
turned
in
an
essay.
This
made
for
less
than
enjoyable
nights
spent
on
what
I
thought
to
have
been
NdifficultO
papers.
I
felt
that
my
writing
was
taking
a
sharp
turn
for
the
worse.
I
knew
that
it
was
time
to
make
some
changes
if
I
wanted
to
have
a
better
experience
with
my
schoolwork
and
in
particular,
my
writing.
After
my
junior
year
at
public
high
school,
I
decided
to
transfer
to
The
Hill
School,
which
is
a
preparatory
school
in
Pottstown,
PA.
The
transition
was
a
shock
to
my
system
and
the
level
I
was
expected
to
perform
at
rose
even
more.
However,
I
decided
that
with
my
fresh
start,
I
would
welcome
the
new
challenges
with
newfound
confidence.
The
summer
reading
before
my
first
year
at
Hill
was
Joyce
Carol
OatesO
Black
Water
and
a
short
essay
to
complete
for
the
first
day
of
English.
On
that
first
day,
I
was
welcomed
by
my
English
teacher
who
graduated
from
Hill,
attended
Yale,
and
then
completed
her
graduate
work
at
the
Bread
Loaf
School
of
English
at
Middlebury.
I
was
impressed
and
pretty
intimidated
to
say
the
least.
I
turned
the
summer
essay
in
with
a
bit
of
apprehension,
but
hoped
it
would
at
least
partially
fulfill
the
high
expectations.
During
the
first
few
days
of
class,
my
teacher
gave
some
advice
that
was
essential
in
kick
starting
my
confidence
again
towards
writing.
She
stated
that
it
was
more
than
okay
for
a
writer
to
not
know
what
they
are
actually
writing
about
until
they
reach
the
end
of
the
paper.
A
rapid
fire
of
thoughts
basically
boiled
down
to
these
few
questions,
NWhat
do
you
mean?
How
do
you
start
writing
if
you
donOt
know
what
you
are
going
to
write
about?
Huh?O
I
clearly
didnOt
get
it.
We
were
assigned
an
exercise
that
could
have
had
a
completely
different
reaction
from
each
student.
That
night,
I
just
started
to
let
the
thoughts
in
my
head
hit
the
paper
and
in
no
particular
order.
One
thought
led
to
another,
and
soon
I
realized
that
I
had
some
worthwhile
thoughts
written
down.
From
there,
I
teased
out
each
of
those
thoughts
by
trying
to
connect
personal
experiences
or
incorporating
other
evidence
that
I
had
to
back
up
my
thoughts.
Still,
my
response
was
very
rough
and
rather
disorganized,
but
it
was
the
best
start
of
a
paper
in
the
history
of
my
relatively
short
writing
journey.
I
worked
my
thoughts
together
and
started
by
writing
my
first
body
paragraph
as
opposed
to
my
thesis.
Body
paragraph
after
body
paragraph,
I
could
feel
what
writing
really
could
be
about!
I
didnOt
need
a
thesis
to
dictate
each
and
everything
I
was
going
to
write
from
then
on.
That
was
such
a
rewarding
experience
as
a
new
leg
of
my
writing
journey
started.
During
my
spring
vacation,
I
spent
three
weeks
in
South
Africa
and
Botswana
with
my
mom.
We
spent
a
few
days
in
Johannesburg,
and
then
went
on
safari
for
two
weeks
in
different
parts
of
Botswana.
At
the
end
of
the
trip,
we
spent
a
few
days
in
Cape
Town.
Throughout
the
trip,
my
mom
made
me
keep
a
diary
of
everything
I
did
each
day.
Back
then,
I
sort
of
complained
because
I
didnOt
really
want
to!
With
an
action
packed
three
weeks,
there
is
no
way
that
I
would
be
able
to
remember
everything
that
we
did.
I
am
grateful
that
my
mom
required
me
to
do
this.
The
reflection
each
evening
was
just
as
fun
as
the
day
itself,
as
I
got
to
replay
the
kill
we
saw
happen
one
day
on
safari
D
two
lionesses
killing
a
kudu.
In
my
journal,
I
tried
to
incorporate
every
single
detail
that
I
remembered
from
that
event
because
it
is
very
rare
for
people
to
actually
see
a
kill
happen.
My
journal
was
casually
written
because
I
knew
that
I
was
not
going
to
be
graded
or
anything,
but
I
think
that
it
may
have
been
some
of
my
most
descriptive
writing.
As
I
read
my
previous
entries,
I
was
able
to
reflect
upon
all
the
amazing
things
that
I
encountered
throughout
my
trip.
I
will
have
that
journal
forever
and
occasionally
revisit
it.
At
the
end
of
the
school
year,
each
of
us
were
given
our
summer
essays
on
Black
Water
and
our
NbestO
paper
of
the
year
as
a
comparison
exercise.
When
we
got
our
Black
Water
papers
back,
I
was
surprised
that
there
were
no
comments
on
them,
but
our
NbestO
papers
had
tons
of
red
markings
all
over
them.
I
read
my
summer
essay
first
and
then
my
NbestO
paper.
The
overall
structure,
the
complexity,
and
basically
everything
else
were
dramatically
different
between
the
two
papers.
Our
teacher
had
obviously
left
the
summer
essays
unmarked
because
she
knew
that
we
would
be
able
to
pinpoint
the
various
differences.
That
was
a
special
way
for
each
student
to
come
to
new
conclusions
without
being
told
word
for
word
what
to
think
or
do.
Writing
is
much
like
growing
up
because
we
always
have
changes
and
improvements
that
happen
over
time.
Our
NbestO
papers
had
many
markings
on
them,
yet
that
was
not
a
bad
thing.
Instead,
it
was
a
sign
that
even
though
they
were
considered
our
NbestO,
we
still
had
places
that
could
have
been
stronger.
Our
teacher
was
able
to
move
past
the
basic
errors
from
our
summer
papers
and
instead
focus
on
other
aspects
that
could
have
been
improved
by
explaining
our
thoughts
more
thoroughly
or
adding
more
details.
Since
then,
I
have
kept
that
whole
learning
curve
in
the
back
of
my
mind
and
it
has
been
quite
helpful
for
me.
During
my
Sixth
Form
year
at
Hill,
I
was
in
a
journalism
class
taught
by
a
former
editor
of
The
Washington
Post.
I
was
not
exactly
sure
what
this
class
would
be
like,
but
I
thought
that
it
might
incorporate
the
various
aspects
of
writing.
That
class
involved
the
things
that
I
thought
it
would
D
plus
a
lot
more.
We
read
articles
from
the
local
paper
and
pointed
out
the
strengths,
weaknesses,
and
what
we
would
change.
Short
writing
assignments
almost
on
a
daily
basis
were
normal,
followed
by
peer
editing.
My
teacher
was
the
faculty
advisor
to
our
school
newspaper,
and
even
had
asked
me
if
I
would
be
interested
in
becoming
the
Editor
of
the
paper.
NMe?
EditEthe
school
paper?
UhEsure!O
All
I
could
think
about
was
my
rocky
start
with
writing
and
where
I
was
on
that
day
I
had
been
asked
to
join
the
paper.
To
say
that
I
was
Nadequately
preparedO
for
college
writing
is
an
absolute
understatement!
However,
I
do
not
think
that
I
would
have
felt
that
prepared
had
I
not
changed
schools
and
had
a
better
overall
education.
I
was
surrounded
by
writing
no
matter
what
class
I
was
in.
Also,
as
a
member
of
the
Honor
Council
where
the
fate
of
students
who
had
committed
honor
violations
was
in
my
hands,
I
learned
how
to
write
in
a
way
that
I
had
only
heard
on
episodes
of
Law
and
Order.
The
style
in
which
we
were
required
to
write
for
the
Honor
Council
could
be
considered
another
mile
marker
on
my
writing
journey
because
it
was
different
than
any
English,
science,
or
even
math
paper
that
I
had
ever
written.
Additionally,
I
served
as
a
member
of
the
Writing
Fellows
group
which
I
would
consider
to
be
my
best
experience
as
a
writer
thus
far.
A
Writing
Fellow
does
most
of
the
same
things
as
a
Writing
Associate
does
here
at
Lafayette.
Students
would
come
up
to
the
Writing
Center
which
was
in
the
Harry
Potter-like
library
(perfect
for
getting
your
writing
juices
flowing)
and
ask
the
Fellows
to
read
over
their
papers,
give
suggestions
about
where
their
paper
could
be
improved
or
supported
more,
or
point
out
parts
that
we
thought
were
great.
Occasionally,
I
had
students
visit
me
who
were
completely
stuck
on
how
to
begin
their
papers.
Those
particular
students
reminded
me
a
lot
of
myself
from
a
few
years
prior,
and
I
always
gave
them
the
same
advice
my
teacher
had
given
me
in
the
past.
These
meetings
were
difficult,
however,
because
Fellows
had
to
figure
out
how
to
approach
these
sessions
so
that
the
students
got
the
most
out
of
them.
This
did
not
come
easily,
however,
because
our
initial
reaction
is
to
want
to
mark
up
the
papers
and
get
lost
in
them.
I
found
out
that
that
approach
makes
it
seem
like
your
meeting
is
with
the
piece
of
writing,
rather
than
the
person
and
then
their
writing.
That
definitely
took
some
time
to
get
used
to,
but
I
quickly
realized
that
the
more
that
the
student
was
engaged
in
the
meeting,
the
more
beneficial
it
was.
For
me,
writing
is
more
than
just
physically
writing
words,
a
paragraph,
or
an
essay.
I
think
that
it
is
also
incorporates
elements
of
reading,
brainstorming,
and
editing
among
others.
Without
one,
you
cannot
have
the
other
and
each
element
is
extremely
important
to
the
big
picture.
This
is
why
I
consider
the
job
as
a
Writing
Fellow
to
be
a
part
of
my
writing
journey.
I
learned
a
lot
about
my
own
writing:
my
style,
my
many
weaknesses
as
well
as
my
strengths,
and
also
how
much
I
can
learn
just
from
reading
papers
written
by
other
people.
This
year,
I
am
also
looking
forward
to
adding
my
position
as
a
Writing
Associate
to
my
writing
journey
because
even
though
I
wonOt
necessarily
be
writing
paper
after
paper
for
this
position,
I
know
that
what
I
learn
from
helping
others
will
only
improve
my
own
writing.
What
I
know
about
writing
as
I
start
another
leg
of
my
writing
journey
is
that
I
am
by
no
means
anything
close
to
a
fantastic
writer.
As
I
mentioned
earlier,
my
writing
has
changed
immensely
and
will
continue
to
change.
I
think
that
an
open
mind
is
essential
when
it
comes
to
welcoming
these
new
changes.
Also,
I
appreciate
all
of
the
different
types
of
writing
that
I
have
either
been
required
to
do
because
they
have
all
helped
me
to
where
I
am
on
my
journey
today.
I
hope
that
as
a
Writing
Associate
I
am
able
to
help
other
students
realize
their
own
writing
history
and
journey
because
I
had
never
really
thought
about
my
own
and
it
has
been
worthwhile
to
reflect.
