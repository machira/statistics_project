Project
Writing
Like
a
WA
Does
your
title
of
Writing
Associate
imply
that
your
writing
is
flawless?
As
much
as
I
wish
my
writing
ability
were
impeccable,
being
a
WA
does
not
mean
that
I
have
learned
everything
about
the
writing
process.
I
emphasize
process
because,
even
as
a
third
year
WA,
I
have
learned
a
lot
from
the
Writing
Associate
staff,
my
students,
and
other
Writing
Associates.
As
every
year
passes,
my
writing
has
progressed
and
improved
through
my
rigorous
classes
and
through
many
experiences
as
a
Writing
Associate.
When
I
entered
my
junior
year
at
Lafayette
College
I
thought
that
I
had
mastered
all
aspects
of
writing.
I
had
taken
a
first
year
seminar,
first
year
writing
course,
two
English
classes,
and
a
plethora
of
biology
and
chemistry
courses,
and
I
believed
that
writing
in
another
course
at
Lafayette
would
have
been
already
covered.
Therefore
when
I
was
registered
for
Sociology
101
I
thought
that
the
writing
would
be
easy.
Sociology
was,
traditionally,
a
class
reserved
for
first
year
students,
so
I
did
not
expect
any
level
of
writing
difficulty.
My
theory
that
I
was
a
writing
genius
was
challenged
when
I
encountered
writing
difficulty
with
my
first
paper
in
Sociology
101.
When
I
received
the
writing
assignment,
my
first
thought
was
you
have
got
to
be
kidding
me.
My
initial
concern
was
not
in
writing
the
paper,
but
understanding
the
assignment.
Initially,
I
believed
that
I
could
handle
the
assignment
without
any
help.
Soon
after,
though,
I
realized
that
I
could
not
write
anything
coherent
if
I
could
not
even
understand
the
assignment.
After
many
visits
with
my
professor,
I
was
able
to
understand
the
assignment
and
create
a
piece
of
writing
that
was
admirable.
The
professor
of
my
Sociology
course
challenged
my
outlook
that
only
papers
written
in
the
natural
sciences
were
structured
as
lab
reports.
In
fact,
he
wanted
this
research
paper
set
up
similarly
to
lab
reports
that
I
had
written
in
biology
courses.
With
this
paper,
I
found
myself
seeking
help
with
many
sources
such
as
my
professors,
friends,
and
other
Writing
Associates.
In
addition,
I
found
myself
following
the
advice
that
I
give
my
students
in
WA
conferences.
For
this
paper,
I
found
that
writing
multiple
drafts
greatly
improved
and
assisted
the
development
of
my
final
paper.
In
the
day
of
writing
papers
at
the
last
minute,
my
advice
to
my
students
is
to
write
a
series
of
drafts
before
turning
in
a
paper.
I
believe
that
writing
drafts
increases
the
probability
that
mistakes
will
be
found
and
that
improvements
will
be
made.
Although
I
strongly
believe
in
multiple
drafts,
I
rarely
write
them
because
I
do
not
have
the
time.
Writing
the
Sociology
paper
forced
me
to
take
my
own
WA
advice
and
reminded
me
of
what
impact
my
job
could
have
on
other
students.
Sociology
101
did
not
hold
the
only
writing
challenge
that
I
met
last
year.
In
addition,
my
Spanish
course
posed
a
threat
to
my
writing
confidence.
Spanish
courses
had,
traditionally,
been
easy
to
handle.
Last
year
I
was
challenged
to
write
coherent
papers
in
Spanish.
Far
from
the
small
paragraphs
that
only
had
to
be
grammatically
correct,
these
papers
had
to
follow
the
general
rules
of
papers
that
I
had
written
in
English.
Not
only
did
the
writing,
itself,
pose
a
challenge,
but
having
a
WA
assigned
to
the
course
challenged
my
own
writing
identity.
Similar
to
the
Sociology
class,
I
found
myself
turning
to
my
professor
for
help
and
to
the
Writing
Associate
that
was
assigned
to
the
class.
I
challenged
myself
to
drop
the
WA
facade
of
being
the
perfect
writer"
and
to
find
writing
assistance
when
it
was
needed.
As
a
WA
you
have
to
face
criticism
and
realize
that
your
writing
has
flaws.
Facing
another
WA,
as
a
WA,
can
be
a
very
difficult
experience
if
you
do
not
enter
the
conference
with
an
open
mind.
This
experience
was
not
new
to
me
because
I
had
taken
a
course
where
a
WA
was
assigned
to
meet
with
the
class.
The
first
experience
was
difficult,
but
I
realized
that
having
a
Writing
Associate
was
helpful.
As
a
writer,
you
cannot
always
recognize
your
mistakes
or
areas
for
improvement
due
to
the
sheer
amount
of
time
that
you
have
put
into
the
paper.
It
is
difficult
to
mindfully
read
and
criticize
your
own
paper
when
you
have
already
read
it
multiple
times.
I
found
that
seeking
a
WA
as
a
WA
was
an
advantage
because
I
knew
what
questions
to
ask
the
WA
about
common
mistakes
that
might
be
found
in
my
paper.
Although
your
writing
may
not
be
perfect,
you
have
been
chosen
to
be
a
Writing
Associate
because
you
have
qualities
that
are
valuable
to
aiding
the
writing
of
other
students.
This
job
lays
many
responsibilities
on
your
shoulders
such
as
being
approachable,
receptive,
organized,
and
willing
to
help
other
students.
You
are
not
expected
to
be
a
perfect
writer.
In
addition
to
the
classes
that
I
took
last
year,
I
met
with
many
students
who
challenged
my
confidence
as
a
writer
and
as
a
writing
associate.
For
instance,
I
met
with
a
first
year
student
who
presented
me
with
an
outstanding
paper
from
his
first
year
seminar.
I
was
truly
amazed
at
the
ability
of
this
student
and
frightened
of
the
thought
that
I
could
not
give
him
any
helpful
advice.
As
the
conference
progressed,
I
realized
that
I
had
the
ability
to
answer
his
questions
and
provoke
many
new
ideas
that
had
not
crossed
his
mind.
A
conference
should
not
be
run
with
the
WA
giving
the
advice
and
the
student
listening.
Instead,
a
conference
is
an
opportunity
to
generate
ideas
from
each
other.
The
student
needs
to
think
during
the
conference
in
order
for
it
to
be
a
really
productive
and
rewarding
one.
In
the
case
of
this
student,
I
even
experimented
with
some
aspects
of
his
writing
style
in
my
own
writing.
A
writing
associate
should
take
advantage
of
each
conference
and
not
fear
what
they
will
bring.
In
contrast
to
the
student
that
comes
to
the
conference
with
the
perfect"
paper,
I
met
with
a
student
who
had
unusual
difficulties
writing.
Some
may
think
that
this
is
the
ideal
student
to
work
with,
but
in
reality
it
is
an
extremely
difficult
situation.
In
this
case
I
was
faced
with
a
student
who
did
not
want
to
be
in
a
conference
with
me
and
admitted
to
me
that
he
had
not
met
with
his
WAs
the
previous
year.
He
thought
that
the
only
purpose
of
Writing
Associates
were
to
take
time
away
from
the
busy
students.
I
felt
some
sort
of
responsibility
to
show
the
student
that
Writing
Associates
could
be
helpful
and
to
actually
get
the
student
to
think
about
his
own
writing
and
to
find
his
own
writing
identity.
This
opportunity
was
one
of
the
most
crucial
because
the
writing
fate
of
one
student
rested
in
my
hands.
After
I
finally
persuaded
the
student
to
give
me
a
copy
of
his
paper,
we
made
an
appointment
to
meet.
He
did
not
come
to
his
first
meeting,
so
I
called
him
and
explained
to
him
that
the
meeting
was
the
most
important
part
of
the
WA
experience.
When
we
met,
I
knew
that
he
was
uncomfortable
because
he
sat
across
the
table
instead
of
beside
me.
Right
away
I
reinforced
his
writing
strengths,
which
seemed
to
calm
him
and
even
provoked
a
smile.
Then
I
found
that
he
did
have
a
lot
of
questions
about
the
assignment
and
portions
of
his
paper.
After
meeting
with
him
several
times,
he
became
more
confident
about
his
writing
and
I
saw
that
he
was
developing
his
own
style.
For
instance,
he
began
his
papers
with
a
story,
or
scene,
that
became
characteristic
of
many
of
his
subsequent
papers.
At
the
end
of
the
semester,
I
felt
that
our
meetings
were
very
successful
and
it
made
me
realize
that
a
Writing
Associate
needs
to
treat
each
student
differently
because
they
all
have
different
strengths
and
weaknesses.
In
addition,
I
gained
confidence
that
I
could
help
other
students
with
their
writing.
There
are
many
students
who
you
will
meet
with
who
will
surprise
you
with
their
writing
abilities.
Some
of
these
students
may
write
poorly
and
others
may
write
better
than
you
may.
As
a
WA,
you
must
be
prepared
for
these
instances
and
not
fear
meeting
with
those
students.
Think
of
these
students
as
an
advantage
to
you
as
a
Writing
Associate
and
as
a
writer.
First,
you
have
the
ability
to
help
out
students
and
see
many
mistakes
that
are
common
in
college
writing.
You
then
have
the
knowledge
of
those
errors
and
have
an
advantage
of
deleting
them
from
your
own
writing.
Second,
you
can
experiment
with
suggestions
and
ideas
from
talented
writers.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
gives
you
this
advantage
that
other
students
in
the
Lafayette
community
do
not
have.
With
your
new
title
of
Writing
Associate,
do
not
close
your
mind
to
criticism
and
new
ideas
because
your
writing
is
constantly
improving.
