My
2004-2005
Writing
Experience
My
sophomore
year
of
college
proved
full
of
diverse
writing
experiences.
This
is
largely
because
of
my
position
as
a
W.A.
Thinking
back
on
my
first
conferences
with
my
FYS
students,
I
find
myself
laughing
and
relieved.
I
put
a
huge
amount
of
effort
into
those
first
conferences,
which
I
now
see
more
hindered
my
work
than
helping
it.
I
am
relieved
spending
forty-five
minutes
reading
each
paper
is
excessive
and
that
I
am
now
actually
comfortable
in
my
station
as
a
WA.
Whether
or
not
I
am
comfortable
in
my
position
as
a
writer
is
a
more
difficult
and
complex
inquiry.
Before
entering
my
sophomore
year,
my
writing
narrative
consisted
of
many
successful
and
positive
experiences
and
only
a
few
weak
points.
I
feel
that
this
year
has
strengthened
my
writing
ability
by
revealing
areas
of
weakness
and
difficulty
because
this
only
allows
for
improvement.
One
of
the
first
lessons
from
my
WA
conferences
was
that
there
are
infinite
ways
to
approach
any
one
assignment.
In
my
early
conferences,
I
often
maintained
certain
expectations
for
how
the
students
would
tackle
and
complete
the
writing
assignment.
For
example,
in
one
assignment
the
students
were
to
write
about
a
particular
bridge
and
its
importance
and
significance.
My
initial
response
was
to
expect
papers
with
a
typical
outline
of
initial
background
and
structural
information
followed
by
the
reasons
the
bridge
is
useful.
The
papers
I
received
ranged
from
personal
experiences
with
bridges
to
practical
explanations
to
technical
analysis,
yet
they
all
answered
the
assignment.
This
variety
of
responses
to
one
assignment
not
only
helped
me
as
a
WA
by
showing
me
the
value
of
being
open-minded,
but
also
influenced
my
own
approach
to
answering
assignments.
The
option
of
answering
an
assignment
by
different
means,
which
I
began
to
understand
in
September/October,
set
the
precedent
for
the
direction
my
writing
would
take.
If
I
had
to
summarize
my
2004-2005
writing
experiences
in
one
phrase,
it
would
be
that
I
perfected
the
process
of
choosing
the
correct
angle
to
answer
an
assignment
or
rather
what
I
like
to
call,
Nmaking
writing
my
own.O
My
fall
semester
of
Literary
Women
provided
an
atmosphere
in
which
this
skill
could
flourish.
The
assignments
often
included
the
chance
to
choose
particular
aspects
of
books
or
passages
on
which
to
write.
In
one
paper,
I
narrowed
my
focus
to
the
relationships
between
mothers
and
daughters
within
our
readings.
This
concept
developed
from
the
idea
that
one
can
approach
an
assignment
from
many
different
angles.
I
found
that
for
me,
the
key
to
successful
writing
was
finding
the
angle
that
appealed
to
me.
This
would
create
an
interest
in
what
I
was
writing
that
made
it
seem
easy.
Two
benefits
of
this
technique
were
that
it
allowed
me
to
have
a
feeling
of
control
and
that
it
decreased
the
anxiety
in
getting
a
paper
started.
I
found
that
many
of
my
WA
students
would
complain
that
they
had
a
hard
time
Ngetting
started.O
I
would
try
to
help
them
find
an
angle
they
liked
to
approach
the
assignment,
as
I
had
learned
to
do.
If
that
failed,
then
I
would
tell
them
to
write
anything
because
even
if
you
do
not
like
it,
then
you
can
at
least
move
away
from
it.
My
writing
in
my
Literary
Women
course
exposed
a
weakness
in
my
writing
that
I
found
quite
challenging.
My
professor
pointed
out
to
me
that
in
my
literary
analysis
papers,
my
writing
lacked
the
necessary
evidence
to
support
my
claims.
Providing
evidence
within
my
papers
became
a
grueling
dilemma.
I
could
see
that
my
instructor
was
correct
in
her
criticism,
but
I
still
struggled
to
adjust
my
writing.
While
writing
a
paper,
I
would
feel
that
my
point
was
clear
with
sufficient
evidence,
but
when
looking
it
over
later,
I
would
see
that
I
had
not
properly
articulated
what
I
was
trying
to
say.
I
received
feedback
that
I
was
improving,
but
I
was
not
yet
comfortable
with
including
evidence
within
my
writing.
In
my
spring
semester
of
my
sophomore
year,
I
would
again
face
the
issue
of
providing
evidence
for
my
literary
claims
through
my
Literary
History
course.
In
this
course,
almost
every
week
I
had
to
write
a
paper
analyzing
the
texts
we
read.
My
first
paper
analyzed
one
of
ShakespeareOs
sonnets,
and
I
thought
that
I
was
in
the
clear
since
I
had
read
and
analyzed
this
poem
before.
My
professor
was
not
impressed
with
my
paper
and
her
biggest
concern
was
my
lack
of
direct
evidence
supporting
what
I
was
claiming.
For
my
second
paper,
I
decided
that
I
needed
a
new
method
for
attacking
this
problem.
I
decided
to
try
typing
my
main
ideas
about
the
reading
out
without
much
reference
to
the
text,
which
would
result
in
a
few
paragraphs
of
my
own
ideas
about
the
essay
topic.
Then,
I
would
go
back
through
the
paper,
adding
textual
evidence
and
examples
in
appropriate
areas.
This
process
needed
some
fine-tuning,
but
my
grade
improvement
showed
that
it
had
worked.
Whenever
I
face
a
literary
analysis,
I
at
least
list
my
main
ideas
out
before
further
construction
of
my
paper.
This
allows
me
to
separate
my
own
ideas
from
things
said
in
the
text
so
that
I
can
avoid
repetition.
In
addition
to
attaining
the
ability
to
include
appropriate
evidence
through
my
Literary
History,
there
was
another
aspect
of
writing
I
gain
through
this
class.
The
audience
of
a
typical
college
writing
assignment
is
either
the
professor
or
another
group
implemented
by
the
professor.
Because
of
this,
I
often
designed
my
writing
specifically
to
fulfill
what
I
would
perceive
to
be
a
professorOs
ideal
paper.
However,
through
my
work
as
a
WA
and
my
higher-level
classes
of
my
sophomore
year,
I
learned
the
possible
danger
of
believing
in
an
ideal
paper.
In
my
Literary
History
class,
I
began
to
write
on
topics
that
interested
me,
which
altered
the
objective
of
my
writing.
No
longer
was
I
simply
writing
for
Nthe
A,O
but
I
also
began
to
write
to
express
how
I
thought
and
felt
about
a
particular
issue.
Writing
was
no
longer
a
chore
or
task
to
perform,
but
a
tool
of
expression
to
utilize.
Now
that
I
have
discussed
several
personal
writing
advancements,
I
must
address
my
V.A.S.T.,
which
I
had
in
the
spring
of
my
sophomore
year.
While
I
was
so
triumphantly
including
evidence
in
my
new
matured
writing
process
in
my
Literary
History
class,
I
was
also
experiencing
difficulty
carrying
out
the
creative
assignments
in
my
V.A.S.T.
The
three
major
papers
in
my
V.A.S.T.
consisted
of
a
non-fiction
personal
narrative,
an
ethical
analysis/opinion
paper,
and
a
fictional
short
story.
Each
of
these
assignments
contained
thorny
components
that
I
rarely
faced,
especially
the
last
one.
The
first
assignment
was
similar
to
this
narrative
assignment
except
that
it
was
on
a
more
personal
issue.
This
was
my
first
experience
in
writing
to
a
professor
on
a
personal
topic
where
I
was
encouraged
to
use
an
informal
tone.
Although
allowed
freedom
of
expression,
we
were
not
to
make
the
narrative
as
informal
as
when
writing
in
a
personal
journal.
Understanding
my
audience
was
difficult
and
I
needed
to
find
a
balance
in
my
tone
to
accommodate
the
ambiguous
nature
of
the
assignment.
I
felt
apprehension
about
the
feedback
I
would
receive
from
my
professor
because
most
of
the
paper
consisted
of
opinions
I
held
about
myself.
I
was
pleased
when
my
professor
assured
me
that
what
I
was
trying
to
express
was
coherent
and
palpable.
The
second
paper
of
my
V.A.S.T.
demanded
that
I
use
text
and
movies
to
compile
my
own
opinion
on
medical
ethics.
This
was
not
a
typical
research
paper
nor
was
it
simply
a
literary
analysis,
but
rather
a
combination
of
both.
While
forming
my
own
separate
opinions
from
those
in
the
text
and
movies,
I
still
needed
to
present
and
discuss
the
ideas
with
in
these
sources.
By
adding
this
twist,
the
experience
proved
to
cement
my
ability
to
include
proper
evidence
in
my
writing.
The
final
paper
of
my
V.A.S.T.
was
the
most
difficult
assignment
of
my
college
career
thus
far.
The
idea
of
creating
a
story
with
a
unique
and
interesting
beginning,
middle,
and
end
was
extremely
intimidating
to
me.
I
still
shy
away
from
the
thought
of
it.
In
my
education
on
writing,
I
have
rarely
received
instruction
on
how
to
go
about
writing
a
story.
This
story
was
to
be
fictional,
which
is
much
different
from
the
non-fiction
personal
narratives
I
have
written.
Even
now,
I
feel
that
my
short
story
lacked
any
kind
of
a
plot.
This
is
a
problem
I
had
experienced
in
my
senior
year
of
high
school
when
assigned
to
write
my
own
NCanterbury
Tale.O
For
my
V.A.S.T.
story,
I
found
myself
simply
trying
to
include
any
suggestions
my
professor
had
made
to
the
class.
This,
however,
still
did
not
give
my
story
any
degree
of
a
plot.
Struggling
with
this
type
of
story
is
frustrating
to
me
because
I
love
to
imagine
that
some
day
I
will
retire
and
spend
my
days
as
a
novelist.
However,
as
of
now
this
does
not
seem
practical
since
I
feel
so
inadequate
in
fictional
writing.
I
tried
my
best
to
work
through
my
struggles
with
my
V.A.S.T.
papers,
but
the
best
means
to
ease
my
struggles
was
my
W.A.
After
being
a
W.A.
for
at
least
a
semester,
I
fell
in
love
with
the
idea
of
having
my
own
personal
W.A.
for
my
V.A.S.T.
Being
a
W.A.
myself,
increased
my
appreciation
of
having
a
W.A.
by
ten-fold.
Because
of
my
complete
understanding
of
the
W.A.
process,
I
was
able
to
utilize
a
W.A.
in
full
without
any
inhibitions.
My
W.A.
was
my
greatest
tool
for
my
writing
because
whenever
I
was
unsure
about
something,
I
would
simply
ask
her.
Even
if
I
disagreed
with
what
she
said
or
if
she
did
not
have
an
answer
for
me,
it
at
least
got
a
discussion
started
that
usually
helped
me
in
some
way.
Being
a
W.A.
myself
is
what
created
my
eagerness
for
outside
help
from
my
peers.
Even
when
I
did
not
have
a
W.A.
for
a
course,
I
would
always
make
a
point
to
talk
about
an
assignment
to
a
classmate
or
friend.
This
would
start
a
discussion
similar
to
those
in
a
conference
that
drives
the
flow
of
ideas.
From
my
experience,
I
can
say
that
the
College
Writing
Program
is
a
marvelous
device
(and
not
only
because
as
a
W.A.,
I
am
supposed
to
say
that).
As
a
W.A.,
I
find
myself
attempting
Nto
W.A.O
my
own
papers,
but
this
is
a
difficult
process.
It
is
difficult
to
change
oneself
from
the
position
of
the
voice
to
the
audience,
which
is
what
I
would
need
to
do
in
order
to
review
my
own
paper
as
a
W.A.
However,
the
more
papers
I
read
as
a
W.A.,
the
more
I
find
myself
naturally
making
this
switch
to
read
over
my
own
papers.
Common
errors
that
I
saw
in
conference
papers
like
colloquialism
or
weak
endings
became
easier
to
spot
within
my
own
writing.
This
process
is
often
helpful
in
finding
errors
or
weaknesses
within
a
paper,
but
it
lacks
the
component
of
discussion
that
allows
for
solutions.
Therefore,
attempting
Nto
W.A.O
my
own
paper
is
typically
rather
frustrating.
The
final
type
of
writing
that
I
experienced
in
my
sophomore
year
was
that
of
biology
lab
reports.
I
have
written
lab
reports
in
the
past,
but
they
were
typically
not
too
formal
or
long.
It
was
different
to
write
for
a
science
class
because
I
felt
that
my
writing
lacked
any
type
of
style.
It
was
more
like
listing
facts
in
sentences
instead
of
expressing
a
point.
I
struggled
with
this
because
as
a
writer,
I
wanted
to
be
able
to
include
style
in
a
paper,
even
if
it
was
a
lab
report.
Although
the
response
of
my
lab
instructor
was
positive,
I
was
not
satisfied.
However,
this
may
just
be
a
difference
in
the
genres
of
writing.
In
my
previous
writing
narrative,
I
ended
by
discussing
my
inability
to
end
a
paper.
This
is
something
that
I
still
struggle
with,
but
have
noticed
definite
improvement.
Being
a
W.A.
has
given
me
the
opportunity
to
read
many
papers
with
both
good
and
bad
endings.
How
a
paper
should
conclude
was
topic
of
discussion
in
almost
every
one
of
my
W.A.
conferences,
so
I
feel
less
intimidated
by
my
own
apprehensions
about
endings.
Trouble
with
ending
papers
now
seems
quite
typical
and
not
terribly
serious.
For
me,
I
always
struggle
with
endings
for
a
bit,
but
can
usually
determine
the
best
way
to
go
about
it
with
a
little
time
and
thought.
Overall,
I
am
quite
impressed
with
my
2004-2005
writing
experiences.
My
sophomore
year
was
significant
in
that
it
included
a
variety
of
types
of
writing
and
reading
other
studentsO
writing.
I
am
most
proud
about
the
level
of
maturity
in
my
writing
that
I
described.
Writing
is
important
to
me
and
I
know
that
even
though
I
am
not
an
English
major,
it
will
be
important
in
my
career
in
the
medical
field
that
I
am
able
to
express
myself
comprehensively
to
a
variety
of
audiences.
