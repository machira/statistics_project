"My
House"
This
is
my
house.
It's
gone
through
some
changes,
but
I
have
lived
here
all
my
life.
The
front
door
opens
into
the
foyer.
To
the
right
is
the
living
room
and
dinning
room
is
further
on.
Straight-ahead
are
the
kitchen
and
the
door
to
the
basement
stairs.
To
the
left
are
the
family
room
and
the
staircase
to
the
second
floor.
Off
the
family
room
is
the
study
with
a
small
collection
of
trophies.
My
bedroom
and
my
parents'
bedroom
are
located
on
the
upper
level.
There
is
a
lot
of
history
in
this
house.
When
I
was
a
baby,
my
room
was
next
to
my
parents'
bedroom.
It
had
big
blue
and
white
striped
wallpaper
on
the
bottom
half
of
white
walls
with
a
pink
and
white
striped
boarder
running
around
the
room.
All
my
stuffed
animals
were
on
the
dresser
next
to
the
bookshelf.
My
favorite
stuffed
animal
was
a
brown
camel
that
my
uncle
had
gotten
for
me
when
he
was
in
India
on
a
business
trip.
I
loved
that
camel.
I
am
sure
once
it
was
soft
and
fluffy,
but
now
the
fur
is
clumped
and
knotted
with
years
of
child
loving.
My
camel
reminds
me
of
the
first
paragraph
I
recall
writing
when
I
was
in
first
grade.
The
teacher
wrote
on
the
board
a
paragraph
about
camels
and
their
humps.
We
copied
the
sentences
down
in
our
best
penmanship
on
that
paper
with
two
blue
solid
lines
and
then
a
dotted
red
line
in
the
middle.
The
other
paper
we
used
sometimes
was
the
yellow
paper
with
blue
lines.
We
would
write
one
letter
over
and
over
again
and
the
teacher
would
star
the
best
looking
ones.
I
still
have
those
papers
in
a
box
somewhere
in
the
attic.
When
I
grew
too
old
for
the
crib,
my
parents
put
in
a
child's
bed
and
painted
the
walls
yellow.
In
the
bookshelf
were
my
favorite
books,
some
souvenirs,
and
photographs
of
me
and
my
family.
My
books
were
on
the
second
to
last
shelf
-
There
Are
Rocks
in
My
Socks.
The
Girl
With
the
Silver
Eves,
and
The
Elephant
Who
Couldn't
Sneeze.
On
the
shelf
above
was
a
piece
of
birch
bark
from
Madawaska
where
my
grandparents
from
Canada
and
my
family
would
go
camping
in
the
summer.
Next
to
that
was
a
plastic
model
of
the
Statue
of
Liberty
that
I
picked
out
from
the
souvenir
store
after
we
climbed
her
with
my
other
grandparents.
I
remember
that
day
vividly.
The
day
before,
we
drove
to
New
York
City
to
my
grandparents'
house
in
the
Bronx.
When
we
arrived
at
my
grandparents1
they
had
dinner
ready
set
on
the
table.
My
grandmother
made
the
best
Chinese
food
I
have
ever
tasted.
We
went
to
bed
early
because
the
next
morning
we
were
getting
up
early
to
drive
to
the
ferry.
The
line
at
the
base
of
the
statue
seemed
a
mile
long,
but
I
remember
it
not
waiting
nearly
as
long
as
we
had
anticipated.
What
I
had
not
expected
was
the
obnoxiously
long
time
it
took
to
walk
up
all
the
stairs.
Older
people
always
take
too
long,
or
maybe
I
was
too
anxious.
I
finally
got
to
the
top
and
looked
out
a
window
in
her
crown.
Everything
is
so
small
from
up
high
but
at
the
same
time
so
expansive.
The
horizon
goes
on
forever.
I
wrote
a
paper
in
elementary
school
about
New
York
City.
I
remember
sitting
at
the
kitchen
table
and
asking
my
mother
about
the
city
while
she
made
dinner.
I
remember
a
line
I
wrote
that
the
greatest
resource
New
York
City
had
to
offer
was
me
(I
was
born
in
Brooklyn).
The
teacher
gave
me
an
"A"
on
that
assignment.
I
think
my
mother
was
more
pleased
than
I
was
when
it
was
handed
back.
The
highest
shelf
was
filled
with
pictures
of
me
from
birth
to
fifth
grade.
Mom's
favorite
picture
is
one
of
her
and
I
in
the
kitchen.
We're
standing
at
the
table
and
she
is
helping
me
make
cookies.
Whenever
I
wanted
to
make
cookies
we
would
gather
all
the
ingredients
first
and
then
mix
them
together.
Mom
always
helped
with
the
mixer
but
I
put
the
dough
on
the
cookie
sheets.
In
fifth
grade
I
added
a
desk
lamp
to
my
bedroom
furniture.
Since
the
desk
was
at
the
end
of
the
bed
I
used
to
turn
the
lamp
around
so
that
I
could
read
at
night.
The
lamp
now
sits
on
the
desk
in
the
study.
My
dad
made
one
of
the
rooms
on
the
first
floor
into
an
office
space
with
his
collection
of
books
and
important
papers.
The
showcase
on
the
far
wall
houses
the
family
awards.
I
have
two
trophies
on
the
shelf.
One
is
the
first
place
award
that
my
friend
Jessica
and
I
won
for
a
biography
we
wrote
together
in
fifth
grade.
The
assignment
was
to
write
a
biography
based
on
information
given
to
us
about
an
author
who
was
coming
to
our
school.
Our
paragraph
was
chosen
to
introduce
the
author.
I
remember
being
surprised
that
we
were
chosen
because
I
was
not
confident
in
my
writing
skills
at
that
point
in
my
life.
I
also
did
not
think
much
of
the
assignment
and
had
not
put
much
effort
into
its
completion.
Perhaps
I
should
have
been
proud
of
my
work,
but
at
the
time
I
was
embarrassed
and
did
not
want
any
public
acknowledgement
for
having
written
the
speech.
I
believe
in
fifth
grade,
those
excelling
in
academics
were
alienated
from
mainstream
students.
No
one
wants
to
be
excluded
from
his
or
her
peers,
especially
in
elementary
school
when
academic
ambition
has
not
kicked
in
yet.
Although
I
did
not
acknowledge
it
at
the
time,
this
was
the
first
occasion
that
I
had
been
recognized
as
a
talented
writer.
To
the
right
of
that
award
is
another
writing
accomplishment,
a
certificate
for
best
fictional
story
in
a
creative
writing
contest
I
entered
in
high
school.
It
was
a
typical
Hollywood
hacker
plot
-
main
character
hacks
into
some
government
agency
and
transfer
funds
from
one
organization
to
another
more
worthy
cause,
authorities
track
him
and
he
tries
to
undo
the
damage
while
avoiding
being
caught.
I
remember
thinking
that
my
story
was
unoriginal
and
childlike.
Even
after
I
won
I
still
doubted
my
accomplishment
thinking
that
maybe
all
the
other
entries
were
terrible.
It
was
only
after
I
started
receiving
compliments
from
readers
that
it
occurred
to
me
that
I
had
written
a
well-developed
and
truly
enjoyable
story.
I
learned
two
lessons
from
that
experience.
One
lesson
is
to
try.
When
something
seems
impossible
or
unattainable,
the
only
thing
you
can
do
is
try
and
be
pleasantly
surprised.
Sometimes
a
writing
assignment
seems
difficult
to
tackle,
but
if
I
attempt
it,
usually
it
is
not
as
bad
as
I
originally
thought.
The
other
lesson
is
I
have
writing
talent
and
to
be
confident
of
that
fact.
I
continued
to
make
excuses
for
my
story
even
after
I
was
told
it
was
excellent.
The
quality
of
writing
stems
from
attitude.
A
negative
attitude
writes
a
poorly
composed
paper,
but
a
positive
attitude
pulls
out
the
best
ideas
for
the
most
creative
papers.
Let's
get
a
snack
while
I
show
you
the
kitchen.
I
am
a
terror
in
the
kitchen.
If
there
is
an
open
flame
I
am
burning
something.
I
can
not
read
directions
and
somehow
I
manage
to
get
ingredients
pretty
much
anywhere
but
in
the
pan.
Eleventh
grade
in
high
school
was
the
ultimate
low
point
of
my
writing-self-esteem.
I
was
taking
English
AP
I
and
not
doing
so
well.
No
matter
how
hard
I
tried
I
was
not
producing
"A"
material.
There
were
times
I
would
be
so
frustrated
that
I
wanted
to
give
up
trying,
but
instead
I
saw
each
test
and
paper
an
opportunity
to
show
the
teacher
I
could
write
well.
I
would
not
say
that
approach
paid
off
because
the
only
"A"
paper
I
wrote,
on
Pride
and
Prejudice,
was
in
the
middle
of
the
year.
I
never
felt
I
learned
anything
in
that
class.
My
writing
did
not
improve
and
I
do
not
remember
anything
we
discussed
about
the
literature.
There
was
criticism
but
it
was
not
constructive,
and
there
never
was
instruction
on
how
to
improve.
I
felt
like
a
test
subject
in
a
maze
with
no
map
to
get
out.
Meanwhile
someone
is
yelling
at
me
to
hurry
up
and
find
my
way
out.
Finally
a
helicopter
lifted
me
out
of
that
maze
and
into
senior
year
English
honors.
Compared
to
the
year
before
this
place
was
a
grassy
field
next
to
a
stream
on
a
sunny
day.
Let's
sit
down
for
a
minute
in
the
family
room.
I
love
this
beanbag
chair.
It's
so
comfortable
and
it's
perfect
for
lying
around
in
on
lazy
days.
Anyway,
senior
year
was
a
breeze.
Every
paper
I
wrote
received
the
letter
grade
it
deserved,
and
they
were
mostly
"A"s.
I
remember
distinctly
on
the
last
day
of
class
the
teacher
talking
about
college,
high
school
graduation,
and
about
the
past
year.
He
said
he
thought
I
was
only
person
who
was
really
comfortable
with
their
writing
style
and
was
prepared
for
college
writing.
Perhaps
that
should
go
in
the
trophy
case
as
well.
I
was
surprised
and
proud
of
that
comment,
but
mostly
it
described
my
motive
for
taking
the
class.
On
the
one
hand
I
had
proved
to
myself
that
I
could
write
well,
and
that
compliment
allowed
me
to
forget
the
low
writing-self-esteem
I
had
picked
up
from
the
year
before.
I
also
knew
the
reason
I
was
taking
English
honors
instead
of
English
AP
II
was
because
it
was
easier
and
I
knew
I
would
do
better
in
the
honors
class.
My
plan
was
successful
and
I
did
receive
an
"A"
in
the
class,
but
college
was
coming
up
quickly.
Let
me
show
you
the
rest
of
the
house.
Over
here
is
the
newest
part
of
the
house,
the
sunroom.
When
they
first
started
it
you
could
not
recognize
what
it
was
going
to
be.
The
place
was
a
mess
and
there
was
construction
equipment
in
the
house
and
in
the
yard.
It
was
not
until
the
furniture
was
moved
in
that
the
room
really
started
to
take
shape.
They
started
tearing
down
the
outside
wall
at
the
beginning
of
my
freshman
year
at
college.
Not
being
able
to
justify
the
mess
and
confusion
of
the
construction
until
its
completion
describes
very
well
my
First
Year
Seminar
course
in
college.
I
thought
I
was
prepared
for
writing
at
the
college
level,
but
my
grades
suggested
something
else.
This
was
also
the
first
time
I
had
been
introduced
to
the
concept
of
discussing
the
paper
with
a
Writing
Associate
or
a
professor
as
a
way
to
improve
it.
At
the
time,
the
exercises,
the
revisions,
the
criticism,
and
the
instruction
seemed
meaningless
and
unhelpful.
I
could
not
appreciate
that
the
changes
the
professor
was
trying
to
make
in
my
writing
style
were
ones
that
would
upgrade
me
to
the
college
level.
The
instruction
was
there
but
I
could
not
understand
it
to
apply
it.
I
did
what
I
was
told
without
realizing
that
renovations
were
being
made
to
my
writing.
Since
FYS
my
writing
has
changed
considerably.
Not
only
do
I
write
differently
but
I
approach
writing
assignments
differently.
I
make
a
conscious
effort
to
remember
what
my
FYS
professor
told
me
in
conferences
and
to
apply
that
to
my
writing
assignments.
I
am
still
learning
and
improving.
College
writing
is
like
this
sunroom,
part
of
the
house
and
full
of
light.
This
is
my
favorite
room
because
all
you
can
see
out
the
windows
is
sky.
Every
time
I
look
at
the
sky
it
is
different.
I
love
sleeping
out
here
and
waking
up
to
the
sunrise.
The
day
seems
much
better
when
you
wake
up
with
it.
Every
writing
assignment
is
a
new
opportunity
to
improve
just
like
each
new
day
holds
new
beginnings.
There
is
one
more
place
I
want
to
show
you.
This
is
the
door
to
the
basement.
For
a
long
time
I
was
scared
of
going
down
here.
When
I
was
little
my
mom
would
hold
my
hand
so
I
would
not
fall
down
the
stairs.
When
I
was
older
she
would
make
me
go
down
here
to
get
food
out
of
the
freezer.
I
would
turn
on
all
the
lights,
run
as
fast
as
I
could
to
the
freezer,
grab
whatever
it
was
she
needed,
and
run
all
the
way
back.
I
would
slam
the
door
shut
in
hopes
that
nothing
would
follow
me
and
I
would
not
have
to
go
down
there
again.
As
I
got
older
I
became
braver
and
started
exploring
the
basement.
I
found
lots
of
interesting
things
down
in
some
of
the
boxes.
Two
or
three
years
ago
I
asked
my
parents
if
I
could
fix
up
one
of
the
rooms
down
there
and
make
my
own.
They
agreed
and
I
have
been
working
on
it
ever
since.
I
repaired
the
walls
and
the
light
fixtures,
painted
the
walls,
and
set
up
some
furniture.
The
place
still
needs
work
but
I
look
forward
to
the
challenge
of
making
it
a
relaxing
place
for
me
to
do
work
on
some
of
my
hobbies.
I
have
a
couple
of
creative
ideas
for
decorating
the
room
but
I
can
not
decide
on
one
and
I
am
always
thinking
of
new
ideas.
This
room
is
special
to
me
because
it
is
my
own.
I
can
make
it
anything
I
want
and
it
is
different
from
all
other
rooms.
So
that
is
my
house.
You
will
have
to
come
visit
when
my
play
room
is
complete.
