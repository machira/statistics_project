Literary
Narrative
Looking
Back
I
recently
climbed
up
to
our
attic,
looking
for
one
of
my
old
toys
that
I
wanted
to
show
my
younger
sister.
As
I
sat
digging
through
the
boxes,
I
came
across
several
labeled
"School
Papers."
My
mother
had
kept
my
papers
from
kindergarten
through
high
school.
I
started
sorting
through
the
boxes
of
papers
as
memories
of
my
school
years
began
flashing
through
my
head.
My
kindergarten
papers
were
mostly
drawings
and
small
storybooks
with
only
one
word
on
each
page.
Our
first
writing
assignment
was
to
spell
our
names.
Luckily
for
me,
I
had
a
fairly
"normal"
name,
which
I
shortened
to
"Jessie."
We
learned
words
as
we
learned
the
alphabet;
C
is
for
Cat
and
D
is
for
Dog.
Most
of
my
papers
were
very
colorful
-
crayons
were
just
prettier
than
a
plain
old
pencil.
By
first
grade,
writing
became
more
important.
We
even
received
a
grade
for
penmanship!
I
sifted
through
a
folder
of
yellow
papers.
Each
paper
was
divided
in
half.
The
top
was
a
blank
space
for
drawing
a
picture
and
the
bottom
contained
lines
for
printing
a
sentence
or
two
about
the
picture.
Most
of
my
stories
were
about
my
pets
or
family.
Cursive
writing
began
in
second
grade.
I
remember
how
frustrated
I
would
get.
I
could
never
get
my
letters
to
look
like
the
ones
in
the
penmanship
book.
Despite
the
difficulty
with
cursive,
my
stories
were
getting
longer
as
my
vocabulary
and
ability
to
express
my
ideas
grew.
My
writing
continued
to
improve
throughout
the
rest
of
my
elementary
school
years.
Most
of
my
writing
was
fiction.
I
paged
through
a
book
I
had
made
in
fifth
grade
to
enter
in
a
contest.
It
had
been
bound
and
had
my
own
illustrations
-
it
is
a
good
thing
I
never
wanted
to
become
an
artist!
There
were
also
newspaper
clippings
of
when
I
had
entered
the
Sentinel's
"Kids
Speak
Out"
contest.
Every
week
our
local
newspaper
invited
kids
to
write
a
reaction
to
a
question
they
had
presented.
If
your
writing
was
published
you
received
a
free
T-shirt.
I
had
collected
several
over
the
years.
My
first
experience
with
writing
non-fiction
and
researching
a
topic
occurred
in
fifth
grade.
I
had
to
do
a
report
on
Calvin
Coolidge.
I
took
my
notes
on
index
cards,
made
an
outline,
and
then
combined
everything
into
a
five-page
paper.
I
had
really
enjoyed
doing
research
and
from
that
point
on
my
best
writing
encompassed
some
form
of
research.
I
smiled
as
I
closed
up
the
box
with
my
elementary
school
papers.
My
teachers
and
parents
had
instilled
within
me
the
desire
to
learn.
I
had
enjoyed
writing
stories
and
reading
them
to
someone.
I
pulled
out
another
box
-
middle
school
-
argh!
Middle
school
was
definitely
the
roughest
time
of
my
school
career.
There
were
so
many
changes
and
the
homework
had
definitely
increased.
I
wrote
a
variety
of
things
in
middle
school,
but
the
topics
were
not
always
of
my
choosing.
I
did
get
back
into
my
love
of
researching
though
when
I
entered
the
History
Day
competition.
I
did
not
quite
know
what
I
was
getting
myself
into
when
I
started
researching
information
on
abolitionists
and
Frederick
Douglass.
I
went
to
the
Shippensburg
University
library
to
look
up
old
newspaper
and
magazine
articles
and
print
them
out
on
microfilm.
I
ended
up
with
a
25-page
paper
with
25
references.
The
paper
won
at
the
local
competition
and
I
advanced
to
the
state
competition.
The
paper
had
been
a
lot
of
work,
especially
since
it
had
not
been
for
a
class
-1
still
had
all
that
work
to
do
too.
Another
good
thing
to
come
out
of
my
middle
school
experience
was
peer
editing.
I
had
always
had
my
mother
read
over
my
writing
-
she
still
is
my
best
editor
-
but
I
also
had
my
classmates
review
my
work.
I
was
a
tough
peer
editor.
My
friends
said
I
had
a
photographic
memory
of
our
grammar
book.
When
I
reached
high
school,
I
not
only
became
much
happier,
but
my
writing
also
blossomed.
The
English
department
at
my
high
school
was
phenomenal.
In
ninth
grade
I
read
several
Shakespeare
plays
and
wrote
reviews
on
all
of
them.
We
also
had
a
unit
on
the
Holocaust,
which
included
visiting
the
museum
in
Washington,
D.C.
Seeing
evidence
of
such
tragedies
provoked
meaningful
writings
from
the
entire
class.
I
entered
the
Scholastic
Writing
Contest
for
the
first
time
in
ninth
grade.
I
decided
to
try
writing
science
fiction.
My
story
was
about
computers
controlling
cars.
Ironically
my
story
is
becoming
a
reality,
now
several
years
later.
My
story
ended
up
winning
a
National
Silver
Key.
I
would
not
say
that
the
story
is
my
best
piece
of
writing.
I
entered
the
contest
other
years
with
things
I
thought
were
much
better,
but
I
never
won
again.
I
had
the
opportunity
to
take
Honors
English
classes
my
junior
and
senior
years
in
high
school.
They
were
very
challenging,
but
prepared
me
well
for
college.
Getting
my
first
paper
back
in
my
junior
English
class
was
an
eye-opening
experience.
I
was
used
to
getting
A's,
but
this
paper
was
marked
with
a
"C."
As
the
semester
progressed,
my
grades
got
better
and
I
guess
my
writing
did
too.
We
did
a
lot
of
analyses
and
critiques
of
literary
works.
We
also
did
peer
editing
-
with
a
twist.
Our
papers
were
always
submitted
anonymously
and
before
they
received
a
grade
they
were
passed
around
the
class
so
each
person
could
read
them
and
comment.
By
the
end
of
the
year
it
was
easy
to
determine
the
authors
of
the
papers.
Some
of
my
most
memorable
and
favorite
writings
occurred
in
these
English
classes.
The
most
unique
paper
I
wrote
was
for
an
assignment
called
"The
Last
Line."
We
each
wrote
a
quote
on
a
card,
put
them
in
a
hat,
and
then
drew
out
a
card.
We
had
to
construct
a
story
that
ended
with
that
quote.
I
had
an
extremely
hard
quote
from
Thoreau,
but
I
managed
to
write
a
decent
story.
I
also
did
a
very
beneficial
research
paper
my
senior
year
on
colleges.
I
compared
location,
cost,
financial
aid,
and
academic
programs
of
five
colleges.
The
paper
helped
me
decide
on
Lafayette.
My
high
school
writing
experiences
did
not
end
in
the
classroom.
My
ninth
grade
English
teacher
convinced
me
to
join
the
staff
of
the
literary
magazine.
A
year
later
I
was
editor.
The
magazine
taught
me
to
work
with
people
who
had
vastly
different
personalities.
I
learned
how
to
put
together
a
magazine
-
from
design
to
deciding
on
the
contents.
My
weakness
was
with
poetry.
I
never
understood
many
of
the
poems
and
definitely
could
not
write
one
myself.
There
were
many
frustrating
moments
and
early
mornings
before
school,
but
when
an
issue
came
out,
it
was
worth
it.
The
magazine
also
received
honors
from
the
National
Council
of
Teachers
of
English.
My
interest
in
research
and
non-fiction
writing
led
me
to
work
part-time
as
a
reporter
for
the
local
newspaper.
I
wrote
articles
mostly
about
school
events.
Being
familiar
with
my
assignments
made
it
easier
for
me
to
write
an
article.
I
was
never
able
to
be
on
the
staff
of
the
school
newspaper
because
it
was
a
class
and
I
did
not
have
room
in
my
schedule
for
it.
The
last
paper
in
my
high
school
box
was
written
for
my
last
day
of
high
school.
Graduation
speakers
are
selected
from
anonymously
submitted
speeches.
I
decided
to
write
a
speech
about
how
successful
my
classmates
had
been
over
the
past
four
years
and
how
successful
they
could
be
in
the
future.
My
speech
was
selected
and
I
was
honored
to
present
it
on
graduation
night.
Closing
the
box,
I
left
high
school
and
entered
the
world
of
college.
I
had
decided
to
major
in
chemical
engineering.
I
guess
it
seems
pretty
odd
for
someone
that
was
involved
so
heavily
in
writing
activities
to
choose
a
technical
major,
but
that
is
what
happened.
Math
and
science
just
came
natural
to
me
and
writing,
although
I
was
pretty
good
at
it,
seemed
more
like
a
task.
I
had
received
the
FYS
course
that
I
had
wanted
on
German
history.
It
was
definitely
not
the
most
exciting
FYS
course,
but
I
was
interested
in
Germany
and
especially
the
period
in
history
surrounding
WWII.
My
process
of
writing
a
paper
changed
while
I
was
taking
this
course.
Previously
I
had
written
my
papers
out
by
hand
and
then
typed
them.
Now
I
just
started
typing
away
at
a
computer.
I
found
out
that
I
was
a
slow
writer.
I
like
to
write
a
good
first
draft.
I
do
not
usually
have
to
change
much
on
a
next
revision.
Because
of
this,
I
had
to
start
my
papers
weeks
ahead
of
when
they
were
due.
I
was
not
like
my
roommate
who
could
write
one
a
couple
of
days
before
it
was
due.
I
had
my
first
interaction
with
a
WA
in
my
FYS
course.
I
thought
it
was
a
neat
program
that
Lafayette
had
established.
I
usually
did
not
have
to
change
much
to
my
papers,
but
it
was
good
to
get
some
feedback
on
them.
I
also
wrote
my
first
collaborative
paper
in
my
FYS.
A
friend
and
I
analyzed
a
movie
that
we
had
watched
in
class.
It
was
weird
working
on
something
together.
The
paper
went
okay,
but
I
still
prefer
to
write
alone.
The
quality
of
my
FYS
papers
helped
me
get
exempt
from
College
Writing
110.
I
did
not
have
a
"writing"
course
again
until
my
junior
year
when
I
took
Engineering
and
Ethics.
However,
I
have
written
several
papers
in
my
technical
courses.
When
I
studied
abroad
in
Brussels,
I
took
a
chemistry
course
that
was
graded
on
two
papers.
Again,
I
got
to
do
something
I
enjoyed
-
research.
I
relied
heavily
on
the
Internet
for
information.
I
was
beginning
to
see
how
my
writing
abilities
were
playing
into
my
technical
degree.
This
year
I
will
take
on
a
large
writing
assignment.
I
am
going
to
do
an
honors
thesis
in
the
chemical
engineering
department.
Hopefully
my
liking
of
research
will
help
me
with
the
paper.
Unfortunately
the
technical
basis
of
the
paper
will
not
make
it
easy
reading
for
my
family
and
friends.
I
usually
like
to
share
my
writing
with
my
mother
and
boyfriend.
They
provide
good
criticism
and
appreciate
the
work
I
have
put
into
a
paper.
In
turn,
I
have
helped
my
boyfriend
with
some
of
his
papers
about
music.
I
am
also
excited
about
being
a
Writing
Associate
for
the
Engineering
department.
Engineers
need
to
be
strong
in
math
and
science,
but
they
also
need
to
communicate
what
they
know.
From
my
experiences
at
Lafayette
and
through
summer
internships,
I
have
had
to
use
my
writing
skills
constantly.
As
I
put
the
boxes
labeled
"School
Papers"
away
and
looked
for
the
ones
labeled
"Toys,"
I
realized
that
those
boxes
contained
years
of
memories
and
work
that
had
shaped
this
person
about
to
graduate
from
college.
Writing
has
not
always
been
my
favorite
thing
to
do,
but
it
has
allowed
me
to
gain
knowledge
on
a
variety
of
topics,
interact
with
others
and
communicate
my
ideas
effectively.
