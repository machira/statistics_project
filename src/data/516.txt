WA
Summer
Assignment
7/28/06
My
work
as
a
writer
from
August
of
2005
to
the
present
is
by
far
the
most
polished
to
date,
but
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
improvement.
As
I
entered
my
junior
year
at
Lafayette,
I
was
set
to
begin
a
very
difficult
academic
year.
I
had
registered
for
three
300-level
courses
in
the
fall
and
two
in
the
spring.
I
felt
intimidated
by
the
thought
of
having
to
take
a
semester
with
so
many
advanced
courses
and
unfamiliar
ideas.
Perhaps
my
most
difficult
writing
experience
of
the
year
was
my
semester
taking
a
class
on
Henry
James.
I
did
not
expect
the
course
to
be
too
difficult,
as
I
had
already
taken
a
couple
of
courses
with
the
same
professor.
I
was
wrong.
This
class
was
a
bit
more
challenging,
both
in
the
questions
asked
in
the
classroom
and
outside
of
it.
My
professor
described
our
class
as
a
composite
of
Henry
James
works
in
which
we
would
eventually
ask
ourselves
a
few
particular
questions:
NWhat
is
the
Jamesian
project?
Does
it
succeed?O
We
read
supplemental
essays
as
well
as
the
primary
texts
written
by
James
and
were
to
come
up
with
our
own
idea.
I
must
admit
I
had
a
hard
time
coming
up
with
an
opinion
when
it
came
time
to
write
my
own
papers.
At
times
it
was
maddening
for
me
to
think
of
an
argument
that
was
truly
original.
I
had
to
try
many
times
and
had
to
ask
myself
how
I
could
project
an
original
thought
onto
such
classic
texts.
I
had
always
had
an
easy
time
analyzing
and
debating
simpler
ideas,
but
when
it
came
to
searching
for
a
creative
angle
and
coming
up
with
a
compelling
idea,
I
found
myself
having
to
work
much
harder.
Yet
every
paper
I
had
to
write
for
the
Henry
James
course
called
for
an
original
argument,
something
the
professor
had
not
thought
of
before.
I
constantly
pushed
myself
to
navigate
my
way
through
the
texts,
often
with
frustrating
results.
At
times
I
felt
as
if
my
answers
were
simply
not
good
enough,
and
at
times
my
professor
agreed.
As
much
as
I
disliked
having
my
writing
challenged,
I
was
beginning
to
learn
an
important
lesson
about
originality.
Contrary
to
what
many
students
believe,
professors
do
not
look
at
their
studentsO
papers
with
one
particular
answer
to
a
question
in
mind.
Rather,
it
is
those
students
who
are
brave
enough
to
argue
for
an
original
point
who
are
most
often
rewarded.
It
is
the
free
thinkers
that
write
the
most
engaging
papers.
I
realized
this
after
writing
a
few
papers
for
the
Henry
James
course
and
began
to
trust
my
own
instincts.
Once
I
embraced
this
concept,
I
saw
results.
In
my
subsequent
papers,
my
professor
commended
me
for
having
my
own
take
on
an
issue
and
proving
it
both
carefully
and
thoroughly.
As
I
began
to
rely
on
my
own
thoughts,
I
found
it
easier
and
more
enjoyable
to
write.
Rather
than
feeling
stagnant
or
forced,
my
writing
started
to
flow
more
freely
and
felt
natural.
I
began
to
enjoy
writing
again.
This
revelation
served
me
not
only
in
my
Literary
History
course,
but
in
all
of
the
other
courses
I
was
taking
in
the
fall
of
my
sophomore
year.
In
my
Modern
&
Contemporary
poetry
course,
students
were
given
almost
complete
freedom
on
what
they
wrote
in
their
papers.
As
long
as
the
theses
related
to
one
or
more
of
the
poems
we
read
in
class,
the
professor
was
content
to
read
whatever
a
student
desired
to
talk
about.
At
first
I
was
nervous
to
proceed
with
a
paper
without
much
guidance,
but
as
I
carefully
dissected
passages
from
the
poems
I
read
and
saw
interesting
patterns,
finding
a
thesis
for
a
paper
became
less
intimidating.
As
I
gained
more
experience,
I
even
became
used
to
having
little
dictation
for
an
assignment.
In
fact,
when
I
was
faced
with
an
assignment
with
very
distinct
questions
and
criteria,
it
almost
felt
too
constraining
for
me.
I
finally
felt
free
to
explore
new
ground.
In
my
English
course
on
the
American
Renaissance,
the
students
were
encouraged
to
generate
their
own
thoughts
on
the
many
issues
brought
up
in
the
classroom.
My
professor
required
students
to
write
in
a
journal
outside
of
class
in
order
to
promote
free
thinking
and
allow
the
students
space
to
generate
material
for
the
final
projects
they
would
pursue
at
the
end
of
the
semester.
My
journal
became
a
kind
of
haven
for
my
thoughts
without
fear
of
interruption
or
distraction.
In
fact,
much
of
the
material
for
my
mid-semester
and
end-of-the-year
projects
came
from
notes
in
my
journal.
My
first
semester
of
my
third
year
at
Lafayette
helped
me
tremendously
in
gaining
independence
and
a
confidence
in
myself
as
a
writer
for
the
first
time.
As
a
junior
I
continued
my
responsibilities
as
a
Writing
Associate
with
a
promotion
to
Mentor.
I
was
assigned
to
a
First
Year
Seminar
on
Race
&
Class.
On
the
one
hand
I
drew
on
my
year
of
experience
as
a
WA
as
a
sophomore.
But
still
I
was
not
completely
confident.
I
was
worried
that
my
being
a
peer
rather
than
a
teacher
might
cause
the
students
to
be
resistant
to
my
suggestions
and
comments.
E
This,
however,
was
not
true.
For
the
most
part,
the
students
were
very
receptive
to
my
ideas
and
almost
all
showed
up
for
all
four
of
our
conferences.
Using
my
experiences
from
class
and
my
stint
as
a
WA
the
previous
year,
I
encouraged
the
students
to
come
up
with
their
own
interpretations
for
an
answer,
rather
than
simply
writing
the
obvious.
Many
of
them
had
trouble
integrating
both
the
primary
and
secondary
sources
into
their
papers.
They
simply
incorporated
quotations
without
really
acknowledging
them.
I
explained
to
these
students
that
quotes
are
only
to
be
used
if
they
are
relevant
to
the
thesis
and
can
be
commented
on
in
a
meaningful
way.
As
I
saw
more
finalized
drafts,
I
began
to
see
quotes
used
not
just
as
filler,
but
rather
as
a
means
by
which
a
student
could
reinforce
their
major
points.
I
may
have
been
the
one
with
Nexperience,O
but
I
learned
some
important
lessons
from
the
students
as
well.
I
often
told
students
that
there
was
more
than
one
answer
to
a
question,
yet
I
still
found
myself
having
an
ideal
paper
in
mind,
most
likely
because
I
asked
the
professor
for
examples
of
exceptional
writing
from
previous
years.
At
times
I
urged
my
students
to
go
in
a
certain
direction
with
their
thinking;
a
direction
that
reflected
some
of
the
more
exceptional
papers.
Yet
I
knew
that
this
contradicted
my
own
belief
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
one
ideal
answer.
This
troubled
me.
Once
I
realized
what
I
was
doing,
I
allowed
the
students
to
do
most
of
the
thinking
in
the
conference
and
worked
with
the
opinions
they
gave
me.
The
result
was
a
wide
array
of
unique,
but
no
less
compelling
papers.
I
wrote
about
this
in
my
summer
assignment
from
last
year,
and
it
is
an
issue
that
I
still
find
applicable
to
my
experience.
As
I
began
my
second
semester
of
my
third
year
at
Lafayette,
my
writing
was
less
focused
on
generating
original
thoughts.
I
had
begun
to
conquer
that
fear.
Now
I
concentrated
on
crafting
this
originality
in
a
way
that
was
organized
and
meaningful.
It
was
time
to
put
many
of
the
lessons
I
learned
in
my
first
semester
into
practice.
A
course
I
took
on
the
Victorians
novel
helped
me
accomplish
this.
Throughout
the
semester
we
wrote
weekly
2-page
papers
in
which
we
analyzed
any
features
of
interest
in
the
texts.
In
my
reading
of
Christina
RosettiOs
NGoblin
Market,O
I
began
to
notice
that
in
this
and
many
other
works
by
Rosetti
on
fallen
women,
there
is
a
profound
need
for
sisterhood
that
is
rarely
met.
I
began
to
look
for
patterns
in
the
poems
and
saw
that
they
all
had
many
interesting
things
in
common.
This
seemed
like
an
interesting
place
to
begin
brainstorming
for
my
final
12-page
paper.
I
had
rarely
written
anything
that
long
before
and
was
dreading
the
project
as
it
drew
nearer.
But
once
I
allowed
myself
to
be
creative
and
take
a
risk,
I
found
myself
enjoying
the
research
and
the
writing.
It
was
a
project
in
which
I
had
complete
creative
control.
Although
trying
at
times,
it
was
one
of
the
first
papers
in
which
I
could
feel
myself
developing
as
a
writer.
Because
I
was
making
a
truly
original
argument,
my
own
thoughts
were
able
to
flow
free
of
constrictions.
I
knew
I
had
created
something
I
could
really
be
proud
of.
Another
class
that
helped
me
to
develop
as
a
writer
was
an
Anthropology
&
Sociology
course
on
Race
&
Ethnic
Relations.
I
had
always
been
interested
in
the
subject,
so
I
decided
to
take
a
chance
and
sign
up
for
the
course.
However,
the
class
turned
out
to
be
much
more
than
a
class
on
race
relations.
For
a
200-level
course,
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
writing!
Every
few
weeks,
we
wrote
response
papers
on
anything
related
to
race
relations,
whether
it
was
a
discussion
of
an
issue
explored
in
class
or
one
from
everyday
life.
Once
in
a
while,
the
professor
would
ask
certain
students
to
share
their
thoughts
with
the
class
(provided
that
they
were
comfortable
with
this
and
the
professor
deemed
the
subject
appropriate.)
This
made
me
nervous.
I
had
experienced
workshops
before,
but
I
never
read
my
work
out
loud
to
an
audience
of
peers
before.
While
most
people
were
receptive
to
my
thoughts,
some
were
very
critical.
Yet
as
difficult
as
those
negative
comments
were
to
take,
I
feel
it
strengthened
my
thought
process
and
in
turn,
my
ability
to
communicate
these
thoughts
through
writing.
It
is
rare
that
one
can
have
his
or
her
writing
interpreted
by
many
very
different
eyes.
Yet
with
each
interpretation,
I
was
forced
to
examine
the
elements
of
my
writing
that
yielded
each
new
interpretation.
These
sessions
informed
me
of
just
how
crucial
language
is
in
communicating
a
meaning.
I
reviewed
my
tone,
the
constructions
of
my
verbs,
and
the
words
I
used
to
convey
my
feelings.
Each
had
its
own
unique
effect
on
how
my
writing
would
be
received
by
an
audience.
I
learned
to
be
more
careful
in
the
construction
of
my
own
writing.
But
most
of
all,
my
experience
in
the
course
taught
me
the
importance
of
listening.
More
often
than
not,
I
found
that
my
peers
had
wonderful
things
to
say
about
my
writing.
This
lesson
definitely
carried
over
into
my
conferences
as
a
second
semester
WA.
Although
some
students
may
think
of
a
Writing
Associate
as
somewhat
of
an
authoritative
position,
a
WA
is
much
more
of
a
peer
than
a
teacher.
Rather
than
fill
the
conferences
with
my
own
interpretations
and
suggestions
for
an
studentOs
paper,
I
began
my
conferences
by
asking
the
student
what
he
or
she
set
out
to
accomplish
in
the
paper,
as
well
as
what
were
the
requirements
of
the
assignment
as
the
student
understood
it.
More
often
than
not,
a
paper
that
veered
off
course
could
be
attributed
to
a
misinterpretation
of
the
assignmentOs
criteria.
By
simply
listening
to
the
student,
rather
than
imposing
my
own
opinions
of
where
he
or
she
went
wrong,
I
was
able
to
help
the
students
overcome
their
challenges.
Listening
encourages
a
natural
give
and
take
throughout
the
course
of
a
conference.
When
a
student
is
asked
how
he
or
she
feels
about
a
paper,
or
any
other
questions
for
that
matter,
they
feel
as
if
they
are
an
actual
participant
in
the
revision
of
the
paper,
rather
than
a
passive
recipient.
When
a
WA
and
a
student
are
able
to
bounce
ideas
off
of
each
other,
they
are
able
to
negotiate
an
oral
text,
which
can
help
the
student
in
the
revision
process.
I
believe
the
oral
text
is
just
as
important,
if
not
more,
than
the
written
text.
But
the
WA
must
initiate
this
process.
From
the
beginning,
the
WA
must
engage
the
student
and
allow
him
or
her
to
set
an
agenda
that
will
best
fit
his
or
her
needs.
If
an
agenda
is
not
set,
or
completely
set
by
the
WA,
it
is
more
likely
that
the
student
will
be
uninterested
and
therefore
unwilling
to
be
an
active
participant
in
the
conversation.
As
I
begin
my
final
year
at
Lafayette,
I
hope
to
gain
even
more
confidence
in
my
own
ability
as
a
Writing
Associate.
However,
I
intend
to
use
this
confidence
in
order
to
bring
my
students
out
of
their
shells;
not
as
a
means
by
which
I
can
show
off
my
own
knowledge.
I
intend
to
go
into
my
conferences,
not
with
an
ideal
paper
in
mind,
but
rather
with
an
open
mind
so
I
can
help
the
students
create
the
most
original
papers
they
are
capable
of.
I
will
encourage
both
freethinking
and
talking
by
the
students
throughout
the
conferences.
I
expect
that
I
will
do
most
of
the
listening,
only
speaking
up
in
order
to
ask
questions
or
point
the
students
in
a
direction
that
might
get
them
thinking
about
their
papers.
I
see
myself
being
more
of
a
resource,
rather
than
an
instructor.
By
the
end
of
my
conferences,
I
hope
that
the
students
will
leave
feeling
excited
about
the
task
at
hand
rather
than
worried.
I
suppose
the
most
valuable
advice
I
could
share
with
the
new
Writing
Associates
is
to
open
both
their
ears
and
their
minds.
It
is
very
easy
for
a
WA
to
sit
at
the
table
with
their
student
and
talk
at
them,
hoping
that
they
will
listen
and
take
some
of
this
advice
to
heart.
But
I
have
found
that
the
most
rewarding
conferences
are
those
in
which
the
students
begin
as
somewhat
resistant.
This
means
that
the
WA
must
work
even
harder
to
give
the
student
the
confidence
they
so
desperately
need.
And
this
often
occurs
through
listening
rather
than
talking.
Only
when
a
WA
opens
his
or
her
ears,
can
their
student
begin
to
open
his
or
her
mind.
