I
am
glad
to
say
that
my
history
as
a
writer
is
very
well
documented.
The
English
Department
in
the
school
district
I
attended
required
that
each
student
have
a
writing
folder.
This
distinctive
yellow
folder
with
green
writing
was
issued
to
me
in
Kindergarten
and
progressed
with
me
from
grade
to
grade
until
it
was
time
for
high
school
graduation.
I
often
look
at
the
work
contained
in
this
folder
and
notice
the
changes
in
my
writing
through
the
years.
These
changes
reflect
my
growth
as
a
person
as
well
as
a
student.
Looking
back
I
am
able
to
see
that
each
teacher
I
had
emphasized
a
different
aspect
of
writing
that
they
saw
as
important.
It
is
the
combination
of
all
these
skills
that
has
shaped
me
into
the
writer
that
I
am
today.
I
consider
my
first
meaningful
attempt
at
writing
to
be
when
I
was
in
second
grade.
The
focus
at
this
young
age
was
on
formulating
sentences
correctly
and
printing
letters
neatly.
With
practice
I
developed
these
basic
skills.
I
remember
that
I
would
do
my
writing
assignments
slowly,
but
with
great
care.
Looking
at
these
early
assignments
I
see
encouraging
comments
written
by
my
teacher
Miss
Celia.
In
the
coming
years,
receiving
positive
feedback
in
addition
to
constructive
criticism
encouraged
me
to
continue
writing
because
I
began
to
feel
that
it
was
something
that
I
could
do
fairly
well.
By
my
sixth
grade
year
I
had
gained
the
skills
to
be
able
to
express
myself
through
writing.
It
was
then
that
I
began
to
keep
a
personal
journal
of
many
of
my
thoughts
and
feelings.
At
first,
writing
things
that
were
very
personal
was
a
little
awkward
for
me.
I
was
initially
reluctant
to
write
journal
entries
for
fear
that
someone
would
find
my
journal
and
be
able
to
read
my
innermost
thoughts,
but
I
grew
more
comfortable
writing
and
that
concern
soon
diminished.
I
came
to
realize
that
writing
things
down
was
a
type
of
therapy.
If
I
was
confused
or
upset
about
how
I
felt
about
a
particular
situation,
I
would
write
down
my
thoughts
and
then
read
what
I
had
written.
By
reflecting
on
my
words
I
was
able
to
sort
things
out
for
myself.
I
believe
that
being
able
to
do
this
helped
me
get
through
some
difficult
times
in
the
years
ahead
of
me.
My
academic
writing
also
evolved
significantly
during
sixth
grade
because
of
my
English
teacher.
Miss
Belcastro
was
most
certainly
a
perfectionist.
She
emphasized
grammar
and
insisted
that
many
drafts
be
done
on
a
work
before
it
was
worthy
enough
to
be
considered
a
final
copy
.
This
was
often
very
frustrating
to
me
because
I
was
impatient
and
did
not
like
making
revision
after
revision
only
to
have
another
error
pointed
out.
Although
this
process
was
in
the
beginning
exasperating,
it
allowed
me
to
realize
the
importance
of
revising
and
proofreading
my
work.
I
also
learned
that
having
another
conscientious
classmate
read
my
writing
would
help
me
to
see
mistakes
that
I
would
have
never
noticed
on
my
own.
One
aspect
of
my
writing
that
was
always
perfect
in
Miss
Belcastro's
eyes
was
my
penmanship.
I
suppose
the
care
I
took
in
learning
how
to
form
each
letter
of
the
alphabet
in
elementary
school
had
paid
off.
She
gave
me
jobs
where
my
writing
was
on
display,
such
as
filling
out
class
charts
that
were
to
be
hung
up.
Since
then
I
have
always
been
proud
of
my
distinctive
handwriting.
I
came
to
the
conclusion
that
if
Miss
Belcastro
thought
it
was
beautiful
and
neat,
it
really
must
be.
Soon
after
this
I
bought
myself
a
calligraphy
pen
set;
I
experimented
writing
with
different
color
inks
and
various
size
pen
points.
My
hands
for
the
next
few
months
after
my
purchase
of
this
pen
seemed
to
be
permanently
stained
an
array
of
rainbow
colors.
Even
now
I
use
my
calligraphy
pen
when
writing
things
that
are
especially
important
or
significant
to
me.
In
eighth
grade
I
was
encouraged
to
write
in
a
different
matter
than
I
ever
had
in
the
past.
Creative
writing
assignments
were
given
more
frequently
during
this
school
year.
Students
were
expected
to
produce
such
things
as
short
stories
and
poetry.
Looking
back
on
some
of
the
short
stories
I
wrote,
I
can
see
that
they
are
quite
self-reflective.
I
would
develop
characters
that
had
many
of
the
same
qualities
I
believed
myself
to
have,
and
they
would
also
have
wants,
wishes,
and
goals
that
went
along
with
my
own.
At
the
time
I
did
not
clearly
recognize
that
I
was
reflecting
myself
in
my
work,
but
friends
who
would
read
my
short
stories
would
sometimes
notice
and
point
this
out
to
me.
I
can
see
that
this
was
a
creative
way
in
which
I
learned
I
could
express
myself.
Poetry
was
one
type
of
writing
that
was
difficult
for
me
at
first;
I
was
accustomed
to
creating
writing
that
was
more
concrete
than
I
believed
poetry
to
be.
I
remember
one
of
my
first
attempts
at
poetry
during
eighth
grade.
It
took
a
few
hours
to
compose
a
poem
that
in
the
end
was
only
five
short
stanzas
in
length.
Writing
this
piece
which
I
titled
Does
Anyone
Really
Know?,
became
an
emotional
experience
for
me.
The
words
I
wrote
were
carefully
chosen
and
came
from
my
heart.
Each
time
I
read
this
I
am
able
to
see
both
the
meaningfulness
and
deep
feeling
that
I
incorporated
into
the
poem.
Another
specific
type
of
poem
introduced
to
me
during
this
time
also
became
memorable.
The
assignment
given
was
very
specific:
to
write
a
poem
which
was
to
have
three
lines-five
syllables
in
the
first,
seven
in
the
second,
and
five
in
the
last.
It
was
explained
that
this
is
known
as
a
Haiku.
Haikus
came
to
me
more
easily
than
traditional
poetry,
and
writing
them
was
actually
fun
for
me.
There
are
still
a
few
that
I
am
able
to
recite
from
memory.
During
ninth
and
tenth
grade
I
was
introduced
to
a
great
deal
of
famous
literature
and
poetry.
Studying
and
learning
about
various
poets
and
poetry
movements
interested
me
a
great
deal.
As
a
result
of
this
exposure,
I
chose
to
write
papers
researching
the
life
and
works
of
such
poets
as
Amy
Lowell,
Sylvia
Plath,
and
Walt
Whitman.
Based
on
my
past
experiences
I
have
concluded
that
I
enjoy
studying
and
analyzing
the
poetry
of
others
rather
than
attempting
to
create
my
own.
I
anticipated
American
History
class
of
my
Junior
year
of
high
school
with
a
bit
of
trepidation.
It
was
the
first
Advanced
Placement
class
I
was
to
take,
a
class
in
which
I
would
be
able
to
earn
college
credits
if
I
did
well
on
an
exam
at
the
end
of
the
year.
Mr.
Harmanos,
the
teacher
of
this
class,
had
an
infamous
reputation.
I
and
the
other
brave
students
that
made
up
this
history
class
quickly
learned
what
was
expected
of
us.
Lots
of
reading
and
lots
of
writing,
a
good
indication
of
what
was
to
come
in
college.
We
were
expected
to
read
the
1000
page
history
book
during
the
course
of
the
school
year
and
were
also
given
weekly
essay
quizzes
on
the
information
we
read.
These
essays
were
not
to
simply
be
a
mindless
recitation
of
facts;
rather,
they
were
expected
to
be
well
organized
and
thoughtful.
They
had
to
have
a
thesis
at
the
beginning
that
would
touch
upon
all
of
the
points
we
planned
to
make
in
the
course
of
our
essay.
Each
paragraph
would
deal
with
one
idea
contained
in
the
thesis.
This
type
of
analytical
essay
writing
was
something
that
was
very
new
to
me
as
well
as
to
all
of
my
classmates.
For
the
first
time,
it
was
not
enough
to
simply
know
our
history.
We
had
to
present
it
in
an
organized
way
and
draw
intelligent
conclusions
based
on
the
information
we
knew.
After
a
few
weeks
of
frustration
I
began
to
catch
on
to
this
new
method
of
writing.
Learning
to
write
in
this
manner
gave
me
a
strong
foundation
in
the
type
of
writing
I
would
have
to
do
at
Lafayette
as
a
Government
and
Law
major.
Senior
year
I
took
another
Advanced
Placement
class
with
Mr.
Harmanos.
In
the
end
I
came
away
with
college
credits
for
the
classes
I
had
taken
and
more
importantly
an
invaluable
new
writing
method.
In
addition
to
the
aforementioned
assignments
of
writing
analytical
essays,
I
was
also
given
the
assignment
of
writing
an
in-depth
research
paper
during
twelfth
grade
that
was
to
be
a
year-long
project.
Each
student
was
given
the
choice
of
any
topic
which
interested
them.
I
choose
to
do
my
research
and
writing
on
the
issue
of
capital
punishment
because
of
my
interest
in
the
legal
system.
It
was
a
controversial
topic
that
I
was
entirely
objective
about
at
the
onset
of
my
research.
However,
during
the
process
of
gathering
information
and
compiling
my
research,
I
came
to
the
conclusion
that
I
was
strongly
opposed
to
the
death
penalty.
Just
like
writing
in
my
journal,
the
process
of
writing
a
research
paper
allowed
me
to
understand
and
sort
out
my
thoughts
and
beliefs.
I
enjoyed
writing
this
paper
and
felt
a
great
sense
of
satisfaction
when
it
was
completed.
My
research
paper,
entitled
The
Ultimate
Punishment,
was
the
last
official
entry
placed
into
my
writing
folder.
My
expectations
about
college
level
writing
have
been
fairly
accurate.
I
have
learned
that
each
professor
looks
for
different
things
in
the
writing
that
they
assign
and
that
it
is
important
to
pay
close
attention
to
the
assignment
that
is
given.
Although
I
anticipated
the
type
of
writing
I
would
have
to
do
at
the
college
level,
I
did
not
quite
realize
the
amount
of
writing
that
would
be
expected
of
me.
As
a
Government
and
Law
major
and
an
English
minor,
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
majority
of
my
grades
are
derived
from
either
papers
or
essay
exams.
The
most
challenging
type
of
writing
for
me
has
been
philosophical
papers.
I
have
found
that
these
papers
have
to
be
written
in
an
exceptionally
thoughtful
manner.
It
is
necessary
to
follow
a
very
particular
kind
of
logical
reasoning.
By
doing
this
type
of
writing
I
feel
that
my
writing
skills
are
challenged
and
as
a
result
are
able
to
develop
and
progress.
I
have
not
stopped
adding
to
my
writing
folder
which
contains
at
least
one
piece
of
work
each
year
since
Kindergarten.
This
summer
I
interned
at
our
county
courthouse
and
was
introduced
to
legal
writing.
The
manner
in
which
legal
documents
are
written
are
very
different
than
what
I
am
accustomed
to
dealing
with.
After
college
graduation
this
type
of
writing
will
become
familiar
to
me
if
I
go
on
to
pursue
my
interest
in
law.
Through
my
experience
thus
far,
I
have
come
to
the
realization
that
learning
to
write
is
a
forever
developing
progression.
