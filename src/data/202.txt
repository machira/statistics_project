Literacy
Narrative
Mhairi
August
23,
1999
I
read
a
lot
and
I
always
have.
What
amazes
me
about
books
is
that
there
are
so
many
writers
who
are
willing
to
bring
an
audience
of
strangers
into
their
imaginary
worlds.
In
my
writing,
I
have
wavered
between
a
public
writer
and
a
very
secretive
writer
the
likes
of
Emily
Dickinson.
I
have
also
wavered
between
being
a
prolific
writer
and
being
a
person
of
few
words.
Looking
over
the
development
of
my
writing
has
helped
me
to
see
writing
as
a
recursive
process.
My
writing
did
not
develop
along
a
straight
road;
it
developed
along
a
wining
and
treacherous
pathway.
I
have
seen
other
students
take
the
treacherous
path
as
well,
before
me,
with
me,
and
coming
up
behind
me
but
what
strikes
me
most
is
how
most
people's
experiences
manage
to
convince
them
that
they
are
poor
writers.
I
have
neither
scientific
data
nor
research
from
around
the
world,
but
the
largest
realization
that
I
have
come
to
in
thinking
about
my
writing
experiences
is
that
it
is
the
teacher's
and
the
editor's
responsibility
to
help
writers
become
successful.
I
know
I
started
writing
before
elementary
school.
My
mother
will
never
let
me
live
it
down.
She
tells
every
visitor
how
I
wrote
her
notes
and
slipped
them
under
the
bathroom
door
to
her.
Then,
though,
no
one
could
understand
the
scribbles
that
I
"wrote"
so
I
would
read
them
aloud,
recounting
long
tales
and
continuing
at
length.
As
a
child
writing
was
the
most
adult
thing
I
could
conceive
and
I
was
determined
to
be
an
adult,
to
make
myself
understood.
Writing
words
was
just
as
important
as
writing
sentences
and
I
would
fill
in
any
form
left
in
my
reach
by
scribbling
in
the
appropriate
places.
The
magic
of
reading,
which
I
adored,
was
quickly
converted
to
the
magic
of
writing.
At
five,
my
mother
will
tell
you
that
I
wrote
notes
to
my
parents
so
that
they
could
read
what
I
was
thinking
because
I
complained
of
having
to
spend
too
much
time
explaining
myself
to
them.
There
was
tremendous
power
in
making
myself
understood
without
talking.
I
was
a
prolific
writer
until
I
grew
self-conscious
about
sharing
my
writing.
Then,
writing
became
a
private
enterprise.
Once
I
could
write
legibly,
I
still
struggled
with
understanding.
At
first,
in
grade
school,
I
was
rewarded
for
writing
my
own
papers.
I
was
expected
to
write
for
myself
because
I
could.
I
did
not
enjoy
the
luxury
of
dictation
as
the
other
students
did
and
I
grew
accustomed
to
writing
on
my
own.
Writing
on
my
own,
though,
meant
writing
for
me.
I
did
not
want
to
share
my
writing
with
other
students
at
first
because
I
was
aware
that
it
was
better,
and
then
because
I
was
afraid
that
it
was
not
better.
I
would
sweat
at
moments
when
teachers
wanted
to
read
an
example
out
loud,
praying
that
the
selection
would
be
mind
but
also
that
it
would
not.
Even
then
I
was
aware
of
my
audience.
I
could
write
to
be
understood,
or
I
could
write
papers
whose
meaning
would
be
clear
only
to
me.
I
could
manipulate
the
teacher's
selection.
I
used
to
write
poetry,
because
adults
said
I
was
good
at
it.
My
parents
still
have
volumes
of
my
early
poetry
because
I
cannot
convince
them
to
throw
it
away.
I
was
encouraged
by
some
teachers,
but
wounded
by
others
who
accused
me
of
plagiarism
before
1
knew
what
plagiarism
was.
"You
did
not
write
this,"
they
told
me.
They
knew
I
copied
because
they
said
students
could
not
write
that
well.
However,
I
could
not
prove
that
I
had
not
copied
the
poems.
The
burden
of
proof
should
rest
on
the
teacher
but
my
elementary
school
teachers
bore
no
responsibility
to
their
students.
Unfounded
accusations
of
plagiarism
have
been
my
worst
writing
experiences.
I
felt
like
my
creativity
was
being
resented
and
destroyed.
My
early
poems
and
stories
had
almost
written
themselves
but
when
they
attacked
my
writing,
my
teachers
shattered
my
confidence
and
reinforced
that
being
too
creative
is
shameful.
I
was
unfortunate
enough
to
have
another
experience
with
plagiarism
as
an
adult.
During
my
senior
year
of
high
school
I
tutored
a
sixth
grade
girl
who
was
accused
of
plagiarism.
As
we
listened
to
her
teacher
yell
at
Emily,
I
couldn't
say
anything.
Emily
cried,
her
mother
was
outraged
into
silence,
and
I
backed
into
the
corner
understanding
what
Emily
felt
and
still
wanting
to
cry.
I
cannot
understand
why
writing
should
cease
to
be
fun,
but
that
is
what
the
educational
system
forces
upon
all
children.
After
being
accused
of
plagiarism,
I
was
too
scared
to
share
my
writing
with
teachers
lest
I
should
be
accused
again.
I
still
wrote
for
myself
but
1
destroyed
the
stories
when
1
was
done.
I
also
used
to
do
creative
writing
assignments
for
my
sister
but
1
hesitated
to
hand
them
in
myself.
Based
on
these
experiences,
it
seems
such
a
waste
to
me
that
a
love
for
writing
can
be
turned
on
and
off
by
comments
that
teachers
and
other
adults
make.
I
hate
when
students
say
that
their
writing
is
bad
or
not
good
enough
because
I
want
for
recognition
to
be
made
for
the
effort
that
is
made
as
well
as
for
a
story
that
is
well
crafted.
It
was
during
this
dry
spell
when
1
refused
to
write
that
I
had
teachers
who
paid
attention
to
technical
details.
I
was
interested
in
mechanics
and
happy
to
see
that
English
could
be
exacting.
1
loved
to
impose
rules
and
order
on
language.
I
diagrammed
sentences
and
diligently
recopied
whole
sentences
inserting
commas
in
the
appropriate
places.
No
one
liked
essay
tests
in
geography
-
except
me.
Finally,
we
had
rules
for
writing
these
exams
which
were
technical
and
exacting.
My
teacher,
Mr.
Hannan,
docked
five
points
per
occurrence
of
the
forbidden
words
(I,
me,
you,
very,
really,
much,
great,
and
so
on.)
From
this,
I
learned
to
write
quickly
and
to
think
while
I
was
writing.
I
manipulated
sentences
to
avoid
the
forbidden
words
on
my
exams.
Unfortunately,
once
I
had
received
this
rigorous
training
in
grammar
and
mechanics,
1
moved.
An
ordinary
move
might
not
deserve
mention
in
my
writing
history,
but
this
one
does.
I
moved
from
Europe
to
America.
Although
English
was
my
native
language,
1
marveled,
at
age
13,
that
American
English
could
be
so
different
from
my
"Standard
English."
My
sentences
were
"too
long"
and
"too
bumbling"
where
before
they
had
been
"too
short"
and
"too
plain
"
Suddenly,
1
spelled
poorly.
I
also
found
that
my
idioms,
imagery,
metaphors,
and
allusions
were
badly
received.
J
was
a
hesitant,
technical
writer
until
I
had
a
teacher
who
encouraged
free
writing
and
nap
time.
I
went
back
to
creative
writing.
In
language
arts,
we
were
expected
to
write
one
opinion
piece,
a
five
paragraph
essay
and
one
poem
per
quarter.
Once
those
goals
were
met,
everyone
wrote
independently
for
the
rest
of
the
term.
In
free
writing,
I
created
worlds
of
flowing
language
and
stories
that
may
not
have
led
anywhere,
but
they
were
new
worlds
that
were
to
be
all
mine
if
no
one
would
share
them.
No
one
would
share
my
free
writing.
Nonsensical
stories
were
not
as
amusing
as
they
had
been
when
I
was
four,
and
as
most
of
my
family
was
older,
they
already
believed
that
creative
writing
was
vapid
and
useless.
I
wrote
madly
because
I
had
friends
at
school
who
read
madly
and
in
my
class
we
shared
folders
and
kept
no
secrets.
By
the
end
of
the
year,
I
felt
I
had
developed
a
style
of
my
own
and
I
wrote
until
the
next
year
when
I
was
forced
to
rewrite
a
poem
for
exhibition
at
school.
I
was
not
asked
to
re-work
the
poem,
but
forced
to
recopy
my
teacher's
suggestions.
My
mother
did
not
understand
my
objection;
she
thought
I
should
do
what
the
teacher
asked
and
be
done
with
it
and
why
was
I
always
getting
into
trouble
at
school?
I
know
I
am
not
e.e.
cummings,
but
I
told
my
teacher
that
1
did
not
intend
to
exhibit
her
writing
under
my
name,
and
for
the
balance
of
the
year,
I
refused
to
give
her
more
than
was
required
of
me.
In
high
school
classes
1
was
never
offered
the
opportunity
to
hand
in
creative
writing.
When
I
started
writing
poems
again,
I
did
it
for
me.
I
would
not
share
my
writing
with
many
people
and
rarely
let
on
that
I
wrote
anything
outside
of
class.
Those
people
with
whom
I
did
share
my
poems
were
surprised.
Creative
writing
had
become
something
almost
shameful;
it
had
given
way
to
the
almighty
essay.
It
was
only
under
condition
of
anonymity
that
I
allowed
a
poem
of
mine
to
be
published
in
my
high
school
literary
magazine.
When
I
moved
to
America,
seven
years
ago,
I
was
introduced
to
the
infamous
district
writing
sample
and
the
five-paragraph
essay.
The
hardest
part
of
a
writing
sample
was
sticking
to
the
formula,
and
limiting
my
opinion
to
five
paragraphs.
Where
I
live,
a
five-paragraph
essay
is
a
very
serious
affair
and
many
teachers
enforced
that
all
decent
five-paragraph
essays
were
of
five
paragraphs
in
length.
I
fought
with
teachers
over
the
length
of
essays.
I
did
not
finish
my
papers
until
I
had
finished
what
I
wanted
to
say.
When
I
was
old
enough
to
deserve
an
explanation,
I
was
told
that
students
need
to
start
with
a
rigid
model
and
they
will
learn
to
branch
out
from
there.
Sadly,
I
found
that
after
three
years
1
learned
to
be
abrupt.
I
became
submissive
to
my
English
teachers
and
I
saved
my
more
eloquent
work
for
papers
in
history
class
because
they
were
less
regimented.
I
could
research
and
pull
together
ideas
from
multiple
sources.
I
could
write
papers
that
were
twelve
paragraphs
long
and
that
was
a
novelty.
Enforced
restrictions
on
writing
were
a
general
trend
throughout
my
schooling
in
America,
and
a
great
point
of
resentment
against
my
English
teachers.
In
my
senior
year
of
high
school,
I
was
asked
to
keep
a
journal
and
write
one
page
a
day.
I
returned
to
creative
writing
because
no
one
threatened
to
read
my
journal.
I
grew
to
trust
my
teacher,
and
allowed
him
to
read
some
of
the
entries,
instead
of
writing
many
essays,
that
year
the
focus
of
the
class
was
to
develop
reading
and
analysis
skills.
We
discussed
theses
and
conclusions
about
the
books
we
read.
Each
person
in
our
class
would
have
five
minutes
to
"speak"
an
essay
to
the
class
instead
of
timed
writing.
I
found
that
this
helped
me
to
organize
my
thoughts
although
at
the
time
I
feared
that
1
would
forget
how
to
write.
I
did
not
write
any
graded
essays
that
year,
but
the
time
spent
preparing
for
the
AP
exam
by
discussing
format,
reading
and
analyzing
enabled
me
to
apply
those
skills
to
my
style
and
my
writing.
I
felt
I
learned
more
by
outlining
my
thoughts,
developing
and
editing
papers
than
I
had
by
writing
papers
for
years
before
that.
The
quality
of
my
writing
grew
immensely
from
reading
and
discussing
literature.
Beginning
my
freshman
year
in
college,
1
felt
that
1
had
my
writing
under
control.
Now,
I
realize
that
my
writing
has
changed
a
great
deal
over
the
past
year.
I
have
experienced
two
writing
courses
that
challenged
everything
I
had
written
before
and
I
watched
my
writing
take
leaps
and
bounds
as
well
as
undergo
some
fine-tuning.
One
of
these
pivotal
classes
was
in
French.
I
had
never
written
anything
substantial
in
French
before
although
I
had
mechanics
and
vocabulary.
I
was
not
sure
if
writing
in
French
would
be
a
similar
experience
to
writing
in
English
or
a
different
experience.
1
had
to
think
in
French
to
write
the
papers
and
although
I
did
poorly,
I
am
glad
I
had
the
opportunity
to
try.
I
have
expressed
thoughts
that
do
not
make
sense
to
me
in
English.
Somehow,
those
papers
make
sense
in
French
but
English
translations
lack
substance.
I
found
it
eerie
to
watch
thoughts
and
phrases
come
together
in
a
foreign
language.
I
remembered
from
when
I
was
younger,
that
my
poems
and
stories
seemed
to
write
themselves.
I
had
the
basic
building
blocks
of
language,
and
practice
from
my
English
writing
experiences,
and
somehow
that
became
a
skill
for
writing
and
explaining
myself
that
was
innate.
I
was
writing
in
French!
The
second
semester
of
my
freshman
year,
I
was
forced
to
apply
the
differences
between
technical
writing
and
literature
in
Engineering
Ethics.
The
separation
became
more
distinct
to
me
and
I
found
that,
like
my
English
writing
and
French
writing
experiences,
establishing
the
appropriate
tone
and
style
was
merely
a
question
of
setting
myself
on
the
subject
and
my
mental
frame
during
writing.
I
am
like
a
general
who
watches
her
thoughts
come
together
to
make
a
grand
army
of
words.
I
have
come
to
appreciate
these
writing
challenges
although
I
did
not
at
the
time.
I
do
not
feel
that
there
is
so
much
of
a
distinction
between
different
types
of
writing
as
I
thought
before.
Now
I
have
more
confidence
that
I
will
be
able
to
produce
work
that
is
correct
and
appropriate
in
any
circumstance.
At
the
very
least,
I
will
be
able
to
adapt
myself
once
again
to
develop
another
writing
style.
Over
all
of
my
writing
experiences,
a
few
glaring
issues
stand
out
to
me.
One
issue
is
the
distinction
that
I
was
taught
between
fiction
and
non-fiction.
In
elementary
school,
everyone
wrote
fiction,
poetry
and
short
stories.
We
read
equally
fiction
and
non
fiction.
However,
it
was
my
experience
that
in
high
school,
we
read
only
fiction
(textbooks
do
not
count)
and
wrote
only
non-fiction.
This
generalization
developed
in
the
minds
of
my
classmates
and
myself
the
view
that
writing
fiction
was
wasteful.
I
see
that
this
view
stubbornly
persists
in
my
current
attitude
and
I
notice
that
I
have
not
written
in
my
journal
for
a
long
time.
For
the
last
two
years,
1
can
only
remember
writing
academic
papers.
I
would
like
to
blame
my
lack
of
confidence
as
a
writer
on
adults
who
taught
me
that
academic
writing
is
worthier
than
free
writing.
Even
now,
while
I
can
share
my
academic
writing
with
others,
I
keep
everything
else
private.
Another
issue
is
a
question
of
standardization.
Writing
is
an
individual
affair,
it
is
learning
to
express
and
develop
thoughts
on
paper.
Preventing
expression,
or
disallowing
students
the
tools
they
need
to
express
themselves
is
mere
cruelty.
When
we
are
little,
our
teachers
and
our
parents
see
a
spark
of
genius
in
everything
we
do
and
everything
we
write,
but
when
we
reach
high
school,
there
is
an
effort
to
standardize
everyone.
Standardized
essays
and
exams
make
the
adults
who
call
themselves
teachers
responsible
for
repressing
students
and
students
just
can't
see
the
spark
anymore.
But
it
is
still
there.
I
still
have
the
urge
to
write
a
book
after
all
this.
Every
time
I
write
an
essay,
I
realize
that
I
have
so
much
more
to
say,
no
story
ever
ends
and
1
am
never
satisfied.
However,
I
fear
that
when,
as
an
old
woman,
1
get
up
the
nerve
to
publish,
I
will
meekly
offer
up
some
facts
that
I
found
in
the
dark
recesses
of
a
library
because
1
can
no
longer
reach
the
dark
recesses
of
my
imagination.
