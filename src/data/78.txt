My
History
as
a
Writer
My
earliest
memories
about
writing
are
few.
I
remember
being
three-
or
four-years-old
in
the
kitchen
with
my
mother,
connecting
the
pattern
of
dots
she
created
and
writing
my
name.
I
remember
CLIP
,
an
early
afternoon
writing
ritual
at
St.
Elizabeth
Ann
Seton
grammar
school.
Immediately
after
recess,
we'd
open
our
black-and-white
marble
composition
notebooks
and
write
a
page
on
the
topic
provided
by
the
teacher
(usually
something
like
my
favorite...
,
what
I
think
of
x
or
what
y
means
to
me
)
.
I
remember
the
Palmer
penmanship
workbooks
Sister
Regina
Catherine
relied
on
to
teach
us
as
fourth
graders
how
to
turn
our
print
into
script,
or
cursive.
Throughout
my
eight
years
of
grammar
school,
I
remember
numerous
compositions,
book
reports,
science
projects
and
social
studies
papers,
but
I
do
not
clearly
remember
what
I
wrote
about.
The
writing
interested
me
very
little,
if
at
all.
I
was
a
shy
child,
both
easy
and
eager
to
please;
I
was
a
good
student.
While
some
of
my
classmates
formed
attachments
to
writing
at
an
early
age
(Carolyn
and
Heather
both
decided
by
the
sixth
grade
that
they
would
be
novelists
when
they
grew
up),
writing
was
just
something
I
did
because
the
teacher
asked
me
to.
I
put
as
much
of
myself
into
my
writing
as
I
did
into
a
math
problem
or
a
geography
lesson.
I
spent
the
four
years
following
grammar
school
at
the
Academy
of
Our
Lady
of
Good
Counsel.
There
I
experimented
for
the
first
time
with
creative
writing.
Sophomore
year
my
best
friend,
Alyson,
and
I
giggled
over
silly
poetry
we
dedicated
to
various
figures
in
our
lives.
We
amused
ourselves
and
our
friends
for
weeks
with
odes
to
dozens
of
people
including
Jason
(her
first
boyfriend),
Carlos
(my
first
crush),
Sister
Fran
(our
hearing-impaired
music
teacher)
and
Mrs.
Lyons
(our
gym
teacher
turned
Dean
of
Students).
By
junior
year
of
high
school,
I
was
keeping
a
personal
journal
semi-regularly.
I
wrote
about
your
typical
teenage
girl
problems,
sharing
romantic
troubles
and
rarer
moments
of
happiness.
What
I
liked
about
my
journal
was
how
it
put
everything
in
perspective.
When
I
wrote
about
what
was
on
my
mind
and
going
on
in
my
life,
everything
would
fall
into
place.
The
bad
things
didn't
seem
as
bad,
and
the
good
things
seemed
that
much
better.
The
writing
I
did
for
high
school
classes
was,
similar
to
the
work
I
produced
in
grammar
school,
perfunctory.
I
was
still
a
good
student
and
still
eager
to
please,
completing
assignments
for
my
teacher's
approval.
It
follows,
then,
that
while
the
work
I
handed
in
was
good
enough
for
a
good
grade,
I
got
little
else
out
of
my
writing
experiences.
In
focusing
too
much
on
what
my
teacher
would
like
to
read,
I
often
neglected
to
fully
develop
my
own
thoughts
and
ideas.
Overall,
my
writing
experiences
throughout
grammar
and
high
schools
were
significantly
less
than
rewarding.
And
yet
now
I
find
myself,
as
a
senior
in
college
and
a
candidate
for
a
Bachelor
of
Arts
degree
in
English,
contemplating
a
career
involving
writing.
Clearly
my
feelings
toward
writing
have
changed
dramatically
within
the
past
four
years;
it
is
this
most
recent
history
that
I
feel
has
most
fully
developed
my
writing
ability.
As
a
freshman
at
Lafayette
College,
I
soon
found
that,
just
as
I
had
expected,
there
was
little
in
the
nature
of
college
level
writing
distinguishing
it
from
its
high
school
equivalent.
I
did
notice,
however,
a
difference
in
the
attitudes
of
my
fellow
writers.
Classmates
took
our
assignments
much
more
seriously
than
any
of
my
friends
(and
I
must
include
myself)
had
in
high
school.
It
seemed
to
me
that
these
students
cared
about
the
quality
of
their
work
first
and
foremost;
grades
were
secondary.
Interaction
with
my
First
Year
Seminar
classmates
taught
me
to
approach
and
appreciate
writing
as
a
valuable
channel
through
which
to
communicate
the
intelligent
ideas
dancing
around
in
my
head.
I
remember
when
I
wrote
the
first
paper
I
was
really
proud
of;
it
was
sophomore
year
in
college.
My
introductory
level
government
course
instructor
allowed
us
the
option
of
a
ten-page
paper
in
lieu
of
a
third
exam.
I
decided
to
put
my
newly
declared
writing
skills
(for
I
was
now
an
officially
declared
English
major)
to
work;
I
devoted
much
time
and
careful
attention
to
the
creation
of
a
well-written
analysis
of
the
barge
tax.
Several
weeks
later
when
the
professor
returned
the
graded
papers
in
class,
I
was
empty-handed.
Although
he
searched
everywhere
--
his
office,
his
car,
his
home,
his
briefcase
--
my
perfect
little
piece
of
prose
could
not
be
found.
To
compensate
for
his
failure
to
keep
track
of
my
paper,
he
gave
me
an
A.
I
was
so
disappointed.
It
wasn't
the
grade
for
but
rather
his
reaction
to
my
work
that
I
cared
about.
This
wasn't
high
school
anymore;
I
was
not
writing
for
an
A
or
to
please
him.
I
wrote
a
paper
that
pleased
me,
and
I
wanted
feedback
from
an
intelligent,
well-informed
and
experienced
reader.
Notwithstanding
that
the
A
did
help
my
final
grade
for
the
course,
I
still
felt
cheated.
In
the
spring
of
junior
year,
I
wrote
a
paper
that
I
was
not
proud
of.
It
was
fair,
but
not
good,
and
I
knew
it.
I
was
not
surprised
then
by
the
grade
I
received
but
rather
by
my
professor's
reaction
to
my
reaction.
I
approached
her
after
class
to
see
if
we
might
sit
down
and
discuss
what
she
thought
about
my
paper
and
where
it
had
gone
wrong.
Her
written
comments
led
me
to
believe
my
paper
had
not
lived
up
to
her
expectations;
I
wanted
to
know
more
about
what
she
saw
in
my
paper
and
not
what
she
didn't.
After
listening
to
me
explain
as
much,
and
with
a
brief
glance
at
my
work,
the
professor
reached
over
and
silently
changed
the
-
to
a
+.
That
was
not
what
I
wanted
from
her.
True,
I
was
not
happy
with
my
grade,
but
I
was
more
concerned
with
how
and
why
I
received
it.
It
angered
me
that
my
teacher
didn't
take
me
seriously
as
a
writer.
On
a
much
more
positive
note,
also
in
the
spring
of
junior
year,
I
participated
in
the
ultimate
writing
experience.
I
met
twice
weekly
as
part
of
an
intimate
group
of
highly
motivated
students
under
the
guidance
of
a
most
dedicated
professor
to
work
at
becoming
a
better
writer.
We
helped
one
another
create
and
understand
enthymemes.
We
were
there
for
one
another
when
the
great
bathtub
hoax
rocked
our
world.
We
reviewed
each
other's
drafts
honestly
and
constructively.
And
at
the
end
of
the
semester
when
our
argumentative
essays
were
put
to
rest,
on
a
whole
we
had
achieved
our
goal.
We
were
writers
much
improved.
From
this
experience,
I
learned
that
you
get
out
of
writing
as
much
as
you
put
into
it.
Becoming
a
better
writer
doesn't
just
happen,
but
it
can
happen
with
motivation,
dedication
and,
of
course,
practice,
practice,
practice.
It's
the
best
feeling
to
hand
in
your
work
to
a
professor
and
know
that
it
is
well-written.
I'm
glad
I
found
this
out
early
in
my
college
career;
while
some
may
discover
this
while
still
in
high
school,
I
am
sure
that
there
are
other
students
who
have
yet
to
write
for
anything
but
a
good
grade.
Don't
misunderstand
me
--grades
still
matter.
But
now,
if
I
want
an
A
it
is
because
I
feel
I
deserve
it
for
the
quality
of
my
paper
and
not
because
I
have
written
exactly
what
my
professor
would
like
to
read.
