Writing
Associate
Project
for
Fall
1996
Workshop:
Writing
like
a
WA--Yolanda
When
I
examine
the
progression
of
my
writing,
I
view
the
process
as
one
similar
to
looking
into
a
mirror
or
tear-staining
the
leather
couch
in
a
psychiatrist's
office.
For
me,
the
process
of
writing
is
intricately
entwined
with
living.
Writing(and
not
writing)
affects
how
high
the
tide
of
emotions
is,
how
I
feel
from
day
to
day,
and
how
I
adjust
to
different
environments.
Writing
over
the
course
of
the
9-10
years
that
I
have
been
experimenting
with
words,
styles,
and
sounds
has
become
as
much
a
part
of
me
as
the
Gap
clothes
I
love
to
wear,
the
De
La
Soul
and
Tracy
Chapman
tracks
I
groove
to,
and
the
curly
cropped
natural
on
my
head.
I
hate
it
when
1
hear
someone
say,
"Poetry
is
stupid."
Taking
writing
lightly
is
something
I
have
never
been
able
to
do.
I
remember
reading
an
Alice
Walker
essay
in
which
she
proclaimed
that
if
she
could
not
write,
she
would
not
survive.
I
was
very
afraid
of
that
statement-how
much
desperation
and
dependence
lay
behind
it.
How
could
anyone,
I
thought
then,
base
her
life
around
words
and
phrases,
metaphors
and
similes,
and
sometimes
made-up
expressions?
As
I
became
a
more
mature
writer
and
started
to
compose
poems
that
brought
me
peace,
that
moved
me
to
anger
and
action,
and
made
me
weep
at
the
power
of
my
emotions,
I
understood
more
dearly
Walker's
statement.
Writing,
if
you
are
dedicated,
is
something
that
you
live
with.
For
instance,
when
I
don't
write,
I
feel
as
though
I
am
not
giving
anything
for
all
that
I
am
taking.
When
I
walk
the
streets
of
Philadelphia,
laughing
it
up
with
my
friends,
wearing
bright
colored
clothes
that
give
me
warm
feelings,
I
let
my
senses
gobble
up
the
world.
I
admit,
the
act
of
"taking
life"
around
me
is
a
greedy
one.
I
see
potholes,
homeless
folks,
young
gangsters,
pregnant
babies,
and
beautiful
children--they
all
make
me
feel
something.
Sometimes,
1
find
myself
in
phases
during
which
I
go
to
plays
that
get
me
thinking,
go
to
concerts
that
get
my
blood
rushing,
hear
philosophy
sneak
out
of
the
television
set,
and
I
soak
it
up.
But
for
some
reason,
1
can't
write
about
it.
1
get
a
mental
block
trying
to
find
just
the
right
words
and
sounds
to
express
how
something
made
me
feel.
And
if
I
can't
1
don't
feel
like
I'm
giving
back
anything
that
I
am
taking.
Over
the
past
year,
writing
for
me
has
become
less
a
personal
and
therapeutic
act
and
more
a
part
of
my
plan
of
action
to
mobilize
people
and
get
things
done.
By
working
on
Aya,
a
Lafayette
publication
which
speaks
to
and
for
students
of
color,
this
has
become
more
apparent
to
me.
I
have
always
loved
the
strength
and
power
that
writing
poems
gives
me,
but
over
the
course
of
the
year,
I
started
using
my
more
general
and
non-fictional
skills
to
write
articles
about
issues,
about
things
that
were
going
on
in
the
world,
about
people
who
were
taking
action.
When
I
finished
writing
articles
for
the
public
information
office
or
writing
an
article
for
Aya
the
personal
gratification
I
felt
was
unbelievable*
This
time,
I
felt
as
though
I
taken
in,
just
like
I
had
done
during
my
rendezvous
in
the
city,
but
had
given
back--
more.
As
a
writing
associate
last
fall,
I
always
told
people
how
much
helping
first-year
students
with
their
papers
had
improved
my
writing.
I
discussed
with
other
students
and
other
writing
associates
how
my
revision
skills
had
been
enhanced,
how
more
coherent
and
organized
my
papers
were,
and
how
much
more
focused
my
theses
and
ideas
seemed.
I
didn't
dwell
long
on
the
thought
of
actually
changing
people's
perceptions
of
writing
and
helping
students
to
vastly
improve
their
writing
skills.
1
thought
that
was
impossible
as
destroying
racism
or
reforming
welfare.
The
writing
climate
at
Lafayette
wasn't
that
favorable:
students
didn't
seem
to
care
a
great
deal
about
writing
and
much
less
worried
about
improving
their
own.
How
could
I,
just
a
student
myself,
help
prepare
first-year
students
for
college-level
writing?
I
learned
that
with
a
little
effort
and
commitment
I
could
change
a
lot.
The
semester
I
worked
as
a
WA
with
a
Jazz
Issues
class
was
one
of
the
most
eye-opening
writing
experiences
I
have
ever
had-
Of
course,
after
the
first
or
second
conference
with
my
students,
I
didn't
really
notice
a
difference/improvement
in
their
papers.
But
after
that,
I
gradually
came
to
see
how
offering;
my
point-of-view
on
their
papers
and
talking
to
them
as
one
writer
to
another,
helped
them
to
evaluate
and
revise
their
work
more
effectively.
One
of
my
success
stories
was
Ginger1,
a
friendly
and
hesitant
first-year
student
who
had
little
confidence
in
her
writing
ability*
I
found
after
reading
Ginger's
first
paper,
that
h.<<?r
main
problem
was
organization.
Sentences
seemed
out
of
place,
creating
paragraphs
with
no
real
topic
sentence
or
main
idea.
I
didn't
think
showing
Ginger
copies
of
organized
paragraphs
or
just
trying
to
explain
coherence
to
her
would
do
any
good,
so
I
used
some
ingenuity
and
creativity
to
apply
an
experience
I
had
In
the
tenth
grade
in
a
short
story
workshop
at
the
University
of
the
Arts
in
Philadelphia.
The
first
day
of
class,
the
teacher
instructed
us
to
write
a
short
story
on
anything
that
we
liked.
When
the
class
came
in
the
next
day
to
discuss
our
stories,
most

particular
reason,
but

it
seemed
like
the
right
thing
to
do!
people
expressed
concern
with
their
lack
of
organization
or
focus.
The
teacher
gave
us
each
a
pair
of
scissors
and
told
ns
to
cut
our
stories
into
paragraphs
and
sentences.
With
the
jagged
pieces
of
stories
spread
across
our
desks,
we
maneuvered
sentences
and
paragraphs,
and
even
words,
to
create
more
coherent
and
sometimes
different
stories
than
we
had
started
out
with.
It
really
helped
me
to
gain
an
appreciation
for
writing
as
an
art:
it
was
almost
like
making
a
collage.
I
used
this
technique
with
Ginger
during
our
third
conference
and
although
it
took
us
a
while
to
cut
up
pieces
and
gPShie
them
together*
we
shared
a
lot
of
laughs
and
jokes
during
the
process.
Ginger
left
the
conference
and
went
hack
to
her
room,
and
during
the
weekend,
she
cut
up
her
whole
paper
and
rearranged
it.
She
brought
it
back
to
me
that
Sunday
and
I
couldn't
believe
how
much
better
it
was.
It
was
a
100%
better
than
her
first
draft,
and
she
got
a
better
grade
on
it
than
on
her
previous
paper
for
the
class.
More
importantly,
she
had
fun
with
the
writing
process
which
is
all
I
can
really
say
I
could
ask
from
my
students,
more
so
than
A+
papers
and
corrected
spelling
and
grammar
errors.
Ginger
didn't
use
the
cut
and
paste
technique
for
all
her
papers
after
that,
but
it
did
make
her
more
conscious
of
her
organization
and
less
doubtful
about
her
writing
abilities*
I
felt
the
same
satisfaction
as
I
had
felt
writing
for
Aya
or
the
Public
Info
Office
when
Ginger
hugged
me
at
the
last
conference
and
told
me
how
much
of
a
better
writer
she
had
become
and
how
much
she
greatly
appreciated
my
help*
The
WA
experience
ceased
to
find
me
on
just
the
receiving
end
of
benefits.
Although
there
were
students
in
my
class
that
didn't
attend
conferences
and
did
not
improve
with
each
paper,
I
fed
off
of
helping
willing
students
to
see
all
the
possibilities
for
expressing
ideas
that
writing
offered.
I
loved
to
show
them
how
many
different
ways
a
word
could
be
used,
or
how
many
different
ways
a
paper
could
be
organized.
I
wanted
to
instill
in
them
the
love
for
writing
that
I
felt.
Now,
of
course,
not
everyone
finished
the
class
feeling
the
fire
and
passion
of
writing,
but
at
least
some
could
no
longer
say,
"I'm
just
not
the
writing
type,"
or
"I've
never
been
a
good
writer,"
or
even
worse,
"Writing
is
stupid."
Giving
back
through
writing
has
become
more
a
part
of
my
personal
mission
than
I
thought
it
would.
It
seems
as
if
everything
I
write
incorporates
some
element
of
giving
back.
Pve
taken
risks
to
impart
what
I
feel,
no
matter
how
opinionated
or
bold,
to
readers.
This
is
my
way
of
opening
up
and
communicating.
I
think
about
how
readers
will
perceive
my
views,
what
kind
of
voice
I
am
exuding.
I
constantly
ask
my
boyfriend,
who
is
also
a
writer,
what
kind
of
person
he
would
think
I
was
if
he
didn't
know
me,
and
read
a
particular
poem
of
mine.
I
like
to
know
how
my
words
are
making
people
feel
and
what
they
are
making
people
think
about.
Writing
is
also
a
personal
act
of
giving,
as
it
will
always
be.
every
time
1
sit
down
and
write,
1
feel
like
I
am
giving
nourishment
to
my
soul
and
the
creativity
that
does
not
often
get
nursed
amidst
school
work
and
summer
internship
obligations.
When
1
write
a
poem
that
really
delves
into
the
past
or
celebrates
relatives
and
loved
ones,
I
feel
as
though
I
am
paying
homage
to
my
ancestors.
When
I
write
a
poem
in
my
journal
that
no
one
sees
except
for
me
when
I'm
looking
for
a
blank
page
to
house
a
new
thought,
I
especially
feel
as
if
I
am
giving
back
to
the
little
girl,
the
teenager,
the
young
and
the
old
woman
inside
me
who
know
that
writing
is
their
means
of
combating,
exploring,
and
changing
the
world.
