Literacy
Narrative
Project
for
2006
Workshop
I
never
thought
I
could
call
myself
a
writer.
As
a
child,
I
was
certainly
bursting
with
creativity
and
wild
ideas
as
any
child
is,
but
bringing
me
to
sit
and
listen
to
a
story,
let
alone
spend
time
writing
one
down,
was
a
feat
fit
only
for
champions.
However,
it
amazes
me
what
a
long
way
a
little
encouragement
and
experience
can
take
a
person,
since
I
am
now
preparing
myself
to
be
a
type
of
mentor
on
the
subject.
To
coin
my
fatherOs
favorite
phrase,
whoOd
have
thought
it?
As
far
as
my
memory
and
I
are
concerned,
my
true
writing
history
did
not
begin
until
the
arrival
of
one
routine,
unsuspecting
afternoon
early
in
my
first
grade
of
school.
I
had
been
working
on
a
routine
writing
assignment:
filling
notebook
lines
with
single
letters
of
the
alphabet
until
said
letters
lost
all
meaning.
My
mother
dutifully
oversaw
my
work
from
her
seat
at
the
kitchen
table,
offering
encouragement
as
I
carefully
formed
the
letter
Nh.O
Then,
by
some
twist
of
fate,
wrist,
and
pencil,
it
happened.
My
gasped,
proclaiming
that
I
had
produced
the
most
flawless
letter
NhO
she
had
ever
seen.
The
expression
in
its
playful
curve
contrasted
with
the
precise
and
perfectly
proportional
staff
was
a
work
of
art!
Sister
was
called
over
to
be
a
witness,
and
she
agreed:
how
marvelous!
It
should
be
saved!
Documented!
Put
on
display!
In
those
moments,
all
my
transgressions
of
backwards
and
improperly
formed
letters
were
forgiven
as
the
entire
family
marveled
at
the
phenomenon.
I
was
elated.
My
letter
and
I
could
have
part
the
Red
Seas.
As
a
kid,
I
looked
back
fondly
on
that
day
as
one
of
grand
accomplishment.
Now,
my
fondness
of
that
day
grows
from
what
caused
that
feeling
in
the
first
place:
encouragement.
Encouragement
was
one
of
the
most
consistent
and
invaluable
components
of
my
years
in
school.
The
encouragement
I
received
that
day
turned
on
a
light
somewhere
inside
me.
The
thought
of
having
touched
upon
something
exciting
that
day,
trivial
though
it
may
have
been,
was
enough
to
in
turn
excite
me
about
writing.
While
in
elementary
school,
my
fellow
students
and
I
were
encouraged
to
write
as
much
as
possible.
Looking
for
more
opportunity
to
earn
the
positive
reinforcement
I
loved
receiving
from
my
family,
I
embarked
on
the
overachieverOs
path
immediately.
I
took
direction
to
be
thorough
and
creative
very
seriously,
making
sure
that
everything
I
wrote
was
well
thought-out
and
unique.
One
would
have
thought
I
was
turning
the
construction
of
vocabulary
word
sentences
into
an
Olympic
sportNwhich,
at
the
time,
was
commended
by
my
teachers.
These
teachers
gave
me
plenty
of
freedom
to
be
as
unique
as
possible
in
various
forms
of
writing.
I
recall
a
fairly
in-depth
exploration
with
poetry
and
essay
formats,
reading
and
writing
in
every
style
from
free
verse
and
sonnets
to
descriptive
essays
and
Nfive
senses
writing.O
My
teachersO
methods
were
extremely
conducive
to
stimulating
my
creativity
and
confidence
about
my
writing;
each
new
writing
device
and
NloadedO
word
encountered
represented
a
grand
discovery,
a
new
tool
at
my
disposal.
My
fifth
grade
teacher
in
particular
stood
out
in
this
respect,
delivering
unflagging
encouragement
and
enthusiasm
for
her
class.
Looking
back,
I
recognize
that
by
doing
this,
she
also
encouraged
a
lack
of
self-consciousness
in
my
own
writing.
To
me,
nothing
was
too
silly
or
too
outlandish
to
write
aboutNand
I
still
have
my
narrative
about
James
BondOs
rodent
life
coach
as
proof.
However,
after
moving
to
a
new
state
and
school
in
seventh
grade,
my
comfort
with
writing
dwindled
some.
Due
to
a
curriculum
discrepancy
from
school
to
school,
I
found
myself
behind
on
the
grammar
and
writing
track.
For
the
first
time
in
my
academic
career,
I
struggled
to
keep
up
with
the
class;
which
was,
to
me,
a
nightmare.
At
the
same
time,
my
older
sister
was
coming
into
her
own
as
a
writer,
constantly
receiving
praise
for
her
high
school
writing
endeavors.
Observing
these
trends,
my
parents
dubbed
me
Nthe
quantO
and
my
sister
Nthe
writer.O
Though
I
never
actually
performed
poorly
and
my
teachers
reassured
me
of
my
writing
capabilities,
these
events
brought
me
to
view
English
and
writing
as
a
weakness.
In
an
attempt
to
nip
this
weakness
in
the
bud,
I
became
even
more
meticulous.
I
turned
the
task
of
writing
an
essayOs
opening
paragraph
into
labor.
I
would
begin
writing,
cross
out,
and
rewrite
so
many
times
that,
by
the
time
I
was
satisfied,
merely
fragments
of
accepted
lines
were
discernable
on
each
page.
Being
unique
was
no
longer
a
joy
but
a
necessity
in
order
for
me
to
stand
out,
both
as
writer
and
new
student.
Ironically,
this
brought
me
to
miss
the
forest
for
the
trees,
giving
my
writing
a
choppy,
awkward
tendency.
Fortunately,
this
period
didnOt
last
long.
I
learned
to
use
my
self-consciousness
in
a
more
helpful
way
when
my
8th
grade
curriculum
emphasized
revision.
With
multiple
drafts,
all
was
not
lost
with
a
first
attempt
and
I
could
progress
at
my
own
pace.
The
writing
portfolios
I
completed
for
class
had
to
contain
at
least
one
draft
for
each
piece,
as
well
as
a
breakdown
of
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
my
work.
As
I
learned
fair
evaluative
skills,
I
realized
that
I
couldnOt
possibly
hope
to
achieve
perfection
in
detail
before
I
could
consider
a
piece
as
a
whole.
In
learning
this,
I
moved
on
from
sticking
only
to
short
poems
to
exploring
prose
and
narratives.
My
work
wasnOt
genius,
but
every
now
and
then
a
creative
spark
saw
me
through
to
a
proud
moment
or
two.
One
year
later,
my
high
school
delivered
the
perfect
challenges.
As
the
first
two
years
served
as
equalizers,
the
curriculum
focused
on
clarifying
all
basic
elements
of
writing--including
the
dreaded
grammar
lessons.
However,
I
was
amazed
at
how
easily
comprehension
came
to
me
when
I
stopped
telling
myself
I
was
behind;
until
my
sophomore
year,
I
defined
a
grammatically
incorrect
sentence
as
just
sounding
wrong.
Now
that
I
finally
understood
why
this
was
so,
proper
writing
started
to
seem
a
little
less
mysterious
and
a
little
more
achievable.
As
can
be
expected
in
high
school,
I
began
to
grasp
writing
at
deeper
levels.
Never
having
been
a
voracious
reader,
though,
I
lived
unaware
of
the
power
of
great
of
writing.
However,
one
particular
teacher
literally
placed
the
evidence
right
under
my
nose,
showing
me
that
literature
gave
(and
writing
required)
huge
amounts
of
insight
into
the
human
experience,
which
fascinated
me.
As
a
result,
writing
about
literature,
the
most
frequent
reason
for
academic
essays,
became
truly
enchanting
for
me,
as
did
the
rest
of
the
English
subject.
My
teacher
responded
with
equal
enthusiasm,
which
did
the
trick
once
again:
her
continual
words
of
encouragement
concerning
the
depth
of
my
work
brought
me
to
believe
that
my
writing
might
actually
be
worthwhile.
I
still
tended
to
scrutinize
my
work,
but
I
did
so
with
confidence.
My
drive
to
be
the
outside-the-box
writer
was
no
longer
out
of
fear,
but
curiosity.
Now
having
a
bit
more
confidence,
I
wanted
to
find
my
own
confident
voice
and
style
for
use
outside
the
classroom.
Though
I
certainly
enjoyed
the
romantic
symbolism
and
cleverness
of
the
novels
and
Romantic
era
poetry
I
read
for
class,
that
style
didnOt
come
naturally
to
me
quite
yet.
However,
since
my
sister,
the
NEnglish
person,O
had
no
trouble
with
it,
I
felt
a
bit
like
an
underdog
in
comparison.
I
was
elated,
then,
when
I
came
across
SalingerOs
Catcher
in
the
Rye
on
my
required
reading
list.
The
book
was
not
written
in
what
I
considered
to
be
the
more
traditional
or
laudable
style
of
writing;
it
instead
felt
raw
and
full
of
blunt
honesty.
At
the
same
time,
though,
it
merited
praise
and
popularity.
I
encountered
a
fellow
underdog
in
both
Salinger
and
his
main
character,
both
of
whom
found
their
own
way.
Though
it
seems
obvious
now,
I
realized
then
that
I
could
express
myself
however
I
preferred
and
still
be
well
received.
What
did
my
style
matter
as
long
as
I
believed
in
it
and
enjoyed
it?
After
reading
the
book,
I
began
taking
part
in
a
popular
practice
among
my
friends:
online,
peer-viewed
journaling.
This
proved
a
lesson
in
and
of
itself
in
(melo)dramatic
prose.
Though
not
without
the
occasional
babbling
entry,
the
journal
was
a
great
tool
for
expression
and
practice.
Over
the
last
three
years,
IOve
written
in
many
genres
in
the
journal,
but
its
biggest
benefits
have
been
a
buildup
of
confidence
in
and
genuine
enjoyment
for
my
writing.
For
example,
when
I
was
later
assigned
to
write
a
journal
to
accompany
a
class
reading,
I
didnOt
think
twice
about
putting
my
own
feelings
and
opinions
into
my
work.
Since
I
usually
wrote
what
I
thought
a
teacher
wanted
to
hear,
this
was
a
big
featNwith
incredibly
freeing
results.
I
was
not
quite
as
natural,
though,
when
it
came
to
writing
the
longer,
deliver-the-facts
assignments.
Writing
DBQOs
and
projects
longer
than
four
pages
were
long
battles
with
pages
of
casualties.
My
specialty
was
short,
intense
style,
not
maintenance.
This
made
for
little
continuity
in
quality
and
tone
from
page
to
page.
I
never
knew
where
to
begin.
What
details
should
I
pick?
How
much
was
too
much
information?
Did
a
good
writer
automatically
have
instinct
for
these
things?
I
could
write
a
thesis
with
a
few
supporting
details,
but
beyond
three
pages
I
lost
steam.
Of
course,
I
knew
this
was
a
result
of
my
tendency
to
overthink,
but
until
I
could
hand
in
a
major
piece
I
felt
proud
of,
I
allowed
these
questions
to
plague
me.
As
if
on
cue,
the
miraculous
English
teacher
again
came
to
the
rescue
with
the
notorious
junior
year
research
paper.
My
topic,
the
psychological
impact
of
fairy
tales
on
children,
was
slightly
out
of
my
league,
therefore
presenting
a
perfect
challenge
as
to
how
deeply
I
could
skillfully
explore
the
topic.
Knowing
the
assignment
served
as
an
exercise
in
overcoming
obstacles
such
as
these,
my
teacher
ensured
that
every
step
and
every
student
received
full
attention
and
a
strong
thesis
to
work
with.
In
the
weeks
leading
up
to
the
due
date,
source
lists
and
quotations
were
given
deadlines.
Paraphrases
and
summaries
were
to
be
put
on
index
cards
and
graded.
Transitions
and
MLA
formats
were
drilled.
Though
I
sometimes
resisted
this
structured
writing
out
of
habit,
refusing
to
believe
that
I
could
decide
on
a
topic
and
an
outline
weeks
in
advance
of
a
deadline,
I
had
to
abide
to
do
well.
Finally,
after
weeks
of
roasting
on
my
own
fire,
I
was
blatantly
told
in
my
final
paper
meeting:
NJust
stop;
you
are
being
way
too
hard
on
yourself.
You
did
a
great
job.O
I
had
never
been
so
proud
of
an
A.
By
my
last
year
of
high
school,
academic
writing
became
a
joy.
The
analytical
writing
done
in
English
class
relied
strongly
on
the
insight
and
creativity
on
which
I
thrived.
I
excitedly
anticipated
forward
to
the
writing
portion
of
any
AP
test,
English
or
otherwise;
I
loved
knowing
I
could
write
about
a
reading
intelligently.
I
even
enjoyed
the
write-for-your-life
sense
of
urgency
that
accompanied
timed
essays.
My
proudest
moment
yet
as
writer
also
arrived
that
year
when
I
completed
my
college
essay.
The
knowledge
that
my
essayNcreated
in
my
own
style
and
by
my
own
guidelinesNreceived
constant,
positive
feedback
from
faculty
and
family
gave
me
the
final
push
to
identify
myself
not
just
as
a
NquantO
but
however
I
desired.
As
for
college
itself,
I
felt
strongly
prepared,
yet
challenged
at
a
proper
level.
Initially,
I
let
my
nerves
and
excitement
get
the
best
of
me
and
slipped
into
my
old
habit
of
using
complexity
as
a
weapon;
thankfully,
though,
my
FYS
professor
helped
me
remember
that
Nsometimes,
simplicity
is
a
virtue.O
After
the
initial
adjustment
period,
I
fell
into
step
much
more
quickly
than
I
had
expected,
finding
that
help
was
always
available
even
if
I
had
just
one
question.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I
wanted
to
write
even
more.
This
resulted
in
what
is
now
an
ever-growing
Word
Document
that
I
fill
when
my
usual
inner
monologue
sounds
particularly
inspired.
Small
portions
of
short
stories,
poems,
and
the
occasional
script
side
abound
in
itNfor
no
other
purpose,
at
least
at
the
moment,
than
my
own
enjoyment.
I
write
without
reservation,
viewing
writing
as
not
only
something
I
can
do,
but
one
of
my
main
channels
of
expression.
Thanks
to
the
constant
encouragement,
care,
and
honest
opinion
given
to
me
by
those
who
always
wanted
me
to
improve,
I
can
sayNwith
confidenceNthat
I
am
a
writer.
Not
a
perfect
one
by
any
means,
but
one
who
enjoys
the
process;
one
who
eagerly
looks
forward
to
the
next
opportunity
to
learn.
I
now
keep
in
mind,
though,
that
my
entire
journey
so
far
can
be
attributed
to
those
who
could
see
more
in
my
accomplishments
than
I
ever
could,
whether
I
was
writing
a
paperNor
one
single
letter.
