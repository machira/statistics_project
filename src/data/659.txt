YMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Sixteen
years
ago
my
writing
career
began
in
earnest.
It
was
in
the
fall
of
1993,
which
saw
young
kindergartner
blossoming
from
toddlerhood
to
boyhood
under
the
tutelage
of
Mrs.
Black.
My
shoe
size
was
a
kid's
seven,
I
weighed
a
robust
seventy
pounds,
and
each
day
when
I
got
home
from
school
at
2:30
I
would
rush
to
my
little
bean
bag
chair
for
the
latest
episode
of
NBarney
and
FriendsO.
Now
the
fall
of
2011
approaches.
I
have
successfully
completed
the
stages
of
boyhood,
tweenhood,
teenagehood,
and
now
am
on
the
cusp
of
graduating
from
young-adulthood
into
real-life
hood
.
In
this
time
I
have
upgraded
to
a
men's
thirteen
shoe,
have
amassed
an
additional
one-hundred-and-fifty-five
pounds,
and,
until
a
moment
ago,
Barney
had
honestly
not
crossed
my
mind
in
more
than
a
decade
(NLaw
&
Order:
SVUO
is
more
my
thing
these
days).
EEEEEEEEFor
all
the
growth
and
development
that
has
occurred
in
my
life
over
these
last
sixteen
years
though,
my
foundational
philosophy
in
writing
has
remained
remarkably
sturdy.
From
the
very
first
memory
of
my
English
writing
experience
up
until
this
piece
itself,
I
always
grasp
that
pencil
or
set
my
hands
on
that
keyboard
with
the
same
principal
goal:
be
creative/extraordinary,
make
it
stand
out,
make
it
different
and
take
risks
doing
so.
Coming
out
of
one's
literary
comfort
zone
is
the
way
one
learns,
improves,
and
ultimately
gets
to
experience
the
thrill
that
writing
can
offer.
Reflecting
over
my
own
writing
history,
all
sixteen
years
that
I
find
accessible
to
memory
at
least,
I
find
an
unrelenting
mission
to
keep
writing
fun,
at
times
doing
so
at
the
expense
of
structure,
grammar,
aesthetics,
and/or
any
other
traditional
English
mores.
This
has
resulted
in
a
number
of
pieces
that
have
been
scolded
and
scoffed
at.
It
has
also
resulted
in
even
more
pieces
that
have
received
kudos
and
praise.
Overall,
the
feedback
I
have
received
on
my
writing
has
helped
me
to
best
blend
my
desires
to
pump
creative
life
into
my
creations
with
the
necessity
of
staying,
barely
at
times,
within
the
realm
of
the
academically/professionally
acceptable.
At
twenty-one
years
old
I
feel
I
have
finally
just
about
reached
an
appropriate
balance.
But
the
journey
to
twenty-one
has
yielded
sixteen
years
of
lessons
that
are
plenty
worthy
of
reflection...
EEEEEEEE...so
back
to
Mrs.
Black.
I
have
always
liked
to
brag
about
my
impeccably
clean
elementary
school
criminal
record:
not
once
was
I
ever
sent
down
the
hall
to
Mr.
Perry's
principal's
office
for
disciplinary
purposes
during
my
time
at
Tuftonboro
Central
School.
But
as
a
young
kindergartener
I
came
as
close
as
ever
to
putting
a
blemish
on
my
clean
character,
completely
attributable
to
my
early
tendencies
of
creative
writing.
A
lot
of
memories
about
my
kindergarten
experiences
are
foggy
to
me,
but
this
one
from
this
day
is
clear
as
crystal.
Adam
Jordan
was
on
my
left,
Ashley
Jewett
on
my
right,
as
the
three
of
us
sat
at
the
Nhandwriting
stationO
in
the
back
right
corner
of
the
classroom.
It
was
late
fall
and
for
the
past
two
or
so
months
my
classmates
and
I
had
been
perfecting
our
handwriting
by
focusing
on
the
first
thirteen
letters
of
the
alphabet.
On
this
day
the
letter
of
focus
was
the
letter
NMO.
Adam,
Ashley
and
I
were
charged
with
mastering
its
corners
and
curves
in
both
the
capital
and
lower
case
forms,
NMO
and
NmO.
We
were
charged
with
constructing
the
letter
over
and
over
again
in
row
after
row.
This
is
where
my
struggle
against
the
conventional
written
word
first
began.
EEEEEEEEI
remember
wanting
my
NM's
&
m'sO
to
be
creative,
to
stand
out,
and
to
be
different...so
I
took
a
bit
of
Eliterary
license
when
Mrs.
Black's
attention
was
diverted
to
the
math
group
practicing
counting
with
beans
in
the
middle
of
the
classroom.
EInstead
of
separating
my
NM'sO
into
individual
letters,
I
decided
to
connect
them
one
after
another
into
an
endless
unit
of
letter.
Voila.
I
was
so
proud
of
myself;
my
first
true
work
of
literary
art.
Granted,
there
was
no
apparent
content
by
which
to
judge
my
NcreativityO
and
because
of
this
one
might
be
quick
dismiss
my
action
as
nothing
more
than
student
stubbornness
and
an
inability
or
unwillingness
to
follow
directions.
That
is
how
Mrs.
Black
interpreted
it,
as
an
undisciplined
student
who
could
not
cooperate.
She
scolded
me.
Told
me
to
never
do
what
I
had
just
done
again.
That
if
I
did,
such
an
action
would
be
cashed
in
for
a
free
trip
down
the
hall
for
a
visit
with
Mr.
Perry.
EEEEEEEEHaving
had
nothing
but
good
intentions
with
my
action
I
remember
being
quite
upset
with
my
teacher's
reaction
to
my
work.
I
had
attempted
to
make
my
work
stand
out
and
to
impress
my
audience.
Instead,
in
making
my
work
stand
out,
I
had
made
my
audience
disappointed
in
me.
The
birth
of
my
young
writing
career
was
thus
off
to
a
most
discouraging
start,
one
that
served
as
a
classic
case
of
Newtonian
physics
within
the
English
language:
for
every
action
there
is
an
equal
and
opposite
reaction.
My
writing
action
had
caused
me
to
be
exceedingly
proud
because
of
my
creativity.
The
reaction
was
exactly
opposite:
excessive
disappointment.
EEEEEEEEWhile
this
episode
might
be
interpreted
as
one
of
minuscule
importance
within
the
twenty-one
years
of
my
life,
it
actually
marks
a
remarkably
revealing
point
in
the
history
of
my
writing
career.
Upon
reflection,
it
is
a
remarkably
revealing
point
for
two
very
important
reasons.
EEEEEEEEFirst,
this
event,
the
earliest
I
can
clearly
recall
from
a
sixteen
year
writing
career,
demonstrates
the
ideals
and
goals
I
strive
to
achieve
in
my
writing
to
this
day.
It
shows
how
even
in
my
earliest
stages
I
never
cared
about
making
my
writing
NperfectO
or
NnormalO;
instead
I
cared
about
catching
my
audience's
attention
and
doing
so
at
some
cost
to
convention.
When
I
look
at
my
most
recent
writing
as
well
as
writing
I
have
saved
from
my
high
school
and
early
elementary
years
(and
let
me
tell
you,
I
save
just
about
everything)
I
see
a
remarkable
consistency
in
style
among
the
continued
improvements
in
the
technical
aspects
and
sophistication
of
my
writing.
It
is
a
consistency
which
might
be
best
characterized
as
a
tendency
to
consciously
play
with
words
rather
than
just
use
them,
to
bury
any
fear
of
judgment,
and
to
at
times
trust
my
instinct
before
my
reason
and
the
rules.
EEEEEEEESecondly,
that
little
kindergarten
episode
marks
such
an
important
event
for
that
fact
that
the
way
in
which
it
unfolded
could
have
completely
changed
the
direction
of
my
writing
forever.
My
personality
is
one
which
cannot
stand
failure
in
the
eyes
of
others
and
one
which
will
avoid
it
at
almost
any
cost.
In
Mrs.
Black's
reaction
I
had
been
relegated
to
a
failure
in
her
eyes.
EYet
I
refused
to
abandon
the
motives
that
had
put
me
in
such
a
position.
While
I
admittedly
never
again
did
anything
but
follow
very
specifically
the
directions
given
in
the
handwriting
station,
I
also
have
never
abandoned
the
purpose
with
which
I
originally
had
deviated
from
the
rules.
Writing,
from
its
most
complex
ideas
right
down
to
its
very
core,
its
paragraphs,
sentences,
words,
and
letters,
has
always
been
about
unique
craftsmanship
in
my
life
and
that
is
why
that
one
otherwise
unmonumental
day
in
kindergarten,
one
in
which
I
am
confident
probably
does
not
even
exist
anymore
in
the
memories
of
my
teacher
or
classmates,
was
such
an
important
first
stepping
stone
on
the
way
to
becoming
the
writer
that
I
have
since
evolved
into.
EEEEEEEEIn
the
few
years
that
have
passed
since
my
kindergarten
years,
several
individual
pieces
of
writing
stick
out
in
memory
as
being
eerily
similar
to
my
kindergarten
efforts
in
the
sense
of
their
pushing
the
envelope
of
normalcy.
I
was
struck
with
two
out
of
the
ordinary
impulses
on
creative
writing
pieces
in
Mr.
Lang's
tenth
grade
American
Literature
class
at
Kingswood
High
School.
In
one
I
experimented
with
the
abandonment
of
capital
letters
completely,
in
the
other
I
said
goodbye
to
punctuation.
In
both
instances
there
was
not
a
specific
source
of
inspiration
for
either
idea,
just
me
once
again
following
some
odd
instinct
to
experiment
rather
that
following
reason
or
rules.
It
was
an
attempt
more
than
anything
to
make
the
writing
fun
for
me
and
to
spur
a
reaction
by
Mr.
Lang.
He
liked
it.
I
loved
it.
My
classmates
hated
it...
EEEEEEEE...and
that
is
somewhat
of
a
funny
thing,
because
now
I
hate
those
papers.
I
mentioned
above
how
I
indiscriminately
have
saved
nearly
all
of
my
work
from
every
level
of
education
and
this
fact
itself,
combined
with
my
natural
tendency
to
write
rather
atypically,
has
had
a
significant
effect
on
shaping
my
writing
over
more
recent
years.
Whenever
I
take
the
opportunity
to
go
through
the
stacks
of
old
papers
I
have
written
and
to
read
some
of
my
work
from
one,
two,
five,
or
ten
years
ago,
I
cannot
believe
that
what
I
thought
I
was
writing
at
that
time
was
clever
or
polished
or,
to
get
right
down
to
it,
any
good
at
all.
Sentences
I
thought
I
constructed
marvelously
twenty
months
ago
I
read
today
and
think
Nyuck.O
What
I
once
had
thought
was
me
being
clever
today
turns
into
something
I
am
embarrassed
I
produced.
But
that
is
a
risk
one
runs
when
trying
to
push
his
writing
just
far
enough
to
stay
within
the
vicinity
of
normalcy
and
convention,
but
to,
at
the
same
time,
remain
outside
of
its
area
code.
That
risk,
in
my
estimation,
is
worth
it
because
it
has
been
such
a
great
teaching
tool
to
me.
Even
though
I
now
find
much
of
my
past
writing
attempting
to
be
overly
witty
(I
can
tell
I
am
already
overly
guilty
of
this
here),
or
too
NcuteO
(guilty
here
as
well),
or
too
wordy
I
know
I
committed
these
crimes
of
conventional
writing
in
order
to
make
the
writing
more
enjoyable
for
myself.
These
unconventional
tendencies
in
my
writing,
though
most
likely
frowned
upon
by
literary
technicians,
are
what
keep
me
having
fun
in
the
moment
as
I
write.
And
though
I
frequently
look
back
myself
and
wonder
NWhy
in
the
****
did
I
write
that,
what
the
****
was
I
thinking,O
I
realize
that
I
wrote
what
I
did
because
it
was
fun
for
me
to
write
like
that.
I
enjoy
writing
very
much,
be
it
for
my
own
personal
collection
or
for
academic
reasons.
If
I
were
to
force
myself
into
being
a
Nwrite-wingerONa
writing
conservativeNfor
the
sake
of
producing
pieces
that
my
audience
would
feel
completely
comfortable
with,
at
such
a
point
I
feel
as
though
writing
would
take
on
the
form
of
a
chore.
Personally,
I
would
rather
write
the
NweirdO
way
and
love
to
do
it
rather
than
follow
each
and
every
guideline
and
labor
through
it.
The
way
I
write
might
be
odd,
but
it
is
fun.
E
EEEEEEEEMore
often
than
not,
odd
but
fun
writing
does
not
fit
into
the
academic
curriculum,
especially
when
one
is
majoring
in
Government
&
Law
and
Geology
rather
than
English.
Writing
is
turned
into
a
mechanism
of
communicative
efficiency
in
the
collegial
setting;
there
is
little
time
for
the
playfulness
of
abandoning
punctuation
or
capital
letters.
The
emphasis
on
concretely
and
deeply
presented
content
leaves
little
room
to
frolic
as
I
have
in
the
past
in
the
majority
of
the
writing
I
now
engage
in
on
a
regular
basis
(which
is
why
this
piece
has
tended
towards
unleashing
my
inner
literary
untamed
beast).
This
set
of
circumstances
has
been
cause
for
me
to
continue
to
search
out
techniques
and
strategies
that
will
continue
to
make
me
intimate
with
my
writing
and
that
will
continue
to
make
it
a
fun
challenge.
While
there
is
still
room
for
wit
in
modest
servings,
I
now
find
myself
being
able
to
engage
most
deeply
in
my
writing
by
loving
what
I
am
writing
about,
not
necessarily
from
a
topical
perspective
but
from
a
confidence
perspective.
I
find
myself
getting
the
most
thrill
out
of
my
writing
when
it
incorporates
the
harvest
of
my
deepest
thought
processes
and
is
paired
with
thorough
and
deep
research
of
whatever
topic
it
is
I
am
writing
about.
The
majority
of
the
creativity
that
I
now
feature
in
my
writing
comes
from
attempts
to
synthesize
new
ideas
about
whatever
topic
it
is
I
am
writing
on.
Just
as
my
old
stylistic
creativity
was
a
bit
on
the
radical
side,
tipping
the
scales
at
a
weight
admittedly
getting
close
to
absurdity,
sometimes
the
creative
thesis
ideas
I
attempt
to
research
or
the
atypical
conclusions
I
attempt
to
draw
are
just
as
NwackyO...
E
EEEEEEEE...but
in
being
NwackyO
I
would
hate
for
the
current
state
of
my
academic
writing
to
be
dismissed
as
unreasoned,
for
following
the
laws
of
reason
are
what
make
academic
writing
so
exciting
to
me.
I
had
mentioned
previously
my
reliance
on
instinct
rather
than
reason
in
my
early
history.
There
is
no
room
for
this
in
the
academic
arena.
Thus,
whereas
I
once
found
excitement
in
writing
by
avoiding
reasoned
choices
and
relying
on
how
I
felt
rather
than
how
I
thought,
I
now
pump
excitement
into
my
writing
by
attempting
to
explore
questions
beyond
their
obvious
reasons,
pushing
reason
to
its
limits.
One
paper
I
authored
recently,
analyzing
a
decision
by
the
New
Hampshire
Supreme
Court,
demonstrated
this
new
tendency
of
mine
particularly
well.
In
searching
for
a
reason
of
why
the
court
ruled
as
it
did
I
developed
a
complicated
thesis
with
little
likelihood
of
being
the
NrealO
explanation
but
with
a
foundation
deep
in
reasoned
analysis
nonetheless.
The
reasons
I
posited
were
of
the
abstract
variety,
some
having
read
the
paper
might
label
me
a
conspiracy
theorist,
but
I
was
able
to
successfully
reason
my
way
to
each
and
every
conclusion.
Overall,
the
general
theme
of
my
writing
career
can
be
marked
by
an
unrelenting
mission
to
have
fun
while
I
write;
I
best
accomplish
this
mission
by
bending
the
ordinary
expectations
just
a
tad
or
two.
While
the
words
I
produce
in
my
writing
works
are
intended
ultimately
for
an
audience
at
large,
they
flow
from
mind
during
creation
with
the
dual
purpose
of
entertaining
myself
as
I
write
them.
Monotonous,
dry,
succinct,
Nright
to
the
pointO
writing
can
be
some
of
the
best
writing
in
some
contexts,
but
it
is
not
for
me.
Writing
lends
the
opportunity
for
self
discovery;
there
is
so
little
opportunity
for
self
discovery
within
the
ordinary
and
mundane.
