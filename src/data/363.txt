The
Importance
of
Writing
in
My
Life
"When
I
grow
up
I
want
to
be
a
writer,
actress,
or
politician".
I
wasn't
a
very
decisive
child.
I
always
wanted
to
be
one
of
three
or
four
different
occupations
"when
I
grew
up".
But
throughout
my
life,
I
knew
that
writing
would
play
an
important
part
in
what
I
did.
I
don't
remember
the
first
thing
I
wrote.
I
don't
remember
my
first
writing
assignment.
What
I
do
remember
is
huge
sheets
of
green
lined
paper.
I
would
tightly
clench
a
pencil
in
my
hands,
and
practice
printing
my
alphabet.
Over
time
my
sheets
became
better
and
better.
In
fourth
grade
they
became
sheets
filled
with
cursive
letters.
I
remember
writing
in
my
vocabulary
book.
I
would
practice
word
definitions
and
fill-in-the
blanks.
My
friend
and
I
would
draw
doodles
in
one
another's
books
when
we
corrected
the
assignments.
Although
I
didn't
realize
it
at
the
time,
I
was
developing
skills
that
would
become
vital
to
communicating
my
thoughts
with
other
people.
In
the
summer
before
middle
school,
my
future
teacher
(Ms.
Baker)
had
an
assignment
for
her
students:
we
were
to
write
a
letter
to
her
telling
her
all
about
ourselves.
When
we
got
to
school
the
letters
were
posted
on
a
bulletin
board
and
were
full
of
comments.
I
remember
that
my
letter
was
far
longer
than
the
one
or
two
page
required
length.
I
had
gotten
so
excited
by
the
prospect
of
writing
and
the
idea
that
someone
was
interested
in
what
I
had
to
say
that
I
just
kept
writing.
Ms.
Baker
continued
to
nurture
my
writing
throughout
the
year.
The
students
in
her
class
were
instructed
to
keep
a
journal,
and
Ms.
Baker
would
collect
them
a
few
times
a
marking
period
to
grade
them
and
comment
on
them.
I
was
really
excited
by
this
assignment.
I
filled
two
and
a
half
booklets
with
my
journal
entries.
I
still
remember
that
I
really
liked
her
as
a
teacher
because
I
felt
she
was
interested
in
my
writing.
I
could
tell
the
journal
all
about
myself:
what
I
did,
what
I
felt,
what
I
thought.
During
one
of
the
very
first
days
of
school,
Ms.
Baker
talked
to
me
in
what
I
thought
was
a
harsh
tone.
I
thought
that
she
was
mad
at
me
and
I
was
upset
about
it.
I
remember
I
wrote
about
it
in
my
journal,
and
she
wrote
and
told
me
that
she
wasn't
mad
at
me
at
all.
I
realized
then
that
the
written
word
was
a
great
form
of
communication,
a
great
way
to
express
things
I
didn't
know
how
to
express
verbally.
Writing
also
gave
me
a
feeling
of
importance
because
as
a
result
of
it,
an
adult
was
reading
my
thoughts
and
responding
as
though
they
were
worthwhile.
I
also
started
to
write
for
fun
around
this
time
in
my
life.
My
brother
and
I
had
a
babysitter
during
the
summer
between
sixth
and
seventh
grade.
Our
summer
days
were
full
of
hide-and-go-seek,
swimming,
and
games
of
tag.
I
looked
up
to
her
like
an
older
sister
or
cousin.
When
the
summer
was
over,
I
found
that
I
missed
my
babysitter.
I
decided
to
write
a
story
with
her
in
it,
entitled
"Dominica's
Quest".
I
drew
pictures
of
the
characters,
and
wrote
a
long,
detailed
tale.
I
was
so
proud
of
my
story.
I
had
had
fun
creating
it,
and
the
time
I
spent
writing
had
taken
my
mind
off
of
the
fact
that
summer
was
ending.
Writing
offered
me
a
creative
outlet
for
my
energy.
I
always
loved
to
do
creative
writing.
Every
Thanksgiving,
the
adults
in
my
family
would
cook
dinner
and
watch
television,
and
my
cousins
and
I
would
go
in
the
basement
and
prepare
our
Thanksgiving
play.
I
would
write
the
plays,
and
my
cousin,
brother,
and
I
would
make
costumes
and
decorations.
Then
after
dinner,
we
would
act
out
our
skit
in
front
of
the
family.
I
wrote
poems
in
high
school
to
help
me
get
through
the
troubled
teenage
years.
Writing
was
(and
still
is)
a
kind
of
therapy
for
me.
I
used
it
to
deal
with
problems
with
the
guys
I
dated,
and
other
thoughts
and
concerns.
I
forced
all
of
my
poems
to
rhyme,
so
that
now
that
I
read
them,
they
sound
amateurish.
During
high
school,
my
academic
writing
began
to
take
on
a
more
serious
and
analytic
quality.
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
in
the
Gifted
and
Talented
class
at
my
elementary,
middle,
and
high
school.
During
junior
year
of
high
school,
each
GT
student
was
required
to
do
an
independent
study.
We
were
allowed
great
flexibility
in
our
choice
of
assignment;
we
were
only
required
to
meet
occasionally
with
the
teacher
to
go
over
our
progress,
and
to
present
our
study
at
a
fair
in
the
library.
I
decided
to
study
selfesteem
and
its
effects
on
teenagers.
I
passed
out
surveys
to
students
at
my
school,
interviewed
some
people,
and
read
many
books
on
self-esteem.
I
compiled
and
analyzed
my
information
and
made
a
booklet
to
hand
out
to
students.
I
once
again
remember
a
feeling
of
pride
in
my
finished
product.
I
felt
that
I
might
be
able
to
reach
out
and
help
students
by
providing
them
with
information,
poems,
and
personal
insight
into
selfesteem.
I
really
learned
a
lot
about
literature
and
writing
during
my
senior
year
of
high
school.
I
was
lucky
enough
to
have
Mr.
Runyon
for
my
A.P.
English
class.
Mr.
Runyon
was
a
retired
soldier
who
now
taught
English.
He
was
a
gruff
man
with
a
dry
sense
of
humor;
we
all
adored
him.
He
made
us
move
our
chairs
into
a
circle
so
we
could
see
one
another
while
we
discussed
plays
and
poetry.
We
read
and
discussed
a
wide
assortment
of
writings.
Every
few
weeks
we
would
have
a
paper
to
write
about
our
readings.
Mr.
Runyon
had
a
different
style
for
assigning
papers.
He
would
hand
out
two
sheets
of
yellow
lined
paper
as
we
walked
into
class,
and
would
tell
us
we
had
twenty
minutes
to
write
about
the
assignment
he
would
hand
out
to
us
(which
would
be
a
story
we
had
read
earlier
in
the
week,
or
a
short
passage
that
was
new
to
us).
At
first
I
panicked
at
this
new
idea.
How
was
I
supposed
to
write
a
good
paper
in
twenty
minutes?
I
needed
time
to
sit
and
reread
the
material,
and
digest
the
information.
I
needed
to
write
rough
drafts
and
correct
them.
I
couldn't
take
this
pressure!
I
needed
time
to
think!
I
think
that
this
writing
method
helped
me
tremendously.
It
made
me
really
think
about
the
material
and
pick
out
the
most
important
information.
It
made
me
quickly
analyze
my
options
and
choose
what
I
thought
to
be
my
strongest
argument.
It
gave
me
the
confidence
to
write.
Most
of
the
papers
I
wrote
for
Mr.
Runyon's
class
were
analytical
in
nature.
Mr.
Runyon
really
stressed
using
examples
from
the
stories
to
back
up
an
argument.
I
learned
to
use
quotes
and
examples
from
the
text
to
support
my
statements.
Mr.
Runyon
would
always
provide
us
with
constructive
feedback
on
our
papers
and
allow
us
to
rewrite
ones
that
we
had
done
poorly.
I
did
pretty
well
on
his
assignments,
and
his
positive
remarks
helped
add
to
my
confidence
in
myself
as
a
writer.
I
had
always
thought
of
poetry
as
something
hard
to
read
and
understand.
Mr.
Runyon
taught
us
strictly
poetry
for
a
month's
worth
of
classes.
We
worked
through
them
together,
and
I
really
felt
I
grew
as
an
English
student
as
a
result
of
learning
poetry.
My
new
admiration
of
poetry
was
evident
in
my
senior
year
research
paper.
I
decided
to
write
an
analysis
of
poems
by
John
Donne.
I
researched
his
poems,
read
literary
critiques
about
him,
and
wrote
a
four-page
analytical
paper.
By
now,
my
writing
method
had
changed
from
pencil
and
paper
to
computer,
and
my
writing
style
had
become
more
sophisticated
as
a
result
of
the
demands
of
my
Literature
teacher.
Mr.
Runyon
was
a
strict
teacher.
He
told
us
that
his
class
was
taught
like
a
college
class;
if
we
could
survive
A.P.
Literature
with
him,
we
could
make
it
in
college.
I
think
Mr.
Runyon
was
right.
He
brought
my
writing
style
up
from
high
school
level
to
something
more
advanced.
He
gave
me
great
tools
for
college
writing,
and
gave
me
the
confidence
to
succeed.
Perhaps
most
importantly,
Mr.
Runyon
gave
me
a
better
appreciation
for
Literature,
and
a
desire
to
read
and
learn.
During
my
first
year
of
college,
my
F.Y.S.
class
presented
another
teacher
who
challenged
my
method
of
writing.
My
professor
told
us
that
we
had
to
write
four
papers
throughout
the
semester.
That
part
of
the
assignment
was
okay;
I
could
handle
that.
But
we
had
to
choose
our
own
topics.
The
papers
could
be
about
anything
that
had
to
deal
with
any
of
the
books
we
read,
anything
we
discussed
in
class,
or
anything
else
that
related
to
the
course
that
might
interest
us.
As
a
freshman
in
college,
I
was
very
scared.
How
would
I
know
what
the
right
topic
was
for
me
to
write
on
for
my
first
college
paper?
How
did
I
know
what
was
expected?
At
the
beginning
of
the
semester,
I
stuck
very
close
to
the
readings
in
choosing
my
topics
for
the
papers.
But
as
the
semester
progressed,
I
began
to
explore
topics
that
interested
me
and
wrote
about
them.
I
took
information
from
the
books
I
read
and
used
them
as
starting
places
to
learn
about
real
world
problems.
I
went
from
analyzing
the
readings
in
class
to
applying
them
to
other
topics.
I
grew
as
a
writer
as
a
result
of
this
teaching
method.
Another
class
that
shaped
me
as
a
writer
was
History
106.
This
class
met
once
a
week,
and
students
were
expected
to
read
a
book
for
every
class
and
answer
questions
about
the
book
that
amounted
to
about
4-5
typed
pages.
We
were
also
required
to
write
a
comparison
of
two
of
the
novels
we
read,
and
were
assigned
a
research
paper
on
a
famous
person
relating
to
the
course.
This
was
my
first
research
paper
in
college,
and
it
taught
me
a
lot
about
how
to
do
research,
how
to
use
the
library,
how
to
compile
large
amounts
of
information
(a
whole
person's
life)
into
a
concise
paper.
I
ended
up
getting
into
the
assignment
and
writing
more
than
required
-
I
didn't
want
to
cut
short
such
important
information.
I
learned
how
to
construct
a
thesis
about
a
person's
life
that
was
applicable
to
twenty-two
pages
of
material
and
make
sure
that
the
thesis
was
present
and
supported
throughout
the
paper.
I
felt
tremendous
satisfaction
after
completing
my
paper.
I
felt
that
if
I
could
write
that
paper,
I
could
write
anything!
If
History
106
was
the
class
that
gave
me
confidence
in
my
writing,
Literary
Questions
was
the
class
that
sealed
my
fate
as
an
English
Major.
I
knew
I
was
interested
in
English
before
that
class,
but
that
class
made
English
exhilarating.
We
would
sometimes
spend
twenty
minutes
analyzing
one
line
of
a
poem.
I
discovered
the
depth
and
power
of
writing
as
a
result
of
that
class.
Allusions,
metaphors,
similes
-
all
had
new
meanings
to
me.
I
was
allowed
to
explore
literature,
and
write
criticisms
and
analyses
of
interesting
works.
I
wrote
one
paper
on
The
Tempest.
I
was
told
to
write
a
five-page
paper
on
fifteen
lines
of
the
play.
At
first
the
task
seemed
a
tough
one
-
I
had
to
interpret
Shakespeare,
and
somehow
find
enough
information
to
write
a
long
paper
on
such
a
small
amount
of
material.
I
managed
to
find
a
lot
of
meaning
in
the
passage,
and
construct
a
sound
nine-page
argument.
I
had
never
realized
how
carefully
authors
choose
their
words,
and
how
much
meaning
can
be
conveyed
by
a
short
phrase.
I
grew
a
deeper
appreciation
for
literature
and
the
writing
process
as
a
result
of
that
class.
Literary
Questions
also
involved
writing
two
poems
modeled
after
works
by
two
of
the
poets
we
read
in
class.
I
was
originally
frightened
by
this
idea
-
how
was
I
going
to
write
a
good
poem?
All
of
my
poems
in
high
school
were
silly
rhymes.
Once
I
started
the
project,
I
really
got
into
it.
I
felt
that
my
poems
were
powerful
statements
about
me
or
about
life.
I
was
excited
to
be
able
to
use
the
symbolism
I
learned
about
in
class.
I
particularly
enjoyed
rereading
The
Awakening.
I
found
the
symbolism
and
themes
amazing.
As
a
part
of
my
final,
I
added
another
chapter
to
the
finale
of
the
book.
I
had
so
much
fim
creating
the
characters
and
recording
what
I
believed
their
actions
would
be.
I
requested
that
a
copy
of
my
final
be
sent
to
me,
and
was
really
happy
that
my
professor
had
enjoyed
my
ending
and
found
it
consistent
with
the
rest
of
the
book.
As
I
have
come
to
understand
myself
better,
I
feel
that
I
have
better
come
to
understand
writing's
impact
on
me.
I
have
found
that
I
like
dealing
with
words
more
than
with
conversation.
I
like
the
fact
that
with
writing,
I
can
sit
and
look
at
the
entire
picture,
choose
my
argument,
and
draw
information
from
the
text
to
support
that
argument.
I
feel
that
my
writing
has
grown
and
matured
through
the
years.
I
think
that
my
change
in
writing
is
most
evident
from
my
college
years.
My
writing
has
grown
more
analytical
and
sophisticated,
as
I
have
gained
more
experience
with
writing.
I
now
think
of
writing
as
more
of
a
process
than
an
outcome.
I
like
to
take
notes
on
a
reading,
and
then
write,
rewrite,
rewrite,
revise,
rewrite,
and
rewrite.
I
like
to
sit
down
with
someone
and
discuss
my
writing
and
ways
to
improve
it.
It's
important
to
me
to
take
the
time
to
make
sure
that
what
I
put
forth
in
my
writing
is
my
best
work.
I
feel
that
over
the
years
I
have
not
only
grown
as
a
writer,
but
as
someone
who
appreciates
the
written
word.
