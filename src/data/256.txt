I
have
always
enjoyed
the
art
of
writing.
For
as
long
as
I
have
remembered,
I
have
embraced
it
for
its
primary
purpose,
that
of
communication.
Secondarily,
writing
has
also
proven
to
be
a
time-honored
and
trusted
way
for
me
to
further
explore
my
feelings,
relax,
and
learn.
My
earliest
remembered
experience
with
writing
stems
as
far
back
as
the
first
grade,
when
I
first
began
to
keep
a
daily
journal.
In
it,
I
recorded
my
dreams
and
desires,
hopes
and
wishes,
some
of
which
are
quite
humorous
whenever
I
look
back
on
them.
In
my
journal,
a
habit
which
has
stayed
with
me
to
the
present
day,
I
document
nearly
everything
that
has
happened
to
me,
in
addition
to
everything
that
I
wish
could
happen
to
me.
In
contemplation,
I
have
found
that
a
diary
is
the
surest
way
to
hold
on
to
memories
because
it
is
a
series
of
images
preserving
one's
thoughts
at
various
stages
of
their
lifetime.
More
recently,
my
journal
is
comparable
to
a
scrapbook
as
opposed
to
the
romantic
idealism
of
a
traditional
diary.
My
scrapbook
is
made
up
of
anything
that
I
have
ever
found
interesting
and
looks
distinctly
eclectic;
it
is
vividly
alive
with
much
thought
and
confusion
entwined
with
the
fading
scent
of
glue
and
tape.
I
do
not
remember
ever
having
any
negative
thoughts
concerning
my
writing.
It
is
my
first
true
love
and
a
decidedly
stable
factor
in
my
life.
It
has
also
been,
at
times,
a
passion
which
has
subjected
me
to
much
ridicule.
In
the
third
grade,
an
assignment
was
given
to
me
for
the
sole
purpose
of
understanding
and
noting
what
people
observe
in
daily
activities.
For
one
month,
I
was
required
to
observe
people
and
record
everything
that
I
saw.
Being
that
I
live
in
New
York
City,
I
had
a
wealth
of
things
to
observe
and
write
about,
particularly
because
public
transportation
took
me
everywhere
that
I
ever
wanted
to
go.
Therefore,
I
wrote
about
virtually
anyone
that
I
saw
passing
by
on
the
street,
riding
on
a
train,
or
stepping
onto
the
bus.
In
a
month,
I
filled
up
an
entire
black
composition
notebook,
commenting
on
people
that
I
saw
sleeping
in
the
realm
of
public
transport.
I
described
their
physical
attributes,
and
delved
into
my
fancies
as
I
speculated
what
their
lives
were
like
and
who
they
were.
I
received
an
"A"
on
that
assignment
and
it
was
proudly
received.
But
aside
from
the
grade,
what
I
remember
is
my
teacher
saying
that
I
wrote
"like
a
spy."
To
me,
that
remark
was
quite
a
compliment,
for
spies
led
exciting
lives
and
did
even
more
exciting
things.
For
a
while,
I
donned
dark
shades
and
wore
my
father's
oversized
work
coat
in
an
attempt
to
imitate
Sherlock
Holmes,
only
female.
I
envisioned
myself
to
be
an
elementary
school
detective,
the
Nancy
Drew
of
Queens,
and
much,
much
more.
Each
day
I
stared
at
people
in
vain
attempts
to
"see"
their
souls.
It
was
an
influential
point
of
my
life
and
a
seemingly
simple
assignment
taught
me
how
to
truly
observe.
It
taught
me
to
watch
people
and
to
look
far
beyond
carefully
constructed
exteriors
designed
to
mask
the
truth;
subsequently,
I
was
able
to
distinguish
illusion
from
life's
harsh
realities.
As
I
grew
older,
school
writing
assignments
became
increasingly
complicated
and
research
oriented.
By
fifth
grade,
each
day
I
wrote
three
current
events
summaries
pertaining
to
local,
international,
and
personal
interest
news
articles.
Those
repetitious
assignments
forced
me
to
become
aware
of
a
world
outside
of
my
relatively
tiny
street.
I
was
able
to
practice
analytical
reading
and
writing,
and
I
also
learned
more
about
what
I
liked.
As
time
wore
on,
I
realized
that
I
found
local
news
trivial
at
times,
international
news
fascinating,
and
personal
interest
stories
usually
found
themselves
in
the
venue
of
religion
or
cultural
events.
Clearly,
a
sense
of
self
was
emerging.
These
kinds
of
school
assignments
persisted
until
grade
six,
where
I
encountered
one
of
the
most
cutting
critiques
of
my
writing
career.
One
of
my
peers
offhandedly
remarked
that
I
should
write
about
things
that
were
far
more
interesting
to
"normal
people."
This
criticism
shocked
me
and
it
stung.
It
was
a
particularly
hurtful
remark
because
the
class
was
supposed
to
write
about
themselves.
Therefore,
in
my
interpretation,
it
was
not
that
my
writing
that
was
dull,
but
that
my
person
was
unentertaining.
I
interpreted
her
words
to
mean
that
writing
was
not
the
problem...
I
was
the
problem.
Although
hurtful,
the
student's
comment
taught
me
not
one,
but
two
invaluable
lessons.
First
and
foremost,
I
had
to
learn
how
to
accept
criticism;
criticism
was
not
an
attack
on
me
as
person,
but
on
acts
that
I
had
done.
This
is
an
ostensibly
minor
but
in
reality
climacteric
distinction.
Accepting
the
differences
between
the
two
enabled
me
to
mature
as
a
writer
and
as
a
human
being.
A
lesser
lesson
acquired
was
that
it
is
important
to
not
only
write
what
I
want
to
say,
but
to
write
what
people
want
to
hear.
On
the
other
hand,
it
also
impressed
upon
me
the
power
of
the
written
word,
for
it
made
me
think
about
what
could
happen
if
people
were
opposed
to
my
opinions.
If
my
peers
were
so
affected
by
a
minor
school
assignment,
imagine
what
important
issues
could
lie
again
for
me
to
challenge
people's
views!
So
there,
yet
another
tidbit
of
information
was
procured:
through
writing,
I
had
the
power
to
challenge.
Herein,
I
discovered,
laid
the
power
of
writing.
Interestingly,
during
my
final
years
of
junior
high
school,
my
poetry
was
selected
for
publication
with
the
National
Library
of
Poetry.
The
experience
added
a
note
of
pride
to
my
character,
and
it
also
made
me
feel
like
an
actual
writer.
Now,
not
only
did
I
write
things,
but
I
was
a
published
writer
whose
work
could
be
read
worldwide.
It
was
an
exhilarating
feeling,
and
the
feeling
of
accomplishment
that
I
felt
then
continues
to
be
nearly
indescribable.
Also,
at
that
time,
I
was
granted
the
opportunity
to
become
a
participant
in
a
writing
program
for
the
Gifted
and
Talented
in
John
Hopkin's
Writing
Program
for
Young
Students.
That
writing
program
was
essentially
geared
towards
all
types
of
writing
exploration.
I
wrote
about
a
given
subject,
mailed
it
to
my
writing
mentor,
and
then
received
written
critiques.
Upon
receiving
those,
I
had
to
redo
the
assignment,
incorporating
my
mentor's
suggestions.
With
that
program,
I
realized
that
writing
is
not
as
glamorous
as
a
casual
observer
would
think.
It
is
a
long
process
of
revision,
and
a
work
is
never
really
done,
only
put
on
hold
by
an
anticipated
deadline.
Another
important
writing
circumstance
of
my
life
helped
me
further
my
education.
In
one
of
the
questions
that
I
answered
for
a
high
school
entrance
examination,
I
had
to
describe
how
people
saw
me
in
a
"four
page
writing
exploration."
As
easy
as
such
a
task
appeared,
it
was
a
great
deal
harder
than
anticipated.
Ironically,
I
knew
how
I
saw
me,
and
I
could
guess
what
my
friends
and
family
saw
in
me,
but
I
had
no
idea
what
strangers
thought
of
me.
People
always
judge
other
people;
this
is
human
nature.
But
anything
in
my
character
makeup,
and
the
clothes
I
wore
or
my
speech
patterns
could
constitute
for
another
my
entire
being
in
a
second.
Consequently,
that
essay
was
yet
another
self
examination
under
the
guise
of
educational
development
and
academic
enrichment.
I
strove
for
honesty
in
that
particular
work,
yet
I
did
not
desire
to
be
so
honest
that
I
would
render
myself
a
reject
of
elitist
educational
systems.
I
have
no
idea
how
the
final
work
was
perceived,
but
the
schools
of
my
choice
did
accept
me.
In
high
school,
writing
assignments
did
not
seem
harder
but
more
comprehensive.
I
luxuriated
in
the
proposed
challenges.
Professors
demanded
more
of
me
and
as
a
result
I
completed
a
great
deal
of
research
and
more
analysis
on
an
array
of
previously
unexplored
subject
matters.
As
the
project
progressed,
I
was
beginning
to
understand
how
to
reflect
on
materials,
and
how
to
compose
papers
more
clearly
and
concisely.
By
the
time
I
graduated
from
high
school,
I
definitely
felt
ready
for
college.
I
had
researched
topics
in
a
wide
array
of
fields,
including
art,
roots
of
language,
dance,
music,
and
math,
in
addition
to
the
classic
subjects
of
literature
and
history.
My
favorite
research
paper
was
thirty
pages
long.
Not
merely
factual,
it
was
written
on
the
Japanese
Tea
Ceremony
and
was
compared
to
religious
or
spiritual
ceremonies
of
different
countries
worldwide.
I
found
that
paper
to
be
challenging
because
of
the
amount
of
research
involved.
It
was
the
first
time
that
I
had
ever
written
a
paper
without
having
any
knowledge
whatsoever
of
the
subject
matter.
An
engaging
process,
I
did
the
research
according
to
the
rules,
inclusive
of
using
index
cards
to
write
down
every
fact
and
citation.
Then,
I
outlined
the
paper
and
next
proceeded
to
arrange
the
gigantic
stack
of
cards
according
to
the
established
line
of
thinking.
In
hindsight,
I
am
now
able
to
appreciate
the
process
of
the
project,
and
the
discipline
and
order
it
required.
After
experiencing
numerous
papers
of
similar
tone,
I
was
very
excited
to
be
accepted
into
a
creative
writing
program
in
my
junior
year
of
high
school.
It
seemed
a
great
deal
more
relaxing
than
research
writing
but
it
was
not
easier.
My
professor
encouraged
us
to
push
past
our
barriers
and
to
explore
higher
levels
of
writing
intimacy.
It
was
therapeutic
almost,
and
became
a
deeply
emotional
academic
setting
that
culminated
in
a
performance
open
to
the
school.
We
wrote
on
the
medicine
wheel
system,
creating
projects
such
as
poetry,
haiku,
expository
writings,
and
short
stories.
As
a
result
of
all
of
those
experiences,
I
definitely
felt
prepared
for
college
and
was
not
disappointed.
In
fact,
the
biggest
challenge
at
Lafayette
was
not
in
writing
reasonably,
but
in
learning
how
to
improve
my
writing
style.
Now,
I
strive
not
only
for
mastery
of
the
process,
personal
enhancement
and
enjoyment,
but
for
efficiency
and
precision
of
thought.
In
my
quest
to
do
so,
I
have
learned
a
few
things.
Above
all,
I
have
learned
that
in
order
to
write
well,
I
have
to
make
the
time
to
do
so.
The
glaring
truth
is
that
most
people
do
not
make
writing
a
high
enough
priority,
meaning
that
they
intend
to
write,
but
succumb
to
distraction.
Thus,
people
use
excuses
not
to
write,
instead
of
using
writing
as
an
excuse
not
to
do
other
things.
This
is
not
only
a
bad
habit
for
the
sake
of
writing,
but
because
it
hinders
positive
academic
growth.
A
second
important
lesson
that
I
have
learned
is
that
I
need
to
change
the
type
of
writing
that
I
do;
in
effect,
I
need
to
break
a
huge
project
down
into
smaller,
more
manageable
portions.
I
need
to
recognize
that
excellent
work
does
not
create
itself,
but
is
a
byproduct
of
hours
of
hard
work
and
revision.
