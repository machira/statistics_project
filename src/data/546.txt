Reading,
Writing,
and
WA-ing:
My
First
Year
as
a
Writer
and
WA
In
my
first
exploration
of
my
history
as
a
writer,
I
came
to
the
conclusion
that
my
writing
is
most
successful
when
I
incorporate
my
critical
reading
skills
into
my
writing
process.
It
was,
after
all,
my
childus
love
of
reading
that
first
drove
me
to
scribble
stories
for
myself,
in
the
same
way
that
it
is
my
seasoned
inner
ear
that
urges
me
to
scrap,
rewrite,
and
generally
tweak
my
current
product.
It
is
an
easy
deduction
that
working
as
a
writing
associate,
essentially
a
trained
reader,
would
then
improve
my
own
writing.
In
examining
my
progress
as
a
writer
over
this
past
year,
the
biggest
change
I
have
noticed
has
not
been
any
new
skill
or
more
efficient
process,
but
rather
a
change
in
how
conscious
I
am
of
my
internal
readerus
role
in
the
writing
process.
By
comparing
my
responses
to
my
peerus
papers
and
my
responses
to
my
own
papers,
I
have
had
to
consider
where
and
why
my
standards
differ
in
terms
of
reader
expectations,
and
apply
that
knowledge
to
my
reading
and
writing.
As
a
science
major
as
well
as
an
English
major,
I
know
that
a
study
is
improved
by
reducing
the
number
of
variable
factors.
Therefore,
in
order
to
investigate
how
my
standards
for
my
writing
and
my
peersu
writing
varied,
I
would
need
a
context
in
which
little
else
about
the
pieces
varied.
In
other
words,
I
would
need
to
be
able
to
contrast
my
reactions
to
a
paper
of
my
own
that
was
in
some
way
similar
to
the
writing
the
students
I
worked
with
were
drafting.
Due
to
a
combination
of
unfamiliar
essay
topics
and
unspoken
arrogance,
I
did
not
find
such
a
set
of
papers
until
close
to
the
end
of
my
first
year
in
the
program.
The
majority
of
writing
assigned
to
the
16
first-year
students
I
worked
with
in
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
was
unstructured
and
personal
in
nature;
the
professor
wanted
students
to
write
narratives
of
their
own
history
as
a
learner,
and
later
to
write
a
longer
paper
comparing
their
school
experiences
to
those
of
past
Lafayette
students.
Small-mindedly
and
perhaps
arrogantly,
I
saw
little
resemblance
in
that
subject
matter
to
the
analytical
essays
I
had
to
write
as
an
English
major.
In
fact,
I
remember
thinking
that
the
only
remotely
similar
essay
I
had
written
was
the
literacy
narrative
I
had
completed
for
my
first
WA
training
session.
At
the
time,
I
was
under
the
never-voiced
but
still
present
impression
that
my
writing
was
necessarily
different
from
those
of
the
first-years
with
whom
I
conferenced;
I
was
older,
an
English
major,
a
WA,
and
a
tireless
reviser,
and
as
such
I
believed
that
my
essays
would
not
suffer
from
the
same
kinds
of
ailments
as
the
those
of
a
class
of
first-years,
the
majority
of
whom
told
me
in
our
first
conference
that
they
did
not
put
much
time
in
their
writing
and
did
not
think
they
had
much
skill
at
it.
As
I
went
through
the
first
round
of
rough
drafts,
readingiawhich
I
had
always
considered
the
great
improver
of
my
writing
awarenessiaactually
reinforced
my
misperception
that
my
writing
was
too
far
removed
from
my
peersu
writing.
As
we
discussed
in
some
of
earliest
WA
conferences
last
year,
while
grammatical
errors
are
not
the
province
of
the
WA,
they
still
seem
to
stand
out
toiaand
often
greatly
aggravateiaus.
For
my
part,
my
long-time
grammar
stickler
tendencies
were
coming
under
fire
as
I
studied
the
politics
of
language
use
in
one
of
my
own
classes,
but
I
was
still
attached
to
certain
assumptions
about
languageianamely,
that
rbads
surface
readability
meant
bad
writing.
The
first
drafts
that
I
was
reading
for
my
first
round
of
conferences
were
largely
unfinished,
unorganized,
and
without
any
analytical
component.
As
conferences
would
reveal,
the
state
of
the
drafts
may
have
been
the
result
of
miscommunication
between
the
students
and
their
professor,
but
at
the
time,
I
saw
the
run-on
sentences
and
unfinished
ideas
as
an
indication
of
a
different
class
of
writing.
Armed
with
a
cursory
understanding
of
the
topics
we
discussed
at
our
WA
meetings,
I
decided,
possibly
subconsciously,
that
this
was
reader-based
prose.
Because
I
never
doubted
that
my
own
writing
was
writer-based,
I
decided
that
my
writing
and
the
majority
of
my
peersu
writing
had
different
problems,
and
had
different
goal
states
to
revise
toward.
Looking
back,
it
is
unsurprising
that
the
first
time
I
can
recall
feeling
a
solid
connection
between
what
I
wrote
as
a
student
and
what
I
read
as
a
WA
occurred
when
I
had
an
assignment
that
almost
directly
paralleled
one
completed
by
my
first
WA
class.
For
their
final
paper,
the
FYS
class
had
to
incorporate
their
previously-written
learning
narrative
into
a
longer
research
paper
they
had
been
working
on;
they
did
not
know
at
the
time
they
wrote
either
paper
that
they
would
have
to
combine
the
essays.
The
memory
of
watching
some
of
the
anxious
first-years
actually
begin
pulling
on
their
hair
in
the
writing
lab
as
they
struggled
with
how
to
make
apples
and
oranges
into
one
coherent
whole
came
rushing
back
to
me
at
the
end
of
second
semester
last
year,
when
I
found
myself
in
a
remarkably
similar
position
in
front
of
the
library
computers.
Several
days
before
May
finals
week,
I
realized
that,
due
to
my
own
misunderstanding
of
the
assignment,
the
three
essays
that
I
thought
I
was
turning
in
actually
had
to
be
combined
into
one
long
essay
with
one
controlling
idea.
For
the
first
time
since
I
had
joined
the
WA
staff,
I
had
to
draw
on
advice
that
I
had
crafted
for
the
students
I
worked
with.
That
advice
I
had
crafted
for
the
FYS
students
in
conferences
came
from
necessity,
rather
than
experience.
Digging
for
connections
between
seemingly
disparate
sources
had
been
one
of
the
major
challenges
my
first
semester
WA
students,
and
many
came
to
their
last
conferences
with
no
drafts
whatsoever,
only
blank
looks
and
a
vague
plan
that
they
were
going
to
rewrite
both
papers
on
similar
topics
and
then
combine
those
new
papers.
In
weighing
the
order
of
concerns
as
I
read
the
drafts,
I
decided
that
the
lack
of
any
unifying
idea
was
the
major
obstacle
to
the
essaysu
intelligibility.
I
assumed
that
once
that
connecting
thread
was
found,
the
students
would
be
able
to
write
the
individual
sections
of
their
paper,
using
that
thread
as
a
point
of
focus.
Drawing
on
my
readerus
sensibility,
which,
as
I
said
in
last
yearus
essay,
has
been
the
major
catalyst
in
my
development
as
a
writer,
I
prompted
the
students
to
read
their
papers
as
they
would
a
novel
for
class,
and
asked
them
to
distill
each
section
they
had
written
to
its
most
basic
theme,
and
then
find
how
these
themes
related
to
each
other.
Being
that
that
usually
took
up
all
30
minutes
of
our
conference,
I
suggested
to
them
that
they
revise
each
of
the
sections
they
had
already
written,
keeping
that
unifying
relation
between
themes
as
the
center
of
each.
I
was
fortunate
that
when
I
came
down
to
the
wire
on
my
own
final
paper
a
semester
later,
I
had
already
brainstormed
a
way
to
work
toward
readable
unity.
The
experience
was
handy
in
that
the
advice
got
me
out
of
a
tight
and
incredibly
frustrating
spot
as
a
student,
but
I
canut
help
but
think
that
I
would
have
come
to
the
same
method
of
creating
a
coherent
essay
even
if
I
had
not
shared
the
experience
with
20
FYS
students.
After
all,
the
advice
that
I
gave
the
students
was
not
a
divine
inspiration
that
falls
into
the
minds
of
WAs
only;
it
was
the
result
of
scrutinizing
what
I
as
a
writer
expect
from
writing.
Certainly,
having
already
done
the
legwork
made
writing
my
own
paper
a
faster
process,
but
I
think
the
greater
benefit
of
the
situation
was
not
one
that
pertained
to
the
scope
of
just
that
paper
or
that
class.
In
terms
of
building
compassioniathe
crucial
addition
which
makes
WAs
more
than
simple
editors,
in
my
opinioniathe
experience
was
invaluable.
Sitting
in
the
Skillman
Libraryus
main
computer
lab
with
three
different
documents
open,
pages
of
text
on
the
clipboard,
and
no
clear
idea
of
what
I
was
trying
to
say,
I
couldnut
help
but
think
back
favorably
on
those
students
who
had
told
me
in
December
that
they
were
going
to
knowingly
ignore
their
professorus
instructions
just
to
be
done
with
their
uncertainty
over
how
to
proceed.
Of
course,
seeing
that
the
most
difficult
course
I
had
ever
taken
presented
the
same
challenges
as
an
FYS
also
helped
to
demolish
more
of
my
unspoken
haughtiness
over
the
complexity
of
my
own
classes
and
responsibilities.
It
also
didnut
hurt
to
see
that
my
inner
reader
sensibility
wasnut
entirely
on
the
wrong
path;
the
advice
that
I
had
generated
for
the
students
I
worked
with
had
survived
my
own
personal
testing,
and
had
enabled
me
to
produce
an
essay
that,
after
days
of
tweaking,
left
me
satisfied
as
a
reader.
I
think
the
greatest
benefit,
however,
was
the
way
sharing
this
strife
with
the
FYS
class
pushed
me
to
explore
what
exactly
reader
satisfaction
entails.
The
experience
was
a
milestone
for
me
because
it
was
the
first
time
one
of
my
own
papers
had
the
very
same
challenges
to
readability
as
the
papers
of
the
students
I
worked
with
did.
It
was
the
first
time
I
remember
being
aware
of
Rachel-the-WAus
reading
standards
at
the
same
time
I
was
acting
as
Rachel-the-student.
Of
course,
I
had
applied
Rachel-the-WAus
judgment
to
my
own
writing
many
times
previous,
even
back
when
she
was
still
Rachel-the-future-WA.
The
basic
strictures
that
I
enforced
in
my
own
papers
made
the
basis
of
my
WA
counseliaintroduce
the
controlling
idea
early,
make
sure
every
argument
has
a
place
in
that
idea,
keep
it
to
one
idea
per
paragraph
(courtesy
of
my
first
WA
as
she
no
doubt
tired
of
reading
my
marathon
blocks
of
text),
keep
poking
around
for
a
deeper
rwhysiabut
I
had
never
before
given
the
same
specific
advice
in
front
of
my
own
laptop
as
I
had
in
Pardee
319.
In
the
majority
of
papers
I
had
encountered
my
first
semester
as
a
WAiaall
of
which
I
assumed
to
be
relatively
polished,
late-stage
efforts,
I
was
dealing
with
macroscopic
rhigher
order
concerns.s
I
was
talking
to
writers
who
did
not
articulate
that
they
knew
what
they
were
trying
to
say,
or
even
that
they
knew
what
an
appropriate
range
of
things
to
say
would
be.
Working
with
essays
that
were
in
such
an
unfinished
form
did
not
jolt
any
reminders
of
working
with
my
own
writing.
I
imagined
that
the
papers
of
my
FYS
students
were
disorganized
late-stage
drafts,
and
the
things
that
I
as
a
reader
expect
to
see
in
my
own
late-stage
draftsiaa
controlling
idea
built
up
by
surrounding
arguments
which
need
to
be
tailored
until
they
all
pull
their
weight
in
supporting
another
aspect
of
that
controlling
ideaiawere
simply
not
present
in
the
FYS
studentsu
papers.
It
wasnut
until
I
found
myself
with
early
stage
drafts
so
similar
to
what
those
students
had
shown
me
earlier
that
I
recognized
the
FYS
papers
I
had
read
for
what
they
were:
prewriting.
Because
I
knew
what
I
as
a
reader
had
demanded
of
the
FYS
studentsu
writing
in
its
earliest
stages,
and
because
I
was
about
to
apply
those
demands
to
my
own
writing,
I
was
presented
with
a
chance
to
see
how
those
demands
varied
when
I
was
conferencing
with
myself.
For
some
reason,
Ium
not
surprised
that
my
inner
reader
was
much
more
demanding
of
my
own
writing
than
that
of
the
FYS
students.
Places
in
studentsu
papers
where
a
point
just
fit
into
the
overall
but
just
barely
I
would
let
go,
but
in
my
own
paper,
I
would
alternately
revise
and
scrap
until
it
was
tight
enough
to
hold
water.
I
noticed
the
same
trend
on
another
of
my
final
papersiaan
essay
that
had
exceeded
the
professorus
page
limit
and
needed
to
be
cut
down
to
size.
I
was
reminded
while
cutting
that
paper
of
an
assignment
my
second
semester
WA
class
had
in
which
they
had
to
write
a
ten-page
persuasive
paper
and
then
cut
it
down
to
a
two-page
letter.
Again,
while
I
followed
the
same
general
advice
as
I
had
given
the
students
I
worked
with
(borrowing
heavily
from
the
brevity
lessons
that
taking
a
journalistic
writing
class
had
forced
on
me),
but
I
took
it
to
a
finer
level
in
my
own
work,
slashing
not
just
sections
of
text,
but
subpoints
and
running
threads.
When
this
realization
hit
me
at
the
end
of
last
semester,
I
had
to
grapple
with
the
possible
reasons
why
I
demand
so
much
of
my
own
work.
Part
of
the
reason
might
be
as
basic
as
the
amount
of
time
I
had
to
work
with
each
essay.
Many
of
my
final
conferences
with
my
students
ran
on
toward
40
minutes,
but
as
long
as
a
given
conference
ran,
once
that
student
walked
out
of
the
writing
lab,
their
paper
was
no
longer
a
challenge
for
me
to
work
through.
The
advice
and
expectations
that
I
gave
for
them
needed
to
be
somewhat
grosser,
because
of
the
limited
time
we
had
to
work
together.
When
I
worked
on
my
own
paper,
however,
there
was
nothing
to
stop
me
from
closing
the
library
down
every
night
except
my
desire
to
get
some
sleep.
More
importantly,
though,
I
think
I
as
a
reader
demanded
a
more
tightly-knit,
carefully-reasoned,
hole-free
effect
from
my
own
essays
than
I
did
from
the
essays
of
the
students
I
worked
with
because
I
expect
more
from
the
genre
I
was
writing
in
than
I
do
the
FYS
genre.
Although
I
had
known
it
on
some
level
all
along,
the
experience
forced
me
to
confront
the
fact
that
for
better
or
worse,
my
internal
reader
expects
a
certain
level
of
writing
for
an
introductory
college
class:
well-reasoned,
yes,
and
competently
worded
with
an
attempt
to
dig
below
the
surface
of
things,
but
imperfect.
On
the
other
hand,
it
expects
publishable
work
to
come
out
of
an
upper-level
class,
like
the
one
I
was
writing
my
essay
for.
The
realization
reminded
me
of
the
old
annoyance
with
cut-and-dry
essay
prompts
that
I
documented
in
my
first
literacy
narrative.
As
a
writer
who
is
so
motivated
by
how
my
work
sounds
when
read,
I
have
consistently
had
trouble
bringing
essays
on
topics
that
I
do
not
have
much
of
a
readerus
feel
for
up
to
par.
Because
I
have
taken
on
a
science
major
in
the
last
year
in
addition
to
my
English
major,
the
number
of
non-analytical
essay
pieces
I
am
writing
is
increasing,
which
makes
this
particular
writing
hang-up
problematic.
However,
seeing
how
my
reading
standards
differed
between
two
papers
whose
major
difference
was
the
class
they
were
written
for
helped
me
to
see
how
important
not
only
my
familiarity
with
a
genre,
but
also
my
expectations
of
that
genre
are
to
the
quality
of
my
writing.
By
extension,
it
showed
me
how
differences
in
those
expectations
leave
some
of
my
essaysiaparticularly
those
that
donut
address
traditionally
literary
topicsia
vulnerable.
Because
the
quality
of
my
writing
is
so
tied
to
how
thorough
my
internal
reader
is,
essays
for
subjects
that
I
donut
think
require
much
sophistication
wind
up
with
a
more
permissive
reader
who
lets
logical
holes
go
as
long
as
they
donut
interfere
with
the
overall
flow
of
the
argument
too
greatly.
The
lesson
was
one
that
applied
to
the
last
of
my
final
essays
last
semesteriaone
for
my
VAST
class,
which
I
otherwise
would
have
left
as
adequate
but
not
far-reaching.
Honing
my
inner
reader
by
working
as
a
WA
this
year
has
improved
me
as
a
writer
because
I
have
developed
an
awareness
of
the
deficiencies
of
my
seemingly
fool-proof
readability
standard.
Because
I
have
to
approach
my
work
now
with
the
knowledge
that
my
inner
reader
is
less
than
constant,
I
try
to
be
more
vigilant
and
more
conscious
of
how
I
am
evaluating
what
Iuve
written
when
I
re-read
it.
Over
the
next
year,
my
goal
is
to
take
my
realizations
a
step
further,
and
investigate
why
my
reading
standards
vary.
I
hope
that
in
uncovering
this
information,
I
can
look
for
ways
to
alter
my
standards
so
that
I
demand
the
highest
level
of
all
the
work
I
read,
whether
in
WA
conferences
or
in
front
of
my
own
computer.
