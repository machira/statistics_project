My
Growth
as
a
Writer
While
I
cannot
claim
an
infallible
memory,
I
can
honestly
say
that
I
have
been
a
writer
for
as
long
as
I
can
remember.
My
memories
begin
around
age
three,
and
so
span
most
all
of
my
life.
Many
of
my
memories
are
incredibly
vivid,
and
among
the
most
vivid
are
my
experiences
with
language.
Looking
back,
I
realized
that
rooted
in
my
earliest
memories
is
the
beginning
of
what
has
become
a
lifelong
love
for
words.
My
early
childhood
years
were
ones
of
bliss
and
discovery.
The
world
was
large
and
I
was
small
so
that
everywhere
I
turned
there
was
something
new,
something
unexplored.
In
my
daily
investigation
and
play
I
rapidly
augmented
my
vocabulary
and,
in
turn,
strengthened
my
ability
to
communicate
increasingly
complex
ideas.
Still,
my
language
mastery
was
limited
at
best
and
I
often
struggled
to
convey
my
questions
to
adults,
which
exasperated
me
to
no
end.
I
remember
asking
my
grandmother
why
the
top
portion
of
her
windshield
was
tinted
blue
while
riding
in
her
car
one
afternoon.
She
misunderstood
me
and
went
on
to
explain
why
the
sky
is
blue.
I
was
indeed
confused
since
her
explanation
did
not
seem
to
answer
my
question
at
all.
Now
that
I
think
back,
these
miscommunications
were
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception.
As
a
result
of
these
frustrations,
I
soon
realized
that
if
I
was
to
find
the
answers
I
sought
I
would
have
to
master
the
English
language.
I
have
loved
books
perhaps
longer
than
I
have
been
a
writer.
My
mother
read
to
me
often,
beginning
when
I
was
very
young.
At
three
years
my
favorite
book
was
a
compilation
that
included
The
Three
Little
Pigs,
Goldv-Locks
and
the
Three
Bears,
and
The
Kittens
Who
Lost
Their
Mittens.
After
a
time,
I
knew
the
stories
in
my
books
so
well
that
I
was
able
to
recite
them
and
turn
the
pages
at
the
appropriate
time
so
that
it
might
have
appeared
to
an
observer
that
I
was
reading
them.
What
I
wanted,
more
than
anything,
was
to
be
able
to
read
and
I
thought
that
this
form
of
recital
was
the
next
best
thing.
I
soon
grew
tired
of
this
act
however,
and
began
to
elaborate
on
the
stories.
With
my
stuffed
animals
gathered
around,
me
as
an
attentive
audience,
I
would
create
new
versions
of
my
favorite
stories.
I
was
taking
the
first
steps
toward
writing,
though
I
could
not
yet
control
a
pen
or
pencil,
I
was
learning
to
use
words
to
harness
and
shape
my
limitless
imagination.
I
soon
grew
tired
of
the
restrictive
template
an
already
written
book
presented
for
a
young
writer,
and
so
I
began
to
"write"
my
own
books.
Though
very
simple,
these
early
writings
were
logically
developed
with
a
beginning
and
an
end.
I
myself
could
not
yet
write
so
I
would
first
draw
all
the
appropriate
pictures
and
invent
the
story.
Next,
I
would
instruct
my
mother
of
what
words
I
wanted
her
to
write
on
each
page.
The
finished
product
was
a
story
book
that
she
could
read
to
me
over
and
over,
and
which
I
knew
by
heart.
I
took
great
pride
in
my
stories,
even
then
I
seemed
to
sense
something
magical
in
writing.
As
I
produced
more
and
more
of
these
little
Yahna
stories
I
began
to
grow
anxious
to
learn
to
write
words
myself,
so
at
age
four
I
began
to
learn
the
alphabet.
It
was
not
long
before
I
had
mastered
singing
the
alphabet,
but
it
would
take
considerable
time
for
me
to
become
adept
at
writing
the
characters
that
produced
these
sounds.
My
mother
was
my
patient
teacher
and
she
would
sit
with
me
at
the
kitchen
table
and
show
me
what
the
various
letters
looked
like.
With
green
and
blue
crayons
she
would
write
my
name
and
I
would
take
my
turn
trying
to
reproduce
it
beneath
hers.
As
a
result
of
these
sessions
I
learned
to
write
my
alphabet.
I
knew
that
these
letters
were
used
to
write
words
but
I
had
no
understanding
of
how
they
were
combined
to
produce
them.
That,
however,
did
not
stop
me
from
writing
stories
with
them.
I
would
sit
at
the
table,
crayon
in
hand,
and
write
story
after
story
composed
of
random
letters.
It
would
be
some
time
before
my
stories
were
readable
by
others,
but
these
early
attempts
pleased
me
very
much.
It
was
in
kindergarten
that
I
really
learned
to
read
and
write.
My
classmates
and
I
spent
considerable
time
practicing
pairing
the
letters
with
their
corresponding
sounds
and
then
began
to
learn
to
sound
out
words
to
read
simple
sentences.
I
remember
how
proud
I
was
when
I
was
able
to
read
stories
to
my
mom
at
bedtime.
She
helped
me
to
sound
out
unfamiliar
words,
and
my
sight
reading
vocabulary
grew
by
leaps
and
bounds.
At
the
same
time,
I
was
learning
to
write
words
and
my
little
stories
began
to
grow
more
legible
to
others.
I
continued
to
develop
my
reading
and
writing
abilities
in
the
early
years
of
elementary
school.
I
increased
my
vocabulary
in
spelling
class
and
learned
the
mechanics
of
language
in
English
class.
My
favorite
assignments
were
always
writing
exercises,
which
were
quite
frequent
in
elementary
school.
These
prompted
sessions
gave
me
a
chance
to
express
myself
creatively,
and
also
to
share
my
writing
with
others.
I
loved
to
produce
stories,
and
I
sought
praise
from
my
teachers
for
my
writing.
I
also
loved
playing
with
words
and
their
meanings
in
my
writing.
I
remember
feeling
very
crafty
when
on
an
Easter
prompt,
in
second
grade,
I
wrote
about
how
the
Easter
bunny
harvests
his
Easter
eggs
from
a
garden
of
eggplants
(most
clever
don't
you
agree?).
In
junior
high
school
my
curriculum
changed
drastically
when
my
class
became
the
first
to
use
a
newly
developed
writing
intensive
English
program.
Under
this
new
system,
grammar
lessons
were
abandoned
and
replaced
with
in-class
writing,
editing,
publishing,
reading,
and
journal
keeping.
Each
student
was
required
to
keep
a
portfolio
of
their
writing,
including
all
rough
drafts
and
finished
pieces,
and
to
produce
five
published
pieces
per
school
quarter.
Some
assignments
were
structured,
for
example
we
might
be
instructed
to
produce
one
persuasive
essay
and
one
informative
essay,
others
were
open
to
the
imagination.
As
a
result
of
this
writing
curriculum,
my
classmates
and
I
exposure
to
many
forms
of
writing,
everything
from
persuasive
speeches
to
poems.
I
also
gained
ample
practice
as
a
peer
editor.
Each
published
piece
was
the
result
of
at
least
two
rough
drafts,
which
were
each
required
to
be
edited
by
two
persons
(not
including
yourself).
Indeed,
one
of
the
most
wonderful
aspects
of
this
system
was
the
opportunity
it
gave
us
to
share
our
writing
with
others.
Our
writing
was
viewed
by
peers
at
various
stages
during
editing,
but
each
piece
was
also
required
to
be
published
in
some
way
that
allowed
it
to
be
heard
or
viewed
by
the
whole
class.
Finished
pieces
could
be
published
in
many
ways.
Many
students
staked
out
a
special
spot
in
the
classroom
which
they
decorated
and
hung
their
finished
writing.
As
a
result
there
was
writing
literally
everywhere:
on
the
walls,
on
the
desks
and
blackboards,
and
even
on
the
ceiling
tiles.
While
I
displayed
my
writing
in
the
classroom
I
also
elected
more
creative
ways
to
publish
my
pieces.
I
wrote
a
number
of
short
skits
and
plays
which
I
and
my
friends
performed
for
the
class,
and
entered
speech
competitions
with
my
writing.
My
two
years
in
junior
high
school
greatly
strengthened
my
love
for
writing.
Not
only
did
they
provide
me
with
the
flexibility
to
explore
my
creative
potential,
but
they
also
provided
me
with
considerable
feedback
and
confidence.
When
I
advanced
to
high
school,
the
English
curriculum
remained
writing
intensive
but
became
much
more
structured.
More
time
was
spent
covering
literary
classics
and
preparing
for
the
SAT's
by
drilling
vocabulary.
Writing
assignments
were
frequent
but
much
more
specific
in
their
requirements
than
those
of
junior
high
school.
While
I
enjoyed
English
class
and
excelled
in
it,
it
was
at
this
time
that
I
began
to
seek
new
outlets
to
develop
my
writing.
My
freshman
year
of
high
school
I
joined
a
group
of
students
who
were
working
to
form
a
writer's
club.
Along
with
an
advisory
teacher,
we
met
as
a
group
each
Wednesday
after
school.
These
sessions
were
used
any
way
we
wanted.
Often
we
would
share
personal
writing,
such
as
poetry,
and
ask
the
group
for
feedback.
Other
times
we
conducted
free-writing
exercises
during
which
we
might
listen
to
a
record
and
write
what
it
inspired
in
us,
or
perhaps
write
an
end
to
a
story
the
teacher
began.
These
meetings
were
always
productive
and
always
enjoyable.
There
was
a
great
deal
of
camaraderie
among
the
members
and
I
always
felt
safe
sharing
my
writing
with
them.
I
remained
in
the
group
throughout
high
school
and
I
feel
that
my
writing
profited
greatly.
In
addition
to
the
writing
club
I
also
developed
my
writing
as
a
member
of
the
school
newspaper
staff.
I
worked
on
the
staff
as
both
an
editor
and
a
writer,
which
further
strengthened
my
writing.
All
in
all,
I
feel
that
I
was
very
well
prepared
for
writing
in
college.
My
English
education
in
junior
high
and
high
school
gave
me
a
solid
foundation
as
a
writer,
and
instilled
in
me
writing
and
editing
skills
that
I
continue
to
use
today.
I
had
exposure
to
most
all
forms
of
writing
including
MLA
research
papers
that
are
the
standard
in
college
courses.
One
shortcoming
of
my
pre-college
writing
education,
however,
was
its
lack
of
English
grammar
emphasis.
Though
my
writing
advanced
greatly
and
I
learned
grammatical
and
structural
rules
indirectly,
I
never
mastered
the
vocabulary
of
sentence
structure.
I
still
cannot
tell
you
what
a
participle
or
a
past-participle
is.
Oddly
enough,
this
has
proved
to
be
a
greater
weakness
when
learning
a
foreign
language
than
when
writing
a
college
paper.
The
greatest
difference,
I
found,
between
high
school
and
college
writing
was
the
sheer
volume
required
and
also
the
lack
of
intermediate
feedback.
When
I
received
my
first
writing
assignment
for
my
FYS
course
I
was
bothered
by
the
fact
that
the
paper
requirements
were
so
vague
and
also
by
the
fact
that
the
professor
would
not
see
it
until
I
submitted
the
final
draft.
While
I
was
able
to
research
my
topic
and
produce
what
I
though
to
be
a
suitable
draft,
I
felt
concerned
that
my
understanding
of
the
assignment
might
not
match
the
professors.
In
high
school
I
was
accustomed
to
having
teachers
read
my
drafts
and
giving
me
immediate
feedback.
This
new
system
seemed
scary
and
unsettling.
Here,
my
WA
helped
me
greatly.
My
first
meeting
with
a
WA
greatly
reassured
me
that
I
was
on
the
right
track.
He
helped
me
to
iron
out
some
unclear
transitions
and
listened
to
my
concerns.
I
was
a
little
surprised
because
I
had
expected
my
WA
to
serve
simply
as
a
grammatical
editor.
He
did
very
little
grammatical
editing
of
my
paper,
but
instead
focused
on
its
ideas.
I
left
that
first
WA
conference
with
a
clear
direction
of
where
I
wanted
to
take
my
paper
and
a
sense
of
relief
that
it
was
not
a
total
failure.
I
did
well
enough
in
my
FYS
that
I
was
dismissed
from
taking
the
college
writing
course
the
following
semester.
I
have
done
well
in
all
my
writing
courses
here
at
Lafayette,
be
it
a
psychology
lab
or
an
English
literature
course.
I
have
also
continued
to
free-write
and
work
on
poetry
in
my
spare
time
as
I
have
done
since
junior
high.
Despite
these
successes
with
college
writing
I
have
felt
the
need
for
supplementary
outlets
in
order
to
reach
my
greatest
potential
as
a
writer.
It
was
for
this
reason
that
last
semester
I
decided
to
apply
for
a
WA
position
here
at
the
college.
I
am
both
excited
and
nervous
about
my
new
position
as
a
WA.
I
am
thrilled
because
I
know
what
a
wonderful
opportunity
this
is
to
grow
as
a
writer
and
a
person.
I
really
look
forward
to
working
cooperatively
with
my
fellow
students
to
improve
their
writing
as
well
as
my
own.
I
know
that
these
new
freshman,
who
I
will
work
with
this
coming
semester,
will
have
many
of
the
same
concerns
and
fears
that
I
did
when
I
began
writing
here
at
Lafayette.
I
look
forward
to
helping
them
through
their
first
papers
as
my
WA
did
with
me.
They
will
also
have
insights
and
questions
about
writing
that
I
have
never
yet
considered
and
so
it
will
be
a
chance
to
see
writing
in
a
new
light.
At
the
same
time
I
have
worried
that
I
may
not
be
adequately
prepared
to
answer
all
of
their
questions
and
concerns.
I
hope
that
the
training
session
will
help
resolve
these
fears!
Looking
back,
for
the
first
time,
at
my
growth
as
a
writer
as
this
assignment
asked
me
to,
I
have
realized
what
an
important
role
writing
has
played
in
my
life.
This
shifts
my
gaze
to
the
future
and
I
look
forward
to
the
new
paths
my
writing
will
take
as
my
career
advances.
While
I
can't
claim
to
know
the
future,
I
can
say
that
I
will
be
a
writer
all
of
my
life.
