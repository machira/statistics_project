Writing
Associate
paper
8/20/99
"Honey,
she's
using
the
BLACK
crayon
again!"
With
this
worried
expression
that
seeped
from
my
mother's
mouth,
my
introduction
to
the
world
of
literary
materials
can
be
neatly
encapsulated.
Even
though
I
have
no
direct
recollection
of
my
exclusive
use
of
"the
black
crayon"
to
draw
and
possibly
crudely
imitate
writing
in
my
earliest
years,
I
am
thankful
that
I
have
developed
the
ability
to
broaden
my
use
of
writing
materials
as
well
as
endeavors
over
the
course
of
time.
Since
I
began
writing,
paper
and
ink,
computers,
and
my
mind's
own
slate
have
all
been
invaluable
writing
tools
that
have
enabled
me
to
compose
a
myriad
of
writing
genres
including
plays,
poetiy,
journal
entries,
paragraphs
in
a
variety
of
flavors,
short
stories,
longer
fictitious
works,
and
traditional
research
papers.
I
have
a
medley
of
past
experiences
to
guide
me,
all
of
which
have
served
not
only
to
teach
me
lessons
about
writing,
but
lessons
about
life
as
well.
When
I
was
still
young,
I
began
to
view
writing
as
a
squirrel
may
view
a
bird
feeder.
It
takes
some
work
to
get
the
food
and
it
certainly
proves
to
be
a
challenge
more
often
than
not,
but
the
end
result
is
worth
it,
and
if
one
wants
it
badly
enough,
one
will
strive
to
conquer
all
obstacles.
Because
of
this,
writing
has
always
been
something
that
allows
me
to
stretch
and
test
my
abilities
and
limitations,
and
it
has
usually
been
extremely
enjoyable
for
me
as
well,
at
times
possibly
even
like
a
game.
Second
grade
holds
my
first
pleasant
recollection
of
my
attempt
at
artistry
through
letters.
It
is
a
very
enjoyable
memory
formed
from
remembrances
of
composing
and
reveling
in
two
stories
about
how
my
friend
Becky's
life
and
my
own
life
would
be
when
we
were
"grown
up"
teenagers.
We
wrote
our
masterpieces
together,
specifically
detailing
who
our
husbands
would
be
(I
still
can't
believe
we
thought
about
things
like
that
when
we
were
only
8
but
the
stories
prove
it
so!),
and
even
what
our
wedding
cakes
would
be
like.
However,
these
stories
were
not
written
as
an
assignment
or
for
some
other
obligation,
but
purely
for
enjoyment
purposes.
They
were
something
that
we
had
set
our
minds
on
accomplishing,
and
we
were
not
about
to
fall
short
of
our
challenge
to
ourselves.
Because
of
this
attitude,
my
first
writing
memory
is
one
that
ends
in
feelings
of
achievement
and
fulfillment,
and
this
has
been
something
that
I
have
been
able
to
carry
with
me
and
apply
to
other
writing
adventures
as
well.
Another
vivid
memory
of
a
personal
writing
challenge
pertains
to
when
each
person
in
our
fifth
grade
class
was
asked
to
write
and
act
out
a
play
with
a
fellow
student.
My
friend
Lisa
and
I
chose
to
work
together
(mistake
one),
and
after
much
deliberation
concluded
that
our
play
would
be
entitled
"The
Frog
That
Ate
St.
Louis"
(mistake
two).
Even
though
our
narratives
were
well
written,
and
the
play
turned
out
to
be
a
success,
I
did
not
come
away
with
as
great
a
feeling
of
success
or
fulfillment
as
I
had
when
I
worked
with
Becky
on
our
stories.
I
feel
as
though
this
may
be
because
I
needed
the
bittersweet
feeling
I
was
left
with
which
served
to
show
me
that
even
though
we
got
what
we
needed
to
do
accomplished,
the
play
would
have
been
far
better
if
more
writing
and
less
gossiping,
blabbing,
and
giggling
had
been
done.
In
retrospect
however,
this
experience
was
invaluable
in
teaching
me
that
while
writing
is
on
all
occasions
supposed
to
be
enjoyable,
it
must
on
all
occasions
be
viewed
as
a
responsibility
as
well
as
a
game.
Because
of
this
realization,
I
am
now
more
adept
at
intermingling
these
two
concepts
while
I
write.
It
was
also
around
this
period
in
my
life
when
I
was
given
the
opportunity
to
write
my
first
extended
work.
Our
gifted
enrichment
teacher,
Mr.
Kirk,
challenged
us
to
compose
a
story
about
a
tree
and
what
if
would
eventually
become
in
the
manufacturing
world.
I
chose
to
write
mine
about
the
development
of
a
tree
into
the
Declaration
of
Independence,
and
upon
completion,
this
piece
proved
to
be
my
longest
composition
at
the
time,
comprised
of
about
15
pages.
I
was
extremely
proud
of
this
"masterful"
(to
my
young
mind)
literary
work
done
by
my
own
hands--so
proud
in
fact
that
I
wrote
to
Reader's
Digest
in
1991
and
attempted
to
get
it
published.
A
hearty
rejection
didn't
slow
me
down
however,
and
I
continued
onward
in
my
writing
endeavors.
Once
again,
in
retrospect
I
learned
that
in
addition
to
enjoyment
and
a
sense
of
responsibility,
one
must
also
bring
a
sense
of
hope
and
faith
to
one's
writing.
The
only
way
that
I
would
have
had
a
chance
to
get
my
story
published
was
if
I
chose
to
send
it
away
and
actually
try
to
get
it
published.
This
may
sound
trite,
but
to
be
able
to
do
that,
I
needed
to
have
faith
in
myself
and
my
ability
to
write.
Sixth
grade
brought
about
two
new
literary
turn
of
events--my
introduction
to
quotations
as
well
as
my
introduction
to
the
"research
paper."
To
begin,
Mrs.
Sweigart,
my
6th
grade
teacher,
had
a
fascination
and
a
deep
love
for
quotations.
At
the
beginning
of
the
school
year,
she
saw
to
it
that
each
of
her
pupils
had
a
fresh
composition
book
set
aside
strictly
for
the
collection
of
quotations,
and
we
were
promptly
instructed
that
there
would
be
a
quote
on
the
side
board
for
us
to
contemplate
and
copy
into
our
notebooks
each
day.
Granted,
this
was
not
an
original
writing
experience,
but
I
feel
compelled
to
mention
this
event
solely
because
it
opened
an
entirely
new
literary
world
for
me,
and
I
now
use
quotations
to
implement
my
writing
as
often
as
I
am
able.
Finally,
it
was
also
at
this
time
that
the
words
"research
paper"
began
to
be
household
terms
for
my
family.
When
my
teacher
uttered
those
two
dreaded
words,
I'm
sure
a
not-so-subtle
gasp
must
have
emanated
from
the
room
as
the
air
filled
with
the
thickness
of
panic
that
only
a
class
of
overwhelmed
6th
graders
can
muster.
The
next
few
weeks
were
filled
with
frustration,
confusion,
and
finally,
wild
excitement
when
I
had
finally
produced
a
research
paper
on
"The
Titanic"
of
which
I
was
proud.
However,
this
challenge
to
produce
my
first
lengthy
non-fiction
work
served
as
a
necessary
discipline
that
allowed
me
to
learn
the
"ins
and
outs"
of
staying
focused
and
on
task
for
a
project
requiring
many
steps
to
reach
completion.
The
next
important
writing
experience
that
sticks
in
the
recesses
of
my
mind
carries
with
it
memories
of
7th
grade.
It
is
at
this
time
that
I
was
taught
about
writing
without
a
specific
goal,
but
I
did
not
realize
that
this
may
have
been
the
lesson
until
I
stopped
just
now
to
think
about
it.
At
the
beginning
of
several
of
our
English
classes
throughout
the
year,
Miss
Smith
would
instruct
us
to
take
out
a
half
sheet
of
notebook
paper
and
compose
the
longest
sentence
that
we
could
create.
A
time
limit
was
announced,
and
then
we
were
off.
Unfortunately,
I
think
I
mistook
the
purpose
of
this
exercise.
Instead
of
using
it
as
a
time
for
writing
merely
for
enjoyment
and
as
a
chance
to
jumpstart
the
mind,
I
chose
to
make
it
into
a
contest
against
my
other
classmates
that
I
told
myself
I
must
win.
Because
of
this,
I
think
that
much
of
the
value
of
the
experience
was
lost
to
me
since
I
was
always
focused
on
beating
everyone
else,
not
really
taking
in
the
true
purpose
of
the
exercise.
However,
with
the
use
of20/20
hindsight,
I
have
seen
that
not
all
writing
must
be
an
extreme
challenge
and
that
one
can
also
write
merely
for
enjoyment
and
relaxation.
Very
fortunately,
my
many
failures
are
just
as
able
to
lead
to
the
conception
of
learning
experiences
as
are
my
successes.
Time
continued,
and
eighth
grade
proved
to
be
a
troubling
as
well
as
rewarding
period
in
my
life
in
terms
of
writing.
To
begin,
my
friend
Kelly
was
dabbling
with
ideas
of
becoming
an
artist
at
this
time,
and
she
had
been
spending
much
time
perfecting
her
techniques,
while
I
had
been
composing
original
poetry
as
a
hobby
for
quite
some
time
as
well.
We
thus
decided
to
combine
our
talents
to
produce
a
book
of
illustrated
poetry
that
we
hoped
would
be
published
someday.
Therefore,
one
October
night
we
gathered
up
our
materials
and
sat
down
to
work,
both
with
high
expectations
that
would
soon
be
crushed.
I
had
never
before
this
point
stopped
to
realize
that
someone
might
not
like
my
poetry,
and
I
suppose
that
I
had
simply
assumed
that
if
I
liked
it,
then
so
would
everyone
else.
I
quickly
learned
the
hard
way,
however,
that
this
was
simply
not
the
case.
As
I
began
to
read
Kelly
one
of
my
favorite
poems
so
that
she
would
be
able
to
get
an
idea
of
what
she
wished
to
draw
in
order
for
her
illustration
and
my
writing
to
complement
one
another,
I
was
able
to
clearly
see
that
she
disliked
my
style
of
writing.
She
simply
did
not
enjoy
how
I
wrote.
We
continued
to
illustrate
this
particular
poem
anyway
and
later
tried
to
compose
some
other
works,
but
we
were
unable
to
connect
each
other's
talents.
This
was
the
first
time
that
I
truly
felt
inadequate
as
a
writer,
and
it
certainly
was
a
most
humbling
experience.
It
made
me
evaluate
whether
or
not
my
work
was
good
in
actuality
or
just
in
my
mind's
eye,
but
it
also
allowed
me
to
realize
that
I
didn't
have
to
quit
or
change
how
I
wrote
simply
because
another
person
didn't
enjoy
what
I
produced.
I
only
needed
to
change
if
I
felt
that
it
would
be
beneficial.
Finally,
writing
my
credo
for
confirmation
class
was
one
of
the
best
and
most
exhilarating
writing
experiences
of
my
life,
and
this
also
occurred
in
8th
grade,
serving
as
a
superb
antithesis
to
my
attempt
at
authoring
an
illustrated
poetry
book.
For
this
assignment,
our
pastor
instructed
us
to
write
a
lengthy
exposition
detailing
our
heartfelt
thoughts
about
our
relationship
with
God,
Jesus,
and
the
Holy
Spirit.
When
I
sat
down
outside
in
the
cool
night
air
to
gather
my
thoughts,
the
words
simply
flowed
from
my
pen,
and
I
produced
a
work
that
made
our
teaching
assistant
cry.
However,
I
did
not
set
out
to
produce
the
best
or
the
most
emotional
credo--I
set
out
to
find
what
my
heart
told
me
to
write.
I
had
no
prior
expectations,
and
neither
did
anyone
else.
Yet,
I
was
able
to
produce
a
well-written
work
of
which
I
was
proud,
and
this
experience
not
only
served
to
boost
my
confidence
in
my
work,
but
it
may
have
also
allowed
me
to
learn
the
value
of
being
open
in
sharing
it.
My
16th
year
brought
with
it
an
extremely
tedious
yearlong
project
concerning
the
self-chosen
author
William
Faulkner.
I
had
much
difficulty
extracting
the
messages
he
had
planted
in
many
of
his
novels
and
short
stories,
and
I
had
yet
to
learn
the
time
management
skills
that
correlate
with
the
production
of
a
yearlong
project.
Therefore,
I
was
often
up
quite
late
the
night
before
composing
journal
articles
on
what
I
had
read
during
the
days
prior.
These
two
facts
most
likely
welded
together
to
produce
an
extremely
arduous
writing
experience,
yet
one
that
still
manufactured
an
aura
of
success
upon
completion
because
it
was
the
largest
writing
project
I
had
ever
attempted.
In
the
end,
Mrs.
Stender,
our
English
teacher,
believed
I
had
earned
an
A,
yet
I
now
feel
as
though
this
was
undeserved
because
I
was
aware
of
the
lack
of
preparation
and
understanding
of
what
was
read
that
went
into
bits
and
pieces
of
the
project.
However,
going
through
this
writing
experience
allowed
me
the
opportunity
to
realize
that
total
fulfillment
as
a
writer
comes
not
only
in
acknowledgement
of
the
acceptability
of
a
final
piece
of
writing,
but
also
in
the
knowledge
of
how
one
goes
about
traveling
to
this
final
destination.
As
the
years
aged
and
I
matured,
I
began
to
form
preferences
for
certain
writing
styles,
and
a
fascination
for
poetry
clung
to
me
like
feathers
to
tar.
Ideas
and
beginning
sentences
for
poems
raced
through
my
head
regardless
of
where
I
was;
I
specifically
recall
starting
a
poem
at
work
when
I
was
employed
at
a
railroad
simply
because
an
idea
struck
me
and
needed
to
be
expressed.
During
this
time,
I
also
entered
three
poetry
contests
to
test
my
skill
against
others,
and
I
had
the
joy
of
winning
1st
place
in
one,
becoming
a
semifinalist
in
another,
and
earning
a
publication
spot
in
the
third.
The
success
I
had
earned
made
this
one
of
my
best
writing
experiences
to
date,
but
so
did
the
knowledge
that
I
could
produce
enjoyable
work
for
others
as
well
as
measure
up
to
my
peers.
While
I
pride
myself
in
trying
to
not
need
the
approval
of
others
in
order
to
be
confident
about
what
I
do,
the
knowledge
that
others
beside
myself
enjoy
my
work
is
always
highly
gratifying.
Once
again
in
retrospect,
this
experience
also
greatly
showed
me
more
about
my
attitude
toward
and
confidence
in
my
writing.
I
had
never
really
stopped
to
think
that
I
couldn't
win
when
1
entered
those
contests,
but
I
knew
that
I
wouldn't
be
crushed
if
I
didn't
succeed
in
doing
so.
I
don't
attribute
this
outlook
to
vanity
or
to
a
loaded
self-esteem.
Instead,
I
feel
as
though
it
came
from
a
sturdy
confidence
in
my
work
and
a
great
love
for
composing
it.
This
experience
taught
me
that
those
two
things
are
vital,
not
only
in
revealing
original
works
of
literature,
but
in
revealing
any
part
of
one's
self
to
the
world.
As
the
end
of
high
school
approached,
the
end
of
writing
fortunately
did
not.
In
fact,
12h
grade
proved
to
be
quite
a
busy
year
in
taros
of
literary
composition.
To
begin,
another
yearlong
English
project
about
a
self-chosen
author
culminating
in
a
tremendous
paper
was
assigned,
and
I
decided
to
challenge
myself
by
reading
and
writing
about
Ayn
Rand.
I
set
two
goals
for
myself
at
the
beginning
of
the
project:
1)
to
write
well
enough
so
that
mine
would
be
the
paper
chosen
to
be
photocopied
and
shown
to
next
year's
class,
and
2)
to
earn
a
grade
at
least
as
high
as
that
earned
by
the
student
whose
paper
had
been
photocopied
the
year
before.
Much
reading,
writing
and
rewriting,
determination,
sweat,
and
late
nights
earned
me
the
realization
of
my
second
goal,
but
proved
that
I
simply
had
not
given
enough
to
realize
both
of
my
goals.
Once
again,
while
I
don't
need
others'
approval
to
obtain
confidence
in
my
work,
I
do
need
the
knowledge
that
I
can
measure
up
to
what
others
are
producing,
and
this
experience
spurred
me
onward
and
enabled
me
to
gain
even
more
determination
to
continue
to
try
harder.
More
frustration
was
in
my
future,
however.
A
creative
writing
assignment
was
also
issued
to
the
class,
and
we
were
given
the
option
of
writing
a
short
story
or
a
poem
but
were
told
that
the
poem
would
be
most
challenging
because
our
teacher
found
this
type
of
writing
the
hardest
to
grade.
At
first,
I
thought
that
I
would
take
the
smoothest
way
out
and
just
enjoy
writing
a
short
story,
yet
something
kept
nagging
at
me,
whispering
that
this
was
the
easy
way
out--what
did
I
think
I
was
doing?
As
I
thought
more
and
more
about
my
first
decision
to
write
the
story
instead
of
the
poem,
I
became
increasingly
disgusted
with
myself
at
allowing
myself
the
opportunity
to
even
think
about
doing
this,
and
from
that
point
onward,
I
knew
that
I
never
wanted
to
take
the
road
that
only
asked
for
50%.
I
wanted
to
write
and
be
challenged,
and
so
I
did.
What
a
personal
challenge
this
poem
turned
out
to
be!
I
struggled
with
it--its
wording,
punctuation,
etc.,
and
yet
I
could
not
seem
to
get
a
final
result
that
satisfied
me.
I
felt
as
though
a
cul-de-sac
entrapped
me.
Time
ensued
its
rapid
ticking,
and
before
I
knew
it,
the
due
date
for
our
creative
writing
assignments
was
upon
me.
I
handed
in
my
work
and
worried
about
the
resulting
grade.
The
time
came
when
Mrs.
Genova,
our
English
teacher
was
to
hand
our
assignments
back,
and
a
lurking
dread
filled
my
mind.
However,
I
was
handed
my
poem
and
the
anxiety
producing
red
ink
at
the
top
of
the
page
indicated
that
my
weak
attempt
at
poetry
had
earned
an
A.
What
was
wrong?
Did
she
make
a
mistake?
Did
she
really
mean
to
give
ME
this
grade?
I
never
once
stopped
to
think
that
my
poem
had
actually
earned
that
mark
because
in
my
eyes
it
certainly
had
not.
What
I
thought
of
my
poem
mattered
more
to
me
than
what
she
did,
and
I
couldn't
understand
why
she
did
not
feel
the
same
way
that
I
did
about
what
I
had
written.
Because
of
my
confusion,
I
went
to
see
Mrs.
Genova
after
class
had
ended.
I
explained
to
her
my
feelings
about
how
she
had
viewed
my
poem,
and
she
attempted
to
explain
why
she
had
decided
that
the
poem
entitled
me
to
an
A.
Her
words,
however,
did
nothing
to
relieve
my
frustration
at
having
earned
a
good
mark
with
what
was
to
me
an
inadequate
poem,
and
this
time
in
my
life
has
served
to
teach
me
that
no
matter
how
highly
others
regard
your
work,
it
will
on
ly
be
truly
valuable
if
you
can
do
the
same
and
mean
it.
If
high
school
was
the
Cadillac
of
literary
standards,
college
proved
itself
superior
as
the
limousine
of
"wordly"
challenges.
While
the
expectations
of
others
changed,
my
own
expectations
for
my
writing
stayed
the
same--do
the
best
possible--but
I
learned
that
doing
this
took
something
extra
in
college.
It
took
lack
of
sleep.
In
other
words,
it
took
more
sacrifice.
Not
only
did
one
need
to
have
determination
and
a
desire
to
produce
the
best
work
possible,
one
needed
to
have
the
willpower
in
order
to
devote
the
time
needed
to
produce
not
just
a
respectable
paper,
but
one's
highest
quality
paper.
One
also
needed
to
have
the
capacity
to
sacrifice
an
unneeded
night
with
friends
or
some
other
enjoyable
activity
in
order
to
proofread
that
20
pager
due
the
next
morning
at
8:00
AM
just
one
more
time.
College
gave
me
many
opportunities
to
prove
to
myself
that
I
have
what
it
takes
to
do
this.
For
instance,
my
FYS
brought
with
it
my
first
challenge
of
writing
a
truly
in-depth
and
analytical
research
paper.
I
had
books
upon
books
pertaining
to
literary
criticisms
on
Melville's
Billy
Budd
scattered
around
my
dorm
room,
and
I
picked
his
work
apart
like
I
had
never
done
before.
In
the
end,
an
A
and
a
paper
that
I
was
truly
proud
of
resulted,
but
I
also
learned
a
stinging
lesson
in
the
process.
Due
to
the
fact
that
I
had
invested
so
much
time
in
my
paper
pertaining
to
Billy
Budd,
I
had
to
sacrifice
something
else
in
order
to
do
so.
Sleep
was
sacrificed,
but
so
were
some
of
the
other
readings
for
my
FYS
that
I
knew
would
not
require
a
complementary
written
assignment.
In
other
words,
I
was
able
to
do
an
excellent
job
on
this
paper,
but
only
because
I
had
let
some
of
my
other
responsibilities
slide
by.
To
begin,
I
greatly
dislike
that
I
had
viewed
this
"other
work"
as
less
important
merely
because
it
was
not
to
be
graded,
and
from
that
time
on,
I
have
tried
extremely
hard
to
not
allow
myself
to
judge
the
value
of
school
work
solely
on
whether
or
not
it
will
aid
me
in
earning
a
grade.
There
is
more
to
learning
than
that.
Furthermore,
I
learned
that
this
"excellent
paper"
that
I
had
produced
was
in
truth
not
really
"excellent"
because
it
had
worked
itself
up
to
this
status
due
to
my
decisions
to
sacrifice
what
should
not
have
been
sacrificed.
Yes,
I
do
believe
that
one
needs
to
learn
that
sacrifices
must
be
made
in
order
to
produce
an
outstanding
work,
but
one
must
also
learn
what
sacrifices
are
the
best
to
be
made,
and
this
experience
has
taught
me
a
little
about
how
to
take
stock
of
my
priorities.
Abnormal
Psychology
proved
its
hand
at
aiding
me
in
being
able
to
accomplish
all
that
I
wished
to
in
class
while
giving
everything
I
had
to
my
research
papers
as
well.
Two
extensive
research
papers
were
assigned
to
us
throughout
the
semester,
but
I
did
not
allow
my
work
on
these
to
affect
my
preparation
for
the
rest
of
the
course.
Due
to
this,
my
research
on
both
obsessive-compulsive
disorder
and
pathological
gambling
earned
A's.
The
first
project
even
earned
me
the
privilege
of
having
my
paper
copied
and
put
in
the
library
for
the
next
year's
class
to
use
as
a
reference
when
creating
their
research
papers.
This
honor
is
one
of
my
happiest
literary
memories,
and
it
is
not
marred
by
some
voice
inside
my
head
telling
me
that
I
sacrificed
other
learning
in
this
class
to
earn
it.
Unfortunately,
my
ability
to
do
this
is
still
not
one
that
is
more
than
sporadic,
but
I
am
learning.
Finally,
my
first
year
of
college
also
brought
with
it
a
writing
realization
unrelated
to
the
realm
of
the
classroom.
I
have
been
in
touch
with
a
children's
book
publishing
agency
in
an
attempt
to
publish.
However,
they
desire
a
writing
sample
geared
towards
children,
and
I
have
found
myself
immobilized
and
unable
to
begin
writing
for
them
for
fear
of
rejection.
I
do
not
entirely
realize
where
this
fear
is
coming
from,
as
I
am
not
usually
so
driven
by
a
dread
that
other's
will
not
like
my
work,
but
nonetheless
the
fear
is
still
present
and
unavoidable.
It
is,
however,
aiding
me
in
realizing
that
my
feelings
about
writing
can
be
very
complex
and
take
on
many
different
forms
in
varied
situations.
However,
I
am
also
learning
that
this
is
no
excuse
for
not
pursuing
a
goal,
and
because
of
this,
I
will
be
sending
off
a
writing
sample
as
soon
as
time,
not
fear,
allows,
and
as
I
write
this,
I
have
realized
that
even
though
fear
does
not
usually
affect
my
writing,
I
must
still
not
be
blind
to
the
fact
that
it
can.
My
19
years
have
brought
me
to
several
conclusions
about
the
art
of
writing,
all
of
which
I
carry
with
me
in
my
portfolio
of
memories
to
this
day.
To
begin,
I
have
realized
that
writing
must
be
accompanied
by
a
sense
of
enjoyment,
an
acknowledgement
of
responsibility,
discipline
and
determination,
the
presence
of
hope
and
faith
in
one's
work,
and
a
sheer
love
of
writing.
Without
these,
one's
work
will
never
be
considered
of
great
literary
quality.
However,
one
must
also
learn
that
not
all
writing
must
be
for
a
purpose
or
have
an
end
result
in
mind
but
can
simply
be
for
relaxation.
Secondly,
I
have
concluded
that
to
write
superbly,
not
just
respectably
or
well,
one
needs
to
sacrifice.
However,
in
this
sacrifice
a
balance
must
be
achieved.
I
have
learned
that
I
do
not
tend
to
pick
the
best
tilings
to
sacrifice--other
necessary
schoolwork
or
needed
time
with
friends
and
family
are
among
those
things
that
in
all
circumstances
cannot
be
shoved
to
the
side.
I
am
learning,
however,
and
will
achieve
this
balance
in
time.
Next,
I
have
learned
that
one
can
have
complete
confidence
in
one's
work,
yet
still
desire
and
value
knowing
where
one
stands
in
relation
to
others.
In
the
end,
however,
I
have
also
concluded
that
no
matter
where
one
does
stand
in
relation
to
others,
if
one
is
not
happy
with
one's
own
work,
the
knowledge
that
others
are
will
mean
nothing.
Finally,
I
now
know
that
fear
of
rejection
will
get
one
nowhere
and
usually
guarantees
one's
safe
return
to
the
same
starting
point
if
one
does
even
decide
to
venture
out.
Because
of
this,
one
must
never
be
ashamed
to
take
a
chance
or
to
take
one's
writing
to
a
new
level.
These
insights
have
been
what
my
writing
experiences
have
taught
me
thus
far,
and
because
of
this
knowledge,
writing
has
been
and
will
continue
to
be
not
only
a
necessary
tool
of
living
in
the
public
world,
but
a
vessel
towards
personal
insight,
a
mode
of
personal
enjoyment,
and
a
means
to
fulfill
personal
challenges
as
well--even
if
I
do
decide
to
stick
with
the
black
crayon.

Dear
Miss
Zerr:
Thank
you
for
your
letter
asking
about
writing
articles.
Although
we
are
unable
to
offer
you
much
encouragement
about
writing
prospects
at
Reader's
Digest,
as
most
of
our
original
articles
are
prepared
by
regular
contributors,
we
are
pleased
to
hear
of
your
interest
in
this
field.
Your
best
general
sources
of
information
are
magazines
such
as
The
Writer
or
the
directory
of
publications,
Writer's
Market.
It's
usually
best
to
start
on
a
small
scale
by
approaching
a
local
newspaper
or
a
regional
or
limited-circulation
magazine
with
several
well-developed
story
ideas.
Writer's
Market
is
most
helpful
here
by
outlining
the
specific
needs
and
requirements
of
individual
magazines.
We
hope
this
letter
has
been
of
help.
Good
luckl
Sincerely,
Elinor
