My
Life
in
Writing
She
was
the
coolest,
most
confident
girl
I
had
ever
laid
eyes
upon.
From
the
moment
we
met
on
the
yellow
twisty
slide
at
Washington
Avenue
Elementary
School
I
knew
that
I
would
be
the
luckiest
girl
in
the
world
if
she
was
to
befriend
me.
That
very
first
day
of
Kindergarten
exposed
me
to
something
much
more
exciting
than
building
blocks
and
nap
time;
it
introduced
me
to
Kelly
McCabe.
In
my
five
year
old
eyes
Kelly
was
everything
I
was
not,
and
everything
I
had
ever
dreamed
of
being.
I
had
always
been
the
quiet,
shy,
timid,
spineless
child
in
an
ever
growing
family
of
loud,
outspoken,
overwhelming
people,
but
Kelly
changed
me.
I
was
used
to
being
the
third
wheel
to
my
two
older
sisters,
who
I
tried
desperately
and
unsuccessfully
to
impress
on
a
daily
basis.
Like
all
children
I
had
a
desire
to
be
someoneOs
best
friend,
and
since
my
older
sisters
played
the
best
friend
roll
for
each
other,
that
special
someone
for
me
turned
out
to
be
Kelly.
From
the
beginning
of
our
friendship
she
dominated
as
the
master
and
I
followed
willingly
as
her
loyal
dog.
Whatever
Kelly
did
I
wanted
to
do,
and
whatever
Kelly
said
I
automatically
agreed
with,
no
matter
how
ridiculous.
Although
this
new
mentality
led
me
to
innumerable
timeouts,
it
also
guided
me
to
a
childhood
full
of
adventure.
During
the
year
that
I
met
Kelly
she
led
me
to
believe
that
being
a
boy
was
a
much
more
attractive
way
of
life,
so
together
we
turned
in
our
Barbies
and
ballet
slippers
for
muddy
shorts
and
smelly
soccer
cleats.
In
second
grade
Kelly
and
I
were
both
in
Mrs.
GresunskiOs
class;
a
cluttered,
cramped,
and
cheery
room,
where
I
began
to
have
my
first
memorable
experiences
with
writing.
At
this
point
in
my
life
my
mother
was
pregnant
with
her
fifth
and
final
child,
and
I
had
been
instructed
to
keep
a
journal
detailing
any
baby
related
events.
In
retrospect
this
assignment
was
probably
to
ensure
that
I
did
not
feel
overshadowed
by
the
presence
of
my
newest
family
member,
but
my
older
sisters
already
had
me
feeling
excluded
as
far
as
the
family
was
concerned.
KellyOs
assignment
was
to
document
her
thriving
Chatham
Cubs
soccer
career,
and
every
Friday
after
school,
during
our
weekly
play
date,
we
would
munch
on
gooey
pizza
and
talk
about
our
journals.
A
while
after
our
journals
were
completed
and
handed
in
Kelly
told
me
that
she
had
a
surprise
for
me.
I
followed
her
into
her
bedroom
where
she
pulled
out
two
black
spiral
notebooks
with
NKelly
&
BeckyO
scratched
onto
the
front.
I
eagerly
turned
my
notebook
over
to
find
the
words
NBEST
FRIENDSO
written
in
whiteout.
At
this
very
moment
my
life
was
complete;
a
trip
to
the
moon
would
have
failed
to
be
more
exciting
than
this
journal.
The
most
amazing
girl
at
Washington
Avenue
Elementary
School
was
my
best
friend,
and
I
could
not
wait
for
everyone
else
to
know
it.
For
weeks
Kelly
and
I
would
write
in
our
notebooks
in
glitter
gel
and
multicolored
milk
pens
(they
were
all
the
rage
on
the
playground).
The
content
of
our
journals
escapes
my
memory,
but
the
one
entry
I
do
remember
is
one
in
which
I
had
written
only
three
simple
words,
Nbest
friends
foreverO,
below
a
pitiful
excuse
for
a
picture.
I
had
never
been
much
of
an
artist,
but
at
the
time
that
stick
figure
drawing
of
Kelly
and
me
seemed
to
be
as
beautiful
as
the
Mona
Lisa
herself.
Kelly
had
always
been
a
disorganized,
disheveled
child,
and
soon
enough
she
lost
her
journal.
She
quickly
convinced
me
that
we
should
only
keep
journals
once
we
had
boyfriends
to
write
secretly
about,
and
without
question
I
threw
my
once
sacred
journal
away.
From
that
day
until
the
end
of
fifth
grade
Kelly
and
I
were
best
friends,
spending
every
waking
moment
together.
In
sixth
grade
her
parents
hoped
that
Catholic
school
could
change
her
aggressive
NTom
BoyO
ways,
and
Kelly
and
I
naturally
grew
apart.
My
focus
eventually
shifted
from
playing
with
salamanders
and
dirt
to
schoolwork
and
any
sport
I
could
get
myself
involved
in.
I
applied
myself
thoroughly
and
did
extremely
well
in
school,
but
credit
for
these
accomplishments
should
be
given
mostly
to
my
parents.
They
were
always
encouraging
me
to
exceed
expectations
and
never
settle
for
being
average.
In
retrospect
they
may
have
been
a
bit
too
intense
in
coaching
both
my
athletics
and
my
academics,
but
without
their
added
pressure
it
is
quite
possible
that
I
would
not
have
accomplished
as
much
as
I
have.
They
shaped
me
into
a
driven,
hardworking
young
woman,
and
for
that
I
will
always
thank
them.
Freshmen
year
of
high
school
is
where
I
first
encountered
difficulty
with
writing.
In
Mrs.
PorporaOs
honors
English
class
I
received
a
B-
on
an
in
class
textual
analysis
of
ShakespeareOs
Romeo
and
Juliet.
I
had
never
before
received
a
grade
below
a
B+,
and
even
those
grades
put
a
sour
taste
in
my
mouth.
Upon
receiving
the
grade
I
was
absolutely
hysterical
and
unable
to
be
consoled.
My
teacher
was
clearly
shocked
by
my
reaction,
and
had
no
idea
what
to
say
to
help
me
regain
control
of
my
waterworks.
Eventually
I
calmed
myself
down
and
was
able
to
talk
with
her
about
my
paper.
During
that
conference
Mrs.
Porpora
struggled
to
explain
to
me
that
I
was
what
she
called
a
Nsurface
reader.O
I
did
not
take
the
time
nor
make
the
effort
to
delve
below
the
explicit
meaning
of
the
text,
and
that
is
what
had
hurt
my
paper.
From
that
moment
on
I
read
each
and
every
assignment
with
a
pen
and
a
highlighter
in
hand,
writing
immaculate
notes
in
my
notebook
to
ensure
that
I
never
again
got
another
B-.
To
this
day
I
still
find
myself
marking
up
texts
almost
beyond
recognition,
writing
in
the
margins
and
drawing
arrows
and
asterisks
all
over
the
pages.
For
almost
an
entire
year
I
dreaded
writing
any
kind
of
paper
because
I
knew
that
another
B-
was
a
possibility
that
I
did
not
want
to
have
to
face.
Sophomore
year
honors
English
was
not
very
different
from
Mrs.
PorporaOs
class.
Mrs.
Anderson
was
my
teacher,
and
she
was
notorious
for
not
giving
AOs.
I
cautiously
wrote
each
paper
expecting
a
B+,
a
grade
that
I
received
time
after
time.
Although
I
was
initially
angry
with
myself
for
settling
on
anything
other
than
an
A,
I
truly
believed
that
Mrs.
Anderson
was
incapable
of
marking
a
red
A
on
anyoneOs
paper.
In
the
spring
of
my
sophomore
year
I
received
my
first
and
only
creative
writing
assignment
for
honors
English.
It
was
an
open
assignment
in
which
I
had
to
make
the
setting
of
my
short
story
come
alive.
This
assignment
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
I
ever
looked
at
writing
as
an
opportunity
for
an
emotional
release.
I
remember
walking
up
the
hill
that
I
lived
on
and
perching
myself
on
a
tombstone
at
the
top
of
the
cemetery,
overlooking
the
New
York
City
skyline.
I
had
lived
below
this
cemetery
my
entire
life
and
never
saw
it
as
a
scary
place,
only
as
a
calming
place
full
of
quiet
and
rid
of
chaos,
essentially
the
opposite
of
my
home.
There
I
sat
for
an
unknown
amount
of
time,
and
wrote
about
September
11,
2001.
When
I
handed
in
the
paper
I
expected
yet
another
B+,
the
same
predictable
grade
I
had
been
getting
all
year
long.
As
Mrs.
Anderson
returned
my
paper
about
a
week
later
she
placed
it
face
down
on
my
desk
and
asked
me
to
read
it
aloud
to
the
class.
I
hesitantly
turned
it
over
to
find
the
impossible
red
A
gracing
the
cover
of
my
paper.
After
reading
the
paper
aloud
one
student,
the
only
person
I
have
ever
known
to
drop
out
of
high
school,
asked
me
if
my
parents
had
died
on
9/11.
I
thought
this
was
a
peculiar
question,
but
I
politely
responded
Nno.O
The
boy,
Ian,
said
that
he
did
not
mean
to
be
rude,
but
that
he
had
made
the
assumption
that
the
emotion
from
my
paper
had
been
inspired
by
real
life
distress
and
heartache.
At
the
time
this
compliment
did
not
register
with
me,
and
I
allowed
my
scholastic
achievement
to
inflate
my
confidence
for
the
rest
of
the
day.
Later
that
year
a
tragedy
changed
my
life.
One
of
my
best
friends,
Teddy
Ahsler,
died
of
cancer.
This
sixteen
year
old
boy,
who
I
had
first
met
in
preschool,
was
the
first
person
I
had
ever
known
to
die.
I
had
never
been
to
a
funeral
before;
I
had
never
sat
Shiva;
I
had
never
had
to
mourn
the
death,
or
celebrate
the
life
of
anyone,
and
at
sixteen
a
cloak
of
sadness
wrapped
itself
around
my
whole
world.
I
was
old
enough
to
know
what
had
happened,
but
not
old
enough
to
understand
it.
I
did
not
know
how
to
cope
with
something
like
this
and
I
failed
to
find
comfort
in
my
friends
or
family.
Each
day
I
had
to
drive
past
the
cemetery
that
Teddy
was
buried
in,
and
every
time
I
felt
a
pang
of
guilt
for
knowing
that
I
had
so
much
left
to
say
to
my
friend.
One
day
that
summer
I
was
walking
my
dog
past
the
cemetery
and
decided
that
I
was
ready
to
talk
to
Teddy.
I
went
home
and
sat
down
in
my
humid,
pottery
barn
room,
and
wrote
Teddy
a
letter.
It
was
the
first
time
I
had
used
a
pen
and
paper
to
write
anything
since
before
high
school;
fortunately
for
those
of
us
with
pitiful
penmanship,
all
of
my
teachers
required
assignments
to
be
typed
on
the
computer.
I
poured
my
thoughts
into
a
three
page
letter,
sealed
it
in
a
long
blue
envelope,
and
walked
it
up
to
TeddyOs
grave
that
very
night.
That
letter
allowed
me
to
pour
out
my
frustrations,
angst,
and
sadness
without
having
to
absorb
sympathy
from
others.
Sympathy
is
something
I
simply
cannot
handle.
I
never
wrote
to
Teddy
again,
but
I
do
continue
to
visit
him
quite
often.
Upon
entering
Lafayette
College
in
the
fall
of
2008
I
felt
well
prepared
for
college
writing.
I
had
been
told
many
times
that
Chatham
High
School
has
extremely
high
standards
for
its
students,
so
I
had
confidence
that
my
high
school
teachers
had
adequately
prepared
me
for
Lafayette.
I
had
learned
the
mechanics
of
a
well
written
paper;
topic
sentence,
thesis,
supporting
evidence,
transitions
and
so
on.
However,
my
Freshmen
Year
Seminar
provided
me
with
challenges
that
I
had
never
encountered
in
high
school,
such
as
a
ten
page
research
paper.
Research
and
I
have
never
been
great
friends,
and
this
did
not
change
at
the
beginning
of
my
Lafayette
experience.
My
FYS
professor
did
teach
me
many
new
research
resources
which
led
me
to
realize
that
research
papers
do
not
always
have
to
seem
overwhelming
and
stressful.
This
realization
helped
me
write
quite
a
successful
research
paper
for
my
VAST
during
my
sophomore
year.
Ironically,
my
VAST
research
paper
turned
out
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
writing
pieces
from
college
thus
far.
Although
I
would
still
categorize
a
research
paper
as
my
least
favorite
genre,
my
final
VAST
research
paper
combined
research
and
creative
writing
in
an
extremely
unique
way.
The
final
product
for
this
assignment
was
a
humorous,
engaging,
and
informative
paper
about
a
seemingly
dense
and
boring
steel-making
process.
The
research
for
this
paper
was
tedious
and
time
consuming,
but
the
creative
to
write
the
paper
according
to
my
own
guidelines
infused
the
assignment
with
a
surprising
element
of
fun.
I
took
my
time
writing
a
sarcastic,
almost
cheesy,
textbook-like
paper.
What
initially
seemed
to
be
a
pointless
and
ridiculous
assignment
ended
up
being
one
of
my
favorite
pieces
of
college
writing.
My
favorite
piece
that
I
have
written
while
at
Lafayette
College
was
a
poem
for
my
College
Writing
portfolio.
I
truly
do
not
even
remember
the
assignment,
but
I
wrote
a
poem
about
my
personal
experiences
with
panic
disorder.
Panic
attacks
have
been
a
part
of
my
life
since
I
was
thirteen
years
old.
They
are
painful,
uncomfortable,
exhausting
and
terrifying.
As
I
have
grown
older
I
have
learned
to
control
the
panic
attacks,
but
under
certain
circumstances
they
are
simply
unavoidable.
One
of
the
novels
I
read
for
my
College
Writing
class
described
a
soldier
having
a
panic
attack,
and
I
chose
to
focus
my
poem
on
this
event.
I
wrote
the
poem
effortlessly
and
honestly,
and
when
it
was
finished
I
felt
a
great
sense
of
relief.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
had
written
something
and
not
instantly
wondered
what
grade
I
would
receive.
I
was
truly
satisfied
with
what
I
had
written
and
I
did
not
have
the
slightest
concern
what
my
professor
would
think
of
it.
Ultimately
I
earned
an
A
in
the
class,
but
more
important
than
the
grade
was
the
experience
of
combining
my
personal
experiences
and
emotions
with
an
assignment,
creating
something
utterly
unpredictable.
As
an
English
major
I
look
forward
to
many
more
challenging
classes
in
which
I
hope
to
learn
more
new
writing
techniques.
I
also
plan
on
producing
many
more
writing
pieces
that
explore
new
parts
of
my
creativity
and
lead
me
to
a
further
sense
of
accomplishment.
Academic
disappointment,
although
dreaded,
is
also
most
likely
in
my
future
as
well.
From
these
less
than
outstanding
experiences
I
hope
to
realize
my
writing
weaknesses
and
improve
them.
