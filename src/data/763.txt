Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative
I
have
never
considered
myself
a
very
strong
writer
and
never
really
thought
my
papers
were
great.
Most
of
my
writing
process
ended
up
quite
rushed
because
in
comparison
to
exams,
the
exams
were
more
daunting
and
thus
took
the
focus
of
my
attention.
Becoming
a
Writing
Associate
meant
that
for
the
first
time
I
was
really
asked
to
slow
down
and
think
about
the
process
of
writing.
I
had
never
really
thought
about
my
own
process
D
it
was
always
get
the
job
done.
The
weekly
staff
meetings
gave
me
tools
to
think
about
writing
and
terminology
that
seemed
to
fit.
Various
things
I
knew
to
avoid
in
writing
suddenly
had
formal
names
and
it
seemed
that
I
was
doing
the
correct
things
for
Ncollege
levelO
writing.
In
staff
meetings,
we
talked
about
how
in
most
cases
learning
how
to
be
a
college
writer
was
trial
by
fire
with
no
sure
guidance
on
how
to
do
well.
While
subject
material
in
some
courses
were
difficult
for
me
to
wrap
my
head
around,
once
I
understood
the
task
at
hand
the
writing
process
wasnOt
the
hard
part.
And
as
a
WA
it
was
the
first
time
I
was
really
seeing
other
studentsO
trials
in
writing.
IOm
not
implying
that
writing
always
came
easy
for
me
D
I
in
fact
didnOt
learn
how
to
read
or
write
until
the
second
grade.
My
own,
seemingly
everlasting,
insecurities
about
my
writing
ability
prevented
me
from
seeing
how
well
my
high
school
prepared
me
to
enter
college
level
writing.
So
the
fact
that
writing
in
college
never
seemed
that
difficult
nor
my
jump
to
college
level
that
large
was
always
a
surprise.
Being
a
WA
has
meant
that
IOve
finally
had
a
way
to
think
and
approach
writing.
Interactions
with
students
in
the
classes
I
was
assigned
caused
a
lot
of
introspection.
Seeing
students
struggle
through
this
trial
by
fire
that
is
college
writing
made
me
realize
how
fortunate
I
was
to
come
from
background
that
meant
I
was
ready
to
handle
my
writing
assignments.
While
staff
meetings
gave
me
terminology
and
new
ideas
to
think
about,
my
real
growth
from
being
a
WA
came
from
student
interactions.
Not
only
has
being
a
WA
improved
my
confidence
in
my
own
skill
but
it
has
also
caused
improvement
in
other
skill
areas.
The
biggest
improvement
for
me
was
in
communication.
For
better
or
worse,
youOre
stuck
with
your
class
assignment
and
the
students
in
that
class
come
in
varied
forms.
IOve
interacted
with
many
students
I
probably
would
never
have
had
come
in
contact
with.
And
these
students
all
carry
their
own
baggage
about
writing.
As
a
WA,
IOve
had
to
learn
how
to
be
flexible
in
conferences
and
adjust
my
thought
process
to
fit
whatever
the
particular
student
needs.
Personally,
humor
hasnOt
been
a
strong
suit
as
sarcasm
and
dry
wit
have
been
the
better
fit
but
IOve
found
it
useful
in
conferences.
Surprisingly
humor,
often
times
in
the
form
of
self
deprecation,
allowed
me
to
form
a
bridge
to
the
student
I
was
working
with.
Establishing
that
bridge
is
necessary
because
the
student
needs
to
be
able
to
trust
your
advice
while
still
feeling
that
they
are
in
charge
of
their
own
writing
process.
These
student
interactions
have
caused
me
to
become
a
better
judge
of
a
situation
and
I
have
a
better
sense
of
when
humor
would
work
or
when
it
wouldnOt.
If
humor
didnOt
work
then
it
would
be
something
else
and
the
process
of
learning
how
to
be
flexible
has
caused
my
ability
to
communicate
to
improve.
Humor
became
a
communication
tool
that
I
probably
wouldnOt
have
developed
had
I
not
been
a
WA
and
needed
it.
IOve
also
learned
that
my
background
is
quite
unusual
so
many
of
the
examples
that
I
think
of
as
common
sense
donOt
actually
work
for
the
majority
of
people.
My
communication
skills
have
improved
because
IOve
learned
how
to
adjust
examples
to
fit
the
student
IOm
interacting
with.
It
was
Prof.
Tatu
that
pointed
out
my
comparison
to
grammar
and
feeling
of
rhythm
when
reading
poetry
wasnOt
a
good
example
for
many
students
as
most
donOt
have
experience
in
reading
poetry
aloud.
So
IOve
figured
out
better
and
more
relevant
ways
to
discuss
grammar
and
the
flow
of
a
paper.
Part
of
this
job
is
knowing
when
an
example
works
and
when
to
ask
the
student
if
they
need
clarification
or
a
completely
different
way
to
discuss
an
issue.
I
donOt
have
it
all
down
just
yet,
but
each
conference
as
a
WA
has
caused
my
communication
skills
to
grow
as
I
bend
my
examples
or
create
new
ones
on
the
spot
to
fit
the
student
and
the
particular
paper.
IOm
not
sure
if
I
knew
before
becoming
a
WA
that
flexibility
was
a
very
important
trait.
Being
flexible
doesnOt
only
come
up
in
communication.
My
classes
so
far
have
been
made
up
of
freshmen
and
sophomores
who
have
very
different
senses
of
how
useful
a
WA
is.
It
has
been
much
easier
to
get
freshmen
to
show
up
to
conferences.
I
think
it
must
be
the
holdover
from
some
kind
of
high
school
mentality
about
authoritative
figures.
WAing
a
VAST
full
of
disillusioned
sophomores
meant
being
flexible
was
extremely
important
especially
with
the
last
minute
cancelations
of
conferences
or
the
no-shows.
This
job
means
that
you
have
to
get
in
all
of
your
conferences
so
when
students
donOt
appear
for
their
conferences
and
throw
your
entire
schedule
into
disarray
you
not
only
have
to
figure
out
a
way
to
make
it
work
you
also
have
to
be
able
to
work
with
the
student
who
caused
the
disruption
without
personal
annoyance
coming
through.
That
means
being
flexible
and
understanding
of
a
situation.
It
means
learning
when
you
can
handle
a
situation
by
yourself
or
when
you
need
to
get
the
class
professor
involved.
IOve
become
more
flexible
as
a
WA
in
figuring
out
how
to
interact
with
students
and
it
has
caused
me
to
be
more
flexible
in
my
own
life.
Over
the
course
of
WAing
three
different
classes
IOve
become
a
way
better
communicator.
ItOs
also
given
me
a
window
on
various
studentsO
personal
growth
as
a
writers
which
at
times
can
be
pretty
cool.
There
are
the
students
who
no
matter
how
hard
you
try
you
wonOt
be
able
to
get
through
to.
And
there
are
the
students
who
donOt
seem
to
need
to
help
and
itOs
a
struggle
to
figure
out
the
areas
in
which
they
can
improve.
But
to
actually
see
students
improve
over
the
course
of
a
semester
and
some
part
of
that
is
because
you
helped
them
develop
tools
to
improve
their
own
writing
is
kind
of
amazing.
The
VAST
I
WAed
in
the
Spring
semester
had
a
transfer
student
from
a
community
college
who
was
really
receptive
to
my
ideas
and
comments.
He
wasnOt
the
best
writer
in
the
class
but
I
enjoyed
working
with
him
the
most
because
the
conference
was
an
ongoing
conversation
about
his
ability,
his
concerns,
and
his
goals
in
writing.
Over
four
conferences,
I
saw
a
clear
improvement
in
his
writing
skill
as
he
was
able
to
take
my
suggestions
and
examples
from
a
previous
paper
and
turn
them
into
tools
he
could
use
on
future
papers.
IOve
influenced
students
over
the
course
of
a
year
but
through
these
interactions
these
students
have
also
influenced
me.
Being
a
WA
has
made
me
a
better
writer
because
IOm
a
better
communicator,
more
flexible,
and
have
an
increasing
repertoire
of
tools
that
I
can
use
that
I
didnOt
have
a
year
ago.
This
repertoire
includes
the
facilitative
approach
which
IOve
found
very
useful.
I
enjoy
asking
questions
and
it
has
been
a
great
tool
in
conferences.
Conferences
can
be
a
scary
thing
for
both
the
student
and
the
WA.
These
students
walk
in
expecting
some
kind
of
judgment
on
their
paper
but
the
goal
isnOt
to
give
them
your
judgment.
The
goal
is
help
the
student
improve
as
a
writer.
Figuring
out
the
best
way
to
push
students
to
improve
without
coming
across
negatively
or
giving
them
a
task
list
would
be
difficult
without
the
facilitative
approach.
Questions
are
good
because
it
allows
you
get
better
insight
on
the
student
while
forcing
them
to
think
more
deeply
on
a
subject.
IOve
asked
students
why
they
use
punctuation
to
begin
with
and
mostly
gotten
a
textbook
answer
about
fragments
and
clauses
and
some
other
bits
of
a
definition.
My
follow
up
is
why
do
we
use
words?
We
use
words
to
communicate
something
and
the
something
in
the
conference
is
their
assignment.
Punctuation
is
just
another
aspect
of
communication
similar
to
words.
These
questions
have
given
me
a
way
to
example
multiple
things
from
comma
usage
to
the
difference
between
reader-based
prose
and
writer-based
prose.
And
by
making
the
conference
interactive,
IOve
found
that
it
makes
the
whole
thing
seem
a
little
less
daunting
to
the
student.
WA
conferences
using
the
facilitative
approach
turn
a
conference
into
a
conversation
not
only
about
the
studentOs
particular
paper
but
also
about
the
way
they
think
and
approach
writing.
The
goal
is
to
help
them
improve
their
writing
ability.
Not
improve
on
this
one
paper
or
in
this
one
class,
but
to
improve
in
a
way
that
means
all
of
their
future
writing
will
be
at
least
a
little
bit
better
and
a
little
bit
stronger.
The
facilitative
approach
is
useful
because
it
gave
me
a
way
to
think
about
how
to
accomplish
this
goal.
And
in
trying
to
find
the
best
way
to
do
this
meant
that
I
had
to
think
about
my
own
process.
IOm
often
asked
how
do
I
write
a
paper
which
before
becoming
a
WA
I
never
really
thought
of.
The
questions
I
was
asking
students
were
questions
that
I
needed
to
answer
too
and
the
process
of
thinking
about
writing
has
made
me
more
confident
in
my
skill
and
allowed
me
to
becoming
a
stronger
writer.
IOve
come
to
believe
that
conferences
go
better
when
you
have
a
better
sense
of
the
student
and
when
youOve
made
some
kind
of
connection.
This
summer
I
worked
as
the
WA
for
the
SPAL
program.
SPAL
brings
onto
campus
10
incoming
freshmen
who
are
minorities,
in
some
aspect,
in
the
STEM
fields
and
who
are
planning
on
majoring
in
the
STEM
fields
for
classes
and
modules
that
will
give
them
a
strong
foundation
to
be
leaders
at
Lafayette.
One
of
the
classes
these
freshmen
took
was
College
Writing
D
so
I
was
the
WA
for
that
class.
But
I
was
also
a
student
mentor
and
went
with
them
to
all
of
their
modules,
lunches
and
activities
for
six
weeks.
As
a
result,
we
all
got
to
know
one
another
really
well.
Having
that
kind
of
rapport
with
these
students
meant
that
I
was
really
able
to
tailor
my
conferences
to
each
student.
It
also
meant
that
spontaneous
conversations
occurred
about
what
they
were
doing
in
class
or
what
they
were
thinking
about
for
a
paper.
It
would
be
impossible
to
recreate
that
kind
of
interaction
with
a
normal
class
as
interactions
with
students
during
a
regular
semester
is
vastly
smaller
and
typically
most
WAs
have
had
more
than
10
students.
But
really
getting
to
know
the
student
not
only
made
my
job
easier
in
some
senses
but
also
made
the
conferences
more
useful.
I
didnOt
have
to
always
spend
time
in
the
conference
figuring
out
who
they
were
and
what
approach
would
work
best.
I
knew
them
and
went
into
conferences
with
ideas
of
how
to
approach
different
issues.
This
coming
semester,
I
plan
on
trying
to
get
to
know
my
students
better.
I
think
that
this
will
make
me
a
stronger
WA
and
improve
my
conferencing
skills.
To
the
best
of
my
ability,
I
would
like
to
tailor
the
different
tools
I
was
taught
over
the
course
of
a
year
to
each
individual
student
that
I
am
interacting
with.
This
will
make
the
conferences
smoother
and
more
beneficial
to
the
students.
