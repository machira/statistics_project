Literacy
Narrative
Not
too
long
ago
my
mother
and
I
sat
at
the
kitchen
table,
eating
dinner.
A
peaceful
silence
lingered
between
us
as
we
exalted
in
the
virtues
of
life,
love,
and
five-minute
cuisine.
Desperate
for
conversation
to
match
the
excellence
of
our
chicken
stir-fry,
I
blurted:
vHey,
remember
that
time
my
kindergarten
teacher
told
you
that
I
was
mentally
retarded?g
vOf
course
I
remember,g
my
mother
replied.
I
hung
my
head
over
my
vegetables.
vOh
Jenny,
please.
You
came
out
of
the
womb
constructing
sentences.g
My
question
was
grounded
in
truth;
my
motheres
response
was
not.
It
wasnet
until
I
had
been
out
of
the
womb
for
a
little
over
three
years
that
I
sat
hunched
over
our
yellow
Fisher
Price
table
set,
writing
all
of
the
letters
that
I
knew
with
thick
crayons.
For
the
letters
I
didnet
know,
I
drew
pretty
lines.
vIs
this
a
word?g
vNo,
honey.g
My
mother
only
half-glanced
at
my
picture,
because
All
My
Children
was
on.
vIs
THIS
a
word?g
vNo.g
vIS
THIS
A
WORD?g
vJenny
honey,
canet
you
see
that
I--wait.
I
thinkShch.I
think
that
says
dtoye
actuallyShchyes!
Sandy,
look
at
this!g
Propelled
by
my
Crayola-induced
brilliance,
I
wrote
more
words.
Eventually,
the
words
evolved
into
a
series
of
stories
about
a
rabbit
whose
name
was,
incidentally,
Little
Rabbit.
Little
Rabbit
did
many
thingsbshe
went
outside
to
play,
she
went
to
school,
she
went
missing
(although
in
an
unanticipated
twist
in
plot,
the
magic
fairy
revealed
that
she
was
actually
sick
with
the
flu).
I
provided
the
illustrations,
my
mother
writing
down
the
words
as
I
dictated
them.
At
night
my
dad
would
sit
at
the
edge
of
my
bed
and
read
from
The
Berenstein
Bears,
his
voice
dipping
way
down
low
for
Papa
Bear
and
fluttering
into
a
falsetto
for
Mama
Bear.
Eagerly
I
awaited
kindergarten,
where
I
could
write
my
own
stories,
turning
my
family
into
animals
and
create
fun
activities
for
all
of
us
to
do.
Kindergarten
was
fine,
at
first.
We
played
with
blocks,
frolicked
around
the
black
top,
and
learned
the
correlation
between
vrespectful
behaviorg
and
happy
face
stickers.
We
even
colored
Brown
Bear.
When
it
came
time
to
initial
our
work,
I
knew
exactly
what
to
do.
Because
I
had
been
writing
my
name
for
such
a
long
timebconstruction
paper,
walls,
whereverbI
decided
to
give
my
name
some
added
flare
by
turning
the
vJg
backwards.
vJenny,
we
write
our
dJes
the
other
way
around,g
Mrs.
D
noted.
She
bent
down
and
traced
a
proper
dJe
next
to
my
erroneous
one.
vOkay.g
I
was
only
appeasing
her;
the
Jes
looked
so
much
cooler
when
written
backwards.
I
continued
to
write
them
as
such,
and
Mrs.
D
continued
to
correct
me.
After
this
had
gone
on
for
a
week
or
so,
she
handed
me
an
envelope
and
said
vGive
this
to
your
mother.g
After
school,
I
flounced
on
the
couch
for
my
daily
session
of
Sesame
Street.
My
mother
sat
down
beside
me.
vJenny,
wait
a
sec
before
you
turn
that
on.g
vYeah?g
vListenShch..donet
write
your
dJes
backwards
anymore,
okay?g
vWhy?g
vWell,
I
think
Mrs.
D
has
trouble
reading
your
name
that
way.
You
donet
want
her
to
get
confused,
right?
So
youell
have
to
write
more
clearly
from
now
on,
okay?g
vYeah.g
vGood.
Now
go
ahead,
watch.g
Only
years
later
would
my
mother
tell
me
what
was
really
contained
in
that
note
home:
Mrs.
Des
concern
had
been
supplemented
by
possible
dates
in
which
I
could
be
screened
for
the
special
ed
class.
Thankfully,
my
mother
paid
no
attention
to
Mrs.
Des
suggestions;
instead,
she
encouraged
my
writing.
And
write
I
did.
By
first
grade
I
had
long
abandoned
the
life
and
times
of
Little
Rabbit,
instead
writing
a
story
about
a
group
of
girls
who
thought
their
new
neighbor
was
an
alien.
In
the
end,
she
was
only
from
California
(clearly,
plot
twists
were
my
specialty).
At
snack
time,
my
classmates
would
gather
round
me
in
a
circle
of
carpet
squares
and
stuffed
animals
as
I
read
my
own
renditions
of
Shel
Silverstein
aloud.
Yet
at
the
epicenter
of
this
carpet-squared
fame
was
the
solace
I
found
in
writing.
When
I
wasnet
reading
my
work
aloud,
I
was
incredibly
shy.
What
I
didnet
say,
I
wrote.
Crouched
in
the
corner
of
my
not-so-spacious
closet,
I
would
etch
my
innermost
thoughts
into
a
turquoise
Simba
diary.
Tonight
we
ate
spaghetti
and
clamsauce
for
dinner,
I
wrote,
making
sure
my
hot
pink
viges
were
carefully
dotted.
The
emotional
depth
of
these
entries
might
have
increased
over
the
years--boys,
instead
of
dinnersbbut
the
nightly
practice
of
writing
did
not
change.
And
then
came
the
time
that
my
short-lived
writing
career
took
a
very
long
hiatus.
In
fifth
grade,
vConcert
Bandg
was
added
to
our
standard
five-block
curriculum.
My
brother
was
well
on
his
way
to
becoming
a
musician,
and
so
I
assumed
that
my
future,
too,
was
inscribed
within
the
lines
of
the
G
cleff
staff.
Whereas
my
fervor
for
reading
and
writing
had
blissfully
coexisted
with
my
life,
music
was
all
encompassing.
I
could
not,
would
not
pay
attention
to
anything
else.
For
the
subsequent
six
years
or
so,
my
trumpet
dominated
the
scene.
I
suppose
that
somewhere
in
the
midst
of
my
cornet
solos
and
trumpet
concertos
I
learned
how
to
write
essays.
Or
at
least,
I
partially
learned.
vSo
we
haveShchGeometry,
Enriched
Biology,
World
History,
College
Prep
EnglishShch.g
My
high
school
guidance
counselor
paused.
vWhat
are
you
doing
in
College
Prep
English?g
vWell,
I
mean,
you
saw
my
8th
grade
writing
gradesbI
got
a
dCeg.
vBut
you
had
Aes
for
the
other
three
marking
periods.
I
donet
get
it.g
She
peered
suspiciously
at
me
from
behind
my
transcript.
vShe
said
I
wasnet
working
to
my
potential
because
I
missed
too
many
classes
for
band
lessons.
I
mean,
I
want
to
go
to
Juilliard,
so
my
Writing
grades
donet
matter.g
vWellShch.Iell
put
you
in
the
Enriched
class
anyway.
Just
in
case.g
Ites
difficult
for
a
high
school
freshman
with
dreams
of
Louis
Armstrong
to
feel
motivated
to
write
essays
on
Beowulf,
The
Odyssey,
and
The
Canterbury
Talesball
of
these
highly
appropriate
for
high
schoolers.
Far
too
often
I
would
tell
my
teacher
I
had
a
band
lesson,
trot
down
the
hall
to
the
band
room,
and
practice.
Always,
I
chose
Haydn
over
Homer.
Even
when
a
short-lived
stint
with
Juilliard
PreCollege
put
an
end
to
my
music
career,
I
did
not
return
to
any
of
my
old
interests.
My
last
two
years
of
high
school
were
spent
on
medical
leave,
and
home
instruction
left
me
with
little
opportunity
to
develop
writing
skills.
It
wasnet
until
college
that
I
was
re
introduced
to
my
old
passion.
I
sat
with
the
other
students
in
my
First
Year
Seminar
class,
rapt,
as
our
professor
gave
an
entire
lecture
about
the
virtues
of
a
vsexy
pen.g
He
himself,
he
said,
was
the
owner
of
a
very
impressive
collection,
which
he
carefully
spread
across
a
desk
before
our
admiring
eyes.
vI
want
all
of
you
to
go
out,
and
buy
yourselves
a
sexy
pen,g
he
said,
voice
dipping
into
a
velvety
tenor.
vYou
need
to
fall
in
love
with
writing,
to
appreciate
its
sensuality.
Writing
is,
ultimately,
a
sensual
experience.g
I
was
intrigued
by
the
professor,
to
be
sure,
but
his
assignment
irked
me.
Writing
was
not
always
sensual,
and
its
magic
was
certainly
not
contingent
upon
the
pen.
When
I
was
in
third
grade,
I
read
that
my
then-favorite
author
Roald
Dahl
scratched
out
some
of
his
best
ideas
onto
dusty
car
windows.
This
professores
knowledge
about
the
process
of
writing
seemed
to
be,
much
like
his
charisma,
grounded
merely
in
facades:
the
appearance
of
writing,
as
opposed
to
the
magic
of
the
act.
If
only
writing
were
as
simple
as
purchasing
a
pen.
It
seemed
that
I
had
lost
what
had,
12
years
ago,
attracted
the
awe
of
my
play-dough
obsessed
peers.
Now,
I
stared
at
assignments
and
felt
my
heart
race,
an
anxious
thump
that
persisted
as
I
spent
hours
on
end
pounding
sentences
into
my
keyboard,
erasing
them,
and
sputtering
out
new
ones.
My
head
was
brimming
with
ideas,
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
seep
onto
the
computer
screen
in
essay
form.
Rejections
from
both
a
Writing
Associate
interview
and
the
college
I
tried
to
transfer
to
did
not
help
my
lack
of
confidence.
In
my
English
classes,
my
best
efforts
rarely
yielded
anything
beyond
a
B+.
vListen,
Jenny.
Your
writing
is
good,
how
you
phrase
things,
ites
good,g
said
another
English
professor.
His
speech
was
usually
hurried,
the
words
rapidly
dispatched
onto
whomever
happened
to
be
listening.
This
professor
would
never
dream
of
lecturing
about
sexy
pens,
could
not
even
locate
his
mass-purchased
Bics
beneath
the
papers
that
littered
his
office.
His
was
an
opinion
that
I
both
trusted
and
admired.
vThen
why
did
you
give
me
a
B+?g
vThe
way
you
convey
your
ideas,
the
organization
could
use
some
work.
Ites
almost
like
you
tried
to
compile
the
designated
articles
into
one
dmaster
theoryebrather
than
form
your
own
argument
about
Conrades
text,
and
then
use
the
articles.g
He
discovered
a
pen
in
the
cluttered
crevices
of
his
desk,
and
tugged
at
absentmindedly.
vBut
therees
nothing
wrong
with
a
B+!
Youere
a
freshman;
you
shouldnet
be
so
hard
on
yourself,
youere
too
hard
on
yourself.g
The
pen
exploded
in
his
hands,
and
he
threw
it
against
the
desk
in
frustration.
I
listened
to
what
my
professor
had
to
say
about
my
organizational
problems,
but
did
not
cease
to
be
hard
on
myself
for
having
them.
I
took
all
of
the
shortcomings,
the
B+es
and
the
rejections,
as
evidence
of
my
inability
to
write.
Still,
I
continued
pursue
writing-oriented
interests,
simply
because
I
had
no
other
way
of
answering
questions
that
eluded
me.
For
example,
in
my
sophomore
year
I
decided
to
turn
a
personal
curiosity
into
an
independent
study
about
how
neurological
disorders
like
epilepsy
might
influence
the
writing
process.
At
first,
the
independent
study
seemed
like
a
good
idea.
But
as
I
learned,
conveying
my
ideas
was
far
more
difficult
than
coming
up
with
them
in
the
first
place.
Despite
my
relentless
efforts,
the
written
version
of
my
independent
study
was
far
from
desirable.
In
retrospect,
there
were
extenuating
circumstances;
however,
I
overlooked
them.
Feeling
defeated,
I
reminded
myself
of
my
kindergarten
teacheres
concern
so
many
years
ago.
In
order
to
remedy
my
writing
woes,
I
had
to
revert
back
to
my
original
relationship
with
words.
Perhaps
my
love
for
writing
did
not
begin
when
I
came
out
of
the
womb,
but
it
was
certainly
with
me
long
before
my
kindergarten
teacheres
harsh
comments.
I
had
spent
years
ignoring
the
strengths
in
my
writing,
focusing
only
on
uncovering
flaws,
sometimes
before
the
words
were
even
written.
I
had
to
abandon
my
inner
criticism,
focusing
instead
on
constructing
sentences
for
their
own
sake.
So
I
started
writing
stories.
Not
for
my
teachers,
not
for
my
peers,
but
stories
simply
for
their
own
sake.
Some
of
the
stories
dealt
with
the
reasons
I
had
detracted
from
writing
in
the
first
place.
I
wish
all
of
this
culminated
in
a
redemptive
ending,
wherein
I
emerge
from
my
past
inspired,
prolific,
and
completely
confident.
True,
I
am
doing
things
I
never
could
have
done
beforebwriting
a
creative
nonfiction
thesis,
become
a
writing
associate.
But
I
still
have
trouble
writing,
and
I
still
respond
to
challenging
assignments
with
no
small
degree
of
anxiety.
What
is
different
now
is
that
even
if
it
takes
extended
periods
of
staring
at
blank
screens
and
pacing
my
room
in
frustration,
there
comes
a
moment
when
I
can
focus
only
on
the
writing,
the
mechanism
by
which
I
can
take
my
thoughts
and
turn
them
into
something
tangible,
something
that
others
can
understand.
If
I
have
done
thisbwhether
Iem
writing
my
next
paper,
or
my
honors
thesis,
or
my
shopping
listbIem
not
so
concerned
a
work
that
bears
the
pristine
stamp
of
vPerfection.g
From
Little
Rabbit
to
the
shifting
order
in
Chauceres
The
Knightes
Tale,
I
have
been
fascinated
by
how
I
can
use
my
writing
in
order
to
create
tangible
meaning
out
of
what
would
otherwise
be
a
jumbled
mess
of
letters
and
words.
Only
when
I
embraced
the
uniqueness
of
my
writingband
by
extension,
myselfbwas
I
able
to
recognize
the
power
of
my
words.
Such
words
are
always
influenced
by
others,
but
they
are
no
longer
defined
by
them.
What
I
ultimately
realized
was
that,
even
if
the
dJe
is
slightly
backwards,
the
final
product
still
reads
like
