My
Literacy
Narrative:
Memories
of
a
Writer-In-Training
My
background
as
a
writer
actually
starts
out
with
my
parents.
My
father
was
and
is
a
history
buff,
especially
when
it
comes
to
the
American
Civil
War,
and
ever
since
I
could
remember,
my
family
would
participate
in
many
civil
war
reenactments.
It
was
here,
on
the
battlefield
so
to
say,
where
my
father
played
a
corporal
in
the
3rd
New
Jersey
reenactment
group,
and
my
mother,
my
brother,
sister,
and
I
would
assist
him
in
many
living
history
events,
that
my
desire
to
become
a
writer
was
birthed.
My
family
started
reenacting
when
I
was
three,
and
so
my
imagination
from
a
very
early
age
was
constantly
focused
on
setting,
on
seeing
the
rolling
plains
and
historic
towns
of
the
civil
war
battlefields
and
being
able
to
process
what
I
saw
and
record
it
on
paper.
On
top
of
the
occasional
reenactment,
my
mother
was
always
reading
to
me,
and
she
also
encouraged
me
to
listen
to
what
she
was
saying
and
to
let
my
imagination
take
what
she
was
reading
and
translate
that
story
into
my
own
little
slideshow
in
my
mind.
By
the
time
I
started
elementary
school
and
was
learning
about
vocabulary
and
phonics
in
my
language
arts
classes,
I
was
inspired
to
start
writing
my
own
little
story
in
conjunction
with
what
I
was
reading
at
the
time.
My
earliest
writing
memory
goes
back
to
when
I
was
six
years
old.
At
the
time,
I
was
a
huge
Hardy
Boys
book
series
enthusiast,
and
because
of
those
stories,
I
fell
in
love
with
the
suspense/mystery
genre
of
novels.
I
was
inspired
by
those
books
to
write
my
own
mystery
piece.
I
called
it
The
Case
of
the
Underground
Cave,
and
it
was
based
generally
along
the
same
basic
plotline
as
the
Hardy
Boys
books.
Looking
back,
that
was
the
first
time
where
I
attempted
to
put
together
character
sketches,
themes,
and
a
storyline
2
all
into
one
piece
of
literature.
My
world
at
the
age
of
five
included
my
house,
the
street
in
which
my
house
was
on,
and
my
Christian
school
about
ten
minutes
down
the
road
from
in
my
home
town
of
Washington.
This
early
work
of
mine
blended
elements
of
all
three
parts
of
my
world
into
a
basic
story;
my
closest
friends
from
both
my
street
and
school
were
main
characters
in
the
story,
I
based
a
lot
of
my
description
of
the
cave
on
a
cavern
near
my
house
that
my
companions
and
I
visited
to
celebrate
my
best
friendOs
birthday
party,
and
the
beginning
setting
of
my
story
(set
on
the
beach)
was
based
on
pictures
in
my
home
of
my
motherOs
extended
family
enjoying
the
Jersey
boardwalk
and
shore.
(In
the
story,
as
the
main
characters
are
exploring
the
shore
for
the
first
time,
they
stumble
on
the
entrance
to
a
cave
underneath
the
wooden
planks
in
a
more
remote
part
of
the
boardwalk).
In
short,
my
first
writing
piece
could
be
classified
as
a
mystery
short
story,
a
culmination
of
all
my
childhood
memories
at
that
tender
age.
This
was
also
the
first
piece
where
I
started
developing
my
style,
or
what
future
teachers
and
future
fellow
students
would
call
my
Ndescriptive,
flowery
styleO
of
writing.
I
simply
loved
description!
I
loved
painting
pictures
with
my
pen;
I
wanted
the
reader
to
see
what
was
exactly
going
on
in
my
imagination
as
I
was
writing
this
mystery
story,
so
I
made
sure
to
describe
absolutely
everything
I
could
think
of
in
this
subterranean
mystery
work,
despite
the
fact
that
my
vocabulary
was
still
lacking
and
that
a
lot
of
kinks
had
to
be
worked
out
in
my
writing.
Thankfully,
in
the
elementary
school
I
went
to,
named
Good
Shepherd
Christian
Academy,
my
teachers
consistently
emphasized
vocabulary,
word
placement,
spelling,
and
the
significance
of
words
and
their
functions
via
the
process
of
diagramming
3
sentences,
and
out
of
this
constant
exposure
to
the
structure
of
sentences,
I
looked
forward
to
doing
more
creative
works
similar
to
my
unfinished
mystery
story
(except
without
the
NunfinishedO
part)
using
these
newfound
grammatical
and
linguistic
tools
from
class.
However,
creative
writing
took
a
backseat
for
the
next
several
years,
both
outside
the
classroom
with
my
last
work
being
that
unfinished
mystery
story
(independent
from
any
classroom
assignments)
and
inside
the
classroom
(no
creative
genre
writing
assignments
assigned
as
of
yet),
since
my
teachers
continued
to
feed
the
other
students
and
I
a
steady
diet
of
sentence
structure,
vocabulary,
spelling
and
other
basic
food
groups
of
language.
But
the
lack
of
creative
writing
exercises
both
in
and
out
of
school
was
made
up
for
in
part
by
an
introduction
to
the
NargumentO
genre
of
writing.
I
was
first
exposed
to
this
NargumentO
genre
of
writing
when
I
was
eight
years
old.
But
while
I
found
creative
writing
so
enjoyable
because
I
felt
so
free
to
write
about
nearly
anything
I
wanted
and
I
felt
that
my
writing
style
could
be
developed
so
much
more
through
that
medium
of
writing,
argumentative
writing
and
I
Nbutted
headsO
a
lot
more
with
each
other,
or
as
I
once
said
jokingly
to
my
parents
after
coming
home
from
school
one
day:
NToday
was
the
beginning
of
a
love-hate
relationship
between
argumentative
writing
and
me.O
While
I
loved
writing
and
relished
the
challenge
of
penning
what
seemed
so
clear
in
my
mind
(at
least
other
than
those
times
where
everything
seemed
so
cloudy
in
my
imagination
that
I
could
not
even
decipher
what
NitO
was
that
I
wanted
to
write),
I
hated
the
fact
that
there
were
stricter
boundaries
in
argumentative
writing!
As
my
teacher
4
explained
the
necessity
of
thinking
about
the
fundamental
Nwho,O
Nwhat,O
Nwhy,O
and
NhowO
questions
in
approaching
such
a
genre,
I
would
sit
there
thinking
to
myself:
NSo
when
can
I
write
about
suspense
and
espionage
or
about
my
own
Force-sensitive
beings
in
the
Star
Wars
universe?O
My
eight-year
old
self
was
still
totally
enthralled
by
the
prospect
of
creative
writing
as
a
response
to
what
I
was
reading
(which
was
still
predominately
suspense
but
now
mixed
in
with
science
fantasy)
and
then
using
creative
writing
as
a
springboard
from
which
I
could
develop
my
own
characters
and
expound
on
the
storylines
I
was
reading.
In
hindsight,
I
did
not
understand
the
fact
that
the
same
thing
was
done
in
argumentative
writing,
that
argumentative
writing
was
also
a
response
to
that
which
I
was
reading,
and
that
argument
writing
was
the
venue
in
which
I
could
write
down
why
I
disagreed
with
the
authorOs
stance
on
an
issue
or
could
be
used
as
a
way
of
qualifying
what
the
author
said.
By
the
time
I
was
eleven
years
old,
creative
writing
once
again
came
to
the
forefront
but
now
it
shared
the
spotlight
with
argumentative
writing.
This
was
the
age
at
which
I
started
doing
a
lot
of
book
reports
(though
I
did
write
a
few
in
early
elementary
school),
and
through
these
assignments,
I
was
able
to
combine
the
elements
of
argument
and
creative
writing
genres
into
a
piece
of
work.
At
the
time,
I
was
reading
the
Left
Behind
Christian
fiction
series,
and
by
doing
book
reports
on
these
treasured
novels,
I
gained
a
better
appreciation
for
the
process
of
combining
what
was
good
with
the
argument
genre
of
writing
with
the
good
of
the
creative
writing
genre.
In
other
words,
the
Nlove-hateO
relationship
I
had
with
the
argument
genre
gave
way
to
an
appreciatory
relationship
with
the
genre
as
I
reached
the
point
in
school
where
my
5
teachers
challenged
me
to
stop
separating
one
genre
from
the
other
when
it
came
to
writing
analytical
pieces,
such
as
these
book
reports.
In
addition,
this
was
the
age
where
I
really
started
using
the
computer
a
lot
more,
while
shying
away
from
the
traditional
pen
and
paper.
I
felt
that,
with
a
computer,
there
was
more
freedom
to
let
my
thoughts
turn
into
some
sort
of
collective
story,
whereas
with
pen
and
paper
I
felt
that
a
lot
of
times
I
was
forcing
a
story
into
reality
instead
of
letting
my
thoughts
come
together
on
their
own
terms.
My
adjustment
to
computers
paralleled
my
further
adjustment
to
the
argumentative
genre.
Yet
sure
enough,
as
I
adjusted
more
and
more
to
the
argument
genre,
the
creative
writing
genre
took
on
a
different
look
for
me.
This
change
in
the
creative
writing
genre
paralleled
my
changing
of
schools.
From
first
to
seventh
grade,
I
went
to
a
private,
Christian
school,
and
then
by
eighth
grade,
I
was
enrolled
in
the
public
middle
school
to
help
with
the
transition
to
high
school.
In
my
eighth
grade
English
class,
I
was
almost
NreintroducedO
to
the
other
side
of
creative
writing.
Journals
and
freewriting
were
somewhat
familiar
to
me
because
I
was
told
of
them
in
passing
in
elementary
school,
but
I
really
did
not
get
my
hands
involved
in
that
sort
of
writing
until
this
eighth
grade
English
class.
And
we
did
a
lot
of
freewriting
in
my
English
class!
Nearly
every
single
day,
my
class
would
spend
about
ten
minutes
of
our
time
devoted
solely
to
freewriting,
and
ironically,
I
found
this
type
of
creative
writing
harder
to
master
than
I
thought
it
would
be
because
after
about
five
minutes,
I
would
run
out
of
things
to
write
about.
All
the
time
spent
on
freewriting
in
eighth
grade
was
evened
out
by
the
absence
of
time
spent
on
it
freshman
year
of
high
school.
My
English
teacher
freshman
year
6
emphasized
the
short
story
aspect
of
creative
writing,
which
was
very
exciting
for
me
because
I
was
returning
to
the
very
same
writing
that
I
started
out
with
so
many
years
ago
when
I
was
five.
At
the
time,
I
was
reading
the
Lord
of
the
Rings
trilogy
as
part
of
my
pleasure-reading
list
of
material,
and
I
was
inspired
from
reading
these
works
to
write
my
own
fantasy
short
story.
What
culminated
as
a
result
of
my
fascination
with
TolkienOs
works
was
a
story
titled
The
King
and
the
Dream.
Writing
that
story
was
one
of
the
best
experiences
of
my
writing
career,
not
only
because
I
received
a
very
high
grade
on
it,
but
also
because
it
was
a
finished
product
that
was
more
monumental
in
scope
than
a
book
report
or
a
page
or
two
of
freewriting.
The
completion
of
this
short
story
was
truly
a
milestone
in
my
writing
career
because
I
felt
that
through
this
story,
my
writing
was
finally
Ncoming
of
age,O
in
the
sense
in
that
I
was
able
to
take
what
was
learned
about
writing
in
all
of
its
genres
and
really
develop
a
sizable
piece
of
literature
with
what
I
was
taught.
Furthermore,
my
writing
style
Ncame
of
ageO
through
this
story
because
the
scope
of
the
assignment
allowed
for
me
to
be
very
descriptive
and
to
paint
the
setting
of
the
story
from
my
mind
onto
the
paper.
I
carried
this
newfound
enthusiasm
for
writing
into
my
junior
year,
which
was
when
I
took
my
very
first
Advanced
Placement
English
class.
Titled
NEnglish
Language
and
Composition,O
the
class
allowed
for
us
as
students
to
continue
to
develop
our
own
unique
styles
of
writing
in
the
context
of
responding
to
the
styles
of
famous
writers.
While
the
larger,
take-home
assignments
were
tailored
to
my
style,
and
I
was
for
the
first
time
doing
scholarly
level
research
papers
in
this
class,
some
of
my
worst
experiences
as
a
writer
also
occurred
in
this
class
in
the
context
of
timed
essays.
In
preparing
for
the
7
May
exam,
my
teacher
had
us
do
timed
essays
about
once
to
twice
a
week,
and
though
I
did
these
kind
of
essays
throughout
my
writing
career,
I
struggled
with
that
part
of
the
class
because
at
this
point,
my
descriptive,
flowery
style
of
writing
solidified,
and
I
had
a
hard
time
toning
that
down
and
getting
to
the
point
in
what
I
was
writing,
often
times
resulting
in
running
out
of
time
and
my
paper
being
unfinished.
In
other
words,
the
essay
was
not
what
I
had
trouble
with
so
much
as
it
was
the
NtimedO
part.
I
preferred
to
have
the
kind
of
assignment
where
I
could
write
a
larger
essay
and
allow
my
style
to
take
its
course.
Yet
the
experience
of
dealing
with
this
kind
of
essay
writing
prepared
me
very
well
for
senior
year
and
then
for
college.
In
my
English
Language
and
Literature
course
senior
year,
my
teacher
emphasized
the
Ngetting
in
and
going
outO
policy,
of
writing
cogently
and
succinctly
in
a
fixed
amount
of
time,
of
diving
into
the
prompt,
making
the
point
and
backing
it
up
with
evidence,
and
then
getting
out
and
concluding
my
reasoning.
Because
of
my
struggles
with
this
kind
of
timed
writing
the
previous
year,
I
was
prepared
the
second
time
around.
In
addition,
my
senior
year
English
teacher
also
happened
to
be
the
same
one
who
I
had
for
freshman
year,
and
she
made
a
point
in
challenging
me
to
continue
to
work
on
gaining
a
better
grasp
of
sticking
to
the
point
of
the
prompt
and
not
overwhelming
the
reader
with
an
overly
flowery
style
of
writing,
although
she
considered
to
encourage
me
to
develop
my
own
unique
style
of
writing
in
the
context
of
whatever
the
assignment
was
that
we
had
to
do.
By
the
time
I
entered
my
freshman
year
seminar
at
Lafayette,
I
was
well
acquainted
with
this
Ngetting
in
and
going
outO
policy
and
I
had
the
practice
in
high
8
school
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
writing.
All
of
the
analytical,
scholarly
papers
my
professor
assigned
throughout
the
seminar
dealt
precisely
with
this
policy.
I
was
also
familiar
with
creative
writing
approaches,
and
my
English
classes
freshman
year
of
college
allowed
me
to
experiment
with
the
creative
writing
genres
I
learned
about
and
was
exposed
not
only
from
high
school,
but
also
from
elementary
school.
Looking
back
on
my
writing
career,
perhaps
my
worst
experience
as
a
writer
has
not
been
so
much
a
specific
paper
(although
I
have
gotten
some
pretty
bad
grades),
but
rather
my
worst
experience
has
thus
far
been
in
starting
a
paper!
From
when
I
first
started
writing
the
Case
of
the
Underground
Cave
back
when
I
five
years
old
up
to
the
latest
essays
I
wrote
in
college,
the
worst
part
of
it
all
is
starting
the
paper.
Many,
many
times,
I
would
just
stare
at
the
computer
screen
or
stare
at
the
notebook
for
a
good
thirty
to
thirty
five
minutes
(with
some
occasional
writing
here
and
there
but
the
sort
of
convoluted
writing
that
does
not
really
start
a
paper),
then
step
away
from
the
project
to
let
my
mind
process
what
it
is
that
I
want
to
say,
and
then
go
back
to
the
computer
or
to
the
notebook
and
write
maybe
one
line,
only
to
scribble
it
out
and
write
another
one!
I
try
to
be
so
perfect
in
writing
that
first
line
that
I
end
up
repeating
this
vicious
process
over
and
over
again!
Yet
through
all
the
struggles
and
heartaches
that
come
with
writing,
especially
starting
the
process,
there
is
much
joy
to
be
received
from
putting
thoughts
onto
paper
and
seeing
those
thoughts
of
the
imagination
bear
fruit
in
oneOs
very
own
piece
of
literature.
