"Writing
as
a
WA"
Project
for
Workshop
August
16,
2002
At
the
start
of
my
sophomore
year
at
Lafayette,
I
thought
my
writing
had
reached
a
plateau.
I
had
experimented
with
different
genres
of
writing
during
my
freshman
year,
earned
A's
on
my
papers,
and
professors
seemed
pleased
with
my
writing.
This
caused
an
inflation
of
my
perception
of
my
abilities
to
communicate
through
writing
that
came
to
a
sudden
end
when
my
Fall
semester
Government
and
Law
professor
handed
out
the
first
writing
assignment.
The
paper
was
like
nothing
I
had
been
assigned
before,
asking
abstract
questions
like
"What
is
justice?,"
What
is
fairness?,"
and
"What
is
equality?"
As
I
have
never
been
fond
of
philosophy,
this
task
was
a
great
challenge.
At
first,
it
seemed
to
me
the
paper
would
read
like
a
dictionary
-
as
it
was
virtually
impossible
to
define
one
term
without
using
another
that
was
just
as
abstract.
Without
a
doubt,
my
freshman-year-tested
ritual
of
feverishly
writing
an
assignment
the
night
before
it
was
due
would
not
succeed,
as
I
knew
this
paper
would
require
much
rewriting,
revising,
and
even
consulting
friends,
family,
and
Writing
Associates
for
their
advice.
My
Fall
Break
was
dedicated
to
researching
and
drafting
the
paper,
hoping
to
have
it
finished
by
the
time
I
returned
to
Lafayette.
While
I
managed
to
formulate
a
working
draft,
it
was
clear
the
paper
still
required
more
revising.
After
meeting
with
the
professor
and
classmates
and
incorporating
some
of
their
suggestions,
I
submitted
a
piece
of
writing
I
was
confident
was
sure
to
fail.
This
feeling
did
not
change
when
the
papers
where
returned
and
mine
was
covered
with
red
ink.
To
my
surprise,
however,
when
I
reached
the
last
page
of
comments
I
saw
an
"A"
marked
as
my
grade.
It
was
then
I
that
realized
that
even
great
pieces
of
writing
could
benefit
from
suggestions
of
skilled
readers
and
more
revisions.
Throughout
the
year
I
continued
to
learn
more
about
the
research
tools
available
to
Lafayette
students
both
in
Skillman
Library
and
online.
I
had
little
use
for
search
engines
like
Lexis-Nexis
and
J-Stor
during
my
freshman
year,
but
my
reliance
on
these
resources
increased
dramatically
over
the
past
year.
In
many
of
my
Government
and
Law
classes,
I
was
often
asked
to
write
argumentative
essays,
incorporating
all
sides
of
a
particular
issue.
Because
I
was
rarely
familiar
with
any
of
the
given
topics,
I
relied
on
the
search
engines
to
provide
me
with
articles
and
essays
from
authors
with
varying
opinions.
During
the
second
semester
of
my
sophomore
year,
I
took
a
Government
and
Law
class
that
required
mostly
argumentative
essays.
Because
I
had
written
in
this
style
so
many
times
before,
I
was
confident
in
my
ability
to
succeed
in
the
course.
Unlike
most
other
professors
I
had
written
for,
however,
this
professor
demanded
that
each
claim
made
was
supported
by
concrete
evidence.
Moreover,
the
writer
had
to
present
every
side
of
the
issue
presented
rather
than
only
arguing
the
angle
he
or
she
agreed
with.
This
process
forced
me
to
reevaluate
my
opinions
on
a
few
controversial
issues,
resulting
even
in
changing
my
views.
Over
the
past
year,
my
writing
improved
not
only
because
of
works
I
produced,
but
also
from
working
as
a
Writing
Associate
and
learning
from
the
writing
of
my
peers.
Assigned
to
a
Spanish
211
course
for
my
first
semester
as
a
Writing
Associate,
I
was
at
first
apprehensive
about
how
I
would
be
an
effective
WA
for
a
foreign
language
course.
My
background
as
a
Spanish
major
proved
helpful,
as
I
was
not
worried
about
understanding
the
language
and,
having
previously
taken
the
same
course
with
the
same
professor,
I
could
better
relate
to
the
frustrations
the
writers
encountered.
The
most
challenging
part
of
my
job
was
to
adapt
the
traditional
roles
of
the
Writing
Associate
to
fit
a
class
that
was
seemingly
different
from
those
of
my
colleagues.
As
Writing
Associates,
we
are
trained
to
focus
not
on
one
aspect
of
a
piece
of
writing,
but
on
the
paper
as
a
whole
--
unless
otherwise
indicated
by
the
writer.
I
found
this
task
difficult
to
fulfill
because
many
of
the
students
were
insecure
about
their
abilities
to
write
in
a
foreign
language.
Moreover,
it
was
often
a
challenge
for
me
to
understand
the
writing
of
a
few
less-experienced
students
of
Spanish.
In
order
to
overcome
this
barrier,
it
was
necessary
in
several
of
the
conferences
to
suggest
grammar
and
vocabulary
modifications.
Unfortunately,
a
few
of
the
students
viewed
me
as
more
of
a
Spanish
tutor
than
a
peer
reviewer
of
their
writing.
In
a
meeting
with
the
professor,
we
discussed
my
duties
as
a
Writing
Associate
and
she
reiterated
them
to
the
writers.
I
found
informing
the
professor
of
my
concerns
to
be
a
simple
and
effective
way
to
overcome
my
frustrations.
When
students
repeatedly
failed
to
schedule
or
attend
conferences,
I
was
sure
to
advise
the
professor
rather
than
attempting
to
deal
with
an
uncooperative
writer.
My
most
successful
conferences
occurred
when
I
was
given
the
opportunity
to
read
the
drafts
in
advance
of
our
meeting
and
to
formulate
topics
that
I
wanted
to
discuss.
I
encouraged
the
writers
to
do
the
same,
soon
discovering
that
productive
meetings
arose
from
contributions
of
both
the
writer
and
the
Writing
Associate.
Many
of
my
fellow
WA's
preferred
to
review
drafts
at
the
conference;
however,
because
the
writing
I
read
was
in
Spanish,
I
preferred
to
prepare
in
advance
and
make
notes
in
the
margins.
After
working
as
a
WA,
I
became
more
critical
of
my
own
writing.
Through
training,
workshops,
staff
meetings,
and
conferences
with
other
students,
I
realized
that
revising
drafts
was
vital
to
the
success
of
the
final
piece
of
writing.
After
being
hired
as
a
WA
I
felt
professors
would
expect
my
grammar
to
be
flawless
and
my
ideas
coherent,
organized,
and
clearly
expressed
with
precise
diction.
While
much
of
this
pressure
to
create
the
"perfect"
piece
of
writing
was
self-imposed,
it
forced
me
to
dedicate
hours
to
repeatedly
revise
and
rewrite
portions
of
my
essays.
In
fact,
since
I
started
working
as
a
Writing
Associate,
I
have
not
submitted
a
single
paper
that
has
not
undergone
multiple
revisions.
Surprisingly,
expectations
of
my
writing
abilities
more
often
cam
from
peers
than
from
professors.
Several
friends
and
classmates
(and
even
my
family)
have
asked
me
to
read
their
writing
and
make
suggestions
after
discovering
I
was
a
WA.
Although
some
may
think
this
would
make
me
more
confident
of
my
abilities,
it
had
somewhat
of
a
reverse
effect.
Since
I
never
thought
of
my
writing
as
anything
spectacular,
I
was
initially
leery
of
suggesting
changes
to
their
work.
I
gradually
gained
more
confidence
and
learned
it
was
not
my
ability
to
write
but
my
willingness
and
training
in
discussing
writing
that
compelled
them
to
share
their
papers
with
me.
From
the
time
I
started
to
write
I
have
asked
my
parents
to
read
my
essays
and
include
suggestions
on
how
I
could
improve
my
work.
Even
though
I
have
since
become
a
trained
reviewer
of
writing,
I
continue
to
email
them
my
papers
and
talk
to
them
about
possible
changes.
I
accredit
this
process
with
making
me
comfortable
with
seeking
out
advice
and
critiques
of
my
writing.
Many
students
are
protective
of
their
writing
and
often
fear
the
reaction
of
readers,
but
I
was
never
this
sort
of
writer.
This
year,
I
began
to
consult
more
frequently
with
Writing
Associates
(many
of
whom
were
my
friends)
on
my
own
papers.
While
many
students
are
extremely
nervous
about
letting
friends
read
their
papers
I
have
always
found
my
peers
to
be
a
reliable
source
of
honest
advice.
There
was
never
a
need
to
establish
authority
in
any
of
my
conferences
with
other
WA's,
as
we
both
knew
what
the
role
of
the
WA
was
and
were
able
to
bring
helpful
insight
to
the
discussion.
This
summer,
I
worked
as
an
intern
for
the
National
Right
to
Work
Committee
in
Washington,
D.C.
and
gained
experience
writing
inter-office
memorandums,
letters
to
members
of
the
Committee,
and
doing
political
research.
These
tasks
forced
me
to
apply
my
academic
training
to
a
"real
world"
setting.
I
quickly
learned
that
in
a
political
office,
elaborate
diction,
style,
and
descriptions
are
not
necessary;
rather,
precision
is
valued.
The
rapidly
changing,
cutthroat
world
of
politics
demands
writing
that
is
accurate
and
succinct.
Most
importantly,
I
learned
that
researching
facts
and
keeping
myself
apprised
of
on
current
events
(such
as
Congressional
Committee
votes,
cosponsors
of
particular
bill,
and
candidates
running
for
office)
is
crucial
to
a
political
writer's
success.
My
training
as
a
Writing
Associate
also
came
to
use
at
the
Committee,
as
part
of
my
job
was
to
proofread
my
colleagues'
writing.
The
reviewing
process
was
much
different,
however,
as
there
were
no
conferences
between
writers.
Rather,
the
writer
submitted
his
or
her
work
for
proofing,
and
it
was
returned
with
corrections
made
by
the
editor.
The
most
valuable
advice
I
have
to
share
with
new
Writing
Associates
is
that
students
don't
expect
us
to
know
everything
about
writing;
most
of
the
time
they
appreciate
having
a
second
opinion
before
submitting
their
work
to
the
professor.
Moreover,
I
found
my
most
successful
conferences
occurred
when
we
discussed
the
paper
as
a
whole,
instead
of
picking
apart
individual
sections.
Also,
ask
the
writers
to
come
with
a
few
questions
or
conversation
topics
for
the
conference.
This
way,
you
will
be
sure
to
discuss
areas
of
most
concern
to
the
writer.
Every
WA
will
encounter
a
few
writers
who
don't
schedule
conferences,
don't
come
prepared,
or
refuse
to
talk.
After
fruitlessly
trying
to
make
all
of
the
writers
cooperate,
I
found
that
notifying
the
professor
of
each
writer's
progress
was
the
best
way
to
handle
such
situations.
Although
many
professors
do
not
require
students
to
meet
with
the
assigned
WA,
they
appreciate
knowing
how
their
class
is
reacting
to
the
assignment
and
cooperating
with
the
Writing
Associate.
Finally,
do
not
underestimate
the
volume
of
work
you
will
have
as
a
Writing
Associate.
WA's
put
in
many
more
hours
than
students
see
at
the
conference.
Reading
papers,
attending
staff
meetings
and
completing
the
assigned
reading
and
presentations,
scheduling
conferences,
and
meeting
with
professors
are
all
duties
Writing
Associate's
have
that
require
time
and
organization.
Most
importantly,
remember
that
there
are
people
who
are
willing
to
help
out
if
you
feel
overwhelmed.
WA
work
is
demanding,
but
at
the
end
of
the
year
I
found
my
writing,
communication
and
organization
skills
improved,
and
I
accredit
much
of
this
to
my
experience
as
a
Writing
Associate.
