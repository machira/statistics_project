Literacy
Narrative
Writing
began,
for
me,
as
just
another
physical
exercise.
Learning
to
form
letters,
words,
sentences
and
eventually
complete
works
was
just
another
task
at
school,
no
more
useful
than
math
facts
or
geography.
Writing,
in
the
beginning,
was
just
copying
words
or
simple
sentences
and
was
at
best
tedious,
at
worst
mind-numbing.
It
would
be
sometime
before
I
saw
writing
as
a
means
of
storing
my
thoughts
long-term,
or,
even
more
useful,
a
unique
form
of
self-expression.
Kindergarten
and
grade
school
were,
for
me,
more
about
learning
to
properly
socialize
with
other
students
than
actually
performing
in
school.
This
meant
that
penmanship
practice
quickly
degraded
into
chatting,
and
writing
exercises
not
closely
monitored
by
the
teacher
inevitably
were
neglected
or
even
ignored.
Perhaps
somewhat
counter
intuitively,
despite
my
obvious
lack
of
interest
in
writing,
my
grasp
of
language
did
not
fall
behind
like
so
many
of
my
similarly
dispositioned
peersO.
I
can
only
attribute
this
to
my
love
of
reading.
It
really
does
seem
weird
that
I
would
enjoy
other
peopleOs
writing
to
the
point
that
my
mother
would
have
to
hide
my
books
so
I
would
sleep,
but
dislike
writing
anything
myself
enough
that
I
would
rather
be
reprimanded
at
school
than
produce
practice
sentences.
Thankfully,
reading
as
much
as
I
did
allowed
me
develop
a
normal
vocabulary
and
an
adequate
grasp
of
language
structure
despite
avoiding
schoolwork
at
all
costs.
Of
course,
grade
school
hardly
seems
like
real
writing
in
hindsight.
Practicing
simple
sentences
and
studying
spelling
words
now
seems
so
easy
that
I
wonder
why
I
went
to
such
great
lengths
to
avoid
it.
Especially
now
that
I
can
see
the
consequences
of
my
dislike
for
writing
practice,
I
regret
some
of
my
decisions.
My
penmanship
is
illegible
to
even
the
most
practiced
of
doctors,
and
my
spelling
ability
is
absolutely
atrocious.
Thankfully,
middle
school
would
bring
a
much-desired
change.
The
transition
from
grade
school
to
middle
school
was
quite
interesting
for
me.
Going
from
fifth
grade,
and
being
the
big
kid
on
the
block,
to
sixth
grade,
and
once
again
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder,
all
in
the
space
of
a
summer
was
quite
disconcerting.
However,
the
schoolwork
became
much
more
stimulating.
Basic
math
operations
transitioned
to
geometry,
reading
short
stories
together
in
class,
although
not
entirely
done
away
with,
was
now
accompanied
by
novels
we
were
to
read
at
home
and
discuss
over
the
following
weeks,
and
writing
in
class
was
no
longer
just
physical
practice
of
the
skill.
Copying
and
recopying
were
things
of
the
past,
never
again
was
I
to
hear
about
practicing
my
letters,
or
opening
my
phonics
book.
Writing
now
meant
5-paragraph
essays
and
long
responses
to
test
questions.
It
was
finally
interesting.
And
although
spelling
tests
would
plague
me
long
into
the
future,
writing
had
lost
much
of
its
tedium
and
all
of
its
monotony.
I
remember
the
prompt
for
the
first
5-paragraph
essay
I
ever
wrote
was
about
a
vacation
we
had
taken
the
previous
summer.
That
year
I
had
gone
on
a
fishing
trip
in
Canada
with
all
the
male
members
of
my
extended
family.
Not
only
did
I
have
a
topic,
I
had
a
topic
I
genuinely
cared
about.
Because
I
finally
found
the
task
interesting,
I
put
in
effort
beyond
what
was
required
for
the
grade,
and
I
found
that
writing
was
much
more
involved
skill
than
I
had
previously
thought.
You
could
achieve
depth
far
beyond
what
speech
along
offered.
Throughout
the
beginning
of
middle
school,
I
was
fascinated
by
my
ability
to
really
say
exactly
what
I
meant
and
felt
through
writing
because
I
actually
had
time
to
think
about
what
would
have
come
out
of
my
mouth,
but
was
instead
going
through
my
hand
and
onto
the
page.
Middle
school
was
also
my
first
introduction
to
the
use
of
a
computer
as
a
writing
aid.
I
thought
this
was
fantastic
because
it
alleviated
all
the
remaining
problems
I
had
with
writing.
Even
in
2006
spell
check
programs
were
more
than
adequate
for
the
types
of
writing
and
I
was
doing,
and
no
one
could
complain
about
my
penmanship
if
I
instead
chose
to
type.
The
computer,
for
me,
is
the
ultimate
writing
tool.
The
Internet
provides
access
to
all
the
research
information
you
could
ever
require
and
typing
is
infinitely
simpler
than
writing
by
hand.
Projects
I
was
allowed
to
type
invariably
were
of
higher
quality
than
their
counterparts
would
have
been
had
I
hand
written
them.
Writing
by
hand,
even
if
it
was
about
something
I
was
interested
in,
still
required
a
lot
of
time,
made
mistakes
very
difficult
to
fix,
and
always
resulted
in
hand
ramps.
Typing
was
much
simpler
and
much
more
enjoyable.
High
school
writing
was
another
big
transition.
Instead
of
5-paragraph
essays
and
the
occasional
book
report
I
was
expected
to
write
research
papers,
answer
test
questions
in
essay
format,
and
even
maintain
a
journal.
My
high
school
prided
itself
on
having
an
excellent
writing
program
and
started
us
early.
Ninth
grade
fall
was
spent
working
up
to
writing
papers
greater
than
five
pages
in
length.
Interestingly,
the
transition
to
much
longer
works
was
difficult
but
interesting.
Just
writing
what
came
off
the
top
of
my
head
was
no
longer
enough
to
finish
the
assignment.
Writing
began
to
take
preparation
and
revision.
A
five-page
paper,
especially
about
something
I
wasnOt
already
familiar
with
became
quite
an
exercise
often
requiring
three
drafts
and
an
hour
or
more
of
brainstorming.
I
found
that
the
preparation
required
to
write
well
was
good
practice
for
preparing
to
do
anything
well.
When
writing,
the
difference
between
a
prepared
paper
and
something
that
was
just
thrown
together
is
very
striking.
I
wrote
quite
a
few
of
both
while
in
high
school
and
teachers
were
sure
to
let
me
know
they
could
tell
the
difference.
After
the
fall
of
my
first
year
of
high
school,
my
school
writing
was
limited
to
projects
of
a
month
or
more,
usually
some
kind
of
research
paper,
essay
responses
to
prompts
from
a
book
we
were
reading
in
class,
and
journal
entries
in
an
online
tool
called
Penzu.
Writing
spaced
out
over
long
intervals
My
first
real
research
paper
was
tenth
grade
spring.
I
wrote
about
the
Israeli-Palestinian
conflict
from
IsraelOs
point
of
view.
Overall
it
was
a
bad
experience.
While
the
topic
was
interesting,
it
was
much
too
large
to
be
adequately
covered
by
a
ten
page
research
paper.
It
was
also
a
project
that
involved
a
lot
of
oversight
by
the
instructor.
We
followed
a
very
strict
format
of
how
the
paper
should
be
developed
including
multiple
brainstorming
stages
and
4
drafts
eventually
leading
to
the
fifth
and
final
draft.
This
rigorous
run-up
to
the
final
product
did
not
work
well
for
me
at
all.
I
was
burnt
out
early
in
the
writing
process
and
couldnOt
motivate
myself
to
put
in
the
time
on
my
final
paper.
Although
my
grades
were
fine,
I
was
not
especially
happy
with
my
final
product
and
overall
regretted
how
I
handled
the
process.
Penzu
journal
entries
were
much
the
same
story.
I
did
not
enjoy
them
at
all,
but
for
a
very
different
set
of
reasons.
Creative
writing
has
never
been
to
my
interest,
and
I
feel
awkward
and
artificial
explaining
my
feelings
through
writing.
Journaling
was
something
that
I
dropped
as
soon
as
it
was
no
longer
required
by
my
high
school
classes
and
I
do
not
intend
to
pick
it
up
again.
Writing
in
response
to
a
book
I
was
reading,
however,
was
something
I
enjoyed
very
much.
It
seemed
like
a
simple
way
to
almost
have
a
conversation
with
the
author.
I
also
found
that
writing
down
what
I
was
thinking
about
my
readings
helped
me
to
better
understand
the
more
minute
details
of
the
book.
Because
IOve
been
such
a
fan
of
reading
for
so
long,
IOm
able
to
work
through
most
books
very
quickly.
I
found
that
written
responses
helped
me
to
slow
down
and
really
get
a
feel
for
the
deeper
themes
of
a
book,
beyond
the
superficial
plot
I
was
able
to
follow
while
just
reading
the
book.
It
was
almost
like
writing
down
my
ideas
about
the
book
allowed
me
to
experience
it
the
same
way
I
would
had
I
read
the
book
many
times
over.
Overall
I
think
that
although
my
high
school
writing
program
adequately
prepared
me
for
college,
I
donOt
think
it
did
so
through
proper
design
but
only
through
sheer
volume.
Which,
to
be
fair,
seems
to
me
to
be
a
perfectly
good
way
to
do
it.
If
you
want
to
become
better
at
something,
you
need
to
practice
it,
and
my
high
school
teachers
had
me
practice
a
lot.
Coming
to
college
I
expected
weekly
papers
of
varying
length
about
topics
I
knew
little
or
nothing
about.
I
was
not
entirely
disappointed.
College
writing
has
made
me
very
thankful
for
my
high
school
writing
practices.
Writing
in
college
is
very
much
suited
to
my
style,
and
I
actually
enjoy
most
opportunities
to
write
now.
I
think
that
the
minimal
oversight
professors
provide
helps
me
to
achieve
my
creative
maximum.
I
also
enjoy
that
criticism
and
critique
are
available
to
me,
I
am
not
required
to
follow
them.
I
often
found
that
if
I
did
not
take
my
high
school
instructors
advice
exactly
the
way
they
suggested
I
should
my
grade
suffered.
To
this
point,
that
has
not
been
my
college
experience
at
all.
Truthfully,
I
feel
that
the
college
environment
is
uniquely
suited
to
encouraging
the
creative
process.
Overall,
my
experience
with
writing
has
been
very
closely
linked
with
my
interest
in
reading.
Because
I
enjoy
reading
so
much,
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
becoming
experienced
with
writing.
My
reading
interests
have
exposed
me
to
different
styles
and
methods
of
writing,
and
for
that
I
am
thankful.
Although
I
used
to
see
writing
as
nothing
but
a
chore,
I
now
view
it
as
a
tool.
I
am
not
particularly
interested
in
writing
for
pleasure,
but
I
do
see
that
the
written
word
is
a
very
useful
tool.
Although
learning
to
write
well
takes
a
very
long
time,
I
think
it
is
a
worthwhile
investment.
Whether
in
the
work
place
or
at
school,
being
able
to
write
well
is
a
very
advantageous
skill
to
have.
I
think
many
people
share
my
respect
for
well-written
works
and
the
people
who
produce
them.
Although
IOve
arrived
at
likely
the
final
stage
in
my
schooling,
I
think
that
my
writing
ability
is
something
that
is
definitely
worth
working
to
improve
long
after
IOve
finished
officially
studying.
