The
Writing
Saga
NNo,
Jason,
that
just
looks
like
a
squiggly
Os.O
Turn
it
around
and
put
a
dot
under
it.O
I
focus
intently
on
my
pencil.
I
grip
it
with
all
five
fingers,
much
like
one
would
grip
a
dagger.
Much
like
the
hypothetical
dagger-wielder,
I
too
seek
vengeance.
I
must
do
this
or
I
will
face
unbearable
shame.
Though
my
eyes
are
burning
into
my
neatly
lined
paper
and
my
mind
is
concentrated
on
the
task
at
hand,
I
can
sense
in
my
periphery
my
teacherOs
red
hair
lightly
resting
on
my
shoulder
and
her
perfume
dancing
around
my
nostrils,
taunting
me
and
reminding
me
of
the
time
that
scent
made
me
call
her
NMomO
instead
of
NMrs.
SandersonO
causing
uproarious
laughter
from
the
rest
of
the
children.
I
am
in
third
grade.
I
am
trying
to
master
the
art
of
stenciling
a
question
mark.
So
far
I
have
been
unsuccessful.
I
have
produced
myriad
shapes
which
in
my
opinion
express
inquiry,
but
my
teacher
is
not
satisfied.
I
bring
my
hand
to
the
page
for
one
more
try.
I
curl
my
hand
and
twist
my
wrist
and
craft
a
delightful
bending
line
with
the
lead
from
my
pencil.
I
throw
a
dot
beneath
it
and
snap
my
head
around
to
Mrs.
Sanderson,
waiting
for
her
praise
for
the
most
incredible
question
mark
she
has
ever
seen
produced
by
a
nine-year-old.
NMuch
better,
Jason,O
she
says.
I
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
passionate,
but
I
accept
it.
I
bathe
in
the
compliment
for
a
few
seconds,
then,
with
my
head
still
swollen,
I
turn
back
to
the
paper
to
continue
practicing
my
punctuation
marks.
----------------
After
mastering
the
art
of
the
question
mark,
I
moved
on
in
my
writing
evolution.
I
completed
third
grade
with
three
skills
that
would
form
the
foundation
of
my
writing
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
First,
I
knew
how
to
actually
draw
symbols
that
people
could
interpret
as
letters
and
therefore
read
my
writing.
This
skill
is
often
overlooked
as
the
most
important
one
in
writing,
but
if
one
does
not
know
how
to
physically
write,
one
is
not
going
to
have
a
successful
writing
career.
Second,
I
discovered
that
I
greatly
enjoyed
reading.
I
tore
through
chapter
books
like
I
was
in
sixth
grade.
My
teachers
were
flabbergasted
and
I
showered
in
their
lauding.
My
constant
reading
never
ceased
and
I
believe
it
to
be
what
accelerated
my
ability
to
write
well
because
it
allowed
me
to
understand
writing
structure,
build
my
vocabulary,
and
think
at
a
more
advanced
level.
The
third
thing
I
took
away
from
third
grade
as
a
writer
was
likely
a
by-product
of
my
reading.
I
learned
how
to
write
paragraphs.
Many
students
could
write
a
sentence:
NThe
sky
is
blue,O
or
NI
like
puppies,O
were
favorites
(though
they
were
often
misspelled).
Some
students
were
even
able
to
write
two
sentences:
NI
like
to
play
soccer.
I
score
a
goal.O
I,
on
the
other
hand,
was
able
to
craft
full
paragraphs.
Third
grade
was
the
diving
board
over
the
pool
that
is
my
writing
career.
Kindergarten,
first
grade,
and
second
grade
I
climbed
the
ladder
up
to
the
board
and
third
grade
I
walked
the
plank
until
I
was
on
the
precipice.
I
gazed
down
at
the
expansive
blue
water.
I
could
not
even
see
the
other
side
of
the
pool.
Nevertheless,
I
bounced
a
few
times
and
dove
headfirst.
I
continued
my
reading
and
writing
improvements
through
the
last
two
years
of
elementary
school.
I
recall
performing
quite
well
on
spelling
tests
in
fifth
grade
because
I
had
seen
all
of
the
words
before
due
to
my
constant
reading.
I
also
remember
a
book
report
I
did
on
The
Hardy
Boys
that
year.
I
had
read
every
book
in
the
series
and
I
chose
to
write
about
one
in
particular,
though
I
do
not
remember
which
in
particular.
What
I
do
remember
is
that
I
spent
two
whole
pages
recounting
the
plot
in
detail
as
well
as
several
paragraphs
on
how
enthralling
the
mystery
was.
I
most
likely
had
the
good
taste
to
withhold
the
ending
so
that
any
classmates
who
were
actually
listening
to
me
deliver
the
report
would
not
have
the
story
ruined.
I
received
an
A
on
the
report
which
boosted
my
pride
and
gave
me
the
confidence
to
continue
swimming
in
the
right
direction
as
my
writing
became
longer
and
more
thoughtful.
Middle
school
began
a
major
expansion
in
my
writing:
the
research
paper.
Sixth
grade
was
dull
in
the
writing
scene
with
likely
only
a
handful
of
meaningful
assignments,
but
seventh
grade
was
an
exciting
year.
My
history
class
for
the
first
time
switched
to
something
other
than
American
History.
I
had
Ancient
Cultures
with
Mr.
Murch.
Mr.
Murch
was
my
favorite
teacher.
He
had
a
sense
of
humor
that
kept
the
students
fully
engaged
in
his
class
because
we
respected
him
and
enjoyed
him
so
much.
It
was
my
first
experience
with
Ancient
Cultures,
a
class
in
which
I
learned
about
Ancient
Egypt,
Mesopatamia,
and
Greece
among
others.
I
have
always
been
much
more
inclined
toward
American
History,
yet
my
two
history
classes
outside
of
that
subject
(the
second
of
which
I
will
discuss
later)
have
been
two
of
my
favorite
history
classes
ever.
The
culminating
project
of
the
class
was
a
seven-page
research
paper
on
the
subject
of
our
choosing
as
it
related
to
Ancient
Cultures.
The
subject
could
be
as
broad
as
gender
roles
in
three
of
the
societies
we
studied
or
as
specific
as
elections
in
Ancient
Greece.
At
this
point
in
my
life,
I
had
an
intense
desire
to
be
a
doctor
(I
have
since
changed
my
mind)
and
so
I
chose
to
do
my
research
paper
on
medicine
in
three
of
the
cultures.
I
spent
many
hours
reading
books
from
the
library
and
taking
notes
and
organizing
my
research.
Once
I
began
to
write
the
paper,
I
learned
how
to
structure
a
research
paper
with
multiple
subjects.
I
learned
how
to
write
a
thesis.
I
learned
how
to
write
an
introduction
and
a
conclusion.
I
also
learned
how
to
integrate
my
research
through
quotes
and
examples
into
my
body
paragraphs.
It
was
a
watershed
moment
in
my
writing
career
as
it
was
the
first
time
I
put
skills
to
the
test
that
I
would
be
using
for
the
next
ten
years
at
least.
I
was
pleased
with
my
paper.
I
turned
it
in
with
a
smile
on
my
face
because
I
knew
I
had
done
a
good
job.
Several
days
later
the
class
went
to
a
local
amusement
park
as
an
end-of-the-year
trip.
The
students
were
allowed
to
roam
around
wherever
we
pleased
while
the
teachers
sat
in
restaurants
and
locations
around
the
park
working
on
grading
or,
more
likely,
enjoying
what
amounted
to
a
day
off.
My
friends
and
I
stopped
at
the
Pizzeria
Uno
for
lunch
and
passed
Mr.
Murch
and
another
teacher.
He
was
sitting
with
a
stack
of
papers
in
front
of
him
and
I
spied
my
paper
with
red
comments
written
on
it,
but
I
could
not
see
the
grade.
Mr.
Murch
called
me
over
to
tell
me
something
in
private.
NJason,
I
have
to
tell
you,
your
paper
was
incredibly
well
done
and
very
mature.
You
handled
some
subjects
like
suppositories
in
a
mature
way
and
I
was
just
really
impressed
with
the
paper.
Great
job.O
Needless
to
say
I
had
to
adjust
my
hat
for
my
inflated
head
for
the
rest
of
the
day.
The
Ancient
Cultures
research
paper
was
my
first
experience
with
a
truly
academic
writing
assignment.
By
then
I
had
written
several
analytical
essays
about
novels,
none
more
than
a
few
pages,
and
I
had
never
written
a
real
research
paper.
It
was
rewarding
not
just
because
Mr.
Murch
complimented
me
so
highly,
but
because
I
saw
that
I
could
write
seven
pages.
At
a
young
age
D
and
even
today
to
be
honest
D
being
asked
to
write
seven
pages
is
a
fairly
daunting
assignment.
It
is
certainly
easier
now,
but
that
is
because
of
projects
like
this
one
in
which
I
saw
my
capabilities
as
a
writer.
Eighth
grade
provided
me
with
two
exciting
writing
opportunities.
We
switched
back
to
American
History
and
my
teacher
Mrs.
Brown
created
a
fun
atmosphere
for
the
class.
One
of
my
favorite
projects
I
have
ever
done
was
in
her
class.
We
assumed
the
role
of
a
delegate
to
the
Constitutional
Convention.
We
had
to
write
a
speech
in
support
of
one
of
our
key
issues
and
then
present
it
to
the
class,
earning
extra
points
for
authenticity.
I
was
John
Rutledge
of
South
Carolina.
As
Rutledge,
I
supported
slavery
and
wrote
a
speech
in
that
vein.
It
was
an
interesting
experience
having
to
write
in
support
of
something
that
I
of
course
did
not
support
in
the
slightest.
It
was
also
fun
to
present
it
to
the
class
with
a
southern
accent
and
hear
them
criticize
me
after
class.
I
told
them
I
was
just
doing
the
assignment
and
that
I
did
not
actually
mean
anything
I
had
written.
The
second
writing
assignment
was
more
involved.
It
was
another
research
paper.
I
chose
to
write
about
the
Constitution
and
how
it
shaped
AmericaOs
history.
It
involved
a
similar
process
as
the
previous
yearOs
paper,
but
I
found
it
more
interesting
because
of
the
subject.
Mrs.
Brown
did
not
pull
me
aside
like
Mr.
Murch
had,
but
I
received
a
good
grade
and
I
had
a
fun
time
writing
the
paper.
I
also
was
able
to
see
how
I
had
grown
in
a
year
as
a
writer.
My
analysis
was
much
more
insightful
and
my
sentences
were
clearer.
My
dad
read
it
over
and
I
remember
him
being
very
impressed
with
how
the
paper
flowed
so
well
together.
It
was
my
last
major
writing
assignment
of
middle
school.
High
school
was
right
around
the
corner
and
there
would
be
a
lot
more
writing
at
a
higher
standard.
I
was
pleased
with
where
I
was
as
a
writer
and
was
anxious
to
start
the
next
chapter
of
my
writing
life.
Much
like
college
a
few
years
later,
in
high
school
there
always
seemed
to
be
a
paper
due.
My
first
experience
with
perpetual
writing
assignments
was
my
ninth
grade
English
class
which
was
a
broad
course
and
covered
several
different
genres
of
literature
so
that
the
student
could
be
exposed
to
them
and
think
about
which
captured
his
interest
the
best.
Mr.
Mayer
(pronounced
like
the
city
official,
not
the
wiener
entrepreneur)
had
an
ongoing
assignment
called
OPALs
which
stood
for
One
Page
At
Least.
In
these
assignments,
which
we
were
given
twice
a
week
on
average,
we
were
to
discuss
the
previous
nightOs
reading.
They
do
not
rank
among
my
finest
writing
productions,
but
they
were
a
solid,
consistent
way
to
practice
my
analytical
writing
with
some
feedback
from
a
great
teacher.
History
in
my
freshman
year
was
not
a
bevy
of
writing
assignments,
but
I
did
have
to
do
a
long
essay
about
modern
Eastern
EuropeOs
role
in
the
European
Union.
It
was
one
of
the
more
challenging
papers
I
have
ever
done
because
I
was
not
the
least
bit
interested
in
the
topic.
I
ended
up
crafting
a
nice
paper
which
my
teacher
said
was
very
insightful.
I
was
proud,
but
I
was
not
interested
in
pursuing
the
subject
any
further
than
I
had
to.
My
sophomore
year
of
high
school
was
characterized
by
one
course:
AP
US
History.
It
was
the
only
AP
class
offered
at
my
school
outside
of
three
math
and
science
courses
which
I
would
not
dare
attempt.
It
was
an
incredibly
challenging
course
with
constant
writing,
test
taking,
and
immense
reading
assignments.
I
loved
every
second
of
it.
I
was
fully
engrossed
in
the
material
and
my
teacher
Ms.
Peck
was
enthusiastic
and
helpful.
It
was
billed
as
a
college-level
course,
but
we
expected
them
to
go
easy
on
us
considering
we
were
just
sophomores
in
high
school,
however,
this
was
not
the
case.
I
did
more
work
for
that
class
than
I
have
for
several
college
courses.
Some
of
our
constant
assignments
were
things
called
DBQs
which
stood
for
Document
Based
Questions.
We
were
given
several
short
documents
from
the
time
period
that
we
were
studying
at
the
time
such
as
a
newspaper
article
or
a
cartoon.
Then
we
were
to
write
an
analytical
essay
using
the
documents
as
sources.
They
were
difficult
to
write,
but
as
we
practiced
they
became
easier
and
by
the
end
of
the
year
they
were
a
breeze.
I
often
had
my
dad
look
them
over
and
he
liked
them
more
and
more
as
the
year
progressed.
At
the
end
of
the
year
I
managed
to
get
a
five
on
the
official
test
which
was
a
nice
validation
of
all
the
hard
work
I
had
done
that
year.
During
the
summer
going
into
my
junior
year
I
participated
in
a
program
called
the
National
Youth
Leadership
Forum
on
Medicine.
I
had
a
strong
desire
to
be
a
doctor
(that
has
since
shifted
to
law)
and
this
program
was
a
great
opportunity
to
get
a
look
at
what
doctors
do
every
day.
The
culminating
project
was
to
create
a
poster
and
program
which
would
raise
awareness
about
an
assigned
disease.
Ours
was
meningitis.
We
developed
a
fantastic
project
called
Monkeys
for
Meningitis
involving
stuffed
animals
and
pamphlets
and
a
well
thought
out
business
plan.
We
also
had
to
have
a
speech
prepared
should
we
win
the
preliminary
round.
I
was
elected
to
deliver
it.
I
wrote
a
great
speech
highlighting
our
strengths
and
why
we
were
the
best
project.
As
it
turned
out,
I
was
the
only
person
who
had
bothered
to
pre-write
their
speech.
We
won
the
whole
competition
thanks
in
large
part
to
my
speech,
so
I
felt
quite
validated
in
my
speech-writing
and
delivering
abilities.
Junior
year
had
my
first
two
major
research
papers
since
middle
school,
so
obviously
they
were
held
to
a
much
higher
standard.
I
took
two
history
courses
that
year:
Medieval
European
History
and
Law
&
American
Society.
The
former
was
a
much
more
challenging
course
with
college-level
material
and
subjects
we
had
never
studied
before.
My
teacher
Mr.
Armistead
made
it
interesting
and
engaging.
Much
like
Mr.
Murch,
I
respected
him
because
he
had
fun
while
teaching
us.
Also
like
Mr.
Murch,
our
final
research
paper
could
be
about
anything
we
wanted.
At
this
point
in
my
life
I
had
begun
to
shift
my
career
interests
away
from
medicine
and
toward
law,
so
I
figured
I
would
cover
each
in
my
research
papers.
For
this
class,
I
chose
law.
I
wrote
about
how
several
societies
handled
law
and
order
in
medieval
times.
It
was
an
extensive
research
project
which
culminated
in
a
15-page
product.
Mr.
Armistead
was
impressed
with
the
breadth
of
my
research
and
how
much
I
had
covered.
I
was
pleased
that
I
had
been
able
to
write
a
paper
that
long
with
consistent
quality.
Law
&
American
Society
offered
a
similar
assignment.
I
chose
to
embrace
medicine
in
this
one.
I
examined
medical
malpractice
laws
and
their
affect
on
doctorsO
ability
to
practice
medicine.
I
asserted
that
because
so
many
patients
sued
their
doctors
unnecessarily,
it
has
become
impossible
for
doctors
to
practice
medicine
without
fear
of
patientsO
retribution.
Therefore,
they
are
focused
on
covering
their
own
interests
before
the
patientOs
which
creates
a
dangerous
situation.
Again
I
turned
in
a
15-page
analysis
which
my
teacher
found
engrossing
and
insightful.
I
had
written
30
pages
of
research
paper
in
the
last
month
and
I
was
extremely
proud
of
myself.
My
parents
and
brother
helped
in
the
editing
process
and
were
all
impressed
with
what
I
had
written.
My
senior
year
writing
experiences
were
quite
different
first
and
second
semester.
First
semester,
I
had
a
course
in
which
we
read
novels
and
wrote
analytical
essays
on
them.
It
was
nothing
new
in
the
way
of
assignments,
but
I
had
not
read
any
of
the
books
before,
so
that
was
exciting.
I
felt
my
writing
was
better
than
it
had
ever
been
and
my
teacher
often
suggested
the
same
in
her
feedback
on
my
essays.
I
ended
that
semester
confident
in
my
analytical
writing
ability.
The
next
semester
I
began
an
entirely
new
style
of
writing
in
a
course
called
Memoirs.
As
the
name
would
suggest,
we
wrote
memoirs
and
read
a
few
published
ones.
I
had
never
written
in
that
style
before,
but
I
quickly
got
the
hang
of
it
and
found
that
it
is
quite
fun
to
write
about
my
own
life.
Even
if
it
is
a
boring
story,
it
can
be
made
exciting
by
the
writing.
That
course
was
actually
quite
helpful
in
writing
this
very
paper
and
I
am
happy
I
took
it.
Before
I
move
on
to
my
brief
college
experiences
with
writing,
I
should
note
that
all
four
years
of
high
school,
I
was
on
the
newspaper.
I
was
an
editor
sophomore
and
junior
year
for
the
Sports
section
and
senior
year
I
was
Editor-In-Chief
and
editor
of
the
Features
section.
It
was
a
lot
of
work,
but
I
am
extremely
proud
of
it.
I
also
wrote
every
issue
of
high
school
which
helped
immensely
in
writing
for
classes.
My
senior
year
I
was
given
an
award
for
Best
Editorial
by
the
New
England
Scholastic
Press
Association
for
an
editorial
I
had
written
about
a
classmate
who
had
been
killed.
In
college,
there
is
even
more
writing
than
in
high
school.
My
American
Studies
class
required
multiple
papers
per
class.
My
FYS
required
a
script
for
a
Saturday
Night
Live
sketch.
My
International
Politics
class
had
two
midterms
and
a
final
and
for
each
one
we
wrote
six
short
answers
and
two
essays.
And
every
other
class
has
required
multiple
essays
on
a
regular
basis.
On
top
of
that,
I
also
have
a
column
in
the
newspaper
called
NGold
vs.
Gold.O
It
has
certainly
been
a
lot
of
writing,
but
I
am
in
no
way
upset
about
it.
I
love
to
write
and
it
has
been
great
to
bring
my
abilities
to
the
next
level
and
improve.
When
I
was
informed
of
my
acceptance
into
the
College
Writing
Program,
I
was
ecstatic.
Freshman
year
I
often
helped
my
friends
with
their
essays
or
edited
their
papers
for
them.
The
fact
that
I
am
trusted
to
help
strangers
with
their
papers
is
flattering.
I
am
sure
it
will
also
help
my
own
writing
as
I
begin
to
think
like
a
more
advanced
writer.
My
writing
saga
has
been
long
and
ever-growing.
I
have
improved
light
years
from
third
grade
when
I
could
hardly
even
manage
the
physical
task
of
writing
and
I
am
excited
to
continue
to
improve.
