My
Literary
Narrative
Writing
Associate
Project
August
10,
2002
Reflecting
on
my
history
and
development
as
a
writer,
I
observe
that
my
ability
to
write
has
been
deeply
affected
by
time
invested
in
reading
works
by
other
writers.
As
children
we
begin
reading
material
that
is
more
advanced
than
what
we
are
capable
of
writing.
When
I
first
learned
to
read,
I
taught
myself
at
the
age
of
four
based
on
what
I
had
learned
about
letters
and
pronunciation
from
my
parents
reading
aloud
to
me.
At
that
young
age,
I
loved
reading,
probably
because
it
was
something
new
that
made
me
feel
special
and
more
like
an
adult.
I
realize
now
that
everything
I
read
at
that
age
and
every
word
spoken
by
my
parents
was
building
the
vocabulary
that
I
would
use
later
when
learning
to
write.
For
my
early
years
of
school,
my
history
of
writing
probably
mirrors
that
of
most
students.
I
began
writing
individual
letters
of
the
alphabet
and
soon
learned
to
put
those
letters
together
to
write
words
and
my
full
name.
I
remember
that
one
of
our
first
exercises
in
first
grade
was
to
write
our
names
and
full
home
address
on
pre-lined
paper
for
our
teacher.
My
mother
had
already
taught
me
this
at
home,
so
I
was
able
to
perform
this
exercise
quite
quickly.
I
remember
my
teacher
being
surprised
at
my
speed
in
completing
the
assignment
while
other
students
were
still
slowly
writing
away.
In
first
grade,
I
learned
to
write
basic
words,
often
words
that
had
been
learned
through
reading
class
and
special
"word
books"
that
we
were
to
study
at
home
with
our
parents.
I
was
quickly
moved
to
the
second-grade
reading
group
as
a
first-grader,
where
I
continued
to
build
my
vocabulary.
I
think
it
was
at
this
point
that
what
I
read
began
to
influence
my
understanding
of
sentence
and
paragraph
construction,
writing
style,
and
grammar
standards,
as
this
was
my
first
serious
encounter
with
short
stories
in
paragraph
form.
Another
important
writing
development
at
this
time
in
my
life
was
the
ability
to
write
numbers
and
use
them
to
express
mathematical
relationships.
In
second
through
fourth
grade,
many
of
my
writing
assignments
were
creative
writing,
often
based
on
a
story
read
in
class.
My
ability
to
express
my
thoughts
on
paper
was
reinforced
through
homework
assignments
with
questions
requiring
answers
in
the
form
of
a
sentence.
Especially
toward
fourth
grade,
history
and
science
reading
assignments
were
often
accompanied
by
questions
testing
my
comprehension
of
the
material.
Mathematics
became
more
advanced,
and
I
learned
to
solve
word
problems
using
numbers
and
basic
written
arithmetic.
In
fifth
and
sixth
grade,
my
school
had
a
class
called
"Creative
Writing"
that
was
held
for
40
minutes
every
week.
In
this
class,
we
were
assigned
various
writing
exercises
that
challenged
us
to
use
our
imagination
and
to
communicate
our
ideas
using
the
writing
conventions
we
had
learned.
I
remember
receiving
compliments
on
my
writing
from
my
teachers
and
feeling
very
proud
of
my
creative
writing
pieces.
My
imagination
had
been
developed
through
my
love
of
reading,
and
I
felt
like
creative
writing
class
gave
me
the
chance
to
be
the
kind
of
writer
who
wrote
the
books
I
enjoyed.
During
this
time,
my
English
class
included
a
rigorous
grammar
component
in
which
we
were
taught
grammar
rules
and
sentence
structure.
I
remember
my
fifth
grade
teacher
showing
us
how
to
diagram
sentences,
an
exercise
which
I
particularly
enjoyed.
For
me,
it
seemed
logical
that
every
sentence
could
be
broken
down
into
many
smaller
sentence
components.
Amazingly,
this
grammar
that
I
learned
in
fifth
grade
was
more
extensive
and
taught
more
skillfully
than
any
grammar
course
I
have
encountered
in
my
academic
history
thus
far.
In
later
years
I
learned
a
few
more
grammar
rules
here
and
there,
but
for
the
most
part
the
foundations
were
set
in
my
mind
at
this
early
age.
Throughout
high
school
and
even
in
college
I
have
found
my
understanding
of
and
schooling
in
grammar
to
be
more
comprehensive
than
that
of
most
of
my
peers.
I
believe
that
in
seventh
grade
I
began
writing
essays
in
response
to
material
I
had
read.
History,
reading,
and
English
classes
included
short
essays
as
a
component
of
homework
assignments.
In
eighth
grade,
my
school
required
students
to
participate
in
a
writing
class.
In
this
course,
we
learned
to
write
in
various
genres
and
for
various
purposes.
Our
teacher
encouraged
us
to
develop
our
styles
in
the
writing
genres
we
enjoyed
most.
I
recall
one
assignment
of
which
I
was
particularly
proud.
We
were
asked
to
describe
in
fine
detail
a
particular
situation
of
our
choosing.
At
the
time,
I
lived
and
breathed
mystery
novels,
so
the
scene
I
chose
was
very
mysterious
with
a
spooky
setting.
I
think
it
was
a
favorite
piece
of
mine
because
I
was
able
to
communicate
a
scene
from
my
imagination
in
a
way
that
completely
recreated
the
scene
for
the
reader,
just
like
the
authors
of
my
favorite
mystery
novels
had
done.
In
ninth
grade
my
Honors
English
class
was
taught
by
a
lady
who
oozed
exuberation
for
reading
and
writing.
She
was
very
passionate
about
her
students'
development
as
readers
and
writers.
I
think
our
writing
assignments
were
mainly
our
emotional
responses
to
what
we
had
read,
supported
or
illustrated
through
references
to
specific
portions
of
the
work.
Often
our
exams
in
this
class
included
paragraphs
or
short
essays
responding
to
literary
pieces.
This
English
teacher
may
have
been
the
first
individual
to
provide
criticism
of
my
writing
and
offer
ways
in
which
I
could
improve.
Before
this
class,
most
of
my
teachers'
responses
were
only
positive
and
complimentary.
I
think
it
was
surprising
to
receive
criticism
of
what
I
had
written
and
that
I
might
have
taken
the
criticism
personally
at
times.
However,
I
did
come
to
realize
that
my
teacher
desired
to
challenge
me
and
assist
me
in
improving
my
writing
style
and
technique.
Around
this
time,
my
writing
experience
expanded
to
include
writing
in
another
language.
I
studied
French
in
junior
high
and
high
school,
and
as
my
French
vocabulary
and
reading
comprehension
became
more
advanced,
I
was
challenged
with
short
writing
assignments,
written
in
French.
Through
this
writing
I
began
to
learn
the
French
rules
of
grammar
and
preference
of
style.
In
many
ways
this
was
similar
to
beginning
to
write
in
English,
as
my
first
attempts
were
based
on
what
I
had
learned
through
reading
and
vocabulary
building
in
that
language.
In
high
school
I
elected
to
take
the
most
challenging
courses
possible.
For
tenth
and
eleventh
grade,
this
included
honors
English
courses.
Most
of
the
writing
assignments
in
these
classes
were
responses
to
books
or
articles.
In
contrast
to
what
I
wrote
in
ninth
grade
English
class
-
mostly
emotional
responses
-
these
assignments
focused
on
characters
or
themes
in
written
work.
Research
papers
were
also
required
components
of
the
courses.
Interestingly,
both
years
I
chose
rather
scientific
topics
for
these
research
papers.
In
eleventh
grade
my
research
paper
explored
the
facts
and
issues
surrounding
biological
and
chemical
warfare.
My
English
teacher
challenged
me
to
write
an
article
based
on
this
research
for
a
local
editorial
contest
that
year;
I
won
second
place
for
this
article,
and
it
was
printed
in
the
Reading
Eagle/Times.
This
was
truly
an
exciting
moment
for
me
in
my
history
as
a
writer.
It
was
also
the
most
public
display
of
my
writing
thus
far.
In
twelfth
grade
I
elected
to
take
Advanced
Placement
English,
the
most
challenging
English
reading
and
writing
course
I
have
taken
thus
far.
My
teacher
required
us
to
journal
our
thoughts
and
reactions
periodically
as
we
read
the
assigned
books,
short
stories,
poems,
etc.
I
think
it
is
easy
to
read
through
a
book
without
stopping
once
to
reflect
on
the
characters,
themes,
situations,
and
implications
contained
in
what
has
been
read.
Keeping
a
journal
helped
me
to
personalize
what
I
had
read,
and
I
think
that
my
enjoyment
of
what
I
had
read
was
increased
through
these
personal
reflections.
Additionally,
the
journals
were
helpful
in
developing
my
comprehension
of
various
literary
works
before
I
was
asked
to
write
any
essay
or
formal
response
to
the
work.
Although
I
have
not
continued
this
practice,
I
think
it
would
be
valuable
to
continue
keeping
a
journal
based
on
books
I
read,
and
I
somewhat
regret
not
investing
time
in
this.
With
college
came
a
significant
shift
in
the
focus
of
my
writing.
With
few
exceptions,
most
of
my
writing
has
been
within
a
scientific
of
technical
genre.
The
main
exception
was
my
first-year
seminar,
"The
American
College
Student."
For
FYS,
I
was
required
to
submit
a
journal
entry
to
my
professor
weekly
and
had
several
longer
writing
assignments
that
required
outside
research
and/or
personal
interviews.
This
may
have
been
the
first
time
that
I
did
not
enjoy
my
writing
assignments.
I
didn't
feel
very
passionately
about
the
topics
about
which
I
was
to
write,
and
I
found
the
assignments
to
be
more
tedious
than
enjoyable.
For
the
most
part,
I
had
been
able
to
find
topics
for
past
writing
assignments
for
which
I
had
personal
feelings
or
a
general
interest.
I
found
the
writing
component
of
my
class
to
be
disappointing
for
this
reason.
However,
I
was
given
opportunities
to
exercise
my
writing
ability
in
very
new
ways
through
scientific
and
technical
assignments.
I
believe
that
I
wrote
my
first
technical
document
ever
as
part
of
my
Introduction
to
Engineering
class,
ES-101.
This
was
the
first
time
that
I
collected
scientific
data
and
summarized
the
results
in
a
written
report.
For
that
assignment,
each
student
was
required
to
meet
with
the
professor
to
discuss
his
report
and
for
the
professor
to
make
recommendations
about
the
student's
technical
writing
technique.
My
professor
had
only
good
things
to
say
about
my
report;
he
was
very
impressed
with
my
ability
to
explain
the
experimental
data
and
with
my
writing
style
and
grammar.
I
think
this
was
an
exciting
moment
for
me
because
this
was
my
first
technical
writing
experience.
While
I
had
been
certain
of
my
ability
to
write
adequately,
I
had
been
unsure
of
how
to
apply
that
ability
to
this
new
type
of
assignment.
Sophomore
year
I
wrote
extensive
laboratory
reports,
mostly
in
my
inorganic
chemistry
course.
For
each
experiment
I
wrote
a
report
that
included
an
abstract,
introduction,
theory,
detailed
explanation
of
experiment
and
procedure,
presentation
and
discussion
of
results,
and
conclusions.
I
think
the
most
challenging
aspect
of
writing
these
reports
was
understanding
the
theory
behind
the
experiment.
If
I
did
not
adequately
understand
the
theory,
then
understanding
the
experiment
and
its
results
was
difficult,
if
not
impossible.
Additionally,
the
reports
were
generally
six
to
eight
pages
in
length,
single-spaced,
so
maintaining
flow
of
ideas
and
focus
of
direction
throughout
the
report
was
challenging.
Struggling
through
writing
these
laboratory
reports
laid
the
foundation
for
my
later
development
as
a
technical
writer,
as
they
required
me
to
create
my
own
personalized
method
of
approaching
such
a
report.
I
also
learned
the
value
of
beginning
the
reports
early
in
the
week
and
approaching
the
professor
with
questions,
tactics
that
greatly
improved
the
quality
of
my
laboratory
reports.
Junior
year
I
encountered
the
most
challenging
writing
assignments
of
my
writing
history
in
my
chemical
engineering
laboratory
courses.
The
laboratory
reports
I
wrote
required
incredible
mental
focus
and
a
very
thorough
understanding
of
experimental
theory,
procedure,
and
data.
Looking
back,
I
think
I
may
have
set
the
standard
for
these
reports
even
higher
than
the
standards
set
by
my
professors;
my
idea
of
what
I
wanted
to
accomplish
in
my
reports
and
a
desire
to
write
excellently
very
much
shaped
how
organized
and
extensive
the
reports
were.
For
each
report
I
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
with
my
professors,
seeking
a
better
understanding
of
the
theory
behind
each
experiment
and
discussing
the
implications
of
the
experimental
data.
Despite
the
difficulty
and
time-consuming
nature
of
these
reports,
I
think
I
enjoyed
finishing
them
even
more
than
I
had
enjoyed
the
accomplishment
of
past
writing
assignments.
I
particular
love
how
my
reports
were
unique,
since
they
were
based
on
data
and
on
a
procedure
about
which
I
was
the
only
person
writing
a
report.
Therefore,
my
reports
were
unlike
the
reports
of
my
classmates.
I
also
enjoyed
the
responsibility
of
determining
what
my
experimental
data
meant
and
what
the
practical
implications
were.
Other
people
could
understand
my
experiment
and
learn
from
its
implications
based
on
what
I
had
written
in
my
report.
Often
my
reports
were
written
for
both
the
professor
and
the
next
lab
group
continuing
the
experiment,
so
it
was
important
that
my
report
was
a
lucid
and
comprehensive
literary
work.
What
made
me
feel
particularly
special
was
that
my
professor
first
semester
informed
me
that
my
reports
were
the
best
first
drafts
he
had
ever
seen,
and
that
I
was
the
first
student
whom
he
would
not
require
to
write
a
second
draft.
That
remark
made
me
feel
that
I
had
written
my
best
literary
works
thus
far,
and
I
knew
that
in
many
ways
I
had
grown
as
a
technical
writer
through
writing
those
reports.
Lastly,
since
becoming
a
college
student,
I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
writing
for
professional
audiences.
For
the
past
three
summers,
I
have
interned
in
various
fields
of
chemical
engineering,
and
each
summer
my
supervisors
have
expected
me
to
summarize
my
research
in
technical
reports
for
the
benefit
of
my
co-workers.
This
summer
has
in
many
ways
been
the
culmination
of
my
professional
and
technical
writing
ability
to
date.
I
have
delighted
in
brooding
over
my
research
thoroughly
and
in
summarizing
the
results
in
the
most
concise
yet
comprehensive
manner.
I
have
enjoyed
the
independence
that
my
supervisors
have
granted
me
in
designing
my
experiments
and
in
understanding
what
they
mean.
I
feel
that
my
excitement
about
the
results
of
my
research
spread
to
my
coworkers
when
they
read
my
reports,
because
the
work
I
have
done
is
important
to
their
research
and
has
been
communicated
to
them
in
an
effective
manner.
It
has
been
rewarding
to
receive
compliments
from
my
coworkers
and
supervisors
on
my
writing
ability
and
on
the
research
I
have
completed
this
summer.
Looking
ahead
to
graduation,
I
am
excited
for
the
many
technical
writing
opportunities
that
will
arise
if
I
am
hired
as
a
full-time
chemical
engineer
and
for
the
ways
in
which
my
writing
ability
will
benefit
the
company
that
employs
me.
I
feel
that
in
many
ways
my
writing
experience
at
Lafayette,
particularly
in
the
chemical
engineering
department,
has
prepared
me
for
technical
writing
in
the
professional
world.
The
creative
and
responsive
writing
skills
I
have
learned
may
serve
to
benefit
me
personally,
as
I
continue
to
read
other
individual's
literary
works
and
may
desire
to
express
my
response,
even
if
it
is
only
for
my
own
eyes.
I
hope
these
skills
will
also
benefit
the
students
at
Lafayette
as
I
serve
as
a
Writing
Associate
an
encounter
many
literary
genres
and
styles
of
writing.
