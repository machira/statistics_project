KOWALSKI
My
first
writing
experience
occurred
in
first
grade.
My
first
grade
teacher,
Mrs.
Bunny,
assigned
my
best
friend,
Lauren,
and
I
to
write
a
book
report
on
the
book
of
our
choice.
I
selected
to
write
about
a
twelve
page
book
about
a
mouse.
Lauren
selected
to
write
about
a
different
book.
Consequently,
we
wrote
our
papers
independently.
I
distinctly
remember
carefully
printing
my
paper
by
hand
using
fat
green
pencil
as
a
writing
utensil
and
trying
my
hardest
to
write
with
perfect
penmanship.
Grammar
was
still
a
foreign
concept
to
me
and
handwriting
was
constantly
being
emphasized.
I
was
more
concerned
with
how
my
essay
looked
than
what
I
actually
wrote.
Letters
were
valued
by
me
for
their
shapes,
not
for
the
words
and
phrases
that
they
were
capable
of
forming.
For
the
next
five
years
of
grade
school,
I
primarily
wrote
similar
book
reports
and
essays.
Although
my
words
became
larger
along
with
my
books,
it
was
not
until
seventh
grade
that
I
truly
began
to
write
with
any
analytical
thought.
The
authors'
intentions
began
to
be
more
important
to
me
than
my
opinions.
I
began
questioning
the
authors'
purpose
and
the
symbolic
meanings
of
their
works.
I
now
interpreted
what
I
read
in
order
to
understand
its
meaning.
Furthermore,
my
English
teacher,
Ms.
Amesbury,
assigned
me
questions
to
answer
for
that
day's
reading
in
a
daily
journal.
I
did
not
enjoy
being
forced
to
write
in
a
journal
every
day.
However,
when
I
look
back
at
my
journal
and
reread
my
entries,
I
can
see
a
clear
development
of
my
writing
and
analytical
skills
throughout
the
school
year.
In
addition
to
our
daily
journal
entries,
every
student
was
assigned
to
do
an
oral
presentation
and
to
write
a
paper
to
go
along
with
it.
I
selected
to
do
my
presentation
on
Elvis
Presley,
and
to
this
day,
I
can
still
recite
my
speech
because
it
was
a
monumental
experience
during
my
academic
writing
career.
I
was
required
to
hand
in
my
outline,
introduction,
summary,
and
conclusion
prior
to
wring
the
actual
body
of
my
paper.
Through
this
experience,
I
learned
organization
skills
that
have
since
proven
to
be
fundamental
it
every
writing
assignment
that
I
have
completed
since
that
time.
Then,
in
ninth
grade,
my
English
teacher,
Mr.
Dombeck,
assigned
to
me
my
first
term
paper.
I
was
not
positive
at
the
time
what
exactly
writing
a
term
paper
entailed.
However,
I
was
told
by
the
upperclass
students
who
had
already
taken
the
course
that
it
was
a
grueling
assignment
which
took
a
very
long
period
of
time
to
complete.
It
was
a
wonderful
and
rewarding
experience
that
I
have
never
forgotten.
The
assignment
did
take
a
long
time
to
complete.
However,
my
teacher's
enthusiastic
response
to
my
paper
made
the
time
and
the
effort
that
I
put
into
it
well
worth
it.
Mr.
Dombeck's
reaction
to
my
paper
made
me
feel
confident
about
my
writing
skills
and
gave
me
the
research
skills
necessary
for
successful
writing
in
the
following
years
of
high
school.
However,
since
I
had
written
my
paper
on
an
historic
event,
I
was
not
yet
aware
of
the
great
importance
of
topic
selection.
I
had
inadvertently
selected
a
topic
that
was
not
considered
either
obscene
or
unacceptable
according
to
my
teacher's
value
system.
I
would,
however,
learn
the
grave
importance
of
a
topic
in
the
following
years.
In
eleventh
grade,
I
wrote
a
paper
about
Daniel
Defoe's
novel
Moll
Flanders.
My
parents
are
relatively
conservative
and
I
asked
them
to
read
my
paper
before
I
handed
it
into
my
teacher
and
presented
it
to
the
class.
My
parents
were
very
supportive
of
my
writing
skills
and
commended
me
for
writing
a
thorough
paper.
Nonetheless,
when
I
presented
my
paper
to
the
class,
my
teacher,
Mrs.
Whalen,
nearly
had
a
heart
attack
in
front
of
the
class.
Unlike
my
parents,
she
did
not
approve
of
my
paper
and
asked
me
to
step
outside
with
her
to
discuss
my
paper
topic
for
a
moment
immediately
following
my
introduction.
Since
I
attended
a
very
conservative
small
school
with
Christian
values,"
Moll
Flanders
was
banned
from
classroom
reading.
It
did
not
matter
how
well
or
poorly
written
my
paper
was
because
the
topic
was
not
acceptable.
Now,
I
always
consider
who
will
be
my
reader
when
I
write
any
papers.
The
incident,
although
frustrating
and
seemingly
unfair,
afforded
me
the
opportunity
to
appreciate
the
power
of
expression
through
writing.
Furthermore,
it
taught
me
that
grades
are
not
always
as
important
as
what
you
learn.
I,
unfairly
in
my
opinion,
received
an
F"
for
my
paper
because
of
the
book
that
it
was
about,
not
because
it
was
not
well
written.
Consequently,
I
do
not
place
importance
on
the
grades
that
I
earn
on
my
papers,
but
rather
what
I
learn
from
the
entire
writing
process.
In
fact,
my
most
prized
pieces
of
writing
have
never
even
been
graded.
A
perfect
example
is
my
senior
project
in
high
school.
During
my
senior
year
in
high
school,
I
selected
to
take
an
English
enrichment
class
in
addition
to
my
normal
daily
scheduled
classes.
It
was
a
one-on-one
course
that
had
its
class
time
during
my
lunch
period
every
day.
My
teacher,
Mr.
Hopkins,
assigned
me
to
view
videos
and
read
several
books
during
this
time
period
and
out
of
the
classroom.
I
primarily
focused
on
reading
and
studying
Joseph
Campbell's
novel
The
Hero's
Journey
and
applying
Campbell's
ideas
to
Shakespearean
plays.
I
wrote
weekly
essays
and
by
the
end
of
the
year
I
was
able
to
compile
a
comprehensive
and
cohesive
paper
relating
the
works
to
each
other.
This
paper
is
my
favorite
personal
piece
of
writing,
not
because
I
received
an
A
for
it,
since
it
was
never
graded,
but
because
of
the
self-satisfaction
that
it
has
given
to
me.
Since
my
senior
project,
I
find
myself
writing
more
and
more
on
my
own.
I
keep
many
of
my
works
to
myself
because
of
their
personal
nature
and
the
feeling
of
accomplishment
that
they
give
me.
I
do
not
share
my
poetry
or
short
stories
with
others
because
I
do
not
seek
the
approval
of
others
to
make
me
feel
good
about
my
writing.
I
am
my
own
worst
critic
and
greatest
fan.
Over
the
past
three
years
at
Lafayette
College,
I
have
developed
in
a
variety
of
ways
as
a
writer.
I
have
become
more
analytical,
philosophical,
and
critical
with
my
thinking.
I
believe
that
my
writing
reflects
this
personal
growth.
My
professors
have
always
been
both
critical
and
supportive
with
regard
to
my
writing
skills.
I
feel
that
my
high
school
writing
experiences
in
conjugation
with
my
parent's
support
of
my
writing
skills
has
given
me
a
strong
foundation
for
academic
collegiate
writing.
Nonetheless,
I
have
not
completed
three
years
of
undergraduate
studies
without
receiving
several
bumps
and
bruises
along
the
way.
The
second
semester
during
my
junior
year
was
my
most
difficult.
I
did
not
find
my
writing
assignments
to
be
extraordinarily
hard.
Nonetheless,
I
struggled
more
with
writing
papers
than
ever
before.
Writing
always
came
easily
to
me
up
until
that
time.
I
could
no
longer
sit
down
at
my
computer
the
night
before
my
paper
was
due
and
write
it.
In
fact,
I
could
not
successfully
write
any
of
my
papers
even
when
I
would
attempt
to
write
them
weeks
before
they
were
due.
It
was
not
because
I
could
not
think
of
topics
or
approaches
for
all
of
my
papers
that
I
could
not
complete
my
papers,
but
because
I
had
lost
complete
confidence
in
my
writing
abilities.
I
would
write
for
long
periods
of
time
only
to
throw
away
what
I
had
written.
This
time
period
is,
ironically,
when
I
feel
that
I
grew
the
greatest
as
a
writer.
Many
of
the
papers
that
I
wrote
last
semester
were
in
my
opinion
the
worst
papers
that
I
have
written
since
I
have
been
at
Lafayette.
In
retrospect,
without
these
failures,
I
believe
that
I
would
not
have
grown
as
a
writer.
For
my
first
five
semesters
at
Lafayette,
I
wrote
consistently
well-written
papers.
However,
I
did
not
show
any
dramatic
improvements
in
my
writing.
I
definitely
became
a
better
writer,
but
the
differences
in
my
writing
were
not
as
significant
as
I
would
have
liked.
Last
semester,
I
challenged
myself
to
improve
my
writing
skills.
I
took
many
risks
that
seemed
to
fail.
But,
with
each
new
risk
and
criticism,
I
grew
as
a
writer.
I
began
to
realize
my
strengths
and
weaknesses
and
learned
various
ways
of
improving
each.
My
professors
were
all
very
supportive
of
my
essays
and,
offered
me
various
approaches
to
writing
literary
criticisms
that
would
improve
my
writing.
It
became
most
obvious
to
me
that
my
strengths
were
in
creative
writing
rather
than
literary
criticisms.
Consequently,
this
past
summer
I
decided
to
try
to
restore
my
confidence
by
writing
creatively
on
my
own.
I
currently
keep
a
daily
journal
which
contains
my
most
profound
thoughts
and
ideas
along
with
any
stories
or
poems
that
I
write.
This
book
provides
me
with
an
outlet
to
record
my
daily
frustrations
and
to
write
freely
to
myself.
My
journal
allows
me
to
question
my
own
works
much
as
my
professors
do
at
Lafayette.
I
do
not
have
the
experience
or
the
knowledge
that
many
of
my
professors
have,
however,
through
their
example,
I
have
learned
to
delve
deeper
into
every
paper
by
questioning
everything
that
I
write.
I
hope
that
the
independent
writing
exercises
that
I
have
done
this
past
summer
will
be
reflected
in
my
writing
in
the
year
to
come.
I
will
continue
to
keep
my
journal.
Perhaps
eight
years
from
now
I
will
reread
this
journal
and
see
myself
develop
as
a
writer
much
as
I
did
with
my
journal
from
seventh
grade.
