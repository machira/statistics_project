Driving
Home
At
last,
it
had
finally
come.
rYay!
Time
to
give
my
brain
a
rest!s
I
thought,
racing
out
of
my
last
final
exam.
I
threw
all
of
my
belongings
into
the
backseat
of
my
best
friendus
car,
buckled
my
seat
belt,
and
sped
off
towards
New
Jersey,
the
sun
setting
behind
me.
rFinally,
five
minutes
to
think
about
something
besides
school!s
But
no
sooner
had
we
hit
Route
78
did
I
realize
that
my
thoughts
were
still
back
at
Lafayette.
And
suddenly
it
struck
me:
I
was
half-way
through
my
rLafayette
Experiencesiaor
as
my
parents
would
have
said,
halfway
through
rthe
best
four
years
of
my
life.s
So
there
I
was,
in
the
middle
of
78
East,
pondering
how
Iud
grown.
When
I
came
to
college,
I
didnut
know
what
I
would
major
in.
I
started
out
as
an
international
affairs
major,
then
became
a
biology
major,
then
a
neuroscience
major,
and
now,
finally,
Ium
a
history
and
government
&
law
major.
I
guess
itus
safe
to
say
Iuve
always
been
confused.
But
Iuve
always
known
one
thing
for
absolute
certain:
whatever
I
do
or
wherever
I
end
up,
I
want
to
graduate
knowing
that
I
can
write.
I
want
to
know
that
I
can
get
my
thoughts
out
on
paper
eloquently
enough
that
my
audience
can
read
my
paper
once
and
understand
its
intent.
Since
I
love
working
with
people
and
sharing
my
opinions,
I
know
doing
so
will
be
essential
in
whatever
I
choose
to
do
with
my
life.
Naturally,
the
question
popped
up
in
my
head.
rHow
am
I
doing?s
The
answerus
not
simple.
But
Iull
start
by
saying
this:
to
anyone
who
thought
that
being
a
Writing
Associate
was
solely
about
helping
others--
youure
sorely
mistaken.
Becoming
a
WA
was
probably
the
best
thing
I
could
have
done
for
my
own
personal
growth
as
a
writer.
Let
me
explain.
As
a
first
semester
WA,
I
was
nervous.
Iud
always
edited
my
friendsu
papers,
but
it
had
never
been
a
formal
deal.
And
the
class
I
was
assigned
to,
the
rMyths
of
Masculinity,s
sounded
especially
frightening.
A
lot
of
the
assignments
centered
on
archetypical
representations,
a
concept
that
was
basically
foreign
in
my
mind
except
for
a
few
distant
memories
from
AP
English.
And
even
though
Iud
been
told
it
wasnut
my
job
to
know
the
course
material,
I
was
still
worried
that
I
wasnut
going
to
be
competent
enough
to
really
help
the
students
in
the
class.
I
got
a
bit
of
a
wake
up
call
when
one
of
the
students
strolled
into
Pardee
319
and
plopped
down
next
to
me
at
the
conference
table.
She
greeted
me
shyly,
as
it
was
our
first
meeting,
and
I
asked
her
if
she
had
brought
a
draft
of
the
assignment
with
her
(because
I
hadnut
received
one
in
my
mailbox).
Instead
of
pulling
papers
out
of
the
bag
she
had
slung
over
her
shoulder,
Sarah
folded
her
hands
on
the
desk
and
looked
sheepish.
rActually
Ium
kind
of
having
a
bit
of
trouble.
I
donut
know
what
to
write,s
she
said,
eying
me
curiously.
Well
this
was
a
new
one.
We
hadnut
covered
this
in
the
training
workshops.
rDo
you
understand
the
assignment?s
I
asked
her,
biting
my
lip
and
hoping
her
answer
might
get
me
somewhere.
rActually,s
she
said,
rI
really
just
donut
know
where
to
begin.
I
have
all
these
ideas
but
I
donut
know
what
to
do
with
them.s
To
my
relief,
I
got
an
idea.
I
grabbed
a
sheet
of
scratch
paper
out
of
my
binder
and
handed
Sarah
a
pen.
rOkay,s
I
said,
putting
the
sheet
between
the
two
of
us.
rWell,
what
is
it
that
you
want
to
say
in
this
paper?s
And
that
was
how
it
began.
A
half
an
hour
later,
Sarah
had
scribbled
down
her
ideas,
talked
about
how
they
were
interrelated,
and
started
to
put
together
her
thesis.
Miraculously,
our
awkward
meeting
had
become
a
productive
discussion.
Only
after
Sarah
had
thanked
me
and
left
Pardee
with
her
scratch
paper
did
I
realize
the
valuable
lesson
that
I
had
learned.
I
had
asked
Sarah
to
tell
me
what
she
wanted
her
paper
to
be.
Why
hadnut
I
ever
done
that
myself?
I--
the
girl
whous
always
hated
planning
her
papers
in
advance
and
finds
outlines
too
rigid
to
work
with--
had
a
sudden
revelation:
Maybe
planning
doesnut
have
to
mean
outlining
ideas
with
roman
numerals
and
bullets.
Maybe
itus
just
a
matter
of
identifying
what
it
is
I
need
my
paper
say
to
someone
reading
it.
So
now,
when
I
have
the
ideas
swirling
around
in
my
head
and
I
canut
seem
to
get
them
out
in
words,
I
tell
someone
else
what
Ium
trying
to
write
about.
Iull
call
my
mom,
bug
my
roommate,
or
talk
to
someone
on
my
floor.
Why?
Because
it
forces
me
to
think
about
what
it
is,
really,
that
I
am
writing
about.
I
know
I
canut
tell
them
all
of
those
swirling
thoughts
from
my
head;
I
am
forced
to
figure
out
what
it
is,
in
a
nutshell,
that
I
am
going
to
say.
Afterwards,
if
I
need
to,
I
make
a
list
of
what
I
need
the
reader
to
rget.s
Sometimes
I
draw
arrows
or
write
key
phrases.
It
doesnut
matter
how
sloppy
it
is
if
it
helps
me
make
those
swirling
thoughts
come
alive.
Another
early
lesson
I
learned
in
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
was
a
lesson
about
style.
When
I
delved
into
my
first
stack
of
papers
1st
semester,
there
was
one
student
whose
paper
drove
me
crazy.
I
read
his
paper
and
wanted
to
rewrite
it.
rWhy
would
you
say
it
like
that?s
I
found
myself
asking,
in
spite
of
my
efforts
to
keep
an
open
mind.
rI
would
never
say
it
like
that.s
And
then
I
realized.
The
key
word
in
that
sentence
was
rI.s
I
would
never
write
it
like
that.
I
would
write
it
differently.
The
more
I
thought
about
it,
the
more
I
realized
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
this
studentus
writing;
his
ideas
were
expressed
differently
than
I
would
have
expressed
them.
I
think
that
happens
to
a
lot
of
us
when
we
look
at
papers.
We
see
a
really
great
idea,
and
we
think
about
how
we
would
write
about
that
idea.
But
we
donut
always
realize
that
the
way
that
we
would
write
about
it
isnut
necessarily
the
right
way,
itus
just
our
way.
So
I
read
the
paper
again.
It
was
an
amazing
lesson,
not
only
just
in
how
I
read
other
peopleus
papers,
but
in
how
I
write
and
read
my
own.
I
realized
that
every
paper
I
write
is
an
expression,
in
some
form,
of
my
personalityiaof
the
way
that
I
think
and
perceive
the
world
around
me.
And
depending
on
what
Ium
writing
about
or
who
I
am
addressing,
itus
okay
to
show
off
the
different
angles
of
that
personality.
Itus
okay
to
write
a
little
differently
than
I
might
otherwise
write.
Itus
okay,
perhaps,
to
think
outside
of
the
box.
My
second
semester
as
a
WA
was
a
continuation
of
my
learning
experience.
WAing
for
the
VAST
course,
rThe
Green
Revolution,s
Iud
stretch
out
on
my
floor
and
delve
into
the
stacks
of
papers
Iud
pulled
out
of
my
mailbox.
One
night,
I
was
reading
letters
the
students
had
written
to
the
president
outlining
their
position
on
the
spotted
owl
crisis
in
the
Pacific
Northwest.
So
I
would
be
more
familiar
with
the
subject
matter,
I
decided
to
skim
through
the
stack
of
papers
before
I
worked
on
each
paper
individually.
In
doing
so,
I
quickly
bumped
into
a
problematic
trend.
Because
the
professor
had
given
the
students
a
rigid
format
for
the
letter,
their
letters
seemed
to
jump
abruptly
from
one
section
to
another.
How
could
I
help
them
transition
better
without
leading
them
to
disregard
the
assignment?
Even
though
I
had
always
known
what
a
transition
was,
my
perception
of
it
was
about
to
change.
Everybody
knows
from
high
school,
or
maybe
even
middle
school,
what
a
transition
is.
Weuve
all
sat
through
countless
class
discussions
and
lectures
on
the
subject.
But
when
it
comes
down
to
it,
a
transition
is
really
just
a
way
of
keeping
the
reader
on
the
writerus
train
of
thought.
It
really
doesnut
matter
whether
you
use
a
classic
transitional
phrase
or
a
paragraph
rhooks
to
do
it
as
long
as
the
reader
can
slide
into
the
next
paragraph
without
feeling
like
theyure
making
a
sharp
turn
in
an
unknown
direction.
So
I
started
marking
spots
on
the
studentsu
papers
where
I
felt
it
wasnut
easy
to
follow
their
train
of
thought.
I
didnut
want
to
tell
them
to
rtransitions
better;
that
seemed
too
much
like
high
school
English
jargon
that
they
didnut
want
to
hear.
Instead,
I
told
them
that
I
couldnut
quite
follow
how
they
got
from
one
paragraph
to
the
next
one
and
spent
time
discussing
with
them
why
(outside
the
rigid
boundaries
of
the
assignment)
they
might
follow
up
their
paragraph
with
the
next
one.
It
was
much
more
fruitful
than
saying
rHey,
you
need
a
transition
here.s
It
didnut
take
me
long
to
realize
that
this
change
in
my
conference
language
had
also
impacted
my
own
writing
and
editing
process.
When
I
wrote
my
papers,
I
tried
harder
to
keep
the
reader
in
mind.
Obviously
when
you
go
from
one
paragraph
to
the
next,
you
have
a
reason
for
it:
itus
your
train
of
thought.
The
trick
is
making
sure
that
the
reader
is
on
your
train
of
thought
and
never
gets
off
of
it.
It
might
be
my
paper,
but
itus
the
readerus
experience,
and
itus
my
job
to
make
sure
that
they
get
what
I
want
them
to
get
out
of
it
without
getting
lost
along
the
way.
Length
constraints
imposed
by
professors
in
both
courses
I
rWA-eds
for
also
got
me
thinking.
Seldom
did
I
have
students
who
wanted
to
go
past
the
paper
length
that
the
professor
had
specified,
but
there
were
always
a
couple
who
just
couldnut
stop
writing.
rI
know
itus
too
long,
but
I
just
had
more
to
say,s
theyud
tell
me.
I
could
easily
tell
a
student
to
shorten
his
paper,
but
as
a
writer
myself,
I
realized
that
that
is
a
task
much
more
easily
stated
than
done.
So
if
and
when
this
issue
came
up,
I
instead
found
myself
trying
to
identify
with
the
student
what
issues
were
key
to
their
discussion
and
which
were
not
as
crucial.
Sometimes,
it
was
simply
that
their
excitement
over
the
subject
led
them
to
use
wordy
phrases
and
sentences
that
were
clearly
amendable.
Having
such
discussions
in
conference
also
assisted
me
with
my
own
wrestles
with
length-constraints.
Iuve
learned
to
force
myself
to
think
about
the
essentialsiathe
key
things
that
I
need
my
reader
to
get
out
of
my
work,
and
to
limit
myself
to
those
ideas.
I
examine
what
things
Iuve
spent
too
much
time
on,
or
what
things
I
donut
need.
Sometimes,
I
too,
find
those
spots
where
I
got
so
excited
about
what
I
was
writing
about
that
I
went
off
the
deep-end
with
it.
All
in
all,
my
writing
has
become
much
more
reader-focused.
So,
as
my
best
friendus
car
sped
towards
New
Jersey
and
I
pondered
all
of
the
things
that
I
had
learned
and
all
of
the
ways
that
Iud
changed
over
the
course
of
the
year,
I
couldnut
help
but
wonder
about
my
writing.
I
tried
to
decide
how
much
Iuve
grown
and
how
I
have
improved.
But
instead
of
coming
to
a
concrete
conclusion,
I
came
to
a
couple
of
realizations.
Life,
as
far
as
I
see
it,
is,
and
always
will
be,
about
learning.
Itus
about
taking
a
foundation
and
building
upon
it
day
after
day,
year
after
year,
a
stronger
and
better
developed
individual.
Writing
is
very
much
the
same.
This
past
year,
I
continued
to
build
upon
that
foundation.
It
was
different
than
years
past,
however,
in
that
I
grew
not
only
as
the
result
of
my
own
writing
experiences,
but
as
the
result
of
taking
part
in
the
writing
experiences
of
my
peers.
Being
a
WA
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
grow
as
a
writer
in
a
way
I
had
not
been
able
to
do
in
the
pastiaand
in
ways
I
never
would
have
expected.
But
while
I
realized
that
I
have,
indeed,
added
more
weight
and
strength
to
the
writer
that
I
was
one
year
ago,
I
also
realize
now
more
than
ever
that
my
journey
has
only
just
begun.
I
may
have
grown
tremendously
over
the
past
year,
but
I
am
still
eager
to
continueiastill
ready
to
add
more
experience
and
knowledge
to
the
writer
that
I
am
becoming.
And
as
my
car
rolled
into
my
driveway,
I
blinked
my
eyes
and
smiled.
I
was
home.
