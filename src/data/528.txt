Returning
Writing
Associate
Literacy
Narrative
Thinking
about
this
literacy
narrative
has
enabled
me
to
think
about
my
past
yearOs
experiences
as
a
Writer
and
Writing
Associate.
This
is
something
that
I
would
ordinarily
not
have
done,
but
is
important
in
order
to
help
me
develop
as
a
writer
and
WA.
Since
I
enjoy
writing,
and
believe
that
it
is
an
extremely
important
skill
to
develop,
I
have
put
a
lot
of
effort
into
writing
all
the
papers
that
I
have
written
at
Lafayette.
Also,
given
the
uncertainty
that
I
had
in
my
mind
when
I
first
came
to
college
regarding
my
writing
skills
and
whether
they
would
be
up
to
the
standards
expected,
it
was
a
great
source
of
pride
for
me
to
discover
that
I
actually
did
well
in
my
papers.
Therefore,
becoming
a
Writing
Associate
itself
was
a
big
achievement
for
me.
I
realized
that
it
would
be
a
great
opportunity
for
me
to
learn
and
develop
my
own
writing
skills,
while
also
being
able
to
help
other
students
with
their
writing.
For
my
first
meeting
with
the
class
to
which
I
had
been
assigned
as
a
WA,
I
was
a
bit
nervous
since
I
had
never
done
such
a
thing
before.
However,
the
professor
was
very
supportive
of
me
in
class,
and
this
made
my
job
easier.
For
my
first
round
of
conferences
I
was
naturally
a
little
apprehensive.
However,
since
I
had
attended
a
number
of
conferences
while
I
was
taking
the
First
Year
Seminar,
and
had
also
observed
a
number
of
conferences,
I
had
some
idea
of
what
was
expected
of
me
in
a
conference.
In
addition
I
had
also
read
the
Writing
Associate
Handbook,
which
also
helped
me.
My
comfort
level
with
the
conferences
increased
significantly
after
I
had
my
first
few
conferences.
During
the
Fall
semester
I
was
assigned
to
a
First
Year
Seminar
course.
Since
everyone
in
the
class
was
a
first
year
student,
one
of
the
main
authorities
that
I
could
draw
on
to
help
them
was
my
experience
in
writing,
having
already
gone
through
the
first
year
seminar,
as
well
as
other
writing
courses.
I
also
feel
that
since
it
was
my
first
time
as
a
Writing
Associate,
and
I
was
also
only
a
sophomore,
it
helped
to
not
be
assigned
to
a
class
with
mainly
upperclassmen
since
it
might
have
made
things
harder
for
me.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
has
been
a
great
experience
for
me.
It
has
enabled
me
to
learn
a
lot
and
develop
in
a
variety
of
different
ways.
Conducting
conferences
and
addressing
the
class
has
helped
increase
my
self
confidence.
I
also
learnt
time
management
skills.
In
addition,
discussing
a
number
of
writing
related
issues
in
staff
meetings
also
made
me
think
about
a
number
of
issues
that
I
would
otherwise
not
have
thought
about.
It
also
helped
me
to
develop
my
own
writing
skills.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
for
a
course
also
gave
me
some
insight
into
the
subject
matter
being
taught
in
the
course,
and
this
was
something
that
I
found
very
interesting.
It
enabled
me
to
learn
more
about
a
subject
that
I
didnOt
know
much
about,
and
was
therefore
a
great
experience.
The
faculty
interaction
that
a
writing
associate
job
involves
was
also
a
great
learning
experience.
During
the
spring
semester,
I
was
assigned
as
the
WA
for
a
higher
level
economics
course,
which
had
mainly
junior
and
senior
year
students.
Initially
this
was
a
bit
of
a
challenge
for
me
because
of
the
fact
that
I
was
only
a
sophomore.
However,
for
the
most
part
I
discovered
that
as
this
was
not
really
a
problem.
Another
unique
thing
about
this
course
was
that
it
involved
a
different
kind
of
writing
compared
to
the
papers
that
I
had
seen
for
my
FYS
class.
This
is
because
the
papers
for
this
course
were
directed
towards
a
business
audience.
However,
the
kind
of
writing
involved
was
something
that
I
was
very
comfortable
with.
In
addition,
since
the
papers
were
all
business
plans
for
entrepreneurial
ventures
that
the
students
had
come
up
with,
they
were
extremely
interesting.
This
was
therefore
a
great
class
to
be
Writing
Associate
for.
One
of
the
challenges
that
I
faced
as
a
Writing
Associate
was
students
who
did
not
seem
to
be
interested
in
the
WA
conference
and
viewed
it
as
a
waste
of
time.
On
the
other
hand
there
were
also
students
who
were
really
keen
to
improve
their
papers,
and
were
therefore
extremely
receptive
during
conferences.
It
felt
really
great
to
work
with
such
students.
One
staff
meeting
that
I
particularly
recall,
was
one
in
which
we
discussed
a
reading
on
grammar.
This
reading
was
something
that
I
found
extremely
interesting
because
it
talked
about
various
aspects
of
grammar
and
things
such
as
formal
grammar
versus
usage
grammar.
The
reason
why
I
found
this
reading
very
interesting
was
because
I
myself
often
donOt
know
the
formal
rules
of
grammar,
and
have
always
focused
more
on
usage
grammar.
I
therefore
thought
that
the
issue
was
a
really
relevant
one.
I
also
feel
that
the
drop
in
service
is
very
useful
for
a
number
of
students.
The
drop
in
hours
that
I
served
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
help
students
with
their
writing
in
various
courses,
and
was
a
great
experience
for
me.
Students
who
use
the
drop
in
service
are
really
interested
in
improving
their
papers,
and
working
with
them
was
therefore
a
very
satisfying
experience.
In
addition
to
the
WA
experiences,
I
also
had
some
great
experiences
in
writing
papers
for
my
courses.
During
the
spring
semester,
I
took
the
VAST:
Gambling:
Here
and
Everywhere.
The
first
paper
that
I
wrote
for
this
course
was
a
bit
different
from
regular
papers
since
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
report,
and
therefore
required
only
facts
and
none
of
our
personal
opinions.
Therefore
while
writing
it
one
had
to
be
careful
to
report
only
facts.
The
other
two
papers
that
I
wrote
for
this
course
were
also
really
interesting,
and
also
required
a
lot
of
research.
Although
my
level
of
confidence
while
writing
these
papers
was
higher
than
it
had
been
for
papers
that
I
had
written
in
my
first
year,
because
of
the
fact
that
in
the
previous
semester
I
had
not
taken
any
courses
which
involved
writing
papers,
I
was
initially
a
little
apprehensive
about
them.
However,
once
I
actually
started
writing
a
paper
my
confidence
level
increased.
In
addition
to
the
papers
that
I
wrote
for
my
VAST,
I
also
wrote
an
extra
credit
paper
for
one
of
my
Economics
courses.
This
paper
was
a
research
based
paper,
and
one
that
I
found
extremely
interesting
to
write.
For
all
my
papers,
feedback
from
my
Writing
Associate
was
also
very
useful
because
it
gave
me
an
additional
perspective
on
it,
and
helped
me
improve
it
substantially.
One
of
the
courses
which
was
a
big
challenge
for
me
from
a
writing
perspective,
was
an
economics
course
for
which
I
wrote
various
short
writing
assignments.
The
main
challenge
for
me
in
this
course
was,
that
being
a
Finance
related
course,
the
professor
wanted
a
lot
of
specific
details.
Using
general
adjectives
was
not
acceptable
or
adequate.
This
is
something
that
I
was
not
used
to,
because
in
all
the
other
papers
that
I
have
written
I
have
always
been
using
general
adjectives
to
describe
things.
It
was
therefore
difficult
to
stop
using
them
and
become
more
specific.
For
the
writing
assignments
in
this
course,
I
needed
to
keep
these
things
in
mind,
and
be
more
careful
with
my
writing.
I
realized
that
since
different
subjects
have
different
requirements,
one
needs
to
keep
in
mind
what
is
required
from
us
in
different
courses
and
write
accordingly.
I
also
found
the
reading
assigned
for
this
yearOs
WA
workshop:
Inventing
the
University
very
interesting.
I
could
also
relate
to
it,
since
we
all
face
the
issue
of
having
to
write
for
a
particular
kind
of
audience.
Some
of
the
issues
raised
in
the
reading
are
things
that
I
have
myself
faced
D
situations
in
which
I
have
felt
that
I
was
expected
to
write
from
some
kind
of
position
of
authority
on
a
subject,
yet
where
I
felt
that
I
was
not
actually
an
authority
on
the
subject.
I
can
also
understand
how
it
can
be
hard
for
inexperienced
student
writers
to
move
from
Nwriter-basedO
to
Nreader-basedO
writing
styles.
I
therefore
felt
that
this
reading
talked
about
a
very
relevant
and
interesting
subject.
I
think
that
my
expectations
for
my
own
writing
are
much
higher
today
than
they
were
a
year
ago.
This
is
because
of
the
fact
that
a
year
ago
I
was
not
at
all
confident
about
my
writing
skills,
and
now
as
a
Writing
Associate
I
want
to
hold
up
my
own
writing
to
certain
standards.
I
believe
that
the
strong
points
of
my
writing
are
that
I
aim
to
write
clear
and
organized
papers,
and
even
in
the
papers
that
I
read
as
a
WA
I
do
look
to
help
students
improve
these
aspects
in
their
papers.
Being
a
Writing
Associate
has
helped
me
improve
my
own
writing
skills
and
papers,
because
I
discovered
that
even
while
writing
my
own
papers
I
started
noticing
issues
that
I
was
pointing
out
to
students
in
their
papers.
This
enabled
me
to
become
more
conscious
about
shortcomings
in
my
own
papers
and
improve
on
them.
In
conclusion,
I
believe
that
my
writing
skills
have
further
developed
over
the
past
year,
as
a
result
of
the
writing
that
I
have
done
for
my
courses,
as
well
as
from
what
I
have
learnt
from
my
experiences
as
a
Writing
Associate.
Being
a
writing
associate
has
therefore
been
a
great
learning
experience
for
me,
and
has
helped
me
in
a
number
of
ways
including
helping
increase
my
confidence,
improve
my
time
management
skills,
etc.
Some
of
the
topics
discussed
in
the
staff
meetings
have
also
been
a
learning
experience
for
me.
I
was
also
able
to
learn
a
lot
about
the
courses
that
I
was
a
WA
for,
which
was
very
interesting
for
me.
I
also
faced
various
challenges
as
a
first
time
writing
associate,
but
these
were
also
learning
experiences.
In
the
coming
year
I
hope
to
be
able
to
draw
on
my
experiences
as
a
Writing
Associate
in
the
past
year,
as
well
as
my
experiences
in
all
the
writing
that
I
have
done
for
various
courses,
in
order
to
develop
as
a
Writing
Associate
and
a
writer.
I
also
hope
to
be
able
to
continue
to
improve
my
writing
skills
further
from
all
the
papers
that
I
write
for
my
courses,
as
well
as
from
my
further
experiences
as
a
Writing
Associate.
