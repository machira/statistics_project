A
Signature
Piece
From
every
act,
word,
motion,
and
thought,
people
define
themselves
through
life.
Whether
the
person
is
tall
or
short,
skinny
or
portly,
sociable
or
shy,
these
are
all
qualities
that
a
person
lives
with
and
qualities
that
can
change
from
year
to
year.
Life's
journey
continually
molds
and
shapes
our
physical
appearances,
social
groups,
and
opinions
as
we
indirectly
approach
our
personal
character.
Writing
is
no
different;
although
seldom
looked
at
as
a
means
of
progression,
writing,
closely
linked
to
the
thinking
process,
changes
just
as
readily
as
every
other
aspect
of
one's
life.
In
attempting
to
define
myself
as
a
writer,
I
will
undoubtedly
come
up
short.
I
can
attribute
the
impossibility
of
defining
my
personal
writing
to
the
vast
influences
that
have
altered
it,
and
me,
throughout
the
years;
and
so
I
only
hope
to
shed
light
on
a
history
of
myself
through
my
writing,
as
a
snapshot
reduces
action
to
a
single
frame.
I
often
wonder
why
certain
pictures
of
childhood
stay
with
you
forever.
As
serious
as
falling
off
a
swing
and
breaking
your
arm,
to
your
friend
Johnny
sharing
a
piece
of
his
candy
with
you;
everyone
could
lose
himself
in
childhood
memories.
My
writing
urge
originated
in
one
of
these
special
memories.
Getting
ready
for
bed
every
night,
I
anxiously
awaited
a
bedtime
story.
I
found
myself
amazed
at
how
someone
could
create
such
a
masterpiece.
I
liked
how
the
stories
kept
me
interested
and
how
I
always
wondered
about
the
ending.
Many
of
the
books
that
my
parents
and
grandparents
read
to
me
had
morals
or
lessons;
we
always
talked
about
the
lessons
and
how
the
works
portrayed
them.
Although
I
still
could
not
fully
understand
what
went
into
writing,
these
stories
intrigued
me,
and
I
longed
to
compose
my
own.
In
second
grade,
I
participated
in
a
school
sponsored
'Young
Authors'
convention.
This
school-wide
competition
gave
students
the
opportunity
to
write
stories
to
present
and
display
to
the
entire
school.
Exclusively
student
written
and
illustrated,
one
can
imagine
the
types
of
stories
that
individuals
produced.
Teachers
aided
the
students
in
typing,
printing,
and
fabricating
the
books,
so
that
they
to
looked
as
'professional'
as
possible.
Devising
my
Easter
story,
an
idea
that
I
formulated
from
some
television
show,
I
felt
excited
and
proud
that
I
could
produce
a
story
like
those
that
I
had
been
reading
for
so
long.
I
still
felt
somewhat
held
back,
however,
my
writing
and
illustrations
did
not
readily
compare
to
those
in
popular
storybooks
and
even
worse
to
some
of
the
works
of
other
students.
Even
though
I
saw
these
gaps,
I
still
had
high
hopes
about
writing
in
general.
One
of
the
main
downfalls
of
my
writing
process
and
more
so
my
'creating'
process
that
I
found
early
on,
but
I
still
see
today,
deals
with
perception.
In
my
mind
I
see
a
beautiful
piece
of
writing,
an
elaborate
story,
a
chilling
mystery,
and
a
stunning
twist,
but
when
it
actually
came
down
to
transposing
these
thoughts
from
my
mind,
usually
a
lot
of
this
eluded
the
paper.
I
have
always
asked
myself
and
looked
into
my
writing
to
wonder
if
this
art
of
transposition
truly
defines
the
magnificent
writers
from
the
rest
of
the
world,
or
do
we
all
face
this
hardship
in
our
own
learning
processes.
Do
our
thinking
brains,
advance
faster
than
our
doing
brains?
Or
does
everyone
develop
differently?
I
had
no
clue,
nor
do
I
now,
but
still
I
strive,
often
pulling
up
short,
for
the
perfect
imagine
in
my
head.
I
always
felt
that
even
if
I
could
not
reach
the
perfect
imagine
that
I
had,
I
should
in
someway
attempt
to
distinguish
my
writing
and
thinking
from
those
of
others
who
might
obtain
that
ability
of
amazing
writing.
Throughout
elementary
school
my
parents
always
helped
me
with
writing.
Although
it
did
not
really
seem
beneficial
at
the
time,
looking
back
I
feel
that
their
methodology
helped
me
to
progress
to
a
writing
status
I
would
like
to
achieve.
Many
painful
nights,
I
remember
sitting
down
with
a
blank
sheet
of
paper,
writing
and
constantly
asking
for
help
of
how
to
writing
things
down.
I
knew
exactly
what
I
wanted
to
say,
but
I
could
not
write
it
down
coherently
on
the
paper.
I
wanted
them
to
help
me,
to
write
the
paper
I
had
in
my
head,
to
write
the
words
I
knew
I
thought,
in
an
order
that
would
makes
sense,
though
they
would
only
watch
me
struggle.
They
gave
me
suggestions
of
ways
that
I
could
write
the
sentence
or
thought,
but
never
let
me
use
them
in
the
piece.
I
had
to
compose
my
own
original
prose,
because
otherwise
it
would
not
be
my
writing
or
my
story,
it
would
have
been
theirs.
Despite
my
frustration,
my
parents
and
curriculum
forced
me
to
write
requiring
me
to
produce
higher
quality
work
than
I
had
been
accustomed
to.
During
this
time
in
my
life,
my
writing
level
developed
and
increased
drastically.
Not
only
did
I
read
more
books,
as
examples
of
writing,
but
also
my
parents
made
me
more
aware
of
the
important
aspects
to
include
and
clarify
in
my
writing
before
I
submitted
my
work
for
a
grade.
During
this
time,
around
my
5
grade
in
school,
the
teachers
themselves
aided
significantly
in
my
learning
as
well.
A
grade
just
was
not
a
grade.
After
Mrs.
Kenney
returned
each
piece
of
writing,
we
always
had
a
conference,
going
over
what
aspects
of
my
writing
I
should
spend
more
time
on,
and
more
importantly
what
things
I
had
done
well.
This
positive
reinforcement
helped
me
to
understand
that
I
could
produce
quality
writing
and
helped
me
to
achieve
some
of
the
confidence
a
writer
needs.
I
found
success
in
composing
works
that
I
presented
creatively
and
with
unexpected
twists.
Throughout
much
of
middle
school,
I
used
book
reports
as
a
creative
outlet.
My
teacher,
Ms.
Johnson
accepted
my
techniques
rather
receptively.
From
various
newspaper-
like
articles,
to
comic
book
selections,
I
had
found
a
way
to
disguise
the
subject
matter
in
a
means
that
stood
out
from
others.
Utilizing
these
different
presentation
methods
made
writing
fun
for
me,
because
it
could
be
personal,
and
not
a
form
style.
Difficulties
arose,
however,
when
other
teachers
forced
me
to
write
in
their
specific
styles.
Throughout
the
next
few
years,
many
classes
required
journal
entries
with
specified
lengths
and
designated
question
to
answer.
The
length
requirements
greatly
hindered
my
writing.
Even
though
I
had
always
considered
my
prose
a
bit
wordy,
with
these
required
lengths
I
now
stretched
my
writing
even
more,
removing
precise
clean
prose
and
adding
extra
words
to
fill
the
extra
space.
As
the
journals
forced
me
to
answer
specific
questions,
I
felt
confined,
omitting
my
own
questions
and
thoughts.
It
appeared
that
the
styles
that
I
had
learned,
achieved,
and
excelled
at
throughout
the
beginning
of
my
writing
career,
now
had
to
be
forfeited
for
a
required
style.
Instead
of
following
an
order
that
seemed
logical,
I
adhered
to
an
assigned
outline,
weakening
my
prose
and
adding
vagueness
to
my
work.
The
use
of
the
dreaded
'5-paragraph'
essay,
greatly
affected
me
writing.
Although
a
great
technique
for
organizing
thought
and
formulating
a
persuasive
essay,
I
think
using
the
5-paragraph
essay
hurt
me,
more
than
aiding
me,
as
a
writer.
This
technique
totally
stripped
me
from
my
individuality
as
a
writer,
and
a
thinker
because
every
student
constructed
his
essay
in
the
exact
same
matter.
Even
though
I
could
utilize
this
essay
construction
well
I
found
more
of
a
challenge
and
desire
to
work
with
the
introductions
and
conclusions,
the
'hook'
and
the
clincher,
rather
than
the
form
of
the
essay
in
itself.
As
a
result
of
focusing
on
these
portions
of
the
essay
I
could
distinguish
myself
as
a
writer
and
thinker
rather
than
looking
to
a
form
for
guidance.
Further
trying
to
distinguish
myself
as
a
writer
I
jumped
to
poetry,
for
much
of
my
creative
writing
pieces.
I
found
that
I
could
compose
poetry
in
so
many
different
styles
and
manner
that
I
could
show
my
own
characteristics
and
qualities
as
a
writer.
Poetry
came
easy
for
me,
primarily
because
I
could
transcribe
what
I
viewed
in
my
head
more
easily
than
with
prose.
With
fewer
words
and
a
stream
of
consciousness
style,
I
found
poetry
as
an
outlet
for
the
writer
and
thinker
within
me.
Taking
a
different
look
into
everything,
from
nature
to
our
advancing
society,
I
feel
comfortable
working
with
poetry
still
turn
to
it
every
now
and
then.
More
and
more
however,
assigned
writing
progressed
from
creative
writing
to
essays,
shifting
this
outlet
to
the
back
burner.
Throughout
high
school
I
believe
that
my
writing
went
through
a
number
a
drastic
changes:
most
of
these
changes
for
the
better.
My
high
school,
comprised
exclusively
on
a
writing-based
curriculum,
utilized
excellent
teachers
in
this
area.
The
first
major
change
I
encountered
throughout
high
school
concerned
the
use
of
5-paragraph
essays.
Although
comfortable
with
this
style,
Mr.
Duclos,
our
freshmen
English
teacher,
ardently
weaned
us
from
it.
For
the
next
few
months
we
had
vigorous
classroom
exercises
attempting
to
undue
what
we
all
had
first
learned
in
middle
school
concerning
the
importance
of
5
identical
paragraphs
with
four
to
five
sentences
each.
Eddie
Due,
as
we
all
referred
to
him,
showed
us
example
after
example
of
how
essays
did
not
and
should
not
follow
a
conventional
form
all
the
time.
He
explained
that
we
should
write
in
our
own
styles;
if
we
could
allow
our
essays
to
flow
from
though
to
thought,
and
not
use
the
5-paragraph
form,
in
the
end
our
writing
would
improve
greatly.
This
type
of
advice
rang
like
music
to
my
ears,
however,
reverting
to
personal
prose
proved
a
harder
task
that
I
had
thought.
I
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
simple
and
remedial
styles
of
middle
school
writing,
and
although
it
aided
in
organization,
timidly
I
shied
away
from
writing
with
a
form.
Due
to
my
apprehension,
I
often
tried
to
directly
emulate
the
examples
that
Eddie
Due
presented,
even
though
this
defeated
the
purpose
of
writing
on
my
won.
Although
I
did
not
follow
the
5-paragraph
essay,
mimicking
any
format
still
proved
different
from
my
own,
a
style
that
unknowingly
I
sought.
This
experience
allowed
me
to
evaluate
my
processes
and
myself
as
a
writer,
looking
for
how
I
could
write
and
could
find
success
for
me.
My
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Davidson,
whole
I
had
my
last
two
years
of
high
school
greatly
catalyzed
my
success
as
a
writer.
Not
saying
that
I
have
achieved
the
status
of
an
excellent
by
any
means,
but
she
helped
me
to
find
and
utilize
the
potential
that
I
had
within
me.
For
one
of
the
first
times
she
emphasized
that
writing
had
many
styles,
and
many
types
that
all
had
their
place
in
literature.
Starting
with
ancient
British
Literature
and
pushing
through
the
AP
English
curriculum,
the
exposure
to
a
vast
variety
of
poetry,
prose,
essays,
persuasive
pieces,
reports,
satires,
comedies,
dramas,
plays...
all
opened
my
eyes,
giving
exposure
to
what
I
could
do.
These
examples
of
writing
provided
a
means
through
which
I
could
find
who
I
was
as
a
writer.
At
the
end
of
each
of
my
last
two
years
during
high
school
I
completed
a
final
thesis
paper
for
my
English
classes.
Ranging
from
30
to
60
pages
these
pieces
intensified
the
culmination
of
my
high
school
writing.
Totally
on
our
own
for
subject
matter
and
style
each
student
chose
what
interested
him
and
ran
with
that.
Although
I
never
found
an
interest
in
flat
out
essay
writing,
I
found
methods
to
bring
forth
my
ideas,
thoughts,
and
writing,
in
the
creative,
and
slightly
unique
ways
that
I
had
always
found
myself
able
to
write
in
easily.
Of
course
the
analysis
of
the
literature
dominated
the
works,
however,
at
this
point
I
could
intertwine
this
throughout
my
writing,
allowing
me
to
focus
on
the
main
point
and
not
to
feel
bogged
down
with
lengthy
explanations.
Focusing
on
F.
Scott
Fitzgerald's
short
stories
for
my
AP
English
thesis
paper
I
found,
that
I
not
only
write
to
explain
my
thoughts
and
prove
a
point,
but
that
my
writing
acted
like
a
portal
into
his
works,
helping
me
to
grasp
the
author,
Fitzgerald,
and
understand
the
points
that
allowed
him
so
succeed
as
a
composer.
Understanding
these
keys
to
success,
I
could
then
look
to
myself,
and
with
the
freedom
Mrs.
Davidson
gave
me.
I
found
who
I
was
as
a
writer
excel
throughout
the
year:
not
for
the
class
or
for
the
teacher,
but
for
myself
as
a
writer
and
thinker
as
well.
Entering
college
I
felt
that
I
could
handle
anything,
due
to
the
intensity
of
my
pervious
courses.
Entering
my
FYS
class
I
felt
a
bit
disappointed.
Students
were
still
using
5-paragraph
essays,
and
working
to
satisfy
a
requirement,
and
not
excel.
Professors
assigned
minimum
page
numbers,
which
to
me
seemed
ludicrous.
I
had
been
taught
that
the
paper
should
come
to
an
end
when
everything
that
should
be
said
has
been
said,
and
should
not
have
dictated
beginning
or
end.
Although
a
bit
taken
aback,
I
did
enjoy
the
freedom
of
creative
writing
throughout
the
class.
I
felt
that
creative
writing
had
been
something
that
I
had
missed
out
on
throughout
high
school
and
something
that
I
needed
to
return
to
further
round
myself
out
as
a
writer.
All
in
all
I
feel
that
the
FYS
class
altered
my
progression
as
side
step.
Such
a
class
did
not
advance
my
writing
or
hinder
it,
rather
allowed
it
to
remain
steady.
Throughout
life
every
little
thing
has
an
effect
on
everything
else,
some
cause
drastic
changes
while
others
barely
make
an
impression.
With
writing
especially,
attempting
to
write
about
its
history
does
little
to
actually
portray
it
growth.
Looking,
into
how
I
have
written
this
piece,
instead
of
actually
what
I
have
written
might
in
fact
prove
a
more
accurate
history
my
writing.
For
with
every
work
a
writer
produces,
his
writing
changes,
some
for
better
some
for
worse.
Just
looking
back
on
my
writing,
I
can
see
how
it
has
changed
to
better
fit
me,
who
I
am,
and
who
I
have
become.
As
with
this
history
or
any
other
composition
I
have
written,
I
need
not
strive
to
define
my
style;
for
each
work
is
nothing
more
than
a
'Signature
Piece'.
