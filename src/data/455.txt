A
Few
Lessons
I
Have
Learned
When
I
look
around
at
the
world,
sometimes
all
I
observe
are
opposites.
ThereOs
night
and
day,
good
and
evil,
on
and
off.
My
problems
come
when
I
try
to
categorize
myself
using
that
same
paradoxical
viewpoint.
In
my
high
school
psychology
class,
we
spent
a
day
taking
quizzes
to
determine
whether
we
were
left
brained
or
right
brained,
then
took
a
bunch
of
100
question
multiple
choice
Meyers-Briggs
personality
test.
I
was
the
oddball
who
was
ENFJ
half
the
time,
then
INFP
on
a
different
test.
My
mind,
so
easily
satiated
at
times
by
math
and
science,
required
a
supplement
that
could
only
be
explored
through
language.
When
I
am
at
my
most
reasonable,
I
pull
out
my
homework
and
balance
chemical
equations
or
derive
calculus
formulas.
At
other
moments,
when
either
on
the
verge
of
tears
or
struck
with
the
impulse
to
punch
a
wall,
I
turn
to
the
page
instead.
The
limits
that
guard
Newtonian
Dynamics
and
Calculus
do
not
exist
in
writing.
In
fact,
it
was
not
until
my
first
course
in
the
English
department
just
this
past
year
that
I
was
introduced
to
the
limits
of
writing
when
it
comes
to
exploring
new
genres.
As
I
have
always
seen
it,
it
is
on
the
page
that
we
only
limit
ourselves.
And
while,
at
times,
this
has
caught
me
in
an
endless
struggle
with
how
to
truly
express
myself
through
words,
there
is
a
freedom
that
surrounds
the
limitless.
A
page
can
contain
more
than
a
lifetime.
My
writing
career
began
with
the
futile
scribbles
of
pencil
on
paper.
Wobbly
marks
of
dark
zinc
crisscrossed
through
those
taunting,
guiding
parallel
lines;
they
were
the
landing
strip
for
language.
Repeated
AO[s
through
ZOs
were
pasted
to
the
refrigerator,
and
I
was
taught
to
be
proud
of
the
marks
I
made.
Writing,
or
the
first
few
years,
was
always
a
great
achievement,
but
never
something
to
be
enjoyed.
It
was
a
chore.
Between
the
endless
reports
that
seemed
to
grow
in
length
as
the
years
passed
and
freewrites,
which
never
amounted
to
anything,
my
first
attempts
at
writing
were
memories
I
really
donOt
have.
The
regurgitation
of
information
that
occurred
during
elementary
and
middle
school
was
the
flick
of
a
switch
that
commanded
my
mind
to
only
see
writing
as
negative.
The
positive
side
of
writing
I
experienced
in
elementary
school
was
always
outside
of
the
classroom,
in
the
library.
Writing,
in
earnest,
began
for
me
around
the
time
when
I
read
my
first
great
book,
NJacob
Have
I
Loved.O
From
what
I
remember
now,
it
was
a
story
of
two
sisters,
one
near
perfect
and
the
other,
jealous
and
bitter.
I
finished
it
during
third
grade,
then
proclaimed
for
the
next
two
years
that
it
was
my
favorite
book.
It
was
the
first
time
I
had
connected
with
a
character
of
a
story.
In
this
case,
I
couldnOt
help
but
see
both
halves
of
my
greater
self
divided
into
the
personalities
and
actions
of
these
two
girls.
At
that
moment,
there
suddenly
existed
a
medium
for
connecting
myself
with
others.
If
only
I
could
write
like
that,
my
thoughts
rang.
They
still
do.
When
I
switched
elementary
schools
following
fourth
grade,
I
somehow
missed
the
overlap
between
districts
when
parts
of
speech
are
taught.
I
didnOt
know
what
a
noun
was
until
7th
grade,
and
my
first
grammar
lesson
wasnOt
until
10th.
Still,
I
remember
the
first
time
I
was
given
an
assignment
to
write
an
imaginative
piece
in
sixth
grade.
Oh
that
feeling
of
freedom
D
I
allowed
to
write
about
whatever
I
wanted!
I
donOt
remember
what
I
wrote,
just
how
proud
I
was
when
I
finally
delivered
those
pages
into
my
teacherOs
hands.
A
week
later,
disappointment
overtook
my
pride
when
the
paper
was
returned,
dripping
with
red
ink.
The
teacherOs
corrections,
so
smeared
across
the
page,
were
like
the
blood
that
coated
pavement
after
a
careless
fall.
I
felt
foolish,
like
my
ideas
had
somehow
tripped
across
my
paper.
The
struggle
during
those
first
9
years
of
schooling
was
two-told.
The
first
was
to
fit
my
writing
into
the
narrow
view
of
assignment
that
most
teachers
graded
from.
The
second
is
the
same
issue
that
all
writers
cannot
escape:
living
up
to
oneOs
own
expectations.
The
way
that
I
pictured
stories
in
my
head,
the
way
I
dreamt
about
them,
they
were
never
easy
to
translate
into
those
endless
combinations
of
26
simple
symbols.
Once,
when
talking
with
my
great
Aunt,
a
childhood
escapee
from
Cuba
and
a
proud
Spanish
speaker,
she
imparted
upon
me
the
value
and
difficulty
of
translation.
NIn
Spanish,
we
have
phrases
for
which
the
English
language
has
no
words
to
describe.
We
talk
about
a
feeling,
something
that
you
can
never
comprehend
because,
in
your
language,
it
does
not
exist.O
I
knew
what
she
was
talking
about;
my
translation
problem
was
just
a
bit
different.
So,
like
any
good
student,
I
continued
to
read
and
write.
I
wished
upon
dandelions
that
I
could
create
a
world
of
my
own.
And
the
more
I
read,
the
more
I
lost
hope
that
I
could
ever
write
well
enough.
It
was
in
sixth
grade
that
I
closed
myself
off
to
criticism
from
those
who
mattered
most:
my
parents.
They
only
people
who
ever
read
my
essays
and
stories
were
teachers
or,
if
so
required
for
a
grade,
other
students.
Even
then,
the
draft
reviewed
by
my
peers
was
never
even
close
to
the
final
draft
I
would
submit.
I
never
submitted
writing
about
anything
that
carried
any
meaning
in
my
own
life.
The
thoughts
that
swam
around
in
my
head
each
night
before
I
went
to
sleep
began
to
fill
journals
and
hidden
files
on
the
computer,
but
they
were
mine
and
mine
alone.
With
age
comes
maturity,
and
with
maturity,
acceptance
of
internal
flaws.
High
school
marked
a
turning
point
in
how
I
began
to
view
the
writing
process.
Consumed
by
grades,
I
made
sure
that
I
always
got
AOs
on
my
papers.
For
the
first
time
I
began
to
see
that
writing
was
something
that
came
easily
to
me,
despite
how
hard
I
was
on
myself
with
every
revision.
Freshman
and
sophomore
years
were
a
breeze
of
shorter
essays,
covering
the
basic
types:
expository,
persuasive,
and
imaginative.
To
fulfill
the
Oregon
Mastery
Diploma,
scores
between
one
and
six
were
given
in
four
categories
by
the
teacher.
Four
was
required
for
passing,
but
I
made
sure
I
had
fives
and
sixes
in
every
bos.
It
was
something
I
was
proud
of,
information
I
could
share
with
my
parents.
The
second
they
asked
to
read
the
piece,
however,
I
would
make
up
an
excuse.
According
to
my
lies,
my
locker
was
filled
with
essays.
After
sophomore
year
I
just
flat
out
said
NNo.O
The
first
day
of
IB
Junior
English
I
walked
into
a
small
classroom
barely
filled
D
a
rarity
still
for
Oregon
classrooms.
Thus
far,
I
had
struggled
for
acceptance
and
approval
in
my
writing.
My
repertoire
was
limited
to
the
five
paragraph
essay,
with
specific
guidelines
handed
out
to
hold
studentsO
hands
through
using
quotations,
writing
introductions
and
conclusions,
and
implementing
transitions.
That
year
I
discovered
creative
nonfiction,
commentary,
and
the
power
of
my
own
words.
Writing
became
a
form
of
creation.
I
shed
my
worries
about
the
grades
my
papers
received
and
let
my
writing
just
be
about
me.
That
year,
there
were
no
worksheets
to
guide
possible
focuses
for
essays.
My
thoughts
and
ideas
were
all
of
my
own,
and
I
strove
for
a
different
kind
of
acceptance
that
couldnOt
be
measured
just
by
numbers.
I
wanted,
this
time,
to
be
recognized
for
my
originality.
Of
course,
I
struggled;
my
difficulty
rested
heavily
in
poetry
commentary.
IOve
found
IOm
at
my
most
frustrated
when
IOm
writing,
and
commentary
left
me
with
hands
gripping
my
hair
and
a
red
face.
To
hold
a
heavy
idea
so
close
that
it
crushes
your
chest,
only
to
flit
lightly
away
just
when
you
think
you
have
discovered
the
right
descriptors
to
put
it
onto
paper.
ItOs
like
trying
to
catch
a
butterfly
without
a
net.
You
can
chase
after
it
all
you
want,
but
the
second
you
get
close
and
reach
to
hold
it
in
your
palm,
wings
beat
and
itOs
gone.
It
took
until
the
last
week
of
senior
year
form
e
to
finally
stand
before
my
peers
and
read
my
writing.
For
our
final
English
project,
the
assignment
was
completely
open-ended.
Write
about
whatever,
I
was
told,
as
long
as
it
is
personally
meaningful.
It
was
the
first
time
I
had
ever
shared
a
piece
of
writing
with
anyone.
Writing
had
always
been
sometime
personal,
and
naturally
I
wanted
to
keep
it
hidden
from
others.
This,
consequently,
coincided
with
a
period
in
my
emotional
growth
where
I
was
gradually
learning
the
value
of
trusting
others.
What
I
wrote
outside
of
school
were
letters,
stories,
thoughts
D
all
sorts
of
things
I
found
extremely
meaningful.
But
I
was
sure
I
would
die
before
ever
reading
any
one
of
those
things
I
had
written
to
a
class
of
high
schoolers.
Writing
was
something
I
had
finally
begun
to
do
for
myself,
and
it
was
a
piece
of
my
heart
that
I
wasnOt
ready
to
reveal.
I
ended
up
writing
two
stories,
one
that
I
knew
I
could
easily
share
with
the
class
and
one
that
I
had
written
just
for
myself.
The
first
was
my
college
admissions
essay,
a
traditional
sappy
story
about
college
hunting
with
my
mom
and
how
much
I
had
learned
from
her.
It
was
a
safe
story
to
share.
The
other
was
about
a
family
friend
that
was
dying.
I
had
cried
during
at
least
half
of
the
writing
process,
and
I
cried
when
I
read
it
aloud
to
the
class.
During
times
when
I
felt
stressed
or
emotional,
writing
was
the
tool
that
enabled
me
to
see
my
predicament
from
a
different
angle.
Traveling
3,000
miles
away
from
home
to
college,
the
greatest
transition
I
had
yet
experienced,
was
naturally
a
period
of
excitement,
confusion,
and
emotions
bubbling
over.
I
decided
to
take
a
chance
and
enroll
in
a
writing
course
despite
testing
out
of
college
writing.
The
course
description
mentioned
sharing
and
critiquing
of
other
studentsO
work,
and
I
was
ready
to
face
my
fear
again.
The
nervousness
the
night
before
I
had
to
post
my
first
story
was
nauseating.
I
had
my
three
pages
practically
memories
from
rereading
them
so
many
times.
In
three
days,
the
rest
of
the
class
would
have
written
500
word
commentaries
of
my
piece,
pointing
out
the
good
and
the
bad.
It
would
be
discussed
for
ten
minutes,
while
I
remained
silent
and
listening.
Jump
to
three
days
later,
as
everyone
shuffles
their
papers
around,
pulls
out
their
critiques,
and
begins
to
discuss.
It
is
the
most
empowering
feeling
in
the
entire
world
to
hear
those
around
you
engaged
so
fully
in
a
paper
you
have
poured
yourself
into.
Even
more
empowering
was
the
day
when
someone
told
me
I
was
a
good
writer.
While
all
I
sometimes
see
when
I
look
at
the
world
are
opposites,
there
is
more
to
an
expanse
of
24
hours
than
just
day
and
night.
Even
the
blender
has
12
settings.
I
know
whatever
direction
I
chose
to
pursue,
writing
will
continue
to
be
a
part
of
my
life.
It
is
a
struggle,
but
itOs
a
release,
a
lesson
in
spirituality,
a
form
of
creativity,
and
a
way
to
discover
myself.
I
have
been
told
so
often
that
writing
is
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
spectrum
as
math
and
science
that
I
have
given
up
trying
to
argue.
My
mind
sometimes
bends
into
that
mentality
as
well.
The
difficulty
of
expressing
thoughts,
emotions,
dreams
and
events
with
a
combination
of
26
symbols
is
sometimes,
to
my
mind
nothing
more
than
another
math
problem.
The
number
of
letter
permutations
is
staggering,
but
compared
to
the
subtleties
of
feelings,
of
the
abstract
concepts
of
time
and
place,
there
is
more
to
be
felt
and
seen
and
heard,
more
to
be
experienced,
than
we
can
ever
hope
to
transcribe
onto
paper.
And
while
it
may
not
be
as
concrete
as
the
constants
that
govern
gravity,
or
the
viscosity
of
plastic,
everybody
needs
an
escape
from
reality
once
in
a
while.
