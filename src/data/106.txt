Project
for
Workshop
I
suppose
that
my
experience
with
writing
began
in
pre-school
when
I
learned
my
letters.
But,
given
the
nature
of
the
assignment
coupled
with
the
fact
that
I
don't
remember
much
before
grade
school,
I
think
that
I
will
begin
this
essay
with
my
experiences
with
writing
in
first
and
second
grade.
It
was
during
these
years
that
I
began
to
learn
how
to
form
coherent
sentences
while
continuing,
of
course,
to
brush
up
on
my
letters,
both
upper
and
lower
case.
My
teacher,
Mrs.
Cohen,
would
tell
us
to
take
out
a
pencil
and
then
she
would
hand
out
paper.
When
it
was
that
green
paper
with
the
huge
spaces,
you
know,
the
ones
with
the
two
lines
and
a
dotted
line
in
the
middle
(to
guide
us
with
our
letters),
we
knew
it
was
going
to
be
a
hard
day.
After
I
read
the
topic
for
this
essay,
I
went
through
some
of
the
papers
my
mom
saved
from
when
I
was
young.
One
paper
in
particular
comes
to
mind
when
I
think
of
this
scenario.
It
was
a
green
piece,
just
like
the
one
I
previously
mentioned.
It
was
from
first
grade.
(I
know
this
because,
for
one,
the
"a"
in
my
name
was
backwards,
but
also
because
when
my
teacher
would
send
things
home,
she
always
dated
them
with
the
month
and
the
year
on
the
back.)
Anyway,
this
particular
sentence
was
about
my
dog
Phoebe.
The
sentence
was
as
follows:
"My
dog
is
gray
and
she
is
very
friendly."
What
seems
so
simple
and
maybe
even
a
little
ridiculous
now,
was
so
hard
for
me
then.
What
were
such
feelings
of
dread
when
the
teacher
handed
out
the
paper,
turned
to
feelings
of
pride
and
joy
when
I
took
it
home
to
my
mother....
From
what
I
can
remember,
second
grade
was
basically
a
continuation
of
the
same
with
maybe
slightly
more
complex
sentences
(relatively
speaking).
But
we
also
learned
what
my
teacher
called
"pair
words"(or
homonyms)
which
are
words
that
were
pronounced
the
same
way,
but
are
spelled
differently
and
have
different
meanings.
Other
than
that,
nothing
significant
stands
out
about
my
second
grade
writing.
In
third
grade,
we
had
to
write
a
haiku.
I
don't
remember
exactly
what
I
wrote,
but
I
do
remember
that
it
was
something
about
a
white
bunny.
I
don't
know
why
that
assignment
stands
out
in
my
mind
so
vividly,
but
I
do
know
that
I
didn't
know
what
a
haikui
really
was.
All
I
knew
was
that
it
was
a
"Japanese
poem"
in
my
teacher's
words.
But
what
does
that
mean?
After
all,
what's
a
poem
when
your
in
third
grade
besides
words
that
rhyme?
(It
wasn't
until
I
was
in
high
school
that
I
began
to
appreciate
poetry
and
the
beauty
in
what
it
really
means,
although
I
have
never
loved
haikus....)
In
fifth,
sixth,
and
seventh
grades,
I
realized
that
writing
was
more
than
an
chore.
During
these
years,
I
discovered
that
writing
could
be
thought
of
as
an
art
form
or
an
expression
of
thoughts
and/or
feelings.
I
also
learned
that
writing
could
be
"easy"
and
"fun."
My
love
for
writing
prose
and
poetry
and
even
doing
those
papers
that
were
assigned
in
school
grew
and
grew.
During
these
years,
I
took
part
in
an
Honors
English
class
(in
addition
to
the
standard
language
arts
classes
that
all
students
had
to
take.)
Mrs.
Seabrook,
the
woman
who
taught
this
class,
was
one
of
the
best
teachers
I
have
ever
had.
We
had
the
class
two
days
a
week
and
I
couldn't
wait.
She
had
a
way
of
making
writing
fun.
She
also
had
a
way
of
bringing
out
talents
in
all
of
us
that
we
never
knew
existed.
I,
for
one,
never
knew
I
could
write
poems
(that
meant
something
to
someone
other
than
me)
until
Mrs.
Seabrook
had
her
turn
with
me.
In
fact,
I
was
so
successful
at
this
endeavor
that
I
had
a
few
of
my
poems
published
in
various
books.
I
have
kept
all
of
the
work
that
I
wrote
for
Mrs.
Seabrook
because,
although
it
is
"immature"
(for
lack
of
a
better
word),
it
is
good.
It's
damn
good!
And
what's
more,
the
words
meant
so
much
to
me....
Probably
beginning
in
eighth
grade,
I
realized
that
writing
had
a
function
beyond
that
of
fulfilling
assignments.
Writing
could
be
very
therapeutic.
I
began
keep
journals,
mostly
of
poems.
I
still
keep
these
journals,
and
as
expected,
my
collection
of
such
journals
is
pretty
extensive
now.
But
these
are
thoughts
and
poems
that
I
keep
to
myself.
I
haven't
shared
them
with
anyone.
But
I
do
go
back
from
time
to
time
and
read
them
again.
Since
I
got
sick
(my
senior
year
in
high
school)
with
Chronic
Fatigue
Syndrome,
I
have
found
that
getting
out
my
feelings
and
frustrations
on
paper
is
just
as
helpful
as
any
of
the
experimental
drugs
that
I
have
tried.
Ninth
grade
was
my
first
experience
with
the
dreaded
(well,
at
least
in
my
head
anyway)
term
paper.
Wow...talk
about
my
least
favorite
type
of
writing!
The
initial
experience
was
not
a
good
one.
It
was
a
history
term
paper.
Now,
history
is
not
my
favorite
subject
anyway.
So,
when
I
had
to
do
a
twenty
page
paper
on
a
historical
event,
I
wasn't
too
happy.
I
think
I
shed
a
lot
of
tears
over
that
paper
because
I
couldn't
figure
out
how
to
interpret
the
material
into
my
own
words.
It
is
easy
to
interpret
a
piece
of
literature
in
my
own
words
but
what
is
there
to
interpret
about
history?
All
I
could
do
was
re-write
the
facts.
Thus,
when
my
Dad
read
my
paper,
he
realized
that
I
had
had
my
first
experience
with
plagiarism.....Obviously,
my
Dad
sat
down
with
me
and
showed
me
how
to
do
it
properly.
It
took
a
while,
but
the
finished
product
wasn't
half
bad.
Of
course,
I
continued
to
do
term
papers
throughout
my
high
school
career
and
I
think
it
was
my
AP
History
teacher,
Mr.
Bittle,
who
really
taught
me
how
to
write
a
truly
good
term
paper.
As
far
as
this
type
of
writing
goes,
it
was
this
teacher
who
prepared
me
for
college.
He
had
a
lot
of
faith
in
my
ability
as
a
student
and
he
wouldn't
except
anything
less
than
perfect
from
me.
I
remember
crying
to
Mr.
Bittle
once
and
asking
him
why
he
was
so
hard
on
me
and
not
on
anyone
else.
He
replied,
"You're
good
and
this
is
not
you're
best."
The
other
teacher
who
had
a
profound
effect
on
me
in
high
school
was
Mr.
Paoli,
my
junior
year
English
teacher.
Naturally,
English
was
and
still
is
my
favorite
subject
and
I
genuinely
enjoy
the
English
classes
that
I
take.
During
one
instance,
we
had
to
write
a
short
paper
in
which
we
were
required
to
do
a
character
analysis
of
any
two
characters
in
Shakespeare's
"The
Tempest."
Since
I
love
to
read
and
interpret
prose
and
poems,
I
thought
the
assignment
would
be
fairly
easy.
It
didn't
take
me
very
long
and
when
I
had
finished
the
paper,
I
re-read
it
and
determined
that
it
was
definitely
worth
an
"A."
Unfortunately
Mr.
Paoli
didn't
agree
with
my
assessment.
He
gave
me
a
"B."
Now,
you
must
understand,
I
know
a
"B"
isn't
bad,
but
I
hadn't
ever
received
one
on
any
of
my
papers
and
I
was
a
little
upset
about
it.
However,
I
have
always
respected
this
teacher's
opinion,
so
I
went
to
talk
to
him
after
class.
He
said
it
was
good,
and
probably
was
the
best
one
in
my
class,
but
that
it
wasn't
up
to
my
potential.
Although
I
was
a
little
disappointed
and
didn't
really
agree
with
him,
I
took
his
advice
seriously
and
worked
even
harder
on
the
next
few
papers
he
assigned.
Mr.
Paoli
was
even
kind
enough
to
read
all
of
the
"works-in-progress"
and
when
he
finally
gave
me
an
"A"
and
a
pat
on
the
back,
it
meant
more
to
me
than
any
other
grade
I
had
gotten
up
until
that
time.
Because
I
am
an
English
major
at
Lafayette,
I
feel
that
Mr.
Paoli
taught
me
how
to
write
the
kind
of
papers
that
are
necessary
for
a
successful
college
career.
One
other
teacher
who
left
an
impression
(if
you
can
call
it
that)
was
Mrs.
McMullen.
(I
had
her
my
freshman
year
and
my
senior
year
in
high
school.)
Not
that
she
drastically
affected
my
writing
or
anything,
but
she
had
this
exercise
that
she
made
us
do.
My
classmates
and
I
thought
it
was
very
annoying
at
the
time,
but
I
have
found
especially
helpful
now
that
I
am
in
college.
At
the
beginning
of
every
class,
Mrs.
McMullen
would
put
a
grammar
lesson
on
the
board.
The
grammar
rules
that
she
gave
us
were
those
that
were
commonly
missed.
For
example,
there
was
a
rule
on
how
to
use
a
comma
in
a
particular
context
or
a
rule
explaining
the
different
uses
of
words
such
as
"affect"
versus
"effect"
or
"lay"
versus
"lie."
Every
few
weeks,
she
would
test
us
on
the
points
that
she
had
given
up
until
that
particular
test.
One
may
think
that
this
would
be
pretty
easy,
but
no
one
ever
got
a
perfect
score
on
these
tests.
During
high
school,
I
never
did
see
the
point
of
these
lessons
but,
as
I
said,
I
do
now.
So,
all
in
all,
I
think
my
high
school
teachers
did
a
pretty
good
job
of
preparing
me
for
college.
I
felt
that
I
was
ready
and
my
teachers
had
confidence
that
I
was
too.
But,
as
most
of
us
learn
when
we
go
to
college,
although
my
writing
was
good,
it
wasn't
quite
good
enough....
The
First
Year
Seminar
and
First
Year
Writing
courses
that
every
Lafayette
freshman
is
required
to
take
were
pretty
easy.
The
problem
started
when
I
started
taking
some
more
advanced
English
classes.
Don't
get
me
wrong,
I
have
loved
all
the
English
classes
that
I
have
taken
thus
far,
but
in
the
beginning,
a
few
of
them
proved
to
be
pretty
difficult.

Hi
Vylhqt
1
I
love
to
read
and
write
and
I'm
at
the
point
now
that
I
know
my
writing
is
pretty
good,
but
I
can
always
use
some
pointers
for
improvement.
And
I
have
had
some
great
teachers
(whose
names
I
will
not
mention
but
whose
teaching
talents
I
will
praise.)
Second
semester
freshmen
year
I
took
an
English
class
with
a
teacher
who
taught
me
to
write
a
really
good
interpretive
paper.
He
did
so
not
by
criticizing
our
finished
work,
but
by
having
conferences
with
us
while
we
were
working
on
our
papers.
First
semester
junior
year
I
took
a
poetry
class
and
that
was
another
one
of
my
favorites.
The
teacher
of
this
class
was
really
hard!
At
first
he
just
made
me
angry.
But
he
improved
my
writing
a
great
deal.
He
also
helped
me
learn
how
to
better
interpret
different
types
of
poems.
This
teacher
was
open
about
the
fact
that
he
thought
that
I
was
a
good
writer
and
he
was
adamant
about
forcing
me
to
do
what
he
knew
I
could
do.
Although
I
didn't
have
much
confidence
in
the
grade
I
was
going
to
receive
in
the
class,
I
ended
up
getting
an
A-
for
the
semester.
Like
the
"A"
from
Mr.
Paoli,
this
grade
made
me
very
proud.
Second
semester
sophomore
year,
I
had
a
teacher
who
is
by
far
my
favorite
teacher
thus
far.
In
fact,
I
signed
up
for
another
one
of
her
classes
because
I
liked
her
so
much.
She
was
so
encouraging.
First
of
all,
I
was
a
little
bit
nervous
about
being
one
of
two
sophomores
in
a
class
dominated
by
juniors
and
seniors.
Second,
the
paper
topics
were
very
hard.
However,
this
teacher
helped
me
get
started
on
papers
and
was
always
available
if
I
needed
help
or
just
a
bit
of
encouragement.
In
the
end,
I
did
very
well
in
the
class
and
was
happy
with
the
work
that
I
did.
I
love
poetry,
prose,
and
interpretive
writing,
but
I
am
planning
on
going
into
journalism
after
college.
I
have
thought
about
my
potential
career
a
lot.
I
want
to
be
a
journalist
more
than
anything
but,
at
the
same
time,
I
have
sometimes
thought
that
I
might
not
be
the
greatest
journalist.
I
take
a
lot
of
pride
in
my
writing
(perhaps
in
the
same
way
an
artist
takes
pride
in
his/her
painting)
and
I
don't
like
people
criticizing
my
work.
Anyone
who
knows
anything
about
journalism
knows
that
nine
times
out
of
ten
the
copy
editor
will
deface
an
article
that
he/she
receives.
But,
regardless,
I
do
want
to
go
into
the
field
of
journalism
and
I
will
except
changes
and
criticisms
and
I
will
learn
to
take
them
in
stride.
Writing
has
always
been
and
will
always
be
a
very
important
part
of
my
life.
Whether
it
is
criticized
or
changed,
it
is
still
my
own
and
I
will
take
pride
in
that
fact.
Further,
I
hope
to
continue
to
learn
from
the
criticism
because
we
can
always
improve
on
a
talent.
Also,
I
plan
to
continue
to
keep
personal
journals
and
what
I
write
on
these
pages
will
never
be
changed....
