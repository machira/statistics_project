W.A.
Assignment
I
smiled
with
triumph
and
glanced
up
at
my
parents.
I
had
created
what
I
believed
to
be
my
own
complex
alphabet
on
a
plastic
tablecloth.
My
chocolate
covered
fingers
pushed
back
a
piece
of
my
hair
that
had
become
one
with
my
sticky
cheek.
The
little
dish
and
spoon
that
had
once
been
the
container
for
my
serving
of
chocolate
pudding
had
suddenly
become
a
part
of
the
artwork.
My
own
edible
alphabet
was
what
I
had
created.
I
was
able
to
attempt
a
letter
"A"
and
if
I
messed
up,
it
could
easily
be
squashed
back
into
the
mass
from
which
it
had
been
resurrected.
Chocolate
pudding
was
my
key
to
elementary
writing.
I
could
design
patterns
and
create
letters
with
my
own
fingertips
and
quickly
eat
my
own
words.
Unfortunately,
as
I
discovered
in
grade
school,
pencil
erasing
didn't
taste
as
good.
After
learning
how
to
write
letters
and
words,
I
moved
on
to
the
world
of
spelling.
We
weren't
assigned
to
create
elaborate
stories,
as
I
loved
to
do.
Instead,
we
were
given
spelling
books.
So
I
split
my
time
between
making
up
stories
on
my
own,
and
filling
in
the
dotted
lines
with
difficult
words.
My
second
grade
experience
was
a
mix
of
shaky,
misspelled
words
and
princesses,
gold,
and
"advenchers."
I
constantly
struggled
with
the
fact
that
the
elaborate
story
in
my
head
moved
much
quicker
than
my
hand
could
possible
move.
I
found
it
very
frustrating.
Spelling
on
the
other
hand
was
even
more
frustrating.
Why
did
I
have
to
know
how
to
spell
dictionary?
Princesses
certainly
never
used
them
and
I
did
not
care
to
put
such
a
word
in
my
own
stories.
But,
regardless,
I
worked
hard
and
always
did
fairly
well
in
the
monthly
spelling
bee.
These
competitions
were
used
to
prepare
us
for
the
giant
test
with
100
words
in
the
last
week
of
school!
I
assure
you,
a
second
grader
wouldn't
think
there
were
this
many
words
in
a
D-I-C-T-I-O-N-A-R-Y.
Each
word
was
worth
one
point.
Whoever
got
all
the
words
correct
received
a
certificate
signed
by
the
teacher
and
THE
PRINCIPAL!
This
was
like
gold
to
me.
I
was
sweating
as
all
of
the
other
students
began
to
finish
and
hand
in
their
booklets.
The
last
word
the
teacher
said
was
"whole,
as
in
a
whole
pie."
I
sat
there
and
tried
a
few
letters.
H-O-L-L.
H-O-O-L.
H-O-L.
Finally,
feeling
the
dread
of
missing
out
on
the
certificate,
I
scribbled
H-O-L-E,
knowing
fully
well
that
it
was
incorrect.
Needless
to
say,
I
got
a
certificate.
Well,
I
marched
right
up
the
Mrs.
Wilson
and
showed
her
that
I
spelled
"whole"
wrong.
She
marked
it
with
a
check
on
my
paper
but
it
should
have
been
an
X.
And,
I
swallowed
and
told
her
that
I
didn't
really
deserve
the
certificate.
She
praised
me
for
my
honesty
and
told
me
that
I
could
keep
the
certificate
anyway
because
I
got
99
words
right.
Suddenly,
the
golden
dream
certificate
just
looked
like
a
piece
of
paper.
In
junior
high
school,
I
discovered
the
land
of
poetry.
Rhyming
was
something
I
could
create
quickly
and
easily.
As
a
fifth
grader,
I
was
sure
I
could
identify
a
poem
because
it
MUST
have
rhyme
words.
It
was
simple!
To
prove
this
mastery,
I
created
my
own
poems.
When
my
best
friend
moved
to
Australia,
I
wrote
my
masterpiece.
It
went
something
like
this:
"Moving
is
so
very
bad
When
you're
gone
I
will
be
sad.
Why
don't
your
parents
know
That
you
should
stay
here
and
not
go.
You'll
live
in
a
new
house
And
you
old
one
will
be
as
quiet
as
a
mouse."
That
was
the
embodiment
of
my
pain
toward
my
lost
friend.
These
magical
words
captured
each
emotion
in
one
tragic
ode.
The
rhyming
was
perfect!
I
put
it
in
an
envelope
and
was
prepared
to
mail
it
to
my
friend
but
I
decided
it
was
so
good
that
I
need
to
preserve
a
copy
of
the
doctrine
for
myself.
I
never
sent
it.
Mr.
Goad
was
a
loud
mouthed,
large,
and
angry
man
whose
eyelids
drooped
much
below
the
normal
level.
This
left
him
red
eyed
and
very
scary.
His
booming
voice
echoed
through
the
eighth
grade
wing
scaring
all
the
sixth
graders
that
dared
to
enter
this
section
of
the
middle
school.
These
years
(sixth,
seventh,
and
eighth)
are
also
ironically
called
"grammar
school"
and
I
know
why.
Although
each
grade
consisted
of
math,
history,
gym,
French,
and
science
classes,
the
main
goal
of
all
underclassmen
was
to
suck
up
enough
knowledge
of
grammar
to
survive
through
Mr.
Goad's
eighth
grade
class.
We
all
wanted
to
make
it
to
the
exciting
world
of
high
school.
Although
my
sixth
and
seventh
grade
English
teachers
worked
us
thoroughly,
it
was
mainly
in
vain.
I
can't
think
of
anything
that
could've
prepared
me
for
the
first
day
of
Mr.
Goad's
class.
As
I
sat
in
my
miniature
desk,
I
stared
in
horror
as
he
shouted
about
our
assignments
for
the
year
and
where
we
needed
to
be
by
June.
One
specific
demand
that
turned
me
green
(there
were
many)
was
when
he
revealed
to
the
class
that
our
final
exam
would
consist
of
one
single
sentence.
We
would
have
to
locate
subjects,
verbs,
and
direct
objects,
place
the
correct
punctuation,
and
just
about
anything
else
anyone
could
possibly
pick
from
a
sentence.
If
there
was
one
single
error,
we
flunked
the
exam.
Visions
of
the
second
grade
spelling
test
flashed
before
my
eyes.
Needless
to
say,
there
was
no
test
of
any
sort
come
June.
Perhaps
it
was
forgotten.
Perhaps
it
was
just
meant
to
scare
all
my
classmates
into
studying
like
maniacs
all
year
long.
Whatever
the
case,
we
all
studied
like
maniacs
from
September
to
June.
Mr.
Goad
had
yet
another
requirement
for
his
class.
Vocabulary.
We
had
to
choose
ten
words
from
the
dictionary
every
week,
write
them
in
a
notebook
along
with
their
denotation.
Every
Friday
he
checked
the
notebook.
At
the
end
of
the
year
he
would
chose
one
word
from
our
whole
notebook
of
words
and
ask
us
the
meaning
of
the
word.
This
assignment
had
two
interesting
aspects.
The
first
was
that
Mr.
Goad
had
assigned
this
project
for
many
years
past.
"Vocab
books"
were
past
around
and
collected
like
Garbage
Pail
Kid
Cards.
As
I
slaved
over
dictionaries
weekly,
others
just
copied
from
the
notebooks
of
older
siblings
and
friends.
Some
even
had
the
audacity
of
turning
in
the
exact
notebook
without
changing
a
thing.
The
second
interesting
aspect
of
this
vocabulary
assignment
was
that
after
we
had
studied
and
learned
all
our
words
of
the
one
test,
we
discovered
the
sick
truth
that
there
was
no
test.
With
years
of
training
in
spelling,
handwriting,
vocabulary,
and
grammar,
there
came
a
time
in
my
little
life
where
I
had
to
produce
more
that
a
word,
comma,
sentence,
or
paragraph
at
a
time.
High
school
was
the
time
of
the
analytical
essay.
Assignments
consisted
of
reading
a
novel
and
analyzing
some
part
of
the
whole.
A
rigorous
pattern
was
sketched
out
which
we
followed
like
robots.
Each
paper
consisted
of
an
introduction
that
told
about
what
we
were
going
to
write,
three
to
five
paragraphs
in
which
each
had
quotes
and
proved
a
specific
point,
and
conclusion
that
summed
up
the
paper
without
repeating
the
introduction.
This
simple
plan
may
seem
simple
but
the
grading
was
much
more
complicated.
It
seemed
that
no
matter
how
closely
I
followed
the
pattern,
teachers
would
always
tell
me
"I
want
more,
go
deeper."
Personally,
I
never
felt
free
to
go
deep
at
all
when
following
such
a
rigorous
blueprint.
Writing
was
just
another
assignment
for
me.
What
do
I
mean
by
this?
Well,
being
forced
to
follow
certain
patterns
at
an
early
stage
in
a
writer's
life
causes
writing
to
lack
emotion.
There
is
no
flavor.
It
becomes
a
chore
very
similar
to
math
problems
and
science
labs.
What
should
have
been
discovered
is
the
overpowering
emotion
that
can
be
put
into
every
word.
We
should
have
learned
that
writing
is
a
release,
similar
to
painting.
The
creative
mind
of
young
high
schoolers
is
indeed
very
active.
We
should
have
been
given
a
piece
of
paper
and
been
told
to
write
about
yesterday,
or
tomorrow,
or
our
biggest
problems.
Don't
get
me
wrong.
I
am
not
saying
that
every
piece
of
writing
should
be
autobiographical
and
free
flowing
and
artistic.
I
am
not
saying
that
all
high
schoolers
should
become
writing
hippies
with
no
structure.
What
I
believe
is
that
this
kind
of
writing
should
have
been
incorporated
into
the
curriculum
rather
than
turning
students
off
to
writing
with
analytical
essays.
I
believe
these
kinds
of
essays
are
also
very
important
but
should
not
be
the
sole
form
of
writing
for
anyone.
Believe
me,
it
is
torture.
So
why
am
I
so
bitter
about
high
school?
I
guess
I
just
feel
that
I
was
being
pushed
back.
I
knew
I
wanted
to
be
a
writer
but
I
was
stuck
with
all
sorts
of
other
assignments.
It
felt
like
being
back
in
second
grade
when
I
was
forced
to
do
spelling
and
I
just
wanted
to
create
stories.
Teachers
made
me
feel
like
I
was
no
good.
Mrs.
Derwin
was
the
worst.
I
just
cringed
as
I
typed
her
name.
She
assigned
us
to
read
a
short
story
titled,
"Ms.
Brill."
It
was
a
good
story
but
I
struggled
for
a
topic
about
which
I
wanted
to
write.
I
went
in
for
a
meeting
and
Derwin
and
I
created
a
web
or
skeleton
for
my
paper.
I
went
home
and
wrote
it
over
the
next
week
and
turned
it
in
with
confidence.
When
I
got
it
back
I
had
received
a
"B-."
It
sounds
silly
but
grades
were
actually
life
or
death
in
high
school.
I
told
Derwin
that
I
wanted
to
get
a
better
grade
so
I
would
rewrite
the
paper.
I
met
with
her
again,
reworked
the
paper,
handed
it
in,
and
got
a
"B."
So
I
told
Derwin
that
I
wanted
to
get
a
better
grade
so
I
would
again
rewrite
the
paper.
I
met
with
her
again,
reworked
the
paper,
handed
it
in,
and
got
a
"B+."
This
pattern
continued
for
the
whole
semester.
Derwin
never
ever
gave
me
an
"A"
on
a
paper.
Perhaps
this
was
because
my
writing
was
not
"A"
level.
Perhaps
this
was
because
she
just
enjoyed
having
the
power
to
hold
back
what
I
wanted,
fan
it
in
front
of
my
nose,
and
never
give
it
to
me.
She
was
sick.
Writing
clicked
for
me
senior
year.
It
suddenly
became
a
passion.
It
is
as
difficult
for
some
to
understand
a
passion
about
writing
as
it
is
for
me
to
understand
a
passion
for
mathematics.
I
just
don't
get
it.
Graduating
high
school
I
felt
comfortable
with
my
own
writing
which
is
a
big
achievement.
I
knew
that
I
wanted
to
study
English
in
college
and
have
some
sort
of
writing
oriented
career.
So,
what
are
my
thoughts
on
my
experiences
now?
I
think
that
each
little
aspect
of
mastering
this
language
is
important.
Writing
consists
of
all
the
little
annoying
subjects
I
had
to
learn
throughout
school.
Without
letters
and
spelling
and
grammar
and
reading
and
literary
terms,
I
would
not
be
where
I
am
today.
All
those
pointless
textbooks
and
workbooks
got
me
where
I
am.
So
I
am
happy
about
that.
College
writing
is
much
different
than
high
school
for
one
reason.
There
is
no
pattern.
Most
professors
are
so
much
more
encouraging
and
want
to
hear
the
voice
of
the
writer,
even
in
an
analytical
essay.
It
has
renewed
my
passion
for
writing.
This
was
the
passion
in
second
grade
when
I
would
write
on
my
own.
It's
back.
And
I
know
that
I
have
a
bizarre
style
of
writing
that
you
might
not
like.
But
now,
instead
of
crying
over
a
B+
or
an
F,
I
will
take
that
much
as
one
would
take
a
criticism
of
ones
own
book.
It
is
just
another
piece
of
advice.
It
is
someone's
reflection
and
interpretation
of
the
writing.
A
"C"
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
the
writing
is
bad.
It
probably
means
that
more
editing
was
needed
or
the
assignment
wasn't
followed.
The
teacher
does
not
determine
whether
or
not
the
document
is
poor
writing.
That
falls
in
the
writer's
own
hands.
I
think
that
writing
is
the
basis
for
civilization.
Without
books
or
words,
very
few
of
the
professions
of
our
day
would
exist.
If
I
can
contribute
to
this
massive
collection
of
the
written
word
in
some
way,
my
career
goal
will
be
fulfilled.
I
am
not
out
for
fame.
Just
for
someone
to
be
influenced.
I
want
to
move
someone.
I
want
to
push
someone
further.
I
want
to
erase
the
ideas
that
high
school
teachers
put
in
their
student's
head.
So,
maybe
you
are
reading
this
right
now,
you
are
in
your
kitchen,
watching
you
child
make
a
mess
of
yogurt,
maybe
ice
cream,
or
maybe
pudding.
And
you
think
to
yourself,
I
should
scold
this
kid
for
making
such
a
mess.
Don't
do
it.
Just
take
a
deep
breath,
get
out
the
plastic
tablecloth
and
let
them
go
for
a
bit.
You
will
be
starting
them
off
on
the
right
track.
I
guarantee
that
they
will
want
to
learn
their
letters
if
they
get
to
make
a
mess.
Hey,
it
worked
for
me.
I
guess
that
sums
up
my
experiences
with
writing.
You
probably
hope
this
is
the
last
paragraph.
Don't
fret.
It
is.
