Prologue
Tales
of
princesses
in
distress,
reports
on
presidents,
and
analyses
of
Shakespeare
combine
to
form
a
portion
of
my
writing
development.
Individual
skills,
definitions,
knowledge,
and
confidence
are
necessary
to
allow
for
writing,
successful
or
not.
These
bits
of
knowledge
and
fundamental
steps
are
learned
beginning
in
early
childhood.
The
first
challenge
is
learning
the
twenty-six
individual
letters
of
the
alphabet:
names,
differences
between
capital
and
lowercase
letters,
and
the
alphabet
song.
From
this
progresses
the
forming
of
these
mysterious
shapes
into
sequences
called
words,
then
stringing
words
into
sentences.
Sentences
become
increasingly
complex
as
vocabularies
grow,
then
graduate
into
paragraphs.
The
next
challenges
come
in
determining
how
and
when
paragraphs
should
start
and
end.
As
schooling
progresses,
writing
can
become
a
chore
with
assignments,
grades,
topics,
and
other
limiting
factors.
Successful
writers
learn
to
remain
creative
while
respecting,
yet
stretching,
imposed
limits
and
boundaries.
Writers
never
achieve
perfection,
allowing
for
the
challenge
and
fun
of
writing
to
remain.
Yet,
the
most
enjoyment
comes
in
looking
back
on
progress
made
to
reach
the
skill
level
of
today.
Chapter

The
Formative
Years
Opening
the
second
drawer
of
the
abused
blue
filing
cabinet
in
Mom's
study,
I
voyage
into
my
past.
In
it,
Mom
has
saved
numerous
assignments
and
papers
from
my
years
of
writing.
The
first
well-handled
manila
folder
contains
my
life
prior
to
kindergarten.
My
first
attempts
at
writing
the
alphabet
(J
comes
before
I,
right?)
as
well
as
my
first
words,
me
and
cat,
suddenly
resurface.
Fumbled
efforts
at
forming
sentences
appear
next,
most
consisting
of
only
nouns.
As
pages
fall
away
to
reveal
others,
attempts
become
increasingly
successful
with
Mommy
comments
growing
more
enthusiastic.
Pictures
remain
effective
for
communication,
but
writing
is
quickly
developing.
Chapter

-
Elementary
School
Banishment
of
artwork
in
place
of
words
in
sentences
marked
the
beginning
of
kindergarten
and
formal
education.
The
development
of
sentences
became
more
advanced
as
kindergarten
segued
into
first,
second,
and
third
grades.
Parts
of
speech
were
taught,
but
the
meaning
of
a
noun
remained
people,
places,
and
things.
Life
was
uncomplicated
and
writing
remained
simple.
Writing
involved
three
word
sentences
about
vacations,
family,
pets,
or
a
topic
equally
enjoyable.
Spelling
was
the
focus
and
punctuation
consisted
of
periods.
Artistry
remained,
but
on
a
separate
page.
Upon
first
grade's
conclusion,
vocabularies
were
steadily
growing,
and
reading
and
writing
skills
followed
accordingly.
With
Mrs.
Warner
in
second
grade,
cursive
writing
was
introduced.
More
challenging
than
the
mastered
printed
letters,
cursive
meant
flowing
lines
and
curves.
At
least
that
is
how
the
workbook
examples
appeared.
Yet,
as
is
in
life,
skills
grew
with
time
and
practice.
Cursive
was
eventually
mastered,
then
used
in
reports.
The
library
was
reintroduced,
now
in
terms
of
research.
My
first
paper,
Flying
Squirrels,
emphasized
the
singular
point
that
flying
squirrels
are
actually
squirrels
with
flaps
of
skin
to
glide,
instead
of
wings
to
fly.
I
recall
feelings
of
pride
and
elation
when
my
teacher
congratulated
me
for
my
legible
cursive
and
my
well
formed
sentences,
as
written
in
the
grade
report.
Second
grade
also
brought
the
memorable
stories
of
the
Grease
Fire
and
The
Fire
Truck.
Both
evolved
from
an
oven
fire
on
Christmas
and
revealed
a
sequential
flow
not
present
in
previous
writings
as
well
as
sentences
formed
into
flowing,
recognizable
paragraphs.
To
me,
these
were
my
first
actual
pieces
of
writing.
The
progress
made
in
only
two
years,
from
the
struggle
to
create
comprehensible
sentences
to
the
joy
I
recall
at
writing
these
stories,
revealed
success.
They
are
among
my
best
experiences
as
a
writer
because
of
this,
but
also
because
of
teacher
praise
and
the
fact
Mom
saved
them.
In
fourth
and
fifth
grades,
book
reports
were
introduced.
Cut
and
dry
reports
of
what
had
been
read
gradually
transformed
into
carefully
worded
opinions
and
hints
toward
endings.
Intrigue
was
introduced
which
allowed
for
greater
creative
freedom
and
more
range
in
writing.
Yet
all
of
these
skills
are
additive
in
nature.
Practice
and
additional
knowledge
only
serve
to
improve
and
enhance
skills
to
form
a
better
communicator.
This
is
evident
as
the
voyage
through
middle
school
begins.
Chapter

-
Middle
School
Milk
carton
castles
and
toilet
paper
tube
mountains
helped
to
make
Mrs.
Hanna
my
favorite
teacher.
But
it
was
her
passion
for
writing
and
teaching
others
to
do
it
correctly
that
inspired
me.
The
notes
she
gave
in
sixth
grade
on
grammar,
style,
definitions
of
literary
terms,
public
speaking
and
more,
all
came
to
college
and
remain
a
useful
source
of
information.
It
was
also
in
this
year
that
research
reports
began.
I
wrote
reports
on
geography
while
making
a
model
of
an
imaginary
country,
on
farming
in
Mesopotamia
while
creating
a
model
with
people
that
actually
moved,
as
well
as
on
medieval
architecture
with
a
model
of
a
castle
that
contained
working
catapults.
Mrs.
Hanna
made
research
and
writing
enjoyable
by
introducing
it
slowly
and
adding
a
creative
aspect.
As
I
climb
into
the
attic,
the
models
remain,
covered
with
dust
and
growing
mildew.
The
reports
sit
safely
stored
under
Mom's
care.
While
peering
at
them,
the
hours
spent
on
the
living
room
floor
pouring
over
library
books,
as
well
as
those
spent
in
the
kitchen
with
newspaper
and
wallpaper
paste,
come
flooding
back
as
enjoyable
memories.
Chapter

High
School
Misspelling
pearl
and
writing
on
zebra
mussels
helped
make
ninth
grade
a
memorable
year.
Analytic
essays
were
the
focus
of
Mrs.
Cooper's
English
class,
and
it
was
the
year
of
The
Health
of
Keuka
Lake,
my
science
project.
In
English
class,
the
emphasis
was
placed
on
analysis
and
in-depth
discovery
of
works
read
in
class.
The
piece
I
recall
most
distinctly
was
on
Steinbeck's
The
Pearl.
In
this
particular
essay,
I
wrote
for
the
first
time
on
symbolism,
imagery,
character
development,
and
analysis
of
an
author's
style.
This
essay
is
especially
memorable
because
caught
up
in
the
new
aspects
of
this
writing,
I
incorrectly
spelled
pearl
throughout
the
piece.
Science
Congress,
a
regional
science
fair,
was
the
culmination
of
my
ninth
grade
science
project
for
Mr.
Messner's
Earth
Science
class.
The
report
was
the
first
piece
of
technical
writing
I
constructed,
the
presentation
the
most
significant
of
my
life.
In
this
process,
I
discovered
the
differences
between
technical
and
non-technical
writing,
and
gained
confidence
in
my
ability
to
do
both.
Through
judge
comments
on
my
clear
presentation
of
relevant
information
in
an
appropriate
manner,
and
noting
that
my
writing
was
a
reason
I
was
nominated
for
the
state
Science
Congress,
I
gained
assurance.
From
these
new,
formative
experiences,
my
writing
skills
were
distinctly
broadened.
Out
of
each
experience,
different
skills
and
pieces
of
knowledge
were
added
to
my
repertoire
for
further
refinement
and
use.
In
High
School,
the
focus
of
writing
shifted
to
more
intense
analysis
of
fiction,
short
stories,
and
poetry.
I
discovered
that
writing
could
remain
fun
and
interesting
despite
restrictions.
Due
to
this,
and
encouragement,
support,
and
a
helping
hand
from
Mrs.
Pope,
I
thrived.
One
result
of
this
confidence
was
a
tenth
grade
thesis
paper
analyzing
Tennyson's
poetry.
It
was
an
interesting
and
difficult
challenge,
as
I
had
never
attempted
analysis
of
poetry
as
intense
as
his
was,
or
written
a
thesis
paper.
Because
of
my
determination
and
teacher
support,
I
discovered
a
love
for
Lord
Alfred
Tennyson's
work
and
embedded
meanings.
This
success
on
a
personal
level,
and
from
the
view
of
Mrs.
Pope,
encouraged
the
use
of
Tennyson
as
the
focus
of
my
senior
thesis
paper
as
well.
With
each
paper,
I
grew
in
style,
technique,
and
ability.
More
importantly,
due
to
positive
feedback
and
enjoyment
of
writing,
my
confidence
soared.
Yet,
in
eleventh
grade,
my
most
difficult
challenge
presented
itself,
a
booklet
of
twelve
original
poems.
At
this
time,
illness
resulted
in
my
missing
large
amounts
of
school,
and
the
poetry
assignment
revealed
a
constructive
manner
for
me
to
release
myself.
The
resulting
booklet
was
my
secret
fears,
feelings,
joys,
and
memories.
Mr.
Hogan
pulled
me
aside
to
congratulate
me
on
the
success
I
had
in
the
project.
My
mother
cried
when
she
finally
understood
how
I
felt
on
different
issues
we
were
both
dealing
with
in
different
ways.
It
showed
me
that
writing
can
truly
express
emotions
and
be
self-healing.
Since
this
experience,
I
have
kept
a
journal
that
lets
me
express
myself.
Though
not
used
daily,
it
records
my
trials
and
triumphs,
the
rocky
roads
and
the
newly
paved,
and
serves
as
a
silent
friend
who
is
always
available.
My
experiences
in
High
School
shaped
my
appreciation
for
literature,
and
Ms.
Kearny
shaped
my
writing.
With
her
high
expectations,
my
writing
was
lifted
to
a
level
I
had
not
thought
possible.
Through
biweekly
free
writing
assignments,
my
creative
writing
skills
thrived.
Yet
focus
on
technical
details
such
as
grammar,
punctuation,
style
of
arguments,
and
analytical
techniques
remained
equally
important.
Ms.
Kearny
changed
focus
daily
from
research
methods,
styles,
and
do's
and
don'ts,
to
different
approaches
for
creating
points
in
arguments.
She
covered
all
those
dam
writing
genres,
as
she
referred
to
them,
multiple
times.
Ms.
Kearny
also
made
constructive
criticism
that
was
always
appropriate.
Her
notes
were
always
applicable
and
in
addition
to
equal
quantities
of
praise,
helpful
hints
were
included.
Best
yet,
she
noted
these
comments
in
a
book
for
herself
and
expected
improvements
in
these
areas
on
the
next
paper.
She
would
make
the
time
to
work
individually
with
students
to
provide
additional
guidance
and
support
beyond
what
she
could
provide
in
class.
She
cared
and
it
showed
through
the
time
and
effort
that
she
extended
on
each
assignment
for
every
student.
These
fond
memories
will
always
be
part
of
my
writing,
as
she
is
the
teacher
who
has
had
the
most
profound
effect
on
my
writing.
Chapter

-
College
Stepping
into
a
new
segment
of
life
is
always
nerve
wracking,
yet
I
was
confident
in
my
writing
abilities
going
into
this
transition.
Due
to
wonderful
teachers
and
their
individual
sprinkles
of
knowledge,
I
believed
myself
more
than
prepared.
In
my
FYS,
I
discovered
I
was
prepared,
even
more
than
I
had
first
believed.
My
first
college
writing
assignment
was
disappointing.
The
topic
was
unimportant,
and
the
WA
meeting
extremely
short
as
the
WA
added
very
little
and
told
me
the
paper
was
great.
Unsatisfied,
I
proceeded
to
revise
my
paper
as
done
in
high
school.
While
I
did
receive
an
A
on
the
paper,
due
to
previously
learned
and
practiced
skills,
I
was
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
additional
knowledge
I
had
received
in
the
WA
experience
and
the
poor
critiquing
of
the
final
draft.
It
was
refreshing
to
know
that
I
had
the
necessary
skills,
which
provided
confidence
and
security
in
my
bumpy
transition.
Still,
I
viewed
my
FYS
as
a
step
down
from
the
level
I
had
been
writing
at
the
previous
year.
The
structure,
flow,
style,
arguments,
and
support
were
not
critiqued
as
closely
as
Ms.
Kearney
had
done.
In
turn,
I
knew
I
didn't
need
to
exert
as
much
effort
to
get
an
A,
so
I
didn't.
I
was
disappointed
in
the
teacher
and
my
writing
lagged.
When
I
took
a
paper
home
at
Christmas
to
show
Ms.
Kearney,
she
critiqued
it
as
she
had
done
in
the
past
and
I
was
not
happy
with
the
results.
She
helped
me
realize
what
had
happened,
and
I
have
consciously
exerted
effort
since.
Chapter

-
Professional
Life
The
great
abyss
of
the
professional
world,
viewed
through
an
internship,
has
been
the
final
step
thus
far
in
my
writing
journey.
While
using
my
existing
writing
skills,
I
have
discovered
that
they
need
to
be
altered
once
more
for
the
purpose
of
marketing.
While
emphasis
remains
on
content,
wording
and
spin
become
a
more
integral
part
of
each
piece.
Brochures,
web
sites,
technical
articles,
and
application
notes
all
have
different
purposes
and
their
own
related
writing
style
and
approach.
This
summer
has
provided
me
with
more
writing
challenges,
and
in
doing
so
has
allowed
my
skills
to
flourish.
Epilogue
From
crayon
pictures
to
words
and
sentences
printed
in
pencil,
to
paragraphs
in
cursive
pen,
and
finally
to
essays
and
reports
typed
on
computers,
my
writing
has
developed.
The
evolution
is
evident
when
I
view
various
works
from
my
past.
As
I
close
the
manila
folders
and
place
them
back
into
the
cabinet,
I
pause.
While
these
works
show
the
progress
made
to
date
on
my
writing,
they
also
reveal
my
evolution
as
a
person.
What
will
come
next?
I
wonder
as
I
shut
the
blue
drawer
and
slide
out
of
the
room
and
back
into
the
present.
