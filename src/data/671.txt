Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative
Confidence
in
Writing
As
the
student
unenthusiastically
sunk
down
in
the
chair,
I
asked,
Nhow
did
you
feel
about
writing
this
paper?
What
was
your
process
like?O
The
response
to
which
was
almost
always
something
along
the
lines
of,
NNot
too
good.
I
hate
writingO
or
NAwful.
I
am
terrible
at
writing.O
Every
time
this
was
said
in
one
of
my
conferences,
I
could
not
help
but
remembering
saying
the
exact
thing
at
my
student-teacher
conferences
in
high
school.
Over
the
years,
my
relationship
with
writing
has
completely
changed,
however.
This
activity
or
process
which
I
used
to
completely
disdain
has
become,
over
the
years,
one
of
my
favorite,
stress-relieving
activities.
But
this
made
me
think,
why
have
I
enjoyed
writing
recently?
What
is
the
difference
between
me-now
and
this
student
who
still
fears
and
hates
writing?
After
my
first
year
of
being
writing
associate
and
after
reflecting
upon
my
first
two
years
at
Lafayette,
I
have
determined
that
confidence
and
perseverance
is
the
key
to
realizing
your
strength
as
a
writer,
and
consequently
succeeding
in
and
respecting
writing
as
process.
This
past
year,
my
sophomore
year,
was
my
first
as
a
WA.
I
was
so
excited
that
I
was
selected;
however,
I
also
became
increasingly
nervous
as
my
first
round
of
meetings
quickly
approached.
When
that
day
finally
arrived,
I
remember
walking
into
the
Watt
writing
room,
schedule
of
student
conferences
and
papers
in
hand.
As
my
first
student
sat
down,
I
desperately
tried
to
remember
everything
we
had
learned
in
our
training.
I
remembered
someone
telling
me
the
importance
of
coming
across
as
an
equal,
rather
than
a
hard-nosed
authority
figure
preaching
from
a
pedestal.
Therefore,
I
immediately
attempted
to
establish
myself
merely
as
a
peer
and
explained
to
them
how
I
had
only
just
recently
been
through
this
experience
myself.
I
explained
to
my
first
student
that
I
was
only
a
sophomore,
but
that
I
loved
writing
and
had
a
couple
things
I
would
like
to
discuss
about
their
paper.
As
I
went
through
my
conferences,
I
realized
that,
for
the
most
part,
they
were
getting
easier
and
easier.
Not
only
was
I
getting
a
handle
on
how
conferences
typically
go,
but
I
was
also
becoming
more
and
more
confident
about
my
own
grasp
of
the
writing
process.
With
every
paper
I
read,
I
could
look
back
and
find
it
on
the
timeline
of
my
own
development
in
writing.
For
example,
one
of
my
WA-ees
constantly
reminded
me
of
her
animosity
towards
any
form
of
writing
(besides
texting,
I
assume).
Therefore,
she
did
not
really
try
and
tended
to
put
every
assignment
off
until
the
very
last
minute.
When
I
read
her
papers
and
discussed
them
with
her,
I
was
reminded
of
myself
in
10th
grade.
Although
we
discussed
her
problems
being
succinct
and
fully
addressing
the
prompt,
I
really
thought
her
main
problem
was
simply
that
she
did
not
believe
in
her
writing,
just
as
I
failed
to
believe
in
mine.
This
seemed
to
be
the
common
thread
among
those
who
struggled
with
their
papers
or
failed
to
show
up
for
conferences;
they
simply
had
no
confidence
in
what
they
had
created.
Throughout
my
high
school
years
and
especially
in
college,
I
have
learned
important
lessons
about
writing
such
as
the
importance
of
grammar
and
the
power
of
a
great
thesis
statement.
One
thing
I
have
never
practiced
or
been
lectured
about,
however,
is
the
mental
or
emotional
effects
of
writing.
In
other
words,
I
have
always
been
well
aware
that
it
is
quite
easy
to
tell
through
sight
if
someone
is
annoyed
or
nervous.
I
had
never
realized,
however,
that
you
can
almost
sense
someoneOs
anxieties
and
lack
of
confidence
through
their
writing.
Being
a
writing
associate
has
taught
me
this.
Although
conferences
with
these
unsure
students
were
often
the
most
difficult
and
time
consuming,
they
also
tended
to
yield
the
most
results.
The
second
round
of
conferences
proved
to
be
the
most
frustrating.
It
seemed
that
a
lot
of
the
advice
I
had
given
out
had
gone
in
one
ear
and
went
out
the
other.
I
had
put
a
lot
of
effort
into
taking
notes
on
the
papers
and
giving
constructive
criticism,
yet
I
saw
the
same
mistakes
being
made
in
their
second
papers
and
I
was
not
sure
why.
I
discovered
the
mistake
I
had
made
in
one
of
our
weekly
meetings,
when
someone
mentioned
the
benefits
of
not
making
parks
on
the
studentsO
papers.
This
is
probably
the
best
advice
I
could
give
a
new
WA.
During
my
first
round
of
conferences,
I
would
present
the
student
their
paper
with
a
few
notes
and
circles
on
it
and
as
soon
as
I
handed
it
to
them,
I
would
immediately
lose
their
attention
as
they
looked
over
my
notes.
Therefore,
even
though
I
had
discussed
the
changes
they
should
make
for
their
next
paper,
my
advice
fell
on
deaf
ears
as
they
instead
focused
solely
on
correcting
what
I
had
circled.
After
realizing
this,
I
changed
the
way
I
handled
the
WA-eesO
papers.
I
respected
the
papers,
as
Professor
Tatu
had
said,
as
the
studentsO
property
and
left
only
a
few
reminders
for
myself
at
the
bottom
of
the
papers
and
this
made
all
the
difference.
Interestingly
enough,
these
lessons
I
had
taken
from
being
a
good
WA
and
holding
constructive
conferences
actually
helped
me
conference
myself
with
my
own
papers.
This
past
year,
I
took
a
class
called
Bioethics.
It
started
off
as
an
interesting
and
thought-provoking
class;
the
relevant
and
highly
controversial
issues
made
it
a
joy
to
attend.
However,
when
we
were
assigned
our
first
paper,
I
was
a
bit
panic-stricken.
The
professor
provided
us
with
a
page-long
prompt
detailing
a
sto
of
a
nurse
who
routinely
refuses
to
fill
prescriptions
for
the
pill
known
as
Plan
B.
The
professor
asked
us
to
take
a
position
on
whether
the
nurse
is
ethically
obligated
to
fill
the
prescription
if
there
is
no
other
nurse
on
duty
or
not
and
defend
it.
This
was
the
first
time
I
had
ever
received
a
prompt
like
this.
Not
only
was
the
prompt
controversial
and
intellectually
challenging,
but
I
also
had
no
idea
how
to
begin
developing
my
arguments.
As
I
began
to
write
my
paper,
the
advice
I
had
given
my
WA
students
suddenly
seemed
applicable
to
my
own
situation.
My
second
semester
as
a
writing
associate,
I
was
paired
with
a
class
on
gambling.
For
their
papers
they
were
instructed
to
take
a
side
on
whether
a
certain
form
of
gambling
should
be
legal
or
not
and
make
their
arguments
about
it.
As
I
held
my
conferences,
I
noticed
a
pattern.
The
students
were
having
a
hard
time
clearly
taking
a
side.
I
remember
myself
repeating
in
every
conference,
Nclearly
take
a
side.O
And
thatOs
exactly
what
I
had
to
do
in
this
new
and
challenging
situation.
After
working
as
a
writing
associate
this
year,
I
also
saw
my
own
writing
process
change
and
develop.
I
started
to
notice
that
many
of
the
students
I
worked
with
did
not
take
their
drafts
very
seriously.
This,
in
turn,
was
seriously
reflected
in
their
final
draft.
Those
who
spent
a
good
amount
of
time
making
their
first
draft
an
actual
complete
draft
had,
in
my
opinion,
the
strongest
final
papers.
I
have
always
been
pretty
good
at
writing
drafts,
but
being
a
WA
showed
me
that,
not
only
does
creating
a
draft
make
writing
the
final
easier,
but
it
also
makes
it
feel
more
put
together
and
sophisticated.
Therefore,
I
established
a
new
norm
for
my
own
writing
process.
Although
it
might
sound
extremely
odd
to
other
students,
I
discovered
that
I
do
my
own
personal
best
on
papers
if
I
have
a
complete
first
draft
finished
a
week
before
the
final
draft
is
due.
This
way,
I
have
a
full,
low
stress
week
to
take
my
time
and
make
my
revisions.
This
truly
did
relieve
a
lot
of
unnecessary
stress
and
unfortunate
late
nights.
Ultimately
being
a
WA
taught
me
a
lot
about
the
importance
of
having
a
process.
It
became
apparent
that
some
students
easily
misunderstand
what
the
professor
was
really
looking
for.
To
these
students,
I
eagerly
tried
to
explain
what
the
professor
had
told
me
and
suggested
that
they
go
talk
to
the
professor
themselves.
This
would
not
only
help
them
get
a
better
grasp
of
the
prompt,
but
would
also
show
the
teacher
that
they
are
giving
the
paper
their
best
effort.
After
realizing
the
importance
of
a
first
draft
and
settling
into
this
established
process
of
completing
a
draft
at
least
one
week
before
the
final
paper
is
due,
I
realized
that
this
is
also
beneficial
as
it
helps
me
listen
to
this
piece
of
my
own
advice.
Having
a
draft
due
early
gave
me
plenty
of
opportunities
to
take
it
to
my
professor
and
discuss
it.
Some
of
my
most
interesting
and
enlightening
conversations
I
have
had
during
college
were
my
one-on-one
talks
with
professors
about
my
papers.
The
only
way
to
have
this
time
with
professors
is
if
you
take
the
effort
to
really
work
through
a
draft
early
enough
to
meet
with
them
before
the
final
is
due.
Because
of
these
things
I
have
learned,
sometimes
I
think
that
I
have
actually
taken
more
from
being
a
WA
than
my
WA-ees
have.
Every
once
and
a
while
I
felt
like
the
WA-ees
had
not
listened
to
the
things
I
had
said;
however,
by
the
third
round
of
conferences,
I
really
felt
like
I
was
being
heard.
For
one
of
the
papers
my
second
semester
class
had
to
do,
the
students
were
asked
to
incorporate
two
theses
into
their
paper.
Needless
to
say,
this
caused
some
problems.
Many
of
the
students
had
no
idea
what
to
do
with
two
theses,
as
most
people
tend
to
rigidly
obey
the
typical
one
thesis,
five-paragraph
paper
paradigm.
However,
after
meeting
with
the
professor,
he
informed
me
that
he
was
hoping
for
the
students
to
be
creative
and
come
up
with
a
way
to
smoothly
integrate
a
second
thesis.
At
first,
these
conferences
were
quite
difficult.
Most
students
came
in
silent
and
only
upon
asking
did
they
tell
me
NI
had
no
idea
what
I
was
doing.O
This
is
where
I
used
another
piece
of
advice
offered
unto
me
by
my
fellow
WAOs:
embrace
the
silence.
Instead
of
telling
them
how
to
create
the
second
thesis
or,
more
importantly,
where
to
put
it,
I
was
silent.
Fearing
the
awkwardness,
most
students
desperately
tried
to
come
up
with
something.
That
was
when
I
heard
one
of
my
favorite
things
I
have
ever
heard
in
a
WA
conference:
Nhow
about
if
I
do
this?O
By
resisting
the
urge
I
had
to
talk
and
tell
them
what
I
would
do,
I
was
able
to
watch
the
student
creatively
strategize
how
they
would
deal
with
this
challenge.
Some
students
wanted
to
group
both
together
in
the
introduction
paragraph,
and
some
thought
it
would
be
logical
to
put
it
halfway
through
the
paper,
as
a
transition.
In
my
opinion,
this
paper
not
only
helped
the
students
adjust
to
different
collegiate
level
writing
assignments,
but
it
also
helped
me
realize
that
rules
that
are
drilled
into
our
heads
in
high
school
like
having
one
thesis
are
not
absolute.
Overall,
my
experience
as
a
writing
associate
has
been
a
great
one.
I
have
learned
more
about
writing,
reading,
teaching,
and
generally
conversing
than
I
ever
thought
I
would.
Although
I
was
initially
nervous
about
my
new
role
on
campus,
as
I
learned
more
and
became
more
confident
with
the
position,
I
not
only
became
a
better
WA,
but
also
a
better
writer,
and
student
in
general.
Being
a
writing
associate
has
also
helped
me
meet
a
lot
of
great
people.
From
the
four-hour
training
session
to
weekly
meetings,
the
Watt
writing
room
has
become
a
prime
place
to
meet
strong
students
and
talented
writers.
Other
writing
associates
have
always
offered
me
great
advice
for
conferences.
They
have
also
become
a
fantastic
resource
for
writing
papers
of
my
own.
As
I
previously
stated,
I
never
knew
how
important
a
role
confidence
plays
in
writing
before
becoming
a
WA.
Those
who
we
conference
with,
especially
first
years,
typically
seem
to
walk
into
a
conference
unenthusiastic,
preoccupied,
and
down
trodden.
However,
after
offering
a
few
quick
compliments,
I
have
found
that
the
student
will
typically
become
more
confident
and,
consequently,
open
to
offering
ideas
and
asking
thoughtful
questions.
I
think
that
I
have
helped
build
first
year
studentsO
confidence
with
respect
to
their
writing
and,
in
turn,
I
think
I
have
become
more
confident
in
my
writing
as
well.
There
have
been
several
times
where
I
have
thought,
I
really
am
making
a
difference
or
I
really
did
just
help
that
person.
For
example,
this
one
time
I
gave
a
student
a
small
suggestion,
and
she
instantly
became
more
excited,
asked
to
borrow
my
pen,
and
started
making
all
sorts
of
adjustments.
She
consequently
told
me
how
much
I
had
helped
her
and
asked
me
if
she
could
have
an
extra
meeting
with
me
before
the
paper
was
due.
Another
great
memory
of
being
a
WA
is
one
time
when
I
was
walking
through
the
library
I
saw
one
of
my
WA-ees
on
the
computer
working
on
his
essay
with
the
notes
that
I
had
written
down
from
our
conference
right
next
to
him.
I
remember
the
smile
that
came
across
my
face
when
I
saw
that.
Sometimes
I
worry
that
the
notes
I
have
taken
for
the
students
get
trashed
as
soon
as
they
leave
the
Watt
writing
room.
Seeing
this,
however,
made
me
realize
several
things.
Firstly,
that
I
am
a
good
writer.
Secondly,
that
the
writing
program
at
our
school
is
a
great
thing.
Thirdly,
that
I
can
help
people.
And
lastly,
that
with
a
little
bit
of
confidence,
anyone
can
be
a
great
writer.
