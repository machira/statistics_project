Writing
as
a
WA
2002-2003
Although
I
am
a
returning
WA,
I
was
not
employed
last
year.
Therefore,
my
writing
in
class
was
not
in
conflict
with
my
role
as
a
current
WA.
Yet
still,
my
writing
was
affected
by
my
previous
experiences
as
a
WA
and
my
conferences
were
enhanced
with
the
lessons
I
had
learned
the
year
before.
As
a
Chemical
Engineer,
I
feel
that
my
place
in
the
writing
program
is
rather
unique.
Unlike
other
departments,
engineers
practice
an
entirely
different
style
of
writing,
one
that
is
extremely
technical
and
full
of
analysis.
At
first,
I
felt
that
a
WA
was
unnecessary
to
engineering
classes
and
even
sometimes
burdensome.
However,
after
serving
as
a
WA
for
one
year
and
then
taking
engineering
writing
classes
this
past
year,
my
perception
has
somewhat
changed.
Although
I
am
sure
that
I
will
still
feel
removed
from
certain
writing
topics
this
upcoming
semester,
my
previous
experiences
should
allow
me
to
shed
light
on
a
form
of
writing
many
other
majors
are
unfamiliar
with.
Last
fall,
I
was
enrolled
in
Chemical
Engineering
Lab
I,
my
only
writing
course
of
the
semester.
The
course
responsibilities
involved
writing
two
lab
reports,
each
with
a
minimum
of
approximately
thirty
pages.
I
was
completely
overwhelmed
at
the
sight
of
this
task
on
the
syllabus,
but
I
for
some
reason
still
approached
the
situation
with
an
open
mind.
At
the
beginning
of
the
semester,
each
student
was
assigned
two
experiments
that
they
would
be
solely
responsible
for
writing
up.
A
prelab
was
to
be
written
and
submitted
a
week
before
the
actual
lab
in
order
to
inform
the
lab
partners
of
their
duties
and
responsibilities.
The
prelab
was
often
about
six
to
eight
pages
in
length
and
included
a
detailed
introduction
of
all
pertinent
background
information,
including
figures
and
equations.
In
addition,
the
apparatuses
and
reagents
were
listed
and
described
and
an
experimental
plan
was
proposed,
introducing
each
variable
separately.
This
initial
writing
assignment
was
intimidating
and
therefore
difficult
to
begin.
I
needed
to
find
a
more
extensive
research
methodology
if
I
ever
hoped
to
write
a
successful,
thorough
introduction.
This
is
where
being
a
WA
proved
helpful.
In
my
FYS
and
again
through
WA
training
and
meetings,
I
was
introduced
to
the
research
librarians
in
our
college
library.
Unbeknownst
to
me
at
the
time,
there
exists
an
online
web
page
on
the
library
website
for
each
academic
department.
Therefore,
by
looking
up
the
Chemical
Engineering
page,
I
was
able
to
limit
my
search
to
only
those
materials
that
would
be
academically
acceptable.
After
writing
the
prelab
and
then
performing
the
experiment,
I
faced
the
daunting
task
of
writing
the
actual
report.
The
page
limit
concerned
me
at
first
but
as
I
started
to
write
the
rough
draft,
I
realized
there
was
actually
too
much
information.
Lab
reports
are
broken
into
specific
sections,
or
subheadings:
introduction,
apparatuses,
reagents,
experimental
procedures,
results,
discussion,
improvements,
and
conclusions.
Unlike
the
advice
I
offered
as
a
WA,
this
style
of
writing
does
not
require
a
clear
thesis
statement
of
the
traditional
type,
but
rather
distinct
categories
of
scientific
analysis.
Therefore,
when
I
met
with
my
WA,
I
did
not
know
how
to
approach
the
conference.
What
would
we
discuss?
I
was
mainly
concerned
with
my
content
and
my
analysis,
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong
or
needed
improvements.
However,
this
is
not
the
duty
or
the
responsibility
of
the
WA,
so
the
conference
obviously
focused
on
organization.
Because
I
am
confident
in
my
writing
ability
and
since
I
myself
was
a
WA,
I
did
not
find
these
conferences
to
be
very
helpful.
They
were
simply
a
check
on
my
ability.
Another
conference
like
this
one
took
place
as
I
was
writing
the
second
lab
report
and
in
my
opinion,
it
was
even
less
necessary
than
the
first
one
because
I
was
accustomed
to
the
writing
process.
However,
I
used
the
conference
as
an
opportunity
to
improve
my
skills
as
a
WA,
listening
to
what
my
WA
had
to
say
and
how
she
handled
the
situations.
These
were
the
only
instances
I
had
fall
semester
with
the
writing
program.
My
technical
writing
skills
greatly
improved
and
I
felt
prepared
for
the
tasks
associated
with
Chemical
Engineering
Lab
II.
In
the
spring,
I
was
again
enrolled
in
only
one
so-called
writing
course
D
Engineering
Professionalism
and
Ethics.
However,
Lab
II
once
again
included
a
lot
of
technical
writing.
My
ethics
class
required
about
three
or
four
short
papers
in
the
form
of
memos
reflecting
upon
my
response
to
a
certain
issue
or
seminar.
In
addition,
four
drafts
on
the
same
topic
were
written,
each
time
expanding
on
the
previous
work.
This
type
of
writing
was
more
in
the
tradition
of
the
writing
program,
including
a
thesis
statement,
research,
and
analysis
of
the
ethical
dilemma.
This
assignment
proved
to
be
very
difficult
because
I
was
out
of
practice
with
such
writing.
Composing
a
coherent
sensible
thesis
statement
proved
to
be
a
great
obstacle
and
I
took
advantage
of
my
WA
to
seek
advice.
Other
complications
I
ran
into
included
content,
specifically
distinguishing
between
important
details
and
irrelevant
ones,
and
supporting
evidence,
mainly
using
a
tone
that
was
objective
but
also
persuasive.
The
writing
program
helped
me
to
reflect
on
my
abilities
as
a
prior
WA
and
instilled
some
confidence
in
my
writing
as
I
was
composing
a
draft
out
of
my
comfort
zone.
Although
not
a
writing
course,
Chemical
Engineering
Lab
II
proved
to
be
an
extensive
writing
class.
Throughout
the
semester,
we
were
required
to
write
three
prelabs
and
three
lab
reports,
each
of
the
same
technical
prose.
The
style
was
something
I
was
already
used
to,
but
the
content
introduced
a
new
aspect
to
writing:
design
of
experiments.
We
were
required
to
design
our
own
experiment
for
a
given
apparatus,
and
thus
the
prelab
focused
on
instructions
for
operation.
Just
like
writing
a
set
of
directions
or
a
help
manual,
the
instructions
had
to
be
clear,
precise,
and
accurate.
Because
a
WA
was
not
assigned
to
the
course,
I
relied
on
my
previous
knowledge
as
a
WA
for
guidance.
I
first
used
the
advice
I
give
other
students,
which
is
to
form
a
working
outline.
Drafting
up
a
rough
copy
and
giving
it
to
a
friend
to
read
is
also
helpful.
Even
if
that
friend
knows
nothing
of
what
you
are
saying,
he
or
she
will
be
able
to
tell
you
if
your
word
choice
is
clear
and
sensible.
I
also
did
some
other
writing
spring
semester
outside
of
Lafayette
College.
I
was
applying
for
summer
research
openings
in
the
REU
programs
at
different
universities
throughout
the
country.
Each
application
included
a
personal
statement,
discussing
my
research
interests
and
desire
to
be
accepted
to
the
program.
This
type
of
writing
is
unlike
any
writing
done
in
the
classroom.
I
needed
to
come
across
as
a
distinguished,
intelligent,
determined
student
without
sounding
conceited.
Such
a
task
is
often
difficult
for
many
people,
but
I
used
some
experiences
learning
in
WA
conferences
to
assist
me.
For
example,
for
a
positive
aspect
in
all
conferences,
I
often
ask
the
student
what
their
favorite
part
of
the
paper
is
or
what
they
feel
they
did
exceptionally
well.
Thus,
I
looked
at
my
writing
from
the
third
person
and
read
it
to
myself
in
an
objective
manner.
Such
ability
really
helped
me
compose
a
successful
personal
statement.
Over
the
summer,
I
worked
in
a
bioengineering
lab
at
Georgia
Institute
of
Technology
doing
research
on
blood
vessels.
The
program
requirements
included
writing
a
scientific
research
paper
for
possible
publication
and
putting
together
a
PowerPoint
presentation.
I
was
extremely
familiar
with
the
presentation
aspect,
but
I
was
never
introduced
to
the
writing
format.
First
of
all,
the
research
level
was
extremely
high.
The
content
was
difficult
to
understand,
and
thus
even
more
difficult
to
paraphrase.
I
struggled
with
the
composition
and
used
my
mentor
as
a
knowledgeable
source,
almost
as
a
WA.
I
eventually
produced
a
satisfactory
paper,
but
not
without
some
struggle
along
the
way.
This
experience
is
sure
to
bring
some
valuable
advice
to
the
table
this
fall.
I
can
relate
to
how
my
students
may
feel
at
the
sight
of
their
first
writing
assignments,
and
I
can
use
the
method
I
used
to
accomplish
such
a
difficult
writing
task
as
an
example
to
guide
them.
Over
the
past
year,
my
writing
has
improved
ten-fold.
I
have
experimented
with
different
styles
and
different
subjects
and
exposed
myself
to
all
sorts
of
ideas.
Using
my
previous
knowledge
of
being
a
WA
helped
me
to
develop
my
ideas
and
structure
my
papers.
My
experiences
as
the
writer
this
past
year
has
shown
me
how
to
overcome
writerOs
block,
difficult
tasks,
and
intimidating
assignments.
As
a
result,
my
conferences
as
a
WA
this
upcoming
semester
should
be
full
of
experience,
knowledge,
and
wisdom.
I
will
hopefully
draw
upon
all
my
writing
experiences
to
help
the
students
I
am
working
with,
as
well
as
the
current
WAOs
I
encounter
in
staff
meetings
and
elsewhere.
We
each
share
separate
stories
and
possess
unique
histories
as
writers.
Only
when
we
reflect
upon
our
own
strengths
and
evaluate
our
weaknesses
will
the
program
truly
become
beneficial
for
all
of
us.
