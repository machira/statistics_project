My
Literary
History
V.
August
28,
1995
In
order
to
best
describe
my
growth
in
literacy,
I
think
that
I
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
first
time
that
I
spoke.
I
believe
that
writing
is
simply
another
form
of
communication,
and
therefore
the
first
time
I
spoke
was
the
beginning
of
my
communication
history
and
my
literacy
history.
My
mother
reminds
me
that
I
said
my
first
words
when
I
was
only
four
months
old
and
was
able
to
put
together
entire
comprehensible
sentences
by
the
age
of
six
months.
I
was
evident
to
me
that
even
at
a
very
young
age,
I
had
an
overwhelming
desire
to
communicate
with
others,
whether
it
be
through
spoken
words
or
written
words.
There
is
no
doubt
that
the
desire
to
communicate
has
always
fired
my
soul,
but
I
remember
as
I
was
growing
up
and
maturing
in
my
communication
skills,
my
desire
to
write
effectively
far
outweighed
my
ability
to
write
effectively,
or
so
I
thought.
I
often
considered
that
the
most
detrimental
aspect
to
my
ability
to
write
entered
my
life
about
a
year
and
a
half
after
I
was
born,
her
name
is
Sarah.
Sarah
Roseanne
is
my
younger
sister
and
has
been
the
single
reason
why
to
this
day,
I
am
still
striving
to
write
and
communicate
to
the
best
of
my
ability
which
I
know
pales
in
comparison
to
her
ability.
Sarah
and
I
because
we
are
so
close
in
age,
have
always
been
intense
rivals.
No,
she
was
not
the
loving
and
perfect
little
sister
who
would
adore
an
older
wiser
and
more
experienced
older
sister,
but
instead
she
was
a
nuisance
who
challenged
everything
that
I
ever
did,
especially
my
writing.
This
paper
will
focus
on
the
comparison
between
her
natural
skill
as
a
writer
and
my
learned
writing
skills
which
believe
me
do
not
come
naturally.
I
remember
as
a
child
that
I
was
the
first
one
who
could
write
my
name,
spell
out
loud,
and
in
first
grade
I
even
knew
what
a
paragraph
was.
My
sister
on
the
other
hand
would
not
find
out
information
like
that
for
at
least
another
year.
I
knew
the
technicalities
of
a
paragraph
and
how
they
were
supposed
to
look
and
even
approximately
how
many
sentences
were
supposed
to
be
in
one
paragraph
in
order
for
the
teacher
to
consider
it
correct,
but
with
all
of
my
overwhelming
trivial
knowledge
about
the
structure
of
a
paragraph
one
thing
still
troubled
me.
I
never
really
knew
what
to
put
in
my
paragraph.
I
had
the
desire
to
write
the
paragraph,
but
what
about?
I
remember
that
my
teacher
never
took
off
credit
while
grading
my
papers
because
of
form,
but
creativity
was
always
lacking.
My
sister,
Sarah,
on
the
other
hand
did
not
have
the
same
problem.
From
the
fist
time
that
she
picked
up
a
pen
to
write
her
name
she
even
did
that
creatively.
Through
the
first
few
years
of
grade
school,
I
was
praised
for
the
accuracy
with
which
my
papers
were
written,
while
my
sister
was
praised
for
the
content
which
her
papers
contained.
I
remember
in
the
fourth
grade,
I
was
told
to
write
a
Thanksgiving
story.
I
wrote
about
the
pilgrims
and
the
Indians,
just
as
I
had
always
heard
the
story.
I
made
sure
that
my
sentences
were
not
run-ons
and
that
my
adjectives
were
all
well
placed.
The
paper
was
reviewed
by
my
teacher
and
I
received
an
A-.
I
was
happy
about
my
efforts
that
is
until
the
next
year
when
my
sister
was
in
fourth
grade
and
she
was
given
the
same
assignment,
but
she
wrote
about
thanksgiving
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
food
that
the
pilgrims
and
indians
would
be
eating.
She
explained
how
happy
the
food
was
to
be
a
part
of
such
a
wonderful
event.
She
received
the
same
A-,
but
her
paper
was
not
grammatically
correct
like
mine
in
fact
it
had
all
types
of
red
marks
covering
it,
but
she
still
received
an
A-.
The
teacher
had
remarked
how
creative
her
paper
was
and
how
much
ingenuity
that
she
put
into
it.
How
could
that
be?
I
wondered.
Slowly
I
learned
that
creativity
was
just
as
important
to
the
writing
process
as
were
the
rules
and
regulations
that
defined
good
writing
skills.
As
the
years
progressed,
my
skills
and
my
sister's
skills
became
even
more
defined
and
polarized.
I
learned
that
my
forte
was
not
writing
poems
and
abstract
genres,
but
instead
I
specialized
in
research
papers.
I
practiced
the
art
of
defining
the
problem
and
implementing
arguments
in
the
thesis
and
drawing
thoughtful
conclusions.
In
contrast
my
sister
never
practiced
a
thing.
She
wrote
beautiful
poems
that
simply
rolled
off
of
the
tongue.
She
kept
a
diary
from
the
age
of
ten
years
old.
She
wrote
beautiful
thank
you
cards
to
friends
and
relatives.
I
tried
to
do
the
same.
I
had
practiced
creative
things
on
my
own.
In
fact
when
this
specific
assignment
was
given,
I
took
out
my
old
diary
and
started
to
read
it.
In
the
diary
I
even
wrote
correctly.
I
wrote
entire
sentences
which
took
the
form
of
paragraphs.
I
wrote
about
daily
happenings,
but
not
my
daily
feelings.
I
remember
sneaking
into
my
sister's
room
when
I
was
twelve
and
reading
her
diary.
It
was
filled
with
stream
of
consciousness
writings
about
her
feelings,
her
dreams,
and
her
hopes.
The
diary
was
nothing
like
my
own.
It
was
creative
not
narrative.
I
wrote
poems
that
rhymed
perfectly
but
had
no
feeling
behind
them.
I
had
once
again
learned
the
mechanics
of
a
certain
genre,
but
not
the
background
that
makes
a
poem
poetry.
My
sister
was
born
with
the
knowledge
of
how
to
create
poetry
and
not
simply
write
a
poem.
My
skills
of
writing
creatively
were
first
seriously
challenged
in
high-school.
Because
I
had
learned
the
grammar
rules
and
writing
specifications,
I
was
placed
in
the
upper
level
English
courses
to
no
one's
surprise,
I
did
very
well
that
is
until
our
teachers
started
assigning
creative
work.
I
struggled
daily.
I
remember
asking
my
sophomore
English
teacher
if
she
could
assign
me
a
different
project
because
we
had
to
write
our
own
epitaphs.
I
was
under
pressure.
An
epitaph
had
to
be
creative
and
well
written,
and
it
would
be
graded.
This
time
I
would
not
be
graded
on
grammar
and
syntax
but
on
creativity.
I
never
tried
and
tried
to
write
that
epitaph
but
to
no
avail.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
felt
that
I
was
a
bad
writer
who
did
not
have
the
ability
to
keep
up
with
the
other
English
students
who
had
learned
to
combine
creativity
with
good
writing
skills.
I
shied
away
from
the
English
oriented
classes.
I
began
taking
classes
such
as
math
and
science
courses
which
required
research
and
analysis,
but
not
creativity.
My
teachers
always
commented
on
how
well
I
wrote
my
labs
and
research
papers.
Finally
I
felt
as
though
I
had
accomplished
something
with
my
English
writing
skills.
My
sister
on
the
other
hand
began
taking
every
English
course
offered.
She
steered
away
from
science
and
math
classes
so
that
she
could
put
her
creative
talents
to
work
for
her.
In
high-school
I
assumed
that
my
writing
skills
would
shape
my
life.
Because
I
was
not
a
good
creative
writer,
I
thought
that
I
would
study
either
science
or
math
in
college
just
like
I
assumed
that
my
sister
would
become
an
English
major
when
she
went
to
college.
I
was
wrong.
When
I
was
a
senior
in
high-school,
a
teacher
asked
me
once
again
to
be
a
part
of
the
upper
level
English
course.
I
apprehensively
agreed
knowing
that
I
would
struggle
to
be
creative.
On
the
other
hand
the
teacher
did
not
insist
that
I
be
creative,
instead
she
used
my
logic
to
present
the
other
side
of
the
argument.
Once
again
I
was
proud
of
the
work
that
I
was
doing
in
my
English
class.
I
realized
that
even
though
I
was
not
as
creative
as
some
of
the
other
students
and
not
even
nearly
creative
as
my
sister,
my
ideas
were
important
in
the
classroom
and
even
necessary
to
a
logical
argument.
It
was
even
ironic
to
see
that
my
sister
decided
to
become
a
science
major
in
college
while
I
am
an
AB
major.
College
is
the
most
recent
chapter
in
my
literary
history
and
my
struggle
to
communicate
with
others.
When
I
entered
college
I
was
somewhat
weary
about
the
demands
that
would
be
asked
of
me
by
my
professors.
I
knew
that
one
of
my
first
projects
would
be
to
write
a
fifteen
page
research
paper
for
my
first
year
seminar.
I
was
so
relieved
that
I
had
signed
up
for
a
first
year
seminar
because
I
heard
what
I
thought
were
horror
stories
from
friends
who
talked
about
writing
prose
and
poetry
as
well
as
keeping
a
journal.
I
was
painfully
reminded
of
my
boring
diary
from
younger
years.
I
swore
that
I
would
be
more
willing
to
write
one
hundred
papers
that
were
fifteen
or
more
pages
then
to
through
a
class
where
I
was
graded
on
my
creativity.
My
fifteen
page
paper
turned
out
beautifully.
I
used
my
skill
as
a
writer
to
put
together
a
strong
and
well
defined
thesis
as
well
as
good
straight
forward
arguments
that
clearly
backed
up
the
thesis.
There
was
absolutely
no
creativity
involved.
I
was
thrilled.
Unfortunately
I
did
so
well
that
I
was
placed
in
an
English
class
for
freshmen
who
were
planning
to
major
in
English.
I
was
once
again
challenged
with
the
c
word,
creativity.
I
was
sure
that
I
would
receive
my
first
failing
grade
in
that
class.
I
just
did
not
have
the
same
insight
as
the
rest
of
the
students.
It
was
in
that
class
that
I
realized
that
I
was
right
I
did
not
have
the
same
insight,
but
instead
I
had
a
different
insight
into
situations
that
was
just
as
important
as
theirs.
I
had
a
logical
way
of
writing
that
I
could
finally
be
proud
of.
I
warned
the
teacher
of
my
personal
writing
styles
and
she
was
more
than
happy
to
read
my
works
with
an
open
mind.
She
even
told
me
that
she
looked
forward
to
reading
my
papers
only
because
they
were
so
different
and
analytical.
I
had
found
my
nitch.
Now
as
I
look
back
on
my
literary
history
I
am
amazed
how
long
it
has
taken
me
to
realize
that
I
should
take
pride
in
the
way
that
I
write
instead
of
simply
trying
to
imitate
creative
writers.
I
still
adore
my
sister's
poems
which
she
nows
gives
me
as
a
gift
every
Christmas,
but
I
realize
that
there
are
many
ways
to
write,
be
it
creative,
logical,
i
llogical,
stream
of
consciousness,
etc.
Each
style
has
its
own
value,
and
every
person
has
their
own
style.
As
long
as
one
finds
the
best
way
that
they
write
and
do
it
well,
they
should
be
proud
of
their
own
literary
history.
