Literacy
Narrative
The
setting
was
always
the
same.
However,
each
Sunday
was
different
from
the
next
when
I
would
sit
upon
my
grandfather's
knee
while
my
mind
experienced
something
new.
Sunday
was
my
day
to
spend
with
my
grandfather,
whom
I
called
Pe-Pa.
Each
morning
before
our
visit
to
the
local
diner
for
breakfast,
he
introduced
me
to
the
wonderful
world
of
reading.
This
ritual
occurred
habitually
every
Sunday,
hut
when
it
began
exactly,
I
do
not
recall.
What
I
do
remember
is
the
crumpled,
disorganized
sheets
of
various
sections
from
The
New
York
Times
which
left
smears
of
black
ink
on
my-soft,
-small
hands.
At
the
commencement
of
our
ritual,
my
grandfather
would
take
a
section
from
the
paper,
usually
advertisements
and
he
would
begin
by
pointing
out
letters.
He
would
continue
to
explain
how
the
combination
of
these
letters
with
others
like
them
magically
produced
sentences
which
people
could
understand
simply
by
reading
them.
The
images
amazed
me
and
I
longed
to
familiarize
myself
with
the
different
shapes
which
these
letters
resembled.
I
wanted
to
know
how
these
words
were
created.
In
addition,
I
yearned
to
understand
what
they
meant
and
how
I
could
participate
in
their
creation.
My
grandfather's
method
was
definitely
a
success
since
he
introduced
me
to
reading,
followed
by
writing,
at
a
such
a
young
age.
My
mind
was
like
a
sponge,
eager
to
absorb
the
vast
amount
of
knowledge
which
surrounded
me.
We
practiced
reading
sections
of
the
newspaper
each
and
every
Sunday,
followed
by
a
doughnut
at
the
diner,
my
reward
for
continuing
to
show
an
interest
in
the
learning
process.
In
my
eyes,
my
grandfather's
dedication
to
my
literacy
had
a
significant
impact
on
how
I
perceive
it
today.
He
took
the
time
to
introduce
me
to
an
art
so
valuable
at
such
a
young
age
before
I
was
distracted
by
the
countless
ways
a
child
can
find
entertainment.
I
still
rode
my
bike,
jumped
rope,
and
played
house,
but
in
addition
I
learned
to
read,
which
prompted
me
to
write.
It
was
in
the
fourth
grade
that
I
truly
grew
to
love
writing.
At
the
end
of
each
section
in
our
spelling
books
there
were
instructions
for
students
to
write
a
paragraph
based
on
a
scenario
provided
by
the
book.
This
assignment
was
followed
by
groans
from
students
and
ubiquitous
complaints,
although
I
remained
silent,
upset
that
the
spelling
book
asked
us
to
write
only
a
paragraph.
I
anticipated
the
end
of
each
spelling
chapter,
eager
to
create
a
new
melodrama.
While
my
classmates
were
handing
in
single
sheets
of
loose-leaf
paper
with
practically
nothing
but
a
mere
splatter
of
ink,
I
was
submitting
several
sheets
which
needed
to
be
stapled
to
stay
together.
I
introduced
a
multitude
of
characters
and
created
make-believe
towns
where
problem
after
problem
arose,
causing
the
need
to
continue
writing.
Mrs.
Andrews,
the
elderly
teacher
who
assigned
these
writing
samples
noticed
my
passion
for
writing.
She
encouraged
me
to
write
as
much
as
1
could,
until
my
hand
hurt
and
1
felt
that
1
could
write
no
longer.
I
remember
leaving
the
fourth
grade
on
that
last
day
of
school
with
a
thick,
green,
bulging
folder
on
which
I
wrote
in
my
most
perfect
script,
My
Stories."
Now
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
a
pile
of
folders
which
contain
other
pieces
of
writing
that
I
have
accumulated
over
the
years.
My
family
was
also
well
aware
of
my
love
for
writing,
considering
that
1
would
read
most
of
what
I
wrote
to
my
father
because
he
honestly
critiqued
my
work.
One
summer
when
I
was
thirteen,
my
family
spent
a
few
weeks
on
the
Jersey
Shore.
While
we
were
there
my
father
bought
me
a
maroon,
five
ring
notebook
in
which
I
could
continue
to
write
while
I
was
away
from
home.
It
was
in
this
specific
notebook
that
I
began
developing
a
story
that
I
envisioned
would
someday
become
a
best-selling
novel.
The
plot
was
modeled
after
the
pre-teen
books
which
I
read
religiously
during
this
stage
in
my
life,
and
it
involved
a
girl
who
discovered
that
she
had
a
twin
sister
who
had
passed
away.
Since
I
had
read
so
many
Nancy
Drew
novels,
I
added
an
extra
twist
and
made
the
long
lost
sister
return
to
guide
her
twin
through
her
tumultuous
teenage
years.
I
was
impressed
by
my
creativity
with
this
short
story
and
eager
to
have
someone
read
it.
I
have
always
enjoyed
having
other
people
read
my
work,
although
this
specific
story
was
critiqued
by
my
older
brother
s
best
friend
who
was
vacationing
with
our
family.
Dave
was
smart,
good-looking,
incredibly
friendly
and
three
years
older
than
I.
Coincidentally,
I
had
a
huge
crush
on
him
and
was
elated
when
he
asked
if
he
could
read
what
I
had
been
writing
continuously
all
week
I
felt
honored,
yet
nervous
to
have
someone
as
intelligent
as
Dave
read
my
story,
fearful
that
he
would
mock
my
childish
scenarios,
but
I
agreed
anyhow.
Suprisingly,
he
seemed
entertained
as
he
read
about
Gabriella,
the
main
character's
disastrous
adolescent
experiences,
ranging
from
being
excluded
from
cliques
to
shopping
for
an
outfit
for
a
dance.
When
he
finished
reading
I
remember
him
simply
saying
that
he
was
impressed
by
my
motivation.
Here
I
was,
a
thirteen
year
old
girl
trying
to
write
a
novel
on
my
summer
vacation,
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
my
only
two
free
months
from
school.
Consequently,
the
fact
that
he
had
taken
the
time
to
read
something
I
had
mitten
made
me
feel
special
for
continuing
to
demonstrate
such
a
passion
for
writing.
He
asked
me
to
show
him
the
final
draft
when
it
was
completed,
although
I
never
did.
The
rough
draft
still
remains
in
my
now
dilapidated
five
ring
notebook.
However,
the
final,
shorter
draft
I
typed
on
my
brother's
then
high
tech
Apple
2E
computer
and
placed
it
in
a
folder
with
some
of
my
other
stories.
I
read
it
a
few
years
ago
and
instantly
I
was
reminded
me
of
the
afternoon
that
Dave
became
another
inspiration
who
increased
my
love
for
writing.
Throughout
middle
school,
I
continued
to
display
a
tremendous
interest
in
writing.
My
eighth
grade
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Ishkanian
was
an
eccentric
woman
who
wore
long,
flowing,
floral
skirts
and
interesting
jewelry.
English
was
her
passion,
and
she
longed
to
make
it
her
students'
as
well.
The
other
teacher
who
taught
all
of
the
other
eighth
grade
sections,
focused
entirely
on
grammar,
while
Mrs.
Ish
concentrated
more
on
creative
writing
rather
than
prepositions
and
compound
sentences.
For
example,
every
student
was
required
to
write
in
journals
every
day,
allowing
us
to
write
about
whatever
we
desired
and
each
week
we
completed
a
new
short
story
by
either
using
our
imaginations
or
developing
a
topic
suggested
by
Mrs.
Ishkanian.
When
I
think
back
to
my
English
class
that
year,
I
immediately
envision
Mrs.
Ish
reading
a
poetry
passage
to
a
class
of
gawky
and
somewhat
confused
teenagers.
She,
like
my
grandfather
yearned
to
make
others
recognize
the
brilliance
and
never
ending
capacity
of
the
English
language.
Not
only
did
she
expose
many
different
facets
of
writing,
but
she
encouraged
all
of
us
to
discover
our
individual
abilities
through
the
creative
avenues
she
traveled
in
her
efforts
to
teach
our
class.
During
middle
and
high
school,
and
now
even
in
college,
I
have
used
writing
as
a
form
of
expression.
It
is
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
easier
ways
to
communicate
my
emotions
when
mere
speech
will
not
suffice.
Once
I
begin
writing,
I
find
it
hard
to
stop.
In
my
closet
at
home,
there
is
a
huge
shopping
bag
which
holds
all
of
the
journals
I
have
ever
kept,
beginning
with
the
sixth
grade.
Now
that
I
am
older,
I
find
it
more
difficult
to
find
time
when
I
can
express
my
feelings
through
writing.
Lately
I
haven't
been
writing
in
my
journal
as
much
as
I
would
like
to
be,
although
the
amount
of
pages
I
have
covered
describing
my
thoughts,
fears,
hopes,
and
dreams
over
the
years
is
unbelievable.
At
times
during
high
school
when
I
was
mastering
the
art
of
procrastination,
I
would
go
digging
for
these
journals
rather
than
study
for
my
chemistry
exams.
I
have
spent
countless
hours
reading
over
the
entries
that
I
have
made
throughout
my
adolescent
years,
noticing
the
changes
in
my
emotional
state
and
my
writing
style
also.
Each
of
my
journals
has
a
different
pattern,
making
it
easier
to
tell
one
apart
from
the
other.
The
first
few
pages
of
each
journal
all
resemble
one
another,
written
neatly,
while
the
pages
to
follow,
consist
of
messy
print,
written
furiously
in
an
effort
to
record
each
emotion.
I
never
thought
that
I
would
appreciate
these
journals
as
much
as
I
do
now.
In
a
way
they
are
an
outlet
to
my
past,
helping
me
to
remember
what
it
was
like
to
be
young,
when
everything
was
so
fresh,
new,
exciting,
and
frightening
as
well.
They
are
the
encyclopedias
of
my
life
which
I
look
to
in
order
to
be
reminded
of
my
memorable
experiences
and
to
learn
from
my
mistakes.
I
consider
elementary
and
middle
school
years
as
a
type
of
preparation
for
the
amount
of
writing
I
was
required
to
produce
throughout
high
school.
Suddenly,
changes
in
my
writing
style
occurred
during
this
transition
when
I
was
asked
to
focus
less
on
creativity
and
a
great
deal
more
on
research
and
analysis.
Writing
became
more
difficult
for
me
because
I
was
no
longer
relying
simply
on
my
imagination.
It
was
in
my
tenth
grade
Honors
History
class
that
I
experienced
my
absolute
worst
experience
as
a
writer.
This
was
the
first
year
that
I
was
taking
an
advanced
History
course,
and
the
anxiety
I
felt
was
overwhelming.
Once
we
completed
a
unit,
my
teacher,
Mr.
Orfei,
gave
the
class
an
essay
exam,
emphasizing
that
all
the
material
from
the
unit
was
fair
game.
I
had
never
taken
a
History
exam
under
these
circumstances,
and
I
was
unsure
how
to
prepare
myself.
The
night
before
the
exam
I
spent
hours
reading
over
all
of
the
material,
hoping
to
remember
in
one
night
everything
I
had
learned
in
two
weeks.
Obviously
this
was
impossible,
as
I
learned
at
eight
o'clock
the
next
morning
when
the
essay
question
was
passed
out
and
all
I
could
write
was
my
name.
I
stared
at
the
exam,
hoping
that
I
would
miraculously
think
of
something
to
write
about,
without
much
luck.
While
my
classmates
were
writing
furiously
the
information
they
had
memorized
,
I
sat
motionless,
able
to
fill
only
half
a
page
with
words
that
weren't
even
comprehensible.
By
the
time
the
exam
was
over,
I
was
shaking
and
feeling
like
a
complete
failure.
I
received
a
D+
on
the
paper,
better
than
I
had
expected,
but
impressive
by
no
means.
I
questioned
whether
or
not
I
was
capable
of
taking
an
advanced
course
that
required
me
to
memorize
information
and
then
use
it
to
write
an
insightful
essay
integrating
historical
facts
with
only
forty
minutes
to
do
so.
I
feared
my
teacher
would
see
me
as
unintelligent
due
to
my
failed
first
attempt.
This
experience
was
definitely
my
worst,
but
in
a
way
I
am
grateful
that
it
happened.
I
met
with
Mr.
Orfei
shortly
after
I
received
my
grade,
and
he
uplifted
my
spirits
tremendously.
My
inability
to
perform
on
a
written
exam
was
discouraging,
but
he
convinced
me
to
continue
to
try
until
I
felt
comfortable
testing
under
such
constricting
circumstances.
Of
course
it
took
time
and
a
great
deal
of
dedication
on
my
part,
but
by
second
semester
I
was
receiving
B's
on
essays
I
thought
that
I
could
never
write.
Ironically,
my
best
experience
occurred
during
my
sophomore
jy
ear
as
well.
This
was
the
first
year
that
I
was
required
to
complete
a
research
paper
based
on
a
theme
from
a
novel
we
had
read
in
class.
Uneducated
on
how
to
write
a
paper
using
literary
critical
-sources,
[
panicked
as
I
have
a
tendency
to
do
that
I
wouldn't
be
able
to
do
it.
I
worried
that
I
wouldn't
know
how
to
analyze
and
integrate
outside
sources
into
my
paper.
I
worried
that
I
would
fail
at
writing.
In
this
case
my
paranoia
had
a
positive
effect
on
my
determination,
resulting
in
my
efforts
to
work
diligently
in
order
to
produce
a
fabulous
paper.
After
much
deliberation,
I
chose
to
write
about
Holden
Caulfield's
quest
to
preserve
innocence
in
The
Catcher
in
the
Rye.
I
left
myself
ample
time
to
prepare
by
reading
countless
sources
before
choosing
the
critiques
which
truly
matched
my
topic.
My
fingers
still
felt
numb
at
eleven
o'clock
the
Sunday
night
before
the
paper
was
due
as
I
flipped
through
the
ten
crisp,
white,
and
perfectly
typed
pages
of
a
paper
I
at
first
had
no
idea
how
to
write.
My
success
on
this
research
paper
was
illustrated
when
my
teacher
took
the
time
to
personally
tell
me
that
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
my
analysis.
I
had
received
a
ninety-five
out
of
a
hundred,
equivalent
to
an
A,
which
meant
he
would
be
using
my
paper
to
show
to
future
students
who
would
be
as
apprehensive
as
I
had
been
about
approaching
a
new
style
of
writing.
At
first
I
had
dreaded
having
to
write
a
research
paper
simply
because
I
never
had
before.
However,
just
the
fact
that
I
was
able
to
do
so
assured
me
that
I
couldn't
fear
expanding
my
capabilities
when
it
came
to
writing.
There
are
a
multitude
of
ways
that
a
person
can
express
his
or
her
beliefs
and
concerns,
even
through
papers
such
as
these.
I
chose
a
topic
that
intrigued
me,
and
as
a
result
I
combined
my
insight
with
the
ideas
of
others
to
produce
a
paper
that
I
am
proud
to
call
my
own
today.
Now
that
I
am
in
college,
I
feel
prepared
to
write
based
on
the
different
types
of
writing
to
which
I
was
introduced
in
high
school.
I
no
longer
fear
trying
new
styles
of
writing,
although
I've
realized
that
I
have
a
tendency
to
worry
whenever
I
am
completing
an
assignment,
which
is
natural.
My
teachers
in
high
school,
my
parents,
and
my
grandfather
were
very
influential
in
my
experiences
as
a
writer.
Initially,
I
was
nervous
to
be
evaluated
by
entirely
new
professors
when
I
first
came
to
Lafayette.
However,
after
completing
my
freshman
year
I
realized
that
I
still
have
a
great
deal
to
learn
and
I
can
only
improve
my
writing
by
continuing
to
devote
myself
to
my
passion.
My
new
position
as
a
Writing
Associate
appears
to
be
my
next
step
and
it
is
challenge
that
I
plan
to
face
with
an
undeniable
amount
of
enthusiasm.
I
look
forward
to
assisting
other
students
based
on
my
experiences
while
-becoming
a
more
competent
writer
myself.
Hopefully
I
can
become
an
in
influence
in
my
-own-way,
-providing-other
-students
with
the
same
confidence
and
guidance
that
led
me
to
develop
such
an
adoration
-for
writing.
