Writing
Experiences
By
the
end
of
first
grade
I
was
labeled
as
a
NStage
8O
writer.
A
NStage
8O
student
can
Nwrite
a
piece
with
a
beginning,
middle,
and
an
endO,
as
well
as
Ncorrectly
use
punctuation
and
capitalizationO.
However,
nothing
from
kindergarten
through
first
grade
remains
in
my
memory
bank.
Only
the
previously
referenced
report
cards
can
help
me
form
some
type
of
image
about
my
writing
abilities
in
first
grade.
My
first
memory
of
writing
includes
my
first
NpublishedO
book
in
second
grade.
Several
more
cheaply
assembled
glue-bound
books
were
to
follow
in
second,
third
and
fourth
grade.
My
second
grade
books
included
such
hits
as
my
five
sentence
book
on
Halloween
and
six
sentence
narrative
of
my
after-school
life.
While
my
narrative
books
and
other
written
pieces
were
not
of
Pulitzer
Prize
quality,
they
were
the
foundation
for
the
rest
of
my
academic
career.
I
took
on
multiple
genres
of
writing
in
middle
school.
My
language
arts
teachers
carefully
explained
the
ins
and
outs
of
persuasive
essays
and
comparison
essays.
I
soon
found
that
these
papers
were
effortless
compared
to
narratives.
I
was
able
to
use
the
basic
structure
presented
by
my
instructor
as
a
starting
point
for
my
work.
My
writing
was
also
significantly
improved
by
the
required
use
of
web
diagrams,
Venn
diagrams,
and
outlines.
The
pre-writing
techniques
and
newly
learned
genres
were
instrumental
in
my
high
school
success.
Middle
school
was
also
the
first
time
my
writing
was
no
longer
limited
to
pencil
and
paper.
The
new
family
computer
allowed
me
to
write
and
edit
papers
at
a
two-finger
pace.
This
writing
tool
became
more
efficient
after
I
took
a
typing
class
in
ninth
grade.
The
class
gave
me
the
ability
to
type
even
faster
than
I
could
think
of
what
to
write.
Almost
all
of
my
writing
occurs
on
the
computer.
The
only
exception
is
standardized
testing
and
short
answer
questions
on
tests.
While
only
one
class
a
year
was
titled
NEnglishO
in
high
school,
every
class
but
math
featured
writing
as
the
testing
standard.
I
was
no
longer
being
tested
through
fill
in
the
blank
or
true-false
questions.
Science
classes
required
weekly
lab
reports
and
government
classes
heavily
favored
persuasive
essays.
Even
gym
classes
required
a
yearly
three
page
paper
on
exercise.
However,
many
of
the
papers
were
simple
three
or
five
paragraph
pieces.
I
reached
a
pivotal
point
in
the
development
of
my
writing
during
eleventh
grade.
Eleventh
grade
English
at
my
high
school
required
an
eight
page
research
paper
with
at
least
three
primary
and
three
secondary
sources.
A
week
of
researching
and
a
second
week
of
writing
led
to
a
pinnacle
piece
of
work
on
the
reflection
of
Arthur
MillerOs
life
experiences
in
his
popular
novels.
Never
before
had
I
received
so
much
enjoyment
from
writing.
I
took
pleasure
in
writing
a
paper
on
something
that
I
researched
rather
than
created
out
of
thin
air.
I
had
done
shorter
research
papers
before,
but
I
had
never
been
able
to
freely
choose
a
topic.
This
paper
helped
me
realize
how
important
it
is
to
write
about
topics
that
interest
you.
Brainstorming
possible
paper
topics
has
become
a
very
time
consuming
part
of
my
writing
process
since
that
project.
The
high
school
that
I
graduated
from
had
a
reputation
for
less
than
superior
English
teachers.
It
was
well
known
that
the
high
school
I
attended
excelled
in
the
areas
of
mathematics
and
science.
However,
I
still
felt
like
I
was
an
above
average
writer
heading
into
college.
Throughout
high
school
I
had
my
Mom
read
over
my
essays
and
we
would
critique
them
together.
It
was
very
common
to
hear
my
mom
comment
that
my
writing
was
much
better
than
my
two
older
brothersO
writing.
That
greatly
improved
my
writing
confidence
because
my
oldest
brother
had
already
graduated
college
and
my
other
brother
was
heading
into
his
senior
year
at
Gettysburg
College
while
positioned
at
the
top
of
his
class.
On
the
other
hand,
I
also
knew
that
I
had
unlimited
room
for
my
writing
to
improve.
I
expected
my
writing
to
gradually
improve
throughout
my
years
at
Lafayette.
Unfortunately,
I
had
barely
improved
my
writing
after
my
first
year.
It
wasnOt
until
my
second
year
in
NEnglish
110O
that
I
made
a
huge
leap
in
my
writing
abilities.
I
attribute
most
of
my
improvement
to
the
book
Revising
Prose
and
a
few
well
timed
conference
questions
by
my
professor.
Writing
very
passive
and
convoluted
sentences
had
plagued
much
of
my
writing.
The
first
chapter
of
Revising
Prose
laid
out
the
NParamedic
MethodO.
It
allowed
me
to
easily
put
my
writing
in
a
more
active
voice.
I
spent
the
semester
improving
my
writing
style
using
this
method.
That
semesterOs
writing
became
even
easier
after
learning
a
new
technique
called
free-writing.
It
helped
me
overcome
the
initial
NwriterOs
blockO
that
I
typically
encountered
as
I
started
a
paper.
It
helped
me
layout
my
initial
thoughts
about
the
topic.
My
free-writing
consists
of
a
five
minute
period
where
I
continuously
type
my
initial
feelings
about
the
topic.
The
introduction,
middle,
and
conclusion
of
the
paper
are
then
derived
from
the
free-writing
thoughts.
I
no
longer
sat
and
stared
at
the
computer,
waiting
for
an
introduction
to
come
to
me.
My
second
year
improvement
in
English
110
led
to
my
most
exceptional
piece
of
writing.
The
paper
was
based
on
the
writing
format
in
Working
by
the
late
Studs
Terkel.
The
essay
described
the
daily
work
my
brother
performs
at
his
financial
analyst
position
inside
a
large
investment
management
company.
Following
the
method
from
eleventh
grade,
I
spent
hours
contemplating
multiple
topics.
I
spent
a
few
hours
extracting
possible
paper
topics
from
my
family
members
before
settling
on
the
previously
mentioned
topic.
My
primary
source
was
a
two
hour
interview
with
my
brother.
I
spent
five
minutes
free-writing
directly
after
the
interview.
The
free-writing
ideas
then
turned
into
the
rough
outline
of
my
paper.
The
actual
writing
became
the
easiest
part
of
the
whole
process.
The
toughest
part
was
the
three
revisions
using
the
NParamedic
MethodO
from
Revising
Prose.
I
spent
many
hours
reworking
sentences
and
cutting
out
the
lard.
My
final
paper
was
received
very
well
by
my
peers
and
professor.
The
paper
was
voted
as
the
best
overall
paper
in
the
class.
It
was
the
first
time
that
one
of
my
writings
had
ever
been
acknowledged
as
a
well
written
paper
by
my
peers.
It
felt
refreshing
to
know
that
I
could
write
a
paper
that
my
peers
found
interesting
and
unique.
The
next
paper
I
wrote
took
a
completely
different
route.
I
used
exactly
the
same
methods
in
the
new
paper
as
my
previously
well
received
essay.
However,
my
piece
of
writing
never
reached
its
full
potential.
My
own
personal
revisions
did
not
improve
the
paper.
It
took
a
conference
with
my
professor
to
realize
the
problem
with
my
paper.
I
had
to
step
back
during
the
conference
and
look
at
the
paper
as
a
reader.
The
conference
made
me
realize
that
I
failed
to
fully
explain
the
ideas
in
my
paper.
I,
as
the
writer,
knew
the
thoughts
the
behind
the
paper,
but
I
left
the
reader
confused.
It
was
the
first
time
I
completely
rewrote
an
essay
because
of
a
conference.
It
was
also
memorable
because
it
was
a
conference
where
I
did
all
of
the
talking,
similar
to
NThe
Listening
Eye.O
My
academic
writing
in
college
consists
mostly
of
lab
reports
because
I
am
a
civil
engineering
major.
However,
a
college
level
lab
report
is
only
slightly
different
than
a
typical
research
paper.
Most
notably,
a
typical
lab
report
will
differ
in
the
format.
Lab
reports
must
all
contain,
in
order:
a
letter
of
transmittal,
title
page,
table
of
contents,
introduction,
procedure,
results,
discussion,
conclusions,
recommendations,
list
of
references,
and
appendixes.
However,
a
successful
lab
report
will
feature
short
NactiveO
sentences
that
coincide
with
the
Paramedic
Method.
As
discussed
in
NInventing
the
UniversityO,
a
lab
report
is
an
example
of
a
type
of
writing
that
forces
a
student
to
learn
a
whole
new
writing
language
or
at
least
Ncarry
off
the
bluffO.
Lab
report
sentences
must
be
short
and
concise,
while
remaining
extremely
detailed.
Students
must
learn
new
terms
and
use
specific
civil
engineering
lingo.
For
example,
soil
must
never
be
called
dirt.
The
lab
report
must
be
written
for
the
reader
and
that
requires
the
report
to
be
written
in
the
language
of
a
professional
civil
engineer.
The
consistent
writing
of
lab
reports
often
throws
off
my
typical
writing
style.
Therefore,
some
of
my
recent
narrative
writing
has
not
been
at
the
level
I
strive
for,
which
leads
me
to
be
my
toughest
critic.
For
example,
I
look
at
this
piece
of
writing
and
wonder
if
I
have
gone
into
enough
detail
about
my
early
writing
memories.
Unfortunately,
pre-school
through
eight
grade
are
years
that
remain
hazy
at
best.
Even
if
I
could
remember
something
about
my
early
writing,
it
would
most
likely
be
exaggerated
or
possibly
even
fabricated.
That
leads
me
to
believe
that
I
may
have
taken
a
very
linear
path
in
my
writing.
I
may
not
have
many
memorable
writing
experiences
because
I
have
gradually
picked
up
on
writing
techniques
and
conventions.
Similarly
to
how
my
vocabulary
has
steadily
grown
over
the
years
from
reading
books,
playing
games,
solving
word
puzzles,
etc.
My
vocabulary
has
been
a
direct
result
of
twenty
years
of
learning.
The
same
can
be
said
of
my
writing
abilities
and
the
writing
abilities
of
my
peers.
We
all
share
a
similar
challenge
to
gradually
develop
and
improve
our
writing.
Therefore,
every
new
writing
assignment
is
another
opportunity
to
improve
and
progress.
