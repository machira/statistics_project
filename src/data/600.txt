Reading,
Writing,
and
Talking
as
a
WA
In
my
two
previous
literacy
narratives,
I
have
reflected
mostly
on
the
relationship
between
my
skills
as
a
reader
and
my
endeavors
as
a
writer.
This
year,
however,
my
work
with
not
two
but
three
classes
of
student
writers
has
drawn
my
attention
not
only
to
my
previous
topic
of
communication
between
reading
and
writing,
but
also
to
communication
between
people.
I
have
noticed
over
the
past
year
that
the
College
Writing
Programus
heightened
focus
on
writing
conference
social
dynamics
has
made
me
more
alert
to
how
I
interact
with
student
writers.
But
whatus
more,
it
has
affected
how
I
communicate
with
myself,
when
I
find
myself
facing
the
kinds
of
tough
problems
that
I
see
other
student
writers
tackle
in
conference
sessions.
The
resulting
heightened
ability
to
work
through
writing
issues
from
both
a
WAus
and
a
writerus
perspective
simultaneously,
has
been,
to
my
opinion,
the
greatest
improvement
in
my
personal
writing
process
over
the
past
year.
My
second
year
reading
and
writing
as
a
WA
formally
began
at
last
Augustus
training
session.
From
that
first
meeting
it
was
clear
that
the
CWP
was
changing.
At
the
training
seminar,
I
remember
being
introduced
not
only
to
new
staff
members
and
a
new
coordinator,
but
also
the
fresh
focus
on
the
social
politics
of
working
with
other
student
writers.
At
one
point
in
the
afternoon
meeting,
the
staff
broke
into
small
groups,
with
one
or
two
veteran
WAs
and
one
or
two
new
WAs.
Veteran
WAs,
like
me,
were
asked
to
field
questions
from
the
new
WAs,
or
share
any
on-the-job
experiences
we
thought
were
relevant.
I
remember
that
a
program
administrator
came
over
and
sat
in
our
group
just
as
my
fellow
veteran
WA
talked
about
how
she
liked
to
make
notes
while
reading
papers,
so
that
student
writers
would
be
able
to
look
at
them
while
performing
revision.
It
was
a
strategy
that
I
myself
had
employed
from
time
to
time,
but
that
I
ultimately
abandoned
because
I
found
that
it
often
distracted
student
writers
during
our
conferences.
The
administrator
sitting
with
us,
however,
urged
us
to
consider
another
reason
why
writing
on
a
student
writerus
paper
may
not
be
a
preferred
strategy.
The
professor
asked
us
what
kind
of
a
relationship
handing
back
a
marked
paper
connotes.
Everyone
in
our
group
agreed
the
practice
reminded
us
of
receiving
high
school
essays
back
from
a
teacher.
However,
as
our
staff
came
to
discuss
in
many
meetings
over
the
last
school
year,
the
relationship
between
WA
and
student
writer
is
not
meant
to
mirror
the
teacher-student
relationship,
in
which
the
teacher
possesses
power
and
knowledge
which
the
student
must
try
to
access
through
the
instructor.
Instead,
we
try
to
foster
a
dynamic
in
which
the
student
writer
is
the
highest
authority
on
any
given
piece
of
writing,
and
the
WA
the
Socratic
examiner
who
tries
to
engage
them
in
dialogue,
to
start
them
communicating.
The
revelation
I
had
in
that
staff
meeting,
though
it
may
seem
to
pertain
to
a
specific
practice
that
I
myself
had
barely
used,
actually
had
profound
implications.
Although
it
only
directly
changed
one
of
my
own
personal
writing
tasksiawhat
kind
of
writing
I
do
on
student
writersu
draftsiait
began
a
dialogue
in
my
own
mind,
about
what
sort
of
power
structures
are
encoded
in
the
details
of
social
exchanges.
I
started
thinking
about
not
only
my
interactions
with
my
partner
classes
in
greater
detail,
but
also
my
interactions
with
the
world
at
largeiaincluding
the
ideas
housed
in
my
own
head.
However,
it
took
working
with
actual
student
writers
to
make
me
see
how
much
my
approach
had
broadened
My
first
partner
class
of
the
year
was
a
First
Year
Seminar
run
by
a
geology
professor.
I
was
especially
excited
to
work
with
the
class,
partially
because,
as
a
double
major
in
geology,
I
was
thrilled
to
work
in
one
of
my
own
home
departments.
As
I
discussed
in
writing
my
two
previous
literacy
narratives
for
the
CWP,
learning
to
write
effectively
in
the
sciences
has
been
a
challenge
for
me,
because
it
has
taken
me
longer
to
develop
as
an
experienced
reader
of
scientific
writing.
Taking
my
first
writing-based
geology
courses
and
becoming
more
familiar
with
published
earth
science
literature
have
helped
me
to
better
understand
what
strong
scientific
writing
must
sound
like,
but
I
hoped
that
reading
student
papers
and
seeing
their
development
over
the
course
of
a
semester
would
help
refine
my
ability
to
recognize
how
scientific
writing
communicates
effectively.
When
I
sat
down
to
talk
with
my
partner
professor
the
week
before
class
began,
I
became
more
confident
that
working
with
the
student
writers
would
be
beneficial
to
my
own
development,
specifically
regarding
scientific
writing.
The
professor
explained
to
me
in
our
meeting
that
the
majority
of
papers
I
would
conference
with
the
student
writers
on
would
be
responses
to
scientific
texts.
His
assignments
would
ask
student
writers
to
simultaneously
explain
the
theory
they
read
about
and
apply
the
science
to
day-to-day
happenings
in
their
own
lives.
Throughout
the
semester,
reading
the
writing
each
class
member
brought
to
conferences
did
increase
my
familiarity
with
scientific
writing.
The
fact
that
the
students
had
to
apply
science
to
seemingly
non-scientific
topicsialike
what
they
order
for
lunch
each
day,
or
how
they
interact
with
their
siblingsiaemboldened
me
to
take
greater
jumps
in
my
own
science
writing.
Because
I
was
reading
so
many
analogies
and
metaphors
from
the
FYS
class,
I
felt
I
was
developing
a
stronger
ear
for
how
deeply
figurate
language
could
extend
before
the
science
seemed
to
get
lost.
The
improved
critical
capacities
proved
especially
useful
in
writing
the
numerous
lab
reports
my
semester
required;
I
found
explanatory
portions
becoming
denser
and
more
colorful,
as
I
gave
freer
reign
to
the
more
creative
writing
habits
I
have
developed
as
an
English
major.
While
I
felt
indebted
to
the
FYS
professorus
demanding
assignments,
the
student
writers
I
met
with
were
less
enthused
about
weaving
together
scientific
discourseiawhich
they
were
not
entirely
comfortable
withiaand
personal
reflectioniawhich
they
were
not
entirely
comfortable
with.
It
was
when
student
writers
came
to
conferences
frustrated,
skeptical,
and
confused
that
I
felt
I
learned
the
most
about
the
interpersonal
dynamics
discussed
in
WA
staff
meetings.
I
remember
in
our
final
two
rounds
of
conferences,
the
student
writers
were
working
on
their
final
papersiaa
10-page
essay
applying
theories
of
evolution
to
a
research
topic
that
was
personally
important
to
them.
One
student
writer
stands
out
in
particulariaa
prospective
art
major
who
desperately
wanted
to
right
about
changing
American
architecture
for
the
paper.
When
she
came
into
Pardee
319
on
the
evening
of
our
conference,
she
had
no
draft
with
her,
only
an
email
file
with
pictures
of
the
architecture
styles
she
wanted
to
write
about.
Drawing
on
the
mock
conferences
my
fellow
WAs
and
I
had
been
running
in
our
weekly
staff
meetings,
I
began
to
engage
her
in
a
discussion
of
the
pictures,
and
why
she
wanted
to
write
about
them.
As
she
pointed
out
the
various
elements
of
each
design,
and
the
way
one
style
gave
way
to
another,
I
began
to
come
up
with
some
of
my
own
ideas
of
how
she
could
apply
evolutionary
theory
to
her
topic.
Part
of
me
desperately
wanted
to
tell
her
my
ideasiaprobably
the
same
part
of
me
that
walks
out
of
movies
explaining
how
the
writers
should
have
written
the
endingiabut
our
discussions
of
the
student
writer-WA
relationship
gave
me
pause.
While
giving
the
student
writer
a
topic
I
cooked
up
might
have
saved
her
some
time
and
energy,
it
felt
wrong,
and
not
just
because
it
was
a
dubious
violation
of
academic
honesty.
I
have
come
to
believe
that
telling
a
student
writer
what
to
writeia
essentially
assigning
her
a
topiciais
actually
an
abuse
of
power,
akin
to
pushing
the
student
writer
out
of
the
conferenceus
proverbial
driver
seat.
Instead
of
offering
quick
fixes
to
the
art
major,
I
employed
the
Socratic
Method,
asking
her
as
many
questions
as
I
could
think
of
about
her
proposed
topic,
the
theories
she
had
studied
in
class,
any
connections
she
could
find
between
them.
Our
conference
eked
past
the
30
minutes
we
had
originally
scheduled,
but
she
walked
with
a
topic
idea
of
her
own
designing.
I
felt
good
about
it
at
the
time,
but
I
admit
that
I
felt
even
better
about
it
two
weeks
later,
when
I
sat
in
front
of
my
own
laptop,
as
frustrated
and
dejected
as
any
of
the
student
writers
who
came
into
our
last
round
of
conferences.
I
was
struggling
with
a
final
paper
for
one
of
my
English
classes,
in
which
I
had
to
perform
a
close
reading
of
an
early
American
document
of
my
choosing.
Usually,
I
relish
the
freedom
of
Englishus
open-ended
topics,
and
I
was
honestlyiaand
a
little
cornilyiaexcited
about
my
chosen
focus(es)
for
this
assignment:
anti-feminism,
the
womenus
education
debate,
and
Godeyus
Ladyus
Book,
a
once-popular
magazine.
However,
as
I
finished
poring
through
texts
and
sat
down
to
begin
drafting,
I
realized
that
for
all
my
engaging
ideas,
I
didnut
have
a
coherent
theme
to
explore.
Like
the
student
writer
who
came
to
a
conference
with
only
photo
files,
I
was
holding
disconnected
pieces,
without
anyone
who
could
tell
me
how
to
fit
them
together.
Again,
it
was
Socratic
Method
that
saved
me.
This
time,
though,
I
was
the
one
asking
and
answering
the
questions.
I
thought
of
the
way
Rachel-the-WA
would
deal
with
Rachel-the-student-writer,
the
kind
of
questions
I
would
ask.
Then,
I
asked
myself
the
questions.
I
sat
and
wrote
down
what
in
particular
I
liked
about
the
topic,
what
the
underlying
themes
in
each
element
of
the
essay
were,
whether
any
of
those
themes
related,
what
those
relations
were.
Sometimes,
I
even
talked
them
outiain
the
privacy
of
my
own
dorm
room,
of
course.
Within
a
few
nights,
I
built
a
topic
that
I
was
comfortable
writing
about.
Ium
still
not
sure
what
I
would
have
done
without
practice
interviewing
other
writers.
I
like
to
think
I
would
have
still
built
a
rewarding
thesis,
but
I
can
only
imagine
how
many
days
of
fruitless
staring
at
my
notebook
it
would
have
taken
to
get
there.
I
ran
into
the
importance
of
asking
the
right
questions
again
second
semesteriaboth
working
with
student
writers
and
writing
my
own
essays.
Second
semester
was
one
of
the
most
truly
unique
Iuve
experienced
as
a
WA,
because
I
found
myself
working
with
not
one
but
two
partner
classes.
My
multi-tasking
and
scheduling
skills
got
a
workout
the
likes
of
which
they
had
never
seen
before,
andiaas
someone
with
a
writing
process
that
typically
includes
two
types
of
preliminary
outline
and
upwards
of
four
major-overhaul
rewritesiaI
am
sure
that
clerical
aspects
of
my
own
writing
were
improved
by
having
to
coordinate
schedules
with
two
different
partner
professors
and
completely
switch
gears
from
one
conference
to
the
next.
However,
it
was
again
my
skills
of
inquiry
which
I
feel
were
most
sharpened
by
at
least
one
of
my
two
partner
classes.
For
the
final
paper
of
the
VAST
class
I
worked
with,
student
writers
had
to
incorporate
different
types
of
source
material
they
had
experienced
in
the
classiafrom
literature,
to
film,
to
scientific
papers,
to
magazine
articles,
to
YouTube
videosiainto
one
long
essay.
I
again
found
myself
throwing
critical
questions
at
student
writers
for
20
minutes
at
a
time.
This
time,
however,
the
writers
called
for
my
assistance
not
only
in
figuring
out
what
they
wanted
to
say,
but
in
figuring
out
what
their
professor
wanted
them
to
say.
Again
and
again,
the
same
dialogue
played
out:
rHow
many
sources
should
I
use?s
Well,
how
many
did
your
professor
ask
for?
rHe
said
tas
many
as
we
thought
we
needed.us
Okay.
So,
how
many
do
you
think
you
need?
rI
donut
know.
Thatus
why
Ium
asking
you!s
A
total
conversation
standstill
threatened,
but
I
dealt
with
the
student
writersu
frustration
the
best
way
I
knew
howiaby
asking
more
questions.
I
urged
them
to
consider
what
criteria
they
felt
was
important
in
determining
how
many
sources
would
be
useful,
and
I
offered
some
of
my
own
thoughts
and
ideas,
without
giving
them
any
arbitrary
magic
number.
Not
only
did
the
tactic
avoid
potentially
ugly
debates
of
rBut
the
WA
said
I
only
needed
six
sources!,s
it
ultimately
helped
me
refine
my
criteria
for
determining
what
is
needed
or
not
needed
in
a
given
essay.
The
knowledge
proved
especially
useful
when
writing
a
final
essay
that
semester,
which
required
me
to
compile
and
analyze
constructions
of
a
particular
word
in
different
social
contexts.
My
professor
enigmatically
told
the
class
that
she
would
not
give
a
number
of
sources
that
we
needed,
only
that
the
paper
should
tfeel
complete.u
In
the
past,
my
way
of
handling
such
uncertainty
was
often
to
include
as
many
sources
as
humanly
possible,
resorting
to
size-10
fonts
and
.2-inch
margins,
if
needed.
This
time,
however,
I
was
able
to
ask
myself
the
same
questions
I
had
asked
other
student
writers
in
conferences,
and
forced
myself
to
make
a
confidentiaand
competentiaevaluation
of
what
tfeeling
completeu
actually
meant
to
me.
Of
course,
that
partner
class
was
not
the
only
to
help
advance
my
own
writing
that
semester.
In
fact,
the
other
class
I
worked
with
that
semester
provided
one
of
the
most
jarring
experiences
for
personal
reflection
Iuve
ever
had.
The
reason
is
that
I
WA-ed
for
a
class
I
had
taken
the
year
previousiaan
upper-level
geology
course.
The
main
project
of
the
class
was
to
research
and
put
together
a
report
on
two
local
drainage
basins,
over
the
course
of
the
full
semester.
All
four
rounds
of
conferences
were
on
that
paper,
a
paper
I
myself
had
turned
in
less
than
a
year
before.
Listening
to
the
questions
the
student
writers
asked
me,
and
asking
questions
of
them
in
turn,
I
was
forced
to
think
about
the
questions
I
had
askediaand
not
askediawhen
I
was
the
student
writer
on
this
paper.
More
often
than
I
was
comfortable
with,
I
heard
the
writers
ask
questions
that
had
confused
me,
but
that
I
had
never
presented
to
anyone
else.
I
saw
how
much
progress
the
student
writers
made
with
their
uncertainties
when
we
talked
them
out
together,
and
I
realized
thatiaeven
though
I
myself
am
a
paid
collaboratoriamy
personal
writing
is
more
lacking
in
collaboration
than
I
realized.
One
of
my
resolutions
for
this
coming
school
year
is
to
make
sure
I
discuss
aspects
of
my
papers
with
other
peopleiabe
it
my
professors,
other
WAs,
classmates,
or
friends.
I
know
that
the
effort
will
be
profitable,
because
thanks
to
my
experiences
this
year,
I
know
the
benefit
to
be
had
from
sitting
down
to
talk
and
really
listeningia
even
if
I
am
only
listening
to
myself.
