Retracing
my
steps
August
1997
I
have
never
really
considered
myself
a
writer.
Even
though
writing
has
come
somewhat
easy
to
me
throughout
high
school
and
college,
I
do
not
deem
myself
worthy
of
writer's
status.
I
reserve
this
title
for
the
elite
who
are
able
to
channel
direct
emotions
through
their
pen.
I
imagine
a
writer
to
be
like
an
Olympic
runner,
who
has
trained
very
hard
but
also
has
been
bom
with
a
propensity,
and
I
am
merely
a
high
school
track
team
member.
In
spite
of
my
quibbling
over
definitions,
I
suppose
I
cannot
escape
the
discussion
at
hand
of
describing
my
history
of
writing.
Although
I
may
not
be
a
writer,
writing
holds
a
substantial
place
in
my
life
as
a
student
and
as
an
individual
communicating
with
others.
I
still
grumble
about
having
to
write
papers
and
I
always
have
a
thesaurus
handy,
but
writing
is
the
means
through
which
I
feel
most
comfortable
expressing
myself.
I
love
the
versatility
of
writing
and
how
I
can
adapt
it
to
meet
my
needs.
For
instance,
I
can
change
words
and
move
sentences
to
obtain
maximum
power
from
an
assigned
argumentative
essay;
or
when
I
am
upset
I
can
pick
up
my
journal
and
write
in
a
stream
of
consciousness
style,
not
caring
about
comma
placement
or
sentence
order.
And
come
to
think
of
it,
I
guess
from
the
beginning
writing
has
always
felt
comfortable
to
me.
For
me,
'the
beginning'
would
be
first
grade.
I
remember
every
Monday
Mrs.
Raska
would
have
each
of
the
students
in
the
class
draw
a
picture
of
something
we
did
over
the
weekend
and
then
explain
it
with
a
caption.
In
the
beginning
of
the
year,
I
had
not
yet
learned
to
print
or
read
so
I
would
narrate
the
caption
and
Mrs.
Raska
would
print
it
for
me.
By
the
end
of
first
grade,
though,
I
had
been
taught
the
fundamentals
of
reading
and
writing
and
would
struggle
through
my
own
picture
caption--with
help
of
course
on
the
spelling.
Whereas
before
I
could
write
on
my
own
I
would
work
very
hard
on
my
drawing,
once
I
had
the
capabilities
to
do
the
caption
by
myself
I
would
rush
through
the
picture
and
concentrate
on
those
two
or
three
rudimentary
sentences.
Being
able
to
explain
myself
through
those
words
meant
a
lot
to
me
as
a
first
grader
and
I
am
afraid
my
artistic
ability
may
have
suffered
ever
since.
My
only
memories
from
second
and
third
grade
that
have
anything
remotely
to
do
with
writing
involve
learning
cursive
and
that
dreaded
subject--Phoenix.
In
fourth
grade,
however,
I
do
have
a
very
clear
and
very
significant
memory
about
my
writing.
For
Saint
Patrick's
Day,
my
teacher,
Mrs.
Hartman,
had
each
of
her
students
compose
a
short
story
about
a
leprechaun.
I
do
not
remember
what
exactly
I
wrote
about,
but
I
know
I
described
an
enchanted
forest
of
green
candy
flowers,
chocolate
tree
trunks,
and
soft
blankets
of
moss
into
which
the
leprechaun
ventured.
I
still
have
the
story
stashed
away
with
old
report
cards
and
probably
some
of
those
captioned
pictures
from
first
grade.
I
know
I
have
read
it
in
the
past
five
years
and
thought
it
was
nothing
too
special,
but
the
significance
of
the
green
dwarf
story
is
how
impressed
Mrs.
Hartman
had
been
and
that
she
had
even
showed
it
to
my
elementary
school
principal.
This
is
the
first
time
that
I
can
recall
anyone
else's
reaction
to
my
writing.
I
remember
being
very
flattered
by
my
teacher's
praise.
I
had
worked
very
hard
on
my
Saint
Patty's
Day
tale
and
almost
embarrassingly
agreed
with
my
teacher
that
it
was
a
pretty
good
story.
This
led
me
to
realize
that
writing
was
something
at
which
I
could
excel
if
I
put
my
mind
to
it.
The
remainder
of
my
elementary
and
middle
school
memories
involving
writing
have
to
do
mainly
with
book
reports
that
always
yielded
a
good
grade
but
were
a
major
production
to
be
written.
I
remember
in
sixth
grade
I
had
to
read
one
of
Mark
Twain's
books
and
A
Wrinkle
in
Time
and
fill
out
worksheets
about
each
chapter.
To
this
day
I
still
resent
having
to
do
those
book
studies,
but
in
spite
of
their
tediousness
they
taught
me
how
to
process
and
not
just
absorb
someone
else's
writing.
In
turn,
I
believe
this
triggered
me
to
write
with
more
depth--something
that
became
essential
once
I
reached
high
school
and
honors
English.
The
first
time
that
I
can
remember
my
writing
being
challenged
was
in
ninth
grade
when
I
started
in
the
honors
high
school
English
course.
After
two
years
of
repetitive
grammar,
my
rather
eccentric
teacher,
Ms.
Gabriel,
made
up
for
all
the
lost
time
that
my
class
had
not
been
writing.
She
assigned
a
five
minute
daily
writing
session
that
she
checked
at
the
end
of
each
quarter.
I
still
remember
sitting
in
my
kitchen
two
days
before
the
end
of
the
quarter
writing
about
four
weeks
worth
of
journal
entries
in
one
night.
The
journals
were
not
allowed
to
be
records
of
our
day,
but
rather
free
writing
focused
on
some
abstraction.
Although
I
know
this
experience
helped
to
improve
my
writing
ability,
I
still
associate
a
forced
element
with
creative
writing.
In
tenth
grade
I
studied
poetry
in
depth
and
become
comfortable
discussing
and
evaluating
a
genre
which
had
previously
been
unfamiliar
to
me.
I
remember
sharing
with
my
parents
a
critical
writing
piece
I
had
done
on
Robert
Frost
and
looking
very
much
for
their
approval.
Although
I
do
not
consider
my
father
a
writer,
I
have
always
been
aware
of
his
ability
to
write
and
felt
honored
to
see
his
reassuring
nod
as
he
read
my
essay.
My
high
school
junior
year
extended
writing
outside
of
English
class.
My
Physics
teacher,
Mr.
Weiss,
assigned
article
reviews
about
every
other
week
and
laboratory
discussions
once
a
week.
The
articles
were
normally
very
extensive
and
very
detailed
and
the
assignment
was
to
summarize
the
idea
discussed.
I
found
that
although
I
often
was
unable
to
really
comprehend
the
complicated
mechanics
or
quantum
physics
being
discussed
in
the
article,
I
was
still
able
to
write
an
accurate
review.
Ironically
I
got
more
the
point
of
the
article
by
going
back
and
reading
my
summary
than
I
did
from
reading
the
article
myself.
Whereas
the
article
reviews
helped
me
to
clarify
my
writing,
the
lab
reports
helped
me
to
make
my
writing
concise.
Mr.
Weiss
was
very
picky
about
our
discussion
section
of
the
lab
and
limited
the
space
with
which
we
had
to
prove
our
comprehension
of
the
experiment.
In
the
past
I
had
been
able
to
dance
around
my
scientific
writing
and
felt
confident
that
somewhere
in
my
pages
of
ramblings
I
had
met
my
teacher's
requirements.
But
the
physics
labs
forced
me
to
write
very
exactly
and
very
simply--a
style
I
still
favor
when
length
is
not
a
factor.
In
addition
to
the
article
reviews
and
laboratory
reports,
Mr.
Weiss
assigned
a
large
group
project
at
the
end
of
the
year.
Part
of
the
project
was
to
research
several
topics
and
then
discuss
each
of
them
in
one
large
paper.
With
five
people
in
my
group
and
only
four
topics
to
research,
I
volunteered
to
put
the
paper
together
and
write
an
introduction
and
a
conclusion.
The
day
before
our
paper
was
due,
my
fellow
group
members
gave
me
their
written
sections
to
assemble
into
our
finished
product.
With
the
help
of
general
physics
knowledge,
some
transitionals,
and
a
little
editing,
the
group
paper
came
together
rather
smoothly.
My
friends
read
it
before
we
handed
it
in
and
were
really
impressed
with
the
fine
tuning
and
how
everything
had
fit
together.
This
was
very
significant
to
me
because
it
was
the
first
time
my
peers
read
something
which
I
had
written.
During
my
senior
year
in
high
school,
I
took
an
AP
English
class
and
had
to
write
what
I
consider
my
first
real
research
paper--'real'
meaning
that
it
required
me
to
go
beyond
my
high
school's
limited
library.
I
researched
Edward
Albee
and
how
his
life
affected
his
play
Who's
Afraid
of
Virginia
Woolf
I
remember
enjoying
the
play
and
finding
it
easy
to
discuss,
but
having
trouble
making
an
argument
concerning
how
Albee's
life
impacted
the
work.
I
handed
in
the
paper
almost
satisfied
with
it,
but
was
upset
when
it
was
returned.
Now
that
I
think
of
it,
I
was
not
so
much
disappointed
with
the
grade
as
I
was
disappointed
with
myself.
Although
my
processing
of
the
play
had
been
more
than
adequate,
without
an
argumentative
or
informative
edge
the
supposed
research
paper
came
out
more
as
a
book
report.
The
experience
was
a
good
reminder
for
me
that
writing
is
a
process
at
which
I
must
continually
make
an
effort.
A
more
enjoyable
writing
experience
which
I
had
in
my
AP
class
involved
a
creative
writing
assignment.
After
studying
Kafka's
Metamorphoses,
my
English
teacher
assigned
a
fictional
short
story
about
some
physical
change
which
we
experienced.
I
wrote
about
how
I
felt
like
I
was
being
pulled
through
the
motions
of
my
life
and
therefore
was
transformed
into
a
marionette.
I
was
very
happy
with
the
piece
and
even
proud
enough
of
it
to
show
it
to
my
parents,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
my
mother
was
often
the
one
controlling
my
strings
in
the
story.
Overall
I
felt
adequately
prepared
for
college
in
terms
of
my
writing
ability,
but
feared
falling
below
the
average
level
of
freshman
competency.
I
remember
how
nervous
I
was
handing
in
my
first
collegiate
writing
assignment.
Although
my
first
year
seminar
was
only
moderately
challenging
as
far
as
written
expectations,
I
did
put
a
lot
of
time
into
my
weekly
journal
entries
and
three
required
papers.
Written
assignments
were
not
read
aloud
during
class
and
peer
editing
was
not
employed,
so
I
was
unaware
of
how
my
writing
compared
to
my
classmates'.
I
was
very
surprised,
and
even
a
little
honored,
when
my
professor
approached
me
about
possible
exemption
from
freshman
composition.
Second
semester
of
my
freshman
year
I
was
mercifully
exempt
from
English
110
and
resultantly
enrolled
in
Literary
Questions,
English
205.
If
my
success
in
the
first
year
seminar
boosted
my
writing
ego
at
all,
this
class
knocked
me
back
down
to
size.
The
purpose
of
the
class
was
to
examine
what
makes
literature
literature
and
the
dynamics
of
the
reader-writer
relationship
by
looking
at
Emily
Dickinson's
poems,
the
novel
Snow
Falling
on
Cedars,
the
comic
book
Maus,
the
screenplay
Pulp
Fiction,
and
Dante's
Inferno.
Assignments
included
a
weekly
journal
on
whichever
piece
we
were
currently
studying
and
three
assigned
papers
on,
what
seemed
to
me,
these
very
foreign
and
awkward
literary
genres.
I
was
intimidated
by
not
only
the
readings
and
written
requirements,
but
also
the
class
itself.
This
was
my
first
encounter
with
upperclassmen
in
a
small
class
setting.
My
intimidation
prevented
me
from
speaking
up
in
class,
so
I
had
to
make
twice
the
effort
for
my
voice
to
be
heard
through
my
writing.
I
eventually
got
the
hang
of
my
professor's
preferred
high
informal
style,
but
I
struggled
up
until
the
end
with
my
theses.
A
'thesis'
which
I
felt
comfortable
proving
lacked
argument
and
was
mere
observation,
but
a
thesis
which
merited
discussion
went
beyond
my
realm
of
understanding.
Through
my
professor's
comments
at
the
end
of
my
papers
and
a
couple
of
revisions,
I
eventually
earned
a
grade
with
which
I
am
happy
and,
more
importantly,
produced
some
pages
worth
reading.
It
is
funny
to
think
that
the
complex
writing
I
did
in
English
205
on
Dante's
Inferno
can
be
traced
back
to
first
grade
when
I
wrote
simple
sentences
about
my
weekend.
I
cannot
help
but
see
each
of
the
writings
previously
discussed
as
one
step
on
an
endless
ladder.
Some
steps,
like
my
fourth
grade
leprechaun
paper,
are
giant
leaps
and
some,
like
my
ninth
grade
journals,
are
tiny
baby
steps.
Some
of
the
steps
are
climbed
timidly,
like
my
first
year
seminar
writings,
while
other
steps
are
taken
overconfidently,
like
my
AP
research
paper.
But
no
matter
the
height
of
the
step
or
the
grade
of
the
paper,
each
represents
progress
in
my
writing
ability.
After
all,
my
ladder
may
never
reach
the
esteemed
heights
of
a
writer,
but
I
can
come
closer
with
every
step
I
take.
