My
History
as
a
Writer
WA
Preparation
Paper
August

1995
My
writing
experiences
over
the
last
fifteen
years
have
sculpted
me
into
a
competent
writer.
I
have
decided
that
writing
is
not
difficult
as
long
as
the
writer
has
the
information
and
the
details
and
a
structure
in
which
to
organize
that
information.
My
acedemic
as
well
as
personal
life
has
given
me
the
skills
necessary
for
expressing
myself
in
a
way
that
others
will
understand.
My
earliest
memory
of
writing
is
the
thank
you
letters
my
mother
forced
me
to
write
beginning
as
soon
as
I
could
form
letters
with
a
pen.
The
standard
thank
you
for
the
new
sweater
was
never
enough
for
Mom.
She
would
tell
me
to
write
one
more
descriptive
sentence
to
tell
the
giver
where
I
would
wear
the
sweater
or
that
it
was
my
favorite
color.
At
an
early
age,
I
was
taught
to
use
detail
and
support
my
statements.
At
this
point,
it
was
a
matter
of
politeness,
but
over
the
next
fifteen
years,
it
would
become
an
academic
necessity.
In
school,
my
first
vivid
memory
of
writing
was
Mrs.
Spear's
fourth
grade
class.
For
the
first
time
I
was
asked
to
keep
a
journal
in
which
I
could
write
anything
I
wanted
to,
as
long
as
I
wrote.
Verbal
and
written
expression
was
essential
and
unavoidable
in
her
classroom.
Having
to
articulate
my
thoughts
and
words
onto
a
written
page
daily
was
tough,
but
valuable
practice.
Mrs.
Spear
taught
us
how
to
organize
our
ideas
by
using
brainstorming
and
outlining
techniques.
One
assignment
she
gave
us
was
to
write
a
definition
essay
about
an
intangible
idea;
I
chose
to
define
friendship.
By
writing
friendship
in
the
center
of
a
page
and
drawing
related
ideas
around
it
I
was
able
to
see
what
I
was
writing
take
shape.
After
that,
an
outline
came
easily.
I
have
begun
each
paper
I
have
written
since
then
the
same
way.
So
I
began
my
writing
career
with
a
pen
and
paper,
brainstorming
and
outlining.
Junior
high
school
was
a
time
of
transition.
Our
family
bought
our
first
computer.
This
would
change
the
way
I
write
permanently.
With
the
word
processor
came
the
ability
to
edit
as
I
wrote.
My
papers
began
to
flow
better
as
I
could
move
entire
paragraphs
with
the
click
of
a
mouse
button.
It
was
easier
to
visualize
the
paper's
structure
on
the
computer
screen
than
scrawled
into
a
notebook.
However,
it
made
drafts
obsolete.
It
seems
more
efficient,
but
it
does
not
allow
for
the
careful
review
of
a
paper
as
the
first
copy
is
read,
recopied,
and
revised.
Also
in
junior
high
I
participated
in
a
program
which
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
write
more
unconventional
pieces,
mostly
as
a
member
of
a
group.
Collaborating
on
everything
from
scripts
for
mock
TV
game
shows
to
documentaries
and
historical
role-playing
meant
that
I
had
to
defend
every
word
I
wanted
to
add.
Working
with
peers
creates
a
natural
pressure
to
do
well.
Though
I
enjoyed
these
projects,
I
was
frustrated
by
the
unstructured
formats
and
began
to
develop
a
strong
preference
for
reports
and
articles,
more
organized
writing.
This
was
fine
because
as
I
got
older,
research
reports
became
the
norm
and
the
amount
of
creative
writing
I
did
was
diminished.
My
first
large
research
paper
was
assigned
in
eighth
grade.
I
chose
to
investigate
the
country
in
which
I
was
living
for
the
year,
Jordan.
I
went
to
three
libraries
and
read
innumerable
books
and
articles;
I
had
enough
information
to
write
volumes.
For
the
first
time,
I
had
to
sort
through
the
information
to
determine
what
was
important.
I
did
not
make
very
good
decisions
as
my
grade
later
reflected.
The
final
product
was
missing
some
vital
details
while
some
of
the
ones
I
included
were
minor.
My
first
exercise
in
extracting
the
important
information
from
the
less
important
was
a
failure,
but
I
learned
from
it.
Another
lesson
I
took
away
from
eighth
grade
was
how
to
organize
an
essay
or
paper.
Our
teacher,
Mrs.
Kasim,
drilled
into
our
heads
the
three
paragraph
structure
of
an
introduction,
body,
and
conclusion.
We
practiced
it
over
and
over
until
she
was
satisfied,
and
then
we
began
to
apply
the
theory
to
longer
works.
To
this
day,
I
still
follow
this
pattern.
That
year
impacted
my
writing
in
yet
a
third
way.
I
was
enrolled
in
a
private
school
overseas
for
eighth
grade
where
the
upper
school
was
seventh
grade
though
twelfth.
This
integration
meant
there
were
high
school
expectations
and
requirements.
These
high
expectations
led
to
greater
confidence
by
the
end
of
the
year,
so
when
I
entered
the
high
school
in
my
home
town
I
had
a
distinct
advantage.
Perhaps
my
writing
was
no
better
than
anyone
else's
but
I
knew
that
I
could
handle
the
work.
This
confidence
carried
over
all
four
years
of
high
school.
One
of
my
most
memorable
and
formative
assignments
in
high
school
after
returning
to
the
United
States
was
given
to
my
history
class
by
Mr.
Murray
junior
year.
The
task
was
to
research,
define,
and
present
a
hot
political
issue.
After
much
deliberation,
I
chose
to
write
about
the
dolphin-abusing
practices
of
tuna
fish
companies.
This
required
a
depth
of
research
I
had
never
done
before.
I
made
phone
calls
to
several
popular
brand
canning
companies,
sent
written
requests
for
information,
read
up
on
tuna
fishing
techniques,
called
conservationists
and
local
marine
scientists.
Research
is
an
essential
part
of
writing
a
good
paper.
Without
supporting
facts
and
details,
a
paper
is
weak
and
unconvincing.
This
eleventh
grade
exercise
helped
me
appreciate
the
value
of
good
research
while
also
gaining
the
skills
to
be
a
tenacious
researcher.
My
senior
year
of
high
school,
I
was
nominated
by
a
few
teachers
to
take
part
in
a
pilot
English
class.
I
was
chosen
on
the
basis
of
the
writing
I
had
done
for
these
teachers
over
the
past
three
years.
Their
goal
was
to
try
teach
us
on
a
college
level;
the
expectations
were
high
and
the
work
load
was
heavy.
The
six-person
class
was
intended
to
provide
an
intensive,
intellectual,
expressive
atmosphere.
We
discussed
the
papers
we
were
writing
at
the
beginning
of
each
class,
peer-edited
drafts,
and
shared
final
products.
The
input
from
the
others
was
valuable,
but
I
think
my
writing
benefited
the
most
by
listening
to
my
classmates'
pieces.
The
availability
of
one-on-one
time
with
the
teacher
made
it
possible
to
ask
the
questions
that
always
seemed
to
unimportant
to
bother
a
busy
class
of
thirty
with;
it
was
probably
the
course's
greatest
asset.
Mrs.
Barone
dissected
the
paper-writing
process,
breaking
it
down
and
rebuilding
it
for
us
to
make
sure
we
understood
the
basics.
For
the
first
semester,
she
separated
the
different
steps
into
staggered
deadlines.
This
helped
us
to
focus
on
the
importance
of
each
stage.
Slowly,
she
began
reducing
the
number
of
intermediate
steps,
until
finally
we
had
two
deadlines:
a
refined
rough
draft
and
a
polished
final
draft.
I
left
this
course
and
headed
toward
college
with
more
with
a
sense
of
accomplishment
and
courage,
as
well
as
a
guide
form.
College
writing
has
been
a
challenge,
but
one
for
which
I
feel
I
was
well
prepared.
My
First-Year
Seminar
was
exciting
and
I
attacked
the
paper
assignments
eagerly.
My
professor
stressed
transitions
and
logic;
making
sure
paragraphs
flowed
from
one
to
the
next
as
well
as
the
sentences
within
the
paragraph
was
a
key
goal.
With
only
these
skills,
a
paper
will
make
sense
to
anyone
who
reads
it
and
therefore
serve
it's
purpose.
Anything
else,
such
as
flowery
vocabulary,
is
superfluous.
The
assignments
I
have
had
so
far
in
college
have
mostly
been
very
straightforward
and
specific
(I
thrive
on
that).
Psychology
and
biology
lab
reports
have
specific
formats
to
guide
me.
When
provided
with
that
framework,
a
paper's
difficulty
becomes
the
research
and
the
writing
is
automatic.
In
addition
to
the
skills
and
techniques
I
have
been
taught,
there
are
traits
inherent
within
me
that
make
me
the
writer
I
am.
I
have
a
natural
tendency
to
ask
questions
about
everything.
This
is
reflected
in
paper-writing,
hopefully
avoiding
loose
ends
and
answering
the
question
Why?
before
it
is
asked
by
a
reader.
I
have
a
more
analytical
than
creative
thought
process,
so
I
can
approach
writing
as
a
process
with
different
steps.
I
think
this
is
an
advantage
because
the
organization
of
the
procedure
is
reflected
within
the
paper.
It
also
adds
to
the
substance
of
my
arguments.
Of
the
many
papers
I
have
written,
from
an
analysis
of
The
White
Hotel
to
a
report
of
the
memory
capacity
of
bumblebees,
to
a
description
of
how
women
are
portrayed
in
advertising,
the
goal
has
always
been
to
analyze
and
articulate
results
or
observations.
I
feel
this
is
a
one
of
my
strengths.
I
must
also
include
my
inclination
to
procrastinate
as
a
factor
in
my
writing.
I
know
that
I
focus
much
better
on
the
task
at
hand
when
there
is
not
much
time
to
do
it.
I
will
sit
down
and
write
instead
of
writing
a
sentence
and
wandering
away
as
I
do
when
I
have
all
the
time
in
the
world.
I
cannot
decide
if
it
helps
or
hurts.
It
is
something
that
teachers,
professors,
and
parents
have
been
trying
to
break
me
of
for
years.
I
think
my
parents
had
a
lot
to
do
with
the
writer
I
have
become.
Reading
and
writing
were
strongly
encouraged
throughout
my
childhood.
My
mother,
a
journalist
and
moon-lighting
book
editor,
spent
a
lot
of
time
proof-reading
my
papers,
emphasizing
grammar,
varied
sentence
structure,
and
logical
format.
My
father
has
an
enormous
vocabulary
that
he
incorporates
into
his
regular
speech
patterns.
To
this
day
when
I
ask
him
what
a
word
that
he
just
used
means,
he
sends
me
to
the
dictionary
saying
the
obligatory
look
it
up,
young
lady.
This
history
has
produced
a
college-level
writer
who
is
not
afraid
of
a
paper
assignment.
I
look
forward
to
the
process,
beginning
with
research
and
ending
with
a
gleaming
final
package.
There
is
nothing
more
satisfying
than
handing
in
a
paper,
confident
in
it's
quality.
However,
there
is
nothing
more
disturbing
than
handing
in
something
less
than
my
best.
The
process
does
not
always
work:
there
will
always
be
topics
that
do
not
excite
me;
I
will
always
procrastinate.
These
faults
lead
to
me
to
conclude
that
I
have
come
a
long
way,
but
that
I
have
a
lot
of
room
for
improvement.
