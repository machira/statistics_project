Writing
Like
a
WA

August

Re-reading
and
Re-writing
the
Past
Year
A
greater
part
of
the
last
ten
months
of
my
life
has
been
spent
in
a
basement
computer
lab
furiously
pounding
out
five
to
seven
page
essays
on
topics
ranging
from
Shakespeare
to
Derrida.
My
year
in
Oxford
involved
much
more
independent
writing
then
I
anticipated,
which
forced
me
to
put
the
WA
skills
I
acquired
as
a
second
year
student
to
work
in
a
more
personal
way.
Writing
in
Oxford
takes
place
in
relative
isolation,
especially
when
compared
with
writing
at
Lafayette.
Not
only
was
I
called
upon
to
generate
and
evaluate
my
own
drafts,
but
to
create
my
topics
and
evaluate
and
question
my
forty
plus
final
products.
The
free
reign
I
endured
during
my
year
abroad
was
much
more
frustrating
then
the
writing
restrictions
I
enjoyed
at
Lafayette.
The
writing
process
I
had
partially
developed
at
Lafayette
became
the
only
writing
check
on
which
I
could
rely.
Before
detailing
how
I
put
these
checks
to
work,
it
might
be
useful
to
trace
their
conception
and
development,
which
largely
occurred
within
the
WA
program.
My
introduction
to
the
program
coincided
with
my
first
class
at
Lafayette
(my
FYS).
My
first
WA
helped
me
recognize
the
flaws
in
my
writing,
and
to
see
that
they
were
not
insurmountable
obstacles,
or
even
anything
that
required
tears.
I
emerged
from
my
FYS
armed
with
a
clear
understanding
of
the
necessity
and
purpose
of
a
thesis
statement,
the
desire
to
question
my
own
writing
and
the
willingness
to
receive
and
process
feedback
from
my
peers
as
well
as
my
professors.
These
tools
were
further
developed
in
my
first
year
writing
course,
which
concentrated
on
poetry
and
the
analytical
process.
Writing
about
poetry
not
only
strengthened
my
analytical
skills,
but
exposed
the
infinite
possibilities
of
language
to
me;
allowing
me
to
see
the
dimensions
existing
and
multiplying
within
my
own
writing,
as
well
as
the
dimensions
other's
writing
inhabits.
These
dimensions
continued
to
expand
during
my
second
year
at
Lafayette,
when
I
became
involved
with
the
WA
program
not
only
as
a
writer,
but
as
a
reader.
Reading
other
students
papers
sensitized
me
to
the
boundaries
of
peer
criticism
and
strengthened
my
ability
to
identify
the
weak
places
in
almost
all
essay.
Most
of
my
time
as
a
WA
was
spent
discussing
introductions
and
theses
with
students.
A
strong
thesis
serves
as
a
reference
point
for
most
writers.
If
a
writer
can
read
each
paragraph
in
terms
of
his
or
her
thesis
statement,
making
sure
that
the
topic
sentence
builds
upon
the
central
question,
while
not
repeating
it,
then
he
or
she
has
built
a
structure
in
which
his
or
her
writing
can
grow
(into
clarity
as
well
as
abstraction).
The
difficult
part
of
the
structuring
process
for
me
was
allowing
the
students
to
discover
the
structure
themselves.
Often,
I
would
find
myself
asking
questions
which
were
too
leading
and
taking
students
essays
to
the
conclusion
I
saw
as
logical,
while
forgetting
that
they
may
have
other
conclusions
in
mind.
Sometimes
preventing
myself
from
penciling
in
the
next
step
on
a
student's
paper,
or
blatantly
mentioning
it
during
our
session
was
frustrating.
It
was
difficult
for
me
to
be
satisfied
with
the
conclusion
and
structure
the
student
developed;
at
first,
I
saw
the
essay
I
developed
from
the
skeleton
the
student
often
brought
me
as
much
more
satisfying.
One
particular
student
insisted
that
his
thesis
was
something
to
the
effect
of,
I
hate
this
poem
because,
and
after
thirty
minutes
of
persuading
I
found
it
impossible
to
change
his
mind
about
the
effectiveness
of
his
chosen
thesis.
It
was
difficult
to
see
this
student
walking
out
of
the
room
with
his
thesis
largely
intact.
Luckily
the
grade
his
professor
stuck
on
his
final
draft
was
more
persuasive,
and
the
next
time
we
met
the
dialogue
was
much
more
open.
My
experiences
as
a
WA
have
taught
me
the
importance
of
maintaining
a
guise
of
objectivity
as
a
reader
of
student
writing,
despite
the
impossibility
of
a
reader
ever
truly
occupying
such
as
position.
Working
with
a
professor
unaffiliated
with
the
WA
program,
during
my
second
semester
as
a
WA
helped
me
to
further
cultivate
my
position
as
a
WA.
Professors
outside
of
the
program
do
not
design
their
assignments
with
the
WA
in
mind
as
do
professor
working
within
the
program;
therefore
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
design
general
questions
and
directions
for
the
students
which
they
could
use
during
the
creation
of
their
final
drafts
(these
guidelines
were
developed
with
the
aid
of
a
written
outline
by
the
professor).
These
guidelines
allowed
me
to
fall
into
a
general
routine
when
reading
drafts,
which
I
could
then
apply
on
a
personal
level
to
each
student.
I
could
then
avoid
appearing
to
attack
a
student's
paper
on
a
personal
level.
Instead
of
attempting
to
persuade
a
student
that
hating
something
was
not
a
strong
basis
for
discussion,
I
could
present
them
with
a
general
argument
that
proved
hating
to
be
a
fallible
basis
for
the
questioning
process
which
is
the
base
of
most
academic
writing.
My
time
as
a
WA
has
been
spent
on
this
general
level,
which
helps
me
to
understand
the
experience
I
had
with
my
VAST
WA.
The
professor
of
this
particular
VAST
required
a
significant
number
of
drafts,
which
allowed
the
members
of
the
class
to
approach
their
writing
from
interesting
angles.
We
were
even
required
to
combine
several
different
scientific
essays
into
a
newspaper
article
geared
to
the
general
public.
Although
the
assignments
were
interesting,
I
found
my
experience
with
the
class'
WA
to
be
less
than
satisfying.
She
repeatedly
told
me
that
my
paper
was
good,
and
forgot
to
offer
any
strong
suggestions.
My
roommate
became
my
real
WA,
and
I
did
not
get
much
out
of
my
experience
with
the
VAST's
WA.
Recently
I
went
back
and
re-read
one
of
my
papers
from
this
class
and
although
it
was
strong
in
some
places,
I
was
dissatisfied
with
many
parts.
My
WA
had
commented
nothing
on
this
paper
and
I
remember
our
meeting
lasting
less
then
ten
minutes
at
the
end
of
which
she
told
me
another
draft
was
not
necessary.
In
a
way
I
understand
what
happened.
I
am
not
sure
how
I
would
deal
with
papers
on
a
level
beyond
structure.
I
am
not
a
grammarian,
as
I
am
sure
she
was
not,
but
there
must
be
some
way
she
could
of
engaged
with
my
writing
beyond
the
structural
level.
One
of
the
things
I
would
like
to
work
on
this
year
is
engaging
with
others
writing
and
my
own
beyond
a
structural
level.
General
guidelines
seem
to
disappear
and
the
terms
become
much
more
amorphous
and
personal
when
one
addresses
a
writer's
essay
outside
of
its
structural
context.
Although
I
have
begun
to
be
concerned
with
writing
issues
outside
of
structure,
I
have
far
from
mastered
it.
My
year
in
Oxford
made
the
difficulty
of
maintaining
structure
painfully
clear
to
me.
Generating
two
analytical
essays
a
week
prevented
me
from
giving
structure
the
consideration
I
had
time
for
at
Lafayette
(especially
with
no
one
to
remind
me
of,
or
reinforce,
my
writing
checks).
My
writing
environment
did
not
always
help.
Wadham
College's
ill
equipped
basement/dungeon
computer
lab,
whose
temperature
on
a
cool
day
hovered
around
eighty
degrees
Fahrenheit
was
not
anyone's
idea
of
an
ideal
writing
milieu.
But,
since
buying
a
computer
was
too
expensive
and
writing
by
hand
too
time
consuming,
I
had
no
choice
but
to
spend
my
days
huddled
like
a
sardine
in
a
tank
top
next
to
other
furiously
typing
and
sweating
students.
Wadham's
computer
lab
would
make
anyone
rush
the
writing
process,
and
I
confess
that
a
few
times
bypassed
careful
proofreading,
but
for
the
most
part
the
re-reading
and
re-writing
I
did
at
Lafayette
traveled
with
me
to
Oxford.
My
Romantics
tutor
even
stated
in
one
of
her
evaluations
that
my
essays
were
immaculately
prepared.
I
hope
she
was
referring
to
the
writing,
and
not
the
tasteful
font
I
carefully
selected
for
each
essay.
I
do
have
serious
doubts
about
the
writing
I
did
at
Oxford.
In
some
ways
I
think
the
freedom
I
was
allowed
at
Oxford
made
my
writing
sloppier.
There
was
no
one
to
carefully
question
and
evaluate
it
as
there
is
at
Lafayette.
I
attempted
to
have
one
of
my
roommates
read
an
essay
I
wrote,
but
I
was
incredibly
dissatisfied
with
the
approach
she
chose.
Instead
of
her
reading
generating
questions
which
I
could
use
in
another
draft,
she
re-wrote
my
sentences
and
relied
on
the
twenty
page
paper
she
had
written
on
the
same
book
to
criticize
my
reading.
I
found
her
re-writes
particularly
offensive
and
when
I
explained
to
her
that
it
made
me
feel
as
if
she
was
ghost
writing
my
paper,
she
also
became
a
little
angry.
Pointing
out
that
she
was
a
writing
tutor
at
Sarah
Lawrence,
and
subtly
working
in
the
strength
of
their
writing
programs,
did
not
do
anything
to
change
the
color
of
my
face.
Eventually
we
forgave
each
other,
but
in
order
to
maintain
peace
in
our
house
I
never
offered
a
housemate
another
essay.
She
continued
to
ask
me
to
read
her
essays,
but
I
quickly
realized
that
she
was
looking
more
for
confirmation
then
constructive
criticism,
so
I
would
simply
tell
her
that
we
had
different
writing
styles:
her
approach
being
what
I
would
call
grandiose
and
unmanageable,
while
mine
is
more
practical.
Maybe
our
interests
were
too
similar
and
although
we
could
learn
a
lot
from
each
other
in
conversation,
our
writing
styles
were
something
on
which
we
were
unable
to
compromise.
The
incident
with
my
roommate
just
reinforces
for
me
the
importance
of
maintaining
a
distance
in
the
reader/writer
relationship.
It
also
reinforces
for
me
the
strengths
of
Lafayette's
WA
program.
Re-writing
a
student's
sentences
would
be
a
major
infraction
for
any
WA,
as
would
superimposing
one's
reading
on
a
student's
paper.
Being
on
the
receiving
end
of
these
suggestion
re-taught
me
the
necessity
of
respecting
a
writer's
work
and
the
difference
between
constructive
questioning
and
forcing
changes.
I
am
looking
forward
to
Lafayette
and
measuring
the
gains
and
losses
I
have
made
during
my
year
abroad.
Returning
to
the
WA
program
and
a
community
who
discusses
writing
will
be
a
welcomed
change.
Hopefully,
I
will
develop
new
writing
strategies
and
strengthen
the
ones
I
already
have,
while
learning
more
about
the
discussion
of
writing
and
just
what
exactly
constructive
criticism
entails.
The
papers
I
furiously
pound
out
in
Lafayette's
computer
labs
will
be
much
more
rewarding,
not
just
because
they
will
have
been
created
in
a
temperature
controlled
environment,
but
because
there
will
be
a
larger
and
more
open
audience
to
receive
them.
