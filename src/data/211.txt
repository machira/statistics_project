WA
Assignment
I
decided
to
begin
my
writing
history
in
the
small
Catholic
school
I
attended
from
fourth
grade
up
to
eight-grade.
I
am
not
Catholic
but
transferred
schools
willingly
because
the
alternative
was
attending
an
overcrowded
public
school.
I
don't
regret
that
decision
but
I
hated
every
minute
of
it.
Sister
Joy
had
jury
duty
the
end
of
that
year
so
it
was
up
to
Mrs.
Hennessey
to
teach
us
in
the
afternoon.
They
crammed
the
two
small
classes
of
6th
graders
into
one
room.
It
was
only
May,
but
the
heat
and
humidity
were
already
at
levels
that
made
it
impossible
to
remain
coherent,
but
we
didn't
have
to.
As
long
as
we
appeared
conscious
and
didn't
contribute
to
the
heat.,
we
got
an
A
for
the
afternoon.
I
was
assigned
to
sit
next
to
a
very
Italian/Catholic
girl
named
Nina
Ruffini
for
the
three
week
sentence.
She
was
viewed
as
a
sort
of
celebrity,
even
by
the
teachers.
Her
father
owned
Ruffini
s
Restaurant'
and
every
boy
in
the
6th
grade
had
a
crush
on
her.
As
for
me,
I
was
not
impressed
by
her,
but
more
by
everyone
else's
fascination
with
her.
After
one
particularly
long
and
painful
lecture,
we
were
assigned
to
write
a
story
that
centered
around
the
day
in
the
life
of
a
role
model.
I
wanted
to
pick
something
that
would
be
inappropriate
and
insulting
to
the
teacher
that
just
inflicted
the
hour
long
lecture
that
I
was
just
forced
to
sit-through.
What
I
eventually
came
up
with
was
A
day
in
the
life
of
Fido.
The
story
impressed
Nina.
The
story
impressed
everyone
at
the
table
and
surrounding
desks.
Everyone
wanted
to
now
what
happened
to
Fido
next.
For
a
brief
moment
in
time,
I
held
my
own
6th
grade
celebrity
status.
I
later
handed
a
clean
version
into
the
teacher.
My
status
quickly
waned
and
gladly
returned
to
my
former
position
in
sixth
grade
society.
The
discovery
that
I
could
manipulate
and
control
an
environment
that
I
consistently
found
hostile
empowered
me.
I
felt
like
I
had
stumbled
upon
a
huge
secret.
I
was
afraid
to
share
it
with
anyone.
From
that
instant
on,
my
style
of
writing
split
into
two
very
distinct
categories:
strictly
personal
and
politically
correct.
I
used
to
write
what
I
felt
was
honest.
Now
when
I
had
to
write
something
for
class,
I
would
write
specifically
for
the
audience.
I
have
to
admit
that
I
got
off
writing
something
that
teachers
thought
was
great,
but
was
not
representative
of
me
at
all.
In
Catholic
high
school,
I
thought
that
things
would
be
different.
It
was
a
different
school,
but
the
situation
only
worsened.
At
times
I
felt
like
I
was
living
two
separate
lives.
Without
going
into
details,
lets
just
say
I
was
very
unhappy.
In
my
sophomore
year
I
decided
to
actually
take
up
a
New
Years
resolution,
I
decided
to
keep
a
journal
of
my
thoughts.
No
grammar
rules.
Whatever
I
wanted
to
talk
about,
but
it
had
to
be
at
least
one
page
in
length.
It
was
the
hardest
writing
assignment
I
have
had
to
date.
I
discovered
I
was
really
awful
at
expressing
what
I
thought
were
simple
feelings.
I
would
write
three
pages
worth
of
what
was
essentially
the
same
idea,
I
realized
this
at
the
time
and
it
frustrated
me.
But
I
kept
on
writing.
A
funny
thing
happened.
As
I
kept
with
my
journal,
I
learned
that
my
thoughts
were
not
always
what
I
thought
them
to
be
until
I
wrote
them
down.
Organizing
and
distinguishing
my
anger
from
my
ambition
allowed
me
to
discern
who
I
was
and
who
I
wanted
to
be.
I
had
begun
writing
in
January.
By
February
and
March
the
journal
entries
were
eight
to
ten
pages
in
length.
The
handwriting
was
erratic
and
disturbed
in
appearance.
I
hadn't
noticed
this
until
about
October
and
November
after
I
had
made
the
decision
to
transfer
to
Public
school
for
my
last
two
years
of
high
school.
After
I
transferred,
the
journal
entries
were
down
to
two
to
three
pages
and
the
handwriting
was
no
longer
hostile.
I
never
completed
the
year-long
assignment.
I
remember,
I
had
three
days
left
to
go.
I
purposely
never
finished
it.
The
assignment
was
no
longer
about
parameters.
I
discovered
that
writing
can
be
more
than
a
good
story
or
a
way
to
document
an
event.
It
has
the
ability
to
change
who
you
are
and
how
you
see
the
world.
During
my
senior
year
of
high
school
I
decided
to
take
advanced
placement
English
with
Mr.
Hudson.
Mr.
Hudson
is
one
of
those
teachers
you
fear
but
respect.
The
assignments
were
pretty
straight
forward
and
what
you
would
expect,
except
he
encouraged
originality.
The
challenge
with
Hudson
was
that
the
man
was
actually
intelligent.
There
was
no
possibility
of
pulling
bull****
with
him.
Even
worse,
he
would
humiliate
you
in
front
of
the
class
if
you
tried
to
pull
anything.
I
was
terrified,
but
in
a
great
way.
Mr.
Hudson
was
my
first
experience
with
academic
writing.
The
purpose
of
the
entire
course
was
to
prepare
us
for
the
advanced
placement
tests.
I
did
OK
on
the
test,
but
what
I
know
about
writing
papers
today
stems
directly
from
that
class
and
Mr.
Hudson.
What
I
discovered
is
that
I
had
no
concept
of
organization.
ABSOLUTELY
NONE.
I
had
no
concept
of
introduction,
development,
and
conclusion.
He
handed
out
a
copy
of
a
paper
and
briefly
explained
the
structure.
I
remember
being
embarrassed
at
my
cluelessness,
but
the
feeling
of
the
revelation
soon
compensated
for
that
sensation.
I
was
distrustful
of
the
constrained
structure,
but
marveled
at
its
effectiveness.
I
am
not
kidding-I
am
not
making
this
up.
You
would
be
surprised
that
teachers
forget
to
emphasize
or
explain
the
basics.
Thank
you
Hudson.
The
end
of
my
sophomore
year
in
college
I
went
abroad.
My
experience
with
professors
in
Europe
was
mixed.
One
professor
basically
told
me
I
shouldn't
even
be
an
English
major.
She
is
a
very
nice
woman
but
is
essentially
a
nutcase
I
admit
that
paper
I
wrote
for
her
was
probably
closer
to
poor
than
I
would
like
to
admit.
Regardless,
it
scared
the
hell
out
of
me
because
I
had
just
dropped
my
Engineering
major
for
English.
About
two
days
later
my
Philosophy
professor
told
me
that
I
wrote
an
excellent
paper.
I
decided
that
if
I
could
write
a
good
paper
that
involved
abstract
ideas
and
effectively
communicated
them
to
a
professor
I
probably
had
a
fighting
chance
with
the
English
major.
When
I
returned
to
school
the
next
semester
I
started
writing
for
the
newspaper.
I
don't
really
understand
my
motivations
for
joining.
I
hate
reading
newspapers,
but
I
enjoyed
my
Writing
for
the
Media
class
I
took
while
I
was
abroad.
I
just
wanted
to
try
it
out.
One
of
my
first
assignments
was
writing
about
the
integration
of
guns
onto
campus.
I
was
so
scared.
It
was
completely
different
that
writing
a
paper.
The
pressure
to
write
a
good
article
was
not
about
a
grade.
It
was
about
accurately
and
factually
reporting
an
article
that
my
peers
would
read.
If
I
screwed
up
there
were
real
consequences.
The
articles
that
followed
were
mediocre
at
best.
But
I
eventually
caught
on.
I
got
better.
I
learned.
I
started
to
read
the
paper
on
a
regular
basis.
My
biggest
difficulty
was
recognizing
my
improvement.
You
don't
have
a
grade
to
tell
you
how
you
are
doing.
I
would
ask
the
editors
for
feedback.
I
sent
articles
home
to
mom
and
dad.
I
got
my
friend's
opinions.
I
still
have
a
difficult
time
getting
a
feel
of
the
level
of
my
work.
I
just
work
hard
to
make
sure
that
I
am
improving
all
the
time.
I
figure
that
as
long
as
I
improve
on
a
consistent
basis,
understanding
exactly
where
I
am
is
not
as
important.
Newspaper
writing,
more
specifically
news
writing,
has
heavily
shaped
my
style.
I
started
to
write
my
papers
differently
for
my
classes.
I
became
more
direct
and
my
sentences
were
less
wordy.
The
way
I
organized
my
thoughts
on
the
page
was
more
straight
forward.
Overall
there
was
an
improvement
in
my
writing
that
did
show
itself
with
a
letter
grade
I
could
see.
The
most
significant
lesson
I
gained
from
writing
for
The
Lafayette
was
responsibility.
The
newspaper
is
not
a
class.
You
don't
receive
a
grade.
You
are
the
only
source
of
motivation
to
research
and
create
a
piece
of
respectable
literature.
When
you
write
a
paper
for
a
class,
you
are
usually
given
somewhat
specific
guidelines.
There
is
an
expectation
the
professor
has
for
the
paper.
When
you
write
an
article,
there
are
no
guidelines
or
limits.
It
is
up
to
you
to
judge
how
far
you
should
go
with
the
research.
You
are
the
only
person
who
has
the
knowledge
to
judge
if
the
work
you
put
into
the
article
is
adeguate
or
excellent.
Asking
myself
if
I
have
done
enough
for
an
article
has
never
been
an
easy
guestion
to
answer.
This
past
summer
I
had
an
internship
at
a
smaller
magazine
called
Philadelphia
Enterpriser
Magazine.
I
was
their
first
college
intern
so
nobody
knew
what
was
expected.
My
official
title
was
Editorial
Intern
but
I
did
everything
from
writing
articles,
advertising,
to
picking
up
lunch
for
the
office.
The
most
difficult
part
of
the
internship
was
working
with
the
Editor.
I
was
terrified.
I
had
been
thrust
upon
her
and
we
really
did
not
know
what
to
expect
of
each
other.
I
could
only
imagine
that
her
worst
fear
was
that
I
would
write
a
terrible
article
and
it
would
have
to
be
salvaged
on
her
time.
There
was
a
tension
between
us
until
I
handed
in
my
first
pair
of
articles.
She
liked
them!
Having
someone
outside
of
a
academic
setting
approve
of
my
work
surprised
me.
I
had
never
been
this
nervous
awaiting
the
feedback
of
an
individual.
This
was
not
mind-blowing
literature,
but
it
was
my
favorite
type
of
writing,
magazine
writing.
I
have
loved
magazines
since
a
young
age.
I
actually
have
showed
up
to
appointments
early
if
I
knew
the
doctors
office
had
a
decent
selection
of
magazines
at
my
disposal.
Presently,
as
I
sit
here
finishing
my
Literacy
Narrative,
I
am
reminded
of
the
role
of
the
lap
top
computer.
I
have
tried
to
write
without
it
and
frankly,
without
it
I
am
crippled.
It
is
not
so
much
the
spell
check
or
the
thesaurus.
For
me
it
is
the
ability
to
rearrange
what
I
am
writing.
I
will
often
write
several
sentences
to
start
a
paragraph
and
then
have
several
versions
following
them.
When
I
have
to
do
this
on
paper,
it
takes
forever.
When
I
am
forced
to
write
with
the
old
fashion
paper
and
pen
I
am
very
lazy
and
the
guality
is
never
as
good
as
it
could
be
on
the
computer.
