Reading,
Writing,
and
Writing
for
ReadingOs
Sake:
A
Literacy
Narrative
I
have
a
feeling
that
my
mother
takes
credit
for
my
yen
for
writing.
She
often
recounts
that
in
my
infancy,
she
treated
me
as
a
compact
confidante,
telling
me
the
details
of
her
day
and
her
feelings
as
we
ate,
played,
and
napped
together.
Her
thoughtNand
mineNis
that
absorbing
this
constant
narrative
must
have
helped
forge
my
hunger
for
stories,
ideas,
and
words
in
general,
a
hunger
which
reveals
itself
in
my
love
of
reading,
and
by
extension
my
love
of
writing.
As
I
recall,
I
learned
to
read
not
only
through
learning
letters,
but
also
by
hunting
for
stories.
During
our
nightly
read-alouds,
my
mom
would
prompt
me
to
look
at
a
page
and
OreadO
it
by
telling
the
story
that
I
saw
happening
in
the
illustration.
She
would
follow
my
projection
with
the
actual
story
on
the
page,
and
I
would
learn
the
visual
difference
between
my
sentence
and
the
bookOs
precise
wording.
Once
half
a
year
of
kindergarten
put
more
accurate
reading
under
my
belt,
I
craved
more
and
more
material.
I
quickly
surmised
that
the
best
way
for
me
to
find
stories
I
would
want
to
read
would
be
to
make
these
stories
myself,
but
to
do
so
I
had
to
learn
to
write.
Some
of
my
earliest
writings
graced
the
back
of
my
kindergarten
classOs
Valentines,
where
I
copied
the
names
that
my
ever-encouraging
mother
spelled
out
for
me
on
a
separate
sheet
of
paper.
As
soon
as
my
fingers
cooperated
with
proper
form
and
spelling,
I
set
out
to
write
the
kind
of
material
that
I
wanted
to
read,
using
my
preferred
genreNthe
picture
bookNas
my
guide.
My
first
substantial
writings
are
more
cave
paintings
than
novels:
stapled
notebook
pages
of
illustrated
action
with
words
scrawled
in
to
label
key
elements.
The
mechanics
of
my
writing
may
not
have
been
sophisticatedNor
even
understandable,
except
for
the
carefully
checked
spellingNbut
at
least
to
me,
it
was
readable.
All
the
writing
I
did
in
the
first
one
or
two
years
of
elementary
school,
when
the
ability
to
write
was
a
goal
but
not
yet
a
requirement,
sprang
untrained
from
my
enjoyment
of
reading.
My
mechanicsNgrammar,
spelling,
handwriting,
number
of
wordsNeventually
improved,
not
out
of
concentrated
effort,
but
because
I
wanted
them
to
better
resemble
published
books,
because
I
wanted
them
to
be
more
Oreadable.O
Playing
author
and
audience
as
I
did,
writing
and
its
improvement
were
one
and
the
same;
each
sentence
had
to
be
better
than
the
last,
or
else
I
would
have
had
no
desire
to
read
it
in
the
first
place.
As
I
passed
into
later
elementary
school
and
the
ability
to
write
transitioned
from
nice
to
normative,
writing
for
school
challenged
my
writer/reader
motivation.
If
writing
was
my
quest
for
reading
satisfaction,
then
what
motivation
did
I
have
for
writing
a
summary
of
NBear
Sleeps
InO
in
first
grade,
or
a
character
sketch
of
Timothy
from
The
Cay
in
sixth
grade?
Luckily
for
my
academic
prospects,
my
natural
deference
to
authority
took
over
where
my
intellectual
curiosity
could
no
longer
propel
me,
and
writing
became
for
me
inextricably
linked
with
English
class:
just
another
school
subject
to
master
as
well
as
I
could.
My
English
curriculum
in
elementary
and
middle
school
consisted
of
learning
the
formats
and
patterns
of
how
to
write
well.
Starting
with
basic
punctuation
and
subject-predicate
sentence
structure,
I
took
each
new
format
to
heart,
and
made
it
a
point
never
to
write
a
sentence
without
a
subject
in
the
same
way
that
I
would
never
divide
by
zero
in
math.
Writing
became
a
subject
of
its
own,
governed
by
hard
and
fast
rules
that
I
luckily
picked
up
easily,
most
likely
because
I
had
always
been
unknowingly
absorbing
them
in
my
precious
books.
In
elementary
school,
there
was
little
composition
emphasis;
worksheets
with
queries
about
short
stories
or
textbooks
were
taken
home
and
answeredNin
complete
sentencesNin
small
print
on
the
same
sheet
with
the
aid
of
a
pencil
and
a
lot
of
eraser.
Occasionally
I
would
have
to
write
a
short
answer
for
social
studies
class,
but
mainly
writing
became
tangled
up
with
English
class.
I
began
to
forget
that
creativity
had
anything
to
do
with
writing;
with
neither
the
scope
nor
the
reason
to
worry
about
the
sound
of
what
I
was
writing,
or
the
precision
of
the
elementary
vocabulary
words
I
was
using,
I
focused
only
on
getting
the
answers
right.
With
middle
school
came
(comparatively)
lengthy
writing,
which,
as
I
discovered,
I
could
also
complete
successfully
with
no
motivation
other
than
following
the
proper
rules.
My
school
district
strongly
believed
in
equipping
young
writers
with
structures
and
templates
that
they
could
master
early
and
then
apply
to
their
more
mature
writings.
As
a
result,
in
sixth
grade
I
learned
the
OcorrectO
structure
of
a
paragraph:
an
introductory
sentence,
followed
by
a
thesis,
three
supporting
sentences,
and
a
conclusion.
My
teachers,
I
think,
wanted
me
to
simply
learn
the
pattern
of
writing
a
thesis
and
defending
it,
so
that
when
I
later
read
complex
books
and
formed
complex
opinions,
I
would
be
able
to
focus
all
my
energy
on
conveying
my
message,
the
structure
falling
into
place
after
years
of
rote
memorization.
At
least,
that
would
explain
why
my
earliest
paragraph
papers
defended
theses
like
Nmy
bedroom
is
the
best
room
in
the
house.O
The
lesson
plan
certainly
did
emblazon
logical
structure
into
my
mind,
but
as
a
side
effect,
it
suggested
that
the
actual
ideas
I
conveyed
counted
for
little
in
my
middle
school
papers.
The
paragraph
structure,
as
well
as
the
three-
and
five-
paragraph
composition
structures
that
followed
in
seventh
and
eighth
grade,
seemed
almost
like
a
Mad
Lib
puzzle
to
me,
where
it
didnOt
matter
what
words
I
put
in
a
blank,
as
long
as
they
were
the
right
types
of
words
for
the
blank.
My
early
composition-writing
process
reflected
an
almost
mechanical
approach
to
writing
papers
that
were
worth
only
a
grade
to
me.
When
my
family
finally
broke
down
and
bought
a
computer
before
I
started
sixth
grade,
I
began
doing
all
my
assigned
writing
electronically.
However,
my
one-
and
three-
paragraph
papers
were
essentially
draftless,
as
were
the
even
less
inspired
reports
I
had
to
perfunctorily
write
for
history
and
science.
I
would
type
each
sentence
as
I
thought
it,
going
back
after
I
was
done
only
to
run
spell
check
and
to
make
sure
that
I
hadnOt
overlooked
any
typos.
I
canOt
recall
a
single
instance
of
going
back
to
change
a
word
because
another
word
fit
better,
or
because
another
phrasing
was
more
economical;
as
long
as
I
had
the
right
number
and
types
of
sentences,
and
I
had
answered
all
the
questions
in
the
prompt,
I
knew
that
my
paper
would
be
fine.
High
school
brought
with
it
more
complicated
rules
to
follow,
but
still
no
substitution
for
the
motivation
that
had
bettered
my
writing
in
my
youth.
In
ninth
grade,
I
ingested
the
specifics
of
the
compare
and
contrast
paper,
with
its
block
or
point-counterpoint
forms,
and
also
had
my
first
experience
writing
persuasive
papers
and
speeches
rather
than
basic
arguments.
However,
I
still
had
no
pressing
desire
to
write
my
papers,
because
I
still
had
no
clue
as
to
how
I
could
bring
any
passion
to
writing
something
I
wouldnOt
enjoy
reading.
Where
learning
style
was
concerned,
I
aped
pleasant
vocabulary
from
my
reading,
and
adhered
to
my
teachersO
rules
about
limiting
passive
voice
and
varying
sentence
openingsNat
least
in
English
classNbut
I
never
read
through
my
work
to
appreciate
or
critique
any
of
uses
of
language
or
ideas.
Neither
did
I
fathom
that
I
could
improve
the
flow
and
feeling
of
my
work
by
reading
and
revising,
like
a
chef
would
season
to
taste.
Instead,
I
made
charts
of
all
my
papers
while
writing
them,
keeping
track
on
the
back
of
my
assignment
sheet
the
number
of
sentences
in
each
paragraph,
the
number
of
ObeO
verbs
I
used,
the
word
count
of
each
sentence,
and
the
word
that
began
each
sentences,
so
that
I
would
know
that
my
paper
would
sound
right,
without
reading
through
it
to
feel
for
whether
it
would
sound
good.
The
issue
of
writing
well
without
motivation
reached
a
turning
point
in
Mr.
DietrichOs
Tenth
Grade
Honors
English
class.
Mr.
Dietrich,
whose
mantra
was
Ngood
readers
make
good
writers,O
unknowingly
reopened
the
door
to
inspiration
in
an
annual
parent-teacher
conference
with
my
mother.
With
my
latest
paper
in
hand,
an
argument
essay
about
justice
in
the
Orpheus
myth,
Mr.
Dietrich
praised
my
abilities
as
a
writer,
specifically
my
diction.
He
noted
a
sentence
in
which
I
described
the
defeated
Orpheus
as
a
NlovelornO
wanderer.
My
mom
said
that
he
looked
up
from
the
page
he
was
reading
and
shrugged
his
shoulders,
while
musing,
NWhat
teenager
uses
the
word
lovelorn?O
Up
to
this
point,
it
had
never
struck
me
as
odd
that
I
was
a
teenager
who
used
the
word
lovelorn,
or
that
I
preferred
terribly
to
very,
and
innocuous
to
harmless.
A
long
history
of
reading
had,
in
addition
to
stimulating
my
early
growth
as
a
writer,
supplied
me
with
a
considerably
dense
arsenal
of
words
and
phrasings.
I
never
found
it
remarkable,
most
likely
because
no
teacher
had
ever
commented
on
it
before.
Before
tenth
grade,
I
had
never
heard
a
teacher
critique
my
work
as
a
piece
of
reading
material.
I
knew
that
my
instructors
deemed
me
a
OgoodO
writer,
because
they
gave
me
high
marks
and
noted
the
completeness
of
my
papers
and
the
correctness
of
my
grammar,
but
they
never
made
me
realize
that
people
might
read
my
work
as
I
read
Fitzgerald,
whom
I
discovered
in
tenth
grade,
with
an
appreciation
for
the
way
words
flowed
and
the
concepts
sentences
suggested.
The
next
time
I
wrote
a
paper,
my
will
to
continue
impressing
Mr.
Dietrich
kept
me
focused
on
using
the
best
words
I
knew.
As
I
scanned
my
paper
after
writing,
for
the
first
time
I
revised
because
I
knew
a
more
lyrical
word
or
sophisticated
phrasing,
celebrating
each
time
I
read
a
sentence
that
already
satisfied
my
expectations.
For
the
first
time,
I
was
enjoying
reading
a
paper
I
had
written
on
someone
elseOs
orders,
and
for
the
first
time,
I
was
burning
through
better
and
better
revisions
until
my
paper
was
as
interesting
to
me
as
my
homemade
storybooks
once
were.
My
new
motivation
could
not
have
come
at
a
more
fortuitous
time.
Eleventh
grade
was
particularly
reviled
in
my
high
school,
not
just
because
of
college
searches,
SATs,
and
AP
classes,
but
also
because
of
Mrs.
Robinson
and
her
notorious
Honors
English
class.
Beginning
with
my
first
summer
assignment,
an
informal
response
to
AngelaOs
Ashes,
Mrs.
Robinson
left
me
notes
championing
what
she
called
the
NreadabilityO
of
my
style.
The
comments
that
she
wrote
in
the
margins
of
my
drafts
engaged
and
challenged
me,
mostly
because
her
thoughts
and
reservations
about
my
papers
matched
the
concerns
I
had
tasted
in
my
read-throughs.
My
confidence
in
my
writing
skyrocketed
as
Mrs.
RobinsonOs
careful
feedback
boosted
my
confidence
in
my
read-through
as
a
method
of
revision.
The
byproduct
of
my
confidence
was
that,
for
the
first
time
since
my
early
days
with
handmade
picture
books,
I
began
identifying
myself
as
a
writer.
The
scope
and
ambitiousness
of
my
compositions
for
school
began
to
grow,
as
I
sought
to
write
interesting
reading
material,
not
only
in
terms
of
language,
but
in
terms
of
content,
in
terms
of
finding
an
OangleO
that
no
one
else
in
my
class
would
(hopefully)
be
writing
about.
Additionally,
I
started
trusting
myself
to
branch
into
other
genres,
re-tooling
the
long-abandoned
tomes
of
poetry
I
scribbled
and
forgot
in
middle
school,
entering
timed
persuasive
essay
competitions,
and
even
accepting
Mrs.
RobinsonOs
challenge
to
write
my
second-ever
20-plus-page
research
paper
in
the
voice
of
the
author
I
was
researching
(the
razor-witted
humorist
Dorothy
Parker).
Because
of
this
newfound
personal
esteem
for
my
writingNas
well
as
AP
and
SAT
II
testsO
sharpening
of
my
grammarNI
felt
ready
for
college
writing,
which
I
assumed
would
require
approximately
the
same
narrative
skill
as
my
high
school
papers,
but
with
greater
pressure
to
use
proper
in-text
citations.
Either
hubris
or
healthy
confidence
told
me
that
FYS
should
be
a
manageable
transition
into
college
writing.
I
was
a
little
more
wary
about
skipping
College
Writing
in
favor
of
a
200-level
English
course,
but
mainly
I
despaired
of
writing
for
non-English
courses.
My
relatively-newfound
drive
to
make
my
papers
OreadableO
had
put
my
for-English
writing
in
a
revision-centric
place,
where
I
would
brainstorm
a
multilayered
thesis
and
write
my
way
to
the
exact
angle
that
I
wanted
to
focus
on,
going
back
to
fit
this
new
angle
into
the
first
half
of
my
paper.
In
the
science
lab
reports
and
history
research
papers
I
had
written
in
high
school,
I
was
too
busy
trying
to
produce
the
right
answers
or
document
sources
properly
to
define
good,
non-literary
writing.
Thus,
going
into
college,
I
felt
ready
to
tackle
more
advanced
English
writingNwhich
I
could
I
motivate
myself
forN
than
I
did
introductory
non-English
writing.
The
multiple
revisions
I
employed
in
my
writing
for
my
English
classes
resulted
in
polished,
precisely
phrased
drafts
organized
around
a
controlled
thesis.
The
main
value
of
this
drafting
was
that
in
my
earliest
conferences
with
professors
and
reviewers
I
was
able
to
move
past
issues
of
structure,
or
finding
focus,
or
word
choice,
because
I
had
already
made
headway
ironing
these
out
through
my
own
re-writing.
I
remember
in
my
very
first
meeting
with
my
FYS
WA
we
ended
up
discussing
the
OpurposeO
of
every
paragraph,
and
making
sure
that
each
sentence
somehow
fit
into
my
theme,
an
element
that
added
to
the
clarity
of
my
paper,
which
might
never
have
been
discussed
if
I
hadnOt
already
worked
through
other
issues.
Where
I
really
could
have
used
a
WA
was
in
my
introductory
sciences,
where
I
scored
well
on
lab
reports
by
haranguing
lab
assistants
and
professors
to
define
exactly
what
kind
of
writing
the
class
demanded.
Once
I
could
imagine
what
a
proper
lab
report
sounded
like,
I
found
it
no
harder
to
write
them
than
to
write
other
papers,
although
my
lab
groupOs
somewhat
sketchy
results
occasionally
made
the
writing
process
unusually
colorful.
As
usual,
I
found
re-reading
my
work
to
be
the
key;
this
time,
instead
of
reading
for
what
I
instinctively
knew
sounded
best,
I
read
for
what
the
science
genre
considered
best.
It
continued
to
be
my
understanding
of
how
written
words
should
readNin
whatever
genreN
that
signaled
to
me
the
direction
my
own
papers
were
taking.
If
twenty
years
ago,
my
mother
had
decided
not
to
tell
her
baby
daughter
stories,
I
wonder
if
it
would
have
dulled
my
love
of
reading.
Were
I
not
a
passionate
reader,
I
have
no
idea
what
my
writing
would
look
like
today,
because
I
donOt
know
if
I
could
evaluate
it
properly.
Decades
of
reading
literary
texts
have
programmed
me
to
recognize
the
ebb
and
flow
of
literary
writing,
just
as
studying
other
genres
is
teaching
me
to
pin
down
the
ambiguous
rule
of
what
makes
writing
brilliant,
proper,
novel,
or
otherwise
interesting.
In
short,
the
more
I
have
read
my
writing
and
othersO
writing,
the
better
I
have
defined
what
makes
writing
worth
reading.
