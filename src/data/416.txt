I
think
there
is
a
time
in
everyoneus
life
where
one
seeks
refuge
in
a
journal
or
diary.
I
remember
the
time
I
documented
my
first
thoughts
in
a
pretty
little
book
adorned
with
different
cats
and
kittens,
bound
together
by
thick
spirals.
It
was
a
gift
given
to
me
by
my
next
door
neighbor,
an
English
teacher
of
our
public
school
system,
who
said
it
was
a
necessary
tool
for
a
growing
young
girl
to
have
in
order
to
express
her
opinions,
concerns,
and
emotions.
While
I
would
have
much
rather
be
given
a
great
new
outfit,
or
a
gift
certificate
to
Sam
Goody,
there
was
some
sacredness
to
owning
a
diary.
Even
the
word
rdiarys
whispered
rsecretives
and
a
glow
of
mystery
and
privacy
radiated
from
its
cover.
I
opened
the
book
to
inscribe
my
signature
on
the
back
of
the
cover.
With
each
curve
of
my
immature
cursive,
my
name
was
forever
branded
on
a
document
that
contained
all
my
deepest
thoughts.
According
to
my
neighborus
instructions,
every
night
I
wrote
in
my
journal,
which
I
named
rKittys
to
emulate
the
famous
diary
of
Anne
Frank.
I
often
documented
the
course
of
the
day,
instances
which
had
taken
place
at
school
or
soccer,
new
boy
crushes,
best
friends,
time
spent
with
my
little
brother
or
my
parents.
However,
each
entry
written
was
censored
with
the
voice
that
lingered
in
my
head,
rBe
careful
what
you
write.
If
mom
were
to
ever
read
this,
what
would
she
think?s
Intimidated
by
the
consequences,
my
journal
writing
became
more
of
a
documentation
of
day
to
day
activities
then
a
gathering
of
thoughts
and
emotions.
Yet
with
each
passing
day,
I
began
to
trust
the
privacy
of
Kitty
more
and
more
and
the
voice
began
to
subside
from
my
head.
Soon,
I
found
myself
turning
to
Kitty
after
an
argument
with
my
mother
and
scream
to
the
pages
words
of
hatred
and
frustration.
The
words
that
were
written
would
have
never
left
my
mouth
had
I
been
talking
to
someone,
yet
Kitty
made
me
feel
comfortable
enough
to
express
them,
plus,
the
only
person
that
would
ever
read
them,
would
be
me.
As
I
grew
more
mature
with
each
passing
year
of
my
life,
so
did
my
writing.
The
pages
that
once
held
the
innocent
accounts
of
my
childhood
somehow
morphed
into
pages
containing
words
with
much
deeper
meaning
and
much
deeper
secrecy.
I
was
changing
and
so
were
my
opinions,
my
thoughts
and
my
emotions.
As
I
embarked
on
the
awkward
journey
from
adolescence
to
adulthood,
my
life
filled
with
change;
change
both
unwanted,
unknown,
and
desired.
During
this
time
I
suffered
the
loss
of
a
very
close
cousin,
who
took
his
own
life
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
flee
his
drug
addiction.
My
world
crashed
around
me
and
no
one
seemed
to
understand
my
emotions
except
for
Kitty.
I
spend
hours
and
pages
writing
down
my
feelings;
my
anger,
my
sadness,
my
loneliness.
In
attempts
to
blame
others
for
my
cousinus
suicide,
I
condemned
my
own
family
members
with
hurtful
words
that
had
the
power
to
stab
oneus
heart
with
betrayal
and
disloyalty.
The
letters
jumbled
around
in
my
head
to
form
words
that
flowed
from
the
end
of
my
pencil
in
powerful,
scribbled
sentences
that
could
only
be
described
as
raw
emotions.
There
was
no
filter
in
place
to
process
these
crude
thoughts
as
there
was
in
my
formal
writing.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life,
the
filter
had
been
set
aside
and
words
painted
the
pages
with
no
refinement.
In
life,
once
one
is
exposed
to
a
change,
it
is
often
difficult
to
return
to
life
as
it
was.
For
example,
if
a
man
slaved
over
math
calculations
on
pen
and
paper
and
is
then
exposed
to
a
calculator
to
do
such
work
for
him,
it
is
almost
certain
he
would
continue
with
a
calculator
to
compute
his
math
instead
of
wasting
time
using
a
pen
and
paper,
unless
directed
otherwise.
A
similar
concept
had
occurred
with
my
writing.
Once
the
filter
that
processed
my
thoughts
from
informal
to
formal
was
removed,
it
opened
a
new
door
of
writing
for
me.
When
writing
for
school,
the
filter
was
instinctively
back
in
place
as
if
my
mind
knew
its
audience.
When
the
audience
was
reduced
to
my
own
self,
the
filter
magically
disappeared
from
my
head
again.
Words
that
took
time
and
effort
to
process
for
school
now
flowed
out
from
my
head
like
a
waterfall
into
a
lagoon
that
became
my
diary.
Without
the
mechanism
to
sift
my
emotions
into
structured
and
appropriate
sentences,
my
diary
became
a
very
vital
outlet
in
my
life.
Growing
exponentially
with
the
changes
of
High
School,
my
writing
became
complex;
asking
questions,
reflecting
on
dreams,
and
documenting
first
experiences.
My
questions
were
not
simple,
my
dreams
werenut
very
attainable,
and
my
experiences
were
not
always
appropriate.
I
questioned
my
parents
love
for
each
other
and
the
reality
of
their
relationship
behind
the
scenes
after
watching
relationships
in
school
prosper
and
relationship
of
friendsu
parents
deteriorate.
I
wrote
of
my
dreams
to
model
and
my
pages
became
collages
of
magazine
cut-outs.
Mingled
between
the
pretty
faces
and
thin
bodies
were
the
words
that
reflected
my
first
issues
with
body
weight
and
image.
Soon
amidst
those
pages,
words
of
sexual
desire
and
experience
with
my
new
boyfriend
began
to
fill
each
line.
Graphic
details
and
utter
emotions
that
were
only
known
to
him
and
I
were
now
transmitted
on
paper,
the
lead
of
the
pencil
forever
engraining
its
significance.
However
it
had
all
changed
in
a
matter
of
minutes.
I
had
gone
to
bed
early
that
night
and
fell
asleep
with
my
cat,
Misty,
at
my
side.
I
must
have
been
in
bed
for
hours
when
I
quietly
awoke
and
saw
the
outline
of
a
human
body
slither
through
the
cracked
door
and
over
to
my
desk
drawer.
Misty
had
awoken
too
and
perked
this
head
up
facing
the
intruder.
Incoherent,
confused,
and
half-awake,
I
watched
in
silence
as
the
figure
opened
my
desk
drawer
and
took
out
a
book-like
object.
Seconds
later,
it
vanished
back
through
the
door
opening,
and
I
was
left
alone
in
silence
and
darkness.
I
once
again
closed
my
eyes,
convinced
I
was
apart
a
dream.
From
what
seemed
to
be
an
unconscious
slumber,
seconds
later,
I
suddenly
awoke
with
a
knot
tied
tight
in
my
stomach.
Perhaps
I
was
not
dreaming.
Immediately,
I
sat
up,
rushed
out
of
bed
over
to
my
desk
drawer.
My
diary
was
missing.
I
stood
staring
at
its
empty
place
in
my
desk
and
felt
as
if
I
were
stripped
off
all
privacy,
security,
and
confidence.
I
ran
into
my
motherus
room
and
before
I
could
say
a
word,
there
was
my
mother
sitting
on
the
edge
of
her
bed,
my
personal
life
sprawled
out
in
front
of
her.
I
never
again
wrote
in
Kitty.
The
words
on
the
pages
that
were
only
written
for
my
personal
reflection
and
were
never
meant
for
public
viewing,
had
pierced
my
motherus
heart
in
ways
I
had
never
intended.
rThey
are
just
words,s
I
tried
to
explain,
confused
with
having
to
justify
my
private
thoughts.
My
mind
was
distorted.
The
insurmountable
guilt
in
knowing
my
mother
had
read
hateful
words
directed
towards
her
and
the
rest
of
the
family,
the
embarrassment
of
my
sexual
experiences,
but
also
the
anger
of
her
betrayal.
rI
thought
we
had
a
good
relationship
where
you
could
tell
me
these
things,s
my
mother
replied
as
tears
began
to
gather
in
her
eyes.
rI
thought
we
had
a
good
relationship
where
you
respected
my
privacy,s
I
retorted
back
sharply.
And
right
there,
the
conversation
ceased,
she
handed
me
back
my
diary
with
a
simple,
rIum
sorry,s
and
left
the
room.
Somberly,
I
walked
back
to
my
own
room,
wrapped
masking
tape
around
my
journal
and
tucked
it
deep
inside
my
desk
drawer,
never
to
be
used
again.
During
this
time
when
Kitty
had
become
one
of
my
major
confidents,
literacy
no
longer
was
a
language
of
education;
it
became
a
personal
way
to
express
myself.
My
diary
was
filled
with
so
many
secretive
emotions
and
thoughts
that
documented
my
personal
growth
as
a
woman
throughout
my
adolescence.
It
was
the
internal
side
no
one
else
could
see.
While
these
words
explained
my
emotional
status
of
the
time,
they
could
not
be
forgotten
with
each
passing
year,
like
stories
told
to
friends
or
arguments
between
family
members
that
would
fade
away
over
time.
The
words
written
on
paper
in
my
journal
were
there
forever.
Despite
the
fact
the
emotions
that
were
transcribed
on
paper
were
there
for
good,
they
all
seem
to
be
stripped
from
my
soul
when
read
by
a
foreign
reader.
Not
only
had
my
motherus
viewing
of
Kitty
intruded
on
my
privacy,
but
because
Kitty
became
a
literal
representation
of
my
interior,
her
intrusion
became
an
evasion
of
me
as
well.
It
was
at
that
point
in
my
life
where
I
realized
the
filter
that
I
once
set
aside
needed
to
be
put
back
in
place.
It
wouldnut
be
until
my
freshman
year
in
college
where
I
forced
my
mind
to,
once
again,
omit
the
filter
and
let
the
words
and
ideas
flow
freely
from
brain
onto
paper.
College
was
a
very
pivotal
time
in
my
life,
both
socially
and
academically.
I
grew
a
great
deal
in
my
first
year
of
college
and
so
did
my
writing.
Looking
back
on
my
academic
literacy
through
the
years,
I
rode
a
roller
coaster
up
and
down
throughout
my
education
in
English.
The
cart
would
crank
me
up
to
its
highest
points
when
writing
creatively
or
in
my
journal.
I
always
enjoyed
writing
stories
of
far
away
places
with
princes
and
dragons
in
my
elementary
classes
and
even
a
stellar
murder
mystery
that
received
much
recognition
during
Junior
High.
However,
the
cart
would
often
drop
during
the
High
School
English
classes
that
were
limited
to
analysis,
character
development,
and
hidden
meaning
of
the
assigned
books.
The
difference
between
the
rhighsus
and
the
rlowsus,
I
had
realized,
was
the
abundance
of
emotion
behind
the
piece
or
the
lack
thereof.
As
a
result,
English
sometimes
dropped
from
being
my
favorite
to
least
favorite
class.
The
time
set
aside
to
writing
in
my
journal
was
replaced.
I
had
lost
my
desire
to
write
for
it
was
so
tainted
by
all
the
rules
and
regulations
of
High
School
standards.
The
filter
had
seemed
to
be
set
permanently
in
place,
forbidding
anything
real
or
exciting
to
seep
through.
I
stopped
caring
about
the
subject
simply
because
I
didnut
want
to
write
about
things
that
didnut
interest
or
excite
me.
There
was
no
emotion
behind
the
words
and
with
the
lack
of
emotion
came
the
lack
of
interest.
In
the
second
semester
of
my
freshman
year,
I
was
enrolled
in
an
English
course
that
pushed
these
limits.
It
was
unlike
a
class
Iud
ever
been
apart
of.
Contrary
to
many
academic
standards,
it
was
required
of
this
class
to
write
five
days
a
week,
every
week.
What
we
were
to
write,
was
left
mostly
to
us,
save
a
rough
outline
of
points
to
cover
given
by
the
professor.
Before
I
knew
it,
I
was
consumed
with
my
assignments.
Not
only
was
I
writing
for
my
teacher
and
my
peers,
I
was
writing
for
myself.
Little
by
little,
my
academic
filter
shrank
with
each
piece
I
wrote.
I
was
writing
about
everything;
my
childhood,
my
friends,
my
family,
politics,
and
all
the
feelings
and
emotions
that
were
attached
to
each.
It
was
during
this
time
when
I
realized
how
much
I
loved
to
write
and
how
much
my
writing
had
improved.
I
wanted
to
be
involved
with
it
not
only
in
the
classroom.
I
purchased
a
new
journal
and
transcribed
more
personal
thoughts
and
reactions.
I
received
a
job
as
a
Writing
Associate
in
an
attempt
to
pass
along
help
to
other
students
and
to
also
learn
a
great
deal
from
their
own
work.
I
will
enroll
in
the
college
newspaper
to
gain
a
journalistic
perspective
as
well.
I
research
major
journalistic
or
publishing
institutions
to
attend
for
internship
programs.
I
read
religiously,
memorizing
interesting
vocabulary
and
noticing
different
writing
styles.
All
of
these
factors
contributed
to
the
deterioration
of
the
strict
filter
that
was
once
set
for
my
academic
works.
The
passion
for
writing
that
was
once
displayed
in
my
diary
Kitty,
was
set
to
rest
through
classes
in
High
School,
and
then
brought
back
to
life
at
Lafayette.
The
simple
idea
of
linking
everyday
instances
to
uninteresting
book
analysis
made
writing
intriguing
and
exciting.
I
had
found
a
way
to
take
the
raw
emotions
that
seemed
so
confusing
back
in
my
adolescence
and
weave
them
through
mature
and
polished
sentences
fit
for
school.
Living
without
a
structural
filter,
not
only
eliminated
the
dullness
of
typical
academic
writing
but
it
made
me
want
to
live
my
life
to
the
fullest
just
so
I
can
eventually
write
about
it.
