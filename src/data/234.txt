WA
Writing
Assignment
August
27,
1999
As
I
embark
upon
my
mission
as
a
Writing
Associate
for
the
second
year
in
a
row,
I
suppose
it
is
fitting,
(as
well
as
an
inevitable
part
of
my
assignment),
to
reflect
upon
what
this
last
year
as
a
WA
has
meant
to
me
as
a
writer.
While
this
has
been
one
of
the
most
formative
years
for
my
writing,
I
have
realized
that
there
is
a
very
fine
line
between
my
role
as
a
Writing
Associate
and
my
role
as
a
writer.
Initially,
the
whole
idea
that
I
was
a
WA
made
me
more
perceptive
when
it
came
to
critically
examining
a
piece
of
writing,
but
as
time
went
on,
writing
and
WA-ing
became
an
almost
simultaneous
employment.
Every
piece
of
writing
that
I
encounter,
whether
it
is
my
own
or
another's
is
automatically
analyzed,
and
every
paper
that
I
write
starts
off
with
the
same
question
I
begin
my
WA
appointments
with,
What
argument
or
idea
are
you
trying
to
get
across
to
your
audience?
This
intertwinement
of
WA-ing
and
writing
has
enabled
me
to
grow
and
develop
as
writer
and
has
prepared
me
to
confront
new
types
of
writing
with
a
confidence
in
what
I
have
learned.
As
a
new
Writing
Associate,
I
had
the
dubious
honor
of
having
Professor
Seetch's
First
Year
Seminar
as
the
class
I
would
work
with
for
the
semester.
I
must
admit,
as
a
fledgling
WA,
I
was
terribly
nervous
about
being
a
Writing
Associate
for
a
member
of
the
higher
echelon
of
the
College
Writing
Program.
I
was
wracked
with
doubts
as
to
whether
I
would
indeed
be
a
good,
capable,
WA
or
if
I
would
forget
all
I
ever
knew
about
writing
and
lead
a
new,
young
crop
of
freshman
astray.
I
mean,
Professor
Seetch
is
in
charge
when
it
comes
to
the
College
Writing
Program;
she
would
surely
have
stringent
guidelines
of
what
a
WA
had
to
do.
If
I
messed
up,
what
would
happen?
As
luck
would
have
it,
WA-ing
for
Professor
Seetch's
class
turned
out
to
be
a
positive
and
very
educational
experience.
From
the
beginning,
I
was
able
to
discuss
all
the
details
of
the
FYS
and
the
assignments
with
her,
and
she
always
provided
me
with,
not
only
extra
information
on
the
class,
but
also
very
detailed
assignments
outlining
exactly
what
she
wanted
the
students
to
produce.
Besides
helping
me
when
it
came
to
appointments
with
the
students,
these
assignment
outlines
helped
me
with
my
own
writing.
In
the
WA
student
meetings,
I
had
a
virtual
checklist
of
the
problems
and
questions
Professor
Seetch
wanted
her
students
to
probe,
and
if
something
was
missing,
we
could
go
back
and
discuss
a
way
to
incorporate
into
the
paper.
These
assignments
also
aided
me
in
working
with
the
students
on
the
idea
of
a
thesis,
which
I
found
to
be
the
biggest
problem
for
students
in
my
year
as
a
WA.
When
the
assignments
were
stated
in
this
clear
manner,
as
well
as
the
supporting
ideas
that
the
professor
wanted
included,
I
was
able
to
help
the
students
focus
their
papers
around
a
central
idea
or
argument
to
ultimately
write
a
cohesive,
well-executed
paper.
Even
further
than
allowing
me
to
have
more
productive
sessions
with
the
students,
these
assignment
packets
that
Professor
Seetch
provided
helped
me
with
my
own
writing.
I
had
available
to
me
the
kinds
of
questions
I
should
be
asking
myself
when
I
write
a
paper
and
the
amount
of
support
a
professor
would
expect
from
me
when
I
am
defending
an
argument.
Because
of
these
meetings
with
and
assignments
from
Professor
Seetch,
I
began
to
really
identify
the
global
concerns
in
the
students'
papers
as
well
as
in
my
own
writing.
When
I
returned
to
school
on
January
after
a
full
semester
of
WA-ing
under
my
belt,
I
felt
much
more
at
ease
taking
on
my
VAST
class
with
Professor
Lennertz.
This
class,
however,
proved
to
be
a
challenge,
but
nonetheless
was
beneficial
to
my
experience
as
a
WA
and
a
writer.
The
subject
matter
in
this
particular
class
was
very
different
than
what
I
encountered
in
the
poetry-based
FYS
from
the
previous
semester.
Professor
Lennertz's
VAST
was
concerned
with
many
of
the
legal
implications
surrounding
policy
on
the
protection
of
water.
This
was
an
area
in
which
I
had
relatively
little
knowledge
so
it
was
very
important
that
I
conversed
with
Professor
Lennertz
about
exactly
what
the
paper
topic
was
and
exactly
what
he
wanted
his
students
to
compose.
Like
Professor
Seetch,
he
provided
me
with
very
detailed
explanations
of
what
types
of
questions
the
students'
papers
should
answer,
but
he
took
supporting
an
argument
to
a
new
level,
and
this
is
something
that
has
greatly
benefited
my
writing.
In
these
papers
discussing
legal
matters,
Professor
Lennertz
urged
his
students
not
to
leave
any
loopholes
in
their
theses.
As
a
WA
for
this
class,
I
had
to
become
an
extremely
critical
reader,
looking
for
weaknesses
in
their
arguments
and
statements
that
did
not
uphold
nor
had
no
relevance
to
their
thesis.
Once
I
got
into
the
mode
of
critically
looking
at
the
global
concerns
in
the
papers,
I
also
became
more
adept
at
the
locating
the
local
concerns.
While
I
may
have
become
a
picky
and
questioning
WA,
the
concerns
I
bring
up
in
the
students'
papers
are
the
same
ones
I
look
for
when
writing
my
own
papers.
This
idea
of
asking
difficult
questions
about
the
cohesiveness
of
your
own
paper
has
been
a
skill
I
am
glad
to
have
developed.
The
two
semesters
of
WA-ing
have
provided
me
with
the
knowledge
of
what
questions
to
ask
myself
about
my
paper
and
of
how
important
a
strong
thesis
is
in
tightly
binding
your
ideas
together.
Experiencing
this
past
year
as
a
Writing
Associate
has
prepared
me
for
the
new
types
of
writings
that
I
encountered
in
the
second
semester.
The
way
I
learned
to
question
and
critique
writing
was
especially
helpful
in
my
VAST
class,
Science,
Anti-Science,
Pseudoscience,
and
Nonsense
,
because
the
entire
course
was
based
around
analyzing
the
efficacy
of
scientific
claims.
The
first
paper
in
this
class
was
to
take
an
article
from
a
tabloid
and
question
the
author's
claims,
an
exercise
that
had
many
similarities
to
WA-ing
papers.
My
choice
in
articles
was
entitled
The
Pee-Pee
Psychic
,
and
I
had
to
assess
whether
the
said
clairvoyant
did
indeed
have
the
ability
to
predict
the
future
via
a
urine
sample.
Now
I
obviously
thought
that
this
article
had
no
merit
whatsoever,
but
the
assignment
was
to
pick
apart
the
article
and
show
where
and
how
the
author
could
have
provided
evidence
to
support
that
this
psychic
phenomenon
had
some
viability.
In
essence,
I
was
looking
for
ways
to
dissect
the
thesis
and
see
if
the
paper
could
substantiate
its
claim.
The
article
pretty
much
failed
to
lend
any
credence
to
the
Pee-Pee
Psychic,
but
at
least
Professor
Barber
had
a
chuckle.
While
this
was
a
fairly
easy
article
to
scrutinize,
the
task
got
harder
when
we
had
to
do
the
same
thing
to
an
article
that
was
on
a
much
less
ludicrous
subject.
The
next
topic
was
acupuncture,
and
this
is
a
potentially
viable
medical
treatment,
so
the
questions
had
to
be
more
probing.
Moving
from
the
first
assignment
to
the
second
assignment
was
like
WA-ing
from
the
first
to
the
second
semester.
Professor
Seetch
wanted
a
strong
thesis
with
all
your
questions
answered,
but
Professor
Lennertz
wanted
everything
questioned
and
no
loopholes
in
your
argument.
When
analyzing
the
articles
on
acupuncture,
I
had
to
look
for
every
loophole
and
show
where
there
was
not
enough
evidence
to
say
that
acupuncture
is
indeed
a
viable
treatment.
Professor
Lennertz's
stringent
requirements
helped
with
my
own
VAST,
but
as
I
got
more
practice
at
this
litany
of
questioning
in
my
own
writing,
I
was
better
able
to
advise
the
students.
This
is
when
I
truly
realized
that
WA-ing
and
writing
a
virtually
one
in
the
same
in
terms
of
the
process
I
undertake
for
both.
The
final
area
where
I
saw
how
WA-ing
aided
me
as
a
writer
was
when
I
had
to
compose
my
speech
for
the
Tech
Clinic
presentation,
and
the
notion
of
audience
truly
took
hold.
By
WA-ing
for
two
very
different
classes,
I
began
to
understand
what
writing
for
an
audience
meant,
and
this
was
a
great
help
when
it
came
time
for
the
presentation.
In
Professor
Seetch's
class,
the
audience
was
always
herself,
the
students,
and
poetry
circles,
so
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
creativity
allowed
when
the
students
wrote
about
their
interpretations
of
the
poems.
In
Professor
Lennertz's
class
however,
the
audience
was
himself;
sometimes
an
imaginary
government
panel,
a
group
of
Supreme
Court
justices,
or
policy
makers;
and
even
an
expert
in
whatever
discipline
the
student
was
majoring
in.
Going
from
paper
to
paper,
I
could
easily
see
the
shift
in
audience,
and
this
ensuing
consciousness
of
the
audience
you're
writing
for
is
a
skill
I
am
glad
to
have
acquired.
In
writing
my
Tech
Clinic
presentation,
I
was
very
aware
that
I
had
to
draft
a
speech
that
reached
out
to
members
of
the
Easton
Heritage
Alliance,
possible
monetary
donors,
and
members
of
the
community.
This
would
have
been
a
very
daunting
task
had
I
not
been
exposed
to
the
idea
of
audience
through
my
WA-ing.
It
has
become
very
evident
to
me
that
writing
and
WA-ing
benefit
each
other.
As
I
become
more
adept
at
one
occupation,
I
in
turn,
aid
the
other.
This
is
why
I
see
WA-ing
and
writing
as
ultimately
the
same,
and
my
experience
in
these
areas
this
year,
has
been
overall
very
formative
and
helped
me
greatly
to
improve
the
papers
I
produce.
