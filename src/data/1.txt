about
my
Words
I've
been
writing
words
for
almost
15
years
now,
but
I
had
never
had
to
write
about
writing.
It
sounds
like
a
philosophical
task
and
I
am
sure
that
by
the
time
I
will
write
the
ending
paragraph
I
will
have
learned
a
lot
about
myself
and
about
the
process
of
writing.
Writing
about
oneself
should
be
an
easy
task,
but
writing
about
oneself
such
that
it
is
interesting
and
useful
for
others
is
bigger
challenge.
So,
let's
see
if
I
am
up
to
the
challenge.
The
Early
Stages
The
first
letters
Writing
cannot
be
created
unless
you
know
what
you
write
with.
My
writing
road
started
with
letters
A
and
M
in
the
first
weeks
of
elementary
school.
I
could
write
MAMA
and
recognize
it
in
other's
writing.
I
remember
being
so
proud
when
I
learned
new
letters
that
I
could
not
wait
to
go
home
and
let
my
parents
and
grandparents
know
about
the
greatest
accomplishments
I
have
had
at
school
that
day.
New
letters
every
day,
new
mysteries
uncovered,
a
whole
new
world
opened
in
front
of
my
eyes.
I
could
recognize
letters
and
write
them
on
paper.
In
addition
to
the
homework
we
got
every
day,
I
remember
scribbling
every
chance
I
got
the
few
letters
I
knew.
I
started
decorating
my
room,
my
objects
and
even
my
clothes
and
my
dolls'
clothes
with
letters.
The
new
world
was
fascinating
and
learning
to
master
it
was
an
exciting
activity.
The
importance
of
writing
with
a
pen
One
moment
that
marked
every
Romanian
child's
experience
is
gaining
the
ability
and
the
permission
to
write
with
a
fountain
pen.
You
first
learn
to
write
with
a
pencil
because
you
need
to
erase
what
went
wrong
and
correct
it.
But
when
you
get
permission
from
the
teacher
to
use
a
fountain
pen
means
that
you
have
reached
whole
other
level.
It
means
you
have
gained
some
mastery
in
the
arts
of
calligraphy.
It
means
that
you
don't
make
mistakes
as
often
as
the
beginners.
Permission
to
write
with
a
fountain
pen
is
like
gaining
access
to
a
select
club.
And
yes,
I
am
not
a
native
English
speaker.
I
learned
to
write
in
Romanian.
Fortunately
for
me,
the
language
uses
the
same
char
set
and
that
made
it
easier
to
learn
to
write
in
English.
Romanian
is
a
romantic
language
which
evolved
from
the
mix
of
Latin
with
the
original
language
of
the
natives
of
Romania.
It
has
absorbed
over
the
years
influences
from
the
Slavic
and
Hungarian
languages,
but
at
the
grammatical
basis
it
is
a
romantic
language.
The
first
letter
to
my
grandparents
The
next
big
level
in
writing
was
the
first
letter
to
the
grandparents.
We
wrote
it
at
school
as
soon
as
we
mastered
almost
all
the
important
letters
in
the
alphabet.
It
took
us
an
entire
school
day
to
write
it
and
a
few
days
to
plan
it.
I
remember
that
the
day
after
we
wrote
it,
we
had
a
school
trip
to
the
post
office
to
mail
the
letter
to
our
grandparents.
Although
it
was
just
a
few
sentences
on
a
white
piece
of
paper
it
meant
so
much
to
us
that
we
could
communicate
in
writing
with
other
people,
that
I
can
remember
the
moments
vividly
in
my
mind.
From
here
on,
the
adventures
of
writing
started
to
become
more
of
a
routine
than
extraordinary
events.
We
were
asked
to
write
at
least
a
few
sentences
every
day.
We
learned
to
answer
questions
about
texts,
we
learned
to
write
summaries
for
readings,
we
learned
to
write
creative
stories
about
imaginary
figures,
we
learned
to
write
descriptions
about
nature
and
events
and
finally
we
learned
to
comment
on
the
readings
assigned.
We
learned
everything
in
elementary
school,
but
it
wasn't
refined.
We
needed
to
gain
experience,
we
needed
to
polish
our
skills,
to
learn
specific
vocabulary
and
terminology,
to
learn
techniques
for
better
writing,
but
we
knew
the
essence.
We
knew
that
the
process
of
writing
starts
with
a
task,
a
prompt,
an
idea
and
then
develops
into
a
plan
or
an
outline
after
which
the
writer
needs
to
turn
it
into
words
that
are
organized
in
paragraphs.
The
philosophy
of
writing
is
not
that
complicated;
anyone
can
write,
but
not
everyone
can
write
well.
That
is
what
I
needed
to
learn
and
so
I
went
to
middle
school.
The
Middle
Stages
I
can
only
remember
two
events
vividly
from
my
middle
school
experience
with
writing.
It
is
not
because
I
didn't
do
much
writing,
but
because
I
started
to
become
used
to
it.
There
is
one
issue
with
writing
education
in
middle
school
that
I
see
now
after
years
of
experience:
we
were
expected
to
know
how
to
write,
but
professors
would
not
teach
anything
about
the
logistics
of
writing.
Students
who
did
well
in
literature
classes
with
intensive
writing
assignments
were
those
who
had
an
innate
feeling
about
the
writing
process
and
who
could
understand
on
their
own
what
made
text
worth
reading.
I
have
never
thought
of
myself
as
being
one
of
them,
but
my
literature
professor
sent
me
to
the
county
level
of
the
National
Contest
for
Romanian
Language
and
Literature.
6th
grade
Literature
Contest
creativity
selfcensored
The
contest
was
a
three
hour
written
exam
that
took
the
students
through
literary
analysis,
grammatical
analysis
and
then
essay
writing.
For
the
particular
one
I
have
taken
part
in,
we
had
to
write
a
creative
essay
on
a
given
theme.
I
honestly
don't
remember
the
theme
now,
but
I
remember
what
I
have
done
with
my
essay.
I
started
writing
the
essay
first
thing
after
I
got
the
exam
paper.
I
was
so
excited
about
the
theme
and
creativity
was
flowing
out
of
my
brain
onto
the
paper
like
I
was
a
professional
writer.
I
created
a
fantasy
short
story
with
animals
that
had
strange
human
capabilities
and
explored
the
theme
into
great
depths.
In
just
an
hour
I
was
done
with
the
essay
although
I
was
recommended
to
take
at
least
half
the
exam
time
for
the
essay
because
it
was
worth
60%
of
the
grade.
And
then
I
went
on
to
complete
the
literature
and
grammar
questions.
After
I
was
done
with
everything
the
censorship
arrived.
I
read
the
essay
again
and
I
was
disappointed.
I
didn't
like
it
anymore.
I
thought
my
ideas
were
too
childish
for
6th
grade.
Talking
about
animals
with
super
powers
seemed
like
kindergarten
stories.
So
I
read
it
again
and
decided
I
could
not
hand
in
this
essay.
I
crossed
out
all
the
four
pages
of
the
hand-written
essay
and
started
a
new,
more
serious
essay
that
I
obviously
could
not
finish
in
time
to
hand
in.
But
I
thought
I'd
better
present
myself
with
a
serious
grown-up
story
that
is
not
finished
than
with
a
children
story
that
would
either
amuse
the
graders
or
bore
them
to
death.
I
was
confident
and
happy
with
my
decision,
until
my
literature
professor
called
me
the
next
Monday
to
talk
after
class.
She
scolded
me
for
crossing
out
my
first
essay.
Everybody
from
the
grading
center
loved
it.
They
admired
my
creativity
and
wit,
but
could
not
give
me
the
credit
because
according
to
the
rules,
I
did
not
submit
the
essay
for
grading.
I
did
not
get
as
bad
of
a
grade
as
I
deserved
on
the
test
just
because
they
liked
the
crossed
out
essay,
but
I
did
not
go
either
to
the
next
level
of
the
competition.
I
didn't
understand
at
that
point
what
had
just
happened
with
me
and
I
lost
my
confidence
in
writing.
Even
after
talking
to
my
professor
I
didn't
think
the
first
essay
was
worth
reading.
I
still
though
my
decision
was
good
and
I
did
not
have
confidence
that
I
was
cut
for
writing.
That
was
the
end
of
my
literature
contest
career.
Literature
Analysis
Writing
The
other
major
feature
of
the
middle
school
writing
assignments
that
I
remember
is
writing
literature
commentaries.
Don't
imagine
that
all
the
ideas
were
our
own
work.
We
read
what
other
people
have
commented
upon
the
literary
pieces
and
then
took
from
them
what
we
wanted
and
wrote
our
essays.
Nobody
told
us
then
that
it
was
plagiarism
to
take
someone
else's
ideas
and
not
give
them
credit.
What
is
even
sadder
is
that
I
don't
think
that
even
now
does
anybody
tell
the
students
what
proper
quotation
and
paraphrasing
is.
I
personally
know,
but
there
are
many
students
from
Romania
who
still
copy
and
paste
information
into
their
writing
and
don't
give
proper
credit.
Sometimes
they
know
that
what
they
are
doing
is
not
right,
but
in
many
cases
they
think
it
is
legitimate.
Although
I
didn't
learn
about
proper
quotation
from
these
tasks
I
learned
some
other
important
things.
I
learned
to
synthesize:
to
look
at
different
opinions
and
incorporate
them
into
one
short
paper.
Along
with
this,
I
learned
the
terminology
used
by
literary
critics
and
I
could
compose
an
intelligent
couple
of
paragraphs
on
exams
about
simple
literary
pieces.
At
that
point
I
did
not
like
this
kind
of
tasks,
but
I
realize
now
that
they
have
formed
me
into
to
the
writer
I
am
right
now.
At
the
end
of
middle
school,
I
wasn't
even
close
to
the
knowledge
I
have
right
now
about
writing.
High
School
was
probably
the
period
with
the
first
great
accomplishments
in
terms
of
real
academic
writing.
High
School
Writing
High
School
courses
and
interactions
that
I
took
part
in
brought
my
experience
with
writing
to
another
level
of
understanding
and
mastery.
During
this
period
I
started
to
learn
how
to
write
competently
in
English.
Writing
in
English
and
10th
grade
Peace
Corps
volunteer
Tenth
grade
brought
with
it
a
great
challenge.
Our
school
received
a
Peace
Corps
volunteer
who
would
teach
English
for
an
hour
per
week.
Students
were
split
in
groups
of
12
to
15
students
and
each
group
would
have
a
weekly
meeting
with
this
professor.
We
had
a
weekly
reading
out
of
a
collection
of
texts
he
put
together
and
we
would
discuss
it
during
class.
Twice
a
semester
we
also
had
to
write
a
longer
paper.
When
I
look
back
now,
it
wasn't
all
that
long.
The
requirement
was
1500
words
about
a
topic
he
assigned.
The
submission,
review,
and
rewriting
process
that
he
set
up
for
the
class
was
really
revolutionary
for
a
Romanian
high-school.
Romanian
English
teachers
did
not
entirely
understand
why
was
he
going
through
so
much
trouble
reading,
correcting
and
re-reading
papers
from
his
students.
After
going
through
3
years
of
college,
I
understand
the
value
of
what
he
has
done
for
us.
It
was
my
first
contact
with
the
rigorous
American
style
for
teaching
great
communication
skills.
Romanian
teachers
did
not
understand
his
efforts
and
students
did
not
appreciate
it,
but
he
has
tought
us
writing
in
the
3
years
he
spent
with
us
more
than
all
teachers
and
professors
have
tought
us
in
12
years
of
school
from
the
start
of
elementary
to
the
end
of
high-school.
Writing
for
this
class
was
challenging
also
because
we
had
to
write
in
another
language.
Writing
it
in
Romanian
and
then
translating
it
was
an
even
more
difficult
endeavor
than
writing
directly
in
English.
This
course
has
forced
us
in
a
way
to
think
in
English,
to
try
to
formulate
ideas
directly
in
English
and
to
find
the
appropriate
vocabulary
and
grammatical
structures
to
express
the
ideas
we
wanted.
I
remember
everyone
hated
his
assignments
because
they
weren't
easy.
We
had
to
make
a
greater
effort
than
for
other
classes.
What
we
did
not
realise
was
that
with
the
effort
came
understanding
and
building
up
the
skills
for
succes.
After
this
experience
I
started
to
be
afraid
of
writing
assigments,
especially
in
English.
I
would
procrastinate
writing
them
until
the
last
moment.
This
was
even
worse
because
the
feeling
was
aggravated
with
every
day
I
spent
not
completing
an
assignment
for
which
I
knew
that
the
deadline
was
approaching.
This
did
not
help
me
at
all
to
develop
my
writing
skills.
Every
time
we
had
a
new
assignment
I
would
procrastinate
it
until
the
last
day
and
then
write
a
poor
quality
paper.
Not
only
did
I
feel
frightened
before
writing
the
paper
but
I
was
also
feeling
bad
after
completing
an
assignment
for
which
I
did
not
give
the
best
out
of
me.
It
took
a
lot
of
runs
through
the
same
process
until
I
realised
what
I
had
to
do
in
order
to
increase
my
confort
with
writing
and
to
hone
my
skills.
The
College
Application
Essays
The
moment
arrived
when
I
had
to
write
my
college
application
essays.
I
received
the
counseling
of
this
Peace
Corp
Volunteer
and
he
helped
me
put
together
a
schedule
spread
on
multiple
months
with
deadlines
for
drafts
every
week
so
that
I
could
go
through
some
serious
revisions
before
I
was
ready
to
submit
my
essays.
With
every
draft
he
tried
to
correct
my
spelling,
my
word
choice,
my
conciseness,
my
focus
and
my
structure.
With
every
new
draft
of
the
papers
I
was
working
on
for
college
applications,
I
learned
new
things
about
the
process
of
writing,
about
using
my
skills
efficiently
and
basically
about
becoming
a
better
and
more
efficient
writer.
He
managed
to
make
me
bring
out
the
creativity
in
my
essays
and
shape
it
towards
achieving
the
goals
of
the
essays.
By
the
end
of
the
application
period
I
knew
how
to
go
through
the
process
of
writing
on
my
own,
but
I
wasn't
confident
enough
on
my
writing
skills.
I
was
still
a
little
bit
afraid
of
any
task
that
I
was
assigned
and
involved
writing.
Looking
at
where
I
have
started
high-school
and
where
I
ended
in
terms
of
writing
abilities,
I
can
definitely
say
that
I
grew
a
lot,
I
learned
writing
in
another
language,
I
learned
the
mechanics
of
writing
and
editing,
I
learned
to
plan
ahead
my
time
for
a
writing
assignment,
I
learned
to
manage
my
fear
of
writing.
But
yet,
I
wasn't
confident
enough
to
be
able
to
tackle
any
kind
of
writing.
This
is
just
one
of
the
many
reasons
I
needed
to
go
to
college
and
why
I
chose
to
attend
a
university
in
America.
I
can
say
with
confidence
that
any
other
university
I
could
have
attended
in
Europe,
would
not
have
helped
me
as
the
education
at
Lafayette
in
terms
of
developing
communication
skills.
Writing
in
College
Although
I
knew
I
signed
up
for
a
lot
of
writing,
I
looked
forward
to
the
college
experience.
I
had
confidence
in
the
knowledge
and
skills
of
the
professors
who
would
be
teaching
me
how
to
write
and
communicate
professionally.
First
Year
Seminar
and
College
Writing
The
writing
courses
I
had
to
take
during
the
first
year
in
college
not
only
helped
me
explore
subjects
that
broadened
my
horizon
of
knowledge,
they
also
challenged
me
to
write
more,
write
better,
write
more
efficiently.
Combining
the
curiosity
about
the
topic
with
the
writing
tasks
was
an
excellent
way
to
train
our
writing
skills.
The
volume
of
the
writing
assignments
suffered
a
tremendous
jump
from
high-school,
but
it
wasn't
even
at
the
same
level
at
which
I
had
to
write
in
the
past
two
years
of
college.
My
writing
was
also
improved
during
the
first
year
of
college
in
America
because
of
my
improvements
in
speaking
abilities.
Reaching
the
level
of
fluency
in
a
language
that
is
not
native
to
you
means
that
you
have
completely
mastered
the
thinking
process
in
that
language.
Not
only
did
it
help
me
write
better,
but
it
also
boosted
my
confidence
in
the
English
skills
I
had.
Being
asked
to
read
and
to
speak
every
day
in
English
helped
me
master
the
English
grammar,
improved
my
vocabulary
and
made
it
easier
to
express
myself
in
writing.
A
vivid
memory
is
how
one
of
my
writing
professors
would
ask
us
to
have
paragraphs
that
were
no
longer
than
5
sentences
without
loosing
track
of
ideas
and
continuity.
Although
this
seemed
to
me
a
little
bit
rigid
way
to
teach
conciseness
it
had
the
expected
effect
on
my
writing.
When
I
write
now,
I
always
pay
attention
to
both
the
length
of
the
sentence
and
the
length
of
the
paragraph.
Another
really
useful
exercise
that
I
had
to
accomplish
during
writing
classes
at
Lafayette
was
reading
and
providing
feedback
to
my
peers.
This
not
only
provided
a
way
for
me
to
assess
my
writing
against
my
peers,
but
also
helped
to
raise
my
confidence
in
my
writing
skills.
Reading
other
people's
writing
made
me
realise
when
the
writing
was
not
clear,
when
a
better
word
choice
was
needed
or
when
more
organisation
could
improve
the
writing.
By
spotting
the
mistakes
in
other's
writing,
I
was
able
to
understand
where
were
the
places
I
could
also
go
wrong.
The
art
of
online
written
communications
In
college
I
also
learned
to
write
professional
online
communications.
The
interactions
with
my
professors
required
for
classes
made
me
learn
how
to
present
my
ideas
concisely
and
professionally.
I
learned
the
proper
formulas
for
addressing
people
over
email
depending
on
functions,
relationships
and
situations.
I've
learned
to
re-read
my
emails
after
writing
them.
Realizing
that
reading
the
email
at
least
once
before
sending
and
making
this
into
a
routine,
was
probably
the
key
aspect
I
have
learned
quickly
after
arriving
at
Lafayette.
The
many
and
various
seminars
from
the
Career
Services
and
from
the
Academic
Resouce
Center
provided
a
lot
of
vital
information
for
successful
professional
communication.
Engineering
Writing
Engineering
writing
courses
were
another
beast
I
had
to
face
while
at
Lafayette.
Although
the
subject
and
the
contents
of
the
writing
assignment
were
really
enjoyable
and
made
the
writing
process
more
pleasant,
the
assignments
had
different
standards
and
needed
a
different
approach.
The
overall
process
of
writing
was
the
same,
but
it
required
a
more
planned
attitude
towards
writing
and
a
better
understanding
and
organization
than
most
of
the
other
assignments.
In
addition
to
this,
most
laboratory
reports
and
project
reports
were
written
in
groups.
Thus,
trying
to
combine
a
number
of
different
styles
of
writing
was
a
challenge
I
was
faced
with
the
first
time
during
engineering
writing
courses.
Writing
about
New
Zealand
Interim
Trip
I
think
the
writing
assignment
for
the
New
Zealand
Interim
Trip
was
the
high
point
of
my
writing
career
so
far.
We
had
to
keep
a
diary
and
analyse
the
ways
in
which
we
learned
new
things
during
the
course
of
the
two
weeks
abroad.
We
did
not
have
a
word
limit,
we
did
not
have
a
style
requirement.
The
professors
wanted
to
see
the
best
from
our
creative
minds
while
also
noting
how
we
grew
up
during
the
trip.
I
enjoyed
the
assignment
so
much
that
I
wrote
a
paper
that
had
more
than
50
pages
with
images
included.
I
spent
time
writing
about
all
the
little
things
I
wrote
down
in
my
diary,
analysing
all
the
feelings
I
went
through
and
describing
all
the
new
exciting
experiences
we
were
exposed
to.
I
though
I
went
overboard
with
the
length
of
my
essay
because
it
was
nowhere
near
the
conciseness
standard
of
my
previous
writing
professors.
From
what
I
have
heard
from
them,
my
New
Zealand
professors
enjoyed
reading
my
paper
as
much
as
I
enjoyed
writing
it.
Where
am
I
now?
Where
will
I
go
from
here?
Right
now
I
am
at
a
point
where
I
have
gained
enough
confidence
in
my
writing
skills
and
also
gained
a
level
of
mastery
of
the
writing
process.
I
know
I
won't
have
answers
to
absolutely
all
the
problems
the
students
might
come
to
me
as
a
WA,
but
at
least
I
know
where
to
look
for
those
answers.
I
expect
that
the
WA
program
will
benefit
myself
at
least
as
much
as
it
benefits
other
student
who
are
at
the
beginning
of
the
road
to
college
writing.
I
expect
to
discover
new
subjects
and
ideas
through
the
essays
I
will
have
to
comment
on
and
to
learn
more
about
how
I
could
improve
my
own
writing
skills.
I
know
I
will
enjoy
providing
support
to
other
students
with
writing
tasks
and
I
hope
to
give
back
the
skills
I
have
gained
from
the
WAs
assigned
to
my
writing
courses.
