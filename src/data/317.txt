In
her
bedside
table
drawer
my
mother
still
keeps
my
first
written
piece.
Done
in
crayon
on
the
back
of
a
paper
soapbox,
it
is
a
shopping
list.
Sweets,
bread,
eggs
and
milk,
typed
in
crooked
letters.
I
was
four
years
old
when
I
learned
to
read
and
write.
I
was
much
more
keen
on
reading
than
writing
and
therefore
the
next
writing
attempt
that
I
remember
occurred
in
elementary
school.
I
remember
being
very
bored
during
my
first
two
years
of
school
since
all
we
did
was
learning
to
read
and
write.
The
only
problem
I
had
was
the
fact
that
my
letters
were
still
as
crooked
as
they
were
when
I
was
lour
years
old.
That
meant
hours
and
hours
of
tedious
calligraphy
exercises
that
were
somewhat
successful
in
rendering
a
reasonably
neat
handwriting.
I
changed
schools
after
fourth
grade1
and
it
was
in
my
new
school
that
I
really
started
to
write.
My
Polish
literature
teacher,
Ms.
Kelncr,
made
a
habit
of
having
us
write
at
least
six
literary
analyses
a
semester.
They
were
mainly
essays
on
main
issues
in
the
books
we
read
in
class.
She
was
known
in
our
school
for
being
very
strict
in
her
grading
system
and
very
demanding
in
her
expectations.
Throughout
my
years
in
elementary
school
1
wrote
pieces
on
Polish
medieval
poetry,
romantic
drama
and
modern
prose.
Going
into
high
school
I
had
a
fairly
good
writing
style
and
a
fairly
good
sense
of
writing
about
literature.
In
high
school,
with
a
different
literature
teacher,
we
focused
more
on
poetry
and
I
know
that
writing
about
poetry
helped
my
develop
my
imagination
and
was
the
closest
I
ever
got
to
creative
writing.
All
in
all
however,
high
school
writing
was
not
much
different
for
me
from
elementary
school
writing.
I
always
knew
what
was
expected
of
me
and
never
had
problems
with
meeting
these
expectations.
I
never
had
problems
with
spelling
or
grammar
and
always
(or
almost
always)
got
As
for
my
papers.
The
papers
were
returned
to
me
with
no
or
very
little
comments
my
teachers.
This
way
I
developed
a
fair
amount
of
confidence
in
my
own
writing
abilities
and
was
never
afraid
or
nervous
or
(what
is
much
worse
1
believe)
lacking
ideas
on
what
to
write
about.
As
1
said
my
elementary
and
high
school
writing
focused
mainly
on
literature.
I
did
some
writing
in
my
history
and
chemistry
classes,
but
it
was
rather
insignificant
as
a
part
of
my
grade
or
my
formation
as
a
writer.
One
of
the
parts
of
writing
classes
in
my
high
school
were
the
writing
exams.
We
were
given
a
section
of
class
material,
a
selection
of
readings
or
a
general
issue
to
study
and
during
the
exam
we
were
given
three
or
four
topics
to
choose
from
and
we
had
to
write
an
essay.
Thanks
to
these
exams
1
learned
to
organize
my
ideas
quickly
and
be
able
to
write
on
about
any
topic
but
also
acquired
a
habit
of
not
proofreading
my
work.
Simply
because
1
never
had
enough
time
to
reread
my
work
but
always
got
good
grades
I
made
it
a
rule
that
1
never
proofread.
As
Polish
people
say
the
ideas
that
come
first
are
always
the
best.
This
habit
haunts
me
to
this
day
and
it
is
with
great
pain
that
I
force
myself
to
review
my
papers.
It
has
to
be
said
here
so
that
the
reader
fully
understands
my
experience
that
din
ing
my
lime
in
high
school
almost
noone
in
Poland
had
owned
a
computer
and
all
the
writing
that
we
did
for
school
was
written
pen
on
paper.
I
had
no
experience
in
using
a
word
processor
and
I
did
not
know
what
a
proper
research
paper
was
(
I
realiyed
this
on
mz
first
f'YS
class).
With
these
experiences
1
went
on
to
college.
Writing
was
really
the
last
thing
on
my
mind.
1
was
in
a
new
country,
my
knowledge
of
English
much
poorer
than
I
thought
it
to
be.New
people,
new
experiences.
And
then
my
first
FYS
paper
topic
was
dropped
on
me
by
my
professor
who
for
some
reason
thought
1
shared
his
fascination
with
obscure
political
issues
in
XIX
eenturz
history.
1
was
on
a
stage
where
I
did
not
undrestand
all
he
said
properly
and
was
writing
my
first
research
paper
ever
on
election
laws
(all
I
ever
wrote
in
English
were
papers
like
Describe
zour
room
or
What's
your
perfect
holidaz
destination?).
It
was
hard
but
I
cannot
say
il
was
the
biggest
hurdle
I
had
to
jump
over
during
my
lirsl
semester
in
college.
I
succeded
in
writing
a
good
paper
but
I
owe
it
to
at
leats
a
couple
of
people.
The
professor
told
me
what
books
to
use,
I
figured
out
the
footnote
deal
with
the
help
of
the
Saint
Martin's
book
(another
thing
you
would
not
learn
in
a
Polish
high
school
is
how
to
use
footnotes)
but
there
were
all
these
little
things
that
I
just
couldn't
figure
out
by
myself.
1
was
luekz
1
guess
because
once
when
I
was
sitting
in
the
computer
lab
giving
finishing
touches
to
my
paper
my
friend
Joe
came
over
to
say
hi.
He
basically
corrected
all
the
spacing,
told
me
how
to
use
the
word
processor
properly
and
gave
me
all
the
advice
on
the
formal
side
of
writing
in
college
that
I
would
ever
need.
1
,ater
I
gave
to
paper
to
my
WA
who
was
also
very
halpful,
mainy
with
organization
of
my
paper
and
stating
my
thesis
clearly.
Before
the
meeting
with
writing
this
paper
was
like
walking
in
the
dark.
I
didn't
know
what
I
was
doing
or
wehter
I
was
doing
it
right.
After
having
talked
to
the
WA
I
was
confident
in
giving
the
paper
to
the
professor.
I
got
an
A
for
that
paper
and
later
that
semester
I
was
told
by
the
professor
that
I
don't
have
to
take
the
English
110.
1
regained
confidence
in
my
ability
to
write
well
in
that
very
moment
(even
too
much
confidence
1
think,
because
I
never
saw
the
WA
again
that
semster,
simply
because
I
finished
all
my
papers
on
the
night
before
due
date).
Another
formative
writing
experience
was
the
writing
class
I
took
my
sophomore
years
in
the
history
department.
The
paper
we
had
to
write
was
30
pages
long
and
we
did
it
in
steps.
We
handed
in
our
topics,
then
the
bibliography
and
then
the
outline
and
sections
of
the
paper.
This
experience
showed
me
how
important
each
of
these
steps
is.
During
my
two
years
in
col
lege
there
were
papers
that
I
wrote
the
day
before
they
were
due.
Courier
New
with
excessively
wide
margins
but
also
those
that
I
worked
on
for
the
whole
semester
and
felt
that
I
knew
almost
everything
on
the
topic
I
was
writing
about.
There
were
themes
I
chose
myself
and
themes
that
were
chosen
for
me
by
the
pro
l
essor.
I
never
got
a
grade
lower
than
an
A-
however,
and
I'm
satisfied
with
my
work
on
almost
all
of
these
papers.
I
slill
struggle
with
myself
when
I
write,
have
to
force
myself
to
revise
my
work
but
also
enjoy
it
very
much
when
1
face
a
new
topic,
do
research
and
became
familiar
with
the
subject
I'm
supposed
to
write
about.
Writing
papers
for
art
history
class
was
another
experience
that
formed
me
as
a
writer.
I
had
to
learn
to
rely
less
on
resources
and
write
in
a
different
style.
I
knew
that
I
have
succeeded
in
becoming
a
good
art
history
writer
during
my
study
abroad.
I
was
in
Florence,
Italy.
The
class
was
a
senior
seminar
and
I,
as
a
sophomore,
felt
rather
insecure
about
my
skills
and
knowledge.
We
had
to
make
a
final
presentation
with
slides
on
a
chosen
topic.
1
was
very
nervous
because
it
was
all
very
new
to
me.
I
couldn't
count
on
anyone
to
help
me
or
give
me
adviee.
In
the
end
the
presentation
came
out
great
and
the
professor
told
me
it
was
one
of
the
best
in
the
class.
Writing
comes
easy
now,
but
I
realize
that
this
facility
is
the
result
of
all
these
years
in
school
all
the
papers
I
wrote
and
all
the
comments
done
by
my
teachers
and
friends.
I
he
tact
that
now
I'm
going
to
be
a
WA
and
will
be
able
to
help
other
students
with
their
writing
makes
me
feel
proud
of
myself
because
English
is
not
my
native
language.
I
still
feel
that
there's
plenty
for
me
to
learn
and
I
know
I
will
learn
from
my
lei
low
WAs
but
also
from
the
students
that
will
give
me
their
papers
to
read.
