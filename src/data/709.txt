College
Writing
Program
Hello,
The
following
is
my
narrative
which
will
help
to
explore
my
journey
as
a
writer.
I
normally
write
in
a
strictly
academic
fashion,
so
this
is
my
attempt
at
free
writing.
Hopefully
it
will
be
rather
straightforward.
I
have
also
tried
to
make
it
at
least
a
tad
entertaining.
I
will
just
jump
right
in
then.
I
attended
a
well-respected
private
high
school,
which
prided
itself
on
producing
good
writers.
I,
therefore,
arrived
at
college
with
a
reasonably
solid
base
in
writing.
I
remember
being
informed
by
my
FYS
professor
that
we
would
need
to
see
a
Writing
Associate
in
order
to
go
over
some
of
our
pieces
of
writing.
I
thought
the
CWP
was
an
interesting
idea,
but
I
had
no
particular
feelings
towards
the
program.
I
did
have
expectations
though.
I
thought
that
the
WA
conferences
were
going
to
be
similar
to
any
other
meeting
I
had
experienced
when
someone
would
go
over
my
writing.
Such
meetings
generally
consisted
of
a
teacher
pointing
out
all
of
the
red
marks
on
my
paper,
informing
me
which
of
my
sentences
were
constructed
awkwardly,
and
highlighting
the
words
which
were
spelled
incorrectly.
To
put
it
bluntly,
I
expected
the
conference
to
be
a
grammar
check.
In
actuality,
as
all
of
us
know,
the
conference
was
quite
different.
My
first
few
conferences
with
my
WA
went
well.
We
talked
about
my
work,
what
I
was
doing,
where
I
was
planning
on
going.
She
was
a
good
WA,
but
I
felt
like
she
was
not
truly
getting
at
what
I
needed
help
with.
She
was
an
interested
reader
and
I
liked
talking
about
my
work
with
her,
but
I
did
not
see
how
the
conferences
were
necessarily
helping
to
improve
my
writing.
The
next
semester
I
was
enrolled
in
another
writing
course
and
was
assigned
to
another
WA.
Normally
I
would
not
state
her
name,
but
based
on
the
fact
that
everything
being
said
about
her
will
cast
her
in
an
extremely
positive
light,
I
do
not
feel
bad
revealing
that
it
was
Susan
Grunewald.
I
was
nervous
to
meet
with
Susan
because
we
were
already
friends
and
I
wasnyut
sure
if
it
would
be
weird
to
have
a
friend
for
a
WA.
My
meetings
with
Susan
turned
out
to
be
extremely
productive.
She
questioned
some
of
my
writing
techniques
that
I
had
honestly
never
put
too
much
thought
into.
She
asked
me
questions
about
my
writing
that
no
one
else
had
brought-up
with
me
before.
It
made
me
take
a
step
back
and
look
very
critically
at
all
of
my
subconscious
choices.
Our
conferences
were
extremely
beneficial,
and
she
actually
encouraged
me
to
be
a
WA.
I
realized
after
talking
to
various
people
that
their
WA
conferences
had
at
times
been
very
different
from
mine,
but
had
been
equally
beneficial
to
them.
There
is
no
single
way
to
run
a
conference,
because
every
person
will
need
something
presented
in
a
slightly
different
manner
in
order
to
get
him
or
her
to
think
about
his
or
her
writing
in
a
certain
way.
My
first
WA
had
clearly
been
a
good
WA,
but
her
style
had
not
clicked
with
me.
Susan
saw
what
I
needed
from
my
conferences,
and
if
I
ever
went
into
a
meeting
slightly
too
confident
about
my
work,
she
made
sure
I
didnyut
leave
that
way.
It
was
sometime
in
the
middle
of
my
second
semester
of
freshman
year
that
I
decided
to
apply
for
the
College
Writing
Program.
Now,
I
have
not
forgotten
that
the
point
of
this
piece
is
to
reflect
upon
our
previous
year
in
the
CWP,
and
I
am
quite
aware
that
my
narrative
has
started
a
bit
before
then.
I
felt
that
this
digression
was
a
necessity
though,
for
I
wanted
to
demonstrate
why
I
first
became
interested
in
the
program
and
why
I
applied.
Well
I
did
apply,
and
I
was
quite
excited
to
learn
of
my
acceptance
before
the
start
of
Sophomore
year.
My
first
semester
passed
well,
and
I
enjoyed
the
experience.
Second
semester
I
worked
in
the
PetShi
Rainforest
at
an
archaeological
site
and
proved
to
be
no
use
to
the
program
whatsoever,
but
I
returned
in
the
beginning
of
the
fall
semester
of
my
junior
year.
I
believe
we
are
now
caught
up
to
where
I
was
supposed
to
have
started
my
narrative
in
the
first
place.
Having
served
as
a
WA
for
one
semester
my
sophomore
year,
I
had
already
noted
that
my
writing
had
increased
in
quality
while
I
was
working
for
the
CWP.
I
was
therefore
exited
to
return
and
start
work
again.
Sophomore
year,
I
had
been
attempting
to
work
out
a
way
in
which
I
could
make
sure
every
conference
I
had
with
a
student
helped
said
student
as
much
as
possible.
As
I
previously
mentioned,
my
first
WAyus
technique
had
not
had
a
great
impact
on
me.
I
wanted
to
continue
to
work
on
the
goal
throughout
junior
year.
I
enjoyed
sitting
in
staff
meetings
and
listening
to
the
other
WAs.
I
wanted
learn
what
successful
approaches
they
used
and
which
techniques
maybe
were
not
the
best.
The
best
advice
I
received
was
to
always
just
let
the
student
decide
what
they
need.
If
you
ask
them
the
right
questions,
they
will
tell
you
what
they
need
help
in,
even
if
they
do
not
say
it
straight
out.
For
example,
I
had
one
meeting
in
which
a
student
came
in
and
sat
down.
I
began
the
conference
as
usual,
I
just
started
talking
with
her
to
see
how
she
was
doing
and
how
school
was
going.
It
became
clear
very
quickly
that
she
was
overwhelmed
with
work
and
other
commitments.
I
asked
her
how
her
research
was
going
for
the
paper
that
was
due
in
a
few
days,
and
she
said
it
was
going
well.
She
proceeded
to
show
me
all
of
the
articles
she
had
found,
and
she
certainly
had
found
a
lot
of
articles.
In
fact,
she
had
too
many
technical
articles
which
covered
a
large
subject
area.
After
asking
her
a
few
more
questions,
she
asked
if
I
could
help
show
her
some
research
techniques.
We
then
went
to
the
computer
and
I
spent
the
rest
of
the
conference
showing
her
good
sites
to
use
for
research,
such
as
JSTOR,
and
good
ways
to
search
within
those
sites.
Conferences
may
not
always
go
as
you
planned
them,
but
then
again
that
is
one
of
the
wonderful
things
about
the
facilitative
approach.
You
have
to
be
comfortable
with
running
a
conference
that
may
go
in
any
possible
direction.
I
believe
the
expression
mequick
on
your
feetmo
is
appropriate
here.
It
is
a
lot
easier
to
have
a
conference
that
is
geared
to
what
a
student
needs
than
I
thought
it
would
be,
all
one
needs
to
do
is
ask
the
right
questions
and
honestly
listen
to
their
answers.
There
are
some
cases
though
in
which
the
facilitative
approach
does
not
work.
There
is
always
that
one
student
who
either
does
not
get
what
I
am
trying
to
do
with
my
questions
and
is
therefore
unable
to
answer
them,
or
is
too
cool
for
school
and
thinks
I
should
never
speak
to
them
again(that
is
a
little
bit
of
an
exaggeration,
but
the
point
stands).
In
those
cases
I
find
that
I
sometimes
need
to
abandon
the
facilitative
approach
and
speak
to
them
directly.
I
had
one
student,
for
example,
who
thought
his
paper
was
flawless,
and
was
therefore
unwilling
to
listen
to
anything
I
had
to
say.
I
would
ask
him
a
question
in
regard
to
his
organization,
thought
process,
or
sentence
construction.
He
felt
that
everything
was
fine
though.
Finally,
I
needed
to
show
him
specific
examples
where
things
had
not
been
worded
as
well
as
they
could
have
been,
or
where
his
organization
and
thought
process
was
confusing.
We
then
proceeded
to
have
what
I
thought
was
a
very
good
conference.
At
the
end,
he
still
looked
at
me
and
said
that
he
appreciated
my
help,
but
he
didnyut
plan
on
changing
anything
in
his
paper.
You
win
some
and
you
lose
some.
I
tried.
At
this
point,
I
feel
that
I
should
say
that
being
a
WA
is
extremely
rewarding.
You
will
get
some
people
like
the
aforementioned
student,
but
such
is
life.
For
every
one
of
those
students,
you
will
have
a
number
that
greatly
appreciate
what
you
do
for
them.
I
enjoy
getting
to
help
someone
understand
something
about
either
their
paper,
or
the
way
in
which
they
write.
Have
you
experienced
the
ahaa
moment
during
writing?
Those
moments
when
something
clicks
and
suddenly
you
know
how
to
organize
a
section,
or
word
a
difficult
passage.
It
is
great
when
such
moments
occur
in
a
conference
and
you
can
see
the
sudden
comprehension
on
the
personyus
face.
Working
for
the
CWP
is
definitely
worth
it.
In
one
of
our
meetings,
Professor
Tatu
introduced
us
to
another
ideology.
This
ideology
came
in
the
form
of
an
article
called,
meThe
Believing
game.mo
The
article
states
that
students
today
are
trained
in
critical
thinking
from
a
young
age.
We
are
supposed
to
read
an
article
and
always
look
for
an
error,
a
false
strand
of
reasoning,
or
incorrect
data.
The
author
of
this
article
recommended
that
we
should
believe
what
we
read.
Try
to
get
into
the
authors
head
and
see
the
ways
in
which
they
are
thinking,
try
to
see
why
they
are
assuming
what
they
are
assuming,
and
why
they
feel
the
way
they
do.
If
someone
can
do
this
successfully,
then,
with
some
help
from
their
critical
thinking
skills,
they
can
help
to
construct
a
much
stronger
argument.
I
tried
to
follow
this
ideology
while
reading
students
papers.
It
is
not
helpful
to
show
a
student
all
of
the
ways
in
which
their
paper
lacks
sound
reasoning.
It
is
helpful
to
be
able
to
see
what
they
were
trying
to
say
and
then
lead
them
to
that
point.
The
technique
proved
to
be
quite
effective,
and
I
would
highly
recommend
reading
the
article.
I
did
it
no
justice
in
my
two-line
description.
The
College
Writing
Program
has
not
only
helped
me
to
become
a
better
WA,
but
also
a
better
writer.
I
greatly
enjoy
getting
to
work
along
side
my
partner
professor.
This
is
an
aspect
of
the
program
which
I
just
began
to
enjoy
this
past
year.
I
worked
with
the
same
professor
in
the
Fall
and
the
Spring
semester,
and
I
look
forward
to
working
with
her
again
this
Fall.
Our
conversations
gave
me
a
lot
of
insight
into
why
professors
create
prompts
the
way
they
do.
We
would
often
have
conversations
about
her
writing
prompts
in
order
to
make
sure
I
knew
what
she
wanted,
and
so
that
she
could
make
sure
that
she
had
worded
them
properly.
She
would
often
ask
for
my
advice
and
actually
listen
to
what
I
had
to
say.
Such
an
experience
helps
me
to
better
analyze
the
prompts
that
my
professors
assign
to
me
in
class.
Reading
student
writing
also
helps
me
to
critique
my
own
writing,
seeing
as
it
is
also
student
writing.
I
commit
many
of
the
same
errors
that
I
see
frequently
in
the
papers
I
read.
Having
read
over
so
many
papers
has
made
me
much
more
adept
at
finding
those
mistakes.
I
am,
therefore,
much
more
effective
at
proof
reading
my
own
work.
Working
for
the
CWP
has
greatly
improved
my
own
style,
and
has
allowed
me
to
write
with
a
confidence
I
previously
lacked.
I
am
afraid
I
have
wandered
around
a
good
amount
in
this
narrative,
but
such
is
the
nature
of
story
telling.
Within
this
piece,
I
attempted
to
explain
why
I
became
interested
and
joined
the
CWP
in
the
first
place,
various
techniques
and
strategies
I
use
in
conferences,
my
thoughts
on
various
ideologies
including
meThe
believing
gamemo
and
the
facilitative
approach
to
conferences,
and
finally
demonstrated
how
working
for
the
CWP
has
made
my
own
writing
better.
If
in
actuality
I
have
failed
to
include
one
of
these
various
aspects
in
this
piece,
I
am
sorry
for
the
false
advertisement.
I
hope
you
call
me
on
it
as
well!
I
would
enjoy
getting
to
meet
you
and,
as
the
CWP
has
also
taught
me,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
finished
piece
of
writing.
Until
then,
I
look
forward
to
meeting
you,
and
depending
on
who
you
are,
seeing
you
again.
