Literacy
Narrative
W.A.
Workshop
2008
As
I
approach
my
senior
year
of
college,
it
seems
easy
for
me
to
reflect
on
how
IOve
grown
as
a
writer
during
my
four
years
here
at
Lafayette.
However,
what
many
people
donOt
realize
is
that
becoming
a
stronger
writer
is
a
slow
process
that
isnOt
readily
noticeable
overnight.
ItOs
a
process
that
takes
place
over
time.
This
has
become
apparent
to
me
especially
over
the
last
year.
My
junior
year
of
college
was
certainly
one
of
challenge
and
struggle
as
a
Writing
Associate.
At
times
I
grew
frustrated
not
only
with
students
missing
conferences,
but
being
enthusiastic
enough
to
keep
the
professors
IOve
worked
with
to
stay
enthusiastic
towards
the
program.
ItOs
with
the
help
of
my
peers
and
the
professors
of
the
program
that
really
helped
me
grow,
on
top
of
meeting
with
students
that
I
held
conferences
with.
When
I
was
initially
hired
as
a
Writing
Associate,
I
was
very
afraid
of
asking
a
stupid
question.
I
figured
I
had
to
already
know
the
answers
if
they
had
hired
me
as
a
sophomore.
I
learned
quickly
over
time
that
the
staff
and
the
professors
didnOt
expect
you
to
know
everything.
I
soon
realized
that
the
best
WAOs
ask
the
questions
and
they
inquire
for
helpful
answers.
It
was
then
I
realized
that
this
same
technique
should
be
applied
to
my
conferences.
Being
placed
to
work
with
engineering
classes
and
other
majors
allowed
me
to
ask
questions
and
inquire
for
answers
from
the
students.
It
allowed
them
to
explain
the
subject
to
me
and
often
times
helped
them
realize
on
their
own
what
exactly
the
purpose
of
their
paper
was
and
what
point
they
were
trying
to
get
across.
It
also
set
a
tone
for
the
conferences
that
showed
the
students
that
I
wasnOt
their
superior
in
writing.
I
was
their
peer.
It
not
only
allowed
students
to
be
in
charge
of
the
conferences,
it
allowed
them
to
ask
the
questions
they
may
not
have
otherwise
asked
to
the
professors.
For
me,
this
was
one
of
the
most
rewarding
aspects
of
being
a
Writing
Associate
at
Lafayette.
When
I
initially
met
with
students
at
the
beginning
of
both
semesters,
I
established
a
tone
that
told
studentOs
I
was
in
no
way
superior
to
them.
If
I
was
working
with
freshman,
I
explained
the
program
and
its
main
purpose.
This
made
the
conferences
easier
in
respect
to
the
students
feeling
comfortable
to
ask
the
questions
and
make
the
explanations
without
feeling
inferior.
ItOs
especially
important
for
new
Writing
Associates
to
be
able
to
conduct
conferences
with
friends.
While
it
may
sometimes
be
difficult
to
have
the
professional
demeanor
with
a
student
who
may
also
be
a
friend,
itOs
key
that
the
WA
establishes
the
task
that
needs
to
be
accomplished
in
the
time
allotted
and
makes
sure
the
conferences
moves
accordingly.
Using
this
same
technique,
I
plan
on
using
it
not
just
with
students,
but
with
whoever
I
encounter.
Another
important,
but
key
technique
to
making
the
conferences
smoother
is
getting
to
know
the
students
your
working
with.
Whether
it
be
a
football
game,
activities
theyOre
involved
with
on
campus
or
where
they
are
living,
initially
making
small
talk
also
makes
the
student
more
comfortable
with
you.
One
of
the
most
difficult
obstacles
I
encountered
over
the
last
year
was
staying
in
touch
and
keeping
my
professors
enthusiastic.
In
the
fall
semester,
I
was
paired
with
Tim
SilvestriOs
FYS
class.
It
was
a
small
class
of
eager
freshman
willing
to
expand
their
horizons
concerning
the
writing
process,
and
the
professor
was
just
as
enthusiastic.
It
was
a
smooth
semester
to
say
the
least
and
I
learned
a
great
deal
from
the
studentOs
papers
as
I
hope
they
learned
a
great
deal
about
writing.
During
the
spring
semester,
I
was
assigned
to
a
VaST
class
in
the
engineering
department.
I
had
a
difficult
time
getting
a
hold
of
the
professor
and
keeping
him
enthusiastic
towards
the
writing
program.
The
only
emails
I
would
receive
from
him
were
the
vague
syllabusOs
he
sent
to
his
students
letting
them
know
what
their
next
assignment
was.
His
students
were
a
different
story.
They
were
all
about
the
conferences,
and
despite
the
professor
being
difficult
to
remain
in
contact
with,
the
students
were
on
top
of
their
work,
keeping
me
updated
about
when
papers
were
due
so
I
could
send
them
out
a
schedule
to
meet
with
me
to
discuss
their
writing.
While
it
ended
up
working
out
to
the
studentsO
benefit,
I
wish
I
had
figured
out
a
better
way
to
keep
better
contact
with
the
professor
over
the
course
of
the
semester.
I
knew
there
was
no
forbidden
way
to
go
about
this
kind
of
situation,
but
I
feel
like
I
could
have
certainly
done
a
better
job.
ItOs
important
for
new
Writing
Associates
to
know
that
as
important
it
is
to
have
the
studentOs
interests
in
mind,
itOs
also
important
to
maintain
and
provide
for
the
professorOs
interests.
Balancing
the
relationship
between
the
professor
and
students
can
often
be
challenging,
but
I
would
definitely
encourage
WAs
to
ask
those
questions
during
staff
meetings
they
donOt
know
the
answer
to,
or
(if
youOre
more
like
myself)
ask
a
fellow
veteran
associate
when
you
run
into
them.
I
feel
like
I
figured
out
too
late
that
the
veteran
WAs
were
more
than
happy
to
help
me
out
when
I
didnOt
know
the
answer.
One
of
my
weaknesses
that
I
plan
to
continue
working
on
is
not
being
afraid
to
ask
for
advice
when
I
find
myself
in
a
bind.
IOve
realized
that
nothing
is
absolute
and
there
is
usually
a
solution
for
almost
every
problem
WAs
run
into.
One
of
the
veteran
WAs
that
I
consistently
asked
advice
from
was
Sam
Alvino.
She
was
always
extremely
nice
and
open
to
me
whenever
we
had
drop-in
hours
together
and
soon
enough
I
found
myself
asking
her
for
advice
when
I
needed
it
or
when
I
was
too
afraid
to
ask
during
staff
meetings
(which
could
be
intimidating
sometimes
for
me).
She
gave
great
advice
and
told
stories
about
her
own
difficulties
and
how
she
solved
them
and
soon
enough
I
found
myself
mirroring
not
only
her
problem
solving
skills
but
also
how
she
conducted
herself
in
conferences.
She
was
personable
and
positive,
which
I
find
are
two
of
the
most
important
POs
in
the
writing
program
if
you
want
to
gain
trust
from
your
students.
Over
the
course
of
the
year
IOve
found
that
conducting
conferences
helps
you
learn
a
great
deal
about
your
writing
and
asking
questions
helps
you
obtain
even
more
knowledge
about
the
people
youOre
working
with
and
the
writing
process
altogether,
which
has
helped
me
personally
develop
more
of
a
style.
ItOs
also
helped
me
get
to
know
and
adapt
to
other
styles
of
writing
that
I
may
not
have
otherwise
encountered
if
it
wasnOt
for
the
writing
program.
Another
big
influence
on
my
Writing
Associate
experience
is
Allison
Shapp.
The
beginning
of
the
fall
semester
for
her
was
a
rocky
one,
but
she
ended
up
in
a
very
fitting
role
downtown
at
the
ProJect
Easton
building.
When
Allison
told
me
her
story,
I
was
immediately
intrigued
by
the
work
she
was
doing
and
the
people
she
was
working
with.
Towards
the
end
of
the
semester
I
made
it
my
mission
to
learn
more
about
it
in
hopes
of
doing
something
different
for
my
senior
year
as
a
Writing
Associate.
Allison
helped
me
get
in
contact
with
Prof.
Falbo
so
I
could
have
a
trial
run
after
school
ended
downtown
at
the
ProJect
Easton
building.
I
immediately
fell
in
love
with
the
demeanor
of
the
program
as
well
as
the
courageous
women
and
men
I
met
during
my
couple
of
hours
getting
to
know
the
program.
I
hope
to
continue
what
Allison
has
started
this
fall
with
Prof.
Falbo.
The
biggest
surprise
of
my
summer
so
far
is
when
I
got
hired
in
the
Network
Management
department
of
JPMorgan
Chase
in
New
York
City.
With
no
background
in
banking
(and
applying
to
the
job
merely
for
fun),
I
was
skeptical
about
why
they
hired
me
and
what
I
could
possibly
be
doing
considering
I
knew
nothing
about
banking
or
finances.
It
was
similar
to
being
assigned
to
an
FYS
class
I
had
no
background
in.
I
went
to
my
first
day
slightly
nervous,
but
ready
to
tackle
whatever
obstacles
came
in
my
way.
During
the
first
week
or
so,
I
was
sure
to
ask
questions
when
I
didnOt
understand
an
assignment
and
tried
to
gain
a
better
understand
of
banking
and
how
it
works.
They
had
me
refresh
Settlement
System
Market
Practice
Assessments,
create
the
2009
Holiday
Trading
Calendar
for
the
internet,
and
I
was
also
working
on
the
Annual
Global
Custody
Review,
which
summarizes
and
explains
our
relationship
with
foreign
banks.
It
seems
that
I
had
a
lot
of
editing
and
creating
to
do
as
far
as
the
Custody
Review
and
Assessments,
and
other
colleagues
had
asked
me
to
edit
and
create
documents
for
presentations.
It
was
to
my
surprise
during
a
lunch
with
my
boss
that
the
reason
I
was
hired
was
because
of
my
strong
background
in
writing
and
English.
They
were
impressed
with
the
Writing
Program
and
felt
that
hiring
an
Intern
with
a
background
in
writing
would
help
the
companyOs
language
and
demeanor
through
the
reports
aforementioned.
I
was
floored.
It
was
here
that
I
realized
how
important
writing
and
the
writing
process
is
to
any
industry
in
the
economy,
especially
now.
Writing
is
applicable
not
just
to
one
field,
but
to
many
fields.
WAOs
need
to
understand
that
if
they
have
a
student
in
a
math
major
or
maybe
engineering,
writing
is
applicable
to
every
aspect
of
life,
and
that
needs
to
be
emphasized
to
students
everywhere.
