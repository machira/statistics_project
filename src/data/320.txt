The
Road
to
Successful
Writing
At
first,
I
thought
I
would
have
a
lot
of
trouble
with
this
assignment.
My
career
in
writing
seemed
far
too
uneventful
and
insignificant
to
fill
7
pages,
let
alone
hold
a
captive
audience
of
readers,
including
my
future
employers
and
Writing
Associate
peers.
So,
in
between
weekend
vacations,
during
my
lunch
break
at
work,
or
any
other
down
time
I
managed
to
find,
I
began
to
think
of
how
I
came
to
have
a
writing
career.
How
had
I
gotten
this
far
without
stopping
to
think
about
where
I
had
started
and
what
had
propelled
me
along
the
way?
The
first
thing
that
came
to
mind
was,
strangely
enough,
not
even
a
literary
piece.
Although
the
actual
writing
was
limited
to
a
few
sentences
or
captions
on
each
page,
The
Wiley
and
Riley
Coloring
Book
stands
out
as
my
first
creative
masterpiece.
In
third
grade,
my
best
friend
and
I
came
across
an
old
booklet
containing
about
7
0
empty
pages.
This
empty
canvas
quickly
became
a
potential
summer
project.
A
coloring
book,
we
decided,
in
which
each
page
contained
a
character
named
either
Wiley
or
Riley.
There
were
owls,
turtles,
dogs,
people,
insects,
even
football
teams.
All
were
involved
in
some
sort
of
humorous
situation.
The
70
pages
proved
to
be
more
than
a
couple
of
9-year-olds
could
handle
in
one
summer.
Our
coloring
book
wouldn't
be
completed
for
at
least
another
year.
But
the
creative
process
was
more
invaluable
than
the
70
Wileys
and
Rileys.
That
project
taught
me
that
I
could
make
something
out
of
nothing;
that
a
booklet
of
blank
pages
could
become
a
strange
and
crazy
world
of
characters.
My
friend
and
cocreator,
now
an
English
major
at
Yale
University,
with
plans
to
become
a
professional
writer,
still
has
our
first
collaborative
creative
effort.
Keeping
in
mind
my
artistic
beginnings
as
a
cartoonist,
my
next
memorable
project
came
in
the
form
of
an
entry
for
the
fifth
grade
Write
and
Illustrate
Your
Own
Book
Contest.
I
can
remember
having
this
intricate
idea
for
an
elaborate
book,
with
wonderful
pictures,
an
intriguing
storyline
and
a
captivating
cover.
I
formulated
a
story
about
3
unusual
travel
companions,
Santa
Claus,
the
Tooth
Fairy,
and
the
Easter
Bunny,
and
the
strange
happenings
of
their
vacation
to
the
Bahamas.
I
can't
remember
many
of
the
details
of
the
story.
The
Tooth
Fairy
lost
her
shoe,
the
Easter
Bunny
was
afraid
to
fly,
and
Santa
hated
the
warm
weather.
I
didn't
win
the
contest,
but
I
do
remember
excitedly
making
plans
for
a
sequel,
a
trip
to
Africa
maybe.
Looking
back
now,
I
think
this
was
when
I
discovered
that
I
actually
liked
to
write.
Unlike
other
kids
who
groaned
when
we
had
to
write
an
essay
or
a
poem,
I
immediately
started
going
over
the
assignment
in
my
head.
That
same
year,
a
poetry
assignment
turned
into
an
entry
in
the
school
district
Reflections
Contest.
We
were
given
a
theme,
New
Beginnings,
and
asked
to
submit
a
creative
piece.
My
teacher
assigned
poetry
to
my
class.
A
new
beginning
can
be
riding
a
horse.
It
can
be
a
new
baby,
of
course...
my
poem
began.
Before
I
learned
about
stanzas
or
the
use
of
slant
rhyme,
I
learned
about
expressing
myself
with
words.
I
learned
how
simple
and
easy
it
could
be,
despite
the
initial
fear
poetry
causes
in
most
ten
year
olds.
My
poem
won
an
honorable
mention
in
the
contest,
for
which
I
was
invited
to
a
banquet
and
presented
a
green
ribbon.
I
remember
how
proud
my
parents
were
and
how
excited
my
teacher
was.
This
small
achievement
allowed
me
to
realize
that
there
was
something
that
I
was
good
at.
I
saw
that
I
could
do
something
that
not
all
the
other
kids
could
do.
Throughout
middle
school
I
continued
to
excel
at
my
English
and
Reading
classes.
Writing
came
relatively
easily
to
me.
However,
I
didn't
write
much
outside
of
school
assignments.
I
made
a
few
half-hearted
attempts
at
keeping
diaries
or
journals,
but
I
could
never
get
into
a
consistent
routine
of
writing
on
my
own.
I
regret
that
I
didn't
take
this
time
to
develop
my
writing
skills
outside
of
school,
and
I
would
find
out
later
how
recreational,
non-academic
writing
could
have
really
helped
me.
A
sophomore
European
History
class
assignment
provided
a
new
dimension
to
my
exposure
to
academic
writing.
Until
then,
most
of
the
writing
I
had
done
for
class
had
been
research
papers.
Most
of
these
assignments
involved
researching
a
topic,
thyroid
disease
or
Ancient
Egypt,
and
reporting
my
findings.
Although
I
was
learning
about
various
topics,
my
writing
skills
were
somewhat
limited
to
rewording
scientific
findings
and
paraphrasing
encyclopedia
articles.
But
fourth
quarter
sophomore
year,
my
class
was
assigned
a
term
paper.
The
thought
of
coming
up
with
8
pages
of
writing
was
terrifying
to
us.
The
quantity
of
pages
seemed
nothing
when
we
realized
that
our
teacher
also
expected
a
new
quality
of
writing,
one
with
a
thesis
statement
and
an
attempt
to
actually
prove
something
with
our
writing.
We
had
all
learned
about
thesis
statements
and
even
memorized
the
definition
for
freshmen
English,
but
we
didn't
think
that
we
would
actually
be
expected
to
apply
our
knowledge.
Surely
thesis
statements
were
for
college
students
and
graduate
work.
Then
I
realized
that
my
teacher
had
assigned
us
this
paper
because
she
expected
more
from
us
than
rewriting
an
encyclopedia.
She
was
challenging
us
with
a
new
type
of
writing
that
would
better
prepare
us
for
the
expectations
that
would
face
us
as
we
progressed
towards
college.
My
first
term
paper,
a
not-quite-eight-page
piece,
was
about
Confucius
and
his
influence
on
Eastern
culture.
My
thesis
statement
was
vague
and
I
struggled
to
find
support
for
my
assertions
and
remain
focused
at
the
same
time.
When
the
papers
were
returned
my
classmates
and
I
found
them
marked
with
almost
as
much
red
as
there
was
black.
My
first
attempt
at
a
term
paper
appeared
to
be
a
disaster.
But
as
I
read
over
the
red
markings
and
reviewed
what
I
had
wrote,
I
realized
that
the
comments
were
not
just
corrections
and
admonishments,
but
constructive
criticisms
that
would
ultimately
help
me
learn
to
write
better
thesis
statements
and
form
focused
arguments.
My
history
teacher
gave
us
little
initial
guidance
for
our
papers.
She
knew
that
we
had
no
idea
how
to
write
a
term
paper,
but
she
let
us
try.
After
our
first
failed
attempts,
she
used
our
mistakes
to
teach
us
the
right
way
to
construct
a
term
paper.
I
learned
more
about
thesis
statements
from
writing
a
bad
one
than
I
did
from
memorizing
definitions.
Instead
of
just
giving
us
the
formula
for
writing
a
good
term
paper,
she
let
us
discover
our
own
method
through
revising
and
correcting
our
own
writing.
I
think
I
learned
more
about
writing
from
that
history
class
than
I
did
from
any
of
the
English
classes
I
had
taken
up
to
that
point.
The
following
two
years
I
would
take
Honors
and
Advanced
Placement
English
classes
with
the
same
teacher
both
years.
This
gave
her
a
chance
to
become
familiar
with
my
writing
style
and
monitor
the
progress
that
I
made.
In
those
classes
I
wrote
informative
and
persuasive
speeches
and
essays,
learned
to
summarize
other
pieces
of
writing,
and
worked
on
poetry
and
creative
writing.
I
learned
how
to
write
well.
Not
only
did
I
learn
to
write
well,
I
also
learned
to
write
in
the
way
that
impressed
teachers.
Where
the
actual
content
of
my
papers
was
lacking,
my
well-developed
writing
skills
took
over.
In
short,
I
learned
the
art
of
telling
them
what
they
want
to
hear.
Since
I
could
write
fairly
easily
on
any
number
of
topics,
and
do
so
in
such
a
way
as
to
earn
good
grades,
I
thought
I
was
well
prepared
for
whatever
college
writing
had
to
offer.
I
would
soon
learn
differently.
I
entered
my
first
year
seminar
feeling
fully
prepared
for
whatever
writing
assignments
I
would
encounter.
I
could
write
term
papers,
poetry,
essays.
I
was
confident
that
I
would
do
well
and
didn't
think
I
would
have
much
to
learn
in
terms
of
bettering
my
writing.
One
of
the
weekly
assignments
my
professor
gave
us
was
to
write
a
letter
to
the
editor
of
the
New
York
Times.
We
had
to
subscribe
to
the
paper,
and
could
write
our
letter
on
anything
in
the
week's
paper
that
pertained
to
our
class.
We
didn't
have
to
send
the
letters
to
the
editor,
simply
hand
them
in
to
our
professor
weekly.
With
a
250-word
limit,
this
assignment
seemed
like
an
easy
Thursday
night
project.
The
first
week
though,
I
found
myself
stretching
to
find
something
that
related
to
the
class.
I
managed
to
find
something
and
write
what
I
thought
was
a
decent
letter,
not
my
best
work,
but
decent.
The
next
week
our
professor
handed
the
papers
back.
I
wasn't
disappointed
with
the
grade,
but
I
did
notice
the
comment
on
the
bottom,
Well-written,
but
more
light
than
heat.
I
went
to
meet
with
my
professor
about
an
upcoming
paper
and
he
asked
to
discuss
my
letter.
He
told
me
that
he
could
tell
I
was
a
very
talented
writer,
but
that
my
writing
talents
couldn't
cover
up
the
fact
that
I
had
no
argument
or
support
for
an
argument
in
my
letter.
I
had
finally
encountered
a
teacher
who
was
going
to
challenge
my
writing.
Instead
of
praising
my
work
for
being
well-
written
and,
for
the
most
part,
ignoring
the
lack
of
content,
this
professor
asked
me
to
think
about
what
I
was
writing.
I
couldn't
just
tell
them
what
they
want
to
hear
any
more.
I
had
to
tell
them
what
I
want
to
say.
My
professor,
whether
he
knows
it
or
not,
taught
me
the
difference
between
writing
and
expressing
my
thoughts
in
writing.
I
could
always
write,
now
I
had
to
learn
to
express
myself
through
writing.
Years
of
only
writing
in
an
academic
context
conditioned
me
to
write
what
was
needed
to
get
the
grade.
Now
I
had
to
focus
on
what
I
was
saying
instead
of
how
I
was
saying
it.
I
knew
the
rules
of
grammar
and
the
organization
and
structure
of
papers,
now
I
had
to
add
original
thought
and
intellectual
substance.
My
writing
improved
significantly
in
that
first
semester
if
only
because
someone
finally
challenged
me
to
do
more.
I
think
the
most
important
lesson
I
learned
was
that
there
was
always
room
for
improvement.
Throughout
my
college
career
my
writing
skills
have
continued
to
evolve.
So
my
seemingly
insignificant
and
uneventful
writing
career
turned
out
to
be
more
than
I
expected.
Forced
to
reflect
on
simple
things
like
my
first
creative
project
and
more
complex
assignments
like
my
first
term
paper
allowed
me
to
realize
how
my
skills
as
a
writer
have
developed.
Different
teachers
and
experiences
have
brought
me
to
where
I
am
today.
My
writing
history
is
far
from
over
as
I
prepare
to
encounter
new
professors,
new
assignments,
other
writers,
and
new
prospective
as
a
Writing
Associate.
