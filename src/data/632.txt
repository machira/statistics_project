Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative
I
frequently
refer
to
this
last
year
of
my
life
as
one
of
the
most
formative
Iuve
ever
experienced.
From
gaining
status
as
an
upper
classmen,
to
an
extensive
amount
of
travel,
to
cultivating
relationships
that
will
follow
me
for
the
rest
of
my
life,
these
changes
Iuve
undergone
are
reflected
in
a
variety
of
places,
including
my
written
work.
My
history
as
a
writer
remains
the
same
p
Ium
still
the
girl
who
was
penning
short
stories
in
her
basement
after
school
as
an
inexhaustible
third
grader
p
but
this
history
has
developed
with
the
introduction
of
people,
experiences,
and
my
interactions
with
new
places
and
cultures.
The
culmination
of
these
three
forces
has
elevated
my
work
both
technically
and
in
content.
Not
only
do
I
have
more
interesting
things
to
write
about
after
a
little
life
experience,
but
I
also
have
a
much
firmer
grasp
on
the
threads
by
which
my
written
pieces
are
sewn
together.
The
first
power
behind
my
changes
as
a
writer
I
credit
firmly
to
new
people.
My
address
book
has
gotten
exponentially
heavier
within
the
last
twelve
months.
From
internships
in
Washington,
to
opportunities
as
Lafayette,
to
a
semester
abroad,
my
cup
runneth
over
with
new
social
circles.
With
many
of
these
new
relationships
I
found
new
perspective
and
life
experience
p
in
some
cases
even
vernacular.
The
more
time
I
was
granted
with
each
of
these
new
groups
led
to
a
better
understanding
of
what
else
was
out
there.
When
it
came
to
my
friends
in
Washington,
I
got
a
glimpse
into
the
minds
of
a
different
political
party.
With
my
new
friends
in
London,
I
got
a
fresh
perspective
on
how
America
is
viewed
abroad,
as
well
as
a
slew
of
new
phrases
to
add
to
my
vocab.
After
integrating
myself
into
a
group
of
engineers
at
Lafayette
and
going
camping
one
sticky
July
weekend,
I
was
granted
a
look
at
how
the
left-brained
approach
tasks.
While
none
of
these
situations
would
signal
a
dramatic
change
in
my
writing,
Iud
go
to
the
mattresses
that
people
have
innately
changed
the
way
I
think
and
approach
questions.
I
have
a
broader
scope
to
draw
from
and
more
opinions
to
consider.
The
content
of
my
written
work
is
coming
from
a
place
that
is
more
well
rounded,
resulting
in
pieces
that
are
both
more
informed
and
balanced
p
at
least
that
is
my
hope.
People
have
also
influenced
my
work
in
subtler
ways.
So
much
of
what
we
write
is
inherently
influenced
by
what
we
hear.
Conversations,
lectures,
and
even
the
media
program
us
with
colloquialisms
and
vocabulary
that,
with
time
and
repetition,
creep
into
our
written
work.
This
past
fall
I
had
the
pleasure
of
moving
into
McKevly
House,
Lafayetteus
honors
housing
program.
It
was
an
occasion
that
would
put
me
in
contact
with
people
who
would
become
not
just
housemates,
but
best
friends.
While
it
was
not
a
change
I
initially
anticipated,
these
newfound
kindred
spirits
did
more
than
provide
me
with
long
lasting
relationships
or
an
array
of
inside
jokes
shared
in
the
comfort
of
our
off-campus
mansion.
Conversations
with
my
McKelvy
friends,
some
of
the
best
Iuve
ever
had,
have
manifested
themselves
into
my
writing,
again
in
method,
but
also
in
vocabulary.
Our
house
is
truly
full
of
conversationalists.
One
of
my
newest
and
best
friends
in
McKelvy
is
known
for
his
mastery
of
the
English
language,
dropping
four
syllable
words
and
literary
allusions
at
almost
every
encounter.
While
we
tease
him
for
his
two-dollar
words,
truth
be
told,
they
are
rubbing
off
of
me.
Conversing
daily
with
someone
who
has
that
sort
of
grasp
of
English
has
made
me
both
more
articulate
and
better
on
paper.
Another
new
friend
is
a
philosophy
junkie
with
many
a
debate
title
to
his
name.
He
imparted
some
of
his
debating
knowledge
to
me,
along
with
all
the
jargon,
this
past
year.
He
has
done
wonders
for
me
in
regards
to
approaching
prompts
and
questions.
Late
night
conversations
with
him
in
our
lounge
have
allowed
me
to
examine
situations
from
a
far
more
philosophical
standpoint.
Itus
a
much
larger
picture
Ium
working
with
now.
Our
exchanges
have
also
introduced
me
to
the
forensics
side
of
things,
where
every
point,
agree
or
disagree,
can
be
argued.
Itus
a
world
of
strategy
and
a
whole
new
pedagogy.
Iud
be
lying
if
I
said
it
was
stuff
that
doesnut
now
cross
my
mind
when
I
attack
arguments
in
a
paper.
Outside
of
my
big-brained
friends
at
home
who
have
added
both
new
ways
of
thinking
as
well
as
lingo
to
my
work,
new
people
have
also
allowed
me
to
better
my
writing
in
a
stylistic
sense.
Iuve
written
before
about
my
history
as
a
journalism
student.
A
year
later,
and
my
roots
as
Lois
Lane
have
not
changed,
but
the
influence
of
other
reporters
have
taken
my
AP-style
work
to
the
next
level.
November
2008
marked
the
collegeus
second
live
election
broadcast
and
my
second
time
in
the
anchorus
chair.
Months
of
practice
with
media
consultant
and
mentor
Nancy
Werteen
had
me
ready
to
write
my
content
as
we
got
the
results
in
p
a
scenario
comparable
to
writing
a
paper
in
a
pressure
cooker.
Practicing
weekly
and
cultivating
a
relationship
with
Nancy
got
out
all
of
the
butterflies
and
truly
prepared
me
for
that
night,
while
simultaneously
sharpening
my
journalistic
writing.
A
genre
of
work
that
is
completely
short
and
sweet
p
clearly
not
the
style
in
which
I
attacked
this
narrative,
as
this
is
a
rare
chance
to
extrapolate
about
my
own
life,
and
few
people
can
be
short-lived
when
writing
about
themselves
p
Nancy
was
reporting.
An
anchor
with
the
local
Channel
69
News,
she
showed
me
her
tapes
of
live
broadcasts.
I
read
her
work,
I
listened
to
her
speak,
and
after
three
months
of
this
repetition,
I
was
ready
for
the
test.
It
was
time
to
go
live
and
write
my
own
stuff
on
air.
I
like
to
think
I
made
the
grade,
much
in
part
to
the
guidance
of
someone
who
has
been
reporting
for
much
longer
than
yours
truly.
The
live
election
broadcast
is
also
a
prime
example
of
the
second
force
that
has
changed
my
writing
within
the
past
year,
and
that
is
new
life
experience.
This
year
was
littered
with
new
adventures,
among
which
was
my
first
time
as
a
WA
with
Lafayette
College.
The
correlation
to
changes
is
my
written
work
are
easier
to
spot
within
this
example,
and
also
cater
to
a
slightly
more
technical
side
of
things.
With
orientation
and
regular
staff
meetings
in
Pardee,
I
came
to
understand
the
difference
between
lower
and
higher
order
concerns,
a
simple
distinction
that
Iuve
since
noticed
has
given
me
a
huge
advantage
over
writers
who
donut
see
the
hierarchy.
Just
last
week
a
friend
asked
me
to
look
at
a
paper,
but
was
appalled
when
my
remarks
had
little
to
do
with
comma
splices,
but
rather
dealt
with
the
very
heart
of
her
argument.
Several
drafts
later,
and
I
think
she
has
something
much
more
solid,
and
itus
not
because
all
of
her
commas
are
in
a
row,
but
because
the
higher
order
concerns
were
sorted
beforehand.
My
work
as
a
WA
has
also
provided
me
with
a
much-needed
groundwork
for
writing.
While
I
loved
my
high
school
dearly,
the
regular
arrival
and
departure
of
teachers
shook
up
the
content
of
our
daily
lessons,
and
grammar
fell
by
the
wayside.
I
donut
know
that
I
ever
learned
the
basic
parts
of
speech
or
all
the
appropriate
usages
of
the
comma.
I
did
a
lot
of
reading
and
writing
regardless,
and
somehow
absorbed
about
eighty
percent
of
the
rules
from
my
periphery.
Nonetheless,
present
perfect
always
sounded
like
something
I
should
know
about,
but
we
never
quite
got
that
far
in
my
high
school
classroom.
At
last
a
WA,
I
became
cognizant
of
what
I
didnut
know;
itus
nothing
like
blinding
self-awareness
to
put
things
in
perspective.
A
student
asked
me
in
a
conference
about
the
usage
of
the
word
rthats
and
I
became
totally
tongue-tied,
as
if
Iud
never
used
the
word
rthats
before.
Understanding
that
my
flaws
were
embedded
within
the
technical
aspects
of
writing
allowed
me
to
hone
in
on
my
weakness.
Both
in
my
work
and
as
I
reviewed
papers
for
peers,
my
personal
goal
was
to
develop
a
sharper
eye
for
the
basics.
It
was
like
being
a
pianist
who
can
play
a
real
nice
concerto,
but
has
difficulty
reading
the
music.
It
was
time
for
me
to
look
at
the
notes
on
the
page.
I
feel
like
itus
fair
to
say
that
by
the
end
of
the
semester
I
had
made
big
strides.
I
acknowledge
that
there
is
always
more
to
learn,
but
I
donut
look
at
this
upcoming
WA
assignment
with
any
concern
regarding
my
ability
to
edit
the
technical
side
of
things.
With
repetition
of
basic
grammar
rules
has
come
a
confidence
that
can
only
make
me
a
better
WA
this
upcoming
year.
Outside
of
achieving
personal
goals,
my
experiences
as
a
WA
have
allowed
me
to
identify
bad
writing.
That
seems
trivial,
but
when
you
see
a
lot
of
the
bad
stuff,
it
is
much
easier
to
weed
it
out
of
your
own
work,
leaving
just
the
good
behind.
Beyond
botched
grammar,
when
papers
were
thrust
at
me
devoid
of
real
argument
p
outside
of
contending
that
a
topic
of
choice
was
rinterestingsp
my
brain
would
put
up
red
flags.
These
little
bad
habits
that
can
be
so
difficult
to
identify
within
our
own
pieces,
as
it
is
too
easy
to
get
attached
to
what
we
create,
were
right
in
front
of
me
and
easy
to
spot.
It
provided
a
world
of
insight
into
what
not
to
do.
I
worked
with
quotes
that
were
not
properly
inserted,
run-on
sentences,
and
topics
that
shifted
into
passive
aggressive
rants
rather
than
valid
arguments.
With
my
edits
on
these
other
papers
came
reflection
about
my
own
work.
After
a
couple
conference
rounds,
when
I
finally
sat
down
to
knock
out
papers
for
my
classes,
I
did
a
ton
of
backspacing.
I
saw
these
habits
right
away,
almost
before
I
could
get
them
all
out
on
paper.
When
my
only
point
is
that
a
topic
is
rinteresting,s
I
have
some
major
reformulating
to
do.
Other
experiences
have
catered
to
slightly
more
creative
aspects
of
my
work,
continuing
to
develop
my
identity
as
a
writer
and
giving
my
work
a
very
clear
tone.
Last
summer,
I
began
a
food
blog
as
a
continuation
of
an
assignment
for
my
food-writing
course
with
Professor
DeTora.
My
blog
has
proven
to
be
my
absolute
favorite
hobby,
and
is
still
going
strong.
At
first
it
was
experimental.
I
didnut
have
a
lot
of
money
to
eat
out,
but
I
had
a
lot
of
opinions
about
food.
My
topics
ranged
from
my
favorite
new
consumer
products
to
references
to
food
in
media.
I
chronicled
my
first
experiences
with
chain
restaurants
Iud
never
been
to
before,
always
finding
a
way
to
integrate
travel
and
what
was
happening
in
my
life.
Over
time,
I
figured
out
what
was
the
most
fun
to
write
about,
and
how
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
was
also
enjoyable
for
others
to
read
without
being
completely
self-serving.
This
is
a
trap
a
lot
of
bloggers
fall
in
to
p
writing
about
your
day
on
the
job
and
posting
pictures
of
your
cat
is
a
technique
that
works
for
only
a
select
amount
of
people.
I
like
to
work
around
this
trap
by
incorporating
friends,
family,
and
media
whenever
possible.
Outside
the
identity
my
food
blog
has
taken
on,
blogging
allows
me
to
be
a
prolific
writer.
I
post
every
couple
days,
sometimes
daily
if
Ium
particularly
inspired.
Even
in
the
relaxed
atmosphere
of
the
Internet,
thinking
about
new
topics
or
ways
to
describe
the
awesome
dessert
I
sampled
while
eating
out
the
other
night
exercises
that
literary
part
of
my
brain,
disallowing
any
dust
to
settle.
My
blog
keeps
me
writing,
which
is
the
very
best
thing
to
do
if
that
is
your
craft,
or
at
least
so
Iuve
been
told.
My
blog
doubled
as
a
travel
guide
for
my
friends
and
family
at
home
while
I
was
abroad.
I
wasnut
just
blogging
about
pizza
anymore,
but
about
the
pizza
I
ate
on
the
Spanish
Steps
in
Rome.
Now
thatus
an
inspired
post!
Chronicling
these
travels
relates
to
the
third
influence
on
my
written
work,
and
that
is
my
experience
outside
of
this
country.
My
semester
abroad
flexed
my
communication
muscles
more
than
anything
else.
I
worked
my
way
through
countries
in
French,
Spanish,
Italian,
German,
and
even
Arabic.
Even
living
in
London
forced
me
to
adjust
to
a
new
vernacular
p
we
truly
are
two
nations
separated
by
a
common
language.
With
each
of
these
different
languages
came
new
colloquialisms
and
new
conversational
norms.
I
love
the
English
language,
but
I
still
think
youud
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
prettier
song
than
La
Mer,
the
French
counterpart
to
Beyond
the
Sea,
or
to
listen
to
a
more
fascinating
reverie
than
a
mosqueus
call
to
prayer
in
Arabic
punctuating
the
day
in
a
Muslim
country.
My
first
time
out
of
America,
my
travels
have
not
only
given
me
more
to
write
about,
but
have
thrust
a
global
perspective
on
to
me.
Being
forced
to
communicate
in
so
many
different
countries
has
given
me
a
greater
appreciation
of
language
in
general,
and
not
just
my
own.
When
I
write
freely,
I
feel
as
if
I
have
much
more
in
my
arsenal.
I
wrote
an
essay
upon
my
return
from
Tunisia
about
the
cultural
shock
I
experienced,
and
I
found
myself
writing
in
the
same
soft,
punctuated
sentences
as
shopkeepers
did
with
me
when
I
was
there.
I
was
taking
on
a
version
of
their
language
in
my
work.
While
the
effects
of
travel
on
my
writing
are
difficult
to
outline,
I
think
the
point
is
that
with
new
cultures
comes
new
perspective
as
well
as
argot.
From
my
London
internship
that
had
me
writing
reports
on
screenplays
every
single
day,
to
learning
how
to
communicate
in
different
tongues,
when
I
put
pen
to
paper
I
do
it
with
both
more
to
say
and
about
a
million
new
ways
to
say
it.
Itus
another
example
of
my
broadened
horizons,
which
is
so
important
in
written
work.
I
took
a
real
liking
to
many
of
the
colloquialisms
used
in
London,
as
I
felt
they
better
described
daily
situations.
I
still
find
myself
using
them
in
my
narratives,
explaining
that
characters
rwere
keens
to
do
something
and
would
eventually
rget
themselves
sorted.s
I
really
wish
those
phrases
would
catch
on
at
home.
In
the
end,
I
have
been
and
always
will
be
a
writer.
This
is
my
craft.
This
is
something
I
will
use
for
the
rest
of
my
life,
and
I
acknowledge
that
it
is
a
dynamic
process.
This
past
year
has
done
wonders
for
my
written
work
from
all
angles
p
my
method,
my
content,
and
even
the
technicalities
of
grammar.
While
being
a
WA
has
no
doubt
played
a
vital
role
in
this
transformation,
I
credit
a
variety
of
sources
with
this
growth.
It
is
the
people,
the
experiences,
and
the
places
I
have
dealt
with
that
have
taken
me
to
this
place.
I
look
forward
to
what
the
next
year
brings
for
both
my
life
and
my
written
work,
but
if
Iuve
learned
anything
as
of
late,
itus
that
separating
the
two
is
often
times
impossible.
