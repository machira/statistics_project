Personal
Literacy
Narrative
There
is
a
stack
of
paper
in
the
desk
drawer
that
sits
under
a
sunny
window
and
the
plants
on
the
third
floor
of
my
house,
in
the
town
I
have
lived
in
since
I
started
writing,
since
I
moved
back
home
from
the
Midwest,
and
since
I
have
wished
I
had
something
to
write
about.
It
is
the
only
copy
I
have
of
my
first
stories,
done
for
school,
but
in
which
I
can
still
remember
the
pride
that
is
lacking
in
so
much
that
I
write
today.
There
is
a
story
done
with
clearly
marked
spelling
words,
clearly
marked
by
their
phonetic
spelling
as
IOd
found
in
the
dictionary,
rather
than
the
actual,
and
a
much
longer
story
about
a
robot
factory,
and
one
on
which
IOd
lost
points
for
spelling
the
adventurerOs
name
NJhonO
instead
of
NJohn.O
They
are,
perhaps,
not
great
stories,
but
I
was
proud
of
them
nonetheless,
as
I
still
am,
though
in
a
way
that
speaks
more
of
a
pride
in
a
younger
self
that
is
distant
and
unconnected
from
my
current
self.
I
am
proud
of
these
stories
because
they
are
clever
and
inventive
for
nine
years
old
and,
though
they
are
not
terribly
interesting
as
singular
entities,
they
were
different
from
what
my
classmates
were
writing,
and
I
consider
them
original
for
what
I
knew.
In
those
stories,
though,
is
something
more
important.
They
are
bits
of
enjoyment
(really,
the
only
pleasure
I
can
remember
out
of
Ms.
BracamonteOs
fourth
grade
class)
and
are
the
first
revelations
that
accompany
the
discovery
of
something
that
comes
naturally.
Moreover,
they
were
accompanied
by
the
first
received
comments
of
praise
that
I
had
ever
considered
genuine,
with
little
consideration
given
to
the
notion
that
they
came
mostly
from
family.
I
recall
proudly
the
moment
I
first
used
a
viable
analogy,
likening
our
neighbors
with
their
constant
renovations
to
a
painter
who
can
never
quite
stop,
and
hearing
my
mother
describe
the
moment
to
a
friend
on
the
phone
through
my
bedroom
door.
Though
expressing
what
I
really
meant
was
difficult,
I
enjoyed
working
at
it,
and
restating
myself,
and
simply
thinking
about
other
realities
in
the
corner
of
the
silver
and
green
kitchen
that
was
so
much
my
reality.
I
enjoyed
starting
stories,
opening
possibilities,
and
I
enjoyed
hearing
the
click,
click,
click
of
my
fingers
on
our
first
computer
keyboard
that
became
my
sound
of
productivity.
Even
as
I
write,
just
now,
the
clicking
fades
into
a
sort
of
pleasant
white
noise
that
reminds
me
of
writing
in
a
warm
kitchen
and
being
young
enough
to
think
that
everything
I
write
is
interesting
and
above-average.
And
I
remember
hoping,
after
that
first
analogy,
that
I
would
be
able
to
someday
produce
something
else
worth
my
motherOs
conversation.
My
later
education
in
writing
did
not
dissuade
me
from
this
adoration,
either.
In
writing
for
school,
I
found
more
than
just
the
wordplay
that
had
first
piqued
my
interest.
As
persuasive
writing
became
the
latest
vogue
with
our
first
standardized
tests
looming
nearer,
I
found
that
the
creation
of
new
worlds
was
less
applicable
than
the
manipulation
of
the
one
I
already
had.
Instead,
writing
became
a
puzzle.
It
seemed
that
if
I
were
clever
enough,
and
logical,
and
well-spoken,
I
could
convince
anyone
of
nearly
anything,
and
I
aimed
to
be
intelligent
enough
to
do
just
that.
It
was
pleasing,
I
recall,
to
have
a
tangible
end
to
my
work;
to
know
that
there
was
a
point
at
which
the
writing
had
achieved
its
goal
of
persuasion,
and
past
which
any
revisions
were
done
entirely
for
my
own
self-improvement.
But
that
meant,
too,
that
writing
was
no
longer
a
journey,
or,
at
least,
the
adventurous
journey
I
had
originally
discovered.
Though
persuasive
writing
was
fun,
it
did
not
provide
me
with
the
same
sweet
pride
that
the
creation
of
stories
always
had,
nor
did
my
schooling
attempt
to
dissuade
this
disillusionment.
Indeed,
as
I
got
older
and
more
learned,
I
discovered
that
a
love
for
writing
was
not
nearly
as
important
as
the
skill
to
do
it,
and
that
it
was
far
more
important
to
appreciate
good
writing
than
to
attempt
it.
When
we
read
Alan
and
Naomi
in
class,
I
was
one
of
the
few
students
who
enjoyed
it,
or
who
was
touched
enough
to
cry
in
all
of
the
proper
places.
It
was
the
first
book
I
had
ever
read
that
left
me
feeling
empty,
rather
than
full,
as
if
there
was
a
hollow
for
something
that
the
characters,
too,
were
missing,
and
so
I
wrote
my
own
ending
in
an
attempt
to
rid
myself
of
that.
I
was
proud
of
this
attempt,
a
simple
one
page
epilogue
to
a
story
that
had
meant
so
much
to
me,
and
I
showed
it
to
a
friend
who
proudly
seized
upon
it
and
read
it
out
loud,
jeering,
to
anyone
who
would
listen.
She
thought
it
was
ridiculous,
and
I
vowed
never
to
share
my
work
again.
The
creations
that
I
had
contrived
in
elementary
school
became
work
for
children
and
the
work
I
had
proudly
created
and
displayed
became
hidden,
as
most
of
it
remains.
And
yet,
I
did
not,
could
not
stop
writing:
it
became
my
panacea.
In
high
school
and
college,
creative
writing
has
been
promoted
only
by
select
teachers
for
limited
periods
of
time.
Writing
for
grades
is
most
often
more
important
than
writing
for
pleasure,
and
so
pleasure
must
take
a
second
seat
next
to
purpose.
If
I
enjoy
the
writing
that
I
do,
it
is
an
added
bonus,
but
very
few
of
the
teachers
that
I
have
strive
to
make
me
enjoy
what
is
already
necessary.
Most
clearly
I
recall
my
first
high
school
history
class
that
required
(the
unthinkable!)
a
full
five
paragraph
essay
per
day.
As
Mr.
Renwick
explained,
it
was
important
for
standardized
testing
to
be
able
to
stamp
out
a
paper
much
as
one
could
stamp
out
a
math
problem.
There
was
a
formula
to
it,
with
the
compulsory
thesis,
backup
evidence,
and
conclusion
statement
that
would
be
used
to
prove
a
control
over
the
English
language.
And
I
recall
thinking,
for
the
first
time,
that
my
education
was
misdirected.
I
did
not
attend
school
to
pass
tests,
but
to
learn.
Years
later,
of
course,
the
skill
of
easy
writing
has,
indeed,
proven
itself
useful,
but
it
was
because
of
the
skill
Mr.
Renwick
gave
me,
namely
to
write
an
entire
essay
in
the
forty
minute
English
class
directly
preceding
his
class,
that
I
began
to
write
for
myself
in
my
free
time,
to
explore
the
real
enjoyment
that
I
had
already
known.
Wanting
to
avoid
the
methodical,
formulaic
nature
of
the
work
I
was
required
to
do
for
his
class,
writing
became
far
more
personal.
Since
I
was
writing
at
my
whim,
writing
became
subject
to
my
whims,
and
as
an
outlet
for
my
moods.
If
I
were
happy,
it
was
reflected
in
the
calm
nature
of
my
writing
and,
if
upset,
was
clearly
used
to
make
my
mind
peaceable
to
a
point
at
which
I
was
willing
to
cope
again.
Even
all
these
years
later,
I
still
rely
on
writing
to
fix
what
has
broken
within
me.
As
I
discovered
the
affinity
I
had
for
writing
it
became,
because
of
its
very
nature,
my
source
to
work
out
puzzles
and
problems,
and
to
express
most
clearly
my
feelings
and
thoughts.
All
of
the
most
important
things
I
have
ever
had
to
describe
to
another
person
have
been
in
writing.
When
I
first
left
for
college,
it
was
only
in
my
postcards
that
I
could
write
NI
miss
youO
to
the
people
I
loved
and
have
myself
believe
it.
I
began
to
write
vignettes,
too,
of
people
who
were
like
me,
in
the
same
situation
I
was
in,
and
dealing
with
it
far
better
than
I.
They
were,
as
my
first
stories
had
been,
the
start
of
a
story,
and
nothing
more
than
an
idea,
inspired
mainly
by
an
object
or
a
color
or
a
texture,
and
created
around
a
mood.
My
only
result
from
this
phase
is
a
single
document
on
my
hard
drive
numbering
nearly
seventy
pages
of
single
paragraphs
having
no
relation
to
any
others.
Often
enough,
reading
through
them,
I
began
to
covet
more
of
a
story,
as
one
does
when
one
reads
an
excerpt
from
an
intriguing
a
novel.
It
was
at
this
point,
then,
at
the
beginning
of
college,
that
I
realized
my
stories
had
become
detached
from
me.
There
were
paragraphs
that
I
could
not
recall
writing
at
all,
and
those
that
I
could
recall
were
somehow
detached
from
me,
written
in
a
different
mood
and,
therefore,
by
a
different
person.
I
was
not
able
to
return
to
them
to
extend
them,
and
still
cannot.
They
are,
instead,
lost
bits
of
unraveled
problems
floating
disconnected
in
a
sea
of
isolated
words.
Sitting
in
front
of
my
computer,
reading
through
this
exceedingly
long
document,
it
was
at
this
point
that
I,
sometime
toward
the
end
of
my
freshman
year,
realized
that
I
would
never
quite
be
a
writer.
I
could
not
write
stories
with
beginnings
and
ends.
In
spite
of
all
my
essay-training,
my
beloved
writing
would
not
become
writing
to
be
read,
but
writing
for
its
own
sake.
I
wrote
solely
for
me,
and,
finally,
became
okay
with
that.
More
than
any
other
activity,
I
began
to
equate
writing
with
a
sense
of
calm,
of
feeling
better,
and
of
being
better,
after
having
worked
through
whatever
had
encumbered
me.
Nothing
was
so
bad
that
writing
could
not
fix:
if
I
could
describe
it
and
make
it
tangible,
it
was
no
longer
the
abstract
notion
of
NproblemO
or
Ndifficulty,O
but
a
situation
with
constraints
that
could
be
discovered
and
manipulated
and
reconfigured
to
work.
It
was
that
same
day,
watching
the
endless
screen
blankly,
that
I
decided
I
had
to
do
something
else
with
writing.
As
consciously
as
I
state
it
here,
however,
writing
has
always
been
intuitive
for
me.
When
writing
for
school
became
a
necessity,
I
wrote
in
my
own
free
time
because
I
sensed
that
it
would
fill
a
part
of
me
that
had
become
suddenly
empty.
I
did
not
set
out
to
work
at
writing,
and
to
create
something
over
which
I
could
later
read
for
pleasure.
I
wrote
for
the
moment,
for
the
ephemeral
emotion
that
needed
escape
from
within
me.
When
I
got
to
the
age
at
which
Gertrude
Stein
became
a
recognizable
figure
(as
late
as
this
past
summer
in
Paris),
and
when
I
learned
how
she
wrote,
trusting
in
her
own
abilities
to
create,
and
creating
for
her
own
sake,
I
became
personally
affronted
when
criticism
was
aimed
at
her,
because
that
is
how
I
write.
I
had
very
little
to
add
to
the
discussions
about
her
style
because,
though
Ernest
Hemingway
manages
to
describe
her
style
of
writing
as
distinctly
childish,
I
could
not
disparage
the
only
person
I
have
ever
trusted
as
my
writing
kin.
Granted,
my
finished
products
do
not
generally
fall
into
the
category
of
genius,
but
it
is
the
same
process,
the
same
action,
the
same
verb:
to
write,
and
with
the
same
connotation.
I,
too,
trust
in
myself
to
know
what
needs
to
be
written,
and
to
do
it
correctly
for
that
which
I
need
it.
While
a
group
of
intelligent,
knowledgeable,
worldly
college
students
and
their
professors
chided
Stein
around
me,
I
grasped
at
the
beauty
with
which
her
work
was
created
and
kept
my
stubborn
convictions
to
myself.
And
so
it
was,
when
my
next
door
neighbor
approached
me
boldly
and
asked
me
to
read
her
freshly
written
paper
and
to
edit
it,
it
was
my
intuition
that
led
me
to
realize
that,
although
I
might
never
be
able
to
spend
time
revising
my
own
work,
I
could
do
the
very
same
for
others,
and
could
believe
that
I
was
doing
something
valuable.
Because
of
what
writing
means
to
me,
however,
I
am
nearly
always
unwilling
to
receive
criticism.
Much
of
my
writing
was
not
written
for
the
purpose
of
entertainment,
and
so
I
feel
that
that
writing,
at
least,
ought
to
be
exempt
from
critique
of
plot
or
character
or
story.
Usually
it
is,
simply
because
I
do
not
often
share
my
work.
Additionally,
I
find,
I
am
unwilling
to
receive
criticism
from
other
writers
whose
work
I
disparage.
Most
likely,
it
is
a
major
roadblock
in
the
improvement
of
my
own
writing,
but
I
cannot
bring
myself
to
respect
the
opinions
on
writing
of
someone
whose
own
writing
I
cannot
respect
for
its
similar
flaws.
Moreover,
I
do
not
have
patience
at
all
for
opinions
of
my
writing
from
those
who
do
not
read
themselves,
whether
it
be
praise
or
criticism.
I
cannot
take
seriously
the
comments
of
someone
who
has
not
learned
the
basics
of
the
craft
and
utilized
the
building
blocks
of
the
language.
I
will
always
write.
I
do
not
know
if
there
is
anything
that
can
ever
quite
take
the
place
of
what
writing
does
for
me,
and
I
do
not
intend
to
seek
it.
That
said,
I
do
not
set
out
with
purpose
of
becoming
a
writer
to
make
my
livelihood.
Writing
is
too
personal
a
thing
for
me
to
write
for
anotherOs
enjoyment,
or
to
do
it
for
the
sake
of
creation.
I
am
happy
with
the
craft
of
my
words
and
the
process
of
creating
something
that
pleases
me
alone
and
fulfills
a
purpose
that
I
need.
I
have
come
to
a
place
where
I
want
to,
instead,
give
others
the
pleasure
of
creating
something
in
which
they
can
have
pride.
I
want
others
to
be
able
to
share
in
the
personal
joy
that
I
feel
at
having
learned
to
manipulate
oneOs
language
to
suit
oneOs
whim.
I
want
to
give
other
people
the
tools
that
I
know
and
use
in
my
own
writing
to
improve
it.
I
am
not
a
brilliant
writer,
and
I
may
never
be,
but
I
hope,
in
just
the
smallest
way,
that
I
can
promote
an
appreciation
for
writing,
and
provide
the
skills
to
start
anyone
on
their
way,
or
to
motivate
and
strengthen
an
already
held
adoration.
