A
Narrative
On
My
History
As
A
Writer
22
August
1996
In
order
to
construct
a
history
of
myself
as
a
writer,
I
went
back
and
looked
at
samples
of
my
writing
that
either
I
or
my
parents
had
saved
over
the
years.
I
considered
a
wide
variety
of
my
writing
efforts,
including
elementary
school
essays,
high
school
term
papers,
and
college
research
papers.
As
I
reread
my
work,
I
was
able
to
observe
my
growth
and
development
as
a
writer.
I
have
chosen
a
series
of
experiences
that
I
think
best
illustrate
this
development.
The
earliest
writing
samples
I
considered
were
written
when
I
was
about
six
or
seven.
They
were
mainly
notes
to
family,
written
haphazardly
in
marker
on
wide
ruled
notebook
paper.
This
sort
of
writing
was
used
mainly
as
an
outlet
for
feeling,
and
many
of
these
notes
included
phrases
like
I'm
sorry
or
I
love
you
.
Even
at
an
early
age,
I
tried
to
use
writing
to
express
my
most
important
feelings,
or
to
organize
and
share
thoughts
that
might
have
been
hard
to
talk
about.
For
example,
one
letter
reads:
Dear
Mom,
I've
been
doing
a
lot
of
things
that
make
me
feel
pretty
special...but
I
don't
get
any
thanks
for
it!
I
wrote
this
with
the
understanding
that
my
intended
audience,
specifically
my
mother,
would
take
note
of
my
frustration
and
would
be
more
able
to
understand
my
feelings.
My
parents
encouraged
me
to
write
in
this
fashion
by
praising
my
work.
My
best
stories
and
letters
were
always
proudly
displayed
on
the
refridgerator
door.
Oddly
enough,
my
letters
were
very
well
written
in
terms
of
their
organization.
Although
the
lines
sloped
crazily
off
the
page,
and
the
thoughts
ran
together
confusingly
(a
result
of
minimal
punctuation),
each
one
starts
with
a
heading
(usually
Dear
Man
),
and
ends
with
a
closing
statement
such
as
From
your
daughter,
Beth
.
In
addition,
I
would
always
begin
with
a
statement
of
purpose
such
as
I
want
to
explain
why
I
yelled
at
Jill
today.
Even
at
an
early
age,
I
had
a
sense
that
I
needed
to
keep
my
thoughts
organized.
My
elementary
school
writing
was
a
great
deal
different
from
the
work
I
did
at
hone.
The
demands
of
elementary
school
writing
proved
to
be
somewhat
of
a
shock,
since
suddenly
my
papers
were
not
just
appreciated
and
tacked
on
the
refridgerator,
they
were
also
graded.
At
the
age
of
twelve,
I
was
very
eager
to
please
my
teachers,
and
I
tended
to
take
their
criticism
of
my
writing
personally.
Sometimes
I
would
come
home
in
tears,
discouraged
and
upset
by
the
quantity
of
red
ink
on
my
papers.
My
difficulties
with
criticism
lessened
after
taking
a
junior
high
school
class
in
creative
writing.
The
students
would
write
their
stories
at
hone,
and
then
bring
them
to
class,
where
they
would
be
exchanged
with
those
of
a
partner.
Each
student
would
offer
constructive
suggestions
to
his
or
her
partner
on
how
to
improve
the
organizational
or
grammatical
aspects
of
their
work.
After
exchanging
suggestions
with
other
students,
I
began
to
understand
that
all
criticism
was
not
bad,
and
that
I
could
use
constructive
criticism
to
improve
my
writing.
I
began
writing
my
first
serious
papers
while
in
junior
high
school.
During
this
period
of
time
I
took
part
in
a
special
school
program
that
involved
spending
a
semester
studying
a
chosen
topic
and
then
preparing
a
presentation
and
a
paper
on
it.
I
chose
NASA
and
America's
space
program,
and
I
studied
NASA's
history
for
months.
When
the
time
came
to
prepare
the
paper,
I
was
extremely
knowledgeable
about
NASA,
but
I
had
trouble
organizing
my
thoughts
in
order
to
write
a
paper.
My
first
draft
was
a
mess.
Aside
from
the
introductory
and
concluding
paragraphs,
the
paper
was
just
ten
solid
pages
of
jumbled
information.
After
reading
it,
my
teacher
asked
me
if
I
wanted
help
formulating
an
outline
on
my
topic.
She
told
me
that
no
matter
how
much
I
knew,
I
would
not
be
able
to
share
it
effectively
with
others
unless
my
thoughts
were
organized.
With
the
help
of
my
outline,
the
paper
became
more
organized,
and
I
was
better
able
to
prepare
myself
for
my
oral
presentation
on
my
topic.
I
hated
public
speaking,
and
I
stumbled
through
my
presentation,
mumbling
my
prepared
speech
and
staring
at
the
floor.
When
I
received
my
grade
for
my
presentation,
it
was
accompanied
by
a
note
from
my
teacher.
She
said
that
my
voice
needed
to
be
clear
and
loud
for
others
to
understand
me,
and
that
my
arguments
would
have
been
more
believable
had
I
spoken
with
authority.
At
the
time
I
was
confused;
what
did
a
strong,
authoritative
voice
have
to
do
with
the
success
of
my
research
paper?
After
years
of
writing
research
papers,
I'm
starting
to
understand
the
value
of
her
words.
In
writing,
as
in
speaking,
I
had
to
learn
to
make
clear
arguments
with
strong
examples
in
order
to
get
my
point
across.
Nobody
would
pay
serious
attention
to
my
work,
no
matter
what
I
was
saying,
if
the
organizational
and
technical
aspects
of
my
paper
were
poorly
prepared;
I
knew
from
personal
experience
that
less
attention
was
paid
to
the
words
of
people
who
spoke
incorrectly,
or
unclearly.
My
experience
with
my
first
oral
presentation
had
shown
me
that
the
same
was
true
for
writing.
My
writing
improved
a
good
deal
in
junior
high,
but
the
majority
of
my
growth
as
a
writer
occured
in
high
school.
I
attended
Catholic
high
school,
and
was
therefore
inundated
with
Classical
literature.
My
papers
became
analyses
of
the
work
of
authors
such
as
Virgil
and
Homer,
instead
of
research
papers
like
my
NASA
assignment.
Although
this
was
new
territory
for
me,
I
liked
it,
and
I
enjoyed
reading
a
story
or
a
poem,
and
then
formulating
a
thesis
and
writing
a
paper.
My
biggest
challenge
in
high
school
was
the
essay
question.
Instead
of
a
paper
with
an
outline,
a
draft,
and
a
final
product,
I
was
suddenly
confronted
with
a
question
on
an
exam
and
a
limited
amount
of
time
to
answer
it.
In
addition,
these
questions
usually
required
me
to
formulate
a
miniature
thesis
at
the
beginning,
and
then
prove
my
statement
with
examples.
Every
question
ended
with
a
statement
such
as
support
your
opinion
with
concrete
examples
from
the
story.
My
first
reaction
to
these
questions
was
panic.
The
thoughts
rushed
directly
from
my
head
to
the
paper
in
a
disorderly
fashion.
My
papers
came
back
with
commments
like
You
have
to
prove
this
and
Give
me
examples
on
them.
By
the
end
of
the
semester
I
figured
out
a
method
to
answer
these
questions
better.
I
would
scribble
a
rough
outline
of
my
points
with
their
corresponding
examples
in
the
margin.
"Since
I
had
already
written
down
what
I
wanted
to
say,
I
could
relax
a
little
and
concentrate
on
my
organization.
This
process
still
works
for
me,
although
I
always
feel
a
flutter
of
nervousness
when
confronted
with
an
essay
question
on
an
exam.
I
also
took
a
religion
class
that
required
each
student
to
maintain
a
journal.
These
were
occasionally
read
(but
never
corrected)
by
the
teacher.
This
was
a
unique
writing
experience
for
me
because
it
was
unbound
by
any
parameters
for
length,
subject
matter,
or
organization.
I
just
wrote
about
how
I
was
feeling,
or
about
things
that
were
going
on
in
my
life.
My
teacher
would
comment
at
the
end
of
each
entry,
and
she
usually
would
write
supporting
messages
intended
to
serve
as
encouragement.
It
felt
strange
to
write
without
worrying
about
paragraphs,
or
whether
or
not
my
thoughts
were
joined
by
transitional
sentences,
but
it
also
felt
good
to
express
myself
freely.
By
the
time
I
became
a
senior,
my
teachers
were
giving
what
they
called
college
style
writing
assignments.
I
became
acquainted
with
a
series
of
confusing
documentation
methods,
and
began
doing
a
lot
of
serious
research.
My
teachers
seemed
to
synchronize
their
assignments
so
that
I
always
had
at
least
two
papers
to
work
on
during
the
entire
year.
I
decided
that
if
these
assignments
were
previews
of
college
work,
I'd
better
be
able
to
handle
them,
or
elso
I'd
be
doomed
in
the
fall.
I
began
my
research
work
with
more
fear
than
enthusiasm.
Every
day
at
lunch,
I'd
do
research
for
my
physics
paper
on
gravity
and
black
holes,
and
then
at
night
I
would
read
up
on
literary
criticism
of
Beowulf
for
my
British
Literature
paper.
Looking
back
at
these
papers,
I
was
impressed
by
their
good
organization
and
their
directness.
I
was
also
amazed
by
how
much
my
high
school
teachers
demanded
of
me.
At
the
time,
I
felt
as
if
they
were
asking
more
than
I
could
give,
but
looking
back,
I
can
see
how
well
these
assignments
prepared
me
for
college
writing.
College
writing
was
not
as
difficult
as
I
had
expected
it
to
be.
This
was
partially
due
to
the
fact
that
I
had
heard
about
college
writing
from
my
high
school
teachers
for
so
long
that
I
had
begun
to
envision
it
as
something
that
no
normal
student
could
possibly
handle.
The
professors
did
have
high
standards
for
writing
quality,
but
the
writing
I
had
been
assigned
in
high
school
had
prepared
me
pretty
well.
That
does
not
mean
that
I
did
not
have
any
writing
difficulties
in
college.
One
thing
I
was
not
prepared
for
were
the
writing
assignments
I
received
in
my
laboratory
courses.
Aside
from
my
FYS,
my
first
year
courseload
included
Chemistry,
Biology,
and
Calculus,
and
thoughtful
writing
was
required
in
each
class.
Lab
reports
became
my
most
time
consuming
assignments,
and
I
struggled
to
master
the
stiff
formats
and
and
vocabulary
that
technical
writing
requires.
Many
times,
the
subject
matter
of
the
lab
report
was
still
a
mystery
to
me
even
after
I
had
performed
the
lab,
and
I
would
dread
the
writeup
because
I
knew
I
would
have
to
figure
out
what
had
been
happening
in
the
lab
before
I
could
begin.
Too
often,
I
would
bumble
through
the
entire
report
by
using
big
words
and
ambiguous
explanations.
I
knew
I
wasn't
alone
in
my
confusion,
but
I
felt
alone
when
my
lab
reports
came
back
with
comments
on
them
saying:
You
really
didn't
get
the
point
of
this
lab.
My
FYS
and
FYW
served
as
comfort
zones
for
me
during
my
first
year,
when
the
writing
styles
required
by
other
classes
were
still
new
and
different.
Both
my
FYS
and
my
FYW
were
about
poetry,
and
this
was
a
topic
that
I
had
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
writing
about
in
high
school
so
I
felt
confident
that
I
could
write
a
good
paper
about
poetry.
I
was
somewhat
put
off
by
the
numerous
drafts
required
before
the
final
draft
was
subnitted,
however.
I
was
the
type
of
writer
who
worked
hard
on
the
first
draft,
and
considered
it
to
be
as
close
to
perfection
as
it
would
ever
get.
I
was
very
reluctant
to
make
any
changes
in
my
work.
My
inflexibility
was,
of
course,
counter
to
the
point
of
my
FYS.
We
were
supposed
to
be
learning
to
rework
our
writing
through
a
series
of
drafts.
I
remember
sitting
with
my
WA
and
asking
if
I
really
had
to
move
paragraphs
around,
when
my
paper
looked
and
sounded
fine
to
me
the
way
it
was.
I
was
reluctant
to
make
changes
in
my
drafts
unless
they
were
to
correct
grammatical
errors
or
spelling.
It
took
me
a
semester
to
realize
that
I
was
making
it
harder
on
myself
by
trying
to
create
a
perfect
paper
on
my
first
draft.
I
began
to
use
the
first
draft
to
try
out
my
ideas
for
my
paper,
rather
than
trying
to
immediately
develop
my
thoughts
to
their
fullest.
In
my
second
draft,
I
could
remove
topics
that
didn't
seem
to
fit
and
build
upon
the
parts
of
my
first
draft
that
were
more
interesting
or
relevant
to
the
topic.
On
the
final
draft,
I
would
complete
and
perfect
the
technical
aspects
of
the
paper.
I
also
developed
a
habit
of
rewriting
my
introduction
and
conclusion
for
my
final
draft,
since
usually
the
paper
had
undergone
enough
of
a
change
that
my
original
introduction
and
conclusion
did
not
fit
the
paper
as
well
anymore.
By
my
second
year,
I
was
using
this
method
almost
exclusively,
because
it
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
carefully
choose
the
best
aspects
of
my
paper
to
expound
on,
and
which
to
remove.
I
still
use
this
technique
today
since
it
seems
to
keep
me
open
to
suggestions,
yet
organized
and
focused
on
my
topic.
Now,
entering
my
Junior
year
in
college,
I
can
say
that
I
enjoy
writing.
I
feel
a
lot
of
satisfaction
when
I
hand
in
the
final
draft
of
a
paper,
because
most
of
the
time
I
know
that
I
have
done
my
best.
I
always
put
a
lot
of
thought
into
what
I
say
in
papers,
and
how
I
say
it.
Since
I
started
school
at
Lafayette,
I've
become
more
open
to
constructive
criticism
and
a
lot
more
organized
and
efficient
when
writing.
I
think
these
changes
have
improved
the
quality
of
my
writing
tremendously.
I
still
have
many
writing
difficulties
(most
involve
lab
reports),
but
the
way
I
look
at
it,
that
means
that
I
am
still
growing
and
developing
as
a
writer.
After
writing
this
paper,
I
can
see
how
my
writing
has
developed
and
matured
over
the
years.
My
writing
is
much
different
now
than
it
was
when
I
began
so
many
years
ago.
I
started
out
as
an
eager
child
who
wanted
to
use
written
words
to
communicate
with
her
family.
Today
I
am
still
using
writing
to
communicate
my
thoughts,
but
my
audience
is
much
wider.
As
a
result,
my
writing
has
become
an
important
indicator
of
who
I
am.
The
events
I
have
described
here
have
helped
to
shape
me
into
the
writer
that
I
am
today.
