The
Write
Stuff:
A
Literary
History
of
Human
beings
have
five
senses:
taste,
touch,
sight,
smell
and
hearing.
As
a
child
I
suffered
from
severe
ear
infections,
and
consequently,
my
hearing
was
slightly
damaged.
As
a
child
my
mother
would
read
to
me
and
I
would
have
to
pay
close
attention
to
the
words
she
read
to
understand
stories.
At
a
very
young
age
I
had
a
deep
appreciation
for
language
and
the
ability
to
communicate
with
other
people.
Words
were
strange
and
mystical;
and
if
I
couldn't
understand
what
people
said
I
could
always
turn
to
print.
Soon,
I
began
to
read
and
then
to
write.
My
literary
career
was
born.
My
first
attempts
at
writing
were
to
make
copies
of
the
books
I
read
with
my
crayons
and
pencil.
I
would
change
a
few
details
from
the
stories
so
that
I
was
not
merely
copying
the
book
like
a
Xerox
machine.
When
I
was
finished
with
my
book
I
would
staple
the
pages
together
and
add
the
book
to
my
collection.
I
had
few
toys,
so
books
were
my
primary
entertainment.
Re-writing
books
would
amuse
me
for
hours
because
I
could
change
whatever
I
did
not
like
about
a
story.
Thus,
at
a
young
age
an
editor
was
born.
I
entered
school
already
knowing
how
to
read
and
write.
After
first
grade
I
added
finger-painting
and
clay
molding
to
my
resumee
but
school
had
done
little
to
encourage
writing.
My
second
and
third
grade
teachers,
Ms.
Garvey
and
Ms.
Callahan,
respectively,
had
the
biggest
impact
on
my
life
in
terms
of
fostering
my
interest
in
creative
writing.
Each
member
of
their
class
kept
their
own
journal
and
every
day
for
15-20
minutes
we
would
write
entries
on
a
chosen
topic.
The
topics
ranged
from
the
silly
("What
would
you
do
if
you
were
a
hotdog?)
to
the
serious
("If
you
met
the
President
of
the
United
States,
what
would
you
say?).
Both
of
these
teachers
instilled
in
me
a
true
love
of
writing.
For
the
first
time
I
was
challenged
to
use
my
imagination
and
I
could
tell
my
own
stories,
no
matter
how
outrageous
they
were.
A
blank
piece
of
paper
became
my
canvas
and
words
were
my
colors
and
brush
strokes.
Both
teachers
always
had
positive
comments
about
my
writing,
yet
if
I
did
not
write
an
entry
to
the
best
of
my
ability,
my
teachers
commented
frankly
about
it.
I
think
having
an
honest
adult
critic
is
the
best
learning
experience
a
child
can
have.
If
I
had
been
excused
for
doing
a
half-hearted
job
I
never
would
have
learned
to
be
self-motivated
and
I
would
have
spent
my
life
just
getting
by
on
good
enough
instead
of
striving
to
always
do
a
little
better
each
time
I
engage
in
an
activity.
After
third
grade
I
lost
interest
in
creative
writing.
I
lacked
adult
direction
and
I
had
a
hard
time
conceiving
ideas
and
letting
them
grow
up.
My
ideas
always
seemed
to
die
in
their
infancy
and
it
was
frustrating
not
knowing
how
to
nurture
and
develop
these
ideas.
I
did
enjoy
reading
books
and
then
adapting
them
into
plays
or
movies.
If
the
groundwork
was
already
in
place
I
had
no
trouble
taking
it
from
there
and
developing
it.
When
I
was
11
I
began
to
keep
a
journal.
My
early
entries
were
more
about
other
people
and
my
interactions
with
them
than
about
me
and
how
I
felt
about
my
life.
Although
it
has
taken
me
a
long
time
to
be
truly
honest
with
myself,
journal
writing
has
helped
me
organize
my
thoughts
and
helped
me
work
my
way
through
unhappy
situations.
By
keeping
all
of
my
old
journals
I
can
see
how
I
have
evolved
as
a
person
(however,
my
handwriting
has
changed
little).
My
journals
are
my
biography
and
my
legacy;
memories
fade,
words
are
eternal.
A
writing
medium
that
I
learned
in
middle
school
was
the
lost
art
of
letter
writing.
I
had
few
friends
in
middle
school,
I
just
was
not
interested
in
going
to
the
mall
or
engaging
in
other
teen-age
activities.
Instead
I
sought
my
friends
through
a
pen
pal
organization.
At
one
point
in
my
life
I
had
a
pen
pal
in
every
continent
(except
Antarctica)
and
we
wrote
with
great
frequency.
Writing
to
people
my
own
age
who
lived
in
different
countries
exposed
me
to
a
variety
of
cultures.
I
learned
many
slang
expressions
and
alternative
spellings
to
words.
No
feeling
in
the
word
was
as
thrilling
as
coming
home
from
school
and
finding
a
letter
addressed
to
me.
The
thrill
came
from
my
ability
to
communicate
with
people
on
a
global
scale.
Middle
school
was
also
where
I
had
my
first
exposure
to
scientific
writing.
The
middle
school
had
a
science
fair.
I
had
never
worked
on
a
project
like
this
before
where
I
had
to
research
a
topic,
do
my
own
experiment
or
model,
and
then
present
what
I
had
learned
to
another
person.
I
loved
the
entire
process!
I
felt
like
a
young
Sherlock
Holmes,
hunting
down
facts
from
at
least
a
dozen
different
sources,
picking
and
choosing
my
information
and
then
piecing
everything
together
like
a
giant
jigsaw
puzzle.
When
I
wrote
my
first
science
fair
report
on
a
typewriter
I
felt
like
a
real
scientist;
and
at
the
same
time
I
felt
like
a
novelist.
My
report
was
organized
into
chapters
and
it
had
an
introduction
and
conclusion
as
well
as
my
own
stories
and
examples
to
illustrate
concepts.
It
was
the
perfect
marriage
of
fact
with
fiction.
I
won
the
science
fair
that
year
and
the
year
after
that.
I
competed
in
several
regional
and
state
science
fairs
all
through
high
school.
Lacking
in
artistic
ability,
I
focused
all
my
energy
into
researching
my
topic,
writing
the
report
and
presenting
the
topic.
Looking
back
now,
my
reports
had
a
lot
of
passion,
but
were
not
truly
scientific.
The
papers
had
every
imaginable
fact
in
them
and
several
detailed
examples,
everything
except
the
kitchen
sink.
It
was
when
I
came
to
college
that
I
truly
learned
how
a
scientific
paper
is
written,
and
how
a
laboratory
report
is
written.
Never
have
I
had
to
say
so
much
using
as
few
words
as
possible.
Middle
school
was
also
the
place
where
I
began
to
learn
the
more
complex
rules
of
grammar
I
also
learned
how
to
do
a
bibliography
and
how
to
footnote
report.
I
always
had
a
hard
time
grasping
the
concept
of
citing
sources
because
each
teacher
had
a
different
method
for
citing
sources.
Some
teachers
wanted
footnotes,
others
wanted
end
notes.
In
college
I
learned
how
to
cite
sources
within
the
text,
this
was
mostly
for
my
science
classes.
In
high
school
I
returned
to
creative
writing.
I
was
editor
of
the
school
literary
magazine
for
two
years
and
also
the
editor-in-chief
of
the
school
newspaper
for
two
years
as
well.
I
printed
some
poetry
and
short
stories,
most
of
which
were
not
very
good.
However,
one
episode
stood
out
in
my
mind.
My
English
teacher
offered
extra
credit
to
students
if
they
used
all
of
the
weekly
vocabulary
words
in
a
short
story.
I
wrote
a
humorous
story
about
Julia
Child
which
was
printed
in
the
literary
magazine,
(a
copy
of
the
magazine
was
sent
to
Julia
Child
and
she
wrote
a
letter
back
to
me.
That
was
my
one
and
only
brush
with
fame.
High
school
was
also
the
place
where
I
was
exposed
to
another
writing
medium-journalism.
When
I
was
a
sophomore
in
high
school
X
spotted
an
advertisement
in
a
local
paper,
the
Advocate,
that
had
just
started.
The
advertisement
was
for
a
high
school
correspondent.
I
went
to
the
interview
clutching
a
few
writing
samples
and
was
hired
that
week.
I
suspected
that
I
was
hired
because
no
one
else
applied
for
the
job.
I
wrote
my
first
column
about
the
high
school's
foreign
exchange
with
Spain
and
France.
It
was
so
much
fun
making
up
my
own
questions
and
interviewing
people.
I
enjoyed
the
creative
control
I
had
over
my
column.
My
editor
and
I
always
discussed
several
potential
topics
and
then
I
was
free
to
do
whatever
I
wanted
to
do
for
the
column.
When
my
article,
along
with
a
by-line
and
my
photo,
appeared
in
print
I
was
on
top
of
the
world.
Soon
the
editor
asked
me
to
write
articles
that
were
not
related
to
school.
I
also
got
a
few
pieces
of
fan
mail
and
calls
regarding
my
column.
Through
writing
a
column
I
regained
confidence
in
my
ability
to
write
creatively.
What
was
valuable
about
my
experiences
working
as
a
journalist
was
learning
how
to
write
as
a
journalist.
I
knew
my
who's,
what's,
when's,
where's
and
why's;
I
had
to
learn
how
to
write
from
a
detached
point
of
view
and
how
to
be
non-biased.
I
learned
how
to
be
invisible
as
a
writer
and
let
the
story
speak
for
itself
instead
of
inserting
my
two
cents.
I
also
picked
up
the
proper
grammar
and
verb
tenses
to
use
depending
on
the
article.
I'm
still
an
active
journalist.
I
continue
to
work
as
a
free-lance
journalist
for
the
Advocate
and
I
free-lance
for
the
school
newspaper,
the
Lafayette.
When
I
graduated
from
high
school
and
ventured
to
college,
I
confident
in
my
foundation
as
a
writer
in
several
different
genres
and
I
was
prepared
to
learn
several
more.
I
did
have
a
lot
to
learn
especially
in
the
finer
points
of
language
and
grammar.
Another
way
in
which
I
have
evolved
as
a
writer
is
I
have
learned
how
to
be
more
direct
and
to
the
point
in
my
writing.
As
a
writer
I
am
constantly
evolving
and
seeking
to
refine
my
style
as
a
writer
no
matter
which
genre
I
am
writing
in.
Language
and
the
ability
to
communicate
is
one
of
the
greatest
gifts
that
humans
have.
With
the
power
of
language
I
am
not
only
a
writer-I
am
a
creator,
a
storyteller,
a
historian,
a
dreamer,
the
past,
the
present
and
the
future.
