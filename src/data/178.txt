Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative
8/28/1998
"Whenever
you
feel
like
criticizing
any
one...just
remember
that
all
the
people
in
this
world
haven't
had
the
advantages
that
you've
had."
F.
Scott
Fitzgerald,
The
Great
Gatsbv
Here
I
am,
ready
to
embark
on
my
third
and
final
year
as
a
Writing
Associate.
In
certain
ways
I
feel
like
a
veteran,
(well,
I
am)
and
in
others
I
feel
just
like
I
felt
two
years
ago
-
like
an
absolute
novice.
What
lies
behind
me
are
two
years
of
experience,
both
positive
and
negative,
and
the
"been
there,
done
that"
feeling.
After
four
semesters,
each
one
more
different
than
the
other,
I
can
definitely
say
I
have
been
through
a
lot
as
a
WA.
And
still,
there
is
the
apprehension,
the
butterflies
in
my
stomach,
the
excitement
and
anticipation
of
dealing
with
new
writers,
and
with
a
professor
who
has
never
taught
writing
or
used
a
WA
before.
Even
though
I
can
anticipate
and
plan
all
I
want,
what
lies
in
front
of
me
is
still
unknown.
However,
there
is
one
thing
I
can
be
certain
about
-that
my
WA
experience
has
definitely
changed
me,
my
writing,
and
my
Lafayette
College
experience
as
a
whole.
I
can
sit
here
and
tell
you
all
I
want
about
what
a
profound
impact
being
a
WA
has
had
on
my
own
writing,
and
I
wouldn't
be
lying
or
exaggerating.
My
writing
has
improved
tremendously
in
the
past
two
years
for
four
simple
reasons.
I
have
become
more
aware
of
my
own
writing,
I
have
stopped
taking
it
for
granted,
I
can
switch
from
a
"writer
mode"
to
a
"WA
mode"
and
be
my
own
WA
whenever
I
need
to,
and
if
that
doesn't
work,
I
know
about
fifty
people
I
can
turn
to
and
trust
to
give
me
good
advice
about
my
writing.
Even
this
past
year,
when
I
was
in
a
"writing
draught"
compared
to
every
other
year
in
my
college
career,
due
to
my
WA
experience
I
was
so
immersed
in
writing
issues
that
I
didn't
feel
like
my
writing
skills
deteriorated
at
all.
Being
a
WA
does
keep
you
on
the
cutting
edge
of
college
writing
(I
think
this
is
our
most
underrated
job
perk).
My
WA
experience
was
instrumental
to
my
Technology
Clinic
team,
where
well-written,
clear,
and
well-polished
mid-year
and
final
reports
were
crucial
to
the
success
of
the
project
and
to
the
image
we
portrayed
to
our
clients.
Most
of
my
writing
in
the
past
year
was
done
in
French,
a
language
in
which
I
am
not
as
fluent
as
I
am
in
English,
and
that
made
writing
in
it
way
more
frustrating.
Not
only
did
I
have
to
deal
with
issues
such
as
clarity,
logic
and
organization,
but
also
with
grammar,
meaning,
usage,
and
the
"I
know
what
I
want
to
say,
but
I
can't
say
it
in
writing"
phenomenon.
Even
in
this
situation
my
experience
as
a
WA
came
to
the
rescue.
I
knew
how
to
separate
higher
order
concerns
from
lower
order
concerns,
as
well
as
how
to
address
each
kind,
and
I
saved
my
sanity
many
times.
The
majority
of
the
WA-impact
on
my
writing,
however,
occurred
during
my
sophomore
year
since
a
lot
of
the
classes
I
took
then
involved
extensive
writing.
I
could
take
the
lessons
I
learned
as
a
WA
and
apply
them
to
my
own
writing
experience
every
day.
This
was
the
year
that
I
grew
the
most
as
a
writer,
and
I
related
all
this
in
last
year's
narrative.
My
junior
year,
however,
was
different.
I
had
a
ton
of
Math
major
requirements
to
fulfill,
and,
you
guessed
it,
there
was
not
that
much
writing.
Don't
get
me
wrong,
mathematicians
write
a
lot
more
than
you
think.
Nowhere
have
I
found
as
acute
of
a
need
for
clear,
concise,
and
logical
writing
as
in
mathematical
proofs.
It
is
just
not
what
you
would
term
exciting
writing,
because
the
"excitement"
in
a
math
proof
comes
from
the
ideas
expressed
rather
than
from
the
way
you
express
them.
Still,
writing
up
a
proof
can
be
quite
hard
since
in
Math
there
is
no
room
for
"fluff',
which
is
a
lot
harder
to
do
than
it
sounds.
My
European
educational
background
had
trained
me
in
proof
writing
from
the
time
I
was
in
junior
high,
so
I
never
had
any
trouble
with
it.
Still,
I
felt
myself
writing
better
proofs,
and
mastering
the
lingo
of
the
particular
branch
of
Mathematics
as
the
semesters
went
on.
With
so
little
writing
under
my
belt
this
past
year,
my
WA-induced
growth
did
not
manifest
itself
so
much
in
my
writing
as
in
other
areas
of
both
my
WA-life
and
personal
life.
Moreover,
the
more
I
reflect
on
it,
the
more
I
realize
that
the
most
valuable
fruits
I
reaped
from
my
WA
experience
were
not
really
writing-related
(hence,
the
Great
Gatsbv
quote
in
the
beginning
of
my
narrative).
Over
the
past
two
years
I
have
become
a
lot
less
judgmental
about
other
people's
writing,
I
have
learned
how
to
better
appreciate
advantages
I've
had
in
my
life,
and
how
to
better
use
them
in
order
to
help
others.
I
have
gone
above
and
beyond
what
was
expected
of
me,
and
I
have
stepped
up
to
the
plate
and
done
what
I
thought
was
necessary
to
help
"my
writers".
Unlike
the
year
before
when
my
biggest
WA-challenges
were
writing-related,
the
challenges
I
encountered
during
this
past
year
were
primarily
people-related.
During
the
first
semester
of
the
past
year,
I
was
the
WA
for
a
First-Year
Seminar.
I
knew
the
professor
who
taught
it
very
well,
I
knew
quite
a
bit
about
the
subject
matter,
so
I
was
ready
for
one
of
those
perfect
WA
experiences.
Well,
I
was
bitterly
disappointed
to
say
the
least.
The
assignments
were
not
challenging
at
all;
they
were
your
typical
sixth
grade
"flip
open
the
encyclopedia
and
copy
everything"
book
reports,
and
needless
to
day,
they
did
not
involve
any
thinking
on
the
part
of
the
writers.
There
was
no
need
for
a
thesis
in
any
of
the
papers
during
the
semester.
I
just
found
myself
reading
and
re-reading
the
same
facts
presented
almost
the
same
way
in
all
15
papers.
I
felt
like
there
was
no
point
for
me
to
be
there
-
the
encyclopedias
were
all
already
proofread
-
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
do
it
again.
Then
one
day,
as
I
was
complaining
to
one
of
my
friends
about
WA-related
issues,
I
realized
that
I
was
stuck
in
a
WA
comfort
zone
and
I
was
not
making
much
attempt
to
get
out
of
it
and
make
the
best
out
of
an
ugly
situation.
I
was
not
doing
all
that
I
could,
and
there
was
a
lot
I
could
do.
I
was
a
junior,
and
writing
had
been
an
integral
part
of
my
education
since
I
could
remember.
I
knew
what
I
was
doing
as
far
as
writing
went,
but,
unfortunately,
I
couldn't
say
the
same
about
the
writers
in
my
class.
Sure,
they
could
copy
and
paraphrase
from
an
encyclopedia,
but
that
doesn't
make
them
good
writers!!!
In
fact,
they
would
be
in
for
a
rude
awakening
once
they
start
taking
First
Year
Writing.
So
even
though
the
professor
wasn't
challenging
his
students
writing-wise,
I
made
it
my
responsibility
to
introduce
them
to
various
writing
terms
and
issues.
I
hoped
that,
in
the
best
case,
this
would
take
their
writing
to
a
new
height,
and,
in
the
worst
case,
they
wouldn't
feel
as
overwhelmed
in
FYW.
I
told
each
one
of
them
what
a
thesis
was,
why
it
was
necessary
in
a
paper,
and
I
helped
them
brainstorm
ways
to
incorporate
a
thesis
in
their
encyclopedia-style
papers.
I
think
it
helped
because
the
papers
I
saw
for
a
second
time
seemed
to
be
more
organized
and
clear.
What
made
my
WA-ing
for
this
particular
class
hard,
however,
was
the
fact
that
normally
I
would
have
no
problem
going
up
to
the
professor
and
letting
him
or
her
know
in
a
tactful
way
that
a
lot
could
be
improved
with
the
writing
aspect
of
the
course.
In
this
case,
however
it
was
not
as
easy.
First
of
all,
the
professor
just
didn't
listen
to
me
(or
to
anyone
else)
-
he
was
too
preoccupied
with
what
HE
had
to
say...bad
communication
skills
as
most
people
would
term
it.
Secondly,
I
knew
the
professor
from
a
variety
of
other
campus
activities
I
was
involved
in
and
I
knew
he
does
not
take
criticism
well.
Therefore,
I
did
not
want
to
jeopardize
my
interaction
with
him
at
other
levels
by
being
an
overly-critical
and
demanding
WA.
In
a
situation
like
this,
the
best
thing
I
could
do
was
to
simply
go
ahead,
introduce
the
students
to
a
few
writing
issues,
and
pretend
that
everything
was
going
great
-which
is
what
I
ended
up
doing.
This
experience
also
taught
me
how
to
deal
with
really
good
writers.
One
of
the
students
in
the
class
was
an
exceptionally
good
writer.
He
was
light
years
ahead
of
everyone
in
the
class.
His
papers
were
what
a
real
paper
should
be.
I
think
I
was
so
excited
to
have
someone
in
my
class
that
actually
knew
what
he
was
doing,
that
I
took
this
as
an
opportunity
to
be
"a
real
WA".
In
addition,
dealing
with
good
writers
had
never
been
a
strength
of
mine,
so
I
decided
it
was
time
to
change
that.
We
discussed
what
was
good
about
his
writing,
what
his
strengths
were,
what
he
enjoyed
most
about
writing
the
paper.
Naturally,
this
lead
to
talking
about
what
the
weaker
parts
of
his
writing
were.
My
conferences
with
him
did
not
last
half
and
hour,
but
they
were
still
productive.
After
dealing
with
him,
dealing
with
good
writers
is
a
breeze.
The
real
key
to
WA
success
in
such
a
situation
is
to
realize
that,
very
much
like
you
(the
WA),
this
writer
has
had
certain
writing-related
advantages
in
his/her
life.
You
then
have
to
use
the
advantages
YOU
have
to
help
the
writer
know
him/herself
better.
This
feisty,
proactive
WA-attitude
was
definitely
helpful
during
the
second
semester
too.
I
was
assigned
to
a
VAST
taught
by
a
professor
in
the
engineering
department.
The
assignments
were
challenging,
the
class
seemed
to
be
exactly
what
a
VAST
should
be.
There
was
one
major
problem
though
-
student
apathy.
I
think
the
professor
was
used
to
it
and
did
not
have
high
expectations
for
his
students,
but
the
apathy
was
definitely
reflected
in
their
writing.
The
papers
addressed
the
assignment,
most
of
them
had
a
thesis
and
were
fairly
organized;
however,
they
were
obviously
not
as
well
thought-out
as
they
should
have
been.
They
seemed
to
touch
the
surface
of
the
assignment
and
did
not
even
attempt
to
go
any
deeper
than
that.
Again,
I
took
it
upon
myself
to
ask
the
writers
questions
which
I
thought
would
provoke
some
thought
process
and
help
them
create
a
better
piece
of
writing.
I
succeeded
with
some,
others
just
plain
did
not
care.
Where
my
WA-experience
really
paid
off
(aside
from
the
$540
a
semester
-are
we
ever
going
to
get
a
raise?)
was
in
my
first
attempts
to
reach
out
to
the
real
world.
In
early
February
I
finally
put
together
a
resume
in
search
for
a
summer
internship
and,
of
course,
I
included
my
WA
work
on
my
resume.
I
was
applying
for
positions
in
the
actuarial
field
which
has
a
reputation
of
being
a
primarily
"number
field",
so
I
really
was
not
expecting
any
WA-related
questions
at
my
interviews.
However,
at
all
my
interviews
I
was
asked
to
describe
my
WA-experience,
and
all
my
interviewers
seemed
to
be
impressed
by
the
job
and
the
skills
it
builds.
It
was
definitely
one
of
the
most
solid
"bricks"
of
my
resume.
I
fully
appreciated
the
skills
I
developed
by
being
a
WA
this
summer
when
I
worked
as
an
actuarial
intern
in
a
big
insurance
company.
Even
though
it
is
a
"number
field",
the
need
for
good
communication
skills
is
as
big
as
in
any
other
field.
Many
times
I
was
asked
to
explain
certain
ideas
to
someone
who
was
not
that
familiar
with
them
and
it
felt
exactly
like
being
a
WA.
I
also
had
to
write
some
technical
business
memos.
After
I
wrote
the
first
one,
I
took
it
to
my
manager
for
feedback.
Even
though
I
knew
I
was
new
to
this
type
of
writing
as
well
as
to
the
jargon
of
insurance,
and
I
wanted
to
be
criticized,
I
was
still
nervous.
I
felt
like
I
was
in
the
first
grade
and
this
was
the
first
composition
we
ever
had
to
submit
to
the
teacher.
I
guess
some
things
never
change.
In
my
final
evaluation,
1
was
classified
as
a
strong
communicator
and
I
know
that
I
owe
a
lot
of
that
to
the
fact
that
I
am
a
WA.
Being
a
WA
has
definitely
helped
me
grow.
I
feel
like
I
can
tackle
and
master
any
type
of
writing.
In
fact,
it
has
made
me
realize
that
I
need
a
career
where
working
with
people
and
communicating
ideas
to
others
plays
a
crucial
role.
I
have
become
more
compassionate,
more
patient,
more
assertive,
more
capable
to
use
my
own
strengths
and
advantages
to
help
others.
And,
as
hard
as
it
is
for
a
perfectionist
like
me
to
admit,
being
a
WA
has
definitely
taught
me
that
perfection
is
just
plain
not
attainable.
Or
is
it?
