Literacy
Narrative
Fall
2006
WA
Workshop
In
examining
myself
as
a
writer,
I
have
found
that
I
am
proud
of
what
I
have
accomplished
over
the
years.
When
I
sat
down
to
begin
this
assignment
I
asked
myself,
what
has
been
my
greatest
writing
achievement
so
far?
To
answer
this
question,
I
thought
back
to
the
many
literary
analyses,
research
papers,
and
lab
reports
that
I
have
completed
so
far
in
college.
It
then
hit
me
that
my
mind
automatically
generated
a
list
of
advanced
racademics
writing
when
faced
with
the
task
to
determine
my
greatest
writing
achievement.
However,
what
about
my
writing
before
college?
What
about
my
writing
before
I
knew
how
to
write
racademicallys
per
say?
The
truth
is
that
I
had
forgotten
all
about
it.
I
had
forgotten
the
process
of
growth
and
the
many
steps
that
I
had
taken
in
order
to
become
the
writer
that
I
am
today.
I
had
forgotten
that
in
elementary
school
I
would
have
deemed
my
daily
journal
or
paragraph
about
what
I
did
over
Christmas
break
with
my
family
as
my
greatest
writing
achievement.
In
examining
my
history
as
a
writer
from
my
first
and
simplest
writing
tasks,
I
realized
that
those
small
initial
steps
of
learning
how
to
write
shaped
my
writing
today.
I
remember
that
writing
was
easy
in
kindergarten.
We
usually
had
to
write
small
words
on
various
creative
projects.
For
example,
I
once
created
a
Valentineus
Day
card
for
my
parents
and
had
to
write
rLove,
Marjories
at
the
bottom
in
crayon.
Although
I
was
told
what
to
write
and
basically
copied
what
my
teacher
wrote
on
the
board,
my
parents
were
ecstatic
when
I
brought
that
tiny
card
home.
They
knew
that
I
made
an
honest
attempt
to
try
to
form
the
letters
correctly
on
paper.
The
scribbled
out
and
crooked
letters
rl-o-v-es
and
an
almost
illegible
name
were
the
beginnings
of
my
writing
career.
My
parents
still
have
that
card
that
I
made
so
long
ago
and
showed
it
to
me
recently.
I
realized
how
far
I
had
come;
originally
learning
to
write
by
imitating
my
teachers,
and
now
continuing
to
learn
how
to
write
by
practicing
and
writing
myself.
In
first
grade,
I
remember
being
given
a
little
bit
of
freedom
with
writing,
even
though
I
hardly
knew
how
to
write
at
all.
I
remember
writing
a
weekly
journal
entry
in
pencil
and
drawing
a
picture
above
it
with
crayons
to
depict
what
I
wrote
about.
I
used
to
write
a
lot
about
things
I
did
with
my
family,
yet
I
remember
feeling
very
frustrated
because
I
couldnut
put
all
of
my
thoughts
into
words
yet.
I
didnut
know
how
to
spell
certain
words
or
even
what
words
to
use
in
some
places.
I
find
it
is
so
interesting
that
I
actually
remember
feeling
held
back
by
my
lack
of
knowledge.
I
really
wanted
to
write
and
I
knew
I
could,
I
just
lacked
a
lot
of
the
skills.
These
first
grade
journal
entries
were
my
first
experiences
with
creative
writing
(free
writing
and
expression).
I
loved
being
able
to
write
about
anything
I
wanted,
and
I
liked
the
fact
that
I
could
draw
a
picture
to
help
me
show
others
what
I
was
trying
to
say.
Sometimes
I
would
draw
the
picture
first
and
then
try
to
find
the
words
from
there.
I
even
continued
to
write
in
that
journal
the
summer
after
my
first
grade
year.
Free
writing
is
still
something
that
I
enjoy
doing
as
I
still
keep
a
journal
and
even
have
some
files
on
my
computer
in
which
I
open
up
and
use
to
free-write.
Although
I
remember
realizing
that
I
liked
to
write
in
first
grade,
I
ran
in
to
some
problems
when
I
was
finally
taught
a
bit
about
sentence
structure
and
paragraphs.
I
remember
being
very
confused
about
where
to
place
the
periods
in
my
sentences.
I
had
no
clue
how
to
tell
when
a
complete
thought
stopped.
Consequently,
when
I
turned
in
small
writing
assignments
(like
my
journal
entries)
I
just
didnut
include
the
periods.
I
hoped
that
my
teacher
would
just
write
the
periods
in
for
me
and
then
I
would
know
where
they
were
supposed
to
go.
I
guess
I
was
a
little
embarrassed
to
ask
for
help,
something
that
still
happens
to
me
sometimes
today!
One
day
however,
my
teacher
called
me
back
to
her
desk
during
a
silent
work
session
and
worked
with
me
for
about
20
minutes
on
period
placement.
This
was
the
first
time
I
can
remember
that
a
teacher
had
reached
out
to
help
me
with
a
specific
issue
that
I
was
having;
and
believe
me,
it
really
was
an
issue
to
a
little
first
grader!
By
the
end
of
those
20
minutes
I
was
a
pro
at
writing
sentences,
at
least
short
and
simple
ones.
It
is
quite
funny
that
I
used
to
only
have
to
pay
attention
to
something
as
simple
as
period
placement
when
now
I
have
to
pay
attention
to
the
entire
contents
of
the
St.
Martinus
Handbook!
In
third
grade,
I
encountered
a
computer
word
processor
for
the
first
time.
I
entered
the
school
wide
science
fair
with
a
rGrowing
Crystalss
project
and
completed
every
aspect
of
the
project
myself.
I
typed
up
the
explanation
of
my
project
and
my
results
on
my
dadus
tiny
IBM
computer.
My
dad
only
gave
me
brief
instructions
on
how
to
use
the
word
processor,
but
I
picked
it
up
fast.
I
ended
up
winning
first
place
in
the
3rd
grade
division.
To
this
day,
I
remember
that
the
judgeus
main
comment
was
that
he
was
very
impressed
that
I
constructed
the
entire
presentation
of
the
project
myself
including
the
typed
2
paragraphs
pasted
to
the
poster
board.
He
said
rwell
my
dear,
you
are
a
very
good
writer
and
typist!s
His
comment
made
me
feel
extremely
proud
of
what
I
had
done.
Not
only
did
I
construct
and
type
the
two
paragraphs
myself
(getting
all
of
the
crystal
terminology
correct
might
I
add),
but
they
were
actually
good
enough
to
gain
praise.
Previously
I
mentioned
that
my
first
creative
or
free
writing
experience
had
been
with
a
tiny
and
simple
journal
in
first
grade.
My
next
memorable
creative
writing
experience
wasnut
until
sixth
grade.
My
sixth
grade
English
teacher
required
that
every
student
write
an
entry
in
a
journal
once
per
day.
These
were
checked
once
per
week.
We
were
allowed
to
simply
write
what
we
did
with
our
days,
but
I
began
to
use
this
as
an
outlet
for
things
on
my
mind
or
things
that
were
bothering
me.
This
definitely
got
me
used
to
writing
frequently
and
helped
me
learn
to
express
myself.
It
also
helped
me
trust
my
teacher
more
because
I
was
sharing
sometimes
personal
things
in
my
journal.
Since
then,
I
have
learned
that
a
major
part
of
writing
is
trusting
the
readers
or
the
audience.
I
can
not
possibly
connect
with
my
readers
on
a
personal
level
if
I
do
not
let
my
guard
down
at
times
and
open
up.
My
first
encounter
with
poetry
also
occurred
in
sixth
grade.
I
learned
different
types
of
poetry
including
haiku
and
was
encouraged
to
write
my
own
haiku
poetry.
One
of
my
poems
was
displayed
on
the
class
bulletin
board
where
everyone
could
see
it.
My
English
teacher
told
me,
rKeep
writingiyouure
good
at
its.
Even
those
simple
words
encouraged
me
and
I
carried
them
around
wherever
I
went.
This
is
also
when
my
parents
began
to
take
a
strong
interest
in
my
writing
and
encourage
me
also.
My
mom
still
says
to
this
day,
rSixth
grade
English-
thatus
where
you
began
to
learn
to
write
the
way
you
do!s
My
first
encounter
with
the
five
paragraph
essay/research
format
as
well
as
my
first
encounter
with
the
formal
writing
process
(research,
note
taking,
outline,
rough
draft,
final
draft)
occurred
in
seventh
grade.
This
was
also
where
I
learned
to
construct
a
bibliography
and
cite
sources.
Each
stage
of
the
process
was
checked.
The
grade-wide
history
topic
that
year
was
the
Middle
Ages,
and
my
paper
was
on
medieval
medicine.
I
remember
finding
it
annoying
to
have
to
keep
track
of
all
of
my
sources
and
to
learn
how
to
write
a
bibliography.
I
remember
having
to
go
back
tons
of
times
and
put
quotes
in
or
citations.
I
remember
thinking,
why
did
it
all
of
a
sudden
become
so
much
trouble
to
write
a
research
report?
Although
I
conformed
to
procedure,
I
did
not
yet
understand
why
citations
were
so
necessary.
Although
the
process
of
going
through
each
stage
was
painstaking,
this
project
helped
me
realize
that
organization
and
planning
are
key
elements
in
any
project
or
paper.
I
learned
effective
time
management,
and
still
carry
that
with
me
today.
If
I
did
not
learn
these
basic
skills,
it
would
have
taken
me
longer
to
grasp
how
to
write
the
lab
reports
and
research
reports
that
I
write
today.
Although
I
was
learning
various
forms
of
writing
throughout
middle
school,
creative
writing
especially
poetry
was
my
favorite.
I
wrote
my
first
published
poem
in
eighth
grade
called
rHeart
Crumbss,
and
it
was
chosen
by
the
eighth
grade
English
teachers
to
appear
in
the
school
newspaper.
I
almost
didnut
submit
the
poem
because
it
was
so
personal
to
me
(about
a
boy
that
I
liked
ending
up
not
liking
me
back).
Yet
I
remembered
that
love
is
a
universal
emotion
and
that
I
would
be
able
to
connect
to
my
readers
very
well
through
the
poem.
Eighth
grade
year
was
also
my
first
time
writing
a
play
or
dialogue.
I
collaborated
with
three
other
students
on
it
and
then
we
got
to
take
present
it
at
the
elementary
school
to
a
class
of
younger
children.
My
group
received
a
lot
of
praise
from
the
elementary
school
class
and
teacher
as
well
as
from
my
actual
English
teacher.
After
seeing
the
potential
impact
that
my
work
could
have
on
audiences,
the
potential
for
laughter
and
delight
or
other
emotions,
I
knew
I
loved
writing
even
more.
I
can
safely
say
that
I
began
to
come
into
my
own
as
a
writer
in
eighth
grade.
I
began
to
discover
my
likes
and
dislikes
about
writing,
and
I
truly
began
to
open
up
and
express
myself
by
means
of
poetry
and
other
forms.
I
also
gained
experience
in
poetry
analysis
in
eighth
grade
and
I
remember
some
poems
striking
me
so
deeply
that
I
felt
as
if
the
poet
was
speaking
directly
to
me.
My
goal
then
became
to
have
that
kind
of
effect
on
my
readers,
no
matter
in
what
genre
I
was
writing.
I
remember
feeling
very
well
prepared
for
high
school
writing,
especially
in
the
way
of
creative
writing.
There
were
of
course
more
complicated
and
advanced
aspects
of
formal
writing
for
research
papers
that
I
needed
to
learn
and
practice,
but
it
was
not
overwhelmingly
difficult
to
pick
up.
I
remember
laughing
when
my
freshman
English
teacher
dispelled
the
myth
that
all
essays
had
to
follow
the
exact
five
paragraph
format.
I
also
took
my
first
actual
creative
writing
class
that
year.
It
focused
mainly
on
poetry
but
we
wrote
dialogues,
short
stories,
and
childrenus
stories
as
well.
It
was
amazing
to
be
able
to
learn
more
about
and
practice
other
creative
genres,
and
I
must
say
that
writing
the
childrenus
story
was
the
best
part.
I
was
once
again
given
the
opportunity
to
share
my
work
with
younger
students.
My
class
and
I
took
our
childrenus
stories
over
to
the
day
care
center
located
in
my
high
school
and
read
and
acted
out
our
stories
for
them.
I
again
loved
seeing
the
impact
that
my
work
had
on
the
intended
audience.
The
creative
writing
class
also
made
me
grow
as
a
writer
because
I
began
to
severely
value
the
prewriting
and
editing
process.
During
my
junior
year
in
high
school
I
took
an
advanced
writing
class
called
Honors
Imaginative
Process.
We
read
creative
works
and
also
created
our
own.
I
remember
learning
a
lot
about
my
own
writing
in
this
class,
such
as
what
themes
I
usually
incorporate
into
my
poetry
and
stories.
I
also
began
to
discover
poets
that
I
really
connected
with
and
whose
style
I
admired
(Jane
Kenyon,
Mark
Doty,
etc.)
This
class
also
helped
me
develop
skills
for
interacting
with
other
writers,
as
a
major
portion
of
it
was
reviewing
and
editing
the
creative
works
of
others
in
my
class.
We
also
did
this
amazing
project
called
a
rcyber-lits
where
we
would
take
one
of
our
poems
and
put
it
on
PowerPoint
slides
to
music
with
pictures,
kind
of
like
the
rolling
credits
to
a
movie.
This
helped
me
express
myself
further
in
my
poetry.
We
also
put
other
classmates
poems
to
rcyber-litssiand
it
enabled
me
to
try
to
analyze
my
classmatesu
poetry
and
work
with
them.
I
can
safely
say
that
I
gained
a
new
appreciation
for
collaborative
projects
and
helping
other
students.
After
my
amazing
experience
in
that
honors
class,
I
was
really
looking
forward
to
AP
English
my
senior
year
in
high
school.
I
hate
to
say
it,
but
regardless
of
my
enthusiasm
senior
year
in
high
school
ended
up
discouraging
me
greatly
as
a
writer.
It
seemed
that
no
matter
what
I
did,
or
how
hard
I
worked,
my
AP
English
teacher
never
liked
any
of
my
writing
and
never
thought
it
was
up
to
his
standards;
and
he
definitely
made
me
aware
of
it.
It
was
hard
for
me
to
accept
because
I
had
no
problems
previously
with
other
teachers,
and
I
was
always
able
to
work
harder
and
get
better
to
meet
their
standards
if
need
be.
It
seemed
that
nothing
I
wrote
was
the
rrights
way
to
write.
I
started
to
think
that
maybe
I
shouldnut
be
an
English
major
in
college
after
all.
I
started
to
think
that
I
didnut
have
what
it
takes,
and
I
seriously
doubted
myself.
I
knew
that
analytical
essays
like
I
was
writing
in
AP
English
would
be
a
major
part
of
college
writing
and
I
was
extremely
nervous.
I
dreaded
going
to
that
English
class
because
I
felt
inferior.
I
feel
rather
embarrassed
in
saying
this,
but
I
was
honestly
ready
to
give
up
on
writing.
However,
I
graduated
and
was
accepted
to
Lafayette
and
was
extremely
interested
but
nervous
to
see
how
my
writing
would
compare
to
other
college
bound
students.
M
comparative
chance
came
when
I
took
College
Writing
my
second
semester
at
Lafayette.
The
class
was
centered
on
creativity
and
the
creative
process.
I
was
able
to
write
more
poetry,
but
to
my
delight
also
got
to
write
many
narratives.
I
learned
many
methods
of
capturing
the
readerus
attention
as
well
as
many
methods
of
building
suspense.
I
was
actually
able
to
interview
Mark
Doty
in
person
for
my
final
project,
and
it
was
an
absolutely
amazing
experience.
I
remembered
back
to
junior
year
in
high
school
when
I
discovered
that
I
loved
his
poetry,
and
felt
I
felt
like
things
were
coming
full
circle
for
me.
In
other
classes,
I
would
probably
be
only
analyzing
and
writing
about
the
poetry
of
mark
Doty.
However,
my
final
paper
for
College
Writing
was
a
totally
different
take
on
analysis.
I
analyzed
the
creative
habits
of
a
poet
(Mark
Doty)
and
compared
them
to
the
creative
habits
of
an
architect
(my
cousinus
husband,
Dave).
This
was
another
instance
in
which
I
shared
my
work
with
family
members.
I
gave
a
copy
to
Dave
as
well
as
his
father
and
my
cousin
(Daveus
wife),
and
they
not
only
praised
me
for
my
work,
but
gained
a
new
found
respect
for
and
understanding
of
Daveus.
Since
then
I
have
written
about
many
different
things.
I
have
written
about
American
History,
Medieval
Literature,
even
about
the
behavior
of
mice
and
their
learning
processes
(in
one
of
my
Psychology
classes
of
course).
Although
one
minute
I
may
be
writing
a
literary
analysis
and
the
next
minute
a
lab
report,
I
have
to
say
that
I
enjoy
all
aspects
and
topics
of
writing.
I
have
to
say
that
I
find
it
truly
amazing
how
I
have
progressed
as
a
writer,
or
how
people
in
general
progress
as
writers.
I
have
learned
to
take
into
account
my
audience
and
how
the
reader
will
react
to
what
I
say.
I
have
learned
how
to
listen
to
feedback,
and
give
it
as
well.
I
have
learned
how
to
improve
and
help
others
improve.
In
reviewing
my
short
history
as
a
writer,
I
am
amazed
at
how
much
I
valued
and
continue
to
value
the
opinions
of
those
I
look
up
to.
That
is
probably
why
the
continuous
comments
and
lack
of
praise
on
the
part
of
my
AP
English
teacher
hit
me
so
hard.
Yet
I
realize
that
any
struggles
I
have
faced
have
only
made
me
stronger.
I
continue
to
value
working
closely
with
my
professors
and
peers
in
order
to
improve
myself
even
more.
My
writing
has
been
a
process
of
growth,
and
I
think
it
is
safe
to
say
that
that
growth
will
be
continuous
and
long-term.
