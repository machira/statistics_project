Writing
Experience
Looking
back
on
the
past
year,
I
can't
believe
that
I
am
approaching
my
senior
year
in
college.
It
is
interesting
for
me
to
consider
the
evolution
of
my
experience
here
from
many
different
perspectives:
academic,
social,
political,
and
spiritual.
Therefore,
looking
back
on
the
history
as
a
writer
over
the
past
year
encompasses
all
of
these
domains
because
writing
is
central
to
my
learning
experience
at
Lafayette.
Being
a
WA
has
given
me
the
opportunity,
then,
to
not
only
write
and
revise
my
own
work
but
to
share
in
the
writing
process
of
my
peers.
Focusing
on
writing
as
a
process
and
not
a
solitary
act
with
a
definitive
ending
has
helped
to
make
my
writing
stronger
and
hopefully
helped
me
to
encourage
good
writing
patterns
in
the
students
with
whom
I
worked
last
year.
Although
I
was
only
a
WA
for
one
class
(I
went
abroad
to
London
in
the
spring),
I
found
my
experience
as
a
WA
to
be
quite
rewarding.
During
the
first
semester
last
year
I
had
to
struggle
with
finding
an
effective
way
to
work
with
different
types
of
writers
in
my
WA
class.
I
had
a
group
of
first
year
students--mostly
engineers--who
ranged
from
eager
and
enthusiastic
to
lazy
and
disinterested.
Some
of
the
students
were
happy
to
become
engaged
in
quality
conversations
about
their
writing
and
even
scheduled
multiple
appointments
to
talk
about
multiple
drafts
and
revisions.
These
students
I
would
say
were
most
similar
to
my
own
writing
style,
so
I
guess
working
with
them
was
a
parallel
experience
for
me.
I
was
able
to
think
about
suggestions
and
concerns
that
they
had
when
I
worked
on
writing
assignments
for
my
own
classes.
After
all,
that
is
how
the
writing
associate
program
is
designed
to
work.
I
like
knowing
that
I
am
not
some
authoritative
force
ready
to
destroy
an
FYS
paper
with
the
wrath
of
my
red
pen,
but,
rather,
I
have
the
willingness
to
take
quality
time
to
discuss
writing
and
offer
helpful
suggestions
to
interested
writers.
Unfortunately,
the
above
description
hardly
dominated
my
experience
as
a
WA.
Many
of
my
students
were
reluctant
to
talk
about
their
writing
because
they
were
either
too
lazy
or
too
shy.
Others
were
so
set
on
their
way
of
doing
things
that
my
suggestions
clearly
went
unnoticed
to
them.
I
would
like
to
think
that
these
students
are
just
young
and
naive,
but
the
truth
remains
that
no
matter
what
a
WA
does,
he
or
she
will
never
be
able
to
have
an
quality
writing
discussion
with
every
student
he
or
she
encounters.
I
think
that
was
one
of
the
most
difficult
lessons
I
learned
last
fall.
I
got
discouraged
with
a
few
students
who
just
wanted
no
part
of
my
service
to
them.
I
felt
that
it
was
a
reflection
of
my
own
efforts.
Of
course
I
continued
to
encourage
them
in
any
way
that
I
could,
but
I
got
to
a
point
where
I
realized
that
just
because
a
student
did
not
want
to
talk
about
his
writing
did
not
mean
that
I
was
a
bad
WA.
The
unfortunate
consequence
for
these
unwilling
students
was
that
their
lack
of
attempt
to
use
the
WA
as
an
asset
most
often
reflected
poorly
on
their
grades
because
they
missed
out
on
key
ideas
that
I
was
able
to
share
by
talking
with
the
professor
about
the
focus
of
the
assignment
and
by
making
observations
about
a
group
of
papers
as
a
whole.
In
one
of
my
upper
level
English
class
I
was
lucky
enough
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
WA
pair.
My
class
was
assigned
a
WA
and
although
I
thought
at
first
that
it
might
be
awkward
and
even
superfluous
to
see
a
WA
for
my
writing
while
I
was
a
WA
myself,
I
realized
quickly
how
valuable
she
was
to
my
writing.
I
was
able
to
get
quality
feedback
on
issues
of
thesis,
clarity,
and
form.
It
was
reassuring
especially
since
the
class
was
quite
difficult
and
even
a
bit
intimidating
for
me.
I
was
writing
about
topics
that
were
more
abstract
and
in-depth
than
I
had
ever
worked
with
before.
I
had
to
combine
the
work
of
different
genres,
eras,
and
ethnicities
in
a
way
that
made
sense.
I
remember
getting
the
assignments
and
reading
them
over
and
over
not
even
knowing
where
to
begin.
However,
by
starting
with
a
simple
idea
and
then
developing
it
slowly
to
include
several
different
sources,
I
was
able
to
make
some
sense
of
what
had
previously
seemed
impossible
to
me.
Having
an
unbiased
reader
help
to
steer
my
ideas
in
the
right
directions
was
crucial
to
my
success
in
the
class.
I
never
understood
when
I
would
hear
rumblings
in
class
about
how
stupid
it
was
for
seniors
to
have
a
WA
when
it
should
be
they
who
understand
a
WA's
value
the
most.
They
have
been
around
long
enough
to
know
that
a
WA
is
there
to
help
improve
their
writing,
not
to
burden
it.
I
hope
that
other
upper
level
classes
I
take
this
year
also
have
use
the
writing
associate
program
so
that
I
can
continue
to
benefit
from
both
sides
of
the
writing
discussion.
The
writing
I
did
in
my
spring
semester
last
year
was
drastically
different
from
that
of
my
fall
semester.
Actually,
everything
was
entirely
different
because
I
was
in
a
whole
new
country
with
a
new
school,
new
friends,
and
new
professors.
My
school
in
London
did
not
have
any
kind
of
equivalent
program
to
Lafayette's
WA
program,
so
I
was
forced
to
consider
my
own
writing
process
alone
or
to
ask
my
professors
for
assistance.
In
general,
I
felt
that
the
formal
writing
I
did
in
London
was
poorly
assigned,
most
notably
in
a
class
that
I
took
about
women
in
contemporary
fiction
and
film.
The
topics
we
discussed
in
class
were
extremely
interesting,
a
combination
of
literature,
women's'
studies,
and
psychology
(as
a
double
psychology
and
English
major,
this
was
perfect
for
me).
I
was
fascinated
and
I
looked
forward
to
writing
about
them.
However,
with
each
assignment
I
was
asked
to
make
only
bland
comparisons
and
observations
and
my
writing
was
graded
half-heartedly.
For
me,
a
paper
with
an
"A"
and
no
comments
is
almost
as
bad
as
one
with
an
"F"
and
no
comments.
If
the
whole
point
of
writing
for
a
literature
class
is
to
communicate
my
observations
and
feelings
about
another
author's
work,
then
I
need
to
know
if
the
reader
of
my
paper
has
understood
what
I
tried
to
say.
I
think
that's
why
our
WA
program
works
so
well.
It
gives
the
author
a
chance
to
discuss
his
ideas
with
another
reader
before
having
to
hand
it
into
the
professor.
Constructive
feedback
is
an
essential
part
of
the
writing
process,
and
when
I
realized
that
I
would
not
be
given
much
of
it,
I
have
to
say
that
my
motivation
to
challenge
myself
as
a
writer
declined
significantly
in
that
class.
While
my
formal
writing
was
not
very
significant
in
my
history
as
a
writer
over
the
past
year,
my
more
informal
writing
certainly
was.
I
had
two
classes
in
which
the
majority
of
the
work
was
comprised
of
keeping
extensive
journal
entries.
I
have
kept
a
journal
pretty
consistently
for
much
of
my
life,
but
I
have
never
been
in
a
position
before
to
keep
a
journal
as
a
major
part
of
a
class.
The
first
class
was
called
"Arts
in
London,"
and
I
was
to
attend
various
performances
and
write
my
reaction
to
them.
I
found
that
having
to
write
about
them
made
me
listen
or
watch
much
more
intently.
I
noticed
patterns,
themes,
and
parallels
much
more
easily.
I
was
able
to
take
a
work
of
art
or
music
and
figure
out
how
it
was
significant
somehow
in
my
own
life.
It
made
me
observe
my
whole
experience
in
London,
and
I
even
started
writing
about
my
reactions
to
performances
that
I
attended
and
places
that
I
visited
on
my
own
outside
of
class.
Now
when
I
write
in
my
own
journal
I
am
more
likely
to
observe
and
describe
my
experiences
on
a
deeper
level.
I
did
have
one
problem
with
a
writing
assignment
during
my
semester
in
London.
At
the
end
of
the
semester
I
had
to
write
a
formal
paper
for
my
Arts
in
London
class,
and
I
chose
to
go
out
on
a
limb
and
make
an
argument
that
London
is
oftentimes
a
means
to
advance
revolutionary
to
art
forms
because
the
city's
diversity
and
force
in
the
art
world
help
to
allow
new
ideas
to
be
accepted.
I
felt
that
I
made
a
good
case
for
my
argument,
but
my
professor
commented
that
he
did
not
agree
with
my
argument
and
therefore,
he
gave
me
a
bad
grade
on
the
paper.
Now,
I
am
not
one
to
argue
about
grades
when
I
feel
that
I
did
not
accurately
complete
an
assignment,
but
I
actually
had
put
a
lot
of
thought
into
the
paper
and
I
felt
that
I
had
been
punished
by
trying
to
write
about
something
a
bit
more
difficult
that
I
could've
chosen.
I
guess
that
is
something
that
I
have
to
keep
in
mind
when
instructing
my
WA
students
to
follow
a
certain
format.
Sometimes
I
too
am
guilty
of
following
the
rules,
but
I
realize
that
the
best
writing
often
emerges
when
a
writer
understands
rules
and
accepted
standards
of
writing
but
chooses
to
ignore
them
in
order
to
show
more
self-expression.
In
my
case,
I
just
felt
like
my
professor
was
being
completely
arbitrary
and
unfair
in
his
evaluation
of
my
argument.
Then
again,
it
might
have
just
been
a
cultural
difference
between
the
way
papers
are
graded
in
the
states
verses
the
in
England.
In
any
case,
I
hope
that
in
the
future
I
don't
have
to
deal
with
the
discouragement
of
such
unsupported
criticism
of
my
writing.
The
other
class
for
which
I
wrote
a
journal
was
a
bit
more
challenging
but
every
bit
as
rewarding
to
me.
This
class
focused
on
aspects
of
London
art,
culture,
and
history
that
are
not
often
studied,
especially
by
long-term
tourists
like
myself.
My
professor
forced
us
to
go
to
less
popular
(and
sometimes
more
dangerous)
sections
of
the
city
and
then
write
about
our
observations.
Additionally,
I
had
to
read
British
newspapers
and
made
parallels
between
what
I
read
about
and
what
I
encountered
in
my
own
everyday
life.
Basically,
my
journal
helped
me
to
learn
things
both
about
London
and
about
myself
living
in
London
that
I
would
never
have
dreamed
to
learn
if
I
had
not
been
encouraged
to
visit
some
of
the
more
abstract
attractions
that
this
city
has
to
offer.
I
was
able
to
become
more
independent
and
more
comfortable
in
a
city
environment
while
combining
my
own
experiences
with
literature
and
art.
Everything
came
together
in
a
journal
that
is
so
personally
significant
to
me
I
can't
even
believe
that
I
wrote
it
as
a
class
assignment.
All
in
all,
the
history
as
a
writer
over
the
past
year
has
been
a
well-rounded
learning
experience
for.
From
writing
and
revising
my
own
work
to
getting
used
to
discussing
the
writing
of
others
through
my
work
as
a
WA,
I
have
acquired
and
new
appreciation
for
the
writing
process.
I
hope
that
some
of
my
experiences
will
help
to
encourage
new
WAs
this
year,
and
I
look
forward
to
using
writing
this
year
as
a
way
to
once
again
map
my
progress
as
a
student
and
as
an
individual.
Plus,
I
look
forward
to
making
the
transition
back
into
the
"American,"
knowing
that
my
time
abroad
has
given
my
a
worldly
perspective
that
will
be
reflected
in
the
way
I
write
and
look
at
the
writing
of
others.
