August
1999
As
I
attempted
to
prepare
for
this
paper,
I
spent
hours
trying
to
figure
out
exactly
what
I
had
written
in
my
twenty
years
of
existence.
Of
course
I
had
written
book
reports
and
numerous
research
papers,
but
I
tried
to
think
of
how
much
I
had
really
written
on
my
own.
Unfortunately,
with
only
a
few
exceptions,
I
realized
that
I
really
had
not
taken
much
time
in
my
life
to
write
for
myself.
As
I
tried
to
think
about
the
reactions
people
have
had
to
my
writings,
I
was
forced
to
realize
how
much
the
fear
of
other
people's
opinions
held
me
back.
However,
now,
in
retrospect,
I
see
how
my
fears
got
the
better
of
me.
Rarely
did
I
receive
negative
comments
in
reference
to
my
writings;
those
comments
that
were
not
positive
were
usually
appropriate
and
deserved.
By
looking
at
the
history
of
my
writing
I
can
easily
see
a
dividing
line.
There
is
the
creative
or
personal
writing
that
I
completed
on
my
own,
and
then
there
are
the
papers
and
mandatory
school
work
I
was
required
to
do.
I
never
let
the
two
cross
over
and
I
never
really
let
myself
expand
by
writing
for
a
school
newspaper
or
magazine.
Again,
I
think
this
was
a
fear
of
criticism
of
my
personal
work.
I
can
always
shrug
off
a
negative
comment
on
a
required
paper
by
saying
that
it
was
not
my
favorite
subject
to
write
about
or
that
I
was
stressed
or
could
not
find
enough
material
to
help
me.
However,
with
creative
writing,
I
am
forced
to
take
the
blame.
Looking
back,
I
can
see
how
ridiculous
all
of
this
is;
now,
I
feel
free
to
write
as
I
please.
I
take
criticism
for
what
it
is-constructive
criticism,
and
I
try
to
improve
from
there.
Unfortunately,
it
took
me
some
time
to
reach
this
point,
as
the
history
of
my
writing
can
clearly
show.
I
do
not
remember
my
exact
age,
but
it
must
have
been
in
my
fourth
or
fifth
year
that
I
began
to
write
creatively.
As
my
mother
has
reminded
me,
I
not
only
wrote
but
illustrated
several
"books."
Although
not
more
than
five
pages
in
length,
my
books,
especially
Spot
the
Dancing
Dog,
were
very
well
received
by
their
audiences,
which
usually
consisted
of
my
parents
and
older
sister.
Unfortunately,
outside
of
this
attempt,
there
was
only
one
other
time
in
my
life
that
I
wrote
creatively
for
my
own
pleasure;
that
work,
however,
yielded
only
two
paragraphs.
As
I
entered
elementary
school,
my
writing
consisted
of
one
to
two
page
book
reports
in
which
much
attention
was
given
to
the
decorative
colors
and
illustrations
on
the
cover.
Still,
I
did
well.
Never
did
my
teachers
or
parents
express
any
concern
over
my
writing
ability-
perhaps
it
was
my
handwriting
that
needed
work
back
then,
as
my
report
card
easily
makes
clear.
It
was
at
this
young
age
that
I
began
or
rather
was
encouraged
to
write
or
keep
a
diary.
It
was
not
to
be
used
all
the
time;
in
fact,
the
diary
began
as
my
family
went
on
a
vacation
to
Hawaii.
I
remember
thinking
about
what
a
hassle
it
was
to
write
every
night,
but
looking
back,
I
see
the
value
in
it.
Although
the
journal
is
difficult
to
read
and
full
of
misspellings,
it
is
written
completely
by
a
six-year
old
child.
I
talk
about
the
plane
ride
by
describing
the
clouds
as
"cotton
candy
that
I
want
to
eat"
and
the
people
below
as
"ants."
At
the
time,
I
recall
not
wanting
my
mother
to
read
the
diary,
but
I
believe
she
did
so
anyway.
Again,
although
somewhat
embarrassed
now,
I
see
why
my
mother
wanted
me
to
write
and
I
see
why
she
kept
this
childish
description
of
a
tropical
paradise.
We
may
have
rolls
of
pictures
from
Hawaii,
but
my
writings
show
a
completely
different
side
of
that
land.
As
I
entered
junior
high
school
and
then
moved
to
a
new
middle
school
in
Pennsylvania,
I
simply
remember
more
book
reports
or
small
"research"
papers
that
again
gave
much
credit
to
the
attached
illustrations
or
accompanying
visuals.
A
report
in
seventh
grade
on
20.
000
Leagues
Under
the
Sea
was
given
ten
extra
points
for
its
cover,
and
an
eighth
grade
report
on
Pearl
Buck's
The
Good
Earth
was
given
credit
for
my
daylong
attempt
to
locate
the
author's
house
in
Buck's
County.
Besides
the
embarrassment
felt
about
my
personal
writing,
I
really
do
not
recall
any
particular
like
or
dislike
of
any
certain
paper
before
high
school.
However,
as
I
entered
ninth
grade,
I
began
to
have
some
distinct
feelings.
As
I
mentioned
before,
my
writing
had
never
really
been
criticized.
(Or
at
least
I
do
not
remember
any
severe
criticism!)
My
first
year
of
high
school
followed
that
pattern,
but
also
brought
with
it
many
positive
comments.
A
particular
paper
that
I
remember
writing
was
for
my
history
class.
The
topic
was
to
choose
a
famous
person
with
whom
you
would
like
to
have
dinner.
I
spent
hours
trying
to
narrow
down
my
choice
and
eventually
went
overboard
in
describing
my
interest
in
John
F.
Kennedy.
I
did
well
on
the
paper,
but
that
is
not
why
this
paper
stands
out
so
much.
As
a
lover
of
history,
I
enjoyed
this
chance
to
combine
that
subject
with
personal
opinion.
I
was
not
merely
"spitting
out"
facts
from
a
textbook
and
trying
to
put
them
into
my
own
words,
but
I
was
combining
historical
events
with
how
I
felt.
I
was
able
to
use
"I"
in
addition
to
explaining
"why"
to
a
variety
of
questions.
If
ever
given
this
topic
today,
I
would
once
again
enjoy
it-
in
fact,
I
would
beg
to
do
a
paper
such
as
the
one
described
above!
However,
it
is
most
likely
that
doing
this
paper
again
would
probably
be
a
personal
project
of
my
own.
Ninth
grade
also
included
some
additional
positive
writing
experiences-
this
time
involving
my
English
class.
One
paper
assigned
to
the
class
had
to
include
some
research
on
a
possible
future
job.
I
wrote
a
perfect
paper
on
the
work
a
television
news
anchor
does.
I
felt
that
the
paper
was
complete
and
thorough,
but
I
was
still
shocked
at
the
"100%"
written
on
the
last
page.
However,
that
was
just
one
of
many
writing
experiences
I
recall
from
that
class.
For
the
last
few
weeks
we
worked
on
a
poetry
section
that
although
I
did
not
enjoy,
I
did
quite
well
in.
After
studying
a
particular
type
of
poem,
with
certain
rhythms
and
lines,
we
had
to
write
our
own
works.
If
the
teacher
was
especially
pleased
with
our
work,
she
would
put
a
star
on
the
top
of
our
papers
indicating
that
she
would
like
to
keep
them
for
display
in
her
room.
I
do
not
know
the
exact
number,
but
at
least
four
of
my
poems
were
returned
to
me
with
a
star
on
the
top.
However,
aside
from
the
limericks,
I
really
did
not
enjoy
writing
poetry.
There
was
no
feeling,
only
limits-
in
the
number
of
lines,
beats,
or
words.
It
was
not
natural,
I
thought,
to
be
so
constrained
when
trying
to
be
creative.
As
high
school
continued,
I
began
to
write
different
types
of
papers
other
than
simple
reports.
I
recall
writing
how-to
papers,
debates,
arguments,
and
in-depth
research
papers.
Although
I
had
only
recently
begun
writing
longer
papers,
I
felt
that
in
eleventh
grade
I
really
understood
how
to
combine
research
into
a
flowing
paper.
Before
my
senior
year,
I
traveled
to
Europe
for
a
short
time
and
was
again
encouraged
to
keep
a
diary.
I
wrote
about
the
places
I
visited
and
the
way
I
felt
throughout
the
trip.
When
I
returned,
I
enjoyed
going
back
to
my
diary
and
reliving
those
times.
It
was
then
that
I
decided
to
keep
a
diary
more
regularly.
I
was
not
going
to
write
my
everyday
activities;
rather,
I
would
concentrate
on
more
significant
experiences.
Unfortunately,
I
did
not
keep
this
up
for
long.
I
either
forgot
or
was
just
too
busy,
so
although
I
would
now
enjoy
reading
about
my
feelings
after
the
championship
softball
game
and
possibly
"reliving"
them,
I
just
have
faded
memories
and
pictures
that
cannot
express
feelings.
Again
and
again
I
have
started
to
write
a
diary,
but
I
have
not
been
able
to
keep
one
up
for
more
than
a
few
weeks.
My
failure
to
do
this
must
be
my
worst
experience
as
a
writer.
To
have
something
so
valuable
to
say,
even
just
to
myself,
but
to
be
too
lazy
to
write
it
down
is
a
major
regret
of
mine.
As
I
entered
my
senior
year,
I
felt
that
my
writing
skills
were
being
put
to
the
test-and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were.
Nevertheless,
I
feel
I
did
well
in
each
situation
I
was
faced
with.
SAT
1
and
SAT
2
tests
were
a
major
concern
for
me,
as
were
the
papers
I
completed
for
a
U.S.
government
class
I
took
at
Lafayette
College.
As
a
high
school
student
in
a
college
class,
I
was
extremely
worried
as
to
how
my
writing
measured
up;
fortunately,
my
papers
were
very
well
received.
One
writing
experience
I
am
not
very
proud
of
was
my
senior
English
paper,
completed
in
May
at
the
height
of
"senioritis."
My
attempt
to
tie
together
The
Great
Gatsbv
with
F.
Scott
Fitzgerald's
wild
life
in
the
"Roaring
Twenties"
was
a
poor
one
to
say
the
least.
I
passed
of
course,
but
I
was
not
especially
proud
of
that
work.
Although
my
last
paper
before
college
was
not
a
very
good
one,
I
still
felt
very
well
prepared
for
writing
at
Lafayette.
I
was
nervous
at
first,
but
after
writing
my
first
few
papers,
I
felt
quite
confident.
My
first
meeting
with
my
writing
associate
went
well,
and
I
left
the
meeting
feeling
that
I
was
a
capable
writer.
College
level
writing
forced
me
to
think
about
the
topic
I
was
working
on
and
to
attack
it.
Whether
I
was
writing
plays,
opinions,
or
research
papers,
I
focused
on
the
topic
and
made
sure
I
dealt
with
it
thoroughly.
I
answered
questions
or
defended
my
side
by
using
research
and
specific
quotes
that
applied.
My
professors
have
often
commented
on
my
ability
to
understand
and
use
relevant
material,
and
I
feel
I
have
done
this
well.
However,
my
best
college
writing
experience
has
been
writing
a
journal
for
a
particular
history
class.
After
reading
certain
selections,
an
entry
of
about
500
words
was
suggested.
Of
course
some
entries
were
below
the
suggested
amount,
but
many
ran
over.
Again,
here
I
was
combining
history
with
personal
feeling
and
thought.
I
enjoyed
the
assignments
and
after
reading
my
professor's
comments,
I
felt
I
made
quite
an
impression.
However,
I
often
worried
about
reaction
to
my
entries
and
I
occasionally
held
back
or
reworded
specific
parts.
I
do
not
know
exactly
why
I
did
this.
I
knew
what
I
wanted
to
say,
but
it
took
some
time
before
I
finally
felt
comfortable
putting
my
passionate
opinions
into
words.
It
was
after
I
entered
college
that
I
realized
how
much
I
enjoyed
writing.
With
a
close
friend
of
mine,
I
decided
that
I
would
like
to
begin
a
book
of
sorts.
It
would
combine
opinion,
experience,
and
fiction
all
into
one.
However,
this
second
attempt
at
personal
creative
writing
yielded
just
two
paragraphs,
as
mentioned
earlier.
I
cannot
say
exactly
why
I
continually
put
off
my
project,
but
for
some
reason
I
have.
There
are
so
many
ideas
that
I
would
like
to
put
into
writing,
but
I
hesitate
to
do
so.
Maybe
I
still
fear
criticism
of
a
work
that
is
so
personal.
Or,
perhaps
I
think
it
would
have
no
audience.
Another
reason
may
be
that
I
have
no
technical
writing
experience
with
a
magazine
or
newspaper.
Although
I
feel
that
writing
should
just
flow
naturally
from
the
writer,
selections
such
as
the
ones
we
had
to
read
for
the
upcoming
writing
associate
workshop
show
me
how
technical
writing
can
really
be.
It
seems
that
not
only
broad
aspects
such
as
tone,
but
small
details
such
as
word
choice
and
paragraph
length
are
intensely
examined
and
criticized.
I
do
believe
that
writing
must
have
order,
but
too
many
constraints
may
hold
a
talented
writer
back.
The
consideration
of
my
history
as
a
writer
has
forced
me
to
confront
major
issues
in
my
writing.
It
is
with
a
conscious
effort
that
I
will
now
attempt
to
get
back
to
my
"book,"
continue
my
journal,
or
at
least
write
some
letters
that
I
have
been
putting
off.
In
the
future,
I
hope
that
my
writing
"history"
will
contain
what
is
missing
from
my
history
now.
