The
College
Writing
Program

My
History
as
a
Writer
It
was
nothing
but
a
scribble
on
a
slate,
made
with
a
piece
of
soapstone
in
my
attempt
to
write
the
first
character
of
the
Devanagari
script,
?
OkaO.
I
have
vague
memories
of
writing
the
alphabets
on
the
cemented
area
around
the
community
well
at
my
ancestral
home.
Kids
used
that
spot
because
it
was
smoother
than
the
surrounding
paved
area
and
easier
to
write
on.
We
used
pieces
of
broken
red
bricks
to
write
them.
The
only
way
you
could
get
a
piece
of
chalk
to
write
with
was
if
someone
got
it
from
school
(which
rarely
happened).
So
the
older
kids
got
larger
pieces
of
brick
and
broke
them
into
small
pieces.
Of
course,
this
was
much
before
I
started
writing
the
letter
OAO.
Looking
back,
writing
was
never
emphasized
as
much
as
it
should
have
been
throughout
my
schooling.
It
made
at
least
some
sense
for
writing
in
Nepali
but
English?
For
the
longest
time,
I
never
knew
why
I
had
to
even
learn
English.
IOve
always
had
a
mandatory
English
class,
required
by
the
government.
Not
only
that,
the
teachers
insisted
on
using
English
for
other
subjects
as
well.
We
did
all
the
writing
in
English
for
science,
or
social
studies,
or
environment
studies
or
basically
any
class
that
was
not
Compulsory
Nepali.
That
did
not
mean
that
we
were
taught
completely
in
English.
Teachers
explained
the
material
to
us
in
a
mix
of
Nepali
and
English
but
all
the
exams
were
in
English.
Even
though
the
policy
was
to
encourage
English
as
a
medium
for
education,
it
was
difficult
for
that
to
be
implemented
in
a
country
like
Nepal
where
there
arenOt
enough
teachers
that
can
teach
well
in
English,
let
alone
writing
well
in
English.
I
remember
I
had
to
learn
how
the
format
for
writing
general
applications
and
letters.
Along
with
that,
I
also
had
to
learn
the
basic
five-paragraph
essay
format.
Those
were
sure
questions
in
the
terminal
exams
or
the
final
exams
and
you
could
get
away
with
it
by
memorizing
an
application
format
the
teacher
gave
and
modifying
it
enough
to
fit
the
prompt.
In
addition
to
those
questions,
other
questions
that
could
be
asked
in
the
exam
were
book
review,
movie
review
or
a
conversation.
You
could
easily
memorize
them
and
get
away
with
it.
Teachers
taught
us
how
to
write
but
never
really
taught
us
why
we
needed
to
learn
to
write.
Throughout
my
school
life
(K-12),
I
have
never
had
to
write
a
paper.
The
most
I
had
to
write
was
an
essay
that
was
capped
at
300
words.
In
8th
grade,
the
essays
were
to
be
200
words
and
250
in
10th
grade
and
300
in
12th.
That
was
the
extent
of
writing
I
had
to
do.
There
wasnOt
a
real
push
to
learn
how
to
write.
The
more
I
grew
up,
the
more
I
started
realizing
the
world
runs
with
English.
I
started
thinking
I
needed
to
write
better.
I
do
not
remember
exactly
when
or
how
this
happened
but
it
came
into
my
mind
that
writing
could
be
a
very
useful
tool.
I
wanted
to
improve
and
the
only
way
I
knew
was
what
I
had
heard
from
someone:
read
more.
Now,
I
had
never
read
a
novel
until
the
7th-8th
grade.
It
was
never
mandatory
for
class
but
I
wanted
to
read
a
story
so
I
got
an
abridged
version
of
NRobinson
CrusoeO
from
our
very
tiny
library
and
I
liked
it.
I
started
getting
more
and
more
books.
I
read
a
lot
of
abridged
versions
of
Charles
DickensO
work.
They
were
in
extremely
simple
English
and
were
probably
around
150
pages
long.
I
read
a
lot
of
novels
and
I
enjoyed
them
thoroughly.
I
wanted
to
get
a
membership
to
the
library
so
that
I
could
have
a
larger
selection
of
books
but
my
parents
would
not
let
me.
I
am
from
a
family
of
farmers
and
none
of
my
parentsO
generation
finished
high
school.
To
them,
reading
anything
besides
course
books
was
a
waste
of
time.
So
one
day,
I
tricked
my
dad
and
told
him
mom
was
okay
with
him
giving
me
Rs
250
($3.00)
for
the
library
membership.
I
immediately
dashed
off
to
get
the
membership
before
my
parents
had
a
chance
to
talk.
I
then
had
access
to
thousands
of
books
and
I
read
a
lot
of
them
and
I
read
them
fast.
I
would
finish
most
of
the
books
in
one
or
at
most
two
sittings
and
I
would
read
as
much
as
I
could.
I
believe
that
is
what
made
it
possible
for
me
to
be
slightly
above
average
in
writing.
I
remembered
the
way
the
books
were
written
and
try
to
use
that
while
writing
the
short
essays
I
had
to
write
during
exams.
I
thought,
that
was
the
only
way
to
write
better.
I
managed
to
get
my
library
membership
renewed
for
the
next
few
years
by
getting
better
grades
in
school.
I
had
gotten
better
at
writing
and
by
10th
grade,
I
would
get
the
highest
scores
in
English
in
my
class.
I
would
always
tell
my
parents
that
reading
novels
helped
and
that
is
why
they
let
me
keep
the
library
membership.
Somewhere
in
the
middle
of
10th
grade,
I
had
started
writing
essays
outside
of
class
and
gave
it
to
my
teacher
to
help
me
improve
writing.
He
was
very
happy
with
what
I
was
doing
since
students
generally
hated
writing.
Even
then,
all
I
had
to
write
was
250
words.
In
Nepal,
we
have
a
nation
wide
board
exams
in
10th
grade.
It
is
considered
the
most
important
exams
for
students.
I
had
gotten
the
highest
score
in
English
in
my
class
year
for
the
exam.
That
was
a
big
achievement
for
me.
The
first
time
I
had
felt
writing
was
fun
was
probably
in
12th
grade
because
I
usually
ended
up
getting
good
scores
in
exams
for
it,
even
in
Junior
College
(11th
and
12th
grade).
Then
came
the
most
important
piece
of
writing
I
had
ever
written
till
then:
the
application
essay
for
college
admissions.
My
brother
and
other
people
had
emphasized
that
application
was
the
key
for
admission
to
a
college.
I
needed
to
be
able
to
keep
people
interested
in
my
essay.
I
looked
back
into
my
short
life
and
what
was
significant
in
an
attempt
to
write
my
essay.
I
spent
two
months
writing
those
1200
words
with
some
of
the
advices
I
had
collected
over
the
years
in
the
back
of
my
head.
I
knew
I
had
to
put
in
details
and
try
and
make
the
reader
see
things
my
way,
I
needed
to
make
sure
every
word
in
the
essay
would
be
such
that
without
them,
the
essay
would
not
work.
I
had
never
felt
writing
was
hard
but
this?
I
started
sweating
from
my
teeth
(this
is
a
saying
in
Nepali
and
doesnOt
translate
well
in
English
but
thatOs
the
jest.
This
is
also
how
I
used
to
look
at
writing
in
English,
translating
from
Nepali).
I
had
to
write
something
that
would
either
make
or
break
my
future.
I
found
something
that
was
deeply
important
to
me
and
I
made
sure
I
showed
why
it
was
important
to
me.
I
worked
hard
to
get
people
thinking
what
I
wanted
them
to
think.
I
started
college
in
August
of
2010
and
had
my
first
writing
class:
FYS.
My
mind
was
blown
away.
I
had
to
read
a
book
for
the
class,
and
I
had
to
write
about
the
book.
Even
more
interesting
to
me
was,
it
did
not
involve
writing
at
all!
It
was
typing.
Up
until
this
time,
writing
meant
using
a
pen/pencil
and
a
piece
of
paper.
Here,
writing
somehow
included
typing
as
well.
Anyway,
I
wrote
my
first
paper,
met
with
the
WA
and
got
my
first
writing
grade:
a
B.
I
wasnOt
that
happy
with
it
but
a
lot
of
my
seniors
at
Lafayette
from
Nepal
got
their
worst
grades
in
writing,
so
I
used
the
same
excuse
to
console
myself.
I
felt
much
worse
when
I
received
the
second
paper
grade:
a
C+.
That
was
horrible
and
if
my
parents
had
found
out,
I
would
be
in
big
trouble.
I
went
and
talked
to
my
professor
about
it
and
she
said
sheOd
re-grade
my
paper
if
I
wanted
to
write
it
again.
I
decided
to
re-write
it
and
I
spent
two
weeks
writing
the
5-page
paper.
During
fall
break,
I
had
a
friend
of
mine
who
went
to
high
school
in
the
US
help
me
edit
the
paper.
I
was
once
NgoodO
at
writing
and
all
of
a
sudden,
I
was
getting
a
C
and
getting
help
trying
to
make
it
better.
The
professor
ended
up
giving
me
an
A
for
that
paper
and
I
decided
to
work
closely
with
the
professor
for
my
final
paper.
I
started
my
final
paper
much
earlier
than
other
students
and
met
my
professor
about
4-5
times
before
I
had
a
final
draft.
I
dreaded
writing
after
that
class.
All
my
confidence
was
shattered.
I
was
just
happy
that
I
only
had
to
take
two
more
writing
classes
as
an
engineer.
My
strength
in
high
school
was
now
my
worst
enemy.
I
knew
I
had
to
take
English
110
so
looked
for
something
that
I
had
some
clue
about.
I
read
through
all
the
class
descriptions
in
the
English
department
website
and
saw
a
class
about
online
social
networks.
IOm
a
guy
who
is
very
much
into
technology,
Internet,
and
cyberspace.
That
was
the
only
class
I
was
interested
in
so
I
was
all
ready
to
register
for
it
but
it
got
capped
before
I
could
register
for
it.
I
went
and
talked
to
the
professor
who
offered
the
class
but
he
said
he
couldnOt
add
me;
the
department
limited
the
class.
He
told
me
to
try
it
next
semester,
when
he
would
offer
it
again.
So
I
registered
for
it
for
Fall
2011.
After
my
first
class,
I
realized
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
social
networks
or
even
NworkO
which
was
another
topic
he
offered.
On
top
of
that,
he
said
IOd
have
to
write
3-4
papers
and
that
was
already
scaring
me
so
I
stayed
behind
at
the
end
of
class
and
talked
to
him.
I
told
him
I
had
never
written
any
papers
before
and
I
was
scared
to
death
at
the
thought
of
having
to
write
and
that
I
might
have
to
drop
the
class.
He
persuaded
me
not
to
drop
it
and
at
least
stick
with
it
for
the
two-week
add-drop
period.
I
decided
I
liked
the
class
and
I
stuck
with
it.
For
the
entire
semester,
I
met
the
professor
in
his
office
many
times
and
he
gave
me
a
lot
of
freedom.
I
did
not
have
to
stick
to
the
given
topic
and
I
usually
got
more
time
to
write.
I
also
went
over
my
paper
with
him
a
lot
and
received
my
first
A
in
writing.
That
was
an
A
I
had
to
work
super
hard
for.
I
decided
I
wanted
to
be
focus
on
being
a
better
writer
and
not
getting
the
grade
anymore.
So
then,
I
spent
the
semester
talking
to
him
and
trying
to
improve
my
writing
in
general.
I
did
a
lot
of
revisions
and
struggled
a
lot.
I
read
and
re-read
my
papers
and
made
sure
I
was
writing
from
the
heart.
I
had
to
be
able
to
reach
the
reader
and
I
ended
up
making
that
my
primary
goal
in
any
piece
of
writing.
I
had
come
to
believe
writing
is
just
a
tool
to
get
an
idea
across
people.
Its
main
purpose
was
communication
and
I
had
to
be
able
to
communicate
well
if
I
wanted
to
have
people
listen
to
me,
ever.
IOm
a
Mechanical
Engineering
major
and
as
far
away
from
humanities
as
it
could
possibly
get.
Even
then,
if
I
ever
wanted
to
be
a
good
engineer,
I
had
to
be
able
to
get
my
views
and
my
ideas
across
people
who
are
not
engineers.
That
was
why
I
wanted
to
be
better
at
writing.
My
English
professor
made
it
happen
for
me.
The
freedom,
encouragement
and
the
help
he
gave
helped
me
get
rid
of
the
fear
of
writing.
That
was
the
biggest
achievement
of
that
semester
for
me.
I
had
typed
over
20
pages
that
semester,
of
my
own
writing.
That
was
huge
for
me.
It
was
more
than
I
had
ever
written
through
out
high
school.
I
decided
to
take
my
VaST
with
the
same
professor
and
I
ended
up
with
the
same
great
experience.
I
got
pushed
to
write
better
and
got
all
the
help
I
needed.
I
was
finally
not
stressed
about
writing.
At
the
end
of
the
semester,
my
professor
asked
me
to
apply
to
become
a
writing
associate.
Never
in
a
million
years
would
I
have
imagined
myself
even
eligible
to
apply
for
a
position
like
that.
English
was
my
third
language
and
I
still
had
not
forgotten
my
FYS
experience
with
writing.
I
was
scared
to
apply
but
I
did
it.
I
took
it
as
an
opportunity
to
improve
my
writing
even
further.
There
is
always
room
for
improvement
and
in
my
case
the
room
was
huge.
I
had
to
do
everything
I
could
to
improve.
I
spent
the
summer
as
an
EXCEL
scholar
in
engineering.
My
summer
research
included
thermodynamic
and
economic
modeling
on
a
novel
system
for
a
carbon
neutral
fuel
production
system
and
writing
a
paper
on
it.
I
started
the
project
with
some
confidence
in
writing
but
soon
realized
writing
a
scientific
paper
was
completely
different
from
writing
a
paper
for
an
English
class,
way
more
different
than
I
had
imagined.
I
had
to
write
to
a
much
different
audience
and
make
assumptions
on
how
much
the
audience
knew.
I
was
writing
to
a
small
community
of
scientists
and
engineers
who
were
working
on
this
small
area
in
engineering.
Even
though
this
was
very
different
than
English,
my
experiences
in
English
110
and
VaST
helped
me
a
lot.
I
knew
better
about
what
information
to
put
and
how
to
put
it.
I
had
a
better
idea
of
how
to
build
a
paper.
I
would
say
my
history,
as
a
writer,
is
a
very
short
one.
My
first
year
in
college
was
a
disaster
in
terms
of
writing,
and
it
took
an
English
professor
who
would
not
give
up
on
a
student
to
show
me
the
joys
of
writing.
Even
though
the
papers
I
wrote
for
his
class
were
important,
the
class
and
the
discussions
I
had
with
him
shaped
me
as
a
writer
more
than
anything
else.
His
detailed
analysis
of
each
piece
of
writing
I
did
and
the
challenging
comments
did
all
the
work
and
I
attribute
everything
about
writing
that
I
have
to
him.
I
do
not
have
a
single
best
experience
as
a
writer
rather,
I
feel
like
my
entire
sophomore
year
was
an
experience
of
a
lifetime
as
a
writer.
I
went
through
change
that
college
is
meant
to
bring
and
it
was
only
possible
because
of
writing.
