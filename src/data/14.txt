Writing
bibliography
In
the
last
five
minutes
of
the
First
Year
Writing
Class
in
my
second
semester
at
Lafayette,
my
professor
returned
the
folder
with
my
last
paper
enclosed.
Nervously,
and
thinking
that
whatever
happens,
so
be
it,
I
opened
it.
On
a
piece
of
paper,
attached
at
the
end
of
the
essay,
I
read
something
like,
wonderful
job,
this
paper
is
exactly
what
I
anticipated.
Surprised,
I
closed
the
folder
and
smiled.
I
felt
that
I
have
come
a
long
way.
I
remember
my
first
essay,
back
in
elementary
school
in
Romania.
The
teacher
asked
us
to
write
an
essay
describing
our
past
summer
vacation.
After
only
having
told
us
that
an
essay
consists
of
three
parts,
introduction,
body,
and
conclusion
and
without
giving
further
details,
she
sat
down
and
watched
us.
In
my
essay,
I
described
everything
I
had
done
that
summer.
In
my
introduction,
I
stated
that
I
will
concentrate
on
my
summer
vacation,
the
body
of
the
paper
consisted
of
countless
unorganized
events
that
have
occurred,
and
my
conclusion
summarized
these
major
events.
Since
the
emphasis
in
a
Rumanian
school
has
always
been
on
grammar
and
sentence
structure,
my
essay
was
considered
relatively
good.
However,
I
felt
that
something
was
wrong
with
my
paper.
I
couldn't
pin
point
exactly
what,
but
I
felt
confused,
as
though
the
whole
paper
needs
to
be
completely
restructured.
After
the
5th
grade,
my
family
moved
to
Israel,
and
in
the
mean
while,
my
writing
skills
stagnated
because
I
lacked
the
possibility
of
participating
in
all
the
classes
due
to
my
Hebrew
speaking
deficiency.
Only
a
little
before
high-school
did
I
commence
to
take
all
the
classes
with
the
other
Israeli
students.
In
high-school,
we
developed
the
idea
of
a
paper.
We
were
told
that
we
should
not
just
write,
but
brain-storm,
and
put
our
ideas
on
a
piece
of
paper
first
and
then
organize
them
to
form
a
complete
essay.
Perhaps
because
I
was
not
experienced
with
essay
writing
since
in
Romania,
I
do
not
recall
spending
much
time
on
it,
I
simply
could
not
comprehend
the
idea
of
brain-storming.
Every
time,
I
was
supposed
to
brain-storm,
I
could
not
think
of
anything.
My
problem
was,
I
realize
now,
that
I
could
not
define
the
thesis.
Another
problem
that
I
had
was
with
the
length
of
the
paper.
My
professors
never
stopped
to
clear
this
topic,
so
I
never
had
the
chance
to
really
understand.
Although
I
learned
that
the
body
of
the
paper
should
be
organized
by
the
various
ideas,
and
each
idea
should
be
explained,
I
couldn't
visualize
how
a
paper
should
be
structured
in
terms
of
its
length.
Therefore,
my
10th
grade
logic
class
paper
was
a
total
disaster.
I
cannot
recall
the
topic
of
the
essay,
but
I
remember
that
it
was
an
opinion
paper.
The
length
was
not
given,
so
I
did
my
best
job.
I
remember
having
written
less
than
a
page,
on
a
topic
that
required,
I
learned
later,
at
least
five
pages.
I
had
an
introduction
sentence,
apparently
not
recognizing
yet
the
idea
of
an
introduction
paragraph,
one
paragraph
in
which
I
stated
my
opinion
and
the
reason
for
it,
and
a
conclusion
sentence,
which
of
course
restated
my
view.
I
was
partially
satisfied
with
it,
thinking
that
it
is
at
least
concise
and
organized.
I
thought
that
I
have
taken
all
the
things
that
I
have
heard
about
writing
a
paper
into
consideration.
I
did
not
have
a
lot
of
ideas
in
the
paper,
but
I
consoled
myself
by
saying
that
it
is
a
opinion
paper
after
all,
and
I
do
not
have
but
one
opinion.
The
results
were
appalling.
Not
only
did
I
receive
a
failing
grade,
but
my
morale
was
totally
destructed
after
hearing
the
professor
say
that
the
matter
was
very
serious,
and
if
I
do
not
try
to
improve
my
writing,
I
would
have
major
problems
in
college.
Following
this
incident,
I
decided
to
see
what
was
wrong
with
my
writing.
I
wrote
a
science
fiction
short
story,
and
I
took
it
to
my
English
teacher
to
tell
me
what
was
wrong
with
it.
She
told
me
that
I
have
interesting
ideas,
but
I
did
not
know
how
to
express
them
in
an
organized
matter
so
that
the
reader
understands.
She
told
me
that
when
I
write
an
essay,
I
should
think
of
the
reader
of
the
paper
and
ask
myself
at
any
point
if
I
were
the
reader
would
I
understand
what
is
written,
or
does
he
need
further
information.
She
was
an
American
English
teacher,
and
she
gave
me
an
article
which
explained
how
essays
are
written
in
the
United
States.
I
read
about
the
introduction
paragraph,
about
thinking
first
of
a
topic
and
then
jotting
down
the
ideas
that
come
to
mind
in
connection
to
that
topic,
about
organizing
the
ideas
that
I
have
thought
of
and
then
trying
to
expand
them
into
one
paragraph
or
more,
and
about
the
conclusion
paragraph.
In
the
following
paper
that
I
wrote,
I
tried
to
incorporate
all
that
I
have
learned
and
even
expand
it.
The
paper
that
I
wrote
was
an
extra
credit
essay
on
a
book
about
the
Holocaust
in
the
Second
World
War.
In
my
thesis,
I
did
not
think
of
one
major
topic,
but
of
three.
Before
writing
the
essay,
I
went
through
the
book
with
a
pencil
in
my
hand
trying
to
find
evidence
for
my
three
hypothesis.
After
I
found
evidence,
I
used
the
quotes,
and
I
expanded
the
ideas
by
giving
them
my
interpretation.
It
took
my
some
time
to
finish
it,
but
when
I
did,
my
teacher
read
it
and
loved
it.
I
got
my
A;
I
could
see
that
she
was
impressed.
Finally,
she
told
me,
I
had
a
better
idea
about
the
structure
of
a
paper
and
how
to
express
my
ideas
into
writing.
I
could
finally
feel
that
I
was
improving,
although
I
had
yet
to
learn
about
trying
to
make
logical
transitions
between
paragraphs,
and
giving
my
paper
a
sense
of
flow.
In
my
first
semester
at
Lafayette,
before
writing
my
first
essay,
I
thought
about
all
that
I
have
read
on
writing
a
paper
in
the
United
States.
After
reading
the
assignment,
I
carefully
thought
and
wrote
down
my
thesis.
Then,
I
listed
all
the
points
that
should
be
made,
and
expanded
them
into
ideas.
I
also
thought
of
a
conclusion,
taking
into
consideration
that
the
conclusion
should
not
only
repeat
what
was
already
said,
but
it
should
also
pose
a
question
or
introduce
an
novel
idea
in
order
to
leave
the
reader
pondering.
I
thought
that
my
essay
was
good
yet
I
did
not
get
an
A.
When
I
asked
my
professor
what
was
wrong,
he
told
me
that
the
essay
was
good,
only
I
had
to
work
more
on
the
transitions
between
paragraphs,
and
about
the
paper
as
a
whole
and
not
only
of
its
three
parts.
The
first
essay
of
the
second
semester
freshmen
year
of
the
first
year
writing
class
was
about
my
language
background.
Having
taken
into
consideration
all
the
previous
remarks
such
as
brain-storming,
developing
ideas,
first
draft,
final
draft,
introduction
paragraph
,
organization
of
the
paper,
organization
of
the
paragraphs,
the
conclusion
paragraph
and
also
the
transition
between
the
paragraphs
and
between
the
sentences
in
a
paragraph,
I
began
to
write
my
language
biography.
Just
like
after
writing
the
first
essay
in
the
first
year
seminar,
I
thought
I
wrote
excellently.
The
remarks
were
good,
but
again
I
seemed
to
have
overestimated
my
writing
capabilities.
The
paper
was
good,
I
had
done
a
good
job
organizing
my
ideas,
yet
there
was
something
missing
that
I
hadn't
anticipated
at
all:
punctuation.
My
professor
told
me
that
in
order
for
an
essay
to
be
considered
good,
it
cannot
lack
punctuation.
Lack
of
punctuation
reveals
lack
of
professionalism.
Disappointed,
but
understanding
that
I
have
yet
to
learn,
I
began
to
improve
my
punctuation.
The
last
essay
that
I
have
written
in
that
course
was
entitled,
Power,
beauty,
and
memories
of
Pardee.
I
worked
with
a
partner,
and
we
both
decided
to
make
it
as
good
as
possible.
It
took
us
a
long
time
to
finish
it.
The
final
draft
had
a
good
introduction;
it
included
a
thesis
statement,
the
plan
to
prove
it
throughout
the
paper,
and
also
enough
elements
to
catch
the
reader's
interest
and
captivation
from
the
beginning.
We
proved
our
point
eloquently
and
in
a
very
organized
manner.
The
essay
included
logical
deductions
and
transitions
between
ideas.
The
conclusion
was
perfect,
and
it
fulfilled
its
roles
to
conclude
the
paper
and
to
add
new
information
for
the
reader
to
assimilate
through
further
thinking
and
reading.
And,
of
course,
the
grammar
and
punctuation
were
perfect,
or
as
perfect
as
they
could
get.
Very
anxiously,
I
waited
for
the
results.
I
knew
we
did
a
thorough
job,
but
what
if
we
overlooked
something?
I
wouldn't
have
been
surprised
if
we
had,
after
all,
it
happened
to
me
every
time
I
wrote
an
essay.
My
partner
looked
confident,
but
I
couldn't
overcome
my
nervousness
until
I
had
the
folder
in
my
hand,
and
until
I
read
the
lines
the
professor
wrote
on
the
piece
of
paper
attached
at
the
end
of
the
essay.
We
got
our
A
which
we
deserved,
even
though
I
was
afraid
to
think
so.
I
have
learned
my
lesson,
and
I
knew
that
only
the
more
I
wrote,
the
better
my
writing
skills
would
become
in
time.
Even
though
I
could
write
well,
I
did
not
have
the
experience
other
people
do.
I
was
not
a
professional
writer.
I
also
knew
that
I
could
never
say
that
my
writing
was
perfect.
Even
now,
after
being
a
Writing
Associate
for
two
semesters,
I
cannot
say
so
because
there
is
always
room
for
improvement
and
expansion.
