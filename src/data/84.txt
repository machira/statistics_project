Literacy
Narrative
for
Returning
WAs
Over
the
past
year
I
have
grown
considerably
as
a
writer.
Whether
it
has
been
as
a
writing
associate
or
writing
for
a
class
or
for
a
publication,
each
new
writing
experience
has
been
a
challenge,
I
had
considerable
confidence
in
my
writing
at
the
end
of
my
first
year
but
over
the
course
of
my
sophomore
year
as
a
writing
associate,
I
often
found
myself
in
situations
where
I
had
to
question
rules
that
I
previously
felt
were
absolutes.
Due
to
these
situations
I
became
very
critical
of
my
writing.
As
a
sophomore
I
began
taking
more
classes
that
forced
me
to
take
a
different
approach
to
writing.
Throughout
two
government
classes
I
was
required
to
critically
read
material
and
then
to
concisely
present
a
well
defended
position
in
just
a
few
pages.
In
the
first
class
our
position
papers
were
written
after
we
had
an
understanding
of
all
the
events
that
had
transpired.
We
were
dealing
with
topics
such
as
World
War
I
and
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
Cold
War
so
when
writing
we
had
the
advantage
that
we
were
already
familiar
with
the
material.
However,
in
the
second
government
class
we
would
read
one
half
of
a
case
study
on
subjects
such
as
the
crisis
of
the
United
States
machine
tool
industry
in
the
mid
1980s,
and
then
we
would
write
a
position
paper
based
on
our
limited
background
of
the
issue
and
its
surrounding
circumstances.
This
made
the
writing
for
the
latter
class
much
more
challenging
since
not
only
were
we
forced
to
be
very
creative
with
our
answers
but
brevity
was
extremely
important.
The
greatest
challenge
for
me
was
to
present
my
ideas
in
a
brief
and
concise
manner,
while
still
maintaining
a
flowing
and
well
constructed
essay.
While
I
feel
that
I
was
able
to
adapt
my
writing
and
thus
address
the
challenge,
brevity
is
still
an
area
in
which
I
still
need
to
concentrate.
I
find
it
especially
hard
to
write
short
position
papers
because
of
the
multitude
of
information
that
could
be
used
but
cannot
be
included
due
to
limitations
of
length.
When
trying
to
be
brief
one
must
be
careful
that
they
do
not
leave
out
important
information
that
is
crucial
to
the
flow
and/or
the
argument
in
one's
paper.
Thus,
I
guess
the
really
hard
part
is
in
deciding
just
what
to
include
and
what
to
leave
out,
and
then
deciding
how
to
construct
the
paper
so
that
it
both
makes
sense
to
the
reader
and
is
well
substantiated.
I
find
it
interesting
that
one
of
the
most
common
problems
among
the
students
in
the
first
year
seminar
for
whom
I
was
a
writing
associate
was
in
writing
brief
and
concise
papers.
Some
people
did
not
use
enough
information
in
their
papers
but
many
wrote
too
much.
In
doing
so
they
lost
their
original
focus
and
their
papers
ceased
to
flow
well.
It
can
be
hard
to
read
one's
own
paper
and
point
to
areas
that
need
work,
but
it
is
sometimes
easier
to
pick
out
similar
problems
in
someone
else's
paper.
Consequently,
I
feel
that
my
writing
improved
because
after
seeing
the
mistakes
made
by
the
students
in
the
FYS,
it
became
less
difficult
for
me
to
find
the
same
problems
in
my
own
papers.
By
dealing
with
other
students
I
was
able
to
see
different
ways
in
which
students
corrected
the
same
mistake.
I
tried
to
give
students
suggestions
of
suitable
alternatives
to
their
mistakes
and
often
they
thought
of
ones
that
I
had
never
considered.
I
am
a
strong
believer
that
one's
vocabulary
and
writing
ability
will
grow
the
more
that
one
reads,
and
I
had
that
experience
when
I
read
students"
papers
and
met
with
them.
I
found
my
conferences
to
be
mutually
beneficial
as
I
learned
new
techniques
and
methods
of
improving
my
writing,
while
I
tried
to
the
same
for
the
students
that
I
met
with.
The
realization
that
sometimes
I
find
the
same
mistakes
in
my
writing
that
I
find
when
fm
working
as
a
writing
associate
was
a
bit
disconcerting
at
first.
I
worried
about
my
ability
to
help
other
students
if
my
writing
sometimes
exhibits
the
same
flaws.
Soon
I
realized
that
the
problem
was
that
I
approached
my
own
writing
in
a
manner
different
to
how
I
approached
other
people's
writing.
When
I
worked
with
other
students
I
had
the
mind
set
of
a
WA
but
I
was
not
using
that
mind
set
when
I
edited
what
I
wrote.
When
I
discovered
this
I
began
to
make
a
conscious
effort
to
approach
revising
and
editing
my
writing
the
way
I
would
approach
someone
else's.
When
I
look
at
research
papers
and
essays
that
I
wrote
freshman
year
and
compare
them
to
what
I
wrote
over
the
course
of
sophomore
year
I
can
tell
the
difference.
Even
though
I
still
need
to
work
on
lowering
the
lard
factor
in
my
writing,
I
can
see
that
my
writing
has
become
clearer
and
more
concise
since
I
became
a
writing
associate.
Anyone
going
to
a
writing
conference,
whether
it
is
the
writer
or
the
writing
associate
has
their
own
ideas
about
the
quality
of
the
written
work
and
what
grammatical
and
style
rules
cannot
be
broken.
Grammar
has
never
been
my
favorite
subject
but
as
a
writing
associate
last
year
I
hoped
that
my
knowledge
of
basic
grammar
would
be
enough
to
help
students.
During
my
first
conference
as
a
writing
associate
I
met
a
student
who
wrote
well
and
had
a
high
level
of
confidence
in
his
writing
ability.
The
conference
was
going
well
until
we
came
to
a
phrase
that
I
had
circled.
At
this
point
I
do
not
remember
what
I
believed
the
problem
to
be
but
when
I
brought
my
question
to
the
student's
attention
he
adamantly
stated
that
he
had
been
following
grammar
rules
that
he
had
learned
in
high
school.
Upon
consulting
Saint
Martin's
Handbook
I
found
that
in
that
particular
instance
the
student
I
was
meeting
with
was
correct.
The
fact
that
there
were
multiple
exceptions
to
the
rule
was
no
consolation
to
me.
I
had
been
snagged
by
a
rule
that
I
had
adhered
to
for
years
and
consequently
I
went
through
a
period
where
I
questioned
my
knowledge
of
writing
and
whether
or
not
I
could
help
others
improve
theirs.
One
of
the
hardest
lessons
of
life
is
that
no
matter
how
much
you
think
you
know
there
is
always
much
more
for
you
to
learn.
Eventually
I
had
to
accept
the
fact
that
there
was
no
way
that
I
can
possibly
know
all
the
answers
and
that
each
writing
experience,
whether
it
is
with
a
student
or
with
my
own
writing,
is
always
a
learning
experience
for
all
participants.
I
soon
found
out
that
I
do
indeed
have
something
to
offer
other
students.
Sometimes
I
would
run
across
a
strong
writer
that
only
needed
a
few
pointers
and
a
boost
in
self
confidence
more
than
anything
else.
However,
there
were
students
who
did
have
considerable
problems
with
their
writing.
One
student
was
an
Asian
student
who
had
only
been
exposed
to
the
English
language
for
two
years.
She
could
not
comprehend
the
reading
and
as
a
result
faced
a
lot
of
problems
when
she
was
required
to
write
papers.
She
had
difficulty
understanding
the
assignments
and
basic
sentence
structure
and
verb
agreement
were
too
advanced
for
her
in
her
writing.
I
found
the
biggest
obstacle
to
be
that
she
had
no
confidence
in
her
ability
to
learn
the
language.
I
had
several
extra
conferences
with
her
throughout
the
semester
and
I
referred
her
to
English
as
a
Second
Language.
Over
the
course
of
the
semester
I
and
her
FYS
professor
saw
her
writing
improve.
Even
though
she
received
a
D
in
the
class
as
her
mastery
of
English
improved
so
did
her
self
confidence,
and
as
a
result
so
did
her
writing.
The
fact
that
she
was
able
to
pass
the
class
at
all
showed
a
great
deal
of
dedication
on
her
part
and
I'm
happy
if
I
was
able
to
help
her
in
any
way.
Another
student
in
the
class
had
basic
problems
with
grammar
such
as
agreement
between
the
subject
and
the
verb
of
the
sentence.
His
writing
also
improved
over
the
course
of
the
semester
after
numerous
revisions
and
conferences.
My
most
rewarding
experience
as
a
writing
associate
came
during
spring
semester
(I
was
not
working
as
a
WA)
when
this
particular
student
asked
me
if
I
would
read
a
paper
he
had
written
for
English
110
and
to
point
out
any
problem
areas.
It
was
such
a
rewarding
experience
because
even
though
I
was
not
his
WA
anymore
he
valued
my
opinion
and
rather
than
my
chasing
him
down,
he
called
me.
Even
though
I
was
a
WA
for
only
one
semester
last
year
I
learned
a
considerable
amount
about
the
writing
process
and
how
to
help
people
through
it.
A
writing
associate
must
wear
many
hats.
Each
student
has
their
own
personality
and
their
own
set
of
writing
strengths
and
weaknesses.
In
large
part
the
hard
part
is
presenting
problems
in
such
a
way
that
the
student
does
not
become
defensive
and
hopefully
sees
the
revision
process
as
less
of
a
burden.
Each
writer
has
their
own
personal
writing
history
and
consequently
everyone
has
their
own
unique
style
that
defines
how
they
write.
When
I
was
a
freshman
I
had
a
WA
for
my
General
Biology
class
spring
semester.
Even
though
my
WA
meant
well
I
quickly
got
to
the
point
where
I
dismissed
most
of
what
she
told
me.
The
problem
was
not
with
the
content
of
my
paper
or
with
its
clarity.
The
problem
stemmed
from
the
fact
that
she
rearranged
almost
every
sentence
I
wrote
because
my
style
of
writing
differed
from
hers.
While
well
intentioned
she
did
not
realize
that
each
sentence
structure
that
she
changed
made
my
paper
sound
less
and
less
like
I
had
written
it.
I
no
longer
owned
my
paper
and
consequently
I
unfortunately
dismissed
almost
all
of
her
advice.
I
take
that
lesson
very
seriously
and
as
a
WA
I
always
try
to
refrain
from
imposing
my
personal
style
of
writing
upon
another
student.
Often
when
I
give
a
suggestion
that
I
feel
may
be
less
of
a
problem
and
more
of
a
difference
in
writing
styles,
I
explain
that
conflict
to
the
student.
Most
students
are
put
at
ease
because
they
still
feel
that
they
are
in
control
of
their
papers.
As
a
result
they
often
accept
my
suggestions
and
are
more
prone
to
ask
me
questions
about
what
they
wrote.
From
experience
I
can
see
that
if
a
student
feels
that
the
WA's
style
will
always
be
imposed
upon
them
when
they
ask
a
question,
the
often
will
not
ask
questions.
To
me
that
is
a
wasted
opportunity
since
the
objective
and
purpose
of
the
writing
associate
is
to
help
students
improve
their
writing.
If
they
are
too
afraid
of
the
answer
to
ask
the
question
they
will
never
learn
and
grow.
In
a
matter
of
days
the
school
year
will
begin
again.
I
am
eager
to
again
meet
with
first
year
students
and
to
help
ease
them
into
writing
at
the
collegiate
level.
I
have
learned
a
lot
about
writing
over
the
course
of
the
past
year.
Because
I
dealt
with
students
with
varying
levels
of
writing
ability
who
had
different
strengths
and
weaknesses
I
have
learned
how
to
deal
with
various
problems
students
face
both
in
their
papers
and
in
their
approach
to
the
writing
process.
I
have
also
seen
how
students
react
to
the
writing
process,
depending
on
how
I
react
to
their
work.
Even
when
they
wrote
weak
papers,
I
found
that
it
always
helps
to
present
the
problems
in
a
way
so
that
the
student
dreads
the
revision
process
a
little
less.
I
have
also
learned
techniques
to
help
ascertain
how
to
relate
to
each
individual
student.
Some
students
could
find
their
mistakes
if
I
told
them
to
read
their
papers
aloud
but
would
miss
the
mistakes
if
they
read
them
silently.
Others
could
spot
their
mistakes
if
someone
else
read
their
papers
aloud
and
still
others
found
most
of
their
mistakes
if
they
took
the
time
to
proofread
their
papers.
I
have
learned
a
considerable
amount
about
the
writing
process
over
the
past
year
and
how
to
relate
that
process
to
others
in
a
way
that
makes
writing
and
revising
their
papers
less
tedious.
When
I
return
to
Lafayette
in
the
fall
I
bring
those
skills
and
others
which
I
learned
over
the
course
of
last
year
to
the
Comprehensive
Writing
Program.
Having
learned
from
past
mistakes
I
hope
to
help
others
improve
their
writing
as
I
continue
to
improve
mine.
