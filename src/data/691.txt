When
I
think
of
my
history
as
a
writer,
I
canOt
help
but
think
how
typical
it
must
be.
Writing
has
never
played
a
major
role
in
my
life.
Essays
and
research
papers
for
school
were
completed
begrudgingly
the
night
before
they
were
due.
A
four
to
six
page
paper
usually
meant
four,
at
most,
for
me.
Although
I
received
good
grades
on
my
writing
assignments,
I
didnOt
enjoy
them
very
much.
Eventually,
though,
I
began
to
enjoy
writing
and
improving
my
writing
skills.
As
a
professor
at
Lafayette
made
clear
to
me
during
my
freshman
orientation,
no
life
is
ordinary.
There
are
unique
experiences
I
have
had
in
my
life
that
changed
me
from
an
acquiescent
student
into
the
interested
writer
I
am
today.
My
earliest
memories
of
writing
go
back
to
elementary
school.
Every
week
my
class
was
given
a
group
of
vocabulary
words
to
study.
To
learn
these
words,
we
were
told
to
write
them
each
ten
times,
place
them
in
alphabetical
order,
and
use
each
of
them
in
a
sentence.
Writing
each
of
them
in
a
sentence
was
always
my
favorite
part.
I
think
the
thing
I
liked
so
much
about
writing
the
sentences
was
the
fact
that
with
each
new
sentence,
I
could
write
about
something
entirely
different
from
the
last.
The
only
guideline
was
that
these
sentences
had
to
use
the
word
correctly.
Most
of
my
classmates
wrote
basic
sentences
that
simply
finished
the
assignment
fastest.
I,
however,
took
this
opportunity
to
be
creative
and
tried
to
see
how
different
I
could
make
each
sentence.
This
is
when
I
started
to
expand
my
vocabulary
and
understand
how
to
use
words
correctly
and
effectively
in
different
styles.
Throughout
elementary
school,
if
I
needed
help
with
a
writing
assignment,
my
mother
was
ready
and
willing.
I
can
remember
sitting
at
a
table
in
my
kitchen
with
my
pencil
and
notebook
writing
paragraphs
and
short
essays
I
was
assigned.
While
my
mother
cooked
dinner
for
the
family,
I
would
usually
read
what
I
had
written
aloud
to
her
and
ask
how
it
could
be
improved.
She
would
help
me
think
of
ways
to
restructure
sentences
without
telling
me
what
to
write.
This
may
have
been
my
first
exposure
to
the
facilitative
approach.
These
proofreading
sessions
with
my
mother
played
an
important
role
in
my
development
as
a
writer.
From
them,
I
learned
to
proofread
for
myself
and
this
helped
me
at
every
level
of
writing.
My
ability
to
write
well
and
catch
my
own
errors
was
a
great
asset
to
me
during
my
early
writing
experiences.
Once
I
got
to
high
school,
though,
I
found
that
simply
being
able
to
write
correctly
wasnOt
enough.
Research
papers
and
longer
essays
required
more
complex
sentences
and
better
style
to
make
my
message
clear.
Knowing
how
to
structure
an
essay
or
research
paper
effectively
usually
made
the
difference
between
a
good
and
great
paper.
Surprisingly,
I
learned
the
most
about
structuring
a
paper
from
speaking,
not
writing.
In
high
school,
I
joined
the
Speech
and
Debate
team.
It
was
an
activity,
much
like
writing,
that
I
did
not
enjoy
until
it
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
be
creative.
At
first,
I
competed
in
an
event
in
which
I
would
memorize
and
deliver
well-known
speeches
given
by
politicians
and
celebrities.
This
soon
began
to
feel
repetitive
and
unrewarding,
so
when
I
was
given
the
chance
to
compete
in
Extemporaneous
Speaking,
an
event
in
which
students
were
given
thirty
minutes
to
prepare
a
seven
minute
speech
on
a
randomly
chosen
current
events
topic,
I
did
not
hesitate
in
taking
it.
Initially,
I
was
nervous.
Not
only
did
I
have
to
speak
for
seven
minutes,
I
had
no
idea
what
I
would
be
speaking
about
until
thirty
minutes
before
I
started.
My
speech
had
to
be
knowledgeable,
clear,
and
thoughtful
in
order
to
compete
with
other
students.
I
was
unsure
where
to
start
the
process
of
writing
such
a
speech
with
so
little
time,
but
my
coach
relieved
this
anxiety
by
saying
itOs
just
like
writing
an
essay.
The
task
seemed
simple
when
it
was
said
in
those
terms.
Of
course
I
would
not
be
able
to
write
an
entire
seven-minute
speech
in
thirty
minutes,
I
reassured
myself.
Instead,
just
like
an
essay,
I
constructed
the
outline
of
the
speech
first,
and
expanded
upon
my
main
arguments
as
I
spoke.
The
goal
of
every
speech
given
in
this
event
was
to
persuade
the
judges
that
the
stance
you
have
chosen
to
take
on
the
subject
was
correct.
To
do
so,
arguments
made
in
the
speech
had
to
be
backed
by
trusted
sources
and
facts
taken
from
books,
newspapers,
magazines,
and
journals.
It
was
not
enough
to
simply
recite
these
facts,
though,
they
had
to
be
presented
in
a
manner
that
made
the
argument
easy
to
understand
and
pleasing
to
listen
to.
Therefore,
structure
is
paramount
to
speech
writing
and
delivery.
Through
preparing
countless
speeches
I
learned
how
to
organize
my
argument
in
the
best
way
possible.
This
meant
judging
how
strong
each
of
my
points
were
and
placing
weaker
points
in
the
middle
of
my
speech
and
trying
to
start
and
finish
on
more
significant
and
memorable
points.
I
try
to
incorporate
this
judgment
into
my
writing
today.
During
my
time
in
this
event,
I
was
often
told
that
my
analysis
was
the
strongest
feature
of
my
speeches.
This
is
because
while
other
students
would
find
plenty
of
pertinent
information
to
use
regarding
their
topic,
they
usually
did
not
fully
understand
or
explain
the
importance
of
the
information
in
terms
of
their
argument.
Whenever
I
cited
information
in
my
speeches
I
would
make
sure
the
citation
was
explained
and
made
a
connection
between
it
and
my
argument.
This,
I
now
realize,
is
how
I
really
learned
how
to
NframeO
a
quotation
and
write
better
essays
and
research
papers.
Speech
and
Debate
made
another
large
impact
on
my
writing
with
introductions.
My
favorite
part
about
every
speech
I
gave
was
the
introduction
because
the
introductions
did
not
need
to
follow
a
set
path.
It
was
the
one
part
of
the
speech
in
which
creativity
could
fully
shine
through.
During
the
preparation
of
my
speeches,
after
I
had
my
main
points
and
arguments
outlined,
I
would
assess
what
the
central
point
of
my
speech
was
and
form
an
introduction
that
related
to
it.
I
could
be
speaking
on
the
condition
of
ChinaOs
economy
and
start
my
speech
by
talking
about
baseball,
and
somehow
make
it
work.
I
always
tried
to
have
a
thoughtful
and
creative
introduction
that
would
help
my
argument
and
grab
the
attention
of
my
audience.
In
my
writing
I
try
to
do
the
same
thing
if
it
is
appropriate.
In
high
school,
there
werenOt
many
opportunities
for
advanced
college
level
writing.
As
an
underclassman
I
had
to
write
a
research
paper
once
or
twice
each
year
but
it
wasnOt
until
senior
year
that
I
got
to
write
higher-level
analytical
papers
more
often.
Once
I
was
given
this
opportunity
to
write
more
often,
I
started
to
find
more
enjoyment
in
writing.
AP
English
was
my
favorite
class
senior
year
because
it
challenged
me
to
write
critically
about
great
literature
for
the
first
time.
Instead
of
just
reading
short
stories
and
novels
and
reciting
facts
from
the
plot
to
pass
tests,
I
had
to
interpret
the
authorOs
meaning
and
the
real
purpose
of
the
work.
As
my
classes
began
to
take
writing
more
seriously,
so
did
I,
and
I
began
to
enjoy
the
challenges
they
offered.
My
AP
English
teacher
was
always
very
encouraging
of
my
writing
and
helped
me
develop
my
skills.
For
every
compliment
he
gave
to
a
studentOs
writing,
he
also
offered
a
way
for
the
student
to
improve
upon
the
strengths
of
his
or
her
writing.
He
was
willing
to
spend
extra
time
with
students
to
help
them
with
writing.
Because
of
his
commitment
to
helping
his
students,
my
writing
greatly
improved
during
my
senior
year
of
high
school
and
I
was
able
to
come
to
college
with
AP
credit
in
English.
Although
my
writing
had
definitely
improved
during
my
senior
year,
I
was
still
unsure
whether
I
was
prepared
to
write
at
the
college
level.
My
friends
who
had
already
completed
a
year
of
college
would
come
home
and
tell
me
horrible
stories
of
writing
multiple
papers
in
a
week
and
sometimes
being
assigned
twelve
or
even
twenty
page
papers.
I
had
never
written
anything
longer
than
eight
pages
during
high
school
so,
needless
to
say,
I
was
worried.
When
I
arrived
at
college,
though,
I
found
that
it
wasnOt
as
bad
as
I
thought.
I
remember
writing
my
first
five
page
paper
for
a
world
history
class
first
semester
and
having
no
idea
what
to
expect
to
hear
back
from
the
professor.
Fortunately,
he
had
individual
conferences
with
all
the
students
in
the
class
about
the
papers
and
said
he
actually
enjoyed
reading
my
paper.
Of
course,
the
paper
was
far
from
perfect
but
I
felt
relieved
to
know
I
was
on
the
right
track
with
my
first
writing
assignment
in
college.
From
that
point
on
in
my
freshman
year,
part
of
me
was
excited
to
write
more
and
see
if
I
could
do
even
better.
My
best
experience
as
a
writer
came
later
on
in
the
first
semester.
For
my
First
Year
Seminar
class
on
America
at
War
in
the
20th
Century,
I
had
to
interview
a
veteran
and
write
a
paper
describing
his
or
her
service,
thoughts
and
feelings
during
service,
and
the
context
in
which
it
took
place.
Many
students
had
plans
to
interview
grandparents
or
other
relatives
who
were
in
the
military.
At
first,
I
was
hesitant
because
I
didnOt
know
of
any
living
member
of
my
family
who
had
served
in
the
military.
After
talking
to
my
father
about
this,
however,
I
learned
that
I
had
a
great
uncle
who
served
in
an
anti-aircraft
artillery
battalion
in
World
War
II.
Not
only
was
he
still
living,
but
his
home
was
only
a
few
minutes
away
from
mine.
During
the
war
had
seen
D-Day
and
most
of
the
allied
advance
across
Europe.
I
would
have
never
known
this
had
it
not
been
for
this
writing
assignment.
The
interview
went
very
well
and
gave
me
plenty
of
information
to
write
a
good
paper.
When
I
got
the
paper
back
from
my
professor,
he
said
it
was
the
best
out
of
my
class.
I
felt
very
accomplished
after
that
assignment
because
I
got
to
learn
about
my
family
history
and
received
a
good
grade
to
go
along
with
it.
I
usually
donOt
share
my
writing
with
family
but
since
many
members
of
my
family,
like
me,
were
unaware
of
the
extraordinary
things
my
great
uncle
had
done
during
the
war,
many
of
them
read
my
paper
over
the
holidays
and
were
very
happy
that
I
interviewed
him.
Until
college,
I
never
realized
how
much
I
could
enjoy
writing.
As
a
younger
student,
I
treated
writing
assignments
as
simply
required
tasks
I
needed
to
complete
to
get
through
school.
As
I
got
older,
though,
I
began
to
see
that
writing
can
be
interesting
and
sometimes
even
exciting.
Experiences
like
after-school
proofreading
with
my
mother,
preparing
speeches,
analyzing
literature
for
the
first
time,
and
seeing
my
professors
and
family
react
positively
to
my
writing
have
made
me
the
writer
that
I
am
today.
I
hope
that
I
can
help
others
start
to
enjoy
it
as
well.
