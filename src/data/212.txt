MY
HISTORY
AS
A
WRITER
Writing
has
always
one
of
my
passions.
Even
in
my
earliest
memories,
I
remember
enjoying
putting
words
on
paper
to
convey
my
thoughts.
As
a
child,
I
was
introduced
to
creative
writing
and
poetry,
the
forms
of
writing
I
am
still
most
comfortable
with.
In
middle
school,
I
learned
how
to
write
essays
on
history.
A
few
years
later,
my
writing
underwent
a
radical
change
when
I
learned
how
to
write
critical
essays.
This
learning
series
continued
through
my
first
year
at
college,
when
I
realized
that
there
were
still
many
styles
of
writing
which
I
had
yet
to
perfect.
As
a
whole,
therefore,
my
history
as
a
writer
has
been
one
of
constant
practice
punctuated
by
several
revelatory
experiences.
Being
the
son
of
an
English
major,
I
was
taught
to
read
at
a
very
early
age.
I
remember
small
hardback
books
with
pictures
of
bright
animals
and
apples
ana
the
like.
My
parents
would
even
play
reading
games
with
me;
most
of
these
games
involved
reading
words
written
on
scraps
of
paper.
Until
my
first
year
at
school,
however,
I
focussed
mainly
on
reading,
not
writing.
For
some
reason,
I
had
not
completely
associated
the
act
of
writing
with
that
of
reading
-
as
a
result,
I
rarely
wrote
as
an
exercise
in
itself.
When
I
started
Kindergarten,
I
found
I
was
expected
to
be
able
to
write
as
comfortably
as
I
read.
I
had
to
work
to
bring
my
ability
to
write
to
the
level
of
my
reading
capabilities,
an
equality
that
I
take
for
granted
now.
I
still
remember
being
the
first
to
finish
reading
a
sentence,
but
one
of
the
slower
ones
when
it
came
to
copying
the
sentence
into
my
notebook.
After
extensive
practice,
I
managed
to
bring
my
reading
and
writing
skills
to
a
level;
fortunately,
this
resulted
from
an
improvement
in
my
writing
skills,
not
in
the
deterioration
of
my
reading.
This
experience
as
a
five-year
old
in
Kindergarten
helped
me
the
solid
writing
base
-
with
proper
spelling,
grammar,
and
syntax
-
which
I
would
be
able
to
expand
upon
in
further
years.
A
major
turning
point
in
my
writing
career
came
soon
after
I
had
acquired
these
basic
skills.
In
Kindergarten,
we
were
taught
how
to
write
series
of
simple
sentences,
mainly
copied
from
a
'Dick
and
Jane'
primer.
I
had
never
written
a
creative,
unique
piece
in
all
my
hours
spent
writing
in
Kindergarten.
This
changed,
however,
when
I
was
on
vacation
with
my
parents
one
day.
Being
bored,
I
picked
up
the
hotel-supplied
writing
pad
and
pen
in
the
room
and
decided
to
practice
my
writing.
Instead
of
regurgitating
the
'Dick
and
Jane'
sentences,
however,
I
wrote
a
story
about
a
crab
and
a
turtle.
Although
the
story
itself
had
all
the
earmarks
of
a
typical
six-year
old's
writing,
my
parents
loved
it
and
encouraged
me
to
write
a
'crab
and
turtle'
series,
which
I
did
over
the
next
six
months.
Throughout
elementary
school,
I
would
write
short
stories
on
a
range
of
topics
and
people.
My
discovery
of
creative
writing
was
a
tremendous
gift.
First,
it
kindled
a
desire
in
me
for
knowledge;
I
was
always
looking
for
new
information
I
could
include
in
my
stories.
I
also
began
to
read
much
more,
mainly
to
find
ways
to
polish
and
add
to
my
prized
stories.
Finally,
the
constant
writing
helped
me
perfect
my
basic
knowledge
of
English
grammar
and
spelling.
That
one
short
story
written
in
a
hotel
room
ignited
an
explosive
passion
for
writing,
a
passion
that
still
exists
in
me.
The
next
writing
revelation
came
in
third
grade,
where
I
was
introduced
to
the
world
of
poetry.
Miss
Wickstrand,
my
teacher,
gave
the
class
a
deceptively
simple
assignment
:
to
write
a
poem
about
a
person
or
an
animal.
My
first
reaction
was
disbelief
-
how
could
Miss
Wickstrand,
a
seemingly
sane
and
sensible
woman,
assign
us
something
so
pointless?
Over
the
course
of
a
few
days,
I
made
it
clear
that
I
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
project.
But
every
time
I
broached
the
subject,
Miss
Wickstrand
nodded
knowingly,
and
told
me
just
'to
try
it
and
see
what
happens.'
In
the
end,
it
was
the
childish
stubbornness
of
a
seven
year
old
student
against
the
determination
of
an
experienced
third
grade
teacher,
and
obviously,
I
lost.
I
had
to
write
the
poem
on
pain
of
getting
an
'Unsatisfactory'
grade
on
my
report
card.
Later
that
week,
I
was
struggling
to
find
an
idea
for
a
poem
-
I
finally
decided
that
I
would
halfheartedly
put
some
words
on
paper
and
be
done
with
the
hated
assignment.
As
I
wrote,
however,
my
opinions
about
poetry
began
to
change.
Although
the
poem
I
finally
submitted
was
slightly
mundane
and
trite,
it
opened
my
eyes
to
the
wonders
of
poetry.
I
realized
that
I
could
think
differently
and
express
myself
through
a
radically
new
style
of
language.
I
could
move
beyond
writing
simple
short
stories
or
class
assignments
and
explore
a
new
dimension
of
writing.
Now,
I
am
an
avid
poetry
fan
-
I
find
it
invigorating,
challenging,
and
relaxing
at
the
same
time,
a
combination
few
other
activities
offer
me.
In
addition,
analyzing
poetry
has
helped
my
critical
writing
skills;
the
intuition
and
the
perception
needed
in
reading
and
writing
poetry
are
easily
transferred
to
other
forms
of
writing,
thereby
making
my
papers
richer
and
more
well-rounded.
Without
the
wisdom
of
Miss
Wickstrand,
my
writing
would
not
be
nearly
as
developed
as
it
is.
The
next
formative
stage
in
my
writing
skill-building
came
with
my
introduction
to
non-fiction
assignments.
Until
seventh
grade,
I
had
concentrated
on
writing
wholly
fictional
and
often
very
elaborate
flowery
stories
and
poems.
In
seventh
grade,
however,
I
was
confronted
with
the
daunting
task
of
writing
an
essay
about
the
decline
of
the
Bronze
Age.
I
found
it
very
difficult
to
switch
to
the
more
formal
style
required
for
historical
writing,
but
my
teacher
was
nice
enough
to
help
me
bridge
the
gap.
By
ninth
grade,
I
could
write
essays
on
history
without
much
difficulty,
especially
when
the
assignment
called
on
us
to
report
by
rote
a
series
of
facts.
Looking
back,
I
realize
that
the
history
essays
introduced
me
to
non-fiction
essay-writing
in
a
very
rudimentary
way.
Although
I
did
not
learn
how
to
critically
analyze
topics,
I
became
grounded
in
the
basic
principles
of
writing
informative
essays.
In
eleventh
grade,
I
improved
on
my
history
essay
skills
to
reach
a
competent
level
of
critical
writing.
The
course
which
contributed
most
to
this
improvement
was
my
Advanced
Placement
English
class.
After
failing
my
first
two
class
assignments,
I
realized
that
I
needed
to
adapt
my
writing
style
to
fit
the
model
of
critical
writing.
My
teacher
told
me
that
although
my
ideas
were
excellent,
I
was
having
trouble
transferring
them
efficiently
to
my
essays.
After
having
a
conference
with
this
teacher,
I
realized
that
my
entire
approach
to
critical
writing
was
inadequate.
My
written
analyses
tended
to
be
incomplete,
my
perceived
audience
was
not
clearly
defined,
my
paragraph
structure
arbitrary,
and
my
conclusions
wordy
and
redundant.
Through
the
year,
however,
I
began
to
discover
the
ins
and
outs
of
elegant
analytic
writing
and
the
need
for
a
highly
organized
and
logical
structure.
Through
extensive
practice
-
my
teacher
acting
as
a
well-meaning
taskmaster
-
I
was
consistently
able
to
produce
well-written
essays,
as
judged
by
eleventh-grade
standards.
My
eleventh
year
of
school,
thus,
was
an
extremely
important
development
in
my
history
as
a
writer.
The
final
stage
in
my
journey
to
being
a
competent
writer
came
during
my
first
year
at
college.
Although
my
last
two
years
in
high
school
had
helped
me
find
a
comfortable
style
of
analytical
writing,
I
still
had
had
very
little
practice
with
other
types
of
writing.
Coming
into
college,
I
felt
confident
that
my
previous
writing
experience
would
be
enough
to
see
me
through
any
college
essays.
My
introduction
to
technical
essays
took
place
when
I
signed
up
for
an
engineering
class
:
I
had
to
write
a
15-page
technical
report
on
desalination.
Even
after
researching
and
collecting
appropriate
material,
I
was
unsure
as
to
how
I
could
proceed.
I
consulted
extensively
my
guide
to
technical
writing
to
learn
how
to
organize
my
paper.
The
assignment
was
a
big
blow
to
my
ego,
since
it
made
me
realize
that
my
writing
skills
were
still
inadequate.
The
report,
therefore,
was
a
learning
experience
-
I
had
to
dismantle
my
preconceptions
and
conventions
based
on
critical
writing
and
adopt
an
entirely
new
form
of
conveying
information.
In
the
end,
with
a
slightly
bruised
ego
but
a
large
amount
of
newly-gained
experience,
I
finished
the
report.
This
episode
was
characteristic
of
my
college
writing
experience
:
the
realization
that
I
have
mastered
only
a
few
styles
of
writing,
but
I
have
the
opportunities
to
learn
many
more.
My
natural
talent
as
a
writer
has
been
honed
and
trained
over
eighteen
years
to
the
point
where
I
am
comfortable
in
a
variety
of
styles.
However,
my
past
scholarly
experiences
have
also
shown
me
that
I
many
more
eye-opening
events
waiting
for
me
:
I
am
not
a
complete
writer
yet.
In
the
future,
I
aim
to
immerse
myself
in
a
host
of
different
writing
styles
and
exercises
in
order
to
gain
a
clearer
view
of
writing
as
a
whole.
Although
I
will
never
completely
master
the
human
tool
of
writing,
I
plan
to
challenge
myself
as
much
as
possible,
to
continue
the
series
of
experiences
that
have
brought
me
to
where
I
am
today
as
a
writer.
