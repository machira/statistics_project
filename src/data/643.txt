Writing
and
WAing
This
past
year
was
quite
a
whirlwind
of
writing
and
conferences.
Juggling
my
normal
course
load
became
trickier
with
the
addition
of
fitting
in
conferences
and
reading
papers.
After
becoming
a
WA,
my
writing
process
has
not
really
changed.
However,
I
have
become
even
more
critical
of
my
own
writing.
Often
times,
I
will
write
a
piece
and
hold
a
mock
WA
conference
in
my
head.
I
wonder
to
myself
if
my
thesis
is
strong
enough
and
well
supported
throughout
my
writing.
I
wonder
if
there
is
too
much
summary
in
my
piece
and
not
enough
analysis.
If
anything,
I
would
say
that
being
a
WA
affected
my
writing
much
more
in
my
second
semester
than
my
first
semester.
This
is
due
to
the
differences
between
the
classes
that
I
was
WAing
and
the
classes
that
I
was
taking
over
the
two
semesters.
The
first
semester
I
was
both
in
and
out
of
my
comfort
zone
with
regards
to
the
types
of
writing
that
I
was
expected
to
do.
I
was
definitely
in
a
foreign
land
while
taking
Psychology.
As
a
die-hard
history
and
language
major
I
was
only
trying
to
fulfill
my
lab
science
requirement.
I
am
used
to
writing
for
a
history
or
politics
class,
or
even
in
a
foreign
language.
In
those
classes
I
have
the
freedom
to
write
basically
how
I
want
so
long
as
there
is
a
structure
to
my
essay
and
organization.
In
Psychology,
I
had
to
write
a
lab
reports,
which
I
absolutely
detested.
Every
part
of
the
lab
report
had
its
own
set
section
and
the
tiniest
details
could
not
be
out
of
place.
Granted,
I
always
have
felt
that
I
have
had
some
issues
with
organization,
but
my
problems
grew
infinitely
when
dealing
with
whether
or
not
something
belonged
in
the
discussion
or
results
section,
for
example.
Furthermore,
I
had
to
deal
with
one
of
my
other
enemies,
tense.
I
am
not
the
best
at
finding
or
even
writing
without
the
passive
voice;
however,
I
found
it
incredibly
hard
to
try
to
force
myself
to
write
in
the
passive
voice
at
all
times.
My
WA
training
and
weekly
staff
meetings
definitely
helped
me
out
with
this
class,
though.
Learning
from
training
and
through
conferences
what
sorts
of
questions
helped
writers
improve
their
pieces
was
a
great
help
for
tackling
the
scientific
writing
for
this
class.
I
was
able
to
receive
more
help
from
my
PLA
because
I
learned
how
to
phrase
questions
or
what
sorts
of
questions
to
ask
to
refine
my
piece.
For
example,
I
could
show
him
a
section
of
my
lab
report
and
ask
if
it
was
sufficiently
original
because
of
having
to
incorporate
some
set
phrases
and
equations
about
the
results.
Additionally,
my
WA
training
was
very
helpful
because
my
PLA
was
only
allowed
to
read
short
sections
of
my
lab
report
and
only
to
answer
specific
questions.
Thus,
I
essentially
had
to
WA
my
lab
report
to
find
areas
about
which
I
had
questions.
Then,
I
could
be
prepared
for
my
meeting
with
my
PLA
and
get
the
most
out
of
my
time
with
him.
The
other
forms
of
writing
that
I
encountered
in
the
first
semester
were
more
within
my
comfort
areas.
I
was
taking
two
history
courses
that
required
me
to
upload
nightly
reflections
about
our
readings
and
class
lectures
on
moodle.
That
was
as
simple
as
could
be
for
me
because
it
was
informal
and
elementary
history
writing.
All
I
had
to
do
was
make
a
few
connections
between
what
we
had
read
and
what
we
had
talked
about
in
class.
But,
I
also
ended
up
having
two
writing
projects
for
those
classes,
in
a
sense.
For
one
class
I
had
to
write
a
book
summary
and
review.
This
assignment
did
nothing
to
change
my
writing
style,
but
it
was
a
helpful
experience
because
in
my
second
semester
I
had
to
WA
a
similar
assignment.
I
was
more
able
to
understand
the
assignment
as
well
as
ask
more
in
depth
questions
about
it
after
having
essentially
done
it
myself.
The
only
other
NwritingO
assignment
that
I
had
for
my
history
classes
was
the
twenty
page
final
exam
for
my
Imperial
Russian
history
class.
That
was
probably
a
low
point
in
my
writing
experience
at
college
because
of
the
way
that
the
events
at
that
time
played
out.
I
got
the
stomach
flu
the
weekend
that
exams
were
starting.
I
had
two
exams
back
to
back
on
Monday
and
my
history
final
was
due
by
6PM
on
Tuesday.
I
was
essentially
passed
out
on
my
bed
for
the
whole
weekend
and
had
to
cram
for
my
psychology
and
Russian
finals.
After
taking
two
exams
back
to
back
I
had
to
head
back
to
my
dorm
to
begin
answering
four
comprehensive
essay
questions.
I
did
the
majority
of
the
first
one
as
well
as
quickly
outlined
the
rest
in
a
three
hour
chunk
before
being
too
exhausted
to
continue.
I
then
woke
up
the
next
morning
and
worked
straight
through
the
day,
save
for
two
short
breaks
for
lunch
and
dinner.
It
was
the
closest
thing
to
an
all
night-er
that
I
have
ever
pulled.
I
also
was
very
unhappy
because
I
felt
like
the
whole
thing
was
rushed
and
shoddily
thrown
together.
In
the
end
I
got
an
okay
grade,
but
it
definitely
was
not
my
best
work.
If
anything,
it
just
served
as
an
eye
opener
as
to
why
it
is
good
to
take
time
to
plan
out,
write,
and
revise
essays.
I
guess
it
could
be
called
a
formative
writing
experience
from
that
standpoint.
My
second
semester
as
a
writer
was
much
tamer.
I
once
again
had
a
history
class
that
required
the
nightly
journals
as
the
only
form
of
written
assignment
besides
coming
in
and
taking
exams.
After
a
semester
of
doing
two
journals
a
night
it
was
simple
to
cut
back
to
only
one.
Additionally,
I
took
a
politics
class
that
involved
a
great
deal
of
writing
within
a
special
context.
I
had
to
create
a
fake
wikipedia
page
on
moodle
about
a
former
post-Soviet
country.
I
was
given
broad
themes
such
as
historical
development
or
democratization.
Then,
I
had
to
research
and
write
mini
articles
about
those
topics.
The
assignment
also
incorporated
peer
editing.
Students
broke
into
pairs
and
peer
edited
each
otherOs
articles
two
times
during
the
semester.
It
was
a
quasi
WA
assignment
for
the
whole
semester.
The
only
difference
was
that
in
addition
to
checking
for
issues
such
as
organization
and
clarity,
we
also
had
to
act
as
fact
checkers.
The
same
partner
evaluation
system
was
also
used
for
the
final
term
paper
that
we
had
to
write
for
the
class.
Being
a
WA
definitely
came
in
handy
with
this
assignment
because
I
felt
like
I
was
more
able
to
help
my
partner.
It
is
easy
to
read
for
typos,
but
it
is
much
harder
to
think
of
questions
that
can
help
a
writer
refine
her
piece.
My
other
writing
experience
second
semester
was
taking
a
VAST
course.
I
was
fairly
lucky
with
this
course.
It
was
taught
by
a
history
professor
and
was
essentially
a
history
course.
I
feel
as
though
we
mentioned
technology
and
science
a
grand
total
of
five
times
throughout
the
whole
semester,
and
most
of
them
occurred
during
the
first
two
weeks.
The
assignment
in
the
class
was
to
write
a
ten-page
research
paper
on
basically
anything
so
long
as
it
had
loose
connections
to
Chicago.
While
my
assignment
may
have
been
loosely
connected
to
history
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
science
at
all,
I
felt
fairly
uneasy
about
the
piece.
My
professor
asked
that
we
write
about
history
in
a
new
fashion.
In
an
attempt
to
enliven
what
can
be
a
very
dry
form
of
writing,
the
professor
told
us
to
write
about
history
with
the
focus
on
the
story.
We
had
to
have
characters
and
plot
developments
within
our
research
essays.
In
theory,
this
seemed
like
it
would
be
an
interesting
and
easy
essay
to
write.
However,
after
writing
mine
I
was
afraid
that
I
relied
too
much
on
my
sources
and
was
really
only
retelling
the
story
instead
of
coming
up
with
a
solid
thesis
and
exploring
it.
I
was
definitely
glad
to
have
a
WA
to
read
over
this
assignment.
Being
a
WA,
I
think
I
was
involved
in
the
conference
in
a
different
manner
than
the
average
student.
While
writing
the
essay
I
kept
feeling
that
there
was
not
enough
material
of
my
own
in
the
essay.
I
also
felt
uncomfortable
with
the
thesis
that
I
had.
I
did
not
think
that
it
was
very
strong.
I
proceeded
to
walk
into
my
conference
and
asked
my
WA
these
questions
about
my
own
essay
that
I
would
normally
ask
my
WA
students.
Thankfully,
I
had
been
overly
critical
of
my
own
work,
which
is
usually
my
reaction
to
my
writing.
After
this
experience,
I
can
say
it
is
definitely
easier
to
be
on
the
student
side
of
the
conference
than
on
the
WA
side.
I
found
this
out
very
quickly
during
my
first
semester
as
a
WA.
My
experience
as
a
WA
during
the
first
semester
was
interesting
to
say
the
least.
I
have
to
admit
that
I
was
pretty
nervous
during
my
first
few
conferences
because
I
was
still
unsure
as
to
how
the
whole
process
really
worked
with
me
trying
to
steer
discussion
about
studentsO
papers.
My
anxiety
was
only
added
to
by
the
fact
that
I
had
to
WA
an
assignment
that
I
considered
to
be
unconventional.
The
students
read
a
short
story
in
the
class
and
their
assignment
was
to
have
a
conversation
with
one
of
the
characters
from
the
story.
Through
this
conversation
the
students
were
to
come
up
with
a
resolution
to
the
short
story.
All
the
students
adequately
accomplished
the
goals
of
the
assignment
and
I
felt
uncomfortable
because
I
was
reduced
to
being
a
grammar
checker
or
commenting
on
personal
stylistic
choices.
The
rest
of
the
assignments
for
the
semester
left
me
in
a
similar
role.
None
of
the
students
had
problems
fulfilling
the
goals
of
the
assignments
and
it
was
hard
to
establish
a
dialogue
with
a
number
of
the
students.
There
was
really
no
overlap
between
my
own
writing
and
what
I
was
doing
with
my
WA
students.
I
also
did
not
really
get
much
out
of
working
with
that
class.
However,
I
definitely
learned
how
to
conduct
a
WA
conference
and
learned
that
different
writers
have
different
approaches
to
writing.
It
was
interesting
to
see
different
stages
of
writing
from
the
various
writers
as
well
as
to
see
how
the
modified
their
writing
after
various
assignments
and
conferences.
The
real
changes
in
my
WAing
and
writing
dynamics
happened
in
the
second
semester.
As
I
have
previously
mentioned,
after
a
semester
of
WAing
papers,
I
became
even
more
critical
of
my
own
writing
and
proceeded
to
ask
the
types
of
questions
that
I
would
ask
in
a
conference
to
myself
about
my
own
papers.
In
the
second
semester,
I
also
found
that
previous
assignments
helped
me
to
have
more
productive
conferences.
For
the
second
semester
I
was
WAing
an
upper
level
writing
course
and
all
of
the
students
were
older
than
I,
except
for
one.
The
first
assignment
for
the
class
was
to
write
a
book
review.
The
students
had
to
read
an
unassigned
book
and
summarize
it.
Then,
they
had
to
use
outside
sources
and
knowledge
from
class
to
analyze
the
quality
of
the
book
and
its
arguments.
This
assignment
was
perfect
for
me
because
I
had
done
a
similar
one
for
my
history
class
the
previous
semester.
I
knew
the
struggle
of
trying
to
balance
the
summary
with
the
analysis.
It
was
also
hard
to
judge
to
what
extent
outside
sources
should
be
incorporated.
Finally,
there
was
the
issue
of
the
tone
and
audience
of
the
paper.
Both
the
students
and
I
were
asked
to
write
for
scholarly
audiences.
Thus,
we
had
to
assume
the
roles
of
scholars,
and
in
turn,
were
asked
to
use
similar
language.
It
was
definitely
easier
to
have
discussions
with
the
students
after
having
written
a
similar
piece
myself.
Although
I
wrote
my
for
a
different
professor
in
a
different
department,
the
basic
ideas
behind
the
two
projects
were
the
same.
Having
already
had
my
assignment
graded,
I
knew
some
of
the
pitfalls
to
avoid.
I
also
had
a
better
idea
about
the
mix
between
the
summary
and
analysis
portions
of
the
papers.
I
felt
confident
about
that
round
of
conferences
and,
in
general,
the
students
seemed
to
take
a
lot
out
of
that
round
as
well.
The
rest
of
the
WA
assignments
for
the
second
semester
went
smoothly.
I
was
able
to
hold
conferences
over
all
stages
of
writing
from
the
barest
of
outlines
to
completed
essays.
Every
conference
felt
meaningful.
Some
students
clearly
did
not
want
to
be
at
the
conferences,
but
they
at
least
put
in
the
effort
to
show
up
as
well
as
to
communicate
with
me.
It
was
a
nice
change
to
have
the
students
ask
questions
about
their
writing.
Also,
some
of
the
students
followed
up
on
my
offer
to
email
me
further
drafts
of
their
essays.
I
said
they
could
email
me
them
up
to
a
certain
point
before
the
due
dates
and
I
would
read
through
them
again.
This
was
exciting
because
in
a
few
cases
I
could
see
the
essays
fully
take
form.
One
student
and
I
had
a
conference
about
her
outline.
A
day
or
two
later
she
sent
me
a
rough
draft
of
her
essay.
She
also
sent
me
a
second
draft
before
the
final
due
date.
It
was
interesting
to
be
involved
in
multiple
stages
of
the
writing
process
and
to
see
the
piece
progress
from
a
rough
sketch
to
a
final
work.
I
can
not
definitely
say
that
my
second
semester
of
WAing
papers
has
changed
my
writing
style
anymore.
As
I
have
mentioned
before,
I
am
extra
critical
of
my
own
writing
now.
However,
I
have
not
changed
my
writing
process
at
all.
As
usual,
I
come
up
with
a
thesis
and
sketch
out
the
barest
outline
on
some
scratch
paper.
From
there,
I
just
write
and
see
where
that
takes
me.
Often
times
I
do
not
revise
my
essays
that
much.
I
will
try
to
fix
the
grammar
or
the
organization
in
a
few
places,
but
usually
what
I
first
write
ends
up
being
very
similar
to
the
finished
product.
The
only
thing
about
being
a
WA
is
that
I
am
even
more
inclined
to
show
my
work
to
friends
or
other
WAs
so
as
to
have
a
second
pair
of
eyes
scan
for
issues.
Being
a
WA,
I
have
seen
first
hand
how
having
someone
else
read
my
work
can
greatly
improve
the
piece.
I
always
miss
typos
or
some
awkward
phrasing
in
my
own
work.
Also,
sometimes
I
am
not
as
clear
on
some
points
as
I
should
be.
Thus,
I
often
ask
another
WA
or
friend
to
quickly
scan
through
my
work.
I
definitely
feel
more
confident
about
my
work
after
I
have
another
pair
of
eyes
look
at
it.
I
will
definitely
keep
this
practice
up
throughout
the
upcoming
academic
year.
I
will
have
two
writing
courses
and
I
am
sure
that
I
will
need
some
help
with
both
of
them.
Ultimately,
I
am
sure
that
I
will
annoy
a
few
WAs
with
my
thirty
page
research
paper
for
my
300
level
history
course.
I
doubt
many,
if
any,
WAs
will
be
interested
in
reading
thirty
pages
about
Russia
during
the
First
World
War.
