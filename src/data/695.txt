My
Journey
as
a
Writer
My
journey
as
a
Spanish
writer
started
early
in
my
life.
I
was
only
four
years
old
when
I
learned
to
write
my
first
words
in
kindergarten.
I
remember
my
teachers
taught
me
how
to
write
three
words:
my
name,
mother
(mam),
and
father
(pap).
I
did
not
really
know
how
I
was
going
to
use
those
symbols
to
read
and
write
later
on,
but
I
was
so
excited
I
knew
how
to
write
that
I
would
write
those
words
over
and
over
again
on
all
the
papers
I
found
whenever
I
had
a
pencil
in
my
hands.
When
I
was
on
first
grade,
I
learned
to
write
my
first
sentences
and
short
paragraphs
in
Spanish.
In
my
school,
all
first
graders
learned
to
write
the
same
first
sentence
at
the
beginning
of
the
year:
NMi
mam
me
mima,O
which
in
English
means
Nmy
mother
pampers
me.O
I
do
not
know
why
that
phrase
is
so
special,
but
whenever
people
talk
about
first
grade,
they
always
mention
that
phrase.
I
think
students
have
to
write
it
so
many
times
and
they
feel
so
proud
when
they
show
they
can
write
an
entire
sentence
on
their
own,
that
they
never
forget
it.
After
around
thirteen
years,
my
family
and
I
still
remember
that
magical
sentence
that
represents
the
first
step
in
my
journey
as
a
writer
in
more
than
one
language.
During
the
next
seven
years
of
my
school
education,
I
primarily
learned
how
to
write
summaries,
lab
reports,
some
poems
and
short
stories.
There
was
a
very
strong
emphasis
in
grammar
and
punctuation
in
all
my
classes.
I
remember
that
if
I
had
three
grammar
mistakes
in
any
of
my
writing
pieces,
I
would
get
a
zero
in
an
assignment,
homework
or
even
in
an
exam
since
sixth
grade.
I
had
to
write
with
pen,
so
it
would
not
look
good
if
I
crossed
any
word
or
sentence.
I
remember
it
was
really
stressful,
but
I
could
make
a
correction
and
get
the
credit
back
most
of
the
time
for
some
assignments.
Even
thought
there
was
a
very
strong
emphasis
in
grammar,
there
was
not
such
a
strong
emphasis
in
reading
or
in
writing
more
complex
or
longer
pieces.
In
the
school
system
in
Bolivia,
children
learn
how
to
write
short
pieces
using
some
complicated
grammar
structures
in
middle
school,
but
they
learn
how
to
write
essays
and
more
complex
writing
structures
during
high
school.
When
I
was
thirteen
years
old,
I
started
learning
English
in
an
after
school
institute.
That
institute
mostly
taught
students
who
wanted
to
get
a
job
or
study
in
the
United
States
or
any
other
English
speaking
country;
so
writing
essays
was
a
serious
topic.
At
the
beginning
of
my
second
year
in
that
institute,
I
had
to
start
writing
essays
in
English
for
homework
and
as
a
part
of
all
of
my
exams.
I
remember
I
absolutely
hated
it
because
writing
essays
would
take
me
a
very
long
time
and
most
of
the
time
I
was
not
familiar
with
the
topics
I
had
to
write
about.
I
wrote
about
a
variety
of
topics
and
I
learned
to
write
different
styles
of
essays
during
the
time
I
spent
in
that
institute.
At
the
same
time,
once
I
got
to
my
first
years
of
high
school,
my
Spanish
classes
started
talking
about
writing
essays
and
longer
pieces.
The
size
of
my
classes
was
very
big.
There
were
around
forty
people
per
classroom,
so
my
writing
pieces
did
not
get
exhaustive
feedback.
I
think
I
got
to
write
maybe
one
or
two
essays
during
my
sophomore
year
before
I
decided
to
go
to
high
school
in
the
United
States
to
finish
my
junior
and
senior
year.
Once
I
got
to
my
new
high
school,
I
realized
how
behind
I
was
in
my
writing.
When
I
got
my
first
writing
assignments
the
very
first
week
of
school,
I
understood
I
did
not
what
I
had
to
do.
I
was
really
confused
not
only
for
the
assignments
but
also
for
the
new
language
and
the
cultural
shock
I
had
that
year.
I
remember
I
started
the
year
reading
poems,
free
writing,
and
writing
analytical
essays
in
my
computer
for
those
readings.
I
had
no
idea
what
the
poems
were
talking
about.
Since
I
was
really
afraid
and
felt
uncomfortable
in
my
class,
I
talked
to
advisor
about
the
class.
She
listened
to
me
and
said
I
should
talk
to
my
teacher
and
maybe
meet
with
her
in
a
regular
basis.
As
my
advisor
told
me,
I
asked
my
teacher,
Ms
Liu,
to
meet
with
me
during
her
office
hours.
During
our
first
meeting
we
talked
about
my
background
writing
in
English
and
she
said
I
should
meet
with
her
or
email
her
whenever
I
had
questions
about
any
assignment
or
reading.
That
was
a
bit
confusing
for
me
because
I
was
coming
from
a
high
school
where
teachers
had
little
time
to
meet
or
talk
to
students
outside
the
classroom.
However,
I
understood
that
in
this
high
school,
classes
were
very
small
and
therefore,
students
got
a
lot
of
attention
from
all
the
teachers
and
staff.
Since
there
were
only
eight
girls
in
my
English
class
and
my
teacher
lived
on
campus,
I
got
to
meet
with
her
very
often.
The
meetings
were
mostly
informal
since
we
became
very
close.
I
would
get
a
lot
of
feedback
and
help
with
all
the
pieces
I
wrote
and
all
the
reading
we
did
during
that
year.
Since
my
English
teacher
was
on
duty
in
my
hall
during
the
weekends,
I
would
spend
all
my
Saturday
afternoons
doing
the
work
for
her
class
or
discussing
pieces
of
readings
she
assigned.
In
addition
to
her
class,
I
also
took
a
class
for
international
students
for
whom
English
was
their
second
language
during
my
first
semester
in
junior
year.
There
were
only
five
girls
in
that
class,
so
I
also
got
a
lot
of
feedback
from
my
teacher
who
happened
to
be
the
international
studentsO
advisor.
I
remember
I
mostly
liked
that
class,
but
I
needed
to
learn
the
material
we
were
covering
in
a
faster
pace
since
I
already
needed
to
write
complex
essays
and
papers
for
my
other
classes.
Summarizing
my
experiences
writing
during
that
year,
I
would
describe
them
as
some
of
the
most
horrifying
ones
I
had
ever
had.
However,
with
the
help
of
both
of
my
English
teachers
I
got
to
catch
up
with
the
writing
level
of
my
peers.
My
improvement
was
so
big
and
notorious
that
at
the
end
of
the
year
I
got
a
price
from
the
English
department.
The
price
I
got,
NKudos,O
was
given
to
one
student
in
every
department
at
the
end
of
the
year.
It
was
given
to
a
girl
who
had
improved
the
most
during
the
year
and
had
put
the
most
effort
to
progress
in
a
class
in
that
department.
I
was
unbelievably
surprised
when
I
heard
my
name
during
a
school
assemble,
but
when
I
think
back
about
that
year,
I
realized
I
had
worked
so
hard
for
my
English
class
and
I
had
put
so
much
time
and
effort
that
it
felt
good
to
know
that
my
teachers
had
noticed
my
work.
At
the
end
of
my
junior
year,
I
realized
that
in
order
to
get
my
graduation
requirements
I
had
to
take
English
classes
both
semesters
of
my
senior
year.
I
was
not
very
happy
with
that
requirement
not
only
because
I
knew
it
was
going
to
be
hard,
but
also
because
my
favorite
English
teacher,
Ms
Liu,
was
not
going
to
be
teaching
at
my
school
the
next
year.
During
my
senior
year,
the
dynamics
of
my
English
class
were
very
different.
My
new
teacher
was
not
that
easy
to
approach;
I
did
not
fully
understand
the
feedback
he
was
giving
me,
but
the
class
was
much
easier.
We
read
a
lot
of
novels
and
more
straight
forward
texts.
We
also
wrote
essays
mostly
in
computers,
but
the
number
I
wrote
was
significantly
less
than
the
previous
year.
When
the
time
to
go
to
college
arrived,
I
did
not
feel
very
confident
with
my
writing
skills.
Nevertheless,
I
knew
that
I
was
prepared
to
write
almost
any
type
of
writing
piece
I
could
be
asked
to.
When
my
FYS
class
started
during
my
first
semester
in
freshmen
year,
I
met
with
my
professor
to
talk
about
the
dynamics
and
expectations
of
the
class
to
be
sure
I
was
prepared
to
do
the
work.
She
was
very
nice
and
helpful.
She
said
I
could
turn
in
my
papers
before
hand
to
get
feedback
before
turning
my
final
drafts
for
the
first
papers.
In
addition,
I
could
talk
to
our
Writing
Associate
or
go
to
meet
with
other
Writing
Associates
to
get
my
grammar
and
spelling
checked.
I
was
really
happy
for
the
opportunity
she
gave
me
so
I
did
what
she
said.
During
our
meetings
to
talk
about
the
feedback
she
had
given
me
in
the
papers,
we
would
discuss
the
topic
for
me
to
discover
new
things
or
expand
the
points
I
had
made
in
my
papers.
Even
though
I
liked
her
feedback,
it
was
a
bit
different
from
what
I
was
expecting
since
I
was
expecting
to
get
feedback
that
mostly
pointed
at
poorly
constructed
sentences
or
misusages
of
words.
During
my
meetings
with
my
WA,
I
got
similar
feedback
to
the
one
my
professor
was
giving
me.
Most
of
the
time,
we
would
talk
about
so
many
points
that
I
would
feel
confused
at
the
end
of
the
meetings.
However,
that
confusion
made
me
feel
that
it
was
up
to
me
to
decide
which
direction
my
papers
were
going
to
take.
Using
what
I
learned
from
my
WA
and
my
professor,
I
wrote
stronger
papers
in
topics
that
were
different
from
the
ones
I
had
written
in
high
school,
because
I
primarily
learned
to
stand
up
for
my
believes
to
write
those
papers.
When
the
second
semester
of
college
arrived,
I
started
taking
my
College
Writing
class.
The
dynamics
of
the
class
were
different
since
the
topics
were
somehow
more
difficult
to
argue
with
since
the
readings
mostly
presented
facts,
researches
or
information
that
was
completely
new
to
me.
In
that
class,
there
was
a
very
strong
emphasis
in
different
types
and
steps
to
write
different
types
of
writing
pieces.
At
the
beginning,
like
in
all
of
the
other
beginnings
I
had,
I
was
a
bit
afraid.
I
also
talked
to
my
professor
and
met
with
him
a
couple
of
times
during
the
semester
to
talk
about
my
papers,
techniques
to
write,
and
ideas
I
had
about
some
of
reading
assignments.
He
showed
me
that
the
way
I
saw
my
writing
was
not
accurate
because
it
was
understandable
and
it
was
not
filled
with
faulty
structures.
He
made
me
understand
that
the
really
important
part
of
my
paper
was
the
content.
It
took
me
a
very
long
time
to
understand
that
the
ideas
I
was
presenting,
and
how
I
was
presenting
and
supporting
them
was
the
soul
of
my
papers.
Even
though
he
said
it
to
me
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
course,
I
only
got
to
believe
it
once
I
wrote
a
paper
that
my
entire
class
got
to
read
and
discuss.
The
paper
I
had
written
for
the
class
was
not
long;
the
structures
and
vocabulary
I
used
were
not
complex,
but
I
did
answer
the
question
the
assignment
was
asking
for.
I
expanded
my
ideas
and
explain
the
points
that
were
important
to
answer
the
question
I
had
been
asked.
I
remember
once
I
found
out
my
paper
was
the
chosen
one
to
be
read
for
the
entire
class
I
could
not
believe
it.
I
even
thought
that
it
was
chosen
because
it
was
poorly
written
and
I
needed
to
get
a
lot
of
feedback
to
improve.
I
was
really
glad
when
my
professor
said
he
liked
it
and
he
had
chosen
it
for
the
opposite
reasons
I
had
thought
about.
After
the
paper
was
posted
online,
my
class
had
to
read
my
paper
and
answer
some
questions
about
it
as
homework.
By
doing
that
assignment
I
learned
to
find
some
of
the
weaknesses
my
writing
has.
I
also
learned
to
look
at
my
paper
from
another
point
of
view
to
be
able
to
criticize
it
and
improve
it.
After
the
class
in
which
my
paper
was
discussed,
I
got
to
feel
more
confident
with
my
writing
even
though
I
will
always
be
hesitant
to
show
the
pieces
I
write
without
getting
some
feedback
in
advance.
My
journey
as
a
writer
has
a
lot
of
up
and
downs.
I
am
well
aware
of
the
fact
I
still
have
to
work
very
hard
to
take
my
writing
to
the
next
level.
However,
I
also
feel
that
my
experiences
have
taught
me
that
hard
work
and
the
ability
to
ask
question
are
the
keys
to
success.
I
feel
that
getting
feedback
in
writing
pieces
made
a
big
difference
in
my
life
and
I
hope
I
will
be
capable
of
making
a
difference
in
some
of
the
students
I
will
be
working
with
this
semester.
