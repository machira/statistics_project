Writing
Like
a
WA
I
thought
this
section
was
really
interesting.
I
never
really
thought
about
it
before
but
I
really
think
it
can
improve
my
writing.
I
paused,
contemplating
whether
these
words
had
actually
come
out
of
my
mouth.
Everyone
around
our
staff
meeting
table
turned
towards
me
in
disbelief,
not
quite
sure
if
they
had
heard
me
correctly.
Professor
Seetch
even
let
out
a
cheer.
Someone
had
actually
learned
something
from
one
of
the
staff
meeting
reading
assignments.
Learning
about
our
own
writing
from
one
of
the
readings
assigned
to
us
for
discussion
in
staff
meetings
was
actually
a
rather
rare
occurrence.
First
of
all,
I
often
read
the
assignments
with
the
goal
of
using
the
information
to
help
other
students,
never
really
believing
that
the
information
could
be
beneficial
to
my
own
writing.
Because
many
of
the
readings
were
about
peer
tutoring
or
techniques
of
teaching
writing,
I
think
my
fellow
WAs
and
I
got
into
the
habit
of
searching
for
tips
for
instructing
others
rather
than
for
tips
for
helping
our
own
writing.
Every
once
in
a
while
however,
the
reading
enlightened
me
to
a
technique
that
I
was
in
fact
able
to
utilize
in
my
further
writing.
These
were
exciting
times
for
us
all.
Though
the
assignments
may
not
have
been
terribly
beneficial,
I
did
learn
many
useful
tips
in
our
staff
meetings.
Most
of
these
tips
dealt
with
dealing
with
the
students
rather
than
actually
writing
ourselves,
but
they
were
useful
still.
Through
my
own
experience
throughout
the
year
and
through
the
discussions
with
my
peers
in
the
weekly
staff
meetings,
I
have
noticed
a
list
of
many
common
concers
of
WAs
as
well
as
many
ideas
and
techniques
that
were
utilized
by
the
majority
of
WAs.
By
discussing
these
ideas
with
each
other
we
were
able
to
brain
storm
solutions
and
perhaps
prevent
the
same
mistakes
from
occurring
in
other
conferences.
In
my
first
year
I
found
the
most
difficult
part
of
being
a
WA
is
letting
the
students
discover
and
correct
their
own
mistakes.
Many
times,
I
was
reading
through
a
paper
and
was
so
tempted
to
cross
out
and
rewrite
words,
sentences,
even
paragraphs
at
a
time.
This
technique,
however,
was
not
only
unethical
but
also
completely
ineffective
in
teaching
the
student
anything.
Pointing
out
the
exact
mistakes
and
explaining
your
own
opinion
as
to
how
to
correct
these
mistakes
may
seem
easier
and
may
even
make
the
essay
a
better
piece
of
writing.
But
the
student
won't
learn
about
the
mistake
or
learn
to
think
critically
about
his
own
writing.
However,
as
WAs
this
is
our
job.
That
is,
not
only
to
help
improve
the
writing
of
students
but
to
help
the
students
learn
how
to
improve
their
own
writing.
Many
hours
were
spent
in
our
staff
meetings
discussing
how
to
get
students
to
open
up
and
talk
about
their
writing
and
to
participate
actively
in
the
revision
process.
I
learned
many
things
from
the
successes
mistakes
of
my
fellow
WAs
who
were
willing
to
share
their
stories
at
the
weekly
meetings.
Many
other
important
topics
were
discussed
in
staff
meetings
that
taught
me
a
great
deal
about
dealing
with
students
and
that
taught
me
about
writing
in
general.
More
than
I
learned
at
these
staff
meeting
however
was
all
that
I
learned
in
my
conferences.
I
have
heard
many
times
that
you
learn
something
best
by
teaching
someone
else,
but
each
time
I
witness
the
truth
of
this
statement
I
am
amazed
and
pleased.
By
spending
so
much
time
with
students
in
conferences
talking
about
writing
and
the
many
things
they
had
done
right
or
wrong,
I
have
become
a
much-
improved
writer
myself.
Many
times
I
would
read
several
papers
all
on
the
same
topic
and
all
trying
to
say
the
same
thing.
By
comparing
these
papers
either
intentionally
or
subconsciously
I
was
able
to
develop
a
sense
of
what
worked
in
these
papers
and
what
didn't.
Reading
so
many
of
the
similar
essays
I
could
analyze
the
difference
between
an
amazing
piece
of
writing
and
a
mediocre
one.
I
could
later
use
this
distinction
when
writing
and
reviewing
my
own
essays.
Sometimes
I
found
myself
incorporating
a
technique
that
was
successful
in
one
of
the
papers
I
had
read
for
a
WA
conference
into
my
own
paper.
Even
though
I
think
I
have
always
been
a
good
writer,
I
was
able
to
learn
many
things
from
the
students
I
was
supposed
to
advise.
But
I
believe
this
is
an
important
part
of
developing
a
writing
style:
learning
from
and
pulling
from
other
successful
writers.
Additionally,
by
pointing
out
mistakes
or
problems
in
the
papers
of
the
students
I
was
better
able
to
avoid
these
mistakes
in
my
own
writing.
And
by
helping
them
to
resolve
these
problems
or
figure
out
how
to
clear
up
any
confusion
I
learned
some
more
effective
ways
of
expressing
myself
in
my
own
writing.
Many
of
the
students
whose
papers
I
read
had
problems
developing
a
thesis
statement.
I
often
asked
the
student
to
scan
through
the
paper
for
the
main
ideas
he
was
trying
to
express
or
for
the
point
that
he
was
trying
to
prove
in
the
paper.
Often
by
looking
through
the
body
of
the
paper
he
was
able
to
explain
to
me
the
purpose
of
the
writing.
The
next
step
was
to
formulate
his
verbal
summary
into
a
concise
and
thought
provoking
statement.
Many
students
had
difficulty
with
this
and
each
time
I
found
myself
developing
my
own
thesis
for
the
paper
in
my
head.
Obviously
I
would
never
reveal
the
thesis
I
had
come
up
with,
but
even
so,
the
practice
of
making
one
up
was
wonderfully
useful
in
producing
thesis
statements
for
my
own
work.
Talking
about
and
discussing
the
paper
with
the
students
was
very
useful
for
m,
but
I
believe
the
mere
exposure
to
so
much
writing
has
greatly
improved
my
verbal
and
written
communication
as
well.
Though
it
may
seem
like
a
stretch,
I
feel
this
experience
is
similar
to
my
experience
in
Germany
this
summer.
I
have
taken
seven
years
of
German
in
structured
classes.
Through
all
this
instruction,
I
have
consistently
fared
well
in
German
classes,
always
seeming
to
understand
what
we
read
or
talk
about
in
class.
I
have
always
been
frustrated
however,
with
how
little
German
I
could
actually
speak,
had
I
been
having
a
real
conversation.
After
seven
years
of
German
I
could
conjugate
a
million
verbs,
write
an
essay
about
my
career
goals,
or
read
a
poem
by
Goethe.
The
essay
and
the
poem
however,
took
me
tremendous
amounts
of
time
to
complete
and
worse
yet,
I
couldn't
speak
the
language.
Sure,
I
could
answer
questions
posed
in
class,
but
a
decent
conversation
was
impossible.
How
many
classes
would
I
have
to
take
before
I
could
actually
speak
it?
Then
this
summer
I
took
a
trip
to
Germany
where
I
loved
for
six
weeks.
I
spoke
German
at
home,
in
class,
in
the
train
station,
in
the
supermarket
and
in
the
bars
at
night.
Everywhere
I
went
I
was
exposed
to
the
language.
In
a
month
I
was
speaking
almost
fluently.
In
comparison,
I
have
had
many
years
of
formal
English
classes
in
school.
I
have
learned
grammar,
sentence
structure,
and
the
proper
way
to
write
an
introduction.
But
I
still
was
never
happy
with
my
writing.
I
would
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
on
my
essays,
changing
and
rewriting
them
several
times
and
never
being
happy.
I
would
have
to
think
for
long
period
to
figure
out
just
one
sentence.
And
in
the
end
I
was
usually
content
with
the
essay
but
never
completely
happy
about
it.
But
similar
to
my
Germany
experience,
after
a
great
deal
of
exposure
to
college
writing
last
year,
it
became
more
natural
to
me.
Essays
took
a
shorter
time
to
write,
sentences
came
more
quickly,
and
I
felt
like
I
was
almost
more
"fluent"
in
English.
Although
I
have
always
been
an
avid
reader,
the
type
of
writing
I
found
in
most
novels
was
not
the
same
style
that
could
be
used
in
my
scholastic
essays.
So
although
this
certainly
was
important
exposure
to
good
writing,
my
experience
as
a
WA
this
past
year
has
been
even
more
beneficial
in
exposing
me
to
college
writing.
Aside
from
exposing
myself
to
written
expression,
actual
writing
improves
my
skills
as
well.
The
first
semester
of
last
year
I
did
very
little
writing
at
all.
My
WA
positing,
therefore,
was
great
so
that
I
was
still
involved
with
some
type
of
writing.
Not
using
my
work
for
a
long
period
of
time
also
meant
that
I
didn't'
see
the
improvement
in
my
skills
until
I
began
my
VAST
class
in
the
second
semester.
My
essays
in
the
class
were
far
from
perfect
but
it
was
improved
from
my
writing
in
previous
years.
Not
only
did
I
find
my
essays
better
but
I
also
found
that
I
spent
less
time
writing
them.
And
the
more
I
write
the
easier
it
become
and
the
more
improvement
I
found.
Sometimes
I
worry
that
because
my
essays
are
being
written
quicker
that
this
is
an
indication
that
I
am
following
some
type
of
writing
formula.
Or,
like
we
talked
a
lot
about
in
staff
meeting,
that
I
am
writing
for
the
professor.
I
heard
that
maybe
the
writing
process
is
becoming
shorter
because
I
have
become
more
efficient
as
to
fitting
my
writing
into
the
mold
cast
by
the
professor's
wishes.
But
even
as
I
write
this
paper
I
feel
as
thought
I
am
more
competent
and
have
improved
my
writing
and
have
become
more
efficient
in
expressing
myself
in
the
way
that
I
want
to.
I
don't
think
that
I
follow
a
formula
in
my
writing
but
that
I
am
working
on
developing
a
writing
style.
Writing
so
often
has
helped
me
to
develop
this
style
more
and
more.
In
addition,
in
my
VAST
class
I
found
how
much
my
proofreading
skills
have
improved.
By
reviewing
and
thinking
about
others
work,
I
have
learned
to
think
critically
about
me
own.
I
sometimes
find
many
of
the
same
errors
in
my
writing
that
I've
found
in
my
students'.
And
just
as
I've
found
that
reviewing
the
essays
of
my
students
has
become
easier,
I've
also
found
that
I've
become
better
at
reviewing
my
own.
Finally,
another
factor
that
has
drastically
changed
my
writing
over
the
past
year
is
my
philosophy
study.
The
writing
I
do
for
my
philosophy
classes
is
completely
different
than
the
writing
I
do
for
any
oter
classes,
yet
they
teach
me
so
much
that
I
can
apply
to
the
writing
in
other
classes.
Any
superfluous
words
or
statements
in
my
philosophy
essays
are
crossed
out,
any
statement
no
supported
by
an
argument
is
disregarded
and
any
sentence
or
paragraph
that
does
not
follow
logically
from
the
previous
one
is
considered
invalid.
This
type
of
writing
was
extremely
difficult
for
me
to
get
used
to.
Mt
first
paper,
presenting
a
philosophical
argument
contained
an
introduction
like
every
other
paper
I've
ever
written
in
my
life.
When
handed
back,
however,
almost
the
entire
introduction
had
been
crossed
out,
including
the
thesis
statement
that
summarized
the
rest
of
the
paper.
Words
like
"unnecessary"
and
"repetitive"
were
written
in
the
margins
formerly
reserved
for
phrases
like
"good
elaboration"
or
"nice
emphasis."
In
these
philosophy
classes
I
learned
the
importance
of
supporting
each
of
my
statement
with
valid
arguments
instead
of
simply
making
elaborate
statements
with
flowery
words.
Additionally,
the
philosophical
writing
taught
me
even
more
about
organization.
In
a
philosophy
paper,
one
idea
must
flow
logically
from
the
nest
in
order
to
formulate
a
logical,
valid,
and
sound
conclusion.
I've
used
this
strict
organizational
structure
in
many
other
papers
in
which
I
was
trying
to
make
a
point
or
present
an
argument.
So
although
my
writing
has
not
become
flawless
over
the
past
year,
I
have
learned
various
new
techniques
that
have
improved
my
work
dramatically.
My
experiences
as
a
WA
have
increased
my
efficiency
in
revision
and
the
exposure
to
a
large
amount
of
writing
has
taught
me
new
techniques
that
have
proven
to
be
very
effective.
The
tremendous
amount
of
writing
in
my
VAST
class
has
made
me
more
comfortable
with
using
these
new
techniques
and
has
provided
me
with
an
opportunity
to
work
on
and
develop
my
own
writing
style.
And
finally
my
experience
in
philosophical
essays
have
introduced
me
to
a
very
new
type
of
writing
that
may
not
work
in
writing
for
other
classes
but
parts
of
which
can
carry
though
to
be
ver
beneficial
in
other
areas.
Through
all
these
experience
I
have
become
much
more
happy
with
writing..
.not
only
because
I
think
it
is
of
better
quality
but
also
because
essays
don't
take
as
long
to
write
and
revise!
