My
Career
as
a
Writer
While
reflecting
upon
my
"career"
as
a
writer,
I
come
to
realize
many
things
about
not
only
my
writing,
but
also
my
education
and
my
own
changing
interests.
For
the
first
time
I
become
aware
that
I
truly
enjoy
writing
and
have
always
enjoyed
it.
After
reading
and
researching
a
topic,
writing
a
paper
has
become
a
satisfying
conclusion
for
me.
Unlike
many
people,
I
do
not
dread
sitting
down
before
a
computer
and
writing,
I
look
forward
to
it.
It
has
become
a
challenge
for
me.
A
challenge
not
only
because
it
is
creating,
but
also
because
I
came
from
an
educational
system
which
never
stressed
writing.
We
were
taught
only
the
basics,
never
were
we
taught
what
makes
a
successful
writer.
But
despite
this
lack
of
education,
I
have
learned
to
write
effectively.
As
I
look
back
on
my
history
as
a
writer
I
see
how
my
writing
has
developed.
With
every
comment
and
criticism,
I
continue
to
learn
more
about
writing
and
becoming
a
successful
writer.
My
first
recollection
of
any
written
work
was
the
ever
popular
elementary
school
topic
of
summer
vacation.
This
topic
seemed
to
resurface
on
a
yearly
basis,
and
must
have
been
a
good
way
for
teachers
to
learn
about
the
ability
of
each
new
student.
For
me,
this
was
always
a
snap
to
write.
First
I
wrote
of
the
biggest
event
of
the
summer,
the
family
vacation.
A
day
by
day
description
of
events
were
written
out
so
that
not
a
minute
of
what
I
thought
was
pure
heaven
would
be
missed.
Following
this
were
the
other,
more
trivial
events
of
the
summer.
The
weekend
hikes
in
the
forest,
and
the
daily
trips
to
the
events.
I
knew
what
I
liked
best
about
the
summer
and
what
I
did
not.
It
was
always
easy
for
me
to
express
those
three
month
old
memories
as
if
they
had
occurred
just
the
previous
day.
The
other
early
childhood
writing
which
I
so
bitterly
recall
were
the
behavioral
essays.
Although
I
was
never
the
cause
of
strife
within
my
classroom,
we
all
were
forced
to
feel
some
punishment
when
strife
arose.
Often
this
punishment
came
in
the
form
of
an
essay.
For
example,
I
remember
writing
numerous
essays
concerning
the
treatment
of
substitute
teachers
or
after
lunch
indoor
recess
behavior.
For
me
these
writing
were
always
far
from
being
difficult.
I
knew
perfectly
well
why
it
was
wrong
to
scream
or
fight
during
indoor
after
lunch
recess,
and
it
was
usually
relatively
easy
for
me
to
put
these
numerous
reasons
into
three
paragraphs,
each
containing
four
to
six
concise
sentences.
However
disaster
struck
in
third
grade
history.
As
part
of
our
studies
of
the
Presidents
of
the
United
States,
we
were
required
to
write
four
pages
about
a
president.
Each
person's
president
would
be
decided
by
drawing
a
name
out
of
a
hat.
Of
course
I
like
every
one
else
wanted
one
of
the
popular
presidents,
perhaps
Lincoln,
Washington,
FDR,
Kennedy,
or
even
Reagan.
To
my
dismay,
I
chose
the
Herbert
Hoover.
We
were
given
three
weeks,
a
virtual
eternity
in
third
grade,
to
write
the
report.
I
immediately
began
my
research.
I
read
every
encyclopedia
entry
about
Hoover,
as
well
as
a
few
small
books.
I
was
not
interested.
So
my
solution
was
to
put
off
writing
the
actual
report,
which
I
did
successfully
until
the
night
before
the
report
was
due.
Luckily
though,
with
the
support
of
my
mother
I
was
able
to
finish
my
four
page
report
without
difficulty.
Hence
began
my
feeling
that
I
work
best
under
pressure.
The
report
turned
out
to
be
magnificent,
a
sentiment
felt
by
both
myself
and
my
teacher.
It
was
clear
and
concise,
chronological,
and
even
had
a
strong
introduction
and
conclusion.
My
only
noticeable
difficulty
with
my
work
was
a
constant
confusion
between
my
lower
case
d's
and
b's.
I
was
thrilled
by
my
work.
With
one
successful
report
under
my
belt,
I
was
hungry
for
another.
With
that
one
report
I
had
fallen
in
love
with
doing
research
and
then
writing
about
what
I
had
read.
Several
more
elementary
school
reports
were
to
follow.
A
report
about
Maine,
in
which
I
gave
the
history,
commerce,
and
topography
of
the
state.
I
also
had
to
write
about
the
my
home
state
of
Pennsylvania.
This
report
was
probably
one
of
the
most
challenging.
It
was
not
the
typical
relaying
of
facts
kind
of
report.
We
were
to
be
ingenious.
This
is
where
my
problems
once
again
began.
I
loved
researching
and
writing
about
subjects
in
a
fashion
that
was
effective,
but
not
necessarily
nail-biting.
It
was
the
creative
part
of
the
assignment
that
gave
me
problems.
I
decided
to
give
a
history
of
Pennsylvania
by
means
of
creating
a
narrative
about
a
family
traveling
to
various
historical
Pennsylvania
landmarks,
as
well
as
other
points
of
interest.
The
idea
was
wonderful,
it
was
the
execution
that
created
problems.
No
matter
how
I
tried
to
make
the
Pennsylvania
report
sound
like
a
story,
it
kept
failing.
It
was
difficult
for
me
to
write
creatively,
and
my
creativity
grade
reflected
it.
Although
I
received
an
"E"
(excellent)
for
the
content
of
the
report.
It
was
not
creative
or
interesting
enough.
I
had
a
good
idea,
but
I
was
unable
to
develop
it
fully.
I
seemed
to
be
ineffective
at
holding
the
reader's
attention.
Thus
began
my
difficulty
with
creative
writing.
It
would
be
years
of
torment
for
me
while
I
toiled
through
what
seemed
to
be
hundreds
of
creative
writing
assignments.
Although
my
writing
skills
were
fine
for
research
papers,
they
did
not
seem
adequate
for
creative
writing.
Short
story
after
short
story
I
received
just
an
average
grade.
I
always
had
difficulty
developing
characters
and
plots.
Nothing
was
even
remotely
interesting.
In
fifth
grade,
we
were
asked
to
write
a
science
fiction
story.
It
was
disastrous
from
the
first
moment.
I
can
no
longer
even
remember
the
plot,
all
I
remember
is
that
it
was
six
pages
of
me
recounting
to
the
reader
which
star
the
space
ship
was
passing,
and
the
Martians
that
existed
on
that
star
or
planet.
Then
came
writing
poetry.
It
was
another
class
requirement
which
I
abhorred.
I
remember
every
poetry
session
began
with
hiku,
which
was
probably
my
best
form
of
poetry.
In
elementary
school
and
junior
high,
it
was
more
finding
words
that
worked
with
the
syllable
count
than
the
actual
effectiveness
of
the
entire
poem.
It
was
the
other
poetry,
the
more
complex
personalized
poetry
that
I
could
not
effectively
master.
I
read
poetry
and
appreciated
it,
but
I
was
not
able
to
create
such
works.
Everything
sounded
forced
and
full
of
cliches.
My
teachers
felt
the
same
way.
I
suppose
I
had
always
felt
that
writing
stories
and
poetry
were
talents
that
one
possessed
and
was
able
to
develop
much
like
painting,
or
one
is
simply
born
without
such
impulses,
making
creative
work
such
as
poetry
very
difficult
and
awkward.
My
high
school
years,
while
still
plagued
with
creative
writing
assignments,
involved
little
other
writing.
Possibly
it
was
because
my
high
school
had
but
one
history
teacher
per
grade
and
two
English
teachers
per
grade,
and
they
were
not
interested
in
reading
230
papers,
or
possibly
they
felt
that
being
able
to
write
effectively
was
of
little
importance.
Whatever
the
case
though,
my
high
school
writing
was
limited.
In
ninth
grade
we
were
required
to
write
a
few
four
page
book
reports.
We
were
given
an
outline
for
writing
the
book
reports.
The
outline
allowed
us
to
fill
in
the
blanks,
the
characters,
the
plot,
effectiveness,
etc....
I
had
little
trouble
with
these
reports.
All
I
needed
were
the
facts,
and
all
the
teacher
cared
about
was
knowing
that
we
had
actually
read
the
assigned
book.
The
remainder
of
my
high
school
career
was
marked
by
one
major
paper.
This
paper
was
assigned
in
tenth
grade.
It
was
to
be
a
research
paper
on
a
current
topic
of
our
choice.
I
chose
the
depletion
of
the
rain
forest.
I
researched
the
current
status
of
the
rainforest
as
well
as
the
importance
of
the
rainforest
to
the
world
environment.
Writing
the
paper
seemed
easy
enough.
I
stated
the
facts,
presented
major
issued,
and
drew
my
own
conclusions,
an
effective
paper
in
my
opinion.
However
my
teacher
felt
otherwise.
She
felt
that
my
sentence
structure
was
ineffective,
too
wordy
at
times.
She
also
felt
that
I
did
not
have
an
effective
conclusion.
In
my
conclusion
I
attempted
to
summarize
my
ideas
and
the
major
issues
which
I
wanted
to
leave
with
the
reader.
She
recommended
a
quote,
stating
that
my
ending
was
not
"dramatic"
enough.
I
disagreed,
feeling
that
a
summary
was
an
effective
way
to
end
the
paper.
Unfortunately
that
marked
the
end
of
my
high
school
writing
career
except
for
a
few
incidental
two
page
papers.
So
naturally
I
felt
quite
ill
equipped
upon
my
entrance
into
Lafayette
College
three
years
ago.
My
first
Lafayette
writing
experience
was
in
my
First
Year
Writing
class.
The
class
assignment
was
to
write
about
a
cemetery
in
the
Easton
area.
We
were
required
to
include
in
the
paper
our
perceptions
of
the
cemetery
and
the
ways
in
which
the
cemetery
aided
in
the
healing
of
the
pain
of
the
family
and
friends.
With
great
trepidation
I
wrote
the
paper.
Fearing
the
worst,
I
submitted
two
copies
of
the
paper
to
my
professor.
One
week
later
I
met
with
my
WA.
Her
biggest
complaint
was
that
I
had
many
good
ideas,
I
simply
never
fully
developed
them.
Bearing
this
in
mind,
I
returned
home.
Adding
here
and
subtracting
there,
I
modified
my
paper
for
final
submission.
In
the
end,
I
did
receive
a
decent
grade.
However
I
realized
that
much
more
was
expected
of
me.
I
realized
that
although
my
ideas
seemed
clear
to
me
on
paper,
they
were
often
still
not
clear
to
others.
I
needed
to
be
more
thorough,
and
so
I
was.
My
next
class
assignment
was
to
write
about
an
artwork,
song
or
story
which
conveyed
death
and
dying
and
how
it
did
so.
I
chose
to
write
about
an
artwork.
This
paper
became
my
first
truly
successful
paper
written
at
Lafayette.
Not
only
did
I
realize
how
much
I
liked
to
write
about
art,
but
I
was
extremely
thorough.
I
did
not
assume
anything
of
the
reader.
I
described
both
the
physicality
of
the
art
work
as
well
as
its
meaning
fully.
I
then
explained
how
death
was
perceived
by
the
viewer
and
the
feelings
it
conjured,
creating
a
paper
which
was
clear
and
understandable
to
any
reader.
Feeling
more
secure,
I
was
able
to
write
with
more
confidence.
I
began
to
enjoy
writing
research
papers
again,
now
incorporating
my
own
ideas
and
interpretations
into
the
papers.
However
just
this
past
year
I
feel
that
my
writing
has
taken
another
turn
for
the
better.
I
spent
a
year
processing
a
manuscript
collection
housed
in
Lafayette
College
Special
Collections.
This
project
culminated
in
the
production
of
a
finding
aid,
a
guide
used
by
researchers
for
the
finding
of
materials
in
a
particular
collection.
Because
the
writing
of
this
guide
demanded
a
very
concise
form
of
writing
,
without
many
extraneous
words,
I
have
since
learned
to
discard
useless
words
leaving
only
the
words
most
essential
to
the
paper's
meaning.
I
have
learned
much
about
writing
over
the
past
15
years.
Although
I
claim
to
be
far
from
an
accomplished
writer,
often
missing
grave
errors
within
my
own
work,
I
do
feel
that
my
writing
has
improved
greatly.
Coming
from
a
high
school
which
placed
little
emphasis
on
effective
writing,
I
feel
that
I
have
overcome
an
obstacle
that
many
students
coming
to
Lafayette
did
not
have
to
encounter.
I
am
now
confident
about
my
writing
style
which
has
proven
effective
for
most
of
my
classes
here
at
Lafayette.
I
hope
that
throughout
my
life
I
will
be
able
to
continue
to
do
the
type
of
research
writing
that
I
have
come
to
enjoy
while
at
college,
and
I
hope
that
each
time
I
write
I
learn
something
new
and
beneficial
about
both
myself
and
my
writing.
