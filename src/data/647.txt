Literacy
Narrative
I
didnut
hate
writing
when
I
was
younger,
per
se,
but
I
certainly
did
not
think
highly
enough
of
the
practice
to
engage
in
it
without
the
mandate
of
authority
figure.
There
are,
I
think,
a
couple
reasons
for
this.
At
the
most
basic
level,
I
was
always
more
visually
inclined
as
a
child.
I
still
am,
to
a
degree.
I
was
always
fascinated
by
shapes,
designs,
and
movement,
and
I
was
thus
much
more
inclined
toward
constructing
pictures
than
paragraphs,
regardless
of
how
inept
I
was
at
drawing.
Additionally,
when
I
was
in
elementary
school,
I
was
certain
I
would
be
a
scientist.
What
that
entailed
I
did
not
exactly
know,
but
I
was
sure
of
two
things.
One,
scientists
worked
with
their
hands,
so
they
rarely
wrote.
And
two,
I
really
enjoyed
picking
my
motherus
flowers,
combining
them
with
pepper
and
water,
and
stuffing
the
mixture
in
the
freezer.
At
the
time,
that
seemed
scientific
enough
to
warrant
my
aspirations.
But
perhaps
the
most
legitimate
reason
I
never
cared
for
writing
when
I
was
young
was
that
I
was
so
bad
at
it.
My
elementary
school
rarely,
if
ever,
used
word
processing,
so
I
was
forced
to
endure
years
of
agonizing
handwriting
classes,
during
which
I
was
consistently
browbeaten
for
my
impatience
and
sloppiness.
But
I
couldnut
help
it.
I
like
to
think
I
was
a
fairly
thoughtful
and
creative
child,
but
writing
longhand
seemed
to
take
long
enough
that
my
ideas
lost
their
flare
by
the
time
I
got
them
down.
Trying
to
fix
that
by
writing
quicker
resulted
in
messier
writing
and,
thus,
more
browbeating.
To
boot,
through
all
of
elementary
school
and
most
of
middle
and
high
school,
I
had
little
to
no
freedom
concerning
the
topics
about
which
I
had
to
write,
and
while
I
occasionally
enjoyed
assigned
prompts,
I
didnut
like
the
loss
of
control.
Thus,
writing
was
known
as
little
more
than
a
necessary
inconvenience.
I
would
pursue
other
creative
interests,
vis-+-vis
freezer
experiments,
and
I
would
only
write
when
required.
Fortunately,
since
my
elementary
and
middle
schools
seldom
utilized
writing-intensive
projects,
I
was
able
to
get
by.
In
the
interest
of
full
disclosure,
I
did
have
a
hugely
unsuccessful
journal,
when
I
was
younger.
Watching
movies
and
TV
shows,
I
would
often
see
kids
writing
down
their
most
precious
thoughts
in
their
private
diaries,
and
it
always
seemed
constructive
because
it
made
evident
and
tangible
the
work
going
on
in
their
heads.
I
felt
guilty
for
not
being
so
constructive,
and
so
I
would
occasionally
force
myself
to
write
down
various
snippets
in
my
Garfield
notebook.
Of
course,
they
were
usually
obligatoryiaalmost
penitentiaand
thus
a
complete
waste
of
time.
So
by
and
large,
I
stuck
to
reading,
daydreaming,
and,
to
the
chagrin
of
my
teachers,
talking.
While
I
was
not
a
writer,
I
always
did,
and
still
do,
read
quite
a
bit.
It
was
something
I
felt
I
should
have
knowledge
of
rather
than
a
hand
in,
but
it
was
usually
entertaining
enough.
However,
because
reading
vacillated
between
pastime
and
academic
obligation,
it
was
always
done
at
a
distance
from
the
material,
and
though
it
could
be
engrossing,
its
impact
was
usually
ephemeral.
All
of
that
changed
when,
in
eighth
grade,
while
I
was
organizing
a
book
drive,
I
found
among
the
boxes
of
books
a
tattered
old
copy
of
One
Flew
Over
the
Cuckoous
Nest.
I
had
never
heard
of
it,
had
never
seen
the
movie,
had
never
even
heard
of
Ken
Kesey,
let
alone
the
Merry
Pranksters.
But
I
was
taken
by
the
bold,
psychedelic
colors
and
rumbling
fonts
on
the
cover.
I
also
liked
the
epitaph:
rione
flew
east,
one
flew
west
/
One
flew
over
the
cuckoous
nest,s
which
was
taken
from
a
Mother
Goose
rhyme
and
thus
made
this
bold
looking
cover
seem
hipper.
So
I
kept
it.
I
squirreled
it
away
on
my
bookshelf,
undoubtedly
in
an
unwitting
and
bizarre
juxtaposition
between
some
classic
like
Great
Expectation
and
my
old
copies
of
The
Bailey
School
Kids.
I
didnut
think
of
it
again
until
summer,
when
I
casually
pulled
it
out
before
bed.
I
got
under
the
covers,
stupidly,
as
if
I
was
reading
some
nighttime
story,
and
skimmed
over
the
first
sentence:
rThey're
out
there.
Black
boys
in
white
suits
up
before
me
to
commit
sex
acts
in
the
hall
and
get
it
mopped
up
before
I
can
catch
them.s
I
then
read
it
again.
And,
carefully
now,
again.
I
was
flabbergasted
by
how
hard
and
blunt
it
felt.
What
was
this
book
about?
Should
I
be
reading
it?
Am
I
allowed
to
be
reading
it?
One
Flew
Over
the
Cuckoous
Nest
felt
over
my
head,
written
for
someone
beyond
me.
I
just
had
to
finish
it.
I
raced
through
the
pages,
burning
into
my
brain
their
incendiary
scenes
and
images:
Chief
Bromdenus
surreal
dreams,
Cheswickus
febrile,
yet
hopeless
tantrums.
It
was
intoxicatingly
unsettling,
as
beautifully
composed
as
it
was
aggressive
and
visceral.
It
was
the
first
book
I
read
that
demanded
to
be
taken
seriously.
I
had,
of
course,
read
classics
before.
They
were,
however,
usually
safe
and
old;
books
I
knew
I
should
respect,
but
only
enjoyed
out
of
politeness.
This
was
the
first
book
I
read
that
felt
at
once
artful,
dangerous,
and
relevant.
I
could
tell
that
Kesey
had
urgently
lodged
his
finger
on
something
deeply
true
about
the
human
condition
and
felt
accomplished
for
just
having
read
the
thing.
During
high
school
the
book
itself
became
personal
artifact
of
my
intellectual
adventurism.
I
havenut
opened
it
in
years,
but
thatus
fine;
the
experience
of
reading
it
was
never
about
repeatability
but
about
understanding
firsthand
that
such
an
experience
is
possible.
In
that
respect,
One
Flew
Over
the
Cuckoous
Nest
changed
the
way
I
read
because
it
taught
me
the
purpose
of
writing
as
art.
Which
is,
namely,
not
to
be
polite,
but
to
be
insightful
and,
in
some
way,
unsettling.
Without
my
introduction
to
One
Flew
Over
the
Cuckoous
Nest,
I
would
not
have
the
following
story.
A
story
that
is
both
slight
and
monumental.
A
story
of
the
long-time-coming
first
paper
I
truly
enjoyed
writing,
top
to
bottom.
As
part
of
the
summer
work
Iud
been
assigned
for
AP
English
Lit,
a
class
I
took
for
the
prestige
as
much
as
I
did
because
of
the
great
things
I
had
heard
about
the
teacher,
I
had
to
write
about
a
book
that
changed
my
life.
The
answer
was,
as
anyone
could
guess,
One
Flew
Over
the
Cuckoous
Nest.
Because
I
was
so
passionate
about
the
book,
I
was
passionate
about
the
topic
and
proud
of
the
result.
Itus
somewhat
anticlimactic,
but
it
was,
in
fact,
the
germination
of
my
love
for
writing.
Once
I
realized
how
much
pleasure
I
could
take
in
writing,
the
practice
became
easier
and
more
rewarding.
Fortunately,
throughout
the
year
I
ended
up
reading
more
books
about
which
I
became
as
passionate
as
I
was
for
One
Flew
Over
the
Cuckoous
Nest,
and
writing
more
structured
critical
papers
about
them,
all
of
which
made
me
more
interested
in
the
nuances
of
writing
as
both
art
and
communication.
That
English
class,
with
its
volumes
of
handouts,
endless
practice
essays,
and
taxing
reading
list,
is
the
reason
I
decided
to
major
in
English.
In
a
very
real
way,
everything
I
have
done
in
the
past
few
years
can
be
traced
back
to
reading,
and
subsequently
writing
about,
that
one
book.
By
the
time
I
got
to
college
I
had
developed
a
fairly
good
understanding
of
the
purposes
and
powers
of
writing,
but
that
understanding
was
broad
and
unfocused.
The
heart
was
there,
but
not
quite
the
sophistication.
Thus,
what
my
classes
at
Lafayette
and
abroad
would
end
up
teaching
me
was
the
depths
to
which
those
ideas
of
purpose
and
power
can,
and
ought
to,
be
plumbed.
The
single
most
intense
experience
of
that
endeavor
was
reading
Jamaica
Kincaidus
rGirls
for
a
class
on
contemporary
fiction.
Because
of
its
short
length
and
deceivingly
simple
structure,
I
arrogantly
believed
I
had
figured
out
the
story
before
coming
into
class.
It
was
about
memory,
right?
And
the
fragmented,
yet
cohesive
way
the
past
affects
us.
In
fact,
we
spent
three
entire
class
periods
dissecting
that
story,
totaling
to
4.5
hours.
We
poured
over
every
word,
analyzing
their
connotations
and
implications.
The
professor
never
ran
out
of
steam,
and
dragging
us
along
with
him
was
a
kind
of
heuristic
revelation.
Magical,
almost.
Postcolonialism,
femininity,
religion,
motherhood;
all
types
of
ideas
began
to
emanate
from
the
short
piece,
and
as
they
did,
I
began
to
distance
myself
from
my
simplistic
initial
reading
and
the
lazy
method
of
analysis
that
led
me
to
it.
To
this
day,
I
consider
reading
rGirls
the
single
most
important
experience
in
my
literary
growth..
It
taught
me
the
power
that
a
single
word
wields,
and
made
me
realize
how
every
line,
every
sentence
in
a
work
can
be
broken
down
to
reveal
a
more
complete
understanding.
At
the
risk
of
hyperbole,
I
never
read
anything
the
same
way
after
those
class
periods.
I
paid
better
attention
to
diction,
syntax,
intertexts,
tone,
everything.
Literature
may
be,
as
some
argue,
a
macroscopic
art,
most
importantly
understood
in
broad
expressions
and
visceral
reactions,
but
I
believe
that
those
broad
notions
are
created
by,
and
thus
only
fully
understood
through
the
careful
analysis
of,
the
most
basic
formal
and
ideological
elements.
Watching
my
professor
dissect
rGirls
gave
me
new
insights
not
only
into
fiction,
but
to
my
critical
writing,
as
well.
Each
word
should
serve
a
purpose;
if
one
doesnut,
it
is
an
obfuscation
and
should
be
removed.
rGirls
taught
me
that
writing
and
reading
effectively
was
no
simpler,
and
no
more
complicated,
than
that
idea.
While
these
and
other
experiences
have
helped
develop
my
writing
abilities,
with
the
exception
of
One
Flew
Over
the
Cuckoous
Nest,
they
never
lent
to
me
a
serious
sense
of
accomplishment.
While
they
helped
me
develop
my
writing
abilities,
the
fact
that
I
only
effectively
employed
them
when
I
was
assigned
a
specific
topic
about
which
to
write
always
made
it
feel
as
if
a
chunk
of
the
work
had
already
been
done
for
me,
no
matter
how
creative
I
attempted
to
be
within
a
paperus
defined
parameters.
It
is
because
of
that
persistent
sense
of
guilt
that
my
semester
spent
at
University
College
London
became
so
important.
The
educational
and
evaluative
structures
of
classes
at
UCL
vary
by
department,
but
the
common
thread
that
ran
through
all
my
classes
was
the
format
of
the
papers
I
had
to
write.
They
could
be
about
absolutely
anything,
as
long
as
they
fit
into
the
time
period
(if
applicable)
and
class
subject,
which
was
itself
usually
fluid.
For
example,
I
could
write
about
anything
I
wanted
for
The
Modern
Period
II,
as
long
as
the
text
had
been
created
after
1945
and
could
in
some
way
be
tied
to
the
tenets
of
Modernism.
In
addition,
these
papers
would
also
be
read
by
someone
other
than
my
instructor,
and
the
British
emphasis
on
self-learning
meant
that
I
would
not
be
able
to
seek
much
help
on
my
papers
from
anyone.
These
factors
had
a
few
consequences.
First,
since
I
had
unparalleled
freedom,
I
decided
I
would
write
about
anything
that
sounded
interesting
to
me,
no
matter
how
far-reaching.
I
wrote
papers
on
Mad
Men,
Robert
Christgau,
and
Russellus
aesthetics,
all
of
with
have
little
to
no
critical
body
to
call
their
own.
That
meant
that
I
had
to
do
all
the
work,
from
the
ground
up.
The
topic
would
have
to
be
thoroughly
researched
and
competently
argued,
and
there
would
be
no
one
to
tell
me
how
well
I
accomplished
either
of
those
tasks
until
there
was
already
a
number
on
my
paper,
so
I
had
better
do
it
right
the
first
time.
It
was
under
this
pressure
that
I
ended
up
writing
some
of
the
best
papers
Iud
ever
written
in
college.
I
think
I
enjoyed
them
so
much
because,
regardless
of
the
frustration
they
occasionally
caused,
because
they
were
completely
my
own,
free
of
derivation
from
other,
already-accepted
critical
work.
And
because
I
ended
up
overcoming
this
challenge,
I
developed
a
newfound
confidence
in
my
writing.
After
my
semester
at
UCL,
I
know
that
I
have
the
ability
to
figure
out
topics
of
interest
without
the
template
of
a
professor
or
class,
and
that
I
have
the
ability
to
effectively
write
and
research
them.
This
comes
as
a
significant
relief
to
someone
who
intends
on
writing
for
a
living.
And
yet,
despite
my
future
career
goals,
most
of
this
narrative
has
been
largely
private
in
nature.
While
many
young
writers
are
eager
to
show
others
their
work,
I
have
always
been
more
guarded
and
seldom
show
a
piece
to
someone
who
has
not
assigned
it
or
been
judiciously
approved
to
edit
it.
In
fact,
since
I
learned
how
to
type
on
my
own,
even
my
parents
have
remained
largely
ignorant
of
the
writing
Iuve
done.
Though
I
doubt
there
is
any
single
instance
at
the
root
of
this
reality,
Ium
sure
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
I
have
always
taken
any
academic
task
involving
critical
thinking
personally,
and
since
paper
writing
is
usually
all
critical
thinking,
getting
criticism
on
it
often
feels
itself
personal.
This
goes
for
creative
writing,
too,
as
I
see
it
as
the
most
personal
form
of
writing,
and
thus
that
which
has
the
most
at
stake
when
being
edited.
This
aversion
to
writing
failures
is
so
strong
that
it
has
largely
caused
my
abandonment
of
fiction
and
poetry,
though
I
still
experiment
with
creative
nonfiction.
Of
course,
this
is
a
somewhat
childish
anxiety,
and
because
of
that
I
am
making
conscious
efforts
to
shake
it.
Since
writing
for
The
Lafayette
and
interning
at
a
weekly
in
Philadelphia,
where
I
am
forced
to
write
for
a
larger
audience
and
to
submit
to
pen-wielding
editors,
I
have
certainly
made
progress.
Therein
lies
the
most
recent
entry
in
my
ongoing
literacy
narrative:
my
peace
with
the
peer-review.
But
please,
donut
ask
me
to
read
that
poem
cycle
I
wrote
freshman
year.
