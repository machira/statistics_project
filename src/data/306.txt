My
Literary
Narrative
The
first
writing
assignment
that
I
recall
was
required
of
me
in
sixth
grade,
roughly
the
time
period
when
I
realized
the
importance
of
the
foreign
language
they
call
English.
I
was,
after
all,
studying
English
as
a
second
language.
Living
in
a
society
that
marveled
eloquence
in
English
and
looked
up
to
Western
education
with
almost
a
religious
reverence,
my
parents
had
set
out
to
provide
me
the
best
education
in
town.
Hence
I
was
showered
with
books,
English
books
in
a
primarily
Hindi-speaking
society,
as
early
on
as
second
grade.
I
took
to
those
books
like
bees
to
honey,
maybe
even
more
passionately.
My
varied
and
frequent
readings
subconsciously
gave
me
a
'feel'
for
the
language
-something
that
no
grammar
class
of
mine
ever
accomplished
-
besides
augmenting
my
vocabulary,
and
instilling
in
me
a
love
for
English
that
overpowered
the
same
for
my
native
tongue.
It
was
about
in
sixth
grade
that
I
actually
realized
the
importance
of
English
for
my
academic
success.
Furthermore,
having
learnt
in
my
general
knowledge
class
what
Sir
Francis
Bacon
once
said
about
writing,
("Reading
makes
a
full
man,
conference
a
ready
man,
and
writing
an
exact
man.
"),
I
started
paying
extra
attention
to
my
writing.
"What
if
I
were
a
millionaire?"
is
the
sixth
grade
assignment
that
was
the
subject
of
my
extreme
meticulousness.
Probably
that's
why
it
is
clearly
etched
in
my
memory,
and
that
too
mainly
as
an
effort
aimed
to
impress
the
instructor
with
my
newly
acquired
language
skills
and
passion.
Two
pages
it
had
to
be,
neatly
written
in
my
composition
notebook.
Since
there
were
no
such
things
as
computers
then,
I
sat
down
with
a
sheaf
of
paper,
pencil
poised
in
hand,
and
let
the
creative
juices
flow.
Following
instructions,
I
first
brainstormed
for
ideas
and
then
divided
them
into
three
parts,
videlicet
introduction,
main
body,
and
conclusion.
Slowly
I
put
together
the
essay,
replacing
ordinary
sounding
words
with
big
ones
that
I
barely
knew,
oblivious
to
the
concept
of
bombast.
Five
or
so
drafts
later,
I
read
the
essay
several
times
making
sure
that
it
sounded
right;
that
it
felt
correct.
Finally
satisfied,
I
neatly
copied
the
essay
in
my
notebook.
I
had
put
in
a
lot
of
time,
and
anxiously
waited
for
the
teacher's
comments.
I
was
exalted
for
the
work
and
provided
the
opportunity
to
read
it
out
aloud
to
the
whole
class,
earning
me
everyone's
awe.
It
felt
exhilarating;
my
ego
was
sufficiently
massaged
and
satiated.
This
exercise
served
well
to
encourage
me
even
further
on
my
quest
for
language
proficiency.
But
my
teacher,
may
I
now
call
her
naive
(probably
as
naive
as
I
was
then),
did
not
see
through
the
thin
fa?ade
of
verbosity
that
I
had
created.
I
had
forgotten
the
fundamental
objective
of
writing
-
to
express
oneself
on
paper
through
the
medium
of
words.
Getting
too
wrapped
up
in
using
good
words,
'good'
meaning
big
and
uncommon,
I
muddled
the
significance
and
impact
of
the
ideas
I
was
trying
to
communicate.
I
realized
my
bombast
much
later,
three
years
later
to
be
exact,
when
I
got
a
new
teacher
in
high
school.
The
first
piece
I
wrote
in
high
school,
the
subject
of
which
I
do
not
remember,
was
shredded
to
pieces
and
virtually
thrown
in
the
trashcan.
I
was
accused
of
trying
to
impress,
which
is
exactly
what
I
had
tried
to
do,
rather
than
making
clear
and
comprehensible
the
points
I
was
putting
forth.
My
grammar
was
good,
but
often
I
used
wrong
diction,
and
wordiness
drew
attention
away
from
the
main
ideas
making
organization
seem
poor.
There
were
more
criticisms
that
I
do
not
recall.
I
guess
I
was
reeling
from
the
slap
I
got
right
across
my
cheeks,
registering
well
only
the
first
few
comments
before
entering
a
puzzled
and
passive
state
of
mind.
This
is
when
I
was
introduced
to
the
concept
of
thinking
critically
about
writing.
It
was
difficult
to
grasp
and
practice,
but
I
made
gradual
improvement.
I
started
feeling
good
about
writing
again.
My
English
proficiency
being
among
the
best
in
school,
I
was
selected
to
the
editorial
board
of
the
school's
annual
magazine,
Endeavour.
It
was
an
exciting
opportunity,
and
I
was
fully
committed
to
it.
In
the
course
of
half
a
year,
I
wrote
several
feature
articles
and
some
rhymes
as
well.
Keeping
in
line
with
the
general
style
of
Endeavour,
I
happily
butchered
formal
grammar
and
included
colloquial
expressions
to
make
the
reading
unconventionally
delectable.
In
all
the
articles,
I
incorporated
the
then
chic
Hinglish,
a
so-called
blend
of
Hindi
and
English
in
which
a
few
Hindi
words
are
strewn
in
the
primarily
English
writing
as
a
way
of
adding
some
pizzazz.
Writing
for
Endeavour
was
exciting
as
it
was
a
new
form
in
which
much
room
was
open
for
creativity.
Furthermore,
being
on
the
editorial
board,
I
helped
in
deciding
the
layout,
contents
and
illustrations
for
the
magazine.
I
also
had
to
select
and
edit
writing
pieces
submitted
by
the
student
populace.
During
the
editing
process,
it
dawned
upon
me
that
I
had
a
better
grasp
of
English
than
most
other
students
in
the
school
as
a
glance
at
some
of
the
articles
made
clear
that
any
attempt
to
correct
them
would
entail
rewriting
them
completely.
Endeavour
was
finally
published
and
circulated.
It
was
widely
appreciated
and
we
were
shown
some
letters
commending
our
effort
sent
by
rival
schools
and
academicians.
I
basked
in
the
praise,
which,
although
not
strictly
for
formal
writing
but
more
for
creative
expression
in
general,
was
greatly
welcome.
I
made
further
attempts
at
similar
writing,
getting
one
article
published
in
the
high
school
section
of
an
English
national
newspaper
of
India.
That
brought
me
a
few
letters
from
old
acquaintances
and
took
me
by
complete
surprise.
An
old
classmate
who
had
transferred
to
another
school
in
sixth
grade,
and
another
girl
I
had
met
in
a
camp
long
ago
wrote.
There
were
a
few
more
letters
from
people
whom
I
barely
remembered,
all
writing
to
renew
contact
and
share
distant
mutual
memories.
I
was
excited
with
the
power
of
national
media
and
felt
important
in
being
a
part
of
it
in
high
school
itself.
In
line
with
the
realization
of
my
relative
writing
skills,
in
tenth
grade
I
was
selected
to
represent
the
school
in
an
all-India
Jesuit
essay
contest.
I
remember
writing
on
'A
journey
of
1000
miles
begins
with
a
single
step,"
which
was
a
surprise,
in
3
hours
was
extremely
challenging.
I
had
tried
to
be
systematic
and
structure
the
essay
well
before
starting
to
actually
write
it.
At
the
end
of
it,
I
was
not
pleased
with
myself
at
all.
The
essay
had
not
turned
out
the
way
I
would
have
liked
it
to
be.
Anyway,
I
fared
better
than
I
expected,
though
not
as
well
as
I
wished
to.
I
stood
22nd
in
the
eastern
region.
Although
I
received
congratulations,
I
did
not
feel
truly
elated.
But
I
came
to
better
understand
my
writing
abilities
compared
to
others.
I
still
had
a
lot
to
learn
and
rehearse.
After
tenth
grade
I
moved
to
a
school
in
Singapore
and
had
to
face
a
new
system
of
education.
I
was
to
pursue
the
Cambridge
University
GCE
'A'
level
examination
at
the
end
of
my
twelfth
grade.
Having
gradually
overcome
the
culture
shock,
I
was
excited
to
find
that
my
new
English
teacher
was
from
the
UK.
Under
his
instruction,
I
faced
difficulties
with
my
writing
initially.
We
were
supposed
to
write
an
argumentative
paper
of
about
1000
words
on
a
surprise
subject
in
an
hour
and
a
half
for
the
final
examination,
and
we
had
two
years
to
train
for
it.
After
writing
a
sample
essay
of
about
500
words
in
the
first
few
weeks,
my
writing
was
critiqued
at
length
on
a
one-to-one
basis
by
Mr.
Whitby,
my
first
English
tutor
who
was
a
native
speaker
of
the
language.
He
went
through
stylistic
errors,
some
grammar
errors
that
I
repeatedly
made
and
the
overall
structure
and
strength
of
my
arguments.
I
didn't
know
then
how
to
balance
the
arguments
from
both
the
proposition
and
opposition
perception
of
the
issue.
I
used
emotional
rhetoric
and
some
poetic
prose
with
archaic
expressions
(which
I
imbibed
from
reading
much
Shakespeare
in
the
first
two
years
of
high
school
in
India,
and
the
use
of
which
was
appreciated
at
my
school).
The
argumentative
style
was
new
to
me,
especially
using
modem
Standard
English,
and
I
had
much
to
learn.
But
I
was
told
that
my
writing
was,
overall,
promising.
Mr.
Whitby's
last
comment
egged
me
on
to
better
my
writing,
and
after
the
mid-year
examinations,
I
was
streamed
to
the
English
class
comprising
the
best
students.
Luckily,
the
same
Mr.
Whitby
taught
the
class
as
he
was
the
head
of
the
English
department.
Meanwhile,
I
was
selected
to
the
school
debate
team,
and
the
training
for
the
Singapore
national
high-school
debate
tournament
helped
me
immensely
in
structuring
my
argumentative
paper.
I
got
better
insight
into
setting
up
an
arguable
case
and
logically
refuting
arguments.
My
writing
improved
gradually,
and
to
my
surprise,
and
Mr.
Whitby's
delight,
I
was
one
of
the
three
students
in
a
populace
of
over
800
to
get
an
A
grade
in
English
for
the
preliminary
GCE
'A'
level
examinations
administered
just
a
month
before
the
actual
exam.
I
was
elated.
For
the
first
time
I
felt
supremely
accomplished
with
my
writing.
But
as
fate
would
have
it,
my
extreme
eager
and
maybe
slightly
nervous
state
of
mind
got
me
a
B+
grade
in
the
final
examination
that
was
graded
in
Cambridge
University,
UK.
That
made
me
realize
that
I
can
never,
and
that
I
should
never,
stop
improving
my
writing
skills.
Near
the
end
of
my
high
school,
another
greatly
formative
experience
was
writing
college
application
essays.
Wanting
to
get
into
a
good
school
in
the
US,
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
and
energy
on
my
application
essays.
In
the
process
of
writing
about
myself,
almost
selling
myself,
I
learnt
many
more
rules
and
stylistic
errors.
After
I
rewrote
my
essays
several
times,
Mr.
Whitby
commented
on
them
before
I
produced
the
final
drafts.
He
was
a
source
of
immense
pride
-1
later
learnt
from
a
school
junior,
who
had
gone
to
him
looking
for
some
early
guidelines
for
college
essays,
that
Mr.
Whitby
claimed
my
essays
and
those
of
a
close
friend
of
mine
were
among
the
best
he
had
read
in
his
12-year
career.
I
was
selected
from
a
competitive
global
pool
to
receive
a
huge
financial
assistance
package
from
Lafayette
College,
for
which
I
gave
much
credit
to
my
application
essays.
Preparing
for
college,
I
had
confidence
that
my
writing
was
of
reasonable
standard,
and
that
I
would
still
have
much
to
learn
upon
my
arrival.
Hence
I
delved
into
my
first
college
writing
assignment,
a
long
research
paper
on
Chinese
language,
with
enthusiasm.
It
being
my
first
research
paper,
I
devoted
a
large
amount
of
time
to
it.
Anxious
to
get
someone's
comments,
I
took
the
draft
to
my
writing
associate
who
could
not
find
much
to
say
about
it
except
that
it
was
excellent.
I
guess
she
noticed
the
unconvinced
look
on
my
face,
and
so
we
talked
about
various
aspects
of
the
paper,
for
each
of
which
she
gave
me
reasons
why
it
was
good.
Still,
when
I
submitted
my
final
paper,
I
was
hesitant.
The
verdict
was
an
A
grade.
The
professor
had
taken
time
to
write
in
detail
that
my
paper
had
no
major
stylistic,
grammatical
or
organizational
errors,
although
the
content
could
definitely
be
improved
upon,
and
to
point
out
specific
areas
for
revising
content.
I
was
convinced,
and
assured
that
I
could
make
it
through
college
without
considerably
worrying
about
my
writing.
At
Lafayette,
I
had
to
do
many
other
types
of
writing,
including
laboratory
reports,
technical
projects
and
application
essays
for
positions
like
those
of
a
resident
advisor.
Each
assignment,
I
discovered,
required
a
different
approach
and
style.
Gladly,
I
now
find
that
whatever
the
assignment
is,
be
it
something
new
like
a
personal
narrative,
I
enjoy
writing
it.
It
gives
me
a
certain
kind
of
pleasure,
and
satisfaction,
in
having
expressed
what
I
think
onto
paper
in
words.
It
makes
it
all
the
more
worthwhile
for
me
to
put
effort
and
critical
thought
into
any
writing
assignment
when
even
one
person
would
read
it
and
critically
appreciate
it,
making
each
writing
attempt
a
conquered
milestone.
Furthermore,
my
FYS
professor
managed
to
reinforce
my
years
of
formal
education
and
instill
in
me
permanently
the
belief
that
learning
how
to
write
is
an
incessant,
but
crucial,
process.
After
all,
I
do
want
to
try
to
be
an
exact
man.
