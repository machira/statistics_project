My
Literacy
History
In
the
past,
whenever
I
have
described
my
history
as
a
writer,
my
description
usually
involves
an
explanation
of
how
easy
writing
has
always
been
for
me
and
how
it
has
always
come
to
me
Nnaturally,O
especially
compared
to
other
disciplines
like
mathematics
and
chemistry,
for
example.
To
prepare
myself
to
record
my
writing
history
for
about
the
fifth
time
in
the
past
two
years,
(once
for
my
FYS,
once
for
my
College
Writing,
once
for
my
VAST
and
once
for
a
writing
class)
I
took
a
look
back
at
some
previous
assignments
I
completed
that
asked
me
to
do
the
same.
While
browsing
through
my
past
work
on
my
writing
history,
I
realized
that
I
had
often
used
the
phrase
Nacademic
strengthO
to
describe
my
writing.
I
had
also
used
the
phrase
Nbest
subjectO
to
describe
the
writing
classes
I
have
taken,
especially
while
at
college.
However,
as
I
prepared
to
record
my
history
as
a
writer
yet
again,
I
realized
that
although
what
I
said
in
past
assignments
regarding
writing
was
true,
writing
has
not
actually
been
as
simple
for
me
as
I
have
made
it
seem.
In
fact,
reaching
this
point
in
my
writing
career
has
been
a
long
and
complex
process
that
has
involved
many
steps.
It
has
also
involved
much
rigorous
practice
and
although
I
consider
myself
a
good
writer
today,
in
the
sense
that
I
can
express
myself
clearly
and
passionately,
gaining
the
privilege
to
say
that
has
not
been
easy.
In
fact,
every
step
along
the
way
has
been
a
challenge
in
one
way
or
another,
but
it
is
by
overcoming
these
challenges
that
I
have
reached
this
point
in
my
writing
career.
My
first
attempt
at
writing
occurred
when
I
was
about
two.
To
no
oneOs
surprise,
the
first
thing
I
attempted
to
write
was
the
alphabet.
I
know
this
seems
like
a
strange
place
to
begin
my
history
as
a
writer,
especially
considering
most
people
do
not
consider
writing
the
alphabet
any
sort
of
a
writing
feat.
However,
it
is
an
important
place
for
me
to
begin
because
like
writing
in
general,
my
first
attempt
at
writing
was
not
easy
for
me
and
it
was
only
through
practice
that
I
was
able
to
master
the
twenty
six
letters
and
move
on
to
the
next
step
of
my
writing
career.
According
to
my
mother,
I
failed
miserably
at
many
of
my
first
attempts
at
writing
the
alphabet.
I
could
not
agree
more.
Whenever
I
see
pieces
of
paper
she
saved
with
some
of
my
first
tries
at
writing
the
alphabet,
I
cannot
help
but
laugh
at
how
completely
illegible
it
is.
Nearly
all
of
the
letters
are
either
upside
down,
backwards
or
tipped
to
the
side.
It
is
no
wonder
my
mother
used
to
make
me
sit
at
the
kitchen
table
for
what
seemed
like
hours
rewriting
all
the
letters
until
they
were
finally
decipherable,
or
at
least
until
they
began
to
look
something
like
letters
rather
than
some
jumble
between
hieroglyphics
and
Hebrew.
Looking
back
now,
I
am
thankful
my
mother
forced
me
to
practice
writing
the
alphabet.
It
is
only
because
of
this
practice
that
I
was
able
to
write
letters
successfully
which
eventually
lead
me
to
move
onto
the
next
step
of
my
writing
career.
Much
like
the
fist
step
of
my
history
as
a
writer,
the
next
stepNwriting
words,
sentences,
and
even
paragraphsNdid
not
come
easy
either.
In
the
beginning,
it
was
easy
for
me
and
as
Kindergarten
and
first
grade
rolled
by,
my
writing
seemed
to
be
right
on
track
with
the
rest
of
my
peers.
However,
in
second
grade,
I
suddenly
began
to
fall
behind.
As
my
peers
excelled
at
writing
many
sentences
(in
cursive
even),
I
struggled
to
write
even
one
comprehensible
sentence.
As
my
friends
began
using
periods,
commas
and
contractions,
I
was
still
forgetting
to
capitalize
the
first
letter
of
the
sentence.
Let
me
just
say,
my
future
as
a
writer
was
not
looking
bright.
However,
through
many
conferences
between
my
teacher
and
my
parents,
it
was
determined
that
it
would
be
best
if
I
repeated
second
grade
so
I
could
have
some
more
time
to
practice
both
reading
and
writing.
And
so
that
was
exactly
what
I
did.
I
repeated
second
grade
and
practiced
reading
and
writing.
Today,
I
think
my
parentsO
and
teacherOs
decision
to
keep
me
back
in
second
grade
was
one
of
the
best
things
they
could
have
ever
done
for
me.
Second
grade,
the
second
time,
was
not
only
where
I
gained
a
better
understanding
for
writing
but
this
is
also
where
I
learned
to
read
better,
which
I
think
contributed
to
my
love
of
writing
just
as
much
as
learning
about
writing.
Besides
for
learning
about
writing
mechanics,
like
punctuation
and
parts
of
speechNall
of
which
helped
me
become
a
better
writerN
my
new
understanding
of
reading
also
allowed
me
appreciate
how
the
writing
techniques
I
was
learning
about
were
used.
Suddenly,
it
was
like
each
book
was
filled
with
page
after
page
of
examples
of
how
to
use
commons,
adjectives
and
personal
pronouns.
My
new
understanding
of
reading
also
allowed
me
to
become
exposed
to
several
different
styles
of
writing
that
I
began
to
mimic
in
my
own
writing.
With
my
newfound
understanding
of
both
reading
and
writing,
as
third
grade
approached,
I
began
to
express
an
interest
in
writing
more
so
than
I
had
ever
before.
Usually,
when
I
think
of
my
history
of
a
writer,
this
is
where
I
begin
and
considering
I
enjoyed
writing
from
this
point
on,
my
writing
history
is
for
the
most
part
positive.
However,
as
I
consider
my
history
as
a
writer
now,
I
realize
that
even
though
I
enjoyed
writing,
I
still
had
a
long
way
to
go
to
reach
the
point
I
am
at
today
in
my
writing
career.
Once
I
developed
a
passion
for
writing,
through
my
increased
knowledge
of
both
reading
and
writing,
I
have
to
admit,
writing
did
become
a
lot
easier.
As
with
most
things
in
life,
once
they
become
enjoyable
they
seem
to
become
easy.
This
is
probably
why
I
have
considered
writing
to
come
NnaturallyO
to
me.
However,
just
simply
enjoying
writing
was
not
enough
to
make
me
a
good
writer.
Sure,
I
was
a
decent
writer
for
the
rest
of
elementary
school,
but
once
middle
school
came
around
and
I
began
to
learn
even
more
about
writing,
I
was
once
again
faced
with
a
challenge.
It
was
in
middle
school
that
I
began
to
learn
specific
terms
associated
with
writing,
like
the
different
parts
of
the
paper
such
as
the
introduction,
the
body
and
the
conclusion.
This
was
also
the
time
I
was
introduced
to
what
I
thought
was
one
of
the
most
terrifying
phrases
associated
with
writingNthe
thesis
statement.
Up
until
this
time,
I
had
enjoyed
writing
largely
because
I
was
allowed
to
write
creatively,
in
any
style
I
wished.
Papers
were
not
required
to
have
specific
components
like
the
introductions
and
conclusions.
Besides
for
a
few
quasi-research
papers
I
wrote
in
elementary
school,
there
was
hardly
ever
any
structure
required
in
anything
I
wrote.
Having
the
freedom
to
write
whatever
I
wished
I
think
contributed
to
my
love
of
writing.
I
especially
liked
to
mimic
the
styles
of
the
authors
I
read
back
then,
like
the
humorous
style
of
Roald
Dahl
or
Laura
Ingalls
WilderOs
autobiographical
style.
However,
once
my
teachers
began
demanding
specific
things
in
the
papers
including
theses,
I
began
to
panic
and
my
love
of
writing
became
a
thing
of
the
past.
Suddenly,
much
like
second
grade,
I
found
my
writing
falling
behind
the
rest
of
my
peers.
Rather
than
receiving
As
on
papers,
like
I
had
for
the
past
few
years,
I
was
now
receiving
Bs
and
even
occasional
Cs.
However,
unlike
my
elementary
school
years,
in
middle
school
I
was
able
to
recognize
that
I
was
having
difficulty
with
my
writing
and
I
took
it
upon
myself
(rather
than
leaving
it
up
to
my
parents
and
my
teachers,
like
in
elementary
school)
to
do
something
about
it.
With
my
B
and
C
papers
in
hand,
I
began
approaching
my
teachers
and
questioning
why
I
had
received
these
grades.
According
to
them,
my
papers
lacked
structure,
my
ideas
were
incomplete
and
worst
of
allNmy
thesis
was
not
clearly
stated
(whatever
this
was
supposed
to
mean,
I
had
no
idea
then).
I
specifically
recall
my
eight
grade
English
teacher
telling
me
I
had
great
ideas
but
it
was
like
I
was
Ngetting
distracted
mid-way
through
a
sentence
and
unable
to
complete
a
thought.O
I
was
shocked.
I
could
not
understand
how,
I,
an
A-plus
or
at
very
least
an
A-minus
student,
someone
who
had
been
complimented
on
her
writing
style
in
the
past,
could
actually
be
having
difficulty
capturing
my
ideas
on
paper.
Other
teachers
told
me
my
thesis
was
not
clear.
NYou
need
to
state
your
thesis
early
on
in
the
paper
then
continue
to
support
it
throughout
the
paper,O
they
would
say.
I
completely
disagreed
with
my
teachers.
I
was
determined
to
show
them
that
they
were
wrong
and
I
had
actually
written
very
good
papers.
I
was
going
to
show
them
that
my
ideas
were
complete
and
they
had
just
read
my
paper
incorrectly.
I
was
going
to
point
out
that
my
thesis
was
right
where
it
was
supposed
to
be
and
there
was
structure
to
my
paper.
However,
as
I
went
to
point
out
places
in
my
papers
where
I
thought
I
covered
what
was
being
asked
of
me,
I
realized
that
my
teachers
were
right
after
all.
My
theses
were
often
not
presented
until
three
or
four
paragraphs
into
the
paper
and
even
then,
it
was
not
really
a
thesis
considering
it
was
not
supported
with
many
examples
later
on
in
the
paper.
Some
of
my
ideas
were
not
complete
either.
It
would
state
an
idea
but
before
I
would
support
it
with
examples,
I
would
already
be
discussing
something
else.
As
I
said
what
I
meant
in
the
paper
out
loud
to
my
teachers,
I
realized
I
had
not
actually
written
these
ideas
down
in
the
paper.
NSay
exactly
what
you
are
telling
me
right
now
in
your
paper,O
my
teachers
would
say
as
they
commented
on
the
lack
of
support
in
my
paper.
NThis
idea
is
great,
and
it
is
the
focus
of
your
paper,
it
just
needs
to
be
presented
earlier,O
they
would
add
in
regards
to
my
thesis
statement.
So,
I
went
back
and
revised
the
papers
using
my
teachersO
suggestions.
Not
only
did
adding
these
things
make
my
papers
more
coherent
to
the
reader,
but
rewriting
my
papers
was
also
beneficial
in
that
it
allowed
me
to
practice
the
new
writing
techniques
my
teachers
had
asked
me
to
use.
Although
my
real
motive
for
approaching
my
teachers
and
asking
for
their
help
was
so
I
could
improve
my
grade
on
the
papers
and
ultimately
pull
out
an
A
in
the
class,
looking
back
now,
going
to
my
teachers
for
help
on
my
writing
was
one
of
the
best
things
I
could
have
done
to
improve
my
writing.
Not
only
did
working
one
on
one
with
my
teachers
allow
me
to
get
the
feedback
I
needed
to
help
me
better
my
writing,
but
I
was
also
taking
the
beginning
steps
at
thinking
critically
about
my
writing.
At
this
time,
I
was
developing
many
of
the
critical
thinking
skills
that
go
along
with
writing,
many
of
which
I
continue
to
use
today.
Some
of
these
skills
I
use
today
that
I
started
using
then
include
asking
myself
several
things
including
if
I
explained
things
well
enough
and
used
sufficient
examples,
if
I
have
considered
both
sides
of
the
argument,
and
if
I
have
considered
my
audience
and
how
they
will
benefit
from
what
I
am
writing
about.
By
taking
the
beginning
steps,
in
just
middle
school,
towards
learning
to
think
and
write
critically
as
well
as
learning
about
the
process
of
revision,
I
was
able
to
produce
many
well-written
papers
in
both
high
school
and
later
on
in
college.
However,
middle
school
did
not
prepare
me
for
everything
I
need
to
learn
about
writing.
Throughout
high
school
and
up
to
this
point
in
college,
I
have
continued
to
better
my
writing
mainly
through
working
directly
with
others
on
my
writing
but
also
through
reading.
Throughout
high
school,
I
met
with
teachers
several
times
throughout
the
year
to
discuss
my
writing,
usually
in
the
form
of
analytical
essays
and
research
papers.
I
would
meet
with
them
either
before
I
wrote
something
to
brainstorm
and
make
sure
I
had
a
firm
understanding
of
the
assignment.
Sometimes,
I
would
meet
with
my
teachers
during
the
process
of
writing
to
see
if
I
was
completing
the
assignment
correctly.
Other
times,
even
after
an
assignment
was
returned,
I
would
find
myself,
papers
in
hand
(even
if
they
were
A-papers),
approaching
my
teachers
so
I
could
get
feedback.
I
have
done
the
same
with
professors
at
Lafayette.
Several
times
during
my
college
career,
I
have
approached
professors
for
clarification
on
assignments
and
to
check
to
see
if
I
was
completing
the
assignments
correctly.
This
is
especially
true
in
classes
I
have
been
required
to
write
in
a
style
that
is
new
to
me,
rather
then
the
typical
analytical
essay
or
research
paper
style
I
often
used
in
high
school.
Last
spring,
for
example,
I
found
myself
often
going
to
my
Journalistic
Writing
class
professor
to
get
advice
about
journalistic
writing,
one
style
of
writing
I
had
not
had
much
experience
with
before
attending
Lafayette.
I
have
also
gone
to
several
other
professors
for
advice
on
other
writing
styles
I
did
not
have
previous
knowledge
about,
like
for
the
Writing
Genres:
Communicating
Science
class
I
completed
last
fall.
Besides
for
approaching
professors
for
their
feedback
to
enhance
my
writing,
I
have
also
continued
to
use
one
of
the
skills
I
developed
after
second
grade
(the
second
time)
to
better
my
writingNreading.
Today,
whenever
I
need
to
write
in
a
style
I
am
unfamiliar
with
or
have
not
had
much
practice
with,
I
usually
read
several
different
texts
that
use
this
style
and
then,
basically
copy
the
authors.
For
both
the
Journalistic
Writing
class
as
well
as
the
Communicating
Science
class,
I
have
studied
works
by
others
in
order
to
better
my
own
writing
in
both
of
these
areas.
Besides
for
working
one
on
one
with
professors
at
Lafayette
and
turning
to
reading
to
improve
my
writing,
I
have
also
taken
advantage
of
the
College
Writing
Program
(CWP),
which
has
allowed
me
to
work
directly
with
other
Lafayette
students
to
better
my
writing.
Several
times
while
at
Lafayette,
I
have
taken
advantage
of
the
Writing
Associate
(WA)
drop-in
service,
especially
for
assignments
in
classes
where
I
was
using
a
new
style
of
writing
or
where
I
was
writing
about
an
unfamiliar
topic.
I
have
also
always
been
very
diligent
when
it
comes
to
keeping
appointments
with
WAs
that
have
been
selected
to
work
closely
with
some
of
my
classes.
I
have
found
the
WA
program
is
especially
helpful
because
most
of
the
time,
the
WAs
have
had
some
previous
knowledge
on
the
topics
I
was
having
difficulty
with.
Sometimes,
WAs
have
even
taken
the
same
class
and
could
therefore
advise
me
based
on
his
or
her
personal
experience
with
it.
I
have
always
taken
advantage
of
this
program,
much
like
I
always
approached
my
teachers
for
help
in
high
school
and
continue
to
approach
my
professors
in
college,
because
no
matter
much
my
writing
has
improved
at
this
point
in
my
writing
career,
I
think
there
is
always
something
else
I
can
learn,
especially
by
having
someone
else
take
a
look
at
my
writing.
To
me,
writing
is
a
process
one
can
continuously
improve
upon.
By
allowing
someone
else
to
review
my
writing
and
discuss
it
with
me,
they
are
able
to
communicate
errors
to
me
I
may
not
have
noticed.
It
is
through
this
feedback
that
I
can
improve
and
become
an
even
better
writer
and
succeed
in
the
next
step
of
my
writing
career,
which
will
begin
this
fall.
In
the
next
step
of
my
writing
career,
rather
than
receiving
all
of
the
feedback,
I
will
try
my
hand
at
being
the
one
giving
the
feedback.
This
fall,
I
will
become
a
WA
and
I
will
be
working
closely
with
faculty
as
well
as
students.
I
am
very
excited
for
this
opportunity
and
honored
that
I
have
been
selected
to
be
a
WA.
I
know
this
next
step
in
my
writing
career
will
also
be
challenging,
but
I
am
up
for
the
challenge.
As
much
as
I
am
eager
for
the
about
the
chance
to
work
with
faculty
and
be
involved
directly
with
the
CWP,
I
am
also
excited
about
the
opportunity
to
work
with
students
to
better
their
writing
through
the
same
type
of
feedback
I
have
used
in
the
past
to
improve
my
writing.
Finally,
as
a
WA,
I
am
also
excited
about
becoming
a
better
writer
myself.
I
know
through
my
close
interaction
with
students
in
an
effort
to
enhance
their
writing,
I
will
begin
to
improve
my
writing
as
well.
The
questions
I
will
be
asking
students
about
their
writing,
undoubtedly
will
become
imbedded
in
my
mind,
and
while
completing
my
own
work,
I
know
I
will
constantly
be
asking
myself
these
questions.
I
cannot
wait
to
help
others
improve
their
writing
while
also
taking
the
next
step
in
my
own
writing
career.
