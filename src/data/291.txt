Literacy
Narrative
The
words
were
written
on
a
blue-green
Post-it
note,
next
to
the
phone.
They
were
quotated
and
a
name
was
scrawled
beneath
them.
As
a
child
of
nine,
however,
your
mind
doesn't
always
put
two
and
two
together.
I
live
in
Lewisburg,
PA,
a
small
town,
unremarkable
except
for
a
federal
penitentiary
and
Bucknell
University.
She
had
come
to
my
fourth
grade
classroom
that
morning
to
teach
us
kids
about
the
joys
of
poetry.
At
the
time
she
was
just
a
lady
named
Janet,
but
I
later
learned
she
was
a
professor
at
BU,
and
I
suppose
she
must
have
known
what
she
was
talking
about.
She
talked
about
rhyme
and
meter,
a
barebones
approach
to
creating
poor
man's
reproductions
of
Shel
Silverstein's
work
and
Dr.
Seuss,
which
was
all
the
poetry
any
of
us
had
ever
really
heard
up
until
that
point
in
time.
So
she
spoke
for
a
while,
and
then
had
us
each
write
our
own
poem,
based
on
a
picture
we
chose
out
of
a
magazine.
Pretty
straightforward
pre-teen
poetry
workshop.
I
wrote
mine
about
a
picture
of
a
hypothetical
Martian
expedition
I
found
in
a
copy
of
Popular
Science.
Now,
what
a
copy
of
Popular
Science
was
doing
in
a
fourth
grade
classroom,
I
have
no
way
of
telling,
but
that's
neither
here
nor
there.
We
handed
in
our
compositions,
and
I
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
doing
what
all
kids
do
in
fourth
grade...lunch,
recess,
maybe
some
eraser
clapping
to
see
just
how
big
the
clouds
of
dust
could
get.
By
the
time
3
p.m.
rolled
around,
I'd
completely
forgotten
anything
I
might
have
written
that
morning.
That
changed,
however,
when
I
walked
into
the
house
after
school,
and
opened
the
cupboard
above
the
phone
to
get
a
glass.
Now,
you
see
people
doing
double
takes
in
cartoons
and
stuff
like
that
on
Saturday
mornings,
Channel
6
out
of
Pittsburgh,
but
it's
not
something
that
often
happens
in
the
real
world.
That
was
one
of
the
few
times
in
my
nineteen
years
that
a
double
take
actually
occurred,
I'm
happy
to
say
(because,
really,
everyone
should
have
at
least
two
or
three
under
their
belt).
I
looked
at
the
words
written
there,
read
them,
reached
to
get
a
glass,
stopped,
looked
back,
and
read
them
again.
"The
sky
is
dark,
there
are
no
stars
/
They've
all
been
wished
away."
Needless
to
say,
I
was
confused.
I
had
no
idea
why
the
words
that
I'd
written
that
morning
would
be
next
to
my
phone
at
home
after
school.
The
name
underneath
was
no
help,
merely
reading
"Professor
So-and-So."
It
just
didn't
seem
to
make
sense...at
least
not
conventional
sense.
As
an
avid
reader
of
Marvel
comics,
I
was
seriously
considering
telepathy
as
the
only
possible
answer.
Mom
and
Dad,
of
course,
set
me
straight
later
on
that
evening,
pointing
out
that
telepathy
only
works
in
comic
books
and
Scottsdale,
Arizona.
The
situation
was,
as
it
turned
out,
that
Janet
the
Bucknell
Professor
had
called
my
house
to
rave
to
my
parents
about
my
abilities
as
a
poet,
and
to
encourage
them
to
encourage
me
in
an
encouraging
way
to
keep
writing
poetry.
Pretty
strong
praise,
I
guess,
although
I
can't
ever
remember
my
parents
really
pushing
me
to
write
before
or
after
that
phone
call.
Anyhow,
that
takes
care
of
the
melodrama
(and
telepathy,
for
that
matter).
Hopefully,
they
won't
surface
again
(but
no
guarantees).
Those
words
by
the
phone
are
my
earliest
writing
memory
of
any
substance,
and
one
of
the
few
that
made
a
lasting
impression
on
me.
Whether
for
the
good
or
the
bad,
I've
developed
what
I've
heard
characterized
as
"a
poetic,
lyrical
style,"
and
an
ear
for
natural
cadences
and
rhythms
inherent
in
language.
And
I
think,
in
large
part,
this
has
happened
because
of
the
types
of
things
I
wrote
up
until
the
age
of
around
thirteen,
including
said
Martian
expedition
poem,
and
have
just
recently
re-discovered.
I
guess
it'd
be
fair
to
say
I've
always
had
a
talent
for
writing
skills,
the
tools
needed
to
create
a
good
composition.
I've
scored
perfect
on
just
about
every
standardized
test
they
make
to
assess
verbal
skills,
from
CAT's
to
PSAT's
to
SAT's,
which
probably
stems
from
a
strong
mind
and
a
lot
of
reading
as
a
kid.
Over
the
years,
I've
absorbed
spelling,
grammar,
linguistic
constructions,
punctuation,
and
pretty
much
everything
else
of
a
technical
nature
that
one
needs
to
write.
It
comes
in
handy.
I've
gotten
this
far
in
life
basically
writing
one
draft
of
expository
papers
(although
more
recently,
sadly,
that
has
begun
to
change).
As
long
as
I
have
my
thoughts
in
order,
there's
really
no
need
for
more.
I
can
remember
times
in
high
school
(where,
if
you
don't
have
at
least
three
drafts
of
a
paper,
you're
likely
to
be
sentenced
to
five
to
ten)
actually
going
back
and
inserting
mistakes
into
"earlier"
drafts,
because
peer-editing
never
did
much
for
me,
and
I
myself
rarely
saw
rough
spots
to
improve
upon.
In
retrospect,
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
someone
there
who
was
capable
of
truly
critiquing
what
I
was
writing,
but
it's
not
often
you
find
that
sort
of
individualized
attention
in
public
high
schools.
In
any
case,
getting
back
to
our
story
(don't
sigh,
it's
impolite),
I
spent
most
of
the
middle
school
years
(ages
ten
to
fourteen)
doing
creative
writing
of
all
sorts,
mostly
under
the
direction
of
English
and
Reading
teachers.
There
were
creative
writing
journals,
analysis
of
songs
lyrics
as
poetry,
short
stories,
anecdotes,
rudimentary
aspects
of
dialogue
and
plot
formation,
and
a
heavy
emphasis
on
description
and
imagery.
For
those
three
or
four
years,
I
was
basically
free
to
write
about
anything
that
I
could
imagine,
almost
always
with
a
pencil,
which
makes
the
whole
period
seem
that
much
more
lit'ry
and
romantic,
don't
you
think?
My
teachers
seemed
to
enjoy
it,
as
I
was
constantly
getting
comments
to
the
effect
of
"Beautiful
language"
or
"Excellent
story
line."
In
sixth
grade,
we
had
a
unit
on
book
making;
writing,
illustrating,
you
name
it.
If
it
pertained
to
books,
we
were
doing
it.
All
of
this
was
designed
to
lead
to
the
making
of
our
own
book,
which
everyone
would
have
the
opportunity
to
enter
in
the
National
Written
and
Illustrated
contest.
This
was
one
of
the
most
intensely
rewarding
and
just
purely
fun
activities
I
ever
completed
as
a
student.
I
wrote
a
story
about
elves
and
wizards
and
other
mystical
crap
(I
think
I'd
just
read
The
Lord
of
the
Rings
trilogy
for
the
second
time),
which,
as
it
turned
out,
wasn't
half-bad.
I
also
got
to
draw
all
the
pictures
and
stitch
the
pages
together,
which
was
pretty
cool.
Hell,
I
even
got
to
write
the
author
blurb
on
the
inside
of
the
makeshift
dust
jacket.
So
we
sent
them
away
to
the
contest,
return
addressed
to
our
individual
homes
since
it
was
near
the
end
of
the
school
year.
Sometime
around
the
end
of
July
(as
a
matter
of
fact,
probably
close
to
seven
years
ago
to
the
day
as
I
write
this
story)
I
got
a
package,
roughly
book
size
and
weight,
in
the
mail
from
the
folks
at
Written
and
Illustrated.
Sadly,
as
it
turns
out,
a
roughly
book
size
and
weight
package
is
no
good
in
those
kinds
of
contests,
because
it
means
they
sent
your
work
back
and
won't
be
publishing
it.
A
bit
of
a
downer,
but
hey,
there
are
greater
tragedies
in
this
world.
After
sifting
through
the
other
contents
of
the
package,
however,
I
found
a
letter
addressed
to
a
"Master
Conner."
It
said
(among
other
things)
that
I
had
placed
in
the
Top
100
out
of
more
than
7,000
entrants
in
the
contest.
While
math
is
my
relatively
weaker
field,
after
an
hour
or
two
of
calculation
I
concluded
that
this
was
pretty
damn
good.
They
also
sent
along
a
nice
certificate
of
achievement
with
some
shiny
red
lettering
that
my
mom
hung
on
the
refrigerator,
which
to
me
was
almost
as
good
as
winning
the
contest
anyhow.
Of
course,
there
was
the
occasional
book
report
or
lab
write-up,
but
they
were
few
and
far
between,
and
for
the
most
part
very
informal
in
both
their
structure
and
content.
It
wasn't
until
I
got
to
high
school
that
I
was
formally
introduced
to
any
truly
structured
writing.
Strangely
enough,
however,
I
had
no
problem
making
the
transition
from
creative
to
expository
composition,
perhaps
due
to
the
affinity
for
language
I
mentioned
earlier.
My
freshman
English
teacher,
Mr.
Wheeler,
who
even
then
was
old
enough
to
be
on
a
first
name
basis
with
God,
absolutely
loved
my
writing.
He'd
talk
about
the
work
being
done
in
the
class
in
front
of
everyone,
often
citing
my
literary
papers
and
arguments
as
"exemplary"
or
"college
level."
It
was
sort
of
embarrassing,
being
singled
out
like
that,
even
though
the
praise
was
nice
to
hear.
He
had
no
doubt
discussed
it
over
snifters
of
brandy
with
his
old
friend
God
the
night
before
and
decided
just
what
to
say
to
make
me
feel
the
maximum
amount
of
discomfort
and
social
torture.
I've
often
found
that
to
be
the
case
with
writing,
especially
good
writing
(or
at
least
what
I
consider
good).
There's
always
the
constant
struggle
between
wanting
to
share
it
and
wanting
to
hide
it,
that
interesting
mixture
of
pride
and
reticence
that
seems
to
sum
up
the
writing
experience,
at
least
for
me.
There's
always
the
chance
that
someone
won't
understand
what
you
were
trying
to
say.,
.or
worse,
they'll
understand,
but
they
just
won't
care.
So,
the
high
school
years
were
spent
writing
literary
criticisms
and
academic
papers,
along
with
lab
reports
and
other
highly
structured
forms
of
writing.
For
whatever
reason,
I
took
to
these
types
of
things
like
a
duck
to
water,
and
throughout
my
time
spent
at
LHS
I
can't
say
that
I
ever
really
learned
anything
from
a
teacher
concerning
academic
writing.
It
was
just
something
I
could
do,
and
do
well.
The
step-by-step
approach
my
English
teachers
gave
for
writing
papers
worked
(I
suppose)
but
it
always
made
things
feel
clinical
to
me,
and
I
never
really
followed
it
any
too
closely.
I
normally
just
sat
down
at
a
computer
and
wrote,
and
to
this
day
that's
my
method
of
choice
for
composition,
at
least
for
expository
writing.
I
rarely
read
over
what
I
write
before
handing
in
a
paper,
which
on
some
level
could
be
viewed
either
as
stupidity
or
arrogance,
but
it
hasn't
failed
me
yet.
My
one
regret
from
high
school
(concerning
writing,
anyhow)
is
not
taking
advantage
of
the
proximity
of
Bucknell.
One
of
my
ninth
grade
teachers
suggested
that
I
take
a
creative
writing
class
at
the
university,
but
for
no
reason
that
I
can
think
of
now,
I
never
did.
Looking
back,
there
was
a
solid
three
to
four
year
period
where
creative
writing,
by
and
large,
took
a
back
seat
to
more
academic
forms
of
composition.
Coming
to
college
was,
again,
an
easy
transition
(perhaps
because
I'd
spent
the
last
few
years
doing
nothing
besides
writing
papers),
and
assignments
I
was
given
were
easily
composed
and
generally
well
received.
My
FYS
professor
and
my
professor
for
ENG
206
(tested
out
of
College
Writing)
both
recommended
me
for
the
WA
program,
which
seems
fair
commendation.
The
latter
had
the
class
set
up
in
a
writing
portfolio
style,
which
was
something
new
to
me,
although
I
quickly
became
accustomed
to
it
and
wouldn't
mind
using
the
same
format
in
the
future.
For
what
was
basically
the
first
time,
I
began
to
actively
edit
my
papers
for
new
stylistic
devices
(such
as
contextualizing
quotes
and
engaging
literary
theories)
that
I
was
learning
about
in
the
classroom.
In
terms
of
expository
writing,
that
class
taught
me
more
than
I'd
learned
in
my
entire
time
in
high
school.
By
the
end
of
the
class
it
seemed
that
I'd
pretty
much
picked
up
and
mastered
most
of
the
techniques.
My
professor
cited
a
first
draft
of
one
of
the
latter
papers
I
submitted
for
class
as
"A
superb
paper."
It's
not
everyday
that
one
hears
the
word
"superb"
applied
to
them,
so
that
was
a
nice
ego
boost
as
well
(And
at
this
point
I
can
hear
someone
in
the
general
admission
seats
saying
"As
if
you
need
it,
you
egomaniac!")
Since
coming
to
Lafayette,
I've
also
begun
to
write
poetry
and
short
stories
again,
something
that
I
set
aside
in
high
school,
in
favor
of
sports,
art,
and
other
activities.
I'm
a
little
rusty,
but
things
are
beginning
to
come
back,
little
by
little.
One
of
these
days
I
might
even
write
something
I
truly
like.
It's
never
really
been
about
the
research
papers
for
me,
even
though
I've
probably
written
more
of
those
than
any
other
form
of
composition.
I
enjoy
the
creative
aspects
of
writing,
and
although
I
recognize
that
structure
is
very
important,
structure
for
structure's
sake
has
no
place
in
my
personal
writing
philosophy.
The
content
has
to
be
there
for
the
experience
to
count
for
anything.
And
the
fact
is,
I've
never
had
a
bad
experience
as
a
writer.
Just
a
regular
little
content-creator,
I
guess.
I've
written
literary
papers,
lab
reports,
poetry,
short
stories,
comedy
sketches,
song
lyrics,
satires,
forensic
argument,
and
plan
to
expand
my
genres
in
the
future.
It's
something
that
comes
easily
to
me,
and
looking
back,
I
see
it's
always
been
that
way,
for
better
or
worse.
Either
way,
I
think
I've
blown
enough
sunshine
my
way
for
one
afternoon.
