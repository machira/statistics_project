With
three
years
of
college
writing
experience,
and
two
years
of
WA
knowledge
under
my
belt,
I
am
excited
about
my
final
year
at
Lafayette.
I
am
up
for
the
challenge
of
intense
writing
assignments
(maybe
even
a
thesis!)
and
another
partnership
with
my
WA
class.
Over
the
last
year
I
have
become
more
established
as
a
writer
and
WA;
I
feel
more
comfortable
with
myself
and
my
abilities.
As
a
first
year
WA
I
remember
turning
to
one
of
my
friends,
who
was
also
a
first
time
WA,
and
saying,
NHow
are
we
even
qualified
to
do
this?O
The
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
we
were
both
budding
college
writers
with
a
strong
enthusiasm
for
the
writing
process.
Last
year
in
the
Watt
Room,
I
conversed
with
some
fellow
WAOs
about
the
NperksO
of
being
a
WA.
The
first
advantage
that
we
discussed
was
being
able
to
talking
about
language.
I
will
admit,
I
feel
a
little
nerdy
saying
this,
but
as
a
WA
IOve
become
excited
about
the
writing
process.
Perhaps
itOs
because
IOve
learned
that
thereOs
no
set
way
to
go
about
it.
No
need
to
write
out
your
research
on
index
cards,
then
move
to
an
outline,
followed
by
first
writing
the
introduction,
and
so
on.
High
school
writing
rules
flew
out
the
window,
and
in
the
staff
meetings
and
WA
training
I
learned
the
uniqueness
of
each
person
as
a
writer.
Because
of
this,
the
idea
of
each
person
having
their
own
style
or
being
able
to
experiment
with
their
different
ways
of
writing,
being
a
WA
became
even
more
challenging.
Another
advantage
we
discussed
to
being
a
WA
was
being
able
to
discuss
writing
techniques
with
an
audience
(the
student)
who
actually
cared
about
the
work.
Although
some
conferences
IOve
had
have
been
painful
to
try
to
engage
the
student,
students
are
mostly
concerned
about
their
writing,
and
up
for
the
personal
attention
that
a
WA
can
give.
In
my
final
year
of
WAing,
my
enthusiasm
for
discussing
the
writing
process
has
grown
tremendously.
As
I
reflect
on
the
2004-2005
school
year,
it
seems
that
that
section
of
my
college
career
was
the
most
difficult
and
rewarding
year
in
my
college
writing
experience.
In
both
the
fall
and
spring
semester
I
came
up
against
some
pretty
terrifying
writing
assignments.
While
studying
at
American
University
under
the
Peace
and
Conflict
Resolution
Program
in
the
fall,
I
was
encouraged
to
write
a
50
page
paper
on
a
research
topic
of
my
choice.
At
first
the
assignment
seemed
daunting,
especially
because
of
the
difficulty
of
my
subject.
I
chose
to
write
about
children
born
out
of
war
rape
in
the
former
Yugoslavia,
since
our
class
had
just
returned
from
an
extensive
trip
thru
the
Balkans.
During
and
after
our
trip
I
was
able
to
conduct
interviews
with
various
people
that
were
vital
to
this
clearly
under
researched
topic.
This
assignment
was
difficult
because
I
had
never
written
a
paper
of
that
length,
nor
including
new
research
tools
like
interviews
and
other
primary
sources.
I
learned
quickly
that
well-conducted
research
is
a
crucial
component
of
a
successful
writing
experience.
I
found
myself
running
to
the
library
for
more
information
while
I
was
writing
my
paper.
Like
research,
pre-writing,
and
having
a
clear
idea
of
where
your
thesis
is
going
is
another
key
part
of
the
writing.
Because
I
was
so
general
about
my
topic,
at
first,
I
was
unable
to
focus
my
writing
until
I
narrowed
down
my
scope.
Likewise,
my
spring
semester
back
at
Lafayette
proved
to
be
equally
as
demanding
with
four
major
research
projects
all
happening
at
the
same
time.
As
a
writer
I
learned
the
value
of
time
management
the
hard
way.
I
did
miss
a
few
deadlines
because
of
poor
planning;
however,
in
the
end,
I
landed
on
top.
Besides
learning
how
to
work
on
multiple
writing
projects
at
the
same
time,
I
was
also
forced
to
realize
that
not
all
writing
projects
are
created
equal.
In
other
words,
the
writing
techniques
that
work
for
one
project
may
not
work
for
another,
or
they
may
not
be
the
best
suited
for
that
topic.
For
instance,
I
found
that
my
method
of
outlining
first,
then
writing
was
great
for
a
paper
that
was
largely
based
on
class
readings;
yet,
for
a
research
project
on
a
topic
I
was
fairly
ignorant
to,
I
needed
to
research
well,
then
start
writing,
and
organize
as
I
went
along.
While
these
writing
experiences
impacted
my
writing
methodology,
I
was
also
affected
by
the
students
in
my
WA
class.
I
was
a
WA
for
Professor
SeetchOs
English
110,
which
explored
different
types
of
written
work
(editorial,
letter,
memoir,
etc)
and
included
a
community
service
component.
Each
student
was
required
to
volunteer
for
the
semester
and
journal
about
their
experiences.
Furthermore,
much
of
their
writing
outside
of
their
journal
revolved
around
their
community
service.
It
should
be
noted
that
my
WAing
experience
has
been
somewhat
unique
in
that
I
have
only
worked
with
first-year
writers.
This
has
given
me
the
opportunity
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
needs
of
freshmen
writers
as
they
engage
in
their
first
college
writing
experiences.
Though
there
is
a
bit
of
a
difference
between
the
fall
and
spring
semester
for
a
first
year
writer,
their
needs
are
basically
the
same.
First-years
are
adjusting
to
the
standards
of
college
writing,
while
simultaneously
diving
into
the
writing
process.
This
plunge
is
exciting
for
me
to
be
a
part
of,
especially
because
by
the
end
of
the
semester
I
can
see
a
great
improvement
as
to
how
the
students
write,
but
also
about
how
they
talk
about
their
writing
and
critique
their
work
and
their
peersO.
One
particularly
interesting
aspect
of
my
WAing
for
this
class
was
that
I
was
able
to
conduct
individual
and
group
conferences.
Starting
off
with
two
individual
conferences
with
each
writer
allowed
me
to
get
to
know
each
student
and
get
a
feel
for
their
confidence
level
as
writers.
After
these
sessions,
Professor
Seetch
suggested
that
I
conducted
group
conferences
for
two
different
projects.
I
was
leery
about
having
group
conferences
from
the
start.
Other
WAOs
had
cringed
had
my
mention
of
group
conferences,
and
were
sure
to
tell
me
that
it
was
a
pain
because:
not
everyone
shows
up,
some
students
donOt
read
all
the
papers,
only
a
few
students
actually
talk
during
the
conference,
and
the
conferences
usually
drag
out
for
a
while
because
you
have
multiple
drafts
to
review.
My
other
reservation
about
the
group
sessions
was
that
my
role
as
a
WA
would
change.
During
an
individual
conference
the
WA
has
the
responsibility
to
focus
solely
on
one
student.
In
this
respect,
the
student
can
set
the
agenda
and
voice
his
or
her
concerns
freely
to
a
WA,
who
is
an
educated
peer
reviewer.
I
take
pride
in
the
fact
that
most
writers
that
meet
with
WAOs
have
confidence
in
their
WAOs
ability
and
feel
comfortable
asking
for
advice
or
listening
to
suggestions
for
improvement.
Yet,
with
a
group
conference,
I
feared
that
my
role
would
shrink
because
each
student
would
get
writing
feedback
from
his
or
her
peers
first,
then
I
could
jump
in
with
my
comments.
My
role,
which
I
stated
before
the
group
sessions
began,
was
as
the
facilitator
of
the
conversation;
I
would
keep
them
on
track
and
interject
only
when
it
was
appropriate.
I
have
to
say
that
with
my
enthusiasm
for
writing
and
discussing
language,
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
sit
back,
at
first,
and
watch
the
students
run
the
show;
however,
as
time
progressed
I
acquired
better
listening
skills,
which
in
turn
made
me
more
sensitive
to
each
writersO
needs.
From
what
I
gather
from
my
students,
being
a
peer
reviewer
and
conducting
group
conferences
was
a
tremendous
help.
During
the
conference
they
enjoyed
giving
feedback
to
their
peers,
using
the
skills
they
learned
in
class.
At
first
it
surprised
me
to
see
that
the
two
or
three
peer
reviewers
hit
on
higher
order
concerns
that
I
noted
on
the
studentOs
paper,
rather
than
focusing
on
lower
order
concerns
like
grammar.
I
was
glad
to
know
that
the
students
were
gaining
skills
and
using
them
freely
and
creatively.
Another
interesting
aspect
of
these
group
sessions
was
that
the
students,
for
the
most
part,
gave
the
same
respect
and
confidence
to
their
peer
critics
as
they
did
with
me;
each
student
was
respected
as
an
educated
reader.
My
part
in
the
group
sessions,
although
not
the
leading
contributor
to
giving
suggestions
on
how
to
enhance
the
writing,
involved
keeping
the
conversation
going
by
asking
questions
to
challenge
the
writer
or
the
reviewers.
For
instance,
I
would
ask
the
writer,
NWhat
are
your
concerns
about
the
draft
that
you
would
like
to
discuss
today?O
After
they
replied
with
a
few
main
concerns
I
would
ask,
NIs
there
any
particular
area
youOd
like
us
to
look
at?O
I
also
made
sure
to
include
positive
reinforcement
in
the
conferences.
If
I
saw
something
great
on
a
page,
like
a
good
metaphor
or
a
strong
thesis
statement,
I
would
tell
the
writer
and
also
ask,
NDoes
anyone
else
have
areas
of
XOs
paper
that
they
really
enjoyed?O
and
follow
with,
NAnd
why
did
you
like
that
part?O
If
someone
made
a
remark,
such
as
NIt
doesnOt
flow,O
I
would
counter
with,
NOk,
can
you
give
us
an
example
of
that
from
the
text?O
As
these
sessions
progressed,
I
definitely
saw
improvement
in
their
writing
and
their
discussion
of
writing.
Many
of
the
students
were
using
jargon
like
thesis,
clarity,
sentence
structure,
and
transition.
This
was
another
exciting
aspect
of
the
group
sessions
for
me,
not
because
they
were
being
more
NproperO
in
their
critiques,
using
more
sophisticated
language;
rather,
the
students
were
getting
more
and
more
specific
as
to
what
was
particularly
good
in
a
paper
or
what
specifically
needed
improvement.
In
a
way,
I
was
viewing
my
own
growth
as
a
WA.
I
started
out
to
being
too
sure
about
my
comments
and
feeling
less
confident
in
my
ability
to
be
critical;
however,
as
the
conferences
continued
I
gained
self-assurance
and
was
able
to
enjoy
the
conferences
rather
than
be
apprehensive
of
them.
With
all
that
being
said,
itOs
important
to
realize
that
group
conferences
had
to
be
tailored
to
each
class.
These
sessions
worked
particularly
well
because
the
students:
1)
Had
a
consistent
exposure
to
peer
review
in
their
writing
class,
2)
They
all
had
the
same
assignment,
but
were
writing
about
different
volunteering
or
personal
experiences,
so
no
two
essays
were
alike,
3)
The
groups
were
randomly
selected
by
Professor
Seetch
and
most
people
did
the
work.
IOm
not
sure
that
this
would
work
with
a
literature
class
where
everyone
was
given
the
same
essay
question
about
a
novel;
I
think
their
theses
might
be
too
similar,
and
the
conference
might
become
more
about
the
content
of
the
paper
than
the
actual
writing.
As
you
can
see,
the
group
conferences
were
something
that
I
found
beneficial
to
my
WA
experience.
The
enhanced
listening
skills
that
I
acquired
thru
conducting
those
conferences
as
helped
me
to
sit
back
and
let
the
writer
do
the
explaining.
That
was
actually
one
of
my
concerns
that
I
voiced
in
the
WA
staff
meetings.
I
asked
my
fellow
WAOs,
NWhat
to
do
if
you
feel
like
youOre
talking
too
much
in
a
conference,
and
the
student
is
relying
on
your
comments
to
continue
the
conference?O
One
suggestion
was
to
ask
more
leading
questions,
such
as
the
ones
I
listed
earlier
in
my
discussion
of
the
group
conferences.
I
found
that
it
was
okay
to
challenge
a
student
on
his
or
her
comments
or
ask,
NThis
part
seems
a
little
unclear,
can
you
explain
to
me
why
you
used
their
word
choice?O
Although
it
might
be
difficult
for
the
writer
to
pinpoint
their
reasoning
behind
their
words,
it
shows
that
the
WA
has
done
a
close
reading
and
is
interested
in
understanding
the
writerOs
process.
Even
though
this
method
has
proved
helpful,
IOve
learned
that
itOs
not
good
to
constantly
challenge
or
question
a
student;
you
donOt
want
to
make
them
feel
threatened,
or
like
the
WA
is
the
authority
and
the
student
is
only
a
writing
novice
with
no
experience.
Another
bit
of
advice
that
IOve
taken
from
other
WAOs
has
been
the
Nless
is
moreO
idea
for
writing
comments
on
papers.
Some
WAOs
suggested
using
Post-it
notes
or
writing
comments
on
a
separate
piece
of
paper.
For
me,
I
just
cut
down
my
written
comments
to
symbols,
like
NAKWO
or
a
star
next
to
a
sentence.
These
became
triggers
for
me,
and
did
not
distract
the
student
as
we
went
thru
the
paper.
Also,
I
encouraged
the
students
to
write
as
the
conference
was
going
on
so
that
they
could
remember
what
changes
they
wanted
to
make
instead
of
reading
my
comments
and
wondering
what
I
meant
later
on.
Besides
this
advice
from
fellow
WAOs,
IOve
also
being
able
to
see
that
writing
is
a
process,
and
that
even
if
a
draft
of
a
paper
comes
out
more
unpolished
than
I
thought
it
would
be,
I
wonOt
say
NitOs
such
a
bad
paper.O
Just
as
I
would
never
say
that
to
a
student,
I
shouldnOt
ever
critique
myself
in
the
same
way.
Instead,
I
realize
that
a
draft
is
a
huge
sign
of
process,
if
completed
whole-heartedly
because
it
shows
the
first
steps
of
a
finished
work.
I
hope
to
maintain
this
mentality
in
my
own
writing,
even
as
my
senior
year
approaches
and
I
see
large
project
looming
ahead.
My
summer
has
been
filed
with
editing
at
my
summer
internship,
as
well
as
critiquing
poetry
with
a
few
friends
in
our
informal
writing
circle.
I
hope
to
bring
both
of
these
experiences
to
my
first
WA
assignment
of
the
year.
Both
summer
writing
projects
have
forced
me
to
look
critically
at
different
forms
of
writing,
and
varying
writersO
styles.
All
in
all,
IOm
ready
to
get
the
year
started
as
a
WA
and
excited
about
engaging
my
peers
in
discussions
about
writing
once
again.
