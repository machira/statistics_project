WRITING
ASSOCIATE
NARRATIVE
September
3,1998
Professor
Donahue
Department
of
English
Here
I
am,
in
my
final
year
at
Lafayette
College.
This
is
also
my
third
year
as
a
writing
associate.
Even
though
I
have
only
worked
with
one
professor
throughout
the
years,
I
feel
that
I
have
experienced
many
things
which
I
would
like
to
share
with
the
up
and
coming
writing
associates.
I
have
decided
to
write
my
narrative
in
a
slightly
different
way.
I
will
be
writing
about
specific
letters,
which
have
their
own
individual
importance,
but
which
also
join
together
to
form
one
ultimate
word
that
is
essential
for
all
writing
associates.
The
first
important
letter
to
remember
is
the
letter
C.
C
stands
for
character,
and
character
is
a
crucial
element
of
any
good
writing
associate.
In
my
own
experience
over
the
last
three
years,
I
have
found
that
it
is
necessary
to
let
your
students
know
that
you
are
of
strong
character
and
are
therefore
determined
to
work
hard
and
make
sure
you
do
your
best
to
improve
their
papers.
If
students
feel
that
your
main
objective
in
being
a
writing
associate
is
to
merely
gain
extra
beer
money
for
the
weekends,
then
they
will
quickly
lose
all
interests
in
your
ability
and
become
extremely
unresponsive
for
the
entire
meeting.
However,
if
you
present
yourselves
as
someone
who
truly
cares
about
their
writing
and
the
writing
process
in
general,
your
student
will
be
much
more
inclined
to
entrust
you
with
their
work.
The
bottom
line
is
that
students
are
usually
presenting
work
to
you
which
they
have
put
a
good
deal
of
time
and
interests
into
writing.
If
they
did
not
care
about
the
work,
then
chances
are
they
would
not
have
bothered
to
write
a
complete
draft
and
show
up
for
the
meeting.
It
is
crucial
to
let
the
students
know
that
you
understand
the
importance
of
their
writing
and
that
you
place
an
equal
level
of
importance
on
helping
them
to
improve
that
writing.
Another
area
in
which
character
plays
a
key
role
is
in
drawing
strict
boundaries
with
the
students.
For
example,
it
is
necessary
to
let
your
students
know
that
you
will
not
write
their
paper
for
them
,
at
any
cost.
Unfortunately,
I
have
had
numerous
students
offer
me
money
in
return
for
my
services
in
writing
their
paper.
Of
course,
I
refused
and
let
the
students
know
that
that
kind
of
demand
was
beneath
my
character
as
a
Lafayette
College
Writing
Associate.
The
same
ethical
principles
can
be
applied
to
cases
when
students
want
to
know
what
kind
of
grade
the
professor
will
give
their
paper.
In
these
situations
I
find
it
best
to
simply
state
that,
as
a
responsible
writing
associate,
I
am
forbidden
to
estimate
any
grades
for
students.
It
is
also
crucial
to
remember
to
keep
the
same
level
of
high
character
with
all
your
students,
whether
they
are
your
dorm
mates,
or
complete
strangers.
I
know
that
these
rules
may
sound
a
bit
stringent,
but
they
are
definitely
necessary
in
order
to
maintain
a
good,
working
relationship
with
the
students.
Once
you
gain
the
respect
of
the
students,
the
whole
process
of
improving
their
paper
becomes
ten
times
easier.
The
next
important
letter
is
the
letter
O.
0
stands
for
observant
and
being
observant
is
at
the
core
of
any
decent
writing
associate's
list
of
traits.
Being
observant
means
reading
a
paper
and
making
sure
you
really
understand
what
each
particular
author
is
truly
trying
to
say.
Being
observant
also
means
being
able
to
catch
patterns
of
writing
errors
in
an
essay.
For
example,
I
have
found
that
by
repeatedly
misplacing
commas,
many
students
have
completely
altered
the
true
meanings
of
their
essays
and
have
caused
the
essay
to
be
quite
incomprehensible.
However,
by
closely
reading
the
essay,
I
was
able
to
see
that
by
switching
around
the
position
of
commas,
the
essay
completely
transformed
itself
into
a
very
decent
piece
of
writing.
If
I
had
not
been
observant
while
I
was
reading
his/her
essay,
then
I
would
have
just
thought
that
his/her
writing
abilities
were
extremely
poor.
However,
since
I
was
observant,
I
was
able
to
catch
one
single
error
which,
if
corrected,
could
transform
her
entire
writing.
The
student
was
very
happy
to
find
out
that
she
could
improve
her
writing
by
simply
paying
more
attention
to
the
proper
usage
of
a
comma.
It
is
equally
as
significant
to
be
observant
of
a
student's
mood
as
it
is
to
be
observant
of
a
student's
writing.
I
have
found
that
it
is
important
read
a
student
and
find
out
whether
he/she
is
frustrated,
bored,
responsive,
unresponsive,
etc.....
If
a
writing
associate
can
read
a
student's
mood
and
respond
in
the
proper
manner,
the
student
is
much
more
likely
to
feel
comfortable
with
the
writing
associate
and
therefore
be
more
willing
to
become
an
active
member
of
the
meeting.
I
am
always
blatantly
honest
with
the
students.
For
example,
if
it
definitely
feels
that
they
are
bored
and
disinterested,
I
ask
them
why
they
are
bored
and
disinterested
and
what
I
can
do
to
remedy
the
situation.
However,
it
is
important
to
remember
not
to
bad
mouth
the
Professor
or
put
down
the
writing
assignment,
because
this
type
of
action
is
a
catastrophe
in
the
making.
The
third
and
fourth
letter
is
the
letter
M.
M
stands
for
the
word
manage,
as
in
time
management.
It
is
crucial
for
every
writing
associate
to
manage
their
time
wisely
so
they
are
able
to
give
each
student's
paper
the
time
it
needs
and
give
each
student
the
time
he/she
deserves.
For
me,
this
was
one
of
the
most
difficult
parts
of
being
a
writing
associate.
It
is
extremely
hard
to
manage
your
time
when
you
have
three
of
your
own
massive
essays
due
the
same
week
that
the
Professor
you
work
has
his
or
her
student's
major
essay
of
the
marking
period
due.
But,
the
hard
and
plain
truth
is
that
we
are
all
informed
of
these
assignments
in
advice
and
are
therefore
responsible
for
getting
the
assignments
completed
in
such
a
manner
that
allows
us,
as
employed
writing
associates,
to
have
the
proper
amount
of
time
devoted
to
our
jobs.
However,
it
is
also
important
that
the
professor
you
work
for
understands
that
it
is
also
his/her
responsibility
to
inform
you
of
all
his/her
assignments
in
advance
and
that
you
and
your
particular
professor
have
an
understanding
of
how
much
time
you
are
required
to
meet
with
the
students.
If
your
professor
is
constantly
making
you
work
more
hours
with
the
students
than
you
are
supposed
to
work,
let
your
professor
know.
If
you
have
set
out
guidelines
with
your
professor
at
the
beginning
of
the
semester,
then
you
should
have
little
difficulty
in
changing
your
hours
back
to
your
original
required
hours.
The
fifth
letter
is
the
letter
U.
U
stands
for
unique.
I
have
found
that
adding
a
little
extra
something
to
my
meetings
with
students
usually
helps
lighten
the
mood
of
the
meeting
and
puts
the
student
more
at
ease
to
discuss
his/her
writing.
I
usually
try
to
strike
up
some
conversation
with
the
student
before
I
truly
get
involved
in
writing
the
paper.
I
feel
that
this
helps
make
the
meeting
a
unique
and
individual
experience
for
the
student,
rather
than
just
a
typical
cookie-cutter
writing
associate
lecture/meeting.
I
also
like
to
try
and
make
light
of
situations
whenever
I
can
by
using
some
humor
or
being
extremely
blunt
with
the
students.
This
usually
adds
a
little
shock
value
to
the
meeting,
which
keeps
the
students
form
getting
too
bored.
If
the
meeting
goes
off
on
a
slight
tangent
in
a
direction
away
from
the
essay
at
hand,
I
usually
allow
the
conversation
to
flow,
as
long
as
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
student's
receiving
adequate
time
to
discuss
his/her
paper.
In
my
own
personal
experience,
making
each
meeting
different
from
the
next
not
only
helps
keep
the
students
involved,
but
it
keeps
the
writing
associate
involved
as
well.
The
sixth
letter
is
the
letter
N.
The
letter
n
begins
the
word
notify.
It
is
absolutely
essential
that
you
keep
the
professor
you
work
for
notified
of
the
experiences
you
are
having
as
his/her
writing
associate.
For
example,
if
you
are
receiving
very
poor
work
from
a
particular
student
who
seems
extremely
frustrated
and
confused
at
the
assignment,
let
your
professor
know.
Likewise,
if
you
are
continually
getting
students
who
do
not
comprehend
the
assignment,
let
your
professor
know
that
he/she
needs
to
explain
the
assignment
more
clearly
with
the
class.
Also
let
your
professor
know
if
he/she
is
doing
a
particularly
good
job
of
explaining
the
assignment,
because
even
professors
like
to
know
when
they
are
doing
their
job
well.
Keeping
your
Professor
well
informed
about
his/her
class
will
not
only
help
your
professor
and
his/her
students,
it
will
also
help
you,
as
their
writing
associate,
because
you
will
see
improved
attitudes
and
essays
form
the
class.
The
seventh
letter
is
the
letter
I.
I
is
the
first
letter
in
the
word
Impression.
It
is
very
important
to
give
the
professor
you
work
for
as
well
as
his/her
students
a
good
impression
of
yourself
as
a
devoted
student
and
employee.
If
your
students
feel
that
you,
as
their
writing
associate,
really
do
not
care
about
your
own
studies,
or
about
the
writing
process
in
general,
they
will
feel
justified
in
neglecting
their
own
essays.
Therefore,
it
is
essential
that
writing
associates
refrain
form
comments
which
put
down
the
student's
assignment
or
the
writing
process
at
Lafayette
College
in
general.
Comments
such
as
,
I
know
this
assignment
sucks
,
or
I
am
glad
I
don't
have
to
be
bothered
writing
this
paper
,
or
even,
When
I
had
this
professor
I
really
blew
off
this
assignment
,
are
a
guaranteed
ingredient
in
any
disastrous
writing
associate
meeting.
The
eight
letter
is
the
letter
C,
which
we
have
already
discussed
in
its
association
with
the
word
character.
Therefore,
we
will
quickly
move
onto
the
ninth
letter,
A.
A
stands
for
achieve.
Everyone
has
the
potential
to
improve
their
writing,
no
matter
who
they
are.
It
is
important
that
each
student
who
comes
in
for
a
writing
associate
meeting
understands
that
they
are
not
at
the
meeting
because
they
are
horrible
writers
who
are
in
desperate
need
of
help.
I
try
to
let
all
my
students
know
that
they
are
at
the
meeting
to
improve
on
their
writing
skills,
not
to
be
criticized
or
humiliated.
I
try
to
tell
them
that
everyone
needs
a
writing
associate,
even
other
writing
associates.
Everyone
can
achieve
more
in
their
writing
and
it
is
often
difficult
to
improve
upon
your
own
writing
without
an
outside
opinion.
Being
that
third
person,
I
explain,
is
my
job
as
a
writing
associate.
I
also
feel
that
my
own
writing
has
improved
through
being
exposed
to
the
varied
writings
of
the
students
I
help.
Everyone
has
different
writing
skills,
and
I
honestly
believe
we
can
all
achieve
more
by
learning
from
each
other's
writing
talents
and
flaws.
The
tenth
letter
is
the
letter
T.
T
is
the
first
letter
in
the
word
teach.
In
my
experience,
I
have
found
that
I
am
constantly
learning
from
the
other
Lafayette
College
writing
associates.
The
weekly
meetings
are
extremely
important
because
it
is
an
opportunity
for
writing
associates
to
continually
teach
their
fellow
writing
associates
how
to
do
their
jobs
even
better.
As
we
sit
at
the
table
and
share
our
experiences,
we
are
teaching
each
other
as
well
as
bonding
to
each
other
as
a
solid
group.
I
also
feel
that
the
lessons
we
receive
each
week
regarding
grammar
help
teach
us
crucial
skills
which
we
may
have
forgotten.
Grammar
is
extremely
complex
and
highly
technical.
I
am
not
embarrassed
to
admit
that
I
have
learned
a
great
deal
from
those
grammar
sessions
on
Wednesdays.
The
final
letter
is
the
letter
E.
E
is
the
first
letter
in
the
word
enjoy.
This
word
is
perhaps
the
most
substantial
word
of
all
the
words
thus
far.
A
writing
associate
must
always
remember
that
they
are
doing
their
job
because
he/she
enjoys
to
write
and
he/she
enjoys
working
with
other
people
to
help
them
write.
If
you
do
not
enjoy
your
job
as
a
writing
associate,
the
students
you
are
trying
to
help
will
feel
as
if
they
are
a
burden
to
you.
I
have
found
that
students
know
when
you,
as
a
writing
associate,
are
annoyed
with
your
job.
Their
response
will
be
to
withdraw
from
the
meeting
and
become
highly
unresponsive.
It
is
crucial
to
make
the
students
feel
that
you
enjoy
working
with
them
and
that
they
are
in
no
way,
shape
or
form
a
burden
of
any
kind.
If
you
do
not
enjoy
your
job
as
a
writing
associate,
you
should
definitely
find
another
job
for
next
semester.
Okay,
I
know
the
suspense
is
killing
you.
What
word
did
all
those
letters
spell?
The
word
is
COMMUNICATE.
This,
for
me,
is
the
most
essential
element
of
being
an
effective
writing
associate.
Writing
associates
must
communicate
constantly
with
the
professor
they
work
for
as
well
as
the
professors
in
charge
of
the
WA
program.
They
must
also
communicate
with
their
fellow
writing
associates.
Finally,
it
is
crucial
to
communicate
with
your
students
at
each
and
every
meeting.
After
all,
communication
is
what
writing
is
all
about.
