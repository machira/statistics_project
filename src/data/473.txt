NWriting
as
a
WAO
My
writing
over
the
past
year
has
changed
as
I,
as
a
writer,
have
developed.
By
comparing
this
narrative
to
the
one
I
wrote
last
year,
it
is
clear
that
my
experiences
as
a
WA
have
affected
my
approach
to
writing
and
my
writing
style.
Last
fall
was
my
first
semester
as
a
WA
and
everything
that
I
learned
has
affected
my
own
writing.
In
the
past
year,
the
most
crucial
writing
experiences
happened
when
I
studied
in
London
for
a
semester.
What
I
learned
from
the
writing
program
and
helping
others
with
their
writing
was
extremely
beneficial
in
allowing
me
to
easily
adjust
to
a
different
educational
system,
writing
style
and
expectations.
Since
I
have
only
been
a
WA
for
one
semester,
I
have
relatively
limited
WA
experiences
to
include
in
my
writing
history.
This
is
not
to
say
that
these
experiences
have
not
been
important
and
have
not
transformed
my
approach
to
my
own
writing
and
to
helping
others
adjust
to
college
writing.
Going
to
school
in
a
foreign
country
was
like
entering
college
all
over
again.
This
time
I
had
the
experience
of
working
as
a
WA
to
help
myself
adjust
to
the
new
writing
requirements.
Working
as
a
WA
has
allowed
me
to
grow
as
a
writer
and
has
enabled
me
to
adapt
to
the
different
writing
experiences
I
have
had
in
the
past
year
and
also
in
the
years
to
come.
Many
of
my
writing
experiences
have
been
typical.
Between
conferences
with
students
and
writing
my
own
papers,
I
had
become
adjusted
to
the
writing
expectations
at
Lafayette.
When
I
went
to
London,
the
advisors
made
it
clear
to
us
that
there
was
a
different
style
of
writing
and
not
to
assume
that
how
we
write
in
the
United
States
would
be
acceptable
there.
From
the
way
the
British
courses
are
structured
and
the
assignments,
to
the
research
that
is
expected
for
a
passing
paper
and
to
the
grading
process,
it
took
me
a
while
to
get
used
to
the
differences.
It
seemed
that
before
I
had
completely
adjusted
to
the
different
style,
I
had
already
handed
in
my
papers
and
taken
my
final
examinations.
My
experiences
as
a
WA
helped
me
to
adjust
to
this
new
and
different
style.
As
I
had
worked
to
assist
others
in
learning
to
adapt
to
the
new
style
and
expectation
of
college
writing,
I
used
my
own
advice
to
help
myself
adjust
in
a
new
environment.
It
seems
that
the
most
difficult
writing
experiences
are
also
the
most
rewarding.
My
rewarding
experiences
have
come
from
both
helping
other
students
and
writing
my
own
papers.
For
example,
watching
a
student
who
began
the
semester
having
difficulty
understanding
assignments
and
structuring
a
paper,
but
by
the
end
of
the
semester
who
was
able
to
take
an
assignment
and
outline
their
ideas
into
a
solid
paper.
Also,
working
hard
and
putting
a
great
deal
of
effort
into
one
of
my
own
papers,
so
that
by
the
time
I
turned
it
in
I
was
proud
of
my
paper
and
most
likely
of
the
grade
I
would
also
receive.
Seeing
studentsO
and
my
own
progress
is
extremely
rewarding
and
a
testament
to
the
hard
work
and
effort
put
into
the
papers.
Through
the
student
conferences
I
saw
myself
changing
and
developing
my
writing
identity.
I
have
always
had
my
own
unique
writing
style
and
identity,
but
when
you
have
to
use
your
own
techniques
in
order
to
help
others,
you
realize
your
own
strengths
and
weaknesses.
Also,
my
writing
process
has
changed
since
I
became
a
WA.
Once
you
have
to
teach
someone
else
certain
writing
techniques
that
you
know
but
do
not
always
follow
in
your
own
writing,
you
start
using
these
techniques
in
your
own
writing.
Since
I
became
a
WA,
I
am
now
more
conscious
of
my
writing
process.
I
use
new
disciplines
that
include
a
more
structured
and
systematic
approach
to
writing.
In
the
past
year
I
have
not
encountered
any
new
expectations
from
different
audiences
mainly
because
I
have
only
been
writing
for
political
science
and
law
professors.
The
only
difference
in
the
audiences
was
professors
at
Lafayette
compared
to
my
professors
in
London.
Some
obstacles
with
being
a
WA
that
I
have
encountered
over
the
past
year
range
from
uninterested
students
to
difficulties
with
professors.
I
have
had
to
learn
new
techniques
in
order
to
get
completely
uninterested
students
participating
in
the
conferences.
Conferences
can
be
the
most
frustrating
and
also
the
most
rewarding
part
of
being
a
WA.
Problems
with
a
professor
who
you
are
a
WA
for
can
be
especially
difficult
to
handle.
Writing
associates
can
be
in
a
hard
position
because
professors
sometimes
expect
things
that
are
required
of
a
WA.
Also,
it
is
difficult
to
know
exactly
what
a
professor
expects
of
the
WA
and
the
students,
especially
if
you
have
never
had
that
professor
before.
My
biggest
problem
with
a
professor
has
been
that
despite
our
conversations
about
the
assignment,
I
understood
and
approached
the
assignment
differently
than
what
he
was
looking
for.
What
made
the
situation
worse
was
that
instead
of
talking
to
me
about
the
misunderstanding,
the
professor
proceeded
to
tell
the
students
not
to
listen
to
what
I
said
in
conferences.
Professors
need
to
be
clear
in
their
assignments
and
expectations
for
the
students
and
the
WA.
Also,
it
needs
to
be
made
clear
to
the
professors
what
role
the
WA
plays
in
the
writing
process.
After
my
experiences
last
fall
involving
the
misunderstanding
with
a
professor
on
an
assignment,
I
have
begun
to
ask
more
questions
of
my
professors.
I
no
longer
assume
that
I
know
what
the
professor
is
expecting
from
the
assignment
prompt,
but
instead
find
myself
asking
the
unanticipated.
I
try
to
cover
all
the
bases
and
look
at
the
assignment
from
every
angle.
Also,
I
discuss
the
paper
topic
with
other
students
and
the
professor
so
I
can
best
comprehend
the
assignment.
One
of
the
things
that
have
changed
most
with
my
writing
in
the
past
year
has
been
the
new
expectations
I
have
of
myself
and
of
my
writing.
Since
I
have
become
a
WA
I
have
been
more
conscious
of
what
I
write
and
how
I
write
it.
I
have
tried
to
apply
what
I
tell
the
students
to
my
own
writing.
This
way
I
can
determine
if
my
advice
is
helpful
or
if
there
is
another
way
to
make
something
clear.
I
used
to
just
write
and
make
sure
I
followed
the
assignment
as
I
was
writing,
but
I
was
not
as
aware
of
how
I
was
writing.
I
never
had
a
distinct
writing
approach
that
I
followed,
but
now
that
I
have
become
a
WA
I
feel
that
my
writing
is
more
structured
and
that
I
have
an
outline
in
my
head
that
I
use
a
guideline
for
all
of
my
papers.
When
I
write
a
research
paper,
I
am
constantly
thinking
about
format:
Do
I
have
an
introduction,
body
and
conclusion?
Do
I
have
introductory
sentences
in
each
paragraph
and
does
the
paper
flow?
Do
I
have
transitions?
I
have
not
challenged
the
advice
I
have
given
out
to
other
writers,
mainly,
because
I
try
not
to
give
advice
I
would
not
use
on
my
own
papers.
I
believe
that
there
is
a
criterion
for
structure,
format
and
organization
but
all
writers
have
their
own
unique
style.
What
works
for
one
writer
wonOt
necessarily
work
for
another
writer.
I
try
to
approach
each
writer
with
advice
I
have
either
been
given
or
discovered
on
my
own
to
be
useful
and
tell
them
up
front
that
this
may
or
may
not
help
you
with
your
writing.
There
are
rules
in
writing,
but
it
seems
that
the
greatest
writers
always
break
them.
They
probably
were
not
writing
for
a
specific
class
and
professor
when
their
works
became
recognized.
In
order
to
help
someone
write
you
have
to
take
into
consideration
their
writing
style
and
make
it
clear
to
them
that
their
writing
style
can
incorporate
the
rules
and
guidelines
their
professors
expect
them
to
follow.
Unless
it
is
a
creative
piece,
most
other
assignments
have
relatively
strict
guidelines
that
must
be
followed.
When
students
are
given
creative
assignments,
I
encourage
them
to
try
to
break
out
of
the
mold
they
are
used
to
writing
in
and
consider
different
techniques
and
formats
for
writing.
Creative
assignments
are
about
the
only
time
I
break
rules
that
I
take
as
being
absolute,
mostly
because
in
college
you
spend
most
of
your
time
writing
research
papers
and
lab
reports
that
require
certain
guidelines
to
be
followed
in
order
to
receive
a
good
grade.
Unfortunately,
in
college
most
students
usually
write
for
a
good
grade
instead
of
for
themselves.
Many
times
during
my
experiences
as
a
WA
I
have
turned
to
other
WAs
for
invaluable
advice.
Other
WAs
are
experiencing
or
have
experienced
in
the
past
the
same
situations
I
find
myself
in.
They
have
learned
to
communicate
effectively
with
students
and
professors.
Even
if
my
particular
situation
is
unlike
anything
they
have
experienced,
WAs
can
at
least
offer
advice
on
how
they
would
handle
the
situation.
The
most
help
has
come
from
a
WA
who
has
either
been
a
WA
for
a
particular
professor
or
has
had
that
professor
in
class
in
the
past.
This
has
helped
tremendously
in
order
to
discover
those
unsaid
expectations
professors
have
for
their
assignments.
Also,
it
helps
because
most
WAs
have
never
been
in
the
classroom
with
that
professor
and
do
not
know
what
actually
goes
on
and
has
been
explained
to
students
during
class.
Furthermore,
staff
meetings
provide
a
great
opportunity
to
ask
for
advice
from
many
different
WAs
and
even
provide
them
with
a
good
laugh
now
and
again
with
your
stories.
When
I
had
my
first
student
writers
in
conferences,
I
used
my
previous
experience
as
a
student
in
order
to
make
them
comfortable
and
confident
in
my
abilities.
The
students
who
wanted
to
improve
their
work
took
my
advice
because
I
tried
to
remind
them
that
I
was
in
their
same
position
two
years
ago.
There
are
always
those
students
who
come
to
the
conferences
only
because
they
are
required.
For
these
students
it
was
necessary
to
work
harder
in
order
to
get
them
engaged
in
the
conference.
When
students
do
not
willingly
participate
in
the
conferences,
I
kindly
remind
them
that
this
is
part
of
their
grade
and
that
their
professors
will
be
receiving
a
record
of
the
conference.
This
tactic
often
can
make
students
a
little
more
agreeable.
There
have
been
at
least
two
experiences
in
the
past
year
that
have
helped
to
bring
my
WA-work
into
clearer
focus.
The
first
occurred
while
I
was
studying
abroad.
Several
of
my
friends
were
British
and
Australian.
Often
we
would
switch
papers,
and
my
friends
would
mention
how
helpful
my
comments
and
suggestions
were.
I
know
that
this
was
due
to
my
training
and
working
as
a
WA.
My
second
experience
has
been
in
my
preparations
for
applying
to
law
school.
I
have
been
working
on
my
writing
sample
for
the
admissions
exam.
I
feel
that
my
work
as
a
WA
has
helped
me
to
dissect
an
assignment
and
write
an
essay
that
is
clear
and
focused.
I
am
excited
to
be
back
at
Lafayette
for
my
final
year
and
ready
to
start
working
as
a
WA
again.
The
beginning
of
the
year
will
be
busy
with
my
classes,
doing
an
honors
thesis
and
working
as
WA.
I
anticipate
that
the
skills
I
have
developed
as
a
WA
will
help
with
my
thesis
research
and
writing.
As
far
as
working
as
a
WA
is
concerned,
I
am
excited
to
rejoin
the
program
after
being
away
and
look
forward
to
working
with
the
new
WAs.
Hopefully,
I
will
have
a
good
class
and
the
students
will
be
as
excited
to
work
with
me
as
I
am
to
work
with
them.
This
summer
I
have
not
done
that
much
writing,
except
for
this
paper
and
preparing
for
the
LSAT
for
law
school.
The
LSAT
writing
sample
is
a
different
kind
of
writing
than
I
have
ever
done
before.
You
only
have
thirty
five
minutes
to
read
a
prompt,
analyze
it,
plan
and
write
your
essay,
and
then
proofread
it.
This
essay
is
not
scored,
but
instead
is
sent
directly
to
the
law
schools
I
apply
to.
This
essay
in
part
can
determine
which
schools
I
can
get
accepted
into.
This
essay
is
more
stressful
than
most
of
the
writing
I
usually
do.
New
WAs
are
faced
with
many
difficulties
ranging
from
the
students,
professors
and
meeting
the
expectations
set
forth
by
the
writing
program.
The
best
advice
I
can
offer
is
to
have
confidence
in
your
abilities.
When
you
start
doubting
your
abilities
as
a
WA
you
become
ineffective.
It
is
important
to
remember
that
you
were
chosen
as
a
WA
for
a
reason.
Also,
it
is
important
to
discuss
any
difficulties
or
concerns
you
my
have
with
fellow
WAs
and
members
of
the
writing
program
staff.
Professors
can
also
be
helpful
in
helping
to
clear
up
any
problems
with
their
students
or
misunderstandings
over
assignments.
My
history
as
a
writer
has
developed
in
ways
I
could
not
have
predicted
upon
becoming
a
WA.
It
is
important
for
WAs
to
remember
that
the
students
we
meet
with
have
different
writing
histories
than
our
own.
EveryoneOs
history
as
a
writer
affects
their
adjustments
to
college
writing
and
their
willingness
to
receive
help
from
a
WA.
Writing
associates
must
remember
this
and
work
to
make
the
students
comfortable
and
confident
in
their
own
abilities
as
a
writer.
New
WAs
will
have
to
determine
which
techniques
work
for
them
and
they
should
know
that
returning
WAs
are
a
great
resource
which
they
should
take
advantage
of.
As
I
have
developed
as
a
writer
due
to
my
experiences
as
a
WA,
I
am
more
aware
of
my
writing
process
and
the
writing
identity
I
have
created
for
myself.
