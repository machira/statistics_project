Literary
Narrative
Right
from
the
beginning
of
my
first
grade
year
I
noticed
a
great
difference
between
kindergarten
and
first
grade.
I
was
no
longer
considered
one
of
the
"babies"
of
the
school.
Even
so,
it
was
evident
that
I
was
still
a
"little
kid,"
for
the
"big
kids",
the
fifth
and
sixth
graders,
still
loomed
in
the
hallways
and
cafeteria.
It
was
during
this
period
of
my
life
that
I
was
somewhat
convinced
that
I
would
remain
a
"little
kid"
forever
and
that
the
"big
kids"
would
always
be
one
step
ahead
of
me.
While
I
remember
that
thought
to
have
dominated
much
of
my
first
grade
year,
it
was
not
the
only
impressive
occurrence
to
have
happened.
My
first
memorable
writing
experience
came
during
my
first
grade
year,
as
well.
Each
first
grader
was
paired
up
with
a
sixth
grader
and
our
two
classes
met
periodically
throughout
the
week,
allowing
the
pairs
a
chance
to
talk
and
get
to
know
each
other.
From
the
information
we
gathered
and
with
the
help
of
our
teachers,
we
all
wrote
a
short
story
about
our
partner.
We
then
handed
our
stories
into
our
elementary
school
publishing
center
so
that
they
could
be
printed
up
into
little
books.
When
the
books
were
returned
to
us,
we
completed
them
by
coloring
in
pictures
that
went
along
with
the
story.
After
this
process,
which
seemed
to
take
forever,
we
were
reunited
with
our
sixth
grade
partners
and
exchanged
the
books
that
we
had
written
for
each
other.
As
I
read
my
partner's
amazing
story,
complete
with
wonderful
pictures,
and
compared
it
to
my
own,
I
remember
thinking
that
it
was
incredibly
unfair
that
I
had
to
deal
with
being
a
"little
kid"
when
there
were
obviously
better
things
to
be.
What
I
did
not
understand
at
the
time
was
that
the
roles
would
soon
be
reversed
and
I
would
be
the
one
looked
up
to;
and
looked
up
to,
among
other
things,
as
a
good
writer.
During
the
five
years
that
followed
my
first
grade
year,
I
remember
no
real
important
milestones
in
my
life
as
a
writer.
My
grammar
and
manner
of
speaking,
however,
were
constantly
corrected
by
parents
who
found
it
extremely
important
to
have
children
who
knew
how
to
express
themselves
properly.
It
was
this
constant
pressure
from
mentors
at
home,
rather
than
at
school,
that
forced
me
to
learn
how
to
speak
in
a
way
that
was
not
only
considered
proper
English,
but
that
was
also
effective
in
setting
a
tone
and
conveying
emotion.
Ultimately,
it
was
this
verbal
exchange
that
became
my
foundation
for
writing.
Upon
entering
middle
school,
I
was
bored
in
my
English
classes.
I
had
already
been
given
much
grammatical
instruction,
and
the
concepts
of
topic
sentences
and
five
paragraph
papers
were
not
hard
for
me
to
grasp.
I
received
a
great
deal
of
praise
in
seventh
grade,
not
only
for
doing
well
with
the
technical
aspects
of
writing,
but
also
for
having
a
gift
for
expression
through
writing.
During
my
eighth
grade
year,
my
parents
and
I
decided
that
I
should
take
English
classes
at
the
high
school
instead
of
continuing
my
English
education
at
a
level
that
was
below
my
skill.
The
high
school
was
only
a
block
up
the
street
from
the
middle
school
I
attended,
and
so
it
was
easy
for
me
to
fit
ninth
grade
English
into
my
schedule
without
really
disturbing
my
eighth
grade
year.
Attending
ninth
grade
English
at
the
high
school
proved
to
be
a
good
experience,
for
it
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
think
more
independently
about
writing
and
challenged
me
more
than
the
eighth
grade
class
would
have.
Unfortunately,
that
class
was
really
one
of
the
only
ones
that
did
challenge
me
throughout
high
school.
After
having
spent
my
whole
childhood
focusing
on
school
because
my
parents
thought
it
was
incredibly
important,
I
started
to
find
interests
of
my
own.
High
school
opened
my
eyes
to
a
variety
of
other
activities
and
provided
an
environment
through
which
to
explore
them.
While
it
continued
to
remain
an
important
aspect
of
my
life,
my
education
was
no
longer
my
only
top
priority.
As
a
result,
I
did
not
put
as
much
energy
into
the
papers
I
was
writing
for
school
as
I
had
done
in
the
years
that
preceded
high
school.
During
that
same
period
of
time,
however,
I
found
an
interest
in
creative
writing
and
so
the
act
of
writing
remained
an
important
aspect
of
my
life.
Like
many
girls
my
age,
I
started
to
write
poetry
as
a
form
of
expression.
Wanting
to
encourage
me
to
continue
writing,
my
parents
bought
me
a
journal
in
which
I
could
write
my
poetry.
At
the
time,
my
personal
writing
was
very
simple.
I
would
write
poems
in
standard
rhyme
and
rhythm
and
my
journal
entries
would
merely
relate
what
had
happened
that
day.
Yet,
despite
the
fact
that
it
lacked
creativity,
organization,
and
focus,
it
was
this
first
informal
writing
that
became
an
outlet
for
my
emotions
and
ultimately
led
to
my
passion
for
writing.
After
some
time,
though,
the
novelty
of
creative
writing
wore
off
and
like
scholastic
writing,
my
poetry
and
journal
entries
took
a
backseat
to
other
interests.
During
my
junior
and
senior
years
of
high
school,
I
basically
only
wrote
when
I
had
to
for
assignments
or
when
something
eventful
or
emotional
provoked
it.
Looking
back
on
it,
it
is
easy
to
say
that
high
school
should
have
been
the
time
for
me
to
focus
on
my
writing
in
order
to
prepare
myself
for
the
work
I
would
have
to
do
in
college.
Yet,
even
though
I
did
not
take
advantage
of
many
of
the
opportunities
to
better
my
writing
in
high
school,
I
have
not
felt
ill
prepared
for
the
writing
I
have
had
to
do
at
Lafayette.
In
fact,
when
faced
with
my
first
college
writing
assignment,
I
felt
that
I
was
prepared
even
though
the
assignment
was
to
be
written
in
a
particular
format
that
I
had
never
written
in
before.
I
was
confident
in
my
writing
ability
and
felt
that
in
order
to
do
a
good
job,
I
merely
had
to
focus
and
try
to
write
well.
As
it
turns
out,
I
was
right
and
received
an
"A"
on
the
paper.
While
this
grade
pleased
me,
I
realized
that
it
could
not
necessarily
be
considered
evidence
to
me
that
the
writing,
in
and
of
itself,
was
of
good
quality.
It
merely
signified
that
I
was
able
to
produce
the
type
of
paper
that
the
professor
was
looking
for.
Throughout
much
of
my
college
experience,
I
have
felt
that
many
professors
see
a
good,
"A"
quality
paper
as
being
one
that
effectively
combines
the
aspects
of
facts
with
thought
and
analytical
evidence,
whether
it
is
well
written
or
not.
I
feel,
though,
that
my
papers
are
not
good
unless
they
are
well
written,
as
well
as
technically
sound.
Due
to
the
fact
that
I
think
of
"good"
papers
differently
than
many
of
my
professors
have,
I
have
had
to
separate
my
ideas
about
the
quality
of
the
writing
in
my
papers
from
the
grades
I
have
received
for
them.
While
it
has
been
important
to
me
to
do
well
and
get
good
grades
on
my
papers,
it
has
been
even
more
important
to
me
to
know
that
my
writing
itself,
even
more
than
the
paper
in
general,
is
of
good
quality.
So,
when
I
received
the
"A"
on
that
first
paper,
it
did
not
mean
nearly
as
much
to
me
as
the
praise
I
received
from
my
father.
I
knew
that
my
father
would
be
completely
honest
with
me
about
the
quality
of
my
paper
and
receiving
the
honest
admiration
from
such
an
incredibly
intelligent
man,
a
great
writer
himself,
and
an
English
major,
as
well,
let
me
know
that
I
really
did
have
a
skill
for
writing.
It
was
at
that
time,
that
I
truly
began
to
think
of
myself
as
being
a
talented
writer.
Furthermore,
I
began
to
recognize
that
my
writing
could
be
more
than
an
expressionistic
outlet
and
passion,
but
a
practical
success,
as
well.
As
a
result,
I
began
to
put
forth
a
great
deal
of
effort
to
maintain
my
skill
and
even
further
improve
my
writing.
During
the
summer
after
my
freshman
year
at
Lafayette,
I
was
confused
as
to
whether
I
wanted
to
continue
going
to
school
in
Pennsylvania
or
remain
at
home
in
Colorado
and
transfer
to
CU.
Unable
figure
out
which
would
be
the
best
place
for
me
to
continue
my
education,
I
postponed
making
my
decision
and
choose
to
take
a
year
off
from
school.
While
I
no
longer
had
mandatory
writing
assignments,
writing
remained
an
important
part
of
my
life
and
I
wrote
in
my
journal
nearly
every
day.
I
was
inspired
by
the
writing
of
my
friends
and
the
authors
I
was
reading
at
the
time,
and
took
it
upon
myself
to
find
a
style
and
manner
of
expression
that
suited
me.
It
was
an
incredibly
exploratory
phase
for
me,
as
I
played
around
with
vocabulary,
inflection,
tone,
and
flow.
I
would
constantly
write
something,
read
it
again
and
again,
and
then
rewrite
it,
hoping
that
in
the
end
it
would
sound
a
certain
way
and
provoke
a
certain
feeling.
It
became
incredibly
important
to
me
how
my
writing
sounded
and
how
it
flowed.
Eventually,
my
writing
evolved
into
a
style
that
I
am
very
comfortable
writing
in
and
one
that
I
find
myself
pleased
with
when
I
read
the
results.
Looking
back
through
my
journals,
I
can
really
see
how
far
my
personal
writing
has
progressed.
I
can
see
how
my
writing
has
slowly
become
what
it
is
today
and
can
recognize
the
periods
of
my
life
during
which
it
changed,
as
well.
Clearly,
the
most
drastic
changes
occurred
during
the
year
I
took
off
from
school,
when
I
really
focused
on
improving
my
writing.
It
was
during
that
period
of
trial
and
error
that
I
feel
I
really
grew
the
most
as
a
writer.
That
year
helped
not
only
to
change
my
personal
writing
and
my
style
of
expression,
but
also
my
scholastic
writing
and
the
way
in
which
I
went
about
writing
any
given
piece.
While
I
am
currently
pleased
and
comfortable
with
my
writing
at
this
time,
I
am
looking
forward
to
further
change
and
see
the
Writing
Associate
Program
as
an
opportunity
to
further
focus
on
improving
my
writing.
I
understand
that
there
is
much
more
I
can
learn
about
writing,
not
only
through
formal
education,
but
through
reading
the
works
of
others,
as
well.
Having
not
taken
many
of
the
opportunities
in
the
past
to
learn
from
other
writers
and
grow
in
this
manner,
I
see
the
Writing
Associate
Program
as
a
means
to
help
improve
my
writing
as
well
as
that
of
others.
