WA
Literacy
Narrative
When
I
read
the
prompt
for
this
assignment,
two
images
popped
into
my
head
in
such
quick
succession
that
I
wondered
where
exactly
they
came
from.
My
first
attempts
at
writing
were,
quite
simply
(and
obviously),
trying
to
learn
how
to
write,
and
so
I
guess
that
this
specific
memory
must
have
been
from
preschool.
I
remember
sitting
at
home
in
my
room
while
my
brothers
played
a
rather
violent
game
in
which
they
tried
to
trap
a
stray
cat
in
a
milk
crate
they
had
suspended
from
one
of
the
branches
of
the
oak
tree
in
our
front
yard.
While
they
spent
all
of
their
attention
and
their
energy
on
this
game,
I
sat
inside
with
a
thick,
floppy
book
that
was
filled
with
nothing
but
dotted
lines
and
the
outlines
of
letters
that
I
would
trace
again
and
again
until
I
could
finally
draw
them
on
my
own.
The
last
pages
of
the
book
were
filled
with
words
and
some
sentences,
that
were
meant
to
be
copied
to
finally
put
use
to
all
of
those
meticulously
learned
letters.
Copy
them
I
did,
though
understand
them
I
did
not,
so
this
early
venture
can
hardly
be
considered
writing.
The
second
memory
is
a
rather
ongoing
one,
so
time-wise
it
is
hard
to
place,
although
I
know
it
could
not
have
been
any
time
after
first
grade.
My
parents
had
owned
two
typewriters
before
they
bought
a
computer;
as
soon
as
the
computer
was
moved
into
the
house,
the
two
typewriters
were
demoted
to
dustier
corners
of
the
basement.
I
quickly
started
to
spend
long
periods
of
time
banging
away
industriously
at
the
buttons
of
these
typewriters,
reveling
in
the
long
scrolls
of
paper
that
came
unraveling
out
of
the
upper
end
of
the
machine.
Although
this
example
can
be
considered
writing
about
as
much
as
my
first
example,
the
slightly
more
demanding
portion
of
this
exercise
came
when
my
mom
and
I
would
sit
down
together
and
scan
all
of
these
pages,
circling
in
red
ink
any
words
I
might
have
accidentally
formed.
After
this
exercise,
we
would
rewrite
all
of
the
successfully
formed
words
on
another
page
in
the
exact
(if
random)
order
I
had
initially
written
them,
forming
little
poems
of
varying
logic.
I
canOt
remember
any
of
the
NpoemsO
we
wrote,
but
I
suppose
this
can
still
be
considered
my
first
experiment
with
poetry.
I
think
that
what
may
be
most
unique
about
me
as
a
writer
is
that
I
learned
how
to
write
simultaneously
in
two
languages:
English
and
Latvian.
The
language
I
spoke
first
was
Latvian,
as
that
was
(and
still
is)
the
language
my
family
and
I
speak
at
home.
I
attended
fourteen
years
of
Latvian
school,
held
every
Saturday
of
every
school
year,
and
three
summers
of
Latvian
Summer
High
School
in
Michigan.
In
both
of
these
we
were
asked
to
complete
regular
homework
assignments
that
all
involved
reading
classical
Latvian
literature,
responding
to
our
readings,
and
also
generating
our
own
creative
responses
to
prompts
assigned
by
our
teachers.
In
this
way,
I
was
exposed
to
not
only
the
writing
styles
of
an
entirely
different
culture,
but
also
to
the
intricacies
of
two
very
different
languages.
These
differences
are
something
that
have
stayed
with
me,
both
consciously
and
subconsciously,
as
I
have
continued
writing
in
both
languages.
My
English
vocabulary
is
now
the
more
extensive
one,
and
the
one
that
I
use
more
frequently,
both
orally
and
through
writing.
I
therefore
feel
more
comfortable
exploring
different
writing
genres
and
styles
in
English.
The
more
interesting
language,
however,
I
think
is
Latvian,
which
can
alternate
between
being
marvelously
simple
and
aggravatingly
complex.
Specifically,
I
have
come
to
appreciate
the
fact
that
poetically
unnecessary
words,
such
as
pronouns,
are
also
grammatically
unnecessary
because
of
the
declensions
on
verbs
and
nouns.
As
a
language,
I
think
that
it
has
a
poetic
quality
that
is
inherent,
sometimes
accidental.
Short
phrases
are
done
all
the
more
striking
because
the
only
words
included
in
them
are
there
solely
for
meaning,
rather
than
by
grammatical
necessity.
This
knowledge,
and
the
comparison
of
the
two
languages,
is
something
that
affects
my
writing
in
both
languages.
I
was
exposed
to
creative
writing
forms
very
early
on,
when,
in
second
grade,
my
teacher,
who
was
often
accused
of
straying
too
far
off
the
beaten
path,
would
replace
ordinary
homework
assignments
(such
as
math
worksheets)
with
free-writing
assignments.
Although
this
is
a
choice
that
has
undoubtedly
been
detrimental
to
me
in
the
field
of
mathematics,
I
have
benefited
from
it
from
it
in
the
comfort
I
feel,
and
always
have
felt,
in
expressing
myself
through
writing.
Even
in
second
grade,
I
never
put
up
an
argument
against
or
tried
to
maneuver
my
way
out
of
writing
assignments.
I
canOt
specify,
just
because
I
donOt
remember,
if
I
enjoyed
them
or
not,
but
I
can
assertively
say
that
I
never
tried
to
avoid
them.
I
have
always
been
the
type
of
person
to
pursue
any
sort
of
assignment
until
it
was
completed
to
the
best
of
my
abilities,
and
this
trait
is
something
that
was
almost
always
rewarded
by
the
feedback
I
received
from
teachers,
and,
most
importantly,
my
mom.
I
donOt
know
if
my
momOs
support
of
my
writing
has
been
directly
or
loosely
tied
to
the
critiques
I
have
received
from
teachers,
but
I
do
know
that
she
has
been
an
incredible
constant
in
urging
me
to
keep
writing
and
to
keep
pursuing
new
ways
of
expressing
myself.
Pretty
much
every
creative
writing
class
I
have
taken,
I
have
taken
upon
her
insistence.
But,
because
she
has
been
nothing
but
supportive,
I
have
always
felt
nervous
showing
her
my
work
D
or
showing
it
to
anyone,
for
that
matter.
One
of
my
biggest
challenges
through
high
school
and
even
now
is
opening
up
and
showing
my
poems
and/or
short
stories
to
others:
I
remember
literally
shaking
in
my
seat
the
first
time
I
had
to
read
one
of
my
own
poems
aloud
in
high
school.
With
time,
I
have
come
to
realize
that
these
nerves
and
that
sense
of
apprehension
are
something
that
I
will
probably
always
have,
but
that
they
are
just
something
I
will
have
to
work
around;
and
I
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
working
around
them
has
resulted
in
more
positives
than
negatives,
such
as
in
increased
confidence
in
myself,
and
the
small
array
of
awards
I
won
for
my
poetry
in
high
school.
Looking
back
to
all
my
years
in
high
school
and
middle
school,
I
canOt
remember
an
instance
in
which
I
ever
received
a
strongly
negative
comment
to
my
writing,
either
as
a
written
comment
or
as
a
letter
grade.
I
rarely,
until
the
second
half
of
my
high
school
years,
attributed
this
to
some
sort
of
talent.
The
way
I
saw
(and
still,
to
some
extent
do
see)
it
was
that
I
always
put
in
a
large
effort
into
writing
and
editing
my
papers,
and
so
why
should
my
grades
reflect
anything
particularly
lower
than
the
amount
of
work
I
put
into
them?
As
my
classes
became
more
demanding
and
a
higher
caliber
of
work
was
expected
from
my
peers
and
me,
I
started
to
realize
that
this
explanation,
however,
was
insufficient.
I
specifically
remember
my
high
school
senior
year
AP
English
class,
which
I
took
with
five
of
my
best
friends.
This
class,
to
this
day,
remains
one
of
the
most
reading-intensive
classes
I
have
ever
taken:
in
the
fall
half
of
the
year,
we
absolutely
blew
through
novels.
My
friends
and
I
all
remained
in
similar
standing
in
the
class,
averaging
somewhere
in
the
high-B,
low-A
range.
The
spring
portion
of
the
class,
however,
moved
off
from
reading,
and
into
a
writing
concentration.
Every
week
we
were
assigned
a
different
writing
genre
that
we
would
examine
in
detail,
reading
and
critiquing
examples
of
such
writing.
These
styles
ranged
from
simple
narrations
and
memoirs,
to
persuasive
and
opinion
papers,
and
even
into
areas
like
farces.
At
the
end
of
each
week,
we
had
a
paper
due,
in
which
we
had
to
demonstrate
that
we
could
now
effectively
write
in
this
style.
The
true
test
of
our
abilities
came
at
the
end
of
the
year,
when
we
were
assigned
a
huge
research
paper,
and
the
daunting,
unparalleled
assignment
of
writing
a
ten-page
short
story.
The
research
paper
came
with
plenty
of
regulations
and
requirements,
the
short
story,
with
none.
IOm
sure
the
writing
processes
of
both
of
these
papers
varied
for
all
six
of
my
friends
and
me,
but
in
the
end,
we
were
all
simply
amazed
to
see
the
uniquely
high
grade
that
I
came
out
of
the
class
with.
Undoubtedly,
we
had
all
put
time
and
effort
into
these
assignments,
but
when
I
came
out
with
the
lone
NAO
of
the
class,
I
found
myself
as
surprised
as
everyone
else
in
the
class.
It
was
around
this
time
that
I
finally
started
thinking
that
maybe
mixed
into
the
effort
that
I
willingly
put
into
my
work
was
a
little
bit
of
something
else,
something
that
would
set
me
apart
from
the
other
grade-hungry
students
in
my
English
classes.
Leaving
high
school
and
entering
college,
I
do
think
that
I
felt
sufficiently
prepared
in
terms
of
my
writing
abilities.
I
had
always
had
some
sort
of
desire
to
write,
and
now,
particularly
after
that
AP
English
class,
I
had
seen
various
sorts
of
writing
and
felt
at
least
some
confidence
in
my
abilities.
Receiving
my
first
writing
assignment
in
college
was
still
a
bit
of
a
shock,
simply
because
so
much
more
was
required
in
such
a
shorter
time
span
than
would
have
been
in
high
school.
After
sitting
down
and
digesting
the
assignment,
that
initial
shock
subsided
into
a
combination
of
the
excitement
and
sense
of
order
that
I
usually
feel
when
I
am
writing
a
paper;
I
would
say
that
my
transition
from
high
school
to
college
was
rather
smooth,
on
the
whole.
Having
taken
two
years
of
Creative
Writing
in
high
school,
I
decided
to
follow
up
on
these
by
taking
a
Creative
Writing
course
at
Lafayette
this
past
semester.
This,
I
think,
has
been
my
best
academic
decision
so
far
in
college.
In
a
matter
of
months
I
was
exposed
to
more
styles
and
information
than
I
was
in
all
of
high
school,
and
loved
not
only
the
information,
but
also
the
way
in
which
it
was
presented
to
me.
My
attitude
towards
homework
assignments
was
almost
like
one
of
hunger:
I
couldnOt
wait
to
complete
them
when
they
were
assigned,
and
often
continued
expanding
on
them
in
additional
poems
or
story
fragments.
In
this
Creative
Writing
course
I
was,
for
the
second
time,
assigned
to
write
a
ten-page
short
story.
Writing
this,
and
seeing
other
peopleOs
reaction
to
it,
has
been
one
of
my
most
rewarding
experiences
as
a
writer.
The
story
I
wrote
was
a
vague,
disturbing
story
about
an
old
man
reflecting
on
a
traumatizing
event
in
his
past,
the
ghosts
of
which
have
remained
with
him
year
after
year.
Only
a
couple
of
people
in
the
class
actually
understood
what
I
was
hinting
around,
and
their
responses
to
my
short
story
were
very
generous
in
their
praise.
The
majority
of
the
class,
however,
was
befuddled
by
the
mix
of
images
I
presented
in
the
story,
and
the
chronologically
altered
order
in
which
I
placed
them.
When
I
paired
their
confusion,
with
those
other
studentsO
comprehension,
I
felt
almost
proud
at
having
been
able
to
create
something
that
was
confusing,
challenging,
and
probably
surprising,
without
being
so
vague
or
exclusive
that
it
lost
every
reader
along
the
way.
Increasingly,
free-writing
has
become
an
outlet
for
me,
in
which
I
can
free
myself
of
whatever
may
be
on
my
mind.
I
have
a
journal
in
my
room
that
I
started
writing
in
years
ago.
Sporadically
I
pick
it
up
to
write
it
in,
sometimes
merely
when
I
am
bored
on
a
long
road
trip,
at
other
times
when
I
have
something
too
personal
on
my
mind
for
spoken
words,
such
as
my
mix
of
emotions
after
the
death
of
a
friend
this
summer.
I
enjoy
reading
my
earlier
entries
from
time
to
time,
partially
to
see
how
much
worse
a
writer
I
was
back
in
2006,
but
am
finally
approaching
the
final
pages
of
this
long-lived
notebook.
My
mom
has
ensured
that
a
large,
empty
stack
of
colorful
notebooks
sits
on
my
dresser
at
home,
waiting
(some
have
been
waiting
for
quite
a
while
now,
and
probably
will
still
have
to)
to
be
filled.
I
would
like
to
quickly
touch
back
on
a
comment
I
made
earlier
about
having
received
predominantly
positive
feedback.
I
think
that
because
negative
feedback
has
been
limited,
those
comments
that
I
have
received
have
been
particularly
influential.
This
past
year
I
was
handed
back
a
paper
I
had
written
for
my
300-level
English
class,
and
flipped
immediately
to
the
last
page,
where,
as
was
customary
for
this
professor,
was
a
critique
page.
At
the
top
of
the
page
was
my
letter
grade,
followed
by
some
brief
paragraphs
highlighting
what
I
had
done
well.
At
the
very
bottom
of
the
page
was
a
single
sentence:
Nyou
seem
to
have
recently
fallen
in
love
with
the
semicolon.O
This
brief
comment
alone
influenced
me
more
than
all
the
positive
feedback
piled
up
on
top
of
it,
and
has
literally
been
on
my
mind
as
I
have
written
each
and
every
paper
since
then.
I
hope
that
I
have
not
abused
my
semi-colon
privilege
too
harshly
in
this
paper.
