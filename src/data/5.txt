August

1995
My
earliest
memories
of
writing
stem
from
Mrs.
Borgel's
third
grade
science
class.
I
was
assigned
the
task
of
watching
a
living
organism
for
the
school
year
and
then
writing
about
the
changes
that
occurred
to
this
living
material.
I
decided
I
would
describe
a
tree
located
outside
of
my
house
to
observe
the
effects
of
the
seasons.
Coming
from
Boston,
I
had
the
pleasure
of
watching
the
yearly
explosion
of
colors
as
the
leaves
painted
the
seasons.
I
watched
my
tree
turn
a
gorgeous
shade
of
gold,
then
brown.
The
leaves
fell
off,
branches
collapsed
under
snow,
and
then
the
buds
of
spring
blossomed
green
leaves
with
the
coming
of
spring
and
summer.
Today,
it
seems
easy
enough
to
explain
the
processes
the
tree
underwent;
however,
I
can
clearly
recall
staring
at
my
polaroid
shots
which
documented
the
changing
seasons
and
having
absolutely
nothing
to
write.
I
was
in
third
grade;
I
had
the
joy
of
snapping
polaroids,
of
watching
the
tree,
and
now
they
(the
school)
expected
me
to
write
about
these
events.
I
stared,
and
thought,
but
nothing
came
to
me.
Under
the
mounting
pressure
of
the
approaching
deadline
I
blurted
out
some
pathetic
discussion
of
the
seasons
in
a
very
rough
cursive.
I
am
not
even
sure
what
I
received
as
a
grade;
the
important
point
was
that
I
felt
I
had
nothing
to
write.
I
had
assumed,
being
that
I
was
only
in
third
grade,
that
as
long
as
I
had
research
materials
(the
polaroids),
the
writing
part
would
take
care
of
itself.
In
fifth
grade
I
was
introduced
to
creative
writing
in
Mrs.
Kelley's
class.
Mrs.
Kelley
was
not
a
teacher
who
captured
the
kindred
spirits
of
her
students,
she
preferred
to
assign
work
and
sit
behind
her
desk
to
read
magazines.
However,
Mrs.
Kelley,
unexpectedly
managed
to
light
some
imagination
inside
of
me
through
her
assignments.
Each
month
Mrs.
Kelley
gave
the
class
a
calendar.
The
space
allotted
for
each
day
on
the
calendar
contained
an
unfinished
sentence.
The
student
was
to
complete
the
sentence
and
the
cumulative
effort
was
towards
developing
a
story.
The
stories
were
written
into
each
student's
daily
journal.
We
had
thirty
minutes
to
write
our
stories
and
each
day
students
were
called
upon
to
read
their
stories
aloud.
The
experience
of
writing
in
a
daily
journal
was
extremely
helpful
to
me.
Instead
of
waiting
for
the
writing
to
come
into
my
head,
I
started
writing
anything
I
thought
about,
even
if
it
was
silly.
I
wrote
stories
about
strange
worlds
and
unusual
perspectives
that
were
created
in
my
budding
imagination.
Such
creations
included
a
day
in
the
life
of
my
pencil
and
why
mothers
did
not
know
how
to
count
past
the
number
three.
The
best
part
of
the
exercise
was
reading
our
stories
aloud.
My
stories
never
got
much
applause,
but
I
learned
that
people
had
very
different
styles
of
writing.
I
discovered
how
strongly
a
persons
voice
comes
through
in
their
writing.
It
is
interesting
to
realize
I
was
learning
from
my
classmates
even
in
the
fifth
grade.
Perhaps
Mrs.
Kelley
was
a
better
teacher
than
I
had
previously
thought.
Abigail
crossed
the
street
marked
by
her
quick
step
and
grace.
To
the
average
observer
she
appeared
quite
plain;
no
shocking
discomformities
were
to
be
found
but
no
marks
of
beauty
could
be
easily
uncovered.
She
was
a
woman
of
contradictions
--
so
frail
and
yet
so
strong.
The
story
of
Abigail
is
an
excerpt
from
my
writings
between
middle
school
and
the
beginning
of
high
school.
After
reading
Tess
of
the
D'Urbervilles.
I
became
a
Thomas
Hardy
disciple.
Writing
became
a
game,
a
way
for
me
to
see
just
how
descriptive
my
style
could
become.
I
had
become
more
interested
in
describing
than
in
forming
a
plot
-
even
today
I
do
not
know
Abigail's
story.
This
form
of
writing
lead
me
into
writing
poetry.
I
used
the
heavy
emphasis
on
descriptive
voice
to
write
numerous
poems.
I
kept
a
journal
throughout
high
school
in
which
I
stored
all
of
my
stories
and
poems.
My
best
friend,
Sandra,
had
read
some
of
my
poems
and
thought
that
they
were
pretty
good.
One
day
I
found
a
bound
journal
on
my
desk
from
my
friend,
Sandra.
The
inscription
inside
wished
me
the
best
of
luck
and
claimed
dibs
on
the
first
copy
of
my
published
poems.
It
was
one
of
the
best
gifts
I
had
ever
received
because
it
allowed
me
to
watch
the
evolution
of
my
writing.
As
I
look
through
the
journal
I
see
a
period
of
writing
marked
by
half
finished
stories
and
strange
poetry.
Rereading
what
I
had
written
gave
me
a
sense
of
not
only
the
writer
that
I
was
but
the
kind
of
person
I
had
been.
In
high
school
I
faced
the
new
challenge
of
term
papers
by
cultivating
my
procrastination
skills.
I
hated
writing
research
papers.
I
would
feel
myself
traveling
back
in
time
to
the
third
grade;
staring
at
polaroids
of
a
tree
and
having
no
idea
what
to
write.
The
difference
is
that
this
time
the
seasons
were
not
challenging
me
to
observe
and
describe.
I
was
forced
to
write
on
subjects
such
as
the
Battle
of
Midway.
In
writing
on
the
Battle
of
Midway,
I
found
myself
staring
at
books
and
trying
to
combine
my
ideas
with
those
of
historians.
My
writing
was
far
from
smooth,
but
it
succeeded
in
helping
me
attain
acceptable
grades.
In
fact,
I
though
my
writing
was
pretty
good.
College
helped
to
change
that
view
of
myself.
English
101
at
Lafayette
College
taught
me
that
I
had
no
idea
how
to
write
sensibly,
let
alone
interestingly.
I
was
not
accustomed
to
the
amount
of
work
assigned
-
weekly
papers,
journals,
and
peer
editing.
Peer
editing
was
the
worst
experience
for
the
type
of
writing
I
was
accustomed
to
in
high
school.
I
seldom
rewrote
my
papers.
Rewriting
was
to
become
a
much
needed
addition
to
my
writing
process
due
to
the
Lafayette
writing
experience.
I
not
only
wrote
many
drafts
of
my
own
papers,
but
proof
read
for
other
students.
As
my
classes
advanced,
I
discovered
how
to
write
drafts
in
advance,
study
structure,
create
smooth
transitions,
and
even
work
with
or
against
reader
expectations.
My
views
on
writing
had
evolved
from
merely
trying
to
get
the
assignment
finished
to
working
on
an
interesting
piece
of
writing.
My
history
of
writing
has
evolved
from
an
experience
I
despised
to
one
I
truly
enjoy.
This
interest
lead
me
to
an
internship
with
my
community
newspaper
during
the
past
summer
in
order
to
explore
the
field
of
journalism.
As
with
previous
writing
experiences,
this
internship
further
changed
my
view
of
writing.
Writing
for
a
newspaper
incorporates
a
completely
different
approach
to
the
writing
process.
My
first
big
assignment
at
the
newspaper
was
to
write
the
article
titled
Melrose
Memories.
This
article
is
a
look
back
on
the
activities
that
happened
throughout
the
city
of
Melrose
75,
50,
and
25
years
ago.
To
write
these
articles
you
must
do
the
research
by
reviewing
past
issues
of
the
Melrose
Free
Press
(the
paper
I
interned
for),
at
the
public
library
microfilm
machine.
Mastering
the
microfilm
machine
was
half
the
battle
in
this
job.
Once
I
learned
how
to
browse
through
the
papers
I
faced
the
problem
of
deciding
what
would
interest
people.
There
were
so
many
interesting
topics
to
touch
on
that
I
did
not
even
know
where
to
begin.
I
was
reading
about
women's
right
to
vote,
the
Grange
club
of
Melrose,
then
the
war
years
filled
with
heroes
and
death,
and
a
final
jump
in
history
to
sit-ins,
love-ins,
and
the
drug
mobiles
of
the
1970's.
It
was
amazing
to
see
how
history
had
effected
the
manner
in
which
people
wrote.
I
saw
changes
in
journalism
from
the
style
of
writing
to
the
very
structure
and
lay
out
of
the
paper
itself.
I
managed
to
write
the
history
article;
more
importantly,
I
saw
how
writing
as
a
continuous
state
of
change.
There
exists
no
absolute
correct
manner
in
which
to
write
because
the
process
itself
is
in
a
constant
state
of
flux
reflecting
the
views
of
the
age
and
the
author.
Another
article
I
had
to
write
was
on
Keirsten
Alley,
an
amazing
athlete
from
Melrose
who
is
entering
the
women's
professional
tennis
touring
circuit
after
she
graduates
form
Berkeley.
I
was
handed
a
six
page
document
from
Alley's
mother
containing
everything
the
athlete
had
ever
accomplished.
I
was
told
to
use
the
information
and
write
an
article.
Memories
of
Mrs.
Borgel
and
the
tree
came
rushing
back
as
I
sat
with
the
information
with
no
idea
what
to
write.
The
information
was
great,
but
this
was
a
feature
story.
I
had
to
make
this
athlete
look
interesting
even
though
I
had
never
spoken
to
her.
Writing
the
article
became
a
game.
I
worked
to
place
all
the
pieces
of
this
amazing
career
into
something
people
would
want
to
read.
The
article
turned
out
to
be
very
interesting
because
I
used
the
structure
of
the
article
to
create
a
feature
story
of
interest.
This
internship
opened
my
eyes
to
the
different
styles
and
methods
of
writing
for
your
audience.
The
need
to
grab
people's
attention
with
a
good
lead
and
then
write
an
article
is
overwhelming.
The
writer
also
has
to
decide
the
approach
they
are
taking
to
the
story
and
form
a
strategy
based
on
this
approach.
Is
this
a
feature,
a
human
interest
piece,
or
a
hard
core
report?
Once
the
writer
has
chosen
the
approach
they
know
how
creative
they
can
be
and
the
structure
necessary
for
the
appropriate
article.
The
internship
proved
to
be
extremely
helpful
in
expanding
and
refining
my
view
of
writing
and
my
approach
to
writing.
Learning
to
enjoy
writing
and
seeing
improvements
in
my
writing
lead
me
to
apply
for
a
Writing
Associate
position.
I
decided
I
could
learn
even
more
about
writing,
including
my
own,
by
working
with
other
students.
I
hope
that
this
history
of
my
experiences
proves
to
be
as
helpful
to
others,
as
it
has
been
for
me.
