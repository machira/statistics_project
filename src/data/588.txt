WA
Summer
Assignment
As
I
sit
and
reflect
on
how
my
writing
has
changed
since
I
was
first
given
the
coveted
position
as
writing
associate,
I
realize
that
I
possess
a
talent
that
is
beneficial
both
to
me
and
to
the
student
writers
who
seek
my
advice.
In
writing,
I
am
able
to
flip
between
many
different
forms,
weave
my
words
through
several
styles,
and
change
my
tone
depending
on
the
audience
and
assignment.
My
father
has
always
called
me
a
chameleon
in
my
speech,
chuckling
at
the
way
I
seem
to
take
on
specific
vocabulary
and
even
the
inflection
and
intonation
of
the
person
to
whom
I
am
speaking,
so
it
makes
sense
that
this
characteristic
would
also
be
evident
in
my
writing.
Looking
over
my
writing
from
last
year,
I
smile
to
realize
that
I
have
learned
to
mimic
certain
authors
and
their
styles
and
can
even
attribute
my
sentence
structure
in
certain
pieces
to
have
been
influenced
by
the
author
who
I
happened
to
be
reading
at
the
time.
With
this
mix
of
variability
of
style
and
alteration
of
tone,
I
feel
I
have
achieved
what
my
educators
for
fifteen
years
have
hoped
for
D
not
a
student
who
excels
at
a
singular
type
of
writing,
but
rather
a
well
rounded
writer
who
can
handle
even
the
most
exacting
of
assignments.
It
is
not
for
nothing,
after
all,
that
my
elementary
school
teachers
insisted
the
class
complete
retellings
of
pieces
we
had
read,
that
my
middle
school
English
teachers
trained
us
on
the
difference
between
a
narrative
and
informative
essay,
and
that
my
high
school
professors
stressed
the
importance
of
the
three
types
of
essays
required
for
the
PSSA
Writing
tests.
Some
may
point
out
this
variability
as
inconsistency
and
immaturity
in
a
writer,
but
I
believe
the
exact
opposite
D
the
ability
to
write
in
several
styles
yet
still
maintain
my
individual
voice
throughout
shows
my
development
and
maturity
in
writing.
Just
as
we
applaud
actors
who
perform
equally
well
in
both
comedies
and
dramas,
and
Olympic
gymnasts
who
wow
us
with
their
floor
exercises
but
are
even
more
amazing
on
vault,
so
we
too
should
applaud
writers
who
can
transition
between
several
styles
with
ease
and
confidence.
Considering
this,
I
would
not
say
that
this
ability
came
about
only
over
this
past
year.
Theses
skills
are
a
culmination
of
many
years
of
writing,
hundreds
of
words
both
hand-written
and
typed,
and
the
work
and
dedication
of
many
teachers.
With
each
passing
year
I
learned
a
little
more,
and
came
to
realize
which
types
of
writing
I
preferred.
And
while
I
griped
about
writing
assignments
that
forced
me
to
be
creative
rather
than
analytical,
these
were
all
tools
in
helping
me
grow
to
become
the
writer
I
am
today.
Now
I
understand
that
although
there
are
certain
styles
in
which
I
would
prefer
to
write,
I
have
come
far
enough
in
my
career
as
a
writer
to
be
able
to
take
any
assignment
and
run
with
it,
even
if
the
requested
style
is
not
my
favorite.
This
discovery
came
to
me
on
my
own
efforts
in
writing,
and
not
through
a
series
of
assignments
given
by
teachers
to
see
which
style
I
was
best
in.
As
a
science
major,
my
junior
year
was
inundated
with
science
courses
and
labs,
very
few
of
which
required
any
written
aspect
other
than
coherent
responses
to
short
answer
exam
questions.
I
therefore
discovered
my
talent
outside
of
class.
I
studied
scientific
writing
in
two
separate
internships,
both
of
which
required
me
to
read
many
scientific
journals
and
reviews.
My
own
scientific
writing
abilities
were
tested
in
these
internships
as
I
crafted
abstracts
and
sweated
over
proposals.
I
became
more
comfortable
with
talking
about
myself
after
completing
countless
cover
letters
and
personal
statements
for
internships
and
jobs.
I
tried
my
hand
at
character
studies
and
learned
that
creative
writing
can
be
fulfilling
and
even
fun
by
studying
others
around
me
and
putting
their
lives
into
words.
And
I
discovered
a
new
side
to
my
writing
by
keeping
a
journal
while
abroad
in
which
every
day
I
was
free
to
write
my
experiences,
thoughts,
and
feelings
in
whatever
style
and
with
whatever
tone
compelled
me.
Despite
the
fact
that
I
became
more
aware
of
myself
as
a
writer
since
last
summer,
I
would
have
to
say
that
my
writing
has
not
changed
much
over
the
last
year.
With
personal
writing
I
have
explored
new
topics
and
feelings,
but
I
believe
that
my
own
voice
still
rings
through,
and
that
this
voice,
in
fact,
is
not
much
different
than
the
voice
that
I
was
complemented
on
by
a
teacher
in
my
first
formal
research
paper
in
fifth
grade.
In
my
defense,
I
have
not
had
many
writing
assignments
this
year
D
while
abroad
for
almost
five
months,
I
was
only
given
one
research
paper
(written
for
my
organic
chemistry
class
and
therefore
strictly
scientific)
and
a
few
response
papers
for
my
Spanish
Art
History
class.
Last
fall
I
took
Literary
Questions,
in
which
there
were
short
writing
assignments
every
week,
but
these
were
all
analytical
essays,
the
type
I
feel
to
be
somewhat
of
my
specialty.
Since
becoming
a
Writing
Associate,
the
biggest
changes
in
my
writing
are
not
actually
what
I
put
down
on
paper
but
how
I
read
other
peoples
work.
And
one
of
the
most
difficult
things
that
I
have
tried
to
do
as
a
WA
is
show
the
student
writers
what
I
have
learned
D
that
they
are
able
to
write
in
any
style
that
is
asked
of
them.
I
see
now
that
the
ability
to
write
in
several
styles
is
essential
in
a
writing
associate,
especially
for
drop
in
hours,
when
you
might
read
a
mechanical
engineering
paper,
a
history
essay
and
a
psychology
study
all
in
the
span
of
two
hours.
The
challenge
was
trying
to
get
the
students
to
see
that
they
are
capable
of
writing
in
many
styles.
Several
times,
I
have
had
science
or
engineering
majors
come
in
and
tell
me
that
they
have
to
write
about
a
book
for
their
College
Writing
course
and
were
having
an
extremely
hard
time.
As
I
talked
to
the
student
writers,
and
tried
to
help
them
develop
their
ideas
and
translate
them
from
scientific
thoughts
to
an
essay
for
an
English
class,
I
was
seeing
my
own
skills
come
out,
and
remembering
my
own
challenges.
The
part
of
being
a
WA
that
really
taught
me
the
most
about
my
own
writing
was
working
with
the
student
writers
in
my
assigned
course.
I
worked
with
sixteen
students
in
a
FYS
course
titled
NFearO.
I
feel
that
after
working
with
these
students
for
four
months
and
meeting
with
each
of
them
at
least
four
times,
I
came
to
know
them
all
very
well
as
writers
and
was
proud
to
see
improvements
from
the
first
papers
to
the
last.
But
these
students
taught
me
as
much
as
I
taught
them.
Before
becoming
a
writing
associate,
I
never
imagined
that
there
could
be
so
many
different
ways
to
approach
a
paper.
Yes,
I
understood
that
there
were
many
different
types
of
writing,
but
I
incorrectly
assumed
that
most
students
given
the
same
assignment
would
look
at
the
problem
in
similar
ways,
and
in
the
same
way
that
I
did.
Instead,
I
found
myself
going
over
prompts
with
each
student,
and
hearing
their
different
takes
on
how
they
would
go
about
the
assignment.
And
with
sixteen
students,
I
was
presented
with
sixteen
different
ways
of
looking
at
writing.
Even
though
I
was
not
going
to
be
writing
my
own
paper
for
their
assignment,
I
found
myself
preparing
opening
paragraphs
in
my
head,
thinking
about
arguments
and
angles
and
coming
up
with
additional
ideas
for
students
that
had
already
presented
me
with
their
paper.
This
was
a
challenge
in
itself,
and
something
that
was
brought
up
many
times
at
WA
staff
meetings.
I
needed
to
say
the
right
things
to
allow
the
student
writers
to
see
their
mistakes
and
correct
them
themselves,
when
it
would
have
been
far
easier
for
the
WA
to
pick
up
the
pencil
and
rework
the
sentence
for
the
student
writer.
Reading
over
studentOs
papers
to
prepare
for
their
meetings,
I
had
to
resist
the
temptation
to
change
sentences
and
phrases
to
Nthe
way
I
would
say
it.O
Helping
the
students
find
their
own
voice
was
my
job,
and
I
had
to
constantly
remind
myself
not
to
let
my
voice
get
in
the
way
of
the
student
writers.
Even
more
challenging
was
when
a
student
said
to
me
NWell
how
would
you
say
this?O
I
knew
how
I
would
say
what
the
student
was
trying
to
explain
in
my
own
writing,
but
my
position
as
the
writing
associate
was
to
help
find
a
way
to
say
it
in
her
own
voice.
Instead
of
giving
into
temptation
and
writing
a
new
sentence
for
her,
I
asked
her
to
explain
the
idea
to
me
again,
in
her
own
words.
We
eventually
found
a
good
way
to
word
the
sentence,
and
I
learned
that
although
I
had
developed
my
voice
before
my
first
year
of
college,
for
some
students
this
takes
a
bit
longer.
This
made
me
appreciate
my
own
writing,
and
as
I
watched
students
struggling
to
create
their
voice,
I
was
in
the
process
of
refining
mine
as
I
now
reread
my
own
work
as
I
would
read
the
work
of
a
student
writer.
Research
papers
were
another
topic
that
I
commonly
encountered
as
a
writing
associate.
While
many
students
claim
that
research
papers
are
the
worst
type
of
assignment
possible,
I
always
found
them
to
be
kind
of
fun,
taking
pleasure
in
exploring
a
subject
to
a
depth
where
when
I
had
my
polished
paper,
I
really
discovered
something
new
about
the
subject
and
was
happy
to
present
it
to
my
audience.
Of
course,
I
can
see
where
some
might
disagree
with
me,
and
rightfully
so,
because
writing
a
good
research
paper
takes
a
lot
of
work.
But
helping
my
student
writers
with
their
final
research
paper
was
fun
and
interesting
to
me.
Not
only
did
I
learn
about
many
new
subjects,
but
it
was
in
these
papers
that
I
felt
I
helped
the
students
the
most.
Like
myself,
some
of
the
student
writers
that
I
worked
with
had
found
so
much
information
that
they
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
all.
I
found
myself
asking
them
to
make
outlines
of
what
they
wanted
to
say
(something
I
would
have
personally
rarely
done
myself).
Having
a
streamlined
order
in
which
to
work
off
of,
the
students
were
then
able
to
work
in
all
the
relevant
facts
and
write
a
focused
paper.
Each
time
I
had
a
student
do
this,
I
realized
I
was
giving
advice
that
I,
myself,
had
been
given,
but
usually
did
not
take.
Sure
enough,
at
the
end
of
the
semester,
I
was
assigned
a
research
paper,
one
in
which
I
had
a
lot
of
information
but
also
a
page
limit,
and
in
which
I
took
my
own
advice
and
created
an
outline.
I
also
used
the
outline
technique
to
help
student
writers
who
were
having
trouble
staying
on
topic
and
sticking
to
their
thesis.
After
speaking
with
a
mentor
WA,
we
came
up
with
a
technique
similar
to
backward
outlining.
The
student
writer
would
summarize
each
paragraph
they
had
already
written
with
a
one
word
sentence.
Then
we
would
go
over
the
sentences
as
a
whole
and
see
how
they
related
to
the
thesis
and
whether
they
were
in
a
logical
order.
Using
this
method,
the
writer
could
easily
see
how
paragraphs
did
or
did
not
fit
into
their
papers
and
could
rearrange
paragraphs
that
they
wrote
in
a
more
logical
order
rather
than
starting
from
scratch
again.
This
technique
really
opened
my
eyes
to
how
different
writers
work.
My
first
instinct
when
preparing
to
write
a
paper
is
always
to
formulate
a
thesis
statement
and
then
the
rest
would
just
flow
to
me
in
a
mostly
logical
order.
But
I
found
that
not
every
writer
worked
like
this
and
that
some
people
prefer
to
just
sit
down
and
write
and
then
figure
out
what
their
thesis
is
later.
This
experience
has
changed
the
way
that
I
go
about
beginning
an
assignment.
I
still
begin
with
my
thesis
and
run
from
there,
but
now
I
often
go
through
my
papers
and
backward
outline
them
to
see
if
what
I
have
written
is
focused
and
organized.
While
my
work
normally
has
been
organized,
this
skill
is
giving
me
the
chance
to
look
at
my
paper
in
a
new
way
and
in
a
sense
become
a
more
sophisticated
reader.
Since
I
already
had
developed
the
skills
that
allow
me
to
select
a
thesis
and
write
a
satisfactory
paper,
with
this
method,
I
am
now
taking
my
writing
to
a
new
level
by
looking
at
my
acceptable
papers
and
attempting
to
make
them
even
better.
As
with
many
things
in
life,
practice
makes
perfect.
I
know
that
as
I
continue
to
write,
I
will
grow
more
as
a
writer.
And
I
see
that
working
as
a
writing
associate
has
helped
me
grow
as
well.
At
the
end
of
the
Fall
semester
I
had
a
conference
with
my
partner
teacher
in
which
we
discussed
the
studentOs
final
papers
and
their
progression
since
the
beginning
of
the
year.
In
speaking
about
the
students
work
I
truly
felt
like
an
accomplished
writer
who
had
the
ability
to
tactfully
consider
anotherOs
work
and
comment
on
the
finer
points
and
the
places
that
could
be
improved.
Reflecting
on
this
past
year,
I
see
that
my
position
as
a
writing
associate
has
been
mutually
beneficial
D
I
help
the
writers
build
confidence
about
their
work
and
show
them
how
to
pull
essays
together
and,
in
return,
they
give
me
experience
and
show
me
new
ways
of
looking
at
writing.
This
realization
about
my
writing
abilities
makes
me
feel
prepared
for
any
type
of
paper
I
encounter
as
a
writing
associate
and
any
type
of
assignment
I
receive.
I
am
looking
forward
to
another
year
as
a
writing
associate,
and
will
do
my
best
to
show
the
student
writers
all
I
have
discovered
about
writing.
