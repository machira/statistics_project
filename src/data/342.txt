WA
Assignment
My
Life
As
A
Writer
It
all
began
about
fifteen
years
ago.
I
was
five
then
and
in
Mrs.
Bartelameo's
first
grade
class.
That
is
when
I
have
my
first
memory
of
being
a
writer.
I'm
sure
I
did
some
"writing"
before
then,
but
it
was
probably,
more
along
the
lines
of
learning
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
and
forming
simple
words,
which
I
really
don't
consider
"writing."
As
I
mentioned
before,
I
became
a
writer
in
first
grade.
I
couldn't
tell
you
why
I
wrote
what
I
wrote,
what
the
assignment
was,
or
even
if
there
was
an
assignment,
but
I
wrote,
and
I
wrote
what
was
on
my
mind.
I
was
inspired
by
a
conversation
I
overheard
between
my
mom
and
dad.
My
dad
had
just
come
home
from
work
and
he
seemed
a
bit
distressed.
I
listened
in
some
more
and
discovered
that
he
had
gotten
a
speeding
ticket
on
the
way
home,
so
with
an
oversized,
number
two
pencil
in
hand,
on
an
extra-extra
wide
ruled,
green
piece
of
paper,
I
wrote
about
it.
When
I
was
finished,
I
showed
it
to
my
parents.
My
mom
was
amused;
my
father
was
not.
Despite
my
dad's
wishes,
I
brought
it
to
class
and
handed
it
in
the
next
morning.
Mrs.
Bartelameo
gave
a
little
chuckle
when
she
read
it
too.
For
the
first
time
I
realized
that
writing,
especially
my
own
writing,
could
be
used
to
evoke
others'
emotions.
Fourth
grade
was
a
big
year.
During
this
year
there
were
many
instances
that
were
pivotal
to
my
growth
as
a
writer.
One
small,
but
important
example
was
the
jump
from
pencil
to
pen
(provided
we
could
prove
our
neatness
with
ink).
I
was
so
nervous
on
the
writing-in-pen-test
day,
because
I
didn't
think
I
was
going
to
pass,
seeing
as
though
I
am
a
lefty,
and
therefore
at
a
slight
disadvantage.
(Lefties
tend
to
smear
ink
as
they
write.)
I
passed.
Erasable
pens
was
the
popular
choice
for
writing
implement
among
my
peers.
It
took
me
many
years
to
switch
over
to
regular
pen,
because
I
relied
so
heavily
on
the
eraser.
In
fourth
grade
we
were
also
allowed
to
switch
from
writing
in
print
to
writing
in
cursive.
Actually,
it
was
more
like
we
HAD
to
write
in
cursive
rather
than
print.
I
used
to
enjoy
writing
in
cursive
when
I
was
one
of
the
few
who
were
able
to,
but
now
that
I
was
forced
to
do
it,
I
really
did
not
enjoy
it.
From
this
point
through
eighth
grade
we
were
required
to
write
in
cursive,
because
(and
we
heard
this
same
speech
every
year)
once
we
got
into
high
school,
that's
how
everyone
wrote,
so
we
needed
this
year
to
practice.
Once
I
hit
high
school,
I
stopped
writing
in
cursive
and
haven't
returned
to
it
since.
My
fourth
grade
class
had
to
write
letters
to
public
officials.
For
the
first
time
I
recognized
writing
as
a
serious
thing
that
could
be
used
to
persuade
others'
opinions.
Grammar,
neat
handwriting,
and
correct
word
choice
suddenly
became
important
when
the
assignments
had
more
weight.
The
general
trend
of
the
class
seemed
to
be
writing
in
the
real
world,
so
to
make
the
year
complete
we
made
our
own
newspaper.
I
was
good
at
drawing
cartoons,
so
my
teacher
put
Steve,
the
class
clown,
and
me
together
to
create
the
newspaper's
comic
strip.
I
ABSOLUTELY
LOVED
IT!
There
were
a
few
instances
of
bickering
between
Steve
and
I,
but
I
was
happy
with
the
end
product.
The
strip
made
everyone
laugh.
I
enjoyed
making
people
smile,
and
to
this
day,
drawing
comics
for
my
friends
is
something
I
love
to
do.
I
just
wish
I
could
invest
more
time
into
them.
Speaking
of
collaborative
writing,
another
fourth
grade
assignment
(I
promise,
this
is
the
last
one)
was
to
create
a
fictional
short
story
with
a
partner.
My
partner
was
Gabrielle,
and
we
wrote
about
a
guy
who
got
stranded
on
a
tropical
island.
I
thought
having
an
extra
person
would
make
the
job
so
much
easier,
but
instead
I
found
the
task
to
be
very
difficult.
Both
of
us
had
our
own
vision
of
where
the
story
should
go,
so
I
had
to
compromise
what
I
thought
was
best
to
appease
my
partner.
I'm
sure
she
had
to
do
the
same
as
well.
After
reading
the
story
to
the
class,
I
felt
embarrassed
with
our
work.
I
often
feel
that
way
about
my
creative
writing.
Why?
I'm
not
sure,
but
I
do.
I
much
more
preferred
the
collaborative
writing
assignment
to
write
a
commercial.
My
group
did
really
well,
and
it
even
inspired
me
to
write
my
own
movie
for
my
friends
and
film
it.
Next
came
those
wonderful
Jr.
High
years
when
writing
really
picked
up.
I
had
a
substantial
amount
of
writing
in
every
class
that
ranged
from
History
essays
to
lab
reports
and
from
letters
in
Spanish
to
short
stories
in
English.
Most
of
my
writing
was
done
in
my
seventh
grade
English
class.
We
focused
on
creative
writing
and
most
of
our
works
were
peer
reviewed.
Peer
review
took
me
out
of
my
comfort
zone.
It
made
me
realize
that
writing
could
make
me
vulnerable
and
open
to
criticism.
After
many
years,
I've
come
to
grips
with
the
fact
that
that's
just
the
way
writing
is.
For
our
final,
we
had
to
write
a
timed
short
story,
so
I
grabbed
my
pen
with
my
sweaty
hands
and
went
to
work.
Before
I
knew
it,
I
was
going
up
and
asking
for
more
paper.
I
was
all
encompassed
with
my
writing,
so
much
so
that
I
worked
through
the
bell.
At
the
end,
my
hand
was
cramped
and
covered
in
ink,
but
I
knew
I
was
handing
in
a
quality
piece
of
writing.
It
felt
good
to
be
a
writer
then.
In
eighth
grade
we
had
to
take
a
state-issued
standardized
test
that
included
a
writing
section.
We
spent
many
tedious
hours
preparing
for
the
persuasive
essay,
but
I
gained
a
few
useful
pointers.
I
learned
to
look
for
key
words
in
questions,
to
map
out
my
ideas,
to
pre-write
my
response,
and
to
quickly
proof
read
my
work
within
a
limited
amount
of
time.
I
dislike
pressure
writing,
and
therefore
learned
to
dislike
writing
during
eighth
grade.
My
teacher
emphasized
grammar
too.
Grammar
bored
me
and
I
never
really
fully
understood
it,
so
that
turned
me
off
to
writing
even
more.
I
didn't
realize
it
at
the
time,
but
ninth
grade
was
a
turning
point
in
my
writing.
My
English
teacher
tried
to
convince
my
class
that
no
story
was
just
a
story;
there
was
always
a
deeper
meaning
or
an
underlying
purpose
behind
it.
My
class
was
not
ready
to
believe
that,
so
for
an
entire
year
we
fought
back
to
prove
otherwise.
That
lasted
until
he
made
us
write
our
own
short
story
with
a
moral.
I
finally
got
it
then.
For
a
story
to
stand
out
from
the
rest,
it
needs
to
have
more
than
a
plot.
I
wrote
a
story
about
a
little
boy,
Tim,
and
his
adventure
with
his
teddy
bear,
James.
Through
this
assignment
I
became
aware
of
my
writing
process
and
found
a
love
for
writing
children's
stories.
My
writing
process
has
remained
the
same
ever
since.
As
you
read
this
on
a
neatly
typed
page,
know
that
there
is
another
copy
floating
around
on
lined
paper,
(or
whatever
other
scraps
of
paper
happened
to
be
near
by
when
I
was
in
writing
mode)
written
in
scribbled
handwriting
using
either
pen
or
pencil,
and
with
words
and
arrows
going
in
every
direction,
numerous
crossed
out
phrases,
little
doodles,
and
notes
to
myself.
I
give
much
credit
to
anyone
who
can
decipher
my
rough
drafts!
I
was
reading
Disney
Adventures
magazine
one
day
and
a
writing
contest
caught
my
eye.
I
was
given
the
first
half
of
a
story
written
by
R.L.
Stine
and
my
job
was
to
finish
it.
The
grand
prize
was
to
have
your
version
printed
in
the
next
edition
of
the
magazine,
which
I
thought
was
pretty
cool,
so
I
entered.
As
I
expected,
I
didn't
win
the
grand
prize,
but
I
did
much
better
than
I
thought.
I
won
third
prize.
It
was
just
a
book
and
a
Goosebumps
computer
game,
which
I
honestly
have
yet
to
play,
but
I
was
so
shocked
and
thrilled
that
I
did
so
well
in
a
national
writing
contest
that
I
didn't
even
care
about
the
prize.
Tenth
grade
was
the
year
of
the
killer
thesis
paper.
For
two
whole
months
my
nose
was
buried
in
books
researching
my
obscure
history
topic.
Books,
photocopies,
highlighters,
pens,
paper
clips,
and
scraps
of
paper
cluttered
my
bedroom
floor.
My
history
teacher
was
strict
and
demanded
that
there
were
no
spelling
or
grammatical
errors,
no
missed
citations,
no
stylistic
flaws,
and
no
unnecessary
or
false
information.
When
my
paper
was
complete,
I
felt
a
sense
of
ownership
for
it.
It
was
my
child
and
no
one
was
going
to
even
come
close
enough
to
breathe
wrong
on
it.
Those
two
months
were
painful,
but
I
did
walk
away
with
some
important
skills.
Mainly,
I
learned
to
pose
a
question,
and
simply
answer
it
without
any
gratuitous
garbage.
Poetry
has
never
been
my
thing,
or
at
least
I
could
never
understand
it
while
reading
it,
so
I
assumed
that
writing
it
would
be
just
as
frustrating.
But
weird
things
started
happening
around
tenth
grade
(maybe
earlier)
and
I'd
get
these
flashes
of
poetry
ideas.
It's
like
the
rhythm
of
my
soul
was
suddenly
put
into
words.
I
keep
a
pen
an
paper
next
to
my
bed,
because
more
often
than
not,
these
moments
happen
just
before
I
fall
asleep
or
right
after
I
wake
up.
They're
quick
too.
I
think
of
words
faster
than
I
can
transcribe
them
on
paper,
so
I
need
writing
materials
handy.
Nobody
really
knows
this
about
me,
but
if
you
searched
my
room,
I
guarantee
you'd
find
little
scraps
of
unfinished
poetry
in
every
notebook
and
journal
I
own.
While
in
tenth
grade,
I
was
also
asked
to
write
a
poem
for
English
class.
It
was
almost
Christmas
time
so
I
wrote
a
poem
about
Christ's
birth.
I
often
don't
think
my
poetry
is
good,
but
apparently
my
teacher
thought
otherwise,
because
she
submitted
my
poem
to
be
included
in
our
school's
writing
anthology.
I
felt
pretty
honored.
It
didn't
end
there,
however.
My
mom
gave
it
to
someone
and
somehow
my
poem
ended
up
being
printed
on
all
the
church
bulletins
for
Christmas
Eve.
I
certainly
was
surprised.
It
felt
nice
to
have
my
work
"published"
in
something
that
didn't
pertain
to
school.
To
this
day,
I
still
get
complements
on
that
poem.
It
boosted
my
confidence
in
writing
enough
for
me
to
decide
to
write
a
poem
my
senior
year
and
enter
it
into
the
Teen
Arts
Festival,
a
statewide
arts
festival.
My
poem
ultimately
was
selected
to
be
included
in
an
anthology
and
read
at
a
poetry
reading.
I
got
a
chance
to
sit
down
with
a
professional
writer
who
critiqued
my
writing.
I
expected
him
to
rip
apart
my
poem,
but
instead
he
praised
it
and
offered
a
few
minor
suggestions.
His
words
were
encouraging
and
it
really
made
me
consider
making
writing
a
part
of
my
future.
I've
always
managed
to
do
well
on
writing
assignments
over
the
years,
but
I've
never
considered
myself
an
extraordinary
writer.
So
when
I
went
off
to
college,
I
expected
to
be
a
"little
fish
in
a
big
pond."
Actually,
my
FYS
professor
all
but
assured
my
class
that
we
would
fail
his
first
paper,
which
shot
down
any
high
expectations
I
had
for
me
as
a
writer.
I
guess
high
school
aptly
prepared
me
for
college,
because
I
somehow
aced
that
class.
My
writing,
of
course,
was
not
perfect,
so
I
did
receive
some
criticism
from
that
professor,
but
it
only
made
me
write
clearer
and
back
everything
up
with
research.
Because
I
did
well
in
FYS,
I
hoped
to
pass
out
of
College
Writing
and
get
a
jump
on
my
major
courses.
To
my
disappointment,
my
request
was
denied.
Now,
I'm
glad
it
was,
because
I
learned
so
much
in
that
class.
The
class
taught
me
how
to
better
organize
my
writing,
how
to
grab
the
reader's
attention,
and
how
to
filter
out
non-vital
information
from
my
paper.
More
importantly,
the
class
restored
confidence
in
my
writing.
This
past
year
I
did
more
writing
than
I've
ever
done
in
my
entire
life.
My
American
Studies
class
was
responsible
for
over
half
of
it
and
my
professor
was
extremely
tough
when
it
came
to
grading,
so
I
learned
to
be
a
careful
and
thoughtful
writer.
By
looking
at
advertisements,
photos,
speeches,
novels,
and
movies
I
acquired
a
few
rhetoric
strategies
and
discovered
that
words
combined
with
pictures
makes
a
powerful
form
of
communication.
I
am
a
very
visual
person
and
this
emphasized
the
need
for
me
to
paint
pictures
with
my
words.
Our
final
project
was
a
10-20
page
research
paper
and
with
a
professor
who
was
such
a
hard
greater,
I
didn't
know
what
to
expect.
Needless
to
say,
I
was
rather
surprised
when
I
received
an
A.
My
professor
was
so
pleased
with
the
paper
that
he
asked
for
a
copy
to
keep.
I
believe
that
is
the
greatest
complement
a
professor
can
give.
While
I
was
in
American
Studies,
I
was
also
doing
some
writing
for
my
Literary
Questions
class.
The
type
of
writing
for
this
class
was
of
a
critical
nature,
which
I
was
not
used
to.
By
analyzing
others'
works,
however,
I
became
more
conscious
of
my
own
writing.
Critical
analysis
did
not
come
easy
to
me
at
first,
so
I
sought
the
help
of
my
professor.
She
read
over
the
beginnings
of
my
paper,
which
was,
more
or
less,
me
informally
pouring
my
frustrations
out
on
paper.
Because,
I
was
always
taught
to
be
formal
in
my
writing,
I
would
have
never
considered
continuing
on
with
my
paper
in
such
a
tone.
She,
however,
encouraged
me
to
do
otherwise
and
to
write
how
I
felt.
It
felt
so
freeing
to
write
in
MY
voice.
I
enjoyed
being
able
to
add
personality
to
my
writing.
There
is
definitely
a
risk
involved
in
writing
with
a
less
formal
tone,
so
I
am
grateful
for
my
professor's
acceptance
of
it
and
now
I
am
not
so
afraid
to
try
it
again.
My
last
experience
as
a
writer
(aside
from
this
paper)
was
by
far
the
most
difficult
assignment
I've
ever
had.
It
was
a
research
paper
for
a
psychology
course.
Psychology
papers
are
a
whole
new
breed
of
writing,
but
what
made
things
really
bad
was
that
my
professor
was
an
extremely
picky
grader.
Students
avoid
this
professor
at
all
costs
just
to
not
have
to
write
this
paper.
I
can't
begin
to
tell
you
the
blood,
sweat,
and
tears
that
went
into
this
paper
and
how
much
I
dreaded
getting
it
back.
Brilliant
writers
have
received
grades
as
low
as
a
ten
on
the
paper,
so
my
mouth
literally
hit
the
floor
when
I
got
my
paper
back.
I
got
an
A,
and
my
professor
wanted
a
copy
of
my
paper
to
use
as
an
example
for
next
year.
I
have
a
love/hate
relationship
with
writing.
I
put
everything
I
have
into
papers,
so
the
writing
process
for
me
is
often
tedious
and
drawn
out,
but
responses
to
my
writing,
like
the
examples
above,
are
what
keep
me
going.
My
writing
is
nowhere
near
perfect,
and
I
know
I
have
much
more
to
learn.
While
writing
this
paper,
I
had
the
ability
to
see
the
benefits
of
the
many
assignments
I
originally
thought
were
pointless,
stupid,
or
too
challenging.
I
guess
my
teachers
really
DID
know
what
they
were
doing
after
all.
