My
Past
Year
as
a
WA:E
EE
E
E
EI
remember
coming
into
college
my
freshman
year
and
having
the
D
oh
so
popular
D
mentality
of,
NIOm
just
not
a
good
writerO.
The
longest
paper
I
had
ever
written
in
high
school
was
four
pages
and
I
honestly
never
felt
challenged.
I
then
found
myself
in
a
class
my
freshman
year
which
asked
me
to
write
a
ten
page
research
paper
and
was
instantly
overwhelmed.
It
took
some
real
adjusting,
along
with
some
motivation,
but
I
eventually
came
to
the
conclusion
that
writing
is
partially
a
state
of
mind.
Convincing
myself
that
I
was
not
a
good
writer
or
telling
myself
that
my
writing
assignments
were
insurmountable
tasks
was
simply
not
going
to
get
me
anywhere.
I
then
look
back
on
my
first
experiences
with
the
College
Writing
Program
during
my
Freshman
Year
Seminar
course.
It
was
at
that
point
that
I
realized
how
useful
a
WA
could
really
be
in
facilitating
the
writing
process
and
also
when
I
realized
that
writing
was
not
impossible
for
me.
The
guidance
that
I
received
from
my
WA
that
first
year
of
college
was
a
large
part
of
the
reason
that
I
decided
to
become
one.
College
writing
is
a
point
of
transition
and
adjustment.
Having
someone
facilitate
that
process
for
me
was
exactly
what
I
needed.
Within
the
past
year
of
being
a
Writing
Associate
I
have
come
across
an
array
of
learning
experience.
I
have
had
incredibly
successful
and
productive
conferences
but
have
also
had
some
very
awkward
and
challenging
conferences.
I
have
reflected
on
my
own
writing
process
to
decide
how
to
guide
other
through
theirs.
I
have
also
had
moments
of
great
revelation
in
which
I
feel
that
ITve
learned
more
from
the
students
that
I
worked
with
than
they
learned
from
me.
Overall,
being
a
WA
has
both
challenged
me
and
enhanced
me.
In
a
more
personal
sense,
being
a
Writing
Associate
has
largely
impacted
my
own
writing
process.
In
analyzing
someone
elseTs
work,
I
have
also
learned
how
to
analyze
my
own
and
think
more
critically
about
my
writing.
I
can
recall
a
time
when
I
did
not
make
outlines
or
brainstorm
before
a
paper.
I
would
just
sit
down
and
write,
straight
off
the
top
of
my
head.
While,
in
a
way,
that
was
a
process
within
itself,
I
have
learned
to
make
sure
thatOs
not
my
only
step.
Free
writing
is
still
a
large
part
of
my
process,
but
being
a
WA
has
led
me
to
learn
how
to
edit
and
criticize
my
work.
I
organize
my
thoughts
much
better
and
have
gained
the
ability
to
plan
effectively,
something
that
I
lacked
beforehand.
I
remember
one
particular
WA
conference
that
truly
led
me
to
reevaluate
myself
and
my
writing
process.
The
student
I
was
working
with
had
to
write
a
ten
page
paper
about
community
organizing
and
the
arts.
As
I
read
the
paper
before
the
conference
I
was
writing
down
methods
that
I
felt
the
student
should
use
to
evaluate
the
paper
before
handing
it
in.
That
particular
students
writing
process
appeared
to
be
very
similar
to
my
own
at
the
time,
that
being
just
writing
off
the
top
of
your
head
and
letting
things
flow.
As
I
read
the
paper,
I
was
able
to
get
a
grasp
of
where
the
student
was
going
with
the
paper
and
what
the
argument
was.
I
was
even
able
to
decipher
how
the
student
had
organized
ideas
in
their
mind
while
writing.
At
that
point
I
noticed
precisely
what
needed
to
be
done
to
improve
this
paper
and
made
an
instant
connection
to
my
own
writing.
I
was
lacking
the
same
processes
in
my
writing
that
my
student
was.
Neither
one
of
us
would
go
back
after
writing
and
read
the
paper
over.
We
put
our
ideas
on
paper
but
did
not
further
analyze
if
there
was
a
better
way
of
organizing
our
thoughts
or
a
better
way
of
explaining
them.
Once
I
sat
down
and
discussed
the
paper
with
the
student,
things
became
a
lot
clearer
for
the
both
of
us.
Sentence
and
paragraph
organization
became
the
main
topic
of
discussion
as
we
discussed
the
sequence
of
ideas
in
the
paper
and
how
to
best
present
them.
While
my
student
walked
away
feeling
much
more
confident
and
comfortable
with
their
paper,
I
walked
away
with
a
deeper
understanding
of
my
writing
and
precisely
what
my
weak
points
were
and
how
to
address
them.
Each
individual
conference
becomes
a
point
of
reflection
for
me.
I
reflect
about
myself
and
my
writing
as
well
as
how
effective
the
conference
was,
allowing
me
to
come
up
with
better
ways
to
approach
my
next
conference.
Conferences
always
have
the
capability
to
vary
greatly
from
one
student
to
the
next.
The
needs
of
one
individual
may
not
always
be
in
line
with
the
needs
of
another.
Therefore,
being
a
WA
requires
adaptability.
I
have
come
across
situations
where
I
walked
away
from
a
conference
feeling
like
I
made
a
real
difference
and
truly
helped
my
student.
On
the
other
hand,
I
have
also
had
conferences
where
I
was
left
questioning
where
things
went
wrong
and
feeling
a
need
to
set
up
another
meeting
with
the
student
in
order
to
ensure
that
they
would
be
alright.
My
perception
of
a
successful
conference
has
changed
significantly
since
I
first
started
as
a
WA,
mostly
due
to
the
experiences
I
have
had.
I
recall
approaching
my
conferences
with
the
intent
of
simply
helping
students
improve
the
papers
they
wrote
at
the
time.
I
have
now
come
to
consider
a
conference
successful
when
the
student
walks
away
with
a
greater
understanding
of
their
writing
process.
Through
my
conferences
with
students
I
realized
that
it
would
be
of
greater
help
to
them
to
focus
on
helping
them
understand
and
improve
their
writing
process
than
to
just
focus
on
how
to
fix
that
one
individual
paper.
One
particular
student
exemplified
this
for
me
and
truly
made
me
see
that
looking
at
the
bigger
picture
was
necessary.
I
remember
reading
his
paper
before
our
conference
and
preparing
myself
to
talk
to
him
about
what
his
main
argument
was,
why
a
particular
sentence
worked
better
in
another
place,
and
things
of
that
nature.
When
I
sat
down
and
spoke
to
him,
everything
we
discussed
was
very
specific
to
that
one
paper.
After
the
conference
I
felt
that
he
knew
exactly
how
to
go
back
and
edit
his
work
in
order
to
get
his
message
across
effectively.
About
a
week
later
I
spoke
to
the
professor
for
the
course
and
read
his
edited
paper.
The
student
had
indeed
improved
a
lot
from
his
original
draft.
Later
on
in
the
semester,
the
class
received
another
assignment.
When
I
came
across
that
one
particular
studentOs
paper
I
expected
it
to
need
minor
adjustments.
Yet,
I
was
surprised
to
see
that
he
had
made
the
same
exact
organizational
errors
that
he
had
made
in
the
previous
paper.
At
that
point
I
realized
that
in
my
conferences
I
needed
to
focus
on
helping
my
students
with
their
overall
writing
process
and
how
the
approach
their
work.
I
was
slightly
reminded
of
the
saying,
Ngive
a
man
a
fish
and
you
feed
him
for
a
day,
teach
a
man
how
to
fish
and
you
feed
him
for
a
lifetimeO.
If
I
managed
to
help
students
improve
their
writing
process
and
learn
to
self-edit
instead
of
just
working
on
fixing
that
one
paper,
their
overall
writing
would
improve.
I
later
met
with
that
student
and
discussed
with
him
how
he
went
about
preparing
a
paper
and
how
he
organized
his
ideas
beforehand.
After
a
long
discussion,
we
managed
to
work
out
a
plan
that
worked
best
for
him
and
the
results
were
evident
in
the
rest
of
his
papers
for
the
semester.
It
was
at
that
point
that
I
solidified
what
I
felt
was
a
successful
conference.
One
of
the
things
that
I
have
found
most
difficult
about
being
a
WA
and
working
with
other
studentOs
work
is
managing
to
avoid
pushing
your
own
opinion
or
voice
on
the
student.
It
is
natural
when
reading
and
editing
a
paper
to
want
to
put
what
you
personally
think
is
right
in
the
paper.
I
remember
the
very
first
time
I
was
preparing
for
a
conference
with
a
student.
As
I
was
reading
the
paper,
I
found
myself
correcting
it
in
my
head.
I
was
not
only
wanting
to
address
issues
of
organization
and
structure,
but
also
felt
an
urge
to
fix
how
certain
things
were
said
and
the
manner
in
which
some
ideas
were
expressed.
During
my
conversation
with
the
student,
I
came
to
notice
that
those
were
not
things
that
should
be
of
my
concern.
It
became
clear
that
the
studentOs
voice
should
not
be
lost
in
the
editing
of
the
paper.
The
ideas
being
expressed
were
not
mine;
therefore
I
had
no
place
attempting
to
fix
those
aspects.
In
conversations
with
other
WAOs
I
came
to
find
that
I
was
definitely
not
the
only
one
facing
this
struggle.
Over
time
I
managed
to
learn
to
shut
out
that
aspect
of
my
paper
review,
which
should
only
be
used
when
looking
over
my
own
work.
In
learning
to
do
this
I
have
also
managed
to
improve
my
own
writing
process.
When
I
reviewed
my
own
papers
I
would
constantly
get
stuck
on
fixing
the
NvoiceO
of
the
paper
and
the
manner
in
which
I
expressed
myself.
In
that
process
I
would
lose
sight
of
other
issues,
like
sentence
order
and
organization.
Therefore,
when
I
was
able
to
stop
myself
from
analyzing
studentOs
papers
in
that
manner,
I
was
also
able
to
apply
that
to
my
own
papers
and
improve
my
writing.
The
act
of
being
a
WA
has
proved
greatly
beneficial
to
my
writing
process.
On
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
being
a
WA
also
has
its
frustrating
and
irritating
aspects.
Some
instances
can
prove
to
be
extremely
challenging.
I
have
come
across
a
number
of
situations
with
students
which
tested
my
ability
to
help
them.
For
the
most
part,
students
are
appreciative
of
the
help
and
take
full
advantage
of
it.
Inevitably
though,
there
will
be
a
small
number
of
students
who
do
not
put
forth
much
effort
when
it
comes
to
conferences
and
either
completely
avoid
meetings
or
do
not
bother
to
take
the
advice.
The
most
challenging
experience
I
have
had
was
during
my
first
semester
as
WA.
I
was
working
with
an
FYS
course
and
was
meeting
with
the
students
regarding
their
final
paper
for
the
semester.
Having
already
met
with
most
of
the
students
twice,
once
for
their
outline
and
again
for
a
draft,
I
became
concerned
about
one
particular
student
who
had
not
shown
up
to
either
meeting.
The
fact
that
the
student
displayed
no
interest
in
meeting
with
me
or
discussing
the
assignment
was
making
my
job
all
the
more
difficult
and
frustrating.
I
made
a
number
of
attempts
to
contact
that
student
and
finally
managed
to
set
something
up.
During
the
entire
conference
the
student
appeared
disinterested
and
made
no
attempt
to
ask
any
questions
and
vaguely
answered
some
of
mine.
Eventually,
the
student
said
that
they
really
felt
no
need
for
the
conference
because
they
felt
their
paper
was
done
and
was
Nas
good
as
it
was
going
to
getO.
I
continued
to
try
and
discuss
some
parts
of
the
paper
with
the
student
and
try
to
get
a
feel
for
where
they
were
headed
and
what
their
message
was.
By
the
end
of
the
conference
I
was
left
feeling
unaccomplished,
as
if
I
had
failed
to
get
through
to
that
student
or
help
them
in
any
way.
At
the
end
of
the
day,
I
had
to
come
to
terms
with
the
fact
that
some
students
may
have
little
interest
in
meeting
with
their
WAOs.
I
just
had
to
stick
to
my
end
of
the
deal
by
reaching
out
to
the
student
and
making
an
effort
to
help
them.
I
had
to
learn
how
to
not
let
myself
get
significantly
upset
over
a
student
who
did
not
put
in
the
effort.
I
managed
to
put
my
time
to
use
for
another
student
who
sought
more
help
on
their
assignment,
which
turned
out
to
be
very
successful.
Overall,
my
past
year
working
with
the
College
Writing
Program
has
been
nothing
short
of
a
learning
experience.
I
have
learned
a
lot
about
myself
and
my
writing
in
the
process,
which
has
greatly
improved
my
academic
experience.
I
have
also
gained
the
satisfaction
that
comes
with
helping
other
students
through
their
writing
struggles,
especially
because
I
recognize
so
many
of
my
own
struggles
in
them.
My
goal
in
working
as
a
WA
was
to
be
just
as
useful
to
my
students
as
my
own
WAOs
have
been
to
me
in
the
past.
I
have
come
to
truly
respect
the
job
and
respect
the
students
we
work
with
as
well,
they
are
open
to
criticism
and
willing
and
able
to
work
out
any
issues
that
arise.
Needless
to
say,
being
a
WA
has
been
one
of
the
highlights
of
my
academic
experience
at
Lafayette
and
I
am
more
than
happy
to
continue
doing
it
for
my
senior
year.
