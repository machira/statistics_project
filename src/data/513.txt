Blair-Miller,
Writing
Associate
Program
Summer
Writing
Assignment
11
August
2006
After
initially
reading
the
Writing
Associate
ProgramOs
summer
writing
assignment
for
all
new
incoming
Writing
Associates
(WAs),
I
felt
that
I
could
not
have
received
an
easier
task.
Unfortunately,
as
time
progressed,
I
realized
just
how
difficult
it
is
to
remember
things
that
most
take
for
granted,
such
as
their
earliest
writing
experiences.
With
that
said,
the
first
occasion
that
I
can
remember
encountering
writing
took
place
in
my
first-grade
classroom.
I
can
easily
visualize
the
paper
with
large
dotted
lines
dividing
the
page,
a
helpful
tool
that
indicated
the
typical
height
of
each
letter
and
encouraged
children
to
stay
within
the
lines.
On
these
pages,
my
classmates
and
I
would
practice
our
letters
and,
later,
write
stories
consisting
of
a
few
sentences
as
a
way
of
perfecting
our
ability
to
form
sentences.
Today,
those
adolescent
stories
may
seem
trivial,
but
any
type
of
writing
helps
build
superior
writing
skills,
even
broken
sentences
about
random
events.
This
childhood
memory
represents
the
earliest
knowledge
about
writing
that
I
possess.
Therefore,
these
first-grade
experiences
kicked-off
my
future
as
a
writer.
As
I
progressed
through
the
tiers
of
elementary
school,
teachers
expected
students
to
write
logical
paragraphs
conveying
their
thoughts.
While
second
through
fifth
grade
provided
fours
years
of
practice
at
expository
writing,
my
last
years
of
elementary
school
introduced
to
me
a
new
type
of
writing:
informal
writing.
It
was
during
this
time
that
I
started
to,
albeit
inconsistently,
write
in
a
journal.
My
diary
provided
an
outlet
for
my
varied
emotions
and
allowed
me
to
write
anything
and
everything.
Like
so
many,
I
would
vent
my
emotions
about
family
members
and
friends,
or
I
could
spill
my
feelings
about
the
boy
I
had
a
crush
on
at
the
time.
While
an
enjoyable
activity,
journal
writing
emphasized
writing
clearly
about
my
thoughts
and
emotions.
So
many
times,
people
have
complex
thoughts
and
find
difficulty
in
describing
them
to
others.
As
a
result,
writing
journal
entries
helped
ease
the
mental
distress
of
various
emotions
and
provided
practice
for
clearly
conveying
my
thoughts.
After
making
the
transition
into
middle
school,
teachers
soon
introduced
me
to
a
more
comprehensive
style
of
writing.
In
addition
to
perfecting
grammar,
instructors
began
to
integrate
the
importance
of
writing
content
and
fluidity.
Papers
were
expected
to
be
longer
and
prompts
became
more
complex.
It
was
also
in
middle
school
that
I
first
experienced
writing
for
the
purpose
of
public
speaking.
In
eighth
grade,
while
enrolled
in
the
enrichment
program
at
my
school,
I
received
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
a
forensics
competition.
Alongside
a
friend,
I
chose
to
enter
into
the
debate
portion
of
the
competition.
This
forced
me
to
learn
how
to
write
a
logical
argument
that
I
could
present
to
others
in
a
clear
and
logical
fashion.
For
the
first
time,
I
realized
the
importance
of
my
writing
with
respect
to
practical
uses.
In
a
classroom,
a
teacher
grading
papers
does
not
relay
the
practicality
of
writing
because
it
represents
a
nonrealistic
situation.
In
the
real
world,
writing
has
a
real
purpose,
whereas
in
a
classroom,
most
students
write
because
a
teacher
requires
it
for
a
grade.
Experiencing
an
everyday
use
for
writing
made
the
activity
all
that
much
more
meaningful
and
enjoyable.
When
the
conclusion
of
middle
school
came
around,
I
had
to
go
through
the
process
of
course
selection
for
ninth
grade.
When
the
time
came
to
choose
an
English
course
for
the
following
year,
I
had
three
options.
I
could
take
English
II,
English
I,
or
Honors
English
(ranked
from
least
to
most
challenging).
At
this
age,
all
course
selections
required
a
teacherOs
initials.
Unfortunately,
my
teacher
refused
to
initial
my
request
to
take
Honors
English
due
to
the
fact
that
I
had
already
chosen
to
take
two
other
honors
courses.
To
this
day,
this
refusal
acted
as
a
serious
blow
to
my
aspirations.
I
felt
that
the
teacher
refused
based
on
reasons
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
academic
ability,
causing
a
feeling
of
inferiority
upon
entering
high
school.
In
addition,
my
friends
had
decided
to
take
the
more
challenging
English
course,
and
this
enhanced
my
feeling
that
I
lacked
the
intelligence
to
participate
in
the
course.
While
I
received
respectable
grades
throughout
high
school,
none
of
my
teachers
ever
recommended
that
I
move
up
to
the
honors
course,
and
I
started
to
believe
that
my
writing
abilities
were
wholly
unimpressive
and
unlikely
to
improve.
Prior
to
this
point,
I
had
fully
understood
that
I
did
not
represent
the
best
writer,
and
that
I
always
had
room
for
improvement,
but
eventually
my
opinions
of
myself
became
worse
as
teachers
found
ways
to
affect
my
self-esteem.
High
school
also
led
me
to
question
whether
or
not
one
true
way
of
writing
existed.
Teachers
often
spouted
the
philosophy
that
everyone
possessed
their
own
unique
style
of
writing,
which
implied
that
no
NwrongO
way
of
writing
existed.
In
theory,
this
sounds
fantastic,
but
I
often
found
that
the
teacherOs
statements
did
not
match
their
actions.
So
often
an
instructor
would
compliment
my
personal
writing
style
and
then
return
graded
papers
with
sentences
unnecessarily
worded
differently.
I
am
not
foolish
enough
to
believe
that
my
writing
is
the
best,
and
I
understand
that
sometimes
an
alternate
way
of
structuring
or
wording
a
sentence
can
make
the
section
as
a
whole
more
effective.
Yet,
there
remains
a
distinctive
difference
between
a
better
worded
sentence
and
personal
preference.
Eventually
it
came
to
the
point
where
I
felt
like
teachers
just
did
not
like
my
writing
and
always
felt
the
need
to
alter
it.
As
a
result,
these
years
of
education
changed
my
mindset
from
one
of
hope
to
one
of
failure.
Not
until
senior
year
of
high
school
did
I
have
the
opportunity
to
escape
the
confines
of
typical
high
school
education.
That
year,
I
enrolled
in
two
college
English
courses
offered
through
West
Chester
University
to
seniors
who
met
the
academic
requirements.
The
first
class
paralleled
most
introductory
writing
courses
and
covered
a
few
of
the
many
different
writing
genres.
In
this
class,
taught
by
a
professor
from
the
university,
we
learned
how
to
effectively
write
reviews,
persuasive
papers,
and
memoirs.
The
atmosphere
of
the
class
differed
greatly
from
the
previous
classes
in
which
I
had
partaken.
Students
were
encouraged
to
have
open
discussions,
participate
in
peer-review,
and
be
bold
with
their
writing,
something
similar
to
the
college
ambiance.
Experiencing
this
new
teacher
and
atmosphere
allowed
me
to
open
up
in
my
writing
and
worry
less
about
teacher
comments.
The
professor
offered
constructive
criticism,
making
it
clear
that
everyone
had
the
means
to
improve.
This
demeanor
cracked
my
previous
resolve
and
helped
prepare
me
for
the
opportunities
that
college
writing
had
to
offer.
While
my
final
year
in
high
school
helped
ease
my
previous
mindset,
it
had
not
completely
broken
my
attitude
towards
my
writing.
Therefore,
as
I
kicked
off
my
first
year
of
college,
I
felt
anxiety
over
the
expectations
of
college
level
writing,
and
whether
I
could
successfully
meet
the
challenge.
In
high
school,
teachers
relished
the
looks
on
studentsO
faces
when
told
about
the
uncompromising
attitude
of
college
professors.
Time
and
again,
I
would
hear
about
how
professors
would
automatically
give
a
student
a
failing
grade
if
presented
with
a
paper
containing
a
run-on
or
fragment.
While
these
grammatical
errors
had
been
heavily
focused
on
in
high
school,
and
I
had
intention
of
making
those
mistakes
the
idea
of
failing
something
on
the
spot
was
intimidating.
Teachers
implied
that
rough
drafts
represented
an
idea
of
the
past,
and
that
college
classes
did
not
incorporate
this
method.
As
a
result,
students
were
led
to
believe
that
they
had
one
shot
at
a
paper,
and
then
it
would
fall
prey
to
the
professorOs
discretion.
These
ideas
wracked
my
brain
and
left
me
feeling
overly
anxious
about
my
first
classes.
Needless
to
say,
some
professors
do
conduct
their
courses
incorporating
the
frightening
methods
above.
Fortunately,
I
soon
found
out
that
most
professors
utilize
a
method
that
incorporates
multiple
drafts,
as
well
as,
peer
editors.
This
eased
my
nervousness,
and
I
took
the
opportunity
to
start
with
a
clean
slate.
Fall
semester
of
my
freshman
year
went
by
without
any
major
problems.
Upon
entering
my
second
semester
of
college,
I
found
myself
enrolled
in
English
110,
an
entry
level
writing
course
required
of
all
students
as
a
prerequisite
for
graduation.
I
suppose
that
this
course
embodied
the
culmination
of
my
fears
regarding
writing.
The
class
required
the
production
of
various
genres
of
writing,
and
it
would
be
my
first
writing
intensive
course
of
my
secondary
education.
Throughout
the
duration
of
the
course,
I
would
go
through
several
drafts
and
often
meet
with
my
professor.
The
encouragement
that
he
provided
undoubtedly
helped
me
move
past
a
number
of
my
insecurities,
even
though
it
took
him
awhile
to
convince
me
that
my
writing
should
never
be
an
embarrassment.
This
professor
represents
the
first
person
to
truly
admire
my
ability
to
write
and
he
would
remain
a
mentor
for
me
in
my
future
endeavors.
It
was
also
during
this
time
that
I
attempted
to
move
away
from
completely
relying
on
my
computer,
my
tool
for
writing.
I
soon
discovered
the
importance
of
printing
off
papers
and
reading
through
a
hard
copy.
Reading
an
actual
piece
of
paper
and
making
notes
made
confusing
sections
or
grammatical
errors
more
apparent
than
when
staring
at
a
computer
screen.
Thus,
my
first
year
at
Lafayette
College
signifies
a
turning
point
in
my
writing
history.
When
sophomore
year
arrived,
it
brought
with
it
new
challenges.
Professors
expected
more
from
a
second
year
college
student
than
a
first
year
one.
Therefore,
I
met
the
challenges
with
a
desire
to
improve
my
writing
and
learn
from
the
experiences.
Fall
semester
I
participated
in
English
205
and
encountered
several
interesting
topics
and
reading
materials.
On
this
occasion,
the
required
reading
itself
made
writing
papers
more
complex
due
to
my
difficulty
interpreting
the
text;
therefore,
I
also
had
trouble
conveying
my
mixed
thoughts
through
writing.
While
keeping
a
journal
throughout
my
early
teenage
years
had
helped
me
prepare
for
communicating
my
thoughts,
it
had
not
trained
me
for
when
my
thoughts
were
completely
jumbled.
Consequently,
I
learned
only
after
experiencing
the
problem
firsthand.
To
this
day,
I
still
have
difficulty
fully
describing
situations
that
I
find
confusing
and
continue
to
work
on
the
challenge.
Additionally,
after
dealing
with
my
inability
to
fully
comprehend
the
twisted
content
in
my
readings,
English
205
and
my
professor
made
it
clear
that
it
was
acceptable
to
not
always
understand
something.
Although
it
took
me
time
to
fully
accept
this
concept,
it
definitely
helped
liberate
my
writing.
I
stopped
trying
to
write
as
though
I
had
to
know
everything,
and
learned
to
look
more
deeply
into
the
things
I
did
not
understand
instead
of
backing
away.
So
far,
my
college
writing
experience
has
proven
infinitely
better
than
that
of
my
primary
education,
but
I
cannot
deny
that
even
college
writing
has
some
quirks.
Some
professors
still
feel
the
need
to
alter
the
wording
of
my
sentences.
More
often
than
not,
I
agree
with
their
changes
and
appreciate
the
help.
Yet,
sometimes
professors
change
things
to
sound
the
way
they
would
write
them
when
my
version
was
also
well
written.
Personal
preference
can
still
interfere
with
my
writing,
but
such
is
life.
No
two
people
will
always
agree
allowing
for
differences
of
opinion
to
continuously
occur.
Overall,
my
life
with
respect
to
writing
has
taken
an
interesting
course.
Thinking
back,
I
remember
the
times
when
I
thought
that
my
stories
consisting
of
four-word
sentences
were
such
an
accomplishment,
and,
in
a
way,
they
were.
That
innocent
confidence
would
lead
me
through
my
years
of
schooling
and
paper
writing
until
I
would
experience
the
impact
of
others
on
my
work.
These
teachers
made
me
question
everything
I
wrote,
instead
of
just
focusing
on
what
my
instinct
said.
Not
until
I
entered
into
college-level
courses
did
I
first
experience
instructors
who
attempted
to
work
with
my
writing
instead
of
completely
reshaping
it.
This
helped
me
transform
from
someone
who
had
trouble
dealing
with
criticism
to
someone
who
now
appreciates
the
input
of
others.
While
I
regret
the
impression
that
critical
teachers
once
had
on
my
work,
it
has
helped
me
uncover
the
importance
between
understanding
the
difference
between
constructive
criticism
and
personal
opinion
and
made
me
the
writer
that
I
am
today.
