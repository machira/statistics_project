THE
EVOLUTION
OF
THE
NON-WRITER
Each
time
I
broach
the
subject
of
this
essay
in
my
mind
I
find
it
more
and
more
difficult
to
determine
how
my
writing
style
has
evolved
over
the
past
year.
When
I
then
attempt
to
convey
my
thoughts
on
paper
the
pressure
mounts
and
the
frustration
reaches
a
pinnacle.
It
is
then
that
I
realize,
after
quick
deliberation,
that
is
nearly
impossible
for
evolution
of
any
practice
to
occur
if
one
does
not
participate
in
the
act
that
warrants
reflection.
Because
my
past
year
was
one
of
concentrated
scientific
study
I
was
not
able
to
enhance
my
writing
experience
in
many
ways.
My
experience
as
a
writing
associate
was
my
one
chance
to
analyze
my
style
both
as
a
peer-editor
and
as
a
writer.
In
retrospect
it
was
not
my
writing
itself
that
changed
over
the
year
but
the
forms
of
writing
I
chose
to
express
my
thoughts.
As
the
Writing
Associate
for
the
AIDS:
The
Modern
Pandemic
VAST,
for
the
second
year,
I
was
able
to
experience
two
classes
interpretation
of
the
same
material
and
thus
add
to
my
own
ideas
in
regards
to
the
subject
matter.
This
years
class
had
open
and
broad
views
in
regards
to
AIDS
and
the
homosexual
population
whereas
the
year
before
was
more
conservative
in
this
light.
The
most
recent
class
chose
different
topics
for
their
final
projects
indicating
a
different
area
of
interest.
I
was
enlightened
with
topic
choices
and
the
students
seemed
to
be
more
passionate
about
the
subjects
and
the
disease
in
particular
that
the
previous
year.
The
contrast
between
the
two
groups
broadened
my
WA
experience
by
exposing
me
to
various
types
of
writing
styles
and
interpretations
of
the
same
information.
Also
with
the
evolution
of
scientific
information
regarding
AIDS
many
stepping
stones
have
been
reached
since
last
year,
adding
to
the
material
and
my
knowledge
of
the
subject
as
well.
Although
I
have
technically
never
been
enrolled
in
this
VAST
I
feel
that
participating
in
the
program
for
two
years
has
resulted
in
the
material
having
some
of
the
greatest
impacts
of
any
of
the
classes
I
have
really"
taken
over
the
past
three
years.
I
am
eager
to
be
a
part
of
this
ongoing
learning
experience
again
next
semester.
In
addition
to
increasing
my
knowledge
this
year's
experience
with
the
VAST
also
added
to
my
confidence
and
competence
as
a
WA.
Having
to
view
vastly
different
interpretations
from
year
to
year
I
had
to
leave
my
opinion
related
to
the
subject
out
and
avoid
swaying
the
writers
point
in
any
one
direction.
I
feel
that
I
developed
a
clearer
focus
in
regards
to
being
a
peer-
reader
and
not
an
editor
or
commentator.
Within
my
own
classes
I
had
little
chance
to
express
myself
through
writing.
I
could
probably
write
seven
pages
on
the
dissection
of
the
vertebrate
mammal
or
the
laws
of
thermodynamics
and
why
they
apply
to
almost
every
action
of
everyday
life
but
as
far
as
literary
analysis
I
am
definitely
lacking
practice.
The
one
skill
that
I
have
enhanced
through
my
scientific
study
is
the
art
of
being
precise.
Scientist
do
not
want
a
sing
song
story
or
any
dancing-around"
the
issue.
The
want
to
know
what
happened
and
why
and
what
could
be
done
to
make
the
procedure
more
efficient
in
the
future.
Otherwise
the
information
is
not
important
and
will
most
likely
be
eliminated.
After
more
than
a
school
year
(I
went
to
summer
school
for
Organic
Chemistry)
of
lab
reports
and
memorization
I
have
only
learned
many
pneumonic
tricks
and
how
to
explain
a
complex
process
in
few
words
as
possible.
The
area
in
which
my
writing
has
evolved
over
the
past
year
is
through
the
forms
of
writing
I
have
chosen
to
express
myself.
I
can
honestly
say
that
I
am
not
the
best
person
as
far
as
expressing
my
at
the
times
when
expression
of
feeling
is
necessary.
Even
as
a
child
I
was
known
for
being
the
solid
child
not
the
emotional
one.
My
mother,
an
avid
journal
writer
was
always
buying
beautiful
journals
for
my
sister
and
I
to-keep
our
thoughts
in.
My
younger
sister
would
finish
off
a
book
before
another
was
purchase
whereas
I
would
always
attempt
an
entry
on
the
first
day
after
receiving
the
book
and
then
never
write
anything
thereafter.
This
practice
resulted
in
numerous
journals
with
one
entry
basically
relaying
the
same
message
of
my
repeated
will
to
try
and
write
down
my
thoughts
though
it
never
ended
in
a
lucrative
endeavor.
This
past
year
to
my
mother's
delight
the
old
empty
journals
were
salvaged
from
the
depths
of
my
room
and
began
to
filled
one
after
the
other.
I
have
always
collected
numerous
little
tidbits
that
I
cut
from
magazines
and
newspapers
or
quotes
that
I
here
or
read
that
I
write
on
random
pieces
of
paper.
It
all
came
together
when
I
put
my
mini
collections
into
my
journals
and
then
started
recalling
why
I
had
chosen
that
particular
blurb
or
picture
of
a
rock
star
I
once
adored.
What
developed
was
the
my
mother
and
grandmother's
talent
for
recalling
stories
to
their
minute
detail
and
developing
anecdotes
upon
reflection
of
past
events.
Journal
writing
has
become
a
staple
of
my
daily
routine
and
enables
me
to
keep
things
in
perspective
and
organize
thoughts
that
are
often
jumbled
in
my
head.
My
summer
experience
was
one
of
great
learning
and
insight.
I
participated
in
an
internship
at
Pfizer
Inc.
world
headquarters
in
New
York
City.
I
did
not
really
have
much
of
an
opportunity
to
write,
most
of
my
work
was
mathematical
and
experimental.
But
I
had
to
give
periodic
presentations
to
many
officers
including
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
production.
I
noticed
that
many
of
the
other
interns
went
into
their
presentations
with
no
outline
or
notes
and
no
references
for
the
audience
use
as
guides.
For
each
presentation
I
spent
time
on
developing
a
clear
focused
outline
and
bulleted
point
guidelines
for
those
who
would
be
listening
to
me.
I
also
made
a
concerted
effort
to
understand
as
much
of
the
industry,
in
regards
to
production,
as
I
possibly
could
so
that
I
could
understand
and
field
any
questions
that
were
thrown
at
me.
In
my
final
review
by
my
supervisors
they
commented
that
in
addition
to
my
technical
knowledge
they
were
impressed
with
my
verbal
and
written
communication
skills.
As
we
have
heard
before
it
is
often
thought
that
college
students
leave
school
with
little
written
communication
skills.
I
feel
that
my
position
as
a
WA
has
enabled
me
to
be
comfortable
speaking
and
presenting
information
in
front
of
others.
I
have
also
developed
a
good
greater
organization
skills
which
allows
me
to
make
my
points
clear
and
concise
and
on
accordance
with
the
guidelines
which
I
had
handed
out
to
the
audience.
Overall
my
summer
experience
was
a
positive
one
which
resulted
in
a
JOB
OFFER!!!
Yes
I
am
excited.
So
there
is
my
year
in
a
nut
shell
(four
pages
really-
SORRY).
Though
my
style
as
a
writer
has
not
significantly
developed
over
the
past
year
my
communication
skills
have
been
sharpened
and
I
have
greater
confidence
in
my
abilities
since
testing
them
out
in
the
workforce.
I
feel
that
I
enter
this
year
with
an
eager
attitude
and
excited
to
act
as
WA
for
the
third
time.
Having
met
and
spent
a
week
of
orientation
with
the
class
of
students
that
I
will
work
with
I
feel
that
they
will
be
somewhat
of
a
challenge.
They
are
bright
and
interested
in
the
class
but
they
are
QUIET.
It
took
them
a
very
long
time
to
warm
up
to
each
other,
their
professors
and
myself.
I
think
in
the
beginning
that
conferences
will
be
a
challenge
but
I
feel
that
this
what
I
will
try
to
have
them
overcome.
Hear
we
go
again!!
