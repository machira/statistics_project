A
WriterOs
History
It
was
one
of
those
hot
nights
in
New
York
City
where
you
could
literally
feel
the
waves
of
heat
as
they
rose
off
the
asphalt.
As
I
descended
into
the
mouth
of
the
roaring
subway
all
I
could
think
of
was
when
I
would
get
home.
My
feet
throbbed
from
standing
for
hours
on
end
at
my
job.
The
bright
orange
train
seat
was
somewhat
comforting
and
helped
me
forget
the
stench
emanating
from
underground.
It
seemed
like
hours,
but
the
doors
finally
opened,
freeing
me
from
my
imprisonment.
I
was
greeted
by
a
gum
filled
flight
of
stairs
in
order
to
reach
the
elevator.
I
was
finally
in
front
of
the
sliding
doors
and
all
I
could
think
of
was
the
bed
awaiting
me
back
at
my
apartment.
The
last
thing
I
expected
was
to
see
my
old
classmate,
Jeremy,
from
middle
school
walking
out
of
the
elevator.
I
should
have
been
elated,
but
instead
I
just
felt
anger
because
this
would
be
another
delay
to
my
getting
home.
As
we
pretended
to
be
interested
in
each
otherOs
lives,
my
friend
asked
me
a
question
that
I
had
not
heard
in
a
while.
NSo
are
you
a
writer
yet?O
It
had
been
so
long
since
I
had
thought
of
my
childhood
dream
of
one
day
writing
a
novel.
JeremyOs
question
triggered
flashbacks
from
my
younger
years
and
got
me
thinking
about
my
experiences
in
writing.
Looking
back,
I
can
remember
the
difficulties
I
had
with
just
learning
how
to
write.
Being
of
a
Hispanic
background,
my
first
language
was
Spanish.
English
came
secondary
and
while
baffling
at
first,
many
years
of
bilingual
classes
finally
allowed
me
to
dominate
the
language.
As
I
grew
older,
I
recognized
the
importance
of
reading
and
how
it
could
strengthen
my
writing.
In
middle
school
I
read
Stephen
KingOs
Pet
Semetary.
I
was
immediately
fascinated
by
the
horror
genre.
It
was
then
that
I
decided
to
begin
writing
outside
of
the
classroom.
I
began
to
keep
a
journal,
writing
about
all
sorts
of
preteen
dilemmas
that
I
encountered.
Though
I
was
consistent
in
my
entries,
I
still
felt
that
there
was
more
that
I
could
do.
I
had
a
need
to
express
myself
further.
It
occurred
to
me
that
poetry
would
be
a
good
start.
I
thought
that
ambiguity
was
the
key
to
writing
good
poetry.
As
I
wrote
more,
however,
I
discovered
that
I
could
be
direct
and
still
achieve
the
same
emotional
effect.
Even
though
I
was
writing
poetry,
I
still
kept
reading
various
novels.
It
is
safe
to
say
that
my
reading
influenced
me
to
attempt
short
story
writing.
It
was
a
difficult
jump,
going
from
stanzas
to
paragraphs,
but
I
looked
forward
to
the
challenge.
Years
later
I
would
look
back
on
these
stories
and
think
they
were
mediocre,
but
while
in
middle
school
I
took
great
pride
in
what
I
had
written.
I
showed
many
of
my
friends
and
by
the
time
that
I
graduated
many
of
my
peers
wrote
in
my
yearbook
that
they
hoped
to
read
my
book
someday.
Perhaps
this
positive
feedback
boosted
my
ego
a
bit
too
much.
In
high
school
I
did
fairly
well
with
most
forms
of
writing
until
senior
year.
The
class
was
Advanced
Placement
English
and
the
teacher
was
Mr.
Brooks.
I
was
looking
forward
to
the
class
and
the
challenges
that
it
presented.
I
also
respected
Mr.
Brooks
as
a
teacher
and
wanted
him
to
respect
me
as
a
writer.
Most
of
my
academic
career
was
dominated
by
argument
papers
and
senior
year
of
high
school
was
no
different.
When
I
handed
in
my
first
paper
to
Mr.
Brooks
I
expected
that
I
would
be
graded
with
an
A
or
at
least
a
B.
This
was
not
the
case
and
I
ended
up
getting
COs
not
only
for
the
first
paper,
but
for
the
next
two
papers
to
come.
I
began
to
think
that
I
didnOt
understand
the
material
properly,
that
somehow
I
had
missed
the
message
of
what
I
was
expected
to
do
with
the
assignment.
I
decided
to
consult
with
Mr.
Brooks
and
found
that
he
wanted
more
analysis
and
fewer
examples
from
the
text.
It
was
then
that
I
discovered
probably
one
of
the
most
important
lessons
in
writing:
not
everyone
will
have
the
same
definition
for
certain
forms
of
writing.
While
Mr.
Brooks
thought
that
I
lacked
analysis,
my
history
teacher
enjoyed
my
analysis
and
just
wanted
more
examples.
While
I
mostly
wrote
argument
papers,
I
soon
discovered
that
different
subjects
required
different
forms
of
writing.
This
became
most
clear
to
me
in
college.
I
remember
experiencing
fear
when
I
entered
my
first
English
course
freshman
year.
It
was
Literary
Questions
and
when
I
had
initially
signed
up
for
it,
it
seemed
like
it
would
be
a
great
experience.
College
just
seemed
to
be
filled
with
possibilities.
That
summer
of
senior
year,
I
felt
like
I
had
the
whole
world
laid
out
before
me
in
a
span
of
four
years.
I
was
ready
to
make
the
best
of
it
not
only
socially,
but
academically.
I
feared
nothing,
at
least
until
Literary
Questions.
As
I
entered
the
room
in
Pardee,
I
began
to
feel
anxious.
First
off,
there
were
no
individual
tables,
but
instead
one
rectangular
table
with
chairs
around
it.
When
the
professor
finally
walked
in
I
realized
that
I
would
not
be
expected
to
just
read
two
books,
but
rather
about
eleven
for
the
semester.
When
I
got
my
first
paper
assignment
I
began
to
experience
anxiety.
I
was
expected
to
know
how
to
properly
search
and
utilize
research
in
my
paper.
This
was
a
skill
that
I
had
never
practiced
in
high
school.
I
had
to
write
ten
pages
whereas
in
high
school
most
papers
only
ran
two
to
three
pages.
All
of
this,
however,
was
small
stuff
compared
to
the
stress
which
I
experienced
with
the
execution
of
the
paper.
I
began
my
research
early
and
had
accumulated
a
variety
of
sources.
However,
a
few
days
before
the
paper
was
due
I
had
not
started.
For
years
I
had
used
procrastination
and
had
never
worried.
I
patted
myself
on
the
back
for
being
able
to
perform
tasks
at
the
last
minute
and
still
do
well.
I
thought
that
college
would
be
the
same.
It
wasnOt.
My
procrastination
cost
me
a
high
price
during
my
freshman
year.
During
finals
week
I
found
myself
pulling
all
nighters.
As
most
of
my
friends
went
to
bed
at
around
midnight,
I
would
be
up
until
two
or
even
three
in
the
morning
accompanied
by
a
lukewarm
cup
of
Wawa
coffee
and
my
unfinished
paper.
I
would
grow
envious
as
I
watched
my
friend
take
similar
classes,
but
start
her
work
early.
While
I
got
mostly
BOs
for
my
final
papers,
she
would
receive
AOs
because
she
refused
to
procrastinate.
I
slowly
came
to
realize
that
with
college
my
process
of
writing
would
also
have
to
change.
I
began
to
observe
what
made
me
anxious
about
writing
college
papers.
For
days
I
dwelled
and
tried
to
figure
out
this
problem.
It
dawned
on
me
that
this
way
my
writing
form.
For
some
reason,
somewhere
along
the
road
of
my
high
school
education
I
had
mentally
trained
myself
to
believe
that
last
minute
papers
were
ones
filled
with
emotions.
I
thought
that
the
most
profound
ideas
could
only
occur
to
me
while
I
was
in
a
state
of
panic
and
high
anxiety.
When
consulting
my
friend
she
claimed
the
opposite.
NI
donOt
understand
how
you
can
enjoy
that
rush.
I
feel
that
the
stress
would
almost
cause
me
to
make
more
mistakes
not
less,O
she
commented
to
me.
It
was
up
to
me
whether
I
wanted
to
always
feel
like
I
could
have
worked
harder
or
if
I
wanted
to
start
my
papers
early
and
actually
feel
like
I
accomplished
something.
Considering
the
expenses
that
come
with
a
college
education
and
the
sacrifices
which
my
parents
were
making
I
chose
the
latter
option.
I
promised
myself
that
sophomore
year
would
be
different.
A
year
in
college
had
taught
me
to
accept
change
and
learn
from
past
mistakes.
My
American
Literature
course
while
challenging,
still
was
one
of
my
easier
classes.
Other
classes
were
not
as
simple.
One
example
is
the
Revenge
and
Restoration
course
which
I
took.
I
am
not
sure
why,
but
I
felt
extremely
intimidated
by
the
course
load.
Perhaps
it
was
because
it
was
a
three
hundred
level
class
and
most
of
my
classmates
where
a
year
or
two
older
than
me.
I
found
it
difficult
to
raise
my
hand
without
feeling
self
conscious.
This
became
reflected
in
my
writing.
While
I
had
killed
many
of
my
procrastination
habits
I
still
left
some
of
my
writing
for
last
minute
because
I
felt
intimated.
The
course
became
a
hurdle
to
overcome
and
enjoy.
When
receiving
my
first
paper
back,
I
was
surprised
by
the
amount
of
feedback
I
had
received.
My
paper
seemed
to
have
been
drenched
in
red.
The
comments
were
direct
and
spared
no
feelings.
Most
of
my
life
when
a
professor
has
written
Nsee
meO
on
my
paper,
I
have
chosen
to
ignore
it.
I
would
tell
myself
that
I
would
just
do
better
the
next
time
around.
My
ego
often
interfered
in
my
ability
to
write
an
excellent
paper.
This
time,
however,
I
decided
that
seeing
the
professor
might
ease
some
of
my
frustration
and
feelings
of
incompetence.
For
the
first
time
in
a
while
I
began
to
see
the
professor
as
more
than
just
the
individual
who
would
determine
if
I
was
happy
or
angry
for
the
rest
of
the
day
after
receiving
a
graded
paper.
With
this
experience
came
a
well
learned
lesson
that
I
would
utilize
in
the
fall
semester
of
my
junior
year.
Writing
and
editing
go
hand
in
hand.
When
I
wrote
a
paper
in
high
school
there
was
no
need
to
reread
for
content.
Most
of
the
time,
I
was
just
looking
for
some
obvious
grammatical
mistakes.
With
the
continuation
of
my
college
education
I
came
to
discover
that
editing
is
essential.
The
papers
that
got
me
the
best
grades
were
those
that
I
had
not
only
revised
myself,
but
also
asked
others
to
revise.
Junior
year,
two
of
my
classes
focused
on
the
process
of
editing.
One
was
my
VAST
course
and
the
other
was
creative
writing.
In
VAST,
I
was
expected
to
read
articles
and
dissect
them
afterward.
Later
on,
when
I
was
assigned
papers
there
were
many
steps
before
the
finished
draft
was
handed
in.
I
would
first
have
to
create
a
proper
outline.
After
the
outline
was
created,
I
was
to
set
up
an
appointment
with
my
writing
associate
in
order
to
discuss
the
intentions
of
my
paper.
This
appointment
was
followed
by
a
follow
up
where
I
would
bring
in
a
preliminary
draft
of
my
paper.
The
paper
did
not
have
to
be
finished,
but
it
did
have
to
have
a
good
introductory
paragraph.
Once
my
writing
associate
gave
me
feedback
on
my
preliminary
draft,
I
was
given
up
to
a
week
to
finish
my
paper.
Finishing
before
the
day
it
was
due
was
my
goal.
This
way,
I
could
ask
my
friends
to
read
it
over
and
make
sure
that
everything
flowed
well
and
that
my
sentences
were
coherent.
Through
VAST
I
learned
to
appreciate
the
process
of
organizing
my
thoughts
before
I
put
them
down
on
paper.
My
creative
writing
class
taught
me
all
the
things
which
VAST
taught
me
and
more.
Where
in
VAST
I
learned
to
organize
my
thoughts
beforehand,
in
creative
writing
the
opposite
was
the
case.
I
was
given
tasks
where
I
was
to
free
write
for
about
ten
minutes
on
the
spot.
The
idea
was
to
not
stop
writing
and
never
look
back
on
what
I
had
already
written.
It
was
a
process
which
I
had
never
really
utilized
before,
but
learned
to
enjoy.
My
grade
did
not
depend
on
every
piece
of
work
I
wrote,
but
rather
on
a
final
portfolio.
The
final
portfolio
would
have
to
contain
all
of
my
polished
work
as
well
as
my
process
writing
(the
writing
which
I
had
begun
with).
Considering
that
the
portfolio
was
worth
three
quarters
of
my
grade
I
was
at
first
concerned
with
how
I
would
do.
Overtime,
however,
I
began
to
loosen
up.
Even
though
in
middle
school
I
enjoyed
writing
poems
and
short
stories,
I
had
dropped
the
habit
due
to
my
busy
schedule
in
college.
Creative
writing
forced
me
to
rekindle
my
passion
for
writing.
Each
week
I
would
have
a
new
task.
Whether
it
was
a
poem
to
write
or
a
plot
to
create,
it
never
felt
like
a
chore.
It
was
almost
relaxing
to
sit
in
front
of
my
laptop
with
headphones
on
and
just
tune
out
the
rest
of
the
world.
In
those
moments
all
that
mattered
was
the
blank
screen
before
me.
When
I
was
finally
finished
editing
and
revising
the
larger
task
would
lay
before
me:
Workshop.
The
concept
of
workshop
was
to
distribute
my
work
to
my
other
classmates.
They
would
read
it
over
and
when
it
was
my
time
to
present
I
would
read
the
first
few
pages.
Afterwards,
I
would
have
to
sit
in
my
chair
without
speaking
and
let
my
classmates
comment
on
what
they
enjoyed
and
what
they
disliked
about
my
work.
Of
course
I
had
let
friends
read
my
work
before,
but
having
it
publicized
made
me
feel
naked
and
vulnerable.
In
the
long
run
it
made
me
more
confident
of
my
work
and
challenged
me
to
take
risks
with
my
writing.
By
the
end
of
the
course
I
was
to
read
my
poem
at
a
class
reading.
After
months
of
practice
I
did
not
feel
embarrassed.
I
did
not
expect
the
surge
of
excitement
which
I
felt
as
I
read,
but
I
welcomed
it.
For
once
I
felt
like
an
actual
writer.
By
the
end
of
the
Fall
I
decided
to
declare
myself
a
Psychology
and
English
double
major.
If
it
were
not
for
my
classes
and
experiences
in
writing
I
may
have
never
done
it.
It
is
surprising
to
me
how
easily
I
was
willing
to
let
go
of
my
dream
of
being
a
writer
and
embrace
the
feeling
of
mediocrity.
I
look
back
at
the
journal
entries
from
middle
school
and
think
to
myself
that
I
have
improved
so
much.
I
was
not
always
happy
with
my
work,
but
I
have
learned
that
sometimes
unhappiness
could
be
one
of
the
greatest
gifts
to
a
writer.
It
allows
me
to
look
beyond
what
I
have
created
and
towards
the
potential
for
it
to
be
better.
Revising
is
not
the
destruction
of
passionate
thoughts
and
emotions,
but
rather
the
opportunity
to
have
the
reader
experience
those
same
feelings.
All
this
I
have
learned
through
being
a
writer.
But
perhaps
the
greatest
thing
I
learned
was
the
answer
to
JeremyOs
question.
I
could
not
respond
when
I
saw
him
in
the
Subway,
but
if
I
he
asked
me
now
if
I
was
a
writer
yet,
my
answer
would
be
simple.
I
am
a
writer.
