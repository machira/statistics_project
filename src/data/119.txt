Writing
Asst.
My
experiences
with
writing
sprouted
from
my
first
love,
reading.
My
parents
are
ingrained
with
the
stories
of
Horton
the
Elephant
and
Cookie
Monster
and
the
Cookie
Tree
which
I
forced
them
to
read
aloud
so
often
that
seventeen
years
later
they
can
still
recite
passages
from
memory.
Writing's
other
pull
stemmed
from
a
natural
talent
I
had
for
creating
stories.
I
remember
being
two
years
old
and
begging
my
mother
to
stay
and
listen
to
just
one
more
story
I
concocted
during
the
course
of
the
day.
It
seemed
only
natural
once
I
learned
to
write
in
first
grade
that
I
attempt
to
compose
my
own
stories.
The
advent
of
writing
lead
directly
to
attempts
at
illustrated
short
stories
in
first
and
second
grade.
I
quickly
realized
that
my
artistic
skills
were
below
par
but
my
stories
received
praise
from
my
teachers
and
another
big
fan,
my
baby
brother,
Daniel.
Dan
loved
hear
stories
at
night.
I
would
sit
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
and
start
with
"Once
upon
a
time.He
would
drift
off
to
sleep
after
about
two
stories
and
I'd
creep
back
to
my
own
bed,
the
remains
of
the
story
clinging
to
the
fringes
of
my
imagination.
It
was
somewhat
frustrating
to
be
unable
to
remember
the
stories
in
detail
the
next
day
and
my
frustration
acted
as
a
motivating
factor
to
write
my
stories
down.
I
began
with
an
old
blue
notebook
I
found
in
the
basement.
I
soon
filled
it
with
stories
of
princesses,
unicorns,
archeological
discoveries
and
dolphins.
I
remember
the
feel
of
cool
air
in
the
musty
basement
room
where
my
Dad
supposedly
had
his
at
home
office.
The
long
blue-green
shag
rug
tickled
and
scratched
the
back
of
the
my
legs
as
I
hunched,
cross-legged
on
the
floor,
clutching
a
pencil
and
trying
to
write
at
the
speed
of
my
zooming
imagination.
I
would
spend
hours
in
another
world,
and
every
night
have
a
new
story
to
reveal
to
my
brother.
The
fairy
tales
remained
and
I
eventually
expanded
to
poetry.
Inspired
by
a
house
my
uncle
had
in
the
woods
on
Edmonds
Island,
I
would
sit
in
an
old
chair
in
the
hardwood
living
room
with
a
green
pocket
notebook
and
write
poems.
Most
were
sad,
about
little
girls
and
their
dolls,
or
death.
I
realize
now
it
was
my
attempt
to
document
the
sorrow
I
felt
at
growing
up.
I
hated
losing
the
carefree
days
of
my
childhood
as
I
tried,
some
will
say
in
vain,
to
be
a
young
lady.
Between
poems
I
would
go
out
in
die
woods
and
look
for
snakes
and
salamanders,
proof
that
despite
my
efforts
to
be
a
lady
I
clung
to
my
childhood.
Fifth
grade
marked
a
milestone
in
my
writing
development,
I
made
a
new
friend
who
shared
my
passion
for
fairytales.
We
would
sit
for
hours
on
Saturdays
in
front
of
her
computer
and
write
stories
about
the
momentary
topic
of
fascination.
Aliens,
Atlantis,
sea
lions,
and
the
presidential
election
were
all
fair
game.
Often
these
marathon
sessions
would
spawn
individual
stories
which
we
would
write
alone
and
exchange
for
comments.
We
each
owned
a
notebook
full
of
bubbly
schoolgirl
scrawl
written
with
fluorescent
pink,
purple
or
teal
ink.
Often
we
wrote
stories
with
one
or
the
other
of
us
as
characters.
My
writing
during
this
time
strove
to
create
and
describe
the
perfect
world
that
would
exist
if
only
we
worked
hard
enough.
The
constant
writing
I
engaged
in
obviously
reflected
in
my
school
papers.
My
grade
school
largely
focused
on
creative
writing.
Stories
and
poems
were
encouraged,
as
were
excessively
pictorial
descriptions.
My
friend
and
I
found
that
easy
to
accomplish
in
light
of
our
weekend
activities
and
we
were
guaranteed
good
grades.
School
writing
took
very
little
creative
effort
and
I
began
to
focus
on
structure,
punctuation
and
spelling
in
order
to
challenge
myself.
Since
all
three
areas
were
weak
points
in
my
writing
I
started
using
outlines,
mapping
techniques,
dictionaries,
thesauruses
and
my
English
book
for
reference.
Unfortunately,
this
pulled
attention
from
my
creativity.
While
it
was
never
visible
in
my
school
work,
I
stopped
writing
fairy
tales
with
my
friend.
Instead
I
settled
for
editing
hers.
I
typed
the
stories
and
we
bound
them
in
binders.
Pages
of
white
paper
with
fantastic
stories
and
thankfully
very
few
technical
errors.
My
friend
later
received
a
writing
scholarship
to
her
college,
so
it
appears
we
both
benefited
from
the
years
of
storytelling.
High
school,
Seattle
Prep,
furthered
the
technical
direction
my
writing
was
headed.
I
graduated
from
blue
ball-point
pen
and
1980's
Apple
Computer
to
a
Gateway
2000
equipped
with
spell
check
and
thesaurus.
I
also
began
to
focus
on
global
issues
and
research
papers.
I
would
write
commentaries
and
persuasive
papers
about
war,
peace,
animal
rights
and
humans
moral
responsibilities.
I
found
that
I
enjoyed
research
and
consequently
wrote
dozens
of
well-informed
short
papers
which
astonished
teachers.
Usually,
after
the
fifth
or
sixth
week
of
reading
persuasive
papers
they
would
ask
if
I
ever
wrote
anything
creative
and
I
would
attempt
a
story.
It
unquestionably
flopped.
Although
I
was
still
able
to
vocally
create
a
story
for
entertainment,
a
connection
invariably
failed
when
I
wrote
the
story
on
paper
and
submitted
it
to
an
English
teacher.
It
sounded
strained,
false
and
lacking
the
passion
which
my
writing
and
storytelling
normally
contained.
I
settled
for
separating
the
two,
I
could
tell
a
story
and
write
a
proposal.
My
memories
of
high
school
writing
generally
evoke
images
of
sitting
in
the
plastic
folding
chair
at
our
computer.
Slices
of
untouched
apple
rapidly
browned
next
to
the
computer,
(remains
of
my
mother's
attempt
to
convince
me
to
eat)
complimenting
pages
of
scribbled
notes,
highlighted
photocopies
and
worm
eaten
books
from
one
of
the
back
shelves
of
the
downtown
Seattle
library.
I
would
lean
back
in
the
chair,
hold
a
page
up
to
the
small
light
and
return
my
focus
back
to
the
blue
screen.
Often
I
would
write
for
hours,
lose
track
of
time
and
end
up
with
a
final
copy
which
lacked
structure
but
contained
books
of
information.
At
that
point
I
would
print
out
the
entire
report
and
draw
arrows
through
paragraphs
to
re-align
them
in
a
coherent
fashion.
The
computer's
cut
and
paste
function
was
often
used
and
greatly
appreciated.
The
spellcheck
was
run,
then
it
was
time
to
proof
read.
I
would
spend
the
next
few
days
at
the
computer
trying
to
find
methods
to
link
paragraphs,
write
flowing
sentences,
correct
run-ons
and
continually
draw
the
reader
back
to
my
thesis.
Throughout
high
school
my
biggest
problem
was
the
time
consuming
nature
of
my
papers.
I
developed
into
a
process
writer
in
the
most
extreme
sense
of
the
word.
A
five
page
paper
incorporated
days
of
work
even
though
the
initial
writing
took
three
hours.
My
author
project
senior
year
was
a
twelve
page
masterpiece
which
took
two
months
to
complete.
I
focused
on
giving
myself
ample
time
to
write,
then
return
to
the
writing
to
find
and
correct
weak
spots.
My
parents,
brother,
friends
and
teachers
all
became
proofreaders.
Sometime
during
my
sophomore
year
of
high
school
my
teachers
recognized
an
ability
to
find
and
address
writing
errors
and
I
was
asked
to
be
a
Writing
Center
Assistant.
I
donated
three
lunches
weekly
to
reading
other
student
papers
and
making
suggestions
on
structure,
thesis
and
organization.
In
the
midst
of
my
obsession
with
process
writing
however,
my
boyfriend
at
the
time
spotted
and
focused
on
a
massive
gap
in
my
writing.
He
was
also
a
Writing
Center
Assistant
and
a
favorite
proofreader
of
my
papers.
He
started
by
editing
my
German
papers.
When
writing
in
a
foreign
language
it
was
easy
to
ignore
a
problem
I
had
with
my
writing,
and
until
he
started
reading
my
papers
for
other
classes
my
habitual
overuse
of
passive
voice
went
unrecognized.
Understandably,
it
was
difficult
to
spot
the
problem
in
my
own
papers
but
it
rapidly
became
a
focal
point
of
my
editing
process
and
a
problem
that
continues
to
haunt
me.
I
perpetually
incorporate
passive
voice
in
my
writing.
It
destroys
the
paper's
flow
and
disengages
the
writer.
As
a
consequence
of
my
attempt
to
squelch
the
problem,
my
editing
sessions
expanded
further.
I
would
write
a
paper,
reorganize
it
and
the
analyze
every
sentence
in
hopes
of
making
it
active.
My
boyfriend's
noting
of
the
problem
greatly
increased
my
ability
to
help
others
edit
their
papers.
Often
hard
to
read
papers
were
simply
written
in
such
a
way
that
the
reader
felt
like
an
observer
instead
of
an
active
participant.
Once
the
writer
and
I
discussed
thesis,
structure,
and
happiness
with
the
overall
piece
I
requested
they
spent
some
time
trying
to
eliminate
passive
voice.
Second
copies
greatly
improved
with
this
simple
idea.
The
Writing
center
itself
embodied
a
great
ideal
but
it
often
fell
short
of
the
goal.
The
writing
center
was
a
small
office
without
windows
and
despite
our
best
decorating
efforts,
largely
devoid
of
inspiration.
The
problem
with
editing
student
papers
was
complicated
by
the
students
own
self-consciousness
not
only
talking
to
one
of
the
WA's
but
also
the
knowledge
that
others
in
the
room
could
hear
the
conversations
taking
place.
The
incredibly
small
space
and
concrete
walls
resulted
in
a
magnified
echo.
Countless
times
I
wanted
to
take
the
student
out
to
another
location
where
I
hoped
they
would
feel
more
comfortable.
As
often
as
not,
I
would
offer
to
make
a
second
appointment
apart
from
the
writing
center
but
very
seldom
did
anyone
make
use
of
the
offer
unless
they
were
a
friend
who
felt
comfortable.
The
compassion
I
felt
for
the
students
who
visited
the
writing
center
largely
stemmed
from
my
own
understanding
of
the
private
nature
of
writing.
While
my
own
writing
seldom
received
negative
criticism,
I
felt
a
deep
attachment
to
my
work
and
great
concern
for
the
intended
audience.
I
never
took
my
journal
out
of
my
room,
my
fairy
tales
and
poems
were
never
exposed
to
any
eyes
but
those
of
my
friend
from
fifth
grade.
Only
writing
I
felt
safe
exposing,
persuasive
papers,
with
pages
of
facts
to
back
up
my
opinions,
left
the
confines
of
my
bedroom
or
the
computer
room.
When
I
reached
college
my
writing
continued
to
evolve.
The
first
two
papers
I
wrote
for
my
FYS
class
were
submitted
simultaneously
with
only
a
number
for
identification
to
remove
any
chance
of
teacher
basis.
One
received
an
"A,"
the
other
a
"D."
That
was
the
first
blatant
criticism
my
writing
received,
however
it
certainly
was
not
the
last.
My
first
semester
of
college
I
quickly
learned
how
to
write
a
paper
that
appealed
to
different
types
of
audiences.
My
FYS
teacher
wanted
business
related
papers,
facts,
figures
and
concise
writing.
My
politics
professors
wanted
facts,
history
and
conclusions
that
could
be
better
described
as
predictions.
My
first
literature
class
focused
on
poetry
and
plays.
Amazingly
I
transferred
my
writing
back
to
the
pictorial
descriptive
writing
expected
in
that
class.
Yet,
each
type
of
writing
was
reflected
in
the
other
classes
and
resulted
in
a
good
mixture.
My
business
and
politics
papers
contained
volumes
of
facts
but
also
utilized
a
full
vocabulary
and
variety
of
writing
styles.
My
English
papers
focused
on
descriptions
and
as
a
result
of
the
business
class
the
descriptions
remained
brief.
This
allowed
for
a
greater
expansion
of
ideas
in
the
assigned
number
of
pages.
College
resulted
in
a
much
more
integrated
writer.
I
learned
both
to
separate
styles
depending
on
the
audience
and
balance
the
aspects
of
good
writing.
My
writing
assistant
for
my
FYS
was
a
superb
resource
in
helping
to
establish
that
balance.
College
writing
also
allowed
me
to
integrate
my
fairytales
and
school
writing.
Living
on
campus
I
could
not
distinguish
my
writing
by
location.
Instead
I
adapted
by
distinguishing
between
handwritten
work
and
that
done
on
my
laptop.
School
related
assignments
began
and
ended
on
my
little
Toshiba
laptop.
Always
saved
on
a
floppy
disk,
they
traveled
to
the
library
with
the
computer,
and
often
were
only
printed
once
or
twice.
Paper
became
a
treasured
commodity
when
I
had
to
pay
for
it
out
of
my
own
paycheck.
I
learned
to
print
on
both
sides
of
the
paper
which
would
often
confuse
the
proofreaders
of
my
first
few
drafts
when
they
would
flip
a
page
over
and
find
a
different
paper
printed
on
the
other
side.
Even
now,
sitting
in
my
kitchen
at
home,
writing
on
this
computer,
transports
me
back
to
my
blue
dorm
room
with
my
roommate
studying
biology
on
the
bed
near
the
window.
I
heavily
associated
my
school
writing
with
this
laptop.
As
for
my
fairytales
that
stopped
in
high
school,
they
reappeared
in
a
sense
part
way
through
the
school
year.
I
started
having
nightmares.
In
an
attempt
to
purge
my
mind
of
repetitive
nightmares
I
wrote
them
down
in
a
small
brown
notebook.
That
book
sat
on
the
shelf
above
my
bed
at
school
and
now
it
lays
on
the
table
near
my
bed.
Over
the
course
of
the
year
the
book
became
home
to
more
than
nightmares,
I
used
it
as
a
journal,
and
even
a
place
for
the
occasional
poem.
I
am
beginning
to
realize
that
writing
is
a
compilation
of
both
expected
school
writing
and
the
writing
which
I
do
from
the
heart
with
a
message
that
simply
must
be
expressed.
Amusingly,
I
find
my
writing
completing
a
full
circle
as
I
predict
the
course
of
this
year.
I
expect
to
begin
writing
short
stories
and
journals,
as
I
did
as
a
child.
College
writing
however
requires
something
more
mature
and
structured.
I
hear
echoes
of
my
years
at
Seattle
Prep
in
that
expectation.
Connected
to
that
time
in
my
life,
I
will
again
be
reading
the
papers
of
other
students,
making
suggestions
and
learning
new
aspects
of
writing
though
the
experience.
Perhaps
this
year
with
be
the
culmination
of
nineteen
years
of
storytelling
and
studying.
