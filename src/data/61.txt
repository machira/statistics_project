My
Writing
Journal
WA
summer
project
August

September

1986
This
is
my
first
entry
into
my
fifth
grade
daily
journal.
The
topic
is
to
introduce
myself
and
describe
what
I
like
to
read
and
write.
My
name
is
Carolyn
Amy
Leder,
but
my
nickname,
which
I
like
better,
is
Carrie.
I
have
one
sister,
one
brother,
one
mom,
one
dad,
and
no
pets.
I
live
on
78
Whitehall
Road,
Rockville
Centre
in
a
new
house
my
family
and
I
just
moved
into
this
summer.
My
new
house
is
still
in
the
Baldwin
School
District
and
even
though
I
do
not
really
live
in
Baldwin,
my
mom
says
I
can
still
go
to
Plaza
Elementary
School.
I
always
liked
to
read,
especially
the
Babysitter's
Club
and
Nancy
Drew
books.
I
only
read
books
about
girls
my
age
or
older,
not
boys.
I
always
liked
to
write
too.
In
my
diary
I
write
about
what
I
think.
My
teacher
in
third
grade,
Mrs.
Schraft,
let
each
student
pick
a
story
topic
each
wee.
Once
it
was
my
turn
to
pick
the
topic
and
I
picked
The
Day
the
Blue
Alien
Invaded
the
Earth.
Aliens,
monsters,
Thanksgiving,
Christmas,
and
dinosaurs
were
the
most
used
ideas
.
We
would
write
our
stories
with
a
pencil
and
print
them.
We
practiced
script
each
day
and
blue
ink
was
saved
for
fourth
grade.
I
remember
first
learning
slanted
loops,
swirls,
and
spirals
in
upper
and
lower
case
script
in
second
grade!
In
third
grade,
Mrs.
Schraft
corrected
the
way
I
held
my
pen.
My
script
would
slant
from
the
upper
left
to
the
lower
right
instead
of
the
right
way.
Last
year
a
man
called
Mr.
Rogers
read
my
stories
and
let
me
go
to
a
different
school
two
days
a
week
for
PAG.
I
think
it
means
Program
for
the
Academically
Gifted,
but
all
we
did
was
math
and
I
missed
my
friends.
I
cannot
wait
to
write
stories
and
practice
for
the
fifth
grade
writing
test!
(Even
though
I
am
nervous).
Oh,
I
have
permed
blonde
hair,
blue
eyes,
and
sit
in
the
second
row
next
to
the
window.
The
years
1986
and
1987,
my
fifth
year
of
elementary
school,
established
the
core
of
my
personal
writing
process.
The
previous
journal
entry
is
a
re-created
version
of
my
nine
and
a
half
year-old
mentality.
At
that
age
in
fifth
grade,
I
began
to
create,
to
think,
to
write,
and
to
revise.
The
woman
who
first
fueled
my
creative
energy
was
Mrs.
Artz.
Tall
and
thin
with
a
bowl
haircut,
Mrs.
Artz
instructed
an
intensified
writing
class.
Her
goal
was
to
prepare
her
students
for
the
end
of
the
year
writing
test
upon
which
our
futures
depended.
Or
at
least
it
seemed
that
way
at
the
time.
Mrs.
Artz's
initial
step
to
ease
our
way
into
the
wonderful
world
of
writing
was
a
daily
journal.
While
some
moaned
and
groaned
at
the
thought
of
writing
everyday,
I
smiled
at
the
opportunity.
For
the
first
time
in
my
short
history,
I
was
to
record
my
thoughts
on
paper
for
academic
purposes,
not
just
for
personal
pleasure.
The
topics
ranged
from
poems
about
Spring
to
how
I
felt
about
departmentalization
to
explaining
my
many
trials
and
tribulations
attempting
to
ride
a
two-wheeled
bicycle.
They
were
personal
entries,
but
unlike
my
dear
diary,
every
two
weeks
Mrs.
Artz
would
read
each
entry
and
comment.
She
probably
collected
journals
to
check
on
the
class
slackers
and
she
probably
did
not
read
every
entry.
Nevertheless,
even
with
the
knowledge
that
a
person
of
higher
authority
might
read
about
me,
I
began
to
express
myself
freely
on
paper.
My
devotion
and
honesty
won
an
encouraging
comment
on
each
page.
Mrs.
Artz's
support
gave
me
the
confidence
to
express
myself
in
my
stories.
The
class
slogan
to
writing
stories
had
the
acronym
I
BEAR:
I
for
identifying
the
topic;
B
equaled
brainstorming
for
ideas;
E
stood
for
evaluating
those
ideas;
A
meant
acting
on
or
using
your
ideas;
and
R
entailed
revising
those
ideas.
Mrs.
Artz
would
pass
out
photocopied
dittos
with
the
initials
I
BEAR
printed
in
the
stomach
of
overstuffed
teddy
bears
to
help
her
students
remember.
This
slogan
became
the
backbone
of
my
writing
process.
In
fifth
grade,
one-hundred
percent
of
my
energy
focused
on
following
this
process
to
an
exact
science.
First,
Mrs.
Artz
would
assign
a
topic
or
sometimes
have
two
from
which
I
could
chose.
I
would
identify
the
topic.
For
example,
if
I
was
to
shrink
or
grow,
which
one,
why,
and
to
what
height.
Next,
I
brainstormed
for
ideas
and
wrote
them
down
on
scrap
paper.
It
so
happens
that
in
fifth
grade
I
thought
shrinking
to
the
height
of
Alice
of
the
infamous
Disney
movie
Alice
in
Wonderland
was
the
best
thing
since
sliced
bread.
I
wanted
to
roam,
as
she
did,
through
beautiful
roses
and
lilies,
and
to
meet
a
pompous
poetic
caterpillar.
Once
I
thought
of
the
Alice
in
Wonderland
idea,
I
printed
a
double-spaced
story
using
a
number
two
pencil
on
yellow-lined
paper.
That
rough
draft
had
plenty
of
space
for
corrections,
and
after
it
was
complete,
it
would
be
revised
by
myself,
Mrs.
Artz,
and
if
we
happened
to
be
working
in
groups,
by
other
students.
Next,
I
got
fresh
white-lined
paper
and
a
blue
pen
to
re-copy
the
revised
rendition
in
script.
A
bottle
of
white-out
found
its
way
into
my
desk
supplies
to
hide
any
penmanship
or
spelling
errors
on
the
final
copy.
When
I
finished
My
Day
Being
Five
Inches
in
Wonderland,
the
last
step
of
the
process
was
to
staple
both
copies
along
with
any
brainstorming
notes
together
in
the
upper
left-hand
corner.
I
handed
it
in
and
it
was
returned
graded
on
a
scale
of
fifteen
or
twenty.
I
knew
a
roundabout
grade
by
reflecting
on
the
amount
of
time
put
into
the
story.
Mrs.
Artz
was
more
concerned
about
instilling
the
process
than
in
grading
the
finished
product.
When
my
stories
were
continuously
mounted
and
hung
on
the
wall,
I
learned
that
hard
work
and
diligence
pays
off,
maybe
not
at
first,
but
eventually.
After
fifth
grade,
my
English
teachers
spent
the
majority
of
time
on
grammar.
In
the
seventh
and
eight
grades,
I
was
taught
the
difference
between
simple,
complex,
and
compound
sentences,
between
gerunds
and
participles,
and
even
dabbled
in
the
world
of
dangling
modifiers.
My
seventh-grade,
hollow-eyed,
black-haired,
witch-like
English
teacher
Ms.
Sher
carved
a
preposition
song
(above,
across,
along,
amid,
among,
around,
at,
behind,
etc.)
into
my
skull.
However
when
writing,
my
mind
tends
to
forget
important
grammatical
lessons.
Between
1989
and
1994,
my
junior
high
and
high
school
years,
I
got
to
experience
the
teaching
style
of
six
different
English
teachers.
While
offering
support,
encouragement
and
their
own
angle
on
grammar
and
literature,
all
six
seemed
to
notice
my
tendency
to
concentrate
on
content
rather
than
on
the
rules
of
grammar.
I
focused
my
attention
on
the
ideas
behind
the
loss
of
personal
freedom
in
1984,
the
underlying
psyche
of
Captain
Ahab
in
Mobv
Dick,
and
the
relationship
of
Catherine
and
Heathcliff
in
Wutherinq
Heights.
My
papers
and
essays
reflected
my
interest
in
idea
rather
than
grammar.
I
received
A's
and
B's,
yet
my
teachers
would
point
out
my
fetish
with
run-on
sentences,
fragments,
and
wordy
paragraphs.
In
other
words,
I
ignored
some
rules
of
grammar
and
it
took
me
many
words
to
say
anything.
Regardless
of
my
flaws,
I
began
to
learn
about
the
world
of
computers.
Unfortunately,
my
typing,
which
misplaced
commas,
periods,
and
letters,
added
to
my
grammatical
errors.
Computers
were
supposed
to
be
the
easy
way
out
of
writing
long-hand.
However,
my
capability
lacked
in
speed
which
resulted
in
me
saving
computer
usage
only
for
social
studies
term
papers.
Nevertheless
Social
Studies
was
effected
by
computers
and
the
I
BEAR
writing
process.
After
taking
notes
on
the
atomic
bomb
on
Hiroshima,
I
wrote
a
rough
draft,
transferred
it
onto
the
computer
screen,
fixed
mistakes,
and
then
printed
out
the
corrected
typed
version.
After
revising
the
printed
copy,
my
fingers,
arms,
eyes,
and
brain
were
exhausted.
My
eleventh
grade
typing
course
helped
increase
the
speed
with
which
I
could
type.
My
written
rough
draft
turned
into
a
computer
draft
and
the
computer
became
my
necessity.
My
elementary
and
secondary
education
had
prepared
me
for
college.
First
semester,
I
used
the
I
BEAR
.method
on
all
my
papers.
Fortunately,
I
had
the
time
to
focus
my
attention
on
schoolwork.
However,
second
semester,
I
started
becoming
involved
in
activities
and
found
less
time
to
accomplish
the
work
I
needed
to,
how
I
wanted
to.
This
realization
hit
me
over
the
head
in
my
first-year
writing
course
which
demanded
a
majority
of
my
time
and
energy.
We
had
three
papers
throughout
the
semester
on
analyzing
commercials.
I
had
to
hand
in
typed
double-spaced
drafts
with
an
abundance
of
copies
to
be
reviewed
by
peers,
myself,
and
the
professor.
After
reviewing
the
corrections,
we
were
to
produce
a
final
copy.
The
process
went
more
in-depth
as
to
the
grammatical
lessons
and
the
rules
of
writing,
but
it
reminds
me
of
my
fifth
grade
Plaza
Elementary
School
class.
It
was
not
until
writing
this
essay
was
I
aware
of
the
similarities
between
the
process
both
my
freshmen
year
writing
professor
and
my
fifth
grade
teacher
attempted
to
establish.
My
first-year
writing
experience
refreshened
my
memory
and
forced
me
to
realize
that
there
is
a
method
to
my
madness:
a
seven-year
history
of
following
an
established
process
and
getting
good
grades.
July
19,
1996
Seven
pages.
How
am
I
going
to
write
seven
pages
about
my
history
as
a
writer
while
I
live
in
party
town
Ocean
City,
MD.
?
In
the
middle
of
the
summer,
living
with
four
other
girls,
being
lazy,
and
just
hangin'
out?
I
don't
even
know
if
we
have
paper,
let
alone
a
computer
where
I
could
organize
my
first
draft.
Not
that
I
wouldn't
enjoy
some
peace
and
quiet
to
think
back
and
reflect
on
my
history
with
writing.
What
is
my
first
memory
of
writing?
Plaza-
third
grade,
those
crazy
stories
we
wrote
with
Mrs.
Schraft,
my
Nadia
Kominich
book
report
where
I
dressed
up
as
a
gymnast
and
read
my
report,
my
fourth
grade
stint
at
PAG-
oh
Mrs.
Artz,
fifth
grade,
the
entire
I
BEAR
process.
I
could
write
about
that.
But
how
can
I
narrow
my
history
down?
Should
I
write
a
formal
narrative
or
can
I
be
creative?
I
should
try
and
find
a
clean
sheet
of
paper.
I'm
excited
about
writing
about
me.
(And
nervous).
