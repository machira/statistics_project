Returning
WA
Essay
A
Change
in
Writing
Perspective
When
I
first
began
contemplating
my
OgrowthO
as
a
writer
over
the
last
year,
I
had
difficulty
reflecting
on
how
my
writing
has
specifically
changed
in
just
one
short
year.
Yet,
when
I
began
to
really
reflect
on
all
that
has
happened
to
me
in
the
past
year,
between
my
role
as
a
WA,
my
expanded
experience
writing
in
different
courses
and
genres
and
studying
abroad
in
a
different
country
with
different
writing
expectations,
I
realized
that
there
were
many
reasons
why
my
writing
should
have
changed.
While
these
events
all
certainly
had
a
cumulative
effect
on
my
writing
over
the
past
year,
I
believe
that
my
experience
as
a
WA,
a
role
that
forced
me
to
examine
writers
and
the
process
of
writing
in
much
more
detail
than
I
ever
have
before,
truly
altered
my
perception
of
the
writing
process.
I
admit
I
was
very
nervous
when
I
first
began
working
as
a
WA.
Yes,
I
have
had
years
of
writing
experience
in
various
subjects
with
many
different
teachers
and
I
felt
fairly
knowledgeable
about
the
writing
basics.
But
what
made
me
experienced
and
even
good
enough
to
have
the
authority
to
instruct
other
students
on
how
to
write?
I
assumed
that
the
students
would
have
no
interest
in
Omy
opinion,O
not
treat
me
as
a
writing
authority
(I
mean,
why
should
they
really?)
and
most
frighteningly,
have
more
knowledge
about
the
writing
process
than
I
would.
Well,
fortunately
my
natural
instinct
took
hold
as
soon
as
I
began
my
first
set
of
meetings.
My
confidence
in
my
own
abilities
grew
with
each
student
meeting
and
as
the
semester
progressed
I
finally
realized
that
I
was
only
there
to
give
the
students
a
second
opinion
on
their
writing
with
the
intention
of
improvement.
Suddenly
I
realized
that
I
actually
have
learned
something
about
writing
over
my
educational
course.
Though
I
do
not
notice
a
concrete
change
in
my
own
writing,
I
realized
that
my
perspective
on
the
whole
writing
process
has
been
drastically
altered
over
the
past
year,
a
change
in
outlook
that
has
been
predominantly
precipitated
by
my
experience
as
a
WA.
Being
a
WA
forced
me
to
be
completely
unbiased
in
my
critical
assessment
of
the
writing
process.
It
made
me
look
at
preliminary
and
even
nearly
polished
pieces
of
writing
with
the
only
aim
of
helping
the
writers
understand
how
to
make
their
work
better.
Whereas
I
had
previously
been
so
nervous
about
what
to
say
and
how
to
pass
my
own
judgment
about
personal
pieces
to
these
young
writers,
I
began
to
realize
the
beauty
and
even
the
uniqueness
of
my
position:
I
existed
as
a
medium
between
student
and
teacher,
someone
to
offer
advice,
critique
and
comment
in
a
less
intimidating
atmosphere.
I
do
not
want
to
say
that
the
writing
that
I
encountered
was
bad,
it
was
just
in
a
less
experienced
form
than
I
expected.
I
found
myself
explaining
the
basics
of
essay
writing
to
the
students
very
oftenEand
not
because
I
felt
the
need
to
lecture
them
on
the
basic
methods
of
simple
essay
writing,
but
because
I
suddenly
realized
that
employing
such
rules
would
actually
make
it
much
more
coherent.
Beginning
at
a
more
simplified
level
of
writing
and
embracing
writers
of
varying
abilities,
experiences
and
backgrounds
almost
helped
me
to
approach
the
writing
process
from
a
more
simplified
perspective
than
I
have
been
used
to.
Yet,
I
thus
found
that
when
I
revised
my
own
work
after
writing,
I
began
to
re-approach
it
in
the
same
style
as
I
did
with
the
students:
I
looked
more
closely
at
the
development
of
my
thesis,
how
it
was
incorporated
through
the
essay,
whether
or
not
I
had
a
proper
succession
of
body
paragraphs,
and
overall,
if
the
entire
essay
was
clear
and
coherent.
Concentrating
on
the
basics
of
my
work
and
employing
the
advice
that
I
had
given
to
my
students
on
myself
enabled
me
to
understand
my
own
points
I
was
trying
to
make
that
much
better.
As
helpful
and
beneficial
that
being
a
WA
has
been
to
my
own
writing,
the
unique
position
that
it
has
placed
me
in
has
also
presented
me
with
an
entirely
different
and
more
critical
perspective
on
the
writing
process.
Since
I
was
put
in
a
position
of
authority
but
was
still
just
a
student
myself,
it
made
it
that
much
more
difficult
for
me
to
express
my
opinions
on
the
writing
process
with
convincing
authority.
Writing
is
an
art
that,
unlike
the
sciences,
really
does
not
maintain
an
Oabsolute
formal
standard,O
which
is
both
its
beauty
and
its
difficulty.
As
the
semester
wore
on,
I
found
it
almost
increasingly
difficult
to
delineate
the
differences
between
good
and
bad
writing
and
to
more
closely
bind
to
or
rebel
against
the
more
conventional
standards
of
the
Oeducational
writing
system.O
For
example,
I
worked
with
one
student
who
was
quite
a
talented
writer
but
always
began
his
essays
in
narrative
form
and
generally
deviated
from
the
typical
OeducationalO
essay
format.
Yet,
he
was
always
able
to
get
his
point
across
very
clearly
and
convincingly.
Thus,
I
felt
that
much
more
confined
by
my
role
as
an
OauthoritativeO
student
writer
when
I
met
with
him.
I
felt
compelled
to
impose
the
more
acceptable
and
standard
writing
approaches
to
his
work
(and
thus
force
him
to
almost
completely
alter
his
essay)
but
I
thought
that
the
artistic
liberties
that
he
took
only
emphasized
his
control
over
the
writing
process.
And
since
I
was
not
his
teacher
and
was
not
able
to
set
my
own
standard
of
what
I
would
deem
as
acceptable
Ogood
student
writing,O
I
could
only
recommend
his
conformation
to
a
more
standard
approach.
LuOs
essay
OProfessing
Multiculturalism:
The
Politics
of
Style
in
the
Contact
ZoneO
seems
to
comment
on
a
similar
issue
in
the
instruction
of
modern-day
student
writing,
specifically
in
this
OproblemO
with
dealing
with
artistic
liberties.
Lu
astutely
discusses
the
undefined
problem
distinguishing
between
OstudentO
and
OrealO
writers
and
why
and
when
it
is
acceptable
for
students
to
embrace
the
artistic
liberties
that
so
many
Oreal
writersO
are
praised
for,
even
and
especially
when
they
deviate
from
the
conventional
writing
standards
that
are
programmed
into
the
studentsO
educational
instruction.
I
have
now
read
this
article
twice:
once
before
being
a
WA
and
once
after
my
first
WA-ing
experience;
I
can
tell
that
my
writing
perspective
has
changed
over
the
last
year
by
my
ability
to
actually
relate
to
LuOs
presented
issue
at
hand.
Lu
tries
to
temporarily
solve
the
students
non-identity
as
a
OrealO
writer
by
labeling
him/her
as
OemergingO
but
she
still
does
not
answer
the
essential
issue
of
where
to
draw
the
line
between
Ogood/badO
and
Oright/wrongO
writing
in
the
student
world.
I
know
and
have
always
known
that
essay
writing
is
something
that
is
naturally
arbitrary,
even
though
good
writing
must
naturally
contain
the
bare,
essential
systematic
elements
to
make
it
coherent.
Students
of
writing
so
often
alter
their
writing
style
based
on
their
professorsO
standards.
This
lack
of
an
absolute
writing
technique/style
has
always
bothered
me
a
bit
because
it
does
not
leave
OemergingO
writers
much
to
concretely
aspire
to,
but
it
thus
leaves
that
much
more
room
for
a
self-defining
style.
After
being
a
WA,
I
finally
got
to
experience
this
OproblemO
of
analyzing
the
writing
process
from
the
opposite
perspective
of
that
which
I
am
used
to-
that
of
the
writing
authority
and
critic.
I
was
suddenly
aware
of
the
power
that
I
held
over
this
creative
process
but,
as
only
the
middle-man
between
student
and
teacher,
I
was
only
that
much
more
painfully
aware
of
how
my
influence
and
opinion
could
drastically
conflict
with
the
studentsO.
It
was
often
a
very
difficult
situation
to
be
in.
I
especially
became
much
more
aware
of
the
separation
between
student
and
teacher
and
the
difficulty
of
my
Omiddle-manO
position
during
my
semesterOs
experience
as
a
WA
when
I
held
conflicting
views
with
an
authority.
In
the
beginning
of
my
WA
experience,
I
remember
one
of
the
WA
instructors
commenting
on
the
unique
relationship
that
we
would
probably
develop
throughout
the
semester
with
the
professor
of
the
class
we
were
WA-ing.
Even
though
the
professor
was
clearly
the
authority
of
his/her
class,
as
students
well
trained
in
the
details
of
essay-writing,
we
may
have
more
knowledge
and
even
inherent
control
on
the
ways
of
essay
writing
than
the
professor,
the
WA
instructor
noted.
I
WA-ed
for
a
first-year
seminar
about
evolution
that
was
taught
by
a
physics
professor.
Over
the
course
of
the
semester,
we
developed
a
good
working
relationship
but
I
soon
became
all
too
aware
of
the
differences
in
our
writing
standards.
Sometimes
he
would
share
his
opinions
on
his
studentsO
essays
with
me,
only
to
discover
that
my
opinions
on
what
it
took
to
make
a
solid,
strong,
coherent
essay
differed
from
his.
He
seemed
to
focus
more
on
the
amount
of
information
provided
in
an
essay
rather
than
its
presentation
in
the
most
stylistically
coherent
way.
Sometimes
I
felt
that
my
hard
work
trying
to
make
the
students
find
the
medium
between
form
and
content
was
not
being
emphasized
and
thus
rewarded
as
much
in
the
classroom,
making
my
role
seem
that
much
more
ineffective
and
even
unnecessary.
Was
this
issue
mainly
due
to
the
differences
between
the
arts
and
the
sciences?
Or
can
it
be
attributed
to
the
OproblemsO
of
writingEand
teaching
writing?
I
even
had
a
similar
experience
with
critical
essay
writing
in
a
non-English
subject
this
past
spring
semester.
I
was
supposed
to
write
an
essay
about
how
Canadian
literature
encompassed
Canadian
national
identity
for
my
Canadian
Studies
class,
a
course
that
analyzed
many
different
aspects
of
one
culture.
Before
we
handed
in
our
essays,
one
of
the
students
in
my
class
asked
the
professor
about
some
specific
formality
on
writing
a
literary
analysis.
My
professor
confessed
that
as
an
anthropology
specialist,
he
just
did
not
know
much
about
the
specifics
of
literature
analysis
and
just
to
Ntry
your
best.O
I
at
first
felt
to
be
at
an
advantage
as
an
English
major
but
I
found
it
difficult
not
to
question
my
professorOs
authority
as
a
suitable
critic
of
my
hard
work.
I
ended
up
doing
fine
on
my
essay
but
I
felt
that
so
much
of
my
intricate
analyses
were
ignored
or
unappreciated,
perhaps
a
result
of
my
professorOs
self-confessed
lack
of
literature
analysis
knowledge
or
my
awareness
of
his
lack
of
knowledge.
It
just
confirmed
my
increased
awareness
of
the
lack
of
an
absolute
writing
standard
that
result
in
so
many
varying
perspectives
and
opinions.
Studying
abroad
in
another
country
for
half
a
year,
especially
an
English-speaking
one
additionally
had
a
significant
impact
on
my
writing
and
writing
perspective.
Even
though
the
British
writing
system
is
not
that
different
from
the
American
system,
I
found
that
the
British
students
shared
different
values
on
the
creation
and
interpretation
of
their
work.
I
spent
hours
and
even
days
carefully
constructing
my
first
essay
for
my
English
course,
being
particularly
worried
about
making
a
strong
first
impression
in
a
new
culture.
Once
I
turned
in
the
essay,
I
eagerly
awaited
its
return,
curious
to
note
if
my
writing
style
had
a
different
outcome/impact
in
a
different
educational
system.
It
not
only
took
weeks
for
my
essay
to
be
returned
to
me,
but
I
received
it
back
with
minimal
comments,
mostly
general
remarks
highlighting
its
strengths
and
weaknesses.
I
was
frustrated
by
this
end
result
and
felt
incomplete,
desiring
to
discuss
my
paper
more
at
length.
After
spending
more
time
with
the
British
educational
system
and
having
more
essay
writing
(and
receiving)
experience,
I
soon
realized
that
the
British
students
did
not
seem
to
have
the
same
need
to
know
each
and
every
formality
of
what
was
right
and
wrong
about
essay-writing.
Or
was
the
American
tendency
to
walk
the
students
through
a
more
step-by-step
approach,
highlighting
all
the
flaws
and
strengths,
an
obsession
of
ours
that
hindered
a
more
creative
independence?
I
found
that
the
British
students
also
shared
a
fascination
in
my
role
as
a
Owriting
associate,O
a
link
between
student
and
teacher
that
was
compulsory
for
all
students
at
some
point
in
their
university
career,
rather
than
need-based.
Having
to
explain
multiple
times
what
my
role
as
a
WA
encompassed
and
that
it
was
more
of
a
Osecond
opinionO
about
a
studentOs
writing
rather
than
a
writing
critic
or
tutor,
only
made
me
appreciate
my
writing
upbringing
that
much
more.
Yet
it
also
increased
my
awareness
on
the
cross-cultural
writing
differences
and
how
there
still
does
not
seem
to
be
an
Oabsolute
writing
standard.O
So
in
terms
of
my
expectations
for
this
upcoming
year,
I
aim
to
be
continually
conscious
of
how
to
bridge
the
gap
between
OemergingO
writers
and
OrealO
writers
and
how
to
make
such
a
transition
using
both
stylistic
and
more
formative
writing
methods.
I
had
a
number
of
rewarding
experiences
with
the
students
after
only
giving
them
what
I
believed
to
be
simple
and
straightforward
advice,
making
me
realize
the
uniqueness
of
my
position
as
this
Omiddle-manO
between
student
and
teacher.
My
main
advice
for
new
WAs
would
be
to
be
confident
with
your
own
writing
abilities;
there
is
a
reason
you
are
in
the
position
you
are
in
and
it
all
becomes
that
much
clearer
when
you
step
outside
your
own
writing
and
realm
of
familiarity.
Yet,
overall,
I
feel
that
my
need
to
question
and
even
challenge
the
writing
process
is
a
change
that
has
developed
over
the
last
year
that
I
will
only
be
all
the
more
motivated
to
find
an
answer
to
in
my
upcoming
writing
(and
mentoring)
experiences.
