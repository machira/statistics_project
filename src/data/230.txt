WA
assignment
August
27,
1999
Over
the
past
year
I
have
had
many
interesting
experiences
in
my
position
as
a
Writing
Associate.
At
times
I
felt
wonderful
about
the
improvements
which
my
students
had
made
in
their
writing.
However,
there
were
also
times
when
I
became
frustrated
and
rather
annoyed
due
to
a
lack
of
cooperation.
As
the
1998-99
school
year
came
to
a
close,
I
came
to
the
conclusion
that
I
should
not
expect
each
student
to
be
a
perfect
writer,
and
that
I
should
acknowledge
the
fact
that
each
individual
student
has
had
a
different
writing
past
which
has
shaped
their
style.
Thus,
I
decided
that
I
would
take
a
new
approach
to
my
position
as
a
WA
which
involved
addressing
the
problematic
areas
of
each
student's
writing--even
if
this
new
approach
involved
teaching
a
student
the
basics
of
forming
a
sentence.
A
WA
who
tells
a
student
exactly
what
to
write
is
not
helpful,
but
a
WA
who
addresses
each
individual's
strengths
and
weaknesses
will
be
successful,
both
helping
the
student
and
probably
the
WA
as
well.
In
the
past
year,
my
work
as
a
WA
has
definitely
helped
to
improve
my
style
of
writing,
as
well
as
helping
to
improve
my
technical
skills.
For
instance,
my
writing
has
improved
on
the
most
basic
level
in
that,
a
student
would
ask
me
a
question
about
punctuation,
and
I
would
look
the
answer
up
in
the
handbook.
Thus
I
would
know
how
to
punctuate
correctly
as
well.
Also,
in
the
past
year,
I
have
examined
many
different
styles
of
writing,
and
after
reading
the
papers
which
I
found
to
be
the
most
clear
and
most
eloquent,
I
was
able
to
improve
my
own
writing.
However,
several
times
in
the
past
year,
I
found
my
work
as
a
WA
to
be
much
more
difficult
than
it
was
rewarding.
In
one
instance
I
learned
that
one
of
my
students
had
absolutely
no
idea
how
to
form
a
complete
sentence,
and
I
can
remember
thinking,
How
do
you
get
to
college
without
knowing
how
to
make
a
sentence?
In
any
case,
I
knew
that
this
student
certainly
could
not
express
his
ideas
clearly
without
learning
the
basics
of
writing
a
sentence.
This
student
had
clearly
done
hours
of
research
to
prepare
for
his
twenty
page
section
of
a
sixty
page
paper.
However,
when
conference
time
came,
only
one
member
of
the
three
member
group
showed
up,
and
the
student
who
needed
the
most
help
was
nowhere
to
be
found.
I
tried
to
reschedule,
but
I
received
no
cooperation,
and
thus
I
simply
wrote
the
page
numbers
in
the
St.
Martin's
Handbook
where
this
student
could
locate
help.
I
did
not
feel
that
it
was
my
responsibility
to
go
through
the
paper
and
fix
every
sentence,
because
this
student
needed
to
be
taught,
not
told
how
to
write.
Nonetheless,
I
felt
like
I
failed
this
uncooperative
student
in
some
way;
however,
I
knew
that
sometime
during
his
high
school
career,
the
teacher
who
let
him
pass
a
basic
writing
course
without
knowing
how
to
make
a
sentence
had
failed
him
even
more.
However,
I
have
also
had
some
very
successful
experiences
in
my
position
as
a
Writing
Associate.
One
experience
in
particular
involved
a
group
of
three
people
assigned
to
write
a
sixty
page
paper
(each
student
writing
his
or
her
own
twenty
page
portion).
These
three
people
each
had
a
well
written
section,
but
their
sections
did
not
flow
together.
Since
I
did
not
find
this
assignment
to
be
very
fair
to
begin
with,
I
felt
very
frustrated
that
these
three
people,
who
would
have
done
very
well
on
their
own
section,
were
forced
to
mash
together
such
vastly
different
information.
However,
during
our
second
conference,
one
of
the
students
suggested
that
we
make
an
outline
of
each
section
and
then
see
which
segments
would
connect
together
the
most
smoothly.
This
strategy
worked
quite
well,
and
the
three
totally
different
sections
finally
began
to
flow.
This
successful
experience
helped
to
change
my
style
of
conferencing,
and
in
my
second
semester
as
a
WA,
I
even
found
myself
challenging
some
of
the
advice
which
I
had
given
previously.
First,
I
began
to
change
the
style
of
my
conferences.
At
first,
I
had
simply
told
each
student
what
exactly
I
had
found
to
be
problematic
within
his
or
her
paper,
and
then
I
would
give
suggestions
as
to
how
he
or
she
could
fix
the
problem.
Now,
conversely,
I
begin
a
conference
by
asking
the
student
what
he
or
she
found
to
be
most
troubling
about
his
or
her
paper.
Then,
I
work
with
the
student
on
how
to
address
those
specific
issues(which
usually
end
up
being
the
issues
which
I
would
have
pointed
out.)
Also,
I
no
longer
tell
students
how
I
would
change
problematic
areas
of
a
paper.
Instead,
for
instance,
I
ask
the
student
for
suggestions
as
to
how
something
could
be
worded
to
sound
clearer
or
to
flow
better,
thus
avoiding
the
possibility
of
forcing
the
students
to
write
exactly
like
I
write.
Additionally,
there
were
some
styles
of
writing
which
I
had
been
taught
never
to
use,
which
now
I
know
are
not
quite
so
taboo.
For
instance,
I
was
taught
never
to
write
in
the
first
person;
however,
as
you
can
see,
I
have
learned
that
the
first
person
is
not
as
horrible
as
I
once
thought.
Also,
I
believe
that
in
high
school,
I
was
never
really
taught
to
think
for
myself,
but
rather
to
repeat
what
the
teacher
or
book
had
said.
Now,
I
encourage
students
with
off
the
wall
ideas
to
express
themselves
if
I
believe
that
they
have
adequate
proof
of
their
statement.
Also,
in
the
past
year,
I
have
learned
that
it
is
certainly
not
easy
to
write
like
a
WA.
There
is
a
lot
of
pressure
involved
in
writing
like
a
WA.
This
pressure
comes
from
the
high
expectations
which
both
my
peers
and
professors
have
for
my
writing.
Also,
as
a
WA,
I
found
myself
expecting
more
from
my
own
writing.
There
were
times
when
I
would
reread
a
paper
many
times
in
order
to
insure
that
it
was
clear
and
concise.
Also,
I
have
read
the
papers
of
so
many
students
who
make
a
statement
about
something,
but
then
the
student
does
not
follow
up
the
statement
with
examples
or
arguments.
Thus,
I
have
begun
to
examine
my
papers
in
order
to
be
sure
that
I
have
clearly
addressed
every
claim
that
I
make.
Thus,
I
have
been
able
to
claim
more
daring
things,
knowing
that
I
have
proof
to
back
up
my
statements.
Additionally,
I
have
also
learned
the
valuable
lesson
that
my
writing
is
not
exactly
expected
to
be
perfect.
One
professor
pointed
out,
much
to
my
dismay,
that
I
had
been
punctuating
a
certain
conjunction
completely
wrong
(for
years).
He
simply
reminded
me
that
I
was
a
WA,
and
then
told
me
with
a
chuckle
that
he
didn't
want
me
to
embarrass
myself.
I
thanked
him
because
I
would
certainly
have
gone
on
thinking
that
my
way
was
correct.
The
most
valuable
piece
of
advice
that
I
could
offer
to
a
new
WA
would
be--well
actually,
there
are
several
things.
First
of
all,
you
must
learn
to
budget
your
time,
remembering
that
your
work
comes
first.
Secondly,
you
cannot
blame
yourself
for
unsuccessful
conferences
if
your
students
are
unwilling
to
accept
help.
Finally,
I
feel
that
a
WA
should
ask
more
questions
and
give
fewer
orders
when
conducting
a
conference.
By
asking
more
questions
the
WA
is
able
to
discover
the
concerns
of
the
student
while
actively
involving
the
student
in
the
production
of
a
clear
and
complete
paper.
Working
as
a
writing
associate
is
a
learning
experience,
not
only
for
the
students,
but
for
the
WA
as
well.
Each
conference
presents
new
dilemmas
which
lead
to
new
insights.
Overall,
a
WA's
purpose
is
to
help
the
student
to
become
a
better
writer,
but
the
WA
cannot
help
those
who
do
not
wish
to
be
helped.
A
WA
must
always
remember
to
choose
words
carefully,
because
everything
that
is
said
to
a
student
could
possibly
have
a
profound
impact
on
the
student's
future
as
a
writer.
