Professor
Falbo
Literary
Narrative
I
was
told
to
reflect
upon
my
summer
on
the
first
day
of
first
grade.
Mrs.
Forbes
wanted
the
class
to
write
about
the
most
memorable
events
during
summer
vacation
and
then
draw
a
picture
to
correspond.
I
remember
her
distributing
the
flimsy
yellow
paper
larger
than
standard
size
that
tore
easily
when
erased.
It
was
special
paper
with
a
blank
box
allowing
a
drawing
above
the
alternating
solid
and
dotted
lines
on
the
bottom
half.
Every
student
in
the
class
of
twenty
had
to
use
the
paper
given
and
write
specifically
about
the
summer.
At
the
time
I
am
sure
I
enjoyed
relaying
stories
of
sticky
days
at
the
pool
while
showing
off
my
perfect
penmanship
as
well
as
my
drawing
ability.
But
now
I
realize
that
throughout
grade
school,
high
school
and
even
college
I
have
always
had
to
follow
a
set
form,
idea,
or
structure.
I
never
understood
why
students
were
not
encouraged
to
do
more
creative
writing
instead
of
following
a
certain
structure
or
imitating
another
writer.
Outside
of
school,
when
I
was
in
second
grade,
I
decided
to
write
a
murder
mystery.
I
was
intrigued
by
horror
films
and
really
did
not
know
any
other
way
to
create
my
own
movie
other
than
through
a
rough
script.
The
story
was
a
narrative,
but
it
also
revealed
the
internal
thoughts
of
each
character.
This
seems
surprising
tome
now
since
I
usually
struggle
with
changing
voices.
I
also
created
detailed
drawings
to
help
portray
images,
setting,
and
the
physical
description
of
characters.
I
was
not
able
to
make
my
writing
colorful,
so
I
expressed
my
ideas
through
picture
images.
Reading
Monday
Masacre
now,
I
am
surprised
how
the
plot
keeps
me
in
suspense.
It
does
mimic
many
of
the
horror
films
of
the
late
seventies,
but
I
set
the
characters
in
a
different
setting
and
developed
them
based
on
people
I
knew.
I
realized
that
I
was
gathering
my
ideas
from
a
form
instead
of
completely
creating
my
own
plot
or
style.
The
summer
after
second
grade
I
organized
a
children's
day
camp
that
consisted
of
my
little
brother,
some
of
his
friends,
and
my
cousins.
I
wrote
day
plans
almost
like
lesson
plans,
and
each
day
had
a
theme.
One
day
was
music
day,
so
the
campers
made
instruments,
wrote
their
own
music,
and
I
did
just
the
same
as
an
example.
Another
day
we
went
on
a
field
trip
to
Nolt's
Pond,
which
is
a
wholesale
animal
store.
In
order
to
prepare
for
the
trip,
I
researched
the
animals
that
the
campers
were
going
to
see
to
give
them
some
background.
After
the
field
trip,
I
helped
them
to
write
summaries
of
what
they
had
seen
on
the
trip.
We
also
had
water
day,
the
four
seasons,
and
party
day,
which
was
the
last
day
of
camp.
I
did
not
do
a
lot
of
paper
writing,
but
I
created
activities
for
each
day
and
followed
a
set
plan
with
time
limits
for
each
activity.
The
campers
always
had
a
lesson
of
the
day,
a
craft,
and
free
time.
My
Mom,
who
is
a
teacher,
helped
and
my
Aunts
were
glad
to
have
the
week
off.
They
were
all
very
supportive
of
my
projects
that
always
became
more
extravagant
than
I
originally
had
planned.
Another
over-the-top
project
I
worked
on
over
the
summer
was
a
skit
that
I
created
in
a
day
and
then
directed
and
performed
with
actors
the
next
day.
I
was
ten
and,
of
course,
had
my
brother,
cousins,
and
a
few
close
friends
play
the
starring
roles
in
the
production
of
Jazz
Power
T.V.
I
first
chose
the
music
I
wanted
to
incorporate
into
the
show.
(I
still
am
very
much
affected
by
music,
and
much
of
my
poetry
and
ideas
are
influenced
by
music.)
Next
came
the
idea,
which
was
not
that
original,
but
came
to
have
a
life
of
its
own.
I
wanted
to
be
able
to
have
my
friends
and
myself
dance
and
to
have
my
brother
and
cousins
add
the
comic
relief.
I
wrote
the
script
accordingly,
and
it
consisted
of
corny
jokes
that
centered
around
the
television
host.
My
family
came
to
watch
us
transform
my
living
room
into
a
stage,
spouting
punch
lines
and
springing
leotards.
I
not
only
created
the
set,
costumes,
and
script,
but
I
also
worked
with
the
actors
and
added
their
input
to
the
show.
It
was
a
great
success,
and
my
family
and
I
still
watch
the
video
and
laugh
at
how
great
the
production
was
for
children
between
the
ages
of
four
and
ten.
Moving
forward
to
sixth
grade,
I
had
less
free
time
to
spend
using
my
imagination,and
I
learned
to
write
my
first
research
paper.
The
students
were
allowed
to
choose
any
topic
they
felt
was
exciting
to
spend
a
semester
researching.
I
chose
dance
as
my
topic,
which
is
quite
a
general
and
broad
subject,
but
I
enjoyed
learning
more
about
my
favorite
hobby
and
building
upon
my
own
knowledge
I
had
gained
from
years
of
dance
classes,
conventions,
and
competitions.
I
learned
the
basic
writing
and
researching
processes,
which
consist
of
brain
storming,
topic,
research,
organize
notecards,
outline,
rough
draft,
and
final
paper.
Miss
Trach
taught
the
class
the
trick
of
taking
notes
on
three
by
five
notecards
while
researching.
She
told
us
to
always
write
the
bibliographic
information
on
the
first
card
of
each
new
source
so
we
knew
the
source
from
which
the
facts
on
the
notecards
were
taken.
I
still
use
notecards
today
because
they
help
keep
quotes
and
borrowed
ideas
separate
and
organized
and
make
it
easier
to
cut
and
paste
since
each
thought
is
detached
from
the
others.
After
spending
a
semester
on
the
research
paper,
I
remember
gaining
a
feeling
of
relief
and
accomplishment.
I
was
so
proud
to
have
followed
the
process
and
learned
so
much
while
enjoying
exploring
my
topic.
I
still
remember
most
of
the
information
I
gathered
for
my
term
paper
on
dance.
Seventh
grade
was
a
difficult
year
because
the
English
teachers
were
required
to
cover
a
lot
of
material
in
the
curriculum.
The
class
was
not
required
to
do
a
lot
of
writing
since
the
concentration
was
on
vobabulary,
spelling,
and
analyzing
classic
novels
and
plays.
Mrs.
Albright
did,
however,
assign
one
writing
assignment
that
could
be
entered
into
the
Scholastic
Writing
Contest
if
desired.
The
genre
was
each
student's
choice,
and
we
had
to
spend
most
of
the
time
outside
of
class
working
on
our
piece.
I
wrote
a
script
and
won
an
award
in
the
category,
which
was
quite
a
shock
to
me
since
I
always
felt
inferior
to
many
of
my
classmates.
Recalling
this
now,
I
realize
that
creative
writing
with
no
criteria
to
follow
allows
me
to
flourish
as
a
writer.
It
comes
much
more
naturally
to
me,
and
the
pressure
is
off
as
to
whether
or
not
I
am
following
the
teacher's
criteria
or
form.
Another
free
writing
experience
was
in
eighth
grade
when
the
class
was
required
to
construct
a
portfolio
throughout
the
year.
Even
though
the
portfolio
was
assigned,
it
allowed
me
to
try
all
types
and
styles
of
writing.
I
remember
having
many
choices
and
writing
reader
responses,
short
stories,
poems,
monologues
and
scripts,
and
a
lesson
plan.
Peer
evaluations
were
also
a
part
of
our
writing
process
and
were
incorporated
into
the
final
product.
At
first,
I
did
not
enjoy
receiving
criticism,
but
at
the
end
of
the
year
I
was
proud
to
pass
my
forty
page
portfolio
onto
ninth
grade.
Along
with
the
eight
grade
portfolio
came
the
science
fair
project
and
paper.
I
had
dreaded
this
project
because
all
the
older
students
complained
about
the
work
load
and
the
difficulty.
I
had
never
written
a
scientific
paper
and
had
no
idea
what
format
to
use.
The
scientific
method
seemed
quite
different
from
the
other
research
papers
and
response
essays
I
had
written
in
the
past.
I
remember
reading
my
teacher's
comments
to
my
rough
draft
that
covered
every
page
and
wanting
to
cry
because
he
wanted
me
to
cut
out
so
much
information
that
he
considered
flowery
and
irrelevant.
I
did
learn,
after
hours
spent
deleting,
to
simplify
my
writing
and
only
state
the
important
facts
without
worrying
about
transitions
and
descriptive
or
flowery
words.
His
teachings
and
corrections
seemed
to
contradict
everything
I
was
learning
at
the
time
in
my
English
class,
but
thanks
to
Mr.
Weinberg
I
had
no
problems
in
high
school
with
science
fair
and
lab
summaries.
It
also
gave
me
a
lot
to
build
on
for
the
future,
which
in
turnprepared
me
for
Lafayette's
VAST
several
years
later.
Junior
year
in
high
school
was
an
enormous
growing
period
when
it
came
to
my
style
of
writing.
I
finally
seemed
to
have
a
style
instead
of
mimicing
teachers
and
other
writers.
I
wrote
a
critical
analysis
term
paper
that
required
a
lot
of
research
and
focus.
I
felt
for
the
first
time
that
I
had
written
a
well
organized,
risky,
and
unique
paper.
It
had
seemed
as
if
everything
shoved
into
my
brain
for
the
past
eleven
years
came
together.
The
topic
dealt
with
different
personaes
in
Sylvia
Plath's
poems
which
coincide
with
those
in
The
Bell
Jar.
I
remember
reading
two
books
of
her
poetry
and
her
novel
and
searching
for
hours
in
the
library
for
critics'
articles
that
supported
my
thesis.
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
writing
this
paper
because
I
felt
my
thesis
was
well
supported,
and
I
followed
the
structure
of
introduction,
thesis
statement,
three
main
points
within
the
body,
restatement
of
the
thesis,
and
conclusion
---
in
that
order.
I
also
came
to
many
conclusions
myself
and
built
upon
critics'
responses
to
Plath.
I
wrote
a
lot
of
poetry
outside
of
school
assignments
in
eleventh
and
twelfth
grade,
and
this
may
have
been
due
to
Plath's
influence.
I
think
that
it
was
my
release
of
a
lot
of
mixed
emotions
that
go
along
with
growing
older.
I
seemed
to
have
used
writing
as
an
outlet
when
I
needed
to
get
my
act
together,
but
I
also
believe
some
of
my
better
writing
comes
from
raw
emotion.
And
the
transition
into
college
was
not
too
difficult
since
I
had
a
well
rounded
background
and
accepted
the
idea
of
revealing
myself
or
taking
a
risk
through
writing.
My
most
memorable
and
significant
class
is
creative
writing
because
I
missed
freewriting
and
was
surprised
to
see
that
I
could
use
my
imagination
much
like
when
I
was
in
first,
second,
and
third
grade.
Not
only
was
I
able
to
be
creative,
but
I
also
learned
how
to
enhance
my
writing.
I
felt
as
if
I
was
able
to
write
whatever
I
wanted,
but
looking
back
I
really
learned
a
lot
about
my
style
and
how
to
become
a
better
writer.
My
imagery
became
much
richer,
my
voices
clearer,
and
my
characters
more
developed.
Most
importantly,
I
was
and
still
am
able
to
share
my
works
and
learn
to
take
advantage
of
others'
constructive
criticism.
I
feel
as
if
I
can
always
learn
more
and
will
never
stop
striving
to
become
a
better
writer.
I
was
most
definitely
prepared
for
college
writing.
The
twelve
years
prior
to
college,
much
of
which
I
thought
were
boring
and
pointless
assignments
that
seemed
to
stifle
my
creativity,
actually
laid
an
excellent
foundation.
The
college
experience
with
writing,
especially
in
my
first
year
seminar,
college
writing,
and
creative
writing
built
from
my
high
school
experience
also
allowed
me
to
be
able
to
now
as
a
senior
at
Lafayette
explore
my
creativity
that
I
forgot
that
I
had
back
in
grade
school
where
it
all
began.
I
believe
without
that
structural
and
creative
foundation,
I
never
would
have
had
the
confidence
to
become
a
part
of
the
College
Writing
Program
and
would
not
be
writing
my
Literary
Narrative.
