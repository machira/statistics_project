Almost
every
college
student
can
trace
the
progression
of
his
or
her
writing
back
to
certain
teachers,
events,
or
other
influences
which
may
have
combined
to
create
an
informed
academic
writer.
In
my
experiences
as
a
writer,
there
have
been
several
interesting
and
helpful
teachers
who
have
helped
me
to
combine
a
genuine
desire
to
be
a
good
writer
with
the
appropriate
skills
to
succeed.
As
a
young
child,
I
had
always
prided
myself
on
being
a
good
math
student.
However,
as
I
progressed
through
elementary
school,
I
realized
that
math
problems
were
not
fun
to
practice
at
home
on
a
rainy
summer
day.
Thus,
in
order
to
entertain
myself,
I
would
write
short
stories
and
then
draw
pictures
to
accompany
my
stories.
Usually,
my
stories
were
about
unicorns,
princesses,
or
one
of
the
many
other
fairy
tale
dreams
which
occupy
a
little
girl's
mind.
Nonetheless,
I
would
occupy
myself
for
hours
writing
these
stories,
and
then
I
would
read
them
to
my
parents
while
holding
the
illustrations
which
I
had
produced
to
go
along
with
each
new
scene.
Probably
due
to
the
fact
that
writing
these
stories
occupied
my
time,
my
parents
encouraged
me
to
write
more.
Thus,
I
began
to
enjoy
creative
writing.
However,
despite
the
fact
that
I
enjoyed
writing
at
a
young
age,
I
believe
the
appeal
of
spending
hours
sitting
at
a
desk
wore
off
after
a
few
months.
Thus,
I
believe
the
next
time
I
wrote
a
creative
story
was
in
the
sixth
grade.
I
remember
this
assignment
because
I
had
particular
difficulty
trying
to
think
of
something
to
write
about.
Our
teacher
simply
asked
the
class
to
write
a
two
page
fictional
story
about
some
sort
of
adventure.
We
were
asked
to
create
at
least
three
characters,
and
were
allowed
to
incorporate
dialogue.
I
thought
for
hours
about
what
I
was
going
to
write,
and
finally
came
up
with
some
sort
of
camping
adventure
story.
After
coming
up
with
a
topic,
the
remainder
of
the
story
seemed
incredibly
easy
to
write,
and
it
was
actually
fun
to
write
a
story
with
no
guidelines
or
rules.
Then,
in
eighth
grade,
students
were
faced
with
the
dreaded
five-hundred
word
essay.
I
was
scared
to
death
of
these
essays
because
five-hundred
words
sounded
so
long,
and
these
were
the
first
papers
which
I
was
ever
required
to
type.
The
teacher
of
my
eighth
grade
class
usually
gave
us
a
topic
or
a
statement
with
which
we
could
choose
to
agree
or
disagree.
I
remember
having
difficulty
deciding
which
side
to
choose,
despite
the
fact
that
the
papers
were
based
upon
opinion
and
not
research.
I
also
remember
having
a
terrible
time
trying
to
type
these
papers,
since
I
had
never
been
required
to
do
so
before.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I
still
hate
typing
papers,
and
would
much
rather
simply
write
with
a
pencil.
Then,
in
tenth
grade,
I
was
challenged
by
an
English
teacher
for
the
first
time
in
my
writing
career.
This
teacher,
Mrs.
Harter,
was
a
scary
old
woman,
and
horror
stories
circulated
about
her
on
a
daily
basis.
The
first
day
of
her
class,
she
explained
that
we
would
be
required
to
write
several
papers,
including
a
substantial
research
paper
and
a
book
of
poetry.
In
addition
to
these
papers
and
the
poetry,
we
were
required
to
keep
a
journal
and
write
five
minutes
a
day
about
a
random
word
which
she
would
place
on
the
chalkboard
in
the
beginning
of
class.
I
remember
thinking
at
the
time
that
this
journal
was
pointless,
when
actually
it
served
as
an
excellent
way
to
get
the
class
thinking
and
exercise
our
usually
lazy
brains.
When
the
time
came
to
write
the
research
paper,
the
entire
class
was
a
little
nervous,
Mrs.
Harter
required
us
to
choose
the
topic,
to
know
it
thoroughly,
to
cite
several
sources,
and
to
form
a
clear
thesis.
This
was
the
first
time
I
had
ever
been
required
to
have
a
thesis,
and
Mrs.
Harter
was
very
picky
as
to
what
she
would
accept.
Thus,
despite
the
fact
that
I
was
scared
to
death
of
this
woman,
I
had
to
ask
her
for
help
in
forming
my
introduction
and
thesis.
She
taught
me
that
my
thesis
should
be
placed
at
the
end
of
my
attention
grabbing
introductory
paragraph,
and
then
she
proceeded
to
cover
my
entire
paper
with
corrections
in
red
ink.
However,
despite
my
disappointment
in
my
own
writing,
I
realized
that
she
had
just
made
my
job
much
easier
by
helping
me
to
pinpoint
exactly
what
I
needed
to
research.
Thus,
it
was
through
this
experience
that
I
learned
the
meaning
of
Mrs.
Harter's
favorite
saying;
Knowing
the
process
gives
you
the
freedom
to
be
creative.
It
was
also
at
this
time
that
I
realized
that
I
did
not
like
to
write
research
papers,
but
would
much
rather
write
my
own
ideas,
rather
then
regurgitate
facts.
Then,
in
my
final
year
of
high
school
English,
I
was
challenged
by
both
my
teacher
and
the
content
of
the
course.
The
course
required
a
very
intense
workload
in
order
to
prepare
students
for
the
advanced
placement
test
in
Hay
of
the
academic
year.
Each
night
our
teacher,
Mr.
Nailor,
would
assign
a
few
chapters
in
a
novel
or
some
poetry
to
be
read,
and
we
would
write
an
informal
journal
about
the
reading.
These
journals
could
be
about
things
which
we
did
or
did
not
understand,
opinions
about
the
quality
of
the
writing
or
the
characters,
or
general
themes
which
we
may
have
recognized.
Then,
the
next
day,
we
would
bring
our
journals
to
class
and
discuss
them
or
ask
questions.
These
journals
were
an
excellent
way
for
us
to
begin
thinking
about
a
particular
work,
and
to
express
our
opinions
or
uncertainties
about
what
we
had
read.
Also,
the
journals
provided
excellent
class
discussion
material
which
would
cause
each
member
of
the
class
to
reevaluate
their
original
opinion
in
order
to
understand
those
of
the
other
members
of
the
class.
Then,
when
it
was
time
to
write
a
longer,
more
structured
paper,
we
were
allowed
to
elaborate
on
any
journal
entry,
including
ideas
from
class
discussion
if
we
desired.
These
journals
not
only
provided
our
brain
with
a
daily
challenge
in
thinking,
but
also
helped
us
to
gain
the
practice
writing
which
we
would
all
need
to
succeed
on
the
Advanced
Placement
tests.
Finally,
I
was
ready
to
make
the
usually
rough
transition
from
high
school
English
to
college
English
courses.
However,
thanks
to
my
senior
year
English
teacher,
this
transition
was
not
as
difficult
as
I
had
anticipated.
Since
I
was
a
Biology
major,
my
first
year
seminar
was
my
only
English
related
course,
and
after
about
a
month
of
classes,
it
was
also
the
only
class
that
I
actually
liked.
Our
professor
gave
the
class
a
lot
of
freedom
when
writing
papers,
but
at
the
sajne
time
tried
to
steer
us
in
the
right
direction
without
actually
telling
us
what
to
think*
The
papers
which
were
assigned
were
not
research
papers,
but
were
more
oriented
towards
the
novels
we
had
read
and
our
own
interpretations
or
ideas
about
these
novels.
With
a
few
exceptions,
the
writing
techniques
which
I
learned
in
my
first
year
seminar
were
very
similar
to
those
which
I
had
learned
in
my
high
school
advanced
placement
course.
My
first
year
seminar
professor
taught
me
that
I
needed
to
support
my
claims
with
more
evidence,
and
that
it
was
acceptable
to
use
I
on
occasion.
Also,
my
experience
in
my
first
year
seminar
as
a
whole
showed
me
that
I
enjoyed
writing
much
more
than
Biology,
and
I
therefore
became
an
English
major
and
in
turn
a
much
happier
person.
Then,
sophomore
year
I
faced
my
biggest
challenge
as
a
writer
in
an
introductory
psychology
course.
Each
member
of
the
class
was
asked
to
pick
a
topic
and
do
a
fairly
long
research\arguement
paper
on
the
topic.
First,
I
had
trouble
picking
a
topic.
Then,
when
I
finally
did
pick
a
topic,
I
had
trouble
researching
the
topic.
I
also
had
a
very
strong
opinion
about
the
topic,
and
thus
had
trouble
explaining
the
opposing
arguments.
I
knew
as
I
was
writing
this
paper
that
it
would
be
one
of
the
worst,
if
not
the
worst
paper
I
had
ever
written.
However,
I
had
no
idea
how
to
improve
the
paper,
because
I
was
not
accustomed
to
doing
this
type
of
scientific
writing.
I
remember
jumping
around
from
one
topic
or
idea
to
the
next
in
no
particular
order,
and
explaining
insignificant
areas
in
detail
while
forgetting
more
important
things.
Needless
to
say,
the
grade
which
I
received
was
not
at
all
what
I
wanted
or
usually
obtained.
Therefore,
the
next
time
I
was
assigned
a
research
paper,
I
made
sure
to
ask
for
help
as
much
as
possible,
and
tried
not
to
add
any
of
my
own
irrelevant
opinions.
Throughout
a
college
student's
many
years
of
schooling,
there
are
countless
teachers,
professors,
and
experiences
which
combine
to
create
a
unique
academic
writer.
In
my
experience,
the
combination
of
interesting
material,
creative
freedom,
and
insightful
teachers
molded
me
into
the
writer
I
am
now.
