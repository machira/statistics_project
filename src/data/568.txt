Steps
in
the
Process:
A
Personal
Narrative
NThe
inside
of
the
shell
looks
to
me
with
enormous
and
uncomplicated
eyes,O
is
the
sentence
I
copied
on
paper
my
freshman
year
of
college
at
Saint
MaryOs
College
of
California
on
my
first
day
of
an
expository
writing
class.
Assorted
objects
were
placed
in
the
center
of
a
table,
which
twenty
students
and
I
sat
around.
My
professor
asked
us
to
describe
one
of
the
objects
as
an
introductory
exercise
to
our
creative
writing
unit.
I
focused
on
a
seashell
amongst
a
piece
of
dark
driftwood
and
a
black
and
white
framed
photo
of
a
white-haired
old
man
with
his
silver
pocket
watch.
My
initial
inclination
was
to
sketch
a
still
life
of
the
convoluted
shape
in
opposition
to
writing;
however,
I
looked
around
me
and
my
classmates
were
quickly
scribbling
down
sentences,
which
I
assumed
were
detailed
descriptions
of
the
objects.
At
the
end
of
our
allotted
five
minutes,
I
wrote
my
single
sentence.
The
professor
requested
for
us
to
read
aloud
what
we
had
written,
and
as
I
listened
to
each
studentOs
long
prose,
I
was
surprised
and
amazed
at
how
quickly
everyone
took
the
assignment
so
literally.
Even
though
the
varying
descriptions
of
summer
days
on
the
beach,
the
silence
of
a
meandering
river,
and
unforgettable
relationships
with
family
memories
evoked
emotions
deep
within
myself,
the
responses
from
my
classmates
were
typical
to
such
an
assignment,
thus
lacking
in
true
creativity.
They
drew
the
objects
and
memories
using
simple
words,
but
needed
long
and
wordy
phrases
to
convey
their
desired
emotion.
When
my
turn
came,
I
read
nervously,
NThe
inside
of
the
shell
looks
to
me
with
enormous
and
uncomplicated
eyes.O
The
class
looked
at
each
other
with
a
questionable
and
a
curious
facial
expression
as
I
blushed.
?
NBrilliantO,
declared
Professor
Ringgold.
Aside
from
my
newfound
confidence
in
my
creative
writing
ability,
this
first
college
writing
exercise
was
the
beginning
of
my
understanding
of
myself
as
a
writer
beyond
mechanical
and
grammar
technique
exercises
within
the
classroom
in
middle
and
high
school.
In
retrospect,
I
think
my
professor
was
demonstrating
the
power
of
our
personal
experiences
and
how
those
experiences
affect
not
only
life
but
our
perspective
and
technique
in
writing.
Although
I
have
chosen
psychology
as
an
academic
path,
reading
and
writing
have
always
played
a
vital
part
in
my
life;
however,
even
though
schooling
helped
significantly
with
grammar
and
technique,
classroom
assignments
and
exercises
were
not
my
major
inspirations
in
developing
my
writing
skills
into
creative
expressions.
Writing
is
the
most
essential
form
of
communication,
and
the
ability
to
communicate
abstract
thoughts
in
a
spoken
or
written
form
is
one
of
the
many
reasons
why
writing
has
become
so
fascinating
as
an
art
form,
which
was
a
concept
that
took
my
many
years
to
accept.
Many
different
academic
and
personal
experiences
shaped
and
influenced
my
learning,
and
how
reading
and
writing
have
become
such
important
outlets
in
my
life.
I
was
always
a
generally
creative
child
growing
up,
but
my
writing
skills
only
developed
once
I
drew
the
connection
between
my
approach
with
writing
and
art
assignments.
Ever
since
I
was
very
young
even
before
school,
I
loved
to
draw
and
paint.
My
grandmother
and
father
both
showed
incredible
talent,
and
supported
my
through
my
artistic
struggles
and
achievements.
Through
elementary
school,
I
worked
hard
copying
pictures
from
magazines
and
pictures
to
develop
the
most
basic
skills.
Similarly,
I
learned
the
basics
of
reading
and
vocabulary,
but
took
no
pleasure
in
the
tediousness
of
spelling
and
sentence
construction.
I
had
yet
to
acknowledge
the
similarity
to
art;
the
long
exercises
are
necessary
to
excelling
beyond
the
given
assignments
and
create
an
analytic
perspective
in
the
upcoming
school
years.
Again
in
middle
school,
I
learned
to
construct
my
own
artistic
composition
as
well
as
to
prepare
writing
a
paper.
My
7th
grade
teacher,
Mr.
Nicolini,
demonstrated
how
to
approach
a
multi-paragraph
paper
with
detailed
steps.
My
first
step
should
always
be
brainstorming.
The
first
couple
of
weeks
of
class
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
experiment
with
poetry
and
to
participate
in
various
writing
activities,
but
one
assignment
in
particular
asked
students
to
choose
a
topic
of
interest
and
copy
down
all
the
information
they
knew
about
this
subject
of
interest.
Sitting
off
to
one
side
of
the
classroom,
I
attempted
the
assignment
by
writing
the
word
NathleticsO
on
top
of
my
paper.
Under
the
word,
I
described
why
I
chose
the
topic,
what
sports
meant
to
me
as
an
athlete,
and
how
exercise
has
played
a
crucial
role
in
my
life.
Before
the
15
minutes
had
passed,
I
covered
one
and
a
half
pages
with
information.
I
scribbled
down
on
paper
everything
that
even
remotely
interested
my
for
a
paper:
which
sports
I
have
currently
played,
why
teamwork
is
so
important
as
a
skill,
why
rules
should
be
followed
during
each
game,
how
leaders
are
assigned
to
teams,
and
how
do
athletes
become
so
strong
physically
and
mentally.
For
the
next
few
days,
I
jotted
down
ideas
every
once
in
a
while
as
they
came
to
me.
Then
I
transcribed
those
ideas
into
an
outline.
My
teacher
assisted
with
the
format
throughout
the
outline
process,
complete
with
simple
quotes
and
explanations,
page
numbers
and
citations.
Finally,
I
sat
down
at
my
desk
and
wrote
a
series
of
topic
sentences,
supportive
content,
and
conclusions
until
the
first
draft
of
my
paper
was
complete.
With
an
extensive
outline,
I
learned
how
easy
to
write
a
first
draft,
which
was
ultimately
the
shortest
part
of
the
whole
process.
After
the
paper
was
complete,
I
highlighted
all
filler
verbs
such
as
NisO,
NbeO,
NuseO,
and
NgetO
to
make
sure
my
verbs
are
active
with
little
repetition.
Then,
I
had
several
people
read
and
comment
on
my
paper
-
my
mother,
my
friends
-
anyone
who
has
a
few
spare
minutes.
I
take
their
comments
into
consideration
and
make
my
final
revisions
to
the
finished
product.
Even
though
this
process
was
quite
extensive,
I
was
proud
of
the
final
product.
As
I
perfected
the
writing
process
my
grades
increased,
but
unfortunately
writing
lacked
enjoyment
because
Mr.
Nicolini
took
structure
and
organization
to
such
an
extreme
that
I
dreaded
the
words
writing
assignment.
This
feeling
has
stuck
with
me
until
high
school.
Only
until
high
school
at
Campolindo
High
did
I
realize
that
the
brainstorming
and
planning
process
from
middle
school
mimic
the
same
process
in
creating
artwork.
Throughout
high
school,
many
creative
and
artistic
instances
most
profoundly
shaped
the
writer
that
I
am
today.
My
freshman
English
teacher,
Mr.
McNevin,
continued
to
teach
me
the
importance
of
content
and
style,
but
that
writing
can
be
technical
yet
fun
as
well
and
that
writing
is
about
making
choices
of
words,
style,
format,
audience
and
purpose.
At
the
beginning
of
the
semester,
I
struggled
with
my
writing
in
terms
of
content,
but
still
maintained
adequate
structure
from
the
writing
process
learned
in
middle
school.

I
excelled
in
my
fine
art
courses,
and
after
meeting
with
my
teacher
about
my
writing,
he
helped
me
draw
on
my
creative
outlet
to
help
me
make
the
most
important
connection
between
the
aesthetic
and
the
written
worlds:
the
only
real
limits
are
oneOs
imagination
and
willingness
to
take
a
chance.
The
process
of
creating
a
work
of
art
and
a
piece
of
writing
follows
the
same
brainstorming
and
technical
process.
After
understanding
this
connection,
I
took
a
greater
deal
of
pleasure
in
the
once
dreaded
writing
assignments.
I
was
implementing
my
own
creative
technique
in
drawing
and
painting,
while
using
word
choice
and
sentence
structure
to
shape
my
own
essays
and
writing
assignments.
From
my
freshman
year,
I
enrolled
in
honors
English
and
writing
courses
as
well
as
art
and
art
history.
However,
my
most
influential
writing
achievements
occurred
in
the
later
years
of
high
school,
which
had
a
profound
impact
on
my
writing
perspective
and
the
perspectives
of
other
students.
During
my
junior
and
senior
years
of
high
school,
I
co-founded
the
Peer
Tutoring
Program
with
an
academic
counselor
and
began
to
tutor
younger
students
in
writing
during
my
last
class
period
and
after
school.
As
a
tutor,
I
found
that
it
was
important
when
starting
with
a
new
student
to
find
out
his
or
her
discomfort
with
writing.
Often
at
this
academic
level,
we
discussed
the
last
several
years
in
his
or
her
education
to
explain
important
basic
concepts.
For
some
students,
critical
grammar
rules
were
the
point
at
which
writing
stopped
flow
and
comprehension.
Some
students
found
that
identifying
their
weaknesses
was
an
embarrassing
process,
in
which
I
needed
to
rely
on
my
newfound
interest
in
psychology
to
help
guide
the
tutee
through
their
insecurities.
I
explained
to
them
that
everyone
comes
to
understand
new
concepts
in
writing
in
a
slightly
different
way,
and
the
problem
was
that
no
teacher
had
taken
the
time
to
explain
their
problem
area
in
a
way
that
would
make
sense
to
them.
In
my
case,
I
drew
upon
an
artistic
connection.
Since
writing
worked
was
a
system
with
many
components,
if
one
building
block
is
missing,
then
it
was
not
surprising
that
the
rest
of
writing
lacked
a
certain
analytic
quality.
Our
mission
together
was
to
find
the
way
in
which
the
system
worked
best
for
them.
My
goal
was
to
not
just
white
wash
over
a
studentOs
weaknesses
with
a
few
rules
that
would
be
quickly
forgotten,
but
to
help
them
develop
an
understanding
and
an
appreciation
for
the
underlying
principles.
Only
once
I
tutored
writing
in
high
school
did
I
realize
the
importance
of
grammar
that
I
resented
so
adamantly
as
a
younger
student.
In
addition,
my
knowledge
or
the
grammar
and
vocabulary
basics
were
refreshed
constantly
through
assisting
with
the
struggles
of
fellow
students.
As
I
graduated
from
high
school,
I
could
not
have
asked
for
a
more
successful
and
creative
outlets
that
my
school
and
personal
experiences
provided,
and
my
writing
thrived
in
such
an
environment
accordingly.
After
all
these
years
of
learning,
my
hard
work
and
creative
background
culminated
to
successful
college
writing,
NThe
inside
of
the
shell
looks
to
me
with
enormous
and
uncomplicated
eyes.O
Even
in
the
few
college
English
classes,
my
writing
skills
have
continued
to
grow,
and
I
have
applied
those
skills
toward
my
science
courses.
Papers
are
no
longer
simple
summaries
and
analyses
or
assigned
books
and
poems,
but
professors
demand
pieces
of
original
work
with
the
freedom
to
draw
out
inspiration
from
other
works
that
evoke
more
emotion
and
creativity
than
I
could
imagine.
In
high
school,
teachers
expected
students
to
keep
to
exactly
what
they
wanted,
compared
to
exploring
the
information
created
from
your
own
opinion
on
the
topic.
With
the
increased
freedom
in
college,
additional
challenges
are
added
as
well.
There
are
additional
stresses
to
create
and
execute
an
original
idea
that
makes
sense,
which
is
interesting
and
relative
to
the
reader
and
argues
a
perspective.
When
given
our
own
path
to
choose
our
writing
topics,
there
is
a
welcomed
challenge
to
the
writing
that
also
gives
the
writing
process
a
sacred
value.
College
has
provided
an
adequate
balance
between
freedom
and
challenge
that
I
need
to
excel
in
my
writing,
and
my
academic
tools
and
creative
artistic
connections
have
given
me
the
ability
to
rise
beyond
these
challenges.
