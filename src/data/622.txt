The
Development
of
My
Writing
E
I
have
seen
pictures
that
I
have
drawn
with
crayons
and
writing
in
crooked
handwriting,
also
in
crayon,
that
I
sent
to
my
grandparents
probably
when
I
had
just
learned
the
alphabet.
These
artworks
usually
consisted
of
people
in
my
family
with
everyoneOs
name
written
above
their
heads
or
of
bright
colored
flowers
with
the
words
NI
miss
youO
up
in
the
clouds.
I
can
tell
that
my
grandparents
treasured
receiving
these
drawings
in
the
mail
and
looking
at
the
drawings
makes
me
laugh
now.
I
do
not
necessarily
remember
the
creation
of
these
projects
but
almost
feel
as
if
I
do
because
I
have
looked
at
them
at
my
grandparentOs
house.
Although
I
do
not
remember
completing
this
assignment
in
second
grade,
I
am
continuously
reminded
of
this
illustration
of
my
classroom
along
with
the
words
NI
love
school
and
I
want
to
be
in
school
forever.O
This
project
is
hanging
in
my
town
hall
and
everyone
that
sees
it
reminds
me
about
it.
The
words
are
written
below
in
newly
learned
cursive
writing
in
between
two
wide
lines
with
a
dotted
one
in
between.
These
words
still
hold
true
today
and
I
find
this
amusing
because
this
most
likely
was
one
of
my
first
written
expressions.
I
did
not
start
writing
papers
until
a
little
later
in
elementary
school,
which
makes
sense
because
my
preschool,
kindergarten,
and
first
grade
schooling
focused
on
learning
the
alphabet
and
how
to
read.
The
first
writing
assignments
I
do
remember
were
research
papers
that
had
illustrative
components
in
second
grade.
One
paper
had
to
be
on
a
dinosaur
and
the
other
on
an
animal
because
I
remember
doing
the
artwork.
I
am
pretty
sure
I
chose
Stegosaurus
and
the
rabbit.
In
fourth
grade
I
learned
American
and
my
state
of
New
HampshireOs
history.
My
essays
were
always
given
special
recognition
and
the
principal
would
come
into
my
class
to
read
them.
I
was
the
only
one
he
would
ever
do
this
with
and
at
the
time
I
felt
slightly
embarrassed
to
be
signaled
out
for
my
writing
and
having
everyone
hear
what
I
had
to
say
in
my
essays.
I
had
an
outstanding
fourth
grade
teacher
who
really
got
me
enthusiastic
about
reading
and
learning.
I
would
even
read
my
text
book
way
ahead
of
what
I
was
being
taught
because
I
just
loved
it.
I
found
these
essays
about
American
history
to
be
fun
and
easy
to
write
because
it
was
a
subject
I
was
interested
in.
EEEE
However,
I
did
not
always
enjoy
writing
or
sharing
my
writing
until
the
later
years
of
high
school.
In
fifth
grade
I
had
my
first
creative
writing
stories
and
poetry
assignments
which
I
found
really
difficult
to
do.
I
did
not
enjoy
this
type
of
writing
and
to
make
matters
worse
I
was
required
to
stand
at
a
podium
and
speak
through
a
microphone
as
I
read
my
writing.
I
did
not
feel
comfortable
having
other
people
hear
my
stories
because
I
did
not
want
to
be
made
fun
of
for
my
ideas.
With
many
of
these
creative
assignments
the
teacher
would
gather
everyoneOs
writing
and
bind
it
together
and
every
student
would
have
a
copy
of
everyone
elseOs
writing.
I
did
not
enjoy
this
either
as
I
was
not
really
up
for
sharing
my
writing
because
I
did
not
think
it
was
well
written.
I
have
always
been
somewhat
of
a
perfectionist
and
was
not
confident
with
my
writing
at
this
time.
I
really
loved
to
read
and
would
check
out
a
tall
stack
of
books
each
week
at
the
library.
For
the
longest
time
math
and
science
were
my
favorite
subjects
in
school
most
likely
because
they
did
not
require
a
lot
of
writing.
These
experiences
shaped
me
into
not
really
enjoying
writing
for
a
few
years.
Although,
these
early
writing
experiences
that
I
had
in
elementary
school
were
not
always
positive
this
has
contributed
to
the
writer
I
am
today
because
they
exposed
me
to
different
types
of
writing
and
prepared
me
for
public
speaking.
In
eighth
grade
I
had
to
write
a
persuasive
speech,
memorize
it,
and
present
it
to
my
class.
EMost
thirteen-year-olds
I
am
sure
shared
my
terror
as
the
class
of
thirty
students
starred
back
at
them
up
at
the
podium.
I
presented
my
speech
with
only
a
few
glitches
but
I
think
it
helped
me
to
learn
how
to
present
my
opinions.
The
assignments
that
had
me
express
myself
and
share
my
ideas
eventually
gave
me
confidence.
It
took
me
towards
the
end
of
high
school
to
be
comfortable
with
freely
stating
my
opinions
but
now
I
have
found
that
I
have
no
trouble
doing
so.
EEEEEE
Over
the
years
I
have
been
exposed
to
many
genres
of
writing
and
as
far
as
Nschool
writingO
goes
probably
defending
and
researching
an
argument
has
probably
been
the
most
common
assignment.
I
have
had
exposure
with
science
writing,
poetry,
creative
writing,
and
keeping
a
journal.
Research
assignments
have
always
been
my
favorite
because
I
love
learning
about
the
subject
I
get
to
write
about.
Usually
I
have
found
that
the
hardest
part
of
the
assignment
is
choosing
the
topic.
I
took
AP
U.S.
History
in
high
school
and
wrote
a
decent
sized
paper
on
why
the
United
States
needed
a
more
interconnected
communication
system
between
the
CIA
and
military
because
the
attack
on
Pearl
Harbor
could
have
been
detected.
I
enjoy
the
challenge
of
research
papers
because
I
have
to
integrate
my
ideas
with
the
research
I
have
found
and
organize
all
the
paragraphs
in
a
logical
manner.
I
remember
my
teacher
was
extremely
impressed
with
my
paper
and
told
me
so
in
his
comments.
One
of
the
coolest
assignments
I
have
ever
had
was
called
the
NThoreau
Project.O
Every
year
the
students
in
the
junior
class
at
my
high
school
would
become
None
with
natureO
and
remove
any
luxuries
such
as
the
computer,
phone,
television,
running
water,
and
electronic
devices
and
appliances
from
their
lives.
Food
was
limited
to
having
just
natural
food
and
nothing
processed
like
bread,
unless
you
made
it
yourself.
Clothes
were
limited
to
two
shirts
and
one
pair
of
pants.
The
assignment
took
place
after
having
read
and
discussed
works
by
Thoreau
and
Emerson.
The
whole
week
I
had
to
keep
a
journal
entry
and
write
about
my
experience.
I
never
really
had
kept
a
journal
growing
up
and
did
not
know
quite
where
to
begin.
I
remember
riding
my
bike
through
the
woods
to
a
park
where
it
was
quiet
and
near
a
river
to
begin
writing.
Throughout
the
week
I
learned
how
to
express
myself
freely
by
just
writing
down
my
thoughts
as
they
came
and
my
teacher
commented
on
my
writing
as
being
Ndelightful
to
read,
positive,
re-affirming,
and
how
I
was
able
to
look
at
the
bigger
picture.O
I
was
surprised
to
find
myself
enjoying
this
project
and
writing
so
much
because
I
typically
stayed
away
from
more
creative
types
of
writing.
I
did
not
start
out
receiving
comments
such
as
Ndelightful
to
readO
on
my
papers
for
a
while
because
I
found
writing
very
difficult.
Through
freshman
year
of
high
school
I
always
thought
of
myself
as
an
okay
writer
because
of
the
AOs
and
BOs
I
would
receive.
I
transferred
to
a
prep
school
my
sophomore
year
and
was
shocked
to
see
my
papers
just
ripped
apart.
I
had
the
same
English
teacher
sophomore
and
junior
years
and
I
have
to
credit
him
for
the
way
he
helped
to
develop
my
writing.
He
is
probably
one
of
the
most
challenging
teachers
I
have
ever
had.
I
worked
with
him
one-on-one
to
revise
my
work
and
he
knew
how
determined
I
was
to
succeed.
In
his
class
we
had
peer
conferences
which
were
often
like
WA
conferences.
I
always
found
it
helpful
when
I
read
otherOs
writing
and
it
helped
me
with
my
writing
and
understanding
of
the
assignment.
However,
after
having
transferred
to
a
school
and
having
my
papers
torn
apart,
I
did
not
really
want
to
share
my
writing
with
my
classmates.
I
remember
sitting
next
to
people
in
class
that
we
would
swap
papers
so
casually
with
and
wondering
what
the
other
student
was
thinking
of
my
writing.
It
took
me
a
while
to
get
used
to
feeling
comfortable
with
sharing
my
writing.
This
teacher
prepared
me
well
for
college
writing
and
these
peer
edits
made
me
feel
better
about
sharing
my
writing
from
the
positive
feedback
I
would
receive.
After
graduating
high
school
I
felt
more
confident
about
my
writing
and
have
been
more
willing
to
share
my
writing
with
readers.
Being
adequately
prepared
in
writing
to
me
included
having
to
analyze
critically,
make
conclusions,
and
take
a
stand
on
a
thesis.
In
my
first
writing
class
at
Lafayette,
my
first
year
seminar
to
be
exact,
I
realized
how
well
prepared
I
had
been
for
college
writing.
I
remembered
my
college
counselor
in
high
school
telling
a
few
friends
and
me
one
day
that
we
would
find
that
we
would
be
the
stronger
writers
in
college
after
graduating
from
our
high
school.
I
did
not
believe
her
and
thought
my
papers
would
once
again
be
covered
in
red
ink
with
my
professorOs
comments
because
I
just
assumed
it
would
be
more
challenging
then
my
high
schoolOs
courses.
However,
from
doing
peer
conferences
in
class
I
could
tell
how
much
stronger
a
writer
I
was
than
my
classmates.
I
have
taken
numerous
writing
courses
since
my
first
year
seminar
and
have
found
that
I
keep
being
challenged
and
my
writing
keeps
developing
as
I
continue.
I
find
this
exciting
and
I
like
to
see
the
progress
I
have
made
just
in
the
two
years
I
have
been
at
Lafayette.
I
have
had
some
assignments
where
it
has
really
taken
me
a
good
deal
of
thought
to
understand
the
assignment
and
nail
a
thesis
down.
I
like
all
my
papers
to
flow
and
I
have
learned
some
great
editing
techniques
on
how
to
do
this
from
one
of
my
professorOs
classes
who
is
fond
of
his
classmates
sharing
work
and
giving
feedback.
By
editing
other
peopleOs
papers,
once
again,
I
have
found
this
to
help
my
writing.
In
my
courses
at
Lafayette
I
have
been
able
to
widen
my
writing
to
include
analyses
of
several
different
works.
A
few
times
these
works
have
included
a
combination
of
poetry,
lyrics,
film,
and
books.
I
found
this
type
of
writing
difficult
to
do
at
first
but
have
managed
to
successfully
integrate
these
different
works
into
one
solid
paper.
Looking
at
my
generation
can
explain
the
style
of
my
writing
method.
My
generation
was
growing
up
after
the
typewriter
era
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
popularity
of
the
desk
top
computer.
In
elementary
school
my
classroom
had
several
computers
for
student
use
and
I
had
typing
class
on
small
electronic
keyboards.
However,
I
always
wrote
out
my
work
on
paper
before
typing
it
into
a
document.
Typing
a
finished
piece
of
work
was
the
way
teachers
wanted
assignments
turned
in.
I
was
encouraged
to
start
writing
by
brainstorming
and
using
paper
and
pencil
to
create
a
bubble
chart
of
ideas.
Back
then
the
whole
class
did
not
have
access
to
the
computer
at
the
same
time
so
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
start
a
draft
of
writing
at
the
computer
desk.
Also,
not
every
family
owned
a
computer
at
home
as
so
many
do
today.
I
still
actually
write
out
my
writing
in
the
beginning
today,
which
I
did
not
find
unusual
until
I
reached
college
where
everyone
types
eagerly
away
on
papers.
I
like
to
physically
write
down
and
cross
out
and
move
my
sentences
around
on
paper
and
then
type
it.
After
typing
I
will
print
out
a
copy
and
do
the
same
type
of
editing.
I
feel
the
most
comfortable
writing
this
way
and
I
believe
a
child
growing
up
today
with
all
this
technology
probably
will
be
able
to
begin
writing
in
a
Word
document,
along
with
many
other
Lafayette
students,
because
of
the
plethora
of
computers
today.
I
find
it
interesting
to
see
how
different
methods
of
writing
work
for
people.
Through
all
of
my
writing
experiences
I
have
gained
the
knowledge
of
how
to
express
myself.
At
times
I
have
found
writing
so
frustrating
because
it
is
really
hard
to
be
a
good
writer.
At
other
times
I
will
be
in
the
writing
zone
and
will
just
write
on
until
I
complete
an
assignment.
I
like
the
challenge
of
each
piece
of
work
and
I
am
always
interested
in
hearing
the
readerOs
thoughts
that
my
writing
provokes.
Although
my
early
experiences
with
writing
were
not
always
pleasant
ones,
I
have
found
that
my
hard
work
has
paid
off
and
that
I
now
enjoy
writing
and
English.
I
actually
find
it
amusing
that
one
my
majors
is
English
because
even
back
in
high
school
I
still
was
a
more
math-science
loving
student.
I
actually
thought
I
would
be
a
biology
major
but
instead
am
an
English
and
Business
one.
In
completing
this
essay
I
have
begun
to
understand
how
I
got
to
where
I
am
today
not
only
as
a
writer
but
as
a
critical
reader
and
conversant.
I
think
that
my
early
experiences
with
writing
helped
to
shape
me
to
get
to
the
point
of
being
a
strong
writer
today.
