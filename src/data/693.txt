Literacy
Narrative
My
earliest
memory
about
writing
is
perhaps
my
worst.
In
first
grade
I
was
asked
to
write
and
illustrate
a
description
of
what
I
wanted
to
be
when
I
grew
up,
and
upon
presenting
my
finished
work
to
my
teacher,
I
remember
she
laughed,
NA
lady
farmer!O
To
say
that
I
was
indignant,
or
even
appalled,
would
be
to
suggest
that
my
childhood
temper
was
not
a
fiery
one.
To
be
fair,
I
can
now
appreciate
the
humor
she
must
have
found
in
the
phrase,
and
fortunately
my
ability
to
express
myself
in
words,
if
not
in
pictures,
improved
as
I
grew
older.
Still,
for
many
years
I
did
not
consider
myself
a
writer.
I
hated
persuasive
essays,
such
as
the
ones
assigned
throughout
elementary
and
middle
school,
in
which
we
were
most
often
asked
to
write
about
what
we
wanted
as
gifts
for
the
holidays;
the
reports,
for
which
I
always
wrote
about
musicians,
like
Ella
Fitzgerald,
who
my
friends
did
not
know
or
like,
were
only
marginally
better.
I
did
not
care
about
the
topics
and
so
struggled
to
write
about
them,
so
much
so
that
I
was
required
to
rewrite
an
essay
on
animal
cruelty
so
many
times
in
my
sixth
grade
year
that
I
was
the
last
student
to
hand
in
a
final
draft.
Though
the
same
year,
and
indeed
even
the
same
teacher,
would
later
give
me
one
of
the
greatest
compliments
I
received
for
my
writing,
my
eventual
love
of
writing
did
not
grow
out
of
the
school
setting,
but
rather
out
of
my
own
imagination.
In
elementary
school
I
had
touched
creative
writing
only
when
asked.
Aside
from
a
story
written
for
my
NgiftedO
class
in
third
grade,
which
my
teacher
liked
enough
to
ask
for
a
second
copy
to
show
his
other
students,
I
was
not
particularly
creative
in
these
assignments.
More
telling
of
my
early
creative
process
are
multiple
journals
from
second
and
third
grade,
each
filled
with
variations
of
one
story,
which
involves
a
small
animal
who
wanders
away
from
his
home,
is
frightened
by
a
natural
disaster,
and
returns
to
his
family,
his
lesson
well
learned.
After
this
unpromising
start,
in
sixth
grade
I
somehow
managed
to
fall
into
creative
writing,
when
I
finished
reading
a
challenging
book
and
decided
to
write
my
own.
Although
my
early
stories
for
school
had
been
distinctly
uncreative,
I
used
to
Nplan
my
playO
as
a
small
child,
spending
hours
planning
the
story
line
that
I
would
play
out
with
my
toys
after
school,
and
so
creating
a
world
and
a
basic
storyline
was
not
difficult
for
me.
Even
then,
however,
I
was
conscious
that
many
children
try
and
grow
bored
of
writing,
and
I
clearly
remember
believing
that
I
would
write
ten
pagesNtwenty
at
the
mostNbefore
I
lost
interest.
I
did
not.
A
few
weeks
later
I
handed
in
the
first
sixty
pages
to
the
same
sixth
grade
teacher
for
a
vaguely
related
project,
and
not
only
did
she
give
me
an
A+++
for
my
effort,
she
also
announced
to
the
class
that
she
had
Ndiscovered
a
writer!O
Though
she
was
a
truly
terrifying
teacher,
complete
with
an
intense
love
of
grammar
and
followed
by
a
rumor
that
she
smoked
cigarettes
between
classes
in
the
boiler
room,
her
enthusiasm
and
support
was
one
of
the
better
shows
of
encouragement
I
have
still
received.
It
was
during
this
time
that
I
also
consciously
shifted
from
writing
by
hand
to
typing
on
a
computer.
Throughout
my
elementary
and
middle
school
years,
my
older
sister
had
teased
me
mercilessly
about
my
handwriting,
which,
with
retrospect,
I
think
was
no
worse
than
any
small
childOs.
Still,
I
never
used
to
take
such
teasing
lightly.
When
I
first
decided
I
would
write
my
story
on
a
computer,
I
spent
hours
typing
the
alphabet
twice
for
every
font
in
WordNonce
in
uppercase
letters,
once
in
lowercase.
Needless
to
say,
I
quickly
learned
how
to
type
well,
and
I
never
returned
to
writing
by
hand;
I
simply
cannot
write
fast
enough
to
keep
up
with
my
thoughts,
and
I
am
forever
deleting
and
rewriting
even
in
rough
drafts.
Armed
with
an
old
laptop
of
the
familyOs,
I
completed
my
first
book
at
over
200
single-spaced
pages
about
nine
months
after
typing
the
first
word.
A
few
months
later,
my
book,
called
The
Silvercatcher,
won
an
award
and
was
published
in
my
hometownOs
public
library,
which
was
felt
like
a
huge
accomplishment
at
the
time.
Afterwards,
however,
I
became
incredibly
closed
about
my
writing.
Though
I
left
middle
school
with
seven
completed
books,
aside
from
one
close
and
incredibly
supportive
friend
I
did
not
show
my
writing
to
anyone
else,
including
my
own
parents,
and
actually
developed
a
debilitating
fear
of
talking
about
it.
This
self-consciousness
was
a
result
largely
of
my
personality,
for
I
have
always
kept
my
passions
close,
but
also
I
think
some
small
part
of
my
fear
might
have
to
do
with
the
English
teachers
I
had
in
the
seventh
through
tenth
grades.
I
had
entered
seventh
grade
fairly
confident
that
I
could
express
myself
with
words
at
least
creatively,
and,
after
rigorous
lessons
in
sixth
grade
and
a
great
deal
of
reading
on
my
own
time,
I
not
only
knew,
but
indeed
liked,
grammar.
Unfortunately,
however,
I
was
not
close
with
my
seventh
grade
English
teacher.
I
think
she
even
disliked
me,
or
at
the
very
least
she
ignored
me
in
class,
despite
the
fact
that
I
was
one
of
the
few
students
who
always
willingly
participated
in
class.
My
parents
often
joke
that
I
did
not
speak
until
seventh
grade,
and,
to
an
extent,
this
is
true;
I
was
an
incredibly
quiet
and
reserved
child
until
this
time,
and
I
wonder
if
my
confidence
in
my
writing
would
have
developed
differently
if
I
had
had
a
teacher
who
showed
any
support
or
interest
in
me.
It
was,
at
any
rate,
this
year
that
I
stopped
talking
to
my
parents
and
teachers
about
my
writing.
My
next
three
teachers,
including
two
for
Honors
English
in
early
high
school,
considered
me
a
good
student
in
class
and
were
complimentary
of
my
essays,
although
I
made
no
effort
to
tell
them
of
my
creative
writing.
Still
uninterested
by
the
middle
school
persuasive
essays
and
standard
book
reports,
I
was
grateful
to
begin
writing
essays
on
literature
during
this
time,
and
I
grew
more
confident
that
I
could
write
analytically
as
well
as
creatively.
However,
though
I
always
received
high
grades
on
writing
assignments,
I
was
never
close
to
these
teachers.
Eleventh
grade
was
different.
I
was
placed
late
into
a
class
with
a
young
male
teacher
bent
on
using
tough
love
as
a
means
to
push
his
students
to
ask
harder
questions,
and
in
my
determination
to
prove
he
would
not
regret
admitting
me
into
the
class,
I
have
never
thrived
more
in
an
English
class.
Though
we
frequently
butted
heads
in
our
ideas
about
writing
and
about
literature,
and
though
there
were
days
I
thought
I
despised
the
man,
this
teacher
once
told
me,
NMany
times,
I
felt
like
you
alone
were
the
class.O
I
felt
valued
by
the
teacher
and
discovered
that
I
did
not
have
to
be
a
passive
student
or
writer
in
school;
I
could
disagree
and
form
my
own
opinions,
which
I
was
free
to
explore.
In
this
class
I
wrote
an
essay
comparing
The
Bell
Jar
by
Sylvia
Plath
and
Nineteen
Eighty-Four
by
George
Orwell,
and
though
he
gave
me
the
most
criticism
I
received
for
any
other
paper
throughout
high
school
or
even
during
my
first
year
of
college,
I
was
prouder
of
that
paper
than
any
other
I
had
written
by
that
year.
It
was
also
during
this
class
that
I
recovered
from
a
brief,
but
powerful,
fear
that
I
had
reached
my
NpeakO
in
creative
writing.
The
previous
summer
I
had
completed
nine
books
in
my
first
series
and
felt
I
had
nowhere
left
to
go
in
the
world
I
had
created.
I
was
terrified
by
this
thought,
and
the
six
months
or
so
that
I
did
not
write
left
me
depressed
and
uncertain
how
to
proceed.
Thankfully,
as
a
result
of
the
intellectual
stimulation
and
support
I
received
in
this
teacherOs
class,
I
developed
an
idea
for
a
new
series
that
year
and
quickly
finished
the
first
book,
in
which
I
challenged
myself
to
explore
new
types
of
characters
and
stories.
The
following
year
was
the
first
time
I
had
an
English
teacher
that
my
sister
had
also
had
during
high
school.
Given
the
fact
that
my
sister
graduated
college
as
an
English
major
that
same
year,
this
had
initially
intimidated
me,
particularly
as
I
knew
this
English
teacher
had
loved
Elena
in
high
school.
However,
this
eccentric
woman,
the
opposite
of
my
previous
teacher
in
both
manner
and
style
of
teaching,
was
enthusiastic
about
my
writing
and
later
told
me
that
I
was
Nthat
studentO
in
her
class.
Together,
she
and
my
eleventh
grade
English
teacher
gave
me
incredible
confidence
that
I
could
conquer
any
writing
assignment
and
certainly
prepared
me
for
college
writing.
Fortunately,
some
of
this
confidence
also
transferred
to
my
creative
writing.
I
had
grown
apart
from
my
sole
middle
school
reader,
although
I
gained
two
close
friends
in
early
high
school
who
would
discuss
my
writing
for
hours
at
a
time
with
me.
I
grew
to
love
to
talk
about
my
writing
with
them,
and
therefore
to
feel
proud
of
it,
which
was
essential
for
my
college
search
and
application
process.
It
was
still
a
struggle
for
me
to
talk
about
my
writing
and
give
samples
to
colleges,
but
I
knew
that
I
would
not
want
to
attend
a
school
that
was
not
interested
in
helping
me
with
my
writing.
After
my
experience
with
these
two
English
teachers
late
in
high
school,
I
did
not
want
to
return
to
having
instructors
that
would
not
be
just
as
supportive,
challenging,
or
encouraging.
Between
the
emphasis
on
writing
in
the
curriculum
and
an
invitation
to
join
the
Creative
and
Performing
Arts
Fellowship
for
my
creative
writing,
Lafayette
promised
me
this
sort
of
active
relationship
with
professors.
Starting
first
semester,
I
had
many
opportunities
to
write
in
class.
For
my
First
Year
Seminar,
I
wrote
a
research
paper
on
the
former
Yugoslavia,
a
subject
about
which
I
knew
nothing.
Though
the
paper
was
supposed
to
be
fourteen
pagesNalready
longer
than
any
paper
I
had
ever
been
asked
to
write
in
high
schoolNI
loved
learning
about
my
topic
and
wrote
almost
double
the
amount.
The
assignment
had
been
daunting,
but
the
small
steps
set
for
us
in
the
FYS
were
designed
to
help
us
chip
away
at
the
research
and
writing
throughout
the
semester.
Though
I
was
nervous
about
the
assignment
at
first,
I
still
had
the
confidence
from
high
school
to
tackle
it,
and
upon
its
completion
I
felt
empowered
by
the
knowledge
that
I
had
pushed
my
writing
farther
than
before
and
had
still
succeeded.
A
History
class
first
semester
also
required
a
research
paper,
though
we
were
free
to
choose
any
topic
we
had
covered
throughout
the
semester.
The
class
was
History
of
the
Modern
World;
we
had
covered
NeverythingO
from
1300
until
the
present
throughout
all
countries
and
continents.
Between
this
paper,
in
which
I
compared
GandhiOs
nonviolence
movement
and
the
Mau
Mau
Rebellion
in
Kenya,
and
the
one
for
my
FYS,
I
had
a
chance
to
write
significantly
longer
research
papers
than
I
had
ever
been
assigned
in
high
school;
I
also
had
a
chance
to
choose
new
topics
that
were
genuinely
of
interest
to
me.
I
loved
writing
these
papers.
For
the
first
time,
I
felt
a
real
connection
between
my
creative
writing,
for
which
I
am
constantly
researching
different
cultures
and
histories
out,
and
the
writing
I
was
asked
to
do
for
class.
I
also
had
a
chance
to
explore
my
creative
writing
in
new
ways
my
first
year.
My
advisor
met
with
me
weekly,
read
my
latest
three
books,
and
started
a
reading
group
with
me
to
discuss
books
in
similar
genres
and
styles.
Though
not
a
Creative
Writing
professor,
she
was
both
supportive
and
interested,
and
she
was
the
first
teacher
with
whom
I
openly
talked
about
my
writing.
The
CaPA
Fellowship
requires
that
I
create
a
project
for
my
creative
writing.
For
the
first
time,
I
have
something
of
a
deadline
to
work
with,
and
I
have
decided
to
continuing
working
with
the
series
I
started
in
eleventh
grade.
I
finished
the
fourth
book
during
winter
break
this
year
and
plan
to
edit
the
existing
books
(again)
and
finish
two
more
for
a
complete
series
by
the
time
I
graduate.
Our
coordinator
is
undyingly
enthusiastic
about
all
our
projects,
and
CaPA
is
a
whole
support
system
of
writers
and
other
artists
to
encourage
me
as
well.
Second
semester,
I
also
took
Creative
Writing
to
develop
writing
techniques.
This
class
pushed
me
to
explore
forms
of
writing
I
had
not
previously
touched,
such
as
poetry
and
short
fiction.
After
seven
years
of
writing
only
long
fiction,
it
was
difficult
to
try
something
new,
but
the
class
was
supportive,
friendly,
and
encouraging.
The
class
was
structured
so
that
we
most
often
heard
feedback
from
the
other
students
in
workshops,
both
big
and
small,
so
that
we
learned
how
to
not
only
give,
but
also
take,
constructive
criticism.
The
act
of
thinking
and
speaking
critically,
and
yet
supportively,
about
anotherOs
writing
was
beneficial
when
I
then
had
to
criticize
my
own
writing,
particularly
as
everyoneOs
work
was
raw
and
new.
Of
course,
hearing
feedback
from
the
professor
and
the
other
students
also
helped
me
view
my
own
work,
from
syntax
to
style,
with
a
more
critical
eye,
and
this
new
perspective
was
not
limited
to
my
poetry
for
class,
which
I
now
know
is
definitely
not
my
strongest
means
of
expression,
nor
even
to
my
books.
Understanding
the
arc
of
a
story
is
related
to
understanding
the
arc
of
an
argument,
and
effective
syntax,
sentence
structure,
and
style
are
essential
for
every
piece
of
writing,
no
matter
if
it
is
creative
or
analytical.
For
me,
the
greatest
challenge
about
writing
has
been
and
continues
to
be
opening
myself
up
to
talking
to
people
about
it.
My
parents
have
read
the
first
three
books
of
my
second
series
and
are
supportive,
but
I
find
they
frequently
change
the
subject
when
I
bring
it
up,
not
out
of
lack
of
care
but
rather
because
they
simply
do
not
know
what
to
say
to
help
me.
My
sister
has
never
opened
any
of
my
books.
Though
I
have
no
difficulties
approaching
a
professor
to
talk
about
analytical
or
research
papers,
I
got
tongue-tied
when
talking
to
my
Creative
Writing
professor
about
fiction.
These
facts
are
disheartening,
but
I
know
that
I
am
still
in
the
process
of
learning,
of
shaping
my
style,
of
gaining
confidence,
and
I
am
thrilled
to
have
a
chance
now
to
reflect
on
how
far
the
process
has
already
taken
me.
As
I
finish
rewriting
a
book
for
the
fifth
time
this
summer,
and
as
I
proofread
this
essay
again
and
again,
I
am
reminded
that
we
never
conquer
language,
just
as
we
never
stop
learning
to
express
ourselves
in
more
effective
ways.
The
opportunity
to
continually
learn
is
exciting
to
me,
particularly
as
my
creative
and
analytical
writings
grow
more
and
more
related,
and
I
look
forward
to
seeing
how
the
process
develops.
