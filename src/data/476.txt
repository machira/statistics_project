Returning
Writing
Associate
Prof.
Bianca
Falbo
History
as
a
Writer
Over
my
past
three
years
as
an
English
major
and
this
past
fall
semester
as
a
member
of
the
Writing
Associate
program
at
Lafayette,
I
have
discovered
the
importance
of
writing
in
oneOs
life.
As
an
English
major,
my
past
three
years
in
academia
have
consisted
of
reading
and
writing
constantly.
When
I
look
back
on
the
papers
I
wrote
as
a
freshman
and
sophomore,
I
laugh
to
see
how
my
writing
style
has
changed,
improved
and
developed
with
each
paper
that
I
wrote
during
the
course
of
my
education
at
Lafayette.
However,
while
I
might
find
my
writing
style
as
an
18
year
old
to
be
amusing,
it
is
also
incredibly
interesting
to
think
that
it
just
three
short
years,
my
furthered
education
has
given
breath
to
my
own
writing:
my
writing
has
developed
its
own
style
that
is
constantly
progressing
every
time
I
choose
to
open
up
Microsoft
Word
on
my
lap
top.
This
is
why,
as
I
read
the
description
of
this
assignment,
an
interesting
thought
occurred
to
me.
My
history
as
a
writer
is
completely
unique
to
me
because
I
consider
writing
a
reflection
of
who
I
am.
As
my
writing
style,
my
technique,
my
methods
of
writing
and
even
my
diction
has
changed
throughout
the
past
year,
so
have
I.
A
simple
explanation
may
be
that,
over
the
course
of
the
past
9
months,
I
began
to
see
the
world
differently.
As
a
result
of
looking
through
the
world
through
a
different
lens,
I
began
to
read
books
through
a
different
perspective
which
was
a
catalyst
for
a
change
in
my
writing.
During
the
fall
semester
of
my
junior
year
at
Lafayette,
I
noticed
how
my
writing
had
matured
along
with
my
ideas
and
my
thought
process
as
well.
This
all
resulted
from
growing
older,
learning
more
and,
inevitably,
growing
up.
However,
nothing
could
have
prepared
me
for
the
change
that
would
occur
within
in
me,
and
therefore
within
my
writing
as
well,
as
the
time
I
spent
studying
abroad.
In
February
of
2005,
I
departed
OOHare
International
Airport
on
a
direct
flight
to
Buenos
Aires,
Argentina.
When
I
first
set
foot
into
the
completely
foreign
land,
it
was
a
miracle
that
I
could
walk
because
I
could
barely
breathe.
I
had
been
a
bundle
of
nerves
for
weeks,
waiting
for
my
departure
to
Buenos
Aires,
and
as
I
waited
in
line
during
customs,
I
felt
a
mixture
of
unbridled
excitement
and
complete
and
utter
fear.
I
had
taken
Spanish
courses
in
high
school
and
college,
but
I
quickly
learned
that
the
language
you
learn
in
school
is
completely
unlike
that
which
is
spoken
in
a
foreign
country.
I
was
to
live
with
an
Argentine
family,
take
classes
with
real
portenos
(a
Buenos
Aires
born
citizen)
in
Argentine
universities,
and
somehow
make
a
life
for
myself
in
a
bustling
city
of
8
million
inhabitants.
The
first
two
weeks
were
bitter
sweet:
the
excitement
of
the
city
and
the
newness
of
the
experience
thrilled
me,
but
I
was
still
unsure
of
myself
as
I
struggled
to
speak
the
language,
make
new
friends
and
fit
in
with
my
host
family.
Eventually
however,
I
found
myself
completely
adjusted
to
the
new
life
I
had
in
Buenos
Aires.
I
began
to
speak
Spanish
with
ease,
and
difficult
verb
conjugations
and
slang
escaped
from
my
lips
as
easily
as
English
once
had.
One
day,
magically,
I
sat
down
at
the
dinner
table
and
understood
every
single
word
my
host
brothers
said
as
they
sat
across
the
table
from
me
punching
each
other.
Suddenly,
I
had
made
Argentine
friends
in
my
classes
and
was
attending
parties
with
Argentine
students,
who
sat
cross
legged
and
chain
smoking
their
Philip
Morris
cigarettes
before
they
went
to
the
boliches
(clubs).
Tango
shows,
big
steak
dinners,
caf
con
leche,
dinner
at
10
PM,
dancing
until
7
AME.wait
a
minute,
I
seem
to
be
getting
ahead
of
myself.
Yes,
I
should
remind
you
that
studying
was
also
involved.
I
took
5
classes
at
Universidad
del
Salvador,
in
two
different
facultades:
Letras
(Literature)
and
Ciencias
Sociales
(Social
Sciences,
which
includes
history
and
sociology).
The
first
day
of
class
my
jaw
almost
dropped
to
the
floor
as
I
sat
listening
(but
not
understanding)
the
professors
speak
and
my
stomach
began
to
squirm
as
I
realized
what
was
expected
of
me
as
a
student.
Like
the
local
students,
I
was
to
take
tests,
give
presentations
and
write
several
papers
throughout
the
semester,
all
in
Spanish.
Homework
in
English
is
hard
enough,
but
I
believe
my
forehead
began
to
sweat
as
I
thought
about
being
graded
by
real
Argentine
professors
for
the
caliber
of
my
work
in
a
different
language.
Not
to
mention,
my
grades
were
going
to
transfer
directly
to
my
GPA.
Obviously
I
had
written
papers
in
Spanish
before,
but
that
had
been
in
an
American
university,
where
all
of
my
classmates
and
I
struggled
together
to
make
ourselves
understood
by
the
professor.
At
Salvador,
I
was
often
the
only
extranjera
(foreigner)
in
my
class
and
I
sincerely
doubted
whether
the
professor
would
enjoy
reading
my
papers,
which
I
considered
to
be
somewhere
around
the
5th
grade
level.
However,
as
time
flew
by,
writing
in
Spanish
became
less
and
less
of
a
struggle.
During
my
time
in
Buenos
Aires
I
learned
that
speaking
and
writing
in
another
language
gives
you
a
completely
different
perspective
on
your
own
language,
both
in
spoken
and
written
form.
I
began
to
understand
how
truly
important
language
is,
and
the
staggering
power
that
a
single
word
maintains
in
a
language.
I
once
got
in
an
argument
with
an
Argentine
friend
over
the
miscommunication
of
a
single
word:
the
word
I
had
translated
from
English
to
Spanish
had
changed
the
meaning
of
my
explanation
from
acceptable
to
offensive.
I
learned
that
diction
is
incredibly
important
when
learning
another
language,
because
meaning
is
often
lost
in
translation
through
poor
word
choice.
As
my
Spanglish
developed,
I
found
words
in
Spanish
that
seemed
more
powerful
than
the
same
words
in
English,
and
substituted
them
often
when
talking
with
my
American
friends.
In
general,
I
became
incredibly
aware
of
the
power
of
the
word,
both
in
my
Spanish
and
English
writing.
Although
I
was
doing
all
of
my
school
work
in
Spanish,
I
kept
up
with
my
English
writing
in
my
journal.
As
the
semester
progressed,
my
journal
became
increasingly
more
and
more
in
Spanglish
but
I
found
my
journal
incredibly
important
for
several
reasons.
First
of
all,
I
was
currently
undergoing
the
most
exciting
and
incredible
semester
of
my
life
and
I
didnOt
want
to
forget
a
single
second.
Second
of
all,
I
discovered
that
as
time
passed,
my
English
speaking
and
writing
was
becoming
poorer
as
my
Spanish
improved.
When
talking
on
the
phone
with
my
parents,
I
would
be
speaking
English
while
using
the
Spanish
grammatical
structure.
(For
example,
instead
of
saying
NI
am
tallerO
I
would
say
NI
am
more
tallO.)
This
horrified
me,
because
I
knew
that
my
writing
in
English
must
also
be
heading
downhillNsomething
that
is
absolutely
devastating
to
an
English
major.
I
worked
hard
to
constantly
write
in
my
journal,
recording
my
days,
conversations,
thoughts
and
experiences
in
a
small,
hard
covered
book
that
I
soon
came
to
treasure.
I
wanted
to
record
an
experience
in
my
life
in
which
I
felt
incredibly
alive
and
therefore,
my
writing
reflected
this
sensation
and
became
vivid
and
alive
also.
Now
that
IOm
back
in
that
states,
and
am
desperately
homesick
for
South
America,
my
writing
is
a
comfort
to
me
because
it
allows
my
experience
to
stay
alive
within
the
confines
of
my
own
mind.
Despite
the
constant
journal
writing
during
my
stay
in
Buenos
Aires,
as
I
write
this
paper,
the
first
English
paper
I
have
written
since
December,
I
find
my
mind
muddled
with
two
different
languages
and
flooded
with
Spanish
words.
I
had
just
returned
from
Argentina
3
days
ago
when
I
opened
up
my
mail
and
discovered
that
I
had
write
and
mail
this
assignment
within
the
next
7
days.
To
my
amusement,
I
was
actually
both
relieved
and
annoyed
at
the
same
time.
I
was
relieved
because
after
spending
6
months
in
a
different
country,
my
life
had
suddenly
become
incredibly
easier
when
I
returned
home
because
everything
was
in
my
native
language.
Therefore,
an
assignment
in
English
seemed
like
a
piece
of
cake.
The
sensation
of
annoyance
overtakes
me
while
I
write
this
also,
because
I
find
myself
laboring
for
words
in
English
that
I
feel
are
more
precise
and
meaningful
in
Spanish.
While
there
are
words
in
English
that
donOt
exist
in
other
languages,
for
example
the
words
NrandomO
and
NawkwardO,
the
Spanish
language
also
has
hundreds
of
words
that
cannot
be
depicted
in
our
lingo.
As
I
mentioned
earlier,
I
am
discovering
that
my
history
as
a
writer
has
changed
over
the
past
year,
because
I
have
realized
that
a
word,
a
single
word,
is
the
powerful
backbone
of
language.
As
a
writer,
I
have
become
even
more
conscious
of
the
importance
of
my
diction,
because
each
word
has
a
specific
and
particular
meaning
that
can
change
the
tone,
character
and
significance
of
a
sentence.
The
ways
in
which
my
history
as
a
writer
has
changed
over
the
course
of
the
past
year
is,
of
course,
going
to
change
my
role
as
a
WA.
I
am
going
to
increasingly
stress
the
importance
of
diction,
and
I
want
the
students
to
begin
to
understand
the
power
of
a
word,
as
I
learned
this
year.
I
will
continue
to
strongly
encourage
the
students
write
several
drafts
of
their
work,
for
as
I
learned
with
my
Spanish
professors,
this
is
the
quickest
and
easiest
manner
to
improve
your
writing
as
well
as
the
caliber
of
your
work.
Finally,
and
most
importantly,
my
relationship
with
foreign
students
will
have
completely
changed.
Not
only
will
have
the
utmost
respect
and
patience
for
a
student
who
is
bold
enough
to
brave
another
country
and
attempt
to
master
another
language,
but
I
will
also
have
a
better
understanding
as
to
how
to
read
their
papers.
Often
times
in
the
past
semester,
I
couldnOt
exactly
understand
certain
phrases
and
was
often
confused
as
to
the
direction
they
were
headed
with
their
papers.
Now
that
I
can
fully
comprehend
the
difference
between
certain
languages,
I
believe
that
I
can
be
of
more
help
to
foreign
students.
When
I
find
the
incorrect
use
of
a
word
or
a
phrase
during
a
conference,
I
will
change
my
usual
strategy
and
work
together
with
the
student
in
order
to
find
the
correct
word.
I
feel
that
this
collaboration
will
allow
my
role
as
a
WA
to
improve
because
a
better
understanding
of
another
language
gives
you
an
entirely
new
perspective
on
your
own
language,
improving
your
own
writing
and
how
you
view
the
writing
of
others.
