I
donOt
consider
myself
to
be
a
stellar
writer,
however
an
adequate
one.
IOve
always
been
able
to
explain
myself
clearly
and
get
my
point
across
but
in
terms
of
producing
a
piece
of
writing
that
is
worth
remembering,
I
donOt
see
any
of
my
pieces
as
falling
under
that
category.
My
first
attempts
at
writing
were
met
with
mild
success.
In
grade
school,
particularly
third,
fourth
and
fifth
grade,
we
were
asked
to
write
our
own
pieces
of
fiction.
The
NworkO
that
I
am
most
proud
of
is
actually
a
creative
writing
piece
I
wrote
in
the
third
grade
entitled
NHow
the
Penguins
Lost
their
Flight.O
I
wrote
about
how
the
generous
penguin
Snowy
gave
all
of
her
feathers
away
to
her
friends
to
help
them
survive
the
cold
winter.
As
a
result,
Snowy
could
no
longer
fly.
I
suppose
the
moral
of
that
story
was
that
in
order
to
help
others
you
have
to
make
some
sacrifices
and
compromises
and
yet
even
with
these
setbacks
you
still
feel
extremely
rewarded.
Snowy
could
no
longer
fly
and
yet
it
did
not
matter
to
her
because
all
of
her
friends
were
safe
and
warm.
IOm
not
sure
that
my
nine-year-old
self
was
aware
of
the
morally
sound
story
I
had
written,
however,
when
I
was
picked
to
attend
a
young
writers
conference
I
sure
felt
special.
Writing
is
not
an
ability
you
are
born
with.
It
requires
teaching
and
learning,
therefore
producing
varying
levels
amongst
individuals
and
fostering
a
competitive
atmosphere.
That
young
writerOs
conference
is
proof
of
this
tendency
to
compete,
to
set
certain
people
aside
and
give
them
praise.
In
light
of
this,
writing
can
also
be
viewed
as
a
privilege
of
the
well
educated.
Some
of
the
first
skills
that
are
taught
to
children
are
reading
and
writing.
Being
able
to
communicate
well
is
a
skill
that
separates
people
from
differing
socioeconomic
statuses.
As
a
consequence
inferiority
complexes
begin
to
develop
and
otherwise
intelligent
individuals
are
discouraged
and
fall
into
a
detrimental
cycle
of
self-worthlessness.
A
piece
of
writing
is
a
very
personal
thing
and
letting
others
view
your
writing
can
be
quite
unnerving.
Throughout
middle
school
and
high
school
I
always
dreaded
peer
editing.
Many
conclusions
regarding
a
personOs
intelligence
level
can
be
drawn
according
to
their
level
of
writing.
Even
though
I
knew
that
peer
editing
would
only
help
me
in
the
end
to
produce
a
better,
more
advanced
piece
of
writing,
I
would
rather
have
gotten
back
my
paper
without
any
marks
than
see
it
with
sentences
crossed
out
or
long
comments
in
the
margins.
To
me,
it
was
an
attack
on
my
own
competence
as
a
student
and
many
times
I
felt
that
my
integrity
had
been
given
a
large
blow.
However,
itOs
all
a
part
of
growing
and
becoming
more
mature.
I
learned
that
criticism
should
be
viewed
as
constructive
and
as
a
means
to
improve
your
writing,
not
as
a
means
to
discourage
you
from
writing.
Even
though
as
a
college
senior
I
can
say
that
I
have
matured
and
grown
immensely
over
the
past
three
years,
I
still
have
many
issues
with
confidence.
As
I
stated
earlier,
IOve
never
considered
myself
to
be
a
strong
writer.
IOve
always
been
quite
apprehensive
about
showing
anyone,
even
my
closest
friends,
my
writing.
I
would
always
preface
it
with
Noh,
itOs
really
not
that
good,O
or
NI
didnOt
have
a
lot
of
time
to
work
on
it,O
or
Nthe
topic
wasnOt
good
for
me
because
I
wasnOt
interested
in
it.O
Saying
these
things
would
in
effect
save
me
from
embarrassment
in
the
event
that
the
reader
really
didnOt
like
my
work.
Last
year
during
one
of
my
upper
level
psychology
labs,
my
professor
read
out-loud
to
the
class
one
of
my
classmateOs
papers
that
she
found
to
be
very
effective.
We
were
assigned
a
short
essay,
two
to
three
pages,
debating
a
chosen
view
point
on
an
article
we
had
read.
As
soon
as
she
started
reading
I
realized
she
had
picked
my
paper.
I
was
extremely
flattered
to
have
been
chosen
from
amongst
the
group
of
about
30
or
so
students,
however
at
the
same
time,
I
felt
incredibly
embarrassed
and
almost
horror-struck.
I
thought
the
paper
I
had
written
was
mediocre.
I
couldnOt
see
how
I
deserved
to
have
it
read
in
front
of
the
entire
class.
As
I
listened
to
her
read
it,
I
felt
sure
the
other
students
were
wondering
why
on
earth
that
paper
was
picked.
To
me
it
sounded
as
though
a
15
year-old
had
written
it.
I
was
down
on
myself
the
rest
of
the
day.
An
event
that
would
have
made
anyone
else
feel
quite
proud
and
pleased
with
themselves,
made
me
feel
like
an
inadequate
fraud.
I
suppose
my
feelings
of
mediocrity
stemmed
from
my
early
schooling.
I
was
never
one
of
the
Nsmart
kidsO
in
my
grade
school
classes.
But
I
never
considered
myself
nor
do
I
think
anyone
else
considered
me
to
be
a
slacker.
I
was
always
somewhere
in
the
middle.
When
we
were
first
learning
to
read
in
kindergarten,
first,
and
second
grade,
we
were
put
into
reading
groups
based
on
our
skills.
I
think
immediately
I
felt
a
bit
ostracized
from
the
so
called
NsmarterO
kids.
I
was
a
good
reader,
but
slow
and
needed
a
bit
more
time
to
comprehend
everything
I
had
just
read.
I
also
had
trouble
multitasking.
To
this
day
I
need
complete
silence
to
do
any
kind
of
work,
especially
if
it
involves
large
amounts
of
reading.
But
of
course
that
doesnOt
mean
IOm
any
less
intelligent
that
those
kids
who
were
put
in
the
most
advanced
reading
group.
It
just
meant
that
I
needed
more
time.
However
I
didnOt
realize
this
as
a
young
child
and
so
I
began
to
develop
a
slight
inferiority
complex
which
in
turn
messed
with
my
confidence
level.
-------------------------------------------------------
My
junior
year
of
high
school
meant
that
I
was
to
have
Mrs.
Longo
for
British
Literature.
I
had
heard
many
things
about
her,
both
good
and
bad,
and
overall
I
was
intimidated.
Everything
about
the
class
intimidated
me,
including
the
name.
British
Literature
just
screamed
difficult.
And
it
was.
Mrs.
Longo
was
not
an
easy
teacher.
But
I
really
do
feel
that
I
learned
quite
a
bit
from
her.
Our
most
challenging
assignment
that
year
was
to
write
a
research
paper
discussing
why
ShakespeareOs
Macbeth
was
a
tragic
hero.
It
was
my
first
time
dealing
with
actual
articles
from
well-to-do
literary
magazines.
We
had
to
go
to
the
library
as
a
class
and
be
lectured
on
how
to
use
the
search
engine.
After
we
gathered
enough
information
to
make
a
go
at
proving
our
thesis,
we
went
back
to
the
classroom
where
Mrs.
Longo
gave
us
worksheets
with
specific
instructions
on
how
to
write
an
effective
research
paper.
For
each
body
paragraph
you
needed
a
topic
sentence,
a
lead-in
sentence
for
the
quote,
the
quote
(from
the
play),
an
explanation
of
why
the
quote
is
important,
another
lead-in
sentence,
another
quote
(from
a
literary
critic),
a
lead-in
sentence
for
the
final
quote,
the
final
quote
(again
from
the
play),
a
sentence
explaining
the
quote,
and
finally
the
closing
sentence
reminding
us
of
the
thesis.
The
exceptions
to
this
formula
were
the
introduction
and
conclusion.
The
introduction
served
as
an
overview
of
the
paper
and
foreshadowed
what
the
reader
was
to
expect.
The
purpose
of
the
conclusion
was
to
remind
the
reader
of
the
thesis
statement
and
provide
some
closure
to
the
paper.
The
last
sentence
of
the
introduction
was
always
the
thesis
statement,
while
the
last
sentence
of
the
conclusion
was
always
a
quote.
Mrs.
Longo
would
preach
to
us
about
how
she
was
doing
us
a
favor
by
showing
us
step-by-step
how
to
write
the
research
paper.
She
told
us
to
keep
everything
she
gave
us
because
we
would
without
a
doubt
be
using
it
again
in
the
years
to
come.
I
came
out
of
that
class
feeling
confident
in
my
writing
abilities,
because
after
all
I
basically
had
the
recipe
in
my
back
pocket
for
reference.
Ironically,
this
formula
would
come
in
handy
later
in
my
college
career,
but
not
for
the
classes
I
thought
it
would.
Since
most
of
my
so
called
NEnglishO
classes
in
college
have
been
based
on
rather
eclectic
topics-
West
African
drumming
and
technology-based
theater
-
I
didnOt
have
much
need
for
Mrs.
LongoOs
methods.
It
was
not
until
I
started
taking
classes
on
Spanish
literature
that
I
was
able
to
use
these
skills
again.
IOve
always
had
a
fascination
with
learning
languages.
I
just
found
people
who
were
bilingual
to
be
extremely
well-spoken
and
cultured.
I
thought
and
still
think
that
it
is
very
important
to
expose
yourself
to
other
cultures
and
the
best
way
to
do
that
is
through
learning
another
language.
IOm
so
glad
that
IOve
been
able
to
expand
my
knowledge
on
the
Spanish
language
here
at
Lafayette.
Even
though
IOve
been
taking
Spanish
since
the
seventh
grade,
it
was
only
until
I
came
to
Lafayette
that
I
was
able
to
utilize
the
skills
I
had
learned.
I
placed
into
Intermediate
Spanish,
even
though
with
my
background
in
retrospect,
I
should
have
been
placed
into
a
more
advanced
level.
However,
IOm
really
glad
that
I
was
given
the
opportunity
to
sort
of
hone
in
on
my
grammar
and
reading
comprehension
abilities
which
would
later
serve
as
the
basis
for
my
upper-level
classes.
Since
the
start
of
freshman
year,
I
have
always
looked
forward
to
going
to
Spanish
class,
because
not
only
do
you
realize
the
values
of
learning
another
language,
but
you
learn
quite
a
bit
about
the
culture
that
surrounds
it.
Sophomore
year
I
progressed
to
Advanced
Spanish.
It
was
a
huge
jump
from
intermediate
and
I
had
to
take
some
time
to
get
used
to
the
up-tempo
flow
of
the
lectures.
While
there
was
still
quite
a
bit
of
grammar
taught,
the
focus
was
clearly
more
on
reading
and
writing.
We
read
two
major
works
of
literature
that
semester,
one
famous
play
La
casa
de
Bernarda
Alba,
by
Federico
Garcia
Lorca,
and
El
coronel
no
tiene
quien
le
escribe,
a
novel
by
Gabriel
Garcia
Marquez.
It
was
my
first
time
being
exposed
to
Spanish/Latin
American
novel
and
in
the
beginning
it
was
extremely
difficult
keeping
up
with
the
reading
and
participating
in
class.
I
remember
having
to
look
up
every
other
word
and
thinking
to
myself,
NWhat
on
earth
have
I
got
myself
into?O
But
eventually
I
got
the
hang
of
it
and
I
could
really
sense
a
sort
of
progression
regarding
my
abilities
as
a
critical
reader
of
Spanish
literature.
It
feels
like
IOve
taken
so
many
literature
classes
in
the
Spanish
department
by
now
that
IOve
lost
track
of
how
many
book
IOve
read
and
for
which
classes.
However,
I
donOt
think
I
really
realized
how
much
IOve
grown
as
a
writer
until
the
second
semester
of
my
junior
year.
That
semester
I
found
myself
studying
in
Madrid,
Spain,
a
whole
other
world
compared
to
the
College
Hill
Bubble.
During
my
time
there
I
was
able
to
take
a
literature
class
focusing
on
the
more
modern
writers
that
Spain
has
produced.
Professor
Paloma
Losada
of
the
Universidad
Complutense
de
Madrid
played
an
integral
role
in
my
education
and
I
learned
so
much
about
the
themes
that
characterize
Spanish
literature
of
the
20th
century.
It
was
such
a
breath
of
fresh
air
compared
to
the
16th
century
novel
I
was
reading
during
the
previous
semester
and
it
gave
me
a
chance
to
really
get
inside
the
heads
of
the
writers
who
are
exerting
their
influence
over
the
public
today
and
have
been
throughout
the
past
century.
PalomaOs
teaching
methods
seemed
a
bit
unconventional
to
me
however
proved
much
more
effective
in
the
end
than
what
I
was
used
to.
For
each
class
she
had
us
read
a
certain
number
of
chapters
of
the
book
we
were
reading
at
the
time,
and
we
went
over
the
plot
and
the
corresponding
underlying
themes
chapter
by
chapter.
She
never
assigned
reading
comprehension
questions
like
my
previous
professors
would
do,
nor
did
she
ever
write
formal
notes
up
on
the
board.
She
ran
the
class
like
one
big
discussion,
and
even
though
she
was
the
Ndiscussion
leader,O
our
thoughts
and
ideas,
that
is
to
say
the
studentOs
thoughts
and
ideas,
drove
the
conversation.
Furthermore,
of
the
five
books
that
we
read,
we
were
told
to
pick
three
throughout
the
semester
and
write
short
two
to
three
page
essays
on
the
topic
of
our
choice,
relating
it
of
course
to
the
particular
book
we
had
chosen.
For
the
first
time
I
felt
like
I
had
complete
and
utter
ownership
over
what
I
wrote.
It
wasnOt
like
the
professor
was
feeding
me
the
ideas
and
all
I
was
doing
was
translating
them
onto
paper.
No
this
was
different.
These
were
my
thoughts,
my
feelings
typed
up
on
that
piece
of
paper.
I
felt
so
special
because
not
only
was
I
perfecting
my
critical
reading
skills,
but
I
was
perfecting
my
critical
reading
skills
in
Spanish.
For
our
final
project,
we
were
required
to
develop
a
thesis
out
of
one
of
our
smaller
writing
assignments
(regarding
one
of
the
books)
and
continue
to
develop
it,
incorporating
a
second
book
for
the
final
draft.
It
was
during
this
time
when
I
came
to
realize
that
the
Nwriting
process,O
something
so
dear
to
our
hearts
being
WAOs,
is
really
extremely
universal
and
a
tried
and
true
method
to
achieving
your
potential
as
a
writer.
That
semester
was
a
special
one,
not
only
because
I
was
able
to
experience
a
new
culture
from
the
inside
out,
but
also
because
my
skills
as
a
writer
improved
so
much
that
I
was
able
to
gain
more
confidence
in
my
writing
and
finally
feel
good
about
my
work.
I
mean
hey,
if
someone
who
solely
speaks
Spanish
was
able
to
read
my
paper
and
have
more
than
positive
things
to
say
about
it,
then
I
have
to
think
that
IOve
done
something
good.
-------------------------------------------------------
My
experiences
with
writing
have
told
me
that
it
is
an
ongoing
process
with
much
to
learn.
Writing
can
always
be
improved,
which
makes
it
very
tedious,
yet
extremely
rewarding
at
the
same
time.
I
think
that
my
insecurities
about
my
writing
have
served
to
motivate
me
to
improve
and
even
though
my
confidence
has
grown,
my
tendencies
to
self-criticize
have
persisted
and
ultimately
have
shaped
me
into
the
writer
that
I
am
today.
