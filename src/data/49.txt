My
Writing
Experience
WA
Project
for
Workshop
August
28,
1995
Since
the
beginning
of
High
School
writing
has
been
a
means
to
express
both
creative
and
critical
thought.
Before
this
point
however,
writing
seemed
to
be
a
channel
to
develop
my
thoughts,
and
not
necessarily
express
them
in
a
clear
and
concise
manner.
In
many
ways,
this
progression
reflects
my
academic
career.
Throughout
elementary
and
middle
school
the
focus
was
memorization,
but
in
the
ninth
grade
this
began
to
shift
toward
the
development
of
my
academic
confidence
through
critical
thought.
In
Kindergarten
and
the
first
grade,
writing
was
introduced
not
as
a
way
to
argue
or
criticize,
but
a
means
of
expression.
As
simple
or
obvious
as
it
seems
now,
I
learned
that
writing
was
a
way
to
record
speech
and
thought.
In
this
way,
my
mind
was
being
developed
by
learning
that
thinking,
writing,
and
talking
all
were
inseparable.
I
was
not
nearly
ready
to
make
critical
arguments
or
even
express
complicated
ideas,
but
my
abilities
were
surely
being
developed
in
a
way
which
this
would
eventually
be
possible.
My
next
memories
of
writing
were
in
the
fourth
grade,
where
we
read
chapters
from
our
history
book
and
then
had
to
summarize
them
in
under
one
page.
In
retrospect,
it
is
easy
to
recognize
that
my
teacher,
Mr.
Underwood,
was
getting
us
to
concentrate
on
the
understanding
of
material.
If
we
understood
a
chapter
on
Lewis
and
Clark,
then
we
would
be
able
to
recite
their
story
in
a
way
that
was
interesting
and
consistent
with
the
facts.
He
kept
it
easy:
while
our
writing
improved:
we
never
hade
to
make
an
assertion
and
then
defend
it.
As
long
as
we
understood
the
chapter,
then
there
was
little
chance
of
failure.
This
began
to
gradually
change.
By
the
sixth
grade
I
was
doing
reports,
in
which
the
teacher
would
give
the
class
a
series
of
guidelines
that
needed
to
be
followed
for
success.
For
example,
if
we
did
a
report
on
a
country,
then
we
needed
to
cover
its
economy,
culture,
climate,
etc.
While
these
guidelines
were
obviously
important,
they
were
also
very
broad,
which
left
a
great
amount
of
room
for
interpretation.
More
than
any
time
before,
I
was
forced
to
decide
what
was
important,
what
I
should
discuss.
How
far
into
detail
must
I
go?
Writing
was
no
longer
a
completely
objective
exercise.
For
the
first
time,
it
became
a
process.
I
was
forced
to
approach
writing
with
a
much
more
subjective
mind.
I
saw
that,
depending
on
my
emphasis
in
the
reports,
I
could
almost
totally
control
how
my
classmates
understood
my
particular
topic.
This
was
the
beginning
of
my
experience
of
writing
as
a
medium
which
would
require
both
research
and
an
ability
to
use
that
research
and
present
it
in
an
effective
way.
In
the
seventh
and
eighth
grades
I
wrote
several
small
research
papers,
as
none
exceeded
the
length
of
three
or
four
pages.
I
had
not
yet
encountered
the
idea
of
a
thesis,
but
I
was
nonetheless
forced
to
make
several
arguments
to
make
my
papers
all
the
more
convincing.
At
this
point,
I
also
began
to
take
an
interest
in
current
events.
I
eventually
found
the
editorial
pages
and
people
like
George
Will
and
Robert
Novak.
While
I
almost
never
understood
either
the
issues
they
were
discussing
or
the
arguments
they
made,
I
saw
how
effectively
writing
could
be
used
as
a
means
of
criticism.
This
idea
fascinated
me.
It
was
not
like
arguing,
which
I
had
always
associated
with
yelling
and
incivility.
Writing
was
suddenly
something
which
I
could
to
put
forth
my
ideas
and
constructively
attack
the
ideas
of
others.
I
went
to
High
School
with
this
understanding,
but
not
enough
confidence
or
ability
to
make
it
a
reality
for
myself.
What
made
the
situation
all
the
more
difficult
was
that
I
was
now
attending
a
private,
extremely
competitive
school,
where
I
found
myself
with
students
who
often
seemed
smarter
and
more
able
than
myself.
In
my
Western
Civilization
course,
I
often
found
myself
struggling
to
keep
up
with
the
material.
Mr.
Berk,
the
teacher,
took
an
interest
in
my
development,
and
challenged
me
to
improve
my
ability
to
write.
In
his
class
I
wrote
my
first
real
paper,
a
fifteen
page
research
paper
on
the
book
The
Last
of
the
Wine.
I
did
well,
and
this
greatly
improved
my
confidence
in
both
writing
and
in
classroom
exchanges.
Mr.
Berk
also
had
us
debate
often
in
class
about
relatively
simple
subjects.
For
example,
one
debate
was
about
whether
Russian
Czar
Peter
the
Great
could
truly
be
defined
as
Great
.
I
found
it
helpful
to
write
out
my
arguments
beforehand.
This
enabled
me
to
establish
both
a
logical
flow
to
my
thinking
and
get
a
greater
confidence
in
my
arguments,
which
would
enable
me
to
improvise
more
during
the
debate.
Students
were
defined
a
viewpoint,
so
they
were
forced
to
defend
it
whether
they
agreed
with
it
or
not.
This
greatly
improved
my
ability
to
formulate
comprehensive
arguments,
even
when
I
did
not
agree
with
what
I
was
saying.
Also,
on
his
exams
we
would
not
only
have
definitions
and
fill-in-the-blanks,
but
essays
as
well,
the
subject
of
which
would
be
unknown
before
the
exam.
This
changed
the
entire
scope
of
my
study
habits.
I
no
longer
simply
memorized
facts,
but
made
sure
I
understood
how
they
fit
into
the
big
picture
and
had
a
definite
grasp
of
their
usage
and
significance.
Suddenly,
writing
required
me
to
be
able
to
have
command
of
an
argument
at
a
moment's
notice.
This
represented
a
shift
in
my
relationship
with
writing.
Writing
became
a
much
more
interactive
process.
I
could
no
longer
get
by
by
simply
reciting
what
I
had
done
on
my
summer
vacation.
Writing
required
critical
thought
and
often
exhaustive
research
of
a
particular
subject.
I
felt
that
then,
more
than
any
time
in
my
academic
career,
I
really
had
to
work
to
be
successful.
It
was
not
a
problem;
I
enjoyed
writing
and
found
that
I
was
getting
increasingly
better
at
it.
But
this
simply
illustrates
how
much
writing
had
changed
for
me
as
a
student.
I
have
never
been
pushed
as
hard
academically
and
intellectually
as
I
was
junior
year
of
high
school
in
A.P.
U.S.
History
by
my
teacher,
Mr.
Sanborn.
More
than
anyone
else
I
had
before
or
since,
he
showed
me
how
to
truly
write
effectively.
He
asked
that
we
knew
the
facts,
but
never
required
us
to
recite
them
on
any
test.
Rather,
we
were
forced
to
take
stances
on
various
historical
issues
and
events
and
defend
them
concisely
and
conclusively.
History
was
no
longer
a
collection
of
dates,
but
theories,
events,
and
issues
that
were
intertwined
in
various
ways.
He
required
us
to
find
out
how
wand
why
these
were
intertwined,
and
defend
our
views.
This
process
took
place
through
term
papers,
debates,
and
exams.
Because
of
the
heavy
amount
of
reading
in
this
class
and
the
writing
that
always
followed
it,
I
gained
a
great
deal
of
poise
and
confidence
in
my
ability
to
write
effectively
and
think
critically.
This
extended
to
all
of
my
other
classes,
where
writing
research
and
argument
papers
was
now
a
common
practice.
More
and
more,
I
found
that
I
was
a
strong
writer,
especially
compared
with
the
other
students
in
my
classes.
My
junior
year
confirmed
the
fact
that
writing
was
now
a
major
part
of
school,
and
that
I
was
able
to
write
effectively
the
majority
of
the
time.
That
same
year
I
was
required
to
take
Creative
Writing
with
Mr.
Cole.
I
approached
the
coarse
skeptically,
as
I
knew
that
we
had
to
write
poems
and
short
stories.
This
is
not
something
I
looked
forward
to,
as
I
never
had
felt
that
writing
creatively
had
involved
such
things.
While
the
class
did
not
cause
me
to
become
a
poet
or
author,
it
did
greatly
improve
my
respect
for
and
understanding
of
the
writing
process.
After
a
period
of
freewriting,
we
wrote
several
pieces,
and
then
discussed
and
critiqued
both
our
poems
and
stories
and
those
of
others
in
the
class.
This
greatly
improved
my
ability
to
think
critically,
as
I
found
this
was
much
easier
when
one
was
dealing
with
a
work
that
was
not
theirs.
Freewriting
was
also
introduced
as
an
effective
method
of
writing
creatively,
as
it
was
something
of
an
association
game.
We
would
often
begin
with
words
or
broad
subjects,
then
expand
on
them,
until
finally
we
would
have
a
finished
piece.
This
showed
me
that
writing
was
a
process
to
be
attacked
form
the
inside
out:
start
with
your
basic
themes
and
issues,
then
gradually
expand
on
them.
The
class
discussions
were
almost
always
constructive,
and
all
of
the
students
discovered
that
critiquing
and
rewriting
were
indispensable
parts
of
the
writing
process.
Creative
writing
greatly
affected
my
habits
as
a
writer:
I
feel
very
uneasy
if
anything
I
turn
in
has
not
been
fully
reread
and
rewritten
at
least
two
or
three
times.
As
a
result,
I
take
much
more
pride
in
my
writing,
and
this
pride
has
translated
into
greater
confidence
as
a
writer.
Senior
year
I
took
a
course
called
Writing
Criticism
.
The
course
was
structured
very
loosely,
as
we
would
read
plays,
watch
movies,
or
read
articles,
and
then
thoroughly
explore
our
problems
and
criticisms
of
them.
This
class
was
important
in
my
learning
that
criticism
is
not
necessarily
a
negative
enterprise,
as
long
as
comments
are
made
which
suggest
how
to
improve
the
subject
matter.
The
teacher
was
insistent
that
we
not
tear
down
other
people's
work,
but
make
suggestions
on
how
to
improve
it.
This
helped
my
understanding
of
various
mediums,
and
improved
my
ability
to
discuss
both
their
faults
and
strong
points.
We
were
also
required
to
keep
journals
in
this
and
other
classes,
which
recorded
our
thoughts
and
devlopment
on
the
various
types
of
assignments
we
had.
He
asked
for
them
only
once,
and
then
gave
them
back.
I
discovered
that
it
was
easy
to
learn
more
about
your
writing
style
and
process
if
you
scrutinized
it
closely,
a
journals
enabled
us
to
do
this.
During
my
senior
year
my
old
Western
Civ.
teacher,
Mr.
Berk,
said
in
his
Vietnam
class
that
one
of
my
research
papers
showed
that
I
was
a
true
leader
in
the
class.
Although
this
was
not
an
earth-shaking
moment,
it
was
nonetheless
my
proudest
moment
as
a
writer.
For
truly
the
first
time,
I
felt
that
my
abilities
were
not
only
being
represented
by
a
person
of
authority,
but
had
affected
him
so
much
as
to
comment
on
it
to
the
class.
Because
of
events
such
as
this,
I
felt
that
I
would
be
well
prepared
for
my
experiences
of
writing
in
college
at
Lafayette.
I
had
always
felt
that
I
was
well
prepared
for
college,
and
that
writing
here
would
be
an
extension
of
the
experiences
I
had
in
High
School.
For
the
most
part,
this
prediction
has
proven
to
be
true.
For
me,
that
I
was
a
confident
writer,
able
to
criticize
my
own
work,
meant
that
I
was
more
than
prepared
for
the
writing
that
a
fine
school
would
require
me
to
do.
For
the
most
part,
my
first
few
years
of
writing
at
Lafayette
has
done
little
to
challenge
the
expectations
and
notions
that
I
had
when
I
was
a
freshmen
three
years
ago.
Although
the
papers
have
gotten
longer,
the
workload
more
rigorous,
and
the
subject
matter
more
abstract,
I
was
prepared
for
this
progression.
I
feel
that
my
mind
was
developed
in
a
way
that
I
was
able
to
easily
deal
with
the
changes
in
the
writing
style
in
college.
One
ability
I
have
really
developed
during
my
time
at
Lafayette
is
to
be
able
to
synthesize
a
great
deal
of
complicated
material
and
manipulate
it
to
make
a
general
argument.
This
was
especially
tru
during
my
Europe:
1850-1917
class
which
I
took
my
second
year.
I
was
able
to
decide
what
was
important,
how
much
detail
to
use,
and
what
to
argue.
Thiss
was
a
very
demanding
class,
and
on
the
take-home
exams
I
was
able
to
use
my
skills
to
satisfying
results.
These
experiences
have
prepared
me
well
for
the
job
of
Writing
Associate.
I
have
enough
confidence
in
both
myself
as
a
writer
and
in
the
writing
process
to
be
an
outlet
for
the
creativity
of
others.
I
realize
that
some
first
year
students
will
not
be
as
prepared
as
I
was,
or
that
some
will
be
more
prepared.
But
my
job
will
stay
the
same
for
each:
to
help
them
gain
greater
confidence
in
themselves,
both
in
their
writing
and
their
ability
to
think
critically.
