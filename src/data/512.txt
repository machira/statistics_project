Literacy
Narrative
I
never
had
much
luck
with
education,
but
I
think
I've
finally
recovered
from
the
experiences
that
shaped
my
literacy
during
my
adolescent
years.
Prior
to
college
writing,
I
chose
to
ignore
the
profound
impact
that
a
few
wrong
turns
could
have
on
the
way
someone
things
about
literacy,
and
specifically
the
portion
of
literacy
concerned
with
academic
discourse.
It
was
a
long
road
to
recover
the
enjoyment
of
literacy
I
experienced
in
my
youth,
but
it
was
well
worth
it.
My
literacy
started
the
same
way
as
literacy
in
ancient
civilizations:
With
a
complex
oral
canon
drawn
from
the
writings
of
Thomas
Rhys,
Dr.
Seuss,
and
Brian
Jaques,
I
could
recite
prose
for
hours
at
a
relatives
request
during
Thanksgiving
or
Easter,
and
had
an
endless
appetite
for
stories.
I
developed
a
voice
full
of
confidence
in
my
own
stories,
along
with
complex
plots
that
fused
the
rhymes
of
Seuss
with
the
puzzles
of
Jacques.
All
that
remained
was
for
me
to
learn
how
to
read
and
write,
a
prospect
I
was
anticipating
with
great
excitement.
First
grade
changed
all
that.
NAlways
look
at
people
when
you're
talking
to
them.
It
lets
them
know
you're
not
scared.O
Dad
had
chanted
this
mantra
every
time
I
dared
mutter
in
response
to
an
adult's
question,
or
gaze
away
at
something
more
interesting.
The
words
on
the
page
were
hard
to
read.
The
book
used
words
I
had
not
seen
before,
and
they
were
very
close
together.
NDon't
stutter.O
The
teacher
remarked
NUse
your
finger
to
follow
the
words
when
you
read
aloud,
stop
staring
at
everyone.O
I
didn't
know
who
to
listen
to.
At
night,
I
memorized
the
student
reader
passages
for
the
next
day,
until
I
could
no
longer
keep
up
with
the
volume
of
reading.
NHe's
really
fallen
behind
the
rest
of
the
class,O
The
teacher
told
my
mother
one
afternoon.
NI
don't
think
he'll
ever
amount
to
anything.O
After
that,
they
brought
in
a
battery
of
psychologists,
and
eventually
determined
that
I
had
a
hand-eye
coordination
disability,
at
which
point
Mom
decided
she'd
had
enough
and
announced
that
we
were
going
to
homeschool
next
year.
I
missed
my
friends,
but
not
the
classroom,
because
the
concept
of
what
a
classroom
could
be
had
been
expanded
for
me,
to
include
all
sorts
of
new
possibilities.
Literacy
now
included
reading
comic
books
and
seeing
plays,
watching
movies,
and
traveling
to
historical
sites,
all
of
which
seemed
blessedly
removed
from
Dick
and
Jane.
It
wasn't
to
last
long.
Over
everything
we
did,
in
grade
school
and
in
high
school,
the
shadow
of
standardized
testing
and
college
admissions
loomed.
There
was
always
a
struggle
to
get
accommodations
for
my
disability,and
the
environment
around
me
stressed
science
so
strongly
(due
to
my
parent's
background,
as
well
as
the
general
culture)
that
all
other
forms
of
literacy
were
marginalized.
Finally,
the
pSAT,
which
held
such
tremendous
sway
over
college
admissions,
seemed
to
prove
what
I
had
previously
feared:
the
only
literacy
that
matters
is
the
kind
which
helps
you
to
pass
standardized
exams.
Two
terrible
community
college
professors
later,
I
was
all
but
convinced,
and
it
would
take
a
miracle
to
make
me
entertain
an
assertion
to
the
contrary.
That
miracle
was
peer
editing.
During
my
last
two
years
of
high-school,
I
became
involved
with
a
literary
magazine,
as
the
on
line
editor.
This
experience
re-awakened
my
love
for
literacy
and
writing,
as
I
interacted
with
the
other
staff
members,
three
of
which
had
been
Schoolastic"
short
story
and
poetry
finalists.
Through
discussion
and
innovation
in
my
own
writing,
and
interacting
with
theirs,
I
gained
a
new
vision
of
literacy
as
a
dialog,
rather
than
an
impregnable
wall
set
up
by
educators
and
the
culture
to
dictate
what
was
important.
I
started
to
write
for
my
own
enjoyment
again,
and
added
English
as
a
second
major
as
a
result
of
the
experience.
My
two
years
at
Lafayette
have
been
instrumental
in
fostering
this
re-awakening
of
my
love
for
literacy.
I
hope
that
my
experience
with
the
WA
program
will
allow
me
to
pass
on
the
joys
of
interaction
with
fellow
writers
as
other
students
explore
what
it
means
to
be
a
literate
member
of
the
student
body
at
Lafayette.
