My
Literary
Narrative

Writing,
like
any
other
art
form,
in
order
to
be
done
well,
must
be
practiced
and
improved
upon.
Just
as
dancers
spend
years
training
their
bodies
to
achieve
a
desired
form,
and
painters
their
brush
strokes
to
achieve
the
desired
effect,
so
too
must
writers
work
to
improve
their
communication
skills.
Every
writer,
experienced
or
veteran,
has
a
history,
a
story
about
their
personal
development
as
an
artist.
Many
experiences
in
my
history
as
a
writer
have
shaped
the
way
I
write
today.
It
took
me
a
long
time
and
much
practice
in
order
to
become
the
sort
of
writer
I
am
now.
My
teachers,
parents,
and
peers
took
time
to
teach
me
techniques,
thereby
helping
me
develop
my
skills
as
a
writer.
Everyone
develops
as
a
writer
differently,
and
has
different
styles
and
approaches
to
writing.
These
styles
are
a
product
of
each
writers
history,
how
that
writer
learned
the
art
of
writing.
My
first
memory
as
a
writer
was
when
I
was
in
first
grade.
My
class
learned
the
alphabet.
While
pronouncing
the
sounds
of
each
letter
proved
no
challenge,
writing
the
letters
was
difficult.
Often
I
would
write
letters
backward,
but
eventually,
after
much
practice,
I
was
able
to
overcome
this
difficulty
although
my
handwriting
was
atrocious.
While
my
report
card
showed
good
marks
in
many
subject,
the
column
for
the
penmanship
grade
always
left
more
to
be
desired.
Another
memory
I
have
as
a
young
writer
was
when
I
was
in
second
grade.
The
class
was
studying
whales
and
we
were
assigned
the
creative
writing
task
of
composing
a
poem
about
whales.
So,
my
poem
was
a
short,
cute,
rhyming
poem
that
eventually
was
published
in
a
district
wide
newsletter.
My
parents
of
course,
were
very
proud.
The
praise
that
I
received
from
my
parents
made
me
want
to
continue
writing.
Throughout
the
rest
of
my
elementary
school
experience,
I
learned
how
to
construct
complex
sentences,
learned
about
proper
punctuation,
and
learned
to
form
paragraphs.
From
this
point,
my
writing
improved
drastically.
By
the
time
elementary
school
was
over,
I
had
the
ability
to
write
rudimentary
essays.
In
middle
school,
I
learned
how
to
write
an
argument
style
paper.
The
purpose
of
the
assignment
was
to
persuade
the
reader
that
our
stance
on
the
argument
was
correct.
For
this
style,
we
used
the
5-paragraphs
essay
style.
The
first
paragraph
introduced
the
argument,
then
the
next
3
were
supporting
arguments,
and
the
final
paragraph
served
as
the
conclusion,
tying
everything
together.
This
format
was
used
in
every
kind
of
argument
style
paper
I
was
asked
to
write.
I
remember
once
a
week
we
had
an
in
class
assignment
of
writing
this
kind
of
persuasive
essay.
Since
the
class
had
to
do
these
assignments
so
often,
we
had
the
5-paragraph
format
ingrained
in
our
brains.
As
a
result
of
this,
I
had
difficulty
breaking
away
from
this
format
later
on
in
school.
Using
a
different
writing
style
proved
to
be
rather
confusing
because
I
was
so
used
to
writing
only
one
way.
This
was
the
same
year,
my
seventh
grade
year,
that
I
encountered
my
best
experience
as
a
writer.
The
assignment
was
to
interview
an
elderly
person
and
then
write
about
his
or
her
life.
So,
the
person
I
chose
was
my
grandmother.
She
has
had
a
very
interesting
life;
living
through
two
world
wars
and
moving
to
America.
Two
students
from
my
class
were
chosen
to
read
in
front
of
half
of
my
entire
seventh
grade
class,
and
I
was
one
of
them.
I
had
to
stand
in
the
front
of
the
room
at
a
podium
and
read
aloud
to
the
audience.
When
I
was
done
reading
my
paper,
I
looked
at
my
teacher,
and
he
had
tears
in
his
eyes.
It
was
obvious
that
he
was
very
touched
by
my
portrayal
of
my
grandmother's
life.
This
was
my
best
writing
experience
because
it
was
then
that
I
realized
that
writing
can
be
very
powerful.
This
form
of
art
has
the
ability
to
have
a
dramatic
affect
on
people.
I
was
extremely
proud
that
something
I
had
written
had
such
a
profound
affect
on
someone.
When
I
entered
high
school,
my
writing
definitely
started
to
change
drastically.
Now,
instead
of
only
using
the
5-paragraph
essay
format,
I
started
to
branch
out
and
incorporate
more
length
and
style
into
my
writing.
However,
I
still
used
the
5-paragraph
format
as
the
backbone
of
my
writing.
During
this
time,
the
majority
of
my
writing
was
about
literature.
Most
assignments
asked
me
to
try
to
recognize
literary
devices
such
as
theme,
characterization,
setting,
etc.
Being
somewhat
limited,
my
papers
only
touched
upon
one
aspect
of
the
assigned
piece
of
literature.
Although
this
format
does
not
allow
the
adequate
development
of
ideas
required
to
write
a
sophisticated
paper,
it
did
get
me
started
thinking
that
papers
should
be
organized,
rather
than
just
a
jumble
of
thoughts.
As
I
progressed
further
in
high
school,
so
did
my
ability
to
write.
I
learned
to
recognize
how
various
aspects
of
literature
can
work
together
to
form
the
overall
theme
of
the
work.
By
incorporating
these
various
elements,
I
was
able
to
put
together
a
more
sophisticated
paper.
The
key
was
good
organization.
In
order
to
achieve
this,
I
started
making
outlines
and
then
writing
my
paper
by
following
the
outline.
In
fact,
it
was
not
my
English
teacher,
rather
it
was
my
biology
teacher
who
provided
his
students
with
a
worksheet
that
helped
the
students
put
together
a
comprehensive
outline.
Now,
with
an
outline,
writing
the
paper
was
so
much
easier.
The
outline
aided
in
the
writing
because
I
had
all
the
points
I
wanted
to
make
down
on
paper
and
I
did
not
have
to
do
the
organization
work
in
my
head,
but
rather
it
was
all
written
down
in
front
of
me.
This
organization
was
so
important
because
it
kept
me
from
jumping
from
idea
to
idea.
I
was
now
able
to
write
a
few
paragraphs
pertaining
to
one
idea,
and
when
finished
I
could
then
move
on
to
develop
the
next
idea.
Starting
out
with
an
outline
and
following
it
was
key
to
my
development
as
a
writer.
I
still
use
this
technique
in
my
writing
today
because
it
helps
to
keep
everything
organized
and
it
assures
me
that
I
wont
leave
any
points
out
of
my
paper
that
should
be
included.
By
writing
it
out
first,
and
then
using
a
computer
to
compose
the
paper,
I
find
the
writing
process
much
easier.
I
am
a
big
fan
of
the
outline
technique
and
would
recommend
it
to
any
writer,
veteran
or
beginner.
In
fact,
I
made
an
outline
to
write
this
paper!
My
senior
year
in
high
school,
I
was
enrolled
in
an
AP
English
class.
This
class
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
truly
refine
my
writing.
In
this
class,
I
read
complex
novels
and
wrote
many,
many
papers.
For
each
paper
we
wrote,
we
met
one
on
one
with
our
teacher
to
go
over
various
mistakes
that
were
made.
We
then
had
the
opportunity
to
revise
our
papers
and
submit
them
a
second
time
to
our
teacher.
Through
this
process
of
writing
and
revision,
I
truly
developed
into
a
better
writer.
It
did
not
happen
overnight,
but
it
did
happen.
I
truly
believe
that
only
through
various
revisions
can
writing
improve.
Papers
are
not
perfect
the
first
time,
and
often,
if
not
always,
need
revision.
I
feel
my
high
school
experience
adequately
prepared
me
for
college
level
writing.
My
high
school
experiences
truly
prepared
me.
College
writing
for
me,
proved
to
be
more
challenging
than
high
school
writing,
a
challenge
I
had
to
get
used
to,
but
it
did
not
seem
unbearable.
That's
how
I
felt
about
all
of
my
classes,
not
just
writing
courses.
I
felt
that
it
was
harder,
yet
I
was
ready
for
the
challenge.
It
was
also
a
big
help
to
have
likeable
professors
and
peers
that
were
willing
to
help
me
overcome
the
challenges
of
the
first
year.
In
college,
I
have
had
to
write
many
research
papers.
My
freshman
year,
the
papers
were
less
opinionated
than
they
are
now,
meaning
I
put
less
of
my
own
personal
interpretation
into
my
work.
It
took
me
some
time
to
learn
how
to
write
a
good
research
paper.
I
used
to
do
the
research,
and
then
merely
present
the
facts.
However,
I
soon
learned
that
I
could
use
those
facts
to
form
my
own
opinion
or
interpretation
of
the
material.
This
interpretation
was
just
as
or
more
important
than
the
actual
research
and
formed
the
bulk
of
my
papers.
Before
I
learned
to
do
this
however,
my
writing
was
in
"book-report"
format,
something
my
professors
did
not
want.
In
my
German
classes
at
Lafayette,
I
am
asked
to
write
papers
in
German.
This
is
rather
difficult,
but
even
though
I
write
in
a
different
language,
my
style
remains
the
same.
I
still
have
to
interpret
literature
and
present
a
coherent,
organized
essay.
Even
at
the
college
level,
writing
can
be
rather
ambiguous,
and
I
feel
that
many
students
share
my
opinon.
After
all,
there
are
so
many
rules
of
grammar,
as
well
as
so
many
styles
of
writing.
Also,
different
professors
expect
different
things
from
assignments.
It
is
very
easy
to
become
quite
confused
when
one
writes,
especially
at
the
college
level.
For
example,
I
wrote
a
paper
for
a
history
professor
that
received
a
grade
of
A.
However,
I
assume
that
if
I
had
handed
that
same
paper
to
another
one
of
my
professors,
who
I
know
to
be
more
critical,
the
grade
would
have
been
lower.
So,
obviously
these
two
professors
have
different
views
of
what
qualifies
as
a
good
paper.
Therefore,
sometimes
it
is
very
difficult
for
the
student
to
know
what
is
good
and
what
is
bad
about
their
writing.
I
always
appreciate
it
when
my
professors
tell
me
exactly
what
they
liked
and
disliked
about
each
of
my
writing
assignments.
This
allows
for
improvement
the
next
time
I
write.
Sometimes
it
becomes
very
confusing
when
professors
have
differing
opinions
about
writing.
Although
writing
can
be
confusing,
I
still
enjoy
it
very
much.
One
of
the
reasons
I
like
it
so
much
is
because
it
is
not
like
a
math
problem,
for
example.
There
is
not
one
right
or
wrong
answer.
Also,
there
is
not
one
way
to
write;
everybody
has
a
different
style
or
approach.
When
you
write,
you
don't
have
to
be
right,
but
as
long
as
you
can
communicate
clearly
and
support
your
conclusions,
you
are
successful.
Now
that
I
am
in
college,
I
have
found
that
I
like
using
a
computer
to
write
because
it
is
faster
than
using
a
pen
and
paper
and
I
can
use
spell-check.
However,
before
I
am
satisfied
with
the
final
version
of
any
writing
that
I
do,
I
have
to
proofread
my
paper
for
any
errors
or
awkward
sentences.
For
this,
I
like
to
print
out
a
hard
copy
of
the
paper
so
that
I
can
see
what
it
looks
like
in
front
of
me.
Sometimes
I
find
it
difficult
to
proofread
while
it
is
still
on
the
computer
screen.
My
attitude
about
and
impression
of
writers
has
changed
over
the
summer.
This
summer,
I
work
as
an
intern
at
a
publishing
company.
I
have
the
opportunity
to
read
various
manuscripts
that
are
sent
in
for
review
by
our
editors.
Some
manuscripts
and
book
proposals
are
very
good
and
some
are
terrible.
Working
here
has
shown
me
that
often
even
the
most
experienced
writers
are
not
perfect.
For
example,
one
of
our
authors
who
just
finished
putting
together
a
book
for
us
is
also
an
editor
of
a
magazine.
She
was
responsible
for
writing
the
preface
and
introduction
to
this
particular
book.
This
woman
is
supposed
to
be
a
professional
writer,
but
her
work
was
poor.
Her
writing
was
filled
with
grammatical
errors
and
the
topic
she
chose
was
not
relevant
to
the
rest
of
the
book.
As
a
result,
this
part
of
the
book
had
to
be
re-written.
This
proved
to
me
that
even
the
best
writers
need
people
to
review
and
edit
their
writing.
I
have
also
received
various
manuscripts
from
professors,
people
I
would
consider
excellent
writers,
but
often
times
their
writing
needs
improvement.
So,
my
attitude
toward
writing
certainly
changed.
Now
I
realize
that
every
writer
must
go
through
a
series
of
revisions.
Throughout
my
career
as
a
writer,
my
feelings
about
my
writing
have
changed.
Just
starting
as
a
writer,
I
was
not
very
confident
of
my
ability.
I
needed
practice
and
reassurance
in
order
to
build
confidence.
Now,
I
feel
that
my
writing
has
reached
a
new,
more
sophisticated
level,
and
consequently
I
feel
more
confident
about
the
things
I
say
in
my
writing
and
about
the
way
I
write
in
general.
Having
confidence
is
extremely
important.
One
of
my
professors
at
Lafayette
commented
on
my
confident
writing
style.
I
feel
that
if
you
are
going
to
say
or
write
something,
it
should
be
done
with
assurance.
As
I
perceive
my
writing
in
the
future,
I
see
it
growing
and
developing
even
further
than
it
has
already.
By
the
time
I
graduate
from
Lafayette
College,
I
hope
to
be
an
even
better
writer
than
I
am
now.
The
process
of
growing
as
a
writer
never
stops;
everyone
has
the
ability
to
improve.
My
history
as
a
writer
has
certainly
been
one
in
which
I
have
improved
significantly
through
practice.
