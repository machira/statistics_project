Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative
As
I
headed
to
Turning
Stone
Casino
with
my
VAST
class
one
Saturday
morning
last
semester,
it
was
clear
to
me
that
my
concerns
were
different
than
those
of
the
rest
of
my
classmates.
The
bus
was
abuzz
with
the
thoughts
of
poker,
black
jack,
roulette,
slot
machines,
and
craps.
People
were
excited
about
the
prospect
of
winning
money,
worried
about
the
prospect
of
losing
it.
I,
on
the
other
hand,
spent
the
four-hour
bus
ride
thinking
about
something
entirely
different:
the
two
ten-page
papers
I
had
due
on
Monday,
neither
of
which
I
had
started
yet.
A
daunting
situation
on
its
own,
matters
were
made
worse
by
the
fact
that
I
would
not
be
on
campus
for
most
of
the
weekend.
My
VAST
class
left
for
Turning
Stone
at
eight
in
the
morning
on
Saturday,
not
to
return
until
eleven
at
night,
and
I
had
an
important
event
for
Best
Buddies,
an
organization
I
volunteer
for,
from
10
am
to
7
pm
on
Sunday.
That
left
a
distressingly
small
amount
of
time
to
write
my
two
papers.
There
was
no
time
to
engage
in
my
usual
writing
process.
Typically,
I
start
by
brainstorming
possible
topics
for
my
paper.
After
using
a
combination
of
process
of
elimination
and
eeny
meeny
miny
mo
to
select
my
topic,
I
begin
my
research,
carefully
underlining
or
highlighting
everything
that
might
be
useful
to
my
paper.
I
then
brainstorm,
the
specific
ideas
I
would
like
to
express
in
my
paper,
afterwards
writing
an
extremely
detailed
outline.
I
then
write
my
paper,
deviating
from
my
outline
only
if
I
think
of
a
better
way
to
organize
my
thoughts.
After
completing
my
paper,
I
go
through
a
series
of
several
edits,
focusing
on
organization,
sentence
structure,
the
requirements
of
the
assignment,
and
a
host
of
other
concerns.
This
weekend,
however,
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
me
to
go
through
my
entire
writing
process.
I
did
not
have
the
time
to
brainstorm,
research,
brainstorm,
outline,
write,
edit,
edit,
editE
To
get
these
papers
done,
I
had
to
seriously
condense
my
typical
writing
process.
Thankfully,
over
the
past
year,
I
had
learned
how
to
alter
my
writing
process
without
drastically
sacrificing
the
quality
of
my
work.
I
have
learned
that
conceptualizing
writing
as
a
process
is
essential
to
good
writing;
the
specific
processes
a
writer
uses,
however,
are
irrelevant.
Before
last
year,
I
was
set
in
my
ways
as
a
writer;
I
wrote
academic
essays
and
used
an
identical
process
each
time
I
wrote.
Over
the
past
year,
however,
I
have
learned
both
to
alter
my
writing
process
depending
on
circumstance
(as
demonstrated
by
my
casino
and
Best
Buddies
weekend),
and
to
write
for
a
number
of
different
purposes.
Although
I
was
able
to
write
papers
in
the
past,
I
believe
that
over
the
past
year,
I
have
become
more
of
a
writer,
able
to
write
under
varying
circumstances,
for
varying
purposes,
and
in
varying
formats.
Although
my
past
progress
as
a
writer
has
been
precipitated
principally
through
my
work
at
school,
it
is
through
writing
I
have
done
outside
of
school
and
my
work
as
a
WA
that
I
have
grown
as
a
writer
over
the
past
year.
Up
until
last
winter,
my
writing
had
been
almost
exclusively
for
school.
With
the
exception
of
writing
short
stories
and
poems
for
fun
when
I
was
in
elementary
school,
I
had
never
done
any
substantial
writing
that
was
not
intended
to
be
read
and
graded
by
a
teacher.
As
a
result,
I
have
become
adept
at
academic
writing:
centering
my
thoughts
around
a
single,
strong
thesis
statement,
fully
supporting
all
of
my
statements,
and
wrapping
up
my
paper
with
a
strong
conclusion.
Although
writing
for
school
had
given
me
the
basic
skills
to
do
more
with
my
writing,
I
had
never
before
had
the
opportunity
to
utilize
those
skills
in
a
non-academic
context.
This
year,
however,
I
have
had
two
such
opportunities:
writing
cover
letters
for
applications
for
summer
internships,
and
writing
articles
for
my
summer
internship
at
a
newspaper.
These
experiences
enabled
me
to
learn
how
to
write
for
different
purposes
and
for
different
audiences
than
I
am
used
to,
and,
as
a
result,
to
become
a
much
better
and
well-rounded
writer.
This
winter,
as
I
began
writing
cover
letters
for
my
summer
internship
applications,
I
realized
that,
for
the
first
time
ever,
what
I
wrote
was
going
to
have
a
real-world
relevance.
My
cover
letter
would
affect
my
chances
of
getting
an
internship,
not
just
my
chances
of
getting
an
A.
It
was
paramount,
therefore,
that
my
cover
letter
be
well
written
and
effective.
This
made
me
realize
more
than
ever
that
developing
good
writing
skills
is
not
just
about
getting
better
grades
in
school;
it
can
have
very
real
and
significant
effects
in
the
outside
world.
As
a
result,
I
have
begun
to
take
my
writing
even
more
seriously
in
school,
trying
even
harder
to
improve
my
writing.
Although
no
particular
paper
I
write
in
school
will
help
me
get
an
internship
or,
someday,
a
job,
learning
how
to
write
well
will.
In
WA
training
last
year,
we
learned
to
NWA
the
writer,
not
the
paper.O
Finally
seeing
the
great
significance
of
being
able
to
write
well,
I
now
more
fully
understand
the
rationale
behind
this
credo.
In
addition,
writing
cover
letters
was
a
very
different
type
of
writing
than
I
had
ever
done
before.
It
had
a
different
format,
a
different
purpose,
and
a
different
audience.
Instead
of
writing
a
standard
academic
essay,
I
had
to
write
a
business
letter.
Instead
of
writing
in
order
to
impress
a
teacher
with
my
writing
style,
complex
ideas,
and
mastery
of
subject
material,
I
had
to
write
in
order
to
display
my
qualifications
and
competence
as
a
potential
employee.
And
instead
of
writing
for
a
teacher,
who
would
read
my
writing
to
see
where
he/she
could
help
me
improve
and
learn,
I
had
to
write
for
a
potential
employer
who
would
read
it
in
order
to
judge
me
against
others
who
were
vying
for
the
same
position.
Although
my
cover
letters
were
somewhat
weak
at
first,
as
I
wrote
more,
they
became
stronger
and
were
easier
to
write.
Writing
in
this
new
style,
therefore,
helped
me
develop
my
skills
as
a
writer,
extending
the
purposes
and
audiences
for
which
I
can
write.
For
the
summer
internship
I
ultimately
acquired,
I
was
charged
with
writing
articles
for
a
local
newspaper.
Like
writing
cover
letters,
this
experience
highlighted
the
real
world
relevance
of
being
able
to
write
well.
For
my
internship,
however,
writing
well
was
not
my
only
concern.
In
school,
the
only
audience
for
most
of
my
writing
is
the
teacher.
When
writing
articles,
however,
I
had
two
audiences.
I
had
to
balance
the
interests
of
the
newspaper
(ensuring
that
articles
were
interesting
enough
to
grab
readersO
attention)
and
to
the
readers
(ensuring
that
articles
were
accurate,
truthful
and
not
exaggerated).
Writing
newspaper
articles,
therefore,
like
writing
cover
letters,
has
provided
me
the
opportunity
to
apply
the
skills
that
I
have
learned
thus
far
in
an
academic
setting,
to
different
forms
of
writing,
new
audiences
and
different
purposes,
thereby
broadening
me
as
a
writer
and
expanding
my
writing
capabilities.
In
addition
to
writing
cover
letters
and
writing
articles
for
my
internship,
working
as
a
WA
has
also
played
a
major
role
in
my
development
as
a
writer
over
the
past
year.
As
a
WA,
I
quickly
learned
that
helping
others
with
their
writing
could
help
me
a
great
deal
with
my
own.
Among
other
things,
being
a
WA
helped
me
recognize
more
than
ever
the
importance
of
the
writing
process,
helped
focus
my
attention
on
higher
order
concerns,
and
helped
me
realize
the
great
benefits
of
peer
review.
Although
I
have
long
viewed
writing
as
a
process,
utilizing
various
stages
of
pre-writing,
writing,
and
revising,
being
a
WA
has
allowed
me
to
realize
just
how
important
doing
so
truly
is.
As
a
WA,
I
could
see
a
major
difference
between
student
writers
who
had
outlined
their
papers
before
writing
them
and
those
who
had
not
done
so,
as
well
as
between
student
writers
who
had
brought
me
a
first
draft
of
their
work
and
those
who
had
brought
me
a
revised
copy.
In
addition,
the
class
I
worked
with
during
Spring
Semester
rarely
brought
completed
drafts
to
their
conferences.
As
a
result,
I
often
held
my
conferences
after
having
read
only
a
topic,
some
brainstormed
ideas,
or
a
short
outline.
Nevertheless,
after
some
practice,
I
found
that
these
were
sometimes
some
of
my
most
productive
conferences.
In
addition,
there
were
several
students
who
were
very
strong
writers
and
often
brought
polished
papers
to
their
conferences.
While
it
was
also
difficult
to
hold
these
types
of
conferences
at
first,
these
too
gradually
became
easier.
Working
as
a
WA,
therefore,
emphasized
for
me
that
writing
is
a
truly
dynamic
process.
It
revealed
that
important
work
can
be
done
at
each
stage
of
the
writing
process,
and
that
writing
can
always
be
improved,
altered,
or
at
least
reconsidered.
In
addition,
I
saw
how
many
different
writing
processes
the
student
writers
I
worked
with
had.
This
encouraged
me
to
experiment
and
become
more
flexible
with
my
own
writing
process.
If
working
as
a
WA
had
not
taught
me
to
do
so,
I
would
never
have
been
able
to
survive
my
Turning
Stone/Best
Buddies
weekend.
Working
as
a
WA
also
redirected
my
attention
to
higher
order
concerns.
In
general,
I
am
a
very
detailed
oriented
individual.
When
revising
my
writing,
therefore,
I
have
a
tendency
to
focus
on
details,
such
as
grammar,
spelling,
and
sentence
structure.
In
WA
training,
however,
I
was
taught
to
focus
on
concerns
like
organization,
audience,
and
style.
Learning
to
do
this
in
WA
conferences
helped
me
to
focus
on
these
things
more
when
revising
my
own
writing.
Focusing
on
such
concerns,
I
believe,
has
greatly
improved
my
writing.
One
final
way
being
a
WA
has
helped
me
develop
as
a
writer
is
by
helping
me
rediscover
how
beneficial
peer
review
can
be.
Throughout
high
school,
I
had
my
mother
look
over
nearly
every
paper
I
handed
in
for
school.
Once
I
entered
college,
however,
I
thought
that
the
independence
I
could
now
exercise
in
other
areas
of
my
life
should
extend
to
my
writing.
I
believed
that
I
should
be
able
to
write
good
papers
and
earn
good
grades
without
having
to
seek
help
from
others.
I
did
not
realize,
however,
that
just
because
someone
is
capable
of
writing
a
paper
well
by
themselves
does
not
mean
that
another
personOs
assistance
would
not
make
the
paper
even
better.
Working
as
a
WA
made
me
realize
that
having
another
person
work
with
you
to
improve
or
develop
a
piece
of
writing
in
no
way
implies
that
the
writer
is
in
any
way
less
competent.
As
a
result
of
this
revelation,
I
have
become
substantially
more
open
to
seeking
other
peopleOs
ideas
and
having
others
help
me
with
my
writing.
In
addition,
it
prepared
me
for
my
summer
internship,
where
I
was
able
to
take
the
comments
my
editor
made
about
my
articles
and
the
changes
he
made
to
them
constructively,
rather
than
as
a
personal
attack.
Based
on
the
course
my
literacy
narrative
has
taken
over
the
past
year,
I
feel
that
the
most
important
advice
I
could
give
to
new
WAOs
is
to
strive
to
learn
how
to
become
better
ones.
My
entire
literacy
narrative
is
a
paper
detailing
how
the
experiences
I
have
had
over
the
past
year
have
helped
me
grow
as
a
writer.
Writing
cover
letters
and
newspaper
articles,
for
example,
has
helped
me
learn
to
write
for
different
purposes
and
audiences
than
I
am
used
to.
Working
as
a
WA
has
helped
me
realize
the
great
importance
of
the
writing
process,
has
helped
me
focus
on
higher
order
concerns
in
my
writing,
and
has
reminded
me
of
the
value
of
peer
review.
Despite
the
fact
that
I
have
been
writing
for
over
a
decade,
I
still
had
a
great
deal
of
room
to
develop
over
the
past
year.
Just
as
it
takes
time
to
develop
into
a
good
writer,
it
also
takes
time
to
develop
into
a
good
WA.
At
orientation,
new
WAOs
are
given
lots
of
advice,
tips,
and
scenarios
depicting
the
ideal
WA
conference.
It
is
unreasonable,
however,
to
expect
yourself
to
be
the
ideal
WA
at
first.
There
is
a
lot
involved
in
being
a
WA,
and
you
canOt
expect
yourself
to
do
it
all
at
once.
When
I
first
became
a
WA,
I
knew
from
the
beginning
how
I
wanted
to
approach
my
WA
conferences.
Still,
it
took
a
long
time
for
me
to
begin
to
feel
comfortable
approaching
conferences
as
an
equal,
to
make
fewer
notes
on
drafts
before
my
conferences,
and
to
focus
more
on
higher
order
concerns.
The
most
important
advice
I
would
offer
to
new
WAOs,
therefore,
is
to
be
open
to
learning
as
you
go
along,
and
to
constantly
try
new
things
in
your
conferences,
always
trying
to
improve
yourself.
The
CWP
emphasizes
to
its
WAOs
that
writing
is
a
process.
WA's
can
benefit
greatly
from
realizing
that
the
same
applies
to
becoming
an
effective
WA.
