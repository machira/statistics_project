I'm
Not
Like
Them...
But
I
Can
Pretend!
Dearest
reader,
I'm
trying
to
sound
like
a
twentieth
century
writer,
writing
a
letter
to
you,
and
I
can
only
assume
my
confession
has
already
paradoxically
hindered
my
purpose.
I
started
writing
the
novel
again
this
afternoon
--
called
Songs
About
The
Way
Things
Are
--
but
instead
of
literally
continuing,
I
went
back
and
made
some
minor
cuts
to
the
first
chapter.
I
noticed
there
were
some
spots
where
I
clearly
sounded
too
vague;
without
insider
knowledge
on
my
life,
one
would
think
I
was
babbling
or
just
not
making
any
sense.
The
last
few
sentences
about
heaven,
hell,
hope,
alliteration,
and
Beanie
Babies
are
all
deleted
now,
and
for
good
I
think.
I
just
couldn't
live
with
myself.
Anyway,
the
second
chapter
is
going
to
revolve
around
a
bit
of
an
experimental
anti-Caulfield
attitude,
and
part
of
the
fun
will
be
to
figure
out
exactly
what
that
means,
and
then
write
about
it.
You'll
see.
I
promised
to
be
original
and
I
promised
myself
I
wouldn't
cry,
and
here
I
go
already.
Darn.
Oh
well.
I'm
going
to
do
this,
and
when
I
am
dead
and
buried,
our
little
letter
here
will
follow
up
my
text
in
a
Norton
Critical
edition,
reading
at
the
top,
"Letter
to
Anonymous
Reader."
My
dream
will
come
true.
And
the
footnote
to
the
letter
will
be
all
about
you!
I
just
realized
that
you
wanted
me
to
answer
the
questions
you
sent
in
a
type
of
chronological
order.
Actually,
it
has
been
on
my
mind
since
I
began
this.
I
have
allowed
it
to
torment
me
until
finally
I
must
mention
it.
I
don't
mean
to
digress
--I
suppose
I've
done
so
already
--
oh
well,
it's
just
that
there
is
always
more
to
say
than
what
I
can
get
down
even
while
typing
as
fast
as
I
can,
and
then
it
ends
up
all
wrong
regardless
of
the
care
I
take.
Then
I
revise,
never
making
real
progress
--
only
arbitrary
progress.
And
even
my
explanation
makes
little
sense
unless
you're
overly
agreeable.
But
that's
the
way
I
write
when
I
get
brave...maybe
someday
it
will
be
worth
something.
Note
to
editors:
if
there
are
any
split-infinitives,
they
stay,
or
there's
no
deal.
I
am
as
proud
of
imperfection
as
I
am
worried
about
possibly
(actually)
achieving
perfection.
So
for
my
sake,
criticize
me
for
now,
then
throw
me
in
the
gutter
like
you
all
did
to
Poe,
and
after
I
am
gone,
let
me
have
my
best-selling
anthology
resting
up
against
my
tombstone,
along
with
the
cheap
flowers
and
the
halfhearted
apology
notes.
I'm
sorry.
Okay.
I
started
writing
before
I
got
to
Kindergarten...I'm
sure
of
it.
I
remember
my
parents
took
me
out
of
preschool
before
Christmas
because
I
gave
this
kid
Skylar
a
black
eye
after
he
made
fun
of
me
for
having
my
crayons
set
up
by
color
and
in
rows
on
my
preschool
desk.
Now
he's
taking
care
of
his
frail
grandmother
and
repairing
windows
for
a
living,
and
here
I
am
at
college
thinking
back
to
how
I
would
always
amend
my
crayon
pictures
with
silly
captions.
I
am
ashamed
of
this.
One
my
mom
still
keeps
on
the
refrigerator
back
home
has
a
picture
of
a
big
smiling
face
colored
in
red
and
green,
and
the
caption
says
in
brown,
"I'm
Fat
Albert.
Hey
man!"
--Even
though
it
looks
nothing
like
the
actual
Fat
Albert
himself.
But
what
am
I
talking
about?
What
I
wanted
to
say
was
that
the
day
my
sister
(who
is
fourteen
months
older
than
me
and
two
grades
above
me)
first
went
to
Kindergarten,
my
parents
had
to
pull
me
away
from
her
while
I
cried.
She
was
and
still
is
my
best
friend.
I
couldn't
stand
to
see
her
go
to
school
before
me,
but
I
did,
and
when
she
came
home
with
little
"work
things"
to
do
I'd
do
them
with
her.
I
knew
my
alphabet
and
I
could
write
five-year-old
"stuff'
when
I
was
going
on
four,
I
believe.
This
is
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
my
earliest
memory
revolves
around
sitting
on
the
linoleum
floor
of
my
kitchen
(while
my
mom
was
cooking)
and
proclaiming
to
the
world,
"I
want
to
be
two
years
old
forever!"
Even
though
I
said
that,
and
even
though
the
memory
of
me
saying
that
haunts
my
concept
of
my
own
sophistication
to
this
very
day,
I
still
constantly
strive
to
think
and
act
on
par
with
the
advanced
level
of
my
sister.
But
she's
probably
in
her
Biology
lab
as
I
write
these
words,
doing
things
with
the
electron
microscope
I'll
never
want
to
even
know
how
to
do,
while
I
sit
here
worrying
about
whether
or
not
I
used
the
correct
tenses
in
the
few
sentences
preceding
this
one.
You
see,
I
cannot
go
on
in
writing
unless
I
am
sure
of
myself,
and
for
this
reason
I
avoid
writing
traditional
"drafts"
of
things.
For
example,
I
didn't
even
start
this
paragraph
until
I
knew
every
last
word
of
the
introduction
was
to
my
liking.
I'll
not
go
back
and
change
something
unless
instructed
to,
and
I
feel
justified
in
this
unorthodox
method
because
of
the
good
time
I
spend
in
my
slow
progress
from
paragraph
to
paragraph.
This
is
"just
me,"
however,
and
I
do
know
that
I
can,
if
necessary,
detach
myself
from
my
own
self-conscious,
J.
Alfred
Prufrock-esque
style;
that
is,
if
his
lifestyle
were
considered
in
the
context
of
merely
writing
and
not
the
entire
scope
of
life
(if
that
was
not
vague
and
twentieth
century-sounding,
then
I
must
have
failed
somewhere).
The
sad
thing
is,
I
never
had
to
worry
too
much
about
things
like
this
until
I
got
to
high
school,
because
for
almost
every
writing
setting
before
that,
from
Kindergarten
until
the
end
of
middle
school,
we
were
explicitly
told
what
to
write.
Instead
of
having
the
near
"literary
freedom"
that
I
can
now
almost
safely
assume
as
a
college
student
(don't
worry
--
I'm
worrying
already
about
your
reception
of
this),
we
had
strict
guidelines
to
follow.
In
first
grade
we
had
to
write
twenty
sentences
a
day
using
silly
vocabulary
words
like
"apple"
and
"fork"
before
we
could
play
with
any
of
the
toys,
and
we
could
only
start
two
of
the
twenty
sentences
with
"the."
Let
me
tell
you,
that
was
just
"crummy."
I
can't
think
of
a
more
appropriate
word
to
use
other
than
"crummy,"
and
I
know
I
can
do
better
than
that,
but
this
has
to
be
in
my
"Phil
voice"
or
I
wouldn't
be
true
to
myself
or
to
this
letter
right
now,
even
though
I
know
I
spelled
"crummy"
incorrectly;
call
it
poetic
license,
even
though
this
isn't
poetry...oh
dear.
Where
did
that
poor
sentence
go.
I'm
sorry
(yet
my
sentence
stays,
for
now!)
--
anyway,
I
managed
creative
ways
to
get
around
the
barrier
of
only
using
"the"
twice
to
start
a
sentence,
and
I
was
always
the
second
boy
to
get
to
play
with
the
toys,
right
behind
Tom
Hammond
who
now
goes
to
Penn
State
(I
think)
and
is
a
mighty
Eagle
Scout,
unlike
me.
At
this
point
I
would
like
to
apply
a
disclaimer
to
my
digressions.
As
I
make
my
way
here
through
the
history
of
my
writing
acts,
I
am
simultaneously
attempting
to
show
you
how
my
thoughts
work
currently,
and
how
my
thoughts
translate
to
this
particular
narrative,
and
to
my
writing's
current
state.
This
is
how
I
write
unless
specifically
instructed
not
to.
I
can
certainly
turn
out
that
so
valued,
timeless
research
paper
about
anti-Semitism
in
Chaucer's
Prioress's
Tale,
or
whatever
the
case
may
be.
I
can
do
that
perhaps
even
more
easily
than
I
can
write
freely.
Yet,
consider
this
my
personal
writing,
written
with
my
heart
more
so
than
with
my
skill
as
a
future
writing
associate.
My
hope
is
that
with
this
honesty
I
can
give
you
a
better
narrative
with
which
to
learn
my
writing
history.
Why
must
I
do
this
in
such
a
way?
As
Rilke
would
say,
because
"I
must."
Unequivocally.
Now
where
was
I.
Right
--
in
middle
school
I
had
a
teacher
who
made
me
clean
up
the
bubble
gum
left
under
my
desk
because
she
suspected
I
had
put
some
of
it
there.
I
had
not.
I
held
a
grudge.
She
was
my
English
teacher
for
two
years.
I
never
liked
her
until
I
started
to
realize
that
her
strictness
in
the
classroom
(and
particularly
in
the
grading
of
my
book
reports
and
written
work)
was
slowly
making
me
a
better
writer,
because
she
was
the
first
woman
to
ever
push
me.
My
parents
never
pushed
me
because
they
thought
it
was
bad
parenting;
they
still
think
that
to
make
a
child
do
something
beyond
what
they
need
to
do
will
only
dissuade
them
from
succeeding,
because
a
person
has
to
personally
want
to
excel;
a
person
cannot
be
told
to,
at
least
not
constantly.
Expectation
ruins
the
prize.
My
parents
somehow
gave
me
the
gift
of
wanting
to
do
well
on
my
own,
and
for
that
I
will
always
be
grateful.
They
never
did
my
projects
for
me...not
one
time.
They
never
went
to
college
anyway,
so
they
never
even
felt
comfortable
helping
me
write
a
paper
or
working
out
a
math
problem;
they
only
taught
me
how
to
read.
They
made
it
fun.
I
took
off
from
there,
carefree,
until
Mrs.
Lowman
hit
me
with
her
gummy
desk.
I
had
to
triumph
over
her
and
her
tough
grading,
so
I
did
and
eventually
I
worked
my
way
up
to
never
getting
less
than
a
ninety
percent
on
any
of
her
assignments.
My
parents
never
knew
of
this
psychological
battle
I
had,
and
neither
did
Mrs.
Lowman.
Part
of
me
wonders
why
I
even
attribute
my
bump-up
in
writing
ability
to
Mrs.
Lowman;
perhaps,
it's
because
I
really
did
put
all
that
gum
under
the
desk.
In
high
school
I
drove
myself
up
the
wall
and
hit
my
head
on
the
ceiling.
I
dominated
9th
grade
discussion
on
Lord
of
the
Flies,
but
still
got
only
B's
on
the
exams.
My
papers
always
lifted
my
grades
but
not
quite
enough
to
get
an
A
for
the
quarter.
Mr.
Hudak
promised
me
that
despite
my
B
grade
for
the
year,
I
was
still
his
best
writer.
He
said
the
grades
would
come
in
time...
meanwhile,
"get
on
my
newspaper
staff
and
write
your
heart
out."
I
did
just
that.
My
friend
Craig
and
I
ended
up
ruling
the
school
newspaper
for
all
of
eleventh
and
twelfth
grade;
we
served
as
coeditors
in
chief,
and
we
put
out
the
first
ever
computer-aided
issues
at
our
high
school.
My
friends
still
make
fun
of
me
for
the
notorious
"Phil
Page"
that
came
about,
because
I
single-handedly
wrote
all
of
the
entertainment
stories
and
reviews
for
every
issue,
and
with
Craig
just
about
everything
else
too.
Craig
and
I
received
such
sloppy,
insulting
stories
from
most
of
the
other
students...we
had
to
basically
redo
them
and
still
give
those
students
full
credit
in
the
byline.
We
are
still
bitter
about
that,
but
it
is
only
because
we
cared
at
the
normal
intensity
level,
and
everyone
else
writing
for
the
paper
blew
it
off
because
they
only
wanted
to
get
"newspaper"
printed
on
their
precious
college
resumes.
Shame
on
them.
I'm
not
like
them,
but
I
can
pretend.
Anyway,
between
writing
so
many
newspaper
articles
about
what
the
German
club
did
over
the
weekend,
and
how
the
Foreign
Language
Center
was
coming
along
in
development,
and
how
the
third
Pearl
Jam
album
was
even
cooler
than
the
second,
I
began
embracing
the
concise
newspaper
style
that
would
prepare
me
for
my
eventual
and
continuing
love
of
Hemingway.
Wasn't
that
the
most
facetious
sentence
I've
written
so
far?
I
should
take
it
out
but
I
won't.
The
Sun
Also
Rises
is
my
favorite
novel;
I
can't
do
anything
about
that,
even
with
my
obvious
risk
of
sounding
corny
right
now.
While
all
this
newspaper
writing
was
going
on,
I
was
reading
some
of
the
classics,
some
forcibly
through
high
school
English,
some,
like
The
Sun
Also
Rises,
on
my
own
time.
I
also
began
to
write
seriously
on
my
own
time.
I
took
a
creative
writing
class
in
tenth
grade
and
took
the
same
class
again
senior
year
just
because
it
was
that
good
for
me.
Writing
freely
and
creatively
(hopefully)
allows
one
to
feel
more
comfortable
with
writing
in
general,
so
that
when
they
actually
have
to
sit
down
and
write
something
more
traditional
for
a
class
or
the
like,
the
tension
is
offset.
I
flew
through
my
research
papers
and
was
dangerous
procrastinator
in
high
school,
finishing
my
conclusions
and
printing
out
sometimes
just
five
minutes
before
having
to
be
in
homeroom.
Sometimes
I
had
to
duck
out
on
school
to
procrastinate
further.
Every
time
I
committed
a
Ferris
Buehler
crime
like
that,
I
had
run
out
of
time
because
instead
of
finishing
the
research
paper
the
night
before,
I'd
be
writing
creative
things
on
my
own:
poetry,
and
over
my
senior
year,
an
attempt
at
a
first
novel.
My
first
novel
attempt
--
called
A
Soundtrack
For
Life
--
remains
unfinished
at
forty-seven
pages
(single
spaced)
on
my
computer.
At
this
point
I
hate
it.
I
cannot
finish
something
I
am
unhappy
with
to
begin
with.
It
haunts
me
to
no
end;
there
are
times
when
I
can't
bear
to
stand
still
thinking
about
my
failure
in
this.
Yet
I
cannot
go
on
with
it
--
it
stopped
working
well
on
page
forty-three,
and
beyond
that
there's
nowhere
it
can
go.
I
spent
so
many
hours
on
it...
sometimes
I
wonder
that
if
I
would
have
done
something
else
--
like
study
my
Physics
work
--
the
world
would
be
a
different
place
for
me.
But
I
would
be
a
stranger
to
myself
if
I
wouldn't
have
at
least
tried
--
it
provided
the
entire
backdrop
of
my
senior
year,
at
least
mentally.
Who
knows,
maybe
someday
I
will
discover
how
to
make
more
progress
with
it.
While
I
was
attempting
the
novel
I
got
too
caught
up
in
revising,
making
the
first
forty-three
pages
perfect,
and
forgetting
to
supply
something
more
complete.
It
was
almost
an
extreme
mistake,
but
one
I
have
learned
from.
Since
I
have
been
at
college
I've
made
a
more
conscious
effort
to
simply
write
papers
out,
then
go
back
later
for
corrections.
Still,
ninety
percent
of
everything
I
write
these
days
is
not
conceived
in
this
manner.
I
still
mainly
finalize
my
papers
paragraph
by
paragraph,
usually
in
one
sitting.
I
know
my
methods
are
bad.
I'd
rather
be
honest
about
them,
however,
than
sit
here
and
write
a
fictional
essay
on
how
I
write.
It
wouldn't
be
true!
Oh
well.
My
humor
is
often
in
another
language.
Enough
babbling.
As
you
can
see
I
tend
to
just
write
about
whatever
it
is
I
have
to
write
about
--
for
example,
now
I
am
pulling
a
John
Barth,
writing
about
writing.
When
I
am
writing
about
anything
else
I
tend
to
self-editorialize
just
as
much
as
I
am
doing
now,
constantly
amending
my
thoughts
with
more
thoughts
on
those
thoughts.
For
example,
I
apologize
for
overusing
"thoughts"
in
the
last
sentence,
and
for
not
realizing
that,
until
too
late,
I
could
have
gotten
away
with
using
'"thoughts"
only
twice
because
using
"amending"
should
have
taken
care
of
things.
Of
course
I
won't
delve
into
this
in
an
actual
English
paper,
but
will
do
the
equivalent
thing
when
analyzing
something,
which
would
be
by
describing
things
thoroughly
in
circles.
No
matter
what
the
subject,
my
papers
generally
do
well
when
I
(personally)
don't
think
specifically
about
incorporating
the
traditional
methods.
I
just
write,
and
things
work
out
the
way
I
like.
It's
certainly
not
what
I
would
encourage
to
other
writers!
To
try
and
sum
up
these
ideas,
I
think
I
would
describe
my
current
writing
as
"writing
by
feel"
as
opposed
to
formula.
Yet,
there
is
formula
to
the
way
I
write
by
feel.
Paradox?
Either
way,
my
college
writing
depends
on
a
foolproof
plan,
a
plan
that
I
must
sit
down
and
think
out
in
my
mind
before
I
actually
start
writing.
I
get
a
series
of
ideas
and
then
just
go.
I
don't
take
notes
before
writing
and
I
certainly
never
outline
--
I've
written
some
of
the
best
research
papers
my
high
school
has
ever
seen
by
just
piling
the
members
of
my
bibliography
around
me,
picking
up
sources
nearly
at
random,
and
finding
something
in
them
to
help
tie
the
plan
together.
I
love
doing
that
and
getting
away
with
it...don't
tell
anyone!
I'm
kidding,
but
only
partly.
I
value
honesty
more.
Which
brings
me
back
to
my
current
novel
attempt.
It
is
based
on
the
best
plan
I
have
ever
had.
I
am
so
excited,
I
think
sometimes
my
head
will
cave
in
if
I
get
too
hyped
up
about
it
and
forget
to
just
write.
I've
put
down
guidelines
in
my
mind
of
what
I
want
to
do
with
the
novel,
and
without
giving
any
of
it
away,
let
me
just
say
that
I
know
I
can
come
up
with
the
length
I
need
--
I
want
around
three
hundred
good
pages.
I've
written
only
about
fourteen
pages
so
far,
but
I
like
them
and
I
know
where
I
can
go.
Like
I
said,
I
want
this
to
supply
you
with
a
footnote
someday.
Here's
hoping!
