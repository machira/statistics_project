My
history
as
a
writer
began
the
moment
I
wrote
down
my
first
letter,
the
letter
A.
I
didnOt
exactly
write
the
letter
A,
I
actually
traced
along
the
dotted
lines
in
Kindergarten
class.
Nonetheless,
the
moment
my
pencil
touched
the
paper
my
history
as
a
writer
began.
I
do
not
remember
this
exact
moment,
nor
do
I
remember
any
other
historical
landmarks
in
my
writing
career
for
the
next
couple
of
years.
The
little
evidence
I
have
that
I
actually
did
write,
is
found
in
an
old
box
underneath
my
bed,
which
I
recovered
for
this
assignment.
One
particular
story
I
wrote
in
first
grade
goes
as
follows:
NOne
day
I
wack
[wake]
with
a
foot
snoo
[snow]
I
yell
and
ma
and
pa
wack
[wake]
up
I
got
drest
[dressed]
and
wet
[went]
outside
and
played
and
played
and
played
until
Ma
and
Pa
culd
[called]
me
to
dinner
I
eat
and
eat
and
eat.O
My
story
was
handwritten
on
lined
paper
and
was
accompanied
with
a
picture
of
me
playing
in
the
snow.
My
teacher
wrote
NA
delightful
story!O
at
the
top
of
my
paper,
despite
the
constant
misspellings
and
the
lack
of
punctuation.
The
next
writing
assignment
I
can
remember
was
two
years
later
in
third
grade.
The
assignment
was
on
Christopher
Columbus.
It
was
required
to
be
handwritten
and
in
cursive,
something
I
did
not
enjoy.
Back
in
1993,
the
internet
was
not
yet
at
our
fingertips
for
information,
so
my
mother
drove
me
to
the
library
and
I
researched
the
life
of
Christopher
Columbus
using
the
encyclopedia
and
a
couple
of
biographies.
The
paper
was
two
and
a
half
pages
long,
in
cursive,
and
it
included
several
paragraphs
(something
I
was
very
proud
of
at
the
time).This
was
my
first
big
writing
assignment,
and
I
remember
being
extremely
nervous
as
to
my
grade.
However,
I
never
did
find
out
my
grade.
Mrs.
Hausfield,
my
third
grade
teacher,
was
notorious
for
collecting
assignments
and
never
handing
them
back.
My
history
as
a
writer
jumps
to
fifth
grade,
where
writing
assignments
became
more
frequent.
Similar
to
fourth
grade,
a
book
report
was
due
every
month.
However
in
fifth
grade,
the
assignments
became
more
difficult.
Not
only
did
we
have
to
sum
up
the
book,
but
we
had
to
include
a
paragraph
where
we
analyzed
the
book.
Mr.
Baker
explained
that
an
analysis
on
the
book
meant
to
dissect
the
book,
in
the
same
way
someone
would
dissect
an
earthworm.
We
should
ask
ourselves
questions
such
as:
Are
there
any
themes
in
the
book?
What
are
the
characters
goals?
What
does
the
ending
signify?
I
do
not
remember
what
my
first
book
report
was
on,
but
I
do
remember
my
grade:
C.
I
was
absolutely
horrified.
I
had
excelled
in
NReadingO
my
entire
life.
I
did
not
understand
why
I
received
a
C.
Mr.
BakerOs
large
red
C
was
accompanied
by
the
words
NNeeds
more
analysisO.
I
was
embarrassed
and
confused,
but
I
did
not
want
to
receive
another
C
on
my
next
book
report.
I
went
to
my
mother
for
help.
She
read
over
my
paper,
and
then
asked
NHoney,
do
you
know
what
analysis
is?O
I
answered
that
I
thought
I
did,
but
I
guess
not.
She
explained
to
me
that
analyzing
a
book
isnOt
that
difficult.
I
remember
her
telling
me,
NPeople
read
in
order
to
learn.
You
read
in
school
to
learn
more
about
different
things.
Analysis
is
a
tool
for
learning.
LetOs
say
you
read
a
book
in
an
hour,
and
then
forget
about
it.
You
donOt
remember
anything,
and
therefore
you
donOt
learn
anything.
When
you
analyze
a
book,
you
think
about
what
the
book
means.
What
message
is
the
author
trying
to
teach
the
reader?O
I
remember
asking
my
mom
NBut
what
if
I
donOt
understand
the
message?
Or
what
if
I
donOt
get
it
right?O
She
answered,
NThat
is
the
beauty
of
books.
Everybody
takes
something
different
away
from
them.
That
way
we
can
learn
from
each
other.
Nobody
might
ever
know
exactly
what
the
author
means,
but
we
sure
can
guessO.
This
advice
helped
me
for
my
next
report:
I
received
an
A.
In
fact,
this
advice
has
helped
me
throughout
my
entire
writing
career.
In
fifth
grade
I
learned
that
you
canOt
always
know
exactly
what
the
author
is
trying
to
say,
but
sometimes,
that
is
what
makes
writing
fun.
To
be
able
to
come
up
with
your
own
ideas,
your
own
thesis,
your
own
opinionsNit
is
part
of
the
process
of
learning.
In
sixth
grade,
writing
became
a
constant
part
of
my
education.
We
were
drilled
with
the
concept
of
the
NFive
Paragraph
EssayO.
The
Five
Paragraph
Essay
obviously
consisted
of
five
paragraphs.
There
was
the
introductory
paragraph
where
you
introduced
your
paperOs
three
main
points.
Then
there
were
the
three
body
paragraphs.
In
each
paragraph
you
elaborated
each
point
thoroughly.
The
fifth
paragraph
was
called
the
conclusion,
where
you
summed
up
your
paper.
I
enjoyed
the
Five
Paragraph
Essay;
it
made
writing
simple,
easy
and
formulaic.
We
used
the
Five
Paragraph
Essay
as
a
tool
for
all
different
types
of
genres:
persuasive
essays,
research
papers
and
my
personal
favorite,
creative
writing.
Sixth
grade
is
my
first
memory
of
writing
creatively.
Our
assignment
was
as
follows:
Write
a
story
using
the
Five
Paragraph
Essay
format.
I
thought
for
a
while
about
what
to
write
about,
and
I
decided
(as
I
still
often
do
today)
to
write
a
story
about
an
experience
of
mine.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
decided
that
I
absolutely
loved
writing.
The
words
flowed
out
of
my
fingertips
and
onto
the
computer
screen
as
I
happily
typed
away.
My
story
went
as
follows:
During
my
fifth
grade
winter
break
my
family
had
decided
to
go
on
a
trip
to
the
Caribbean.
My
grandmother
had
lived
there
for
half
of
her
life,
and
having
passed
away
recently,
we
were
traveling
down
there
to
spread
her
ashes
in
the
Caribbean
ocean
as
we
sailed
from
port
to
port.
At
the
age
of
ten,
I
was
rather
worried
about
a
number
of
things
pertaining
to
our
voyage,
including
sharks,
hurricanes
and
crime.
I
explained
my
fears
and
how
my
mother
assuaged
them
in
the
introductory
paragraph.
In
the
following
body
paragraphs,
I
explained
how
each
and
every
one
of
my
fears
actually
happened,
proving
my
mother
wrong.
We
saw
sharks
while
we
were
snorkeling,
we
were
caught
in
a
hurricane
while
sailing
(and
barely
made
it
out
alive)
and
my
motherOs
suitcase
was
stolen
from
the
car.
My
conclusion
summed
up
the
experience
and
a
moral
was
tacked
on
to
the
end
of
the
essay:
Parents
do
not
know
everything.
I
received
an
excellent
grade
on
my
paper,
and
it
was
from
then
on
that
I
decided
I
loved
creative
writing.
I
was
not
able
to
experiment
with
my
writing
creatively
in
school
until
I
was
a
sophomore
in
high
school.
Sophomore
year
English
was
mostly
geared
toward
creative
writing.
We
had
multiple
creative
writing
assignments
in
English
class
throughout
the
year,
and
by
the
end
of
the
year
every
sophomore
was
required
to
hand
in
a
twenty
page
creative
narrative
that
was
worth
20
percent
of
our
grade.
Of
course,
the
assignment
was
very
exciting
to
me
and
similar
to
my
previous
creative
writing
assignments,
the
words
flowed
out
of
me
like
water.
I
wrote
a
twenty
page
narrative
sorting
out
issues
I
had
with
a
friend
IOd
had
since
kindergarten,
who
I
only
had
contact
with
occasionally
since
I
went
to
private
high
school
and
she
went
to
the
local
public
school.
At
the
end
of
the
year
I
received
an
award
for
my
narrative,
but
the
excitement
of
winning
didnOt
even
compare
to
the
satisfaction
I
felt
after
finally
sorting
out
the
lifelong
issues
I
had
with
my
friend.
Up
until
then,
that
was
my
best
experience
as
a
writer.
I
did
not
find
junior
year
English
as
satisfying
as
sophomore
year.
Junior
year
English
was
completely
analytical
writing,
in
order
to
prepare
us
for
the
Junior
Writing
Exam
in
May.
The
JWE
was
worth
30
percent
of
our
English
grade,
and
was
a
required
test
of
every
Junior
in
the
Illinois
private
school
sytstem.
The
JWE
consisted
of
the
following:
every
student
read
the
assigned
short
story
the
night
before
the
test.
At
the
exam
the
next
day,
each
student
received
the
same
question
and
the
same
amount
of
time
to
answer
the
question
in
essay
form.
The
question
required
intense
analysis.
I
struggled
more
with
this
type
of
writing
than
anything
else,
and
although
I
did
well
on
the
JWE,
I
did
not
do
as
well
as
I
would
have
liked
to.
It
wasnOt
until
senior
year,
when
I
took
AP
English
with
Dr.
Bird,
did
I
receive
the
guidance
I
truly
needed
to
help
me
with
this
type
of
writing.
Dr.
Bird
always
said
that
the
only
thing
that
will
improve
your
writing
is
practice,
and
practice
we
did.
AP
English
was
different
from
junior
year
English,
because
instead
of
writing
five,
7-paged,
typed
essays
a
year,
we
wrote
three-paged,
handwritten
essays
every
other
day.
We
were
constantly
writing,
reading
each
other
works,
getting
advice
and
improving
ourselves
as
writers.
Dr.
Bird
encouraged
us
in
class,
and
met
with
us
privately,
in
order
to
discuss
ways
to
improve
our
writing.
It
was
in
AP
English
where
I
truly
learned
to
analyze
readings,
formulate
my
own
ideas,
and
record
these
thoughts
on
paper.
It
was
also
where
I
learned
to
make
connections
throughout
different
parts
of
the
readings
and
apply
them
to
my
ideas.
If
it
had
not
been
for
AP
English,
and
the
help
of
Dr.
Bird,
I
would
have
not
been
prepared
for
college
writing.
For
the
most
part,
I
did
not
have
any
expectations
for
college
writing.
To
be
perfectly
honest,
in
the
weeks
before
I
left
for
school,
I
was
much
more
worried
about
adjusting
to
college
life
than
the
academic
portion
of
my
college
career.
My
parents
have
always
encouraged
me
to
try
my
best
in
school
and
not
to
worry
too
much
about
the
outcome,
especially
as
a
freshman
in
college.
I
did
not
find
my
first
FYS
assignment
particularly
difficult,
because
it
was
similar
to
the
assignments
I
had
in
AP
English.
I
do
find
however,
as
my
years
progress
at
Lafayette
and
as
the
levels
of
my
classes
increase,
the
writing
assignments
do
increase
in
difficulty.
I
took
my
first
300
level
English
course
this
past
semester,
and
I
found
both
the
readings
and
the
writing
assignments
much
more
difficult
than
my
previous
courses.
Being
challenged,
however,
is
part
of
the
learning
process
and
I
eventually
adjusted
to
the
new
level
of
difficulty.
This
past
semester
I
also
took
a
course
in
creative
writing
at
Lafayette,
and
true
to
form,
it
was
my
favorite
course
in
my
career
at
Lafayette.
In
Creative
Writing,
our
class
wrote
both
poems
and
short
stories,
as
well
as
read
constantly.
Our
professor
had
a
similar
philosophy
to
Dr.
Bird:
Read
and
write
a
lot.
I
loved
the
courseNit
was
fun,
interesting
and
new.
Each
week
we
had
different
writing
assignments
due.
We
often
read
them
out
loud
to
the
class
and
sometimes
discussed
them.
I
must
admit,
reading
my
work
out
loud
was
something
I
had
never
done
before
and
I
was
terrified
the
first
time
I
stood
behind
the
podium
to
read
a
poem.
In
the
end,
however,
it
turned
out
to
be
great
experience.
My
writing
improved
throughout
the
semester,
and
it
was
so
much
fun
to
watch
the
growth
of
my
writing.
When
I
came
home
for
the
summer,
I
dug
out
my
old
sophomore
narrative
and
was
absolutely
horrified
about
the
caliber
of
my
writing.
I
realized
though,
that
four
years
from
now,
I
will
read
my
old
works
from
Creative
Writing
and
will
once
again,
be
horrified,
and
so
on
and
so
on.
That
is
what
makes
writing
interesting:
noticing
the
changes
and
improvements
in
your
writing
over
time.
Not
only
do
I
hope
to
help
others
understand
their
writing
and
improve
their
work
more,
but
I
hope
to
help
myself
as
well.
Hopefully,
being
a
Writing
Assistant
will
help
me
to
look
at
my
writing
in
a
different
way
and
notice
what
improvements
I
can
make
in
my
own
work,
thereby
continuing
my
history
as
a
writer.
