I
can
remember
sitting
on
the
arm
of
my
family's
large,
navy
blue
living
room
chair,
bent
down
over
a
shinny
wooden
table,
thick
red
pencil
clutched
awkwardly
in
my
hand.
The
scene
remains
quite
vivid;
it
was
night
time,
the
light
of
the
lamp
cast
strange
shadows
over
the
white
paper
laid
out
before
me.
I
pressed
the
graphite
of
the
pencil
onto
the
paper,
and,
continuously
licking
my
lips
in
deep
concentration,
began
to
write
the
letters
of
my
name.
The
lines
were
shaky,
the
letters
neither
capitol
nor
lowercase,
but
a
strange
mixture
of
the
two,
the
name
itself
so
slanted
on
the
page
it
looked
is
if
it
would
drip
right
off
as
soon
as
the
paper
was
lifted
into
the
air.
I'm
sure
my
parents
ohhhed
and
awwwed
over
this
first
attempt
at
writing
-
no
doubt
they
were
thoroughly
pleased.
But
I
don't
remember
their
reaction,
for
I
was
too
amazed
that
the
dark
marks
on
the
page,
marks
that
actually
were
a
representation
of
my
own
language,
had
come
from
the
tip
of
my
oversized,
wooden
red
pencil.
Though
I
have
never
realized
it
before
now,
second
grade,
years
after
my
first
name-writing
epiphany,
was
a
momentous
year
in
the
history
of
my
writing
career.
Not
only
did
I
learn
the
fundamentals
of
cursive,
or
script
writing,
but
I
also
had
the
opportunity
to
experiment
typing
on
a
computer.
From
the
very
beginning,
I
detested
writing
in
cursive.
My
teacher
explained
that
it
would
help
us
write
faster,
and,
more
importantly,
cursive
appeared
more
"mature"
than
regular
old
printing.
Yet,
for
me,
cursive
was
a
labor
intensive
activity,
full
of
mess-ups
and
strange
errors.
The
paper
we
wrote
on
was
very
thin
recycled
newspaper,
the
kind
that
wore
away
into
great
holes
when
one
attempted
to
erase
the
numerous
mistakes.
This,
of
course,
gave
my
writing
assignment
homeworks
the
appearance
of
pieces
of
discarded
trash.

Literacy
Narrative
Needless
to
say,
I
appreciated
what
the
computer,
located
outside
the
classroom
in
the
large
and
long
hallway,
had
to
offer
me.
It
was
on
this
very
computer
that
I
composed
my
very
first
piece
of
fiction,
entitled
"Flat
Caitie."
After
reading
and
discussing
Tall
Tales
(Paul
Bunyon,
and
the
like),
our
assignment
was
to
write
a
Tall
Tale
of
our
own.
My
tall
tale
was
about
a
girl,
aptly
named
"Caitie,"
that
gets
run
over
by
a
steamroller,
only
to
have
her
body
completely
flattened
like
a
pancake.
While
she
is
ambling
about
town
in
this
flattened
state,
she
accidentally
walks
over
a
sewer,
slips
through
the
metal
bars,
and
goes
on
to
have
numerous
exciting
adventures
with
a
variety
of
interesting
creatures
down
in
the
Land
of
the
Sewers.
In
its
entirety,
the
story
was
probably
not
more
than
a
page
and
a
half.
However,
when
one
really
does
not
know
how
to
type,
a
page
and
a
half
can
take
over
two
excruciating
hours
of
searching
for
letters
on
the
key
board.
But
finally
I
did
finish
typing
it,
I
illustrated
it,
and
when
I
presented
it
to
my
teacher,
Ms.
Jacoby,
she
immediately
and
joyously
ran
out
to
the
hallway
and
hung
it
on
the
wall
for
the
entire
school
to
see.
Peculiarly
enough,
any
and
all
writing
between
the
"Flat
Caitie"
adventure
and
my
freshman
year
of
high
school
seems
to
be
rather
in
a
blur.
I
know
I
sporadically
kept
many
diaries
and
journals
during
this
time,
primarily
filled
with
gossip
and
crushes
and
adolescent
fights
with
my
mother
and
brother.
But
I
cannot,
for
some
reason,
specifically
recollect
any
writing
I
did
in
school,
though
I
know
I
did
quite
a
bit
of
it.
What
I
do
remember,
however,
was
that
I
did
a
great
deal
of
reading.
Novels,
magazines,
short
stories,
non-fiction,
and
even
quite
a
bit
of
poetry
was
what
I
spent
many
many
days
pouring
over.
When
I
arrived
at
The
Lawrenceville
School
at
the
age
of
fourteen,
I
had
never
once
thought
of
myself
as
a
writer
or
not
as
a
writer.
To
tell
the
truth,
I
hadn't
ever
been
given
a
writing
assignment
in
elementary
or
middle
school
that
called
for
any
kind
of
intense
thought,
any
kind
of
lengthy
research,
or
any
kind
of
real
time
commitment.
Up
until
my
fourteenth
year,
I
would
do
my
assignments,
hand
them
in,
forget
about
them
until
they
were
returned
to
me
graded,
and
then
simply
throw
them
in
the
trash.
This
all
changed
immediately
in
the
fall
of
my
freshman
year
with
Mr.
Tredway.
"Treds"
as
he
was
known,
was
loved
by
all
students.
He
was
a
short
little
man
with
a
loud
laugh
and
red
hair.
He
had
a
great
mind
and
was
such
an
excellent
writer
that
once,
after
he
had
written
a
response
to
an
article
in
the
school
newspaper,
the
entire
faculty
and
student
body
were
so
flabbergasted
at
the
clearness
and
the
force
with
which
he
wrote,
it
was
the
talk
of
the
school
for
many
weeks
after.
Tredway
tore
apart
my
inexperienced
attempts
at
my
very
first
analytical
paper
on
J.R.R.
Tolkein's
The
Hobbit.
Even
after
I
rewrote
it,
he
still
gave
me
a
less
than
mediocre
grade
on
the
paper.
This
persisted
throughout
the
entire
semester
until
the
final
paper.
We
had
been
studying
myth
and
folklore,
and
our
assignment
was
to
write
a
myth
of
our
own.
I
can
remember
slaving
over
my
computer
for
hours,
full
of
frustration
and
anxiety,
knowing
that
these
long
hours
spent
writing
were
all
for
not
-
that
I
would
hand
it
in
only
to
receive
it
back
full
of
red
ink
and
disparaging
comments.
Fortunately,
I
had
finally
done
something
fairly
correctly,
for
my
myth
was
returned
to
me
with
many
glowing
comments
and
the
first
"B"
I
had
seen
all
semester.
The
next
five
trimesters
of
English
were
a
succession
excellent
teachers
and
of
intense
learning
sessions.
I
learned
to
almost
master
the
art
of
analyzing
both
fiction
and
poetry,
how
to
write
an
argument
paper,
how
to
write
a
character
sketch,
how
to
compare
two
works
of
literature
in
one
paper.
Though
I
was
still
not
receiving
"A's,"
my
grades
were
steadily
improving,
as
were
the
teachers'
comments,
as
was,
most
importantly,
my
knowledge
and
experience
of
the
different
genres
of
writing.
It
was
my
junior
year
at
Lawrenceville,
however,
that
was
the
groundbreaking
year
in
my
writing
career,
and
it
took
place
under
the
tutelage
of
the
finest
of
English
teachers,
Mrs.
Leita
Hamill.
For
some
reason,
all
of
my
intellectual
powers
somehow
"clicked"
over
the
summer
while
I
was
traveling
around
California
and
Oregon.
When
I
returned
to
school,
I
suddenly
was
writing
"A"
papers
in
all
of
my
classes.
I
use
the
word
"suddenly"
because
that
is
exactly
what
it
was
like.
I
didn't
feel
or
think
that
I
was
doing
anything
much
different
than
before,
but
suddenly
my
teachers
became
delighted
with
my
writing,
particularly
Mrs.
Hamill.
The
first
trimester
I
had
her
as
a
teacher
was
in
the
winter
of
my
junior
year,
during
which
we
studied
poetry
and
read
McBeth.
This
couldn't
have
been
any
better
for
me
since
I
had
developed
a
love
for
it
already
on
my
own,
and
had
always
wished
to
read
the
famous
McBeth.
Mrs.
Hamill
went
to
great
lengths
to
push
us
to
be
stellar
writers,
most
importantly
showing
us
the
proper
way
in
which
to
weave
specific
quotes
from
the
text
to
prove
our
arguments,
to
back
up
our
statements
with
examples
from
the
work.
Most
of
us
did
improve
immensely
by
the
shear
fact
that
we
were
writing
all
the
time.
She
would
assign
us
a
paper
each
Friday,
and
have
it
due
the
next
Thursday.
It
seemed
as
though
I
would
sit
in
front
of
my
computer
writing
away
for
an
entire
week,
only
to
finally
finish
the
paper
and
get
another
one
assigned
the
next
day.
Being
forced
to
write
so
many
papers
that
semester,
I
believe,
was
the
key
factor
in
really,
truly
forcing
good
habits/traits
into
my
writing
style.
That
trimester,
to
go
along
with
our
study
of
poetry,
we
were
also
instructed
to
create
our
own
poetry
anthology.
It
was
a
semester
long
project
in
which
each
of
us
chose
the
poems
we
wished
to
be
included,
illustrated
the
anthology,
and
then
wrote
both
a
general
editor's
note
to
the
reader,
as
well
as
an
editorial
note
about
each
poem
that
we
chose.
I
was
a
bit
nervous
to
hand
it
in,
worried
that
Mrs.
Hamill
would
find
my
choices
strange
and
my
editorial
comments
bizarre.
Because
it
contained
some
of
my
own
poetry,
I
felt
almost
silly
about
sharing
it
with
a
teacher.
Much
to
my
elation,
however,
Mrs.
Hamill
enjoyed
mine
so
much
that
she
used
it
as
her
example
in
a
presentation
to
the
faculty
on
our
class.
This,
of
course,
filled
me
with
a
great
deal
of
pride.
The
next
trimester,
I
was
lucky
enough
to
be
in
Mrs.
Hamill's
class
once
again,
yet
this
time
she
"upped
the
ante"
a
bit.
Instead
of
giving
us
paper
topics
she
had
brainstormed,
she
decided
that
it
was
time
for
each
student
to
think
up
his
or
her
own
paper
topic.
Also,
she
cut
down
on
the
number
of
papers,
but
demanded
longer,
better,
and
more
comprehensive
ones.
Once
again,
in
order
to
write
the
type
of
paper
she
was
looking
for,
I
was
forced
to
put
to
use
the
close
reading,
the
pulling
out
of
quotes
from
the
text,
the
powers
of
comparison
and
argument
that
I
had
been
taught.
She
demanded
that
we
write
in
our
own
voices,
as
simply
and
clearly
as
possible,
rather
than
attempting
to
sound
like
Ph.D..
candidates
from
Harvard.
I
still
had
no
earthly
idea
what
it
was
in
my
writing
that
my
teachers
thought
was
so
excellent.
In
my
mind,
I
was
simply
doing
the
assignments
as
assigned
-1
did
not
feel
I
had
any
talent.
It
wasn't
until
senior
year
in
high
school
that
I
began
to
catch
on.
I
was
living
and
going
to
school
in
France,
and
one
day
an
American
friend
of
mine
asked
me
to
proof
read
his
English
paper.
I
gladly
agreed.
I
settled
down
in
a
large
comfortable
chair
ready
to
read
an
interesting
and
thought
provoking
paper
by
a
very
intelligent
person.
To
my
utter
surprise,
his
paper
was
absolutely
horrible
-
punctuation
mistakes,
grammatical
errors,
whole
sentences
and
paragraphs
which
made
no
sense.
Up
until
that
point,
I
honestly
thought
folks
my
age
were
all,
more
or
less,
at
the
same
writing
level.
It
was
this
experience
that
showed
me,
loud
and
clear,
that
my
skill
as
a
writer,
what
ever
it
may
be,
is
not
something
to
take
for
granted.
And
indeed
I
do
not
take
it
for
granted.
When
I
arrived
at
Lafayette,
I
knew
that
I
could
write
fairly
clearly,
and
I
knew
I
wanted
to
be
an
English
major,
but
I
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
as
far
as
writing
levels
in
college
were
concerned.
It
took
me
over
an
hour
to
even
comprehend
my
first
paper
topic
in
English.
Once
I
finally
did
grasp
what
the
professor
wanted,
I
simply
did
what
I
always
did;
raked
through
the
text,
pulled
out
as
many
quotes
as
I
possible
could,
developed
a
thesis,
and
away
I
went.
It
took
me
an
entire
day
to
write
the
five
pages,
but
the
work
paid
off.
In
each
paper
I
wrote
last
year,
I
merely
stuck
to
simplicity,
clearness,
and
many,
many
quotes,
and
thankfully
it
seems
to
be
working!
I
then
joined
The
Lafayette,
and
was
subjected
to
a
whole
other
genre
of
writing
-journalism.
It
was
rather
leam-as-you-go
at
the
Lafayette,
and
I
learned
very
quickly
the
basic
journalistic
tools
-
weaving
parts
of
interviews
and
people's
quotes
into
straightforward,
clear
articles,
inventing
exciting
leads,
and
making
very
sure
to
keep
any
personal
opinions
out.
I
became
very
familiar
with
the
pressure
and
excitement
of
what
it
feels
like
to
write
under
a
deadline.
I
learned
how
gratifying
it
feels
to
work
hard
on
a
piece,
and
then
to
actually
see
it
in
print,
complete
with
by-line,
each
Friday
morning.
I
loved
being
able
to
walk
around
Farinon
and
see
the
reaction
to
our
articles
on
the
faces
of
the
students.
The
biggest
thrill
of
my
Lafayette
journalism
career
thus
far
was
being
given
the
honor
of
writing
the
Pepper
Prize
winner
article
on
Kristen
Amey.
I
knew
it
was
an
article
almost
everybody
would
read,
so
I
tried
desperately
to
make
it
as
good
as
possible,
and
was
pleased
with
the
results.
Again,
writing
an
article
a
week,
in
addition
to
my
other
papers
and
exams,
provided
me
with
a
constant
playground
in
which
to
practice,
to
experiment,
and
really
to
hone
my
writing
skills
to
what
they
are
today.
Thankfully,
Fll
have
the
same
opportunities
to
write
this
year,
in
addition
to
contributing
to
The
Marquis
as
a
way
of
getting
a
little
creative
writing
into
the
picture.
Because
I've
gotten
to
watch
my
progression
from
a
very
mediocre
high
school
writer
to
whatever
kind
I
am
today,
I
have
a
very
large
appreciation
for
my
new
found
abilities.
I
would,
perhaps,
like
someday
to
do
something
in
the
field
of
writing,
whether
it
be
as
a
journalist,
or
in
a
publishing
house.
But,
whatever
happens,
writing
will
always
be
something
that
I
enjoy
very
much.
