Although
the
previous
selection
is
an
example
of
one
of
my
earlier
ventures
in
writing,
it
is
not
the
earliest
one
I
remember.
The
earliest
memory
I
have
in
which
I
actually
remember
writing
is
in
a
journal
in
third
grade.
This
remains
a
poignant
memory
for
several
reasons.
The
first
one
is
the
lone
fact
that
cursive
was
a
requirement
for
these
particular
journal
entries.
Cursive
was
always,
and
to
this
day,
remains
a
mystery
to
me.
Simple
printing
always
worked
best
for
me
and
despite
the
desperate
attempts
of
my
grade
school
teachers
there
was
no
way
I
was
writing
in
such
a
strict
form.
The
second
reason
I
remember
this
big,
black,
clumsy
journal
is
the
fact
that
I
was
forced
to
tote
it
on
my
vacation
to
Florida.
My
insensitive
teacher
insisted
that
I
account
for
my
events
at
Disney
World,
reiterating
that
I
would
enjoy
them
later.
I
have
yet
to
realize
the
significance
of
my
ride
on
Magic
Mountain,
but
I
suppose
I
appreciate
the
attempt
to
keep
me
writing.
From
this
point,
I
can
not
recall
an
instance
where
I
literally
despised
writing.
There
were
certainly
scenarios
in
which
I
would
probably
rather
have
been
doing
something
besides
writing,
yet
I
never
possessed
a
strong
hatred
towards
it,
like
many
people
do.
The
oddity
in
my
writing
however
is
that
I
never
acknowledged
the
love
of
doing
it
until
recently.
When
I
was
in
fifth
grade,
my
older
brother
in
seventh,
I
felt
the
first
instance
of
being
overshadowed.
Assigned
a
composition
in
which
he
needed
to
clearly
depict
a
scene
from
his
childhood,
my
brother
chose
to
write
about
milking
the
cows
on
the
farm
my
family
owns.
Noticing
the
talent
my
brother
possessed,
his
teacher
submitted
it
to
a
young
literary
magazine.
The
next
month,
the
essay
appeared
in
the
magazine
and
dozens
of
copies
on
our
coffee
table.
I
have
never
hated
my
brother
for
his
talent
in
the
writing
field.
Instead
I
maintained
feeling
of
admiration
as
well
as
a
raging
jealousy.
My
writing
did
not
exhibit
confidence,
rather
was
inhibited
by
my
own
reservations.
These
reservations
were
apparently
obvious
when
I
entered
my
freshman
year
of
high
school.
I
enrolled
in
the
honors
English
class
as
a
shy,
intimidated
writer
with
a
quiet
attitude
and
demeanor.
I
left
the
ninth
grade
on
the
track
to
the
writer
I
am
today.
My
teacher
for
this
course
was
Mrs.
Kathleen
Peabody.
She
was
notorious
for
being
the
best
teacher
in
the
strong
English
department
at
Groton-Dunstable
High
School.
My
brother
had
had
her
and
promised
me
I
would
never
stop
realizing
the
magnitude
of
her
tutorial.
I
was
scared
out
of
my
mind.
At
the
beginning
of
the
year,
I
did
more
analyzing
and
interpretation
than
I
ever
have
or
done
since.
We
spent
a
month
analyzing
each
other's
analyzations
and
expanding
To
Kill
A
Mockingbird
further
than
Harper
Lee
could
have
ever
expected.
When
we
finally
reached
what
Mrs.
Peabody
believed
to
be
our
analytical
limit,
she
assigned
us
to
write
a
standard
essay.
I
wrote
a
ten
page
essay,
inserting
all
the
data
in
a
list
fashion.
I
was
proud
of
the
length
based
on
my
preconceived
notions
that
the
length
of
a
paper
determines
its
effectiveness.
My
first
lesson
from
Mrs.
Peabody
was
the
quality
beats
quantity
nearly
every
time.
She
tore
my
paper
a
part,
dissecting
my
conclusions
even
further
that
I
ever
thought
was
imaginable.
There
was
a
certain
quality
of
Mrs.
Peabody
that
was
different
than
any
other
teacher.
She
thought
in
a
completely
separate
way.
And
she
had
the
ability
to
provoke
this
thought
process
from
the
ordinary
person.
Mrs.
Peabody
grasped
small,
overlooked
details
and
turned
them
into
the
main
focus.
Another
aspect
of
this
past
period
class
was
the
amount
of
verbal
participation
that
it
required.
Mrs.
Peabody
encouraged
every
student
to
voice
their
opinions
on
readings
and
required
feedback
to
these
statements.
Public
speaking
is
something
I
have
always
hated.
My
mother
always
told
me
that
for
someone
with
such
a
loud
voice,
I
should
learn
to
use
it.
I
remember
the
first
time
I
was
asked
to
make
a
contribution
to
the
group
discussion.
I
stated
me
opinion
on
the
African-American
race's
role
in
Lee's
novel,
drawing
a
large
and
bold
conclusion
on
Lee's
intent.
Mrs.
Peabody
looked
at
me
like
I
had
two
heads
and
that
I
had
a
strange
vine
growing
out
of
these
heads
as
well.
At
first
I
thought
it
was
the
comment
that
I
had
made
that
was
so
unusual.
I
then
looked
at
my
classmates
to
see
if
they
shared
her
perplexed
look.
My
teacher
then
drew
a
long
breath
and
stated
that
she
would
be
interested
in
what
I
had
to
say
if
there
was
anyway
possible
she
could
hear
me.
My
class
laughed
and
I
sat
there,
unsure
whether
I
should
be
embarrassed
or
relieved.
The
year
continued,
each
quarter
harder
than
the
last.
My
writing
style
along
with
my
public
voice
progressed
from
a
monotonous
set-form
and
expanded
to
a
more
freeform
rubric.
I
was
not
limited
by
the
confines
of
an
assignment
or
by
my
reservations
of
whether
or
not
what
I
was
writing
was
correct.
Mrs.
Peabody,
in
her
subtle
way,
demonstrated
that
writing
is
a
delicate
process.
There
are
certain
grammar
stipulations
that
can
convey
a
certain
effectiveness
in
a
paper.
Yet
the
thesis
and
opinions
formed
in
a
paper
have
no
set
rules
as
formulating
a
chemical
equations
does.
No
one
can
tell
a
writer
what
to
think
or
what
is
right.
Although
I
have
never
been
able
to
write
or
read
poetry
with
such
ease
as
other,
I
maintain
a
deep
sense
of
admiration
and
respect
towards
it.
Although
an
aspect
of
poetry
or
writing
may
not
make
sense
to
me,
it
takes
a
form
of
clarity
for
someone
else,
which
makes
it
right.
The
next
three
years
of
writing
in
high
school
were
built
on
the
basis
of
Mrs.
Peabody's
teachings.
With
her
encouragement
that
my
public
speaking
voice
was
getting
better
with
each
quarter,
I
found
myself
in
a
position
I
would
have
never
imagine
possible
at
the
beginning
of
my
freshman
year;
I
stood
in
from
of
all
one-hundred
plus
of
my
classmates
and
successfully
convinced
them
to
vote
me
into
class
office.
Although
she
succumbed
to
cancer
four
years
ago,
I
still
can
hear
her
voice
vividly
telling
me
to
speak
with
what
she
referred
to
as
my
"fourth
quarter
voice".
When
senior
year
approached,
the
apprehension
about
applying
for
admission
to
college
was
high.
The
majority
of
my
friends
chose
colleges
that
did
not
require
a
lot
of
essays.
Writing
was
no
limitation
on
my
college
selection
process,
as
I
wrote
a
total
of
fourteen
essays
for
eight
colleges.
My
writing
sequence
involving
these
essays
was
most
likely
extremely
similar
to
other
high
school
seniors;
I
wrote
it,
I
rewrote
it,
I
analyzed
it,
I
tore
it
apart,
I
threw
it
out,
finally
rewriting
an
entirely
new
essay.
I
was
never
satisfied
completely
with
the
final
outcome.
Yet
I
had
slaved
over
them
and
figured
that
the
strong
points
of
my
essays
would
overshadow
my
poor
SAT
scores
and
only
slightly
above
average
grades.
Although
the
college
acceptances
did
no
necessarily
reflect
my
expectations,
I
was
more
disappointed
in
the
fact
that
these
schools
could
not
see
the
effort
I
had
especially
placed
in
my
writing,
When
deciding
on
a
school,
I
was
tom
between
Lafayette
College
and
Ithaca
College.
I
thought
that
whichever
one
I
decided
would
be
inconsequential
since
I
was
truly
waiting
for
my
acceptance
from
Villanova
University
off
the
waiting
list.
Yet
there
was
the
possibility
of
a
rejection
from
Villanova,
so
I
had
to
ultimately
choose
with
care.
I
chose
Lafayette
on
a
simple
fact;
the
personalized
touch
in
my
acceptance
letter
commenting
on
my
entrance
essay.
I
remember
the
look
on
my
mother's
face
when
she
read
the
detailed
acceptance
letter.
She
was
shocked
at
the
contrast
between
Lafayette's
acceptance
letter
and
the
form
letter
the
majority
of
universities
and
colleges
send
out.
She
looked
at
me
and
said
that
"this
is
the
one"
.
My
acceptance
letter
from
Villanova
never
came.
By
the
time
I
reached
Lafayette
College,
I
was
pretty
confident
that
my
writing
was
more
than
adequate.
Even
though
my
First
Year
Seminar
course
was
on
the
study
of
science,
I
was
sure
that
I
could
handle
any
sort
of
writing.
The
only
aspect
in
which
I
was
a
bit
cautious
was
the
fact
that
we
only
had
three
papers
to
do
this
being
our
lone
grading
material.
In
my
approach
to
our
first
writing
assignment,
I
went
into
great
depth.
I
found
the
work
of
Darwin's
theory
of
evolution
quite
difficult
to
understand,
yet
felt
a
firm
grasp
on
the
material.
I
conferred
with
classmates
and
their
paper's
seemed
somewhat
similar
to
mine.
I
was
especially
confident
when
I
met
with
my
Writing
Associate
and
she
seemed
to
echo
my
confidence
in
the
first
assignment.
There
are
certain
writing
assignments
and
exams
in
which
I
have
completed
with
uneasiness.
Any
student
can
relate
to
these
sentiments;
we
could
care
less
if
we
ever
found
out
what
the
grade
we
received
was.
Yet
there
are
other
assignments
and
exams,
ones
on
which
an
individual
works
with
extra
care
and
diligence,
where
the
outcome
is
greatly
anticipated.
This
first
writing
assignment
fits
into
the
latter
of
these
categories.
I
could
not
wait
to
see
what
my
professor
thought
of
my
paper,
and
I
was
sure
that
I
would
not
have
that
much
improvement
to
do
for
the
final
draft.
When
the
paper
did
come
back,
I
looked
at
the
first
page
with
some
degree
of
satisfaction.
Yet,
the
more
pages
I
flipped
the
more
and
more
my
stomach
dropped
to
the
floor.
On
the
concluding
page
of
the
paper,
there
were
several
comments
and
a
starting
grade
of
a
C+.
Although
I
was
not
thrilled
with
this
grade,
the
professor's
promise
that
grades
could
only
go
up
on
the
final
draft
continued
to
ring
through
my
head.
I
went
through
each
suggestion
my
professor
made
and
added
more
corrections
of
my
own.
I
had
done
everything
he
asked
me
to
and
more.
I
handed
the
paper
in
reassuring
myself
that
the
lowest
grade
possible
would
be
that
C+
and
there
was
no
way
I
could
have
worked
this
hard
to
stay
at
that
level.
On
the
day
in
which
the
final
draft
was
returned
to
the
class,
I
retreated
to
my
dorm
room
in
record
time
to
avoid
the
embarrassment
of
my
classmates
either
seeing
a
stream
of
tears
or
my
rage.
The
tears
came
through
first
as
I
sat
on
the
confines
of
my
bed
and
wondered
what
I
had
gotten
myself
into
by
attending
such
a
highly
ranked
liberal
arts
college.
Of
course
my
writing
was
not
going
to
be
up
to
par
by
Lafayette
standards.
I
was
ashamed
of
having
thought
that
I
could
contend
or
match
the
type
and
style
of
writing
that
my
professor
wanted.
I
stared
at
the
D+.
For
a
grade
that
could
not
have
gotten
lower
than
a
C+,
a
D+
was
obviously
not
what
I
expected.
As
soon
as
my
embarrassing
display
of
emotion
subsided,
I
wrote
an
email
to
my
professor
requesting
a
meeting.
His
excuse
for
my
grade
going
down
was
that
he
had
lost
my
first
draft;
he
could
not
remember
what
he
had
given
me
on
it
and
he
could
not
simply
go
on
my
word.
I
had
been
defeated,
but
met
with
him
again
and
again
in
attempts
to
do
better
on
the
second
paper.
These
efforts
raised
my
grade
to
the
C+
that
I
had
originally
received,
and
I
felt
crushed
in
every
sense
of
the
word.
The
first
thought
that
ran
through
my
head
was
that
this
professor
obviously
just
did
not
like
my
style
of
writing.
The
second
thought,
the
one
I
began
to
believe,
was
that
he
saw
promise
in
my
writing
and
that
he
was
simply
trying
to
challenge
me
to
expand
my
horizons.
When
I
received
my
grades
in
the
mail
however,
the
C-1
received
in
FYS
proved
that
I
did
not
possess
the
talents
my
professor
was
seeking.
I
was
mortified
and
completely
embarrassed
about
my
FYS
experience.
I
entered
English
110
with
the
thought
that
if
a
science
teacher
hated
my
writing,
there
was
no
way
an
English
teacher
would
be
impressed.
When
we
commenced
writing
in
English
110
however,
I
began
to
slowly
regain
the
confidence
that
Mrs.
Peabody
had
brought
out
in
me
so
long
ago.
My
English
110
professor
encouraged
my
writing
instead
of
highlighting
every
negative
aspect.
By
subtly
pointing
out
what
I
needed
to
change
in
my
writing
along
with
what
was
good,
she
made
me
want
to
change
the
weak
parts
of
an
assignment
into
the
same
level
as
the
strong
parts.
My
professor
also
encouraged
me
to
take
risks
with
my
writing,
a
concept
that
had
never
been
approached
in
my
compositions.
By
writing
about
the
most
personal
experience
of
my
life,
I
learned
that
exposing
and
writing
without
reservation
often
turns
into
my
best
work.
By
the
end
of
the
semester
I
was
correcting
other
classmates
work,
and
my
friends
were
asking
me
for
advice
on
writing.
When
my
English
110
professor
asked
if
I
would
consider
becoming
a
Writing
Associate,
I
balked
at
the
idea.
Yet
the
more
and
more
I
think
of
it,
there
were
clues
leading
up
to
this
point
my
entire
life.
As
I
stated
in
my
application
to
become
a
WA,
I
have
never
considered
myself
I
good
writer.
I
just
like
doing
it.
I
would
rather
write
five
ten-page
papers
than
take
a
exam.
I
also
know
from
Mrs.
Peabody
that
I
am
not
nearly
done
learning
all
there
is
to
know
about
writing.
Yet
if
I
think
of
that,
it
excites
me
to
know
that
at
some
point
I
could
love
writing
and
reading
more
than
I
do
right
now.
This
essay
is
on
the
history
of
my
writing,
a
history
that
has
expanded
only
close
to
nineteen
years.
This
is
not
a
history
yet.
I
am
not
going
to
conclude
this
paper
with
a
standard
conclusion,
because
I
simply
do
not
know
the
ending
yet.
Or
maybe
it
is
the
fact
that
conclusions
are
my
weak
point
and
I
am
trying
to
avoid
writing
one
for
this
essay.
I
guess,
much
like
writing,
it
all
depends
on
your
viewpoint.
