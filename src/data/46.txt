My
Literacy
Narrative
by
As
an
important
mean
of
communication,
good
writing
skills
are
essential
to
survive
in
today's
world.
Acquiring
them
is
a
process
that
starts
in
the
early
childhood,
and
continues
throughout
the
entire
life.
This
paper
presents
the
development
of
my
writing
skills,
starting
with
my
first
attempts
in
my
childhood
until
the
very
recent
experience
at
Lafayette
College.
My
first
writing
act
took
place
in
a
hospital
in
Czechoslovakia,
my
home
country.
At
that
time
I
was
about
four
or
five
years
old.
My
mother
took
me
there
for
a
growth-of-personality
examination.
All
children
of
my
age
were
supposed
to
participate
in
it.
The
actual
writing
act
was
very
simple,
and
was
intended
to
test
my
visual
skills.
I
was
supposed
to
copy
my
name.
It
turned
out
quite
successful
and
I
was
proud
of
my
accomplishment.
Formally
I
started
to
write
in
my
first
grade.
I
started
with
individual
letters
and
later
combined
them
into
words.
My
textbook
used
various
pictures
to
help
me
remember
the
letters
better.
I
remember
I
felt
very
proud
when
I
was
able
to
recognize
some
of
the
letters
in
newspapers,
posters
and
books.
During
the
second
and
third
grades,
my
syllabus
contained
spelling
classes,
during
which
I
used
to
copy
down
various
sentences
and
passages.
It
was
quite
a
challenge
to
copy
them
down
without
making
an
error.
Besides,
I
had
to
pay
attention
to
the
neatness
of
my
handwriting.
This
was
especially
hard,
since
the
standard
handwriting
in
Czechoslovakia
uses
various
calligraphic
embellishments
to
most
of
the
letters
of
the
alphabet.
I
wrote
my
first
narrative
essay
in
my
fourth
grade
and
it
dealt
with
my
trip
to
the
Tatra
Mountains.
It
was
supposed
to
be
one
page
long,
and
I
was
very
scared
of
writing
such
a
long
essay.
In
fact,
the
entire
class
was.
I
remember
that
after
a
few
sentences,
I
did
not
know
what
to
write,
since
I
thought
I
had
already
written
everything.
As
a
part
of
this
learning
process,
my
father
encouraged
me
to
read
various
books
and
they
became
one
of
my
most
favorite
hobbies.
I
read
them
whenever
I
had
free
time.
Even
at
night,
I
would
secretly
light
up
a
torch
under
my
blanket
to
read.
My
parents
did
not
like
this
idea,
since
they
claimed
that
I
should
spend
the
night
sleeping
rather
than
reading
a
book.
In
these
books
I
found
many
inspirations
for
my
narrative
writing.
In
the
fifth
grade,
I
faced
a
much
more
extensive
writing
program.
I
can
hardly
remember
what
all
the
essays
dealt
with,
but
I
remember
that
I
used
to
do
them
happily.
Writing
narrative
prose
attracted
me,
partly
because
I
enjoyed
my
writing
class,
and
partly
because
I
enjoyed
reading
books.
I
learnt
to
write
in
the
Slovak
language,
and
while
still
attending
an
elementary
school,
I
had
no
idea
about
the
existence
of
the
English
language
and
about
its
widespread
use.
I
began
to
learn
English
in
my
sixth
grade
at
a
local
language
school.
Although
I
barely
passed
the
first
two
years,
English
suddenly
became
my
hobby
number
one
and
remained
so
during
my
eight,
ninth
and
tenth
grades.
I
thought
studying
a
foreign
language
consisted
solely
of
grammar
and
vocabulary.
This
was
partly
due
to
some
flaws
in
the
educational
system
in
Czechoslovakia.
The
system
emphasized
memorizing
vocabulary
and
rules
of
grammar,
but
lacked
teaching
their
implementation.
This
fundamental
flaw
was
to
have
a
profound
influence
on
my
reading
and
writing
experience
later
on.
I
went
to
Wales
for
the
last
two
years
of
my
high
school
to
study
for
my
International
Baccalaureate
Diploma,
and
it
was
only
then
I
realized
that
I
had
not
yet
acquired
any
writing
or
reading
skills
in
English.
My
writing
lacked
structure,
clarity,
relevant
content,
and
variety
in
vocabulary.
For
my
first
writing
assignment,
I
had
to
write
about
my
freshman
camp.
I
ended
up
looking
up
most
of
the
words
in
a
dictionary,
a
very
painful
experience
indeed.
Moreover,
I
did
not
know
how
to
properly
use
the
words
I
looked
up.
As
a
result,
I
had
to
experiment
with
their
use.
Unfortunately,
this
experimentation
was
influenced
by
my
native
language,
and
many
of
the
expressions
I
coined
made
little
sense
to
a
native
English
speaker.
I
was
very
disappointed
when
my
English
professor
returned
my
essay
full
of
red
marks
and
comments.
After
this
experience
I
wrongly
concluded
that
my
writing
lacked
complexity,
and
I
started
to
construct
very
complicated
sentences.
However,
my
writing
completely
lost
clarity
and
I
was
again
disappointed
when
my
teacher
handed
my
essay
back.
Nevertheless,
I
learnt
from
this
experience,
and
I
decided
to
use
simple
sentences
instead
of
complicated
ones.
In
addition,
I
gave
up
experimenting
with
new
vocabulary
and
I
sticked
to
familiar,
yet
simple
words.
To
my
surprise,
I
started
to
receive
better
grades
for
my
papers
in
all
my
subjects.
While
working
toward
my
International
Baccalaureate
Diploma,
I
took
a
class
called
Theory
of
Knowledge
.
One
part
of
this
class
dealt
with
improving
writing.
We
were
judged
according
to
the
content,
clarity
and
critical
thought.
I
realized
that
these
qualities
were
essential
to
construct
a
good
argument.
In
addition,
I
realized
that
it
is
important
to
make
the
argument
flow
fluently
by
using
a
variety
of
auxiliary
words.
To
show
addition,
for
example,
one
should
use
words
such
as
also
,
in
addition
,
moreover
,
furthermore
,
and
so
on.
Such
words
make
the
paper
clearer
and
easier
to
read.
When
I
still
lived
in
Czechoslovakia,
I
learned
that
a
good
paper
should
have
an
introduction,
a
body
and
a
conclusion.
While
being
in
Britain,
I
learnt
more
about
the
structure
of
papers.
I
learnt
that
an
introduction
should
have
a
thesis,
which
outlines
the
argument,
that
a
body
should
contain
both
pro
and
contra
arguments,
and
that
a
conclusion
should
not
just
summarize
what
has
already
been
said,
but
also
give
some
implications.
During
my
first-year
seminar
and
the
VAST
course
at
Lafayette
College,
I
learn
much
more
about
writing
papers.
My
professors
handed
me
guidelines
for
narrative
and
technical
writing
and
I
follow
them
ever
since.
It
was
interesting
to
look
back
at
my
writing
experience.
However,
I
believe
that
I
must
continue
improving
my
writing
skills.
First
of
all,
I
am
planning
to
take
some
more
writing
courses,
and
to
work
as
a
Writing
Associate
for
the
English
Department
at
Lafayette
College.
Also,
I
will
keep
on
noticing
various
writing
stiles
while
reading
narrative
and
technical
literature.
I
hope
to
achieve
a
state
when
writing
will
became
for
me
as
natural
as
breathing.
