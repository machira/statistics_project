Literacy
Narrative
It
is
often
said
that
college
is
a
time
for
growth,
where
new
ideas
are
formed,
friendships
are
made,
and
the
experiences
of
the
classroom
are
applied
to
everyday
life.
Though
all
of
these
are
certainly
true,
an
oft
overlooked
maturity
also
comes
in
the
studentOs
capacity
as
a
writer,
as
he
is
exposed
to
a
plethora
of
fresh
writing
styles
and
techniques
that
expand
the
studentOs
repertoire
in
both
the
written
and
verbal
forms.
I
count
myself
lucky
in
this
regard,
as
through
my
experience
as
a
Writing
Associate
I
have
had
the
task
of
both
writing
my
own
papers
while
revising
and
making
suggestions
for
many
others.
This
has
invariably
helped
my
growth
as
a
writer,
as
I
have
been
exposed
to
a
variety
of
writing
styles
through
my
various
classes,
and
have
also
been
able
to
apply
my
time
as
a
Writing
Associate
and
apply
it
to
my
own
work.
My
first
semester
of
my
sophomore
year,
I
enrolled
in
two
classes
that
required
writing-
Introduction
to
Sociology
and
American
Literature
II.
Introduction
to
Sociology
proved
to
be
an
interesting
class,
as
it
was
my
first
foray
into
the
subject.
However,
although
the
topic
was
enjoyable,
I
met
the
writing
assignments
with
mixed
results.
Many
of
the
assignments
were
simply
responses
to
articles
we
had
read,
and
seemed
to
be
little
more
than
a
check-up
to
make
sure
the
students
kept
up
on
the
reading.
While
this
may
have
served
a
practical
purpose,
I
often
found
the
task
dull
and
unrewarding.
Although
these
assignments
may
have
been
tedious,
the
main
essay
for
the
class
proved
to
be
a
much
more
satisfying
venture.
The
topic
was
extremely
open
ended-
nearly
any
subject
could
be
chosen,
as
long
as
it
could
relate
back
to
sociological
topics
discussed
in
the
class.
This
allowed
me
to
combine
my
most
enjoyed
subject
at
Lafayette-
economics-
with
the
various
sociological
terms
and
ideas
I
had
learned
over
the
course
of
the
semester.
To
this
end,
I
chose
the
topic
of
globalization,
and
more
specifically
how
it
affects
peopleOs
lives,
as
the
main
thesis
for
my
paper.
Though
the
research
took
longer
than
I
would
have
liked,
I
found
myself
thoroughly
enjoying
the
process.
The
paper
came
out
fairly
well,
and
assuredly
much
better
than
if
I
had
been
forced
to
write
about
another
topic.
The
experience
taught
me,
although
it
already
should
have
been
rather
obvious,
that
writing
about
an
interest
is
ultimately
much
more
rewarding
than
something
I
find
dull.
It
made
me
realize
that
if
I
can
find
creative
ways
to
work
my
own
interests
into
assigned
papers,
the
end
product
will
invariably
be
better
than
if
I
take
the
more
mindless,
boring
path.
My
other
writing
class
during
first
semester
was
American
Literature
II.
Unlike
my
Sociology
class,
which
I
had
never
taken
before,
this
class
had
a
more
typical
NEnglish
classO
style
structure
and
dealt
with
topics
that
I
was
familiar
with.
Much
of
the
class
was
discussion
based,
as
the
professor
would
issue
prompts
before
each
class
to
spur
the
studentsO
thought
process
on
the
novels
and
short
stories.
These
were
ultimately
helpful
as
both
starting
points
for
class
discussions
and
study
guides
for
the
two
exams
over
the
course
of
the
semester.
As
the
class
was
not
designated
a
NwritingO
class,
the
assigned
writing
was
often
shorter
and
less
thought-provoking
than
other
classes.
The
class
did
not
seem
to
step
outside
the
bounds
of
conventional
English
classes,
and
thus
the
writing
felt
like
a
repeat
of
things
I
had
done
before.
The
assignments
consisted
of
either
three
page
essays,
which
were
short
responses
to
a
particular
point
in
the
novel,
or
a
brief
in-class
piece
to
make
sure
we
kept
up
on
the
reading.
The
writing,
at
least
for
me,
felt
bland
and
unimaginative.
I
felt
that
my
progression
as
a
writer
was
minimal,
as
the
questions
posed
did
not
seem
to
expand
on
anything
I
had
learned
before,
but
merely
repeat
the
process.
The
in-class
paragraphs
were
mainly
just
used
as
a
check-up,
and
the
short
essays
seemed
to
be
a
rehashing
of
material
already
discussed
in
class.
While
I
ultimately
enjoyed
the
class
because
of
the
stimulating
discussions
and
the
intimate
feel
of
the
small-classroom
setting,
my
writing
prowess
seemed
to
remain
stagnant.
In
the
midst
of
taking
these
two
classes,
I
was
also
encountering
a
whole
new
side
of
writing
during
my
first
WA
experience.
After
having
been
chosen
to
be
a
WA
for
the
fall
semester,
I
was
assigned
to
my
old
FYS,
HitlerOs
Third
Reich,
which
came
as
somewhat
of
a
relief.
I
was
fairly
nervous
about
the
whole
thing,
mainly
because
I
found
it
a
little
odd
to
be
giving
advice
and
critiquing
students
whom
I
considered
peers,
and
were
only
a
year
younger.
However,
my
fears
were
somewhat
allayed
by
the
fact
that
I
already
knew
both
the
material
and
the
professor
of
the
class,
which
would
hopefully
make
my
job
easier.
My
first
few
meetings
were
a
little
nerve-wracking,
and
I
probably
ended
up
being
just
as
awkward
as
the
freshman
sitting
in
front
of
me.
However,
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
as
my
first
set
of
meetings
progressed
I
began
to
feel
more
and
more
comfortable
with
my
role.
One
of
the
main
contributors
to
this
was
simply
practice.
As
the
old
adage
goes,
practice
makes
perfect,
and
I
found
my
ability
to
effectively
NWAO
a
paper
advanced
as
the
number
of
meetings
increased.
I
began
to
fall
into
a
routine,
which
enabled
me
to
easily
identify
reoccurring
problems
in
many
of
the
papers.
Furthermore,
I
was
aided
by
the
similarity
of
the
essays.
Though
it
may
become
a
little
dull
and
repetitive
to
read
16
essays
on
the
same
topic,
my
familiarity
with
the
source
material
allowed
me
to
sift
through
the
paper
with
a
degree
of
ease
I
had
previously
lacked.
My
first
semester
as
a
WA
also
demonstrated
to
me
how
far
I
have
to
go
as
a
writer,
and
how
much
I
can
learn
from
other
studentsO
works.
There
were
2-3
students
in
the
FYS
who
were,
frankly,
better
writers
than
I
was.
It
was
a
humbling
experience
to
have
to
review
and
edit
a
paper
written
by
a
student
whose
writing
expertise
seemed
to
surpass
mine.
While
I
believed
that
I
could
still
offer
some
insight
and
guidance
in
regards
to
paper
improvement,
it
was
a
reinforcement
that
the
NWAO
meetings
are
supposed
to
be
a
cooperative
affair,
and
not
a
purely
instructional
meeting.
During
my
second
semester
of
my
sophomore
year,
I
took
three
classes
that
in
some
form
or
another
had
a
writing
element
in
the
curriculum.
The
first
of
these
was
my
VAST
class,
called
NThe
Rise
of
Industrial
America.O
While
I
enjoyed
the
class
as
a
whole,
it
also
proved
to
be
one
of
my
most
frustrating
academic
experiences.
The
class
was
assigned
three
essays,
along
with
shorter
writing
assignments
to
force
diligence
with
the
readings.
The
workload
itself
was
not
overly
difficult,
but
my
frustrations
grew
from
my
grades
in
the
class.
While
not
doing
poorly,
I
could
not
seem
to
reach
the
NAO
standard,
no
matter
how
much
feedback
I
tried
to
obtain.
I
could
not
find
anything
particularly
wrong
with
my
writing,
or
any
substantial
changes
necessary
to
boost
my
grade.
It
was
frustrating
to
say
the
least,
but
I
believed
the
experience
taught
me
something
I
could
relate
to
my
WA
work.
Our
goal
as
WAs,
for
sure,
is
not
necessarily
to
boost
the
studentsO
grade,
but
rather
help
them
write
a
better
paper.
However,
if
I
can
push
the
student
in
a
direction
that
will
both
enhance
their
paper
and
add
components
that
the
professor
may
look
favorably
upon,
I
should
certainly
do
so.
My
second
writing
class
of
the
semester
was
Econometrics.
While
not
a
writing
class
in
the
conventional
sense,
two
papers
were
assigned
based
on
a
semester-long
project.
The
topic
I
decided
to
work
on
with
my
partner
was
NWhat
determines
an
NFL
teamOs
chance
of
making
the
playoffs,O
as
we
investigated
the
various
factors
that
spur
a
teamOs
success.
What
made
these
assignments
unique
were
their
predefined
structure
as
given
to
us
by
the
professor.
Unlike
an
English
essay,
where
the
form
and
content
are
sometimes
up
for
debate,
the
class
was
given
very
distinct
guidelines
on
the
form
of
the
papers.
This
prescribed
form
seemed
to
take
away
from
the
creativity
of
writing
the
essay,
mainly
because
it
left
little
room
for
interpretation.
Most
of
the
sections
we
were
asked
to
write
were
basically
a
rehashing
of
a
sample
essay
we
had
received,
except
with
the
substitution
of
our
data
for
the
sampleOs
data.
The
form
of
the
essay
was
certainly
not
up
for
debate,
as
sections
like
NIntroductionO
and
NBackgroundO
could
not
be
left
out.
However,
even
the
writing
inside
these
sections
was
more
or
less
already
defined
for
us,
which
made
writing
most
of
the
essays
easy
but
tedious.
The
one
section
that
was
left
open
for
interpretation,
and
the
one
I
enjoyed
writing
the
most,
was
the
NAnalysisO
section.
While
certain
points
still
needed
to
be
addressed,
this
was
the
topic
where
I
felt
I
could
most
combine
my
love
of
Economics
and
English
to
form
a
creative,
well-written
piece.
I
found
the
writing
came
easier
when
I
was
able
to
mesh
my
own
thoughts
on
our
topic
with
previous
research
and
data.
My
partner
and
I
ended
up
being
extremely
pleased
with
our
end
product,
with
the
highlight
of
our
essay
being
the
Analysis
section.
My
third
and
final
writing
class
of
the
semester
was
Contemporary
Fiction.
This
class
was
also
not
listed
as
NwritingO
class
by
the
school,
and
as
such
the
actual
writing
component
was
reduced
to
two
in-class
examinations.
These
examinations
were
fairly
straightforward
as
exams
go,
and
so
my
writing
did
not
progress
all
that
much
in
that
regard.
What
was
rewarding,
however,
was
the
material
we
were
assigned
to
read
in
class.
Fiction
has
always
been
my
favorite
genre
of
English,
and
so
I
found
myself
enjoying
the
readings.
They
were
incredibly
varied,
drawing
from
authors
from
all
different
backgrounds
and
perspectives.
This
variety
gave
me
not
only
enormous
insight
into
numerous
societies,
but
also
very
diverse
writing
styles.
I
not
only
gained
an
appreciation
for
the
new
techniques
I
learned,
but
hopefully
with
practice
will
be
able
to
implement
them
into
my
own
writing.
Although
my
classes
during
my
second
semester
were
very
instructive,
I
also
benefitted
from
my
time
as
a
WA.
Unlike
my
first
semester,
this
semester
I
was
assigned
to
an
economics
writing
class,
termed
Women
&
the
Economy.
While
I
felt
more
comfortable
with
the
subject
than
in
my
previous
class,
the
new
wrinkle
was
that
I
would
be
advising
juniors
and
seniors,
rather
than
the
freshmen
I
was
accustomed
to.
This
made
me
nervous
all
over
again,
because
I
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
from
upperclassmen
who
most
likely
would
not
want
to
be
there.
My
fears
were
somewhat
assuaged,
however,
by
the
laid
back
attitude
of
the
professor,
Professor
Averett.
Her
flexibility
on
timelines
and
easy-going
nature
made
my
transition
to
an
upper-level
class
much
easier.
Also,
for
the
first
three
assignments
she
sorted
the
class
into
groups,
which
gave
me
more
time
to
review
and
prepare
for
each
paper.
After
my
experience
as
a
WA
for
the
class,
I
certainly
met
mixed
results
from
the
students.
As
in
any
class,
there
were
students
who
seemed
to
genuinely
care
about
their
work
and
earnestly
worked
towards
earning
a
better
grade.
These
students
were
enjoyable
to
work
with,
because
we
were
able
to
collaborate
to
help
them
write
a
better
paper.
Many
of
the
other
students,
however,
simply
did
not
care.
It
was
a
minor
miracle
if
everyone
showed
up
for
their
meetings,
and
more
often
than
not
about
4-5
students
simply
did
not
even
schedule
meetings,
never
mind
attend.
For
these
students,
it
was
harder
to
prepare
for
the
meetings,
because
I
never
knew
if
they
would
even
show
up.
I
found
that
when
it
was
explicitly
obvious
a
student
does
not
care
about
their
work,
it
was
also
more
difficult
more
to
me
to
put
my
full
effort
into
the
project.
Although
I
strived
to
always
give
my
best
to
the
student,
there
were
certainly
times
when
it
was
hard
to
find
the
motivation
to
prepare
for
the
meetings.
Overall,
I
found
my
sophomore
year
to
be
very
illuminating
in
regards
to
my
writing.
I
found
myself
exposed
to
a
variety
of
topics
spanning
cultures
and
generations.
My
classes
were
very
instructive,
and
while
the
writing
itself
may
have
occasionally
been
dull,
my
exposure
to
a
lot
of
topics
aided
my
writing
perspective
and
techniques.
I
found
myself
enjoying
many
of
the
challenges
thrown
my
way,
whether
they
be
writing
a
research
paper
for
an
economics
class
or
book
analysis
for
english.
With
the
plethora
of
writing
based
classes
I
was
taking
my
writing
ability
could
not
help
but
grow
as
the
school
year
progressed.
My
work
as
a
WA
also
aided
my
maturation
as
a
writer.
I
found
myself
learning
new
things
from
the
students
I
was
advising,
and
our
work
turned
into
a
truly
collaborative
effort.
While
many
students
obviously
did
not
want
to
be
there,
the
ones
who
did
made
my
WA
work
easy
and
enjoyable.
The
professors
I
worked
with
also
made
my
job
enjoyable,
as
they
were
flexible
and
very
supportive
of
my
work.
In
the
end,
I
really
enjoyed
my
experience
as
a
WA
over
the
course
of
the
year,
and
would
recommend
it
to
many
friend
who
was
considering
submitting
an
application.
