LITERARY
NARRATIVE:
THE
STORY
OF
A
WRITER
"Writing
is
a
process"
it
is
said.
Indeed,
to
achieve
a
remarkable
final
product,
such
as
a
strong
paper,
the
human
mind
has
developed
a
systematic
method
that
is
capable
of
making
the
most
unsuitable
individual
create
a
strong
piece
of
writing.
A
time-consuming
process
that
goes
through
brainstorming,
outlining,
drafting,
drafting
again,
editing,
polishing,
and
drafting
once
more,
can
indeed
yield
an
outstanding
product,
and
with
it,
great
satisfaction.
However,
there
is
an
even
more
rewarding
writing
process:
that
which
the
writer
does
not
develop,
but
actually
develops
a
writer;
one
that
is
so
complex
as
the
identity
of
a
person;
and
one
that
is
so
complete,
it
lasts
a
lifetime.
That
is
the
process
of
learning
how
to
write.
Certainly,
it
would
be
no
coincidence
if
the
first
person
to
say
"Every
expert
was
once
a
beginner"
were
a
writer.
As
a
beginner,
elementary
school
was
the
crib
for
my
writing
skills.
My
first
written
report
was
assigned
in
third
grade.
It
was
an
explanatory
report
that
would
narrate,
in
one
page,
the
nature
of
the
cardinal
bird's
lifespan
and
participation
in
the
ecosystem
of
its
habitat.
I
remember
it
was
the
first
time
I
felt
in
conflict
with
myself
as
a
writer.
For
the
first
time,
I
was
actually
concerned
about
the
details
of
my
paper,
encountering
difficulties
choosing
a
word,
deciding
upon
a
sentence
structure,
or
questioning
the
style
(more
than
the
content)
of
my
writing.
Feeling
insecure
of
my
performance
as
a
writer,
I
decided
to
take
sentence
by
sentence
from
the
encyclopedia
and
rewrite
it
in
my
own
words.
That
way,
I
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
the
coherence
of
my
paper,
the
order
of
the
ideas
or
the
validity
of
the
content.
I
just
translated
the
information,
from
a
language
that
I
would
only
see
in
books
to
the
language
we
regularly
spoke
in
our
class
of
8
year
olds.
I
did
not,
however,
remain
as
an
8
year
old
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
In
fact,
together
with
the
early
puberty
that
I
had,
came
a
precocious
intellectual
maturity
that
claimed
a
greater
dedication
to
the
development
of
my
writing
skills.
For
the
next
three
years,
I
explored
the
different
branches
of
literature
and
examined
closely
the
diverse
forms
of
writing.
I
learned
to
appreciate
the
beauty
of
certain
words,
and
the
awkwardness
of
others,
when
put
together.
I
acquired
and
developed
a
taste
for
words
according
to
my
style.
I
was
experiencing
the
art
of
word
choice.
And,
because
almost
everything
in
this
life
is
done
in
the
name
of
experience,
I
decided
to
take
the
7
grade
English
course
with
the
toughest
teacher
in
Middle
School.
Mrs.
Lee
was
a
lady
that
almost
never
smiled
and
who
was
never
satisfied
by
the
performance
of
her
students;
the
teacher
who
never
gave
"A"s.
But
the
day
after
we
turned
in
our
first
written
assignment
was
the
first
day,
in
the
history
of
her
career
as
a
teacher,
that
she
didn't
even
grade
her
students'
papers.
They
all
had
to
be
rewritten.
With
an
upset
look
that
disappointed
us,
she
assigned
us
to
read
out
loud
one
of
the
paragraphs
of
the
essay
she
had
just
displayed
on
the
overhead
projector.
Evidently,
the
short
sample
essay
impressed
us
all.
We
all
noticed
it
had
what
none
of
our
papers
had;
it
immediately
grabbed
the
reader's
attention,
and
had
the
power
to
conduct
him/her
so
smoothly
through
out
the
paper,
that
such
attention
was
never
lost.
As
beginners,
we
couldn't
identify
what
the
actual
secret
was.
Until
Mrs.
Lee
explained
to
us,
through
a
detailed
process
of
analyzing
each
sentence,
what
organization,
structuring,
and
linkage
of
ideas
are.
The
day
she
smiled
because
of
the
quality
of
my
work
and
gave
me
an
A
for
the
course
was
the
last
day
I
saw
her.
It
was
then
that
I
decided
to
pursuit
with
diligence
a
talent
I
had
developed.
As
I
intended
my
best
to
enrich
my
vocabulary
and
make
my
writing
sound
more
complex,
I
fell
into
the
trap
of
flowery
writing.
All
my
essays
were
like
poems
because
each
sentence
resembled
a
quotation!
The
high
analytical
content
of
my
works
was
"hampered"
(this
is
the
exact
word
my
9th
grade
English
teacher
wrote
on
the
upper
left
hand
comer
of
my
first
essay)
by
the
language
I
used.
The
problem
was,
however,
that
I
was
not
able
to
recognize
the
mistakes;
to
my
appreciation,
the
essay
could
not
be
any
better.
It
was
then
that
I
concluded
that
my
problem,
to
a
certain
extent,
was
the
fact
that
English
was
not
my
first
language.
Spanish
is
a
language
very
different
from
English.
It
is
a
language
in
which
the
syntax
is
complex,
the
vocabulary
is
extremely
rich,
and
in
which
including
two
or
more
ideas
in
one
sentence
is
considered
an
art
rather
than
a
flaw.
Trying
to
apply
these
characteristics
into
my
English
writing
made
my
works
completely
incomprehensive
to
others.
Although
my
teachers
would
appreciate
the
ideas
I
presented
and
the
effort
I
made
to
present
them
the
best
way
possible,
they
were
not
too
happy
with
my
style.
The
problem
was
that
I
was.
In
an
attempt
to
make
my
vocabulary
more
simple
and
my
essays
more
fluent,
I
decided
to
explore
the
discipline
of
Debate.
In
Debate
I
was
expected
to
deliver
impromptu
speeches
of
eight
to
ten
minutes
without
stopping,
making
coherent
sense,
and
using
the
appropriate
words.
Indeed,
I
was
forced
to
think
fast
and
express
myself
in
a
simple
clear
manner
that
would
be
appealing
to
the
audience
and
the
judges.
Debate
became
one
of
my
passions.
I
was
part
of
the
World's
School
Debate
Championship
team,
competing
locally
and
internationally.
In
fact,
my
communication
skills
had
greatly
improved.
Now
it
was
a
matter
of
applying
some
of
those
skills
to
my
written
form
of
expression.
Tenth
grade
was
the
grade
in
which
I
honestly
tried
to
simplify
my
language.
I
would
try
to
write
an
essay
the
way
I
deliver
a
speech.
Although,
to
me,
the
style
of
the
essay
seemed
quite
simplistic
and
more
superficial
than
before,
I
was
sure
it
was
understandable.
However,
that
was
not
enough.
I
felt
my
works
were
not
satisfactory
and
that
I
was
not
performing
to
the
best
of
my
potential.
My
work
seemed
quite
mediocre,
and
not
content
with
this
new
style,
I
unconsciously
readopted
my
original,
thorough
but
incomprehensive,
way
of
writing.
Then
came
the
course
that
would
forge
my
writing
skills
the
way
hammers
forge
metals.
As
a
requisite
of
the
International
Baccalaureate
Diploma,
I
took
the
TOK
course.
Theory
of
Knowledge
was
an
integral
class
that
made
the
students
explore
areas
of
knowledge
necessary
for
a
logical
thought
process
and
its
accurate
expression.
It
incorporated
subjects
like
psychology,
theology,
philosophy
and
logic
among
others.
The
topics
included
in
the
course
triggered
new
ideas
and
questions
that,
in
a
written
form,
sought
for
answers
or
explanations.
I
will
never
forget
the
first
TOK
assignment.
The
title
was
"Who
am
I
and
how
do
I
know
that's
who
I
am".
Of
course,
I
wrote
a
paper
with
the
poetic
style
I
was
so
well
known
for.
I
felt
I
was
truly
expressing
myself,
but
in
fact,
I
was
not
getting
the
content
across.
It
is
enough
to
say,
that
in
a
grading
system
between
zero
and
fifteen,
being
the
latter
an
A+,
I
was
the
only
one
in
the
class
to
get
an
"R"
standing
for
"Redo".
Mrs.
Boyd
had
already
warned
us
that
our
grades
at
the
beginning
would
not
be
very
high,
and
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
get
a
15,
but
she
never
mentioned
the
possibility
of
an
"R".
In
every
paper,
she
would
question
the
meaning
of
the
sentences
and
words
I
emplyed.
"What
do
you
mean
by
'essence
'?"
"What
do
you
mean
by
'reality
'?"
"What
do
you
mean
by
'right
7"
Indeed,
these
questions
made
me
search
for
logical
explanations
to
things
(right
now
she
would
have
asked
"what
do
you
mean
by
'things
'???)
that,
to
me,
were
evident.
Little
by
little,
I
got
used
to
the
technicality
of
her
questions
and
actually
appreciated
her
observations.
With
constant
diligence
(and
frustration)
I
learned
to
use
the
correct
words
to
express
myself;
I
learned
to
think
not
only
with
a
thesis
in
mind,
but
with
a
counter
thesis
that
would
give
more
validity
to
my
point;
I
learned
to
show
an
awareness
for
opposing
ideas,
and
to
defend
my
argument
with
articulate
vocabulary.
Indeed,
this
class
was
one
of
the
hardest
courses
I
had
every
taken,
but
it
showed
me
a
new
dimension
in
the
art
of
writing.
In
my
12
grade
History
class
I
practiced,
intensely
what
I
had
learned
as
a
Junior.
Our
fast-paced,
demanding,
and
very
good
looking,
teacher,
Mr.
Cannon,
assigned,
on
average,
two
essays
a
week.
Furthermore,
he
expected
us
to
write
about
5
pages
per
essay,
including
quotations,
dates,
analysis,
historiography
and
employ
no
more
than
an
hour
for
each
essay.
All
this
was
in
preparation
for
the
IB
(International
Baccalaureate)
Exams,
in
which
we
are
asked
to
write
three
essays
in
150
minutes.
In
conjunction
with
the
English
teacher,
who
was
also
preparing
us
for
the
IB
English
exam,
I
learned
to
write
my
essays
without
stopping.
I
learned
to
focus
on
a
clear
train
of
thought
that
would
guide
the
reader
throughout
the
paper
without
difficulty.
I
learned
to
organize
my
ideas
quickly
and
to
have
an
eloquent
style
almost
naturally.
Today,
all
my
efforts
are
recognized.
I
came
to
college
expecting
an
even
tougher
preparation
for
the
outside
world;
a
writing
course
that
would
further
forge
my
writing.
Indeed,
my
FYS
class,
the
only
writing
course
I
have
taken
in
college
so
far,
polished
some
of
the
expressions
that
I
still
tend
to
translate
from
Spanish
to
English.
However,
I
demonstrated
strong
writing
skills
that
helped
me
perform
at
a
level
above
the
expectations
of
the
professor.
Furthermore,
this
year
I
will
be
a
Writing
Associate,
probably
one
of
the
most
demanding
occupations
for
Lafayette
students,
and
through
this
program,
I
intend
to
share
what
I
learned
a
couple
of
years
ago,
and
to
learn
what
other
writers
would
like
to
share
with
me.
Ten
years
after
that
first
written
report
I
did
on
the
Cardinal
Bird,
I
still
see
myself
interested
in
further
developing
strong
writing
skills.
I
still
struggle
not
to
incorporate
Spanish
techniques
into
my
English
writing.
And
although
after
exploring
different
dimensions
of
the
English
language
and
experiencing
constant
difficulties
I
still
struggle
to
restrains
my
"flower-ic"
tendencies
I
know
I
have
grown
as
a
writer.
My
selfexpectations
(such
as
being
a
WA)
are
higher
at
this
point
than
ten
years
ago.
Indeed,
I
used
to
be
satisfied
with
imitating
the
language
I
could
only
find
in
books.
Today,
my
dream
is
to
be
the
author
of
one,
and
inspire
a
young
writer
the
way
an
author
once
inspired
me.
