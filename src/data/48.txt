A
Literary
History
I
was
quite
intimidated
when
I
first
read
the
requirements
for
this
written
assignment.
The
only
memories
of
writing
that
I
was
immediately
able
to
recall
were
college
experiences.
I
will
get
into
that
later.
Upon
deeper
consideration
though,
vague
recollections
of
earlier
writing
experiences
slowly
drifted
into
my
mind.
The
first
act
of
writing
that
I
can
recall
was
the
summer
before
I
entered
the
fifth
grade.
I
was
transferring
from
a
public
school
to
a
parochial
school.
A
requirement
for
this
transfer
was
to
do
a
number
of
book
reports.
This
memory
stands
out
in
my
mind
because
of
the
challenge
I
unknowingly
created
for
myself.
I
don't
know
why,
but
two
of
the
books
I
selected
for
the
book
reports
were
Tom
Sawyer
and
The
Hound
of
the
Baskervilles.
Having
little
experience
reading
challenging
texts
and
even
less
experience
writing
about
them,
I
had
clearly
bitten
off
more
that
I
could
chew.
However,
I
pressed
on
and
somehow
managed
to
throw
together
a
written
piece
of
work.
Each
book
report
couldn't
have
been
more
than
three
handwritten
pages
long.
Furthermore,
I'm
relatively
sure
that
I
didn't
make
too
much
of
an
effort
to
write
small.
I
think
that
at
that
stage
in
my
life,
the
only
concern
I
had
when
doing
written
reports
was
to
get
it
done
with
the
least
effort
possible.
I
was
able
to
rely
on
natural
ability
and
still
get
by
with
good
grades.
I
basically
followed
the
outline
of
how
to
write
a
book
report,
an
outline
given
to
me
by
the
teacher.
I'm
sure
that
I
didn't
write
very
good
reports
in
that
summer
of
1984.
What
fifth
grader
knows
what
constitutes
good
writing
anyway?
I'd
have
trouble
writing
good
reports
if
I
were
given
those
novels
to
reread
today.
My
next
significant
writing
experience
occurred
in
junior
high
school
In
seventh
and
eighth
grades,
I
wrote
a
number
of
book
reports.
The
outline
for
the
reports
basically
remained
unchanged
from
fifth
grade.
I'd
have
to
guess
that
though
I
may
have
become
a
more
sophisticated
writer
by
that
time,
I
was
not
necessarily
a
better
one.
The
one
book
that
stands
out
in
my
mind
is
The
Outsiders.
At
this
point
in
my
life,
I
think
that
I
had
supreme
confidence
in
myself
as
a
writer
-
a
confidence
that
seems
unwarranted
in
hindsight.
Looking
back,
I
think
that
I
was
a
really
bad
writer.
The
only
part
of
the
whole
writing
process
that
I
really
enjoyed
and
took
pride
in
came
after
the
final
draft
was
written.
This
is
the
point
that
I
got
to
type
up
my
report
on
my
sister's
new
typewriter.
To
press
down
on
those
small
square
keys
and
hear
the
clean
tk
tk
tk
was
heaven.
Though
typing
the
report
often
took
longer
than
the
whole
writing
process,
I
thoroughly
cherished
it.
I
think
that
a
well-typed,
visually-pleasing
report
was
a
higher
priority
to
me
than
a
well-written,
quality
work.
Of
course,
I
don't
think
that
I
knew
what
a
quality
work
was
at
the
time.
My
next
memory
of
writing
was
in
my
freshman
year
of
high
school.
The
assignment
given
to
the
class
by
my
English
teacher
was
to
write
a
fictional
short
story
on
any
topic.
I
had
never
been
given
a
writing
assignment
of
this
magnitude
before.
To
say
the
very
least,
I
was
scared
out
of
my
wits.
As
in
junior
high
school,
I
didn't
write
what
I
thought
was
q
high
quality
paper.
All
I
was
concerned
about
was
getting
the
assignment
in
on
time.
I
came
up
with
a
simplistic
and
dated
plot.
The
main
character,
a
male
high
school
student,
was
a
third
string
wide
receiver
on
the
school
team.
By
some
twist
of
fate,
he
is
put
into
the
game
for
the
critical
last
play.
He
somehow
makes
the
touchdown
catch
to
win
the
game.
The
Monday
following
the
game,
he
becomes
the
cool
guy
in
school.
He
allows
this
to
go
to
his
head
and
turns
his
back
on
his
old
friends.
Predictably,
he
is
put
into
the
same
situation
in
the
next
game,
and
fails
to
repeat
his
first
feat.
The
crowd
turn
their
backs
to
him
and
he
is
left
alone
on
the
field.
I
eloquently
entitled
this
epic
story
Football
Failure.
I
never
fooled
myself
into
thinking
that
this
short
story
was
prize-winning
material.
I
felt
that
I
was
capable
of
a
much
more
complex
and
worthy
storyline.
This
was
an
opportunity
for
me
to
challenge
myself,
to
attempt
to
accomplish
what
I
thought
I
could
as
a
writer.
I
guess
that
I
either
didn't
want
to
challenge
myself
or
was
afraid
to.
If
I
had
challenged
myself,
the
course
of
my
high
school
career
could
have
been
quite
different
and
much
more
rich.
My
next
significant
writing
experience
occurred
in
my
sophomore
year
of
high
school.
The
chaplain
of
my
Jesuit
high
school
ran
a
strong
retreat
program.
All
students
in
my
school
go
on
a
retreat
called
Quest
in
the
their
sophomore
year.
During
the
retreat,
students
are
surprised
with
a
stack
of
letters
from
family
and
teachers
expressing
care
and
love.
This,
according
to
almost
all
those
who
take
part,
is
one
of
the
best
experiences
of
the
retreat.
For
those
who
go
on
the
earlier
retreats,
this
provides
the
opportunity
to
write
letters
to
friends
who
go
on
later
retreats.
Some
of
my
closest
friends
went
on
the
last
Quest.
I
decided
to
seize
the
opportunity.
Guys
being
guys,
however,
did
not
write
phrases
like
I
love
you
or
I
care
about
you
to
other
males.
Such
was
the
case
for
me.
I
wrote
very
informal
but
quite
lengthy
letters
to
my
friends
going
on
Quest.
Though
I
never
expressed
it
in
words,
the
message
of
the
letters
was
that
I
truly
valued
their
friendships.
This
was
probably
my
first
experience
in
totally
free
writing,
and
I
really
enjoyed
it.
It
was
the
first
opportunity
in
which
my
personality
came
through
in
my
writing.
I
filled
the
letters
with
jokes
(most
of
which
were
probably
not
funny)
and
let
my
actions
(that
being
the
actual
letter
writing)
express
my
affection.
In
my
junior
year
of
high
school,
I
went
on
another
chaplain-run
retreat
called
Emmaus.
At
the
beginning
of
Emmaus,
each
student
is
given
a
notebook.
This
notebook
becomes
a
vital
part
of
many
exercises
in
the
retreat.
On
Emmaus,
I
first
experienced
the
feeling
of
writing
for
nobody
but
myself.
The
things
that
I
wrote
in
that
green
and
white
notebook
were
meant
for
my
eyes
only.
Though
I
didn't
have
to,
I
completely
opened
my
mind
and
my
heart
to
that
notebook.
During
what
I
would
call
a
difficult
period
of
my
life,
writing
my
thoughts
and
feelings
on
those
pages
served
as
therapeutic
sessions.
I
still
have
those
notebooks,
and
I
look
through
them
every
once
in
a
while
to
get
a
good
laugh.
Thinking
back,
my
problems
were
not
all
that
bad.
But
of
course,
I
was
a
teen-ager
and
considered
the
zit
on
my
nose
a
world-ending
problem.
However,
I
do
remember
how
I
felt
back
then
and
can
fully
appreciate
how
much
that
notebook
helped
me.
I
came
to
college
with
the
immutable
idea
that
papers
should
be
written
in
the
universally
known
hourglass
or
funnel
model,
the
only
method
I
knew
of
writing
a
paper.
Fortunately,
my
professor
for
Literary
Questions
did
not
share
my
belief.
Our
first
writing
assignment
for
the
class
was
to
write
a
paper
about
some
significant
aspect
of
the
novel
White
Hotel.
I
had
my
usually
difficult
time
deciding
on
some
topic
I
considered
worthy
of
a
paper.
Once
I
made
my
decision,
I
waited
as
I
usually
did
until
the
very
last
day
to
write
the
paper.
Unlike
my
methods
through
high
school,
I
began
to
write
my
papers
on
a
word
processor.
I
sat
down
at
my
desk
and
started
to
punch
away
at
the
keys.
One
thought
flowed
into
another
and
all
I
had
to
do
was
form
these
thoughts
into
grammatically
correct
sentences.
Every
once
in
a
while
I
went
back
and
edited
previous
sentences
to
make
them
sound
better.
I
wasn't
about
to
question
whether
my
thoughts
made
sense,
though.
In
fact,
I
think
that
most
changes
I
made
were
due
to
modifications
in
ideas.
Very
little
planning
went
into
my
writing,
and
it
must
have
been
very
obvious.
I
handed
in
the
paper
thinking
that
though
it
was
not
an
exceptional
piece
of
writing,
I
was
not
capable
of
bombing
on
a
paper.
Well,
I
did.
My
only
salvation
was
that
most
of
the
other
students
in
the
class
bombed
as
well.
Our
professor
must
have
been
thoroughly
disgusted
and
disappointed.
I
don't
think
that
she
expected
so
many
of
us
to
do
so
poorly.
The
syllabus
of
the
class
was
totally
altered
as
a
result.
This
paper
on
White
Hotel
became
a
huge
writing
project
taking
up
a
quarter
of
the
semester.
We
wrote
draft
after
draft,
receiving
feedback
from
the
professor
as
well
as
classmates.
These
four
weeks
(+
or
-
1)
were
by
far
the
most
influential
experiences
of
my
writing
career.
By
getting
feedback
during
the
writing
process,
I
learned
to
question
the
logical
flow
of
my
thoughts.
I
learned
to
put
myself
in
the
place
of
the
reader
and
tailor
my
writing
so
that
someone
besides
myself
could
understand.
Though
I
still
had
a
long
way
to
go
to
become
a
good
writer,
I
had
taken
my
first
wobbly
steps.
Later
on
in
the
semester,
the
same
professor
gave
us
a
poetry
assignment.
We
were
to
write
a
sonnet
on
any
topic
of
our
choice.
This
still
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
assignments
I've
ever
had.
There
were
many
reasons
for
this.
Up
until
this
time,
my
only
experience
writing
poetry
was
in
grammar
school
when
I
wrote
simplistic
haikus.
I
didn't
like
poetry,
and
I
planned
on
avoiding
poetry
as
much
as
possible.
Also,
I
didn't
have
a
professor
telling
me
what
I
had
to
write
about.
I
found
it
really
difficult
to
narrow
down
the
galaxy
of
choices.
I
don't
even
remember
how
many
times
I
changed
topics.
However,
one
thing
remained
constant.
I
insisted
on
following
the
Shakespearian
form.
I
just
loved
the
ironic
tone
of
Shakespeare's
sonnet
130(?).
I
saw
fantastic
possibilities
with
the
big
switch
in
the
last
two
lines.
Finally,
I
overcame
the
writers'
block
and
finished
my
masterpiece.
It
was
a
critique
of
the
Lafayette
focus
on
drinking.
The
narrator
wakes
up
after
a
night
of
heavy
drinking
with
a
bad
hangover.
I
avoided
the
use
of
any
names
or
personal
pronouns
in
an
attempt
to
make
the
story
universal.
The
narrator
expresses
for
eleven
lines
how
bad
s/he
fells.
In
the
last
two
lines,
s/he
proclaims
that
s/he
has
to
go
out
because
it
is
time
to
drink
again.
From
the
way
I
explained
it
above,
this
poem
must
not
sound
all
that
good.
Not
to
toot
my
own
horn,
but
it
actually
was
pretty
good
(toot!toot!).
When
I
got
the
poem
back,
I
was
very
pleased
to
see
that
my
teacher
agreed.
She
gave
me
an
A
and
even
suggested
that
I
submit
it
for
inclusion
in
the
Marquis.
I
thought
about
it
but
did
not
submit
it.
I
don't
know
why.
During
my
sophomore
year,
I
took
what
I
consider
one
of
the
best
courses
I
have
taken
to
date.
Satire
and
the
Comic
Absurd
was
as
interesting
as
I
had
expected.
For
every
class,
the
students
had
to
write
a
one
page
response
to
the
reading.
However,
this
response
did
not
have
to
be
an
analysis
of
the
text.
Because
they
were
not
graded,
these
responses
often
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
take
chances
and
be
really
creative.
Over
the
course
of
the
semester,
I
wrote
about
things
that
I
never
thought
I'd
write
about.
I
wrote
about
a
musical
parody
I
had
heard
of
Two
Live
Crew's
Ooh,
So
Horny
-
Two
Live
Jew's
Oy,
So
Humid.
I
wrote
about
religious
fanatics
talking
about
the
end
of
the
world
on
the
New
York
subways.
I
even
tried
my
hand
at
writing
my
own
version
of
Swift's
A
Modest
Proposal.
Though
I
didn't
like
having
to
write
something
everyday,
these
responses
are
definitely
my
most
valued
writing
experiences.
