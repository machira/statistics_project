Literary
Narrative
WA
Workshop
August
28,
1995
My
first
experiences
with
writing
occurred
in
Nursery
School
as
the
alphabet,
numbers,
and
colors
were
introduced.
I
always
loved
to
make
things
for
my
family
and
friends,
so
my
first
applications
of
writing
are
found
in
various
cards
and
letters
I
wrote
to
them.
Written
in
crayon
with
words
broken
randomly
in
the
middle
and
continued
on
the
next
line
these
attempts
at
birthday
cards
or
valentines
to
my
mother
are
now
treasured
memories
either
because
of
the
spelling
or
the
amount
of
effort
that
went
into
their
creation.
In
elementary
school
writing
became
a
form
of
dreaded
homework
because
of
its
difficulty.
Every
report
card
I
would
receive
high
marks
with
the
exception
of
one
check
in
handwriting
which
symbolized
needs
improvement
.
Until
almost
forth
grade
I
struggled
with
learning
to
write
in
the
cursive
style
on
those
awful
green
sheets
of
paper
with
blue
dotted
lines.
I
couldn't
see
the
point
of
writing
the
same
letter
a
million
times
so
that
if
I
did
well
I
could
take
the
sheet
home
and
have
the
letter
w
plastered
on
my
refrigerator.
But
gradually
I
learned
to
take
time
with
the
actual
writing
part
of
expressing
my
thoughts
and
began
to
enjoy
writing
for
itself.
I
began
a
diary
in
fifth
grade
which
was
my
outlet
for
every
trauma
and
excitement
I
had
throughout
high
school.
I
faithfully
wrote
in
it
every
day
and
I
sometimes
read
it
today
and
bring
back
all
the
funny
memories
I
had
in
elementary
school
and
junior
high.
It
was
my
place
to
say
what
ever
I
wanted
and
voice
my
innermost
thoughts
and
dreams.
Because
I
never
was
very
outgoing,
my
diary
almost
became
another
friend
to
me,
but
without
any
of
the
judgmental
qualities
I
experienced
with
some
of
my
peers.
The
best
experience
I
had
with
writing
was
in
the
third
grade
when
we
made
our
own
books.
I
wrote
a
fantasy
story
about
a
girl
and
her
unicorn,
illustrated
the
pictures,
decorated
the
binding,
and
even
dedicated
it
to
my
little
sister.
I
was
really
enthusiastic
about
this
project
because
there
were
absolutely
no
boundaries
to
what
we
could
write
about.
I
also
love
drawing
and
being
able
to
create
the
pictures
to
show
exactly
what
I
had
envisioned
for
my
imaginary
characters.
The
end
of
elementary
school
and
most
of
junior
high
developed
a
rather
negative
attitude
in
me
toward
writing.
The
assignments
we
received
were
dry
and
informational
type
essays
where
I
would
be
required
to
write
a
few
pages
about
the
life
of
a
WWI
hero
or
a
place
I
visited
on
a
class
trip.
These
papers
allowed
for
no
self
expression;
we
were
basically
expected
to
do
the
research
and
regurgitate
the
facts
in
an
understandable
manner.
As
easy
as
this
was
for
me,
I
hated
this
kind
of
writing
as
much
as
those
What
I
Did
Over
My
Summer
Vacation
essays
which
all
of
my
english
teachers
were
so
enamored
of.
My
junior
high
school
teachers
also
required
us
to
keep
an
in
class
journal
where
they
would
provide
the
topic
for
the
day
and
we
would
write
our
thoughts
on
the
subject.
The
journal
entries
were
fun
to
write
and
the
topics
ranged
from
our
opinion
on
the
presidential
election
to
what
we
would
do
if
we
won
the
lottery.
I
liked
this
kind
of
writing
because
although
it
was
restricted
to
a
specific
topic
we
were
encouraged
to
be
creative
and
express
our
opinions.
Some
of
my
views
on
politics
and
solutions
to
our
earths
problems
were
pretty
comical.
One
topic
was
What
is
freedom?
.
My
answers
to
this
deep
philosophical
question
included:
freedom
is
finishing
your
homework
in
time
for
Growing
Pains
and
freedom
is
eating
pizza
every
day.
The
only
drawback
to
these
journals
was
the
fact
that
they
were
turned
in,
read
by
the
teacher,
and
returned
with
spelling
errors
corrected,
and
graded.
This
put
a
slight
damper
on
complete
free
expression
but
it
was
one
of
the
few
writing
assignments
of
junior
high
that
I
didn't
mind.
Despite
not
really
enjoying
writing
in
junior
high
my
grades
in
my
english
classes
were
always
good
and
I
was
placed
in
honors
classes
for
high
school.
I
did
like
english
but
at
the
end
of
ninth
grade
I
still
would
prefer
to
do
pages
and
pages
of
geometry
than
write
a
short
essay
on
the
life
of
Mark
Twain.
In
the
tenth
and
eleventh
grades
I
had
a
big
change
in
attitude
towards
literature
and
writing.
The
books
we
read
were
fiction,
and
although
we
had
a
research
paper,
my
teacher
allowed
us
to
be
creative
with
the
topics
and
presentation.
I
did
a
biography
of
James
Thurber
and
made
a
collage
of
a
number
of
his
dog
illustrations
which
were
really
amusing
to
me.
In
tenth
grade
I
had
Mr.
Wiener
who
had
us
bring
in
song
lyrics
we
thought
were
poetical.
I
first
began
to
love
english
class
when
he
would
have
us
read
poetry.
I
loved
the
way
these
poets
could
express
their
ideas
and
use
beautiful
imagery
and
symbolism
and
I
began
to
try
to
imitate
on
my
own.
By
eleventh
grade
I
was
writing
poetry
pretty
regularly
and
writing
in
a
diary.
My
eleventh
grade
english
teacher
was
my
favorite
teacher
of
high
school.
Although
his
little
gimmicks
to
get
us
to
enjoy
writing
were
a
little
cheesy,
we
all
loved
his
corny
jokes
and
sense
of
humor.
His
big
idea
was
the
Golden
Pen
,
an
award
given
for
every
essay,
in
class
or
take
home,
that
we
wrote
that
year.
The
winner
would
get
her
or
his
name
written
on
the
bulletin
board
and
a
little
certificate.
It
was
definitely
made
fun
of
constantly
but
when
it
came
time
for
the
class
to
vote
on
which
of
the
essays
deserved
this
stupid
award
everyone
suddenly
took
it
very
seriously.
I
was
nominated
for
the
award
a
few
times,
but
the
one
time
I
won
was
the
most
embarrassing
time
of
my
high
school
experience.
I'm
quite
to
almost
an
antisocial
level,
preferring
to
blend
into
the
background
and
when
my
Golden
Pen
winning
fictional
story
was
read
aloud
to
the
class
I
had
to
leave.
I
think
I
was
so
embarrassed
because
this
was
a
story
I
had
made
up
completely
from
my
imagination
and
fantasies
and
I
really
didn't
ask
for
it
to
be
shared
with
my
peers.
If
it
had
been
one
of
those
dry
essays
on
some
dead
person's
life
I
would
have
had
no
problem
listening
to
it
as
it
was
read
before
the
class,
because
it
wouldn't
have
been
my
own
thoughts
and
feelings
written
down
for
all
to
criticize.
Although
I
might
enjoy
writing
fiction
or
poetry
more
than
research
papers,
this
kind
of
writing
is
rarely
shown
to
my
family
or
friends
because
it
becomes
too
personal.
My
writing
of
that
style
is
literally
an
extension
of
myself
and
is,
in
some
ways,
even
more
vulnerable.
I
was
very
happy
for
the
recognition
of
winning
that
silly
golden
pen
and
after
I
got
over
the
embarrassment
I
began
to
write
even
more
in
my
free
time.
By
senior
year
in
high
school
it
was
one
of
my
major
outlets
for
my
emotions
and
still
is.
I
felt
pretty
prepared
for
college
writing
by
the
time
I
graduated
from
high
school.
My
AP
english
class
was
very
hard
and
we
did
a
lot
of
work
on
revision
and
polishing
our
writing.
My
freshman
seminar
seemed
to
pick
up
right
where
I
had
left
off
and
I
think
with
each
paper
I
write
I
can
improve
my
skills
in
some
way.
My
experience
as
WA
for
a
freshman
seminar
last
year
has
shown
me
that
not
everyone
was
quite
as
prepared
for
college
writing
as
I
was.
Although
I
hated
sentence
graphing
and
grammar
exercises,
they
ingrained
in
me
a
certain
feeling
for
the
english
language.
I
don't
have
all
the
grammar
laws
memorized
but
I
can
basically
tell
if
something
just
isn't
right.
It
was
surprising
to
me
how
a
few
of
my
students
last
year
did
not
even
have
that
kind
of
basic
knowledge.
Last
semester
marked
another
relatively
big
change
in
my
writing
history
when
I
decided
to
double
major
my
BS
psychology
program
with
english.
This
decision
stemmed
largely
from
my
WA
experience
and
the
withdrawal
I
went
through
first
semester
sophomore
year
when
I
didn't
have
any
writing
classes.
As
a
psychology
major
I
had
three
labs
and
I
missed
the
balance
my
english
classes
provided.
Now
I
look
forward
to
my
three
writing
classes
this
semester
and
learning
more
from
my
WA
experience.
Writing
will
always
be
a
way
for
me
to
express
myself
whether
I
allow
others
to
read
my
poetry
or
I
create
some
fictional
tale
that
is
a
little
more
autobiographical
than
I'd
like
to
admit.
