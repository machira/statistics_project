New
WA
Literacy
Narrative
From
Scribbles
to
Poetry
In
elementary
school,
I
considered
writing
a
full
sentence
an
achievement.
There
it
sat
staring
at
me,
boldfaced
in
purple
crayon,
and
I
smiled
with
pride.
What
would
I
write
next?
I
had
absolutely
no
idea.
The
length
or
the
completion
of
a
writing
assignment
was
not
my
concern.
At
that
age,
I
considered
one
full
page
as
potential
for
my
first
bestselling
novel.
I
didnOt
care
if
the
story
made
no
sense.
I
wasnOt
worried
about
plot,
character
development,
or
dialogue.
My
stories
and
even
my
papers
were
affected
so
deeply
by
my
imagination,
that
in
five
sentences,
the
story
would
be
complete
and
the
characters
could
have
visited
three
continents.
I
would
let
my
imagination
wander
and
it
was
only
after
my
crayon
dropped
that
I
began
to
iron
out
all
the
grammatical
errors.
When
I
was
younger,
making
sure
my
letters
didnOt
sink
below
or
soar
above
the
lines
(NsubmarinesO
and
NairplanesO
as
my
third
grade
teacher
called
them)
became
a
fulltime
investment
for
me
when
writing
anything.
I
would
have
to
double
check,
and
then
even
triple
check
my
spelling.
Until
middle
school,
writing
was
more
perfection
than
creation.
My
parents
have
always
been
supportive
of
my
writing,
encouraging
me
to
use
my
imagination
and
to
write
often.
My
mom
would
place
my
stories
on
the
refrigerator
door,
underneath
a
magnet
that
said,
NLook
what
did!O
To
this
day,
I
wonder
if
this
praise
was
insincere
because
the
stories
I
wrote
were
closer
to
a
stonerOs
daydream
than
actual
art.
The
storyline
was
crazy
but
my
Mom-Mom
still
showed
my
one
story
to
all
her
nurses
when
she
was
in
the
hospital.
Since
my
first
writing
days,
it
only
took
one
compliment
to
have
me
all
aglow
with
happiness.
But
after
a
few
minutes,
the
insecurities
swoop
in
for
the
kill
and
I
begin
to
wonder,
NIs
she
lying?O
NDoes
he
really
think
my
short
story
is
worth
the
honor
of
that
apple
sticker?O
Despite
this
stress,
when
I
was
little
writing
was
pure
enjoyment
and
a
chance
to
escape
into
worlds
I
had
imagined.
With
middle
school,
writing
became
the
itch
I
couldnOt
scratch.
I
looked
over
the
paper
so
often
and
for
such
a
long
time,
I
was
expecting
it
to
wilt
under
the
intensity
of
my
gaze.
There
was
something
wrong
D
no,
there
had
to
be
something
wrong.
The
paperOs
conclusion
might
fall
flat
or
the
title
was
absurd.
Maybe
the
heading
had
too
many
spaces
in
between
lines.
Even
after
three
drafts,
I
was
positive
my
paper
sucked.
Eventually,
I
became
disgusted
with
the
very
sight
of
the
paper
and
would
stalk
away
in
frustration.
I
would
blame
the
teacher
for
his
outrageous
demands,
scoffing
at
the
idea
of
a
ten
page
paper
on
Treasure
Island
when
all
I
remembered
was
watching
Pirates
of
the
Caribbean
after
we
read
the
book.
Then
I
would
glare
at
the
prompt,
accusing
it
of
being
too
vague
or
too
detailed.
But
after
all
that
stress,
most
of
my
papers
were
returned
with
high
scores.
The
papers
of
my
middle
school
days
were
difficult
compared
to
the
fairy
tales
I
fabricated
in
elementary
school.
The
prompts
would
ask
me
to
analyze
a
characterOs
actions,
delve
into
the
authorial
intentions
(though
no
one
had
a
clue),
and
above
all
defend
my
thesis
with
an
iron
fist.
The
outline
seemed
simple
enough:
the
introduction,
your
argument,
and
then
the
conclusion.
I
wrote
mostly
five-paragraph
essays
in
my
English
classes,
and
the
prompt
would
ask
me
to
dissect
the
book
until
it
was
good
and
dead.
The
introduction
was
simple
enough
and
sometimes
I
would
have
trouble
ending
my
introduction
to
actually
begin
the
essay.
I
loved
babbling
endlessly
about
what
I
planned
to
write
the
paper
on
before
I
gained
the
courage
to
write
the
good
stuff.
I
would
constantly
take
breathers,
stepping
away
from
the
computer
and
finding
some
excuse
to
procrastinate.
But
when
I
forced
myself
to
stay
firmly
planted
in
my
chair,
pages
would
fly
by
at
an
alarming
speed.
When
the
paper
is
on
an
English
topic,
I
have
always
found
it
much
too
easy
to
type
and
type
until
the
paper
is
done
and
my
fingers
feel
like
theyOre
about
to
fall
off.
Unless
I
have
the
cursed
writerOs
block
(the
writerOs
excuse
for
a
blank
page)
the
paper
will
be
finished
quickly.
The
conclusion
was
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
paper
for
me
and
it
still
is
today.
By
that
point
of
the
paper,
I
am
sick
and
tired
of
writing
and
if
I
saw
the
paper
again
in
20
years,
it
would
be
too
soon.
In
middle
school,
grammatical
errors
were
never
a
huge
issue
for
me
during
the
editing
process.
There
might
be
a
stray
comma
that
didnOt
belong
or
one
typo,
but
the
rest
was
mainly
error
free.
Teachers
always
commented
on
my
sentence
structure,
noting
that
several
sentences
would
sound
much
better
if
I
simply
rearranged
a
few
words.
The
word
of
the
day
was
always
Nawkward.O
My
word
choice
was
NawkwardO
or
my
word
flow
was
Nawkward.O
I
was
frustrated
every
time
I
received
a
paper
with
this
comment
somewhere.
Sometimes
there
would
be
a
question
the
teacher
would
want
me
to
answer
further
in
my
paper.
There
would
always
be
one
part
of
the
prompt
that
I
needed
to
follow
more,
making
a
part
of
the
paper
weak.
In
middle
school
there
was
hardly
any
peer
reading
and
less
time
allowed
to
finish
a
paper.
In
high
school,
research
papers
were
more
frequent.
As
in
college,
the
class
would
be
taken
to
the
library
and
we
would
find
sources
for
our
paper.
Our
teachers
provided
assistance
and
returned
our
rough
drafts
so
we
could
edit
and
work
towards
our
final
paper.
The
papers
were
relatively
shorter
than
any
paper
IOve
written
in
college.
There
was
very
little
time
given
to
finish
the
paper
and
there
was
less
attention
to
detail.
The
senior
paper
was
the
only
paper
that
truly
prepared
me
for
some
of
the
papers
I
would
conquer
in
college.
The
paper
in
its
entirety
was
at
least
20
pages
and
used
at
least
15
sources.
My
high
schoolOs
writing
program
babied
me
and
did
not
fully
prepare
me
for
the
papers
I
would
write
in
the
future.
The
papers
I
wrote
during
high
school
were
less
of
a
challenge
and
asked
very
little
of
me
in
the
prompt.
Instead
of
the
thorough
research
and
detailed
arguments
I
write
in
college,
high
school
rarely
required
me
to
explore
different
sources
or
familiarize
myself
with
other
writing
genres.
The
variety
of
subjects
we
wrote
on
was
also
limited.
In
college,
I
have
been
asked
to
write
papers
on
a
plethora
of
topics,
from
the
dire
straits
our
environment
is
in
due
to
the
condition
of
our
feedlots
to
the
five
stages
of
grieving
someone
endures
after
losing
a
loved
one.
In
high
school,
paper
topics
were
confined
to
observing
character
development
in
Wuthering
Heights
or
the
underlying
themes
of
Catcher
in
the
Rye.
I
had
very
little
to
no
experience
in
scientific
writing
or
in
finding
the
articles
I
needed
in
order
to
complete
my
paper.
High
school
also
offered
few
opportunities
to
indulge
in
my
favorite
activity:
creative
writing.
The
good
old
days
of
writing
fantastical
little
stories
and
fabricating
fairytales
were
lost
in
middle
school
and
then
high
school.
We
had
a
literary
magazine
but
creative
writing
workshops
were
not
available
along
with
any
creative
writing
courses
I
could
gain
writing
practice
from.
It
wasnOt
until
college
that
I
found
my
writing
improving
with
practice,
for
I
was
finally
given
the
proper
resources
to
flourish.
I
was
able
to
enroll
in
creative
writing
courses
and
I
was
required
to
keep
a
regular
journal.
When
I
entered
college,
I
knew
I
wanted
to
become
a
published
writer
following
graduation
and
I
worked
for
my
bachelorOs
degree
in
English
with
a
writing
concentration
(until
it
changed
to
a
literature
concentration).
But
it
was
not
until
I
arrived
on
campus
and
took
certain
courses
that
I
found
my
love
for
poetry.
My
interest
in
poetry
only
grew
and
I
really
benefitted
from
the
advice
and
comments
of
my
fellow
classmates.
Creative
writing
workshops
offered
me
a
chance
to
gain
necessary
feedback
and
also
to
give
my
classmates
the
help
they
desired.
I
learned
to
write
with
patience
and
to
take
every
comment
under
consideration.
There
were
some
ideas
I
listened
to
while
others
I
had
to
disregard.
I
had
to
make
sacrifices,
or
as
my
one
professor
said,
NYou
have
to
kill
your
darlings.O
It
was
painful
but
sometimes
I
had
to
eliminate
my
favorite
lines
in
my
poems
or
short
stories
and
save
them
for
another
time.
No
matter
how
many
times
I
would
read
a
piece,
there
was
always
something
I
missed
that
another
person
would
notice
in
one
of
our
many
workshops.
Sometimes
I
honestly
resented
people
for
telling
me
to
change
my
title
or
for
asking
me
to
reconsider
my
word
choice.
I
knew
they
were
just
trying
to
help,
but
I
had
reached
the
point
where
I
was
blind
to
any
mistakes
and
I
worshipped
certain
words
or
was
so
fixed
on
not
changing
anything.
I
was
scared
at
times
to
rip
apart
a
poem
or
start
over
fresh.
Other
times,
I
heard
their
suggestions
and
was
so
grateful
to
hear
wonderful
ideas
I
probably
would
have
never
thought
of
on
my
own.
My
parents
are
still
supportive
of
my
writing
and
their
encouragement
boosts
my
self-esteem.
Sometimes,
I
want
my
mom
to
just
say,
NI
donOt
like
this,
this,
and
this.O
Yet
every
time
without
fail
she
says
she
loves
my
poems
and
short
stories.
She
might
prefer
one
to
another
but
she
never
openly
criticizes
my
writing
or
offers
any
helpful
suggestions.
I
just
say,
NYou
have
to
say
that
because
youOre
my
mom.O
But
she
laughs
and
denies
it,
saying
she
would
love
my
work
no
matter
what.
I
know
I
can
never
go
to
either
of
my
parents
for
any
critical
observation,
for
they
would
never
say
anything
but,
NSeems
good
to
me.O
This
is
why
I
appreciate
the
feedback
professors
and
students
offer
at
school.
Later
in
life,
I
wonOt
have
so
many
people
ready
and
willing
to
read
my
work.
In
the
future,
I
will
miss
having
all
of
these
workshops
because
I
will
want
someone
to
look
over
my
work.
Even
some
of
my
friends
read
my
work
if
I
ask
and
mark
it
up
for
me,
telling
me
their
honest
opinions.
When
they
give
me
suggested
changes,
I
take
it
in
and
I
may
feel
sensitive
or
hurt.
I
try
to
avoid
asking
friends
unless
I
absolutely
need
someone
else
to
read
my
work
because
I
feel
weird
hearing
suggestions
from
my
close
friends.
ItOs
comparable
to
having
a
close
family
member
as
your
teacher
and
having
them
give
you
a
D
on
an
essay.
Resentment
and
tension
are
bound
to
build
up
in
result.
In
my
classes,
students
were
generally
shocked
by
the
sensuality
and
darkness
of
my
poetry.
At
first,
I
was
very
uncomfortable
reading
my
poetry
out
loud
because
I
had
never
done
so
before.
Poetry
was
still
relatively
new
to
me,
and
I
was
intimidated
by
the
circle
of
upturned
faces
all
watching
me
as
I
stood
at
the
podium.
The
audienceOs
reaction
was
usually
of
an
openmouthed
variety
as
they
were
taken
aback
by
the
dark
topics
I
wrote
about.
I
wrote
about
anything
from
abortion
to
domestic
violence.
Instead
of
the
negative
reception
I
expected,
most
people
complimented
my
work
and
enjoyed
my
reading.
There
were
always
a
few
though
that
thought
it
was
a
bit
too
much,
and
they
would
suggest
toning
it
down
a
bit.
But
in
general,
I
ignored
those
comments,
thinking
they
were
unfamiliar
with
poetry
that
didnOt
talk
about
pretty
trees
and
some
woman
named
Lenore.
The
people
I
listened
to
the
most
were
my
professors,
especially
one
professor
who
has
helped
my
poetry
to
evolve
for
years
now.
She
showered
my
work
with
compliments
but
wasnOt
afraid
to
cross
out
and
even
use
every
available
space
left
to
write
notes.
In
college,
I
have
to
write
so
much
more
than
I
had
to
in
high
school.
Sometimes,
I
wish
that
high
school
teachers
had
prepared
me
more
for
the
real
world.
If
I
had
written
more
back
then,
I
would
have
more
experience
under
my
belt
and
maybe
my
love
for
poetry
would
have
started
earlier.
My
writing
in
college
has
come
a
long
way
since
the
papers
of
freshman
year.
Yet
there
are
times
when
I
am
done
with
writing,
and
I
consider
every
pen
and
paper
absolutely
toxic
to
me.
Sometimes
too
much
writing
almost
drives
me
crazy,
and
I
am
flooded
with
so
many
ideas,
I
can
barely
write
them
all
down
or
type
fast
enough.
My
writing
will
never
reach
perfection,
no
matter
how
many
times
I
read
a
paper
or
how
many
typos
I
cross
out,
but
my
writing
skill
has
progressed
greatly
since
the
scribbles
of
elementary
school.
