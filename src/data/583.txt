WA
Summer
Essay
How
I've
Grown
To
Be
A
More
Confused
Writer
When
you
declare
yourself
as
a
Computer
Science
major,
you
are
effectively
signing
an
implicit
contract
that
states
you
shall
not
write
anymore
essays
for
the
rest
of
your
college
career.
Yes,
there
is
a
required
VAST
course,
but
the
writing
assignments
are
mere
supplements
to
the
more
important
content
presented
in
class.
Many,
of
course,
would
rejoice
when
confronted
with
this
proposition.
This
may
be
an
ungrounded
generalization,
but
those
who
enter
the
computer
science
field
are
often
adamant
towards
formal
writing.
When
am
I
going
to
need
to
write
an
essay?

All
I'll
ever
need
to
do
is
draw
diagrams
and
write
code.
Whether
or
not
this
hypothetical
quotation
holds
any
validity,
our
college
can
only
fit
so
many
courses
into
a
major,
and
so
those
bizarre
few
Computer
Science
majors
looking
to
expand
their
writing
are
left
with
limited
options.
Some
opt
to
take
on
a
second
major
or
a
minor,
while
others
seek
out
extracurricular
activities.
I
decided
to
take
both
routes.
Fortunately
for
me,
these
two
different
routes
each
provided
me
with
a
unique
exposure
to
writing.
Indeed,
over
the
past
year
they
have
proven
to
be
ideal
complements.
The
written
assignments
from
my
Math/Economics
major
provided
me
with
the
opportunity
for
practice
missing
from
the
computer
science
curriculum,
while
my
job
as
a
WA
gave
me
a
behind-the-scenes
role
as
it
placed
me
into
the
criticOs
seat.
By
regularly
practicing
writing
in
a
disciplined
manner,
while
reinforcing
my
work
with
the
breadth
of
styles
presented
to
me
at
work,
I
felt
myself
concluding
the
year
with
a
greater
humility
towards
the
process
than
ever
before.
At
the
same
time,
my
viewpoint
towards
writing,
and
particularly
its
execution,
has
become
increasingly
flippant.
What
I
used
to
think
of
as
a
clearly
defined
sequence
of
actions
implemented
in
a
homogenous
manner,
now
begets
me
to
question
its
diversity
and
practicality.
For
instance,
what
is
the
purpose
of
all
the
complicated
prose,
at
least
when
written
for
the
workplace?
Why
encourage
different
types
of
writing
styles
if
the
single
purpose
of
writing
for
work
is
to
communicate
a
particular
message?
I
now
wonder
if
writing
is
so
much
different
from
a
science,
such
that
a
written
workOs
effectiveness
can
actually
be
quantified.
Regardless,
I
have
shifting
attitudes
toward
writing,
and
I
consider
this
to
be
more
of
a
sign
of
maturity
rather
than
a
step
back
into
child-like
confusion.
I
feel
like
IOve
taken
the
step
from
naivety
to
a
point
where
IOm
able
to
pose
a
more
informed,
though
self-admittedly
underdeveloped,
critique
of
writing.
This
is
what
I
consider
to
be
my
most
tangible
development
with
regards
to
writing
over
the
past
year.
As
far
as
school-related
assignments,
the
course
Financial
Theory
was
my
main
source
of
writing
practice.
I
was
fortunate
in
that
the
course
required
a
variety
of
writing
tasks,
such
that
I
came
out
of
the
course
with
a
more
broadened
skill
set.
Not
only
did
I
gain
exposure
to
journalistic
writing
by
reading
the
Wall
Street
Journal
everyday
(a
practice
which
I
continue
to
this
day),
I
learned
how
to
write
critiques,
condensed
article
summaries,
and
financial
analyses.
The
unifying
factor
among
all
these
assignments,
which
lends
support
to
my
homogeneous
writing
theory,
is
that
they
required
me
to
make
a
clear,
accurate
point
with
proper
support
from
a
particular
source.
No
flowery
language,
no
strict
requirement
of
stylistic
formalities.
I
was
free
to
state
my
mind,
make
the
connection
to
the
source,
and
move
onto
the
next
point.
It
still
surprises
me
that
when
I
sit
down
to
write
a
typical
essay,
I
end
up
spending
more
time
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
write
the
perfect-sounding
introduction,
or
what
transition
to
add
at
the
end
and
beginning
of
a
paragraph,
or
how
to
finish
off
the
essay
with
a
resounding
conclusion,
than
I
do
on
the
actual
body
paragraphs.
The
very
fact
that
IOm
often
more
worried
about
how
pleasant
my
writing
sounds
than
how
informative
my
essay
is
tells
me
there
is
some
implicit
pressure
on
prose
and
style
rather
than
on
content.
It
was
refreshing
to
see
a
professor
openly
favor
direct,
written
communication
over
writing
formalities.
Of
course,
being
a
WA
has
exposed
me
to
a
different,
though
strangely
relevant,
aspect
of
writing.
The
focus
is
on
revision.
The
emphasis
is
on
reader-based
prose.
If
a
WA
were
only
able
to
accomplish
one
thing
during
a
meeting
with
a
student,
it
would
be
making
sure
that
the
reader
can
understand
what
the
writer
was
trying
to
say.
Forget
fixing
the
parenthetical
notations,
picking
out
comma
splices,
and
worrying
about
transitions.
If
the
reader
doesnOt
understand
whatOs
going
on,
then
what
purpose
does
the
essay
serve?
I
donOt
think
the
obvious
logic
behind
this
statement
truly
hit
me
until
it
was
drilled
into
my
head
by
the
CWP.
Granted,
the
WA
position
was
also
what
introduced
me
to
the
higher
intricacies
of
writing.
Discussing
the
education
of
writing,
and
what
separates
the
poor
student
writers
from
the
more
advanced
ones,
showed
me
that
there
are
indeed
metrics
for
assessing
quality
writing.
There
is
this
idea
that
claims
the
good
student
writers
are
able
to
simulate
a
voice
of
authority
in
their
writing,
such
that
they
pretend
to
be
on
par
in
knowledge
and
experience
with
whomever
is
grading
or
assessing
the
written
work.
Now
this
may
be
a
more
cynical
interpretation
of
what
was
discussed
during
staff
meetings,
but
still
there
is
a
suggestion
that
the
good
writer
should
assume
a
voice
different
from
their
own.
Yes
they
may
be
expressing
their
own
thoughts
and
ideas,
but
they
should
do
so
behind
a
mask
of
importance
and
authority.
This
seems
almost
pretentious.
It
probably
would
be
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
such
students
get
rewarded
with
praise,
awe,
and
good
grades.
Now
I'm
not
in
any
way
saying
that
all
writing
professionals
and
professors
are
wrong
in
their
assessments.
It
actually
makes
sense
to
prepare
students
for
their
professional
careers
by
getting
them
to
write
with
a
voice
of
authority
before
they
leave
college.
What
doesn't
make
sense
to
me,
however,
is
why
so
many
writing
formalities
come
packaged
with
this
voice.
A
good
introduction
may
grab
a
reader's
attention,
but
does
interesting
really
relate
to
knowledge
or
understandability?
What
about
the
abundance
of
intricate
grammatical
rules?
Currently,
my
sister
is
pursuing
her
master's
degree
in
English
Linguistics.
She
asked
me
one
time
which
of
the
following
is
the
correct
phrase:
I'm
on
line
at
the
store
or
I'm
in
line
at
the
store.
I
wasn't
too
confident
in
my
answer,
and
I
started
out
by
saying,
Well
I
think
'in
line'
is
the
semantically
correct
phrase,
butE
at
which
point
my
sister
immediately
interrupted
me
and
said,
That
doesn't
matter.

Which
makes
sense
in
conversation?
That
certainly
was
the
last
thing
I
expected
to
hear
from
a
linguistics
major,
considering
that
I
always
thought
studying
English
Linguistics
was
equivalent
to
studying
proper
English
but
with
a
fancier
title.
After
telling
her
that
both
phrases
made
sense,
she
explained
to
me
that
the
study
of
linguistics
does
not
care
about
the
fine
details
of
grammar
and
semantics.
It
cares
about
how
messages
are
communicated.
Common
slang
and
the
various
colloquialisms
in
American
culture
can
be
considered
their
own
language,
because
they
follow
a
certain
structure
and
allow
for
unambiguous
communication
(they
are,
after
all,
derivatives
of
the
English
language).
The
point
is,
getting
a
message
to
its
recipient
in
a
clear
manner
far
outweighs
any
other
considerations
when
it
comes
to
communication
in
the
world
of
linguistics.
This
is
a
very
appealing
idea,
and
I
think
exploring
the
differences
between
writing
and
other
forms
of
communication
is
part
of
my
next
step
in
growing
as
a
writer.
Strangely
enough,
some
of
my
best
experiences
as
a
WA
over
the
past
year
have
come
from
working
with
students
who
take
the
exact
opposite
approach
to
writing
as
the
one
I've
been
describing.
Whether
or
not
it's
the
approach
they
believe
to
be
ideal,
it's
the
approach
that
gets
them
the
A.
Now
despite
my
mixed
feelings
towards
adhering
to
the
proper
formalities
of
writing,
it
is
my
job
as
a
WA
to
help
a
student
improve
their
writing
in
whichever
way
they
want.
If
that
means
conforming
to
their
teachers'
expectations
by
following
all
the
grammar
rules,
making
an
electrifying
introduction,
and
transitioning
between
every
paragraph,
then
so
be
it.
The
fact
of
the
matter
is,
I'm
a
computer
science
major.
The
thought
of
taking
an
algorithmic
approach
to
writing
definitely
is
appealing,
and
I
always
love
it
when
a
student
shares
this
same
spirit.
We
would
go
through
each
sentence,
making
sure
it
sounds
perfect
and
completely
spotless
in
terms
of
grammatical
errors.
We
would
check
that
the
paper
read
smoothly
and
effortlessly,
with
no
ambiguities
to
be
found.
Not
only
did
I
enjoy
moving
line
by
line
through
an
essay
like
a
debugger
through
a
piece
of
code,
but
I
liked
the
idea
that
all
grammatical
errors
could
be
resolved
by
looking
in
a
book
or
online
for
an
answer.
The
only
aspect
of
revision
left
to
our
own
subjectivity
was
word
choice
and
how
phrases
sounded,
but
the
fact
that
there
were
two
of
us
debating
over
which
words
sounded
best
at
least
added
logic
to
the
equation,
because
a
particular
word
would
only
win
when
both
of
us
agreed
that
it
made
the
most
sense.
It
was
these
types
of
students,
though
very
far,
few,
and
in
between,
that
surprisingly
made
working
drop-in
for
a
semester
more
interesting
than
working
with
my
first
class
as
a
WA.
All
that
being
said,
my
role
as
a
WA
has
definitely
taught
me
one
thing
about
writing
that
I
did
not
know
about:
I
enjoy
discussing
it.
If
it's
not
debating
the
merits
of
formalities,
then
it's
debating
over
the
best
formalities.
Either
way,
I
enjoy
talking
about
writing.
The
staff
meetings
have
introduced
me
to
thinking
about
writing
from
a
more
abstract
perspective,
but
not
so
abstract
that
it
loses
practicality.
Working
with
students
has
helped
align
my
thoughts
from
weekly
discussions
to
my
work
as
a
WA,
and
it's
always
enjoyable
when
I
can
relate
one
of
the
readings
from
our
staff
meetings
to
an
experience
I've
had
on
the
job.
I've
reached
a
point
where
I
enjoy
talking
about
writing
more
than
I
enjoy
actually
writing.
Fostering
a
greater
appreciation
for
discussing
writing
was
not
my
only
major
development
as
a
writer
over
the
past
year.
I've
also
seen
my
writing
skills
noticeably
improve,
much
in
part
due
to
the
summer
course
I
took
at
Rutgers
University.
Seeing
as
how
I
had
not
completed
my
college
writing
requirement
by
the
end
of
my
sophomore
year,
I
decided
to
take
an
equivalent
course
at
a
different
institution.
Rutgers
was
offering
an
expository
writing
class,
which
luckily
could
count
for
English
110
here
at
Lafayette.
I
figured
expository
literally
means
advanced
or
college-level,
but
I
soon
learned
that
it
refers
to
an
entirely
different
style
of
writing
to
which
I
had
never
been
accustomed.
Expository
writing
is
a
style
in
which
the
writer
presents
some
sort
of
analysis
on
a
topic,
perhaps
in
response
to
a
broad
question,
by
connecting
the
opinions
of
various
authors
from
relevant
sources.
My
expository
writing
class
had
me
write
six
such
essays,
one
of
which
required
connecting
three
different
authors
discussing
almost
entirely
different
topics.
Seeing
as
how
I
had
never
actually
written
in
this
precise
style,
the
heavy
analytical
thinking
that
was
required,
along
with
the
constant
adherence
to
certain
rules
such
as
how
to
introduce
authors
or
make
a
complex
thesis,
forced
me
to
actually
take
my
time
with
the
essays.
Honestly,
there
were
times
when
I
would
spend
almost
an
hour
just
trying
to
write
three
sentences
in
a
body
paragraph,
just
to
ensure
that
there
was
a
seamless
connection
between
two
particular
authors.
It
was
refreshing
to
actually
take
a
course
designed
to
improve
my
writing,
as
opposed
to
simply
showcasing
it.
Also,
I
learned
that
you're
grammatically-speaking
not
supposed
to
use
phrases
like
However
and
Yet
at
the
beginning
of
sentences.
That
piece
of
knowledge
in
itself
transformed
my
writing.
Wrapping
up,
I've
grown
a
lot
as
a
writer
over
the
past
year
considering
I
only
took
a
computer
science
VAST
class
and
a
summer
writing
course.
As
the
title
of
this
essay
says,
I'm
a
lot
more
confused
in
terms
of
my
opinions
on
writing.
I
wonder
if
free-form
writing,
or
a
maybe
scientific,
dry
style,
is
more
useful
than
the
ideal
template
presented
to
students.
I
wonder
if
good
grammar
is
all
that
it's
worked
up
to
be.
Maybe
I'm
just
ranting
because
of
all
the
pressure
to
get
good
grades
and
thus
to
conform
to
whatever
professors
want.
Whatever.
At
least
I've
learned
that
I
enjoy
talking
about
writing,
and
no
matter
how
wrong
my
opinions
are,
I
can
look
forward
to
possibly
being
enlightened
if
I
stay
the
course.
Until
then,
I'll
just
wallow
in
my
confusion
and
take
pride
that
I've
outgrown
my
complacency
with
conformity.
My
writing
has
become
a
teenager.
