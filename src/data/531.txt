Writing

Literacy

August,
2007
Looking
Back
I
often
hear
students
reminisce
about
their
initial
experiences
in
school
while
growing
up.
I
guess
that
people
are
able
to
remember
more
memories
from
their
adolescent
years
as
soon
as
they
are
able
to
begin
recording
them.
Though
I
do
not
remember
much
about
my
very
first
experiences
with
writing,
I
do
recall
all
my
teachers
throughout
school
explaining
its
significance.
Beginning
in
elementary
school,
teachers
repeatedly
stressed
the
importance
of
good
hand-writing
and
learning
to
write
in
cursive
correctly.
Though
this
was
only
the
beginning,
learning
these
skills
would
help
lay
the
foundation
for
future
writing
improvement.
I
recall
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
me
that
reading
and
writing
are
vital
skills
and
that
both
can
be
applied
to
all
aspects
of
oneOs
life.
Bike
riding
is
one
of
my
favorite
activities,
and
one
day
when
I
was
about
7
years
old
I
ran
out
into
the
garage
to
find
my
back
tire
flat.
My
Dad
instructed
me
to
read
the
little
sticker
on
my
bike
that
would
let
me
know
how
much
I
needed
to
fill
up
my
tire.
Underneath
those
instructions
I
noticed
that
there
was
also
red
ink
warning
riders
to
always
wear
a
helmet.
I
remember
thinking
to
myself,
NWhat
if
that
writing
had
not
been
present?
How
would
I
know
what
to
do
with
my
flat
tire?,
OR,
What
if
I
did
not
know
how
to
read
that
writing?
Perhaps
I
would
not
know
to
wear
a
helmet.O
I
realized
that
communication
through
written
words
is
extremely
useful
and
necessary
even
outside
the
classroom.
Prior
to
the
bike
incident,
when
I
first
began
writing
I
initially
thought
that
I
would
only
use
the
skill
in
my
English
classes.
I
quickly
learned,
however,
that
I
would
need
to
write
for
all
of
my
classes
including
ones
such
as
science
and
music.
In
science
class
my
teacher
would
ask
the
students
to
write
about
the
evolution
of
the
Earth
or
perhaps
various
life
science
topics,
and
in
Music
we
were
asked
to
look
up
information
on
famous
composers
like
Mozart
and
record
what
we
found.
In
English
I
distinctly
remember
having
monthly
book
reports
and
weekly
spelling
tests
which
I
really
enjoyed.
Following
English,
my
class
would
travel
to
the
computer
room
to
learn
about
word
processing.
When
I
was
first
introduced
to
the
PC
I
remember
thinking
that
it
resembled
a
robot
of
sorts,
taking
in
all
information
that
I
supplied
it
with.
The
screen
on
the
computer
could
even
produce
a
picture
with
the
help
of
a
NmouseO
and
the
program
NPaint.O
I
could
not
believe
it.
Soon
after
my
classmates
and
I
became
familiar
with
the
computer
I
realized
that
having
the
ability
to
type
made
writing
a
great
deal
easier
and
even
more
enjoyable.
For
a
little
while
I
did
not
even
understand
why
teachers
ever
made
us
hand-write
anything.
After
all,
many
students
did
not
have
very
neat
hand-writing
and
could
not
write
at
a
fast
pace.
However,
as
time
has
passed,
my
thoughts
have
changed.
Looking
back
now
as
a
college
student,
I
often
wish
teachers
had
required
all
students
to
turn
in
a
few
hand-written
papers
in
lieu
of
type-written
ones
so
that
they
could
practice
their
print.
I
have
noticed
that
many
students
at
Lafayette
as
well
as
friends
from
home
have
messy
and
incoherent
handwriting
as
a
result
of
a
lack
of
writing
practice.
I
also
remember
being
taught
about
the
different
genres
of
writing.
We
learned
about
expository
pieces
and
persuasive
writing
as
well
as
a
few
others.
When
I
think
back
to
elementary
and
middle
school,
the
types
of
writing
I
remember
practicing
were
mostly
personal
pieces,
such
as
essays
or
poems
about
family
members,
hobbies,
or
heroes/heroines.
I
also
remember
being
given
many
creative
writing
assignments,
where
the
topic
was
up
to
the
student
to
decide.
In
addition,
as
I
mentioned
earlier,
my
classmates
and
I
were
required
to
complete
monthly
book
reports
which
included
a
short
summary
of
the
story,
character
names,
and
a
substantial
personal
reaction
to
the
text.
I
thought
these
were
interesting
to
write
because
my
teacher
really
encouraged
the
students
to
react
honestly
about
what
they
thought.
For
example,
if
I
did
not
like
the
book
at
all,
I
was
able
to
say
so
and
explain
why
I
disliked
it.
As
I
moved
on
up
to
high
school,
teachers
started
assigning
essays
more
frequently.
In
some
classes
I
would
even
have
a
new
essay
due
each
week.
Instead
of
so
much
creative
writing
and
book
reporting,
we
were
assigned
data-based
questions
and
research
papers,
both
of
which
required
a
lot
more
outside
work
(research).
Although
the
writing
became
a
great
deal
more
difficult
as
I
moved
from
middle
school
to
high
school
and
then
to
college,
it
also
became
a
lot
more
interesting.
Now,
as
a
college
student,
I
am
often
given
the
freedom
to
choose
my
research
topics
and
to
incorporate
any
and
all
information
that
I
feel
is
important
in
supporting
my
thesis.
One
of
the
first
personal
writing
experiences
that
I
remember
from
elementary
school
was
writing
about
NThe
Perfect
Hero.O
My
classmates
and
I
were
instructed
to
make
a
list
of
a
handful
of
qualities
that
we
think
a
hero
possesses
and
to
then
explain
why
we
think
each
is
so
important.
The
qualities
I
chose
were
bravery,
loyalty,
honesty,
and
Nliving
up
to
the
golden
rule.O
The
hero
in
my
life
whom
I
chose
to
write
about
was
my
older
brother
Joe.
Since
the
assignment
was
a
creative
piece,
I
recalled
an
actual
event
where
my
brother
helped
me
to
safety.
I
was
only
four
years
old
climbing
on
the
monkey
bars
in
my
backyard
and
one
hand
had
slipped
off
so
I
was
barely
holding
on
with
the
other.
After
spotting
me
from
inside
the
house,
Joe
ran
out
into
the
backyard
and
stood
underneath
me
so
that
he
could
catch
me.
Such
a
simple
act
saved
me
from
injuring
myself
and
made
him
a
hero
in
my
mind.
I
happened
to
come
across
this
particular
essay
in
a
drawer
of
old
school
books
down
in
my
basement.
Looking
back
at
my
writing
now,
I
realize
that
I
made
a
lot
of
mistakes
when
I
was
young.
The
tenses
that
I
used
did
not
match
up
or
stay
consistent
throughout
the
paper
and
my
teacher
pointed
out
a
few
places
where
I
had
misplaced
modifiers.
I
also
used
certain
words
incorrectly,
and
in
one
sentence
where
I
meant
to
say
NJoe
is
honest
with
me,O
I
said,
NJoe
is
honest
to
me.O
However,
elementary
school
was
only
the
beginning
of
my
writing
career.
The
next
big
experience
with
writing
that
I
remember
occurred
in
sixth
grade,
and
my
essay
showed
a
great
deal
of
improvement
since
those
elementary
school
days.
Sixth
grade
was
the
start
of
something
very
new.
Not
only
was
I
in
middle
school,
and
in
a
different
building,
but
I
was
again
one
of
the
youngest
students
in
the
school
and
had
to
learn
to
adapt
to
a
changing
schedule
every
period
of
the
day.
Sixth
graders
were
also
required
to
go
through
the
D.A.R.E.
program
that
was
led
by
many
of
the
town
police
officers.
The
Drug
Abuse
Resistance
Education
program
was
designed
to
teach
kids
about
the
harms
and
consequences
of
using
drugs,
how
to
avoid
becoming
involved
with
them,
and
how
to
stay
away
from
gangs
and
violence.
At
the
end
of
the
program,
every
student
in
the
sixth
grade
was
required
to
write
an
essay.
At
this
point,
I
honestly
cannot
recall
the
topic
or
the
requirements
of
the
essay.
However,
two
students
out
of
the
entire
grade
were
chosen
to
read
their
essays
in
front
of
all
other
students,
faculty,
officers,
family,
and
friends
on
graduation
day
from
the
D.A.R.E.
program.
I
was
one
of
the
students
chosen
to
read
my
essay,
along
with
my
friend
Ben.
I
recall
being
extremely
pleased
that
I
was
chosen,
but
simultaneously
quite
terrified
to
have
to
read
my
personal
writing
in
front
of
over
400
people.
I
was
only
10
years
old,
and
at
that
age
I
did
not
even
like
letting
my
mother
or
father
read
my
writing,
let
alone
400
other
people
whom
I
was
only
partially
familiar
with.
But
then
I
persuaded
myself
that
I
had
done
something
right
since
my
essay
was
chosen,
and
it
had
all
stemmed
from
constant
repetition
and
writing
practice
in
each
of
my
classes.
The
D.A.R.E.
essay
and
speech
proved
to
remain
an
experience
that
I
will
not
soon
forget.
Though
I
will
never
forget
my
experiences
with
the
D.A.R.E.
program,
I
have
come
a
long
way
since
then.
As
I
transitioned
into
high
school
and
survived
my
freshmen
and
sophomore
years,
it
became
time
for
me
to
start
thinking
about
college.
I
was
only
sixteen
when
I
began
applying
to
schools
but
I
knew
that
it
was
very
important
and
that
I
needed
to
take
it
seriously.
As
a
part
of
all
of
the
long
applications
necessary
for
each
school,
a
personal
statement
was
required.
Talk
about
creative
writing.
A
personal
statement?
My
first
thoughts
were
NWhat
in
the
world
am
I
going
to
write
about
myself??O
So
my
Dad
gave
me
some
advice.
First
of
all,
he
said,
NMake
an
outline.
You
must
start
with
something.O
Then
he
told
me
that
a
good
piece
of
writing
does
not
state
the
obvious,
as
in
NMy
name
is
and
I
am
a
junior
at
so
and
so
schoolO
since
this
information
can
easily
be
found
on
the
front
page
of
my
application.
My
Dad
said,
NTell
them
something
interesting,
something
special,
something
that
they
donOt
already
know.O
It
took
me
a
long
time
to
formulate
my
first
draft
since
I
initially
did
not
know
where
to
start.
When
I
finally
spent
some
time
writing,
I
was
so
thrilled
to
actually
have
something
on
paper
that
I
did
not
even
write
a
conclusion
at
first.
I
quickly
printed
my
statement
out
and
proudly
handed
it
over
to
my
father
to
read,
thinking
in
my
head
that
it
was
very
good
writing.
Little
did
I
know
that
I
would
soon
have
to
make
countless
revisions
to
this
initial
copy.
My
Dad
made
many
different
comments
about
my
writing.
He
would
cross
out
an
entire
paragraph
that
I
did
not
need
or
that
did
not
support
my
thesis
and
tell
me
to
Ntighten
upO
certain
areas.
NMake
it
succinct,O
he
said.
NIt
is
important
to
be
concise.
When
the
paper
can
only
be
one
page,
do
not
drag
on
for
two
whole
paragraphs
about
one
specific
sentence.O
He
also
thought
that
some
sentences
were
too
wordy
and
thus
confusing
to
the
reader.
About
five
or
six
drafts
later,
I
was
told
that
my
personal
statement
was
finally
interesting
to
read
and
kept
the
readerOs
attention
throughout.
At
last
I
was
allowed
to
mail
it
off
with
my
application
to
the
colleges
on
my
list.
I
remember
sitting
down
to
breathe
after
all
of
my
applications
were
out,
thinking,
NSo
this
is
what
itOs
really
like
to
work
hard.
Those
book
reports
in
grade
school
were
a
piece
of
cake
compared
to
the
writing
I
am
expected
to
produce
now.O
I
recall
thinking
senior
year
of
high
school
that
I
had
already
come
so
far.
I
had
jumped
over
the
most
challenging
hurdles
of
all
which
were
college
applications
and
SATOs,
and
that
all
I
needed
now
was
to
be
accepted
to
a
good
school
and
then
my
life
would
be
easy
and
complete.
Well,
complete
maybe,
but
surely
not
any
easier.
I
was
so
thrilled
to
be
accepted
to
Lafayette
that
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
I
would
actually
have
to
continue
to
produce
writing
on
a
daily
basis
that
was
equivalent
to
the
writing
in
my
personal
statement.
Since
I
decided
to
major
in
English,
it
was
especially
necessary
that
I
be
able
to
communicate
well
and
express
my
thoughts
clearly.
My
first
year
came
and
went,
and
I
survived
all
writing
assignments
thinking
that
none
of
them
were
really
any
more
challenging
than
the
research
papers
I
wrote
during
senior
year
of
high
school.
However,
sophomore
year
came
along
and
I
was
enrolled
in
my
first
300
level
English
class
with
mostly
upperclassmen
and
I
was
truly
scared
for
the
first
time
since
that
sixth
grade
speech.
I
was
fearful
that
my
writing
would
just
not
cut
it
compared
to
the
other
students.
I
really
loved
the
class,
though,
despite
being
timid
at
first,
and
I
was
happy
to
see
that
my
grades
steadily
improved
throughout
the
semester.
The
semester
came
to
a
rapid
close
and
I
recall
that
my
final
paper
for
the
class
was
an
8-10
page
research
paper.
The
students
were
required
to
include
at
least
8
primary
sources
and
apply
our
chosen
topics
to
one
of
the
books
we
read
throughout
the
semester.
I
chose
to
use
Richard
Brinsley
SheridanOs
NThe
RivalsO
as
my
literary
piece
but
initially
could
not
think
of
a
specific
topic
to
write
about.
My
professor
suggested
that
I
research
dueling
in
18th
century
Britain
as
it
relates
to
SheridanOs
play.
At
first
I
thought
that
the
topic
would
be
too
narrow
and
that
I
would
not
find
much
research
about
it.
However,
after
a
great
deal
of
time
spent
in
the
library
and
online,
I
wound
up
using
approximately
thirteen
relevant
sources
and
my
paper
turned
out
very
well.
A
great
deal
has
changed
since
my
first
days
in
elementary
school
when
I
learned
how
to
hold
a
pencil
correctly
and
write
in
cursive.
The
one
thing,
however,
that
has
remained
constant
throughout
is
the
significance
and
utility
of
writing.
In
this
world
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
be
able
to
communicate
well
and
to
be
able
to
make
oneOs
objectives
clear.
Whether
a
person
is
in
the
classroom
writing
a
research
paper
or
simply
in
a
kitchen
reading
a
recipe
out
of
a
book,
having
the
ability
to
express
oneself
and
write
well
is
fundamental.
