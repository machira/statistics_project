My
History
as
a
Writer:
From
Childhood
to
Present
August
27,
1999
I
think
that
the
process
of
looking
back
on
my
accomplishments
as
a
writer
is
by
no
means
an
easy
task.
It
is
always
somewhat
awkward
to
reread
samples
of
my
writing
that
I
have
saved
from
both
the
high
school
and
college
level.
People
in
general,
myself
included,
tend
to
be
the
most
critical
of
themselves
when
they
reread
something
that
they
have
written
in
the
past.
The
task
of
reflecting
upon
and
describing
my
history
as
a
writer
is
not
only
challenging
for
this
reason,
but
also
because
it
is
difficult
to
recall
the
types
of
writing
and
specific
influences
I
experienced
as
a
young
girl
learning
the
skills
required
to
write
well.
I
believe
that
reading
is
one
of
the
best
ways
to
acquire
fine
tuned
writing
skills.
As
a
child,
my
parents
read
to
me
very
often,
and
as
a
result
I
learned
to
write
at
an
early
age.
At
the
age
of
three,
I
had
learned
to
write
simple
words
such
as
dog,
god,
cat,
mom,
dad,
and
my
own
name.
I
remember
feeling
extremely
proud
of
myself
and
as
if
I
had
somehow
gained
a
tremendous
amount
of
insight
from
this
newfound
knowledge.
This
opened
the
door
to
my
curiosity
and
I
longed
to
learn
how
to
write
more
and
more
words.
This
was
the
start
of
my
never
ending
and
always
improving
writing
career.
My
parents
and
older
sister
were
the
biggest
influences
in
my
life
when
I
was
growing
up.
Before
I
was
formally
taught
the
necessary
skills
for
writing,
I
practiced
using
my
limited
writing
abilities
by
making
cards
for
my
family.
I
drew
pictures
and
wrote
brief
descriptions
of
what
I
was
drawing.
I
loved
to
use
crayons
to
draw
with
as
a
little
girl,
but
for
the
most
part,
I
used
a
pencil
for
writing.
Like
most
children,
I
was
not
afraid
to
express
myself.
Even
though
I
was
not
very
artistic
nor
a
flawless
writer,
I
never
felt
intimated
or
ashamed
to
put
on
paper
whatever
my
heart
desired.
I
remember
asking
for
a
puppy
one
Christmas
when
I
was
a
little
girl.
Although
my
parents
were
not
in
favor
of
this
idea,
I
wrote
a
letter
to
them
asking
for
this
special
present.
My
letter
gave
numerous
(and
very
good)
reasons
why
I
felt
I
deserved
a
dog.
Even
though
I
was
not
successful
in
convincing
my
parents
to
buy
me
an
animal
that
almost
every
child
asks
for
at
least
once
in
his
life,
I
had
taken
the
initiative
to
use
persuasive
writing.
One
strong
memory
I
have
of
writing
as
a
child
is
the
fact
that
I
always
took
my
time
forming
my
letters.
By
the
time
I
entered
third
grade,
I
had
penmanship
that
was
praised
by
my
family
as
well
as
all
my
teachers.
Once
I
was
introduced
to
cursive
writing,
I
never
wanted
to
print
again.
However,
I
eventually
gave
up
with
writing
in
cursive
when
I
entered
middle
school
because
I
found
it
to
be
more
of
an
inconvenience.
High
school
also
brought
about
several
changes
in
my
writing
style.
For
the
first
time,
I
was
told
by
my
teachers
that
my
writing
assignments
had
to
be
typed.
This
presented
a
new
challenge
for
me
because
I
was
in
the
process
of
learning
how
to
type.
Beginning
in
ninth
grade,
a
computer
became
my
most
useful
writing
tool.
The
process
of
writing
a
rough
draft
became
much
easier
once
I
was
well
acquainted
with
my
computer.
I
simply
made
corrections
to
my
papers
as
I
was
typing.
One
of
the
things
that
sticks
in
my
mind
as
I
reflect
upon
my
writing
experiences
in
high
school
is
self-reflections.
Each
year,
as
the
school
year
came
to
a
close,
my
English
teachers
required
every
student
to
write
a
one
page
letter
analyzing
the
progress
we
made
as
writers
by
determining
if
we
met
our
beginning
year
goals.
We
were
also
required
to
submit
examples
of
our
best
writing
(from
several
subjects)
and
to
explain
how
our
writing
had
strengthened
over
the
year
but
also
the
areas
that
still
needed
improvement.
The
writing
samples
that
we
selected,
along
with
the
self-reflections,
were
placed
in
a
personal
writing
portfolio
that
followed
us
through
high
school.
For
me,
this
task
of
describing
my
strengths
and
weaknesses
as
a
writer
was
especially
difficult.
I
recognized
that
many
of
my
papers
lacked
a
strong
connection
between
my
introductions
and
conclusions.
I
usually
gave
enough
supporting
details
to
defend
my
thesis,
but
I
felt
I
could
improve
my
writing
by
strengthening
the
relationship
between
my
introductions
and
conclusions.
I
can
recall
being
assigned
my
first
real
research
paper
in
my
ninth
grade
English
class.
This
assignment
scared
me
for
several
reasons.
At
this
point
in
my
writing
career,
I
had
never
written
anything
longer
than
two
or
three
pages.
Now
I
was
being
asked
to
compose
a
coherent
and
well-researched
paper
of
at
least
five
pages.
I
was
given
the
freedom
to
choose
any
topic
that
interested
me,
yet
this
made
the
paper
that
much
more
challenging.
After
much
contemplation,
I
decided
to
write
about
Arthur
Ashe,
Jr.
(who
had
just
recently
passed
away)
because
of
my
intense
passion
for
the
game
of
tennis.
This
assignment
opened
my
eyes
to
an
element
of
a
paper
that
I
had
never
before
incorporated
into
my
writing,
but
today
is
something
I
use
in
almost
all
my
papers,
a
works
cited
page.
Probably
the
most
difficult
aspect
of
this
assignment
was
the
fact
that
my
teacher
insisted
upon
collecting
(and
grading)
each
part
of
the
process
along
the
way
to
the
final
copy.
First,
our
topic
and
thesis
statements
had
to
be
approved.
We
also
had
to
hand
in
note
cards
that
contained
the
information
that
we
had
researched
for
our
specific
topic.
I
remember
turning
in
two
outlines,
the
first
one
being
a
brief
overview
of
the
paper,
while
the
second
one
had
to
give
much
more
detailed
information.
A
rough
draft
(along
with
a
works
cited
page)
was
also
a
required
component
of
this
research
paper.
Although
this
assignment
was
a
new
challenge
for
me,
I
believe
it
gave
me
an
excellent
background
in
composing
a
research
paper.
I
put
every
effort
into
writing
the
best
paper
I
could
and
was
successful
in
my
eyes
as
well
as
my
teacher's.
Even
now
as
I
reread
my
ninth
grade
research
paper,
I
am
impressed
with
my
writing
ability
as
a
14
year
old.
I
received
an
A
(on
my
rough
draft
as
well
as
my
final
copy),
and
my
teacher
made
several
flattering
comments
at
the
end
of
my
paper.
She
concluded
by
saying
I
want
to
especially
commend
you
on
an
excellent
introduction
and
conclusion
as
well
as
your
transitions.
With
your
permission
I
would
like
to
make
a
copy
of
this
paper
as
a
model
of
the
research
paper.
I
felt
proud
that
I
accomplished
a
task
that
had
at
first
seemed
close
to
impossible.
I
think
that
this
was
probably
one
of
my
best
experiences
as
a
writer.
It
was
my
first
writing
sample
that
I
decided
to
put
in
my
personal
portfolio.
My
English
classes
did
not
present
much
of
a
problem
for
me
until
my
senior
year
of
high
school.
Through
my
junior
year
of
high
school,
all
my
teachers
had
liked
my
writing
style.
I
felt
prepared
for
anything
and
decided
to
take
AP
English
my
senior
year.
My
teacher
that
year
was
one
of
the
most
intelligent
people
I
have
ever
met.
He
not
only
challenged
me
inside
the
classroom
but
outside
as
well.
The
readings
we
were
required
to
do
were
difficult
and
lengthy.
We
read
such
works
as
The
Odvssev.
Tom
Jones.
Lord
Jim,
and
Hard
Times.
I
have
never
been
an
incredibly
fast
reader,
so
this
class
was
especially
trying
for
me.
This
was
the
first
year
I
was
not
given
weekly
vocabulary
tests
nor
was
I
asked
to
regurgitate
information
given
in
the
classroom.
Instead,
my
grade
was
based
on
several
in-class
essays
and
a
handful
of
compositions
that
were
thought
provoking
questions
to
be
answered
in
no
less
than
seven
well-organized
and
coherent
pages.
I
struggled
to
maintain
a
B
in
this
class.
The
biggest
challenge
for
me
in
this
class
were
the
two
research
papers
that
were
assigned
within
the
first
week
of
school.
We
were
required
to
write
two
20
page
in-depth
research
papers
on
a
specific
element
of
the
writing
style
of
an
author
of
our
choice
(pending
teacher
approval,
of
course).
We
were
given
a
semester
to
complete
each
research
paper.
In
addition
to
the
required
readings
for
the
class,
we
had
to
read
at
least
3
novels
by
the
author
we
chose
as
part
of
the
research
paper.
As
a
senior
in
high
school,
I
could
not
even
fathom
the
idea
of
writing
a
twenty
page
paper.
I
was
scared
that
I
was
in
over
my
head.
I
am
not
a
quitter
though,
and
I
refused
to
give
up.
I
wrote
my
first
research
paper
on
Jane
Austen
and
her
use
of
irony.
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
reading
her
novels,
and
amazingly
enough,
it
wasn't
as
difficult
as
I
imagined
it
would
be
to
write
twenty
pages
on
this
topic.
My
hard
work
and
dedication
paid
off
when
I
received
a
well-deserved
A-
on
my
paper.
I
was
not
only
a
successful
writer
in
my
English
classes,
but
also
in
my
Spanish
classes
(in
both
high
school
as
well
as
college.)
I
began
to
write
short
Spanish
compositions
in
tenth
grade.
One
assignment
that
I
believe
is
particularly
well
written
remains
in
my
personal
writing
portfolio.
I
was
given
the
task
of
writing
a
letter
to
describe
a
job
opening
that
needed
to
be
filled.
Although
the
topic
was
a
rather
simple
one,
I
think
I
did
a
very
thorough
job
of
making
use
of
my
Spanish
skills.
Even
during
my
first
stages
of
learning
to
write
in
Spanish,
I
enjoyed
expressing
myself
in
another
language.
It
is,
without
a
doubt,
more
difficult
for
me
to
write
in
Spanish
as
opposed
to
English,
but
my
desire
to
be
bilingual
encourages
me
to
always
give
it
my
best
effort.
Even
though
my
four
years
of
high
school
challenged
me
as
a
writer,
I
still
did
not
feel
adequately
prepared
for
college
writing.
I
was
not
confident
enough
of
my
writing
skills,
and
I
anticipated
the
expectations
to
be
much
higher
in
college
than
they
were
in
high
school.
My
First
Year
Seminar,
however,
did
not
confirm
these
fears.
I
was
very
successful
in
this
class,
and
although
the
class
challenged
me
to
become
a
better
writer,
I
think
my
senior
year
English
class
pushed
me
to
a
higher
level
of
writing
than
my
FYS
did.
Although
my
First
Year
Seminar
gave
me
more
confidence
as
a
writer,
that
confidence
was
all
taken
away
during
that
same
semester
as
I
struggled
with
my
writing
in
an
Ethics
class.
I
was
one
of
the
few
freshman
in
this
class,
and
I
had
never
before
taken
a
philosophy
class.
We
were
required
to
write
several
short
papers
(four
to
five
pages)
defending
or
arguing
against
(with
logical
support)
particular
philosophical
theories.
My
grades
on
these
papers
were
always
somewhere
in
the
B
range.
However,
it
wasn't
so
much
the
grade
that
bothered
me,
but
the
comments
my
professor
made
about
my
papers.
She
gave
lengthy,
detailed
corrections
to
many
parts
of
my
papers.
No
matter
how
hard
I
worked
on
a
paper,
I
always
felt
as
if
my
writing
was
lacking
a
crucial
element
that
I
myself
could
not
identify
but
that
my
professor
insisted
was
missing.
This
Ethics
class
was,
without
a
doubt,
one
of
my
most
frustrating
experiences
as
a
writer.
I
felt
very
confused
because,
on
the
one
hand,
my
First
Year
Seminar
professor
was
telling
me
that
he
enjoyed
my
writing
style
while,
on
the
other
hand,
the
professor
of
my
philosophy
class
was
not
as
pleased.
Fortunately,
I
was
able
to
redeem
myself
in
my
Ethics
class
on
the
final
paper.
I
wrote
several
rough
drafts
which
my
professor
proofread
in
order
to
help
me
identify
the
weakest
areas
of
my
paper.
I
believe
that
in
my
first
semester
of
college
I
had
both
good
and
bad
experiences
as
a
writer.
I
was
faced
with
the
challenge
of
two
very
different
types
of
writing.
My
First
Year
Seminar
required
me
to
comment
on
thematic
aspects
of
several
books,
while
my
philosophy
class
demanded
that
my
writing
include
supportive
philosophical
evidence
of
specific
theories.
The
ladder
was,
conceptually,
much
more
difficult
for
me
to
grasp
as
a
writer.
Although
I
faced
ups
and
downs
as
a
writer
in
college,
I
realize
now
that
my
experiences
with
writing
in
high
school
prepared
me
as
well,
if
not
better,
than
most
freshmen
entering
Lafayette
College.
I
can
recall
my
college
friends
saying
that
they
had
never
written
anything
longer
than
five
pages
and
had
no
idea
how
they
would
ever
compose
an
eight
to
ten
page
paper.
Due
to
my
writing
experiences
in
high
school,
I
felt
fairly
confident
in
my
ability
to
write
a
paper
of
this
length.
The
one
form
of
writing
that
I
have
always
lacked
confidence
in
is
creative
expression.
I
consider
myself
a
very
organized
and
logical
person,
and
I
wince
every
time
I
hear
a
professor
assign
a
paper
that
requires
the
use
of
the
creative
side
of
my
brain.
Although
I
have
not
written
many
creative
pieces,
there
is
one
particular
instance
when
I
was
given
a
creative
assignment
that
I
dreaded
writing,
yet
ended
up
being
one
of
the
most
fun
assignments
I
have
ever
completed.
I
encountered
this
unwanted
task
during
my
First
Year
Writing
class.
My
assignment
was
to
add
a
chapter
to
the
novel
Frankenstein
that
would
alter
a
major
event
or
decision
in
the
book,
but
show
that,
ultimately,
the
ending
would
not
be
modified
in
any
way.
I
contemplated
long
and
hard
about
what
I
wanted
my
chapter
to
accomplish,
and
once
I
had
an
idea
in
mind,
my
thoughts
flowed
freely.
I
honestly
enjoyed
incorporating
dialogue
into
my
writing
and
found
myself
taking
pleasure
in
the
fact
that
I
alone
had
the
ability
to
control
what
would
happen
to
the
characters.
My
First
Year
Writing
class
focused
heavily
on
peer
editing,
revising,
and
writing
many
drafts
of
one
paper.
In
high
school,
I
had
become
accustomed
to
writing
only
one
draft
of
a
paper.
It
was
quite
a
challenge
to
spend
three
or
four
weeks
revising
the
same
paper.
I
was
easily
frustrated
with
the
process
of
drastically
changing
what
I
wrote.
Although
at
times
I
viewed
this
process
as
unnecessary,
in
hindsight
I
believe
it
was
very
beneficial
for
me
as
a
writer.
I
felt
as
if
I
were
relearning
the
process
of
writing
a
rough
draft
and
allowing
myself
to
step
back
and
critically
judge
what
I
had
written.
I
also
found
myself
struggling
with
the
concept
of
peer
editing.
I
was
not
particularly
fond
of
the
idea
of
having
other
students
read
and
constructively
criticize
my
writing.
Although
it
made
me
feel
a
little
uncomfortable
to
share
my
writing,
I
know
that
there
is
always
something
to
gain
by
listening
to
what
others
have
to
say
about
my
writing.
My
experiences
as
a
writer
have
been,
at
times,
overwhelming
and
challenging,
but
they
have
given
me
more
confidence
in
my
writing
skills
and
allowed
me
to
express
myself
in
many
different
ways.
Writing
has
not
only
taught
me
how
to
put
my
thoughts
down
in
an
organized
and
coherent
manner,
but
it
has
also
given
me
the
ability
to
add
feeling
to
what
I
want
my
reader
to
understand.
Each
person
has
a
unique
history
as
a
writer,
and
each
experience
brings
about
new
lessons
that
will
hopefully
not
be
easily
forgotten.
For
me,
writing
is
a
never
ending
process
that
will
most
likely
be
with
me
throughout
my
entire
life.
I
have
never
really
thought
of
myself
as
a
good
writer,
but
this
paper
has
helped
to
show
me
that
my
writing
has
improved
over
the
years
and
with
each
new
experience
I
am
gaining
more
knowledge.
