My
Life
in
Writing
From
the
outside
looking
in
on
my
present
academic
career,
one
sees
a
student
of
engineering
not
liberal
arts,
math
not
English,
logic
not
creativity.
However,
this
is
not
all
that
I
do
now,
and
it
is
not
where
I
began
my
academic
career
long
ago.
When
I
was
very
young
I
envisioned
myself
someday
as
a
creative
genius.
I
knew
that
someday
I
was
going
to
write
the
most
popular
books
of
all
time.
What
I
didnOt
know
then
was
that
this
was
not
where
all
of
my
true
talents
lay.
Throughout
the
years
I
began
to
enjoy
all
forms
of
writing
less
and
less
as
I
was
drawn
to
the
logical
thought
of
math
and
the
sciences
where
I
excelled
with
less
effort.
It
has
only
been
a
few
years
since
I
have
reconnected
with
my
love
of
writing.
Early
in
kindergarten
many
school
projects
focused
on
producing
visual
representations
of
ideas
through
artwork.
I
soon
came
to
the
realization
that
I
had
very
little
talent
as
an
artist
and
therefore
became
frustrated
when
I
couldnOt
express
my
ideas
with
beautiful
artwork
as
they
deserved.
We
were
then
gradually
taught
the
art
of
writing
and
how
to
express
our
ideas
in
that
manner
as
well.
I
found
that
my
talents
were
better
suited
to
this
form
of
expression.
As
our
assignments
progressed
away
from
art
and
began
to
include
more
and
more
writing,
I
began
to
feel
more
confident
and
proud
of
the
work
I
was
producing.
I
enjoyed
writing
so
much
that
while
other
children
would
draw
large
elaborate
pictures
for
an
assignment
and
add
only
a
short
sentence
as
description,
I
would
instead
draw
only
a
small
simple
picture
and
fill
up
the
rest
of
the
page
front
and
back
with
writing.
As
I
went
through
the
first
few
years
of
elementary
school,
I
continued
to
enjoy
writing
in
school,
mainly
because
this
was
a
subject
in
which
I
was
excelling.
At
home,
I
would
stay
up
late
on
weekends
reading
book
after
book.
With
each
one
I
finished,
I
thought
about
the
books
I
would
write
someday
myself.
However,
I
didnOt
try
to
write
them
yet.
I
found
that
I
was
unable
to
create
any
stories
in
my
own
head
that
would
compare
to
those
in
the
books
I
was
reading.
I
assumed
that
this
was
an
ability
that
I
would
simply
have
all
of
the
sudden
one
day.
I
stuck
to
the
writing
which
I
was
given
in
school,
assignments
from
the
teacher
where
I
was
given
a
specific
topic
or
question.
I
found
that
once
I
was
given
a
topic
I
could
expand
on
it
easily
and,
after
a
little
work,
turn
in
beautifully
written
responses.
Because
I
was
receiving
good
grades
and
praise
from
my
teachers
I
was
pleased
with
my
ability
as
a
writer.
As
elementary
school
continued
I
began
to
see
that
I
was
actually
more
talented
in
the
subjects
of
math
and
science
than
in
English.
This
became
especially
obvious
to
me
in
the
fifth
grade
when
I
was
asked
to
write
an
autobiography.
It
was
the
first
writing
assignment
of
any
great
length
that
I
had
been
given,
as
well
as
the
first
assignment
I
had
to
produce
with
a
computer.
This
was
one
of
the
most
important
projects
of
the
year,
and
we
were
given
time
in
the
computer
lab
at
school
each
week
for
two
months
to
finish
it.
We
were
asked
to
write
at
least
one
page
for
each
year
in
our
lives
up
to
that
point,
ten
years
for
me
at
the
time.
I
was
able
to
accomplish
this
part
of
the
assignment
quickly.
I
simply
wrote
a
record
of
the
most
important
events
of
each
year.
The
second
part
of
the
assignment,
however,
created
much
more
trouble
for
me.
In
this
part
we
were
asked
to
create
four
more
entries
into
our
autobiography,
one
for
what
we
would
do
in
middle
school,
one
for
what
we
would
do
in
high
school,
and
the
last
two
what
we
would
have
accomplished
by
the
time
we
turned
25
and
40.
This
was
the
first
time
that
I
was
asked
to
create
writing
about
something
that
had
not
happened
yet.
Up
until
this
point
my
writing
assignments
had
been
about
experiences
in
my
own
life,
things
I
had
studied
in
school,
or
books
I
had
read.
I
found
that
I
had
a
lot
of
trouble
creating
my
own
ideas.
Each
time
I
would
write
something
I
would
find
that
I
was
not
happy
with
it.
I
would
erase
it
and
begin
again.
Eventually
I
was
able
to
finish
the
project;
however,
I
was
never
fully
satisfied
with
what
I
had
produced.
This
was
the
first
time
I
had
felt
unconfident
with
my
writing
ability.
Because
this
was
the
same
time
in
my
life
that
I
began
to
excel
in
math
and
science,
I
decided
that
was
where
all
of
my
strengths
lay.
As
I
continued
to
doubt
my
writing
ability,
I
was
unable
to
build
my
skills
in
that
area.
It
was
easier
to
just
tell
myself
that
I
was
not
a
good
writer
and
would
never
be
than
to
accept
the
fact
that
it
was
simply
an
area
where
I
needed
to
put
in
a
little
bit
more
work
than
others
to
excel.
As
I
moved
through
middle
school
I
continued
to
doubt
my
ability
as
a
writer.
I
was
getting
decent
grades
in
honors
English
classes,
but
I
knew
that
my
writing
was
only
average
when
compared
to
others
in
the
same
class.
I
told
myself
that
the
writing
I
was
creating
at
the
time
was
the
best
I
could
do,
and
that
my
strengths
lay
elsewhere.
I
didnOt
put
any
extra
effort
into
any
of
my
writing
assignments
than
was
required.
I
felt
that
all
I
needed
to
do
was
just
get
through
the
classes
with
decent
grades.
What
I
didnOt
realize
was
that
without
any
additional
effort
from
one
paper
to
the
next
my
writing
would
never
improve.
My
writing
ability
was
not
set
in
stone;
it
was
something
that
I
could
continuously
improve
through
experience
and
hard
work.
During
this
time
in
my
education,
I
was
given
many
different
types
of
writing
assignments
for
many
different
courses:
English,
history,
even
science.
These
assignments
were
all
different
types:
literary
commentaries,
historical
accounts,
opinion
and
research
papers,
and
lab
reports.
I
viewed
these
writing
assignments
as
something
that
had
to
be
done,
but
I
didnOt
feel
that
I
was
learning
something
each
time
I
wrote
like
I
did
each
time
I
solved
a
problem
in
math
class.
Because
of
this
point
of
view,
each
time
I
was
given
an
assignment
I
would
simply
write
what
I
had
to
say
and
turn
it
in.
I
know
that
each
time
an
assignment
was
returned
to
me
the
teacher
had
made
corrections
and
written
suggestions
for
improvements,
however,
the
only
mark
on
the
paper
I
was
interested
in
was
the
grade.
Once
I
saw
that
I
had
received
an
A
or
even
a
B
on
a
paper
I
was
satisfied.
I
put
the
paper
away
and
never
looked
at
it
again.
Because
I
knew
that
once
I
turned
in
a
paper,
I
wouldnOt
have
to
use
the
same
topic
again
I
felt
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
suggestions
my
teacher
had
made
that
would
help
me
in
the
future.
I
know
now
that
this
is
not
true.
If
I
had
read
the
suggestions
on
one
paper
and
saw
where
changes
could
have
been
made,
perhaps
I
would
have
changed
the
manner
in
which
I
wrote
papers
in
the
future.
Perhaps
I
would
have
earned
better
grades,
but
I
know
that
I
would
have
been
improving
my
writing
ability
in
general.
Without
making
any
changes,
I
continued
to
make
the
same
basic
mistakes
over
and
over
again.
If
I
would
have
changed
these
basic
faults
in
my
writing
I
would
have
been
able
to
move
on
to
improving
more
specific
elements
of
my
writing
style
that
had
never
been
addressed
before.
It
wasnOt
until
a
course
sophomore
year
in
high
school
that
I
began
to
see
the
value
of
continuous
writing
improvement.
In
general,
my
school
district
emphasized
math
and
natural
science
courses.
There
was
a
highly
competitive
math-science
combination
course
of
study,
but
there
was
nothing
like
this
for
courses
in
English
or
social
sciences.
Therefore,
most
students,
including
myself,
saw
math
and
science
as
more
important
than
other
courses.
There
was
one
teacher
in
the
English
department
who
felt
differently.
In
my
sophomore
year,
he
began
a
half-
year
course
called
Public
Speaking
and
Writing.
The
only
reason
that
I
signed
up
for
the
course
was
because
I
had
a
half-year
open
spot
in
my
schedule
and
a
guidance
counselor
convinced
me
that
it
would
be
more
beneficial
for
me
in
the
future
than
taking
a
home-economics
or
gym
class,
my
only
other
choices.
I
had
no
idea
what
the
focus
of
the
class
would
be.
It
turned
out
that
the
teacher
was
upset
that
students
in
our
school
were
not
taking
writing
seriously
and
had
not
been
given
challenging
writing
assignments
through
the
years.
On
the
first
day
of
class
he
told
us
that
our
assignments
would
cover
all
types
of
writing,
including
poetry,
something
I
had
never
done
before.
I
figured
that
because
this
was
only
a
half-year
course
it
was
going
to
be
easy,
but
I
was
wrong.
The
class
was
the
most
challenging
I
encountered
throughout
my
whole
high-school
career.
It
was
the
only
class
where
I
had
ever
been
forced
to
produce
creative
writing
samples,
not
states
facts
or
opinions.
At
first
I
was
very
uncomfortable
with
this
style
of
writing.
I
thought
that
I
was
simply
unable
to
do
it
and
I
told
the
professor
so.
He
told
me
that
just
because
it
wasnOt
something
that
came
easy
for
me,
didnOt
mean
that
it
was
something
I
would
never
be
able
to
do.
He
told
me
that
I
would
have
to
try
my
best
on
every
assignment,
put
a
lot
of
effort
and
time
into
each
assignment
and
turn
in
whatever
I
ended
up
with
even
if
I
didnOt
think
it
was
very
good.
Then
after
each
assignment
instead
of
writing
only
suggestions
of
the
paper
he
spoke
with
me
about
the
assignment,
told
me
where
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
were
and
how
it
could
be
improved.
This
forced
me,
for
the
first
time,
to
see
where
I
could
improve
my
writing.
Once
I
saw
my
mistakes
on
past
papers,
it
was
easier
to
avoid
making
them
again.
I
saw
then
how
by
seeing
each
assignment
in
the
past
singularly,
I
was
not
improving
as
a
writer
at
all.
During
this
one
half-year
course
my
writing
improved
more
than
it
had
in
all
of
the
time
since
elementary
school
when
I
first
began
to
doubt
myself.
The
challenging
assignments
of
the
class
that
put
me
outside
of
my
comfort
area,
allowed
me
to
see
my
potential
for
the
first
time.
Throughout
the
rest
of
high
school
I
continued
to
excel
in
math
and
science
courses
more
than
I
did
in
English.
However,
I
had
gained
confidence
in
my
writing
ability.
I
knew
that
by
spending
more
time
assessing
and
writing
each
assignment
I
could
turn
in
my
best
work,
and
that
the
suggestions
on
each
returned
paper
were
for
my
benefit,
not
simply
grades
given
to
me
by
the
teacher.
After
each
paper
I
wrote
I
would
write
down
my
mistakes
so
that
the
next
time
I
was
sure
to
check
and
make
sure
that
I
had
not
made
them
again.
I
graduated
from
high
school
and
decided
to
pursue
an
engineering
major
in
college.
I
felt
that
I
was
prepared
for
the
writing
challenges
that
I
would
face
at
college,
mainly
because
I
felt
that
as
an
engineer
there
wouldnOt
be
many
challenges.
I
also
knew
that
I
wouldnOt
have
been
prepared
at
all
if
it
hadnOt
been
for
the
Public
Speaking
and
Writing
class
that
I
had
taken
senior
year.
In
my
first
two
years
at
Lafayette
I
have
found
that
as
an
engineer
I
do
in
fact
have
less
writing
assignments
than
other
liberal
arts
majors.
One
semester
I
only
had
one
major
writing
assignment
in
all
of
my
classes
together.
However,
I
have
had
more
than
I
initially
expected.
In
particular
the
classes
that
required
the
most
writing
were
my
FYS
class,
Cooking
Culture
and
Cinema,
and
ES225:
Engineering
Professionalism
and
Ethics,
my
VAST
course
as
an
engineer.
The
FYS
course
once
again
challenged
me
with
creative
writing
assignments,
as
well
as
restaurant
reviews
and
a
research
paper.
Because
this
was
my
first
college
writing
course
different
components
of
my
writing
were
brought
to
my
attention
for
the
first
time
by
both
the
WA
I
met
with
and
my
professor,
specifically
the
organization
and
structure
of
my
writing
as
a
whole.
This
was
something
that
I
can
say
I
never
considered
intensively
when
writing
in
high-school.
The
VAST
course
was
the
first
time
that
I
was
instructed
how
to
correctly
write
technical
papers,
something
that
I
know
I
will
use
in
the
future.
Now,
looking
back
on
my
career
as
a
writer
as
a
whole,
I
can
see
that
I
have
consistently
improved
since
the
beginning
of
high-school
when
I
first
saw
the
importance
of
writing
to
my
education
and
knowledge
as
a
whole.
I
can
also
see
when
and
where
I
made
significant
changes
and
improvements,
especially
in
individual
courses
at
Lafayette.
I
feel
that
I
am
unique
among
engineers,
because
I
see
the
value
and
importance
of
writing
and
improving
my
ability
when
many
others
see
it
as
only
a
chore.
I
can
only
hope
that
I
will
continue
to
change
and
make
improvements
during
my
final
years
at
Lafayette
and
beyond.
