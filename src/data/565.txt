Literacy
Narrative
In
psychology,
a
personOs
past
is
of
extreme
importance.
In
order
to
understand
a
personOs
behavior,
thoughts
and
emotions
one
must
understand
that
personOs
childhood,
upbringing,
past
experiences,
and
influences
that
have
shaped
these
attributes.
An
intense
and
irrational
fear
of
spiders
may
be
explained
by
a
nasty
childhood
spider
bite;
a
terrible
case
of
anorexia
might
be
related
to
overbearing
parenting
or
excessive
exposure
to
overly
thin
media
figures.
At
the
same
time,
however,
some
psychological
conditions
have
no
relevance
to
a
personOs
past;
instead,
they
are
inherent
in
the
genes
or
personality
of
the
person.
Most
psychologists
agree
that
a
personOs
psychological
state
is
a
mixture
of
nature
and
nurture
D
the
personOs
genetic
traits
as
well
as
his
or
her
past.
Similarly,
although
a
personOs
writing
style
is
unique
and
stems
from
his
or
her
own
innate
characteristics,
experiences
in
a
personOs
life
can
influence
how
he
or
she
uses
their
abilities
and
develops
their
style.
A
personOs
writing
history
can
give
many
insights
into
how
his
or
her
writing
style
has
been
molded
into
a
more
mature
voice.
Personally
my
writing
has
been
influenced
by
a
number
of
significant
experiences
that
either
directly
or
indirectly
shaped
how
I
write.
Writing
in
elementary
school
was
unmemorable
for
me.
I
did,
however,
soon
develop
a
love
for
the
writing
of
others.
I
was
never
without
a
book
in
my
hands.
I
learned
quickly
the
amazing
powers
of
writing
as
I
delved
into
many
adventures
scripted
by
other
authors.
I
came
to
see
books
as
ways
to
create
other
worlds,
other
universes.
It
fueled
a
creative
fire
in
me
as
I
began
to
imagine
my
own
worlds
far
removed
from
this
one.
Although
I
was
too
young
to
realize
it,
I
gained
an
understanding
of
sentence
structure,
I
learned
how
to
notice
and
express
detail,
and
I
discovered
a
multitude
of
new
vocabulary.
These
skills
were
very
useful
in
my
early
writing
experiences.
The
first
actual
writing
I
recall
doing
is
in
third
grade
when
the
teacher
had
us
author
our
own
books.
My
book
was
about
Rose
the
slave
girl
and
her
escape.
The
illustrations
were
ghastly,
but
I
am
sure
it
was
alright,
as
far
as
books
written
by
third-graders
go.
However,
as
soon
as
I
was
done
with
it
I
became
extremely
embarrassed
by
it.
Other
kids
were
writing
about
amazing
pianos
and
brave
dogs,
and
my
little
book
told
a
much
darker
story.
I
felt
like
my
teacher
would
think
I
was
reveling
in
the
despicable
horrors
of
slavery.
While
it
seems
irrational
in
retrospect,
as
soon
as
my
book
was
handed
in,
I
regretted
it
and
wished
I
had
chosen
another
topic.
After
that,
I
always
carefully
chose
a
topic
that
I
felt
was
appropriate
for
my
reader.
In
fifth
grade
I
was
lucky
enough
to
be
selected
for
the
NYoung
PlaywrightsO
program
at
my
school.
Young
Playwrights
was
a
program
where
twenty
young
students
worked
with
an
actual
playwright
for
two
weeks,
culminating
in
a
performance
of
the
plays
for
the
parents
at
the
end
of
the
program.
We
created
a
few
different
plays
and
all
of
the
other
kids
picked
one
of
those
as
the
ones
used
in
the
final
performance.
I
felt
inspired,
however,
and
created
my
own
off-topic
play
to
be
used.
It
was
a
version
of
Cinderella
and
IOm
sure
it
was
fine.
For
some
reason,
however,
the
emotion
I
remember
from
the
experience
was
acute
embarrassment.
The
idea
of
my
classmates
acting
out
my
play
for
my
parents
made
me
extremely
uncomfortable.
Up
until
that
point,
my
writing
experiences
had
been
very
personal
and
the
idea
of
sharing
in
such
a
prominent
manner
was
not
a
pleasant
one
for
me.
I
did
not
have
a
lot
of
faith
in
my
natural
writing
abilities
and
had
not
yet
developed
confidence
in
my
writing.
In
middle
school,
writing
became
a
much
more
prominent
aspect
of
my
schooling.
Spelling
and
grammar
became
important
and
suddenly
there
were
rules
and
guidelines
to
writing
properly.
Luckily,
my
love
for
reading
gave
me
an
innate
sense
of
what
Nsounded
rightO
and
these
things
came
relatively
easy
for
me.
However,
writing
in
middle
school
was
probably
more
boring
than
at
any
other
time.
The
unbridled
creativity
of
my
younger
days
was
being
checked
by
the
stricter
rules,
but
the
analytical
thinking
and
smooth
flow
that
I
would
later
develop
had
not
yet
surfaced.
In
eighth
grade
I
had
an
inspiring
teacher,
Mr.
Parent,
who
brought
back
a
lot
of
the
fun
to
writing
again.
He
assigned
a
lot
of
independent
reading
and
writing
which
encouraged
me
to
think
critically
about
otherOs
writing
as
well
as
my
own.
He
gave
the
class
a
list
of
books
to
read
which
included
Lake
Woebegon,
Dave
BarryOs
Big
Trouble
and
A
Clockwork
Orange.
One
of
the
best
papers
I
have
ever
written
was
a
review
of
The
Electric
Kool-Aid
Acid
Test
by
Tom
Wolfe.
I
hated
the
book
and
wrote
an
extremely
bashing
paper
which
I
was
then
afraid
to
hand
in.
Luckily
I
received
a
good
grade
on
it,
and
I
felt
proud
that
I
had
taken
a
strong
stand
on
something.
Mr.
Parent
also
gave
the
class
a
variety
of
different
writing
assignments.
We
had
to
write
about
a
recent
memorable
conversation,
misconceptions
others
had
about
us,
and
significant
experiences
in
our
lives.
Another
topic
we
wrote
about
involved
a
time
we
felt
betrayed.
For
this
assignment,
I
wrote
about
how
betrayed
I
had
felt
when
I
was
forced
to
quit
roller
skating,
a
sport
I
had
taken
part
of
for
many
years.
Mr.
Parent
was
impressed
and
asked
me
to
read
my
paper
in
front
of
the
class.
Of
course,
this
was
very
surprising
to
me.
I
had
never
had
much
confidence
in
my
writing
and
the
idea
that
my
professor
thought
my
paper
was
good
enough
to
ask
me
to
share
it
with
the
entire
class
gave
me
a
positive
light
with
which
to
view
my
writing.
My
teacher
also
encouraged
my
class
to
engage
in
creative
writing
as
well.
He
gave
us
a
variety
of
prompts
to
respond
to.
We
wrote
in
the
perspective
of
an
animal
and
about
a
dark
and
stormy
night.
We
even
had
to
write
about
our
own
death.
These
assignments
encouraged
me
to
think
in
new
ways.
I
got
a
new
rush
of
creativity
and
began
to
author
my
own
works.
However,
I
found
the
job
to
be
difficult
and
too
painstaking.
The
ideas
in
my
head
came
and
went
too
quickly
for
me
to
be
able
to
get
them
down.
I
would
sit
down
to
write
and
then
realize,
twenty
minutes
later,
that
I
had
been
staring
at
a
blank
computer
screen
as
my
characters
followed
detailed
plot
lines
in
my
head.
In
high
school
I
was
lucky
enough
to
have
many
instructive
science
teachers.
Learning
to
write
labs
was
a
very
slow
and
arduous
process
for
me.
While
it
seems
obvious
now,
learning
about
making
every
detail
of
an
experiment
reproducible
and
clear
to
another
researcher
was
difficult
for
me.
I
felt
that
the
endless
recounting
of
every
little
movement
was
redundant
and
tiresome.
Learning
to
write
a
lab
that
contained
all
the
details
seemed
both
impossible
and
ridiculous.
It
was
only
recently
that
I
grasped
all
of
the
intricacies
of
making
scientific
research
valid
and
reliable.
Even
though
I
may
not
have
fully
grasped
it
at
the
time,
however,
my
teachers
gave
me
a
good
background
in
this
kind
of
writing.
Luckily
I
was
able
to
apply
their
NformulasO
to
successful
lab
writing
even
though
I
may
not
have
understood
the
how
or
why
behind
the
endless
details
at
the
time.
In
eleventh
grade
something
completely
unrelated
occurred
that
ended
up
affecting
my
writing
in
an
unforeseen
way.
I
met
a
young
man
who
lived
in
Maryland,
a
six
hour
drive
from
my
home
in
northern
New
Jersey.
We
began
a
relationship
that,
due
to
distance,
was
carried
out
mostly
over
instant
messenger.
While
I
learned
a
lot
about
relationships
and
life
because
of
this
experience,
it
also
opened
up
a
new
dimension
of
writing
to
me.
Hours
of
conversation
were
communicated
through
writing
instead
of
speech.
With
the
absence
of
physical
presence
and
body
language,
communicating
takes
on
a
whole
new
dimension
and
I
constantly
had
to
think
about
what
I
was
saying
from
the
other
personOs
point
of
view.
I
developed
an
internal
check
that
regulated
my
words
to
make
sure
I
was
clear
and
descriptive.
Misunderstandings
were
very
common
in
the
beginning
but
as
we
both
developed
a
new
tone
soon
we
became
very
adept
at
this
kind
of
communication.
Though
the
relationship
ended
a
long
while
ago
and
I
have
happily
moved
on,
I
still
retain
the
critical
aspect
of
writing
and
I
think
my
ability
to
connect
with
a
reader
is
better
because
of
it.
Finally
in
my
senior
year
of
high
school
I
had
another
inspiring
teacher
for
AP
Literature.
I
had
already
taken
AP
Language
in
my
junior
year
and
had
done
well
on
the
test,
although
I
was
looking
forward
to
this
class
more
because
it
seemed
more
interesting
to
me.
My
teacher,
Mrs.
Klebez,
was
all
that
I
could
have
hoped
for.
She
was
determined
to
expose
my
class
to
as
many
different
things
as
possible.
We
read
everything
from
Oedipus
Rex
(we
had
a
toga
party)
to
Shakespeare
to
Their
Eyes
Were
Watching
God.
I
learned
a
lot
about
analyzing
literature
and
poetry,
something
I
had
been
trying
to
do
since
I
was
young.
I
learned
how
to
interpret
and
analyze
what
I
was
reading
as
well
as
write
successfully
about
it.
I
did
very
well
and
Mrs.
Klebez
was
very
supportive.
At
the
end
of
the
year
she
had
us
write
an
introspective
narrative,
where
we
examined
our
own
internal
morals,
views
and
opinions.
I
wanted
to
make
mine
unique
and
I
finally
decided
to
use
quotes
from
my
favorite
author,
Terry
Pratchett.
Terry
Pratchett
is
a
British
author
who
writes
satirical,
humorous
novels
about
the
Discworld,
a
world
that
is
very
similar
to
our
own.
I
have
read
a
lot
of
books
in
my
life
but
the
wit
and
wisdom
of
PratchettOs
books
struck
me
from
the
very
first
time
I
read
them.
I
was
able
to
find
a
quote
that
represented
my
views
on
everything
from
learning
to
love
to
religion
very
easily.
I
was
extremely
proud
of
my
paper
and
I
really
appreciated
the
opportunity
to
write
it
because
I
learned
a
lot
about
myself.
Writing
down
my
feelings
and
thoughts
helped
to
me
examine
them
more
thoroughly
and
I
gained
a
new
depth
to
my
writing.
When
I
came
to
college
I
was
very
unsure
about
my
writing
ability.
I
knew
that
in
high
school
I
had
done
well
in
all
my
classes,
received
a
lot
of
encouragement
from
my
teachers,
and
had
performed
well
on
the
standardized
tests.
Yet
some
of
those
old
doubts
began
to
creep
in
as
I
realized
that
I
was
now
among
other
students
who
had
all
also
done
well
in
all
of
their
classes,
received
a
lot
of
encouragement
from
their
teachers,
and
performed
well
on
the
standardized
tests.
I
wasnOt
sure
that
my
writing
would
be
up
to
par
with
that
of
the
other
kids.
I
was
especially
grateful
for
the
opportunities
that
my
First
Year
Seminar
and
First
Year
Seminar
professor
gave
me.
My
FYS
professor
allowed
us
to
hand
in
all
of
our
papers
twice,
so
that
we
could
receive
some
feedback
before
we
received
our
grade.
In
this
manner
I
began
to
understand
both
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
my
writing.
I
learned
that
I
had
good
ideas
and
creative
thoughts,
but
that
I
had
to
learn
to
support
them
and
provide
more
substance.
Once
again,
the
stories
in
my
head
were
running
away
with
me
before
I
could
get
them
down
on
paper!
It
seemed
to
be
a
recurring
theme
in
my
life
that
writing
is
too
slow
and
difficult
to
keep
up
with
my
ideas.
Very
often,
I
became
frustrated
(and
still
do)
as
I
tried
to
get
everything
out
and
make
the
reader
understand
what
I
meant.
I
understood
the
concept
of
a
thesis
and
supporting
it
throughout
the
paper,
but
in
high
school
I
never
really
structured
my
papers
that
way,
simply
sitting
down
and
writing
as
ideas
popped
into
my
head
and
hoping
that
the
resulting
paper
would
have
some
kind
of
coherence
and
structure.
When
I
got
to
college,
I
realized
that
this
was
not
going
to
cut
it.
I
had
the
ideas
D
and
they
were
good
ideasD
but
I
had
to
communicate
them
accurately
or
else
they
were
useless.
So
I
ended
up
revamping
my
whole
writing
style.
Instead
of
sitting
down
and
waiting
for
genius
to
strike,
I
had
to
actually
plan
out
my
papers
before
hand,
concentrating
on
one
main
idea
supported
by
several
more
detailed
ideas.
My
Values
of
Applied
Science
and
Technology
course
was
also
invaluable
in
helping
to
refine
my
writing
process.
I
had
never
been
a
big
fan
of
re-reading
and
editing
my
papers
in
high
school.
I
rarely
made
spelling
or
grammatical
mistakes
and
I
didnOt
really
know
what
other
use
proofreading
would
have.
My
VAST
professor
showed
me
how
to
re-read
my
papers
and
recognize
the
weak
spots
in
my
supporting
details
and
overall
paper
structure.
Now
I
consider
editing
to
be
an
extremely
important
part
of
my
writing
process.
My
studies
in
psychology
have
also
helped
me
to
advance
my
writing
in
terms
of
scientific
analysis.
Once
again,
Intro
to
Psych
lab
reports
seemed
like
pages
and
pages
of
meaningless
numbers,
useless
details
and
mumbo
jumbo.
However
as
I
began
to
understand
what
it
all
meant
and
what
information
each
component
conveyed,
I
also
began
to
realize
the
importance
of
the
lengthy,
detailed
report.
Not
only
that,
but
I
began
to
grasp
the
concepts
behind
design
and
analysis
in
psychology.
I
learned
how
to
read
and
analyze
the
works
of
others
and
spot
strong,
valid
research.
Like
any
piece
of
writing,
a
lab
report
exists
to
communicate
a
new
piece
of
knowledge
to
a
reader.
Only
by
including
all
of
the
necessary
supporting
details
can
that
be
successfully
accomplished.
In
conclusion,
there
have
been
two
main
themes
in
my
writing
history.
One
has
been
learning
to
appreciate
my
natural
abilities
and
skills
and
internalizing
that
my
writing
is
of
good
quality.
The
other
has
been
learning
that
writing
is
hard
work
and
requires
the
proper
nurturing
to
truly
develop
into
the
art
form
I
have
always
admired
from
others.
I
have
always
enjoyed
writing,
and
I
still
do
enjoy
it
very
much.
Now,
however,
I
feel
that
my
writing
has
matured
and
I
can
take
greater
satisfaction
in
my
finished
papers.
I
know
that
my
writing
has
come
a
long
way
and
that
it
still
has
a
long
way
to
go.
Writing
has
always
been
an
important
form
of
expression
for
me
and
looking
back
at
some
of
my
past
adventures
has
been
fun
and
enlightening.
Growing
as
a
writer
is
a
very
satisfying
experience.
