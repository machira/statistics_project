WA
summer
assignment
August
14,
2012
Since
the
first
day
of
kindergarten
I
have
excelled
in
academics.
When
I
was
in
first
grade,
sitting
in
Mineral
King
Stadium
watching
my
cousin
walk
in
with
his
graduating
class
wearing
the
gold
honor
cord,
I
turned
to
my
parents
and
told
them
that
would
be
me
someday.
To
their
utter
dismay
I
followed
through,
and
more.
I
graduated
top
of
my
class
with
an
unweighted
4.0
GPA.
It
didnOt
always
seem
possible
though,
I
had
a
nagging
Achilles
heelE
writing.
Since
elementary
school
writing
just
scared
me,
it
was
the
one
thing
I
had
work
extra
hard
at
to
be
good
at.
In
the
second
grade
Mrs.
Brouwer
was
teaching
my
class
about
the
ocean,
and
at
the
end
of
the
weeklong
section
we
had
to
pick
our
favorite
sea
creature
and
write
a
two-page
fictional
story
about
it.
To
a
second
grader,
a
two-page
paper
seemed
daunting.
Already
I
had
grown
accustomed
to
being
good
at
everything
my
teachers
put
in
front
of
me,
and
I
was
so
scared
I
wouldnOt
write
the
best
paper
in
the
class
that
I
cried
hysterically
every
time
I
tried
to
work
on
it.
Needless
to
say,
my
writing
career
was
not
starting
off
on
a
positive
note.
It
wasnOt
showing
any
signs
of
improving
when
in
third
grade
one
of
the
most
tragic
events
in
our
countryOs
history
occurred,
September
11,
2001.
My
cousin
was
in
the
MarineOs
and
almost
immediately
shipped
overseas
to
join
the
fight.
My
cousin
and
I
have
always
been
and
still
are
very
best
friends,
but
I
hated
writing
so
much
that
I
refused
to
write
him
letters.
Instead,
I
drew
him
pictures,
I
sent
him
at
least
one
hundred
pictures
during
all
of
his
deployments
(one
of
which
is
still
hanging
at
a
base
in
Iraq).
My
third
grade
teacher
caught
on
to
my
fear
and
dislike
of
writing,
so
every
time
there
was
a
writing
assignment
in
class
she
would
let
me
sit
by
myself
in
a
beanbag
chair
so
that
I
would
feel
more
comfortable.
It
didnOt
help
me
conquer
that
fear,
but
I
felt
pretty
special.
These
feelings
towards
writing
continued
all
through
elementary
school.
All
my
teachers
told
me
I
needed
to
be
more
creative
and
more
interesting
with
my
writing.
I
have
a
good
imagination,
but
when
I
was
scared
of
not
being
the
best,
all
creativity
left
me.
I
didnOt
think
I
would
ever
like
writing,
until
Mr.
Chapman
and
the
first
writing
assignment
that
seemed
easy
D
a
research
paper.
We
had
to
write
a
paper
about
our
local
history
as
a
farming
community.
Luckily
for
me,
my
dad
worked
for
our
county
in
the
CAOOs
office,
so
I
had
access
to
every
piece
of
information
I
could
ever
want.
I
was
in
heaven,
all
I
had
to
do
was
learn
about
something
and
write
about
what
I
learned.
My
teacher
did
not
teach
us
how
to
write
a
proper
research
paper,
there
was
no
bibliography,
and
the
majority
of
the
class
used
the
first
person
point
of
view
to
write
the
paper,
but
I
did
not
have
to
be
creative.
Finally
in
middle
school,
I
was
taught
how
to
write
an
actual
research
paper
by
Mrs.
Roni
OOConnell.
She
taught
me
how
to
introduce
the
topics
of
research,
flow
from
one
topic
to
another,
teach
the
audience
without
just
spewing
facts,
and
analyze
deeper
than
just
the
facts.
This
led
to
a
12
page
literary
analysis
of
Flowers
for
Algernon
that
Mrs.
OOConnell
said
was
high
school
caliber.
Since
I
was
in
the
8th
grade
at
the
time
I
was
ecstatic
to
hear
a
former
AP
English
teacher
tell
me
that
I
was
writing
at
a
level
higher
than
my
grade
level.
At
this
point
I
finally
began
to
have
confidence
in
my
writing,
I
love
to
learn,
so
writing
about
what
IOm
learning
wasnOt
as
tedious
as
creative
writing
was
in
elementary
school.
Then
honors
English
freshman
year
came
around,
the
writing
wasnOt
terrible,
the
majority
being
research
and
literary
analyses,
but
the
promise
of
delivering
our
biggest
assignments
as
speeches
was
the
most
terrifying
thing
I
could
imagine.
So
to
make
up
for
my
fear
of
public
speaking,
I
worked
extra
hard
at
making
sure
I
had
the
best
papers
in
the
class.
When
speech
day
finally
dawned
I
had
spent
so
much
time
preparing
for
the
writing
that
I
hadnOt
even
thought
about
the
speech,
and
I
delivered
it
with
ease,
earning
an
A
on
the
project
and
gaining
more
self
confidence
than
I
could
have
imagined.
With
the
first
of
three
speeches
out
of
the
way,
the
rest
was
smooth
sailing.
By
junior
year,
I
was
pretty
confident
with
my
abilities
as
a
writer,
but
I
still
had
not
found
that
spark
inside
of
me
that
made
me
enjoy
it,
or
look
forward
to
it.
At
this
point
in
my
academic
life
I
was
preparing
for
the
SATOs,
so
in
class
we
wrote
the
majority
of
our
essays
as
timed
responses
to
political
journalistsO
articles
from
the
New
York
Times.
This
is
the
most
opinionated
writing
I
have
ever
attempted,
and
it
started
to
bring
my
writing
full
circle.
Back
in
elementary
school,
my
teachers
wanted
me
to
be
more
interesting,
and
writing
about
opinions
and
view
points
of
world
events
forced
me
to
make
my
writing
unique,
otherwise
my
teacher
and
other
readers
would
just
be
bored.
Writing
at
this
point
was
still
just
something
I
had
to
do,
I
would
put
off
take
home
assignments
until
the
last
minute,
and
only
put
in
the
effort
needed
to
keep
my
A
in
the
class.
Until
senior
year,
and
Mr.
RoehlOs
AP
World
Literature
class.
The
first
day
of
class
we
walked
in
and
he
had
us
push
the
desks
off
to
the
side
of
the
room.
Then
like
in
kindergarten
we
sat
in
a
circle
cross-legged
on
the
floor,
and
just
talked.
We
talked
about
our
summer
vacations,
where
we
wanted
to
go
to
college,
what
our
goals
were,
what
books
we
wanted
to
read,
what
authors
we
wanted
to
study,
what
cultures
we
wanted
to
study,
if
we
wanted
to
travel
and
where.
We
talked
about
everything.
Marlin
Roehl
was
the
first
English
teacher
I
had
ever
had
who
took
the
time
to
get
to
know
us
all,
so
he
could
help
us
all
become
better
writers,
students,
and
people.
After
talking
to
me,
he
realized
how
much
I
love
math
and
science,
and
English
was
always
just
that
class
I
had
to
get
through.
During
our
conversation
he
listened
and
asked
a
few
questions,
and
I
assumed
that
was
the
end
of
the
conversation.
But,
the
next
day
he
brought
in
a
stack
of
articles
that
were
all
about
subjects
I
was
enthralled
with:
the
worldOs
tallest
building,
biomedical
engineering,
science
behind
a
fast
pitch
throw,
engineering
and
design
of
military
equipment,
and
many
more.
He
let
me
read
all
these
on
my
own
time,
then
we
had
lunch
at
Panera
together
to
discuss
it
all,
and
to
talk
about
how
the
articles
were
written.
After
that
lunch
I
gained
a
better
idea
of
what
I
wanted
to
do
with
my
life,
and
I
realized
how
these
authors
had
all
brought
life
to
their
writing
in
one
way
or
another.
They
didnOt
just
discharge
facts
onto
paper;
they
made
it
interesting.
It
must
have
been,
because
I
read
a
ten-page
article
on
the
shoulder
joint
and
was
captivated
the
entire
time.
I
was
really
excited
to
keep
getting
to
know
Mr.
Roehl
more,
and
learning
more
about
how
I
can
make
non-fiction
writing
fun.
All
this
after
just
one
week
in
the
class.
Our
first
writing
assignment
was
a
take
home
essay
on
the
philosophical
text,
SophieOs
World.
I
did
the
best
I
could,
but
I
knew
it
needed
a
lot
of
work
to
get
the
Marlin
Roehl
seal
of
approval.
Prior
to
his
high
school
teaching
days
he
was
a
professor
at
UC
Santa
Barbara,
and
he
graded
our
papers
like
he
was
still
teaching
there.
My
paper
came
back
with
so
much
red
ink
on
it;
I
thought
his
pen
had
exploded,
but
I
managed
an
85%.
I
went
home
that
night
and
read
all
he
had
to
say.
He
was
honest
and
helpful
with
every
critique,
I
wrote
down
all
the
things
I
needed
to
work
on
in
a
journal,
and
set
up
a
time
to
get
coffee
with
him
so
we
could
go
even
further
into
how
I
could
make
my
writing
better.
I
added
to
my
journal
and
by
the
time
our
next
paper
was
due,
an
analysis
of
Mary
ShelleyOs
Frankenstein,
I
was
ready
to
knock
it
out
of
the
park.
I
was
so
excited
when
it
came
back
with
a
big
red
98%
and
smiley
faces
and
positive
comments.
Unfortunately,
I
let
this
small
success
go
straight
to
my
head
and
I
relaxed.
Before
I
knew
it,
it
was
the
night
before
our
next
paper
was
due
and
I
sat
in
front
of
my
computer
with
the
worst
written
paragraph
in
the
history
of
writing.
I
started
typing
words,
anything
to
get
me
to
that
5-page
requirement.
At
4am
I
reached
the
5th
page
at
last.
I
was
so
distraught
with
the
work
I
did,
I
was
sure
Mr.
Roehl
wouldnOt
even
grade
it.
I
was
almost
in
tears
when
I
handed
him
my
paper.
Four
days
later,
he
asked
me
to
stay
after
class.
I
thought
to
myself,
Nthis
is
it,
youOre
going
to
fail,
writing
has
finally
got
the
best
of
you.
Say
goodbye
to
Valedictorian.O
However,
Mr.
Roehl
did
the
most
gracious,
unexpected
thing
I
have
seen
a
teacher
do.
EVER.
He
told
me
my
paper
at
the
moment
was
worthy
of
a
65%
generously,
and
he
knew
that
is
not
indicative
of
my
normal
work,
and
I
had
three
weeks
more
to
rewrite
the
paper.
The
tears
did
start
to
flow
after
that.
This
grade
was
completely
due
to
my
lack
of
effort
on
the
assignment,
and
here
is
this
brilliant
man
who
has
no
reason
to
give
me
a
second
chance,
giving
me
more
than
just
a
second
chance.
I
had
three
weeks
for
the
rewrite
and
the
first
time
around
we
only
had
a
week
and
a
half.
Needless
to
say,
I
took
full
advantage
of
this
undeserved
second
chance,
and
pulled
an
85%
on
the
rewrite.
This
was
by
no
means
the
98%
I
earned
on
the
last
paper,
but
considering
I
still
do
not
understand
Oedipus
Rex
to
this
day,
I
was
very
pleased
with
a
20%
increase
in
my
grade.
After
this
eye
opening
experience,
I
set
clear
standards
for
my
writing
and
demanded
that
I
give
my
best
effort
on
every
assignment.
It
proved
successful
and
I
received
grades
above
90%
on
every
other
assignment
in
this
class.
The
advancements
I
made
in
writing
as
well
as
in
everyday
life
from
Mr.
RoehlOs
class
ensured
a
smooth
transition
for
me
when
I
reached
Lafayette.
I
owe
so
much
of
my
success
in
my
FYS
and
College
Writing
classes
to
the
knowledge
I
gained
from
Mr.
Roehl.
He
taught
me
to
open
my
mind
to
more
than
just
the
logical
factual
side
of
life.
He
showed
me
how
to
show
emotion
and
paint
a
picture
with
my
writing.
He
forced
me
to
identify
my
weaknesses
in
writing
and
improve
on
them.
Prior
to
his
class,
my
modus
operandi
was
to
strengthen
everything
else
and
not
worry
about
my
weaknesses.
But,
having
a
stronger
all
around
writing
base
going
into
my
freshman
year
of
college
was
vital
to
maintaining
stellar
grades.
