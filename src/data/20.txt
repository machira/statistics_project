The
WRITES
of
Passage
August
28,
1995
WA
Assignment
There
once
was
a
girl
named
Heather,
whose
imagination
ran
miles
farther
than
her
pencil.
could
tell
a
story
that
would
impress,
amaze,
and
downright
astound
listeners
near
and
far.
Unfortunately,
she
could
not
articulate
her
thoughts
on
paper
to
save
her
life.
Plagued
by
this
miserable
turn
of
events,
was
forced
to
spend
much
of
her
early
life
slaving
over
pages
and
pages
of
blank,
thick-lined
copybooks
with
animals
and
letters
on
the
cover,
grasping
for
words,
phrases,
similes,
metaphors--anything
that
would
make
Sister
Mary
Ella
happy.
Today
that
same
Heather,
now
a
junior
at
Lafayette
College,
is
secure
in
her
womanhood.
She
feels
good
about
herself.
Those
nights
that
spent
lying
awake
in
her
bed,
a
lonely
child
desperate
for
alliteration,
onomatopoeia
or
various
other
forms
of
literal
expression,
have
virtually
disappeared
being
replaced
by
images
of
innocent
freshmen
dying
for
thesis
statements
that
satisfy
English
110
professors.
At
the
drop
of
a
hat
she
can
formulate
a
paper
of
a
similar
caliber
to
those
stories
that
she
used
to
tell
in
the
schoolyard
and
on
the
corners
back
in
Philly.
Ah,
the
writing
process!
My
development
as
a
writer
has
been
nothing
short
of
a
struggle--both
mental
and
physical.
It
has
been
a
mental
one
in
terms
of
the
thought
process
which
underlies
the
creation
of
a
literary
work
and
a
physical
one
simply
because
I
am
too
lazy
to
get
things
down
on
paper--my
hand
hurts
after
three
sentences.
In
any
case
and
like
any
other
writer,
I
have
had
my
fair
share
of
positive
and
negative
experiences,
a
few
of
which
I
will
happily
and
humorously
recount
in
the
following
narrative.
In
the
words
of
Sophia
Patrillo
("Golden
Girls"),
Picture
this.
Philadelphia.
1980.
St.
Mary
of
Czestochowa
elementary
school.
Sr.
Mary
Ella's
first
grade
classroom.
Thirty
whining,
rambunctious,
recalcitrant
seven-year-olds
mispronouncing
words,
throwing
schoolbags
and
clapping
erasers--on
the
backs
of
fellow
classmates,
blue
polyester
uniforms
and
all.
Now
I
was
a
rather
mature
first
grader.
I
was
calm,
cool,
collected
and
ready
to
plunge
into
the
world
of
academia
brain
first.
Although
I
was
not
as
gung-ho
about
writing
as
other
kids
were,
I
distinctly
remember
one
specific
story
that
I
composed
in
the
fall
of
1980.
This
is
probably
the
earliest
memory
I
have
of
my
first
attempts
at
writing.
It
was
approaching
Halloween
and
like
any
good
nun
should,
Sr.
Mary
Ella
had
us
write
a
story
about
the
holiday,
after
she
spouted
on
about
its
religious
significance.
While
my
friends
were
writing
stories
about
scary
black
cats
and
goblins
with
forty
teeth,
I
chose
a
more
seriously
and
health
conscious
topic--the
Tylenol-in-the-Halloween-candy
craze
that
plagued
the
nation
in
1980.
Quite
sincerely,
my
story
was
about
a
boy
whose
mother
took
him
out
to
trick
or
treat
and
how
he
could
not
eat
his
candy
until
he
got
home
and
mommy
checked
it.
She
had
to
check
it
because
there
were
some
very
bad
people
in
the
world
who
liked
to
poison
little
kids
like
him.
I
was
very
proud
of
my
story
and
so
was
Sr.
Mary
Ella.
My
mother
was
very
impressed
as
well
that
her
little
girl
was
that
conscious
of
the
things
that
went
on
around
her
(she
bragged
for
days
to
all
the
women
in
work).
My
mother
still
has
that
story
in
her
keepsake
box,
pencil
smudges
and
all.
I
do
not
remember
much
of
my
early
experiences
as
a
writer
other
than
the
fact
that
I
always
seemed
to
have
trouble
saying
what
I
wanted
to
say
clearly
and
concisely.
I
spent
many
third
grade
assignments
crying
to
my
mother
because
I
knew
what
I
wanted
to
say
and
could
not
find
the
words
to
say
it.
It
really
bothered
me
when
I
sat
for
hours
in
front
of
a
piece
of
looseleaf
and
could
not
even
come
up
with
an
introductory
paragraph
for
an
essay
on
what
I
wanted
to
be
when
I
grew
up.
Another
problem
I
had
was
long-windedness,
a
problem
which
presently
pervades
my
writing.
I
am
a
true
believer
in
unstifled
creativity,
but
even
I
would
like
to
be
able
to
write
a
five-page
paper
in
five
pages.
I
must
admit
though,
I
have
gotten
better
over
the
years
through
practice
and
consultation
with
teachers.
It
never
really
mattered
what
the
assignment
was
that
I
had
to
complete
either.
Whether
it
was
writing
for
school
or
the
attempts
I
made
at
keeping
a
diary,
it
was
always
the
same--I
sat
for
a
long
time,
maybe
wrote
a
lot
of
things
down,
crossed
them
out,
and
sat
some
more.
Often
my
mother
would
complete
the
bulk
of
my
writing
assignments
just
because
she
could
not
stand
to
see
me
beat
myself
up
over
it.
The
quality
of
instruction
that
I
received
in
terms
of
developing
writing
techniques
and
skills
for
producing
admirable
works
was
not
altogether
outstanding
either.
Elementary
school
teachers
seemed
to
just
go
through
the
motions
but
never
placed
any
considerable
emphasis
on
how
important
writing
was
or
the
gravity
of
its
use
in
the
real
world.
Once
I
got
to
high
school,
it
got
a
little
better,
but
honestly,
no
one
ever
showed
me
how
writing
could
be
an
enjoyable
experience--until
I
got
to
Lafayette.
Before
I
came
to
Lafayette,
I
was
what
I
would
consider,
not
a
very
good
writer.
My
papers
were
circular,
they
missed
the
point,
they
were
holey
and
just
plain
boring.
I
always
felt
like
there
was
something
I
did
not
say
but
that
if
I
had
it
would
have
taken
me
ten
more
pages.
In
short,
I
was
in
desperate
need
of
assistance.
Teachers'
comments
from
my
pre-Lafayette
writing
days
included
things
like,
You
got
a
good
start
but
you
kind
of
lost
it
after
a
while,
or
I
know
what
you
are
trying
to
say
but
you
need
to
get
right
to
the
meat
of
the
argument,
and
better
still
What
exactly
is
your
argument?
Where
is
your
thesis?
As
hurtful
as
these
comments
were,
I
agreed
with
them
and
vowed
to
remedy
my
situation,
just
not
in
my
freshman
year
at
college.
My
First
Year
Seminar
was
definitely
not
the
place
to
enhance
my
writing
skills.
I
could
not
even
grasp
the
concept
of
the
class
let
alone
develop
my
own
thoughts
about
it.
English
110
however
helped
me
out
quite
a
bit.
My
professor
embraced
the
writing
process
as
a
new
born
baby--treating
it
with
the
utmost
care
while
watching
it
grow
into
something
that
could
speak
one
thousand
thoughts
with
just
one
word.
My
professor
took
the
time
to
make
analogies
about
writing,
making
it
easier
for
the
visual
learner
in
me
to
understand
and
appreciate
writing
as
an
art
form,
not
a
form
of
Chinese
torture.
He
drew
pictures,
made
charts
and
graphs,
told
stories
and
recalled
anecdotes
which
made
my
problem
seem
solvable.
I
was
going
to
be
a
decent
writer
if
it
killed
me.
Sophomore
year
was
the
pinnacle
of
my
writing
career
thus
far.
I
met
one
of
the
most
amazing
professors
that
year
and
he
completely
changed
my
attitude
about
writing.
The
first
paper
I
wrote
for
his
class
was
a
mess.
I
had
been
to
see
him
at
least
three
times,
once
in
tears,
over
this
paper
and
he
walked
me
through
the
paper
as
if
it
was
a
stroll
in
the
park.
He
helped
me
with
my
attitude,
my
organizational
skills
and
my
final
product.
It
took
me
three
papers,
each
one
better
than
the
other,
and
a
lot
of
visits
to
his
office
to
earn
myself
an
A-
in
his
writing
course.
As
I
enter
my
junior
year
of
college,
I
feel
that
I
have
made
significant
improvements
as
a
writer.
Although
my
papers
are
still
slightly
longer
than
assigned,
I
am
able
to
complete
a
paper
and
feel
confident
that
it
is
a
quality
piece
of
writing.
The
grades
that
I
have
received
on
assignments
in
the
past
year
have
been
some
of
the
best
ones
that
I
have
ever
received.
As
one
grows
older
and
gains
more
experience
in
a
particular
area,
it
is
expected
that
he/she
will
become
more
comfortable
with
a
task,
completing
it
with
a
certain
level
of
mastery.
Looking
back
on
the
history
of
myself
as
a
writer,
I
mentally
compare
papers
that
I
wrote
in
grade
school
with
those
that
I
have
written
in
high
school
with
those
that
I
have
written
in
college.
Such
a
collection
makes
for
an
interesting
basis
for
comparison.
In
retrospect,
I
can
detect
sections
of
my
previous
writing
that
were
incorrect
or
disorganized
and
can
actually
offer
myself
solutions
to
those
problem
areas,
largely
due
to
the
fact
that
over
the
years
I
have
learned
a
great
deal
about
how
to
write.
The
writing
process
truly
is
the
evolution
of
thoughts
combined
with
the
workings
of
a
creative
mind.
