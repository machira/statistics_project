Red.
No
pun
intended.
ItOs
funny,
but
the
very
first
remembrance
I
have
of
reading
is
the
color
red.
I
donOt
know
what
was
red;
it
could
have
been
a
dog,
a
truck,
a
shirt.
In
the
grand
scheme
of
things,
it
doesnOt
matter.
What
does
matter
is
how
I
felt
about
that
red
thing.
I
was
in
front
of
my
kindergarten
class,
telling
them
that
whatever
it
was,
it
was
definitely
red.
Being
able
to
turn
words
on
a
page
into
a
viable
mental
image
set
my
mind
on
fire.
I
began
to
read.
IOm
definitely
not
claiming
to
have
started
writing
with
abandon,
that
part
came
slowly.
But
I
did
begin
to
read.
I
read
everything
that
I
could
piece
together.
The
authors
arenOt
important.
At
that
formative
stage,
I
was
so
caught
up
in
the
whole
concept
that
I
didnOt
even
care
about
the
plot,
much
less
the
more
sophisticated
literary
techniques.
I
loved
decoding
the
letters
and
words,
turning
them
into
sentences
and
paragraphs
and
maybe
taking
a
brief
glimpse
into
the
authorOs
mind.
Observing
others
express
themselves
through
the
written
word
helped
me
to
develop
my
own
ability
to
do
so.
My
writing
ability
would
evolve
slowly,
shaped
at
first
by
my
reading
experiences,
and
later
on
by
the
shape
of
my
high
school
and
college
curriculum.
My
first
memory
of
writing
is
from
second
grade,
and
it
focuses
on
the
manner
in
which
I
was
writing
instead
of
the
content.
I
remember
lined
paper,
with
a
huge
rule
that
had
a
dotted
line
through
the
center.
Lower
case
letters
were
to
stay
below
the
dots
while
their
uppercase
counterparts
filled
the
whole
rule.
We
were
learning
cursive,
something
I
hated.
I
hated
having
to
learn
a
whole
new
way
to
do
something
when
I
hadnOt
even
mastered
the
primary
method
I
began
to
resent
writing,
solely
because
of
the
hassle
that
the
technique
entailed.
At
that
point
in
my
literary
development,
a
dichotomy
began
to
form
that
still
shapes
my
use
of
these
tools
to
this
day.
Where
my
writing
experiences
remained
based
around
the
formation
of
letters,
my
reading
experiences
branched
out,
into
more
explorative
fields.
The
ability
to
express
myself
through
writing
suffered,
since
much
of
my
practice
was
confined
to
preconstructed
sentences
designed
to
assess
my
letter-forming
ability.
And
then
the
writing
stopped.
Between
the
fourth
and
ninth
grades,
I
remember
having
two
writing
assignments,
only
one
of
which
is
memorable
enough
for
me
to
recall
the
problem
that
it
asked
me
to
solve.
The
project
was
the
creation
of
the
journal
of
a
fictional
character,
based
in
historical
America.
The
social
studies
class
that
prompted
the
assignment
was
taught
by
one
of
my
all-time
favorite
instructors,
and
I
dove
in
headfirst.
It
was
harder
than
I
expected.
I
wasnOt
used
to
writing
to
communicate
on
such
a
thorough
basis,
and
I
didnOt
know
where
to
begin.
My
organization
was
poor
and
I
only
received
a
B
on
the
assignment.
It
was
one
of
the
most
disappointing
Bs
of
my
life.
Not
because
I
thought
my
work
warranted
a
better
grade,
but
because
I
had
such
a
clear
mental
picture
of
how
I
wanted
my
work
to
turn
out,
and
it
looked
nothing
like
the
piece
that
I
actually
produced.
It
was
frustrating,
and
the
curriculum
that
was
being
fed
to
me
entailed
very
few
writing
assignments
that
would
give
me
the
chance
to
implement
the
same
amount
of
organization
and
thought.
The
obvious
result
of
that
absence
was
a
corresponding
lack
of
practice
on
my
part
during
my
middle
school
years.
This
would
have
created
a
challenge
for
me
were
the
quantity
of
my
assignments
to
have
increased
in
high
school.
It
didnOt.
The
only
writing
I
practiced
in
ninth
and
tenth
grade
was
for
the
New
York
State
regentsO
examinations
in
English
and
social
studies.
Please
allow
me
to
explain
why
the
New
York
State
regentsO
curriculum
partially
crippled
my
writing
development.
Teachers
are
evaluated
based
on
their
studentsO
performance
on
the
regentsO
exams.
Writing
techniques
are
designed
specifically
for
students
to
use
on
the
tests.
There
are
only
so
many
ways
to
describe
a
five
paragraph
persuasive
essay,
and
because
of
the
standardization
of
the
regents,
a
five
paragraph
persuasive
essay
was
the
only
acceptable
form
of
response.
An
introduction,
followed
by
three
body
paragraphs,
and
a
conclusion.
All
written
in
a
little
blue
book
in
under
30
minutes.
I
am
not
saying
that
this
style
of
writing
is
bad,
indeed,
it
taught
me
to
be
a
succinct
and
get
straight
to
the
point,
but
I
am
saying
that
it
shouldnOt
be
oneOs
exclusive
mode
of
literary
expression.
The
other
major
form
of
writing
that
I
practiced
in
high
school
was
journalistic.
For
two
years
I
contributed
to
my
award-winning
school
newspaper,
editing
it
in
my
senior
year.
That
last
sentence
looks
and
sounds
like
one
that
I
would
write
on
an
application
for
some
sort
of
job
or
scholarship,
but
I
threw
it
in
because
I
really
am
quite
proud
of
my
journalistic
pursuits.
Writing
for
the
Emerald
Press
gave
me
a
bit
of
leeway
in
my
literary
style
because
of
the
large
range
of
topics
that
I
covered,
from
sports,
to
culture,
to
school
news.
I
learned
a
lot
from
my
journalism
experience,
a
main
point
of
which
was
that
writing
something
for
publication
gives
the
author
quite
a
bit
of
power.
Granted,
my
influence
over
the
small
hamlet
of
Hamilton
didnOt
cause
planets
to
collide
and
the
tides
to
stop,
but
the
popularity
of
my
paper
displayed
the
influence
of
journalistic
influence
on
a
smaller
scale.
I
will
go
into
more
depth:
A
normal
person
is
reasonably
well
aware
of
what
is
going
on
in
the
world
around
them.
They
have
that
awareness
not
because
they
are
well
acquainted
with
all
the
inner
workings
of
their
environment,
but
because
they
have
read
or
listened
to
the
reports
of
those
who
are.
Because
of
this
separation,
the
middleman
holds
a
gigantic
influence
in
public
perception.
The
reporterOs
own
opinion
filters
through
their
description
of
events,
and
the
public,
in
many
cases,
molds
their
version
of
the
facts
to
what
they
have
read.
This
process
was
realized
to
me
in
high
school,
when
teachers
and
students
alike
would
approach
me
and
discuss
topics
that
I
had
covered
in
the
previous
weekOs
issue.
Knowledge
is
power,
but
communication
of
that
knowledge
is
the
only
way
power
can
be
implemented.
Journalism
also
changed
the
light
in
which
I
viewed
writing
in
a
more
personal
way.
Writing
opinion
articles
and
reviews
opened
my
eyes
to
the
possibilities
that
writing
had
to
offer.
Until
this
point
in
high
school,
I
had
never
liked
writing,
because
it
always
came
and
the
hands
of
a
demonic
test.
Writing
to
me
had
meant
that
I
would
jot
down
a
rote
set
of
sentences
in
a
given
order
so
that
my
response
would
satisfy
a
grading
rubric.
I
hadnOt
realized
that
writing
was
more
of
an
expression
of
consciousness
rather
than
a
methodic
tool.
Writing
human-interest
pieces,
opinions
and
the
like
for
the
Emerald
Press
gave
me
a
forum
that
had
never
been
open
to
me
before.
The
best
part
about
the
writing
that
I
was
doing
was
the
response
that
it
was
evoking
in
myself.
I
absolutely
loved
reading
my
words
in
print.
One
of
the
high
points
of
my
week
would
be
opening
a
new
issue
and
reading
my
work
and
being
proud
that
other
people
were
reading
my
work
too.
Writing
like
this
gave
me
a
new
kind
of
confidence
that
never
came
to
me
through
my
other
subjects
or
pastimes.
The
single
biggest
and
most
serious
writing
task
that
I
took
on
during
my
last
two
years
of
high
school
actually
occurred
outside
of
the
walls
of
Hamilton
Central
School.
I
was
a
part
of
the
Community
Students
Program,
which
allows
select
high
school
students
to
take
classes
at
Colgate
University
at
a
discounted
rate.
During
the
first
semester
of
senior
year,
I
took
a
core
science
course
titled
NScience
and
RiskO.
The
course
was
not
the
hands
on
science
lab
that
I
expected
it
to
be.
It
was
more
of
a
professor
explaining
what
a
course
like
that
would
be
like
were
we
to
take
it
next
semester.
In
any
case,
the
curriculum
entailed
a
lot
of
indecipherable
reading
and
an
informal
response
journal.
That
part
was
not
so
bad,
I
could
read
well
enough.
What
scared
me
was
the
section
on
the
syllabus
titled
NResearch
PapersO.
I
had
never
written
a
research
paper,
and
didnOt
know
how
to
go
about
doing
one.
I
decided
to
put
off
worrying
about
it.
The
first
paper
wasnOt
due
for
a
month,
I
thought
to
myself,
there
was
plenty
of
time
for
me
to
figure
out
what
I
was
doing.
A
month
went
by
and
I
still
had
no
idea
what
I
was
doing.
I
finally
sat
down
at
the
computer
in
a
panic
two
nights
before
the
paper
was
due
and
typed
everything
I
knew
about
my
topic.
The
paper
was
two
pages
longer
than
it
needed
to
be.
I
was
shocked.
After
reading
through
it,
though,
I
realized
the
sheer
quantity
of
repetition
and
redundancy,
so
the
next
night,
I
sat
down
to
do
some
editing.
After
moving
some
paragraphs
around
and
eliminating
a
lot
of
pointless
sentences,
my
paper
was
exactly
the
right
length.
I
handed
it
in
with
surprising
confidence.
That
confidence
was
beaten
with
a
heavy
club
the
next
week
when
I
got
back
a
C.
IOd
like
it
if
I
could
say
that
my
professor
helped
me
to
understand
my
paperOs
faults,
but
because
of
two
separate
reasons,
he
didnOt
help
at
all.
First
of
all,
he
never
went
through
Ms.
McGillOs
second
grade
writing
class
to
learn
to
form
his
letters
correctly.
Second
of
all,
he
was
from
somewhere
in
Eastern
Europe
and
had
an
accent
so
thick
it
sounded
like
he
was
talking
with
a
mouth
full
of
peanut
butter.
Consequently,
when
I
read
his
comments
I
had
no
idea
what
I
did
wrong,
and
when
I
went
to
see
him,
I
only
got
more
confused.
The
only
reason
anyone
in
that
class
understood
a
word
of
what
he
was
saying
was
a
projector
that
showed
an
accompanying
PowerPoint
presentation
for
each
lecture.
In
any
case,
I
still
didnOt
know
what
was
wrong
with
my
paper.
I
had
written
in
a
clear
and
concise
manner
everything
that
had
been
required
to
explain
and
resolve
my
topic.
I
decided
to
go
to
a
different
source
for
help.
My
journalism
teacher
read
my
paper
and
in
three
minutes
had
me
on
the
right
track.
I
had
no
thesis
sentence.
I
had
set
up
the
paper
like
I
had
one,
as
far
as
structure
goes,
but
I
launched
into
my
conversation
with
so
much
as
an
introduction.
It
made
perfect
sense
once
it
was
explained
to
me
in
lucid,
rational,
English-spoken
terms.
The
moral
of
that
little
anecdote
is
a
bit
worn
out.
I
learned
from
my
experience.
I
copied
my
method,
using
stream
of
consciousness
to
write
the
body
of
my
final
paper,
and
then
sat
down
and
organized
what
I
had
written
around
a
central
theme,
creating
a
thesis
statement.
To
this
day,
I
frequently
employ
the
same
method,
and
you
are
reading
a
product
of
it.
Writing
two
papers
in
my
senior
year
did
not
prepare
me
for
college
writing.
I
was
afraid
of
college
writing.
Petrified.
I
was
afraid
because
I
knew
there
was
going
to
be
writing
in
college.
Lots
of
it.
I
was
afraid
because
I
knew
that
I
had
poured
so
much
work
in
that
paper,
and
I
was
so
proud
of
it,
and
I
still
got
a
C.
I
was
afraid
because
I
knew
that
that
C
didnOt
necessarily
mean
I
was
stupid,
it
meant
that
I
had
made
a
single
(albeit
major)
error.
Where
in
high
school
I
could
get
by
with
making
a
mistake
here
or
there,
in
college
I
knew
I
wasnOt
going
to
be
extended
that
luxury.
I
was
afraid
because
I
knew
college
writing
was
going
to
be
hard.
Despite
all
that
fear,
I
went
into
college
with
at
least
one
reason
to
be
confident.
I
knew
that
I
was
going
to
have
something
to
say
about
the
topics
that
I
would
be
writing
on.
Regardless
of
whether
I
mastered
the
form
and
technique
of
the
college
writing,
I
would
still
have
my
opinions.
My
instincts
were
right
on
both
counts.
During
the
first
semester
of
freshman
year,
I
can
confidently
say
that
I
wrote
more
than
in
junior
and
senior
years
of
high
school
combined.
This
past
semester,
I
can
say
with
equal
confidence
that
I
wrote
four
times
that
amount.
There
is
something
to
be
afraid
of
if
youOre
coming
to
college
without
a
lot
of
writing
experience,
because
there
is
a
lot
of
writing
to
be
done.
However,
my
second
instinctual
reaction
was
equally
valid.
I
spoke
confidently
about
almost
every
topic
I
was
assigned.
My
writing
has
evolved
in
college.
I
used
to
tremble
at
the
thought
of
writing
a
seven-page
paper,
now
I
can
write
that
much
on
a
Sunday
afternoon.
When
you
write
frequently,
you
get
better
at
it.
Once
you
are
comfortable
working
within
a
given
form,
you
can
turn
your
attention
back
to
the
content
that
you
are
discussing,
and
that
is
where
the
most
powerful
part
of
the
writing
process
lies.
The
words
begin
to
come
to
you
easier,
the
sentences
almost
form
themselves.
Your
ideas
begin
to
become
more
clearly
expressed.
My
writing
style
has
stayed
very
similar
since
my
experiences
in
high
school
described
above.
What
has
changed,
and
in
my
opinion
improved,
since
I
have
started
attending
Lafayette,
is
my
comfort
level
when
writing.
IOll
leave
with
a
quote
from
Aldus
Huxley
that
I
think
is
appropriate
in
describing
my
writing
style.
NImpulse
arrested
spills
over,
and
the
flood
is
feeling,
the
flood
is
passion,
the
flood
is
even
madness:
it
depends
on
the
force
of
the
current,
the
height
and
strength
of
the
barrier.O
The
barrier
is
the
form
of
my
writing,
which,
as
it
grows
stronger,
becomes
more
adept
at
harnessing
my
thoughts,
pulling
them
from
chaotic
pieces
of
information
into
rational
and
cohesive
words,
sentences
and
paragraphs.
Instead
of
arresting
impulse,
my
writing
techniques
have
guided
it
and
led
it
in
the
right
direction.
