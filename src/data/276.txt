Writing
Profile
My
past
year
of
writing
is
characterized
by
roughly
three
experiences
-
one
a
class,
one
my
personal
writing,
and
one
my
poetic
writing.
I
cannot,
or
will
not,
present
these
experiences
in
the
form
of
a
narrative
-
just
as
some
are
handicapped
in
the
realm
of
expository
writing,
so
others
are
in
spinning
forth
narrative;
it
is
an
English
professor's
preference,
the
methods
of
post-modernist
narrative-think,
not
mine.
This
disaffection
noted,
I
proceed
as
I
see
fit:
a
reflection
in
three
(perhaps
unequal)
parts.
Thus
begins
part
one.
My
academic
writing
this
past
year
was
for
two
professors
only;
with
the
first,
my
experience
was
unremarkable,
though
there
were
ups
and
downs
in
the
relationship
(between
my
words
and
my
thoughts,
between
my
writing
and
my
professor,
whichever
you
prefer).
With
the
second,
my
experience
was
more
formative,
I
think.
I
had
two
courses
with
this
professor,
both
in
the
spring
semester.
For
one,
I
had
to
write
a
research
paper
of
roughly
twenty
pages.
For
the
other,
I
had
to
write
one
four-to-five-page
paper
a
week.
In
the
latter
instance,
we
were
given
a
reading
each
week
(from
the
tradition
of
contemporary
analytic
philosophy)
and
were
expected
to
analyze
and
comment
upon
that
reading
in
that
week's
paper.
The
entire
course
consisted
in
this
exercise,
and
we
had
the
full
week
to
give
our
undivided
attention
to
the
production
of
our
analyses.
Since
both
of
these
writing-assignments
were
from
the
same
teacher
and
in
the
same
semester,
they
formed
an
unified
experience
for
me;
more
specifically,
they
formed
an
uniformly
unpleasant
experience
for
me.
There
were
a
number
of
components
to
this
experience.
First,
I
felt
frustration
with
the
professor's
methodology,
particularly
as
the
semester
progressed.
He
would
return
papers
to
me
saying
that,
though
they
were
well
written,
they
had
missed
some
point
or
other
of
importance
about
the
assigned
reading.
Sometimes
this
was
true,
but
sometimes
the
omission
to
which
he
referred
was
based
not
merely
on
an
oversight
on
my
part,
but
rather
derived
from
a
genuine
difference
of
interpretation
between
the
two
of
us.
I
felt
that
some
of
these
papers
really
were
justified,
but
I
also
knew
that
my
professor
and
I
had
different
ideas
of
what
constituted
a
proper
analysis
of
these
types
of
papers.
This
content-level
difficulty
made
writing
for
my
professor
a
chore;
and
since
some
of
these
content-difficulties
arose
because
of
the
extent
to
which
I
procrastinated
with
regard
to
the
work
of
preparing
for
my
weekly
papers
(by
doing
the
readings
during
the
week,
taking
time
to
work-through
alternative
analyses,
etc.),
this
distaste
for
writing
the
papers
only
made
the
situation
worse.
Besides
these
audience-issues
and
preparation-issues,
however,
there
were
also
issues
with
regard
to
the
technical
nature
of
this
writing.
I
had
looked
forward
to
my
classes
with
this
professor
to
help
me
practice
writing
logically
rigorous
papers
in
a
professional
tone.
While
I
met
with
some
success
in
this
regard,
this
expectation
also
added
to
my
consternation
with
the
professor:
I
wanted
to
write
professional
papers;
as
the
semester
progressed,
I
was
reminded
again
and
again
that
these
were
academic
papers,
the
key-feature
of
which
is
their
confinement
to
the
audience
and
expectations
of
the
same
individual
that
compels
the
student
to
write.
I
felt
this
compulsion
more
and
more
acutely
as
the
semester
progressed.
It
is
the
feeling
of
sitting
down
and
knowing
that
you
have
to
somehow
produce
x
number
of
pages
before
such-and-such
a
time
tomorrow
afternoon
while
desperately
wanting
to
do
anything
but
precisely
that.
It
is
not
just
laziness,
and
it
is
not
just
childishness.
Rather,
I
think
it
has
to
do
with
unique
features
of
writing
-
in
particular,
the
extent
to
which
it
is
a
personal
act
("personal"
in
the
sense
that
it
calls-forth
an
emotional
investment,
that
we
think
of
it
as
an
articulation
on
the
page
of
our
words
or
voice).
I
think
that
it
is
for
this
reason
that
I
find
it
easier
to
write
a
page
of
uninspiring
equations
than
to
write
a
page
of
dull
sentences.
But
whatever
the
reason,
the
sensation
is
undeniable.
So,
for
a
number
of
reasons,
I
found
my
experience
with
this
professor
very
trying.
What
is
more,
I
also
found
myself
committed
to
writing
a
term
paper
for
him
on
a
subject
that
I
only
gradually
began
to
realize
was
far
beyond
my
understanding.
Though
I
was
able,
with
some
reluctant
and
less
than
timely
research,
to
discover
some
aspects
of
the
topic
which
I
could
speak
about
without
making
a
complete
fool
of
myself,
it
was
a
very
unpleasant
experience
to
find
myself
forced
to
write
on
a
topic
with
regard
to
which
my
ignorance
was
so
manifestly
acute.
It
strikes
me
that
this
predicament
is
categorically
that
of
the
student.
It
also
strikes
me
that
perhaps
this
is
at
the
root
of
why
so
many
students
consider
their
writing
to
be
bs.
Despite
my
unpleasant
experiences,
I
received
good
grades
in
both
of
my
classes
with
him
-
good
enough
that
I
wonder
in
retrospect
whether
I
deserved
them.
Although
I
was
in
many
ways
frustrated
with
him,
I
still
respected
his
judgment
and
his
criticisms
of
my
papers.
Sometimes,
when
he
pointed
out
a
genuine
confusion
on
my
part
with
regard
to
the
content
of
my
paper
(i.e.
with
regard
to
my
analysis
of
a
particular
paper),
he
also
commented
that
this
confusion
was
also
evident
in
the
writing
of
my
paper.
Though
some
of
my
papers
were
labeled
wrong
but
well-written,
he
described
some
simple
as
confused.
It
his
evaluations
of
this
sort
that
I
think
I
trust
the
most.
This
bears
out
in
the
arena
of
my
own
writing
something
that
I
have
often
seen
in
the
writing
of
others
through
my
work
as
a
WA:
when
a
writer
is
having
trouble
understanding
what
he
or
she
is
writing
about,
the
quality
of
his
or
her
writing
deteriates
quickly.
This
bears
out
what
has
long
been
my
practice
with
my
writers:
when
the
writing
is
truly
garbled,
it
is
a
sign
that
you
need
to
talk
about
the
basic
ideas
at
issue.
It
is
also
almost
always
a
sign
that
the
writer
needs
to
spend
more
time
thinking
about
the
relevant
ideas
and/or
needs
to
talk
with
their
professor
about
these
ideas.
But
this
brings
me
back
to
the
issue
that
is
at
the
core
of
my
troubles
with
my
professor
-
my
uncomfortableness
with
him.
The
student-teacher
relationship
is
a
complicated,
often
deeply
awkward
one;
at
least
it
is
for
this
student.
The
way
this
experience
has
influenced
me
as
a
WA
(or,
conversely,
that
my
work
as
a
WA
has
influenced
this
experience)
has
to
do
with
an
increased
appreciation
of
the
pains
that
some
of
my
students
suffer
and
the
extent
to
which
an
academic
paper
is
flavored
and
colored
by
the
student-teacher
relationship.
It
also
reminds
me
how
quickly
a
student's
writing
can
suffer
when
he
or
she
decides
that
Prof.
So-and-so
is
just
out
to
get
me/doesn't
like
me/doesn't
know
what
he's
talking
about,
not
to
mention
how
the
student's
learning
can
then
suffer
-
and
this
is
something
that
I
have
certainly
seen
bom-out
in
my
work
as
a
WA.
Though
I
did
not
fall
entirely
prey
to
this
effect,
I
felt
some
of
the
related
effects.
And
all
of
this
reminds
me
of
the
why
academic
writing,
despite
all
of
these
inherent
difficulties,
remains
a
standard
college
activity:
it
is
a
powerful
tool
for
expanding
and
challenging
the
understanding.
Our
activities
as
WA's
can
be
to
help
buoy-up
this
function,
to
encourage
our
student-writers
to
keep
working
at
it
and
to
take
it
seriously
-
at
least
seriously
enough
-
to
gain
from
it.
Now,
since
I
have
been
speaking
about
the
personal
aspect
of
academic
writing,
it
seems
appropriate
to
move
from
that
subject
to
the
subject
of
my
personal
writing.
In
the
past
year,
I
have
come
to
write
more
and
more
for
myself
alone.
Although
I
do
not
keep
a
journal
per
se,
I
keep
a
notebook,
several
note-pads,
and
a
number
of
note-cards
in
which
and
on
which
I
write
whenever
I
feel
the
need
or
desire
so
to
do.
This
habit
is
linked
with
my
growing
collection
of
pens
and
pencils.
In
these
notebooks
and
other
places,
I
write
passages
from
books
and
magazines
that
strike
me,
thoughts
that
occur
to
me,
dreams,
fantasies,
worries
-
anything
that
I
feel
like
writing
down.
I
do
not
think
that
this
practice
has
had
any
particular
influence
on
my
other
writing
(with
one
exception),
or
that
it
has
any
significant
relation
to
my
work
as
a
WA.
It
does,
however,
have
everything
to
do
with
my
existence
as
a
literate
being
-
a
person
who
can
both
read
and
write.
Indeed,
it
is
in
one
of
my
notebooks
that
I
recorded
my
realization
one
day
that
being
literate
consists
of
both
of
these
activities
-
and
perhaps
this
does,
after-all,
bring
me
back
to
my
work
as
a
WA.
Here,
the
phenomenon
of
which
I
would
like
to
speak
is
the
way
that
my
personal
writing
is
a
confirmation
and
exploration
of
the
way
in
which
our
written
words
are
more
than
simple
recordings
of
our
words,
and
through
them
our
thoughts.
For
in
this
context,
as
well
as
in
my
academic
writing
(both
in
this
semester
and
in
previous
ones),
I
have
experienced
the
way
in
which
the
act
of
writing
my
thoughts
shapes
my
thoughts.
What
I
choose
to
write
on
my
note-cards
or
in
my
notebooks
has
a
way
of
coalescing
in
my
mind,
but
only
momentarily.
It
is
a
fleeting
performance,
the
expression
at
that
particular
moment
of
that
particular
piece
of
my
consciousness
(or
even
subconsciousness).
And
not
every
thought
(every
serious
or
big
thought)
that
I
have
is
ready
on
my
first
entertaining
it
for
me
to
feel
ready
to
record
it.
Although
I
do
not
revise
my
private
writing,
it
has
helped
me
understand
my
own
writing
as
a
process
-
and
as
open
to
improvement
as
a
feature
of
its
momentariness,
of
its
arbitrariness.
I
think
this
has
helped
me
appreciate
the
writing-act
on
a
deeper
level;
it
has
also
given
me
a
perspective
on
the
written
word
which
aides
me
both
in
meeting
with
student-writers
and
in
reading
the
works
of
bona
fide
writers.
Now,
finally,
I
turn
to
that
one
aspect
of
my
private
writing
that
has
had
more
public
manifestations
in
my
writing-performances,
namely
my
attempts
at
writing
poetry.
Having
been
inspired
by
an
honorable
mention
in
a
poetry
contest
in
the
spring
semester
of
my
sophomore
year,
in
the
past
year
I
continued
to
write
poems
(or
more
often,
poem-fragments)
in
my
notebooks
and
to
seek
some
public
recognition
for
them.
This
type
of
writing
has
grown
to
be
a
significant
percentage
of
my
private
writing,
and
perhaps
the
single
aspect
of
my
writing
which
has
both
most
excited
and
most
frustrated
me.
I
find
myself
in
long
spells
of
poetic
inactivity,
punctuated
by
sudden
outbursts
of,
for
lack
of
a
better
word,
inspiration,
in
which
I
produce
a
number
of
pieces
or
ideas
for
pieces
at
a
time.
Another
aspect
of
this
writing
that
has
deeply
troubled
me
is
the
process
of
revision.
Although
I
have
trouble
coming
up
with
meaningful
revisions
even
for
my
academic
papers,
I
am
even
less
able
to
effectively
weed-out
the
good
from
the
bad
in
my
poetic
writing.
Even
though
I
find
myself
better
able
to
offer
suggestions
for
revision
for
the
prose
of
my
writers
and
better
able
to
distinguish
between
published
poetry
that
I
like
and
that
I
dislike,
I
find
myself
unable
to
transfer
these
skills
to
either
my
own
prose
or
my
own
verse.
While
this
does
not
terribly
concern
myself
with
regard
to
my
prose,
I
know
that
my
poetry
will
not
develop
if
I
cannot
learn
this
skill;
and
thus,
in
this
context,
the
issue
of
revision
and
drafting
is
of
great
concern
to
me.
Of
course,
the
implications
of
this
for
my
work
as
a
WA
(or
vice
versa)
are
not
terribly
clear.
A
WA
who
typically
works
with
philosophy
professors
does
not
got
opportunities
to
revise
poetry.
Perhaps
this
work
has
contributed
to
my
revision-skills,
but
it
would
be
rather
hard
to
show
that
this
was
clearly
the
case.
More
likely,
I
think
the
contribution
of
this
aspect
of
my
writing
to
my
work
as
a
WA
is
an
appreciation
of
the
difficulties,
challenges
and
rewards
of
the
written
word
and
a
renewed
belief
in
the
value
of
helping
people
to
focus
the
attention
and
energy
on
writing.
I
do
not
think
there
is
any
more
vital
piece
to
being
a
WA
than
this;
believing
in
the
value
and
power
of
writing
to
communicate,
to
express
ourselves
and
to
expand
our
minds
is
the
best
reason
to
do
this
work
and
the
best
way
of
giving
yourself
the
strength
to
persevere
in
this
work
in
those
times
when
it
seems
a
mere
exercise,
a
chore
or
a
lost
cause.
Perhaps
the
faith
of
a
WA
is
too
grandiose;
then
again,
perhaps
not.
