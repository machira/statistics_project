Literacy
Narrative
Before
I
was
even
in
elementary
school,
I
used
to
make
comic
books
based
on
the
NTeenage
Mutant
Ninja
TurtlesO
cartoons
and
NGhostbustersO
movies
I
used
to
watch.
I
scribbled
the
pictures,
but,
because
I
couldnOt
write
yet,
my
Mom
had
to
write
the
captions
for
me.
Still,
(I
think)
she
wrote
exactly
what
I
told
her,
and
so
in
that
sense
I
was
using
language
to
tell
the
stories.
This
was
my
first
experience
with
writing.
Today,
as
a
college
student,
I
still
use
writing
for
creative
purposes.
In
many
ways,
the
ability
to
express
myself
through
writing
is
what
I
enjoy
most
about
it.
But
in
between
writing
comics
and
being
a
college
student,
there
were
many
years
of
my
education
in
which
writing
was
little
more
than
an
academic
discipline
like
math
or
science.
I
remember
learning
how
to
physically
write
in
elementary
school.
For
some
reason,
at
my
elementary
school,
there
was
a
huge
emphasis
on
all
students
learning
to
write
in
cursive.
We
had
a
workbook
with
practice
pages
for
writing
every
letter
of
the
alphabet
in
cursive.
After
we
learned
the
proper
technique
for
writing
each
letter,
we
had
to
practice
by
filling
page
after
page
with
each
letter.
After
that,
we
learned
to
combine
letters
into
words,
words
into
sentences,
etc.
(In
retrospect,
this
emphasis
on
perfecting
how
to
writing
in
cursive
seems
a
bit
pointless.
Most
people
I
know
stopped
writing
in
cursive
by
middle
school.
Today,
the
only
thing
I
write
in
cursive
is
my
signature.)
I
have
never
had
good
handwriting,
cursive
or
printed.
My
head
always
moved
faster
than
my
pen,
and
I
have
always
cared
more
about
getting
things
down
than
getting
them
down
neatly.
As
a
result,
my
handwriting
is
generally
sloppy
and
occasionally
unreadable.
I
also
write
too
small.
Most
of
the
time,
my
letters
take
up
less
than
a
quarter
of
the
margin.
Word
processing
is
a
godsend
to
me,
because
I
can
type
fast
as
I
can
think
and
the
words
still
look
neat
on
the
screen.
Microsoft
Word
has
made
my
writing
process,
which
involves
a
lot
of
revision,
a
lot
easier
in
high
school
and
college.
I
used
to
hate
handing
in
handwritten
assignments
because
I
hate
handing
in
sloppy
work.
That
meant
I
had
to
focus
on
writing
neat,
and
even
then
only
the
first
few
letters
came
out
neat
and
large
enough
before
I
reverted
to
my
usual
style
and
the
rest
had
to
be
translated.
In
elementary
and
middle
school,
I
used
writing
mainly
as
a
means
of
answering
history
questions,
writing
book
reports,
etc.
Writing
became
the
way
in
which
I
conveyed
more
important
information.
Writing
well
was
less
important
than
the
knowledge
about
other
subjects
that
it
conveyed.
In
my
history
classes,
for
example,
the
presence
of
certain
facts
in
my
answer
to
what
factors
caused
the
Civil
War
was
more
important
than
how
I
constructed
my
response.
Even
in
my
English
classes,
there
was
not
much
emphasis
on
writing
or
writing
creatively.
We
did
have
lessons
on
how
to
structure
an
essay
and
on
the
different
types
of
writing,
but
I
recall
a
distinct
emphasis
on
understanding
literature
as
opposed
to
writing
well
in
most
of
my
English
classes
through
high
school.
Of
course,
one
also
learns
to
write
by
reading,
but
basic
grammar
skills
and
vocabulary
were
not
taught
nearly
as
much
as
they
should
be,
in
my
opinion.
I
had
a
teacher
in
tenth
grade
who
insisted
that
not
enough
emphasis
was
placed
on
grammar
in
my
school
districtOs
English
curriculum,
and
I
agree.
I
imagine
that
this
is
the
case
across
the
country.
I
have
proofread
papers
for
fellow
Lafayette
students
and
been
amazed
to
find
elementary
spelling
and
punctuation
errors
in
their
writing.
Lafayette
is
widely
considered
a
top
level
academic
institution,
and
it
amazes
me
that
some
students
here
have
no
grasp
on
basic
grammar.
This
has
helped
me
to
realize
how
important
writing
well
is.
It
doesnOt
matter
how
smart
the
personOs
ideas
are
D
if
they
are
presented
with
the
grammar
of
the
third
grader,
I
cannot
take
them
seriously,
and
I
do
not
see
how
anyone
else
could.
I
lucked
out
because
I
read
a
lot
on
my
own
and
I
have
always
had
a
natural
grasp
on
grammar.
For
some
reason,
I
have
an
eye
for
it.
For
the
most
part,
I
can
look
at
a
sentence
and
immediately
spot
a
grammar
error.
I
may
have
no
explanation
for
why
itOs
wrong,
but
IOll
know
that
itOs
wrong.
I
remember
getting
only
two
questions
wrong
and
scoring
in
the
99th
percentile
on
the
writing
section
of
the
PSAT
I
took
in
high
school.
At
this
point,
the
College
Board
was
trying
out
the
writing
section,
deciding
whether
or
not
to
add
it
to
the
SAT.
I
cursed
my
luck
when
they
added
this
writing
section
to
the
SAT
only
a
year
after
I
took
it.
I
can
only
imagine
how
much
higher
my
score
would
be
on
this
new
version.
In
this
sense,
I
was
prepared
for
college
writing
by
natural
ability
and
not
necessarily
by
my
schools.
My
schools
certainly
prepared
me
to
some
degree
(I
will
later
discuss
my
11th
grade
AP
English
class
in
which
I
learned
a
lot
about
how
to
write
on
a
Ncollegiate
levelO),
but
I
realize
that
not
many
students
have
the
natural
ability
that
I
do
or
took
the
advanced
English
classes
in
high
school
that
I
did.
In
a
certain
sense,
I
think
the
WA
system
at
Lafayette
exists
as
it
does
because
of
a
failure
on
the
part
of
our
school
systems
to
teach
students
how
to
write
effectively.
The
WA
system
would
certainly
have
a
place
on
campus
even
if
students
were
adequately
prepared.
Everyone
can
write
better,
and
having
another,
trained
pair
of
eyes
to
read
and
edit
a
paper
is
helpful
to
anyone
and
everyone,
even
the
WAOs
themselves.
However,
the
WA
system
might
be
able
to
focus
more
on
making
a
good
paper
better
and
helping
students
take
their
writing
to
the
next
level
if
there
werenOt
so
many
students
that
need
help
expressing
their
ideas
in
a
grammatically
correct
sense.
I
think
it
was
right
around
the
time
that
I
took
the
PSATS
that
I
realized
I
might
have
some
skill
as
a
writer
and
a
student
of
English.
In
elementary
and
middle
school,
I
tried
hard
and
did
well
in
all
of
my
subjects
D
math,
science,
English,
and
history.
But
as
the
math
and
science
got
harder,
I
found
myself
struggling
in
them
and
doing
much
better
in
English
and
History
classes.
In
high
school,
I
decided
to
focus
on
English.
To
be
honest,
part
of
the
reason
I
decided
to
do
this
was
because
it
was
the
subject
I
thought
that
I
was
the
NbestO
at,
and
I
rarely
do
anything
unless
I
think
I
can
succeed.
I
never
had
any
great
interest
in
or
adoration
of
literature,
which
was
the
focus
of
most
of
my
English
classes
throughout
high
school.
And
I
had
no
real
passion
for
writing
in
the
NtechnicalO
sense,
which
was
mostly
what
I
had
learned
up
to
that
point.
For
the
most
part,
English
was
simply
the
subject
I
minded
the
least.
So
I
followed
the
AP
track
in
English
(and
also
in
history,
but
only
because
I
also
did
well
in
history)
and
the
NregularO
tracks
in
math
and
science.
In
high
school,
the
curriculum
finally
focused
on
writing
and
I
learned
more
than
ever
before
about
how
to
write
well.
Up
to
this
point,
I
had
only
learned
the
traditional
five
part
essay
format
(introduction
and
thesis,
three
supporting
paragraphs,
defense
of
rebuttal,
and
summary)
and
I
had
been
instructed
to
apply
it
like
a
scientific
formula
to
every
paper
I
wrote.
Finally,
in
my
11th
grade
AP
class,
we
focused
on
advanced
writing
and
composition.
In
this
class
and
on
the
AP
National
Exam,
we
also
had
to
construct
essay
answers
to
college
level
questions.
By
reading
good
and
bad
responses
to
the
prompts
that
we
practiced
in
class
and
writing
my
own
responses
to
the
questions,
I
began
to
learn
that
in
order
to
write
more
thoughtful
responses,
I
would
need
to
write
outside
of
the
5
paragraph
essay
that
was
standard
for
middle
school-level
essays.
By
learning
more
mature
writing
techniques,
I
learned
both
to
think
more
critically
and
how
to
express
these
thoughts
in
a
more
sophisticated
manner
(I
have
found
that
these
two
skills
often
go
hand
in
hand).
In
this
class,
we
learned
about
different
types
of
writing
through
assignments
which
included
a
cause
and
effect
essay,
an
observational
essay,
an
extended
metaphor
essay,
and
finally
a
20
page
position
paper,
a
year-long
assignment
that
included
extensive
research
to
formulate
a
thesis
and
a
defense
of
that
thesis
to
our
classmates.
For
the
observational
assignment,
I
observed
the
different
cliques
in
the
cafeteria
courtyard.
I
remember
liking
this
particular
assignment
because
the
topic
meant
something
to
me
and
I
was
able
to
manipulate/edit
what
I
observed
to
support
my
opinion.
It
was
creative
non-fiction,
and
I
enjoyed
the
opportunity
to
write
something
that
had
some
semblance
of
a
narrative.
I
was
also
able
to
learn
different
types
of
writing
outside
of
my
English
classes.
In
11th
grade,
I
started
taking
journalism
classes
and
writing
for
the
school
newspaper.
I
wrote
mostly
entertainment
articles,
including
movie
reviews,
restaurant
reviews,
and
TV
features.
I
had
fun
exploring
a
topic
I
liked
and
using
language
to
inform
or
persuade
my
reader
of
my
opinion.
Because
I
wrote
mostly
entertainment
articles,
I
was
also
allowed
to
write
in
a
more
playful,
funny
voice
that
I
had
fun
creating
and
perfecting.
In
eleventh
grade,
I
also
wrote
a
pilot
for
a
television
show
for
my
graduation
project.
The
state
of
Pennsylvania
had
passed
a
law
mandating
that
every
high
school
student
complete
a
project
in
an
area
of
interest
that
applied
some
of
what
we
had
learned
in
the
classroom.
Writing
this
pilot
was
the
ultimate
form
of
creative
writing
and
personal
expression
through
writing
that
I
had
experienced
up
to
that
point.
I
had
a
lot
of
fun
researching
the
format
of
TV
screenplays,
the
typical
plot
structure,
how
to
develop
characters,
how
to
write
dialogue,
etc.
and
applying
this
research
to
my
own
story.
The
pilot
was
a
story
about
a
studentOs
first
day
of
high
school
that
basically
ended
up
stealing
my
favorite
aspects
of
NBoy
Meets
World,O
my
favorite
show
growing
up,
and
NScrubs,O
my
favorite
show
at
the
time.
IOve
grown
so
much
as
a
writer
since
11th
grade
that
IOm
embarrassed
to
call
that
script
my
own,
but
as
of
a
year
ago
D
the
last
time
I
read
it
over
D
there
are
some
great
moments
and
some
parts
that
still
make
me
laugh
(with
it,
that
is,
not
at
it).
These
more
personal
and
expressive
types
of
writing
are
what
really
turned
me
on
to
the
subject.
I
liked
the
idea
of
using
writing
to
affect
somebody,
as
I
had
tried
to
in
my
pilot.
I
liked
using
language
to
convince
people
of
how
I
felt
or
what
I
thought.
And
because
I
think
I
have
a
pretty
good
handle
on
the
language,
writing
is
by
far
the
best
way
I
have
of
expressing
myself
and
my
opinions.
I
have
never
been
particularly
effective
at
communicating
orally
or
thinking
on
my
feet.
But
in
my
writing,
I
can
be
articulate,
persuasive
in
ways
that
I
cannot
in
oral
conversation.
I
have
a
different
voice
in
my
writing.
I
find
similar
satisfaction
in
convincing
my
audience
of
my
point
of
view
for
essays
at
Lafayette.
I
enjoy
formulating
a
thesis
and
trying
to
convince
my
audience
of
it
in
an
essay
to
be
one
of
the
most
fun
and
satisfactory
aspects
of
my
college
education.
In
college,
I
have
had
opportunities
to
improve
my
technique
in
all
different
aspects
of
writing.
Mostly,
I
have
learned
how
to
effectively
develop
and
support
these
written
theses
for
topics
in
literature
and
in
Anthropology
and
Sociology.
I
have
learned
to
adapt
the
discourse
of
Nthe
universityO
that
Bartholomae
discusses
and
of
the
essayists
I
have
read
to
my
own
opinions
and
theses.
I
have
also
had
the
opportunity
to
learn
more
about
how
to
write
creatively
in
a
creative
writing
course,
to
write
a
newsletter
for
my
fraternity,
and
to
write
some
articles
for
The
Lafayette.
And
I
have
continued
to
learn
about
how
to
write
from
reading
D
novels,
articles,
essays,
poems,
etc.
To
say
I
have
learned
how
to
Nwrite
betterO
is
a
drastic
understatement.
The
best
way
that
I
can
put
it
is
that,
coming
out
of
high
school,
I
felt
like
a
student
who
could
write
well.
On
the
brink
of
my
senior
year
of
college,
I
feel
like
a
writer.
But
NwriterO
is
a
complex
term
because
of
the
different
aspects
of
writing
D
academic
and
personal
D
that
I
have
discussed
(although
NacademicO
and
NpersonalO
can
overlap
in
many
ways
D
I
can
learn
to
write
better
essays
through
exercises
in
NcreativeO
writing
like
I
can
express
a
personal
feeling
through
a
thesis
in
an
academic
essay,
for
example
D
the
two
will
always
remain
separate
to
me).
In
one
sense,
I
am
a
student
of
English,
and
I
write
for
assignments
as
part
of
my
education
in
how
to
write
that
will
presumably
(but
not
necessarily)
lead
to
a
career
that
utilizes
these
skills
in
some
fashion.
In
this
sense,
writing
is
a
skill
I
have
learned,
like
addition
and
subtraction,
and
NwriterO
a
potential
career.
At
a
time
when
I
am
beginning
to
weigh
different
post-collegiate
career
options,
this
marketable
skill
can
now
be
a
potential
path
towards
different
careers
in
which
writing
is
involved
D
technical
writer,
lawyer,
copywriter,
journalist,
etc.
But
my
writing
has
also
become
a
means
of
expression;
an
outlet
for
the
creativity
that
I
have
had
since
I
made
the
NNinja
TurtlesO
and
NGhostbustersO
comics
when
I
was
a
kid
and
that
I
was
able
to
exercise
as
the
NwriterO
of
the
TV
pilot.
And
although
it
is
possible,
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
this
creative
writing
will
ultimately
become
a
career.
Regardless,
this
more
personal
type
of
writing
will
always
be
the
type
of
writing
that
I
enjoy
the
most.
Whether
or
not
I
ultimately
end
up
writing
for
a
living,
for
me,
writing
can
always
be
an
outlet
for
personal
expression.
