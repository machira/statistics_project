A
Personal
Narrative:
I
Wish
I
Was
An
Autobiography
Writing
Associate
Training
Due
August
18,
2003
I
have
to
be
honest;
writing
has
never
been
my
forte
and
perhaps
never
will.
A
history
of
my
literary
growth
may
provide
more
a
psychiatric
breakdown
than
personal
narrative.
Maybe
I
could
utilize
my
historical
accounts
and
improve
my
writing.
Perhaps
the
next
Mark
Twain
is
materializing
before
your
eyesE..As
always,
reality
has
set
in;
I
am
still
sitting
in
front
of
my
monitor
watching
the
remains
of
a
tattered
Mets
season
months
past
hope,
and
poetry
is
not
flowing
from
my
fingers
onto
the
monitor.
Then
again,
I
thought
my
days
of
writing
narratives
were
further
behind
me
than
MetallicaOs
glory
days.
Anything
is
possible.
When
I
was
younger
I
never
pictured
myself
as
an
author.
My
early
literary
dreams
led
me
down
the
road
of
Chuck
Jones
and
Bill
Watterson.
I
pictured
myself
staring
at
a
white
piece
of
paper
drawing
comics
for
the
remainder
of
my
adult
life;
that
is
until
I
realized
I
did
not
have
any
artistic
talent.
Chances
are,
my
comic
would
have
been
the
best
drawn
stick
figure,
but
not
The
New
Yorker
material.
Fate
intervened
in
kindergarten;
my
teachers,
Mrs.
Schwarz
and
Mrs.
Lorenzi,
gave
each
of
her
students
a
blank
book
to
write
a
narrative
about
an
activity,
or
activities,
we
performed
during
the
past
few
weeks
adding
pictures
to
each
page
to
complement
the
story.
Amazingly
my
father
held
on
to
a
few
of
the
books
and
I
was
able
to
snicker
at
its
childish
nature,
until
I
realized
I
was
reading
a
paper
I
wrote
last
semester.
The
following
year
my
first
grade
teacher
learned
about
these
books
and
purchased
some
herself.
Once
again,
I
delved
into
my
literary
youth
but
only
scraped
the
surface
of
creativity.
My
teacher
only
asked
us
to
account
for
recent
life
experiences
(sounds
familiar)
which
only
provided,
in
retrospect,
evidence
of
grammatical
maturity,
and
nothing
more.
The
more
I
turned
the
pages
of
these
accounts
the
more
I
realized
I
was
looking
through
my
eyes,
recalling
my
youth
and
reminiscing
of
the
old
days.
Grammatical
errors
flooded
each
page
and
sentence
structures
were
bland
without
much
hope
of
repair
but
nevertheless
I
felt
obliged
to
critique
it.
One
reoccurring
mistake
I
noticed
was
my
heavy
reliance
on
the
transition
Nthen.O
I
used
that
word
to
start
4
out
of
every
5
of
my
sentences.
Perhaps
here
is
where
one
would
find
my
literary
Achilles
Heel;
my
lack
of
sentence
variation.
Even
now
I
see
myself
cringing
at
the
revision
stage
because
of
all
the
work
needed
to
groom
this
paper.
After
a
few
year
hiatus,
my
next
literary
memory
picked
itself
up
in
3rd
grade
when
I
started
to
write
creatively.
The
year
was
1990
and
Steven
Spielberg
released
one
of
his
many
blockbusters,
Jurassic
Park.
My
family
and
two
family
friends
had
three
adjoining
houses
in
the
Poconos.
Our
three
families
would
spend
each
weekend
during
the
summer
and
winter
in
the
Poconos.
As
a
result,
I
became
close
friends
with
their
2
children,
Rocky
and
Adrian,
who
are
5
and
3
years
older
than
me,
respectively.
The
two
of
them,
coupled
together
with
myself
and
my
older
brother
had
a
fixation
on
space
and
the
final
frontier
(Fear
not,
there
is
a
point).
Our
nights
were
spent
staring
at
the
stars
attempting
to
decipher
whether
a
moving
speck
was
a
shooting
star
of
a
UFO.
This
brief
anecdote
outlines
the
reasoning
behind
my
first
creative
story.
My
4th
grade
teacher
wanted
us
to
write
a
short
creative
story
about
whatever
we
wanted.
I
decided
to
write
NUFO
Park.O
The
reasoning
behind
my
paper
is
contained
in
the
aforementioned
paragraph.
I
sat
down
in
class,
took
out
my
college
ruled
paper
and
pencil,
and
started
to
write.
The
plot
mirrored
Jurassic
ParkOs
replacing
dinosaurs
with
UFOs.
I
kept
the
same
characters
and
general
gist
of
the
movie;
needless
to
say
it
was
not
a
creative
piece
of
art
but
I
was
proud
of
it.
Twelve
pages
later
my
story
was
done.
I
gave
my
teacher
ten
pages
more
than
what
she
asked
for
and
she
gave
me
an
A-
for
my
efforts
(it
would
have
received
an
A
if
I
kept
to
the
page
limit).
Sadly
enough,
I
would
label
NUFO
ParkO
my
most
cherished
literary
piece.
Since
that
day,
I
have
never
been
confident
in
my
writing.
Some
days
it
feels
like
my
literary
career
was
journeying
up
a
mountain
attempting
to
reach
new
heights
when
all
of
a
sudden
it
found
a
detour
and
has
been
on
the
same
plateau
for
years.
My
lack
of
confidence
stayed
with
me
through
middle
school,
carried
on
through
high
school
and
even
college.
My
high
school
offered
honors
courses
and
Advanced
Placement
courses
(Junior
and
Senior
year)
in
literature
but
because
of
my
insecurities
I
was
afraid
to
improve
my
literary
standing
and
began
to
accept
my
miniscule
literary
talent.
I
always
received
high
marks
in
my
freshman
and
sophomore
year
standard
high
school
English
chasses
but
never
was
fully
satisfied.
Sometime
during
the
middle
of
my
sophomore
year,
I
decided
I
would
challenge
myself
and
apply
for
an
Honors
Literature
course.
They
accepted
me
and
a
week
later
handed
an
envelope
containing
my
summer
assignment,
read
two
novels
and
compare
and
contrast
the
heroines
of
each.
Procrastination
got
the
best
of
me
and
being
the
ignorant,
unconfident
literary
child
I
was,
I
decided
to
corroborate
with
my
friend
on
the
paper.
As
it
turned
out,
my
first
paper
ever
in
Honors
Literature
was
sent
to
the
department
head
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
my
friend
and
I
should
be
brought
up
on
charges
of
academic
dishonesty.
In
the
end
I
performed
so
poorly
on
the
paper
the
department
head
found
the
argument
to
be
moot
and
let
us
both
stay
in
the
course.
My
insecurities
almost
ruined
not
only
my
high
school
career,
but
also
my
friendOs.
*Knock
on
wood*
it
was
the
last
time
I
cheated,
but
lowered
my
confidence
even
more.
Defining
moments
sporadically
occur
in
oneOs
life
and
junior
year
in
high
school
decided
to
spring
a
few
defining
moments
at
me
all
at
once.
Not
only
is
it
the
last
year
before
you
send
out
college
applications
but
is
also
when
most
college-bound
students
take
the
SATs
(Or
ACT
for
those
westerners).
Mathematics
never
was
a
problem
for
me
so
I
never
feared
that
section
of
the
SATs,
but
Vegas
had
a
line
on
how
well
I
was
going
to
do,
400
or
below
paid
$1.01
on
a
one
dollar
bet
and
above
a
700
paid
$1000
on
a
one
dollar
bet.
I
went
to
the
Princeton
Review
course
in
a
pathetic
attempt
to
boost
my
score
but
I
knew
well
going
into
the
test
that
I
was
going
to
need
my
math
score
to
carry
me
into
college.
If
I
were
a
betting
man
I
would
have
won
the
jackpot
because
my
math
score
carried
my
SATs.
Evidence
of
my
horrible
reading
comprehension
skills
did
not
end
with
the
SATs.
My
first
three
college
choices,
Boston
College,
UPenn,
and
Lafayette
all
required
two
SAT
II
exams.
I
took
the
Math
II
exam
and
the
Reading
exam.
As
usual,
I
scored
highly
on
my
Math
exam
(720)
and
poorly
on
my
Reading
exam
(480).
Most
people
would
look
at
these
occurrences
as
a
sign,
a
sign
telling
me
reading
should
not
dictate
my
life
because
then
I
would
not
know
what
I
was
saying.
Stubbornness
though,
runs
rampant
through
my
family
and
alas
it
found
its
way
into
me.
Whenever
I
see
a
challenge
or
a
flaw
I
attempt
to
alleviate
or
at
least
improve
on
it
instead
of
cower
away.
I
guess
this
is
why
I
stayed
in
Honors
Literature.
After
my
hard-core
college
exams
were
over,
my
teacher
decided
to
assign
a
30
page
research
paper.
The
details
of
the
paper
are
a
blur
but
she
required
at
least
50
hand
written
note
cards
to
be
used
for
writing
our
papers.
The
content
of
the
paper
is
irrelevant
but
it
was
important
in
my
literary
history
to
note
the
use
of
note
cards
during
my
paperOs
construction.
This
research
paper
taught
me
one
thing;
how
to
better
organize
my
research
and
thoughts
for
a
paper.
Before
this
paper,
I
never
organized
my
notes
or
thoughts,
I
would
write
impromptu.
After
this
paper
and
Honors
Literature
I
found
writing
papers
(content
wise)
easier
because
I
had
a
general
direction
and
posts
leading
my
way.
Once
I
turned
in
my
paper
I
felt
like
my
confidence
was
slowing
eking
its
way
back
into
my
writing
and
I
would
perhaps
regain
my
old
self.
Someone
up
above
decided
to
let
me
ride
my
high
horse
right
into
a
wall.
The
wallOs
name
was
AP
Literature.
AP
Lit
turned
out
to
arguably
be
my
hardest
high
school
class.
The
only
reason
I
mention
this
brief
yet
ultimately
insignificant
benchmark
in
my
life
was
to
relay
my
AP
score,
which
was
a
2
(Big
surprise
there).
Wow,
only
after
writing
this
narrative
do
I
realize
how
poorly
I
performed
on
all
exams
relating
to
literature.
Now,
while
I
proofread
this
narrative
I
finally
realize
how
poorly
I
write.
But
I
digressE
The
two
largest
growths
in
my
literary
career
occurred
during
my
freshman
and
sophomore
years
at
Lafayette
College.
My
College
Writing
professor
(nameless)
provided
me
with
my
first
actual
college
test.
College
Writing
academically
challenged
me
as
well
as
revealed
my
minute
literary
skills.
The
papers
were
unique
in
content
and
challenged
my
style
of
writing,
a
challenge
I
was
not
able
to
meet.
Throughout
my
life,
if
a
new
situation
presents
itself
I
take
time
to
adjust
but
usually
perform
well
after
adjusting.
The
unique
assignments
I
was
asked
to
complete
presented
a
new
challenge
for
me
and
instead
of
attacking
it
with
open
arms
I
shunned
from
it.
As
a
result,
I
dreaded
writing
the
papers
and
the
tone
emanated
off
each
page.
My
astute
professor
called
me
out
on
my
writing
and
realized
there
was
more
potential
in
my
writing
than
I
was
exerting.
He/She
pulled
me
aside,
asked
me
why
my
paper
was
so
bland,
and
I
answered,
NItOs
because
I
get
bored
every
time
I
begin
to
write.O
Most
of
my
life
I
have
had
low
esteem
in
my
writing
and
as
a
result
found
it
to
be
drag
more
than
anything
else.
My
professor
told
me
I
should
try
to
get
myself
in
the
mood
to
write.
At
first
I
looked
awkwardly
at
my
professorOs
advice
until
I
realized
he/she
was
telling
me
instead
of
writing
a
paper
impromptu,
I
should
start
writing
in
advance
and
only
write
it
when
I
felt
ready
and
interested.
Before
College
Writing,
I
felt
writing
a
paper
entailed
sitting
down
and
hammering
one
out.
College
Writing
taught
me
time
and
effort
must
be
given
to
each
paper
to
produce
a
well
written
piece
of
work.
The
final
piece
of
my
current
literary
puzzle
was
put
into
place
during
the
first
semester
of
my
sophomore
year.
My
professor,
who
is
no
longer
with
the
school,
and
I
had
a
strong
relationship
and
therefore
he/she
was
fairly
blunt
and
honest
when
concerns
or
questions
arise.
The
course
was
comprised
of
four
grades,
a
class
presentation,
a
midterm
exam,
a
final
exam,
and
a
15
page
paper.
Obviously
three
of
the
four
factors
are
irrelevant
so
I
will
only
concentrate
on
the
paper.
I
chose
to
write
my
paper
on
the
role
of
females
during
World
War
II
and
directly
after
the
war
during
reconstruction.
At
the
time
I
handed
my
paper
in,
two
of
the
four
major
grades
(save
the
final
exam
and
paper)
were
etched
in
stone,
both
of
which
averaged
out
to
an
A.
When
I
received
my
report
card
at
the
end
of
the
year
I
received
a
B+
as
a
final
grade
and
opted
to
inquire
as
to
why
I
received
that
grade.
He/She
informed
me
my
paper
brought
my
grade
down
(go
figure)
because
of
the
lack
of
direction
it
possessed.
He/She
told
me
my
paper
mirrored
a
book
report
rather
than
a
research
paper
because
I
stated
facts
without
bringing
them
all
together.
My
paper
was
a
regurgitation
of
the
research
I
performed
during
the
previous
month.
My
professorOs
critique
taught
me
to
take
my
time
writing
and
not
only
revise
but
also
add
a
theoretical
element
to
my
thesis
and
paper.
The
biggest
reason
I
wanted
to
become
a
WA
was
to
help
students
realize
the
final
point
I
myself
learned.
Chances
are
a
large
portion
of
incoming
freshman
do
not
know
how
to
properly
write
a
college
paper
using
a
thesis
and
will
run
into
the
same
problems
I
did.
Confidence
has
never
been
a
strong
part
of
my
literature
abilities
throughout
my
life
but
I
have
never
been
known
to
quit.
Just
like
I
did
in
high
school,
I
challenged
myself
in
an
attempt
to
improve
my
writing.
Had
I
not
taken
Honors
Literature,
junior
year,
or
AP
Lit,
senior
year,
I
do
not
believe
I
would
be
where
I
currently
am.
I
know
I
will
not
be
the
best
Writing
Associate
at
Lafayette
College,
but
I
do
feel
that
I
can
provide
the
students
I
WA
for
helpful
insights
to
their
problems.
My
biggest
problem
is
not
thinking
of
ideas
for
my
paper,
it
is
writing
it
down
in
coherent,
varying
sentences.
Varying
sentence
structure
has
plagued
me
for
the
longest
time
and
I
strongly
believe
it
is
because
of
my
small
vocabulary.
This
past
week
I
was
teaching
tennis
to
8
children
ranging
between
the
ages
of
11
and
13.
One
of
the
students
had
such
a
vast
vocabulary
that
sometimes
even
I
would
not
understand
a
word
he
was
using.
Not
only
did
I
find
that
embarrassing
but
I
also
found
it
sad.
It
is
not
that
I
lack
intelligence
or
have
trouble
reading,
I
just
cannot
duplicate
great
writing.
Many
times
my
papers
start
out
strong
because
I
have
time
to
think
about
what
I
am
going
to
write
about
but
after
a
page
or
so
my
sentence
structure
begins
to
level
out
and
become
bland.
My
poorly
developed
writing
abilities
do
not
reflect
in
my
critiquing
of
other
peopleOs
works.
My
literary
career
is
plagued
with
personal
problems
that
do
not
stem
outward,
I
personally
feel
that
I
have
a
fairly
decent
ability
to
read
someoneOs
paper
and
head
them
in
the
right
direction.
I
just
need
to
figure
out
how
to
apply
that
to
my
own
writing.
