Literacy
Narrative
My
first
WA
conference
ever
was
quite
a
memorable
experience.
I
can't
remember
who
was
more
nervous;
me,
having
never
held
a
conference
before
and
who,
in
the
five
minutes
prior
to
the
co
iference
had
convinced
myself
I
knew
nothing
about
writing,
or,
the
first
year
student
I
was
meeting,
who
had
just
survived
her
first
week
of
college
and
was
already
instructed
to
select
a
thesis
for
her
first
FYS
paper,
due
the
second
week
of
classes.
Needless
to
say,
the
atmosphere
was
tense.
I
don't
remember
what
was
said
during
the
conference,
but
I
remember
how
I
felt
at
its
conclusion.
I
felt
as
if
the
semester
stretching
before
me
was
going
to
consist
of
me
systematically
wasting
a
half
hour
of
each
student's
time
for
every
paper
they
had
to
write.
However,
in
actuality
none
of
my
time
spent
in
WA
conferences
was
wasted.
Even
during
the
times
when
I
felt
like
I
wasn't
helping
a
student,
the
conference
turned
into
a
learning
experience
for
me.
The
following
narrative
details
my
progress
from
my
first
WA
conferences,
when
I
was
inexperienced
and
unconfident,
to
the
end
of
the
year
when
I
was
able
to
not
only
hold
more
effective
conferences,
but
also
apply
the
advice
I
was
giving
to
other
students
to
my
own
writing.
However,
after
meeting
with
several
students,
I
began
to
notice
a
pattern
within
their
writings
that
could
perhaps
be
attributed
to
the
assignment
calling
for
selecting
one's
own
thesis.
The
organization
within
most
of
the
papers
began
with
an
incoherent,
rambling
introduction,
followed
by
a
body
of
text
of
variable
quality,
and
then
finally,
a
conclusion
restating
the
main
ideas
of
the
body.
I
empathized
with
the
students
since
introductions
and
conclusions
have
forever
been
my
arch-nemesis
when
it
comes
to
writing
papers
(as
is
hopefully
not
too
painfully
evident
in
this
particular
narrative).
After
struggling
for
years,
I
was
being
required
to
not
only
develop
some
personal
skill
at
writing
these
paragraphs,
but
also
to
be
confident
enough
in
my
knowledge
to
advise
others
on
the
process.
Thus,
here
is
where
I
made
my
first
real
steps
towards
improving
as
a
writer
as
a
result
of
being
a
WA.
As
conferences
progressed,
I
gradually
developed
a
routine
for
assisting
students
with
introductions
and
conclusions,
one
that
eventually
began
to
help
me
with
my
own
writing.
In
the
beginning,
I
simply
had
to
rely
on
my
previous
knowledge
of
the
writing
process
as
my
authority
to
help
writers,
but
as
I
developed
some
skill
in
conducting
conferences,
I
began
to
rely
on
my
past
successes
as
proof
of
rny
being
qualified
to
help
students.
To
start
the
conference,
I
would
discuss
the
introduction
with
the
student,
having
already
assessed
the
level
of
help
I
thought
it
needed.
What
seemed
to
work
best,
in
most
cases,
was
having
the
student
construct
an
outline
during
the
conference.
It
seemed
that
many
students
would
start
w
riting
the
introduction
with
no
real
idea
of
where
they
wanted
it
to
lead.
Once
the
student
had
gained
a
clearer
focus
of
the
goals
of
their
paper
via
an
outline,
we
would
work
on
constructing
an
introduction
that
was
organized
from
general
information
to
specific
and
that
lead
up
to
the
thesis
sentence.
During
this
process,
the
student
would
often
streamline
the
introduction
by
getting
rid
of
sentences
that
were
too
detailed
or
off
topic,
thus
eliminating
the
all
too
common
one-and-a-half
page
long
introductions.
The
conclusion
was
usually
the
next
obstacle
tackled.
Though
this
may
seem
out
of
sequence,
I
found
it
helpful
to
examine
this
paragraph
next
because
writers
seem
to
present
their
personal
remarks
and
opinions
in
the
conclusion,
perhaps
in
an
attempt
to
have
the
reader
remember
what
the
author
felt
was
most
important
about
the
paper.
Therefore,
focusing
the
conclusion
would
often
cause
the
student
to
really
define
what
they
wanted
the
point
of
the
paper
to
be.
As
a
result,
the
student
frequently
decided
to
change
the
tone
of
the
introduction
to
reflect
the
shifted
focus
of
the
paper.
During
this
discussion
about
what
the
writer
most
wanted
to
express,
I
would
refer
to
specific
sentences
or
ideas
in
the
body
10
point
out
inconsistencies
between
the
body
and
conclusion.
Also,
I
would
sometimes
suggest
that
a
particular
idea
be
given
greater
emphasis
in
the
body
since
it
was
such
a
large
part
of
the
conclusion
and
was,
presumably,
important
to
the
writer.
This
in
turn
w'ould
lead
to
deleting
or
altering
parts
of
the
body
as
concepts
were
reevaluated
for
their
contributions
to
the
paper.
Finally,
any
remaining
problems
within
the
body
that
were
not
fixed
by
adjusting
the
introduction
and
conclusion
were
examined
These
generally
amounted
to
condensing
redundant
sentences
and
ideas,
changing
the
order
of
the
body
to
match
the
order
of
ideas
presented
in
the
introduction,
and
clearing
up
incoherent
sentences.
Also,
if
a
claim
were
weakly
supported
In
the
body,
I
would
recommend
further
research
or
that
the
subject
be
removed
from
the
paper
entirely,
with
more
emphasis
be
given
to
the
other
topics.
Anything
else?
After
a
whole
semester
of
working
with
this
FYS
class
that
seemed
to
benefit
from
emphasizing
introductions
and
conclusions,
I
felt
that
I
had
improved
my
own
ability
to
write
these
paragraphs
without
actually
having
written
anything
of
my
own.
This
sentiment
would
not
be
tested
until
spring
semester
when
I
began
work
on
my
paper
for
the
McKelvy
Journal.
The
journal
assignment
gave
students
fre
e
reign
of
topic
selection,
which
reminded
me
of
the
struggles
I
witnessed
the
previous
semest
er.
Before
I
knew
what
was
happening,
I
found
myself
constructing
an
outline
of
my
ideas
prior
to
writing
the
paper,
something
which
I
had
never
before
done
voluntarily.
Oddly
enough,
I
began
to
see
why
outlines
had
always
come
so
highly
recommended
by
my
teachers.
Writing
the
actual
paper
went
much
more
smoothly
than
it
did
in
the
past,
perhaps
since
I
just
used
to
start
writing
blindly,
and
somewhere
around
page
two
I
would
realize
that
my
original
idea
for
the
paper
wasn't
going
to
work.
In
contrast,
the
outline
seemed
to
correct
this
problem
with
a
relatively
small
time
investment
Also,
just
as
I
had
witnessed
in
my
conferences,
an
outline
made
the
introduction
flow
much
more
smoothly,
with
fewer
edits
required.
With
a
fairly
solid
introduction
already
down
on
paper,
I
was
ready
to
start
the
body.
As
I
wrote,
there
seemed
to
be
a
WA
conference
taking
place
inside
my
head.
As
soon
as
I
finished
a
paragraph,
I
would
reread
it
while
"Becky
the
WA"
took
over
and
asked
the
same
questions
and
gave
the
same
advice
as
I
would
during
a
meeting
with
another
student.
Whenever
I
was
tempted
to
move
on
because
I
didn't
feel
like
working
to
improve
a
section,
I
was
assaulted
by
the
"WA
voice"
in
the
back
of
my
head
Though
this
is
now
a
huge
asset
to
my
writing
process,
it
also
has
made
me
aware
of
how
my
comments
might
be
taken
from
the
students'
side.
For
instance,
I
overheard
a
conversation
in
the
lunch
line
once
between
three
freshman
boys.
The
speaker
was
telling
his
two
friends
about
his
FYS
paper
that
was
due
that
day.
"In
the
most
optimal
situation,
I
would
have
taken
my
paper
home
last
night,
made
an
outline,
and
rewritten
most
of
it.
A
more
realistic
plan
would
have
been
to
just
fix
my
introduction.
But,
in
actuality
I
ended
up
just
correcting
all
the
grammar
and
spelling
mistakes
my
WA
had
pointed
out"
(followed
by
carefree
laughter).
As
disheartening
as
such
comments
may
be,
it
helps
put
a
WA's
job
in
perspective.
You
can
lead
a
horse
to
water,
but
you
can't
make
it
drink,
so
to
speak.
I
have
learned
that
it
is
important
not
to
get
discouraged
by
those
who
don't
care
very
much
about
their
writing,
because
the
conferences
where
the
student
stays
for
over
an
hour
due
to
their
own
interest
make
all
the
mediocre
sessions
worthwhile.
In
addition,
even
poor
conferences
serve
as
learning
experiences,
especially
for
the
WA.
A
perfect
example
of
this
can
be
seen
in
the
way
that
being
a
WA
has
helped
ire
improve
my
time
management
skills.
Unfortunately,
I
have
been
victim
to
"night
before"
or
even
"day
of'
conferences,
when
faced
with
no
other
choice
except
no
conference
at
all.
During
these
meetings
I
would
find
myself
about
to
make
a
comment,
but
as
soon
as
I
reminded
myself
that
they
would
only
have
a
few
hours
to
make
changes,
I
would
water
down
my
advice
to
a
less
effective,
but
quicker,
solution.
After
reflecting
on
this,
I
realized
that
the
time
it
ideally
should
take
to
revise
a
paper
after
a
WA
conference
was
much
greater
than
the
time
I
put
into
revising
my
o
wn
papers.
As
this
was
generally
due
to
the
fact
that
I
started
them
only
a
day
or
two
in
advance,
I
have
since
resolved
to
create
a
timeline
for
any
papers
assigned.
Another
benefit
of
making
a
timeline
is
that
it
would
allow7
enough
time
for
me
to
utilize
the
WA
drop
in
service,
which
I
decided
to
start
using
after
witnessing
how
much
even
a
good
writer
can
benefit
from
a
WA
reeding
over
their
paper
ard.
offering
suggestions
from
their
point
of
view.
Nevertheless,
using
this
service
will
be
an
important
step
for
me,
because
I
have
always
been
shy
when
it
came
to
sharing
my
written
work
with
others.
However,
after
spending
a
year
coaxing
equally
timid
students
to
discuss
their
papers,
I
feel
more
comfortable
with
the
idea
of
sharing
my
work
with
a
peer.
In
addition,
I
have
always
been
of
the
opinion
that
I
should
be
ab'e
to
complete
sn
assignment
without
going
to
the
professor
for
assistance.
Now,
though,
I
have
seen
firsthand
how
discussing
the
project
with
the
professor
is
not
a
crutch,
but
rather
a
tool
to
help
generate
ideas
and
possibilities
for
the
paper.
Therefore,
I
plan
on
utilizing
this
resource
as
well
on
future
papers.
Despite
all
the
helpful
tips
I
picked
up
from
my
WA
sessions,
I
still
had
a
challenging,
semester-long
assignment
that
being
a
WA
did
not
especially
prepare
me
for,
and
in
retrospect
I
believe
this
writing
experience
to
be
the
most
formative.
The
assignment
was
given
to
constitute
the
bulk
of
learning
for
my
first
semester
American
Literature
class.
The
class
met
three
times
a
week,
and
at
the
beginning
of
each
class
we
were
required
to
hand
in
a
one-page
essay
on
the
reading
selection
assigned
last
class.
We
were
then
given
a
question
to
write
about
for
the
next
reading.
Often
the
reading
assignment
would
take
two
hours
to
complete,
and
then
I
still
had
to
devise
an
intelligent
response
to
the
question
posed
by
the
professor.
In
the
beginning
of
the
semester,
these
assignments
were
taking
me
about
five
hours
to
complete.
Before
long,
I
realized
it
would
behoove
me
to
complete
the
assignments
more
efficiently,
so
I
began
to
change
the
way
I
had
always
done
assignments
or
this
sort.
Even
though
I
don't
like
to
break
my
train
of
thought
while
reading,
I
forced
myself
to
begin
making
notes
as
I
read,
so
I
wouldn't
forget
all
my
insights
by
the
time
I
sat
down
to
write
the
essay.
I
also
tried
to
write
the
essay
as
soon
as
I
was
done
reading,
while
the
material
was
still
fresh
in
my
mind.
By
the
end
of
the
semester,
I
had
made
some
improvements
in
efficiency,
although
I
still
recognize
this
as
an
area
for
improvement.
I
think
the
problem
is
that
I
am
so
worried
about
being
wrong,
I
can
never
commit
to
an
idea
fully
enough
to
start
spending
time
writing
about
it.
The
best
solution
to
this
would
be
to
silence
my
"inner
critic",
as
we
discussed
at
one
of
our
staff
meetings
this
year.
However,
accomplishing
this
would
be
highly
challenging
and
most
likely
unattainable,
since
I
have
been
battling
with
an
inner
critic
in
many
aspects
of
my
life
ever
since
I
can
remember.
Perhaps
a
more
reasonable
solution
would
be
simply
free-writing
to
see
what
I
put
down
on
paper
in
a
pressure-free
setting,
before
I
compose
my
finished
copy
And
so,
here
I
stand
at
the
beginning
of
a
new
and
promising
academic
year.
The
lessons
I
learned
during
conferences
last
year
will
soon
be
put
to
the
test
as
I
man
drop-in
hours
every
week,
and
I
will
have
ample
opportunity
to
demonstrate
new
skills
and
try
out
new
ideas
and
methods
in
the
two
writing
classes
I
will
be
taking
before
graduation.
As
I
strive
to
achieve
my
personal
best
in
my
writing
assignments,
I
krow
my
WA
work
will
continue
to
be
an
important
part
of
my
life
at
Lafayette
and
will
once
again
be
responsible
for
a
critical
portion
of
my
learning.
