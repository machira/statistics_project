Literacy

A
Brief
History
of
My
Literacy
Writing,
for
most
of
us,
started
out
as
a
systematic
placement
of
several
symbols
on
a
piece
of
lined
paper
that
we
were
told
somehow
spelled
our
name.
From
there,
more
and
more
of
these
symbols
were
placed
together
in
conjunction
with
other
groups
of
symbols
that
we
were
told
formed
sentences.
Over
time,
these
once
meaningless
and
seemingly
contrived
groups
of
strange
symbols
slowly
morphed
into
the
complicated
language
that
we
would
eventually
use
to
compose
more
and
more
sophisticated
and
complex
essays
and
papers.
While
these
statements
may
be
vastly
over-generalized
and
not
entirely
applicable
to
every
individual
person,
they
broadly
describe
the
writing
experiences
of
most
human
beings
as
they
intellectually
age
and
mature.
However,
on
a
more
specific
level
almost
everyone
can
probably
trace
his
or
her
own
writing
history
D
from
the
time
when
he
or
she
first
started
forming
letters
in
kindergarten
or
pre-school,
to
the
time
when
he
or
she
was
capable
of
producing
lengthy,
well-organized,
refined
pieces
of
writing.
Teachers
told
me
I
had
a
knack
for
writing
at
a
very
young
age.
I
was
applauded
by
teachers
in
pre-school
and
kindergarten
for
being
able
to
write
my
name
very
neatly
D
just
about
the
only
way
a
student
writer
could
stand
out
from
the
crowd
at
such
an
immature
stage
of
writing
development.
My
first
real
memory
regarding
actual
writing
came
in
second
grade
when
I
composed
a
short
poem
for
class
and
it
was
selected
by
the
teacher
for
submission
to
an
elementary
poetry
contest.
The
poem,
the
title
and
content
of
which
escape
me
at
the
present
time,
was
chosen
for
submission
to
the
final
round
of
the
contest
where
it
unfortunately
failed
to
claim
a
prize.
Despite
the
praise
and
positive
feedback
I
received
from
my
parents
and
teachers
regarding
my
poem,
I
never
really
engaged
in
any
creative
writing
pursuits
on
my
own
or
as
a
result
of
school
assignments
after
this
first
experience,
at
least
for
awhile.
Thinking
back
on
this
memory,
I
feel
as
if
the
open-endedness
and
vagueness
of
poetic
construction
probably
frightened
and
overwhelmed
me
at
such
a
young
age.
It
was
not
until
fourth
grade
that
I
was
assigned
my
first
Nresearch
paper.O
It
was
a
relatively
short
handwritten
paper
on
the
Shoshone
Indians,
and
was
my
first
exposure
to
the
guidelines
and
predisposed
structure
that
goes
along
with
formal
research
paper
writing.
I
remember
finding
it
very
difficult
to
paraphrase
ideas
and
paragraphs
from
the
books
I
was
using
as
sources
for
the
paper,
and
thus
found
myself
placing
citations
after
almost
every
sentence
as
a
result
of
my
frustration
and
misunderstanding
of
all
these
newfound
concepts.
This
experience
most
definitely
caused
me
to
mature
as
a
writer.
While
it
may
seem
like
an
extremely
juvenile
research
assignment
in
comparison
with
the
types
of
papers
I
have
been
assigned
in
college
courses,
it
gave
me
a
good
idea
of
what
formal
writing
was
and
exactly
what
lay
ahead
in
my
writing
education.
In
addition,
despite
my
initial
discomfort
with
the
ideas
of
research
and
documentation,
the
somewhat
structured
aspect
of
the
research
paper
made
me
more
comfortable
writing
within
the
borders
of
that
particular
style
of
writing
D
I
felt
as
if
there
were
some
rules
and
boundaries
to
guide
me
along
as
I
wrote.
Eighth
grade
brought
two
new
dimensions
to
my
writing
education
D
firstly,
I
was
taught
how
to
write
lab
reports
for
my
Advanced
Physical
Science
course,
a
task
which
posed
many
difficulties
for
me
at
first
but
proved
useful
in
high
school
when
I
was
enrolled
in
Advanced
Placement
Biology,
and
secondly,
I
was
placed
in
English
classes
that
would
prepare
me
for
the
GEPA
standardized
test.
The
physical
science
class
manifested
in
me
a
growing
dislike
for
the
overly
structured
format
of
the
lab
report.
The
mathematical
aspect
of
the
lab
reports
for
this
class,
including
making
calculations
and
creating
graphs
and
tables
with
the
results,
caused
me
to
receive
lower
grades
than
I
was
used
to
getting
on
school
assignments
and
turned
me
away
from
scientific
and
mathematical
writing.
It
was
then
that
I
realized
that
writing
in
English
or
Social
Studies
classes
interested
me
much
more
than
writing
in
Science
or
Math
classes
D
not
only
did
I
find
the
topics
in
English
and
History
more
interesting,
I
found
that
I
was
able
to
express
myself
better
when
writing
about
topics
within
those
disciplines.
My
eighth
grade
English
class
experience
is
perhaps
the
part
of
my
formal
education
that
angers
me
the
most.
Almost
the
entire
focus
of
the
course
centered
upon
the
GEPA
standardized
test
that
all
students
were
required
to
take
at
the
end
of
the
year
for
high
school
course
placement.
It
was
at
this
point
in
my
writing
education
that
I
was
introduced
to
the
idea
of
figurative
language.
I
was
taught
to
write
essays
of
five
paragraphs
in
length
(an
introduction,
three
body
paragraphs,
and
a
conclusion)
and
instructed
to
include
as
many
types
of
figurative
language
as
many
times
as
possible
in
these
essays.
I
remember
all
of
this
as
if
I
had
been
taught
it
yesterday
D
it
is
so
ingrained
in
my
head
from
endless
repetition
and
essay
writing
that
I
think
it
will
probably
haunt
me
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
This
period
in
my
writing
history
was
probably
the
least
fulfilling
for
me
in
the
end,
because
while
I
received
high
grades
on
what
I
wrote,
I
felt
as
if
I
was
being
forced
to
write
a
certain
way
and
received
little
satisfaction
from
my
final
products.
I
followed
what
I
had
been
taught
and
passed
the
writing
part
of
the
GEPA
test
in
the
highest
of
the
three
possible
brackets,
but
I
also
brought
this
style
of
essay
writing
along
with
me
to
high
school,
for
it
was
the
only
style
I
really
knew,
and
that
was
where
one
of
the
bigger
steps
in
the
advancement
and
maturation
of
my
writing
took
place.
I
cannot
remember
the
topic
of
my
first
paper
for
ninth
grade
Honors
English
class,
but
I
can
remember
the
teacherOs
reaction
when
he
read
the
20
five-paragraph
essays
littered
with
inane
amounts
of
entirely
unnecessary
and
utterly
inappropriate
figurative
language.
He
was
absolutely
dumbfounded
by
the
entire
thing,
and
told
everyone
in
the
class
that
for
every
piece
of
figurative
language
he
found
in
an
essay
from
that
point
on,
five
points
would
be
deducted
from
the
essayOs
total
score.
It
was
at
this
point
in
time
that
I
was
forced
to
almost
entirely
revamp
my
writing
strategy
D
figurative
language
had
to
go
out
the
window,
and
I
slowly
found
out
that
the
five
paragraph
essay
I
had
grown
so
accustomed
to
was
not
always
the
best
choice
for
every
single
writing
assignment.
This
was
an
uncomfortable
transitional
period
for
me
in
regards
to
my
writing,
and
I
was
certainly
not
the
only
person
whose
writing
was
forced
to
undergo
such
a
transition,
for
all
of
my
classmates
were
faced
with
a
similar
situation.
My
ninth
grade
English
teacher
was
thankfully
able
to
wean
me
off
the
figurative
language
bottle
and
point
both
me
and
my
writing
in
the
proper
direction,
at
least
for
the
time
being.
In
tenth
grade
I
was
able
to
test
out
my
newfound
writing
strategies
and
abilities
through
writing
a
lengthy
research
paper
about
the
idea
of
the
abuse
of
political
and
military
power,
and
also
through
preparing
a
debate
(along
with
several
written
supplements)
against
the
use
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
United
States.
The
positive
feedback
I
received
from
teachers,
peers
and
my
parents
regarding
these
writing
assignments
and
others
from
the
same
class
served
to
greatly
boost
my
personal
confidence
in
my
writing.
I
was
proud
of
the
work
I
was
able
to
produce,
and
my
success
in
English
and
writing
caused
me
to
take
a
greater
interest
in
it
and
I
began
to
realize
that
it
was
probably
my
strongest
subject
area.
It
was
during
this
period
in
my
writing
history
that
I
realized
my
interest
in
not
only
reading
literature,
but
also
in
writing
about
it.
Eleventh
grade
brought
with
it
many
new
writing
challenges,
but
also
many
rewards
as
well.
Advanced
Placement
Biology
and
English
III
Honors
each
exposed
me
to
a
new
type
of
writing.
Biology
required
massive
in-depth
lab
reports
to
be
submitted
at
the
conclusion
of
each
laboratory
experiment,
and
English
required
an
end
of
the
year
research
paper
on
a
novel
of
my
choice
(so
long
as
the
author
was
of
British
descent).
The
lab
reports
reminded
me
somewhat
of
the
ones
I
had
been
faced
with
back
in
my
eighth
grade
physical
science
course,
except
the
biology
labs
lacked
(for
the
most
part)
the
extensive
mathematical
calculations
that
had
dominated
the
physical
science
class
lab
reports.
I
found
myself
to
be
a
fairly
decent
biology
student,
and
always
did
well
on
the
sections
of
the
lab
reports
such
as
the
introduction
and
conclusion,
the
sections
which
were
most
dependent
on
my
ability
to
express
myself
and
convey
observations
and
ideas
clearly.
However,
I
found
writing
about
science
to
be
less
exhilarating
and
refreshing
than
writing
about
literature
or
history,
and
I
had
the
opportunity
to
compose
a
formal
research
paper
on
the
idea
of
sexuality
in
Bram
StokerOs
Dracula
for
my
English
class
that
same
year.
This
was
the
first
time
I
had
ever
written
a
research
paper
on
a
piece
of
literature,
and
it
was
at
this
point
in
time
that
I
was
introduced
to
the
idea
of
literary
criticism
and
how
to
use
the
ideas
of
literary
critics
to
back
up
my
own
thesis
about
an
aspect
of
a
work
of
literature.
The
process
of
researching,
note
taking
and
writing
this
research
paper
prepared
me
well
for
the
types
of
papers
I
was
faced
with
during
my
first
semester
at
Lafayette
College
in
English
205.
I
remember
being
extremely
proud
of
the
amount
of
work
and
research
I
put
into
the
paper;
it
felt
good
to
be
able
to
make
a
statement,
back
it
up
with
support
from
renowned
critical
authorities
on
the
subject,
and
ultimately
prove
a
somewhat
unique
point
regarding
the
content
of
a
famous
novel.
This
English
course
solidified
my
specific
interests
in
literature
and
writing
about
literature,
and
further
caused
me
to
believe
that
English
might
be
my
main
choice
of
academic
pursuit
in
college.
The
only
real
writing
I
was
required
to
do
during
my
senior
year
of
high
school
was
for
Advanced
Placement
English.
The
focus
of
this
course
was
to
prepare
me
to
be
able
to
successfully
pass
the
Advanced
Placement
English
Literature
exam,
and
thus
the
types
of
writing
I
was
assigned
reflected
what
would
appear
on
this
exam.
There
were
no
out
of
class
writing
assignments
for
this
class;
all
of
the
papers
were
written
as
in-class
essays
and
due
to
the
time
constraint
of
45
minutes
were
usually
four
to
five
paragraphs
and
followed
a
somewhat
tight
structural
pattern
similar
to
the
one
from
the
eighth
grade
GEPA
preparation
class.
The
content
of
the
class
itself,
specifically
the
wealth
of
brilliant
novels
and
poems
I
read,
greatly
enthralled
me
D
many
of
my
favorite
novels
to
date
are
ones
I
read
in
that
class.
However,
the
type
of
writing
I
became
accustomed
to
while
taking
that
class
ill
prepared
me
for
anything
besides
the
Advanced
Placement
exam.
While
I
may
have
done
well
on
the
exam
thanks
to
endless
in-class
essay
assignments
lacking
any
research
and
coming
from
the
top
of
my
head,
I
was
simply
not
ready
for
the
types
of
papers
I
would
be
assigned
in
college
courses.
I
had
thought
that
Advanced
Placement
English
would
prepare
me
for
writing
on
the
college
level,
but
although
in
most
ways
it
failed
to
accomplish
that
goal
and
caused
some
rude-awakenings
during
my
first
semester
at
Lafayette,
I
feel
most
definitely
that
my
most
rewarding
experiences
regarding
English,
literature,
and
writing
have
been
a
result
of
college
course
assignments.
English
205
taught
me
how
to
write
about
literature
from
numerous
critical
angles,
something
I
had
never
had
to
do
before
in
my
life.
One
of
the
hardest
things
for
me
to
accept
was
the
fact
that
sometimes
I
was
allowed
to
use
the
first
person
when
discussing
literature
in
a
formal
paper
(such
as
when
employing
reader-response
criticism
tactics).
It
did
not
take
me
long
to
realize
hat
I
had
a
lot
to
learn
about
writing
when
I
arrived
at
Lafayette,
so
instead
of
fighting
the
new
ideas
I
was
being
faced
with
and
making
things
more
difficult
for
myself,
I
decided
to
start
college
with
a
clean
slate
in
regards
to
writing
and
how
it
should
be
done
properly.
It
was
uncomfortable
at
times
-
being
forced
to
write
in
ways
I
had
never
written
before
-
but
in
hindsight
I
feel
as
if
bearing
this
discomfort
has
overwhelmingly
furthered
my
writing
ability
and
capacity
beyond
anything
I
could
have
previously
imagined.
It
is
amazing
to
look
back
and
see
how
far
I
have
come
as
a
writer
from
those
first
days
back
in
kindergarten
writing
my
name
and
simple
sentences
to
today
where
I
am
consistently
pumping
out
research
papers
and
various
other
highly
sophisticated
types
of
writing.
At
this
point,
I
can
barely
imagine
where
the
next
three
years
of
college
and
beyond
will
take
my
writing
abilities.
