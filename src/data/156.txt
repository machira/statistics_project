A
Literacy
Narrative
August
28,
1998
I
guess
the
best
way
to
start
a
narrative
about
my
writing
history
is
with
one
of
my
most
familiar
experiences
whenever
I
am
given
a
writing
assignment--writer's
block.
I
have
learned
recently
that
even
the
most
famous
and
talented
writers
deal
with
this
frustrating
phenomenon,
so
I
don't
feel
so
badly
about
it.
I
try
to
embrace
the
annoying
brain
freeze
that
I
experience
whenever
I
am
asked
to
go
back
into
my
childhood
memory
bank.
At
first,
I
think
I
had
no
childhood,
since
I
cannot
remember
a
thing,
but
if
I
just
start
writing
and
allow
my
thoughts
to
pour
out,
I
end
up
discovering
a
vast
history.
Before
this
occurs,
though,
I
deal
with
all
the
negativities
of
writing-every
word
I
write
sounds
awful
to
me,
I
curse
the
assignment,
and
I
question
my
talent
as
a
writer
(and
as
a
thinker).
Without
a
doubt,
writer's
block
is
no
fun,
but,
for
me,
as
for
many,
it
is
part
of
the
wondrous
process
of
writing.
So
what
is
my
earliest
memory
of
writing?
I
am
sure
I
wrote
sentences
in
kindergarten
like
"My
name
is
Ali,"
and
in
first
grade
I
probably
moved
on
to
paragraphs,
but
nothing
stands
out
from
those
years.
My
first
recollection
of
really
being
a
"writer"
is
from
the
summer
after
second
grade.
It
was
1985
and
I
was
eight
years
old.
I
went
away
to
sleepaway
camp
for
the
first
time.
Needless
to
say,
I
became
very
familiar
with
homesickness.
I
could
only
talk
to
my
parents
every
few
weeks,
because
whenever
I
talked
to
them
I
would
cry
hysterically
for
what
seemed
like
hours
at
the
time.
Therefore,
my
sole
form
of
communication
with
my
parents
was
letter
writing
(this
was
pre-email
days).
I
wrote
to
them
often,
telling
them
about
all
the
activities
I
participated
in,
all
the
friends
I
made,
and
how
much
I
missed
them.
Since
then,
letter
writing
has
been
an
important
means
of
communication
with
people
I
care
about.
Now,
with
the
convenience
of
email,
I
am
constantly
writing
back
and
forth
with
tons
of
people.
My
third
grade
teacher
emphasized
writing
in
her
general
curriculum.
This
was
the
year
we
learned
how
to
write
in
cursive,
so
we
practiced
the
actual
act
of
writing
exhaustively.
We
also
kept
weekly
journals
for
the
first
time
in
school.
My
teacher
read
and
responded
to
our
entries
each
week.
My
journal
became
a
place
where
I
could
have
a
personal
dialogue
with
her.
I
shared
myself
with
her
on
paper,
as
she
did
with
me
in
her
responses.
Through
writing
we
got
to
know
each
other
personally,
since
I
felt
comfortable
exposing
myself
on
paper.
School
journal
writing
is
unique
because
it
involves
an
audience.
Whether
I
was
aware
of
it
or
not,
I
most
likely
censored
my
words
because
I
knew
my
teacher
was
going
to
read
them.
On
the
other
hand,
I
also
kept
a
personal
journal
starting
around
that
age.
11
was
a
pink
Cabbage
Patch
Kids
diary
with
a
lock
and
key
where
I
was
able
to
keep
all
my
secrets.
Non-
audience
writing
is
the
most
precious
to
me,
because
it
is
honest,
flowing,
true
expression.
At
least
in
theory,
that
is.
I
have
kept
journals
off
and
on
since
my
Cabbage
Patch
days,
and
like
to
think
of
writing
in
them
as
a
way
of
recording
my
life.
In
ten
years
from
now,
when
I
am
feeling
nostalgic,
I
want
to
know
what
I
was
feeling
as
I
was
growing
up.
I
don't
want
vague
memories
of
my
life;
I
want
to
hold
on
to
my
experiences.
I
also
value
my
journal
as
a
place
where
I
can
explore
my
thoughts.
Oftentimes
I
feel
more
comfortable
writing
than
speaking,
and
when
I
have
private
thoughts
that
I
want
to
formulate,
my
journal
is
always
there
for
me.
I
realized
one
night
when
I
was
writing
in
my
journal
that
I
often
hold
back.
Even
though
I
am
not
writing
for
an
audience,
I
often
write
as
if
I
am.
I
censor
my
thoughts
based
on
some
imaginary
audience,
who
may
or
may
not
ever
read
it.
This
disturbs
me
greatly
because
I
liked
thinking
of
my
journal
as
my
safe
place
to
freely
express
myself,
but
even
there
I
am
restricted.
I
remember
when
I
was
in
elementary
school
I
caught
my
mother
reading
my
diary
and
found
out
she
had
been
opening
and
indulging
in
my
mail
as
well.
I
was
outraged!
I
think
this
invasion
of
privacy
left
its
mark
on
me,
and
perhaps
that
is
why
I
cannot
completely
and
honestly
express
myself.
I
also
think
that
because
our
education
system
emphasizes
academic
writing,
we
are
taught
to
always
consider
the
audience.
While
I
wouldn't
dispute
the
significance
of
being
aware
of
your
reader,
constantly
focusing
on
what
others
will
think
of
what
you
write
is
very
inhibiting.
Writing
is
a
paradox--on
the
one
hand
it
can
be
one
of
the
most
personal
forms
of
expression,
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
must
be
censored
and
trimmed
so
that
it
is
appropriate
for
the
audience.
Oftentimes
this
"censorship"
is
subtle
and
we
don't
even
realize
we
are
constricting
ourselves.
One
vivid
memory
of
accommodating
my
audience
in
my
writing
occurred
in
my
senior
year
of
high
school.
In
Advanced
Composition
class,
my
assignment
was
to
describe
a
family
activity
that
I
valued.
I
wrote
about
the
Sunday
morning
breakfast
tradition
that
we
used
to
have.
In
my
description
I
shared
that
I
woke
up
at
eleven
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
then
went
down
to
the
kitchen
to
the
fresh
scent
of
warm
bagels.
My
teacher
put
a
red
question
mark
over
"eleven
o'clock,"
and
when
I
stayed
after
class
and
asked
him
what
he
meant
by
that,
he
told
me
he
was
shocked
that
I
awoke
so
late
in
the
day.
For
my
second
draft,
I
changed
the
time
to
ten
o'clock,
to
fit
his
expectations.
I
never
woke
up
before
eleven
on
the
weekends
in
high
school,
but
in
order
to
please
my
teacher,
I
altered
my
story.
This
time
he
still
was
shocked,
and
wrote
something
referring
to
the
lateness.
For
my
final
draft,
I
woke
up
an
hour
and
a
half
earlier,
at
9:30
am.
Anyone
who
read
that
narrative
of
my
family
tradition
received
a
false
account.
Here
I
was,
attempting
to
share
myself
with
an
audience,
yet
allowing
my
teacher,
my
critic,
to
alter
my
reality.
Why
did
I
change
it?
Why
didn't
I
have
the
courage
to
be
a
late
sleeper
regardless
of
what
this
teacher
thought?
Clearly,
I
cared
a
lot
(too
much)
about
what
he
thought,
as
I
have
always
considered
my
teacher's
opinions
of
me
to
be
important.
I
wanted
to
please
my
audience,
so
I
sacrificed
my
truth
for
the
reader.
Even
though
it
was
only
the
time
I
woke
up,
it
was
my
truth,
my
reality,
my
history.
Luckily,
I
have
not
had
many
teachers
who
so
blatantly
wanted
their
students
to
write
to
please
them,
but
almost
all
teachers
have
a
style
and
want
their
students
to
adopt
it.
I
could
write
a
paper
for
one
teacher
and
be
praised,
or
give
the
same
paper
to
another
teacher
and
have
it
tom
apart.
Instead
of
learning
to
develop
our
own
writing
styles,
we're
often
encouraged
to
alter
ourselves
to
fit
the
teacher's
mold
of
writing.
Good
teachers,
I
believe,
encourage
students
to
find
their
own
styles.
They
share
their
knowledge
to
advise
rather
than
mold
the
students
in
their
image.
I
have
been
fortunate
to
have
had
several
such
teachers
and
professors.
Writing
has
always
been
something
very
personal
to
me.
It
is
my
voice.
I
write
what
I
want
to
speak
but
don't
have
the
courage
to
say.
It
is
my
most
comfortable
form
of
expression.
I
can
take
my
time,
think
things
through,
cross
words
out,
move
them
around,
all
without
an
audience
watching
me,
judging
me.
Writing
is
comfort
for
me.
When
I
speak
I
don't
like
to
make
mistakes.
I
hold
back
from
voicing
a
thought
unless
I
am
quite
certain
it
is
"right."
When
I
write
I
like
to
just
let
my
thoughts
flow
freely,
to
say
whatever
is
on
my
mind,
and
go
back
to
fix
it
later.
However,
I
cannot
always
ignore
that
little
critic
in
my
head
that
sometimes
holds
me
back.
I
have
learned,
though,
from
many
bouts
with
writer's
block,
that
the
best
way
to
write
a
paper,
or
anything,
is
to
just
begin
writing.
I
admire
the
Dada
and
Surrealist
writers
for
this
flowing
technique--
ignore
your
inner
critic,
ignore
your
audience,
and
just
use
the
pen
to
transport
your
thoughts
into
the
world.
It
is
my
goal
to
be
able
to
share
myself
without
sacrificing
myself,
to
be
personal
while
pleasing
my
audience,
and
to
be
aware
of
the
reader
without
writing/or
the
reader.
It
sure
is
easier
said
than
done,
but
it
is
a
challenge
I
enjoy.
