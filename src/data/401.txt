My
Literary
Narrative
IOve
never
known
a
good
writer
who
was
not
first
and
foremost
a
good
reader.
Writing,
whether
personal
or
academic,
cannot
be
successful
unless
one
first
knows
how
to
write
by
drawing
a
style
from
their
favorite
sources,
be
it
fiction
or
non-fiction.
Perhaps
this
is
why
I
canOt
remember
writing
anything
prior
to
7th
grade
in
high
school,
whereas
I
can
distinctly
remember
reading
a
great
many
books,
even
back
so
far
as
early
elementary
school.
With
this
in
mind,
I
believe
the
best
way
to
see
how
my
literary
style
developed
is
to
first
understand
how
othersO
literary
narratives
have
affected
me,
and
left
their
imprints
on
my
style,
my
tastes,
and
my
talents,
down
to
the
present
day.
My
favorite
authors
as
a
young
person
were
R.L.
Stine,
author
of
the
hugely
popular
NGoosebumpsO
series,
and
Michael
Crichton,
whose
works
include
Jurassic
Park,
Sphere
and
Congo.
Although
most
would
assume
these
to
be
two
very
different
literary
figures,
their
writing
styles
hold
many
similarities
which
make
them
perfect
for
pre-teens
looking
to
find
an
author
who
knows
how
to
write
for
people
of
their
age.
Both
lay
out
plots
which
are
very
easy
to
follow,
usually
based
on
the
quest
motif,
in
which
a
character
is
searching
for
some
answer
or
goal
and
solves
various
puzzles
along
the
way.
The
difficulty
of
finding
the
answers
along
the
way
holds
the
readerOs
interest,
while
if
one
were
to
Oread
the
book
backwards,O
they
would
see
that
the
steps
were
logical
and
in
most
cases
the
only
options
available.
In
addition,
these
two
authors
are
similar
because
they
both
feature
very
flat
characters.
The
OheroO
is
easy
to
understand
and
a
young
reader
can
transplant
themselves
into
that
role,
due
to
the
lack
of
complicating
character
development.
Also,
the
supporting
casts
are
very
simple
for
the
young
reader
to
understand.
R.L.
StineOs
cast,
aside
from
the
hero,
is
usually
that
of
the
pre-pubescent
female
friend;
the
brainy
kid
who
leads
the
hero
until
the
very
end,
when
the
hero
saves
the
day;
and
the
timid
friend
or
younger
sibling
who
is
also
along
for
the
ride.
In
Michael
CrichtonOs
works,
the
hero
is
usually
a
scientist,
noted
for
their
expertise
but
also
brave,
thereby
taking
in
the
hero
role.
In
addition
to
the
hero
there
are
various
minor
supporting
characters
which
take
on
only
one
role
and
have
no
personality,
such
as
another
scientist,
a
soldier,
a
chronic
victim
or
several
others.
What
both
these
writers
in
effect
create,
is
a
world
where
the
reader
can
put
themselves
directly
into
the
action
and
understand
it;
Stine,
relating
the
material
to
children,
while
Crichton
relates
to
adults,
or
to
children
who
see
themselves
in
the
role
of
the
adults.
These
styles
are
easy
to
mimic,
due
to
the
lack
of
complicated
emotional
expression
on
paper,
and
the
epic
quality
which
appears,
over
all
other
styles,
to
be
ingrained
into
historical
writing
samples.
As
a
result,
it
is
no
wonder
that
my
first
writing
style
would
develop
based
largely
from
these
two
sources,
as
they
are
perfectly
simplistic
forms
of
expression
for
a
10-12
year
old.
This
writing
style
I
speak
of
was
largely
used
solely
for
academic
writing,
as
at
this
stage
in
my
life
I
held
a
certain
reverence
for
consuming,
rather
than
producing
literature,
and
would
only
write
when
I
was
forced
to
for
school.
My
papers
for
school
(generally
book
reports)
all
received
high
grades,
due
to
the
fact
that
my
style
of
writing
emphasized
fact,
relating
information
in
a
chronological
order
after
completely
digesting
the
material
in
question
and
ObacktrackingO
throughout
the
book
in
question
before
writing
it
down.
Due
to
the
hero-centric
focus
of
my
early
favorite
authors
it
was
easy
to
put
myself
in
the
center
of
the
novel,
and
due
to
the
nature
of
these
books
that
dealt
with
understanding
concepts
only
after
reading,
rather
than
during,
it
was
easy
to
re-hash
the
information
I
read.
This
style
served
me
poorly,
however,
for
trying
to
understand
advanced
concepts
such
as
small
packets
with
no
engulfing
plot,
like
nonfiction
papers;
large
novels
with
many
intertwining
themes;
and
books
that
dealt
closely
with
a
characterOs
mental
state,
which,
if
different
from
mine,
I
had
no
ability
to
comprehend.
Luckily,
just
as
I
was
turning
16,
the
time
I
would
need
to
understand
these
concepts,
as
I
was
entering
11th
grade
and
my
first
class
in
advanced
English,
I
discovered
a
writing
style
which
managed
to
explain
these
styles
to
me
in
terms
I
was
very
capable
of
understanding.
This
style,
which
IOve
been
told
that
IOm
well
equipped
to
write
with,
is
satire.
There
are
many
authors
whose
works
in
this
format
I
really
enjoy,
but
the
one
who
taught
me
the
most
about
the
format
was
a
British
author
named
Terry
Pratchett,
who,
while
not
being
very
well
known,
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
foremost
modern
satirists.
Nearly
all
his
books
occur
in
an
imaginary
universe
called
NDiscworld,O
where
Earth
is
shaped
like
a
disc
and
nearly
all
its
inhabitants
have
a
similarly
skewed
way
of
life.
In
addition,
I
starting
reading
works
by
Joseph
Heller
and
Kurt
Vonnegut.
Satire
of
this
sort
teaches
many
skills
essential
to
an
understanding
of
more
advanced
forms
of
writing.
Through
intricate
explanation
in
first
person
perspective
books
I
was
able
to
gain
an
understanding
of
mental
states
of
characters,
as
well
as
the
ability
to
look
for
motivations
that
may
not
be
evident
in
the
writing
itself.
This
left
me
adequately
prepared
for
the
biggest
writing
challenge
of
my
life
up
to
that
point,
12th
grade
AP
English.
I
must
admit,
I
came
into
the
class
expecting
not
to
have
to
do
much
work,
assuming
I
could
just
continue
as
I
had,
turning
in
papers
I
wrote
the
night
before
and
receiving
AOs
on
them.
I
was
dumbfounded
when
the
first
paper
I
received
back
after
starting
the
class
was
a
D+.
My
teacher
in
the
class,
whom
IOd
had
for
the
previous
yearOs
11th
grade
Advanced
English
class
wrote
that
heOd
expected
better
of
me.
After
class
I
told
him
that
I
expected
better
of
myself
and
promised
that
IOd
do
better
next
time.
This
D+,
perhaps
more
than
any
other
thing
that
IOd
ever
learned
in
school,
made
me
both
a
far
better
reader
and
writer.
IOd
always
read
through
a
book
once,
getting
a
cursory
knowledge
of
the
information,
and
used
the
fact
that
I
had
a
large
vocabulary
to
Obuff
upO
my
papers
to
make
them
sound
more
intelligent
and
deserving
of
a
good
grade.
However,
now
I
realized
that
I
couldnOt
produce
gold
from
iron,
I
had
to
work
hard
to
achieve
my
results.
The
next
paper
in
AP
English
I
received
a
B+,
and
I
never
got
below
an
A-
after
that.
But
I
learned
far
more
about
writing
in
that
class
than
that
I
needed
to
try
in
order
to
succeed.
I
learned
a
great
deal
about
understanding
the
significance
of
symbols
and
events
in
the
role
of
creating
a
characterOs
mental
state,
as
well
as
an
understanding
of
such
advanced
writing
techniques
as
stream
of
consciousness.
Perhaps
the
one
book
that
taught
me
more
than
any
other
about
how
to
read
to
understand
was
FaulknerOs
The
Sound
and
the
Fury.
I
cannot
imagine
a
book
being
any
more
difficult
to
understand,
especially
BenjyOs
section,
or
being
filled
with
any
more
internal
references
to
self
and
others,
like
QuentinOs
section.
This
book
thoroughly
confused
me,
I
had
to
read
it
three
times
completely
(not
to
mention
numerous
references
to
certain
sections),
and
it
took
me
nearly
6000
words
to
provide
even
a
cursory
analysis
of
the
book.
However,
despite
the
fact
that
this
was
merely
one
of
a
half
dozen
book
reports
I
did
in
AP
English,
this
is
the
one
IOm
most
proud
of.
Not
because
I
was
the
first
student
in
my
teacherOs
26
year
career
to
receive
an
A
for
their
paper
on
this
book,
but
simply
because
of
the
fact
that,
re-reading
my
writings
after
a
year
in
college,
everything
else
IOve
ever
written
seems
pedestrian
compared
to
this.
But
all
IOve
talked
about
up
to
this
point
is
how
AP
English
taught
me
to
read,
it
also
was
the
first
class
that
truly
taught
me
how
to
write.
As
IOve
stated
before,
up
until
this
point
I
had
tried
to
artificially
inflate
my
papers
by
using
language
that
no
normal
human
would
ever
speak
in,
in
order
to
make
my
writing
appear
more
important
because
I
used
special
words.
Well,
that
was
all
over
as
soon
as
my
D+
came
back
to
me.
I
had
two
comments
on
there
that
made
me
realize
I
could
no
longer
wow
teachers
with
big
words:
Nmore
letters
donOt
make
an
adjective
more
fundamentally
true,O
and
Nhaving
a
big
vocabulary
doesnOt
make
you
intelligent,
knowing
when
to
use
it
does.O
After
this
I
realized
that
I
didnOt
need
to
inject
artificially
inflated
words
into
my
writing
to
make
it
sound
smart,
and
I
didnOt
need
to
explain
something
for
a
paragraph
when
a
sentence
would
do.
Against
all
my
prior
expectations,
this
didnOt
make
my
writing
any
worse,
in
fact,
it
became
better.
When
I
stripped
all
the
big
words
and
lengthy
explanations
away
from
my
first
post
D+
paper,
I
realized
just
how
horrible
and
uninformative
my
writing
had
truly
been.
This
left
me
with
a
hole
to
fill,
which
luckily,
thanks
to
my
continual
love
of
reading
and
newly
acquired
desire
to
read
to
understand,
I
was
able
to.
This
brings
me
up
to
the
present
day,
which,
thanks
to
either
my
inability
to
objectively
evaluate
my
current
self,
or
just
a
hopefully
false
assumption
that
I
havenOt
progressed
since
my
final
year
of
high
school,
I
am
absolutely
stumped
as
to
how
to
analyze
my
current
writing
style.
As
far
as
reading
style
goes,
IOm
afraid
that
I
havenOt
progressed
at
all.
Certainly
I
read
a
far
broader
range
of
materials
now
than
I
ever
used
to
in
high
school
(I
read
modern
philosophy
papers
for
fun),
and
at
the
same
time
I
read
a
much
more
selective
series
of
books
than
I
ever
used
to
(unless
youOre
an
English
major,
college
kills
fiction).
But
as
far
as
how
I
read
a
book,
rather
than
what
that
book
is,
IOve
progressed
very
little
from
AP
English.
Though
that
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing.
Doing
multiple
close
readings,
selective
chapter
readings
and
finally
brief
run-through
refreshers
certainly
canOt
be
faulty,
and
I
canOt
imagine
how
else
to
be
more
thorough,
so
dare
I
say
that
IOve
reached
the
pinnacle
of
knowing
how
to
read
a
book?
But
as
to
the
subject
of
writing,
IOve
not
only
become
a
much
more
thorough
and
concise
writer
than
even
when
I
was
in
high
school,
IOve
also
developed
the
ability
to
make
my
writing
both
informative
and
informal,
two
skills
which
in
high
school
I
thought
were
mutually
exclusive.
I
owe
the
first
new
ability
to
my
Government
104
class,
Intro
to
Political
Theory.
Due
to
a
3-4
page
limit,
our
topics
had
to
be
pretty
small,
especially
for
papers,
each
of
which
accounted
for
1/3
of
our
final
grade,
and
which
covered
works
of
monumental
complexity
and
depth.
It
was
a
great
challenge
to
strike
a
chord
between
giving
enough
information
and
keeping
it
within
a
miniscule
four
page
limit.
My
first
two
papers
I
received
B-Os
on
each,
the
first
because
I
didnOt
say
enough,
and
the
second
because
I
got
off
topic
and
said
too
much,
not
explaining
any
of
it
thoroughly
enough.
But
by
the
third
paper
I
knew
how
to
put
my
thoughts
in
a
clear,
concise
format,
without
being
too
wordy
in
the
process.
The
second
great
skill
I
learned
came
from
my
FYS
D
Political
Humor.
After
taking
my
first
paper
to
my
WA
he
said
that
my
writing
was
very
stiff
and
not
much
fun
to
read.
I
never
really
thought
about
making
papers
readable
before
that
point,
I
was
more
concentrated
on
the
writing
than
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
written.
In
my
second
draft
I
concentrated
on
trying
to
make
it
more
breezy
and
readable,
injecting
some
humor
into
my
topic,
and
apparently
it
worked.
My
professor
commented
upon
returning
the
paper
how
enjoyable
it
was
to
read.
From
that
point
on
IOve
made
sure
to
inject
a
little
humor
into
all
my
papers
when
I
can
think
of
something
to
break
the
monotony
of
reading
studentsO
papers.
Aside
from
that
IOm
afraid
this
is
the
extent
of
my
writing
style.
As
you
can
see
IOve
been
developing
at
a
fairly
constant
rate
ever
since
reaching
11th
grade,
and
presumably
I
will
continue
to
grow
in
knowledge
of
how
to
write
better
as
I
continue
through
college.
Despite
the
fact
that
this
deals
solely
with
academic
writing,
I
do
attempt
some
poetry
when
IOve
got
absolutely
nothing
better
to
do,
and
this
lack
of
deep
interest
is
reflected
in
the
quality
of
the
poems.
However,
IOve
been
developing
at
a
fairly
rapid
(I
think)
pace
and
assume
that
at
some
point
IOll
learn
some
little
insight
that
will
allow
me
to
excel
in
poetry
as
I
(hopefully)
do
in
prose.
And
now,
who
knows,
just
as
I
was
helped
in
becoming
a
better
writer
by
one
of
my
WAOs,
perhaps
now
that
I
have
this
opportunity
I
can
help
a
student
become
a
better
writer
(as
long
as
they
donOt
make
me
try
to
understand
their
poetry).
