My
history
as
a
writer,
as
far
as
I
can
remember,
began
in
the
third
grade
with
a
creative
writing
assignment.
Throughout
middle
school
and
high
school,
I
learned
the
mechanics
of
grammar
and
how
to
write
different
genres,
especially
analytical
and
research
papers.
I
did
well
on
all
of
my
writing
assignments,
and
I
came
to
consider
writing
to
be
one
of
my
strengths.
However,
it
was
not
until
I
reached
college
that
I
learned
how
to
write
a
true
scholarly
research
paper.
Most
of
my
writing
assignments
at
Lafayette
have
been
research-oriented
works,
but
in
my
last
year
of
high
school
and
sophomore
year
of
college,
I
discovered
that
I
had
a
real
passion
for
creative
writing
that
I
perhaps
had
not
touched
upon
since
elementary
school.
The
creative
writing
class
that
I
took
last
fall
was
my
favorite
college
class,
and
though
I
know
that
most
of
the
writing
I
will
do
at
Lafayette
will
be
of
a
more
scholarly
nature,
I
plan
to
continue
writing
creative
pieces
in
my
free
time.
I
would
love
to
write
novels
as
a
career,
and
at
the
moment
I
am
testing
out
my
abilities
as
a
creative
writer
to
determine
if
I
have
the
potential
to
make
that
dream
a
reality.
In
the
third
grade,
I
wrote
a
short
story
about
a
girl
who
discovers
a
world
where
unicorns
dwell.
Everyone
in
the
class
was
given
thin
hard-cover
books
with
wide-lined
paper
inside
that
had
room
for
illustrations
to
accompany
their
stories,
and
I
was
excited
to
write
my
first
Nbook,O
simple
as
it
may
have
been.
My
teacher
was
so
impressed
by
my
story
that
she
showed
it
to
other
faculty
members,
one
who
said
that
this
was
the
best
story
she
had
read
by
a
third
grader.
I
was
shocked
and
incredibly
pleased
when
my
teacher
told
me
this.
It
was
at
this
point
in
time
that
I
realized
I
had
a
talent
as
a
writer
and
storyteller,
a
talent
which
I
further
exercised
in
fourth
grade.
My
fourth
grade
class
put
together
a
magazine
full
of
short
stories
and
poetry
written
by
the
students,
and
I
contributed
several
works
of
short
fiction.
I
wrote
a
story
that
involved
aliens
and
missing
horses,
and
strange
as
that
may
sound,
it
was
so
well
received
that
I
wrote
a
sequel.
I
also
wrote
some
poems
for
the
magazine,
though
I
preferred
writing
fiction.
After
these
early
creative
works,
I
cannot
think
of
any
other
memorable
stages
in
my
writing
career
until
my
last
two
years
of
middle
school.
The
years
in
between
were
filled
with
learning
the
basics
of
grammar
and
applying
them
to
writing
and
exploring
different
genres.
Most
of
my
writing
assignments
were
done
in
English
classes
and
so
involved
writing
about
different
books,
often
in
the
form
of
book
reports,
which
were
essentially
plot
summaries.
I
scored
well
on
all
of
my
writing
assignments,
which
I
credit
to
my
love
of
reading.
From
an
early
age,
I
went
through
books
the
way
a
child
gobbles
down
a
bag
of
candy.
I
was
always
reading,
and
so
I
was
exposed
to
proper
grammar
and
different
writing
styles
that
helped
me
to
become
a
skilled
writer.
In
the
seventh
grade,
I
enrolled
in
a
program
through
Johns
Hopkins
University
that
allowed
me
to
take
the
SATs
early,
which
I
did
two
years
in
a
row.
Because
of
my
high
scores
on
the
verbal
section,
I
qualified
to
partake
in
a
summer
online
writing
program,
the
first
of
which
focused
on
fiction
and
the
second
on
analysis
and
persuasion.
My
writing
was
critiqued
by
both
a
teacher
and
other
students,
and
the
program
as
a
whole
was
beneficial
in
developing
my
skills
as
a
writer.
I
particularly
enjoyed
the
fiction
program,
in
which
I
was
again
able
to
test
my
ability
as
a
creative
writer,
a
skill
which
I
would
not
be
able
to
explore
often
in
middle
school
and
high
school,
where
teachers
were
more
interested
in
research-oriented
and
analytical
writing.
Most
of
the
writing
I
did
in
middle
school
and
high
school
was
in
English
classes,
where
I
would
have
to
analyze
certain
aspects
of
whatever
book
the
class
was
reading
at
the
time.
I
enjoyed
such
assignments
because
they
allowed
me
to
really
examine
a
book
and
write
about
what
that
books
meant
to
me.
Such
writing
assignments
allowed
me
to
combine
my
love
of
writing
with
my
love
of
books.
I
did
not
enjoy
research
papers
as
much,
but
then
again,
such
assignments
were
nothing
like
the
true
research
papers
that
I
have
had
to
write
in
college.
In
middle
school,
and
even
in
some
high
school
classes,
a
Nresearch
paperO
involved
looking
at
books
and
websites
(reputable
or
not)
and
writing
anything
we
found
on
the
topic.
I
was
not
often
asked
to
develop
a
true
thesis
in
which
I
would
have
to
take
a
particular
stance
on
a
subject
or
offer
some
insightful
view
of
the
topic.
I
was
initially
taught
that
a
theses
statement
simply
had
to
state
the
topic
of
an
essay.
In
middle
school,
this
could
be
as
vague
as
stating
that
two
books
had
many
similarities
and
differences.
Now,
I
cringe
at
the
thought
that
I
was
able
to
get
away
with
such
bad
writing!
In
high
school,
I
had
to
be
more
specific
with
my
thesis
statements,
but
I
still
was
rarely
asked
to
develop
a
true
hypothesis
that
I
would
have
to
prove.
I
can
only
recall
two
high
school
research
papers
where
I
had
to
include
in-text
citations.
Normally,
a
bibliography
at
the
end
was
sufficient.
As
a
college
student,
this
seems
unfathomable
to
me,
for
now
I
see
that
the
research
papers
I
did
in
middle
school
and
high
school
were
not
true
research
papers.
I
realized
this
when
I
came
to
college.
In
my
First
Year
Seminar,
I
learned
how
to
properly
cite
sources,
how
to
determine
an
appropriate
source
for
a
scholarly
essay,
and
how
to
construct
an
insightful
thesis
statement.
Considering
how
lacking
my
knowledge
of
true
research
papers
was,
it
was
surprising
that
I
did
not
struggle
as
a
college
writer.
Looking
back,
I
know
that
some
of
my
early
college
writing
assignments
were
not
as
insightful
as
they
could
have
been,
but
I
still
received
nothing
less
than
an
A-.
Even
so,
it
was
not
until
the
spring
semester
of
my
freshman
year
that
I
wrote
what
I
consider
to
be
my
first
real
research
paper.
I
was
one
of
only
two
freshmen
in
a
class
of
seniors
in
a
particularly
challenging
history
class
on
Balkan
politics.
For
our
research
paper,
we
had
to
develop
a
hypothesis
on
a
historical
event
that
we
had
studied,
or
an
educated
opinion
supported
by
facts
on
a
certain
aspect
of
Balkan
politics.
This
was
new
to
me.
Middle
school
and
high
school
history
papers
consisted
of
recounting
facts,
of
describing
what
happened,
not
trying
to
come
up
with
my
own
ideas
as
to
why
it
happened.
Moreover,
this
paper
had
to
be
at
least
twenty
pages
long,
which
would
have
been
my
longest
research
paper
yet.
The
sheer
length
was
intimidating!
All
semester
long,
I
dreaded
having
to
write
this
paper.
I
knew
that
I
was
in
an
upper-level
history
class
with
a
challenging,
demanding
professor
and
that
I
had
never
written
a
true
scholarly
paper
before.
I
spread
out
my
research
over
the
course
of
a
month,
knowing
that
it
would
take
a
lot
of
time
and
thought.
Not
only
did
I
have
to
gather
facts,
but
I
had
to
apply
them,
forming
opinions
about
them.
I
had
to
analyze
expertsO
views
on
the
topic
and
decide
whether
or
not
I
agreed
with
them.
It
was
a
difficult
assignment
for
me,
but
as
I
began
to
write,
to
combine
facts
with
analysis
and
well-supported
opinions,
I
realized
that
I
could
do
it.
In
the
end,
that
paper
was
not
as
scary
as
I
thought
it
would
be.
But
I
had
no
idea
how
well
it
would
be
received.
I
thought
that
I
had
accomplished
what
I
needed
to,
but
would
my
professor
agree?
In
the
end,
I
received
an
A
on
the
paper.
I
was
so
pleased,
not
simply
to
receive
a
good
grade,
but
to
know
that
now
I
could
write
a
true
research
paper.
This
class
was
a
major
stepping
stone
in
my
writing
career,
for
now
I
knew
what
it
took
to
write
a
strong,
thoughtful
academic
paper.
During
my
sophomore
year
of
college,
I
did
not
struggle
with
my
writing
assignments,
for
I
knew
what
to
do
at
that
point.
I
even
managed
to
write
some
longer
essays
in
French.
These
were
all
research
papers,
and
IOve
come
to
the
conclusion
that
college
writing
will
consist
mostly
of
research
papers.
Research
is
not
my
favorite
activity,
though
I
enjoy
the
actual
writing
of
the
paper.
I
like
playing
with
language,
fussing
with
my
grammar
and
sentence
structure,
using
vivid
detail
and
making
strong
points.
As
such,
it
is
natural
that
I
returned
to
creative
writing,
a
type
of
writing
that
I
learned
early
on
that
I
enjoyed
but
had
little
chance
to
actively
explore.
I
have
a
vivid
imagination.
In
truth,
I
am
a
bit
of
a
daydreamer,
but
these
daydreams
have
given
me
plenty
of
good
material
for
fiction
writing.
In
high
school,
I
began
to
think
that
I
would
like
to
be
a
novelist
one
day.
I
have
always
had
a
passion
for
books.
I
would
be
happy
to
spend
an
entire
day
doing
nothing
more
than
reading
one
of
my
favorite
fantasy
novels.
As
I
approached
my
senior
year
of
high
school,
I
began
to
think
about
writing
my
own
stories.
Could
I
write
a
book?
Did
I
have
the
talent?
I
certainly
had
the
imagination,
and
I
had
a
multitude
of
story
ideas
that
had
not
yet
made
it
to
paper.
Perhaps
part
of
me
remembered
the
praise
I
had
received
in
third
grade
for
my
storytelling
abilities,
for
I
decided
to
return
to
creative
writing.
However,
my
high
school
had
no
creative
writing
classes.
As
a
result,
I
did
an
independent
study
with
an
English
teacher,
in
which
I
wrote
on
my
own
time
rather
than
as
a
part
of
a
class.
I
enjoyed
this
tremendously
because
I
was
able
to
design
my
own
assignments.
Throughout
the
school
year,
I
wrote
two
short
stories,
one
which
was
about
twenty
pages
long,
the
other
which
was
fifty.
Both
were
in
the
fantasy
genre,
and
I
was
very
pleased
with
the
way
they
turned
out.
I
knew
then
that
I
had
to
try
to
write
a
novel-length
story
someday.
The
difficult
part
was
getting
started.
I
had
so
many
ideas,
but
the
thought
of
actually
organizing
them
into
the
plot
of
a
book
was
intimidating.
I
kept
telling
myself
that
now
was
the
time
to
start
writing,
but
nothing
ever
came
of
it.
I
received
my
inspiration
in
the
fall
of
my
sophomore
year
at
college,
in
which
I
took
a
creative
writing
class.
This
class
quickly
became
my
favorite
class
in
my
college
career.
I
had
several
assignments
each
week
in
which
I
had
to
write
about
specific
topics,
yet
the
topics
were
open
enough
that
I
could
write
about
what
interested
me.
And
if
I
really
disliked
an
assignment,
I
was
given
the
option
to
write
something
else.
My
favorite
topics
were
the
ones
that
allowed
me
to
write
in
the
fantasy
genre,
and
I
loved
it
when
we
had
open-ended
topics.
I
had
this
class
on
Friday
afternoons
for
three
full
hours,
but
I
loved
every
minute
of
it.
It
was
like
having
story
time,
as
we
shared
our
pieces
and
commented
on
one
anotherOs.
I
would
feel
so
inspired
by
the
end
of
the
class
that
I
would
have
to
go
back
to
my
room
and
start
typing
right
away.
It
was
best
if
the
professor
gave
me
the
assignments
at
the
end
of
the
class,
because
when
she
did
so
at
the
beginning,
my
mind
would
take
off,
distracting
me
from
the
class
with
all
of
my
ideas
for
my
short
stories.
The
class
was
an
incredible
experience,
and
I
received
high
praise
from
my
classmates
on
my
imaginative
works.
The
most
memorable
moment
was
when
my
professor
told
me
that
could
see
me
writing
books
some
day.
And
that
was
the
inspiration
I
needed.
This
summer
I
am
working
on
writing
a
book.
It
is
something
that
I
have
always
wanted
to
do,
and
now
I
am
converting
that
desire
into
action.
I
considered
beginning
the
book
over
winter
break
(and
several
other
times
before
that).
I
had
some
characters
in
mind
and
a
general
plot,
but
I
did
not
feel
ready
yet.
I
sat
down
and
started
to
write
an
outline,
but
too
much
was
unclear
at
the
time.
This
summer,
though,
I
became
determined
to
write
my
book.
I
spent
several
days
just
trying
to
clarify
my
ideas
in
my
head
before
I
even
began
to
write
an
outline.
I
had
a
clear
beginning
and
end,
but
only
general
ideas
about
the
middle
once
again,
and
this
worried
me.
But
this
time
I
just
started
writing.
I
knew
that
I
had
a
beginning
and
that
once
I
began
to
write,
more
ideas
would
come,
and
they
did.
I
spend
every
night
before
I
fall
asleep
just
lying
in
bed,
trying
out
different
scenes
in
my
head
that
I
may
want
to
include
in
my
story.
This
works
well,
though
it
also
means
that
if
I
come
up
with
some
good
ideas,
I
get
little
sleep
that
night.
I
do
the
same
when
I
am
on
the
treadmill,
which
is
a
great
time
to
just
let
my
mind
wander
and
gather
ideas.
It
has
been
a
fun
process,
though
not
necessarily
an
easy
one.
I
spend
a
lot
of
time
editing
before
I
move
on
to
the
next
chapter.
I
am
a
perfectionist,
and
it
is
too
easy
to
look
back
on
what
I
have
written
and
think
that
it
is
not
good
enough.
But
now
that
I
have
started,
I
have
a
determination
to
finish.
I
know
that
it
will
be
difficult
to
continue
writing
during
the
school
year,
but
even
if
it
takes
me
a
year,
I
will
complete
this
book.
This
is
my
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
I
truly
want
to
pursue
writing
as
a
career
and
to
see
if
I
have
the
skill
to
do
so.
It
would
be
a
dream
come
true
if
this
book
was
worthy
of
being
published.
So
this
semester,
I
am
sure
I
will
be
doing
plenty
of
research
papers.
As
a
Writing
Associate,
I
will
be
working
with
other
students
to
help
them
develop
and
perfect
their
own
research
papers.
And
I
will
be
spending
as
much
of
my
free
time
as
possible
working
on
this
book.
I
have
a
real
challenge
ahead
of
me,
but
I
am
looking
forward
to
tackling
it.
