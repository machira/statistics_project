WRITING
AND
ME
rHave
you
ever
written
a
paper
in
English
before?s
rWell,
yes
and
nois
I
was
scared.
That
was
my
first
7-page
paper
in
English
that
counted
for
20%
of
my
final
grade.
Writing
is
always
fun
for
me.
I
like
to
express
my
feelings.
I
like
to
do
some
research
on
specific
topics,
then
summarize
into
a
brief
essay.
By
the
time
I
came
to
Lafayette,
I
never
had
serious
problems
with
writing
an
essay.
But
it
was
different
this
time.
I
had
to
do
a
thorough
and
careful
research
on
a
controversial
case
of
human
right
abuse.
Besides,
I
had
to
write
seven
pages
while
I
only
had
experience
with
short
essays.
I
started
to
study
English
when
I
was
ten
years
old.
My
father
is
an
English
teacher
at
a
high
school.
So
naturally,
he
became
my
first
teacher
teaching
me
basic
conversations.
I
entered
middle
school
as
a
mediocre
English
learner.
I
did
not
know
anything
about
grammar,
writing
styles
or
structures.
I
could
only
speak
simple
sentences
that
I
memorized
with
my
father.
I
thought
that
I
would
learn
how
to
write
essays
in
English.
However,
since
Vietnamese
tend
to
teach
only
grammar
for
foreign
languages,
all
I
learned
was
grammar
in
middle
school.
My
assignments
included
completing
sentences,
finding
and
correcting
mistakes
in
different
sentences,
transforming
sentences
by
using
different
structures
and
putting
verbs
to
the
right
tenses.
It
was
boring.
Therefore,
unlike
my
friends
who
tried
to
study
hard
outside
of
class,
I
did
not
bother
opening
an
English
book.
I
did
not
want
to
spend
time
practicing
spoken
English
and
enlarging
vocabulary
or
phrasal
verbs.
I
believed
that
English
was
merely
a
tool
for
me
and
that
I
did
not
have
to
worry
as
long
as
I
did
well
in
class.
Not
until
I
got
into
a
special
class
in
English
in
high
school
did
I
have
to
write
a
rreals
essay
in
English.
I
remember
vividly
about
my
first
writing
assignment.
I
had
to
choose
a
topic,
write
about
it
and
then
present
the
rcomplete
essays
in
class.
I
did
not
like
the
assignment.
Never
having
written
anything
like
a
paragraph
in
my
own
words
not
to
mention
presenting
it
in
class
and
getting
comments
on
both
my
written
and
spoken
English,
I
felt
intimidated.
With
no
other
choices,
I
finally
picked
the
topic
about
British
culture,
which
I
found
in
an
old
book
that
my
father
has.
Although
it
was
simple
to
organize
the
essay
the
same
way
as
in
Vietnamese,
I
was
puzzled
with
how
to
paraphrase
the
materials
I
read.
It
took
me
so
much
time
to
look
up
suitable
vocabulary
in
the
dictionary.
Moreover,
I
realized
that
writing
complete
sentences
without
making
any
mistakes
in
tenses
or
subject-verb
agreement
was
not
as
easy
as
I
thought.
What
I
learned
in
grammar
classes
only
helped
me
in
varying
the
sentence
structures.
I
got
stuck
from
time
to
time
with
particles
or
prepositions.
Anyhow,
I
finished
writing
and
presented
that
piece
of
writing
in
class.
My
teacher
and
classmates
paid
attention
only
to
the
content,
and
did
not
give
me
any
comments
on
my
grammar
or
writing
styles.
I
was
relieved,
thinking
that
my
first
essay
was
not
a
failure.
Since
then,
every
semester
in
my
high
school
years,
I
had
to
write
two
or
three
small
essays
and
make
presentations.
It
went
smoothly
because
my
teacherus
goals
were
to
let
us
write
and
speak
English
with
confidence.
However,
I
still
felt
unconfident
about
my
essays.
What
I
needed
was
some
more
critical
comments
on
topics
like
wording
and
grammar,
not
too
much
attention
on
what
my
essay
was
about.
I
had
more
than
enough
to
write
about
my
chosen
topic
after
some
short
research
while
struggling
with
the
grammar
every
single
time.
I
knew
I
needed
more
practice.
Therefore,
I
decided
to
keep
a
diary
in
English.
I
wrote
freely.
I
wrote
about
activities
I
did
during
the
day,
about
my
classmates,
and
about
almost
everything.
I
did
not
pay
attention
to
my
grammatical
mistakes
or
my
word
choices.
Besides,
I
was
still
thinking
in
Vietnamese.
Therefore,
I
became
ignorant
about
my
weaknesses
in
writing,
and
my
diary
was
merely
a
translation.
Instead
of
trying
hard
to
express
words
or
phrases
that
I
did
not
know
in
English,
I
left
a
blank
with
a
note
in
Vietnamese.
I
did
not
bother
trying
various
sentence
structures.
I
kept
on
writing
like
that
for
a
year
or
less.
Because
I
did
not
share
it
with
anyone,
no
one
helped
me
identify
and
correct
the
mistakes.
Sometimes
I
read
it
again
but
did
not
attempt
to
change
anything.
I
thought
I
was
good.
However,
the
upside
of
keeping
such
a
diary
for
me
was
that
I
realized
my
writing
style.
I
like
simple
and
short
sentences,
and
no
fancy
words.
Besides
these
free
writings,
I
also
had
to
write
argument
essays.
It
was
not
my
assignment
but
a
required
part
of
the
TOEFL
test,
which
I
decided
to
take
to
see
my
English
ability.
Since
all
of
the
topics
were
available
on
the
web,
I
tried
to
write
a
few
samples.
My
best
friend
and
I
exchanged
our
essays
to
check
our
ideas,
and
grammar
more
objectively.
However,
the
argument
topics
were
probably
easy
enough
for
me
to
make
almost
no
mistakes
in
writing.
I
thought
that
my
writing
skills
had
improved
through
keeping
a
diary
and
doing
various
assignments
for
my
English
class.
Not
until
the
end
of
my
senior
year
in
high
school
when
I
decided
to
apply
to
US
colleges
did
I
have
to
write
an
essay
that
plays
an
important
part
in
my
application.
I
remember
my
advisor
telling
me
that
it
had
to
be
an
essay
that
could
make
me
rstand
outs
in
the
pool
of
applicants.
This
essay
was
different
from
all
of
the
other
essays
I
wrote
before.
So
I
kept
on
reading
different
application
essay
samples
to
find
ideas
from
those
successful
applicants
and
their
stories.
But
instead
of
getting
influenced
by
those
stories,
I
ended
up
writing
about
my
childhood
experience.
I
thought
it
was
a
rperfects
piece
of
writing.
It
was
thoughtful,
personal
and
positive.
I
loved
it
so
much
that
I
read
it
again
and
again.
However,
since
the
essay
was
important,
I
was
more
conscious
reading
my
own
writing.
Anytime
I
read
it,
I
made
some
changes
in
either
word
choice,
grammar
or
structure.
Therefore,
I
decided
to
ask
an
American
friend
to
proofread
it
for
me.
Just
as
I
thought,
the
ideas
in
the
essay
were
good.
However,
she
made
suggestions
for
changes
and
comments
for
almost
any
sentence.
The
first
draft
was
just
full
of
mistakes.
Although
I
was
disappointed,
I
listened
to
my
friendus
advice.
I
had
to
rewrite
and
give
her
the
drafts
for
proofread.
I
became
more
conscious
about
grammar
when
I
wrote.
I
tried
to
make
as
few
mistakes
in
verb
tenses
and
particles
as
possible.
I
realized
that
writing
was
not
just
a
one-time
process.
I
had
to
rewrite
and
rewrite.
The
more
critically
I
read
my
essay,
the
better
it
became.
Besides,
it
was
always
helpful
when
someone
other
than
me
proofread
the
essay.
I
was
satisfied
with
my
final
submission
to
the
admission
committee.
By
the
time
I
came
to
Lafayette,
I
was
confident
about
my
spoken
and
written
English.
However,
I
did
not
know
exactly
how
many
papers
and
how
long
I
would
have
to
write.
I
was
too
happy
and
busy
getting
ready
to
go
to
college
in
America
to
worry
about
writing
in
English
when
I
began
my
college
life.
Thatus
why
I
was
shocked
when
I
got
my
first
paper
assignment.
I
never
imagined
that
I
would
have
to
write
a
7-page
research
paper.
Although
I
was
still
able
to
choose
one
of
the
given
topics,
I
was
stressed
out.
I
did
not
know
where
to
begin.
The
library
section
in
which
we
were
shown
how
to
research
from
both
books
and
websites
did
not
help
me
much.
I
was
overwhelmed
with
all
the
instructions
and
suggestions.
There
were
simply
too
many
resources
to
look
for
information.
Therefore,
I
started
writing
long
before
the
assignment
was
due.
I
managed
to
find
enough
information
from
the
library
website.
As
usual,
when
I
was
done
writing,
I
was
satisfied
with
the
content
of
my
paper.
But
the
meeting
with
my
WA
intimidated
me.
He
pointed
out
the
same
mistakes
in
word
choices
and
verb
tenses
as
those
in
my
admission
essay.
At
that
time,
I
realized
that
I
still
had
a
long
way
to
go
before
my
writing
skills
improved.
After
the
first
paper
in
FYS,
which
I
was
not
so
happy
with
a
B+,
I
searched
for
help
from
both
my
professor
and
my
WA.
I
always
wrote
my
paper
at
least
a
week
before
the
due
date
to
have
it
proofread
twice.
Honestly,
I
felt
painful
when
I
wrote
my
FYS
papers.
Although
I
liked
the
topic,
it
was
not
fun
pushing
myself
to
write
correctly
anytime
I
formed
a
sentence.
Now
that
I
am
looking
back,
it
is
my
best
experience
with
writing.
I
experimented
different
approaches
to
writing.
I
was
able
to
confirm
my
strength
in
using
simple
and
short
sentences
instead
of
difficult
and
lengthy
ones.
I
was
finally
able
to
varying
my
sentence
structures
in
a
long
paper.
I
learned
from
my
professor
and
my
peer
in
both
writing
and
the
topic
we
were
examining.
I
made
significant
progress
at
the
end
of
the
first
semester
in
college.
I
was
happy.
Nevertheless,
I
still
had
a
nightmare
with
the
College
Writing
class.
Unlike
FYS,
this
class
was
purely
English.
I
had
to
write
about
my
dream
and
its
symbolic
meanings.
I
had
to
read
a
novel,
interpret
its
meaning
and
analyze
the
main
character.
Although
I
was
not
good
at
these
kinds
of
activities
in
Vietnamese,
not
to
say
in
English,
I
still
liked
the
writing
part.
I
was
able
to
implement
the
best
method
that
I
achieved
from
FYS
into
the
papers
I
wrote
and
to
make
use
of
the
WA
time.
As
a
result,
both
my
friend,
who
used
to
read
my
paper,
my
WA
and
I
were
happy
about
the
improvement.
However,
I
was
shocked
to
realize
that
my
professor
graded
grammar,
like
punctuation,
strictly.
I
became
unhappy
anytime
I
had
to
write
for
that
class.
Not
only
did
I
have
to
pay
attention
to
signing
a
comma
in
the
sentence,
I
also
had
to
carefully
add
correct
particles
by
double
checking
with
my
friend.
It
was
not
a
fun
class,
but
I
believe
that
the
College
Writing
experience
helps
to
shape
me
as
a
more
conscious
and
careful
writer.
Although
I
do
not
need
to
polish
my
paper,
I
need
to
make
sure
everything
I
write
is
grammatically
correct
and
makes
sense.
It
has
been
three
years
since
I
first
came
to
college
and
wrote
my
first
paper.
I
have
taken
a
lot
of
classes
that
require
daily
writing.
My
assignments
range
from
one
paragraph
short
answers
to
lengthy
twenty
page
research
papers.
The
topics
are
also
of
wide
ranges,
from
analysis
of
the
impacts
of
computers
in
our
lives,
policy
briefs
to
forecast
reports
of
future
GDP.
Besides
these
required
papers,
I
write
daily
blogs
in
English
to
keep
my
friends
informed
about
my
activities,
and
to
constantly
challenge
myself
to
express
complicated
thoughts
and
ideas
into
simple
and
concise
sentences.
All
of
those
various
topics
with
various
styles
help
me
improve
my
writing
significantly.
I
become
much
more
comfortable
with
writing.
I
think
in
English,
so
my
thought
flows
naturally
into
the
paper.
It
becomes
easy
and
fun
to
write
correctly.
There
is
no
more
painful
feeling
whenever
I
begin
to
write.
Although
I
still
make
mistakes
in
my
first
draft,
I
know
that
once
I
read
my
paper,
I
will
be
able
to
recognize
and
choose
better
words.
Thatus
why
I
love
the
feeling
of
re-reading
papers,
crossing
out
mistakes
and
adding
comments
and
ideas.
It
is
a
smooth
and
nice
process
in
which
I
learn
and
grow
as
a
person
as
well
as
develop
my
own
writing
skills.
