D
Writing
As
a
WA
Fall
2003
I
have
been
a
WA
for
two
years
now
and
last
year
I
had
written
about
how
the
unusual
dual
role
of
being
a
writing
associate
and
an
engineer
had
impacted
my
writing.
However,
most
of
my
formal
writing
experience
in
the
past
twelve
months
has
been
in
the
Department
of
Economics
and
Business.
Having
gotten
used
to
writing
for
engineers,
I
was
initially
apprehensive
about
writing
for
a
liberal
arts
department.
I
would
have
to
conform
to
a
new
set
of
expectations
D
different
style,
format,
tone
and
organization.
Being
a
WA,
I
was
still
confident
that
I
will
produce
good
papers.
However,
I
would
probably
need
to
put
in
more
effort
and
time.
I
was
in
for
a
big
surprise.
In
the
Fall
semester,
I
had
to
write
a
paper
for
my
Econometrics
class.
Econometrics
is
a
primarily
mathematical
subject,
and
yet,
I
was
surprised
when
the
assignment
outlined
a
paper
with
technical
attributes
D
clearly
demarcated
sections,
tables,
equations
and
to-the-point
style.
I
accomplished
the
easy
task
of
writing
the
paper
and
got
a
hundred
on
it.
A
hundred!
I
had
not
heard
of
that
before.
Since
I
had
NdiscoveredO
my
tendency
to
fish
for
mostly
positive
comments
about
my
writing
in
my
last
literacy
narrative,
and
had
promised
to
strive
to
seek
a
balanced
criticism,
I
went
to
see
the
professor
one
afternoon.
All
she
did
was
point
out
all
the
good
things
about
my
paper.
Amused,
I
asked
her
whether
she
was
eavesdropping
on
WA
staff
meetings.
That
definitely
tickled
her
for
a
while.
Having
found
the
technical
side
of
Economics
writing,
I
was
comfortable
with
my
Marketing
Science
course
which,
being
writing
intensive,
had
several
short
writing
assignments
besides
two
major
ones.
While
the
shorter
papers
were
mostly
aimed
at
explaining
my
understanding
of
concepts
discussed
in
class,
the
other
two
were
unique
for
me
in
the
sense
that
I
was
selling
a
product
D
never
before
have
I
had
to
pay
meticulous
attention
to
every
phrase
and
sentence
so
that
overall
the
writing
exuded
positivism
and
confidence.
Furthermore,
one
of
them
was
to
be
co-authored
with
another
student.
This
was
an
unprecedented
task
for
me
and
I
ran
into
unanticipated
obstacles.
Despite
a
well-planned
outline,
my
work
intersected
in
several
areas
with
that
of
my
colleague
and
we
had
to
spend
considerable
time
removing
redundancies,
ensuring
a
smooth
flow,
and
even
rewriting
certain
sections
so
as
to
remove
the
starkly
apparent
stylistic
differences.
By
the
time
we
were
finished,
I
was
skeptical
about
the
overall
benefits
of
group
work
in
writing.
However,
in
the
end,
my
two
marketing
plans
turned
out
to
be
well
researched,
organized
and
presented,
earning
me
good
grades.
As
for
my
WA
experiences,
over
the
last
year,
most
of
the
students
I
have
worked
with
have
been
non-traditional
part-time
students
of
electrical
and
computer
engineering.
All
of
them
had
full-time
jobs
and
many
had
families.
It
was
a
bit
unnerving
initially
to
sit
across
from
students
several
years
older
than
me
and
engage
them
in
intellectual
conversation
about
writing,
even
more
so
because
most
of
them
had
not
taken
a
college
writing
course
before.
I
had
to
cover
the
basics
of
an
argumentative
paper
with
most
of
them,
including
a
thorough
review
of
the
concept
of
a
thesis
statement
(the
thesis
checklist
that
we
had
prepared
during
WA
staff
meetings
was
immensely
useful).
What
struck
me
immediately,
and
eventually
helped
me
become
more
comfortable
with
my
students,
was
their
zealousness
about
the
whole
process.
Many
of
them
were
actually
interested
in
improving
their
writing
and
not
just
that
particular
piece
of
writing,
unlike
most
traditional
full-time
students.
They
had
specific
questions,
asked
for
clarifications
and
suggestions,
and
some
even
debated
the
pros
and
cons
of
particular
methods
of
organization.
Many
conversations
ended
up
being
so
engaging
that
they
extended
well
beyond
their
scheduled
time,
leaving
me
with
almost
no
break
between
conferences.
Having
overcome
the
earlier
angst,
I
started
looking
forward
to
conferences
with
part-time
students!
Besides
the
enthusiasm
they
exhibited,
the
part-time
students
stood
out
for
another
reason
D
respect
and
faith
in
their
writing
associate.
Punctuality
was
never
an
issue
with
them,
and
the
tacit
authority
they
allowed
me
gave
me
confidence
in
my
ability
to
talk
about
their
writing
and
critique
it
without
any
nagging
feelings
of
inadequacy
or
insecurity.
I
havenOt
had
a
single
student
who
undermined
my
position
as
a
writing
associate
or
our
professional
yet
peer-to-peer
relationship
due
to
the
age
difference.
While
not
many
Writing
Associates
are
likely
to
face
a
similar
situation,
I
felt
it
was
important
enough
to
be
shared
as
I
have
benefited
in
other
ways
besides
having
good
conferences.
Most
of
the
part-time
students
wrote
with
styles
that
differed
considerably
from
those
of
traditional
students,
and
possessed
some
common
elements
that
could
be
attributed
to
their
industrial
experience.
Their
writing
was
crystallized
and
unambiguous,
and
they
used
suggested
engineering
writing
rules
effectively.
I
got
to
sample
various
ways
of
using
the
rules,
reinforcing
them
in
my
mind.
The
part-time
students
approached
the
assignment
differently,
broadening
my
perspective
and
hence
changing
the
way
I
conducted
conferences
with
other
students.
Of
course,
I
have
come
across
papers
that
were
extremely
well
written
and
organized,
and
in
the
process
of
trying
to
point
out
all
the
positive
things
about
the
paper
I
have
reinforced
and
learnt
some
good
writing
practices
myself.
I
had
another
new
experience
being
a
WA
during
the
course
of
last
year
that
some
other
WAs
may
encounter
D
failure
on
part
of
the
professor
to
deal
with
missed
conferences.
A
student
missed
his
scheduled
appointment
and
returned
my
call
two
hours
later
requesting
to
reschedule
for
that
same
night.
Since
the
paper
was
due
the
next
day,
I
complied.
However,
he
missed
his
second
appointment
and
called
me
half
an
hour
after
the
scheduled
time
to
set
up
a
third
appointment.
Trying
not
to
be
exasperated
by
wasted
time,
I
reminded
him
of
the
consequences
the
professor
had
outlined
to
me,
and
rescheduled
for
close
to
midnight.
Eventually,
he
did
show
up,
but
15
minutes
late.
A
second
student
from
the
same
course
hadnOt
responded
to
my
emails
asking
to
set
up
an
appointment.
He
called
me
five
hours
before
the
paper
was
due,
requesting
to
confer
immediately
as
the
professor
was
not
going
to
accept
papers
that
havenOt
been
discussed
with
the
WA.
Since
I
was
unable
to
meet
with
him
on
such
short
notice,
the
professor
offered
to
discuss
the
paper
with
him
before
being
submitted.
These
two
incidences
occurred
during
the
last
set
of
conferences,
and
it
being
a
summer
session,
the
professor
let
them
slide.
While
it
is
the
professorOs
prerogative
to
make
decisions
regarding
grading,
I
felt
that
his
inaction
undermined
WA
credibility
in
general.
New
WAs
may
therefore
make
it
a
point
to
discuss
consequences
clearly
at
the
onset
of
the
semester.
Reflecting
on
the
development
of
my
writing
during
the
course
of
last
year,
I
can
notice
a
few
broad
changes.
Overall,
I
have
become
a
more
comfortable
writer
and
tackle
writing
assignments
with
less
apprehension
and
anxiety
than
before.
My
writing
has
ceased
to
be
an
effort
to
impress.
Rather,
I
use
it
for
what
it
is
D
a
tool
to
effectively
communicate
my
thoughts
to
the
target
audience.
Consequently,
I
am
in
control
of
my
writing
and
often
pause
to
change
words
or
phrases
to
better
reflect
what
I
want
to
convey
as
opposed
to
letting
words
dictate
what
and
how
I
pen.
Related
to
this
development,
I
have
overcome
my
tendency
to
indulge
in
bombast
and
try
to
focus
more
on
the
ideas
being
conveyed.
I
have
also
successfully
battled
with
my
NwriterOs
ego,O
about
which
I
had
talked
in
my
last
literacy
narrative,
resulting
in
me
being
more
open
to
a
balanced
criticism
and
even
actively
seeking
it.
All
in
all,
I
feel
I
have
matured
as
a
writer
D
and
hence
am
excited
for
another
year
of
writing
as
a
WA!
