NWhat
would
you
like
to
be
when
you
grow
up?O
A
womanOs
shrill
voice
echoed
in
the
ears
of
her
rowdy
first-grade
students.
I,
a
clueless
seven
year-old,
stared
at
the
lines
on
the
apple-shaped
paper
and
racked
my
brain,
attempting
to
remember
what
occupation
my
parents
held
and
the
other
jobs
I
knew
existed.
Deciding
to
give
up,
I
went
along
with
the
rest
of
my
female
classmates:
NI
want
to
be
a
teacher,O
I
wrote
slowly
in
pencil.
I
was
extra
careful
to
cross
my
tOs
and
stay
within
the
horizontal
blue
lines
running
across
the
paper.
The
following
year,
assignments
that
consisted
of
one
sentence
increased
to
a
few
pages.
Two
pieces
of
second
grade
homework
that
stand
out
in
my
mind
were
the
Ntall
taleO
and
the
fable,
both
of
which
I
had
to
invent.
The
two
assignments
were
my
first
opportunities
to
create
my
own
imaginative
stories
from
loose
guidelines.
My
tale
introduced
giants
who
had
a
water
balloon
fight.
The
resulting
puddles
from
the
balloon
battle
eventually
created
the
Great
Lakes.
The
fable
was
given
to
us
a
bit
later,
and
we
were
asked
to
come
up
with
a
moral
for
our
story.
My
fable
included
two
porcupines
who
were
best
friends.
They
both
attended
a
party
and
got
in
a
fight
and
the
moral
of
the
story
stressed
the
importance
of
apology.
My
teacher
liked
the
two
stories
a
great
deal,
especially
the
pictures
I
drew
accompanying
the
stories.
My
artwork
for
my
stories
continued
to
get
more
complex
just
like
my
writing.
My
fourth
grade
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Agnese,
was
a
delightful
soft-spoken
woman
with
glasses
and
short
blond
hair
who
was
filled
with
compliments
for
all
of
her
students.
At
one
point
in
class,
we
read
Pippi
Longstocking
Goes
to
the
Circus
and
we
were
asked
to
choose
an
event
in
the
book
and
narrate
it
through
a
first
person
view
as
opposed
to
a
third
person
perspective.
We
were
able
to
choose
from
one
of
three
characters:
Pippi,
Annika,
and
Tommy.
I
chose
to
record
the
part
where
the
main
character,
Pippi,
climbs
into
the
lionOs
mouth.
I
remembered
from
past
novels
that
the
wacky
unique
red-headed
girl
had
very
poor
grammar.
To
reflect
this
through
PippiOs
interpretation
of
the
event,
I
spelled
a
simple
word
incorrectly.
But
to
my
dismay,
Mrs.
Agnese
corrected
the
mistake.
She
interpreted
my
attempt
at
creativity
as
my
poor
grammar
skills.
At
the
time,
I
couldnOt
put
into
words
as
a
fourth
grader
what
I
wanted
to
reveal
about
PippiOs
character
through
the
misspelling
and
just
corrected
my
mistake.
I
adored
creative
writing
assignments,
and
I
was
extremely
happy
to
find
they
would
be
given
the
following
year
in
elementary
school.
My
fifth
year
at
Donovan
School
was
the
first
time
I
was
given
free
rein
to
determine
the
content
of
my
papers.
I
was
thrilled!
Using
my
knowledge
of
fantasy
from
all
the
books
I
had
been
reading,
I
scribbled
down
stories
about
little
girls
who
encountered
unicorns,
magic,
dolphins,
dragons,
and
a
myriad
of
other
concepts
that
could
only
be
taken
from
the
imagination.
Excerpts
from
almost
every
paper
I
wrote
for
Mr.
Russomano
were
read
to
the
class
because
he
enjoyed
my
stories
so
much.
Although
I
really
liked
the
class
and
the
assignments,
it
was
the
first
time
I
became
aware
of
a
problem
with
my
compositions.
My
stories
always
exceeded
the
limit
by
one
or
two
pages
because
I
would
get
so
involved
in
the
story
I
was
creating,
I
wouldnOt
pay
attention
to
how
much
paper
I
was
filling
up.
But
that
defect
didnOt
bother
my
teacher,
who
remarked
on
the
descriptive
detail
of
my
pieces,
and
never
penalized
me
for
the
excessive
length.
Also
to
my
delight,
as
a
fifth
grader,
we
were
finally
given
the
permission
to
write
in
pen!
In
addition
to
this
opportunity,
computer
classes
also
became
part
of
the
weekly
schedule.
We
soon
learned
how
to
type
up
all
of
our
assignments
on
Apple
Computers.
As
time
went
on,
Apple
computers
changed
to
new,
more
complex
IBMs,
and
soon
I
was
attempting
to
type
without
looking
at
the
keyboard.
In
sixth
grade,
however,
creative
writing
compositions
typed
out
on
the
computer
were
replaced
by
step-by-step
papers,
argument
papers,
and
poems.
The
most
uninventive
paper
I
wrote
in
elementary
school,
by
far,
was
assigned
by
my
sixth
grade
teacher.
We
had
to
choose
any
process,
and
write
out
each
step,
directing
the
reader
through
the
tasks
toward
the
goal
we
chose.
Our
teacher
hoped
that
by
having
to
write
this
paper,
we
would
get
practice
in
using
transitions
throughout
our
writing,
such
as
NfirstO,
NnextO,
NfinallyO,
etc.
Another
memorable
draft
we
had
to
compose
was
a
nonfiction
argument
paper.
I
chose
to
write
about
the
problem
of
cutting
down
rainforests
and
the
resulting
consequences.
That
same
year,
in
addition
to
factual
writing,
we
experimented
with
many
different
styles
of
poetry,
and
were
told
to
compile
them
into
a
booklet
with
pictures.
Poetry
is
what
saved
me
from
becoming
incredibly
bored
in
sixth
grade.
Outside
of
the
school
environment,
I
applied
to
be
one
of
a
half
dozen
young
reviewers
for
the
Asbury
Park
Press,
one
of
New
JerseyOs
major
daily
newspapers.
After
accepting
my
application,
each
month
for
one
year
the
paper
sent
different
books
coinciding
with
my
age
level
that
I
was
to
keep,
read
and
report
about.
My
family
did
not
yet
own
a
computer,
and
I
remember
having
to
type
everything
on
our
typewriter
which
is
now
dusty
and
obsolete
in
2004.
Although
I
didnOt
get
paid,
it
was
fun
being
able
to
receive
free
books
and
see
my
picture
in
the
paper.
It
wasnOt
surprising
that
the
Asbury
Park
Press
picked
me
for
the
job.
Both
of
my
parents
were
librarians
and
I
had
been
reading
since
I
was
in
kindergarten.
I
also
brought
books
with
me
on
family
vacations
overseas,
mostly
to
read
when
my
mom
and
dad
were
looking
at
the
mundane
paintings
lining
the
walls
of
art
museums.
My
parents
encouraged
me
to
write
about
the
books
I
read
in
the
family
journal
my
mom
kept.
As
the
years
went
on,
I
eventually
included
book
lists
in
my
own
journal,
as
well
as
recording
all
of
my
personal
experiences
in
the
foreign
country.
Ever
since
I
was
in
sixth
grade,
I
have
continued
to
bring
my
own
journal
to
every
destination
IOve
traveled
to,
including
Australia,
Slovakia,
Finland,
Germany,
Hungary,
France
England,
Austria,
Estonia,
Scotland
and
Ireland.
Not
only
does
a
journal
serve
as
a
written
history
when
looking
back
at
my
experiences,
but
it
also
allows
me
to
see
how
my
values
and
goals
have
changed
and
developed
as
I
have
grown
older.
I
think
this
constant
practice
in
narrating
events
helped
me
greatly
when
I
applied
for
admission
to
a
special
Nsmart
kidO
program
in
my
regional
high
school
district.
The
application
included
a
few
short
answer
questions
as
well
as
two
essay
questions.
When
I
was
accepted
into
the
selective
NHumanitiesO
program,
I
was
extremely
excited.
The
program
focused
on
history,
English
and
literature,
with
classes
more
advanced
than
NHonors.O
Humanities
was
filled
with
weekly
oral
presentations,
videos
we
had
to
create
in
groups,
research
papers,
debates,
persuasive
pieces,
and
Advanced
Placement
essays
to
prep
us
for
college.
In
addition
to
all
of
this
English
writing,
I
took
Spanish
classes
throughout
high
school,
and
was
also
a
student
in
classes
that
required
labs,
such
as
chemistry
and
biology.
Lab
reports
were
not
as
difficult
to
write
as
the
papers
in
Humanities,
but
still
proved
to
be
challenging,
and
one
page
Spanish
compositions
were
difficult
for
me.
Poetry,
pretty
much
nonexistent
in
middle
school,
returned
to
my
writing
in
9th
grade.
As
a
girl
filled
with
teen-angst,
I
began
my
own
book
of
poetry.
Most
of
the
book
was
full
of
free-verse
poems,
but
a
few
pages
were
filled
with
couplets.
All
of
my
pieces
were
mostly
about
boys,
death
of
family
members,
and
clashes
with
best
friends.
With
the
exception
of
one
or
two
poems,
I
never
shared
my
book
with
anyone
else,
until
I
got
a
boyfriend
of
two
years.
He
was
the
only
person
I
let
into
my
deepest
thoughts.
I
also
let
him
read
my
college
application
essays.
Because
I
wanted
to
receive
as
much
feedback
as
possible
from
my
college
application
essays,
I
asked
both
of
my
parents,
an
English
teacher,
and
my
guidance
counselor
for
their
opinions.
In
high
school,
I
was
so
tired
of
uneventful
nonfiction
assignments
that
I
composed
unusual
beginnings
for
both
of
my
pieces,
jumping
straight
into
describing
an
action
scene
without
a
boring
introduction.
After
my
English
teacher
read
what
I
had
written,
she
suggested
I
be
more
conventional
and
start
with
boring
scene-setting
rather
than
with
action.
I
was
disappointed
and
asked
for
a
second
opinion
before
demolishing
the
most
interesting
aspect
of
my
essay.
After
all,
I
thought,
wouldnOt
the
admissions
office
want
to
read
something
intriguing
and
different
from
the
normal
application?
My
guidance
counselor,
a
former
admissions
officer
for
Swarthmore
College,
wholeheartedly
agreed
with
me,
and
helped
me
enhance
the
first
paragraph.
It
was
extremely
pleasing
to
hear
that
my
creativity
with
the
introductions
did
not
go
unnoticed.
He
actually
helped
me
enrich
my
paragraphs
with
a
few
more
beautiful
details.
He
loved
that
I
attempted
to
be
unique
and
exciting
in
my
writing.
My
guidance
counselorOs
attitude
toward
my
writing
style
reminded
me
of
the
positive
reactions
I
received
in
elementary
and
middle
school,
and
it
was
very
encouraging.
My
parents
had
a
similar
reaction
to
my
essays.
They
too
enjoyed
my
descriptive
imaginative
introductions,
and
as
always,
my
father
helped
me
edit
some
parts
of
my
essays
to
make
points
clearer
by
deleting
some
superfluous
words.
I
sent
in
my
essays,
my
grades,
my
SAT
scores,
and
my
English
Grammar
AP
exam
score
and
received
an
acceptance
letter
from
Lafayette
College.
Despite
the
encouragement
and
arduous
preparation
I
received
in
high
school,
I
was
in
for
a
rude
awakening
at
Lafayette
College.
Constructive
criticism
became
unavoidable
my
freshman
year,
despite
my
prowess
for
grammar
and
the
AP
exam
score
which
placed
me
out
of
College
Writing.
My
first
year
seminar
professor
tore
apart
my
papers,
and
like
the
English
teacher
from
high
school,
crossed
out
my
unorthodox
introductions.
One
particular
paper
was
filled
with
comments
in
the
margin,
and
red
marks
defaced
every
page.
Despite
this
discouraging
feedback,
she
taught
us
some
valuable
lessons
that
I
still
use
today
in
my
papers.
I
learned
that
conclusions
should
never
start
with
the
words
Nin
conclusionO,
or
even
restating
the
thesis.
The
conclusion
is
the
place
where
the
writer
informs
the
reader
what
has
been
proven,
and
more
importantly,
why
the
information
is
significant.
I
am
thankful
she
let
us
rewrite
our
papers
again
and
again,
incorporating
her
corrections
and
thoughts
into
the
content
of
our
assignments.
My
psychology
teacher,
however,
was
not
as
lenient.
That
same
year,
I
received
more
criticism
on
my
writing,
but
this
time
on
my
lab
reports.
I
received
my
first
NDO
on
a
paper
in
my
whole
life
as
a
writer.
What
made
things
worse
was
that
I
couldnOt
improve
the
grade.
I
was
crushed
and
angry.
But
what
I
later
discovered
was
that
the
lab
report
was
graded
harshly
in
order
to
get
the
students
to
take
assignments
seriously
and
pay
attention
to
detail,
something
I
prided
myself
on
in
English
but
couldnOt
seem
to
do
in
my
lab
reports.
I
ended
up
doing
pretty
well
in
the
class
grade-wise
after
I
came
to
that
realization.
Another
significant
thing
I
learned
in
the
Introduction
to
Psychology
lab
was
how
to
write
in
APA
style.
As
a
psychology
major
now,
IOm
glad
I
was
introduced
early
to
the
format.
My
sophomore
year
was
a
bit
more
manageable
following
my
acclimation
to
the
professorsO
criticism
of
my
papers.
After
taking
four
years
of
Spanish
in
high
school,
I
decided
to
add
Advanced
Spanish
to
my
class
schedule.
The
course
turned
out
to
be
overwhelming
at
first,
but
I
learned
a
lot
and
had
a
very
helpful
and
supportive
professor.
Looking
back
on
that
year,
the
aspect
that
amazed
me
the
most
in
the
class
was
my
ability
to
write
a
five
page
paper
all
in
a
non-native
language
for
me
about
a
famous
Spanish
play
we
read.
It
was
the
most
I
had
ever
written
in
Spanish,
and
it
addressed
an
extended
work
in
a
different
language.
As
opposed
to
Spanish
assignments
in
the
past
for
which
I
needed
to
apply
my
imagination
and
opinion,
Advanced
Spanish
was
more
demanding.
I
had
to
not
only
apply
vocabulary
I
had
learned
in
high
school,
but
also
had
to
use
my
grammar
skills,
and
knowledge
about
writing
a
college
essay.
My
second
most
prominent
writing
class
sophomore
year
was
London
Theatre,
an
interim
course
where
we
traveled
to
England
and
Ireland.
I
signed
up
for
the
course
thinking
it
would
be
easy
to
watch
plays
and
evaluate
them.
But
reviews
for
me
were
extremely
difficult
to
create,
especially
because
I
would
either
include
too
much
plot
synopsis
or
write
in
the
style
of
a
research
paper,
as
opposed
to
the
less
formal
reviewing
style.
Until
then,
the
closest
assignments
I
had
to
reviews
in
this
class
were
the
articles
in
the
Asbury
Park
Press
that
I
wrote
reviewing
books
in
fourth
grade.
On
the
first
theatre
paper
I
received
a
C,
but
after
talking
to
the
professors
individually
and
finding
out
exactly
what
they
wanted,
I
got
a
higher
grade
on
my
second
composition.
As
I
look
back
on
all
of
the
tasks
IOve
accomplished
in
writing,
itOs
surprising
how
much
IOve
grown
as
a
writer.
IOve
learned
a
great
deal
about
my
own
skills
through
peer
editing
and
comments
from
teachers
and
professors.
But
reminiscing
also
brings
to
my
attention
how
much
more
I
still
have
to
be
taught
in
order
to
fully
develop
my
writing
experience
into
an
expertise.
