The
direction
in
which
education
starts
a
man
will
determine
his
future
life
(Plato).
Effective
writers
are
often
products
of
involved
parents
and
inspiring
teachers
who
work
to
instill
the
idea
of
self-expression
from
an
early
age.
Many
writers
discover
their
passion
for
the
written
word
as
young
children.
The
genres
that
a
writer
encounters
may
become
more
complex
as
time
passes.
However,
the
building
blocks
of
communication,
such
as
the
alphabet,
were
not
so
easy
in
the
beginning.
My
first
memory
of
writing
consists
of
three
major
components:
a
pencil,
a
huge
eraser,
and
a
green
marble
notebook.
The
notebook
was
extremely
wide
ruled,
and
a
dotted
line
was
printed
within
each
space.
This
dotted
line
served
as
a
height
line
for
lowercase
letters;
of
course,
there
were
exceptions
like
h,
d,
and
f.
My
kindergarten
teacher
had
us
write
endless
columns
of
every
letter
of
the
alphabet.
I
found
this
to
be
annoying;
I
learned
to
write
my
name
at
age
three,
and
no
one
cared
how
crooked
the
letters
were.
Yet,
Mrs.
Virtulo
had
her
students
erase
holes
in
the
paper
until
every
capital
letter
(and
the
tall
lowercase
letters)
met
the
tippy
top
of
the
line
and
the
remaining
letters
touched
the
dotted
line.
The
goal
of
each
assignment
was
to
receive
the
stamp
of
approval,
the
red
star.
A
lollipop
was
given
to
each
student
who
received
ten
red
stars
in
three
weeks.
I
remember
the
excitement
I
felt
as
I
traveled
home
on
the
school
bus
and
tightly
clutched
the
lollipop
in
my
tiny
hand.
The
pride
and
excitement
reached
a
different
level,
though,
when
I
saw
my
mother's
admiring
smile
each
time
I
came
home
with
a
treat.
I
loved
knowing
that
she
was
proud
of
my
hard
work.
At
the
conclusion
of
the
school
year,
my
parents
were
notified
that
I
was
eligible
for
the
Intellectually
Gifted
Children's
Program.
However,
I
was
already
registered
to
attend
St.
Benedict
School.
As
a
second
grade
student
at
St.
Benedict
School,
I
was
given
a
Gold
Book
to
complete
in
order
to
prepare
for
receiving
my
first
Holy
Communion.
The
book
consisted
of
stories
to
read,
questions
to
answer,
and
boxes
to
illustrate
my
ideas.
Each
chapter
had
a
theme,
and
the
story
of
the
chapter
taught
a
lesson
about
that
theme.
The
questions
varied
from
What
can
you
do
in
your
community
to
show
your
love
for
God?
to
Which
four
people
in
your
life
help
you
to
learn
about
God?
Every
Saturday
afternoon,
my
mother
would
help
me
work
on
completing
the
Gold
Book.
I
always
enjoyed
reading
the
stories
and
writing
down
my
answers
to
the
multitude
of
questions.
However,
I
always
hated
the
drawing
aspect.
My
triangular-shaped
people
lacked
hands,
and
my
birds
were
flying
check
marks.
I
was
not
allowed
to
erase
any
of
my
mistakes
because
my
parents
feared
I
might
tear
the
page.
Finishing
the
last
page
of
the
book
was
an
achievement,
and
as
my
two
younger
sisters
spent
time
on
their
own
Gold
Books,
I
compared
my
thoughts
to
the
ideas
they
had.
It
was
interesting
to
see
both
the
similarities
and
differences
in
opinions
among
eight-year-olds.
Each
of
us
had
certain
likes
and
dislikes
about
the
book
and
the
messages
it
put
forth.
My
fifth
grade
composition/English
teacher,
Ms.
LaVia,
was
the
first
person
who
gave
me
the
option
to
write
about
something
I
liked.
Ms.
LaVia
described
a
research
paper
as
a
work
of
art
that
requires
a
lot
of
time,
patience,
and
hard
work.
She
told
her
students
that
a
certain
pattern
of
steps
needed
to
be
followed
in
order
to
write
a
research
paper,
and
each
phase
(brainstorming,
topic
card,
bibliography,
outline,
and
note
cards)
had
to
be
handed
in
on
a
certain
date
before
the
final
copy
was
due.
At
this
point,
I
decided
that
I
hated
research
papers!
When
I
arrived
home
from
school,
I
told
my
mother
about
this
burdensome
task.
She
replied,
What
do
you
want
to
write
about?
I
decided
that
dancing
was
going
to
be
my
topic
(I
attended
dance
class
five
days
a
week),
and
my
mother
tried
to
reason
that
dancing
was
too
broad
of
a
topic.
In
order
to
prove
her
point,
she
took
me
to
the
library
and
showed
me
a
list
of
everything
that
was
available
on
that
subject.
Three
Famous
Ballerinas
suddenly
became
a
much
better
choice.
I
quickly
became
fascinated
with
all
of
the
information
I
was
reading,
but
I
did
find
the
introductory
work
difficult.
Not
only
was
this
assignment
my
first
encounter
with
research,
it
was
my
first
experience
with
constructive
criticism.
Ms.
LaVia
told
me
that
I
had
a
great
deal
of
potential;
however,
I
was
not
fulfilling
it
because
of
my
lack
of
effort
in
the
preparatory
stages.
I
realized
that
these
steps
were
crucial
in
developing
a
well-written
paper,
and
I
finally
received
an
A
for
this
project.
It
was
very
upsetting,
though,
to
deal
with
criticism
for
the
first
time.
I
was
especially
frustrated
when
I
discovered
that
my
parents
agreed
with
her.
Another
writing
act
for
which
I
faced
criticism
was
my
eighth
grade
valedictorian
speech.
I
spent
numerous
hours
developing
the
perfect
greeting,
noting
the
funniest
memories,
and
choosing
big
words
that
I
thought
would
enhance
my
speech.
About
a
week
and
a
half
prior
to
graduation,
I
submitted
my
speech
to
the
principal
for
approval.
Mr.
Neilson
called
me
down
to
his
office
and
politely
explained
that
my
speech
sounded
overly
rehearsed.
He
said,
Lose
the
big
words,
and
write
your
speech
as
if
you
were
talking
to
your
fellow
graduates.
To
say
I
was
crestfallen
was
an
understatement.
I
revised
my
speech
for
the
next
few
days,
and
upon
completing
this
writing
act,
I
read
it
to
my
best
friend
(who
is
still
my
best
friend
today).
When
she
began
to
cry,
I
realized
that
my
speech
was
now
personal
and
addressed
the
proper
audience,
my
peers.
The
encouragement,
praise,
and
criticism
I
received
in
elementary
school
prepared
me
to
attend
a
high
school
with
a
National
Blue
Ribbon
in
English,
St.
Catharine
Academy.
Throughout
high
school,
I
was
exposed
to
many
forms
of
analytic
and
creative
writing.
My
sophomore
Honors
English
teacher
placed
a
great
emphasis
on
informal
and
creative
writing,
such
as
diary
entries.
I
wrote
diary
entries
from
a
variety
of
perspectives,
such
as
Portia
from
The
Merchant
of
Venice
and
Nora
from
A
Doll's
House.
These
assignments
enabled
me
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
literary
characters.
By
combining
my
personal
insights
and
the
background
given
on
a
specific
character,
I
was
able
to
form
a
creative
analysis
of
what
was
going
on
in
a
literary
figure's
head.
In
senior
year
of
high
school,
I
took
two
English
classes
through
St.
John's
University:
Effective
Writing
and
Major
American
Authors.
While
taking
Effective
Writing,
Mr.
Dawson
instructed
his
class
to
write
a
personal
narrative,
which
involved
taking
a
significant
event
of
our
past
and
turning
it
into
a
ten-page
story.
However,
the
occurrence
had
to
be
intertwined
with
a
recent
event
as
well.
I
chose
to
write
about
the
trips
my
grandmother
and
I
used
to
take
to
Manhattan
and
continued
to
explain
how
I
venture
to
New
York
City
with
my
little
sister,
age
nine,
today.
My
first
draft
consisted
of
two
separate
stories,
one
of
the
past
and
one
of
the
present.
Obviously,
I
still
had
much
work
to
do.
Six
drafts
later,
I
had
composed
one
of
the
best
pieces
of
writing
that
I
had
ever
written.
The
essay
began
with
a
current
conversation
between
my
little
sister
and
I,
which
was
followed
by
a
seven-page
flashback
to
my
own
childhood
adventures
to
Manhattan.
Finally,
it
reverted
back
to
my
sister
and
I
stepping
off
the
bus.
The
A+
I
received
on
my
memoir
was
worth
the
hours
of
editing
I
endured.
However,
the
most
rewarding
aspect
of
the
assignment
was
the
first
tear
that
trickled
down
my
grandmother's
cheek
when
she
read
the
final
copy.
On
June
14,
1998,
I
graduated
third
in
my
class
from
St.
Catharine
Academy.
I
felt
adequately
prepared
for
college
writing.
Although
my
continuity
was
not
up
to
par,
I
thought
that
my
grammar,
style,
and
creativity
would
enable
me
to
excel
in
my
future
writing
endeavors.
I
expected
college
level
writing
to
be
a
longer
version
of
high
school
level
writing.
Therefore,
nothing
could
have
prepared
me
for
the
shock
I
received
at
about
1:30
P.M.
on
August
31,
1998.
This
was
the
moment
during
which
sixteen
nervous
freshmen
(on
the
first
day
of
class)
discovered
that
they
had
to
write
a
twenty-page
paper
within
the
next
two
months.
The
professor
sounded
like
a
tough
grader
and
informed
us
that
check-up
assignments
were
due
along
the
way
to
ensure
that
we
did
not
procrastinate.
I
walked
upstairs
to
my
room,
picked
up
the
phone,
and
called
my
mother
hysterically
crying.
A
few
days
later,
I
walked
into
Skillman
Library
for
the
first
time
since
orientation,
and
I
was
immediately
overwhelmed
with
the
amount
of
material
that
appeared
before
me.
After
typing
the
word
individualism
into
the
computer,
I
was
given
about
a
thousand
entries.
I
entered
divorce
and
received
numerous
suggestions
as
well.
I
spent
six
hours
in
the
library
that
Saturday
afternoon,
and
I
left
with
about
seven
books.
The
first
draft
was
due
in
about
eight
weeks,
and
I
never
worked
on
an
assignment
with
such
diligence.
Several
classes
after
the
drafts
were
handed
in,
the
professor
entered
the
room
and
told
us
how
horrible
the
papers
were.
Another
round
of
tears
followed
about
an
hour
later.
My
roommate
cried
too;
she
was
also
a
student
in
my
First
Year
Seminar.
I
set
up
a
conference
with
my
professor,
and
when
I
left
his
office,
I
was
still
uncertain
about
defining
my
thesis
and
including
his
suggested
information.
I
made
two
more
trips
to
the
library
and
handed
in
a
second
draft
about
two
weeks
later.
The
professor
told
me
that
my
second
draft
showed
much
promise,
and
he
said
a
B+
looked
probable.
This
phrase
pushed
me
to
work
harder;
this
research
paper
was
worth
fifty
percent
of
my
grade.
On
November
9,
1998,
I
handed
in
about
twenty-six
pages
of
written
work,
and
I
received
an
A-.
I
was
extremely
proud
of
this
accomplishment
because
I
knew
that
I
worked
up
to
my
potential
for
this
grade.
This
research
paper
taught
me
that
a
piece
of
writing
is
never
perfect;
there
is
always
room
for
improvement.
As
a
Writing
Associate,
I
will
assist
others
in
enhancing
their
writing
skills,
not
perfecting
them.
