Writing

Program:
Narrative
Due:
August
15,
2008
The
Story
of
My
Writing:
Macaroni
to
Macintosh
Pasta,
believe
it
or
not,
was
my
first
introduction
to
writing.
More
specifically,
the
macaroni
elbow
was
the
first
tool
I
used
to
learn
the
alphabet.
In
preschool
macaroni
elbows
were
a
cheap
way
to
make
a
craft
project
a
learning
experience;
with
some
glue
and
glitter
these
macaroni
elbows
formed
the
letters
of
the
alphabet.
When
I
graduated
into
kindergarten
I
traded
the
macaroni
for
a
crayon
and
simple
letters
were
combining
into
words.
Over
the
years,
my
writing
has
progressed
through
a
series
of
changes.
In
elementary
school
I
wrote
journal
entries,
which
helped
me
set
a
foundation
for
my
writing.
These
narratives
made
me
feel
comfortable
with
my
writing
as
well
as
increased
my
vocabulary
and
grammar
skills.
In
middle
school
I
learned
how
to
analyze,
use
sources,
and
organize
my
sentences
into
paragraphs.
High
school
prepared
me
for
college
by
teaching
me
how
to
expand
ideas,
analyze
sources,
develop
a
writing
style
and
introduce
me
to
MLA
format.
The
skills
I
have
learned
through
out
my
years
of
school
have
shaped
me
into
the
writer
I
am
today.
My
first
grade
teacher,
Mrs.
Levine,
gave
the
class
weekly
spelling
tests
with
words
like
cat,
hat,
mat,
and
bat.
These
tests
would
build
our
vocabulary.
I
remember
writing
each
of
the
spelling
words
ten
times
so
I
would
know
how
the
words
were
spelled
for
the
test
at
the
end
of
the
week.
The
weekly
spelling
tests
lasted
all
year
and
continued
throughout
elementary
school
with
every
teacher.
For
me,
spelling
tests
were
easy
because
I
would
practice
spelling
the
words
everyday
on
the
way
to
school.
At
this
stage,
my
writing
was
incredibly
basic.
Mrs.
Linde,
my
second
grade
teacher,
continued
the
spelling
tests
with
harder
words
like
their,
there,
theyOre,
would,
could,
and
should.
By
understanding
the
meanings
of
these
similar
words,
I
was
able
to
use
them
correctly
in
my
writing.
The
only
difference
between
first
and
second
grade
was
the
spelling
tests
in
second
grade
were
to
be
written
in
script.
Mrs.
Linde
believed
that
script
was
the
only
proper
and
formal
way
to
write.
So
in
the
beginning
of
the
year,
she
introduced
script
grips
to
the
class.
Script
grips
were
special
grips
that
would
slip
over
the
pencil
to
ensure
that
students
held
the
pencil
properly.
These
grips
were
my
worst
nightmare.
The
class
spent
hours
practicing
how
to
write
the
alphabet
and
spell
their
names.
By
the
end
of
the
day,
my
fingers
were
bright
red
and
unbelievably
sore.
Mrs.
Linde
made
us
write
all
of
our
assignments
in
script
and
she
graded
the
class
based
on
neatness.
For
example,
everyone
in
the
class
had
a
journal
and
we
had
to
record
everything
we
did
that
day.
Despite
my
aching
fingers,
I
practiced
writing
every
night
and
I
did
well
in
second
grade.
As
I
advanced
into
third
grade,
my
teacher
Mrs.
Delgado
subscribed
to
Mrs.
LindeOs
philosophy.
She
wanted
the
class
to
write
everything
in
script
including
spelling
tests,
journal
entries,
and
homework.
The
spelling
tests
became
more
troublesome
because
not
only
did
I
have
to
take
the
tests
in
script,
but
the
words
were
getting
more
challenging.
I
was
tested
on
words
like
deception,
intervene,
and
exposure.
In
spite
of
this,
my
vocabulary
grew
and
I
became
more
expressive
with
my
writing.
In
fourth
grade,
my
teacher
Mrs.
McKevitt
was
a
history
fanatic.
My
writing
was
becoming
more
diverse
because
not
only
was
I
writing
essays
for
English,
but
also
for
history.
My
papers
were
based
on
books
we
read
in
class
and
described
historic
events
like
the
Civil
War
and
Bunker
Hill.
In
addition,
I
started
writing
book
reports
and
making
diagrams.
At
the
time,
my
writing
was
being
graded
on
whether
or
not
it
demonstrated
my
understanding
of
the
material.
There
was
so
much
information
I
wanted
to
convey
in
my
essays
that
I
had
trouble
organizing
all
of
my
thoughts.
As
a
result,
my
teacher
started
to
teach
us
about
brainstorming
and
thought
webs.
In
addition,
I
learned
the
steps
of
the
Writing
Process:
brainstorming,
draft,
edit,
peer
revision,
and
final
draft.
These
methods
greatly
improved
the
clarity
of
my
papers
because
it
helped
me
group
together
similar
thoughts
and
fluently
connect
all
of
my
ideas.
I
started
taking
honors
writing
classes
in
fifth
grade.
My
teacher
Ms.
Natoli
gave
the
class
writing
assignments
that
required
us
to
write
in
third
person
as
well
as
informal
and
formal
voice.
She
wanted
us
to
learn
about
writing
perspectives,
sentence
variation
and
syntax.
These
techniques
made
my
essays
more
appealing
to
the
audience.
Ms.
Natoli
wanted
the
class
to
be
prepared
and
take
these
new
techniques
into
middle
school.
--In
addition,
my
computer
teacher
Mrs.
Borke
wanted
the
fifth
grade
to
get
acquainted
with
a
keyboard
so
we
would
be
ready
for
computer
classes
in
middle
school.
Every
week
we
had
typing
exercises
to
see
how
rapidly
and
accurately
we
typed.
I
absolutely
loathed
typing
class.
I
always
kept
my
eyes
on
the
keyboard
instead
of
the
screen,
which
resulted
in
low
speed
typing
scores.
As
I
spent
more
time
on
the
computer
I
became
more
acquainted
with
the
keyboard.
So,
when
it
came
time
to
take
keyboarding
in
seventh
grade
with
Mrs.
Fried
I
was
much
faster.
Both
Mrs.
Borke
and
Mrs.
Fried
emphasized
the
importance
of
computer
skills
as
well
as
being
able
to
type
quickly
and
correctly.
The
practice
I
had
in
those
classes
gave
me
the
confidence
and
ability
to
type
papers
(like
this
one)
with
ease.
I
continued
my
honors
English
classes
in
middle
school.
My
teachers:
Mrs.
Smithers,
Ms.
Wernock,
and
Mrs.
Hannan,
all
focused
on
vocabulary.
I
had
weekly
vocabulary
quizzes
with
words
like
insipid,
extraneous,
and
amicable.
My
papers
were
becoming
more
formal,
but
as
the
years
went
by
I
could
no
longer
depend
on
my
ideas
and
explanations
alone.
I
also
needed
facts
and
sources
in
my
papers.
Once
a
month,
my
class
was
taken
to
the
library
so
we
could
search
for
sources
to
put
in
our
papers.
The
librarian
taught
us
how
to
determine
if
a
source
was
credible,
primary
or
secondary,
as
well
as
how
to
integrate
them
into
a
paper.
I
remember
spending
hours
combing
through
databases
trying
to
find
articles
and
criticisms
to
support
my
paperOs
purpose.
In
sixth
grade,
Mrs.
Smithers
assigned
essays
that
would
reflect
on
the
stories
we
were
reading
in
class.
Conversely,
my
eighth
grade
teacher
Mrs.
Hannan
wanted
structured
essays
that
incorporated
credible
sources
through
out
our
papers.
Mrs.
Hannan
also
taught
me
the
basic
cookie
cutter
version
of
an
essay.
The
essay
had
to
have
an
introduction,
three
body
paragraphs,
and
a
conclusion.
The
skills
I
learned
in
my
middle
school
English
classes
were
taken
to
the
next
level
in
high
school.
In
my
sixth
grade
honors
English
class,
my
teacher
Mrs.
Balletti
took
Mrs.
HannanOs
cookie
cutter
essay
and
transformed
it
into
what
she
calls
the
N
Balletti
Burger.O
Her
NburgerO
was
a
metaphor
for
the
structure
of
each
paragraph.
Each
paragraph
had
layers
just
like
a
burger,
but
instead
of
lettuce
there
were
transition
sentences.
The
introductory
paragraph
needed
a
hook
sentence
to
grab
the
readerOs
attention,
transition
sentence,
brief
description
of
the
essay,
and
then
the
thesis
statement.
Each
body
paragraph
needed
a
topic
sentence,
transition
sentence,
explanation,
quote,
analysis,
and
then
a
conclusion
sentence.
The
conclusion
paragraph
summarized
the
entire
essay,
mentions
the
thesis,
and
the
last
sentence
should
be
thought
provoking.
This
NburgerO
helped
me
transition
from
thought
to
thought
and
organize
my
ideas
in
a
fluent
manner,
especially
when
I
had
to
write
research
papers.
In
high
school,
not
only
did
I
have
to
write
papers
for
English
but
I
also
had
to
write
papers
for
science
and
history.
The
NBalletti
BurgerO
could
be
applied
to
every
subject.
English
papers
had
structure
and
creativity.
History
papers
needed
to
be
organized,
accurate,
and
packed
with
information.
Science
papers
or
lab
reports
were
analytical
and
needed
to
follow
a
certain
format.
The
purpose
of
Mrs.
BallettiOs
NburgerO
was
to
develop
each
paragraph
so
information
and
ideas
flowed
smoothly.
With
Mrs.
BallettiOs
foundation,
my
tenth
grade
teacher
Ms.
Massa
wanted
essays
that
were
centered
on
original,
well-developed
ideas.
She
wanted
the
class
to
focus
more
on
thinking
outside
of
the
box
and
expected
a
blend
of
creativity
and
analysis.
In
addition,
Ms.
Massa
wanted
the
class
to
incorporate
literary
devices
such
as
personification
and
metaphors
in
our
writing
to
help
us
illustrate
our
thoughts
more
clearly.
Whenever
I
handed
in
a
paper,
she
would
write
Npunch
upO
on
it.
This
meant
that
she
wanted
me
to
Npunch
upO
the
diction
in
my
essay.
So
instead
of
saying
NI
threw
the
bird
food
on
the
groundO
she
would
want
me
to
write
something
like
NI
sprinkled
the
bird
food
across
the
ground.O
This
kind
of
language
put
a
better
picture
in
the
readerOs
mind.
Furthermore,
Ms.
Massa
also
taught
us
MLA
format
and
expected
every
paper
to
be
formatted
correctly.
Unfortunately,
Ms.
Massa
was
a
bit
eccentric
and
scared
half
the
class
out
of
eleventh
grade
honors
with
her
odd
manner
of
teaching.
I
had
one
of
my
worst
writing
experiences
in
her
class.
This
was
the
last
honors
English
class
I
took.
Nonetheless,
the
skills
I
learned
in
my
honors
classes
like
MLA
format
and
the
NBalletti
BurgerO
helped
me
write
papers
for
other
subjects
as
well
as
the
subjects
to
come.
In
eleventh
grade,
my
English
class
focused
on
preparing
everyone
for
the
SATs
and
writing
college
admission
essays.
My
SAT
preparation
consisted
of
weekly
quizzes
that
tested
reading
comprehension
and
vocabulary.
My
class
also
had
pop-quiz
essays,
which
was
exceedingly
difficult
for
me.
I
could
not
develop
and
organize
my
thoughts
quick
enough
to
produce
the
kind
of
work
I
wanted.
After
months
of
practice
I
got
better.
But
to
this
day,
I
still
need
a
lot
of
time
to
write
essays
IOm
happy
with.
Ms.
Murphy,
my
teacher
at
the
time,
also
wanted
her
class
to
find
our
voice
and
create
our
own
style
of
writing.
She
wanted
us
to
make
a
personal
connection
with
the
reader
in
our
college
admission
essays
by
letting
our
personality
shine
through
our
papers.
In
eleventh
grade,
I
focused
all
my
energy
on
getting
into
a
good
college
and
all
of
the
things
I
could
do
to
get
there.
Twelfth
grade,
on
the
other
hand,
was
all
about
being
prepared
for
college
once
I
got
there.
Ms.
Massa,
who
was
my
teacher
again
for
twelfth
grade,
once
again
demanded
creativity.
She
wanted
the
class
to
be
challenged
and
inspired
to
think
of
original
ideas.
Since
Ms.
Massa
was
my
teacher
two
years
ago,
I
knew
what
she
expected
of
me.
I
had
to
write
what
seemed
like
hundreds
of
two
page
reflection
essays
based
on
the
books
or
discussions
in
class.
She
wanted
the
class
to
get
away
from
Nbook
reportO
style
writing.
These
papers
were
fairly
easy
for
me
because
I
take
very
strong
stances
in
my
papers.
My
bold,
outspoken
opinions
helped
me
excel
in
that
class.
I
donOt
think
I
was
completely
prepared
for
college.
The
papers
I
was
writing
my
senior
year
were
two
pages
long
so
I
thought
in
a
very
concise
manner
in
order
to
obey
that
length.
When
I
came
to
college,
writing
papers
that
were
eleven
or
twelve
pages
long
was
incredibly
taxing.
I
had
a
lot
of
trouble
expanding
my
ideas
without
getting
off
topic.
I
had
to
create
outlines
for
my
brainstorming
and
depend
on
peer
input
and
revision.
I
began
to
rely
too
much
on
others
for
their
input
in
order
to
develop
my
ideas.
College
forced
me
to
be
more
independent
and
spend
more
time
brainstorming
and
organizing
my
ideas.
My
worst
writing
experience
was
in
tenth
grade.
Ms.
Massa
wanted
the
class
to
read
a
book,
give
a
speech,
and
make
a
presentation
about
it.
My
friend
Emily
and
I
were
partners
and
spent
thirteen
hours
on
our
project.
We
recreated
four
scenes
from
the
book,
including
a
carnival
scene
with
a
working
Ferris
wheel,
to
present
to
the
class.
To
sum
up,
everyone
else
in
the
class
brought
in
a
poster
and
got
the
same
grade
as
us.
Turns
out,
the
project
was
only
worth
twenty
points,
which
my
eccentric
teacher
Ms.
Massa
neglected
to
tell
us
until
the
day
it
was
due.
She
gave
the
class
a
little
speech
about
how
funny
it
was
that
Emily
and
I
put
so
much
effort
into
our
project
and
had
a
good
laugh
at
our
expense.
Even
though
Emily
and
I
received
an
A
on
our
project,
we
were
extremely
embarrassed.
The
best
writing
experience
I
had
was
in
seventh
grade.
My
history
teacher
Mrs.
Dekmar
wanted
the
class
to
write
and
present
a
speech
about
the
first
American
colonists.
At
thirteen
years
old,
I
made
a
forty-five
minute
speech
with
a
PowerPoint
presentation
and
received
an
A.
I
have
never
been
that
proud
of
myself
before.
My
teacher
was
so
impressed
by
all
of
the
information
I
gathered,
she
wanted
to
use
some
of
it
for
her
graduate
work.
So,
I
signed
a
waver
and
in
doing
so
became
teacherOs
pet.
I
tend
to
do
well
on
speeches
because
I
take
such
a
strong
stance
on
issues.
I
am
an
excellent
persuasive
writer
therefore
itOs
easy
for
me
to
convince
others
to
think
the
way
I
think.
Also,
IOm
very
self-conscious
when
it
comes
to
speeches.
As
a
result,
I
spend
enormous
amounts
of
time
trying
to
perfect
them
and
determine
how
to
fluctuate
my
voice
when
IOm
giving
the
speech.
This
wasnOt
the
best
speech
I
ever
gave,
but
it
was
the
first
of
many
I
was
pleased
with.
My
writing
experience
started
with
macaroni
when
I
was
in
preschool
and
I
am
continuing
it
now
with
my
Macintosh
laptop,
which
I
am
using
to
type
this
essay.
First,
I
learned
the
basic
building
blocks
of
writing
like
spelling,
grammar,
and
sentence
structure.
Then
I
learned
about
the
writing
process,
essay
structure,
sources,
and
how
to
manipulate
my
writing
for
every
subject.
Next,
I
learned
format,
organization,
and
how
to
analyze.
During
my
writing
journey
I
have
discovered
my
strengths
and
weaknesses.
I
am
persuasive,
concise,
and
creative;
however,
I
have
trouble
preventing
tangents
and
being
analytical.
I
can
fix
these
problems
by
organizing
my
thoughts
and
spending
more
time
on
my
outlines.
I
have
learned
so
much
and
I
am
excited
to
share
what
I
know
with
next
yearOs
freshmen.
Being
a
Writing
Assistant
would
allow
me
to
help
the
incoming
freshmen
with
their
writing
journey.
