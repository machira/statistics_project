Where
would
I
be
if
I
never
wrote
anything
down?
Could
I
possibly
claim
that
I
know
myself
if
I
could
never
reread
my
thoughts
from
the
past?
Most
individuals
have
specific
recolections
concerning
important
events
in
one's
life.
I
recall
painting
in
my
kindergarten
class,
playing
kickball
during
recess
at
elementary
school,
and
breaking
my
foot
in
junior
high.
Although
these
events
are
still
vivid
in
my
memory,
my
emotions
and
thoughts
concerning
many
significant,
as
well
as
insignificant
situations
are
long
forgotton.
I
recently
went
digging
and
exploring
through
the
many
boxes
and
notebooks
of
old
writing
samples
which
have
accumilated
through
the
years.
While
reading
through
these
samples
I
realized
that
my
thoughts
were
not
lost
in
time,
rather
my
thoughts
were
sustained
as
written
words.
My
concerns
and
thoughts
lived
on
vibrantly
through
these
various
writing
samples.
Sifting
through
these
writing
samples
has
given
me
a
new
perspective
on
childhood.
Rereading
my
writing
has
shown
me
the
great
influence
which
my
childhood
enviornment
has
had
upon
forming
my
values
system.
Furthermore,
I
now
have
authentic
documentation
that
my
strange
personality
existed
even
as
a
child.
The
pursuit
for
perfect
cursive
handwriting
is
one
my
earliest
memories
of
the
writing
process.
For
some
unexplained
reason,
to
be
able
to
write
in
script
was
deemed
a
majestic
achievement.
My
teachers
would
enforce
strict
cursive
writing
programs;
proper
placement
of
loops
and
curves
was
necessary
for
success
during
this
regulated
act.
If
you
didn't
have
the
proper
equipment,
such
as
a
Husky
pencil
and
extreamly
wide
ruled
notebook,
than
survival
through
this
learning
process
was
unlikely.
The
irony
of
learning
to
write
script
surrounds
its
use.
Other
than
the
few
book
reports
that
I
was
required
to
write
in
script,
I
would
always
simply
print
my
writing.
Once
I
entered
junior
high,
I
completed
all
writing
assignments
using
a
computer.
Even
when
I
accomplished
mindless
tasks
of
writing
notes
or
making
lists,
I
would
always
use
print
handwriting.
The
infrequency
with
which
I
actually
utilized
cursive
forces
me
to
question
the
rigorous
cursive
writing
program
which
compleated.
Considering
that
I
have
found
success
and
hapiness
in
this
world
without
employing
cursive
handwriting,
I
question
the
importance
of
learning
that
skill.
After
developing
an
understanding
of
words
and
the
organization
of
a
sentance,
my
elementary
school
teachers
thrusted
my
classmates
and
I
into
the
endless
world
of
essay
writing.
The
class
would
be
given
a
topic
to
write
about,
and
utilizing
our
childlike
innocence
and
boundless
imagination
each
child
would
create
a
unique
essay.
I
recall
one
writing
topic
which
required
me
to
formulate
the
perfect
day.
In
this
essay
I
fanticized
about
a
day
when
everything
turned
into
ice
cream.
The
hills,
buildings
and
everything
else
was
transformed
into
mountains
of
this
popular
dessert.
This
fantasy
didn't
seem
so
strange
at
the
time,
but
oddly
enough
I
don't
even
enjoy
ice
cream.
Other
memories
of
this
early
writing
process
occured
in
Mrs.
Goodman's
third
grade
class.
I
recall
many
writing
assignments,
however
one
situation
remains
more
vivid
than
the
others.
Following
a
writing
exercise,
Mrs.
Goodman
offered
me
constructive
criticism
about
my
writing,
yet
at
the
time
I
did
not
understand
her
remarks.
According
to
Mrs.
Goodman,
I
had
a
tendency
to
conduct
a
one
sided
conversation
with
the
reader,
assuming
that
the
reader
would
understand
my
thought
process.
Unlike
a
story
which
includes
dialogue
between
characters
within
the
story,
I
would
actually
converse
with
the
reader
throughout
the
essay.
It
seems
strange
to
think
that
I
used
to
construct
essays
in
this
manner,
however
the
writing
process
is
a
natural
progression
from
speech.
I
learned
to
speak
and
converse
much
earlier
than
I
learned
to
read
and
write.
Yet
unfortunately
in
my
early
days
as
a
writer
I
confused
the
ability
to
write
one's
thoughts
with
the
opportunity
to
converse
them.
My
later
years
in
elementary
school
were
filled
with
the
typical
book
reports.
I
would
read
the
book,
and
would
write
a
summary,
concluding
the
summary
with
my
opinion
of
the
story.
One
of
the
book
reports
which
I
wrote
when
I
was
ten
years
old
concludes,
"The
book
is
very
good.
I
liked
the
whole
thing.
It
was
exciting
and
enjoyable.
There's
nothing
in
the
book
I
didn't
like.
I
think
anyone
would
enjoy
this
book.
The
book
would
put
a
smile
on
your
face
if
you
read
it."
This
conclusion
was
very
common
for
me
during
this
stage
of
writing.
Yet
I
do
recall
the
teacher
asking
the
class
to
explain
and
substantiate
what
elements
of
the
book
that
we
liked
or
disliked.
At
the
time,
I
would
have
strengthened
my
opinion
by
stating
it
three
or
four
different
ways,
such
as
I
did
in
the
above
excerpt.
Not
until
my
understanding
of
the
writing
process
matured
did
I
begin
to
understand
that
to
validate
my
opinion
I
must
support
it
with
example
or
fact.
Furthermore
I
have
developed
great
simpathy
for
my
teachers
who
had
to
read
and
evaluate
these
attempts
at
writing.
Not
only
are
these
wrting
samples
boring,
dull,
and
lack
creativilty,
but
they
are
filled
with
aggrivating
grammar
mistakes.
One
of
the
most
enlightening
writing
experinces
is
journal
writing.
When
I
was
required
by
my
seventh
grade
teacher
to
keep
a
jounal
I
didn't
realize
what
an
important
document
that
journal
would
become
in
the
future.
However
when
I
reread
my
thoughts
it
allows
me
to
remember
simple
elements
of
childhood
which
would
be
impossible
to
trigger
otherwise.
Old
friends,
events
and
emotions
are
captured
in
the
old
hot
pink
spiral
notebook
which
was
last
used
in
1987.
The
last
journal
entry
which
my
teacher
required
the
class
to
write
was
an
evaluation
of
the
journal
writing
experience.
My
summation
of
the
journal
writing
experience:
"I
really
don't
enjoy
writing
journal
entries.
They
are
so
boring.
They
don't
really
teach
me
anything
because
there
is
nothing
to
learn
from
them.
I
feel
that
they
are
a
waste
of
time."
Unfortunately
in
seventh
grade
I
underestimated
the
importance
of
writing
journal
entries.
Reading
through
my
journal
entries
triggered
memories
of
how
committed
I
was
to
change
the
world,
and
how
simpathetic
I
was
to
the
cause
of
the
needy.
One
particular
entry
discusses
the
problems
of
the
homeless,
and
to
erradicate
the
problem
I
cite
the
credentials
of
Donald
Trump.
Trump
wasn't
just
a
symbol
of
extreame
wealth
and
high
society,
rather
I
admired
him
"because
of
his
influence
on
society."
Although
I
haven't
lost
my
compassion
for
current
social
problems,
my
recent
focus
has
been
diverted
at
college.
It
is
remarkable
to
be
able
to
acknowledge
the
notions
of
innocence
and
invincability
which
I
once
expressed
in
through
these
entries.
Without
these
written
documents
I
would
not
have
the
ability
to
compare
my
old
goals
and
ambitions
with
my
current
hopes
for
the
future.
Learning
to
be
a
good
writer
is
a
cumulative
process,
and
the
constant
education
of
grammar
skills
reinforces
this
continuous
learning
process.
My
grammar
education
began
as
early
as
I
began
writing
sentances,
so
why
aren't
I
a
grammar
expert?
For
almost
fifteen
years
teachers
have
been
attempting
to
teach
grammar
to
me,
yet
I
still
couldn't
describe
an
adverb,
except
for
the
fact
that
an
adverb
will
usually
end
with
ly
.
Without
fail,
every
single
english
class
from
elementary
through
high
school
would
instruct
the
class
about
grammar,
yet
I
still
get
confused
with
apostrophe
rules.
I
am
pleased
to
notice
considerable
improvements
in
my
understanding
of
grammar
rules;
I
suppose
the
fifteen
years
of
grammar
education
is
finally
paying
off.
The
most
substantial
writing
experience
occurred
in
my
tenth
grade
english
class
under
the
helm
of
Mr.
Clark.
Mr.
Clark
was
renouned
for
difficult
grading
techniques
with
very
positive
learning
experiences
as
outcomes.
Clark
required
a
few
simple
grammar
rules
to
be
strictly
followed.
Some
of
these
rules
were
to
never
switch
tenses
through
your
paper,
and
to
always
follow
the
word
this
with
a
noun
or
pronoun.
If
you
failed
to
follow
these
rules
then
your
paper
was
given
an
automatic
F,
regardless
of
the
content
or
quality
of
the
rest
of
the
assignment.
I
must
admitt
that
I
did
have
a
small
problem
with
switching
tenses
which
was
quickly
answered
with
a
failing
grade
on
a
paper.
Clark's
rules
appeared
cruel,
however
he
made
you
take
a
very
close
look
at
every
word
that
you
include
in
an
assignment.
I
learned
to
evaluate
details
of
my
writing
which
I
had
never
been
very
concerned
with
previously.
My
most
recent
writing
experiences
have
proved
to
be
rewarding,
challenging
and
exciting.
College
has
offered
me
the
opportunity
to
analyze
and
interpret
literature
and
theory
while
developing
a
better
understanding
of
myself.
Not
all
of
my
writing
experiences
have
been
successful
at
Lafayette,
however
the
more
I
write,
the
more
interested
I
am
in
improving
my
writing
style.
Often
I
will
read
through
papers
written
my
freshman
or
sophomore
year
and
I
amaze
myself
with
the
quality
and
unique
thoughts
which
are
developed
in
these
papers.
Time
can
be
captured
in
photographs,
paintings
and
words.
All
of
these
forms
of
art
allow
an
individual
to
relive
moments
and
emotions.
Only
the
written
word
can
express
the
emotions
of
the
moment.
Written
documents
give
you
the
opportunity
to
relive
moments,
curse
reality
or
fantasize
about
the
ideal.
Recently
I
have
developed
an
understanding
of
the
power
of
writing.
If
I
could
only
turn
back
the
clock
and
make
my
seventh
grade
journal
even
more
powerful.
