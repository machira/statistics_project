The
Portrait
of
as
a
Young
Man
The
written
word
is
without
a
doubt
mankindes
greatest
creation.
The
modern
poet
shares
quite
the
similar
sentiment
with
the
primal
cave
dweller
who,
grasping
a
mass
of
clay
and
gazing
intently
at
the
blank
wall
of
slate,
experienced
the
very
first
writeres
block.
The
Marquis
de
Sade
certainly
shared
this
frustration.
With
his
sweat,
blood
and
fecal
matter,
he
scrawled
upon
his
prison
walls
the
very
passion
of
the
human
heart.
It
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
words
are
the
breath
of
the
collective
human
consciousness,
an
inhalation
and
exhalation
of
poetry
and
politics
that
effuses
life
into
our
history.
Like
the
evolution
of
written
expression
across
the
ages,
my
own
writing
matured
and
developed
via
various
tools
and
mediums.
Like
most
other
toddlers
I
began
to
acquire
my
cognitive
skills
in
kindergarten.
Iem
sure
many
enjoyed
these
halcyon
days
of
naptimes
and
juice
boxes.
But
my
mother,
no
doubt
embittered
by
thirty
hours
of
labor
and
a
subsequent
cesarean
section,
saw
fit
to
send
me
to
Catholic
school.
My
classroom,
devoid
of
juice
and
pastels,
was
lorded
by
a
fierce,
Trunchbull-esque
nun
who
despite
her
advanced
years
retained
an
unbridled
ferocity
of
discipline.
Years
of
sexual
frustration
on
the
streets
of
Calcutta
instilled
within
her
heart
a
zealous
vengeance
which
she
more
than
happily
wreaked
upon
her
jeune
etudiants.
So
it
was
with
remarkable
alacrity
that
we
learned
our
alphabet
as
well
as
the
Lordes
Prayer,
for
we
all
feared
the
whip
of
her
glare
and
the
gritty
fire
in
her
voice.
Our
brief
respite
during
the
day
was
naptime,
which
was
usually
restless
and
conducted
with
one
eye
open.
My
hands
were
constantly
stained
with
colored
wax
as
I
continually
clutched
a
crayon
close
to
my
heart
for
protection.
Apart
from
warding
off
evil,
Crayola
served
a
variety
of
other
functions.
Ieve
always
liked
to
think
of
it
as
my
beginneres
pen.
The
crayon
is
quite
an
appropriate
reflection
for
a
childes
thoughts
a
crude
yet
bright,
simple
yet
imaginative.
I
often
wonder
if
we
shouldnet
reintroduce
this
implement
to
adults
who
only
think
in
terms
of
black
ink,
for
who
can
help
but
smile
when
they
see
that
colorful
scrawl?
Replacing
Kenneth
Layes
Montblanc
with
a
bright
red
Crayola
might
have
recalled
to
him
happier
visions
of
childhood.
A
childes
voice
speaks
in
his
mind,
vYou
wanted
to
be
a
fireman,
not
an
asshole.
Remember?g
And
that
mendacious
old
Scrooge
would
have
thrown
open
the
shutters
and
welcomed
the
new
day,
living
a
long,
happy
life
with
Tiny
Tim,
who
is
played
by
Haley
Joel
Osment
in
the
inevitable
Lifetime
movie.
Much
like
the
infant
Lay,
I
too
took
my
literary
baby
steps
with
the
crayon.
My
scribbling
usually
took
the
form
of
a
badly
drawn
picture
and
inane
labels
such
as,
vMommyg,
vPopg,
or
vappleg,
which
may
or
may
not
have
been
listed
in
my
order
of
preference.
Despite
their
poor
quality,
my
parents
rewarded
my
botched
efforts
at
artistry
by
placing
each
creation
on
the
refrigerator
door.
To
this
day
a
ragged
artifact
still
clings
to
its
stainless
steel
surface,
an
abstract
sunflower
proclaiming
in
a
speech
bubble,
vI
love
my
mommy!g
I
still
remember
the
day
I
drew
it
a
that
cantankerous
old
nun
was
kind
enough
to
remind
me
that
flowers
do
not
have
mothers,
nor
souls,
and
if
I
was
ever
to
encounter
a
pansy
gifted
with
speech
I
could
be
sure
it
was
the
devil
trying
to
subject
me
to
temptation.
In
retrospect
Ied
have
to
disagree
with
her.
In
my
experience,
ites
the
quiet
pansies
that
cause
trouble.
Although
kindergarten
was
monstrous
and
I
longed
for
the
summer,
I
also
dreaded
my
ascension
into
the
first
grade.
I
couldnet
even
imagine
the
horrors
that
awaited
me
a
Chinese
water
torture,
the
Iron
Maiden,
math.
Thankfully
the
times
were
in
my
favor
a
I
was
raised
in
an
age
where
Julie
Andrews
had
been
the
youngest
convent
candidate
alive,
who
fashionably
exchanging
her
rosary
for
a
rich
Vienna
Captain.
Soon
after,
Madonna
and
materialism
had
chewed
up,
consumed,
and
partially
regurgitated
those
antiquated
vows
of
poverty
and
chastity.
Not
even
Whoopi
Goldberg
could
get
women
back
in
the
habit.
After
an
extensive
mining
operation,
the
Church
realized
it
had
extracted
the
last
of
its
fossils,
scraping
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
in
a
futile
yet
admirable
attempt
to
replenish
its
schools
with
ruler-wielding
edifiers.
Faced
with
either
extinction
or
modernization
it
chose
the
latter
of
the
two,
begrudgingly
tossing
a
few
fresh
vegetables
into
its
cold
meat
stew.
And
thus
I
found
myself
with
Ms.
Carmine,
who
was
a
refreshing
dash
of
oregano
after
my
first
mouthful
of
tough
mutton.
Her
youth
and
possibly
secular
upbringing
were
a
breath
of
fresh
air
across
a
stagnant
pool,
bringing
with
it
a
stream
of
creative
juices.
I
put
my
crayon
to
good
use
that
year,
coloring
the
sets
for
different
biblical
tales.
Vividly
I
recall
my
eponymous
role
in,
vDaniel
in
the
Liones
Den,g
for
which
I
was
also
my
own
scriptwriter.
Lines
such
as
vDonet
eat
me!g
and
vThanks,
God!g
sprinkled
this
cupcake
of
a
parable
play.
The
moral,
though
I
wrote
it
in
the
very
infancy
of
my
writing
career,
still
rings
true,
vPray
to
Jesus
or
the
lions
will
eat
you.g
Like
the
tracings
in
a
DeNealian
handwriting
book,
my
memories
of
youth
are
sketchy
at
best.
I
remember
random
assignments
a
a
show
and
tell
summary
of
an
18th
century
cannonball
retrieved
from
my
front
yard,
a
presentation
on
good
oral
hygiene,
and
a
book
report
on
James
and
the
Giant
Peach
were
just
a
few
of
the
highlights.
Recently
I
discovered
a
short
response
question:
If
you
were
a
gift,
what
would
you
be
and
whom
would
you
give
it
to?
My
response
was:
If
I
was
a
gift
I
would
be
the
gift
of
life
and
I
would
give
it
to
my
cat
Sammy
who
just
died.
This
one
sentence
brought
back
a
flood
of
memories,
of
my
first
experience
with
death
and
my
first
attempt
to
impress
my
teacher
and
classmates
with
a
meaningful
yet
abstract
answer.
vYouell
shoot
your
eye
out,
kid,g
my
teacher
quipped.
The
elementary
school
years
melted
away
like
butter
in
a
microwave.
I
traded
my
crayon
in
for
a
graphite
pencil,
working
my
way
from
No.
10
to
No.
2.
After
winning
a
spelling
bee
in
5th
grade
I
considered
retiring
at
the
top
of
my
game.
But
then
the
unthinkable
happened.
Nearing
the
end
of
the
school
year,
our
teacher
gave
us
one
last
assignment
for
the
class,
a
one-page
summary
of
Maniac
Magee.
For
the
uninformed,
Maniac
Magee
is
the
Newbury
award-winning
story
of
a
young
boy
who
manages
to
overcome
a
townes
racial
tensions
by
capturing
the
hearts
of
everyone
he
encounters.
His
innocence
and
intelligence
are
able
to
win
the
day
against
hatred
and
bias.
Little
did
I
know
my
own
encounter
with
prejudice
would
soon
await
me.
My
summary,
however
banal,
was
concise
and
accurate.
My
only
flaw
was
a
slight
error
in
judgment
a
I
made
the
mistake
of
including
the
word
vstuffg
in
my
synopsis.
Not
only
did
my
teacher
circle
this
word
several
times
with
red
ink,
she
also
reprimanded
my
diction
with
a
vfootnoteg
that
nearly
doubled
the
length
of
my
paper.
In
addition
she
felt
compelled
to
lecture
the
entire
class
on
appropriate
word
choices,
while
repeatedly
mentioning
the
abominable
literary
crimes
of
that
vcertain
student,g
though,
vshe
wouldnet
name
any
names.g
She
did
of
course
glare
at
me
often
enough
to
indicate
anonymity
wasnet
high
on
her
list
of
priorities.
In
the
end
she
gave
me
my
first
C,
and
that
awful
red
half-moon
is
still
seared
upon
my
mindes
eye.
Looking
back
I
realize
that
the
motive
for
her
actions
was
not
a
violation
of
literary
sensibility
but
rather
something
much
more
insidious.
She
was,
like
many
teachers
Ieve
encountered,
prejudiced
against
bad
handwriting.
I
first
achieved
some
literary
renown
in
middle
school
after
writing
a
song
about
the
Civil
War.
My
efforts
were
met
with
standing
ovation,
and
my
teacher
even
rewarded
my
efforts
with
a
vMedal
of
Honorg,
a
prize
given
to
those
who
risk
life
in
battle
and/or
make
a
cool
project
about
Johnny
Tremain.
It
was
clear
I
had
a
gift.
From
then
on
I
looked
forward
to
every
school
project
with
poetry
and
my
efforts
were
always
met
with
enthusiasm
from
my
teachers
and
peers.
Once
I
even
forgot
all
the
basic
requirements
for
an
assignment,
but
my
teacher
enjoyed
my
poem
so
much
she
still
gave
me
an
A+.
At
the
end
of
8th
grade,
a
new
category
of
vLiterary
excellenceg
was
created
for
the
specific
purpose
of
giving
me
an
award.
I
was
that
cool.
High
school
began
a
new
era
of
exploration.
I
wrote
several
more
songs
for
class
projects.
One
in
particular,
themed
America
sparked
some
controversy,
vForget
the
birds
and
bees,
and
stick
to
hugging
trees
/
You
canet
have
sex
without
spreading
some
disease.g
A
research
paper
on
Allen
Ginsberg
more
than
likely
fueled
these
rebellious
couplets.
I
remember
reading,
vPlease,
Masterg
for
the
first
time,
and
those
words!
I
didnet
know
you
were
allowed
to
write
those
words
down.
I
didnet
even
know
what
some
of
those
words
meant,
I
had
never
seen
anything
like
them
before.
The
audacity,
the
sheer
lack
of
innuendo
both
disgusted
and
amazed
me.
For
lack
of
a
better
term
I
was
inspired.
My
next
research
paperes
title
was,
vA
Whale
of
a
Tale:
Herman
Melville
and
Homoeroticism.g
My
inner
nun
was
scolding
me,
and
I
realized
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
had
found
a
talking
pansy.
And
I
absolutely
adored
it.
As
high
school
continued
I
became
progressively
more
involved
with
the
literary
magazine.
From
the
beginning
my
enthusiasm
for
poetry
helped
me
stand
out,
and
by
junior
year
I
had
earned
the
position
of
assistant
editor.
That
year
was
critical
to
my
growth
as
a
writer,
and
in
a
large
part
I
owe
this
to
my
British
Literature
teacher,
Ms.
Porrazzo.
Her
excellence
stemmed
not
from
her
kindness
for
she
had
none,
nor
from
her
patience
because
it
had
all
been
spent.
The
true
core
of
her
success
was
her
quality
of
relationship
with
her
students,
a
kind
of
tough
love.
She
only
had
the
highest
of
expectations
for
her
pupils
and
she
wreaked
a
terrible
fury
on
anyone
who
vdallied
in
their
studiesg
and
vwasted
her
timeg.
She
was
always
one
to
speak
her
mind.
I
remember
on
the
first
day
of
class
the
words
vAmerican
Literatureg
written
on
the
blackboard.
vThis
phrase,g
she
said,
vis
my
favorite
oxymoron.g
With
the
help
of
Ms.
Porrazzo
I
was
able
to
refine
my
expository
writing.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
actually
paid
attention
to
that
red
pen
in
the
margin
of
my
papers
-
she
actually
knew
what
she
was
talking
about!
The
weeks
passed,
and
the
pressure
to
perform
mounted
as
the
AP
English
test
quickly
approached.
But
interspersed
between
the
practice
tests
and
essays
was
a
wealth
of
valuable
information.
Beowulf,
Coleridge,
and
Macbeth
were
among
the
more
famous
visitors
to
our
class.
I
realize
now
that
her
chalkboard
challenge
had
been
the
thesis
statement
to
her
class,
and
her
argument
consisted
of
a
number
of
examples
that
consistently
proved
her
point
a
Stowe
couldnet
hold
a
candle
to
Shakespeare.
And
the
conclusion
to
her
essay
was
a
major
assignment,
not
a
Newbury
summary
but
rather
a
Final
Portfolio
in
which,
much
like
this
essay,
I
evaluated
my
experiences
in
life
thus
far
and
predicted
my
future.
Among
the
many
papers
I
included
were
a
few
poems
and
an
essay,
a
short
piece
that
interpreted
a
line
from
a
book
of
my
choice.
I
chose,
vI
feel
infinite,g
from
The
Perks
of
Being
a
Wallflower
by
Stephen
Chbosky.
This
statement
really
spoke
to
me;
I,
like
the
narrator,
was
a
lump
of
clay
who
realized
for
the
first
time
that
it
could
be
molded
into
something
greater.
For
my
portfolio
I
earned
a
B+,
and
I
subsequently
achieved
a
5
on
the
AP
exam.
By
senior
year
I
had
risen
to
the
level
of
Editor
of
the
schoolees
magazine,
Writings
on
the
Wall.
Unfortunately
for
my
organization,
the
last
few
years
showed
a
decline
in
attendance
and
a
strange
variation
in
demographics.
The
bright
artistic
intellectuals
who
had
first
attracted
me
to
the
group
had
been
replaced
by
a
coven
of
witches,
total
The
Craft
wannabes.
Their
spells
and
hexes
flooded
the
magazinees
submissions
folder
submitted
under
ostensible
pen
names
such
as
vLunag
or
vArcher
Daventryg.
Each
meeting
they
discussed
Robert
Jordan
novels
over
tarot
cards
and
pop
tarts
while
I
fought
valiantly
to
keep
the
focus
on
relevant
topics.
The
burden
of
publication
ultimately
fell
on
me
and
my
art
editor.
Each
evening
we
would
sort
through
the
piles
of
prose
and
art,
searching
for
small
literary
gems
amidst
the
demon-worshipping
drivel.
Eventually
we
managed
to
scrape
together
enough
material
for
a
finished
product,
and
the
compilation
was
completed
by
Prom.
We
christened
our
love
child,
vPrimary
Colorsg.
I
had
the
honor
of
writing
the
introduction,
vJust
as
the
combination
of
the
three
primary
colors
creates
every
other
color,
the
compilation
of
our
studentse
art
defines
its
student
body.
And
thus
we
see
the
whole
picture.g
Despite
the
numerous
anathemas
from
the
coven,
the
magazine
turned
out
beautifully,
so
much
so
in
fact
the
school
awarded
us
for
our
efforts
with
a
plaque
at
the
senior
award
ceremony.
Apart
from
my
school-affiliated
activities,
I
was
also
heavily
involved
with
a
church
retreat
program
called
Antioch.
As
a
member
of
the
vteamg,
it
was
my
responsibility
each
retreat
to
give
a
vtalkg,
a
speech
embodying
a
difficult
moral
or
spiritual
trouble
in
my
life.
I
believe
that
these
speeches
were
absolutely
essential
to
my
writing
process.
Not
only
did
I
have
to
write
for
myself
I
also
had
to
write
for
others,
delivering
a
higher
message
of
faith,
hope
and
understanding.
And
one
year,
it
seemed
God
intended
a
greater
purpose
for
me.
My
speech
assignment
was
vMasksg
a
the
illusions
shown
to
the
public
that
disguises
a
true
identity.
Despite
my
better
judgment,
I
used
this
speech
as
an
opportunity
to
come
out
as
a
homosexual
to
the
combined
clergy
and
youth
of
my
parish.
I
had
never
told
anyone
before,
so
naturally
I
was
very
curious
to
the
reactions
of
the
audience.
To
my
utter
surprise,
the
entire
room
burst
into
applause
and
cheers
by
my
conclusion
and
I
was
embraced
by
everyone
in
the
room.
I
had
learned
the
importance
of
truth
in
writing,
and
the
importance
of
tailoring
truth
in
such
a
fashion
as
to
win
over
the
audience.
My
great
love
of
literature
and
my
experiences
up
until
this
point
shaped
my
desire
to
become
an
English
major.
Up
until
recently
I
also
expected
to
minor
in
Business
and
Economics,
but
after
speaking
with
my
advisor
and
hearing
George
Saunders
speak
last
year
I
changed
my
mind.
I
always
used
to
say,
vWell,
at
least
Iell
have
my
Business
minor
to
fall
back
on.g
But
a
half-hearted
dedication
to
English
unsettles
me
now.
There
is
something
about
the
business
world
that
makes
people
so
boring,
a
v9-5
mentalityg
so
to
speak.
For
instance
my
parents
used
to
be
perfectly
interesting
people
before
work
sucked
the
life
out
of
them.
Writing
never
fades
or
grows
old,
and
in
fact
it
may
sharpen
with
time.
My
best
experience
at
Lafayette
so
far
has
been
with
my
Creative
Writing
class.
It
is
absolutely
exhilarating
to
hear
a
whole
classroom
full
of
people
discussing
my
work,
be
it
positive
or
negative
reviews.
Never
before
had
I
been
offered
this
perspective.
I
also
kept
a
few
journal
entries
during
this
class,
which
was
helpful.
Ieve
tried
a
few
journals
in
my
past
but
they
never
stuck,
and
this
one
was
no
exception.
Ieve
always
been
in
love
with
the
idea
of
one
but
Iem
not
sure
I
have
enough
commitment
to
converse
with
one
every
night.
Ieve
considering
writing
one
on
the
computer
like
Scully
from
the
X-Files
but
that
seems
too
impersonal
for
my
taste.
I
hope
my
time
as
a
Writing
Associate
will
rededicate
me
to
the
task.
After
reading
the
Bartholomae
piece,
I
feel
as
though
I
have
a
long
way
to
go
on
the
path
towards
becoming
an
experienced
writer.
If
and
when
I
do
reach
that
point,
I
will
be
sure
to
write
an
essay
detailing
the
flaws
of
everyone
elsees
writing.
But
for
now,
this
conclusion
will
have
to
suffice:
Writing
is
an
extremely
important
part
of
our
lives,
and
it
is
the
only
cure
I
know
of
for
illiteracy.
And
stuff
like
that.
