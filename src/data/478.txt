Writing
as
a
WA
I
have
learned
a
lot
about
the
writing
process
and
come
to
realizations
about
my
own
writing
through
my
experiences
as
a
WA.
There
are
the
obvious
things
that
IOm
sure
every
WA
realizes:
the
importance
of
my
revising
my
work,
and
managing
my
time
effectively
enough
so
that
I
am
able
to
do
so,
not
to
mention
many
other
things.
However,
the
most
valuable
thing
IOve
learned
is
how
to
approach
daunting
assignments
more
effectively,
and
how
to
appreciate
the
papers
that
really
force
me
to
flex
my
muscle
as
a
writer
rather
than
just
going
through
the
motions.
I
feel
like
IOve
gotten
the
same
English
paper
assignment
a
million
times:
Nwrite
a
X
to
Y
page
paper
about
novel
Z
on
the
topic
of
your
choice.O
ThatOs
it.
Often
the
professor
will
refer
the
class
back
to
the
general
paper-writing
guidelines
included
in
the
syllabus,
but
there
arenOt
any
guidelines
beyond
that.
Usually
IOll
beg
for
a
little
more
direction,
asking
the
professor
questions
like
Nwhat
kind
of
topic
do
you
want
us
to
select?O
After
all
(I
assume)
the
professor
must
have
some
expectations.
However,
these
questions
are
usually
fruitless
and
I
am
left
in
front
of
a
blank
computer
screen,
scratching
my
head
trying
to
figure
out
where
to
begin.
I
had
to
write
several
papers
like
this
for
my
American
Novel
class
first
semester
last
year.
One
of
our
assignments
was
Nwrite
a
5
to
7
page
paper
on
the
Scarlet
Letter.O
In
the
midst
of
writing
this
paper,
I
was
also
conducting
my
second
round
of
WA
conferences
with
the
FYS
class
I
was
working
with
for
the
semester.
My
Scarlet
Letter
assignment
and
the
writing
assignment
the
freshmen
had
been
given
were
like
night
and
day.
The
FYS
professor
had
given
me
the
assignment
to
look
over
before
meeting
with
the
students,
and
I
thought
I
had
it
straight.
The
assignment
(itself,
not
the
length
the
professor
wanted
the
paper
to
be)
was
one
and
a
half
pages,
single
spaced,
and
initially
I
thought
it
should
be
pretty
easy
since
the
guidelines
were
all
there:
all
the
students
had
to
do
was
follow
the
formula
set
forth
by
the
professor
and
theyOd
have
their
paper.
I
thought
these
assignments
virtually
wrote
themselves.
However,
upon
meeting
with
the
students,
I
found
the
assignment
to
be
far
more
complex
than
I
had
initially
suspected.
The
guidelines
were
not
proving
helpful
to
the
majority
of
students;
in
fact
they
were
quite
a
hindrance.
The
assignment
specified
that
the
students
were
to
use
a
certain
(exact)
number
of
each
of
three
different
types
of
sources,
and
that
it
had
to
be
five
pages
long,
give
or
take
Nten
percentO
(this
was
actually
written
in
the
assignment).
Not
only
were
the
students
having
difficulty
either
finding
enough
of
one
type
of
source,
and
narrowing
it
down
to
the
correct
number
of
another,
but
they
also
found
it
very
difficult
to
stick
to
the
very
precise
length
restrictions
(since
10
percent
of
5
pages
works
out
to
be
roughly
half
a
page,
the
range
in
length
had
to
be
from
4
?
to
5
?
pages).
Furthermore,
since
the
assignment
itself
was
so
long,
the
students
were
getting
lost
in
the
wording
(the
professor
had
written
a
rather
long
preamble
to
the
assignment
and
the
assignment
itself
didnOt
really
NstartO
until
about
half
way
down
the
first
page).
They
knew
how
long
it
had
to
be
and
how
many
sources
they
needed,
but
the
professor
had
essentially
over-explained
the
assignment,
thus
making
it
seem
more
complex
than
it
really
was,
so
the
students
were
unsure
of
what
they
needed
to
accomplish
in
their
papers.
The
professor
also
included
a
long
list
of
Nquestions
to
considerO
for
the
paper,
but
never
stated
whether
these
questions
needed
be
addressed
in
the
paper.
As
a
result
of
the
assignment
being
so
long
and
wordy
(and
further
attempts
on
my
part
to
clarify
the
assignment
with
the
professor,
or
have
him
explain
it
better
in
class
failed)
I
ended
up
spending
more
time
deciphering
the
assignment
with
the
students
than
actually
working
with
them
to
craft
a
well-written
paper.
After
this
experience
with
the
FYS
class,
I
find
myself
favoring
more
simple,
vague
assignments,
rather
than
ones
with
detailed
expectations
(thatOs
not
to
say
that
there
isnOt
some
happy
medium
between
the
two).
What
I
originally
found
appealing
about
the
FYS
assignment
proved
to
be
the
thing
I
(and
the
FYS
students)
most
disliked
about
it
when
all
was
said
and
done.
This
led
me
(and
leads
me
as
I
really
havenOt
thought
about
the
experience
in
depth
until
now)
to
think
that
when
assignments
are
so
detailed
and
have
such
strict
guidelines,
writers
often
find
themselves
focusing
more
on
those
guidelines
than
the
actual
content
of
their
papers.
Instead
of
wondering
if
each
point
he
or
she
makes
in
the
paper
helps
to
prove
the
thesis
or
if
the
argument
flows
logically,
the
writer
is
more
focused
on
whether
they
have
the
correct
number
of
sources
and
if
they
answer
every
question
that
the
professor
told
them
to
think
about
when
writing.
This
is
not
to
say
that
there
shouldnOt
be
guidelines
for
writing
papers,
but
I
think
when
professors
make
assignments
so
long
and
complex,
they
cause
the
student
to
worry
about
satisfying
too
many
conditions
when
the
primary
concern
should
merely
be
to
write
a
good
paper.
Interestingly
enough,
the
class
that
I
was
assigned
to
second
semester
was
the
polar
opposite
of
the
first.
The
differences
werenOt
limited
to
the
surface
details,
which
in
and
of
themselves
were
rather
striking:
I
was
working
with
Philosophy
class
of
upperclassmen
rather
than
a
science
focused
FYS.
The
most
crucial
difference
to
me
was
the
professorsO
approaches
to
writing
assignments,
which
could
not
have
been
more
different
(and
which
also,
much
to
my
amusement,
completely
adhered
to
my
stereotypes
of
how
scientists
and
philosophers
would
approach
writing
differently).
Rather
than
specific,
detailed
assignments
like
the
FYS
class,
the
Philosophy
class
was
simply
told
at
the
beginning
of
the
semester
that
they
were
to
write
a
total
of
twenty
pages
by
the
end
of
the
semester.
They
could
break
these
pages
up
however
they
wished,
writing
anywhere
from
one
to
four
papers
on
any
topic
they
discussed
in
class
or
covered
in
the
reading,
which
mostly
consisted
of
novels.
Despite
having
learned
what
I
did
through
my
experience
with
the
FYS
class,
I
have
to
admit
that
when
I
heard
how
much
leeway
the
professor
was
giving
the
class,
I
was
glad
that
I
wasnOt
taking
it
(originally
I
was
planning
on
taking
the
class)
because
I
couldnOt
imagine
having
literally
no
guidelines:
when
I
asked
the
professor
what
she
was
looking
for
in
the
papers,
she
simply
responded
Njust
that
theyOre
well-written
and
make
good
arguments.O
After
hearing
this
I
wasnOt
quite
sure
how
I
would
approach
the
conferences.
My
entire
experience
as
a
WA
had
been
the
previous
semester
(with
the
exception
of
drop-in)
when
all
I
did
was
go
over
the
assignment
and
whether
the
paper
adhered
to
the
conditions
set
forth
by
the
professor.
Now
I
had
no
assignment
to
cling
to;
no
page
and
half
long
set
of
guidelines
to
judge
the
papers
by.
The
conferences
second
semester
proved
to
be
far
easier
and
more
productive
than
the
ones
I
had
first
semester.
I
think
the
main
reason
was
that
since
we
did
not
have
to
spend
so
much
time
discussing
the
assignment,
we
could
focus
on
higher
order
concerns
like
organization,
thesis,
and
evidence
in
support
of
the
thesis.
These
conferences
were
also
far
less
structured
than
the
ones
I
had
first
semester:
there
was
no
agenda
of
things
that
I
felt
I
had
to
talk
with
the
students
about.
Furthermore,
I
never
felt
like
I
was
simply
telling
the
students
what
to
do
(which
was
how
I
sometimes
felt
first
semester);
it
was
more
of
an
even
exchange
of
ideas.
As
for
what
all
of
this
has
taught
me
about
my
own
writing,
I
think
I
have
come
to
like
more
vague
assignments
better
than
ones
with
detailed
expectations.
The
papers
I
read
for
the
FYS
class
were
all
very
similar:
I
felt
like
I
was
reading
the
same
thing
over
and
over.
Furthermore,
I
felt
like
the
assignment
was
more
of
a
high-school
one
(which
might
explain
why
it
was
given
to
an
FYS
class).
While
some
of
the
topics
of
the
Philosophy
papers
overlapped,
the
approaches
to
the
topics
were
all
different.
To
me,
having
to
painstakingly
think
about
every
aspect
of
writing
a
paper,
from
the
topic,
to
what
questions
should
be
answered
in
the
paper,
is
real
college
writing.
Both
types
of
assignments
have
their
disadvantages,
after
all,
writing
well
isnOt
supposed
to
be
easy.
The
assignments
that
I
call
Ntypical
English
papersO
are
difficult
to
get
started
on:
arriving
at
specific
topic
on
a
novel
as
complex
as
The
Scarlet
Letter
takes
time,
and
making
sure
that
the
topic
works
involves
a
lot
of
effort;
but
it
pays
off.
My
Scarlet
Letter
paper
ended
up
being
one
of
the
best,
most
provocative
papers
I
have
ever
written.
I
felt
like
my
thesis
was
my
own
(although
with
the
countless
essays
written
on
the
book,
IOm
sure
itOs
not
an
entirely
new
argument)
because
it
was
not
the
product
of
guidelines,
but
rather
of
my
understanding
of
the
novel.
While
I
have
not
really
written
any
papers
similar
to
the
FYS
class,
I
can
still
compare
them
to
my
own
experiences
as
a
writer
in
the
sense
that
guidelines
often
make
papers
more
difficult
to
write.
Although
it
seems
easy
at
first:
I
initially
like
having
all
the
guidelines
set
out
neatly
before
me,
once
I
really
get
into
writing
papers
of
this
sort,
I
find
them
to
be
more
boring
than
the
ones
with
fewer
guidelines.
Furthermore,
I
find
myself
focusing
too
much
on
the
guidelines,
constantly
referring
back
to
the
assignment
and
checking
off
each
requirement
as
it
is
fulfilled.
After
my
experiences
as
a
WA
I
am
definitely
more
conscious
of
this
fact.
I
wrote
quite
a
few
research
papers
last
year,
including
two
twenty
five
page
history
research
papers
and
one
fifteen
page
English
research
paper.
While
I
would
typically
associate
research
papers
more
with
the
FYS-type
of
assignment
than
the
Philosophy
one,
these
research
papers,
especially
the
English
one,
were
different.
There
were
guidelines
on
length,
type
of
citations,
and
number
of
sources,
as
there
are
with
any
research
paper.
I
wrote
the
two
history
research
papers
at
the
end
of
the
fall
semester,
so
I
did
not
really
apply
much
of
what
I
had
learned
from
my
experience
with
the
FYS
class
to
these
papers.
As
a
result,
I
found
both
of
these
papers
to
be
extremely
boring
to
write.
Even
though
both
history
professors
had
given
substantial
freedom
of
choosing
any
paper
topic
within
the
scope
of
their
respective
classes,
I
still
approached
both
of
them
by
adhering
strictly
to
the
guidelines.
I
chose
easy
topics
that
were
fairly
cut
and
dry,
and
my
main
goal
was
to
write
the
correct
number
of
pages,
use
the
correct
number
of
sources
and
so
forth.
My
approach
to
my
English
paper
second
semester
was
quite
different.
I
tried
to
look
at
it
more
in
my
own
terms
rather
than
the
professorOs.
The
English
paper,
despite
being
half
the
length
of
either
of
the
history
research
papers,
proved
far
more
difficult.
I
constructed
a
thesis
that,
while
supported
in
documents,
had
(as
far
as
I
know)
never
really
been
covered
in
the
way
that
I
was
attempting.
I
put
far
more
time
and
thought
into
the
English
paper.
My
grades
on
all
three
papers
were
virtually
the
same,
but
I
felt
a
far
greater
sense
of
accomplishment
at
the
completion
of
the
English
paper
than
either
of
the
History
papers.
The
reason
for
this
was
not
that
I
like
writing
English
papers
better
than
history
papers
(I
am
a
double
major
in
English
and
history,
so
I
like
both),
but
that
I
felt
a
sense
that
the
English
paper
truly
belonged
to
me:
I
constructed
the
argument
from
scratch.
I
have
obviously
learned
a
lot
about
writing
from
being
a
WA;
knowledge
that
I
applied
last
semester
somewhat
unconsciously.
When
I
was
thinking
about
what
I
could
say
in
this
paper,
I
knew
that
my
writing
style
had
changed,
but
I
couldnOt
quite
put
my
finger
on
it.
Now
it
is
clear
to
me
that,
in
addition
to
several
other
things,
my
approach
to
assignments
has
changed.
I
think
this
new
approach
is
a
better
one,
and
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
(or
if)
it
changes
again
after
another
year
as
a
WA.
