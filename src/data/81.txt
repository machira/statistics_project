MY
W.A.
EXPERIENCE
August
22,
1996
As
a
second
year
W.A.,
I
have
found
that
I
have
gained
a
new
confidence
when
presented
with
an
opportunity
to
write.
No
matter
what
the
assignment
requests,
I
completely
trust
that
I
will
persevere
through
the
writing
process
journey
to
produce
a
paper
reflecting
not
only
the
assignment,
but
a
paper
with
a
style
and
hint
of
my
personality,
as
well.
This
confidence
has
taken
twenty-one
years
to
acquire
and
it
has
been
well
worth
the
wait.
To
experience
the
art
of
teaching
is
all
I
believe
a
person
needs
to
realize
their
true
writing
potential.
Being
a
W.
A.
has
certainly
presented
me
with
this
experience,
and
it
has
left
me
with
the
most
wonderful
of
human
qualities
--
self-esteem.
I
have
not
always
possessed
this
quality
in
my
writing
history,
in
fact,
my
memories
of
high
school
remind
me
of
how
inferior
I
felt
in
comparison
to
my
peers
in
Advanced
Placement
English.
I
completely
bombed
our
first
book
analysis.
My
teacher,
Mr.
Pane,
wrote
Not
quite,
Clare
on
the
top
of
my
paper
critiquing
the
novel,
Pride
and
Prejudice.
From
that
point
on,
I
strived
to
become
one
of
those
students
whose
names
were
written
on
the
board
by
Mr.
Pane
for
other
members
of
the
class
to
go
to
in
order
to
view
an
excellently
written
piece
of
literature.
I
finally
attained
my
goal
by
having
my
name
spelled
out
in
white
chalk
on
three
separate
occasions.
My
shining
moment
was
when
Mr.
Pane
wrote
on
the
back
of
my
paper
entitled,
Would
Hamlet
Be
Acquitted
In
A
Court
Of
Law
Today
If
He
Pleaded
Temporary
Insanity?,
that
he
felt
I
had
really
become
a
star
in
his
class.
These
experiences
gave
me
the
initiative
I
needed
to
be
successful
with
the
assignments
distributed
to
me
throughout
my
first
two
years
at
Lafayette.
I
had
taken
those
first
few
steps
towards
becoming
a
confident
writer,
but
I
had
not
yet
crossed
the
bridge
to
the
side
where
self-esteem
and
confidence
rule
the
land.
It
was
not
until
I
honestly
helped
others
to
write
more
concisely,
and
more
eloquently
while
organizing
their
thoughts,
that
I
truly
began
to
understand
that
I
have
a
talent,
and
I
have
the
ability
to
share
this
talent
in
an
effective
manner.
My
junior
year
was
the
time
frame
most
important
in
my
trek
across
that
bridge,
and
ultimately
my
safe
arrival
into
that
magical
land.
While
the
journey
was
very
self-fulfilling
and
fun
at
times,
I
recognize
that
those
moments
in
which
I
felt
the
most
frustrated,
insecure,
and
out-and-out
furious,
were
the
moments
that
must
be
endured
to
reach
that
haven
across
the
rocky
water.
Those
moments
were
far
and
few,
but
nevertheless,
I
remember
each
clearly.
I
was
amazed
at
how
poorly
the
students
in
my
FYS
Seminar
wrote.
Granted
that
some
had
probably
not
spent
an
enormous
amount
of
time
on
their
drafts,
it
was
astonishing
to
see
grammar
so
blatantly
misused,
or
shall
I
say,
abused.
I
knew
I
should
look
past
grammar,
as
it
is
a
LOC,
and
I
did,
only
to
find
that
most
papers
had
no
sense
of
organization,
no
sense
of
how
imperative
it
is
to
write
an
outline.
I
spent
hours
writing
epics
on
their
drafts
for
the
first
paper,
only
to
find
that
the
second
paper
drafts
expressed
no
improvement.
Imagine
how
frustrating
I
had
felt.
I
decided
not
to
write
novels
on
their
drafts,
but
rather
to
actually
ask
the
first
year
student
to
tell
me
how
they
had
planned
to
write
this
paper
and
whether
or
not
they
had
made
an
attempt
at
writing
an
outline.
Most
had
not;
therefore,
1
told
them
to
take
out
a
pen
and
jot
down
a
mini-outline
right
then
and
there
on
the
back
of
their
drafts.
This
system
worked
-
their
next
drafts
clearly
demonstrated
that
they
had
organized
their
thoughts
before
they
had
taken
pen
to
paper.
Another
moment
of
frustration
occurred
during
second
semester
when
I
was
the
W.
A.
to
a
VAST
Seminar.
The
professor
had
only
given
me
a
typed
sheet
of
the
assignment;
we
had
not
sat
down
and
verbally
discussed
his
expectations,
as
he
had
done
with
the
students.
I
interpreted
the
assignment
to
be
fairly
straight
forward
and
predicted
that
the
students
would
agree.
I
couldn't
have
been
more
wrong.
The
students
all
entered
Pardee
319
with
baffled
looks
across
their
faces
and
endless
questions
to
fire
at
me
about
how
to
meet
the
professor's
expectations
with
this
paper.
I
tried
to
be
consistent
in
my
responses.
Most
of
the
papers
did
not
address
the
core
of
the
assignment
in
my
opinion,
and
I
let
them
know
this.
I
realize
now
that
I
was
narrow-minded
in
directing
the
students
to
write
their
final
copies
with
only
my
interpretation
of
the
assignment
as
a
guideline.
It
was
not
until
one
bold
student
challenged
my
advice
and
rudely
protested
my
interpretation
while
storming
out
of
the
W.
A.
Room,
insisting
that
he
had
already
had
the
professor
approve
his
draft.
I
immediately
scheduled
a
meeting
with
the
professor
and
posed
my
concerns
on
how
I
might
have
been
advising
the
students
incorrectly.
He
told
me
that
he
had
indeed
approved
that
student's
paper.
Adrenaline
surged
through
my
veins
and
I
felt
my
knees
go
weak.
At
this
moment
it
hit
me
that
I
had
counseled
others
to
conform
to
only
my
interpretation,
when
their
original
ideas
had
been
acceptable.
I
expressed
how
I
felt
to
this
laid-back
man
who
reassured
me
that
he
would
speak
to
the
class
and
explain
the
misunderstanding.
He
then
admitted
that
he
probably
had
not
written
the
assignment
as
well
as
he
should
have.
Regardless
of
the
professors
confession,
I
knew
I
had
committed
a
writer's
felony.
I
took
from
this
experience
the
valuable
lesson
that
there
are
no
boundaries
in
the
art
of
writing,
and
I
had
no
right
to
have
had
set
such
strict
ones.
Following
directions
is
important,
but
creativity
and
a
little
divergence
can
certainly
make
prose
much
more
enjoyable.
I
will
never
again
just
accept
a
written
assignment,
I
will
always
plan
to
discuss
it
with
the
professor,
even
if
he
insists
that
he
has
no
time.
With
these
discouraging
moments,
I
ironically
became
more
encouraged.
I
have
polished
my
own
writing
progressively
throughout
the
past
academic
year
and
summer.
This
was
due
to
my
paying
more
attention
to
the
wisdom
I
had
bestowed
upon
my
W.A.
classes,
by
gaining
wisdom
professed
by
other
W.A.s
in
their
personal
writing
styles
and
their
unique
approaches
to
their
W.A.
classes'
writing
problems,
and
finally,
by
my
summer
experiences
working
in
the
Division
of
Clinical
Care
Research
at
New
England
Medical
Center
in
Boston,
Massachusetts.
I
failed
to
follow
my
own
advise
when
I
began
to
write
what
had
seemed
to
me
as
a
blow-off"
paper
for
my
Japanese
Civilization
and
Culture
class.
Much
to
my
dismay,
the
paper
soon
transformed
into
an
arduous
task.
My
paragraphs
were
all
mumble-jumbled.
I
realized
how
hypocritical
I
had
been
in
not
even
applying
my
own
advise
on
the
importance
of
creating
an
outline.
From
that
point
on,
no
matter
how
unimportant
the
assignment
might
seem,
1
always
scribble
down
my
main
points
in
sequential
order.
During
our
weekly
staff
meetings,
other
W.
A.s
shared
techniques
they
had
adapted
as
solutions
to
the
misgivings
of
their
students'
papers.
I
actually
applied
these
techniques
to
my
own
writing
and
immediately
saw
improvements.
1
began
to
read
each
of
my
works
aloud
-
a
piece
of
advice
expressed
by
Tara
Feehan.
The
benefits
of
this
simple
act
are
tremendous
--
not
only
are
errors
in
tenses
detected,
but
the
writer
can
pick
up
on
repetition
and
lack
of
transitional
sentences,
as
well.
I
utilized
my
new
found
skill
at
New
England
Medical
Center,
and
my
supervisors
were
impressed.
As
news
traveled
through
the
department
that
I
had
a
knack
for
catching
grammatical
and
contextual
errors,
I
was
swarmed
with
grant
proposals,
articles
to
be
published,
and
memos
to
proofread
and
offer
suggestions
of
improvement
for.
This
constant
practice
all
summer
has
only
sharpened
my
skills.
I
feel
confident
with
my
ability
to
honestly
make
a
difference
in
my
upcoming
W.
A.
classes'
papers.
I
know
my
writing
will
forever
be
in
need
of
improvement,
but
I
do
feel
fortunate
in
that
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
be
a
W.
A.
and
to
reach
a
point
in
my
writing
skills
where
I
finally
feel
CONFIDENT!!!!!!!
