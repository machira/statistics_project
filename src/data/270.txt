Writing
Like
a
WA:
A
Comedy
of
Errors
Mhairi
August
18,
2000
If
I
were
really
to
write
this
paper
as
I
wrote
like
a
WA,
I
should
leave
it
outside
for
a
few
nights
to
weather
or
lose
it
crumpled
in
the
bottom
of
my
bookbag
until
the
day
before
it
is
due
and
hand
it
in
anyway.
If
I
tell
the
truth,
I
may
get
fired
but
I
have
not
written
as
a
WA.
At
least,
I
have
not
written
like
a
WA
should.
I
wrote
four
papers
last
year,
total.
I
was
disappointed
with
the
results
of
my
works,
but
more
disappointed
in
the
effects
that
these
"failures"
have
had
on
me.
I
don't
think
that
my
experiences
last
year
are
appropriate
for
any
student
to
go
through,
whether
a
WA
or
not
and
I
suspect,
what's
more,
that
my
position
as
a
WA
helped
to
undo
me
and
destroy
my
self-image
as
a
writer.
This
year,
I
intend
to
raise
my
self-image
out
of
the
rubble.
In
the
fall
semester,
I
worked
as
a
WA
at
Lafayette.
I
only
wrote
one
paper
in
the
whole
semester
and
I
am
proud
of
that
one
paper
because
it
was
full
of
death
and
poisonous
chemicals.
I
was
interested
in
my
subject
and
the
class;
I
was
inspired.
I
was
positively
drawn
to
my
topic
and
the
possibility
to
write
about
slow,
painful
death.
Research
went
smoothly
and
I
had
access
to
all
my
tools
including
my
computer,
my
teacher,
an
assignment
sheet,
and
my
friends
whom
I
use
as
a
sounding
board.
.
I
gathered
materials
from
technical
and
general
sources
and
I
was
able
to
combine
technical
detail
with
less-
and
non-technical
information.
The
paper
was
heroic
and
because
I
wrote
it
at
the
end
of
my
semester
as
a
WA,
I
was
obsessive
about
grammar
and
transition.
I
was
more
aware
of
writing
mistakes
as
I
pointed
them
out
in
all
my
conferences
and
I
took
a
vigorous
stance
on
editing,
just
to
be
sure
that
I
did
not
commit
any
of
the
600
most
common
surface
errors,
whatever
they
all
are.
After
a
semester
in
which
I
only
wrote
one
paper,
I
felt
like
a
reader,
not
a
writer.
I
thought
that
maybe
most
engineers
write
poorly
because
they
hardly
ever
get
a
chance
to
write.
I
didn't
think
I
could
be
less
passionate
about
education
until
I
went
abroad.
There,
I
became
a
reader
without
books.
I
stagnated.
I
had
no
interest
in
writing
because
nothing
I
did
at
school
in
Brussels
was
treated
with
any
care.
No
homework,
minimal
discussion,
and
no
interaction
with
other
students
and
faculty
were
suddenly
the
fare.
The
new
system
did
not
suit
me.
I
was
not
interested
in
pleasing
my
teachers
and
I
had
no
idea
how.
Why
should
I
write
for
teachers
whose
speech
(let
alone
whose
writing)
was
as
hard
to
follow
as
the
papers
I
had
edited
as
a
WA?
I
did
not
respect
my
professors,
their
writing,
or
their
authority
as
readers
or
graders
of
my
papers.
Writing
in
Brussels
was
difficult.
First,
finding
resources
in
English
limited
the
amount
and
quality
of
information
that
was
available
to
me.
I
scoured
the
library
and
the
internet.
I
traded
sources
with
other
students
in
my
classes,
but
I
was
never
comfortable
with
my
research.
When
I
tried
to
write
my
papers,
I
found
I
was
missing
my
computer,
my
friends,
and
any
source
of
inspiration.
My
history
professor
was
not
available
for
advice
so
I
was
all-alone
on
that
paper,
but
I
went
to
my
Art
professor
to
conference
over
my
art
paper.
After
he
approved
it
and
I
knew
where
I
was
going,
I
headed
home
thinking
I
could
pull
the
paper
off.
When
that
professor
did
not
grade
my
paper
but
instead
gave
it
to
another
professor
to
grade
for
him,
I
was
crushed!
The
woman
who
graded
my
paper
said
that
it
lacked
content
and
suggested
that
I
write
it
in
another
language!
I
felt
that
this
experience
indicated
a
complete
lack
of
professionalism
on
the
part
of
the
two
professors.
Whatever
respect
may
have
lingered
for
the
school
was
lost.
My
history
paper
also
bombed.
I
had
a
topic
that
interested
me
but
one
which
I
could
not
analyze
completely.
I
collected
articles
but
I
was
unable
to
explain
the
heart
of
the
problem,
which
was
a
nationalistic
rivalry
and
a
sentiment
rather
than
a
fact.
This
paper
flopped
without
any
legs
to
stand
on.
When
I
got
this
paper
back,
I
was
even
more
disappointed
by
the
grading.
My
professor
was
not
familiar
with
MLA
citations
and
every
place
that
he
corrected
my
citations
I
became
more
discouraged.
The
paper
was
not
good
and
I
knew
it
but
instead
of
being
disappointed
with
myself
for
not
trying
harder,
I
grew
more
and
more
reluctant
to
participate
in
class
and
increasingly
resentful
of
my
professor.
Although
my
greatest
obstacle
in
writing
was
now
my
attitude,
I
began
to
understand
how
other
writers
feel.
The
writers
I
had
helped
as
a
WA
came
to
me
confused
about
where
to
start
and
what
people
expected
of
them.
Finally,
I
have
a
reference
for
what
that
feels
like.
Having
done
poorly
frustrated
me
and
because
I
was
frustrated
I
tried
less
and
did
worse!
I
understood
why
some
students
can
come
to
conferences
with
no
writing
or
why
they
sometimes
expected
me
to
write
their
papers
with
them.
After
these
bad
writing
experiences,
I
wanted
to
have
help
with
my
final
paper
last
year.
I
asked
a
person
whose
opinion
I
trust
to
be
my
WA
and
help
me
revise
my
paper.
I
worked
hardest
on
the
final
paper
I
wrote
for
many
reasons.
Key
among
these
reasons
is
the
impending
publication
of
the
paper,
but
I
also
wanted
to
regain
some
of
the
"strength"
I
felt
I
had
as
a
writer.
This
paper,
for
the
McKelvy
journal
was
for
export
to
the
United
States
where
I
was
happier
as
a
writer
and
where
I
felt
that
people
would
be
more
receptive
of
my
writing.
Also,
by
the
end
of
my
stay
in
Belgium,
I
had
been
longing
to
write
in
English
and
to
come
back
to
my
home.
Perhaps
it
was
mostly
because
this
paper
was
to
be
published,
but
I
worked
exceptionally
hard
to
make
this
paper
worth
writing
and
tried
to
make
it
worth
reading.
I
found
this
writing
task
most
difficult
of
all
the
papers
I
had
written
ever.
I
had
no
direction
for
the
paper.
I
chose
my
subject
on
a
whim
and
although
I
drew
from
the
house
discussions
to
write
my
paper,
the
fall
semester
seemed
so
long
ago
that
I
lost
my
direction.
I
worked
hard
on
my
McKelvy
paper.
I
spent
more
time
on
it
than
on
the
other
papers
I
wrote
abroad
and
held
conferences
over
the
paper
but
in
the
end
I
was
disappointed
with
my
paper
just
like
everything
else
I
wrote.
I
was
less
comfortable
with
it
than
I
had
been
with
my
other
papers
despite
or
maybe
even
because
I
had
been
so
conscientious
about
editing
and
preparing
it.
Because
I
had
spent
so
much
time
going
over
the
paper,
I
was
more
aware
of
its
problems
and
I
wished
that
I
had
the
time
and
skill
to
make
it
perfect.
I
guess
what
I
am
saying
is
that
being
a
WA
made
me
more
aware
of
other
writer's
shortfalls.
It
made
me
overly-confident
and
then
vulnerable
when
I
was
challenged.
My
experience
as
a
WA
made
me
ask
myself
if
it
was
really
possible
that
people
wrote
so
poorly.
I
thought
that
if
they
could
write
like
that,
I
could
have
nothing
to
fear
and
I
gradually
became
sloppier
as
a
writer.
I
handed
in
papers
that
I
would
never
have
accepted
as
a
WA
and
I
truly
earned
the
consequences.
When
I
received
the
consequences,
though,
I
was
too
blind
to
see
that
I
had
deserved
it
and
was
instead
more
cocky,
frustrated,
and
sloppy.
I
began
to
remind
myself
of
one
of
the
students
that
I
had
conference
with
as
a
WA.
He
showed
up
late
to
every
meeting
with
no
papers.
When
I
suggested
changes
or
tried
to
select
paragraphs
that
I
felt
contained
recurring
problems,
this
one
boy
never
saw
the
point
behind
my
suggestions.
I
had
been
lazy
and
didn't
find
help
with
my
papers
because
I
was
not
ready
to
take
advice
and
help
from
the
people
who
were
offering.
I
challenged
myself
as
a
writer
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
writing
program
challenges
first-year
students.
I
had
to
learn
to
ask
for
help
and
to
find
it
from
my
peers.
I
hope
no
new
WA's
make
the
same
mistake
that
I
did,
although
I
suspect
that
it
is
not
uncommon.
I
would
tell
other
WA's
that
they
should
be
as
careful
about
their
writing
as
they
are
with
the
writing
of
the
students
in
the
class
that
they
WA
for.
If
they
were
to
learn
from
my
experiences,
too,
I
would
hope
that
other
WA's
start
off
the
year
understanding
how
it
feels
to
be
completely
lost
in
a
paper
and
a
class,
and
to
not
care
how
bad
a
paper
is
as
long
as
it
is
finished.
I
wouldn't
wish
a
year
like
mine
on
anyone
because
it
really
was
not
fun,
but
I
have
a
better
idea
how
to
relate
to
the
people
that
I
meet
in
WA
conferences.
Last
year,
I
made
a
student
cry
in
a
conference.
I
felt
horrible
for
it,
but
I
think
that
now
I
might
be
able
to
handle
the
situation
better.
I
realized
in
my
conferences
(the
one
with
crying
and
others)
that
many
of
the
students
I
meet
as
a
WA
will
not
know
terms
such
as
tone
and
diction.
Using
this
"technical"
vocabulary
was
part
of
the
misunderstanding
that
caused
the
student
to
cry
in
a
conference.
I
used
a
term
and
as
I
tried
to
explain
it,
the
student
felt
that
I
left
him
behind,
and
I
made
him
feel
stupid.
This
coming
year,
I
will
try
not
to
repeat
that
mistake
although
I
think
it
is
important
for
people
to
understand
these
words,
I
will
try
to
extend
my
position
to
explain
the
concepts.
I
will
not
assume
that
the
students
I
meet
have
entered
college
with
the
same
writing
knowledge
as
I
gained
in
high
school.
My
first
conferences
last
year
were
awkward
because
I
felt
that
I
did
not
receive
any
ideas
how
to
conference
either
from
the
interview
or
from
the
training.
I
wish
other
people
had
told
me
that
they
felt
the
same!
This
year,
I
am
more
prepared
for
my
conferences
because
I
have
a
few
under
my
belt
and
although
I
cannot
help
new
WA's
give
their
first
conferences
I
will
certainly
be
available
to
help
them
recover
from
the
shock
after
they
have
finished
their
conferences.
Being
a
WA
requires
moral
support
and
understanding.
I
will
look
to
give
and
receive
this
from
my
other
WA's.
I
think
it
will
help
for
the
WA's
to
get
to
know
each
other
and,
as
usual,
I
will
look
to
extend
myself
as
help
to
all
new
and
returning
WA's.
I
will
also
call
on
them
to
help
me
prepare
for
my
conferences
and
to
get
second
opinions
on
papers
and
problems
where
I
have
difficulty.
I
learned
that
WA's
need
support
from
one
another
and
I
observed
other
WA's
to
get
ideas
for
my
conferences.
I
used
their
support
and
my
previous
experiences
to
develop
a
more
constructive
way
to
conference
and
by
the
end
of
the
semester
last
fall,
I
was
able
to
call
out
of
students
their
ideas
for
papers
and
to
help
others
develop
thesis-spotting
skills.
One
of
the
most
helpful
experiences
for
developing
my
conferences
occurred
in
Belgium
in
March.
Because
I
volunteered
in
the
writing
center
where
I
was
a
"tutor"
the
director
of
the
writing
center
observed
me
giving
a
conference.
I
learned
from
the
mistakes
that
she
pointed
out
to
me
and
became
more
confident
in
my
conferencing
skills
because
of
the
positive
things
that
she
pointed
out
to
me.
I
am
looking
forward
to
conferences
this
semester
because
I
learned
last
semester
that
a
half-hour
is
not
long
enough
to
work
over
a
whole
paper.
I
hope
to
be
able
to
make
myself
more
available
to
students
in
my
FYS.
In
the
conference
where
I
was
observed,
the
director
of
the
writing
center
was
able
to
make
me
feel
more
conformable
with
writers
because
she
thought
that
I
handled
my
relationship
with
the
other
student
well.
However,
I
have
challenges
for
myself
this
semester
to
try
to
remember
my
conferences
and
students
better.
Although
I
get
along
with
them
in
conferences,
I
want
to
work
on
knowing
them
as
more
than
just
writers.
I
want
to
reach
a
relationship
where,
when
they
see
me
on
campus,
they
say,
"There's
Mhairi,"
not,
"There's
my
WA."
Another
goal
for
my
conferences
this
semester
is
to
do
less
of
the
writing
myself.
This
goal
comes
from
a
suggestion
that
the
director
of
the
writing
center
made
in
Brussels.
She
noticed
that
I
made
most
of
the
comments
on
the
paper
and
that,
as
a
result,
the
writers
may
feel
that
I
was
rearranging
or
rewriting
their
papers
for
them.
I
thought
that
it
was
odd
for
her
to
say
this,
since
the
students
who
work
in
the
writing
center
there
are
called
tutors.
I
wrote
an
article
for
the
Brussels
writing
center's
newsletter
about
how
I
preferred
to
be
called
a
Writing
Associate
and
my
goal
for
this
coming
year
is
to
be
true
to
that
preference.
I
prefer
to
be
an
educated,
experienced
writer
working
with
a
student
writer
than
to
be
a
tutor
and
I
want
that
preference
to
be
more
noticeable
in
my
conferences.
I
do
not
want
to
intimidate
or
bully
students
in
my
conferences;
I
can't
wait
to
let
them
know
I
want
to
work
with
them,
to
help
them.
To
this
end,
I
will
make
efforts
not
to
write
too
much
on
the
papers
as
I
read
them
and
I
will
make
a
point
to
conduct
my
conferences
in
a
more
organized
way,
to
ask
the
students
for
their
insight,
and
to
make
them
more
comfortable.
From
my
first
year
as
a
WA
I
learned
about
helping
students
with
their
papers
and
in
doing
so,
I
learned
skills
and
rules
which
should
have
helped
me
with
my
writing.
Most
of
all,
through
my
failures
as
a
writer,
I
learned
things
that
I
should
have
figured
out
as
a
freshman.
I
learned
how
much
it
helps
to
have
someone
prepared
to
read
your
paper,
give
an
honest
opinion,
and
help
edit.
I
learned
what
a
relief
it
is
to
be
at
the
receiving
end
of
a
successful
and
helpful
conference
over
a
difficult
assignment.
Writing
a
paper
is
a
greater
endeavor
than
I
had
previously
thought.
Maybe
I
have
been
lucky
up
to
now
that
I
did
not
have
trouble
writing
my
papers,
but
I
have
discovered
now
how
difficult
it
can
be.
I
intend
to
use
the
drop-in
service
next
year
and
to
encourage
my
friends
to
do
likewise
when
they
have
papers.
I
am
also
looking
forward
to
this
year
so
that
I
may
be
able
to
put
my
new
perspective
to
use
and
help
other
students
as
much
as
other
people
have
helped
me
hopefully
more
than
I
helped
the
students
I
WAed
for
last
year.
