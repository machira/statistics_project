My
Literacy
Narrative
Fall
1998
Writing
is
a
process.
It
is
a
process
that
must
be
learned
over
time.
It
is
a
process
that
evolves
as
we
learn,
as
we
experience,
and
as
we
try.
It
is
said
that
practice
makes
perfect
and
that
can
definitely
be
applied
to
writing.
The
more
written
pieces
we
produce,
the
more
we
can
see
what
aspects
of
our
writing
we
need
to
improve
and
what
aspects
we
have
down
to
a
near
perfect
science.
However,
perfecting
the
writing
process
is
not
as
easy
as
learning,
for
example,
to
throw
a
baseball.
With
a
baseball
we
are
shown
how
to
throw
once
and
then
we
just
keep
throwing
and
throwing
until
we
get
it
right.
It
is
something
that
once
we
are
shown
how
to
do
we
can
basically
learn
on
our
own.
With
writing
however,
we
must
write
and
rewrite,
cross
out
and
revise.
But,
most
importantly
we
must
share
our
work
with
others
because
it
is
the
complements
and
criticism
we
receive
that
improve
our
writing
the
most.
Writing,
unlike
many
of
the
other
things
that
we
do,
is
a
work
in
progress
that
requires
both
the
skills
and
energy
of
the
writer
as
well
as,
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
the
input
of
an
outside
source.
My
experience
as
a
writer
has,
fortunately,
been
a
successful
one
and
just
like
other
writers
my
age,
I
am
still
perfecting
my
process.
Before
giving
my
literacy
history,
I
am
able
to
make
one
general
observation
on
how
my
writing
process
has
changed.
Throughout
elementary
school,
I
honestly
believe
it
was
the
goal
of
my
teachers
to
show
us
how
to
write,
spell
and
use
correct
grammar
without
ever
giving
us
the
chance
to
practice
what
we
learned.
All
of
my
writing
assignments,
which
were
few
and
far
between,
required
me
to
recite
facts
found
from
an
encyclopedia.
Often
I
even
had
the
option
to
make
a
video
or
a
poster
instead
of
a
written
piece.
However,
upon
entering
high
school,
my
teachers
focused
less
on
the
little
details,
but
actually
showed
us
how
to
think
through
our
writing,
how
to
organize
and
analyze
and
come
to
conclusions
that
we
could
put
on
the
page.
Thus,
the
major
shift
in
my
writing
came
when
I
was
no
longer
allowed
to
write
facts
and
draw
little
pictures
based
on
the
information
I
was
given,
but
when
I
had
to
take
the
information,
make
it
my
own,
and
then
produce
something
totally
new.
My
early
years
of
writing
can
be
characterized
by
a
desire
to
associate
every
written
word
with
some
sort
of
a
visual
picture.
What
I
recall
as
my
earliest
writing
experience
was
learning
to
write
a
sentence.
Back
in
first
grade
our
assignment
on
an
almost
daily
basis
was
to
write
a
sentence,
i.e.
there
are
fish
in
the
bowl.
Then
we
had
to
draw
a
picture
that
would
correspond
to
the
sentence.
Ms.
Nielson
would
then
grade
our
writing
and
our
pictures.
I
would
often
get
a
check
plus
and
then
think
I
was
some
sort
of
a
great
writer.
My
first
grade
teacher
really
encouraged
us
to
try
and
write.
Thus,
in
her
class
not
only
did
I
learn
the
art
of
the
simple
sentence
and
the
meanings
of
many
words,
but
I
was
also
able
to
use
my
first
writing
samples
as
refrigerator
art.
My
early
years
of
writing
did
not
require
me
to
produce
wonderful
pieces.
Most
of
what
had
to
be
written
was
the
simple
report
giving
the
facts
of
something.
In
many
cases
we
even
had
the
option
to
chose
between
writing
and
making
a
video
or
some
sort
of
presentation.
I
remember
often
feeling
that
the
presentation
was
always
the
easy
way
out
and
for
some
reason
that
was
what
I
always
chose.
I
think
during
my
early
years
I
was
afraid
to
write
and
unfortunately
my
teachers
did
not
do
anything
to
encourage
me.
Throughout
my
middle
school
years
I
was
enrolled
in
what
my
school
called
a
Gifted
and
Talented
Language
Arts
Program.
Thus,
I
never
really
had
a
standard
English
class
where
I
learned
to
write.
Everything
in
my
Gifted
and
Talented
class
revolved
around
creativity,
not
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
that,
but
I
never
learned
anything
that
would
help
me
in
my
later
years
of
schooling.
We
focused
much
of
our
time
on
learning
to
spell
words
like
"pneumonia
and
sycophant."
In
addition,
we
learned
a
lot
of
grammar.
But
up
to
this
point
in
my
writing
career,
I
can
honestly
say
that
I
had
not
done
much
writing.
Any
that
I
had
done
required
me
to
regurgitate
facts
and
information,
never
did
I
have
to
truly
analyze,
organize,
or
really
even
think
to
produce
a
paper.
Finally,
I
entered
ninth
grade
and
boy
was
I
in
for
a
big
surprise.
What
I
had
been
used
to
learning
in
elementary
schools,
spelling,
grammar
and
producing
a
video
or
a
play
were
days
of
long
ago.
The
structured
essay
that
was
never
assigned,
that
was
never
mentioned
by
my
teachers
as
something
we
might
have
to
learn
was
about
to
become
a
staple
of
everyday
life,
about
as
basic
as
making
an
egg
or
brushing
my
teeth.
On
the
first
day
of
English
9
Accelerated,
Ms.
Fischer,
who,
little
did
I
know
at
the
time
would
become
the
most
influential
teacher
on
my
writing,
gave
an
assignment
that
I
thought
was
a
joke.
She
told
us
to
write
a
paragraph.
Without
giving
us
a
specific
topic
she
told
us
to
write
a
paragraph
concerning
some
sort
of
current
event.
So,
assuming
that
my
paragraph
would
take
about
ten
minutes,
I
went
home,
wrote
my
paragraph
and
by
3:45,1
was
done.
A
few
days
later
I
got
back
what
I
thought
was
a
decent
piece
of
writing.
It
had
a
big
D
on
the
top.
I
could
not
believe
it.
Who
was
this
woman
to
give
me
a
D
on
my
first
piece
of
high
school
writing?
Who
was
she
to
tell
me
that
I
could
not
write?
It
was
only
a
paragraph
how
bad
could
it
have
been?
I
looked
around
at
my
classmates
and
saw
looks
very
similar
to
the
way
I
was
feeling.
Stunned.
Startled.
Scared
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
very
long
freshman
year.
Here
I
was
in
an
honors
class,
surrounded
by
the
smartest
people
in
my
grade,
and
much
to
my
surprise,
after
eight
years
of
elementary
school
none
of
us
knew
how
to
write.
After
spending
numerous
afternoons
sitting
with
Ms.
Fischer
analyzing
my
writing,
much
of
what
I
was
starting
to
produce
was
actually
pretty
good.
She
gave
me
her
time
and
her
input,
and
although
at
some
times
I
did
not
want
to
hear
it,
Ms.
Fischer
had
taught
me
to
write
not
only
an
essay,
but
a
book
review,
not
a
book
report,
a
movie
review,
and
a
term
paper.
She
taught
me
every
last
detail
about
the
popular
five-paragraph
essay.
She
drilled
it
into
my
head
and
soon
all
I
could
think
was
'Topic
Sentence,
Major
1,
Minor
1,
Major
2,
Minor
2,
Major
2,
Minor
3,
Concluding
Sentence."
She
made
me
realize
that
general
was
bad
and
specific
was
the
key
to
excellent
writing.
Perhaps
the
most
important
element
that
I
learned
that
year
was
that
it
was
essential
to
provide
evidence
or
proof
to
back
up
my
theories.
At
first
I
thought
evidence?
How
could
I
go
about
finding
proof?
After
all,
finding
a
quote
in
a
six
hundred-
page
book
or
in
a
three
hour
long
movie
seems
to
be
a
much
more
difficult
task
than
if
I
had
to
find
a
bloody
shirt
as
proof
of
a
murder.
Quickly,
I
learned
that
evidence
was
going
to
be
my
friend.
I
realized
that
of
all
the
tools
I
had
learned,
using
evidence
would
be
the
most
important
element
to
keep
in
mind.
At
this
point
it
became
absolutely
possible
to
make
almost
any
argument
and
it
would
have
to
be
accepted
as
long
as
I
was
able
to
provide
the
evidence
directly
from
the
book
or
film.
I
realized
I
could
prove
my
point
by
making
the
proof
work
for
me.
After
Ms.
Fischer's
class
I
became
an
expert
on
the
five-
paragraph
essay.
In
fact
I
had
it
down
to
a
science.
In
high
school
I
had
used
it
mostly
in
English
classes,
but
once
arriving
at
college
I
found
that
I
could
use
this
simple,
yet
effective
style
in
almost
any
class
from
math
to
geology
to
history.
The
model
of
the
five-
paragraph
essay
is
the
mold
that
I
am
most
comfortable
following.
For
every
major
there
is
a
minor,
for
every
topic
sentence
there
is
a
conclusion.
I
could
write
my
papers
blindfolded
and
fortunately,
my
technique
was
successful
when
I
arrived
here
at
Lafayette.
At
the
end
of
my
freshman
year
of
high
school,
I
thanked
Ms.
Fischer
for
both
her
complements
and
her
criticisms,
which
at
times
were
very
harsh.
Not
only
did
she
teach
me
how
to
write,
but
with
that
came
learning
the
skills
of
organization,
conciseness,
and
proving
my
point.
Very
rarely,
even
now,
do
I
find
myself
straying
from
this
rigid,
but
comfortable
style
to
which
I
am
accustomed.
Occasionally,
I
make
slight
adjustments,
but
why
mess
with
a
good
thing,
that
was
getting
me
great
grades.
I
actually
have
fun
writing
essays
based
on
this
style,
no
matter
what
class
it
is
for.
However,
being
successful
with
one
style
in
no
way
means
that
with
every
style
I
have
had
the
same
success.
I
had
never
been
much
a
lover
of
poetry.
But
up
until
junior
year
I
had
managed
to
get
by
with
the
rhyming
poem
about
how
cool
my
best
friend
was
or
about
my
favorite
place.
Finally,
it
came
time
to
studying
the
sonnet
and
the
most
important
poems
of
English,
Scottish,
and
Irish
literature.
I
do
not
particularly
care
for
poems
and
half
of
the
time
when
asked
to
interpret
them
I
am
totally
wrong.
But
in
the
scheme
of
things
does
it
matter
how
I
interpret
someone
else's
poem?
After
all,
I
could
think
a
poem
is
about
the
beach
when
in
essence
it
is
about
someone's
hard
life
working
at
a
power
plant.
Poetry
is
a
personal
thing
and
as
long
as
it
means
something
to
the
writer,
that
is
what
matters.
Thus
Ms.
Dee,
one
of
my
least
favorite
teachers
loved
poetry.
There
is
one
experience
that
I
recall
that,
unfortunatelyybeen
a
major
roadblock
in
my
interest
in
poetry.
After
studying
poetry
for
a
few
months
our
assignment
was
to
write
a
sonnet,
Petrarchan
or
Shakespearean.
Now,
in
my
opinion,
poetry,
like
other
creative
writing,
is
an
expression
of
feelings
and
emotions.
For
this
assignment,
as
long
as
the
structure
was
followed
it
did
not
seem
as
though
it
would
make
much
of
a
difference
as
to
the
topic.
So,
I
sat
downjwrote
my
poem
and
actually,
for
the
first
time,
I
was
proud
of
the
poem
I
had
written.
I
sat
down,
thought
of
a
close
friend,
focused
on
one
aspect
of
him,
and
applied
my
thoughts
to
the
style
of
Petrarch.
Hey,
I
am
no
Italian
master
of
poetry,
but
I
gave
it
an
honest
effort
and
got
my
paper
back
with
a
C
on
it
and
in
big
red
letters
an
"I
don't
get
it."
You
do
not
get
it,
I
thought
to
myself;
you
do
not
have
to
get
it.
You
just
have
to
grade
me
on
my
style
and
that
is
it.
Of
course
my
disinterested
and
constantly
distracted
teacher
did
not
write
any
other
comments.
So,
she
just
did
not
get
it
and
gave
no
explanation.
I
wrote
my
poem
for
me
and
if
she
did
not
get
it,
she
did
not
have
to
be
so
rude
as
to
insinuate
that
it
was
bad.
After
all
I
do
not
get
Shakespeare,
yet
I
would
never
have
the
nerve
to
say
that
Romeo
and
Juliet
is
bad.
Well,
thanks
to
Ms.
Dee
I
have
a
small
fear
of
poetry
and
hope
that
I
never
have
to
write
it
again.
This
experience
shows
how
the
negative
input
of
one
person
who
was
unwilling
to
give
guidance
could
truly
ruin
something
for
someone
else.
After
having
gone
through
twelve
years
of
schooling,
I
would
have
to
say
that
I
came
out
a
pretty
decent
writer
and
in
addition
to
Ms.
Fischer,
I
have
two
additional
elements
to
thank.
The
first
is
my
constant
study
of
the
French
language.
I
honestly
believe
that
the
knowledge
of
another
language
has
helped
me
greatly
in
my
writing.
For
example,
when
I
was
first
asked
to
write
in
French
I
found
it
difficult
to
write
in
a
complex
manner.
But,
I
forced
myself
to
think
and
struggle,
always
trying
to
find
a
better
way
to
say
this
or
a
more
advanced
way
to
express
that
thought.
This
aspect
has
carried
over
into
my
writing
in
English
no
matter
the
material
or
the
topic.
I
am
always
trying
to
write
in
the
most
sophisticated
manner
so
that
I
can
present
my
argument
in
a
powerful
way.
Also
by
learning
French
grammar,
I
have
truly
succeeded
at
mastering
much
of
the
grammar
of
the
English
language.
The
other
element
that
has
been
important
in
my
writing
is
the
computer.
Since
using
the
computer
has
become
a
part
of
my
everyday
life,
my
writing
has
changed
drastically.
For
me,
the
pen
would
never
move
as
fast
as
I
was
thinking.
The
computer
allows
me
to
think
and
type
quickly.
I
can
then
go
back
and
fix
my
mistakes
very
easily.
I
find
it
much
easier
to
plan
out
and
organize
a
paper
by
simply
typing
whatever
comes
to
my
mind.
Often,
due
to
all
of
the
spelling
and
grammar
mistakes
I
can
hardly
understand
what
I
first
write.
However,
using
the
computer
really
allows
me
much
better
organization
and
allows
me
to
play
around
with
all
the
different
ways
of
writing.
So,
now
here
I
am
at
Lafayette
and,
fortunately,
even
upon
entering
my
FYS,
I
was
lucky
enough
to
know
how
to
write,
a
skill
that
I
noticed
that
many
of
my
peers
found
difficult.
I
am
lucky
enough
to
say
that
I
have
never
received
another"I
Don't
Get
It"
written
on
top
of
my
paper,
nor
have
I
received
any
big
red
C's
or
D's.
This
is
not
to
say
that
all
my
writing
during
Freshman
year
was
fabulous,
but
I
do
feel
as
though
I
had
learned
enough
throughout
high
school
to
allow
me
the
capability
to
put
together
a
decent
piece
that
contained
my
own
thoughts,
ideas
and
style
of
writing.
By
learning
to
write
I
have
truly
learned
how
to
think.
