My
History
as
a
Writer
My
earliest
experience
with
writing
came
with
learning
the
alphabet,
as
I
am
sure
it
does
to
most
others.
I
can
remember
singing
the
alphabet
song
and
tracing
the
letters
out
on
paper,
slowly
working
out
how
the
words
that
I
heard
and
spoke
related
to
these
symbols
on
a
page.
Once
I
was
able
to
understand
that,
I
could
start
translating
my
own
thoughts
and
observations
onto
paper.
I
started
by
writing
my
name
and
then
armed
myself
with
an
arsenal
of
words
I
could
spell
and
identify,
eventually
learning
what
a
sentence
was.
ThatOs
when
I
became
a
writer.
By
the
time
I
reached
first
grade,
writing
became
a
consistent
exercise.
I
attended
a
Montessori
school
through
sixth
grade
and
the
classes
were
arranged
with
first,
second
and
third
graders
in
the
same
class
(called
Lower
El)
and
fourth,
fifth
and
sixth
graders
in
the
same
class
(called
Upper
El).
This
was
to
facilitate
a
community
of
learning
where
the
younger
students
could
look
to
the
older
students
for
help
and
sometimes
vice
versa.
Every
week
in
Lower
El
a
different
student
would
be
chosen
to
be
the
Personality
of
the
Week
(or
POW).
Each
morning
of
that
week,
the
rest
of
the
class
would
have
the
opportunity
to
ask
that
student
questions
about
him/herself.
On
Friday
everyone
would
write
a
short
essay
about
the
POW
describing
his/her
favorite
things,
family,
activities,
etc.,
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
POW
would
get
to
keep
the
collection
of
handwritten
essays.
Looking
back
on
that
weekly
ritual,
I
feel
that
it
really
taught
me
the
writing
process;
first
gathering
ideas
then
organizing
them
into
paragraphs
and,
most
importantly,
self
and
peer
editing.
The
POW
essays
also
helped
to
familiarize
me
with
writing,
so
that
it
no
longer
felt
like
a
daunting
task
but
rather
something
I
knew
I
was
capable
of
doing.
Another
tool
that
Lower
El
gave
me
was
a
strong
knowledge
of
grammar.
Our
classroom
was
equipped
with
a
set
of
grammar
boxes
full
of
lessons
and
activities,
which
mainly
focused
on
the
parts
of
speech.
Each
student
could
complete
the
boxes
at
his/her
own
pace
as
long
as
they
were
finished
by
the
end
of
third
grade.
I
remember
that
I
flew
through
the
boxes,
finishing
when
I
was
in
second
grade.
To
me
grammar
always
seemed
like
a
puzzle
or
a
riddle,
especially
when
I
would
be
given
sentences
on
which
I
had
to
label
each
word
with
its
part
of
speech.
At
the
same
time,
I
was
learning
cursive
writing
as
well
as
how
to
type
and
use
word
processors.
I
was
required
to
use
cursive
for
any
handwritten
submissions
until
I
graduated
from
the
school
in
sixth
grade.
In
addition
the
students
were
encouraged
to
do
all
rough
drafts
by
hand
and
only
type
final
copies.
This
was
perhaps
to
encourage
us
to
practice
both
methods,
but
I
also
think
it
was
a
reflection
of
the
teachersO
habits,
since
all
of
them
went
to
school
before
computers.
As
a
result
of
this
early
influence,
I
still
write
out
all
my
notes
and
outlines
by
hand,
although
I
now
prefer
to
compose
my
drafts
directly
in
Word.
I
love
the
feeling
of
a
pen
in
my
hand,
it
feels
much
more
permanent
than
typing
and
I
also
feel
more
connected
to
the
words
when
they
are
spelled
out
in
my
own
script.
Whether
or
not
all
the
grammar
rules
have
stuck
is
another
matter,
but
I
think
that
the
grammar,
vocabulary
and
spelling
skills
that
I
acquired
early
on
have
provided
me
with
a
strong
foundation
in
language
in
terms
of
both
control
and
understanding.
During
my
Upper
El
years,
the
writing
focus
shifted
to
research
papers.
For
the
first
time
I
learned
how
to
integrate
the
ideas
of
others
with
my
own,
drawing
inspiration
from
research
rather
than
personal
experience
or
direct
questions.
This
was
also
when
I
was
introduced
to
the
word
OplagiarismO.
The
teachers
did
not
use
the
scare
tactics
I
would
become
familiar
with
in
high
school,
but
they
did
explain
how
plagiarism
was
unethical
and
taught
us
how
to
avoid
it
by
using
citations
and
a
bibliography.
After
that
I
learned
how
to
use
encyclopedias,
look
up
topics
in
a
bookOs
index
and
do
internet
searches
for
scholarly
information
(although
a
strong
emphasis
was
placed
on
book
research).
My
first
research
paper
was
about
Ellis
Island
and
the
experience
of
the
immigrants
who
passed
through
it,
which
I
wrote
at
the
end
of
fourth
grade.
It
was
probably
only
three
pages
long,
but
I
was
so
proud
of
it
and
I
can
remember
excitedly
showing
my
parents
when
I
was
finished.
It
was
the
first
time
I
felt
that
I
had
written
something
real
and
official,
not
only
because
it
was
typed
but
because
I
had
worked
very
hard
and
had
many
drafts
with
corrections
and
changes
to
show
for
it.
Following
my
Ellis
Island
paper,
I
wrote
several
more
research
papers
that
would
eventually
lead
up
to
the
senior
project,
a
rite
of
passage
for
all
students
who
passed
through
the
Montessori
school.
For
this
assignment
each
student
picked
a
topic
of
his/her
choice
on
which
to
write
a
seven
page
paper
and
give
a
presentation
to
all
the
sixth
graders
and
their
parents.
Now
there
were
only
seven
students
in
my
sixth
grade
class
but
since
this
was
my
first
formal
presentation
that
seemed
like
a
lot
of
people.
I
chose
Tsar
Nicholas
II
as
my
topic,
focusing
on
his
family
and
their
demise
through
the
Russian
Revolution.
It
was
a
really
interesting
subject
but
a
lot
of
the
books
on
the
matter
went
a
little
over
my
head
at
age
twelve.
The
project
was
spread
out
over
two
months
or
so
and
there
were
lots
of
steps
and
deadlines
along
the
way
so
that
we
would
not
become
overwhelmed
by
the
whole
thing.
The
first
month
was
simply
a
time
for
research
and
outlining
and
I
filled
many
pages
of
a
notebook
with
extensive
information
from
my
reading.
When
it
came
time
to
write
the
paper,
I
did
struggle
to
fill
so
many
pages.
After
rereading
the
paper
more
recently,
I
concluded
that
my
trouble
was
that
I
was
trying
to
simplify
a
very
complicated
topic,
mostly
because
I
did
not
understand
everything
when
I
was
writing.
In
my
peer
edits,
the
common
critique
was
that
I
needed
to
use
more
variety
in
word
choice
and
sentence
structure,
which
is
a
stylistic
element
that
I
continue
to
have
trouble
with
sometimes.
Nevertheless,
the
senior
project
was
a
culmination
of
all
the
writing
skills
I
had
learned
at
the
Montessori
school
and
I
am
still
happy
with
it
because
I
believe
it
truly
reflects
that.
My
transition
to
middle
school
was
a
difficult
one,
not
because
I
was
inadequately
prepared
academically
but
because
I
was
a
bit
underdeveloped
socially
since
I
had
come
from
such
a
tiny
school.
As
a
result
I
became
rather
isolated
for
a
while
and
this
is
when
I
started
keeping
a
journal
and
writing
a
little
bit
of
poetry
on
my
own.
The
poems
are
nothing
to
speak
of
and
the
journals
are
rather
mundane,
but
they
paint
a
good
picture
of
my
young
teenage
self.
There
was
something
about
writing
those
journals
that
made
me
feel
special
at
the
time,
like
the
writing
made
me
unique.
I
did
have
a
flair
for
the
dramatic
back
then,
perhaps
I
still
do.
The
journals
continued
through
high
school,
but
became
less
and
less
frequent
and
now
I
only
write
a
journal
about
once
every
six
months.
During
middle
school
I
also
dabbled
in
short
stories,
most
of
which
I
abandoned
in
their
infancy,
but
there
was
one
that
I
finished
and
eventually
showed
to
my
friends
in
eighth
grade.
They
were
surprised
to
find
out
that
I
wrote
and
generally
liked
it,
providing
comments
and
changes.
Boosted
by
the
favorable
response,
I
showed
the
story
to
my
English
teacher.
She
was
also
impressed
by
my
writing
outside
of
school
and
gave
me
lots
of
critiques
and
comments.
That
is
when
I
began
to
see
myself
as
a
good
writer
or
at
least
when
I
moved
past
a
phase
of
timidity.
I
had
finally
gained
confidence
in
my
abilities.
Although
I
remained
a
shy,
quiet
person,
the
words
I
wrote
no
longer
reflected
that.
In
terms
of
composition,
middle
school
was
a
step
back
from
my
Montessori
experience
as
there
were
many
more
mindless
projects
than
writing
assignments.
In
fact,
I
did
not
write
anything
else
of
interest
until
high
school.
My
ninth
grade
English
class
was
possibly
the
scariest
class
of
my
life
up
to
that
point,
because
that
was
when
I
met
the
in-class
essay.
It
was
only
the
second
or
third
day
back
at
school
when
we
had
an
essay
test
on
the
summer
reading.
The
teacher
did
give
us
a
one
day
warning,
but
that
didnOt
stop
me
from
being
terrified.
I
tried
to
write
some
notes
the
night
before
but
without
knowing
the
prompt
it
was
hard
to
do.
Luckily,
when
I
sat
down
the
next
morning
and
started
reading
the
question
I
was
calmed
and
ended
up
doing
a
decent
job,
except
for
the
fact
that
I
did
not
get
to
write
a
conclusion.
What
I
took
away
from
that
experience
is
that
I
need
time
to
think
if
I
am
going
to
write
something
that
I
feel
good
about;
something
that
I
always
keep
in
mind
nowadays
when
I
get
a
paper
assignment.
I
have
to
be
able
to
read
the
prompt
over
carefully
multiple
times,
write
notes,
sleep
on
it
for
a
night
and
then
get
down
to
composing
the
essay.
That
is
not
to
say
that
I
am
incapable
of
writing
when
the
clock
is
ticking,
but
I
do
not
have
confidence
in
what
I
produce
in
those
situations.
High
school
was
studded
with
many
essays
and
writing
assignments,
from
small
creative
bits
to
DBQs
for
AP
history
classes,
but
the
only
two
really
worth
discussing
are
my
eleventh
grade
English
term
paper
and
my
senior
government
paper.
Both
were
required
in
order
to
graduate
from
my
high
school
and,
for
students
in
the
honors
track,
each
one
had
to
be
twelve
to
fifteen
pages
long.
The
term
paper
was
a
literary
analysis
of
an
authorOs
work
based
on
reading
three
of
his/her
books.
This
paper
was
definitely
the
more
difficult
of
the
two
for
me
because
I
was
not
able
to
keep
myself
interested
and
the
note
taking
style
that
my
teacher
required
did
not
coincide
well
with
my
own
preferences.
My
author
was
Joyce
Carol
Oates,
whom
I
had
never
read
before,
but
her
novels
seemed
intriguing
after
my
preliminary
research.
After
reading
the
books,
I
decided
to
focus
on
the
female
characters
and
how
Oates
used
them
to
describe
a
womanOs
struggle
in
twentieth
century
America.
The
next
step
was
to
find
at
least
forty
sources
that
I
could
potentially
use
in
the
final
paper.
Once
I
was
able
to
track
down
that
many
unique
sources,
I
had
to
collect
about
two
hundred
quotes
from
them
and
put
each
one
on
a
separate
index
card.
This
was
the
part
that
I
struggled
with
the
most
because
I
hated
having
so
many
cards
to
keep
track
of
and
it
was
also
very
difficult
to
find
such
a
large
number
of
meaningful
quotes
without
repeating
information.
When
it
finally
came
down
to
writing
the
paper,
I
had
so
many
ideas
that
it
was
a
challenge
to
organize
them
into
something
coherent.
My
term
paper
is
not
the
most
beautifully
written
thing
I
have
ever
produced,
but
it
is
by
far
the
one
I
take
the
most
pride
in
just
because
I
persevered
and
finished
it.
For
that
reason
it
is
the
one
paper
from
high
school
of
which
I
have
kept
a
hard
copy.
The
senior
government
paper
was
probably
the
best
thing
that
I
wrote
in
high
school;
consequently,
it
was
also
the
last.
The
assignment
was
to
argue
for
or
against
an
issue
relating
to
United
States
policy
using
a
format
that
described
the
issueOs
past,
present
and
future.
I
chose
to
argue
for
the
sovereignty
of
Native
American
nations,
which
I
felt
was
unique
and
also
satisfied
my
desire
to
write
about
something
that
most
people
probably
do
not
think
about.
Finding
an
angle
was
easy
enough
as
the
US
government
has
committed
countless
atrocities
against
the
American
Indians
since
its
inception.
From
there
the
rest
of
my
paper
unfolded
easily,
not
only
because
I
had
a
volume
of
writing
experience
behind
me
but
because
I
felt
passionate
about
what
I
was
writing
and
was
truly
engaged
in
the
topic.
Nothing
beats
writing
under
those
conditions,
and
I
have
since
learned
to
always
try
to
find
the
motivating
angle
that
will
keep
me
writing
at
my
best.
When
I
arrived
at
Lafayette,
I
was
a
bit
nervous
about
college
level
writing
but
at
the
same
time
felt
prepared
to
handle
whatever
came
my
way.
Writing
is
not
something
that
I
worry
about
because
I
know
that
I
am
capable
and
that
help
is
always
there
if
I
need
a
little
push.
Sometimes
all
it
takes
to
get
a
paper
off
the
ground
is
to
bounce
ideas
off
someone
else
or
have
a
conversation
about
writing
strategy
and
direction.
My
FYS
professor
had
a
great
discussion
with
me
while
I
was
writing
my
final
paper
for
the
class.
She
told
me
that
I
was
a
good
writer
but
that
I
needed
to
take
more
risks
in
my
writing
and
go
further
with
analysis
in
order
to
really
say
something
profound.
Her
critiques
and
comments
made
me
think
a
lot
about
my
writing
and
how
I
could
change
and
improve.
Coming
out
of
a
semester
of
FYS,
I
did
feel
that
my
writing
in
the
spring
had
grown
already
allowing
me
to
tackle
some
very
difficult
anthropology
papers
with
success.
Another
form
of
composition
that
I
have
grown
more
accustomed
to
at
Lafayette
is
writing
in
Spanish.
In
high
school
I
did
write
a
few
short
papers
in
Spanish,
but
not
with
the
consistency
that
I
have
in
college.
I
have
learned
that
it
is
not
enough
to
think
in
English
and
then
try
and
translate
my
thoughts
into
Spanish
because
the
languages
have
different
ways
of
flowing
and
different
structure.
In
fact
some
ideas
literally
do
not
translate.
It
takes
me
a
long
time
to
write
in
Spanish
because
I
sort
of
have
to
retrain
my
brain
to
think
in
Spanish
every
time
I
sit
down
to
work
on
a
paper.
Luckily,
it
is
a
skill
that
becomes
easier
with
practice
and
perseverance,
because
literacy
in
Spanish
is
something
that
I
would
really
like
to
achieve.
Writing
about
myself
has
never
been
easy;
I
always
worry
about
coming
off
as
either
too
boastful
or
obnoxiously
humble.
My
journey
as
a
writer
has
taken
me
a
long
way
from
learning
the
alphabet
to
writing
in
two
languages,
but
it
has
not
yet
taken
me
past
the
milestone
where
I
feel
totally
comfortable
writing
my
own
story.
It
has
always
been
easier
for
me
to
deflect
and
listen
to
what
others
have
to
say
and
write
in
the
third
person.
I
want
to
be
able
to
grow
out
of
this
and
gain
confidence
in
all
forms
of
composition
by
the
time
I
graduate
from
Lafayette.
Then
I
will
feel
that
I
have
truly
accomplished
something
as
a
writer.
