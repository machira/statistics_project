A
Student
Teaching
Other
Students:
How
being
A
WA
Has
Helped
Me
Grow
As
A
Writer
Writing
has
always
been
a
passion
of
mine,
revising
not
so
much.
While
I
had
learned
the
importance
of
revising
my
work
during
the
college
application
process
(I
wrote
close
to
twelve
drafts
of
my
personal
essay),
the
concept
never
quite
stuck.
This
isnOt
to
say
that
I
did
not
casually
review
my
college
essay
for
errors;
I
just
didnOt
always
review
for
content.
Much
of
this
involved
a
sense
of
artistic
pride.
Trying
to
revise
a
piece
of
work
felt
like
a
personal
offense.
It
required
admitting
to
myself
that
my
writing
wasnOt
perfect
the
first
time
around.
It
took
a
few
BOs
and
last
yearOs
experience
as
a
writing
associate
to
finally
make
me
realize
that
revision
is
an
essential
part
of
any
form
of
writing.
When
I
experienced
my
first
round
of
WA
conferences
I
was
initially
really
nervous.
As
a
junior
I
felt
that
I
had
more
of
a
background
in
college
writing,
but
it
still
felt
like
I
was
an
imposter.
After
all,
I
was
just
a
college
student
just
like
them.
Once
I
got
accustomed
to
the
meetings,
I
began
to
feel
more
confident
in
my
ability
to
help
my
students.
Along
the
way,
I
learned
a
few
lessons
about
writing.
First
of
all,
I
learned
that
speaking
about
your
writing
can
be
helpful
when
developing
ideas.
Often,
when
individuals
write
it
is
rare
that
their
point
is
clear
on
the
first
try.
The
first
draft
of
an
essay
or
piece
of
work
is
almost
experimental
and
a
form
of
mental
catharsis.
The
goal
is
to
get
everything
down
on
paper.
When
I
write
my
first
draft,
I
am
thinking
of
ways
to
make
the
paper
properly
flow.
In
actuality,
I
find
myself
trying
to
write
down
every
point
or
concept
that
must
be
made
within
a
limited
amount
of
space.
As
a
result
my
first
drafts
can
come
out
to
be
very
disorganized
and
messy.
I
wasnOt
surprised
when
I
began
to
see
this
in
my
WA
students
as
well,
especially
when
they
were
told
beforehand
that
they
were
only
responsible
for
an
initial
draft.
I
found
that
students
took
full
advantage
of
this
situation
and
did
not
always
deliver
to
me
their
best
work.
Sometimes
I
viewed
this
as
students
being
too
busy
and
not
managing
their
time
efficiently
as
freshman.
Eventually
once
I
began
to
speak
with
the
students
they
began
to
open
up
about
their
reasons
for
not
having
a
good
first
draft.
Many
expressed
concern
about
where
to
begin
an
essay.
While
they
had
their
ideas
clearly
laid
out
in
their
minds,
they
just
could
not
find
a
way
to
begin
their
paper.
Other
students
did
not
know
where
their
idea
for
the
paper
was
headed.
Discussion
of
topic
ideas
became
a
very
useful
tool.
I
found
that
as
students
talked
about
their
ideas
and
fears
toward
writing
the
paper,
concepts
became
clearer.
This
was
especially
true
in
the
case
of
students
who
were
writing
papers
based
on
topics
which
I
had
never
encountered.
Since
I
was
unfamiliar
with
the
idea,
students
felt
the
need
to
explain
the
concept.
Through
this
explanation
they
came
to
better
understand
what
exactly
it
was
that
they
were
trying
to
say.
It
always
created
a
good
feeling
for
me
when
I
saw
a
smile
light
up
a
studentOs
face
when
they
came
to
an
understanding.
It
made
me
feel
as
if
I
was
actually
making
a
difference
and
it
is
what
I
find
to
be
a
therapeutic
experience
for
both
the
student
as
well
as
the
writing
associate.
This
experience
with
my
students
led
to
a
personal
growth
in
my
own
writing.
Because
I
found
speaking
about
an
idea
to
be
so
beneficial
with
my
students,
I
decided
to
try
it
for
my
own
papers.
At
the
time
I
was
taking
a
course
on
MiltonOs
Paradise
Lost
with
a
professor
that
I
respect
very
much.
While
I
had
taken
courses
before
with
this
professor,
this
one
proved
particularly
challenging
due
to
the
complexity
of
the
text.
For
my
final
paper
I
was
to
find
a
real
world
representation
of
Paradise
Lost
in
our
culture
today.
I
wanted
to
write
my
paper
on
Neil
GaimanOs
The
Sandman,
a
volume
of
comic
books
where
the
character
of
Lucifer
makes
quite
a
few
appearances.
Coming
up
with
a
clear
thesis
was
almost
impossible
without
sounding
like
I
was
merely
comparing
two
artistic
concepts
of
Satan.
I
had
all
my
main
points
organized
into
an
outline,
but
no
thesis.
At
this
point
of
high
stress,
I
decided
to
consult
with
my
roommate
who
is
also
a
writing
associate.
She
happened
to
be
taking
the
course
with
me
so
we
decided
to
help
each
other
by
talking
out
our
ideas.
Her
pop
culture
reference
for
Paradise
Lost
was
one
I
had
never
read
and
she
had
never
personally
read
The
Sandman.
For
this
reason
we
both
had
to
explain
in
further
detail
our
ideas.
After
close
to
an
hour
of
discussion
we
were
both
able
to
compile
a
functioning
thesis
for
our
papers.
It
was
also
helpful
that
for
this
course
we
were
to
present
our
ideas
to
the
class
in
order
to
get
our
classmateOs
opinions.
This
experience
helped
me
realize
just
how
essential
it
is
to
brainstorm
beforehand.
Writing
this
paper
gave
me
a
new
way
to
approach
writing,
but
it
also
allowed
me
to
recognize
how
much
of
a
contribution
I
was
making
to
my
students
as
a
writing
associate.
Another
climatic
point
in
my
development
as
a
writer
and
writing
associate
involved
my
advanced
creative
writing
course.
This
course
focused
solely
on
poetry
writing
(a
long
lived
passion
of
mine)
and
finished
with
a
portfolio
which
was
worth
seventy
five
percent
of
my
final
grade.
Poetry
writing
tends
to
be
different
from
academic
writing
and
is
an
art
where
creativity
is
necessary.
My
professor
focused
solely
on
the
final
work
I
demonstrated
in
my
portfolio,
but
she
also
collected
all
drafts
of
the
poems
I
had
written.
This
course
forced
me
to
adjust
to
the
concept
of
revision.
When
I
initially
wrote
a
poem,
I
felt
positive
that
this
was
the
way
that
I
wanted
it
to
flow.
For
my
course,
however,
I
was
responsible
for
bringing
one
poem
into
class
every
week
for
workshop.
During
workshop
I
would
have
to
read
my
poem
out
loud
to
the
class
and
I
would
also
hand
out
drafts
of
my
poem
to
my
classmates
and
professor.
After
my
reading,
the
class
would
be
allotted
five
to
ten
minutes
to
make
suggestions
on
the
draft
they
were
given.
I
then
picked
on
my
classmates
and
they
expressed
their
opinions
about
my
work.
I
took
notes
which
I
later
utilized
to
revise.
These
workshops
allowed
me
to
get
the
feedback
of
the
reader,
not
just
my
personal
opinion.
I
ended
up
revising
many
of
my
poems
five
or
even
six
times.
With
every
revision
the
poem
took
on
a
new
format.
By
the
end
of
the
process,
the
first
draft
looked
entirely
different
from
the
final
draft.
I
would
have
not
been
able
to
accomplish
these
revisions
without
the
feedback
of
my
classmates.
The
readerOs
opinion
becomes
necessary
in
order
to
make
a
good
revision
or
just
as
a
way
of
assuring
that
everything
makes
sense.
This
came
to
be
very
useful
when
I
was
conducting
meetings
with
my
students.
Many
times
students
would
have
completed
drafts,
but
felt
insecure
about
the
rhythm
of
the
paper.
They
often
questioned
whether
it
was
captivating
or
easy
to
read.
As
a
writing
associate
I
was
trained
to
prompt
the
student
to
answering
his
or
her
own
questions
about
their
paper.
It
was
baffling
when
a
student
would
ask:
NwhatOs
your
opinion,
honestly?O
I
then
had
a
dilemma
in
my
hands.
I
was
unsure
whether
I
should
actually
provide
direct
feedback
or
if
I
should
divert
the
student
away
from
the
question
and
focus
on
specific
parts
of
the
paper.
While
my
training
would
have
advised
me
to
force
the
student
to
figure
out
his
or
her
own
problem
areas
in
writing,
in
some
cases
I
decided
to
do
just
the
opposite.
I
would
try
to
incorporate
parts
of
my
training
by
first
honestly
answering
the
question.
If
the
paper
did
not
flow
well
I
would
simply
say,
Nyour
paper
does
not
flow
well
in
some
areas,
why
do
you
think
that
is?O
In
this
way
the
student
is
aware
of
my
opinion
as
the
reader,
but
he
or
she
also
has
the
opportunity
to
explain
the
process
they
chose
for
writing
the
paper
and
the
obstacles
that
they
faced.
Often,
the
issue
of
clarity
had
other
underlying
roots
that
were
hidden
to
both
the
student
as
well
as
the
writing
associate.
When
discussing
papers
with
students
many
of
them
also
encountered
issues
with
the
concept
of
NpersonalizingO
their
paper.
Personalization
can
best
be
defined
as
adding
your
own
experiences
to
a
piece
of
writing.
The
issue
with
the
essay,
however,
is
that
it
is
a
form
of
very
formal
writing
where
students
are
expected
to
follow
certain
guidelines
as
directed
by
the
professor.
For
my
last
WA
class,
the
students
had
to
write
papers
concerning
the
topic
of
gender.
In
these
essays
they
were
to
incorporate
the
knowledge
they
had
gathered
from
classroom
discussion
and
texts
with
personal
experiences
dealing
with
gender.
One
of
the
first
frustrations
which
students
encountered
was
speaking
about
gender
from
a
personal
level.
Some
students
were
able
to
easily
quote
huge
chunks
of
information
from
the
text,
but
could
not
explain
what
it
was
that
they
were
citing.
Others
could
talk
about
personal
experience,
but
did
not
include
enough
information
they
had
received
in
class.
Striking
a
balance
was
difficult.
My
students
panicked
when
speaking
to
me,
expressing
concern
that
they
did
not
know
how
to
make
the
paper
their
own.
The
common
response
was
NI
donOt
know
what
to
do
with
this,
I
mean
I
have
no
experience
with
this
topic.O
The
solution
always
revolved
around
the
classroom
and
the
prompt.
It
is
hard
for
students
to
remember
to
reread
the
prompt.
Many
consider
it
a
slap
in
the
face
when
I
ask
them
to
do
this
in
front
of
me,
but
in
my
past
experience
I
have
found
that
a
simple
rereading
of
the
prompt
helps
students
put
their
paper
in
context
of
the
class.
While
itOs
easier
to
talk
to
my
students
about
rereading
the
assignment
in
order
to
personalize
a
paper,
it
is
something
that
I
often
forget
myself.
Through
my
experience
as
a
WA
for
this
gender
course,
I
was
able
to
get
a
better
grasp
of
the
process
of
personalizing
a
paper
and
how
to
do
it
properly.
I
learned
and
taught
my
students
that
relating
personal
experience
to
examples
in
the
text
is
only
one
of
the
many
approaches
that
works
when
writing
this
form
of
paper.
Since
all
of
the
assignments
for
this
course
involved
this
kind
of
writing,
it
became
easier
to
mark
the
progress
that
students
were
making
as
the
course
continued.
It
also
became
easier
to
figure
out
how
every
student
functioned.
Perhaps
one
of
the
most
important
lessons
for
me
as
a
WA
has
been
recognizing
that
every
student
is
different
and
that
each
individual
has
their
own
internal
measure
of
commitment
and
success
when
taking
a
course.
For
one
of
my
WA
classes,
my
professor
allowed
me
to
see
the
grades
which
students
had
received
for
their
papers
once
meetings
were
over.
We
would
then
sit
together
and
discuss
what
can
be
done
to
improve
this
studentOs
writing.
While
I
felt
extremely
honored
that
my
professor
confided
this
deeply
personal
information
with
me,
I
also
felt
a
sense
of
concern
for
my
students.
Knowing
how
each
one
was
doing
for
the
course,
I
felt
a
higher
sense
of
responsibility
to
urge
them
to
do
better.
It
became
frustrating
when
a
student
that
I
knew
was
struggling
would
not
put
in
enough
effort.
When
many
of
the
grades
did
not
budge
and
my
professor
was
confused,
I
sometimes
wondered
if
it
was
something
that
I
wasnOt
doing
during
my
meetings.
Consulting
with
my
professor
helped
with
these
feelings
and
helped
me
better
cope
with
the
situation.
I
remember
my
professor
telling
me
Nyou
have
to
remember,
you
canOt
care
more
for
their
grade
and
writing
more
than
they
do.O
It
was
then
that
I
felt
that
I
was
doing
something
right
and
when
I
realized
the
attachment
that
a
WA
can
develop
to
his
or
her
students.
It
was
an
amazing
feeling
when
I
could
finally
recognize
that
I
contributed
to
the
progress
of
my
students.
Being
able
to
see
my
studentOs
grades
turned
out
to
be
a
relief
and
evoked
a
sense
of
accomplishment
when
I
saw
that
a
student
that
was
really
trying
was
finally
able
to
improve
their
writing.
Nothing
could
defeat
the
feeling
I
got
when
a
student
came
up
to
me
and
said
thank
you
so
much
for
all
of
your
help,
I
did
so
well
for
that
paper.
I
still
see
many
of
my
students,
and
many
of
them
still
remember
me
and
ask
me
for
advice
about
college
and
courses
in
general.
For
this
reason
I
took
on
the
internship
that
I
did
for
the
summer.
This
summer
I
worked
for
a
nonprofit
organization
called
Row
New
York.
The
goal
of
the
organization
is
to
promote
excellence
in
young
women
through
the
sport
of
rowing.
The
organization
provides
academic
tutoring
and
help
with
writing
to
a
group
of
young
women.
The
girls
also
row
with
the
program
and
compete
with
other
schools.
Many
go
on
to
college
with
full
scholarships
for
rowing.
Even
though
I
was
hired
as
an
Academic
Intern,
I
ended
up
doing
something
entirely
different.
One
of
my
tasks
involved
compiling
and
organizing
the
first
ten
pages
of
an
agenda
that
would
be
printed
for
the
girls
to
utilize.
This
was
a
new
form
of
writing
where
I
was
forced
to
quickly
determine
which
information
was
useful
and
which
information
was
unnecessary
to
print.
It
took
weeks
of
revision,
sweat,
blood,
and
tears.
When
it
was
finally
finished
and
I
got
the
thumbs
up
from
my
supervisor
I
was
completely
elated.
I
felt
like
I
had
accomplished
something,
but
I
still
felt
unsatisfied
because
I
did
not
get
a
chance
to
interact
enough
with
the
students.
As
a
result
I
realized
just
how
much
I
wanted
to
work
with
teenagers
in
the
future.
I
am
looking
forward
to
growing
more
as
a
writer
in
my
final
year
in
college,
especially
since
I
am
taking
on
a
thesis.
Most
importantly,
however,
I
am
looking
forward
to
growing
through
the
work
of
my
WA
students
and
their
personal
development.
I
consider
it
to
be
an
essential
part
of
my
development
in
the
year
to
come.
Being
a
WA
isnOt
about
having
a
job,
itOs
about
being
a
teacher.
This
means
not
only
sharing
knowledge
with
others
who
know
less,
but
learning
from
these
individuals
how
to
give
more.
While
it
may
not
be
physically
tangible,
what
you
receive
back
is
priceless.
