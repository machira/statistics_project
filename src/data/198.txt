Literacy
Narrative
Writing
is
an
essential
form
of
communication,
allowing
thought
to
spread
over
both
distance
and
time.
Its
power
is
immeasurable;
people
are
more
willing
to
believe
what
they
see
in
print
than
what
they
hear.
That
such
a
medium
should
be
formed
from
simple
combinations
of
consonants
and
vowels
is
unbelievable.
As
a
kindergartner
printing
the
alphabet
in
my
backyard,
I
seemed
to
sense
this.
Not
in
such
expansive
terms,
naturally,
but
I
knew
what
I
was
creating
on
paper
was
somehow
important.
The
idea
that
letters
interacted
to
form
words
was
not
foreign
to
me,
and
I
quickly
learned
how
to
read,
speeding
through
countless
S.R.A.
story
cards.
As
we
practiced
printing,
I
was
bored.
It
seemed
unoriginal
to
copy
silly
sentences
from
the
board.
I
understood
we
were
practicing
letters,
but
I
also
sensed
there
was
a
greater
power
in
what
I
was
writing
than
how
I
was
using
it.
Third
grade
particularly
sticks
out
in
my
memory
as
an
important
point
in
my
writing.
In
that
year,
we
made
large
picture
books
with
some
captions.
As
I
was
an
avid
reader
by
this
time,
I
knew
that
my
favorite
stories
were
mysteries,
and
I
set
out
to
create
a
story
about
a
stolen
red
bird.
The
requirements
of
the
assignment
did
not
matter;
my
story
would
be
as
long
as
necessary
to
say
that
there
was
a
bird
that
was
stolen
and
the
perpetrator
unknown.
To
help
us
with
vocabulary,
the
teacher
assigned
spelling
words
that
we
had
to
use
in
sentences.
Writing
twenty
sentences
to
show
proficiency
at
individual
definitions
was
as
simplistic
as
handing
out
a
single
pencil
to
every
person
in
a
room,
so
I
decided
to
attempt
something
more
challenging,
combining
as
many
words
as
possible
into
a
single,
meaningful
sentence.
The
activity
was
a
game
to
me,
quite
enjoyable
but
with
an
unpredictable
ending.
Seeing
my
quick
mastery
of
spelling
words,
the
teacher
asked
me
to
teach
a
Spanish-speaking
student
in
our
class
English.
I
worked
with
the
boy
every
day,
making
posters
with
pictures
and
written
words
beneath
them.
My
duty
was
to
combine
meaning,
look,
and
sound
to
a
student
to
whom
the
ideas
were
foreign.
I
was
eager
for
the
task.
I
excelled
in
the
early
years
of
elementary
school
and
transferred
to
a
special
talented
and
gifted
class
in
fourth
grade.
In
this
class,
part
of
nearly
each
day
was
devoted
to
"Writer's
Workshop,"
time
where
we
would
work
on
a
creative
writing
project
and
have
the
opportunity
to
read
it
to
class
for
constructive
criticism.
Now
regularly
reading
books
separated
by
chapters,
I
ventured
to
write
my
own
novel.
Again,
the
focus
of
my
writing
was
mystery,
but
here
I
encountered
new
difficulties.
I
realized
the
importance
of
character
development
and
wanted
to
give
the
reader
a
full
perspective
into
the
lives
of
my
characters.
In
so
doing,
I
would
had
countless
unnecessary
characters,
such
as
so-and-so's
boss,
and
the
lady
who
lived
next
door
but
got
sick
and
needed
some
chicken
soup.
Although
ambitious,
the
number
of
characters
was
astounding
and
created
a
task
much
larger
than
I
could
handle.
The
problem
frustrated
me,
as
I
knew
what
I
was
doing
was
improper,
but
I
couldn't
figure
out
how
to
segregate
important
minor
characters
from
those
who
did
not
need
any
development,
if
even
mention.
Because
I
struggled
with
this
idea,
I
would
spend
months
on
each
"chapter."
My
problems
and
frustrations
with
creative
writing
did
not
end
there,
however.
I
quickly
realized
that
most
of
my
writing
had
the
same
style
as
the
book
that
I
had
most
recently
enjoyed.
Though
perhaps
a
good
starting
point,
I
was
aggravated
that
my
writing
felt
so
similar
to
someone
else's.
I
had
begun
to
develop
an
idea
about
ownership
and
individuality
in
writing
and
saw
these
things
as
lacking
in
my
own
style;
my
writing
did
not
feel
like
it
belonged
to
me.
When
I
reached
middle
school,
writing
was
simply
a
necessary
task,
not
something
difficult
or
exciting,
but
something
I
did
when
it
was
required.
I
did
not
write
much
on
my
own,
but
went
to
great
lengths
to
perfect
any
assignment
I
was
given.
These
I
enjoyed,
for
they
were
a
combination
of
reading
comprehension
and
creative
writing.
A
letter
written
from
one
character
to
another
regarding
one's
feelings
about
the
plot
was
one
such
example.
In
this
type
of
writing,
I
felt
I
had
enough
framework
to
produce
something
of
quality
and
substance,
while
ensuring
that
what
I
wrote
was
uniquely
mine,
not
a
copycat
of
some
favorite
author's
work.
By
the
end
of
the
year,
writing
was
not
just
necessary;
it
was
interesting
again.
My
reading
teacher
in
particular
thought
I
developed
talent
in
my
composition
and
allowed
me
to
keep
a
textbook
of
ideas
for
starting
essays
and
creative
work
at
the
end
of
the
year.
My
seventh
grade
English
teacher,
Mr.
Mullin,
mostly
was
responsible
for
teaching
grammar.
However,
he
was
a
man
of
discipline
and
expected
the
class
to
act
properly
and
be
prepared
each
day.
If
these
things
did
not
happen,
he
would
take
points
off
the
offender's
average.
By
writing
an
essay
with
one
hundred
times
as
many
words
as
points
lost,
one
could
regain
these
points.
Mr.
Mullin
assigned
the
topic
for
the
writing
to
make
the
task
more
difficult.
Rather
than
seeing
this
assignment
as
a
punishment,
I
thought
the
task
was
interesting.
After
all,
how
often
does
one
write
a
five
hundred-word
essay,
something
seventh
graders
perceive
as
lengthy,
on
the
art
of
book
covering?
When
I
forgot
my
spelling
book
on
"spelling
day,"
it
became
my
turn
to
lose
five
points.
Immediately,
I
asked
what
topic
I
should
use
for
a
point-redeeming
essay.
His
answer
was
paper.
Five
hundred
words
on
paper
seemed
a
bit
much
for
such
a
simplistic
topic,
so
I
decided
I
had
to
research
the
topic.
When
I
got
home
that
evening,
I
dragged
out
an
encyclopedia
and
began
reading
about
the
art
of
papermaking,
the
different
types
of
paper,
and
the
wide
spread
use
of
the
medium.
It
was
far
more
interesting
and
involved
than
I
had
first
thought.
Suddenly,
five
hundred
words
did
not
seem
long
enough.
When
I
was
satisfied
that
my
essay
was
complete
and
thorough,
it
was
over
fifteen
hundred
words
long.
I
eagerly
handed
in
the
paper
the
next
day,
and
Mr.
Mullin,
impressed
by
my
effort
and
writing,
returned
my
five
lost
points
and
awarded
me
ten
extra
for
the
added
length.
By
the
time
I
was
in
eighth
grade,
most
of
my
teachers
were
fairly
impressed
and
appreciative
of
my
writing
talent.
I
felt
equally
adept
at
writing
essays
as
I
did
writing
creatively.
I
no
longer
mimicked
the
style
of
books
I
read,
but
wrote
as
I
thought
was
appropriate
to
the
assignment.
Though
the
majority
of
my
writing
was
handwritten,
I
also
enjoyed
using
a
typewriter
I
was
given
as
a
Christmas
present.
The
electronic
typing
seemed
more
efficient
and
neater
to
me
than
that
produced
by
hand,
and
I
used
it
far
more
often
than
most
of
my
peers
throughout
middle
school.
I
enjoyed
writing,
and
all
my
teachers
assured
me
I
was
ready
for
high
school.
I
took
the
most
challenging
course-load
I
could
in
high
school,
beginning
with
Honors
English.
Now
the
culture
shock
hit.
From
my
middle
school
experiences,
I
felt
confident
in
my
abilities
as
a
writer.
Most
of
my
teachers
agreed,
and
I
got
high
marks
on
all
my
writings
in
History
and
Science
courses,
writing
with
a
greater
complexity
in
Spanish
than
necessary.
In
English,
however,
it
seemed
I
could
not
produce
a
piece
of
writing
pleasing
to
my
teacher.
She
pointed
out
an
overuse
of
the
passive
voice,
something
I
thought
was
part
of
my
writing
style
and
legitimate.
My
text
was
not
developed
enough
for
her
likes,
and
my
style
was
too
childish.
I
fought
her
criticism
for
the
first
several
months
of
school,
convinced
she
graded
too
hard
and
that
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
doing.
After
all,
no
one
else
had
ever
complained
about
my
writing;
she
was
a
rare
exception.
It
did
not
take
long
for
me
to
become
weary
of
80s
on
my
essays,
however.
It
seemed
English
was
my
most
challenging
course
and
was
hurting
my
average
the
most.
Rather
than
continuing
my
rebellious
attitude,
I
decided
I
needed
to
cater
to
my
teacher's
tastes.
I
began
changing
my
writing
format,
breaking
away
from
the
five-paragraph
development
method,
and
became
more
conscious
of
my
errors
in
writing.
Proofreading
became
more
important,
and
my
overconfidence
faded.
By
the
end
of
the
year,
I
was
receiving
hard-earned
A's
on
my
papers,
and
my
writing
skipped
up
to
the
next
level.
Another
advance
at
the
start
of
high
school
was
the
use
of
a
computer.
This
new
device
was
much
simpler
to
use
than
the
typewriter
had
been
and
allowed
be
to
skip
around
within
text
to
errors
or
areas
that
needed
improvement,
rather
than
scanning
through
a
one-line
LCD
display.
I
could
easily
move
text
from
spot
to
another,
and
I
did
not
need
to
print
an
entire
document
to
correct
a
single
spelling
error.
My
ease
of
writing
improved,
and
I
quickly
mastered
word
processing
and
spreadsheet
programs,
skills
that
saved
me
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
for
years
afterward.
My
sophomore
year
marked
the
first
where
serious
papers
were
assigned.
I
had
begun
writing
term
papers
in
eighth
or
ninth
grade,
but
tenth
grade
was
the
first
time
where
we
had
more
than
one
in-depth
paper
that
required
research.
Researching
a
topic
provided
no
difficulty
for
me;
the
introduction
of
the
paper
was
a
roadblock.
I
had
trouble
starting
my
paper
without
funneling,
a
technique
I
used
throughout
elementary
school
of
beginning
with
a
broad
base
and
moving
toward
the
specific
topic
of
the
paper,
and
it
bothered
me
to
start
mid-paper
and
return
to
the
introduction
later.
A
pattern
of
procrastination
also
showed
itself
as
being
well
developed.
The
combination
of
these
two
undesirables
caused
many
late
nights
as
I
struggled
to
perfect
my
writing.
Still,
I
could
not
bear
to
hand
in
anything
less
than
my
best,
and
I
worked
until
I
was
satisfied.
1
participated
in
a
summer
program
at
Stevens
Institute
of
Technology
the
summer
after
my
sophomore
year.
Though
I
was
a
strong
writer
overall,
my
real
love
was
in
the
math
and
sciences.
The
Stevens
program
provided
an
opportunity
to
learn
about
engineering,
something
that
seemed
perfect
for
my
likes.
There
was
an
overview
to
several
different
fields
of
engineering
and
physics,
but
each
participant
chose
a
specialty
to
explore.
Within
this
specialty,
there
was
a
project
and
a
report
to
be
completed
by
the
conclusion
of
the
two-week
program.
This
report
was
my
first
attempt
at
a
technical
paper.
With
a
partner,
I
fabricated
a
solar
cell
and
reported
on
the
workings
and
testing
of
the
device.
Our
paper
was
well
received,
and
we
were
chosen
to
present
our
work
to
a
group
of
parents,
students,
and
families.
In
addition
to
teaching
me
about
engineering
and
writing
a
technical
paper,
the
experience
taught
me
about
the
dangers
of
procrastination.
Because
of
circumstances,
it
was
impossible
for
my
partner
and
me
to
use
a
computer
until
the
day
before
the
assignment
was
due.
We
spent
the
full
day
in
a
computer
lab,
frantically
typing
and
trying
to
import
charts
and
graphics
into
a
text
file.
When
the
lab
closed,
we
had
nearly
all
our
text
complete,
but
nothing
printed.
This
experience
convinced
me
that
I
should
never
wait
until
the
last
minute
to
undertake
such
a
vast
project.
The
promise
I
made
to
myself,
however,
was
soon
broken.
Of
all
the
classes
I
took
in
high
school,
the
one
that
best
prepared
me
for
college
writing
was
my
senior
year
AP
English
class.
To
say
my
teacher,
Mrs.
Stalbaum
was
demanding
was
an
understatement
in
the
extreme.
Essays
were
regular
assignments,
and
there
was
a
large
emphasis
on
reading.
The
difficult
part
of
Mrs.
Stalbaum's
class
was
not
the
amount
of
work
assigned,
however;
it
was
her
fierce
red
pen.
From
the
first
day,
Mrs.
Stalbaum
warned
the
class
that
she
did
not
tolerate
basic
errors
like
using
first
person
in
formal
writing,
run-ons,
fragments,
or
contractions.
Such
an
infringement
was
punished
with
an
"automatic
grade
of
50"
for
the
grammar
portion
of
the
paper.
Fear
successfully
implanted
in
the
class,
I
made
sure
to
reread
every
assignment
before
I
submitted
it.
More
so,
I
had
a
tremendous
desire
to
succeed
in
the
class,
and
tried
to
make
every
submission
better
than
I
first
thought
I
could.
In
one
such
essay,
I
went
back
to
correct
a
flow
error
in
my
paper,
removing
a
word,
but
overlooking
a
comma
that
made
my
carefully
constructed
sentence
a
fragment.
When
I
received
the
graded
paper,
tears
welded
in
my
eyes.
I
received
a
high
score
for
content,
but
a
large
red
fifty
marked
my
grammar
grade.
Though
the
shock
was
great
for
me,
I
learned
a
valuable
lesson
in
proofreading.
Typically,
I
wrote
only
one
draft
of
a
paper
and
edited
while
I
wrote,
using
only
grammar
check
to
review
my
work
before
printing
it.
That
one
assignment
taught
me
the
error
of
a
rushed,
incomplete
reread.
Mrs.
Stalbaum
also
helped
me
improve
my
writing,
by
working
with
me
on
the
overuse
of
the
passive
voice.
At
the
start
of
my
senior
year,
roughly
25
percent
of
my
sentences
would
use
a
passive
verb.
By
graduation,
nearly
every
paper
I
wrote
used
the
tense
less
than
ten
percent
of
the
time.
The
change
was
difficult
for
me,
as
I
tended
to
think
and
reason
in
the
passive
voice
and
did
not
understand
what
was
so
troublesome
about
it.
After
some
work,
however,
I
was
able
to
avoid
the
use
of
the
voice,
or
at
least
correct
most
sentences
I
wrote
in
passive
voice
in
my
first
draft.
When
I
finished
the
AP
English
course,
I
felt
well
prepared
for
college
and
the
advanced
placement
test.
Because
of
my
self-improvement
efforts
in
my
senior
year,
I
was
the
only
student
from
my
large
high
school
to
receive
a
"five"
on
the
placement
test.
Beginning
college
as
an
engineer,
I
had
few
classes
that
required
me
to
write.
In
chemistry,
I
had
lab
reports
due
every
week,
but
I
did
not
see
these
as
much
of
a
challenge,
just
a
different
type
of
essay.
My
first
year
seminar,
however,
was
a
completely
different
experience.
This
class
was
entitled
"Wild
Imaginings:
The
Creative
Process."
The
title
intrigued
me
and
I
thought
the
course
would
emphasize
reading
and
discussion.
The
true
mature
of
the
course,
however,
was
creative
writing.
When
I
first
discovered
this,
I
was
not
very
concerned.
After
all,
I
enjoyed
creative
writing
when
I
did
it
in
elementary
school
and
I
had
taken
a
weekend
course
on
writing
mysteries,
fantasy,
and
suspense
as
a
seventh
grader.
Then
the
realization
that
I
had
not
done
anything
but
expository
and
persuasive
writing
since
middle
school
hit
me.
Creative
writing
was
not
as
simple
as
rambling
incoherently,
and
this
seemed
all
I
remembered.
I
found
the
work
challenging,
which
I
enjoyed,
and
for
one
of
the
first
times
since
I
began
school,
I
felt
a
grade
of
a
"B+"
was
actually
quite
a
reward.
The
course
gave
me
a
break
from
my
heavy
science
and
math
course
load,
while
renewing
my
interest
in
reading
and
writing.
An
interim
course
I
took
during
my
sophomore
year
reminded
me
of
my
AP
English
class
in
format.
The
essays
we
had
to
write
for
the
class
were
similar
to
the
caliber
of
material
necessary
to
succeed
in
my
high
school
class,
elevated
to
a
college
level.
Meetings
with
our
professors
before
I
began
writing
helped
me
to
organize
my
ideas
and
narrow
down
or
broaden
my
topic,
depending
what
was
necessary.
The
greatest
challenge
to
me
in
this
class,
however,
was
not
simply
writing
the
lengthy
papers;
it
was
doing
this
task
without
a
computer.
I
had
not
handwritten
anything
for
several
years,
particularly
a
final
draft.
Being
without
a
computer,
however,
I
relearned
editing
and
proofreading
skills
without
any
use
of
a
grammar
check.
My
next
heavy
writing
course
was
not
until
second
semester
of
my
sophomore
year,
when
I
took
Engineering
Ethics.
This
class
demanded
much
time
and
a
large
amount
of
writing,
but
I
rediscovered
that
I
was
skilled
at
this
latter
task.
A
three-page
essay
seemed
like
nothing
to
me,
in
fact,
I
often
found
it
too
short
for
full
elaboration
on
my
ideas.
My
professor
consistently
gave
me
positive
responses
to
my
writings,
and
meetings
with
my
writing
associate
seemed
very
productive,
more
so
than
in
my
first
year
seminar.
Though
I
could
not
point
out
specific
skills
I
developed
from
the
course,
I
am
certain
that
the
amount
of
practice
it
gave
me
in
writing
helped
my
style
overall
and
enlightened
me
to
what
was
expected
from
an
engineering
paper.
Today,
I
believe
my
writing
style
is
well
developed
and
that
I
am
competent
in
writing
and
grammar
skills.
However,
I
acknowledge
that
my
writing
is
not
near
perfect.
I
still
am
hurt
by
my
tendency
to
procrastinate,
something
that
often
cuts
down
on
the
time
I
need
to
do
a
thorough
job
on
a
writing
task.
In
addition,
I
continue
to
use
some
degree
of
funneling
in
my
introductions,
a
practice
that
often
makes
my
papers
long-winded.
The
tendency
to
use
the
passive
voice
also
persists,
but
I
have
significantly
backed
away
from
this
habit.
More
positively,
I
find
that
my
writing
typically
has
a
well-developed
thesis,
with
attention
given
to
most
details.
I
also
believe
that
I
write
clearly
and
present
ideas
to
my
audience.
I
have
received
much
support
and
attention
from
my
teachers
and
peers,
allowing
me
continually
to
improve
my
writing.
As
with
most
skills,
however,
writing
never
seems
to
reach
perfection,
and
I
find
that
I
have
many
grounds
on
which
to
improve.
