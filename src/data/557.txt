HISTORY
AS
A
WRITER
As
I
was
attempting
to
remember
my
first
act
of
writing,
I
began
to
ponder
what
it
is
that
makes
me
a
writer
to
begin
with.
I
started
to
think
of
everyday
activities
that
could
possibly
define
what
it
is
to
be
a
writer.
It
was
then
that
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
several
books
I
had
just
bought
from
Barnes
&
Noble
the
day
before.
I
had
gone
there
with
no
particular
book
in
mind,
yet
walked
out
with
four
very
different
books
to
keep
me
occupied
for
a
while.
It
was
then
that
I
realized
that
generally
speaking,
so
far
most
of
my
experience
with
writing
is
largely
influenced
by
what
I
read.
Although
I
have
a
poor
and
sometimes
selective
memory,
one
of
my
earliest
acts
of
academic
writing
seems
to
support
this
idea.
The
earliest
vivid
memory
I
have
of
writing
is
the
summer
going
into
the
6th
grade.
Students
were
responsible
for
writing
several
book
reports
on
books
chosen
from
a
list
of
summer
reading.
Perhaps
I
remember
this
act
because
it
is
also
one
of
the
first
times
I
remember
receiving
positive
feedback
about
something
I
had
written.
At
the
time
I
only
thought
of
the
assignment
as
just
that,
something
that
had
to
be
completed
by
the
first
day
of
school.
However,
the
day
my
English
teacher
walked
past
me
while
I
was
waiting
for
my
mother
to
pick
me
up
from
school
and
said
that
she
was
impressed
by
what
a
good
job
I
had
done
on
the
reports,
it
occurred
to
me
that
writing
could
be
more
than
just
assignments.
I
liked
how
it
felt
to
be
proud
of
something
I
had
written.
Somehow,
I
believe
this
feeling
is
what
drove
me
to
always
strive
harder
in
anything
that
involved
writing.
At
that
point
in
my
life
I
did
not
realize
the
large
role
that
writing
plays
in
any
and
possibly
every
academic
subject.
I
equated
only
my
English
class
and
other
humanities
courses
with
reading
and
writing,
not
realizing
the
fundamental
part
writing
would
play
in
subjects
such
as
Science.
I
never
realized
the
importance
of
structure
and
attention
to
detail
that
is
required
when
writing
a
lab
report
until
I
started
college.
Lab
reports
were
quite
foreign
to
me
in
high
school
and
I
quickly
learned
that
simply
including
the
correct
information
does
not
necessarily
make
a
good
lab
report.
I
have
learned
that
grammar
and
structure
is
just
as
important
when
writing
a
paper
for
an
English
class
as
it
is
when
writing
a
lab
report
or
any
other
type
of
academic
paper.
Although
I
took
AP
English
in
high
school
and
felt
that
I
was
Nadequately
preparedO
for
college
writing,
I
was
still
surprised
during
my
first
few
FYS
classes.
I
mostly
felt
that
I
was
adequately
prepared
because
I
received
good
grades
and
positive
feedback
from
my
teachers
and
felt
comfortable
with
my
writing.
I
knew
that
I
was
capable
of
producing
a
well-written
piece
and
that
I
could
follow
through
with
my
thesis
and
support
it.
I
quickly
realized
that
the
difference
was
that
expectations
and
assignments
were
more
clearly
defined
in
my
high
school
courses.
I
also
realized
that
outside
information,
such
as
history
and
current
events,
is
just
as
important
in
writing
a
paper
as
the
main
topic
or
novel
being
written
about.
Although
I
still
felt
comfortable
with
my
writing
abilities
I
knew
that
I
would
have
to
work
harder
to
make
the
same
grades
I
did
in
high
school
and
feel
just
as
proud
of
my
writing.
College
has
also
made
me
much
more
aware
of
my
own
writing
style
and
habits.
While
writing
essays
for
English
courses
in
college,
I
always
try
to
read
and
find
outside
information
that
pertains
to
my
thesis
in
the
hopes
that
it
will
strengthen
my
argument
and
paper
as
a
whole.
I
have
also
only
recently
gotten
in
the
habit
of
writing
outlines
for
academic
papers.
Although
writing
to
write
may
seem
like
a
strange
concept,
I
have
definitely
seen
the
advantage
of
creating
an
outline
first.
It
helps
me
organize
my
thoughts
and
saves
time
when
I
actually
start
to
write
a
paper.
Ever
since
one
of
my
English
professors
pointed
out
that
wanting
to
write
and
thinking
about
writing
is
very
different
from
actually
writing,
I
have
realized
how
important
the
first
step
of
writing
the
first
few
lines
is.
This
same
professor
taught
my
college
writing
course,
creative
writing.
Joining
that
class
was
one
of
the
first
times
I
realized
that
I
could
enjoy
writing
for
an
academic
class
and
recognized
my
own
voice
and
style.
Most
of
my
assignments
were
based
off
of
true
events,
which
made
it
easier
for
me
to
add
a
creative
flare
and
even
embellish
to
evoke
a
feeling
of
sadness
or
make
a
story
more
comical.
I
received
positive
feedback
from
my
professor,
who
let
me
know
that
she
enjoyed
my
sarcastic
and
perhaps
even
witty
tone
and
that
she
found
my
honesty
as
a
writer
quite
refreshing.
Until
this
day,
some
of
those
writings
are
still
some
of
my
favorite
pieces.
Part
of
the
reason
why
I
enjoyed
this
creative
writing
class
so
much
is
because
even
though
I
was
technically
writing
for
school
it
did
not
feel
that
way.
The
pieces
I
wrote
in
that
class
were
quite
different
from
the
typical
arguments
and
research
papers
I
had
been
asked
to
produce
over
the
years.
I
felt
as
though
my
professor
was
not
only
trying
to
teach
her
students
how
to
write
well,
but
how
to
write
differently
and
for
themselves.
I
do
not
remember
the
exact
assignments
but
I
do
know
that
I
wrote
on
topics
such
as
my
Sweet
Sixteen
birthday
party
and
a
car
accident
I
had
gotten
into
in
high
school.
Although
I
probably
could
have
totally
made
something
up
for
these
assignments,
I
chose
to
focus
on
something
real
that
had
actually
occurred.
I
found
this
to
be
even
more
challenging
and
creative
because
I
wanted
to
accurately
explain
a
feeling
and
carefully
describe
little
details.
As
I
have
gotten
older,
most
of
what
I
write
is
still
based
on
material
that
I
read
in
class
and
essays
during
exams.
However,
I
am
also
finding
that
recently
there
are
more
and
more
writings
I
have
done
on
my
own.
These
writings
are
mostly
for
me,
as
opposed
to
writings
I
did
as
a
child.
For
example,
I
recently
found
a
collection
of
cards
I
had
written
to
my
mother
when
I
was
a
child.
Her
job
required
her
to
travel
at
least
twice
a
year
and
I
would
always
write
her
cards
letting
her
know
how
much
I
was
going
to
miss
her.
There
have
also
been
many
instances
where
I
have
written
cards
to
my
grandmother
in
Florida,
some
of
which
were
written
in
Spanish.
I
have
found
that
as
I
get
older
I
write
more
on
my
own
and
for
myself.
Although
I
stopped
keeping
a
journal
years
ago,
I
still
write
when
I
am
at
a
particularly
confused
time
in
my
life
or
if
something
very
upsetting
has
just
happened.
I
never
really
thought
about
why
I
do
this
until
recently.
I
write
about
these
things
to
remember,
to
learn,
to
cope,
and
perhaps
even
to
identify
and
understand
the
feelings
that
I
am
experiencing
at
a
particular
moment.
It
is
also
easier
for
me
to
express
certain
things
in
writing.
For
example,
if
I
know
that
I
have
hurt
somebody
close
to
me
it
is
easier
for
me
to
express
my
regret
and
apologize
on
paper.
I
feel
that
the
words
come
more
naturally
and
that
there
is
something
more
sincere
and
personal
about
writing.
I
also
got
into
the
habit
of
writing
long
e-mails
to
my
friends
while
I
was
studying
abroad
last
semester.
I
preferred
exchanging
e-mails
because
I
could
tell
that
my
friends
could
hear
me
explaining
stories
through
my
written
words
as
if
I
were
right
in
front
of
them.
A
simple
thank
you
card
to
the
woman
I
stayed
with
in
Spain
turned
into
the
two
of
us
exchanging
letters
every
now
and
then.
All
of
my
previous
writing
also
became
very
useful
during
my
internship
at
Merrill
Lynch
this
summer.
Writing
e-mails
to
clients
and
memos
for
my
boss
came
almost
second
nature
to
me
because
of
the
background
I
have
in
writing
and
the
fact
that
I
am
comfortable
with
my
writing
abilities.
Since
writing
is
everywhere
around
us,
whether
we
realize
it
or
not,
I
believe
it
is
a
skill
that
everyone
should
at
least
try
to
master.
Without
writing
we
would
not
be
able
to
express
personal
feelings
through
letters,
cards,
or
even
eulogies.
We
would
not
be
able
to
enjoy
watching
television
or
listening
to
music,
as
scripts
and
song
lyrics
are
obviously
written
by
others.
In
this
way,
writing
can
come
with
great
expectations,
always
wanting
the
next
movie,
novel,
or
essay
to
be
better
than
the
last.
When
I
think
about
how
I
arrived
where
I
am
today
in
my
writing
I
come
back
to
the
idea
of
how
much
reading
has
influenced
me.
For
example,
not
only
do
I
read
for
entertainment
but
I
also
read
to
become
a
better
writer.
Books
such
as
Woe
is
I
and
Words
Fail
Me
by
Patricia
Williams,
in
addition
to
Eats,
Shoots,
and
Leaves
by
Lynne
Truss
are
all
books
I
have
read
in
the
hopes
of
improving
my
grammar
and
punctuation.
Reading
to
become
a
better
writer
is
something
I
would
not
even
consider
doing
if
I
did
not
truly
enjoy
writing.
The
more
I
read
and
write
the
more
I
recognize
the
large
role
that
writing
plays
in
everyday
life.
Although
I
do
not
exactly
know
where
I
am
headed
as
a
writer,
I
do
know
that
pretty
soon
the
time
will
come
when
I
will
have
to
start
writing
simply
for
myself.
Although
I
enjoy
doing
this,
I
always
seem
to
spend
much
more
time
on
assignments
and
other
things
that
are
required
for
a
class.
Describing
my
history
as
a
writer
makes
me
aware
of
the
changes
I
want
to
make
in
the
future.
I
want
to
be
less
dependent
on
the
approval
of
others
and
realize
that
I
do
not
need
a
letter
grade
to
make
me
feel
proud
of
my
work.
However,
this
is
not
to
say
that
I
am
not
currently
comfortable
and
pleased
with
my
writing
thus
far.
I
can
only
hope
that
every
act
of
writing
will
serve
to
better
the
next.
