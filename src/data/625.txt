Narrative
To
me,
what
I
read
has
a
direct
correlation
to
the
mood
that
I
am
currently
in.
Usually
this
lends
itself
to
a
plethora
of
choices,
a
myriad
of
different
books
on
my
shelf.
However,
there
is
one
series
that
lends
itself
to
every
one
of
my
moods.
These
books
are
the
ones
I
have
grown
up
with,
which
have
educated,
entertained,
and
comforted
me
as
I
wended
my
way
through
the
uncertainty
of
high
school
and
even
accompanied
me
to
college.
Harry
Potter
and
the
Sorcerer's
Stone
was
the
first
book
that
I
wasn't
told
to
read
and
it
also
was
the
first
book
I
couldn't
put
down.
To
this
day,
it
remains
one
of
those
books
that
I
can
pick
up
and,
at
times,
even
recite
certain
lines
from
memory.
After
discovering
Harry
Potter
for
the
first
time,
I
no
longer
perceived
reading
to
be
a
chore.
It
was
no
longer
a
task
that
had
to
be
done;
it
was
an
activity
I
took
on
with
pleasure.
My
mother
always
told
me
that
if
I
wanted
to
become
a
better
writer,
I
had
to
read
more.
While
my
mother
is
full
of
clichs
that
I
never
really
listened
to,
I
actually
took
this
one
to
heart.
With
these
words
in
mind,
Harry
Potter
over
the
years
led
me
to
discover
some
of
my
favorite
books
by
authors
like
Kurt
Vonnegut,
Roberto
Bolao,
and
Carlos
Ruz
Zafn.
While
I
read
these
books
for
pleasure,
not
seeking
any
literary
enrichment,
what
I
did
seem
to
take
away
from
these
books
are
the
subtle
differences
in
writing
narratives
and
voices.
Kurt
Vonnegut's
literary
voice
is
one
of
the
most
distinctive
in
American
literature
and
Roberto
Bolao
and
Carlos
Ruz
Zafn
have
two
of
the
most
recognizable
writing
styles
in
Mexican
and
Spanish
literatures
respectfully.
Each
of
the
three
formulate
their
plots,
develop
their
characters,
and
create
their
own
realities
in
completely
different
and
original
ways.
Even
though
some
may
argue
that
literature
is
written
for
the
author
to
express
his
own
emotions
rather
than
the
intellectual
advancement
of
the
reader,
I
think
that
I
took
away
just
as
much
from
these
authors
as
they
did
themselves
because
I
have
recently
realized
that
I
can
trace
my
very
own
style
of
creative
writing
back
to
these
three
authors.
For
example,
when
I
creatively
write,
I
find
that
I
tend
to
form
my
characters
in
a
way
very
similar
to
what
I
think
Kurt
Vonnegut
would.
I
give
them
words
a
real
person
would
speak
instead
of
elevated
and
unrealistically
eloquent
dialogue,
create
flaws
for
them
instead
of
making
a
Superman
without
his
weakness
for
Kryptonite,
and
write
about
inner
conflicts
that
a
character
deals
with
inside
himself,
exploring
the
shades
of
grey
in
life
rather
than
just
the
black
and
white.
From
Roberto
Bolao,
I
derive
my
sense
of
intensity
and
rawness
in
writing.
What
he
writes
about
aren't
the
amazing
things
that
the
hero
of
the
country
has
done,
but
what
the
common
man
must
go
through
in
his
journey
through
life.
From
Carlos
Ruz
Zafn,
I
have
received
my
sense
of
realism
and
original
language.
No
longer
do
I
settle
for
idioms
and
clichs
like
my
mother,
but
rather
strive
to
write
using
similes
that
haven't
been
thought
of
or
written
before
in
order
to
give
readers
an
entirely
new
sense
of
what
I
wish
to
portray,
attempting
to
incorporate
all
the
senses
rather
than
just
one
or
two.
Nevertheless,
I
have
not
come
to
these
conclusions
in
a
single
summer
but
they
have
been
slowly
formulating
over
a
many
years
of
writing
and
reading,
eventually
leaving
me
at
this
point
in
my
writing
career.
One
of
my
first
writing
experiences
I
remember
took
place
in
second
grade.
It
was
Christmas
time
and
we
were
supposed
to
write
and
illustrate
a
short
book
that
was
actually
bound
about
our
families
and
our
Christmas
traditions
that
we
could
give
to
our
mothers
and
fathers
as
a
gift.
I
remember
spending
nearly
all
day
on
the
book,
perfecting
my
words
and
my
illustrations
to
convey
details
and
facts
about
my
family
and
our
traditions
so
everyone
could
read
about
them.
I
gave
my
parents
the
book
and
I
remember
reading
it
aloud
to
them
multiple
times
on
Christmas
morning
and
being
extremely
proud
of
it.
Recently
I
found
this
book
while
I
was
cleaning
out
my
room.
It's
a
short
book,
probably
only
twenty
pages,
and
my
handwriting
and
illustrations
are
downright
horrible,
but
this
was
the
first
time
that
I
remember
being
proud
of
something
I'd
written.
More
recently,
(after
much
improvement
to
my
handwriting
but
not
much
to
my
illustrating
abilities)
my
writing
was
added
to
my
high
school's
literary
magazine,
Still
Life,
in
my
sophomore,
junior,
and
senior
years.
My
English
teacher
sophomore
year
rather
rudely
forced
me
to
submit
a
piece,
however,
despite
my
obstinate
nature
when
the
poem
was
accepted
I
was
filled
with
the
same
pride
that
I
had
experienced
upon
handing
my
parents
that
book
in
second
grade.
What
I've
now
realized
is
that
every
writing
piece
holds
a
different
sentiment
and
although
while
not
comparable
on
a
skill
level
the
two
pieces
were
not
so
very
different
in
the
sense
of
accomplishment
that
I
received
from
each.
For
the
next
three
years
the
Literary
Magazine
would
be
my
major
motivation
to
continue
to
creatively
write.
Writing
became
to
me
then
what
reading
had
become
when
I
discovered
Harry
Potter
a
form
of
escape
and
no
longer
a
requirement.
Seeing
my
work
published
gave
me
perspective
in
terms
of
using
writing
not
only
as
a
tool
of
self-expression
but
also
a
means
of
instruction.
Although
I
had
recognized
the
value
of
others
writing
I
was
surprised
to
discover
that
my
writing
could
have
a
similar
effect.
One
of
the
most
satisfying
and
memorable
literary
pieces
I
wrote
came
about
in
my
junior
year
writing
for
Still
Life.
The
piece
was
titled,
The
Cold
War
is
Not
Over,
and
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
pieces
I
have
written
to
this
day.
The
piece
went
into
satirical
humor
and
paralleled
the
similarities
of
a
battle
between
two
houses,
the
red
house
and
the
blue
house,
and
the
Cold
War.
The
competition
between
the
two
houses
led
to
a
neighborhood
rivalry
that
was
to
judge
who
had
the
most
and
the
best-looking
garden
gnomes.
The
playful
sarcasm
I
portrayed
in
this
piece
was
not
only
entertaining
to
write
but
also
was
one
of
the
most
original
ideas
that
I
have
created,
one
of
those
parallels
that
made
me
want
to
always
throw
off
clichs
for
the
more
witty
nuances
of
innovation.
It
was
also
through
this
piece
that
I
realized
my
writing
had
effects
on
my
peers.
I
still
remember
the
first
time
that
someone
I
didn't
know
came
up
to
me
and
complimented
me
on
my
piece,
telling
me
it
was
one
of
her
favorites
in
the
magazine.
I
was
floored
that
someone
I
didn't
know
would
come
up
to
me
and
say
this:
it
was
like
having
a
raving
fan-girl!
However,
not
all
of
my
creative
writing
was
received
so
well
in
high
school.
The
same
high
school
teacher
who
forced
me
to
submit
a
piece
to
Still
Life
used
to
make
our
classes
write
a
lot
of
poetry
and
then
submit
them
to
her
so
she
could
somehow
grade
us
on
our
poetry-writing
abilities
(something
I
didn't
understand
then
how
she
did
and
still
don't).
Regardless,
after
submitting
one
of
my
favorite
poems
I've
ever
written,
I
was
excited
to
get
it
back
from
her,
eager
to
see
what
she
had
praised
about
it
because
I
couldn't
imagine
she
would
write
anything
else
about
it.
Days
later,
to
my
shock,
I
received
the
poem
back
with
a
big,
fat,
red
four
out
of
ten
slapped
on
the
front
and
no
corrections
save
for
a
single
comma
and
the
word,
fine,
scrawled
across
the
top.
At
first,
I
refused
to
accept
the
four,
believing
it
to
be
some
mistake,
some
grade
she
had
meant
to
give
to
the
paper
under
mine,
but
accidentally
wrote
it
on
top
of
mine
or
perhaps
one
of
those
teacher
numbers
that
actually
a
nine
masquerading
as
a
four.
I
went
to
see
my
teacher
after
class
and
she
assured
me
that
the
grade
was
correct.
I
was
flabbergasted
and
all
I
could
sputter
was,
Well...why?
Her
response
was
simple
and
cruelly
unfair:
I
didn't
like
it
much.
I
wasn't
sure
how
to
react
or
what
to
do
because
it
was
so
unfair.
It
was
one
of
the
best
things
I'd
written,
yet
she
just
un-forgivingly
gave
me
a
forty
percent
on
it.
I
think
that
this
was
the
first
time
I
had
encountered
someone
who
just
didn't
like
what
I
wrote.
Before
this
moment
I
had
received
low
grades
on
math
and
science
even
the
occasional
history
test
but
I
was
accustomed
to
being
a
standout
in
English,
the
student
who
the
teachers
used
as
an
example.
I
came
to
the
realization
that
the
very
thing
I
enjoyed
about
English
was
the
very
thing
that
was
irritating
me,
the
subjective
nature
of
creative
writing
and
the
ability
of
a
reader
to
arbitrarily
decide
what
was
good
and
what
was
bad
regardless
of
how
good
the
writing
or
how
original
the
idea.
From
sophomore
year
the
creative
writing
changed
and
no
longer
was
innovation
and
creativity
encouraged,
the
lead
sentence,
rhetoric,
and
strict
structure
were
dutifully
drilled
into
our
minds.
For
a
few
painful
semesters
I
felt
that
academic
writing
could
be
nothing
but
boring
and
traumatic.
Thankfully,
I
was
proven
wrong
when
I
met
my
senior
A.P.
Literature
teacher,
Mr.
Bindig.
As
opposed
to
the
boredom
and
banality
of
academic
writing
during
my
junior
year,
I
quickly
discovered
that
academic
writing
could
actually
be
engaging
as
well
as
instructive.
Far
removed
from
the
tradition
five-paragraph
essays,
which
teachers
had
inculcated
into
students'
minds
since
fifth
grade,
we
wrote
two
academic
theses
based
off
of
three
to
five
books
we
had
read
both
inside
and
outside
class.
This
loosening
of
requirements
helped
immensely
as
far
as
fostering
an
academic
atmosphere
where
I
was
allowed
to
actually
use
my
own
ideas
and
create
something
from
my
personal
opinions.
One
subject
that
I
wanted
to
write
about
for
a
very
long
time
was
challenging
the
existence
of
God
in
an
intellectual
argument
using
literature
as
examples
and
proof
for
my
belief.
However,
coming
from
a
fairly
conservative,
religious
community
where
ideas
like
these
are
not
often
spoken
about
frequently,
much
less
written
about,
it
was
a
empowering
experience.
While
my
writing
had
been
completely
revolutionized
due
to
Mr.
Bindig's
guidance,
it
had
still
to
undergo
more
changes
before
I
(and
some
of
my
professors
at
Lafayette)
was
completely
satisfied.
While
feeling
entirely
prepared
from
my
years
writing
in
high
school,
college
writing
was
a
huge
step
that
transformed
my
writing
process
radically.
One
of
my
professors
pointed
out
a
flaw
in
my
writing
that
was
a
consistent
and
very
deep
flaw
in
my
writing
-
I
would
write
saying
things
like
The
authors
means
with
this...
while
really
meaning
to
say,
The
text
means...
While
this
difference
may
seem
subtle,
it
is
a
huge
problem
because
relying
on
what
you
think
the
author
means
is
intentional
fallacy:
no
one
can
truly
know
what
the
author
mean
when
he
was
writing
that
except
for
the
writer
himself.
Therefore
correcting
this
error
obviously
enhanced
the
quality
and
coherence
of
my
arguments.
For
me
writing
has
been
an
adventure
and
a
journey,
one
that
has
led
me
on
the
path
of
exploration
not
only
of
my
own
writing
but
of
other's
as
well.
Through
study
of
other's
writing
and
writing
development,
I
have
come
far
from
five
paragraph
essays,
far
from
my
second
grade
scrawl.
This
personal
growth
has
led
me
through
high
school
classes,
A.P.
classes,
and
college
courses,
while
still
allowing
me
to
write
for
pleasure
with
originality.
