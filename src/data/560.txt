Literary
Narrative
Fall
2008
When
I
first
read
the
instructions
for
this
summer
assignment
I
felt
a
little
overwhelmed.
To
be
completely
honest,
I
canOt
remember
enough
to
describe
Nmy
history
as
a
writerO
and
IOm
pretty
sure
that
my
monotonous
summer
job
(as
well
as
the
distractions
of
the
beach
and
summer
sun)
has
dulled
my
intellectual
tendencies
a
little
bit.
I
couldnOt
help
but
feel
like
the
essay
was
asking
me
to
prove
myself
in
some
way
and
since
I
wasnOt
committed
or
convinced
that
this
paper
was
really
helping
me
(like
it
said
it
was
supposed
to)
I
couldnOt
write
anything
that
demonstrated
or
described
who
I
am
as
a
writer.
Before
I
began
the
paper
that
youOre
reading
now,
I
wrote
seven
pages
of
chronologically
ordered
Nwriting
memoriesO
with
succinct
elaborations
on
my
supposed
interpretations
of
each.
After
re-reading
it
though
(and
consequently
realizing
that
it
wasnOt
very
good),
I
decided
to
start
over
and
do
what
my
writing
instincts
told
me
to.
I
know
that
in
order
to
write
something
that
means
something
to
me
(which
IOm
proud
to
hand
in
to
the
English
department)
I
have
to
be
honest.
For
me
thereOs
no
real
point
in
talking
about
the
writing
I
did
when
I
was
four
years
old,
nor
is
there
any
importance
in
writing
accomplishments
and
failures
that
happened
8
years
ago.
IOve
always
loved
learning-
especially
reading
and
writing-
but
IOm
not
entirely
sure
what
sparked
that
passion.
IOm
aware
that
my
successes
in
early
writing
probably
encouraged
and
helped
me
to
enjoy
writing
but
I
canOt
find
any
other
significance
in
them.
I
know
that
there
were
certain
events
that
helped
shape
and
change
who
I
am
as
a
writer,
but
I
donOt
think
they
occurred
during
elementary
or
middle
school.
IOm
almost
entirely
positive
that
the
writing
skills
that
I
possess
now
are
a
direct
result
of
the
type
of
teachers
and
high
standards
I
encountered
in
high
school.
IOve
always
been
able
to
achieve
good
grades
on
writing
assignment
and
have
consistently
received
positive
feedback
from
my
teachers,
parents
and
peers.
Since
I
was
lucky
enough
to
attend
one
of
the
best
public
schools
in
the
country
(where
writing
was
a
serious
component
of
any
class
offered)
I
encountered
and
mastered
all
different
types
of
writing.
I
became
especially
good
at
research
papers
during
my
high
school
years.
Every
student
that
took
an
interest
in
science
(in
taking
honors
or
AP
science
courses)
was
required
to
take
a
science
research
class
that
consisted
of
conducting
research
and
writing
research
papers.
Since
I
took
advanced
science
courses
every
year
during
high
school
IOve
conducted
several
science
research
projects.
I
have
written
several
30
page
research
papers
that
not
only
exhibit
the
proper
way
to
write
about
previously
recorded
research
but
also
how
to
document
findings
and
make
citations.
During
my
final
year
in
the
research
program
my
project
and
writing
placed
helped
me
to
win
3rd
place
in
a
research
fair.
My
ability
to
easily
receive
good
grades
on
my
writing
was
tested
when
I
entered
11th
grade
AP
Language.
For
the
first
time
I
had
a
teacher
with
extremely
different
teaching
techniques
and
higher
expectations
than
I
had
ever
experienced
before.
For
the
first
time
I
received
a
C
on
a
piece
of
writing.
I
spent
the
first
few
months
of
AP
Language
extremely
confused
because
there
were
absolutely
no
writing
or
typical
NEnglishO
exercises
at
all.
While
other
English
classes
were
reading
the
classics
and
dissecting
poetry,
we
were
studying
scientific
articles
that
discussed
the
origins
and
evolution
of
language.
Once
we
developed
a
strong
background
in
this
kind
of
history,
we
moved
on
to
reading
philosophy
pieces
that
questioned
the
art
of
writing
and
thought.
My
teacher,
Mrs.
Bossong,
was
determined
to
make
us
realize
that
in
order
successfully
read
or
analyze
any
kind
of
literature
(and
in
turn
write
insightful
conclusions)
we
had
to
understand
how
to
approach
literature-the
things
to
look
and
the
kinds
of
questions
to
ask.
One
of
my
most
memorable
writing
experiences
in
AP
Language
was
a
synthesis
essay.
The
assignment
was
to
combine
knowledge
of
four
seemingly
unrelated
books
to
support
a
common
thesis.
Part
of
the
assignmentOs
guidelines
was
that
the
essay
could
only
be
written
within
a
given
amount
of
class
time.
The
idea
of
an
Nin-class
essayO
was
not
foreign
but
what
came
as
a
surprise
to
everyone
was
that
during
the
first
hour
and
a
half
of
the
given
class
time,
no
one
was
allowed
to
write
anything.
Every
other
Nin-class
essayO
seemed
to
be
time
constrained
and
rushed
so
that
the
class
could
be
graded
and
move
on
to
the
next
assignment.
Mrs.
Bossong
didnOt
seem
to
care
how
long
the
essays
took.
She
taught
us
that
in
order
to
write
a
significant
and
perceptive
piece,
a
great
deal
of
time
should
be
in
thinking
(not
just
sitting
down
and
writing
whatever
thoughts
came
to
mind).
Because
of
Mrs.
BossongOs
ideals
I
spent
two
days
thinking
about
quotes
and
concepts
for
my
synthesis
essay.
I
am
happy
to
say
that
it
is
one
of
the
smartest,
wittiest,
and
insightful
pieces
I
have
ever
created.
At
the
close
of
AP
Language
I
had
to
write
an
assessment
of
how
the
course
had
changed
my
writing.
I
could
try
to
summarize
my
words
and
feelings
but
I
feel
its
better
to
let
them
speak
for
themselves.
NAP
Language
has
affected
how
I
approach
every
piece
of
literature.
I
entered
the
class
taking
literature
for
granted-only
paying
attention
to
what
it
was
at
face
value.
I
was
trained
to
look
for
character
development
and
plot
progression
and
was
not
fully
aware
of
the
hidden
stories
the
text
could
tell.
One
of
the
first
times
I
became
aware
of
text
was
while
reading
The
Great
Gatsby.
Continued
themes
and
words
allowed
the
text
to
take
on
new
dimensions.
The
characters
become
more
than
people-they
became
symbols
of
nature
and
of
themes,
of
elements,
and
human
tendencies.
I
was
captivated
by
how
Fitzgerald
was
able
to
tell
stories
within
stories
and
use
his
text
not
only
to
communicate
ideas
but
to
illustrate
his
outlook
on
society.
Now
I
am
able
to
approach
text
with
new
thinking
skills.
I
read
not
only
for
plot
and
enjoyment
of
relating
to
characters,
but
I
am
armed
and
ready
to
pick
up
any
of
the
clues
that
the
writer
will
leave
me
in
their
prose
and
words
choice.
Following
themes
and
studying
text
has
allowed
me
to
appreciate
literature
on
a
whole
new
level.
It
took
me
a
while
to
fully
understand
the
AP
Language
course.
I
couldnOt
understand
how
studying
NmapsO
and
theoretical
jugs
could
make
me
a
better
English
student.
What
I
didnOt
realize
was
that
in
order
to
be
a
better
writer
I
had
to
be
a
better
thinker.
Every
article
and
every
discussion
has
challenged
my
accepted
and
predetermined
views
and
standards.
AP
Language
has
taught
me
to
search
for
a
deeper
meaning.
Examine
and
question
everything.
Let
my
individuality
determine
my
outlook
and
my
conclusions-
not
what
other
people
preach
to
me.
I
decide
what
truth
is
and
what
my
connection
will
be
to
the
world
around
me.
My
writing
has
improved
because
my
thinking
has
improved.
It
took
me
hours
of
time
in
the
computer
lab
to
understand
what
at
English
paper
really
should
be.
Forget
about
sitting
down
and
knocking
out
pages
based
on
literary
elements
and
character
development.
Now
before
starting
any
paper
I
spend
a
good
hour
and
a
half
just
thinking.
Instead
of
writing
papers
that
reiterate
the
same
points
that
any
person
could
have
deduced
simply
by
reading
the
text-I
write
pieces
that
display
my
personal
interpretations
and
my
personal
beliefs.
Instead
of
simply
analyzing
quotes
and
showing
how
they
prove
a
point-I
find
myself
searching
for
the
modern
application
to
my
everyday
life
and
how
the
text
and
the
author
is
writing
and
connecting
to
me.
Literature
is
incredible
in
that
it
is
timeless.
All
people
can
relate
to
each
other
on
some
level.
We
all
experience
the
same
emotions
and
all
deal
with
the
pressures,
inadequacies
and
joys
of
mankind
and
society.O
I
think
that
it
is
important
to
mention
that
my
11th
grade
year
was
one
of
the
hardest
of
my
life.
I
had
just
finished
having
my
last
of
four
invasive
surgeries
and
my
father
was
deteriorating
because
of
progressive
M.S.
My
mother
(whose
job
it
had
been
to
hold
the
family
together)
was
having
a
hard
time
dealing
with
everything,
and
my
brother
was
beginning
to
abuse
drugs
in
order
to
avoid
reality.
After
crying
a
few
times
in
class,
I
began
talking
about
some
of
these
issues
with
Mrs.
Bossong.
I
had
always
been
a
private
person,
convinced
that
no
one
could
understand
what
I
was
going
through.
This
small
disclosure
of
information
was
difficult
for
me.
Mrs.
Bossong
encouraged
me
to
share
my
experiences
instead
of
hiding
them
(especially
if
they
were
unpleasant
and
hard
for
others
to
understand).
She
explained
that
these
experiences,
no
matter
hard
horrible
they
may
have
seemed,
were
valuable
because
they
gave
me
a
perspective
that
not
many
people
my
age,
or
any
age
for
that
matter,
could
possess.
Mrs.
Bossong
showed
me
that
if
I
could
somehow
express
the
hardships
I
had
endured
I
could
become
a
more
sensitive
and
original
writer-
one
that
had
the
power
to
educate
others.
The
answer
Mrs.
Bossong
gave
me
was
a
theme
during
many
of
our
classes.
Whenever
we
read
any
kind
of
article
or
literature
the
bulk
of
our
analysis
wasnOt
done
through
writing
to
be
handed
in
or
graded,
but
rather
through
discussion
with
our
peers.
When
there
was
a
writing
assignment
we
never
handed
anything
in
without
sharing
a
little
with
our
classmates.
Mrs.
Bossong
showed
us
that
everything
can
be
read
and
interpreted
a
different
way
when
seen
through
different
eyes
and
experiences.
It
was
our
responsibility
as
students
to
realize
this
and
to
seek
the
advice
and
opinions
of
others
in
order
to
decipher
all
the
possible
meanings
of
a
piece-
not
to
constrain
it
and
give
it
boundaries
by
only
seeing
it
through
our
eyes.
My
writing
continued
to
mature
the
next
year
in
AP
Literature.
My
teacher,
Ms.
Goodman
was
just
as
strict
as
Mrs.
Bossong
in
assessing
quality
and
content,
but
desired
a
different
outcome
as
the
result
of
her
teachings.
She
thought
the
goal
of
the
class
was
to
turn
us
into
excellent
essay
writers;
that
one
of
best
and
most
valuable
ways
of
expressing
our
opinions-
would
never
seem
a
daunting
task
to
us.
Every
Thursday
morning
she
handed
out
an
essay
assignment-
with
10
minutes
designated
for
thought
and
30
minutes
allowed
to
construct
a
fully
developed
essay
style
response.
The
assignments
were
always
on
different
topics
and
the
questions
asked
were
never
easy
ones.
Ms.
Goodman
penalized
if
the
response
was
in
a
standard
5
paragraph
form
and
graded
the
40
minute
attempts
as
if
she
had
given
a
weekOs
time.
My
whole
senior
year
I
dreaded
Thursdays
because
of
the
stress
of
receiving
another
difficult
writing
assignment,
but
now
I
can
fully
appreciate
the
results
and
practice.
Some
of
my
best
pieces
of
writing
were
nervously
scribbled
on
a
Thursday
morning.
By
the
end
of
my
senior
year
and
the
close
of
AP
Literature
I
was
sure
that
I
could
write
a
completely
convincing
and
insightful
essay
on
just
about
anything.
I
came
to
college
a
very
confident
writer.
The
high
expectations
and
excellent
teachers
I
had
in
high
school
made
the
academic
aspect
of
my
transition
to
Lafayette
an
easy
one.
I
am
happy
to
say
that
I
feel
like
I
have
done
a
lot
of
good
writing
so
far
in
college
and
am
looking
forward
to
using
all
of
the
resources
and
classes
yet
to
come
to
further
my
abilities.
I
know
I
still
have
more
learning
experiences
to
come
and
many
new
skills
and
perspectives
to
acquire.
