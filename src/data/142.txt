Writing
Assignment
August

Back
to
tiie
Basics
For
many
years,
I
was
content
with
or
limited
to
the
basic
writing
process
that
is
passed
down
to
each
new
generation
of
college
writers.
I
slowly
climbed
my
way
from
the
five
paragraph
essay
in
high
school
to
the
more
astute
fifteen
page
college
research
paper.
I
was
growing
exponentially
not
only
in
my
ability
to
coherently
express
my
observations
in
an
academic
frame
of
mind,
but
to
go
back
and
actually
review
my
work
from
an
objective
point
of
view
(a
result
of
the
WA
program
of
course).
But
this
maturity
and
rapid
improvement
seemed
to
grind
to
a
sudden
halt
as
I
entered
my
junior
year.
The
writing
process
had
become
mundane.
My
papers
seemed
to
be
a
stream
of
innate
blather,
only
written
to
fulfill
the
assigned
requirements.
Over
the
last
year,
I
have
challenged
myself
and
have
been
rorced
to
acquire
new
techniques
to
ensure
tnat
I
learn
something
from
each
writing
experience.
The
last
year
was
basically
split
into
two
parts
both
academically
and
geographically.
I
spent
the
fall
term
at
Lafayette
preparing
for
my
spring
semester
in
Chile.
Because
of
the
tremendous
experiences
I
had
this
past
spring,
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
remember
many
details
of
my
WA
work
and
writing
assignments.
However,
because
certain
problems
repeatedly
arose
(and
were
painstakingly
fixed),
the
my
overall
thoughts
concerning
last
fall
are
not
easily
forgotten.
Much
of
the
fall
semester
was
spent
coming
up
with
new
ways
to
the
same
point
across
to
my
first
year
students.
Once
they
had
the
information,
I
had
to
help
them
mold
it
into
an
organized
piece
of
work.
Spring
semester
on
the
other
hand,
I
was
challenged
with
the
pre-writing
process.
Instead
of
focusing
on
how
to
put
together
information
that
I
already
had,
my
challenge
was
the
process
of
gathering
enough
information
through
interviews
and
background
research
in
another
language.
But,
well
get
to
that
later.
The
most
difficult
experiences
I
had
last
fall
involved
students
that
consistently
had
the
same
problems
with
each
draft
of
every
paper.
It
had
been
my
experience
during
my
first
year
as
a
WA,
that
first
year
students
needed
an
overall
critique
of
their
organization,
thesis
statement,
and
content,
rather
than
line
by
line
corrections.
With
this
in
mind,
I
used
the
conference
with
each
students
to
explain
the
basics
of
the
college
writing
process.
While
their
final
drafts
of
one
paper
would
incorporate
these
techniques,
they
would
relapse
back
to
their
old
ways
on
the
very
next
paper.
They
seemed
to
acknowledge
problems
in
their
papers
only
when
I
helped
them
point
them
out.
I
finally
realized
that
it
wasn't
that
they
didn't
have
the
skills
to
write
a
paper,
they
didn't
have
the
ability
to
critique
a
paper.
After
discussing
the
idea
with
Professor
Averett,
I
decided
to
meet
with
the
class
to
go
over
the
techniques
of
editing
a
paper.
At
the
time,
I
had
a
research
paper
in
the
works
so
I
decided
to
use
that
as
an
example
of
how
even
someone
that
is
a
WA
always
needs
help
and
advice.
After
passing
out
copies
and
having
each
class
member
read
through
the
paper,
I
was
astounded
to
see
that
everyone
could
point
out
certain
areas
that
I
needed
to
improve.
It
was
then
that
they
came
to
the
realization
that
they
had
the
ability
to
critique
a
paper.
They
had
just
refused
to
objectively
look
at
their
own
writing
to
criticize
and
improve
it.
It
also
was
a
humbling
reminder
to
me
that
I
needed
to
improve
my
own
editing
skills.
This
experience
early
on
during
the
semester
also
helped
emphasize
the
importance
of
the
basic
writing
process.
For
the
first
two
conferences..
I
could
sense
that
the
students
couldn't
understand
why
I
was
reverting
back
to
such
simple
writing
techniques.
I
was
basically
given
them
a
line
by
line
structure
by
which
to
follow.
However,
after
reading
my
paper,
they
could
see
that
the
structure
and
organizational
methods
that
seemed
so
basic
in
their
papers,
was
strongly
instilled
into
mine.
It
also
taught
them
they
could
be
creative
and
venture
out
of
bounds
as
long
as
it
was
coherent
and
relative.
I
felt
that
showing
them
the
results
of
basic
writing
techniques
was
much
more
effective
than
telling
them.
While
I
was
preaching
these
lessons
unto
others,
I
felt
that
I
had
to
practice
them
myself
as
well.
I
was
faced
with
the
challenge
of
applying
the
writing
process
to
a
paper
that
was
very
quantitative
in
nature.
Towards
the
end
of
fall
semester,
I
had
to
do
a
research
paper
socially
responsible
investing.
Much
of
the
subject
matter
dealt
with
percentage
gains
and
various
statistical
trends.
I
had
to
be
creative
enough
to
make
it
more
readable
man
your
average
stock
report,
yet
ractual
enough
to
get
my
thesis
across.
I
found
that
by
simply
reviewing
the
techniques
that
I
was
teaching
to
first
year
students,
this
tack
was
easily
accomplished.
As
I
stated
earlier,
the
fall
semester
was
spent
teaching
and
learning
how
to
organize
and
express
information
once
it
was
obtained.
My
second
semester
was
the
absolute
antithesis
of
this
process.
I
lived
in
Chile
for
five
months
with
various
families
and
even
on
a
farm
for
awhile.
My
program
traveled
the
entire
three
thousand
mile
coast
of
the
country.
While
waking
up
and
having
to
think
in
Spanish
and
living
on
a
farm
with
an
indigenous
family
were
challenges,
nothing
prepared
me
for
my
final
month.
The
last
four
weeks
of
the
program
were
allotted
for
an
independent
study
project.
Our
program
directors
gave
a
stipend
to
live
on
and
expected
us
to
find
a
place
to
live
(anywhere
in
the
country),
our
own
subject
matter,
and
our
own
contacts.
We
couldn't
use
any
libraries
and
all
of
our
information
had
to
come
from
interviews.
Needless
to
say,
this
was
the
most
challenging
task
of
my
life.
As
an
economics
major,
I
decided
to
Chile's
privatized
social
security
system.
I
lived
outside
of
Santiago,
the
country's
financial
center,
and
began
to
gather
contacts
to
interview.
The
challenge
of
this
assignment
was
not
writing
the
thirty
page
paper
(though
that
proved
difficult
as
well),
but
to
learn
how
to
obtain
sufficient
information
to
write
from.
I
had
to
make
sure
that
I
extracted
all
possible
information
from
the
interviewee.
Unlike
a
reference
book,
I
couldn't
go
back
and
ask
questions
once
the
writing
process
was
started.
I
also
had
mentally
structure
my
paper
before
I
began
to
write
(something
I
never
do).
This
was
because
I
had
to
decide
who
to
interview
and
what
questions
to
ask.
It
was
extremely
difficult
to
structure
my
paper
when
I
had
no
idea
what
the
results
were
going
to
be.
I
decided
to
revert
back
to
the
simplicities
of
the
writing
process
and
leave
my
paper
open
to
as
many
options
as
possible.
I
started
with
two
basic
questions:
how
does
the
privatized
pension
system
function
and
how
do
the
Chilean
people
feel
about
it.
From
there,
I
went
to
various
offices
that
administered
the
pension
system
(very
much
like
a
Merrill
Lynch
in
the
U.S.)
and
tried
to
find
a
job.
I
eventually
worked
with
a
stock
broker
who
agreed
to
be
my
advisor
for
the
project.
He
set
me
up
with
over
forty
interviews
with
fund
managers
as
well
as
clients.
Most
importantly,
we
worked
on
developing
the
paper
before
any
of
these
interviews
took
place.
Once
I
had
finished
gathering
my
empirical
evidence,
1
had
to
learn
how
to
use
such
raw
data.
Unlike
information
that
I
usually
got
from
articles
and
reference
books,
these
statistics
and
opinions
were
not
analyzed
or
put
into
any
particular
context.
I
had
to
apply
the
data
to
a
concept
that
in
turn
I
had
to
create
myself.
Coming
up
with
a
thirty
page,
coherent
research
paper
stemming
only
from
verbal
resources
certainly
caused
me
to
alter
my
previous
writing
techniques.
I
found
that
writing
a
detailed
outline
for
the
project
before
the
paper
was
started
made
a
world
of
difference
once
the
information
was
obtained.
For
the
first
time
I
realized
that
you
don't
have
to
have
a
complete
set
of
data
to
begin
mentally
writing
a
paper.
The
final
aspect
of
the
four
week
project
was
to
give
an
oral
presentation
to
the
program's
students
and
professors.
While
I
had
experience
in
public
speaking,
this
was
the
first
time
that
a
paper
of
mine
would
be
on
trial
for
all
to
hear.
I
was
so
used
to
writing
for
one
professor's
eyes
rather
than
thirty
people's
ears.
It
was
very
apparent
that
writing
a
speech
would
be
far
different
than
writing
the
project
itself.
I
had
to
reduce
the
statistical
results
and
boring
financial
jargon
to
elongate
the
attention
span
of
my
peers.
After
sitting
through
fifteen
presentations,
I
realized
that
fine
detail
made
eves
droop
and
ears
tune
out.
Therefore,
the
maioritv
of
my
speech
consisted
of
the
broad,
general
topics
of
my
project.
While
my
two
semesters
were
incredibly
different,
each
learning
process
was
invaluable
to
my
growth
as
a
writer.
Teaching
and
reiterating
the
fundamentals
of
the
writing
process
to
students
in
the
fall
proved
to
be
helpful
in
starting
my
project
in
the
spring.
This
past
year
also
taught
me
that
when
you
cease
to
learn
and
open
your
mind
to
new
ideas
in
writing,
then
you
lose
sight
of
what
made
you
a
successful
writer
in
the
first
place.
The
solution
to
this
is
to
go
back
to
the
basics.
As
for
advice
to
incoming
WAs,
I
think
that
I
have
had
several
experiences
and
observations
that
have
been
key
to
my
longevity
in
the
program.
I
think
the
first
and
foremost
important
piece
of
advice
is
to
keep
constant
contact
with
the
professor
I
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
have
Professor
Averett
who
is
not
only
clear
as
to
her
requirements
and
desires,
but
is
open
to
my
ideas
as
well.
I
do
know
of
several
WAs
in
the
past
that
barely
saw
their
professor.
It
only
seems
logical
that
this
could
lead
to
contradictions
in
writing
style
between
the
professor
and
the
WA
as
well.
Furthermore,
the
WA
may
not
be
emphasizing
what
is
desired
by
the
professor.
On
a
less
academic
note,
I
would
advise
incoming
WAs
to
develop
some
kind
of
policy
regarding
late
papers
and
missed
appointments.
I
have
found,
especially
with
first
year
students,
that
once
you
give
just
a
bit
of
leniency,
then
it
is
often
taken
advantage
of.
This
is
something
else
that
can
be
discussed
with
the
professor
who
will
most
likely
be
more
effective
in
getting
the
discipline
across.
Finally,
as
I
experienced
last
semester,
do
not
be
afraid
to
go
back
to
what
made
you
a
successful
writer.
It
has
often
been
the
case
for
me
that
when
I
teach
others
the
basics,
my
papers
gain
from
it.
It
is
also
important
to
realize
that
even
though
we
are
given
the
responsibility
of
teaching
others
how
to
write,
it
doesn't
mean
that
we
do
not
have
room
for
improvement
ourselves.
