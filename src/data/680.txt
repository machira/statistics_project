I
was
surprised
last
year
when
my
friends
would
come
find
me
in
the
library
for
me
to
look
at
their
writing;
it
was
as
if
I
had
the
letters
NWAO
stamped
to
my
forehead
that
gave
me
credibility
that
I
could
write.
I
found
it
amusing
that
friends
sought
out
my
advice
because
of
my
new
stamp.
Being
a
WA
was
a
symbol
to
them
that
I
could
proofread
and
help
them
out
with
their
writing,
something
that
I
would
have
done
for
them
anyways
before
getting
involved
in
the
College
Writing
Program.
It
wasnOt
until
my
second
semester
as
a
WA
when
I
had
been
requested
to
WA
a
particular
course
and
my
WA-ees
started
seeking
me
out
on
their
own
time,
that
I
realized
maybe
I
was
a
student
who
knew
a
little
something
about
writing.
Just
because
I
was
a
WA
last
year,
doesnOt
mean
I
always
find
writing
a
piece
of
cake.
Whether
it
was
the
300-level
junior
year
courses
or
the
new
types
of
writing
I
encountered
over
the
past
year,
I
found
myself
at
times
frustrated
with
the
way
my
drafts
were
turning
out.
I
struggled
with
assignments
from
understanding
the
prompt
to
being
asked
to
do
new
types
of
writing.
As
a
WA
I
couldnOt
believe
that
I
was
having
trouble
writing
when
I
was
hired
by
the
College
Writing
Program
to
advise
other
student
writers.
My
junior
year
courses
challenged
my
writing
skills
and
made
me
a
stronger
writer;
the
assignments
took
basic
principles
of
writing
to
the
next
level.
My
own
challenging
experiences
as
a
writer
helped
me
to
better
advise
my
WA-ees
in
my
conferences
because
I
was
able
to
better
relate
to
the
different
stages
of
the
writing
processes.
This
past
fall
semester
at
Lafayette,
I
had
one
of
the
hardest
assignments
of
my
college
career
all
because
I
had
trouble
understanding
what
was
being
asked
of
me;
after
that
experience,
I
made
it
a
starting
point
in
my
WA
conferences
to
discuss
the
prompt
and
make
sure
the
WA-ee
felt
confident
in
their
understanding
of
the
prompt.
The
writing
that
gave
me
such
a
struggle
was
in
my
Literature
of
the
Sea
course
where
I
was
asked
to
classify
the
genre
of
Moby-Dick.
It
sounded
simple
to
me.
I
just
had
to
pick
a
genre
and
find
three
to
four
pieces
of
supporting
evidence
within
the
text
to
back
up
my
choice.
I
chose
comedy
as
my
genre
and
found
some
great
examples
in
Moby-Dick.
After
receiving
the
rough
draft
back
with
my
professorOs
comments
on
it,
I
realized
that
maybe
I
didnOt
quite
understand
what
I
was
supposed
to
do.
I
was
missing
something,
something
big.
After
rereading
the
prompt
and
the
feedback
from
my
professor
plenty
of
times,
I
spoke
with
my
professor
and
asked
questions
not
about
what
I
had
written,
but
about
the
assignment
itself.
I
ended
up
rewriting
my
entire
paper
because
I
felt
I
needed
to
just
start
new.
I
defined
how
I
was
using
the
genre
comedy
and
what
the
comedic
elements
were
doing
to
tell
the
story
of
Moby-Dick.
I
was
not
that
confident
when
I
turned
in
the
paper
because
of
the
way
I
had
started
out
on
this
assignment.
Even
though
I
had
made
changes
from
my
original
draft
I
still
wasnOt
sure
if
I
had
grasped
what
I
was
supposed
to
do;
I
was
absolutely
shocked
when
I
received
an
NAO
on
it.
The
writing
process
of
my
Moby-Dick
paper
made
me
realize
how
easy
it
is
to
make
mistakes
in
assignments
if
the
prompt
isnOt
understood
entirely.
My
professor
made
it
easy
for
me
to
ask
questions
about
the
assignment
and
now
I
always
begin
my
conferences
by
asking
if
my
WA-ees
have
questions
about
the
assignment.
I
learned
that
it
is
good
to
talk
about
the
assignment
even
if
the
students
believe
they
know
what
they
need
to
do.
I
always
print
out
the
prompt
so
I
have
a
hardcopy
right
in
front
of
the
student
writers
and
I
think
this
helps
to
initiate
a
discussion
between
me
and
the
WA-ees
because
it
makes
the
student
rewind
and
refer
back
to
the
original
prompt.
Anything
that
needs
clarification
they
can
ask
me
and
I
think
it
allows
the
WA-ees
to
better
relate
the
current
draft
that
weOll
be
looking
at
to
what
the
professor
is
asking
them
to
do.
I
have
continued
to
find
that
my
experiences
as
a
student
writer
can
help
my
WA-ees,
so
I
use
these
experiences
to
support
discussions
in
my
conferences.
I
encountered
a
new
form
of
writing,
environmental
writing,
this
past
spring,
which
gave
me
experience
in
writing
for
different
audiences.
In
my
course
I
read
many
short
writing
pieces
such
as
stories,
poems,
scientific
journals,
that
were
all
written
strategically
to
target
certain
audiences.
After
reading
numerous
types
of
writing,
it
was
time
I
had
to
create
my
own.
Even
though
I
had
environmental
pieces
I
could
refer
to,
I
had
trouble
with
the
creative
elements
of
having
my
pieces
portray
to
the
audience
what
I
had
in
mind.
I
hadnOt
taken
a
course
before
where
the
audience
for
each
piece
of
writing
varied
by
the
piece;
I
wasnOt
writing
in
an
academic
tone
or
just
to
my
peers
but
I
found
myself
writing
to
a
general
audience,
a
local
audience,
or
an
environmentalist
audience.
Throughout
the
course
I
learned
how
to
better
communicate
my
ideas
such
as
in
my
short
stories
I
had
my
characters
tell
through
their
actions
versus
telling
through
conversations.
I
found
environmental
writing
challenging
because
I
had
only
an
allotted
amount
of
pages
to
write,
yet
I
was
supposed
to
use
imagery
for
extensive
details
in
my
descriptions
of
characters
and
scenery.
Through
my
writing
in
this
course,
I
learned
how
to
better
pay
attention
to
the
way
the
writing
comes
across
to
different
people
and
how
the
writer
has
control
to
make
choices
to
change
the
way
the
writing
comes
across
to
the
audience.
I
realized
how
important
it
is
to
know
from
the
beginning
of
the
writing
process
the
audience
for
the
paper
is
intended
for
and
to
brainstorm
ideas
for
how
to
convey
the
writing
piece
to
the
particular
audience.
I
was
able
to
take
the
experience
of
considering
the
audience
in
my
writing
and
incorporate
it
into
my
WA
conferences
because
this
course
highlighted
to
me
the
importance
of
the
audience
reading
studentsO
work.
By
speaking
to
my
WA-ees
about
the
audience
for
their
papers,
I
found
that
quite
often
they
were
able
to
recognize
and
self-edit
their
papers
themselves
to
better
direct
their
writing
to
their
targeted
audience.
In
my
WA
conferences,
especially
with
younger
student
writers,
I
have
found
that
many
are
hesitant
to
use
NIO
or
contractions
when
the
paper
is
actually
supposed
to
be
for
their
peers.
I
ask
the
student
writers
if
they
would
speak
so
formally
to
their
classmates,
and
almost
all
times
the
answer
is
no.
By
discussing
in
my
conferences
with
the
students
about
who
their
paper
is
targeted
for,
usually
helps
them
in
knowing
how
much
information
to
give
their
reader.
For
instance,
if
their
paper
is
specifically
intended
for
a
person
who
has
read
Mary
ShelleyOs
Frankenstein,
then
they
do
not
need
to
include
a
summary
paragraph
with
details
on
the
characters
because
they
can
assume
that
their
audience
already
is
informed
of
this
information.
I
have
found
that
questioning
students
about
how
they
want
their
writing
to
come
across
and
if
they
think
their
paper
is
doing
that
correctly,
they
are
able
to
see
the
loop
holes
where
what
they
thought
they
communicated
and
what
is
actually
on
paper,
do
not
always
coincide.
By
having
the
student
writers
find
this
out
with
a
little
help
from
me,
I
have
found
that
they
better
understand
how
to
edit
their
work
to
write
to
their
intended
audience.
I
think
that
relying
on
my
writing
experiences
are
the
best
way
for
me
to
communicate
to
my
WA-ees
how
to
revise
their
drafts
because
I
am
able
to
relate
to
their
writing
process
from
my
prior
writing.
This
past
spring
I
was
a
WA
to
an
English
College
Writing
course
that
I
had
taken
freshman
year
where
I
had
had
my
partner
professor
as
my
professor
for
that
course.
The
assignments
basically
remained
the
same
but
the
books
and
other
material
that
the
students
used
changed.
I
told
my
WA-ees
that
I
had
taken
this
course
my
freshman
year
and
I
think
that
helped
them
in
recognizing
how
valuable
a
resource
I
was.
For
one
assignment
in
particular
the
students
had
to
visit
Special
Collections
in
the
library
and
thoroughly
examine
the
book
as
an
object.
I
strongly
recommended
to
my
WA-ees
to
go
back
to
Special
Collections
a
second
time
and
spend
30-45
minutes
just
looking
at
the
book
of
their
choice
and
writing
down
as
many
observations
as
they
could.
I
told
them
that
that
was
what
I
had
done.
I
met
with
my
student
writers
twice
on
this
assignment
and
found
that
almost
all
of
them
took
my
advice
on
revisiting
their
book
in
Special
Collections.
By
having
this
direct
of
experience
of
doing
this
assignment
previously,
I
was
able
to
give
the
students
my
Ninsider
tipsO
that
had
helped
me
in
my
assignment
freshman
year.
I
knew
exactly
what
the
students
were
supposed
to
do
and
I
could
relate
to
their
confusion
or
difficulties
because
I
had
found
this
assignment
challenging
freshman
year.
I
would
recommend
to
new
WAOs
to
advise
your
WA-ees
in
the
writing
process
from
tips
of
your
own
writing
process
in
addition
to
what
the
CWP
training
suggests
because
tips
from
one
student
writer
to
another
can
often
be
the
most
beneficial.
As
a
WA
I
find
myself
drafting
and
editing
papers
in
a
similar
way
that
I
always
have
and
giving
advice
to
WA-ees
(or
friends
in
the
library)
that
I
would
give
myself
on
my
own
drafts.
When
revising
my
own
work,
I
always
make
sure
I
clearly
state
what
my
paper
will
be
about,
that
I
connect
my
ideas,
and
that
I
address
everything
I
needed
to
in
the
prompt.
I
have
found
through
my
more
rigorous
course
load
and
being
a
WA,
that
my
writing
has
become
even
better.
I
find
myself
surprised
at
times
of
the
quality
of
the
work
I
can
now
produce
and
I
think
that
being
a
WA
has
helped
with
this.
Working
with
other
student
writers
I
get
to
see
different
ways
that
work
and
donOt
work
for
expressing
ideas,
which
helps
me
in
my
own
writing
to
either
try
something
new
or
to
keep
me
tuned
to
a
characteristic
such
as
flow,
that
possibly
another
student
writer
needed
some
help
with.
Instead
of
just
sitting
down
to
write
like
I
used
to,
I
have
found
myself
more
organized
in
the
way
I
write.
Writing
as
a
WA
makes
me
look
at
writing
more
of
a
series
of
steps
versus
writing
pages
at
a
time
without
connecting
everything
that
goes
into
my
writing.
As
a
student
writer
WA,
I
would
advise
new
WAOs
to
just
keep
a
mental
post-it
note
of
what
goes
on
in
your
conferences
and
how
you
can
apply
what
you
discuss
with
your
WA-ees
to
your
own
writing.
Additional
advice
I
would
give
to
new
WAOs
would
mostly
include
what
past
WAOs
shared
with
me.
New
WAOs
should
take
the
initiative
to
find
something
out
about
each
WA-ee,
such
as
the
sport
the
play
or
the
club
theyOre
involved
in,
so
that
you
have
something
to
talk
about
with
the
student.
I
think
that
being
able
to
personally
talk
to
a
student
before
a
conference
for
a
minute
or
two
relaxes
the
student,
as
some
students
are
quiet
when
in
a
WA
conference.
I
would
send
reminder
emails
about
conferences
the
morning
of
the
day
of
the
conference
so
that
students
remember
to
come
to
their
scheduled
time.
I
usually
meet
with
my
partner
professor
at
the
beginning
of
the
semester
to
go
over
everything
as
well
as
before
(and
sometimes
after)
each
round
of
conferences.
I
have
had
positive
experiences
with
the
professors
I
have
worked
with
so
far
but
I
know
that
sometimes
it
is
more
difficult
to
work
with
professors.
I
would
be
sure
to
be
communicating
with
the
professor
frequently
throughout
the
semester
to
ensure
that
youOre
doing
what
theyOve
assigned
you
to
do
for
their
course.
I
didnOt
expect
to
find
being
a
WA
as
rewarding
a
student
job
as
I
have.
This
past
semester
in
the
College
Writing
Course
I
was
WA-ing
I
found
myself
seeing
the
advice
I
gave
to
my
WA-ees
being
put
to
good
use.
Throughout
the
semester
there
were
3-4
portfolios
that
the
students
compiled
of
new
work
and
revised
work.
I
saw
the
feedback
that
I
had
given
students
being
taken
and
used
to
make
their
writing
stronger.
I
felt
like
I
was
helping
them
improve
their
writing
and
all
I
was
doing
was
initiating
small
ideas
that
they
took
and
did
the
work
themselves
to
change
their
papers.
In
follow
up
conferences,
my
WA-ees
started
bringing
in
copies
of
previous
works
of
writing
that
they
had
revised
for
me
to
look
at,
in
addition
to
the
paper
that
we
were
supposed
to
be
going
over.
I
felt
like
my
WA-ees
valued
me
and
wanted
to
become
stronger
writers.
I
began
to
feel
as
if
my
partner
professor
valued
my
advice
as
well
as
he
invited
me
into
his
office
hours
to
help
create
the
writing
prompts
for
the
portfolios.
Since
I
had
taken
the
course
my
freshman
year
I
remembered
what
it
was
like
to
be
in
his
class
with
these
similar
assignments
and
as
a
WA
now,
I
was
able
to
read
the
prompt
from
a
WAOs
prospective.
I
was
able
to
act
as
the
link
between
students
and
the
professor.
I
told
my
professor
that
the
students
werenOt
seeing
how
the
different
writing
pieces
were
being
connected
within
the
portfolio,
so
we
discussed
how
to
portray
the
assignment
on
the
portfolio
prompt
for
the
students
to
see
the
overall
picture.
This
experience
for
me
was
very
cool
because
I
was
helping
the
students
writing
and
the
professorOs
connection
between
the
students
and
writing.
