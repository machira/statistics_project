Literacy
Narrative
Thinking
back
over
my
life,
I
cannot
recall
the
very
first
time
I
actually
tried
to
write
something.
I
remember
learning
my
letters
by
tracing
along
dotted
lines,
using
extra
thick
lined
paper,
and
the
big
red
pencils
we
used
in
first
grade,
but
the
first
time
I
wrote
something
remains
fuzzy
in
my
mind.
I
do,
however,
have
a
stack
of
NbooksO
I
published
in
first
and
second
grade
in
plastic
bin
under
my
bed,
which
takes
me
back
to
my
early
days
as
a
writer.
I
take
them
out,
from
time
to
time,
and
laugh
about
them
with
my
family.
They
are
extremely
entertaining.
But
as
a
child,
I
thought
they
were
the
greatest
things
ever
to
be
written.
I
can
only
wonder
what
my
parents
thought
when
I
brought
them
home
as
my
first
grade
self.
Anyway,
the
books
that
now
reside
under
my
bed
are
brightly
colored
and
laminated,
and
all
a
product
of
WriterOs
Workshop
in
Mrs.
FeehrerOs
class.
I
remember
distinctly
the
blue
writing
folders
we
kept
in
our
desks.
Each
morning
we
would
take
them
out
and
write
stories
on
the
thickly
lined
paper.
When
we
felt
our
writing
had
reached
its
story
potential,
we
got
to
conference
over
our
work
with
the
teacherNeven
as
a
seven
year
old
I
enjoyed
talking
about
my
writing
with
my
teachers.
Using
COPSS
(Capitalization,
Organization,
Punctuation,
Sentence
Structure),
we
elementarily
learned
to
edit
and
revise
our
stories.
We
even
got
to
use
a
special
red
marker
to
make
changes
to
our
writing
on
the
lined
paper.
After
the
editing
phase,
Mrs.
Feehrer
would
type
the
story
up
for
us
on
the
computer,
print
out
the
pages,
and
then
we
would
get
to
make
illustrations.
Thinking
back,
I
prided
myself
much
more
in
the
art
department
than
on
the
actual
storyline
of
my
writing.
Even
so,
by
second
grade
I
had
developed
a
way
of
writing
that
I
still
carry
with
me
today:
writing
things
out
long
hand,
making
notes
with
a
pen,
typing
it
up,
revising,
revising
some
more,
and
printing
my
final
copy.
As
an
older
elementary
school
student,
in
the
fourth
grade
or
so,
I
discovered
poetry.
I
began
writing
poems
left
and
right,
most
seriously
about
the
different
seasons.
I
still
have
my
poetry
journal
from
that
year,
and
reading
through
them,
almost
all
of
them
are
written
from
my
own
point
of
view.
One
poem
is
about
a
girl
visiting
her
friend
swan
in
the
springtime,
another
about
a
young
girl
playing
in
the
pool
with
her
brother,
and
yet
another
telling
the
story
of
a
girl
picking
flowers
for
her
mother.
Not
surprisingly,
almost
all
of
them
rhymed,
with
the
exception
of
a
few
haikus.
Years
later,
upon
deciding
to
major
in
English
here
at
Lafayette,
I
am
still
struggling
with
poetryNmany
of
my
poems
rhyme,
though
I
did
try
very
hard
to
immerse
myself
in
other
kinds
of
poetry
writing
in
creative
writing
last
semester.
As
for
middle
school,
in
sixth
grade
I
learned
to
write
an
essay:
introduction,
with
topic
sentence
and
closing
sentence,
along
with
three
things
the
rest
of
the
paper
will
discuss,
three
body
paragraphsNall
with
opening
and
closing
sentences,
and
a
concluding
paragraph,
summing
up
everything
I
had
just
written.
At
the
time
I
knew
such
structure
was
boring,
but
went
along
with
it
for
the
sake
of
my
grade
in
Language
Arts.
For
whatever
reason,
the
Bedford
school
system
believed
students
should
actually
write
in
such
a
rigid
manner.
Although,
also
in
sixth
and
seventh
grade,
I
was
taught
about
grammar
usage,
which
is
completely
the
basis
for
how
I
use
punctuation
and
how
organize
my
sentences
and
paragraphs
in
writing
today.
I
am
a
packrat,
and
do
happen
to
have
many
pieces
of
writing
saved
from
my
middle
school
years,
so
I
can
say
quite
honestly
I
had
no
clue
whatsoever
how
to
use
that
grammar
my
teachers
taught
throughout
sixth
and
seventh
grade.
Though
I
did
have
a
strong
vocabulary,
and
didnOt
shy
away
from
using
advanced
words,
my
sentence
structure
wasnOt
at
all
varied.
My
writing
was
predictive
and
elementary;
I
lacked
style.
I
soon
entered
eighth
grade,
and
my
entire
writing
career
took
off
running.
In
sixth
and
seventh
grade,
everyone
in
my
grade
followed
the
same
Language
Arts
curriculum
at
the
same
learning
level.
But
upon
entering
eighth
grade,
the
administration
split
my
grade
up
into
two
groups:
those
who
needed
extra
work
with
the
basics
of
writing,
and
those
who
did
not.
I
was
placed
in
the
higher
level,
and
English
class
soon
became
my
very
favorite
course.
Perhaps
it
had
something
to
do
with
my
instructor,
whose
name
I
shamefully
cannot
recall,
but
also
in
eighth
grade,
I
found
myself
writing
outside
of
my
schooling.
In
eighth
grade,
writing
became
a
hobby
of
mine,
not
just
something
I
had
to
do
for
class.
As
a
project
in
the
first
couple
of
months
of
eighth
grade,
we
looked
at
fantastical
paintings
and
went
on
to
create
stories
based
around
what
we
saw.
I
have
never
been
one
for
fantasy,
but
I
found
myself
enjoying
writing
about
the
unrealistic
]
world
I
saw
in
the
paintings.
The
painting
I
originally
chose
was
of
somebodyOs
basement
shelves
filled
with
basketballs
and
ice
skates,
old
nets
and
boxes.
But
underneath
that
shelf
of
somewhat
ordinary
things
was
a
miniature
doorway.
That
would
be
the
center
of
my
story,
I
remember
thinking
to
myself.
I
created
this
extravagant
story
filled
with
curious
children
and
unknowing
adults,
creaky
staircases
and
sounds
of
old
houses,
disappearances
and
strange
occurrences.
All
of
these
things
tied
into
the
made-up
world
of
these
created
creatures
that
lived
in
the
basement
behind
the
hidden
miniature
door.
For
the
first
time
in
my
writing
career,
I
was
writing
out
of
my
comfort
zone,
and
I
was
really
using
my
imagination.
I
didnOt
know
where
the
story
was
going,
but
I
just
let
it
flow,
and
without
even
realizing
it,
I
had
written
fifteen
pages
(a
good
ten
pages
over
the
original
assignment).
I
ended
up
taking
several
other
pictures
home
and
using
them
as
inspiration
for
writing
other
creative
stories,
some
of
which
still
give
me
the
chills
when
I
read
them.
My
NfantasyO
writing
stage
soon
ended
as
I
found
other
such
ways
to
spend
my
time,
but
I,
along
with
my
writing,
gained
a
great
deal
from
writing
in
such
a
particular
genre.
Because
I
felt
so
personally
removed
from
the
situations
I
was
writing
about,
my
characters
were
these
people
so
incredibly
different
from
me,
and
other
such
characters
I
was
so
comfortable
creating
lives
for.
Before
my
eighth
grade
English
class,
when
writing
creatively,
my
characters
in
some
way
shape
or
form
resembled
me.
For
whatever
reason,
I
just
could
not
get
away
from
myself!
But
after
engaging
in
the
fantasy
project,
my
creative
writing
was
changed
foreverNI
learned
to
separate
author
from
speaker,
and
myself
from
my
characters.
As
for
high
school,
two
of
my
four
English
teachers
were
fired.
They
did
not
deserve
it
in
the
least;
I
learned
more
from
my
sophomore
and
junior
English
teachers
about
writing
and
literature
than
I
had
ever
before
in
my
life.
At
the
beginning
of
high
school,
I
began
keeping
a
journal.
It
started
off
as
a
school
assignment
marking
the
one
year
anniversary
of
September
11th,
and
it
turned
into
a
journal
I
kept
for
a
couple
of
months
during
the
fall
of
2002.
This
writing
was
not
creative,
and
it
wasnOt
exactly
poetry.
The
journal
began
as
more
of
just
a
dumping
of
all
my
thoughts
and
feelings
about
September
11th,
and
it
ended
as
a
dumping
of
my
thoughts
and
feelings
about
life
in
general.
Sometimes
I
wrote
in
full
sentences,
sometimes
I
just
wrote
words,
but
either
way
I
found
writing
in
the
journal
both
comforting
and
freeing.
Over
the
course
of
my
life
I
have
generally
been
a
very
happy
person;
I
have
always
had
close
friends
and
family,
but
my
journal
gave
me
a
different
kind
of
comfort.
It
was
as
though
as
long
as
I
wrote
about
it
in
my
journal,
the
situation,
however
monumental
it
may
have
been,
would
be
okay.
The
feeling
is
difficult
to
put
into
words,
but
the
type
of
writing
I
experienced
in
the
beginning
of
high
school
was
calming.
I
spent
a
bulk
of
sophomore
and
junior
year
learning
to
analyze
and
write
about
literature.
I
wrote
the
most
number
of
pages
for
academic
purposes
during
my
junior
year,
but
surprisingly,
this
was
the
year
none
of
my
assignments
were
given
mandatory
lengths.
Mr.
Chinosi
taught
us
to
write
until
we
felt
we
had
conveyed
our
point.
Before
junior
year,
whenever
I
was
writing
about
a
book
or
an
article
for
school,
my
teachers
first
of
all
asked
the
paper
to
be
a
certain
length,
second
of
all
told
us
to
answer
some
kind
of
question,
and
thirdly
wanted
us
to
do
so
in
a
structured
fashionNmuch
like
the
five
paragraph
set
up
I
learned
in
sixth
grade.
Mr.
Chinosi
told
us
out
right
on
the
first
day
of
class
he
thought
such
structured
writing
was
crap,
which
may
have
to
do
with
his
ultimate
firing.
At
any
rate,
he
taught
us
that
the
best
writing
does
not
follow
any
sort
of
formula.
I
was
wary
of
this
at
first,
but
quickly
learned
after
writing
my
first
paper
for
his
class
that
he
meant
what
he
said.
He
told
me
if
I
found
the
NIP
of
SO
(the
important
part
of
the
subject,
in
my
own
eyes)
and
then
began
writing
only
about
that,
my
paper
would
turn
out
far
stronger
than
if
I
decided
to
discuss
the
book
in
general
terms.
Mr.
Chinosi
continually
reminded
me
to
discuss
specifics
in
my
writing,
and
after
several
months,
my
writing
had
improved
drastically.
It
took
me
until
the
end
of
my
junior
year,
but
by
May,
I
had
developed
my
own
voice
as
a
writer.
Though
I
was
writing
mainly
academic
pieces,
not
creative,
at
this
point
in
my
life,
my
writing
had
flairNI
finally
felt
I
had
my
own
style.
Coincidentally,
junior
year
was
also
when
I
finally
became
proud
of
my
writing
and
actually
wanted
to
share
it
with
people
other
than
my
teachers.
Thinking
about
it
now,
I
wish
I
had
the
honor
of
having
Mr.
Chinosi
as
a
teacher
for
my
senior
year
over
my
junior
year
in
high
school.
He
single-handedly
prepared
me
for
writing
at
Lafayette,
and
senior
year
was
one
big
distraction
in
the
writing
department.
My
writing
didnOt
get
worse,
but
it
certainly
did
not
improve.
I
wrote
paper
on
the
Anglo-Saxon
poem
NThe
Seafarer,O
which
I
remember
thinking
was
quite
sophisticated,
but
my
teacher
was
not
all
that
impressed
with
it.
I
was
used
to
getting
As
in
EnglishNit
was
always
my
best
classNbut
senior
year
I
got
a
B
on
NThe
SeafarerO
paper.
I
was
unsettled
by
this,
not
because
of
the
grade,
but
because
my
teacher
criticized
my
style
that
I
had
worked
so
hard
to
establish
over
the
previous
year.
She
called
my
writing
elusive.
My
writing
was
cohesive
and
organized,
and
I
had
worked
very
hard
to
make
my
thesis
unique
and
discussed
on
a
high
level
of
complexity,
so
naturally
I
was
hurt
by
her
comment.
She
wasnOt
Mr.
Chinosi;
she
was
looking
for
structure,
so
for
the
rest
of
the
year
that
is
exactly
what
I
gave
her,
and
I
ended
up
doing
well
in
the
British
Literature
class.
It
was
not
all
that
enjoyable,
though.
I
felt
constrained
whenever
I
picked
up
a
pen
to
begin
writing
for
that
class,
so
not
surprisingly,
I
am
not
too
proud
of
my
writing
from
that
yearNit
doesnOt
have
any
NmeO
in
it.
Nevertheless,
upon
my
arrival
to
Lafayette,
I
was
undoubtedly
prepared
for
college
level
writing.
In
the
beginning
of
my
freshman
year,
I
spent
much
longer
on
assignments
than
I
do
now.
This
is
not
because
I
think
I
can
get
away
with
doing
less
work,
because
I
do
not
at
all
think
that.
ItOs
because
I
know
the
only
way
to
write
is
by
trusting
myself,
and
by
trusting
my
own
instincts.
As
a
young
freshman,
I
wanted
to
please
my
professors.
I
read
the
assignments
word
for
word,
and
spent
long
hours
planning
out
what
I
wanted
to
say,
how
I
would
say
it,
and
then
actually
writing
it.
As
an
incoming
junior,
I
still
do
want
to
please
my
professors
with
my
writing,
but
I
also
want
to
please
myselfNand
I
do!
Early
on
in
my
college
career,
in
my
FYS,
I
found
myself
writing
papers
by
first
finding
the
IP
of
S,
just
as
Mr.
Chinosi
had
taught
me.
My
FYS
professor
had
us
write
one
paper
on
each
of
the
four
books
we
read,
about
anything
we
wanted,
so
I
found
this
learned
technique
from
junior
year
especially
helpful.
Some
of
my
classmates
were
struggling
with
the
class
since
our
professor
never
gave
us
an
actual
assignment
with
a
question
to
respond
to,
but
I
felt
confident
with
my
papers
because
of
my
high
school
(well,
junior
year,
at
least)
preparation.
With
Mr.
ChinosiOs
advice,
I
made
up
my
own
question,
and
fully
responded
to
it
in
a
five
page
paper.
My
writing
was
structured,
not
in
the
restraining
five
paragraph
way
that
I
learned
to
steer
clear
of,
but
it
was
organized
and
reflective
of
my
personal
voice.
I
have
remained
challenged
here
at
Lafayette
from
the
beginning
of
freshman
year.
I
have
taken
difficult
courses
where
IOve
found
myself
lost
within
confusing
texts,
but
I
have
learned
over
and
over
again
that
actually
sitting
down
and
writing
about
a
text
helps
me
to
understand
that
text.
While
I
do
sometimes
have
trouble
comprehending
parts
of
passages
assigned
in
class,
my
writing
about
those
passages
actually
helps
my
reading
comprehension.
This
may
be
a
bit
backward,
but
I
have
learned
that
writing
is
so
helpful
to
me
in
that
sense.
All
of
my
professors,
though
different,
have
expected
distinguished
and
unique
ideas
from
their
students,
through
both
spoken
and
written
communication.
No
one
here
settles
for
mediocrity,
which
is
why
I
have
never
once
second
guessed
my
decision
to
come
to
Lafayette.
As
a
recently
declared
English
major
with
a
writing
concentration,
I
take
chances
when
I
write,
and
I
let
my
mind
wander
around
a
bit
before
actually
getting
out
what
I
want
to
say,
and
writing
papers
here
at
Lafayette
is
generally
not
a
chore
for
me.
I
like
playing
around
with
words
when
I
write,
and
I
have
recently
come
to
enjoy
reading
my
work
aloud
(to
myself).
While
I
do
sometimes
experience
writerOs
block,
and
just
cannot
bring
myself
to
form
any
sort
of
sentence
that
I
am
happy
with,
it
is
all
a
part
of
the
experience
of
growing
as
a
writer.
I
have
had
ups
and
downs
over
the
years,
but
overall,
I
am
happy
with
the
writer
I
am
today.
I
know
I
have
so
much
more
to
learn,
and
I
am
excited
to
continue
my
journey
as
a
writer
both
here
at
Lafayette
and
after
graduation.
Ideally,
I
would
like
to
write
for
a
magazine
after
graduation.
I
am
not
all
that
sure
what
kind
of
publication
I
would
like
to
write
for,
but
I
know
I
want
to
continue
my
love
for
writing
in
whatever
career
comes
my
way.
But
I
still
have
two
years
to
look
forward
to
here,
and
I
am
more
than
excited
for
my
history
as
a
writer
to
continue
and
mature
through
the
rest
of
my
college
years.
