WA
Workshop
I
don't
have
any
clear
memories
of
my
earliest
experiences
as
a
writer.
I
suppose
it
was
Mrs.
Bell
who
started
me
on
my
way,
but
my
memories
of
first
grade
are
too
hazy
to
be
of
any
help.
It
is
the
third
grade,
though,
under
the
tutelage
of
Mrs.
Pasler,
that
I
can
say
I
truly
remember
writing.
The
memories
are
still
vague
and
somewhat
incoherent,
but
it
was
the
third
grade
that
I
first
felt
connected
to
writing
in
a
real
sense.
Mrs.
Pasler
would
regularly
have
the
class
write
short
stories.
These
stories
could
be
about
anything,
fiction
or
truth,
fantasy
or
reality;
we
were
the
authors
and
could
go
wherever
our
stories
took
us,
or
wherever
we
wanted
to
take
our
stories.
At
that
time
in
my
life,
I
had
had
little
experience
with
anything
I
could
truly
call
my
own.
Having
a
brother
only
sixteen
months
older
then
me,
the
few
materials
possessions
I
valued
I
had
long
ago
learned
to
share.
This
was
not
necessarily
the
happy
Bamey-and-friends
type
of
sharing,
naturally,
but
the
black-and-blue,
screaming-for-Mom
kind
of
sharing
that
any
younger
sibling
knows.
Knowledge,
as
a
possession,
was
an
enigma
to
me
and
school
and
school
work
were
given
the
same
priority,
and
dealt
with
in
the
same
manner
as
cleaning
my
room.
"Why?
Because
I'm
your
mother"
was
easily
replaced
by
"Why?
Because
I'm
your
teacher,"
even
if
my
teachers
never
said
that.
My
work
in
school
was
simply
an
extension
of
the
habitual
obedience
of
the
adult/authority
figure.
The
writing
assignments
in
the
third
grade,
however,
showed
me
that
writing
could
be
owned.
Those
were
my
stories
I
was
writing,
no
matter
how
poorly
crafted.
Certainly
I
would
not
have
written
them
if
Mrs.
Pasler
hadn't
made
me,
but
the
key
to
those
stories
wasn't
a
matter
of
volunteerism,
but
of
creativity,
and
mastery.
I
did
not
have
to
share
those
stories
in
the
same
way
I
had
to
share
my
toys.
Certainly
my
teacher
read
and
graded
my
stories,
but
the
act
of
writing,
of
creation,
had
become
mine.
I
was
no
longer
writing
to
answer
questions,
to
take
tests.
Writing
was
no
longer
a
means
to
an
end,
but
was
becoming
an
end
in
and
of
itself.
For
the
next
few
years,
I
explored
that
freedom
of
creation,
not
knowing
quite
what
it
was
and
certainly
not
seeing
it
in
the
same
light
that
hindsight
sheds.
I
simply
enjoyed
it,
and,
as
a
typical
kid
on
his
way
through
grade
school,
I
pursued
what
I
enjoyed.
That
my
teachers
seemed
to
think
I
was
a
good
writer
for
my
age
certainly
helped.
In
junior
high
school,
though,
I
lost
that
newfound
love
of
writing.
It
was
certainly
not
my
fault.
I
was
the
same,
but
I
was
betrayed;
writing
was
no
longer
what
it
had
been.
When
I
entered
the
sixth
grade,
writing
lost
all
of
its
sense
of
freedom
and
became
once
again
an
impersonal
exercise
I
did
because
my
teachers
told
me
to.
The
change,
I
think,
came
from
both
the
assignments
I
was
given
in
junior
high,
and
my
understanding
of
those
assignments.
I
was
rarely
asked
to
do
anything
I
considered
"creative."
Now
it
seemed
all
I
was
doing
was
writing
reports
on
Thomas
Jefferson
for
my
history
teachers,
or
writing
about
books
to
prove
to
my
English
teacher
that
I
hadn't
skipped
the
homework.
Writing
lost
it's
attractiveness
because
I
never
thought
I
was
writing
anything
of
my
own.
Reports
for
social
studies
class
were
all
just
rehashing
what
some
guy
in
the
encyclopedia
had
written.
English
papers
were
basically
the
same
thing,
but
instead
of
rehashing
fact
I
was
rehashing
fiction,
or
comparing
Huck
Finn's
adventure
to
Tom
Sawyer's.
It
all
seemed
to
make
little
sense
and
required
nothing
of
me
as
a
person
distinct
from
my
peers.
As
far
as
I
was
concerned,
anyone
who
had
read
the
right
books
could
easily
write
exactly
what
I
had
written.
Right
up
through
most
of
high
school,
writing
remained
little
more
than
a
task.
I
was
still
receiving
some
praise
for
my
writing,
but
rather
then
encourage
me
to
write
more,
it
encouraged
me
to
slack
off.
I
could
get
by
with
less
work
than
most
students
in
my
class,
so
that's
what
I
did.
This
is
not
to
say
that
I
didn't
enjoy
school
or
learning.
On
the
contrary,
I
loved
both.
Writing,
however,
had
been
separated
from
the
learning
process;
at
least
my
perception
of
it
had
been.
A
paper
was,
to
me,
little
more
than
an
extended
test,
and
as
such
was
not
about
learning,
but
about
telling
the
teacher
what
you
had
learned.
Once
I
had
filled
my
paper
with
enough
knowledge
to
satisfy
what
I
thought
the
teacher's
idea
of
an
"A"
paper
was,
I
was
done.
My
senior
year,
when
I
took
AP
English,
I
was
able
once
again
to
write
"my"
stories,
and
they
gave
me
a
fresh
appreciation
for
writing.
Again,
we
were
encouraged
to
simply
write,
as
Mrs.
Pasler
had
encouraged
us,
without
having
to
fulfill
any
specific
assignment.
However,
these
assignments
were
few
and
far
between,
and
the
looming
dread
of
college
admission
essays
and
preparing
for
the
AP
test
meant
that
I
wasn't
pursuing
those
project
any
further
than
I
had
to.
Writing
at
Lafayette
during
my
first
semester
had
me
right
on
the
same
track
I
had
been
following.
The
writing
assignments
for
my
FYS
were
the
same
drab
research
papers
I
had
done
in
high
school,
but
longer
and
required
more
library
time.
They
called
for
as
little
investment
of
myself,
my
personality
and
opinions
as
I
had
come
to
expect
from
writing.
Literary
Questions,
which,
in
the
course
catalog
had
looked
like
a
change
from
what
I
was
used
to,
was
a
disappointment.
If
I
hadn't
been
living
in
a
dorm
in
Pennsylvania
at
the
time,
I
would
have
sworn
I
was
still
back
in
Smithtown
High.
And,
as
if
to
bolster
my
theories
about
writing,
we
didn't
even
have
tests
in
those
classes.
This
was
proof
positive
in
my
mind
that
papers
were
just
tests
that
used
up
more
ink.
My
views
began
to
change
the
following
semester
and
stemmed
from
two
classes:
Introduction
to
Philosophy
and
Modem
and
Postmodern
American
Literature.
The
philosophy
class
had
regular
writing
assignments,
due
each
class,
in
which
we
responded
to
the
readings.
Perhaps
because
the
ideas
and
questions
in
the
philosophical
papers
so
clearly
demanded
an
opinion,
I
once
again
began
to
include
myself
in
what
I
wrote.
Rather
than
simply
let
the
professor
know
that
I
had
read
and
understood
Plato,
I
was
interacting
with
Plato.
I
was
agreeing,
or
more
often
than
not,
disagreeing.
I
had
finally
discovered
that
vital
thing
I
had
lost
in
junior
high:
my
voice.
By
engaging
the
text
through
my
writing
I
was
no
longer
simply
restating
or
compiling,
I
was
creating
again.
I
was
furthering
the
discussion,
and
it
was
exhilarating.
Had
I
not
found
my
voice
in
that
class,
I
certainly
would
have
learned
a
great
deal
anyway.
I
would
still
understand
Plato's
views
of
matter
and
substance.
I
would
still
remember
that
Descartes
thinks
and
is,
but
that
knowledge
wouldn't
be
a
part
of
me,
just
a
part
of
what
I
know.
By
engaging
the
material,
and
questioning
the
text
through
writing,
I
was
not
only
showing
that
I
understood
it,
I
was
making
it
a
part
of
myself
by
digesting
it.
I
was
applying
it
not
only
to
the
other
knowledge
I
had
gained
in
school,
but
to
the
experience
I
had
gained
in
life.
Writing
served
as
the
process
by
which
I
internalized
and
applied
that
knowledge.
The
literature
class
had
a
similar
type
of
assignment
in
which
I
was
asked
to
engage
the
readings.
What
I
gained
from
these
writing
assignments
is
harder
to
define
than
the
others,
because
in
the
literature
of
the
English
class
the
objects
in
the
text
to
be
grappled
with
were
harder
to
find.
An
author
of
fiction
may
contend
with
the
same
topics
as
Plato
or
Descartes,
but
the
manner
is
different
and
often
much
more
subtle.
Many
times,
rather
than
deal
with
the
ideas
or
beliefs
presented
in
a
text,
as
I
did
in
the
philosophy
course,
I
was
forced
to
try
to
simply
locate
and
identify
the
ideas.
This,
also,
required
something
of
me,
as
a
reader,
that
I
was
not
used
to
putting
into
my
writing.
By
exploring
through
writing
the
texts
read
in
class,
I
was
forced
to
once
again
consider
my
own
experience
and
my
own
knowledge,
rather
than
simply
accept
what
seemed
to
be
the
general
consensus
of
what
a
story
"meant"
or
what
an
author
was
trying
to
"do."
The
difference
between
writing
of
yourself
and
writing
of
another's
writing
can
be
a
subtle
distinction
on
the
page,
but
it
is
a
vital
one
to
me.
The
act
of
writing
does
not,
in
and
of
itself,
give
one
a
voice,
but
it
can
be
an
outlet
for
someone
who
is
looking
for,
or
who
has
found
his
voice.
Having
taken
numerous
English
classes
at
Lafayette
I
have
learned
how
to
use
my
own
voice
in
nearly
everything
I
write.
Even
a
formal
paper
on
Shakespeare
or
O'Neill
requires
a
voice.
It
may
not
be
heard
directly,
as
in
those
informal
joumal-style
assignments
of
my
second
semester,
but
it
is
still
heard.
When
I
write
about
Shakespeare
or
O'Neill,
I
call
upon
what
I
feel
is
important
in
the
text.
I
decide
what
is
brought
to
the
foreground
and
what
is
relegated
to
the
wings.
In
that
light,
academic
writing
of
that
type
is
extraordinarily
empowering.
As
a
reader
presented
with
a
text,
I
encounter
a
foreign
voice,
that
of
the
author.
As
a
writer
writing
about
a
text,
however,
I
am
allowed
to
bring
my
voice
into
the
text.
The
original
author
has
ultimate
authority,
of
course,
because
I
cannot
work
outside
of
what
he
or
she
has
presented
to
me.
What
I
can
do,
though,
is
take
the
pieces
I
am
given
and
rework
them
in
order
to
find
something
that
has
meaning
to
me.
I
have
also
learned
that
in
clarifying
my
writing
and,
by
extension,
my
voice,
I
am
clarifying
my
own
thoughts.
Those
texts
which
I
have
written
about
and
addressed
directly
stand
out
clearer
in
my
mind
than
those
I
have
simply
read.
That
clarification
of
my
voice
is
intensified
through
each
act
of
writing.
I
am
never
writing
about
one
text
exclusively,
because
my
opinions
and
priorities
change
with
each
text
I
read.
However,
because
those
opinions
and
priorities
are
affected
by
my
writing
and
by
the
clarity
that
writing
affords,
I
have
unknowingly
affected
every
future
act
of
writing
with
every
past
act.
Every
time
I
write,
I
must
rediscover
my
voice
in
light
of
what
I
have
read.
Sometimes,
when
I
am
writing
about
ideas
that
are
new
to
me,
I
must
invent
a
new
voice
with
which
to
speak.
Other
times,
I
am
modifying,
my
voice
and
adjusting
it
to
give
what
I
have
learned
since
last
time
I
spoke
a
place
to
be
seen
and
used.
Writing,
as
I
have
learned
to
view
it,
is
both
an
external
and
an
internal
process.
I
write,
academically
at
least,
for
an
audience,
something
external.
I
am
presenting
someone
with
my
views
and
opinions.
My
acts
of
prioritizing
elements
of
a
text
in
an
academic
paper
stem
from
who
I
am
and
what
I
know
and
are
truly
personal
and
creative,
regardless
of
how
often
those
same
elements
have
been
prioritized.
This
prioritization,
as
well
as
the
reassessment
and
clarification
of
ideas
is
internal.
But
whether
I
am
addressing
myself
or
an
outside
audience,
my
writing
is
a
personal
creation,
and
that,
in
my
opinion,
makes
writing
once
again
worthwhile.
