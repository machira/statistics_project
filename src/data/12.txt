MY
HISTORY
AS
A
WRITER
WA
Workshop
August
28,
1995
Just
the
other
day
I
was
peering
through
my
father's
memoirs
and
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
a
story
I
had
written
about
my
father
in
second
grade.
The
torn
and
tattered
yellow
wide
ruled
paper
instantly
stirred
up
memories
of
our
writing
exercises
in
Mrs.
Reed's
class
in
1982.
The
story
is
entitled,
I
Love
My
Father.
It
is
amazing
to
think
about
how
much
I
have
grown
as
a
writer
from
this
chicken-scratched,
completely
unorganized
story,
describing
how
I
love
my
father
because
he
bought
me
cotton
candy
at
The
New
England
Fair.
I
sat
down
and
began
to
think
very
intently
about
the
most
meaningful
assignments,
teachers,
and
courses
that
have
shaped
me
into
the
writer
I
am
today.
Throughout
my
years
of
elementary
school
at
The
Cottage
Street
School
in
Sharon,
Massachusetts,
I
was
most
inspired
to
write
by
my
favorite
author,
Laura
Ingalls
Wilder,
who
wrote
The
Little
House
On
The
Prairie
series.
I
would
write
in
my
Holly
Hobby
diary
everyday,
in
hopes
of
writing
a
series
about
my
own
life
one
day.
The
only
other
types
of
writing
that
I
can
recall
I
did,
were
biographical
reports
and
research
papers
on
Walt
Disney
and
the
Aztec
Indians,
for
my
fifth
grade
teacher,
Mrs.
Schmitchl.
These
assignments
usually
involved
copying
almost
word-for-word
out
of
The
Encyclopedia
Britannica.
and
did
not
require
a
lot
of
imagination.
As
I
entered
Sharon
Junior
High
in
the
sixth
grade,
I
became
too
cool
and
too
busy
with
track
and
soccer
after
school
to
keep
up
with
my
journal
writing.
I
am
very
happy
that
I
did
take
the
time
to
write
down
my
thoughts
and
experiences
from
years
eight
to
twelve.
I
think
that
everyone
should
do
so
periodically
in
their
lives,
because
a
journal
is
a
clear
indication
of
the
growth
and
maturity
a
person
gains
over
the
days,
months,
and
years
of
their
life.
Eighth
grade
is
the
first
year
in
the
Sharon
schools
system
that
the
English
classes
are
divided
up
according
to
skill
level.
It
was
in
this
year
that
I
had
the
honors
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Engdall.
She
is
the
most
demanding
teacher
in
the
school,
but
also
the
best.
I
never
realized
that
I
had
the
ability
to
write
well,
until
Mrs.
Engdall.
She
introduced
me
to
all
sorts
of
types
of
writing.
I
wrote
poetry,
and
learned
about
iambic
pentameter
and
poetic
license.
I
wrote
sophisticated
reports
about
Greek
and
Roman
mythology
in
my
own
words,
not
World
Book's
words.
I
also
illustrated
and
authored
my
own
children's
book
that
I
went
to
the
elementary
schools
to
read.
After
receiving
an
A
for
the
year
in
Mrs.
Engdall's
class,
I
was
placed
in
ninth
grades
honors
English
in
Sharon
High
School.
Mr.
Murray
gave
me
my
first
taste
of
criticism.
He
would
have
the
class
write
descriptively
for
fifteen
minutes
about
whatever
we
could
think
of.
It
sounds
like
an
easy
exercise,
but
in
reality
it
was
the
hardest
for
me
to
complete.
I
am
a
very
organized
person
that
takes
hours
upon
hours
to
write
any
type
of
paper.
I
distinctly
remember
trying
to
describe
in
words
about
a
traumatic
scene
where
I
thought
my
brothers,
Brian
and
Michael,
were
picking
on
me
and
trying
to
make
me
wrestle
with
them,
knowing
they
would
always
win.
Mr.
Murray
tore
my
work
apart.
I
was
so
shocked
that
I
had
to
hold
back
my
tears
as
I
ran
to
the
girl's
bathroom.
Mr.
Murray
taught
me
a
valuable
lesson
with
all
of
his
constructive
criticism,
he
taught
me
to
show,
not
tell
when
I
wrote
descriptively.
Another
major
event
that
has
helped
to
form
my
writing
skills,
was
an
introduction
to
scientific
writing
in
ninth
grade
biology.
Mr.
Richmond
would
literally
yell,
which
probably
was
not
the
best
way
to
make
his
point,
that
scientific
writing
was
not
a
pretty,
fluffy,
imaginative
style
of
writing.
From
this
ferocious
teacher,
I
learned
to
write
only
the
facts
on
my
lab
reports
about
our
earthworm
and
crayfish
dissections.
With
all
these
various
types
of
writing
under
my
belt,
I
was
ready
for
more.
I
wanted
to
be
as
fluent
in
as
many
styles
of
writing
as
possible.
In
Mrs.
Conley's
eleventh
grade
English
class
I
did
my
first
analyzation
of
the
absurd
play,
Who's
Afraid
of
Virginia
Woolfe?
This
was
definitely
a
new
experience
and
I
had
to
use
arguments
and
evidence
to
back
up
my
theories
on
the
poem.
I
also
wrote
my
first
twenty-five
page
paper
entitled,
The
French
Impressionists
-
Evolutionary
or
Revolutionary?
This
was
the
first
extensive
research
paper
I
have
ever
written.
I
feel
I
went
about
approaching
the
task
as
best
as
I
possibly
could.
I
took
notes
on
over
fifteen
books,
and
organized
everything
on
notecards
that
I
color
coordinated.
Mr.
Pane
is
the
one
person
who
changed
my
attitude
about
writing
and
prepared
me
for
writing
in
college.
He
was
my
twelfth
grade
A.P.
English
teacher.
I
was
very
intimidated
by
the
brains
in
my
class;
consequently,
I
never
answered
his
questions
or
voiced
my
opinion,
unless
I
was
called
upon.
My
first
paper
tried
to
describe
in
five
pages
what
an
ant
that
was
travelling
in
a
spiral
pattern
around
my
thumb
encounters.
I
received
a
C
on
the
paper
and
I
was
very
disheartened.
I
decided
to
spend
as
many
hours
as
it
would
take
on
my
next
paper,
just
as
long
as
I
received
a
better
grade.
When
our
next
paper
on
the
definition
of
truth
was
returned
to
us,
I
saw
a
big
red
B-
on
the
back
of
the
paper.
I
began
to
see
what
type
of
style
I
should
aim
for
when
he
read
some
of
the
class'
best.
I
turned
my
situation
completely
around
when
we
started
writing
comparisons
of
books,
like
1984
and
Brave
New
World.
I
then
realized
my
best
attribute
as
a
writer
was
not
creative
types
of
papers.
I
was
much
more
apt
to
do
a
better
job
on
analyzing
books
and
poems.
I
received
the
highest
grade
in
the
class
for
my
paper
on
whether
or
not
Hamlet
would
be
thrown
in
jail
if
he
were
tried
in
a
court
of
law
today,
or
if
he
would
be
found
legally
insane.
I
began
to
gain
the
confidence
I
needed
to
possess
when
I
entered
Lafayette
to
write
papers
for
college
professors.
I
thought
I
was
really
ready
to
take
on
any
assignment
my
freshman
year
seminar
teacher
gave
me.
I
was
wrong.
In
this
course
on
the
morality
of
abortion,
I
learned
two
more
types
of
writing.
I
learned
how
to
write
in
a
legal
sense
and
in
a
philosophical
sense.
I
struggled
through
my
rough
drafts
on
the
question
of
when
a
human
being
attains
personhood
and
all
the
legal
rights
associated
with
being
a
person.
My
WA
helped
me
tremendously
and
I
managed
to
receive
a
A-
in
the
course.
I
do
think
that
the
topics
I
was
asked
to
write
about
in
my
freshman
year
seminar
were
extremely
difficult;
therefore,
I
was
happy
with
my
papers.
However,
in
my
sociology
class
we
were
asked
to
write
a
twelve
page
paper
on
any
topic
we
chose.
I
chose
to
write
about
my
families
divorce
and
I
tried
to
explain
my
mothers
behavior
at
times,
as
being
a
result
of
society's
view
on
feminism
and
its
effect
upon
her.
I
truly
thought
my
paper
was
brilliant,
and
I
completely
disagreed
with
the
C+
that
I
received.
This
was
the
first
time
I
could
not
understand
a
grade,
even
after
I
had
a
conference
with
the
teacher
and
he
had
explained
his
reasoning.
Of
all
the
styles
introduced
to
me
my
freshman
year,
I
like
the
style
I
learned
in
my
freshman
English
class
second
semester
the
most.
I
learned
to
express
my
opinion
about
a
controversial
issue,
such
as
the
new
fat-free
food
craze,
using
sarcasm.
It
is
an
approach
that
many
journalists
use,
and
I
feel
it
is
very
effective.
My
sophomore
year
I
didn't
encounter
any
new
ways
of
writing
in
my
English
class
and
VAST
class,
and
I
didn't
struggle
half
as
much
as
I
had
my
freshman
year.
I
did
have
to
start
writing
more
essays
in
Spanish.
I
felt
restricted.
It
was
much
harder
to
express
myself
in
another
language
with
my
limited
vocabulary.
I
spent
half
of
my
summer
in
Mexico
and
picked
up
many
more
descriptive
words,
and
I
am
much
more
satisfied
with
my
compositions
now.
I
feel
very
fortunate
to
have
been
given
such
a
well-rounded
education
that
enables
me
to
know
and
recognize
that
their
are
numerous
styles
of
writing
out
there.
I
only
hope
that
I
continue
to
learn
and
familiarize
myself
with
new
and
exciting
methods
of
writing.
