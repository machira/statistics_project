Returning
WA
Literacy
Narrative
ItOs
said
that
you
never
really
know
a
subject
until
you
have
to
teach
it,
and
I
never
realized
how
true
a
statement
this
was
before
becoming
a
writing
associate.
I
was
aware,
theoretically,
that
the
learning
process
and
the
teaching
process
did
not
just
run
parallel
to
each
other
but
intertwined,
but
I
never
really
had
a
true
understanding
of
what
that
meant.
Being
a
WA
has
taught
me
how
truly
the
learning
process
does
inform
the
teaching
process,
as
well
as
the
other
way
around.
ItOs
certainly
a
code
switch,
to
go
from
student
to
teacher.
As
college
students,
we
have
spent
the
last
thirteen
years
at
least
playing
the
role
of
student.
We
might
know
what
the
role
of
teacher
looks
like,
or
think
we
know
what
it
entails,
but
it
is
a
completely
different
part
to
play,
and
it
can
be
uncomfortable
to
try
to
force
yourself
out
of
the
societal
code
that
you
have
become
accustomed
to.
Especially
when
you
have
to
go
from
student
to
teacher
and
then
back
to
student
again.
As
WAOs,
there
are
positives
and
negatives
to
having
to
jump
back
and
forth
between
the
two.
On
the
one
hand,
you
can
start
out
your
conferences
on
more
equal
footing
.
Students
can
talk
to
you
as
what
you
are
-
another
student.
They
can
more
freely
express
to
you
concerns,
discuss
ideas
without
feeling
too
much
pressure
to
come
off
as
the
smartest
kid
in
the
class,
and
treat
you
as
a
friend,
because
you
might
become
one.
On
the
other
hand
though,
this
can
lead
to
some
anxiety
on
the
part
of
the
WA.
Especially
as
a
new
WA,
you
want
the
student
to
feel
like
they
can
trust
your
judgement.
You
donOt
want
them
to
question
your
credibility,
because
you
donOt
have
the
built-in
guarantee
that
you
might
as
an
actual
teacher.
You
know
that
you
know
what
youOre
talking
about,
and
you
want
to
be
sure
that
your
students
know
that
too.
I
know
that
this
was
one
of
my
biggest
concerns
during
some
of
my
first
meetings.
Especially
because,
as
it
turned
out,
I
had
an
exceptionally
NsmartO
class.
Many,
IOd
say
most,
of
the
papers
I
received
were
remarkably
good,
better
than
IOd
expected.
And
because
there
werenOt
as
many
of
the
obvious
errors
as
I
had
anticipated,
I
struggled
to
come
up
with
facilitative
questions
to
ask
during
the
conference.
But
of
course,
as
a
writer,
IOm
compulsively
nitpicky,
so
there
was
always
something
to
discuss.
And
what
I
found
myself
doing
a
lot
of
the
time
was
veering
away
from
honing
in
on
specific
sentences
and
discussing
their
structure,
and
instead
talking
about
the
topic
of
the
paper
in
general.
Most
of
my
students,
and
I
was
probably
very
lucky
in
this,
already
knew
how
to
structure
a
paper,
creating
a
logical
flow
of
ideas
and
backing
up
arguments
with
concrete,
specific
examples.
So
I
would
spend
the
first
few
minutes
going
over
my
small
tweaks,
making
sure
they
knew
why
I
believed
that
this
or
that
change
would
improve
the
progression
of
their
ideas,
and
then
I
would
begin
to
ask
them
questions
about
the
topic
itself.
The
class
that
I
was
WAing
for
was
a
freshman
year
seminar
about
the
politics
of
abortion,
so
we
were
never
at
a
loss
for
topics.
What
I
would
try
to
do
was
either
find
small
holes
in
their
argument,
the
gaps
where
more
explanation
was
needed,
their
persuasive
technique
was
thin,
or
the
places
where
their
thinking
could
be
extended.
I
noticed,
when
reading
the
first
batch
of
papers,
that
there
were
questions
running
through
my
mind
that
I
was
dismissing
because
I
assumed
they
were
simply
cropping
up
due
to
my
lack
of
knowledge
about
the
topic
(the
topics
were
often
court
cases
that
I
hadnOt
read
-
as
per
WA
regulation).
At
least,
until
I
realized
that
a
lot
of
the
time
this
wasnOt
the
case
-
I
began
paying
more
attention
to
my
own
questions,
writing
down
the
ones
I
thought
were
really
pertinent.
I
allowed
them
to
be
driven
my
pure
curiosity
and
interest
in
the
topic.
If
something
was
interesting
enough
that
I
wanted
to
know
more
while
reading
about
it,
it
was
potentially
worth
expanding.
And
in
meetings,
I
found
that
the
questions
which
I
had
thought
to
be
purely
self-indulgent
actually
unearthed
the
best
material.
A
student
would
be
talking,
explaining
or
just
reflecting
on
something
they
remembered
from
class
because
it
caught
their
interest
and
IOd
be
able
to
ask
NWell,
do
you
think
that
supports
anything
you
say
in
your
paper?O
Because
sometimes
a
fresh
pair
of
ears
to
point
you
in
the
right
direction
can
be
invaluable.
Sometimes,
a
student
would,
in
their
paper,
be
attempting
to
concisely
explain
a
complex
or
convoluted
law,
and
instead
of
trying
to
clarify
what
they
already
had
on
the
paper,
IOd
turn
it
over
and
ask
them
to
explain
it
to
me
verbally.
When
they
were
done,
IOd
say,
Nwrite
that.O
Or
IOd
write
it
down
for
them
next
to
the
original.
Because
I
found
that
sometimes
speaking
it
verbally
is
the
best
way
to
simplify
a
point.
That
technique
started
while
reading
one
paper
in
which
it
was
important
that
I
understand
one
of
the
philosophies
a
student
was
attempting
to
describe,
but
their
explanation
was
so
fragmented
that
I
just
asked
them
to
explain
it
to
me
once
in
their
own
words,
and
then
we
would
work
on
putting
it
down
on
paper.
What
they
told
me
though,
while
they
were
uninhibited,
just
talking
to
me
like
they
were
explaining
it
to
anther
student,
was
such
a
remarkably
clear
explanation
that
I
encouraged
them
to
use
it
almost
verbatim.
And
thatOs
a
technique
IOve
now
adopted
for
myself.
When
something
is
sounding
all-over-the-place,
and
IOm
resorting
to
using
big
words
that
donOt
quite
fit
but
take
down
the
word
count
of
a
sentence
IOll
stop,
step
back,
and
think,
Nhow
would
I
explain
this
were
I
just
sitting
around
talking
about
the
class
with
a
friend
over
coffee?O
It
almost
always
helps.
Of
course,
the
other
way
around
helps
too.
In
that
instance,
teaching
helped
me
to
be
a
bit
of
a
better
student,
but
since
as
a
WA
what
weOre
really
ultimately
trying
to
teach
is
how
to
be
a
good
student,
it
helps
if
you
are
one.
It
definitely
gave
me
more
confidence
during
that
first
round
of
conferences
knowing
that
IOm
a
good
writer
already,
and
just
trying
to
impart
the
skills
that
IOve
gathered
over
my
years
at
school
would
be
valuable.
IOm
sure
every
WA
has
told
at
least
one
of
their
students
to
read
their
papers
to
themselves
out
loud
to
proof
read.
All
teachers
say
it
too.
I
say
it
in
every
one
of
my
meetings.
Because
itOs
a
silly
trick,
and
often
when
itOs
suggested
it
goes
in
one
ear
and
out
the
other,
but
if
youOve
tried
it,
it
works
like
nothing
else.
There
are
some
universal
tricks
like
this
that
seem
to
work
no
matter
the
assignment,
no
matter
the
student.
But
really
itOs
sort
of
silly
to
pretend
that
there
is
one
approach
that
works
for
every
student.
We
are
all
individuals,
and
individual
learners.
It
quickly
became
a
very
important
part
of
my
routine
to
read
studentsO
papers
before
meetings
more
than
once.
First,
a
close,
slow
reading
with
a
highlighter,
marking
off
sections
and
writing
down
lengthy
initial
notes.
The
second
reading
would
be
for
anything
I
missed
the
first
time,
and
then
I
would
come
up
with
hopefully
facilitative
questions
to
ask
during
conferences.
It
was
important
to
me
to
know,
at
least
at
first,
where
the
meeting
was
going
and
the
points
I
felt
it
was
important
to
help
them
get
to.
And
after
the
first
meeting,
these
questions
depended
a
lot
on
who
the
student
was
as
well.
I
took
note
of
what
their
past
writing
had
looked
like
as
well
as
what
their
past
meetings
had
been
like.
I
had
at
least
one
student
who
would
listen
to
my
comments
attentively,
nodding
politely,
and
clearly
too
nervous
about
doing
well
and
turning
in
an
A-grade
paper
to
really
absorb
any
of
what
I
was
saying.
So
for
her
meetings,
I
stopped
making
comments
almost
altogether,
and
turned
to
asking
questions,
making
sure
she
was
really
engaging
with
what
she
was
writing.
Some
students
though
responded
really
well
to
commentary.
If
I
made
a
statement,
they
would
ask
specific
questions
to
help
them
further
their
own
understanding.
These
were
the
kind
of
students
though
who
might
veer
off
into
tangent
territory
if
I
asked
too
general
a
question,
so
I
would
keep
things
specific
with
them.
This
wasnOt
something
that
had
occurred
to
me
before
I
started
having
conferences
-
that
there
wasnOt
a
formula
for
the
best
WA
conference.
I
thought
that
for
each
paper
I
might
come
up
with
a
set
of
questions
that
would
be
beneficial
to
every
student,
that
their
would
be
a
Nbest
questionO
to
ask
for
each
essay
assignment,
and
that
I
just
had
to
be
smart
enough
to
find
it
or
come
up
with
it.
But
thereOs
so
much
variation
between
what
each
student
needs.
They
all
had
different
strengths
and
weaknesses,
all
were
different
types
of
learners,
each
had
their
own
opinions
and
angles
from
which
they
saw
the
fairly
volatile
issues
that
were
being
discussed
in
a
class.
So
my
conception
about
what
a
successful
WA
conference
looks
like
moved
from
me
thinking
about
myself
-
asking
good
questions,
knowing
the
right
way
to
respond
to
theirs
-
to
thinking
about
the
student.
Did
they
get
what
they
needed
out
of
this
conference?
Did
they
get
all
of
their
questions
answered
and
their
anxieties
allayed
at
least
somewhat?
Did
we
have
a
discussion
that
is
going
to
be
beneficial
to
the
development
of
their
paper?
And
also,
did
I
make
them
feel
comfortable
enough
that
they
could
come
and
talk
to
me
if
they
had
any
other
questions?
Because
I
ended
up
with
such
a
high-achieving
class,
all
of
my
students
made
good
use
of
their
WA
conferences,
but
I
sought
to
make
the
relationship
more
casual,
since
there
was
never
a
problem
with
any
of
them
taking
advantage
of
my
flexibility
in
meeting
times.
I
wanted
them
to
be
able
to
come
up
to
me
in
the
library
to
ask
me
a
quick
question,
or
stop
on
the
quad
to
tell
me
about
some
discussion
they
had
had
in
class.
Some
I
succeeded
with,
others
I
didnOt
do
as
well
as
I
had
wanted
to.
I
found
it
really
tough
to
break
through
a
professional
exterior,
which
is
what
a
lot
of
my
students
put
up.
I
think
for
some
students,
often
really
good
students,
there
is
a
definitive
line
between
work
and
play.
This
type
of
learner
has
excellent
concentration,
and
can
devote
all
of
their
energy
to
a
task,
and
then
once
itOs
finished
can
loosen
up
again.
This
is
a
foreign
learning
style
to
me
personally,
because
as
an
English
major,
what
I
do
for
school
is
what
I
do
for
fun
too.
Read
books,
talk
about
books,
write
about
books.
So
someone
who
walks
out
of
class
and
puts
classroom
discussion
out
of
their
head
until
they
are
back
at
their
desk
for
homework
time
employs
a
way
of
learning
that
I
canOt
fathom.
I
admire
it,
because
it
has
always
seemed
to
be
very
successful,
grades-wise,
but
I
could
never
employ
it.
Which
made
it
a
real
challenge
to
work
with
kids
who
used
that
style
as
their
natural
rhythm.
Because
to
them
a
conference
was
work
time,
and
to
me
it
was
work/fun
time.
WeOre
here
to
get
work
done,
but
while
weOre
at
it,
tell
me
something
you
talked
about
in
class
that
you
just
found
really
interesting,
even
though
it
might
not
have
to
do
with
this
particular
paper.
To
me
this
is
helpful
anyway,
because
it
lets
me
get
more
of
a
sense
of
the
class
dynamic,
but
to
a
polar
work/play
learner,
thereOs
no
point
to
this
kind
of
talk.
ItOs
counterproductive,
even.
They
donOt
want
to
waste
time,
they
want
to
get
the
most
they
can
out
of
the
conference,
but
efficiently.
So,
as
in
any
relationship,
we
all
had
to
compromise.
This
was
probably
the
most
difficult
challenge
I
faced,
but
usually
what
I
would
end
up
doing
would
be
to
start
out
the
conference
with
a
more
general
question
about
the
class,
and
then
narrow
down
the
focus.
Whereas
in
my
ideal
conference,
we
started
with
the
small
things
and
got
bigger
from
there,
so
I
could
feel
out
what
topic
of
discussion
might
ultimately
yield
the
best
material.
But
it
really
doesnOt
matter
what
type
of
conference
I
like
to
lead
best,
because
itOs
more
important
what
helps
the
student
most,
and
a
hyperintense,
focused
student
would
probably
feel
frustrated
and
might
shut
down
if
I
simply
always
lead
the
type
of
conference
that
I
liked,
just
because
I
liked
it.
I
learned
a
lot
this
summer
about
how
easily
students
can
shut
down
mentally.
Over
the
summer,
I
worked
as
an
assistant
teacher
teacher
at
a
school
for
severely
emotionally
disabled
children.
The
school
had
an
extended
school
year
schedule,
so
a
lot
of
what
we
did
was
academics.
When
working
with
kids
who
often
have
a
combination
of
learning
and
emotional
disabilities,
all
of
the
rules
apply,
but
in
the
extreme.
And
it
can
take
just
one
criticism,
or
just
one
comment,
to
shut
them
down
to
the
point
where
they
wonOt
communicate
at
all
anymore,
and
certainly
arenOt
learning.
And
while
that
atmosphere
is
almost
as
opposite
as
can
be
from
the
atmosphere
of
academic
elite
we
have
incoming
at
Lafayette,
it
does
really
make
you
examine
the
way
you
teach.
I
know
going
into
this
year
IOll
be
much
more
cognizant
of
what
I
say,
because
though
an
emotionally
healthy
person
might
not
show
it
or
even
really
feel
it,
there
are
things
that
a
teacher
might
do
or
say
that
make
us
less
receptive
to
what
theyOre
trying
to
teach.
And
itOs
different
for
everyone.
Personally,
I
know
my
pet
peeve
is
a
teacher
who
writes
notes
on
the
board
in
such
a
way
that
makes
it
impossible
to
fit
them
neatly
into
a
notebook.
A
small
thing,
but
IOm
missing
notes
because
of
it,
maybe
notes
that
could
have
been
helpful,
maybe
ones
that
would
have
sparked
my
interest.
Comparatively
I
didnOt
lose
a
lot,
but
as
a
teacher
I
want
to
be
very
aware
of
the
affect
my
words
or
actions
have
on
those
IOm
trying
to
teach,
for
the
better
or
not.
I
want
to
pay
attention
to
that
detail.
ItOs
a
continual
process,
because
there
will
never
be
that
perfect
conference,
and
there
will
always
be
room
for
improvement,
but
I
want
to
try
to
improve
every
time.
When
I
was
applying
for
my
job
this
summer,
I
spoke
about
being
a
WA
during
the
interview
process,
and
it
struck
me
how
lucky
I
am
to
have
this
as
an
on-campus
job.
I
talk
about
it
all
the
time
and
tell
everyone
how
much
I
love
it.
I
hope
I
can
continue
to
be
so
lucky
in
future
employment.
But
I
think
the
reason
itOs
so
rewarding
is
the
constant
room
and
need
for
improvement.
There
is
no
place
to
stagnate,
and
you
canOt
reach
a
plateau
where
youOre
just
the
best
youOre
ever
going
to
be.
You
always
have
to
be
thinking
about
what
you
can
do
better,
why
that
question
didnOt
do
what
you
wanted
it
to,
or
how
you
encouraged
that
student
to
think
more
deeply.
ItOs
a
bit
like
the
writing
process
itself,
because
a
piece
of
writing
is
also
never
perfect,
never
completely
one-hundred-percent
finished.
And
that
was
an
important
piece
of
knowledge
for
me
this
past
year,
that
there
is
always
room
for
improvement
in
a
piece
of
writing,
so
there
is
always
room
for
help
from
us.
