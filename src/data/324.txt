A
Year
Older
and
Somewhat
Wiser
Only
a
year
ago,
I
sat
in
the
Writing
Associate
workshop
scared
and
timid.
I
thought
there
was
some
mistake.
I
was
a
sophomore;
I
had
one
English
class
behind
me;
and
now
I
was
going
to
help
other
writers?
Still
despite
my
lack
of
self-confidence,
I
eagerly
listened
to
others
speak
about
how
I
possibly
could
affect
other
writers.
Even
if
there
was
a
mistake
and
I
somehow
slipped
into
the
program,
I
wanted
to
be
a
WA
and
try
to
help
other
writers.
However,
I
was
not
prepared
for
how
other
writers
and
the
"WA"
status
were
going
to
help
and
hinder
me.
With
only
a
week
of
classes
behind
me,
I
became
a
WA.
Well,
I
had
been
appointed
a
WA
second
semester
freshman
year,
but
I
did
not
understand
being
a
WA
until
I
sat
in
the
workshop.
Suddenly,
I
felt
a
huge
pressure.
Since
I
was
now
a
WA
helping
others
with
their
writing,
I
should
also
be
a
good
writer.
With
this
is
mind,
I
encountered
the
problem
that
would
plague
me
throughout
the
year:
Did
I
have
the
right
to
offer
advice
to
other
writers?
Writing
is
a
constant
struggle
for
me,
whether
I
am
fighting
poor
grammar,
cohesion,
or
organization.
With
this
thought
always
in
the
back
of
my
mind,
I
found
I
was
often
very
timid
offering
advice
to
other
students.
My
first
WA
assignment
was
with
an
FYS.
Since
the
students
were
freshman,
I
felt
assured
I
could
at
least
help
them
with
some
new
aspects
of
college
writing.
They
did
not
let
me
down.
Every
time
I
received
their
papers,
I
could
remind
them
to
double
space,
use
a
title,
avoid
contractions,
avoid
five-paragraph
essay,
etc.
However,
I
pushed
beyond
these
little
reminders
and
tried
to
focus
on
more
complex
problems,
such
as
cohesion,
organization,
etc.
The
students
were
not
always
receptive,
and
as
I
look
back
upon
it,
I
think
it
might
have
been
due
to
my
own
hesitations.
I
would
make
suggestions
or
try
to
guide
them,
but
once
again
I
was
constantly
questioning
myself.
As
the
semester
grew
on,
my
lack
of
WA
self-confidence
collided
with
my
own
writing,
and
I
soon
learned
that
being
a
WA
and
a
student
was
going
to
be
a
difficult
balancing
task
for
me.
While
I
was
reading
others'
papers
and
being
a
WA,
I
was
also
doing
my
own
writing
and
being
a
student.
I
had
two
English
classes:
Literary
Questions
and
Modem
and
Postmodern
American
Literature.
Neither
class
was
formal
writing
intensive;
however,
in
both
classes
I
was
expected
to
either
post
daily
on
the
discussion
board
or
write
daily
journals.
Both
classes
required
a
lot
of
informal
writing
that
was
not
graded
on
structure,
organization,
etc.;
instead,
it
was
graded
on
thoughtfulness
and
intelligence.
This
new
form
of
writing
allowed
me
to
have
a
free
flow
of
thoughts
and
develop
my
ideas
without
worrying
about
many
of
my
"trouble"
writing
areas.
Also,
when
I
wrote
it
was
only
my
thoughts
and
me;
I
welcomed
the
solace.
In
addition,
throughout
the
course
of
my
Literary
Questions
class,
I
was
introduced
to
new
forms
of
literary
analysis,
and
my
thoughts
about
English
as
a
study
were
altered
and
developed.
Before
I
had
always
felt
that
my
English
professors
secretly
wanted
the
"right"
answer
to
questions
they
proposed.
When
reading
a
piece
of
writing,
I
felt
there
was
a
"right"
and
"wrong"
interpretation.
However,
the
professor
introduced
me
to
several
new
ways
to
interpret
works
and
equally
embraced
every
interpretation
despite
obvious
differences.
I
began
to
appreciate
and
embrace
the
different
interpretations
of
writing
and
felt
as
though
my
own
thoughts
had
validity.
Learning
new
literary
analysis
techniques
aided
my
informal
writings
greatly.
Instead
of
spending
time
trying
to
find
the
"right"
interpretation,
I
spent
time
developing
my
own
thoughts.
My
informal
writing
became
more
thoughtful
and
thorough.
I
felt
myself
becoming
a
new
writer,
a
more
thoughtful
writer.
I
realized
that
writing
was
not
sounding
"good,"
writing
was
sounding
"good"
and
saying
something
thoughtful
and
important
to
you
and
others.
I
felt
enlightened
as
a
writer,
and
I
wanted
to
incorporate
my
newfound
wisdom
into
my
formal
writings.
About
half
way
through
the
first
semester,
my
first
papers
were
due.
I
had
formal
papers
due
in
both
English
classes.
Even
though
I
felt
confident
about
my
informal
writing,
I
could
not
carry
this
confidence
into
my
formal
writing.
When
I
sat
down
to
write
the
paper,
my
anxieties
about
being
a
WA
and
my
own
formal
writing
difficulties
reared
their
ugly
heads.
Suddenly,
I
was
no
longer
a
free
flowing,
enlightened
writer
engulfed
in
my
own
thoughts,
I
was
a
WA
who
should
write
the
"perfect"
paper.
While
writing
these
papers,
I
did
not
feel
like
myself,
I
felt
like
a
foreigner
had
invaded
my
body
and
was
trying
to
force
the
perfect
paper.
Every
sentence
needed
to
be
perfect.
My
cohesion
needed
to
be
perfect.
This
was
the
first
time
I
felt
pressure
to
write
a
perfect
paper,
and
my
anxiety
level
skyrocketed.
I
was
completely
frantic
about
these
papers.
I
spoke
to
the
professors
about
problems
that
did
not
even
exist
in
my
paper.
The
balance
between
being
a
WA
and
being
a
student
was
nonexistent
for
me;
I
was
a
WA,
not
a
learning
student.
To
make
matters
worse,
the
FYS
had
a
paper
due
the
same
week,
so
I
was
reading
papers
and
dissecting
them
trying
to
figure
out
why
their
papers
were
successful
or
unsuccessful.
Not
only
was
I
writing
like
I
thought
a
WA
should
write
(which
I
thought
was
perfect),
I
was
trying
to
force
other
writing
styles
into
my
own.
I
became
an
erratic,
unconfident
writer,
not
the
composed,
confident
writer
I
was
when
I
wrote
informally.
Somehow
I
made
it
through
the
first
semester
of
being
a
WA.
I
was
shocked
I
had
not
sent
myself
to
the
school
psychologist
just
once
with
all
the
anxiety
I
constructed
around
writing
papers.
Also,
my
lack
of
confidence
in
my
own
writing
reflected
on
my
WA
performance.
I
felt
I
did
not
have
the
right
to
offer
advice
to
others
on
how
to
improve
their
papers,
when
I
could
not
help
myself
and
write
the
"perfect"
WA
paper.
Surprisingly,
most
of
the
problems
I
encountered
were
not
with
other
students;
they
were
within
my
own
writing
and
myself.
I
saw
myself
transform
from
being
comfortable
in
my
own
writing
to
being
uncomfortable.
I
did
not
like
what
I
became.
I
wanted
to
change.
I
wanted
to
be
my
own
writer.
I
wanted
to
overcome
my
anxiety.
Through
a
lot
of
thought
and
reflection
about
what
went
wrong
first
semester,
I
realized
several
important
things
I
overlooked
as
a
new
WA.
First,
it
became
clear
to
me
that
WAs
are
not
perfect
writers,
simply
informed
readers.
Even
though
I
had
heard
Professor
Seetch
and
Carpenter
tell
us
several
times,
"WAs
are
informed
readers,"
I
never
really
understood.
I
felt
that
in
order
to
help
other,
I
had
to
be
perfect
myself.
It
tool
almost
losing
my
mind
first
semester
constructing
"perfect"
papers
to
realize
I
was
s
student
just
like
the
people
I
helped.
I
too
needed
help
with
my
writing
and
needing
help
did
not
mean
I
could
not
help
others.
With
this
newfound
WA
wisdom,
I
decided
to
tackle
being
a
WA
second
semester
and
overcome
the
challenges
I
had
created
for
myself
Second
semester
I
had
three
writing
courses,
VAST,
Writing
for
Publications,
and
English
Literature
I.
In
these
courses,
I
was
determined
only
to
think
of
myself
as
a
student,
not
as
a
WA.
In
my
English
course,
I
only
wrote
daily
informal
journal
entries,
so
I
rediscovered
my
free
flowing
writing.
I
felt
no
pressure
to
write
perfectly;
instead
I
wrote
thoughtfully.
I
felt
liberated
as
a
writer;
however,
my
Writing
for
Publications
course
halted
my
liberation.
Publications
required
me
to
write
in
a
style
I
never
had
tried.
I
needed
to
write
with
other
peoples'
entertainment
in
mind.
Instead
of
developing
my
own
thoughts,
like
in
English
Literature,
I
was
trying
to
keep
people
who
were
not
interested
in
what
I
was
saying
captivated.
This
style
of
writing
escaped
me.
Every
class
I
tried
to
create
writings
that
would
captivate
others,
but
somehow
I
fell
short.
I
talked
in
great
depths
to
the
professor
trying
to
capture
this
style
of
writing
that
eluded
me,
but
I
never
really
grasped
the
concept.
I
was
comfortable
with
academic
writing,
not
publications.
By
the
end
of
this
course,
I
was
frustrated.
I
never
really
understood
or
achieved
this
style;
however,
I
did
improve
throughout
the
semester.
While
this
class
did
not
greatly
affect
my
writing
style,
it
did
affect
my
attitude
towards
writing.
I
realized
that
certain
styles
were
easier
for
some
to
grasp.
While
I
struggled
in
this
course,
I
saw
others
flourish
and
create
wonderful
articles.
My
appreciation
for
different
writers
and
writing
developed.
This
appreciation
helped
me
become
a
better
WA.
I
realized
that
all
people
struggle
with
writing,
and
there
are
many
different
styles
of
writing.
When
I
met
with
students,
I
realized
that
they
encountered
problems
I
had
overcome,
and
they
overcame
problems
I
encountered.
Through
this
unique
interaction,
we
could
help
each
other
become
better
writers.
Perfection
that
I
demanded
from
myself
first
semester
slipped
away,
and
writing
became
fun
for
me
again.
Writing
was
no
longer
an
unattainable
"perfect"
paper;
instead,
writing
was
learning
and
growing.
Writing
was
a
means
to
learn,
not
a
means
to
an
end.
Even
though
I
still
strived
to
create
the
best
paper
I
could,
I
did
not
want
to
create
the
"perfect"
paper,
because
I
realized
the
"perfect"
paper
would
never
exist.
My
anxiety
about
perfection
in
writing
was
overcome
not
by
succeeding
in
my
Publications
course,
but
by
encountering
many
difficulties
and
failing.
I
never
became
a
good
publication
writer,
and
I
most
likely
never
will
be,
but
I
learned
something
more
valuable.
Even
though
I
had
learned
to
balance
being
a
WA
and
a
student,
I
still
encountered
authority
issues
with
students.
Despite
watching
myself
develop
as
a
writer
and
overcome
difficulties,
I
still
doubted
my
ability
to
help
others.
I
had
gone
through
many
changes
as
s
writer
over
the
last
few
months,
and
I
was
not
sure
I
could
fully
help
others
while
I
was
still
changing.
My
authority
problems
became
clear
in
my
VAST
class.
Being
a
sophomore,
I
was
in
a
VAST,
but
I
was
also
a
WA
for
another
VAST.
Helping
my
peers
in
a
course
similar
to
the
one
I
was
taking
really
challenged
my
authority
insecurities.
I
sat
in
a
VAST
class
just
as
they
did,
and
yet
I
was
expected
to
help
them
with
their
writing?
Many
of
there
were
at
the
same
level
of
writing
as
me.
Many
of
them
encountered
the
same
problems
as
I
did.
How
could
I
offer
them
advice
that
I
myself
was
seeking?
I
really
wish
I
could
offer
some
profound
insight
into
this
issue;
however,
throughout
the
VAST
course,
I
never
really
overcame
these
problems.
To
this
day,
I
still
question
my
ability
to
help
others.
While
I
feel
I
can
help
sometimes,
other
times
I
feel
lost.
I
feel
that
I
cannot
help
all
students
to
the
degree
they
need
to
be
helped.
Throughout
this
upcoming
semester,
I
hope
to
gain
control
of
my
insecurities
and
develop
as
a
WA.
Now
a
year
older
and
somewhat
wiser,
I
will
sit
in
the
WA
workshop
as
a
veteran
WA
and
mentor
in
a
few
short
weeks.
I
look
back
and
remember
the
scared
and
timid
student
I
was
last
year.
I
look
back
and
remember
the
difficulties
I
encountered
and
overcame.
I
will
come
to
the
new
WA
workshop
a
different
person,
a
more
confident
reader
and
writer.
Yet,
I
know
I
will
see
new
WAs
with
the
same
concerns
and
problems
I
encountered.
However,
I
know
that
as
a
mentor
I
can
help
new
WAs
overcome
the
fears
and
anxieties
they
have,
knowing
that
I
had
and
still
have
some
of
the
same.
