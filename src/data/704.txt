This
past
year
as
a
writing
associate
has
been,
more
than
anything
else,
a
humbling
experience
for
me
as
a
writer.
I
have
come
to
better
understand
the
limitations
of
my
own
experience
and
skills,
and
how
those
influence
my
interactions
with
student
writers.
This
has
been
particularly
the
case
in
terms
of
my
understanding
of
the
nature
of
academic
disciplines
and
the
divides
between
them,
as
manifested
in
their
writing.
Moreover,
I
have
realized
how
the
process
of
choosing
and
refining
a
topic
is
both
central
to
writing
a
successful
academic
paper,
and
also
a
skill
which
often
requires
a
great
deal
of
experience
to
master.
In
the
fall
semester
of
this
past
year,
I
was
assigned
a
FYS
that
was
more
or
less
historical
in
nature.
As
a
history
major,
I
was
understandably
pleased,
believing
that
this
would
make
my
job
relatively
easy,
as
I
would
be
able
to
apply
my
own
academic
experience
to
my
writing
conferences.
My
partner
professor
gave
the
student
writers
a
great
deal
of
leeway
in
their
topics,
provided
that
their
were
relevant
to
the
course
as
a
whole.
While
the
student
writers
were
pleased
by
this
freedom,
I
found
it
made
my
work
as
a
WA
considerably
more
challenging.
My
first
round
of
conferences
were
over
preliminary
outlines
the
student
writers
had
developed
for
their
papers.
My
intention
in
this
round
of
conferences
was
to
help
guide
the
student
writers
towards
feasible
projects
based
on
their
topics,
perhaps
suggesting
that
the
broaden
(or
shrink)
the
scope
of
their
paper,
or
helping
their
consider
alternative
approaches
to
research
the
general
topic
they
had
chosen.
What
I
found,
however,
was
that
the
student
writers
had
become
quite
attached
to
the
ideas
of
their
outlines.
Many
of
them
had
chosen
topics
that
were
excessively
broad
for
a
five-page
paper,
treating
entire
theaters
of
war,
while
others
had
picked
biographies
of
obscure
figures
who
might
only
receive
mention
on
two
or
three
pages
of
a
single
book
in
Skillman.
Yet
others
had
chosen
topics
that
were
simply
ahistorical,
dealing
more
with
questions
of
metaphysics
than
anything
tangibly
rooted
in
accounts
of
the
past.
Yet
I
struggled
to
come
up
with
reasons
why
these
were
bad
topics.
If
a
student
writer
had
written
a
good
draft
on
any
of
these
topics,
I
would
have
been
extremely
interested
in
what
they
had
to
say.
After
some
consideration,
I
realized
why
I
immediately
reacted
negatively
to
these
topics
was
that
I
knew
that
I
could
not
write
papers
on
them.
After
a
few
years
of
writing
history
papers,
I
knew
that
wisely
choosing
a
subject
was
only
possible
if
I
considered
what
materials
were
going
to
be
available
to
me,
and
how
much
room
I
would
have
to
discuss
the
history
in
question
in
the
paper
I
was
writing.
However,
in
the
majority
of
cases,
I
found
that
the
student
writers
were
far
more
interested
in
attempting
their
initial
attempts
at
choosing
subjects
than
refining
them
further
before
writing
their
first
draft.
Not
wishing
to
be
adversarial,
I
merely
suggested
that
they
should
be
open
to
modifying
their
topics
if
they
encountered
difficulties
in
writing
their
papers.
Few
did
so,
however,
necessitating
a
number
of
conferences
in
which
student
writers
came
in
and
immediately
told
me
that
they
were
planning
on
throwing
out
the
draft
I
had
read
and
starting
over,
since
they
were
finding
their
topic
unworkable.
While
I
attempted
to
offer
them
some
guidance
towards
a
better
topic
in
this
case,
it
did
mean
that
most
of
the
student
writers
did
not
have
the
chance
to
discuss
a
draft
of
the
paper
before
they
turned
it
in
to
the
professor.
Needless
to
say,
this
was
not
an
ideal
situation,
and
most
student
writers
avoided
it
with
the
next
paper,
being
more
receptive
to
a
discussion
of
their
topics
prior
to
starting
to
write.
Clearly,
they
had
learned
something
important,
but
I
wondered
if
it
were
possible
to
help
them
discover
the
importance
of
topic-choosing
without
the
negative
effect
on
their
grades
that
(effectively)
missing
out
on
a
writing
conference
had
had.
One
thing
stuck
out
in
my
mind
as
a
possible
culprit:
the
outlines
which
the
student
writers
had
written.
Most
had
proposed
a
detailed
outline
for
their
paper
even
as
it
was
clear
they
had
not
done
any
substantial
research.
As
a
result,
they
had
stuck
to
their
plans
for
unsupportable
theses,
overly-broad
topics,
and
topics
which
(to
me)
seemed
obviously
infeasible.
Perhaps
the
answer
was
to
have
them
create
less
definite
outlines,
but
that
might
just
have
them
do
even
less
research
before
deciding
on
their
topics
and
sticking
to
them.
In
the
spring,
I
worked
for
a
partner
professor
whose
VAST
course
was
focused
on
economics,
although
not
to
the
exclusion
of
other
disciplines.
To
my
surprise,
despite
an
additional
three
semesters
of
college
experience,
the
student
writers
in
the
course
often
displayed
the
same
tendency
to
pick
topics
that
turned
out
to
be
difficult
to
transform
into
a
successful
paper.
Since
the
VAST
was
not
in
my
particular
area
of
expertise,
I
was
able
to
predict
some
of
the
challenges
the
student
writers
faced
in
researching
and
writing,
but
there
were
a
number
of
others
which
did
not
occur
to
me
until
after
the
fact.
In
and
of
itself,
this
was
not
a
problem,
since
the
student
writers
were
generally
able
to
deal
with
these
challenges
well;
I
found
them
more
willing
to
modify
their
chosen
topics
than
I
had
found
FYS
students
to
be
the
previous
semester.
This
was
a
very,
very
good
thing,
since
I
found
myself
relatively
unable
to
give
students
advice
for
how
to
resolve
these
sorts
of
problems.
Instead,
I
mainly
had
to
direct
them
towards
their
professor;
this
caused
my
conferences
with
the
student
writers
who
were
struggling
the
most
with
their
papers
to
be
the
least
effective.
I
believe
the
primary
cause
of
this
is
my
relative
unfamiliarity
with
the
disciplines
these
students
were
employing--often
economics,
but
also
frequently
sociology,
political
science,
philosophy,
and
others.
As
a
result,
I
simply
did
not
have
the
experience
to
offer
any
type
of
useful
guidance
to
these
students,
yielding
unsatisfying
writing
conferences.
However,
there
were
a
number
of
reasons
why
this
situation
developed
in
the
first
place.
First,
I
had
not
fully
considered
the
implications
of
my
partner
professor's
suggestion
that
students
should
bring
a
variety
of
approaches/disciplines
to
bear
on
their
papers.
Had
I
thought
about
this
more
thoroughly,
I
probably
would
have
asked
for
guidance
for
what
to
do
in
the
event
of
a
student
writer
facing
methodological
challenges.
I
am
not
sure
that
this
would
have
allowed
me
to
be
all
that
much
better
prepared,
but
certainly
it
could
have
helped
somewhat.
The
other
major
problem,
albeit
one
I
had
little
control
over,
was
the
very
broad
range
of
acceptable
types
of
papers
which
could
be
written
for
this
class.
Because
my
partner
professor
had
done
little
to
limit
the
ways
in
which
student
writers
might
choose
to
respond
to
the
prompts,
it
was
probably
inevitable
that
at
least
some
of
them
would
choose
approaches
that
would
not
work
out.
Perhaps
it
would
have
been
helpful
to
try
to
explain
to
them
the
importance
of
being
flexible
in
choosing
and
refining
a
topic,
but
I
am
not
sure
that
this
would
have
substantially
changed
the
outcome
of
this
assignment.
Still,
the
challenges
that
these
student
writers
faced
forced
me
to
reflect
on
how
I
had
seemingly
escaped
them
through
the
course
of
my
own
experience
as
a
writer.
To
be
sure,
I
made
precisely
the
same
mistakes
when
I
was
a
freshman.
I
routinely
wrote
less-than-stellar
papers
which
forced
the
facts
into
aligning
with
the
topic
I
had
chosen.
It
seemed
a
compromise
to
give
up
a
topic
I
had
thought
long
and
hard
about
simply
because
I
was
having
trouble
finding
enough
evidence
to
support
what
I
was
trying
to
say.
But
somewhere
along
the
line,
probably
in
part
due
to
my
experience
as
a
WA,
I
began
to
realize
that
this
approach
was
somewhat
dishonest,
since
it
would
have
been
a
far
better
representation
of
the
research
I
found
to
change
my
topic
somewhat
to
highlight
what
had
become
clearly
more
relevant
and
interesting
than
my
original
focus.
Moreover,
after
starting
to
apply
this
more
flexible
approach,
I
quickly
found
that
it
was
actually
far
easier
to
write
papers
this
way,
since
it
generally
involved
far
less
time
in
the
library
looked
for
scant
traces
of
information
on
poorly-chosen
subjects.
This
served
me
well
when
I
was
given
the
somewhat-challenging
task
of
deciding
on
a
topic
long
before
I
was
to
write
a
paper:
I
took
a
class
in
which
I
had
to
create
a
paper
proposal
in
the
first
two
weeks
of
classes
to
be
completed
later
on
in
the
semester,
including
to
be
based
on
a
trip
abroad
to
Russia.
I
scrambled
to
find
a
topic
that
seemed
suitable:
I
wanted
a
topic
that
would
be
both
small
enough
for
me
to
research
in
my
time
in
Russia
as
well
as
something
I
could
broaden
to
fill
up
the
entire
paper.
In
the
end
I
settled
on
the
Moscow
and
St.
Petersburg
subway
systems,
which
ended
up
proving
too
little
to
write
about,
but
which
I
would
later
be
able
to
broaden
into
an
essay
on
the
entirety
of
the
mass
transit
system
which
was
developed
in
the
Soviet
Union.
Meanwhile,
many
of
my
colleagues
in
the
class
had
a
far
harder
time
managing
to
make
their
projects
have
an
appropriate
scope
and
level
of
detail
for
the
parameters
of
the
assignment.
What
I've
realized
by
comparing
our
approaches
is
this:
while
many
of
the
other
students
ni
that
class
began
by
deciding
on
the
paper
they
wanted
to
write,
I
began
by
imagining
the
papers
I
would
be
willing
to
write.
I
imagined
a
variety
of
different
topics
and
scopes
that
could
be
supported
based
on
the
research
I
was
planning
on
undertaking,
and
wrote
by
proposal
broadly
enough
to
cover
all
of
these
possibilities.
Moreover,
I
did
this
more
or
less
accidentally.
Nevertheless,
it
strikes
me
as
a
useful
method
to
apply
to
the
task
of
generating
topics
in
a
general
sense.
Still,
I'm
not
sure
it's
a
lesson
that
can
be
easily
taught
without
the
experience
of
doing
some
quantity
of
research
and
learning
the
hard
way
how
important
this
type
of
flexibility
can
be.
Perhaps
student
writers
could
be
asked
to
outline
a
number
of
different
possible
papers
on
their
chosen
topic
to
make
sure
it
is
sufficiently
versatile,
but
that
(at
least
to
me)
seems
overly
artificial
and
would
probably
be
received
poorly
by
the
students
in
question.
Moreover,
a
sense
of
what
topics
(even
in
the
plural)
are
feasible
is
probably
not
possible
without
some
experience
within
the
discipline
in
which
the
paper
is
being
written,
not
only
in
writing
papers,
but
also
by
virtue
of
having
read
broadly
within
the
discipline
to
see
what
approaches
are
more
often
successful
and
which
are
more
often
disappointing.
At
least
in
my
own
experience,
having
read
some
fairly
miserable
history
books
is
very
helpful
to
understanding
intuitively
whether
a
potential
paper
topic
will
work
for
me
or
not.
Still,
I
plan
to
try
and
encourage
students
to
be
flexible
with
their
choice
of
topic
in
precisely
this
manner,
if
appropriate
to
the
assignment,
suggesting
that
they
consider
a
range
of
different
directions
in
which
their
research
could
go
before
they
complete
a
large
body
of
research.
At
the
same
time,
I
intend
to
be
careful
not
to
give
the
impression
that
those
possibilities
are
the
only
ways
to
approach
the
paper,
as
their
research
will
almost
surely
lead
them
in
somewhat
different
directions.
As
such,
I
am
starting
this
year
as
a
WA
both
with
some
new
tools
and
strategies
for
helping
student
writers,
but
also,
I
believe,
a
new-found
understanding
of
my
own
limitations
as
a
writer,
particularly
when
I
am
placed
in
situations
where
I
have
less
direct
experience
with
the
subject
material.
While
I
am
still
very
much
able
to
look
at
higher-order
concerns
of
the
paper
draft
itself,
such
as
organization,
being
audience-driven,
and
correspondence
to
the
assignment,
I
realize
now
that
I
may
need
to
spend
some
additional
time
communicating
with
my
partner
professor
in
order
to
gain
at
least
some
knowledge
of
the
probably
pitfalls
of
the
subject
material
of
the
course.
