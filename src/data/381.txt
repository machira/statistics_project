My
Literary
Narrative
Lafayette
College
Writing
Program
There
has
always
been
something
about
writing.
Putting
words
together
so
that
they
make
a
coherent
text
is
not
only
remarkable
but
also
an
entirely
satisfying
feat.
Throughout
most
of
my
life
I
have
held
some
innate
connection
with
a
pen
and
a
piece
of
paper.
The
prospect
of
a
blank
page
(especially
one
without
those
restricting
lines)
is
very
exciting;
I
view
computers
as
less
inviting
and
reserved
mostly
for
final
products.
I
have
a
collection
of
journals
that
I
have
slowly
collected
over
the
years.
Each
journal
has
its
purpose,
whether
it
is
for
personal
reflections,
philosophical
questions,
quotes,
poetry,
playwriting,
short
stories,
lists,
or
just
anything
that
I
feel
like
writing
down
at
a
momentOs
notice.
Like
my
relationship
with
writing,
my
collection
of
journals
has
changed
over
time
as
much
as
my
journalsO
contents
have.
The
first
NstoriesO
that
I
remember
actually
recording
on
paper
were
song
lyrics.
We
took
a
family
trip
to
Duck,
North
Carolina
when
I
was
in
kindergarten.
I
remember
my
dad
teaching
my
brother
and
how
to
crab.
After
growing
impatient
waiting
for
the
crabs
to
nip
on
the
piece
of
raw
chicken
attached
to
my
dangling
string,
my
dad
told
me
to
stand
on
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
we
were
on
and
to
watch
for
crabs
floating
by
with
the
current.
I
began
singing
to
myself
a
phrase
that
came
to
be
known
as
my
first
Nsong;O
NWatch
watch
watch
on
this
sideEfor
a
crab
floating
by.O
Thus,
EmilyOs
Song
Book
was
born,
which
came
to
be
filled
with
twenty
or
so
songs
of
many
different
themes,
including
dragonflies
and
broken
cars,
which
I
was
always
entirely
too
eager
to
sing
for
anybody
when
asked.
My
simple
song
lyrics
soon
developed
into
more
detailed
and
longer
writing
projects.
I
truly
realized
that
I
enjoyed
writing
creatively
when
I
was
in
5th
grade.
I
decided
to
take
a
playwriting
course
that
was
held
at
every
elementary
school
in
my
town
once
a
week
after
school.
I
knew
nothing
about
playwriting
but
I
thought
it
sounded
interesting
and
most
of
my
classmates
were
enrolling
in
the
program
as
well.
Though
it
was
in
the
form
of
playwriting,
the
program
instructors
truly
gave
me
my
first
introduction
to
the
rules
and
formalities
of
creative
writing.
Throughout
the
course
of
creating
our
own
one-act
plays,
we
had
to
formulate
various
hypothetical
conflicts
between
two
or
three
characters
and
find
resolutions
to
these
conflicts.
I
finally
wrote
a
play
about
a
troll
and
a
leprechaun
trying
to
share
space
under
a
bridge.
What
began
as
a
simple
conflict
evolved
into
a
magical
journey
through
three
different
scenes;
my
play
was
actually
even
chosen
as
the
winning
play
for
my
elementary
school.
So,
for
the
next
two
weeks
I
got
to
work
with
a
director
and
New
York
actors
to
make
my
play
come
to
life
on
the
stage.
I
learned
so
much
about
the
potential
and
power
of
writing,
the
many
ways
it
can
be
interpreted
and
the
importance
of
making
revisions.
Along
with
the
other
winning
plays
in
my
town,
my
play
was
performed
at
an
assembly
in
my
school
in
addition
to
being
performed
at
the
New
Jersey
Playwrights
Theater.
My
initial
playwriting
experience
was
so
rewarding
that
I
was
eager
to
be
a
part
of
the
playwriting
program
the
following
year.
This
year
I
was
part
of
the
advanced
course
held
at
the
New
Jersey
Playwrights
Theater
with
about
10
other
students.
I
wrote
a
play
entitled
NToo
Much
TalkingO
about
a
girl
who
always
got
in
trouble
for
talking
too
much.
My
play
was
chosen
to
be
performed
again;
it
also
was
one
of
the
elementary
school
state
winners,
so
I
got
to
skip
school
to
see
it
performed
at
the
George
Street
Playhouse
in
New
Brunswick,
NJ.
At
the
same
time
that
I
was
editing
and
helping
direct
NToo
Much
TalkingO
I
was
working
on
another
play
for
the
third-grade
class
at
my
elementary
school.
Every
year
Mrs.
SkyrpaOs
third-grade
class
put
on
an
educational
play
involving
every
student
in
the
class
in
front
of
the
whole
school.
This
year
she
asked
if
I
would
be
willing
to
write
a
play
for
her
class
about
the
Liberty
Science
Center.
I
accepted
but
I
quickly
learned
how
different
and
difficult
it
was
to
write
a
play
with
23
different
characters
instead
of
three.
The
play
was
called
NThe
Case
of
the
Missing
Hissing
CockroachesO
and
once
I
got
the
hang
of
creating
such
a
different
type
of
play,
I
had
so
much
fun
inventing
characters
for
the
students;
there
were
two-headed
snakes,
extravagant
museum
keepers
and
of
course,
cockroaches.
I
even
got
the
opportunity
to
watch
my
play
be
performed
at
the
Liberty
Science
Center,
which
will
be
an
experience
I
will
never
forget.
Overall,
my
elementary
playwriting
experience
not
only
left
me
with
unbelievable
understanding
and
knowledge
but
it
also
introduced
me
to
the
pleasure
that
writing
can
essentially
produce.
After
my
sudden
exposure
to
this
genre
of
creative
writing,
I
found
that
writing
became
an
essential
part
of
who
I
was.
Once
I
entered
private
school
in
seventh
grade
and
playwriting
courses
conflicted
with
my
after-school
schedule,
I
started
writing
plays
and
stories
on
my
own.
I
would
lie
awake
late
into
the
night
dreaming
up
character
personalities,
details
and
possible
story
events.
I
began
writing
a
few
Nnovels,O
which
really
only
turned
into
twenty-paged
exercises.
As
much
as
creative
writing
stimulated
me
at
this
time
in
my
life,
I
did
not
find
more
formal,
NacademicO
writing
as
exciting.
Writing
responses
to
Faulkner
and
Shakespeare
was
more
of
a
task
than
an
inspiring
project.
I
was
fortunate
to
have
some
truly
amazing
English
teachers
in
high
school
that
forever
affected
my
relationship
to
writing.
In
9th
grade,
my
English
teacher
was
fresh
out
of
graduate
school
and
filled
with
a
contagious
energy
and
passion
about
literature.
We
read
and
wrote
about
everything
from
Macbeth
to
the
childrenOs
book,
Ramona
the
Pest;
she
had
us
explore
the
relationship
of
music
and
art
to
writing
and
exposed
me
to
the
value
of
good
quality
classroom
discussion.
For
my
American
Literature
class
in
10th
grade,
we
were
assigned
to
write
creatively
a
few
times,
which
thrilled
me.
I
remember
working
on
a
creative
assignment
weeks
before
it
was
due,
only
to
realize
that
my
story
was
twenty
pages
when
it
was
only
supposed
to
be
4-6
pages.
Around
the
same
time
of
working
on
these
assignments,
I
started
a
journal
just
for
poetry
and
started
writing
plays
and
stories
on
my
own
again.
It
was
11th
and
12th
grade,
however,
in
which
I
really
started
to
grow
in
my
understanding
of
literature
and
literacy,
finding
that
academic
writing
can
also
be
creative.
My
teacher
had
been
a
college
professor
who
was
a
soft-spoken,
but
opinionated
middle-aged
man
from
Minnesota;
he
was
really
intimidating.
He
told
us
at
the
beginning
of
my
11th
grade
British
Literature
class
that
he
expected
us
to
write
a
critical
essay
almost
every
week
for
the
year.
According
to
him,
writing
quality
essays
on
a
regular
basis
would
not
only
prepare
us
for
college
but
would
make
us
better
and
more
confident
writers.
And
true
to
his
word,
we
wrote
an
essay
for
him
almost
every
week
of
the
year.
It
was
the
most
NacademicO
writing
I
had
ever
done
in
a
specific
time-frame
in
my
entire
life.
It
was
also
the
first
time
in
my
academic
career
that
I
was
responsible
for
my
own
essay
topics,
a
requirement
that
was
initially
intimidating
but
eventually
feasible.
I
have
always
had
a
tough
time
writing
an
English
essay
in
a
short
period
of
time
and
even
though
I
had
to
write
an
essay
each
week
during
my
11th
grade
year,
it
still
took
me
a
long
time
to
write
each
essay.
I
did,
however,
learn
how
important
the
process
of
writing
is
to
the
overall
quality
of
a
finished
piece.
Being
somewhat
of
a
perfectionist,
it
was
always
difficult
for
me
to
sit
down
and
type
an
essay
quickly
without
constantly
editing
and
organizing
my
ideas,
language
and
sentence
structure.
My
British
Literature
teacher
taught
me
to
brainstorm
my
ideas
first
in
as
much
or
as
little
depth
as
desired;
the
more
carefully
I
organized
my
paragraph
ideas
in
rough
form
before
actually
writing
the
essay,
the
easier
it
would
be
to
sit
down
and
write
a
quick
and
well-organized
essay,
he
said.
Then,
once
I
wrote
my
essay,
I
should
edit
it
at
least
twice:
once
for
content
and
once
for
style.
Ever
since
I
learned
this
technique,
I
have
tried
to
follow
it.
I
still
have
trouble
writing
a
quick,
rough
essay
but
I
now
find
that
I
cannot
just
sit
down
at
a
blank
computer
screen
and
type
without
first
sitting
down
somewhere
away
from
the
computer
with
a
notebook
and
a
pen
and
just
brainstorming
my
ideas
into
a
solid
thesis.
I
also
now
take
the
editing
process
really
seriously;
I
obsessively
need
to
print
out
every
draft
of
my
paper
and
make
corrections
on
it
with
a
pen.
I
enrolled
in
AP
English
Literature
my
senior
year
of
high
school
with
the
same
teacher
that
I
had
had
for
British
Literature.
The
first
week
of
the
year
we
were
assigned
to
write
Nour
best
college
essayO
which
he
would
grade
as
a
mere
Nthumbs
upO
or
Nthumbs
down,O
as
his
assessment
of
whether
or
not
colleges
would
take
the
essay
seriously.
Now
understanding
my
teacherOs
writing
expectations
and
more
of
what
it
takes
to
write
a
really
good
paper,
my
expectations
for
myself
were
even
higher.
Though
he
made
us
work
really
hard
on
our
frequent
papers,
he
worked
just
as
hard
to
return
each
paper
to
us
the
next
day,
each
with
a
full
page
of
typed
comments
as
to
what
we
did
well
and
what
we
needed
to
improve,
both
on
a
class
and
on
a
personal
level.
He
was
a
tough
grader,
making
the
few
AOs
and
even
the
A-Os
we
received
feel
so
rewarding.
Some
of
my
most
frustrating
moments
were
when
I
did
not
perform
as
well
as
I
could
have
or
wished
I
had
because
of
an
issue
with
nominalization
or
an
unclear
thesis.
Some
of
the
most
challenging
assignments
were
the
two-page
critical
essays
that
we
had
to
write
at
the
end
of
the
year;
I
have
always
been
a
lengthy
writer,
so
it
was
really
difficult
to
fit
all
of
my
ideas,
clearly,
thoroughly,
but
succinctly
into
two
short
pages.
But
looking
back
on
all
the
stress
I
went
through
trying
to
write
a
NgoodO
paper,
I
realize
that
my
teacherOs
obsessions
and
my
hard
work
really
helped
me
improve
my
writing.
After
enduring
two
years
of
AP
English
and
many
years
of
challenging,
but
strong
teachers,
I
definitely
felt
adequately
prepared
for
college
writing,
at
least
for
what
was
expected
of
freshmen.
I
quickly
found
that
the
most
challenging
part
of
my
first
semester
at
Lafayette
was
not
taking
an
English
class
and
writing
essays
constantly.
Between
taking
my
FYS,
a
History
course,
and
Introduction
to
Psychology,
I
was
exposed
to
writing
genres,
such
as
critical
historical
essays,
character
biographies
and
lab
reports,
which
I
had
had
little
previous
experience
with.
I
do
have
to
admit,
though,
that
I
was
not
used
to
being
able
to
write
multiple
drafts
and
having
to
meet
with
a
writing
associate;
in
retrospect,
this
little
bit
of
Nextra
helpO
was
really
beneficial
as
it
helped
all
the
freshmen
understand
exactly
what
LafayetteOs
writing
expectations
were.
When
I
finally
took
Literary
Questions
the
following
semester,
I
was
reminded
of
why
I
enjoyed
English
so
much.
The
course
emphasized
different
types
of
literary
critique
and
demanded
that
we
write
from
various
critical
perspectives.
It
also
allowed
me
to
compare
my
high
school
writing
expectations
to
the
knowledge
and
experience
of
a
college
English
professor.
I
took
a
300-level
course
called
the
19th
Century
American
Novel
during
the
fall
semester
of
my
sophomore
year.
This
course
was
different
from
any
English
course
I
had
taken
in
a
long
time
because
we
only
were
required
to
write
three
total
papers;
most
of
our
grade
was
based
on
class
discussion.
I
did
not
do
as
well
as
I
had
hoped
on
my
first
two
papers,
forcing
me
to
meet
with
my
professor
on
a
few
occasions
and
to
assess
my
writing
issues.
After
re-evaluating
my
entire
writing
method,
I
finally
achieved
a
grade
and
an
essay
that
was
more
up
to
my
standard.
I
also
gained
a
more
advanced
perspective
as
to
what
is
required
in
upper
level
courses
and
that
sometimes
it
is
more
difficult
to
write
infrequently
than
on
a
regular
basis.
I
took
a
course
called
Black
Writers
during
the
spring
term
of
my
sophomore
year.
I
enrolled
in
the
course
because
I
thought
a
course
exclusively
on
black
authors
and
their
literature
would
be
an
eye-opening
and
interesting
literary
experience.
I
ended
up
gaining
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
writing
of
a
group
essay
with
my
professor
and
five
of
my
classmates
about
the
dynamics
of
our
unique
classroom
experiences
and
my
own
personal
reflections
about
race
and
its
various
portrayals.
Each
of
us
wrote
our
own
personal
essays
and
then
we
participated
in
a
semi-student
workshop
in
which
we
read
each
otherOs
work,
discussed
our
findings
and
wrote
a
final
reflection
about
our
assessments
of
and
our
reactions
to
one
another
on
the
given
topic.
It
was
an
extraordinary
experience
for
me,
as
it
forced
me
to
reflect
on
the
relationship
between
the
academic
and
personal
attitudes
within
the
classroom
surrounding
controversial
and
difficult
topics
and
to
compare
my
reflections
to
others.
Ultimately,
however,
I
finally
participated
in
a
project
in
which
my
love
for
creative
writing
was
integrated
into
the
academic
world.
One
frustration
I
have
had
in
regards
to
writing
as
I
have
gotten
older
is
that
this
so-called
academic
writing
has
overwhelmed
my
creative
writing.
I
still
write
in
a
personal
journal
occasionally
and
I
constantly
catch
myself
thinking
up
possible
story
themes,
but
I
either
fail
to
write
my
ideas
down
or
I
start
a
story
and
never
finish
it.
I
think
being
a
part
of
the
college
writing
program
will
be
a
very
positive
experience,
as
it
will
challenge
me
to
help
others
enhance
their
own
writing
while
I
enhance
my
own
literary
understanding.
It
will
also
force
me
to
assert
many
of
my
own
values
and
ideas
and
talk
to
others
about
a
process
that
I
usually
only
internalize.
Looking
back
over
my
time
in
school,
I
realize
just
how
much
writing
I
really
have
been
exposed
to.
In
the
past
two
years
alone,
I
have
had
to
learn
how
to
correctly
write
essays
in
different
subjects
and
formats,
such
as
in
psychology,
history,
philosophy
and
economics.
Coming
into
contact
with
such
diverse
writing
styles
and
criteria
has
only
further
proven
to
me
that
there
is
never
too
much
one
can
learn
about
writing,
a
belief
that
I
think
will
only
be
confirmed
this
upcoming
semester.
