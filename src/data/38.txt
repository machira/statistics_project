August

1995
Big
Time
I
wrapped
my
chubby
fingers
about
the
fat
yellow
pencil.
Everything
was
Big
in
kindergarten.
The
crayons
were
enormous.
The
cardboard
building
blocks
we
fought
over
at
play
time
were
immense.
I
thought
I
could
build
my
house.
Even
Mrs.
Croom
was
to
me
a
Giant
as
she
loomed
over
my
shoulder
watching
my
progress
(or
lack
there
of).
This
was
kindergarten.
This
was
the
Big
time.
So
there
I
sat
in
that
Big
chair
pulled
up
to
that
Big
desk
with
a
Big
pencil
in
my
tiny
hand.
The
pale
green
paper
with
the
wide
lines
was
laid
in
front.
What
an
odd
hue
for
a
sheet
of
paper?
It
always
made
me
feel
kind
of
...
queasy.
My
hand
locked
its
death
grip
about
the
pencil
turned
my
knuckles
white.
I
attempted
my
name.
I
made
a
straight
line
down
and
over
to
the
side:
an
L.
I
pushed
so
hard
that
you
might
have
thought
I
was
trying
to
bore
a
hole
right
through
the
desk.
I
continued
with
the
e
and
the
a.
Mrs.
Croom
nodded
her
approval
as
I
glanced
over
my
shoulder.
As
I
readied
my
pencil
to
perform
the
remaining
letter,
I
was
overcome
by
my
doubts.
It
was
the
h.
Why
did
it
always
come
out
backwards?
Soon
it
was
staring
up
me
from
that
gross
green
paper
completely
marring
the
three
other
perfectly
executed
letters.
Alan
Wandlowski
sat
across
from
me.
He
had
a
Big
name
and
he
could
write
the
whole
thing.
He
always
tried
to
make
me
laugh
while
I
was
drinking
from
my
milk
carton
at
snack
time.
Just
because
he
had
made
the
milk
come
out
of
my
nose
on
one
occasion,
he
was
constantly
in
search
of
a
repeat
performance.
Mrs.
Croom
put
her
hand
on
my
shoulder.
She
was
a
friendly
giant.
So
I
practiced.
Eventually
the
letters
became
words.
The
words
linked
together
and
became
a
sentence.
A
bunch
of
sentences
were
a
paragraph.
However,
it
was
not
quite
that
simple.
I
could
not
discuss
my
big
toe,
my
younger
brother
and
my
new
dirt
bike
in
the
same
paragraph.
There
needed
to
be
a
main
idea.
Now,
if
for
instance,
my
brother
ran
over
my
big
toe
when
he
stole
my
new
dirt
bike,
that
was
a
whole
other
story.
Second
Grade
ushered
in
a
new
era:
The
Book
Report.
I
had
heard
the
Big
kids
on
the
bus
discuss
at
length
this
arduous
task.
I
never
could
tell
whether
they
really
found
them
difficult
or
they
simply
did
this
to
torture
our
younger,
more
feeble
minds.
Well,
their
scam
worked
for
I
bore
a
healthy
fear
of
those
one
page
projects.
Mrs.
McCarthy
had
a
way
of
setting
us
at
ease.
She
found
interesting
ways
to
motivate
us.
Her
best
crowd
pleaser
was
her
fish
face.
She
would
purse
her
lips
together
and
fan
her
hands
out
along
side
her
face.
She
looked
exactly
like
a
goldfish
feeding
at
the
top
of
his
bowl.
The
stupid
human
tricks
worked.
Eventually,
I
whipped
off
those
snappy
little
numbers
with
ease
hoping
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
fish.
Mrs.
McCarthy
asked,
Tell
me
simply
what
you
liked
or
disliked
about
the
book
.
Sometimes
I
disliked
the
book.
I
wrote,
It
was
short
and
that
was
a
good
thing.
But,
more
often
than
not
I
found
the
literature
simulating.
Who
can
beat
Judy
Blume
when
you
are
in
the
second
grade?
The
next
major
step
in
my
illustrious
writing
career
occurred
in
the
fourth
grade
as
Mr.
Shawnbocker
carefully
guided
me
through
my
first
research
paper.
I
vividly
remember
the
trip
to
the
McCroy's
to
purchase
note
card
and
a
file
box
(mine
had
Snoopy
on
the
lid).
The
Encyclopedia
Brittanica
served
as
my
main
source
of
information.
I
was
schooled
to
the
proper
way
to
set
up
a
note
card.
I
learned
the
ins
and
outs
of
a
Bibliography
in
which
the
proper
placement
of
the
commas
and
periods
did
and
still
do
present
a
huge
problem.
Generating
those
two
pages
packed
with
information
seemed
like
an
impossible
task.
We
worked
in
stages
only
handing
in
small
portions
at
a
time.
Mr.
Shawnbocker
was
a
very
neat
man.
I
remember
recopying
my
note
cards
to
hand
in
to
him.
I
knew
it
had
to
be
a
certain
way
to
meet
with
his
approval.
I
can
recall
all
the
hard
work
that
went
into
that
paper,
however,
I'm
unable
to
drag
from
the
depths
of
my
memory
the
topic.
I'm
sure
I
chose
some
small,
furry
woodland
creature
to
write
about,
but
whether
it
was
a
squirrel
or
chipmunk,
I
can
not
say.
After
receiving
favorable
results
on
my
meticulously
executed
research
paper,
My
grammar
school
years
came
to
a
close.
I
ventured
away
from
the
red
brick
edifice
with
a
report
card
full
of
Os
(which
stood
for
outstanding)
accompanied
with
small
notes
of
praise
from
former
teachers.
I
left
the
familiarity
and
comfort
of
a
small
classroom
and
was
transported
to
the
Middle
School.
The
Big
kids
went
to
the
Middle
School.
Each
grade
was
divided
into
two
teams
of
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
kids.
There
were
five
teachers
in
each
team
requiring
the
students
to
rotate
every
forty
minutes.
It
was
comparable
to
Tag
Team
Wrestling.
The
teacher
grappled
with
one
group
until
the
bell
sounded
and
the
next
opponent
was
tossed
into
the
ring.
I
was
never
that
physical,
but
a
student
had
to
be
aggressive
in
order
to
receive
attention.
The
system
also
had
its
fair
share
of
Pro
Westlers,
excuse
me,
I
mean
teachers.
Mr.
Steven's
was
the
first
to
introduce
me
to
creative
writing.
He
had
written
a
wonderful
short
story
that
he
shared
with
us.
He
had
recently
struck
a
deer
on
one
of
the
rural
routes
to
school.
The
deer
suffered
some
injuries
and
Mr.
Stevens
stopped
to
see
what
he
could
do.
The
frightened
animal
fled
into
the
nearby
field.
He
dubbed
the
animal
Super
Deer
claiming
that
he
could
still
spot
the
animal
on
account
of
a
missing
patch
of
fur.
He
added
that
he
wished
that
the
deer
was
super
enough
to
pay
for
the
damages.
I
was
simply
delighted
by
the
story
and
thought
that
Mr.
Stevens
was
bound
to
become
this
famous
author.
I
was
happy
just
to
say
that
I
knew
him.
Another
exciting
development
during
the
Middle
School
years
was
the
use
of
the
pen.
It
was
then
that
we
were
first
granted
permission
for
a
more
permanent
writing
utensil.
It
was
great.
All
those
pens
looked
really
cool
in
your
backpack.
Now,
we
had
a
choice:
there
was
either
blue
or
black
ink
with,
of
course,
red
being
reserved
for
the
teacher.
I
would
love
to
know
who
designated
red
ink
as
the
official
mark
of
the
school
teacher.
Eventually,
erasable
pens
came
on
the
scene
and
there
was
some
discussion
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
be
allowed.
The
erasable
pen
was
mandated
and
quickly
I
was
sporting
that
bluish
smudge
mark
on
the
side
of
my
hand
and
the
sleeves
of
my
clothes.
I
learned
that
technology
has
its
price.
The
Middle
School
years
passed
quickly
and
I
stood
on
the
threshold
of
another
journey:
High
School.
I
knew
there
were
definitely
Big
kids
there.
Scranton
Preparatory
School
looked
rather
ominous
with
its
stone
spires
reaching
toward
the
sky.
As
I
stood
in
front
of
it
in
my
white
knee-hi
socks
and
gray
wool
uniform
skirt,
I
thought
I
had
never
seen
a
bigger
place
in
all
my
life.
Inside
its
doors
I
found
people
that
would
shape
my
young
world
both
academically
and
socially.
Mrs.
Kuhn
was
my
English
teacher
in
the
eleventh
grade.
She
had
a
particular
fondness
for
selecting
a
student's
work
and
reading
it
out
loud
to
the
class.
Anyone
that
has
been
subjected
to
this
weird
torture
can
sympathize
with
this
scenario.
You
recognize
the
piece
as
yours
after
the
first
few
lines.
You
blank
the
rest
out
because
you
are
trying
desperately
to
remain
inconspicuous.
You
know
that
you
fellow
student's
eyes
are
roving
about
the
room
in
an
attempt
to
identify
the
author.
You
sit.
You
hope
the
red
spot
is
not
forming
on
your
cheek.
Heck,
you
may
just
be
out
right
sweating.
Finally
the
voice
trails
off.
You
wait
for
the
response
which
can
leave
you
in
state
of
either
sadness
or
euphoria.
In
my
case
the
paper
met
with
laughter.
I
made
them
laugh
which
was
my
intention,
otherwise,
I
might
have
been
scarred
for
life.
The
sound
of
their
laughter
was
so
pleasant
that
I
realized
I
wanted
people
to
always
find
some
sort
of
humor
in
something
I
wrote.
Mrs.
Kuhn
indicated
to
the
class
that
the
paper
was
mine.
I
grinned
like
the
Cheshire
cat.
Not
all
of
my
high
school
writing
experiences
were
this
sunny.
My
senior
year
I
faced
the
toughest
teacher
in
the
school.
I
was
told,
With
her
it
is
simple.
She
either
likes
or
she
doesn't.
I
unfortunately
found
myself
in
the
latter
of
her
two
categories.
I
hacked
my
way
through
the
first
quarter
with
miserable
results
at
best.
No
matter
how
I
wrote
my
papers,
she
always
found
fault.
I
learned
that
sometimes
you
are
just
at
the
mercy
of
the
red
pen.
You
choose
words
and
structures
that
you
hope
will
defend
your
point
only
to
discover
that
someone
has
bled
on
your
creation.
My
father
told
her
in
a
conference,
Leah
writes
the
way
she
speaks
.
To
which
she
responded,
We
don't
do
that
here.
That
statement
still
puzzles
me.
I
will
say
she
made
me
a
better
writer
by
challenging
me.
My
grammar
improved
noticeably
along
with
my
organization
and
structure.
I
did
evoke
an
emotion
in
this
woman,
however,
it
was
not
a
laugh.
I
believe
it
was
more
of
a
wince.
I
was
glad
when
the
year
came
to
a
close.
The
stress
of
applying
to
college
had
dissipated.
The
forms
had
all
been
completed
and
mailed
(in
triplicate).
The
college
essays
had
been
written,
reviewed
and
rewritten.
My
whole
mission
was
to
write
one
that
could
fit
every
possible
scenario.
The
simple
addition
or
omission
of
a
sentence
created
a
whole
new
tone.
My
decision
was
made.
The
proper
forms
were
again
completed.
The
check
was
sent.
I
matriculated
to
the
Hill
in
the
Fall
of
1992.
I
was
not
homesick
a
day.
Yes,
it
was
during
one
of
those
bygone
semesters
at
Lafayette.
Before
first
year
seminars.
Before
BYOB.
Before
entering
my
profession
a
writing
assistant.
As
an
eager
first
year
student,
I
wandered
into
Professor
Smith's*
English
110.
It
was
in
that
small
closet
in
the
basement
of
the
Simon
Center
that
I
learned
a
great
deal
about
being
an
effective
and
hopefully
interesting
writer.
We
were
assigned
a
personal
essay.
The
first
time
around
there
were
no
restrictions
placed
on
us.
I
handed
the
paper
in
and
was
fairly
pleased
with
what
I
had
done.
The
professor
was,
likewise,
fairly
pleased.
The
word
revision
took
on
a
whole
new
meaning
as
we
changed
the
point
of
view
or
narrowed
the
time
frame.
Each
draft
revealed
new
techniques
and
new
possibilities.
The
paper
that
began
as
my
general
reactions
to
community
service
experience
evolved
into
a
short
story
about
my
interaction
with
one
particular
child
on
one
particular
day.
The
feedback
I
received
from
both
the
professor
and
my
peer
editors
was
extremely
beneficial.
*
The
names
have
been
changed
to
protect
the
...
I'll
let
you
be
the
judge.
On
a
subsequent
project
the
professor
grouped
us
in
teams
for
a
research
project.
We
became
investigative
reporters
uncovering
our
information
in
musty,
old
archives.
We
even
conducted
interviews.
We
created
a
mock
of
The
Lafayette,
the
school
paper,
with
the
help
of
some
innovative
computer
software.
I
began
using
the
computer
in
high
school
for
papers.
By
the
time
I
reached
Lafayette,
I
was
almost
codependent.
I
found
it
difficult
to
write
a
paper
without
the
benefit
of
the
illuminated
screen
and
flashing
cursor.
This
paper
in
particular
sported
some
cool
clip
art
and
was
laid
out
just
like
a
real
paper.
Our
work
received
praise.
My
first
experience
in
the
Big
Time
at
Lafayette
proved
to
be
quite
positive.
Our
fearless
leader
navigated
us
through
the
rough
waters
of
a
first
semester
writing
course.
We
took
risks
and
experimented
with
language.
The
professor
took
risks
and
asked
interesting
questions
of
us
without
fear
of
our
responses.
I
learned
a
lot
about
the
different
approaches
that
can
be
taken
with
a
piece.
In
my
junior
year
I
boarded
a
Big
plane
to
began
a
long
planned
adventure.
I
rediscovered
the
beauty
of
the
written
word
during
my
semester
abroad.
I
spent
four
months
studying
and
traveling
in
Spain.
I
kept
a
detailed
journal
of
my
adventures
from
my
first
failed
attempted
at
locating
a
bathroom
to
the
time
I
exited
the
metro
with
my
skirt
stuck
in
the
strap
of
my
backpack
revealing
slightly
more
than
I
planned.
I
got
into
the
routine
of
writing
every
night
before
going
to
bed.
I
did
this
partly
for
my
sanity
and
also
because
I
knew
it
would
make
a
wonderful
keepsake.
The
memories
contained
within
it
are
irreplaceable.
As
I
stand
on
the
threshold
of
my
senior
year,
I
am
filled
with
mixed
emotions.
Sixteen
years
of
schooling
are
coming
to
a
rapid
close.
I
am
both
nervous
and
excited
to
see
what
I
will
make
of
all
these
hours,
books
and
papers.
I
feel
a
bit
like
I
did
in
kindergarten
staring
down
at
that
nauseating
green
paper.
Now
the
question
is
what
do
the
Big
kids
do
after
graduation?
Talk
to
me
on
May
20,
1996
and
hopefully
this
Big
kid
will
have
an
answer.
By
the
way
I
saw
my
kindergarten
teacher,
Mrs.
Croom,
recently.
I
hoped
she
didn't
notice
how
I
marveled
at
her
height.
She
measures
a
staggering
five
feet
and
one
inch.
