Paper
M.
Writing
Associate
Assignment
August
28,
1998
Throughout
my
life,
writing
has
been
an
integral
part
of
me
and
the
way
1
view
the
world.
My
love
of
writing
started
very
early
with
the
importance
that
my
father
always
placed
on
it.
He
would
encourage
me
to
read
and
observe
various
authors'
writing
styles
and
vocabulary.
1
believe
these
recommendations
fostered
my
desire
to
express
myself,
my
thoughts,
through
writing.
Looking
back
through
years
and
years
of
different
teachers,
assignments
and
projects,
1
have
come
to
see
how
my
writing
today
reflects
the
person
1
have
become.
Probably
the
earliest
memory
1
have
of
writing
was
in
first
or
second
grade.
For
some
reason
1
remember
distinctly
my
conscious
decision
to
begin
writing
a
book
at
that
early
age.
Even
now
1
can
draw
a
correlation
between
literature
and
writing
my
"book."
1
was
absolutely
fascinated
by
mysteries
as
a
young
child.
The
Nancy
Drew
series
and
Agatha
Christie
novels
were
by
far
my
favorites.
My
parents
used
to
read
to
me
and
1
adored
the
opportunity
that
mysteries
allowed
for
suspense
and
brain
teasing.
It
was
around
this
time
I
started
on
my
own
mystery
novel;
it
was
to
be
entitled
The
Magic
Tree.
I
really
did
not
have
formal
writing
techniques
of
any
sort,
for
I
had
not
been
given
instruction
in
school
yet.
1
simply
modeled
my
own
work
after
the
books
that
I
had
read--introduction
of
characters,
connection
to
some
event
that
draws
them
to
a
secret
and
then
the
unraveling
of
the
mystery.
Although
1
was
motivated
to
write
an
entire
book,
I
only
got
through
chapter
4
and
realized
that
the
story
was
over;
it
was
no
longer
interesting
me.
1
definitely
needed
some
organizational
advice
and
that
is
precisely
what
1
was
taught
as
1
grew
older.
In
fifth
grade,
1
had
a
teacher
named
Mrs.
Burge.
She
was
a
woman
with
a
reputation
of
being
incredibly
stubborn
and
downright
nasty
about
everything
from
assignments
to
not
allowing
snack
time.
When
1
originally
received
notice
that
I
in
fact
had
Mrs.
Burge,
1
cried.
At
the
time,
1
had
no
idea
that
this
woman
with
a
horrible
reputation
would
give
me
what
1
needed
to
succeed
academically
throughout
middle
school.
The
characteristic
of
Mrs.
Burge
that
every
fifth
grader
confused
with
meanness,
was
simply
her
unwillingness
to
continue
treating
us
like
children.
She
knew
how
all
the
other
teachers
taught,
but
she
believed
that
we
needed
to
have
a
firmer
grasp
of
concepts
and
to
develop
more
of
a
work
ethic
before
we
arrived
in
the
middle
school
that
next
year.
Throughout
the
year
we
had
several
assignments,
many
more
than
the
students
did
in
other
classes,
but
the
last
one
proved
to
be
the
biggest
challenge.
It
was
the
first
real
research
paper
that
1
had
been
assigned.
Each
of
us
was
to
pick
an
event
from
history
and
write
a
seven
to
nine
page
paper,
typed
of
course,
with
everything
from
a
title
page
to
a
bibliography.
I
chose
World
War
II
and
1
immediately
found
sources,
composed
an
outline
of
the
paper
and
wrote
all
pertinent
facts
on
3X5
index
cards
the
way
we
had
been
shown
in
class.
I
found
that
I
actually
enjoyed
the
research
that
my
paper
entailed.
Instead
of
dreading
the
assignment,
1
began
looking
forward
to
my
time
during
the
day
that
1
devoted
to
continuing
the
task
at
hand.
After
I
had
finished
and
turned
in
my
paper,
I
had
an
overwhelming
sense
of
accomplishment.
From
start
to
finish
that
project
was
purely
my
research,
hard
work
and
time.
1
understood
why
Mrs.
Burge
was
so
hard
on
us
only
once
1
moved
on
from
her
classroom--she
wanted
us
to
be
one
step
ahead
of
the
others
upon
entrance
into
sixth
grade
and
hopefully
we
would
maintain
that
edge
as
we
got
older.
To
this
day,
1
credit
my
fifth
grade
teacher
for
making
each
and
every
one
of
her
students
work
like
adults
instead
of
children.
Although
the
middle
school
era
was
not
my
most
prolific
period
when
it
comes
to
writing,
1
must
admit
that
1
learned
what
1
needed
to
advance
my
writing
skills
in
preparation
for
high
school.
In
seventh
grade
I
enrolled
in
an
advanced
English
course
whose
main
focus
was
writing,
listening
and
speaking.
The
tediousness
of
the
course
really
detracted
from
the
subject
matter.
We
were
supposed
to
become
more
informed
writers,
listeners
and
speakers.
Emphasis
was
not
placed
on
the
"big"
picture
but
on
the
most
minute
of
details
that
really
did
not
have
to
be
repeated
day
in
and
day
out.
We
all
were
taught
the
importance
of
clarity
in
writing
and
were
given
the
particulars
of
paper
preparation.
Although
my
teacher
taught
us
the
basics,
that
is
really
where
he
stopped.
Never
at
any
time
during
the
course
were
we
asked
to
put
all
we
had
learned
together
to
create
a
final
piece.
In
eighth
grade,
I
had
two
courses
that
were
primarily
geared
toward
writing.
One
was
my
English
class
and
the
other
was
focused
solely
on
writing.
My
English
teacher,
Mrs.
Bohlin,
focused
in
on
our
creative
abilities
and
for
the
first
time
really
forced
us
to
become
creative
writers.
1
did
obviously
have
experience
with
creative
writing,
but
1
had
for
so
long
been
in
research
mode
and
was
involved
in
hard
evidence
type
of
writing
that
1
really
did
not
know
where
to
begin.
One
day
each
week
we
would
travel
to
the
computer
lab
to
type
out
whatever
assignment
we
happen
to
be
working
on.
At
the
end
of
the
year,
Mrs.
Bohlin
made
each
of
her
students
a
book
of
sorts,
with
laminated
papers
attached
to
one
another
with
a
plastic
spiral.
The
final
product
was
really
something
we
could
all
be
proud
of.
In
my
other
writing
course
that
year,
we
concentrated
on
personal
journals
and
stream-of-consciousness
writing.
1
loved
the
freedom
to
write
whatever
I
pleased
in
my
journals
but
1
really
did
not
get
much
out
of
the
course.
1
found
that
the
courses
that
I
enjoyed
most,
no
matter
what
subject,
tied
everything
together
at
the
end.
It
really
makes
no
sense
to
learn
lessons
out
of
context
without
giving
a
proper
situation
in
which
they
can
be
used.
1
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
courses
that
at
least
attempt
to
relate
lessons
to
a
bigger
picture
have
been
the
most
effective
or
have
the
potential
to
be
effective.
1
think
that
my
most
valuable
writing
experiences
during
the
middle
school
occurred
when
1
went
away
to
camp
the
summer
after
eighth
grade.
I
made
a
point
of
being
completely
honest
in
my
journals
where
I
was
able
to
express
my
concerns
without
letting
anyone
in
on
my
personal
thoughts.
In
my
letters
home
I
was
able
to
describe
lucidly
what
was
taking
place
and
whether
or
not
I
enjoyed
what
was
happening.
Because
it
was
really
my
first
time
away
from
home,
I
relied
on
my
journal
entries
and
letters
to
keep
my
mind
off
being
homesick.
My
writing
brought
me
closer
to
those
I
missed
and
somehow
I
was
not
as
sad
after
putting
my
emotions
on
paper.
I
had
not
realized
until
that
point
how
therapeutic
writing
could
be.
In
most
of
my
English
classes
throughout
high
school,
I
was
assigned
to
keep
a
journal
as
part
of
the
requirements
of
the
courses.
Once
again
I
shared
my
feelings,
thoughts
and
emotions
very
openly
each
day
during
our
ten
minute
"free
write."
Though
our
journals
were
private
and
never
read
by
our
teachers,
we
did
have
to
occasionally
extract
something
that
came
up
in
our
journal
entry
and
expand
on
it
in
a
paper
of
sorts.
In
writing
journals
or
stream-of-consciousness
pieces,
interesting
ideas
and
great
beginnings
to
expository
pieces
show
up
periodically.
We
were
always
asked
to
sift
through
our
journal
entries
until
something
struck
our
interest
and
then
we
were
to
write
a
two
or
three
page
paper
on
the
topic.
I
thought
that
this
was
a
great
idea
because
sometimes
a
tiny
entry
will
pique
one's
interest
the
second
time
through
and
give
one
the
opportunity
to
elaborate
on
those
thoughts.
I
relied
on
journals
throughout
the
whole
of
high
school
but
especially
when
I
went
abroad
the
summer
before
my
senior
year.
I
traveled
to
Oxford
to
study
journalism
and
photography
with
other
young
adults.
Because
I
was
so
far
away
from
home,
I
was
forced
to
write
to
friends
and
family
just
to
keep
in
touch
and
I
forced
myself
to
write
in
my
journal
to
maintain
my
sanity.
There
was
no
way
I
was
going
to
be
able
to
remember
everything
I
visited,
each
of
my
thoughts
when
I
visited
them.
I
wrote
out
everything
that
I
thought,
worried
about,
saw
and
expected
for
a
month.
Every
now
and
then
I
find
that
journal
and
read
an
entry
or
two.
It's
amazing
how
many
memories
it
refreshes.
The
one
thing
I
did
not
expect
when
I
was
writing
home
that
summer
were
the
positive
responses
I
got
from
my
family
and
friends.
My
relatives
would
call
my
parents
to
say
how
impressed
they
had
been
with
the
letter
they
had
received
from
me.
Some
even
showed
my
parents
the
letters.
I
realized
then
that
I
had
greatly
improved
my
style
simply
by
doing
it
more
often.
1
began
to
really
love
and
respect
the
power
of
writing.
It
was
not
until
I
entered
Lafayette
that
I
learned
what
writing
really
was.
Up
until
that
point,
I
knew
what
high
school
level
and
superficial
writing
was,
but
now
I
was
going
to
be
thrust
into
a
whole
new
realm,
that
of
the
college
level,
academic
writer.
After
a
somewhat
lazy
last
year
of
high
school,
it
was
a
shock
for
me
to
take
the
courses
that
I
did
first
semester
of
my
freshman
year.
Almost
all
of
the
classes
I
took
revolved
around
writing
in
some
sense
of
the
word.
I
would
have
to
say
that
my
FYS
got
me
well
acquainted
with
college
writing
because
of
the
writing
associate
program.
Because
I
was
a
bit
confused
as
to
what
was
expected
of
college
freshmen,
I
simply
tried
my
best
and
asked
my
WA
what
she
thought
I
should
do
to
make
the
paper
more
powerful.
I
think
that
everyone
makes
a
huge
adjustment
when
they
are
transformed
into
a
college
writer
but
when
someone
is
there
to
aid
in
that
transformation,
the
situation
is
made
much
easier.
Since
entering
Lafayette,
I
have
bonded
with
many
of
my
professors.
I
respect
their
opinions
and
enjoy
hearing
their
advice.
I
believe
that
the
compatibility
with
the
professors
I
had
initially
at
Lafayette
helped
me
to
adjust
more
readily
to
college
writing
so
that
now
I
feel
much
more
comfortable
with
the
way
I
write.
I
realize
that
now
I
have
become
a
college
writer
and
I
am
enjoying
it
more
than
ever.
And
even
as
I
sit
here
typing
this
assignment
at
my
desk
at
home,
I
glance
to
my
left
where
a
brand
new
journal
sits.
It
was
a
birthday
gift
from
a
close
friend
of
my
family
and
on
the
inside
cover
a
message
is
written:
"For
special
remembrances
of
your
junior
year
at
Lafayette."
I
will
remember
my
thoughts,
concerns
and
special
memories
from
this
year
in
the
easiest
way
I
know
how--on
paper.
