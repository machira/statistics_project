Writing
Associate
Literacy
Narrative
I
have
been
writing
as
long
as
I
can
recall.
I
honestly
do
not
remember
the
first
time
I
put
pencil
to
paper
nor
my
first
experience
typing
at
a
computer.
Of
course,
my
early
writing
was
not
academic
work.
It
consisted
of
small
fictional
stories,
sets
of
directions
on
how
to
accomplish
things
on
the
computer,
short
letters
to
my
grandparents,
and
the
like.
In
hindsight,
I
can
discern
two
distinct
genres
of
writing
from
this
time.
Some
work
I
composed
was
purpose-driven.
That
is
to
say,
it
was
born
of
necessity.
Instructions
and
letters
to
family
fall
within
this
category,
as
they
both
have
an
extrinsic
purpose
associated
with
them.
This
is
the
part
of
my
writing
that
later
academic
work
would
draw
upon,
as
more
formal
essays
still
have
the
primary
function
of
communicating
information.
However,
some
of
what
I
wrote
early
on
had
no
such
function:
the
fictional
newspaper
I
created
comes
to
mind.
Clearly
what
drew
me
to
complete
this
undertaking
was
not
the
extrinsic
need
to
communicate
information
to
someone
else,
but,
rather,
the
intrinsic
reward
of
the
artifice
of
writing
itself.
This
is
not
to
say
that
it
was
not
a
learning
experience.
Indeed,
in
creating
the
fictional
newspaper,
I
imitated
the
form
and
style
of
real
newspaper
writing;
this
type
of
imitation
would
be
the
basis
for
much
of
my
academic
writing
for
the
following
eight
years.
Further,
it
was
this
type
of
writing,
with
its
emphasis
on
form
and
style
over
content,
that
interested
me
much
more.
I
attended
a
private
school
for
elementary
and
middle
school
which
I
suspect
has
given
me
an
experience
different
from
most
students'
in
how
I
was
taught
academic
writing.
Each
lesson
I
was
taught
was
presented
to
me
almost
strictly
orally
(though
at
times
with
the
aid
of
illustrations
drawn
on
the
chalkboard
or
demonstrations
of
scientific
principles).
The
following
day,
I
would
write
a
brief
essay,
composed
by
the
class
teacher,
into
a
blank
book
that,
by
the
end
of
the
year,
would
contain
descriptions
of
everything
I
had
learned
within
that
subject.
As
I
progressed
into
later
grades,
I
instead
used
essays
that
I
had
composed,
usually
as
homework
the
night
after
the
lesson
in
question.
This
has
had
several
impacts
on
how
I
view
and
undertake
writing.
First,
and
most
directly,
years
of
writing
essays
by
hand
(usually
using
colored
pencil
or
pen)
have
meant
that,
at
least
for
close
editing,
I
find
using
pen
and
paper
most
intuitive
and
most
effective.
Second,
the
act
of
recopying
essays
for
several
years
meant
that,
as
I
began
to
compose
my
own
descriptions
in
similar
fashion,
I
already
had
an
intuitive
understanding
of
how
an
essay
should
be
written.
To
a
certain
extent,
then,
my
early
academic
writing
was
not
based
on
an
understanding
of
rules,
be
they
grammatical,
structural,
or
stylistic.
Rather,
I
wrote
largely
by
feel,
attempting
to
create
a
finished
essay
that
had
the
same
character
as
the
examples
I
had
been
given.
Third,
the
nature
of
these
essays
was
always
to
convey
factual
information
in
an
precise
fashion;
accordingly,
I
developed
a
sense
of
what
an
essay
was
meant
to
be
which
largely
excluded
that
possibility
of
presenting
multiple,
potentially
incompatible
ideas,
whether
those
ideas
would
be
resolved
in
such
an
essay
or
not.
Finally,
the
process
of
having
my
essay
corrected
by
the
teacher
prior
to
my
writing
it
into
my
lesson
book
instilled
in
me
the
belief
that
essays
should
be
drafted
and
then
polished
to
perfection
before
I
considered
them
done.
My
teachers
largely
praised
me
on
my
ability
to
draft
essays
similar
to
theirs
in
terms
of
form
and
style,
though
they
often
expressed
frustration
at
my
inattention
to
penmanship.
It
was
not
that
I
was
incapable
of
writing
legibly,
but
rather
that
I
did
not
see
it
as
a
priority,
and
did
not
bother
to
spend
the
time
to
write
clearly.
At
some
point,
however,
I
realized
the
obvious
effect
the
visual
appearance
of
a
piece
of
writing
had
on
its
apparent
quality,
and
thus
began
to
adequately
clarify
my
handwriting.
Further,
this
realization
has
created
an
instinct
in
me
to
prefer
to
create
professional-looking
documents
when
possible.
In
fourth
grade,
each
student
in
my
class
was
given
their
first
research
project;
I
was
to
research
the
domesticated
cow
and
write
a
report
based
on
what
I
found.
The
form
of
the
presentation
was
strictly
defined
by
my
teacher,
and
so
it
was
relatively
straightforward
to
write
once
I
had
found
the
necessary
information.
Nevertheless,
I
initially
found
the
task
of
collecting
facts
from
different
sources
and
combining
them
into
a
single
narrative
somewhat
difficult,
and
this
led
me
to
create
a
particular
type
of
outline
that
I
use
to
this
day:
I
would
create
a
brief
list
of
what
points
of
information
I
wanted
to
include,
with
the
book
and
page
number
from
which
I
had
learned
each
point
placed
next
to
them.
In
this
way,
I
could
go
back
and
find
additional
related
information
if
I
needed.
Thus,
I
increasingly
thought
of
the
project
not
as
a
single
narrative,
but
as
a
structured
synthesis
of
information.
This
view
of
longer
writing
projects
served
me
well
in
later
assignments,
as
I
was
given
more
freedom
to
choose
both
the
topic
and
the
structure
of
my
projects.
This
culminated
in
a
project
describing
the
Roman
senate,
wherein
I
had
decided
what
books
to
read
for
research
based
on
a
brief
outline
I
had
made
soon
after
the
assignment
was
given
which
indicated
what
facets
of
the
senate
I
wanted
to
cover.
As
I
read
more,
I
placed
appropriate
information
within
this
outline,
causing
it
to
eventually
grow
until
it
fully
outlined
every
paragraph
of
the
overall
project.
Thus,
this
type
of
project
has
led
me
to
develop
a
habit
of
outlining
papers
before
I
begin
to
write
them,
as
I
find
I
am
often
able
to
combine
information
more
efficiently
and
in
a
more
organized
manner
when
I
do
so.
This
focus
on
organizational
structure
served
me
well
as
I
started
high
school:
my
English
class
focused
initially
on
writing
the
archetypal
five-paragraph
essay.
Although
I
had
not
previously
been
exposed
to
this
form
explicitly,
I
found
no
difficulty
adopting
it,
nor
continuing
to
use
it
as
we
began
to
explore
other
genres
of
essays,
such
as
compare-andcontrast
papers.
Rather,
the
challenge
for
me
was
to
conceptualize
essays
not
as
sets
of
organized
facts,
but
as
collections
of
related
descriptions
and
arguments
that
helped
prove
an
overall
point
or
create
an
overall
impression.
As
my
assignments
grew
in
size
and
complexity,
creating
outlines
for
them
became
more
and
more
essential.
While
I
did
not
find
this
difficult,
I
quickly
found
re-working
handwritten
outlines
time-consuming
and
error-prone.
Accordingly,
I
increasingly
began
to
type
outlines
on
a
computer,
thus
allowing
me
to
easily
edit
them.
Since
I
was
required
at
this
point
to
type
essays
and
print
them
for
grading,
I
thus
spent
most
of
my
writing
time
in
front
of
a
computer;
nevertheless,
I
quickly
found
that
it
was
far
better
for
me
to
print
a
draft
and
write
changes
longhand
on
it
and
then
make
these
changes
in
the
electronic
copy
afterwards.
I
cannot
say
whether
this
is
due
to
my
experience
editing
by
hand
for
so
many
years,
or
because
of
a
more
fundamental
difference
between
the
two
media.
Nevertheless,
in
retrospect,
I
was
still
a
very
textually
focused
writer
at
this
point:
I
spent
considerable
amounts
of
time
making
small
adjustments
to
wording,
and
relatively
little
time
revising
the
structure
of
my
papers,
let
alone
attempting
to
change
their
focuses
or
methodologies.
In
my
sophomore
year,
I
received
a
number
of
comments
from
teachers
to
the
effect
that,
while
my
papers
were
well-written
in
terms
if
style
and
grammar,
their
structure
was
difficult
to
follow.
Further,
I
began
to
write
passages
that
were
overly
complex
and
nearly
impossible
to
understand
at
first
sight,
and
this
led
my
English
teacher
to
require
me
to
re-write
an
entire
essay
and
clarify
my
language
in
the
process.
The
experience
of
doing
this
dramatically
changed
the
way
I
looked
at
writing
and
editing.
In
particular,
I
now
almost
always
make
edits
to
my
papers
which
renders
their
grammar
and
wording
simpler,
not
more
complex.
As
I
continued
in
high
school,
different
classes
introduced
me
to
various
new
forms
of
writing,
which
all
had
their
own
requirements
and
needs.
For
science
classes,
I
wrote
lab
reports
that
required
absolute
clarity
of
language,
reinforcing
the
aforementioned
lesson
in
simplicity.
For
my
literature
classes,
I
needed
to
analyze
the
books
we
read
and
comment
on
the
nature
of
their
writing.
This
analysis
of
other
authors'
writing
gave
me
a
greater
understanding
that
the
most
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind
while
writing
is
what
purpose
I
am
trying
to
serve
by
writing
to
my
audience.
Further,
the
experience
of
writing
journal
entries
based
on
texts
I
was
reading
accustomed
me
to
questioning
what
authors
were
attempting
to
achieve
with
their
writing,
and
the
means
by
which
they
were
doing
so.
This
process
of
writing
based
on
clearly-biased
sources
was
also
my
task
in
my
history
classes,
as
we
wrote
essays
combining
ideas
and
information
from
(at
times)
conflicting
sources,
attempting
to
evaluate
what
we
felt
was
most
likely
to
be
true,
in
our
judgment,
given
the
information
available
to
us.
Thus,
I
needed
to
envision
academic
writing
not
as
merely
summarizing
other
sources
in
a
concise
manner,
but
attempting
to
reconcile
seeming
discrepancies
into
a
straightforward
understanding
of
the
topic,
which
could
be
conveyed
to
the
reader.
Still,
most
of
my
assignments,
even
those
that
involved
some
amount
of
research,
were
quite
short
in
nature,
and
were
given
a
fair
amount
of
direction
from
the
teachers
that
assigned
them.
My
seminal
experience
in
a
truly
independent
paper
was
the
Extended
Essay:
a
paper
on
any
subject
of
my
choice,
completed
with
only
minimal
aid
and
direction
from
my
faculty
advisor,
and
graded
by
an
outside
entity
I
chose
to
compare
two
pieces
of
film
soundtrack
music
and
launched,
headstrong,
into
doing
so.
It
was
not
until
rather
late
in
this
process
that
I
realized
this
topic
was
not
particularly
appropriate
to
the
format
of
the
paper
I
was
supposed
to
write,
nor
did
I
really
have
the
appropriate
experience
and
skill
set
to
successfully
complete
the
paper.
Attempting
to
salvage
the
paper,
I
incorporated
more
background
material
and
attempted
to
spend
more
time
contextualizing
the
two
scores
in
question,
although
I
was
only
really
halfway
successful
in
doing
so.
Ultimately,
while
I
completed
the
paper,
I
was
not
particularly
pleased
with
it,
nor
did
it
receive
the
grade
I
had
initially
hoped
to
achieve.
Those
shortcomings
being
the
case,
I
still
learned
a
great
deal
from
the
experience
of
attempting
to
write
the
Extended
Essay.
First,
and
most
importantly,
I
learned
that
perhaps
the
single
most
important
factor
to
consider
when
beginning
to
write
a
paper
is
feasibility;
I
now
ask
myself,
aCan
I
actually
write
this
paper
with
the
materials
and
skills
I
have?a
before
I
begin
to
outline
or
even
thoroughly
research
any
paper.
Second,
I
realized
that
my
existing
system
of
outlining
was
insufficient
for
longer
papers,
and
that
that
had
wasted
considerable
amounts
of
my
time.
Accordingly,
I
now
often
outline
in
two
phases,
first
making
appropriate
notes
from
each
source,
and
afterwards
organizing
these
notes
into
a
narrative
structure.
Finally,
I
realized
more
acutely
that
the
most
important
choice
I
have
to
make
when
writing
a
paper
is
its
methodology;
that
is
to
say,
how
the
paper
attempts
to
create
meaning,
in
terms
of
what
types
of
sources
it
uses,
how
it
analyzes
those,
and
how
it
uses
such
analyses
to
create
an
overall
statement.
The
experience
I
gained
from
writing
the
Extended
Essay
would
prove
very
useful
in
my
first
year
of
college,
as
I
was
immediately
assigned
essays
wherein
I
had
quite
extensive
control
over
the
choice
of
topics
and
how
I
would
approach
them.
In
my
First-Year
Seminar,
I
wrote
a
series
of
fairly
short
papers
in
familiar
forms,
but
in
which
I
was
responsible
for
making
all
decisions
about
what
subject
to
approach
and
what
materials
and
sources
to
use.
In
light
of
my
experience
at
high
school,
I
found
this
process
quite
straightforward,
and
throughly
enjoyed
the
independence
offered
me
in
this
course.
Meanwhile,
my
first
history
course
required
me
to
complete
journal
entries
about
sources
I
had
read
in
class
or
as
homework.
This
was
similar
to
what
I
had
done
for
my
English
class
in
high
school,
but
was
slightly
more
challenging
in
nature:
rather
than
attempting
to
analyze
texts
on
a
textual
basis,
I
needed
to
analyze
the
ideas
the
the
texts
espoused
(and
those
they
presupposed),
as
well
as
understand
and
comment
on
how
these
ideas
fit
together
with
others
we
had
studied.
This
nature
of
writing
was
extended
further
by
the
paper
for
this
class,
which
consisted
of
a
review
of
an
academic
history
monograph
of
our
choice.
Not
only
did
I
thus
have
great
independence
in
chose
the
topic
of
the
paper,
I
was
also
on
my
own
with
regards
to
choosing
what
features
of
the
book
I
would
discuss.
This
initially
left
me
somewhat
bewildered
by
what
to
do,
and
led
me
to
redraft
outlines
several
times,
making
drastic
changes
each
time,
until
I
had
settled
on
a
logical
approach
to
relating
the
ideas
contained
within
the
book
to
others
I
had
encountered
during
the
course
as
a
whole.
Despite
my
initial
difficultie4s,
I
was
quite
pleased
with
the
final
draft
of
the
essay
that
I
submitted.
In
my
history
course
the
following
semester,
I
was
assigned
a
much
longer
paper
which
required
me
to
not
only
synthesize
information
from
different
sources,
but
to
create
an
entirely
new
explanation
for
historical
events,
effectively
creating
knowledge
of
a
particular
type.
Accordingly,
a
top-down
outline
of
the
paper
was
not
an
effective
starting
point,
and
I
instead
compiled
collections
of
facts
and
sources
which
would
help
underpin
my
understanding
of
the
topic
in
question.
Only
after
considering
what
information
I
found
could
I
begin
to
organize
the
paper.
Indeed,
what
I
found
was
that
as
I
organized
the
paper,
I
was
actually
gaining
new
insights
into
the
research
I
had
completed;
that
is
to
say,
I
was
using
writing
as
a
means
of
learning.
Accordingly,
I
believe
I
am
now
finding
yet
a
new
pattern
of
the
act
of
academic
writing:
I
first
collect
information
of
various
types,
then
synthesize
it
into
a
new
understanding
of
the
topic
I
am
writing
about,
doing
so
more
on
paper
(or
on
a
computer)
and
less
mentally,
and
then
allowing
the
outline
of
the
paper
to
flow
from
this
outlined
statement
of
my
understanding.
In
a
certain
sense,
being
able
to
use
the
external
aid
of
writing
down
ideas
has
allowed
me
to
consider
more
complex
ideas,
by
virtue
of
not
being
obligated
to
remember
all
their
details
at
once.
My
experience
with
writing
and
research
media
has
been
similar
in
nature.
I
have
increasingly
used
a
greater
variety
of
sources,
and
have
more
and
more
often
used
computers
in
various
ways
to
help
me
organize
data
and
information,
allowing
me
to
spend
more
mental
energy
writing
or
organizing,
and
spend
less
of
it
in
remembering.
In
this
way,
I
hope
to
be
able
to
focus
more
on
choosing
methods
and
sources
which
better
inform
the
papers
I
am
writing,
and
thus
produce
papers
which
are
both
more
complex,
and
clearer
in
