Literary
Narrative
Though
I
could
not
initially
recall
my
first
experiences
with
writing,
I
was
quickly
apprised
of
them
by
my
mother,
who,
like
any
parent
trying
to
be
the
custodian
of
those
vague
childhood
memories,
had
ferreted
away
my
old
journals
for
my
present-day
perusal.
The
journals,
which
were
written
in
1996,
or
the
spring
of
first
grade,
are
jotted
in
an
uncertain
hand,
and
the
basic
entries
are
accompanied
by
similarly
rudimentary
illustrations
of
that
which
is
described.
The
journal
entries
are
rather
shortNonly
two
to
three
lines
in
length,
with
the
occasional
longer
entryNand
filled
with
errors
orthographical,
grammatical,
and
syntactical:
the
word
NcousinsO
becomes
misspelled
NcousonsO,
while
NareO
is
confused
with
NourO,
and
the
homonyms
NthereOsO
and
NtheirsO
are
interchanged
freely.
Having
had
my
memory
whetted
by
reading
through
the
two
journals,
I
only
vaguely
recall
writing
those
entries;
what
I
do
remember
with
much
greater
detail,
however,
is
drawing
the
accompanying
pictures.
Despite
what
the
simple
drawings
say
about
my
early
abilities
as
an
artist,
I
remember
being
much
more
drawn
(no
pun
intended)
to
the
artistic
side
of
the
journal
entries
than
to
writing
about
the
quotidian
aspects
of
my
childhood:
watching
cartoons,
playing
football
with
friends,
or
playing
video
games
until
my
thumbs
had
become
swollen
with
blisters.
Writing
was
simply
an
act
that
the
teacher
instructed
us
to
perform
before
arriving
at
the
good
partNillustrating
the
entries.
It
was
not
until
a
bit
later
in
life
that
I
began
to
enjoy
writing
in
and
of
itself.
The
first
time
I
distinctly
remember
enjoying
writing
came
in
fourth
grade,
when
we
were
assigned
a
project
for
the
upcoming
VeteranOs
Day.
We
were
to
write
to
a
veteran
asking
them
about
their
experiences
in
whichever
war
they
took
part.
By
composing
a
simple
letter
to
my
great
uncle
John,
I
was
able
to
hear
about
his
experiences
as
a
crewman
aboard
a
B-52
bomber
plane
during
World
War
II
and
the
ensuing
stay
in
a
prisoner-of-war
camp
when
the
aircraft
was
downed
over
Bulgaria.
Though
the
missive
itself
was
rather
informal
and
posed
a
few
basic
questions,
its
composition
marked
the
first
time
that
I
was
excited
about
writing
and
its
possibilities.
It
was
in
fourth
grade
that
I
also
began
to
discover
the
more
artistic
side
of
writing
in
poetry.
The
first
of
the
poems
I
wrote
was
a
poem
about
professional
golfer
Tiger
Woods,
and
admittedly,
my
father
helped
me
quite
a
bit
in
writing
it.
The
second
poem,
titled
NTrees
ArenOt
AllergiesO
and
written
without
the
succor
of
my
father,
was
a
reflection
of
my
fundamental
grasp
of
poetry,
with
its
sing-song
rhymes
and
simple
AABB
rhyme
scheme:
NAll
my
friends
think
itOs
funny
/
When
my
nose
gets
red
and
runny
/
Cough,
wheeze,
sniffle,
and
sneeze
/
Could
it
all
be
because
of
trees?...O
My
poem
won
the
school-wide
contest
for
the
celebration
of
Earth
Day,
and
I
remember
feeling
proud
for
this
small
accomplishment.
After
the
composition
of
these
two
poems,
it
was
not
until
high
school
that
I
would
again
explore
the
creative
side
of
writing.
At
about
the
same
time
that
I
was
being
introduced
to
the
less
rigid
styles
of
writing,
I
was
also
being
introduced
to
the
more
formal
research
paper.
Each
of
us
was
assigned
an
endangered
species
on
which
to
report,
and
I
received
the
bald
eagle.
My
research
paper,
only
a
scanty
single-spaced
page
in
length,
was
straightforward
and
seemed
more
like
a
litany
of
facts
thrown
together
with
all
the
style
ofNwellNa
fourth-grade
writer.
Additionally,
to
the
end
of
the
paper
was
appended
a
most
basic
works
cited
page,
containing
simply
the
names
and
page
numbers
of
the
books
and
encyclopedias
I
used.
The
works
cited
page
was
in
no
certain
formatNMLA,
APA,
or
otherwiseNand
the
paper
itself
included
no
citations,
though
it
did
mark
the
first
time
I
was
introduced
to
more
formal
writing.
Beginning
in
fifth
grade,
I
developed
an
infatuation
with
words
that
was
engendered
by
the
annual
middle
school
spelling
bee.
My
friend
Sean
and
I
summarily
became
obsessed
with
not
only
the
orthography
of
words,
but
their
meanings,
too,
and
we
both
endeavored
to
read
the
dictionary
from
cover
to
cover.
Together,
we
scanned
the
pages
of
the
lexicon,
keeping
notebooks
filled
with
the
definitions
of
words
that
interested
us.
Though
my
prepossession
with
words
did
not
have
an
immediate,
substantial
impact
on
my
writing,
it
continued
to
burgeon
throughout
sixth,
seventh,
and
eighth
grade
and
even
high
school.
In
middle
school,
I
tended
to
exhibit
my
precocious
vocabulary,
oftentimes
opting
to
use
large
words,
sometimes
incorrectly
and
in
the
wrong
context;
in
high
school,
however,
I
began
to
implement
these
words
into
my
writing
style
more
effectively,
using
them
to
add
a
sense
of
sophistication
and
fullness
to
my
compositions.
The
point
of
having
an
expansive
vocabulary
was
no
longer
to
sound
as
intelligent
as
impossible
(and
instead
end
up
sounding
pretentious
and
highfalutin),
but
to
find
the
perfect
word
or
turn
of
phrase
to
capture
the
exact
feeling
or
implication
that
I
was
trying
to
convey.
My
sense
of
grammar
and
my
knowledge
of
different
writing
styles
were
augmented
by
a
particularly
excellent
English
teacher
in
seventh
and
eighth
grades.
His
approach
to
grammar
was
simple
and
systematic:
each
day
for
about
a
week
and
a
half,
we
took
notes
on
hundreds
of
entries
in
a
book
called
WriterOs,
Inc.
on
everything
from
sentence
type
and
sentence
structure
to
semi-colon
and
ellipse
usage.
Although
this
method
proved
rather
monotonous,
I
and
each
of
my
classmates
quickly
became
experts
in
the
realm
of
syntax
and
grammar,
improving
our
writing
immensely.
In
addition
to
learning
grammar,
we
also
learned
extensively
about
literary
devices,
including
conceit,
figures
of
speech,
meter,
rhyme
scheme,
et
cetera,
and
our
newfound
familiarity
with
them
played
directly
into
the
curriculum
my
teacher
had
planned.
It
was
in
seventh
grade
that
I
first
learned
to
analyze
poetry,
starting
with
William
BlakeOs
NThe
TygerO.
Though
my
teacher
commented
that
my
analysis
was
one
of
the
best
in
the
class,
in
hindsight,
I
realize
that
my
examination
of
the
poem
tended
to
be
superficial
at
times.
While
I
did
make
some
cogent
points
on
the
poemOs
interpretation
and
examined
the
various
religious
allusions
to
God,
Jesus,
and
Satan,
other
parts
of
my
analysis
were
somewhat
lacking.
For
example,
I
examined
the
rhyme
scheme,
noting
that
it
followed
a
simple
AABB
pattern,
but
failed
to
comment
on
its
effect
on
the
poem.
Seventh
grade
marked
a
paradigmatic
shift
in
my
grasp
of
writing,
though
it
still
lacked
the
maturity
that
would
come
in
my
high
school
years.
The
next
year,
under
the
aegis
of
the
very
same
English
teacher,
I
was
further
introduced
to
formal
writing,
including
a
proper
research
paper
and
a
formal
business
letter.
My
research
paper,
which
focused
on
the
development
of
slang
and
colloquial
language
in
the
English
language
(particularly
in
America),
drew
from
a
wide
variety
of
sources,
including
books,
encyclopedias,
journals,
and
web
sites.
Unlike
my
attempt
at
a
research
paper
in
fourth
grade,
this
paper
actually
did
cite
the
myriad
sources
and
included
a
formal
works
cited
page
in
accordance
with
MLA
standards.
Meanwhile,
I
also
learned
about
the
business
letter,
which
I
wrote
to
one
of
my
favorite
bands
at
the
time.
I
learned
of
all
the
formal
letterOs
nuances,
from
the
format
of
the
senderOs
address
and
inside
address
to
the
spacing
of
the
body
and
signature
block,
thus
adding
one
further
genre
of
writing
to
my
repertoire.
My
seventh
and
eighth
grade
English
teacher
instilled
in
me
a
liking
for
writing
that
would
blossom
into
a
love
in
high
school.
Some
might
think
that
having
the
same
English
teacher
for
three
years
of
oneOs
high
school
tenure
would
prove
to
be
a
stultifying
experience,
but
then
again,
some
have
not
met
the
likes
of
Mr.
Paul
OOConnor.
My
English
teacher
for
my
freshman,
junior,
and
senior
years
of
high
school,
Mr.
OOConnor
shared
with
us
his
love
for
writing
and
his
immense
body
of
knowledge
on
the
subject.
Although
by
the
time
I
reached
high
school,
exploring
the
different
genres
of
writing
was
a
recapitulation
of
my
earlier
education,
Mr.
OOConnor
greatly
enhanced
my
conception
of
literary
analysis
of
both
prose
and
verse.
As
part
of
our
education
in
stylistic
analysis
of
poetry,
we
were
each
assigned
two
poems
from
a
collection
called
Moy
Sand
and
Gravel
by
Paul
Muldoon
and
given
a
sampleNwritten
by
Mr.
OOConnor
himself,
analyzing
the
first
poem
of
the
collectionNof
what
was
expected
of
us.
He
handed
to
us
a
most
insightful
two-page,
single
spaced
paper
in
size-ten
font
that
read
so
brilliantly
and
fluidly
that
it
could
have
easily
been
produced
by
someone
whose
livelihood
was
literary
criticism.
Even
if
my
literary
analyses
of
those
first
poems
paled
in
comparison
to
that
of
my
English
teacher,
I
saw
a
marked
improvement
in
my
writing
style
throughout
freshman
year
as
I
aspired
to
be
capable
of
writing
like
Mr.
OOConnor.
In
my
junior
and
senior
years,
the
focus
of
writing
shifted
more
towards
prose
analysis
and
research
papers.
Mr.
OOConnor
was
keen
on
analyzing
character
development,
symbolism,
and
themes
in
novels
such
as
The
Odyssey,
Don
Quixote,
The
Rainbow
and
Crime
and
Punishment
and
various
literary
passages.
I
wrote
some
of
my
best
papers
on
these
novels
and
excerpts,
and
my
teacher
tended
to
agree:
on
one
occasion,
he
thought
that
I
had
written
such
powerful
a
powerful
introduction
and
conclusion
to
my
paper
that
he
had
me
read
it
aloud
to
the
entire
class.
Admittedly,
I
was
proud
to
garner
the
praise
of
someone
I
admired
as
a
writer,
and
it
was
not
the
last
time
that
I
was
to
receive
similar
approbation.
Wanting
us
to
be
responsible
and
informed
global
citizens,
my
English
teacher
also
had
us
write
research
papers
on
the
emergence
and
globalization
of
China
and
India,
global
warming,
and
the
war
in
Iraq.
My
paper
on
global
warming,
in
which
I
sorted
through
potential
theories
and
supporting
evidence
that
affirmed
or
refuted
the
phenomenon
and
subsequently
posited
possible
solutions
for
what
I
believed
was
a
legitimate
concern,
was
so
well
received
by
my
teacher
that
he
published
my
work
in
the
seasonal
literary
magazine.
Mr.
OOConnor
had
taken
such
a
liking
to
my
writing
that
he
paid
me
the
ultimate
compliment:
as
the
overseer
of
the
yearbook
production,
he
commissioned
me
to
write
a
page-length
salutation
for
the
yearbook
in
which
I
described
the
transformations
of
the
entire
class
from
bright-eyed
freshmen
into
a
single
cohesive
body
of
young
men
that
won
state
titles
and
theater
awards,
garnered
national
recognition
academically
and
athletically,
and
generally
attained
new
heights
that
had
not
had
been
reached
by
our
predecessors.
At
around
the
same
point
in
my
high
school
career,
I
began
to
experiment
more
extensively
with
artistic
forms
of
writing,
such
as
poetry
and
lyrics.
Having
been
inspired
by
reading
the
likes
of
Dickinson,
Whittier,
Donne,
and
others,
I
began
writing
poetry.
Initially,
my
attempts
at
verse
were
a
bit
stifled,
as
I
tried
too
hard
to
sound
overly
formal
and
stay
within
the
confines
of
a
set
rhyme
scheme;
however,
I
eventually
found
my
voice
and
rhythm
in
the
more
organic
approach
of
free
verse
and
was
able
to
produce
satisfactory
efforts.
Since
I
do
play
guitar
and
enjoy
writing
my
own
music,
I
appropriated
my
verse
writing
abilities
for
composing
song
lyrics.
In
an
even
less
formal
style
and
in
plainer
speech
than
I
had
written
my
poems,
I
began
writing
lyrics
as
a
catharsis
of
all
my
thoughts,
feelings,
emotions,
problems,
and
experiences.
Writing
was
at
once
challenging
and
pleasurable,
as
I
sometimes
struggled
to
describe
those
feelings
that
defy
classification
and
can
scarcely
be
put
into
words.
I
continue
to
write
poetry
and
lyrics
as
a
means
of
mitigating
stress
and
for
the
pure
thrill
of
artistic
creation.
Being
a
chemistry
major
eager
to
get
quite
a
few
of
my
requirements
out
of
the
way,
I
only
took
one
writing
class
my
freshman
year
at
Lafayette
College.
I
felt
confident
in
my
abilities
to
write
at
a
college
level
due
to
the
many
excellent
years
of
English
class
I
had
in
middle
school
and
high
school.
Though
my
professor
appreciated
my
writing
immenselyNhe
commented
that
I
was
the
Nbest
writer
in
the
classO
and
asked
me
where
I
learned
to
write
like
I
doNthere
seemed
to
be
some
sort
of
misinterpretation
on
my
part
of
what
he
was
looking
for
in
a
reflection
paper.
He
had
mentioned
that
he
wanted
our
thoughts
and
feelings
on
a
book
we
had
read,
though
I
saw
the
task
as
a
bit
difficult,
considering
the
formal,
third-person
perspective
in
which
the
paper
was
to
be
written.
I
managed
to
interpolate
my
own
(Nthe
readerOsO)
feelings,
but
he
still
commented
that
my
paper
read
too
much
like
a
book
review.
Although
I
was
not
terribly
upset
by
my
grade,
I
was
still
a
bit
confused
by
the
professorOs
rather
vague
instructions.
My
first
year
seminar
proved
to
be
a
learning
experience
in
the
expectations
of
professors,
and
it
is
my
hope
that
in
the
future,
my
proficiency
in
writing
and
my
newfound
knowledge
will
help
me
to
achieve
a
lofty
4.0
GPA.
