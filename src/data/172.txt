I
walked
into
the
Mario
Room
for
my
writer's
workshop
last
August
with
a
pencil
and
notebook
in
hand.
Suddenly,
I
was
surrounded
by
fellow
writers
eager
to
learn
more
about
the
Comprehensive
Writing
Program.
I
personally
anticipated
the
magical
transformation
from
a
typical
Lafayette
College
student
to
a
...
WA!
I
plopped
down
in
the
nearest
seat
expecting
that
I
would
sit
and
listen
for
the
next
few
hours
to
the
step-by-step
process
to
becoming
a
Writing
Associate.
Needless
to
say,
I
left
that
workshop
with
a
blank
piece
of
paper
realizing
that
I
couldn't
learn
how
to
be
a
WA
overnight.
In
fact,
it
was
my
interactions
with
students
during
conferences
and
a
difficult
class
that
I
took
during
the
fall
semester
that
helped
me
understand
my
role
as
a
Writing
Associate.
I
realized
that
one
workshop
couldn't
teach
me
everything
I
needed
to
know
about
being
a
WA.
It
was
a
combination
of
many
different
experiences
that
helped
me
perform
to
the
best
of
my
ability
as
a
Writing
Associate.
My
confidence
and
satisfaction
with
this
position
have
made
any
doubts
I
once
had
about
being
a
WA
disappear.
Now,
I
look
forward
to
the
start
of
a
new
semester
because,
unlike
many
other
students,
I
will
have
a
challenging
opportunity
to
help
my
peers
express
their
thoughts
and
opinions
through
their
writing.
It
was
during
the
fourth
grade
that
I
first
developed
a
love
for
writing.
At
the
end
of
each
section
in
our
spelling
books
there
were
instructions
for
students
to
write
a
paragraph
based
on
a
scenario
provided
by
the
book.
Each
assignment
was
followed
by
the
groans
and
ubiquitous
complaints
of
the
students,
although
I
alone
remained
silent,
upset
that
the
spelling
book
asked
us
to
write
only
one
paragraph.
I
eagerly
anticipated
the
end
of
each
chapter,
anxious
to
create
new
melodrama.
While
my
classmates
handed
in
single
sheets
of
loose-leaf
paper
with
practically
nothing
but
a
mere
splatter
of
ink
on
them,
I
submitted
several
sheets
stapled
together
introducing
a
multitude
of
characters
and
creating
make
believe
places
where
problem
after
problem
arose,
creating
the
need
to
continue
writing.
Mrs.
Andrews,
the
elderly
teacher
who
assigned
the
writing
assignments
soon
noticed
my
passion
for
writing.
She
encouraged
me
to
write
as
much
as
I
could,
until
my
hand
hurt
and
I
felt
that
I
could
write
no
longer.
I
remember
leaving
fourth
grade
on
the
last
day
of
school
with
a
thick
green,
bulging
folder
on
which
I
had
written
in
my
most
perfect
handwriting
My
Stories."
That
folder
is
now
at
the
bottom
of
a
file
of
folders
which
contains
other
written
pieces
of
work
that
I
have
accumulated
over
the
years.
During
middle
and
high
school,
and
now
even
in
college,
I
have
used
writing
as
a
form
of
expression.
It
is
one
of
the
easier
ways
for
me
to
express
my
emotions
when
mere
speech
is
not
enough.
Once
I
begin
writing,
I
find
it
hard
to
stop.
In
my
closet
at
home,
there
is
a
huge
bag
containing
all
of
the
journals
I
have
ever
kept
over
the
years,
beginning
with
the
sixth
grade.
Now
that
I
am
older,
I
find
it
more
difficult
to
find
the
time
to
write
about
how
I
am
feeling.
Lately,
I
haven't
been
writing
in
my
journal
as
much
as
I
would
like
to,
although
the
number
of
pages
I
have
written
describing
my
thoughts,
fears,
hopes
and
dreams
over
the
years
is
unbelievable.
At
times
during
high
school,
while
mastering
the
art
of
procrastination,
I
would
go
digging
for
these
journals
rather
than
study
for
my
chemistry
exams.
I
have
spent
countless
hours
rereading
entries
I
have
made
throughout
my
adolescent
years,
noticing
the
changes
in
both
my
emotional
state
and
writing
style
as
well.
Each
of
my
journals
has
a
different
pattern,
making
it
easier
to
tell
one
apart
from
another.
The
first
few
pages
of
every
journal,
each
written
neatly,
all
resemble
one
another,
while
the
pages
that
follow
consist
of
messy
print,
each
written
furiously
in
an
effort
to
record
every
thought
and
emotion.
In
a
way
these
journals
are
a
window
to
my
past,
a
way
to
help
me
remember
what
it
was
like
to
be
young,
when
everything
was
so
fresh,
new,
exciting,
and
frightening
as
well.
They
are
the
encyclopedias
of
my
life
which
I
look
to
as
reminders
of
my
memorable
past.
Some
of
my
best
experiences
as
a
writer
occurred
while
I
was
in
high
school.
In
an
honors
English
class,
I
was
required
to
write
a
research
paper
using
literary
criticisms.
Uneducated
on
how
to
write
a
paper
using
sources
such
as
these,
I
worried
that
I
wouldn't
be
able
to
do
it.
I
worried
that
I
wouldn't
know
how
to
analyze
and
integrate
outside
sources
into
my
paper.
I
worried
that
I
would
fail
at
writing.
In
this
particular
case,
my
paranoia
had
a
positive
effect
on
my
writing
because
it
increased
my
determination
to
work
diligently
in
order
to
produce
a
fabulous
paper.
After
much
deliberation,
I
chose
to
write
about
Holden
Caulfield's
quest
to
preserve
innocence
in
The
Catcher
in
the
Rye.
I
will
never
forget
the
satisfaction
I
felt
as
I
flipped
through
ten
crisp
white,
perfectly
typed
pages
that
I
at
first
had
no
idea
how
to
write.
When
I
started,
I
feared
not
having
enough
to
say
and
by
this
point
I
had
needed
to
do
some
serious
editing
in
order
to
keep
from
writing
too
much.
My
success
on
this
research
paper
only
increased
my
fascination
with
the
writing
process.
At
first
I
was
apprehensive
about
approaching
an
unfamiliar
style
of
writing
however,
once
I
chose
a
topic
that
intrigued
me,
I
was
able
to
combine
my
insight
with
the
ideas
of
others
to
produce
a
paper
that
I
am
proud
to
call
my
own
today.
During
this
past
year,
the
professor
in
my
Political
Theory
class
exposed
me
to
another
style
of
writing
that
I
once
considered
impossible
to
imitate.
I
enrolled
in
the
class
because
two
of
my
friends
highly
recommended
it.
They
warned
me
that
the
class
was
extremely
difficult
but
when
I
saw
that
the
syllabus
mentioned
only
three
papers
and
no
exams,
all
of
my
fears
dissipated.
To
my
surprise,
Political
Theory
was
the
class
that
challenged
my
writing
more
than
any
other
class
thus
far
in
my
college
career.
Although
this
class
was
my
most
challenging,
it
was
also
one
of
my
favorites.
I
can
recall
the
countless
nights
and
hours
spent
brainstorming
ideas
to
use
in
my
papers.
Unlike
other
research
papers
I
had
written,
Political
Theory
was
less
mechanical.
It
required
me
to
pose
a
theoretical
question
and
to
use
my
paper
to
argue
all
of
the
different
aspects
of
a
specific
theory.
For
this
reason,
Political
Theory
forced
me
to
constantly
be
thinking
both
inside
and
outside
of
the
classroom
while
emphasizing
the
significance
of
strong
writing
skills.
Through
theoretical
papers,
I
could
take
ideas
that
arose
in
classroom
discussions
and
bring
them
to
a
higher
level
through
writing.
This
style
of
writing
seemed
extremely
difficult
at
first,
especially
because
I
wasn't
accustomed
to
expressing
myself
this
way.
It
was
a
combination
of
my
perseverance
and
conferences
with
my
own
WA
for
Political
Theory
that
resulted
in
my
success
in
the
class.
Considering
that
I
was
a
WA,
having
to
meet
with
another
WA
seemed
bizarre
at
first.
However,
it
was
through
my
interactions
with
a
fellow
colleague
that
helped
me
to
realize
the
effectiveness
of
the
Writing
Associate
Program.
Lisa,
my
WA,
helped
me
to
understand
the
purpose
of
a
theoretical
paper
and
she
honestly
critiqued
my
work
in
an
effort
to
help
me
improve
my
own
writing.
She
was
able
to
use
her
own
experiences
from
the
class
the
previous
semester
to
assist
me
in
adapting
my
writing
style
to
the
type
that
was
needed
for
a
theoretical
paper.
Without
her
assistance,
I
can
honestly
say
that
Political
Theory
papers
might
have
left
me
utterly
confused
and
discouraged.
In
addition
to
Political
Theory,
my
own
experience
as
a
WA
played
a
major
role
in
the
emergence
of
my
identity
as
a
writer.
Working
as
a
WA
helped
me
to
read
papers
written
by
fellow
students,
allowing
me
to
see
how
others
approached
the
writing
process.
As
a
result,
I
was
introduced
to
new
techniques
that
I
believed
worked
well
and
I
was
also
better
trained
to
recognize
those
that
did
not.
After
my
first
round
of
conferences,
I
noticed
myself
becoming
even
more
serious
about
my
writing
and
taking
the
advice
that
I
had
given
to
other
students
in
our
conferences.
I
noticed
many
difficulties
that
these
students
encountered
were
similar
to
the
problems
I
had
experienced
during
my
first
year
of
college.
It
wasn't
always
easy
to
help
everyone
since
each
student
was
different.
At
times
I
encountered
students
who
didn't
want
to
put
in
any
more
effort
than
they
needed
to
while
others
wanted
to
meet
with
me
five
times
if
possible.
In
many
instances,
I
could
recognize
certain
strong
points
in
the
papers
that
I
read
in
addition
to
the
obvious
weaker
aspects
as
well.
In
a
sense,
I
forged
a
bond
with
many
of
the
students
and
it
was
extremely
rewarding
to
see
their
writing
improve
with
each
conference.
The
fact
that
each
conference
was
so
unpredictable,
based
on
each
student's
individuality,
made
me
realize
that
a
set
of
rules
on
how
to
be
the
perfect
WA
was
not
necessary
in
order
for
me
to
fulfill
my
role
to
the
best
of
my
ability.
When
I
was
first
hired
as
a
WA,
I
already
had
many
of
the
tools
that
would
be
needed
to
perform
my
job.
One
necessary
requirement
was
learning
how
to
use
each
of
those
tools,
specifically
my
listening
and
communication
skills,
in
order
to
be
the
best
WA
that
I
possibly
could.
I
am
extremely
excited
to
continue
working
as
a
WA
this
semester.
As
I
have
seen
my
writing
skills
improve
with
practice,
I
intend
to
continue
to
improve
my
performance
as
a
WA
and
I
eagerly
anticipate
working
with
new
students
and
new
professors
and
being
exposed
to
their
fresh
ideas
and
writing
styles.
I
realize
that
my
writing
is
not
perfect
and
that
I
too
can
learn
from
my
peers.
I
believe
that
all
WA's
must
realize
that
as
students,
we
may
experience
many
of
the
same
difficulties
and
challenges
of
writing.
The
main
difference
is
that
it
is
our
job
to
help
students
recognize
both
their
strengths
and
weaknesses
while
striving
to
improve
their
overall
writing
performance.
