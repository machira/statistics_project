Until
I
received
this
assignment
I
never
thought
about
my
history
as
a
writer
or
my
introduction
to
writing.
My
relationship
with
writing
reflects
my
personal
growth.
Free
writing
in
my
journal
allows
me
to
explain
my
life
in
ways
I
had
never
thought
possible.
At
first,
my
entries
were
based
on
day-to-day
events
and
basic
emotions.
With
the
start
of
middle
school
I
gained
a
greater
appreciation
for
literature
and
poetry.
My
writing
transitioned
into
a
dialogue
between
the
page
and
I,
in
which
I
constantly
invent
new
methods
of
expression.
The
evolution
that
I
underwent
with
writing
also
relates
to
the
exposure
IOve
had
to
a
variety
of
authors.
As
a
young
writer
I
thought
of
writing
as
a
requirement.
With
time,
I
recognized
that
writing
could
be
art,
which
is
seen
in
literature,
poetry,
music,
and
theater.
Furthermore,
by
developing
into
an
Nacademic
writer,O
I
learned
that
a
writer
does
more
than
put
words
down
on
paper.
Each
writer
attains
a
sense
of
responsibility
for
his
or
her
words.
My
history
as
a
writer
is
really
the
story
of
how
my
perception
of
writing
altered
from
a
requirement
to
an
affinity
to
a
passion.
Throughout
elementary
school
my
notions
about
writing
were
confined
to
the
realm
of
book
reports
and
essays.
None
of
these
assignments
excited
me
because
writing
was
a
requirement
that
needed
to
be
turned
in
and
graded.
My
first
memory
of
being
eager
to
write
was
when
I
was
in
first
grade.
My
parents
bought
me
a
white
diary
with
gold
trim
for
Christmas.
One
of
the
reasons
that
my
parents
gave
me
a
diary
was
because
they
thought,
Nevery
little
girl
should
have
one.O
I
think
this
went
along
with
the
ballet
lessons
and
pink
curtains
in
my
roomNan
attempt
to
make
their
tomboy
a
little
more
feminine.
Even
though
these
efforts
didnOt
stop
me
from
playing
in
the
dirt,
my
parents
did
start
the
ball
rolling
with
my
free
writing.
The
best
part
about
the
diary
was
that
it
had
a
lock.
I
was
thrilled
that
I
could
record
anything
I
wanted
to
with
the
confidence
that
no
one
would
see
my
opinions
and
confessions.
At
the
time,
this
sort
of
writing
was
attractive
because
of
its
secretive
nature.
Using
the
diary
was
a
way
for
me
to
be
by
myself,
without
anyone
else
telling
me
how
to
write
or
what
to
think.
I
only
dabbled
at
free
writing,
picking
up
the
diary
every
now
and
then
to
note
things
about
my
friends,
family,
and
school
events.
Discovering
poetry
in
middle
school
disrupted
my
childhood
ideas
about
writing.
Immediately,
I
felt
a
connection
with
words
that
I
never
experienced
before.
Instead
of
writing
school
reports,
I
discovered
that
writing
could
be
a
means
of
enjoyment
and
art.
Most
importantly,
I
was
encouraged
to
write
my
own
poetry
by
my
English
teacher
who
suggested
I
write
on
my
own
and
research
some
famous
poets.
For
the
first
time
some
one
was
recognizing
my
writing
as
worthwhile.
I
was
enthusiastic
at
the
support
I
received.
I
eagerly
went
to
the
library
to
see
what
I
could
find
out
about
what
poetry.
I
quickly
came
to
the
realization
that
not
all
poetry
was:
NRoses
are
red,
violets
are
blue.O
In
fact,
that
Hallmark
card
poetry
was
the
minority
in
a
conglomeration
of
amazing
poets
that
were
going
against
tradition.
For
instance,
even
though
I
encountered
e.e.cummings
more
than
five
years
ago
in
my
middle
schoolOs
library,
I
continue
to
be
wide-eyed
and
curious
at
his
unique
writing
style.
I
also
remain
interested
in
creativity
of
Rumi,
Rainer
Maria
Rilke,
and
William
Carlos
Williams
to
name
a
few.
While
I
was
just
scratching
the
surface
of
what
poetry
could
offer,
my
8th
grade
English
teacher
persuaded
me
to
enter
a
contest
for
young
poets.
I
wrote
my
first
real
poem
for
the
competition
entitled,
NDreams.O
Although
it
is
only
about
20
lines
long,
with
simplistic
imagery,
I
consider
this
a
milestone
in
my
history
as
a
writer.
I
received
Honorable
Mention
and
got
my
poem
published
in
The
New
Jersey
Young
Poets
Anthology.
Again,
the
recognition
of
value
in
my
writing
sent
me
soaring.
Winning
this
minor
award
gave
me
the
confidence
needed
to
continue
writing.
If
I
had
not
encountered
such
support
for
my
writing
I
probably
would
not
have
ended
up
being
the
avid
writer
I
am.
By
the
time
I
entered
high
school
I
was
actively
pursuing
ideas
and
poems
in
a
brown
leather
journal
I
bought.
Gradually,
writing
took
two
new
magnitudes,
one
as
an
art
form,
and
the
other
as
an
outlet
for
my
emotions.
Instead
of
holding
back
fear,
frustration,
or
happiness,
I
attempted
to
describe
my
feelings
in
pages
of
writing.
No
longer
did
I
need
a
confidence
boost
to
urge
me
on,
although
IOm
still
pleased
when
someone
tells
me
that
they
enjoy
my
writing.
While
this
journal
did
not
have
a
gold
lock
like
my
previous
diary,
I
was
still
partially
secretive
about
my
writing.
The
first
reason
for
this
was
because
I
feared
that
my
writing
had
not
reached
the
level
of
merit
it
should
have,
in
my
mind,
to
even
share
with
my
closest
confidants.
Secondly,
I
believed
that
no
one
would
understand
my
relationship
with
words,
and
how
significant
my
own
creation
had
become.
At
that
point,
my
peers
still
saw
writing
as
a
required,
boring
task.
Therefore,
to
avoid
being
seen
as
strange
or
being
misunderstood,
I
only
showed
my
magnetism
towards
writing
to
my
teachers.
I
remember
feeling
restricted
to
those
lined
pages,
as
if
there
must
be
other
ways
that
writing
could
lead
me.
Responsibility
as
a
reader
and
writer
was
the
greatest
aspect
of
writing
that
I
learned
in
high
school.
No
longer
could
I
write
without
considering
the
evidence
to
back
up
my
arguments
or
the
sources
I
used.
Active
participation
was
anticipated
to
fuel
class
discussions.
My
AP
English
teacher
read
a
personal
essay
that
one
student
had
written
aloud
to
the
class.
After
he
stopped
reading
the
teacher
asked
if
there
were
any
Npraises
or
criticisms
for
the
writerO.
Silence
was
the
only
response
he
received.
Part
of
the
lack
of
responses
might
have
been
because
of
the
highly
intimate
nature
of
the
piece,
or
the
fact
that
the
author
was
sitting
in
the
room.
The
tension
grew
with
every
second
of
chair
creaking,
coughing,
and
shifting
bodies.
Still
no
one
commented
on
what
had
been
read.
Suddenly,
the
teacher
stood
up
and
exclaimed
in
frustration
that
this
was
an
AP
English
course,
not
some
class
for
slackers.
NIf
you
canOt
make
an
kind
of
educated
response
about
what
one
of
your
own
classmates
have
written,O
he
said,
Nthen
I
will
not
waste
my
time
in
this
classO
and
left
the
room.
That
incident
made
it
clear
to
me
that
silence
means
nothing.
Dialogue,
no
matter
how
convoluted,
is
worthwhile
in
understanding
a
text.
Discussions
about
some
of
my
favorite
authors
have
given
my
own
writing
different
dimensions.
Exposure
to
writers
such
as,
Emily
Dickinson,
George
Orwell,
Milan
Kundera,
Bob
Dylan,
and
James
Joyce,
showed
me
that
just
as
there
was
not
only
one
way
to
write,
there
was
also
a
multitude
of
ways
to
interpret
text.
During
my
junior
year
I
was
introduced
to
performance
art,
specifically
slam
poetry.
By
definition
a
slam
is
a
competition
where
poets
perform
their
poetry,
hoping
to
get
the
highest
score
so
they
can
advance
to
the
final
round
and
win.
My
first
taste
of
slam
poetry
was
through
my
English
teacher,
who
played
a
clip
from
the
movie,
NSlam.O
The
movie
starred
Saul
Williams,
a
real-life
slam
poet,
who
plays
a
man
that
escapes
a
life
of
drugs
and
crime
through
poetry.
The
part
of
the
movie
that
was
the
most
potent
was
when
Williams
slams
publicly
for
the
first
time.
I
was
exhilarated
by
the
flow
of
each
line,
and
became
conscious
of
the
power
in
not
only
hearing
the
poetOs
words,
but
also
seeing
them
resonate
in
a
performance.
The
unity
of
visual
and
audio
sensations
made
the
poetry
completely
different
from
any
other
form
of
writing.
I
knew
that
slam
poetry
was
the
link
I
had
been
missing.
If
I
truly
wanted
to
make
an
impact
with
my
writing,
I
needed
to
perform
it
myselfNwith
my
voice
and
body
conveying
each
of
my
words.
I
started
writing
my
own
slam
poetry
in
high
school,
but
rarely
performed
any
of
it.
My
friends
and
I
found
out
about
a
hip
little
caf
in
Trenton
called
Urban
Word
that
did
poetry
slams
every
Tuesday
night.
Initially
we
went
as
only
listeners;
however,
eventually
I
mustered
up
the
courage
to
slam
at
Urban
Word,
leaving
round
one
with
a
24.55
out
of
30.
Even
though
I
didnOt
advance
to
the
next
round,
I
listened
to
the
rest
of
the
poets
with
self-satisfaction
because
I
was
no
longer
only
a
listener,
I
was
a
performer.
Graduating
high
school
left
me
confident
in
my
writing
ability
because
of
the
rigorous
writing
I
had
done
in
all
my
courses,
as
well
as
my
own
free
writing.
Despite
this
confidence,
I
was
still
unsure
as
to
what
would
be
expected
of
me
as
a
college
writer.
I
knew
that
Lafayette
had
a
commitment
to
creating
strong
writers
across
the
curriculum.
Yet,
in
high
school
my
teachers
were
very
supportive
and
always
offering
extra
help
where
it
was
needed.
When
I
got
the
opportunity
to
do
some
free
writing
in
class,
I
was
told
that
my
writing
was
insightful
and
sincere.
How
would
college
professors
comment?
I
was
introduced
to
college
writing
in
my
First
Year
Seminar.
My
teacher
was
encouraging
and
supportive
like
my
high
school
mentors;
however,
he
was
also
more
stern
and
critical.
I
learned
that
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
write
differently
when
it
came
to
doing
a
research
paper
verses
writing
a
slam.
Embellishing
with
metaphors
and
adjectives
galore
in
my
writing
got
me
nowhere.
My
FYS
professor
taught
me
to
be
purposeful
in
my
writing,
which
meant
using
concise,
informative
sentences.
On
my
first
research
paper
for
his
class
I
received
a
D-.
At
the
start,
I
was
frustrated
and
worried
that
I
would
never
be
able
to
write
for
a
college
course.
Luckily,
it
was
only
the
first
draft,
and
with
numerous
revisions
I
finally
earned
an
A.
Being
an
Nacademic
writerO
in
college
is
more
demanding
and
rewarding
for
me
than
writing
in
high
school.
My
ideas
and
writing
style
are
questioned,
not
simply
accepted,
thereby
constantly
challenging
me
as
a
writer.
Free
writing
in
college
was
more
difficult
than
I
thought
it
would
be.
At
first
I
didnOt
have
time
to
write
everyday
like
I
had
been
doing
in
the
past.
More
importantly,
I
did
not
have
the
same
sort
of
encouragement
that
I
had
in
high
school.
When
I
was
home,
all
my
friends
knew
I
was
writing
and
would
be
eager
to
listen
if
I
wanted
to
share
my
work.
Yet,
when
I
went
to
school
I
felt
isolated,
like
no
one
really
cared
about
my
art.
As
the
year
continued
I
found
various
ways
to
continue
my
free
writing
with
the
help
of
friends
I
made
at
school
and
certain
professors.
At
the
end
of
the
semester
a
writing
circle
was
established,
and
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
able
to
share
and
get
feedback
from
other
poets
on
campus.
Performing
my
poetry
at
Fringe
X
established
me
as
a
writer,
and
various
other
writing
events
kept
me
inspired
and
excited
to
perform.
The
best
experience
IOve
had
as
a
writer
was
during
this
first
year
at
college
when
I
performed
one
of
my
poems
at
a
war
protest.
I
was
a
last
minute
addition
to
the
line-up
of
speakers
and
performers
who
were
intended
to
rally
the
crowd
of
over
100
people
at
another
local
college.
Many
of
my
friends
were
there
for
my
reading,
but
I
was
still
nervous
because
it
was
the
first
time
I
was
speaking
to
such
a
large
assembly.
My
poem
was
against
the
war
with
Iraq,
which
I
saw
as
unjustified.
I
intended
to
protest
the
war
with
my
poetry,
and
also
empower
the
group
of
individuals
that
were
rallying
for
peace.
Trying
to
prepare
mentally
I
recited
my
words
from
paper,
and
attempted
not
to
be
concerned
that
my
face
was
getting
red
and
I
was
sweating
from
nervousness.
Finally
I
took
the
mic
and
looked
out
into
the
sea
of
faces,
huddled
together
for
warmth
because
of
the
cold
rain.
I
before
I
started
my
slam
I
shouted,
NI
know
itOs
cold
out
here,
and
weOre
tired.
But
I
was
once
told
that
we
must
endure
if
we
are
to
have
peace.O
I
stopped
for
a
second,
took
a
deep
breath,
and
started
my
poem.
With
each
sentence
I
felt
myself
getting
lost
in
the
words.
My
arms
extended
and
swirled
in
gyrations
that
reflected
my
rhythm.
The
powerful
inflection
of
my
voice
ended
with
the
lines,
NHope
is
the
answer.
Love
is
the
answer.
Action
is
the
answer.
We
are
the
answer.O
With
the
conclusion
of
my
poem
I
heard
yells
and
applauseNmy
heart
soared.
I
felt
complete
happiness
in
knowing
that
I
had
performed
my
slam,
perfectly,
in
front
of
such
a
large
crowd.
But
more
importantly,
I
was
exhilarated
because
I
knew
that
every
word
I
said
meant
something
to
them.
Each
one
of
those
people
could
relate
to
my
words
that
urged
the
power
of
the
individual
and
the
hope
for
peace.
I
identify
myself
as
a
writer
because
writing
is
the
way
I
express
myself
the
best.
After
a
tiring
day
I
know
that
I
can
sit
alone
with
a
pen
and
paper
and
transform
any
negative
energy
IOve
encountered
into
positive
writing.
Even
if
I
end
up
hating
a
poem
IOve
created,
it
does
not
mean
that
I
do
not
see
value
in
what
was
written.
I
recognize
that
writing
can
be
more
than
a
spur
of
the
moment
conglomeration
of
emotions.
I
am
always
trying
to
perfect
my
art
through
revising
and
experimenting
by
myself
and
with
others.
With
more
practice
performing
and
writing
I
know
that
I
will
achieve
a
greater
understanding
of
my
role
as
a
writer.
Looking
back
on
my
relationship
with
writing
I
can
say
that
I
have
grown
closer
to
knowing
myself
by
working
out
my
thoughts
on
a
page.
I
am
no
longer
intimidated
at
what
others
will
think
of
my
work,
or
how
they
will
perceive
me
after
hearing
me
slam.
Writing
has
become
a
part
of
my
life
that
fuels
my
creativity
and
allows
others
to
understand
my
passion.
