W.A.
Paper
8/22/96
When
thinking
about
sharing
my
experiences
with
writing,
I
believe
that
it
is
beneficial
to
first
give
my
insights
on
why
writing
is
so
important.
Writing
is,
in
the
purest
sense,
a
speech
without
words.
It's
a
form
of
communication
that
allows
people
to
understand
each
other
without
ever
having
to
see
the
person,
smell
the
person,
or
even
talk
to
the
person.
I
enjoy
writing
because
I
can
often
say
things
in
words
that
I
could
never
communicate
through
speech.
There
are
many
people
who
have
some
phobia
about
writing;
I
never
really
felt
uncomfortable
with
putting
my
feelings
into
words.
The
following
paper
recaptures
some
of
my
most
memorable
writing
experiences
from
first
grade
through
college.
As
Mrs.
Dickinson
passed
out
the
little
writing
books,
my
heartbeat
began
to
speed
up.
Each
Monday
Mrs.
Dickinson
was
ever
so
kind
enough
to
give
a
writing
quiz
to
our
first
grade
class.
I
knew
that
I
had
practiced
my
A's,
my
B's,
and
my
S's
so
many
times
that
I
could
write
them
with
my
eyes
closed;
my
concern
was
centered
around
how
the
sweat
in
my
palms
made
my
newly-sharpened
yellow
#2
pencil
feel
like
it
had
a
coat
of
some
slippery
substance
covering
it.
Just
as
Mrs.
Dickinson
got
to
my
row,
my
pencil
slipped
from
my
hand
and
helplessly
spiraled
downward
to
the
ground.
The
impact
of
the
fall
resulted
in
the
destruction
of
my
perfectly
sharped
pencil
tip.
I
rushed
up
to
the
sharpener
and
quickly
cranked
the
awkward
device
until
my
tip
was
once
again
sharp.
My
writing
booklet
was
waiting
for
me
on
my
desk.
The
fun
was
to
begin.
In
order
to
get
a
good
grade
there
were
just
two
things
I
needed
to
do--
be
neat
and
stay
inside
the
lines.
As
I
reminisce,
it
is
blatantly
obvious
what
my
first
writing
experiences
involved.
The
teacher
presented
the
class
with
an
image
of
what
the
'proper'
letter
should
look
like
when
printed
or
when
written
in
cursive.
We
were
expected
to
imitate
these
letter
patterns
to
the
best
of
our
ability.
Whoever
replicated
the
images
with
the
most
accuracy
received
the
best
grades.
Thus,
creativity
was
definitely
not
encouraged
and
was
often
frowned
upon.
The
teacher
did
not
want
the
students
to
create
there
own
versions
of
the
letters
because
this
could
definitely
be
problematic.
It
seems
as
though
discipline
was
the
initial
focus
of
writing.
Conformity
was
another
lesson
that
was
being
taught
to
the
students.
Even
though
the
students
had
absolutely
no
idea
what
conformity
was,
they
still
learned
that
their
grade
would
suffer
if
their
letter
didn't
look
like
the
image
of
the
letter
presented
or
if
their
pencil
mark
strayed
'outside
the
lines.'
As
grade
school
progressed,
writing
inside
the
lines
was
no
longer
the
main
focus
of
my
writing
lessons.
Now
I'm
in
middle
school.
The
bell
rings
and
I
haphazardly
stuff
my
books
into
my
bookbag.
Usually
I
was
in
no
rush
at
all;
however,
I
knew
that
I
needed
to
get
to
Mr.
Detillo's
room
as
early
as
I
could
because
there
was
a
test
today.
Mr.
D's
grammar
tests
were
the
talk
of
our
middle
school.
This
was
not
grammar
in
the
sense
of
subject,
verb,
and
direct
object--
this
was
antecedents,
compound-complex
sentences,
and
subordinate
clauses.
I
picked
my
favorite
seat
in
the
room
and
sat
down
as
my
bookbag
crashed
to
the
floor
with
a
thud.
Reaching
into
my
pocket,
I
searched
for
my
mechanical
pencil.
My
fingers
probed
and
almost
pleaded
for
the
plastic
pencil.
Where
was
it?
I
plunged
my
hand
into
my
other
pocket,
aha,
there
was
my
lucky
Pentel
.07
mechanical
pencil.
Mr.
D's
tests
involved
numerous
sentences
that
had
certain
words
or
phrases
circled
in
them.
The
student's
job
was
to
decide
what
part
of
speech
the
circled
word
was.
In
the
last
section
of
his
test,
he
would
tell
us
to
write
a
sentence
that
had
"a
subject,
conjunction,
interjection,
adverbial
phrase,
etc."
Click,
click,
click...
out
came
the
lead
for
my
pencil,
hopefully
I
was
ready
for
my
grammar/writing
test.
Mr.
Detillo
probably
taught
me
more
about
writing
without
actually
teaching
writing.
By
the
time
I
left
his
class,
I
knew
grammar
so
well
that
I
never
had
to
worry
about
getting
points
taken
off
for
sloppiness
{This
doesn't
mean
I'm
perfect
because
I'm
sure
there
are
a
few
errors
in
this
paper}.
Now
that
I've
become
a
more
experienced
and
creative
writer,
I
bend
a
lot
of
the
rules
that
he
taught
me;
nevertheless,
the
solid
foundation
of
proper
grammar
still
remains
within
most
all
of
my
writings.
Mr.
D
also
allowed
creativity.
I
enjoyed
this
because
it
was
my
chance
to
show
how
my
mind
expressed
thoughts
differently
than
other
people's
minds.
Thus,
I
would
say
in
this
period
of
my
writing
experience
I
learned
that
the
mastery
of
the
language
was
paramount.
I
didn't
need
to
have
the
neatest
writing
in
the
class
nor
did
I
have
to
always
stay
inside
the
lines.
The
most
important
thing
that
Mr.
D
taught
me
about
writing
is
that
it
should
not
be
a
burden,
but
instead
one
must
love
to
do
it
as
did
he.
Mr.
D
left
an
impression
upon
me
that
probably-
actually,
definitely--
made
me
enjoy
writing
a
lot
more
than
I
had
ever
thought
I
could.
Years
passed
and
I
took
many
different
English
classes-
many
different
English
teachers.
My
college
English
courses
were
definitely
a
lot
different
than
any
previous
writing
classes.
Brainstorming
was
one
of
the
things
that
I
have
learned
how
to
do
in
college.
In
most
of
my
classes
so
far,
my
teachers
have
often
presented
the
class
with
random
topics
to
write
upon.
The
teacher
will
tell
the
class
to
pull
out
a
sheet
of
paper
and
write
for
ten
minutes
on
the
respective
topic.
I
enjoyed
this
because
it
allowed
me
to
toss
out
a
ton
of
jumbled
thoughts
without
having
to
worry
about
how
they
were
written.
By
the
time
the
ten
minutes
was
over,
I
new
how
I
would
approach
writing
a
paper
on
this
topic.
I
also
enjoyed
this
exercise
because
the
writing
was
not
graded.
This
allowed
me
to
relax
and
just
scribble
down
all
my
thoughts
without
having
the
manipulative
cloud
of
the
Almighty
grade
looming
over
my
head.
In
other
classes,
I
had
a
journal
that
I
wrote
in
for
each
class
and
handed
in
occasionally.
This
journal
usually
including
my
opinions,
confusions,
and
evaluations
of
the
literature
that
I
was
currently
reading
the
class.
I
enjoyed
this
writing
not
only
because
it
helped
to
keep
me
up
to
date
with
my
assignments,
but
it
also
helped
well
as
solve
any
puzzles
that
the
literature
may
have
presented.
All
of
my
out
of
class
writing
is
done
on
the
IBM
computers
at
Lafayette.
I
find
it
quite
humorous
that
I
used
to
always
hand-write
my
papers
and
type
the
final
draft
whereas
now
even
the
first
copies
of
any
paper
I
write
are
typed
on
the
computer.
In
college,
my
writing
has
become
increasingly
creative.
I
am
not
a
very
conventional
writer
and
most
of
the
teachers
I
have
had
find
no
problem
with
my
style.
I
have
recently
learned
probably
the
most
important
lesson
about
writing-
understanding
who
your
audience
is.
Different
teachers
prefer
different
types
of
writing
.
Some
like
creative
writing
while
others
like
simple,
conventional,
straight-to-the-point
writing.
The
writer's
main
job
is
not
simply
to
write
a
good
paper;
rather,
it
is
to
write
a
paper
that
his/her
audience
can
understand
and
appreciate.
If
your
audience
cannot
understand
nor
appreciate
your
literature,
you
might
as
well
written
it
in
some
East
African
dialect.
I
am
not
claiming
that
people
should
write
to
please
their
audience;
that
would
be
a
preposterous
assertion.
The
message
of
the
paper
should
remain
the
same;
nonetheless,
the
paper
itself
may
need
to
be
written
in
one
of
many
writing
styles
depending
upon
the
audience.
In
high
school
I
had
a
teacher
that
only
appreciated
one
type
of
writing
style.
No
matter
how
much
I
complained,
one
thing
was
for
sure,
he
wasn't
going
to
change
his
expectations
of
a
paper
to
fit
my
style.
At
this
point
in
my
writing
career,
I
chose
the
easy
and
quite
typical
path
concluding
the
Mr.
Demcheck
was
simply
an
ignorant,
conservative
*#$!%#!
who
needed
to
be
more
open
minded.
I
received
my
first
B
in
my
high
school
career
and
the
name
"Mr.
Demcheck"
will
always
leave
a
bitter
taste
in
my
mouth.
I
have
recently
had
a
non-English
department
teacher
at
Lafayette
who
expected
very
specific
things
in
every
paper.
This
person
wanted
just
the
facts.
When
I
handed
in
my
first
paper
I
was
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
this
teacher
did
not
grade
on
content,
but
rather
on
style
alone.
Bedazzled,
I
got
my
paper
back
and
got
a
'B.'
After
conversing
with
this
teacher,
I
concluded
that
I
would
need
to
write
a
very
bland,
simple,
and
almost
jejune
paper
in
order
to
receive
a
grade
I
desired.
Instead
of
complaining
to
the
Provost
or
dropping
the
class,
I
played
the
game,
so
to
say.
I
wrote
a
paper
that
would
surely
have
been
laughed
at
by
any
English
professors;
however,
this
particular
teacher
liked
my
paper,
and
I
received
a
good
grade.
This
could
serve
as
a
lesson
in
life--
sometimes
you
have
to
subvert
your
individuality
and
adjust
in
order
to
meet
expectations
and
succeed.
When
I
left
this
class,
I
smiled
because
I
knew
that
I
learned
to
write
in
a
completely
different
style
because
that
was
what
my
audience
[the
teacher]
understood
and
appreciated.
In
the
last
few
years
of
my
writing
career,
I
have
written
many
poems
and
a
few
short
stories.
I
find
that
my
writing
is
at
it's
best
when
I'm
very
emotional.
I
am
not
the
type
of
person
that
waits
until
the
last
minute
hoping
to
be
inspired;
however,
when
free-lance
writing,
I
choose
to
do
it
only
when
there
is
something
to
actually
write
about.
Thus,
I'd
have
to
say
that
true
writing
in
the
purest
sense
cannot
be
taught
nor
spoon-fed,
it
must
be
felt
and
then
unleashed
through
the
pen.
Upon
reflection,
my
habits
as
a
writer
seem
to
form
a
style
that
is
a
mixture
of
almost
every
teacher
for
which
I've
written.
